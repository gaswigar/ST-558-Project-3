chapter
on
the
look
out
in
these
times
of
ours
though
concerning
the
exact
year
there
is
no
need
to
be
precise
a
boat
of
dirty
and
disreputable
appearance
with
two
figures
in
it
floated
on
the
thames
between
southwark
bridge
which
is
of
iron
and
london
bridge
which
is
of
stone
as
an
autumn
evening
was
closing
in
the
figures
in
this
boat
were
those
of
a
strong
man
with
ragged
grizzled
hair
and
a
face
and
a
dark
girl
of
nineteen
or
twenty
sufficiently
like
him
to
be
recognizable
as
his
daughter
the
girl
rowed
pulling
a
pair
of
sculls
very
easily
the
man
with
the
slack
in
his
hands
and
his
hands
loose
in
his
waistband
kept
an
eager
look
out
he
had
no
net
hook
or
line
and
he
could
not
be
a
fisherman
his
boat
had
no
cushion
for
a
sitter
no
paint
no
inscription
no
appliance
beyond
a
rusty
boathook
and
a
coil
of
rope
and
he
could
not
be
a
waterman
his
boat
was
too
crazy
and
too
small
to
take
in
cargo
for
delivery
and
he
could
not
be
a
lighterman
or
there
was
no
clue
to
what
he
looked
for
but
he
looked
for
something
with
a
most
intent
and
searching
gaze
the
tide
which
had
turned
an
hour
before
was
running
down
and
his
eyes
watched
every
little
race
and
eddy
in
its
broad
sweep
as
the
boat
made
slight
against
it
or
drove
stern
foremost
before
it
according
as
he
directed
his
daughter
by
a
movement
of
his
head
she
watched
his
face
as
earnestly
as
he
watched
the
river
but
in
the
intensity
of
her
look
there
was
a
touch
of
dread
or
horror
allied
to
the
bottom
of
the
river
rather
than
the
surface
by
reason
of
the
slime
and
ooze
with
which
it
was
covered
and
its
sodden
state
this
boat
and
the
two
figures
in
it
obviously
were
doing
something
that
they
often
did
and
were
seeking
what
they
often
sought
half
savage
as
the
man
showed
with
no
covering
on
his
matted
head
with
his
brown
arms
bare
to
between
the
elbow
and
the
shoulder
with
the
loose
knot
of
a
looser
kerchief
lying
low
on
his
bare
breast
in
a
wilderness
of
beard
and
whisker
with
such
dress
as
he
wore
seeming
to
be
made
out
of
the
mud
that
begrimed
his
boat
still
there
was
a
usage
in
his
steady
gaze
so
with
every
lithe
action
of
the
girl
with
every
turn
of
her
wrist
perhaps
most
of
all
with
her
look
of
dread
or
horror
they
were
things
of
usage
her
out
lizzie
tide
runs
strong
here
keep
her
well
afore
the
sweep
of
it
trusting
to
the
girl
skill
and
making
no
use
of
the
rudder
he
eyed
the
coming
tide
with
an
absorbed
attention
so
the
girl
eyed
him
but
it
happened
now
that
a
slant
of
light
from
the
setting
sun
glanced
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
touching
a
rotten
stain
there
which
bore
some
resemblance
to
the
outline
of
a
muffled
human
form
coloured
it
as
though
with
diluted
blood
this
caught
the
girl
eye
and
she
shivered
ails
you
said
the
man
immediately
aware
of
it
though
so
intent
on
the
advancing
waters
see
nothing
afloat
the
red
light
was
gone
the
shudder
was
gone
and
his
gaze
which
had
come
back
to
the
boat
for
a
moment
travelled
away
again
wheresoever
the
strong
tide
met
with
an
impediment
his
gaze
paused
for
an
instant
at
every
and
rope
at
every
stationery
boat
or
barge
that
split
the
current
into
a
at
the
offsets
from
the
piers
of
southwark
bridge
at
the
paddles
of
the
river
steamboats
as
they
beat
the
filthy
water
at
the
floating
logs
of
timber
lashed
together
lying
off
certain
wharves
his
shining
eyes
darted
a
hungry
look
after
a
darkening
hour
or
so
suddenly
the
tightened
in
his
hold
and
he
steered
hard
towards
the
surrey
shore
always
watching
his
face
the
girl
instantly
answered
to
the
action
in
her
sculling
presently
the
boat
swung
round
quivered
as
from
a
sudden
jerk
and
the
upper
half
of
the
man
was
stretched
out
over
the
stern
the
girl
pulled
the
hood
of
a
cloak
she
wore
over
her
head
and
over
her
face
and
looking
backward
so
that
the
front
folds
of
this
hood
were
turned
down
the
river
kept
the
boat
in
that
direction
going
before
the
tide
until
now
the
boat
had
barely
held
her
own
and
had
hovered
about
one
spot
but
now
the
banks
changed
swiftly
and
the
deepening
shadows
and
the
kindling
lights
of
london
bridge
were
passed
and
the
tiers
of
shipping
lay
on
either
hand
it
was
not
until
now
that
the
upper
half
of
the
man
came
back
into
the
boat
his
arms
were
wet
and
dirty
and
he
washed
them
over
the
side
in
his
right
hand
he
held
something
and
he
washed
that
in
the
river
too
it
was
money
he
chinked
it
once
and
he
blew
upon
it
once
and
he
spat
upon
it
once
luck
he
hoarsely
said
before
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
the
girl
turned
her
face
towards
him
with
a
start
and
rowed
in
silence
her
face
was
very
pale
he
was
a
man
and
with
that
and
his
bright
eyes
and
his
ruffled
head
bore
a
certain
likeness
to
a
roused
bird
of
prey
that
thing
off
your
face
she
put
it
back
and
give
me
hold
of
the
sculls
i
take
the
rest
of
the
spell
no
father
no
i
ca
indeed
father
i
can
not
sit
so
near
it
he
was
moving
towards
her
to
change
places
but
her
terrified
expostulation
stopped
him
and
he
resumed
his
seat
hurt
can
it
do
you
none
but
i
can
not
bear
it
my
belief
you
hate
the
sight
of
the
very
river
i
do
not
like
it
father
if
it
was
your
living
as
if
it
was
meat
and
drink
to
you
at
these
latter
words
the
girl
shivered
again
and
for
a
moment
paused
in
her
rowing
seeming
to
turn
deadly
faint
it
escaped
his
attention
for
he
was
glancing
over
the
stern
at
something
the
boat
had
in
tow
can
you
be
so
thankless
to
your
best
friend
lizzie
the
very
fire
that
warmed
you
when
you
were
a
babby
was
picked
out
of
the
river
alongside
the
coal
barges
the
very
basket
that
you
slept
in
the
tide
washed
ashore
the
very
rockers
that
i
put
it
upon
to
make
a
cradle
of
it
i
cut
out
of
a
piece
of
wood
that
drifted
from
some
ship
or
another
lizzie
took
her
right
hand
from
the
scull
it
held
and
touched
her
lips
with
it
and
for
a
moment
held
it
out
lovingly
towards
him
then
without
speaking
she
resumed
her
rowing
as
another
boat
of
similar
appearance
though
in
rather
better
trim
came
out
from
a
dark
place
and
dropped
softly
alongside
luck
again
gaffer
said
a
man
with
a
squinting
leer
who
sculled
her
and
who
was
alone
know
you
was
in
luck
again
by
your
wake
as
you
come
down
replied
the
other
drily
you
out
are
you
pardner
there
was
now
a
tender
yellow
moonlight
on
the
river
and
the
new
comer
keeping
half
his
boat
length
astern
of
the
other
boat
looked
hard
at
its
track
says
to
myself
he
went
on
you
hove
in
view
gaffer
and
in
luck
again
by
george
if
he
ai
scull
it
is
pardner
do
fret
yourself
i
did
touch
him
this
was
in
answer
to
a
quick
impatient
movement
on
the
part
of
gaffer
the
speaker
at
the
same
time
unshipping
his
scull
on
that
side
and
laying
his
hand
on
the
gunwale
of
gaffer
boat
and
holding
to
it
had
touches
enough
not
to
want
no
more
as
well
as
i
make
him
out
gaffer
been
a
knocking
about
with
a
pretty
many
tides
ai
he
pardner
such
is
my
ways
you
see
he
must
have
passed
me
when
he
went
up
last
time
for
i
was
on
the
lookout
below
bridge
here
i
think
you
like
the
wulturs
pardner
and
scent
out
he
spoke
in
a
dropped
voice
and
with
more
than
one
glance
at
lizzie
who
had
pulled
on
her
hood
again
both
men
then
looked
with
a
weird
unholy
interest
in
the
wake
of
gaffer
boat
does
it
betwixt
us
shall
i
take
him
aboard
pardner
said
the
other
in
so
surly
a
tone
that
the
man
after
a
blank
stare
acknowledged
it
with
the
retort
ar
been
eating
nothing
as
has
disagreed
with
you
have
you
pardner
yes
i
have
said
gaffer
have
been
swallowing
too
much
of
that
word
pardner
i
am
no
pardner
of
yours
when
was
you
no
pardner
of
mine
gaffer
hexam
esquire
you
was
accused
of
robbing
a
man
accused
of
robbing
a
live
man
said
gaffer
with
great
indignation
what
if
i
had
been
accused
of
robbing
a
dead
man
gaffer
could
do
it
you
gaffer
has
a
dead
man
any
use
for
money
is
it
possible
for
a
dead
man
to
have
money
what
world
does
a
dead
man
belong
to
world
what
world
does
money
belong
to
this
world
how
can
money
be
a
corpse
can
a
corpse
own
it
want
it
spend
it
claim
it
miss
it
do
try
to
go
confounding
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
things
in
that
way
but
it
worthy
of
the
sneaking
spirit
that
robs
a
live
man
tell
you
what
it
is
you
wo
i
tell
you
what
it
is
you
got
off
with
a
short
time
of
it
for
putting
your
hand
in
the
pocket
of
a
sailor
a
live
sailor
make
the
most
of
it
and
think
yourself
lucky
but
do
think
after
that
to
come
over
me
with
your
pardners
we
have
worked
together
in
time
past
but
we
work
together
no
more
in
time
present
nor
yet
future
let
go
cast
off
if
you
think
to
get
rid
of
me
this
way
i
do
get
rid
of
you
this
way
i
try
another
and
chop
you
over
the
fingers
with
the
stretcher
or
take
a
pick
at
your
head
with
the
cast
off
pull
you
lizzie
pull
home
since
you
wo
let
your
father
pull
lizzie
shot
ahead
and
the
other
boat
fell
astern
lizzie
father
composing
himself
into
the
easy
attitude
of
one
who
had
asserted
the
high
moralities
and
taken
an
unassailable
position
slowly
lighted
a
pipe
and
smoked
and
took
a
survey
of
what
he
had
in
tow
what
he
had
in
tow
lunged
itself
at
him
sometimes
in
an
awful
manner
when
the
boat
was
checked
and
sometimes
seemed
to
try
to
wrench
itself
away
though
for
the
most
part
it
followed
submissively
a
neophyte
might
have
fancied
that
the
ripples
passing
over
it
were
dreadfully
like
faint
changes
of
expression
on
a
sightless
face
but
gaffer
was
no
neophyte
and
had
no
fancies
chapter
the
man
from
somewhere
mr
and
mrs
veneering
were
people
in
a
house
in
a
quarter
of
london
everything
about
the
veneerings
was
spick
and
span
new
all
their
furniture
was
new
all
their
friends
were
new
all
their
servants
were
new
their
plate
was
new
their
carriage
was
new
their
harness
was
new
their
horses
were
new
their
pictures
were
new
they
themselves
were
new
they
were
as
newly
married
as
was
lawfully
compatible
with
their
having
a
baby
and
if
they
had
set
up
a
he
would
have
come
home
in
matting
from
the
pantechnicon
without
a
scratch
upon
him
french
polished
to
the
crown
of
his
head
for
in
the
veneering
establishment
from
the
with
the
new
coat
of
arms
to
the
grand
pianoforte
with
the
new
action
and
upstairs
again
to
the
new
all
things
were
in
a
state
of
high
varnish
and
polish
and
what
was
observable
in
the
furniture
was
observable
in
the
veneerings
the
surface
smelt
a
little
too
much
of
the
workshop
and
was
a
trifle
sticky
there
was
an
innocent
piece
of
that
went
upon
easy
castors
and
was
kept
over
a
livery
in
duke
street
saint
james
when
not
in
use
to
whom
the
veneerings
were
a
source
of
blind
confusion
the
name
of
this
article
was
twemlow
being
first
cousin
to
lord
snigsworth
he
was
in
frequent
requisition
and
at
many
houses
might
be
said
to
represent
the
in
its
normal
state
mr
and
mrs
veneering
for
example
arranging
a
dinner
habitually
started
with
twemlow
and
then
put
leaves
in
him
or
added
guests
to
him
sometimes
the
table
consisted
of
twemlow
and
half
a
dozen
leaves
sometimes
of
twemlow
and
a
dozen
leaves
sometimes
twemlow
was
pulled
out
to
his
utmost
extent
of
twenty
leaves
mr
and
mrs
veneering
on
occasions
of
ceremony
faced
each
other
in
the
centre
of
the
board
and
thus
the
parallel
still
held
for
it
always
happened
that
the
more
twemlow
was
pulled
out
the
further
he
found
himself
from
the
center
and
nearer
to
the
sideboard
at
one
end
of
the
room
or
the
at
the
other
but
it
was
not
this
which
steeped
the
feeble
soul
of
twemlow
in
confusion
this
he
was
used
to
and
could
take
soundings
of
the
abyss
to
which
he
could
find
no
bottom
and
from
which
started
forth
the
engrossing
and
difficulty
of
his
life
was
the
insoluble
question
whether
he
was
veneering
oldest
friend
or
newest
friend
to
the
excogitation
of
this
problem
the
harmless
gentleman
had
devoted
many
anxious
hours
both
in
his
lodgings
over
the
livery
and
in
the
cold
gloom
favourable
to
meditation
of
saint
square
thus
twemlow
had
first
known
veneering
at
his
club
where
veneering
then
knew
nobody
but
the
man
who
made
them
known
to
one
another
who
seemed
to
be
the
most
intimate
friend
he
had
in
the
world
and
whom
he
had
known
two
days
the
bond
of
union
between
their
souls
the
nefarious
conduct
of
the
committee
respecting
the
cookery
of
a
fillet
of
veal
having
been
accidentally
cemented
at
that
date
immediately
upon
this
twemlow
received
an
invitation
to
dine
with
veneering
and
dined
the
man
being
of
the
party
immediately
upon
that
twemlow
received
an
invitation
to
dine
with
the
man
and
dined
veneering
being
of
the
party
at
the
man
were
a
member
an
engineer
a
of
the
national
debt
a
poem
on
shakespeare
a
grievance
and
a
public
office
who
all
seem
to
be
utter
strangers
to
veneering
and
yet
immediately
after
that
twemlow
received
an
invitation
to
dine
at
veneerings
expressly
to
meet
the
member
the
engineer
the
of
the
national
debt
the
poem
on
shakespeare
the
grievance
and
the
public
office
and
dining
discovered
that
all
of
them
were
the
most
intimate
friends
veneering
had
in
the
world
and
that
the
wives
of
all
of
them
who
were
all
there
were
the
objects
of
mrs
veneering
most
devoted
affection
and
tender
confidence
thus
it
had
come
about
that
mr
twemlow
had
said
to
himself
in
his
lodgings
with
his
hand
to
his
forehead
must
not
think
of
this
this
is
enough
to
soften
any
man
brain
and
yet
was
always
thinking
of
it
and
could
never
form
a
conclusion
this
evening
the
veneerings
give
a
banquet
eleven
leaves
in
the
twemlow
fourteen
in
company
all
told
four
retainers
in
plain
clothes
stand
in
line
in
the
hall
a
fifth
retainer
proceeding
up
the
staircase
with
a
mournful
air
as
who
should
say
is
another
wretched
creature
come
to
dinner
such
is
life
announces
twemlow
mrs
veneering
welcomes
her
sweet
mr
twemlow
mr
veneering
welcomes
his
dear
twemlow
mrs
veneering
does
not
expect
that
mr
twemlow
can
in
nature
care
much
for
such
insipid
things
as
babies
but
so
old
a
friend
must
please
to
look
at
baby
you
will
know
the
friend
of
your
family
better
tootleums
says
mr
veneering
nodding
emotionally
at
that
new
article
you
begin
to
take
notice
he
then
begs
to
make
his
dear
twemlow
known
to
his
two
friends
mr
boots
and
mr
brewer
and
clearly
has
no
distinct
idea
which
is
which
but
now
a
fearful
circumstance
occurs
and
podsnap
dear
says
mr
veneering
to
mrs
veneering
with
an
air
of
much
friendly
interest
while
the
door
stands
open
podsnaps
a
too
too
smiling
large
man
with
a
fatal
freshness
on
him
appearing
with
his
wife
instantly
deserts
his
wife
and
darts
at
twemlow
with
do
you
do
so
glad
to
know
you
charming
house
you
have
here
i
hope
we
are
not
late
so
glad
of
the
opportunity
i
am
sure
when
the
first
shock
fell
upon
him
twemlow
twice
skipped
back
in
his
neat
little
shoes
and
his
neat
little
silk
stockings
of
a
bygone
fashion
as
if
impelled
to
leap
over
a
sofa
behind
him
but
the
large
man
closed
with
him
and
proved
too
strong
me
says
the
large
man
trying
to
attract
the
attention
of
his
wife
in
the
distance
the
pleasure
of
presenting
mrs
podsnap
to
her
host
she
will
be
in
his
fatal
freshness
he
seems
to
find
perpetual
verdure
and
eternal
youth
in
the
phrase
will
be
so
glad
of
the
opportunity
i
am
sure
in
the
meantime
mrs
podsnap
unable
to
originate
a
mistake
on
her
own
account
because
mrs
veneering
is
the
only
other
lady
there
does
her
best
in
the
way
of
handsomely
supporting
her
husband
by
looking
towards
mr
twemlow
with
a
plaintive
countenance
and
remarking
to
mrs
veneering
in
a
feeling
manner
firstly
that
she
fears
he
has
been
rather
bilious
of
late
and
secondly
that
the
baby
is
already
very
like
him
it
is
questionable
whether
any
man
quite
relishes
being
mistaken
for
any
other
man
but
mr
veneering
having
this
very
evening
set
up
the
of
the
young
antinous
in
new
worked
cambric
just
come
home
is
not
at
all
complimented
by
being
supposed
to
be
twemlow
who
is
dry
and
weazen
and
some
thirty
years
older
mrs
veneering
equally
resents
the
imputation
of
being
the
wife
of
twemlow
as
to
twemlow
he
is
so
sensible
of
being
a
much
better
bred
man
than
veneering
that
he
considers
the
large
man
an
offensive
ass
in
this
complicated
dilemma
mr
veneering
approaches
the
large
man
with
extended
hand
and
smilingly
assures
that
incorrigible
personage
that
he
is
delighted
to
see
him
who
in
his
fatal
freshness
instantly
replies
you
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
i
can
not
at
this
moment
recall
where
we
met
but
i
am
so
glad
of
this
opportunity
i
am
sure
then
pouncing
upon
twemlow
who
holds
back
with
all
his
feeble
might
he
is
haling
him
off
to
present
him
as
veneering
to
mrs
podsnap
when
the
arrival
of
more
guests
unravels
the
mistake
whereupon
having
hands
with
veneering
as
veneering
he
hands
with
twemlow
as
twemlow
and
winds
it
all
up
to
his
own
perfect
satisfaction
by
saying
to
the
opportunity
but
so
glad
of
it
i
am
sure
now
twemlow
having
undergone
this
terrific
experience
having
likewise
noted
the
fusion
of
boots
in
brewer
and
brewer
in
boots
and
having
further
observed
that
of
the
remaining
seven
guests
four
discrete
characters
enter
with
wandering
eyes
and
wholly
declined
to
commit
themselves
as
to
which
is
veneering
until
veneering
has
them
in
his
grasp
twemlow
having
profited
by
these
studies
finds
his
brain
wholesomely
hardening
as
he
approaches
the
conclusion
that
he
really
is
veneering
oldest
friend
when
his
brain
softens
again
and
all
is
lost
through
his
eyes
encountering
veneering
and
the
large
man
linked
together
as
twin
brothers
in
the
back
near
the
conservatory
door
and
through
his
ears
informing
him
in
the
tones
of
mrs
veneering
that
the
same
large
man
is
to
be
baby
godfather
is
on
the
table
thus
the
melancholy
retainer
as
who
should
say
down
and
be
poisoned
ye
unhappy
children
of
men
twemlow
having
no
lady
assigned
him
goes
down
in
the
rear
with
his
hand
to
his
forehead
boots
and
brewer
thinking
him
indisposed
whisper
faint
had
no
lunch
but
he
is
only
stunned
by
the
unvanquishable
difficulty
of
his
existence
revived
by
soup
twemlow
discourses
mildly
of
the
court
circular
with
boots
and
brewer
is
appealed
to
at
the
fish
stage
of
the
banquet
by
veneering
on
the
disputed
question
whether
his
cousin
lord
snigsworth
is
in
or
out
of
town
gives
it
that
his
cousin
is
out
of
town
snigsworthy
park
veneering
inquires
snigsworthy
twemlow
rejoins
boots
and
brewer
regard
this
as
a
man
to
be
cultivated
and
veneering
is
clear
that
he
is
a
remunerative
article
meantime
the
retainer
goes
round
like
a
gloomy
analytical
chemist

seeming
to
say

goes
well

lady

made
a

of
experiments
on

so
extremely
complicated

daring

if
they
could

are

words
fall
from

assure
you
my
dear
veneering
poor
twemlow
hand
approaches
his
forehead
for
it
would
seem
now
that
lady
tippins
is
going
to
be
the
oldest
friend
assure
you
my
dear
veneering
that
it
is
the
oddest
affair
like
the
advertising
people
i
do
ask
you
to
trust
me
without
offering
a
respectable
reference
mortimer
there
is
my
reference
and
knows
all
about
it
mortimer
raises
his
drooping
eyelids
and
slightly
opens
his
mouth
but
a
faint
smile
expressive
of
the
use
passes
over
his
face
and
he
drops
his
eyelids
and
shuts
his
mouth
mortimer
says
lady
tippins
rapping
the
sticks
of
her
closed
green
fan
upon
the
knuckles
of
her
left
hand
which
is
particularly
rich
in
knuckles
insist
upon
your
telling
all
that
is
to
be
told
about
the
man
from
jamaica
you
my
honour
i
never
heard
of
any
man
from
jamaica
except
the
man
who
was
a
brother
replies
mortimer
then
yet
from
tobago
eugene
strikes
in
so
unexpectedly
that
the
mature
young
lady
who
has
forgotten
all
about
him
with
a
start
takes
the
epaulette
out
of
his
way
our
friend
who
long
lived
on
and
isinglass
till
at
length
to
his
something
or
other
his
physician
said
something
else
and
a
leg
of
mutton
somehow
ended
in
daygo
a
reviving
impression
goes
round
the
table
that
eugene
is
coming
out
an
unfulfilled
impression
for
he
goes
in
again
my
dear
mrs
veneering
quoth
lady
tippins
i
appeal
to
you
whether
this
is
not
the
basest
conduct
ever
known
in
this
world
i
carry
my
lovers
about
two
or
three
at
a
time
on
condition
that
they
are
very
obedient
and
devoted
and
here
is
my
oldest
the
head
of
all
my
slaves
throwing
off
his
allegiance
before
company
and
here
is
another
of
my
lovers
a
rough
cymon
at
present
certainly
but
of
whom
i
had
most
hopeful
expectations
as
to
his
turning
out
well
in
course
of
time
pretending
that
he
ca
remember
his
nursery
rhymes
on
purpose
to
annoy
me
for
he
knows
how
i
doat
upon
them
a
grisly
little
fiction
concerning
her
lovers
is
lady
tippins
point
she
is
always
attended
by
a
lover
or
two
and
she
keeps
a
little
list
of
her
lovers
and
she
is
always
booking
a
new
lover
or
striking
out
an
old
lover
or
putting
a
lover
in
her
black
list
or
promoting
a
lover
to
her
blue
list
or
adding
up
her
lovers
or
otherwise
posting
her
book
mrs
veneering
is
charmed
by
the
humour
and
so
is
veneering
perhaps
it
is
enhanced
by
a
certain
yellow
play
in
lady
tippins
throat
like
the
legs
of
scratching
poultry
banish
the
false
wretch
from
this
moment
and
i
strike
him
out
of
my
cupidon
my
name
for
my
ledger
my
dear
this
very
night
but
i
am
resolved
to
have
the
account
of
the
man
from
somewhere
and
i
beg
you
to
elicit
it
for
me
my
love
to
mrs
veneering
i
have
lost
my
own
influence
oh
you
perjured
man
this
to
mortimer
with
a
rattle
of
her
fan
are
all
very
much
interested
in
the
man
from
somewhere
veneering
observes
then
the
four
buffers
taking
heart
of
grace
all
four
at
once
say
interested
excited
from
nowhere
perhaps
and
then
mrs
veneering
for
the
lady
tippins
winning
wiles
are
contagious
folds
her
hands
in
the
manner
of
a
supplicating
child
turns
to
her
left
neighbour
and
says
pay
man
from
tumwhere
at
which
the
four
buffers
again
mysteriously
moved
all
four
at
once
explain
ca
resist
my
life
says
mortimer
languidly
find
it
immensely
embarrassing
to
have
the
eyes
of
europe
upon
me
to
this
extent
and
my
only
consolation
is
that
you
will
all
of
you
execrate
lady
tippins
in
your
secret
hearts
when
you
find
as
you
inevitably
will
the
man
from
somewhere
a
bore
sorry
to
destroy
romance
by
fixing
him
with
a
local
habitation
but
he
comes
from
the
place
the
name
of
which
escapes
me
but
will
suggest
itself
to
everybody
else
here
where
they
make
the
wine
eugene
suggests
and
martin
not
that
place
returns
the
unmoved
mortimer
where
they
make
the
port
my
man
comes
from
the
country
where
they
make
the
cape
wine
but
look
here
old
fellow
its
not
at
all
statistical
and
rather
odd
it
is
always
noticeable
at
the
table
of
the
veneerings
that
no
man
troubles
himself
much
about
the
veneerings
themselves
and
that
any
one
who
has
anything
to
tell
generally
tells
it
to
anybody
else
in
preference
man
mortimer
goes
on
addressing
eugene
name
is
harmon
was
only
son
of
a
tremendous
old
rascal
who
made
his
money
by
dust
velveteens
and
a
bell
the
gloomy
eugene
inquires
a
ladder
and
basket
if
you
like
by
which
means
or
by
others
he
grew
rich
as
a
dust
contractor
and
lived
in
a
hollow
in
a
hilly
country
entirely
composed
of
dust
on
his
own
small
estate
the
growling
old
vagabond
threw
up
his
own
mountain
range
like
an
old
volcano
and
its
geological
formation
was
dust
crockery
dust
rough
dust
and
sifted
dust
all
manner
of
dust
a
passing
remembrance
of
mrs
veneering
here
induces
mortimer
to
address
his
next
words
to
her
after
which
he
wanders
away
again
tries
twemlow
and
finds
he
does
answer
ultimately
takes
up
with
the
buffers
who
receive
him
enthusiastically
moral
being
i
believe
that
the
right
expression
of
this
exemplary
person
derived
its
highest
gratification
from
anathematizing
his
nearest
relations
and
turning
them
out
of
doors
having
begun
as
was
natural
by
rendering
these
attentions
to
the
wife
of
his
bosom
he
next
found
himself
at
leisure
to
bestow
a
similar
recognition
on
the
claims
of
his
daughter
he
chose
a
husband
for
her
entirely
to
his
own
satisfaction
and
not
in
the
least
to
hers
and
proceeded
to
settle
upon
her
as
her
marriage
portion
i
do
know
how
much
dust
but
something
immense
at
this
stage
of
the
affair
the
poor
girl
respectfully
intimated
that
she
was
secretly
engaged
to
that
popular
character
whom
the
novelists
and
versifiers
call
another
and
that
such
a
marriage
would
make
dust
of
her
heart
and
dust
of
her
life
in
short
would
set
her
up
on
a
very
extensive
scale
in
her
father
business
immediately
the
venerable
parent
on
a
cold
winter
night
it
is
said
anathematized
and
turned
her
out
here
the
analytical
chemist
who
has
evidently
formed
a
very
low
opinion
of
mortimer
story
concedes
a
little
claret
to
the
buffers
who
again
mysteriously
moved
all
four
at
once
screw
it
slowly
into
themselves
with
a
peculiar
twist
of
enjoyment
as
they
cry
in
chorus
go
on
pecuniary
resources
of
another
were
as
they
usually
are
of
a
very
limited
nature
i
believe
i
am
not
using
too
strong
an
expression
when
i
say
that
another
was
hard
up
however
he
married
the
young
lady
and
they
lived
in
a
humble
dwelling
probably
possessing
a
porch
ornamented
with
honeysuckle
and
woodbine
twining
until
she
died
i
must
refer
you
to
the
registrar
of
the
district
in
which
the
humble
dwelling
was
situated
for
the
certified
cause
of
death
but
early
sorrow
and
anxiety
may
have
had
to
do
with
it
though
they
may
not
appear
in
the
ruled
pages
and
printed
forms
indisputably
this
was
the
case
with
another
for
he
was
so
cut
up
by
the
loss
of
his
young
wife
that
if
he
outlived
her
a
year
it
was
as
much
as
he
did
there
is
that
in
the
indolent
mortimer
which
seems
to
hint
that
if
good
society
might
on
any
account
allow
itself
to
be
impressible
he
one
of
good
society
might
have
the
weakness
to
be
impressed
by
what
he
here
relates
it
is
hidden
with
great
pains
but
it
is
in
him
the
gloomy
eugene
too
is
not
without
some
kindred
touch
for
when
that
appalling
lady
tippins
declares
that
if
another
had
survived
he
should
have
gone
down
at
the
head
of
her
list
of
lovers
and
also
when
the
mature
young
lady
shrugs
her
epaulettes
and
laughs
at
some
private
and
confidential
comment
from
the
mature
young
gentleman
his
gloom
deepens
to
that
degree
that
he
trifles
quite
ferociously
with
his
mortimer
proceeds
must
now
return
as
novelists
say
and
as
we
all
wish
they
would
to
the
man
from
somewhere
being
a
boy
of
fourteen
cheaply
educated
at
brussels
when
his
sister
expulsion
befell
it
was
some
little
time
before
he
heard
of
it
probably
from
herself
for
the
mother
was
dead
but
that
i
do
know
instantly
he
absconded
and
came
over
here
he
must
have
been
a
boy
of
spirit
and
resource
to
get
here
on
a
stopped
allowance
of
five
sous
a
week
but
he
did
it
somehow
and
he
burst
in
on
his
father
and
pleaded
his
sister
cause
venerable
parent
promptly
resorts
to
anathematization
and
turns
him
out
shocked
and
terrified
boy

flight
seeks
his
fortune
gets
aboard
ship
ultimately
turns
up
on
dry
land
among
the

proprietor

whatever
you
like
to
call
it
at
this
juncture
shuffling
is
heard
in
the
hall
and
tapping
is
heard
at
the
door
analytical
chemist
goes
to
the
door
confers
angrily
with
unseen
tapper
appears
to
become
mollified
by
descrying
reason
in
the
tapping
and
goes
out
he
was
discovered
only
the
other
day
after
having
been
expatriated
about
fourteen
years
a
buffer
suddenly
astounding
the
other
three
by
detaching
himself
and
asserting
individuality
inquires
discovered
and
why
to
be
sure
thank
you
for
reminding
me
venerable
parent

emboldened
by
success
says
other
day
ten
or
twelve
months
ago
same
buffer
inquires
with
smartness
of
but
herein
perishes
a
melancholy
example
being
regarded
by
the
three
other
buffers
with
a
stony
stare
and
attracting
no
further
attention
from
any
mortal
parent
mortimer
repeats
with
a
passing
remembrance
that
there
is
a
veneering
at
table
and
for
the
first
time
addressing
him
the
gratified
veneering
repeats
gravely
and
folds
his
arms
and
composes
his
brow
to
hear
it
out
in
a
judicial
manner
when
he
finds
himself
again
deserted
in
the
bleak
world

soon
after

sort
of

its

to
an
old
servant
who
is
sole
executor
and
all
the
rest
of
the
property
which
is
very
considerable
to
the

he
directs
himself
to
be
buried
with
certain
eccentric
ceremonies
and
precautions
against
his
coming
to
life
with
which
i
need
not
bore
you
and
that
all
except
and
this
ends
the
story
the
analytical
chemist
returning
everybody
looks
at
him
not
because
anybody
wants
to
see
him
but
because
of
that
subtle
influence
in
nature
which
impels
humanity
to
embrace
the
slightest
opportunity
of
looking
at
anything
rather
than
the
person

that
the

inheriting

made
conditional
on
his
marrying
a

at
the

and
at
the

he
is
on
his

home
from

no
doubt
in
a
state
of
great
astonishment

large

and
to

whether

what

become
of

very
large
fortune
in
the
event
of

mortimer
replies
that
by
special
testamentary
clause
it
would
then
go
to
the
old
servant
above
mentioned
passing
over

excluding

just
succeeded
in
waking

tippins
from
a
snore
by
dexterously
shunting
a
train
of
plates
and
dishes
at
her
knuckles
across
the
table
when
everybody
but
mortimer
himself
becomes
aware
that
the
analytical
chemist
is
in
a
ghostly
manner
offering
him
a
folded
paper
curiosity
detains
mrs
veneering
a
few
moments
mortimer
in
spite
of
all
the
arts
of
the
chemist
placidly
refreshes
himself
with
a
glass
of
madeira
and
remains
unconscious
of
the
document
which
engrosses
the
general
attention
until
lady
tippins
who
has
a
habit
of
waking
totally
insensible
having
remembered
where
she
is
and
recovered
a
perception
of
surrounding
objects
says
man
than
don
juan
why
do
you
take
the
note
from
the
commendatore
upon
which
the
chemist
advances
it
under
the
nose
of
mortimer
who
looks
round
at
him
and
says
this
analytical
chemist
bends
and
whispers
says
mortimer
analytical
chemist
again
bends
and
whispers
mortimer
stares
at
him
and
unfolds
the
paper
reads
it
reads
it
twice
turns
it
over
to
look
at
the
blank
outside
reads
it
a
third
time
arrives
in
an
extraordinarily
opportune
manner
says
mortimer
then
looking
with
an
altered
face
round
the
table
is
the
conclusion
of
the
story
of
the
identical
man
married
one
guesses
to
marry
another
guesses
among
the
dust
another
guesses
no
says
mortimer
thing
you
are
all
wrong
the
story
is
completer
and
rather
more
exciting
than
i
supposed
drowned
chapter
another
man
as
the
disappearing
skirts
of
the
ladies
ascended
the
veneering
staircase
mortimer
following
them
forth
from
the
turned
into
a
library
of
books
in
bindings
liberally
gilded
and
requested
to
see
the
messenger
who
had
brought
the
paper
he
was
a
boy
of
about
fifteen
mortimer
looked
at
the
boy
and
the
boy
looked
at
the
pilgrims
on
the
wall
going
to
canterbury
in
more
gold
frame
than
procession
and
more
carving
than
country
writing
is
this
sir
told
you
to
write
it
father
jesse
hexam
it
he
who
found
the
body
sir
is
your
father
the
boy
hesitated
looked
reproachfully
at
the
pilgrims
as
if
they
had
involved
him
in
a
little
difficulty
then
said
folding
a
plait
in
the
right
leg
of
his
trousers
gets
his
living
it
far
which
far
asked
the
boy
upon
his
guard
and
again
upon
the
road
to
canterbury
your
father
a
goodish
stretch
sir
i
come
up
in
a
cab
and
the
cab
waiting
to
be
paid
we
could
go
back
in
it
before
you
paid
it
if
you
liked
i
went
first
to
your
office
according
to
the
direction
of
the
papers
found
in
the
pockets
and
there
i
see
nobody
but
a
chap
of
about
my
age
who
sent
me
on
here
there
was
a
curious
mixture
in
the
boy
of
uncompleted
savagery
and
uncompleted
civilization
his
voice
was
hoarse
and
coarse
and
his
face
was
coarse
and
his
stunted
figure
was
coarse
but
he
was
cleaner
than
other
boys
of
his
type
and
his
writing
though
large
and
round
was
good
and
he
glanced
at
the
backs
of
the
books
with
an
awakened
curiosity
that
went
below
the
binding
no
one
who
can
read
ever
looks
at
a
book
even
unopened
on
a
shelf
like
one
who
can
not
any
means
taken
do
you
know
boy
to
ascertain
if
it
was
possible
to
restore
life
mortimer
inquired
as
he
sought
for
his
hat
would
ask
sir
if
you
knew
his
state
pharaoh
multitude
that
were
drowned
in
the
red
sea
ai
more
beyond
restoring
to
life
if
lazarus
was
only
half
as
far
gone
that
was
the
greatest
of
all
the
miracles
cried
mortimer
turning
round
with
his
hat
upon
his
head
seem
to
be
at
home
in
the
red
sea
my
young
friend
of
it
with
teacher
at
the
school
said
the
boy
lazarus
and
him
too
but
do
you
tell
my
father
we
should
have
no
peace
in
our
place
if
that
got
touched
upon
it
my
sister
contriving
seem
to
have
a
good
sister
ai
half
bad
said
the
boy
if
she
knows
her
letters
the
most
she
does
and
them
i
learned
her
the
gloomy
eugene
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
had
strolled
in
and
assisted
at
the
latter
part
of
the
dialogue
when
the
boy
spoke
these
words
slightingly
of
his
sister
he
took
him
roughly
enough
by
the
chin
and
turned
up
his
face
to
look
at
it
i
sure
sir
said
the
boy
resisting
hope
you
know
me
again
eugene
vouchsafed
no
answer
but
made
the
proposal
to
mortimer
go
with
you
if
you
like
so
they
all
three
went
away
together
in
the
vehicle
that
had
brought
the
boy
the
two
friends
once
boys
together
at
a
public
school
inside
smoking
cigars
the
messenger
on
the
box
beside
the
driver

said
mortimer
as
they
went
along

been

had
no

this
romantic
business
i
said
eugene
been
called
seven
years
and
have
had
no
business
at
all
and
never
shall
have
any
and
if
i
had
i
know
how
to
do
it
am
far
from
being
clear
as
to
the
last
particular
returned
mortimer
with
great
composure
i
have
much
advantage
over
you
hate
said
eugene
putting
his
legs
up
on
the
opposite
seat
hate
my
profession
i
incommode
you
if
i
put
mine
up
too
returned
mortimer
you
i
hate
mine
was
forced
upon
me
said
the
gloomy
eugene
it
was
understood
that
we
wanted
a
barrister
in
the
family
we
have
got
a
precious
one
was
forced
upon
me
said
mortimer
it
was
understood
that
we
wanted
a
solicitor
in
the
family
and
we
have
got
a
precious
one
are
four
of
us
with
our
names
painted
on
a
in
right
of
one
black

called

said
eugene
each
of
us
has
the
fourth

a

in
the
robber
cave
and
cassim
is
the
only
respectable
member
of
the
party
am
one

myself
one
said
mortimer
up
an
awful
staircase
commanding
a
and
i
have
a
whole
clerk
to
myself
and
he
has
nothing
to
do
but
look
at
the
and
what
he
will
turn
out
when
arrived
at
maturity
i
can
not
conceive
whether
in
that
shabby
rook
nest
he
is
always
plotting
wisdom
or
plotting
murder
whether
he
will
grow
up
after
so
much
solitary
brooding
to
enlighten
his
or
to
poison
them
is
the
only
speck
of
interest
that
presents
itself
to
my
professional
view
will
you

thank
you

it

i
show

said
eugene
and
it
is
likely
enough
that
ten
thousand
other
young
men
within
the
limits
of
the
london
town
delivery
made
the
same
hopeful
remark
in
the
course
of
the
same
evening
the
wheels
rolled
on
and
rolled
down
by
the
monument
and
by
the
tower
and
by
the
docks
down
by
ratcliffe
and
by
rotherhithe
down
by
where
accumulated
scum
of
humanity
seemed
to
be
washed
from
higher
grounds
like
so
much
moral
sewage
and
to
be
pausing
until
its
own
weight
forced
it
over
the
bank
and
sunk
it
in
the
river
in
and
out
among
vessels
that
seemed
to
have
got
ashore
and
houses
that
seemed
to
have
got
afloat
among
staring
into
windows
and
windows
staring
into
ships
the
wheels
rolled
on
until
they
stopped
at
a
dark
corner
and
otherwise
not
washed
at
all
where
the
boy
alighted
and
opened
the
door
must
walk
the
rest
sir
it
not
many
yards
he
spoke
in
the
singular
number
to
the
express
exclusion
of
eugene
is
a
confoundedly
place
said
mortimer
slipping
over
the
stones
and
refuse
on
the
shore
as
the
boy
turned
the
corner
sharp
my
father
sir
where
the
light
is
the
low
building
had
the
look
of
having
once
been
a
mill
there
was
a
rotten
wart
of
wood
upon
its
forehead
that
seemed
to
indicate
where
the
sails
had
been
but
the
whole
was
very
indistinctly
seen
in
the
obscurity
of
the
night
the
boy
lifted
the
latch
of
the
door
and
they
passed
at
once
into
a
low
circular
room
where
a
man
stood
before
a
red
fire
looking
down
into
it
and
a
girl
sat
engaged
in
needlework
the
fire
was
in
a
rusty
brazier
not
fitted
to
the
hearth
and
a
common
lamp
shaped
like
a
smoked
and
flared
in
the
neck
of
a
stone
bottle
on
the
table
there
was
a
wooden
bunk
or
berth
in
a
corner
and
in
another
corner
a
wooden
stair
leading
above
so
clumsy
and
steep
that
it
was
little
better
than
a
ladder
two
or
three
old
sculls
and
oars
stood
against
the
wall
and
against
another
part
of
the
wall
was

the
two
friends
read
the

as
it
stuck
against
the

and

read
them
as
he
held
the
light

on
the
unfortunate

said
lightwood
glancing
from

of

moving

to

and
here
moving
the

to
another
pocket

empty
and
turned
inside
out
and
so
was
this
one
and
so
was
that
one
i
ca
read
nor
i
do
want
to
it
for
i
know
by
their
places
on
the

anchors
and
a

and
last
time
in

pretty
well
papers
the

you
see

i

all
i
scholar
enough
he
waved
the
light
over
the
whole
as
if
to
typify
the
light
of
his
scholarly
intelligence
and
then
put
it
down
on
the
table
and
stood
behind
it
looking
intently
at
his
visitors
he
had
the
special
peculiarity
of
some
birds
of
prey
that
when
he
knitted
his
brow
his
ruffled
crest
stood
highest
did
not
find
all
these
yourself
did
you
asked
eugene
to
which
the
bird
of
prey
slowly
rejoined
what
might
your
name
be
now
is
my
friend
mortimer
lightwood
interposed
eugene
wrayburn
eugene
wrayburn
is
it
and
what
might
mr
eugene
wrayburn
have
asked
of
me
asked
you
simply
if
you
found
all
these
yourself
answer
you
simply
most
on
you
suppose
there
has
been
much
violence
and
robbery
beforehand
among
these
cases
do
suppose
at
all
about
it
returned
gaffer
ai
one
of
the
supposing
sort
if
you
got
your
living
to
haul
out
of
the
river
every
day
of
your
life
you
might
be
much
given
to
supposing
am
i
to
show
the
way
as
he
opened
the
door
in
pursuance
of
a
nod
from
lightwood
an
extremely
pale
and
disturbed
face
appeared
in
the
doorway
the
face
of
a
man
much
agitated
body
missing
asked
gaffer
hexam
stopping
short
a
body
found
which
am
lost
replied
the
man
in
a
hurried
and
an
eager
manner
i
am
a
stranger
and
do
know
the
way
i
i
want
to
find
the
place
where
i
can
see
what
is
described
here
it
is
possible
i
may
know
it
he
was
panting
and
could
hardly
speak
but
he
showed
a
copy
of
the
bill
that
was
still
wet
upon
the
wall
perhaps
its
newness
or
perhaps
the
accuracy
of
his
observation
of
its
general
look
guided
gaffer
to
a
ready
conclusion
gentleman
mr
lightwood
is
on
that
business
lightwood
during
a
pause
mortimer
and
the
stranger
confronted
each
other
neither
knew
the
other
think
sir
said
mortimer
breaking
the
awkward
silence
with
his
airy
you
did
me
the
honour
to
mention
my
name
repeated
it
after
this
man
said
you
were
a
stranger
in
london
utter
stranger
you
seeking
a
mr
harmon
i
believe
i
can
assure
you
that
you
are
on
a
fruitless
errand
and
will
not
find
what
you
fear
to
find
will
you
come
with
us
a
little
winding
through
some
muddy
alleys
that
might
have
been
deposited
by
the
last
tide
brought
them
to
the
and
bright
lamp
of
a
police
station
where
they
found
the
with
a
pen
and
ink
and
ruler
posting
up
his
books
in
a
whitewashed
office
as
studiously
as
if
he
were
in
a
monastery
on
top
of
a
mountain
and
no
howling
fury
of
a
drunken
woman
were
banging
herself
against
a
in
the
at
his
elbow
with
the
same
air
of
a
recluse
much
given
to
study
he
desisted
from
his
books
to
bestow
a
distrustful
nod
of
recognition
upon
gaffer
plainly
importing
we
know
all
about
you
and
you
overdo
it
some
day
and
to
inform
mr
mortimer
lightwood
and
friends
that
he
would
attend
them
immediately
then
he
finished
ruling
the
work
he
had
in
hand
it
might
have
been
illuminating
a
missal
he
was
so
calm
in
a
very
neat
and
methodical
manner
showing
not
the
slightest
consciousness
of
the
woman
who
was
banging
herself
with
increased
violence
and
shrieking
most
terrifically
for
some
other
woman
liver
said
the
taking
up
his
keys
which
a
deferential
satellite
produced
gentlemen
with
one
of
his
keys
he
opened
a
cool
grot
at
the
end
of
the
yard
and
they
all
went
in
they
quickly
came
out
again
no
one
speaking
but
eugene
who
remarked
to
mortimer
in
a
whisper
much
worse
than
lady
tippins
so
back
to
the
whitewashed
library
of
the
monastery
with
that
liver
still
in
shrieking
requisition
as
it
had
been
loudly
while
they
looked
at
the
silent
sight
they
came
to
see
and
there
through
the
merits
of
the
case
as
summed
up
by
the
abbot
no
clue
to
how
body
came
into
river
very
often
was
no
clue
too
late
to
know
for
certain
whether
injuries
received
before
or
after
death
one
excellent
surgical
opinion
said

other
excellent

after
steward
of

in
which
gentleman
came
home
passenger
had
been
round
to
view
and
could
swear
to
identity
likewise
could
swear
to
clothes
and
then
you
see
you
had
the
papers
too
how
was
it
he
had
totally
disappeared
on
leaving

found
in
river
well
probably
had
been
upon
some
little
game
probably
thought
it
a
harmless
game

up
to
things
and
it
turned
out
a
fatal
game
inquest
and
no
doubt
open
verdict
appears
to
have
knocked
your
friend
over
knocked
him
completely
off
his
legs
mr
inspector
remarked
when
he
had
finished
his
summing
up
has
given
him
a
bad
turn
to
be
sure
this
was
said
in
a
very
low
voice
and
with
a
searching
look
not
the
first
he
had
cast
at
the
stranger
mr
lightwood
explained
that
it
was
no
friend
of
his
said
mr
inspector
with
an
attentive
ear
did
you
pick
him
up
mr
lightwood
explained
further
mr
inspector
had
delivered
his
summing
up
and
had
added
these
words
with
his
elbows
leaning
on
his
desk
and
the
fingers
and
thumb
of
his
right
hand
fitting
themselves
to
the
fingers
and
thumb
of
his
left
mr
inspector
moved
nothing
but
his
eyes
as
he
now
added
raising
his
voice
you
faint
sir
seems
you
not
accustomed
to
this
kind
of
work
the
stranger
who
was
leaning
against
the
chimneypiece
with
drooping
head
looked
round
and
answered
it
a
horrible
sight
expected
to
identify
i
am
told
sir
you
identified
it
a
horrible
sight
o
a
horrible
horrible
sight
did
you
think
it
might
have
been
asked
mr
inspector
us
a
description
sir
perhaps
we
can
help
you
no
said
the
stranger
would
be
quite
useless
mr
inspector
had
not
moved
and
had
given
no
order
but
the
satellite
slipped
his
back
against
the
wicket
and
laid
his
left
arm
along
the
top
of
it
and
with
his
right
hand
turned
the
he
had
taken
from
his
chief
in
quite
a
casual
manner
towards
the
stranger
missed
a
friend
you
know
or
you
missed
a
foe
you
know
or
you
would
have
come
here
you
know
well
then
ai
it
reasonable
to
ask
who
was
it
thus
mr
inspector
must
excuse
my
telling
you
no
class
of
man
can
understand
better
than
you
that
families
may
not
choose
to
publish
their
disagreements
and
misfortunes
except
on
the
last
necessity
i
do
not
dispute
that
you
discharge
your
duty
in
asking
me
the
question
you
will
not
dispute
my
right
to
withhold
the
answer
again
he
turned
towards
the
wicket
where
the
satellite
with
his
eye
upon
his
chief
remained
a
dumb
statue
least
said
mr
inspector
will
not
object
to
leave
me
your
card
sir
should
not
object
if
i
had
one
but
i
have
not
he
reddened
and
was
much
confused
as
he
gave
the
answer
least
said
mr
inspector
with
no
change
of
voice
or
manner
will
not
object
to
write
down
your
name
and
address
at
all
mr
inspector
dipped
a
pen
in
his
inkstand
and
deftly
laid
it
on
a
piece
of
paper
close
beside
him
then
resumed
his
former
attitude
the
stranger
stepped
up
to
the
desk
and
wrote
in
a
rather
tremulous
hand
mr
inspector
taking
sidelong
note
of
every
hair
of
his
head
when
it
was
bent
down
for
the
purpose
julius

palace
yard
westminster
there
i
presume
sir
there
from
the
country
yes
from
the
country
sir
the
satellite
removed
his
arm
and
opened
the
wicket
and
mr
julius
handford
went
out
said
mr
inspector
care
of
this
piece
of
paper
keep
him
in
view
without
giving
offence
ascertain
that
he
is
staying
there
and
find
out
anything
you
can
about
him
the
satellite
was
gone
and
mr
inspector
becoming
once
again
the
quiet
abbot
of
that
monastery
dipped
his
pen
in
his
ink
and
resumed
his
books
the
two
friends
who
had
watched
him
more
amused
by
the
professional
manner
than
suspicious
of
mr
julius
handford
inquired
before
taking
their
departure
too
whether
he
believed
there
was
anything
that
really
looked
bad
here
the
abbot
replied
with
reticence
could
say
if
a
murder
anybody
might
have
done
it
burglary
or
wanted
not
so
murder
we
were
all
of
us
up
to
that
had
seen
scores
of
people
come
to
identify
and
never
saw
one
person
struck
in
that
particular
way
might
however
have
been
stomach
and
not
mind
if
so
rum
stomach
but
to
be
sure
there
were
rum
everythings
pity
there
was
not
a
word
of
truth
in
that
superstition
about
bodies
bleeding
when
touched
by
the
hand
of
the
right
person
you
never
got
a
sign
out
of
bodies
you
got
row
enough
out
of
such
as
her
she
was
good
for
all
night
now
referring
here
to
the
banging
demands
for
the
liver
you
got
nothing
out
of
bodies
if
it
was
ever
so
there
being
nothing
more
to
be
done
until
the
inquest
was
held
next
day
the
friends
went
away
together
and
gaffer
hexam
and
his
son
went
their
separate
way
but
arriving
at
the
last
corner
gaffer
bade
his
boy
go
home
while
he
turned
into
a
tavern
that
stood
dropsically
bulging
over
the
causeway
a
the
boy
lifted
the
latch
he
had
lifted
before
and
found
his
sister
again
seated
before
the
fire
at
her
work
who
raised
her
head
upon
his
coming
in
and
asking
did
you
go
liz
went
out
in
the
dark
was
no
necessity
for
that
it
was
all
right
enough
of
the
gentlemen
the
one
who
did
speak
while
i
was
there
looked
hard
at
me
and
i
was
afraid
he
might
know
what
my
face
meant
but
there
do
mind
me
charley
i
was
all
in
a
tremble
of
another
sort
when
you
owned
to
father
you
could
write
a
little
but
i
made
believe
i
wrote
so
badly
as
that
it
was
odds
if
any
one
could
read
it
and
when
i
wrote
slowest
and
smeared
but
with
my
finger
most
father
was
best
pleased
as
he
stood
looking
over
me
the
girl
put
aside
her
work
and
drawing
her
seat
close
to
his
seat
by
the
fire
laid
her
arm
gently
on
his
shoulder
make
the
most
of
your
time
charley
wo
you
i
come
i
like
that
do
i
charley
yes
you
work
hard
at
your
learning
i
know
and
i
work
a
little
charley
and
plan
and
contrive
a
little
wake
out
of
my
sleep
contriving
sometimes
how
to
get
together
a
shilling
now
and
a
shilling
then
that
shall
make
father
believe
you
are
beginning
to
earn
a
stray
living
along
shore

father
favourite
and
can
make
him
believe
anything

i
could
charley
for
if
i
could
make
him
believe
that
learning
was
a
good
thing
and
that
we
might
lead
better
lives
i
should
be
content
to
die
talk
stuff
about
dying
liz
she
placed
her
hands
in
one
another
on
his
shoulder
and
laying
her
rich
brown
cheek
against
them
as
she
looked
down
at
the
fire
went
on
thoughtfully
an
evening
charley
when
you
are
at
the
school
and
father
the
six
jolly
fellowship
porters
the
boy
struck
in
with
a
backward
nod
of
his
head
towards
the
then
as
i
sit
at
the
fire
i
seem
to
see
in
the
burning
coal
like
where
that
glow
is
now
gas
that
is
said
the
boy
out
of
a
bit
of
a
forest
that
been
under
the
mud
that
was
under
the
water
in
the
days
of
ark
look
here
when
i
take
the
poker
so
and
give
it
a
dig
disturb
it
charley
or
it
be
all
in
a
blaze
it
that
dull
glow
near
it
coming
and
going
that
i
mean
when
i
look
at
it
of
an
evening
it
comes
like
pictures
to
me
charley
us
a
picture
said
the
boy
us
where
to
look
it
wants
my
eyes
charley
away
then
and
tell
us
what
your
eyes
make
of
it
there
are
you
and
me
charley
when
you
were
quite
a
baby
that
never
knew
a
mother
go
saying
i
never
knew
a
mother
interposed
the
boy
i
knew
a
little
sister
that
was
sister
and
mother
both
the
girl
laughed
delightedly
and
her
eyes
filled
with
pleasant
tears
as
he
put
both
his
arms
round
her
waist
and
so
held
her
are
you
and
me
charley
when
father
was
away
at
work
and
locked
us
out
for
fear
we
should
set
ourselves
afire
or
fall
out
of
window
sitting
on
the
sitting
on
other
sitting
on
the
bank
of
the
river
wandering
about
to
get
through
the
time
you
are
rather
heavy
to
carry
charley
and
i
am
often
obliged
to
rest
sometimes
we
are
sleepy
and
fall
asleep
together
in
a
corner
sometimes
we
are
very
hungry
sometimes
we
are
a
little
frightened
but
what
is
oftenest
hard
upon
us
is
the
cold
you
remember
charley
remember
said
the
boy
pressing
her
to
him
twice
or
thrice
i
snuggled
under
a
little
shawl
and
it
was
warm
there
it
rains
and
we
creep
under
a
boat
or
the
like
of
that
sometimes
it
dark
and
we
get
among
the
gaslights
sitting
watching
the
people
as
they
go
along
the
streets
at
last
up
comes
father
and
takes
us
home
and
home
seems
such
a
shelter
after
out
of
doors
and
father
pulls
my
shoes
off
and
dries
my
feet
at
the
fire
and
has
me
to
sit
by
him
while
he
smokes
his
pipe
long
after
you
are
abed
and
i
notice
that
father
is
a
large
hand
but
never
a
heavy
one
when
it
touches
me
and
that
father
is
a
rough
voice
but
never
an
angry
one
when
it
speaks
to
me
so
i
grow
up
and
little
by
little
father
trusts
me
and
makes
me
his
companion
and
let
him
be
put
out
as
he
may
never
once
strikes
me
the
listening
boy
gave
a
grunt
here
as
much
as
to
say
he
strikes
me
though
are
some
of
the
pictures
of
what
is
past
charley
away
again
said
the
boy
give
us
a
one
a
future
one
there
am
i
continuing
with
father
and
holding
to
father
because
father
loves
me
and
i
love
father
i
ca
so
much
as
read
a
book
because
if
i
had
learned
father
would
have
thought
i
was
deserting
him
and
i
should
have
lost
my
influence
i
have
not
the
influence
i
want
to
have
i
can
not
stop
some
dreadful
things
i
try
to
stop
but
i
go
on
in
the
hope
and
trust
that
the
time
will
come
in
the
meanwhile
i
know
that
i
am
in
some
things
a
stay
to
father
and
that
if
i
was
not
faithful
to
him
he
would
in
or
in
disappointment
or
both
go
wild
and
bad
us
a
touch
of
the
pictures
about
me
was
passing
on
to
them
charley
said
the
girl
who
had
not
changed
her
attitude
since
she
began
and
who
now
mournfully
shook
her
head
others
were
all
leading
up
there
are
you
am
i
liz
in
the
hollow
down
by
the
flare
seems
to
be
the
in
the
hollow
down
by
the
flare
said
the
boy
glancing
from
her
eyes
to
the
brazier
which
had
a
grisly
skeleton
look
on
its
long
thin
legs
are
you
charley
working
your
way
in
secret
from
father
at
the
school
and
you
get
prizes
and
you
go
on
better
and
better
and
you
come
to
be
a
what
was
it
you
called
it
when
you
told
me
about
that
ha
not
know
the
name
cried
the
boy
seeming
to
be
rather
relieved
by
this
default
on
the
part
of
the
hollow
down
by
the
flare
come
to
be
a
and
you
still
go
on
better
and
better
and
you
rise
to
be
a
master
full
of
learning
and
respect
but
the
secret
has
come
to
father
knowledge
long
before
and
it
has
divided
you
from
father
and
from
me
it
has
it
has
charley
i
see
as
plain
as
plain
can
be
that
your
way
is
not
ours
and
that
even
if
father
could
be
got
to
forgive
your
taking
it
which
he
never
could
be
that
way
of
yours
would
be
darkened
by
our
way
but
i
see
too
charley
as
plain
as
plain
can
be
liz
asked
the
boy
playfully
still
that
it
is
a
great
work
to
have
cut
you
away
from
life
and
to
have
made
a
new
and
good
beginning
so
there
am
i
charley
left
alone
with
father
keeping
him
as
straight
as
i
can
watching
for
more
influence
than
i
have
and
hoping
that
through
some
fortunate
chance
or
when
he
is
ill
or
when
i
do
know
what
i
may
turn
him
to
wish
to
do
better
things
said
you
could
read
a
book
lizzie
your
library
of
books
is
the
hollow
down
by
the
flare
i
think
should
be
very
glad
to
be
able
to
read
real
books
i
feel
my
want
of
learning
very
much
charley
but
i
should
feel
it
much
more
if
i
know
it
to
be
a
tie
between
me
and
hark
father
tread
it
being
now
past
midnight
the
bird
of
prey
went
straight
to
roost
at
following
he
reappeared
at
the
six
jolly
fellowship
porters
in
the
character
not
new
to
him
of
a
witness
before
a
coroner
jury
mr
mortimer
lightwood
besides
sustaining
the
character
of
one
of
the
witnesses
doubled
the
part
with
that
of
the
eminent
solicitor
who
watched
the
proceedings
on
behalf
of
the
representatives
of
the
deceased
as
was
duly
recorded
in
the
newspapers
mr
inspector
watched
the
proceedings
too
and
kept
his
watching
closely
to
himself
mr
julius
handford
having
given
his
right
address
and
being
reported
in
solvent
circumstances
as
to
his
bill
though
nothing
more
was
known
of
him
at
his
hotel
except
that
his
way
of
life
was
very
retired
had
no
summons
to
appear
and
was
merely
present
in
the
shades
of
mr
inspector
mind
the
case
was
made
interesting
to
the
public
by
mr
mortimer
evidence
touching
the
circumstances
under
which
the
deceased
mr
john
harmon
had
returned
to
england
exclusive
private
proprietorship
in
which
circumstances
was
set
up
at
for
several
days
by
veneering
twemlow
podsnap
and
all
the
buffers
who
all
related
them
irreconcilably
with
one
another
and
contradicted
themselves
it
was
also
made
interesting
by
the
testimony
of
job
potterson
the
steward
and
one
mr
jacob
kibble
a
that
the
deceased
mr
john
harmon
did
bring
over
in
a
with
which
he
did
disembark
the
sum
realized
by
the
forced
sale
of
his
little
landed
property
and
that
the
sum
exceeded
in
ready
money
seven
hundred
pounds
it
was
further
made
interesting
by
the
remarkable
experiences
of
jesse
hexam
in
having
rescued
from
the
thames
so
many
dead
bodies
and
for
whose
behoof
a
rapturous
admirer
subscribing
himself
friend
to
burial
perhaps
an
undertaker
sent
eighteen
postage
stamps
and
five
sir
to
the
editor
of
the
times
upon
the
evidence
adduced
before
them
the
jury
found
that
the
body
of
mr
john
harmon
had
been
discovered
floating
in
the
thames
in
an
advanced
state
of
decay
and
much
injured
and
that
the
said
mr
john
harmon
had
come
by
his
death
under
highly
suspicious
circumstances
though
by
whose
act
or
in
what
precise
manner
there
was
no
evidence
before
this
jury
to
show
and
they
appended
to
their
verdict
a
recommendation
to
the
home
office
which
mr
inspector
appeared
to
think
highly
sensible
to
offer
a
reward
for
the
solution
of
the
mystery
within
hours
a
reward
of
one
hundred
pounds
was
proclaimed
together
with
a
free
pardon
to
any
person
or
persons
not
the
actual
perpetrator
or
perpetrators
and
so
forth
in
due
form
this
proclamation
rendered
mr
inspector
additionally
studious
and
caused
him
to
stand
meditating
on
and
causeways
and
to
go
lurking
about
in
boats
putting
this
and
that
together
but
according
to
the
success
with
which
you
put
this
and
that
together
you
get
a
woman
and
a
fish
apart
or
a
mermaid
in
combination
and
mr
inspector
could
turn
out
nothing
better
than
a
mermaid
which
no
judge
and
jury
would
believe
in
thus
like
the
tides
on
which
it
had
been
borne
to
the
knowledge
of
men
the
harmon
murder
as
it
came
to
be
popularly
called
went
up
and
down
and
ebbed
and
flowed
now
in
the
town
now
in
the
country
now
among
palaces
now
among
hovels
now
among
lords
and
ladies
and
gentlefolks
now
among
labourers
and
hammerers
and
until
at
last
after
a
long
interval
of
slack
water
it
got
out
to
sea
and
drifted
away
chapter
the
wilfer
family
reginald
wilfer
is
a
name
with
rather
a
grand
sound
suggesting
on
first
acquaintance
brasses
in
country
churches
scrolls
in
windows
and
generally
the
de
wilfers
who
came
over
with
the
conqueror
for
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
in
genealogy
that
no
de
any
ones
ever
came
over
with
anybody
else
but
the
reginald
wilfer
family
were
of
such
commonplace
extraction
and
pursuits
that
their
forefathers
had
for
generations
modestly
subsisted
on
the
docks
the
excise
office
and
the
custom
house
and
the
existing
wilfer
was
a
poor
clerk
so
poor
a
clerk
though
having
a
limited
salary
and
an
unlimited
family
that
he
had
never
yet
attained
the
modest
object
of
his
ambition
which
was
to
wear
a
complete
new
suit
of
clothes
hat
and
boots
included
at
one
time
his
black
hat
was
brown
before
he
could
afford
a
coat
his
pantaloons
were
white
at
the
seams
and
knees
before
he
could
buy
a
pair
of
boots
his
boots
had
worn
out
before
he
could
treat
himself
to
new
pantaloons
and
by
the
time
he
worked
round
to
the
hat
again
that
shining
modern
article
an
ancient
ruin
of
various
periods
if
the
conventional
cherub
could
ever
grow
up
and
be
clothed
he
might
be
photographed
as
a
portrait
of
wilfer
his
chubby
smooth
innocent
appearance
was
a
reason
for
his
being
always
treated
with
condescension
when
he
was
not
put
down
a
stranger
entering
his
own
poor
house
at
about
ten
might
have
been
surprised
to
find
him
sitting
up
to
supper
so
boyish
was
he
in
his
curves
and
proportions
that
his
old
schoolmaster
meeting
him
in
cheapside
might
have
been
unable
to
withstand
the
temptation
of
caning
him
on
the
spot
in
short
he
was
the
conventional
cherub
after
the
supposititious
shoot
just
mentioned
rather
grey
with
signs
of
care
on
his
expression
and
in
decidedly
insolvent
circumstances
he
was
shy
and
unwilling
to
own
to
the
name
of
reginald
as
being
too
aspiring
and
a
name
in
his
signature
he
used
only
the
initial
and
imparted
what
it
really
stood
for
to
none
but
chosen
friends
under
the
seal
of
confidence
out
of
this
the
facetious
habit
had
arisen
in
the
neighbourhood
surrounding
mincing
lane
of
making
christian
names
for
him
of
adjectives
and
participles
beginning
with
some
of
these
were
more
or
less
appropriate
as
rusty
retiring
ruddy
round
ripe
ridiculous
ruminative
others
derived
their
point
from
their
want
of
application
as
raging
rattling
roaring
raffish
but
his
popular
name
was
rumty
which
in
a
moment
of
inspiration
had
been
bestowed
upon
him
by
a
gentleman
of
convivial
habits
connected
with
the
as
the
beginning
of
a
social
chorus
his
leading
part
in
the
execution
of
which
had
led
this
gentleman
to
the
temple
of
fame
and
of
which
the
whole
expressive
burden
ran
iddity
row
dow
dow
sing
toodlely
teedlely
bow
wow
wow
thus
he
was
constantly
addressed
even
in
minor
notes
on
business
as
rumty
in
answer
to
which
he
sedately
signed
himself
truly
r
wilfer
he
was
clerk
in
the
of
chicksey
veneering
and
stobbles
chicksey
and
stobbles
his
former
masters
had
both
become
absorbed
in
veneering
once
their
traveller
or
commission
agent
who
had
signalized
his
accession
to
supreme
power
by
bringing
into
the
business
a
quantity
of
window
and
mahogany
partition
and
a
gleaming
and
enormous
doorplate
wilfer
locked
up
his
desk
one
evening
and
putting
his
bunch
of
keys
in
his
pocket
much
as
if
it
were
his
made
for
home
his
home
was
in
the
holloway
region
north
of
london
and
then
divided
from
it
by
fields
and
trees
between
battle
bridge
and
that
part
of
the
holloway
district
in
which
he
dwelt
was
a
tract
of
suburban
sahara
where
tiles
and
bricks
were
burnt
bones
were
boiled
carpets
were
beat
rubbish
was
shot
dogs
were
fought
and
dust
was
heaped
by
contractors
skirting
the
border
of
this
desert
by
the
way
he
took
when
the
light
of
its
made
lurid
smears
on
the
fog
wilfer
sighed
and
shook
his
head
me
said
he
might
have
been
is
not
what
is
with
which
commentary
on
human
life
indicating
an
experience
of
it
not
exclusively
his
own
he
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
end
of
his
journey
mrs
wilfer
was
of
course
a
tall
woman
and
an
angular
her
lord
being
cherubic
she
was
necessarily
majestic
according
to
the
principle
which
matrimonially
unites
contrasts
she
was
much
given
to
tying
up
her
head
in
a
knotted
under
the
chin
this
in
conjunction
with
a
pair
of
gloves
worn
within
doors
she
seemed
to
consider
as
at
once
a
kind
of
armour
against
misfortune
invariably
assuming
it
when
in
low
spirits
or
difficulties
and
as
a
species
of
full
dress
it
was
therefore
with
some
sinking
of
the
spirit
that
her
husband
beheld
her
thus
heroically
attired
putting
down
her
candle
in
the
little
hall
and
coming
down
the
doorsteps
through
the
little
front
court
to
open
the
gate
for
him
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
for
wilfer
stopped
on
the
steps
staring
at
it
and
cried
said
mrs
wilfer
man
came
himself
with
a
pair
of
pincers
and
took
it
off
and
took
it
away
he
said
that
as
he
had
no
expectation
of
ever
being
paid
for
it
and
as
he
had
an
order
for
another
school
it
was
better
burnished
up
for
the
interests
of
all
parties
it
was
my
dear
what
do
you
think
are
master
here
returned
his
wife
is
as
you
think
not
as
i
do
perhaps
it
might
have
been
better
if
the
man
had
taken
the
door
too
dear
we
could
have
done
without
the
door
we
my
dear
could
we
is
as
you
think
not
as
i
do
with
those
submissive
words
the
dutiful
wife
preceded
him
down
a
few
stairs
to
a
little
basement
front
room
half
kitchen
half
parlour
where
a
girl
of
about
nineteen
with
an
exceedingly
pretty
figure
and
face
but
with
an
impatient
and
petulant
expression
both
in
her
face
and
in
her
shoulders
which
in
her
sex
and
at
her
age
are
very
expressive
of
discontent
sat
playing
draughts
with
a
younger
girl
who
was
the
youngest
of
the
house
of
wilfer
not
to
encumber
this
page
by
telling
off
the
wilfers
in
detail
and
casting
them
up
in
the
gross
it
is
enough
for
the
present
that
the
rest
were
what
is
called
in
the
world
in
various
ways
and
that
they
were
many
so
many
that
when
one
of
his
dutiful
children
called
in
to
see
him
wilfer
generally
seemed
to
say
to
himself
after
a
little
mental
arithmetic
here
another
of
before
adding
aloud
de
do
john
or
susan
as
the
case
might
be
piggywiggies
said
de
do
what
i
was
thinking
of
my
dear
to
mrs
wilfer
already
seated
in
a
corner
with
folded
gloves
that
as
we
have
let
our
first
floor
so
well
and
as
we
have
now
no
place
in
which
you
could
teach
pupils
even
if
pupils
milkman
said
he
knew
of
two
young
ladies
of
the
highest
respectability
who
were
in
search
of
a
suitable
establishment
and
he
took
a
card
interposed
mrs
wilfer
with
severe
monotony
as
if
she
were
reading
an
act
of
parliament
aloud
your
father
whether
it
was
last
monday
bella
we
never
heard
any
more
of
it
ma
said
bella
the
elder
girl
addition
to
which
my
dear
her
husband
urged
you
have
no
place
to
put
two
young
persons
into
me
mrs
wilfer
again
interposed
were
not
young
persons
two
young
ladies
of
the
highest
respectability
tell
your
father
bella
whether
the
milkman
said
so
dear
it
is
the
same
thing
it
is
not
said
mrs
wilfer
with
the
same
impressive
monotony
me
mean
my
dear
it
is
the
same
thing
as
to
space
as
to
space
if
you
have
no
space
in
which
to
put
two
youthful
however
eminently
respectable
which
i
do
not
doubt
where
are
those
youthful
to
be
accommodated
i
carry
it
no
further
than
that
and
solely
looking
at
it
said
her
husband
making
the
stipulation
at
once
in
a
conciliatory
complimentary
and
argumentative
tone
i
am
sure
you
will
agree
my
love
from
a
point
of
view
my
dear
have
nothing
more
to
say
returned
mrs
wilfer
with
a
meek
renunciatory
action
of
her
gloves
is
as
you
think
not
as
i
do
here
the
huffing
of
miss
bella
and
the
loss
of
three
of
her
men
at
a
swoop
aggravated
by
the
coronation
of
an
opponent
led
to
that
young
lady
jerking
the
and
pieces
off
the
table
which
her
sister
went
down
on
her
knees
to
pick
up
bella
said
mrs
wilfer
poor
lavinia
perhaps
my
dear
suggested
me
said
mrs
wilfer
it
was
one
of
the
worthy
woman
specialities
that
she
had
an
amazing
power
of
gratifying
her
splenetic
or
humours
by
extolling
her
own
family
which
she
thus
proceeded
in
the
present
case
to
do
lavinia
has
not
known
the
trial
that
bella
has
known
the
trial
that
your
daughter
bella
has
undergone
is
perhaps
without
a
parallel
and
has
been
borne
i
will
say
nobly
when
you
see
your
daughter
bella
in
her
black
dress
which
she
alone
of
all
the
family
wears
and
when
you
remember
the
circumstances
which
have
led
to
her
wearing
it
and
when
you
know
how
those
circumstances
have
been
sustained
then
lay
your
head
upon
your
pillow
and
say
poor
lavinia
here
miss
lavinia
from
her
kneeling
situation
under
the
table
put
in
that
she
did
want
to
be
by
pa
or
anybody
else
am
sure
you
do
not
my
dear
returned
her
mother
you
have
a
fine
brave
spirit
and
your
sister
cecilia
has
a
fine
brave
spirit
of
another
kind
a
spirit
of
pure
devotion
a
spirit
the
of
cecilia
reveals
a
pure
and
womanly
character
very
seldom
equalled
never
surpassed
i
have
now
in
my
pocket
a
letter
from
your
sister
cecilia
received
this
morning
received
three
months
after
her
marriage
poor
child
in
which
she
tells
me
that
her
husband
must
unexpectedly
shelter
under
their
roof
his
reduced
aunt
but
i
will
be
true
to
him
mamma
she
touchingly
writes
i
will
not
leave
him
i
must
not
forget
that
he
is
my
husband
let
his
aunt
come
if
this
is
not
pathetic
if
this
is
not
woman
devotion
the
good
lady
waved
her
gloves
in
a
sense
of
the
impossibility
of
saying
more
and
tied
the
over
her
head
in
a
tighter
knot
under
her
chin
bella
who
was
now
seated
on
the
rug
to
warm
herself
with
her
brown
eyes
on
the
fire
and
a
handful
of
her
brown
curls
in
her
mouth
laughed
at
this
and
then
pouted
and
half
cried
am
sure
said
she
you
have
no
feeling
for
me
pa
i
am
one
of
the
most
unfortunate
girls
that
ever
lived
you
know
how
poor
we
it
is
probable
he
did
having
some
reason
to
know
it
what
a
glimpse
of
wealth
i
had
and
how
it
melted
away
and
how
i
am
here
in
this
ridiculous
mourning
which
i
hate
a
kind
of
a
widow
who
never
was
married
and
yet
you
do
feel
for
yes
you
do
yes
you
do
this
abrupt
change
was
occasioned
by
her
father
face
she
stopped
to
pull
him
down
from
his
chair
in
an
attitude
highly
favourable
to
strangulation
and
to
give
him
a
kiss
and
a
pat
or
two
on
the
cheek
you
ought
to
feel
for
me
you
know
dear
i
do
and
i
say
you
ought
to
if
they
had
only
left
me
alone
and
told
me
nothing
about
it
it
would
have
mattered
much
less
but
that
nasty
mr
lightwood
feels
it
his
duty
as
he
says
to
write
and
tell
me
what
is
in
reserve
for
me
and
then
i
am
obliged
to
get
rid
of
george
sampson
here
lavinia
rising
to
the
surface
with
the
last
draughtman
rescued
interposed
never
cared
for
george
sampson
bella
did
i
say
i
did
miss
then
pouting
again
with
the
curls
in
her
mouth
sampson
was
very
fond
of
me
and
admired
me
very
much
and
put
up
with
everything
i
did
to
him
were
rude
enough
to
him
lavinia
again
interposed
did
i
say
i
was
miss
i
am
not
setting
up
to
be
sentimental
about
george
sampson
i
only
say
george
sampson
was
better
than
nothing
did
show
him
that
you
thought
even
that
lavinia
again
interposed
are
a
chit
and
a
little
idiot
returned
bella
you
make
such
a
dolly
speech
what
did
you
expect
me
to
do
wait
till
you
are
a
woman
and
do
talk
about
what
you
do
understand
you
only
show
your
ignorance
then
whimpering
again
and
at
intervals
biting
the
curls
and
stopping
to
look
how
much
was
bitten
off
a
shame
there
never
was
such
a
hard
case
i
should
care
so
much
if
it
so
ridiculous
it
was
ridiculous
enough
to
have
a
stranger
coming
over
to
marry
me
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
it
was
ridiculous
enough
to
know
what
an
embarrassing
meeting
it
would
be
and
how
we
never
could
pretend
to
have
an
inclination
of
our
own
either
of
us
it
was
ridiculous
enough
to
know
i
should
like
him
how
could
i
like
him
left
to
him
in
a
will
like
a
dozen
of
spoons
with
everything
cut
and
dried
beforehand
like
orange
chips
talk
of
orange
flowers
indeed
i
declare
again
it
a
shame
those
ridiculous
points
would
have
been
smoothed
away
by
the
money
for
i
love
money
and
want
money
want
it
dreadfully
i
hate
to
be
poor
and
we
are
degradingly
poor
offensively
poor
miserably
poor
beastly
poor
but
here
i
am
left
with
all
the
ridiculous
parts
of
the
situation
remaining
and
added
to
them
all
this
ridiculous
dress
and
if
the
truth
was
known
when
the
harmon
murder
was
all
over
the
town
and
people
were
speculating
on
its
being
suicide
i
dare
say
those
impudent
wretches
at
the
clubs
and
places
made
jokes
about
the
miserable
creature
having
preferred
a
watery
grave
to
me
it
likely
enough
they
took
such
liberties
i
should
wonder
i
declare
it
a
very
hard
case
indeed
and
i
am
a
most
unfortunate
girl
the
idea
of
being
a
kind
of
a
widow
and
never
having
been
married
and
the
idea
of
being
as
poor
as
ever
after
all
and
going
into
black
besides
for
a
man
i
never
saw
and
should
have
hated
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
if
i
had
seen
the
young
lady
lamentations
were
checked
at
this
point
by
a
knuckle
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
room
the
knuckle
had
knocked
two
or
three
times
already
but
had
not
been
heard
is
it
said
mrs
wilfer
in
her
manner
a
gentleman
coming
in
miss
bella
with
a
short
and
sharp
exclamation
scrambled
off
the
and
massed
the
bitten
curls
together
in
their
right
place
on
her
neck
servant
girl
had
her
key
in
the
door
as
i
came
up
and
directed
me
to
this
room
telling
me
i
was
expected
i
am
afraid
i
should
have
asked
her
to
announce
me
me
returned
mrs
wilfer
at
all
two
of
my
daughters
this
is
the
gentleman
who
has
taken
your
he
was
so
good
as
to
make
an
appointment
for
when
you
would
be
at
home
a
dark
gentleman
thirty
at
the
utmost
an
expressive
one
might
say
handsome
face
a
very
bad
manner
in
the
last
degree
constrained
reserved
diffident
troubled
his
eyes
were
on
miss
bella
for
an
instant
and
then
looked
at
the
ground
as
he
addressed
the
master
of
the
house
that
i
am
quite
satisfied
mr
wilfer
with
the
rooms
and
with
their
situation
and
with
their
price
i
suppose
a
memorandum
between
us
of
two
or
three
lines
and
a
payment
down
will
bind
the
bargain
i
wish
to
send
in
furniture
without
delay
two
or
three
times
during
this
short
address
the
cherub
addressed
had
made
chubby
motions
towards
a
chair
the
gentleman
now
took
it
laying
a
hesitating
hand
on
a
corner
of
the
table
and
with
another
hesitating
hand
lifting
the
crown
of
his
hat
to
his
lips
and
drawing
it
before
his
mouth
gentleman
said
mrs
wilfer
to
take
your
apartments
by
the
quarter
a
quarter
notice
on
either
side
i
mention
sir
insinuated
the
landlord
expecting
it
to
be
received
as
a
matter
of
course
form
of
a
reference
think
returned
the
gentleman
after
a
pause
a
reference
is
not
necessary
neither
to
say
the
truth
is
it
convenient
for
i
am
a
stranger
in
london
i
require
no
reference
from
you
and
perhaps
therefore
you
will
require
none
from
me
that
will
be
fair
on
both
sides
indeed
i
show
the
greater
confidence
of
the
two
for
i
will
pay
in
advance
whatever
you
please
and
i
am
going
to
trust
my
furniture
here
whereas
if
you
were
in
embarrassed
circumstances
this
is
merely
supposititious
conscience
causing
wilfer
to
colour
mrs
wilfer
from
a
corner
she
always
got
into
stately
corners
came
to
the
rescue
with
a
why
then
i
might
lose
it
observed
wilfer
cheerfully
and
goods
are
certainly
the
best
of
references
you
think
they
are
the
best
pa
asked
miss
bella
in
a
low
voice
and
without
looking
over
her
shoulder
as
she
warmed
her
foot
on
the
fender
the
best
my
dear
should
have
thought
myself
it
was
so
easy
to
add
the
usual
kind
of
one
said
bella
with
a
toss
of
her
curls
the
gentleman
listened
to
her
with
a
face
of
marked
attention
though
he
neither
looked
up
nor
changed
his
attitude
he
sat
still
and
silent
until
his
future
landlord
accepted
his
proposals
and
brought
writing
materials
to
complete
the
business
he
sat
still
and
silent
while
the
landlord
wrote
when
the
agreement
was
ready
in
duplicate
the
landlord
having
worked
at
it
like
some
cherubic
scribe
in
what
is
conventionally
called
a
doubtful
which
means
a
not
at
all
doubtful
old
master
it
was
signed
by
the
contracting
parties
bella
looking
on
as
scornful
witness
the
contracting
parties
were
wilfer
and
john
rokesmith
esquire
when
it
came
to
bella
turn
to
sign
her
name
mr
rokesmith
who
was
standing
as
he
had
sat
with
a
hesitating
hand
upon
the
table
looked
at
her
stealthily
but
narrowly
he
looked
at
the
pretty
figure
bending
down
over
the
paper
and
saying
am
i
to
go
pa
here
in
this
corner
he
looked
at
the
beautiful
brown
hair
shading
the
coquettish
face
he
looked
at
the
free
dash
of
the
signature
which
was
a
bold
one
for
a
woman
and
then
they
looked
at
one
another
obliged
to
you
miss
wilfer
have
given
you
so
much
trouble
my
name
yes
certainly
but
i
am
your
landlord
daughter
sir
as
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
but
pay
eight
sovereigns
in
earnest
of
the
bargain
pocket
the
agreement
appoint
a
time
for
the
arrival
of
his
furniture
and
himself
and
go
mr
rokesmith
did
that
as
awkwardly
as
it
might
be
done
and
was
escorted
by
his
landlord
to
the
outer
air
when
wilfer
returned
candlestick
in
hand
to
the
bosom
of
his
family
he
found
the
bosom
agitated
said
bella
have
got
a
murderer
for
a
tenant
said
lavinia
have
got
a
robber
see
him
unable
for
his
life
to
look
anybody
in
the
face
said
bella
never
was
such
an
exhibition
dears
said
their
father
is
a
diffident
gentleman
and
i
should
say
particularly
so
in
the
society
of
girls
of
your
age
our
age
cried
bella
impatiently
that
got
to
do
with
him
we
are
not
of
the
same
age
which
age
demanded
lavinia
you
mind
lavvy
retorted
bella
wait
till
you
are
of
an
age
to
ask
such
questions
pa
mark
my
words
between
mr
rokesmith
and
me
there
is
a
natural
antipathy
and
a
deep
distrust
and
something
will
come
of
it
dear
and
girls
said
the
mr
rokesmith
and
me
there
is
a
matter
of
eight
sovereigns
and
something
for
supper
shall
come
of
it
if
you
agree
upon
the
article
this
was
a
neat
and
happy
turn
to
give
the
subject
treats
being
rare
in
the
wilfer
household
where
a
monotonous
appearance
of
at
ten
in
the
evening
had
been
rather
frequently
commented
on
by
the
dimpled
shoulders
of
miss
bella
indeed
the
modest
dutchman
himself
seemed
conscious
of
his
want
of
variety
and
generally
came
before
the
family
in
a
state
of
apologetic
perspiration
after
some
discussion
on
the
relative
merits
of
sweetbread
and
lobster
a
decision
was
pronounced
in
favour
of
mrs
wilfer
then
solemnly
divested
herself
of
her
handkerchief
and
gloves
as
a
preliminary
sacrifice
to
preparing
the
and
himself
went
out
to
purchase
the
viand
he
soon
returned
bearing
the
same
in
a
fresh
where
it
coyly
embraced
a
rasher
of
ham
melodious
sounds
were
not
long
in
rising
from
the
on
the
fire
or
in
seeming
as
the
firelight
danced
in
the
mellow
halls
of
a
couple
of
full
bottles
on
the
table
to
play
appropriate
the
cloth
was
laid
by
lavvy
bella
as
the
acknowledged
ornament
of
the
family
employed
both
her
hands
in
giving
her
hair
an
additional
wave
while
sitting
in
the
easiest
chair
and
occasionally
threw
in
a
direction
touching
the
supper
as
brown
ma
or
to
her
sister
the
saltcellar
straight
miss
and
do
be
a
dowdy
little
puss
meantime
her
father
chinking
mr
rokesmith
gold
as
he
sat
expectant
between
his
knife
and
fork
remarked
that
six
of
those
sovereigns
came
just
in
time
for
their
landlord
and
stood
them
in
a
little
pile
on
the
white
tablecloth
to
look
at
hate
our
landlord
said
bella
but
observing
a
fall
in
her
father
face
she
went
and
sat
down
by
him
at
the
table
and
began
touching
up
his
hair
with
the
handle
of
a
fork
it
was
one
of
the
girl
spoilt
ways
to
be
always
arranging
the
hair
perhaps
because
her
own
was
so
pretty
and
occupied
so
much
of
her
attention
deserve
to
have
a
house
of
your
own
do
you
poor
pa
do
deserve
it
better
than
another
my
dear
any
rate
i
for
one
want
it
more
than
another
said
bella
holding
him
by
the
chin
as
she
stuck
his
flaxen
hair
on
end
i
grudge
this
money
going
to
the
monster
that
swallows
up
so
much
when
we
all
want
everything
and
if
you
say
as
you
want
to
say
i
know
you
want
to
say
so
pa
that
neither
reasonable
nor
honest
bella
then
i
answer
maybe
not
pa
very
likely
but
it
one
of
the
consequences
of
being
poor
and
of
thoroughly
hating
and
detesting
to
be
poor
and
that
my
now
you
look
lovely
pa
why
do
you
always
wear
your
hair
like
that
and
here
the
cutlet
if
it
is
very
brown
ma
i
ca
eat
it
and
must
have
a
bit
put
back
to
be
done
expressly
however
as
it
was
brown
even
to
bella
taste
the
young
lady
graciously
partook
of
it
without
reconsignment
to
the
and
also
in
due
course
of
the
contents
of
the
two
bottles
whereof
one
held
scotch
ale
and
the
other
rum
the
latter
perfume
with
the
fostering
aid
of
boiling
water
and
diffused
itself
throughout
the
room
and
became
so
highly
concentrated
around
the
warm
fireside
that
the
wind
passing
over
the
house
roof
must
have
rushed
off
charged
with
a
delicious
whiff
of
it
after
buzzing
like
a
great
bee
at
that
particular
chimneypot
said
bella
sipping
the
fragrant
mixture
and
warming
her
favourite
ankle
old
mr
harmon
made
such
a
fool
of
me
not
to
mention
himself
as
he
is
dead
what
do
you
suppose
he
did
it
for
to
say
my
dear
as
i
have
told
you
time
out
of
number
since
his
will
was
brought
to
light
i
doubt
if
i
ever
exchanged
a
hundred
words
with
the
old
gentleman
if
it
was
his
whim
to
surprise
us
his
whim
succeeded
for
he
certainly
did
it
i
was
stamping
my
foot
and
screaming
when
he
first
took
notice
of
me
was
i
said
bella
contemplating
the
ankle
before
mentioned
were
stamping
your
little
foot
my
dear
and
screaming
with
your
little
voice
and
laying
into
me
with
your
little
bonnet
which
you
had
snatched
off
for
the
purpose
returned
her
father
as
if
the
remembrance
gave
a
relish
to
the
rum
were
doing
this
one
sunday
morning
when
i
took
you
out
because
i
did
go
the
exact
way
you
wanted
when
the
old
gentleman
sitting
on
a
seat
near
said
that
a
nice
girl
that
a
very
nice
girl
a
promising
girl
and
so
you
were
my
dear
then
he
asked
my
name
did
he
pa
he
asked
your
name
my
dear
and
mine
and
on
other
sunday
mornings
when
we
walked
his
way
we
saw
him
again
and
and
really
that
all
as
that
was
all
the
rum
and
water
too
or
in
other
words
as
delicately
signified
that
his
glass
was
empty
by
throwing
back
his
head
and
standing
the
glass
upside
down
on
his
nose
and
upper
lip
it
might
have
been
charitable
in
mrs
wilfer
to
suggest
replenishment
but
that
heroine
briefly
suggesting
instead
the
bottles
were
put
away
and
the
family
retired
she
cherubically
escorted
like
some
severe
saint
in
a
painting
or
merely
human
matron
allegorically
treated
by
this
time
said
lavinia
when
the
two
girls
were
alone
in
their
room
shall
have
mr
rokesmith
here
and
shall
be
expecting
to
have
our
throats
cut
need
stand
between
me
and
the
candle
for
all
that
retorted
bella
is
another
of
the
consequences
of
being
poor
the
idea
of
a
girl
with
a
really
fine
head
of
hair
having
to
do
it
by
one
flat
candle
and
a
few
inches
of
caught
george

with
it

bad
as
your
means
of
dressing

are

thing

talk
about
catching
people

till
your
own
time
for
catching
as
you
call
it

it
has
come
muttered
lavvy
with
a
toss
of
her
head
did
you
say
asked
bella
very
sharply
did
you
say
miss
lavvy
declining
equally
to
repeat
or
to
explain
bella
gradually
lapsed
over
her
into
a
soliloquy
on
the
miseries
of
being
poor
as
exemplified
in
having
nothing
to
put
on
nothing
to
go
out
in
nothing
to
dress
by
only
a
nasty
box
to
dress
at
instead
of
a
commodious
and
being
obliged
to
take
in
suspicious
lodgers
on
the
last
grievance
as
her
climax
she
laid
great
stress
and
might
have
laid
greater
had
she
known
that
if
mr
julius
handford
had
a
twin
brother
upon
earth
mr
john
rokesmith
was
the
man
chapter
boffin
bower
over
against
a
london
house
a
corner
house
not
far
from
cavendish
square
a
man
with
a
wooden
leg
had
sat
for
some
years
with
his
remaining
foot
in
a
basket
in
cold
weather
picking
up
a
living
on
this
wise
every
morning
at
eight
he
stumped
to
the
corner
carrying
a
chair
a
a
pair
of
trestles
a
board
a
basket
and
an
umbrella
all
strapped
together
separating
these
the
board
and
trestles
became
a
counter
the
basket
supplied
the
few
small
lots
of
fruit
and
sweets
that
he
offered
for
sale
upon
it
and
became
a
the
unfolded
displayed
a
choice
collection
of
halfpenny
ballads
and
became
a
screen
and
the
stool
planted
within
it
became
his
post
for
the
rest
of
the
day
all
weathers
saw
the
man
at
the
post
this
is
to
be
accepted
in
a
double
sense
for
he
contrived
a
back
to
his
wooden
stool
by
placing
it
against
the
when
the
weather
was
wet
he
put
up
his
umbrella
over
his
stock
in
trade
not
over
himself
when
the
weather
was
dry
he
furled
that
faded
article
tied
it
round
with
a
piece
of
yarn
and
laid
it
under
the
trestles
where
it
looked
like
an
lettuce
that
had
lost
in
colour
and
crispness
what
it
had
gained
in
size
he
had
established
his
right
to
the
corner
by
imperceptible
prescription
he
had
never
varied
his
ground
an
inch
but
had
in
the
beginning
diffidently
taken
the
corner
upon
which
the
side
of
the
house
gave
a
howling
corner
in
the
winter
time
a
dusty
corner
in
the
summer
time
an
undesirable
corner
at
the
best
of
times
shelterless
fragments
of
straw
and
paper
got
up
revolving
storms
there
when
the
main
street
was
at
peace
and
the
as
if
it
were
drunk
or
came
blundering
and
jolting
round
it
making
it
muddy
when
all
else
was
clean
on
the
front
of
his
hung
a
little
placard
like
a
bearing
the
inscription
in
his
own
small
text
errands
gone
on
with
fi
delity
by
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
remain
your
humble
servt
silas
wegg
he
had
not
only
settled
it
with
himself
in
course
of
time
that
he
was
by
appointment
to
the
house
at
the
corner
though
he
received
such
commissions
not
half
a
dozen
times
in
a
year
and
then
only
as
some
servant
deputy
but
also
that
he
was
one
of
the
retainers
and
owed
vassalage
to
it
and
was
bound
to
leal
and
loyal
interest
in
it
for
this
reason
he
always
spoke
of
it
as
house
and
though
his
knowledge
of
its
affairs
was
mostly
speculative
and
all
wrong
claimed
to
be
in
its
confidence
on
similar
grounds
he
never
beheld
an
inmate
at
any
one
of
its
windows
but
he
touched
his
hat
yet
he
knew
so
little
about
the
inmates
that
he
gave
them
names
of
his
own
invention
as
elizabeth
george
jane
parker
having
no
authority
whatever
for
any
such
designations
but
particularly
the
last
to
which
as
a
natural
consequence
he
stuck
with
great
obstinacy
over
the
house
itself
he
exercised
the
same
imaginary
power
as
over
its
inhabitants
and
their
affairs
he
had
never
been
in
it
the
length
of
a
piece
of
fat
black
which
trailed
itself
over
the
into
a
damp
stone
passage
and
had
rather
the
air
of
a
leech
on
the
house
that
had
wonderfully
but
this
was
no
impediment
to
his
arranging
it
according
to
a
plan
of
his
own
it
was
a
great
dingy
house
with
a
quantity
of
dim
side
window
and
blank
back
premises
and
it
cost
his
mind
a
world
of
trouble
so
to
lay
it
out
as
to
account
for
everything
in
its
external
appearance
but
this
once
done
was
quite
satisfactory
and
he
rested
persuaded
that
he
knew
his
way
about
the
house
blindfold
from
the
barred
garrets
in
the
high
roof
to
the
two
iron
extinguishers
before
the
main
door
which
seemed
to
request
all
lively
visitors
to
have
the
kindness
to
put
themselves
out
before
entering
assuredly
this
stall
of
silas
wegg
was
the
hardest
little
stall
of
all
the
sterile
little
stalls
in
london
it
gave
you
the
to
look
at
his
apples
the
to
look
at
his
oranges
the
to
look
at
his
nuts
of
the
latter
commodity
he
had
always
a
grim
little
heap
on
which
lay
a
little
wooden
measure
which
had
no
discernible
inside
and
was
considered
to
represent
the
appointed
by
magna
charta
whether
from
too
much
east
wind
or
no
it
was
an
easterly
corner
the
stall
the
stock
and
the
keeper
were
all
as
dry
as
the
desert
wegg
was
a
knotty
man
and
a
with
a
face
carved
out
of
very
hard
material
that
had
just
as
much
play
of
expression
as
a
watchman
rattle
when
he
laughed
certain
jerks
occurred
in
it
and
the
rattle
sprung
sooth
to
say
he
was
so
wooden
a
man
that
he
seemed
to
have
taken
his
wooden
leg
naturally
and
rather
suggested
to
the
fanciful
observer
that
he
might
be
expected
if
his
development
received
no
untimely
check
to
be
completely
set
up
with
a
pair
of
wooden
legs
in
about
six
months
mr
wegg
was
an
observant
person
or
as
he
himself
said
a
powerful
sight
of
notice
he
saluted
all
his
regular
every
day
as
he
sat
on
his
stool
backed
up
by
the
and
on
the
adaptable
character
of
these
salutes
he
greatly
plumed
himself
thus
to
the
rector
he
addressed
a
bow
compounded
of
lay
deference
and
a
slight
touch
of
the
shady
preliminary
meditation
at
church
to
the
doctor
a
confidential
bow
as
to
a
gentleman
whose
acquaintance
with
his
inside
he
begged
respectfully
to
acknowledge
before
the
quality
he
delighted
to
abase
himself
and
for
uncle
parker
who
was
in
the
army
at
least
so
he
had
settled
it
he
put
his
open
hand
to
the
side
of
his
hat
in
a
military
manner
which
that
old
gentleman
appeared
but
imperfectly
to
appreciate
the
only
article
in
which
silas
dealt
that
was
not
hard
was
gingerbread
on
a
certain
day
some
wretched
infant
having
purchased
the
damp
fearfully
out
of
condition
and
the
adhesive
which
had
been
exposed
for
the
day
sale
he
had
taken
a
tin
box
from
under
his
stool
to
produce
a
relay
of
those
dreadful
specimens
and
was
going
to
look
in
at
the
lid
when
he
said
to
himself
pausing
here
you
are
again
the
words
referred
to
a
broad
old
fellow
in
mourning
coming
comically
ambling
towards
the
corner
dressed
in
a
pea
and
carrying
a
large
stick
he
wore
thick
shoes
and
thick
leather
gaiters
and
thick
gloves
like
a
hedger
both
as
to
his
dress
and
to
himself
he
was
of
an
overlapping
rhinoceros
build
with
folds
in
his
cheeks
and
his
forehead
and
his
eyelids
and
his
lips
and
his
ears
but
with
bright
eager
grey
eyes
under
his
ragged
eyebrows
and
hat
a
very
old
fellow
altogether
you
are
again
repeated
mr
wegg
musing
what
are
you
now
are
you
in
the
funns
or
where
are
you
have
you
lately
come
to
settle
in
this
neighbourhood
or
do
you
own
to
another
neighbourhood
are
you
in
independent
circumstances
or
is
it
wasting
the
motions
of
a
bow
on
you
come
i
speculate
i
invest
a
bow
in
you
which
mr
wegg
having
replaced
his
tin
box
accordingly
did
as
he
rose
to
bait
his
for
some
other
devoted
infant
the
salute
was
acknowledged
with
sir
morning
morning
me
sir
said
mr
wegg
to
himself
wo
answer
a
bow
gone
morning
morning
to
be
rather
a
old
cock
too
said
mr
wegg
as
before
morning
to
you
sir
you
remember
me
then
asked
his
new
acquaintance
stopping
in
his
amble
before
the
stall
and
speaking
in
a
pounding
way
though
with
great
have
noticed
you
go
past
our
house
sir
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
last
week
or
so
house
repeated
the
other
said
mr
wegg
nodding
as
the
other
pointed
the
clumsy
forefinger
of
his
right
glove
at
the
corner
house
now
what
pursued
the
old
fellow
in
an
inquisitive
manner
carrying
his
knotted
stick
in
his
left
arm
as
if
it
were
a
baby
do
they
allow
you
now
job
work
that
i
do
for
our
house
returned
silas
drily
and
with
reticence
not
yet
brought
to
an
exact
allowance
it
not
yet
brought
to
an
exact
allowance
no
it
not
yet
brought
to
an
exact
allowance
oh
morning
morning
morning
to
be
rather
a
cracked
old
cock
thought
silas
qualifying
his
former
good
opinion
as
the
other
ambled
off
but
in
a
moment
he
was
back
again
with
the
question
did
you
get
your
wooden
leg
mr
wegg
replied
tartly
to
this
personal
inquiry
an
accident
you
like
it
i
have
got
to
keep
it
warm
mr
wegg
made
answer
in
a
sort
of
desperation
occasioned
by
the
singularity
of
the
question
has
repeated
the
other
to
his
knotted
stick
as
he
gave
it
a
hug
has
got
ha
ha
to
keep
it
warm
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
name
of
boffin
said
mr
wegg
who
was
growing
restive
under
this
examination
never
did
hear
of
the
name
of
boffin
you
like
it
no
retorted
mr
wegg
again
approaching
desperation
ca
say
i
do
do
you
like
it
do
know
why
i
do
retorted
mr
wegg
approaching
frenzy
i
do
at
all
i
tell
you
something
that
make
you
sorry
for
that
said
the
stranger
smiling
name
boffin
ca
help
it
returned
mr
wegg
implying
in
his
manner
the
offensive
addition
if
i
could
i
would
there
another
chance
for
you
said
mr
boffin
smiling
still
you
like
the
name
of
nicodemus
think
it
over
nick
or
noddy
is
not
sir
mr
wegg
rejoined
as
he
sat
down
on
his
stool
with
an
air
of
gentle
resignation
combined
with
melancholy
candour
is
not
a
name
as
i
could
wish
any
one
that
i
had
a
respect
for
to
call
me
by
but
there
may
be
persons
that
would
not
view
it
with
the
same
i
do
know
why
mr
wegg
added
anticipating
another
question
boffin
said
that
gentleman
that
my
name
noddy
or
nick
boffin
what
your
name
i
do
said
mr
wegg
bestirring
himself
to
take
the
same
precaution
as
before
do
know
why
silas
and
i
do
know
why
wegg
wegg
said
mr
boffin
hugging
his
stick
closer
want
to
make
a
sort
of
offer
to
you
do
you
remember
when
you
first
see
me
the
wooden
wegg
looked
at
him
with
a
meditative
eye
and
also
with
a
softened
air
as
descrying
possibility
of
profit
me
think
i
quite
sure
and
yet
i
generally
take
a
powerful
sight
of
notice
too
was
it
on
a
monday
morning
when
the
had
been
to
our
house
for
orders
and
bought
a
ballad
of
me
which
being
unacquainted
with
the
tune
i
run
it
over
to
him
wegg
right
but
he
bought
more
than
one
to
be
sure
sir
he
bought
several
and
wishing
to
lay
out
his
money
to
the
best
he
took
my
opinion
to
guide
his
choice
and
we
went
over
the
collection
together
to
be
sure
we
did
here
was
him
as
it
might
be
and
here
was
myself
as
it
might
be
and
there
was
you
mr
boffin
as
you
identically
are
with
your
stick
under
your
very
same
arm
and
your
very
same
back
towards
us
to
be
sure
added
mr
wegg
looking
a
little
round
mr
boffin
to
take
him
in
the
rear
and
identify
this
last
extraordinary
coincidence
wery
back
do
you
think
i
was
doing
wegg
should
judge
sir
that
you
might
be
glancing
your
eye
down
the
street
wegg
i
was
a
listening
you
indeed
said
mr
wegg
dubiously
in
a
dishonourable
way
wegg
because
you
was
singing
to
the
butcher
and
you
would
sing
secrets
to
a
butcher
in
the
street
you
know
never
happened
that
i
did
so
yet
to
the
best
of
my
remembrance
said
mr
wegg
cautiously
i
might
do
it
a
man
ca
say
what
he
might
wish
to
do
some
day
or
another
this
not
to
release
any
little
advantage
he
might
derive
from
mr
boffin
avowal
repeated
boffin
was
a
listening
to
you
and
to
him
and
what
do
you
you
have
got
another
stool
have
you
i
rather
thick
in
my
breath
have
got
another
but
you
welcome
to
this
said
wegg
resigning
it
a
treat
to
me
to
stand
exclaimed
mr
boffin
in
a
tone
of
great
enjoyment
as
he
settled
himself
down
still
nursing
his
stick
like
a
baby
a
pleasant
place
this
and
then
to
be
shut
in
on
each
side
with
these
ballads
like
so
many
blinkers
why
its
delightful
i
am
not
mistaken
sir
mr
wegg
delicately
hinted
resting
a
hand
on
his
stall
and
bending
over
the
discursive
boffin
alluded
to
some
offer
or
another
that
was
in
your
mind
coming
to
it
all
right
i
coming
to
it
i
was
going
to
say
that
when
i
listened
that
morning
i
listened
with
hadmiration
amounting
to
haw
i
thought
to
myself
here
a
man
with
a
wooden
leg
a
literary
man
with
not
exactly
so
sir
said
mr
wegg
you
know
every
one
of
these
songs
by
name
and
by
tune
and
if
you
want
to
read
or
to
sing
any
one
on
off
straight
you
only
to
whip
on
your
spectacles
and
do
it
cried
mr
boffin

you
at
it
sir
returned
mr
wegg
with
a
conscious
inclination
of
the
head
say
literary
then
a
literary
man
with
a
wooden
leg
and
all
print
is
open
to
him
that
what
i
thought
to
myself
that
morning
pursued
mr
boffin
leaning
forward
to
describe
uncramped
by
the
clotheshorse
as
large
an
arc
as
his
right
arm
could
make
all
print
is
open
to
him
and
it
is
ai
it
truly
sir
mr
wegg
admitted
with
modesty
believe
you
could
show
me
the
piece
of
english
print
that
i
would
be
equal
to
collaring
and
throwing
the
spot
said
mr
boffin
the
spot
know
it
then
consider
this
here
am
i
a
man
without
a
wooden
leg
and
yet
all
print
is
shut
to
me
sir
mr
wegg
returned
with
increasing
neglected
lected
repeated
boffin
with
emphasis
ai
no
word
for
it
i
do
mean
to
say
but
what
if
you
showed
me
a
b
i
could
so
far
give
you
change
for
it
as
to
answer
boffin
come
sir
said
mr
wegg
throwing
in
a
little
encouragement
something
too
something
answered
mr
boffin
i
take
my
oath
it
much
it
not
as
much
as
could
be
wished
by
an
inquiring
mind
sir
mr
wegg
admitted
look
here
i
retired
from
business

and
mrs
boffin

her
father

was
henery
and

and

live
on
a
compittance
under
the
will
of
a
diseased
governor
dead
sir
alive

i
tell
you

diseased
governor

too
late
for
me
to
begin
shovelling
and
sifting
at
alphabeds
and
i
getting
to
be
a
old
bird
and
i
want
to
take

easy
but
i
want
some
reading
some
fine

splendid
book

gorging
of
wollumes

meaning
gorgeous

by
association
of
ideas

right
down
your
pint
of
view
and
take
time
to
go
by
you
how
can
i
get
that
reading
wegg
by
tapping
him
on
the
breast
with
the
head
of
his
thick
stick
a
man
truly
qualified
to
do
it
so
much
an
hour
say
twopence
to
come
and
do
it
flattered
sir
i
am
sure
said
wegg
beginning
to
regard
himself
in
quite
a
new
light
this
is
the
offer
you
mentioned
sir
do
you
like
it
am
considering
of
it
mr
boffin
do
said
boffin
in
a
manner
to
tie
a
literary
man
with
a
wooden
leg
down
too
tight
a
halfpenny
an
hour
sha
part
us
the
hours

to
choose
after

for
the
day
with

out
holloway
direction
and
you
only

go
when
finished
here
and
you
there
twopence
halfpenny
an
hour
said
boffin
taking
a
piece
of
chalk
from
his
pocket
and
getting
off
the
stool
to
work
the
sum
on
the
top
of
it
in
his
own
way
and
a
twopence
halfpenny
two
is
a
and
two
two
is
four
making
five
six
nights
a
week
at
five
a
night
scoring
them
all
down
separately
you
mount
up
to
thirty
a
half
a
crown
pointing
to
this
result
as
a
large
and
satisfactory
one
mr
boffin
smeared
it
out
with
his
moistened
glove
and
sat
down
on
the
remains
a
crown
said
wegg
meditating
it
ai
much
sir
half
a
crown
week
you
know
week
yes
as
to
the
amount
of
strain
upon
the
intellect
now
was
you
thinking
at
all
of
poetry
mr
wegg
inquired
musing
it
come
dearer
mr
boffin
asked
would
come
dearer
mr
wegg
returned
when
a
person
comes
to
grind
off
poetry
night
after
night
it
is
but
right
he
should
expect
to
be
paid
for
its
weakening
effect
on
his
mind
tell
you
the
truth
wegg
said
boffin
was
thinking
of
poetry
except
in
so
fur
as
this
if
you
was
to
happen
now
and
then
to
feel
yourself
in
the
mind
to
tip
me
and
mrs
boffin
one
of
your
ballads
why
then
we
should
drop
into
poetry
follow
you
sir
said
wegg
not
being
a
regular
musical
professional
i
should
be
loath
to
engage
myself
for
that
and
therefore
when
i
dropped
into
poetry
i
should
ask
to
be
considered
so
fur
in
the
light
of
a
friend
at
this
mr
boffin
eyes
sparkled
and
he
shook
silas
earnestly
by
the
hand
protesting
that
it
was
more
than
he
could
have
asked
and
that
he
took
it
very
kindly
indeed
do
you
think
of
the
terms
wegg
mr
boffin
then
demanded
with
unconcealed
anxiety
silas
who
had
stimulated
this
anxiety
by
his
hard
reserve
of
manner
and
who
had
begun
to
understand
his
man
very
well
replied
with
an
air
as
if
he
were
saying
something
extraordinarily
generous
and
great
boffin
i
never
bargain
i
should
have
thought
of
you
said
mr
boffin
admiringly
sir
i
never
did
and
i
never
will
consequently
i
meet
you
at
once
free
and
fair
with
done
for
double
the
money
mr
boffin
seemed
a
little
unprepared
for
this
conclusion
but
assented
with
the
remark
know
better
what
it
ought
to
be
than
i
do
wegg
and
again
shook
hands
with
him
upon
it
you
begin
to
night
wegg
he
then
demanded
sir
said
mr
wegg
careful
to
leave
all
the
eagerness
to
him
see
no
difficulty
if
you
wish
it
you
are
provided
with
the
needful
implement
a
book
sir
him
at
a
sale
said
mr
boffin
wollumes
red
and
gold
purple
ribbon
in
every
wollume
to
keep
the
place
where
you
leave
off
do
you
know
him
book
name
sir
inquired
silas
thought
you
might
have
know
him
without
it
said
mr
boffin
slightly
disappointed
name
is
mr
boffin
went
over
these
stones
slowly
and
with
much
caution
indeed
said
mr
wegg
nodding
his
head
with
an
air
of
friendly
recognition
know
him
wegg
have
been
not
to
say
right
slap
through
him
very
lately
mr
wegg
made
answer
been
otherways
employed
mr
boffin
but
know
him
old
familiar
declining
and
falling
off
the
rooshan
rather
sir
ever
since
i
was
not
so
high
as
your
stick
ever
since
my
eldest
brother
left
our
cottage
to
enlist
into
the
army
on
which
occasion
as
the
ballad
that
was
made
about
it
describes
that
cottage
door
mr
boffin
a
girl
was
on
her
knees
she
held
aloft
a
snowy
scarf
sir
which
my
eldest
brother
noticed
fluttered
in
the
breeze
she
breathed
a
prayer
for
him
mr
boffin
a
prayer
he
coold
not
hear
and
my
eldest
brother
lean
upon
his
sword
mr
boffin
and
wiped
away
a
tear
much
impressed
by
this
family
circumstance
and
also
by
the
friendly
disposition
of
mr
wegg
as
exemplified
in
his
so
soon
dropping
into
poetry
mr
boffin
again
shook
hands
with
that
ligneous
sharper
and
besought
him
to
name
his
hour
mr
wegg
named
eight
i
live
said
mr
boffin
called
the
bower
boffin
bower
is
the
name
mrs
boffin
christened
it
when
we
come
into
it
as
a
property
if
you
should
meet
with
anybody
that
do
know
it
by
that
name
which
hardly
anybody
does
when
you
got
nigh
upon
about
a
odd
mile
or
say
and
a
quarter
if
you
like
up
maiden
lane
battle
bridge
ask
for
harmony
jail
and
you
be
put
right
i
shall
expect
you
wegg
said
mr
boffin
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
with
the
greatest
enthusiasm
joyfully
i
shall
have
no
peace
or
patience
till
you
come
print
is
now
opening
ahead
of
me
this
night
a
literary
man
with
a
wooden
leg
he
bestowed
an
admiring
look
upon
that
decoration
as
if
it
greatly
enhanced
the
relish
of
mr
wegg
attainments
begin
to
lead
me
a
new
life
my
fist
again
wegg
morning
morning
morning
left
alone
at
his
stall
as
the
other
ambled
off
mr
wegg
subsided
into
his
screen
produced
a
small
of
a
character
and
took
himself
by
the
nose
with
a
thoughtful
aspect
also
while
he
still
grasped
that
feature
he
directed
several
thoughtful
looks
down
the
street
after
the
retiring
figure
of
mr
boffin
but
profound
gravity
sat
enthroned
on
countenance
for
while
he
considered
within
himself
that
this
was
an
old
fellow
of
rare
simplicity
that
this
was
an
opportunity
to
be
improved
and
that
here
might
be
money
to
be
got
beyond
present
calculation
still
he
compromised
himself
by
no
admission
that
his
new
engagement
was
at
all
out
of
his
way
or
involved
the
least
element
of
the
ridiculous
mr
wegg
would
even
have
picked
a
handsome
quarrel
with
any
one
who
should
have
challenged
his
deep
acquaintance
with
those
aforesaid
eight
volumes
of
decline
and
fall
his
gravity
was
unusual
portentous
and
immeasurable
not
because
he
admitted
any
doubt
of
himself
but
because
he
perceived
it
necessary
to
forestall
any
doubt
of
himself
in
others
and
herein
he
ranged
with
that
very
numerous
class
of
impostors
who
are
quite
as
determined
to
keep
up
appearances
to
themselves
as
to
their
neighbours
a
certain
loftiness
likewise
took
possession
of
mr
wegg
a
condescending
sense
of
being
in
request
as
an
official
expounder
of
mysteries
it
did
not
move
him
to
commercial
greatness
but
rather
to
littleness
insomuch
that
if
it
had
been
within
the
possibilities
of
things
for
the
wooden
measure
to
hold
fewer
nuts
than
usual
it
would
have
done
so
that
day
but
when
night
came
and
with
her
veiled
eyes
beheld
him
stumping
towards
boffin
bower
he
was
elated
too
the
bower
was
as
difficult
to
find
as
fair
rosamond
without
the
clue
mr
wegg
having
reached
the
quarter
indicated
inquired
for
the
bower
half
a
dozen
times
without
the
least
success
until
he
remembered
to
ask
for
harmony
jail
this
occasioned
a
quick
change
in
the
spirits
of
a
hoarse
gentleman
and
a
donkey
whom
he
had
much
perplexed
yer
mean
old
harmon
do
yer
said
the
hoarse
gentleman
who
was
driving
his
donkey
in
a
truck
with
a
carrot
for
a
whip
did
yer
niver
say
so
eddard
and
me
is
a
goin
by
him
jump
in
mr
wegg
complied
and
the
hoarse
gentleman
invited
his
attention
to
the
third
person
in
company
thus
you
look
at
eddard
ears
what
was
it
as
you
named
agin
whisper
mr
wegg
whispered
bower
keep
yer
hi
on
his
ears
cut
away
to
boffin
bower
edward
with
his
ears
lying
back
remained
immoveable
keep
yer
hi
on
his
ears
cut
away
to
old
harmon
edward
instantly
pricked
up
his
ears
to
their
utmost
and
rattled
off
at
such
a
pace
that
mr
wegg
conversation
was
jolted
out
of
him
in
a
most
dislocated
state
asked
mr
wegg
holding
on
a
proper
jail
wot
you
and
me
would
get
committed
to
returned
his
escort
giv
it
the
name
on
accounts
of
old
harmon
living
solitary
there
asked
wegg
accounts
of
his
never
agreeing
with
nobody
like
a
speeches
of
chaff
harmon
jail
harmony
jail
working
it
round
like
asked
wegg
should
think
so
everybody
do
about
here
eddard
knows
him
keep
yer
hi
on
his
ears
noddy
boffin
eddard
the
effect
of
the
name
was
so
very
alarming
in
respect
of
causing
a
temporary
disappearance
of
edward
head
casting
his
hind
hoofs
in
the
air
greatly
accelerating
the
pace
and
increasing
the
jolting
that
mr
wegg
was
fain
to
devote
his
attention
exclusively
to
holding
on
and
to
relinquish
his
desire
of
ascertaining
whether
this
homage
to
boffin
was
to
be
considered
complimentary
or
the
reverse
presently
edward
stopped
at
a
gateway
and
wegg
discreetly
lost
no
time
in
slipping
out
at
the
back
of
the
truck
the
moment
he
was
landed
his
late
driver
with
a
wave
of
the
carrot
said
eddard
and
he
the
hind
hoofs
the
truck
and
edward
all
seemed
to
fly
into
the
air
together
in
a
kind
of
apotheosis
pushing
the
gate
which
stood
ajar
wegg
looked
into
an
enclosed
space
where
certain
tall
dark
mounds
rose
high
against
the
sky
and
where
the
pathway
to
the
bower
was
indicated
as
the
moonlight
showed
between
two
lines
of
broken
crockery
set
in
ashes
a
white
figure
advancing
along
this
path
proved
to
be
nothing
more
ghostly
than
mr
boffin
easily
attired
for
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
in
an
undress
garment
of
short
white
having
received
his
literary
friend
with
great
cordiality
he
conducted
him
to
the
interior
of
the
bower
and
there
presented
him
to
mrs
boffin
a
stout
lady
of
a
rubicund
and
cheerful
aspect
dressed
to
mr
wegg
consternation
in
a
low
of
sable
satin
and
a
large
black
velvet
hat
and
feathers
boffin
wegg
said
boffin
a
highflyer
at
fashion
and
her
make
is
such
that
she
does
it
credit
as
to
myself
i
ai
yet
as
as
i
may
come
to
be
henerietty
old
lady
this
is
the
gentleman
that
a
going
to
decline
and
fall
off
the
rooshan
empire
i
am
sure
i
hope
it
do
you
both
good
said
mrs
boffin
it
was
the
queerest
of
rooms
fitted
and
furnished
more
like
a
luxurious
amateur
than
anything
else
within
the
ken
of
silas
wegg
there
were
two
wooden
settles
by
the
fire
one
on
either
side
of
it
with
a
corresponding
table
before
each
on
one
of
these
tables
the
eight
volumes
were
ranged
flat
in
a
row
like
a
galvanic
battery
on
the
other
certain
squat
of
inviting
appearance
seemed
to
stand
on
tiptoe
to
exchange
glances
with
mr
wegg
over
a
front
row
of
tumblers
and
a
basin
of
white
sugar
on
the
hob
a
kettle
steamed
on
the
hearth
a
cat
reposed
facing
the
fire
between
the
settles
a
sofa
a
footstool
and
a
little
table
formed
a
centrepiece
devoted
to
mrs
boffin
they
were
garish
in
taste
and
colour
but
were
expensive
articles
of
furniture
that
had
a
very
odd
look
beside
the
settles
and
the
flaring
gaslight
pendent
from
the
ceiling
there
was
a
flowery
carpet
on
the
floor
but
instead
of
reaching
to
the
fireside
its
glowing
vegetation
stopped
short
at
mrs
boffin
footstool
and
gave
place
to
a
region
of
sand
and
sawdust
mr
wegg
also
noticed
with
admiring
eyes
that
while
the
flowery
land
displayed
such
hollow
ornamentation
as
stuffed
birds
and
waxen
fruits
under
there
were
in
the
territory
where
vegetation
ceased
compensatory
shelves
on
which
the
best
part
of
a
large
pie
and
likewise
of
a
cold
joint
were
plainly
discernible
among
other
solids
the
room
itself
was
large
though
low
and
the
heavy
frames
of
its
windows
and
the
heavy
beams
in
its
crooked
ceiling
seemed
to
indicate
that
it
had
once
been
a
house
of
some
mark
standing
alone
in
the
country
you
like
it
wegg
asked
mr
boffin
in
his
pouncing
manner
admire
it
greatly
sir
said
wegg
comfort
at
this
fireside
sir
you
understand
it
wegg
in
a
general
way
sir
mr
wegg
was
beginning
slowly
and
knowingly
with
his
head
stuck
on
one
side
as
evasive
people
do
begin
when
the
other
cut
him
short
do
understand
it
wegg
and
i
explain
it
these
arrangements
is
made
by
mutual
consent
between
mrs
boffin
and
me
mrs
boffin
as
mentioned
is
a
highflyer
at
fashion
at
present
i
not
i
do
go
higher
than
comfort
and
comfort
of
the
sort
that
i
equal
to
the
enjoyment
of
well
then
where
would
be
the
good
of
mrs
boffin
and
me
quarrelling
over
it
we
never
did
quarrel
before
we
come
into
bower
as
a
property
why
quarrel
when
we
have
come
into
boffin
bower
as
a
property
so
mrs
boffin
she
keeps
up
her
part
of
the
room
in
her
way
i
keep
up
my
part
of
the
room
in
mine
in
consequence
of
which
we
have
at
once
sociability
i
should
go
melancholy
mad
without
mrs
boffin
fashion
and
comfort
if
i
get
by
degrees
to
be
a
at
fashion
then
mrs
boffin
will
by
degrees
come
if
mrs
boffin
should
ever
be
less
of
a
dab
at
fashion
than
she
is
at
the
present
time
then
mrs
boffin
carpet
would
go
if
we
should
both
continny
as
we
are
why
then
here
we
are
and
give
us
a
kiss
old
lady
mrs
boffin
who
perpetually
smiling
had
approached
and
drawn
her
plump
arm
through
her
lord
most
willingly
complied
fashion
in
the
form
of
her
black
velvet
hat
and
feathers
tried
to
prevent
it
but
got
deservedly
crushed
in
the
endeavour
now
wegg
said
mr
boffin
wiping
his
mouth
with
an
air
of
much
refreshment
begin
to
know
us
as
we
are
this
is
a
charming
spot
is
the
bower
but
you
must
get
to
apprechiate
it
by
degrees
it
a
spot
to
find
out
the
merits
of
little
by
little
and
a
every
day
there
a
serpentining
walk
up
each
of
the
mounds
that
gives
you
the
yard
and
neighbourhood
changing
every
moment
when
you
get
to
the
top
there
a
view
of
the
neighbouring
premises
not
to
be
surpassed
the
premises
of
mrs
boffin
late
father
canine
provision
trade
you
look
down
into
as
if
they
was
your
own
and
the
top
of
the
high
mound
is
crowned
with
a
arbour
in
which
if
you
do
read
out
loud
many
a
book
in
the
summer
ay
and
as
a
friend
drop
many
a
time
into
poetry
too
it
sha
be
my
fault
now
what
you
read
on
you
sir
returned
wegg
as
if
there
were
nothing
new
in
his
reading
at
all
generally
do
it
on
gin
and
water
the
organ
moist
does
it
wegg
asked
mr
boffin
with
innocent
eagerness
sir
replied
wegg
coolly
should
hardly
describe
it
so
sir
i
should
say
mellers
it
mellers
it
is
the
word
i
should
employ
mr
boffin
his
wooden
conceit
and
craft
kept
exact
pace
with
the
delighted
expectation
of
his
victim
the
visions
rising
before
his
mercenary
mind
of
the
many
ways
in
which
this
connexion
was
to
be
turned
to
account
never
obscured
the
foremost
idea
natural
to
a
dull
overreaching
man
that
he
must
not
make
himself
too
cheap
mrs
boffin
fashion
as
a
less
inexorable
deity
than
the
idol
usually
worshipped
under
that
name
did
not
forbid
her
mixing
for
her
literary
guest
or
asking
if
he
found
the
result
to
his
liking
on
his
returning
a
gracious
answer
and
taking
his
place
at
the
literary
settle
mr
boffin
began
to
compose
himself
as
a
listener
at
the
opposite
settle
with
exultant
eyes
to
deprive
you
of
a
pipe
wegg
he
said
filling
his
own
you
ca
do
both
together
oh
and
another
thing
i
forgot
to
name
when
you
come
in
here
of
an
evening
and
look
round
you
and
notice
anything
on
a
shelf
that
happens
to
catch
your
fancy
mention
it
wegg
who
had
been
going
to
put
on
his
spectacles
immediately
laid
them
down
with
the
sprightly
observation
read
my
thoughts
sir
do
my
eyes
deceive
me
or
is
that
object
up
there
a
a
pie
it
ca
be
a
pie
it
a
pie
wegg
replied
mr
boffin
with
a
glance
of
some
little
discomfiture
at
the
decline
and
fall
i
lost
my
smell
for
fruits
or
is
it
a
apple
pie
sir
asked
wegg
a
veal
and
ham
pie
said
mr
boffin
it
indeed
sir
and
it
would
be
hard
sir
to
name
the
pie
that
is
a
better
pie
than
a
weal
and
hammer
said
mr
wegg
nodding
his
head
emotionally
some
wegg
you
mr
boffin
i
think
i
will
at
your
invitation
i
at
any
other
party
at
the
present
juncture
but
at
yours
sir
and
meaty
jelly
too
especially
when
a
little
salt
which
is
the
case
where
there
ham
is
mellering
to
the
organ
is
very
mellering
to
the
organ
mr
wegg
did
not
say
what
organ
but
spoke
with
a
cheerful
generality
so
the
pie
was
brought
down
and
the
worthy
mr
boffin
exercised
his
patience
until
wegg
in
the
exercise
of
his
knife
and
fork
had
finished
the
dish
only
profiting
by
the
opportunity
to
inform
wegg
that
although
it
was
not
strictly
fashionable
to
keep
the
contents
of
a
larder
thus
exposed
to
view
he
mr
boffin
considered
it
hospitable
for
the
reason
that
instead
of
saying
in
a
comparatively
unmeaning
manner
to
a
visitor
are
such
and
such
edibles
down
stairs
will
you
have
anything
up
you
took
the
bold
practical
course
of
saying
your
eye
along
the
shelves
and
if
you
see
anything
you
like
there
have
it
down
and
now
mr
wegg
at
length
pushed
away
his
plate
and
put
on
his
spectacles
and
mr
boffin
lighted
his
pipe
and
looked
with
beaming
eyes
into
the
opening
world
before
him
and
mrs
boffin
reclined
in
a
fashionable
manner
on
her
sofa
as
one
who
would
be
part
of
the
audience
if
she
found
she
could
and
would
go
to
sleep
if
she
found
she
could
began
wegg
mr
boffin
and
lady
is
the
first
chapter
of
the
first
wollume
of
the
decline
and
fall
off
here
he
looked
hard
at
the
book
and
stopped
the
matter
wegg
it
comes
into
my
mind
do
you
know
sir
said
wegg
with
an
air
of
insinuating
frankness
having
first
again
looked
hard
at
the
book
you
made
a
little
mistake
this
morning
which
i
had
meant
to
set
you
right
in
only
something
put
it
out
of
my
head
i
think
you
said
rooshan
empire
sir
is
rooshan
ai
it
wegg
sir
roman
roman
the
difference
wegg
difference
sir
mr
wegg
was
faltering
and
in
danger
of
breaking
down
when
a
bright
thought
flashed
upon
him
difference
sir
there
you
place
me
in
a
difficulty
mr
boffin
suffice
it
to
observe
that
the
difference
is
best
postponed
to
some
other
occasion
when
mrs
boffin
does
not
honour
us
with
her
company
in
mrs
boffin
presence
sir
we
had
better
drop
it
mr
wegg
thus
came
out
of
his
disadvantage
with
quite
a
chivalrous
air
and
not
only
that
but
by
dint
of
repeating
with
a
manly
delicacy
mrs
boffin
presence
sir
we
had
better
drop
it
turned
the
disadvantage
on
boffin
who
felt
that
he
had
committed
himself
in
a
very
painful
manner
then
mr
wegg
in
a
dry
unflinching
way
entered
on
his
task
going
straight
across
country
at
everything
that
came
before
him
taking
all
the
hard
words
biographical
and
geographical
getting
rather
shaken
by
hadrian
trajan
and
the
antonines
stumbling
at
polybius
pronounced
polly
beeious
and
supposed
by
mr
boffin
to
be
a
roman
virgin
and
by
mrs
boffin
to
be
responsible
for
that
necessity
of
dropping
it
heavily
unseated
by
titus
antoninus
pius
up
again
and
galloping
smoothly
with
augustus
finally
getting
over
the
ground
well
with
commodus
who
under
the
appellation
of
commodious
was
held
by
mr
boffin
to
have
been
quite
unworthy
of
his
english
origin
and
to
have
acted
up
to
his
name
in
his
government
of
the
roman
people
with
the
death
of
this
personage
mr
wegg
terminated
his
first
reading
long
before
which
consummation
several
total
eclipses
of
mrs
boffin
candle
behind
her
black
velvet
disc
would
have
been
very
alarming
but
for
being
regularly
accompanied
by
a
potent
smell
of
burnt
pens
when
her
feathers
took
fire
which
acted
as
a
restorative
and
woke
her
mr
wegg
having
read
on
by
rote
and
attached
as
few
ideas
as
possible
to
the
text
came
out
of
the
encounter
fresh
but
mr
boffin
who
had
soon
laid
down
his
unfinished
pipe
and
had
ever
since
sat
intently
staring
with
his
eyes
and
mind
at
the
confounding
enormities
of
the
romans
was
so
severely
punished
that
he
could
hardly
wish
his
literary
friend
and
articulate
gasped
mr
boffin
staring
at
the
moon
after
letting
wegg
out
at
the
gate
and
fastening
it
fights
in
that
seven
hundred
and
times
in
one
character
only
as
if
that
was
stunning
enough
a
hundred
lions
is
turned
into
the
same
all
at
once
as
if
that
was
stunning
enough
commodious
in
another
character
kills
all
off
in
a
hundred
goes
as
if
that
was
stunning
enough
and
well
named
too
eats
six
millions
worth
english
money
in
seven
months
wegg
takes
it
easy
but
to
a
old
bird
like
myself
these
are
scarers
and
even
now
that
commodious
is
strangled
i
do
see
a
way
to
our
bettering
ourselves
mr
boffin
added
as
he
turned
his
pensive
steps
towards
the
bower
and
shook
his
head
did
think
this
morning
there
was
half
so
many
scarers
in
print
but
i
in
for
it
now
chapter
cut
adrift
the
six
jolly
fellowship
porters
already
mentioned
as
a
tavern
of
a
dropsical
appearance
had
long
settled
down
into
a
state
of
hale
infirmity
in
its
whole
constitution
it
had
not
a
straight
floor
and
hardly
a
straight
line
but
it
had
outlasted
and
clearly
would
yet
outlast
many
a
building
many
a
sprucer
externally
it
was
a
narrow
lopsided
wooden
jumble
of
corpulent
windows
heaped
one
upon
another
as
you
might
heap
as
many
toppling
oranges
with
a
crazy
wooden
verandah
impending
over
the
water
indeed
the
whole
house
inclusive
of
the
complaining
on
the
roof
impended
over
the
water
but
seemed
to
have
got
into
the
condition
of
a
diver
who
has
paused
so
long
on
the
brink
that
he
will
never
go
in
at
all
this
description
applies
to
the
of
the
six
jolly
fellowship
porters
the
back
of
the
establishment
though
the
chief
entrance
was
there
so
contracted
that
it
merely
represented
in
its
connexion
with
the
front
the
handle
of
a
flat
iron
set
upright
on
its
broadest
end
this
handle
stood
at
the
bottom
of
a
wilderness
of
court
and
alley
which
wilderness
pressed
so
hard
and
close
upon
the
six
jolly
fellowship
porters
as
to
leave
the
hostelry
not
an
inch
of
ground
beyond
its
door
for
this
reason
in
combination
with
the
fact
that
the
house
was
all
but
afloat
at
high
water
when
the
porters
had
a
family
wash
the
linen
subjected
to
that
operation
might
usually
be
seen
drying
on
lines
stretched
across
the
and
the
wood
forming
the
beams
partitions
floors
and
doors
of
the
six
jolly
fellowship
porters
seemed
in
its
old
age
fraught
with
confused
memories
of
its
youth
in
many
places
it
had
become
gnarled
and
riven
according
to
the
manner
of
old
trees
knots
started
out
of
it
and
here
and
there
it
seemed
to
twist
itself
into
some
likeness
of
boughs
in
this
state
of
second
childhood
it
had
an
air
of
being
in
its
own
way
garrulous
about
its
early
life
not
without
reason
was
it
often
asserted
by
the
regular
frequenters
of
the
porters
that
when
the
light
shone
full
upon
the
grain
of
certain
panels
and
particularly
upon
an
old
corner
cupboard
of
in
the
bar
you
might
trace
little
forests
there
and
tiny
trees
like
the
parent
tree
in
full
umbrageous
leaf
the
bar
of
the
six
jolly
fellowship
porters
was
a
bar
to
soften
the
human
breast
the
available
space
in
it
was
not
much
larger
than
a
but
no
one
could
have
wished
the
bar
bigger
that
space
was
so
girt
in
by
corpulent
little
casks
and
by
radiant
with
fictitious
grapes
in
bunches
and
by
lemons
in
nets
and
by
biscuits
in
baskets
and
by
the
polite
that
made
low
bows
when
customers
were
served
with
beer
and
by
the
cheese
in
a
snug
corner
and
by
the
landlady
own
small
table
in
a
snugger
corner
near
the
fire
with
the
cloth
everlastingly
laid
this
haven
was
divided
from
the
rough
world
by
a
glass
partition
and
a
with
a
leaden
sill
upon
it
for
the
convenience
of
resting
your
liquor
but
over
this
the
bar
snugness
so
gushed
forth
that
albeit
customers
drank
there
standing
in
a
dark
and
draughty
passage
where
they
were
shouldered
by
other
customers
passing
in
and
out
they
always
appeared
to
drink
under
an
enchanting
delusion
that
they
were
in
the
bar
itself
for
the
rest
both
the
tap
and
parlour
of
the
six
jolly
fellowship
porters
gave
upon
the
river
and
had
red
curtains
matching
the
noses
of
the
regular
customers
and
were
provided
with
comfortable
fireside
tin
utensils
like
models
of
hats
made
in
that
shape
that
they
might
with
their
pointed
ends
seek
out
for
themselves
glowing
nooks
in
the
depths
of
the
red
coals
when
they
mulled
your
ale
or
heated
for
you
those
delectable
drinks
purl
flip
and
dog
nose
the
first
of
these
humming
compounds
was
a
speciality
of
the
porters
which
through
an
inscription
on
its
gently
appealed
to
your
feelings
as
early
purl
house
for
it
would
seem
that
purl
must
always
be
taken
early
though
whether
for
any
more
distinctly
stomachic
reason
than
that
as
the
early
bird
catches
the
worm
so
the
early
purl
catches
the
customer
can
not
here
be
resolved
it
only
remains
to
add
that
in
the
handle
of
the
flat
iron
and
opposite
the
bar
was
a
very
little
room
like
a
hat
into
which
no
direct
ray
of
sun
moon
or
star
ever
penetrated
but
which
was
superstitiously
regarded
as
a
sanctuary
replete
with
comfort
and
retirement
by
gaslight
and
on
the
door
of
which
was
therefore
painted
its
alluring
name
cosy
miss
potterson
sole
proprietor
and
manager
of
the
fellowship
porters
reigned
supreme
on
her
throne
the
bar
and
a
man
must
have
drunk
himself
mad
drunk
indeed
if
he
thought
he
could
contest
a
point
with
her
being
known
on
her
own
authority
as
miss
abbey
potterson
some
heads
which
like
the
water
were
none
of
the
clearest
harboured
muddled
notions
that
because
of
her
dignity
and
firmness
she
was
named
after
or
in
some
sort
related
to
the
abbey
at
westminster
but
abbey
was
only
short
for
abigail
by
which
name
miss
potterson
had
been
christened
at
limehouse
church
some
sixty
and
odd
years
before
you
mind
you
riderhood
said
miss
abbey
potterson
with
emphatic
forefinger
over
the
fellowship
do
want
you
at
all
and
would
rather
by
far
have
your
room
than
your
company
but
if
you
were
as
welcome
here
as
you
are
not
you
should
even
then
have
another
drop
of
drink
here
this
night
after
this
present
pint
of
beer
so
make
the
most
of
it
you
know
miss
potterson
this
was
suggested
very
meekly
though
i
behave
myself
you
ca
help
serving
me
miss
i
said
abbey
with
infinite
expression
miss
potterson
because
you
see
the
law
am
the
law
here
my
man
returned
miss
abbey
i
soon
convince
you
of
that
if
you
doubt
it
at
all
never
said
i
did
doubt
it
at
all
miss
abbey
much
the
better
for
you
abbey
the
supreme
threw
the
customer
halfpence
into
the
till
and
seating
herself
in
her
resumed
the
newspaper
she
had
been
reading
she
was
a
tall
upright
woman
though
severe
of
countenance
and
had
more
of
the
air
of
a
schoolmistress
than
mistress
of
the
six
jolly
fellowship
porters
the
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
was
a
with
a
squinting
leer
and
he
eyed
her
as
if
he
were
one
of
her
pupils
in
disgrace
cruel
hard
upon
me
miss
potterson
miss
potterson
read
her
newspaper
with
contracted
brows
and
took
no
notice
until
he
whispered
potterson
might
i
have
half
a
word
with
you
deigning
then
to
turn
her
eyes
sideways
towards
the
suppliant
miss
potterson
beheld
him
knuckling
his
low
forehead
and
ducking
at
her
with
his
head
as
if
he
were
asking
leave
to
fling
himself
head
foremost
over
the
and
alight
on
his
feet
in
the
bar
said
miss
potterson
with
a
manner
as
short
as
she
herself
was
long
your
half
word
bring
it
out
potterson
would
you
me
taking
the
liberty
of
asking
is
it
my
character
that
you
take
objections
to
said
miss
potterson
it
that
you
afraid
of
am
not
afraid
of
you
interposed
miss
potterson
you
mean
that
i
humbly
do
mean
that
miss
abbey
what
do
you
mean
really
are
so
cruel
hard
upon
me
what
i
was
going
to
make
inquiries
was
no
more
than
might
you
have
any
apprehensions
leastways
beliefs
or
suppositions
that
the
company
property
might
be
altogether
to
be
considered
safe
if
i
used
the
house
too
regular
do
you
want
to
know
for
miss
abbey
respectfully
meaning
no
offence
to
you
it
would
be
some
satisfaction
to
a
man
mind
to
understand
why
the
fellowship
porters
is
not
to
be
free
to
such
as
me
and
is
to
be
free
to
such
as
gaffer
the
face
of
the
hostess
darkened
with
some
shadow
of
perplexity
as
she
replied
has
never
been
where
you
have
been
in
quod
miss
perhaps
not
but
he
may
have
merited
it
he
may
be
suspected
of
far
worse
than
ever
i
was
suspects
him
perhaps
one
beyond
all
doubts
i
do
are
not
much
said
miss
abbey
potterson
knitting
her
brows
again
with
disdain
i
was
his
pardner
mind
you
miss
abbey
i
was
his
pardner
as
such
i
know
more
of
the
ins
and
outs
of
him
than
any
person
living
does
notice
this
i
am
the
man
that
was
his
pardner
and
i
am
the
man
that
suspects
him
suggested
miss
abbey
though
with
a
deeper
shade
of
perplexity
than
before
criminate
yourself
i
do
miss
abbey
for
how
does
it
stand
it
stands
this
way
when
i
was
his
pardner
i
could
never
give
him
satisfaction
why
i
never
give
him
satisfaction
because
my
luck
was
bad
because
i
could
find
many
enough
of
how
was
his
luck
always
good
notice
this
always
good
ah
there
a
many
games
miss
abbey
in
which
there
chance
but
there
a
many
others
in
which
there
skill
too
mixed
along
with
it
gaffer
has
a
skill
in
finding
what
he
finds
who
doubts
man
asked
miss
abbey
skill
in
purwiding
what
he
finds
perhaps
said
riderhood
shaking
his
evil
head
miss
abbey
knitted
her
brow
at
him
as
he
darkly
leered
at
her
you
out
upon
the
river
pretty
nigh
every
tide
and
if
you
want
to
find
a
man
or
woman
in
the
river
you
greatly
help
your
luck
miss
abbey
by
knocking
a
man
or
woman
on
the
head
aforehand
and
pitching
in
lud
was
the
involuntary
exclamation
of
miss
potterson
you
returned
the
other
stretching
forward
over
the
half
door
to
throw
his
words
into
the
bar
for
his
voice
was
as
if
the
head
of
his
boat
mop
were
down
his
throat
say
so
miss
abbey
and
mind
you
i
follow
him
up
miss
abbey
and
mind
you
i
bring
him
to
hook
at
last
if
it
twenty
year
hence
i
will
who
he
to
be
favoured
along
of
his
daughter
ai
i
got
a
daughter
of
my
own
with
that
flourish
and
seeming
to
have
talked
himself
rather
more
drunk
and
much
more
ferocious
than
he
had
begun
by
being
mr
riderhood
took
up
his
pint
pot
and
swaggered
off
to
the
taproom
gaffer
was
not
there
but
a
pretty
strong
muster
of
miss
abbey
pupils
were
who
exhibited
when
occasion
required
the
greatest
docility
on
the
clock
striking
ten
and
miss
abbey
appearing
at
the
door
and
addressing
a
certain
person
in
a
faded
scarlet
jacket
with
jones
your
time
up
i
told
your
wife
you
should
be
punctual
jones
submissively
rose
gave
the
company
and
retired
at
ten
on
miss
abbey
looking
in
again
and
saying
williams
bob
glamour
and
jonathan
you
are
all
due
williams
bob
and
jonathan
with
similar
meekness
took
their
leave
and
evaporated
greater
wonder
than
these
when
a
person
in
a
glazed
hat
had
after
some
considerable
hesitation
ordered
another
glass
of
gin
and
water
of
the
attendant
potboy
and
when
miss
abbey
instead
of
sending
it
appeared
in
person
saying
joey
you
have
had
as
much
as
will
do
you
good
not
only
did
the
captain
feebly
rub
his
knees
and
contemplate
the
fire
without
offering
a
word
of
protest
but
the
rest
of
the
company
murmured
ay
captain
miss
abbey
right
you
be
guided
by
miss
abbey
captain
nor
was
miss
abbey
vigilance
in
anywise
abated
by
this
submission
but
rather
sharpened
for
looking
round
on
the
deferential
faces
of
her
school
and
descrying
two
other
young
persons
in
need
of
admonition
she
thus
bestowed
it
tootle
it
time
for
a
young
fellow
who
going
to
be
married
next
month
to
be
at
home
and
asleep
and
you
need
nudge
him
mr
jack
mullins
for
i
know
your
work
begins
early
tomorrow
and
i
say
the
same
to
you
so
come
like
good
lads
upon
which
the
blushing
tootle
looked
to
mullins
and
the
blushing
mullins
looked
to
tootle
on
the
question
who
should
rise
first
and
finally
both
rose
together
and
went
out
on
the
broad
grin
followed
by
miss
abbey
in
whose
presence
the
company
did
not
take
the
liberty
of
grinning
likewise
in
such
an
establishment
the
with
his
arranged
in
a
tight
roll
on
each
bare
shoulder
was
a
mere
hint
of
the
possibility
of
physical
force
thrown
out
as
a
matter
of
state
and
form
exactly
at
the
closing
hour
all
the
guests
who
were
left
filed
out
in
the
best
order
miss
abbey
standing
at
the
half
door
of
the
bar
to
hold
a
ceremony
of
review
and
dismissal
all
wished
miss
abbey
and
miss
abbey
wished
to
all
except
riderhood
the
sapient
looking
on
officially
then
had
the
conviction
borne
in
upon
his
soul
that
the
man
was
evermore
outcast
and
excommunicate
from
the
six
jolly
fellowship
porters
bob
gliddery
said
miss
abbey
to
this
round
to
hexam
and
tell
his
daughter
lizzie
that
i
want
to
speak
to
her
with
exemplary
swiftness
bob
gliddery
departed
and
returned
lizzie
following
him
arrived
as
one
of
the
two
female
domestics
of
the
fellowship
porters
arranged
on
the
snug
little
table
by
the
bar
fire
miss
potterson
supper
of
hot
sausages
and
mashed
potatoes
in
and
sit
ye
down
girl
said
miss
abbey
you
eat
a
bit
thank
you
miss
i
have
had
my
supper
have
had
mine
too
i
think
said
miss
abbey
pushing
away
the
untasted
dish
more
than
enough
of
it
i
am
put
out
lizzie
am
very
sorry
for
it
miss
why
in
the
name
of
goodness
quoth
miss
abbey
sharply
you
do
it
do
it
miss
there
do
look
astonished
i
ought
to
have
begun
with
a
word
of
explanation
but
it
my
way
to
make
short
cuts
at
things
i
always
was
a
pepperer
you
bob
gliddery
there
put
the
chain
upon
the
door
and
get
ye
down
to
your
supper
with
an
alacrity
that
seemed
no
less
referable
to
the
pepperer
fact
than
to
the
supper
fact
bob
obeyed
and
his
boots
were
heard
descending
towards
the
bed
of
the
river
hexam
lizzie
hexam
then
began
miss
potterson
often
have
i
held
out
to
you
the
opportunity
of
getting
clear
of
your
father
and
doing
well
often
miss
often
yes
and
i
might
as
well
have
spoken
to
the
iron
funnel
of
the
strongest
steamer
that
passes
the
fellowship
porters
miss
lizzie
pleaded
that
would
not
be
thankful
and
i
am
vow
and
declare
i
am
half
ashamed
of
myself
for
taking
such
an
interest
in
you
said
miss
abbey
pettishly
i
do
believe
i
should
do
it
if
you
were
not
why
ai
you
ugly
lizzie
merely
answered
this
difficult
question
with
an
apologetic
glance
you
ai
resumed
miss
potterson
it
no
use
going
into
that
i
must
take
you
as
i
find
you
which
indeed
is
what
i
done
and
you
mean
to
say
you
are
still
obstinate
obstinate
miss
i
hope
i
suppose
you
call
it
then
miss
fixed
like
was
an
obstinate
person
yet
who
would
own
to
the
word
remarked
miss
potterson
rubbing
her
vexed
nose
sure
i
would
if
i
was
obstinate
but
i
am
a
pepperer
which
is
different
lizzie
hexam
lizzie
hexam
think
again
do
you
know
the
worst
of
your
father
i
know
the
worst
of
father
she
repeated
opening
her
eyes
you
know
the
suspicions
to
which
your
father
makes
himself
liable
do
you
know
the
suspicions
that
are
actually
about
against
him
the
consciousness
of
what
he
habitually
did
oppressed
the
girl
heavily
and
she
slowly
cast
down
her
eyes
lizzie
do
you
know
urged
miss
abbey
to
tell
me
what
the
suspicions
are
miss
she
asked
after
a
silence
with
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
not
an
easy
thing
to
tell
a
daughter
but
it
must
be
told
it
is
thought
by
some
then
that
your
father
helps
to
their
death
a
few
of
those
that
he
finds
dead
the
relief
of
hearing
what
she
felt
sure
was
a
false
suspicion
in
place
of
the
expected
real
and
true
one
so
lightened
lizzie
breast
for
the
moment
that
miss
abbey
was
amazed
at
her
demeanour
she
raised
her
eyes
quickly
shook
her
head
and
in
a
kind
of
triumph
almost
laughed
little
know
father
who
talk
like
that
takes
it
thought
miss
abbey
quietly
she
takes
it
with
extraordinary
quietness
perhaps
said
lizzie
as
a
recollection
flashed
upon
her
is
some
one
who
has
a
grudge
against
father
some
one
who
has
threatened
father
is
it
riderhood
miss
yes
it
is
he
was
father
partner
and
father
broke
with
him
and
now
he
revenges
himself
father
broke
with
him
when
i
was
by
and
he
was
very
angry
at
it
and
besides
miss
abbey
will
you
never
without
strong
reason
let
pass
your
lips
what
i
am
going
to
say
she
bent
forward
to
say
it
in
a
whisper
promise
said
miss
abbey
was
on
the
night
when
the
harmon
murder
was
found
out
through
father
just
above
bridge
and
just
below
bridge
as
we
were
sculling
home
riderhood
crept
out
of
the
dark
in
his
boat
and
many
and
many
times
afterwards
when
such
great
pains
were
taken
to
come
to
the
bottom
of
the
crime
and
it
never
could
be
come
near
i
thought
in
my
own
thoughts
could
riderhood
himself
have
done
the
murder
and
did
he
purposely
let
father
find
the
body
it
seemed
wicked
and
cruel
to
so
much
as
think
such
a
thing
but
now
that
he
tries
to
throw
it
upon
father
i
go
back
to
it
as
if
it
was
a
truth
can
it
be
a
truth
that
was
put
into
my
mind
by
the
dead
she
asked
this
question
rather
of
the
fire
than
of
the
hostess
of
the
fellowship
porters
and
looked
round
the
little
bar
with
troubled
eyes
but
miss
potterson
as
a
ready
schoolmistress
accustomed
to
bring
her
pupils
to
book
set
the
matter
in
a
light
that
was
essentially
of
this
world
poor
deluded
girl
she
said
you
see
that
you
ca
open
your
mind
to
particular
suspicions
of
one
of
the
two
without
opening
your
mind
to
general
suspicions
of
the
other
they
had
worked
together
their
had
been
going
on
for
some
time
even
granting
that
it
was
as
you
have
had
in
your
thoughts
what
the
two
had
done
together
would
come
familiar
to
the
mind
of
one
do
know
father
miss
when
you
talk
like
that
indeed
indeed
you
do
know
father
lizzie
said
miss
potterson
him
you
need
break
with
him
altogether
but
leave
him
do
well
away
from
him
not
because
of
what
i
have
told
you
we
pass
no
judgment
upon
that
and
we
hope
it
may
not
be
but
because
of
what
i
have
urged
on
you
before
no
matter
whether
it
owing
to
your
good
looks
or
not
i
like
you
and
i
want
to
serve
you
lizzie
come
under
my
direction
fling
yourself
away
my
girl
but
be
persuaded
into
being
respectable
and
happy
in
the
sound
good
feeling
and
good
sense
of
her
entreaty
miss
abbey
had
softened
into
a
soothing
tone
and
had
even
drawn
her
arm
round
the
girl
waist
but
she
only
replied
you
thank
you
i
ca
i
wo
i
must
not
think
of
it
the
harder
father
is
borne
upon
the
more
he
needs
me
to
lean
on
and
then
miss
abbey
who
like
all
hard
people
when
they
do
soften
felt
that
there
was
considerable
compensation
owing
to
her
underwent
reaction
and
became
frigid
have
done
what
i
can
she
said
you
must
go
your
way
you
make
your
bed
and
you
must
lie
on
it
but
tell
your
father
one
thing
he
must
not
come
here
any
more
miss
will
you
forbid
him
the
house
where
i
know
he
safe
fellowships
returned
miss
abbey
itself
to
look
to
as
well
as
others
it
has
been
hard
work
to
establish
order
here
and
make
the
fellowships
what
it
is
and
it
is
daily
and
nightly
hard
work
to
keep
it
so
the
fellowships
must
not
have
a
taint
upon
it
that
may
give
it
a
bad
name
i
forbid
the
house
to
riderhood
and
i
forbid
the
house
to
gaffer
i
forbid
both
equally
i
find
from
riderhood
and
you
together
that
there
are
suspicions
against
both
men
and
i
not
going
to
take
upon
myself
to
decide
betwixt
them
they
are
both
tarred
with
a
dirty
brush
and
i
ca
have
the
fellowships
tarred
with
the
same
brush
that
all
i
know
miss
said
lizzie
hexam
sorrowfully
returned
miss
abbey
with
a
shake
of
her
head
me
miss
abbey
i
am
truly
grateful
all
the
same
can
believe
a
good
deal
returned
the
stately
abbey
i
try
to
believe
that
too
lizzie
no
supper
did
miss
potterson
take
that
night
and
only
half
her
usual
tumbler
of
hot
port
negus
and
the
female
domestics
two
robust
sisters
with
staring
black
eyes
shining
flat
red
faces
blunt
noses
and
strong
black
curls
like
dolls
interchanged
the
sentiment
that
missis
had
had
her
hair
combed
the
wrong
way
by
somebody
and
the
afterwards
remarked
that
he
had
been
rattled
to
bed
since
his
late
mother
had
systematically
accelerated
his
retirement
to
rest
with
a
poker
the
chaining
of
the
door
behind
her
as
she
went
forth
disenchanted
lizzie
hexam
of
that
first
relief
she
had
felt
the
night
was
black
and
shrill
the
wilderness
was
melancholy
and
there
was
a
sound
of
in
the
rattling
of
the
and
the
grating
of
the
bolts
and
staples
under
miss
abbey
hand
as
she
came
beneath
the
lowering
sky
a
sense
of
being
involved
in
a
murky
shade
of
murder
dropped
upon
her
and
as
the
tidal
swell
of
the
river
broke
at
her
feet
without
her
seeing
how
it
gathered
so
her
thoughts
startled
her
by
rushing
out
of
an
unseen
void
and
striking
at
her
heart
of
her
father
being
groundlessly
suspected
she
felt
sure
sure
sure
and
yet
repeat
the
word
inwardly
as
often
as
she
would
the
attempt
to
reason
out
and
prove
that
she
was
sure
always
came
after
it
and
failed
riderhood
had
done
the
deed
and
entrapped
her
father
riderhood
had
not
done
the
deed
but
had
resolved
in
his
malice
to
turn
against
her
father
the
appearances
that
were
ready
to
his
hand
to
distort
equally
and
swiftly
upon
either
putting
of
the
case
followed
the
frightful
possibility
that
her
father
being
innocent
yet
might
come
to
be
believed
guilty
she
had
heard
of
people
suffering
death
for
bloodshed
of
which
they
were
afterwards
proved
pure
and
those
persons
were
not
first
in
that
dangerous
wrong
in
which
her
father
stood
then
at
the
best
the
beginning
of
his
being
set
apart
whispered
against
and
avoided
was
a
certain
fact
it
dated
from
that
very
night
and
as
the
great
black
river
with
its
dreary
shores
was
soon
lost
to
her
view
in
the
gloom
so
she
stood
on
the
river
brink
unable
to
see
into
the
vast
blank
misery
of
a
life
suspected
and
fallen
away
from
by
good
and
bad
but
knowing
that
it
lay
there
dim
before
her
stretching
away
to
the
great
ocean
death
one
thing
only
was
clear
to
the
girl
mind
accustomed
from
her
very
babyhood
promptly
to
do
the
thing
that
could
be
done
whether
to
keep
out
weather
to
ward
off
cold
to
postpone
hunger
or
what
not
she
started
out
of
her
meditation
and
ran
home
the
room
was
quiet
and
the
lamp
burnt
on
the
table
in
the
bunk
in
the
corner
her
brother
lay
asleep
she
bent
over
him
softly
kissed
him
and
came
to
the
table
the
time
of
miss
abbey
closing
and
by
the
run
of
the
tide
it
must
be
one
tide
running
up
father
at
chiswick
would
think
of
coming
down
till
after
the
turn
and
that
at
half
after
four
call
charley
at
six
i
shall
hear
the
strike
as
i
sit
here
very
quietly
she
placed
a
chair
before
the
scanty
fire
and
sat
down
in
it
drawing
her
shawl
about
her
hollow
down
by
the
flare
is
not
there
now
poor
charley
the
clock
struck
two
and
the
clock
struck
three
and
the
clock
struck
four
and
she
remained
there
with
a
woman
patience
and
her
own
purpose
when
the
morning
was
well
on
between
four
and
five
she
slipped
off
her
shoes
that
her
going
about
might
not
wake
charley
trimmed
the
fire
sparingly
put
water
on
to
boil
and
set
the
table
for
breakfast
then
she
went
up
the
ladder
lamp
in
hand
and
came
down
again
and
glided
about
and
about
making
a
little
bundle
lastly
from
her
pocket
and
from
the
and
from
an
inverted
basin
on
the
highest
shelf
she
brought
halfpence
a
few
sixpences
fewer
shillings
and
fell
to
laboriously
and
noiselessly
counting
them
and
setting
aside
one
little
heap
she
was
still
so
engaged
when
she
was
startled
by
from
her
brother
sitting
up
in
bed
made
me
jump
charley
did
you
make
me
jump
when
i
opened
my
eyes
a
moment
ago
and
saw
you
sitting
there
like
the
ghost
of
a
girl
miser
in
the
dead
of
the
night
not
the
dead
of
the
night
charley
it
nigh
six
in
the
morning
it
though
but
what
are
you
up
to
liz
telling
your
fortune
charley
seems
to
be
a
precious
small
one
if
that
it
said
the
boy
are
you
putting
that
little
pile
of
money
by
itself
for
you
charley
do
you
mean
out
of
bed
charley
and
get
washed
and
dressed
and
then
i
tell
you
her
composed
manner
and
her
low
distinct
voice
always
had
an
influence
over
him
his
head
was
soon
in
a
basin
of
water
and
out
of
it
again
and
staring
at
her
through
a
storm
of
towelling
never
towelling
at
himself
as
if
he
were
his
bitterest
enemy
such
a
girl
as
you
are
what
is
the
move
liz
you
almost
ready
for
breakfast
charley
can
pour
it
out
i
say
and
a
bundle
a
bundle
charley
do
mean
it
for
me
too
charley
i
do
indeed
more
serious
of
face
and
more
slow
of
action
than
he
had
been
the
boy
completed
his
dressing
and
came
and
sat
down
at
the
little
with
his
eyes
amazedly
directed
to
her
face
see
charley
dear
i
have
made
up
my
mind
that
this
is
the
right
time
for
your
going
away
from
us
over
and
above
all
the
blessed
change
of
you
be
much
happier
and
do
much
better
even
so
soon
as
next
month
even
so
soon
as
next
week
do
you
know
i
shall
do
quite
know
how
charley
but
i
do
in
spite
of
her
unchanged
manner
of
speaking
and
her
unchanged
appearance
of
composure
she
scarcely
trusted
herself
to
look
at
him
but
kept
her
eyes
employed
on
the
cutting
and
buttering
of
his
bread
and
on
the
mixing
of
his
tea
and
other
such
little
preparations
must
leave
father
to
me
charley
i
will
do
what
i
can
with
him
but
you
must
go
do
stand
upon
ceremony
i
think
grumbled
the
boy
throwing
his
bread
and
butter
about
in
an
she
made
him
no
answer
tell
you
what
said
the
boy
then
bursting
out
into
an
angry
whimpering
a
selfish
jade
and
you
think
there
not
enough
for
three
of
us
and
you
want
to
get
rid
of
me
you
believe
so
charley
yes
then
i
believe
too
that
i
am
a
selfish
jade
and
that
i
think
there
not
enough
for
three
of
us
and
that
i
want
to
get
rid
of
you
it
was
only
when
the
boy
rushed
at
her
and
threw
his
arms
round
her
neck
that
she
lost
her
but
she
lost
it
then
and
wept
over
him
cry
do
cry
i
am
satisfied
to
go
liz
i
am
satisfied
to
go
i
know
you
send
me
away
for
my
good
charley
charley
heaven
above
us
knows
i
do
yes
do
mind
what
i
said
do
remember
it
kiss
me
after
a
silence
she
loosed
him
to
dry
her
eyes
and
regain
her
strong
quiet
influence
listen
charley
dear
we
both
know
it
must
be
done
and
i
alone
know
there
is
good
reason
for
its
being
done
at
once
go
straight
to
the
school
and
say
that
you
and
i
agreed
upon
it
that
we
ca
overcome
father
opposition
that
father
will
never
trouble
them
but
will
never
take
you
back
you
are
a
credit
to
the
school
and
you
will
be
a
greater
credit
to
it
yet
and
they
will
help
you
to
get
a
living
show
what
clothes
you
have
brought
and
what
money
and
say
that
i
will
send
some
more
money
if
i
can
get
some
in
no
other
way
i
will
ask
a
little
help
of
those
two
gentlemen
who
came
here
that
night
say
cried
her
brother
quickly
you
have
it
of
that
chap
that
took
hold
of
me
by
the
chin
do
you
have
it
of
that
wrayburn
one
perhaps
a
slight
additional
tinge
of
red
flushed
up
into
her
face
and
brow
as
with
a
nod
she
laid
a
hand
upon
his
lips
to
keep
him
silently
attentive
above
all
things
mind
this
charley
be
sure
you
always
speak
well
of
father
be
sure
you
always
give
father
his
full
due
you
ca
deny
that
because
father
has
no
learning
himself
he
is
set
against
it
in
you
but
favour
nothing
else
against
him
and
be
sure
you
say
as
you
know
that
your
sister
is
devoted
to
him
and
if
you
should
ever
happen
to
hear
anything
said
against
father
that
is
new
to
you
it
will
not
be
true
remember
charley
it
will
not
be
true
the
boy
looked
at
her
with
some
doubt
and
surprise
but
she
went
on
again
without
heeding
it
all
things
remember
it
will
not
be
true
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
charley
dear
except
be
good
and
get
learning
and
only
think
of
some
things
in
the
old
life
here
as
if
you
had
dreamed
them
in
a
dream
last
night
my
darling
though
so
young
she
infused
in
these
parting
words
a
love
that
was
far
more
like
a
mother
than
a
sister
and
before
which
the
boy
was
quite
bowed
down
after
holding
her
to
his
breast
with
a
passionate
cry
he
took
up
his
bundle
and
darted
out
at
the
door
with
an
arm
across
his
eyes
the
white
face
of
the
winter
day
came
sluggishly
on
veiled
in
a
frosty
mist
and
the
shadowy
ships
in
the
river
slowly
changed
to
black
substances
and
the
sun
on
the
eastern
marshes
behind
dark
masts
and
yards
seemed
filled
with
the
ruins
of
a
forest
it
had
set
on
fire
lizzie
looking
for
her
father
saw
him
coming
and
stood
upon
the
causeway
that
he
might
see
her
he
had
nothing
with
him
but
his
boat
and
came
on
apace
a
knot
of
those
amphibious
who
appear
to
have
some
mysterious
power
of
extracting
a
subsistence
out
of
tidal
water
by
looking
at
it
were
gathered
together
about
the
causeway
as
her
father
boat
grounded
they
became
contemplative
of
the
mud
and
dispersed
themselves
she
saw
that
the
mute
avoidance
had
begun
gaffer
saw
it
too
in
so
far
as
that
he
was
moved
when
he
set
foot
on
shore
to
stare
around
him
but
he
promptly
set
to
work
to
haul
up
his
boat
and
make
her
fast
and
take
the
sculls
and
rudder
and
rope
out
of
her
carrying
these
with
lizzie
aid
he
passed
up
to
his
dwelling
close
to
the
fire
father
dear
while
i
cook
your
breakfast
it
all
ready
for
cooking
and
only
been
waiting
for
you
you
must
be
frozen
lizzie
i
ai
of
a
glow
that
certain
and
my
hands
seem
nailed
through
to
the
sculls
see
how
dead
they
are
something
suggestive
in
their
colour
and
perhaps
in
her
face
struck
him
as
he
held
them
up
he
turned
his
shoulder
and
held
them
down
to
the
fire
were
not
out
in
the
perishing
night
i
hope
father
my
dear
lay
aboard
a
barge
by
a
blazing
where
that
boy
a
drop
of
brandy
for
your
tea
father
if
you
put
it
in
while
i
turn
this
bit
of
meat
if
the
river
was
to
get
frozen
there
would
be
a
deal
of
distress
would
there
father
there
always
enough
of
that
said
gaffer
dropping
the
liquor
into
his
cup
from
a
squat
black
bottle
and
dropping
it
slowly
that
it
might
seem
more
is
for
ever
a
going
about
like
sut
in
the
air
ai
that
boy
up
yet
meat
ready
now
father
eat
it
while
it
hot
and
comfortable
after
you
have
finished
we
turn
round
to
the
fire
and
talk
but
he
perceived
that
he
was
evaded
and
having
thrown
a
hasty
angry
glance
towards
the
bunk
plucked
at
a
corner
of
her
apron
and
asked
gone
with
that
boy
if
you
begin
your
breakfast
i
sit
by
and
tell
you
he
looked
at
her
stirred
his
tea
and
took
two
or
three
gulps
then
cut
at
his
piece
of
hot
steak
with
his
and
said
eating
then
what
gone
with
that
boy
be
angry
dear
it
seems
father
that
he
has
quite
a
gift
of
learning
young
beggar
said
the
parent
shaking
his
knife
in
the
air
that
having
this
gift
and
not
being
equally
good
at
other
things
he
has
made
shift
to
get
some
schooling
young
beggar
said
the
parent
again
with
his
former
and
that
knowing
you
have
nothing
to
spare
father
and
not
wishing
to
be
a
burden
on
you
he
gradually
made
up
his
mind
to
go
seek
his
fortune
out
of
learning
he
went
away
this
morning
father
and
he
cried
very
much
at
going
and
he
hoped
you
would
forgive
him
him
never
come
a
nigh
me
to
ask
me
my
forgiveness
said
the
father
again
emphasizing
his
words
with
the
knife
him
never
come
within
sight
of
my
eyes
nor
yet
within
reach
of
my
arm
his
own
father
ai
good
enough
for
him
he
disowned
his
own
father
his
own
father
therefore
disowns
him
for
ever
and
ever
as
a
young
beggar
he
had
pushed
away
his
plate
with
the
natural
need
of
a
strong
rough
man
in
anger
to
do
something
forcible
he
now
clutched
his
knife
overhand
and
struck
downward
with
it
at
the
end
of
every
succeeding
sentence
as
he
would
have
struck
with
his
own
clenched
fist
if
there
had
chanced
to
be
nothing
in
it
welcome
to
go
he
more
welcome
to
go
than
to
stay
but
let
him
never
come
back
let
him
never
put
his
head
inside
that
door
and
let
you
never
speak
a
word
more
in
his
favour
or
you
disown
your
own
father
likewise
and
what
your
father
says
of
him
he
have
to
come
to
say
of
you
now
i
see
why
them
men
yonder
held
aloof
from
me
they
says
to
one
another
here
comes
the
man
as
ai
good
enough
for
his
own
son
lizzie
but
she
stopped
him
with
a
cry
looking
at
her
he
saw
her
with
a
face
quite
strange
to
him
shrinking
back
against
the
wall
with
her
hands
before
her
eyes
do
i
ca
bear
to
see
you
striking
with
it
put
it
down
he
looked
at
the
knife
but
in
his
astonishment
still
held
it
it
too
horrible
o
put
it
down
put
it
down
confounded
by
her
appearance
and
exclamation
he
tossed
it
away
and
stood
up
with
his
open
hands
held
out
before
him
come
to
you
liz
can
you
think
i
would
strike
at
you
with
a
knife
father
no
you
would
never
hurt
me
should
i
hurt
dear
father
on
my
knees
i
am
certain
in
my
heart
and
soul
i
am
certain
nothing
but
it
was
too
dreadful
to
bear
for
it
looked
her
hands
covering
her
face
again
it
looked
did
it
look
like
the
recollection
of
his
murderous
figure
combining
with
her
trial
of
last
night
and
her
trial
of
the
morning
caused
her
to
drop
at
his
feet
without
having
answered
he
had
never
seen
her
so
before
he
raised
her
with
the
utmost
tenderness
calling
her
the
best
of
daughters
and
poor
pretty
creetur
and
laid
her
head
upon
his
knee
and
tried
to
restore
her
but
failing
he
laid
her
head
gently
down
again
got
a
pillow
and
placed
it
under
her
dark
hair
and
sought
on
the
table
for
a
spoonful
of
brandy
there
being
none
left
he
hurriedly
caught
up
the
empty
bottle
and
ran
out
at
the
door
he
returned
as
hurriedly
as
he
had
gone
with
the
bottle
still
empty
he
kneeled
down
by
her
took
her
head
on
his
arm
and
moistened
her
lips
with
a
little
water
into
which
he
dipped
his
fingers
saying
fiercely
as
he
looked
around
now
over
this
shoulder
now
over
that
we
got
a
pest
in
the
house
is
there
deadly
sticking
to
my
clothes
what
let
loose
upon
us

loosed

wegg

after
himself

on
his
road

clerkenwell
the
time
is
early
in
the
evening
the
weather
moist
and
raw
mr
wegg
finds
leisure
to
make
a
little
circuit
by
reason
that
he
folds
his
screen
early
now
that
he
combines
another
source
of
income
with
it
and
also
that
he
feels
it
due
to
himself
to
be
anxiously
expected
at
the
bower

get
all
the
eagerer
for
waiting
a
bit
says
silas
screwing
up
as
he
stumps
along
first
his
right
eye
and
then
his
left
which
is
something
superfluous
in
him
for
nature
has
already
screwed
both
pretty
tight
i
get
on
with
him
as
i
expect
to
get
on
silas
pursues
stumping
and
meditating
would
become
me
to
leave
it
here
it
would
be
respectable
animated
by
this
reflection
he
stumps
faster
and
looks
a
long
way
before
him
as
a
man
with
an
ambitious
project
in
abeyance
often
will
do
aware
of
a
population
taking
sanctuary
about
the
church
in
clerkenwell
mr
wegg
is
conscious
of
an
interest
in
and
a
respect
for
the
neighbourhood
but
his
sensations
in
this
regard
halt
as
to
their
strict
morality
as
he
halts
in
his
gait
for
they
suggest
the
delights
of
a
coat
of
invisibility
in
which
to
walk
off
safely
with
the
precious
stones
and
but
stop
short
of
any
compunction
for
the
people
who
would
lose
the
same
not
however
towards
the
where
cunning
artificers
work
in
pearls
and
diamonds
and
gold
and
silver
making
their
hands
so
rich
that
the
enriched
water
in
which
they
wash
them
is
bought
for
the
refiners
not
towards
these
does
mr
wegg
stump
but
towards
the
poorer
shops
of
small
retail
traders
in
commodities
to
eat
and
drink
and
keep
folks
warm
and
of
italian
and
of
barbers
and
of
brokers
and
of
dealers
in
dogs
and
from
these
in
a
narrow
and
a
dirty
street
devoted
to
such
callings
mr
wegg
selects
one
dark
with
a
tallow
candle
dimly
burning
in
it
surrounded
by
a
muddle
of
objects
vaguely
resembling
pieces
of
leather
and
dry
stick
but
among
which
nothing
is
resolvable
into
anything
distinct
save
the
candle
itself
in
its
old
tin
candlestick
and
two
preserved
frogs
fighting
a
duel
stumping
with
fresh
vigour
he
goes
in
at
the
dark
greasy
entry
pushes
a
little
greasy
dark
reluctant
and
follows
the
door
into
the
little
dark
greasy
shop
it
is
so
dark
that
nothing
can
be
made
out
in
it
over
a
little
counter
but
another
tallow
candle
in
another
old
tin
candlestick
close
to
the
face
of
a
man
stooping
low
in
a
chair
mr
wegg
nods
to
the
face
evening
the
face
looking
up
is
a
sallow
face
with
weak
eyes
surmounted
by
a
tangle
of
hair
the
owner
of
the
face
has
no
cravat
on
and
has
opened
his
tumbled
to
work
with
the
more
ease
for
the
same
reason
he
has
no
coat
on
only
a
loose
waistcoat
over
his
yellow
linen
his
eyes
are
like
the
eyes
of
an
engraver
but
he
is
not
that
his
expression
and
stoop
are
like
those
of
a
shoemaker
but
he
is
not
that
evening
mr
venus
do
you
remember
with
slowly
dawning
remembrance
mr
venus
rises
and
holds
his
candle
over
the
little
counter
and
holds
it
down
towards
the
legs
natural
and
artificial
of
mr
wegg
be
sure
he
says
then
do
you
do
you
know
that
gentleman
explains
yes
says
the
other
amputation
so
says
mr
wegg
yes
quoth
venus
do
you
do
sit
down
by
the
fire
and
warm
your
your
other
one
the
little
counter
being
so
short
a
counter
that
it
leaves
the
fireplace
which
would
have
been
behind
it
if
it
had
been
longer
accessible
mr
wegg
sits
down
on
a
box
in
front
of
the
fire
and
inhales
a
warm
and
comfortable
smell
which
is
not
the
smell
of
the
shop
that
mr
wegg
inwardly
decides
as
he
takes
a
corrective
sniff
or
two
musty
leathery
feathery
cellary
gluey
gummy
and
with
another
sniff
it
might
be
strong
of
old
pairs
of
bellows
tea
is
drawing
and
my
muffin
is
on
the
hob
mr
wegg
will
you
partake
it
being
one
of
mr
wegg
guiding
rules
in
life
always
to
partake
he
says
he
will
but
the
little
shop
is
so
excessively
dark
is
stuck
so
full
of
black
shelves
and
brackets
and
nooks
and
corners
that
he
sees
mr
venus
cup
and
saucer
only
because
it
is
close
under
the
candle
and
does
not
see
from
what
mysterious
recess
mr
venus
produces
another
for
himself
until
it
is
under
his
nose
concurrently
wegg
perceives
a
pretty
little
dead
bird
lying
on
the
counter
with
its
head
drooping
on
one
side
against
the
rim
of
mr
venus
saucer
and
a
long
stiff
wire
piercing
its
breast
as
if
it
were
cock
robin
the
hero
of
the
ballad
and
mr
venus
were
the
sparrow
with
his
bow
and
arrow
and
mr
wegg
were
the
fly
with
his
little
eye
mr
venus
dives
and
produces
another
muffin
yet
untoasted
taking
the
arrow
out
of
the
breast
of
cock
robin
he
proceeds
to
toast
it
on
the
end
of
that
cruel
instrument
when
it
is
brown
he
dives
again
and
produces
butter
with
which
he
completes
his
work
mr
wegg
as
an
artful
man
who
is
sure
of
his
supper
presses
muffin
on
his
host
to
soothe
him
into
a
compliant
state
of
mind
or
as
one
might
say
to
grease
his
works
as
the
muffins
disappear
little
by
little
the
black
shelves
and
nooks
and
corners
begin
to
appear
and
mr
wegg
gradually
acquires
an
imperfect
notion
that
over
against
him
on
the
is
a
hindoo
baby
in
a
bottle
curved
up
with
his
big
head
tucked
under
him
as
he
would
instantly
throw
a
summersault
if
the
bottle
were
large
enough
when
he
deems
mr
venus
wheels
sufficiently
lubricated
mr
wegg
approaches
his
object
by
asking
as
he
lightly
taps
his
hands
together
to
express
an
undesigning
frame
of
mind
how
have
i
been
going
on
this
long
time
mr
venus
bad
says
mr
venus
uncompromisingly
am
i
still
at
home
asks
wegg
with
an
air
of
surprise
at
home
this
would
seem
to
be
secretly
agreeable
to
wegg
but
he
veils
his
feelings
and
observes
to
what
do
you
attribute
it
do
know
replies
venus
who
is
a
haggard
melancholy
man
speaking
in
a
weak
voice
of
querulous
complaint
what
to
attribute
it
mr
wegg
i
ca
work
you
into
a
miscellaneous
one
no
how
do
what
i
will
you
ca
be
got
to
fit
anybody
with
a
passable
knowledge
would
pick
you
out
at
a
look
and
say
no
go
do
match
but
hang
it
mr
venus
wegg
expostulates
with
some
little
irritation
ca
be
personal
and
peculiar
in
me
it
must
often
happen
with
miscellaneous
ones
ribs
i
grant
you
always
but
not
else
when
i
prepare
a
miscellaneous
one
i
know
beforehand
that
i
ca
keep
to
nature
and
be
miscellaneous
with
ribs
because
every
man
has
his
own
ribs
and
no
other
man
will
go
with
them
but
elseways
i
can
be
miscellaneous
i
have
just
sent
home
a
beauty
a
perfect
beauty
to
a
school
of
art
one
leg
belgian
one
leg
english
and
the
pickings
of
eight
other
people
in
it
talk
of
not
being
qualified
to
be
miscellaneous
by
rights
you
ought
to
be
mr
wegg
silas
looks
as
hard
at
his
one
leg
as
he
can
in
the
dim
light
and
after
a
pause
sulkily
opines
it
must
be
the
fault
of
the
other
people
or
how
do
you
mean
to
say
it
comes
about
he
demands
impatiently
do
know
how
it
comes
about
stand
up
a
minute
hold
the
light
mr
venus
takes
from
a
corner
by
his
chair
the
bones
of
a
leg
and
foot
beautifully
pure
and
put
together
with
exquisite
neatness
these
he
compares
with
mr
wegg
leg
that
gentleman
looking
on
as
if
he
were
being
measured
for
a
i
do
know
how
it
is
but
so
it
is
you
have
got
a
twist
in
that
bone
to
the
best
of
my
belief
i
never
saw
the
likes
of
you
mr
wegg
having
looked
distrustfully
at
his
own
limb
and
suspiciously
at
the
pattern
with
which
it
has
been
compared
makes
the
point
bet
a
pound
that
ai
an
english
one
easy
wager
when
we
run
so
much
into
foreign
no
it
belongs
to
that
french
gentleman
as
he
nods
towards
a
point
of
darkness
behind
mr
wegg
the
latter
with
a
slight
start
looks
round
for
french
gentleman
whom
he
at
length
descries
to
be
represented
in
a
very
workmanlike
manner
by
his
ribs
only
standing
on
a
shelf
in
another
corner
like
a
piece
of
armour
or
a
pair
of
stays
says
mr
wegg
with
a
sort
of
sense
of
being
introduced
dare
say
you
were
all
right
enough
in
your
own
country
but
i
hope
no
objections
will
be
taken
to
my
saying
that
the
frenchman
was
never
yet
born
as
i
should
wish
to
match
at
this
moment
the
greasy
door
is
violently
pushed
inward
and
a
boy
follows
it
who
says
after
having
let
it
slam
for
the
stuffed
canary
three
and
ninepence
returns
venus
you
got
the
money
the
boy
produces
four
shillings
mr
venus
always
in
exceedingly
low
spirits
and
making
whimpering
sounds
peers
about
for
the
stuffed
canary
on
his
taking
the
candle
to
assist
his
search
mr
wegg
observes
that
he
has
a
convenient
little
shelf
near
his
knees
exclusively
appropriated
to
skeleton
hands
which
have
very
much
the
appearance
of
wanting
to
lay
hold
of
him
from
these
mr
venus
rescues
the
canary
in
a
glass
case
and
shows
it
to
the
boy
he
whimpers
animation
on
a
twig
making
up
his
mind
to
hop
take
care
of
him
he
a
lovely
and
three
is
four
the
boy
gathers
up
his
change
and
has
pulled
the
door
open
by
a
leather
strap
nailed
to
it
for
the
purpose
when
venus
cries
out
him
come
back
you
young
villain
you
got
a
tooth
among
them
halfpence
was
i
to
know
i
got
it
you
giv
it
me
i
do
want
none
of
your
teeth
i
got
enough
of
my
own
so
the
boy
pipes
as
he
selects
it
from
his
change
and
throws
it
on
the
counter
sauce
me
in
the
wicious
pride
of
your
youth
mr
venus
retorts
pathetically
hit
me
because
you
see
i
down
i
low
enough
without
that
it
dropped
into
the
till
i
suppose
they
drop
into
everything
there
was
two
in
the
at
breakfast
time
molars
well
then
argues
the
boy
do
you
call
names
for
to
which
mr
venus
only
replies
shaking
his
shock
of
dusty
hair
and
winking
his
weak
eyes
sauce
me
in
the
wicious
pride
of
your
youth
do
hit
me
because
you
see
i
down
you
no
idea
how
small
you
come
out
if
i
had
the
articulating
of
you
this
consideration
seems
to
have
its
effect
on
the
boy
for
he
goes
out
grumbling
dear
me
dear
me
sighs
mr
venus
heavily
snuffing
the
candle
world
that
appeared
so
flowery
has
ceased
to
blow
you
casting
your
eye
round
the
shop
mr
wegg
let
me
show
you
a
light
my
working
bench
my
young
man
bench
a
wice
tools
bones
warious
skulls
warious

warious
everything
within

the

in
those

i
quite

human
warious
cats
articulated
english
baby

warious
mummied

warious
oh
dear
me
that
the
general
panoramic
view
having
so
held
and
waved
the
candle
as
that
all
these
heterogeneous
objects
seemed
to
come
forward
obediently
when
they
were
named
and
then
retire
again
mr
venus
despondently
repeats
dear
me
dear
me
resumes
his
seat
and
with
drooping
despondency
upon
him
falls
to
pouring
himself
out
more
tea
am
i
asks
mr
wegg
somewhere
in
the
back
shop
across
the
yard
sir
and
speaking
quite
candidly
i
wish
i
never
bought
you
of
the
hospital
porter
look
here
what
did
you
give
for
me
replies
venus
blowing
his
tea
his
head
and
face
peering
out
of
the
darkness
over
the
smoke
of
it
as
if
he
were
modernizing
the
old
original
rise
in
his
family
were
one
of
a
warious
lot
and
i
know
silas
puts
his
point
in
the
improved
form
of
will
you
take
for
me
replies
venus
still
blowing
his
tea
not
prepared
at
a
moment
notice
to
tell
you
mr
wegg
according
to
your
own
account
i
not
worth
much
wegg
reasons
persuasively
for
miscellaneous
working
in
i
grant
you
mr
wegg
but
you
might
turn
out
valuable
yet
as
a
here
mr
venus
takes
a
gulp
of
tea
so
hot
that
it
makes
him
choke
and
sets
his
weak
eyes
watering
a
monstrosity
if
you
excuse
me
repressing
an
indignant
look
indicative
of
anything
but
a
disposition
to
excuse
him
silas
pursues
his
point
think
you
know
me
mr
venus
and
i
think
you
know
i
never
bargain
mr
venus
takes
gulps
of
hot
tea
shutting
his
eyes
at
every
gulp
and
opening
them
again
in
a
spasmodic
manner
but
does
not
commit
himself
to
assent
have
a
prospect
of
getting
on
in
life
and
elevating
myself
by
my
own
independent
exertions
says
wegg
feelingly
i
should
like
i
tell
you
openly
i
should
not
like
under
such
circumstances
to
be
what
i
may
call
dispersed
a
part
of
me
here
and
a
part
of
me
there
but
should
wish
to
collect
myself
like
a
genteel
person
a
prospect
at
present
is
it
mr
wegg
then
you
have
got
the
money
for
a
deal
about
you
then
i
tell
you
what
i
do
with
you
i
hold
you
over
i
am
a
man
of
my
word
and
you
need
be
afraid
of
my
disposing
of
you
i
hold
you
over
that
a
promise
oh
dear
me
dear
me
fain
to
accept
his
promise
and
wishing
to
propitiate
him
mr
wegg
looks
on
as
he
sighs
and
pours
himself
out
more
tea
and
then
says
trying
to
get
a
sympathetic
tone
into
his
voice
seem
very
low
mr
venus
is
business
bad
was
so
good
your
hand
out
at
all
was
so
well
in
mr
wegg
i
not
only
first
in
the
trade
but
the
trade
you
may
go
and
buy
a
skeleton
at
the
west
end
if
you
like
and
pay
the
west
end
price
but
it
be
my
putting
together
i
as
much
to
do
as
i
can
possibly
do
with
the
assistance
of
my
young
man
and
i
take
a
pride
and
a
pleasure
in
it
mr
venus
thus
delivers
himself
his
right
hand
extended
his
smoking
saucer
in
his
left
hand
protesting
as
though
he
were
going
to
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
ai
a
state
of
things
to
make
you
low
mr
venus
wegg
i
know
it
ai
mr
wegg
not
to
name
myself
as
a
workman
without
an
equal
i
gone
on
improving
myself
in
my
knowledge
of
anatomy
till
both
by
sight
and
by
name
i
perfect
mr
wegg
if
you
was
brought
here
loose
in
a
bag
to
be
articulated
i
name
your
smallest
bones
blindfold
equally
with
your
largest
as
fast
as
i
could
pick
out
and
i
sort
all
and
sort
your
wertebrae
in
a
manner
that
would
equally
surprise
and
charm
you
remarks
silas
though
not
quite
so
readily
as
last
time
ai
a
state
of
things
to
be
low
not
for
you
to
be
low
about
leastways
wegg
i
know
it
ai
mr
wegg
i
know
it
ai
but
it
the
heart
that
lowers
me
it
is
the
heart
be
so
good
as
take
and
read
that
card
out
loud
silas
receives
one
from
his
hand
which
venus
takes
from
a
wonderful
litter
in
a
drawer
and
putting
on
his
spectacles
reads
mr
venus
go
on
preserver
of
animals
and
birds
go
on
articulator
of
human
it
with
a
groan
it
mr
wegg
i
and
a
bachelor
mr
wegg
i
love
her
mr
wegg
she
is
worthy
of
being
loved
by
a
potentate
here
silas
is
rather
alarmed
by
mr
venus
springing
to
his
feet
in
the
hurry
of
his
spirits
and
haggardly
confronting
him
with
his
hand
on
his
coat
collar
but
mr
venus
begging
pardon
sits
down
again
saying
with
the
calmness
of
despair
objects
to
the
business
she
know
the
profits
of
it
knows
the
profits
of
it
but
she
do
appreciate
the
art
of
it
and
she
objects
to
it
i
do
not
wish
she
writes
in
her
own
handwriting
to
regard
myself
nor
yet
to
be
regarded
in
that
boney
light
mr
venus
pours
himself
out
more
tea
with
a
look
and
in
an
attitude
of
the
deepest
desolation
so
a
man
climbs
to
the
top
of
the
tree
mr
wegg
only
to
see
that
there
no
when
he
up
there
i
sit
here
of
a
night
surrounded
by
the
lovely
trophies
of
my
art
and
what
have
they
done
for
me
ruined
me
brought
me
to
the
pass
of
being
informed
that
she
does
not
wish
to
regard
herself
nor
yet
to
be
regarded
in
that
boney
light
having
repeated
the
fatal
expressions
mr
venus
drinks
more
tea
by
gulps
and
offers
an
explanation
of
his
doing
so
lowers
me
when
i
equally
lowered
all
over
lethargy
sets
in
by
sticking
to
it
till
one
or
two
in
the
morning
i
get
oblivion
do
let
me
detain
you
mr
wegg
i
not
company
for
any
one
is
not
on
that
account
says
silas
rising
because
i
got
an
appointment
it
time
i
was
at
harmon
said
mr
venus
up
battle
bridge
way
mr
wegg
admits
that
he
is
bound
for
that
port
ought
to
be
in
a
good
thing
if
you
worked
yourself
in
there
there
lots
of
money
going
there
think
says
silas
you
should
catch
it
up
so
quick
and
know
about
it
wonderful
at
all
mr
wegg
the
old
gentleman
wanted
to
know
the
nature
and
worth
of
everything
that
was
found
in
the
dust
and
many
the
bone
and
feather
and
what
not
that
he
brought
to
me
now
oh
dear
me
dear
me
and
he
buried
quite
in
this
neighbourhood
you
know
over
yonder
mr
wegg
does
not
know
but
he
makes
as
if
he
did
by
responsively
nodding
his
head
he
also
follows
with
his
eyes
the
toss
of
head
as
if
to
seek
a
direction
to
over
yonder
took
an
interest
in
that
discovery
in
the
river
says
venus
she
had
written
her
cutting
refusal
at
that
time
i
got
up
there
never
mind
though
he
had
raised
the
candle
at
arm
length
towards
one
of
the
dark
shelves
and
mr
wegg
had
turned
to
look
when
he
broke
off
old
gentleman
was
well
known
all
round
here
there
used
to
be
stories
about
his
having
hidden
all
kinds
of
property
in
those
dust
mounds
i
suppose
there
was
nothing
in
probably
you
know
mr
wegg
in
says
wegg
who
has
never
heard
a
word
of
this
before
let
me
detain
you
good
night
the
unfortunate
mr
venus
gives
him
a
shake
of
the
hand
with
a
shake
of
his
own
head
and
drooping
down
in
his
chair
proceeds
to
pour
himself
out
more
tea
mr
wegg
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
as
he
pulls
the
door
open
by
the
strap
notices
that
the
movement
so
shakes
the
crazy
shop
and
so
shakes
a
momentary
flare
out
of
the
candle
as
that
the
babies
hindoo
african
and
british
the
warious
the
french
gentleman
the
green
cats
the
dogs
the
ducks
and
all
the
rest
of
the
collection
show
for
an
instant
as
if
paralytically
animated
while
even
poor
little
cock
robin
at
mr
venus
elbow
turns
over
on
his
innocent
side
next
moment
mr
wegg
is
stumping
under
the
gaslights
and
through
the
mud
chapter
mr
boffin
in
consultation
whosoever
had
gone
out
of
fleet
street
into
the
temple
at
the
date
of
this
history
and
had
wandered
disconsolate
about
the
temple
until
he
stumbled
on
a
dismal
churchyard
and
had
looked
up
at
the
dismal
windows
commanding
that
churchyard
until
at
the
most
dismal
window
of
them
all
he
saw
a
dismal
boy
would
in
him
have
beheld
at
one
grand
comprehensive
swoop
of
the
eye
the
managing
clerk
junior
clerk
clerk
conveyancing
clerk
chancery
clerk
every
refinement
and
department
of
clerk
of
mr
mortimer
lightwood
erewhile
called
in
the
newspapers
eminent
solicitor
mr
boffin
having
been
several
times
in
communication
with
this
clerkly
essence
both
on
its
own
ground
and
at
the
bower
had
no
difficulty
in
identifying
it
when
he
saw
it
up
in
its
dusty
eyrie
to
the
second
floor
on
which
the
window
was
situated
he
ascended
much
in
mind
by
the
uncertainties
besetting
the
roman
empire
and
much
regretting
the
death
of
the
amiable
pertinax
who
only
last
night
had
left
the
imperial
affairs
in
a
state
of
great
confusion
by
falling
a
victim
to
the
fury
of
the
praetorian
guards
morning
morning
said
mr
boffin
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
as
the
office
door
was
opened
by
the
dismal
boy
whose
appropriate
name
was
blight
in
lightwood
gave
you
an
appointment
sir
i
think
do
want
him
to
give
it
you
know
returned
mr
boffin
pay
my
way
my
boy
doubt
sir
would
you
walk
in
mr
lightwood
ai
in
at
the
present
moment
but
i
expect
him
back
very
shortly
would
you
take
a
seat
in
mr
lightwood
room
sir
while
i
look
over
our
appointment
book
young
blight
made
a
great
show
of
fetching
from
his
desk
a
long
thin
manuscript
volume
with
a
brown
paper
cover
and
running
his
finger
down
the
day
appointments
murmuring
aggs
mr
baggs
mr
caggs
mr
daggs
mr
faggs
mr
gaggs
mr
boffin
yes
sir
quite
right
you
are
a
little
before
your
time
sir
mr
lightwood
will
be
in
directly
not
in
a
hurry
said
mr
boffin
you
sir
i
take
the
opportunity
if
you
please
of
entering
your
name
in
our
callers
book
for
the
day
young
blight
made
another
great
show
of
changing
the
volume
taking
up
a
pen
sucking
it
dipping
it
and
running
over
previous
entries
before
he
wrote
as
alley
mr
balley
mr
calley
mr
dalley
mr
falley
mr
galley
mr
halley
mr
lalley
mr
malley
and
mr
boffin
system
here
eh
my
lad
said
mr
boffin
as
he
was
booked
sir
returned
the
boy
could
get
on
without
it
by
which
he
probably
meant
that
his
mind
would
have
been
shattered
to
pieces
without
this
fiction
of
an
occupation
wearing
in
his
solitary
confinement
no
fetters
that
he
could
polish
and
being
provided
with
no
that
he
could
carve
he
had
fallen
on
the
device
of
ringing
alphabetical
changes
into
the
two
volumes
in
question
or
of
entering
vast
numbers
of
persons
out
of
the
directory
as
transacting
business
with
mr
lightwood
it
was
the
more
necessary
for
his
spirits
because
being
of
a
sensitive
temperament
he
was
apt
to
consider
it
personally
disgraceful
to
himself
that
his
master
had
no
clients
long
have
you
been
in
the
law
now
asked
mr
boffin
with
a
pounce
in
his
usual
inquisitive
way
been
in
the
law
now
sir
about
three
years
have
been
as
good
as
born
in
it
said
mr
boffin
with
admiration
you
like
it
do
mind
it
much
returned
young
blight
heaving
a
sigh
as
if
its
bitterness
were
past
wages
do
you
get
what
i
could
wish
replied
young
blight
the
whole
that
you
could
wish
shillings
a
week
said
the
boy
how
long
might
it
take
you
now
at
a
average
rate
of
going
to
be
a
judge
asked
mr
boffin
after
surveying
his
small
stature
in
silence
the
boy
answered
that
he
had
not
yet
quite
worked
out
that
little
calculation
suppose
there
nothing
to
prevent
your
going
in
for
it
said
mr
boffin
the
boy
virtually
replied
that
as
he
had
the
honour
to
be
a
briton
who
never
never
never
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
his
going
in
for
it
yet
he
seemed
inclined
to
suspect
that
there
might
be
something
to
prevent
his
coming
out
with
it
a
couple
of
pound
help
you
up
at
all
asked
mr
boffin
on
this
head
young
blight
had
no
doubt
whatever
so
mr
boffin
made
him
a
present
of
that
sum
of
money
and
thanked
him
for
his
attention
to
his
mr
boffin
affairs
which
he
added
were
now
he
believed
as
good
as
settled
then
mr
boffin
with
his
stick
at
his
ear
like
a
familiar
spirit
explaining
the
office
to
him
sat
staring
at
a
little
bookcase
of
law
practice
and
law
reports
and
at
a
window
and
at
an
empty
blue
bag
and
at
a
stick
of
and
a
pen
and
a
box
of
wafers
and
an
apple
and
a
all
very
dusty
and
at
a
number
of
inky
smears
and
blots
and
at
an
pretending
to
be
something
legal
and
at
an
iron
box
labelled
harmon
estate
until
mr
lightwood
appeared
mr
lightwood
explained
that
he
came
from
the
proctor
with
whom
he
had
been
engaged
in
transacting
mr
boffin
affairs
they
seem
to
have
taken
a
deal
out
of
you
said
mr
boffin
with
commiseration
mr
lightwood
without
explaining
that
his
weariness
was
chronic
proceeded
with
his
exposition
that
all
forms
of
law
having
been
at
length
complied
with
will
of
harmon
deceased
having
been
proved
death
of
harmon
next
inheriting
having
been
proved
and
so
forth
court
of
chancery
having
been
moved
and
so
forth
he
mr
lightwood
had
now
the
gratification
honour
and
happiness
again
and
so
forth
of
congratulating
mr
boffin
on
coming
into
possession
as
residuary
legatee
of
upwards
of
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
standing
in
the
books
of
the
governor
and
company
of
the
bank
of
england
again
and
so
forth
what
is
particularly
eligible
in
the
property
mr
boffin
is
that
it
involves
no
trouble
there
are
no
estates
to
manage
no
rents
to
return
so
much
per
cent
upon
in
bad
times
which
is
an
extremely
dear
way
of
getting
your
name
into
the
newspapers
no
voters
to
become
parboiled
in
hot
water
with
no
agents
to
take
the
cream
off
the
milk
before
it
comes
to
table
you
could
put
the
whole
in
a
morning
and
take
it
with
you
to
say
to
the
rocky
mountains
inasmuch
as
every
man
concluded
mr
lightwood
with
an
indolent
smile
to
be
under
a
fatal
spell
which
obliges
him
sooner
or
later
to
mention
the
rocky
mountains
in
a
tone
of
extreme
familiarity
to
some
other
man
i
hope
you
excuse
my
pressing
you
into
the
service
of
that
gigantic
range
of
geographical
bores
without
following
this
last
remark
very
closely
mr
boffin
cast
his
perplexed
gaze
first
at
the
ceiling
and
then
at
the
carpet
he
remarked
do
know
what
to
say
about
it
i
am
sure
i
was
as
well
as
i
was
it
a
great
lot
to
take
care
of
dear
mr
boffin
then
do
take
care
of
it
said
that
gentleman
now
returned
mortimer
the
irresponsible
imbecility
of
a
private
individual
and
not
with
the
profundity
of
a
professional
adviser
i
should
say
that
if
the
circumstance
of
its
being
too
much
weighs
upon
your
mind
you
have
the
haven
of
consolation
open
to
you
that
you
can
easily
make
it
less
and
if
you
should
be
apprehensive
of
the
trouble
of
doing
so
there
is
the
further
haven
of
consolation
that
any
number
of
people
will
take
the
trouble
off
your
hands
i
do
quite
see
it
retorted
mr
boffin
still
perplexed
not
satisfactory
you
know
what
you
anything
satisfactory
mr
boffin
asked
mortimer
raising
his
eyebrows
used
to
find
it
so
answered
mr
boffin
with
a
wistful
look
i
was
foreman
at
the
bower
afore
it
was
the
bower
i
considered
the
business
very
satisfactory
the
old
man
was
a
awful
tartar
saying
it
i
sure
without
disrespect
to
his
memory
but
the
business
was
a
pleasant
one
to
look
after
from
before
daylight
to
past
dark
a
pity
said
mr
boffin
rubbing
his
ear
he
ever
went
and
made
so
much
money
it
would
have
been
better
for
him
if
he
had
so
given
himself
up
to
it
you
may
depend
upon
it
making
the
discovery
all
of
a
sudden
he
found
it
a
great
lot
to
take
care
of
mr
lightwood
coughed
not
convinced
speaking
of
satisfactory
pursued
mr
boffin
lord
save
us
when
we
come
to
take
it
to
pieces
bit
by
bit
where
the
satisfactoriness
of
the
money
as
yet
when
the
old
man
does
right
the
poor
boy
after
all
the
poor
boy
gets
no
good
of
it
he
gets
made
away
with
at
the
moment
when
he
lifting
as
one
may
say
the
cup
and
sarser
to
his
lips
mr
lightwood
i
will
now
name
to
you
that
on
behalf
of
the
poor
dear
boy
me
and
mrs
boffin
have
stood
out
against
the
old
man
times
out
of
number
till
he
has
called
us
every
name
he
could
lay
his
tongue
to
i
have
seen
him
after
mrs
boffin
has
given
him
her
mind
respecting
the
claims
of
the
affections
catch
off
mrs
bonnet
she
wore
in
general
a
black
straw
perched
as
a
matter
of
convenience
on
the
top
of
her
head
and
send
it
spinning
across
the
yard
i
have
indeed
and
once
when
he
did
this
in
a
manner
that
amounted
to
personal
i
should
have
given
him
a
rattler
for
himself
if
mrs
boffin
had
thrown
herself
betwixt
us
and
received
flush
on
the
temple
which
dropped
her
mr
lightwood
dropped
her
mr
lightwood
murmured
honour
mrs
boffin
head
and
heart
understand
i
name
this
pursued
mr
boffin
show
you
now
the
affairs
are
wound
up
that
me
and
mrs
boffin
have
ever
stood
as
we
were
in
christian
honour
bound
the
children
friend
me
and
mrs
boffin
stood
the
poor
girl
friend
me
and
mrs
boffin
stood
the
poor
friend
me
and
mrs
boffin
up
and
faced
the
old
man
when
we
momently
expected
to
be
turned
out
for
our
pains
as
to
mrs
boffin
said
mr
boffin
lowering
his
voice
might
wish
it
mentioned
now
fashionable
but
she
went
so
far
as
to
tell
him
in
my
presence
he
was
a
rascal
mr
lightwood
murmured
saxon
spirit
mrs
ancestors
bowmen
agincourt
and
cressy
last
time
me
and
mrs
boffin
saw
the
poor
boy
said
mr
boffin
warming
as
fat
usually
does
with
a
tendency
to
melt
was
a
child
of
seven
year
old
for
when
he
came
back
to
make
intercession
for
his
sister
me
and
mrs
boffin
were
away
overlooking
a
country
contract
which
was
to
be
sifted
before
carted
and
he
was
come
and
gone
in
a
single
hour
i
say
he
was
a
child
of
seven
year
old
he
was
going
away
all
alone
and
forlorn
to
that
foreign
school
and
he
come
into
our
place
situate
up
the
yard
of
the
present
bower
to
have
a
warm
at
our
fire
there
was
his
little
scanty
travelling
clothes
upon
him
there
was
his
little
scanty
box
outside
in
the
shivering
wind
which
i
was
going
to
carry
for
him
down
to
the
steamboat
as
the
old
man
would
hear
of
allowing
a
sixpence
mrs
boffin
then
quite
a
young
woman
and
pictur
of
a
rose
stands
him
by
her
kneels
down
at
the
fire
warms
her
two
open
hands
and
falls
to
rubbing
his
cheeks
but
seeing
the
tears
come
into
the
child
eyes
the
tears
come
fast
into
her
own
and
she
holds
him
round
the
neck
like
as
if
she
was
protecting
him
and
cries
to
me
i
give
the
wide
wide
world
i
would
to
run
away
with
him
i
do
say
but
what
it
cut
me
and
but
what
it
at
the
same
time
heightened
my
feelings
of
admiration
for
mrs
boffin
the
poor
child
clings
to
her
for
awhile
as
she
clings
to
him
and
then
when
the
old
man
calls
he
says
i
must
go
god
bless
you
and
for
a
moment
rests
his
heart
against
her
bosom
and
looks
up
at
both
of
us
as
if
it
was
in
pain
in
agony
such
a
look
i
went
aboard
with
him
i
gave
him
first
what
little
treat
i
thought
he
like
and
i
left
him
when
he
had
fallen
asleep
in
his
berth
and
i
came
back
to
mrs
boffin
but
tell
her
what
i
would
of
how
i
had
left
him
it
all
went
for
nothing
for
according
to
her
thoughts
he
never
changed
that
look
that
he
had
looked
up
at
us
two
but
it
did
one
piece
of
good
mrs
boffin
and
me
had
no
child
of
our
own
and
had
sometimes
wished
that
how
we
had
one
but
not
now
we
might
both
of
us
die
says
mrs
boffin
and
other
eyes
might
see
that
lonely
look
in
our
so
of
a
night
when
it
was
very
cold
or
when
the
wind
roared
or
the
rain
dripped
heavy
she
would
wake
sobbing
and
call
out
in
a
fluster
do
you
see
the
poor
face
o
shelter
the
poor
child
till
in
course
of
years
it
gently
wore
out
as
many
things
do
dear
mr
boffin
everything
wears
to
rags
said
mortimer
with
a
light
laugh
wo
go
so
far
as
to
say
everything
returned
mr
boffin
on
whom
his
manner
seemed
to
grate
there
some
things
that
i
never
found
among
the
dust
well
sir
so
mrs
boffin
and
me
grow
older
and
older
in
the
old
man
service
living
and
working
pretty
hard
in
it
till
the
old
man
is
discovered
dead
in
his
bed
then
mrs
boffin
and
me
seal
up
his
box
always
standing
on
the
table
at
the
side
of
his
bed
and
having
frequently
heerd
tell
of
the
temple
as
a
spot
where
dust
is
contracted
for
i
come
down
here
in
search
of
a
lawyer
to
advise
and
i
see
your
young
man
up
at
this
present
elevation
chopping
at
the
flies
on
the
with
his
penknife
and
i
give
him
a
hoy
not
then
having
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
and
by
that
means
come
to
gain
the
honour
then
you
and
the
gentleman
in
the
uncomfortable
under
the
little
archway
in
saint
churchyard
commons
observed
lightwood
understood
it
was
another
name
said
mr
boffin
pausing
you
know
best
then
you
and
doctor
scommons
you
go
to
work
and
you
do
the
thing
that
proper
and
you
and
doctor
take
steps
for
finding
out
the
poor
boy
and
at
last
you
do
find
out
the
poor
boy
and
me
and
mrs
boffin
often
exchange
the
observation
we
shall
see
him
again
under
happy
but
it
was
never
to
be
and
the
want
of
satisfactoriness
is
that
after
all
the
money
never
gets
to
him
it
gets
remarked
lightwood
with
a
languid
inclination
of
the
head
excellent
hands
gets
into
the
hands
of
me
and
mrs
boffin
only
this
very
day
and
hour
and
that
what
i
am
working
round
to
having
waited
for
this
day
and
hour
a
purpose
mr
lightwood
here
has
been
a
wicked
cruel
murder
by
that
murder
me
and
mrs
boffin
mysteriously
profit
for
the
apprehension
and
conviction
of
the
murderer
we
offer
a
reward
of
one
tithe
of
the
property
a
reward
of
ten
thousand
pound
boffin
it
too
much
lightwood
me
and
mrs
boffin
have
fixed
the
sum
together
and
we
stand
to
it
let
me
represent
to
you
returned
lightwood
now
with
professional
profundity
and
not
with
individual
imbecility
that
the
offer
of
such
an
immense
reward
is
a
temptation
to
forced
suspicion
forced
construction
of
circumstances
strained
accusation
a
whole
of
edged
tools
said
mr
boffin
a
little
staggered
the
sum
we
put
one
side
for
the
purpose
whether
it
shall
be
openly
declared
in
the
new
notices
that
must
now
be
put
about
in
our
names
your
name
mr
boffin
in
your
name
well
in
my
name
which
is
the
same
as
mrs
boffin
and
means
both
of
us
is
to
be
considered
in
drawing
up
but
this
is
the
first
instruction
that
i
as
the
owner
of
the
property
give
to
my
lawyer
on
coming
into
it
lawyer
mr
boffin
returned
lightwood
making
a
very
short
note
of
it
with
a
very
rusty
pen
the
gratification
of
taking
the
instruction
there
is
another
is
just
one
other
and
no
more
make
me
as
compact
a
little
will
as
can
be
reconciled
with
tightness
leaving
the
whole
of
the
property
to
my
beloved
wife
henerietty
boffin
sole
executrix
make
it
as
short
as
you
can
using
those
words
but
make
it
tight
at
some
loss
to
fathom
mr
boffin
notions
of
a
tight
will
lightwood
felt
his
way
beg
your
pardon
but
professional
profundity
must
be
exact
when
you
say
tight
mean
tight
mr
boffin
explained
so
and
nothing
can
be
more
laudable
but
is
the
tightness
to
bind
mrs
boffin
to
any
and
what
conditions
mrs
boffin
interposed
her
husband
what
are
you
thinking
of
what
i
want
is
to
make
it
all
hers
so
tight
as
that
her
hold
of
it
ca
be
loosed
freely
to
do
what
she
likes
with
hers
absolutely
repeated
mr
boffin
with
a
short
sturdy
laugh
i
should
think
so
it
would
be
handsome
in
me
to
begin
to
bind
mrs
boffin
at
this
time
of
day
so
that
instruction
too
was
taken
by
mr
lightwood
and
mr
lightwood
having
taken
it
was
in
the
act
of
showing
mr
boffin
out
when
mr
eugene
wrayburn
almost
jostled
him
in
the
consequently
mr
lightwood
said
in
his
cool
manner
me
make
you
two
known
to
one
another
and
further
signified
that
mr
wrayburn
was
counsel
learned
in
the
law
and
that
partly
in
the
way
of
business
and
partly
in
the
way
of
pleasure
he
had
imparted
to
mr
wrayburn
some
of
the
interesting
facts
of
mr
boffin
biography
said
eugene
though
he
did
look
so
know
mr
boffin
sir
thankee
returned
that
gentleman
how
do
you
like
the
law
not
particularly
returned
eugene
dry
for
you
eh
well
i
suppose
it
wants
some
years
of
sticking
to
before
you
master
it
but
there
nothing
like
work
look
at
the
bees
beg
your
pardon
returned
eugene
with
a
reluctant
smile
will
you
excuse
my
mentioning
that
i
always
protest
against
being
referred
to
the
bees
you
said
mr
boffin
object
on
principle
said
eugene
a
biped
a
what
asked
mr
boffin
a
creature
i
object
on
principle
as
a
creature
to
being
constantly
referred
to
insects
and
creatures
i
object
to
being
required
to
model
my
proceedings
according
to
the
proceedings
of
the
bee
or
the
dog
or
the
spider
or
the
camel
i
fully
admit
that
the
camel
for
instance
is
an
excessively
temperate
person
but
he
has
several
stomachs
to
entertain
himself
with
and
i
have
only
one
besides
i
am
not
fitted
up
with
a
convenient
cool
cellar
to
keep
my
drink
in
i
said
you
know
urged
mr
boffin
rather
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
bee
and
may
i
represent
to
you
that
it
injudicious
to
say
the
bee
for
the
whole
case
is
assumed
conceding
for
a
moment
that
there
is
any
analogy
between
a
bee
and
a
man
in
a
shirt
and
pantaloons
which
i
deny
and
that
it
is
settled
that
the
man
is
to
learn
from
the
bee
which
i
also
deny
the
question
still
remains
what
is
he
to
learn
to
imitate
or
to
avoid
when
your
friends
the
bees
worry
themselves
to
that
highly
fluttered
extent
about
their
sovereign
and
become
perfectly
distracted
touching
the
slightest
monarchical
movement
are
we
men
to
learn
the
greatness
of
or
the
littleness
of
the
court
circular
i
am
not
clear
mr
boffin
but
that
the
hive
may
be
satirical
all
events
they
work
said
mr
boffin
returned
eugene
disparagingly
work
but
do
you
think
they
overdo
it
they
work
so
much
more
than
they
need
they
make
so
much
more
than
they
can
eat
they
are
so
incessantly
boring
and
buzzing
at
their
one
idea
till
death
comes
upon
them
that
do
you
think
they
overdo
it
and
are
human
labourers
to
have
no
holidays
because
of
the
bees
and
am
i
never
to
have
change
of
air
because
the
bees
do
mr
boffin
i
think
honey
excellent
at
breakfast
but
regarded
in
the
light
of
my
conventional
schoolmaster
and
moralist
i
protest
against
the
tyrannical
humbug
of
your
friend
the
bee
with
the
highest
respect
for
you
said
mr
boffin
morning
but
the
worthy
mr
boffin
jogged
away
with
a
comfortless
impression
he
could
have
dispensed
with
that
there
was
a
deal
of
unsatisfactoriness
in
the
world
besides
what
he
had
recalled
as
appertaining
to
the
harmon
property
and
he
was
still
jogging
along
fleet
street
in
this
condition
of
mind
when
he
became
aware
that
he
was
closely
tracked
and
observed
by
a
man
of
genteel
appearance
then
said
mr
boffin
stopping
short
with
his
meditations
brought
to
an
abrupt
check
the
next
article
beg
your
pardon
mr
boffin
name
too
eh
how
did
you
come
by
it
i
do
know
you
sir
you
do
know
me
mr
boffin
looked
full
at
the
man
and
the
man
looked
full
at
him
said
mr
boffin
after
a
glance
at
the
pavement
as
if
it
were
made
of
faces
and
he
were
trying
to
match
the
man
do
know
you
am
nobody
said
the
stranger
not
likely
to
be
known
but
mr
boffin
wealth
that
got
about
already
has
it
muttered
mr
and
his
romantic
manner
of
acquiring
it
make
him
conspicuous
you
were
pointed
out
to
me
the
other
day
said
mr
boffin
should
say
i
was
a
disappintment
to
you
when
i
was
pinted
out
if
your
politeness
would
allow
you
to
confess
it
for
i
am
well
aware
i
am
not
much
to
look
at
what
might
you
want
with
me
not
in
the
law
are
you
sir
information
to
give
for
a
reward
sir
there
may
have
been
a
momentary
mantling
in
the
face
of
the
man
as
he
made
the
last
answer
but
it
passed
directly
i
do
mistake
you
have
followed
me
from
my
lawyer
and
tried
to
fix
my
attention
say
out
have
you
or
have
you
demanded
mr
boffin
rather
angry
have
you
you
will
allow
me
to
walk
beside
you
mr
boffin
i
will
tell
you
would
you
object
to
turn
aside
into
this
place
i
think
it
is
called
clifford
inn
where
we
can
hear
one
another
better
than
in
the
roaring
street
thought
mr
boffin
he
proposes
a
game
at
skittles
or
meets
a
country
gentleman
just
come
into
property
or
produces
any
article
of
jewellery
he
has
found
i
knock
him
down
with
this
discreet
reflection
and
carrying
his
stick
in
his
arms
much
as
punch
carries
his
mr
boffin
turned
into
clifford
inn
aforesaid
boffin
i
happened
to
be
in
chancery
lane
this
morning
when
i
saw
you
going
along
before
me
i
took
the
liberty
of
following
you
trying
to
make
up
my
mind
to
speak
to
you
till
you
went
into
your
lawyer
then
i
waited
outside
till
you
came
out
quite
sound
like
skittles
nor
yet
country
gentleman
nor
yet
jewellery
thought
mr
boffin
there
no
knowing
am
afraid
my
object
is
a
bold
one
i
am
afraid
it
has
little
of
the
usual
practical
world
about
it
but
i
venture
it
if
you
ask
me
or
if
you
ask
yourself
which
is
more
likely
what
emboldens
me
i
answer
i
have
been
strongly
assured
that
you
are
a
man
of
rectitude
and
plain
dealing
with
the
soundest
of
sound
hearts
and
that
you
are
blessed
in
a
wife
distinguished
by
the
same
qualities
information
is
true
of
mrs
boffin
anyhow
was
mr
answer
as
he
surveyed
his
new
friend
again
there
was
something
repressed
in
the
strange
man
manner
and
he
walked
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
though
conscious
for
all
that
of
mr
observation
and
he
spoke
in
a
subdued
voice
but
his
words
came
easily
and
his
voice
was
agreeable
in
tone
albeit
constrained
i
add
i
can
discern
for
myself
what
the
general
tongue
says
of
you
that
you
are
quite
unspoiled
by
fortune
and
not
uplifted
i
trust
you
will
not
as
a
man
of
an
open
nature
suspect
that
i
mean
to
flatter
you
but
will
believe
that
all
i
mean
is
to
excuse
myself
these
being
my
only
excuses
for
my
present
intrusion
much
thought
mr
boffin
must
be
coming
to
money
how
much
will
probably
change
your
manner
of
living
mr
boffin
in
your
changed
circumstances
you
will
probably
keep
a
larger
house
have
many
matters
to
arrange
and
be
beset
by
numbers
of
correspondents
if
you
would
try
me
as
your
secretary
what
cried
mr
boffin
with
his
eyes
wide
open
secretary
said
mr
boffin
under
his
breath
a
queer
thing
pursued
the
stranger
wondering
at
mr
boffin
wonder
you
would
try
me
as
your
man
of
business
under
any
name
i
know
you
would
find
me
faithful
and
grateful
and
i
hope
you
would
find
me
useful
you
may
naturally
think
that
my
immediate
object
is
money
not
so
for
i
would
willingly
serve
you
a
year
two
years
any
term
you
might
appoint
before
that
should
begin
to
be
a
consideration
between
us
do
you
come
from
asked
mr
boffin
come
returned
the
other
meeting
his
eye
many
countries
boffin
acquaintances
with
the
names
and
situations
of
foreign
lands
being
limited
in
extent
and
somewhat
confused
in
quality
he
shaped
his
next
question
on
an
elastic
model
any
particular
place
have
been
in
many
places
have
you
been
asked
mr
boffin
here
again
he
made
no
great
advance
for
the
reply
was
have
been
a
student
and
a
traveller
if
it
ai
a
liberty
to
plump
it
out
said
mr
boffin
do
you
do
for
your
living
have
mentioned
returned
the
other
with
another
look
at
him
and
a
smile
i
aspire
to
do
i
have
been
superseded
as
to
some
slight
intentions
i
had
and
i
may
say
that
i
have
now
to
begin
life
not
very
well
knowing
how
to
get
rid
of
this
applicant
and
feeling
the
more
embarrassed
because
his
manner
and
appearance
claimed
a
delicacy
in
which
the
worthy
mr
boffin
feared
he
himself
might
be
deficient
that
gentleman
glanced
into
the
mouldy
little
plantation
or
of
clifford
inn
as
it
was
that
day
in
search
of
a
suggestion
sparrows
were
there
cats
were
there
and
were
there
but
it
was
not
otherwise
a
suggestive
spot
this
time
said
the
stranger
producing
a
little
and
taking
out
a
card
have
not
mentioned
my
name
my
name
is
rokesmith
i
lodge
at
one
mr
wilfer
at
holloway
mr
boffin
stared
again
of
miss
bella
wilfer
said
he
landlord
has
a
daughter
named
bella
yes
no
doubt
now
this
name
had
been
more
or
less
in
mr
boffin
thoughts
all
the
morning
and
for
days
before
therefore
he
said
singular
too
unconsciously
staring
again
past
all
bounds
of
good
manners
with
the
card
in
his
hand
i
suppose
it
was
one
of
that
family
that
pinted
me
out
i
have
never
been
in
the
streets
with
one
of
them
me
talked
of
among
though
i
occupy
my
own
rooms
and
have
held
scarcely
any
communication
with
them
and
odder
said
mr
boffin
sir
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
know
what
to
say
to
you
nothing
returned
mr
rokesmith
me
to
call
on
you
in
a
few
days
i
am
not
so
unconscionable
as
to
think
it
likely
that
you
would
accept
me
on
trust
at
first
sight
and
take
me
out
of
the
very
street
let
me
come
to
you
for
your
further
opinion
at
your
leisure
fair
and
i
do
object
said
mr
boffin
it
must
be
on
condition
that
it
fully
understood
that
i
no
more
know
that
i
shall
ever
be
in
want
of
any
gentleman
as
secretary
it
was
secretary
you
said
was
it
again
mr
boffin
eyes
opened
wide
and
he
stared
at
the
applicant
from
head
to
foot
repeating
you
sure
it
was
secretary
are
you
am
sure
i
said
so
secretary
repeated
mr
boffin
meditating
upon
the
word
no
more
know
that
i
may
ever
want
a
secretary
or
what
not
than
i
do
that
i
shall
ever
be
in
want
of
the
man
in
the
moon
me
and
mrs
boffin
have
not
even
settled
that
we
shall
make
any
change
in
our
way
of
life
mrs
boffin
inclinations
certainly
do
tend
towards
fashion
but
being
already
set
up
in
a
fashionable
way
at
the
bower
she
may
not
make
further
alterations
however
sir
as
you
do
press
yourself
i
wish
to
meet
you
so
far
as
saying
by
all
means
call
at
the
bower
if
you
like
call
in
the
course
of
a
week
or
two
at
the
same
time
i
consider
that
i
ought
to
name
in
addition
to
what
i
have
already
named
that
i
have
in
my
employment
a
literary
man
with
a
wooden
leg
as
i
have
no
thoughts
of
parting
from
regret
to
hear
i
am
in
some
sort
anticipated
mr
rokesmith
answered
evidently
having
heard
it
with
surprise
perhaps
other
duties
might
arise
see
returned
mr
boffin
with
a
confidential
sense
of
dignity
to
my
literary
man
duties
they
clear
professionally
he
declines
and
he
falls
and
as
a
friend
he
drops
into
poetry
without
observing
that
these
duties
seemed
by
no
means
clear
to
mr
rokesmith
astonished
comprehension
mr
boffin
went
on
now
sir
i
wish
you
you
can
call
at
the
bower
any
time
in
a
week
or
two
it
not
above
a
mile
or
so
from
you
and
your
landlord
can
direct
you
to
it
but
as
he
may
not
know
it
by
its
new
name
of
boffin
bower
say
when
you
inquire
of
him
it
harmon
will
you
repeated
mr
rokesmith
seeming
to
have
caught
the
sound
imperfectly
how
do
you
spell
it
as
to
the
spelling
of
it
returned
mr
boffin
with
great
presence
of
mind
your
look
out
harmon
is
all
you
got
to
say
to
him
morning
morning
morning
and
so
departed
without
looking
back
chapter
mr
and
mrs
boffin
in
consultation
betaking
himself
straight
homeward
mr
boffin
without
further
let
or
hindrance
arrived
at
the
bower
and
gave
mrs
boffin
in
a
walking
dress
of
black
velvet
and
feathers
like
a
mourning
an
account
of
all
he
had
said
and
done
since
breakfast
brings
us
round
my
dear
he
then
pursued
the
question
we
left
unfinished
namely
whether
there
to
be
any
new
for
fashion
i
tell
you
what
i
want
noddy
said
mrs
boffin
smoothing
her
dress
with
an
air
of
immense
enjoyment
want
society
society
my
dear
cried
mrs
boffin
laughing
with
the
glee
of
a
child
no
good
my
being
kept
here
like
is
it
now
have
to
pay
to
see
my
dear
returned
her
husband
though
you
be
cheap
at
the
same
money
the
neighbours
is
welcome
to
see
you
for
nothing
it
do
answer
said
the
cheerful
mrs
boffin
we
worked
like
the
neighbours
we
suited
one
another
now
we
have
left
work
off
we
have
left
off
suiting
one
another
do
you
think
of
beginning
work
again
mr
boffin
hinted
of
the
question
we
have
come
into
a
great
fortune
and
we
must
do
what
right
by
our
fortune
we
must
act
up
to
it
mr
boffin
who
had
a
deep
respect
for
his
wife
intuitive
wisdom
replied
though
rather
pensively
suppose
we
must
never
been
acted
up
to
yet
and
consequently
no
good
has
come
of
it
said
mrs
boffin
to
the
present
time
mr
boffin
assented
with
his
former
pensiveness
as
he
took
his
seat
upon
his
settle
hope
good
may
be
coming
of
it
in
the
future
time
towards
which
what
your
views
old
lady
mrs
boffin
a
smiling
creature
broad
of
figure
and
simple
of
nature
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
and
with
buxom
creases
in
her
throat
proceeded
to
expound
her
views
say
a
good
house
in
a
good
neighbourhood
good
things
about
us
good
living
and
good
society
i
say
live
like
our
means
without
extravagance
and
be
happy
i
say
be
happy
too
assented
the
still
pensive
mr
boffin
exclaimed
mrs
boffin
laughing
and
clapping
her
hands
and
gaily
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
i
think
of
me
in
a
light
yellow
chariot
and
pair
with
silver
boxes
to
the
wheels
you
was
thinking
of
that
was
you
my
dear
cried
the
delighted
creature
with
a
footman
up
behind
with
a
bar
across
to
keep
his
legs
from
being
poled
and
with
a
coachman
up
in
front
sinking
down
into
a
seat
big
enough
for
three
of
him
all
covered
with
upholstery
in
green
and
white
and
with
two
bay
horses
tossing
their
heads
and
stepping
higher
than
they
trot
and
with
you
and
me
leaning
back
inside
as
grand
as
ninepence
my
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
mrs
boffin
clapped
her
hands
again
rocked
herself
again
beat
her
feet
upon
the
floor
and
wiped
the
tears
of
laughter
from
her
eyes
what
my
old
lady
inquired
mr
boffin
when
he
also
had
sympathetically
laughed
your
views
on
the
subject
of
the
bower
it
up
do
part
with
it
but
put
somebody
in
it
to
keep
it
other
views
said
mrs
boffin
coming
from
her
fashionable
sofa
to
his
side
on
the
plain
settle
and
hooking
her
comfortable
arm
through
his
i
think
and
i
really
have
been
thinking
early
and
late
of
the
disappointed
girl
her
that
was
so
cruelly
disappointed
you
know
both
of
her
husband
and
his
riches
do
you
think
we
might
do
something
for
her
have
her
to
live
with
us
or
something
of
that
sort
once
thought
of
the
way
of
doing
it
cried
mr
boffin
smiting
the
table
in
his
admiration
a
thinking
this
old
lady
is
and
she
do
know
how
she
does
it
neither
does
the
ingein
mrs
boffin
pulled
his
nearest
ear
in
acknowledgment
of
this
piece
of
philosophy
and
then
said
gradually
toning
down
to
a
motherly
strain
and
not
least
i
have
taken
a
fancy
you
remember
dear
little
john
harmon
before
he
went
to
school
over
yonder
across
the
yard
at
our
fire
now
that
he
is
past
all
benefit
of
the
money
and
it
come
to
us
i
should
like
to
find
some
orphan
child
and
take
the
boy
and
adopt
him
and
give
him
john
name
and
provide
for
him
somehow
it
would
make
me
easier
i
fancy
say
it
only
a
whim
i
do
say
so
interposed
her
husband
but
deary
if
you
did
should
be
a
beast
if
i
did
her
husband
interposed
again
as
much
as
to
say
you
agree
good
and
kind
of
you
and
like
you
deary
and
do
you
begin
to
find
it
pleasant
now
said
mrs
boffin
once
more
radiant
in
her
comely
way
from
head
to
foot
and
once
more
smoothing
her
dress
with
immense
enjoyment
you
begin
to
find
it
pleasant
already
to
think
that
a
child
will
be
made
brighter
and
better
and
happier
because
of
that
poor
sad
child
that
day
and
it
pleasant
to
know
that
the
good
will
be
done
with
the
poor
sad
own
money
and
it
pleasant
to
know
that
you
are
mrs
boffin
said
her
husband
it
been
a
pleasant
thing
to
know
this
many
and
many
a
year
it
was
ruin
to
mrs
boffin
aspirations
but
having
so
spoken
they
sat
side
by
side
a
hopelessly
unfashionable
pair
these
two
ignorant
and
unpolished
people
had
guided
themselves
so
far
on
in
their
journey
of
life
by
a
religious
sense
of
duty
and
desire
to
do
right
ten
thousand
weaknesses
and
absurdities
might
have
been
detected
in
the
breasts
of
both
ten
thousand
vanities
additional
possibly
in
the
breast
of
the
woman
but
the
hard
wrathful
and
sordid
nature
that
had
wrung
as
much
work
out
of
them
as
could
be
got
in
their
best
days
for
as
little
money
as
could
be
paid
to
hurry
on
their
worst
had
never
been
so
warped
but
that
it
knew
their
moral
straightness
and
respected
it
in
its
own
despite
in
a
constant
conflict
with
itself
and
them
it
had
done
so
and
this
is
the
eternal
law
for
evil
often
stops
short
at
itself
and
dies
with
the
doer
of
it
but
good
never
through
his
most
inveterate
purposes
the
dead
jailer
of
harmony
jail
had
known
these
two
faithful
servants
to
be
honest
and
true
while
he
raged
at
them
and
reviled
them
for
opposing
him
with
the
speech
of
the
honest
and
true
it
had
scratched
his
stony
heart
and
he
had
perceived
the
powerlessness
of
all
his
wealth
to
buy
them
if
he
had
addressed
himself
to
the
attempt
so
even
while
he
was
their
griping
taskmaster
and
never
gave
them
a
good
word
he
had
written
their
names
down
in
his
will
so
even
while
it
was
his
daily
declaration
that
he
mistrusted
all
mankind
and
sorely
indeed
he
did
mistrust
all
who
bore
any
resemblance
to
himself
he
was
as
certain
that
these
two
people
surviving
him
would
be
trustworthy
in
all
things
from
the
greatest
to
the
least
as
he
was
that
he
must
surely
die
mr
and
mrs
boffin
sitting
side
by
side
with
fashion
withdrawn
to
an
immeasurable
distance
fell
to
discussing
how
they
could
best
find
their
orphan
mrs
boffin
suggested
advertisement
in
the
newspapers
requesting
orphans
answering
annexed
description
to
apply
at
the
bower
on
a
certain
day
but
mr
boffin
wisely
apprehending
obstruction
of
the
neighbouring
thoroughfares
by
orphan
swarms
this
course
was
negatived
mrs
boffin
next
suggested
application
to
their
clergyman
for
a
likely
orphan
mr
boffin
thinking
better
of
this
scheme
they
resolved
to
call
upon
the
reverend
gentleman
at
once
and
to
take
the
same
opportunity
of
making
acquaintance
with
miss
bella
wilfer
in
order
that
these
visits
might
be
visits
of
state
mrs
boffin
equipage
was
ordered
out
this
consisted
of
a
long
old
horse
formerly
used
in
the
business
attached
to
a
chaise
of
the
same
period
which
had
long
been
exclusively
used
by
the
harmony
jail
poultry
as
the
favourite
of
several
discreet
hens
an
unwonted
application
of
corn
to
the
horse
and
of
paint
and
varnish
to
the
carriage
when
both
fell
in
as
a
part
of
the
boffin
legacy
had
made
what
mr
boffin
considered
a
neat
of
the
whole
and
a
driver
being
added
in
the
person
of
a
long
young
man
who
was
a
very
good
match
for
the
horse
left
nothing
to
be
desired
he
too
had
been
formerly
used
in
the
business
but
was
now
entombed
by
an
honest
jobbing
tailor
of
the
district
in
a
perfect
sepulchre
of
coat
and
gaiters
sealed
with
ponderous
buttons
behind
this
domestic
mr
and
mrs
boffin
took
their
seats
in
the
back
compartment
of
the
vehicle
which
was
sufficiently
commodious
but
had
an
undignified
and
alarming
tendency
in
getting
over
a
rough
crossing
to
hiccup
itself
away
from
the
front
compartment
on
their
being
descried
emerging
from
the
gates
of
the
bower
the
neighbourhood
turned
out
at
door
and
window
to
salute
the
boffins
among
those
who
were
ever
and
again
left
behind
staring
after
the
equipage
were
many
youthful
spirits
who
hailed
it
in
stentorian
tones
with
such
congratulations
as
with
the
dust
and
other
similar
compliments
these
the
young
man
took
in
such
ill
part
that
he
often
impaired
the
majesty
of
the
progress
by
pulling
up
short
and
making
as
though
he
would
alight
to
exterminate
the
offenders
a
purpose
from
which
he
only
allowed
himself
to
be
dissuaded
after
long
and
lively
arguments
with
his
employers
at
length
the
bower
district
was
left
behind
and
the
peaceful
dwelling
of
the
reverend
frank
milvey
was
gained
the
reverend
frank
abode
was
a
very
modest
abode
because
his
income
was
a
very
modest
income
he
was
officially
accessible
to
every
blundering
old
woman
who
had
incoherence
to
bestow
upon
him
and
readily
received
the
boffins
he
was
quite
a
young
man
expensively
educated
and
wretchedly
paid
with
quite
a
young
wife
and
half
a
dozen
quite
young
children
he
was
under
the
necessity
of
teaching
and
translating
from
the
classics
to
eke
out
his
scanty
means
yet
was
generally
expected
to
have
more
time
to
spare
than
the
idlest
person
in
the
parish
and
more
money
than
the
richest
he
accepted
the
needless
inequalities
and
inconsistencies
of
his
life
with
a
kind
of
conventional
submission
that
was
almost
slavish
and
any
daring
layman
who
would
have
adjusted
such
burdens
as
his
more
decently
and
graciously
would
have
had
small
help
from
him
with
a
ready
patient
face
and
manner
and
yet
with
a
latent
smile
that
showed
a
quick
enough
observation
of
mrs
boffin
dress
mr
milvey
in
his
little
charged
with
sounds
and
cries
as
though
the
six
children
above
were
coming
down
through
the
ceiling
and
the
roasting
leg
of
mutton
below
were
coming
up
through
the
floor
listened
to
mrs
boffin
statement
of
her
want
of
an
orphan
think
said
mr
milvey
you
have
never
had
a
child
of
your
own
mr
and
mrs
boffin
never
like
the
kings
and
queens
in
the
fairy
tales
i
suppose
you
have
wished
for
one
in
a
general
way
yes
mr
milvey
smiled
again
as
he
remarked
to
himself
kings
and
queens
were
always
wishing
for
children
it
occurring
to
him
perhaps
that
if
they
had
been
curates
their
wishes
might
have
tended
in
the
opposite
direction
think
he
pursued
had
better
take
mrs
milvey
into
our
council
she
is
indispensable
to
me
if
you
please
i
call
her
so
mr
milvey
called
my
dear
and
mrs
milvey
came
down
a
pretty
bright
little
woman
something
worn
by
anxiety
who
had
repressed
many
pretty
tastes
and
bright
fancies
and
substituted
in
their
stead
schools
soup
flannel
coals
and
all
the
cares
and
sunday
coughs
of
a
large
population
young
and
old
as
gallantly
had
mr
milvey
repressed
much
in
himself
that
naturally
belonged
to
his
old
studies
and
old
and
taken
up
among
the
poor
and
their
children
with
the
hard
crumbs
of
life
and
mrs
boffin
my
dear
whose
good
fortune
you
have
heard
of
mrs
milvey
with
the
most
unaffected
grace
in
the
world
congratulated
them
and
was
glad
to
see
them
yet
her
engaging
face
being
an
open
as
well
as
a
perceptive
one
was
not
without
her
husband
latent
smile
boffin
wishes
to
adopt
a
little
boy
my
dear
mrs
milvey
looking
rather
alarmed
her
husband
added
orphan
my
dear
said
mrs
milvey
reassured
for
her
own
little
boys
i
was
thinking
margaretta
that
perhaps
old
mrs
goody
grandchild
might
answer
the
purpose
my
dear
frank
i
do
think
that
would
do
no
the
smiling
mrs
boffin
feeling
it
incumbent
on
her
to
take
part
in
the
conversation
and
being
charmed
with
the
emphatic
little
wife
and
her
ready
interest
here
offered
her
acknowledgments
and
inquired
what
there
was
against
him
do
think
said
mrs
milvey
glancing
at
the
reverend
frank
and
i
believe
my
husband
will
agree
with
me
when
he
considers
it
again
that
you
could
possibly
keep
that
orphan
clean
from
snuff
because
his
grandmother
takes
so
many
ounces
and
drops
it
over
him
he
would
not
be
living
with
his
grandmother
then
margaretta
said
mr
milvey
frank
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
keep
her
from
mrs
house
and
the
more
there
was
to
eat
and
drink
there
the
oftener
she
would
go
and
she
is
an
inconvenient
woman
i
hope
it
not
uncharitable
to
remember
that
last
christmas
eve
she
drank
eleven
cups
of
tea
and
grumbled
all
the
time
and
she
is
not
a
grateful
woman
frank
you
recollect
her
addressing
a
crowd
outside
this
house
about
her
wrongs
when
one
night
after
we
had
gone
to
bed
she
brought
back
the
petticoat
of
new
flannel
that
had
been
given
her
because
it
was
too
short
true
said
mr
milvey
do
think
that
would
do
would
little
harrison
frank
remonstrated
his
emphatic
wife
has
no
grandmother
my
dear
but
i
do
think
mrs
boffin
would
like
an
orphan
who
squints
so
much
true
again
said
mr
milvey
becoming
haggard
with
perplexity
a
little
girl
would
do
my
dear
frank
mrs
boffin
wants
a
boy
true
again
said
mr
milvey
bocker
is
a
nice
thoughtfully
i
doubt
frank
mrs
milvey
hinted
after
a
little
hesitation
mrs
boffin
wants
an
orphan
quite
nineteen
who
drives
a
cart
and
waters
the
roads
mr
milvey
referred
the
point
to
mrs
boffin
in
a
look
on
that
smiling
lady
shaking
her
black
velvet
bonnet
and
bows
he
remarked
in
lower
spirits
true
again
am
sure
said
mrs
boffin
concerned
at
giving
so
much
trouble
if
i
had
known
you
would
have
taken
so
much
pains
sir
and
you
too
am
i
do
think
i
would
have
come
do
say
that
urged
mrs
milvey
do
say
that
assented
mr
milvey
we
are
so
much
obliged
to
you
for
giving
us
the
preference
which
mrs
milvey
confirmed
and
really
the
kind
conscientious
couple
spoke
as
if
they
kept
some
profitable
orphan
warehouse
and
were
personally
patronized
it
is
a
responsible
trust
added
mr
milvey
difficult
to
discharge
at
the
same
time
we
are
naturally
very
unwilling
to
lose
the
chance
you
so
kindly
give
us
and
if
you
could
afford
us
a
day
or
two
to
look
about
us
you
know
margaretta
we
might
carefully
examine
the
workhouse
and
the
infant
school
and
your
district
be
sure
said
the
emphatic
little
wife
have
orphans
i
know
pursued
mr
milvey
quite
with
the
air
as
if
he
might
have
added
stock
and
quite
as
anxiously
as
if
there
were
great
competition
in
the
business
and
he
were
afraid
of
losing
an
order
at
the
but
they
are
employed
by
relations
or
friends
and
i
am
afraid
it
would
come
at
last
to
a
transaction
in
the
way
of
barter
and
even
if
you
exchanged
blankets
for
the
child
or
books
and
firing
it
would
be
impossible
to
prevent
their
being
turned
into
liquor
accordingly
it
was
resolved
that
mr
and
mrs
milvey
should
search
for
an
orphan
likely
to
suit
and
as
free
as
possible
from
the
foregoing
objections
and
should
communicate
again
with
mrs
boffin
then
mr
boffin
took
the
liberty
of
mentioning
to
mr
milvey
that
if
mr
milvey
would
do
him
the
kindness
to
be
perpetually
his
banker
to
the
extent
of
note
or
so
to
be
expended
without
any
reference
to
him
he
would
be
heartily
obliged
at
this
both
mr
milvey
and
mrs
milvey
were
quite
as
much
pleased
as
if
they
had
no
wants
of
their
own
but
only
knew
what
poverty
was
in
the
persons
of
other
people
and
so
the
interview
terminated
with
satisfaction
and
good
opinion
on
all
sides
old
lady
said
mr
boffin
as
they
resumed
their
seats
behind
the
horse
and
man
made
a
very
agreeable
visit
there
we
try
wilfer
it
appeared
on
their
drawing
up
at
the
family
gate
that
to
try
wilfer
was
a
thing
more
easily
projected
than
done
on
account
of
the
extreme
difficulty
of
getting
into
that
establishment
three
pulls
at
the
bell
producing
no
external
result
though
each
was
attended
by
audible
sounds
of
scampering
and
rushing
within
at
the
fourth
tug
vindictively
administered
by
the
young
man
miss
lavinia
appeared
emerging
from
the
house
in
an
accidental
manner
with
a
bonnet
and
parasol
as
designing
to
take
a
contemplative
walk
the
young
lady
was
astonished
to
find
visitors
at
the
gate
and
expressed
her
feelings
in
appropriate
action
mr
and
mrs
boffin
growled
the
young
man
through
the
bars
of
the
gate
and
at
the
same
time
shaking
it
as
if
he
were
on
view
in
a
menagerie
been
here
half
an
hour
did
you
say
asked
miss
lavinia
and
mrs
boffin
returned
the
young
man
rising
into
a
roar
miss
lavinia
tripped
up
the
steps
to
the
tripped
down
the
steps
with
the
key
tripped
across
the
little
garden
and
opened
the
gate
to
walk
in
said
miss
lavinia
haughtily
servant
is
out
mr
and
mrs
boffin
complying
and
pausing
in
the
little
hall
until
miss
lavinia
came
up
to
show
them
where
to
go
next
perceived
three
pairs
of
listening
legs
upon
the
stairs
above
mrs
wilfer
legs
miss
legs
mr
george
sampson
legs
and
mrs
boffin
i
think
said
lavinia
in
a
warning
voice
strained
attention
on
the
part
of
mrs
wilfer
legs
of
miss
bella
legs
of
mr
george
sampson
legs
miss
you
step
this
way
down
these
stairs
i
let
ma
know
excited
flight
of
mrs
wilfer
legs
of
miss
bella
legs
of
mr
george
sampson
legs
after
waiting
some
quarter
of
an
hour
alone
in
the
family
which
presented
traces
of
having
been
so
hastily
arranged
after
a
meal
that
one
might
have
doubted
whether
it
was
made
tidy
for
visitors
or
cleared
for
blindman
buff
mr
and
mrs
boffin
became
aware
of
the
entrance
of
mrs
wilfer
majestically
faint
and
with
a
condescending
stitch
in
her
side
which
was
her
company
manner
me
said
mrs
wilfer
after
the
first
salutations
and
as
soon
as
she
had
adjusted
the
handkerchief
under
her
chin
and
waved
her
gloved
hands
what
am
i
indebted
for
this
honour
make
short
of
it
returned
mr
boffin
you
may
be
acquainted
with
the
names
of
me
and
mrs
boffin
as
having
come
into
a
certain
property
have
heard
sir
returned
mrs
wilfer
with
a
dignified
bend
of
her
head
such
being
the
case
i
dare
say
pursued
mr
boffin
while
mrs
boffin
added
confirmatory
nods
and
smiles
are
not
very
much
inclined
to
take
kindly
to
us
me
said
mrs
wilfer
unjust
to
visit
upon
mr
and
mrs
boffin
a
calamity
which
was
doubtless
a
dispensation
these
words
were
rendered
the
more
effective
by
a
serenely
heroic
expression
of
suffering
fairly
meant
i
am
sure
remarked
the
honest
mr
boffin
boffin
and
me
are
plain
people
and
we
do
want
to
pretend
to
anything
nor
yet
to
go
round
and
round
at
anything
because
always
a
straight
way
to
everything
consequently
we
make
this
call
to
say
that
we
shall
be
glad
to
have
the
honour
and
pleasure
of
your
daughter
acquaintance
and
that
we
shall
be
rejoiced
if
your
daughter
will
come
to
consider
our
house
in
the
light
of
her
home
equally
with
this
in
short
we
want
to
cheer
your
daughter
and
to
give
her
the
opportunity
of
sharing
such
pleasures
as
we
are
a
going
to
take
ourselves
we
want
to
brisk
her
up
and
brisk
her
about
and
give
her
a
change
it
said
the
mrs
boffin
let
be
comfortable
mrs
wilfer
bent
her
head
in
a
distant
manner
to
her
lady
visitor
and
with
majestic
monotony
replied
to
the
gentleman
me
i
have
several
daughters
which
of
my
daughters
am
i
to
understand
is
thus
favoured
by
the
kind
intentions
of
mr
boffin
and
his
lady
you
see
the
mrs
boffin
put
in
miss
bella
you
know
said
mrs
wilfer
with
a
severely
unconvinced
look
daughter
bella
is
accessible
and
shall
speak
for
herself
then
opening
the
door
a
little
way
simultaneously
with
a
sound
of
scuttling
outside
it
the
good
lady
made
the
proclamation
miss
bella
to
me
which
proclamation
though
grandly
formal
and
one
might
almost
say
heraldic
to
hear
was
in
fact
enunciated
with
her
maternal
eyes
reproachfully
glaring
on
that
young
lady
in
the
flesh
and
in
so
much
of
it
that
she
was
retiring
with
difficulty
into
the
small
closet
under
the
stairs
apprehensive
of
the
emergence
of
mr
and
mrs
boffin
avocations
of
my
husband
mrs
wilfer
explained
on
resuming
her
seat
him
fully
engaged
in
the
city
at
this
time
of
the
day
or
he
would
have
had
the
honour
of
participating
in
your
reception
beneath
our
humble
roof
pleasant
premises
said
mr
boffin
cheerfully
me
sir
returned
mrs
wilfer
correcting
him
is
the
abode
of
conscious
though
independent
poverty
finding
it
rather
difficult
to
pursue
the
conversation
down
this
road
mr
and
mrs
boffin
sat
staring
at
and
mrs
wilfer
sat
silently
giving
them
to
understand
that
every
breath
she
drew
required
to
be
drawn
with
a
rarely
paralleled
in
history
until
miss
bella
appeared
whom
mrs
wilfer
presented
and
to
whom
she
explained
the
purpose
of
the
visitors
am
much
obliged
to
you
i
am
sure
said
miss
bella
coldly
shaking
her
curls
i
doubt
if
i
have
the
inclination
to
go
out
at
all
mrs
wilfer
admonished
her
you
must
conquer
this
do
what
your
ma
says
and
conquer
it
my
dear
urged
mrs
boffin
we
shall
be
so
glad
to
have
you
and
because
you
are
much
too
pretty
to
keep
yourself
shut
up
with
that
the
pleasant
creature
gave
her
a
kiss
and
patted
her
on
her
dimpled
shoulders
mrs
wilfer
sitting
stiffly
by
like
a
functionary
presiding
over
an
interview
previous
to
an
execution
are
going
to
move
into
a
nice
house
said
mrs
boffin
who
was
woman
enough
to
compromise
mr
boffin
on
that
point
when
he
could
very
well
contest
it
we
are
going
to
set
up
a
nice
carriage
and
we
go
everywhere
and
see
everything
and
you
must
seating
bella
beside
her
and
patting
her
hand
must
feel
a
dislike
to
us
to
begin
with
because
we
could
help
it
you
know
my
dear
with
the
natural
tendency
of
youth
to
yield
to
candour
and
sweet
temper
miss
bella
was
so
touched
by
the
simplicity
of
this
address
that
she
frankly
returned
mrs
boffin
kiss
not
at
all
to
the
satisfaction
of
that
good
woman
of
the
world
her
mother
who
sought
to
hold
the
advantageous
ground
of
obliging
the
boffins
instead
of
being
obliged
youngest
daughter
lavinia
said
mrs
wilfer
glad
to
make
a
diversion
as
that
young
lady
reappeared
george
sampson
a
friend
of
the
family
the
friend
of
the
family
was
in
that
stage
of
tender
passion
which
bound
him
to
regard
everybody
else
as
the
foe
of
the
family
he
put
the
round
head
of
his
cane
in
his
mouth
like
a
stopper
when
he
sat
down
as
if
he
felt
himself
full
to
the
throat
with
affronting
sentiments
and
he
eyed
the
boffins
with
implacable
eyes
you
like
to
bring
your
sister
with
you
when
you
come
to
stay
with
us
said
mrs
boffin
course
we
shall
be
glad
the
better
you
please
yourself
miss
bella
the
better
you
please
us
my
consent
is
of
no
consequence
at
all
i
suppose
cried
miss
lavinia
said
her
sister
in
a
low
voice
the
goodness
to
be
seen
and
not
heard
i
wo
replied
the
sharp
lavinia
not
a
child
to
be
taken
notice
of
by
strangers
are
a
child
not
a
child
and
i
wo
be
taken
notice
of
bring
your
sister
indeed
said
mrs
wilfer
i
will
not
allow
you
to
utter
in
my
presence
the
absurd
suspicion
that
any
strangers
i
care
not
what
their
names
can
patronize
my
child
do
you
dare
to
suppose
you
ridiculous
girl
that
mr
and
mrs
boffin
would
enter
these
doors
upon
a
patronizing
errand
or
if
they
did
would
remain
within
them
only
for
one
single
instant
while
your
mother
had
the
strength
yet
remaining
in
her
vital
frame
to
request
them
to
depart
you
little
know
your
mother
if
you
presume
to
think
so
all
very
fine
lavinia
began
to
grumble
when
mrs
wilfer
repeated
i
will
not
allow
this
do
you
not
know
what
is
due
to
guests
do
you
not
comprehend
that
in
presuming
to
hint
that
this
lady
and
gentleman
could
have
any
idea
of
patronizing
any
member
of
your
family
i
care
not
which
you
accuse
them
of
an
impertinence
little
less
than
insane
mind
me
and
mrs
boffin
said
mr
boffin
smilingly
do
care
me
but
i
do
returned
mrs
wilfer
miss
lavinia
laughed
a
short
laugh
as
she
muttered
to
be
sure
i
require
my
audacious
child
proceeded
mrs
wilfer
with
a
withering
look
at
her
youngest
on
whom
it
had
not
the
slightest
effect
please
to
be
just
to
her
sister
bella
to
remember
that
her
sister
bella
is
much
sought
after
and
that
when
her
sister
bella
accepts
an
attention
she
considers
herself
to
be
conferring
as
much
honour
this
with
an
indignant
shiver
she
receives
but
here
miss
bella
repudiated
and
said
quietly
can
speak
for
myself
you
know
ma
you
need
bring
me
in
please
it
all
very
well
aiming
at
others
through
convenient
me
said
the
irrepressible
lavinia
spitefully
i
should
like
to
ask
george
sampson
what
he
says
to
it
sampson
proclaimed
mrs
wilfer
seeing
that
young
gentleman
take
his
stopper
out
and
so
darkly
fixing
him
with
her
eyes
as
that
he
put
it
in
again
sampson
as
a
friend
of
this
family
and
a
frequenter
of
this
house
is
i
am
persuaded
far
too
to
interpose
on
such
an
invitation
this
exaltation
of
the
young
gentleman
moved
the
conscientious
mrs
boffin
to
repentance
for
having
done
him
an
injustice
in
her
mind
and
consequently
to
saying
that
she
and
mr
boffin
would
at
any
time
be
glad
to
see
him
an
attention
which
he
handsomely
acknowledged
by
replying
with
his
stopper
unremoved
obliged
to
you
but
i
always
engaged
day
and
night
however
bella
compensating
for
all
drawbacks
by
responding
to
the
advances
of
the
boffins
in
an
engaging
way
that
easy
pair
were
on
the
whole
well
satisfied
and
proposed
to
the
said
bella
that
as
soon
as
they
should
be
in
a
condition
to
receive
her
in
a
manner
suitable
to
their
desires
mrs
boffin
should
return
with
notice
of
the
fact
this
arrangement
mrs
wilfer
sanctioned
with
a
stately
inclination
of
her
head
and
wave
of
her
gloves
as
who
should
say
demerits
shall
be
overlooked
and
you
shall
be
mercifully
gratified
poor
people
said
mr
boffin
turning
back
as
he
was
going
have
a
lodger
gentleman
mrs
wilfer
answered
qualifying
the
low
expression
occupies
our
first
floor
may
call
him
our
mutual
friend
said
mr
boffin
sort
of
a
fellow
is
our
mutual
friend
now
do
you
like
him
rokesmith
is
very
punctual
very
quiet
a
very
eligible
inmate
mr
boffin
explained
must
know
that
i
not
particularly
well
acquainted
with
our
mutual
friend
for
i
have
only
seen
him
once
you
give
a
good
account
of
him
is
he
at
home
rokesmith
is
at
home
said
mrs
wilfer
pointing
through
the
window
he
stands
at
the
garden
gate
waiting
for
you
perhaps
so
replied
mr
boffin
me
come
in
maybe
bella
had
closely
attended
to
this
short
dialogue
accompanying
mrs
boffin
to
the
gate
she
as
closely
watched
what
followed
are
you
sir
how
are
you
said
mr
boffin
is
mrs
boffin
mr
rokesmith
that
i
told
you
of
my
dear
she
gave
him
good
day
and
he
bestirred
himself
and
helped
her
to
her
seat
and
the
like
with
a
ready
hand
for
the
present
miss
bella
said
mrs
boffin
calling
out
a
hearty
parting
shall
meet
again
soon
and
then
i
hope
i
shall
have
my
little
john
harmon
to
show
you
mr
rokesmith
who
was
at
the
wheel
adjusting
the
skirts
of
her
dress
suddenly
looked
behind
him
and
around
him
and
then
looked
up
at
her
with
a
face
so
pale
that
mrs
boffin
cried
and
after
a
moment
the
matter
sir
can
you
show
her
the
dead
returned
mr
rokesmith
only
an
adopted
child
one
i
have
told
her
of
one
i
going
to
give
the
name
to
took
me
by
surprise
said
mr
rokesmith
it
sounded
like
an
omen
that
you
should
speak
of
showing
the
dead
to
one
so
young
and
blooming
now
bella
suspected
by
this
time
that
mr
rokesmith
admired
her
whether
the
knowledge
for
it
was
rather
that
than
suspicion
caused
her
to
incline
to
him
a
little
more
or
a
little
less
than
she
had
done
at
first
whether
it
rendered
her
eager
to
find
out
more
about
him
because
she
sought
to
establish
reason
for
her
distrust
or
because
she
sought
to
free
him
from
it
was
as
yet
dark
to
her
own
heart
but
at
most
times
he
occupied
a
great
amount
of
her
attention
and
she
had
set
her
attention
closely
on
this
incident
that
he
knew
it
as
well
as
she
she
knew
as
well
as
he
when
they
were
left
together
standing
on
the
path
by
the
garden
gate
are
worthy
people
miss
wilfer
you
know
them
well
asked
bella
he
smiled
reproaching
her
and
she
coloured
reproaching
herself
both
with
the
knowledge
that
she
had
meant
to
entrap
him
into
an
answer
not
true
when
he
said
know
of
them
he
told
us
he
had
seen
you
but
once
i
supposed
he
did
bella
was
nervous
now
and
would
have
been
glad
to
recall
her
question
thought
it
strange
that
feeling
much
interested
in
you
i
should
start
at
what
sounded
like
a
proposal
to
bring
you
into
contact
with
the
murdered
man
who
lies
in
his
grave
i
might
have
known
of
course
in
a
moment
should
have
known
that
it
could
not
have
that
meaning
but
my
interest
remains
the
in
a
meditative
state
miss
bella
was
received
by
the
irrepressible
lavinia
with
bella
at
last
i
hope
you
have
got
your
wishes
realized
by
your
boffins
you
be
rich
enough
now
with
your
boffins
you
can
have
as
much
flirting
as
you
like
at
your
boffins
but
you
wo
take
me
to
your
boffins
i
can
tell
you
you
and
your
boffins
too
quoth
mr
george
sampson
moodily
pulling
his
stopper
out
bella
mr
boffin
comes
any
more
of
his
nonsense
to
me
i
only
wish
him
to
understand
as
betwixt
man
and
man
that
he
does
it
at
his
per
and
was
going
to
say
peril
but
miss
lavinia
having
no
confidence
in
his
mental
powers
and
feeling
his
oration
to
have
no
definite
application
to
any
circumstances
jerked
his
stopper
in
again
with
a
sharpness
that
made
his
eyes
water
and
now
the
worthy
mrs
wilfer
having
used
her
youngest
daughter
as
a
for
the
edification
of
these
boffins
became
bland
to
her
and
proceeded
to
develop
her
last
instance
of
force
of
character
which
was
still
in
reserve
this
was
to
illuminate
the
family
with
her
remarkable
powers
as
a
physiognomist
powers
that
terrified
when
ever
let
loose
as
being
always
fraught
with
gloom
and
evil
which
no
inferior
prescience
was
aware
of
and
this
mrs
wilfer
now
did
be
it
observed
in
jealousy
of
these
boffins
in
the
very
same
moments
when
she
was
already
reflecting
how
she
would
flourish
these
very
same
boffins
and
the
state
they
kept
over
the
heads
of
her
boffinless
friends
their
manners
said
mrs
wilfer
say
nothing
of
their
appearance
i
say
nothing
of
the
disinterestedness
of
their
intentions
towards
bella
i
say
nothing
but
the
craft
the
secrecy
the
dark
deep
underhanded
plotting
written
in
mrs
boffin
countenance
make
me
shudder
as
an
incontrovertible
proof
that
those
baleful
attributes
were
all
there
mrs
wilfer
shuddered
on
the
spot
chapter
a
marriage
contract
there
is
excitement
in
the
veneering
mansion
the
mature
young
lady
is
going
to
be
married
powder
and
all
to
the
mature
young
gentleman
and
she
is
to

married
from
the

and
the

are
to
give
the
breakfast
the
analytical
who
objects
as
a
matter
of
principle
to
everything
that
occurs
on
the
premises
necessarily
objects
to
the
match
but
his
consent
has
been
dispensed
with
and
a

delivering
its
load
of
greenhouse
plants
at
the
door
in
order
that

may
be
crowned
with
flowers
the

the
mature
young

is
a

of

he
invests
his

he
goes
in
a
condescending
amateurish
way
into
the
city
attends
meetings
of
directors
and
has
to
do
with
traffic
in
shares
as
is
well
known
to
the

in
their

in

is
the

in

between

perhaps

never
produced
anything
sufficient
answer
to
all
shares
o
mighty
shares
to
set
those
blaring
images
so
high
and
to
cause
us
smaller
vermin
as
under
the
influence
of
henbane
or
opium
to
cry
out
night
and

us
of

scatter
it
for

ye
take
rank
among

of

and
fatten
on
us
while
the
loves
and
graces
have
been
preparing
this
torch
for
hymen
which
is
to
be
kindled
mr
twemlow
has
suffered
much
in
his
mind
it
would
seem
that
both
the
mature
young
lady
and
the
mature
young
gentleman
must
indubitably
be
veneering
oldest
friends
wards
of
his
perhaps
yet
that
can
scarcely
be
for
they
are
older
than
himself
veneering
has
been
in
their
confidence
throughout
and
has
done
much
to
lure
them
to
the
altar
he
has
mentioned
to
twemlow
how
he
said
to
mrs
veneering
this
must
be
a
match
he
has
mentioned
to
twemlow
how
he
regards
sophronia
akershem
the
mature
young
lady
in
the
light
of
a
sister
and
alfred
lammle
the
mature
young
gentleman
in
the
light
of
a
brother
twemlow
has
asked
him
whether
he
went
to
school
as
a
junior
with
alfred
he
has
answered
exactly
whether
sophronia
was
adopted
by
his
mother
he
has
answered
precisely
so
twemlow
hand
has
gone
to
his
forehead
with
a
lost
air
but
two
or
three
weeks
ago
twemlow
sitting
over
his
newspaper
and
over
his
and
weak
tea
and
over
the
in
duke
street
st
james
received
a
and
monogram
from
mrs
veneering
entreating
her
dearest
mr
if
not
particularly
engaged
that
day
to
come
like
a
charming
soul
and
make
a
fourth
at
dinner
with
dear
mr
podsnap
for
the
discussion
of
an
interesting
family
topic
the
last
three
words
doubly
underlined
and
pointed
with
a
note
of
admiration
and
twemlow
replying
engaged
and
more
than
delighted
goes
and
this
takes
place
dear
twemlow
says
veneering
ready
response
to
unceremonious
invitation
is
truly
kind
and
like
an
old
old
friend
you
know
our
dear
friend
podsnap
twemlow
ought
to
know
the
dear
friend
podsnap
who
covered
him
with
so
much
confusion
and
he
says
he
does
know
him
and
podsnap
reciprocates
apparently
podsnap
has
been
so
wrought
upon
in
a
short
time
as
to
believe
that
he
has
been
intimate
in
the
house
many
many
many
years
in
the
friendliest
manner
he
is
making
himself
quite
at
home
with
his
back
to
the
fire
executing
a
statuette
of
the
colossus
at
rhodes
twemlow
has
before
noticed
in
his
feeble
way
how
soon
the
veneering
guests
become
infected
with
the
veneering
fiction
not
however
that
he
has
the
least
notion
of
its
being
his
own
case
friends
alfred
and
sophronia
pursues
veneering
the
veiled
prophet
friends
alfred
and
sophronia
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
my
dear
fellows
are
going
to
be
married
as
my
wife
and
i
make
it
a
family
affair
the
entire
direction
of
which
we
take
upon
ourselves
of
course
our
first
step
is
to
communicate
the
fact
to
our
family
friends
thinks
twemlow
with
his
eyes
on
podsnap
there
are
only
two
of
us
and
he
the
other
did
hope
veneering
goes
on
have
had
lady
tippins
to
meet
you
but
she
is
always
in
request
and
is
unfortunately
engaged
thinks
twemlow
with
his
eyes
wandering
there
are
three
of
us
and
she
the
other
lightwood
resumes
veneering
you
both
know
is
out
of
town
but
he
writes
in
his
whimsical
manner
that
as
we
ask
him
to
be
bridegroom
best
man
when
the
ceremony
takes
place
he
will
not
refuse
though
he
does
see
what
he
has
to
do
with
it
thinks
twemlow
with
his
eyes
rolling
there
are
four
of
us
and
he
the
other
and
brewer
observes
veneering
you
also
know
i
have
not
asked
but
i
reserve
them
for
the
occasion
thinks
twemlow
with
his
eyes
shut
are
si
but
here
collapses
and
does
not
completely
recover
until
dinner
is
over
and
the
analytical
has
been
requested
to
withdraw
now
come
says
veneering
the
point
the
real
point
of
our
little
family
consultation
sophronia
having
lost
both
father
and
mother
has
no
one
to
give
her
away
her
away
yourself
says
podsnap
dear
podsnap
no
for
three
reasons
firstly
because
i
take
so
much
upon
myself
when
i
have
respected
family
friends
to
remember
secondly
because
i
am
not
so
vain
as
to
think
that
i
look
the
part
thirdly
because
anastatia
is
a
little
superstitious
on
the
subject
and
feels
averse
to
my
giving
away
anybody
until
baby
is
old
enough
to
be
married
would
happen
if
he
did
podsnap
inquires
of
mrs
veneering
dear
mr
podsnap
it
very
foolish
i
know
but
i
have
an
instinctive
presentiment
that
if
hamilton
gave
away
anybody
else
first
he
would
never
give
away
baby
thus
mrs
veneering
with
her
open
hands
pressed
together
and
each
of
her
eight
aquiline
fingers
looking
so
very
like
her
one
aquiline
nose
that
the
jewels
on
them
seem
necessary
for
distinction
sake
my
dear
podsnap
quoth
veneering
is
a
tried
friend
of
our
family
who
i
think
and
hope
you
will
agree
with
me
podsnap
is
the
friend
on
whom
this
agreeable
duty
almost
naturally
devolves
that
friend
saying
the
words
as
if
the
company
were
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
in
number
now
among
us
that
friend
is
twemlow
from
podsnap
friend
veneering
repeats
with
greater
firmness
our
dear
good
twemlow
and
i
can
not
sufficiently
express
to
you
my
dear
podsnap
the
pleasure
i
feel
in
having
this
opinion
of
mine
and
anastatia
so
readily
confirmed
by
you
that
other
equally
familiar
and
tried
friend
who
stands
in
the
proud
position
i
mean
who
proudly
stands
in
the
position
or
i
ought
rather
to
say
who
places
anastatia
and
myself
in
the
proud
position
of
himself
standing
in
the
simple
position
of
godfather
and
indeed
veneering
is
much
relieved
in
mind
to
find
that
podsnap
betrays
no
jealousy
of
twemlow
elevation
so
it
has
come
to
pass
that
the
is
strewing
flowers
on
the
rosy
hours
and
on
the
staircase
and
that
twemlow
is
surveying
the
ground
on
which
he
is
to
play
his
distinguished
part
he
has
already
been
to
the
church
and
taken
note
of
the
various
impediments
in
the
aisle
under
the
auspices
of
an
extremely
dreary
widow
who
opens
the
pews
and
whose
left
hand
appears
to
be
in
a
state
of
acute
rheumatism
but
is
in
fact
voluntarily
doubled
up
to
act
as
a
and
now
veneering
shoots
out
of
the
study
wherein
he
is
accustomed
when
contemplative
to
give
his
mind
to
the
carving
and
gilding
of
the
pilgrims
going
to
canterbury
in
order
to
show
twemlow
the
little
flourish
he
has
prepared
for
the
trumpets
of
fashion
describing
how
that
on
the
seventeenth
instant
at
st
james
church
the
reverend
blank
blank
assisted
by
the
reverend
dash
dash
united
in
the
bonds
of
matrimony
alfred
lammle
esquire
of
sackville
street
piccadilly
to
sophronia
only
daughter
of
the
late
horatio
akershem
esquire
of
yorkshire
also
how
the
fair
bride
was
married
from
the
house
of
hamilton
veneering
esquire
of
stucconia
and
was
given
away
by
melvin
twemlow
esquire
of
duke
street
st
james
second
cousin
to
lord
snigsworth
of
snigsworthy
park
while
perusing
which
composition
twemlow
makes
some
opaque
approach
to
perceiving
that
if
the
reverend
blank
blank
and
the
reverend
dash
dash
fail
after
this
introduction
to
become
enrolled
in
the
list
of
veneering
dearest
and
oldest
friends
they
will
have
none
but
themselves
to
thank
for
it
after
which
appears
sophronia
whom
twemlow
has
seen
twice
in
his
lifetime
to
thank
twemlow
for
counterfeiting
the
late
horatio
akershem
esquire
broadly
of
yorkshire
and
after
her
appears
alfred
whom
twemlow
has
seen
once
in
his
lifetime
to
do
the
same
and
to
make
a
pasty
sort
of
glitter
as
if
he
were
constructed
for
only
and
had
been
let
out
into
daylight
by
some
grand
mistake
and
after
that
comes
mrs
veneering
in
a
pervadingly
aquiline
state
of
figure
and
with
transparent
little
knobs
on
her
temper
like
the
little
transparent
knob
on
the
bridge
of
her
nose
out
by
worry
and
excitement
as
she
tells
her
dear
mr
twemlow
and
reluctantly
revived
with
curacoa
by
the
analytical
and
after
that
the
bridesmaids
begin
to
come
by
from
various
parts
of
the
country
and
to
come
like
adorable
recruits
enlisted
by
a
sergeant
not
present
for
on
arriving
at
the
veneering
depot
they
are
in
a
barrack
of
strangers
so
twemlow
goes
home
to
duke
street
st
james
to
take
a
plate
of
mutton
broth
with
a
chop
in
it
and
a
look
at
the
in
order
that
he
may
cut
in
at
the
right
place
and
he
is
low
and
feels
it
dull
over
the
livery
and
is
distinctly
aware
of
a
dint
in
his
heart
made
by
the
most
adorable
of
the
adorable
bridesmaids
for
the
poor
little
harmless
gentleman
once
had
his
fancy
like
the
rest
of
us
and
she
did
answer
as
she
often
does
not
and
he
thinks
the
adorable
bridesmaid
is
like
the
fancy
as
she
was
then
which
she
is
not
at
all
and
that
if
the
fancy
had
not
married
some
one
else
for
money
but
had
married
him
for
love
he
and
she
would
have
been
happy
which
they
would
have
been
and
that
she
has
a
tenderness
for
him
still
whereas
her
toughness
is
a
proverb
brooding
over
the
fire
with
his
dried
little
head
in
his
dried
little
hands
and
his
dried
little
elbows
on
his
dried
little
knees
twemlow
is
melancholy
adorable
to
bear
me
company
here
thinks
he
adorable
at
the
club
a
waste
a
waste
a
waste
my
twemlow
and
so
drops
asleep
and
has
galvanic
starts
all
over
him
betimes
next
morning
that
horrible
old
lady
tippins
relict
of
the
late
sir
thomas
tippins
knighted
in
mistake
for
somebody
else
by
his
majesty
king
george
the
third
who
while
performing
the
ceremony
was
graciously
pleased
to
observe
what
what
who
who
who
why
why
why
begins
to
be
dyed
and
varnished
for
the
interesting
occasion
she
has
a
reputation
for
giving
smart
accounts
of
things
and
she
must
be
at
these
people
early
my
dear
to
lose
nothing
of
the
fun
whereabout
in
the
bonnet
and
drapery
announced
by
her
name
any
fragment
of
the
real
woman
may
be
concealed
is
perhaps
known
to
her
maid
but
you
could
easily
buy
all
you
see
of
her
in
bond
street
or
you
might
scalp
her
and
peel
her
and
scrape
her
and
make
two
lady
tippinses
out
of
her
and
yet
not
penetrate
to
the
genuine
article
she
has
a
large
gold
has
lady
tippins
to
survey
the
proceedings
with
if
she
had
one
in
each
eye
it
might
keep
that
other
drooping
lid
up
and
look
more
uniform
but
perennial
youth
is
in
her
artificial
flowers
and
her
list
of
lovers
is
full
you
wretch
says
lady
tippins
turning
the
eyeglass
about
and
about
is
your
charge
the
bridegroom
you
my
honour
returns
mortimer
do
know
and
i
care
is
that
the
way
you
do
your
duty
an
impression
that
he
is
to
sit
upon
my
knee
and
be
seconded
at
some
point
of
the
solemnities
like
a
principal
at
a
prizefight
i
assure
you
i
have
no
notion
what
my
duty
is
returns
mortimer
eugene
is
also
in
attendance
with
a
pervading
air
upon
him
of
having
presupposed
the
ceremony
to
be
a
funeral
and
of
being
disappointed
the
scene
is
the
of
st
james
church
with
a
number
of
leathery
old
registers
on
shelves
that
might
be
bound
in
lady
tippinses
but
hark
a
carriage
at
the
gate
and
mortimer
man
arrives
looking
rather
like
a
spurious
mephistopheles
and
an
unacknowledged
member
of
that
gentleman
family
whom
lady
tippins
surveying
through
her
considers
a
fine
man
and
quite
a
catch

to

with

their

begin
to
contradict

before

and

analytical
in
course
of

achieving
what
he
feels
to
be
due
to
himself
in
bringing
to
a
dignified
conclusion
several
quarrels
he
has
on
hand
with
the
pastrycook
men
announces
breakfast
no
less
magnificent
than
tables
superb
all
the
camels
out
and
all
laden
splendid
cake
covered
with
cupids
silver
and
knots
splendid
bracelet
produced
by
veneering
before
going
down
and
clasped
upon
the
arm
of
bride
yet
nobody
seems
to
think
much
more
of
the
veneerings
than
if
they
were
a
tolerable
landlord
and
landlady
doing
the
thing
in
the
way
of
business
at
so
much
a
head
the
bride
and
bridegroom
talk
and
laugh
apart
as
has
always
been
their
manner
and
the
buffers
work
their
way
through
the
dishes
with
systematic
perseverance
as
has
always
been
their
manner
and
the
pokey
unknowns
are
exceedingly
benevolent
to
one
another
in
invitations
to
take
glasses
of
champagne
but
mrs
podsnap
arching
her
mane
and
rocking
her
grandest
has
a
far
more
deferential
audience
than
mrs
veneering
and
podsnap
all
but
does
the
honours
another
dismal
circumstance
is
that
veneering
having
the
captivating
tippins
on
one
side
of
him
and
the
bride
aunt
on
the
other
finds
it
immensely
difficult
to
keep
the
peace
for
medusa
besides
unmistakingly
glaring
petrifaction
at
the
fascinating
tippins
follows
every
lively
remark
made
by
that
dear
creature
with
an
audible
snort
which
may
be
referable
to
a
chronic
cold
in
the
head
but
may
also
be
referable
to
indignation
and
contempt
and
this
snort
being
regular
in
its
reproduction
at
length
comes
to
be
expected
by
the
company
who
make
embarrassing
pauses
when
it
is
falling
due
and
by
waiting
for
it
render
it
more
emphatic
when
it
comes
the
stoney
aunt
has
likewise
an
injurious
way
of
rejecting
all
dishes
whereof
lady
tippins
partakes
saying
aloud
when
they
are
proffered
to
her
no
no
not
for
me
take
it
away
as
with
a
set
purpose
of
implying
a
misgiving
that
if
nourished
upon
similar
meats
she
might
come
to
be
like
that
charmer
which
would
be
a
fatal
consummation
aware
of
her
enemy
lady
tippins
tries
a
youthful
sally
or
two
and
tries
the
but
from
the
impenetrable
cap
and
snorting
armour
of
the
stoney
aunt
all
weapons
rebound
powerless
another
objectionable
circumstance
is
that
the
pokey
unknowns
support
each
other
in
being
unimpressible
they
persist
in
not
being
frightened
by
the
gold
and
silver
camels
and
they
are
banded
together
to
defy
the
elaborately
chased
they
even
seem
to
unite
in
some
vague
utterance
of
the
sentiment
that
the
landlord
and
landlady
will
make
a
pretty
good
profit
out
of
this
and
they
almost
carry
themselves
like
customers
nor
is
there
compensating
influence
in
the
adorable
bridesmaids
for
having
very
little
interest
in
the
bride
and
none
at
all
in
one
another
those
lovely
beings
become
each
one
of
her
own
account
depreciatingly
contemplative
of
the
millinery
present
while
the
bridegroom
man
exhausted
in
the
back
of
his
chair
appears
to
be
improving
the
occasion
by
penitentially
contemplating
all
the
wrong
he
has
ever
done
the
difference
between
him
and
his
friend
eugene
being
that
the
latter
in
the
back
of
his
chair
appears
to
be
contemplating
all
the
wrong
he
would
like
to
do
particularly
to
the
present
company
in
which
state
of
affairs
the
usual
ceremonies
rather
droop
and
flag
and
the
splendid
cake
when
cut
by
the
fair
hand
of
the
bride
has
but
an
indigestible
appearance
however
all
the
things
indispensable
to
be
said
are
said
and
all
the
things
indispensable
to
be
done
are
done
including
lady
tippins
yawning
falling
asleep
and
waking
insensible
and
there
is
hurried
preparation
for
the
nuptial
journey
to
the
isle
of
wight
and
the
outer
air
teems
with
brass
bands
and
spectators
in
full
sight
of
whom
the
malignant
star
of
the
analytical
has
that
pain
and
ridicule
shall
befall
him
for
he
standing
on
the
doorsteps
to
grace
the
departure
is
suddenly
caught
a
most
prodigious
thump
on
the
side
of
his
head
with
a
heavy
shoe
which
a
buffer
in
the
hall
and
wild
of
aim
has
borrowed
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
from
the
pastrycook
porter
to
cast
after
the
departing
pair
as
an
auspicious
omen
so
they
all
go
up
again
into
the
gorgeous
all
of
them
flushed
with
breakfast
as
having
taken
scarlatina
sociably
and
there
the
combined
unknowns
do
malignant
things
with
their
legs
to
ottomans
and
take
as
much
as
possible
out
of
the
splendid
furniture
and
so
lady
tippins
quite
undetermined
whether
today
is
the
day
before
yesterday
or
the
day
after
or
the
week
after
next
fades
away
and
mortimer
lightwood
and
eugene
fade
away
and
twemlow
fades
away
and
the
stoney
aunt
goes
away
she
declines
to
fade
proving
rock
to
the
last
and
even
the
unknowns
are
slowly
strained
off
and
it
is
all
over
all
over
that
is
to
say
for
the
time
being
but
there
is
another
time
to
come
and
it
comes
in
about
a
fortnight
and
it
comes
to
mr
and
mrs
lammle
on
the
sands
at
shanklin
in
the
isle
of
wight
mr
and
mrs
lammle
have
walked
for
some
time
on
the
shanklin
sands
and
one
may
see
by
their
footprints
that
they
have
not
walked
arm
in
arm
and
that
they
have
not
walked
in
a
straight
track
and
that
they
have
walked
in
a
moody
humour
for
the
lady
has
prodded
little
spirting
holes
in
the
damp
sand
before
her
with
her
parasol
and
the
gentleman
has
trailed
his
stick
after
him
as
if
he
were
of
the
mephistopheles
family
indeed
and
had
walked
with
a
drooping
tail
you
mean
to
tell
me
then
sophronia
thus
he
begins
after
a
long
silence
when
sophronia
flashes
fiercely
and
turns
upon
him
put
it
upon
me
sir
i
ask
you
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
mr
lammle
falls
silent
again
and
they
walk
as
before
mrs
lammle
opens
her
nostrils
and
bites
her
mr
lammle
takes
his
gingerous
whiskers
in
his
left
hand
and
bringing
them
together
frowns
furtively
at
his
beloved
out
of
a
thick
gingerous
bush
i
mean
to
say
mrs
lammle
after
a
time
repeats
with
indignation
it
on
me
the
unmanly
disingenuousness
mr
lammle
stops
releases
his
whiskers
and
looks
at
her
what
mrs
lammle
haughtily
replies
without
stopping
and
without
looking
back
meanness
he
is
at
her
side
again
in
a
pace
or
two
and
he
retorts
is
not
what
you
said
you
said
disingenuousness
if
i
did
is
no
if
in
the
case
you
did
did
then
and
what
of
it
of
it
says
mr
lammle
you
the
face
to
utter
the
word
to
me
face
too
replied
mrs
lammle
staring
at
him
with
cold
scorn
how
dare
you
sir
utter
the
word
to
me
never
did
as
this
happens
to
be
true
mrs
lammle
is
thrown
on
the
feminine
resource
of
saying
do
care
what
you
uttered
or
did
not
utter
after
a
little
more
walking
and
a
little
more
silence
mr
lammle
breaks
the
latter
shall
proceed
in
your
own
way
you
claim
a
right
to
ask
me
do
i
mean
to
tell
you
do
i
mean
to
tell
you
what
you
are
a
man
of
property
you
married
me
on
false
pretences
be
it
next
comes
what
you
mean
to
say
do
you
mean
to
say
you
are
a
woman
of
property
you
married
me
on
false
pretences
you
were
so
dull
a
that
you
deceived
yourself
or
if
you
were
so
greedy
and
grasping
that
you
were
to
be
deceived
by
appearances
is
it
my
fault
you
adventurer
the
lady
demands
with
great
asperity
asked
veneering
and
he
told
me
you
were
rich
with
great
contempt
and
what
does
veneering
know
about
me
he
not
your
trustee
i
have
no
trustee
but
the
one
you
saw
on
the
day
when
you
fraudulently
married
me
and
his
trust
is
not
a
very
difficult
one
for
it
is
only
an
annuity
of
a
hundred
and
fifteen
pounds
i
think
there
are
some
odd
shillings
or
pence
if
you
are
very
particular
mr
lammle
bestows
a
by
no
means
loving
look
upon
the
partner
of
his
joys
and
sorrows
and
he
mutters
something
but
checks
himself
for
question
it
is
my
turn
again
mrs
lammle
what
made
you
suppose
me
a
man
of
property
made
me
suppose
you
so
perhaps
you
will
deny
that
you
always
presented
yourself
to
me
in
that
character
you
asked
somebody
too
come
mrs
lammle
admission
for
admission
you
asked
somebody
asked
veneering
veneering
knew
as
much
of
me
as
he
knew
of
you
or
as
anybody
knows
of
him
after
more
silent
walking
the
bride
stops
short
to
say
in
a
passionate
manner
never
will
forgive
the
veneerings
for
this
will
i
returns
the
bridegroom
with
that
they
walk
again
she
making
those
angry
spirts
in
the
sand
he
dragging
that
dejected
tail
the
tide
is
low
and
seems
to
have
thrown
them
together
high
on
the
bare
shore
a
gull
comes
sweeping
by
their
heads
and
flouts
them
there
was
a
golden
surface
on
the
brown
cliffs
but
now
and
behold
they
are
only
damp
earth
a
taunting
roar
comes
from
the
sea
and
the
rollers
mount
upon
one
another
to
look
at
the
entrapped
impostors
and
to
join
in
impish
and
exultant
gambols
you
pretend
to
believe
mrs
lammle
resumes
sternly
you
talk
of
my
marrying
you
for
worldly
advantages
that
it
was
within
the
bounds
of
reasonable
probability
that
i
would
have
married
you
for
yourself
there
are
two
sides
to
the
question
mrs
lammle
what
do
you
pretend
to
believe
you
first
deceive
me
and
then
insult
me
cries
the
lady
with
a
heaving
bosom
at
all
i
have
originated
nothing
the
question
was
yours
mine
the
bride
repeats
and
her
parasol
breaks
in
her
angry
hand
his
colour
has
turned
to
a
livid
white
and
ominous
marks
have
come
to
light
about
his
nose
as
if
the
finger
of
the
very
devil
himself
had
within
the
last
few
moments
touched
it
here
and
there
but
he
has
repressive
power
and
she
has
none
it
away
he
coolly
recommends
as
to
the
parasol
have
made
it
useless
you
look
ridiculous
with
it
whereupon
she
calls
him
in
her
rage
deliberate
villain
and
so
casts
the
broken
thing
from
her
as
that
it
strikes
him
in
falling
the
are
something
whiter
for
the
instant
but
he
walks
on
at
her
side
she
bursts
into
tears
declaring
herself
the
wretchedest
the
most
deceived
the
of
women
then
she
says
that
if
she
had
the
courage
to
kill
herself
she
would
do
it
then
she
calls
him
vile
impostor
then
she
asks
him
why
in
the
disappointment
of
his
base
speculation
he
does
not
take
her
life
with
his
own
hand
under
the
present
favourable
circumstances
then
she
cries
again
then
she
is
enraged
again
and
makes
some
mention
of
swindlers
finally
she
sits
down
crying
on
a
block
of
stone
and
is
in
all
the
known
and
unknown
humours
of
her
sex
at
once
pending
her
changes
those
aforesaid
marks
in
his
face
have
come
and
gone
now
here
now
there
like
white
steps
of
a
pipe
on
which
the
diabolical
performer
has
played
a
tune
also
his
livid
lips
are
parted
at
last
as
if
he
were
breathless
with
running
yet
he
is
not
get
up
mrs
lammle
and
let
us
speak
reasonably
she
sits
upon
her
stone
and
takes
no
heed
of
him
up
i
tell
you
raising
her
head
she
looks
contemptuously
in
his
face
and
repeats
tell
me
tell
me
forsooth
she
affects
not
to
know
that
his
eyes
are
fastened
on
her
as
she
droops
her
head
again
but
her
whole
figure
reveals
that
she
knows
it
uneasily
of
this
come
do
you
hear
get
up
yielding
to
his
hand
she
rises
and
they
walk
again
but
this
time
with
their
faces
turned
towards
their
place
of
residence
lammle
we
have
both
been
deceiving
and
we
have
both
been
deceived
we
have
both
been
biting
and
we
have
both
been
bitten
in
a
there
the
state
of
the
case
sought
me
out
let
us
have
done
with
that
we
know
very
well
how
it
was
why
should
you
and
i
talk
about
it
when
you
and
i
ca
disguise
it
to
proceed
i
am
disappointed
and
cut
a
poor
figure
i
no
one
one
and
i
was
coming
to
you
if
you
had
waited
a
moment
you
too
are
disappointed
and
cut
a
poor
figure
injured
figure
are
now
cool
enough
sophronia
to
see
that
you
ca
be
injured
without
my
being
equally
injured
and
that
therefore
the
mere
word
is
not
to
the
purpose
when
i
look
back
i
wonder
how
i
can
have
been
such
a
fool
as
to
take
you
to
so
great
an
extent
upon
trust
when
i
look
back
the
bride
cries
interrupting
when
you
look
back
you
wonder
how
you
can
have
been
you
excuse
the
word
certainly
with
so
much
such
a
fool
as
to
take
me
to
so
great
an
extent
upon
trust
but
the
folly
is
committed
on
both
sides
i
can
not
get
rid
of
you
you
can
not
get
rid
of
me
what
follows
and
misery
the
bride
bitterly
replies
do
know
a
mutual
understanding
follows
and
i
think
it
may
carry
us
through
here
i
split
my
discourse
give
me
your
arm
sophronia
into
three
heads
to
make
it
shorter
and
plainer
firstly
it
enough
to
have
been
done
without
the
mortification
of
being
known
to
have
been
done
so
we

secondly
we
owe

were

chapter
podsnappery
mr
podsnap
was
well
to
do
and
stood
very
high
in
mr
podsnap
opinion
beginning
with
a
good
inheritance
he
had
married
a
good
inheritance
and
had
thriven
exceedingly
in
the
marine
insurance
way
and
was
quite
satisfied
he
never
could
make
out
why
everybody
was
not
quite
satisfied
and
he
felt
conscious
that
he
set
a
brilliant
social
example
in
being
particularly
well
satisfied
with
most
things
and
above
all
other
things
with
himself
thus
happily
acquainted
with
his
own
merit
and
importance
mr
podsnap
settled
that
whatever
he
put
behind
him
he
put
out
of
existence
there
was
a
dignified
conclusiveness
not
to
add
a
grand
convenience
in
this
way
of
getting
rid
of
disagreeables
which
had
done
much
towards
establishing
mr
podsnap
in
his
lofty
place
in
mr
podsnap
satisfaction
do
want
to
know
about
it
i
do
choose
to
discuss
it
i
admit
it
mr
podsnap
had
even
acquired
a
peculiar
flourish
of
his
right
arm
in
often
clearing
the
world
of
its
most
difficult
problems
by
sweeping
them
behind
him
and
consequently
sheer
away
with
those
words
and
a
flushed
face
for
they
affronted
him
mr
podsnap
world
was
not
a
very
large
world
morally
no
nor
even
geographically
seeing
that
although
his
business
was
sustained
upon
commerce
with
other
countries
he
considered
other
countries
with
that
important
reservation
a
mistake
and
of
their
manners
and
customs
would
conclusively
observe
english
when
presto
with
a
flourish
of
the
arm
and
a
flush
of
the
face
they
were
swept
away
elsewise
the
world
got

to
those
same
vagrants
the
arts
on
pain
of
excommunication
nothing
else
to
be
anywhere
as
a
so
eminently
respectable
man
mr
podsnap
was
sensible
of
its
being
required
of
him
to
take
providence
under
his
protection
consequently
he
always
knew
exactly
what
providence
meant
inferior
and
less
respectable
men
might
fall
short
of
that
mark
but
mr
podsnap
was
always
up
to
it
and
it
was
very
remarkable
and
must
have
been
very
comfortable
that
what
providence
meant
was
invariably
what
mr
podsnap
meant
these
may
be
said
to
have
been
the
articles
of
a
faith
and
school
which
the
present
chapter
takes
the
liberty
of
calling
after
its
representative
man
podsnappery
they
were
confined
within
close
bounds
as
mr
podsnap
own
head
was
confined
by
his
and
they
were
enunciated
with
a
sounding
pomp
that
smacked
of
the
creaking
of
mr
podsnap
own
boots
there
was
a
miss
podsnap
and
this
young
was
being
trained
in
her
mother
art
of
prancing
in
a
stately
manner
without
ever
getting
on
but
the
high
parental
action
was
not
yet
imparted
to
her
and
in
truth
she
was
but
an
undersized
damsel
with
high
shoulders
low
spirits
chilled
elbows
and
a
rasped
surface
of
nose
who
seemed
to
take
occasional
frosty
peeps
out
of
childhood
into
womanhood
and
to
shrink
back
again
overcome
by
her
mother
and
her
father
from
head
to
foot
crushed
by
the
mere
of
podsnappery
a
certain
institution
in
mr
podsnap
mind
which
he
called
young
person
may
be
considered
to
have
been
embodied
in
miss
podsnap
his
daughter
it
was
an
inconvenient
and
exacting
institution
as
requiring
everything
in
the
universe
to
be
filed
down
and
fitted
to
it
the
question
about
everything
was
would
it
bring
a
blush
into
the
cheek
of
the
young
person
and
the
inconvenience
of
the
young
person
was
that
according
to
mr
podsnap
she
seemed
always
liable
to
burst
into
blushes
when
there
was
no
need
at
all
there
appeared
to
be
no
line
of
demarcation
between
the
young
person
excessive
innocence
and
another
person
guiltiest
knowledge
take
mr
podsnap
word
for
it
and
the
soberest
tints
of
drab
white
lilac
and
grey
were
all
flaming
red
to
this
troublesome
bull
of
a
young
person
the
podsnaps
lived
in
a
shady
angle
adjoining
portman
square
they
were
a
kind
of
people
certain
to
dwell
in
the
shade
wherever
they
dwelt
miss
podsnap
life
had
been
from
her
first
appearance
on
this
planet
altogether
of
a
shady
order
for
mr
podsnap
young
person
was
likely
to
get
little
good
out
of
association
with
other
young
persons
and
had
therefore
been
restricted
to
companionship
with
not
very
congenial
older
persons
and
with
massive
furniture
miss
podsnap
early
views
of
life
being
principally
derived
from
the
reflections
of
it
in
her
boots
and
in
the
walnut
and
rosewood
tables
of
the
dim
and
in
their
swarthy
giants
of
were
of
a
sombre
cast
and
it
was
not
wonderful
that
now
when
she
was
on
most
days
solemnly
tooled
through
the
park
by
the
side
of
her
mother
in
a
great
tall
phaeton
she
showed
above
the
apron
of
that
vehicle
like
a
dejected
young
person
sitting
up
in
bed
to
take
a
startled
look
at
things
in
general
and
very
strongly
desiring
to
get
her
head
under
the
counterpane
again
said
mr
podsnap
to
mrs
podsnap
is
almost
eighteen
said
mrs
podsnap
to
mr
podsnap
assenting
eighteen
said
mr
podsnap
then
to
mrs
podsnap
i
think
we
should
have
some
people
on
georgiana
birthday
said
mrs
podsnap
then
to
mr
podsnap
will
enable
us
to
clear
off
all
those
people
who
are
due
so
it
came
to
pass
that
mr
and
mrs
podsnap
requested
the
honour
of
the
company
of
seventeen
friends
of
their
souls
at
dinner
and
that
they
substituted
other
friends
of
their
souls
for
such
of
the
seventeen
original
friends
of
their
souls
as
deeply
regretted
that
a
prior
engagement
prevented
their
having
the
honour
of
dining
with
mr
and
mrs
podsnap
in
pursuance
of
their
kind
invitation
and
that
mrs
podsnap
said
of
all
these
inconsolable
personages
as
she
checked
them
off
with
a
pencil
in
her
list
at
any
rate
and
got
rid
of
and
that
they
successfully
disposed
of
a
good
many
friends
of
their
souls
in
this
way
and
felt
their
consciences
much
lightened
there
were
still
other
friends
of
their
souls
who
were
not
entitled
to
be
asked
to
dinner
but
had
a
claim
to
be
invited
to
come
and
take
a
haunch
of
mutton
at
nine
for
the
clearing
off
of
these
worthies
mrs
podsnap
added
a
small
and
early
evening
to
the
dinner
and
looked
in
at
the
to
bespeak
a
automaton
to
come
and
play
quadrilles
for
a
carpet
dance
mr
and
mrs
veneering
and
mr
and
mrs
veneering
bride
and
bridegroom
were
of
the
dinner
company
but
the
podsnap
establishment
had
nothing
else
in
common
with
the
veneerings
mr
podsnap
could
tolerate
taste
in
a
mushroom
man
who
stood
in
need
of
that
sort
of
thing
but
was
far
above
it
himself
hideous
solidity
was
the
characteristic
of
the
podsnap
plate
everything
was
made
to
look
as
heavy
as
it
could
and
to
take
up
as
much
room
as
possible
everything
said
boastfully
you
have
as
much
of
me
in
my
ugliness
as
if
i
were
only
lead
but
i
am
so
many
ounces
of
precious
metal
worth
so
much
an
ounce
would
you
like
to
melt
me
down
a
corpulent
straddling
epergne
blotched
all
over
as
if
it
had
broken
out
in
an
eruption
rather
than
been
ornamented
delivered
this
address
from
an
unsightly
silver
platform
in
the
centre
of
the
table
four
silver
each
furnished
with
four
staring
heads
each
head
obtrusively
carrying
a
big
silver
ring
in
each
of
its
ears
conveyed
the
sentiment
up
and
down
the
table
and
handed
it
on
to
the
silver
all
the
big
silver
spoons
and
forks
widened
the
mouths
of
the
company
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
thrusting
the
sentiment
down
their
throats
with
every
morsel
they
ate
the
majority
of
the
guests
were
like
the
plate
and
included
several
heavy
articles
weighing
ever
so
much
but
there
was
a
foreign
gentleman
among
them
whom
mr
podsnap
had
invited
after
much
debate
with
himself
believing
the
whole
european
continent
to
be
in
mortal
alliance
against
the
young
person
and
there
was
a
droll
disposition
not
only
on
the
part
of
mr
podsnap
but
of
everybody
else
to
treat
him
as
if
he
were
a
child
who
was
hard
of
hearing
as
a
delicate
concession
to
this
foreigner
mr
podsnap
in
receiving
him
had
presented
his
wife
as
podsnap
also
his
daughter
as
podsnap
with
some
inclination
to
add
fille
in
which
bold
venture
however
he
checked
himself
the
veneerings
being
at
that
time
the
only
other
arrivals
he
had
added
in
a
condescendingly
explanatory
manner
and
had
then
subsided
into
english
do
you
like
london
mr
podsnap
now
inquired
from
his
station
of
host
as
if
he
were
administering
something
in
the
nature
of
a
powder
or
potion
to
the
deaf
child
londres
london
the
foreign
gentleman
admired
it
find
it
very
large
said
mr
podsnap
spaciously
the
foreign
gentleman
found
it
very
large
very
rich
the
foreign
gentleman
found
it
without
doubt
enormement
riche
rich
we
say
returned
mr
podsnap
in
a
condescending
manner
english
adverbs
do
not
terminate
in
mong
and
we
pronounce
the
ch
as
if
there
were
a
t
before
it
we
say
ritch
remarked
the
foreign
gentleman
do
you
find
sir
pursued
mr
podsnap
with
dignity
evidences
that
strike
you
of
our
british
constitution
in
the
streets
of
the
world
metropolis
london
londres
london
the
foreign
gentleman
begged
to
be
pardoned
but
did
not
altogether
understand
constitution
britannique
mr
podsnap
explained
as
if
he
were
teaching
in
an
infant
school
say
british
but
you
say
britannique
you
know
forgivingly
as
if
that
were
not
his
fault
constitution
sir
the
foreign
gentleman
said
yees
i
know
eem
a
youngish
sallowish
gentleman
in
spectacles
with
a
lumpy
forehead
seated
in
a
supplementary
chair
at
a
corner
of
the
table
here
caused
a
profound
sensation
by
saying
in
a
raised
voice
and
then
stopping
dead
oui
said
the
foreign
gentleman
turning
towards
him
que
quoi
donc
but
the
gentleman
with
the
lumpy
forehead
having
for
the
time
delivered
himself
of
all
that
he
found
behind
his
lumps
spake
for
the
time
no
more
was
inquiring
said
mr
podsnap
resuming
the
thread
of
his
discourse
you
have
observed
in
our
streets
as
we
should
say
upon
our
pavvy
as
you
would
say
any
tokens
the
foreign
gentleman
with
patient
courtesy
entreated
pardon
what
was
tokenz
said
mr
podsnap
you
know
appearances
traces
of
a
orse
inquired
the
foreign
gentleman
call
it
horse
said
mr
podsnap
with
forbearance
england
angleterre
england
we
aspirate
the
h
and
we
say
only
our
lower
classes
say
orse
said
the
foreign
gentleman
am
alwiz
wrong
language
said
mr
podsnap
with
a
gracious
consciousness
of
being
always
right
difficult
ours
is
a
copious
language
and
trying
to
strangers
i
will
not
pursue
my
question
but
the
lumpy
gentleman
unwilling
to
give
it
up
again
madly
said
and
again
spake
no
more
merely
referred
mr
podsnap
explained
with
a
sense
of
meritorious
proprietorship
our
constitution
sir
we
englishmen
are
very
proud
of
our
constitution
sir
it
was
bestowed
upon
us
by
providence
no
other
country
is
so
favoured
as
this
country
ozer
countries
the
foreign
gentleman
was
beginning
when
mr
podsnap
put
him
right
again
do
not
say
ozer
we
say
other
the
letters
are
t
and
h
you
say
tay
and
aish
you
know
still
with
clemency
the
sound
is
th
th
other
countries
said
the
foreign
gentleman
do
how
do
sir
returned
mr
podsnap
gravely
shaking
his
head
do
i
am
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
say
it
as
they
do
was
a
little
particular
of
providence
said
the
foreign
gentleman
laughing
the
frontier
is
not
large
assented
mr
podsnap
so
it
is
it
was
the
charter
of
the
land
this
island
was
blest
sir
to
the
direct
exclusion
of
such
other
countries
as
as
there
may
happen
to
be
and
if
we
were
all
englishmen
present
i
would
say
added
mr
podsnap
looking
round
upon
his
compatriots
and
sounding
solemnly
with
his
theme
there
is
in
the
englishman
a
combination
of
qualities
a
modesty
an
independence
a
responsibility
a
repose
combined
with
an
absence
of
everything
calculated
to
call
a
blush
into
the
cheek
of
a
young
person
which
one
would
seek
in
vain
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
having
delivered
this
little
summary
mr
podsnap
face
flushed
as
he
thought
of
the
remote
possibility
of
its
being
at
all
qualified
by
any
prejudiced
citizen
of
any
other
country
and
with
his
favourite
flourish
he
put
the
rest
of
europe
and
the
whole
of
asia
africa
and
america
nowhere
the
audience
were
much
edified
by
this
passage
of
words
and
mr
podsnap
feeling
that
he
was
in
rather
remarkable
force
became
smiling
and
conversational
anything
more
been
heard
veneering
he
inquired
the
lucky
legatee
more
returned
veneering
that
he
has
come
into
possession
of
the
property
i
am
told
people
now
call
him
the
golden
dustman
i
mentioned
to
you
some
time
ago
i
think
that
the
young
lady
whose
intended
husband
was
murdered
is
daughter
to
a
clerk
of
mine
you
told
me
that
said
podsnap
i
wish
you
would
tell
it
again
here
for
it
a
curious
coincidence
curious
that
the
first
news
of
the
discovery
should
have
been
brought
straight
to
your
table
when
i
was
there
and
curious
that
one
of
your
people
should
have
been
so
nearly
interested
in
it
just
relate
that
will
you
veneering
was
more
than
ready
to
do
it
for
he
had
prospered
exceedingly
upon
the
harmon
murder
and
had
turned
the
social
distinction
it
conferred
upon
him
to
the
account
of
making
several
dozen
of
indeed
such
another
lucky
hit
would
almost
have
set
him
up
in
that
way
to
his
satisfaction
so
addressing
himself
to
the
most
desirable
of
his
neighbours
while
mrs
veneering
secured
the
next
most
desirable
he
plunged
into
the
case
and
emerged
from
it
twenty
minutes
afterwards
with
a
bank
director
in
his
arms
in
the
mean
time
mrs
veneering
had
dived
into
the
same
waters
for
a
wealthy
and
had
brought
him
up
safe
and
sound
by
the
hair
then
mrs
veneering
had
to
relate
to
a
larger
circle
how
she
had
been
to
see
the
girl
and
how
she
was
really
pretty
and
considering
her
station
presentable
and
this
she
did
with
such
a
successful
display
of
her
eight
aquiline
fingers
and
their
encircling
jewels
that
she
happily
laid
hold
of
a
drifting
general
officer
his
wife
and
daughter
and
not
only
restored
their
animation
which
had
become
suspended
but
made
them
lively
friends
within
an
hour
although
mr
podsnap
would
in
a
general
way
have
highly
disapproved
of
bodies
in
rivers
as
ineligible
topics
with
reference
to
the
cheek
of
the
young
person
he
had
as
one
may
say
a
share
in
this
affair
which
made
him
a
part
proprietor
as
its
returns
were
immediate
too
in
the
way
of
restraining
the
company
from
speechless
contemplation
of
the
it
paid
and
he
was
satisfied
and
now
the
haunch
of
mutton
having
received
a
gamey
infusion
and
a
few
last
touches
of
sweets
and
coffee
was
quite
ready
and
the
bathers
came
but
not
before
the
discreet
automaton
had
got
behind
the
bars
of
the
piano
and
there
presented
the
appearance
of
a
captive
languishing
in
a
jail
and
who
now
so
pleasant
or
so
well
assorted
as
mr
and
mrs
alfred
lammle
he
all
sparkle
she
all
gracious
contentment
both
at
occasional
intervals
exchanging
looks
like
partners
at
cards
who
played
a
game
against
all
england
there
was
not
much
youth
among
the
bathers
but
there
was
no
youth
the
young
person
always
excepted
in
the
articles
of
podsnappery
bald
bathers
folded
their
arms
and
talked
to
mr
podsnap
on
the
hearthrug
bathers
with
hats
in
their
hands
lunged
at
mrs
podsnap
and
retreated
prowling
bathers
went
about
looking
into
ornamental
boxes
and
bowls
as
if
they
had
suspicions
of
larceny
on
the
part
of
the
podsnaps
and
expected
to
find
something
they
had
lost
at
the
bottom
bathers
of
the
gentler
sex
sat
silently
comparing
ivory
shoulders
all
this
time
and
always
poor
little
miss
podsnap
whose
tiny
efforts
if
she
had
made
any
were
swallowed
up
in
the
magnificence
of
her
rocking
kept
herself
as
much
out
of
sight
and
mind
as
she
could
and
appeared
to
be
counting
on
many
dismal
returns
of
the
day
it
was
somehow
understood
as
a
secret
article
in
the
state
proprieties
of
podsnappery
that
nothing
must
be
said
about
the
day
consequently
this
young
damsel
nativity
was
hushed
up
and
looked
over
as
if
it
were
agreed
on
all
hands
that
it
would
have
been
better
that
she
had
never
been
born
the
lammles
were
so
fond
of
the
dear
veneerings
that
they
could
not
for
some
time
detach
themselves
from
those
excellent
friends
but
at
length
either
a
very
open
smile
on
mr
lammle
part
or
a
very
secret
elevation
of
one
of
his
gingerous
eyebrows
certainly
the
one
or
the
other
seemed
to
say
to
mrs
lammle
do
you
play
and
so
looking
about
her
she
saw
miss
podsnap
and
seeming
to
say
responsively
card
and
to
be
answered
went
and
sat
beside
miss
podsnap
mrs
lammle
was
overjoyed
to
escape
into
a
corner
for
a
little
quiet
talk
it
promised
to
be
a
very
quiet
talk
for
miss
podsnap
replied
in
a
flutter
indeed
it
very
kind
of
you
but
i
am
afraid
i
talk
us
make
a
beginning
said
the
insinuating
mrs
lammle
with
her
best
smile
i
am
afraid
you
find
me
very
dull
but
ma
talks
that
was
plainly
to
be
seen
for
ma
was
talking
then
at
her
usual
canter
with
arched
head
and
mane
opened
eyes
and
nostrils
of
reading
perhaps
at
least
i
do
mind
that
so
much
returned
miss
podsnap
so
insinuating
was
mrs
lammle
that
she
got
half
a
dozen
ms
into
the
word
before
she
got
it
out
have
nerve
to
play
even
if
i
could
ma
plays
at
exactly
the
same
canter
and
with
a
certain
flourishing
appearance
of
doing
something
ma
did
in
fact
occasionally
take
a
rock
upon
the
instrument
course
you
like
dancing
no
i
do
said
miss
podsnap
with
your
youth
and
attractions
truly
my
dear
you
surprise
me
ca
say
observed
miss
podsnap
after
hesitating
considerably
and
stealing
several
timid
looks
at
mrs
lammle
carefully
arranged
face
i
might
have
liked
it
if
i
had
been
a
you
wo
mention
it
will
you
dear
never
i
am
sure
you
wo
i
ca
say
then
how
i
should
have
liked
it
if
i
had
been
a
on
was
the
exclamation
which
amazement
elicited
from
mrs
lammle
i
knew
you
wonder
but
you
wo
mention
it
will
you
my
word
my
love
said
mrs
lammle
make
me
ten
times
more
desirous
now
i
talk
to
you
to
know
you
well
than
i
was
when
i
sat
over
yonder
looking
at
you
how
i
wish
we
could
be
real
friends
try
me
as
a
real
friend
come
do
fancy
me
a
frumpy
old
married
woman
my
dear
i
was
married
but
the
other
day
you
know
i
am
dressed
as
a
bride
now
you
see
about
the
ma
hear
ca
hear
from
where
she
sits
you
be
too
sure
of
that
said
miss
podsnap
in
a
lower
voice
what
i
mean
is
that
they
seem
to
enjoy
it
that
perhaps
you
would
have
enjoyed
it
if
you
had
been
one
of
them
miss
podsnap
nodded
significantly
you
do
enjoy
it
now
is
it
possible
said
miss
podsnap
it
is
such
a
dreadful
thing
if
i
was
wicked
enough
and
strong
enough
to
kill
anybody
it
should
be
my
partner
this
was
such
an
entirely
new
view
of
the
terpsichorean
art
as
socially
practised
that
mrs
lammle
looked
at
her
young
friend
in
some
astonishment
her
young
friend
sat
nervously
twiddling
her
fingers
in
a
pinioned
attitude
as
if
she
were
trying
to
hide
her
elbows
but
this
latter
utopian
object
in
short
sleeves
always
appeared
to
be
the
great
inoffensive
aim
of
her
existence
sounds
horrid
do
it
said
miss
podsnap
with
a
penitential
face
mrs
lammle
not
very
well
knowing
what
to
answer
resolved
herself
into
a
look
of
smiling
encouragement
it
is
and
it
always
has
been
pursued
miss
podsnap
a
trial
to
me
i
so
dread
being
awful
and
it
is
so
awful
no
one
knows
what
i
suffered
at
madame
sauteuse
where
i
learnt
to
dance
and
make
and
other
dreadful
things
or
at
least
where
they
tried
to
teach
me
ma
can
do
it
any
rate
my
love
said
mrs
lammle
soothingly
over
it
over
returned
miss
podsnap
there
nothing
gained
by
that
it
worse
here
than
at
madame
sauteuse
ma
was
there
and
here
but
pa
was
there
and
company
was
there
and
there
were
not
real
partners
there
oh
there
ma
speaking
to
the
man
at
the
piano
oh
there
ma
going
up
to
somebody
oh
i
know
she
going
to
bring
him
to
me
oh
please
do
please
do
please
do
oh
keep
away
keep
away
keep
away
these
pious
ejaculations
miss
podsnap
uttered
with
her
eyes
closed
and
her
head
leaning
back
against
the
wall
but
the
ogre
advanced
under
the
pilotage
of
ma
and
ma
said
mr
grompus
and
the
ogre
clutched
his
victim
and
bore
her
off
to
his
castle
in
the
top
couple
then
the
discreet
automaton
who
had
surveyed
his
ground
played
a
blossomless
tuneless
and
sixteen
disciples
of
podsnappery
went
through
the
figures
of
getting
up
at
eight
and
shaving
close
at
a
quarter
past
breakfasting
at
nine
going
to
the
city
at
ten
coming
home
at
five
dining
at
seven
and
the
grand
chain
while
these
solemnities
were
in
progress
mr
alfred
lammle
most
loving
of
husbands
approached
the
chair
of
mrs
alfred
lammle
most
loving
of
wives
and
bending
over
the
back
of
it
trifled
for
some
few
seconds
with
mrs
lammle
bracelet
slightly
in
contrast
with
this
brief
airy
toying
one
might
have
noticed
a
certain
dark
attention
in
mrs
face
as
she
said
some
words
with
her
eyes
on
mr
lammle
waistcoat
and
seemed
in
return
to
receive
some
lesson
but
it
was
all
done
as
a
breath
passes
from
a
mirror
and
now
the
grand
chain
riveted
to
the
last
link
the
discreet
automaton
ceased
and
the
sixteen
two
and
two
took
a
walk
among
the
furniture
and
herein
the
unconsciousness
of
the
ogre
grompus
was
pleasantly
conspicuous
for
that
complacent
monster
believing
that
he
was
giving
miss
podsnap
a
treat
prolonged
to
the
utmost
stretch
of
possibility
a
peripatetic
account
of
an
archery
meeting
while
his
victim
heading
the
procession
of
sixteen
as
it
slowly
circled
about
like
a
revolving
funeral
never
raised
her
eyes
except
once
to
steal
a
glance
at
mrs
lammle
expressive
of
intense
despair
at
length
the
procession
was
dissolved
by
the
violent
arrival
of
a
nutmeg
before
which
the
door
bounced
open
as
if
it
were
a
and
while
that
fragrant
article
dispersed
through
several
glasses
of
coloured
warm
water
was
going
the
round
of
society
miss
podsnap
returned
to
her
seat
by
her
new
friend
my
goodness
said
miss
podsnap
over
i
hope
you
look
at
me
dear
why
not
i
know
all
about
myself
said
miss
podsnap
tell
you
something
i
know
about
you
my
dear
returned
mrs
lammle
in
her
winning
way
that
is
you
are
most
unnecessarily
shy
ai
said
miss
podsnap
i
detest
you
go
along
this
shot
was
levelled
under
her
breath
at
the
gallant
grompus
for
bestowing
an
insinuating
smile
upon
her
in
passing
me
if
i
scarcely
see
my
dear
miss
podsnap
mrs
lammle
was
beginning
when
the
young
lady
interposed
we
are
going
to
be
real
friends
and
i
suppose
we
are
for
you
are
the
only
person
who
ever
proposed
it
do
let
us
be
awful
it
awful
enough
to
be
miss
podsnap
without
being
called
so
call
me
georgiana
georgiana
mrs
lammle
began
again
you
said
miss
podsnap
georgiana
pardon
me
if
i
scarcely
see
my
love
why
your
mamma
not
being
shy
is
a
reason
why
you
should
be
you
really
see
that
asked
miss
podsnap
plucking
at
her
fingers
in
a
troubled
manner
and
furtively
casting
her
eyes
now
on
mrs
lammle
now
on
the
ground
perhaps
it
is
dearest
georgiana
you
defer
much
too
readily
to
my
poor
opinion
indeed
it
is
not
even
an
opinion
darling
for
it
is
only
a
confession
of
my
dullness
you
are
not
dull
returned
miss
podsnap
am
dull
but
you
could
have
made
me
talk
if
you
were
some
little
touch
of
conscience
answering
this
perception
of
her
having
gained
a
purpose
called
bloom
enough
into
mrs
lammle
face
to
make
it
look
brighter
as
she
sat
smiling
her
best
smile
on
her
dear
georgiana
and
shaking
her
head
with
an
affectionate
playfulness
not
that
it
meant
anything
but
that
georgiana
seemed
to
like
it
i
mean
is
pursued
georgiana
ma
being
so
endowed
with
awfulness
and
pa
being
so
endowed
with
awfulness
and
there
being
so
much
awfulness
everywhere
i
mean
at
least
everywhere
where
i
am
perhaps
it
makes
me
who
am
so
deficient
in
awfulness
and
frightened
at
it
i
say
it
very
badly
i
do
know
whether
you
can
understand
what
i
mean
dearest
georgiana
mrs
lammle
was
proceeding
with
every
reassuring
wile
when
the
head
of
that
young
lady
suddenly
went
back
against
the
wall
again
and
her
eyes
closed
there
ma
being
awful
with
somebody
with
a
glass
in
his
eye
oh
i
know
she
going
to
bring
him
here
oh
do
bring
him
do
bring
him
oh
he
be
my
partner
with
his
glass
in
his
eye
oh
what
shall
i
do
this
time
georgiana
accompanied
her
ejaculations
with
taps
of
her
feet
upon
the
floor
and
was
altogether
in
quite
a
desperate
condition
but
there
was
no
escape
from
the
majestic
mrs
podsnap
production
of
an
ambling
stranger
with
one
eye
screwed
up
into
extinction
and
the
other
framed
and
glazed
who
having
looked
down
out
of
that
organ
as
if
he
descried
miss
podsnap
at
the
bottom
of
some
perpendicular
shaft
brought
her
to
the
surface
and
ambled
off
with
her
and
then
the
captive
at
the
piano
played
another
expressive
of
his
mournful
aspirations
after
freedom
and
other
sixteen
went
through
the
former
melancholy
motions
and
the
ambler
took
miss
podsnap
for
a
furniture
walk
as
if
he
had
struck
out
an
entirely
original
conception
in
the
mean
time
a
stray
personage
of
a
meek
demeanour
who
had
wandered
to
the
hearthrug
and
got
among
the
heads
of
tribes
assembled
there
in
conference
with
mr
podsnap
eliminated
mr
podsnap
flush
and
flourish
by
a
highly
unpolite
remark
no
less
than
a
reference
to
the
circumstance
that
some
people
had
lately
died
in
the
streets
of
starvation
it
was
clearly
after
dinner
it
was
not
adapted
to
the
cheek
of
the
young
person
it
was
not
in
good
taste
do
believe
it
said
mr
podsnap
putting
it
behind
him
the
meek
man
was
afraid
we
must
take
it
as
proved
because
there
were
the
inquests
and
the
registrar
returns
it
was
their
own
fault
said
mr
podsnap
veneering
and
other
elders
of
tribes
commended
this
way
out
of
it
at
once
a
short
cut
and
a
broad
road
the
man
of
meek
demeanour
intimated
that
truly
it
would
seem
from
the
facts
as
if
starvation
had
been
forced
upon
the
culprits
in
question
as
if
in
their
wretched
manner
they
had
made
their
weak
protests
against
it
as
if
they
would
have
taken
the
liberty
of
staving
it
off
if
they
could
as
if
they
would
rather
not
have
been
starved
upon
the
whole
if
perfectly
agreeable
to
all
parties
is
not
said
mr
podsnap
flushing
angrily
is
not
a
country
in
the
world
sir
where
so
noble
a
provision
is
made
for
the
poor
as
in
this
country
the
meek
man
was
quite
willing
to
concede
that
but
perhaps
it
rendered
the
matter
even
worse
as
showing
that
there
must
be
something
appallingly
wrong
somewhere
said
mr
podsnap
the
meek
man
hinted
would
it
be
well
to
try
very
seriously
to
find
out
where
said
mr
podsnap
to
say
somewhere
not
so
easy
to
say
where
but
i
see
what
you
are
driving
at
i
knew
it
from
the
first
centralization
no
never
with
my
consent
not
english
an
approving
murmur
arose
from
the
heads
of
tribes
as
saying
you
have
him
hold
him
he
was
not
aware
the
meek
man
submitted
of
himself
that
he
was
driving
at
any
ization
he
had
no
favourite
ization
that
he
knew
of
but
he
certainly
was
more
staggered
by
these
terrible
occurrences
than
he
was
by
names
of
howsoever
so
many
syllables
might
he
ask
was
dying
of
destitution
and
neglect
necessarily
english
know
what
the
population
of
london
is
i
suppose
said
mr
podsnap
the
meek
man
supposed
he
did
but
supposed
that
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
it
if
its
laws
were
well
administered
you
know
at
least
i
hope
you
know
said
mr
podsnap
with
severity
providence
has
declared
that
you
shall
have
the
poor
always
with
you
the
meek
man
also
hoped
he
knew
that
am
glad
to
hear
it
said
mr
podsnap
with
a
portentous
air
am
glad
to
hear
it
it
will
render
you
cautious
how
you
fly
in
the
face
of
providence
in
reference
to
that
absurd
and
irreverent
conventional
phrase
the
meek
man
said
for
which
mr
podsnap
was
not
responsible
he
the
meek
man
had
no
fear
of
doing
anything
so
impossible
but
but
mr
podsnap
felt
that
the
time
had
come
for
flushing
and
flourishing
this
meek
man
down
for
good
so
he
said
must
decline
to
pursue
this
painful
discussion
it
is
not
pleasant
to
my
feelings
it
is
repugnant
to
my
feelings
i
have
said
that
i
do
not
admit
these
things
i
have
also
said
that
if
they
do
occur
not
that
i
admit
it
the
fault
lies
with
the
sufferers
themselves
it
is
not
for
me
mr
podsnap
pointed
forcibly
as
adding
by
implication
though
it
may
be
all
very
well
for
you
is
not
for
me
to
impugn
the
workings
of
providence
i
know
better
than
that
i
trust
and
i
have
mentioned
what
the
intentions
of
providence
are
besides
said
mr
podsnap
flushing
high
up
among
his
with
a
strong
consciousness
of
personal
affront
subject
is
a
very
disagreeable
one
i
will
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
is
an
odious
one
it
is
not
one
to
be
introduced
among
our
wives
and
young
persons
and
i
he
finished
with
that
flourish
of
his
arm
which
added
more
expressively
than
any
words
and
i
remove
it
from
the
face
of
the
earth

mr

was
proud
to
be
so
soon
distinguished
by
this
special
commendation
to
miss

but
if
mr

were
prone
to

he
would
be

her

while
she
answered
in
a
secret

tone
forget

when
you
are
gone
away
and
come
again
soon
good
night
charming
to
see
mr
and
mrs
lammle
taking
leave
so
gracefully
and
going
down
the
stairs
so
lovingly
and
sweetly
not
quite
so
charming
to
see
their
smiling
faces
fall
and
brood
as
they
dropped
moodily
into
separate
corners
of
their
little
carriage
but
to
be
sure
that
was
a
sight
behind
the
scenes
which
nobody
saw
and
which
nobody
was
meant
to
see
certain
big
heavy
vehicles
built
on
the
model
of
the
podsnap
plate
took
away
the
heavy
articles
of
guests
weighing
ever
so
much
and
the
less
valuable
articles
got
away
after
their
various
manners
and
the
podsnap
plate
was
put
to
bed
as
mr
podsnap
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
pulling
up
his
shirtcollar
like
a
veritable
cock
of
the
walk
literally
pluming
himself
in
the
midst
of
his
possessions
nothing
would
have
astonished
him
more
than
an
intimation
that
miss
podsnap
or
any
other
young
person
properly
born
and
bred
could
not
be
exactly
put
away
like
the
plate
brought
out
like
the
plate
polished
like
the
plate
counted
weighed
and
valued
like
the
plate
that
such
a
young
person
could
possibly
have
a
morbid
vacancy
in
the
heart
for
anything
younger
than
the
plate
or
less
monotonous
than
the
plate
or
that
such
a
young
person
thoughts
could
try
to
scale
the
region
bounded
on
the
north
south
east
and
west
by
the
plate
was
a
monstrous
imagination
which
he
would
on
the
spot
have
flourished
into
space
this
perhaps
in
some
sort
arose
from
mr
podsnap
blushing
young
person
being
so
to
speak
all
cheek
whereas
there
is
a
possibility
that
there
may
be
young
persons
of
a
rather
more
complex
organization
if
mr
podsnap
pulling
up
his
could
only
have
heard
himself
called
fellow
in
a
certain
short
dialogue
which
passed
between
mr
and
mrs
lammle
in
their
opposite
corners
of
their
little
carriage
rolling
home
are
you
awake
i
likely
to
be
asleep
sir
likely
i
should
think
after
that
fellow
company
attend
to
what
i
am
going
to
say
have
attended
to
what
you
have
already
said
have
i
not
what
else
have
i
been
doing
all
i
tell
you
in
a
raised
voice
what
i
am
going
to
say
keep
close
to
that
idiot
girl
keep
her
under
your
thumb
you
have
her
fast
and
you
are
not
to
let
her
go
do
you
hear
hear
you
foresee
there
is
money
to
be
made
out
of
this
besides
taking
that
fellow
down
a
peg
we
owe
each
other
money
you
know
mrs
lammle
winced
a
little
at
the
reminder
but
only
enough
to
shake
her
scents
and
essences
anew
into
the
atmosphere
of
the
little
carriage
as
she
settled
herself
afresh

man
brow
mr
mortimer
lightwood
and
mr
eugene
wrayburn
took
a
dinner
together
in
mr
lightwood
office
they
had
newly
agreed
to
set
up
a
joint
establishment
together
they
had
taken
a
bachelor
cottage
near
hampton
on
the
brink
of
the
thames
with
a
lawn
and
a
and
all
things
fitting
and
were
to
float
with
the
stream
through
the
summer
and
the
long
vacation
it
was
not
summer
yet
but
spring
and
it
was
not
gentle
spring
ethereally
mild
as
in
thomson
seasons
but
nipping
spring
with
an
easterly
wind
as
in
johnson
jackson
dickson
smith
and
jones
seasons
the
grating
wind
sawed
rather
than
blew
and
as
it
sawed
the
sawdust
whirled
about
the
sawpit
every
street
was
a
sawpit
and
there
were
no
every
passenger
was
an
with
the
sawdust
blinding
him
and
choking
him
that
mysterious
paper
currency
which
circulates
in
london
when
the
wind
blows
gyrated
here
and
there
and
everywhere
whence
can
it
come
whither
can
it
go
it
hangs
on
every
bush
flutters
in
every
tree
is
caught
flying
by
the
electric
wires
haunts
every
enclosure
drinks
at
every
pump
cowers
at
every
grating
shudders
upon
every
plot
of
grass
seeks
rest
in
vain
behind
the
legions
of
iron
rails
in
paris
where
nothing
is
wasted
costly
and
luxurious
city
though
it
be
but
where
wonderful
human
ants
creep
out
of
holes
and
pick
up
every
scrap
there
is
no
such
thing
there
it
blows
nothing
but
dust
there
sharp
eyes
and
sharp
stomachs
reap
even
the
east
wind
and
get
something
out
of
it
the
wind
sawed
and
the
sawdust
whirled
the
shrubs
wrung
their
many
hands
bemoaning
that
they
had
been
by
the
sun
to
bud
the
young
leaves
pined
the
sparrows
repented
of
their
early
marriages
like
men
and
women
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
were
discernible
not
in
floral
spring
but
in
the
faces
of
the
people
whom
it
nibbled
and
pinched
and
ever
the
wind
sawed
and
the
sawdust
whirled
when
the
spring
evenings
are
too
long
and
light
to
shut
out
and
such
weather
is
rife
the
city
which
mr
podsnap
so
explanatorily
called
london
londres
london
is
at
its
worst
such
a
black
shrill
city
combining
the
qualities
of
a
smoky
house
and
a
scolding
wife
such
a
gritty
city
such
a
hopeless
city
with
no
rent
in
the
leaden
canopy
of
its
sky
such
a
beleaguered
city
invested
by
the
great
marsh
forces
of
essex
and
kent
so
the
two
old
schoolfellows
felt
it
to
be
as
their
dinner
done
they
turned
towards
the
fire
to
smoke
young
blight
was
gone
the
waiter
was
gone
the
plates
and
dishes
were
gone
the
wine
was
going
but
not
in
the
same
direction
wind
sounds
up
here
quoth
eugene
stirring
the
fire
if
we
were
keeping
a
lighthouse
i
wish
we
were
you
think
it
would
bore
us
lightwood
asked
more
than
any
other
place
and
there
would
be
no
circuit
to
go
but
that
a
selfish
consideration
personal
to
me
no
clients
to
come
added
lightwood
that
that
a
selfish
consideration
at
all
personal
to
me
we
were
on
an
isolated
rock
in
a
stormy
sea
said
eugene
smoking
with
his
eyes
on
the
fire
tippins
could
put
off
to
visit
us
or
better
still
might
put
off
and
get
swamped
people
could
ask
one
to
wedding
breakfasts
there
would
be
no
precedents
to
hammer
at
except
the
precedent
of
keeping
the
light
up
it
would
be
exciting
to
look
out
for
wrecks
otherwise
suggested
lightwood
might
be
a
degree
of
sameness
in
the
life
have
thought
of
that
also
said
eugene
as
if
he
really
had
been
considering
the
subject
in
its
various
bearings
with
an
eye
to
the
business
it
would
be
a
defined
and
limited
monotony
it
would
not
extend
beyond
two
people
now
it
a
question
with
me
mortimer
whether
a
monotony
defined
with
that
precision
and
limited
to
that
extent
might
not
be
more
endurable
than
the
unlimited
monotony
of
as
lightwood
laughed
and
passed
the
wine
he
remarked
shall
have
an
opportunity
in
our
boating
summer
of
trying
the
question
imperfect
one
eugene
acquiesced
with
a
sigh
so
we
shall
i
hope
we
may
not
prove
too
much
for
one
another
regarding
your
respected
father
said
lightwood
bringing
him
to
a
subject
they
had
expressly
appointed
to
discuss
always
the
most
slippery
eel
of
eels
of
subjects
to
lay
hold
of
regarding
my
respected
father
assented
eugene
settling
himself
in
his
would
rather
have
approached
my
respected
father
by
candlelight
as
a
theme
requiring
a
little
artificial
brilliancy
but
we
will
take
him
by
twilight
enlivened
with
a
glow
of
wallsend
he
stirred
the
fire
again
as
he
spoke
and
having
made
it
blaze
resumed
respected
father
has
found
down
in
the
parental
neighbourhood
a
wife
for
his
son
some
money
of
course
some
money
of
course
or
he
would
not
have
found
her
my
respected
father
let
me
shorten
the
dutiful
tautology
by
substituting
in
future
which
sounds
military
and
rather
like
the
duke
of
wellington
an
absurd
fellow
you
are
eugene
at
all
i
assure
you
having
always
in
the
clearest
manner
provided
as
he
calls
it
for
his
children
by
from
the
hour
of
the
birth
of
each
and
sometimes
from
an
earlier
period
what
the
devoted
little
victim
calling
and
course
in
life
should
be
for
myself
that
i
was
to
be
the
barrister
i
am
with
the
slight
addition
of
an
enormous
practice
which
has
not
accrued
and
also
the
married
man
i
am
not
first
you
have
often
told
me
first
i
have
often
told
you
considering
myself
sufficiently
incongruous
on
my
legal
eminence
i
have
until
now
suppressed
my
domestic
destiny
you
know
but
not
as
well
as
i
do
if
you
knew
him
as
well
as
i
do
he
would
amuse
you
spoken
eugene
so
believe
me
and
with
every
sentiment
of
affectionate
deference
towards
but
if
he
amuses
me
i
ca
help
it
when
my
eldest
brother
was
born
of
course
the
rest
of
us
knew
i
mean
the
rest
of
us
would
have
known
if
we
had
been
in
existence
that
he
was
heir
to
the
family
embarrassments
we
call
it
before
the
company
the
family
estate
but
when
my
second
brother
was
going
to
be
born
this
says
is
a
little
pillar
of
the
was
born
and
became
a
pillar
of
the
church
a
very
shaky
one
my
third
brother
appeared
considerably
in
advance
of
his
engagement
to
my
mother
but
not
at
all
put
out
by
surprise
instantly
declared
him
a
circumnavigator
was
into
the
navy
but
has
not
circumnavigated
i
announced
myself
and
was
disposed
of
with
the
highly
satisfactory
results
embodied
before
you
when
my
younger
brother
was
half
an
hour
old
it
was
settled
by
that
he
should
have
a
mechanical
genius
and
so
on
therefore
i
say
that
amuses
me
the
lady
eugene
ceases
to
be
amusing
because
my
intentions
are
opposed
to
touching
the
lady
you
know
her
in
the
least
you
better
see
her
dear
mortimer
you
have
studied
my
character
could
i
possibly
go
down
there
labelled
eligible
on
view
and
meet
the
lady
similarly
labelled
anything
to
carry
out
arrangements
i
am
sure
with
the
greatest
pleasure
except
matrimony
could
i
possibly
support
it
i
so
soon
bored
so
constantly
so
fatally
you
are
not
a
consistent
fellow
eugene
susceptibility
to
boredom
returned
that
worthy
assure
you
i
am
the
most
consistent
of
mankind
it
was
but
now
that
you
were
dwelling
in
the
advantages
of
a
monotony
of
two
a
lighthouse
do
me
the
justice
to
remember
the
condition
in
a
lighthouse
mortimer
laughed
again
and
eugene
having
laughed
too
for
the
first
time
as
if
he
found
himself
on
reflection
rather
entertaining
relapsed
into
his
usual
gloom
and
drowsily
said
as
he
enjoyed
his
cigar
there
is
no
help
for
it
one
of
the
prophetic
deliveries
of
must
for
ever
remain
unfulfilled
with
every
disposition
to
oblige
him
he
must
submit
to
a
failure
it
had
grown
darker
as
they
talked
and
the
wind
was
sawing
and
the
sawdust
was
whirling
outside
paler
windows
the
underlying
churchyard
was
already
settling
into
deep
dim
shade
and
the
shade
was
creeping
up
to
the
housetops
among
which
they
sat
if
said
eugene
if
the
churchyard
ghosts
were
rising
he
had
walked
to
the
window
with
his
cigar
in
his
mouth
to
exalt
its
flavour
by
comparing
the
fireside
with
the
outside
when
he
stopped
midway
on
his
return
to
his
and
said
one
of
the
ghosts
has
lost
its
way
and
dropped
in
to
be
directed
look
at
this
phantom
lightwood
whose
back
was
towards
the
door
turned
his
head
and
there
in
the
darkness
of
the
entry
stood
a
something
in
the
likeness
of
a
man
to
whom
he
addressed
the
not
irrelevant
inquiry
the
devil
are
you
ask
your
pardons
governors
replied
the
ghost
in
a
hoarse
whisper
might
either
on
you
be
lawyer
lightwood
do
you
mean
by
not
knocking
at
the
door
demanded
mortimer
ask
your
pardons
governors
replied
the
ghost
as
before
probable
you
was
not
aware
your
door
stood
open
do
you
want
hereunto
the
ghost
again
hoarsely
replied
in
its
manner
ask
your
pardons
governors
but
might
one
on
you
be
lawyer
lightwood
of
us
is
said
the
owner
of
that
name
right
governors
both
returned
the
ghost
carefully
closing
the
room
door
business
mortimer
lighted
the
candles
they
showed
the
visitor
to
be
an
visitor
with
a
squinting
leer
who
as
he
spoke
fumbled
at
an
old
sodden
fur
cap
formless
and
mangey
that
looked
like
a
furry

the
visitor
clearly
anything
but
reliant
on
this
assurance
doggedly
muttered
david
that

the

david
which
eugene
smoking

lightwood
with
his
indolent
laugh
i

eugene
explained
so
can
i
but
we
ca
do
more
for
you
much
discomfited
by
this
information
the
visitor
turned
the
drowned
dog
or
cat
puppy
or
kitten
about
and
about
and
looked
from
one
of
the
governors
both
to
the
other
of
the
governors
both
while
he
deeply
considered
within
himself
at
length
he
decided
i
must
be
took
down
asked
lightwood
said
the
man
pen
and
ink
let
us
know
what
your
business
is
about
about
said
the
man
taking
a
step
forward
dropping
his
hoarse
voice
and
shading
it
with
his
hand
about
from
five
to
ten
thousand
pound
reward
that
what
it
about
it
about
murder
what
it
about
nearer
the
table
sit
down
will
you
have
a
glass
of
wine
i
will
said
the
man
i
do
deceive
you
governors
it
was
given
him
making
a
stiff
arm
to
the
elbow
he
poured
the
wine
into
his
mouth
tilted
it
into
his
right
cheek
as
saying
do
you
think
of
it
tilted
it
into
his
left
cheek
as
saying
do
you
think
of
it
jerked
it
into
his
stomach
as
saying
do
you
think
of
it
to
conclude
smacked
his
lips
as
if
all
three
replied
think
well
of
it
you
have
another
i
will
he
repeated
i
do
deceive
you
governors
and
also
repeated
the
other
proceedings
began
lightwood
your
name
there
you
rather
fast
lawyer
lightwood
he
replied
in
a
remonstrant
manner
you
see
lawyer
lightwood
there
you
a
little
bit
fast
i
going
to
earn
from
five
to
ten
thousand
pound
by
the
sweat
of
my
brow
and
as
a
poor
man
doing
justice
to
the
sweat
of
my
brow
is
it
likely
i
can
afford
to
part
with
so
much
as
my
name
without
its
being
took
down
deferring
to
the
man
sense
of
the
binding
powers
of
pen
and
ink
and
paper
lightwood
nodded
acceptance
of
eugene
nodded
proposal
to
take
those
spells
in
hand
eugene
bringing
them
to
the
table
sat
down
as
clerk
or
notary
said
lightwood
your
name
but
further
precaution
was
still
due
to
the
sweat
of
this
honest
fellow
brow
should
wish
lawyer
lightwood
he
stipulated
have
that
governor
as
my
witness
that
what
i
said
i
said
consequent
will
the
governor
be
so
good
as
chuck
me
his
name
and
where
he
lives
eugene
cigar
in
mouth
and
pen
in
hand
tossed
him
his
card
after
spelling
it
out
slowly
the
man
made
it
into
a
little
roll
and
tied
it
up
in
an
end
of
his
neckerchief
still
more
slowly
said
lightwood
for
the
third
time
you
have
quite
completed
your
various
preparations
my
friend
and
have
fully
ascertained
that
your
spirits
are
cool
and
not
in
any
way
hurried
what
your
name
riderhood
hole
or
occupation
not
quite
so
glib
with
this
answer
as
with
the
previous
two
mr
riderhood
gave
in
the
definition
character
against
you
eugene
quietly
put
in
as
he
wrote
rather
baulked
mr
riderhood
evasively
remarked
with
an
innocent
air
that
he
believed
the
governor
had
asked
him
in
trouble
said
eugene
might
happen
to
any
man
mr
riderhood
added
incidentally
suspicion
of
seaman
pocket
said
mr
riderhood
i
was
in
reality
the
man
best
friend
and
tried
to
take
care
of
him
the
sweat
of
your
brow
asked
eugene
it
poured
down
like
rain
said
roger
riderhood
eugene
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
smoked
with
his
eyes
negligently
turned
on
the
informer
and
his
pen
ready
to
reduce
him
to
more
writing
lightwood
also
smoked
with
his
eyes
negligently
turned
on
the
informer
let
me
be
took
down
again
said
riderhood
when
he
had
turned
the
drowned
cap
over
and
under
and
had
brushed
it
the
wrong
way
if
it
had
a
right
way
with
his
sleeve
give
information
that
the
man
that
done
the
harmon
murder
is
gaffer
hexam
the
man
that
found
the
body
the
hand
of
jesse
hexam
commonly
called
gaffer
on
the
river
and
along
shore
is
the
hand
that
done
that
deed
his
hand
and
no
other
the
two
friends
glanced
at
one
another
with
more
serious
faces
than
they
had
shown
yet
us
on
what
grounds
you
make
this
accusation
said
mortimer
lightwood
the
grounds
answered
riderhood
wiping
his
face
with
his
sleeve
i
was
gaffer
pardner
and
suspected
of
him
many
a
long
day
and
many
a
dark
night
on
the
grounds
that
i
knowed
his
ways
on
the
grounds
that
i
broke
the
pardnership
because
i
see
the
danger
which
i
warn
you
his
daughter
may
tell
you
another
story
about
that
for
anythink
i
can
say
but
you
know
what
it
be
worth
for
she
tell
you
lies
the
world
round
and
the
heavens
broad
to
save
her
father
on
the
grounds
that
it
well
understood
along
the
and
the
stairs
that
he
done
it
on
the
grounds
that
he
fell
off
from
because
he
done
it
on
the
grounds
that
i
will
swear
he
done
it
on
the
grounds
that
you
may
take
me
where
you
will
and
get
me
sworn
to
it
i
do
want
to
back
out
of
the
consequences
i
have
made
up
my
mind
take
me
anywheres
this
is
nothing
said
lightwood
repeated
riderhood
indignantly
and
amazedly
nothing
it
goes
to
no
more
than
that
you
suspect
this
man
of
the
crime
you
may
do
so
with
some
reason
or
you
may
do
so
with
no
reason
but
he
can
not
be
convicted
on
your
suspicion
i
said
i
appeal
to
the
governor
as
my
witness
i
said
from
the
first
minute
that
i
opened
my
mouth
in
this
here
chair
he
evidently
used
that
form
of
words
as
next
in
force
to
an
affidavit
i
was
willing
to
swear
that
he
done
it
have
i
said
take
me
and
get
me
sworn
to
it
do
i
say
so
now
you
wo
deny
it
lawyer
lightwood
not
but
you
only
offer
to
swear
to
your
suspicion
and
i
tell
you
it
is
not
enough
to
swear
to
your
suspicion
enough
ai
it
lawyer
lightwood
he
cautiously
demanded
not
did
i
say
it
was
enough
now
i
appeal
to
the
governor
now
fair
did
i
say
so
certainly
has
not
said
that
he
had
no
more
to
tell
eugene
observed
in
a
low
voice
without
looking
at
him
he
seemed
to
imply
cried
the
informer
triumphantly
perceiving
that
the
remark
was
generally
in
his
favour
though
apparently
not
closely
understanding
it
for
me
i
had
a
witness
on
then
said
lightwood
out
what
you
have
to
say
no
me
be
took
down
then
cried
the
informer
eagerly
and
anxiously
me
be
took
down
for
by
george
and
the
draggin
i
a
coming
to
it
now
do
do
nothing
to
keep
back
from
a
honest
man
the
fruits
of
the
sweat
of
his
brow
i
give
information
then
that
he
told
me
that
he
done
it
is
that
enough
care
what
you
say
my
friend
returned
mortimer
lightwood
take
care
you
what
i
say
for
i
judge
you
be
answerable
for
follering
it
up
then
slowly
and
emphatically
beating
it
all
out
with
his
open
right
hand
on
the
palm
of
his
left
roger
riderhood
hole
waterside
character
tell
you
lawyer
lightwood
that
the
man
jesse
hexam
commonly
called
upon
the
river
and
gaffer
told
me
that
he
done
the
deed
what
more
he
told
me
with
his
own
lips
that
he
done
the
deed
what
more
he
said
that
he
done
the
deed
and
i
swear
it
did
he
tell
you
so
replied
riderhood
always
beating
it
out
with
his
head
determinedly
set
askew
and
his
eyes
watchfully
dividing
their
attention
between
his
two
auditors
the
door
of
the
six
jolly
fellowships
towards
a
quarter
after
twelve
at
midnight
but
i
will
not
in
my
conscience
undertake
to
swear
to
so
fine
a
matter
as
five
minutes
on
the
night
when
he
picked
up
the
body
the
six
jolly
fellowships
wo
run
away
if
it
turns
out
that
he
war
at
the
six
jolly
fellowships
that
night
at
midnight
i
a
liar
did
he
say
tell
you
take
me
down
governor
i
ask
no
better
he
come
out
first
i
come
out
last
i
might
be
a
minute
arter
him
i
might
be
half
a
minute
i
might
be
a
quarter
of
a
minute
i
can
not
swear
to
that
and
therefore
i
wo
that
knowing
the
obligations
of
a
alfred
david
ai
it
on
found
him
a
waiting
to
speak
to
me
he
says
to
me
rogue
riderhood
for
that
the
name
i
mostly
called
by
not
for
any
meaning
in
it
for
meaning
it
has
none
but
because
of
its
being
similar
to
roger
mind
that
me
lawyer
lightwood
it
a
part
of
the
truth
and
as
such
i
do
mind
it
and
i
must
mind
it
and
i
will
mind
it
rogue
riderhood
he
says
words
passed
betwixt
us
on
the
river
which
they
had
ask
his
daughter
i
threatened
you
he
says
to
chop
you
over
the
fingers
with
my
boat
stretcher
or
take
a
aim
at
your
brains
with
my
boathook
i
did
so
on
accounts
of
your
looking
too
hard
at
what
i
had
in
tow
as
if
you
was
suspicious
and
on
accounts
of
your
holding
on
to
the
gunwale
of
my
i
says
to
him
gaffer
i
know
he
says
to
me
rogue
riderhood
you
are
a
man
in
a
dozen
i
think
he
said
in
a
score
but
of
that
i
am
not
positive
so
take
the
lowest
figure
for
precious
be
the
obligations
of
a
alfred
david
and
he
says
when
your
is
up
be
it
their
lives
or
be
it
their
watches
sharp
is
ever
the
word
with
you
had
you
suspicions
i
says
gaffer
i
had
and
what
more
i
he
falls
a
shaking
and
he
says
of
what
i
says
of
foul
he
falls
a
shaking
worse
and
he
says
there
was
foul
play
then
i
done
it
for
his
money
do
betray
me
those
were
the
words
as
ever
he
used
there
was
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
fall
of
the
ashes
in
the
grate
an
opportunity
which
the
informer
improved
by
smearing
himself
all
over
the
head
and
neck
and
face
with
his
drowned
cap
and
not
at
all
improving
his
own
appearance
more
asked
lightwood
him
d
mean
lawyer
lightwood
anything
to
the
purpose
i
blest
if
i
understand
you
governors
both
said
the
informer
in
a
creeping
manner
propitiating
both
though
only
one
had
spoken
ai
that
enough
you
ask
him
how
he
did
it
where
he
did
it
when
he
did
it
be
it
from
me
lawyer
lightwood
i
was
so
troubled
in
my
mind
that
i
would
have
knowed
more
no
not
for
the
sum
as
i
expect
to
earn
from
you
by
the
sweat
of
my
brow
twice
told
i
had
put
an
end
to
the
pardnership
i
had
cut
the
connexion
i
could
undo
what
was
done
and
when
he
begs
and
prays
old
pardner
on
my
knees
do
split
upon
me
i
only
makes
answer
never
speak
another
word
to
roger
riderhood
nor
look
him
in
the
face
and
i
shuns
that
man
having
given
these
words
a
swing
to
make
them
mount
the
higher
and
go
the
further
rogue
riderhood
poured
himself
out
another
glass
of
wine
unbidden
and
seemed
to
chew
it
as
with
the
glass
in
his
hand
he
stared
at
the
candles
mortimer
glanced
at
eugene
but
eugene
sat
glowering
at
his
paper
and
would
give
him
no
responsive
glance
mortimer
again
turned
to
the
informer
to
whom
he
said
have
been
troubled
in
your
mind
a
long
time
man
giving
his
wine
a
final
chew
and
swallowing
it
the
informer
answered
in
a
single
word
all
that
stir
was
made
when
the
government
reward
was
offered
when
the
police
were
on
the
alert
when
the
whole
country
rang
with
the
crime
said
mortimer
impatiently
mr
riderhood
very
slowly
and
hoarsely
chimed
in
with
several
retrospective
nods
of
his
head
i
troubled
in
my
mind
then
conjecture
ran
wild
when
the
most
extravagant
suspicions
were
afloat
when
half
a
dozen
innocent
people
might
have
been
laid
by
the
heels
any
hour
in
the
day
said
mortimer
almost
warming
mr
riderhood
chimed
in
as
before
i
troubled
in
my
mind
through
it
all
he
had
said
eugene
drawing
a
lady
head
upon
his
and
touching
it
at
intervals
opportunity
then
of
earning
so
much
money
you
see
governor
hits
the
nail
lawyer
lightwood
it
was
that
as
turned
me
i
had
many
times
and
again
struggled
to
relieve
myself
of
the
trouble
on
my
mind
but
i
could
get
it
off
i
had
once
very
nigh
got
it
off
to
miss
abbey
potterson
which
keeps
the
six
jolly
fellowships
there
is
the
it
wo
run
away
there
lives
the
lady
she
ai
likely
to
be
struck
dead
afore
you
get
there
ask
her
but
i
could
do
it
at
last
out
comes
the
new
bill
with
your
own
lawful
name
lawyer
lightwood
printed
to
it
and
then
i
asks
the
question
of
my
own
intellects
am
i
to
have
this
trouble
on
my
mind
for
ever
am
i
never
to
throw
it
off
am
i
always
to
think
more
of
gaffer
than
of
my
own
self
if
he
got
a
daughter
ai
i
got
a
daughter
echo
answered
eugene
suggested
you
have
said
mr
riderhood
in
a
firm
tone
mentioning
at
the
same
time
her
age
inquired
eugene
governor
last
october
and
then
i
put
it
to
myself
regarding
the
money
it
is
a
pot
of
for
it
is
a
pot
said
mr
riderhood
with
candour
why
deny
it
from
eugene
as
he
touched
his
drawing
it
is
a
pot
of
money
but
is
it
a
sin
for
a
labouring
man
that
moistens
every
crust
of
bread
he
earns
with
his
tears
or
if
not
with
them
with
the
colds
he
catches
in
his
head
is
it
a
sin
for
that
man
to
earn
it
say
there
is
anything
again
earning
this
i
put
to
myself
strong
as
in
duty
bound
how
can
it
be
said
without
blaming
lawyer
lightwood
for
offering
it
to
be
earned
and
was
it
for
me
to
blame
lawyer
lightwood
no
said
eugene
not
governor
mr
riderhood
acquiesced
i
made
up
my
mind
to
get
my
trouble
off
my
mind
and
to
earn
by
the
sweat
of
my
brow
what
was
held
out
to
me
and
what
more
he
added
suddenly
turning
bloodthirsty
mean
to
have
it
and
now
i
tell
you
once
and
away
lawyer
lightwood
that
jesse
hexam
commonly
called
gaffer
his
hand
and
no
other
done
the
deed
on
his
own
confession
to
me
and
i
give
him
up
to
you
and
i
want
him
took
this
night
after
another
silence
broken
only
by
the
fall
of
the
ashes
in
the
grate
which
attracted
the
informer
attention
as
if
it
were
the
chinking
of
money
mortimer
lightwood
leaned
over
his
friend
and
said
in
a
whisper
suppose
i
must
go
with
this
fellow
to
our
imperturbable
friend
at
the
suppose
said
eugene
is
no
help
for
it
you
believe
him
believe
him
to
be
a
thorough
rascal
but
he
may
tell
the
truth
for
his
own
purpose
and
for
this
occasion
only
does
look
like
it
does
said
eugene
neither
is
his
late
partner
whom
he
denounces
a
prepossessing
person
the
firm
are
shepherds
both
in
appearance
i
should
like
to
ask
him
one
thing
the
subject
of
this
conference
sat
leering
at
the
ashes
trying
with
all
his
might
to
overhear
what
was
said
but
feigning
abstraction
as
the
both
glanced
at
him
mentioned
twice
i
think
a
daughter
of
this
hexam
said
eugene
aloud
do
mean
to
imply
that
she
had
any
guilty
knowledge
of
the
crime
the
honest
man
after
considering
perhaps
considering
how
his
answer
might
affect
the
fruits
of
the
sweat
of
his
brow
replied
unreservedly
i
do
you
implicate
no
other
person
ai
what
i
implicate
it
what
gaffer
implicated
was
the
dogged
and
determined
answer
do
pretend
to
know
more
than
that
his
words
to
me
was
i
done
those
was
his
words
must
see
this
out
mortimer
whispered
eugene
rising
shall
we
go
us
walk
whispered
lightwood
give
this
fellow
time
to
think
of
it
having
exchanged
the
question
and
answer
they
prepared
themselves
for
going
out
and
mr
riderhood
rose
while
extinguishing
the
candles
lightwood
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
took
up
the
glass
from
which
that
honest
gentleman
had
drunk
and
coolly
tossed
it
under
the
grate
where
it
fell
shivering
into
fragments
if
you
will
take
the
lead
said
lightwood
wrayburn
and
i
will
follow
you
know
where
to
go
i
suppose
suppose
i
do
lawyer
lightwood
the
lead
then
the
waterside
character
pulled
his
drowned
cap
over
his
ears
with
both
hands
and
making
himself
more
than
nature
had
made
him
by
the
sullen
and
persistent
slouch
with
which
he
went
went
down
the
stairs
round
by
the
temple
church
across
the
temple
into
whitefriars
and
so
on
by
the
waterside
streets
at
his
air
said
lightwood
following
strikes
me
rather
as
a
air
returned
eugene
has
undeniable
intentions
that
way
they
said
little
else
as
they
followed
he
went
on
before
them
as
an
ugly
fate
might
have
done
and
they
kept
him
in
view
and
would
have
been
glad
enough
to
lose
sight
of
him
but
on
he
went
before
them
always
at
the
same
distance
and
the
same
rate
aslant
against
the
hard
implacable
weather
and
the
rough
wind
he
was
no
more
to
be
driven
back
than
hurried
forward
but
held
on
like
an
advancing
destiny
there
came
when
they
were
about
midway
on
their
journey
a
heavy
rush
of
hail
which
in
a
few
minutes
pelted
the
streets
clear
and
whitened
them
it
made
no
difference
to
him
a
man
life
being
to
be
taken
and
the
price
of
it
got
the
hailstones
to
arrest
the
purpose
must
lie
larger
and
deeper
than
those
he
crashed
through
them
leaving
marks
in
the
slush
that
were
mere
shapeless
holes
one
might
have
fancied
following
that
the
very
fashion
of
humanity
had
departed
from
his
feet
the
blast
went
by
and
the
moon
contended
with
the
clouds
and
the
wild
disorder
reigning
up
there
made
the
pitiful
little
tumults
in
the
streets
of
no
account
it
was
not
that
the
wind
swept
all
the
brawlers
into
places
of
shelter
as
it
had
swept
the
hail
still
lingering
in
heaps
wherever
there
was
refuge
for
it
but
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
streets
were
absorbed
by
the
sky
and
the
night
were
all
in
the
air
he
has
had
time
to
think
of
it
said
eugene
has
not
had
time
to
think
better
of
it
or
differently
of
it
if
that
better
there
is
no
sign
of
drawing
back
in
him
and
as
i
recollect
this
place
we
must
be
close
upon
the
corner
where
we
alighted
that
night
in
fact
a
few
abrupt
turns
brought
them
to
the
river
side
where
they
had
slipped
about
among
the
stones
and
where
they
now
slipped
more
the
wind
coming
against
them
in
slants
and
flaws
across
the
tide
and
the
windings
of
the
river
in
a
furious
way
with
that
habit
of
getting
under
the
lee
of
any
shelter
which
waterside
characters
acquire
the
waterside
character
at
present
in
question
led
the
way
to
the
leeside
of
the
six
jolly
fellowship
porters
before
he
spoke
round
here
lawyer
lightwood
at
them
red
curtains
it
the
fellowships
the
as
i
told
you
would
run
away
and
has
it
run
away
not
showing
himself
much
impressed
by
this
remarkable
confirmation
of
the
informer
evidence
lightwood
inquired
what
other
business
they
had
there
wished
you
to
see
the
fellowships
for
yourself
lawyer
lightwood
that
you
might
judge
whether
i
a
liar
and
now
i
see
window
for
myself
that
we
may
know
whether
he
at
home
with
that
he
crept
away
come
back
i
suppose
murmured
lightwood
and
go
through
with
it
murmured
eugene
he
came
back
after
a
very
short
interval
indeed
out
and
his
boat
out
his
daughter
at
home
sitting
at
the
fire
but
there
some
supper
getting
ready
so
gaffer
expected
i
can
find
what
move
he
upon
easy
enough
presently
then
he
beckoned
and
led
the
way
again
and
they
came
to
the
still
as
clean
and
cool
and
steady
as
before
saving
that
the
flame
of
its
lamp
being
but
a
and
only
attached
to
the
force
as
an
outsider
flickered
in
the
wind
also
within
doors
mr
inspector
was
at
his
studies
as
of
yore
he
recognized
the
friends
the
instant
they
reappeared
but
their
reappearance
had
no
effect
on
his
composure
not
even
the
circumstance
that
riderhood
was
their
conductor
moved
him
otherwise
than
that
as
he
took
a
dip
of
ink
he
seemed
by
a
settlement
of
his
chin
in
his
stock
to
propound
to
that
personage
without
looking
at
him
the
question
have
you
been
up
to
last
mortimer
lightwood
asked
him
would
he
be
so
good
as
look
at
those
notes
handing
him
eugene
having
read
the
first
few
lines
mr
inspector
mounted
to
that
for
him
extraordinary
pitch
of
emotion
that
he
said
either
of
you
two
gentlemen
happen
to
have
a
pinch
of
snuff
about
him
finding
that
neither
had
he
did
quite
as
well
without
it
and
read
on
you
heard
these
read
he
then
demanded
of
the
honest
man
said
riderhood
you
had
better
hear
them
and
so
read
them
aloud
in
an
official
manner
these
notes
correct
now
as
to
the
information
you
bring
here
and
the
evidence
you
mean
to
give
he
asked
when
he
had
finished
reading
are
they
are
as
correct
returned
mr
riderhood
i
am
i
ca
say
more
than
that
for
take
this
man
myself
sir
said
mr
inspector
to
lightwood
then
to
riderhood
he
at
home
where
is
he
what
he
doing
you
have
made
it
your
business
to
know
all
about
him
no
doubt
riderhood
said
what
he
did
know
and
promised
to
find
out
in
a
few
minutes
what
he
did
know
said
mr
inspector
till
i
tell
you
we
must
look
like
business
would
you
two
gentlemen
object
to
making
a
pretence
of
taking
a
glass
of
something
in
my
company
at
the
fellowships
house
and
highly
respectable
landlady
they
replied
that
they
would
be
happy
to
substitute
a
reality
for
the
pretence
which
in
the
main
appeared
to
be
as
one
with
mr
meaning
good
said
he
taking
his
hat
from
its
peg
and
putting
a
pair
of
handcuffs
in
his
pocket
as
if
they
were
his
gloves
reserve
saluted
know
where
to
find
me
reserve
again
saluted
when
you
have
found
out
concerning
his
coming
home
come
round
to
the
window
of
cosy
tap
twice
at
it
and
wait
for
me
now
gentlemen
as
the
three
went
out
together
and
riderhood
slouched
off
from
under
the
trembling
lamp
his
separate
way
lightwood
asked
the
officer
what
he
thought
of
this
mr
inspector
replied
with
due
generality
and
reticence
that
it
was
always
more
likely
that
a
man
had
done
a
bad
thing
than
that
he
had
that
he
himself
had
several
times
up
gaffer
but
had
never
been
able
to
bring
him
to
a
satisfactory
criminal
total
that
if
this
story
was
true
it
was
only
in
part
true
that
the
two
men
very
shy
characters
would
have
been
jointly
and
pretty
equally
it
but
that
this
man
had
the
other
to
save
himself
and
get
the
money
i
think
added
mr
inspector
in
conclusion
if
all
goes
well
with
him
he
in
a
tolerable
way
of
getting
it
but
as
this
is
the
fellowships
gentlemen
where
the
lights
are
i
recommend
dropping
the
subject
you
ca
do
better
than
be
interested
in
some
lime
works
anywhere
down
about
northfleet
and
doubtful
whether
some
of
your
lime
do
get
into
bad
company
as
it
comes
up
in
barges
hear
eugene
said
lightwood
over
his

deeply
interested
in

chapter
tracking
the
bird
of
prey
the
two
lime
merchants
with
their
escort
entered
the
dominions
of
miss
abbey
potterson
to
whom
their
escort
presenting
them
and
their
pretended
business
over
the
of
the
bar
in
a
confidential
way
preferred
his
figurative
request
that
mouthful
of
fire
might
be
lighted
in
cosy
always
well
disposed
to
assist
the
constituted
authorities
miss
abbey
bade
bob
gliddery
attend
the
gentlemen
to
that
retreat
and
promptly
enliven
it
with
fire
and
gaslight
of
this
commission
the
bob
leading
the
way
with
a
flaming
wisp
of
paper
so
speedily
acquitted
himself
that
cosy
seemed
to
leap
out
of
a
dark
sleep
and
embrace
them
warmly
the
moment
they
passed
the
lintels
of
its
hospitable
door
burn
sherry
very
well
here
said
mr
inspector
as
a
piece
of
local
intelligence
you
gentlemen
might
like
a
bottle
the
answer
being
by
all
means
bob
gliddery
received
his
instructions
from
mr
inspector
and
departed
in
a
becoming
state
of
alacrity
engendered
by
reverence
for
the
majesty
of
the
law
a
certain
fact
said
mr
inspector
this
man
we
have
received
our
information
from
indicating
riderhood
with
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
for
some
time
past
given
the
other
man
a
bad
name
arising
out
of
your
lime
barges
and
that
the
other
man
has
been
avoided
in
consequence
i
do
say
what
it
means
or
proves
but
it
a
certain
fact
i
had
it
first
from
one
of
the
opposite
sex
of
my
acquaintance
vaguely
indicating
miss
abbey
with
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
away
at
a
distance
over
yonder
then
probably
mr
inspector
was
not
quite
unprepared
for
their
visit
that
evening
lightwood
hinted
you
see
said
mr
inspector
was
a
question
of
making
a
move
it
of
no
use
moving
if
you
do
know
what
your
move
is
you
had
better
by
far
keep
still
in
the
matter
of
this
lime
i
certainly
had
an
idea
that
it
might
lie
betwixt
the
two
men
i
always
had
that
idea
still
i
was
forced
to
wait
for
a
start
and
i
was
so
lucky
as
to
get
a
start
this
man
that
we
have
received
our
information
from
has
got
a
start
and
if
he
do
meet
with
a
check
he
may
make
the
running
and
come
in
first
there
may
turn
out
to
be
something
considerable
for
him
that
comes
in
second
and
i
do
mention
who
may
or
who
may
not
try
for
that
place
there
duty
to
do
and
i
shall
do
it
under
any
circumstances
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
and
ability
as
a
shipper
of
lime
began
eugene
no
man
has
a
better
right
to
do
than
yourself
you
know
said
mr
inspector
hope
not
said
eugene
father
having
been
a
shipper
of
lime
before
me
and
my
grandfather
before
him
in
fact
we
having
been
a
family
immersed
to
the
crowns
of
our
heads
in
lime
during
several
generations
i
beg
to
observe
that
if
this
missing
lime
could
be
got
hold
of
without
any
young
female
relative
of
any
distinguished
gentleman
engaged
in
the
lime
trade
which
i
cherish
next
to
my
life
being
present
i
think
it
might
be
a
more
agreeable
proceeding
to
the
assisting
bystanders
that
is
to
say
also
said
lightwood
pushing
his
friend
aside
with
a
laugh
much
prefer
that
shall
be
done
gentlemen
if
it
can
be
done
conveniently
said
mr
inspector
with
coolness
is
no
wish
on
my
part
to
cause
any
distress
in
that
quarter
indeed
i
am
sorry
for
that
quarter
was
a
boy
in
that
quarter
remarked
eugene
is
still
there
said
mr
inspector
has
quitted
those
works
he
is
otherwise
disposed
of
she
be
left
alone
then
asked
eugene
will
be
left
said
mr
inspector
bob
reappearance
with
a
steaming
jug
broke
off
the
conversation
but
although
the
jug
steamed
forth
a
delicious
perfume
its
contents
had
not
received
that
last
happy
touch
which
the
surpassing
finish
of
the
six
jolly
fellowship
porters
imparted
on
such
momentous
occasions
bob
carried
in
his
left
hand
one
of
those
iron
models
of
hats
before
mentioned
into
which
he
emptied
the
jug
and
the
pointed
end
of
which
he
thrust
deep
down
into
the
fire
so
leaving
it
for
a
few
moments
while
he
disappeared
and
reappeared
with
three
bright
placing
these
on
the
table
and
bending
over
the
fire
meritoriously
sensible
of
the
trying
nature
of
his
duty
he
watched
the
wreaths
of
steam
until
at
the
special
instant
of
projection
he
caught
up
the
iron
vessel
and
gave
it
one
delicate
twirl
causing
it
to
send
forth
one
gentle
hiss
then
he
restored
the
contents
to
the
jug
held
over
the
steam
of
the
jug
each
of
the
three
bright
glasses
in
succession
finally
filled
them
all
and
with
a
clear
conscience
awaited
the
applause
of
his
it
was
bestowed
mr
inspector
having
proposed
as
an
appropriate
sentiment
lime
trade
and
bob
withdrew
to
report
the
commendations
of
the
guests
to
miss
abbey
in
the
bar
it
may
be
here
in
confidence
admitted
that
the
room
being
close
shut
in
his
absence
there
had
not
appeared
to
be
the
slightest
reason
for
the
elaborate
maintenance
of
this
same
lime
fiction
only
it
had
been
regarded
by
mr
inspector
as
so
uncommonly
satisfactory
and
so
fraught
with
mysterious
virtues
that
neither
of
his
clients
had
presumed
to
question
it
two
taps
were
now
heard
on
the
outside
of
the
window
mr
inspector
hastily
fortifying
himself
with
another
glass
strolled
out
with
a
noiseless
foot
and
an
unoccupied
countenance
as
one
might
go
to
survey
the
weather
and
the
general
aspect
of
the
heavenly
bodies
is
becoming
grim
mortimer
said
eugene
in
a
low
voice
like
this
i
said
lightwood
we
go
here
let
us
stay
you
ought
to
see
it
out
and
i
wo
leave
you
besides
that
lonely
girl
with
the
dark
hair
runs
in
my
head
it
was
little
more
than
a
glimpse
we
had
of
her
that
last
time
and
yet
i
almost
see
her
waiting
by
the
fire
do
you
feel
like
a
dark
combination
of
traitor
and
pickpocket
when
you
think
of
that
girl
returned
lightwood
you
much
so
their
escort
strolled
back
again
and
reported
divested
of
its
various
and
shadows
his
report
went
to
the
effect
that
gaffer
was
away
in
his
boat
supposed
to
be
on
his
old
that
he
had
been
expected
last
that
having
missed
it
for
some
reason
or
other
he
was
not
according
to
his
usual
habits
at
night
to
be
counted
on
before
next
or
it
might
be
an
hour
or
so
later
that
his
daughter
surveyed
through
the
window
would
seem
to
be
so
expecting
him
for
the
supper
was
not
cooking
but
set
out
ready
to
be
cooked
that
it
would
be
at
about
one
and
that
it
was
now
barely
ten
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
watch
and
wait
that
the
informer
was
keeping
watch
at
the
instant
of
that
present
reporting
but
that
two
heads
were
better
than
one
especially
when
the
second
was
mr
inspector
and
that
the
reporter
meant
to
share
the
watch
and
forasmuch
as
crouching
under
the
lee
of
a
boat
on
a
night
when
it
blew
cold
and
strong
and
when
the
weather
was
varied
with
blasts
of
hail
at
times
might
be
wearisome
to
amateurs
the
reporter
closed
with
the
recommendation
that
the
two
gentlemen
should
remain
for
a
while
at
any
rate
in
their
present
quarters
which
were
and
warm
they
were
not
inclined
to
dispute
this
recommendation
but
they
wanted
to
know
where
they
could
join
the
watchers
when
so
disposed
rather
than
trust
to
a
verbal
description
of
the
place
which
might
mislead
eugene
with
a
less
weighty
sense
of
personal
trouble
on
him
than
he
usually
had
would
go
out
with
mr
inspector
note
the
spot
and
come
back
on
the
shelving
bank
of
the
river
among
the
slimy
stones
of
a
causeway
not
the
special
causeway
of
the
six
jolly
fellowships
which
had
a
of
its
own
but
another
a
little
removed
and
very
near
to
the
old
windmill
which
was
the
denounced
were
a
few
boats
some
moored
and
already
beginning
to
float
others
hauled
up
above
the
reach
of
the
tide
under
one
of
these
latter
eugene
companion
disappeared
and
when
eugene
had
observed
its
position
with
reference
to
the
other
boats
and
had
made
sure
that
he
could
not
miss
it
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
the
building
where
as
he
had
been
told
the
lonely
girl
with
the
dark
hair
sat
by
the
fire
he
could
see
the
light
of
the
fire
shining
through
the
window
perhaps
it
drew
him
on
to
look
in
perhaps
he
had
come
out
with
the
express
intention
that
part
of
the
bank
having
rank
grass
growing
on
it
there
was
no
difficulty
in
getting
close
without
any
noise
of
footsteps
it
was
but
to
scramble
up
a
ragged
face
of
pretty
hard
mud
some
three
or
four
feet
high
and
come
upon
the
grass
and
to
the
window
he
came
to
the
window
by
that
means
she
had
no
other
light
than
the
light
of
the
fire
the
unkindled
lamp
stood
on
the
table
she
sat
on
the
ground
looking
at
the
brazier
with
her
face
leaning
on
her
hand
there
was
a
kind
of
film
or
flicker
on
her
face
which
at
first
he
took
to
be
the
fitful
firelight
but
on
a
second
look
he
saw
that
she
was
weeping
a
sad
and
solitary
spectacle
as
shown
him
by
the
rising
and
the
falling
of
the
fire
it
was
a
little
window
of
but
four
pieces
of
glass
and
was
not
curtained
he
chose
it
because
the
larger
window
near
it
was
it
showed
him
the
room
and
the
bills
upon
the
wall
respecting
the
drowned
people
starting
out
and
receding
by
turns
but
he
glanced
slightly
at
them
though
he
looked
long
and
steadily
at
her
a
deep
rich
piece
of
colour
with
the
brown
flush
of
her
cheek
and
the
shining
lustre
of
her
hair
though
sad
and
solitary
weeping
by
the
rising
and
the
falling
of
the
fire
she
started
up
he
had
been
so
very
still
that
he
felt
sure
it
was
not
he
who
had
disturbed
her
so
merely
withdrew
from
the
window
and
stood
near
it
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
she
opened
the
door
and
said
in
an
alarmed
tone
was
that
you
calling
me
and
again
and
once
again
after
listening
i
thought
i
heard
you
call
me
twice
before
no
response
as
she
at
the
door
he
dropped
over
the
bank
and
made
his
way
back
among
the
ooze
and
near
the
to
mortimer
lightwood
to
whom
he
told
what
he
had
seen
of
the
girl
and
how
this
was
becoming
very
grim
indeed
the
real
man
feels
as
guilty
as
i
do
said
eugene
is
remarkably
uncomfortable
of
secrecy
suggested
lightwood
am
not
at
all
obliged
to
it
for
making
me
guy
fawkes
in
the
vault
and
a
sneak
in
the
area
both
at
once
said
eugene
me
some
more
of
that
stuff
lightwood
helped
him
to
some
more
of
that
stuff
but
it
had
been
cooling
and
did
answer
now
said
eugene
spitting
it
out
among
the
ashes
like
the
wash
of
the
river
you
so
familiar
with
the
flavour
of
the
wash
of
the
river
seem
to
be
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
half
drowned
and
swallowing
a
gallon
of
it
of
locality
suggested
lightwood
are
mighty
learned
you
and
your
influences
returned
eugene
long
shall
we
stay
here
long
do
you
think
i
could
choose
i
should
say
a
minute
replied
eugene
the
jolly
fellowship
porters
are
not
the
jolliest
dogs
i
have
known
but
i
suppose
we
are
best
here
until
they
turn
us
out
with
the
other
suspicious
characters
at
midnight
thereupon
he
stirred
the
fire
and
sat
down
on
one
side
of
it
it
struck
eleven
and
he
made
believe
to
compose
himself
patiently
but
gradually
he
took
the
fidgets
in
one
leg
and
then
in
the
other
leg
and
then
in
one
arm
and
then
in
the
other
arm
and
then
in
his
chin
and
then
in
his
back
and
then
in
his
forehead
and
then
in
his
hair
and
then
in
his
nose
and
then
he
stretched
himself
recumbent
on
two
chairs
and
groaned
and
then
he
started
up
insects
of
diabolical
activity
swarm
in
this
place
i
am
tickled
and
twitched
all
over
mentally
i
have
now
committed
a
burglary
under
the
meanest
circumstances
and
the
myrmidons
of
justice
are
at
my
heels
am
quite
as
bad
said
lightwood
sitting
up
facing
him
with
a
tumbled
head
after
going
through
some
wonderful
evolutions
in
which
his
head
had
been
the
lowest
part
of
him
restlessness
began
with
me
long
ago
all
the
time
you
were
out
i
felt
like
gulliver
with
the
lilliputians
firing
upon
him
wo
do
mortimer
we
must
get
into
the
air
we
must
join
our
dear
friend
and
brother
riderhood
and
let
us
tranquillize
ourselves
by
making
a
compact
next
time
with
a
view
to
our
peace
of
mind
commit
the
crime
instead
of
taking
the
criminal
you
swear
it
let
tippins
look
to
it
her
life
in
danger
mortimer
rang
the
bell
to
pay
the
score
and
bob
appeared
to
transact
that
business
with
him
whom
eugene
in
his
careless
extravagance
asked
if
he
would
like
a
situation
in
the
sir
no
sir
said
bob
a
good
sitiwation
here
sir
you
change
your
mind
at
any
time
returned
eugene
to
me
at
my
works
and
you
always
find
an
opening
in
the
sir
said
bob
is
my
partner
said
eugene
keeps
the
books
and
attends
to
the
wages
a
fair
day
wages
for
a
fair
day
work
is
ever
my
motto
a
very
good
it
is
gentlemen
said
bob
receiving
his
fee
and
drawing
a
bow
out
of
his
head
with
his
right
hand
very
much
as
he
would
have
drawn
a
pint
of
beer
out
of
the
beer
engine
mortimer
apostrophized
him
laughing
quite
heartily
when
they
were
alone
again
can
you
be
so
ridiculous
am
in
a
ridiculous
humour
quoth
eugene
am
a
ridiculous
fellow
everything
is
ridiculous
come
along
it
passed
into
mortimer
lightwood
mind
that
a
change
of
some
sort
best
expressed
perhaps
as
an
intensification
of
all
that
was
wildest
and
most
negligent
and
reckless
in
his
friend
had
come
upon
him
in
the
last
or
so
thoroughly
used
to
him
as
he
was
he
found
something
new
and
strained
in
him
that
was
for
the
moment
perplexing
this
passed
into
his
mind
and
passed
out
again
but
he
remembered
it
afterwards
where
she
sits
you
see
said
eugene
when
they
were
standing
under
the
bank
roared
and
riven
at
by
the
wind
the
light
of
her
fire
take
a
peep
through
the
window
said
mortimer
do
eugene
caught
him
by
the
arm
not
make
a
show
of
her
come
to
our
honest
friend
he
led
him
to
the
post
of
watch
and
they
both
dropped
down
and
crept
under
the
lee
of
the
boat
a
better
shelter
than
it
had
seemed
before
being
directly
contrasted
with
the
blowing
wind
and
the
bare
night
inspector
at
home
whispered
eugene
i
am
sir
our
friend
of
the
perspiring
brow
is
at
the
far
corner
there
good
anything
happened
daughter
has
been
out
thinking
she
heard
him
calling
unless
it
was
a
sign
to
him
to
keep
out
of
the
way
it
might
have
been
might
have
been
rule
britannia
muttered
eugene
it
was
mortimer
on
the
other
side
of
mr
inspector
burglaries
now
and
a
forgery
with
this
indication
of
his
depressed
state
of
mind
eugene
fell
silent
they
were
all
silent
for
a
long
while
as
it
got
to
be
and
the
water
came
nearer
to
them
noises
on
the
river
became
more
frequent
and
they
listened
more
to
the
turning
of
to
the
clinking
of
iron
chain
to
the
creaking
of
blocks
to
the
measured
working
of
oars
to
the
occasional
violent
barking
of
some
passing
dog
on
shipboard
who
seemed
to
scent
them
lying
in
their
the
night
was
not
so
dark
but
that
besides
the
lights
at
bows
and
mastheads
gliding
to
and
fro
they
could
discern
some
shadowy
bulk
attached
and
now
and
then
a
ghostly
lighter
with
a
large
dark
sail
like
a
warning
arm
would
start
up
very
near
them
pass
on
and
vanish
at
this
time
of
their
watch
the
water
close
to
them
would
be
often
agitated
by
some
impulsion
given
it
from
a
distance
often
they
believed
this
beat
and
plash
to
be
the
boat
they
lay
in
wait
for
running
in
ashore
and
again
and
again
they
would
have
started
up
but
for
the
immobility
with
which
the
informer
well
used
to
the
river
kept
quiet
in
his
place
the
wind
carried
away
the
striking
of
the
great
multitude
of
city
church
clocks
for
those
lay
to
leeward
of
them
but
there
were
bells
to
windward
that
told
them
of
its
being
one
two
three
without
that
aid
they
would
have
known
how
the
night
wore
by
the
falling
of
the
tide
recorded
in
the
appearance
of
an
black
wet
strip
of
shore
and
the
emergence
of
the
paved
causeway
from
the
river
foot
by
foot
as
the
time
so
passed
this
slinking
business
became
a
more
and
more
precarious
one
it
would
seem
as
if
the
man
had
had
some
intimation
of
what
was
in
hand
against
him
or
had
taken
fright
his
movements
might
have
been
planned
to
gain
for
him
in
getting
beyond
their
reach
twelve
hours
advantage
the
honest
man
who
had
expended
the
sweat
of
his
brow
became
uneasy
and
began
to
complain
with
bitterness
of
the
proneness
of
mankind
to
cheat
him
him
invested
with
the
dignity
of
labour
their
retreat
was
so
chosen
that
while
they
could
watch
the
river
they
could
watch
the
house
no
one
had
passed
in
or
out
since
the
daughter
thought
she
heard
the
father
calling
no
one
could
pass
in
or
out
without
being
seen
it
will
be
light
at
five
said
mr
inspector
then
we
shall
be
seen
here
said
riderhood
do
you
say
to
this
he
may
have
been
lurking
in
and
out
and
just
holding
his
own
betwixt
two
or
three
bridges
for
hours
back
do
you
make
of
that
said
mr
inspector
stoical
but
contradictory
may
be
doing
so
at
this
present
time
do
you
make
of
that
said
mr
inspector
boat
among
them
boats
here
at
the
what
do
you
make
of
your
boat
said
mr
inspector
if
i
put
off
in
her
and
take
a
look
round
i
know
his
ways
and
the
likely
nooks
he
favours
i
know
where
he
be
at
such
a
time
of
the
tide
and
where
he
be
at
such
another
time
ai
i
been
his
pardner
none
of
you
need
show
none
of
you
need
stir
i
can
shove
her
off
without
help
and
as
to
me
being
seen
i
about
at
all
times
might
have
given
a
worse
opinion
said
mr
inspector
after
brief
consideration
it
a
bit
let
work
it
out
if
i
want
you
i
drop
round
under
the
fellowships
and
tip
you
a
whistle
i
might
so
far
presume
as
to
offer
a
suggestion
to
my
honourable
and
gallant
friend
whose
knowledge
of
naval
matters
far
be
it
from
me
to
impeach
eugene
struck
in
with
great
deliberation
would
be
that
to
tip
a
whistle
is
to
advertise
mystery
and
invite
speculation
my
honourable
and
gallant
friend
will
i
trust
excuse
me
as
an
independent
member
for
throwing
out
a
remark
which
i
feel
to
be
due
to
this
house
and
the
country
that
the
governor
or
lawyer
lightwood
asked
riderhood
for
they
spoke
as
they
crouched
or
lay
without
seeing
one
faces
reply
to
the
question
put
by
my
honourable
and
gallant
friend
said
eugene
who
was
lying
on
his
back
with
his
hat
on
his
face
as
an
attitude
highly
expressive
of
watchfulness
can
have
no
hesitation
in
replying
it
not
being
inconsistent
with
the
public
service
that
those
accents
were
the
accents
of
the
governor
tolerable
good
eyes
ai
you
governor
you
all
tolerable
good
eyes
ai
you
demanded
the
informer
all
if
i
row
up
under
the
fellowship
and
lay
there
no
need
to
whistle
you
make
out
that
there
a

another

you

then
in
a
moment
with
the

cutting
keenly
at

sideways
he
was
staggering
down
to
his
boat
in
a
few
moments
he
was
clear
and
creeping
up
the

own
shore

himself
on

elbow
to

into

darkness

forgeries
and
a

assassination
yet
in
spite
of
having
those
weights
on
his
conscience
eugene
was
somewhat
enlivened
by
the
late
slight
change
in
the
circumstances
of
affairs
so
were
his
two
companions
its
being
a
change
was
everything
the
suspense
seemed
to
have
taken
a
new
lease
and
to
have
begun
afresh
from
a
recent
date
there
was
something
additional
to
look
for
they
were
all
three
more
sharply
on
the
alert
and
less
deadened
by
the
miserable
influences
of
the
place
and
time
more
than
an
hour
had
passed
and
they
were
even
dozing
when
one
of
the
three
each
said
it
was
he
and
he
had
not
dozed
made
out
riderhood
in
his
boat
at
the
spot
agreed
on
they
sprang
up
came
out
from
their
shelter
and
went
down
to
him
when
he
saw
them
coming
he
dropped
alongside
the
causeway
so
that
they
standing
on
the
causeway
could
speak
with
him
in
whispers
under
the
shadowy
mass
of
the
six
jolly

porters
fast
asleep

i
can

it
out

at

staring
at

in

way

his

empty

and
what
more
with
one
scull
gone

what

with
scull
jammed
in

off

hours
when
the
vital
force

things

at
the
blank
face
of
riderhood
in
his
boat
boat
gaffer
in
luck
again
and
yet
no
gaffer
so
spake
riderhood
staring
disconsolate
as
if
with
one
accord
they
all
turned
their
eyes
towards
the
light
of
the
fire
shining
through
the
window
it
was
fainter
and
duller
perhaps
fire
like
the
higher
animal
and
vegetable
life
it
helps
to
sustain
has
its
greatest
tendency
towards
death
when
the
night
is
dying
and
the
day
is
not
yet
born
it
was
me
that
had
the
law
of
this
here
job
in
hand
growled
riderhood
with
a
threatening
shake
of
his
head
if
i
would
lay
hold
of
her
at
any
rate
but
it
is
not
you
said
eugene
with
something
so
suddenly
fierce
in
him
that
the
informer
returned
submissively
well
well
governor
i
did
say
it
was
a
man
may
speak
vermin
may
be
silent
said
eugene
your
tongue
you
astonished
by
his
friend
unusual
heat
lightwood
stared
too
and
then
said
can
have
become
of
this
man
imagine
unless
he
dived
overboard
the
informer
wiped
his
brow
ruefully
as
he
said
it
sitting
in
his
boat
and
always
staring
disconsolate
you
make
his
boat
fast
fast
enough
till
the
tide
runs
back
i
could
make
her
faster
than
she
is
come
aboard
of
mine
and
see
for
your
there
was
a
little
backwardness
in
complying
for
the
freight
looked
too
much
for
the
boat
but
on
riderhood
protesting
he
had
had
half
a
dozen
dead
and
alive
in
her
afore
now
and
she
was
nothing
deep
in
the
water
nor
down
in
the
stern
even
then
to
speak
of
they
carefully
took
their
places
and
trimmed
the
crazy
thing
while
they
were
doing
so
riderhood
still
sat
staring
disconsolate
right
give
way
said
lightwood
way
by
george
repeated
riderhood
before
shoving
off
gone
and
made
off
any
how
lawyer
lightwood
it
enough
to
make
me
give
way
in
a
different
manner
but
he
always
was
a
cheat
him
he
always
was
a
infernal
cheat
was
gaffer
nothing
nothing
on
the
square
so
mean
so
underhanded
never
going
through
with
a
thing
nor
carrying
it
out
like
a
man
steady
cried
eugene
he
had
recovered
immediately
on
embarking
as
they
bumped
heavily
against
a
pile
and
then
in
a
lower
voice
reversed
his
late
apostrophe
by
remarking
wish
the
boat
of
my
honourable
and
gallant
friend
may
be
endowed
with
philanthropy
enough
not
to
turn
and
extinguish
us
steady
steady
sit
close
mortimer
here
the
hail
again
see
how
it
flies
like
a
troop
of
wild
cats
at
mr
riderhood
eyes
indeed
he
had
the
full
benefit
of
it
and
it
so
mauled
him
though
he
bent
his
head
low
and
tried
to
present
nothing
but
the
mangy
cap
to
it
that
he
dropped
under
the
lee
of
a
tier
of
shipping
and
they
lay
there
until
it
was
over
the
squall
had
come
up
like
a
spiteful
messenger
before
the
morning
there
followed
in
its
wake
a
ragged
tear
of
light
which
ripped
the
dark
clouds
until
they
showed
a
great
grey
hole
of
day
they
were
all
shivering
and
everything
about
them
seemed
to
be
shivering
the
river
itself
craft
rigging
sails
such
early
smoke
as
there
yet
was
on
the
shore
black
with
wet
and
altered
to
the
eye
by
white
patches
of
hail
and
sleet
the
huddled
buildings
looked
lower
than
usual
as
if
they
were
cowering
and
had
shrunk
with
the
cold
very
little
life
was
to
be
seen
on
either
bank
windows
and
doors
were
shut
and
the
staring
black
and
white
letters
upon
wharves
and
warehouses
said
eugene
to
mortimer
inscriptions
over
the
graves
of
dead
businesses
as
they
glided
slowly
on
keeping
under
the
shore
and
sneaking
in
and
out
among
the
shipping
by
of
water
in
a
pilfering
way
that
seemed
to
be
their
boatman
normal
manner
of
progression
all
the
objects
among
which
they
crept
were
so
huge
in
contrast
with
their
wretched
boat
as
to
threaten
to
crush
it
not
a
ship
hull
with
its
rusty
iron
links
of
cable
run
out
of
long
discoloured
with
the
iron
rusty
tears
but
seemed
to
be
there
with
a
fell
intention
not
a
but
had
the
menacing
look
of
bursting
forward
to
run
them
down
not
a
sluice
gate
or
a
painted
scale
upon
a
post
or
wall
showing
the
depth
of
water
but
seemed
to
hint
like
the
dreadfully
facetious
wolf
in
bed
in
grandmamma
cottage
to
drown
you
in
my
dears
not
a
lumbering
black
barge
with
its
cracked
and
blistered
side
impending
over
them
but
seemed
to
suck
at
the
river
with
a
thirst
for
sucking
them
under
and
everything
so
vaunted
the
spoiling
influences
of
water
discoloured
copper
rotten
wood
stone
green
dank
deposit
that
the
of
being
crushed
sucked
under
and
drawn
down
looked
as
ugly
to
the
imagination
as
the
main
event
some
of
this
work
and
riderhood
unshipped
his
sculls
stood
holding
on
to
a
barge
and
hand
over
hand
along
the
side
gradually
worked
his
boat
under
her
head
into
a
secret
little
nook
of
scummy
water
and
driven
into
that
nook
and
wedged
as
he
had
described
was
gaffer
boat
that
boat
with
the
stain
still
in
it
bearing
some
resemblance
to
a
muffled
human
form
tell
me
i
a
liar
said
the
honest
man
a
morbid
expectation
murmured
eugene
to
lightwood
somebody
is
always
going
to
tell
him
the
truth
is
hexam
boat
said
mr
inspector
know
her
well
at
the
broken
scull
look
at
the
scull
gone
now
tell
me
i
am
a
liar
said
the
honest
man
mr
inspector
stepped
into
the
boat
eugene
and
mortimer
looked
on
see
now
added
riderhood
creeping
aft
and
showing
a
stretched
rope
made
fast
there
and
towing
overboard
i
tell
you
he
was
in
luck
again
in
said
mr
inspector
to
say
haul
in
answered
riderhood
so
easy
done
his
got
fouled
under
the
keels
of
the
barges
i
tried
to
haul
in
last
time
but
i
could
see
how
taut
the
line
is
must
have
it
up
said
mr
inspector
am
going
to
take
this
boat
ashore
and
his
luck
along
with
it
try
easy
now
he
tried
easy
now
but
the
luck
resisted
would
come
mean
to
have
it
and
the
boat
too
said
mr
inspector
playing
the
line
but
still
the
luck
resisted
would
come
care
said
riderhood
disfigure
or
pull
asunder
perhaps
am
not
going
to
do
either
not
even
to
your
grandmother
said
mr
inspector
i
mean
to
have
it
come
he
added
at
once
persuasively
and
with
authority
to
the
hidden
object
in
the
water
as
he
played
the
line
again
no
good
this
sort
of
game
you
know
you
must
come
up
i
mean
to
have
you
there
was
so
much
virtue
in
this
distinctly
and
decidedly
meaning
to
have
it
that
it
yielded
a
little
even
while
the
line
was
played
told
you
so
quoth
mr
inspector
pulling
off
his
outer
coat
and
leaning
well
over
the
stern
with
a
will
it
was
an
awful
sort
of
fishing
but
it
no
more
disconcerted
mr
inspector
than
if
he
had
been
fishing
in
a
punt
on
a
summer
evening
by
some
soothing
weir
high
up
the
peaceful
river
after
certain
minutes
and
a
few
directions
to
the
rest
to
her
a
little
and
ease
her
a
trifle
aft
and
the
like
he
said
composedly
clear
and
the
line
and
the
boat
came
free
together
accepting
lightwood
proffered
hand
to
help
him
up
he
then
put
on
his
coat
and
said
to
riderhood
me
over
those
spare
sculls
of
yours
and
i
pull
this
in
to
the
nearest
stairs
go
ahead
you
and
keep
out
in
pretty
open
water
that
i
may
get
fouled
again
his
directions
were
obeyed
and
they
pulled
ashore
directly
two
in
one
boat
two
in
the
other
said
mr
inspector
again
to
riderhood
when
they
were
all
on
the
slushy
stones
have
had
more
practice
in
this
than
i
have
had
and
ought
to
be
a
better
workman
at
it
undo
the
and
we
help
you
haul
in
riderhood
got
into
the
boat
accordingly
it
appeared
as
if
he
had
scarcely
had
a
moment
time
to
touch
the
rope
or
look
over
the
stern
when
he
came
scrambling
back
as
pale
as
the
morning
and
gasped
out
the
lord
he
done
me
do
you
mean
they
all
demanded
he
pointed
behind
him
at
the
boat
and
gasped
to
that
degree
that
he
dropped
upon
the
stones
to
get
his
breath
done
me
it
gaffer
they
ran
to
the
rope
leaving
him
gasping
there
soon
the
form
of
the
bird
of
prey
dead
some
hours
lay
stretched
upon
the
shore
with
a
new
blast
storming
at
it
and
clotting
the
wet
hair
with
father
was
that
you
calling
me
father
i
thought
i
heard
you
call
me
twice
before
words
never
to
be
answered
those
upon
the
of
the
grave
the
wind
sweeps
jeeringly
over
father
whips
him
with
the
frayed
ends
of
his
dress
and
his
jagged
hair
tries
to
turn
him
where
he
lies
stark
on
his
back
and
force
his
face
towards
the
rising
sun
that
he
may
be
shamed
the
more
a
lull
and
the
wind
is
secret
and
prying
with
him
lifts
and
lets
falls
a
rag
hides
palpitating
under
another
rag
runs
nimbly
through
his
hair
and
beard
then
in
a
rush
it
cruelly
taunts
him
father
was
that
you
calling
me
was
it
you
the
voiceless
and
the
dead
was
it
you
thus
buffeted
as
you
lie
here
in
a
heap
was
it
you
thus
baptized
unto
death
with
these
flying
impurities
now
flung
upon
your
face
why
not
speak
father
soaking
into
this
filthy
ground
as
you
lie
here
is
your
own
shape
did
you
never
see
such
a
shape
soaked
into
your
boat
speak
father
speak
to
us
the
winds
the
only
listeners
left
you
see
said
mr
inspector
after
mature
deliberation
kneeling
on
one
knee
beside
the
body
when
they
had
stood
looking
down
on
the
drowned
man
as
he
had
many
a
time
looked
down
on
many
another
man
way
of
it
was
this
of
course
you
gentlemen
hardly
failed
to
observe
that
he
was
towing
by
the
neck
and
arms
they
had
helped
to
release
the
rope
and
of
course
not
you
will
have
observed
before
and
you
will
observe
now
that
this
knot
which
was
drawn
round
his
neck
by
the
strain
of
his
own
arms
is
a
holding
it
up
for
demonstration
plain
enough
you
will
have
observed
how
he
had
run
the
other
end
of
this
rope
to
his
boat
it
had
the
curves
and
indentations
in
it
still
where
it
had
been
twined
and
bound
see
said
mr
inspector
how
it
works
round
upon
him
it
a
wild
tempestuous
evening
when
this
man
that
was
stooping
to
wipe
some
hailstones
out
of
his
hair
with
an
end
of
his
own
drowned
jacket
there
now
he
more
like
himself
though
he
badly
bruised
when
this
man
that
was
rows
out
upon
the
river
on
his
usual
lay
he
carries
with
him
this
coil
of
rope
he
always
carries
with
him
this
coil
of
rope
it
as
well
known
to
me
as
he
was
himself
sometimes
it
lay
in
the
bottom
of
his
boat
sometimes
he
hung
it
loose
round
his
neck
he
was
a
was
this
man
you
see
lifting
the
loose
neckerchief
over
his
breast
and
taking
the
opportunity
of
wiping
the
dead
lips
with
it
when
it
was
wet
or
freezing
or
blew
cold
he
would
hang
this
coil
of
line
round
his
neck
last
evening
he
does
this
worse
for
him
he
dodges
about
in
his
boat
does
this
man
till
he
gets
chilled
his
hands
taking
up
one
of
them
which
dropped
like
a
leaden
weight
numbed
he
sees
some
object
that
in
his
way
of
business
floating
he
makes
ready
to
secure
that
object
he
unwinds
the
end
of
his
coil
that
he
wants
to
take
some
turns
on
in
his
boat
and
he
takes
turns
enough
on
it
to
secure
that
it
sha
run
out
he
makes
it
too
secure
as
it
happens
he
is
a
little
longer
about
this
than
usual
his
hands
being
numbed
his
object
drifts
up
before
he
is
quite
ready
for
it
he
catches
at
it
thinks
he
make
sure
of
the
contents
of
the
pockets
anyhow
in
case
he
should
be
parted
from
it
bends
right
over
the
stern
and
in
one
of
these
heavy
squalls
or
in
the
of
two
steamers
or
in
not
being
quite
prepared
or
through
all
or
most
or
some
gets
a
lurch
overbalances
and
goes
overboard
now
see
he
can
swim
can
this
man
and
instantly
he
strikes
out
but
in
such
he
tangles
his
arms
pulls
strong
on
the
and
it
runs
home
the
object
he
had
expected
to
take
in
tow
floats
by
and
his
own
boat
tows
him
dead
to
where
we
found
him
all
entangled
in
his
own
line
you
ask
me
how
i
make
out
about
the
pockets
first
i
tell
you
more
there
was
silver
in
how
do
i
make
that
out
simple
and
satisfactory
because
he
got
it
here
the
lecturer
held
up
the
tightly
clenched
right
hand
is
to
be
done
with
the
remains
asked
lightwood
you
would
object
to
standing
by
him
half
a
minute
sir
was
the
reply
find
the
nearest
of
our
men
to
come
and
take
charge
of
him
i
still
call
it
him
you
see
said
mr
inspector
looking
back
as
he
went
with
a
philosophical
smile
upon
the
force
of
habit
said
lightwood
and
was
about
to
add
may
wait
at
a
little
distance
when
turning
his
head
he
found
that
no
eugene
was
there
he
raised
his
voice
and
called
holloa
but
no
eugene
replied
it
was
broad
daylight
now
and
he
looked
about
but
no
eugene
was
in
all
the
view
mr
inspector
speedily
returning
down
the
wooden
stairs
with
a
police
constable
lightwood
asked
him
if
he
had
seen
his
friend
leave
them
mr
inspector
could
not
exactly
say
that
he
had
seen
him
go
but
had
noticed
that
he
was
restless
and
entertaining
combination
sir
your
friend
wish
it
had
not
been
a
part
of
his
singular
entertaining
combination
to
give
me
the
slip
under
these
dreary
circumstances
at
this
time
of
the
morning
said
lightwood
we
get
anything
hot
to
drink
we
could
and
we
did
in
a
kitchen
with
a
large
fire
we
got
hot
brandy
and
water
and
it
revived
us
wonderfully
mr
inspector
having
to
mr
riderhood
announced
his
official
intention
of
his
eye
upon
him
stood
him
in
a
corner
of
the
fireplace
like
a
wet
umbrella
and
took
no
further
outward
and
visible
notice
of
that
honest
man
except
ordering
a
separate
service
of
brandy
and
water
for
him
apparently
out
of
the
public
funds
as
mortimer
lightwood
sat
before
the
blazing
fire
conscious
of
drinking
brandy
and
water
then
and
there
in
his
sleep
and
yet
at
one
and
the
same
time
drinking
burnt
sherry
at
the
six
jolly
fellowships
and
lying
under
the
boat
on
the
river
shore
and
sitting
in
the
boat
that
riderhood
rowed
and
listening
to
the
lecture
recently
concluded
and
having
to
dine
in
the
temple
with
an
unknown
man
who
described
himself
as
eugene
gaffer
harmon
and
said
he
lived
at
hailstorm
as
he
passed
through
these
curious
vicissitudes
of
fatigue
and
slumber
arranged
upon
the
scale
of
a
dozen
hours
to
the
second
he
became
aware
of
answering
aloud
a
communication
of
pressing
importance
that
had
never
been
made
to
him
and
then
turned
it
into
a
cough
on
beholding
mr
inspector
for
he
felt
with
some
natural
indignation
that
that
functionary
might
otherwise
suspect
him
of
having
closed
his
eyes
or
wandered
in
his
attention
just
before
us
you
see
said
mr
inspector
see
said
lightwood
with
dignity
had
hot
brandy
and
water
too
you
see
said
mr
inspector
then
cut
off
at
a
great
rate
said
lightwood
friend
you
know
know
he
replied
again
with
dignity
after
hearing
in
a
mist
through
which
mr
inspector
loomed
vague
and
large
that
the
officer
took
upon
himself
to
prepare
the
dead
daughter
for
what
had
befallen
in
the
night
and
generally
that
he
took
everything
upon
himself
mortimer
lightwood
stumbled
in
his
sleep
to
a
called
a
cab
and
had
entered
the
army
and
committed
a
capital
military
offence
and
been
tried
by
court
martial
and
found
guilty
and
had
arranged
his
affairs
and
been
marched
out
to
be
shot
before
the
door
banged
hard
work
rowing
the
cab
through
the
city
to
the
temple
for
a
cup
of
from
five
to
ten
thousand
pounds
value
given
by
mr
boffin
and
hard
work
holding
forth
at
that
immeasurable
length
to
eugene
when
he
had
been
rescued
with
a
rope
from
the
running
pavement
for
making
off
in
that
extraordinary
manner
but
he
offered
such
ample
apologies
and
was
so
very
penitent
that
when
lightwood
got
out
of
the
cab
he
gave
the
driver
a
particular
charge
to
be
careful
of
him
which
the
driver
knowing
there
was
no
other
fare
left
inside
stared
at
prodigiously
in
short
the
night
work
had
so
exhausted
and
worn
out
this
actor
in
it
that
he
had
become
a
mere
somnambulist
he
was
too
tired
to
rest
in
his
sleep
until
he
was
even
tired
out
of
being
too
tired
and
dropped
into
oblivion
late
in
the
afternoon
he
awoke
and
in
some
anxiety
sent
round
to
eugene
lodging
hard
by
to
inquire
if
he
were
up
yet
oh
yes
he
was
up
in
fact
he
had
not
been
to
bed
he
had
just
come
home
and
here
he
was
close
following
on
the
heels
of
the
message
what
bloodshot
draggled
dishevelled
spectacle
is
this
cried
mortimer
my
feathers
so
very
much
rumpled
said
eugene
coolly
going
up
to
the
they
are
rather
out
of
sorts
but
consider
such
a
night
for
plumage
a
night
repeated
mortimer
became
of
you
in
the
morning
dear
fellow
said
eugene
sitting
on
his
bed
felt
that
we
had
bored
one
another
so
long
that
an
unbroken
continuance
of
those
relations
must
inevitably
terminate
in
our
flying
to
opposite
points
of
the
earth
i
also
felt
that
i
had
committed
every
crime
in
the
newgate
calendar
so
for
mingled
considerations
of
friendship
and
felony
i
took
a
walk
chapter
two
new
servants
mr
and
mrs
boffin
sat
after
breakfast
in
the
bower
a
prey
to
prosperity
mr
boffin
face
denoted
care
and
complication
many
disordered
papers
were
before
him
and
he
looked
at
them
about
as
hopefully
as
an
innocent
civilian
might
look
at
a
crowd
of
troops
whom
he
was
required
at
five
minutes
notice
to
manoeuvre
and
review
he
had
been
engaged
in
some
attempts
to
make
notes
of
these
papers
but
being
troubled
as
men
of
his
stamp
often
are
with
an
exceedingly
distrustful
and
corrective
thumb
that
busy
member
had
so
often
interposed
to
smear
his
notes
that
they
were
little
more
legible
than
the
various
impressions
of
itself
which
blurred
his
nose
and
forehead
it
is
curious
to
consider
in
such
a
case
as
mr
boffin
what
a
cheap
article
ink
is
and
how
far
it
may
be
made
to
go
as
a
grain
of
musk
will
scent
a
drawer
for
many
years
and
still
lose
nothing
appreciable
of
its
original
weight
so
a
of
ink
would
blot
mr
boffin
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
and
the
calves
of
his
legs
without
inscribing
a
line
on
the
paper
before
him
or
appearing
to
diminish
in
the
inkstand
mr
boffin
was
in
such
severe
literary
difficulties
that
his
eyes
were
prominent
and
fixed
and
his
breathing
was
stertorous
when
to
the
great
relief
of
mrs
boffin
who
observed
these
symptoms
with
alarm
the
yard
bell
rang
that
i
wonder
said
mrs
boffin
mr
boffin
drew
a
long
breath
laid
down
his
pen
looked
at
his
notes
as
doubting
whether
he
had
the
pleasure
of
their
acquaintance
and
appeared
on
a
second
perusal
of
their
countenances
to
be
confirmed
in
his
impression
that
he
had
not
when
there
was
announced
by
the
young
man
rokesmith
said
mr
boffin
indeed
our
and
the
wilfers
mutual
friend
my
dear
yes
ask
him
to
come
in
mr
rokesmith
appeared
down
sir
said
mr
boffin
shaking
hands
with
him
boffin
you
already
acquainted
with
well
sir
i
am
rather
unprepared
to
see
you
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
been
so
busy
with
one
thing
and
another
that
i
not
had
time
to
turn
your
offer
over
apology
for
both
of
us
for
mr
boffin
and
for
me
as
well
said
the
smiling
mrs
boffin
lor
we
can
talk
it
over
now
ca
us
mr
rokesmith
bowed
thanked
her
and
said
he
hoped
so
me
see
then
resumed
mr
boffin
with
his
hand
to
his
chin
was
secretary
that
you
named
was
it
said
secretary
assented
mr
rokesmith
rather
puzzled
me
at
the
time
said
mr
boffin
it
rather
puzzled
me
and
mrs
boffin
when
we
spoke
of
it
afterwards
because
not
to
make
a
mystery
of
our
belief
we
have
always
believed
a
secretary
to
be
a
piece
of
furniture
mostly
of
mahogany
lined
with
green
baize
or
leather
with
a
lot
of
little
drawers
in
it
now
you
wo
think
i
take
a
liberty
when
i
mention
that
you
certainly
ai
that
certainly
not
said
mr
rokesmith
but
he
had
used
the
word
in
the
sense
of
steward
as
to
steward
you
see
returned
mr
boffin
with
his
hand
still
to
his
chin
odds
are
that
mrs
boffin
and
me
may
never
go
upon
the
water
being
both
bad
sailors
we
should
want
a
steward
if
we
did
but
there
generally
one
provided
mr
rokesmith
again
explained
defining
the
duties
he
sought
to
undertake
as
those
of
general
superintendent
or
manager
or
overlooker
or
man
of
business
for
instance
come
said
mr
boffin
in
his
pouncing
way
you
entered
my
employment
what
would
you
do
would
keep
exact
accounts
of
all
the
expenditure
you
sanctioned
mr
boffin
i
would
write
your
letters
under
your
direction
i
would
transact
your
business
with
people
in
your
pay
or
employment
i
would
with
a
glance
and
a
at
the
table
your
papers
mr
boffin
rubbed
his
inky
ear
and
looked
at
his
and
so
arrange
them
as
to
have
them
always
in
order
for
immediate
reference
with
a
note
of
the
contents
of
each
outside
it
tell
you
what
said
mr
boffin
slowly
crumpling
his
own
blotted
note
in
his
hand
you
turn
to
at
these
present
papers
and
see
what
you
can
make
of
i
shall
know
better
what
i
can
make
of
you
no
sooner
said
than
done
relinquishing
his
hat
and
gloves
mr
rokesmith
sat
down
quietly
at
the
table
arranged
the
open
papers
into
an
orderly
heap
cast
his
eyes
over
each
in
succession
folded
it
docketed
it
on
the
outside
laid
it
in
a
second
heap
and
when
that
second
heap
was
complete
and
the
first
gone
took
from
his
pocket
a
piece
of
string
and
tied
it
together
with
a
remarkably
dexterous
hand
at
a
running
curve
and
a
loop
said
mr
boffin
good
now
let
us
hear
what
they
all
about
will
you
be
so
good
john
rokesmith
read
his
abstracts
aloud
they
were
all
about
the
new
house
decorator
estimate
so
much
furniture
estimate
so
much
estimate
for
furniture
of
offices
so
much
estimate
so
much
estimate
so
much
estimate
so
much
goldsmith
estimate
so
much
total
so
very
much
then
came
correspondence
acceptance
of
mr
boffin
offer
of
such
a
date
and
to
such
an
effect
rejection
of
mr
boffin
proposal
of
such
a
date
and
to
such
an
effect
concerning
mr
boffin
scheme
of
such
another
date
to
such
another
effect
all
compact
and
methodical
order
said
mr
boffin
after
checking
off
each
inscription
with
his
hand
like
a
man
beating
time
whatever
you
do
with
your
ink
i
ca
think
for
you
as
clean
as
a
whistle
after
it
now
as
to
a
letter
let
said
mr
boffin
rubbing
his
hands
in
his
pleasantly
childish
admiration
try
a
letter
next
whom
shall
it
be
addressed
mr
boffin
yourself
mr
rokesmith
quickly
wrote
and
then
read
aloud
mr
boffin
presents
his
compliments
to
mr
john
rokesmith
and
begs
to
say
that
he
has
decided
on
giving
mr
john
rokesmith
a
trial
in
the
capacity
he
desires
to
fill
mr
boffin
takes
mr
john
rokesmith
at
his
word
in
postponing
to
some
indefinite
period
the
consideration
of
salary
it
is
quite
understood
that
mr
boffin
is
in
no
way
committed
on
that
point
mr
boffin
has
merely
to
add
that
he
relies
on
mr
john
rokesmith
assurance
that
he
will
be
faithful
and
serviceable
mr
john
rokesmith
will
please
enter
on
his
duties
now
noddy
cried
mrs
boffin
clapping
her
hands
is
a
good
one
mr
boffin
was
no
less
delighted
indeed
in
his
own
bosom
he
regarded
both
the
composition
itself
and
the
device
that
had
given
birth
to
it
as
a
very
remarkable
monument
of
human
ingenuity
i
tell
you
my
deary
said
mrs
boffin
if
you
do
close
with
mr
rokesmith
now
at
once
and
if
you
ever
go
a
muddling
yourself
again
with
things
never
meant
nor
made
for
you
you
have
an
apoplexy
besides
your
linen
and
you
break
my
heart
mr
boffin
embraced
his
spouse
for
these
words
of
wisdom
and
then
congratulating
john
rokesmith
on
the
brilliancy
of
his
achievements
gave
him
his
hand
in
pledge
of
their
new
relations
so
did
mrs
boffin
said
mr
boffin
who
in
his
frankness
felt
that
it
did
not
become
him
to
have
a
gentleman
in
his
employment
five
minutes
without
reposing
some
confidence
in
him
must
be
let
a
little
more
into
our
affairs
rokesmith
i
mentioned
to
you
when
i
made
your
acquaintance
or
i
might
better
say
when
you
made
mine
that
mrs
boffin
inclinations
was
setting
in
the
way
of
fashion
but
that
i
did
know
how
fashionable
we
might
or
might
not
grow
well
mrs
boffin
has
carried
the
day
and
we
going
in
neck
and
crop
for
fashion
rather
inferred
that
sir
replied
john
rokesmith
the
scale
on
which
your
new
establishment
is
to
be
maintained
said
mr
boffin
to
be
a
spanker
the
fact
is
my
literary
man
named
to
me
that
a
house
with
which
he
is
as
i
may
say
connected
in
which
he
has
an
interest
property
inquired
john
rokesmith
no
said
mr
boffin
exactly
that
a
sort
of
a
family
tie
the
secretary
suggested
said
mr
boffin
anyhow
he
named
to
me
that
the
house
had
a
board
up
this
eminently
aristocratic
mansion
to
be
let
or
me
and
mrs
boffin
went
to
look
at
it
and
finding
it
beyond
a
doubt
eminently
aristocratic
though
a
trifle
high
and
dull
which
after
all
may
be
part
of
the
same
thing
took
it
my
literary
man
was
so
friendly
as
to
drop
into
a
charming
piece
of
poetry
on
that
occasion
in
which
he
complimented
mrs
boffin
on
coming
into
possession
of
how
did
it
go
my
dear
mrs
boffin
replied
the
gay
the
gay
and
festive
scene
the
halls
the
halls
of
dazzling
it
and
it
was
made
neater
by
there
really
being
two
halls
in
the
house
a
front
and
a
back
besides
the
servants
he
likewise
dropped
into
a
very
pretty
piece
of
poetry
to
be
sure
respecting
the
extent
to
which
he
would
be
willing
to
put
himself
out
of
the
way
to
bring
mrs
boffin
round
in
case
she
should
ever
get
low
in
her
spirits
in
the
house
mrs
boffin
has
a
wonderful
memory
will
you
repeat
it
my
dear
mrs
boffin
complied
by
reciting
the
verses
in
which
this
obliging
offer
had
been
made
exactly
as
she
had
received
them
i
tell
thee
how
the
maiden
wept
mrs
boffin
when
her
true
love
was
slain
and
how
her
broken
spirit
slept
mrs
boffin
and
never
woke
again
i
tell
thee
if
agreeable
to
mr
boffin
how
the
steed
drew
nigh
and
left
his
lord
afar
and
if
my
tale
which
i
hope
mr
boffin
might
excuse
should
make
you
sigh
i
strike
the
light
to
the
letter
said
mr
boffin
i
consider
that
the
poetry
brings
us
both
in
in
a
beautiful
manner
the
effect
of
the
poem
on
the
secretary
being
evidently
to
astonish
him
mr
boffin
was
confirmed
in
his
high
opinion
of
it
and
was
greatly
pleased
you
see
rokesmith
he
went
on
literary
man
with
a
wooden
leg
is
liable
to
jealousy
i
shall
therefore
cast
about
for
comfortable
ways
and
means
of
not
calling
up
wegg
jealousy
but
of
keeping
you
in
your
department
and
keeping
him
in
his
cried
mrs
boffin
i
say
is
the
world
wide
enough
for
all
of
us
it
is
my
dear
said
mr
boffin
not
literary
but
when
so
not
so
and
i
am
bound
to
bear
in
mind
that
i
took
wegg
on
at
a
time
when
i
had
no
thought
of
being
fashionable
or
of
leaving
the
bower
to
let
him
feel
himself
anyways
slighted
now
would
be
to
be
guilty
of
a
meanness
and
to
act
like
having
one
head
turned
by
the
halls
of
dazzling
light
which
lord
forbid
rokesmith
what
shall
we
say
about
your
living
in
the
house
this
house
no
i
have
got
other
plans
for
this
house
in
the
new
house
will
be
as
you
please
mr
boffin
i
hold
myself
quite
at
your
disposal
you
know
where
i
live
at
present
said
mr
boffin
after
considering
the
point
you
keep
as
you
are
for
the
present
and
we
decide
you
begin
to
take
charge
at
once
of
all
that
going
on
in
the
new
house
will
you
willingly
i
will
begin
this
very
day
will
you
give
me
the
address
mr
boffin
repeated
it
and
the
secretary
wrote
it
down
in
his
mrs
boffin
took
the
opportunity
of
his
being
so
engaged
to
get
a
better
observation
of
his
face
than
she
had
yet
taken
it
impressed
her
in
his
favour
for
she
nodded
aside
to
mr
boffin
like
him
will
see
directly
that
everything
is
in
train
mr
boffin
being
here
would
you
care
at
all
to
look
round
the
bower
should
greatly
like
it
i
have
heard
so
much
of
its
story
said
mr
boffin
and
he
and
mrs
boffin
led
the
way
a
gloomy
house
the
bower
with
sordid
signs
on
it
of
having
been
through
its
long
existence
as
harmony
jail
in
miserly
holding
bare
of
paint
bare
of
paper
on
the
walls
bare
of
furniture
bare
of
experience
of
human
life
whatever
is
built
by
man
for
man
occupation
must
like
natural
creations
fulfil
the
intention
of
its
existence
or
soon
perish
this
old
house
had
wasted
more
from
desuetude
than
it
would
have
wasted
from
use
twenty
years
for
one
a
certain
leanness
falls
upon
houses
not
sufficiently
imbued
with
life
as
if
they
were
nourished
upon
it
which
was
very
noticeable
here
the
staircase
balustrades
and
rails
had
a
spare
look
an
air
of
being
denuded
to
the
bone
which
the
panels
of
the
walls
and
the
jambs
of
the
doors
and
windows
also
bore
the
scanty
moveables
partook
of
it
save
for
the
cleanliness
of
the
place
the
dust
into
which
they
were
all
resolving
would
have
lain
thick
on
the
floors
and
those
both
in
colour
and
in
grain
were
worn
like
old
faces
that
had
kept
much
alone
the
bedroom
where
the
clutching
old
man
had
lost
his
grip
on
life
was
left
as
he
had
left
it
there
was
the
old
grisly
bedstead
without
hangings
and
with
a
upper
rim
of
iron
and
spikes
and
there
was
the
old
counterpane
there
was
the
old
bureau
receding
atop
like
a
bad
and
secret
forehead
there
was
the
cumbersome
old
table
with
twisted
legs
at
the
and
there
was
the
box
upon
it
in
which
the
will
had
lain
a
few
old
chairs
with
covers
under
which
the
more
precious
stuff
to
be
preserved
had
slowly
lost
its
quality
of
colour
without
imparting
pleasure
to
any
eye
stood
against
the
wall
a
hard
family
likeness
was
on
all
these
things
room
was
kept
like
this
rokesmith
said
mr
boffin
the
son
return
in
short
everything
in
the
house
was
kept
exactly
as
it
came
to
us
for
him
to
see
and
approve
even
now
nothing
is
changed
but
our
own
room
that
you
have
just
left
when
the
son
came
home
for
the
last
time
in
his
life
and
for
the
last
time
in
his
life
saw
his
father
it
was
most
likely
in
this
room
that
they
met
as
the
secretary
looked
all
round
it
his
eyes
rested
on
a
side
door
in
a
corner
staircase
said
mr
boffin
unlocking
the
door
down
into
the
yard
we
go
down
this
way
as
you
may
like
to
see
the
yard
and
it
all
in
the
road
when
the
son
was
a
little
child
it
was
up
and
down
these
stairs
that
he
mostly
came
and
went
to
his
father
he
was
very
timid
of
his
father
i
seen
him
sit
on
these
stairs
in
his
shy
way
poor
child
many
a
time
mr
and
mrs
boffin
have
comforted
him
sitting
with
his
little
book
on
these
stairs
often
and
his
poor
sister
too
said
mrs
boffin
here
the
sunny
place
on
the
white
wall
where
they
one
day
measured
one
another
their
own
little
hands
wrote
up
their
names
here
only
with
a
pencil
but
the
names
are
here
still
and
the
poor
dears
gone
for
ever
must
take
care
of
the
names
old
lady
said
mr
boffin
must
take
care
of
the
names
they
sha
be
rubbed
out
in
our
time
nor
yet
if
we
can
help
it
in
the
time
after
us
poor
little
children
poor
little
children
said
mrs
boffin
they
had
opened
the
door
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
giving
on
the
yard
and
they
stood
in
the
sunlight
looking
at
the
scrawl
of
the
two
unsteady
childish
hands
two
or
three
steps
up
the
staircase
there
was
something
in
this
simple
memento
of
a
blighted
childhood
and
in
the
tenderness
of
mrs
boffin
that
touched
the
secretary
mr
boffin
then
showed
his
new
man
of
business
the
mounds
and
his
own
particular
mound
which
had
been
left
him
as
his
legacy
under
the
will
before
he
acquired
the
whole
estate
would
have
been
enough
for
us
said
mr
boffin
case
it
had
pleased
god
to
spare
the
last
of
those
two
young
lives
and
sorrowful
deaths
we
did
want
the
rest
at
the
treasures
of
the
yard
and
at
the
outside
of
the
house
and
at
the
detached
building
which
mr
boffin
pointed
out
as
the
residence
of
himself
and
his
wife
during
the
many
years
of
their
service
the
secretary
looked
with
interest
it
was
not
until
mr
boffin
had
shown
him
every
wonder
of
the
bower
twice
over
that
he
remembered
his
having
duties
to
discharge
elsewhere
have
no
instructions
to
give
me
mr
boffin
in
reference
to
this
place
any
rokesmith
no
i
ask
without
seeming
impertinent
whether
you
have
any
intention
of
selling
it
not
in
remembrance
of
our
old
master
our
old
children
and
our
old
service
me
and
mrs
boffin
mean
to
keep
it
up
as
it
stands
the
secretary
eyes
glanced
with
so
much
meaning
in
them
at
the
mounds
that
mr
boffin
said
as
if
in
answer
to
a
remark
ay
that
another
thing
i
may
sell
them
though
i
should
be
sorry
to
see
the
neighbourhood
deprived
of
too
it
look
but
a
poor
dead
flat
without
the
mounds
still
i
do
say
that
i
going
to
keep
always
there
for
the
sake
of
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
there
no
hurry
about
it
that
all
i
say
at
present
i
ai
a
scholar
in
much
rokesmith
but
i
a
pretty
fair
scholar
in
dust
i
can
price
the
mounds
to
a
fraction
and
i
know
how
they
can
be
best
disposed
of
and
likewise
that
they
take
no
harm
by
standing
where
they
do
you
look
in
will
you
be
so
kind
day
and
the
sooner
i
can
get
you
into
your
new
house
complete
the
better
you
will
be
pleased
sir
it
ai
that
i
in
a
mortal
hurry
said
mr
boffin
when
you
do
pay
people
for
looking
alive
it
as
well
to
know
that
they
are
looking
alive
ai
that
your
opinion
replied
the
secretary
and
so
withdrew
said
mr
boffin
to
himself
subsiding
into
his
regular
series
of
turns
in
the
yard
i
can
make
it
comfortable
with
wegg
my
affairs
will
be
going
smooth
the
man
of
low
cunning
had
of
course
acquired
a
mastery
over
the
man
of
high
simplicity
the
mean
man
had
of
course
got
the
better
of
the
generous
man
how
long
such
conquests
last
is
another
matter
that
they
are
achieved
is
experience
not
even
to
be
flourished
away
by
podsnappery
itself
the
undesigning
boffin
had
become
so
far
immeshed
by
the
wily
wegg
that
his
mind
misgave
him
he
was
a
very
designing
man
indeed
in
purposing
to
do
more
for
wegg
it
seemed
to
him
so
skilful
was
wegg
that
he
was
plotting
darkly
when
he
was
contriving
to
do
the
very
thing
that
wegg
was
plotting
to
get
him
to
do
and
thus
while
he
was
mentally
turning
the
kindest
of
kind
faces
on
wegg
this
morning
he
was
not
absolutely
sure
but
that
he
might
somehow
deserve
the
charge
of
turning
his
back
on
him
for
these
reasons
mr
boffin
passed
but
anxious
hours
until
evening
came
and
with
it
mr
wegg
stumping
leisurely
to
the
roman
empire
at
about
this
period
mr
boffin
had
become
profoundly
interested
in
the
fortunes
of
a
great
military
leader
known
to
him
as
bully
sawyers
but
perhaps
better
known
to
fame
and
easier
of
identification
by
the
classical
student
under
the
less
britannic
name
of
belisarius
even
this
general
career
paled
in
interest
for
mr
boffin
before
the
clearing
of
his
conscience
with
wegg
and
hence
when
that
literary
gentleman
had
according
to
custom
eaten
and
drunk
until
he
was
all
and
when
he
took
up
his
book
with
the
usual
chirping
introduction
now
mr
boffin
sir
we
decline
and
we
fall
mr
boffin
stopped
him
remember
wegg
when
i
first
told
you
that
i
wanted
to
make
a
sort
of
offer
to
you
me
get
on
my
considering
cap
sir
replied
that
gentleman
turning
the
open
book
face
downward
you
first
told
me
that
you
wanted
to
make
a
sort
of
offer
to
me
now
let
me
think
as
if
there
were
the
least
necessity
to
be
sure
i
do
mr
boffin
it
was
at
my
corner
to
be
sure
it
was
you
had
first
asked
me
whether
i
liked
your
name
and
candour
had
compelled
a
reply
in
the
negative
case
i
little
thought
then
sir
how
familiar
that
name
would
come
to
be
hope
it
will
be
more
familiar
still
wegg
you
mr
boffin
much
obliged
to
you
i
sure
is
it
your
pleasure
sir
that
we
decline
and
we
fall
with
a
feint
of
taking
up
the
book
just
yet
awhile
wegg
in
fact
i
have
got
another
offer
to
make
you
mr
wegg
who
had
had
nothing
else
in
his
mind
for
several
nights
took
off
his
spectacles
with
an
air
of
bland
surprise
i
hope
you
like
it
wegg
you
sir
returned
that
reticent
individual
hope
it
may
prove
so
on
all
accounts
i
am
sure
this
as
a
philanthropic
aspiration
do
you
think
said
mr
boffin
not
keeping
a
stall
wegg
think
sir
replied
wegg
i
should
like
to
be
shown
the
gentleman
prepared
to
make
it
worth
my
while
he
is
said
mr
boffin
mr
wegg
was
going
to
say
my
benefactor
and
had
said
my
bene
when
a
grandiloquent
change
came
over
him
mr
boffin
not
you
sir
anybody
but
you
do
not
fear
mr
boffin
that
i
shall
contaminate
the
premises
which
your
gold
has
bought
with
my
lowly
pursuits
i
am
aware
sir
that
it
would
not
become
me
to
carry
on
my
little
traffic
under
the
windows
of
your
mansion
i
have
already
thought
of
that
and
taken
my
measures
no
need
to
be
bought
out
sir
would
stepney
fields
be
considered
intrusive
if
not
remote
enough
i
can
go
remoter
in
the
words
of
the
poet
song
which
i
do
not
quite
remember
thrown
on
the
wide
world
doom
to
wander
and
roam
bereft
of
my
parents
bereft
of
a
home
a
stranger
to
something
and
what
his
name
joy
behold
little
edmund
the
poor
peasant
boy
and
equally
said
mr
wegg
repairing
the
want
of
direct
application
in
the
last
line
myself
on
a
similar
footing
wegg
wegg
wegg
remonstrated
the
excellent
boffin
are
too
sensitive
know
i
am
sir
returned
wegg
with
obstinate
magnanimity
am
acquainted
with
my
faults
i
always
was
from
a
child
too
sensitive
listen
pursued
the
golden
dustman
me
out
wegg
you
have
taken
it
into
your
head
that
i
mean
to
pension
you
off
sir
returned
wegg
still
with
an
obstinate
magnanimity
am
acquainted
with
my
faults
far
be
it
from
me
to
deny
them
i
have
taken
it
into
my
head
i
do
mean
it
the
assurance
seemed
hardly
as
comforting
to
mr
wegg
as
mr
boffin
intended
it
to
be
indeed
an
appreciable
elongation
of
his
visage
might
have
been
observed
as
he
replied
you
indeed
sir
pursued
mr
boffin
that
would
express
as
i
understand
it
that
you
were
not
going
to
do
anything
to
deserve
your
money
but
you
are
you
are
sir
replied
mr
wegg
cheering
up
bravely
quite
another
pair
of
shoes
now
my
independence
as
a
man
is
again
elevated
now
i
no
longer
weep
for
the
hour
when
to
boffinses
bower
the
lord
of
the
valley
with
offers
came
neither
does
the
moon
hide
her
light
from
the
heavens
and
weep
behind
her
clouds
any
individual
in
the
present
company
shame
please
to
proceed
mr
boffin
wegg
both
for
your
confidence
in
me
and
for
your
frequent
dropping
into
poetry
both
of
which
is
friendly
well
then
my
idea
is
that
you
should
give
up
your
stall
and
that
i
should
put
you
into
the
bower
here
to
keep
it
for
us
it
a
pleasant
spot
and
a
man
with
coals
and
candles
and
a
pound
a
week
might
be
in
clover
here
would
that
man
sir
we
will
say
that
man
for
the
purposes
of
argueyment
mr
wegg
made
a
smiling
demonstration
of
great
perspicuity
here
that
man
sir
be
expected
to
throw
any
other
capacity
in
or
would
any
other
capacity
be
considered
extra
now
let
us
for
the
purposes
of
argueyment
suppose
that
man
to
be
engaged
as
a
reader
say
for
the
purposes
of
argueyment
in
the
evening
would
that
man
pay
as
a
reader
in
the
evening
be
added
to
the
other
amount
which
adopting
your
language
we
will
call
clover
or
would
it
merge
into
that
amount
or
clover
said
mr
boffin
suppose
it
would
be
added
suppose
it
would
sir
you
are
right
sir
exactly
my
own
views
mr
boffin
here
wegg
rose
and
balancing
himself
on
his
wooden
leg
fluttered
over
his
prey
with
extended
hand
boffin
consider
it
done
say
no
more
sir
not
a
word
more
my
stall
and
i
are
for
ever
parted
the
collection
of
ballads
will
in
future
be
reserved
for
private
study
with
the
object
of
making
poetry
tributary
wegg
was
so
proud
of
having
found
this
word
that
he
said
it
again
with
a
capital
letter
to
friendship
mr
boffin
do
allow
yourself
to
be
made
uncomfortable
by
the
pang
it
gives
me
to
part
from
my
stock
and
stall
similar
emotion
was
undergone
by
my
own
father
when
promoted
for
his
merits
from
his
occupation
as
a
waterman
to
a
situation
under
government
his
christian
name
was
thomas
his
words
at
the
time
i
was
then
an
infant
but
so
deep
was
their
impression
on
me
that
i
committed
them
to
memory
were
then
farewell
my
wherry
oars
and
coat
and
badge
farewell
never
more
at
chelsea
ferry
shall
your
thomas
take
a
spell
my
father
got
over
it
mr
boffin
and
so
shall
i
while
delivering
these
valedictory
observations
wegg
continually
disappointed
mr
boffin
of
his
hand
by
flourishing
it
in
the
air
he
now
darted
it
at
his
patron
who
took
it
and
felt
his
mind
relieved
of
a
great
weight
observing
that
as
they
had
arranged
their
joint
affairs
so
satisfactorily
he
would
now
be
glad
to
look
into
those
of
bully
sawyers
which
indeed
had
been
left
in
a
very
unpromising
posture
and
for
whose
impending
expedition
against
the
persians
the
weather
had
been
by
no
means
favourable
all
day
mr
wegg
resumed
his
spectacles
therefore
but
sawyers
was
not
to
be
of
the
party
that
night
for
before
wegg
had
found
his
place
mrs
tread
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
so
unusually
heavy
and
hurried
that
mr
boffin
would
have
started
up
at
the
sound
anticipating
some
occurrence
much
out
of
the
common
course
even
though
she
had
not
also
called
to
him
in
an
agitated
tone
mr
boffin
hurried
out
and
found
her
on
the
dark
staircase
panting
with
a
lighted
candle
in
her
hand
the
matter
my
dear
do
know
i
do
know
but
i
wish
you
come
much
surprised
mr
boffin
went
up
stairs
and
accompanied
mrs
boffin
into
their
own
room
a
second
large
room
on
the
same
floor
as
the
room
in
which
the
late
proprietor
had
died
mr
boffin
looked
all
round
him
and
saw
nothing
more
unusual
than
various
articles
of
folded
linen
on
a
large
chest
which
mrs
boffin
had
been
sorting
is
it
my
dear
why
you
frightened
you
frightened
am
not
one
of
that
sort
certainly
said
mrs
boffin
as
she
sat
down
in
a
chair
to
recover
herself
and
took
her
husband
arm
very
strange
is
my
dear
the
faces
of
the
old
man
and
the
two
children
are
all
over
the
house
dear
exclaimed
mr
boffin
but
not
without
a
certain
uncomfortable
sensation
gliding
down
his
back
know
it
must
sound
foolish
and
yet
it
is
so
did
you
think
you
saw
them
do
know
that
i
think
i
saw
them
anywhere
i
felt
them
them
felt
them
in
the
air
i
was
sorting
those
things
on
the
chest
and
not
thinking
of
the
old
man
or
the
children
but
singing
to
myself
when
all
in
a
moment
i
felt
there
was
a
face
growing
out
of
the
dark
face
asked
her
husband
looking
about
him
a
moment
it
was
the
old
man
and
then
it
got
younger
for
a
moment
it
was
both
the
children
and
then
it
got
older
for
a
moment
it
was
a
strange
face
and
then
it
was
all
the
faces
then
it
was
gone
and
then
it
was
gone
were
you
then
old
lady
at
the
chest
well
i
got
the
better
of
it
and
went
on
sorting
and
went
on
singing
to
myself
lor
i
says
i
think
of
something
else
something
comfortable
and
put
it
out
of
my
so
i
thought
of
the
new
house
and
miss
bella
wilfer
and
was
thinking
at
a
great
rate
with
that
sheet
there
in
my
hand
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
faces
seemed
to
be
hidden
in
among
the
folds
of
it
and
i
let
it
drop
as
it
still
lay
on
the
floor
where
it
had
fallen
mr
boffin
picked
it
up
and
laid
it
on
the
chest
then
you
ran
down
stairs
i
thought
i
try
another
room
and
shake
it
off
i
says
to
myself
i
go
and
walk
slowly
up
and
down
the
old
man
room
three
times
from
end
to
end
and
then
i
shall
have
conquered
i
went
in
with
the
candle
in
my
hand
but
the
moment
i
came
near
the
bed
the
air
got
thick
with
them
the
faces
and
i
even
felt
that
they
were
in
the
dark
behind
the
and
on
the
little
staircase
floating
away
into
the
yard
then
i
called
you
mr
boffin
lost
in
amazement
looked
at
mrs
boffin
mrs
boffin
lost
in
her
own
fluttered
inability
to
make
this
out
looked
at
mr
boffin
think
my
dear
said
the
golden
dustman
at
once
get
rid
of
wegg
for
the
night
because
he
coming
to
inhabit
the
bower
and
it
might
be
put
into
his
head
or
somebody
else
if
he
heard
this
and
it
got
about
that
the
house
is
haunted
whereas
we
know
better
do
we
never
had
the
feeling
in
the
house
before
said
mrs
boffin
i
have
been
about
it
alone
at
all
hours
of
the
night
i
have
been
in
the
house
when
death
was
in
it
and
i
have
been
in
the
house
when
murder
was
a
new
part
of
its
adventures
and
i
never
had
a
fright
in
it
yet
wo
again
my
dear
said
mr
boffin
upon
it
it
comes
of
thinking
and
dwelling
on
that
dark
spot
but
why
did
it
come
before
asked
mrs
boffin
this
draft
on
mr
boffin
philosophy
could
only
be
met
by
that
gentleman
with
the
remark
that
everything
that
is
at
all
must
begin
at
some
time
then
tucking
his
wife
arm
under
his
own
that
she
might
not
be
left
by
herself
to
be
troubled
again
he
descended
to
release
wegg
who
being
something
drowsy
after
his
plentiful
repast
and
constitutionally
of
a
shirking
temperament
was
well
enough
pleased
to
stump
away
without
doing
what
he
had
come
to
do
and
was
paid
for
doing
mr
boffin
then
put
on
his
hat
and
mrs
boffin
her
shawl
and
the
pair
further
provided
with
a
bunch
of
keys
and
a
lighted
lantern
went
all
over
the
dismal
house
dismal
everywhere
but
in
their
own
two
rooms
from
cellar
to
not
resting
satisfied
with
giving
that
much
chace
to
mrs
boffin
fancies
they
pursued
them
into
the
yard
and
outbuildings
and
under
the
mounds
and
setting
the
lantern
when
all
was
done
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
mounds
they
comfortably
trotted
to
and
fro
for
an
evening
walk
to
the
end
that
the
murky
cobwebs
in
mrs
boffin
brain
might
be
blown
away
my
dear
said
mr
boffin
when
they
came
in
to
supper
was
the
treatment
you
see
completely
worked
round
have
you
deary
said
mrs
boffin
laying
aside
her
shawl
not
nervous
any
more
i
not
a
bit
troubled
now
i
go
anywhere
about
the
house
the
same
as
ever
but
said
mr
boffin
i
only
to
shut
my
eyes
what
then
then
said
mrs
boffin
speaking
with
her
eyes
closed
and
her
left
hand
thoughtfully
touching
her
brow
there
they
are
the
old
man
face
and
it
gets
younger
the
two
children
faces
and
they
get
older
a
face
that
i
do
know
and
then
all
the
faces
opening
her
eyes
again
and
seeing
her
husband
face
across
the
table
she
leaned
forward
to
give
it
a
pat
on
the
cheek
and
sat
down
to
supper
declaring
it
to
be
the
best
face
in
the
world
chapter
minders
and
the
secretary
lost
no
time
in
getting
to
work
and
his
vigilance
and
method
soon
set
their
mark
on
the
golden
dustman
affairs
his
earnestness
in
determining
to
understand
the
length
and
breadth
and
depth
of
every
piece
of
work
submitted
to
him
by
his
employer
was
as
special
as
his
despatch
in
transacting
it
he
accepted
no
information
or
explanation
at
second
hand
but
made
himself
the
master
of
everything
confided
to
him
one
part
of
the
secretary
conduct
underlying
all
the
rest
might
have
been
mistrusted
by
a
man
with
a
better
knowledge
of
men
than
the
golden
dustman
had
the
secretary
was
as
far
from
being
inquisitive
or
intrusive
as
secretary
could
be
but
nothing
less
than
a
complete
understanding
of
the
whole
of
the
affairs
would
content
him
it
soon
became
apparent
from
the
knowledge
with
which
he
set
out
that
he
must
have
been
to
the
office
where
the
harmon
will
was
registered
and
must
have
read
the
will
he
anticipated
mr
boffin
consideration
whether
he
should
be
advised
with
on
this
or
that
topic
by
showing
that
he
already
knew
of
it
and
understood
it
he
did
this
with
no
attempt
at
concealment
seeming
to
be
satisfied
that
it
was
part
of
his
duty
to
have
prepared
himself
at
all
attainable
points
for
its
utmost
discharge
this
might
let
it
be
repeated
have
awakened
some
little
vague
mistrust
in
a
man
more
than
the
golden
dustman
on
the
other
hand
the
secretary
was
discerning
discreet
and
silent
though
as
zealous
as
if
the
affairs
had
been
his
own
he
showed
no
love
of
patronage
or
the
command
of
money
but
distinctly
preferred
resigning
both
to
mr
boffin
if
in
his
limited
sphere
he
sought
power
it
was
the
power
of
knowledge
the
power
derivable
from
a
perfect
comprehension
of
his
business
as
on
the
secretary
face
there
was
a
nameless
cloud
so
on
his
manner
there
was
a
shadow
equally
indefinable
it
was
not
that
he
was
embarrassed
as
on
that
first
night
with
the
wilfer
family
he
was
habitually
unembarrassed
now
and
yet
the
something
remained
it
was
not
that
his
manner
was
bad
as
on
that
occasion
it
was
now
very
good
as
being
modest
gracious
and
ready
yet
the
something
never
left
it
it
has
been
written
of
men
who
have
undergone
a
cruel
captivity
or
who
have
passed
through
a
terrible
strait
or
who
in
have
killed
a
defenceless
that
the
record
thereof
has
never
faded
from
their
countenances
until
they
died
was
there
any
such
record
here
he
established
a
temporary
office
for
himself
in
the
new
house
and
all
went
well
under
his
hand
with
one
singular
exception
he
manifestly
objected
to
communicate
with
mr
boffin
solicitor
two
or
three
times
when
there
was
some
slight
occasion
for
his
doing
so
he
transferred
the
task
to
mr
boffin
and
his
evasion
of
it
soon
became
so
curiously
apparent
that
mr
boffin
spoke
to
him
on
the
subject
of
his
reluctance
is
so
the
secretary
admitted
would
rather
not
had
he
any
personal
objection
to
mr
lightwood
do
know
him
had
he
suffered
from
more
than
other
men
was
his
short
answer
was
he
prejudiced
against
the
race
of
lawyers
but
while
i
am
in
your
employment
sir
i
would
rather
be
excused
from
going
between
the
lawyer
and
the
client
of
course
if
you
press
it
mr
boffin
i
am
ready
to
comply
but
i
should
take
it
as
a
great
favour
if
you
would
not
press
it
without
urgent
occasion
now
it
could
not
be
said
that
there
was
urgent
occasion
for
lightwood
retained
no
other
affairs
in
his
hands
than
such
as
still
lingered
and
languished
about
the
undiscovered
criminal
and
such
as
arose
out
of
the
purchase
of
the
house
many
other
matters
that
might
have
travelled
to
him
now
stopped
short
at
the
secretary
under
whose
administration
they
were
far
more
expeditiously
and
satisfactorily
disposed
of
than
they
would
have
been
if
they
had
got
into
young
blight
domain
this
the
golden
dustman
quite
understood
even
the
matter
immediately
in
hand
was
of
very
little
moment
as
requiring
personal
appearance
on
the
secretary
part
for
it
amounted
to
no
more
than
this
the
death
of
hexam
rendering
the
sweat
of
the
honest
man
brow
unprofitable
the
honest
man
had
shufflingly
declined
to
moisten
his
brow
for
nothing
with
that
severe
exertion
which
is
known
in
legal
circles
as
swearing
your
way
through
a
stone
wall
consequently
that
new
light
had
gone
sputtering
out
but
the
airing
of
the
old
facts
had
led
some
one
concerned
to
suggest
that
it
would
be
well
before
they
were
reconsigned
to
their
gloomy
shelf
now
probably
for
ever
to
induce
or
compel
that
mr
julius
handford
to
reappear
and
be
questioned
and
all
traces
of
mr
julius
handford
being
lost
lightwood
now
referred
to
his
client
for
authority
to
seek
him
through
public
advertisement
your
objection
go
to
writing
to
lightwood
rokesmith
in
the
least
sir
perhaps
you
write
him
a
line
and
say
he
is
free
to
do
what
he
likes
i
do
think
it
promises
do
think
it
promises
said
the
secretary
he
may
do
what
he
likes
will
write
immediately
let
me
thank
you
for
so
considerately
yielding
to
my
disinclination
it
may
seem
less
unreasonable
if
i
avow
to
you
that
although
i
do
know
mr
lightwood
i
have
a
disagreeable
association
connected
with
him
it
is
not
his
fault
he
is
not
at
all
to
blame
for
it
and
does
not
even
know
my
name
mr
boffin
dismissed
the
matter
with
a
nod
or
two
the
letter
was
written
and
next
day
mr
julius
handford
was
advertised
for
he
was
requested
to
place
himself
in
communication
with
mr
mortimer
lightwood
as
a
possible
means
of
furthering
the
ends
of
justice
and
a
reward
was
offered
to
any
one
acquainted
with
his
whereabout
who
would
communicate
the
same
to
the
said
mr
mortimer
lightwood
at
his
office
in
the
temple
every
day
for
six
weeks
this
advertisement
appeared
at
the
head
of
all
the
newspapers
and
every
day
for
six
weeks
the
secretary
when
he
saw
it
said
to
himself
in
the
tone
in
which
he
had
said
to
his
employer
do
think
it
promises
among
his
first
occupations
the
pursuit
of
that
orphan
wanted
by
mrs
boffin
held
a
conspicuous
place
from
the
earliest
moment
of
his
engagement
he
showed
a
particular
desire
to
please
her
and
knowing
her
to
have
this
object
at
heart
he
followed
it
up
with
unwearying
alacrity
and
interest
mr
and
mrs
milvey
had
found
their
search
a
difficult
one
either
an
eligible
orphan
was
of
the
wrong
sex
which
almost
always
happened
or
was
too
old
or
too
young
or
too
sickly
or
too
dirty
or
too
much
accustomed
to
the
streets
or
too
likely
to
run
away
or
it
was
found
impossible
to
complete
the
philanthropic
transaction
without
buying
the
orphan
for
the
instant
it
became
known
that
anybody
wanted
the
orphan
up
started
some
affectionate
relative
of
the
orphan
who
put
a
price
upon
the
orphan
head
the
suddenness
of
an
orphan
rise
in
the
market
was
not
to
be
paralleled
by
the
maddest
records
of
the
stock
exchange
he
would
be
at
five
thousand
per
cent
discount
out
at
nurse
making
a
mud
pie
at
nine
in
the
morning
and
being
inquired
for
would
go
up
to
five
thousand
per
cent
premium
before
noon
the
market
was
in
various
artful
ways
counterfeit
stock
got
into
circulation
parents
boldly
represented
themselves
as
dead
and
brought
their
orphans
with
them
genuine
was
surreptitiously
withdrawn
from
the
market
it
being
announced
by
emissaries
posted
for
the
purpose
that
mr
and
mrs
milvey
were
coming
down
the
court
orphan
scrip
would
be
instantly
concealed
and
production
refused
save
on
a
condition
usually
stated
by
the
brokers
as
gallon
of
beer
likewise
fluctuations
of
a
wild
and
nature
were
occasioned
by
keeping
back
and
then
rushing
into
the
market
a
dozen
together
but
the
uniform
principle
at
the
root
of
all
these
various
operations
was
bargain
and
sale
and
that
principle
could
not
be
recognized
by
mr
and
mrs
milvey
at
length
tidings
were
received
by
the
reverend
frank
of
a
charming
orphan
to
be
found
at
brentford
one
of
the
deceased
parents
late
his
parishioners
had
a
poor
widowed
grandmother
in
that
agreeable
town
and
she
mrs
betty
higden
had
carried
off
the
orphan
with
maternal
care
but
could
not
afford
to
keep
him
the
secretary
proposed
to
mrs
boffin
either
to
go
down
himself
and
take
a
preliminary
survey
of
this
orphan
or
to
drive
her
down
that
she
might
at
once
form
her
own
opinion
mrs
boffin
preferring
the
latter
course
they
set
off
one
morning
in
a
hired
phaeton
conveying
the
young
man
behind
them
the
abode
of
mrs
betty
higden
was
not
easy
to
find
lying
in
such
complicated
back
settlements
of
muddy
brentford
that
they
left
their
equipage
at
the
sign
of
the
three
magpies
and
went
in
search
of
it
on
foot
after
many
inquiries
and
defeats
there
was
pointed
out
to
them
in
a
lane
a
very
small
cottage
residence
with
a
board
across
the
open
doorway
hooked
on
to
which
board
by
the
armpits
was
a
young
gentleman
of
tender
years
angling
for
mud
with
a
headless
wooden
horse
and
line
in
this
young
sportsman
distinguished
by
a
crisply
curling
auburn
head
and
a
bluff
countenance
the
secretary
descried
the
orphan
it
unfortunately
happened
as
they
quickened
their
pace
that
the
orphan
lost
to
considerations
of
personal
safety
in
the
ardour
of
the
moment
overbalanced
himself
and
toppled
into
the
street
being
an
orphan
of
a
chubby
conformation
he
then
took
to
rolling
and
had
rolled
into
the
gutter
before
they
could
come
up
from
the
gutter
he
was
rescued
by
john
rokesmith
and
thus
the
first
meeting
with
mrs
higden
was
inaugurated
by
the
awkward
circumstance
of
their
being
in
possession
one
would
say
at
first
sight
unlawful
possession
of
the
orphan
upside
down
and
purple
in
the
countenance
the
board
across
the
doorway
too
acting
as
a
trap
equally
for
the
feet
of
mrs
higden
coming
out
and
the
feet
of
mrs
boffin
and
john
rokesmith
going
in
greatly
increased
the
difficulty
of
the
situation
to
which
the
cries
of
the
orphan
imparted
a
lugubrious
and
inhuman
character
at
first
it
was
impossible
to
explain
on
account
of
the
his
breath
a
most
terrific
proceeding
in
the
orphan
rigidity
and
a
deadly
silence
compared
with
which
his
cries
were
music
yielding
the
height
of
enjoyment
but
as
he
gradually
recovered
mrs
boffin
gradually
introduced
herself
and
smiling
peace
was
gradually
wooed
back
to
mrs
betty
higden
home
it
was
then
perceived
to
be
a
small
home
with
a
large
mangle
in
it
at
the
handle
of
which
machine
stood
a
very
long
boy
with
a
very
little
head
and
an
open
mouth
of
disproportionate
capacity
that
seemed
to
assist
his
eyes
in
staring
at
the
visitors
in
a
corner
below
the
mangle
on
a
couple
of
stools
sat
two
very
little
children
a
boy
and
a
girl
and
when
the
very
long
boy
in
an
interval
of
staring
took
a
turn
at
the
mangle
it
was
alarming
to
see
how
it
lunged
itself
at
those
two
innocents
like
a
catapult
designed
for
their
destruction
harmlessly
retiring
when
within
an
inch
of
their
heads
the
room
was
clean
and
neat
it
had
a
brick
floor
and
a
window
of
diamond
panes
and
a
flounce
hanging
below
the
and
strings
nailed
from
bottom
to
top
outside
the
window
on
which
were
to
grow
in
the
coming
season
if
the
fates
were
propitious
however
propitious
they
might
have
been
in
the
seasons
that
were
gone
to
betty
higden
in
the
matter
of
beans
they
had
not
been
very
favourable
in
the
matter
of
coins
for
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
was
poor
she
was
one
of
those
old
women
was
mrs
betty
higden
who
by
dint
of
an
indomitable
purpose
and
a
strong
constitution
fight
out
many
years
though
each
year
has
come
with
its
new
blows
fresh
to
the
fight
against
her
wearied
by
it
an
active
old
woman
with
a
bright
dark
eye
and
a
resolute
face
yet
quite
a
tender
creature
too
not
a
woman
but
god
is
good
and
hearts
may
count
in
heaven
as
high
as
heads
sure
said
she
when
the
business
was
opened
milvey
had
the
kindness
to
write
to
me
and
i
got
sloppy
to
read
it
it
was
a
pretty
letter
but
she
an
affable
lady
the
visitors
glanced
at
the
long
boy
who
seemed
to
indicate
by
a
broader
stare
of
his
mouth
and
eyes
that
in
him
sloppy
stood
confessed
i
aint
you
must
know
said
betty
of
a
hand
at
reading
though
i
can
read
my
bible
and
most
print
and
i
do
love
a
newspaper
you
might
think
it
but
sloppy
is
a
beautiful
reader
of
a
newspaper
he
do
the
police
in
different
voices
the
visitors
again
considered
it
a
point
of
politeness
to
look
at
sloppy
who
looking
at
them
suddenly
threw
back
his
head
extended
his
mouth
to
its
utmost
width
and
laughed
loud
and
long
at
this
the
two
innocents
with
their
brains
in
that
apparent
danger
laughed
and
mrs
higden
laughed
and
the
orphan
laughed
and
then
the
visitors
laughed
which
was
more
cheerful
than
intelligible
then
sloppy
seeming
to
be
seized
with
an
industrious
mania
or
fury
turned
to
at
the
mangle
and
impelled
it
at
the
heads
of
the
innocents
with
such
a
creaking
and
rumbling
that
mrs
higden
stopped
him
gentlefolks
ca
hear
themselves
speak
sloppy
bide
a
bit
bide
a
bit
that
the
dear
child
in
your
lap
said
mrs
boffin
this
is
johnny
too
cried
mrs
boffin
turning
to
the
secretary
johnny
only
one
of
the
two
names
left
to
give
him
he
a
pretty
boy
with
his
chin
tucked
down
in
his
shy
childish
manner
he
was
looking
furtively
at
mrs
boffin
out
of
his
blue
eyes
and
reaching
his
fat
dimpled
hand
up
to
the
lips
of
the
old
woman
who
was
kissing
it
by
times
he
a
pretty
boy
he
a
dear
darling
boy
he
the
child
of
my
own
last
left
daughter
daughter
but
she
gone
the
way
of
all
the
rest
are
not
his
brother
and
sister
said
mrs
boffin
dear
no
those
are
minders
the
secretary
repeated
to
be
minded
sir
i
keep
a
i
can
take
only
three
on
account
of
the
mangle
but
i
love
children
and
a
week
is
come
here
toddles
and
poddles
toddles
was
the
of
the
boy
poddles
of
the
girl
at
their
little
unsteady
pace
they
came
across
the
floor
as
if
they
were
traversing
an
extremely
difficult
road
intersected
by
brooks
and
when
they
had
had
their
heads
patted
by
mrs
betty
higden
made
lunges
at
the
orphan
dramatically
representing
an
attempt
to
bear
him
crowing
into
captivity
and
slavery
all
the
three
children
enjoyed
this
to
a
delightful
extent
and
the
sympathetic
sloppy
again
laughed
long
and
loud
when
it
was
discreet
to
stop
the
play
betty
higden
said
to
your
seats
toddles
and
poddles
and
they
returned
across
country
seeming
to
find
the
brooks
rather
swollen
by
late
rains
master
or
mister
sloppy
said
the
secretary
in
doubt
whether
he
was
man
boy
or
what
returned
betty
higden
dropping
her
voice
never
known
found
in
the
street
he
was
brought
up
in
the
with
a
shiver
of
repugnance
the
house
said
the
secretary
mrs
higden
set
that
resolute
old
face
of
hers
and
darkly
nodded
yes
dislike
the
mention
of
it
the
mention
of
it
answered
the
old
woman
me
sooner
than
take
me
there
throw
this
pretty
child
under
feet
and
a
loaded
waggon
sooner
than
take
him
there
come
to
us
and
find
us
all
and
set
a
light
to
us
all
where
we
lie
and
let
us
all
blaze
away
with
the
house
into
a
heap
of
cinders
sooner
than
move
a
corpse
of
us
there
a
surprising
spirit
in
this
lonely
woman
after
so
many
years
of
hard
working
and
hard
living
my
lords
and
gentlemen
and
honourable
boards
what
is
it
that
we
call
it
in
our
grandiose
speeches
british
independence
rather
perverted
is
that
or
something
like
it
the
ring
of
the
cant
i
never
read
in
the
newspapers
said
the
dame
fondling
the
child
help
me
and
the
like
of
me
how
the
people
that
do
come
down
to
that
get
driven
from
post
to
pillar
and
pillar
to
post
to
tire
them
out
do
i
never
read
how
they
are
put
off
put
off
put
off
how
they
are
grudged
grudged
grudged
the
shelter
or
the
doctor
or
the
drop
of
physic
or
the
bit
of
bread
do
i
never
read
how
they
grow
heartsick
of
it
and
give
it
up
after
having
let
themselves
drop
so
low
and
how
they
after
all
die
out
for
want
of
help
then
i
say
i
hope
i
can
die
as
well
as
another
and
i
die
without
that
disgrace
absolutely
impossible
my
lords
and
gentlemen
and
honourable
boards
by
any
stretch
of
legislative
wisdom
to
set
these
perverse
people
right
in
their
logic
my
pretty
continued
old
betty
caressing
the
child
and
rather
mourning
over
it
than
speaking
to
it
old
granny
betty
is
nigher
fourscore
year
than
threescore
and
ten
she
never
begged
nor
had
a
penny
of
the
union
money
in
all
her
life
she
paid
scot
and
she
paid
lot
when
she
had
money
to
pay
she
worked
when
she
could
and
she
starved
when
she
must
you
pray
that
your
granny
may
have
strength
enough
left
her
at
the
last
she
strong
for
an
old
one
johnny
to
get
up
from
her
bed
and
run
and
hide
herself
and
swown
to
death
in
a
hole
sooner
than
fall
into
the
hands
of
those
cruel
jacks
we
read
of
that
dodge
and
drive
and
worry
and
weary
and
scorn
and
shame
the
decent
poor
a
brilliant
success
my
lords
and
gentlemen
and
honourable
boards
to
have
brought
it
to
this
in
the
minds
of
the
best
of
the
poor
under
submission
might
it
be
worth
thinking
of
at
any
odd
time
the
fright
and
abhorrence
that
mrs
betty
higden
smoothed
out
of
her
strong
face
as
she
ended
this
diversion
showed
how
seriously
she
had
meant
it
does
he
work
for
you
asked
the
secretary
gently
bringing
the
discourse
back
to
master
or
mister
sloppy
said
betty
with
a
smile
and
nod
of
the
head
well
too
he
live
here
lives
more
here
than
anywhere
he
was
thought
to
be
no
better
than
a
natural
and
first
come
to
me
as
a
minder
i
made
interest
with
mr
blogg
the
beadle
to
have
him
as
a
minder
seeing
him
by
chance
up
at
church
and
thinking
i
might
do
something
with
him
for
he
was
a
weak
ricketty
creetur
then
he
called
by
his
right
name
you
see
speaking
quite
correctly
he
has
no
right
name
i
always
understood
he
took
his
name
from
being
found
on
a
sloppy
night
seems
an
amiable
fellow
you
sir
there
not
a
bit
of
him
returned
betty
not
amiable
so
you
may
judge
how
amiable
he
is
by
running
your
eye
along
his
heighth
of
an
ungainly
make
was
sloppy
too
much
of
him
longwise
too
little
of
him
broadwise
and
too
many
sharp
angles
of
him
one
of
those
shambling
male
human
creatures
born
to
be
indiscreetly
candid
in
the
revelation
of
buttons
every
button
he
had
about
him
glaring
at
the
public
to
a
quite
preternatural
extent
a
considerable
capital
of
knee
and
elbow
and
wrist
and
ankle
had
sloppy
and
he
did
know
how
to
dispose
of
it
to
the
best
advantage
but
was
always
investing
it
in
wrong
securities
and
so
getting
himself
into
embarrassed
circumstances
number
one
in
the
awkward
squad
of
the
rank
and
file
of
life
was
sloppy
and
yet
had
his
glimmering
notions
of
standing
true
to
the
colours
now
said
mrs
boffin
johnny
as
johnny
with
his
chin
tucked
in
and
lips
pouting
reclined
in
lap
concentrating
his
blue
eyes
on
the
visitors
and
shading
them
from
observation
with
a
dimpled
arm
old
betty
took
one
of
his
fresh
fat
hands
in
her
withered
right
and
fell
to
gently
beating
it
on
her
withered
left
concerning
johnny
you
trust
the
dear
child
to
me
said
mrs
boffin
with
a
face
inviting
trust
shall
have
the
best
of
homes
the
best
of
care
the
best
of
education
the
best
of
friends
please
god
i
will
be
a
true
good
mother
to
him
am
thankful
to
you
and
the
dear
child
would
be
thankful
if
he
was
old
enough
to
understand
still
lightly
beating
the
little
hand
upon
her
own
would
stand
in
the
dear
child
light
not
if
i
had
all
my
life
before
me
instead
of
a
very
little
of
it
but
i
hope
you
wo
take
it
ill
that
i
cleave
to
the
child
closer
than
words
can
tell
for
he
the
last
living
thing
left
me
it
ill
my
dear
soul
is
it
likely
and
you
so
tender
of
him
as
to
bring
him
home
here
have
seen
said
betty
still
with
that
light
beat
upon
her
hard
rough
hand
many
of
them
on
my
lap
and
they
are
all
gone
but
this
one
i
am
ashamed
to
seem
so
selfish
but
i
do
really
mean
it
be
the
making
of
his
fortune
and
he
be
a
gentleman
when
i
am
dead
i
i
do
know
what
comes
over
me
i
try
against
it
do
notice
me
the
light
beat
stopped
the
resolute
mouth
gave
way
and
the
fine
strong
old
face
broke
up
into
weakness
and
tears
now
greatly
to
the
relief
of
the
visitors
the
emotional
sloppy
no
sooner
beheld
his
patroness
in
this
condition
than
throwing
back
his
head
and
throwing
open
his
mouth
he
lifted
up
his
voice
and
bellowed
this
alarming
note
of
something
wrong
instantly
terrified
toddles
and
poddles
who
were
no
sooner
heard
to
roar
surprisingly
than
johnny
curving
himself
the
wrong
way
and
striking
out
at
mrs
boffin
with
a
pair
of
indifferent
shoes
became
a
prey
to
despair
the
absurdity
of
the
situation
put
its
pathos
to
the
rout
mrs
betty
higden
was
herself
in
a
moment
and
brought
them
all
to
order
with
that
speed
that
sloppy
stopping
short
in
a
polysyllabic
bellow
transferred
his
energy
to
the
mangle
and
had
taken
several
penitential
turns
before
he
could
be
stopped
there
there
said
mrs
boffin
almost
regarding
her
kind
self
as
the
most
ruthless
of
women
is
going
to
be
done
nobody
need
be
frightened
we
all
comfortable
ai
we
mrs
higden
and
certain
we
are
returned
betty
there
really
is
no
hurry
you
know
said
mrs
boffin
in
a
lower
voice
time
to
think
of
it
my
good
creature
you
fear
me
no
more
said
betty
thought
of
it
for
good
yesterday
i
do
know
what
come
over
me
just
now
but
it
never
come
again
then
johnny
shall
have
more
time
to
think
of
it
returned
mrs
boffin
pretty
child
shall
have
time
to
get
used
to
it
and
get
him
more
used
to
it
if
you
think
well
of
it
wo
you
betty
undertook
that
cheerfully
and
readily
cried
mrs
boffin
looking
radiantly
about
her
want
to
make
everybody
happy
not
dismal
and
perhaps
you
would
mind
letting
me
know
how
used
to
it
you
begin
to
get
and
how
it
all
goes
on
send
sloppy
said
mrs
higden
this
gentleman
who
has
come
with
me
will
pay
him
for
his
trouble
said
mrs
boffin
mr
sloppy
whenever
you
come
to
my
house
be
sure
you
never
go
away
without
having
had
a
good
dinner
of
meat
beer
vegetables
and
pudding
this
still
further
brightened
the
face
of
affairs
for
the
highly
sympathetic
sloppy
first
broadly
staring
and
grinning
and
then
roaring
with
laughter
toddles
and
poddles
followed
suit
and
johnny
trumped
the
trick
t
and
p
considering
these
favourable
circumstances
for
the
resumption
of
that
dramatic
descent
upon
johnny
again
came
upon
a
buccaneering
expedition
and
this
having
been
fought
out
in
the
chimney
corner
behind
mrs
higden
chair
with
great
valour
on
both
sides
those
desperate
pirates
returned
to
their
stools
across
the
dry
bed
of
a
mountain
torrent
must
tell
me
what
i
can
do
for
you
betty
my
friend
said
mrs
boffin
confidentially
not
next
time
you
all
the
same
but
i
want
nothing
for
myself
i
can
work
i
strong
i
can
walk
twenty
mile
if
i
put
to
it
old
betty
was
proud
and
said
it
with
a
sparkle
in
her
bright
eyes
but
there
are
some
little
comforts
that
you
would
be
the
worse
for
returned
mrs
boffin
ye
i
was
born
a
lady
any
more
than
you
seems
to
me
said
betty
smiling
you
were
born
a
lady
and
a
true
one
or
there
never
was
a
lady
born
but
i
could
take
anything
from
you
my
dear
i
never
did
take
anything
from
any
one
it
ai
that
i
not
grateful
but
i
love
to
earn
it
better
well
returned
mrs
boffin
only
spoke
of
little
things
or
i
would
have
taken
the
liberty
betty
put
her
visitor
hand
to
her
lips
in
acknowledgment
of
the
delicate
answer
wonderfully
upright
her
figure
was
and
wonderfully
her
look
as
standing
facing
her
visitor
she
explained
herself
further
i
could
have
kept
the
dear
child
without
the
dread
that
always
upon
me
of
his
coming
to
that
fate
i
have
spoken
of
i
could
never
have
parted
with
him
even
to
you
for
i
love
him
i
love
him
i
love
him
i
love
my
husband
long
dead
and
gone
in
him
i
love
my
children
dead
and
gone
in
him
i
love
my
young
and
hopeful
days
dead
and
gone
in
him
i
could
sell
that
love
and
look
you
in
your
bright
kind
face
it
a
free
gift
i
am
in
want
of
nothing
when
my
strength
fails
me
if
i
can
but
die
out
quick
and
quiet
i
shall
be
quite
content
i
have
stood
between
my
dead
and
that
shame
i
have
spoken
of
and
it
has
been
kept
off
from
every
one
of
them
sewed
into
my
gown
with
her
hand
upon
her
breast
just
enough
to
lay
me
in
the
grave
only
see
that
rightly
spent
so
as
i
may
rest
free
to
the
last
from
that
cruelty
and
disgrace
and
you
have
done
much
more
than
a
little
thing
for
me
and
all
that
in
this
present
world
my
heart
is
set
upon
mrs
betty
higden
visitor
pressed
her
hand
there
was
no
more
breaking
up
of
the
strong
old
face
into
weakness
my
lords
and
gentlemen
and
honourable
boards
it
really
was
as
composed
as
our
own
faces
and
almost
as
dignified
and
now
johnny
was
to
be
inveigled
into
occupying
a
temporary
position
on
mrs
boffin
lap
it
was
not
until
he
had
been
piqued
into
competition
with
the
two
diminutive
minders
by
seeing
them
successively
raised
to
that
post
and
retire
from
it
without
injury
that
he
could
be
by
any
means
induced
to
leave
mrs
betty
higden
skirts
towards
which
he
exhibited
even
when
in
mrs
boffin
embrace
strong
yearnings
spiritual
and
bodily
the
former
expressed
in
a
very
gloomy
visage
the
latter
in
extended
arms
however
a
general
description
of
the
lurking
in
mr
boffin
house
so
far
conciliated
this
orphan
as
to
induce
him
to
stare
at
her
frowningly
with
a
fist
in
his
mouth
and
even
at
length
to
chuckle
when
a
horse
on
wheels
with
a
miraculous
gift
of
cantering
to
was
mentioned
this
sound
being
taken
up
by
the
minders
swelled
into
a
rapturous
trio
which
gave
general
satisfaction
so
the
interview
was
considered
very
successful
and
mrs
boffin
was
pleased
and
all
were
satisfied
not
least
of
all
sloppy
who
undertook
to
conduct
the
visitors
back
by
the
best
way
to
the
three
magpies
and
whom
the
young
man
much
despised
this
piece
of
business
thus
put
in
train
the
secretary
drove
mrs
boffin
back
to
the
bower
and
found
employment
for
himself
at
the
new
house
until
evening
whether
when
evening
came
he
took
a
way
to
his
lodgings
that
led
through
fields
with
any
design
of
finding
miss
bella
wilfer
in
those
fields
is
not
so
certain
as
that
she
regularly
walked
there
at
that
hour
and
moreover
it
is
certain
that
there
she
was
no
longer
in
mourning
miss
bella
was
dressed
in
as
pretty
colours
as
she
could
muster
there
is
no
denying
that
she
was
as
pretty
as
they
and
that
she
and
the
colours
went
very
prettily
together
she
was
reading
as
she
walked
and
of
course
it
is
to
be
inferred
from
her
showing
no
knowledge
of
mr
rokesmith
approach
that
she
did
not
know
he
was
approaching
said
miss
bella
raising
her
eyes
from
her
book
when
he
stopped
before
her
it
you
i
a
fine
evening
it
said
bella
looking
coldly
round
suppose
it
is
now
you
mention
it
i
have
not
been
thinking
of
the
evening
intent
upon
your
book
replied
bella
with
a
drawl
of
indifference
love
story
miss
wilfer
dear
no
or
i
should
be
reading
it
it
more
about
money
than
anything
else
does
it
say
that
money
is
better
than
anything
my
word
returned
bella
forget
what
it
says
but
you
can
find
out
for
yourself
if
you
like
mr
rokesmith
i
do
want
it
any
more
the
secretary
took
the
book
she
had
fluttered
the
leaves
as
if
it
were
a
fan
and
walked
beside
her
am
charged
with
a
message
for
you
miss
wilfer
i
think
said
bella
with
another
drawl
mrs
boffin
she
desired
me
to
assure
you
of
the
pleasure
she
has
in
finding
that
she
will
be
ready
to
receive
you
in
another
week
or
two
at
furthest
bella
turned
her
head
towards
him
with
her
eyebrows
raised
and
her
eyelids
drooping
as
much
as
to
say
did
you
come
by
the
message
pray
have
been
waiting
for
an
opportunity
of
telling
you
that
i
am
mr
boffin
secretary
am
as
wise
as
ever
said
miss
bella
loftily
i
do
know
what
a
secretary
is
not
that
it
signifies
at
all
a
covert
glance
at
her
face
as
he
walked
beside
her
showed
him
that
she
had
not
expected
his
ready
assent
to
that
proposition
are
you
going
to
be
always
there
mr
rokesmith
she
inquired
as
if
that
would
be
a
drawback
no
very
much
there
yes
me
drawled
bella
in
a
tone
of
mortification
my
position
there
as
secretary
will
be
very
different
from
yours
as
guest
you
will
know
little
or
nothing
about
me
i
shall
transact
the
business
you
will
transact
the
pleasure
i
shall
have
my
salary
to
earn
you
will
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
enjoy
and
attract
sir
said
bella
again
with
her
eyebrows
raised
and
her
eyelids
drooping
do
understand
you
without
replying
on
this
point
mr
rokesmith
went
on
me
when
i
first
saw
you
in
your
black
dress
was
miss
bella
mental
exclamation
did
i
say
to
them
at
home
everybody
noticed
that
ridiculous
mourning
i
first
saw
you
in
your
black
dress
i
was
at
a
loss
to
account
for
that
distinction
between
yourself
and
your
family
i
hope
it
was
not
impertinent
to
speculate
upon
it
hope
not
i
am
sure
said
miss
bella
haughtily
you
ought
to
know
best
how
you
speculated
upon
it
mr
rokesmith
inclined
his
head
in
a
deprecatory
manner
and
went
on
i
have
been
entrusted
with
mr
boffin
affairs
i
have
necessarily
come
to
understand
the
little
mystery
i
venture
to
remark
that
i
feel
persuaded
that
much
of
your
loss
may
be
repaired
i
speak
of
course
merely
of
wealth
miss
wilfer
the
loss
of
a
perfect
stranger
whose
worth
or
worthlessness
i
can
not
estimate
nor
you
either
is
beside
the
question
but
this
excellent
gentleman
and
lady
are
so
full
of
simplicity
so
full
of
generosity
so
inclined
towards
you
and
so
desirous
to
how
shall
i
express
it
to
make
amends
for
their
good
fortune
that
you
have
only
to
respond
as
he
watched
her
with
another
covert
look
he
saw
a
certain
ambitious
triumph
in
her
face
which
no
assumed
coldness
could
conceal
we
have
been
brought
under
one
roof
by
an
accidental
combination
of
circumstances
which
oddly
extends
itself
to
the
new
relations
before
us
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
saying
these
few
words
you
consider
them
intrusive
i
hope
said
the
secretary
with
deference
mr
rokesmith
i
ca
say
what
i
consider
them
returned
the
young
lady
are
perfectly
new
to
me
and
may
be
founded
altogether
on
your
own
imagination
will
see
these
same
fields
were
opposite
the
wilfer
premises
the
discreet
mrs
wilfer
now
looking
out
of
window
and
beholding
her
daughter
in
conference
with
her
lodger
instantly
tied
up
her
head
and
came
out
for
a
casual
walk
have
been
telling
miss
wilfer
said
john
rokesmith
as
the
majestic
lady
came
stalking
up
i
have
become
by
a
curious
chance
mr
boffin
secretary
or
man
of
business
have
not
returned
mrs
wilfer
waving
her
gloves
in
her
chronic
state
of
dignity
and
vague
honour
of
any
intimate
acquaintance
with
mr
boffin
and
it
is
not
for
me
to
congratulate
that
gentleman
on
the
acquisition
he
has
made
poor
one
enough
said
rokesmith
me
returned
mrs
wilfer
merits
of
mr
boffin
may
be
highly
distinguished
may
be
more
distinguished
than
the
countenance
of
mrs
boffin
would
imply
but
it
were
the
insanity
of
humility
to
deem
him
worthy
of
a
better
assistant
are
very
good
i
have
also
been
telling
miss
wilfer
that
she
is
expected
very
shortly
at
the
new
residence
in
town
tacitly
consented
said
mrs
wilfer
with
a
grand
shrug
of
her
shoulders
and
another
wave
of
her
gloves
my
child
acceptance
of
the
proffered
attentions
of
mrs
boffin
i
interpose
no
objection
here
miss
bella
offered
the
remonstrance
talk
nonsense
ma
please
said
mrs
wilfer
ma
i
am
not
going
to
be
made
so
absurd
interposing
objections
say
repeated
mrs
wilfer
with
a
vast
access
of
grandeur
i
am
not
going
to
interpose
objections
if
mrs
boffin
to
whose
countenance
no
disciple
of
lavater
could
possibly
for
a
single
moment
subscribe
with
a
shiver
to
illuminate
her
new
residence
in
town
with
the
attractions
of
a
child
of
mine
i
am
content
that
she
should
be
favoured
by
the
company
of
a
child
of
mine
use
the
word
i
have
myself
used
said
rokesmith
with
a
glance
at
bella
you
speak
of
miss
wilfer
attractions
there
me
returned
mrs
wilfer
with
dreadful
solemnity
i
had
not
finished
excuse
me
was
about
to
say
pursued
mrs
wilfer
who
clearly
had
not
had
the
faintest
idea
of
saying
anything
more
when
i
use
the
term
attractions
i
do
so
with
the
qualification
that
i
do
not
mean
it
in
any
way
whatever
the
excellent
lady
delivered
this
luminous
elucidation
of
her
views
with
an
air
of
greatly
obliging
her
hearers
and
greatly
distinguishing
herself
whereat
miss
bella
laughed
a
scornful
little
laugh
and
said
enough
about
this
i
am
sure
on
all
sides
have
the
goodness
mr
rokesmith
to
give
my
love
to
mrs
boffin
me
cried
mrs
wilfer
repeated
bella
with
a
little
stamp
of
her
foot
said
mrs
wilfer
monotonously
miss
wilfer
love
and
mrs
wilfer
compliments
the
secretary
proposed
as
a
compromise
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
come
when
she
is
ready
for
me
the
sooner
the
better
last
word
bella
said
mrs
wilfer
descending
to
the
family
apartment
i
trust
that
as
a
child
of
mine
you
will
ever
be
sensible
that
it
will
be
graceful
in
you
when
associating
with
mr
and
mrs
boffin
upon
equal
terms
to
remember
that
the
secretary
mr
rokesmith
as
your
father
lodger
has
a
claim
on
your
good
word
the
condescension
with
which
mrs
wilfer
delivered
this
proclamation
of
patronage
was
as
wonderful
as
the
swiftness
with
which
the
lodger
had
lost
caste
in
the
secretary
he
smiled
as
the
mother
retired
down
stairs
but
his
face
fell
as
the
daughter
followed
insolent
so
trivial
so
capricious
so
mercenary
so
careless
so
hard
to
touch
so
hard
to
turn
he
said
bitterly
and
added
as
he
went
upstairs
yet
so
pretty
so
pretty
and
added
presently
as
he
walked
to
and
fro
in
his
room
if
she
knew
she
knew
that
he
was
shaking
the
house
by
his
walking
to
and
fro
and
she
declared
it
another
of
the
miseries
of
being
poor

you

rid

a
pale
individuality
of
an
address
to
nicodemus
boffin
esquire
in
quite
another
hand
it
takes
two
noble
earls
and
a
viscount
combined
to
inform
nicodemus
boffin
esquire
in
an
equally
flattering
manner
that
an
estimable
lady
in
the
west
of
england
has
offered
to
present
a
purse
containing
twenty
pounds
to
the
society
for
granting
annuities
to
unassuming
members
of
the
middle
classes
if
twenty
individuals
will
previously
present
purses
of
one
hundred
pounds
each
and
those
benevolent
noblemen
very
kindly
point
out
that
if
nicodemus
boffin
esquire
should
wish
to
present
two
or
more
purses
it
will
not
be
inconsistent
with
the
design
of
the
estimable
lady
in
the
west
of
england
provided
each
purse
be
coupled
with
the
name
of
some
member
of
his
honoured
and
respected
family
these
are
the
corporate
beggars
but
there
are
besides
the
individual
beggars
and
how
does
the
heart
of
the
secretary
fail
him
when
he
has
to
cope
with
them
and
they
must
be
coped
with
to
some
extent
because
they
all
enclose
documents
they
call
their
scraps
documents
but
they
are
as
to
papers
deserving
the
name
what
minced
veal
is
to
a
calf
the
of
which
would
be
their
ruin
that
is
say
they
are
utterly
ruined
now
but
they
would
be
more
utterly
ruined
then
among
these
correspondents
are
several
daughters
of
general
officers
long
accustomed
to
every
luxury
of
life
except
spelling
who
little
thought
when
their
gallant
fathers
waged
war
in
the
peninsula
that
they
would
ever
have
to
appeal
to
those
whom
providence
in
its
inscrutable
wisdom
has
blessed
with
untold
gold
and
from
among
whom
they
select
the
name
of
nicodemus
boffin
esquire
for
a
maiden
effort
in
this
wise
understanding
that
he
has
such
a
heart
as
never
was
the
secretary
learns
too
that
confidence
between
man
and
wife
would
seem
to
obtain
but
rarely
when
virtue
is
in
distress
so
numerous
are
the
wives
who
take
up
their
pens
to
ask
mr
boffin
for
money
without
the
knowledge
of
their
devoted
husbands
who
would
never
permit
it
while
on
the
other
hand
so
numerous
are
the
husbands
who
take
up
their
pens
to
ask
mr
boffin
for
money
without
the
knowledge
of
their
devoted
wives
who
would
instantly
go
out
of
their
senses
if
they
had
the
least
suspicion
of
the
circumstance
there
are
the
inspired
beggars
too
these
were
sitting
only
yesterday
evening
musing
over
a
fragment
of
candle
which
must
soon
go
out
and
leave
them
in
the
dark
for
the
rest
of
their
nights
when
surely
some
angel
whispered
the
name
of
nicodemus
boffin
esquire
to
their
souls
imparting
rays
of
hope
nay
confidence
to
which
they
had
long
been
strangers
akin
to
these
are
the
beggars
they
were
partaking
of
a
cold
potato
and
water
by
the
flickering
and
gloomy
light
of
a
in
their
lodgings
rent
considerably
in
arrear
and
heartless
landlady
threatening
expulsion
a
dog
into
the
streets
when
a
gifted
friend
happening
to
look
in
said
immediately
to
nicodemus
boffin
esquire
and
would
take
no
denial
there
are
the
nobly
independent
beggars
too
these
in
the
days
of
their
abundance
ever
regarded
gold
as
dross
and
have
not
yet
got
over
that
only
impediment
in
the
way
of
their
amassing
wealth
but
they
want
no
dross
from
nicodemus
boffin
esquire
no
mr
boffin
the
world
may
term
it
pride
paltry
pride
if
you
will
but
they
would
take
it
if
you
offered
it
a
loan
sir
for
fourteen
weeks
to
the
day
interest
calculated
at
the
rate
of
five
per
cent
per
annum
to
be
bestowed
upon
any
charitable
institution
you
may
name
is
all
they
want
of
you
and
if
you
have
the
meanness
to
refuse
it
count
on
being
despised
by
these
great
spirits
there
are
the
beggars
of
punctual
too
these
will
make
an
end
of
themselves
at
a
quarter
to
one
on
tuesday
if
no
order
is
in
the
interim
received
from
nicodemus
boffin
esquire
arriving
after
a
quarter
to
one
on
tuesday
it
need
not
be
sent
as
they
will
then
having
made
an
exact
memorandum
of
the
heartless
circumstances
be
in
death
there
are
the
beggars
on
horseback
too
in
another
sense
from
the
sense
of
the
proverb
these
are
mounted
and
ready
to
start
on
the
highway
to
affluence
the
goal
is
before
them
the
road
is
in
the
best
condition
their
spurs
are
on
the
steed
is
willing
but
at
the
last
moment
for
want
of
some
special
thing
a
clock
a
violin
an
astronomical
telescope
an
electrifying
machine
they
must
dismount
for
ever
unless
they
receive
its
equivalent
in
money
from
nicodemus
boffin
esquire
less
given
to
detail
are
the
beggars
who
make
sporting
ventures
these
usually
to
be
addressed
in
reply
under
initials
at
a
country
inquire
in
feminine
hands
dare
one
who
can
not
disclose
herself
to
nicodemus
boffin
esquire
but
whose
name
might
startle
him
were
it
revealed
solicit
the
immediate
advance
of
two
hundred
pounds
from
unexpected
riches
exercising
their
noblest
privilege
in
the
trust
of
a
common
humanity
in
such
a
dismal
swamp
does
the
new
house
stand
and
through
it
does
the
secretary
daily
struggle
not
to
mention
all
the
people
alive
who
have
made
inventions
that
wo
act
and
all
the
jobbers
who
job
in
all
the
jobberies
jobbed
though
these
may
be
regarded
as
the
alligators
of
the
dismal
swamp
and
are
always
lying
by
to
drag
the
golden
dustman
under
but
the
old
house
there
are
no
designs
against
the
golden
dustman
there
there
are
no
fish
of
the
shark
tribe
in
the
bower
waters
perhaps
not
still
wegg
is
established
there
and
would
seem
judged
by
his
secret
proceedings
to
cherish
a
notion
of
making
a
discovery
for
when
a
man
with
a
wooden
leg
lies
prone
on
his
stomach
to
peep
under
bedsteads
and
hops
up
ladders
like
some
extinct
bird
to
survey
the
tops
of
presses
and
cupboards
and
provides
himself
an
iron
rod
which
he
is
always
poking
and
prodding
into
the
probability
is
that
he
expects
to
find
something
book
the
second
birds
of
a
feather
chapter
of
an
educational
character
the
school
at
which
young
charley
hexam
had
first
learned
from
a
book
the
streets
being
for
pupils
of
his
degree
the
great
preparatory
establishment
in
which
very
much
that
is
never
unlearned
is
learned
without
and
before
book
was
a
miserable
loft
in
an
unsavoury
yard
its
atmosphere
was
oppressive
and
disagreeable
it
was
crowded
noisy
and
confusing
half
the
pupils
dropped
asleep
or
fell
into
a
state
of
waking
stupefaction
the
other
half
kept
them
in
either
condition
by
maintaining
a
monotonous
droning
noise
as
if
they
were
performing
out
of
time
and
tune
on
a
ruder
sort
of
bagpipe
the
teachers
animated
solely
by
good
intentions
had
no
idea
of
execution
and
a
lamentable
jumble
was
the
upshot
of
their
kind
endeavours
it
was
a
school
for
all
ages
and
for
both
sexes
the
latter
were
kept
apart
and
the
former
were
partitioned
off
into
square
assortments
but
all
the
place
was
pervaded
by
a
grimly
ludicrous
pretence
that
every
pupil
was
childish
and
innocent
this
pretence
much
favoured
by
the
led
to
the
ghastliest
absurdities
young
women
old
in
the
vices
of
the
commonest
and
worst
life
were
expected
to
profess
themselves
enthralled
by
the
good
child
book
the
adventures
of
little
margery
who
resided
in
the
village
cottage
by
the
mill
severely
reproved
and
morally
squashed
the
miller
when
she
was
five
and
he
was
fifty
divided
her
porridge
with
singing
birds
denied
herself
a
new
nankeen
bonnet
on
the
ground
that
the
turnips
did
not
wear
nankeen
bonnets
neither
did
the
sheep
who
ate
them
who
plaited
straw
and
delivered
the
dreariest
orations
to
all
comers
at
all
sorts
of
unseasonable
times
so
unwieldy
young
dredgers
and
hulking
mudlarks
were
referred
to
the
experiences
of
thomas
twopence
who
having
resolved
not
to
rob
under
circumstances
of
uncommon
atrocity
his
particular
friend
and
benefactor
of
eighteenpence
presently
came
into
supernatural
possession
of
three
and
sixpence
and
lived
a
shining
light
ever
afterwards
note
that
the
benefactor
came
to
no
good
several
swaggering
sinners
had
written
their
own
biographies
in
the
same
strain
it
always
appearing
from
the
lessons
of
those
very
boastful
persons
that
you
were
to
do
good
not
because
it
was
good
but
because
you
were
to
make
a
good
thing
of
it
contrariwise
the
adult
pupils
were
taught
to
read
if
they
could
learn
out
of
the
new
testament
and
by
dint
of
stumbling
over
the
syllables
and
keeping
their
bewildered
eyes
on
the
particular
syllables
coming
round
to
their
turn
were
as
absolutely
ignorant
of
the
sublime
history
as
if
they
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
it
an
exceedingly
and
confoundingly
perplexing
jumble
of
a
school
in
fact
where
black
spirits
and
grey
red
spirits
and
white
jumbled
jumbled
jumbled
jumbled
jumbled
every
night
and
particularly
every
sunday
night
for
then
an
inclined
plane
of
unfortunate
infants
would
be
handed
over
to
the
prosiest
and
worst
of
all
the
teachers
with
good
intentions
whom
nobody
older
would
endure
who
taking
his
stand
on
the
floor
before
them
as
chief
executioner
would
be
attended
by
a
conventional
volunteer
boy
as
executioner
assistant
when
and
where
it
first
became
the
conventional
system
that
a
weary
or
inattentive
infant
in
a
class
must
have
its
face
smoothed
downward
with
a
hot
hand
or
when
and
where
the
conventional
volunteer
boy
first
beheld
such
system
in
operation
and
became
inflamed
with
a
sacred
zeal
to
administer
it
matters
not
it
was
the
function
of
the
chief
executioner
to
hold
forth
and
it
was
the
function
of
the
acolyte
to
dart
at
sleeping
infants
yawning
infants
restless
infants
whimpering
infants
and
smooth
their
wretched
faces
sometimes
with
one
hand
as
if
he
were
anointing
them
for
a
whisker
sometimes
with
both
hands
applied
after
the
fashion
of
blinkers
and
so
the
jumble
would
be
in
action
in
this
department
for
a
mortal
hour
the
exponent
drawling
on
to
my
dearert
childerrenerr
let
us
say
for
example
about
the
beautiful
coming
to
the
sepulchre
and
repeating
the
word
sepulchre
commonly
used
among
infants
five
hundred
times
and
never
once
hinting
what
it
meant
the
conventional
boy
smoothing
away
right
and
left
as
an
infallible
commentary
the
whole
of
flushed
and
exhausted
infants
exchanging
measles
rashes
fever
and
stomach
disorders
as
if
they
were
assembled
in
high
market
for
the
purpose
even
in
this
temple
of
good
intentions
an
exceptionally
sharp
boy
exceptionally
determined
to
learn
could
learn
something
and
having
learned
it
could
impart
it
much
better
than
the
teachers
as
being
more
knowing
than
they
and
not
at
the
disadvantage
in
which
they
stood
towards
the
shrewder
pupils
in
this
way
it
had
come
about
that
charley
hexam
had
risen
in
the
jumble
taught
in
the
jumble
and
been
received
from
the
jumble
into
a
better
school
you
want
to
go
and
see
your
sister
hexam
you
please
mr
headstone
have
half
a
mind
to
go
with
you
where
does
your
sister
live
she
is
not
settled
yet
mr
headstone
i
rather
you
did
see
her
till
she
is
settled
if
it
was
all
the
same
to
you
here
hexam
mr
bradley
headstone
highly
certificated
stipendiary
schoolmaster
drew
his
right
forefinger
through
one
of
the
buttonholes
of
the
boy
coat
and
looked
at
it
attentively
hope
your
sister
may
be
good
company
for
you
do
you
doubt
it
mr
headstone
did
not
say
i
doubted
it
sir
you
did
say
so
bradley
headstone
looked
at
his
finger
again
took
it
out
of
the
buttonhole
and
looked
at
it
closer
bit
the
side
of
it
and
looked
at
it
again
see
hexam
you
will
be
one
of
us
in
good
time
you
are
sure
to
pass
a
creditable
examination
and
become
one
of
us
then
the
question
is
the
boy
waited
so
long
for
the
question
while
the
schoolmaster
looked
at
a
new
side
of
his
finger
and
bit
it
and
looked
at
it
again
that
at
length
the
boy
repeated
question
is
sir
you
had
not
better
leave
well
alone
it
well
to
leave
my
sister
alone
mr
headstone
do
not
say
so
because
i
do
not
know
i
put
it
to
you
i
ask
you
to
think
of
it
i
want
you
to
consider
you
know
how
well
you
are
doing
here
all
she
got
me
here
said
the
boy
with
a
struggle
the
necessity
of
it
acquiesced
the
schoolmaster
making
up
her
mind
fully
to
the
separation
yes
the
boy
with
a
return
of
that
former
reluctance
or
struggle
or
whatever
it
was
seemed
to
debate
with
himself
at
length
he
said
raising
his
eyes
to
the
master
face
wish
you
come
with
me
and
see
her
mr
headstone
though
she
is
not
settled
i
wish
you
come
with
me
and
take
her
in
the
rough
and
judge
her
for
yourself
are
sure
you
would
not
like
asked
the
schoolmaster
prepare
her
sister
lizzie
said
the
boy
proudly
no
preparing
mr
headstone
what
she
is
she
is
and
shows
herself
to
be
there
no
pretending
about
my
sister
his
confidence
in
her
sat
more
easily
upon
him
than
the
indecision
with
which
he
had
twice
contended
it
was
his
better
nature
to
be
true
to
her
if
it
were
his
worse
nature
to
be
wholly
selfish
and
as
yet
the
better
nature
had
the
stronger
hold
i
can
spare
the
evening
said
the
schoolmaster
am
ready
to
walk
with
you
you
mr
headstone
and
i
am
ready
to
go
bradley
headstone
in
his
decent
black
coat
and
waistcoat
and
decent
white
shirt
and
decent
formal
black
tie
and
decent
pantaloons
of
pepper
and
salt
with
his
decent
silver
watch
in
his
pocket
and
its
decent
round
his
neck
looked
a
thoroughly
decent
young
man
of
he
was
never
seen
in
any
other
dress
and
yet
there
was
a
certain
stiffness
in
his
manner
of
wearing
this
as
if
there
were
a
want
of
adaptation
between
him
and
it
recalling
some
mechanics
in
their
holiday
clothes
he
had
acquired
mechanically
a
great
store
of
teacher
knowledge
he
could
do
mental
arithmetic
mechanically
sing
at
sight
mechanically
blow
various
wind
instruments
mechanically
even
play
the
great
church
organ
mechanically
from
his
early
childhood
up
his
mind
had
been
a
place
of
mechanical
stowage
the
arrangement
of
his
wholesale
warehouse
so
that
it
might
be
always
ready
to
meet
the
demands
of
retail
dealers
history
here
geography
there
astronomy
to
the
right
political
economy
to
the
left
natural
history
the
physical
sciences
figures
music
the
lower
mathematics
and
what
not
all
in
their
several
places
this
care
had
imparted
to
his
countenance
a
look
of
care
while
the
habit
of
questioning
and
being
questioned
had
given
him
a
suspicious
manner
or
a
manner
that
would
be
better
described
as
one
of
lying
in
wait
there
was
a
kind
of
settled
trouble
in
the
face
it
was
the
face
belonging
to
a
naturally
slow
or
inattentive
intellect
that
had
toiled
hard
to
get
what
it
had
won
and
that
had
to
hold
it
now
that
it
was
gotten
he
always
seemed
to
be
uneasy
lest
anything
should
be
missing
from
his
mental
warehouse
and
taking
stock
to
assure
himself
suppression
of
so
much
to
make
room
for
so
much
had
given
him
a
constrained
manner
over
and
above
yet
there
was
enough
of
what
was
animal
and
of
what
was
fiery
though
smouldering
still
visible
in
him
to
suggest
that
if
young
bradley
headstone
when
a
pauper
lad
had
chanced
to
be
told
off
for
the
sea
he
would
not
have
been
the
last
man
in
a
ship
crew
regarding
that
origin
of
his
he
was
proud
moody
and
sullen
desiring
it
to
be
forgotten
and
few
people
knew
of
it
in
some
visits
to
the
jumble
his
attention
had
been
attracted
to
this
boy
hexam
an
undeniable
boy
for
a
an
undeniable
boy
to
do
credit
to
the
master
who
should
bring
him
on
combined
with
this
consideration
there
may
have
been
some
thought
of
the
pauper
lad
now
never
to
be
mentioned
be
that
how
it
might
he
had
with
pains
gradually
worked
the
boy
into
his
own
school
and
procured
him
some
offices
to
discharge
there
which
were
repaid
with
food
and
lodging
such
were
the
circumstances
that
had
brought
together
bradley
headstone
and
young
charley
hexam
that
autumn
evening
autumn
because
full
half
a
year
had
come
and
gone
since
the
bird
of
prey
lay
dead
upon
the
the
schools
for
they
were
twofold
as
the
sexes
were
down
in
that
district
of
the
flat
country
tending
to
the
thames
where
kent
and
surrey
meet
and
where
the
railways
still
bestride
the
that
will
soon
die
under
them
the
schools
were
newly
built
and
there
were
so
many
like
them
all
over
the
country
that
one
might
have
thought
the
whole
were
but
one
restless
edifice
with
the
locomotive
gift
of
aladdin
palace
they
were
in
a
neighbourhood
which
looked
like
a
toy
neighbourhood
taken
in
blocks
out
of
a
box
by
a
child
of
particularly
incoherent
mind
and
set
up
anyhow
here
one
side
of
a
new
street
there
a
large
solitary
facing
nowhere
here
another
unfinished
street
already
in
ruins
there
a
church
here
an
immense
new
warehouse
there
a
dilapidated
old
country
villa
then
a
medley
of
black
ditch
sparkling
rank
field
richly
cultivated
brick
viaduct
canal
and
disorder
of
frowziness
and
fog
as
if
the
child
had
given
the
table
a
kick
and
gone
to
sleep
but
even
among
and
all
according
to
pattern
and
all
engendered
in
the
light
of
the
latest
gospel
according
to
monotony

older
pattern
into
which
so
many
fortunes
have
been
shaped
for
good
and

came
out

watering
the
flowers
in
the
little
dusty
bit
of
garden
attached
to
her
small
official
residence
with
little
windows
like

a
little
pincushion
a
little
housewife
a
little
book
a
little
workbox
a
little
set
of
tables
and
weights
and
measures
and
a
little
woman
all
in
one
she
could
write
a
little
essay
on
any
subject
exactly
a
slate
long
beginning
at
the
top
of
one
side
and
ending
at
the
bottom
of
the
other
and
the
essay
should
be
strictly
according
to
rule
if
mr
bradley
headstone
had
addressed
a
written
proposal
of
marriage
to
her
she
would
probably
have
replied
in
a
complete
little
essay
on
the
theme
exactly
a
slate
long
but
would
certainly
have
replied
yes
for
she
loved
him
the
decent
that
went
round
his
neck
and
took
care
of
his
decent
silver
watch
was
an
object
of
envy
to
her
so
would
miss
peecher
have
gone
round
his
neck
and
taken
care
of
him
of
him
insensible
because
he
did
not
love
miss
peecher
miss
peecher
favourite
pupil
who
assisted
her
in
her
little
household
was
in
attendance
with
a
can
of
water
to
replenish
her
little
and
sufficiently
divined
the
state
of
miss
affections
to
feel
it
necessary
that
she
herself
should
love
young
charley
hexam
so
there
was
a
double
palpitation
among
the
double
stocks
and
double
when
the
master
and
the
boy
looked
over
the
little
gate
fine
evening
miss
peecher
said
the
master
very
fine
evening
mr
headstone
said
miss
peecher
you
taking
a
walk
and
i
are
going
to
take
a
long
walk
weather
remarked
miss
peecher
a
long
walk
is
rather
on
business
than
mere
pleasure
said
the
master
miss
peecher
inverting
her
and
very
carefully
shaking
out
the
few
last
drops
over
a
flower
as
if
there
were
some
special
virtue
in
them
which
would
make
it
a
jack
beanstalk
before
morning
called
for
replenishment
to
her
pupil
who
had
been
speaking
to
the
boy
miss
peecher
said
the
master
mr
headstone
said
the
mistress
the
pupil
had
been
in
her
state
of
pupilage
so
imbued
with
the
of
stretching
out
an
arm
as
if
to
hail
a
cab
or
omnibus
whenever
she
found
she
had
an
observation
on
hand
to
offer
to
miss
peecher
that
she
often
did
it
in
their
domestic
relations
and
she
did
it
now
mary
anne
said
miss
peecher
you
please
hexam
said
they
were
going
to
see
his
sister
that
ca
be
i
think
returned
miss
peecher
mr
headstone
can
have
no
business
with
her
mary
anne
again
hailed
mary
anne
you
please
perhaps
it
hexam
business
may
be
said
miss
peecher
did
think
of
that
not
that
it
matters
at
all
mary
anne
again
hailed
mary
anne
say
she
very
handsome
mary
anne
mary
anne
returned
miss
peecher
slightly
colouring
and
shaking
her
head
a
little
out
of
humour
often
have
i
told
you
not
to
use
that
vague
expression
not
to
speak
in
that
general
way
when
you
say
they
say
what
do
you
mean
part
of
speech
they
mary
anne
hooked
her
right
arm
behind
her
in
her
left
hand
as
being
under
examination
and
replied
pronoun
they
person
they
number
how
many
do
you
mean
mary
anne
two
or
more
beg
your
pardon
said
mary
anne
disconcerted
now
she
came
to
think
of
it
i
do
know
that
i
mean
more
than
her
brother
himself
as
she
said
it
she
unhooked
her
arm
felt
convinced
of
it
returned
miss
peecher
smiling
again
pray
mary
anne
be
careful
another
time
he
says
is
very
different
from
they
say
remember
difference
between
he
says
and
they
say
give
it
me
mary
anne
immediately
hooked
her
right
arm
behind
her
in
her
left

an
attitude
absolutely

to
the

indeed
remarked
miss
peecher
with
encouragement
fact
could
not
be
better
do
forget
to
apply
it
another
time
mary
anne
this
said
miss
peecher
finished
the
watering
of
her
flowers
and
went
into
her
little
official
residence
and
took
a
refresher
of
the
principal
rivers
and
mountains
of
the
world
their
breadths
depths
and
heights
before
settling
the
measurements
of
the
body
of
a
dress
for
her
own
personal
occupation
bradley
headstone
and
charley
hexam
duly
got
to
the
surrey
side
of
westminster
bridge
and
crossed
the
bridge
and
made
along
the
middlesex
shore
towards
millbank
in
this
region
are
a
certain
little
street
called
church
street
and
a
certain
little
blind
square
called
smith
square
in
the
centre
of
which
last
retreat
is
a
very
hideous
church
with
four
towers
at
the
four
corners
generally
resembling
some
petrified
monster
frightful
and
gigantic
on
its
back
with
its
legs
in
the
air
they
found
a
tree
near
by
in
a
corner
and
a
forge
and
a
timber
yard
and
a
dealer
in
old
iron
what
a
rusty
portion
of
a
boiler
and
a
great
iron
wheel
or
so
meant
by
lying
in
the
dealer
nobody
seemed
to
know
or
to
want
to
know
like
the
miller
of
questionable
jollity
in
the
song
they
cared
for
nobody
no
not
they
and
nobody
cared
for
them
after
making
the
round
of
this
place
and
noting
that
there
was
a
deadly
kind
of
repose
on
it
more
as
though
it
had
taken
laudanum
than
fallen
into
a
natural
rest
they
stopped
at
the
point
where
the
street
and
the
square
joined
and
where
there
were
some
little
quiet
houses
in
a
row
to
these
charley
hexam
finally
led
the
way
and
at
one
of
these
stopped
must
be
where
my
sister
lives
sir
this
is
where
she
came
for
a
temporary
lodging
soon
after
father
death
often
have
you
seen
her
since
only
twice
sir
returned
the
boy
with
his
former
reluctance
that
as
much
her
doing
as
mine
does
she
support
herself
was
always
a
fair
needlewoman
and
she
keeps
the
stockroom
of
a
seaman
outfitter
she
ever
work
at
her
own
lodging
here
but
her
regular
hours
and
regular
occupation
are
at
their
place
of
business
i
believe
sir
this
is
the
number
the
boy
knocked
at
a
door
and
the
door
promptly
opened
with
a
spring
and
a
click
a
parlour
door
within
a
small
entry
stood
open
and
disclosed
a
child
a
dwarf
a
girl
a
something
sitting
on
a
little
low
which
had
a
kind
of
little
working
bench
before
it
ca
get
up
said
the
child
my
back
bad
and
my
legs
are
queer
but
i
the
person
of
the
house
else
is
at
home
asked
charley
hexam
staring
at
home
at
present
returned
the
child
with
a
glib
assertion
of
her
dignity
the
person
of
the
house
what
did
you
want
young
man
wanted
to
see
my
sister
young
men
have
sisters
returned
the
child
me
your
name
young
man
the
queer
little
figure
and
the
queer
but
not
ugly
little
face
with
its
bright
grey
eyes
were
so
sharp
that
the
sharpness
of
the
manner
seemed
unavoidable
as
if
being
turned
out
of
that
mould
it
must
be
sharp
is
my
name
indeed
said
the
person
of
the
house
thought
it
might
be
your
sister
will
be
in
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
am
very
fond
of
your
sister
she
my
particular
friend
take
a
seat
and
this
name
headstone
my
schoolmaster
a
seat
and
would
you
please
to
shut
the
street
door
first
i
ca
very
well
do
it
myself
because
my
back
so
bad
and
my
legs
are
so
queer
they
complied
in
silence
and
the
little
figure
went
on
with
its
work
of
gumming
or
gluing
together
with
a
brush
certain
pieces
of
cardboard
and
thin
wood
previously
cut
into
various
shapes
the
scissors
and
knives
upon
the
bench
showed
that
the
child
herself
had
cut
them
and
the
bright
scraps
of
velvet
and
silk
and
ribbon
also
strewn
upon
the
bench
showed
that
when
duly
stuffed
and
stuffing
too
was
there
she
was
to
cover
them
smartly
the
dexterity
of
her
nimble
fingers
was
remarkable
and
as
she
brought
two
thin
edges
accurately
together
by
giving
them
a
little
bite
she
would
glance
at
the
visitors
out
of
the
corners
of
her
grey
eyes
with
a
look
that
all
her
other
sharpness
ca
tell
me
the
name
of
my
trade
i
be
bound
she
said
after
taking
several
of
these
observations
make
pincushions
said
charley
else
do
i
make
said
bradley
headstone
ha
what
else
do
i
make
you
a
schoolmaster
but
you
ca
tell
me
do
something
he
returned
pointing
to
a
corner
of
the
little
bench
straw
but
i
do
know
what
done
you
cried
the
person
of
the
house
only
make
pincushions
and
to
use
up
my
waste
but
my
straw
really
does
belong
to
my
business
try
again
what
do
i
make
with
my
straw
schoolmaster
and
says
i
give
you
a
clue
to
my
trade
in
a
game
of
forfeits
i
love
my
love
with
a
b
because
she
beautiful
i
hate
my
love
with
a
b
because
she
is
brazen
i
took
her
to
the
sign
of
the
blue
boar
and
i
treated
her
with
bonnets
her
name
bouncer
and
she
lives
in
now
what
do
i
make
with
my
straw
bonnets
ladies
said
the
person
of
the
house
nodding
assent
i
a
doll
dressmaker
hope
it
a
good
business
the
person
of
the
house
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
shook
her
head
poorly
paid
and
i
often
so
pressed
for
time
i
had
a
doll
married
last
week
and
was
obliged
to
work
all
night
and
it
not
good
for
me
on
account
of
my
back
being
so
bad
and
my
legs
so
queer
they
looked
at
the
little
creature
with
a
wonder
that
did
not
diminish
and
the
schoolmaster
said
am
sorry
your
fine
ladies
are
so
inconsiderate
the
way
with
them
said
the
person
of
the
house
shrugging
her
shoulders
again
they
take
no
care
of
their
clothes
and
they
never
keep
to
the
same
fashions
a
month
i
work
for
a
doll
with
three
daughters
bless
you
she
enough
to
ruin
her
husband
the
person
of
the
house
gave
a
weird
little
laugh
here
and
gave
them
another
look
out
of
the
corners
of
her
eyes
she
had
an
elfin
chin
that
was
capable
of
great
expression
and
whenever
she
gave
this
look
she
hitched
this
chin
up
as
if
her
eyes
and
her
chin
worked
together
on
the
same
wires
you
always
as
busy
as
you
are
now
i
slack
just
now
i
finished
a
large
mourning
order
the
day
before
yesterday
doll
i
work
for
lost
a
the
person
of
the
house
gave
another
little
laugh
and
then
nodded
her
head
several
times
as
who
should
moralize
this
world
this
world
you
alone
all
day
asked
bradley
headstone
any
of
the
neighbouring
children
lud
cried
the
person
of
the
house
with
a
little
scream
as
if
the
word
had
pricked
her
talk
of
children
i
ca
bear
children
i
know
their
tricks
and
their
manners
she
said
this
with
an
angry
little
shake
of
her
tight
fist
close
before
her
eyes
perhaps
it
scarcely
required
the
to
perceive
that
the
doll
dressmaker
was
inclined
to
be
bitter
on
the
difference
between
herself
and
other
children
but
both
master
and
pupil
understood
it
so
running
about
and
screeching
always
playing
and
fighting
always
on
the
pavement
and
chalking
it
for
their
games
oh
i
know
their
tricks
and
their
manners
shaking
the
little
fist
as
before
that
not
all
ever
so
often
calling
names
in
through
a
person
keyhole
and
imitating
a
person
back
and
legs
oh
i
know
their
tricks
and
their
manners
and
i
tell
you
what
i
do
to
punish
there
doors
under
the
church
in
the
square
black
doors
leading
into
black
vaults
well
i
open
one
of
those
doors
and
cram
all
in
and
then
i
lock
the
door
and
through
the
keyhole
blow
in
pepper
would
be
the
good
of
blowing
in
pepper
asked
charley
hexam
set
sneezing
said
the
person
of
the
house
make
their
eyes
water
and
when
they
were
all
sneezing
and
inflamed
i
mock
through
the
keyhole
just
as
they
with
their
tricks
and
their
manners
mock
a
person
through
a
person
keyhole
an
uncommonly
emphatic
shake
of
her
little
fist
close
before
her
eyes
seemed
to
ease
the
mind
of
the
person
of
the
house
for
she
added
with
recovered
composure
no
no
no
children
for
me
give
me
it
was
difficult
to
guess
the
age
of
this
strange
creature
for
her
poor
figure
furnished
no
clue
to
it
and
her
face
was
at
once
so
young
and
so
old
twelve
or
at
the
most
thirteen
might
be
near
the
mark
always
did
like
she
went
on
always
kept
company
with
them
so
sensible
sit
so
quiet
do
go
prancing
and
capering
about
and
i
mean
always
to
keep
among
none
but
till
i
marry
i
suppose
i
must
make
up
my
mind
to
marry
one
of
these
days
she
listened
to
a
step
outside
that
caught
her
ear
and
there
was
a
soft
knock
at
the
door
pulling
at
a
handle
within
her
reach
she
said
with
a
pleased
laugh
here
for
instance
is
a
that
my
particular
friend
and
lizzie
hexam
in
a
black
dress
entered
the
room
you
taking
him
to
her
arms
in
the
old
way
of
which
he
seemed
a
little
ashamed
she
saw
no
one
else
there
there
liz
all
right
my
dear
see
here
mr
headstone
come
with
me
her
eyes
met
those
of
the
schoolmaster
who
had
evidently
expected
to
see
a
very
different
sort
of
person
and
a
murmured
word
or
two
of
salutation
passed
between
them
she
was
a
little
flurried
by
the
unexpected
visit
and
the
schoolmaster
was
not
at
his
ease
but
he
never
was
quite
told
mr
headstone
you
were
not
settled
liz
but
he
was
so
kind
as
to
take
an
interest
in
coming
and
so
i
brought
him
how
well
you
look
bradley
seemed
to
think
so
do
she
do
she
cried
the
person
of
the
house
resuming
her
occupation
though
the
twilight
was
falling
fast
believe
you
she
does
but
go
on
with
your
chat
one
and
all
you
one
two
three
my
and
do
mind
me
pointing
this
impromptu
rhyme
with
three
points
of
her
thin
did
expect
a
visit
from
you
charley
said
his
sister
supposed
that
if
you
wanted
to
see
me
you
would
have
sent
to
me
appointing
me
to
come
somewhere
near
the
school
as
i
did
last
time
i
saw
my
brother
near
the
school
sir
to
bradley
headstone
it
easier
for
me
to
go
there
than
for
him
to
come
here
i
work
about
midway
between
the
two
places
do
see
much
of
one
another
said
bradley
not
improving
in
respect
of
ease
with
a
rather
sad
shake
of
her
head
always
does
well
mr
headstone
could
not
do
better
i
regard
his
course
as
quite
plain
before
him
hoped
so
i
am
so
thankful
so
well
done
of
you
charley
dear
it
is
better
for
me
not
to
come
except
when
he
wants
me
between
him
and
his
prospects
you
think
so
mr
headstone
conscious
that
his
was
looking
for
his
answer
that
he
himself
had
suggested
the
boy
keeping
aloof
from
this
sister
now
seen
for
the
first
time
face
to
face
bradley
headstone
stammered
brother
is
very
much
occupied
you
know
he
has
to
work
hard
one
can
not
but
say
that
the
less
his
attention
is
diverted
from
his
work
the
better
for
his
future
when
he
shall
have
established
himself
why
then
it
will
be
another
thing
then
lizzie
shook
her
head
again
and
returned
with
a
quiet
smile
always
advised
him
as
you
advise
him
did
i
not
charley
never
mind
that
now
said
the
boy
are
you
getting
on
well
charley
i
want
for
nothing
have
your
own
room
here
yes
upstairs
and
it
quiet
and
pleasant
and
airy
she
always
has
the
use
of
this
room
for
visitors
said
the
person
of
the
house
screwing
up
one
of
her
little
bony
fists
like
an
and
looking
through
it
with
her
eyes
and
her
chin
in
that
quaint
accordance
this
room
for
visitors
have
you
lizzie
dear
it
happened
that
bradley
headstone
noticed
a
very
slight
action
of
lizzie
hexam
hand
as
though
it
checked
the
doll
dressmaker
and
it
happened
that
the
latter
noticed
him
in
the
same
instant
for
she
made
a
double
eyeglass
of
her
two
hands
looked
at
him
through
it
and
cried
with
a
waggish
shake
of
her
head
caught
you
spying
did
i
it
might
have
fallen
out
so
any
way
but
bradley
headstone
also
noticed
that
immediately
after
this
lizzie
who
had
not
taken
off
her
bonnet
rather
hurriedly
proposed
that
as
the
room
was
getting
dark
they
should
go
out
into
the
air
they
went
out
the
visitors
saying
to
the
doll
dressmaker
whom
they
left
leaning
back
in
her
chair
with
her
arms
crossed
singing
to
herself
in
a
sweet
thoughtful
little
voice
saunter
on
by
the
river
said
bradley
will
be
glad
to
talk
together
as
his
uneasy
figure
went
on
before
them
among
the
evening
shadows
the
boy
said
to
his
sister
petulantly
are
you
going
to
settle
yourself
in
some
christian
sort
of
place
liz
i
thought
you
were
going
to
do
it
before
now
am
very
well
where
i
am
charley
well
where
you
are
i
am
ashamed
to
have
brought
mr
headstone
with
me
how
came
you
to
get
into
such
company
as
that
little
witch
chance
at
first
as
it
seemed
charley
but
i
think
it
must
have
been
by
something
more
than
chance
for
that
child
you
remember
the
bills
upon
the
walls
at
home
the
bills
upon
the
walls
at
home
i
want
to
forget
the
bills
upon
the
walls
at
home
and
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
do
the
same
grumbled
the
boy
what
of
them
child
is
the
grandchild
of
the
old
man
old
man
terrible
drunken
old
man
in
the
list
slippers
and
the
the
boy
asked
rubbing
his
nose
in
a
manner
that
half
expressed
vexation
at
hearing
so
much
and
half
curiosity
to
hear
more
came
you
to
make
that
out
what
a
girl
you
are
child
father
is
employed
by
the
house
that
employs
me
that
how
i
came
to
know
it
charley
the
father
is
like
his
own
father
a
weak
wretched
trembling
creature
falling
to
pieces
never
sober
but
a
good
workman
too
at
the
work
he
does
the
mother
is
dead
this
poor
ailing
little
creature
has
come
to
be
what
she
is
surrounded
by
drunken
people
from
her
cradle
if
she
ever
had
one
charley
do
see
what
you
have
to
do
with
her
for
all
that
said
the
boy
you
charley
the
boy
looked
doggedly
at
the
river
they
were
at
millbank
and
the
river
rolled
on
their
left
his
sister
gently
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
and
pointed
to
it
compensation
restitution
never
mind
the
word
you
know
my
meaning
father
grave
but
he
did
not
respond
with
any
tenderness
after
a
moody
silence
he
broke
out
in
an
tone
be
a
very
hard
thing
liz
if
when
i
am
trying
my
best
to
get
up
in
the
world
you
pull
me
back
charley
you
liz
why
ca
you
let
bygones
be
bygones
why
ca
you
as
mr
headstone
said
to
me
this
very
evening
about
another
matter
leave
well
alone
what
we
have
got
to
do
is
to
turn
our
faces
full
in
our
new
direction
and
keep
straight
on
never
look
back
not
even
to
try
to
make
some
amends
are
such
a
dreamer
said
the
boy
with
his
former
petulance
was
all
very
well
when
we
sat
before
the
fire
when
we
looked
into
the
hollow
down
by
the
flare
but
we
are
looking
into
the
real
world
now
we
were
looking
into
the
real
world
then
charley
understand
what
you
mean
by
that
but
you
are
not
justified
in
it
i
do
want
as
i
raise
myself
to
shake
you
off
liz
i
want
to
carry
you
up
with
me
that
what
i
want
to
do
and
mean
to
do
i
know
what
i
owe
you
i
said
to
mr
headstone
this
very
evening
after
all
my
sister
got
me
well
then
do
pull
me
back
and
hold
me
down
that
all
i
ask
and
surely
that
not
unconscionable
she
had
kept
a
steadfast
look
upon
him
and
she
answered
with
composure
am
not
here
selfishly
charley
to
please
myself
i
could
not
be
too
far
from
that
river
could
you
be
too
far
from
it
to
please
me
let
us
get
quit
of
it
equally
why
should
you
linger
about
it
any
more
than
i
i
give
it
a
wide
berth
ca
get
away
from
it
i
think
said
lizzie
passing
her
hand
across
her
forehead
no
purpose
of
mine
that
i
live
by
it
still
you
go
liz
dreaming
again
you
lodge
yourself
of
your
own
accord
in
a
house
with
a
drunken
tailor
i
suppose
or
something
of
the
sort
and
a
little
crooked
antic
of
a
child
or
old
person
or
whatever
it
is
and
then
you
talk
as
if
you
were
drawn
or
driven
there
now
do
be
more
practical
she
had
been
practical
enough
with
him
in
suffering
and
striving
for
him
but
she
only
laid
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
not
reproachfully
and
tapped
it
twice
or
thrice
she
had
been
used
to
do
so
to
soothe
him
when
she
carried
him
about
a
child
as
heavy
as
herself
tears
started
to
his
eyes
my
word
liz
drawing
the
back
of
his
hand
across
them
mean
to
be
a
good
brother
to
you
and
to
prove
that
i
know
what
i
owe
you
all
i
say
is
that
i
hope
you
control
your
fancies
a
little
on
my
account
i
get
a
school
and
then
you
must
come
and
live
with
me
and
you
have
to
control
your
fancies
then
so
why
not
now
now
say
i
have
vexed
you
have
charley
you
have
say
i
have
hurt
you
have
charley
but
this
answer
was
less
ready
you
are
sure
i
did
mean
to
come
there
mr
headstone
stopping
and
looking
over
the
wall
at
the
tide
to
hint
that
it
time
to
go
kiss
me
and
tell
me
that
you
know
i
did
mean
to
hurt
you
she
told
him
so
and
they
embraced
and
walked
on
and
came
up
with
the
schoolmaster
we
go
your
sister
way
he
remarked
when
the
boy
told
him
he
was
ready
and
with
his
cumbrous
and
uneasy
action
he
stiffly
offered
her
his
arm
her
hand
was
just
within
it
when
she
drew
it
back
he
looked
round
with
a
start
as
if
he
thought
she
had
detected
something
that
repelled
her
in
the
momentary
touch
will
not
go
in
just
yet
said
lizzie
you
have
a
distance
before
you
and
will
walk
faster
without
me
being
by
this
time
close
to
vauxhall
bridge
they
resolved
in
consequence
to
take
that
way
over
the
thames
and
they
left
her
bradley
headstone
giving
her
his
hand
at
parting
and
she
thanking
him
for
his
care
of
her
brother
the
master
and
the
pupil
walked
on
rapidly
and
silently
they
had
nearly
crossed
the
bridge
when
a
gentleman
came
coolly
sauntering
towards
them
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
his
coat
thrown
back
and
his
hands
behind
him
something
in
the
careless
manner
of
this
person
and
in
a
certain
lazily
arrogant
air
with
which
he
approached
holding
possession
of
twice
as
much
pavement
as
another
would
have
claimed
instantly
caught
the
boy
attention
as
the
gentleman
passed
the
boy
looked
at
him
narrowly
and
then
stood
still
looking
after
him
is
it
that
you
stare
after
asked
bradley
said
the
boy
with
a
confused
and
pondering
frown
upon
his
face
is
that
wrayburn
one
bradley
headstone
scrutinized
the
boy
as
closely
as
the
boy
had
scrutinized
the
gentleman
beg
your
pardon
mr
headstone
but
i
could
help
wondering
what
in
the
world
brought
him
here
though
he
said
it
as
if
his
wonder
were
past
at
the
same
time
resuming
the
walk
it
was
not
lost
upon
the
master
that
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
after
speaking
and
that
the
same
perplexed
and
pondering
frown
was
heavy
on
his
face
do
appear
to
like
your
friend
hexam
do
like
him
said
the
boy
not
took
hold
of
me
by
the
chin
in
a
precious
impertinent
way
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
him
said
the
boy
why
nothing
or
it
much
the
same
because
something
i
happened
to
say
about
my
sister
did
happen
to
please
him
he
knows
your
sister
did
at
that
time
said
the
boy
still
moodily
pondering
now
the
boy
had
so
lost
himself
that
he
looked
at
mr
bradley
headstone
as
they
walked
on
side
by
side
without
attempting
to
reply
until
the
question
had
been
repeated
then
he
nodded
and
answered
sir
to
see
her
i
dare
say
ca
be
said
the
boy
quickly
does
know
her
well
enough
i
should
like
to
catch
him
at
it
when
they
had
walked
on
for
a
time
more
rapidly
than
before
the
master
said
clasping
the
pupil
arm
between
the
elbow
and
the
shoulder
with
his
hand
were
going
to
tell
me
something
about
that
person
what
did
you
say
his
name
was
mr
eugene
wrayburn
he
is
what
they
call
a
barrister
with
nothing
to
do
the
first
time
he
came
to
our
old
place
was
when
my
father
was
alive
he
came
on
business
not
that
it
was
his
business
he
never
had
any
business
he
was
brought
by
a
friend
of
his
the
other
times
was
only
one
other
time
that
i
know
of
when
my
father
was
killed
by
accident
he
chanced
to
be
one
of
the
finders
he
was
mooning
about
i
suppose
taking
liberties
with
people
chins
but
there
he
was
somehow
he
brought
the
news
home
to
my
sister
early
in
the
morning
and
brought
miss
abbey
potterson
a
neighbour
to
help
break
it
to
her
he
was
mooning
about
the
house
when
i
was
fetched
home
in
the
afternoon
they
did
know
where
to
find
me
till
my
sister
could
be
brought
round
sufficiently
to
tell
them
and
then
he
mooned
away
is
that
all
all
sir
bradley
headstone
gradually
released
the
boy
arm
as
if
he
were
thoughtful
and
they
walked
on
side
by
side
as
before
after
a
long
silence
between
them
bradley
resumed
the
talk
suppose
your
sister
with
a
curious
break
both
before
and
after
the
words
received
hardly
any
teaching
hexam
any
sir
no
doubt
to
her
father
objections
i
remember
them
in
your
case
yet
your
sister
scarcely
looks
or
speaks
like
an
ignorant
person
has
as
much
thought
as
the
best
mr
headstone
too
much
perhaps
without
teaching
i
used
to
call
the
fire
at
home
her
books
for
she
was
always
full
of
fancies
sometimes
quite
wise
fancies
considering
when
she
sat
looking
at
it
do
like
that
said
bradley
headstone
his
pupil
was
a
little
surprised
by
this
striking
in
with
so
sudden
and
decided
and
emotional
an
objection
but
took
it
as
a
proof
of
the
master
interest
in
himself
it
emboldened
him
to
say
have
never
brought
myself
to
mention
it
openly
to
you
mr
headstone
and
you
my
witness
that
i
could
even
make
up
my
mind
to
take
it
from
you
before
we
came
out
but
it
a
painful
thing
to
think
that
if
i
get
on
as
well
as
you
hope
i
shall
be
i
wo
say
disgraced
because
i
do
mean
rather
put
to
the
blush
if
it
was
known
by
a
sister
who
has
been
very
good
to
me
said
bradley
headstone
in
a
slurring
way
for
his
mind
scarcely
seemed
to
touch
that
point
so
smoothly
did
it
glide
to
another
there
is
this
possibility
to
consider
some
man
who
had
worked
his
way
might
come
to
admire
your
sister
and
might
even
in
time
bring
himself
to
think
of
marrying
your
sister
and
it
would
be
a
sad
drawback
and
a
heavy
penalty
upon
him
if
overcoming
in
his
mind
other
inequalities
of
condition
and
other
considerations
against
it
this
inequality
and
this
consideration
remained
in
full
force
much
my
own
meaning
sir
ay
said
bradley
headstone
you
spoke
of
a
mere
brother
now
the
case
i
have
supposed
would
be
a
much
stronger
case
because
an
admirer
a
husband
would
form
the
connexion
voluntarily
besides
being
obliged
to
proclaim
it
which
a
brother
is
not
after
all
you
know
it
must
be
said
of
you
that
you
could
help
yourself
while
it
would
be
said
of
him
with
equal
reason
that
he
could
true
sir
sometimes
since
lizzie
was
left
free
by
death
i
have
thought
that
such
a
young
woman
might
soon
acquire
more
than
enough
to
pass
muster
and
sometimes
i
have
even
thought
that
perhaps
miss
peecher
the
purpose
i
would
advise
not
miss
peecher
bradley
headstone
struck
in
with
a
recurrence
of
his
late
decision
of
manner
you
be
so
kind
as
to
think
of
it
for
me
mr
headstone
hexam
yes
i
think
of
it
i
think
maturely
of
it
think
well
of
it
their
walk
was
almost
a
silent
one
afterwards
until
it
ended
at
the
there
one
of
neat
miss
peecher
little
windows
like
the
eyes
in
needles
was
illuminated
and
in
a
corner
near
it
sat
mary
anne
watching
while
miss
peecher
at
the
table
stitched
at
the
neat
little
body
she
was
making
up
by
brown
paper
pattern
for
her
own
wearing
miss
peecher
and
miss
peecher
pupils
were
not
much
encouraged
in
the
unscholastic
art
of
needlework
by
government
mary
anne
with
her
face
to
the
window
held
her
arm
up
mary
anne
headstone
coming
home
in
about
a
minute
mary
anne
again
hailed
mary
anne
in
and
locked
his
door
miss
peecher
repressed
a
sigh
as
she
gathered
her
work
together
for
bed
and
transfixed
that
part
of
her
dress
where
her
heart
would
have
been
if
she
had
had
the
dress
on
with
a
sharp
sharp
needle
chapter
still
educational
the
person
of
the
house
doll
dressmaker
and
manufacturer
of
ornamental
pincushions
and
sat
in
her
quaint
little
low
singing
in
the
dark
until
lizzie
came
back
the
person
of
the
house
had
attained
that
dignity
while
yet
of
very
tender
years
indeed
through
being
the
only
trustworthy
person
in
the
house
said
she
breaking
off
in
her
song
the
news
out
of
doors
the
news
in
doors
returned
lizzie
playfully
smoothing
the
bright
long
fair
hair
which
grew
very
luxuriant
and
beautiful
on
the
head
of
the
doll
dressmaker
me
see
said
the
blind
man
why
the
last
news
is
that
i
do
mean
to
marry
your
brother
shaking
her
head
and
her
chin
like
the
boy
do
you
say
to
his
master
say
that
i
think
he
bespoke
lizzie
finished
putting
the
hair
carefully
back
over
the
misshapen
shoulders
and
then
lighted
a
candle
it
showed
the
little
parlour
to
be
dingy
but
orderly
and
clean
she
stood
it
on
the
mantelshelf
remote
from
the
dressmaker
eyes
and
then
put
the
room
door
open
and
the
house
door
open
and
turned
the
little
low
chair
and
its
occupant
towards
the
outer
air
it
was
a
sultry
night
and
this
was
a
arrangement
when
the
day
work
was
done
to
complete
it
she
seated
herself
in
a
chair
by
the
side
of
the
little
chair
and
protectingly
drew
under
her
arm
the
spare
hand
that
crept
up
to
her
is
what
your
loving
jenny
wren
calls
the
best
time
in
the
day
and
night
said
the
person
of
the
house
her
real
name
was
fanny
cleaver
but
she
had
long
ago
chosen
to
bestow
upon
herself
the
appellation
of
miss
jenny
wren
have
been
thinking
jenny
went
on
i
sat
at
work
what
a
thing
it
would
be
if
i
should
be
able
to
have
your
company
till
i
am
married
or
at
least
courted
because
when
i
am
courted
i
shall
make
him
do
some
of
the
things
that
you
do
for
me
he
could
brush
my
hair
like
you
do
or
help
me
up
and
down
stairs
like
you
do
and
he
do
anything
like
you
do
but
he
could
take
my
work
home
and
he
could
call
for
orders
in
his
clumsy
way
and
he
shall
too
i
trot
him
about
i
can
tell
him
jenny
wren
had
her
personal
vanities
happily
for
her
and
no
intentions
were
stronger
in
her
breast
than
the
various
trials
and
torments
that
were
in
the
fulness
of
time
to
be
inflicted
upon
he
may
happen
to
be
just
at
present
or
whoever
he
may
happen
to
be
said
miss
wren
know
his
tricks
and
his
manners
and
i
give
him
warning
to
look
out
you
think
you
are
rather
hard
upon
him
asked
her
friend
smiling
and
smoothing
her
hair
a
bit
replied
the
sage
miss
wren
with
an
air
of
vast
experience
dear
they
do
care
for
you
those
fellows
if
you
not
hard
upon
but
i
was
saying
if
i
should
be
able
to
have
your
company
ah
what
a
large
if
ai
it
have
no
intention
of
parting
company
jenny
say
that
or
you
go
directly
i
so
little
to
be
relied
upon
more
to
be
relied
upon
than
silver
and
gold
as
she
said
it
miss
wren
suddenly
broke
off
screwed
up
her
eyes
and
her
chin
and
looked
prodigiously
knowing
who
comes
here
a
grenadier
what
does
he
want
a
pot
of
beer
and
nothing
else
in
the
world
my
dear
a
man
figure
paused
on
the
pavement
at
the
outer
door
eugene
wrayburn
ai
it
said
miss
wren
i
am
told
was
the
answer
may
come
in
if
you
good
am
not
good
said
eugene
i
come
in
he
gave
his
hand
to
jenny
wren
and
he
gave
his
hand
to
lizzie
and
he
stood
leaning
by
the
door
at
lizzie
side
he
had
been
strolling
with
his
cigar
he
said
it
was
smoked
out
and
gone
by
this
time
and
he
had
strolled
round
to
return
in
that
direction
that
he
might
look
in
as
he
passed
had
she
not
seen
her
brother
said
lizzie
whose
manner
was
a
little
troubled
gracious
condescension
on
our
brother
part
mr
eugene
wrayburn
thought
he
had
passed
my
young
gentleman
on
the
bridge
yonder
who
was
his
friend
with
him
schoolmaster
be
sure
looked
like
it
lizzie
sat
so
still
that
one
could
not
have
said
wherein
the
fact
of
her
manner
being
troubled
was
expressed
and
yet
one
could
not
have
doubted
it
eugene
was
as
easy
as
ever
but
perhaps
as
she
sat
with
her
eyes
cast
down
it
might
have
been
rather
more
perceptible
that
his
attention
was
concentrated
upon
her
for
certain
moments
than
its
concentration
upon
any
subject
for
any
short
time
ever
was
elsewhere
have
nothing
to
report
lizzie
said
eugene
having
promised
you
that
an
eye
should
be
always
kept
on
mr
riderhood
through
my
friend
lightwood
i
like
occasionally
to
renew
my
assurance
that
i
keep
my
promise
and
keep
my
friend
up
to
the
mark
should
not
have
doubted
it
sir
i
confess
myself
a
man
to
be
doubted
returned
eugene
coolly
all
that
are
you
asked
the
sharp
miss
wren
my
dear
said
the
airy
eugene
am
a
bad
idle
dog
why
do
you
reform
and
be
a
good
dog
inquired
miss
wren
my
dear
returned
eugene
nobody
who
makes
it
worth
my
while
have
you
considered
my
suggestion
lizzie
this
in
a
lower
voice
but
only
as
if
it
were
a
graver
matter
not
at
all
to
the
exclusion
of
the
person
of
the
house
have
thought
of
it
mr
wrayburn
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
make
up
my
mind
to
accept
it
pride
said
eugene
think
not
mr
wrayburn
i
hope
not
pride
repeated
eugene
what
else
is
it
the
thing
is
worth
nothing
in
itself
the
thing
is
worth
nothing
to
me
what
can
it
be
worth
to
me
you
know
the
most
i
make
of
it
i
propose
to
be
of
some
use
to
somebody
which
i
never
was
in
this
world
and
never
shall
be
on
any
other
occasion
by
paying
some
qualified
person
of
your
own
sex
and
age
so
many
or
rather
so
few
contemptible
shillings
to
come
here
certain
nights
in
the
week
and
give
you
certain
instruction
which
you
would
want
if
you
had
been
a
daughter
and
sister
you
know
that
it
good
to
have
it
or
you
would
never
have
so
devoted
yourself
to
your
brother
having
it
then
why
not
have
it
especially
when
our
friend
miss
jenny
here
would
profit
by
it
too
if
i
proposed
to
be
the
teacher
or
to
attend
the
lessons
obviously
incongruous
but
as
to
that
i
might
as
well
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
or
not
on
the
globe
at
all
false
pride
lizzie
because
true
pride
shame
or
be
shamed
by
your
thankless
brother
true
pride
would
have
schoolmasters
brought
here
like
doctors
to
look
at
a
bad
case
true
pride
would
go
to
work
and
do
it
you
know
that
well
enough
for
you
know
that
your
own
true
pride
would
do
it
if
you
had
the
ways
and
means
which
false
pride
wo
let
me
supply
very
well
i
add
no
more
than
this
your
false
pride
does
wrong
to
yourself
and
does
wrong
to
your
dead
father
to
my
father
mr
wrayburn
she
asked
with
an
anxious
face
to
your
father
can
you
ask
by
perpetuating
the
consequences
of
his
ignorant
and
blind
obstinacy
by
resolving
not
to
set
right
the
wrong
he
did
you
by
determining
that
the
deprivation
to
which
he
condemned
you
and
which
he
forced
upon
you
shall
always
rest
upon
his
head
it
chanced
to
be
a
subtle
string
to
sound
in
her
who
had
so
spoken
to
her
brother
within
the
hour
it
sounded
far
more
forcibly
because
of
the
change
in
the
speaker
for
the
moment
the
passing
appearance
of
earnestness
complete
conviction
injured
resentment
of
suspicion
generous
and
unselfish
interest
all
these
qualities
in
him
usually
so
light
and
careless
she
felt
to
be
inseparable
from
some
touch
of
their
opposites
in
her
own
breast
she
thought
had
she
so
far
below
him
and
so
different
rejected
this
disinterestedness
because
of
some
vain
misgiving
that
he
sought
her
out
or
heeded
any
personal
attractions
that
he
might
descry
in
her
the
poor
girl
pure
of
heart
and
purpose
could
not
bear
to
think
it
sinking
before
her
own
eyes
as
she
suspected
herself
of
it
she
drooped
her
head
as
though
she
had
done
him
some
wicked
and
grievous
injury
and
broke
into
silent
tears
be
distressed
said
eugene
very
very
kindly
hope
it
is
not
i
who
have
distressed
you
i
meant
no
more
than
to
put
the
matter
in
its
true
light
before
you
though
i
acknowledge
i
did
it
selfishly
enough
for
i
am
disappointed
disappointed
of
doing
her
a
service
how
else
could
he
be
disappointed
wo
break
my
heart
laughed
eugene
wo
stay
by
me
hours
but
i
am
genuinely
disappointed
i
had
set
my
fancy
on
doing
this
little
thing
for
you
and
for
our
friend
miss
jenny
the
novelty
of
my
doing
anything
in
the
least
useful
had
its
charms
i
see
now
that
i
might
have
managed
it
better
i
might
have
affected
to
do
it
wholly
for
our
friend
miss
i
might
have
got
myself
up
morally
as
sir
eugene
bountiful
but
upon
my
soul
i
ca
make
flourishes
and
i
would
rather
be
disappointed
than
try
if
he
meant
to
follow
home
what
was
in
lizzie
thoughts
it
was
skilfully
done
if
he
followed
it
by
mere
fortuitous
coincidence
it
was
done
by
an
evil
chance
opened
out
so
naturally
before
me
said
eugene
ball
seemed
so
thrown
into
my
hands
by
accident
i
happen
to
be
originally
brought
into
contact
with
you
lizzie
on
those
two
occasions
that
you
know
of
i
happen
to
be
able
to
promise
you
that
a
watch
shall
be
kept
upon
that
false
accuser
riderhood
i
happen
to
be
able
to
give
you
some
little
consolation
in
the
darkest
hour
of
your
distress
by
assuring
you
that
i
do
believe
him
on
the
same
occasion
i
tell
you
that
i
am
the
idlest
and
least
of
lawyers
but
that
i
am
better
than
none
in
a
case
i
have
noted
down
with
my
own
hand
and
that
you
may
be
always
sure
of
my
best
help
and
incidentally
of
lightwood
too
in
your
efforts
to
clear
your
father
so
it
gradually
takes
my
fancy
that
i
may
help
you
so
easily
to
clear
your
father
of
that
other
blame
which
i
mentioned
a
few
minutes
ago
and
which
is
a
just
and
real
one
i
hope
i
have
explained
myself
for
i
am
heartily
sorry
to
have
distressed
you
i
hate
to
claim
to
mean
well
but
i
really
did
mean
honestly
and
simply
well
and
i
want
you
to
know
it
have
never
doubted
that
mr
wrayburn
said
lizzie
the
more
repentant
the
less
he
claimed
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
though
if
you
had
quite
understood
my
whole
meaning
at
first
i
think
you
would
not
have
refused
do
you
think
you
would
do
know
that
i
should
mr
wrayburn
then
why
refuse
now
you
do
understand
it
not
easy
for
me
to
talk
to
you
returned
lizzie
in
some
confusion
you
see
all
the
consequences
of
what
i
say
as
soon
as
i
say
it
all
the
consequences
laughed
eugene
take
away
my
disappointment
lizzie
hexam
as
i
truly
respect
you
and
as
i
am
your
friend
and
a
poor
devil
of
a
gentleman
i
protest
i
do
even
now
understand
why
you
hesitate
there
was
an
appearance
of
openness
trustfulness
unsuspecting
generosity
in
his
words
and
manner
that
won
the
poor
girl
over
and
not
only
won
her
over
but
again
caused
her
to
feel
as
though
she
had
been
influenced
by
the
opposite
qualities
with
vanity
at
their
head
will
not
hesitate
any
longer
mr
wrayburn
i
hope
you
will
not
think
the
worse
of
me
for
having
hesitated
at
all
for
myself
and
for
jenny
you
let
me
answer
for
you
jenny
dear
the
little
creature
had
been
leaning
back
attentive
with
her
elbows
resting
on
the
elbows
of
her
chair
and
her
chin
upon
her
hands
without
changing
her
attitude
she
answered
so
suddenly
that
it
rather
seemed
as
if
she
had
chopped
the
monosyllable
than
spoken
it
myself
and
for
jenny
i
thankfully
accept
your
kind
offer
dismissed
said
eugene
giving
lizzie
his
hand
before
lightly
waving
it
as
if
he
waved
the
whole
subject
away
hope
it
may
not
be
often
that
so
much
is
made
of
so
little
then
he
fell
to
talking
playfully
with
jenny
wren
think
of
setting
up
a
doll
miss
jenny
he
said
had
better
not
replied
the
dressmaker
not
are
sure
to
break
it
all
you
children
do
that
makes
good
for
trade
you
know
miss
wren
returned
eugene
as
people
breaking
promises
and
contracts
and
bargains
of
all
sorts
makes
good
for
my
trade
do
know
about
that
miss
wren
retorted
you
had
better
by
half
set
up
a
and
turn
industrious
and
use
it
if
we
were
all
as
industrious
as
you
little
we
should
begin
to
work
as
soon
as
we
could
crawl
and
there
would
be
a
bad
thing
you
mean
returned
the
little
creature
with
a
flush
suffusing
her
face
for
your
backs
and
your
legs
no
no
said
eugene
shocked
to
do
him
justice
at
the
thought
of
trifling
with
her
infirmity
for
business
bad
for
business
if
we
all
set
to
work
as
soon
as
we
could
use
our
hands
it
would
be
all
over
with
the
dolls
dressmakers
something
in
that
replied
miss
wren
have
a
sort
of
an
idea
in
your
noddle
sometimes
then
in
a
changed
tone
of
ideas
my
lizzie
they
were
sitting
side
by
side
as
they
had
sat
at
first
wonder
how
it
happens
that
when
i
am
work
work
working
here
all
alone
in
the
i
smell
flowers
a
commonplace
individual
i
should
say
eugene
suggested
languidly
for
he
was
growing
weary
of
the
person
of
the
house
you
smell
flowers
because
you
do
smell
flowers
i
do
said
the
little
creature
resting
one
arm
upon
the
elbow
of
her
chair
resting
her
chin
upon
that
hand
and
looking
vacantly
before
her
is
not
a
flowery
neighbourhood
it
anything
but
that
and
yet
as
i
sit
at
work
i
smell
miles
of
flowers
i
smell
roses
till
i
think
i
see
the
lying
in
heaps
bushels
on
the
floor
i
smell
fallen
leaves
till
i
put
down
my
hand
so
and
expect
to
make
them
rustle
i
smell
the
white
and
the
pink
may
in
the
hedges
and
all
sorts
of
flowers
that
i
never
was
among
for
i
have
seen
very
few
flowers
indeed
in
my
life
fancies
to
have
jenny
dear
said
her
friend
with
a
glance
towards
eugene
as
if
she
would
have
asked
him
whether
they
were
given
the
child
in
compensation
for
her
losses
i
think
lizzie
when
they
come
to
me
and
the
birds
i
hear
oh
cried
the
little
creature
holding
out
her
hand
and
looking
upward
they
sing
there
was
something
in
the
face
and
action
for
the
moment
quite
inspired
and
beautiful
then
the
chin
dropped
musingly
upon
the
hand
again
dare
say
my
birds
sing
better
than
other
birds
and
my
flowers
smell
better
than
other
flowers
for
when
i
was
a
little
child
in
a
tone
as
though
it
were
ages
ago
children
that
i
used
to
see
early
in
the
morning
were
very
different
from
any
others
that
i
ever
saw
they
were
not
like
me
they
were
not
chilled
anxious
ragged
or
beaten
they
were
never
in
pain
they
were
not
like
the
children
of
the
neighbours
they
never
made
me
tremble
all
over
by
setting
up
shrill
noises
and
they
never
mocked
me
such
numbers
of
them
too
all
in
white
dresses
and
with
something
shining
on
the
borders
and
on
their
heads
that
i
have
never
been
able
to
imitate
with
my
work
though
i
know
it
so
well
they
used
to
come
down
in
long
bright
slanting
rows
and
say
all
together
who
is
this
in
pain
who
is
this
in
pain
when
i
told
them
who
it
was
they
answered
come
and
play
with
us
when
i
said
i
never
play
i
ca
play
they
swept
about
me
and
took
me
up
and
made
me
light
then
it
was
all
delicious
ease
and
rest
till
they
laid
me
down
and
said
all
together
have
patience
and
we
will
come
whenever
they
came
back
i
used
to
know
they
were
coming
before
i
saw
the
long
bright
rows
by
hearing
them
ask
all
together
a
long
way
off
who
is
this
in
pain
who
is
this
in
pain
and
i
used
to
cry
out
o
my
blessed
children
it
poor
me
have
pity
on
me
take
me
up
and
make
me
light
by
degrees
as
she
progressed
in
this
remembrance
the
hand
was
raised
the
late
ecstatic
look
returned
and
she
became
quite
beautiful
having
so
paused
for
a
moment
silent
with
a
listening
smile
upon
her
face
she
looked
round
and
recalled
herself
poor
fun
you
think
me
do
you
mr
wrayburn
you
may
well
look
tired
of
me
but
it
saturday
night
and
i
wo
detain
you
is
to
say
miss
wren
observed
eugene
quite
ready
to
profit
by
the
hint
wish
me
to
go
it
saturday
night
she
returned
my
child
coming
home
and
my
child
is
a
troublesome
bad
child
and
costs
me
a
world
of
scolding
i
would
rather
you
did
see
my
child
doll
said
eugene
not
understanding
and
looking
for
an
explanation
but
lizzie
with
her
lips
only
shaping
the
two
words
father
he
delayed
no
longer
he
took
his
leave
immediately
at
the
corner
of
the
street
he
stopped
to
light
another
cigar
and
possibly
to
ask
himself
what
he
was
doing
otherwise
if
so
the
answer
was
indefinite
and
vague
who
knows
what
he
is
doing
who
is
careless
what
he
does
a
man
stumbled
against
him
as
he
turned
away
who
mumbled
some
maudlin
apology
looking
after
this
man
eugene
saw
him
go
in
at
the
door
by
which
he
himself
had
just
come
out
on
the
man
stumbling
into
the
room
lizzie
rose
to
leave
it
go
away
miss
hexam
he
said
in
a
submissive
manner
speaking
thickly
and
with
difficulty
fly
from
unfortunate
man
in
shattered
state
of
health
give
poor
invalid
honour
of
your
company
it
ai
ai
catching
lizzie
murmured
that
she
had
something
to
do
in
her
own
room
and
went
away
upstairs
my
jenny
said
the
man
timidly
my
jenny
wren
best
of
children
object
dearest
affections
invalid
to
which
the
person
of
the
house
stretching
out
her
arm
in
an
attitude
of
command
replied
with
irresponsive
asperity
along
with
you
go
along
into
your
corner
get
into
your
corner
directly
the
wretched
spectacle
made
as
if
he
would
have
offered
some
remonstrance
but
not
venturing
to
resist
the
person
of
the
house
thought
better
of
it
and
went
and
sat
down
on
a
particular
chair
of
disgrace
cried
the
person
of
the
house
pointing
her
little
finger
bad
old
boy
you
naughty
wicked
creature
what
do
you
mean
by
it
the
shaking
figure
unnerved
and
disjointed
from
head
to
foot
put
out
its
two
hands
a
little
way
as
making
overtures
of
peace
and
reconciliation
abject
tears
stood
in
its
eyes
and
stained
the
blotched
red
of
its
cheeks
the
swollen
under
lip
trembled
with
a
shameful
whine
the
whole
indecorous
threadbare
ruin
from
the
broken
shoes
to
the
scanty
hair
grovelled
not
with
any
sense
worthy
to
be
called
a
sense
of
this
dire
reversal
of
the
places
of
parent
and
child
but
in
a
pitiful
expostulation
to
be
let
off
from
a
scolding
know
your
tricks
and
your
manners
cried
miss
wren
know
where
you
been
to
which
indeed
it
did
not
require
discernment
to
discover
you
disgraceful
old
chap
the
very
breathing
of
the
figure
was
contemptible
as
it
laboured
and
rattled
in
that
operation
like
a
blundering
clock
slave
slave
from
morning
to
night
pursued
the
person
of
the
house
all
for
this
what
do
you
mean
by
it
there
was
something
in
that
emphasized
which
absurdly
frightened
the
figure
as
often
as
the
person
of
the
house
worked
her
way
round
to
it
even
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
it
was
coming
he
collapsed
in
an
extra
degree
wish
you
had
been
taken
up
and
locked
up
said
the
person
of
the
house
wish
you
had
been
poked
into
cells
and
black
holes
and
run
over
by
rats
and
spiders
and
beetles
i
know
their
tricks
and
their
manners
and
they
have
tickled
you
nicely
ai
you
ashamed
of
yourself
my
dear
stammered
the
father
said
the
person
of
the
house
terrifying
him
by
a
grand
muster
of
her
spirits
and
forces
before
recurring
to
the
emphatic
word
do
you
mean
by
it
over
which
had
no
control
was
the
miserable
plea
in
extenuation
circumstance
you
and
control
you
too
retorted
the
person
of
the
house
speaking
with
vehement
sharpness
you
talk
in
that
way
give
you
in
charge
to
the
police
and
have
you
fined
five
shillings
when
you
ca
pay
and
then
i
wo
pay
the
money
for
you
and
you
be
transported
for
life
how
should
you
like
to
be
transported
for
life
like
it
poor
shattered
invalid
trouble
nobody
long
cried
the
wretched
figure
come
said
the
person
of
the
house
tapping
the
table
near
her
in
a
manner
and
shaking
her
head
and
her
chin
know
what
you
got
to
do
put
down
your
money
this
instant
the
obedient
figure
began
to
rummage
in
its
pockets
a
fortune
out
of
your
wages
i
be
bound
said
the
person
of
the
house
it
here
all
you
got
left
every
farthing
such
a
business
as
he
made
of
collecting
it
from
his
pockets
of
expecting
it
in
this
pocket
and
not
finding
it
of
not
expecting
it
in
that
pocket
and
passing
it
over
of
finding
no
pocket
where
that
other
pocket
ought
to
be
this
all
demanded
the
person
of
the
house
when
a
confused
heap
of
pence
and
shillings
lay
on
the
table
no
more
was
the
rueful
answer
with
an
accordant
shake
of
the
head
me
make
sure
you
know
what
you
got
to
do
turn
all
your
pockets
inside
out
and
leave
so
cried
the
person
of
the
house
he
obeyed
and
if
anything
could
have
made
him
look
more
abject
or
more
dismally
ridiculous
than
before
it
would
have
been
his
so
displaying
himself
but
seven
and
eightpence
halfpenny
exclaimed
miss
wren
after
reducing
the
heap
to
order
you
prodigal
old
son
now
you
shall
be
starved
do
starve
me
he
urged
whimpering
you
were
treated
as
you
ought
to
be
said
miss
wren
be
fed
upon
the
skewers
of
cats
meat
only
the
skewers
after
the
cats
had
had
the
meat
as
it
is
go
to
bed
when
he
stumbled
out
of
the
corner
to
comply
he
again
put
out
both
his
hands
and
pleaded
over
which
no
control
along
with
you
to
bed
cried
miss
wren
snapping
him
up
speak
to
me
i
not
going
to
forgive
you
go
to
bed
this
moment
seeing
another
emphatic
upon
its
way
he
evaded
it
by
complying
and
was
heard
to
shuffle
heavily
up
stairs
and
shut
his
door
and
throw
himself
on
his
bed
within
a
little
while
afterwards
lizzie
came
down
we
have
our
supper
jenny
dear
bless
us
and
save
us
we
need
have
something
to
keep
us
going
returned
miss
jenny
shrugging
her
shoulders
lizzie
laid
a
cloth
upon
the
little
bench
more
handy
for
the
person
of
the
house
than
an
ordinary
table
and
put
upon
it
such
plain
fare
as
they
were
accustomed
to
have
and
drew
up
a
stool
for
herself
for
supper
what
are
you
thinking
of
jenny
darling
was
thinking
she
returned
coming
out
of
a
deep
study
i
would
do
to
him
if
he
should
turn
out
a
drunkard
but
he
wo
said
lizzie
take
care
of
that
beforehand
shall
try
to
take
care
of
it
beforehand
but
he
might
deceive
me
oh
my
dear
all
those
fellows
with
their
tricks
and
their
manners
do
deceive
with
the
little
fist
in
full
action
if
so
i
tell
you
what
i
think
i
do
when
he
was
asleep
i
make
a
spoon
red
hot
and
i
have
some
boiling
liquor
bubbling
in
a
saucepan
and
i
take
it
out
hissing
and
i
open
his
mouth
with
the
other
hand
or
perhaps
sleep
with
his
mouth
ready
open
and
i
pour
it
down
his
throat
and
blister
it
and
choke
him
am
sure
you
would
do
no
such
horrible
thing
said
lizzie
i
well
perhaps
i
should
but
i
should
like
to
am
equally
sure
you
would
not
even
like
to
well
you
generally
know
best
only
you
always
lived
among
it
as
i
have
lived
and
your
back
is
bad
and
your
legs
are
not
queer
as
they
went
on
with
their
supper
lizzie
tried
to
bring
her
round
to
that
prettier
and
better
state
but
the
charm
was
broken
the
person
of
the
house
was
the
person
of
a
house
full
of
sordid
shames
and
cares
with
an
upper
room
in
which
that
abased
figure
was
infecting
even
innocent
sleep
with
sensual
brutality
and
degradation
the
dressmaker
had
become
a
little
quaint
shrew
of
the
world
worldly
of
the
earth
earthy
poor
doll
dressmaker
how
often
so
dragged
down
by
hands
that
should
have
raised
her
up
how
often
so
misdirected
when
losing
her
way
on
the
eternal
road
and
asking
guidance
poor
poor
little
doll
dressmaker
chapter
a
piece
of
work
britannia
sitting
meditating
one
fine
day
perhaps
in
the
attitude
in
which
she
is
presented
on
the
copper
coinage
discovers
all
of
a
sudden
that
she
wants
veneering
in
parliament
it
occurs
to
her
that
veneering
is
representative
man
which
can
not
in
these
times
be
doubted
and
that
her
majesty
faithful
commons
are
incomplete
without
him
so
britannia
mentions
to
a
legal
gentleman
of
her
acquaintance
that
if
veneering
will
down
five
thousand
pounds
he
may
write
a
couple
of
initial
letters
after
his
name
at
the
extremely
cheap
rate
of
two
thousand
five
hundred
per
letter
it
is
clearly
understood
between
britannia
and
the
legal
gentleman
that
nobody
is
to
take
up
the
five
thousand
pounds
but
that
being
put
down
they
will
disappear
by
magical
conjuration
and
enchantment
the
legal
gentleman
in
britannia
confidence
going
straight
from
that
lady
to
veneering
thus
commissioned
veneering
declares
himself
highly
flattered
but
requires
breathing
time
to
ascertain
his
friends
will
rally
round
him
above
all
things
he
says
it
behoves
him
to
be
clear
at
a
crisis
of
this
importance
his
friends
will
rally
round
him
the
legal
gentleman
in
the
interests
of
his
client
can
not
allow
much
time
for
this
purpose
as
the
lady
rather
thinks
she
knows
somebody
prepared
to
put
down
six
thousand
pounds
but
he
says
he
will
give
veneering
four
hours
veneering
then
says
to
mrs
veneering
must
work
and
throws
himself
into
a
hansom
cab
mrs
veneering
in
the
same
moment
relinquishes
baby
to
nurse
presses
her
aquiline
hands
upon
her
brow
to
arrange
the
throbbing
intellect
within
orders
out
the
carriage
and
repeats
in
a
distracted
and
devoted
manner
compounded
of
ophelia
and
any
female
of
antiquity
you
may
prefer
must
work
veneering
having
instructed
his
driver
to
charge
at
the
public
in
the
streets
like
the
at
waterloo
is
driven
furiously
to
duke
street
saint
james
there
he
finds
twemlow
in
his
lodgings
fresh
from
the
hands
of
a
secret
artist
who
has
been
doing
something
to
his
hair
with
yolks
of
eggs
the
process
requiring
that
twemlow
shall
for
two
hours
after
the
application
allow
his
hair
to
stick
upright
and
dry
gradually
he
is
in
an
appropriate
state
for
the
receipt
of
startling
intelligence
looking
equally
like
the
monument
on
fish
street
hill
and
king
priam
on
a
certain
incendiary
occasion
not
wholly
unknown
as
a
neat
point
from
the
classics
dear
twemlow
says
veneering
grasping
both
his
hands
the
dearest
and
oldest
of
my
friends
there
can
be
no
more
doubt
about
it
in
future
thinks
twemlow
i
am
are
you
of
opinion
that
your
cousin
lord
snigsworth
would
give
his
name
as
a
member
of
my
committee
i
do
go
so
far
as
to
ask
for
his
lordship
i
only
ask
for
his
name
do
you
think
he
would
give
me
his
name
in
sudden
low
spirits
twemlow
replies
do
think
he
would
political
opinions
says
veneering
not
previously
aware
of
having
any
identical
with
those
of
lord
snigsworth
and
perhaps
as
a
matter
of
public
feeling
and
public
principle
lord
snigsworth
would
give
me
his
name
might
be
so
says
twemlow
and
perplexedly
scratching
his
head
forgetful
of
the
yolks
of
eggs
is
the
more
discomfited
by
being
reminded
how
stickey
he
is
such
old
and
intimate
friends
as
ourselves
pursues
veneering
should
in
such
a
case
be
no
reserve
promise
me
that
if
i
ask
you
to
do
anything
for
me
which
you
do
like
to
do
or
feel
the
slightest
difficulty
in
doing
you
will
freely
tell
me
so
this
twemlow
is
so
kind
as
to
promise
with
every
appearance
of
most
heartily
intending
to
keep
his
word
you
have
any
objection
to
write
down
to
snigsworthy
park
and
ask
this
favour
of
lord
snigsworth
of
course
if
it
were
granted
i
should
know
that
i
owed
it
solely
to
you
while
at
the
same
time
you
would
put
it
to
lord
snigsworth
entirely
upon
public
grounds
would
you
have
any
objection
says
twemlow
with
his
hand
to
his
forehead
have
exacted
a
promise
from
me
have
my
dear
twemlow
you
expect
me
to
keep
it
honourably
do
my
dear
twemlow
the
whole
then
observe
me
urges
twemlow
with
great
nicety
as
if
in
the
case
of
its
having
been
off
the
whole
he
would
have
done
it
directly
the
whole
i
must
beg
you
to
excuse
me
from
addressing
any
communication
to
lord
snigsworth
you
bless
you
says
veneering
horribly
disappointed
but
grasping
him
by
both
hands
again
in
a
particularly
fervent
manner
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
poor
twemlow
should
decline
to
inflict
a
letter
on
his
noble
cousin
who
has
gout
in
the
temper
inasmuch
as
his
noble
cousin
who
allows
him
a
small
annuity
on
which
he
lives
takes
it
out
of
him
as
the
phrase
goes
in
extreme
severity
putting
him
when
he
visits
at
snigsworthy
park
under
a
kind
of
martial
law
ordaining
that
he
shall
hang
his
hat
on
a
particular
peg
sit
on
a
particular
chair
talk
on
particular
subjects
to
particular
people
and
perform
particular
exercises
such
as
sounding
the
praises
of
the
family
varnish
not
to
say
pictures
and
abstaining
from
the
choicest
of
the
family
wines
unless
expressly
invited
to
partake
thing
however
i
can
do
for
you
says
twemlow
that
is
work
for
you
veneering
blesses
him
again
go
says
twemlow
in
a
rising
hurry
of
spirits
the
club
let
us
see
now
what
is
it
minutes
to
eleven
be
says
twemlow
the
club
by
ten
minutes
to
twelve
and
never
leave
it
all
day
veneering
feels
that
his
friends
are
rallying
round
him
and
says
you
thank
you
i
knew
i
could
rely
upon
you
i
said
to
anastatia
before
leaving
home
just
now
to
come
to
you
of
course
the
first
friend
i
have
seen
on
a
subject
so
momentous
to
me
my
dear
twemlow
i
said
to
anastatia
we
must
were
right
you
were
right
replies
twemlow
me
is
she
working
is
says
veneering
cries
twemlow
polite
little
gentleman
that
he
is
tact
is
invaluable
to
have
the
dear
sex
with
us
is
to
have
everything
with
us
you
have
not
imparted
to
me
remarks
veneering
you
think
of
my
entering
the
house
of
commons
think
rejoins
twemlow
feelingly
it
is
the
best
club
in
london
veneering
again
blesses
him
plunges
down
stairs
rushes
into
his
hansom
and
directs
the
driver
to
be
up
and
at
the
british
public
and
to
charge
into
the
city
meanwhile
twemlow
in
an
increasing
hurry
of
spirits
gets
his
hair
down
as
well
as
he
can
which
is
not
very
well
for
after
these
glutinous
applications
it
is
restive
and
has
a
surface
on
it
somewhat
in
the
nature
of
pastry
and
gets
to
the
club
by
the
appointed
time
at
the
club
he
promptly
secures
a
large
window
writing
materials
and
all
the
newspapers
and
establishes
himself
immoveable
to
be
respectfully
contemplated
by
pall
mall
sometimes
when
a
man
enters
who
nods
to
him
twemlow
says
you
know
veneering
man
says
member
of
the
club
twemlow
says
coming
in
for
man
says
hope
he
may
find
it
worth
the
money
yawns
and
saunters
out
towards
six
of
the
afternoon
twemlow
begins
to
persuade
himself
that
he
is
positively
jaded
with
work
and
thinks
it
much
to
be
regretted
that
he
was
not
brought
up
as
a
parliamentary
agent
from
twemlow
veneering
dashes
at
podsnap
place
of
business
finds
podsnap
reading
the
paper
standing
and
inclined
to
be
oratorical
over
the
astonishing
discovery
he
has
made
that
italy
is
not
england
respectfully
entreats
podsnap
pardon
for
stopping
the
flow
of
his
words
of
wisdom
and
informs
him
what
is
in
the
wind
tells
podsnap
that
their
political
opinions
are
identical
gives
podsnap
to
understand
that
he
veneering
formed
his
political
opinions
while
sitting
at
the
feet
of
him
podsnap
seeks
earnestly
to
know
whether
podsnap
rally
round
him
says
podsnap
something
sternly
first
of
all
veneering
do
you
ask
my
advice
veneering
falters
that
as
so
old
and
so
dear
a
friend
yes
that
all
very
well
says
podsnap
have
you
made
up
your
mind
to
take
this
borough
of
on
its
own
terms
or
do
you
ask
my
opinion
whether
you
shall
take
it
or
leave
it
alone
veneering
repeats
that
his
heart
desire
and
his
soul
thirst
are
that
podsnap
shall
rally
round
him
i
be
plain
with
you
veneering
says
podsnap
knitting
his
brows
will
infer
that
i
do
care
about
parliament
from
the
fact
of
my
not
being
there
why
of
course
veneering
knows
that
of
course
veneering
knows
that
if
podsnap
chose
to
go
there
he
would
be
there
in
a
space
of
time
that
might
be
stated
by
the
light
and
thoughtless
as
a
jiffy
is
not
worth
my
while
pursues
podsnap
becoming
handsomely
mollified
it
is
the
reverse
of
important
to
my
position
but
it
is
not
my
wish
to
set
myself
up
as
law
for
another
man
differently
situated
you
think
it
is
worth
your
while
and
is
important
to
your
position
is
that
so
always
with
the
proviso
that
podsnap
will
rally
round
him
veneering
thinks
it
is
so
you
do
ask
my
advice
says
podsnap
then
i
wo
give
it
you
but
you
do
ask
my
help
good
then
i
work
for
you
veneering
instantly
blesses
him
and
apprises
him
that
twemlow
is
already
working
podsnap
does
not
quite
approve
that
anybody
should
be
already
working
regarding
it
rather
in
the
light
of
a
liberty
but
tolerates
twemlow
and
says
he
is
a
old
female
who
will
do
no
harm
have
nothing
very
particular
to
do
adds
podsnap
mix
with
some
influential
people
i
had
engaged
myself
to
dinner
but
i
send
mrs
podsnap
and
get
off
going
myself
and
i
dine
with
you
at
eight
it
important
we
should
report
progress
and
compare
notes
now
let
me
see
you
ought
to
have
a
couple
of
active
energetic
fellows
of
gentlemanly
manners
to
go
about
veneering
after
cogitation
thinks
of
boots
and
brewer
i
have
met
at
your
house
says
podsnap
they
do
very
well
let
them
each
have
a
cab
and
go
about
veneering
immediately
mentions
what
a
blessing
he
feels
it
to
possess
a
friend
capable
of
such
grand
administrative
suggestions
and
really
is
elated
at
this
going
about
of
boots
and
brewer
as
an
idea
wearing
an
electioneering
aspect
and
looking
desperately
like
business
leaving
podsnap
at
a
he
descends
upon
boots
and
brewer
who
enthusiastically
rally
round
him
by
at
once
bolting
off
in
cabs
taking
opposite
directions
then
veneering
repairs
to
the
legal
gentleman
in
britannia
confidence
and
with
him
transacts
some
delicate
affairs
of
business
and
issues
an
address
to
the
independent
electors
of
announcing
that
he
is
coming
among
them
for
their
suffrages
as
the
mariner
returns
to
the
home
of
his
early
childhood
a
phrase
which
is
none
the
worse
for
his
never
having
been
near
the
place
in
his
life
and
not
even
now
distinctly
knowing
where
it
is
mrs
veneering
during
the
same
eventful
hours
is
not
idle
no
sooner
does
the
carriage
turn
out
all
complete
than
she
turns
into
it
all
complete
and
gives
the
word
lady
tippins
that
charmer
dwells
over
a
staymaker
in
the
belgravian
borders
with
a
model
in
the
window
on
the
ground
floor
of
a
distinguished
beauty
in
a
blue
petticoat
in
hand
looking
over
her
shoulder
at
the
town
in
innocent
surprise
as
well
she
may
to
find
herself
dressing
under
the
circumstances
lady
tippins
at
home
lady
tippins
at
home
with
the
room
darkened
and
her
back
like
the
lady
at
the
window
though
for
a
different
reason
cunningly
turned
towards
the
light
lady
tippins
is
so
surprised
by
seeing
her
dear
mrs
veneering
so
early
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
pretty
creature
calls
it
that
her
eyelids
almost
go
up
under
the
influence
of
that
emotion
to
whom
mrs
veneering
incoherently
communicates
how
that
veneering
has
been
offered
how
that
it
is
the
time
for
rallying
round
how
that
veneering
has
said
must
work
how
that
she
is
here
as
a
wife
and
mother
to
entreat
lady
tippins
to
work
how
that
the
carriage
is
at
lady
tippins
disposal
for
purposes
of
work
how
that
she
proprietress
of
said
bran
new
elegant
equipage
will
return
home
on
foot
on
bleeding
feet
if
need
be
to
work
not
specifying
how
until
she
drops
by
the
side
of
baby
crib
love
says
lady
tippins
yourself
we
bring
him
in
and
lady
tippins
really
does
work
and
work
the
veneering
horses
too
for
she
clatters
about
town
all
day
calling
upon
everybody
she
knows
and
showing
her
entertaining
powers
and
green
fan
to
immense
advantage
by
rattling
on
with
my
dear
soul
what
do
you
think
what
do
you
suppose
me
to
be
you
never
guess
i
pretending
to
be
an
electioneering
agent
and
for
what
place
of
all
places
and
why
because
the
dearest
friend
i
have
in
the
world
has
bought
it
and
who
is
the
dearest
friend
i
have
in
the
world
a
man
of
the
name
of
veneering
not
omitting
his
wife
who
is
the
other
dearest
friend
i
have
in
the
world
and
i
positively
declare
i
forgot
their
baby
who
is
the
other
and
we
are
carrying
on
this
little
farce
to
keep
up
appearances
and
is
it
refreshing
then
my
precious
child
the
fun
of
it
is
that
nobody
knows
who
these
veneerings
are
and
that
they
know
nobody
and
that
they
have
a
house
out
of
the
tales
of
the
genii
and
give
dinners
out
of
the
arabian
nights
curious
to
see
my
dear
say
you
know
come
and
dine
with
they
sha
bore
you
say
who
shall
meet
you
we
make
up
a
party
of
our
own
and
i
engage
that
they
shall
not
interfere
with
you
for
one
single
moment
you
really
ought
to
see
their
gold
and
silver
camels
i
call
their
the
caravan
do
come
and
dine
with
my
veneerings
my
own
veneerings
my
exclusive
property
the
dearest
friends
i
have
in
the
world
and
above
all
my
dear
be
sure
you
promise
me
your
vote
and
interest
and
all
sorts
of
plumpers
for
for
we
could
think
of
spending
sixpence
on
it
my
love
and
can
only
consent
to
be
brought
in
by
the
spontaneous
thingummies
of
the
incorruptible
whatdoyoucallums
now
the
point
of
view
seized
by
the
bewitching
tippins
that
this
same
working
and
rallying
round
is
to
keep
up
appearances
may
have
something
in
it
but
not
all
the
truth
more
is
done
or
considered
to
be
done
which
does
as
well
by
taking
cabs
and
about
than
the
fair
tippins
knew
of
many
vast
vague
reputations
have
been
made
solely
by
taking
cabs
and
going
about
this
particularly
obtains
in
all
parliamentary
affairs
whether
the
business
in
hand
be
to
get
a
man
in
or
get
a
man
out
or
get
a
man
over
or
promote
a
railway
or
jockey
a
railway
or
what
else
nothing
is
understood
to
be
so
effectual
as
scouring
nowhere
in
a
violent
hurry
in
short
as
taking
cabs
and
going
about
probably
because
this
reason
is
in
the
air
twemlow
far
from
being
singular
in
his
persuasion
that
he
works
like
a
trojan
is
capped
by
podsnap
who
in
his
turn
is
capped
by
boots
and
brewer
at
eight
when
all
these
hard
workers
assemble
to
dine
at
veneering
it
is
understood
that
the
cabs
of
boots
and
brewer
must
leave
the
door
but
that
pails
of
water
must
be
brought
from
the
nearest
and
cast
over
the
horses
legs
on
the
very
spot
lest
boots
and
brewer
should
have
instant
occasion
to
mount
and
away
those
fleet
messengers
require
the
analytical
to
see
that
their
hats
are
deposited
where
they
can
be
laid
hold
of
at
an
instant
notice
and
they
dine
remarkably
well
though
with
the
air
of
firemen
in
charge
of
an
engine
expecting
intelligence
of
some
tremendous
conflagration
mrs
veneering
faintly
remarks
as
dinner
opens
that
many
such
days
would
be
too
much
for
her
such
days
would
be
too
much
for
all
of
us
says
podsnap
we
bring
him
in
bring
him
in
says
lady
tippins
sportively
waving
her
green
fan
for
ever
bring
him
in
says
twemlow
bring
him
in
say
boots
and
brewer
strictly
speaking
it
would
be
hard
to
show
cause
why
they
should
not
bring
him
in
having
closed
its
little
bargain
and
there
being
no
opposition
however
it
is
agreed
that
they
must
to
the
last
and
that
if
they
did
not
work
something
indefinite
would
happen
it
is
likewise
agreed
that
they
are
all
so
exhausted
with
the
work
behind
them
and
need
to
be
so
fortified
for
the
work
before
them
as
to
require
peculiar
strengthening
from
veneering
cellar
therefore
the
analytical
has
orders
to
produce
the
cream
of
the
cream
of
his
binns
and
therefore
it
falls
out
that
rallying
becomes
rather
a
trying
word
for
the
occasion
lady
tippins
being
observed
gamely
to
inculcate
the
necessity
of
rearing
round
their
dear
veneering
podsnap
advocating
roaring
round
him
boots
and
brewer
declaring
their
intention
of
reeling
round
him
and
veneering
thanking
his
devoted
friends
one
and
all
with
great
emotion
for
rarullarulling
round
him
in
these
inspiring
moments
brewer
strikes
out
an
idea
which
is
the
great
hit
of
the
day
he
consults
his
watch
and
says
like
guy
fawkes
he
now
go
down
to
the
house
of
commons
and
see
how
things
look
keep
about
the
lobby
for
an
hour
or
so
says
brewer
with
a
deeply
mysterious
countenance
if
things
look
well
i
wo
come
back
but
will
order
my
cab
for
nine
in
the
morning
could
do
better
says
podsnap
veneering
expresses
his
inability
ever
to
acknowledge
this
last
service
tears
stand
in
mrs
veneering
affectionate
eyes
boots
shows
envy
loses
ground
and
is
regarded
as
possessing
a
mind
they
all
crowd
to
the
door
to
see
brewer
off
brewer
says
to
his
driver
is
your
horse
pretty
fresh
eyeing
the
animal
with
critical
scrutiny
driver
says
he
as
fresh
as
butter
him
along
then
says
brewer
of
commons
driver
darts
up
brewer
leaps
in
they
cheer
him
as
he
departs
and
mr
podsnap
says
my
words
sir
that
a
man
of
resource
that
a
man
to
make
his
way
in
life
when
the
time
comes
for
veneering
to
deliver
a
neat
and
appropriate
stammer
to
the
men
of
only
podsnap
and
twemlow
accompany
him
by
railway
to
that
sequestered
spot
the
legal
gentleman
is
at
the
branch
station
with
an
open
carriage
with
a
printed
bill
for
ever
stuck
upon
it
as
if
it
were
a
wall
and
they
gloriously
proceed
amidst
the
grins
of
the
populace
to
a
feeble
little
town
hall
on
crutches
with
some
onions
and
bootlaces
under
it
which
the
legal
gentleman
says
are
a
market
and
from
the
front
window
of
that
edifice
veneering
speaks
to
the
listening
earth
in
the
moment
of
his
taking
his
hat
off
podsnap
as
per
agreement
made
with
mrs
veneering
telegraphs
to
that
wife
and
mother
up
veneering
loses
his
way
in
the
usual
no
thoroughfares
of
speech
and
podsnap
and
twemlow
say
hear
hear
and
sometimes
when
he
ca
by
any
means
back
himself
out
of
some
very
unlucky
no
thoroughfare
with
an
air
of
facetious
conviction
as
if
the
ingenuity
of
the
thing
gave
them
a
sensation
of
exquisite
pleasure
but
veneering
makes
two
remarkably
good
points
so
good
that
they
are
supposed
to
have
been
suggested
to
him
by
the
legal
gentleman
in
confidence
while
briefly
conferring
on
the
stairs
point
the
first
is
this
veneering
institutes
an
original
comparison
between
the
country
and
a
ship
pointedly
calling
the
ship
the
vessel
of
the
state
and
the
minister
the
man
at
the
helm
veneering
object
is
to
let
know
that
his
friend
on
his
right
podsnap
is
a
man
of
wealth
consequently
says
he
gentlemen
when
the
timbers
of
the
vessel
of
the
state
are
unsound
and
the
man
at
the
helm
is
unskilful
would
those
great
marine
insurers
who
rank
among
our
would
they
insure
her
gentlemen
would
they
underwrite
her
would
they
incur
a
risk
in
her
would
they
have
confidence
in
her
why
gentlemen
if
i
appealed
to
my
honourable
friend
upon
my
right
himself
among
the
greatest
and
most
respected
of
that
great
and
much
respected
class
he
would
answer
no
point
the
second
is
this
the
telling
fact
that
twemlow
is
related
to
lord
snigsworth
must
be
let
off
veneering
supposes
a
state
of
public
affairs
that
probably
never
could
by
any
possibility
exist
though
this
is
not
quite
certain
in
consequence
of
his
picture
being
unintelligible
to
himself
and
everybody
else
and
thus
proceeds
gentlemen
if
i
were
to
indicate
such
a
programme
to
any
class
of
society
i
say
it
would
be
received
with
derision
would
be
pointed
at
by
the
finger
of
scorn
if
i
indicated
such
a
programme
to
any
worthy
and
intelligent
tradesman
of
your
town
nay
i
will
here
be
personal
and
say
our
town
what
would
he
reply
he
would
reply
away
with
it
that
what
he
would
reply
gentlemen
in
his
honest
indignation
he
would
reply
away
with
it
but
suppose
i
mounted
higher
in
the
social
scale
suppose
i
drew
my
arm
through
the
arm
of
my
respected
friend
upon
my
left
and
walking
with
him
through
the
ancestral
woods
of
his
family
and
under
the
spreading
beeches
of
snigsworthy
park
approached
the
noble
hall
crossed
the
courtyard
entered
by
the
door
went
up
the
staircase
and
passing
from
room
to
room
found
myself
at
last
in
the
august
presence
of
my
friend
near
kinsman
lord
snigsworth
and
suppose
i
said
to
that
venerable
earl
my
lord
i
am
here
before
your
lordship
presented
by
your
lordship
near
kinsman
my
friend
upon
my
left
to
indicate
that
programme
what
would
his
lordship
answer
why
he
would
answer
away
with
it
that
what
he
would
answer
gentlemen
away
with
it
unconsciously
using
in
his
exalted
sphere
the
exact
language
of
the
worthy
and
intelligent
tradesman
of
our
town
the
near
and
dear
kinsman
of
my
friend
upon
my
left
would
answer
in
his
wrath
away
with
it
veneering
finishes
with
this
last
success
and
mr
podsnap
telegraphs
to
mrs
veneering
down
then
dinner
is
had
at
the
hotel
with
the
legal
gentleman
and
then
there
are
in
due
succession
nomination
and
declaration
finally
mr
podsnap
telegraphs
to
mrs
veneering
have
brought
him
in
another
gorgeous
dinner
awaits
them
on
their
return
to
the
veneering
halls
and
lady
tippins
awaits
them
and
boots
and
brewer
await
them
there
is
a
modest
assertion
on
everybody
part
that
everybody
him
in
but
in
the
main
it
is
conceded
by
all
that
that
stroke
of
business
on
brewer
part
in
going
down
to
the
house
that
night
to
see
how
things
looked
was
the
a
touching
little
incident
is
related
by
mrs
veneering
in
the
course
of
the
evening
mrs
veneering
is
habitually
disposed
to
be
tearful
and
has
an
extra
disposition
that
way
after
her
late
excitement
previous
to
withdrawing
from
the
with
lady
tippins
she
says
in
a
pathetic
and
physically
weak
manner
will
all
think
it
foolish
of
me
i
know
but
i
must
mention
it
as
i
sat
by
baby
crib
on
the
night
before
the
election
baby
was
very
uneasy
in
her
sleep
the

chapter
cupid
prompted
to
use
the
cold
language
of
the
world
mrs
alfred
lammle
rapidly
improved
the
acquaintance
of
miss
podsnap
to
use
the
warm
language
of
mrs
lammle
she
and
her
sweet
georgiana
soon
became
one
in
heart
in
mind
in
sentiment
in
soul
whenever
georgiana
could
escape
from
the
thraldom
of
podsnappery
could
throw
off
the
bedclothes
of
the
phaeton
and
get
up
could
shrink
out
of
the
range
of
her
mother
rocking
and
so
to
speak
rescue
her
poor
little
frosty
toes
from
being
rocked
over
she
repaired
to
her
friend
mrs
alfred
lammle
mrs
podsnap
by
no
means
objected
as
a
consciously
woman
accustomed
to
overhear
herself
so
denominated
by
elderly
osteologists
pursuing
their
studies
in
dinner
society
mrs
podsnap
could
dispense
with
her
daughter
mr
podsnap
for
his
part
on
being
informed
where
georgiana
was
swelled
with
patronage
of
the
lammles
that
they
when
unable
to
lay
hold
of
him
should
respectfully
grasp
at
the
hem
of
his
mantle
that
they
when
they
could
not
bask
in
the
glory
of
him
the
sun
should
take
up
with
the
pale
reflected
light
of
the
watery
young
moon
his
daughter
appeared
quite
natural
becoming
and
proper
it
gave
him
a
better
opinion
of
the
discretion
of
the
lammles
than
he
had
heretofore
held
as
showing
that
they
appreciated
the
value
of
the
connexion
so
georgiana
repairing
to
her
friend
mr
podsnap
went
out
to
dinner
and
to
dinner
and
yet
to
dinner
arm
in
arm
with
mrs
podsnap
settling
his
obstinate
head
in
his
cravat
and
much
as
if
he
were
performing
on
the
pandean
pipes
in
his
own
honour
the
triumphal
march
see
the
conquering
podsnap
comes
sound
the
trumpets
beat
the
drums
it
was
a
trait
in
mr
podsnap
character
and
in
one
form
or
other
it
will
be
generally
seen
to
pervade
the
depths
and
shallows
of
podsnappery
that
he
could
not
endure
a
hint
of
disparagement
of
any
friend
or
acquaintance
of
his
dare
you
he
would
seem
to
say
in
such
a
case
do
you
mean
i
have
licensed
this
person
this
person
has
taken
out
my
certificate
through
this
person
you
strike
at
me
podsnap
the
great
and
it
is
not
that
i
particularly
care
for
the
person
dignity
but
that
i
do
most
particularly
care
for
podsnap
hence
if
any
one
in
his
presence
had
presumed
to
doubt
the
responsibility
of
the
lammles
he
would
have
been
mightily
huffed
not
that
any
one
did
for
veneering
was
always
the
authority
for
their
being
very
rich
and
perhaps
believed
it
as
indeed
he
might
if
he
chose
for
anything
he
knew
of
the
matter
mr
and
mrs
lammle
house
in
sackville
street
piccadilly
was
but
a
temporary
residence
it
has
done
well
enough
they
informed
their
friends
for
mr
lammle
when
a
bachelor
but
it
would
not
do
now
so
they
were
always
looking
at
palatial
residences
in
the
best
situations
and
always
very
nearly
taking
or
buying
one
but
never
quite
concluding
the
bargain
hereby
they
made
for
themselves
a
shining
little
reputation
apart
people
said
on
seeing
a
vacant
palatial
residence
very
thing
for
the
lammles
and
wrote
to
the
lammles
about
it
and
the
lammles
always
went
to
look
at
it
but
unfortunately
it
never
exactly
answered
in
short
they
suffered
so
many
disappointments
that
they
began
to
think
it
would
be
necessary
to
build
a
palatial
residence
and
hereby
they
made
another
shining
reputation
many
persons
of
their
acquaintance
becoming
by
anticipation
dissatisfied
with
their
own
houses
and
envious
of
the
lammle
structure
the
handsome
fittings
and
furnishings
of
the
house
in
sackville
street
were
piled
thick
and
high
over
the
skeleton
and
if
it
ever
whispered
from
under
its
load
of
upholstery
i
am
in
the
closet
it
was
to
very
few
ears
and
certainly
never
to
miss
podsnap
what
miss
podsnap
was
particularly
charmed
with
next
to
the
graces
of
her
friend
was
the
happiness
of
her
friend
married
life
this
was
frequently
their
theme
of
conversation
am
sure
said
miss
podsnap
lammle
is
like
a
lover
at
least
i
i
should
think
he
was
darling
said
mrs
lammle
holding
up
a
forefinger
care
my
goodness
me
exclaimed
miss
podsnap
reddening
have
i
said
now
you
know
hinted
mrs
lammle
playfully
shaking
her
head
were
never
to
say
mr
lammle
any
more
georgiana
alfred
then
i
am
glad
it
no
worse
i
was
afraid
i
had
said
something
shocking
i
am
always
saying
something
wrong
to
ma
me
georgiana
dearest
not
to
you
you
are
not
ma
i
wish
you
were
mrs
lammle
bestowed
a
sweet
and
loving
smile
upon
her
friend
which
miss
podsnap
returned
as
she
best
could
they
sat
at
lunch
in
mrs
own
boudoir
so
dearest
georgiana
alfred
is
like
your
notion
of
a
lover
do
say
that
sophronia
georgiana
replied
beginning
to
conceal
her
elbows
have
any
notion
of
a
lover
the
dreadful
wretches
that
ma
brings
up
at
places
to
torment
me
are
not
lovers
i
only
mean
that
mr
dearest
georgiana
alfred
much
better
darling
loves
you
so
he
always
treats
you
with
such
delicate
gallantry
and
attention
now
do
he
my
dear
said
mrs
lammle
with
a
rather
singular
expression
crossing
her
face
believe
that
he
loves
me
fully
as
much
as
i
love
him
what
happiness
exclaimed
miss
podsnap
do
you
know
my
georgiana
mrs
lammle
resumed
presently
there
is
something
suspicious
in
your
enthusiastic
sympathy
with
alfred
tenderness
gracious
no
i
hope
not
it
rather
suggest
said
mrs
lammle
archly
my
georgiana
little
heart
is
do
miss
podsnap
blushingly
besought
her
do
i
assure
you
sophronia
that
i
only
praise
alfred
because
he
is
your
husband
and
so
fond
of
you
sophronia
glance
was
as
if
a
rather
new
light
broke
in
upon
her
it
shaded
off
into
a
cool
smile
as
she
said
with
her
eyes
upon
her
lunch
and
her
eyebrows
raised
are
quite
wrong
my
love
in
your
guess
at
my
meaning
what
i
insinuated
was
that
my
georgiana
little
heart
was
growing
conscious
of
a
vacancy
no
no
said
georgiana
would
have
anybody
say
anything
to
me
in
that
way
for
i
do
know
how
many
thousand
pounds
what
way
my
georgiana
inquired
mrs
lammle
still
smiling
coolly
with
her
eyes
upon
her
lunch
and
her
eyebrows
raised
know
returned
poor
little
miss
podsnap
think
i
should
go
out
of
my
mind
sophronia
with
vexation
and
shyness
and
detestation
if
anybody
did
it
enough
for
me
to
see
how
loving
you
and
your
husband
are
that
a
different
thing
i
could
bear
to
have
anything
of
that
sort
going
on
with
myself
i
should
beg
and
pray
to
to
have
the
person
taken
away
and
trampled
upon
ah
here
was
alfred
having
stolen
in
unobserved
he
playfully
leaned
on
the
back
of
sophronia
chair
and
as
miss
podsnap
saw
him
put
one
of
sophronia
wandering
locks
to
his
lips
and
waved
a
kiss
from
it
towards
miss
podsnap
is
this
about
husbands
and
detestations
inquired
the
captivating
alfred
they
say
returned
his
wife
listeners
never
hear
any
good
of
themselves
though
you
but
pray
how
long
have
you
been
here
sir
instant
arrived
my
own
i
may
go
on
though
if
you
had
been
here
but
a
moment
or
two
sooner
you
would
have
heard
your
praises
sounded
by
georgiana
if
they
were
to
be
called
praises
at
all
which
i
really
think
they
were
explained
miss
podsnap
in
a
flutter
being
so
devoted
to
sophronia
murmured
alfred
life
and
kissed
her
hand
in
return
for
which
she
kissed
his
it
was
not
i
who
was
to
be
taken
away
and
trampled
upon
i
hope
said
alfred
drawing
a
seat
between
them
georgiana
my
soul
replied
his
wife
alfred
touchingly
appealed
to
georgiana
it
was
nobody
replied
miss
podsnap
was
nonsense
if
you
are
determined
to
know
mr
inquisitive
pet
as
i
suppose
you
are
said
the
happy
and
fond
sophronia
smiling
was
any
one
who
should
venture
to
aspire
to
georgiana
my
love
remonstrated
mr
lammle
becoming
graver
are
not
serious
my
love
returned
his
wife
dare
say
georgiana
was
not
but
i
am
this
said
mr
lammle
the
accidental
combinations
that
there
are
in
things
could
you
believe
my
ownest
that
i
came
in
here
with
the
name
of
an
aspirant
to
our
georgiana
on
my
lips
course
i
could
believe
alfred
said
mrs
lammle
that
you
told
me
dear
one
and
i
anything
that
you
told
me
how
delightful
those
interchanges
and
the
looks
accompanying
them
now
if
the
skeleton
had
taken
that
opportunity
for
instance
of
calling
out
i
am
suffocating
in
the
closet
give
you
my
honour
my
dear
sophronia
i
know
what
that
is
love
said
she
do
my
darling
that
i
came
into
the
room
all
but
uttering
young
fledgeby
name
tell
georgiana
dearest
about
young
fledgeby
no
do
please
do
cried
miss
podsnap
putting
her
fingers
in
her
ears
rather
not
mrs
lammle
laughed
in
her
gayest
manner
and
removing
her
unresisting
hands
and
playfully
holding
them
in
her
own
at
length
sometimes
near
together
and
sometimes
wide
apart
went
on
must
know
you
dearly
beloved
little
goose
that
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
certain
person
called
young
fledgeby
and
this
young
fledgeby
who
was
of
an
excellent
family
and
rich
was
known
to
two
other
certain
persons
dearly
attached
to
one
another
and
called
mr
and
mrs
alfred
lammle
so
this
young
fledgeby
being
one
night
at
the
play
there
sees
with
mr
and
mrs
alfred
lammle
a
certain
heroine
called
do
say
georgiana
podsnap
pleaded
that
young
lady
almost
in
tears
do
oh
do
do
do
say
somebody
else
not
georgiana
podsnap
oh
do
do
do
other
said
mrs
lammle
laughing
airily
and
full
of
affectionate
blandishments
opening
and
closing
georgiana
arms
like
a
pair
of
compasses
my
little
georgiana
podsnap
so
this
young
fledgeby
goes
to
that
alfred
lammle
and
says
do
georgiana
as
if
the
supplication
were
being
squeezed
out
of
her
by
powerful
compression
so
hate
him
for
saying
it
saying
what
my
dear
laughed
mrs
lammle
i
do
know
what
he
said
cried
georgiana
wildly
i
hate
him
all
the
same
for
saying
it
dear
said
mrs
lammle
always
laughing
in
her
most
captivating
way
poor
young
fellow
only
says
that
he
is
stricken
all
of
a
heap
what
shall
i
ever
do
interposed
georgiana
my
goodness
what
a
fool
he
must
be
and
implores
to
be
asked
to
dinner
and
to
make
a
fourth
at
the
play
another
time
and
so
he
dines
and
goes
to
the
opera
with
us
that
all
except
my
dear
georgiana
and
what
will
you
think
of
this
that
he
is
infinitely
shyer
than
you
and
far
more
afraid
of
you
than
you
ever
were
of
any
one
in
all
your
days
in
perturbation
of
mind
miss
podsnap
still
fumed
and
plucked
at
her
hands
a
little
but
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
notion
of
being
afraid
of
her
with
that
advantage
sophronia
flattered
her
and
rallied
her
more
successfully
and
then
the
insinuating
alfred
flattered
her
and
rallied
her
and
promised
that
at
any
moment
when
she
might
require
that
service
at
his
hands
he
would
take
young
fledgeby
out
and
trample
on
him
thus
it
remained
amicably
understood
that
young
fledgeby
was
to
come
to
admire
and
that
georgiana
was
to
come
to
be
admired
and
georgiana
with
the
entirely
new
sensation
in
her
breast
of
having
that
prospect
before
her
and
with
many
kisses
from
her
dear
sophronia
in
present
possession
preceded
six
feet
one
of
discontented
footman
an
amount
of
the
article
that
always
came
for
her
when
she
walked
home
to
her
father
dwelling
the
happy
pair
being
left
together
mrs
lammle
said
to
her
husband
i
understand
this
girl
sir
your
dangerous
fascinations
have
produced
some
effect
upon
her
i
mention
the
conquest
in
good
time
because
i
apprehend
your
scheme
to
be
more
important
to
you
than
your
vanity
there
was
a
mirror
on
the
wall
before
them
and
her
eyes
just
caught
him
smirking
in
it
she
gave
the
reflected
image
a
look
of
the
deepest
disdain
and
the
image
received
it
in
the
glass
next
moment
they
quietly
eyed
each
other
as
if
they
the
principals
had
had
no
part
in
that
expressive
transaction
it
may
have
been
that
mrs
lammle
tried
in
some
manner
to
excuse
her
conduct
to
herself
by
depreciating
the
poor
little
victim
of
whom
she
spoke
with
acrimonious
contempt
it
may
have
been
too
that
in
this
she
did
not
quite
succeed
for
it
is
very
difficult
to
resist
confidence
and
she
knew
she
had
georgiana
nothing
more
was
said
between
the
happy
pair
perhaps
conspirators
who
have
once
established
an
understanding
may
not
be
of
repeating
the
terms
and
objects
of
their
conspiracy
next
day
came
came
georgiana
and
came
fledgeby
georgiana
had
by
this
time
seen
a
good
deal
of
the
house
and
its
frequenters
as
there
was
a
certain
handsome
room
with
a
billiard
table
in
it
on
the
ground
floor
eating
out
a
backyard
which
might
have
been
mr
lammle
office
or
library
but
was
called
by
neither
name
but
simply
mr
lammle
room
so
it
would
have
been
hard
for
stronger
female
heads
than
georgiana
to
determine
whether
its
frequenters
were
men
of
pleasure
or
men
of
business
between
the
room
and
the
men
there
were
strong
points
of
general
resemblance
both
were
too
gaudy
too
slangey
too
odorous
of
cigars
and
too
much
given
to
horseflesh
the
latter
characteristic
being
exemplified
in
the
room
by
its
decorations
and
in
the
men
by
their
conversation
horses
seemed
necessary
to
all
mr
lammle
friends
as
necessary
as
their
transaction
of
business
together
in
a
gipsy
way
at
untimely
hours
of
the
morning
and
evening
and
in
rushes
and
snatches
there
were
friends
who
seemed
to
be
always
coming
and
going
across
the
channel
on
errands
about
the
bourse
and
greek
and
spanish
and
india
and
mexican
and
par
and
premium
and
discount
and
three
quarters
and
seven
eighths
there
were
other
friends
who
seemed
to
be
always
lolling
and
lounging
in
and
out
of
the
city
on
questions
of
the
bourse
and
greek
and
spanish
and
india
and
mexican
and
par
and
premium
and
discount
and
three
quarters
and
seven
eighths
they
were
all
feverish
boastful
and
indefinably
loose
and
they
all
ate
and
drank
a
great
deal
and
made
bets
in
eating
and
drinking
they
all
spoke
of
sums
of
money
and
only
mentioned
the
sums
and
left
the
money
to
be
understood
as
and
forty
thousand
tom
or
hundred
and
on
every
individual
share
in
the
lot
joe
they
seemed
to
divide
the
world
into
two
classes
of
people
people
who
were
making
enormous
fortunes
and
people
who
were
being
enormously
ruined
they
were
always
in
a
hurry
and
yet
seemed
to
have
nothing
tangible
to
do
except
a
few
of
them
these
mostly
asthmatic
and
who
were
for
ever
demonstrating
to
the
rest
with
gold
which
they
could
hardly
hold
because
of
the
big
rings
on
their
forefingers
how
money
was
to
be
made
lastly
they
all
swore
at
their
grooms
and
the
grooms
were
not
quite
as
respectful
or
complete
as
other
men
grooms
seeming
somehow
to
fall
short
of
the
groom
point
as
their
masters
fell
short
of
the
gentleman
point
young
fledgeby
was
none
of
these
young
fledgeby
had
a
peachy
cheek
or
a
cheek
compounded
of
the
peach
and
the
red
red
red
wall
on
which
it
grows
and
was
an
awkward
youth
exceeding
slim
his
enemies
would
have
said
lanky
and
prone
to
in
the
articles
of
whisker
and
moustache
while
feeling
for
the
whisker
that
he
anxiously
expected
fledgeby
underwent
remarkable
fluctuations
of
spirits
ranging
along
the
whole
scale
from
confidence
to
despair
there
were
times
when
he
started
as
exclaiming
jupiter
here
it
is
at
last
there
were
other
times
when
being
equally
depressed
he
would
be
seen
to
shake
his
head
and
give
up
hope
to
see
him
at
those
periods
leaning
on
a
chimneypiece
like
as
on
an
urn
containing
the
ashes
of
his
ambition
with
the
cheek
that
would
not
sprout
upon
the
hand
on
which
that
cheek
had
forced
conviction
was
a
distressing
sight
not
so
was
fledgeby
seen
on
this
occasion
arrayed
in
superb
raiment
with
his
opera
hat
under
his
arm
he
concluded
his
hopefully
awaited
the
arrival
of
miss
podsnap
and
talked
with
mrs
lammle
in
facetious
homage
to
the
smallness
of
his
talk
and
the
jerky
nature
of
his
manners
fledgeby
familiars
had
agreed
to
confer
upon
him
behind
his
back
the
honorary
title
of
fascination
fledgeby
weather
mrs
lammle
said
fascination
fledgeby
mrs
lammle
thought
it
scarcely
as
warm
as
it
had
been
yesterday
not
said
fascination
fledgeby
with
great
quickness
of
repartee
i
expect
it
will
be
devilish
warm
he
threw
off
another
little
scintillation
out
mrs
lammle
mrs
lammle
answered
for
a
short
drive
people
said
fascination
fledgeby
accustomed
to
take
long
drives
but
it
generally
appears
to
me
that
if
they
make
too
long
they
overdo
it
being
in
such
feather
he
might
have
surpassed
himself
in
his
next
sally
had
not
miss
podsnap
been
announced
mrs
lammle
flew
to
embrace
her
darling
little
georgy
and
when
the
first
transports
were
over
presented
mr
fledgeby
mr
lammle
came
on
the
scene
last
for
he
was
always
late
and
so
were
the
frequenters
always
late
all
hands
being
bound
to
be
made
late
by
private
information
about
the
bourse
and
greek
and
spanish
and
india
and
mexican
and
par
and
premium
and
discount
and
three
quarters
and
seven
eighths
a
handsome
little
dinner
was
served
immediately
and
mr
lammle
sat
sparkling
at
his
end
of
the
table
with
his
servant
behind
his
chair
and
his
doubts
upon
the
subject
of
his
wages
behind
himself
mr
lammle
utmost
powers
of
sparkling
were
in
requisition
for
fascination
fledgeby
and
georgiana
not
only
struck
each
other
speechless
but
struck
each
other
into
astonishing
attitudes
georgiana
as
she
sat
facing
fledgeby
making
such
efforts
to
conceal
her
elbows
as
were
totally
incompatible
with
the
use
of
a
knife
and
fork
and
fledgeby
as
he
sat
facing
georgiana
avoiding
her
countenance
by
every
possible
device
and
betraying
the
discomposure
of
his
mind
in
feeling
for
his
whiskers
with
his
spoon
his
wine
glass
and
his
bread
so
mr
and
mrs
alfred
lammle
had
to
prompt
and
this
is
how
they
prompted
said
mr
lammle
low
and
smiling
and
sparkling
all
over
like
a
harlequin
are
not
in
your
usual
spirits
why
are
you
not
in
your
usual
spirits
georgiana
georgiana
faltered
that
she
was
much
the
same
as
she
was
in
general
she
was
not
aware
of
being
different
aware
of
being
different
retorted
mr
alfred
lammle
my
dear
georgiana
who
are
always
so
natural
and
unconstrained
with
us
who
are
such
a
relief
from
the
crowd
that
are
all
alike
who
are
the
embodiment
of
gentleness
simplicity
and
reality
miss
podsnap
looked
at
the
door
as
if
she
entertained
confused
thoughts
of
taking
refuge
from
these
compliments
in
flight
i
will
be
judged
said
mr
lammle
raising
his
voice
a
little
my
friend
fledgeby
do
miss
podsnap
faintly
ejaculated
when
mrs
lammle
took
the
beg
your
pardon
alfred
my
dear
but
i
can
not
part
with
mr
fledgeby
quite
yet
you
must
wait
for
him
a
moment
mr
fledgeby
and
i
are
engaged
in
a
personal
discussion
fledgeby
must
have
conducted
it
on
his
side
with
immense
art
for
no
appearance
of
uttering
one
syllable
had
escaped
him
personal
discussion
sophronia
my
love
what
discussion
fledgeby
i
am
jealous
what
discussion
fledgeby
i
tell
him
mr
fledgeby
asked
mrs
lammle
trying
to
look
as
if
he
knew
anything
about
it
fascination
replied
tell
him
were
discussing
then
said
mrs
lammle
you
must
know
alfred
whether
mr
fledgeby
was
in
his
usual
flow
of
spirits
that
is
the
very
point
sophronia
that
georgiana
and
i
were
discussing
as
to
herself
what
did
fledgeby
say
a
likely
thing
sir
that
i
am
going
to
tell
you
everything
and
be
told
nothing
what
did
georgiana
say
said
she
was
doing
her
usual
justice
to
herself
and
i
said
she
was
not
exclaimed
mrs
lammle
i
said
to
mr
fledgeby
still
it
would
do
they
would
not
look
at
one
another
no
not
even
when
the
sparkling
host
proposed
that
the
quartette
should
take
an
appropriately
sparkling
glass
of
wine
georgiana
looked
from
her
wine
glass
at
mr
lammle
and
at
mrs
lammle
but
might
could
should
would
look
at
mr
fledgeby
fascination
looked
from
his
wine
glass
at
mrs
lammle
and
at
mr
lammle
but
might
could
should
would
look
at
georgiana
more
prompting
was
necessary
cupid
must
be
brought
up
to
the
mark
the
manager
had
put
him
down
in
the
bill
for
the
part
and
he
must
play
it
my
dear
said
mr
lammle
do
like
the
colour
of
your
dress
appeal
said
mrs
lammle
mr
fledgeby
i
said
mr
lammle
georgiana
my
love
remarked
mrs
lammle
aside
to
her
dear
girl
rely
upon
you
not
to
go
over
to
the
opposition
now
mr
fledgeby
fascination
wished
to
know
if
the
colour
were
not
called
yes
said
mr
lammle
actually
he
knew
everything
it
was
really
fascination
took
to
mean
the
colour
of
roses
in
this
he
was
very
warmly
supported
by
mr
and
mrs
lammle
fascination
had
heard
the
term
queen
of
flowers
applied
to
the
rose
similarly
it
might
be
said
that
the
dress
was
the
queen
of
dresses
happy
fledgeby
from
mr
lammle
notwithstanding
fascination
opinion
was
that
we
all
had
our
eyes
or
at
least
a
large
majority
of
us
and
that
and
and
his
farther
opinion
was
several
ands
with
nothing
beyond
them
mr
fledgeby
said
mrs
lammle
desert
me
in
that
way
oh
mr
fledgeby
to
abandon
my
poor
dear
injured
rose
and
declare
for
blue
victory
cried
mr
lammle
dress
is
condemned
my
dear
what
said
mrs
lammle
stealing
her
affectionate
hand
towards
her
dear
girl
does
georgy
say
says
replied
mr
lammle
interpreting
for
her
in
her
eyes
you
look
well
in
any
colour
sophronia
and
that
if
she
had
expected
to
be
embarrassed
by
so
pretty
a
compliment
as
she
has
received
she
would
have
worn
another
colour
herself
though
i
tell
her
in
reply
that
it
would
not
have
saved
her
for
whatever
colour
she
had
worn
would
have
been
fledgeby
colour
but
what
does
fledgeby
say
says
replied
mrs
lammle
interpreting
for
him
and
patting
the
back
of
her
dear
girl
hand
as
if
it
were
fledgeby
who
was
patting
it
it
was
no
compliment
but
a
little
natural
act
of
homage
that
he
could
resist
and
expressing
more
feeling
as
if
it
were
more
feeling
on
the
part
of
fledgeby
is
right
he
is
right
still
no
not
even
now
would
they
look
at
one
another
seeming
to
gnash
his
sparkling
teeth
studs
eyes
and
buttons
all
at
once
mr
lammle
secretly
bent
a
dark
frown
on
the
two
expressive
of
an
intense
desire
to
bring
them
together
by
knocking
their
heads
together
you
heard
this
opera
of
fledgeby
he
asked
stopping
very
short
to
prevent
himself
from
running
on
into
you
no
not
exactly
said
fledgeby
fact
i
do
know
a
note
of
it
do
you
know
it
georgy
said
mrs
lammle
replied
georgiana
faintly
under
the
sympathetic
coincidence
then
said
mrs
lammle
charmed
by
the
discovery
which
flowed
from
the
premises
neither
of
you
know
it
how
charming
even
the
craven
fledgeby
felt
that
the
time
was
now
come
when
he
must
strike
a
blow
he
struck
it
by
saying
partly
to
mrs
lammle
and
partly
to
the
circumambient
air
consider
myself
very
fortunate
in
being
reserved
by
as
he
stopped
dead
mr
lammle
making
that
gingerous
bush
of
his
whiskers
to
look
out
of
offered
him
the
word
i
was
going
to
say
that
said
fledgeby
was
going
to
say
fate
i
consider
it
very
fortunate
that
fate
has
written
in
the
book
of
in
the
book
which
is
its
own
property
that
i
should
go
to
that
opera
for
the
first
time
under
the
memorable
circumstances
of
going
with
miss
podsnap
to
which
georgiana
replied
hooking
her
two
little
fingers
in
one
another
and
addressing
the
tablecloth
you
but
i
generally
go
with
no
one
but
you
sophronia
and
i
like
that
very
much
content
perforce
with
this
success
for
the
time
mr
lammle
let
miss
podsnap
out
of
the
room
as
if
he
were
opening
her
cage
door
and
mrs
lammle
followed
coffee
being
presently
served
up
stairs
he
kept
a
watch
on
fledgeby
until
miss
podsnap
cup
was
empty
and
then
directed
him
with
his
finger
as
if
that
young
gentleman
were
a
slow
retriever
to
go
and
fetch
it
this
feat
he
performed
not
only
without
failure
but
even
with
the
original
embellishment
of
informing
miss
podsnap
that
green
tea
was
considered
bad
for
the
nerves
though
there
miss
podsnap
unintentionally
threw
him
out
by
faltering
is
it
indeed
how
does
it
act
which
he
was
not
prepared
to
elucidate
the
carriage
announced
mrs
lammle
said
mind
me
mr
fledgeby
my
skirts
and
cloak
occupy
both
my
hands
take
miss
podsnap
and
he
took
her
and
mrs
lammle
went
next
and
mr
lammle
went
last
savagely
following
his
little
flock
like
a
drover
but
he
was
all
sparkle
and
glitter
in
the
box
at
the
opera
and
there
he
and
his
dear
wife
made
a
conversation
between
fledgeby
and
georgiana
in
the
following
ingenious
and
skilful
manner
they
sat
in
this
order
mrs
lammle
fascination
fledgeby
georgiana
mr
lammle
mrs
lammle
made
leading
remarks
to
fledgeby
only
requiring
monosyllabic
replies
mr
lammle
did
the
like
with
georgiana
at
times
mrs
lammle
would
lean
forward
to
address
mr
lammle
to
this
purpose
my
dear
mr
fledgeby
very
justly
says
apropos
of
the
last
scene
that
true
constancy
would
not
require
any
such
stimulant
as
the
stage
deems
necessary
to
which
mr
lammle
would
reply
sophronia
my
love
but
as
georgiana
has
observed
to
me
the
lady
had
no
sufficient
reason
to
know
the
state
of
the
gentleman
affections
to
which
mrs
lammle
would
rejoin
true
alfred
but
mr
fledgeby
points
out
this
to
which
alfred
would
demur
sophronia
but
georgiana
acutely
remarks
that
through
this
device
the
two
young
people
conversed
at
great
length
and
committed
themselves
to
a
variety
of
delicate
sentiments
without
having
once
opened
their
lips
save
to
say
yes
or
no
and
even
that
not
to
one
another
fledgeby
took
his
leave
of
miss
podsnap
at
the
carriage
door
and
the
lammles
dropped
her
at
her
own
home
and
on
the
way
mrs
lammle
archly
rallied
her
in
her
fond
and
protecting
manner
by
saying
at
intervals
little
georgiana
little
georgiana
which
was
not
much
but
the
tone
added
have
enslaved
your
fledgeby
and
thus
the
lammles
got
home
at
last
and
the
lady
sat
down
moody
and
weary
looking
at
her
dark
lord
engaged
in
a
deed
of
violence
with
a
bottle
of
as
though
he
were
wringing
the
neck
of
some
unlucky
creature
and
pouring
its
blood
down
his
throat
as
he
wiped
his
dripping
whiskers
in
an
ogreish
way
he
met
her
eyes
and
pausing
said
with
no
very
gentle
voice
such
an
absolute
booby
necessary
to
the
purpose
know
what
i
am
doing
he
is
no
such
dolt
as
you
suppose
genius
perhaps
sneer
perhaps
and
you
take
a
lofty
air
upon
yourself
perhaps
but
i
tell
you
this
when
that
young
fellow
interest
is
concerned
he
holds
as
tight
as
a
when
money
is
in
question
with
that
young
fellow
he
is
a
match
for
the
devil
he
a
match
for
you
is
almost
as
good
a
one
as
you
thought
me
for
you
he
has
no
quality
of
youth
in
him
but
such
as
you
have
seen
touch
him
upon
money
and
you
touch
no
booby
then
he
really
is
a
dolt
i
suppose
in
other
things
but
it
answers
his
one
purpose
very
well
she
money
in
her
own
right
in
any
case
she
has
money
in
her
own
right
in
any
case
you
have
done
so
well

answer

question

removing
her
one
time
more
and
dropping
her
clean
outside
the
cousinly
pale
but
cousin
for
all
that
among
her
transactions
with
fledgeby
father
fledgeby
mother
had
raised
money
of
him
at
a
great
disadvantage
on
a
certain
reversionary
interest
the
reversion
falling
in
soon
after
they
were
married
fledgeby
father
laid
hold
of
the
cash
for
his
separate
use
and
benefit
this
led
to
subjective
differences
of
opinion
not
to
say
objective
interchanges
of
backgammon
boards
and
other
such
domestic
missiles
between
fledgeby
father
and
fledgeby
mother
and
those
led
to
fledgeby
mother
spending
as
much
money
as
she
could
and
to
fledgeby
father
doing
all
he
could
to
restrain
her
fledgeby
childhood
had
been
in
consequence
a
stormy
one
but
the
winds
and
the
waves
had
gone
down
in
the
grave
and
fledgeby
flourished
alone
he
lived
in
chambers
in
the
albany
did
fledgeby
and
maintained
a
spruce
appearance
but
his
youthful
fire
was
all
composed
of
sparks
from
the
grindstone
and
as
the
sparks
flew
off
went
out
and
never
warmed
anything
be
sure
that
fledgeby
had
his
tools
at
the
grindstone
and
turned
it
with
a
wary
eye
mr
alfred
lammle
came
round
to
the
albany
to
breakfast
with
fledgeby
present
on
the
table
one
scanty
pot
of
tea
one
scanty
loaf
two
scanty
pats
of
butter
two
scanty
rashers
of
bacon
two
pitiful
eggs
and
an
abundance
of
handsome
china
bought
a
secondhand
bargain
did
you
think
of
georgiana
asked
mr
lammle
i
tell
you
said
fledgeby
very
deliberately
my
boy
misunderstand
me
said
fledgeby
do
mean
i
tell
you
that
i
mean
i
tell
you
something
else
me
anything
old
fellow
but
there
you
misunderstand
me
again
said
fledgeby
mean
tell
you
nothing
mr
lammle
sparkled
at
him
but
frowned
at
him
too
here
said
fledgeby
deep
and
you
ready
whether
i
am
deep
or
not
never
mind
i
am
not
ready
but
i
can
do
one
thing
lammle
i
can
hold
my
tongue
and
i
intend
always
doing
it
are
a
fellow
fledgeby
be
or
may
not
be
if
i
am
a
fellow
it
may
amount
to
the
same
thing
now
lammle
i
am
never
going
to
answer
questions
dear
fellow
it
was
the
simplest
question
in
the
world
mind
it
seemed
so
but
things
are
not
always
what
they
seem
i
saw
a
man
examined
as
a
witness
in
westminster
hall
questions
put
to
him
seemed
the
simplest
in
the
world
but
turned
out
to
be
anything
rather
than
that
after
he
had
answered
very
well
then
he
should
have
held
his
tongue
if
he
had
held
his
tongue
he
would
have
kept
out
of
scrapes
that
he
got
into
i
had
held
my
tongue
you
would
never
have
seen
the
subject
of
my
question
remarked
lammle
darkening
lammle
said
fascination
fledgeby
calmly
feeling
for
his
whisker
wo
do
i
wo
be
led
on
into
a
discussion
i
manage
a
discussion
but
i
can
manage
to
hold
my
tongue
mr
lammle
fell
back
upon
propitiation
should
think
you
could
why
when
these
fellows
of
our
acquaintance
drink
and
you
drink
with
them
the
more
talkative
they
get
the
more
silent
you
get
the
more
they
let
out
the
more
you
keep
in
do
object
lammle
returned
fledgeby
with
an
internal
chuckle
being
understood
though
i
object
to
being
questioned
that
certainly
is
the
way
i
do
it
when
all
the
rest
of
us
are
discussing
our
ventures
none
of
us
ever
know
what
a
single
venture
of
yours
is
none
of
you
ever
will
from
me
lammle
replied
fledgeby
with
another
internal
chuckle
certainly
is
the
way
i
do
it
of
course
it
is
i
know
rejoined
lammle
with
a
flourish
of
frankness
and
a
laugh
and
stretching
out
his
hands
as
if
to
show
the
universe
a
remarkable
man
in
fledgeby
i
had
known
it
of
my
fledgeby
should
i
have
proposed
our
little
compact
of
advantage
to
my
fledgeby
remarked
fascination
shaking
his
head
slyly
i
am
not
to
be
got
at
in
that
way
i
am
not
vain
that
sort
of
vanity
do
pay
lammle
no
no
no
compliments
only
make
me
hold
my
tongue
the
more
alfred
lammle
pushed
his
plate
away
no
great
sacrifice
under
the
circumstances
of
there
being
so
little
in
it
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
contemplated
fledgeby
in
silence
then
he
slowly
released
his
left
hand
from
its
pocket
and
made
that
bush
of
his
whiskers
still
contemplating
him
in
silence
then
he
slowly
broke
silence
and
slowly
said
the
is
this
fellow
about
this
morning
look
here
lammle
said
fascination
fledgeby
with
the
meanest
of
twinkles
in
his
meanest
of
eyes
which
were
too
near
together
by
the
way
here
lammle
i
am
very
well
aware
that
i
did
show
to
advantage
last
night
and
that
you
and
your
wife
who
i
consider
is
a
very
clever
woman
and
an
agreeable
woman
did
i
am
not
calculated
to
show
to
advantage
under
that
sort
of
circumstances
i
know
very
well
you
two
did
show
to
advantage
and
managed
capitally
but
do
you
on
that
account
come
talking
to
me
as
if
i
was
your
doll
and
puppet
because
i
am
not
all
this
cried
alfred
after
studying
with
a
look
the
meanness
that
was
fain
to
have
the
meanest
help
and
yet
was
so
mean
as
to
turn
upon
it
this
because
of
one
simple
natural
question
should
have
waited
till
i
thought
proper
to
say
something
about
it
of
myself
i
do
like
your
coming
over
me
with
your
georgianas
as
if
you
was
her
proprietor
and
mine
too
when
you
are
in
the
gracious
mind
to
say
anything
about
it
of
yourself
retorted
lammle
do
have
done
it
i
have
said
you
managed
capitally
you
and
your
wife
both
if
you
go
on
managing
capitally
i
go
on
doing
my
part
only
do
crow
crow
exclaimed
lammle
shrugging
his
shoulders
pursued
the
other
take
it
in
your
head
that
people
are
your
puppets
because
they
do
come
out
to
advantage
at
the
particular
moments
when
you
do
with
the
assistance
of
a
very
clever
and
agreeable
wife
all
the
rest
keep
on
doing
and
let
mrs
lammle
keep
on
doing
now
i
have
held
my
tongue
when
i
thought
proper
and
i
have
spoken
when
i
thought
proper
and
there
an
end
of
that
and
now
the
question
is
proceeded
fledgeby
with
the
greatest
reluctance
you
have
another
egg
i
wo
said
lammle
shortly
you
right
and
will
find
yourself
better
without
it
replied
fascination
in
greatly
improved
spirits
ask
you
if
you
have
another
rasher
would
be
unmeaning
flattery
for
it
would
make
you
thirsty
all
day
will
you
have
some
more
bread
and
butter
i
wo
repeated
lammle
i
will
said
fascination
and
it
was
not
a
mere
retort
for
the
sound
sake
but
was
a
cheerful
cogent
consequence
of
the
refusal
for
if
lammle
had
applied
himself
again
to
the
loaf
it
would
have
been
so
heavily
visited
in
fledgeby
opinion
as
to
demand
abstinence
from
bread
on
his
part
for
the
remainder
of
that
meal
at
least
if
not
for
the
whole
of
the
next
whether
this
young
gentleman
for
he
was
but
combined
with
the
miserly
vice
of
an
old
man
any
of
the
vices
of
a
young
one
was
a
moot
point
so
very
honourably
did
he
keep
his
own
counsel
he
was
sensible
of
the
value
of
appearances
as
an
investment
and
liked
to
dress
well
but
he
drove
a
bargain
for
every
moveable
about
him
from
the
coat
on
his
back
to
the
china
on
his
and
every
bargain
by
representing
somebody
ruin
or
somebody
loss
acquired
a
peculiar
charm
for
him
it
was
a
part
of
his
avarice
to
take
within
narrow
bounds
long
odds
at
races
if
he
won
he
drove
harder
bargains
if
he
lost
he
half
starved
himself
until
next
time
why
money
should
be
so
precious
to
an
ass
too
dull
and
mean
to
exchange
it
for
any
other
satisfaction
is
strange
but
there
is
no
animal
so
sure
to
get
laden
with
it
as
the
ass
who
sees
nothing
written
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
sky
but
the
three
letters
not
luxury
sensuality
dissoluteness
which
they
often
stand
for
but
the
three
dry
letters
your
concentrated
fox
is
seldom
comparable
to
your
concentrated
ass
in
fascination
fledgeby
feigned
to
be
a
young
gentleman
living
on
his
means
but
was
known
secretly
to
be
a
kind
of
outlaw
in
the
line
and
to
put
money
out
at
high
interest
in
various
ways
his
circle
of
familiar
acquaintance
from
mr
lammle
round
all
had
a
touch
of
the
outlaw
as
to
their
rovings
in
the
merry
greenwood
of
jobbery
forest
lying
on
the
outskirts
of
the
and
the
stock
exchange
suppose
you
lammle
said
fledgeby
eating
his
bread
and
butter
did
go
in
for
female
society
replied
lammle
glooming
considerably
under
his
late
treatment
natural
to
you
eh
said
fledgeby
sex
were
pleased
to
like
me
sir
said
lammle
sulkily
but
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
not
been
able
to
help
himself
a
pretty
good
thing
of
marrying
did
you
asked
fledgeby
the
other
smiled
an
ugly
smile
and
tapped
one
tap
upon
his
nose
late
governor
made
a
mess
of
it
said
fledgeby
geor
is
the
right
name
georgina
or
georgiana
was
thinking
yesterday
i
did
know
there
was
such
a
name
i
thought
it
must
end
in
ina
you
play
if
you
can
the
concertina
you
know
replied
fledgeby
meditating
very
slowly
you
have
when
you
catch
it
the
scarlatina
and
you
can
come
down
from
a
balloon
in
a
parach
no
you
ca
though
well
say
georgeute
i
mean
georgiana
were
going
to
remark
of
georgiana
lammle
moodily
hinted
after
waiting
in
vain
was
going
to
remark
of
georgiana
sir
said
fledgeby
not
at
all
pleased
to
be
reminded
of
his
having
forgotten
it
she
do
seem
to
be
violent
do
seem
to
be
of
the
order
has
the
gentleness
of
the
dove
mr
fledgeby
course
you
say
so
replied
fledgeby
sharpening
the
moment
his
interest
was
touched
by
another
you
know
the
real
is
this
what
i
say
not
what
you
say
i
say
having
my
late
governor
and
my
late
mother
in
my
eye
that
georgiana
do
seem
to
be
of
the
order
the
respected
mr
lammle
was
a
bully
by
nature
and
by
usual
practice
perceiving
as
fledgeby
affronts
cumulated
that
conciliation
by
no
means
answered
the
purpose
here
he
now
directed
a
scowling
look
into
fledgeby
small
eyes
for
the
effect
of
the
opposite
treatment
satisfied
by
what
he
saw
there
he
burst
into
a
violent
passion
and
struck
his
hand
upon
the
table
making
the
china
ring
and
dance
are
a
very
offensive
fellow
sir
cried
mr
lammle
rising
are
a
highly
offensive
scoundrel
what
do
you
mean
by
this
behaviour
say
remonstrated
fledgeby
break
out
are
a
very
offensive
fellow
sir
repeated
mr
lammle
are
a
highly
offensive
scoundrel
say
you
know
urged
fledgeby
quailing
you
coarse
and
vulgar
vagabond
said
mr
lammle
looking
fiercely
about
him
your
servant
was
here
to
give
me
sixpence
of
your
money
to
get
my
boots
cleaned
afterwards
for
you
are
not
worth
the
expenditure
i
kick
you
you
would
pleaded
fledgeby
am
sure
you
think
better
of
it
tell
you
what
mr
fledgeby
said
lammle
advancing
on
him
you
presume
to
contradict
me
i
assert
myself
a
little
give
me
your
nose
fledgeby
covered
it
with
his
hand
instead
and
said
retreating
beg
you
wo
me
your
nose
sir
repeated
lammle
still
covering
that
feature
and
backing
mr
fledgeby
reiterated
apparently
with
a
severe
cold
in
his
head
beg
i
beg
you
wo
this
fellow
exclaimed
lammle
stopping
and
making
the
most
of
his
chest
fellow
presumes
on
my
having
selected
him
out
of
all
the
young
fellows
i
know
for
an
advantageous
opportunity
this
fellow
presumes
on
my
having
in
my
desk
round
the
corner
his
dirty
note
of
hand
for
a
wretched
sum
payable
on
the
occurrence
of
a
certain
event
which
event
can
only
be
of
my
and
my
wife
bringing
about
this
fellow
fledgeby
presumes
to
be
impertinent
to
me
lammle
give
me
your
nose
sir
stop
i
beg
your
pardon
said
fledgeby
with
humility
do
you
say
sir
demanded
mr
lammle
seeming
too
furious
to
understand
beg
your
pardon
repeated
fledgeby
your
words
louder
sir
the
just
indignation
of
a
gentleman
has
sent
the
blood
boiling
to
my
head
i
do
hear
you
say
repeated
fledgeby
with
laborious
explanatory
politeness
beg
your
pardon
mr
lammle
paused
a
man
of
honour
said
he
throwing
himself
into
a
chair
am
disarmed
mr
fledgeby
also
took
a
chair
though
less
demonstratively
and
by
slow
approaches
removed
his
hand
from
his
nose
some
natural
diffidence
assailed
him
as
to
blowing
it
so
shortly
after
its
having
assumed
a
personal
and
delicate
not
to
say
public
character
but
he
overcame
his
scruples
by
degrees
and
modestly
took
that
liberty
under
an
implied
protest
he
said
sneakingly
when
that
was
done
hope
we
are
friends
again
fledgeby
returned
lammle
no
more
must
have
gone
too
far
in
making
myself
disagreeable
said
fledgeby
i
never
intended
it
no
more
say
no
more
mr
lammle
repeated
in
a
magnificent
tone
me
your
fledgeby
started
they
shook
hands
and
on
mr
lammle
part
in
particular
there
ensued
great
geniality
for
he
was
quite
as
much
of
a
dastard
as
the
other
and
had
been
in
equal
danger
of
falling
into
the
second
place
for
good
when
he
took
heart
just
in
time
to
act
upon
the
information
conveyed
to
him
by
fledgeby
eye
the
breakfast
ended
in
a
perfect
understanding
incessant
machinations
were
to
be
kept
at
work
by
mr
and
mrs
lammle
love
was
to
be
made
for
fledgeby
and
conquest
was
to
be
insured
to
him
he
on
his
part
very
humbly
admitting
his
defects
as
to
the
softer
social
arts
and
entreating
to
be
backed
to
the
utmost
by
his
two
able
coadjutors
little
recked
mr
podsnap
of
the
traps
and
toils
besetting
his
young
person
he
regarded
her
as
safe
within
the
temple
of
podsnappery
hiding
the
fulness
of
time
when
she
georgiana
should
take
him
who
with
all
his
worldly
goods
should
her
endow
it
would
call
a
blush
into
the
cheek
of
his
standard
young
person
to
have
anything
to
do
with
such
matters
save
to
take
as
directed
and
with
worldly
goods
as
per
settlement
to
be
endowed
who
giveth
this
woman
to
be
married
to
this
man
i
podsnap
perish
the
daring
thought
that
any
smaller
creation
should
come
between
it
was
a
public
holiday
and
fledgeby
did
not
recover
his
spirits
or
his
usual
temperature
of
nose
until
the
afternoon
walking
into
the
city
in
the
holiday
afternoon
he
walked
against
a
living
stream
setting
out
of
it
and
thus
when
he
turned
into
the
precincts
of
st
mary
axe
he
found
a
prevalent
repose
and
quiet
there
a
yellow
overhanging
house
at
which
he
stopped
was
quiet
too
the
blinds
were
all
drawn
down
and
the
inscription
pubsey
and
seemed
to
doze
in
the
window
on
the
giving
on
the
sleepy
street
fledgeby
knocked
and
rang
and
fledgeby
rang
and
knocked
but
no
one
came
fledgeby
crossed
the
narrow
street
and
looked
up
at
the
but
nobody
looked
down
at
fledgeby
he
got
out
of
temper
crossed
the
narrow
street
again
and
pulled
the
housebell
as
if
it
were
the
house
nose
and
he
were
taking
a
hint
from
his
late
experience
his
ear
at
the
keyhole
seemed
then
at
last
to
give
him
assurance
that
something
stirred
within
his
eye
at
the
keyhole
seemed
to
confirm
his
ear
for
he
angrily
pulled
the
house
nose
again
and
pulled
and
pulled
and
continued
to
pull
until
a
human
nose
appeared
in
the
dark
doorway
you
sir
cried
fledgeby
are
nice
games
he
addressed
an
old
jewish
man
in
an
ancient
coat
long
of
skirt
and
wide
of
pocket
a
venerable
man
bald
and
shining
at
the
top
of
his
head
and
with
long
grey
hair
flowing
down
at
its
sides
and
mingling
with
his
beard
a
man
who
with
a
graceful
eastern
action
of
homage
bent
his
head
and
stretched
out
his
hands
with
the
palms
downward
as
if
to
deprecate
the
wrath
of
a
superior
have
you
been
up
to
said
fledgeby
storming
at
him
christian
master
urged
the
jewish
man
being
holiday
i
looked
for
no
one
he
blowed
said
fledgeby
entering
have
you
got
to
do
with
holidays
shut
the
door
with
his
former
action
the
old
man
obeyed
in
the
entry
hung
his
rusty
hat
as
long
out
of
date
as
his
coat
in
the
corner
near
it
stood
his
staff
no
but
a
veritable
staff
fledgeby
turned
into
the
perched
himself
on
a
business
stool
and
cocked
his
hat
there
were
light
boxes
on
shelves
in
the
and
strings
of
mock
beads
hanging
up
there
were
samples
of
cheap
clocks
and
samples
of
cheap
vases
of
flowers
foreign
toys
all
perched
on
the
stool
with
his
hat
cocked
on
his
head
and
one
of
his
legs
dangling
the
youth
of
fledgeby
hardly
contrasted
to
advantage
with
the
age
of
the
jewish
man
as
he
stood
with
his
bare
head
bowed
and
his
eyes
which
he
only
raised
in
speaking
on
the
ground
his
clothing
was
worn
down
to
the
rusty
hue
of
the
hat
in
the
entry
but
though
he
looked
shabby
he
did
not
look
mean
now
fledgeby
though
not
shabby
did
look
mean
have
not
told
me
what
you
were
up
to
you
sir
said
fledgeby
scratching
his
head
with
the
brim
of
his
hat
i
was
breathing
the
air
the
cellar
that
you
did
hear
the
my
soul
that
a
way
of
doing
business
the
old
man
represented
with
a
grave
and
patient
air
must
be
two
parties
to
the
transaction
of
business
and
the
holiday
has
left
me
alone
ca
be
buyer
and
seller
too
that
what
the
jews
say
ai
it
least
we
say
truly
if
we
say
so
answered
the
old
man
with
a
smile
people
need
speak
the
truth
sometimes
for
they
lie
enough
remarked
fascination
fledgeby
there
is
returned
the
old
man
with
quiet
emphasis
much
untruth
among
all
denominations
of
men
rather
dashed
fascination
fledgeby
took
another
scratch
at
his
intellectual
head
with
his
hat
to
gain
time
for
rallying
instance
he
resumed
as
though
it
were
he
who
had
spoken
last
but
you
and
i
ever
heard
of
a
poor
jew
jews
said
the
old
man
raising
his
eyes
from
the
ground
with
his
former
smile
hear
of
poor
jews
often
and
are
very
good
to
them
that
returned
fledgeby
know
what
i
mean
you
persuade
me
if
you
could
that
you
are
a
poor
jew
i
wish
you
confess
how
much
you
really
did
make
out
of
my
late
governor
i
should
have
a
better
opinion
of
you
the
old
man
only
bent
his
head
and
stretched
out
his
hands
as
before
go
on
posturing
like
a
deaf
and
dumb
school
said
the
ingenious
fledgeby
express
yourself
like
a
christian
or
as
nearly
as
you
can
had
had
sickness
and
misfortunes
and
was
so
poor
said
the
old
man
hopelessly
to
owe
the
father
principal
and
interest
the
son
inheriting
was
so
merciful
as
to
forgive
me
both
and
place
me
here
he
made
a
little
gesture
as
though
he
kissed
the
hem
of
an
imaginary
garment
worn
by
the
noble
youth
before
him
it
was
humbly
done
but
picturesquely
and
was
not
abasing
to
the
doer
wo
say
more
i
see
said
fledgeby
looking
at
him
as
if
he
would
like
to
try
the
effect
of
extracting
a
or
two
so
it
of
no
use
my
putting
it
to
you
but
confess
this
riah
who
believes
you
to
be
poor
now
one
said
the
old
man
you
right
assented
fledgeby
one
repeated
the
old
man
with
a
grave
slow
wave
of
his
head
scout
it
as
a
fable
were
i
to
say
this
little
fancy
business
is
not
mine
with
a
lithe
sweep
of
his
hand
around
him
to
comprehend
the
various
objects
on
the
shelves
it
is
the
little
business
of
a
christian
young
gentleman
who
places
me
his
servant
in
trust
and
charge
here
and
to
whom
i
am
accountable
for
every
single
bead
they
would
laugh
when
in
the
larger
i
tell
the
borrowers
say
old
chap
interposed
fledgeby
hope
you
mind
what
you
do
tell
i
tell
them
no
more
than
i
am
about
to
repeat
when
i
tell
them
i
can
not
promise
this
i
can
not
answer
for
the
other
i
must
see
my
principal
i
have
not
the
money
i
am
a
poor
man
and
it
does
not
rest
with
me
they
are
so
unbelieving
and
so
impatient
that
they
sometimes
curse
me
in
jehovah
name
deuced
good
that
is
said
fascination
fledgeby
at
other
times
they
say
can
it
never
be
done
without
these
tricks
mr
riah
come
come
mr
riah
we
know
the
arts
of
your
people
my
people
if
the
money
is
to
be
lent
fetch
it
fetch
it
if
it
is
not
to
be
lent
keep
it
and
say
they
never
believe
me
all
right
said
fascination
fledgeby
say
we
know
mr
riah
we
know
we
have
but
to
look
at
you
and
we
a
good
are
you
for
the
post
thought
fledgeby
a
good
was
i
to
mark
you
out
for
it
i
may
be
slow
but
i
am
precious
sure
not
a
syllable
of
this
reflection
shaped
itself
in
any
scrap
of
mr
fledgeby
breath
lest
it
should
tend
to
put
his
servant
price
up
but
looking
at
the
old
man
as
he
stood
quiet
with
his
head
bowed
and
his
eyes
cast
down
he
felt
that
to
relinquish
an
inch
of
his
baldness
an
inch
of
his
grey
hair
an
inch
of
his
an
inch
of
his
an
inch
of
his
would
be
to
relinquish
hundreds
of
pounds
here
riah
said
fledgeby
mollified
by
these
considerations
want
to
go
a
little
more
into
queer
bills
look
out
in
that
direction
it
shall
be
done
my
eye
over
the
accounts
i
find
that
branch
of
business
pays
pretty
fairly
and
i
am
game
for
extending
it
i
like
to
know
affairs
likewise
so
look
out
i
will
promptly
it
about
in
the
right
quarters
that
you
buy
queer
bills
by
the
lump
by
the
pound
weight
if
that
all
supposing
you
see
your
way
to
a
fair
chance
on
looking
over
the
parcel
and
there
one
thing
more
come
to
me
with
the
books
for
periodical
inspection
as
usual
at
eight
on
monday
morning
riah
drew
some
folding
tablets
from
his
breast
and
noted
it
down
all
i
wanted
to
say
at
the
present
time
continued
fledgeby
in
a
grudging
vein
as
he
got
off
the
stool
that
i
wish
you
take
the
air
where
you
can
hear
the
bell
or
the
knocker
either
one
of
the
two
or
both
how
do
you
take
the
air
at
the
top
of
the
house
do
you
stick
your
head
out
of
a
there
are
leads
there
and
i
have
made
a
little
garden
there
bury
your
money
in
you
old
dodger
thumbnail
space
of
garden
would
hold
the
treasure
i
bury
master
said
riah
shillings
a
week
even
when
they
are
an
old
wages
bury
themselves
should
like
to
know
what
you
really
are
worth
returned
fledgeby
with
whom
his
growing
rich
on
that
stipend
and
gratitude
was
a
very
convenient
fiction
come
let
have
a
look
at
your
garden
on
the
tiles
before
i
go
the
old
man
took
a
step
back
and
hesitated
sir
i
have
company
there
you
by
george
said
fledgeby
suppose
you
happen
to
know
whose
premises
these
are
they
are
yours
and
i
am
your
servant
in
them
i
thought
you
might
have
overlooked
that
retorted
fledgeby
with
his
eyes
on
riah
beard
as
he
felt
for
his
own
company
on
my
premises
you
know
up
and
see
the
guests
sir
i
hope
for
your
admission
that
they
can
do
no
harm
passing
him
with
a
courteous
reverence
specially
unlike
any
action
that
mr
fledgeby
could
for
his
life
have
imparted
to
his
own
head
and
hands
the
old
man
began
to
ascend
the
stairs
as
he
toiled
on
before
with
his
palm
upon
the
and
his
long
black
skirt
a
very
gaberdine
overhanging
each
successive
step
he
might
have
been
the
leader
in
some
pilgrimage
of
devotional
ascent
to
a
prophet
tomb
not
troubled
by
any
such
weak
imagining
fascination
fledgeby
merely
speculated
on
the
time
of
life
at
which
his
beard
had
begun
and
thought
once
more
what
a
good
he
was
for
the
part
some
final
wooden
steps
conducted
them
stooping
under
a
low
penthouse
roof
to
the
riah
stood
still
and
turning
to
his
master
pointed
out
his
guests
lizzie
hexam
and
jenny
wren
for
whom
perhaps
with
some
old
instinct
of
his
race
the
gentle
jew
had
spread
a
carpet
seated
on
it
against
no
more
romantic
object
than
a
blackened
over
which
some
bumble
creeper
had
been
trained
they
both
pored
over
one
book
both
with
attentive
faces
jenny
with
the
sharper
lizzie
with
the
more
perplexed
another
little
book
or
two
were
lying
near
and
a
common
basket
of
common
fruit
and
another
basket
full
of
strings
of
beads
and
tinsel
scraps
a
few
boxes
of
humble
flowers
and
evergreens
completed
the
garden
and
the
encompassing
wilderness
of
dowager
old
chimneys
twirled
their
cowls
and
fluttered
their
smoke
rather
as
if
they
were
bridling
and
fanning
themselves
and
looking
on
in
a
state
of
airy
surprise
taking
her
eyes
off
the
book
to
test
her
memory
of
something
in
it
lizzie
was
the
first
to
see
herself
observed
as
she
rose
miss
wren
likewise
became
conscious
and
said
irreverently
addressing
the
great
chief
of
the
premises
you
are
i
ca
get
up
because
my
back
bad
and
my
legs
are
queer
is
my
master
said
riah
stepping
forward
look
like
anybody
master
observed
miss
wren
to
herself
with
a
hitch
of
her
chin
and
eyes
sir
pursued
the
old
man
a
little
dressmaker
for
little
people
explain
to
the
master
jenny
that
all
said
jenny
shortly
difficult
to
fit
too
because
their
figures
are
so
uncertain
you
never
know
where
to
expect
their
waists
friend
resumed
the
old
man
motioning
towards
lizzie
as
industrious
as
virtuous
but
that
they
both
are
they
are
busy
early
and
late
sir
early
and
late
and
in
as
on
this
holiday
they
go
to
much
good
to
be
got
out
of
that
remarked
fledgeby
upon
the
person
quoth
miss
wren
snapping
him
up
made
acquaintance
with
my
guests
sir
pursued
the
jew
with
an
evident
purpose
of
drawing
out
the
dressmaker
their
coming
here
to
buy
of
our
damage
and
waste
for
miss
jenny
millinery
our
waste
goes
into
the
best
of
company
sir
on
her
little
customers
they
wear
it
in
their
hair
and
on
their
and
even
so
she
tells
me
are
presented
at
court
with
it
said
fledgeby
on
whose
intelligence
this
made
rather
strong
demands
been
buying
that
basketful
i
suppose
suppose
she
has
miss
jenny
interposed
paying
for
it
too
most
likely
have
a
look
at
it
said
the
suspicious
chief
riah
handed
it
to
him
much
for
this
now
precious
silver
shillings
said
miss
wren
riah
confirmed
her
with
two
nods
as
fledgeby
looked
to
him
a
nod
for
each
shilling
said
fledgeby
poking
into
the
contents
of
the
basket
with
his
forefinger
price
is
not
so
bad
you
have
got
good
measure
miss
jenny
suggested
that
young
lady
with
great
calmness
have
got
good
measure
miss
jenny
but
the
price
is
not
so
and
you
said
fledgeby
turning
to
the
other
visitor
you
buy
anything
here
miss
sir
sell
anything
neither
miss
sir
looking
askew
at
the
questioner
jenny
stole
her
hand
up
to
her
friend
and
drew
her
friend
down
so
that
she
bent
beside
her
on
her
knee
are
thankful
to
come
here
for
rest
sir
said
jenny
see
you
do
know
what
the
rest
of
this
place
is
to
us
does
he
lizzie
the
quiet
and
the
air
quiet
repeated
fledgeby
with
a
contemptuous
turn
of
his
head
towards
the
city
roar
the
air
with
a
at
the
smoke
said
jenny
it
so
high
and
you
see
the
clouds
rushing
on
above
the
narrow
streets
not
minding
them
and
you
see
the
golden
arrows
pointing
at
the
mountains
in
the
sky
from
which
the
wind
comes
and
you
feel
as
if
you
were
dead
the
little
creature
looked
above
her
holding
up
her
slight
transparent
hand
do
you
feel
when
you
are
dead
asked
fledgeby
much
perplexed
so
tranquil
cried
the
little
creature
smiling
so
peaceful
and
so
thankful
and
you
hear
the
people
who
are
alive
crying
and
working
and
calling
to
one
another
down
in
the
close
dark
streets
and
you
seem
to
pity
them
so
and
such
a
chain
has
fallen
from
you
and
such
a
strange
good
sorrowful
happiness
comes
upon
you
her
eyes
fell
on
the
old
man
who
with
his
hands
folded
quietly
looked
on
it
was
only
just
now
said
the
little
creature
pointing
at
him
i
fancied
i
saw
him
come
out
of
his
grave
he
toiled
out
at
that
low
door
so
bent
and
worn
and
then
he
took
his
breath
and
stood
upright
and
looked
all
round
him
at
the
sky
and
the
wind
blew
upon
him
and
his
life
down
in
the
dark
was
over
till
he
was
called
back
to
life
she
added
looking
round
at
fledgeby
with
that
lower
look
of
sharpness
did
you
call
him
back
was
long
enough
coming
anyhow
grumbled
fledgeby
you
are
not
dead
you
know
said
jenny
wren
down
to
life
mr
fledgeby
seemed
to
think
it
rather
a
good
suggestion
and
with
a
nod
turned
round
as
riah
followed
to
attend
him
down
the
stairs
the
little
creature
called
out
to
the
jew
in
a
silvery
tone
be
long
gone
come
back
and
be
dead
and
still
as
they
went
down
they
heard
the
little
sweet
voice
more
and
more
faintly
half
calling
and
half
singing
back
and
be
dead
come
back
and
be
dead
when
they
got
down
into
the
entry
fledgeby
pausing
under
the
shadow
of
the
broad
old
hat
and
mechanically
poising
the
staff
said
to
the
old
man
a
handsome
girl
that
one
in
her
senses
as
good
as
handsome
answered
riah
all
events
observed
fledgeby
with
a
dry
whistle
hope
she
ai
bad
enough
to
put
any
chap
up
to
the
fastenings
and
get
the
premises
broken
open
you
look
out
keep
your
weather
eye
awake
and
do
make
any
more
acquaintances
however
handsome
of
course
you
always
keep
my
name
to
yourself
assuredly
i
do
they
ask
it
say
it
pubsey
or
say
it
co
or
say
it
anything
you
like
but
what
it
is
his
grateful
servant
in
whose
race
gratitude
is
deep
strong
and
enduring
bowed
his
head
and
actually
did
now
put
the
hem
of
his
coat
to
his
lips
though
so
lightly
that
the
wearer
knew
nothing
of
it
thus
fascination
fledgeby
went
his
way
exulting
in
the
artful
cleverness
with
which
he
had
turned
his
thumb
down
on
a
jew
and
the
old
man
went
his
different
way
as
he
mounted
the
call
or
song
began
to
sound
in
his
ears
again
and
looking
above
he
saw
the
face
of
the
little
creature
looking
down
out
of
a
glory
of
her
long
bright
radiant
hair
and
musically
repeating
to
him
like
a
vision
up
and
be
dead
come
up
and
be
dead
chapter
a
riddle
without
an
answer
again
mr
mortimer
lightwood
and
mr
eugene
wrayburn
sat
together
in
the
temple
this
evening
however
they
were
not
together
in
the
place
of
business
of
the
eminent
solicitor
but
in
another
dismal
set
of
chambers
facing
it
on
the
same
on
whose
black
appeared
the
legend
private
mr
eugene
wrayburn
mr
mortimer
lightwood
mr
lightwood
offices
opposite
appearances
indicated
that
this
establishment
was
a
very
recent
institution
the
white
letters
of
the
inscription
were
extremely
white
and
extremely
strong
to
the
sense
of
smell
the
complexion
of
the
tables
and
chairs
was
like
lady
tippins
a
little
too
blooming
to
be
believed
in
and
the
carpets
and
floorcloth
seemed
to
rush
at
the
beholder
face
in
the
unusual
prominency
of
their
patterns
but
the
temple
accustomed
to
tone
down
both
the
still
life
and
the
human
life
that
has
much
to
do
with
it
would
soon
get
the
better
of
all
that
said
eugene
on
one
side
of
the
fire
feel
tolerably
comfortable
i
hope
the
upholsterer
may
do
the
same
should
he
asked
lightwood
from
the
other
side
of
the
fire
be
sure
pursued
eugene
reflecting
is
not
in
the
secret
of
our
pecuniary
affairs
so
perhaps
he
may
be
in
an
easy
frame
of
mind
shall
pay
him
said
mortimer
we
really
returned
eugene
indolently
surprised
say
so
mean
to
pay
him
eugene
for
my
part
said
mortimer
in
a
slightly
injured
tone
i
mean
to
pay
him
too
retorted
eugene
then
i
mean
so
much
that
i
that
i
do
mean
mean
much
that
i
only
mean
and
shall
always
only
mean
and
nothing
more
my
dear
mortimer
it
the
same
thing
his
friend
lying
back
in
his
easy
chair
watched
him
lying
back
in
his
easy
chair
as
he
stretched
out
his
legs
on
the
and
said
with
the
amused
look
that
eugene
wrayburn
could
always
awaken
in
him
without
seeming
to
try
or
care
your
vagaries
have
increased
the
bill
the
domestic
virtues
vagaries
exclaimed
eugene
raising
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
very
complete
little
kitchen
of
ours
said
mortimer
which
nothing
will
ever
be
cooked
dear
dear
mortimer
returned
his
friend
lazily
lifting
his
head
a
little
to
look
at
him
often
have
i
pointed
out
to
you
that
its
moral
influence
is
the
important
thing
moral
influence
on
this
fellow
exclaimed
lightwood
laughing
me
the
favour
said
eugene
getting
out
of
his
chair
with
much
gravity
come
and
inspect
that
feature
of
our
establishment
which
you
rashly
disparage
with
that
taking
up
a
candle
he
conducted
his
chum
into
the
fourth
room
of
the
set
of
chambers
a
little
narrow
room
which
was
very
completely
and
neatly
fitted
as
a
kitchen
said
eugene
shelf
of
brown
jars
dresser
elegantly
furnished
with
crockery
saucepans
and
pans
roasting
jack
a
charming
kettle
an
armoury
of
the
moral
influence
of
these
objects
in
forming
the
domestic
virtues
may
have
an
immense
influence
upon
me
not
upon
you
for
you
are
a
hopeless
case
but
upon
me
in
fact
i
have
an
idea
that
i
feel
the
domestic
virtues
already
forming
do
me
the
favour
to
step
into
my
bedroom
secretaire
you
see
and
abstruse
set
of
solid
mahogany
one
for
every
letter
of
the
alphabet
to
what
use
do
i
devote
them
i
receive
a
bill
say
from
jones
i
docket
it
neatly
at
the
secretaire
jones
and
i
put
it
into
pigeonhole
j
it
the
next
thing
to
a
receipt
and
is
quite
as
satisfactory
to
me
and
i
very
much
wish
mortimer
sitting
on
his
bed
with
the
air
of
a
philosopher
lecturing
a
disciple
my
example
might
induce
you
to
cultivate
habits
of
punctuality
and
method
and
by
means
of
the
moral
influences
with
which
i
have
surrounded
you
to
encourage
the
formation
of
the
domestic
virtues
mortimer
laughed
again
with
his
usual
commentaries
of
can
you
be
so
ridiculous
eugene
and
an
absurd
fellow
you
are
but
when
his
laugh
was
out
there
was
something
serious
if
not
anxious
in
his
face
despite
that
pernicious
assumption
of
lassitude
and
indifference
which
had
become
his
second
nature
he
was
strongly
attached
to
his
friend
he
had
founded
himself
upon
eugene
when
they
were
yet
boys
at
school
and
at
this
hour
imitated
him
no
less
admired
him
no
less
loved
him
no
less
than
in
those
departed
days
said
he
i
could
find
you
in
earnest
for
a
minute
i
would
try
to
say
an
earnest
word
to
you
earnest
word
repeated
eugene
moral
influences
are
beginning
to
work
say
on
i
will
returned
the
other
you
are
not
earnest
yet
this
desire
for
earnestness
murmured
eugene
with
the
air
of
one
who
was
meditating
deeply
trace
the
happy
influences
of
the
little
and
the
gratifying
resumed
mortimer
disregarding
the
light
interruption
and
laying
a
hand
upon
eugene
shoulder
as
he
mortimer
stood
before
him
seated
on
his
bed
are
withholding
something
from
me
eugene
looked
at
him
but
said
nothing
this
past
summer
you
have
been
withholding
something
from
me
before
we
entered
on
our
boating
vacation
you
were
as
bent
upon
it
as
i
have
seen
you
upon
anything
since
we
first
rowed
together
but
you
cared
very
little
for
it
when
it
came
often
found
it
a
tie
and
a
drag
upon
you
and
were
constantly
away
now
it
was
well
enough
times
a
dozen
times
twenty
times
to
say
to
me
in
your
own
odd
manner
which
i
know
so
well
and
like
so
much
that
your
disappearances
were
precautions
against
our
boring
one
another
but
of
course
after
a
short
while
i
began
to
know
that
they
covered
something
i
do
ask
what
it
is
as
you
have
not
told
me
but
the
fact
is
so
say
is
it
not
give
you
my
word
of
honour
mortimer
returned
eugene
after
a
serious
pause
of
a
few
moments
i
do
know
know
eugene
my
soul
do
know
i
know
less
about
myself
than
about
most
people
in
the
world
and
i
do
know
have
some
design
in
your
mind
i
i
do
think
i
have
any
rate
you
have
some
subject
of
interest
there
which
used
not
to
be
there
really
ca
say
replied
eugene
shaking
his
head
blankly
after
pausing
again
to
reconsider
times
i
have
thought
yes
at
other
times
i
have
thought
no
now
i
have
been
inclined
to
pursue
such
a
subject
now
i
have
felt
that
it
was
absurd
and
that
it
tired
and
embarrassed
me
absolutely
i
ca
say
frankly
and
faithfully
i
would
if
i
could
so
replying
he
clapped
a
hand
in
his
turn
on
his
friend
shoulder
as
he
rose
from
his
seat
upon
the
bed
and
said
must
take
your
friend
as
he
is
you
know
what
i
am
my
dear
mortimer
you
know
how
dreadfully
susceptible
i
am
to
boredom
you
know
that
when
i
became
enough
of
a
man
to
find
myself
an
embodied
conundrum
i
bored
myself
to
the
last
degree
by
trying
to
find
out
what
i
meant
you
know
that
at
length
i
gave
it
up
and
declined
to
guess
any
more
then
how
can
i
possibly
give
you
the
answer
that
i
have
not
discovered
the
old
nursery
form
runs
you
tell
me
what
this
may
be
my
reply
runs
no
upon
my
life
i
so
much
of
what
was
fantastically
true
to
his
own
knowledge
of
this
utterly
careless
eugene
mingled
with
the
answer
that
mortimer
could
not
receive
it
as
a
mere
evasion
besides
it
was
given
with
an
engaging
air
of
openness
and
of
special
exemption
of
the
one
friend
he
valued
from
his
reckless
indifference
dear
boy
said
eugene
us
try
the
effect
of
smoking
if
it
enlightens
me
at
all
on
this
question
i
will
impart
unreservedly
they
returned
to
the
room
they
had
come
from
and
finding
it
heated
opened
a
window
having
lighted
their
cigars
they
leaned
out
of
this
window
smoking
and
looking
down
at
the
moonlight
as
it
shone
into
the
court
below
enlightenment
resumed
eugene
after
certain
minutes
of
silence
feel
sincerely
apologetic
my
dear
mortimer
but
nothing
comes
nothing
comes
returned
mortimer
can
come
from
it
so
i
shall
hope
that
this
may
hold
good
throughout
and
that
there
may
be
nothing
on
foot
nothing
injurious
to
you
eugene
or
eugene
stayed
him
for
a
moment
with
his
hand
on
his
arm
while
he
took
a
piece
of
earth
from
an
old
flowerpot
on
the
and
dexterously
shot
it
at
a
little
point
of
light
opposite
having
done
which
to
his
satisfaction
he
said
injurious
to
any
one
else
said
eugene
taking
another
little
piece
of
earth
and
shooting
it
with
great
precision
at
the
former
mark
injurious
to
any
one
else
do
know
said
eugene
taking
as
he
said
the
word
another
shot
whom
else
do
know
checking
himself
with
another
piece
of
earth
in
his
hand
eugene
looked
at
his
friend
inquiringly
and
a
little
suspiciously
there
was
no
concealed
or
meaning
in
his
face
belated
wanderers
in
the
mazes
of
the
law
said
eugene
attracted
by
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
glancing
down
as
he
spoke
into
the
court
they
examine
the
of
number
one
seeking
the
name
they
want
not
finding
it
at
number
one
they
come
to
number
two
on
the
hat
of
wanderer
number
two
the
shorter
one
i
drop
this
pellet
hitting
him
on
the
hat
i
smoke
serenely
and
become
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
the
sky
both
the
wanderers
looked
up
towards
the
window
but
after
interchanging
a
mutter
or
two
soon
applied
themselves
to
the
below
there
they
seemed
to
discover
what
they
wanted
for
they
disappeared
from
view
by
entering
at
the
doorway
they
emerge
said
eugene
shall
see
me
bring
them
both
down
and
so
prepared
two
pellets
for
the
purpose
he
had
not
reckoned
on
their
seeking
his
name
or
lightwood
but
either
the
one
or
the
other
would
seem
to
be
in
question
for
now
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
am
on
duty
said
mortimer
you
where
you
are
eugene
requiring
no
persuasion
he
stayed
there
smoking
quietly
and
not
at
all
curious
to
know
who
knocked
until
mortimer
spoke
to
him
from
within
the
room
and
touched
him
then
drawing
in
his
head
he
found
the
visitors
to
be
young
charley
hexam
and
the
schoolmaster
both
standing
facing
him
and
both
recognized
at
a
glance
recollect
this
young
fellow
eugene
said
mortimer
me
look
at
him
returned
wrayburn
coolly
yes
yes
i
recollect
him
he
had
not
been
about
to
repeat
that
former
action
of
taking
him
by
the
chin
but
the
boy
had
suspected
him
of
it
and
had
thrown
up
his
arm
with
an
angry
start
laughingly
wrayburn
looked
to
lightwood
for
an
explanation
of
this
odd
visit
says
he
has
something
to
say
it
must
be
to
you
mortimer
i
thought
but
he
says
no
he
says
it
is
to
you
i
do
say
so
interposed
the
boy
i
mean
to
say
what
i
want
to
say
too
mr
eugene
wrayburn
passing
him
with
his
eyes
as
if
there
were
nothing
where
he
stood
eugene
looked
on
to
bradley
headstone
with
consummate
indolence
he
turned
to
mortimer
inquiring
who
may
this
other
person
be
am
charles
hexam
friend
said
bradley
am
charles
schoolmaster
good
sir
you
should
teach
your
pupils
better
manners
returned
eugene
composedly
smoking
he
leaned
an
elbow
on
the
chimneypiece
at
the
side
of
the
fire
and
looked
at
the
schoolmaster
it
was
a
cruel
look
in
its
cold
disdain
of
him
as
a
creature
of
no
worth
the
schoolmaster
looked
at
him
and
that
too
was
a
cruel
look
though
of
the
different
kind
that
it
had
a
raging
jealousy
and
fiery
wrath
in
it
very
remarkably
neither
eugene
wrayburn
nor
bradley
headstone
looked
at
all
at
the
boy
through
the
ensuing
dialogue
those
two
no
matter
who
spoke
or
whom
was
addressed
looked
at
each
other
there
was
some
secret
sure
perception
between
them
which
set
them
against
one
another
in
all
ways
some
high
respects
mr
eugene
wrayburn
said
bradley
answering
him
with
pale
and
quivering
lips
natural
feelings
of
my
pupils
are
stronger
than
my
teaching
most
respects
i
dare
say
replied
eugene
enjoying
his
cigar
whether
high
or
low
is
of
no
importance
you
have
my
name
very
correctly
pray
what
is
yours
can
not
concern
you
much
to
know
but
interposed
eugene
striking
sharply
and
cutting
him
short
at
his
mistake
does
not
concern
me
at
all
to
know
i
can
say
schoolmaster
which
is
a
most
respectable
title
you
are
right
schoolmaster
it
was
not
the
dullest
part
of
this
goad
in
its
galling
of
bradley
headstone
that
he
had
made
it
himself
in
a
moment
of
incautious
anger
he
tried
to
set
his
lips
so
as
to
prevent
their
quivering
but
they
quivered
fast
eugene
wrayburn
said
the
boy
want
a
word
with
you
i
have
wanted
it
so
much
that
we
have
looked
out
your
address
in
the
book
and
we
have
been
to
your
office
and
we
have
come
from
your
office
here
have
given
yourself
much
trouble
schoolmaster
observed
eugene
blowing
the
feathery
ash
from
his
cigar
hope
it
may
prove
remunerative
i
am
glad
to
speak
pursued
the
boy
presence
of
mr
lightwood
because
it
was
through
mr
lightwood
that
you
ever
saw
my
sister
for
a
mere
moment
wrayburn
turned
his
eyes
aside
from
the
schoolmaster
to
note
the
effect
of
the
last
word
on
mortimer
who
standing
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
as
soon
as
the
word
was
spoken
turned
his
face
towards
the
fire
and
looked
down
into
it
it
was
through
mr
lightwood
that
you
ever
saw
her
again
for
you
were
with
him
on
the
night
when
my
father
was
found
and
so
i
found
you
with
her
on
the
next
day
since
then
you
have
seen
my
sister
often
you
have
seen
my
sister
oftener
and
oftener
and
i
want
to
know
why
this
worth
while
schoolmaster
murmured
eugene
with
the
air
of
a
disinterested
adviser
much
trouble
for
nothing
you
should
know
best
but
i
think
not
do
know
mr
wrayburn
answered
bradley
with
his
passion
rising
you
address
me
you
said
eugene
i
wo
he
said
it
so
tauntingly
in
his
perfect
placidity
that
the
respectable
clutching
the
respectable
of
the
respectable
watch
could
have
wound
it
round
his
throat
and
strangled
him
with
it
not
another
word
did
eugene
deem
it
worth
while
to
utter
but
stood
leaning
his
head
upon
his
hand
smoking
and
looking
imperturbably
at
the
chafing
bradley
headstone
with
his
clutching
until
bradley
was
wellnigh
mad
wrayburn
proceeded
the
boy
not
only
know
this
that
i
have
charged
upon
you
but
we
know
more
it
has
not
yet
come
to
my
knowledge
that
we
have
found
it
out
but
we
have
we
had
a
plan
mr
headstone
and
i
for
my
sister
education
and
for
its
being
advised
and
overlooked
by
mr
headstone
who
is
a
much
more
competent
authority
whatever
you
may
pretend
to
think
as
you
smoke
than
you
could
produce
if
you
tried
then
what
do
we
find
what
do
we
find
mr
lightwood
why
we
find
that
my
sister
is
already
being
taught
without
our
knowing
it
we
find
that
while
my
sister
gives
an
unwilling
and
cold
ear
to
our
schemes
for
her
advantage
i
her
brother
and
mr
headstone
the
most
competent
authority
as
his
certificates
would
easily
prove
that
could
be
produced
she
is
wilfully
and
willingly
profiting
by
other
schemes
ay
and
taking
pains
too
for
i
know
what
such
pains
are
and
so
does
mr
headstone
well
somebody
pays
for
this
is
a
thought
that
naturally
occurs
to
us
who
pays
we
apply
ourselves
to
find
out
mr
lightwood
and
we
find
that
your
friend
this
mr
eugene
wrayburn
here
pays
then
i
ask
him
what
right
has
he
to
do
it
and
what
does
he
mean
by
it
and
how
comes
he
to
be
taking
such
a
liberty
without
my
consent
when
i
am
raising
myself
in
the
scale
of
society
by
my
own
exertions
and
mr
headstone
aid
and
have
no
right
to
have
any
darkness
cast
upon
my
prospects
or
any
imputation
upon
my
respectability
through
my
sister
the
boyish
weakness
of
this
speech
combined
with
its
great
selfishness
made
it
a
poor
one
indeed
and
yet
bradley
headstone
used
to
the
little
audience
of
a
school
and
unused
to
the
larger
ways
of
men
showed
a
kind
of
exultation
in
it
i
tell
mr
eugene
wrayburn
pursued
the
boy
forced
into
the
use
of
the
third
person
by
the
hopelessness
of
addressing
him
in
the
first
i
object
to
his
having
any
acquaintance
at
all
with
my
sister
and
that
i
request
him
to
drop
it
altogether
he
is
not
to
take
it
into
his
head
that
i
am
afraid
of
my
sister
caring
for
him
as
the
boy
sneered
the
master
sneered
and
eugene
blew
off
the
feathery
ash
again
i
object
to
it
and
that
enough
i
am
more
important
to
my
sister
than
he
thinks
as
i
raise
myself
i
intend
to
raise
her
she
knows
that
and
she
has
to
look
to
me
for
her
prospects
now
i
understand
all
this
very
well
and
so
does
mr
headstone
my
sister
is
an
excellent
girl
but
she
has
some
romantic
notions
not
about
such
things
as
your
mr
eugene
wrayburns
but
about
the
death
of
my
father
and
other
matters
of
that
sort
mr
wrayburn
encourages
those
notions
to
make
himself
of
importance
and
so
she
thinks
she
ought
to
be
grateful
to
him
and
perhaps
even
likes
to
be
now
i
do
choose
her
to
be
grateful
to
him
or
to
be
grateful
to
anybody
but
me
except
mr
headstone
and
i
tell
mr
wrayburn
that
if
he
do
take
heed
of
what
i
say
it
will
be
worse
for
her
let
him
turn
that
over
in
his
memory
and
make
sure
of
it
worse
for
her
a
pause
ensued
in
which
the
schoolmaster
looked
very
awkward
i
suggest
schoolmaster
said
eugene
removing
his
cigar
from
his
lips
to
glance
at
it
you
can
now
take
your
pupil
away
mr
lightwood
added
the
boy
with
a
burning
face
under
the
flaming
aggravation
of
getting
no
sort
of
answer
or
attention
hope
you
take
notice
of
what
i
have
said
to
your
friend
and
of
what
your
friend
has
heard
me
say
word
by
word
whatever
he
pretends
to
the
contrary
you
are
bound
to
take
notice
of
it
mr
lightwood
for
as
i
have
already
mentioned
you
first
brought
your
friend
into
my
company
and
but
for
you
we
never
should
have
seen
him
lord
knows
none
of
us
ever
wanted
him
any
more
than
any
of
us
will
ever
miss
him
now
mr
headstone
as
mr
eugene
wrayburn
has
been
obliged
to
hear
what
i
had
to
say
and
could
help
himself
and
as
i
have
said
it
out
to
the
last
word
we
have
done
all
we
wanted
to
do
and
may
go
and
leave
me
a
moment
hexam
he
returned
the
boy
complying
with
an
indignant
look
and
as
much
noise
as
he
could
make
swung
out
of
the
room
and
lightwood
went
to
the
window
and
leaned
there
looking
out
think
me
of
no
more
value
than
the
dirt
under
your
feet
said
bradley
to
eugene
speaking
in
a
carefully
weighed
and
measured
tone
or
he
could
not
have
spoken
at
all
assure
you
schoolmaster
replied
eugene
do
think
about
you
not
true
returned
the
other
know
better
coarse
eugene
retorted
you
do
know
better
wrayburn
at
least
i
know
very
well
that
it
would
be
idle
to
set
myself
against
you
in
insolent
words
or
overbearing
manners
that
lad
who
has
just
gone
out
could
put
you
to
shame
in
branches
of
knowledge
in
half
an
hour
but
you
can
throw
him
aside
like
an
inferior
you
can
do
as
much
by
me
i
have
no
doubt
beforehand
remarked
eugene
i
am
more
than
a
lad
said
bradley
with
his
clutching
hand
i
will
be
heard
sir
a
schoolmaster
said
eugene
are
always
being
heard
that
ought
to
content
you
it
does
not
content
me
replied
the
other
white
with
passion
you
suppose
that
a
man
in
forming
himself
for
the
duties
i
discharge
and
in
watching
and
repressing
himself
daily
to
discharge
them
well
dismisses
a
man
nature
suppose
you
said
eugene
from
what
i
see
as
i
look
at
you
to
be
rather
too
passionate
for
a
good
schoolmaster
as
he
spoke
he
tossed
away
the
end
of
his
cigar
with
you
sir
i
admit
i
am
passionate
with
you
sir
i
respect
myself
for
being
but
i
have
not
devils
for
my
pupils
your
teachers
i
should
rather
say
replied
eugene
wrayburn
my
name
is
bradley
headstone
you
justly
said
my
good
sir
your
name
can
not
concern
me
now
what
more
more
oh
what
a
misfortune
is
mine
cried
bradley
breaking
off
to
wipe
the
starting
perspiration
from
his
face
as
he
shook
from
head
to
foot
i
can
not
so
control
myself
as
to
appear
a
stronger
creature
than
this
when
a
man
who
has
not
felt
in
all
his
life
what
i
have
felt
in
a
day
can
so
command
himself
he
said
it
in
a
very
agony
and
even
followed
it
with
an
errant
motion
of
his
hands
as
if
he
could
have
torn
himself
eugene
wrayburn
looked
on
at
him
as
if
he
found
him
beginning
to
be
rather
an
entertaining
study
wrayburn
i
desire
to
say
something
to
you
on
my
own
part
come
schoolmaster
returned
eugene
with
a
languid
approach
to
impatience
as
the
other
again
struggled
with
himself
what
you
have
to
say
and
let
me
remind
you
that
the
door
is
standing
open
and
your
young
friend
waiting
for
you
on
the
stairs
i
accompanied
that
youth
here
sir
i
did
so
with
the
purpose
of
adding
as
a
man
whom
you
should
not
be
permitted
to
put
aside
in
case
you
put
him
aside
as
a
boy
that
his
instinct
is
correct
and
right
thus
bradley
headstone
with
great
effort
and
difficulty
that
all
asked
eugene
sir
said
the
other
flushed
and
fierce
strongly
support
him
in
his
disapproval
of
your
visits
to
his
sister
and
in
his
objection
to
your
officiousness
and
worse
in
what
you
have
taken
upon
yourself
to
do
for
her
that
all
asked
eugene
sir
i
determined
to
tell
you
that
you
are
not
justified
in
these
proceedings
and
that
they
are
injurious
to
his
sister
you
her
schoolmaster
as
well
as
her
brother
or
perhaps
you
would
like
to
be
said
eugene
it
was
a
stab
that
the
blood
followed
in
its
rush
to
bradley
headstone
face
as
swiftly
as
if
it
had
been
dealt
with
a
dagger
do
you
mean
by
that
was
as
much
as
he
could
utter
natural
ambition
enough
said
eugene
coolly
be
it
from
me
to
say
otherwise
the
sister
who
is
something
too
much
upon
your
lips
perhaps
is
so
very
different
from
all
the
associations
to
which
she
had
been
used
and
from
all
the
low
obscure
people
about
her
that
it
is
a
very
natural
ambition
you
throw
my
obscurity
in
my
teeth
mr
wrayburn
can
hardly
be
for
i
know
nothing
concerning
it
schoolmaster
and
seek
to
know
nothing
reproach
me
with
my
origin
said
bradley
headstone
cast
insinuations
at
my
but
i
tell
you
sir
i
have
worked
my
way
onward
out
of
both
and
in
spite
of
both
and
have
a
right
to
be
considered
a
better
man
than
you
with
better
reasons
for
being
proud
i
can
reproach
you
with
what
is
not
within
my
knowledge
or
how
i
can
cast
stones
that
were
never
in
my
hand
is
a
problem
for
the
ingenuity
of
a
schoolmaster
to
prove
returned
eugene
that
all
sir
if
you
suppose
that
boy
really
will
be
tired
of
waiting
said
eugene
politely
you
suppose
that
boy
to
be
friendless
mr
wrayburn
you
deceive
yourself
i
am
his
friend
and
you
shall
find
me
so
you
will
find
him
on
the
stairs
remarked
eugene
may
have
promised
yourself
sir
that
you
could
do
what
you
chose
here
because
you
had
to
deal
with
a
mere
boy
inexperienced
friendless
and
unassisted
but
i
give
you
warning
that
this
mean
calculation
is
wrong
you
have
to
do
with
a
man
also
you
have
to
do
with
me
i
will
support
him
and
if
need
be
require
reparation
for
him
my
hand
and
heart
are
in
this
cause
and
are
open
to
him
quite
a
coincidence
the
door
is
open
remarked
eugene
scorn
your
shifty
evasions
and
i
scorn
you
said
the
schoolmaster
the
meanness
of
your
nature
you
revile
me
with
the
meanness
of
my
birth
i
hold
you
in
contempt
for
it
but
if
you
do
profit
by
this
visit
and
act
accordingly
you
will
find
me
as
bitterly
in
earnest
against
you
as
i
could
be
if
i
deemed
you
worth
a
second
thought
on
my
own
account
with
a
consciously
bad
grace
and
stiff
manner
as
wrayburn
looked
so
easily
and
calmly
on
he
went
out
with
these
words
and
the
heavy
door
closed
like
a
upon
his
red
and
white
heats
of
rage
curious
monomaniac
said
eugene
man
seems
to
believe
that
everybody
was
acquainted
with
his
mother
mortimer
lightwood
being
still
at
the
window
to
which
he
had
in
delicacy
withdrawn
eugene
called
to
him
and
he
fell
to
slowly
pacing
the
room
dear
fellow
said
eugene
as
he
lighted
another
cigar
fear
my
unexpected
visitors
have
been
troublesome
if
as
a
excuse
the
legal
phrase
from
a
you
would
like
to
ask
tippins
to
tea
i
pledge
myself
to
make
love
to
her
eugene
eugene
replied
mortimer
still
pacing
the
room
am
sorry
for
this
and
to
think
that
i
have
been
so
blind
blind
dear
boy
inquired
his
unmoved
friend
were
your
words
that
night
at
the
said
lightwood
stopping
was
it
that
you
asked
me
did
i
feel
like
a
dark
combination
of
traitor
and
pickpocket
when
i
thought
of
that
girl
seem
to
remember
the
expression
said
eugene
do
you
feel
when
you
think
of
her
just
now
his
friend
made
no
direct
reply
but
observed
after
a
few
whiffs
of
his
cigar
mistake
the
situation
there
is
no
better
girl
in
all
this
london
than
lizzie
hexam
there
is
no
better
among
my
people
at
home
no
better
among
your
people
what
follows
said
eugene
looking
after
him
dubiously
as
he
paced
away
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
put
me
again
upon
guessing
the
riddle
that
i
have
given
up
do
you
design
to
capture
and
desert
this
girl
dear
fellow
no
you
design
to
marry
her
dear
fellow
no
you
design
to
pursue
her
dear
fellow
i
do
design
anything
i
have
no
design
whatever
i
am
incapable
of
designs
if
i
conceived
a
design
i
should
speedily
abandon
it
exhausted
by
the
operation
eugene
eugene
dear
mortimer
not
that
tone
of
melancholy
reproach
i
entreat
what
can
i
do
more
than
tell
you
all
i
know
and
acknowledge
my
ignorance
of
all
i
do
know
how
does
that
little
old
song
go
which
under
pretence
of
being
cheerful
is
by
far
the
most
lugubrious
i
ever
heard
in
my
life
away
with
melancholy
nor
doleful
changes
ring
on
life
and
human
folly
but
merrily
merrily
sing
fal
la
do
let
us
sing
fal
la
my
dear
mortimer
which
is
comparatively
unmeaning
but
let
us
sing
that
we
give
up
guessing
the
riddle
altogether
you
in
communication
with
this
girl
eugene
and
is
what
these
people
say
true
concede
both
admissions
to
my
honourable
and
learned
friend
what
is
to
come
of
it
what
are
you
doing
where
are
you
going
dear
mortimer
one
would
think
the
schoolmaster
had
left
behind
him
a
catechizing
infection
you
are
ruffled
by
the
want
of
another
cigar
take
one
of
these
i
entreat
light
it
at
mine
which
is
in
perfect
order
so
now
do
me
the
justice
to
observe
that
i
am
doing
all
i
can
towards
and
that
you
have
a
light
thrown
on
those
household
implements
which
when
you
only
saw
them
as
in
a
glass
darkly
you
were
hastily
i
must
say
hastily
inclined
to
depreciate
sensible
of
my
deficiencies
i
have
surrounded
myself
with
moral
influences
expressly
meant
to
promote
the
formation
of
the
domestic
virtues
to
those
influences
and
to
the
improving
society
of
my
friend
from
boyhood
commend
me
with
your
best
wishes
eugene
said
lightwood
affectionately
now
standing
near
him
so
that
they
both
stood
in
one
little
cloud
of
smoke
would
that
you
answered
my
three
questions
what
is
to
come
of
it
what
are
you
doing
where
are
you
going
my
dear
mortimer
returned
eugene
lightly
fanning
away
the
smoke
with
his
hand
for
the
better
exposition
of
his
frankness
of
face
and
manner
me
i
would
answer
them
instantly
if
i
could
but
to
enable
me
to
do
so
i
must
first
have
found
out
the
troublesome
conundrum
long
abandoned
here
it
is
eugene
wrayburn
tapping
his
forehead
and
breast
perhaps
you
ca
tell
me
what
this
may
be
no
upon
my
life
i
ca
i
give
it
up
chapter
in
which
a
friendly
move
is
originated
the
arrangement
between
mr
boffin
and
his
literary
man
mr
silas
wegg
so
far
altered
with
the
altered
habits
of
mr
boffin
life
as
that
the
roman
empire
usually
declined
in
the
morning
and
in
the
eminently
aristocratic
family
mansion
rather
than
in
the
evening
as
of
yore
and
in
boffin
bower
there
were
occasions
however
when
mr
boffin
seeking
a
brief
refuge
from
the
blandishments
of
fashion
would
present
himself
at
the
bower
after
dark
to
anticipate
the
next
sallying
forth
of
wegg
and
would
there
on
the
old
settle
pursue
the
downward
fortunes
of
those
enervated
and
corrupted
masters
of
the
world
who
were
by
this
time
on
their
last
legs
if
wegg
had
been
worse
paid
for
his
office
or
better
qualified
to
discharge
it
he
would
have
considered
these
visits
complimentary
and
agreeable
but
holding
the
position
of
a
humbug
he
resented
them
this
was
quite
according
to
rule
for
the
incompetent
servant
by
whomsoever
employed
is
always
against
his
employer
even
those
born
governors
noble
and
right
honourable
creatures
who
have
been
the
most
imbecile
in
high
places
have
uniformly
shown
themselves
the
most
opposed
sometimes
in
belying
distrust
sometimes
in
vapid
insolence
to
their
employer
what
is
in
such
wise
true
of
the
public
master
and
servant
is
equally
true
of
the
private
master
and
servant
all
the
world
over
when
mr
silas
wegg
did
at
last
obtain
free
access
to
house
as
he
had
been
wont
to
call
the
mansion
outside
which
he
had
sat
shelterless
so
long
and
when
he
did
at
last
find
it
in
all
particulars
as
different
from
his
mental
plans
of
it
as
according
to
the
nature
of
things
it
well
could
be
that
and
character
by
way
of
asserting
himself
and
making
out
a
case
for
compensation
affected
to
fall
into
a
melancholy
strain
of
musing
over
the
mournful
past
as
if
the
house
and
he
had
had
a
fall
in
life
together
this
sir
silas
would
say
to
his
patron
sadly
nodding
his
head
and
musing
once
our
house
this
sir
is
the
building
from
which
i
have
so
often
seen
those
great
creatures
miss
elizabeth
master
george
aunt
jane
and
uncle
parker
whose
very
names
were
of
his
own
inventing
and
repass
and
has
it
come
to
this
indeed
ah
dear
me
dear
me
so
tender
were
his
lamentations
that
the
kindly
mr
boffin
was
quite
sorry
for
him
and
almost
felt
mistrustful
that
in
buying
the
house
he
had
done
him
an
irreparable
injury
two
or
three
diplomatic
interviews
the
result
of
great
subtlety
on
mr
wegg
part
but
assuming
the
mask
of
careless
yielding
to
a
fortuitous
combination
of
circumstances
impelling
him
towards
clerkenwell
had
enabled
him
to
complete
his
bargain
with
mr
venus
me
round
to
the
bower
said
silas
when
the
bargain
was
closed
saturday
evening
and
if
a
sociable
glass
of
old
jamaikey
warm
should
meet
your
views
i
am
not
the
man
to
begrudge
it
are
aware
of
my
being
poor
company
sir
replied
mr
venus
be
it
so
it
being
so
here
is
saturday
evening
come
and
here
is
mr
venus
come
and
ringing
at
the
mr
wegg
opens
the
gate
descries
a
sort
of
brown
paper
truncheon
under
mr
venus
arm
and
remarks
in
a
dry
tone
i
thought
perhaps
you
might
have
come
in
a
cab
mr
wegg
replies
venus
am
not
above
a
parcel
a
parcel
no
says
wegg
with
some
dissatisfaction
but
does
not
openly
growl
certain
sort
of
parcel
might
be
above
you
is
your
purchase
mr
wegg
says
venus
politely
handing
it
over
i
am
glad
to
restore
it
to
the
source
from
whence
it
flowed
says
wegg
this
affair
is
concluded
i
may
mention
to
you
in
a
friendly
way
that
i
my
doubts
whether
if
i
had
consulted
a
lawyer
you
could
have
kept
this
article
back
from
me
i
only
throw
it
out
as
a
legal
point
you
think
so
mr
wegg
i
bought
you
in
open
contract
ca
buy
human
flesh
and
blood
in
this
country
sir
not
alive
you
ca
says
wegg
shaking
his
head
query
bone
a
legal
point
asks
venus
a
legal
point
am
not
competent
to
speak
upon
that
mr
wegg
says
venus
reddening
and
growing
something
louder
upon
a
point
of
fact
i
think
myself
competent
to
speak
and
as
a
point
of
fact
i
would
have
seen
you
will
you
allow
me
to
say
further
would
say
more
than
further
if
i
was
you
mr
wegg
suggests
pacifically
i
have
given
that
packet
into
your
hand
without
being
paid
my
price
for
it
i
do
pretend
to
know
how
the
point
of
law
may
stand
but
i
thoroughly
confident
upon
the
point
of
fact
as
mr
venus
is
irritable
no
doubt
owing
to
his
disappointment
in
love
and
as
it
is
not
the
cue
of
mr
wegg
to
have
him
out
of
temper
the
latter
gentleman
soothingly
remarks
only
put
it
as
a
little
case
i
only
put
it
i
rather
mr
wegg
you
put
it
another
time
is
mr
venus
retort
i
tell
you
candidly
i
do
like
your
little
cases
arrived
by
this
time
in
mr
wegg
made
bright
on
the
chilly
evening
by
gaslight
and
fire
mr
venus
softens
and
compliments
him
on
his
abode
profiting
by
the
occasion
to
remind
wegg
that
he
venus
told
him
he
had
got
into
a
good
thing
wegg
rejoins
bear
in
mind
mr
venus
that
no
gold
without
its
alloy
mix
for
yourself
and
take
a
seat
in
the
will
you
perform
upon
a
pipe
sir
am
but
an
indifferent
performer
sir
returns
the
other
accompany
you
with
a
whiff
or
two
at
intervals
so
mr
venus
mixes
and
wegg
mixes
and
mr
venus
lights
and
puffs
and
wegg
lights
and
puffs
there
alloy
even
in
this
metal
of
yours
mr
wegg
you
was
remarking
returns
wegg
do
like
it
mr
venus
i
do
like
to
have
the
life
knocked
out
of
former
inhabitants
of
this
house
in
the
gloomy
dark
and
not
know
who
did
it
you
have
any
suspicions
mr
wegg
returns
that
gentleman
know
who
profits
by
it
but
i
no
suspicions
having
said
which
mr
wegg
smokes
and
looks
at
the
fire
with
a
most
determined
expression
of
charity
as
if
he
had
caught
that
cardinal
virtue
by
the
skirts
as
she
felt
it
her
painful
duty
to
depart
from
him
and
held
her
by
main
force
resumes
wegg
have
observations
as
i
can
offer
upon
certain
points
and
parties
but
i
make
no
objections
mr
venus
here
is
an
immense
fortune
drops
from
the
clouds
upon
a
person
that
shall
be
nameless
here
is
a
weekly
allowance
with
a
certain
weight
of
coals
drops
from
the
clouds
upon
me
which
of
us
is
the
better
man
not
the
person
that
shall
be
nameless
that
an
observation
of
mine
but
i
do
make
it
an
objection
i
take
my
allowance
and
my
certain
weight
of
coals
he
takes
his
fortune
that
the
way
it
works
would
be
a
good
thing
for
me
if
i
could
see
things
in
the
calm
light
you
do
mr
wegg
look
here
pursues
silas
with
an
oratorical
flourish
of
his
pipe
and
his
wooden
leg
the
latter
having
an
undignified
tendency
to
tilt
him
back
in
his
chair
another
observation
mr
venus
unaccompanied
with
an
objection
him
that
shall
be
nameless
is
liable
to
be
talked
over
he
gets
talked
over
him
that
shall
be
nameless
having
me
at
his
right
hand
naturally
looking
to
be
promoted
higher
and
you
may
perhaps
say
meriting
to
be
promoted
higher
mr
venus
murmurs
that
he
does
say
so
him
that
shall
be
nameless
under
such
circumstances
passes
me
by
and
puts
a
stranger
above
my
head
which
of
us
two
is
the
better
man
which
of
us
two
can
repeat
most
poetry
which
of
us
two
has
in
the
service
of
him
that
shall
be
nameless
tackled
the
romans
both
civil
and
military
till
he
has
got
as
husky
as
if
he
been
weaned
and
ever
since
brought
up
on
sawdust
not
the
stranger
yet
the
house
is
as
free
to
him
as
if
it
was
his
and
he
has
his
room
and
is
put
upon
a
footing
and
draws
about
a
thousand
a
year
i
am
banished
to
the
bower
to
be
found
in
it
like
a
piece
of
furniture
whenever
wanted
merit
therefore
do
win
that
the
way
it
works
i
observe
it
because
i
ca
help
observing
it
being
accustomed
to
take
a
powerful
sight
of
notice
but
i
do
object
ever
here
before
mr
venus
inside
the
gate
mr
wegg
been
as
far
as
the
gate
then
mr
venus
mr
wegg
and
peeped
in
from
curiosity
you
see
anything
but
the
mr
wegg
rolls
his
eyes
all
round
the
room
in
that
ever
unsatisfied
quest
of
his
and
then
rolls
his
eyes
all
round
mr
venus
as
if
suspicious
of
his
having
something
about
him
to
be
found
out
yet
sir
he
pursues
acquainted
with
old
mr
harmon
one
would
have
thought
it
might
have
been
polite
in
you
too
to
give
him
a
call
and
you
naturally
of
a
polite
disposition
you
are
this
last
clause
as
a
softening
compliment
to
mr
venus
is
true
sir
replies
venus
winking
his
weak
eyes
and
running
his
fingers
through
his
dusty
shock
of
hair
i
was
so
before
a
certain
observation
soured
me
you
understand
to
what
i
allude
mr
wegg
to
a
certain
written
statement
respecting
not
wishing
to
be
regarded
in
a
certain
light
since
that
all
is
fled
save
gall
all
says
mr
wegg
in
a
tone
of
sentimental
condolence
sir
returns
venus
the
world
may
deem
it
harsh
but
quite
as
soon
pitch
into
my
best
friend
as
not
indeed
i
sooner
involuntarily
making
a
pass
with
his
wooden
leg
to
guard
himself
as
mr
venus
springs
up
in
the
emphasis
of
this
unsociable
declaration
mr
wegg
tilts
over
on
his
back
chair
and
all
and
is
rescued
by
that
harmless
misanthrope
in
a
disjointed
state
and
ruefully
rubbing
his
head
you
lost
your
balance
mr
wegg
says
venus
handing
him
his
pipe
about
time
to
do
it
grumbles
silas
a
man
visitors
without
a
word
of
notice
conduct
themselves
with
the
sudden
wiciousness
of
do
come
flying
out
of
your
chair
like
that
mr
venus
ask
your
pardon
mr
wegg
i
am
so
soured
but
hang
it
says
wegg
argumentatively
mind
can
be
soured
sitting
and
as
to
being
regarded
in
lights
there
bumpey
lights
as
well
as
bony
in
which
again
rubbing
his
head
object
to
regard
myself
bear
it
in
memory
sir
you
be
so
good
mr
wegg
slowly
subdues
his
ironical
tone
and
his
lingering
irritation
and
resumes
his
pipe
were
talking
of
old
mr
harmon
being
a
friend
of
yours
a
friend
mr
wegg
only
known
to
speak
to
and
to
have
a
little
deal
with
now
and
then
a
very
inquisitive
character
mr
wegg
regarding
what
was
found
in
the
dust
as
inquisitive
as
secret
you
found
him
secret
returns
wegg
with
a
greedy
relish
had
always
the
look
of
it
and
the
manner
of
it
with
another
roll
of
his
eyes
to
what
was
found
in
the
dust
now
did
you
ever
hear
him
mention
how
he
found
it
my
dear
friend
living
on
the
mysterious
premises
one
would
like
to
know
for
instance
where
he
found
things
or
for
instance
how
he
set
about
it
whether
he
began
at
the
top
of
the
mounds
or
whether
he
began
at
the
bottom
whether
he
prodded
mr
wegg
pantomime
is
skilful
and
expressive
here
whether
he
scooped
should
you
say
scooped
my
dear
mr
venus
or
should
you
as
a
man
say
prodded
should
say
neither
mr
wegg
a
mr
venus
mix
again
why
neither
i
suppose
sir
that
what
was
found
was
found
in
the
sorting
and
sifting
all
the
mounds
are
sorted
and
sifted
shall
see
and
pass
your
opinion
mix
again
on
each
occasion
of
his
saying
again
mr
wegg
with
a
hop
on
his
wooden
leg
hitches
his
chair
a
little
nearer
more
as
if
he
were
proposing
that
himself
and
mr
venus
should
mix
again
than
that
they
should
replenish
their
glasses
as
i
said
before
on
the
mysterious
premises
says
wegg
when
the
other
has
acted
on
his
hospitable
entreaty
likes
to
know
would
you
be
inclined
to
say
now
as
a
brother
that
he
ever
hid
things
in
the
dust
as
well
as
found
wegg
on
the
whole
i
should
say
he
might
mr
wegg
claps
on
his
spectacles
and
admiringly
surveys
mr
venus
from
head
to
foot
a
mortal
equally
with
myself
whose
hand
i
take
in
mine
for
the
first
time
this
day
having
unaccountably
overlooked
that
act
so
full
of
boundless
confidence
binding
a
to
a
fellow
creetur
says
wegg
holding
mr
venus
palm
out
flat
and
ready
for
smiting
and
now
smiting
it
such
and
no
other
for
i
scorn
all
lowlier
ties
betwixt
myself
and
the
man
walking
with
his
face
erect
that
alone
i
call
my
twin
regarded
and
regarding
in
this
trustful
bond
what
do
you
think
he
might
have
hid
is
but
a
supposition
mr
wegg
a
being
with
his
hand
upon
his
heart
cries
wegg
and
the
apostrophe
is
not
the
less
impressive
for
the
being
hand
being
actually
upon
his
rum
and
water
your
supposition
into
language
and
bring
it
out
mr
venus
was
the
species
of
old
gentleman
sir
slowly
returns
that
practical
anatomist
after
drinking
i
should
judge
likely
to
take
such
opportunities
as
this
place
offered
of
stowing
away
money
valuables
maybe
papers
one
that
was
ever
an
ornament
to
human
life
says
mr
wegg
again
holding
out
mr
venus
palm
as
if
he
were
going
to
tell
his
fortune
by
chiromancy
and
holding
his
own
up
ready
for
smiting
it
when
the
time
should
come
one
that
the
poet
might
have
had
his
eye
on
in
writing
the
national
naval
words
helm
now
lay
her
close
yard
arm
and
yard
arm
she
lies
again
cried
i
mr
venus
give
her
dose
man
shrouds
and
grapple
sir
or
she
flies
that
is
to
say
regarded
in
the
light
of
true
british
oak
for
such
you
are
explain
mr
venus
the
expression
papers
that
the
old
gentleman
was
generally
cutting
off
some
near
relation
or
blocking
out
some
natural
affection
mr
venus
rejoins
most
likely
made
a
good
many
wills
and
codicils
the
palm
of
silas
wegg
descends
with
a
sounding
smack
upon
the
palm
of
venus
and
wegg
lavishly
exclaims
in
opinion
equally
with
feeling
mix
a
little
more
having
now
hitched
his
wooden
leg
and
his
chair
close
in
front
of
mr
venus
mr
wegg
rapidly
mixes
for
both
gives
his
visitor
his
glass
touches
its
rim
with
the
rim
of
his
own
puts
his
own
to
his
lips
puts
it
down
and
spreading
his
hands
on
his
visitor
knees
thus
addresses
him
venus
it
ai
that
i
object
to
being
passed
over
for
a
stranger
though
i
regard
the
stranger
as
a
more
than
doubtful
customer
it
for
the
sake
of
making
money
though
money
is
ever
welcome
it
ai
for
myself
though
i
am
not
so
haughty
as
to
be
above
doing
myself
a
good
turn
it
for
the
cause
of
the
right
mr
venus
passively
winking
his
weak
eyes
both
at
once
demands
is
mr
wegg
friendly
move
sir
that
i
now
propose
you
see
the
move
sir
you
have
pointed
it
out
mr
wegg
i
ca
say
whether
i
do
or
not
there
is
anything
to
be
found
on
these
premises
let
us
find
it
together
let
us
make
the
friendly
move
of
agreeing
to
look
for
it
together
let
us
make
the
friendly
move
of
agreeing
to
share
the
profits
of
it
equally
betwixt
us
in
the
cause
of
the
right
thus
silas
assuming
a
noble
air
says
mr
venus
looking
up
after
meditating
with
his
hair
held
in
his
hands
as
if
he
could
only
fix
his
attention
by
fixing
his
head
anything
was
to
be
unburied
from
under
the
dust
it
would
be
kept
a
secret
by
you
and
me
would
that
be
it
mr
wegg
would
depend
upon
what
it
was
mr
venus
say
it
was
money
or
plate
or
jewellery
it
would
be
as
much
ours
as
anybody
else
mr
venus
rubs
an
eyebrow
interrogatively
the
cause
of
the
right
it
would
because
it
would
be
unknowingly
sold
with
the
mounds
else
and
the
buyer
would
get
what
he
was
never
meant
to
have
and
never
bought
and
what
would
that
be
mr
venus
but
the
cause
of
the
wrong
it
was
papers
mr
venus
propounds
to
what
they
contained
we
should
offer
to
dispose
of
to
the
parties
most
interested
replies
wegg
promptly
the
cause
of
the
right
mr
wegg
so
mr
venus
if
the
parties
should
use
them
in
the
cause
of
the
wrong
that
would
be
their
act
and
deed
mr
venus
i
have
an
opinion
of
you
sir
to
which
it
is
not
easy
to
give
mouth
since
i
called
upon
you
that
evening
when
you
were
as
i
may
say
floating
your
powerful
mind
in
tea
i
have
felt
that
you
required
to
be
roused
with
an
object
in
this
friendly
move
sir
you
will
have
a
glorious
object
to
rouse
you
mr
wegg
then
goes
on
to
enlarge
upon
what
throughout
has
been
uppermost
in
his
crafty
mind
the
qualifications
of
mr
venus
for
such
a
search
he
expatiates
on
mr
venus
patient
habits
and
delicate
manipulation
on
his
skill
in
piecing
little
things
together
on
his
knowledge
of
various
tissues
and
textures
on
the
likelihood
of
small
indications
leading
him
on
to
the
discovery
of
great
concealments
as
to
myself
says
wegg
am
not
good
at
it
whether
i
gave
myself
up
to
prodding
or
whether
i
gave
myself
up
to
scooping
i
could
do
it
with
that
delicate
touch
so
as
not
to
show
that
i
was
disturbing
the
mounds
quite
different
with
you
going
to
work
as
you
would
in
the
light
of
a
holily
pledged
in
a
friendly
move
to
his
brother
man
mr
wegg
next
modestly
remarks
on
the
want
of
adaptation
in
a
wooden
leg
to
ladders
and
such
like
airy
perches
and
also
hints
at
an
inherent
tendency
in
that
timber
fiction
when
called
into
action
for
the
purposes
of
a
promenade
on
an
ashey
slope
to
stick
itself
into
the
yielding
foothold
and
peg
its
owner
to
one
spot
then
leaving
this
part
of
the
subject
he
remarks
on
the
special
phenomenon
that
before
his
installation
in
the
bower
it
was
from
mr
venus
that
he
first
heard
of
the
legend
of
hidden
wealth
in
the
mounds
he
observes
with
a
vaguely
pious
air
surely
never
meant
for
nothing
lastly
he
returns
to
the
cause
of
the
right
gloomily
foreshadowing
the
possibility
of
something
being
unearthed
to
criminate
mr
boffin
of
whom
he
once
more
candidly
admits
it
can
not
be
denied
that
he
profits
by
a
murder
and
anticipating
his
denunciation
by
the
friendly
movers
to
avenging
justice
and
this
mr
wegg
expressly
points
out
not
at
all
for
the
sake
of
the
reward
though
it
would
be
a
want
of
principle
not
to
take
it
to
all
this
mr
venus
with
his
shock
of
dusty
hair
cocked
after
the
manner
of
a
terrier
ears
attends
profoundly
when
mr
wegg
having
finished
opens
his
arms
wide
as
if
to
show
mr
venus
how
bare
his
breast
is
and
then
folds
them
pending
a
reply
mr
venus
winks
at
him
with
both
eyes
some
little
time
before
speaking
see
you
have
tried
it
by
yourself
mr
wegg
he
says
when
he
does
speak
have
found
out
the
difficulties
by
experience
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
i
have
tried
it
replies
wegg
a
little
dashed
by
the
hint
have
just
skimmed
it
skimmed
it
found
nothing
besides
the
difficulties
wegg
shakes
his
head
scarcely
know
what
to
say
to
this
mr
wegg
observes
venus
after
ruminating
for
a
while
yes
wegg
naturally
urges
i
was
soured
my
answer
would
be
no
but
being
soured
mr
wegg
and
driven
to
reckless
madness
and
desperation
i
suppose
it
yes
wegg
joyfully
reproduces
the
two
glasses
repeats
the
ceremony
of
clinking
their
rims
and
inwardly
drinks
with
great
heartiness
to
the
health
and
success
in
life
of
the
young
lady
who
has
reduced
mr
venus
to
his
present
convenient
state
of
mind
the
articles
of
the
friendly
move
are
then
severally
recited
and
agreed
upon
they
are
but
secrecy
fidelity
and
perseverance
the
bower
to
be
always
free
of
access
to
mr
venus
for
his
researches
and
every
precaution
to
be
taken
against
their
attracting
observation
in
the
neighbourhood
a
footstep
exclaims
venus
cries
wegg
starting
st
they
are
in
the
act
of
ratifying
the
treaty
of
friendly
move
by
shaking
hands
upon
it
they
softly
break
off
light
their
pipes
which
have
gone
out
and
lean
back
in
their
chairs
no
doubt
a
footstep
it
approaches
the
window
and
a
hand
taps
at
the
glass
in
calls
wegg
meaning
come
round
by
the
door
but
the
heavy
sash
is
slowly
raised
and
a
head
slowly
looks
in
out
of
the
dark
background
of
night
is
mr
silas
wegg
here
oh
i
see
him
the
friendly
movers
might
not
have
been
quite
at
their
ease
even
though
the
visitor
had
entered
in
the
usual
manner
but
leaning
on
the
window
and
staring
in
out
of
the
darkness
they
find
the
visitor
extremely
embarrassing
especially
mr
venus
who
removes
his
pipe
draws
back
his
head
and
stares
at
the
starer
as
if
it
were
his
own
hindoo
baby
come
to
fetch
him
home
evening
mr
wegg
the
yard
should
be
looked
to
if
you
please
it
do
catch
it
mr
rokesmith
falters
wegg
is
mr
rokesmith
do
let
me
disturb
you
i
am
not
coming
in
i
have
only
a
message
for
you
which
i
undertook
to
deliver
on
my
way
home
to
my
lodgings
i
was
in
two
minds
about
coming
beyond
the
gate
without
ringing
not
knowing
but
you
might
have
a
dog
about
wish
i
had
mutters
wegg
with
his
back
turned
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
st
hush
the
stranger
mr
venus
that
any
one
i
know
inquires
the
staring
secretary
mr
rokesmith
friend
of
mine
passing
the
evening
with
me
i
beg
his
pardon
mr
boffin
wishes
you
to
know
that
he
does
not
expect
you
to
stay
at
home
any
evening
on
the
chance
of
his
coming
it
has
occurred
to
him
that
he
may
without
intending
it
have
been
a
tie
upon
you
in
future
if
he
should
come
without
notice
he
will
take
his
chance
of
finding
you
and
it
will
be
all
the
same
to
him
if
he
does
not
i
undertook
to
tell
you
on
my
way
that
all
with
that
and
night
the
secretary
lowers
the
window
and
disappears
they
listen
and
hear
his
footsteps
go
back
to
the
gate
and
hear
the
gate
close
after
him
for
that
individual
mr
venus
remarks
wegg
when
he
is
fully
gone
have
been
passed
over
let
me
ask
you
what
you
think
of
him
apparently
mr
venus
does
not
know
what
to
think
of
him
for
he
makes
sundry
efforts
to
reply
without
delivering
himself
of
any
other
articulate
utterance
than
that
he
has
singular
look
double
look
you
mean
sir
rejoins
wegg
playing
bitterly
upon
the
word
his
look
any
amount
of
singular
look
for
me
but
not
a
double
look
that
an
mind
sir
you
say
there
something
against
him
venus
asks
against
him
repeats
wegg
what
would
the
relief
be
to
my
feelings
as
a
if
i
was
the
slave
of
truth
and
did
feel
myself
compelled
to
answer
everything
see
into
what
wonderful
maudlin
refuges
featherless
ostriches
plunge
their
heads
it
is
such
unspeakable
moral
compensation
to
wegg
to
be
overcome
by
the
consideration
that
mr
rokesmith
has
an
underhanded
mind
this
starlight
night
mr
venus
he
remarks
when
he
is
showing
that
friendly
mover
out
across
the
yard
and
both
are
something
the
worse
for
mixing
again
and
again
this
starlight
night
to
think
that
strangers
and
underhanded
minds
can
go
walking
home
under
the
sky
as
if
they
was
all
square
spectacle
of
those
orbs
says
mr
venus
gazing
upward
with
his
hat
tumbling
off
heavy
on
me
her
crushing
words
that
she
did
not
wish
to
regard
herself
nor
yet
to
be
regarded
in
that
know
i
know
you
need
repeat
says
wegg
pressing
his
hand
think
how
those
stars
steady
me
in
the
cause
of
the
right
against
some
that
shall
be
nameless
it
is
that
i
bear
malice
but
see
how
they
glisten
with
old
remembrances
old
remembrances
of
what
sir
mr
venus
begins
drearily
replying
her
words
in
her
own
handwriting
that
she
does
not
wish
to
regard
herself
nor
yet
when
silas
cuts
him
short
with
dignity
sir
remembrances
of
our
house
of
master
george
of
aunt
jane
of
uncle
parker
all
laid
waste
all
offered
up
sacrifices
to
the
minion
of
fortune
and
the
worm
of
the
hour
chapter
in
which
an
innocent
elopement
occurs
the
minion
of
fortune
and
the
worm
of
the
hour
or
in
less
cutting
language
nicodemus
boffin
esquire
the
golden
dustman
had
become
as
much
at
home
in
his
eminently
aristocratic
family
mansion
as
he
was
likely
ever
to
be
he
could
not
but
feel
that
like
an
eminently
aristocratic
family
cheese
it
was
much
too
large
for
his
wants
and
bred
an
infinite
amount
of
parasites
but
he
was
content
to
regard
this
drawback
on
his
property
as
a
sort
of
perpetual
legacy
duty
he
felt
the
more
resigned
to
it
forasmuch
as
mrs
boffin
enjoyed
herself
completely
and
miss
bella
was
delighted
that
young
lady
was
no
doubt
an
acquisition
to
the
boffins
she
was
far
too
pretty
to
be
unattractive
anywhere
and
far
too
quick
of
perception
to
be
below
the
tone
of
her
new
career
whether
it
improved
her
heart
might
be
a
matter
of
taste
that
was
open
to
question
but
as
touching
another
matter
of
taste
its
improvement
of
her
appearance
and
manner
there
could
be
no
question
whatever
and
thus
it
soon
came
about
that
miss
bella
began
to
set
mrs
boffin
right
and
even
further
that
miss
bella
began
to
feel
ill
at
ease
and
as
it
were
responsible
when
she
saw
mrs
boffin
going
wrong
not
that
so
sweet
a
disposition
and
so
sound
a
nature
could
ever
go
very
wrong
even
among
the
great
visiting
authorities
who
agreed
that
the
boffins
were
vulgar
which
for
certain
was
not
their
own
case
in
saying
so
but
that
when
she
made
a
slip
on
the
social
ice
on
which
all
the
children
of
podsnappery
with
genteel
souls
to
be
saved
are
required
to
skate
in
circles
or
to
slide
in
long
rows
she
inevitably
tripped
miss
bella
up
so
that
young
lady
felt
and
caused
her
to
experience
great
confusion
under
the
glances
of
the
more
skilful
performers
engaged
in
those
at
miss
bella
time
of
life
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
she
should
examine
herself
very
closely
on
the
congruity
or
stability
of
her
position
in
mr
boffin
house
and
as
she
had
never
been
sparing
of
complaints
of
her
old
home
when
she
had
no
other
to
compare
it
with
so
there
was
no
novelty
of
ingratitude
or
disdain
in
her
very
much
preferring
her
new
one
invaluable
man
is
rokesmith
said
mr
boffin
after
some
two
or
three
months
i
ca
quite
make
him
out
neither
could
bella
so
she
found
the
subject
rather
interesting
takes
more
care
of
my
affairs
morning
noon
and
night
said
mr
boffin
fifty
other
men
put
together
either
could
or
would
and
yet
he
has
ways
of
his
own
that
are
like
tying
a
right
across
the
road
and
bringing
me
up
short
when
i
am
almost
arm
in
arm
with
him
i
ask
how
so
sir
inquired
bella
my
dear
said
mr
boffin
wo
meet
any
company
here
but
you
when
we
have
visitors
i
should
wish
him
to
have
his
regular
place
at
the
table
like
ourselves
but
no
he
wo
take
it
he
considers
himself
above
it
said
miss
bella
with
an
airy
toss
of
her
head
should
leave
him
alone
ai
that
my
dear
replied
mr
boffin
thinking
it
over
consider
himself
above
it
he
considers
himself
beneath
it
suggested
bella
so
he
ought
to
know
best
my
dear
nor
it
ai
that
neither
no
repeated
mr
boffin
with
a
shake
of
his
head
after
again
thinking
it
over
a
modest
man
but
he
do
consider
himself
beneath
it
what
does
he
consider
sir
asked
bella
if
i
know
said
mr
boffin
seemed
at
first
as
if
it
was
only
lightwood
that
he
objected
to
meet
and
now
it
seems
to
be
everybody
except
you
oho
thought
miss
bella
deed
that
it
is
it
for
mr
mortimer
lightwood
had
dined
there
two
or
three
times
and
she
had
met
him
elsewhere
and
he
had
shown
her
some
attention
cool
in
a
secretary
and
pa
lodger
to
make
me
the
subject
of
his
jealousy
that
pa
daughter
should
be
so
contemptuous
of
pa
lodger
was
odd
but
there
were
odder
anomalies
than
that
in
the
mind
of
the
spoilt
girl
spoilt
first
by
poverty
and
then
by
wealth
be
it
this
history
part
however
to
leave
them
to
unravel
themselves
little
too
much
i
think
miss
bella
reflected
scornfully
have
pa
lodger
laying
claim
to
me
and
keeping
eligible
people
off
a
little
too
much
indeed
to
have
the
opportunities
opened
to
me
by
mr
and
mrs
boffin
appropriated
by
a
mere
secretary
and
pa
lodger
yet
it
was
not
so
very
long
ago
that
bella
had
been
fluttered
by
the
discovery
that
this
same
secretary
and
lodger
seem
to
like
her
ah
but
the
eminently
aristocratic
mansion
and
mrs
boffin
dressmaker
had
not
come
into
play
then
in
spite
of
his
seemingly
retiring
manners
a
very
intrusive
person
this
secretary
and
lodger
in
miss
bella
opinion
always
a
light
in
his
when
we
came
home
from
the
play
or
opera
and
he
always
at
the
to
hand
us
out
always
a
provoking
radiance
too
on
mrs
boffin
face
and
an
abominably
cheerful
reception
of
him
as
if
it
were
possible
seriously
to
approve
what
the
man
had
in
his
mind
never
charge
me
miss
wilfer
said
the
secretary
encountering
her
by
chance
alone
in
the
great
commissions
for
home
i
shall
always
be
happy
to
execute
any
commands
you
may
have
in
that
direction
what
may
you
mean
mr
rokesmith
inquired
miss
bella
with
languidly
drooping
eyelids
home
i
mean
your
father
house
at
holloway
she
coloured
under
the
retort
so
skilfully
thrust
that
the
words
seemed
to
be
merely
a
plain
answer
given
in
plain
good
faith
and
said
rather
more
emphatically
and
sharply
commissions
and
commands
are
you
speaking
of
little
words
of
remembrance
as
i
assume
you
sent
somehow
or
other
replied
the
secretary
with
his
former
air
would
be
a
pleasure
to
me
if
you
would
make
me
the
bearer
of
them
as
you
know
i
come
and
go
between
the
two
houses
every
day
need
remind
me
of
that
sir
she
was
too
quick
in
this
petulant
sally
against
lodger
and
she
felt
that
she
had
been
so
when
she
met
his
quiet
look
do
send
many
what
was
your
expression
words
of
remembrance
to
me
said
bella
making
haste
to
take
refuge
in
frequently
ask
me
about
you
and
i
give
them
such
slight
intelligence
as
i
can
hope
it
truly
given
exclaimed
bella
hope
you
can
not
doubt
it
for
it
would
be
very
much
against
you
if
you
could
i
do
not
doubt
it
i
deserve
the
reproach
which
is
very
just
indeed
i
beg
your
pardon
mr
rokesmith
should
beg
you
not
to
do
so
but
that
it
shows
you
to
such
admirable
advantage
he
replied
with
earnestness
me
i
could
not
help
saying
that
to
return
to
what
i
have
digressed
from
let
me
add
that
perhaps
they
think
i
report
them
to
you
deliver
little
messages
and
the
like
but
i
forbear
to
trouble
you
as
you
never
ask
me
am
going
sir
said
bella
looking
at
him
as
if
he
had
reproved
her
see
them
tomorrow
that
he
asked
hesitating
to
me
or
to
them
which
you
please
both
shall
i
make
it
a
message
can
if
you
like
mr
rokesmith
message
or
no
message
i
am
going
to
see
them
tomorrow
i
will
tell
them
so
he
lingered
a
moment
as
though
to
give
her
the
opportunity
of
prolonging
the
conversation
if
she
wished
as
she
remained
silent
he
left
her
two
incidents
of
the
little
interview
were
felt
by
miss
bella
herself
when
alone
again
to
be
very
curious
the
first
was
that
he
unquestionably
left
her
with
a
penitent
air
upon
her
and
a
penitent
feeling
in
her
heart
the
second
was
that
she
had
not
an
intention
or
a
thought
of
going
home
until
she
had
announced
it
to
him
as
a
settled
design
can
i
mean
by
it
or
what
can
he
mean
by
it
was
her
mental
inquiry
has
no
right
to
any
power
over
me
and
how
do
i
come
to
mind
him
when
i
do
care
for
him
mrs
boffin
insisting
that
bella
should
make
tomorrow
expedition
in
the
chariot
she
went
home
in
great
grandeur
mrs
wilfer
and
miss
lavinia
had
speculated
much
on
the
probabilities
and
improbabilities
of
her
coming
in
this
gorgeous
state
and
on
beholding
the
chariot
from
the
window
at
which
they
were
secreted
to
look
out
for
it
agreed
that
it
must
be
detained
at
the
door
as
long
as
possible
for
the
mortification
and
confusion
of
the
neighbours
then
they
repaired
to
the
usual
family
room
to
receive
miss
bella
with
a
becoming
show
of
indifference
the
family
room
looked
very
small
and
very
mean
and
the
downward
staircase
by
which
it
was
attained
looked
very
narrow
and
very
crooked
the
little
house
and
all
its
arrangements
were
a
poor
contrast
to
the
eminently
aristocratic
dwelling
can
hardly
believe
thought
bella
i
ever
did
endure
life
in
this
place
gloomy
majesty
on
the
part
of
mrs
wilfer
and
native
pertness
on
the
part
of
lavvy
did
not
mend
the
matter
bella
really
stood
in
natural
need
of
a
little
help
and
she
got
none
said
mrs
wilfer
presenting
a
cheek
to
be
kissed
as
sympathetic
and
responsive
as
the
back
of
the
bowl
of
a
spoon
quite
an
honour
you
will
probably
find
your
sister
lavvy
grown
bella
miss
lavinia
interposed
can
be
no
objection
to
your
being
aggravating
because
bella
richly
deserves
it
but
i
really
must
request
that
you
will
not
drag
in
such
ridiculous
nonsense
as
my
having
grown
when
i
am
past
the
growing
age
grew
myself
mrs
wilfer
sternly
proclaimed
i
was
married
well
ma
returned
lavvy
i
think
you
had
much
better
have
left
it
alone
the
lofty
glare
with
which
the
majestic
woman
received
this
answer
might
have
embarrassed
a
less
pert
opponent
but
it
had
no
effect
upon
lavinia
who
leaving
her
parent
to
the
enjoyment
of
any
amount
of
glaring
at
she
might
deem
desirable
under
the
circumstances
accosted
her
sister
undismayed
suppose
you
wo
consider
yourself
quite
disgraced
bella
if
i
give
you
a
kiss
well
and
how
do
you
do
bella
and
how
are
your
boffins
exclaimed
mrs
wilfer
i
will
not
suffer
this
tone
of
levity
goodness
me
how
are
your
spoffins
then
said
lavvy
ma
so
very
much
objects
to
your
boffins
girl
minx
said
mrs
wilfer
with
dread
severity
do
care
whether
i
am
a
minx
or
a
sphinx
returned
lavinia
coolly
tossing
her
head
exactly
the
same
thing
to
me
and
every
bit
as
soon
be
one
as
the
other
but
i
know
this
i
not
grow
after
i
married
will
not
you
will
not
repeated
mrs
wilfer
solemnly
ma
i
will
not
nothing
shall
induce
me
mrs
wilfer
having
waved
her
gloves
became
loftily
pathetic
it
was
to
be
expected
thus
she
spake
child
of
mine
deserts
me
for
the
proud
and
prosperous
and
another
child
of
mine
despises
me
it
is
quite
fitting
bella
struck
in
and
mrs
boffin
are
prosperous
no
doubt
but
you
have
no
right
to
say
they
are
proud
you
must
know
very
well
that
they
are
not
short
ma
said
lavvy
bouncing
over
to
the
enemy
without
a
word
of
notice
must
know
very
well
or
if
you
do
more
shame
for
you
that
mr
and
mrs
boffin
are
just
absolute
perfection
returned
mrs
wilfer
courteously
receiving
the
deserter
would
seem
that
we
are
required
to
think
so
and
this
lavinia
is
my
reason
for
objecting
to
a
tone
of
levity
mrs
boffin
of
whose
physiognomy
i
can
never
speak
with
the
composure
i
would
desire
to
preserve
and
your
mother
are
not
on
terms
of
intimacy
it
is
not
for
a
moment
to
be
supposed
that
she
and
her
husband
dare
to
presume
to
speak
of
this
family
as
the
wilfers
i
can
not
therefore
condescend
to
speak
of
them
as
the
boffins
no
for
such
a
tone
call
it
familiarity
levity
equality
or
what
you
will
would
imply
those
social
interchanges
which
do
not
exist
do
i
render
myself
intelligible
without
taking
the
least
notice
of
this
inquiry
albeit
delivered
in
an
imposing
and
forensic
manner
lavinia
reminded
her
sister
all
you
know
bella
you
have
told
us
how
your
whatshisnames
are
do
want
to
speak
of
them
here
replied
bella
suppressing
indignation
and
tapping
her
foot
on
the
floor
are
much
too
kind
and
too
good
to
be
drawn
into
these
discussions
put
it
so
demanded
mrs
wilfer
with
biting
sarcasm
adopt
a
circuitous
form
of
speech
it
is
polite
and
it
is
obliging
but
why
do
it
why
not
openly
say
that
they
are
much
too
kind
and
too
good
for
us
we
understand
the
allusion
why
disguise
the
phrase
said
bella
with
one
beat
of
her
foot
are
enough
to
drive
a
saint
mad
and
so
is
lavvy
lavvy
cried
mrs
wilfer
in
a
tone
of
commiseration
always
comes
for
it
my
poor
child
but
lavvy
with
the
suddenness
of
her
former
desertion
now
bounced
over
to
the
other
enemy
very
sharply
remarking
patronize
me
ma
because
i
can
take
care
of
myself
only
wonder
resumed
mrs
wilfer
directing
her
observations
to
her
elder
daughter
as
safer
on
the
whole
than
her
utterly
unmanageable
younger
you
found
time
and
inclination
to
tear
yourself
from
mr
and
mrs
boffin
and
come
to
see
us
at
all
i
only
wonder
that
our
claims
contending
against
the
superior
claims
of
mr
and
mrs
boffin
had
any
weight
i
feel
i
ought
to
be
thankful
for
gaining
so
much
in
competition
with
mr
and
mrs
boffin
the
good
lady
bitterly
emphasized
the
first
letter
of
the
word
boffin
as
if
it
represented
her
chief
objection
to
the
owners
of
that
name
and
as
if
she
could
have
born
doffin
moffin
or
poffin
much
better
said
bella
angrily
force
me
to
say
that
i
am
truly
sorry
i
did
come
home
and
that
i
never
will
come
home
again
except
when
poor
dear
pa
is
here
for
pa
is
too
magnanimous
to
feel
envy
and
spite
towards
my
generous
friends
and
pa
is
delicate
enough
and
gentle
enough
to
remember
the
sort
of
little
claim
they
thought
i
had
upon
them
and
the
unusually
trying
position
in
which
through
no
act
of
my
own
i
had
been
placed
and
i
always
did
love
poor
dear
pa
better
than
all
the
rest
of
you
put
together
and
i
always
do
and
i
always
shall
here
bella
deriving
no
comfort
from
her
charming
bonnet
and
her
elegant
dress
burst
into
tears
think
cried
mrs
wilfer
lifting
up
her
eyes
and
apostrophising
the
air
if
you
were
present
it
would
be
a
trial
to
your
feelings
to
hear
your
wife
and
the
mother
of
your
family
depreciated
in
your
name
but
fate
has
spared
you
this
whatever
it
may
have
thought
proper
to
inflict
upon
her
here
mrs
wilfer
burst
into
tears
hate
the
boffins
protested
miss
lavinia
do
care
who
objects
to
their
being
called
the
boffins
i
will
call
the
boffins
the
boffins
the
boffins
the
boffins
and
i
say
they
are
boffins
and
i
say
the
boffins
have
set
bella
against
me
and
i
tell
the
boffins
to
their
faces
which
was
not
strictly
the
fact
but
the
young
lady
was
excited
they
are
detestable
boffins
disreputable
boffins
odious
boffins
beastly
boffins
there
here
miss
lavinia
burst
into
tears
the
front
clanked
and
the
secretary
was
seen
coming
at
a
brisk
pace
up
the
steps
me
to
open
the
door
to
him
said
mrs
wilfer
rising
with
stately
resignation
as
she
shook
her
head
and
dried
her
eyes
have
at
present
no
stipendiary
girl
to
do
so
we
have
nothing
to
conceal
if
he
sees
these
traces
of
emotion
on
our
cheeks
let
him
construe
them
as
he
may
with
those
words
she
stalked
out
in
a
few
moments
she
stalked
in
again
proclaiming
in
her
heraldic
manner
rokesmith
is
the
bearer
of
a
packet
for
miss
bella
wilfer
mr
rokesmith
followed
close
upon
his
name
and
of
course
saw
what
was
amiss
but
he
discreetly
affected
to
see
nothing
and
addressed
miss
bella
boffin
intended
to
have
placed
this
in
the
carriage
for
you
this
morning
he
wished
you
to
have
it
as
a
little
keepsake
he
had
prepared
it
is
only
a
purse
miss
wilfer
but
as
he
was
disappointed
in
his
fancy
i
volunteered
to
come
after
you
with
it
bella
took
it
in
her
hand
and
thanked
him
have
been
quarrelling
here
a
little
mr
rokesmith
but
not
more
than
we
used
you
know
our
agreeable
ways
among
ourselves
you
find
me
just
going
mamma
lavvy
and
with
a
kiss
for
each
miss
bella
turned
to
the
door
the
secretary
would
have
attended
her
but
mrs
wilfer
advancing
and
saying
with
dignity
me
permit
me
to
assert
my
natural
right
to
escort
my
child
to
the
equipage
which
is
in
waiting
for
her
he
begged
pardon
and
gave
place
it
was
a
very
magnificent
spectacle
indeed
to
see
mrs
wilfer
throw
open
the
and
loudly
demand
with
extended
gloves
male
domestic
of
mrs
boffin
to
whom
presenting
himself
she
delivered
the
brief
but
majestic
charge
wilfer
coming
out
and
so
delivered
her
over
like
a
female
lieutenant
of
the
tower
relinquishing
a
state
prisoner
the
effect
of
this
ceremonial
was
for
some
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
perfectly
paralyzing
on
the
neighbours
and
was
much
enhanced
by
the
worthy
lady
airing
herself
for
that
term
in
a
kind
of
splendidly
serene
trance
on
the
top
step
when
bella
was
seated
in
the
carriage
she
opened
the
little
packet
in
her
hand
it
contained
a
pretty
purse
and
the
purse
contained
a
bank
note
for
fifty
pounds
shall
be
a
joyful
surprise
for
poor
dear
pa
said
bella
i
take
it
myself
into
the
city
as
she
was
uninformed
respecting
the
exact
locality
of
the
place
of
business
of
chicksey
veneering
and
stobbles
but
knew
it
to
be
near
mincing
lane
she
directed
herself
to
be
driven
to
the
corner
of
that
darksome
spot
thence
she
despatched
male
domestic
of
mrs
boffin
in
search
of
the
of
chicksey
veneering
and
stobbles
with
a
message
importing
that
if
wilfer
could
come
out
there
was
a
lady
waiting
who
would
be
glad
to
speak
with
him
the
delivery
of
these
mysterious
words
from
the
mouth
of
a
footman
caused
so
great
an
excitement
in
the
that
a
youthful
scout
was
instantly
appointed
to
follow
rumty
observe
the
lady
and
come
in
with
his
report
nor
was
the
agitation
by
any
means
diminished
when
the
scout
rushed
back
with
the
intelligence
that
the
lady
was
gal
in
a
chariot
rumty
himself
with
his
pen
behind
his
ear
under
his
rusty
hat
arrived
at
the
in
a
breathless
condition
and
had
been
fairly
lugged
into
the
vehicle
by
his
cravat
and
embraced
almost
unto
choking
before
he
recognized
his
daughter
dear
child
he
then
panted
incoherently
gracious
me
what
a
lovely
woman
you
are
i
thought
you
had
been
unkind
and
forgotten
your
mother
and
sister
have
just
been
to
see
them
pa
dear
and
how
how
did
you
find
your
mother
asked
dubiously
disagreeable
pa
and
so
was
lavvy
are
sometimes
a
little
liable
to
it
observed
the
patient
cherub
i
hope
you
made
allowances
bella
my
dear
i
was
disagreeable
too
pa
we
were
all
of
us
disagreeable
together
but
i
want
you
to
come
and
dine
with
me
somewhere
my
dear
i
have
already
partaken
of
a
if
one
might
mention
such
an
article
in
this
superb
chariot
of
a
saveloy
replied
wilfer
modestly
dropping
his
voice
on
the
word
as
he
eyed
the
fittings
that
nothing
pa
it
ai
as
much
as
one
could
sometimes
wish
it
to
be
my
dear
he
admitted
drawing
his
hand
across
his
mouth
when
circumstances
over
which
you
have
no
control
interpose
obstacles
between
yourself
and
small
germans
you
ca
do
better
than
bring
a
contented
mind
to
hear
on
again
dropping
his
voice
in
deference
to
the
chariot
poor
good
pa
pa
do
i
beg
and
pray
get
leave
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
come
and
pass
it
with
me
my
dear
i
cut
back
and
ask
for
leave
before
you
cut
back
said
bella
who
had
already
taken
him
by
the
chin
pulled
his
hat
off
and
begun
to
stick
up
his
hair
in
her
old
way
say
that
you
are
sure
i
am
giddy
and
inconsiderate
but
have
never
really
slighted
you
dear
i
say
it
with
all
my
heart
and
might
i
likewise
observe
her
father
delicately
hinted
with
a
glance
out
at
window
perhaps
it
might
be
calculated
to
attract
attention
having
one
hair
publicly
done
by
a
lovely
woman
in
an
elegant
in
fenchurch
street
bella
laughed
and
put
on
his
hat
again
but
when
his
boyish
figure
bobbed
away
its
shabbiness
and
cheerful
patience
smote
the
tears
out
of
her
eyes
hate
that
secretary
for
thinking
it
of
me
she
said
to
herself
yet
it
seems
half
true
back
came
her
father
more
like
a
boy
than
ever
in
his
release
from
school
right
my
dear
leave
given
at
once
really
very
handsomely
done
where
can
we
find
some
quiet
place
pa
in
which
i
can
wait
for
you
while
you
go
on
an
errand
for
me
if
i
send
the
carriage
away
it
demanded
cogitation
see
my
dear
he
explained
really
have
become
such
a
very
lovely
woman
that
it
ought
to
be
a
very
quiet
place
at
length
he
suggested
the
garden
up
by
the
trinity
house
on
tower
hill
so
they
were
driven
there
and
bella
dismissed
the
chariot
sending
a
pencilled
note
by
it
to
mrs
boffin
that
she
was
with
her
father
pa
attend
to
what
i
am
going
to
say
and
promise
and
vow
to
be
obedient
promise
and
vow
my
dear
ask
no
questions
you
take
this
purse
you
go
to
the
nearest
place
where
they
keep
everything
of
the
very
very
best
ready
made
you
buy
and
put
on
the
most
beautiful
suit
of
clothes
the
most
beautiful
hat
and
the
most
beautiful
pair
of
bright
boots
patent
leather
pa
mind
that
are
to
be
got
for
money
and
you
come
back
to
me
my
dear
bella
care
pa
pointing
her
forefinger
at
him
merrily
have
promised
and
vowed
it
perjury
you
know
there
was
water
in
the
foolish
little
fellow
eyes
but
she
kissed
them
dry
though
her
own
were
wet
and
he
bobbed
away
again
after
half
an
hour
he
came
back
so
brilliantly
transformed
that
bella
was
obliged
to
walk
round
him
in
ecstatic
admiration
twenty
times
before
she
could
draw
her
arm
through
his
and
delightedly
squeeze
it
pa
said
bella
hugging
him
close
this
lovely
woman
out
to
dinner
shall
we
go
my
dear
said
bella
valiantly
be
sure
you
treat
this
lovely
woman
with
everything
of
the
best
while
they
were
going
along
to
take
boat
you
wish
my
dear
said
timidly
your
mother
was
here
i
do
pa
for
i
like
to
have
you
all
to
myself
i
was
always
your
little
favourite
at
home
and
you
were
always
mine
we
have
run
away
together
often
before
now
have
we
pa
to
be
sure
we
have
many
a
sunday
when
your
mother
was
was
a
little
liable
to
it
repeating
his
former
delicate
expression
after
pausing
to
cough
and
i
am
afraid
i
was
seldom
or
never
as
good
as
i
ought
to
have
been
pa
i
made
you
carry
me
over
and
over
again
when
you
should
have
made
me
walk
and
i
often
drove
you
in
harness
when
you
would
much
rather
have
sat
down
and
read
your
did
i
sometimes
but
lor
what
a
child
you
were
what
a
companion
you
were
that
just
what
i
want
to
be
are
safe
to
succeed
my
love
your
brothers
and
sisters
have
all
in
their
turns
been
companions
to
me
to
a
certain
extent
but
only
to
a
certain
extent
your
mother
has
throughout
life
been
a
companion
that
any
man
might
might
look
up
to
and
and
commit
the
sayings
of
to
memory
and
form
himself
upon
if
he
he
liked
the
model
suggested
bella
he
returned
thinking
about
it
not
quite
satisfied
with
the
phrase
perhaps
i
might
say
if
it
was
in
him
supposing
for
instance
that
a
man
wanted
to
be
always
marching
he
would
find
your
mother
an
inestimable
companion
but
if
he
had
any
taste
for
walking
or
should
wish
at
any
time
to
break
into
a
trot
he
might
sometimes
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
keep
step
with
your
mother
or
take
it
this
way
bella
he
added
after
a
moment
reflection
that
a
man
had
to
go
through
life
we
wo
say
with
a
companion
but
we
say
to
a
tune
very
good
supposing
that
the
tune
allotted
to
him
was
the
dead
march
in
saul
well
it
would
be
a
very
suitable
tune
for
particular
occasions
none
better
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
keep
time
with
in
the
ordinary
run
of
domestic
transactions
for
instance
if
he
took
his
supper
after
a
hard
day
to
the
dead
march
in
saul
his
food
might
be
likely
to
sit
heavy
on
him
or
if
he
was
at
any
time
inclined
to
relieve
his
mind
by
singing
a
comic
song
or
dancing
a
hornpipe
and
was
obliged
to
do
it
to
the
dead
march
in
saul
he
might
find
himself
put
out
in
the
execution
of
his
lively
intentions
pa
thought
bella
as
she
hung
upon
his
arm
what
i
will
say
for
you
my
dear
the
cherub
pursued
mildly
and
without
a
notion
of
complaining
that
you
are
so
adaptable
so
adaptable
i
am
afraid
i
have
shown
a
wretched
temper
pa
i
am
afraid
i
have
been
very
complaining
and
very
capricious
i
seldom
or
never
thought
of
it
before
but
when
i
sat
in
the
carriage
just
now
and
saw
you
coming
along
the
pavement
i
reproached
myself
at
all
my
dear
do
speak
of
such
a
thing
a
happy
and
a
chatty
man
was
pa
in
his
new
clothes
that
day
take
it
for
all
in
all
it
was
perhaps
the
happiest
day
he
had
ever
known
in
his
life
not
even
excepting
that
on
which
his
heroic
partner
had
approached
the
nuptial
altar
to
the
tune
of
the
dead
march
in
saul
the
little
expedition
down
the
river
was
delightful
and
the
little
room
overlooking
the
river
into
which
they
were
shown
for
dinner
was
delightful
everything
was
delightful
the
park
was
delightful
the
punch
was
delightful
the
dishes
of
fish
were
delightful
the
wine
was
delightful
bella
was
more
delightful
than
any
other
item
in
the
festival
drawing
pa
out
in
the
gayest
manner
making
a
point
of
always
mentioning
herself
as
the
lovely
woman
stimulating
pa
to
order
things
by
declaring
that
the
lovely
woman
insisted
on
being
treated
with
them
and
in
short
causing
pa
to
be
quite
enraptured
with
the
consideration
that
he
was
the
pa
of
such
a
charming
daughter
and
then
as
they
sat
looking
at
the
ships
and
steamboats
making
their
way
to
the
sea
with
the
tide
that
was
running
down
the
lovely
woman
imagined
all
sorts
of
voyages
for
herself
and
now
pa
in
the
character
of
owner
of
a
lumbering
collier
was
tacking
away
to
newcastle
to
fetch
black
diamonds
to
make
his
fortune
with
now
pa
was
going
to
china
in
that
handsome
threemasted
ship
to
bring
home
opium
with
which
he
would
for
ever
cut
out
chicksey
veneering
and
stobbles
and
to
bring
home
silks
and
shawls
without
end
for
the
decoration
of
his
charming
daughter
now
john
harmon
disastrous
fate
was
all
a
dream
and
he
had
come
home
and
found
the
lovely
woman
just
the
article
for
him
and
the
lovely
woman
had
found
him
just
the
article
for
her
and
they
were
going
away
on
a
trip
in
their
gallant
bark
to
look
after
their
vines
with
streamers
flying
at
all
points
a
band
playing
on
deck
and
pa
established
in
the
great
cabin
now
john
harmon
was
consigned
to
his
grave
again
and
a
merchant
of
immense
wealth
name
unknown
had
courted
and
married
the
lovely
woman
and
he
was
so
enormously
rich
that
everything
you
saw
upon
the
river
sailing
or
steaming
belonged
to
him
and
he
kept
a
perfect
fleet
of
yachts
for
pleasure
and
that
little
impudent
yacht
which
you
saw
over
there
with
the
great
white
sail
was
called
the
bella
in
honour
of
his
wife
and
she
held
her
state
aboard
when
it
pleased
her
like
a
modern
cleopatra
anon
there
would
embark
in
that
when
she
got
to
gravesend
a
mighty
general
of
large
property
name
also
unknown
who
hear
of
going
to
victory
without
his
wife
and
whose
wife
was
the
lovely
woman
and
she
was
destined
to
become
the
idol
of
all
the
red
coats
and
blue
jackets
alow
and
aloft
and
then
again
you
saw
that
ship
being
towed
out
by
a
well
where
did
you
suppose
she
was
going
to
she
was
going
among
the
coral
reefs
and
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
she
was
chartered
for
a
fortunate
individual
of
the
name
of
pa
himself
on
board
and
much
respected
by
all
hands
and
she
was
going
for
his
sole
profit
and
advantage
to
fetch
a
cargo
of
woods
the
most
beautiful
that
ever
were
seen
and
the
most
profitable
that
ever
were
heard
of
and
her
cargo
would
be
a
great
fortune
as
indeed
it
ought
to
be
the
lovely
woman
who
had
purchased
her
and
fitted
her
expressly
for
this
voyage
being
married
to
an
indian
prince
who
was
a
and
who
wore
cashmere
shawls
all
over
himself
and
diamonds
and
emeralds
blazing
in
his
turban
and
was
beautifully
and
excessively
devoted
though
a
little
too
jealous
thus
bella
ran
on
merrily
in
a
manner
perfectly
enchanting
to
pa
who
was
as
willing
to
put
his
head
into
the
sultan
tub
of
water
as
the
below
the
window
were
to
put
their
heads
in
the
mud
suppose
my
dear
said
pa
after
dinner
may
come
to
the
conclusion
at
home
that
we
have
lost
you
for
good
bella
shook
her
head
did
know
could
say
all
she
was
able
to
report
was
that
she
was
most
handsomely
supplied
with
everything
she
could
possibly
want
and
that
whenever
she
hinted
at
leaving
mr
and
mrs
boffin
they
would
hear
of
it
now
pa
pursued
bella
make
a
confession
to
you
i
am
the
most
mercenary
little
wretch
that
ever
lived
in
the
world
should
hardly
have
thought
it
of
you
my
dear
returned
her
father
first
glancing
at
himself
and
then
at
the
dessert
understand
what
you
mean
pa
but
it
not
that
it
not
that
i
care
for
money
to
keep
as
money
but
i
do
care
so
much
for
what
it
will
buy
i
think
most
of
us
do
returned
not
to
the
dreadful
extent
that
i
do
pa
cried
bella
screwing
the
exclamation
out
of
herself
with
a
twist
of
her
dimpled
chin
am
so
mercenary
with
a
wistful
glance
said
in
default
of
having
anything
better
to
say
when
did
you
begin
to
feel
it
coming
on
my
dear
it
that
the
terrible
part
of
it
when
i
was
at
home
and
only
knew
what
it
was
to
be
poor
i
grumbled
but
did
so
much
mind
when
i
was
at
home
expecting
to
be
rich
i
thought
vaguely
of
all
the
great
things
i
would
do
but
when
i
had
been
disappointed
of
my
splendid
fortune
and
came
to
see
it
from
day
to
day
in
other
hands
and
to
have
before
my
eyes
what
it
could
really
do
then
i
became
the
mercenary
little
wretch
i
am
your
fancy
my
dear
can
assure
you
it
nothing
of
the
sort
pa
said
bella
nodding
at
him
with
her
very
pretty
eyebrows
raised
as
high
as
they
would
go
and
looking
comically
frightened
a
fact
i
am
always
avariciously
scheming
but
how
tell
you
pa
i
do
mind
telling
you
because
we
have
always
been
favourites
of
each
other
and
because
you
are
not
like
a
pa
but
more
like
a
sort
of
a
younger
brother
with
a
dear
venerable
chubbiness
on
him
and
besides
added
bella
laughing
as
she
pointed
a
rallying
finger
at
his
face
i
have
got
you
in
my
power
this
is
a
secret
expedition
if
ever
you
tell
of
me
i
tell
of
you
i
tell
ma
that
you
dined
at
greenwich
seriously
my
dear
observed
with
some
trepidation
of
manner
might
be
as
well
not
to
mention
it
laughed
bella
knew
you
would
like
it
sir
so
you
keep
my
confidence
and
i
keep
yours
but
betray
the
lovely
woman
and
you
shall
find
her
a
serpent
now
you
may
give
me
a
kiss
pa
and
i
should
like
to
give
your
hair
a
turn
because
it
has
been
dreadfully
neglected
in
my
absence
submitted
his
head
to
the
operator
and
the
operator
went
on
talking
at
the
same
time
putting
separate
locks
of
his
hair
through
a
curious
process
of
being
smartly
rolled
over
her
two
revolving
forefingers
which
were
then
suddenly
pulled
out
of
it
in
opposite
lateral
directions
on
each
of
these
occasions
the
patient
winced
and
winked
have
made
up
my
mind
that
i
must
have
money
pa
i
feel
that
i
beg
it
borrow
it
or
steal
it
and
so
i
have
resolved
that
i
must
marry
it
cast
up
his
eyes
towards
her
as
well
as
he
could
under
the
operating
circumstances
and
said
in
a
tone
of
remonstrance
bella
resolved
i
say
pa
that
to
get
money
i
must
marry
money
in
consequence
of
which
i
am
always
looking
out
for
money
to
captivate
bella
pa
that
is
the
state
of
the
case
if
ever
there
was
a
mercenary
plotter
whose
thoughts
and
designs
were
always
in
her
mean
occupation
i
am
the
amiable
creature
but
i
do
care
i
hate
and
detest
being
poor
and
i
wo
be
poor
if
i
can
marry
money
now
you
are
deliciously
fluffy
pa
and
in
a
state
to
astonish
the
waiter
and
pay
the
bill
my
dear
bella
this
is
quite
alarming
at
your
age
told
you
so
pa
but
you
would
believe
it
returned
bella
with
a
pleasant
childish
gravity
it
shocking
would
be
quite
so
if
you
fully
knew
what
you
said
my
dear
or
meant
it
pa
i
can
only
tell
you
that
i
mean
nothing
else
talk
to
me
of
love
said
bella
contemptuously
though
her
face
and
figure
certainly
rendered
the
subject
no
incongruous
one
to
me
of
fiery
dragons
but
talk
to
me
of
poverty
and
wealth
and
there
indeed
we
touch
upon
realities
this
is
becoming
awful
her
father
was
emphatically
beginning
when
she
stopped
him
tell
me
did
you
marry
money
know
i
did
my
dear
bella
hummed
the
dead
march
in
saul
and
said
after
all
it
signified
very
little
but
seeing
him
look
grave
and
downcast
she
took
him
round
the
neck
and
kissed
him
back
to
cheerfulness
again
did
mean
that
last
touch
pa
it
was
only
said
in
joke
now
mind
you
are
not
to
tell
of
me
and
i
not
tell
of
you
and
more
than
that
i
promise
to
have
no
secrets
from
you
pa
and
you
may
make
certain
that
whatever
mercenary
things
go
on
i
shall
always
tell
you
all
about
them
in
strict
confidence
fain
to
be
satisfied
with
this
concession
from
the
lovely
woman
rang
the
bell
and
paid
the
bill
all
the
rest
of
this
pa
said
bella
rolling
up
the
purse
when
they
were
alone
again
hammering
it
small
with
her
little
fist
on
the
table
and
cramming
it
into
one
of
the
pockets
of
his
new
waistcoat
for
you
to
buy
presents
with
for
them
at
home
and
to
pay
bills
with
and
to
divide
as
you
like
and
spend
exactly
as
you
think
proper
last
of
all
take
notice
pa
that
not
the
fruit
of
any
avaricious
scheme
perhaps
if
it
was
your
little
mercenary
wretch
of
a
daughter
would
make
so
free
with
it
after
which
she
tugged
at
his
coat
with
both
hands
and
pulled
him
all
askew
in
buttoning
that
garment
over
the
precious
waistcoat
pocket
and
then
tied
her
dimples
into
her
in
a
very
knowing
way
and
took
him
back
to
london
arrived
at
mr
boffin
door
she
set
him
with
his
back
against
it
tenderly
took
him
by
the
ears
as
convenient
handles
for
her
purpose
and
kissed
him
until
he
knocked
muffled
double
knocks
at
the
door
with
the
back
of
his
head
that
done
she
once
more
reminded
him
of
their
compact
and
gaily
parted
from
him
not
so
gaily
however
but
that
tears
filled
her
eyes
as
he
went
away
down
the
dark
street
not
so
gaily
but
that
she
several
times
said
poor
little
pa
ah
poor
dear
struggling
shabby
little
pa
before
she
took
heart
to
knock
at
the
door
not
so
gaily
but
that
the
brilliant
furniture
seemed
to
stare
her
out
of
countenance
as
if
it
insisted
on
being
compared
with
the
dingy
furniture
at
home
not
so
gaily
but
that
she
fell
into
very
low
spirits
sitting
late
in
her
own
room
and
very
heartily
wept
as
she
wished
now
that
the
deceased
old
john
harmon
had
never
made
a
will
about
her
now
that
the
deceased
young
john
harmon
had
lived
to
marry
her
things
to
wish
said
bella
my
life
and
fortunes
are
so
contradictory
altogether
that
what
can
i
expect
myself
to
be
chapter
in
which
the
orphan
makes
his
will
the
secretary
working
in
the
dismal
swamp
betimes
next
morning
was
informed
that
a
youth
waited
in
the
hall
who
gave
the
name
of
sloppy
the
footman
who
communicated
this
intelligence
made
a
decent
pause
before
uttering
the
name
to
express
that
it
was
forced
on
his
reluctance
by
the
youth
in
question
and
that
if
the
youth
had
had
the
good
sense
and
good
taste
to
inherit
some
other
name
it
would
have
spared
the
feelings
of
him
the
bearer
boffin
will
be
very
well
pleased
said
the
secretary
in
a
perfectly
composed
way
him
in
mr
sloppy
being
introduced
remained
close
to
the
door
revealing
in
various
parts
of
his
form
many
surprising
confounding
and
incomprehensible
buttons
am
glad
to
see
you
said
john
rokesmith
in
a
cheerful
tone
of
welcome
have
been
expecting
you
sloppy
explained
that
he
had
meant
to
come
before
but
that
the
orphan
of
whom
he
made
mention
as
our
johnny
had
been
ailing
and
he
had
waited
to
report
him
well
he
is
well
now
said
the
secretary
he
ai
said
sloppy
mr
sloppy
having
shaken
his
head
to
a
considerable
extent
proceeded
to
remark
that
he
thought
johnny
have
took
from
the
minders
being
asked
what
he
meant
he
answered
them
that
come
out
upon
him
and
partickler
his
chest
being
requested
to
explain
himself
he
stated
that
there
was
some
of
wot
you
could
kiver
with
a
sixpence
pressed
to
fall
back
upon
a
nominative
case
he
opined
that
they
wos
about
as
red
as
ever
red
could
be
as
long
as
they
strikes
sir
continued
sloppy
ai
so
much
it
their
striking
that
to
be
kep
off
john
rokesmith
hoped
the
child
had
had
medical
attendance
oh
yes
said
sloppy
he
had
been
took
to
the
doctor
shop
once
and
what
did
the
doctor
call
it
rokesmith
asked
him
after
some
perplexed
reflection
sloppy
answered
brightening
called
it
something
as
wos
wery
long
for
spots
rokesmith
suggested
measles
said
sloppy
with
confidence
so
much
longer
than
them
sir
mr
sloppy
was
elevated
by
this
fact
and
seemed
to
consider
that
it
reflected
credit
on
the
poor
little
patient
boffin
will
be
sorry
to
hear
this
said
rokesmith
higden
said
so
sir
when
she
kep
it
from
her
hoping
as
our
johnny
would
work
round
i
hope
he
will
said
rokesmith
with
a
quick
turn
upon
the
messenger
hope
so
answered
sloppy
all
depends
on
their
striking
he
then
went
on
to
say
that
whether
johnny
had
from
the
minders
or
whether
the
minders
had
em
from
johnny
the
minders
had
been
sent
home
and
had
em
furthermore
that
mrs
higden
days
and
nights
being
devoted
to
our
johnny
who
was
never
out
of
her
lap
the
whole
of
the
mangling
arrangements
had
devolved
upon
himself
and
he
had
had
a
tight
time
the
ungainly
piece
of
honesty
beamed
and
blushed
as
he
said
it
quite
enraptured
with
the
remembrance
of
having
been
serviceable
night
said
sloppy
i
was
at
the
wheel
pretty
late
the
mangle
seemed
to
go
like
our
johnny
breathing
it
begun
beautiful
then
as
it
went
out
it
shook
a
little
and
got
unsteady
then
as
it
took
the
turn
to
come
home
it
had
a
and
lumbered
a
bit
then
it
come
smooth
and
so
it
went
on
till
i
scarce
know
which
was
mangle
and
which
was
our
johnny
nor
our
johnny
he
scarce
either
for
sometimes
when
the
mangle
lumbers
he
says
me
choking
granny
and
mrs
higden
holds
him
up
in
her
lap
and
says
to
me
bide
a
bit
sloppy
and
we
all
stops
together
and
when
our
johnny
gets
his
breathing
again
i
turns
again
and
we
all
goes
on
together
sloppy
had
gradually
expanded
with
his
description
into
a
stare
and
a
vacant
grin
he
now
contracted
being
silent
into
a
gush
of
tears
and
under
pretence
of
being
heated
drew
the
under
part
of
his
sleeve
across
his
eyes
with
a
singularly
awkward
laborious
and
roundabout
smear
is
unfortunate
said
rokesmith
must
go
and
break
it
to
mrs
boffin
stay
you
here
sloppy
sloppy
stayed
there
staring
at
the
pattern
of
the
paper
on
the
wall
until
the
secretary
and
mrs
boffin
came
back
together
and
with
mrs
boffin
was
a
young
lady
miss
bella
wilfer
by
name
who
was
better
worth
staring
at
it
occurred
to
sloppy
than
the
best
of
my
poor
dear
pretty
little
john
harmon
exclaimed
mrs
boffin
mum
said
the
sympathetic
sloppy
do
think
he
is
in
a
very
very
bad
way
do
you
asked
the
pleasant
creature
with
her
wholesome
cordiality
put
upon
his
good
faith
and
finding
it
in
collision
with
his
inclinations
sloppy
threw
back
his
head
and
uttered
a
mellifluous
howl
rounded
off
with
a
sniff
bad
as
that
cried
mrs
boffin
betty
higden
not
to
tell
me
of
it
sooner
think
she
might
have
been
mistrustful
mum
answered
sloppy
hesitating
what
for
heaven
sake
think
she
might
have
been
mistrustful
mum
returned
sloppy
with
submission
standing
in
our
johnny
light
there
so
much
trouble
in
illness
and
so
much
expense
and
she
seen
such
a
lot
of
its
being
objected
to
she
never
can
have
thought
said
mrs
boffin
i
would
grudge
the
dear
child
anything
mum
but
she
might
have
thought
as
a
of
its
standing
in
johnny
light
and
might
have
tried
to
bring
him
through
it
unbeknownst
sloppy
knew
his
ground
well
to
conceal
herself
in
sickness
like
a
lower
animal
to
creep
out
of
sight
and
coil
herself
away
and
die
had
become
this
woman
instinct
to
catch
up
in
her
arms
the
sick
child
who
was
dear
to
her
and
hide
it
as
if
it
were
a
criminal
and
keep
off
all
ministration
but
such
as
her
own
ignorant
tenderness
and
patience
could
supply
had
become
this
woman
idea
of
maternal
love
fidelity
and
duty
the
shameful
accounts
we
read
every
week
in
the
christian
year
my
lords
and
gentlemen
and
honourable
boards
the
infamous
records
of
small
official
inhumanity
do
not
pass
by
the
people
as
they
pass
by
us
and
hence
these
irrational
blind
and
obstinate
prejudices
so
astonishing
to
our
magnificence
and
having
no
more
reason
in
them
god
save
the
queen
and
confound
their
politics
no
than
smoke
has
in
coming
from
fire
not
a
right
place
for
the
poor
child
to
stay
in
said
mrs
boffin
us
dear
mr
rokesmith
what
to
do
for
the
best
he
had
already
thought
what
to
do
and
the
consultation
was
very
short
he
could
pave
the
way
he
said
in
half
an
hour
and
then
they
would
go
down
to
brentford
take
me
said
bella
therefore
a
carriage
was
ordered
of
capacity
to
take
them
all
and
in
the
meantime
sloppy
was
regaled
feasting
alone
in
the
secretary
room
with
a
complete
realization
of
that
fairy
vision
meat
beer
vegetables
and
pudding
in
consequence
of
which
his
buttons
became
more
importunate
of
public
notice
than
before
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three
about
the
region
of
the
waistband
which
modestly
withdrew
into
a
creasy
retirement
punctual
to
the
time
appeared
the
carriage
and
the
secretary
he
sat
on
the
box
and
mr
sloppy
graced
the
rumble
so
to
the
three
magpies
as
before
where
mrs
boffin
and
miss
bella
were
handed
out
and
whence
they
all
went
on
foot
to
mrs
betty
higden
but
on
the
way
down
they
had
stopped
at
a
and
had
bought
that
noble
charger
a
description
of
whose
points
and
trappings
had
on
the
last
occasion
conciliated
the
then
orphan
and
also
a
noah
ark
and
also
a
yellow
bird
with
an
artificial
voice
in
him
and
also
a
military
doll
so
well
dressed
that
if
he
had
only
been
of
his
in
the
guards
might
never
have
found
him
out
bearing
these
gifts
they
raised
the
latch
of
betty
higden
door
and
saw
her
sitting
in
the
dimmest
and
furthest
corner
with
poor
johnny
in
her
lap
how
my
boy
betty
asked
mrs
boffin
sitting
down
beside
her
bad
he
bad
said
betty
begin
to
be
afeerd
he
not
be
yours
any
more
than
mine
all
others
belonging
to
him
have
gone
to
the
power
and
the
glory
and
i
have
a
mind
that
they
drawing
him
to
them
leading
him
away
no
no
said
mrs
boffin
do
know
why
else
he
clenches
his
little
hand
as
if
it
had
hold
of
a
finger
that
i
ca
see
look
at
it
said
betty
opening
the
wrappers
in
which
the
flushed
child
lay
and
showing
his
small
right
hand
lying
closed
upon
his
breast
always
so
it
do
mind
me
he
asleep
i
think
not
you
not
asleep
my
johnny
said
johnny
with
a
quiet
air
of
pity
for
himself
and
without
opening
his
eyes
the
lady
johnny
and
the
horse
johnny
could
bear
the
lady
with
complete
indifference
but
not
the
horse
opening
his
heavy
eyes
he
slowly
broke
into
a
smile
on
beholding
that
splendid
phenomenon
and
wanted
to
take
it
in
his
arms
as
it
was
much
too
big
it
was
put
upon
a
chair
where
he
could
hold
it
by
the
mane
and
contemplate
it
which
he
soon
forgot
to
do
but
johnny
murmuring
something
with
his
eyes
closed
and
mrs
boffin
not
knowing
what
old
betty
bent
her
ear
to
listen
and
took
pains
to
understand
being
asked
by
her
to
repeat
what
he
had
said
he
did
so
two
or
three
times
and
then
it
came
out
that
he
must
have
seen
more
than
they
supposed
when
he
looked
up
to
see
the
horse
for
the
murmur
was
is
the
boofer
lady
now
the
boofer
or
beautiful
lady
was
bella
and
whereas
this
notice
from
the
poor
baby
would
have
touched
her
of
itself
it
was
rendered
more
pathetic
by
the
late
melting
of
her
heart
to
her
poor
little
father
and
their
joke
about
the
lovely
woman
so
bella
behaviour
was
very
tender
and
very
natural
when
she
kneeled
on
the
brick
floor
to
clasp
the
child
and
when
the
child
with
a
admiration
of
what
is
young
and
pretty
fondled
the
boofer
lady
my
good
dear
betty
said
mrs
boffin
hoping
that
she
saw
her
opportunity
and
laying
her
hand
persuasively
on
her
arm
have
come
to
remove
johnny
from
this
cottage
to
where
he
can
be
taken
better
care
of
instantly
and
before
another
word
could
be
spoken
the
old
woman
started
up
with
blazing
eyes
and
rushed
at
the
door
with
the
sick
child
away
from
me
every
one
of
ye
she
cried
out
wildly
see
what
ye
mean
now
let
me
go
my
way
all
of
ye
i
sooner
kill
the
pretty
and
kill
myself
stay
said
rokesmith
soothing
her
do
understand
understand
too
well
i
know
too
much
about
it
sir
i
run
from
it
too
many
a
year
no
never
for
me
nor
for
the
child
while
water
enough
in
england
to
cover
us
the
terror
the
shame
the
passion
of
horror
and
repugnance
firing
the
worn
face
and
perfectly
maddening
it
would
have
been
a
quite
terrible
sight
if
embodied
in
one
old
alone
yet
it
up
as
our
slang
goes
my
lords
and
gentlemen
and
honourable
boards
in
other
rather
frequently
been
chasing
me
all
my
life
but
it
shall
never
take
me
nor
mine
alive
cried
old
betty
done
with
ye
i
have
fastened
door
and
window
and
starved
out
afore
i
ever
have
let
ye
in
if
i
had
known
what
ye
came
for
but
catching
sight
of
mrs
boffin
wholesome
face
she
relented
and
crouching
down
by
the
door
and
bending
over
her
burden
to
hush
it
said
humbly
my
fears
has
put
me
wrong
if
they
have
so
tell
me
and
the
good
lord
forgive
me
i
quick
to
take
this
fright
i
know
and
my
head
is
light
with
wearying
and
watching
there
there
returned
mrs
boffin
come
say
no
more
of
it
betty
it
was
a
mistake
a
mistake
any
one
of
us
might
have
made
it
in
your
place
and
felt
just
as
you
do
lord
bless
ye
said
the
old
woman
stretching
out
her
hand
see
betty
pursued
the
sweet
compassionate
soul
holding
the
hand
kindly
i
really
did
mean
and
what
i
should
have
begun
by
saying
out
if
i
had
only
been
a
little
wiser
and
handier
we
want
to
move
johnny
to
a
place
where
there
are
none
but
children
a
place
set
up
on
purpose
for
sick
children
where
the
good
doctors
and
nurses
pass
their
lives
with
children
talk
to
none
but
children
touch
none
but
children
comfort
and
cure
none
but
children
there
really
such
a
place
asked
the
old
woman
with
a
gaze
of
wonder
betty
on
my
word
and
you
shall
see
it
if
my
home
was
a
better
place
for
the
dear
boy
i
take
him
to
it
but
indeed
indeed
it
not
shall
take
him
returned
betty
fervently
kissing
the
comforting
hand
you
will
my
deary
i
am
not
so
hard
but
that
i
believe
your
face
and
voice
and
i
will
as
long
as
i
can
see
and
hear
this
victory
gained
rokesmith
made
haste
to
profit
by
it
for
he
saw
how
woefully
time
had
been
lost
he
despatched
sloppy
to
bring
the
carriage
to
the
door
caused
the
child
to
be
carefully
wrapped
up
bade
old
betty
get
her
bonnet
on
collected
the
toys
enabling
the
little
fellow
to
comprehend
that
his
treasures
were
to
be
transported
with
him
and
had
all
things
prepared
so
easily
that
they
were
ready
for
the
carriage
as
soon
as
it
appeared
and
in
a
minute
afterwards
were
on
their
way
sloppy
they
left
behind
relieving
his
overcharged
breast
with
a
paroxysm
of
mangling
at
the
children
hospital
the
gallant
steed
the
noah
ark
yellow
bird
and
the
officer
in
the
guards
were
made
as
welcome
as
their
but
the
doctor
said
aside
to
rokesmith
should
have
been
days
ago
too
late
however
they
were
all
carried
up
into
a
fresh
airy
room
and
there
johnny
came
to
himself
out
of
a
sleep
or
a
swoon
or
whatever
it
was
to
find
himself
lying
in
a
little
quiet
bed
with
a
little
platform
over
his
breast
on
which
were
already
arranged
to
give
him
heart
and
urge
him
to
cheer
up
the
noah
ark
the
noble
steed
and
the
yellow
bird
with
the
officer
in
the
guards
doing
duty
over
the
whole
quite
as
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
country
as
if
he
had
been
upon
parade
and
at
the
bed
head
was
a
coloured
picture
beautiful
to
see
representing
as
it
were
another
johnny
seated
on
the
knee
of
some
angel
surely
who
loved
little
children
and
marvellous
fact
to
lie
and
stare
at
johnny
had
become
one
of
a
little
family
all
in
little
quiet
beds
except
two
playing
dominoes
in
little
at
a
little
table
on
the
hearth
and
on
all
the
little
beds
were
little
platforms
whereon
were
to
be
seen
dolls
houses
woolly
dogs
with
mechanical
barks
in
them
not
very
dissimilar
from
the
artificial
voice
pervading
the
bowels
of
the
yellow
bird
tin
armies
moorish
tumblers
wooden
tea
things
and
the
riches
of
the
earth
as
johnny
murmured
something
in
his
placid
admiration
the
ministering
women
at
his
bed
head
asked
him
what
he
said
it
seemed
that
he
wanted
to
know
whether
all
these
were
brothers
and
sisters
of
his
so
they
told
him
yes
it
seemed
then
that
he
wanted
to
know
whether
god
had
brought
them
all
together
there
so
they
told
him
yes
again
they
made
out
then
that
he
wanted
to
know
whether
they
would
all
get
out
of
pain
so
they
answered
yes
to
that
question
likewise
and
made
him
understand
that
the
reply
included
himself
johnny
powers
of
sustaining
conversation
were
as
yet
so
very
imperfectly
developed
even
in
a
state
of
health
that
in
sickness
they
were
little
more
than
monosyllabic
but
he
had
to
be
washed
and
tended
and
remedies
were
applied
and
though
those
offices
were
far
far
more
skilfully
and
lightly
done
than
ever
anything
had
been
done
for
him
in
his
little
life
so
rough
and
short
they
would
have
hurt
and
tired
him
but
for
an
amazing
circumstance
which
laid
hold
of
his
attention
this
was
no
less
than
the
appearance
on
his
own
little
platform
in
pairs
of
all
creation
on
its
way
into
his
own
particular
ark
the
elephant
leading
and
the
fly
with
a
diffident
sense
of
his
size
politely
bringing
up
the
rear
a
very
little
brother
lying
in
the
next
bed
with
a
broken
leg
was
so
enchanted
by
this
spectacle
that
his
delight
exalted
its
enthralling
interest
and
so
came
rest
and
sleep
see
you
are
not
afraid
to
leave
the
dear
child
here
betty
whispered
mrs
boffin
most
willingly
most
thankfully
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
so
they
kissed
him
and
left
him
there
and
old
betty
was
to
come
back
early
in
the
morning
and
nobody
but
rokesmith
knew
for
certain
how
that
the
doctor
had
said
should
have
been
days
ago
too
late
but
rokesmith
knowing
it
and
knowing
that
his
bearing
it
in
mind
would
be
acceptable
thereafter
to
that
good
woman
who
had
been
the
only
light
in
the
childhood
of
desolate
john
harmon
dead
and
gone
resolved
that
late
at
night
he
would
go
back
to
the
bedside
of
john
harmon
namesake
and
see
how
it
fared
with
him
the
family
whom
god
had
brought
together
were
not
all
asleep
but
were
all
quiet
from
bed
to
bed
a
light
womanly
tread
and
a
pleasant
fresh
face
passed
in
the
silence
of
the
night
a
little
head
would
lift
itself
up
into
the
softened
light
here
and
there
to
be
kissed
as
the
face
went
by
for
these
little
patients
are
very
loving
and
would
then
submit
itself
to
be
composed
to
rest
again
the
mite
with
the
broken
leg
was
restless
and
moaned
but
after
a
while
turned
his
face
towards
bed
to
fortify
himself
with
a
view
of
the
ark
and
fell
asleep
over
most
of
the
beds
the
toys
were
yet
grouped
as
the
children
had
left
them
when
they
last
laid
themselves
down
and
in
their
innocent
grotesqueness
and
incongruity
they
might
have
stood
for
the
dreams
the
doctor
came
in
too
to
see
how
it
fared
with
johnny
and
he
and
rokesmith
stood
together
looking
down
with
compassion
on
him
is
it
johnny
rokesmith
was
the
questioner
and
put
an
arm
round
the
poor
baby
as
he
made
a
struggle
said
the
little
fellow
the
doctor
was
quick
to
understand
children
and
taking
the
horse
the
ark
the
yellow
bird
and
the
man
in
the
guards
from
johnny
bed
softly
placed
them
on
that
of
his
next
neighbour
the
mite
with
the
broken
leg
with
a
weary
and
yet
a
pleased
smile
and
with
an
action
as
if
he
stretched
his
little
figure
out
to
rest
the
child
heaved
his
body
on
the
sustaining
arm
and
seeking
rokesmith
face
with
his
lips
said
kiss
for
the
boofer
lady
having
now
bequeathed
all
he
had
to
dispose
of
and
arranged
his
affairs
in
this
world
johnny
thus
speaking
left
it
chapter
a
successor
some
of
the
reverend
frank
milvey
brethren
had
found
themselves
exceedingly
uncomfortable
in
their
minds
because
they
were
required
to
bury
the
dead
too
hopefully
but
the
reverend
frank
inclining
to
the
belief
that
they
were
required
to
do
one
or
two
other
things
say
out
of
calculated
to
trouble
their
consciences
rather
more
if
they
would
think
as
much
about
them
held
his
peace
indeed
the
reverend
frank
milvey
was
a
forbearing
man
who
noticed
many
sad
warps
and
blights
in
the
vineyard
wherein
he
worked
and
did
not
profess
that
they
made
him
savagely
wise
he
only
learned
that
the
more
he
himself
knew
in
his
little
limited
human
way
the
better
he
could
distantly
imagine
what
omniscience
might
know
wherefore
if
the
reverend
frank
had
had
to
read
the
words
that
troubled
some
of
his
brethren
and
profitably
touched
innumerable
hearts
in
a
worse
case
than
johnny
he
would
have
done
so
out
of
the
pity
and
humility
of
his
soul
reading
them
over
johnny
he
thought
of
his
own
six
children
but
not
of
his
poverty
and
read
them
with
dimmed
eyes
and
very
seriously
did
he
and
his
bright
little
wife
who
had
been
listening
look
down
into
the
small
grave
and
walk
home
there
was
grief
in
the
aristocratic
house
and
there
was
joy
in
the
bower
mr
wegg
argued
if
an
orphan
were
wanted
was
he
not
an
orphan
himself
and
could
a
better
be
desired
and
why
go
beating
about
brentford
bushes
seeking
orphans
forsooth
who
had
established
no
claims
upon
you
and
made
no
sacrifices
for
you
when
here
was
an
orphan
ready
to
your
hand
who
had
given
up
in
your
cause
miss
elizabeth
master
george
aunt
jane
and
uncle
parker
mr
wegg
chuckled
consequently
when
he
heard
the
tidings
nay
it
was
afterwards
affirmed
by
a
witness
who
shall
at
present
be
nameless
that
in
the
seclusion
of
the
bower
he
poked
out
his
wooden
leg
in
the
manner
and
executed
a
taunting
or
triumphant
pirouette
on
the
genuine
leg
remaining
to
him
john
rokesmith
manner
towards
mrs
boffin
at
this
time
was
more
the
manner
of
a
young
man
towards
a
mother
than
that
of
a
secretary
towards
his
employer
wife
it
had
always
been
marked
by
a
subdued
affectionate
deference
that
seemed
to
have
sprung
up
on
the
very
day
of
his
engagement
whatever
was
odd
in
her
dress
or
her
ways
had
seemed
to
have
no
oddity
for
him
he
had
sometimes
borne
a
face
in
her
company
but
still
it
had
seemed
as
if
the
pleasure
her
genial
temper
and
radiant
nature
yielded
him
could
have
been
quite
as
naturally
expressed
in
a
tear
as
in
a
smile
the
completeness
of
his
sympathy
with
her
fancy
for
having
a
little
john
harmon
to
protect
and
rear
he
had
shown
in
every
act
and
word
and
now
that
the
kind
fancy
was
disappointed
he
treated
it
with
a
manly
tenderness
and
respect
for
which
she
could
hardly
thank
him
enough
i
do
thank
you
mr
rokesmith
said
mrs
boffin
i
thank
you
most
kindly
you
love
children
hope
everybody
does
ought
said
mrs
boffin
we
do
all
of
us
do
what
we
ought
do
us
john
rokesmith
replied
among
us
supply
the
of
the
rest
you
have
loved
children
well
mr
boffin
has
told
me
a
bit
better
than
he
has
but
that
his
way
he
puts
all
the
good
upon
me
you
speak
rather
sadly
mr
rokesmith
i
sounds
to
me
so
were
you
one
of
many
children
he
shook
his
head
only
child
there
was
another
dead
long
ago
or
mother
alive
the
rest
of
your
relations
if
i
ever
had
any
living
i
never
heard
of
any
at
this
point
of
the
dialogue
bella
came
in
with
a
light
step
she
paused
at
the
door
a
moment
hesitating
whether
to
remain
or
retire
perplexed
by
finding
that
she
was
not
observed
do
mind
an
old
lady
talk
said
mrs
boffin
tell
me
are
you
quite
sure
mr
rokesmith
that
you
have
never
had
a
disappointment
in
love
sure
why
do
you
ask
me
for
this
reason
sometimes
you
have
a
kind
of
manner
with
you
which
is
not
like
your
age
you
ca
be
thirty
am
not
yet
thirty
deeming
it
high
time
to
make
her
presence
known
bella
coughed
here
to
attract
attention
begged
pardon
and
said
she
would
go
fearing
that
she
interrupted
some
matter
of
business
do
go
rejoined
mrs
boffin
we
are
coming
to
business
instead
of
having
begun
it
and
you
belong
to
it
as
much
now
my
dear
bella
as
i
do
but
i
want
my
noddy
to
consult
with
us
would
somebody
be
so
good
as
find
my
noddy
for
me
rokesmith
departed
on
that
errand
and
presently
returned
accompanied
by
mr
boffin
at
his
bella
felt
a
little
vague
trepidation
as
to
the
of
this
same
consultation
until
mrs
boffin
announced
it
you
come
and
sit
by
me
my
dear
said
that
worthy
soul
taking
her
comfortable
place
on
a
large
ottoman
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
drawing
her
arm
through
bella
noddy
you
sit
here
and
mr
rokesmith
you
sit
there
now
you
see
what
i
want
to
talk
about
is
this
mr
and
mrs
milvey
have
sent
me
the
kindest
note
possible
which
mr
rokesmith
just
now
read
to
me
out
aloud
for
i
ai
good
at
handwritings
offering
to
find
me
another
little
child
to
name
and
educate
and
bring
up
well
this
has
set
me
thinking
she
is
a
at
it
murmured
mr
boffin
in
an
admiring
parenthesis
she
once
begins
it
may
be
so
easy
to
start
her
but
once
started
she
a
ingein
this
has
set
me
thinking
i
say
repeated
mrs
boffin
cordially
beaming
under
the
influence
of
her
husband
compliment
i
have
thought
two
things
first
of
all
that
i
have
grown
timid
of
reviving
john
harmon
name
it
an
unfortunate
name
and
i
fancy
i
should
reproach
myself
if
i
gave
it
to
another
dear
child
and
it
proved
again
unlucky
whether
said
mr
boffin
gravely
propounding
a
case
for
his
secretary
opinion
one
might
call
that
a
superstition
is
a
matter
of
feeling
with
mrs
boffin
said
rokesmith
gently
name
has
always
been
unfortunate
it
has
now
this
new
unfortunate
association
connected
with
it
the
name
has
died
out
why
revive
it
might
i
ask
miss
wilfer
what
she
thinks
has
not
been
a
fortunate
name
for
me
said
bella
colouring
at
least
it
was
not
until
it
led
to
my
being
here
but
that
is
not
the
point
in
my
thoughts
as
we
had
given
the
name
to
the
poor
child
and
as
the
poor
child
took
so
lovingly
to
me
i
think
i
should
feel
jealous
of
calling
another
child
by
it
i
think
i
should
feel
as
if
the
name
had
become
endeared
to
me
and
i
had
no
right
to
use
it
so
that
your
opinion
remarked
mr
boffin
observant
of
the
secretary
face
and
again
addressing
him
say
again
it
is
a
matter
of
feeling
returned
the
secretary
think
miss
wilfer
feeling
very
womanly
and
pretty
give
us
your
opinion
noddy
said
mrs
boffin
opinion
old
lady
returned
the
golden
dustman
your
opinion
said
mrs
boffin
agree
not
to
revive
john
harmon
name
but
to
let
it
rest
in
the
grave
it
is
as
mr
rokesmith
says
a
matter
of
feeling
but
lor
how
many
matters
are
matters
of
feeling
well
and
so
i
come
to
the
second
thing
i
have
thought
of
you
must
know
bella
my
dear
and
mr
rokesmith
that
when
i
first
named
to
my
husband
my
thoughts
of
adopting
a
little
orphan
boy
in
remembrance
of
john
harmon
i
further
named
to
my
husband
that
it
was
comforting
to
think
that
how
the
poor
boy
would
be
benefited
by
john
own
money
and
protected
from
john
own
forlornness
hear
cried
mr
boffin
she
did
ancoar
not
ancoar
noddy
my
dear
returned
mrs
boffin
i
am
going
to
say
something
else
i
meant
that
i
am
sure
as
much
as
i
still
mean
it
but
this
little
death
has
made
me
ask
myself
the
question
seriously
whether
i
was
too
bent
upon
pleasing
myself
else
why
did
i
seek
out
so
much
for
a
pretty
child
and
a
child
quite
to
my
liking
wanting
to
do
good
why
not
do
it
for
its
own
sake
and
put
my
tastes
and
likings
by
said
bella
and
perhaps
she
said
it
with
some
little
sensitiveness
arising
out
of
those
old
curious
relations
of
hers
towards
the
murdered
man
in
reviving
the
name
you
would
not
have
liked
to
give
it
to
a
less
interesting
child
than
the
original
he
interested
you
very
much
my
dear
returned
mrs
boffin
giving
her
a
squeeze
kind
of
you
to
find
that
reason
out
and
i
hope
it
may
have
been
so
and
indeed
to
a
certain
extent
i
believe
it
was
so
but
i
am
afraid
not
to
the
whole
extent
however
that
do
come
in
question
now
because
we
have
done
with
the
name
it
up
as
a
remembrance
suggested
bella
musingly
better
said
my
dear
laid
it
up
as
a
remembrance
well
then
i
have
been
thinking
if
i
take
any
orphan
to
provide
for
let
it
not
be
a
pet
and
a
plaything
for
me
but
a
creature
to
be
helped
for
its
own
sake
pretty
then
said
bella
returned
mrs
boffin
stoutly
prepossessing
then
said
bella
returned
mrs
boffin
necessarily
so
that
as
it
may
happen
a
boy
comes
in
my
way
who
may
be
even
a
little
wanting
in
such
advantages
for
getting
on
in
life
but
is
honest
and
industrious
and
requires
a
helping
hand
and
deserves
it
if
i
am
very
much
in
earnest
and
quite
determined
to
be
unselfish
let
me
take
care
of
him
here
the
footman
whose
feelings
had
been
hurt
on
the
former
occasion
appeared
and
crossing
to
rokesmith
apologetically
announced
the
objectionable
sloppy
the
four
members
of
council
looked
at
one
another
and
paused
he
be
brought
here
asked
rokesmith
said
mrs
boffin
whereupon
the
footman
disappeared
reappeared
presenting
sloppy
and
retired
much
disgusted
the
consideration
of
mrs
boffin
had
clothed
mr
sloppy
in
a
suit
of
black
on
which
the
tailor
had
received
personal
directions
from
rokesmith
to
expend
the
utmost
cunning
of
his
art
with
a
view
to
the
concealment
of
the
cohering
and
sustaining
buttons
but
so
much
more
powerful
were
the
frailties
of
sloppy
form
than
the
strongest
resources
of
tailoring
science
that
he
now
stood
before
the
council
a
perfect
argus
in
the
way
of
buttons
shining
and
winking
and
gleaming
and
twinkling
out
of
a
hundred
of
those
eyes
of
bright
metal
at
the
dazzled
spectators
the
artistic
taste
of
some
unknown
hatter
had
furnished
him
with
a
hatband
of
wholesale
capacity
which
was
fluted
behind
from
the
crown
of
his
hat
to
the
brim
and
terminated
in
a
black
bunch
from
which
the
imagination
shrunk
discomfited
and
the
reason
revolted
some
special
powers
with
which
his
legs
were
endowed
had
already
hitched
up
his
glossy
trousers
at
the
ankles
and
bagged
them
at
the
knees
while
similar
gifts
in
his
arms
had
raised
his
from
his
wrists
and
accumulated
them
at
his
elbows
thus
set
forth
with
the
additional
embellishments
of
a
very
little
tail
to
his
coat
and
a
yawning
gulf
at
his
waistband
sloppy
stood
confessed
how
is
betty
my
good
fellow
mrs
boffin
asked
him
mum
said
sloppy
do
pretty
nicely
and
sending
her
dooty
and
many
thanks
for
the
tea
and
all
faviours
and
wishing
to
know
the
family
healths
you
just
come
sloppy
mum
you
have
not
had
your
dinner
yet
mum
but
i
mean
to
it
for
i
ai
forgotten
your
handsome
orders
that
i
was
never
to
go
away
without
having
had
a
good
off
of
meat
and
beer
and
pudding
no
there

four
of
for

reckoned
up
when
i
had
meat
one
beer
two
vegetables
three
and
which
was
four
why
pudding
he
was
four
here
sloppy
threw
his
head
back
opened
his
mouth
wide
and
laughed
rapturously
are
the
two
poor
little
minders
asked
mrs
boffin
right
out
mum
and
coming
round
beautiful
mrs
boffin
looked
on
the
other
three
members
of
council
and
then
said
beckoning
with
her
finger
mum
forward
sloppy
should
you
like
to
dine
here
every
day
of
all
four
on
mum
o
mum
sloppy
feelings
obliged
him
to
squeeze
his
hat
and
contract
one
leg
at
the
knee
and
should
you
like
to
be
always
taken
care
of
here
if
you
were
industrious
and
deserving
mum
but
there
mrs
higden
said
sloppy
checking
himself
in
his
raptures
drawing
back
and
shaking
his
head
with
very
serious
meaning
mrs
higden
mrs
higden
goes
before
all
none
can
ever
be
better
friends
to
me
than
mrs
higden
been
and
she
must
be
turned
for
must
mrs
higden
where
would
mrs
higden
be
if
she
war
turned
for
at
the
mere
thought
of
mrs
higden
in
this
inconceivable
affliction
mr
countenance
became
pale
and
manifested
the
most
distressful
emotions
are
as
right
as
right
can
be
sloppy
said
mrs
boffin
far
be
it
from
me
to
tell
you
otherwise
it
shall
be
seen
to
if
betty
higden
can
be
turned
for
all
the
same
you
shall
come
here
and
be
taken
care
of
for
life
and
be
made
able
to
keep
her
in
other
ways
than
the
turning
as
to
that
mum
answered
the
ecstatic
sloppy
turning
might
be
done
in
the
night
do
you
see
i
could
be
here
in
the
day
and
turn
in
the
night
i
do
want
no
sleep
i
do
or
even
if
i
any
ways
should
want
a
wink
or
two
added
sloppy
after
a
moment
apologetic
reflection
could
take
turning
i
took
turning
many
a
time
and
enjoyed
wonderful
on
the
grateful
impulse
of
the
moment
mr
sloppy
kissed
mrs
hand
and
then
detaching
himself
from
that
good
creature
that
he
might
have
room
enough
for
his
feelings
threw
back
his
head
opened
his
mouth
wide
and
uttered
a
dismal
howl
it
was
creditable
to
his
tenderness
of
heart
but
suggested
that
he
might
on
occasion
give
some
offence
to
the
neighbours
the
rather
as
the
footman
looked
in
and
begged
pardon
finding
he
was
not
wanted
but
excused
himself
on
the
ground
he
thought
it
was
cats

affairs
of
the
heart
little
miss
peecher

her
little
official

its
little
windows

and
its
little
doors

of

vigilant
watchman
and
miss
peecher
kept
him
on
double
duty
over
mr
bradley
headstone
it
was
not
that
she
was
naturally
given
to
playing
the
spy
it
was
not
that
she
was
at
all
secret
plotting
or
mean
it
was
simply
that
she
loved
the
irresponsive
bradley
with
all
the
primitive
and
homely
stock
of
love
that
had
never
been
examined
or
certificated
out
of
her
if
her
faithful
slate
had
had
the
latent
qualities
of
sympathetic
paper

its
pencil

of

ink

little
treatise
calculated
to
astonish

pupils

bursting
through

dry
sums

influence

was
not

calm

the
confidential
slate
an
imaginary
description
of
how
upon
a
balmy
evening
at
dusk
two
figures
might
have
been
observed
in
the
ground
round
the
corner
of
whom
one
being
a
manly
form
bent
over
the
other
being
a
womanly
form
of
short
stature
and
some
compactness
and
breathed
in
a
low
voice
the
words
peecher
wilt
thou
be
my
own
after
which
the
womanly
form
head
reposed
upon
the
manly
form
shoulder
and
the
nightingales
tuned
up
though
all
unseen
and
unsuspected
by
the
pupils
bradley
headstone
even
pervaded
the
school
exercises
was
geography
in
question
he
would
come
triumphantly
flying
out
of
vesuvius
and
aetna
ahead
of
the
lava
and
would
boil
unharmed
in
the
hot
springs
of
iceland
and
would
float
majestically
down
the
ganges
and
the
nile
did

chronicle
a
king
of
men
behold
him
in
pantaloons
with
his
round
his
neck
were
copies
to
be
written
in
capital
b
and
h
most
of
the
girls
under
miss
peecher
tuition
were
half
a
year
ahead
of
every
other
letter
in
the
alphabet
and
mental
arithmetic
administered
by
miss
peecher
often
devoted
itself
to
providing
bradley
headstone
with
a
wardrobe
of
fabulous
extent
fourscore
and
four
at
two
and
two
gross
of
silver
watches
at
four
pounds
fifteen
and
sixpence
black
hats
at
eighteen
shillings
and
many
similar
superfluities
the
vigilant
watchman
using
his
daily
opportunities
of
turning
his
eyes
in
bradley
direction
soon
apprized
miss
peecher
that
bradley
was
more
preoccupied
than
had
been
his
wont
and
more
given
to
strolling
about
with
a
downcast
and
reserved
face
turning
something
difficult
in
his
mind
that
was
not
in
the
scholastic
syllabus
putting
this
and
that
together
combining
under
the
head
present
appearances
and
the
intimacy
with
charley
hexam
and
ranging
under
the
head
the
visit
to
his
sister
the
watchman
reported
to
miss
peecher
his
strong
suspicions
that
the
sister
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
wonder
said
miss
peecher
as
she
sat
making
up
her
weekly
report
on
a
afternoon
they
call
hexam
sister
mary
anne
at
her
needlework
attendant
and
attentive
held
her
arm
up
mary
anne
is
named
lizzie
can
hardly
be
named
lizzie
i
think
mary
anne
returned
miss
peecher
in
a
tunefully
instructive
voice
lizzie
a
christian
name
mary
anne
mary
anne
laid
down
her
work
rose
hooked
herself
behind
as
being
under
catechization
and
replied
it
is
a
corruption
miss
peecher
gave
her
that
name
miss
peecher
was
going
on
from
the
mere
force
of
habit
when
she
checked
herself
on
mary
anne
evincing
theological
impatience
to
strike
in
with
her
godfathers
and
her
godmothers
and
said
mean
of
what
name
is
it
a
corruption
or
eliza
miss
peecher
mary
anne
whether
there
were
any
lizzies
in
the
early
christian
church
must
be
considered
very
doubtful
very
doubtful
miss
peecher
was
exceedingly
sage
here
correctly
we
say
then
that
hexam
sister
is
called
lizzie
not
that
she
is
named
so
do
we
not
mary
anne
do
miss
peecher
where
pursued
miss
peecher
complacent
in
her
little
transparent
fiction
of
conducting
the
examination
in
a
semiofficial
manner
for
mary
anne
benefit
not
her
own
does
this
young
woman
who
is
called
but
not
named
lizzie
live
think
now
before
answering
church
street
smith
square
by
mill
bank
church
street
smith
square
by

repeated
miss
peecher
as
if
possessed
beforehand
of
the
book
in
which
it
was
written
exactly
so
and
what
occupation
does
this
young
woman
pursue
mary
anne
take
time
has
a
place
of
trust
at
an
outfitter
in
the
city
said
miss
peecher
pondering
on
it
but
smoothly
added
in
a
confirmatory
tone
an
outfitter
in
the
city
charley
mary
anne
was
proceeding
when
miss
peecher
stared
mean
hexam
miss
peecher
should
think
you
did
mary
anne
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
do
and
hexam
mary
anne
went
on
he
is
not
pleased
with
his
sister
and
that
his
sister
wo
be
guided
by
his
advice
and
persists
in
being
guided
by
somebody
else
and
that
headstone
coming
across
the
garden
exclaimed
miss
peecher
with
a
flushed
glance
at
the
have
answered
very
well
mary
anne
you
are
forming
an
excellent
habit
of
arranging
your
thoughts
clearly
that
will
do
the
discreet
mary
anne
resumed
her
seat
and
her
silence
and
stitched
and
stitched
and
was
stitching
when
the
schoolmaster
shadow
came
in
before
him
announcing
that
he
might
be
instantly
expected
evening
miss
peecher
he
said
pursuing
the
shadow
and
taking
its
place
evening
mr
headstone
mary
anne
a
chair
you
said
bradley
seating
himself
in
his
constrained
manner
is
but
a
flying
visit
i
have
looked
in
on
my
way
to
ask
a
kindness
of
you
as
a
neighbour
you
say
on
your
way
mr
headstone
asked
miss
peecher
my
way
to
where
i
am
going
street
smith
square
by
mill
bank
repeated
miss
peecher
in
her
own
thoughts
hexam
has
gone
to
get
a
book
or
two
he
wants
and
will
probably
be
back
before
me
as
we
leave
my
house
empty
i
took
the
liberty
of
telling
him
i
would
leave
the
key
here
would
you
kindly
allow
me
to
do
so
mr
headstone
going
for
an
evening
walk
sir
for
a
walk
and
partly
for
on
business
in
church
street
smith
square
by
mill
bank
repeated
miss
peecher
to
herself
said
which
pursued
bradley
laying
his
on
the
table
must
be
already
going
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
for
you
miss
peecher
you
mr
headstone
in
which
direction
the
direction
of
westminster
bank
miss
peecher
repeated
in
her
own
thoughts
once
again
thank
you
mr
headstone
i
not
trouble
you
could
trouble
me
said
the
schoolmaster
returned
miss
peecher
though
not
aloud
you
can
trouble
me
and
for
all
her
quiet
manner
and
her
quiet
smile
she
was
full
of
trouble
as
he
went
his
way
she
was
right
touching
his
destination
he
held
as
straight
a
course
for
the
house
of
the
dolls
dressmaker
as
the
wisdom
of
his
ancestors
exemplified
in
the
construction
of
the
intervening
streets
would
let
him
and
walked
with
a
bent
head
hammering
at
one
fixed
idea
it
had
been
an
immoveable
idea
since
he
first
set
eyes
upon
her
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
all
that
he
could
suppress
in
himself
he
had
suppressed
as
if
all
that
he
could
restrain
in
himself
he
had
restrained
and
the
time
had
come
in
a
rush
in
a
moment
when
the
power
of
had
departed
from
him
love
at
first
sight
is
a
trite
expression
quite
sufficiently
discussed
enough
that
in
certain
smouldering
natures
like
this
man
that
passion
leaps
into
a
blaze
and
makes
such
head
as
fire
does
in
a
rage
of
wind
when
other
passions
but
for
its
mastery
could
be
held
in
chains
as
a
multitude
of
weak
imitative
natures
are
always
lying
by
ready
to
go
mad
upon
the
next
wrong
idea
that
may
be
broached
in
these
times
generally
some
form
of
tribute
to
somebody
for
something
that
never
was
done
or
if
ever
done
that
was
done
by
somebody
else
so
these
less
ordinary
natures
may
lie
by
for
years
ready
on
the
touch
of
an
instant
to
burst
into
flame
the
schoolmaster
went
his
way
brooding
and
brooding
and
a
sense
of
being
vanquished
in
a
struggle
might
have
been
pieced
out
of
his
worried
face
truly
in
his
breast
there
lingered
a
resentful
shame
to
find
himself
defeated
by
this
passion
for
charley
hexam
sister
though
in
the
very
moments
he
was
concentrating
himself
upon
the
object
of
bringing
the
passion
to
a
successful
issue
he
appeared
before
the
dolls
dressmaker
sitting
alone
at
her
work
thought
that
sharp
young
personage
you
is
it
i
know
your
tricks
and
your
manners
my
friend
sister
said
bradley
headstone
not
come
home
yet
are
quite
a
conjuror
returned
miss
wren
will
wait
if
you
please
for
i
want
to
speak
to
her
you
returned
miss
wren
down
i
hope
it
mutual
bradley
glanced
distrustfully
at
the
shrewd
face
again
bending
over
the
work
and
said
trying
to
conquer
doubt
and
hesitation
hope
you
do
imply
that
my
visit
will
be
unacceptable
to
sister
do
call
her
that
i
ca
bear
you
to
call
her
that
returned
miss
wren
snapping
her
fingers
in
a
volley
of
impatient
snaps
i
do
like
hexam
miss
wren
wrinkled
her
nose
to
express
dislike
thinks
only
of
himself
the
way
with
all
of
you
way
with
all
of
us
then
you
do
like
me
replied
miss
wren
with
a
shrug
and
a
laugh
know
much
about
you
i
was
not
aware
it
was
the
way
with
all
of
us
said
bradley
returning
to
the
accusation
a
little
injured
you
say
some
of
us
returned
the
little
creature
one
of
you
but
you
hah
now
look
this
lady
in
the
face
this
is
mrs
truth
the
honourable
bradley
glanced
at
the
doll
she
held
up
for
his
observation
which
had
been
lying
on
its
face
on
her
bench
while
with
a
needle
and
thread
she
fastened
the
dress
on
at
the
back
and
looked
from
it
to
her
stand
the
honourable
mrs
on
my
bench
in
this
corner
against
the
wall
where
her
blue
eyes
can
shine
upon
you
pursued
miss
wren
doing
so
and
making
two
little
dabs
at
him
in
the
air
with
her
needle
as
if
she
pricked
him
with
it
in
his
own
eyes
i
defy
you
to
tell
me
with
mrs
for
a
witness
what
you
have
come
here
for
see
hexam
sister
do
say
so
retorted
miss
wren
hitching
her
chin
on
whose
account
own
mrs
exclaimed
miss
wren
hear
him
reason
with
her
pursued
bradley
half
humouring
what
was
present
and
half
angry
with
what
was
not
present
her
own
sake
mrs
exclaimed
the
dressmaker
her
own
sake
repeated
bradley
warming
for
her
brother
and
as
a
perfectly
disinterested
person
mrs
remarked
the
dressmaker
it
comes
to
this
we
must
positively
turn
you
with
your
face
to
the
wall
she
had
hardly
done
so
when
lizzie
hexam
arrived
and
showed
some
surprise
on
seeing
bradley
headstone
there
and
jenny
shaking
her
little
fist
at
him
close
before
her
eyes
and
the
honourable
mrs
with
her
face
to
the
wall
a
perfectly
disinterested
person
lizzie
dear
said
the
knowing
miss
wren
to
talk
with
you
for
your
own
sake
and
your
brother
think
of
that
i
am
sure
there
ought
to
be
no
third
party
present
at
anything
so
very
kind
and
so
very
serious
and
so
if
you
remove
the
third
party
upstairs
my
dear
the
third
party
will
retire
lizzie
took
the
hand
which
the
dolls
dressmaker
held
out
to
her
for
the
purpose
of
being
supported
away
but
only
looked
at
her
with
an
inquiring
smile
and
made
no
other
movement
third
party
hobbles
awfully
you
know
when
she
left
to
herself
said
miss
wren
back
being
so
bad
and
her
legs
so
queer
so
she
ca
retire
gracefully
unless
you
help
her
lizzie
can
do
no
better
than
stay
where
she
is
returned
lizzie
releasing
the
hand
and
laying
her
own
lightly
on
miss
jenny
curls
and
then
to
bradley
charley
sir
in
an
irresolute
way
and
stealing
a
clumsy
look
at
her
bradley
rose
to
place
a
chair
for
her
and
then
returned
to
his
own
speaking
said
he
come
from
charley
because
i
left
him
only
a
little
while
ago
but
i
am
not
commissioned
by
charley
i
come
of
my
own
spontaneous
act
with
her
elbows
on
her
bench
and
her
chin
upon
her
hands
miss
jenny
wren
sat
looking
at
him
with
a
watchful
sidelong
look
lizzie
in
her
different
way
sat
looking
at
him
too
fact
is
began
bradley
with
a
mouth
so
dry
that
he
had
some
difficulty
in
articulating
his
words
the
consciousness
of
which
rendered
his
manner
still
more
ungainly
and
undecided
truth
is
that
charley
having
no
secrets
from
me
to
the
best
of
my
belief
has
confided
the
whole
of
this
matter
to
me
he
came
to
a
stop
and
lizzie
asked
matter
sir
thought
returned
the
schoolmaster
stealing
another
look
at
her
and
seeming
to
try
in
vain
to
sustain
it
for
the
look
dropped
as
it
lighted
on
her
eyes
it
might
be
so
superfluous
as
to
be
almost
impertinent
to
enter
upon
a
definition
of
it
my
allusion
was
to
this
matter
of
your
having
put
aside
your
brother
plans
for
you
and
given
the
preference
to
those
of
mr
i
believe
the
name
is
mr
eugene
wrayburn
he
made
this
point
of
not
being
certain
of
the
name
with
another
uneasy
look
at
her
which
dropped
like
the
last
nothing
being
said
on
the
other
side
he
had
to
begin
again
and
began
with
new
embarrassment
brother
plans
were
communicated
to
me
when
he
first
had
them
in
his
thoughts
in
point
of
fact
he
spoke
to
me
about
them
when
i
was
last
here
when
we
were
walking
back
together
and
when
i
when
the
impression
was
fresh
upon
me
of
having
seen
his
sister
there
might
have
been
no
meaning
in
it
but
the
little
dressmaker
here
removed
one
of
her
supporting
hands
from
her
chin
and
musingly
turned
the
honourable
mrs
with
her
face
to
the
company
that
done
she
fell
into
her
former
attitude
approved
of
his
idea
said
bradley
with
his
uneasy
look
wandering
to
the
doll
and
unconsciously
resting
there
longer
than
it
had
rested
on
lizzie
because
your
brother
ought
naturally
to
be
the
originator
of
any
such
scheme
and
because
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
promote
it
i
should
have
had
inexpressible
pleasure
i
should
have
taken
inexpressible
interest
in
promoting
it
therefore
i
must
acknowledge
that
when
your
brother
was
disappointed
i
too
was
disappointed
i
wish
to
avoid
reservation
or
concealment
and
i
fully
acknowledge
that
he
appeared
to
have
encouraged
himself
by
having
got
so
far
at
all
events
he
went
on
with
much
greater
firmness
and
force
of
emphasis
though
with
a
curious
disposition
to
set
his
teeth
and
with
a
curious
movement
of
his
right
hand
in
the
clenching
palm
of
his
left
like
the
action
of
one
who
was
being
physically
hurt
and
was
unwilling
to
cry
out
am
a
man
of
strong
feelings
and
i
have
strongly
felt
this
disappointment
i
do
strongly
feel
it
i
do
show
what
i
feel
some
of
us
are
obliged
habitually
to
keep
it
down
to
keep
it
down
but
to
return
to
your
brother
he
has
taken
the
matter
so
much
to
heart
that
he
has
remonstrated
in
my
presence
he
remonstrated
with
mr
eugene
wrayburn
if
that
be
the
name
he
did
so
quite
ineffectually
as
any
one
not
blinded
to
the
real
character
of
mr
mr
eugene
wrayburn
would
readily
suppose
he
looked
at
lizzie
again
and
held
the
look
and
his
face
turned
from
burning
red
to
white
and
from
white
back
to
burning
red
and
so
for
the
time
to
lasting
deadly
white
i
resolved
to
come
here
alone
and
appeal
to
you
i
resolved
to
come
here
alone
and
entreat
you
to
retract
the
course
you
have
chosen
and
instead
of
confiding
in
a
mere
stranger
a
person
of
most
insolent
behaviour
to
your
brother
and
others
to
prefer
your
brother
and
your
brother
friend
lizzie
hexam
had
changed
colour
when
those
changes
came
over
him
and
her
face
now
expressed
some
anger
more
dislike
and
even
a
touch
of
fear
but
she
answered
him
very
steadily
can
not
doubt
mr
headstone
that
your
visit
is
well
meant
you
have
been
so
good
a
friend
to
charley
that
i
have
no
right
to
doubt
it
i
have
nothing
to
tell
charley
but
that
i
accepted
the
help
to
which
he
so
much
objects
before
he
made
any
plans
for
me
or
certainly
before
i
knew
of
any
it
was
considerately
and
delicately
offered
and
there
were
reasons
that
had
weight
with
me
which
should
be
as
dear
to
charley
as
to
me
i
have
no
more
to
say
to
charley
on
this
subject
his
lips
trembled
and
stood
apart
as
he
followed
this
repudiation
of
himself
and
limitation
of
her
words
to
her
brother
should
have
told
charley
if
he
had
come
to
me
she
resumed
as
though
it
were
an
jenny
and
i
find
our
teacher
very
able
and
very
patient
and
that
she
takes
great
pains
with
us
so
much
so
that
we
have
said
to
her
we
hope
in
a
very
little
while
to
be
able
to
go
on
by
ourselves
charley
knows
about
teachers
and
i
should
also
have
told
him
for
his
satisfaction
that
ours
comes
from
an
institution
where
teachers
are
regularly
brought
up
should
like
to
ask
you
said
bradley
headstone
grinding
his
words
slowly
out
as
though
they
came
from
a
rusty
mill
should
like
to
ask
you
if
i
may
without
offence
whether
you
would
have
objected
no
rather
i
should
like
to
say
if
i
may
without
offence
that
i
wish
i
had
had
the
opportunity
of
coming
here
with
your
brother
and
devoting
my
poor
abilities
and
experience
to
your
service
you
mr
headstone
i
fear
he
pursued
after
a
pause
furtively
wrenching
at
the
seat
of
his
chair
with
one
hand
as
if
he
would
have
wrenched
the
chair
to
pieces
and
gloomily
observing
her
while
her
eyes
were
cast
down
my
humble
services
would
not
have
found
much
favour
with
you
she
made
no
reply
and
the
poor
stricken
wretch
sat
contending
with
himself
in
a
heat
of
passion
and
torment
after
a
while
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
forehead
and
hands
is
only
one
thing
more
i
had
to
say
but
it
is
the
most
important
there
is
a
reason
against
this
matter
there
is
a
personal
relation
concerned
in
this
matter
not
yet
explained
to
you
it
might
i
do
say
it
would
it
might
induce
you
to
think
differently
to
proceed
under
the
present
circumstances
is
out
of
the
question
will
you
please
come
to
the
understanding
that
there
shall
be
another
interview
on
the
subject
charley
mr
headstone
well
he
answered
breaking
off
say
with
him
too
will
you
please
come
to
the
understanding
that
there
must
be
another
interview
under
more
favourable
circumstances
before
the
whole
case
can
be
submitted
do
said
lizzie
shaking
her
head
your
meaning
mr
headstone
my
meaning
for
the
present
he
interrupted
the
whole
case
being
submitted
to
you
in
another
interview
case
mr
headstone
what
is
wanting
to
it
you
shall
be
informed
in
the
other
interview
then
he
said
as
if
in
a
burst
of
irrepressible
despair
i
leave
it
all
incomplete
there
is
a
spell
upon
me
i
think
and
then
added
almost
as
if
he
asked
for
pity
he
held
out
his
hand
as
she
with
manifest
hesitation
not
to
say
reluctance
touched
it
a
strange
tremble
passed
over
him
and
his
face
so
deadly
white
was
moved
as
by
a
stroke
of
pain
then
he
was
gone
the
dolls
dressmaker
sat
with
her
attitude
unchanged
eyeing
the
door
by
which
he
had
departed
until
lizzie
pushed
her
bench
aside
and
sat
down
near
her
then
eyeing
lizzie
as
she
had
previously
eyed
bradley
and
the
door
miss
wren
chopped
that
very
sudden
and
keen
chop
in
which
her
jaws
sometimes
indulged
leaned
back
in
her
chair
with
folded
arms
and
thus
expressed
herself
if
he
i
mean
of
course
my
dear
the
party
who
is
coming
to
court
me
when
the
time
comes
should
be
that
sort
of
man
he
may
spare
himself
the
trouble
he
would
do
to
be
trotted
about
and
made
useful
he
take
fire
and
blow
up
while
he
was
about
it
so
you
would
be
rid
of
him
said
lizzie
humouring
her
so
easily
returned
miss
wren
would
blow
up
alone
carry
me
up
with
him
i
know
his
tricks
and
his
manners
he
want
to
hurt
you
do
you
mean
asked
lizzie
exactly
want
to
do
it
my
dear
returned
miss
wren
a
lot
of
gunpowder
among
lighted
in
the
next
room
might
almost
as
well
be
here
is
a
very
strange
man
said
lizzie
thoughtfully
wish
he
was
so
very
strange
a
man
as
to
be
a
total
stranger
answered
the
sharp
little
thing
it
being
lizzie
regular
occupation
when
they
were
alone
of
an
evening
to
brush
out
and
smooth
the
long
fair
hair
of
the
dolls
dressmaker
she
unfastened
a
ribbon
that
kept
it
back
while
the
little
creature
was
at
her
work
and
it
fell
in
a
beautiful
shower
over
the
poor
shoulders
that
were
much
in
need
of
such
adorning
rain
now
lizzie
dear
said
jenny
us
have
a
talk
by
the
fire
with
those
words
she
in
her
turn
loosened
her
friend
dark
hair
and
it
dropped
of
its
own
weight
over
her
bosom
in
two
rich
masses
pretending
to
compare
the
colours
and
admire
the
contrast
jenny
so
managed
a
mere
touch
or
two
of
her
nimble
hands
as
that
she
herself
laying
a
cheek
on
one
of
the
dark
folds
seemed
blinded
by
her
own
clustering
curls
to
all
but
the
fire
while
the
fine
handsome
face
and
brow
of
lizzie
were
revealed
without
obstruction
in
the
sombre
light
us
have
a
talk
said
jenny
mr
eugene
wrayburn
something
sparkled
down
among
the
fair
hair
resting
on
the
dark
hair
and
if
it
were
not
a
star
which
it
could
be
it
was
an
eye
and
if
it
were
an
eye
it
was
jenny
wren
eye
bright
and
watchful
as
the
bird
whose
name
she
had
taken
about
mr
wrayburn
lizzie
asked
no
better
reason
than
because
i
in
the
humour
i
wonder
whether
he
rich
not
rich
think
so
for
a
gentleman
to
be
sure
yes
he
a
gentleman
not
of
our
sort
is
he
a
shake
of
the
head
a
thoughtful
shake
of
the
head
and
the
answer
softly
spoken
no
oh
no
the
dolls
dressmaker
had
an
arm
round
her
friend
waist
adjusting
the
arm
she
slyly
took
the
opportunity
of
blowing
at
her
own
hair
where
it
fell
over
her
face
then
the
eye
down
there
under
lighter
shadows
sparkled
more
brightly
and
appeared
more
watchful
he
turns
up
he
sha
be
a
gentleman
i
very
soon
send
him
packing
if
he
is
however
he
not
mr
wrayburn
i
have
captivated
him
i
wonder
whether
anybody
has
lizzie
is
very
likely
it
very
likely
i
wonder
who
it
not
very
likely
that
some
lady
has
been
taken
by
him
and
that
he
may
love
her
dearly
i
do
know
what
would
you
think
of
him
lizzie
if
you
were
a
lady
a
lady
she
repeated
laughing
a
fancy
but
say
just
as
a
fancy
and
for
instance
a
lady
i
a
poor
girl
who
used
to
row
poor
father
on
the
river
i
who
had
rowed
poor
father
out
and
home
on
the
very
night
when
i
saw
him
for
the
first
time
i
who
was
made
so
timid
by
his
looking
at
me
that
i
got
up
and
went
out
did
look
at
you
even
that
night
though
you
were
not
a
lady
thought
miss
wren
a
lady
lizzie
went
on
in
a
low
voice
with
her
eyes
upon
the
fire
with
poor
father
grave
not
even
cleared
of
undeserved
stain
and
shame
and
he
trying
to
clear
it
for
me
i
a
lady
as
a
fancy
and
for
instance
urged
miss
wren
much
jenny
dear
too
much
my
fancy
is
not
able
to
get
that
far
as
the
low
fire
gleamed
upon
her
it
showed
her
smiling
mournfully
and
abstractedly
i
am
in
the
humour
and
i
must
be
humoured
lizzie
because
after
all
i
am
a
poor
little
thing
and
have
had
a
hard
day
with
my
bad
child
look
in
the
fire
as
i
like
to
hear
you
tell
how
you
used
to
do
when
you
lived
in
that
dreary
old
house
that
had
once
been
a
windmill
look
in
the
what
was
its
name
when
you
told
fortunes
with
your
brother
that
i
do
like
hollow
down
by
the
flare
that
the
name
you
can
find
a
lady
there
i
know
easily
than
i
can
make
one
of
such
material
as
myself
jenny
the
sparkling
eye
looked
steadfastly
up
as
the
musing
face
looked
thoughtfully
down
said
the
dolls
dressmaker
have
found
our
lady
lizzie
nodded
and
asked
she
be
rich
had
better
be
as
he
poor
is
very
rich
shall
she
be
handsome
you
can
be
that
lizzie
so
she
ought
to
be
is
very
handsome
does
she
say
about
him
asked
miss
jenny
in
a
low
voice
watchful
through
an
intervening
silence
of
the
face
looking
down
at
the
fire
is
glad
glad
to
be
rich
that
he
may
have
the
money
she
is
glad
glad
to
be
beautiful
that
he
may
be
proud
of
her
her
poor
heart
her
poor
heart
said
miss
wren
heart
is
given
him
with
all
its
love
and
truth
she
would
joyfully
die
with
him
or
better
than
that
die
for
him
she
knows
he
has
failings
but
she
thinks
they
have
grown
up
through
his
being
like
one
cast
away
for
the
want
of
something
to
trust
in
and
care
for
and
think
well
of
and
she
says
that
lady
rich
and
beautiful
that
i
can
never
come
near
only
put
me
in
that
empty
place
only
try
how
little
i
mind
myself
only
prove
what
a
world
of
things
i
will
do
and
bear
for
you
and
i
hope
that
you
might
even
come
to
be
much
better
than
you
are
through
me
who
am
so
much
worse
and
hardly
worth
the
thinking
of
beside
as
the
face
looking
at
the
fire
had
become
exalted
and
forgetful
in
the
rapture
of
these
words
the
little
creature
openly
clearing
away
her
fair
hair
with
her
disengaged
hand
had
gazed
at
it
with
earnest
attention
and
something
like
alarm
now
that
the
speaker
ceased
the
little
creature
laid
down
her
head
again
and
moaned
me
o
me
o
me
pain
dear
jenny
asked
lizzie
as
if
awakened
but
not
the
old
pain
lay
me
down
lay
me
down
do
go
out
of
my
sight
lock
the
door
and
keep
close
to
me
then
turning
away
her
face
she
said
in
a
whisper
to
herself
lizzie
my
poor
lizzie
o
my
blessed
children
come
back
in
the
long
bright
slanting
rows
and
come
for
her
not
me
she
wants
help
more
than
i
my
blessed
children
she
had
stretched
her
hands
up
with
that
higher
and
better
look
and
now
she
turned
again
and
folded
them
round
lizzie
neck
and
rocked
herself
on
lizzie
breast

worse
the
hole
albeit
in
a
general
way
not
over
nice
in
its
choice
of
company
was
rather
shy
in
reference
to
the
honour
of
cultivating
the
rogue
acquaintance
more
frequently
giving
him
the
cold
shoulder
than
the
warm
hand
and
seldom

never
drinking
with
him
unless
at
his
own
expense
a
part
of

indeed
contained
so
much
public
spirit
and
private
virtue
that
not
even
this
strong
leverage
could
move
it
to
good
fellowship
with
a
tainted
accuser
but
there
may
have
been
the
drawback
on
this

that
its

a
false
one
had
it
not
been
for
the

whom
he
often
mentioned
mr
riderhood
might
have
found
the

a
mere
grave
as
to
any
means
it
would
yield
him
of
getting

had
some
little
position
and
connection
in
limehouse

upon
the

of

she
was

pawnbroker
keeping
what
was
popularly
called
a

by
lending
insignificant
sums
on
insignificant
articles
of
property
deposited
with

as

in

of

pleasant
was
already
in
her
fifth
year
of
this
way
of
trade
her
deceased
mother
had
established
the
business
and
on
that
parent
demise
she
had
appropriated
a
secret
capital
of
fifteen
shillings
to
establishing
herself
in
it
the
existence
of
such
capital
in
a

being
the

communication
made
to

by

departed
before
succumbing
to
dropsical
conditions
of
snuff
and

incompatible
equally
with
coherence
and
existence
why
christened
pleasant
the
late
mrs
riderhood
might
possibly
have
been
at
some
time
able
to
explain
and
possibly
not
her
daughter
had
no
information
on
that
point
pleasant
she
found
herself
and
she
help
it
she
had
not
been
consulted
on
the
question
any
more
than
on
the
question
of
her
coming
into
these
terrestrial
parts
to
want
a
name
similarly
she
found
herself
possessed
of
what
is
colloquially
termed
a
swivel
eye
derived
from
her
father
which
she
might
perhaps
have
declined
if
her
sentiments
on
the
subject
had
been
taken
she
was
not
otherwise
positively
though
anxious
meagre
of
a
muddy
complexion
and
looking
as
old
again
as
she
really
was
as
some
dogs
have
it
in
the
blood
or
are
trained
to
worry
certain
creatures
to
a
certain
point
so
not
to
make
the
comparison
disrespectfully
pleasant
riderhood
had
it
in
the
blood
or
had
been
trained
to
regard
seamen
within
certain
limits
as
her
prey
show
her
a
man
in
a
blue
jacket
and
figuratively
speaking
she
pinned
him
instantly
yet
all
things
considered
she
was
not
of
an
evil
mind
or
an
unkindly
disposition
for
observe
how
many
things
were
to
be
considered
according
to
her
own
unfortunate
experience
show
pleasant
riderhood
a
wedding
in
the
street
and
she
only
saw
two
people
taking
out
a
regular
licence
to
quarrel
and
fight
show
her
a
christening
and
she
saw
a
little
heathen
personage
having
a
quite
superfluous
name
bestowed
upon
it
inasmuch
as
it
would
be
commonly
addressed
by
some
abusive
epithet
which
little
personage
was
not
in
the
least
wanted
by
anybody
and
would
be
shoved
and
banged
out
of
everybody
way
until
it
should
grow
big
enough
to
shove
and
bang
show
her
a
funeral
and
she
saw
an
unremunerative
ceremony
in
the
nature
of
a
black
masquerade
conferring
a
temporary
gentility
on
the
performers
at
an
immense
expense
and
representing
the
only
formal
party
ever
given
by
the
deceased
show
her
a
live
father
and
she
saw
but
a
duplicate
of
her
own
father
who
from
her
infancy
had
been
taken
with
fits
and
starts
of
discharging
his
duty
to
her
which
duty
was
always
incorporated
in
the
form
of
a
fist
or
a
leathern
strap
and
being
discharged
hurt
her
all
things
considered
therefore
pleasant
riderhood
was
not
so
very
very
bad
there
was
even
a
touch
of
romance
in
her
of
such
romance
as
could
creep
into
limehouse
hole
and
maybe
sometimes
of
a
summer
evening
when
she
stood
with
folded
arms
at
her
looking
from
the
reeking
street
to
the
sky
where
the
sun
was
setting
she
may
have
had
some
vaporous
visions
of
islands
in
the
southern
seas
or
elsewhere
not
being
geographically
particular
where
it
would
be
good
to
roam
with
a
congenial
partner
among
groves
of
waiting
for
ships
to
be
wafted
from
the
hollow
ports
of
civilization
for
sailors
to
be
got
the
better
of
were
essential
to
miss
pleasant
eden
not
on
a
summer
evening
did
she
come
to
her
little
when
a
certain
man
standing
over
against
the
house
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
took
notice
of
her
that
was
on
a
cold
shrewd
windy
evening
after
dark
pleasant
riderhood
shared
with
most
of
the
lady
inhabitants
of
the
hole
the
peculiarity
that
her
hair
was
a
ragged
knot
constantly
coming
down
behind
and
that
she
never
could
enter
upon
any
undertaking
without
first
twisting
it
into
place
at
that
particular
moment
being
newly
come
to
the
threshold
to
take
a
look
out
of
doors
she
was
winding
herself
up
with
both
hands
after
this
fashion
and
so
prevalent
was
the
fashion
that
on
the
occasion
of
a
fight
or
other
disturbance
in
the
hole
the
ladies
would
be
seen
flocking
from
all
quarters
universally
twisting
their
as
they
came
along
and
many
of
them
in
the
hurry
of
the
moment
carrying
their
in
their
mouths
it
was
a
wretched
little
shop
with
a
roof
that
any
man
standing
in
it
could
touch
with
his
hand
little
better
than
a
cellar
or
cave
down
three
steps
yet
in
its
window
among
a
flaring
handkerchief
or
two
an
old
peacoat
or
so
a
few
valueless
watches
and
compasses
a
jar
of
tobacco
and
two
crossed
pipes
a
bottle
of
walnut
ketchup
and
some
horrible
sweets
these
creature
discomforts
serving
as
a
blind
to
the
main
business
of
the
leaving
shop
was
displayed
the
inscription
seaman
taking
notice
of
pleasant
riderhood
at
the
door
the
man
crossed
so
quickly
that
she
was
still
winding
herself
up
when
he
stood
close
before
her
your
father
at
home
said
he
think
he
is
returned
pleasant
dropping
her
arms
in
it
was
a
tentative
reply
the
man
having
a
seafaring
appearance
her
father
was
not
at
home
and
pleasant
knew
it
a
seat
by
the
fire
were
her
hospitable
words
when
she
had
got
him
in
of
your
calling
are
always
welcome
here
said
the
man
his
manner
was
the
manner
of
a
sailor
and
his
hands
were
the
hands
of
a
sailor
except
that
they
were
smooth
pleasant
had
an
eye
for
sailors
and
she
noticed
the
unused
colour
and
texture
of
the
hands
sunburnt
though
they
were
as
sharply
as
she
noticed
their
unmistakable
looseness
and
suppleness
as
he
sat
himself
down
with
his
left
arm
carelessly
thrown
across
his
left
leg
a
little
above
the
knee
and
the
right
arm
as
carelessly
thrown
over
the
elbow
of
the
wooden
chair
with
the
hand
curved
half
open
and
half
shut
as
if
it
had
just
let
go
a
rope
you
be
looking
for
a
pleasant
inquired
taking
her
observant
stand
on
one
side
of
the
fire
do
rightly
know
my
plans
yet
returned
the
man
ai
looking
for
a
leaving
shop
said
the
man
assented
pleasant
got
too
much
of
an
outfit
on
you
for
that
but
if
you
should
want
either
this
is
both
ay
said
the
man
glancing
round
the
place
know
i
been
here
before
you
leave
anything
when
you
were
here
before
asked
pleasant
with
a
view
to
principal
and
interest
the
man
shook
his
head
am
pretty
sure
you
never
boarded
here
the
man
again
shook
his
head
did
you
do
here
when
you
were
here
before
asked
pleasant
i
do
remember
you
not
at
all
likely
you
should
i
only
stood
at
the
door
one
night
on
the
lower
step
there
while
a
shipmate
of
mine
looked
in
to
speak
to
your
father
i
remember
the
place
well
looking
very
curiously
round
it
that
have
been
long
ago
a
goodish
bit
ago
when
i
came
off
my
last
voyage
you
have
not
been
to
sea
lately
been
in
the
sick
bay
since
then
and
been
employed
ashore
to
be
sure
that
accounts
for
your
hands
the
man
with
a
keen
look
a
quick
smile
and
a
change
of
manner
caught
her
up
a
good
observer
yes
that
accounts
for
my
hands
pleasant
was
somewhat
disquieted
by
his
look
and
returned
it
suspiciously
not
only
was
his
change
of
manner
though
very
sudden
quite
collected
but
his
former
manner
which
he
resumed
had
a
certain
suppressed
confidence
and
sense
of
power
in
it
that
were
half
threatening
your
father
be
long
he
inquired
do
know
i
ca
say
you
supposed
he
was
at
home
it
would
seem
that
he
has
just
gone
out
how
that
supposed
he
had
come
home
pleasant
explained
you
supposed
he
had
come
home
then
he
has
been
some
time
out
how
that
do
want
to
deceive
you
father
on
the
river
in
his
boat
the
old
work
asked
the
man
do
know
what
you
mean
said
pleasant
shrinking
a
step
back
on
earth
d
want
do
want
to
hurt
your
father
i
do
want
to
say
i
might
if
i
chose
i
want
to
speak
to
him
not
much
in
that
is
there
there
shall
be
no
secrets
from
you
you
shall
be
by
and
plainly
miss
riderhood
there
nothing
to
be
got
out
of
me
or
made
of
me
i
am
not
good
for
the
leaving
shop
i
am
not
good
for
the
i
am
not
good
for
anything
in
your
way
to
the
extent
of
of
halfpence
put
the
idea
aside
and
we
shall
get
on
together
you
a
seafaring
man
argued
pleasant
as
if
that
were
a
sufficient
reason
for
his
being
good
for
something
in
her
way
and
no
i
have
been
and
i
may
be
again
but
i
am
not
for
you
wo
you
take
my
word
for
it
the
conversation
had
arrived
at
a
crisis
to
justify
miss
pleasant
hair
in
tumbling
down
it
tumbled
down
accordingly
and
she
twisted
it
up
looking
from
under
her
bent
forehead
at
the
man
in
taking
stock
of
his
familiarly
worn
nautical
clothes
piece
by
piece
she
took
stock
of
a
formidable
knife
in
a
sheath
at
his
waist
ready
to
his
hand
and
of
a
whistle
hanging
round
his
neck
and
of
a
short
jagged
knotted
club
with
a
loaded
head
that
peeped
out
of
a
pocket
of
his
loose
outer
jacket
or
frock
he
sat
quietly
looking
at
her
but
with
these
appendages
partially
revealing
themselves
and
with
a
quantity
of
bristling
head
and
whisker
he
had
a
formidable
appearance
you
take
my
word
for
it
he
asked
again
pleasant
answered
with
a
short
dumb
nod
he
rejoined
with
another
short
dumb
nod
then
he
got
up
and
stood
with
his
arms
folded
in
front
of
the
fire
looking
down
into
it
occasionally
as
she
stood
with
her
arms
folded
leaning
against
the
side
of
the
wile
away
the
time
till
your
father
comes
he
said
is
there
much
robbing
and
murdering
of
seamen
about
the
now
said
pleasant
of
that
sort
are
sometimes
made
about
ratcliffe
and
wapping
and
up
that
way
but
who
knows
how
many
are
true
be
sure
and
it
do
seem
necessary
what
i
say
observed
pleasant
the
reason
for
it
bless
the
sailors
it
ai
as
if
they
ever
could
keep
what
they
have
without
it
right
their
money
may
be
soon
got
out
of
them
without
violence
said
the
man
course
it
may
said
pleasant
then
they
ship
again
and
get
more
and
the
best
thing
for
too
to
ship
again
as
soon
as
ever
they
can
be
brought
to
it
they
never
so
well
off
as
when
afloat
tell
you
why
i
ask
pursued
the
visitor
looking
up
from
the
fire
was
once
beset
that
way
myself
and
left
for
dead
said
pleasant
did
it
happen
happened
returned
the
man
with
a
ruminative
air
as
he
drew
his
right
hand
across
his
chin
and
dipped
the
other
in
the
pocket
of
his
rough
outer
coat
happened
somewhere
about
here
as
i
reckon
i
think
it
can
have
been
a
mile
from
here
you
drunk
asked
pleasant
was
muddled
but
not
with
fair
drinking
i
had
not
been
drinking
you
understand
a
mouthful
did
it
pleasant
with
a
grave
look
shook
her
head
importing
that
she
understood
the
process
but
decidedly
disapproved
trade
is
one
thing
said
she
that
another
no
one
has
a
right
to
carry
on
with
jack
in
that
way
sentiment
does
you
credit
returned
the
man
with
a
grim
smile
and
added
in
a
mutter
more
so
as
i
believe
it
not
your
yes
i
had
a
bad
time
of
it
that
time
i
lost
everything
and
had
a
sharp
struggle
for
my
life
weak
as
i
was
you
get
the
parties
punished
asked
pleasant
tremendous
punishment
followed
said
the
man
more
seriously
it
was
not
of
my
bringing
about
whose
then
asked
pleasant
the
man
pointed
upward
with
his
forefinger
and
slowly
recovering
that
hand
settled
his
chin
in
it
again
as
he
looked
at
the
fire
bringing
her
inherited
eye
to
bear
upon
him
pleasant
riderhood
felt
more
and
more
uncomfortable
his
manner
was
so
mysterious
so
stern
so
said
the
damsel
am
glad
punishment
followed
and
i
say
so
fair
trade
with
seafaring
men
gets
a
bad
name
through
deeds
of
violence
i
am
as
much
against
deeds
of
violence
being
done
to
seafaring
men
as
seafaring
men
can
be
themselves
i
am
of
the
same
opinion
as
my
mother
was
when
she
was
living
fair
trade
my
mother
used
to
say
but
no
robbery
and
no
blows
in
the
way
of
trade
miss
pleasant
would
have
taken
and
indeed
did
take
when
she
could
as
much
as
thirty
shillings
a
week
for
board
that
would
be
dear
at
five
and
likewise
conducted
the
leaving
business
upon
correspondingly
equitable
principles
yet
she
had
that
tenderness
of
conscience
and
those
feelings
of
humanity
that
the
moment
her
ideas
of
trade
were
overstepped
she
became
the
champion
even
against
her
father
whom
she
seldom
otherwise
resisted
but
she
was
here
interrupted
by
her
father
voice
exclaiming
angrily
poll
parrot
and
by
her
father
hat
being
heavily
flung
from
his
hand
and
striking
her
face
accustomed
to
such
occasional
manifestations
of
his
sense
of
parental
duty
pleasant
merely
wiped
her
face
on
her
hair
which
of
course
had
tumbled
down
before
she
twisted
it
up
this
was
another
common
procedure
on
the
part
of
the
ladies
of
the
hole
when
heated
by
verbal
or
fistic
altercation
if
i
believe
such
a
poll
parrot
as
you
was
ever
learned
to
speak
growled
mr
riderhood
stooping
to
pick
up
his
hat
and
making
a
feint
at
her
with
his
head
and
right
elbow
for
he
took
the
delicate
subject
of
robbing
seamen
in
extraordinary
dudgeon
and
was
out
of
humour
too
are
you
poll
parroting
at
now
ai
you
got
nothing
to
do
but
fold
your
arms
and
stand
a
poll
parroting
all
night
her
alone
urged
the
man
was
only
speaking
to
me
her
alone
too
retorted
mr
riderhood
eyeing
him
all
over
you
know
she
my
daughter
do
you
know
that
i
wo
have
no
poll
parroting
on
the
part
of
my
daughter
no
nor
yet
that
i
wo
take
no
poll
parroting
from
no
man
and
who
may
you
be
and
what
may
you
want
can
i
tell
you
until
you
are
silent
returned
the
other
fiercely
said
mr
riderhood
quailing
a
little
am
willing
to
be
silent
for
the
purpose
of
hearing
but
do
poll
parrot
me
you
thirsty
you
the
man
asked
in
the
same
fierce
short
way
after
returning
his
look
said
mr
riderhood
i
always
thirsty
indignant
at
the
absurdity
of
the
question
will
you
drink
demanded
the
man
wine
returned
mr
riderhood
in
the
same
sharp
tone
capable
of
it
the
man
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
took
out
half
a
sovereign
and
begged
the
favour
of
miss
pleasant
that
she
would
fetch
a
bottle
the
cork
undrawn
he
added
emphatically
looking
at
her
father
take
my
alfred
david
muttered
mr
riderhood
slowly
relaxing
into
a
dark
smile
you
know
a
move
do
i
know
you
n
n
no
i
know
you
the
man
replied
you
do
know
me
and
so
they
stood
looking
at
one
another
surlily
enough
until
pleasant
came
back
small
glasses
on
the
shelf
said
riderhood
to
his
daughter
me
the
one
without
a
foot
i
gets
my
living
by
the
sweat
of
my
brow
and
it
good
enough
for
me
this
had
a
modest
appearance
but
it
soon
turned
out
that
as
by
reason
of
the
impossibility
of
standing
the
glass
upright
while
there
was
anything
in
it
it
required
to
be
emptied
as
soon
as
filled
mr
riderhood
managed
to
drink
in
the
proportion
of
three
to
one
with
his
fortunatus
goblet
ready
in
his
hand
mr
riderhood
sat
down
on
one
side
of
the
table
before
the
fire
and
the
strange
man
on
the
other
pleasant
occupying
a
stool
between
the
latter
and
the
fireside
the
background
composed
of
handkerchiefs
coats
shirts
hats
and
other
old
articles
leaving
had
a
general
dim
resemblance
to
human
listeners
especially
where
a
shiny
black
suit
and
hat
hung
looking
very
like
a
clumsy
mariner
with
his
back
to
the
company
who
was
so
curious
to
overhear
that
he
paused
for
the
purpose
with
his
coat
half
pulled
on
and
his
shoulders
up
to
his
ears
in
the
uncompleted
action
the
visitor
first
held
the
bottle
against
the
light
of
the
candle
and
next
examined
the
top
of
the
cork
satisfied
that
it
had
not
been
tampered
with
he
slowly
took
from
his
breastpocket
a
rusty
and
with
a
corkscrew
in
the
handle
opened
the
wine
that
done
he
looked
at
the
cork
unscrewed
it
from
the
corkscrew
laid
each
separately
on
the
table
and
with
the
end
of
the
sailor
knot
of
his
neckerchief
dusted
the
inside
of
the
neck
of
the
bottle
all
this
with
great
deliberation
at
first
riderhood
had
sat
with
his
footless
glass
extended
at
length
for
filling
while
the
very
deliberate
stranger
seemed
absorbed
in
his
preparations
but
gradually
his
arm
reverted
home
to
him
and
his
glass
was
lowered
and
lowered
until
he
rested
it
upside
down
upon
the
table
by
the
same
degrees
his
attention
became
concentrated
on
the
knife
and
now
as
the
man
held
out
the
bottle
to
fill
all
round
riderhood
stood
up
leaned
over
the
table
to
look
closer
at
the
knife
and
stared
from
it
to
him
the
matter
asked
the
man
i
know
that
knife
said
riderhood
i
dare
say
you
do
he
motioned
to
him
to
hold
up
his
glass
and
filled
it
riderhood
emptied
it
to
the
last
drop
and
began
again
there
knife
said
the
man
composedly
was
going
to
drink
to
your
daughter
your
health
miss
riderhood
knife
was
the
knife
of
a
seaman
named
george
radfoot
was
seaman
was
well
beknown
to
me
was
come
to
him
has
come
to
him
death
came
to
him
in
an
ugly
shape
he
looked
said
the
man
horrible
after
it
what
said
riderhood
with
a
frowning
stare
he
was
killed
who
killed
him
only
answering
with
a
shrug
the
man
filled
the
footless
glass
and
riderhood
emptied
it
looking
amazedly
from
his
daughter
to
his
visitor
do
mean
to
tell
a
honest
man
he
was
recommencing
with
his
empty
glass
in
his
hand
when
his
eye
became
fascinated
by
the
stranger
outer
coat
he
leaned
across
the
table
to
see
it
nearer
touched
the
sleeve
turned
the
cuff
to
look
at
the
the
man
in
his
perfect
composure
offering
not
the
least
objection
and
exclaimed
my
belief
as
this
here
coat
was
george
radfoot
too
are
right
he
wore
it
the
last
time
you
ever
saw
him
and
the
last
time
you
ever
will
see
him
in
this
world
my
belief
you
mean
to
tell
me
to
my
face
you
killed
him
exclaimed
riderhood
but
nevertheless
allowing
his
glass
to
be
filled
again
the
man
only
answered
with
another
shrug
and
showed
no
symptom
of
confusion
i
may
die
if
i
know
what
to
be
up
to
with
this
chap
said
riderhood
after
staring
at
him
and
tossing
his
last
glassful
down
his
throat
know
what
to
make
of
you
say
something
plain
will
returned
the
other
leaning
forward
across
the
table
and
speaking
in
a
low
impressive
voice
a
liar
you
are
the
honest
witness
rose
and
made
as
though
he
would
fling
his
glass
in
the
man
face
the
man
not
wincing
and
merely
shaking
his
forefinger
half
knowingly
half
menacingly
the
piece
of
honesty
thought
better
of
it
and
sat
down
again
putting
the
glass
down
too
when
you
went
to
that
lawyer
yonder
in
the
temple
with
that
invented
story
said
the
stranger
in
an
exasperatingly
comfortable
sort
of
confidence
might
have
had
your
strong
suspicions
of
a
friend
of
your
own
you
know
i
think
you
had
you
know
my
suspicions
of
what
friend
me
again
whose
knife
was
this
demanded
the
man
was
possessed
by
and
was
the
property
of
him
as
i
have
made
mention
on
said
riderhood
stupidly
evading
the
actual
mention
of
the
name
me
again
whose
coat
was
this
there
article
of
clothing
likeways
belonged
to
and
was
wore
by
him
as
i
have
made
mention
on
was
again
the
dull
old
bailey
evasion
suspect
that
you
gave
him
the
credit
of
the
deed
and
of
keeping
cleverly
out
of
the
way
but
there
was
small
cleverness
in
his
keeping
out
of
the
way
the
cleverness
would
have
been
to
have
got
back
for
one
single
instant
to
the
light
of
the
sun
is
come
to
a
pretty
pass
growled
mr
riderhood
rising
to
his
feet
goaded
to
stand
at
bay
bullyers
as
is
wearing
dead
clothes
and
bullyers
as
is
armed
with
dead
men
knives
is
to
come
into
the
houses
of
honest
live
men
getting
their
livings
by
the
sweats
of
their
brows
and
is
to
make
these
here
sort
of
charges
with
no
rhyme
and
no
reason
neither
the
one
nor
yet
the
other
why
should
i
have
had
my
suspicions
of
him
you
knew
him
replied
the
man
you
had
been
one
with
him
and
knew
his
real
character
under
a
fair
outside
because
on
the
night
which
you
had
afterwards
reason
to
believe
to
be
the
very
night
of
the
murder
he
came
in
here
within
an
hour
of
his
having
left
his
ship
in
the
docks
and
asked
you
in
what
lodgings
he
could
find
room
was
there
no
stranger
with
him
take
my
everlasting
alfred
david
that
you
with
him
answered
riderhood
talk
big
you
do
but
things
look
pretty
black
against
yourself
to
my
thinking
you
charge
again
me
that
george
radfoot
got
lost
sight
of
and
was
no
more
thought
of
that
for
a
sailor
why
there
fifty
such
out
of
sight
and
out
of
mind
ten
times
as
long
as
him
through
entering
in
different
names
when
the
voyage
is
made
and
what
not
a
turning
up
to
light
every
day
about
here
and
no
matter
made
of
it
ask
my
daughter
you
could
go
on
poll
parroting
enough
with
her
when
i
come
in
poll
parrot
a
little
with
her
on
this
pint
you
and
your
suspicions
of
my
suspicions
of
him
what
are
my
suspicions
of
you
you
tell
me
george
radfoot
got
killed
i
ask
you
who
done
it
and
how
you
know
it
you
carry
his
knife
and
you
wear
his
coat
i
ask
you
how
you
come
by
hand
over
that
there
bottle
here
mr
riderhood
appeared
to
labour
under
a
virtuous
delusion
that
it
was
his
own
property
you
he
added
turning
to
his
daughter
as
he
filled
the
footless
glass
it
war
wasting
good
sherry
wine
on
you
i
chuck
this
at
you
for
poll
parroting
with
this
man
it
along
of
poll
parroting
that
such
like
as
him
gets
their
suspicions
whereas
i
gets
mine
by
argueyment
and
being
a
honest
man
and
sweating
away
at
the
brow
as
a
honest
man
ought
here
he
filled
the
footless
goblet
again
and
stood
chewing
one
half
of
its
contents
and
looking
down
into
the
other
as
he
slowly
rolled
the
wine
about
in
the
glass
while
pleasant
whose
sympathetic
hair
had
come
down
on
her
being
apostrophised
rearranged
it
much
in
the
style
of
the
tail
of
a
horse
when
proceeding
to
market
to
be
sold
have
you
finished
asked
the
strange
man
said
riderhood

said
riderhood
with
a
threatening
action
alone
know
returned
the
man
sternly
shaking
his
head
mysteries
of
that
crime
i
alone
know
that
your
story
can
not
possibly
be
true
i
alone
know
that
it
must
be
altogether
false
and
that
you
must
know
it
to
be
altogether
false
i
come
here
to
tell
you
so
much
of
what
i
know
and
no
more
mr
riderhood
with
his
crooked
eye
upon
his
visitor
meditated
for
some
moments
and
then
refilled
his
glass
and
tipped
the
contents
down
his
throat
in
three
tips
the
he
then
said
to
his
daughter
putting
the
glass
suddenly
down
turn
the
key
and
stand
by
it
if
you
know
all
this
you

as
he
spoke
between
the
visitor
and
the
door
ha
you
gone
to
lawyer

to
myself
was
the
cool
answer
you
know
that
if
you

the
deed

you
say

could
tell
is
worth
from
five
to
ten
thousand
pound
asked
riderhood
know
it
very
well
and
when
i
claim
the
money
you
shall
share
it
the
honest
man
paused
and
drew
a
little
nearer
to
the
visitor
and
a
little
further
from
the
door
know
it
repeated
the
man
quietly
well
as
i
know
that
you
and
george
radfoot
were
one
together
in
more
than
one
dark
business
and
as
well
as
i
know
that
you
roger
riderhood
conspired
against
an
innocent
man
for
and
as
well
as
i
know
that
i
can
and
that
i
swear
i
will
give
you
up
on
both
scores
and
be
the
proof
against
you
in
my
own
person

more
trouble
father

off
a
poll
parroting
i
ask
you
cried
mr
riderhood
half
beside
himself
between
the
two
then
propitiatingly
and
crawlingly
sir
you
ha
said
what
you
want
of
me
is
it
fair
is
it
worthy
of
yourself
to
talk
of
my
defying
you
afore

say
what
you
want
of
me
do
want
much
said
the
man

made
and
half
unmade
what

done
for
the
must
be
thoroughly
undone
but
shipmate

me
shipmate
said
the
man
then
urged
mr
riderhood
you
wo
object
to
captain
it
a
honourable
title
and
you
fully
look
it
captain
the
man
dead
now
i
ask
you
fair
ai
gaffer
dead
returned
the
other
with
impatience
he
is
dead
what
then
words
hurt
a
dead
man
captain
i
only
ask
you
fair
can
hurt
the
memory
of
a
dead
man
and
they
can
hurt
his
living
children
how
many
children
had
this
man
gaffer
captain
whom
else
are
we
speaking
returned
the
other
with
a
movement
of
his
foot
as
if
rogue
riderhood
were
beginning
to
sneak
before
him
in
the
body
as
well
as
the
spirit
and
he
spurned
him
off
have
heard
of
a
daughter
and
a
son
i
ask
for
information
i
ask
your
daughter
i
prefer
to
speak
to
her
what
children
did
hexam
leave
pleasant
looking
to
her
father
for
permission
to
reply
that
honest
man
exclaimed
with
great
bitterness
the
devil
do
you
answer
the
captain
you
can
poll
parrot
enough
when
you
ai
wanted
to
poll
parrot
you
perwerse
jade
thus
encouraged
pleasant
explained
that
there
were
only
lizzie
the
daughter
in
question
and
the
youth
both
very
respectable
she
added
is
dreadful
that
any
stigma
should
attach
to
them
said
the
visitor
whom
the
consideration
rendered
so
uneasy
that
he
rose
and
paced
to
and
fro
muttering
unforeseen
how
could
it
be
foreseen
then
he
stopped
and
asked
aloud
do
they
live
pleasant
further
explained
that
only
the
daughter
had
resided
with
the
father
at
the
time
of
his
accidental
death
and
that
she
had
immediately
afterwards
quitted
the
neighbourhood
know
that
said
the
man
i
have
been
to
the
place
they
dwelt
in
at
the
time
of
the
inquest
could
you
quietly
find
out
for
me
where
she
lives
now
pleasant
had
no
doubt
she
could
do
that
within
what
time
did
she
think
within
a
day
the
visitor
said
that
was
well
and
he
would
return
for
the
information
relying
on
its
being
obtained
to
this
dialogue
riderhood
had
attended
in
silence
and
he
now
obsequiously
bespake
the
captain
mentioning
them
words
of
mine
respecting
gaffer
it
is
contrairily
to
be
bore
in
mind
that
gaffer
always
were
a
precious
rascal
and
that
his
line
were
a
thieving
line
likeways
when
i
went
to
them
two
governors
lawyer
lightwood
and
the
governor
with
my
information
i
may
have
been
a
little
for
the
cause
of
justice
or
to
put
it
another
way
a
little
by
them
feelings
which
rouses
a
man
up
when
a
pot
of
money
is
going
about
to
get
his
hand
into
that
pot
of
money
for
his
family
sake
besides
which
i
think
the
wine
of
them
two
governors
was
i
will
not
say
a
hocussed
wine
but
fur
from
a
wine
as
was
elthy
for
the
mind
and
there
another
thing
to
be
remembered
captain
did
i
stick
to
them
words
when
gaffer
was
no
more
and
did
i
say
bold
to
them
two
governors
governors
both
wot
i
informed
i
still
inform
wot
was
took
down
i
hold
to
no
i
says
frank
and
open
no
shuffling
mind
you
captain
i
may
have
been
mistook
i
been
a
thinking
of
it
it
may
have
been
took
down
correct
on
this
and
that
and
i
wo
swear
to
thick
and
thin
i
rayther
forfeit
your
good
opinions
than
do
and
so
far
as
i
know
concluded
mr
riderhood
by
way
of
proof
and
evidence
to
character
have
actiwally
forfeited
the
good
opinions
of
several
persons
even
your
own
captain
if
i
understand
your
words
but
sooner
do
it
than
be
forswore
there
if
that
conspiracy
call
me
conspirator
shall
sign
said
the
visitor
taking
very
little
heed
of
this
oration
statement
that
it
was
all
utterly
false
and
the
poor
girl
shall
have
it
i
will
bring
it
with
me
for
your
signature
when
i
come
again
might
you
be
expected
captain
inquired
riderhood
again
dubiously
getting
between
him
and
door
soon
enough
for
you
i
shall
not
disappoint
you
do
be
afraid
you
be
inclined
to
leave
any
name
captain
not
at
all
i
have
no
such
intention
shall
is
of
a
hard
word
captain
urged
riderhood
still
feebly
dodging
between
him
and
the
door
as
he
advanced
you
say
a
man
shall
sign
this
and
that
and
captain
you
order
him
about
in
a
grand
sort
of
a
way
do
it
seem
so
to
yourself
the
man
stood
still
and
angrily
fixed
him
with
his
eyes
father
entreated
pleasant
from
the
door
with
her
disengaged
hand
nervously
trembling
at
her
lips
do
get
into
trouble
any
more
me
out
captain
hear
me
out
all
i
was
wishing
to
mention
captain
afore
you
took
your
departer
said
the
sneaking
mr
riderhood
falling
out
of
his
path
your
handsome
words
relating
to
the
reward
i
claim
it
said
the
man
in
a
tone
which
seemed
to
leave
some
such
words
as
dog
very
distinctly
understood
shall
share
it
looking
stedfastly
at
riderhood
he
once
more
said
in
a
low
voice
this
time
with
a
grim
sort
of
admiration
of
him
as
a
perfect
piece
of
evil
a
liar
you
are
and
nodding
his
head
twice
or
thrice
over
the
compliment
passed
out
of
the
shop
but
to
pleasant
he
said
kindly
the
honest
man
who
gained
his
living
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
remained
in
a
state
akin
to
stupefaction
until
the
footless
glass
and
the
unfinished
bottle
conveyed
themselves
into
his
mind
from
his
mind
he
conveyed
them
into
his
hands
and
so
conveyed
the
last
of
the
wine
into
his
stomach
when
that
was
done
he
awoke
to
a
clear
perception
that
poll
parroting
was
solely
chargeable
with
what
had
passed
therefore
not
to
be
remiss
in
his
duty
as
a
father
he
threw
a
pair
of
at
pleasant
which
she
ducked
to
avoid
and
then
cried
poor
thing
using
her
hair
for
a
chapter
a
solo
and
a
duett
the
wind
was
blowing
so
hard
when
the
visitor
came
out
at
the
into
the
darkness
and
dirt
of
limehouse
hole
that
it
almost
blew
him
in
again
doors
were
slamming
violently
lamps
were
flickering
or
blown
out
signs
were
rocking
in
their
frames
the
water
of
the
kennels
flew
about
in
drops
like
rain
indifferent
to
the
weather
and
even
preferring
it
to
better
weather
for
its
clearance
of
the
streets
the
man
looked
about
him
with
a
scrutinizing
glance
much
i
know
he
murmured
have
never
been
here
since
that
night
and
never
was
here
before
that
night
but
thus
much
i
recognize
i
wonder
which
way
did
we
take
when
we
came
out
of
that
shop
we
turned
to
the
right
as
i
have
turned
but
i
can
recall
no
more
did
we
go
by
this
alley
or
down
that
little
lane
he
tried
both
but
both
confused
him
equally
and
he
came
straying
back
to
the
same
spot
remember
there
were
poles
pushed
out
of
upper
windows
on
which
clothes
were
drying
and
i
remember
a
low
and
the
sound
flowing
down
a
narrow
passage
belonging
to
it
of
the
scraping
of
a
fiddle
and
the
shuffling
of
feet
but
here
are
all
these
things
in
the
lane
and
here
are
all
these
things
in
the
alley
and
i
have
nothing
else
in
my
mind
but
a
wall
a
dark
doorway
a
flight
of
stairs
and
a
room
he
tried
a
new
direction
but
made
nothing
of
it
walls
dark
doorways
flights
of
stairs
and
rooms
were
too
abundant
and
like
most
people
so
puzzled
he
again
and
again
described
a
circle
and
found
himself
at
the
point
from
which
he
had
begun
is
like
what
i
have
read
in
narratives
of
escape
from
prison
said
he
the
little
track
of
the
fugitives
in
the
night
always
seems
to
take
the
shape
of
the
great
round
world
on
which
they
wander
as
if
it
were
a
secret
law
here
he
ceased
to
be
the
man
on
whom
miss
pleasant
riderhood
had
looked
and
allowing
for
his
being
still
wrapped
in
a
nautical
overcoat
became
as
like
that
same
lost
wanted
mr
julius
handford
as
never
man
was
like
another
in
this
world
in
the
breast
of
the
coat
he
stowed
the
bristling
hair
and
whisker
in
a
moment
as
the
favouring
wind
went
with
him
down
a
solitary
place
that
it
had
swept
clear
of
passengers
yet
in
that
same
moment
he
was
the
secretary
also
mr
boffin
secretary
for
john
rokesmith
too
was
as
like
that
same
lost
wanted
mr
julius
handford
as
never
man
was
like
another
in
this
world
have
no
clue
to
the
scene
of
my
death
said
he
that
it
matters
now
but
having
risked
discovery
by
venturing
here
at
all
i
should
have
been
glad
to
track
some
part
of
the
way
with
which
singular
words
he
abandoned
his
search
came
up
out
of
limehouse
hole
and
took
the
way
past
limehouse
church
at
the
great
iron
gate
of
the
churchyard
he
stopped
and
looked
in
he
looked
up
at
the
high
tower
spectrally
resisting
the
wind
and
he
looked
round
at
the
white
tombstones
like
enough
to
the
dead
in
their
and
he
counted
the
nine
tolls
of
the
is
a
sensation
not
experienced
by
many
mortals
said
he
be
looking
into
a
churchyard
on
a
wild
windy
night
and
to
feel
that
i
no
more
hold
a
place
among
the
living
than
these
dead
do
and
even
to
know
that
i
lie
buried
somewhere
else
as
they
lie
buried
here
nothing
uses
me
to
it
a
spirit
that
was
once
a
man
could
hardly
feel
stranger
or
lonelier
going
unrecognized
among
mankind
than
i
feel
this
is
the
fanciful
side
of
the
situation
it
has
a
real
side
so
difficult
that
though
i
think
of
it
every
day
i
never
thoroughly
think
it
out
now
let
me
determine
to
think
it
out
as
i
walk
home
i
know
i
evade
it
as
many
men
perhaps
most
men
do
evade
thinking
their
way
through
their
greatest
perplexity
i
will
try
to
pin
myself
to
mine
do
evade
it
john
harmon
do
evade
it
think
it
out
i
came
to
england
attracted
to
the
country
with
which
i
had
none
but
most
miserable
associations
by
the
accounts
of
my
fine
inheritance
that
found
me
abroad
i
came
back
shrinking
from
my
father
money
shrinking
from
my
father
memory
mistrustful
of
being
forced
on
a
mercenary
wife
mistrustful
of
my
father
intention
in
thrusting
that
marriage
on
me
mistrustful
that
i
was
already
growing
avaricious
mistrustful
that
i
was
slackening
in
gratitude
to
the
two
dear
noble
honest
friends
who
had
made
the
only
sunlight
in
my
childish
life
or
that
of
my
heartbroken
sister
i
came
back
timid
divided
in
my
mind
afraid
of
myself
and
everybody
here
knowing
of
nothing
but
wretchedness
that
my
father
wealth
had
ever
brought
about
now
stop
and
so
far
think
it
out
john
harmon
is
that
so
that
is
exactly
so
board
serving
as
third
mate
was
george
radfoot
i
knew
nothing
of
him
his
name
first
became
known
to
me
about
a
week
before
we
sailed
through
my
being
accosted
by
one
of
the
clerks
as
mr
it
was
one
day
when
i
had
gone
aboard
to
look
to
my
preparations
and
the
clerk
coming
behind
me
as
i
stood
on
deck
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
and
said
mr
look
here
referring
to
some
papers
that
he
had
in
his
hand
and
my
name
first
became
known
to
radfoot
through
another
clerk
within
a
day
or
two
and
while
the
ship
was
yet
in
port
coming
up
behind
him
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
and
beginning
i
beg
your
pardon
mr
harmon
i
believe
we
were
alike
in
bulk
and
stature
but
not
otherwise
and
that
we
were
not
strikingly
alike
even
in
those
respects
when
we
were
together
and
could
be
compared
a
sociable
word
or
two
on
these
mistakes
became
an
easy
introduction
between
us
and
the
weather
was
hot
and
he
helped
me
to
a
cool
cabin
on
deck
alongside
his
own
and
his
first
school
had
been
at
brussels
as
mine
had
been
and
he
had
learnt
french
as
i
had
learnt
it
and
he
had
a
little
history
of
himself
to
relate
god
only
knows
how
much
of
it
true
and
how
much
of
it
false
that
had
its
likeness
to
mine
i
had
been
a
seaman
too
so
we
got
to
be
confidential
together
and
the
more
easily
yet
because
he
and
every
one
on
board
had
known
by
general
rumour
what
i
was
making
the
voyage
to
england
for
by
such
degrees
and
means
he
came
to
the
knowledge
of
my
uneasiness
of
mind
and
of
its
setting
at
that
time
in
the
direction
of
desiring
to
see
and
form
some
judgment
of
my
allotted
wife
before
she
could
possibly
know
me
for
myself
also
to
try
mrs
boffin
and
give
her
a
glad
surprise
so
the
plot
was
made
out
of
our
getting
common
sailors
dresses
as
he
was
able
to
guide
me
about
london
and
throwing
ourselves
in
bella
neighbourhood
and
trying
to
put
ourselves
in
her
way
and
doing
whatever
chance
might
favour
on
the
spot
and
seeing
what
came
of
it
if
nothing
came
of
it
i
should
be
no
worse
off
and
there
would
merely
be
a
short
delay
in
my
presenting
myself
to
lightwood
i
have
all
these
facts
right
yes
they
are
all
accurately
right
advantage
in
all
this
was
that
for
a
time
i
was
to
be
lost
it
might
be
for
a
day
or
for
two
days
but
i
must
be
lost
sight
of
on
landing
or
there
would
be
recognition
anticipation
and
failure
therefore
i
disembarked
with
my
valise
in
my
hand
as
potterson
the
steward
and
mr
jacob
kibble
my
afterwards
remembered
and
waited
for
him
in
the
dark
by
that
very
limehouse
church
which
is
now
behind
me
i
had
always
shunned
the
port
of
london
i
only
knew
the
church
through
his
pointing
out
its
spire
from
on
board
perhaps
i
might
recall
if
it
were
any
good
to
try
the
way
by
which
i
went
to
it
alone
from
the
river
but
how
we
two
went
from
it
to
riderhood
shop
i
know
any
more
than
i
know
what
turns
we
took
and
doubles
we
made
after
we
left
it
the
way
was
purposely
confused
no
doubt
let
me
go
on
thinking
the
facts
out
and
avoid
confusing
them
with
my
speculations
whether
he
took
me
by
a
straight
way
or
a
crooked
way
what
is
that
to
the
purpose
now
steady
john
harmon
we
stopped
at
riderhood
and
he
asked
that
scoundrel
a
question
or
two
purporting
to
refer
only
to
the
in
which
there
was
accommodation
for
us
had
i
the
least
suspicion
of
him
none
certainly
none
until
afterwards
when
i
held
the
clue
i
think
he
must
have
got
from
riderhood
in
a
paper
the
drug
or
whatever
it
was
that
afterwards
stupefied
me
but
i
am
far
from
sure
all
i
felt
safe
in
charging
on
him
was
old
companionship
in
villainy
between
them
their
undisguised
intimacy
and
the
character
i
now
know
riderhood
to
bear
made
that
not
at
all
adventurous
but
i
am
not
clear
about
the
drug
thinking
out
the
circumstances
on
which
i
found
my
suspicion
they
are
only
two
one
i
remember
his
changing
a
small
folded
paper
from
one
pocket
to
another
after
we
came
out
which
he
had
not
touched
before
two
i
now
know
riderhood
to
have
been
previously
taken
up
for
being
concerned
in
the
robbery
of
an
unlucky
seaman
to
whom
some
such
poison
had
been
given
is
my
conviction
that
we
can
not
have
gone
a
mile
from
that
shop
before
we
came
to
the
wall
the
dark
doorway
the
flight
of
stairs
and
the
room
the
night
was
particularly
dark
and
it
rained
hard
as
i
think
the
circumstances
back
i
hear
the
rain
splashing
on
the
stone
pavement
of
the
passage
which
was
not
under
cover
the
room
overlooked
the
river
or
a
dock
or
a
creek
and
the
tide
was
out
being
possessed
of
the
time
down
to
that
point
i
know
by
the
hour
that
it
must
have
been
about
low
water
but
while
the
coffee
was
getting
ready
i
drew
back
the
curtain
a
curtain
and
looking
out
knew
by
the
kind
of
reflection
below
of
the
few
neighbouring
lights
that
they
were
reflected
in
tidal
mud
had
carried
under
his
arm
a
canvas
bag
containing
a
suit
of
his
clothes
i
had
no
change
of
outer
clothes
with
me
as
i
was
to
buy
slops
you
are
very
wet
mr
harmon
i
can
hear
him
saying
and
i
am
quite
dry
under
this
good
waterproof
coat
put
on
these
clothes
of
mine
you
may
find
on
trying
them
that
they
will
answer
your
purpose
as
well
as
the
slops
you
mean
to
buy
or
better
while
you
change
i
hurry
the
hot
when
he
came
back
i
had
his
clothes
on
and
there
was
a
black
man
with
him
wearing
a
linen
jacket
like
a
steward
who
put
the
smoking
coffee
on
the
table
in
a
tray
and
never
looked
at
me
i
am
so
far
literal
and
exact
literal
and
exact
i
am
certain
i
pass
to
sick
and
deranged
impressions
they
are
so
strong
that
i
rely
upon
them
but
there
are
spaces
between
them
that
i
know
nothing
about
and
they
are
not
pervaded
by
any
idea
of
time
had
drank
some
coffee
when
to
my
sense
of
sight
he
began
to
swell
immensely
and
something
urged
me
to
rush
at
him
we
had
a
struggle
near
the
door
he
got
from
me
through
my
not
knowing
where
to
strike
in
the
whirling
round
of
the
room
and
the
flashing
of
flames
of
fire
between
us
i
dropped
down
lying
helpless
on
the
ground
i
was
turned
over
by
a
foot
i
was
dragged
by
the
neck
into
a
corner
i
heard
men
speak
together
i
was
turned
over
by
other
feet
i
saw
a
figure
like
myself
lying
dressed
in
my
clothes
on
a
bed
what
might
have
been
for
anything
i
knew
a
silence
of
days
weeks
months
years
was
broken
by
a
violent
wrestling
of
men
all
over
the
room
the
figure
like
myself
was
assailed
and
my
valise
was
in
its
hand
i
was
trodden
upon
and
fallen
over
i
heard
a
noise
of
blows
and
thought
it
was
a
cutting
down
a
tree
i
could
not
have
said
that
my
name
was
john
harmon
i
could
not
have
thought
it
i
did
know
it
but
when
i
heard
the
blows
i
thought
of
the
and
his
axe
and
had
some
dead
idea
that
i
was
lying
in
a
forest
is
still
correct
still
correct
with
the
exception
that
i
can
not
possibly
express
it
to
myself
without
using
the
word
i
but
it
was
not
i
there
was
no
such
thing
as
i
within
my
knowledge
was
only
after
a
downward
slide
through
something
like
a
tube
and
then
a
great
noise
and
a
sparkling
and
crackling
as
of
fires
that
the
consciousness
came
upon
me
this
is
john
harmon
drowning
john
harmon
struggle
for
your
life
john
harmon
call
on
heaven
and
save
yourself
i
think
i
cried
it
out
aloud
in
a
great
agony
and
then
a
heavy
horrid
unintelligible
something
vanished
and
it
was
i
who
was
struggling
there
alone
in
the
water
was
very
weak
and
faint
frightfully
oppressed
with
drowsiness
and
driving
fast
with
the
tide
looking
over
the
black
water
i
saw
the
lights
racing
past
me
on
the
two
banks
of
the
river
as
if
they
were
eager
to
be
gone
and
leave
me
dying
in
the
dark
the
tide
was
running
down
but
i
knew
nothing
of
up
or
down
then
when
guiding
myself
safely
with
heaven
assistance
before
the
fierce
set
of
the
water
i
at
last
caught
at
a
boat
moored
one
of
a
tier
of
boats
at
a
causeway
i
was
sucked
under
her
and
came
up
only
just
alive
on
the
other
side
i
long
in
the
water
long
enough
to
be
chilled
to
the
heart
but
i
do
know
how
long
yet
the
cold
was
merciful
for
it
was
the
cold
night
air
and
the
rain
that
restored
me
from
a
swoon
on
the
stones
of
the
causeway
they
naturally
supposed
me
to
have
toppled
in
drunk
when
i
crept
to
the
it
belonged
to
for
i
had
no
notion
where
i
was
and
could
not
articulate
through
the
poison
that
had
made
me
insensible
having
affected
my
speech
and
i
supposed
the
night
to
be
the
previous
night
as
it
was
still
dark
and
raining
but
i
had
lost
hours
have
checked
the
calculation
often
and
it
must
have
been
two
nights
that
i
lay
recovering
in
that
let
me
see
yes
i
am
sure
it
was
while
i
lay
in
that
bed
there
that
the
thought
entered
my
head
of
turning
the
danger
i
had
passed
through
to
the
account
of
being
for
some
time
supposed
to
have
disappeared
mysteriously
and
of
proving
bella
the
dread
of
our
being
forced
on
one
another
and
perpetuating
the
fate
that
seemed
to
have
fallen
on
my
father
riches
the
fate
that
they
should
lead
to
nothing
but
evil
was
strong
upon
the
moral
timidity
that
dates
from
my
childhood
with
my
poor
sister
to
this
hour
i
can
not
understand
that
side
of
the
river
where
i
recovered
the
shore
being
the
opposite
side
to
that
on
which
i
was
ensnared
i
shall
never
understand
it
now
even
at
this
moment
while
i
leave
the
river
behind
me
going
home
i
can
not
conceive
that
it
rolls
between
me
and
that
spot
or
that
the
sea
is
where
it
is
but
this
is
not
thinking
it
out
this
is
making
a
leap
to
the
present
time
could
not
have
done
it
but
for
the
fortune
in
the
waterproof
belt
round
my
body
not
a
great
fortune
forty
and
odd
pounds
for
the
inheritor
of
a
hundred
and
odd
thousand
but
it
was
enough
without
it
i
must
have
disclosed
myself
without
it
i
could
never
have
gone
to
that
exchequer
coffee
house
or
taken
mrs
wilfer
lodgings
twelve
days
i
lived
at
that
hotel
before
the
night
when
i
saw
the
corpse
of
radfoot
at
the
police
station
the
inexpressible
mental
horror
that
i
laboured
under
as
one
of
the
consequences
of
the
poison
makes
the
interval
seem
greatly
longer
but
i
know
it
can
not
have
been
longer
that
suffering
has
gradually
weakened
and
weakened
since
and
has
only
come
upon
me
by
starts
and
i
hope
i
am
free
from
it
now
but
even
now
i
have
sometimes
to
think
constrain
myself
and
stop
before
speaking
or
i
could
not
say
the
words
i
want
to
say
i
ramble
away
from
thinking
it
out
to
the
end
it
is
not
so
far
to
the
end
that
i
need
be
tempted
to
break
off
now
on
straight
examined
the
newspapers
every
day
for
tidings
that
i
was
missing
but
saw
none
going
out
that
night
to
walk
for
i
kept
retired
while
it
was
light
i
found
a
crowd
assembled
round
a
placard
posted
at
whitehall
it
described
myself
john
harmon
as
found
dead
and
mutilated
in
the
river
under
circumstances
of
strong
suspicion
described
my
dress
described
the
papers
in
my
pockets
and
stated
where
i
was
lying
for
recognition
in
a
wild
incautious
way
i
hurried
there
and
there
with
the
horror
of
the
death
i
had
escaped
before
my
eyes
in
its
most
appalling
shape
added
to
the
inconceivable
horror
tormenting
me
at
that
time
when
the
poisonous
stuff
was
strongest
on
me
i
perceived
that
radfoot
had
been
murdered
by
some
unknown
hands
for
the
money
for
which
he
would
have
murdered
me
and
that
probably
we
had
both
been
shot
into
the
river
from
the
same
dark
place
into
the
same
dark
tide
when
the
stream
ran
deep
and
strong
night
i
almost
gave
up
my
mystery
though
i
suspected
no
one
could
offer
no
information
knew
absolutely
nothing
save
that
the
murdered
man
was
not
i
but
radfoot
next
day
while
i
hesitated
and
next
day
while
i
hesitated
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
country
were
determined
to
have
me
dead
the
inquest
declared
me
dead
the
government
proclaimed
me
dead
i
could
not
listen
at
my
fireside
for
five
minutes
to
the
outer
noises
but
it
was
borne
into
my
ears
that
i
was
dead
john
harmon
died
and
julius
handford
disappeared
and
john
rokesmith
was
born
john
rokesmith
intent
has
been
to
repair
a
wrong
that
he
could
never
have
imagined
possible
coming
to
his
ears
through
the
lightwood
talk
related
to
him
and
which
he
is
bound
by
every
consideration
to
remedy
in
that
intent
john
rokesmith
will
persevere
as
his
duty
is
is
it
all
thought
out
all
to
this
time
nothing
omitted
no
nothing
but
beyond
this
time
to
think
it
out
through
the
future
is
a
harder
though
a
much
shorter
task
than
to
think
it
out
through
the
past
john
harmon
is
dead
should
john
harmon
come
to
life
yes
why
if
no
why
yes
first
to
enlighten
human
justice
concerning
the
offence
of
one
far
beyond
it
who
may
have
a
living
mother
to
enlighten
it
with
the
lights
of
a
stone
passage
a
flight
of
stairs
a
brown
and
a
black
man
to
come
into
possession
of
my
father
money
and
with
it
sordidly
to
buy
a
beautiful
creature
whom
i
love
i
can
not
help
it
reason
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
love
her
against
reason
but
who
would
as
soon
love
me
for
my
own
sake
as
she
would
love
the
beggar
at
the
corner
what
a
use
for
the
money
and
how
worthy
of
its
old
misuses
take
no
the
reasons
why
john
harmon
should
not
come
to
life
because
he
has
passively
allowed
these
dear
old
faithful
friends
to
pass
into
possession
of
the
property
because
he
sees
them
happy
with
it
making
a
good
use
of
it
effacing
the
old
rust
and
tarnish
on
the
money
because
they
have
virtually
adopted
bella
and
will
provide
for
her
because
there
is
affection
enough
in
her
nature
and
warmth
enough
in
her
heart
to
develop
into
something
enduringly
good
under
favourable
conditions
because
her
faults
have
been
intensified
by
her
place
in
my
father
will
and
she
is
already
growing
better
because
her
marriage
with
john
harmon
after
what
i
have
heard
from
her
own
lips
would
be
a
shocking
mockery
of
which
both
she
and
i
must
always
be
conscious
and
which
would
degrade
her
in
her
mind
and
me
in
mine
and
each
of
us
in
the
other
because
if
john
harmon
comes
to
life
and
does
not
marry
her
the
property
falls
into
the
very
hands
that
hold
it
now
would
i
have
dead
i
have
found
the
true
friends
of
my
lifetime
still
as
true
as
tender
and
as
faithful
as
when
i
was
alive
and
making
my
memory
an
incentive
to
good
actions
done
in
my
name
dead
i
have
found
them
when
they
might
have
slighted
my
name
and
passed
greedily
over
my
grave
to
ease
and
wealth
lingering
by
the
way
like
children
to
recall
their
love
for
me
when
i
was
a
poor
frightened
child
dead
i
have
heard
from
the
woman
who
would
have
been
my
wife
if
i
had
lived
the
revolting
truth
that
i
should
have
purchased
her
caring
nothing
for
me
as
a
sultan
buys
a
slave
would
i
have
if
the
dead
could
know
or
do
know
how
the
living
use
them
who
among
the
hosts
of
dead
has
found
a
more
disinterested
fidelity
on
earth
than
i
is
not
that
enough
for
me
if
i
had
come
back
these
noble
creatures
would
have
welcomed
me
wept
over
me
given
up
everything
to
me
with
joy
i
did
not
come
back
and
they
have
passed
unspoiled
into
my
place
let
them
rest
in
it
and
let
bella
rest
in
hers
course
for
me
then
this
to
live
the
same
quiet
secretary
life
carefully
avoiding
chances
of
recognition
until
they
shall
have
become
more
accustomed
to
their
altered
state
and
until
the
great
swarm
of
swindlers
under
many
names
shall
have
found
newer
prey
by
that
time
the
method
i
am
establishing
through
all
the
affairs
and
with
which
i
will
every
day
take
new
pains
to
make
them
both
familiar
will
be
i
may
hope
a
machine
in
such
working
order
as
that
they
can
keep
it
going
i
know
i
need
but
ask
of
their
generosity
to
have
when
the
right
time
comes
i
will
ask
no
more
than
will
replace
me
in
my
former
path
of
life
and
john
rokesmith
shall
tread
it
as
contentedly
as
he
may
but
john
harmon
shall
come
back
no
more
i
may
never
in
the
days
to
come
afar
off
have
any
weak
misgiving
that
bella
might
in
any
contingency
have
taken
me
for
my
own
sake
if
i
had
plainly
asked
her
i
will
plainly
ask
her
proving
beyond
all
question
what
i
already
know
too
well
and
now
it
is
all
thought
out
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
and
my
mind
is
easier
so
deeply
engaged
had
the
man
been
in
thus
communing
with
himself
that
he
had
regarded
neither
the
wind
nor
the
way
and
had
resisted
the
former
instinctively
as
he
had
pursued
the
latter
but
being
now
come
into
the
city
where
there
was
a
he
stood
irresolute
whether
to
go
to
his
lodgings
or
to
go
first
to
mr
house
he
decided
to
go
round
by
the
house
arguing
as
he
carried
his
overcoat
upon
his
arm
that
it
was
less
likely
to
attract
notice
if
left
there
than
if
taken
to
holloway
both
mrs
wilfer
and
miss
lavinia
being
ravenously
curious
touching
every
article
of
which
the
lodger
stood
possessed
arriving
at
the
house
he
found
that
mr
and
mrs
boffin
were
out
but
that
miss
wilfer
was
in
the
miss
wilfer
had
remained
at
home
in
consequence
of
not
feeling
very
well
and
had
inquired
in
the
evening
if
mr
rokesmith
were
in
his
room
my
compliments
to
miss
wilfer
and
say
i
am
here
now
miss
wilfer
compliments
came
down
in
return
and
if
it
were
not
too
much
trouble
would
mr
rokesmith
be
so
kind
as
to
come
up
before
he
went
it
was
not
too
much
trouble
and
mr
rokesmith
came
up
oh
she
looked
very
pretty
she
looked
very
very
pretty
if
the
father
of
the
late
john
harmon
had
but
left
his
money
unconditionally
to
his
son
and
if
his
son
had
but
lighted
on
this
loveable
girl
for
himself
and
had
the
happiness
to
make
her
loving
as
well
as
loveable
me
are
you
not
well
mr
rokesmith
quite
well
i
was
sorry
to
hear
when
i
came
in
that
you
were
not
mere
nothing
i
had
a
headache
gone
now
and
was
not
quite
fit
for
a
hot
theatre
so
i
stayed
at
home
i
asked
you
if
you
were
not
well
because
you
look
so
white
i
i
have
had
a
busy
evening
she
was
on
a
low
ottoman
before
the
fire
with
a
little
shining
jewel
of
a
table
and
her
book
and
her
work
beside
her
ah
what
a
different
life
the
late
john
harmon
if
it
had
been
his
happy
privilege
to
take
his
place
upon
that
ottoman
and
draw
his
arm
about
that
waist
and
say
hope
the
time
has
been
long
without
me
what
a
home
goddess
you
look
my
darling
but
the
present
john
rokesmith
far
removed
from
the
late
john
harmon
remained
standing
at
a
distance
a
little
distance
in
respect
of
space
but
a
great
distance
in
respect
of
separation
rokesmith
said
bella
taking
up
her
work
and
inspecting
it
all
round
the
corners
wanted
to
say
something
to
you
when
i
could
have
the
opportunity
as
an
explanation
why
i
was
rude
to
you
the
other
day
you
have
no
right
to
think
ill
of
me
sir
the
sharp
little
way
in
which
she
darted
a
look
at
him
half
sensitively
injured
and
half
pettishly
would
have
been
very
much
admired
by
the
late
john
harmon
do
know
how
well
i
think
of
you
miss
wilfer
you
must
have
a
very
high
opinion
of
me
mr
rokesmith
when
you
believe
that
in
prosperity
i
neglect
and
forget
my
old
home
i
believe
so
did
sir
at
any
rate
returned
bella
took
the
liberty
of
reminding
you
of
a
little
omission
into
which
you
had
fallen
insensibly
and
naturally
fallen
it
was
no
more
than
that
i
beg
leave
to
ask
you
mr
rokesmith
said
bella
you
took
that
liberty
i
hope
there
is
no
offence
in
the
phrase
it
is
your
own
remember
i
am
truly
deeply
profoundly
interested
in
you
miss
wilfer
because
i
wish
to
see
you
always
at
your
best
because
i
shall
i
go
on
sir
returned
bella
with
a
burning
face
have
said
more
than
enough
i
beg
that
you
will
not
go
on
if
you
have
any
generosity
any
honour
you
will
say
no
more
the
late
john
harmon
looking
at
the
proud
face
with
the
eyes
and
at
the
quick
breathing
as
it
stirred
the
fall
of
bright
brown
hair
over
the
beautiful
neck
would
probably
have
remained
silent
wish
to
speak
to
you
sir
said
bella
for
all
and
i
know
how
to
do
it
i
have
sat
here
all
this
evening
wishing
to
speak
to
you
and
determining
to
speak
to
you
and
feeling
that
i
must
i
beg
for
a
moment
time
he
remained
silent
and
she
remained
with
her
face
averted
sometimes
making
a
slight
movement
as
if
she
would
turn
and
speak
at
length
she
did
so
know
how
i
am
situated
here
sir
and
you
know
how
i
am
situated
at
home
i
must
speak
to
you
for
myself
since
there
is
no
one
about
me
whom
i
could
ask
to
do
so
it
is
not
generous
in
you
it
is
not
honourable
in
you
to
conduct
yourself
towards
me
as
you
do
it
ungenerous
or
dishonourable
to
be
devoted
to
you
fascinated
by
you
said
bella
the
late
john
harmon
might
have
thought
it
rather
a
contemptuous
and
lofty
word
of
repudiation
now
feel
obliged
to
go
on
pursued
the
secretary
it
were
only
in
and
i
hope
miss
wilfer
that
it
is
not
unpardonable
even
in
me
to
make
an
honest
declaration
of
an
honest
devotion
to
you
honest
declaration
repeated
bella
with
emphasis
it
otherwise
must
request
sir
said
bella
taking
refuge
in
a
touch
of
timely
resentment
i
may
not
be
questioned
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
decline
to
be
miss
wilfer
this
is
hardly
charitable
i
ask
you
nothing
but
what
your
own
emphasis
suggests
however
i
waive
even
that
question
but
what
i
have
declared
i
take
my
stand
by
i
can
not
recall
the
avowal
of
my
earnest
and
deep
attachment
to
you
and
i
do
not
recall
it
reject
it
sir
said
bella
should
be
blind
and
deaf
if
i
were
not
prepared
for
the
reply
forgive
my
offence
for
it
carries
its
punishment
with
it
punishment
asked
bella
my
present
endurance
none
but
excuse
me
i
did
not
mean
to
you
again
take
advantage
of
a
hasty
word
of
mine
said
bella
with
a
little
sting
of
make
me
seem
i
do
know
what
i
spoke
without
consideration
when
i
used
it
if
that
was
bad
i
am
sorry
but
you
repeat
it
after
consideration
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
at
least
no
better
for
the
rest
i
beg
it
may
be
understood
mr
rokesmith
that
there
is
an
end
of
this
between
us
now
and
for
ever
and
for
ever
he
repeated
i
appeal
to
you
sir
proceeded
bella
with
increasing
spirit
to
pursue
me
i
appeal
to
you
not
to
take
advantage
of
your
position
in
this
house
to
make
my
position
in
it
distressing
and
disagreeable
i
appeal
to
you
to
discontinue
your
habit
of
making
your
misplaced
attentions
as
plain
to
mrs
boffin
as
to
me
i
done
so
should
think
you
have
replied
bella
any
case
it
is
not
your
fault
if
you
have
not
mr
rokesmith
hope
you
are
wrong
in
that
impression
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
have
justified
it
i
think
i
have
not
for
the
future
there
is
no
apprehension
it
is
all
over
am
much
relieved
to
hear
it
said
bella
have
far
other
views
in
life
and
why
should
you
waste
your
own
said
the
secretary
life
his
curious
tone
caused
bella
to
glance
at
the
curious
smile
with
which
he
said
it
it
was
gone
as
he
glanced
back
me
miss
wilfer
he
proceeded
when
their
eyes
met
have
used
some
hard
words
for
which
i
do
not
doubt
you
have
a
justification
in
your
mind
that
i
do
not
understand
ungenerous
and
dishonourable
in
what
would
rather
not
be
asked
said
bella
haughtily
looking
down
would
rather
not
ask
but
the
question
is
imposed
upon
me
kindly
explain
or
if
not
kindly
justly
sir
said
bella
raising
her
eyes
to
his
after
a
little
struggle
to
forbear
it
generous
and
honourable
to
use
the
power
here
which
your
favour
with
mr
and
mrs
boffin
and
your
ability
in
your
place
give
you
against
me
you
it
generous
and
honourable
to
form
a
plan
for
gradually
bringing
their
influence
to
bear
upon
a
suit
which
i
have
shown
you
that
i
do
not
like
and
which
i
tell
you
that
i
utterly
reject
the
late
john
harmon
could
have
borne
a
good
deal
but
he
would
have
been
cut
to
the
heart
by
such
a
suspicion
as
this
it
be
generous
and
honourable
to
step
into
your
place
if
you
did
so
for
i
do
know
that
you
did
and
i
hope
you
did
not
anticipating
or
knowing
beforehand
that
i
should
come
here
and
designing
to
take
me
at
this
disadvantage
mean
and
cruel
disadvantage
said
the
secretary
assented
bella
the
secretary
kept
silence
for
a
little
while
then
merely
said
are
wholly
mistaken
miss
wilfer
wonderfully
mistaken
i
can
not
say
however
that
it
is
your
fault
if
i
deserve
better
things
of
you
you
do
not
know
it
least
sir
retorted
bella
with
her
old
indignation
rising
know
the
history
of
my
being
here
at
all
i
have
heard
mr
boffin
say
that
you
are
master
of
every
line
and
word
of
that
will
as
you
are
master
of
all
his
affairs
and
was
it
not
enough
that
i
should
have
been
willed
away
like
a
horse
or
a
dog
or
a
bird
but
must
you
too
begin
to
dispose
of
me
in
your
mind
and
speculate
in
me
as
soon
as
i
had
ceased
to
be
the
talk
and
the
laugh
of
the
town
am
i
for
ever
to
be
made
the
property
of
strangers
me
returned
the
secretary
are
wonderfully
mistaken
should
be
glad
to
know
it
answered
bella
doubt
if
you
ever
will
of
course
i
shall
be
careful
to
conceal
any
traces
of
this
interview
from
mr
and
mrs
boffin
as
long
as
i
remain
here
trust
me
what
you
have
complained
of
is
at
an
end
for
ever
am
glad
i
have
spoken
then
mr
rokesmith
it
has
been
painful
and
difficult
but
it
is
done
if
i
have
hurt
you
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
i
am
inexperienced
and
impetuous
and
i
have
been
a
little
spoilt
but
i
really
am
not
so
bad
as
i
dare
say
i
appear
or
as
you
think
me
he
quitted
the
room
when
bella
had
said
this
relenting
in
her
wilful
inconsistent
way
left
alone
she
threw
herself
back
on
her
ottoman
and
said
did
know
the
lovely
woman
was
such
a
dragon
then
she
got
up
and
looked
in
the
glass
and
said
to
her
image
have
been
positively
swelling
your
features
you
little
fool
then
she
took
an
impatient
walk
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
back
and
said
wish
pa
was
here
to
have
a
talk
about
an
avaricious
marriage
but
he
is
better
away
poor
dear
for
i
know
i
should
pull
his
hair
if
he
was
here
and
then
she
threw
her
work
away
and
threw
her
book
after
it
and
sat
down
and
hummed
a
tune
and
hummed
it
out
of
tune
and
quarrelled
with
it
and
john
rokesmith
what
did
he
he
went
down
to
his
room
and
buried
john
harmon
many
additional
fathoms
deep
he
took
his
hat
and
walked
out
and
as
he
went
to
holloway
or
anywhere
else
not
at
all
minding
where
heaped
mounds
upon
mounds
of
earth
over
john
harmon
grave
his
walking
did
not
bring
him
home
until
the
dawn
of
day
and
so
busy
had
he
been
all
night
piling
and
piling
weights
upon
weights
of
earth
above
john
harmon
grave
that
by
that
time
john
harmon
lay
buried
under
a
whole
alpine
range
and
still
the
sexton
rokesmith
accumulated
mountains
over
him
lightening
his
labour
with
the
dirge
him
crush
him
keep
him
down
chapter
strong
of
purpose
the
of
piling
earth
above
john
harmon
all
night
long
was
not
conducive
to
sound
sleep
but
rokesmith
had
some
broken
morning
rest
and
rose
strengthened
in
his
purpose
it
was
all
over
now
no
ghost
should
trouble
mr
and
mrs
boffin
peace
invisible
and
voiceless
the
ghost
should
look
on
for
a
little
while
longer
at
the
state
of
existence
out
of
which
it
had
departed
and
then
should
for
ever
cease
to
haunt
the
scenes
in
which
it
had
no
place
he
went
over
it
all
again
he
had
lapsed
into
the
condition
in
which
he
found
himself
as
many
a
man
lapses
into
many
a
condition
without
perceiving
the
accumulative
power
of
its
separate
circumstances
when
in
the
distrust
engendered
by
his
wretched
childhood
and
the
action
for
evil
never
yet
for
good
within
his
knowledge
then
of
his
father
and
his
father
wealth
on
all
within
their
influence
he
conceived
the
idea
of
his
first
deception
it
was
meant
to
be
harmless
it
was
to
last
but
a
few
hours
or
days
it
was
to
involve
in
it
only
the
girl
so
capriciously
forced
upon
him
and
upon
whom
he
was
so
capriciously
forced
and
it
was
honestly
meant
well
towards
her
for
if
he
had
found
her
unhappy
in
the
prospect
of
that
marriage
through
her
heart
inclining
to
another
man
or
for
any
other
cause
he
would
seriously
have
said
is
another
of
the
old
perverted
uses
of
the
money
i
will
let
it
go
to
my
and
my
sister
only
protectors
and
friends
when
the
snare
into
which
he
fell
so
outstripped
his
first
intention
as
that
he
found
himself
placarded
by
the
police
authorities
upon
the
london
walls
for
dead
he
confusedly
accepted
the
aid
that
fell
upon
him
without
considering
how
firmly
it
must
seem
to
fix
the
boffins
in
their
accession
to
the
fortune
when
he
saw
them
and
knew
them
and
even
from
his
of
inspection
could
find
no
flaw
in
them
he
asked
himself
shall
i
come
to
life
to
dispossess
such
people
as
these
there
was
no
good
to
set
against
the
putting
of
them
to
that
hard
proof
he
had
heard
from
bella
own
lips
when
he
stood
tapping
at
the
door
on
that
night
of
his
taking
the
lodgings
that
the
marriage
would
have
been
on
her
part
thoroughly
mercenary
he
had
since
tried
her
in
his
own
unknown
person
and
supposed
station
and
she
not
only
rejected
his
advances
but
resented
them
was
it
for
him
to
have
the
shame
of
buying
her
or
the
meanness
of
punishing
her
yet
by
coming
to
life
and
accepting
the
condition
of
the
inheritance
he
must
do
the
former
and
by
coming
to
life
and
rejecting
it
he
must
do
the
latter
another
consequence
that
he
had
never
foreshadowed
was
the
implication
of
an
innocent
man
in
his
supposed
murder
he
would
obtain
complete
retraction
from
the
accuser
and
set
the
wrong
right
but
clearly
the
wrong
could
never
have
been
done
if
he
had
never
planned
a
deception
then
whatever
inconvenience
or
distress
of
mind
the
deception
cost
him
it
was
manful
repentantly
to
accept
as
among
its
consequences
and
make
no
complaint
thus
john
rokesmith
in
the
morning
and
it
buried
john
harmon
still
many
fathoms
deeper
than
he
had
been
buried
in
the
night
going
out
earlier
than
he
was
accustomed
to
do
he
encountered
the
cherub
at
the
door
the
cherub
way
was
for
a
certain
space
his
way
and
they
walked
together
it
was
impossible
not
to
notice
the
change
in
the
cherub
appearance
the
cherub
felt
very
conscious
of
it
and
modestly
remarked
present
from
my
daughter
bella
mr
rokesmith
the
words
gave
the
secretary
a
stroke
of
pleasure
for
he
remembered
the
fifty
pounds
and
he
still
loved
the
girl
no
doubt
it
was
very
weak
it
always
is
very
weak
some
authorities
hold
but
he
loved
the
girl
do
know
whether
you
happen
to
have
read
many
books
of
african
travel
mr
rokesmith
said
have
read
several
you
know
there
usually
a
king
george
or
a
king
boy
or
a
king
sambo
or
a
king
bill
or
bull
or
rum
or
junk
or
whatever
name
the
sailors
may
have
happened
to
give
him
asked
rokesmith
anywhere
in
africa
i
mean
pretty
well
everywhere
i
may
say
for
black
kings
are
cheap
and
i
think
said
with
an
apologetic
air
am
much
of
your
opinion
mr
wilfer
you
were
going
to
say
was
going
to
say
the
king
is
generally
dressed
in
a
london
hat
only
or
a
manchester
pair
of
braces
or
one
epaulette
or
an
uniform
coat
with
his
legs
in
the
sleeves
or
something
of
that
kind
so
said
the
secretary
confidence
i
assure
you
mr
rokesmith
observed
the
cheerful
cherub
when
more
of
my
family
were
at
home
and
to
be
provided
for
i
used
to
remind
myself
immensely
of
that
king
you
have
no
idea
as
a
single
man
of
the
difficulty
i
have
had
in
wearing
more
than
one
good
article
at
a
time
can
easily
believe
it
mr
wilfer
only
mention
it
said
in
the
warmth
of
his
heart
a
proof
of
the
amiable
delicate
and
considerate
affection
of
my
daughter
bella
if
she
had
been
a
little
spoilt
i
could
have
thought
so
very
much
of
it
under
the
circumstances
but
no
not
a
bit
and
she
is
so
very
pretty
i
hope
you
agree
with
me
in
finding
her
very
pretty
mr
rokesmith
i
do
every
one
must
hope
so
said
the
cherub
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
this
is
a
great
advancement
for
her
in
life
mr
rokesmith
a
great
opening
of
her
prospects
wilfer
could
have
no
better
friends
than
mr
and
mrs
boffin
said
the
gratified
cherub
i
begin
to
think
things
are
very
well
as
they
are
if
mr
john
harmon
had
lived
is
better
dead
said
the
secretary
i
wo
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
urged
the
cherub
a
little
remonstrant
against
the
very
decisive
and
unpitying
tone
he
might
have
suited
bella
or
bella
might
have
suited
him
or
fifty
things
whereas
now
i
hope
she
can
choose
for
herself
she
as
you
place
the
confidence
in
me
of
speaking
on
the
subject
you
will
excuse
my
asking
has
she
perhaps
chosen
faltered
the
secretary
dear
no
returned
ladies
sometimes
rokesmith
hinted
without
mentioning
their
choice
to
their
fathers
in
this
case
mr
rokesmith
between
my
daughter
bella
and
me
there
is
a
regular
league
and
covenant
of
confidence
it
was
ratified
only
the
other
day
the
ratification
dates
from
these
said
the
cherub
giving
a
little
pull
at
the
lappels
of
his
coat
and
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
no
she
has
not
chosen
to
be
sure
young
george
sampson
in
the
days
when
mr
john
harmon
i
wish
had
never
been
born
said
the
secretary
with
a
gloomy
brow
looked
at
him
with
surprise
as
thinking
he
had
contracted
an
unaccountable
spite
against
the
poor
deceased
and
continued
the
days
when
mr
john
harmon
was
being
sought
out
young
george
sampson
certainly
was
hovering
about
bella
and
bella
let
him
hover
but
it
never
was
seriously
thought
of
and
it
still
less
than
ever
to
be
thought
of
now
for
bella
is
ambitious
mr
rokesmith
and
i
think
i
may
predict
will
marry
fortune
this
time
you
see
she
will
have
the
person
and
the
property
before
her
together
and
will
be
able
to
make
her
choice
with
her
eyes
open
this
is
my
road
i
am
very
sorry
to
part
company
so
soon
good
morning
sir
the
secretary
pursued
his
way
not
very
much
elevated
in
spirits
by
this
conversation
and
arriving
at
the
boffin
mansion
found
betty
higden
waiting
for
him
should
thank
you
kindly
sir
said
betty
i
might
make
so
bold
as
have
a
word
or
two
wi
you
she
should
have
as
many
words
as
she
liked
he
told
her
and
took
her
into
his
room
and
made
her
sit
down
concerning
sloppy
sir
said
betty
that
how
i
come
here
by
myself
not
wishing
him
to
know
what
i
to
say
to
you
i
got
the
start
of
him
early
and
walked
up
have
wonderful
energy
returned
rokesmith
are
as
young
as
i
am
betty
higden
gravely
shook
her
head
am
strong
for
my
time
of
life
sir
but
not
young
thank
the
lord
you
thankful
for
not
being
young
sir
if
i
was
young
it
would
all
have
to
be
gone
through
again
and
the
end
would
be
a
weary
way
off
do
you
see
but
never
mind
me
concerning
sloppy
what
about
him
betty
just
this
sir
it
ca
be
reasoned
out
of
his
head
by
any
powers
of
mine
but
what
that
he
can
do
right
by
your
kind
lady
and
gentleman
and
do
his
work
for
me
both
together
now
he
ca
to
give
himself
up
to
being
put
in
the
way
of
arning
a
good
living
and
getting
on
he
must
give
me
up
well
he
wo
respect
him
for
it
said
rokesmith
ye
sir
i
do
know
but
what
i
do
myself
still
that
do
make
it
right
to
let
him
have
his
way
so
as
he
wo
give
me
up
i
to
give
him
up
betty
to
run
away
from
him
with
an
astonished
look
at
the
indomitable
old
face
and
the
bright
eyes
the
secretary
repeated
away
from
him
sir
said
betty
with
one
nod
and
in
the
nod
and
in
the
firm
set
of
her
mouth
there
was
a
vigour
of
purpose
not
to
be
doubted
come
said
the
secretary
must
talk
about
this
let
us
take
our
time
over
it
and
try
to
get
at
the
true
sense
of
the
case
and
the
true
course
by
degrees
lookee
here
by
dear
returned
old
betty
your
excuse
for
being
so
familiar
but
being
of
a
time
of
life
to
be
your
grandmother
twice
over
now
lookee
here
is
a
poor
living
and
a
hard
as
is
to
be
got
out
of
this
work
that
i
a
doing
now
and
but
for
sloppy
i
do
know
as
i
should
have
held
to
it
this
long
but
it
did
just
keep
us
on
the
two
together
now
that
i
alone
with
even
johnny
gone
i
far
sooner
be
upon
my
feet
and
tiring
of
myself
out
than
a
sitting
folding
and
folding
by
the
fire
and
i
tell
you
why
a
deadness
steals
over
me
at
times
that
the
kind
of
life
favours
and
i
do
like
now
i
seem
to
have
johnny
in
my
arms
now
his
mother
now
his
mother
mother
now
i
seem
to
be
a
child
myself
a
lying
once
again
in
the
arms
of
my
own
mother
then
i
get
numbed
thought
and
sense
till
i
start
out
of
my
seat
afeerd
that
i
a
growing
like
the
poor
old
people
that
they
brick
up
in
the
unions
as
you
may
sometimes
see
when
they
let
out
of
the
four
walls
to
have
a
warm
in
the
sun
crawling
quite
scared
about
the
streets
i
was
a
nimble
girl
and
have
always
been
a
active
body
as
i
told
your
lady
first
time
ever
i
see
her
good
face
i
can
still
walk
twenty
mile
if
i
am
put
to
it
i
far
better
be
a
walking
than
a
getting
numbed
and
dreary
i
a
good
fair
knitter
and
can
make
many
little
things
to
sell
the
loan
from
your
lady
and
gentleman
of
twenty
shillings
to
fit
out
a
basket
with
would
be
a
fortune
for
me
trudging
round
the
country
and
tiring
of
myself
out
i
shall
keep
the
deadness
off
and
get
my
own
bread
by
my
own
labour
and
what
more
can
i
want
this
is
your
plan
said
the
secretary
running
away
me
a
better
my
deary
show
me
a
better
why
i
know
very
well
said
old
betty
higden
you
know
very
well
that
your
lady
and
gentleman
would
set
me
up
like
a
queen
for
the
rest
of
my
life
if
so
be
that
we
could
make
it
right
among
us
to
have
it
so
but
we
ca
make
it
right
among
us
to
have
it
so
i
never
took
charity
yet
nor
yet
has
any
one
belonging
to
me
and
it
would
be
forsaking
of
myself
indeed
and
forsaking
of
my
children
dead
and
gone
and
forsaking
of
their
children
dead
and
gone
to
set
up
a
contradiction
now
at
last
might
come
to
be
justifiable
and
unavoidable
at
last
the
secretary
gently
hinted
with
a
slight
stress
on
the
word
hope
it
never
will
it
ai
that
i
mean
to
give
offence
by
being
anyways
proud
said
the
old
creature
simply
that
i
want
to
be
of
a
piece
like
and
helpful
of
myself
right
through
to
my
death
to
be
sure
added
the
secretary
as
a
comfort
for
her
will
be
eagerly
looking
forward
to
his
opportunity
of
being
to
you
what
you
have
been
to
him
him
for
that
sir
said
betty
cheerfully
he
had
need
to
be
something
quick
about
it
for
i
a
getting
to
be
an
old
one
but
i
a
strong
one
too
and
travel
and
weather
never
hurt
me
yet
now
be
so
kind
as
speak
for
me
to
your
lady
and
gentleman
and
tell
what
i
ask
of
their
good
friendliness
to
let
me
do
and
why
i
ask
it
the
secretary
felt
that
there
was
no
gainsaying
what
was
urged
by
this
brave
old
heroine
and
he
presently
repaired
to
mrs
boffin
and
recommended
her
to
let
betty
higden
have
her
way
at
all
events
for
the
time
would
be
far
more
satisfactory
to
your
kind
heart
i
know
he
said
provide
for
her
but
it
may
be
a
duty
to
respect
this
independent
spirit
mrs
boffin
was
not
proof
against
the
consideration
set
before
her
she
and
her
husband
had
worked
too
and
had
brought
their
simple
faith
and
honour
clean
out
of
dustheaps
if
they
owed
a
duty
to
betty
higden
of
a
surety
that
duty
must
be
done
betty
said
mrs
boffin
when
she
accompanied
john
rokesmith
back
to
his
room
and
shone
upon
her
with
the
light
of
her
radiant
face
all
else
i
think
i
would
run
away
come
easier
to
sloppy
said
mrs
higden
shaking
her
head
come
easier
to
me
too
but
is
as
you
please
would
you
go
was
the
bright
and
ready
answer
my
deary
bless
ye
i
am
used
to
it
i
know
many
parts
of
the
country
well
when
nothing
else
was
to
be
done
i
have
worked
in
many
a
afore
now
and
in
many
a
too
i
give
my
consent
to
your
going
betty
which
mr
rokesmith
thinks
i
ought
to
do
betty
thanked
him
with
a
grateful
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
you
we
must
not
let
you
pass
out
of
our
knowledge
we
must
know
all
about
you
my
deary
but
not
through
because
indeed
writing
of
most
sorts
had
much
come
up
for
such
as
me
when
i
was
young
but
i
shall
be
to
and
fro
no
fear
of
my
missing
a
chance
of
giving
myself
a
sight
of
your
reviving
face
besides
said
betty
with
logical
good
faith
shall
have
a
debt
to
pay
off
by
littles
and
naturally
that
would
bring
me
back
if
nothing
else
would
it
be
done
asked
mrs
boffin
still
reluctant
of
the
secretary
think
it
must
after
more
discussion
it
was
agreed
that
it
should
be
done
and
mrs
boffin
summoned
bella
to
note
down
the
little
purchases
that
were
necessary
to
set
betty
up
in
trade
ye
be
timorous
for
me
my
dear
said
the
stanch
old
heart
observant
of
bella
face
i
take
my
seat
with
my
work
clean
and
busy
and
fresh
in
a
country
i
shall
turn
a
sixpence
as
sure
as
ever
a
farmer
wife
there
the
secretary
took
that
opportunity
of
touching
on
the
practical
question
of
mr
sloppy
capabilities
he
would
have
made
a
wonderful
said
mrs
higden
there
had
been
the
money
to
put
him
to
it
she
had
seen
him
handle
tools
that
he
had
borrowed
to
mend
the
mangle
or
to
knock
a
broken
piece
of
furniture
together
in
a
surprising
manner
as
to
constructing
toys
for
the
minders
out
of
nothing
he
had
done
that
daily
and
once
as
many
as
a
dozen
people
had
got
together
in
the
lane
to
see
the
neatness
with
which
he
fitted
the
broken
pieces
of
a
foreign
monkey
musical
instrument
well
said
the
secretary
will
not
be
hard
to
find
a
trade
for
him
john
harmon
being
buried
under
mountains
now
the
secretary
that
very
same
day
set
himself
to
finish
his
affairs
and
have
done
with
him
he
drew
up
an
ample
declaration
to
be
signed
by
rogue
riderhood
knowing
he
could
get
his
signature
to
it
by
making
him
another
and
much
shorter
evening
call
and
then
considered
to
whom
should
he
give
the
document
to
hexam
son
or
daughter
resolved
speedily
to
the
daughter
but
it
would
be
safer
to
avoid
seeing
the
daughter
because
the
son
had
seen
julius
handford
and
he
could
not
be
too
careful
there
might
possibly
be
some
comparison
of
notes
between
the
son
and
daughter
which
would
awaken
slumbering
suspicion
and
lead
to
consequences
might
even
he
reflected
apprehended
as
having
been
concerned
in
my
own
murder
therefore
best
to
send
it
to
the
daughter
under
cover
by
the
post
pleasant
riderhood
had
undertaken
to
find
out
where
she
lived
and
it
was
not
necessary
that
it
should
be
attended
by
a
single
word
of
explanation
so
far
straight
but
all
that
he
knew
of
the
daughter
he
derived
from
mrs
accounts
of
what
she
heard
from
mr
lightwood
who
seemed
to
have
a
reputation
for
his
manner
of
relating
a
story
and
to
have
made
this
story
quite
his
own
it
interested
him
and
he
would
like
to
have
the
means
of
knowing
more
as
for
instance
that
she
received
the
exonerating
paper
and
that
it
satisfied
her
by
opening
some
channel
altogether
independent
of
lightwood
who
likewise
had
seen
julius
handford
who
had
publicly
advertised
for
julius
handford
and
whom
of
all
men
he
the
secretary
most
avoided
with
whom
the
common
course
of
things
might
bring
me
in
a
moment
face
to
face
any
day
in
the
week
or
any
hour
in
the
day
now
to
cast
about
for
some
likely
means
of
opening
such
a
channel
the
boy
hexam
was
training
for
and
with
a
schoolmaster
the
secretary
knew
it
because
his
sister
share
in
that
disposal
of
him
seemed
to
be
the
best
part
of
lightwood
account
of
the
family
this
young
fellow
sloppy
stood
in
need
of
some
instruction
if
he
the
secretary
engaged
that
schoolmaster
to
impart
it
to
him
the
channel
might
be
opened
the
next
point
was
did
mrs
boffin
know
the
schoolmaster
name
no
but
she
knew
where
the
school
was
quite
enough
promptly
the
secretary
wrote
to
the
master
of
that
school
and
that
very
evening
bradley
headstone
answered
in
person
the
secretary
stated
to
the
schoolmaster
how
the
object
was
to
send
to
him
for
certain
occasional
evening
instruction
a
youth
whom
mr
and
mrs
boffin
wished
to
help
to
an
industrious
and
useful
place
in
life
the
schoolmaster
was
willing
to
undertake
the
charge
of
such
a
pupil
the
secretary
inquired
on
what
terms
the
schoolmaster
stated
on
what
terms
agreed
and
disposed
of
i
ask
sir
said
bradley
headstone
whose
good
opinion
i
owe
a
recommendation
to
you
should
know
that
i
am
not
the
principal
here
i
am
mr
secretary
mr
boffin
is
a
gentleman
who
inherited
a
property
of
which
you
may
have
heard
some
public
mention
the
harmon
property
harmon
said
bradley
who
would
have
been
a
great
deal
more
at
a
loss
than
he
was
if
he
had
known
to
whom
he
spoke
murdered
and
found
in
the
river
murdered
and
found
in
the
river
was
not
interposed
the
secretary
smiling
was
not
he
who
recommended
you
mr
boffin
heard
of
you
through
a
certain
mr
lightwood
i
think
you
know
mr
lightwood
or
know
of
him
know
as
much
of
him
as
i
wish
to
know
sir
i
have
no
acquaintance
with
mr
lightwood
and
i
desire
none
i
have
no
objection
to
mr
lightwood
but
i
have
a
particular
objection
to
some
of
mr
friends
in
short
to
one
of
mr
lightwood
friends
his
great
friend
he
could
hardly
get
the
words
out
even
then
and
there
so
fierce
did
he
grow
though
keeping
himself
down
with
infinite
pains
of
repression
when
the
careless
and
contemptuous
bearing
of
eugene
wrayburn
rose
before
his
mind
the
secretary
saw
there
was
a
strong
feeling
here
on
some
sore
point
and
he
would
have
made
a
diversion
from
it
but
for
bradley
holding
to
it
in
his
cumbersome
way
have
no
objection
to
mention
the
friend
by
name
he
said
doggedly
person
i
object
to
is
mr
eugene
wrayburn
the
secretary
remembered
him
in
his
disturbed
recollection
of
that
night
when
he
was
striving
against
the
drugged
drink
there
was
but
a
dim
image
of
eugene
person
but
he
remembered
his
name
and
his
manner
of
speaking
and
how
he
had
gone
with
them
to
view
the
body
and
where
he
had
stood
and
what
he
had
said
mr
headstone
what
is
the
name
he
asked
again
trying
to
make
a
diversion
young
hexam
sister
name
is
lizzie
said
the
schoolmaster
with
a
strong
contraction
of
his
whole
face
is
a
young
woman
of
a
remarkable
character
is
she
not
is
sufficiently
remarkable
to
be
very
superior
to
mr
eugene
wrayburn
though
an
ordinary
person
might
be
that
said
the
schoolmaster
i
hope
you
will
not
think
it
impertinent
in
me
sir
to
ask
why
you
put
the
two
names
together
mere
accident
returned
the
secretary
that
mr
wrayburn
was
a
disagreeable
subject
with
you
i
tried
to
get
away
from
it
though
not
very
successfully
it
would
appear
you
know
mr
wrayburn
sir
perhaps
the
names
can
not
be
put
together
on
the
authority
of
any
representation
of
his
not
took
the
liberty
to
ask
said
bradley
after
casting
his
eyes
on
the
ground
he
is
capable
of
making
any
representation
in
the
swaggering
levity
of
his
insolence
i
i
hope
you
will
not
misunderstand
me
sir
i
i
am
much
interested
in
this
brother
and
sister
and
the
subject
awakens
very
strong
feelings
within
me
very
very
strong
feelings
with
a
shaking
hand
bradley
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
brow
the
secretary
thought
as
he
glanced
at
the
schoolmaster
face
that
he
had
opened
a
channel
here
indeed
and
that
it
was
an
unexpectedly
dark
and
deep
and
stormy
one
and
difficult
to
sound
all
at
once
in
the
midst
of
his
turbulent
emotions
bradley
stopped
and
seemed
to
challenge
his
look
much
as
though
he
suddenly
asked
him
do
you
see
in
me
brother
young
hexam
was
your
real
recommendation
here
said
the
secretary
quietly
going
back
to
the
point
and
mrs
boffin
happening
to
know
through
mr
lightwood
that
he
was
your
pupil
anything
that
i
ask
respecting
the
brother
and
sister
or
either
of
them
i
ask
for
myself
out
of
my
own
interest
in
the
subject
and
not
in
my
official
character
or
on
mr
boffin
behalf
how
i
come
to
be
interested
i
need
not
explain
you
know
the
father
connection
with
the
discovery
of
mr
harmon
body
replied
bradley
very
restlessly
indeed
know
all
the
circumstances
of
that
case
tell
me
mr
headstone
said
the
secretary
the
sister
suffer
under
any
stigma
because
of
the
impossible
accusation
groundless
would
be
a
better
word
that
was
made
against
the
father
and
substantially
withdrawn
sir
returned
bradley
with
a
kind
of
anger
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
sister
said
bradley
separating
his
words
and
speaking
as
if
he
were
repeating
them
from
a
book
under
no
reproach
that
repels
a
man
of
unimpeachable
character
who
had
made
for
himself
every
step
of
his
way
in
life
from
placing
her
in
his
own
station
i
will
not
say
raising
her
to
his
own
station
i
say
placing
her
in
it
the
sister
labours
under
no
reproach
unless
she
should
unfortunately
make
it
for
herself
when
such
a
man
is
not
deterred
from
regarding
her
as
his
equal
and
when
he
has
convinced
himself
that
there
is
no
blemish
on
her
i
think
the
fact
must
be
taken
to
be
pretty
expressive
there
is
such
a
man
said
the
secretary
bradley
headstone
knotted
his
brows
and
squared
his
large
lower
jaw
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
ground
with
an
air
of
determination
that
seemed
unnecessary
to
the
occasion
as
he
replied
there
is
such
a
man
the
secretary
had
no
reason
or
excuse
for
prolonging
the
conversation
and
it
ended
here
within
three
hours
the
apparition
once
more
dived
into
the
leaving
shop
and
that
night
rogue
recantation
lay
in
the
post
office
addressed
under
cover
to
lizzie
hexam
at
her
right
address
all
these
proceedings
occupied
john
rokesmith
so
much
that
it
was
not
until
the
following
day
that
he
saw
bella
again
it
seemed
then
to
be
tacitly
understood
between
them
that
they
were
to
be
as
distantly
easy
as
they
could
without
attracting
the
attention
of
mr
and
mrs
boffin
to
any
marked
change
in
their
manner
the
fitting
out
of
old
betty
higden
was
favourable
to
this
as
keeping
bella
engaged
and
interested
and
as
occupying
the
general
attention
think
said
rokesmith
when
they
all
stood
about
her
while
she
packed
her
tidy
basket
except
bella
who
was
busily
helping
on
her
knees
at
the
chair
on
which
it
stood
at
least
you
might
keep
a
letter
in
your
pocket
mrs
higden
which
i
would
write
for
you
and
date
from
here
merely
stating
in
the
names
of
mr
and
mrs
boffin
that
they
are
your
friends
i
wo
say
patrons
because
they
would
like
it
no
no
said
mr
boffin
patronizing
let
keep
out
of
that
whatever
we
come
to
more
than
enough
of
that
about
without
us
ai
there
noddy
said
mrs
boffin
believe
you
old
lady
returned
the
golden
dustman
indeed
people
sometimes
like
to
be
patronized
do
they
sir
asked
bella
looking
up
do
and
if
they
do
my
dear
they
ought
to
learn
better
said
mr
boffin
and
patronesses
and
and
and
deceased
patrons
and
deceased
patronesses
and
and
what
does
it
all
mean
in
the
books
of
the
charities
that
come
pouring
in
on
rokesmith
as
he
sits
among
pretty
well
up
to
his
neck
if
mr
tom
noakes
gives
his
five
shillings
ai
he
a
patron
and
if
mrs
jack
styles
gives
her
five
shillings
ai
she
a
patroness
what
the
deuce
is
it
all
about
if
it
ai
stark
staring
impudence
what
do
you
call
it
be
warm
noddy
mrs
boffin
urged
cried
mr
boffin
enough
to
make
a
man
smoking
hot
i
go
anywhere
without
being
patronized
i
do
want
to
be
patronized
if
i
buy
a
ticket
for
a
flower
show
or
a
music
show
or
any
sort
of
show
and
pay
pretty
heavy
for
it
why
am
i
to
be
patroned
and
patronessed
as
if
the
patrons
and
patronesses
treated
me
if
there
a
good
thing
to
be
done
ca
it
be
done
on
its
own
merits
if
there
a
bad
thing
to
be
done
can
it
ever
be
patroned
and
patronessed
right
yet
when
a
new
institution
going
to
be
built
it
seems
to
me
that
the
bricks
and
mortar
ai
made
of
half
so
much
consequence
as
the
patrons
and
patronesses
no
nor
yet
the
objects
i
wish
somebody
would
tell
me
whether
other
countries
get
patronized
to
anything
like
the
extent
of
this
one
and
as
to
the
patrons
and
patronesses
themselves
i
wonder
they
not
ashamed
of
themselves
they
ai
pills
or
or
invigorating
nervous
essences
to
be
puffed
in
that
way
having
delivered
himself
of
these
remarks
mr
boffin
took
a
trot
according
to
his
usual
custom
and
trotted
back
to
the
spot
from
which
he
had
started
to
the
letter
rokesmith
said
mr
boffin
as
right
as
a
trivet
give
her
the
letter
make
her
take
the
letter
put
it
in
her
pocket
by
violence
she
might
fall
sick
you
know
you
might
fall
sick
said
mr
boffin
deny
it
mrs
higden
in
your
obstinacy
you
know
you
might
old
betty
laughed
and
said
that
she
would
take
the
letter
and
be
thankful
right
said
mr
boffin
that
sensible
and
do
be
thankful
to
us
for
we
never
thought
of
it
but
to
mr
rokesmith
the
letter
was
written
and
read
to
her
and
given
to
her
how
do
you
feel
said
mr
boffin
you
like
it
letter
sir
said
betty
it
a
beautiful
letter
no
no
not
the
letter
said
mr
boffin
idea
are
you
sure
you
strong
enough
to
carry
out
the
idea
shall
be
stronger
and
keep
the
deadness
off
better
this
way
than
any
way
left
open
to
me
sir
say
than
any
way
left
open
you
know
urged
mr
boffin
there
are
ways
without
end
a
housekeeper
would
be
acceptable
over
yonder
at
the
bower
for
instance
would
you
like
to
see
the
bower
and
know
a
retired
literary
man
of
the
name
of
wegg
that
lives
there
with
a
wooden
leg
old
betty
was
proof
even
against
this
temptation
and
fell
to
adjusting
her
black
bonnet
and
shawl
would
let
you
go
now
it
comes
to
this
after
all
said
mr
boffin
i
did
hope
that
it
may
make
a
man
and
a
workman
of
sloppy
in
as
short
a
time
as
ever
a
man
and
workman
was
made
yet
why
what
have
you
got
there
betty
not
a
doll
it
was
the
man
in
the
guards
who
had
been
on
duty
over
johnny
bed
the
solitary
old
woman
showed
what
it
was
and
put
it
up
quietly
in
her
dress
then
she
gratefully
took
leave
of
mrs
boffin
and
of
mr
boffin
and
of
rokesmith
and
then
put
her
old
withered
arms
round
bella
young
and
blooming
neck
and
said
repeating
johnny
words
kiss
for
the
boofer
lady
the
secretary
looked
on
from
a
doorway
at
the
boofer
lady
thus
encircled
and
still
looked
on
at
the
boofer
lady
standing
alone
there
when
the
determined
old
figure
with
its
steady
bright
eyes
was
trudging
through
the
streets
away
from
paralysis
and
pauperism
chapter
the
whole
case
so
far
bradley
headstone
held
fast
by
that
other
interview
he
was
to
have
with
lizzie
hexam
in
stipulating
for
it
he
had
been
impelled
by
a
feeling
little
short
of
desperation
and
the
feeling
abided
by
him
it
was
very
soon
after
his
interview
with
the
secretary
that
he
and
charley
hexam
set
out
one
leaden
evening
not
unnoticed
by
miss
peecher
to
have
this
desperate
interview
accomplished
dolls
dressmaker
said
bradley
favourable
neither
to
me
nor
to
you
hexam
pert
crooked
little
chit
mr
headstone
i
knew
she
would
put
herself
in
the
way
if
she
could
and
would
be
sure
to
strike
in
with
something
impertinent
it
was
on
that
account
that
i
proposed
our
going
to
the
city
and
meeting
my
sister
i
supposed
said
bradley
getting
his
gloves
on
his
nervous
hands
as
he
walked
i
supposed
but
my
sister
pursued
charley
have
found
out
such
an
extraordinary
companion
she
has
done
it
in
a
ridiculous
fancy
of
giving
herself
up
to
another
she
told
me
so
that
night
when
we
went
there
should
she
give
herself
up
to
the
dressmaker
asked
bradley
said
the
boy
colouring
of
her
romantic
ideas
i
tried
to
convince
her
so
but
i
did
succeed
however
what
we
have
got
to
do
is
to
succeed
mr
headstone
and
then
all
the
rest
follows
are
still
sanguine
hexam
i
am
sir
why
we
have
everything
on
our
side
your
sister
perhaps
thought
bradley
but
he
only
gloomily
thought
it
and
said
nothing
on
our
side
repeated
the
boy
with
boyish
confidence
an
excellent
connexion
for
me
common
sense
everything
be
sure
your
sister
has
always
shown
herself
a
devoted
sister
said
bradley
willing
to
sustain
himself
on
even
that
low
ground
of
hope
mr
headstone
i
have
a
good
deal
of
influence
with
her
and
now
that
you
have
honoured
me
with
your
confidence
and
spoken
to
me
first
i
say
again
we
have
everything
on
our
side
and
bradley
thought
again
your
sister
perhaps
a
grey
dusty
withered
evening
in
london
city
has
not
a
hopeful
aspect
the
closed
warehouses
and
offices
have
an
air
of
death
about
them
and
the
national
dread
of
colour
has
an
air
of
mourning
the
towers
and
steeples
of
the
many
churches
dark
and
dingy
as
the
sky
that
seems
descending
on
them
are
no
relief
to
the
general
gloom
a
on
a
has
the
look
in
its
useless
black
shade
of
having
failed
in
its
business
enterprise
and
stopped
payment
for
ever
melancholy
waifs
and
strays
of
housekeepers
and
porter
sweep
melancholy
waifs
and
strays
of
papers
and
pins
into
the
kennels
and
other
more
melancholy
waifs
and
strays
explore
them
searching
and
stooping
and
poking
for
anything
to
sell
the
set
of
humanity
outward
from
the
city
is
as
a
set
of
prisoners
departing
from
gaol
and
dismal
newgate
seems
quite
as
fit
a
stronghold
for
the
mighty
lord
mayor
as
his
own
on
such
an
evening
when
the
city
grit
gets
into
the
hair
and
eyes
and
skin
and
when
the
fallen
leaves
of
the
few
unhappy
city
trees
grind
down
in
corners
under
wheels
of
wind
the
schoolmaster
and
the
pupil
emerged
upon
the
leadenhall
street
region
spying
eastward
for
lizzie
being
something
too
soon
in
their
arrival
they
lurked
at
a
corner
waiting
for
her
to
appear
the
among
us
will
not
look
very
well
lurking
at
a
corner
and
bradley
came
out
of
that
disadvantage
very
poorly
indeed
she
comes
mr
headstone
let
us
go
forward
and
meet
her
as
they
advanced
she
saw
them
coming
and
seemed
rather
troubled
but
she
greeted
her
brother
with
the
usual
warmth
and
touched
the
extended
hand
of
bradley
where
are
you
going
charley
dear
she
asked
him
then
we
came
on
purpose
to
meet
you
meet
me
charley
we
are
going
to
walk
with
you
but
do
let
us
take
the
great
leading
streets
where
every
one
walks
and
we
ca
hear
ourselves
speak
let
us
go
by
the
quiet
backways
here
a
large
paved
court
by
this
church
and
quiet
too
let
us
go
up
here
it
not
in
the
way
charley
it
is
said
the
boy
petulantly
in
my
way
and
my
way
is
yours
she
had
not
released
his
hand
and
still
holding
it
looked
at
him
with
a
kind
of
appeal
he
avoided
her
eyes
under
pretence
of
saying
along
mr
headstone
bradley
walked
at
his
side
not
at
hers
and
the
brother
and
sister
walked
hand
in
hand
the
court
brought
them
to
a
churchyard
a
paved
square
court
with
a
raised
bank
of
earth
about
breast
high
in
the
middle
enclosed
by
iron
rails
here
conveniently
and
healthfully
elevated
above
the
level
of
the
living
were
the
dead
and
the
tombstones
some
of
the
latter
droopingly
inclined
from
the
perpendicular
as
if
they
were
ashamed
of
the
lies
they
told
they
paced
the
whole
of
this
place
once
in
a
constrained
and
uncomfortable
manner
when
the
boy
stopped
and
said
mr
headstone
has
something
to
say
to
you
i
do
wish
to
be
an
interruption
either
to
him
or
to
you
and
so
i
go
and
take
a
little
stroll
and
come
back
i
know
in
a
general
way
what
mr
headstone
intends
to
say
and
i
very
highly
approve
of
it
as
i
hope
and
indeed
i
do
not
doubt
you
will
i
need
tell
you
lizzie
that
i
am
under
great
obligations
to
mr
headstone
and
that
i
am
very
anxious
for
mr
headstone
to
succeed
in
all
he
undertakes
as
i
hope
and
as
indeed
i
doubt
you
must
be
returned
his
sister
detaining
his
hand
as
he
withdrew
it
think
you
had
better
stay
i
think
mr
headstone
had
better
not
say
what
he
thinks
of
saying
how
do
you
know
what
it
is
returned
the
boy
i
do
but
you
do
no
liz
i
should
think
not
if
you
knew
what
it
was
you
would
give
me
a
very
different
answer
there
let
go
be
sensible
i
wonder
you
do
remember
that
mr
headstone
is
looking
on
she
allowed
him
to
separate
himself
from
her
and
he
after
saying
liz
be
a
rational
girl
and
a
good
sister
walked
away
she
remained
standing
alone
with
bradley
headstone
and
it
was
not
until
she
raised
her
eyes
that
he
spoke
said
he
began
i
saw
you
last
that
there
was
something
unexplained
which
might
perhaps
influence
you
i
have
come
this
evening
to
explain
it
i
hope
you
will
not
judge
of
me
by
my
hesitating
manner
when
i
speak
to
you
you
see
me
at
my
greatest
disadvantage
it
is
most
unfortunate
for
me
that
i
wish
you
to
see
me
at
my
best
and
that
i
know
you
see
me
at
my
worst
she
moved
slowly
on
when
he
paused
and
he
moved
slowly
on
beside
her
seems
egotistical
to
begin
by
saying
so
much
about
myself
he
resumed
whatever
i
say
to
you
seems
even
in
my
own
ears
below
what
i
want
to
say
and
different
from
what
i
want
to
say
i
ca
help
it
so
it
is
you
are
the
ruin
of
me
she
started
at
the
passionate
sound
of
the
last
words
and
at
the
passionate
action
of
his
hands
with
which
they
were
accompanied
you
are
the
ruin
the
ruin
the
ruin
of
me
i
have
no
resources
in
myself
i
have
no
confidence
in
myself
i
have
no
government
of
myself
when
you
are
near
me
or
in
my
thoughts
and
you
are
always
in
my
thoughts
now
i
have
never
been
quit
of
you
since
i
first
saw
you
oh
that
was
a
wretched
day
for
me
that
was
a
wretched
miserable
day
a
touch
of
pity
for
him
mingled
with
her
dislike
of
him
and
she
said
headstone
i
am
grieved
to
have
done
you
any
harm
but
i
have
never
meant
it
he
cried
despairingly
i
seem
to
have
reproached
you
instead
of
revealing
to
you
the
state
of
my
own
mind
bear
with
me
i
am
always
wrong
when
you
are
in
question
it
is
my
doom
struggling
with
himself
and
by
times
looking
up
at
the
deserted
windows
of
the
houses
as
if
there
could
be
anything
written
in
their
grimy
panes
that
would
help
him
he
paced
the
whole
pavement
at
her
side
before
he
spoke
again
must
try
to
give
expression
to
what
is
in
my
mind
it
shall
and
must
be
spoken
though
you
see
me
so
confounded
though
you
strike
me
so
helpless
i
ask
you
to
believe
that
there
are
many
people
who
think
well
of
me
that
there
are
some
people
who
highly
esteem
me
that
i
have
in
my
way
won
a
station
which
is
considered
worth
winning
mr
headstone
i
do
believe
it
surely
i
have
always
known
it
from
charley
ask
you
to
believe
that
if
i
were
to
offer
my
home
such
as
it
is
my
station
such
as
it
is
my
affections
such
as
they
are
to
any
one
of
the
best
considered
and
best
qualified
and
most
distinguished
among
the
young
women
engaged
in
my
calling
they
would
probably
be
accepted
even
readily
accepted
do
not
doubt
it
said
lizzie
with
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
have
sometimes
had
it
in
my
thoughts
to
make
that
offer
and
to
settle
down
as
many
men
of
my
class
do
i
on
the
one
side
of
a
school
my
wife
on
the
other
both
of
us
interested
in
the
same
work
have
you
not
done
so
asked
lizzie
hexam
do
you
not
do
so
better
that
i
never
did
the
only
one
grain
of
comfort
i
have
had
these
many
weeks
he
said
always
speaking
passionately
and
when
most
emphatic
repeating
that
former
action
of
his
hands
which
was
like
flinging
his
heart
blood
down
before
her
in
drops
upon
the
only
one
grain
of
comfort
i
have
had
these
many
weeks
is
that
i
never
did
for
if
i
had
and
if
the
same
spell
had
come
upon
me
for
my
ruin
i
know
i
should
have
broken
that
tie
asunder
as
if
it
had
been
thread
she
glanced
at
him
with
a
glance
of
fear
and
a
shrinking
gesture
he
answered
as
if
she
had
spoken
it
would
not
have
been
voluntary
on
my
part
any
more
than
it
is
voluntary
in
me
to
be
here
now
you
draw
me
to
you
if
i
were
shut
up
in
a
strong
prison
you
would
draw
me
out
i
should
break
through
the
wall
to
come
to
you
if
i
were
lying
on
a
sick
bed
you
would
draw
me
up
to
stagger
to
your
feet
and
fall
there
the
wild
energy
of
the
man
now
quite
let
loose
was
absolutely
terrible
he
stopped
and
laid
his
hand
upon
a
piece
of
the
coping
of
the
enclosure
as
if
he
would
have
dislodged
the
stone
man
knows
till
the
time
comes
what
depths
are
within
him
to
some
men
it
never
comes
let
them
rest
and
be
thankful
to
me
you
brought
it
on
me
you
forced
it
and
the
bottom
of
this
raging
sea
striking
himself
upon
the
breast
been
heaved
up
ever
since
headstone
i
have
heard
enough
let
me
stop
you
here
it
will
be
better
for
you
and
better
for
me
let
us
find
my
brother
yet
it
shall
and
must
be
spoken
i
have
been
in
torments
ever
since
i
stopped
short
of
it
before
you
are
alarmed
it
is
another
of
my
miseries
that
i
can
not
speak
to
you
or
speak
of
you
without
stumbling
at
every
syllable
unless
i
let
the
check
go
altogether
and
run
mad
here
is
a
man
lighting
the
lamps
he
will
be
gone
directly
i
entreat
of
you
let
us
walk
round
this
place
again
you
have
no
reason
to
look
alarmed
i
can
restrain
myself
and
i
will
she
yielded
to
the
entreaty
how
could
she
do
otherwise
and
they
paced
the
stones
in
silence
one
by
one
the
lights
leaped
up
making
the
cold
grey
church
tower
more
remote
and
they
were
alone
again
he
said
no
more
until
they
had
regained
the
spot
where
he
had
broken
off
there
he
again
stood
still
and
again
grasped
the
stone
in
saying
what
he
said
then
he
never
looked
at
her
but
looked
at
it
and
wrenched
at
it
know
what
i
am
going
to
say
i
love
you
what
other
men
may
mean
when
they
use
that
expression
i
can
not
tell
what
i
mean
is
that
i
am
under
the
influence
of
some
tremendous
attraction
which
i
have
resisted
in
vain
and
which
overmasters
me
you
could
draw
me
to
fire
you
could
draw
me
to
water
you
could
draw
me
to
the
gallows
you
could
draw
me
to
any
death
you
could
draw
me
to
anything
i
have
most
avoided
you
could
draw
me
to
any
exposure
and
disgrace
this
and
the
confusion
of
my
thoughts
so
that
i
am
fit
for
nothing
is
what
i
mean
by
your
being
the
ruin
of
me
but
if
you
would
return
a
favourable
answer
to
my
offer
of
myself
in
marriage
you
could
draw
me
to
any
good
every
good
with
equal
force
my
circumstances
are
quite
easy
and
you
would
want
for
nothing
my
reputation
stands
quite
high
and
would
be
a
shield
for
yours
if
you
saw
me
at
my
work
able
to
do
it
well
and
respected
in
it
you
might
even
come
to
take
a
sort
of
pride
in
me
i
would
try
hard
that
you
should
whatever
considerations
i
may
have
thought
of
against
this
offer
i
have
conquered
and
i
make
it
with
all
my
heart
your
brother
favours
me
to
the
utmost
and
it
is
likely
that
we
might
live
and
work
together
anyhow
it
is
certain
that
he
would
have
my
best
influence
and
support
i
do
know
what
i
could
say
more
if
i
tried
i
might
only
weaken
what
is
ill
enough
said
as
it
is
i
only
add
that
if
it
is
any
claim
on
you
to
be
in
earnest
i
am
in
thorough
earnest
dreadful
earnest
the
powdered
mortar
from
under
the
stone
at
which
he
wrenched
rattled
on
the
pavement
to
confirm
his
words
headstone
i
implore
you
before
you
answer
me
to
walk
round
this
place
once
more
it
will
give
you
a
minute
time
to
think
and
me
a
time
to
get
some
fortitude
together
again
she
yielded
to
the
entreaty
and
again
they
came
back
to
the
same
place
and
again
he
worked
at
the
stone
it
he
said
with
his
attention
apparently
engrossed
by
it
or
no
headstone
i
thank
you
sincerely
i
thank
you
gratefully
and
hope
you
may
find
a
worthy
wife
before
long
and
be
very
happy
but
it
is
no
no
short
time
necessary
for
reflection
no
weeks
or
days
he
asked
in
the
same
way
whatever
you
quite
decided
and
is
there
no
chance
of
any
change
in
my
favour
am
quite
decided
mr
headstone
and
i
am
bound
to
answer
i
am
certain
there
is
none
said
he
suddenly
changing
his
tone
and
turning
to
her
and
bringing
his
clenched
hand
down
upon
the
stone
with
a
force
that
laid
the
knuckles
raw
and
bleeding
i
hope
that
i
may
never
kill
him
the
dark
look
of
hatred
and
revenge
with
which
the
words
broke
from
his
livid
lips
and
with
which
he
stood
holding
out
his
smeared
hand
as
if
it
held
some
weapon
and
had
just
struck
a
mortal
blow
made
her
so
afraid
of
him
that
she
turned
to
run
away
but
he
caught
her
by
the
arm
headstone
let
me
go
mr
headstone
i
must
call
for
help
is
i
who
should
call
for
help
he
said
do
know
yet
how
much
i
need
it
the
working
of
his
face
as
she
shrank
from
it
glancing
round
for
her
brother
and
uncertain
what
to
do
might
have
extorted
a
cry
from
her
in
another
instant
but
all
at
once
he
sternly
stopped
it
and
fixed
it
as
if
death
itself
had
done
so
you
see
i
have
recovered
myself
hear
me
out
with
much
of
the
dignity
of
courage
as
she
recalled
her
life
and
her
right
to
be
free
from
accountability
to
this
man
she
released
her
arm
from
his
grasp
and
stood
looking
full
at
him
she
had
never
been
so
handsome
in
his
eyes
a
shade
came
over
them
while
he
looked
back
at
her
as
if
she
drew
the
very
light
out
of
them
to
herself
time
at
least
i
will
leave
nothing
unsaid
he
went
on
folding
his
hands
before
him
clearly
to
prevent
his
being
betrayed
into
any
impetuous
gesture
last
time
at
least
i
will
not
be
tortured
with
of
a
lost
opportunity
mr
eugene
wrayburn
it
of
him
you
spoke
in
your
ungovernable
rage
and
violence
lizzie
hexam
demanded
with
spirit
he
bit
his
lip
and
looked
at
her
and
said
never
a
word
it
mr
wrayburn
that
you
threatened
he
bit
his
lip
again
and
looked
at
her
and
said
never
a
word
asked
me
to
hear
you
out
and
you
will
not
speak
let
me
find
my
brother
i
threatened
no
one
her
look
dropped
for
an
instant
to
his
bleeding
hand
he
lifted
it
to
his
mouth
wiped
it
on
his
sleeve
and
again
folded
it
over
the
other
eugene
wrayburn
he
repeated
do
you
mention
that
name
again
and
again
mr
headstone
it
is
the
text
of
the
little
i
have
left
to
say
observe
there
are
no
threats
in
it
if
i
utter
a
threat
stop
me
and
fasten
it
upon
me
mr
eugene
wrayburn
a
worse
threat
than
was
conveyed
in
his
manner
of
uttering
the
name
could
hardly
have
escaped
him
haunts
you
you
accept
favours
from
him
you
are
willing
enough
to
listen
to
him
i
know
it
as
well
as
he
does
wrayburn
has
been
considerate
and
good
to
me
sir
said
lizzie
proudly
connexion
with
the
death
and
with
the
memory
of
my
poor
father
doubt
he
is
of
course
a
very
considerate
and
a
very
good
man
mr
eugene
wrayburn
is
nothing
to
you
i
think
said
lizzie
with
an
indignation
she
could
not
repress
yes
he
is
there
you
mistake
he
is
much
to
me
can
he
be
to
you
can
be
a
rival
to
me
among
other
things
said
bradley
headstone
returned
lizzie
with
a
burning
face
is
cowardly
in
you
to
speak
to
me
in
this
way
but
it
makes
me
able
to
tell
you
that
i
do
not
like
you
and
that
i
never
have
liked
you
from
the
first
and
that
no
other
living
creature
has
anything
to
do
with
the
effect
you
have
produced
upon
me
for
yourself
his
head
bent
for
a
moment
as
if
under
a
weight
and
he
then
looked
up
again
moistening
his
lips
was
going
on
with
the
little
i
had
left
to
say
i
knew
all
this
about
mr
eugene
wrayburn
all
the
while
you
were
drawing
me
to
you
i
strove
against
the
knowledge
but
quite
in
vain
it
made
no
difference
in
me
with
mr
eugene
wrayburn
in
my
mind
i
went
on
with
mr
eugene
wrayburn
in
my
mind
i
spoke
to
you
just
now
with
mr
eugene
wrayburn
in
my
mind
i
have
been
set
aside
and
i
have
been
cast
out
you
give
those
names
to
my
thanking
you
for
your
proposal
and
declining
it
is
it
my
fault
mr
headstone
said
lizzie
compassionating
the
bitter
struggle
he
could
not
conceal
almost
as
much
as
she
was
repelled
and
alarmed
by
it
am
not
complaining
he
returned
am
only
stating
the
case
i
had
to
wrestle
with
my
when
i
submitted
to
be
drawn
to
you
in
spite
of
mr
wrayburn
you
may
imagine
how
low
my
lies
now
she
was
hurt
and
angry
but
repressed
herself
in
consideration
of
his
suffering
and
of
his
being
her
brother
friend
it
lies
under
his
feet
said
bradley
unfolding
his
hands
in
spite
of
himself
and
fiercely
motioning
with
them
both
towards
the
stones
of
the
pavement
that
it
lies
under
that
fellow
feet
and
he
treads
upon
it
and
exults
above
it
does
not
said
lizzie
does
said
bradley
have
stood
before
him
face
to
face
and
he
crushed
me
down
in
the
dirt
of
his
contempt
and
walked
over
me
why
because
he
knew
with
triumph
what
was
in
store
for
me
mr
headstone
you
talk
quite
wildly
collectedly
i
know
what
i
say
too
well
now
i
have
said
all
i
have
used
no
threat
remember
i
have
done
no
more
than
show
you
how
the
case
stands
how
the
case
stands
so
far
at
this
moment
her
brother
sauntered
into
view
close
by
she
darted
to
him
and
caught
him
by
the
hand
bradley
followed
and
laid
his
heavy
hand
on
the
boy
opposite
shoulder
hexam
i
am
going
home
i
must
walk
home
by
myself
and
get
shut
up
in
my
room
without
being
spoken
to
give
me
half
an
hour
start
and
let
me
be
till
you
find
me
at
my
work
in
the
morning
i
shall
be
at
my
work
in
the
morning
just
as
usual
clasping
his
hands
he
uttered
a
short
unearthly
broken
cry
and
went
his
way
the
brother
and
sister
were
left
looking
at
one
another
near
a
lamp
in
the
solitary
churchyard
and
the
boy
face
clouded
and
darkened
as
he
said
in
a
rough
tone
is
the
meaning
of
this
what
have
you
done
to
my
best
friend
out
with
the
truth
said
his
sister
a
little
more
considerately
am
not
in
the
humour
for
consideration
or
for
nonsense
of
any
sort
replied
the
boy
have
you
been
doing
why
has
mr
headstone
gone
from
us
in
that
way
asked
me
you
know
he
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
charley
said
the
boy
impatiently
i
was
obliged
to
tell
him
that
i
could
not
be
his
wife
were
obliged
to
tell
him
repeated
the
boy
angrily
between
his
teeth
and
rudely
pushing
her
away
were
obliged
to
tell
him
do
you
know
that
he
is
worth
fifty
of
you
may
easily
be
so
charley
but
i
can
not
marry
him
mean
that
you
are
conscious
that
you
ca
appreciate
him
and
do
deserve
him
i
suppose
mean
that
i
do
not
like
him
charley
and
that
i
will
never
marry
him
my
soul
exclaimed
the
boy
are
a
nice
picture
of
a
sister
upon
my
soul
you
are
a
pretty
piece
of
disinterestedness
and
so
all
my
endeavours
to
cancel
the
past
and
to
raise
myself
in
the
world
and
to
raise
you
with
me
are
to
be
beaten
down
by
your
low
whims
are
they
will
not
reproach
you
charley
her
exclaimed
the
boy
looking
round
at
the
darkness
reproach
me
she
does
her
best
to
destroy
my
fortunes
and
her
own
and
she
wo
reproach
me
why
you
tell
me
next
that
you
reproach
mr
headstone
for
coming
out
of
the
sphere
to
which
he
is
an
ornament
and
putting
himself
at
your
feet
to
be
rejected
by
you
charley
i
will
only
tell
you
as
i
told
himself
that
i
thank
him
for
doing
so
that
i
am
sorry
he
did
so
and
that
i
hope
he
will
do
much
better
and
be
happy
some
touch
of
compunction
smote
the
boy
hardening
heart
as
he
looked
upon
her
his
patient
little
nurse
in
infancy
his
patient
friend
adviser
and
reclaimer
in
boyhood
the
sister
who
had
done
everything
for
him
his
tone
relented
and
he
drew
her
arm
through
his
come
liz
do
let
us
quarrel
let
us
be
reasonable
and
talk
this
over
like
brother
and
sister
will
you
listen
to
me
charley
she
replied
through
her
starting
tears
i
not
listen
to
you
and
hear
many
hard
things
i
am
sorry
there
liz
i
am
unfeignedly
sorry
only
you
do
put
me
out
so
now
see
mr
headstone
is
perfectly
devoted
to
you
he
has
told
me
in
the
strongest
manner
that
he
has
never
been
his
old
self
for
one
single
minute
since
i
first
brought
him
to
see
you
miss
peecher
our
schoolmistress
pretty
and
young
and
all
that
is
known
to
be
very
much
attached
to
him
and
he
wo
so
much
as
look
at
her
or
hear
of
her
now
his
devotion
to
you
must
be
a
disinterested
one
must
it
if
he
married
miss
peecher
he
would
be
a
great
deal
better
off
in
all
worldly
respects
than
in
marrying
you
well
then
he
has
nothing
to
get
by
it
has
he
heaven
knows
well
then
said
the
boy
something
in
his
favour
and
a
great
thing
then
i
come
in
mr
headstone
has
always
got
me
on
and
he
has
a
good
deal
in
his
power
and
of
course
if
he
was
my
he
would
get
me
on
less
but
would
get
me
on
more
mr
headstone
comes
and
confides
in
me
in
a
very
delicate
way
and
says
i
hope
my
marrying
your
sister
would
be
agreeable
to
you
hexam
and
useful
to
you
i
say
there
nothing
in
the
world
mr
headstone
that
i
could
be
better
pleased
mr
headstone
says
then
i
may
rely
upon
your
intimate
knowledge
of
me
for
your
good
word
with
your
sister
hexam
and
i
say
certainly
mr
headstone
and
naturally
i
have
a
good
deal
of
influence
with
so
i
have
have
i
liz
charley
said
now
you
see
we
begin
to
get
on
the
moment
we
begin
to
be
really
talking
it
over
like
brother
and
sister
very
well
then
you
come
in
as
mr
headstone
wife
you
would
be
occupying
a
most
respectable
station
and
you
would
be
holding
a
far
better
place
in
society
than
you
hold
now
and
you
would
at
length
get
quit
of
the
and
the
old
disagreeables
belonging
to
it
and
you
would
be
rid
for
good
of
dolls
dressmakers
and
their
drunken
fathers
and
the
like
of
that
not
that
i
want
to
disparage
miss
jenny
wren
i
dare
say
she
is
all
very
well
in
her
way
but
her
way
is
not
your
way
as
mr
headstone
wife
now
you
see
liz
on
all
three
accounts
on
mr
headstone
on
mine
on
yours
nothing
could
be
better
or
more
desirable
they
were
walking
slowly
as
the
boy
spoke
and
here
he
stood
still
to
see
what
effect
he
had
made
his
sister
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
but
as
they
showed
no
yielding
and
as
she
remained
silent
he
walked
her
on
again
there
was
some
discomfiture
in
his
tone
as
he
resumed
though
he
tried
to
conceal
it
so
much
influence
with
you
liz
as
i
have
perhaps
i
should
have
done
better
to
have
had
a
little
chat
with
you
in
the
first
instance
before
mr
headstone
spoke
for
himself
but
really
all
this
in
his
favour
seemed
so
plain
and
undeniable
and
i
knew
you
to
have
always
been
so
reasonable
and
sensible
that
i
did
consider
it
worth
while
very
likely
that
was
a
mistake
of
mine
however
it
soon
set
right
all
that
need
be
done
to
set
it
right
is
for
you
to
tell
me
at
once
that
i
may
go
home
and
tell
mr
headstone
that
what
has
taken
place
is
not
final
and
that
it
will
all
come
round
he
stopped
again
the
pale
face
looked
anxiously
and
lovingly
at
him
but
she
shook
her
head
you
speak
said
the
boy
sharply
am
very
unwilling
to
speak
charley
if
i
must
i
must
i
can
not
authorize
you
to
say
any
such
thing
to
mr
headstone
i
can
not
allow
you
to
say
any
such
thing
to
mr
headstone
nothing
remains
to
be
said
to
him
from
me
after
what
i
have
said
for
good
and
all
this
girl
cried
the
boy
contemptuously
throwing
her
off
again
herself
a
sister
dear
that
is
the
second
time
that
you
have
almost
struck
me
do
be
hurt
by
my
words
i
do
mean
heaven
forbid
that
you
intended
it
but
you
hardly
know
with
what
a
sudden
swing
you
removed
yourself
from
me
said
the
boy
taking
no
heed
of
the
remonstrance
and
pursuing
his
own
mortified
disappointment
know
what
this
means
and
you
shall
not
disgrace
me
means
what
i
have
told
you
charley
and
nothing
more
not
true
said
the
boy
in
a
violent
tone
you
know
not
it
means
your
precious
mr
wrayburn
that
what
it
means
if
you
remember
any
old
days
of
ours
together
forbear
you
shall
not
disgrace
me
doggedly
pursued
the
boy
am
determined
that
after
i
have
climbed
up
out
of
the
mire
you
shall
not
pull
me
down
you
ca
disgrace
me
if
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
and
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
for
the
future
on
many
a
night
like
this
and
many
a
worse
night
i
have
sat
on
the
stones
of
the
street
hushing
you
in
my
arms
unsay
those
words
without
even
saying
you
are
sorry
for
them
and
my
arms
are
open
to
you
still
and
so
is
my
heart
not
unsay
them
i
say
them
again
you
are
an
inveterately
bad
girl
and
a
false
sister
and
i
have
done
with
you
for
ever
i
have
done
with
you
he
threw
up
his
ungrateful
and
ungracious
hand
as
if
it
set
up
a
barrier
between
them
and
flung
himself
upon
his
heel
and
left
her
she
remained
impassive
on
the
same
spot
silent
and
motionless
until
the
striking
of
the
church
clock
roused
her
and
she
turned
away
but
then
with
the
breaking
up
of
her
immobility
came
the
breaking
up
of
the
waters
that
the
cold
heart
of
the
selfish
boy
had
frozen
and
that
i
were
lying
here
with
the
dead
and
charley
charley
that
this
should
be
the
end
of
our
pictures
in
the
fire
were
all
the
words
she
said
as
she
laid
her
face
in
her
hands
on
the
stone
coping
a
figure
passed
by
and
passed
on
but
stopped
and
looked
round
at
her
it
was
the
figure
of
an
old
man
with
a
bowed
head
wearing
a
large
brimmed
hat
and
a
coat
after
hesitating
a
little
the
figure
turned
back
and
advancing
with
an
air
of
gentleness
and
compassion
said
me
young
woman
for
speaking
to
you
but
you
are
under
some
distress
of
mind
i
can
not
pass
upon
my
way
and
leave
you
weeping
here
alone
as
if
there
was
nothing
in
the
place
can
i
help
you
can
i
do
anything
to
give
you
comfort
she
raised
her
head
at
the
sound
of
these
kind
words
and
answered
gladly
mr
riah
is
it

said
the
old
man
stand
amazed
i
spoke
as
to
a
stranger

arm

daughter
come
home
with
me
it
is
but
across
the
road
and
take
a
little
time
to
recover
your
peace
and
to
make
your
eyes
seemly
and
then
i
will
bear
you
company
through
the
streets
for
it
is
past
your
usual
time
and
will
soon
be
late
and
the
way
is
long
and
there
is
much
company
out
of
doors
she
accepted
the
support
he
offered
her
and
they
slowly
passed
out
of
the
churchyard
they
were
in
the
act
of
emerging
into
the
main
thoroughfare
when
another
figure
loitering
discontentedly
by
and
looking
up
the
street
and
down
it
and
all
about
started
and
exclaimed
why
where
have
you
been
why
what
the
matter
as
eugene
wrayburn
thus
addressed
her
she
drew
closer
to
the
jew
and
bent
her
head
the
jew
having
taken
in
the
whole
of
eugene
at
one
sharp
glance
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
and
stood
mute
what
is
the
matter
wrayburn
i
can
not
tell
you
now
i
can
not
tell
you
if
i
ever
can
tell
you

lizzie
i
came
expressly
to
join
you
i
came
to
walk
home
with
you
having
dined
at
a
in
this
neighbourhood
and
knowing
your
hour
and
i
have
been
lingering
about

eugene
a
bailiff
or
with
a
look
at
riah
old
clothesman
the
jew
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
took
in
eugene
once
more
at
another
glance
wrayburn
pray

me
with
this
protector
and
one
thing
more

careful
of

of
udolpho
said
eugene
with
a
look
of
wonder
i
be
excused
for
asking
in
the
elderly
gentleman
presence
who
is
this
kind
protector
trustworthy
friend
said
lizzie

relieve
him
of
his
trust
returned
eugene
you
must
tell
me
lizzie
what

the
matter

the
matter
said
the
old
man
lifting
up
his
eyes
again
brother
the
matter
returned
eugene
with
airy
contempt
brother
is
not
worth
a
thought
far
less
a
tear
what
has
our
brother
done
the
old
man
lifted
up
his
eyes
again
with
one
grave
look
at
wrayburn
and
one
grave
glance
at
lizzie
as
she
stood
looking
down
both
were
so
full
of
meaning
that
even
eugene
was
checked
in
his
light
career
and
subsided
into
a
thoughtful
with
an
air
of
perfect
patience
the
old
man
remaining
mute
and
keeping
his
eyes
cast
down
stood
retaining
lizzie
arm
as
though
in
his
habit
of
passive
endurance
it
would
be
all
one
to
him
if
he
had
stood
there
motionless
all
night
mr
aaron
said
eugene
who
soon
found
this
fatiguing
be
good
enough
to
relinquish
his
charge
to
me
he
will
be
quite
free
for
any
engagement
he
may
have
at
the
synagogue
mr
aaron
will
you
have
the
kindness
but
the
old
man
stood
stock
still
evening
mr
aaron
said
eugene
politely
need
not
detain
you
then
turning
to
lizzie
our
friend
mr
aaron
a
little
deaf
hearing
is
very
good
christian
gentleman
replied
the
old
man
calmly
i
will
hear
only
one
voice
desiring
me
to
leave
this
damsel
before
i
have
conveyed
her
to
her
home
if
she
requests
it
i
will
do
it
i
will
do
it
for
no
one
else
i
ask
why
so
mr
aaron
said
eugene
quite
undisturbed
in
his
ease
me
if
she
asks
me
i
will
tell
her
replied
the
old
man
will
tell
no
one
else
do
not
ask
you
said
lizzie
i
beg
you
to
take
me
home
mr
wrayburn
i
have
had
a
bitter
trial
and
i
hope
you
will
not
think
me
ungrateful
or
mysterious
or
changeable
i
am
neither
i
am
wretched
pray
remember
what
i
said
to
you
pray
pray
take
care
dear
lizzie
he
returned
in
a
low
voice
bending
over
her
on
the
other
side
what
of
whom
any
one
you
have
lately
seen
and
made
angry
he
snapped
his
fingers
and
laughed
said
he
no
better
may
be
mr
aaron
and
i
will
divide
this
trust
and
see
you
home
together
mr
aaron
on
that
side
i
on
this
if
perfectly
agreeable
to
mr
aaron
the
escort
will
now
proceed
he
knew
his
power
over
her
he
knew
that
she
would
not
insist
upon
his
leaving
her
he
knew
that
her
fears
for
him
being
aroused
she
would
be
uneasy
if
he
were
out
of
her
sight
for
all
his
seeming
levity
and
carelessness
he
knew
whatever
he
chose
to
know
of
the
thoughts
of
her
heart
and
going
on
at
her
side
so
gaily
regardless
of
all
that
had
been
urged
against
him
so
superior
in
his
sallies
and
to
the
gloomy
constraint
of
her
suitor
and
the
selfish
petulance
of
her
brother
so
faithful
to
her
as
it
seemed
when
her
own
stock
was
faithless
what
an
immense
advantage
what
an
overpowering
influence
were
his
that
night
add
to
the
rest
poor
girl
that
she
had
heard
him
vilified
for
her
sake
and
that
she
had
suffered
for
his
and
where
the
wonder
that
his
occasional
tones
of
serious
interest
setting
off
his
carelessness
as
if
it
were
assumed
to
calm
her
that
his
lightest
touch
his
lightest
look
his
very
presence
beside
her
in
the
dark
common
street
were
like
glimpses
of
an
enchanted
world
which
it
was
natural
for
jealousy
and
malice
and
all
meanness
to
be
unable
to
bear
the
brightness
of
and
to
gird
at
as
bad
spirits
might
nothing
more
being
said
of
repairing
to
riah
they
went
direct
to
lizzie
lodging
a
little
short
of
the
she
parted
from
them
and
went
in
alone
aaron
said
eugene
when
they
were
left
together
in
the
street
many
thanks
for
your
company
it
remains
for
me
unwillingly
to
say
farewell
returned
the
other
give
you
good
night
and
i
wish
that
you
were
not
so
thoughtless
aaron
returned
eugene
give
you
good
night
and
i
wish
for
you
are
a
little
dull
that
you
were
not
so
thoughtful
but
now
that
his
part
was
played
out
for
the
evening
and
when
in
turning
his
back
upon
the
jew
he
came
off
the
stage
he
was
thoughtful
himself
did
lightwood
catechism
run
he
murmured
as
he
stopped
to
light
his
cigar
is
to
come
of
it
what
are
you
doing
where
are
you
going
we
shall
soon
know
now
ah
with
a
heavy
sigh
the
heavy
sigh
was
repeated
as
if
by
an
echo
an
hour
afterwards
when
riah
who
had
been
sitting
on
some
dark
steps
in
a
corner
over
against
the
house
arose
and
went
his
patient
way
stealing
through
the
streets
in
his
ancient
dress
like
the
ghost
of
a
departed
time
chapter
an
anniversary
occasion
the
estimable
twemlow
dressing
himself
in
his
lodgings
over
the
in
duke
street
saint
james
and
hearing
the
horses
at
their
toilette
below
finds
himself
on
the
whole
in
a
disadvantageous
position
as
compared
with
the
noble
animals
at
livery
for
whereas
on
the
one
hand
he
has
no
attendant
to
slap
him
soundingly
and
require
him
in
gruff
accents
to
come
up
and
come
over
still
on
the
other
hand
he
has
no
attendant
at
all
and
the
mild
gentleman
and
other
joints
working
rustily
in
the
morning
he
could
deem
it
agreeable
even
to
be
tied
up
by
the
countenance
at
his
so
he
were
there
skilfully
rubbed
down
and
slushed
and
sluiced
and
polished
and
clothed
while
himself
taking
merely
a
passive
part
in
these
trying
transactions
how
the
fascinating
tippins
gets
on
when
arraying
herself
for
the
bewilderment
of
the
senses
of
men
is
known
only
to
the
graces
and
her
maid
but
perhaps
even
that
engaging
creature
though
not
reduced
to
the
of
twemlow
could
dispense
with
a
good
deal
of
the
trouble
attendant
on
the
daily
restoration
of
her
charms
seeing
that
as
to
her
face
and
neck
this
adorable
divinity
is
as
it
were
a
diurnal
species
of
lobster
throwing
off
a
shell
every
forenoon
and
needing
to
keep
in
a
retired
spot
until
the
new
crust
hardens
howbeit
twemlow
doth
at
length
invest
himself
with
collar
and
cravat
and
wristbands
to
his
knuckles
and
goeth
forth
to
breakfast
and
to
breakfast
with
whom
but
his
near
neighbours
the
lammles
of
sackville
street
who
have
imparted
to
him
that
he
will
meet
his
distant
kinsman
mr
fledgely
the
awful
snigsworth
might
taboo
and
prohibit
fledgely
but
the
peaceable
twemlow
reasons
if
he
is
my
kinsman
i
did
make
him
so
and
to
meet
a
man
is
not
to
know
him
it
is
the
first
anniversary
of
the
happy
marriage
of
mr
and
mrs
lammle
and
the
celebration
is
a
breakfast
because
a
dinner
on
the
desired
scale
of
sumptuosity
can
not
be
achieved
within
less
limits
than
those
of
the
palatial
residence
of
which
so
many
people
are
madly
envious
so
twemlow
trips
with
not
a
little
stiffness
across
piccadilly
sensible
of
having
once
been
more
upright
in
figure
and
less
in
danger
of
being
knocked
down
by
swift
vehicles
to
be
sure
that
was
in
the
days
when
he
hoped
for
leave
from
the
dread
snigsworth
to
do
something
or
be
something
in
life
and
before
that
magnificent
tartar
issued
the
ukase
he
will
never
distinguish
himself
he
must
be
a
poor
of
mine
and
let
him
hereby
consider
himself
pensioned
ah
my
twemlow
say
little
feeble
grey
personage
what
thoughts
are
in
thy
breast
of
the
fancy
so
still
to
call
her
who
bruised
thy
heart
when
it
was
green
and
thy
head
brown
and
whether
it
be
better
or
worse
more
painful
or
less
to
believe
in
the
fancy
to
this
hour
than
to
know
her
for
a
greedy
crocodile
with
no
more
capacity
of
imagining
the
delicate
and
sensitive
and
tender
spot
behind
thy
waistcoat
than
of
going
straight
at
it
with
a
say
likewise
my
twemlow
whether
it
be
the
happier
lot
to
be
a
poor
relation
of
the
great
or
to
stand
in
the
wintry
slush
giving
the
hack
horses
to
drink
out
of
the
shallow
tub
at
the
into
which
thou
has
so
nearly
set
thy
uncertain
foot
twemlow
says
nothing
and
goes
on
as
he
approaches
the
lammles
door
drives
up
a
little
carriage
containing
tippins
the
divine
tippins
letting
down
the
window
playfully
extols
the
vigilance
of
her
cavalier
in
being
in
waiting
there
to
hand
her
out
twemlow
hands
her
out
with
as
much
polite
gravity
as
if
she
were
anything
real
and
they
proceed
upstairs
tippins
all
abroad
about
the
legs
and
seeking
to
express
that
those
unsteady
articles
are
only
skipping
in
their
native
buoyancy
and
dear
mrs
lammle
and
dear
mr
lammle

out
from
my
list
of

of
fickleness
and
then
of
base
desertion
how
do
you
do
wretch

mr

here
what
can
you
come
for
because
we

very
sure

not
going
to
talk
and
veneering
how
are
things
going
on
down
at
the
house
and
when
will
you
turn
out
those
terrible
people
for
us
and
mrs
veneering
my
dear
can
it
positively
be
true
that
you
go
down
to
that
stifling
place
night
after
night
to
hear
those
men
prose
talking
of
which
veneering
why
you

for
you

opened
your

no

oh
mr

delighted
mr

this
is
a
gathering
of
the
clans
thus
tippins
and
surveys
fledgeby
and
outsiders
through
golden
glass
murmuring
as
she
turns
about

about

innocent
giddy
way
anybody

i

not
nobody
there

mr

all
produces
his

as
dying
for
the
honour
of

fledgeby

the

nothing

air
successively
of
meditation
of
resignation
and
of
desolation
backs
on
brewer
makes
the
tour
of
boots
and
fades
into
the
extreme
background
feeling
for
his
whisker
as
if
it
might
have
turned
up
since
he
was
there
five
minutes
ago
but
lammle
has
him
out
again
before
he
has
so
much
as
completely
ascertained
the
bareness
of
the
land
he
would
seem
to
be
in
a
bad
way
fledgeby
for
lammle
represents
him
as
dying
again
he
is
dying
now
of
want
of
presentation
to
twemlow
twemlow
offers
his
hand
glad
to
see
him
mother
sir
was
a
connexion
of
mine

so
says
fledgeby
my
mother
and
her
family
were
two
you
staying
in
town
asks
twemlow
always
am
says
fledgeby
like
town
says
twemlow
but
is
felled
flat
by
fledgeby
taking
it
quite
ill
and
replying
no
he
do
like
town
lammle
tries
to
break
the
force
of
the
fall
by
remarking
that
some
people
do
not
like
town
fledgeby
retorting
that
he
never
heard
of
any
such
case
but
his
own
twemlow
goes
down
again
heavily
is
nothing
new
this
morning
i
suppose
says
twemlow
returning
to
the
mark
with
great
spirit
fledgeby
has
not
heard
of
anything
there
not
a
word
of
news
says
lammle
a
particle
adds
boots
an
atom
chimes
in
brewer
somehow
the
execution
of
this
little
concerted
piece
appears
to
raise
the
general
spirits
as
with
a
sense
of
duty
done
and
sets
the
company
a
going
everybody
seems
more
equal
than
before
to
the
calamity
of
being
in
the
society
of
everybody
else
even
eugene
standing
in
a
window
moodily
swinging
the
tassel
of
a
blind
gives
it
a
smarter
jerk
now
as
if
he
found
himself
in
better
case
breakfast
announced
everything
on
table
showy
and
gaudy
but
with
a
temporary
and
nomadic
air
on
the
decorations
as
boasting
that
they
will
be
much
more
showy
and
gaudy
in
the
palatial
residence
mr
lammle
own
particular
servant
behind
his
chair
the
analytical
behind
veneering
chair
instances
in
point
that
such
servants
fall
into
two
classes
one
mistrusting
the
acquaintances
and
the
other
mistrusting
the
master
mr
servant
of
the
second
class
appearing
to
be
lost
in
wonder
and
low
spirits
because
the
police
are
so
long
in
coming
to
take
his
master
up
on
some
charge
of
the
first
magnitude
veneering
on
the
right
of
mrs
lammle
twemlow
on
her
left
mrs
veneering
wife
of
member
of
parliament
and
lady
tippins
on
mr
lammle
right
and
left
but
be
sure
that
well
within
the
fascination
of
mr
lammle
eye
and
smile
sits
little
georgiana
and
be
sure
that
close
to
little
georgiana
also
under
inspection
by
the
same
gingerous
gentleman
sits
fledgeby
oftener
than
twice
or
thrice
while
breakfast
is
in
progress
mr
twemlow
gives
a
little
sudden
turn
towards
mrs
lammle
and
then
says
to
her
beg
your
pardon
this
not
being
twemlow
usual
way
why
is
it
his
way
why
the
truth
is
twemlow
repeatedly
labours
under
the
impression
that
mrs
lammle
is
going
to
speak
to
him
and
turning
finds
that
it
is
not
so
and
mostly
that
she
has
her
eyes
upon
veneering
strange
that
this
impression
so
abides
by
twemlow
after
being
corrected
yet
so
it
is
lady
tippins
partaking
plentifully
of
the
fruits
of
the
earth
including
in
the
category
becomes
livelier
and
applies
herself
to
elicit
sparks
from
mortimer
lightwood
it
is
always
understood
among
the
initiated
that
that
faithless
lover
must
be
planted
at
table
opposite
to
lady
tippins
who
will
then
strike
conversational
fire
out
of
him
in
a
pause
of
mastication
and
deglutition
lady
tippins
contemplating
mortimer
recalls
that
it
was
at
our
dear
veneerings
and
in
the
presence
of
a
party
who
are
surely
all
here
that
he
told
them
his
story
of
the
man
from
somewhere
which
afterwards
became
so
horribly
interesting
and
vulgarly
popular
lady
tippins
assents
mortimer
they
say
on
the
stage
even
so
we
expect
you
retorts
the
charmer
sustain
your
reputation
and
tell
us
something
else
tippins
i
exhausted
myself
for
life
that
day
and
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
got
out
of
me
mortimer
parries
thus
with
a
sense
upon
him
that
elsewhere
it
is
eugene
and
not
he
who
is
the
jester
and
that
in
these
circles
where
eugene
persists
in
being
speechless
he
mortimer
is
but
the
double
of
the
friend
on
whom
he
has
founded
himself
quoth
the
fascinating
tippins
am
resolved
on
getting
something
more
out
of
you
traitor
what
is
this
i
hear
about
another
disappearance
it
is
you
who
have
heard
it
returns
lightwood
tell
us
away
retorts
lady
tippins
own
golden
dustman
referred
me
to
you
mr
lammle
striking
in
here
proclaims
aloud
that
there
is
a
sequel
to
the
story
of
the
man
from
somewhere
silence
ensues
upon
the
proclamation
assure
you
says
lightwood
glancing
round
the
table
have
nothing
to
tell
but
eugene
adding
in
a
low
voice
tell
it
tell
it
he
corrects
himself
with
the
addition
worth
mentioning
boots
and
brewer
immediately
perceive
that
it
is
immensely
worth
mentioning
and
become
politely
clamorous
veneering
is
also
visited
by
a
perception
to
the
same
effect
but
it
is
understood
that
his
attention
is
now
rather
used
up
and
difficult
to
hold
that
being
the
tone
of
the
house
of
commons
do
be
at
the
trouble
of
composing
yourselves
to
listen
says
mortimer
lightwood
i
shall
have
finished
long
before
you
have
fallen
into
comfortable
attitudes
it
like
like
impatiently
interrupts
eugene
children
narrative
i
tell
you
a
story
of
jack
a
manory
and
now
my
story
begun
i
tell
you
another
of
jack
and
his
brother
and
now
my
story
is
get
on
and
get
it
over
eugene
says
this
with
a
sound
of
vexation
in
his
voice
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
looking
balefully
at
lady
tippins
who
nods
to
him

mortimer
i
suppose
to
be
made
by
my
honourable
and
fair
enslaver
opposite
is
to
the
following
circumstance
very
lately
the
young
woman
lizzie
hexam
daughter
of
the
late
jesse
hexam
otherwise
gaffer
who
will
be
remembered
to
have
found
the
body
of
the
man
from
somewhere
mysteriously
received
she
knew
not
from
whom
an
explicit
retraction
of
the
charges
made
against
her
father
by
another
character
of
the
name
of
riderhood
nobody
believed
them
because
little
rogue
riderhood
i
am
tempted
into
the
paraphrase
by
remembering
the
charming
wolf
who
would
have
rendered
society
a
great
service
if
he
had
devoured
mr
riderhood
father
and
mother
in
their
infancy
had
previously
played
fast
and
loose
with
the
said
charges
and
in
fact
abandoned
them
however
the
retraction
i
have
mentioned
found
its
way
into
lizzie
hexam
hands
with
a
general
flavour
on
it
of
having
been
favoured
by
some
anonymous
messenger
in
a
dark
cloak
and
slouched
hat
and
was
by
her
forwarded
in
her
father
vindication
to
mr
boffin
my
client
you
will
excuse
the
phraseology
of
the
shop
but
as
i
never
had
another
client
and
in
all
likelihood
never
shall
have
i
am
rather
proud
of
him
as
a
natural
curiosity
probably
unique
although
as
easy
as
usual
on
the
surface
lightwood
is
not
quite
as
easy
as
usual
below
it
with
an
air
of
not
minding
eugene
at
all
he
feels
that
the
subject
is
not
altogether
a
safe
one
in
that
connexion
natural
curiosity
which
forms
the
sole
ornament
of
my
professional
museum
he
resumes
desires
his
secretary
an
individual
of
the
or
oyster
species
and
whose
name
i
think
is
chokesmith
but
it
does
in
the
least
matter
say
artichoke
to
put
himself
in
communication
with
lizzie
hexam
artichoke
professes
his
readiness
so
to
do
endeavours
to
do
so
but
fails
fails

postpone
the

for
one

or
we

my

refers
the
task
to
me
his
purpose
being
to
advance
the
interests
of
the
object
of
his
search
i
proceed
to
put
myself
in

with
her
i
even

to
possess
some
special

with
a
glance
at
eugene
putting

in

the
general
echo

mortimer
knows
how
nobody

nobody

where
and
so
ends
the
story
to
which
my
honourable
and
fair
enslaver
opposite
referred
tippins
with
a
bewitching
little
scream
opines
that
we
shall
every
one
of
us
be
murdered
in
our
beds
eugene
eyes
her
as
if
some
of
us
would
be

for
him
mrs
veneering
remarks
that
these
social
mysteries
make
one
afraid
of
leaving
baby
veneering
wishes
to
be
informed
with
something
of
a
air
of
seeing
the
right
honourable
gentleman
at
the
head
of
the
home
department
in
his
place
whether
it
is
intended
to
be
conveyed
that
the
vanished
person
has
been
spirited
away
or
otherwise
harmed
instead
of
lightwood
answering
eugene
answers
and
answers
hastily
and
vexedly
no
no
he
mean
that
he
means
voluntarily
vanished
but
utterly
completely
however
the
great
subject
of
the
happiness
of
mr
and
mrs
lammle
must
not
be
allowed
to
vanish
with
the
other
vanishments
with
the
vanishing
of
the
murderer
the
vanishing
of
julius
handford
the
vanishing
of
lizzie
hexam
and
therefore
veneering
must
recall
the
present
sheep
to
the
pen
from
which
they
have
strayed
who
so
fit
to
discourse
of
the
happiness
of
mr
and
mrs
lammle
they
being
the
dearest
and
oldest
friends
he
has
in
the
world
or
what
audience
so
fit
for
him
to
take
into
his
confidence
as
that
audience
a
noun
of
multitude
or
signifying
many
who
are
all
the
oldest
and
dearest
friends
he
has
in
the
world
so
veneering
without
the
formality
of
rising
launches
into
a
familiar
oration
gradually
toning
into
the
parliamentary
in
which
he
sees
at
that
board
his
dear
friend
twemlow
who
on
that
day
twelvemonth
bestowed
on
his
dear
friend
lammle
the
fair
hand
of
his
dear
friend
sophronia
and
in
which
he
also
sees
at
that
board
his
dear
friends
boots
and
brewer
whose
rallying
round
him
at
a
period
when
his
dear
friend
lady
tippins
likewise
rallied
round
him
ay
and
in
the
foremost
rank
he
can
never
forget
while
memory
holds
her
seat
but
he
is
free
to
confess
that
he
misses
from
that
board
his
dear
old
friend
podsnap
though
he
is
well
represented
by
his
dear
young
friend
georgiana
and
he
further
sees
at
that
board
this
he
announces
with
pomp
as
if
exulting
in
the
powers
of
an
extraordinary
telescope
his
friend
mr
fledgeby
if
he
will
permit
him
to
call
him
so
for
all
of
these
reasons
and
many
more
which
he
right
well
knows
will
have
occurred
to
persons
of
your
exceptional
acuteness
he
is
here
to
submit
to
you
that
the
time
has
arrived
when
with
our
hearts
in
our
glasses
with
tears
in
our
eyes
with
blessings
on
our
lips
and
in
a
general
way
with
a
profusion
of
gammon
and
spinach
in
our
emotional
larders
we
should
one
and
all
drink
to
our
dear
friends
the
lammles
wishing
them
many
years
as
happy
as
the
last
and
many
many
friends
as
congenially
united
as
themselves
and
this
he
will
add
that
anastatia
veneering
who
is
instantly
heard
to
weep
is
formed
on
the
same
model
as
her
old
and
chosen
friend
sophronia
lammle
in
respect
that
she
is
devoted
to
the
man
who
wooed
and
won
her
and
nobly
discharges
the
duties
of
a
wife
seeing
no
better
way
out
of
it
veneering
here
pulls
up
his
oratorical
pegasus
extremely
short
and
plumps
down
clean
over
his
head
with
god
bless
you
then
lammle
too
much
of
him
every
way
pervadingly
too
much
nose
of
a
coarse
wrong
shape
and
his
nose
in
his
mind
and
his
manners
too
much
smile
to
be
real
too
much
frown
to
be
false
too
many
large
teeth
to
be
visible
at
once
without
suggesting
a
bite
he
thanks
you
dear
friends
for
your
kindly
greeting
and
hopes
to
receive
you
it
may
be
on
the
next
of
these
delightful
occasions
in
a
residence
better
suited
to
your
claims
on
the
rites
of
hospitality
he
will
never
forget
that
at
veneering
he
first
saw
sophronia
sophronia
will
never
forget
that
at
veneering
she
first
saw
him
spoke
of
it
soon
after
they
were
married
and
agreed
that
they
would
never
forget
it
in
fact
to
veneering
they
owe
their
union
they
hope
to
show
their
sense
of
this
some
day
no
from
veneering
oh
yes
yes
and
let
him
rely
upon
it
they
will
if
they
can
his
marriage
with
sophronia
was
not
a
marriage
of
interest
on
either
side
she
had
her
little
fortune
he
had
his
little
fortune
they
joined
their
little
fortunes
it
was
a
marriage
of
pure
inclination
and
suitability
thank
you
sophronia
and
he
are
fond
of
the
society
of
young
people
but
he
is
not
sure
that
their
house
would
be
a
good
house
for
young
people
proposing
to
remain
single
since
the
contemplation
of
its
domestic
bliss
might
induce
them
to
change
their
minds
he
will
not
apply
this
to
any
one
present
certainly
not
to
their
darling
little
georgiana
again
thank
you
neither
will
he
apply
it
to
his
friend
fledgeby
he
thanks
veneering
for
the
feeling
manner
in
which
he
referred
to
their
common
friend
fledgeby
for
he
holds
that
gentleman
in
the
highest
estimation
thank
you
in
fact
returning
unexpectedly
to
fledgeby
the
better
you
know
him
the
more
you
find
in
him
that
you
desire
to
know
again
thank
you
in
his
dear
sophronia
name
and
in
his
own
thank
you
mrs
lammle
has
sat
quite
still
with
her
eyes
cast
down
upon
the
as
mr
lammle
address
ends
twemlow
once
more
turns
to
her
involuntarily
not
cured
yet
of
that
often
recurring
impression
that
she
is
going
to
speak
to
him
this
time
she
really
is
going
to
speak
to
him
veneering
is
talking
with
his
other
next
neighbour
and
she
speaks
in
a
low
voice
twemlow
he
answers
beg
your
pardon
yes
still
a
little
doubtful
because
of
her
not
looking
at
him
have
the
soul
of
a
gentleman
and
i
know
i
may
trust
you
will
you
give
me
the
opportunity
of
saying
a
few
words
to
you
when
you
come
up
stairs
i
shall
be
honoured
seem
to
do
so
if
you
please
and
do
think
it
inconsistent
if
my
manner
should
be
more
careless
than
my
words
i
may
be
watched
intensely
astonished
twemlow
puts
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
sinks
back
in
his
chair
meditating
mrs
lammle
rises
all
rise
the
ladies
go
up
stairs
the
gentlemen
soon
saunter
after
them
fledgeby
has
devoted
the
interval
to
taking
an
observation
of
boots
whiskers
whiskers
and
lammle
whiskers
and
considering
which
pattern
of
whisker
he
would
prefer
to
produce
out
of
himself
by
friction
if
the
genie
of
the
cheek
would
only
answer
to
his
rubbing
in
the
groups
form
as
usual
lightwood
boots
and
brewer
flutter
like
moths
around
that
yellow
wax
candle
guttering
down
and
with
some
hint
of
a
in
it
lady
tippins
outsiders
cultivate
veneering
m
and
mrs
veneering
lammle
stands
with
folded
arms
mephistophelean
in
a
corner
with
georgiana
and
fledgeby
mrs
lammle
on
a
sofa
by
a
table
invites
mr
twemlow
attention
to
a
book
of
portraits
in
her
hand
mr
twemlow
takes
his
station
on
a
settee
before
her
and
mrs
lammle
shows
him
a
portrait
have
reason
to
be
surprised
she
says
softly
i
wish
you
would
look
so
disturbed
twemlow
making
an
effort
not
to
look
so
looks
much
more
so
think
mr
twemlow
you
never
saw
that
distant
connexion
of
yours
before
never
that
you
do
see
him
you
see
what
he
is
you
are
not
proud
of
him
say
the
truth
mrs
lammle
no
you
knew
more
of
him
you
would
be
less
inclined
to
acknowledge
him
here
is
another
portrait
what
do
you
think
of
it
twemlow
has
just
presence
of
mind
enough
to
say
aloud
like
uncommonly
like
have
noticed
perhaps
whom
he
favours
with
his
attentions
you
notice
where
he
is
now
and
how
engaged
but
mr
lammle
she
darts
a
look
at
him
which
he
can
not
comprehend
and
shows
him
another
portrait
good
is
it
not
says
twemlow
like
as
to
be
almost
a
caricature
mr
twemlow
it
is
impossible
to
tell
you
what
the
struggle
in
my
mind
has
been
before
i
could
bring
myself
to
speak
to
you
as
i
do
now
it
is
only
in
the
conviction
that
i
may
trust
you
never
to
betray
me
that
i
can
proceed
sincerely
promise
me
that
you
never
will
betray
my
confidence
that
you
will
respect
it
even
though
you
may
no
longer
respect
me
and
i
shall
be
as
satisfied
as
if
you
had
sworn
it
on
the
honour
of
a
poor
gentleman
you
i
can
desire
no
more
mr
twemlow
i
implore
you
to
save
that
child
child
she
will
be
sacrificed
she
will
be
inveigled
and
married
to
that
connexion
of
yours
it
is
a
partnership
affair
a
she
has
no
strength
of
will
or
character
to
help
herself
and
she
is
on
the
brink
of
being
sold
into
wretchedness
for
life
but
what
can
i
do
to
prevent
it
demands
twemlow
shocked
and
bewildered
to
the
last
degree
is
another
portrait
and
not
good
is
it
aghast
at
the
light
manner
of
her
throwing
her
head
back
to
look
at
it
critically
twemlow
still
dimly
perceives
the
expediency
of
throwing
his
own
head
back
and
does
so
though
he
no
more
sees
the
portrait
than
if
it
were
in
china
not
good
says
mrs
lammle
and
exaggerated
ex
but
twemlow
in
his
demolished
state
can
not
command
the
word
and
trails
off
into
actly
so
twemlow
your
word
will
have
weight
with
her
pompous
father
you
know
how
much
he
makes
of
your
family
lose
no
time
warn
him
warn
him
against
whom
me
by
great
good
fortune
twemlow
receives
a
stimulant
at
this
critical
instant
the
stimulant
is
lammle
voice
my
dear
what
portraits
are
you
showing
twemlow
characters
alfred
him
the
last
of
me
alfred
she
puts
the
book
down
takes
another
book
up
turns
the
leaves
and
presents
the
portrait
to
twemlow
is
the
last
of
mr
lammle
do
you
think
it
good
warn
her
father
against
me
i
deserve
it
for
i
have
been
in
the
scheme
from
the
first
it
is
my
husband
scheme
your
connexion
and
mine
i
tell
you
this
only
to
show
you
the
necessity
of
the
poor
little
foolish
affectionate
creature
being
befriended
and
rescued
you
will
not
repeat
this
to
her
father
you
will
spare
me
so
far
and
spare
my
husband
for
though
this
celebration
of
is
all
a
mockery
he
is
my
husband
and
we
must
do
you
think
it
like
twemlow
in
a
stunned
condition
feigns
to
compare
the
portrait
in
his
hand
with
the
original
looking
towards
him
from
his
mephistophelean
corner
well
indeed
are
at
length
the
words
which
twemlow
with
great
difficulty
extracts
from
himself
am
glad
you
think
so
on
the
whole
i
myself
consider
it
the
best
the
others
are
so
dark
now
here
for
instance
is
another
of
mr
lammle
i
do
understand
i
do
see
my
way
twemlow
stammers
as
he
falters
over
the
book
with
his
glass
at
his
eye
warn
her
father
and
not
tell
him
tell
him
how
much
tell
him
how
little
i
i
am
getting
lost
him
i
am
a
tell
him
i
am
an
artful
and
designing
woman
tell
him
you
are
sure
his
daughter
is
best
out
of
my
house
and
my
company
tell
him
any
such
things
of
me
they
will
all
be
true
you
know
what
a
man
he
is
and
how
easily
you
can
cause
his
vanity
to
take
the
alarm
tell
him
as
much
as
will
give
him
the
alarm
and
make
him
careful
of
her
and
spare
me
the
rest
mr
twemlow
i
feel
my
sudden
degradation
in
your
eyes
familiar
as
i
am
with
my
degradation
in
my
own
eyes
i
keenly
feel
the
change
that
must
have
come
upon
me
in
yours
in
these
last
few
moments
but
i
trust
to
your
good
faith
with
me
as
implicitly
as
when
i
began
if
you
knew
how
often
i
have
tried
to
speak
to
you
you
would
almost
pity
me
i
want
no
new
promise
from
you
on
my
own
account
for
i
am
satisfied
and
i
always
shall
be
satisfied
with
the
promise
you
have
given
me
i
can
venture
to
say
no
more
for
i
see
that
i
am
watched
if
you
would
set
my
mind
at
rest
with
the
assurance
that
you
will
interpose
with
the
father
and
save
this
harmless
girl
close
that
book
before
you
return
it
to
me
and
i
shall
know
what
you
mean
and
deeply
thank
you
in
my
alfred
mr
twemlow
thinks
the
last
one
the
best
and
quite
agrees
with
you
and
me
alfred
advances
the
groups
break
up
lady
tippins
rises
to
go
and
mrs
veneering
follows
her
leader
for
the
moment
mrs
lammle
does
not
turn
to
them
but
remains
looking
at
twemlow
looking
at
alfred
portrait
through
his
eyeglass
the
moment
past
twemlow
drops
his
eyeglass
at
its
ribbon
length
rises
and
closes
the
book
with
an
emphasis
which
makes
that
fragile
nursling
of
the
fairies
tippins
start
then
and
and
charming
occasion
worthy
of
the
golden
age
and
more

chapter
lodgers
in
queer
street
it
was
a
foggy
day
in
london
and
the
fog
was
heavy
and
dark
animate
london
with
smarting
eyes
and
irritated
lungs
was
blinking
wheezing
and
choking
inanimate
london
was
a
sooty
spectre
divided
in
purpose
between
being
visible
and
invisible
and
so
being
wholly
neither
gaslights
flared
in
the
shops
with
a
haggard
and
unblest
air
as
knowing
themselves
to
be
that
had
no
business
abroad
under
the
sun
while
the
sun
itself
when
it
was
for
a
few
moments
dimly
indicated
through
circling
eddies
of
fog
showed
as
if
it
had
gone
out
and
were
collapsing
flat
and
cold
even
in
the
surrounding
country
it
was
a
foggy
day
but
there
the
fog
was
grey
whereas
in
london
it
was
at
about
the
boundary
line
dark
yellow
and
a
little
within
it
brown
and
then
browner
and
then
browner
until
at
the
heart
of
the
city
which
call
saint
mary
axe
it
was
from
any
point
of
the
high
ridge
of
land
northward
it
might
have
been
discerned
that
the
loftiest
buildings
made
an
occasional
struggle
to
get
their
heads
above
the
foggy
sea
and
especially
that
the
great
dome
of
saint
paul
seemed
to
die
hard
but
this
was
not
perceivable
in
the
streets
at
their
feet
where
the
whole
metropolis
was
a
heap
of
vapour
charged
with
muffled
sound
of
wheels
and
enfolding
a
gigantic
catarrh
at
nine
on
such
a
morning
the
place
of
business
of
pubsey
and
was
not
the
liveliest
object
even
in
saint
mary
axe
which
is
not
a
very
lively
spot
with
a
sobbing
gaslight
in
the
window
and
a
burglarious
stream
of
fog
creeping
in
to
strangle
it
through
the
keyhole
of
the
main
door
but
the
light
went
out
and
the
main
door
opened
and
riah
came
forth
with
a
bag
under
his
arm
almost
in
the
act
of
coming
out
at
the
door
riah
went
into
the
fog
and
was
lost
to
the
eyes
of
saint
mary
axe
but
the
eyes
of
this
history
can
follow
him
westward
by
cornhill
cheapside
fleet
street
and
the
strand
to
piccadilly
and
the
albany
thither
he
went
at
his
grave
and
measured
pace
staff
in
hand
skirt
at
heel
and
more
than
one
head
turning
to
look
back
at
his
venerable
figure
already
lost
in
the
mist
supposed
it
to
be
some
ordinary
figure
indistinctly
seen
which
fancy
and
the
fog
had
worked
into
that
passing
likeness
arrived
at
the
house
in
which
his
master
chambers
were
on
the
second
floor
riah
proceeded
up
the
stairs
and
paused
at
fascination
fledgeby
door
making
free
with
neither
bell
nor
knocker
he
struck
upon
the
door
with
the
top
of
his
staff
and
having
listened
sat
down
on
the
threshold
it
was
characteristic
of
his
habitual
submission
that
he
sat
down
on
the
raw
dark
staircase
as
many
of
his
ancestors
had
probably
sat
down
in
dungeons
taking
what
befell
him
as
it
might
befall
after
a
time
when
he
had
grown
so
cold
as
to
be
fain
to
blow
upon
his
fingers
he
arose
and
knocked
with
his
staff
again
and
listened
again
and
again
sat
down
to
wait
thrice
he
repeated
these
actions
before
his
listening
ears
were
greeted
by
the
voice
of
fledgeby
calling
from
his
bed
your
row
i
come
and
open
the
door
directly
but
in
lieu
of
coming
directly
he
fell
into
a
sweet
sleep
for
some
quarter
of
an
hour
more
during
which
added
interval
riah
sat
upon
the
stairs
and
waited
with
perfect
patience
at
length
the
door
stood
open
and
mr
fledgeby
retreating
drapery
plunged
into
bed
again
following
it
at
a
respectful
distance
riah
passed
into
the
where
a
fire
had
been
sometime
lighted
and
was
burning
briskly
what
time
of
night
do
you
mean
to
call
it
inquired
fledgeby
turning
away
beneath
the
clothes
and
presenting
a
comfortable
rampart
of
shoulder
to
the
chilled
figure
of
the
old
man
it
is
full
ten
in
the
morning
deuce
it
is
then
it
must
be
precious
foggy
foggy
sir
raw
then
and
bitter
said
riah
drawing
out
a
handkerchief
and
wiping
the
moisture
from
his
beard
and
long
grey
hair
as
he
stood
on
the
verge
of
the
rug
with
his
eyes
on
the
acceptable
fire
with
a
plunge
of
enjoyment
fledgeby
settled
himself
afresh
snow
or
sleet
or
slush
or
anything
of
that
sort
he
asked
sir
no
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
the
streets
are
pretty
clean
need
brag
about
it
returned
fledgeby
disappointed
in
his
desire
to
heighten
the
contrast
between
his
bed
and
the
streets
you
always
bragging
about
something
got
the
books
there
are
here
sir
right
i
turn
the
general
subject
over
in
my
mind
for
a
minute
or
two
and
while
i
about
it
you
can
empty
your
bag
and
get
ready
for
me
with
another
comfortable
plunge
mr
fledgeby
fell
asleep
again
the
old
man
having
obeyed
his
directions
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
and
folding
his
hands
before
him
gradually
yielded
to
the
influence
of
the
warmth
and
dozed
he
was
roused
by
mr
fledgeby
appearing
erect
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
in
turkish
slippers
turkish
trousers
got
cheap
from
somebody
who
had
cheated
some
other
somebody
out
of
them
and
a
gown
and
cap
to
correspond
in
that
costume
he
would
have
left
nothing
to
be
desired
if
he
had
been
further
fitted
out
with
a
bottomless
chair
a
lantern
and
a
bunch
of
matches
old
cried
fascination
in
his
light
raillery
dodgery
are
you
up
to
next
sitting
there
with
your
eyes
shut
you
ai
asleep
catch
a
weasel
at
it
and
catch
a
jew
sir
i
fear
i
nodded
said
the
old
man
you
returned
fledgeby
with
a
cunning
look
telling
move
with
a
good
many
i
dare
say
but
it
wo
put
me
off
my
guard
not
a
bad
notion
though
if
you
want
to
look
indifferent
in
driving
a
bargain
oh
you
are
a
dodger
the
old
man
shook
his
head
gently
repudiating
the
imputation
and
suppressed
a
sigh
and
moved
to
the
table
at
which
mr
fledgeby
was
now
pouring
out
for
himself
a
cup
of
steaming
and
fragrant
coffee
from
a
pot
that
had
stood
ready
on
the
hob
it
was
an
edifying
spectacle
the
young
man
in
his
easy
chair
taking
his
coffee
and
the
old
man
with
his
grey
head
bent
standing
awaiting
his
pleasure
said
fledgeby
out
your
balance
in
hand
and
prove
by
figures
how
you
make
it
out
that
it
ai
more
first
of
all
light
that
candle
riah
obeyed
and
then
taking
a
bag
from
his
breast
and
referring
to
the
sum
in
the
accounts
for
which
they
made
him
responsible
told
it
out
upon
the
table
fledgeby
told
it
again
with
great
care
and
rang
every
sovereign
suppose
he
said
taking
one
up
to
eye
it
closely
have
been
lightening
any
of
these
but
it
a
trade
of
your
people
you
know
you
understand
what
sweating
a
pound
means
do
you
as
you
do
sir
returned
the
old
man
with
his
hands
under
opposite
cuffs
of
his
loose
sleeves
as
he
stood
at
the
table
deferentially
observant
of
the
master
face
i
take
the
liberty
to
say
something
may
fledgeby
graciously
conceded
you
not
sir
without
intending
it
of
a
surety
without
intending
it
sometimes
mingle
the
character
i
fairly
earn
in
your
employment
with
the
character
which
it
is
your
policy
that
i
should
bear
do
find
it
worth
my
while
to
cut
things
so
fine
as
to
go
into
the
inquiry
fascination
coolly
answered
in
justice
justice
said
fledgeby
in
generosity
and
generosity
said
fledgeby
a
good
connexion
bring
out
your
vouchers
and
do
talk
jerusalem
palaver
the
vouchers
were
produced
and
for
the
next
mr
fledgeby
concentrated
his
sublime
attention
on
them
they
and
the
accounts
were
all
found
correct
and
the
books
and
the
papers
resumed
their
places
in
the
bag
said
fledgeby
that
branch
of
the
business
the
branch
i
like
best
what
queer
bills
are
to
be
bought
and
at
what
prices
you
have
got
your
list
of
what
in
the
market
a
long
list
replied
riah
taking
out
a
and
selecting
from
its
contents
a
folded
paper
which
being
unfolded
became
a
sheet
of
foolscap
covered
with
close
writing
whistled
fledgeby
as
he
took
it
in
his
hand
street
is
full
of
lodgers
just
at
present
these
are
to
be
disposed
of
in
parcels
are
they
parcels
as
set
forth
returned
the
old
man
looking
over
his
master
shoulder
the
lump
the
lump
will
be
one
knows
beforehand
said
fledgeby
you
get
it
at
price
that
the
question
riah
shook
his
head
and
fledgeby
cast
his
small
eyes
down
the
list
they
presently
began
to
twinkle
and
he
no
sooner
became
conscious
of
their
twinkling
than
he
looked
up
over
his
shoulder
at
the
grave
face
above
him
and
moved
to
the
making
a
desk
of
it
he
stood
there
with
his
back
to
the
old
man
warming
his
knees
perusing
the
list
at
his
leisure
and
often
returning
to
some
lines
of
it
as
though
they
were
particularly
interesting
at
those
times
he
glanced
in
the
to
see
what
note
the
old
man
took
of
him
he
took
none
that
could
be
detected
but
aware
of
his
employer
suspicions
stood
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
mr
fledgeby
was
thus
amiably
engaged
when
a
step
was
heard
at
the
outer
door
and
the
door
was
heard
to
open
hastily
that
your
doing
you
pump
of
israel
said
fledgeby
ca
have
shut
it
then
the
step
was
heard
within
and
the
voice
of
mr
alfred
lammle
called
aloud
you
anywhere
here
fledgeby
to
which
fledgeby
after
cautioning
riah
in
a
low
voice
to
take
his
cue
as
it
should
be
given
him
replied
i
am
and
opened
his
bedroom
door
in
said
fledgeby
gentleman
is
only
pubsey
and
of
saint
mary
axe
that
i
am
trying
to
make
terms
for
an
unfortunate
friend
with
in
a
matter
of
some
dishonoured
bills
but
really
pubsey
and
are
so
strict
with
their
debtors
and
so
hard
to
move
that
i
seem
to
be
wasting
my
time
ca
i
make
any
terms
with
you
on
my
friend
part
mr
riah
am
but
the
representative
of
another
sir
returned
the
jew
in
a
low
voice
do
as
i
am
bidden
by
my
principal
it
is
not
my
capital
that
is
invested
in
the
business
it
is
not
my
profit
that
arises
therefrom
ha
laughed
fledgeby
ha
laughed
lammle
of
course
we
know
good
ai
it
lammle
said
fledgeby
unspeakably
amused
by
his
hidden
joke
the
same
always
the
same
said
lammle
pubsey
and
saint
mary
axe
fledgeby
put
in
as
he
wiped
away
the
tears
that
trickled
from
his
eyes
so
rare
was
his
enjoyment
of
his
secret
joke
riah
is
bound
to
observe
the
invariable
forms
for
such
cases
made
and
provided
said
lammle
is
only
the
representative
of
another
cried
fledgeby
as
he
is
told
by
his
principal
not
his
capital
that
invested
in
the
business
oh
that
good
ha
ha
ha
ha
mr
lammle
joined
in
the
laugh
and
looked
knowing
and
the
more
he
did
both
the
more
exquisite
the
secret
joke
became
for
mr
fledgeby
said
that
fascinating
gentleman
wiping
his
eyes
again
we
go
on
in
this
way
we
shall
seem
to
be
almost
making
game
of
mr
riah
or
of
pubsey
and
saint
mary
axe
or
of
somebody
which
is
far
from
our
intention
mr
riah
if
you
would
have
the
kindness
to
step
into
the
next
room
for
a
few
moments
while
i
speak
with
mr
lammle
here
i
should
like
to
try
to
make
terms
with
you
once
again
before
you
go
the
old
man
who
had
never
raised
his
eyes
during
the
whole
transaction
of
mr
fledgeby
joke
silently
bowed
and
passed
out
by
the
door
which
fledgeby
opened
for
him
having
closed
it
on
him
fledgeby
returned
to
lammle
standing
with
his
back
to
the
bedroom
fire
with
one
hand
under
his
and
all
his
whiskers
in
the
other
said
fledgeby
something
wrong
do
you
know
it
demanded
lammle
you
show
it
replied
fledgeby
in
unintentional
rhyme
then
there
is
said
lammle
is
something
wrong
the
whole
thing
wrong
say
remonstrated
fascination
very
slowly
and
sitting
down
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
to
stare
at
his
glowering
friend
with
his
back
to
the
fire
tell
you
fledgeby
repeated
lammle
with
a
sweep
of
his
right
arm
whole
thing
wrong
the
game
up
game
up
demanded
fledgeby
as
slowly
as
before
and
more
sternly
game
our
game
read
that
fledgeby
took
a
note
from
his
extended
hand
and
read
it
aloud
lammle
esquire
sir
allow
mrs
podsnap
and
myself
to
express
our
united
sense
of
the
polite
attentions
of
mrs
alfred
lammle
and
yourself
towards
our
daughter
georgiana
allow
us
also
wholly
to
reject
them
for
the
future
and
to
communicate
our
final
desire
that
the
two
families
may
become
entire
strangers
i
have
the
honour
to
be
sir
your
most
obedient
and
very
humble
servant
john
podsnap
fledgeby
looked
at
the
three
blank
sides
of
this
note
quite
as
long
and
earnestly
as
at
the
first
expressive
side
and
then
looked
at
lammle
who
responded
with
another
extensive
sweep
of
his
right
arm
doing
is
this
said
fledgeby
to
imagine
said
lammle
suggested
fledgeby
after
reflecting
with
a
very
discontented
brow
has
been
giving
you
a
bad
character
you
said
lammle
with
a
deeper
frown
mr
fledgeby
appeared
to
be
on
the
verge
of
some
mutinous
expressions
when
his
hand
happened
to
touch
his
nose
a
certain
remembrance
connected
with
that
feature
operating
as
a
timely
warning
he
took
it
thoughtfully
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
and
pondered
lammle
meanwhile
eyeing
him
with
furtive
eyes
said
fledgeby
wo
improve
with
talking
about
if
we
ever
find
out
who
did
it
we
mark
that
person
there
nothing
more
to
be
said
except
that
you
undertook
to
do
what
circumstances
prevent
your
doing
that
you
undertook
to
do
what
you
might
have
done
by
this
time
if
you
had
made
a
prompter
use
of
circumstances
snarled
lammle
that
remarked
fledgeby
with
his
hands
in
the
turkish
trousers
matter
of
opinion
fledgeby
said
lammle
in
a
bullying
tone
i
to
understand
that
you
in
any
way
reflect
upon
me
or
hint
dissatisfaction
with
me
in
this
affair
said
fledgeby
you
have
brought
my
promissory
note
in
your
pocket
and
now
hand
it
over
lammle
produced
it
not
without
reluctance
fledgeby
looked
at
it
identified
it
twisted
it
up
and
threw
it
into
the
fire
they
both
looked
at
it
as
it
blazed
went
out
and
flew
in
feathery
ash
up
the
chimney
mr
fledgeby
said
lammle
as
before
i
to
understand
that
you
in
any
way
reflect
upon
me
or
hint
dissatisfaction
with
me
in
this
affair
said
fledgeby
and
unreservedly
no
my
hand
mr
fledgeby
took
it
saying
if
we
ever
find
out
who
did
this
we
mark
that
person
and
in
the
most
friendly
manner
let
me
mention
one
thing
more
i
do
know
what
your
circumstances
are
and
i
ask
you
have
sustained
a
loss
here
many
men
are
liable
to
be
involved
at
times
and
you
may
be
or
you
may
not
be
but
whatever
you
do
lammle
do
do
do
i
beg
of
you
ever
fall
into
the
hands
of
pubsey
and
in
the
next
room
for
they
are
grinders
regular
flayers
and
grinders
my
dear
lammle
repeated
fledgeby
with
a
peculiar
relish
they
skin
you
by
the
inch
from
the
nape
of
your
neck
to
the
sole
of
your
foot
and
grind
every
inch
of
your
skin
to
you
have
seen
what
mr
riah
is
never
fall
into
his
hands
lammle
i
beg
of
you
as
a
friend
mr
lammle
disclosing
some
alarm
at
the
solemnity
of
this
affectionate
adjuration
demanded
why
the
devil
he
ever
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
pubsey
and
confess
the
fact
i
was
made
a
little
uneasy
said
the
candid
fledgeby
the
manner
in
which
that
jew
looked
at
you
when
he
heard
your
name
i
did
like
his
eye
but
it
may
have
been
the
heated
fancy
of
a
friend
of
course
if
you
are
sure
that
you
have
no
personal
security
out
which
you
may
not
be
quite
equal
to
meeting
and
which
can
have
got
into
his
hands
it
must
have
been
fancy
still
i
did
like
his
eye
the
brooding
lammle
with
certain
white
dints
coming
and
going
in
his
palpitating
nose
looked
as
if
some
tormenting
imp
were
pinching
it
fledgeby
watching
him
with
a
twitch
in
his
mean
face
which
did
duty
there
for
a
smile
looked
very
like
the
tormentor
who
was
pinching
i
must
keep
him
waiting
too
long
said
fledgeby
revenge
it
on
my
unfortunate
friend
how
your
very
clever
and
agreeable
wife
she
knows
we
have
broken
down
showed
her
the
letter
much
surprised
asked
fledgeby
think
she
would
have
been
more
so
answered
lammle
there
had
been
more
go
in
you
she
lays
it
upon
me
then
fledgeby
i
will
not
have
my
words
misconstrued
break
out
lammle
urged
fledgeby
in
a
submissive
tone
there
no
occasion
i
only
asked
a
question
then
she
lay
it
upon
me
to
ask
another
question
sir
good
said
fledgeby
plainly
seeing
that
she
did
compliments
to
her
they
shook
hands
and
lammle
strode
out
pondering
fledgeby
saw
him
into
the
fog
and
returning
to
the
fire
and
musing
with
his
face
to
it
stretched
the
legs
of
the
turkish
trousers
wide
apart
and
meditatively
bent
his
knees
as
if
he
were
going
down
upon
them
have
a
pair
of
whiskers
lammle
which
i
never
liked
murmured
fledgeby
which
money
ca
produce
you
are
boastful
of
your
manners
and
your
conversation
you
wanted
to
pull
my
nose
and
you
have
let
me
in
for
a
failure
and
your
wife
says
i
am
the
cause
of
it
bowl
you
down
i
will
though
i
have
no
whiskers
here
he
rubbed
the
places
where
they
were
due
no
manners
and
no
conversation
having
thus
relieved
his
noble
mind
he
collected
the
legs
of
the
turkish
trousers
straightened
himself
on
his
knees
and
called
out
to
riah
in
the
next
room
you
sir
at
sight
of
the
old
man
with
a
gentleness
monstrously
in
contrast
with
the
character
he
had
given
him
mr
fledgeby
was
so
tickled
again
that
he
exclaimed
laughing
good
upon
my
soul
it
is
uncommon
good
old
proceeded
fledgeby
when
he
had
had
his
laugh
out
buy
up
these
lots
that
i
mark
with
my
pencil
there
a
tick
there
and
a
tick
there
and
a
tick
there
and
i
wager
afterwards
go
on
squeezing
those
christians
like
the
jew
you
are
now
next
you
want
a
cheque
or
you
say
you
want
it
though
capital
enough
somewhere
if
one
only
knew
where
but
you
be
peppered
and
salted
and
grilled
on
a
gridiron
before
you
own
to
it
and
that
cheque
i
write
when
he
had
unlocked
a
drawer
and
taken
a
key
from
it
to
open
another
drawer
in
which
was
another
key
that
opened
another
drawer
in
which
was
another
key
that
opened
another
drawer
in
which
was
the
cheque
book
and
when
he
had
written
the
cheque
and
when
reversing
the
key
and
drawer
process
he
had
placed
his
cheque
book
in
safety
again
he
beckoned
the
old
man
with
the
folded
cheque
to
come
and
take
it
said
fledgeby
when
the
jew
had
put
it
in
his
pocketbook
and
was
putting
that
in
the
breast
of
his
outer
garment
much
at
present
for
my
affairs
now
a
word
about
affairs
that
are
not
exactly
mine
where
is
she
with
his
hand
not
yet
withdrawn
from
the
breast
of
his
garment
riah
started
and
paused
said
fledgeby
expect
it
where
have
you
hidden
her
showing
that
he
was
taken
by
surprise
the
old
man
looked
at
his
master
with
some
passing
confusion
which
the
master
highly
enjoyed
she
in
the
house
i
pay
rent
and
taxes
for
in
saint
mary
axe
demanded
fledgeby
sir
she
in
your
garden
up
atop
of
that
house
gone
up
to
be
dead
or
whatever
the
game
is
asked
fledgeby
sir
is
she
then
riah
bent
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
as
if
considering
whether
he
could
answer
the
question
without
breach
of
faith
and
then
silently
raised
them
to
fledgeby
face
as
if
he
could
not
said
fledgeby
wo
press
that
just
now
but
i
want
to
know
this
and
i
will
know
this
mind
you
what
are
you
up
to
the
old
man
with
an
apologetic
action
of
his
head
and
hands
as
not
comprehending
the
master
meaning
addressed
to
him
a
look
of
mute
inquiry
ca
be
a
gallivanting
dodger
said
fledgeby
you
a
regular
pity
the
sorrows
you
know
if
you
do
know
any
christian
rhyme
whose
trembling
limbs
have
borne
him
to
et
cetrer
you
one
of
the
patriarchs
you
a
shaky
old
card
and
you
ca
be
in
love
with
this
lizzie
sir
expostulated
riah
sir
sir
sir
why
retorted
fledgeby
with
some
slight
tinge
of
a
blush
you
out
with
your
reason
for
having
your
spoon
in
the
soup
at
all
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
but
your
pardon
for
the
stipulation
it
is
in
sacred
confidence
it
is
strictly
upon
honour
too
cried
fledgeby
with
a
mocking
lip
among
jews
well
cut
away
is
upon
honour
sir
the
other
still
stipulated
with
respectful
firmness
certainly
honour
bright
said
fledgeby
the
old
man
never
bidden
to
sit
down
stood
with
an
earnest
hand
laid
on
the
back
of
the
young
man
easy
chair
the
young
man
sat
looking
at
the
fire
with
a
face
of
listening
curiosity
ready
to
check
him
off
and
catch
him
tripping
away
said
fledgeby
with
your
motive
i
have
no
motive
but
to
help
the
helpless
mr
fledgeby
could
only
express
the
feelings
to
which
this
incredible
statement
gave
rise
in
his
breast
by
a
prodigiously
long
derisive
sniff
i
came
to
know
and
much
to
esteem
and
to
respect
this
damsel
i
mentioned
when
you
saw
her
in
my
poor
garden
on
the
said
the
jew
you
said
fledgeby
distrustfully
perhaps
you
did
though
better
i
knew
her
the
more
interest
i
felt
in
her
fortunes
they
gathered
to
a
crisis
i
found
her
beset
by
a
selfish
and
ungrateful
brother
beset
by
an
unacceptable
wooer
beset
by
the
snares
of
a
more
powerful
lover
beset
by
the
wiles
of
her
own
heart
took
to
one
of
the
chaps
then
it
was
only
natural
that
she
should
incline
towards
him
for
he
had
many
and
great
advantages
but
he
was
not
of
her
station
and
to
marry
her
was
not
in
his
mind
perils
were
closing
round
her
and
the
circle
was
fast
darkening
when
i
being
as
you
have
said
sir
too
old
and
broken
to
be
suspected
of
any
feeling
for
her
but
a
father
stepped
in
and
counselled
flight
i
said
my
daughter
there
are
times
of
moral
danger
when
the
hardest
virtuous
resolution
to
form
is
flight
and
when
the
most
heroic
bravery
is
she
answered
she
had
had
this
in
her
thoughts
but
whither
to
fly
without
help
she
knew
not
and
there
were
none
to
help
her
i
showed
her
there
was
one
to
help
her
and
it
was
i
and
she
is
gone
did
you
do
with
her
asked
fledgeby
feeling
his
cheek
placed
her
said
the
old
man
a
distance
with
a
grave
smooth
outward
sweep
from
one
another
of
his
two
open
hands
at
arm
length
a
distance
among
certain
of
our
people
where
her
industry
would
serve
her
and
where
she
could
hope
to
exercise
it
unassailed
from
any
quarter
fledgeby
eyes
had
come
from
the
fire
to
notice
the
action
of
his
hands
when
he
said
a
distance
fledgeby
now
tried
very
unsuccessfully
to
imitate
that
action
as
he
shook
his
head
and
said
her
in
that
direction
did
you
oh
you
circular
old
dodger
with
one
hand
across
his
breast
and
the
other
on
the
easy
chair
riah
without
justifying
himself
waited
for
further
questioning
but
that
it
was
hopeless
to
question
him
on
that
one
reserved
point
fledgeby
with
his
small
eyes
too
near
together
saw
full
well
said
fledgeby
looking
at
the
fire
again
and
then
looking
up
lizzie
you
did
tell
me
the
other
name
in
your
garden
atop
of
the
house
i
be
more
communicative
with
you
the
other
name
hexam
riah
bent
his
head
in
assent
here
you
sir
said
fledgeby
have
a
notion
i
know
something
of
the
inveigling
chap
the
powerful
one
has
he
anything
to
do
with
the
law
i
believe
it
his
calling
thought
so
name
anything
like
lightwood
not
at
all
like
old
said
fledgeby
meeting
his
eyes
with
a
wink
the
name
jupiter
cried
fledgeby
one
is
it
i
thought
it
might
be
the
other
but
i
never
dreamt
of
that
one
i
should
object
to
your
baulking
either
of
the
pair
dodger
for
they
are
both
conceited
enough
but
that
one
is
as
cool
a
customer
as
ever
i
met
with
got
a
beard
besides
and
presumes
upon
it
well
done
old
go
on
and
prosper
brightened
by
this
unexpected
commendation
riah
asked
were
there
more
instructions
for
him
said
fledgeby
may
toddle
now
judah
and
grope
about
on
the
orders
you
have
got
dismissed
with
those
pleasing
words
the
old
man
took
his
broad
hat
and
staff
and
left
the
great
presence
more
as
if
he
were
some
superior
creature
benignantly
blessing
mr
fledgeby
than
the
poor
dependent
on
whom
he
set
his
foot
left
alone
mr
fledgeby
locked
his
outer
door
and
came
back
to
his
fire
done
you
said
fascination
to
himself
you
may
be
sure
you
are
this
he
twice
or
thrice
repeated
with
much
complacency
as
he
again
dispersed
the
legs
of
the
turkish
trousers
and
bent
the
knees
tidy
shot
that
i
flatter
myself
he
then
soliloquised
a
jew
brought
down
with
it
now
when
i
heard
the
story
told
at
lammle
i
did
make
a
jump
at
riah
not
a
hit
of
it
i
got
at
him
by
degrees
herein
he
was
quite
accurate
it
being
his
habit
not
to
jump
or
leap
or
make
an
upward
spring
at
anything
in
life
but
to
crawl
at
everything
got
at
him
pursued
fledgeby
feeling
for
his
whisker
degrees
if
your
lammles
or
your
lightwoods
had
got
at
him
anyhow
they
would
have
asked
him
the
question
whether
he
had
something
to
do
with
that
gal
disappearance
i
knew
a
better
way
of
going
to
work
having
got
behind
the
hedge
and
put
him
in
the
light
i
took
a
shot
at
him
and
brought
him
down
plump
oh
it
do
count
for
much
being
a
jew
in
a
match
against
me
another
dry
twist
in
place
of
a
smile
made
his
face
crooked
here
to
christians
proceeded
fledgeby
out
particularly
you
that
lodge
in
queer
street
i
have
got
the
run
of
queer
street
now
and
you
shall
see
some
games
there
to
work
a
lot
of
power
over
you
and
you
not
know
it
knowing
as
you
think
yourselves
would
be
almost
worth
laying
out
money
upon
but
when
it
comes
to
squeezing
a
profit
out
of
you
into
the
bargain
it
something
like
with
this
apostrophe
mr
fledgeby
appropriately
proceeded
to
divest
himself
of
his
turkish
garments
and
invest
himself
with
christian
attire
pending
which
operation
and
his
morning
ablutions
and
his
anointing
of
himself
with
the
last
infallible
preparation
for
the
production
of
luxuriant
and
glossy
hair
upon
the
human
countenance
quacks
being
the
only
sages
he
believed
in
besides
usurers
the
murky
fog
closed
about
him
and
shut
him
up
in
its
sooty
embrace
if
it
had
never
let
him
out
any
more
the
world
would
have
had
no
irreparable
loss
but
could
have
easily
replaced
him
from
its
stock
on
hand
chapter
a
respected
friend
in
a
new
aspect
in
the
evening
of
this
same
foggy
day
when
the
yellow
of
pubsey
and
was
drawn
down
upon
the
day
work
riah
the
jew
once
more
came
forth
into
saint
mary
axe
but
this
time
he
carried
no
bag
and
was
not
bound
on
his
master
affairs
he
passed
over
london
bridge
and
returned
to
the
middlesex
shore
by
that
of
westminster
and
so
ever
wading
through
the
fog
waded
to
the
doorstep
of
the
dolls
dressmaker
miss
wren
expected
him
he
could
see
her
through
the
window
by
the
light
of
her
low
fire
carefully
banked
up
with
damp
cinders
that
it
might
last
the
longer
and
waste
the
less
when
she
was
out
sitting
waiting
for
him
in
her
bonnet
his
tap
at
the
glass
roused
her
from
the
musing
solitude
in
which
she
sat
and
she
came
to
the
door
to
open
it
aiding
her
steps
with
a
little
evening
godmother
said
miss
jenny
wren
the
old
man
laughed
and
gave
her
his
arm
to
lean
on
you
come
in
and
warm
yourself
godmother
asked
miss
jenny
wren
if
you
are
ready
cinderella
my
dear
exclaimed
miss
wren
delighted
you
are
a
clever
old
boy
if
we
gave
prizes
at
this
establishment
but
we
only
keep
blanks
you
should
have
the
first
silver
medal
for
taking
me
up
so
quick
as
she
spake
thus
miss
wren
removed
the
key
of
the
from
the
keyhole
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
and
then
bustlingly
closed
the
door
and
tried
it
as
they
both
stood
on
the
step
satisfied
that
her
dwelling
was
safe
she
drew
one
hand
through
the
old
man
arm
and
prepared
to
ply
her
with
the
other
but
the
key
was
an
instrument
of
such
gigantic
proportions
that
before
they
started
riah
proposed
to
carry
it
no
no
i
carry
it
myself
returned
miss
wren
awfully
lopsided
you
know
and
stowed
down
in
my
pocket
it
trim
the
ship
to
let
you
into
a
secret
godmother
i
wear
my
pocket
on
my
high
side
purpose
with
that
they
began
their
plodding
through
the
fog
it
was
truly
sharp
of
you
godmother
resumed
miss
wren
with
great
approbation
understand
me
but
you
see
you
are
so
like
the
fairy
godmother
in
the
bright
little
books
you
look
so
unlike
the
rest
of
people
and
so
much
as
if
you
had
changed
yourself
into
that
shape
just
this
moment
with
some
benevolent
object
boh
cried
miss
jenny
putting
her
face
close
to
the
old
man
can
see
your
features
godmother
behind
the
beard
the
fancy
go
to
my
changing
other
objects
too
jenny
that
it
does
if
you
only
borrow
my
stick
and
tap
this
piece
of
pavement
this
dirty
stone
that
my
foot
taps
it
would
start
up
a
coach
and
six
i
say
let
believe
so
all
my
heart
replied
the
good
old
man
i
tell
you
what
i
must
ask
you
to
do
godmother
i
must
ask
you
to
be
so
kind
as
give
my
child
a
tap
and
change
him
altogether
o
my
child
has
been
such
a
bad
bad
child
of
late
it
worries
me
nearly
out
of
my
wits
not
done
a
stroke
of
work
these
ten
days
has
had
the
horrors
too
and
fancied
that
four
men
in
red
wanted
to
throw
him
into
a
fiery
furnace
that
dangerous
jenny
godmother
my
child
is
always
dangerous
more
or
less
he
might
here
the
little
creature
glanced
back
over
her
shoulder
at
the
sky
setting
the
house
on
fire
at
this
present
moment
i
do
know
who
would
have
a
child
for
my
part
it
no
use
shaking
him
i
have
shaken
him
till
i
have
made
myself
giddy
why
do
you
mind
your
commandments
and
honour
your
parent
you
naughty
old
boy
i
said
to
him
all
the
time
but
he
only
whimpered
and
stared
at
me
shall
be
changed
after
him
asked
riah
in
a
compassionately
playful
voice
my
word
godmother
i
am
afraid
i
must
be
selfish
next
and
get
you
to
set
me
right
in
the
back
and
the
legs
it
a
little
thing
to
you
with
your
power
godmother
but
it
a
great
deal
to
poor
weak
aching
me
there
was
no
querulous
complaining
in
the
words
but
they
were
not
the
less
touching
for
that
then
and
then
you
know
godmother
we
both
jump
up
into
the
coach
and
six
and
go
to
lizzie
this
reminds
me
godmother
to
ask
you
a
serious
question
you
are
as
wise
as
wise
can
be
having
been
brought
up
by
the
fairies
and
you
can
tell
me
this
is
it
better
to
have
had
a
good
thing
and
lost
it
or
never
to
have
had
it
feel
so
much
more
solitary
and
helpless
without
lizzie
now
than
i
used
to
feel
before
i
knew
her
tears
were
in
her
eyes
as
she
said
so
beloved
companionship
fades
out
of
most
lives
my
dear
said
the
jew
of
a
wife
and
a
fair
daughter
and
a
son
of
promise
has
faded
out
of
my
own
life
but
the
happiness
was
said
miss
wren
thoughtfully
by
no
means
convinced
and
chopping
the
exclamation
with
that
sharp
little
hatchet
of
hers
i
tell
you
what
change
i
think
you
had
better
begin
with
godmother
you
had
better
change
is
into
was
and
was
into
is
and
keep
them
so
that
suit
your
case
would
you
not
be
always
in
pain
then
asked
the
old
man
tenderly
exclaimed
miss
wren
with
another
chop
have
changed
me
wiser
not
she
added
with
the
quaint
hitch
of
her
chin
and
eyes
you
need
be
a
very
wonderful
godmother
to
do
that
deed
thus
conversing
and
having
crossed
westminster
bridge
they
traversed
the
ground
that
riah
had
lately
traversed
and
new
ground
likewise
for
when
they
had
recrossed
the
thames
by
way
of
london
bridge
they
struck
down
by
the
river
and
held
their
still
foggier
course
that
way
but
previously
as
they
were
going
along
jenny
twisted
her
venerable
friend
aside
to
a
window
and
said
look
at
all
my
work
this
referred
to
a
dazzling
semicircle
of
dolls
in
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
who
were
dressed
for
presentation
at
court
for
going
to
balls
for
going
out
driving
for
going
out
on
horseback
for
going
out
walking
for
going
to
get
married
for
going
to
help
other
dolls
to
get
married
for
all
the
gay
events
of
life
pretty
pretty
said
the
old
man
with
a
clap
of
his
hands
elegant
taste
you
like
returned
miss
wren
loftily
the
fun
is
godmother
how
i
make
the
great
ladies
try
my
dresses
on
though
the
hardest
part
of
my
business
and
would
be
even
if
my
back
were
not
bad
and
my
legs
queer
he
looked
at
her
as
not
understanding
what
she
said
you
godmother
said
miss
wren
have
to
scud
about
town
at
all
hours
if
it
was
only
sitting
at
my
bench
cutting
out
and
sewing
it
would
be
comparatively
easy
work
but
it
the
by
the
great
ladies
that
takes
it
out
of
me
the
asked
riah
a
mooney
godmother
you
are
after
all
returned
miss
wren
here
there
a
drawing
room
or
a
grand
day
in
the
park
or
a
show
or
a
fete
or
what
you
like
very
well
i
squeeze
among
the
crowd
and
i
look
about
me
when
i
see
a
great
lady
very
suitable
for
my
business
i
say
you
do
my
dear
and
i
take
particular
notice
of
her
and
run
home
and
cut
her
out
and
baste
her
then
another
day
i
come
scudding
back
again
to
try
on
and
then
i
take
particular
notice
of
her
again
sometimes
she
plainly
seems
to
say
that
little
creature
is
staring
and
sometimes
likes
it
and
sometimes
do
but
much
more
often
yes
than
no
all
the
time
i
am
only
saying
to
myself
i
must
hollow
out
a
bit
here
i
must
slope
away
there
and
i
am
making
a
perfect
slave
of
her
with
making
her
try
on
my
doll
dress
evening
parties
are
severer
work
for
me
because
there
only
a
doorway
for
a
full
view
and
what
with
hobbling
among
the
wheels
of
the
carriages
and
the
legs
of
the
horses
i
fully
expect
to
be
run
over
some
night
however
there
i
have
just
the
same
when
they
go
bobbing
into
the
hall
from
the
carriage
and
catch
a
glimpse
of
my
little
physiognomy
poked
out
from
behind
a
policeman
cape
in
the
rain
i
dare
say
they
think
i
am
wondering
and
admiring
with
all
my
eyes
and
heart
but
they
little
think
they
only
working
for
my
dolls
there
was
lady
belinda
whitrose
i
made
her
do
double
duty
in
one
night
i
said
when
she
came
out
of
the
carriage
you
do
my
dear
and
i
ran
straight
home
and
cut
her
out
and
basted
her
back
i
came
again
and
waited
behind
the
men
that
called
the
carriages
very
bad
night
too
at
last
lady
belinda
whitrose
carriage
lady
belinda
whitrose
coming
down
and
i
made
her
try
on
oh
and
take
pains
about
it
too
before
she
got
seated
lady
belinda
hanging
up
by
the
waist
much
too
near
the
gaslight
for
a
wax
one
with
her
toes
turned
in
when
they
had
plodded
on
for
some
time
nigh
the
river
riah
asked
the
way
to
a
certain
tavern
called
the
six
jolly
fellowship
porters
following
the
directions
he
received
they
arrived
after
two
or
three
puzzled
stoppages
for
consideration
and
some
uncertain
looking
about
them
at
the
door
of
miss
abbey
potterson
dominions
a
peep
through
the
glass
portion
of
the
door
revealed
to
them
the
glories
of
the
bar
and
miss
abbey
herself
seated
in
state
on
her
snug
throne
reading
the
newspaper
to
whom
with
deference
they
presented
themselves
taking
her
eyes
off
her
newspaper
and
pausing
with
a
suspended
expression
of
countenance
as
if
she
must
finish
the
paragraph
in
hand
before
undertaking
any
other
business
whatever
miss
abbey
demanded
with
some
slight
asperity
then
what
for
you
we
see
miss
potterson
asked
the
old
man
uncovering
his
head
not
only
could
but
you
can
and
you
do
replied
the
hostess
we
speak
with
you
madam
by
this
time
miss
abbey
eyes
had
possessed
themselves
of
the
small
figure
of
miss
jenny
wren
for
the
closer
observation
of
which
miss
abbey
laid
aside
her
newspaper
rose
and
looked
over
the
of
the
bar
the
seemed
to
entreat
for
its
owner
leave
to
come
in
and
rest
by
the
fire
so
miss
abbey
opened
the
and
said
as
though
replying
to
the
come
in
and
rest
by
the
fire
name
is
riah
said
the
old
man
with
courteous
action
my
avocation
is
in
london
city
this
my
young
companion
a
bit
interposed
miss
wren
give
the
lady
my
card
she
produced
it
from
her
pocket
with
an
air
after
struggling
with
the
gigantic
which
had
got
upon
the
top
of
it
and
kept
it
down
miss
abbey
with
manifest
tokens
of
astonishment
took
the
diminutive
document
and
found
it
to
run
concisely
thus
miss
jenny
wren
dolls
dressmaker
dolls
attended
at
their
own
residences
exclaimed
miss
potterson
staring
and
dropped
the
card
take
the
liberty
of
coming
my
young
companion
and
i
madam
said
riah
behalf
of
lizzie
hexam
miss
potterson
was
stooping
to
loosen
the
of
the
dressmaker
she
looked
round
rather
angrily
and
said
hexam
is
a
very
proud
young
woman
would
be
so
proud
returned
riah
dexterously
stand
well
in
your
good
opinion
that
before
she
quitted
london
for
where
in
the
name
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
asked
miss
potterson
as
though
supposing
her
to
have
emigrated
the
country
was
the
cautious
answer
made
us
promise
to
come
and
show
you
a
paper
which
she
left
in
our
hands
for
that
special
purpose
i
am
an
unserviceable
friend
of
hers
who
began
to
know
her
after
her
departure
from
this
neighbourhood
she
has
been
for
some
time
living
with
my
young
companion
and
has
been
a
helpful
and
a
comfortable
friend
to
her
much
needed
madam
he
added
in
a
lower
voice
me
if
you
knew
all
much
needed
can
believe
that
said
miss
abbey
with
a
softening
glance
at
the
little
creature
if
it
proud
to
have
a
heart
that
never
hardens
and
a
temper
that
never
tires
and
a
touch
that
never
hurts
miss
jenny
struck
in
flushed
is
proud
and
if
it
not
she
is
not
her
set
purpose
of
contradicting
miss
abbey
point
blank
was
so
far
from
offending
that
dread
authority
as
to
elicit
a
gracious
smile
do
right
child
said
miss
abbey
speak
well
of
those
who
deserve
well
of
you
or
wrong
muttered
miss
wren
inaudibly
with
a
visible
hitch
of
her
chin
mean
to
do
it
and
you
may
make
up
your
mind
to
that
old
lady
is
the
paper
madam
said
the
jew
delivering
into
miss
potterson
hands
the
original
document
drawn
up
by
rokesmith
and
signed
by
riderhood
you
please
to
read
it
first
of
all
said
miss
abbey
did
you
ever
taste
shrub
child
miss
wren
shook
her
head
you
like
to
if
it
good
returned
miss
wren
shall
try
and
if
you
find
it
good
i
mix
some
for
you
with
hot
water
put
your
poor
little
feet
on
the
fender
it
a
cold
cold
night
and
the
fog
clings
so
as
miss
abbey
helped
her
to
turn
her
chair
her
loosened
bonnet
dropped
on
the
floor
what
lovely
hair
cried
miss
abbey
enough
to
make
wigs
for
all
the
dolls
in
the
world
what
a
quantity
that
a
quantity
returned
miss
wren
what
do
you
say
to
the
rest
of
it
as
she
spoke
she
untied
a
band
and
the
golden
stream
fell
over
herself
and
over
the
chair
and
flowed
down
to
the
ground
miss
abbey
admiration
seemed
to
increase
her
perplexity
she
beckoned
the
jew
towards
her
as
she
reached
down
the
from
its
niche
and
whispered
or
woman
in
years
was
the
answer
in
and
trial
are
talking
about
me
good
people
thought
miss
jenny
sitting
in
her
golden
bower
warming
her
feet
ca
hear
what
you
say
but
i
know
your
tricks
and
your
manners
the
shrub
when
tasted
from
a
spoon
perfectly
harmonizing
with
miss
jenny
palate
a
judicious
amount
was
mixed
by
miss
potterson
skilful
hands
whereof
riah
too
partook
after
this
preliminary
miss
abbey
read
the
document
and
as
often
as
she
raised
her
eyebrows
in
so
doing
the
watchful
miss
jenny
accompanied
the
action
with
an
expressive
and
emphatic
sip
of
the
shrub
and
water
far
as
this
goes
said
miss
abbey
potterson
when
she
had
read
it
several
times
and
thought
about
it
proves
what
did
much
need
proving
that
rogue
riderhood
is
a
villain
i
have
my
doubts
whether
he
is
not
the
villain
who
solely
did
the
deed
but
i
have
no
expectation
of
those
doubts
ever
being
cleared
up
now
i
believe
i
did
lizzie
father
wrong
but
never
lizzie
self
because
when
things
were
at
the
worst
i
trusted
her
had
perfect
confidence
in
her
and
tried
to
persuade
her
to
come
to
me
for
a
refuge
i
am
very
sorry
to
have
done
a
man
wrong
particularly
when
it
ca
be
undone
be
kind
enough
to
let
lizzie
know
what
i
say
not
forgetting
that
if
she
will
come
to
the
porters
after
all
bygones
being
bygones
she
will
find
a
home
at
the
porters
and
a
friend
at
the
porters
she
knows
miss
abbey
of
old
remind
her
and
she
knows
the
home
and
the
friend
is
likely
to
turn
out
i
am
generally
short
and
sweet
or
short
and
sour
according
as
it
may
be
and
as
opinions
vary
remarked
miss
abbey
that
about
all
i
have
got
to
say
and
enough
too
but
before
the
shrub
and
water
was
sipped
out
miss
abbey
bethought
herself
that
she
would
like
to
keep
a
copy
of
the
paper
by
her
not
long
sir
said
she
to
riah
perhaps
you
would
mind
just
jotting
it
down
the
old
man
willingly
put
on
his
spectacles
and
standing
at
the
little
desk
in
the
corner
where
miss
abbey
filed
her
receipts
and
kept
her
sample
phials
customers
scores
were
interdicted
by
the
strict
administration
of
the
porters
wrote
out
the
copy
in
a
fair
round
character
as
he
stood
there
doing
his
methodical
penmanship
his
ancient
scribelike
figure
intent
upon
the
work
and
the
little
dolls
dressmaker
sitting
in
her
golden
bower
before
the
fire
miss
abbey
had
her
doubts
whether
she
had
not
dreamed
those
two
rare
figures
into
the
bar
of
the
six
jolly
fellowships
and
might
not
wake
with
a
nod
next
moment
and
find
them
gone
miss
abbey
had
twice
made
the
experiment
of
shutting
her
eyes
and
opening
them
again
still
finding
the
figures
there
when
dreamlike
a
confused
hubbub
arose
in
the
public
room
as
she
started
up
and
they
all
three
looked
at
one
another
it
became
a
noise
of
clamouring
voices
and
of
the
stir
of
feet
then
all
the
windows
were
heard
to
be
hastily
thrown
up
and
shouts
and
cries
came
floating
into
the
house
from
the
river
a
moment
more
and
bob
gliddery
came
clattering
along
the
passage
with
the
noise
of
all
the
nails
in
his
boots
condensed
into
every
separate
nail
is
it
asked
miss
abbey
summut
run
down
in
the
fog
answered
bob
ever
so
many
people
in
the
river
to
put
on
all
the
kettles
cried
miss
abbey
that
the
boiler
full
get
a
bath
out
hang
some
blankets
to
the
fire
heat
some
stone
bottles
have
your
senses
about
you
you
girls
down
stairs
and
use
while
miss
abbey
partly
delivered
these
directions
to
bob
whom
she
seized
by
the
hair
and
whose
head
she
knocked
against
the
wall
as
a
general
injunction
to
vigilance
and
presence
of
mind
and
partly
hailed
the
kitchen
with
them
the
company
in
the
public
room
jostling
one
another
rushed
out
to
the
causeway
and
the
outer
noise
increased
and
look
said
miss
abbey
to
her
visitors
they
all
three
hurried
to
the
vacated
public
room
and
passed
by
one
of
the
windows
into
the
wooden
verandah
overhanging
the
river
anybody
down
there
know
what
has
happened
demanded
miss
abbey
in
her
voice
of
authority
a
steamer
miss
abbey
cried
one
blurred
figure
in
the
fog
always
is
a
steamer
miss
abbey
cried
another
her
lights
miss
abbey
wot
you
see
yonder
cried
another
off
her
steam
miss
abbey
and
that
what
makes
the
fog
and
the
noise
worse
do
you
see
explained
another
boats
were
putting
off
torches
were
lighting
up
people
were
rushing
tumultuously
to
the
water
edge
some
man
fell
in
with
a
splash
and
was
pulled
out
again
with
a
roar
of
laughter
the
drags
were
called
for
a
cry
for
the
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
what
was
going
on
upon
the
river
for
every
boat
that
put
off
sculled
into
the
fog
and
was
lost
to
view
at
a
boat
length
nothing
was
clear
but
that
the
unpopular
steamer
was
assailed
with
reproaches
on
all
sides
she
was
the
murderer
bound
for
gallows

the

that
even
then
the

awaited

floor
the

took
up

the

as
the

miss

at

said
she
turning
to
her
two
companions
the
very
man
who
made
the
declaration
we
have
just
had
in
our
hands
that
riderhood
chapter
the
same
respected
friend
in
more
aspects
than
one
in
sooth
it
is
riderhood
and
no
other
or
it
is
the
outer
husk
and
shell
of
riderhood
and
no
other
that
is
borne
into
miss
bedroom
supple
to
twist
and
turn
as
the
rogue
has
ever
been
he
is
sufficiently
rigid
now
and
not
without
much
shuffling
of
attendant
feet
and
tilting
of
his
bier
this
way
and
that
way
and
peril
even
of
his
sliding
off
it
and
being
tumbled
in
a
heap
over
the
balustrades
can
he
be
got
up
stairs
a
doctor
quoth
miss
abbey
and
then
his
daughter
on
both
of
which
errands
quick
messengers
depart
the
messenger
meets
the
doctor
halfway
coming
under
convoy
of
police
doctor
examines
the
dank
carcase
and
pronounces
not
hopefully
that
it
is
worth
while
trying
to
reanimate
the
same
all
the
best
means
are
at
once
in
action
and
everybody
present
lends
a
hand
and
a
heart
and
soul
no
one
has
the
least
regard
for
the
man
with
them
all
he
has
been
an
object
of
avoidance
suspicion
and
aversion
but
the
spark
of
life
within
him
is
curiously
separable
from
himself
now
and
they
have
a
deep
interest
in
it
probably
because
it
is
life
and
they
are
living
and
must
die
in
answer
to
the
doctor
inquiry
how
did
it
happen
and
was
anyone
to
blame
tom
tootle
gives
in
his
verdict
unavoidable
accident
and
no
one
to
blame
but
the
sufferer
was
slinking
about
in
his
boat
says
tom
slinking
were
not
to
speak
ill
of
the
dead
the
manner
of
the
man
when
he
come
right
athwart
the
steamer
bows
and
she
cut
him
in
two
mr
tootle
is
so
far
figurative
touching
the
dismemberment
as
that
he
means
the
boat
and
not
the
man
for
the
man
lies
whole
before
them
captain
joey
the
regular
customer
in
the
glazed
hat
is
a
pupil
of
the
old
school
and
having
insinuated
himself
into
the
chamber
in
the
execution
of
the
important
service
of
carrying
the
drowned
man
favours
the
doctor
with
a
sagacious
suggestion
that
the
body
should
be
hung
up
by
the
heels
says
captain
joey
mutton
in
a
butcher
shop
and
should
then
as
a
particularly
choice
manoeuvre
for
promoting
easy
respiration
be
rolled
upon
casks
these
scraps
of
the
wisdom
of
the
captain
ancestors
are
received
with
such
speechless
indignation
by
miss
abbey
that
she
instantly
seizes
the
captain
by
the
collar
and
without
a
single
word
ejects
him
not
presuming
to
remonstrate
from
the
scene
there
then
remain
to
assist
the
doctor
and
tom
only
those
three
other
regular
customers
bob
glamour
william
williams
and
jonathan
family
name
of
the
latter
if
any
unknown
to
who
are
quite
enough
miss
abbey
having
looked
in
to
make
sure
that
nothing
is
wanted
descends
to
the
bar
and
there
awaits
the
result
with
the
gentle
jew
and
miss
jenny
wren
if
you
are
not
gone
for
good
mr
riderhood
it
would
be
something
to
know
where
you
are
hiding
at
present
this
flabby
lump
of
mortality
that
we
work
so
hard
at
with
such
patient
perseverance
yields
no
sign
of
you
if
you
are
gone
for
good
rogue
it
is
very
solemn
and
if
you
are
coming
back
it
is
hardly
less
so
nay
in
the
suspense
and
mystery
of
the
latter
question
involving
that
of
where
you
may
be
now
there
is
a
solemnity
even
added
to
that
of
death
making
us
who
are
in
attendance
alike
afraid
to
look
on
you
and
to
look
off
you
and
making
those
below
start
at
the
least
sound
of
a
creaking
plank
in
the
floor
stay
did
that
eyelid
tremble
so
the
doctor
breathing
low
and
closely
watching
asks
himself
no
did
that
nostril
twitch
no
this
artificial
respiration
ceasing
do
i
feel
any
faint
flutter
under
my
hand
upon
the
chest
no
over
and
over
again
no
no
but
try
over
and
over
again
nevertheless
see
a
token
of
life
an
indubitable
token
of
life
the
spark
may
smoulder
and
go
out
or
it
may
glow
and
expand
but
see
the
four
rough
fellows
seeing
shed
tears
neither
riderhood
in
this
world
nor
riderhood
in
the
other
could
draw
tears
from
them
but
a
striving
human
soul
between
the
two
can
do
it
easily
he
is
struggling
to
come
back
now
he
is
almost
here
now
he
is
far
away
again
now
he
is
struggling
harder
to
get
back
and
yet
like
us
all
when
we
swoon
like
us
all
every
day
of
our
lives
when
we
wake
he
is
instinctively
unwilling
to
be
restored
to
the
consciousness
of
this
existence
and
would
be
left
dormant
if
he
could
bob
gliddery
returns
with
pleasant
riderhood
who
was
out
when
sought
for
and
hard
to
find
she
has
a
shawl
over
her
head
and
her
first
action
when
she
takes
it
off
weeping
and
curtseys
to
miss
abbey
is
to
wind
her
hair
up
you
miss
abbey
for
having
father
here
am
bound
to
say
girl
i
did
know
who
it
was
returns
miss
abbey
i
hope
it
would
have
been
pretty
much
the
same
if
i
had
known
poor
pleasant
fortified
with
a
sip
of
brandy
is
ushered
into
the
chamber
she
could
not
express
much
sentiment
about
her
father
if
she
were
called
upon
to
pronounce
his
funeral
oration
but
she
has
a
greater
tenderness
for
him
than
he
ever
had
for
her
and
crying
bitterly
when
she
sees
him
stretched
unconscious
asks
the
doctor
with
clasped
hands
there
no
hope
sir
o
poor
father
is
poor
father
dead
to
which
the
doctor
on
one
knee
beside
the
body
busy
and
watchful
only
rejoins
without
looking
round
my
girl
unless
you
have
the
to
be
perfectly
quiet
i
can
not
allow
you
to
remain
in
the
room
pleasant
consequently
wipes
her
eyes
with
her
which
is
in
fresh
need
of
being
wound
up
and
having
got
it
out
of
the
way
watches
with
terrified
interest
all
that
goes
on
her
natural
woman
aptitude
soon
renders
her
able
to
give
a
little
help
anticipating
the
want
of
this
or
that
she
quietly
has
it
ready
for
him
and
so
by
degrees
is
intrusted
with
the
charge
of
supporting
her
father
head
upon
her
arm
it
is
something
so
new
to
pleasant
to
see
her
father
an
object
of
sympathy
and
interest
to
find
any
one
very
willing
to
tolerate
his
society
in
this
world
not
to
say
pressingly
and
soothingly
entreating
him
to
belong
to
it
that
it
gives
her
a
sensation
she
never
experienced
before
some
hazy
idea
that
if
affairs
could
remain
thus
for
a
long
time
it
would
be
a
respectable
change
floats
in
her
mind
also
some
vague
idea
that
the
old
evil
is
drowned
out
of
him
and
that
if
he
should
happily
come
back
to
resume
his
occupation
of
the
empty
form
that
lies
upon
the
bed
his
spirit
will
be
altered
in
which
state
of
mind
she
kisses
the
stony
lips
and
quite
believes
that
the
impassive
hand
she
chafes
will
revive
a
tender
hand
if
it
revive
ever
sweet
delusion
for
pleasant
riderhood
but
they
minister
to
him
with
such
extraordinary
interest
their
anxiety
is
so
keen
their
vigilance
is
so
great
their
excited
joy
grows
so
intense
as
the
signs
of
life
strengthen
that
how
can
she
resist
it
poor
thing
and
now
he
begins
to
breathe
naturally
and
he
stirs
and
the
doctor
declares
him
to
have
come
back
from
that
inexplicable
journey
where
he
stopped
on
the
dark
road
and
to
be
here
tom
tootle
who
is
nearest
to
the
doctor
when
he
says
this
grasps
the
doctor
fervently
by
the
hand
bob
glamour
william
williams
and
jonathan
of
the
no
surname
all
shake
hands
with
one
another
round
and
with
the
doctor
too
bob
glamour
blows
his
nose
and
jonathan
of
the
no
surname
is
moved
to
do
likewise
but
lacking
a
pocket
handkerchief
abandons
that
outlet
for
his
emotion
pleasant
sheds
tears
deserving
her
own
name
and
her
sweet
delusion
is
at
its
height
there
is
intelligence
in
his
eyes
he
wants
to
ask
a
question
he
wonders
where
he
is
tell
him
you
were
run
down
on
the
river
and
are
at
miss
abbey
potterson
he
stares
at
his
daughter
stares
all
around
him
closes
his
eyes
and
lies
slumbering
on
her
arm
the
delusion
begins
to
fade
the
low
bad
unimpressible
face
is
coming
up
from
the
depths
of
the
river
or
what
other
depths
to
the
surface
again
as
he
grows
warm
the
doctor
and
the
four
men
cool
as
his
lineaments
soften
with
life
their
faces
and
their
hearts
harden
to
him
will
do
now
says
the
doctor
washing
his
hands
and
looking
at
the
patient
with
growing
disfavour
a
better
man
moralizes
tom
tootle
with
a
gloomy
shake
of
the
head
had
his
luck
to
be
hoped
he
make
a
better
use
of
his
life
says
bob
glamour
i
expect
he
will
than
he
done
afore
adds
william
williams
no
not
he
says
jonathan
of
the
no
surname
clinching
the
quartette
they
speak
in
a
low
tone
because
of
his
daughter
but
she
sees
that
they
have
all
drawn
off
and
that
they
stand
in
a
group
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
shunning
him
it
would
be
too
much
to
suspect
them
of
being
sorry
that
he
did
die
when
he
had
done
so
much
towards
it
but
they
clearly
wish
that
they
had
had
a
better
subject
to
bestow
their
pains
on
intelligence
is
conveyed
to
miss
abbey
in
the
bar
who
reappears
on
the
scene
and
contemplates
from
a
distance
holding
whispered
discourse
with
the
doctor
the
spark
of
life
was
deeply
interesting
while
it
was
in
abeyance
but
now
that
it
has
got
established
in
mr
riderhood
there
appears
to
be
a
general
desire
that
circumstances
had
admitted
of
its
being
developed
in
anybody
else
rather
than
that
gentleman
says
miss
abbey
cheering
them
up
have
done
your
duty
like
good
and
true
men
and
you
had
better
come
down
and
take
something
at
the
expense
of
the
porters
this
they
all
do
leaving
the
daughter
watching
the
father
to
whom
in
their
absence
bob
gliddery
presents
himself
gills
looks
rum
do
they
says
bob
after
inspecting
the
patient
pleasant
faintly
nods
gills
look
rummer
when
he
wakes
wo
they
says
bob
pleasant
hopes
not
why
he
finds
himself
here
you
know
bob
explains
miss
abbey
forbid
him
the
house
and
ordered
him
out
of
it
but
what
you
may
call
the
fates
ordered
him
into
it
again
which
is
rumness
ai
it
would
have
come
here
of
his
own
accord
returns
poor
pleasant
with
an
effort
at
a
little
pride
retorts
bob
he
would
have
been
let
in
if
he
had
the
short
delusion
is
quite
dispelled
now
as
plainly
as
she
sees
on
her
arm
the
old
father
unimproved
pleasant
sees
that
everybody
there
will
cut
him
when
he
recovers
consciousness
take
him
away
ever
so
soon
as
i
can
thinks
pleasant
with
a
sigh
best
at
home
presently
they
all
return
and
wait
for
him
to
become
conscious
that
they
will
all
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
him
some
clothes
are
got
together
for
him
to
wear
his
own
being
saturated
with
water
and
his
present
dress
being
composed
of
blankets
becoming
more
and
more
uncomfortable
as
though
the
prevalent
dislike
were
finding
him
out
somewhere
in
his
sleep
and
expressing
itself
to
him
the
patient
at
last
opens
his
eyes
wide
and
is
assisted
by
his
daughter
to
sit
up
in
bed
riderhood
says
the
doctor
do
you
feel
he
replies
gruffly
to
boast
on
having
in
fact
returned
to
life
in
an
uncommonly
sulky
state
do
mean
to
preach
but
i
hope
says
the
doctor
gravely
shaking
his
head
this
escape
may
have
a
good
effect
upon
you
riderhood
the
patient
discontented
growl
of
a
reply
is
not
intelligible
his
daughter
however
could
interpret
if
she
would
that
what
he
says
is
he
want
no
mr
riderhood
next
demands
his
shirt
and
draws
it
on
over
his
head
with
his
daughter
help
exactly
as
if
he
had
just
had
a
fight
it
a
steamer
he
pauses
to
ask
her
father
have
the
law
on
her
bust
her
and
make
her
pay
for
it
he
then
buttons
his

or
thrice
stopping
to
examine
his
arms
and
hands
as
if
to
see
what
punishment
he
has
received
in
the
fight
he
then
doggedly
demands
his
other
garments
and
slowly
gets
them
on
with
an
appearance
of
great
malevolence
towards
his
late
opponent
and
all
the
spectators
he
has
an
impression
that
his
nose
is
bleeding
and
several
times
draws
the
back
of
his
hand
across
it
and
looks
for
the
result
in
a
pugilistic
manner
greatly
strengthening
that
incongruous
resemblance

he
asks
in
a
surly
voice
when
he
has
shuffled
his
clothes
on
the
river
somebody

no
honest

are

on

mr

taking
from
the
hands
of
his
daughter
with
special
a
lent
cap
and
grumbling
as
he
pulls
it
down
over
his

getting
on

unsteady

heavily
upon

and

next

he
takes
his
departure
out
of
the
ring
in
which
he
has
had
that
little
with
death
chapter
a
happy
return
of
the
day
mr
and
mrs
wilfer
had
seen
a
full
quarter
of
a
hundred
more
anniversaries
of
their
wedding
day
than
mr
and
mrs
lammle
had
seen
of
theirs
but
they
still
celebrated
the
occasion
in
the
bosom
of
their
family
not
that
these
celebrations
ever
resulted
in
anything
particularly
agreeable
or
that
the
family
was
ever
disappointed
by
that
circumstance
on
account
of
having
looked
forward
to
the
return
of
the
auspicious
day
with
sanguine
anticipations
of
enjoyment
it
was
kept
morally
rather
as
a
fast
than
a
feast
enabling
mrs
wilfer
to
hold
a
sombre
darkling
state
which
exhibited
that
impressive
woman
in
her
choicest
colours
the
noble
lady
condition
on
these
delightful
occasions
was
one
compounded
of
heroic
endurance
and
heroic
forgiveness
lurid
indications
of
the
better
marriages
she
might
have
made
shone
athwart
the
awful
gloom
of
her
composure
and
fitfully
revealed
the
cherub
as
a
little
monster
unaccountably
favoured
by
heaven
who
had
possessed
himself
of
a
blessing
for
which
many
of
his
superiors
had
sued
and
contended
in
vain
so
firmly
had
this
his
position
towards
his
treasure
become
established
that
when
the
anniversary
arrived
it
always
found
him
in
an
apologetic
state
it
is
not
impossible
that
his
modest
penitence
may
have
even
gone
the
length
of
sometimes
severely
reproving
him
for
that
he
ever
took
the
liberty
of
making
so
exalted
a
character
his
wife
as
for
the
children
of
the
union
their
experience
of
these
festivals
had
been
sufficiently
uncomfortable
to
lead
them
annually
to
wish
when
out
of
their
tenderest
years
either
that
ma
had
married
somebody
else
instead
of
pa
or
that
pa
had
married
somebody
else
instead
of
ma
when
there
came
to
be
but
two
sisters
left
at
home
the
daring
mind
of
bella
on
the
next
of
these
occasions
scaled
the
height
of
wondering
with
droll
vexation
on
earth
pa
ever
could
have
seen
in
ma
to
induce
him
to
make
such
a
little
fool
of
himself
as
to
ask
her
to
have
him
the
revolving
year
now
bringing
the
day
round
in
its
orderly
sequence
bella
arrived
in
the
boffin
chariot
to
assist
at
the
celebration
it
was
the
family
custom
when
the
day
recurred
to
sacrifice
a
pair
of
fowls
on
the
altar
of
hymen
and
bella
had
sent
a
note
beforehand
to
intimate
that
she
would
bring
the
votive
offering
with
her
so
bella
and
the
fowls
by
the
united
energies
of
two
horses
two
men
four
wheels
and
a
carriage
dog
with
as
uncomfortable
a
collar
on
as
if
he
had
been
george
the
fourth
were
deposited
at
the
door
of
the
parental
dwelling
they
were
there
received
by
mrs
wilfer
in
person
whose
dignity
on
this
as
on
most
special
occasions
was
heightened
by
a
mysterious
toothache
shall
not
require
the
carriage
at
night
said
bella
shall
walk
back
the
male
domestic
of
mrs
boffin
touched
his
hat
and
in
the
act
of
departure
had
an
awful
glare
bestowed
upon
him
by
mrs
wilfer
intended
to
carry
deep
into
his
audacious
soul
the
assurance
that
whatever
his
private
suspicions
might
be
male
domestics
in
livery
were
no
rarity
there
dear
ma
said
bella
how
do
you
do
am
as
well
bella
replied
mrs
wilfer
can
be
expected
me
ma
said
bella
talk
as
if
one
was
just
born
exactly
what
ma
has
been
doing
interposed
lavvy
over
the
maternal
shoulder
since
we
got
up
this
morning
it
all
very
well
to
laugh
bella
but
anything
more
exasperating
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
mrs
wilfer
with
a
look
too
full
of
majesty
to
be
accompanied
by
any
words
attended
both
her
daughters
to
the
kitchen
where
the
sacrifice
was
to
be
prepared
rokesmith
said
she
resignedly
been
so
polite
as
to
place
his
at
our
disposal
you
will
therefore
bella
be
entertained
in
the
humble
abode
of
your
parents
so
far
in
accordance
with
your
present
style
of
living
that
there
will
be
a
for
your
reception
as
well
as
a
your
papa
invited
mr
rokesmith
to
partake
of
our
lowly
fare
in
excusing
himself
on
account
of
a
particular
engagement
he
offered
the
use
of
his
apartment
bella
happened
to
know
that
he
had
no
engagement
out
of
his
own
room
at
mr
boffin
but
she
approved
of
his
staying
away
should
only
have
put
one
another
out
of
countenance
she
thought
we
do
that
quite
often
enough
as
it
is
yet
she
had
sufficient
curiosity
about
his
room
to
run
up
to
it
with
the
least
possible
delay
and
make
a
close
inspection
of
its
contents
it
was
tastefully
though
economically
furnished
and
very
neatly
arranged
there
were
shelves
and
stands
of
books
english
french
and
italian
and
in
a
portfolio
on
the
there
were
sheets
upon
sheets
of
memoranda
and
calculations
in
figures
evidently
referring
to
the
boffin
property
on
that
table
also
carefully
backed
with
canvas
varnished
mounted
and
rolled
like
a
map
was
the
placard
descriptive
of
the
murdered
man
who
had
come
from
afar
to
be
her
husband
she
shrank
from
this
ghostly
surprise
and
felt
quite
frightened
as
she
rolled
and
tied
it
up
again
peeping
about
here
and
there
she
came
upon
a
print
a
graceful
head
of
a
pretty
woman
elegantly
framed
hanging
in
the
corner
by
the
easy
chair
indeed
sir
said
bella
after
stopping
to
ruminate
before
it
indeed
sir
i
fancy
i
can
guess
whom
you
think
that
like
but
i
tell
you
what
it
much
more
like
your
impudence
having
said
which
she
decamped
not
solely
because
she
was
offended
but
because
there
was
nothing
else
to
look
at
ma
said
bella
reappearing
in
the
kitchen
with
some
remains
of
a
blush
and
lavvy
think
magnificent
me
fit
for
nothing
but
i
intend
to
prove
the
contrary
i
mean
to
be
cook
today
rejoined
her
majestic
mother
can
not
permit
it
cook
in
that
dress
for
my
dress
ma
returned
bella
merrily
searching
in
a
mean
to
apron
it
and
towel
it
all
over
the
front
and
as
to
permission
i
mean
to
do
without
cook
said
mrs
wilfer
who
never
cooked
when
you
were
at
home
ma
returned
bella
is
precisely
the
state
of
the
case
she
girded
herself
with
a
white
apron
and
busily
with
knots
and
pins
contrived
a
bib
to
it
coming
close
and
tight
under
her
chin
as
if
it
had
caught
her
round
the
neck
to
kiss
her
over
this
bib
her
dimples
looked
delightful
and
under
it
her
pretty
figure
not
less
so
ma
said
bella
pushing
back
her
hair
from
her
temples
with
both
hands
first
returned
mrs
wilfer
solemnly
you
persist
in
what
i
can
not
but
regard
as
conduct
utterly
incompatible
with
the
equipage
in
which
you
arrived
i
do
ma
then
you
put
the
fowls
down
to
the
fire
be
sure
cried
bella
flour
them
and
twirl
them
round
and
there
they
go
sending
them
spinning
at
a
great
rate
next
ma
said
mrs
wilfer
with
a
wave
of
her
gloves
expressive
of
abdication
under
protest
from
the
culinary
throne
would
recommend
examination
of
the
bacon
in
the
saucepan
on
the
fire
and
also
of
the
potatoes
by
the
application
of
a
fork
preparation
of
the
greens
will
further
become
necessary
if
you
persist
in
this
unseemly
demeanour
of
course
i
do
ma
persisting
bella
gave
her
attention
to
one
thing
and
forgot
the
other
and
gave
her
attention
to
the
other
and
forgot
the
third
and
remembering
the
third
was
distracted
by
the
fourth
and
made
amends
whenever
she
went
wrong
by
giving
the
unfortunate
fowls
an
extra
spin
which
made
their
chance
of
ever
getting
cooked
exceedingly
doubtful
but
it
was
pleasant
cookery
too
meantime
miss
lavinia
oscillating
between
the
kitchen
and
the
opposite
room
prepared
the
in
the
latter
chamber
this
office
she
always
doing
her
household
spiriting
with
unwillingness
performed
in
a
startling
series
of
whisks
and
bumps
laying
the
as
if
she
were
raising
the
wind
putting
down
the
glasses
and
as
if
she
were
knocking
at
the
door
and
clashing
the
knives
and
forks
in
a
skirmishing
manner
suggestive
of
conflict
at
ma
whispered
lavinia
to
bella
when
this
was
done
and
they
stood
over
the
roasting
fowls
one
was
the
most
dutiful
child
in
existence
of
course
on
the
whole
one
hopes
one
is
is
she
enough
to
make
one
want
to
poke
her
with
something
wooden
sitting
there
bolt
upright
in
a
corner
suppose
returned
bella
poor
pa
was
to
sit
bolt
upright
in
another
corner
dear
he
could
do
it
said
lavvy
would
loll
directly
but
indeed
i
do
not
believe
there
ever
was
any
human
creature
who
could
keep
so
bolt
upright
as
ma
put
such
an
amount
of
aggravation
into
one
back
what
the
matter
ma
ai
you
well
ma
i
am
very
well
returned
mrs
wilfer
turning
her
eyes
upon
her
youngest
born
with
scornful
fortitude
should
be
the
matter
with
me
do
seem
very
brisk
ma
retorted
lavvy
the
bold
repeated
her
parent
whence
the
low
expression
lavinia
if
i
am
uncomplaining
if
i
am
silently
contented
with
my
lot
let
that
suffice
for
my
family
ma
returned
lavvy
you
will
force
it
out
of
me
i
must
respectfully
take
leave
to
say
that
your
family
are
no
doubt
under
the
greatest
obligations
to
you
for
having
an
annual
toothache
on
your
wedding
day
and
that
it
very
disinterested
in
you
and
an
immense
blessing
to
them
still
on
the
whole
it
is
possible
to
be
too
boastful
even
of
that
boon
incarnation
of
sauciness
said
mrs
wilfer
you
speak
like
that
to
me
on
this
day
of
all
days
in
the
year
pray
do
you
know
what
would
have
become
of
you
if
i
had
not
bestowed
my
hand
upon
your
father
on
this
day
ma
replied
lavvy
really
do
not
and
with
the
greatest
respect
for
your
abilities
and
information
i
very
much
doubt
if
you
do
either
whether
or
no
the
sharp
vigour
of
this
sally
on
a
weak
point
of
mrs
wilfer
entrenchments
might
have
routed
that
heroine
for
the
time
is
rendered
uncertain
by
the
arrival
of
a
flag
of
truce
in
the
person
of
mr
george
sampson
bidden
to
the
feast
as
a
friend
of
the
family
whose
affections
were
now
understood
to
be
in
course
of
transference
from
bella
to
lavinia
and
whom
lavinia
kept
possibly
in
remembrance
of
his
bad
taste
in
having
overlooked
her
in
the
first
instance
under
a
course
of
stinging
discipline
congratulate
you
mrs
wilfer
said
mr
george
sampson
who
had
meditated
this
neat
address
while
coming
along
the
day
mrs
wilfer
thanked
him
with
a
magnanimous
sigh
and
again
became
an
unresisting
prey
to
that
inscrutable
toothache
am
surprised
said
mr
sampson
feebly
miss
bella
condescends
to
cook
here
miss
lavinia
descended
on
the
young
gentleman
with
a
crushing
supposition
that
at
all
events
it
was
no
business
of
his
this
disposed
of
mr
sampson
in
a
melancholy
retirement
of
spirit
until
the
cherub
arrived
whose
amazement
at
the
lovely
woman
occupation
was
great
however
she
persisted
in
dishing
the
dinner
as
well
as
cooking
it
and
then
sat
down
bibless
and
apronless
to
partake
of
it
as
an
illustrious
guest
mrs
wilfer
first
responding
to
her
husband
cheerful
what
we
are
about
to
receive
with
a
sepulchral
amen
calculated
to
cast
a
damp
upon
the
stoutest
appetite
what
said
bella
as
she
watched
the
carving
of
the
fowls
them
pink
inside
i
wonder
pa
is
it
the
breed
i
do
think
it
the
breed
my
dear
returned
rather
think
it
is
because
they
are
not
done
ought
to
be
said
bella
i
am
aware
they
ought
to
be
my
dear
rejoined
her
father
they
ai
so
the
gridiron
was
put
in
requisition
and
the
cherub
who
was
often
as
employed
in
his
own
family
as
if
he
had
been
in
the
employment
of
some
of
the
old
masters
undertook
to
grill
the
fowls
indeed
except
in
respect
of
staring
about
him
a
branch
of
the
public
service
to
which
the
pictorial
cherub
is
much
addicted
this
domestic
cherub
discharged
as
many
odd
functions
as
his
prototype
with
the
difference
say
that
he
performed
with
a
on
the
family
boots
instead
of
performing
on
enormous
wind
instruments
and
and
that
he
conducted
himself
with
cheerful
alacrity
to
much
useful
purpose
instead
of
foreshortening
himself
in
the
air
with
the
vaguest
intentions
bella
helped
him
with
his
supplemental
cookery
and
made
him
very
happy
but
put
him
in
mortal
terror
too
by
asking
him
when
they
sat
down
at
table
again
how
he
supposed
they
cooked
fowls
at
the
greenwich
dinners
and
whether
he
believed
they
really
were
such
pleasant
dinners
as
people
said
his
secret
winks
and
nods
of
remonstrance
in
reply
made
the
mischievous
bella
laugh
until
she
choked
and
then
lavinia
was
obliged
to
slap
her
on
the
back
and
then
she
laughed
the
more
but
her
mother
was
a
fine
corrective
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
to
whom
her
father
in
the
innocence
of
his
at
intervals
appealed
with
dear
i
am
afraid
you
are
not
enjoying
yourself
so
r
she
would
sonorously
reply
my
dear
you
seem
a
little
out
of
sorts
at
all
would
be
the
rejoinder
in
exactly
the
same
tone
you
take
a
my
dear
you
i
will
take
whatever
you
please
but
my
dear
do
you
like
it
like
it
as
well
as
i
like
anything
the
stately
woman
would
then
with
a
meritorious
appearance
of
devoting
herself
to
the
general
good
pursue
her
dinner
as
if
she
were
feeding
somebody
else
on
high
public
grounds
bella
had
brought
dessert
and
two
bottles
of
wine
thus
shedding
unprecedented
splendour
on
the
occasion
mrs
wilfer
did
the
honours
of
the
first
glass
by
proclaiming
i
drink
to
you
you
my
dear
and
i
to
you
and
ma
said
bella
me
mrs
wilfer
interposed
with
outstretched
glove
i
think
not
i
drank
to
your
papa
if
however
you
insist
on
including
me
i
can
in
gratitude
offer
no
objection
lor
ma
interposed
lavvy
the
bold
it
the
day
that
made
you
and
pa
one
and
the
same
i
have
no
patience
whatever
other
circumstance
the
day
may
be
marked
it
is
not
the
day
lavinia
on
which
i
will
allow
a
child
of
mine
to
pounce
upon
me
i
beg
nay
command
that
you
will
not
pounce
it
is
appropriate
to
recall
that
it
is
for
you
to
command
and
for
me
to
obey
it
is
your
house
and
you
are
master
at
your
own
table
both
our
healths
drinking
the
toast
with
tremendous
stiffness
really
am
a
little
afraid
my
dear
hinted
the
cherub
meekly
you
are
not
enjoying
yourself
the
contrary
returned
mrs
wilfer
so
why
should
i
not
thought
my
dear
that
perhaps
your
face
might
face
might
be
a
martyrdom
but
what
would
that
import
or
who
should
know
it
if
i
smiled
and
she
did
smile
manifestly
freezing
the
blood
of
mr
george
sampson
by
so
doing
for
that
young
gentleman
catching
her
smiling
eye
was
so
very
much
appalled
by
its
expression
as
to
cast
about
in
his
thoughts
concerning
what
he
had
done
to
bring
it
down
upon
himself
mind
naturally
falls
said
mrs
wilfer
i
say
into
a
reverie
or
shall
i
say
into
a
retrospect
on
a
day
like
this
lavvy
sitting
with
defiantly
folded
arms
replied
but
not
audibly
goodness
sake
say
whichever
of
the
two
you
like
best
ma
and
get
it
over
mind
pursued
mrs
wilfer
in
an
oratorical
manner
reverts
to
papa
and
mamma
i
here
allude
to
my
parents
at
a
period
before
the
earliest
dawn
of
this
day
i
was
considered
tall
perhaps
i
was
papa
and
mamma
were
unquestionably
tall
i
have
rarely
seen
a
finer
women
than
my
mother
never
than
my
father
the
irrepressible
lavvy
remarked
aloud
grandpapa
was
he
was
a
female
grandpapa
retorted
mrs
wilfer
with
an
awful
look
and
in
an
awful
tone
what
i
describe
him
to
have
been
and
would
have
struck
any
of
his
grandchildren
to
the
earth
who
presumed
to
question
it
it
was
one
of
mamma
cherished
hopes
that
i
should
become
united
to
a
tall
member
of
society
it
may
have
been
a
weakness
but
if
so
it
was
equally
the
weakness
i
believe
of
king
frederick
of
prussia
these
remarks
being
offered
to
mr
george
sampson
who
had
not
the
courage
to
come
out
for
single
combat
but
lurked
with
his
chest
under
the
table
and
his
eyes
cast
down
mrs
wilfer
proceeded
in
a
voice
of
increasing
sternness
and
impressiveness
until
she
should
force
that
skulker
to
give
himself
up
would
appear
to
have
had
an
indefinable
foreboding
of
what
afterwards
happened
for
she
would
frequently
urge
upon
me
not
a
little
man
promise
me
my
child
not
a
little
man
never
never
never
marry
a
little
man
papa
also
would
remark
to
me
he
possessed
extraordinary
humour
that
a
family
of
whales
must
not
ally
themselves
with
his
company
was
eagerly
sought
as
may
be
supposed
by
the
wits
of
the
day
and
our
house
was
their
continual
resort
i
have
known
as
many
as
three
engravers
exchanging
the
most
exquisite
sallies
and
retorts
there
at
one
time
here
mr
sampson
delivered
himself
captive
and
said
with
an
uneasy
movement
on
his
chair
that
three
was
a
large
number
and
it
must
have
been
highly
entertaining
the
most
prominent
members
of
that
distinguished
circle
was
a
gentleman
measuring
six
feet
four
in
height
he
was
not
an
engraver
here
mr
sampson
said
with
no
reason
whatever
of
course
not
gentleman
was
so
obliging
as
to
honour
me
with
attentions
which
i
could
not
fail
to
understand
here
mr
sampson
murmured
that
when
it
came
to
that
you
could
always
tell
immediately
announced
to
both
my
parents
that
those
attentions
were
misplaced
and
that
i
could
not
favour
his
suit
they
inquired
was
he
too
tall
i
replied
it
was
not
the
stature
but
the
intellect
was
too
lofty
at
our
house
i
said
the
tone
was
too
brilliant
the
pressure
was
too
high
to
be
maintained
by
me
a
mere
woman
in
domestic
life
i
well
remember
mamma
clasping
her
hands
and
exclaiming
this
will
end
in
a
little
man
here
mr
sampson
glanced
at
his
host
and
shook
his
head
with
despondency
afterwards
went
so
far
as
to
predict
that
it
would
end
in
a
little
man
whose
mind
would
be
below
the
average
but
that
was
in
what
i
may
denominate
a
paroxysm
of
maternal
disappointment
within
a
month
said
mrs
wilfer
deepening
her
voice
as
if
she
were
relating
a
terrible
ghost
story
i
first
saw
my
husband
within
a
year
i
married
him
it
is
natural
for
the
mind
to
recall
these
dark
coincidences
on
the
present
day
mr
sampson
at
length
released
from
the
custody
of
mrs
wilfer
eye
now
drew
a
long
breath
and
made
the
original
and
striking
remark
that
there
was
no
accounting
for
these
sort
of
presentiments
scratched
his
head
and
looked
apologetically
all
round
the
table
until
he
came
to
his
wife
when
observing
her
as
it
were
shrouded
in
a
more
sombre
veil
than
before
he
once
more
hinted
dear
i
am
really
afraid
you
are
not
altogether
enjoying
yourself
to
which
she
once
more
replied
the
contrary
quite
so
the
wretched
mr
sampson
position
at
this
agreeable
entertainment
was
truly
pitiable
for
not
only
was
he
exposed
defenceless
to
the
harangues
of
mrs
wilfer
but
he
received
the
utmost
contumely
at
the
hands
of
lavinia
who
partly
to
show
bella
that
she
lavinia
could
do
what
she
liked
with
him
and
partly
to
pay
him
off
for
still
obviously
admiring
bella
beauty
led
him
the
life
of
a
dog
illuminated
on
the
one
hand
by
the
stately
graces
of
mrs
wilfer
oratory
and
shadowed
on
the
other
by
the
checks
and
frowns
of
the
young
lady
to
whom
he
had
devoted
himself
in
his
destitution
the
sufferings
of
this
young
gentleman
were
distressing
to
witness
if
his
mind
for
the
moment
reeled
under
them
it
may
be
urged
in
extenuation
of
its
weakness
that
it
was
constitutionally
a
mind
and
never
very
strong
upon
its
legs
the
rosy
hours
were
thus
beguiled
until
it
was
time
for
bella
to
have
pa
escort
back
the
dimples
duly
tied
up
in
the
and
the
done
they
got
out
into
the
air
and
the
cherub
drew
a
long
breath
as
if
he
found
it
refreshing
dear
pa
said
bella
anniversary
may
be
considered
over
my
dear
returned
the
cherub
another
of
gone
bella
drew
his
arm
closer
through
hers
as
they
walked
along
and
gave
it
a
number
of
consolatory
pats
you
my
dear
he
said
as
if
she
had
spoken
am
all
right
my
dear
well
and
how
do
you
get
on
bella
am
not
at
all
improved
you
really
though
on
the
contrary
i
am
worse
said
the
cherub
am
worse
pa
i
make
so
many
calculations
how
much
a
year
i
must
have
when
i
marry
and
what
is
the
least
i
can
manage
to
do
with
that
i
am
beginning
to
get
wrinkles
over
my
nose
did
you
notice
any
wrinkles
over
my
nose
this
evening
pa
pa
laughing
at
this
bella
gave
him
two
or
three
shakes
wo
laugh
sir
when
you
see
your
lovely
woman
turning
haggard
you
had
better
be
prepared
in
time
i
can
tell
you
i
shall
not
be
able
to
keep
my
greediness
for
money
out
of
my
eyes
long
and
when
you
see
it
there
you
be
sorry
and
serve
you
right
for
not
being
warned
in
time
now
sir
we
entered
into
a
bond
of
confidence
have
you
anything
to
impart
thought
it
was
you
who
was
to
impart
my
love
did
you
indeed
sir
then
why
did
you
ask
me
the
moment
we
came
out
the
confidences
of
lovely
women
are
not
to
be
slighted
however
i
forgive
you
this
once
and
look
here
pa
bella
laid
the
little
forefinger
of
her
right
glove
on
her
lip
and
then
laid
it
on
her
father
lip
a
kiss
for
you
and
now
i
am
going
seriously
to
tell
you
let
me
see
how
many
four
secrets
mind
serious
grave
weighty
secrets
strictly
between
ourselves
one
my
dear
said
her
father
settling
her
arm
comfortably
and
confidentially
one
said
bella
electrify
you
who
do
you
think
has
she
was
confused
here
in
spite
of
her
merry
way
of
beginning
made
an
offer
to
me
pa
looked
in
her
face
and
looked
at
the
ground
and
looked
in
her
face
again
and
declared
he
could
never
guess
rokesmith
do
tell
me
so
my
dear
ter
roke
smith
pa
said
bella
separating
the
syllables
for
emphasis
do
you
say
to
that
pa
answered
quietly
with
the
did
you
say
to
that
my
love
said
no
returned
bella
sharply
course
of
course
said
her
father
meditating
i
told
him
why
i
thought
it
a
betrayal
of
trust
on
his
part
and
an
affront
to
me
said
bella
to
be
sure
i
am
astonished
indeed
i
wonder
he
committed
himself
without
seeing
more
of
his
way
first
now
i
think
of
it
i
suspect
he
always
has
admired
you
though
my
dear
hackney
coachman
may
admire
me
remarked
bella
with
a
touch
of
her
mother
loftiness
highly
probable
my
love
number
two
my
dear
two
pa
is
much
to
the
same
purpose
though
not
so
preposterous
mr
lightwood
would
propose
to
me
if
i
would
let
him
i
understand
my
dear
that
you
do
intend
to
let
him
bella
again
saying
with
her
former
emphasis
of
course
not
her
father
felt
himself
bound
to
echo
course
not
do
care
for
him
said
bella
enough
her
father
interposed
pa
it
not
enough
rejoined
bella
giving
him
another
shake
or
two
i
told
you
what
a
mercenary
little
wretch
i
am
it
only
becomes
enough
when
he
has
no
money
and
no
clients
and
no
expectations
and
no
anything
but
debts
said
the
cherub
a
little
depressed
three
my
dear
three
pa
is
a
better
thing
a
generous
thing
a
noble
thing
a
delightful
thing
mrs
boffin
has
herself
told
me
as
a
secret
with
her
own
kind
lips
and
truer
lips
never
opened
or
closed
in
this
life
i
am
sure
that
they
wish
to
see
me
well
married
and
that
when
i
marry
with
their
consent
they
will
portion
me
most
handsomely
here
the
grateful
girl
burst
out
crying
very
heartily
cry
my
darling
said
her
father
with
his
hand
to
his
eyes
excusable
in
me
to
be
a
little
overcome
when
i
find
that
my
dear
favourite
child
is
after
all
disappointments
to
be
so
provided
for
and
so
raised
in
the
world
but
do
you
cry
do
you
cry
i
am
very
thankful
i
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
my
dear
the
good
soft
little
fellow
drying
his
eyes
here
bella
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
tenderly
kissed
him
on
the
high
road
passionately
telling
him
he
was
the
best
of
fathers
and
the
best
of
friends
and
that
on
her
she
would
go
down
on
her
knees
to
him
and
beg
his
pardon
for
having
ever
teased
him
or
seemed
insensible
to
the
worth
of
such
a
patient
sympathetic
genial
fresh
young
heart
at
every
one
of
her
adjectives
she
redoubled
her
kisses
and
finally
kissed
his
hat
off
and
then
laughed
immoderately
when
the
wind
took
it
and
he
ran
after
it
when
he
had
recovered
his
hat
and
his
breath
and
they
were
going
on
again
once
more
said
her
father
then
four
my
dear
bella
countenance
fell
in
the
midst
of
her
mirth
all
perhaps
i
had
better
put
off
number
four
let
me
try
once
more
if
for
never
so
short
a
time
to
hope
that
it
may
not
really
be
so
the
change
in
her
strengthened
the
cherub
interest
in
number
four
and
he
said
quietly
not
be
so
my
dear
may
not
be
how
my
dear
bella
looked
at
him
pensively
and
shook
her
head
yet
i
know
right
well
it
is
so
pa
i
know
it
only
too
well
love
returned
her
father
make
me
quite
uncomfortable
have
you
said
no
to
anybody
else
my
dear
to
anybody
he
suggested
lifting
up
his
eyebrows
there
anybody
else
who
would
take
his
chance
between
yes
and
no
if
you
would
let
him
my
dear
that
i
know
of
ca
be
somebody
who
wo
take
his
chance
when
you
want
him
to
said
the
cherub
as
a
last
resource
of
course
not
pa
said
bella
giving
him
another
shake
or
two
of
course
not
he
assented
my
dear
i
am
afraid
i
must
either
have
no
sleep
or
i
must
press
for
number
four
pa
there
is
no
good
in
number
four
i
am
so
sorry
for
it
i
am
so
unwilling
to
believe
it
i
have
tried
so
earnestly
not
to
see
it
that
it
is
very
hard
to
tell
even
to
you
but
mr
boffin
is
being
spoilt
by
prosperity
and
is
changing
every
day
dear
bella
i
hope
and
trust
not
have
hoped
and
trusted
not
too
pa
but
every
day
he
changes
for
the
worse
and
for
the
worse
not
to
me
he
is
always
much
the
same
to
me
but
to
others
about
him
before
my
eyes
he
grows
suspicious
capricious
hard
tyrannical
unjust
if
ever
a
good
man
were
ruined
by
good
fortune
it
is
my
benefactor
and
yet
pa
think
how
terrible
the
fascination
of
money
is
i
see
this
and
hate
this
and
dread
this
and
do
know
but
that
money
might
make
a
much
worse
change
in
me
and
yet
i
have
money
always
in
my
thoughts
and
my
desires
and
the
whole
life
i
place
before
myself
is
money
money
money
and
what
money
can
make
of
life
chapter
the
golden
dustman
falls
into
bad
company
were
bella
wilfer
bright
and
ready
little
wits
at
fault
or
was
the
golden
dustman
passing
through
the
furnace
of
proof
and
coming
out
dross
ill
news
travels
fast
we
shall
know
full
soon
on
that
very
night
of
her
return
from
the
happy
return
something
chanced
which
bella
closely
followed
with
her
eyes
and
ears
there
was
an
apartment
at
the
side
of
the
boffin
mansion
known
as
mr
room
far
less
grand
than
the
rest
of
the
house
it
was
far
more
comfortable
being
pervaded
by
a
certain
air
of
homely
snugness
which
upholstering
despotism
had
banished
to
that
spot
when
it
inexorably
set
its
face
against
mr
boffin
appeals
for
mercy
in
behalf
of
any
other
chamber
thus
although
a
room
of
modest
situation
for
its
windows
gave
on
silas
wegg
old
corner
and
of
no
pretensions
to
velvet
satin
or
gilding
it
had
got
itself
established
in
a
domestic
position
analogous
to
that
of
an
easy
or
pair
of
slippers
and
whenever
the
family
wanted
to
enjoy
a
particularly
pleasant
fireside
evening
they
enjoyed
it
as
an
institution
that
must
be
in
mr
boffin
room
mr
and
mrs
boffin
were
reported
sitting
in
this
room
when
bella
got
back
entering
it
she
found
the
secretary
there
too
in
official
attendance
it
would
appear
for
he
was
standing
with
some
papers
in
his
hand
by
a
table
with
shaded
candles
on
it
at
which
mr
boffin
was
seated
thrown
back
in
his
easy
chair
are
busy
sir
said
bella
hesitating
at
the
door
at
all
my
dear
not
at
all
you
one
of
ourselves
we
never
make
company
of
you
come
in

in
here

lady
in
her
usual
place
mrs
boffin
adding
her
nod
and
smile
of
welcome
to
mr
boffin
words
bella
took
her
book
to
a
chair
in
the
fireside
corner
by
mrs
mr
boffin
station

on
the
opposite
side
rokesmith
said
the
golden
dustman
so
sharply
rapping
the
table
to
bespeak
his
attention
as
bella
turned
the
leaves
of
her
book
that
she
started
were
we
were
saying
sir
returned
the
secretary
with
an
air
of
some
reluctance
and
a
glance
towards
those
others
who
were
present
you
considered
the
time
had
come
for
fixing
my
salary

above
calling

said
mr
boffin
testily
the
deuce
i
never
talked
of
any
salary
when
i
was
in
service

said
the
secretary
correcting
himself
you
are
not
proud

observed
mr
boffin
eyeing
him
askance
hope
not
sir
i
never

mr
boffin
and
pride

go
at
all

that
how
can
they
go
well
together
why
it
stands
to
reason
a
man
being
poor
has
nothing
to
be
proud
of
it
nonsense
with
a
slight
inclination
of
his
head
and
a
look
of
some
surprise
the
secretary
seemed
to
assent
by
forming
the
syllables
of
the
word
on
his
lips
concerning
these
same
wages
said
mr
boffin
down
the
secretary
sat
down
did
you
sit
down
before
asked
mr
boffin
distrustfully
hope
that
was
pride
but
about
these
wages
now
i
gone
into
the
matter
and
i
say
two
hundred
a
year
what
do
you
think
of
it
do
you
think
it
enough
you
it
is
a
fair
proposal
do
say
you
know
mr
boffin
stipulated
what
it
may
be
more
than
enough
and
i
tell
you
why
rokesmith
a
man
of
property
like
me
is
bound
to
consider
the
at
first
i
did
enter
into
that
as
much
as
i
might
have
done
but
i
got
acquainted
with
other
men
of
property
since
and
i
got
acquainted
with
the
duties
of
property
i
must
go
putting
the
up
because
money
may
happen
not
to
be
an
object
with
me
a
sheep
is
worth
so
much
in
the
market
and
i
ought
to
give
it
and
no
more
a
secretary
is
worth
so
much
in
the
market
and
i
ought
to
give
it
and
no
more
however
i
do
mind
stretching
a
point
with
you
boffin
you
are
very
good
replied
the
secretary
with
an
effort
we
put
the
figure
said
mr
boffin
two
hundred
a
year
then
the
figure
disposed
of
now
there
must
be
no
misunderstanding
regarding
what
i
buy
for
two
hundred
a
year
if
i
pay
for
a
sheep
i
buy
it
out
and
out
similarly
if
i
pay
for
a
secretary
i
buy
him
out
and
out
other
words
you
purchase
my
whole
time
i
do
look
here
said
mr
boffin
ai
that
i
want
to
occupy
your
whole
time
you
can
take
up
a
book
for
a
minute
or
two
when
you
nothing
better
to
do
though
i
think
you
always
find
something
useful
to
do
but
i
want
to
keep
you
in
attendance
convenient
to
have
you
at
all
times
ready
on
the
premises
therefore
betwixt
your
breakfast
and
your
supper
on
the
premises
i
expect
to
find
you
the
secretary
bowed
bygone
days
when
i
was
in
service
myself
said
mr
boffin
could
go
cutting
about
at
my
will
and
pleasure
and
you
wo
expect
to
go
cutting
about
at
your
will
and
pleasure
you
rather
got
into
a
habit
of
that
lately
but
perhaps
it
was
for
want
of
a
right
specification
betwixt
us
now
let
there
be
a
right
specification
betwixt
us
and
let
it
be
this
if
you
want
leave
ask
for
it
again
the
secretary
bowed
his
manner
was
uneasy
and
astonished
and
showed
a
sense
of
humiliation
have
a
bell
said
mr
boffin
from
this
room
to
yours
and
when
i
want
you
i
touch
it
i
do
call
to
mind
that
i
have
anything
more
to
say
at
the
present
moment
the
secretary
rose
gathered
up
his
papers
and
withdrew
bella
eyes
followed
him
to
the
door
lighted
on
mr
boffin
complacently
thrown
back
in
his
easy
chair
and
drooped
over
her
book
have
let
that
chap
that
young
man
of
mine
said
mr
boffin
taking
a
trot
up
and
down
the
room
above
his
work
it
wo
do
i
must
have
him
down
a
peg
a
man
of
property
owes
a
duty
to
other
men
of
property
and
must
look
sharp
after
his
inferiors
bella
felt
that
mrs
boffin
was
not
comfortable
and
that
the
eyes
of
that
good
creature
sought
to
discover
from
her
face
what
attention
she
had
given
to
this
discourse
and
what
impression
it
had
made
upon
her
for
which
reason
bella
eyes
drooped
more
engrossedly
over
her
book
and
she
turned
the
page
with
an
air
of
profound
absorption
in
it
said
mrs
boffin
after
thoughtfully
pausing
in
her
work
dear
returned
the
golden
dustman
stopping
short
in
his
trot
my
putting
it
to
you
noddy
but
now
really
have
you
been
a
little
strict
with
mr
rokesmith
have
you
been
a
little
just
a
little
little
not
quite
like
your
old
self
old
woman
i
hope
so
returned
mr
boffin
cheerfully
if
not
boastfully
so
deary
old
selves
would
do
here
old
lady
have
you
found
that
out
yet
our
old
selves
would
be
fit
for
nothing
here
but
to
be
robbed
and
imposed
upon
our
old
selves
were
people
of
fortune
our
new
selves
are
it
a
great
difference
said
mrs
boffin
pausing
in
her
work
again
softly
to
draw
a
long
breath
and
to
look
at
the
fire
great
difference
we
must
be
up
to
the
difference
pursued
her
husband
must
be
equal
to
the
change
that
what
we
must
be
we
got
to
hold
our
own
now
against
everybody
for
everybody
hand
is
stretched
out
to
be
dipped
into
our
pockets
and
we
have
got
to
recollect
that
money
makes
money
as
well
as
makes
everything
else
recollecting
said
mrs
boffin
with
her
work
abandoned
her
eyes
upon
the
fire
and
her
chin
upon
her
hand
you
recollect
noddy
how
you
said
to
mr
rokesmith
when
he
first
came
to
see
us
at
the
bower
and
you
engaged
him
how
you
said
to
him
that
if
it
had
pleased
heaven
to
send
john
harmon
to
his
fortune
safe
we
could
have
been
content
with
the
one
mound
which
was
our
legacy
and
should
never
have
wanted
the
rest
i
remember
old
lady
but
we
had
tried
what
it
was
to
have
the
rest
then
our
new
shoes
had
come
home
but
we
had
put
on
wearing
now
we
wearing
and
must
step
out
accordingly
mrs
boffin
took
up
her
work
again
and
plied
her
needle
in
silence
to
rokesmith
that
young
man
of
mine
said
mr
boffin
dropping
his
voice
and
glancing
towards
the
door
with
an
apprehension
of
being
overheard
by
some
eavesdropper
there
the
same
with
him
as
with
the
footmen
i
have
found
out
that
you
must
either
scrunch
them
or
let
them
scrunch
you
if
you
ai
imperious
with
they
wo
believe
in
your
being
any
better
than
themselves
if
as
good
after
the
stories
lies
mostly
that
they
have
heard
of
your
beginnings
there
nothing
betwixt
stiffening
yourself
up
and
throwing
yourself
away
take
my
word
for
that
old
lady
bella
ventured
for
a
moment
to
look
stealthily
towards
him
under
her
eyelashes
and
she
saw
a
dark
cloud
of
suspicion
covetousness
and
conceit
overshadowing
the
once
open
face
said
he
is
entertaining
to
miss
bella
is
it
bella
a
deceiving
bella
she
was
to
look
at
him
with
that
pensively
abstracted
air
as
if
her
mind
were
full
of
her
book
and
she
had
not
heard
a
single
word
better
employed
than
to
attend
to
it
said
mr
boffin
right
that
right
especially
as
you
have
no
call
to
be
told
how
to
value
yourself
my
dear
colouring
a
little
under
this
compliment
bella
returned
hope
sir
you
do
think
me
vain
a
bit
my
dear
said
mr
boffin
i
think
it
very
creditable
in
you
at
your
age
to
be
so
well
up
with
the
pace
of
the
world
and
to
know
what
to
go
in
for
you
are
right
go
in
for
money
my
love
the
article
you
make
money
of
your
good
looks
and
of
the
money
mrs
boffin
and
me
will
have
the
pleasure
of
settling
upon
you
and
live
and
die
rich
that
the
state
to
live
and
die
in
said
mr
boffin
in
an
unctuous
manner
r
r
rich
there
was
an
expression
of
distress
in
mrs
boffin
face
as
after
watching
her
husband
she
turned
to
their
adopted
girl
and
said
mind
him
bella
my
dear
cried
mr
boffin
not
mind
him
do
mean
that
said
mrs
boffin
with
a
worried
look
i
mean
do
believe
him
to
be
anything
but
good
and
generous
bella
because
he
is
the
best
of
men
no
i
must
say
that
much
noddy
you
are
always
the
best
of
men
she
made
the
declaration
as
if
he
were
objecting
to
it
which
assuredly
he
was
not
in
any
way
as
to
you
my
dear
bella
said
mrs
boffin
still
with
that
distressed
expression
is
so
much
attached
to
you
whatever
he
says
that
your
own
father
has
not
a
truer
interest
in
you
and
can
hardly
like
you
better
than
he
does
too
cried
mr
boffin
he
says
why
i
say
so
openly
give
me
a
kiss
my
dear
child
in
saying
good
night
and
let
me
confirm
what
my
old
lady
tells
you
i
am
very
fond
of
you
my
dear
and
i
am
entirely
of
your
mind
and
you
and
i
will
take
care
that
you
shall
be
rich
these
good
looks
of
yours
which
you
have
some
right
to
be
vain
of
my
dear
though
you
are
not
you
know
are
worth
money
and
you
shall
make
money
of
the
money
you
will
have
will
be
worth
money
and
you
shall
make
money
of
that
too
there
a
golden
ball
at
your
feet
good
night
my
dear
somehow
bella
was
not
so
well
pleased
with
this
assurance
and
this
prospect
as
she
might
have
been
somehow
when
she
put
her
arms
round
mrs
boffin
neck
and
said
good
night
she
derived
a
sense
of
unworthiness
from
the
still
anxious
face
of
that
good
woman
and
her
obvious
wish
to
excuse
her
husband
what
need
to
excuse
him
thought
bella
sitting
down
in
her
own
room
he
said
was
very
sensible
i
am
sure
and
very
true
i
am
sure
it
is
only
what
i
often
say
to
myself
do
i
like
it
then
no
i
do
like
it
and
though
he
is
my
liberal
benefactor
i
disparage
him
for
it
then
pray
said
bella
sternly
putting
the
question
to
herself
in
the
as
usual
do
you
mean
by
this
you
inconsistent
little
beast
the
preserving
a
discreet
ministerial
silence
when
thus
called
upon
for
explanation
bella
went
to
bed
with
a
weariness
upon
her
spirit
which
was
more
than
the
weariness
of
want
of
sleep
and
again
in
the
morning
she
looked
for
the
cloud
and
for
the
deepening
of
the
cloud
upon
the
golden
dustman
face
she
had
begun
by
this
time
to
be
his
frequent
companion
in
his
morning
strolls
about
the
streets
and
it
was
at
this
time
that
he
made
her
a
party
to
his
engaging
in
a
curious
pursuit
having
been
hard
at
work
in
one
dull
enclosure
all
his
life
he
had
a
child
delight
in
looking
at
shops
it
had
been
one
of
the
first
novelties
and
pleasures
of
his
freedom
and
was
equally
the
delight
of
his
wife
for
many
years
their
only
walks
in
london
had
been
taken
on
sundays
when
the
shops
were
shut
and
when
every
day
in
the
week
became
their
holiday
they
derived
an
enjoyment
from
the
variety
and
fancy
and
beauty
of
the
display
in
the
windows
which
seemed
incapable
of
exhaustion
as
if
the
principal
streets
were
a
great
theatre
and
the
play
were
childishly
new
to
them
mr
and
mrs
boffin
from
the
beginning
of
bella
intimacy
in
their
house
had
been
constantly
in
the
front
row
charmed
with
all
they
saw
and
applauding
vigorously
but
now
mr
boffin
interest
began
to
centre
in
and
more
than
that
for
that
of
itself
would
not
have
been
much
in
one
exceptional
kind
of
book
in
here
my
dear
mr
boffin
would
say
checking
bella
arm
at
a
bookseller
window
can
read
at
sight
and
your
eyes
are
as
sharp
as
they
bright
now
look
well
about
you
my
dear
and
tell
me
if
you
see
any
book
about
a
miser
if
bella
saw
such
a
book
mr
boffin
would
instantly
dart
in
and
buy
it
and
still
as
if
they
had
not
found
it
they
would
seek
out
another
and
mr
boffin
would
say
look
well
all
round
my
dear
for
a
life
of
a
miser
or
any
book
of
that
sort
any
lives
of
odd
characters
who
may
have
been
misers
bella
thus
directed
would
examine
the
window
with
the
greatest
attention
while
mr
boffin
would
examine
her
face
the
moment
she
pointed
out
any
book
as
being
entitled
lives
of
eccentric
personages
anecdotes
of
strange
characters
records
of
remarkable
individuals
or
anything
to
that
purpose
mr
boffin
countenance
would
light
up
and
he
would
instantly
dart
in
and
buy
it
size
price
quality
were
of
no
account
any
book
that
seemed
to
promise
a
chance
of
miserly
biography
mr
boffin
purchased
without
a
moment
delay
and
carried
home
happening
to
be
informed
by
a
bookseller
that
a
portion
of
the
annual
register
was
devoted
to
mr
boffin
at
once
bought
a
whole
set
of
that
ingenious
compilation
and
began
to
carry
it
home
piecemeal
confiding
a
volume
to
bella
and
bearing
three
himself
the
completion
of
this
labour
occupied
them
about
a
fortnight
when
the
task
was
done
mr
boffin
with
his
appetite
for
misers
whetted
instead
of
satiated
began
to
look
out
again
it
very
soon
became
unnecessary
to
tell
bella
what
to
look
for
and
an
understanding
was
established
between
her
and
mr
boffin
that
she
was
always
to
look
for
lives
of
misers
morning
after
morning
they
roamed
about
the
town
together
pursuing
this
singular
research
miserly
literature
not
being
abundant
the
proportion
of
failures
to
successes
may
have
been
as
a
hundred
to
one
still
mr
boffin
never
wearied
remained
as
avaricious
for
misers
as
he
had
been
at
the
first
onset
it
was
curious
that
bella
never
saw
the
books
about
the
house
nor
did
she
ever
hear
from
mr
boffin
one
word
of
reference
to
their
contents
he
seemed
to
save
up
his
misers
as
they
had
saved
up
their
money
as
they
had
been
greedy
for
it
and
secret
about
it
and
had
hidden
it
so
he
was
greedy
for
them
and
secret
about
them
and
hid
them
but
beyond
all
doubt
it
was
to
be
noticed
and
was
by
bella
very
clearly
noticed
that
as
he
pursued
the
acquisition
of
those
dismal
records
with
the
ardour
of
don
quixote
for
his
books
of
chivalry
he
began
to
spend
his
money
with
a
more
sparing
hand
and
often
when
he
came
out
of
a
shop
with
some
new
account
of
one
of
those
wretched
lunatics
she
would
almost
shrink
from
the
sly
dry
chuckle
with
which
he
would
take
her
arm
again
and
trot
away
it
did
not
appear
that
mrs
boffin
knew
of
this
taste
he
made
no
allusion
to
it
except
in
the
morning
walks
when
he
and
bella
were
always
alone
and
bella
partly
under
the
impression
that
he
took
her
into
his
confidence
by
implication
and
partly
in
remembrance
of
mrs
boffin
anxious
face
that
night
held
the
same
reserve
while
these
occurrences
were
in
progress
mrs
lammle
made
the
discovery
that
bella
had
a
fascinating
influence
over
her
the
lammles
originally
presented
by
the
dear
veneerings
visited
the
boffins
on
all
grand
occasions
and
mrs
lammle
had
not
previously
found
this
out
but
now
the
knowledge
came
upon
her
all
at
once
it
was
a
most
extraordinary
thing
she
said
to
mrs
boffin
she
was
foolishly
susceptible
of
the
power
of
beauty
but
it
was
altogether
that
she
never
had
been
able
to
resist
a
natural
grace
of
manner
but
it
was
altogether
that
it
was
more
than
that
and
there
was
no
name
for
the
indescribable
extent
and
degree
to
which
she
was
captivated
by
this
charming
girl
this
charming
girl
having
the
words
repeated
to
her
by
mrs
boffin
who
was
proud
of
her
being
admired
and
would
have
done
anything
to
give
her
pleasure
naturally
recognized
in
mrs
lammle
a
woman
of
penetration
and
taste
responding
to
the
sentiments
by
being
very
gracious
to
mrs
lammle
she
gave
that
lady
the
means
of
so
improving
her
opportunity
as
that
the
captivation
became
reciprocal
though
always
wearing
an
appearance
of
greater
sobriety
on
bella
part
than
on
the
enthusiastic
sophronia
howbeit
they
were
so
much
together
that
for
a
time
the
boffin
chariot
held
mrs
lammle
oftener
than
mrs
boffin
a
preference
of
which
the
latter
worthy
soul
was
not
in
the
least
jealous
placidly
remarking
lammle
is
a
younger
companion
for
her
than
i
am
and
lor
she
more
fashionable
but
between
bella
wilfer
and
georgiana
podsnap
there
was
this
one
difference
among
many
others
that
bella
was
in
no
danger
of
being
captivated
by
alfred
she
distrusted
and
disliked
him
indeed
her
perception
was
so
quick
and
her
observation
so
sharp
that
after
all
she
mistrusted
his
wife
too
though
with
her
giddy
vanity
and
wilfulness
she
squeezed
the
mistrust
away
into
a
corner
of
her
mind
and
blocked
it
up
there
mrs
lammle
took
the
friendliest
interest
in
bella
making
a
good
match
mrs
lammle
said
in
a
sportive
way
she
really
must
show
her
beautiful
bella
what
kind
of
wealthy
creatures
she
and
alfred
had
on
hand
who
would
as
one
man
fall
at
her
feet
enslaved
fitting
occasion
made
mrs
lammle
accordingly
produced
the
most
passable
of
those
feverish
boastful
and
indefinably
loose
gentlemen
who
were
always
lounging
in
and
out
of
the
city
on
questions
of
the
bourse
and
greek
and
spanish
and
india
and
mexican
and
par
and
premium
and
discount
and
and
who
in
their
agreeable
manner
did
homage
to
bella
as
if
she
were
a
compound
of
fine
girl
horse
drag
and
remarkable
pipe
but
without
the
least
effect
though
even
mr
fledgeby
attractions
were
cast
into
the
scale
fear
bella
dear
said
mrs
lammle
one
day
in
the
chariot
you
will
be
very
hard
to
please
do
expect
to
be
pleased
dear
said
bella
with
a
languid
turn
of
her
eyes
my
love
returned
sophronia
shaking
her
head
and
smiling
her
best
smile
would
not
be
very
easy
to
find
a
man
worthy
of
your
attractions
question
is
not
a
man
my
dear
said
bella
coolly
an
establishment
love
returned
mrs
lammle
prudence
amazes
me
where
did
you
study
life
so
well
you
are
right
in
such
a
case
as
yours
the
object
is
a
fitting
establishment
you
could
not
descend
to
an
inadequate
one
from
mr
boffin
house
and
even
if
your
beauty
alone
could
not
command
it
it
is
to
be
assumed
that
mr
and
mrs
boffin
will
they
have
already
bella
interposed
have
they
really
a
little
vexed
by
a
suspicion
that
she
had
spoken
precipitately
and
withal
a
little
defiant
of
her
own
vexation
bella
determined
not
to
retreat
is
to
say
she
explained
have
told
me
they
mean
to
portion
me
as
their
adopted
child
if
you
mean
that
but
do
mention
it
it
replied
mrs
lammle
as
if
she
were
full
of
awakened
feeling
at
the
suggestion
of
such
an
impossibility
it
do
mind
telling
you
mrs
lammle
bella
began
again
love
say
sophronia
or
i
must
not
say
bella
with
a
little
short
petulant
bella
complied
sophronia
then
i
do
mind
telling
you
sophronia
that
i
am
convinced
i
have
no
heart
as
people
call
it
and
that
i
think
that
sort
of
thing
is
nonsense
girl
murmured
mrs
lammle
so
pursued
bella
to
seeking
to
please
myself
i
do
except
in
the
one
respect
i
have
mentioned
i
am
indifferent
otherwise
you
ca
help
pleasing
bella
said
mrs
lammle
rallying
her
with
an
arch
look
and
her
best
smile
ca
help
making
a
proud
and
an
admiring
husband
you
may
not
care
to
please
yourself
and
you
may
not
care
to
please
him
but
you
are
not
a
free
agent
as
to
pleasing
you
are
forced
to
do
that
in
spite
of
yourself
my
dear
so
it
may
be
a
question
whether
you
may
not
as
well
please
yourself
too
if
you
can
now
the
very
grossness
of
this
flattery
put
bella
upon
proving
that
she
actually
did
please
in
spite
of
herself
she
had
a
misgiving
that
she
was
doing
wrong
though
she
had
an
indistinct
foreshadowing
that
some
harm
might
come
of
it
thereafter
she
little
thought
what
consequences
it
would
really
bring
about
but
she
went
on
with
her
confidence
talk
of
pleasing
in
spite
of
one
self
dear
said
bella
have
had
enough
of
that
cried
mrs
lammle
i
already
corroborated
bella
mind
sophronia
we
will
not
speak
of
it
any
more
do
ask
me
about
it
this
plainly
meaning
do
ask
me
about
it
mrs
lammle
did
as
she
was
requested
me
bella
come
my
dear
what
provoking
burr
has
been
inconveniently
attracted
to
the
charming
skirts
and
with
difficulty
shaken
off
indeed
said
bella
no
burr
to
boast
of
but
do
ask
me
i
guess
would
never
guess
what
would
you
say
to
our
secretary
dear
the
hermit
secretary
who
creeps
up
and
down
the
back
stairs
and
is
never
seen
do
know
about
his
creeping
up
and
down
the
back
stairs
said
bella
rather
contemptuously
than
knowing
that
he
does
no
such
thing
and
as
to
his
never
being
seen
i
should
be
content
never
to
have
seen
him
though
he
is
quite
as
visible
as
you
are
but
i
pleased
him
for
my
sins
and
he
had
the
presumption
to
tell
me
so
man
never
made
a
declaration
to
you
my
dear
bella
you
sure
of
that
sophronia
said
bella
am
not
in
fact
i
am
sure
of
the
contrary
man
must
be
mad
said
mrs
lammle
with
a
kind
of
resignation
appeared
to
be
in
his
senses
returned
bella
tossing
her
head
he
had
plenty
to
say
for
himself
i
told
him
my
opinion
of
his
declaration
and
his
conduct
and
dismissed
him
of
course
this
has
all
been
very
inconvenient
to
me
and
very
disagreeable
it
has
remained
a
secret
however
that
word
reminds
me
to
observe
sophronia
that
i
have
glided
on
into
telling
you
the
secret
and
that
i
rely
upon
you
never
to
mention
it
it
repeated
mrs
lammle
with
her
former
feeling
it
this
time
sophronia
was
so
much
in
earnest
that
she
found
it
necessary
to
bend
forward
in
the
carriage
and
give
bella
a
kiss
a
judas
order
of
kiss
for
she
thought
while
she
yet
pressed
bella
hand
after
giving
it
your
own
showing
you
vain
heartless
girl
puffed
up
by
the
doting
folly
of
a
dustman
i
need
have
no
relenting
towards
you
if
my
husband
who
sends
me
here
should
form
any
schemes
for
making
you
a
victim
i
should
certainly
not
cross
him
again
in
those
very
same
moments
bella
was
thinking
am
i
always
at
war
with
myself
why
have
i
told
as
if
upon
compulsion
what
i
knew
all
along
i
ought
to
have
withheld
why
am
i
making
a
friend
of
this
woman
beside
me
in
spite
of
the
whispers
against
her
that
i
hear
in
my
heart
as
usual
there
was
no
answer
in
the
when
she
got
home
and
referred
these
questions
to
it
perhaps
if
she
had
consulted
some
better
oracle
the
result
might
have
been
more
satisfactory
but
she
did
not
and
all
things
consequent
marched
the
march
before
them
on
one
point
connected
with
the
watch
she
kept
on
mr
boffin
she
felt
very
inquisitive
and
that
was
the
question
whether
the
secretary
watched
him
too
and
followed
the
sure
and
steady
change
in
him
as
she
did
her
very
limited
intercourse
with
mr
rokesmith
rendered
this
hard
to
find
out
their
communication
now
at
no
time
extended
beyond
the
preservation
of
commonplace
appearances
before
mr
and
mrs
boffin
and
if
bella
and
the
secretary
were
ever
left
alone
together
by
any
chance
he
immediately
withdrew
she
consulted
his
face
when
she
could
do
so
covertly
as
she
worked
or
read
and
could
make
nothing
of
it
he
looked
subdued
but
he
had
acquired
a
strong
command
of
feature
and
whenever
mr
boffin
spoke
to
him
in
bella
presence
or
whatever
revelation
of
himself
mr
boffin
made
the
secretary
face
changed
no
more
than
a
wall
a
slightly
knitted
brow
that
expressed
nothing
but
an
almost
mechanical
attention
and
a
compression
of
the
mouth
that
might
have
been
a
guard
against
a
scornful
smile
these
she
saw
from
morning
to
night
from
day
to
day
from
week
to
week
monotonous
unvarying
set
as
in
a
piece
of
sculpture
the
worst
of
the
matter
was
that
it
thus
fell
out
insensibly
and
most
provokingly
as
bella
complained
to
herself
in
her
impetuous
little
manner
that
her
observation
of
mr
boffin
involved
a
continual
observation
of
mr
rokesmith
that
extract
a
look
from
him
it
be
possible
that
makes
no
impression
on
him
such
questions
bella
would
propose
to
herself
often
as
many
times
in
a
day
as
there
were
hours
in
it
impossible
to
know
always
the
same
fixed
face
he
be
so
base
as
to
sell
his
very
nature
for
two
hundred
a
year
bella
would
think
and
then
why
not
it
a
mere
question
of
price
with
others
besides
him
i
suppose
i
would
sell
mine
if
i
could
get
enough
for
it
and
so
she
would
come
round
again
to
the
war
with
herself
a
kind
of
illegibility
though
a
different
kind
stole
over
mr
boffin
face
its
old
simplicity
of
expression
got
masked
by
a
certain
craftiness
that
assimilated
even
his
to
itself
his
very
smile
was
cunning
as
if
he
had
been
studying
smiles
among
the
portraits
of
his
misers
saving
an
occasional
burst
of
impatience
or
coarse
assertion
of
his
mastery
his
remained
to
him
but
it
had
now
a
sordid
alloy
of
distrust
and
though
his
eyes
should
twinkle
and
all
his
face
should
laugh
he
would
sit
holding
himself
in
his
own
arms
as
if
he
had
an
inclination
to
hoard
himself
up
and
must
always
grudgingly
stand
on
the
defensive
what
with
taking
heed
of
these
two
faces
and
what
with
feeling
conscious
that
the
stealthy
occupation
must
set
some
mark
on
her
own
bella
soon
began
to
think
that
there
was
not
a
candid
or
a
natural
face
among
them
all
but
mrs
boffin
none
the
less
because
it
was
far
less
radiant
than
of
yore
faithfully
reflecting
in
its
anxiety
and
regret
every
line
of
change
in
the
golden
dustman
said
mr
boffin
one
evening
when
they
were
all
in
his
room
again
and
he
and
the
secretary
had
been
going
over
some
accounts
am
spending
too
much
money
or
leastways
you
are
spending
too
much
for
me
are
rich
sir
am
not
said
mr
boffin
the
sharpness
of
the
retort
was
next
to
telling
the
secretary
that
he
lied
but
it
brought
no
change
of
expression
into
the
set
face
tell
you
i
am
not
rich
repeated
mr
boffin
i
wo
have
it
are
not
rich
sir
repeated
the
secretary
in
measured
words
returned
mr
boffin
i
am
that
my
business
i
am
not
going
to
spend
at
this
rate
to
please
you
or
anybody
you
would
like
it
if
it
was
your
money
in
that
impossible
case
sir
i
your
tongue
said
mr
boffin
ought
to
like
it
in
any
case
there
i
did
mean
to
be
rude
but
you
put
me
out
so
and
after
all
i
master
i
did
intend
to
tell
you
to
hold
your
tongue
i
beg
your
pardon
do
hold
your
tongue
only
do
contradict
did
you
ever
come
across
the
life
of
mr
elwes
referring
to
his
favourite
subject
at
last
miser
people
called
him
a
miser
people
are
always
calling
other
people
something
did
you
ever
read
about
him
think
so
never
owned
to
being
rich
and
yet
he
might
have
bought
me
twice
over
did
you
ever
hear
of
daniel
dancer
miser
yes
was
a
good
said
mr
boffin
he
had
a
sister
worthy
of
him
they
never
called
themselves
rich
neither
if
they
had
called
themselves
rich
most
likely
they
would
have
been
so
lived
and
died
very
miserably
did
they
not
sir
i
do
know
that
they
did
said
mr
boffin
curtly
they
are
not
the
misers
i
mean
those
abject
wretches
call
names
rokesmith
said
mr
that
exemplary
brother
and
sister
lived
and
died
in
the
foulest
and
filthiest
degradation
pleased
themselves
said
mr
boffin
i
suppose
they
could
have
done
no
more
if
they
had
spent
their
money
but
however
i
going
to
fling
mine
away
keep
the
expenses
down
the
fact
is
you
enough
here
rokesmith
it
wants
constant
attention
in
the
littlest
things
some
of
us
will
be
dying
in
a
workhouse
next
the
persons
you
have
cited

remarked
the
secretary
they
would

i
remember

creditable

mr
boffin

in

to
think
it
said
mr
boffin
with
a
look
of
peculiar
shrewdness
honourably
independent
in
you
as
to
make
it
a
relief
to
your
mind
to
make
that
furniture
over
to
me

the
light
of
a
against
the
rent

secretary

mr
boffin

good
as

or
ten
shillings

week

to
your
income
i
wo
deduct
for
it
i
look
to
you
to
make
it
up
handsomely
by
keeping
the
expenses
down
now
if
you
show
a
light
i
come
to
your
and
dispose
of
a
letter
or
two
on
that
clear
generous
face
of
mrs
boffin
bella
had
seen
such
traces
of
a
pang
at
the
heart
while
this
dialogue
was
being
held
that
she
had
not
the
courage
to
turn
her
eyes
to
it
when
they
were
left
alone
feigning
to
be
intent
on
her
embroidery
she
sat
plying
her
needle
until
her
busy
hand
was
stopped
by
mrs
boffin
hand
being
lightly
laid
upon
it
yielding
to
the
touch
she
felt
her
hand
carried
to
the
good
lips
and
felt
a
tear
fall
on
it
my
loved
husband
said
mrs
boffin
is
hard
to
see
and
hear
but
my
dear
bella
believe
me
that
in
spite
of
all
the
change
in
him
he
is
the
best
of
men
he
came
back
at
the
moment
when
bella
had
taken
the
hand
comfortingly
between
her
own
said
he
mistrustfully
looking
in
at
the
door
she
telling
you
is
only
praising
you
sir
said
bella
me
you
are
sure
not
blaming
me
for
standing
on
my
own
defence
against
a
crew
of
plunderers
who
could
suck
me
dry
by
driblets
not
blaming
me
for
getting
a
little
hoard
together
he
came
up
to
them
and
his
wife
folded
her
hands
upon
his
shoulder
and
shook
her
head
as
she
laid
it
on
her
hands
there
there
urged
mr
boffin
not
unkindly
take
on
old
lady
i
ca
bear
to
see
you
so
my
dear
recollect
we
are
not
our
old
selves
recollect
we
must
scrunch
or
be
scrunched
recollect
we
must
hold
our
own
recollect
money
makes
money
do
you
be
uneasy
bella
my
child
do
you
be
doubtful
the
more
i
save
the
more
you
shall
have
bella
thought
it
was
well
for
his
wife
that
she
was
musing
with
her
affectionate
face
on
his
shoulder
for
there
was
a
cunning
light
in
his
eyes
as
he
said
all
this
which
seemed
to
cast
a
disagreeable
illumination
on
the
change
in
him
and
make
it
morally
uglier
chapter
the
golden
dustman
falls
into
worse
company
it
had
come
to
pass
that
mr
silas
wegg
now
rarely
attended
the
minion
of
fortune
and
the
worm
of
the
hour
at
his
the
worm
and
minion
own
house
but
lay
under
general
instructions
to
await
him
within
a
certain
margin
of
hours
at
the
bower
mr
wegg
took
this
arrangement
in
great
dudgeon
because
the
appointed
hours
were
evening
hours
and
those
he
considered
precious
to
the
progress
of
the
friendly
move
but
it
was
quite
in
character
he
bitterly
remarked
to
mr
venus
that
the
upstart
who
had
trampled
on
those
eminent
creatures
miss
elizabeth
master
george
aunt
jane
and
uncle
parker
should
oppress
his
literary
man
the
roman
empire
having
worked
out
its
destruction
mr
boffin
next
appeared
in
a
cab
with
rollin
ancient
history
which
valuable
work
being
found
to
possess
lethargic
properties
broke
down
at
about
the
period
when
the
whole
of
the
army
of
alexander
the
macedonian
at
that
time
about
forty
thousand
strong
burst
into
tears
simultaneously
on
his
being
taken
with
a
shivering
fit
after
bathing
the
wars
of
the
jews
likewise
languishing
under
mr
wegg
generalship
mr
boffin
arrived
in
another
cab
with
plutarch
whose
lives
he
found
in
the
sequel
extremely
entertaining
though
he
hoped
plutarch
might
not
expect
him
to
believe
them
all
what
to
believe
in
the
course
of
his
reading
was
mr
boffin
chief
literary
difficulty
indeed
for
some
time
he
was
divided
in
his
mind
between
half
all
or
none
at
length
when
he
decided
as
a
moderate
man
to
compound
with
half
the
question
still
remained
which
half
and
that
he
never
got
over
one
evening
when
silas
wegg
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
arrival
of
his
patron
in
a
cab
accompanied
by
some
profane
historian
charged
with
unutterable
names
of
incomprehensible
peoples
of
impossible
descent
waging
wars
any
number
of
years
and
syllables
long
and
carrying
illimitable
hosts
and
riches
about
with
the
greatest
ease
beyond
the
confines
of
geography
one
evening
the
usual
time
passed
by
and
no
patron
appeared
after
half
an
hour
grace
mr
wegg
proceeded
to
the
outer
gate
and
there
executed
a
whistle
conveying
to
mr
venus
if
perchance
within
hearing
the
tidings
of
his
being
at
home
and
disengaged
forth
from
the
shelter
of
a
neighbouring
wall
mr
venus
then
emerged
in
arms
said
mr
wegg
in
excellent
spirits
in
return
mr
venus
gave
him
a
rather
dry
good
evening
in
brother
said
silas
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
take
your
seat
in
my
chimley
corner
for
what
says
the
ballad
no
malice
to
dread
sir
and
no
falsehood
to
fear
but
truth
to
delight
me
mr
venus
and
i
forgot
what
to
cheer
li
toddle
de
om

and
something
to
guide
my
ain
fireside
sir
my
ain
with
this
quotation
depending
for
its
neatness
rather
on
the
spirit
than
the
words
mr
wegg
conducted
his
guest
to
his
hearth
you
come
brother
said
mr
wegg
in
a
hospitable
glow
come
like
i
do
know
what
exactly

it
i
should
know
you
from
it
shedding
a
halo
all
around
you
kind
of
halo
asked
mr
venus
sir
replied
silas
your
halo
mr
venus
appeared
doubtful
on
the
point
and
looked
rather
discontentedly
at
the
fire
devote
the
evening
brother
exclaimed
wegg
prosecute
our
friendly
move
and
arterwards
crushing
a
flowing
which
i
allude
to
brewing
rum
and
water
we
pledge
one
another
for
what
says
the
poet
and
you
need
mr
venus
be
your
black
bottle
for
surely
i
be
mine
and
we
take
a
glass
with
a
slice
of
lemon
in
it
to
which
you
partial
for
auld
lang
this
flow
of
quotation
and
hospitality
in
wegg
indicated
his
observation
of
some
little
querulousness
on
the
part
of
venus
as
to
the
friendly
move
observed
the
gentleman
rubbing
his
knees
peevishly
of
my
objections
to
it
is
that

my
human
warious
for

afford
to

my

how
little
time
you

given
to

sir
after
all
urged

the
evenings
so
occupied
together

what

come
to

you

in
opinions

you
with
the
patience
to
fit
together
on

the
whole
framework
of
society
i
allude
to
the
human
skelinton
you
to
give
in
so
soon
do
like
it
returned
mr
venus
moodily
as
he
put
his
head
between
his
knees
and
stuck
up
his
dusty
hair
there
no
encouragement
to
go
on

mr

extending
his
right
hand
with
an
air
of
solemn
reasoning
not
them
mounds
now
looking
down
upon
us
too
big
grumbled
venus
a
scratch
here
and
a
scrape
there
a
poke
in
this
place
and
a
dig
in
the
other
to
them
besides
what

delighted
to
be
able

you
comrade
nothing
but
on
the
contrary
comrade
what
may
we
find
there
you
grant
me
anything

like
it
pettishly
returned
venus
as
before
came
into
it
without
enough
consideration
and
besides
again
is
your
own
mr
boffin
well
acquainted
with
the
mounds
and
was
he
well
acquainted
with
the
deceased
and
his
ways
and
has
he
ever
showed
any
expectation
of
finding
anything
at
that
moment
wheels
were
heard
i
should
be
loth
said
mr
wegg
with
an
air
of
patient
injury
think
so
ill
of
him
as
to
suppose
him
capable
of
coming
at
this
time
of
night
and
yet
it
sounds
like
him
a
ring
at
the
yard
bell
is
him
said
mr
wegg
he
is
capable
of
it
i
am
sorry
because
i
could
have
wished
to
keep
up
a
little
lingering
fragment
of
respect
for
him
here
mr
boffin
was
heard
lustily
calling
at
the
yard

cheerful
alacrity

a
light
and
there
through

against

not
ceasing
to
talk
and
bustle
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
mr
boffin
directed
the
removal
and
arrangement
of
the
books
appearing
to
be
in
some
sort
beside
himself
until
they
were
all
deposited
on
the
floor
and
the
cab
was
dismissed
said
mr
boffin
gloating
over

piercing
eagerness

returned
venus
he
showed

he
mr

with
a
glance
at

the
affirmative

mr

mr

shook
his
head
you

mr
venus
again
shook
his
head
if
he
had
ever
showed
you
a
teapot
i
should
be
glad
to
know
of
it
said
mr
boffin
and
then
with
his
right
hand
at
his
lips
repeated
thoughtfully
teapot
a
teapot
and
glanced
over
the
books
on
the
floor
as
if
he
knew
there
was
something
interesting
connected
with
a
teapot
somewhere
among
them
mr
wegg
and
mr
venus
looked
at
one
another
wonderingly
and
mr
wegg
in
fitting
on
his
spectacles
opened
his
eyes
wide
over
their
rims
and
tapped
the
side
of
his
nose
as
an
admonition
to
venus
to
keep
himself
generally
wide
awake

mr
boffin
continuing
to

and
survey
the

that
gentleman
taking
his
usual
seat
on

and
poking
his
wooden
leg
under
the
table
before

venus
would
you
make

mr

wegg
with
that
producing
a

handed
it
with
great
care
to
the
literary

inquired

adjusting
his

you

through
mr

with

warming
his

sitting
upon

down
to
the
consolatory
incident
of
his
dying

in

after

he
read

rather

his

and
the
room
in
which
they
sat
which
had
not
been
repaired
for
a
long
time
but
though
poor
in
external
structure
the
ruinous
fabric
was
very
rich
in
the
interior
it
took
many
weeks
to
explore
its
whole
contents
and
captain
holmes
found
it
a
very
agreeable
task
to
dive
into
the
miser
secret
here
mr
wegg
repeated
hoards
and
pegged
his
comrade
again
one

mr

found
to
be
a

in

short
of

contained
in

in
an
old

carefully
tied

strongly
nailed
down
to

were

started
forward
under

elevated
itself
as
he
read
on
several
bowls
were
discovered
filled
with
guineas
and
and
at
different
times
on
searching
the
corners
of
the
house
they
found
various
parcels
of
bank
notes
some
were
crammed
into
the
crevices
of
the
wall
here
mr
venus
looked
at
the
wall
bundles
were
hid
under
the
cushions
and
covers
of
the
chairs
here
mr

looked
under
himself
on
the
settle
some
were
reposing
snugly
at
the
back
of
the
drawers
and
notes
amounting
to
six
hundred
pounds
were
found
neatly
doubled
up
in
the
inside
of
an
old
teapot
in
the
stable
the
captain
found
jugs
full
of
old
dollars
and
shillings
the
chimney
was
not
left
unsearched
and
paid
very
well
for
the
trouble
for
in
nineteen
different
holes
all
filled
with
soot
were
found
various
sums
of
money
amounting
together
to
more
than
two
hundred
on
the
way
to
this
crisis
mr
wegg
wooden
leg
had
gradually
elevated
itself
more
and
more
and
he
had
nudged
mr
venus
with
his
opposite
elbow
deeper
and
deeper
until
at
length
the
preservation
of
his
balance
became
incompatible
with
the
two
actions
and
he
now
dropped
over
sideways
upon
that
gentleman
squeezing
him
against
the
settle
edge
nor
did
either
of
the
two
for
some
few
seconds
make
any
effort
to
recover
himself
both
remaining
in
a
kind
of
pecuniary
swoon
but
the
sight
of
mr
boffin
sitting
in
the
hugging
himself
with
his
eyes
upon
the
fire
acted
as
a
restorative
counterfeiting
a

to
cover
their
movements
mr
wegg
with
a
spasmodic
pulled
himself
and
mr
venus
up
in
a
masterly
manner
have
some
more
said
mr
boffin
hungrily
elwes
is
the
next
sir
is
it
your
pleasure
to
take
john
elwes
said
mr
boffin
hear
what
john
did
he
did
not
appear
to
have
hidden
anything
so
went
off
rather
flatly
but
an
exemplary
lady
named
wilcocks
who
had
stowed
away
gold
and
silver
in
a
in
a
a
of
treasure
in
a
hole
under
her
stairs
and
a
quantity
of
money
in
an
old
revived
the
interest
to
her
succeeded
another
lady
claiming
to
be
a
pauper
whose
wealth
was
found
wrapped
up
in
little
scraps
of
paper
and
old
rag
to
her
another
lady
by
trade
who
had
saved
a
fortune
of
ten
thousand
pounds
and
hidden
it
and
there
in
cracks
and
corners
behind
bricks
and
under
the
flooring
to
her
a
french
gentleman
who
had
crammed
up
his
chimney
rather
to
the
detriment
of
its
drawing
powers
leather
valise
containing
twenty
thousand
francs
gold
coins
and
a
large
quantity
of
precious
stones
as
discovered
by
a
chimneysweep
after
his
death
by
these
steps
mr
wegg
arrived
at
a
concluding
instance
of
the
human
magpie
years
ago
there
lived
at
cambridge
a
miserly
old
couple
of
the
name
of
jardine
they
had
two
sons
the
father
was
a
perfect
miser
and
at
his
death
one
thousand
guineas
were
discovered
secreted
in
his
bed
the
two
sons
grew
up
as
parsimonious
as
their
sire
when
about
twenty
years
of
age
they
commenced
business
at
cambridge
as
drapers
and
they
continued
there
until
their
death
the
establishment
of
the
messrs
jardine
was
the
most
dirty
of
all
the
shops
in
cambridge
customers
seldom
went
in
to
purchase
except
perhaps
out
of
curiosity
the
brothers
were
most
beings
for
although
surrounded
with
gay
apparel
as
their
staple
in
trade
they
wore
the
most
filthy
rags
themselves
it
is
said
that
they
had
no
bed
and
to
save
the
expense
of
one
always
slept
on
a
bundle
of
under
the
counter
in
their
housekeeping
they
were
penurious
in
the
extreme
a
joint
of
meat
did
not
grace
their
board
for
twenty
years
yet
when
the
first
of
the
brothers
died
the
other
much
to
his
surprise
found
large
sums
of
money
which
had
been
secreted
even
from
him
cried
mr
boffin
from
him
you
see
there
was
only
two
of
and
yet
one
of
hid
from
the
other
mr
venus
who
since
his
introduction
to
the
french
gentleman
had
been
stooping
to
peer
up
the
chimney
had
his
attention
recalled
by
the
last
sentence
and
took
the
liberty
of
repeating
it
you
like
it
asked
mr
boffin
turning
suddenly
beg
your
pardon
sir
you
like
what
wegg
been
mr
venus
answered
that
he
found
it
extremely
interesting

mr
boffin

some
more
come
when
you
like
come
the
day
after
half
an
hour
sooner
there

more
there
no
end
to
it
mr
venus
expressed
his
acknowledgments
and
accepted
the
invitation
wonderful
what
been
hid
at
one
time
and
another
said
mr
boffin
ruminating
wonderful
sir
observed
wegg
with
a
propitiatory
face
to
draw
him
out
and
with
another
peg
at
his
friend
and
brother
the
way
of
money
said
mr
boffin
and
papers
mr
wegg
in
a
languid
transport
again
dropped
over
on
mr
venus
and
again
recovering
himself
masked
his
emotions
with
a
sneeze
did
you
say
papers
too
sir

hidden
sir
and
forgot
said
mr
boffin
the
bookseller
that
sold
me
the
wonderful
museum
where
the
wonderful
museum
he
was
on
his
knees
on
the
floor
in
a
moment
groping
eagerly
among
the
books
i
assist
you
sir
asked
wegg
i
have
got
it

it
is
said
mr
boffin
dusting
it
with
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
four
i
know
it
was
the
fourth
wollume
that
the
bookseller
read
it
to

silas
took
the
book
and
turned
the
leaves

sir
that
not
it
said
mr
boffin
ca
have
been
a
petrefaction
of
general
john
reid
commonly
called
the
walking
rushlight
sir
with
portrait
nor
yet
him
said
mr
boffin
case
of
a
person
who
swallowed
a
sir
hide
it
asked
mr
boffin
no
sir
replied
wegg
consulting
the
text
appears
to
have
been
done
by
accident
oh
this
next
must
be
it
singular
discovery
of
a
will
lost
it
cried
mr
boffin
that
a
most
extraordinary
case
read
silas
wegg
aloud
was
tried
at
the
last
maryborough
assizes
in
ireland
it
was
briefly
this
robert
baldwin
in
march
made
his
will
in
which
he
devised
the
lands
now
in
question
to
the
children
of
his
youngest
son
soon
after
which
his
faculties
failed
him
and
he
became
altogether
childish
and
died
above
eighty
years
old
the
defendant
the
eldest
son
immediately
afterwards
gave
out
that
his
father
had
destroyed
the
will
and
no
will
being
found
he
entered
into
possession
of
the
lands
in
question
and
so
matters
remained
for
years
the
whole
family
during
all
that
time
believing
that
the
father
had
died
without
a
will
but
after
years
the
defendant
wife
died
and
he
very
soon
afterwards
at
the
age
of
married
a
very
young
woman
which
caused
some
anxiety
to
his
two
sons
whose
poignant
expressions
of
this
feeling
so
exasperated
their
father
that
he
in
his
resentment
executed
a
will
to
disinherit
his
eldest
son
and
in
his
fit
of
anger
showed
it
to
his
second
son
who
instantly
determined
to
get
at
it
and
destroy
it
in
order
to
preserve
the
property
to
his
brother
with
this
view
he
broke
open
his
father
desk
where
he
found
not
his
father
will
which
he
sought
after
but
the
will
of
his
grandfather
which
was
then
altogether
forgotten
in
the
said
mr
boffin
what
men
put
away
and
forget
or
mean
to
destroy
and
do
he
then
added
in
a
slow
tone
ton
ish
ing
and
as
he
rolled
his
eyes
all
round
the
room
wegg
and
venus
likewise
rolled
their
eyes
all
round
the
room
and
then
wegg
singly
fixed
his
eyes
on
mr
boffin
looking
at
the
fire
again
as
if
he
had
a
mind
to
spring
upon
him
and
demand
his
thoughts
or
his
life
time
up
for
said
mr
boffin
waving
his
hand
after
a
silence
the
day
after
range
the
books
upon
the
shelves
wegg
i
dare
say
mr
venus
will
be
so
kind
as
help
you
while
speaking
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
breast
of
his
outer
coat
and
struggled
with
some
object
there
that
was
too
large
to
be
got
out
easily
what
was
the
stupefaction
of
the
friendly
movers
when
this
object
at
last
emerging
proved
to
be
a
dark
lantern
without
at
all
noticing
the
effect
produced
by
this
little
instrument
mr
boffin
stood
it
on
his
knee
and
producing
a
box
of
matches
deliberately
lighted
the
candle
in
the
lantern
blew
out
the
kindled
match
and
cast
the
end
into
the
fire
going
wegg
he
then
announced
take
a
turn
about
the
place
and
round
the
yard
i
want
you
me
and
this
same
lantern
have
taken
hundreds
thousands
of
such
turns
in
our
time
together
i
could
think
sir
not
on
any
account
i
could
wegg
was
politely
beginning
when
mr
boffin
who
had
risen
and
was
going
towards
the
door
stopped
have
told
you
that
i
do
want
you
wegg
wegg
looked
intelligently
thoughtful
as
if
that
had
not
occurred
to
his
mind
until
he
now
brought
it
to
bear
on
the
circumstance
he
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
let
mr
boffin
go
out
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
but
the
instant
he
was
on
the
other
side
of
it
wegg
clutched
venus
with
both
hands
and
said
in
a
choking
whisper
as
if
he
were
being
strangled
venus
he
must
be
followed
he
must
be
watched
he
must
be
lost
sight
of
for
a
moment
must
he
asked
venus
also
strangling
you
might
have
noticed
i
was
a
little
elewated
in
spirits
when
you
come
in
i
found
something
have
you
found
asked
venus
clutching
him
with
both
hands
so
that
they
stood
interlocked
like
a
couple
of
preposterous
gladiators
no
time
to
tell
you
now
i
think
he
must
have
gone
to
look
for
it
we
must
have
an
eye
upon
him
instantly
releasing
each
other
they
crept
to
the
door
opened
it
softly
and
peeped
out
it
was
a
cloudy
night
and
the
black
shadow
of
the
mounds
made
the
dark
yard
darker
not
a
double
swindler
whispered
wegg
a
dark
lantern
we
could
have
seen
what
he
was
about
if
he
had
carried
a
light
one
softly
this
way
cautiously
along
the
path
that
was
bordered
by
fragments
of
crockery
set
in
ashes
the
two
stole
after
him
they
could
hear
him
at
his
peculiar
trot
crushing
the
loose
cinders
as
he
went
knows
the
place
by
heart
muttered
silas
do
need
to
turn
his
lantern
on
confound
him
but
he
did
turn
it
on
almost
in
that
same
instant
and
flashed
its
light
upon
the
first
of
the
mounds
that
the
spot
asked
venus
in
a
whisper
warm
said
silas
in
the
same
tone
precious
warm
close
i
think
he
must
be
going
to
look
for
it
what
that
he
got
in
his
hand
shovel
answered
venus
he
knows
how
to
use
it
remember
fifty
times
as
well
as
either
of
us
he
looks
for
it
and
misses
it
partner
suggested
wegg
shall
we
do
of
all
wait
till
he
does
said
venus
discreet
advice
too
for
he
darkened
his
lantern
again
and
the
mound
turned
black
after
a
few
seconds
he
turned
the
light
on
once
more
and
was
seen
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
second
mound
slowly
raising
the
lantern
little
by
little
until
he
held
it
up
at
arm
length
as
if
he
were
examining
the
condition
of
the
whole
surface
ca
be
the
spot
too
said
venus
said
wegg
getting
cold
strikes
me
whispered
venus
he
wants
to
find
out
whether
any
one
has
been
groping
about
there
returned
wegg
getting
colder
and
now
freezing
this
exclamation
was
elicited
by
his
having
turned
the
lantern
off
again
and
on
again
and
being
visible
at
the
foot
of
the
third
mound
he
going
up
it
said
venus
and
all
said
wegg
at
a
nimbler
trot
as
if
the
shovel
over
his
shoulder
stimulated
him
by
reviving
old
associations
mr
boffin
ascended
the
walk
up
the
mound
which
he
had
described
to
silas
wegg
on
the
occasion
of
their
beginning
to
decline
and
fall
on
striking
into
it
he
turned
his
lantern
off
the
two
followed
him
stooping
low
so
that
their
figures
might
make
no
mark
in
relief
against
the
sky
when
he
should
turn
his
lantern
on
again
mr
venus
took
the
lead
towing
mr
wegg
in
order
that
his
refractory
leg
might
be
promptly
extricated
from
any
pitfalls
it
should
dig
for
itself
they
could
just
make
out
that
the
golden
dustman
stopped
to
breathe
of
course
they
stopped
too
instantly
is
his
own
mound
whispered
wegg
as
he
recovered
his
wind
one
all
three
are
his
own
returned
venus
he
thinks
but
he
used
to
call
this
his
own
because
it
the
one
first
left
to
him
the
one
that
was
his
legacy
when
it
was
all
he
took
under
the
will
he
shows
his
light
said
venus
keeping
watch
upon
his
dusky
figure
all
the
time
lower
and
keep
closer
he
went
on
again
and
they
followed
again
gaining
the
top
of
the
mound
he
turned
on
his
light
but
only
partially
and
stood
it
on
the
ground
a
bare
lopsided
weatherbeaten
pole
was
planted
in
the
ashes
there
and
had
been
there
many
a
year
hard
by
this
pole
his
lantern
stood
lighting
a
few
feet
of
the
lower
part
of
it
and
a
little
of
the
ashy
surface
around
and
then
casting
off
a
purposeless
little
clear
trail
of
light
into
the
air
can
never
be
going
to
dig
up
the
pole
whispered
venus
as
they
dropped
low
and
kept
close
it
holler
and
full
of
something
whispered
wegg
he
was
going
to
dig
with
whatsoever
object
for
he
tucked
up
his
cuffs
and
spat
on
his
hands
and
then
went
at
it
like
an
old
digger
as
he
was
he
had
no
design
upon
the
pole
except
that
he
measured
a
length
from
it
before
beginning
nor
was
it
his
purpose
to
dig
deep
some
dozen
or
so
of
expert
strokes
sufficed
then
he
stopped
looked
down
into
the
cavity
bent
over
it
and
took
out
what
appeared
to
be
an
ordinary
one
of
those
squat
glass
bottles
which
the
dutchman
is
said
to
keep
his
courage
in
as
soon
as
he
had
done
this
he
turned
off
his
lantern
and
they
could
hear
that
he
was
filling
up
the
hole
in
the
dark
the
ashes
being
easily
moved
by
a
skilful
hand
the
spies
took
this
as
a
hint
to
make
off
in
good
time
accordingly
mr
venus
slipped
past
mr
wegg
and
towed
him
down
but
mr
wegg
descent
was
not
accomplished
without
some
personal
inconvenience
for
his
leg
sticking
into
the
ashes
about
half
way
down
and
time
pressing
mr
venus
took
the
liberty
of
hauling
him
from
his
tether
by
the
collar
which
occasioned
him
to
make
the
rest
of
the
journey
on
his
back
with
his
head
enveloped
in
the
skirts
of
his
coat
and
his
wooden
leg
coming
last
like
a
drag
so
flustered
was
mr
wegg
by
this
mode
of
travelling
that
when
he
was
set
on
the
level
ground
with
his
intellectual
developments
uppermost
he
was
quite
unconscious
of
his
bearings
and
had
not
the
least
idea
where
his
place
of
residence
was
to
be
found
until
mr
venus
shoved
him
into
it
even
then
he
staggered
round
and
round
weakly
staring
about
him
until
mr
venus
with
a
hard
brush
brushed
his
senses
into
him
and
the
dust
out
of
him
mr
boffin
came
down
leisurely
for
this
brushing
process
had
been
well
accomplished
and
mr
venus
had
had
time
to
take
his
breath
before
he
reappeared
that
he
had
the
bottle
somewhere
about
him
could
not
be
doubted
where
was
not
so
clear
he
wore
a
large
rough
coat
buttoned
over
and
it
might
be
in
any
one
of
half
a
dozen
pockets
the
matter
wegg
said
mr
boffin
are
as
pale
as
a
candle
mr
wegg
replied
with
literal
exactness
that
he
felt
as
if
he
had
had
a
turn
said
mr
boffin
blowing
out
the
light
in
the
lantern
shutting
it
up
and
stowing
it
away
in
the
breast
of
his
coat
as
before
you
subject
to
bile
wegg
mr
wegg
again
replied
with
strict
adherence
to
truth
that
he
think
he
had
ever
had
a
similar
sensation
in
his
head
to
anything
like
the
same
extent
yourself
wegg
said
mr
boffin
be
in
order
for
next
night
this
neighbourhood
is
going
to
have
a
loss
wegg
loss
sir
to
lose
the
mounds
the
friendly
movers
made
such
an
obvious
effort
not
to
look
at
one
another
that
they
might
as
well
have
stared
at
one
another
with
all
their
might
you
parted
with
them
mr
boffin
asked
silas
they
going
mine
as
good
as
gone
already
mean
the
little
one
of
the
three
with
the
pole
atop
sir
said
mr
boffin
rubbing
his
ear
in
his
old
way
with
that
new
touch
of
craftiness
added
to
it
has
fetched
a
penny
it
begin
to
be
carted
off
you
been
out
to
take
leave
of
your
old
friend
sir
asked
silas
jocosely
said
mr
boffin
the
devil
put
that
in
your
head
he
was
so
sudden
and
rough
that
wegg
who
had
been
hovering
closer
and
closer
to
his
skirts
despatching
the
back
of
his
hand
on
exploring
expeditions
in
search
of
the
bottle
surface
retired
two
or
three
paces
offence
sir
said
wegg
humbly
offence
mr
boffin
eyed
him
as
a
dog
might
eye
another
dog
who
wanted
his
bone
and
actually
retorted
with
a
low
growl
as
the
dog
might
have
retorted
he
said
after
having
sunk
into
a
moody
silence
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
and
his
eyes
suspiciously
wandering
about
stop
there
i
know
the
way
out
and
i
want
no
light
avarice
and
the
evening
legends
of
avarice
and
the
inflammatory
effect
of
what
he
had
seen
and
perhaps
the
rush
of
his
blood
to
his
brain
in
his
descent
wrought
silas
wegg
to
such
a
pitch
of
insatiable
appetite
that
when
the
door
closed
he
made
a
swoop
at
it
and
drew
venus
along
with
him
must
go
he
cried
must
let
him
go
he
has
got
that
bottle
about
him
we
must
have
that
bottle
you
would
take
it
by
force
said
venus
restraining
him
i
yes
i
would
i
take
it
by
any
force
i
have
it
at
any
price
are
you
so
afraid
of
one
old
man
as
to
let
him
go
you
coward
am
so
afraid
of
you
as
not
to
let
you
go
muttered
venus
sturdily
clasping
him
in
his
arms
you
hear
him
retorted
wegg
you
hear
him
say
that
he
was
resolved
to
disappoint
us
did
you
hear
him
say
you
cur
that
he
was
going
to
have
the
mounds
cleared
off
when
no
doubt
the
whole
place
will
be
rummaged
if
you
have
the
spirit
of
a
mouse
to
defend
your
rights
i
have
let
me
go
after
him
as
in
his
wildness
he
was
making
a
strong
struggle
for
it
mr
venus
deemed
it
expedient
to
lift
him
throw
him
and
fall
with
him
well
knowing
that
once
down
he
would
not
be
up
again
easily
with
his
wooden
leg
so
they
both
rolled
on
the
floor
and
as
they
did
so
mr
boffin
shut
the
gate
chapter
the
friendly
move
takes
up
a
strong
position
the
friendly
movers
sat
upright
on
the
floor
panting
and
eyeing
one
another
after
mr
boffin
had
slammed
the
gate
and
gone
away
in
the
weak
eyes
of
venus
and
in
every
reddish
hair
in
his
shock
of
hair
there
was
a
marked
distrust
of
wegg
and
an
alertness
to
fly
at
him
on
perceiving
the
smallest
occasion
in
the
face
of
wegg
and
in
his
stiff
knotty
figure
he
looked
like
a
german
wooden
toy
there
was
expressed
a
politic
conciliation
which
had
no
spontaneity
in
it
both
were
flushed
flustered
and
rumpled
by
the
late
scuffle
and
wegg
in
coming
to
the
ground
had
received
a
humming
knock
on
the
back
of
his
devoted
head
which
caused
him
still
to
rub
it
with
an
air
of
having
been
highly
but
disagreeably
astonished
each
was
silent
for
some
time
leaving
it
to
the
other
to
begin
said
wegg
at
length
breaking
the
silence
were
right
and
i
was
wrong
i
forgot
myself
mr
venus
knowingly
cocked
his
shock
of
hair
as
rather
thinking
mr
wegg
had
remembered
himself
in
respect
of
appearing
without
any
disguise
comrade
pursued
wegg
was
never
your
lot
to
know
miss
elizabeth
master
george
aunt
jane
nor
uncle
parker
mr
venus
admitted
that
he
had
never
known
those
distinguished
persons
and
added
in
effect
that
he
had
never
so
much
as
desired
the
honour
of
their
acquaintance
say
that
comrade
retorted
wegg
do
say
that
because
without
having
known
them
you
never
can
fully
know
what
it
is
to
be
stimilated
to
frenzy
by
the
sight
of
the
usurper
offering
these
excusatory
words
as
if
they
reflected
great
credit
on
himself
mr
wegg
impelled
himself
with
his
hands
towards
a
chair
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
there
after
a
variety
of
awkward
gambols
attained
a
perpendicular
position
mr
venus
also
rose
said
wegg
a
seat
comrade
what
a
speaking
countenance
is
yours
mr
venus
involuntarily
smoothed
his
countenance
and
looked
at
his
hand
as
if
to
see
whether
any
of
its
speaking
properties
came
off
clearly
do
i
know
mark
you
pursued
wegg
pointing
his
words
with
his
forefinger
do
i
know
what
question
your
expressive
features
puts
to
me
question
said
venus
question
returned
wegg
with
a
sort
of
joyful
affability
i
did
mention
sooner
that
i
had
found
something
says
your
speaking
countenance
to
me
why
did
you
communicate
that
when
i
first
come
in
this
evening
why
did
you
keep
it
back
till
you
thought
mr
boffin
had
come
to
look
for
the
article
your
speaking
countenance
said
wegg
it
plainer
than
language
now
you
ca
read
in
my
face
what
answer
i
give
i
ca
said
venus
knew
it
and
why
not
returned
wegg
with
the
same
joyful
candour
i
lay
no
claims
to
a
speaking
countenance
because
i
am
well
aware
of
my
deficiencies
all
men
are
not
gifted
alike
but
i
can
answer
in
words
and
in
what
words
these
i
wanted
to
give
you
a
delightful
sap
pur
ize
having
thus
elongated
and
emphasized
the
word
surprise
mr
wegg
shook
his
friend
and
brother
by
both
hands
and
then
clapped
him
on
both
knees
like
an
affectionate
patron
who
entreated
him
not
to
mention
so
small
a
service
as
that
which
it
had
been
his
happy
privilege
to
render
speaking
countenance
said
wegg
answered
to
its
satisfaction
only
asks
then
what
have
you
found
why
i
hear
it
say
the
words
retorted
venus
snappishly
after
waiting
in
vain
you
hear
it
say
the
words
why
do
you
answer
it
me
out
said
wegg
to
hear
me
out
man
and
brother
partner
in
feelings
equally
with
undertakings
and
actions
i
have
found
a
hear
me
out
said
wegg
he
tried
to
reserve
whatever
he
could
and
whenever
disclosure
was
forced
upon
him
broke
into
a
radiant
gush
of
hear
me
out
a
certain
day
sir
said
venus
bluntly
no
returned
wegg
shaking
his
head
at
once
observantly
thoughtfully
and
playfully
sir
that
not
your
expressive
countenance
which
asks
that
question
that
your
voice
merely
your
voice
to
proceed
on
a
certain
day
sir
i
happened
to
be
walking
in
the
yard
taking
my
lonely
round
for
in
the
words
of
a
friend
of
my
own
family
the
author
of
all
well
arranged
as
a
duett
deserted
as
you
will
remember
mr
venus
by
the
waning
moon
when
stars
it
will
occur
to
you
before
i
mention
it
proclaim
night
cheerless
noon
on
tower
fort
or
tented
ground
the
sentry
walks
his
lonely
round
the
sentry
walks
under
those
circumstances
sir
i
happened
to
be
walking
in
the
yard
early
one
afternoon
and
happened
to
have
an
iron
rod
in
my
hand
with
which
i
have
been
sometimes
accustomed
to
beguile
the
monotony
of
a
literary
life
when
i
struck
it
against
an
object
not
necessary
to
trouble
you
by
naming
is
necessary
what
object
demanded
venus
in
a
wrathful
hear
me
out
said
wegg
when
i
struck
it
against
the
pump
and
found
not
only
that
the
top
was
loose
and
opened
with
a
lid
but
that
something
in
it
rattled
that
something
comrade
i
discovered
to
be
a
small
flat
oblong
shall
i
say
it
was
disappointingly
light
were
papers
in
it
said
venus
your
expressive
countenance
speaks
indeed
cried
wegg
paper
the
box
was
locked
tied
up
and
sealed
and
on
the
outside
was
a
parchment
label
with
the
writing
my
will
john
harmon
temporarily
deposited
must
know
its
contents
said
hear
me
out
cried
wegg
said
so
and
i
broke
the
box
open
coming
to
me
exclaimed
venus
so
sir
returned
wegg
blandly
and
buoyantly
see
i
take
you
with
me
hear
hear
hear
resolved
as
your
discriminating
good
sense
perceives
that
if
you
was
to
have
a
sap
pur
ize
it
should
be
a
complete
one
well
sir
and
so
as
you
have
honoured
me
by
anticipating
i
examined
the
document
regularly
executed
regularly
witnessed
very
short
inasmuch
as
he
has
never
made
friends
and
has
ever
had
a
rebellious
family
he
john
harmon
gives
to
nicodemus
boffin
the
little
mound
which
is
quite
enough
for
him
and
gives
the
whole
rest
and
residue
of
his
property
to
the
crown
date
of
the
will
that
has
been
proved
must
be
looked
to
remarked
venus
may
be
later
than
this
one
hear
me
out
cried
wegg
said
so
i
paid
a
shilling
never
mind
your
sixpence
of
it
to
look
up
that
will
brother
that
will
is
dated
months
before
this
will
and
now
as
a
and
as
a
partner
in
a
friendly
move
added
wegg
benignantly
taking
him
by
both
hands
again
and
clapping
him
on
both
knees
again
have
i
completed
my
labour
of
love
to
your
perfect
satisfaction
and
are
you
sap
pur
ized
mr
venus
contemplated
his
and
partner
with
doubting
eyes
and
then
rejoined
stiffly
is
great
news
indeed
mr
wegg
there
no
denying
it
but
i
could
have
wished
you
had
told
it
me
before
you
got
your
fright
and
i
could
have
wished
you
had
ever
asked
me
as
your
partner
what
we
were
to
do
before
you
thought
you
were
dividing
a
responsibility
hear
me
out
cried
wegg
knew
you
was
to
say
so
but
alone
i
bore
the
anxiety
and
alone
i
bear
the
blame
this
with
an
air
of
great
magnanimity
said
venus
see
this
will
and
this
box
i
understand
brother
returned
wegg
with
considerable
reluctance
it
is
your
wish
to
see
this
will
and
this
mr
venus
smote
the
table
with
his
hear
me
out
said
wegg
me
out
i
go
and
fetch
after
being
some
time
absent
as
if
in
his
covetousness
he
could
hardly
make
up
his
mind
to
produce
the
treasure
to
his
partner
he
returned
with
an
old
leathern
into
which
he
had
put
the
other
box
for
the
better
preservation
of
commonplace
appearances
and
for
the
disarming
of
suspicion
i
do
half
like
opening
it
here
said
silas
in
a
low
voice
looking
around
might
come
back
he
may
not
be
gone
we
do
know
what
he
may
be
up
to
after
what
we
seen
something
in
that
assented
venus
to
my
place
jealous
of
the
custody
of
the
box
and
yet
fearful
of
opening
it
under
the
existing
circumstances
wegg
hesitated
i
tell
you
repeated
venus
chafing
my
place
not
very
well
seeing
his
way
to
a
refusal
mr
wegg
then
rejoined
in
a
gush
hear
me
out
certainly
so
he
locked
up
the
bower
and
they
set
forth
mr
venus
taking
his
arm
and
keeping
it
with
remarkable
tenacity
they
found
the
usual
dim
light
burning
in
the
window
of
mr
establishment
imperfectly
disclosing
to
the
public
the
usual
pair
of
preserved
frogs
sword
in
hand
with
their
point
of
honour
still
unsettled
mr
venus
had
closed
his
shop
door
on
coming
out
and
now
opened
it
with
the
key
and
shut
it
again
as
soon
as
they
were
within
but
not
before
he
had
put
up
and
barred
the
shutters
of
the
shop
window
one
can
get
in
without
being
let
in
said
he
then
we
be
more
snug
than
here
so
he
raked
together
the
yet
warm
cinders
in
the
rusty
grate
and
made
a
fire
and
trimmed
the
candle
on
the
little
counter
as
the
fire
cast
its
flickering
gleams
here
and
there
upon
the
dark
greasy
walls
the
hindoo
baby
the
african
baby
the
articulated
english
baby
the
assortment
of
skulls
and
the
rest
of
the
collection
came
starting
to
their
various
stations
as
if
they
had
all
been
out
like
their
master
and
were
punctual
in
a
general
rendezvous
to
assist
at
the
secret
the
french
gentleman
had
grown
considerably
since
mr
wegg
last
saw
him
being
now
accommodated
with
a
pair
of
legs
and
a
head
though
his
arms
were
yet
in
abeyance
to
whomsoever
the
head
had
originally
belonged
silas
wegg
would
have
regarded
it
as
a
personal
favour
if
he
had
not
cut
quite
so
many
teeth
silas
took
his
seat
in
silence
on
the
wooden
box
before
the
fire
and
venus
dropping
into
his
low
chair
produced
from
among
his
skeleton
hands
his
and
and
put
the
kettle
on
silas
inwardly
approved
of
these
preparations
trusting
they
might
end
in
mr
diluting
his
intellect
sir
said
venus
is
safe
and
quiet
let
us
see
this
discovery
with
still
reluctant
hands
and
not
without
several
glances
towards
the
skeleton
hands
as
if
he
mistrusted
that
a
couple
of
them
might
spring
forth
and
clutch
the
document
wegg
opened
the
and
revealed
the
opened
the
and
revealed
the
will
he
held
a
corner
of
it
tight
while
venus
taking
hold
of
another
corner
searchingly
and
attentively
read
it
i
correct
in
my
account
of
it
partner
said
mr
wegg
at
length
you
were
said
mr
venus
mr
wegg
thereupon
made
an
easy
graceful
movement
as
though
he
would
fold
it
up
but
mr
venus
held
on
by
his
corner
sir
said
mr
venus
winking
his
weak
eyes
and
shaking
his
head
partner
the
question
is
now
brought
up
who
is
going
to
take
care
of
this
do
you
know
who
is
going
to
take
care
of
this
partner
am
said
wegg
dear
no
partner
retorted
venus
a
mistake
i
am
now
look
here
mr
wegg
i
do
want
to
have
any
words
with
you
and
still
less
do
i
want
to
have
any
anatomical
pursuits
with
you
do
you
mean
said
wegg
quickly
mean
partner
replied
venus
slowly
it
hardly
possible
for
a
man
to
feel
in
a
more
amiable
state
towards
another
man
than
i
do
towards
you
at
this
present
moment
but
i
am
on
my
own
ground
i
am
surrounded
by
the
trophies
of
my
art
and
my
tools
is
very
handy
do
you
mean
mr
venus
asked
wegg
again
am
surrounded
as
i
have
observed
said
mr
venus
placidly
the
trophies
of
my
art
they
are
numerous
my
stock
of
human
warious
is
large
the
shop
is
pretty
well
crammed
and
i
do
just
now
want
any
more
trophies
of
my
art
but
i
like
my
art
and
i
know
how
to
exercise
my
art
man
better
assented
mr
wegg
with
a
somewhat
staggered
air
the
miscellanies
of
several
human
specimens
said
venus
though
you
might
think
it
in
the
box
on
which
you
sitting
there
the
miscellanies
of
several
human
specimens
in
the
lovely
behind
the
door
with
a
nod
towards
the
french
gentleman
still
wants
a
pair
of
arms
i
do
say
that
i
in
any
hurry
for
must
be
wandering
in
your
mind
partner
silas
remonstrated
excuse
me
if
i
wander
returned
venus
am
sometimes
rather
subject
to
it
i
like
my
art
and
i
know
how
to
exercise
my
art
and
i
mean
to
have
the
keeping
of
this
document
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
your
art
partner
asked
wegg
in
an
insinuating
tone
mr
venus
winked
his
eyes
both
at
once
and
adjusting
the
kettle
on
the
fire
remarked
to
himself
in
a
hollow
voice
bile
in
a
couple
of
minutes
silas
wegg
glanced
at
the
kettle
glanced
at
the
shelves
glanced
at
the
french
gentleman
behind
the
door
and
shrank
a
little
as
he
glanced
at
mr
venus
winking
his
red
eyes
and
feeling
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
as
for
a
lancet
say
with
his
unoccupied
hand
he
and
venus
were
necessarily
seated
close
together
as
each
held
a
corner
of
the
document
which
was
but
a
common
sheet
of
paper
said
wegg
even
more
insinuatingly
than
before
propose
that
we
cut
it
in
half
and
each
keep
a
half
venus
shook
his
shock
of
hair
as
he
replied
would
do
to
mutilate
it
partner
it
might
seem
to
be
cancelled
said
wegg
after
a
silence
during
which
they
had
contemplated
one
another
your
speaking
countenance
say
that
you
to
suggest
a
middle
course
venus
shook
his
shock
of
hair
as
he
replied
you
have
kept
this
paper
from
me
once
you
shall
never
keep
it
from
me
again
i
offer
you
the
box
and
the
label
to
take
care
of
but
i
take
care
of
the
paper
silas
hesitated
a
little
longer
and
then
suddenly
releasing
his
corner
and
resuming
his
buoyant
and
benignant
tone
exclaimed
life
without
trustfulness
what
a
without
honour
you
welcome
to
it
partner
in
a
spirit
of
trust
and
confidence
continuing
to
wink
his
red
eyes
both
together
but
in
a
way
and
without
any
show
of
triumph
mr
venus
folded
the
paper
now
left
in
his
hand
and
locked
it
in
a
drawer
behind
him
and
pocketed
the
key
he
then
proposed
cup
of
tea
partner
to
which
mr
wegg
returned
partner
and
the
tea
was
made
and
poured
out
said
venus
blowing
at
his
tea
in
his
saucer
and
looking
over
it
at
his
confidential
friend
the
question
what
the
course
to
be
pursued
on
this
head
silas
wegg
had
much
to
say
silas
had
to
say
that
he
would
beg
to
remind
his
comrade
brother
and
partner
of
the
impressive
passages
they
had
read
that
evening
of
the
evident
parallel
in
mr
boffin
mind
between
them
and
the
late
owner
of
the
bower
and
the
present
circumstances
of
the
bower
of
the
bottle
and
of
the
box
that
the
fortunes
of
his
brother
and
comrade
and
of
himself
were
evidently
made
inasmuch
as
they
had
but
to
put
their
price
upon
this
document
and
get
that
price
from
the
minion
of
fortune
and
the
worm
of
the
hour
who
now
appeared
to
be
less
of
a
minion
and
more
of
a
worm
than
had
been
previously
supposed
that
he
considered
it
plain
that
such
price
was
stateable
in
a
single
expressive
word
and
that
the
word
was
that
the
question
then
arose
when
should
be
called
that
here
he
had
a
plan
of
action
to
recommend
with
a
conditional
clause
that
the
plan
of
action
was
that
they
should
lie
by
with
patience
that
they
should
allow
the
mounds
to
be
gradually
levelled
and
cleared
away
while
retaining
to
themselves
their
present
opportunity
of
watching
the
process
which
would
be
he
conceived
to
put
the
trouble
and
cost
of
daily
digging
and
delving
upon
somebody
else
while
they
might
nightly
turn
such
complete
disturbance
of
the
dust
to
the
account
of
their
own
private
investigations
and
that
when
the
mounds
were
gone
and
they
had
worked
those
chances
for
their
own
joint
benefit
solely
they
should
then
and
not
before
explode
on
the
minion
and
worm
but
here
came
the
conditional
clause
and
to
this
he
entreated
the
special
attention
of
his
comrade
brother
and
partner
it
was
not
to
be
borne
that
the
minion
and
worm
should
carry
off
any
of
that
property
which
was
now
to
be
regarded
as
their
own
property
when
he
mr
wegg
had
seen
the
minion
surreptitiously
making
off
with
that
bottle
and
its
precious
contents
unknown
he
had
looked
upon
him
in
the
light
of
a
mere
robber
and
as
such
would
have
despoiled
him
of
his
gain
but
for
the
judicious
interference
of
his
comrade
brother
and
partner
therefore
the
conditional
clause
he
proposed
was
that
if
the
minion
should
return
in
his
late
sneaking
manner
and
if
being
closely
watched
he
should
be
found
to
possess
himself
of
anything
no
matter
what
the
sharp
sword
impending
over
his
head
should
be
instantly
shown
him
he
should
be
strictly
examined
as
to
what
he
knew
or
suspected
should
be
severely
handled
by
them
his
masters
and
should
be
kept
in
a
state
of
abject
moral
bondage
and
slavery
until
the
time
when
they
should
see
fit
to
permit
him
to
purchase
his
freedom
at
the
price
of
half
his
possessions
if
said
mr
wegg
by
way
of
peroration
he
had
erred
in
saying
only
he
trusted
to
his
comrade
brother
and
partner
not
to
hesitate
to
set
him
right
and
to
reprove
his
weakness
it
might
be
more
according
to
the
rights
of
things
to
say
it
might
be
more
according
to
the
rights
of
things
to
say
on
those
points
he
was
ever
open
to
correction
mr
venus
having
wafted
his
attention
to
this
discourse
over
three
successive
saucers
of
tea
signified
his
concurrence
in
the
views
advanced
inspirited
hereby
mr
wegg
extended
his
right
hand
and
declared
it
to
be
a
hand
which
never
yet
without
entering
into
more
minute
particulars
mr
venus
sticking
to
his
tea
briefly
professed
his
belief
as
polite
forms
required
of
him
that
it
was
a
hand
which
never
yet
but
contented
himself
with
looking
at
it
and
did
not
take
it
to
his
bosom
said
wegg
when
this
happy
understanding
was
established
should
like
to
ask
you
something
you
remember
the
night
when
i
first
looked
in
here
and
found
you
floating
your
powerful
mind
in
tea
still
swilling
tea
mr
venus
nodded
assent
there
you
sit
sir
pursued
wegg
with
an
air
of
thoughtful
admiration
if
you
had
never
left
off
there
you
sit
sir
as
if
you
had
an
unlimited
capacity
of
assimilating
the
flagrant
article
there
you
sit
sir
in
the
midst
of
your
works
looking
as
if
you
been
called
upon
for
home
sweet
home
and
was
obleeging
the
company
a
exile
from
home
splendour
dazzles
in
vain
o
give
you
your
lowly
preparations
again
the
birds
stuffed
so
sweetly
that
ca
be
expected
to
come
at
your
call
give
you
these
with
the
peace
of
mind
dearer
than
all
home
home
home
sweet
home
be
it
ever
added
mr
wegg
in
prose
as
he
glanced
about
the
shop
so
ghastly
all
things
considered
there
no
place
like
it
said
you
like
to
ask
something
but
you
have
asked
it
remarked
venus
very
unsympathetic
in
manner
peace
of
mind
said
wegg
offering
condolence
peace
of
mind
was
in
a
poor
way
that
night
how
it
going
on
is
it
looking
up
at
all
does
not
wish
replied
mr
venus
with
a
comical
mixture
of
indignant
obstinacy
and
tender
melancholy
regard
herself
nor
yet
to
be
regarded
in
that
particular
light
there
no
more
to
be
said
dear
me
dear
me
exclaimed
wegg
with
a
sigh
but
eyeing
him
while
pretending
to
keep
him
company
in
eyeing
the
fire
is
woman
and
i
remember
you
said
that
night
sitting
there
as
i
sat
here
said
that
night
when
your
peace
of
mind
was
first
laid
low
that
you
had
taken
an
interest
in
these
very
affairs
such
is
coincidence
father
rejoined
venus
and
then
stopped
to
swallow
more
tea
father
was
mixed
up
in
them
did
mention
her
name
sir
i
think
observed
wegg
pensively
you
did
mention
her
name
that
night
riderhood
deed
cried
wegg
riderhood
there
something
moving
in
the
name
pleasant
dear
me
seems
to
express
what
she
might
have
been
if
she
had
made
that
unpleasant
remark
and
what
she
ai
in
consequence
of
having
made
it
would
it
at
all
pour
balm
into
your
wounds
mr
venus
to
inquire
how
you
came
acquainted
with
her
was
down
at
the
said
venus
taking
another
gulp
of
tea
and
mournfully
winking
at
the
fire
for
parrots
taking
another
gulp
and
stopping
mr
wegg
hinted
to
jog
his
attention
could
hardly
have
been
out
in
the
british
climate
sir
no
no
said
venus
fretfully
was
down
at
the
looking
for
parrots
brought
home
by
sailors
to
buy
for
stuffing
ay
ay
sir
and
looking
for
a
nice
pair
of
rattlesnakes
to
articulate
for
a
museum
when
i
was
doomed
to
fall
in
with
her
and
deal
with
her
it
was
just
at
the
time
of
that
discovery
in
the
river
her
father
had
seen
the
discovery
being
towed
in
the
river
i
made
the
popularity
of
the
subject
a
reason
for
going
back
to
improve
the
acquaintance
and
i
have
never
since
been
the
man
i
was
my
very
bones
is
rendered
flabby
by
brooding
over
it
if
they
could
be
brought
to
me
loose
to
sort
i
should
hardly
have
the
face
to
claim
as
mine
to
such
an
extent
have
i
fallen
off
under
it
mr
wegg
less
interested
than
he
had
been
glanced
at
one
particular
shelf
in
the
dark
i
remember
mr
venus
he
said
in
a
tone
of
friendly
commiseration
for
i
remember
every
word
that
falls
from
you
sir
i
remember
that
you
said
that
night
you
had
got
up
there
and
then
your
words
was
never
the
parrot
that
i
bought
of
her
said
venus
with
a
despondent
rise
and
fall
of
his
eyes
there
it
lies
on
its
side
dried
up
except
for
its
plumage
very
like
myself
i
never
had
the
heart
to
prepare
it
and
i
never
shall
have
now
with
a
disappointed
face
silas
mentally
consigned
this
parrot
to
regions
more
than
tropical
and
seeming
for
the
time
to
have
lost
his
power
of
assuming
an
interest
in
the
woes
of
mr
venus
fell
to
tightening
his
wooden
leg
as
a
preparation
for
departure
its
gymnastic
performances
of
that
evening
having
severely
tried
its
constitution
after
silas
had
left
the
shop
in
hand
and
had
left
mr
venus
to
lower
himself
to
with
the
requisite
weight
of
tea
it
greatly
preyed
on
his
ingenuous
mind
that
he
had
taken
this
artist
into
partnership
at
all
he
bitterly
felt
that
he
had
overreached
himself
in
the
beginning
by
grasping
at
mr
venus
mere
straws
of
hints
now
shown
to
be
worthless
for
his
purpose
casting
about
for
ways
and
means
of
dissolving
the
connexion
without
loss
of
money
reproaching
himself
for
having
been
betrayed
into
an
avowal
of
his
secret
and
complimenting
himself
beyond
measure
on
his
purely
accidental
good
luck
he
beguiled
the
distance
between
clerkenwell
and
the
mansion
of
the
golden
dustman
for
silas
wegg
felt
it
to
be
quite
out
of
the
question
that
he
could
lay
his
head
upon
his
pillow
in
peace
without
first
hovering
over
mr
boffin
house
in
the
superior
character
of
its
evil
genius
power
unless
it
be
the
power
of
intellect
or
virtue
has
ever
the
greatest
attraction
for
the
lowest
natures
and
the
mere
defiance
of
the
unconscious
with
his
power
to
strip
the
roof
off
the
inhabiting
family
like
the
roof
of
a
house
of
cards
was
a
treat
which
had
a
charm
for
silas
wegg
as
he
hovered
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
exulting
the
carriage
drove
up
shortly
be
an
end
of
you
said
wegg
threatening
it
with
the
varnish
is
fading
mrs
boffin
descended
and
went
in
out
for
a
fall
my
lady
dustwoman
said
wegg
bella
lightly
descended
and
ran
in
after
her
brisk
we
are
said
wegg
wo
run
so
gaily
to
your
old
shabby
home
my
girl
you
have
to
go
there
though
a
little
while
and
the
secretary
came
out
was
passed
over
for
you
said
wegg
you
had
better
provide
yourself
with
another
situation
young
man
mr
boffin
shadow
passed
upon
the
blinds
of
three
large
windows
as
he
trotted
down
the
room
and
passed
again
as
he
went
back
cried
wegg
there
are
you
where
the
bottle
you
would
give
your
bottle
for
my
box
dustman
having
now
composed
his
mind
for
slumber
he
turned
homeward
such
was
the
greed
of
the
fellow
that
his
mind
had
shot
beyond
halves
and
gone
straight
to
spoliation
of
the
whole
that
would
quite
do
he
considered
growing
cooler
as
he
got
away
what
would
happen
to
him
if
he
did
buy
us
up
we
should
get
nothing
by
that
we
so
judge
others
by
ourselves
that
it
had
never
come
into
his
head
before
that
he
might
not
buy
us
up
and
might
prove
honest
and
prefer
to
be
poor
it
caused
him
a
slight
tremor
as
it
passed
but
a
very
slight
one
for
the
idle
thought
was
gone
directly
grown
too
fond
of
money
for
that
said
wegg
grown
too
fond
of
money
the
burden
fell
into
a
strain
or
tune
as
he
stumped
along
the
pavements
all
the
way
home
he
stumped
it
out
of
the
rattling
streets
piano
with
his
own
foot
and
forte
with
his
wooden
leg
grown
too
fond
of
money
for
that
he
grown
too
fond
of
money
even
next
day
silas
soothed
himself
with
this
melodious
strain
when
he
was
called
out
of
bed
at
daybreak
to
set
open
the
and
admit
the
train
of
carts
and
horses
that
came
to
carry
off
the
little
mound
and
all
day
long
as
he
kept
unwinking
watch
on
the
slow
process
which
promised
to
protract
itself
through
many
days
and
weeks
whenever
to
save
himself
from
being
choked
with
dust
he
patrolled
a
little
cinderous
beat
he
established
for
the
purpose
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
diggers
he
still
stumped
to
the
tune

grown
too
fond
of
money
for
that
he

too
fond
of
money
chapter
the
end
of
a
long
journey
the
train
of
carts
and
horses
came
and
went
all
day
from
dawn
to
nightfall
making
little
or
no
daily
impression
on
the
heap
of
ashes
though
as
the

passed
on

seen
to

melting

in

these

life
patiently
to
earn

quietly
to

untouched

this
was

highest
sublunary
hope
nothing

at

was
the
track
in
which
her
last
home
lay
and
of
which
she
had
last
had
local
love
and
knowledge
she
had
hovered
for
a
little
while
in
the
near
neighbourhood
of
her
abandoned
dwelling
and
had
sold
and
knitted
and
sold
and
gone
on
in
the
pleasant
towns
of
chertsey
walton
kingston
and
staines
her
figure
came
to
be
quite
well
known
for
some
short
weeks
and
then
again
passed
on
she
would
take
her
stand
in
where
there
were
such
things
on
market
days
at
other
times
in
the
busiest
that
was
seldom
very
busy
portion
of
the
little
quiet
high
street
at
still
other
times
she
would
explore
the
outlying
roads
for
great
houses
and
would
ask
leave
at
the
lodge
to
pass
in
with
her
basket
and
would
not
often
get
it
but
ladies
in
carriages
would
frequently
make
purchases
from
her
trifling
stock
and
were
usually
pleased
with
her
bright
eyes
and
her
hopeful
speech
in
these
and
her
clean
dress
originated
a
fable
that
she
was
well
to
do
in
the
world
one
might
say
for
her
station
rich
as
making
a
comfortable
provision
for
its
subject
which
costs
nobody
anything
this
class
of
fable
has
long
been
popular
in
those
pleasant
little
towns
on
thames
you
may
hear
the
fall
of
the
water
over
the
weirs
or
even
in
still
weather
the
rustle
of
the
rushes
and
from
the
bridge
you
may
see
the
young
river
dimpled
like
a
young
child
playfully
gliding
away
among
the
trees
unpolluted
by
the
defilements
that
lie
in
wait
for
it
on
its
course
and
as
yet
out
of
hearing
of
the
deep
summons
of
the
sea
it
were
too
much
to
pretend
that
betty
higden
made
out
such
thoughts
no
but
she
heard
the
tender
river
whispering
to
many
like
herself
to
me
come
to
me
when
the
cruel
shame
and
terror
you
have
so
long
fled
from
most
beset
you
come
to
me
i
am
the
relieving
officer
appointed
by
eternal
ordinance
to
do
my
work
i
am
not
held
in
estimation
according
as
i
shirk
it
my
breast
is
softer
than
the
death
in
my
arms
is
peacefuller
than
among
the
come
to
me
there
was
abundant
place
for
gentler
fancies
too
in
her
untutored
mind
those
gentlefolks
and
their
children
inside
those
fine
houses
could
they
think
as
they
looked
out
at
her
what
it
was
to
be
really
hungry
really
cold
did
they
feel
any
of
the
wonder
about
her
that
she
felt
about
them
bless
the
dear
laughing
children
if
they
could
have
seen
sick
johnny
in
her
arms
would
they
have
cried
for
pity
if
they
could
have
seen
dead
johnny
on
that
little
bed
would
they
have
understood
it
bless
the
dear
children
for
his
sake
anyhow
so
with
the
humbler
houses
in
the
little
street
the
inner
firelight
shining
on
the
panes
as
the
outer
twilight
darkened
when
the
families
gathered
there
for
the
night
it
was
only
a
foolish
fancy
to
feel
as
if
it
were
a
little
hard
in
them
to
close
the
shutter
and
blacken
the
flame
so
with
the
lighted
shops
and
speculations
whether
their
masters
and
mistresses
taking
tea
in
a
perspective
of
not
so
far
within
but
that
the
flavour
of
tea
and
toast
came
out
mingled
with
the
glow
of
light
into
the
street
ate
or
drank
or
wore
what
they
sold
with
the
greater
relish
because
they
dealt
in
it
so
with
the
churchyard
on
a
branch
of
the
solitary
way
to
the
night
me
the
dead
and
i
seem
to
have
it
pretty
much
to
ourselves
in
the
dark
and
in
this
weather
but
so
much
the
better
for
all
who
are
warmly
housed
at
home
the
poor
soul
envied
no
one
in
bitterness
and
grudged
no
one
anything
but
the
old
abhorrence
grew
stronger
on
her
as
she
grew
weaker
and
it
found
more
sustaining
food
than
she
did
in
her
wanderings
now
she
would
light
upon
the
shameful
spectacle
of
some
desolate
creature
or
some
wretched
ragged
groups
of
either
sex
or
of
both
sexes
with
children
among
them
huddled
together
like
the
smaller
vermin
for
a
little
warmth
lingering
and
lingering
on
a
doorstep
while
the
appointed
evader
of
the
public
trust
did
his
dirty
office
of
trying
to
weary
them
out
and
so
get
rid
of
them
now
she
would
light
upon
some
poor
decent
person
like
herself
going
afoot
on
a
pilgrimage
of
many
weary
miles
to
see
some
relative
or
friend
who
had
been
charitably
clutched
off
to
a
great
blank
barren
union
house
as
far
from
old
home
as
the
county
jail
the
remoteness
of
which
is
always
its
worst
punishment
for
small
rural
offenders
and
in
its
dietary
and
in
its
lodging
and
in
its
tending
of
the
sick
a
much
more
penal
establishment
sometimes
she
would
hear
a
newspaper
read
out
and
would
learn
how
the
registrar
general
cast
up
the
units
that
had
within
the
last
week
died
of
want
and
of
exposure
to
the
weather
for
which
that
recording
angel
seemed
to
have
a
regular
fixed
place
in
his
sum
as
if
they
were
its
halfpence
all
such
things
she
would
hear
discussed
as
we
my
lords
and
gentlemen
and
honourable
boards
in
our
unapproachable
magnificence
never
hear
them
and
from
all
such
things
she
would
fly
with
the
wings
of
raging
despair
this
is
not
to
be
received
as
a
figure
of
speech
old
betty
higden
however
tired
however
footsore
would
start
up
and
be
driven
away
by
her
awakened
horror
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
charity
it
is
a
remarkable
christian
improvement
to
have
made
a
pursuing
fury
of
the
good
samaritan
but
it
was
so
in
this
case
and
it
is
a
type
of
many
many
many
two
incidents
united
to
intensify
the
old
unreasoning
abhorrence
granted
in
a
previous
place
to
be
unreasoning
because
the
people
always
are
unreasoning
and
invariably
make
a
point
of
producing
all
their
smoke
without
fire
one
day
she
was
sitting
in
a
on
a
bench
outside
an
inn
with
her
little
wares
for
sale
when
the
deadness
that
she
strove
against
came
over
her
so
heavily
that
the
scene
departed
from
before
her
eyes
when
it
returned
she
found
herself
on
the
ground
her
head
supported
by
some
and
a
little
crowd
about
her
you
better
now
mother
asked
one
of
the
women
you
think
you
can
do
nicely
now
i
been
ill
then
asked
old
betty
have
had
a
faint
like
was
the
answer
a
fit
it
ai
that
you
been
mother
but
you
been
stiff
and
numbed
said
betty
recovering
her
memory
the
numbness
yes
it
comes
over
me
at
times
was
it
gone
the
women
asked
her
gone
now
said
betty
shall
be
stronger
than
i
was
afore
many
thanks
to
ye
my
dears
and
when
you
come
to
be
as
old
as
i
am
may
others
do
as
much
for
you
they
assisted
her
to
rise
but
she
could
not
stand
yet
and
they
supported
her
when
she
sat
down
again
upon
the
bench
head
a
bit
light
and
my
feet
are
a
bit
heavy
said
old
betty
leaning
her
face
drowsily
on
the
breast
of
the
woman
who
had
spoken
before
both
come
in
a
minute
there
nothing
more
the
matter
her
said
some
farmers
standing
by
who
had
come
out
from
their
belongs
to
her
there
any
folks
belonging
to
you
mother
said
the
woman
sure
answered
betty
heerd
the
gentleman
say
it
but
i
could
answer
quick
enough
there
plenty
belonging
to
me
do
ye
fear
for
me
my
dear
are
any
of
near
here
said
the
men
voices
the
voices
chiming
in
when
it
was
said
and
prolonging
the
strain
near
enough
said
betty
rousing
herself
ye
be
afeard
for
me
neighbours
you
are
not
fit
to
travel
where
are
you
going
was
the
next
compassionate
chorus
she
heard
a
going
to
london
when
i
sold
out
all
said
betty
rising
with
difficulty
right
good
friends
in
london
i
want
for
nothing
i
shall
come
to
no
harm
thankye
do
ye
be
afeard
for
me
a
bystander
and
said
hoarsely
over
his
red
comforter
as
she
rose
to
her
feet
that
she
to
be
let
to
go
the
lord
love
do
meddle
with
me
cried
old
betty
all
her
fears
crowding
on
her
am
quite
well
now
and
i
must
go
this
minute
she
caught
up
her
basket
as
she
spoke
and
was
making
an
unsteady
rush
away
from
them
when
the
same
bystander
checked
her
with
his
hand
on
her
sleeve
and
urged
her
to
come
with
him
and
see
the
strengthening
herself
by
the
utmost
exercise
of
her
resolution
the
poor
trembling
creature
shook
him
off
almost
fiercely
and
took
to
flight
nor
did
she
feel
safe
until
she
had
set
a
mile
or
two
of
between
herself
and
the
marketplace
and
had
crept
into
a
copse
like
a
hunted
animal
to
hide
and
recover
breath
not
until
then
for
the
first
time
did
she
venture
to
recall
how
she
had
looked
over
her
shoulder
before
turning
out
of
the
town
and
had
seen
the
sign
of
the
white
lion
hanging
across
the
road
and
the
fluttering
market
booths
and
the
old
grey
church
and
the
little
crowd
gazing
after
her
but
not
attempting
to
follow
her
the
second
frightening
incident
was
this
she
had
been
again
as
bad
and
had
been
for
some
days
better
and
was
travelling
along
by
a
part
of
the
road
where
it
touched
the
river
and
in
wet
seasons
was
so
often
overflowed
by
it
that
there
were
tall
white
posts
set
up
to
mark
the
way
a
barge
was
being
towed
towards
her
and
she
sat
down
on
the
bank
to
rest
and
watch
it
as
the
was
slackened
by
a
turn
of
the
stream
and
dipped
into
the
water
such
a
confusion
stole
into
her
mind
that
she
thought
she
saw
the
forms
of
her
dead
children
and
dead
grandchildren
peopling
the
barge
and
waving
their
hands
to
her
in
solemn
measure
then
as
the
rope
tightened
and
came
up
dropping
diamonds
it
seemed
to
vibrate
into
two
parallel
ropes
and
strike
her
with
a
twang
though
it
was
far
off
when
she
looked
again
there
was
no
barge
no
river
no
daylight
and
a
man
whom
she
had
never
before
seen
held
a
candle
close
to
her
face
missis
said
he
did
you
come
from
and
where
are
you
going
to
the
poor
soul
confusedly
asked
the
where
she
was
am
the
lock
said
the
man
lock
am
the
deputy
lock
on
job
and
this
is
the
lock
or
deputy
lock
it
all
one
while
the
man
in
the
hospital
what
your
parish
she
was
up
from
the
directly
wildly
feeling
about
her
for
her
basket
and
gazing
at
him
in
affright
be
asked
the
question
down
town
said
the
man
wo
let
you
be
more
than
a
casual
there
they
pass
you
on
to
your
settlement
missis
with
all
speed
you
not
in
a
state
to
be
let
come
upon
strange
parishes
as
a
casual
the
deadness
again
murmured
betty
higden
with
her
hand
to
her
head
was
the
deadness
there
not
a
doubt
about
it
returned
the
man
should
have
thought
the
deadness
was
a
mild
word
for
it
if
it
had
been
named
to
me
when
we
brought
you
in
have
you
got
any
friends
missis
best
of
friends
master
should
recommend
your
looking
up
if
you
consider
game
to
do
anything
for
you
said
the
deputy
lock
you
got
any
money
a
morsel
of
money
sir
you
want
to
keep
it
i
do
you
know
said
the
deputy
lock
shrugging
his
shoulders
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
shaking
his
head
in
a
sulkily
ominous
manner
parish
authorities
down
town
will
have
it
out
of
you
if
you
go
on
you
may
take
your
alfred
david
i
not
go
on
make
you
pay
as
fur
as
your
money
will
go
pursued
the
deputy
your
relief
as
a
casual
and
for
your
being
passed
to
your
parish
ye
kindly
master
for
your
warning
thank
ye
for
your
shelter
and
good
night
a
bit
said
the
deputy
striking
in
between
her
and
the
door
are
you
all
of
a
shake
and
what
your
hurry
missis
master
master
returned
betty
higden
fought
against
the
parish
and
fled
from
it
all
my
life
and
i
want
to
die
free
of
it
do
know
said
the
deputy
with
deliberation
i
ought
to
let
you
go
i
a
honest
man
as
gets
my
living
by
the
sweat
of
my
brow
and
i
may
fall
into
trouble
by
letting
you
go
i
fell
into
trouble
afore
now
by
george
and
i
know
what
it
is
and
it
made
me
careful
you
might
be
took
with
your
deadness
again
half
a
mile
off
or
half
of
half
a
quarter
for
the
matter
of
that
and
then
it
would
be
asked
why
did
that
there
honest
deputy
lock
let
her
go
instead
of
putting
her
safe
with
the
parish
that
what
a
man
of
his
character
ought
to
have
done
it
would
be
argueyfied
said
the
deputy
lock
cunningly
harping
on
the
strong
string
of
her
terror
ought
to
have
handed
her
over
safe
to
the
parish
that
was
to
be
expected
of
a
man
of
his
merits
as
he
stood
in
the
doorway
the
poor
old
careworn
wayworn
woman
burst
into
tears
and
clasped
her
hands
as
if
in
a
very
agony
she
prayed
to
him
i
told
you
master
i
the
best
of
friends
this
letter
will
show
how
true
i
spoke
and
they
will
be
thankful
for
me
the
deputy
lock
opened
the
letter
with
a
grave
face
which
underwent
no
change
as
he
eyed
its
contents
but
it
might
have
done
if
he
could
have
read
them
amount
of
small
change
missis
he
said
with
an
abstracted
air
after
a
little
meditation
you
call
a
morsel
of
money
hurriedly
emptying
her
pocket
old
betty
laid
down
on
the
table
a
shilling
and
two
sixpenny
pieces
and
a
few
pence
i
was
to
let
you
go
instead
of
handing
you
over
safe
to
the
parish
said
the
deputy
counting
the
money
with
his
eyes
it
be
your
own
free
wish
to
leave
that
there
behind
you
it
master
take
it
and
welcome
and
thankful
a
man
said
the
deputy
giving
her
back
the
letter
and
pocketing
the
coins
one
by
one
earns
his
living
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
here
he
drew
his
sleeve
across
his
forehead
as
if
this
particular
portion
of
his
humble
gains
were
the
result
of
sheer
hard
labour
and
virtuous
industry
i
wo
stand
in
your
way
go
where
you
like
she
was
gone
out
of
the
as
soon
as
he
gave
her
this
permission
and
her
tottering
steps
were
on
the
road
again
but
afraid
to
go
back
and
afraid
to
go
forward
seeing
what
she
fled
from
in
the
of
the
lights
of
the
little
town
before
her
and
leaving
a
confused
horror
of
it
everywhere
behind
her
as
if
she
had
escaped
it
in
every
stone
of
every
she
struck
off
by
side
ways
among
which
she
got
bewildered
and
lost
that
night
she
took
refuge
from
the
samaritan
in
his
latest
accredited
form
under
a
farmer
rick
and
if
worth
thinking
of
perhaps
my
the
samaritan
had
in
the
lonely
night
by
on
the
other
side
she
would
have
most
devoutly
thanked
high
heaven
for
her
escape
from
him
the
morning
found
her
afoot
again
but
fast
declining
as
to
the
clearness
of
her
thoughts
though
not
as
to
the
steadiness
of
her
purpose
comprehending
that
her
strength
was
quitting
her
and
that
the
struggle
of
her
life
was
almost
ended
she
could
neither
reason
out
the
means
of
getting
back
to
her
protectors
nor
even
form
the
idea
the
overmastering
dread
and
the
proud
stubborn
resolution
it
engendered
in
her
to
die
undegraded
were
the
two
distinct
impressions
left
in
her
failing
mind
supported
only
by
a
sense
that
she
was
bent
on
conquering
in
her
fight
she
went
on
the
time
was
come
now
when
the
wants
of
this
little
life
were
passing
away
from
her
she
could
not
have
swallowed
food
though
a
table
had
been
spread
for
her
in
the
next
field
the
day
was
cold
and
wet
but
she
scarcely
knew
it
she
crept
on
poor
soul
like
a
criminal
afraid
of
being
taken
and
felt
little
beyond
the
terror
of
falling
down
while
it
was
yet
daylight
and
being
found
alive
she
had
no
fear
that
she
would
live
through
another
night
sewn
in
the
breast
of
her
gown
the
money
to
pay
for
her
burial
was
still
intact
if
she
could
wear
through
the
day
and
then
lie
down
to
die
under
cover
of
the
darkness
she
would
die
independent
if
she
were
captured
previously
the
money
would
be
taken
from
her
as
a
pauper
who
had
no
right
to
it
and
she
would
be
carried
to
the
accursed
workhouse
gaining
her
end
the
letter
would
be
found
in
her
breast
along
with
the
money
and
the
gentlefolks
would
say
when
it
was
given
back
to
them
prized
it
did
old
betty
higden
she
was
true
to
it
and
while
she
lived
she
would
never
let
it
be
disgraced
by
falling
into
the
hands
of
those
that
she
held
in
horror
most
illogical
inconsequential
and
this
but
travellers
in
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
are
apt
to
be
and
old
people
of
low
estate
have
a
trick
of
reasoning
as
indifferently
as
they
live
and
doubtless
would
appreciate
our
poor
law
more
philosophically
on
an
income
of
ten
thousand
a
year
so
keeping
to
byways
and
shunning
human
approach
this
troublesome
old
woman
hid
herself
and
fared
on
all
through
the
dreary
day
yet
so
unlike
was
she
to
vagrant
hiders
in
general
that
sometimes
as
the
day
advanced
there
was
a
bright
fire
in
her
eyes
and
a
quicker
beating
at
her
feeble
heart
as
though
she
said
exultingly
lord
will
see
me
through
it
by
what
visionary
hands
she
was
led
along
upon
that
journey
of
escape
from
the
samaritan
by
what
voices
hushed
in
the
grave
she
seemed
to
be
addressed
how
she
fancied
the
dead
child
in
her
arms
again
and
times
innumerable
adjusted
her
shawl
to
keep
it
warm
what
infinite
variety
of
forms
of
tower
and
roof
and
steeple
the
trees
took
how
many
furious
horsemen
rode
at
her
crying
she
goes
stop
stop
betty
higden
and
melted
away
as
they
came
close
be
these
things
left
untold
faring
on
and
hiding
hiding
and
faring
on
the
poor
harmless
creature
as
though
she
were
a
murderess
and
the
whole
country
were
up
after
her
wore
out
the
day
and
gained
the
night
or
such
like
she
had
sometimes
murmured
on
the
pilgrimage
when
she
had
raised
her
head
and
taken
any
note
of
the
real
objects
about
her
there
now
arose
in
the
darkness
a
great
building
full
of
lighted
windows
smoke
was
issuing
from
a
high
chimney
in
the
rear
of
it
and
there
was
the
sound
of
a
at
the
side
between
her
and
the
building
lay
a
piece
of
water
in
which
the
lighted
windows
were
reflected
and
on
its
nearest
margin
was
a
plantation
of
trees
humbly
thank
the
power
and
the
glory
said
betty
higden
holding
up
her
withered
hands
i
have
come
to
my
journey
end
she
crept
among
the
trees
to
the
trunk
of
a
tree
whence
she
could
see
beyond
some
intervening
trees
and
branches
the
lighted
windows
both
in
their
reality
and
their
reflection
in
the
water
she
placed
her
orderly
little
basket
at
her
side
and
sank
upon
the
ground
supporting
herself
against
the
tree
it
brought
to
her
mind
the
foot
of
the
cross
and
she
committed
herself
to
him
who
died
upon
it
her
strength
held
out
to
enable
her
to
arrange
the
letter
in
her
breast
so
as
that
it
could
be
seen
that
she
had
a
paper
there
it
had
held
out
for
this
and
it
departed
when
this
was
done
am
safe
here
was
her
last
benumbed
thought
i
am
found
dead
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
it
will
be
by
some
of
my
own
sort
some
of
the
working
people
who
work
among
the
lights
yonder
i
can
not
see
the
lighted
windows
now
but
they
are
there
i
am
thankful
for
all
the
darkness
gone
and
a
face
bending
down
can
not
be
the
boofer
lady
do
understand
what
you
say
let
me
wet
your
lips
again
with
this
brandy
i
have
been
away
to
fetch
it
did
you
think
that
i
was
long
gone
it
is
as
the
face
of
a
woman
shaded
by
a
quantity
of
rich
dark
hair
it
is
the
earnest
face
of
a
woman
who
is
young
and
handsome
but
all
is
over
with
me
on
earth
and
this
must
be
an
angel
i
been
long
dead
do
understand
what
you
say
let
me
wet
your
lips
again
i
hurried
all
i
could
and
brought
no
one
back
with
me
lest
you
should
die
of
the
shock
of
strangers
i
not
dead
can
not
understand
what
you
say
your
voice
is
so
low
and
broken
that
i
can
not
hear
you
do
you
hear
me
you
mean
yes
was
coming
from
my
work
just
now
along
the
path
outside
i
was
up
with
the
last
night
and
i
heard
a
groan
and
found
you
lying
here
work
deary
you
ask
what
work
at
the
is
it
face
is
turned
up
to
the
sky
and
you
ca
see
it
it
is
close
by
you
can
see
my
face
here
between
you
and
the
sky
i
lift
you
yet
even
lift
your
head
to
get
it
on
my
arm
i
will
do
it
by
very
gentle
degrees
you
shall
hardly
feel
it
yet
paper
letter
paper
in
your
breast
ye
me
wet
your
lips
again
am
i
to
open
it
to
read
it
ye
she
reads
it
with
surprise
and
looks
down
with
a
new
expression
and
an
added
interest
on
the
motionless
face
she
kneels
beside
know
these
names
i
have
heard
them
often
you
send
it
my
dear
can
not
understand
you
let
me
wet
your
lips
again
and
your
forehead
there
o
poor
thing
poor
thing
these
words
through
her
tears
was
it
that
you
asked
me
wait
till
i
bring
my
ear
quite
close
you
send
it
my
dear
i
send
it
to
the
writers
is
that
your
wish
yes
certainly
not
give
it
up
to
any
one
but
them
you
must
grow
old
in
time
and
come
to
your
dying
hour
my
dear
you
not
give
it
up
to
any
one
but
them
most
solemnly
to
the
parish
with
a
convulsed
struggle
most
solemnly
let
the
parish
touch
me
not
yet
so
much
as
look
at
me
with
another
struggle
faithfully
a
look
of
thankfulness
and
triumph
lights
the
worn
old
face
the
eyes
which
have
been
darkly
fixed
upon
the
sky
turn
with
meaning
in
them
towards
the
compassionate
face
from
which
the
tears
are
dropping
and
a
smile
is
on
the
aged
lips
as
they
ask
is
your
name
my
dear
name
is
lizzie
hexam
must
be
sore
disfigured
are
you
afraid
to
kiss
me
the
answer
is
the
ready
pressure
of
her
lips
upon
the
cold
but
smiling
mouth
ye
now
lift
me
my
love
lizzie
hexam
very
softly
raised
the
grey
head
and
lifted
her
as
high
as
heaven
chapter
somebody
becomes
the
subject
of
a
prediction
we
give
thee
hearty
thanks
for
that
it
hath
pleased
thee
to
deliver
this
our
sister
out
of
the
miseries
of
this
sinful
so
read
the
reverend
frank
milvey
in
a
not
untroubled
voice
for
his
heart
misgave
him
that
all
was
not
quite
right
between
us
and
our
sister
or
say
our
sister
in
law
poor
law
and
that
we
sometimes
read
these
words
in
an
awful
manner
over
our
sister
and
our
brother
too
and
sloppy
on
whom
the
brave
deceased
had
never
turned
her
back
until
she
ran
away
from
him
knowing
that
otherwise
he
would
not
be
separated
from
her
sloppy
could
not
in
his
conscience
as
yet
find
the
hearty
thanks
required
of
it
selfish
in
sloppy
and
yet
excusable
it
may
be
humbly
hoped
because
our
sister
had
been
more
than
his
mother
the
words
were
read
above
the
ashes
of
betty
higden
in
a
corner
of
a
churchyard
near
the
river
in
a
churchyard
so
obscure
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
but
not
so
much
as
one
single
tombstone
it
might
not
be
to
do
an
unreasonably
great
deal
for
the
diggers
and
hewers
in
a
registering
age
if
we
ticketed
their
graves
at
the
common
charge
so
that
a
new
generation
might
know
which
was
which
so
that
the
soldier
sailor
emigrant
coming
home
should
be
able
to
identify
the
of
father
mother
playmate
or
betrothed
for
we
turn
up
our
eyes
and
say
that
we
are
all
alike
in
death
and
we
might
turn
them
down
and
work
the
saying
out
in
this
world
so
far
it
would
be
sentimental
perhaps
but
how
say
ye
my
lords
and
gentleman
and
honourable
boards
shall
we
not
find
good
left
for
a
little
sentiment
if
we
look
into
our
crowds
near
unto
the
reverend
frank
milvey
as
he
read
stood
his
little
wife
john
rokesmith
the
secretary
and
bella
wilfer
these
over
and
above
sloppy
were
the
mourners
at
the
lowly
grave
not
a
penny
had
been
added
to
the
money
sewn
in
her
dress
what
her
honest
spirit
had
so
long
projected
was
fulfilled
took
it
in
my
head
said
sloppy
laying
it
inconsolable
against
the
church
door
when
all
was
done
took
it
in
my
wretched
head
that
i
might
have
sometimes
turned
a
little
harder
for
her
and
it
cuts
me
deep
to
think
so
now
the
reverend
frank
milvey
comforting
sloppy
expounded
to
him
how
the
best
of
us
were
more
or
less
remiss
in
our
turnings
at
our
respective
mangles
some
of
us
very
much
so
and
how
we
were
all
a
halting
failing
feeble
and
inconstant
crew
war
sir
said
sloppy
taking
this
ghostly
counsel
rather
ill
in
behalf
of
his
late
benefactress
us
speak
for
ourselves
sir
she
went
through
with
whatever
duty
she
had
to
do
she
went
through
with
me
she
went
through
with
the
minders
she
went
through
with
herself
she
went
through
with
everythink
o
mrs
higden
mrs
higden
you
was
a
woman
and
a
mother
and
a
mangler
in
a
million
million
with
those
heartfelt
words
sloppy
removed
his
dejected
head
from
the
church
door
and
took
it
back
to
the
grave
in
the
corner
and
laid
it
down
there
and
wept
alone
a
very
poor
grave
said
the
reverend
frank
milvey
brushing
his
hand
across
his
eyes
it
has
that
homely
figure
on
it
richer
i
think
than
it
could
be
made
by
most
of
the
sculpture
in
westminster
abbey
they
left
him
undisturbed
and
passed
out
at
the
the
of
the
was
audible
there
and
seemed
to
have
a
softening
influence
on
the
bright
wintry
scene
they
had
arrived
but
a
little
while
before
and
lizzie
hexam
now
told
them
the
little
she
could
add
to
the
letter
in
which
she
had
enclosed
mr
rokesmith
letter
and
had
asked
for
their
instructions
this
was
merely
how
she
had
heard
the
groan
and
what
had
afterwards
passed
and
how
she
had
obtained
leave
for
the
remains
to
be
placed
in
that
sweet
fresh
empty
of
the
mill
from
which
they
had
just
accompanied
them
to
the
churchyard
and
how
the
last
requests
had
been
religiously
observed
could
not
have
done
it
all
or
nearly
all
of
myself
said
lizzie
should
not
have
wanted
the
will
but
i
should
not
have
had
the
power
without
our
managing
partner
not
the
jew
who
received
us
said
mrs
milvey
dear
observed
her
husband
in
parenthesis
not
gentleman
certainly
is
a
jew
said
lizzie
the
lady
his
wife
is
a
jewess
and
i
was
first
brought
to
their
notice
by
a
jew
but
i
think
there
can
not
be
kinder
people
in
the
world
suppose
they
try
to
convert
you
suggested
mrs
milvey
bristling
in
her
good
little
way
as
a
clergyman
wife
do
what
asked
lizzie
with
a
modest
smile
make
you
change
your
religion
said
mrs
milvey
lizzie
shook
her
head
still
smiling
have
never
asked
me
what
my
religion
is
they
asked
me
what
my
story
was
and
i
told
them
they
asked
me
to
be
industrious
and
faithful
and
i
promised
to
be
so
they
most
willingly
and
cheerfully
do
their
duty
to
all
of
us
who
are
employed
here
and
we
try
to
do
ours
to
them
indeed
they
do
much
more
than
their
duty
to
us
for
they
are
wonderfully
mindful
of
us
in
many
ways
is
easy
to
see
you
a
favourite
my
dear
said
little
mrs
milvey
not
quite
pleased
would
be
very
ungrateful
in
me
to
say
i
am
not
returned
lizzie
i
have
been
already
raised
to
a
place
of
confidence
here
but
that
makes
no
difference
in
their
following
their
own
religion
and
leaving
all
of
us
to
ours
they
never
talk
of
theirs
to
us
and
they
never
talk
of
ours
to
us
if
i
was
the
last
in
the
mill
it
would
be
just
the
same
they
never
asked
me
what
religion
that
poor
thing
had
followed
dear
said
mrs
milvey
aside
to
the
reverend
frank
wish
you
would
talk
to
her
dear
said
the
reverend
frank
aside
to
his
good
little
wife
think
i
will
leave
it
to
somebody
else
the
circumstances
are
hardly
favourable
there
are
plenty
of
talkers
going
about
my
love
and
she
will
soon
find
one
while
this
discourse
was
interchanging
both
bella
and
the
secretary
observed
lizzie
hexam
with
great
attention
brought
face
to
face
for
the
first
time
with
the
daughter
of
his
supposed
murderer
it
was
natural
that
john
harmon
should
have
his
own
secret
reasons
for
a
careful
scrutiny
of
her
countenance
and
manner
bella
knew
that
father
had
been
falsely
accused
of
the
crime
which
had
had
so
great
an
influence
on
her
own
life
and
fortunes
and
her
interest
though
it
had
no
secret
springs
like
that
of
the
secretary
was
equally
natural
both
had
expected
to
see
something
very
different
from
the
real
lizzie
hexam
and
thus
it
fell
out
that
she
became
the
unconscious
means
of
bringing
them
together
for
when
they
had
walked
on
with
her
to
the
little
house
in
the
clean
village
by
the
where
lizzie
had
a
lodging
with
an
elderly
couple
employed
in
the
establishment
and
when
mrs
milvey
and
bella
had
been
up
to
see
her
room
and
had
come
down
the
mill
bell
rang
this
called
lizzie
away
for
the
time
and
left
the
secretary
and
bella
standing
rather
awkwardly
in
the
small
street
mrs
milvey
being
engaged
in
pursuing
the
village
children
and
her
investigations
whether
they
were
in
danger
of
becoming
children
of
israel
and
the
reverend
frank
being
engaged
to
say
the
truth
in
evading
that
branch
of
his
spiritual
functions
and
getting
out
of
sight
surreptitiously
bella
at
length
said
we
better
talk
about
the
commission
we
have
undertaken
mr
rokesmith
all
means
said
the
secretary
suppose
faltered
bella
we
are
both
commissioned
or
we
should
both
be
here
suppose
so
was
the
secretary
answer
i
proposed
to
come
with
mr
and
mrs
milvey
said
bella
boffin
urged
me
to
do
so
in
order
that
i
might
give
her
my
small
report
it
not
worth
anything
mr
rokesmith
except
for
it
being
a
woman
which
indeed
with
you
may
be
a
fresh
reason
for
it
being
worth
nothing
of
lizzie
hexam
boffin
said
the
secretary
me
to
come
for
the
same
purpose
as
they
spoke
they
were
leaving
the
little
street
and
emerging
on
the
wooded
landscape
by
the
river
think
well
of
her
mr
rokesmith
pursued
bella
conscious
of
making
all
the
advances
think
highly
of
her
am
so
glad
of
that
something
quite
refined
in
her
beauty
is
there
not
appearance
is
very
striking
is
a
shade
of
sadness
upon
her
that
is
quite
touching
at
least
i
i
am
not
setting
up
my
own
poor
opinion
you
know
mr
rokesmith
said
bella
excusing
and
explaining
herself
in
a
pretty
shy
way
am
consulting
you
noticed
that
sadness
i
hope
it
may
not
said
the
secretary
in
a
lower
voice
the
result
of
the
false
accusation
which
has
been
retracted
when
they
had
passed
on
a
little
further
without
speaking
bella
after
stealing
a
glance
or
two
at
the
secretary
suddenly
said
mr
rokesmith
do
be
hard
with
me
do
be
stern
with
me
be
magnanimous
i
want
to
talk
with
you
on
equal
terms
the
secretary
as
suddenly
brightened
and
returned
my
honour
i
had
no
thought
but
for
you
i
forced
myself
to
be
constrained
lest
you
might
misinterpret
my
being
more
natural
there
it
gone
you
said
bella
holding
out
her
little
hand
me
cried
the
secretary
eagerly
me
for
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
and
they
were
prettier
in
his
sight
though
they
smote
him
on
the
heart
rather
reproachfully
too
than
any
other
glitter
in
the
world
when
they
had
walked
a
little
further
were
going
to
speak
to
me
said
the
secretary
with
the
shadow
so
long
on
him
quite
thrown
off
and
cast
away
lizzie
hexam
so
was
i
going
to
speak
to
you
if
i
could
have
begun
that
you
can
begin
sir
returned
bella
with
a
look
as
if
she
italicized
the
word
by
putting
one
of
her
dimples
under
it
were
you
going
to
say
remember
of
course
that
in
her
short
letter
to
mrs
boffin
short
but
containing
everything
to
the
purpose
she
stipulated
that
either
her
name
or
else
her
place
of
residence
must
be
kept
strictly
a
secret
among
us
bella
nodded
yes
is
my
duty
to
find
out
why
she
made
that
stipulation
i
have
it
in
charge
from
mr
boffin
to
discover
and
i
am
very
desirous
for
myself
to
discover
whether
that
retracted
accusation
still
leaves
any
stain
upon
her
i
mean
whether
it
places
her
at
any
disadvantage
towards
any
one
even
towards
herself
said
bella
nodding
thoughtfully
understand
that
seems
wise
and
considerate
may
not
have
noticed
miss
wilfer
that
she
has
the
same
kind
of
interest
in
you
that
you
have
in
her
just
as
you
are
attracted
by
her
beaut
by
her
appearance
and
manner
she
is
attracted
by
yours
certainly
have
not
noticed
it
returned
bella
again
italicizing
with
the
dimple
i
should
have
given
her
credit
for
the
secretary
with
a
smile
held
up
his
hand
so
plainly
interposing
for
better
taste
that
bella
colour
deepened
over
the
little
piece
of
coquetry
she
was
checked
in
so
resumed
the
secretary
you
would
speak
with
her
alone
before
we
go
away
from
here
i
feel
quite
sure
that
a
natural
and
easy
confidence
would
arise
between
you
of
course
you
would
not
be
asked
to
betray
it
and
of
course
you
would
not
if
you
were
but
if
you
do
not
object
to
put
this
question
to
her
to
ascertain
for
us
her
own
feeling
in
this
one
matter
you
can
do
so
at
a
far
greater
advantage
than
i
or
any
else
could
mr
boffin
is
anxious
on
the
subject
and
i
am
added
the
secretary
after
a
moment
a
special
reason
very
anxious
shall
be
happy
mr
rokesmith
returned
bella
be
of
the
least
use
for
i
feel
after
the
serious
scene
of
that
i
am
useless
enough
in
this
world
say
that
urged
the
secretary
but
i
mean
that
said
bella
raising
her
eyebrows
one
is
useless
in
this
world
retorted
the
secretary
lightens
the
burden
of
it
for
any
one
else
i
assure
you
i
do
mr
rokesmith
said
bella
for
your
father
loving
pa
oh
yes
he
thinks
so
is
enough
if
he
only
thinks
so
said
the
secretary
the
interruption
i
do
like
to
hear
you
depreciate
yourself
you
once
depreciated
me
sir
thought
bella
pouting
i
hope
you
may
be
satisfied
with
the
consequences
you
brought
upon
your
head
however
she
said
nothing
to
that
purpose
she
even
said
something
to
a
different
purpose
rokesmith
it
seems
so
long
since
we
spoke
together
naturally
that
i
am
embarrassed
in
approaching
another
subject
mr
boffin
you
know
i
am
very
grateful
to
him
do
you
you
know
i
feel
a
true
respect
for
him
and
am
bound
to
him
by
the
strong
ties
of
his
own
generosity
now
do
you
and
also
that
you
are
his
favourite
companion
makes
it
said
bella
very
difficult
to
speak
of
him
but
does
he
treat
you
well
see
how
he
treats
me
the
secretary
answered
with
a
patient
and
yet
proud
air
and
i
see
it
with
pain
said
bella
very
energetically
the
secretary
gave
her
such
a
radiant
look
that
if
he
had
thanked
her
a
hundred
times
he
could
not
have
said
as
much
as
the
look
said
see
it
with
pain
repeated
bella
it
often
makes
me
miserable
miserable
because
i
can
not
bear
to
be
supposed
to
approve
of
it
or
have
any
indirect
share
in
it
miserable
because
i
can
not
bear
to
be
forced
to
admit
to
myself
that
fortune
is
spoiling
mr
boffin
wilfer
said
the
secretary
with
a
beaming
face
you
could
know
with
what
delight
i
make
the
discovery
that
fortune
is
spoiling
you
you
would
know
that
it
more
than
compensates
me
for
any
slight
at
any
other
hands
do
speak
of
me
said
bella
giving
herself
an
impatient
little
slap
with
her
glove
do
know
me
as
well
as
you
know
yourself
suggested
the
secretary
finding
that
she
stopped
you
know
yourself
know
quite
enough
of
myself
said
bella
with
a
charming
air
of
being
inclined
to
give
herself
up
as
a
bad
job
i
do
improve
upon
acquaintance
but
mr
boffin
mr
boffin
manner
to
me
or
consideration
for
me
is
not
what
it
used
to
be
observed
the
secretary
be
admitted
it
is
too
plain
to
be
denied
you
disposed
to
deny
it
mr
rokesmith
asked
bella
with
a
look
of
wonder
i
not
to
be
glad
to
do
so
if
i
could
though
it
were
only
for
my
own
sake
returned
bella
must
try
you
very
much
and
you
must
please
promise
me
that
you
wo
take
ill
what
i
am
going
to
add
mr
rokesmith
promise
it
with
all
my
heart
and
it
must
sometimes
i
should
think
said
bella
hesitating
little
lower
you
in
your
own
estimation
assenting
with
a
movement
of
his
head
though
not
at
all
looking
as
if
it
did
the
secretary
replied
have
very
strong
reasons
miss
wilfer
for
bearing
with
the
drawbacks
of
my
position
in
the
house
we
both
inhabit
believe
that
they
are
not
all
mercenary
although
i
have
through
a
series
of
strange
fatalities
faded
out
of
my
place
in
life
if
what
you
see
with
such
a
gracious
and
good
sympathy
is
calculated
to
rouse
my
pride
there
are
other
considerations
and
those
you
do
not
see
urging
me
to
quiet
endurance
the
latter
are
by
far
the
stronger
think
i
have
noticed
mr
rokesmith
said
bella
looking
at
him
with
curiosity
as
not
quite
making
him
out
you
repress
yourself
and
force
yourself
to
act
a
passive
part
are
right
i
repress
myself
and
force
myself
to
act
a
part
it
is
not
in
tameness
of
spirit
that
i
submit
i
have
a
settled
purpose
a
good
one
i
hope
said
bella
a
good
one
i
hope
he
answered
looking
steadily
at
her
i
have
fancied
sir
said
bella
turning
away
her
eyes
your
great
regard
for
mrs
boffin
is
a
very
powerful
motive
with
you
are
right
again
it
is
i
would
do
anything
for
her
bear
anything
for
her
there
are
no
words
to
express
how
i
esteem
that
good
good
woman
i
do
too
may
i
ask
you
one
thing
more
mr
rokesmith
more
course
you
see
that
she
really
suffers
when
mr
boffin
shows
how
he
is
changing
see
it
every
day
as
you
see
it
and
am
grieved
to
give
her
pain
give
her
pain
said
bella
repeating
the
phrase
quickly
with
her
eyebrows
raised
am
generally
the
unfortunate
cause
of
it
she
says
to
you
as
she
often
says
to
me
that
he
is
the
best
of
men
in
spite
of
all
often
overhear
her
in
her
honest
and
beautiful
devotion
to
him
saying
so
to
you
returned
the
secretary
with
the
same
steady
look
i
can
not
assert
that
she
ever
says
so
to
me
bella
met
the
steady
look
for
a
moment
with
a
wistful
musing
little
look
of
her
own
and
then
nodding
her
pretty
head
several
times
like
a
dimpled
philosopher
of
the
very
best
school
who
was
moralizing
on
life
heaved
a
little
sigh
and
gave
up
things
in
general
for
a
bad
job
as
she
had
previously
been
inclined
to
give
up
herself
but
for
all
that
they
had
a
very
pleasant
walk
the
trees
were
bare
of
leaves
and
the
river
was
bare
of
but
the
sky
was
not
bare
of
its
beautiful
blue
and
the
water
reflected
it
and
a
delicious
wind
ran
with
the
stream
touching
the
surface
crisply
perhaps
the
old
mirror
was
never
yet
made
by
human
hands
which
if
all
the
images
it
has
in
its
time
reflected
could
pass
across
its
surface
again
would
fail
to
reveal
some
scene
of
horror
or
distress
but
the
great
serene
mirror
of
the
river
seemed
as
if
it
might
have
reproduced
all
it
had
ever
reflected
between
those
placid
banks
and
brought
nothing
to
the
light
save
what
was
peaceful
pastoral
and
blooming
so
they
walked
speaking
of
the
newly
grave
and
of
johnny
and
of
many
things
so
on
their
return
they
met
brisk
mrs
milvey
coming
to
seek
them
with
the
agreeable
intelligence
that
there
was
no
fear
for
the
village
children
there
being
a
christian
school
in
the
village
and
no
worse
judaical
interference
with
it
than
to
plant
its
garden
so
they
got
back
to
the
village
as
lizzie
hexam
was
coming
from
the
and
bella
detached
herself
to
speak
with
her
in
her
own
home
am
afraid
it
is
a
poor
room
for
you
said
lizzie
with
a
smile
of
welcome
as
she
offered
the
post
of
honour
by
the
fireside
so
poor
as
you
think
my
dear
returned
bella
you
knew
all
indeed
though
attained
by
some
wonderful
winding
narrow
stairs
which
seemed
to
have
been
erected
in
a
pure
white
chimney
and
though
very
low
in
the
ceiling
and
very
rugged
in
the
floor
and
rather
blinking
as
to
the
proportions
of
its
lattice
window
it
was
a
pleasanter
room
than
that
despised
chamber
once
at
home
in
which
bella
had
first
bemoaned
the
miseries
of
taking
lodgers
the
day
was
closing
as
the
two
girls
looked
at
one
another
by
the
fireside
the
dusky
room
was
lighted
by
the
fire
the
grate
might
have
been
the
old
brazier
and
the
glow
might
have
been
the
old
hollow
down
by
the
flare
quite
new
to
me
said
lizzie
be
visited
by
a
lady
so
nearly
of
my
own
age
and
so
pretty
as
you
it
a
pleasure
to
me
to
look
at
you
have
nothing
left
to
begin
with
returned
bella
blushing
i
was
going
to
say
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
me
to
look
at
you
lizzie
but
we
can
begin
without
a
beginning
ca
we
lizzie
took
the
pretty
little
hand
that
was
held
out
in
as
pretty
a
little
frankness
dear
said
bella
drawing
her
chair
a
little
nearer
and
taking
lizzie
arm
as
if
they
were
going
out
for
a
walk
am
commissioned
with
something
to
say
and
i
dare
say
i
shall
say
it
wrong
but
i
wo
if
i
can
help
it
it
is
in
reference
to
your
letter
to
mr
and
mrs
boffin
and
this
is
what
it
is
let
me
see
oh
yes
this
is
what
it
is
with
this
exordium
bella
set
forth
that
request
of
lizzie
touching
secrecy
and
delicately
spoke
of
that
false
accusation
and
its
retraction
and
asked
might
she
beg
to
be
informed
whether
it
had
any
bearing
near
or
remote
on
such
request
feel
my
dear
said
bella
quite
amazing
herself
by
the
manner
in
which
she
was
getting
on
the
subject
must
be
a
painful
one
to
you
but
i
am
mixed
up
in
it
also
for
i
do
know
whether
you
may
know
it
or
suspect
it
i
am
the
girl
who
was
to
have
been
married
to
the
unfortunate
gentleman
if
he
had
been
pleased
to
approve
of
me
so
i
was
dragged
into
the
subject
without
my
consent
and
you
were
dragged
into
it
without
your
consent
and
there
is
very
little
to
choose
between
us
had
no
doubt
said
lizzie
you
were
the
miss
wilfer
i
have
often
heard
named
can
you
tell
me
who
my
unknown
friend
is
friend
my
dear
said
bella
caused
the
charge
against
poor
father
to
be
contradicted
and
sent
me
the
written
paper
bella
had
never
heard
of
him
had
no
notion
who
he
was
should
have
been
glad
to
thank
him
returned
lizzie
has
done
a
great
deal
for
me
i
must
hope
that
he
will
let
me
thank
him
some
day
you
asked
me
has
it
anything
to
do
or
the
accusation
itself
bella
put
in
has
either
anything
to
do
with
my
wishing
to
live
quite
secret
and
retired
here
no
as
lizzie
hexam
shook
her
head
in
giving
this
reply
and
as
her
glance
sought
the
fire
there
was
a
quiet
resolution
in
her
folded
hands
not
lost
on
bella
bright
eyes
you
lived
much
alone
asked
bella
it
nothing
new
to
me
i
used
to
be
always
alone
many
hours
together
in
the
day
and
in
the
night
when
poor
father
was
alive
have
a
brother
i
have
been
told
have
a
brother
but
he
is
not
friendly
with
me
he
is
a
very
good
boy
though
and
has
raised
himself
by
his
industry
i
do
complain
of
him
as
she
said
it
with
her
eyes
upon
the
there
was
an
instantaneous
escape
of
distress
into
her
face
bella
seized
the
moment
to
touch
her
hand
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
whether
you
have
any
friend
of
your
own
sex
and
age
have
lived
that
lonely
kind
of
life
that
i
have
never
had
one
was
the
answer
i
neither
said
bella
that
my
life
has
been
lonely
for
i
could
have
sometimes
wished
it
lonelier
instead
of
having
ma
going
on
like
the
tragic
muse
with
a
in
majestic
corners
and
lavvy
being
spiteful
though
of
course
i
am
very
fond
of
them
both
i
wish
you
could
make
a
friend
of
me
lizzie
do
you
think
you
could
i
have
no
more
of
what
they
call
character
my
dear
than
a
but
i
know
i
am
trustworthy
the
wayward
playful
affectionate
nature
giddy
for
want
of
the
weight
of
some
sustaining
purpose
and
capricious
because
it
was
always
fluttering
among
little
things
was
yet
a
captivating
one
to
lizzie
it
was
so
new
so
pretty
at
once
so
womanly
and
so
childish
that
it
won
her
completely
and
when
bella
said
again
you
think
you
could
lizzie
with
her
eyebrows
raised
her
head
inquiringly
on
one
side
and
an
odd
doubt
about
it
in
her
own
bosom
lizzie
showed
beyond
all
question
that
she
thought
she
could
me
my
dear
said
bella
is
the
matter
and
why
you
live
like
this
lizzie
presently
began
by
way
of
prelude
must
have
many
lovers
when
bella
checked
her
with
a
little
scream
of
astonishment
dear
i
have
one
one
perhaps
one
said
bella
am
sure
i
do
know
i
had
one
but
what
he
may
think
about
it
at
the
present
time
i
ca
say
perhaps
i
have
half
a
one
of
course
i
do
count
that
idiot
george
sampson
however
never
mind
me
i
want
to
hear
about
you
is
a
certain
man
said
lizzie
passionate
and
angry
man
who
says
he
loves
me
and
who
i
must
believe
does
love
me
he
is
the
friend
of
my
brother
i
shrank
from
him
within
myself
when
my
brother
first
brought
him
to
me
but
the
last
time
i
saw
him
he
terrified
me
more
than
i
can
say
there
she
stopped
you
come
here
to
escape
from
him
lizzie
came
here
immediately
after
he
so
alarmed
me
you
afraid
of
him
here
am
not
timid
generally
but
i
am
always
afraid
of
him
i
am
afraid
to
see
a
newspaper
or
to
hear
a
word
spoken
of
what
is
done
in
london
lest
he
should
have
done
some
violence
you
are
not
afraid
of
him
for
yourself
dear
said
bella
after
pondering
on
the
words
should
be
even
that
if
i
met
him
about
here
i
look
round
for
him
always
as
i
pass
to
and
fro
at
night
you
afraid
of
anything
he
may
do
to
himself
in
london
my
dear
he
might
be
fierce
enough
even
to
do
some
violence
to
himself
but
i
do
think
of
that
it
would
almost
seem
dear
said
bella
quaintly
if
there
must
be
somebody
else
lizzie
put
her
hands
before
her
face
for
a
moment
before
replying
words
are
always
in
my
ears
and
the
blow
he
struck
upon
a
stone
wall
as
he
said
them
is
always
before
my
eyes
i
have
tried
hard
to
think
it
not
worth
remembering
but
i
can
not
make
so
little
of
it
his
hand
was
trickling
down
with
blood
as
he
said
to
me
then
i
hope
that
i
may
never
kill
him
rather
startled
bella
made
and
clasped
a
girdle
of
her
arms
round
lizzie
waist
and
then
asked
quietly
in
a
soft
voice
as
they
both
looked
at
the
fire
him
is
this
man
so
jealous
then
a
gentleman
said
lizzie
i
hardly
know
how
to
tell
you
of
a
gentleman
far
above
me
and
my
way
of
life
who
broke
father
death
to
me
and
has
shown
an
interest
in
me
since
he
love
you
lizzie
shook
her
head
he
admire
you
lizzie
ceased
to
shake
her
head
and
pressed
her
hand
upon
her
living
girdle
it
through
his
influence
that
you
came
here
no
and
of
all
the
world
i
would
have
him
know
that
i
am
here
or
get
the
least
clue
where
to
find
me
dear
why
asked
bella
in
amazement
at
this
burst
but
then
quickly
added
reading
lizzie
face
do
say
why
that
was
a
foolish
question
of
mine
i
see
i
see
there
was
silence
between
them
lizzie
with
a
drooping
head
glanced
down
at
the
glow
in
the
fire
where
her
first
fancies
had
been
nursed
and
her
first
escape
made
from
the
grim
life
out
of
which
she
had
plucked
her
brother
foreseeing
her
reward
know
all
now
she
said
raising
her
eyes
to
bella
is
nothing
left
out
this
is
my
reason
for
living
secret
here
with
the
aid
of
a
good
old
man
who
is
my
true
friend
for
a
short
part
of
my
life
at
home
with
father
i
knew
of
things
do
ask
me
what
that
i
set
my
face
against
and
tried
to
better
i
do
think
i
could
have
done
more
then
without
letting
my
hold
on
father
go
but
they
sometimes
lie
heavy
on
my
mind
by
doing
all
for
the
best
i
hope
i
may
wear
them
out
wear
out
too
said
bella
soothingly
weakness
lizzie
in
favour
of
one
who
is
not
worthy
of
it
i
do
want
to
wear
that
out
was
the
flushed
reply
do
i
want
to
believe
nor
do
i
believe
that
he
is
not
worthy
of
it
what
should
i
gain
by
that
and
how
much
should
i
lose
bella
expressive
little
eyebrows
remonstrated
with
the
fire
for
some
short
time
before
she
rejoined
think
that
i
press
you
lizzie
but
would
you
gain
in
peace
and
hope
and
even
in
freedom
would
it
be
better
not
to
live
a
secret
life
in
hiding
and
not
to
be
shut
out
from
your
natural
and
wholesome
prospects
forgive
my
asking
you
would
that
be
no
gain
a
woman
heart
that
that
has
that
weakness
in
it
which
you
have
spoken
of
returned
lizzie
to
gain
anything
the
question
was
so
directly
at
variance
with
bella
views
in
life
as
set
forth
to
her
father
that
she
said
internally
you
little
mercenary
wretch
do
you
hear
that
ai
you
ashamed
of
your
self
and
unclasped
the
girdle
of
her
arms
expressly
to
give
herself
a
penitential
poke
in
the
side
you
said
lizzie
observed
bella
returning
to
her
subject
when
she
had
administered
this
chastisement
you
would
lose
besides
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
you
would
lose
lizzie
should
lose
some
of
the
best
recollections
best
encouragements
and
best
objects
that
i
carry
through
my
daily
life
i
should
lose
my
belief
that
if
i
had
been
his
equal
and
he
had
loved
me
i
should
have
tried
with
all
my
might
to
make
him
better
and
happier
as
he
would
have
made
me
i
should
lose
almost
all
the
value
that
i
put
upon
the
little
learning
i
have
which
is
all
owing
to
him
and
which
i
conquered
the
difficulties
of
that
he
might
not
think
it
thrown
away
upon
me
i
should
lose
a
kind
of
picture
of
him
or
of
what
he
might
have
been
if
i
had
been
a
lady
and
he
had
loved
me
which
is
always
with
me
and
which
i
somehow
feel
that
i
could
not
do
a
mean
or
a
wrong
thing
before
i
should
leave
off
prizing
the
remembrance
that
he
has
done
me
nothing
but
good
since
i
have
known
him
and
that
he
has
made
a
change
within
me
like
like
the
change
in
the
grain
of
these
hands
which
were
coarse
and
cracked
and
hard
and
brown
when
i
rowed
on
the
river
with
father
and
are
softened
and
made
supple
by
this
new
work
as
you
see
them
now
they
trembled
but
with
no
weakness
as
she
showed
them
me
my
dear
thus
she
went
on
have
never
dreamed
of
the
possibility
of
his
being
anything
to
me
on
this
earth
but
the
kind
picture
that
i
know
i
could
not
make
you
understand
if
the
understanding
was
not
in
your
own
breast
already
i
have
no
more
dreamed
of
the
possibility
of
my
being
his
wife
than
he
ever
has
and
words
could
not
be
stronger
than
that
and
yet
i
love
him
i
love
him
so
much
and
so
dearly
that
when
i
sometimes
think
my
life
may
be
but
a
weary
one
i
am
proud
of
it
and
glad
of
it
i
am
proud
and
glad
to
suffer
something
for
him
even
though
it
is
of
no
service
to
him
and
he
will
never
know
of
it
or
care
for
it
bella
sat
enchained
by
the
deep
unselfish
passion
of
this
girl
or
woman
of
her
own
age
courageously
revealing
itself
in
the
confidence
of
her
sympathetic
perception
of
its
truth
and
yet
she
had
never
experienced
anything
like
it
or
thought
of
the
existence
of
anything
like
it
was
late
upon
a
wretched
night
said
lizzie
his
eyes
first
looked
at
me
in
my
old
home
very
different
from
this
his
eyes
may
never
look
at
me
again
i
would
rather
that
they
never
did
i
hope
that
they
never
may
but
i
would
not
have
the
light
of
them
taken
out
of
my
life
for
anything
my
life
can
give
me
i
have
told
you
everything
now
my
dear
if
it
comes
a
little
strange
to
me
to
have
parted
with
it
i
am
not
sorry
i
had
no
thought
of
ever
parting
with
a
single
word
of
it
a
moment
before
you
came
in
but
you
came
in
and
my
mind
changed
bella
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
and
thanked
her
warmly
for
her
confidence
only
wish
said
bella
was
more
deserving
of
it
deserving
of
it
repeated
lizzie
with
an
incredulous
smile
do
mean
in
respect
of
keeping
it
said
bella
any
one
should
tear
me
to
bits
before
getting
at
a
syllable
of
it
though
there
no
merit
in
that
for
i
am
naturally
as
obstinate
as
a
pig
what
i
mean
is
lizzie
that
i
am
a
mere
impertinent
piece
of
conceit
and
you
shame
me
lizzie
put
up
the
pretty
brown
hair
that
came
tumbling
down
owing
to
the
energy
with
which
bella
shook
her
head
and
she
remonstrated
while
thus
engaged
dear
it
all
very
well
to
call
me
your
dear
said
bella
with
a
pettish
whimper
i
am
glad
to
be
called
so
though
i
have
slight
enough
claim
to
be
but
i
am
such
a
nasty
little
thing
dear
urged
lizzie
again
a
shallow
cold
worldly
limited
little
brute
said
bella
bringing
out
her
last
adjective
with
culminating
force
you
think
inquired
lizzie
with
her
quiet
smile
the
hair
being
now
secured
i
do
know
better
you
know
better
though
said
bella
you
really
believe
you
know
better
oh
i
should
be
so
glad
if
you
did
know
better
but
i
am
so
very
much
afraid
that
i
must
know
best
lizzie
asked
her
laughing
outright
whether
she
ever
saw
her
own
face
or
heard
her
own
voice
suppose
so
returned
bella
look
in
the
glass
often
enough
and
i
chatter
like
a
magpie
have
seen
your
face
and
heard
your
voice
at
any
rate
said
lizzie
they
have
tempted
me
to
say
to
you
with
a
certainty
of
not
going
wrong
what
i
thought
i
should
never
say
to
any
one
does
that
look
ill
i
hope
it
does
pouted
bella
stopping
herself
in
something
between
a
humoured
laugh
and
a
humoured
sob
used
once
to
see
pictures
in
the
fire
said
lizzie
playfully
please
my
brother
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
see
down
there
where
the
fire
is
glowing
they
had
risen
and
were
standing
on
the
hearth
the
time
being
come
for
separating
each
had
drawn
an
arm
around
the
other
to
take
leave
i
tell
you
asked
lizzie
i
see
down
there
little
b
suggested
bella
with
her
eyebrows
raised
heart
well
worth
winning
and
well
won
a
heart
that
once
won
goes
through
fire
and
water
for
the
winner
and
never
changes
and
is
never
daunted
heart
asked
bella
with
accompanying
eyebrows
lizzie
nodded
the
figure
to
which
it
belongs
is
yours
suggested
bella
most
clearly
and
distinctly
yours
so
the
interview
terminated
with
pleasant
words
on
both
sides
and
with
many
reminders
on
the
part
of
bella
that
they
were
friends
and
pledges
that
she
would
soon
come
down
into
that
part
of
the
country
again
there
with
lizzie
returned
to
her
occupation
and
bella
ran
over
to
the
little
inn
to
rejoin
her
company
look
rather
serious
miss
wilfer
was
the
secretary
first
remark
feel
rather
serious
returned
miss
wilfer
she
had
nothing
else
to
tell
him
but
that
lizzie
hexam
secret
had
no
reference
whatever
to
the
cruel
charge
or
its
withdrawal
oh
yes
though
said
bella
she
might
as
well
mention
one
other
thing
lizzie
was
very
desirous
to
thank
her
unknown
friend
who
had
sent
her
the
written
retractation
was
she
indeed
observed
the
secretary
ah
bella
asked
him
had
he
any
notion
who
that
unknown
friend
might
be
he
had
no
notion
whatever
they
were
on
the
borders
of
oxfordshire
so
far
had
poor
old
betty
higden
strayed
they
were
to
return
by
the
train
presently
and
the
station
being
near
at
hand
the
reverend
frank
and
mrs
frank
and
sloppy
and
bella
and
the
secretary
set
out
to
walk
to
it
few
rustic
paths
are
wide
enough
for
five
and
bella
and
the
secretary
dropped
behind
you
believe
mr
rokesmith
said
bella
i
feel
as
if
whole
years
had
passed
since
i
went
into
lizzie
hexam
cottage
have
crowded
a
good
deal
into
the
day
he
returned
you
were
much
affected
in
the
churchyard
you
are
i
am
not
at
all
tired
i
have
not
quite
expressed
what
i
mean
i
do
mean
that
i
feel
as
if
a
great
space
of
time
had
gone
by
but
that
i
feel
as
if
much
had
happened
to
myself
you
know
good
i
hope
hope
so
said
bella
are
cold
i
felt
you
tremble
pray
let
me
put
this
wrapper
of
mine
about
you
may
i
fold
it
over
this
shoulder
without
injuring
your
dress
now
it
will
be
too
heavy
and
too
long
let
me
carry
this
end
over
my
arm
as
you
have
no
arm
to
give
me
yes
she
had
though
how
she
got
it
out
in
her
muffled
state
heaven
knows
but
she
got
it
out
somehow
there
it
was
and
slipped
it
through
the
secretary
have
had
a
long
and
interesting
talk
with
lizzie
mr
rokesmith
and
she
gave
me
her
full
confidence
could
not
withhold
it
said
the
secretary
wonder
how
you
come
said
bella
stopping
short
as
she
glanced
at
him
say
to
me
just
what
she
said
about
it
infer
that
it
must
be
because
i
feel
just
as
she
felt
about
it
how
was
that
do
you
mean
to
say
sir
asked
bella
moving
again
if
you
were
inclined
to
win
her
confidence
confidence
you
were
sure
to
do
it
the
railway
at
this
point
knowingly
shutting
a
green
eye
and
opening
a
red
one
they
had
to
run
for
it
as
bella
could
not
run
easily
so
wrapped
up
the
secretary
had
to
help
her
when
she
took
her
opposite
place
in
the
carriage
corner
the
brightness
in
her
face
was
so
charming
to
behold
that
on
her
exclaiming
beautiful
stars
and
what
a
glorious
night
the
secretary
said
but
seemed
to
prefer
to
see
the
night
and
the
stars
in
the
light
of
her
lovely
little
countenance
to
looking
out
of
window
o
boofer
lady
fascinating
boofer
lady
if
i
were
but
legally
executor
of
johnny
will
if
i
had
but
the
right
to
pay
your
legacy
and
to
take
your
receipt
something
to
this
purpose
surely
mingled
with
the
blast
of
the
train
as
it
cleared
the
stations
all
knowingly
shutting
up
their
green
eyes
and
opening
their
red
ones
when
they
prepared
to
let
the
boofer
lady
pass
chapter
scouts
out
so
miss
wren
said
mr
eugene
wrayburn
can
not
persuade
you
to
dress
me
a
doll
replied
miss
wren
snappishly
you
want
one
go
and
buy
one
at
the
shop
my
charming
young
goddaughter
said
mr
wrayburn
plaintively
in
hertfordshire
you
mean
i
think
interposed
miss
wren
is
to
be
put
upon
the
cold
footing
of
the
general
public
and
is
to
derive
no
advantage
from
my
private
acquaintance
with
the
court
dressmaker
it
any
advantage
to
your
charming
godchild
and
oh
a
precious
godfather
she
has
got
replied
miss
wren
pricking
at
him
in
the
air
with
her
needle
be
informed
that
the
court
dressmaker
knows
your
tricks
and
your
manners
you
may
tell
her
so
by
post
with
my
compliments
miss
wren
was
busy
at
her
work
by
and
mr
wrayburn
half
amused
and
half
vexed
and
all
idle
and
shiftless
stood
by
her
bench
looking
on
miss
wren
troublesome
child
was
in
the
corner
in
deep
disgrace
and
exhibiting
great
wretchedness
in
the
shivering
stage
of
prostration
from
drink
you
disgraceful
boy
exclaimed
miss
wren
attracted
by
the
sound
of
his
chattering
teeth
wish
they
all
drop
down
your
throat
and
play
at
dice
in
your
stomach
boh
wicked
child
black
sheep
on
her
accompanying
each
of
these
reproaches
with
a
threatening
stamp
of
the
foot
the
wretched
creature
protested
with
a
whine
five
shillings
for
you
indeed
miss
wren
proceeded
many
hours
do
you
suppose
it
costs
me
to
earn
five
shillings

infamous
boy

like
that
or
i
throw
a
doll
at
you
pay
five
shillings
fine
for

more
ways
than
one

think

the
dustman
five
shillings
to
carry
you
off
in
the
dust
cart
no
pleaded
the
absurd
creature
enough
to
break
his
mother
heart
is
this
boy
said
miss
wren
half
appealing
to
eugene
wish
i
had
never
brought
him
up
he
be
sharper
than
a
serpent
tooth
if
he
was
as
dull
as
ditch
water
look
at
him
there
a
pretty
object
for
a
parent
eyes
assuredly
in
his
worse
than
swinish
state
for
swine
at
least
fatten
on
their
guzzling
and
make
themselves
good
to
eat
he
was
a
pretty
object
for
any
eyes
muddling
and
a
swipey
old
child
said
miss
wren
rating
him
with
great
severity
for
nothing
but
to
be
preserved
in
the
liquor
that
destroys
him
and
put
in
a
great
glass
bottle
as
a
sight
for
other
swipey
children
of
his
own
pattern
if
he
has
no
consideration
for
his
liver
has
he
none
for
his
mother
deration
oh
do
cried
the
subject
of
these
angry
remarks
do
and
oh
do
pursued
miss
wren
oh
do
and
oh
do
and
why
do
you
do
so
any
more
wo
indeed

miss
wren
covering
her
eyes
with
her
hand

to
look
at

up
stairs
and
get
me
my
bonnet
and
shawl
make
yourself
useful
in
some
way
bad
boy
and
let
me
have
your
room
instead
of
your
company
for
one
half
minute
obeying
her
he
shambled
out
and
eugene
wrayburn
saw
the
tears
exude
from
between
the
little
creature
fingers
as
she
kept
her
hand
before
her
eyes
he
was
sorry
but
his
sympathy
did
not
move
his
carelessness
to
do
anything
but
feel
sorry
going
to
the
italian
opera
to
try
on
said
miss
wren
taking
away
her
hand
after
a
little
while
and
laughing
satirically
to
hide
that
she
had
been
crying
must
see
your
back
before
i
go
mr
wrayburn
let
me
first
tell
you
once
for
all
that
it
of
no
use
your
paying
visits
to
me
you
would
get
what
you
want
of
me
no
not
if
you
brought
pincers
with
you
to
tear
it
out
you
so
obstinate
on
the
subject
of
a
doll
dress
for
my
godchild
returned
miss
wren
with
a
hitch
of
her
chin
am
so
obstinate
and
of
course
it
on
the
subject
of
a
doll
dress
or
address
whichever
you
like
get
along
and
give
it
up
her
degraded
charge
had
come
back
and
was
standing
behind
her
with
the
bonnet
and
shawl
to
me
and
get
back
into
your
corner
you
naughty
old
thing
said
miss
wren
as
she
turned
and
espied
him
no
i
wo
have
your
help
go
into
your
corner
this
minute
the
miserable
man
feebly
rubbing
the
back
of
his
faltering
hands
downward
from
the
wrists
shuffled
on
to
his
post
of
disgrace
but
not
without
a
curious
glance
at
eugene
in
passing
him
accompanied
with
what
seemed
as
if
it
might
have
been
an
action
of
his
elbow
if
any
action
of
any
limb
or
joint
he
had
would
have
answered
truly
to
his
will
taking
no
more
particular
notice
of
him
than
instinctively
falling
away
from
the
disagreeable
contact
eugene
with
a
lazy
compliment
or
so
to
miss
wren
begged
leave
to
light
his
cigar
and
departed
you
prodigal
old
son
said
jenny
shaking
her
head
and
her
emphatic
little
forefinger
at
her
burden
sit
there
till
i
come
back
you
dare
to
move
out
of
your
corner
for
a
single
instant
while
gone
and
i
know
the
reason
why
with
this
admonition
she
blew
her
work
candles
out
leaving
him
to
the
light
of
the
fire
and
taking
her
big
in
her
pocket
and
her
in
her
hand
marched
off
eugene
lounged
slowly
towards
the
temple
smoking
his
cigar
but
saw
no
more
of
the
dolls
dressmaker
through
the
accident
of
their
taking
opposite
sides
of
the
street
he
lounged
along
moodily
and
stopped
at
charing
cross
to
look
about
him
with
as
little
interest
in
the
crowd
as
any
man
might
take
and
was
lounging
on
again
when
a
most
unexpected
object
caught
his
eyes
no
less
an
object
than
jenny
wren
bad
boy
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
to
cross
the
road
a
more
ridiculous
and
feeble
spectacle
than
this
tottering
wretch
making
unsteady
sallies
into
the
roadway
and
as
often
staggering
back
again
oppressed
by
terrors
of
vehicles
that
were
a
long
way
off
or
were
nowhere
the
streets
could
not
have
shown
over
and
over
again
when
the
course
was
perfectly
clear
he
set
out
got
half
way
described
a
loop
turned
and
went
back
again
when
he
might
have
crossed
and
half
a
dozen
times
then
he
would
stand
shivering
on
the
edge
of
the
pavement
looking
up
the
street
and
looking
down
while
scores
of
people
jostled
him
and
crossed
and
went
on
stimulated
in
course
of
time
by
the
sight
of
so
many
successes
he
would
make
another
sally
make
another
loop
would
all
but
have
his
foot
on
the
opposite
pavement
would
see
or
imagine
something
coming
and
would
stagger
back
again
there
he
would
stand
making
spasmodic
preparations
as
if
for
a
great
leap
and
at
last
would
decide
on
a
start
at
precisely
the
wrong
moment
and
would
be
roared
at
by
drivers
and
would
shrink
back
once
more
and
stand
in
the
old
spot
shivering
with
the
whole
of
the
proceedings
to
go
through
again
strikes
me
remarked
eugene
coolly
after
watching
him
for
some
minutes
my
friend
is
likely
to
be
rather
behind
time
if
he
has
any
appointment
on
hand
with
which
remark
he
strolled
on
and
took
no
further
thought
of
him
lightwood
was
at
home
when
he
got
to
the
chambers
and
had
dined
alone
there
eugene
drew
a
chair
to
the
fire
by
which
he
was
having
his
wine
and
reading
the
evening
paper
and
brought
a
glass
and
filled
it
for
good
fellowship
sake
dear
mortimer
you
are
the
express
picture
of
contented
industry
reposing
on
credit
after
the
virtuous
labours
of
the
day
dear
eugene
you
are
the
express
picture
of
discontented
idleness
not
reposing
at
all
where
have
you
been
have
been
replied
wrayburn
about
town
i
have
turned
up
at
the
present
juncture
with
the
intention
of
consulting
my
highly
intelligent
and
respected
solicitor
on
the
position
of
my
affairs
highly
intelligent
and
respect
solicitor
is
of
opinion
that
your
affairs
are
in
a
bad
way
eugene
whether
said
eugene
thoughtfully
can
be
intelligently
said
now
of
the
affairs
of
a
client
who
has
nothing
to
lose
and
who
can
not
possibly
be
made
to
pay
may
be
open
to
question
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
jews
eugene
dear
boy
returned
the
debtor
very
composedly
taking
up
his
glass
previously
fallen
into
the
hands
of
some
of
the
christians
i
can
bear
it
with
philosophy
have
had
an
interview
eugene
with
a
jew
who
seems
determined
to
press
us
hard
quite
a
shylock
and
quite
a
patriarch
a
picturesque
and
old
jew
in
a
and
gaberdine
said
eugene
pausing
in
setting
down
his
glass
not
my
worthy
friend
mr
aaron
calls
himself
mr
riah
said
eugene
comes
into
my
mind
that
no
doubt
with
an
instinctive
desire
to
receive
him
into
the
bosom
of
our
church
i
gave
him
the
name
of
aaron
eugene
returned
lightwood
are
more
ridiculous
than
usual
say
what
you
mean
my
dear
fellow
that
i
have
the
honour
and
pleasure
of
a
speaking
acquaintance
with
such
a
patriarch
as
you
describe
and
that
i
address
him
as
mr
aaron
because
it
appears
to
me
hebraic
expressive
appropriate
and
complimentary
notwithstanding
which
strong
reasons
for
its
being
his
name
it
may
not
be
his
name
believe
you
are
the
absurdest
man
on
the
face
of
the
earth
said
lightwood
laughing
at
all
i
assure
you
did
he
mention
that
he
knew
me
did
not
he
only
said
of
you
that
he
expected
to
be
paid
by
you
looks
remarked
eugene
with
much
gravity
not
knowing
me
i
hope
it
may
not
be
my
worthy
friend
mr
aaron
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
mortimer
i
doubt
he
may
have
a
prepossession
against
me
i
strongly
suspect
him
of
having
had
a
hand
in
spiriting
away
lizzie
returned
lightwood
impatiently
by
a
fatality
to
bring
us
round
to
lizzie
about
town
meant
about
lizzie
just
now
eugene
solicitor
do
you
know
observed
eugene
turning
round
to
the
furniture
a
man
of
infinite
discernment
it
not
eugene
it
did
mortimer
yet
eugene
you
know
you
do
not
really
care
for
her
eugene
wrayburn
rose
and
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
stood
with
a
foot
on
the
fender
indolently
rocking
his
body
and
looking
at
the
fire
after
a
prolonged
pause
he
replied
do
know
that
i
must
ask
you
not
to
say
that
as
if
we
took
it
for
granted
if
you
do
care
for
her
so
much
the
more
should
you
leave
her
to
herself
having
again
paused
as
before
eugene
said
do
know
that
either
but
tell
me
did
you
ever
see
me
take
so
much
trouble
about
anything
as
about
this
disappearance
of
hers
i
ask
for
information
dear
eugene
i
wish
i
ever
had
you
have
not
just
so
you
confirm
my
own
impression
does
that
look
as
if
i
cared
for
her
i
ask
for
information
asked
you
for
information
eugene
said
mortimer
reproachfully
boy
i
know
it
but
i
ca
give
it
i
thirst
for
information
what
do
i
mean
if
my
taking
so
much
trouble
to
recover
her
does
not
mean
that
i
care
for
her
what
does
it
mean
if
peter
piper
picked
a
peck
of
pickled
pepper
where
the
peck
though
he
said
this
gaily
he
said
it
with
a
perplexed
and
inquisitive
face
as
if
he
actually
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
himself
on
to
the
end
lightwood
was
beginning
to
remonstrate
when
he
caught
at
the
words
see
now
that
exactly
what
i
am
incapable
of
doing
how
very
acute
you
are
mortimer
in
finding
my
weak
place
when
we
were
at
school
together
i
got
up
my
lessons
at
the
last
moment
day
by
day
and
bit
by
bit
now
we
are
out
in
life
together
i
get
up
my
lessons
in
the
same
way
in
the
present
task
i
have
not
got
beyond
this
i
am
bent
on
finding
lizzie
and
i
mean
to
find
her
and
i
will
take
any
means
of
finding
her
that
offer
themselves
fair
means
or
foul
means
are
all
alike
to
me
i
ask
you
for
information
what
does
that
mean
when
i
have
found
her
i
may
ask
you
also
for
information
what
do
i
mean
now
but
it
would
be
premature
in
this
stage
and
it
not
the
character
of
my
mind
lightwood
was
shaking
his
head
over
the
air
with
which
his
friend
held
forth
thus
an
air
so
whimsically
open
and
argumentative
as
almost
to
deprive
what
he
said
of
the
appearance
of
evasion
when
a
shuffling
was
heard
at
the
outer
door
and
then
an
undecided
knock
as
though
some
hand
were
groping
for
the
knocker
frolicsome
youth
of
the
neighbourhood
said
eugene
i
should
be
delighted
to
pitch
from
this
elevation
into
the
churchyard
below
without
any
intermediate
ceremonies
have
probably
turned
the
lamp
out
i
am
on
duty
and
will
see
to
the
door
his
friend
had
barely
had
time
to
recall
the
unprecedented
gleam
of
determination
with
which
he
had
spoken
of
finding
this
girl
and
which
had
faded
out
of
him
with
the
breath
of
the
spoken
words
when
eugene
came
back
ushering
in
a
most
disgraceful
shadow
of
a
man
shaking
from
head
to
foot
and
clothed
in
shabby
grease
and
smear
interesting
gentleman
said
eugene
the
son
the
occasionally
rather
trying
son
for
he
has
his
failings
of
a
lady
of
my
acquaintance
my
dear
mortimer
mr
dolls
eugene
had
no
idea
what
his
name
was
knowing
the
little
dressmaker
to
be
assumed
but
presented
him
with
easy
confidence
under
the
first
appellation
that
his
associations
suggested
gather
my
dear
mortimer
pursued
eugene
as
lightwood
stared
at
the
obscene
visitor
the
manner
of
mr
dolls
which
is
occasionally
complicated
that
he
desires
to
make
some
communication
to
me
i
have
mentioned
to
mr
dolls
that
you
and
i
are
on
terms
of
confidence
and
have
requested
mr
dolls
to
develop
his
views
here
the
wretched
object
being
much
embarrassed
by
holding
what
remained
of
his
hat
eugene
airily
tossed
it
to
the
door
and
put
him
down
in
a
chair
will
be
necessary
i
think
he
observed
wind
up
mr
dolls
before
anything
to
any
mortal
purpose
can
be
got
out
of
him
brandy
mr
dolls
or
rum
said
mr
dolls
a
judiciously
small
quantity
of
the
spirit
was
given
him
in
a
and
he
began
to
convey
it
to
his
mouth
with
all
kinds
of
falterings
and
gyrations
on
the
road
nerves
of
mr
dolls
remarked
eugene
to
lightwood
considerably
unstrung
and
i
deem
it
on
the
whole
expedient
to
fumigate
mr
dolls
he
took
the
shovel
from
the
grate
sprinkled
a
few
live
ashes
on
it
and
from
a
box
on
the
took
a
few
pastiles
which
he
set
upon
them
then
with
great
composure
began
placidly
waving
the
shovel
in
front
of
mr
dolls
to
cut
him
off
from
his
company
bless
my
soul
eugene
cried
lightwood
laughing
again
a
mad
fellow
you
are
why
does
this
creature
come
to
see
you
shall
hear
said
wrayburn
very
observant
of
his
face
withal
then
speak
out
do
be
afraid
state
your
business
dolls
wrayburn
said
the
visitor
thickly
and
huskily
is
mist
wrayburn
ai
with
a
stupid
stare
course
it
is
look
at
me
what
do
you
want
mr
dolls
collapsed
in
his
chair
and
faintly
said
rum
you
do
me
the
favour
my
dear
mortimer
to
wind
up
mr
dolls
again
said
eugene
am
occupied
with
the
fumigation
a
similar
quantity
was
poured
into
his
glass
and
he
got
it
to
his
lips
by
similar
circuitous
ways
having
drunk
it
mr
dolls
with
an
evident
fear
of
running
down
again
unless
he
made
haste
proceeded
to
business
wrayburn
tried
to
nudge
you
but
you
would
you
want
that
drection
you
want
where
she
lives
do
you
mist
wrayburn
with
a
glance
at
his
friend
eugene
replied
to
the
question
sternly
do
am
er
man
said
mr
dolls
trying
to
smite
himself
on
the
breast
but
bringing
his
hand
to
bear
upon
the
vicinity
of
his
eye
do
it
i
am
er
man
er
do
it
are
you
the
man
to
do
demanded
eugene
still
sternly
give
up
that
drection
you
got
it
with
a
most
laborious
attempt
at
pride
and
dignity
mr
dolls
rolled
his
head
for
some
time
awakening
the
highest
expectations
and
then
answered
as
if
it
were
the
happiest
point
that
could
possibly
be
expected
of
him
do
you
mean
then
mr
dolls
collapsing
in
the
drowsiest
manner
after
his
late
intellectual
triumph
replied
rum
him
up
again
my
dear
mortimer
said
wrayburn
him
up
again
eugene
urged
lightwood
in
a
low
voice
as
he
complied
you
stoop
to
the
use
of
such
an
instrument
as
this
said
was
the
reply
made
with
that
former
gleam
of
determination
i
would
find
her
out
by
any
means
fair
or
foul
these
are
foul
and
i
take
them
if
i
am
not
first
tempted
to
break
the
head
of
mr
dolls
with
the
fumigator
can
you
get
the
direction
do
you
mean
that
speak
if
that
what
you
have
come
for
say
how
much
you
want
shillings
rum
said
mr
dolls
shall
have
it
shillings
rum
said
mr
dolls
making
an
attempt
to
stiffen
himself

rejoined
eugene
tapping
his
palsied
head
with
the
as
it
sank
on
his
breast
comes
next
making
a
dignified
attempt
to
gather
himself
together
but
as
it
were
dropping
half
a
dozen
pieces
of
himself
while
he
tried
in
vain
to
pick
up
one
mr
dolls
swaying
his
head
from
side
to
side
regarded
his
questioner
with
what
he
supposed
to
be
a
haughty
smile
and
a
scornful
glance
looks
upon
me
as
mere
child

then
said
eugene
adding
very
heartily
under
his
breath
you
brute
get
it
and
bring
it
here
to
me
and
earn
the
money
for
sixty
of
rum
and
drink
them
all
one
a
top
of
another
and
drink
yourself
dead
with
all
possible
expedition
the
latter
clauses
of
these
special
instructions
he
addressed
to
the
fire
as
he
gave
it
back
the
ashes
he
had
taken
from
it
and
replaced
the
shovel
mr
dolls
now
struck
out
the
highly
unexpected
discovery
that
he
had
been
insulted
by
lightwood
and
stated
his
desire
to
it
out
with
on
the
spot
and
defied
him
to
come
on
upon
the
liberal
terms
of
a
sovereign
to
a
halfpenny
mr
dolls
then
fell
a
crying
and
then
exhibited
a
tendency
to
fall
asleep
this
last
manifestation
as
by
far
the
most
alarming
by
reason
of
its
threatening
his
prolonged
stay
on
the
premises
necessitated
vigorous
measures
eugene
picked
up
his
hat
with
the
tongs
clapped
it
on
his
head
and
taking
him
by
the
collar
all
this
at
arm
length
conducted
him
down
stairs
and
out
of
the
precincts
into
fleet
street
there
he
turned
his
face
westward
and
left
him
when
he
got
back
lightwood
was
standing
over
the
fire
brooding
in
a
sufficiently
manner
wash
my
hands
of
mr
dolls
physically
said
eugene
be
with
you
again
directly
mortimer
would
much
prefer
retorted
mortimer
washing
your
hands
of
mr
dolls
morally
eugene
would
i
said
eugene
you
see
dear
boy
i
ca
do
without
him
in
a
minute
or
two
he
resumed
his
chair
as
perfectly
unconcerned
as
usual
and
rallied
his
friend
on
having
so
narrowly
escaped
the
prowess
of
their
muscular
visitor
ca
be
amused
on
this
theme
said
mortimer
restlessly
can
make
almost
any
theme
amusing
to
me
eugene
but
not
this
cried
eugene
am
a
little
ashamed
of
it
myself
and
therefore
let
us
change
the
subject
is
so
deplorably
underhanded
said
mortimer
is
so
unworthy
of
you
this
setting
on
of
such
a
shameful
scout
have
changed
the
subject
exclaimed
eugene
airily
have
found
a
new
one
in
that
word
scout
do
be
like
patience
on
a
mantelpiece
frowning
at
dolls
but
sit
down
and
i
tell
you
something
that
you
really
will
find
amusing
take
a
cigar
look
at
this
of
mine
i
light
it
draw
one
puff
breathe
the
smoke
out
there
it
goes
dolls
it
gone
and
being
gone
you
are
a
man
again
subject
said
mortimer
after
lighting
a
cigar
and
comforting
himself
with
a
whiff
or
two
scouts
eugene
is
it
droll
that
i
never
go
out
after
dark
but
i
find
myself
attended
always
by
one
scout
and
often
by
two
lightwood
took
his
cigar
from
his
lips
in
surprise
and
looked
at
his
friend
as
if
with
a
latent
suspicion
that
there
must
be
a
jest
or
hidden
meaning
in
his
words
my
honour
no
said
wrayburn
answering
the
look
and
smiling
carelessly
do
wonder
at
your
supposing
so
but
on
my
honour
no
i
say
what
i
mean
i
never
go
out
after
dark
but
i
find
myself
in
the
ludicrous
situation
of
being
followed
and
observed
at
a
distance
always
by
one
scout
and
often
by
two
you
sure
eugene
my
dear
boy
they
are
always
the
same
there
no
process
out
against
you
the
jews
only
threaten
they
have
done
nothing
besides
they
know
where
to
find
you
and
i
represent
you
why
take
the
trouble
the
legal
mind
remarked
eugene
turning
round
to
the
furniture
again
with
an
air
of
indolent
rapture
the
hand
assimilating
itself
to
what
it
works
in
or
would
work
in
if
anybody
would
give
it
anything
to
do
respected
solicitor
it
not
that
the
schoolmaster
abroad
schoolmaster
sometimes
the
schoolmaster
and
the
pupil
are
both
abroad
why
how
soon
you
rust
in
my
absence
you
do
understand
yet
those
fellows
who
were
here
one
night
they
are
the
scouts
i
speak
of
as
doing
me
the
honour
to
attend
me
after
dark
long
has
this
been
going
on
asked
lightwood
opposing
a
serious
face
to
the
laugh
of
his
friend
apprehend
it
has
been
going
on
ever
since
a
certain
person
went
off
probably
it
had
been
going
on
some
little
time
before
i
noticed
it
which
would
bring
it
to
about
that
time
you
think
they
suppose
you
to
have
inveigled
her
away
dear
mortimer
you
know
the
absorbing
nature
of
my
professional
occupations
i
really
have
not
had
leisure
to
think
about
it
you
asked
them
what
they
want
have
you
objected
should
i
ask
them
what
they
want
dear
fellow
when
i
am
indifferent
what
they
want
why
should
i
express
objection
when
i
object
are
in
your
most
reckless
mood
but
you
called
the
situation
just
now
a
ludicrous
one
and
most
men
object
to
that
even
those
who
are
utterly
indifferent
to
everything
else
charm
me
mortimer
with
your
reading
of
my
weaknesses
that
very
word
reading
in
its
critical
use
always
charms
me
an
actress
reading
of
a
chambermaid
a
dancer
reading
of
a
hornpipe
a
singer
reading
of
a
song
a
marine
painter
reading
of
the
sea
the
reading
of
an
instrumental
passage
are
phrases
ever
youthful
and
delightful
i
was
mentioning
your
perception
of
my
weaknesses
i
own
to
the
weakness
of
objecting
to
occupy
a
ludicrous
position
and
therefore
i
transfer
the
position
to
the
scouts
wish
eugene
you
would
speak
a
little
more
soberly
and
plainly
if
it
were
only
out
of
consideration
for
my
feeling
less
at
ease
than
you
do
soberly
and
plainly
mortimer
i
goad
the
schoolmaster
to
madness
i
make
the
schoolmaster
so
ridiculous
and
so
aware
of
being
made
ridiculous
that
i
see
him
chafe
and
fret
at
every
pore
when
we
cross
one
another
the
amiable
occupation
has
been
the
solace
of
my
life
since
i
was
baulked
in
the
manner
unnecessary
to
recall
i
have
derived
inexpressible
comfort
from
it
i
do
it
thus
i
stroll
out
after
dark
stroll
a
little
way
look
in
at
a
window
and
furtively
look
out
for
the
schoolmaster
sooner
or
later
i
perceive
the
schoolmaster
on
the
watch
sometimes
accompanied
by
his
hopeful
pupil
oftener
having
made
sure
of
his
watching
me
i
tempt
him
on
all
over
london
one
night
i
go
east
another
night
north
in
a
few
nights
i
go
all
round
the
compass
sometimes
i
walk
sometimes
i
proceed
in
cabs
draining
the
pocket
of
the
schoolmaster
who
then
follows
in
cabs
i
study
and
get
up
abstruse
no
thoroughfares
in
the
course
of
the
day
with
venetian
mystery
i
seek
those
no
thoroughfares
at
night
glide
into
them
by
means
of
dark
courts
tempt
the
schoolmaster
to
follow
turn
suddenly
and
catch
him
before
he
can
retreat
then
we
face
one
another
and
i
pass
him
as
unaware
of
his
existence
and
he
undergoes
grinding
torments
similarly
i
walk
at
a
great
pace
down
a
short
street
rapidly
turn
the
corner
and
getting
out
of
his
view
as
rapidly
turn
back
i
catch
him
coming
on
post
again
pass
him
as
unaware
of
his
existence
and
again
he
undergoes
grinding
torments
night
after
night
his
disappointment
is
acute
but
hope
springs
eternal
in
the
scholastic
breast
and
he
follows
me
again
thus
i
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
and
derive
great
benefit
from
the
healthful
exercise
when
i
do
not
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
for
anything
i
know
he
watches
at
the
temple
gate
all
night
is
an
extraordinary
story
observed
lightwood
who
had
heard
it
out
with
serious
attention
do
like
it
are
a
little
hipped
dear
fellow
said
eugene
have
been
too
sedentary
come
and
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
you
mean
that
you
believe
he
is
watching
now
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
he
is
you
seen
him
forgot
to
look
for
him
when
i
was
last
out
returned
eugene
with
the
calmest
indifference
i
dare
say
he
was
there
come
be
a
british
sportsman
and
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
it
will
do
you
good
lightwood
hesitated
but
yielding
to
his
curiosity
rose
cried
eugene
rising
too
if
yoicks
would
be
in
better
keeping
consider
that
i
said
yoicks
look
to
your
feet
mortimer
for
we
shall
try
your
boots
when
you
are
ready
i
am
need
i
say
with
a
hey
ho
chivey
and
likewise
with
a
hark
forward
hark
forward
tantivy
nothing
make
you
serious
said
mortimer
laughing
through
his
gravity
am
always
serious
but
just
now
i
am
a
little
excited
by
the
glorious
fact
that
a
southerly
wind
and
a
cloudy
sky
proclaim
a
hunting
evening
ready
so
we
turn
out
the
lamp
and
shut
the
door
and
take
the
field
as
the
two
friends
passed
out
of
the
temple
into
the
public
street
eugene
demanded
with
a
show
of
courteous
patronage
in
which
direction
mortimer
would
you
like
the
run
to
be
is
a
rather
difficult
country
about
bethnal
green
said
eugene
we
have
not
taken
in
that
direction
lately
what
is
your
opinion
of
bethnal
green
mortimer
assented
to
bethnal
green
and
they
turned
eastward
when
we
come
to
st
paul
churchyard
pursued
eugene
loiter
artfully
and
i
show
you
the
schoolmaster
but
they
both
saw
him
before
they
got
there
alone
and
stealing
after
them
in
the
shadow
of
the
houses
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
your
wind
said
eugene
i
am
off
directly
does
it
occur
to
you
that
the
boys
of
merry
england
will
begin
to
deteriorate
in
an
educational
light
if
this
lasts
long
the
schoolmaster
ca
attend
to
me
and
the
boys
too
got
your
wind
i
am
off
at
what
a
rate
he
went
to
breathe
the
schoolmaster
and
how
he
then
lounged
and
loitered
to
put
his
patience
to
another
kind
of
wear
what
preposterous
ways
he
took
with
no
other
object
on
earth
than
to
disappoint
and
punish
him
and
how
he
wore
him
out
by
every
piece
of
ingenuity
that
his
eccentric
humour
could
devise
all
this
lightwood
noted
with
a
feeling
of
astonishment
that
so
careless
a
man
could
be
so
wary
and
that
so
idle
a
man
could
take
so
much
trouble
at
last
far
on
in
the
third
hour
of
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
when
he
had
brought
the
poor
dogging
wretch
round
again
into
the
city
he
twisted
mortimer
up
a
few
dark
entries
twisted
him
into
a
little
square
court
twisted
him
sharp
round
again
and
they
almost
ran
against
bradley
headstone
you
see
as
i
was
saying
mortimer
remarked
eugene
aloud
with
the
utmost
coolness
as
though
there
were
no
one
within
hearing
by
themselves
you
see
as
i
was
saying
undergoing
grinding
torments
it
was
not
too
strong
a
phrase
for
the
occasion
looking
like
the
hunted
and
not
the
hunter
baffled
worn
with
the
exhaustion
of
deferred
hope
and
consuming
hate
and
anger
in
his
face
seamed
with
jealousy
and
anger
and
torturing
himself
with
the
conviction
that
he
showed
it
all
and
they
exulted
in
it
he
went
by
them
in
the
dark
like
a
haggard
head
suspended
in
the
air
so
completely
did
the
force
of
his
expression
cancel
his
figure
mortimer
lightwood
was
not
an
extraordinarily
impressible
man
but
this
face
impressed
him
he
spoke
of
it
more
than
once
on
the
remainder
of
the
way
home
and
more
than
once
when
they
got
home
they
had
been
abed
in
their
respective
rooms
two
or
three
hours
when
eugene
was
partly
awakened
by
hearing
a
footstep
going
about
and
was
fully
awakened
by
seeing
lightwood
standing
at
his
bedside
wrong
mortimer
fancy
takes
you
then
for
walking
about
in
the
night
am
horribly
wakeful
comes
that
about
i
wonder
i
can
not
lose
sight
of
that
fellow
face
said
eugene
with
a
light
laugh
can
and
turned
over
and
fell
asleep
again
chapter
in
the
dark
there
was
no
sleep
for
bradley
headstone
on
that
night
when
eugene
wrayburn
turned
so
easily
in
his
bed
there
was
no
sleep
for
little
miss
peecher
bradley
consumed
the
lonely
hours
and
consumed
himself
in
haunting
the
spot
where
his
careless
rival
lay
a
dreaming
little
miss
peecher
wore
them
away
in
listening
for
the
return
home
of
the
master
of
her
heart
and
in
sorrowfully
presaging
that
much
was
amiss
with
him
yet
more
was
amiss
with
him
than
miss
peecher
simply
arranged
little
of
thoughts
fitted
with
no
gloomy
and
dark
recesses
could
hold
for
the
state
of
the
man
was
murderous
the
state
of
the
man
was
murderous
and
he
knew
it
more
he
irritated
it
with
a
kind
of
perverse
pleasure
akin
to
that
which
a
sick
man
sometimes
has
in
irritating
a
wound
upon
his
body
tied
up
all
day
with
his
disciplined
show
upon
him
subdued
to
the
performance
of
his
routine
of
educational
tricks
encircled
by
a
gabbling
crowd
he
broke
loose
at
night
like
an
wild
animal
under
his
daily
restraint
it
was
his
compensation
not
his
trouble
to
give
a
glance
towards
his
state
at
night
and
to
the
freedom
of
its
being
indulged
if
great
criminals
told
the
truth
which
being
great
criminals
they
do
not
they
would
very
rarely
tell
of
their
struggles
against
the
crime
their
struggles
are
towards
it
they
buffet
with
opposing
waves
to
gain
the
bloody
shore
not
to
recede
from
it
this
man
perfectly
comprehended
that
he
hated
his
rival
with
his
strongest
and
worst
forces
and
that
if
he
tracked
him
to
lizzie
hexam
his
so
doing
would
never
serve
himself
with
her
or
serve
her
all
his
pains
were
taken
to
the
end
that
he
might
incense
himself
with
the
sight
of
the
detested
figure
in
her
company
and
favour
in
her
place
of
concealment
and
he
knew
as
well
what
act
of
his
would
follow
if
he
did
as
he
knew
that
his
mother
had
borne
him
granted
that
he
may
not
have
held
it
necessary
to
make
express
mention
to
himself
of
the
one
familiar
truth
any
more
than
of
the
other
he
knew
equally
well
that
he
fed
his
wrath
and
hatred
and
that
he
accumulated
provocation
and
by
being
made
the
nightly
sport
of
the
reckless
and
insolent
eugene
knowing
all
this
and
still
always
going
on
with
infinite
endurance
pains
and
perseverance
could
his
dark
soul
doubt
whither
he
went
baffled
exasperated
and
weary
he
lingered
opposite
the
temple
gate
when
it
closed
on
wrayburn
and
lightwood
debating
with
himself
should
he
go
home
for
that
time
or
should
he
watch
longer
possessed
in
his
jealousy
by
the
fixed
idea
that
wrayburn
was
in
the
secret
if
it
were
not
altogether
of
his
contriving
bradley
was
as
confident
of
getting
the
better
of
him
at
last
by
sullenly
sticking
to
him
as
he
would
have
been
and
often
had
been
of
mastering
any
piece
of
study
in
the
way
of
his
vocation
by
the
like
slow
persistent
process
a
man
of
rapid
passions
and
sluggish
intelligence
it
had
served
him
often
and
should
serve
him
again
the
suspicion
crossed
him
as
he
rested
in
a
doorway
with
his
eyes
upon
the
temple
gate
that
perhaps
she
was
even
concealed
in
that
set
of
chambers
it
would
furnish
another
reason
for
wrayburn
purposeless
walks
and
it
might
be
he
thought
of
it
and
thought
of
it
until
he
resolved
to
steal
up
the
stairs
if
the
gatekeeper
would
let
him
through
and
listen
so
the
haggard
head
suspended
in
the
air
flitted
across
the
road
like
the
spectre
of
one
of
the
many
heads
erst
hoisted
upon
neighbouring
temple
bar
and
stopped
before
the
watchman
the
watchman
looked
at
it
and
asked
for
wrayburn
very
late
came
back
with
mr
lightwood
i
know
near
upon
two
hours
ago
but
if
he
has
gone
to
bed
i
put
a
paper
in
his
i
am
expected
the
watchman
said
no
more
but
opened
the
gate
though
rather
doubtfully
seeing
however
that
the
visitor
went
straight
and
fast
in
the
right
direction
he
seemed
satisfied
the
haggard
head
floated
up
the
dark
staircase
and
softly
descended
nearer
to
the
floor
outside
the
outer
door
of
the
chambers
the
doors
of
the
rooms
within
appeared
to
be
standing
open
there
were
rays
of
candlelight
from
one
of
them
and
there
was
the
sound
of
a
footstep
going
about
there
were
two
voices
the
words
they
uttered
were
not
distinguishable
but
they
were
both
the
voices
of
men
in
a
few
moments
the
voices
were
silent
and
there
was
no
sound
of
footstep
and
the
inner
light
went
out
if
lightwood
could
have
seen
the
face
which
kept
him
awake
staring
and
listening
in
the
darkness
outside
the
door
as
he
spoke
of
it
he
might
have
been
less
disposed
to
sleep
through
the
remainder
of
the
night
there
said
bradley
she
might
have
been
the
head
arose
to
its
former
height
from
the
ground
floated
down
the
again
and
passed
on
to
the
gate
a
man
was
standing
there
in
parley
with
the
watchman
said
the
watchman
he
is
perceiving
himself
to
be
the
antecedent
bradley
looked
from
the
watchman
to
the
man
man
is
leaving
a
letter
for
mr
lightwood
the
watchman
explained
showing
it
in
his
hand
i
was
mentioning
that
a
person
had
just
gone
up
to
mr
lightwood
chambers
it
might
be
the
same
business
perhaps
said
bradley
glancing
at
the
man
who
was
a
stranger
to
him
the
man
assented
in
a
surly
way
letter
it
wrote
by
my
daughter
but
it
mine
is
about
my
business
and
my
business
nobody
else
business
as
bradley
passed
out
at
the
gate
with
an
undecided
foot
he
heard
it
shut
behind
him
and
heard
the
footstep
of
the
man
coming
after
him
me
said
the
man
who
appeared
to
have
been
drinking
and
rather
stumbled
at
him
than
touched
him
to
attract
his
attention
might
you
be
acquainted
with
the
governor
whom
asked
bradley
returned
the
man
pointing
backward
over
his
right
shoulder
with
his
right
thumb
governor
do
know
what
you
mean
look
here
hooking
his
proposition
on
his
fingers
with
the
forefinger
of
his
right

middle
finger

bradley
with
a
frown
and
a
distant
look
before
him
i
want
to

cried
the
man
governor
hooroar
governor

am
of
your
way
of
thinkin
make
such
a
noise
at
this
dead
hour
of
the
night
what
are
you
talking
about
here
governor
replied
the
man
becoming
hoarsely
confidential
governor
he
always
joked
his
jokes
agin
me
owing
as
i
believe
to
my
being
a
honest
man
as
gets
my
living
by
the
sweat
of
my
brow
which
he
ai
and
he
do
is
that
to
me
governor
returned
the
man
in
a
tone
of
injured
innocence
you
do
care
to
hear
no
more
do
hear
no
more
you
begun
it
you
said
and
likeways
showed
pretty
plain
as
you
war
by
no
means
friendly
to
him
but
i
do
seek
to
force
my
company
nor
yet
my
opinions
on
no
man
i
am
a
honest
man
that
what
i
am
put
me
in
the
dock
anywhere
i
do
care
where
and
i
says
my
lord
i
am
a
honest

me
in
the
anywhere
i
do
care
where
and
i
says
the
same
to
his
lordship
and
i
kisses
the
book
i
do
kiss
my
i
kisses
the
book
it
was
not
so
much
in
deference
to
these
strong
testimonials
to
character
as
in
his
restless
casting
about
for
any
way
or
help
towards
the
discovery
on
which
he
was
concentrated
that
bradley
headstone
replied
need
take
offence
i
did
mean
to
stop
you
you
were
too
loud
in
the
open
street
that
was
all
governor
replied
mr
riderhood
mollified
and
mysterious
know
wot
it
is
to
be
loud
and
i
know
wot
it
is
to
be
soft
i
do
it
would
be
a
wonder
if
i
did
not
being
by
the
name
of
roger
which
took
it
arter
my
own
father
which
took
it
from
his
own
father
though
which
of
our
fust
took
it
i
will
not
in
any
ways
mislead
you
by
undertakin
to
say
and
wishing
that
your
elth
may
be
better
than
your
looks
which
your
inside
must
be
bad
indeed
if
it
on
the
footing
of
your
out
startled
by
the
implication
that
his
face
revealed
too
much
of
his
mind
bradley
made
an
effort
to
clear
his
brow
it
might
be
worth
knowing
what
this
strange
man
business
was
with
lightwood
or
wrayburn
or
both
at
such
an
unseasonable
hour
he
set
himself
to
find
out
for
the
man
might
prove
to
be
a
messenger
between
those
two
call
at
the
temple
late
he
remarked
with
a
lumbering
show
of
ease
i
may
die
cried
mr
riderhood
with
a
hoarse
laugh
i
a
goin
to
say
the
words
to
you
governor
chanced
so
with
me
said
bradley
looking
disconcertedly
about
him
it
chanced
so
with
me
said
riderhood
i
do
mind
telling
you
how
why
should
i
mind
telling
you
i
a
deputy
up
the
river
and
i
was
off
duty
and
i
shall
be
on
and
i
come
to
london
to
look
arter
my
private
affairs
my
private
affairs
is
to
get
appinted
to
the
lock
as
keeper
at
fust
hand
and
to
have
the
law
of
a
busted
steamer
which
drownded
of
me
i
ai
a
goin
to
be
drownded
and
not
paid
for
it
bradley
looked
at
him
as
though
he
were
claiming
to
be
a
ghost
steamer
said
mr
riderhood
obstinately
me
down
and
drownded
of
me
interference
on
the
part
of
other
parties
brought
me
round
but
i
never
asked
to
bring
me
round
nor
yet
the
steamer
never
asked
to
it
i
mean
to
be
paid
for
the
life
as
the
steamer
took
that
your
business
at
mr
lightwood
chambers
in
the
middle
of
the
night
asked
bradley
eyeing
him
with
distrust
and
to
get
a
writing
to
be
lock
keeper
a
recommendation
in
writing
being
looked
for
who
else
ought
to
give
it
to
me
as
i
says
in
the
letter
in
my
daughter
hand
with
my
mark
put
to
it
to
make
it
good
in
law
who
but
you
lawyer
lightwood
ought
to
hand
over
this
here
stifficate
and
who
but
you
ought
to
go
in
for
damages
on
my
account
agin
the
steamer
for
as
i
says
under
my
mark
i
have
had
trouble
enough
along
of
you
and
your
friend
if
you
lawyer
lightwood
had
backed
me
good
and
true
and
if
the
governor
had
took
me
down
correct
i
says
under
my
mark
i
should
have
been
worth
money
at
the
present
time
instead
of
having
a
of
bad
names
chucked
at
me
and
being
forced
to
eat
my
words
which
is
a
unsatisfying
sort
of
food
wotever
a
man
appetite
and
when
you
mention
the
middle
of
the
night
governor
growled
mr
riderhood
winding
up
his
monotonous
summary
of
his
wrongs
your
eye
on
this
here
bundle
under
my
arm
and
bear
in
mind
that
i
a
walking
back
to
my
lock
and
that
the
temple
laid
upon
my
line
of
road
bradley
headstone
face
had
changed
during
this
latter
recital
and
he
had
observed
the
speaker
with
a
more
sustained
attention
you
know
said
he
after
a
pause
during
which
they
walked
on
side
by
side
i
believe
i
could
tell
you
your
name
if
i
tried
your
opinion
was
the
answer
accompanied
with
a
stop
and
a
stare
name
is
riderhood
blest
if
it
ai
returned
that
gentleman
i
do
know
quite
another
thing
said
bradley
never
supposed
you
did
as
bradley
walked
on
meditating
the
rogue
walked
on
at
his
side
muttering
the
purport
of
the
muttering
was
rogue
riderhood
by
george
seemed
to
be
made
public
property
on
now
and
that
every
man
seemed
to
think
himself
free
to
handle
his
name
as
if
it
was
a
street
pump
the
purport
of
the
meditating
was
is
an
instrument
can
i
use
it
they
had
walked
along
the
strand
and
into
pall
mall
and
had
turned
towards
hyde
park
corner
bradley
headstone
waiting
on
the
pace
and
lead
of
riderhood
and
leaving
him
to
indicate
the
course
so
slow
were
the
schoolmaster
thoughts
and
so
indistinct
his
purposes
when
they
were
but
tributary
to
the
one
absorbing
purpose
or
rather
when
like
dark
trees
under
a
stormy
sky
they
only
lined
the
long
vista
at
the
end
of
which
he
saw
those
two
figures
of
wrayburn
and
lizzie
on
which
his
eyes
were
fixed
that
at
least
a
good
was
traversed
before
he
spoke
again
even
then
it
was
only
to
ask
is
your
lock
mile
and
odd
call
it
mile
and
odd
if
you
like
up
stream
was
the
sullen
reply
is
it
called
weir
mill
lock
i
was
to
offer
you
five
shillings
what
then
then
i
take
it
said
mr
riderhood
the
schoolmaster
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
produced
two
and
placed
them
in
mr
riderhood
palm
who
stopped
at
a
convenient
doorstep
to
ring
them
both
before
acknowledging
their
receipt
one
thing
about
you
governor
said
riderhood
faring
on
again
looks
well
and
goes
fur
you
a
ready
money
man
now
when
he
had
carefully
pocketed
the
coins
on
that
side
of
himself
which
was
furthest
from
his
new
friend
this
for
you
o
course
i
know
that
said
riderhood
as
arguing
something
that
was
course
i
know
very
well
as
no
man
in
his
right
senses
would
suppose
as
anythink
would
make
me
give
it
up
agin
when
once
got
it
but
what
do
you
want
for
it
do
know
that
i
want
anything
for
it
or
if
i
do
want
anything
for
it
i
do
know
what
it
is
bradley
gave
this
answer
in
a
stolid
vacant
and
manner
which
mr
riderhood
found
very
extraordinary
have
no
goodwill
towards
this
wrayburn
said
bradley
coming
to
the
name
in
a
reluctant
and
forced
way
as
if
he
were
dragged
to
it
have
i
riderhood
nodded
and
asked
it
for
that
as
much
for
that
as
anything
else
it
something
to
be
agreed
with
on
a
subject
that
occupies
so
much
of
one
thoughts
do
agree
with
you
returned
mr
riderhood
bluntly
it
do
governor
and
it
no
use
a
lookin
as
if
you
wanted
to
make
out
that
it
did
i
tell
you
it
rankles
in
you
it
rankles
in
you
rusts
in
you
and
pisons
you
that
it
does
so
returned
bradley
with
quivering
lips
there
no
cause
for
it
enough
i
bet
a
pound
cried
mr
riderhood
you
yourself
declared
that
the
fellow
has
heaped
provocations
insults
and
affronts
on
you
or
something
to
that
effect
he
has
done
the
same
by
me
he
is
made
of
venomous
insults
and
affronts
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
sole
of
his
foot
are
you
so
hopeful
or
so
stupid
as
not
to
know
that
he
and
the
other
will
treat
your
application
with
contempt
and
light
their
cigars
with
it
should
wonder
if
they
did
by
george
said
riderhood
turning
angry
they
did
they
will
let
me
ask
you
a
question
i
know
something
more
than
your
name
about
you
i
knew
something
about
gaffer
hexam
when
did
you
last
set
eyes
upon
his
daughter
did
i
last
set
eyes
upon
his
daughter
governor
repeated
mr
riderhood
growing
intentionally
slower
of
comprehension
as
the
other
quickened
in
his
speech
not
to
speak
to
her
to
see
her
anywhere
the
rogue
had
got
the
clue
he
wanted
though
he
held
it
with
a
clumsy
hand
looking
perplexedly
at
the
passionate
face
as
if
he
were
trying
to
work
out
a
sum
in
his
mind
he
slowly
answered
ai
set
eyes
upon
her
never
once
not
since
the
day
of
death
know
her
well
by
sight
should
think
i
did
no
one
better
you
know
him
as
well
him
asked
riderhood
taking
off
his
hat
and
rubbing
his
forehead
as
he
directed
a
dull
look
at
his
questioner
the
name
is
it
so
agreeable
to
you
that
you
want
to
hear
it
again
him
said
riderhood
who
had
craftily
worked
the
schoolmaster
into
this
corner
that
he
might
again
take
note
of
his
face
under
its
evil
possession
know
him
among
a
thousand
you
bradley
tried
to
ask
it
quietly
but
do
what
he
might
with
his
voice
he
could
not
subdue
his
face
you
ever
see
them
together
the
rogue
had
got
the
clue
in
both
hands
now
see
together
governor
on
the
very
day
when
gaffer
was
towed
ashore
bradley
could
have
hidden
a
reserved
piece
of
information
from
the
sharp
eyes
of
a
whole
inquisitive
class
but
he
could
not
veil
from
the
eyes
of
the
ignorant
riderhood
the
withheld
question
next
in
his
breast
shall
put
it
plain
if
you
want
it
answered
thought
the
rogue
doggedly
ai
a
wolunteering
was
he
insolent
to
her
too
asked
bradley
after
a
struggle
did
he
make
a
show
of
being
kind
to
her
made
a
show
of
being
most
uncommon
kind
to
her
said
riderhood
george
now
i
his
flying
off
at
a
tangent
was
indisputably
natural
bradley
looked
at
him
for
the
reason
i
think
of
it
said
mr
riderhood
evasively
for
he
was
substituting
those
words
for
i
see
you
so
jealous
which
was
the
phrase
really
in
his
mind
he
went
and
took
me
down
wrong
a
purpose
on
account
o
being
sweet
upon
her
the
baseness
of
confirming
him
in
this
suspicion
or
pretence
of
one
for
he
could
not
have
really
entertained
it
was
a
line
breadth
beyond
the
mark
the
schoolmaster
had
reached
the
baseness
of
communing
and
intriguing
with
the
fellow
who
would
have
set
that
stain
upon
her
and
upon
her
brother
too
was
attained
the
line
breadth
further
lay
beyond
he
made
no
reply
but
walked
on
with
a
lowering
face
what
he
might
gain
by
this
acquaintance
he
could
not
work
out
in
his
slow
and
cumbrous
thoughts
the
man
had
an
injury
against
the
object
of
his
hatred
and
that
was
something
though
it
was
less
than
he
supposed
for
there
dwelt
in
the
man
no
such
deadly
rage
and
resentment
as
burned
in
his
own
breast
the
man
knew
her
and
might
by
a
fortunate
chance
see
her
or
hear
of
her
that
was
something
as
enlisting
one
pair
of
eyes
and
ears
the
more
the
man
was
a
bad
man
and
willing
enough
to
be
in
his
pay
that
was
something
for
his
own
state
and
purpose
were
as
bad
as
bad
could
be
and
he
seemed
to
derive
a
vague
support
from
the
possession
of
a
congenial
instrument
though
it
might
never
be
used
suddenly
he
stood
still
and
asked
riderhood
if
he
knew
where
she
was
clearly
he
did
not
know
he
asked
riderhood
if
he
would
be
willing
in
case
any
intelligence
of
her
or
of
wrayburn
as
seeking
her
or
associating
with
her
should
fall
in
his
way
to
communicate
it
if
it
were
paid
for
he
would
be
very
willing
indeed
he
was
both
he
said
with
an
oath
and
for
why
they
had
both
stood
betwixt
him
and
his
getting
his
living
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
will
not
be
long
then
said
bradley
headstone
after
some
more
discourse
to
this
effect
we
see
one
another
again
here
is
the
country
road
and
here
is
the
day
both
have
come
upon
me
by
surprise
governor
urged
mr
riderhood
do
know
where
to
find
you
is
of
no
consequence
i
know
where
to
find
you
and
i
come
to
your
lock
governor
urged
mr
riderhood
again
luck
never
come
yet
of
a
dry
acquaintance
let
wet
it
in
a
of
rum
and
milk
governor
bradley
assenting
went
with
him
into
an
early
haunted
by
unsavoury
smells
of
musty
hay
and
stale
straw
where
returning
carts
farmers
men
gaunt
dogs
fowls
of
a
beery
breed
and
certain
human
nightbirds
fluttering
home
to
roost
were
solacing
themselves
after
their
several
manners
and
where
not
one
of
the
nightbirds
hovering
about
the
sloppy
bar
failed
to
discern
at
a
glance
in
the
nightbird
with
respectable
feathers
the
worst
nightbird
of
all
an
inspiration
of
affection
for
a
carter
going
his
way
led
to
mr
riderhood
being
elevated
on
a
high
heap
of
baskets
on
a
waggon
and
pursuing
his
journey
recumbent
on
his
back
with
his
head
on
his
bundle
bradley
then
turned
to
retrace
his
steps
and
struck
off
through
ways
and
reached
school
and
home
up
came
the
sun
to
find
him
washed
and
brushed
methodically
dressed
in
decent
black
coat
and
waistcoat
decent
formal
black
tie
and
pantaloons
with
his
decent
silver
watch
in
its
pocket
and
its
decent
round
his
neck
a
scholastic
huntsman
clad
for
the
field
with
his
fresh
pack
yelping
and
barking
around
him
yet
more
really
bewitched
than
the
miserable
creatures
of
the
times
who
accused
themselves
of
impossibilities
under
a
contagion
of
horror
and
the
strongly
suggestive
influences
of
torture
he
had
been
ridden
hard
by
evil
spirits
in
the
night
that
was
newly
gone
he
had
been
spurred
and
whipped
and
heavily
sweated
if
a
record
of
the
sport
had
usurped
the
places
of
the
peaceful
texts
from
scripture
on
the
wall
the
most
advanced
of
the
scholars
might
have
taken
fright
and
run
away
from
the
master
chapter
meaning
mischief
up
came
the
sun
steaming
all
over
london
and
in
its
glorious
impartiality
even
condescending
to
make
prismatic
sparkles
in
the
whiskers
of
mr
alfred
lammle
as
he
sat
at
breakfast
in
need
of
some
brightening
from
without
was
mr
alfred
lammle
for
he
had
the
air
of
being
dull
enough
within
and
looked
grievously
discontented
mrs
alfred
lammle
faced
her
lord
the
happy
pair
of
swindlers
with
the
comfortable
tie
between
them
that
each
had
swindled
the
other
sat
moodily
observant
of
the
tablecloth
things
looked
so
gloomy
in
the
albeit
on
the
sunny
side
of
sackville
street
that
any
of
the
family
tradespeople
glancing
through
the
blinds
might
have
taken
the
hint
to
send
in
his
account
and
press
for
it
but
this
indeed
most
of
the
family
tradespeople
had
already
done
without
the
hint
seems
to
me
said
mrs
lammle
you
have
had
no
money
at
all
ever
since
we
have
been
married
seems
to
you
said
mr
lammle
have
been
the
case
may
possibly
have
been
the
case
it
does
matter
was
it
the
speciality
of
mr
and
mrs
lammle
or
does
it
ever
obtain
with
other
loving
couples
in
these
matrimonial
dialogues
they
never
addressed
each
other
but
always
some
invisible
presence
that
appeared
to
take
a
station
about
midway
between
them
perhaps
the
skeleton
in
the
cupboard
comes
out
to
be
talked
to
on
such
domestic
occasions
have
never
seen
any
money
in
the
house
said
mrs
lammle
to
the
skeleton
my
own
annuity
that
i
swear
need
take
the
trouble
of
swearing
said
mr
lammle
to
the
skeleton
more
it
does
matter
you
never
turned
your
annuity
to
so
good
an
account
an
account
in
what
way
asked
mrs
lammle
the
way
of
getting
credit
and
living
well
said
mr
lammle
perhaps
the
skeleton
laughed
scornfully
on
being
intrusted
with
this
question
and
this
answer
certainly
mrs
lammle
did
and
mr
lammle
did
what
is
to
happen
next
asked
mrs
lammle
of
the
skeleton
is
to
happen
next
said
mr
lammle
to
the
same
authority
after
this
mrs
lammle
looked
disdainfully
at
the
skeleton
but
without
carrying
the
look
on
to
mr
lammle
and
drooped
her
eyes
after
that
mr
lammle
did
exactly
the
same
thing
and
drooped
his
eyes
a
servant
then
entering
with
toast
the
skeleton
retired
into
the
closet
and
shut
itself
up
said
mr
lammle
when
the
servant
had
withdrawn
and
then
very
much
louder
to
me
if
you
please
he
eyed
her
sternly
until
she
did
attend
and
then
went
on
want
to
take
counsel
with
you
come
come
no
more
trifling
you
know
our
league
and
covenant
we
are
to
work
together
for
our
joint
interest
and
you
are
as
knowing
a
hand
as
i
am
we
be
together
if
you
were
not
what
to
be
done
we
are
hemmed
into
a
corner
what
shall
we
do
you
no
scheme
on
foot
that
will
bring
in
anything
mr
lammle
plunged
into
his
whiskers
for
reflection
and
came
out
hopeless
as
adventurers
we
are
obliged
to
play
rash
games
for
chances
of
high
winnings
and
there
has
been
a
run
of
luck
against
us
she
was
resuming
you
nothing
when
he
stopped
her
sophronia
we
we
we
we
nothing
to
sell
a
bit
i
have
given
a
jew
a
bill
of
sale
on
this
furniture
and
he
could
take
it
now
he
would
have
taken
it
before
now
i
believe
but
for
fledgeby
has
fledgeby
to
do
with
him
him
cautioned
me
against
him
before
i
got
into
his
claws
could
persuade
him
then
in
behalf
of
somebody
else
you
mean
that
fledgeby
has
at
all
softened
him
towards
you
sophronia
us
us
us
us
mean
that
the
jew
has
not
yet
done
what
he
might
have
done
and
that
fledgeby
takes
the
credit
of
having
got
him
to
hold
his
hand
you
believe
fledgeby
i
never
believe
anybody
i
never
have
my
dear
since
i
believed
you
but
it
looks
like
it
having
given
her
this
reminder
of
her
mutinous
observations
to
the
skeleton
mr
lammle
rose
from
table
perhaps
the
better
to
conceal
a
smile
and
a
white
dint
or
two
about
his
nose
and
took
a
turn
on
the
carpet
and
came
to
the
hearthrug
we
could
have
packed
the
brute
off
with
georgiana
but
however
that
spilled
milk
as
lammle
standing
gathering
up
the
skirts
of
his
with
his
back
to
the
fire
said
this
looking
down
at
his
wife
she
turned
pale
and
looked
down
at
the
ground
with
a
sense
of
disloyalty
upon
her
and
perhaps
with
a
sense
of
personal
danger
for
she
was
afraid
of
him
even
afraid
of
his
hand
and
afraid
of
his
foot
though
he
had
never
done
her
violence
she
hastened
to
put
herself
right
in
his
eyes
we
could
borrow
money
alfred
money
borrow
money
or
steal
money
it
would
be
all
one
to
us
sophronia
her
husband
struck
then
we
could
weather
this
doubt
to
offer
another
original
and
undeniable
remark
sophronia
two
and
two
make
four
but
seeing
that
she
was
turning
something
in
her
mind
he
gathered
up
the
skirts
of
his
again
and
tucking
them
under
one
arm
and
collecting
his
ample
whiskers
in
his
other
hand
kept
his
eye
upon
her
silently
is
natural
alfred
she
said
looking
up
with
some
timidity
into
his
face
think
in
such
an
emergency
of
the
richest
people
we
know
and
the
simplest
so
sophronia
boffins
so
sophronia
there
nothing
to
be
done
with
them
is
there
to
be
done
with
them
sophronia
she
cast
about
in
her
thoughts
again
and
he
kept
his
eye
upon
her
as
before
course
i
have
repeatedly
thought
of
the
boffins
sophronia
he
resumed
after
a
fruitless
silence
i
have
seen
my
way
to
nothing
they
are
well
guarded
that
infernal
secretary
stands
between
them
and
people
of
merit
he
could
be
got
rid
of
said
she
brightening
a
little
after
more
casting
about
time
sophronia
observed
her
watchful
husband
in
a
patronizing
manner
working
him
out
of
the
way
could
be
presented
in
the
light
of
a
service
to
mr
boffin
time
sophronia
have
remarked
lately
alfred
that
the
old
man
is
turning
very
suspicious
and
distrustful
too
my
dear
which
is
far
the
most
unpromising
for
us
nevertheless
take
time
sophronia
take
time
she
took
time
and
then
said
we
should
address
ourselves
to
that
tendency
in
him
of
which
we
have
made
ourselves
quite
sure
suppose
my
conscience
we
know
what
a
conscience
it
is
my
soul
yes
my
conscience
should
not
allow
me
to
keep
to
myself
any
longer
what
that
upstart
girl
told
me
of
the
secretary
having
made
a
declaration
to
her
suppose
my
conscience
should
oblige
me
to
repeat
it
to
mr
boffin
rather
like
that
said
lammle
i
so
repeated
it
to
mr
boffin
as
to
insinuate
that
my
sensitive
delicacy
and
honour
good
words
sophronia
as
to
insinuate
that
our
sensitive
delicacy
and
honour
she
resumed
with
a
bitter
stress
upon
the
phrase
not
allow
us
to
be
silent
parties
to
so
mercenary
and
designing
a
speculation
on
the
part
and
so
gross
a
breach
of
faith
towards
his
confiding
employer
suppose
i
had
imparted
my
virtuous
uneasiness
to
my
excellent
husband
and
he
had
said
in
his
integrity
sophronia
you
must
immediately
disclose
this
to
mr
more
sophronia
observed
lammle
changing
the
leg
on
which
he
stood
rather
like
that
remark
that
he
is
well
guarded
she
pursued
think
so
too
but
if
this
should
lead
to
his
discharging
his
secretary
there
would
be
a
weak
place
made
on
expounding
sophronia
i
begin
to
like
this
very
much
in
our
unimpeachable
rectitude
done
him
the
service
of
opening
his
eyes
to
the
treachery
of
the
person
he
trusted
we
shall
have
established
a
claim
upon
him
and
a
confidence
with
him
whether
it
can
be
made
much
of
or
little
of
we
must
wait
because
we
ca
help
it
to
see
probably
we
shall
make
the
most
of
it
that
is
to
be
made
said
lammle
you
think
it
impossible
she
asked
in
the
same
cold
plotting
way
you
might
replace
the
secretary
impossible
sophronia
it
might
be
brought
about
at
any
rate
it
might
be
skilfully
led
up
to
she
nodded
her
understanding
of
the
hint
as
she
looked
at
the
fire
lammle
she
said
musingly
not
without
a
slight
ironical
touch
lammle
would
be
so
delighted
to
do
anything
in
his
power
mr
lammle
himself
a
man
of
business
as
well
as
a
capitalist
mr
lammle
accustomed
to
be
intrusted
with
the
most
delicate
affairs
mr
lammle
who
has
managed
my
own
little
fortune
so
admirably
but
who
to
be
sure
began
to
make
his
reputation
with
the
advantage
of
being
a
man
of
property
above
temptation
and
beyond
suspicion
mr
lammle
smiled
and
even
patted
her
on
the
head
in
his
sinister
relish
of
the
scheme
as
he
stood
above
her
making
it
the
subject
of
his
cogitations
he
seemed
to
have
twice
as
much
nose
on
his
face
as
he
had
ever
had
in
his
life
he
stood
pondering
and
she
sat
looking
at
the
dusty
fire
without
moving
for
some
time
but
the
moment
he
began
to
speak
again
she
looked
up
with
a
wince
and
attended
to
him
as
if
that
of
hers
had
been
in
her
mind
and
the
fear
were
revived
in
her
of
his
hand
or
his
foot
appears
to
me
sophronia
that
you
have
omitted
one
branch
of
the
subject
perhaps
not
for
women
understand
women
we
might
oust
the
girl
herself
mrs
lammle
shook
her
head
has
an
immensely
strong
hold
upon
them
both
alfred
not
to
be
compared
with
that
of
a
paid
secretary
the
dear
child
said
lammle
with
a
crooked
smile
to
have
been
open
with
her
benefactor
and
benefactress
the
darling
love
ought
to
have
reposed
unbounded
confidence
in
her
benefactor
and
benefactress
sophronia
shook
her
head
again
women
understand
women
said
her
husband
rather
disappointed
do
press
it
it
might
be
the
making
of
our
fortune
to
make
a
clean
sweep
of
them
both
with
me
to
manage
the
property
and
my
wife
to
manage
the
people
whew
again
shaking
her
head
she
returned
will
never
quarrel
with
the
girl
they
will
never
punish
the
girl
we
must
accept
the
girl
rely
upon
it
cried
lammle
shrugging
his
shoulders
be
it
only
always
remember
that
we
do
want
her
the
sole
remaining
question
is
said
mrs
lammle
shall
i
begin
can
not
begin
too
soon
sophronia
as
i
have
told
you
the
condition
of
our
affairs
is
desperate
and
may
be
blown
upon
at
any
moment
must
secure
mr
boffin
alone
alfred
if
his
wife
was
present
she
would
throw
oil
upon
the
waters
i
know
i
should
fail
to
move
him
to
an
angry
outburst
if
his
wife
was
there
and
as
to
the
girl
herself
as
i
am
going
to
betray
her
confidence
she
is
equally
out
of
the
question
would
do
to
write
for
an
appointment
said
lammle
certainly
not
they
would
wonder
among
themselves
why
i
wrote
and
i
want
to
have
him
wholly
unprepared
and
ask
to
see
him
alone
suggested
lammle
would
rather
not
do
that
either
leave
it
to
me
spare
me
the
little
carriage
for
and
for
if
i
do
succeed
and
i
lie
in
wait
for
him
it
was
barely
settled
when
a
manly
form
was
seen
to
pass
the
windows
and
heard
to
knock
and
ring
fledgeby
said
lammle
admires
you
and
has
a
high
opinion
of
you
i
be
out
coax
him
to
use
his
influence
with
the
jew
his
name
is
riah
of
the
house
of
pubsey
and
adding
these
words
under
his
breath
lest
he
should
be
audible
in
the
erect
ears
of
mr
fledgeby
through
two
keyholes
and
the
hall
lammle
making
signals
of
discretion
to
his
servant
went
softly
up
stairs
fledgeby
said
mrs
lammle
giving
him
a
very
gracious
reception
glad
to
see
you
my
poor
dear
alfred
who
is
greatly
worried
just
now
about
his
affairs
went
out
rather
early
dear
mr
fledgeby
do
sit
down
dear
mr
fledgeby
did
sit
down
and
satisfied
himself
or
judging
from
the
expression
of
his
countenance
dissatisfied
himself
that
nothing
new
had
occurred
in
the
way
of
since
he
came
round
the
corner
from
the
albany
mr
fledgeby
it
was
needless
to
mention
to
you
that
my
poor
dear
alfred
is
much
worried
about
his
affairs
at
present
for
he
has
told
me
what
a
comfort
you
are
to
him
in
his
temporary
difficulties
and
what
a
great
service
you
have
rendered
him
said
mr
fledgeby
said
mrs
lammle
did
know
remarked
mr
fledgeby
trying
a
new
part
of
his
chair
that
lammle
might
be
reserved
about
his
affairs
to
me
said
mrs
lammle
with
deep
feeling
indeed
said
fledgeby
to
me
dear
mr
fledgeby
i
am
his
wife
i
i
always
understood
so
said
mr
fledgeby
as
the
wife
of
alfred
may
i
dear
mr
fledgeby
wholly
without
his
authority
or
knowledge
as
i
am
sure
your
discernment
will
perceive
entreat
you
to
continue
that
great
service
and
once
more
use
your
influence
with
mr
riah
for
a
little
more
indulgence
the
name
i
have
heard
alfred
mention
tossing
in
his
dreams
is
riah
is
it
not
name
of
the
creditor
is
riah
said
mr
fledgeby
with
a
rather
uncompromising
accent
on
his
mary
axe
pubsey
and
yes
exclaimed
mrs
lammle
clasping
her
hands
with
a
certain
gushing
wildness
and
pleading
of
the
feminine
mr
fledgeby
began
and
there
stuck
so
long
for
a
word
to
get
on
with
that
mrs
lammle
offered
him
sweetly
said
mr
fledgeby
is
ever
what
a
man
is
bound
to
listen
to
and
i
wish
it
rested
with
myself
but
this
riah
is
a
nasty
one
mrs
lammle
he
really
is
if
you
speak
to
him
dear
mr
fledgeby
my
soul
and
body
he
is
said
fledgeby
try
once
more
dearest
mr
fledgeby
what
is
there
you
can
not
do
if
you
will
you
said
fledgeby
very
complimentary
to
say
so
i
do
mind
trying
him
again
at
your
request
but
of
course
i
answer
for
the
consequences
riah
is
a
tough
subject
and
when
he
says
he
do
a
thing
he
do
it
so
cried
mrs
lammle
when
he
says
to
you
he
wait
he
wait
is
a
devilish
clever
woman
thought
fledgeby
did
see
that
opening
but
she
spies
it
out
and
cuts
into
it
as
soon
as
it
made
point
of
fact
dear
mr
fledgeby
mrs
lammle
went
on
in
a
very
interesting
manner
to
affect
concealment
of
alfred
hopes
to
you
who
are
so
much
his
friend
there
is
a
distant
break
in
his
horizon
this
figure
of
speech
seemed
rather
mysterious
to
fascination
fledgeby
who
said
a
what
in
his
eh
dear
mr
fledgeby
discussed
with
me
this
very
morning
before
he
went
out
some
prospects
he
has
which
might
entirely
change
the
aspect
of
his
present
troubles
said
fledgeby
yes
here
mrs
lammle
brought
her
handkerchief
into
play
you
know
dear
mr
fledgeby
you
who
study
the
human
heart
and
study
the
world
what
an
affliction
it
would
be
to
lose
position
and
to
lose
credit
when
ability
to
tide
over
a
very
short
time
might
save
all
appearances
said
fledgeby
you
think
mrs
lammle
that
if
lammle
got
time
he
would
burst
up
to
use
an
expression
mr
fledgeby
apologetically
explained
is
adopted
in
the
money
market
yes
truly
truly
yes
makes
all
the
difference
said
fledgeby
make
a
point
of
seeing
riah
at
once
on
you
dearest
mr
fledgeby
at
all
said
fledgeby
she
gave
him
her
hand
hand
said
mr
fledgeby
a
lovely
and
female
is
ever
the
repayment
of
a
action
said
mrs
lammle
extremely
anxious
to
get
rid
of
him
was
what
i
was
going
to
say
returned
fledgeby
who
never
would
under
any
circumstances
accept
a
suggested
expression
you
very
complimentary
may
i
imprint
a
a
one
upon
it
good
morning
may
depend
upon
your
promptitude
dearest
mr
fledgeby
said
fledgeby
looking
back
at
the
door
and
respectfully
kissing
his
hand
may
depend
upon
it
in
fact
mr
fledgeby
sped
on
his
errand
of
mercy
through
the
streets
at
so
brisk
a
rate
that
his
feet
might
have
been
winged
by
all
the
good
spirits
that
wait
on
generosity
they
might
have
taken
up
their
station
in
his
breast
too
for
he
was
blithe
and
merry
there
was
quite
a
fresh
trill
in
his
voice
when
arriving
at
the
in
st
mary
axe
and
finding
it
for
the
moment
empty
he
trolled
forth
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
judah
what
are
you
up
to
there
the
old
man
appeared
with
his
accustomed
deference
said
fledgeby
falling
back
with
a
wink
mean
mischief
jerusalem
the
old
man
raised
his
eyes
inquiringly
you
do
said
fledgeby
you
sinner
oh

dodger
what
you
going
to
act
upon
that
bill
of
sale

you
nothing

turn
you
wo

you
wo
be
put
off
for
another
single
minute
wo
you
ordered
to
immediate
action
by
the
master
tone
and
look
the
old
man
took
up
his
hat
from
the
little
counter
where
it
lay
have
been
told
that
he
might
pull
through
it
if
you
did
go
in
to
win
have
you
said
fledgeby
it
not
your
game
that
he
should
pull
through
it
ai
it
you
having
got
security
and
there
being
enough
to
pay
you
oh
you
jew
the
old
man
stood
irresolute
and
uncertain
for
a
moment
as
if
there
might
be
further
instructions
for
him
in
reserve
i
go
sir
he
at
length
asked
in
a
low
voice
me
if
he
is
going
exclaimed
fledgeby
me
as
if
he
know
his
own
purpose
asks
me
as
if
he
had
got
his
hat
on
ready
asks
me
as
if
his
sharp
old
eye
why
it
cuts
like
a
knife
looking
at
his
by
the
door
i
go

fledgeby
you
do
go
toddle

chapter
give
a
dog
a
bad
name
and
hang
him
fascination
fledgeby
left
alone
in
the
strolled
about
with
his
hat
on
one
side
whistling
and
investigating
the
drawers
and
prying
here
and
there
for
any
small
evidences
of
his
being
cheated
but
could
find
none
his
merit
that
he
do
cheat
me
was
mr
fledgeby
commentary
delivered
with
a
wink
my
precaution
he
then
with
a
lazy
grandeur
asserted
his
rights
as
lord
of
pubsey
and
by
poking
his
cane
at
the
stools
and
boxes
and
spitting
in
the
fireplace
and
so
loitered
royally
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
narrow
street
with
his
small
eyes
just
peering
over
the
top
of
pubsey
and
blind
as
a
blind
in
more
senses
than
one
it
reminded
him
that
he
was
alone
in
the
with
the
front
door
open
he
was
moving
away
to
shut
it
lest
he
should
be
injudiciously
identified
with
the
establishment
when
he
was
stopped
by
some
one
coming
to
the
door
this
some
one
was
the
dolls
dressmaker
with
a
little
basket
on
her
arm
and
her
crutch
stick
in
her
hand
her
keen
eyes
had
espied
mr
fledgeby
before
mr
fledgeby
had
espied
her
and
he
was
paralysed
in
his
purpose
of
shutting
her
out
not
so
much
by
her
approaching
the
door
as
by
her
favouring
him
with
a
shower
of
nods
the
instant
he
saw
her
this
advantage
she
improved
by
hobbling
up
the
steps
with
such
despatch
that
before
mr
fledgeby
could
take
measures
for
her
finding
nobody
at
home
she
was
face
to
face
with
him
in
the
i
see
you
well
sir
said
miss
wren
riah
in
fledgeby
had
dropped
into
a
chair
in
the
attitude
of
one
waiting
wearily
suppose
he
will
be
back
soon
he
replied
has
cut
out
and
left
me
expecting
him
back
in
an
odd
way
have
i
seen
you
before
before
if
you
had
your
eyesight
replied
miss
wren
the
conditional
clause
in
an
you
were
carrying
on
some
games
up
at
the
top
of
the
house
i
remember
how
your
friend
have
more
friends
than
one
sir
i
hope
replied
miss
wren
friend
mind
said
mr
fledgeby
shutting
up
one
eye
of
your
friends
all
your
friends
are
they
pretty
tolerable
somewhat
confounded
miss
wren
parried
the
pleasantry
and
sat
down
in
a
corner
behind
the
door
with
her
basket
in
her
lap
she
said
breaking
a
long
and
patient
silence
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
i
am
used
to
find
mr
riah
at
this
time
and
so
i
generally
come
at
this
time
i
only
want
to
buy
my
poor
little
two
shillings
worth
of
waste
perhaps
you
kindly
let
me
have
it
and
i
trot
off
to
my
work
let
you
have
it
said
fledgeby
turning
his
head
towards
her
for
he
had
been
sitting
blinking
at
the
light
and
feeling
his
cheek
you
do
really
suppose
that
i
have
anything
to
do
with
the
place
or
the
business
do
you
exclaimed
miss
wren
said
that
day
you
were
the
master
old
cock
in
black
said
riah
said
why
he
say
anything
but
you
said
so
too
returned
miss
wren
at
least
you
took
on
like
the
master
and
did
contradict
him
of
his
dodges
said
mr
fledgeby
with
a
cool
and
contemptuous
shrug
made
of
dodges
he
said
to
me
come
up
to
the
top
of
the
house
sir
and
i
show
you
a
handsome
girl
but
i
shall
call
you
the
so
i
went
up
to
the
top
of
the
house
and
he
showed
me
the
handsome
girl
very
well
worth
looking
at
she
was
and
i
was
called
the
master
i
do
know
why
i
dare
say
he
do
he
loves
a
dodge
for
its
own
sake
being
added
mr
fledgeby
after
casting
about
for
an
expressive
phrase
dodgerest
of
all
the
dodgers
my
head
cried
the
dolls
dressmaker
holding
it
with
both
her
hands
as
if
it
were
cracking
ca
mean
what
you
say
can
my
little
woman
retorted
fledgeby
i
do
i
assure
you
this
repudiation
was
not
only
an
act
of
deliberate
policy
on
part
in
case
of
his
being
surprised
by
any
other
caller
but
was
also
a
retort
upon
miss
wren
for
her
and
a
pleasant
instance
of
his
humour
as
regarded
the
old
jew
has
got
a
bad
name
as
an
old
jew
and
he
is
paid
for
the
use
of
it
and
i
have
my
money
worth
out
of
him
this
was
fledgeby
habitual
reflection
in
the
way
of
business
and
it
was
sharpened
just
now
by
the
old
man
presuming
to
have
a
secret
from
him
though
of
the
secret
itself
as
annoying
somebody
else
whom
he
disliked
he
by
no
means
disapproved
miss
wren
with
a
fallen
countenance
sat
behind
the
door
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
ground
and
the
long
and
patient
silence
had
again
set
in
for
some
time
when
the
expression
of
mr
fledgeby
face
betokened
that
through
the
upper
portion
of
the
door
which
was
of
glass
he
saw
some
one
faltering
on
the
brink
of
the
presently
there
was
a
rustle
and
a
tap
and
then
some
more
rustling
and
another
tap
fledgeby
taking
no
notice
the
door
was
at
length
softly
opened
and
the
dried
face
of
a
mild
little
elderly
gentleman
looked
in
riah
said
this
visitor
very
politely
am
waiting
for
him
sir
returned
mr
fledgeby
went
out
and
left
me
here
i
expect
him
back
every
minute
perhaps
you
had
better
take
a
chair
the
gentleman
took
a
chair
and
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
as
if
he
were
in
a
melancholy
frame
of
mind
mr
fledgeby
eyed
him
aside
and
seemed
to
relish
his
attitude
fine
day
sir
remarked
fledgeby
the
little
dried
gentleman
was
so
occupied
with
his
own
depressed
reflections
that
he
did
not
notice
the
remark
until
the
sound
of
mr
fledgeby
voice
had
died
out
of
the
then
he
started
and
said
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
fear
you
spoke
to
me
said
remarked
fledgeby
a
little
louder
than
before
was
a
fine
day
beg
your
pardon
i
beg
your
pardon
yes
again
the
little
dried
gentleman
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
again
mr
fledgeby
seemed
to
enjoy
his
doing
it
when
the
gentleman
changed
his
attitude
with
a
sigh
fledgeby
spake
with
a
grin
twemlow
i
think
the
dried
gentleman
seemed
much
surprised
the
pleasure
of
dining
with
you
at
lammle
said
fledgeby
have
the
honour
of
being
a
connexion
of
yours
an
unexpected
sort
of
place
this
to
meet
in
but
one
never
knows
when
one
gets
into
the
city
what
people
one
may
knock
up
against
i
hope
you
have
your
health
and
are
enjoying
yourself
there
might
have
been
a
touch
of
impertinence
in
the
last
words
on
the
other
hand
it
might
have
been
but
the
native
grace
of
mr
manner
mr
fledgeby
sat
on
a
stool
with
a
foot
on
the
rail
of
another
stool
and
his
hat
on
mr
twemlow
had
uncovered
on
looking
in
at
the
door
and
remained
so
now
the
conscientious
twemlow
knowing
what
he
had
done
to
thwart
the
gracious
fledgeby
was
particularly
disconcerted
by
this
encounter
he
was
as
ill
at
ease
as
a
gentleman
well
could
be
he
felt
himself
bound
to
conduct
himself
stiffly
towards
fledgeby
and
he
made
him
a
distant
bow
fledgeby
made
his
small
eyes
smaller
in
taking
special
note
of
his
manner
the
dolls
dressmaker
sat
in
her
corner
behind
the
door
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
and
her
hands
folded
on
her
basket
holding
her
between
them
and
appearing
to
take
no
heed
of
anything
a
long
time
muttered
mr
fledgeby
looking
at
his
watch
time
may
you
make
it
mr
twemlow
mr
twemlow
made
it
ten
minutes
past
twelve
sir
near
as
a
toucher
assented
fledgeby
hope
mr
twemlow
your
business
here
may
be
of
a
more
agreeable
character
than
mine
you
sir
said
mr
twemlow
fledgeby
again
made
his
small
eyes
smaller
as
he
glanced
with
great
complacency
at
twemlow
who
was
timorously
tapping
the
table
with
a
folded
letter
i
know
of
mr
riah
said
fledgeby
with
a
very
disparaging
utterance
of
his
name
me
to
believe
that
this
is
about
the
shop
for
disagreeable
business
i
have
always
found
him
the
bitingest
and
tightest
screw
in
london
mr
twemlow
acknowledged
the
remark
with
a
little
distant
bow
it
evidently
made
him
nervous
much
so
pursued
fledgeby
if
it
was
to
be
true
to
a
friend
nobody
should
catch
me
waiting
here
a
single
minute
but
if
you
have
friends
in
adversity
stand
by
them
that
what
i
say
and
act
up
to
the
equitable
twemlow
felt
that
this
sentiment
irrespective
of
the
utterer
demanded
his
cordial
assent
are
very
right
sir
he
rejoined
with
spirit
indicate
the
generous
and
manly
course
to
have
your
approbation
returned
fledgeby
a
coincidence
mr
twemlow
here
he
descended
from
his
perch
and
sauntered
towards
him
the
friends
i
am
standing
by
are
the
friends
at
whose
house
i
met
you
the
lammles
she
a
very
taking
and
agreeable
woman
conscience
smote
the
gentle
twemlow
pale
he
said
is
when
she
appealed
to
me
this
morning
to
come
and
try
what
i
could
do
to
pacify
their
creditor
this
mr
riah
that
i
certainly
have
gained
some
little
influence
with
in
transacting
business
for
another
friend
but
nothing
like
so
much
as
she
supposes
and
when
a
woman
like
that
spoke
to
me
as
her
dearest
mr
fledgeby
and
shed
tears
why
what
could
i
do
you
know
twemlow
gasped
but
come
but
come
and
so
i
came
but
why
said
fledgeby
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
counterfeiting
deep
meditation
riah
should
have
started
up
when
i
told
him
that
the
lammles
entreated
him
to
hold
over
a
bill
of
sale
he
has
on
all
their
effects
and
why
he
should
have
cut
out
saying
he
would
be
back
directly
and
why
he
should
have
left
me
here
alone
so
long
i
can
not
understand
the
chivalrous
twemlow
knight
of
the
simple
heart
was
not
in
a
condition
to
offer
any
suggestion
he
was
too
penitent
too
remorseful
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
done
an
underhanded
action
and
he
had
done
wrong
he
had
secretly
interposed
against
this
confiding
young
man
for
no
better
real
reason
than
because
the
young
man
ways
were
not
his
ways
but
the
confiding
young
man
proceeded
to
heap
coals
of
fire
on
his
sensitive
head
beg
your
pardon
mr
twemlow
you
see
i
am
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
the
affairs
that
are
transacted
here
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
here
you
have
always
been
brought
up
as
a
gentleman
and
never
as
a
man
of
business
another
touch
of
possible
impertinence
in
this
place
perhaps
you
are
but
a
poor
man
of
business
what
else
is
to
be
expected
am
even
a
poorer
man
of
business
than
i
am
a
man
sir
returned
twemlow
i
could
hardly
express
my
deficiency
in
a
stronger
way
i
really
do
not
so
much
as
clearly
understand
my
position
in
the
matter
on
which
i
am
brought
here
but
there
are
reasons
which
make
me
very
delicate
of
accepting
your
assistance
i
am
greatly
greatly
disinclined
to
profit
by
it
i
do
deserve
it
good
childish
creature
condemned
to
a
passage
through
the
world
by
such
narrow
little
ways
and
picking
up
so
few
specks
or
spots
on
the
road
said
fledgeby
may
be
a
little
proud
of
entering
on
the
topic
having
been
brought
up
as
a
gentleman
not
that
sir
returned
twemlow
not
that
i
hope
i
distinguish
between
true
pride
and
false
pride
have
no
pride
at
all
myself
said
fledgeby
perhaps
i
cut
things
so
fine
as
to
know
one
from
but
i
know
this
is
a
place
where
even
a
man
of
business
needs
his
wits
about
him
and
if
mine
can
be
of
any
use
to
you
here
you
welcome
to
them
are
very
good
said
twemlow
faltering
i
am
most
unwilling
do
you
know
proceeded
fledgeby
with
an
glance
the
vanity
of
supposing
that
my
wits
could
be
of
any
use
to
you
in
society
but
they
might
be
here
you
cultivate
society
and
society
cultivates
you
but
mr
riah
not
society
in
society
mr
riah
is
kept
dark
eh
mr
twemlow
twemlow
much
disturbed
and
with
his
hand
fluttering
about
his
forehead
replied
true
the
confiding
young
man
besought
him
to
state
his
case
the
innocent
twemlow
expecting
fledgeby
to
be
astounded
by
what
he
should
unfold
and
not
for
an
instant
conceiving
the
possibility
of
its
happening
every
day
but
treating
of
it
as
a
terrible
phenomenon
occurring
in
the
course
of
ages
related
how
that
he
had
had
a
deceased
friend
a
married
civil
officer
with
a
family
who
had
wanted
money
for
change
of
place
on
change
of
post
and
how
he
twemlow
had
him
his
name
with
the
usual
but
in
the
eyes
of
twemlow
almost
incredible
result
that
he
had
been
left
to
repay
what
he
had
never
had
how
in
the
course
of
years
he
had
reduced
the
principal
by
trifling
sums
said
twemlow
to
observe
great
economy
being
in
the
enjoyment
of
a
fixed
income
limited
in
extent
and
that
depending
on
the
munificence
of
a
certain
nobleman
and
had
always
pinched
the
full
interest
out
of
himself
with
punctual
pinches
how
he
had
come
in
course
of
time
to
look
upon
this
one
only
debt
of
his
life
as
a
regular
quarterly
drawback
and
no
worse
when
name
had
some
way
fallen
into
the
possession
of
mr
riah
who
had
sent
him
notice
to
redeem
it
by
paying
up
in
full
in
one
plump
sum
or
take
tremendous
consequences
this
with
hazy
remembrances
of
how
he
had
been
carried
to
some
office
to
judgment
as
he
recollected
the
phrase
and
how
he
had
been
carried
to
another
office
where
his
life
was
assured
for
somebody
not
wholly
unconnected
with
the
sherry
trade
whom
he
remembered
by
the
remarkable
circumstance
that
he
had
a
straduarius
violin
to
dispose
of
and
also
a
madonna
formed
the
sum
and
substance
of
mr
twemlow
narrative
through
which
stalked
the
shadow
of
the
awful
snigsworth
eyed
afar
off
by
as
security
in
the
mist
and
menacing
twemlow
with
his
baronial
truncheon
to
all
mr
fledgeby
listened
with
the
modest
gravity
becoming
a
confiding
young
man
who
knew
it
all
beforehand
and
when
it
was
finished
seriously
shook
his
head
do
like
mr
twemlow
said
fledgeby
do
like
riah
calling
in
the
principal
if
determined
to
call
it
in
it
must
come
supposing
sir
said
twemlow
downcast
it
ca
come
retorted
fledgeby
must
go
you
know
asked
twemlow
faintly
prison
returned
fledgeby
whereat
mr
twemlow
leaned
his
innocent
head
upon
his
hand
and
moaned
a
little
moan
of
distress
and
disgrace
said
fledgeby
appearing
to
pluck
up
his
spirits
hope
it
not
so
bad
as
that
comes
to
if
you
allow
me
i
mention
to
mr
riah
when
he
comes
in
who
you
are
and
i
tell
him
you
my
friend
and
i
say
my
say
for
you
instead
of
your
saying
it
for
yourself
i
may
be
able
to
do
it
in
a
more
way
you
wo
consider
it
a
liberty
thank
you
again
and
again
sir
said
twemlow
am
strong
strongly
disinclined
to
avail
myself
of
your
generosity
though
my
helplessness
yields
for
i
can
not
but
feel
that
i
to
put
it
in
the
mildest
form
of
speech
that
i
have
done
nothing
to
deserve
it
can
he
be
muttered
fledgeby
referring
to
his
watch
again
can
he
have
gone
out
for
did
you
ever
see
him
mr
twemlow
is
a
thorough
jew
to
look
at
but
he
is
a
more
thorough
jew
to
deal
with
he
worst
when
he
quiet
if
he
quiet
i
shall
take
it
as
a
very
bad
sign
keep
your
eye
upon
him
when
he
comes
in
and
if
quiet
do
be
hopeful
here
he
is
he
looks
quiet
with
these
words
which
had
the
effect
of
causing
the
harmless
twemlow
painful
agitation
mr
fledgeby
withdrew
to
his
former
post
and
the
old
man
entered
the
mr
riah
said
fledgeby
thought
you
were
lost
the
old
man
glancing
at
the
stranger
stood
he
perceived
that
his
master
was
leading
up
to
the
orders
he
was
to
take
and
he
waited
to
understand
them
really
thought
repeated
fledgeby
slowly
you
were
lost
mr
riah
why
now
i
look
at
you
but
no
you
ca
have
done
it
no
you
ca
have
done
it
hat
in
hand
the
old
man
lifted
his
head
and
looked
distressfully
at
fledgeby
as
seeking
to
know
what
new
moral
burden
he
was
to
bear
ca
have
rushed
out
to
get
the
start
of
everybody
else
and
put
in
that
bill
of
sale
at
lammle
said
fledgeby
you
have
mr
riah
i
have
replied
the
old
man
in
a
low
voice
my
eye
cried
fledgeby
tut
tut
dear
dear
dear
well
i
knew
you
were
a
hard
customer
mr
riah
but
i
never
thought
you
were
as
hard
as
that
said
the
old
man
with
great
uneasiness
do
as
i
am
directed
i
am
not
the
principal
here
i
am
but
the
agent
of
a
superior
and
i
have
no
choice
no
power
say
so
retorted
fledgeby
secretly
exultant
as
the
old
man
stretched
out
his
hands
with
a
shrinking
action
of
defending
himself
against
the
sharp
construction
of
the
two
observers
play
the
tune
of
the
trade
mr
riah
you
a
right
to
get
in
your
debts
if
you
determined
to
do
it
but
do
pretend
what
every
one
in
your
line
regularly
pretends
at
least
do
do
it
to
me
why
should
you
mr
riah
you
know
i
know
all
about
you
the
old
man
clasped
the
skirt
of
his
long
coat
with
his
disengaged
hand
and
directed
a
wistful
look
at
fledgeby
do
said
fledgeby
i
entreat
you
as
a
favour
mr
riah
be
so
devilish
meek
for
i
know
what
follow
if
you
are
look
here
mr
riah
this
gentleman
is
mr
twemlow
the
jew
turned
to
him
and
bowed
that
poor
lamb
bowed
in
return
polite
and
terrified
have
made
such
a
failure
proceeded
fledgeby
trying
to
do
anything
with
you
for
my
friend
lammle
that
i
hardly
a
hope
of
doing
anything
with
you
for
my
friend
and
connexion
indeed
mr
twemlow
but
i
do
think
that
if
you
would
do
a
favour
for
anybody
you
would
for
me
and
i
wo
fail
for
want
of
trying
and
i
passed
my
promise
to
mr
twemlow
besides
now
mr
riah
here
is
mr
twemlow
always
good
for
his
interest
always
coming
up
to
time
always
paying
his
little
way
now
why
should
you
press
mr
twemlow
you
ca
have
any
spite
against
mr
twemlow
why
not
be
easy
with
mr
twemlow
the
old
man
looked
into
fledgeby
little
eyes
for
any
sign
of
leave
to
be
easy
with
mr
twemlow
but
there
was
no
sign
in
them
twemlow
is
no
connexion
of
yours
mr
riah
said
fledgeby
ca
want
to
be
even
with
him
for
having
through
life
gone
in
for
a
gentleman
and
hung
on
to
his
family
if
mr
twemlow
has
a
contempt
for
business
what
can
it
matter
to
you
pardon
me
interposed
the
gentle
victim
have
not
i
should
consider
it
presumption
mr
riah
said
fledgeby
that
handsomely
said
come
make
terms
with
me
for
mr
twemlow
the
old
man
looked
again
for
any
sign
of
permission
to
spare
the
poor
little
gentleman
no
mr
fledgeby
meant
him
to
be
racked
am
very
sorry
mr
twemlow
said
riah
have
my
instructions
i
am
invested
with
no
authority
for
diverging
from
them
the
money
must
be
paid
full
and
slap
down
do
you
mean
mr
riah
asked
fledgeby
to
make
things
quite
explicit
full
sir
and
at
once
was
riah
answer
mr
fledgeby
shook
his
head
deploringly
at
twemlow
and
mutely
expressed
in
reference
to
the
venerable
figure
standing
before
him
with
eyes
upon
the
ground
a
monster
of
an
israelite
this
is
riah
said
fledgeby
the
old
man
lifted
up
his
eyes
once
more
to
the
little
eyes
in
mr
fledgeby
head
with
some
reviving
hope
that
the
sign
might
be
coming
yet
riah
it
of
no
use
my
holding
back
the
fact
there
a
certain
great
party
in
the
background
in
mr
twemlow
case
and
you
know
it
know
it
the
old
man
admitted
i
put
it
as
a
plain
point
of
business
mr
riah
are
you
fully
determined
as
a
plain
point
of
business
either
to
have
that
said
great
party
security
or
that
said
great
party
money
determined
answered
riah
as
he
read
his
master
face
and
learnt
the
book
at
all
caring
for
and
indeed
as
it
seems
to
me
rather
enjoying
said
fledgeby
with
peculiar
unction
precious
and
row
that
will
come
off
between
mr
twemlow
and
the
said
great
party
this
required
no
answer
and
received
none
poor
mr
twemlow
who
had
betrayed
the
keenest
mental
terrors
since
his
noble
kinsman
loomed
in
the
perspective
rose
with
a
sigh
to
take
his
departure
thank
you
very
much
sir
he
said
offering
fledgeby
his
feverish
hand
have
done
me
an
unmerited
service
thank
you
thank
you
mention
it
answered
fledgeby
a
failure
so
far
but
stay
behind
and
take
another
touch
at
mr
riah
not
deceive
yourself
mr
twemlow
said
the
jew
then
addressing
him
directly
for
the
first
time
is
no
hope
for
you
you
must
expect
no
leniency
here
you
must
pay
in
full
and
you
can
not
pay
too
promptly
or
you
will
be
put
to
heavy
charges
trust
nothing
to
me
sir
money
money
money
when
he
had
said
these
words
in
an
emphatic
manner
he
acknowledged
mr
twemlow
still
polite
motion
of
his
head
and
that
amiable
little
worthy
took
his
departure
in
the
lowest
spirits
fascination
fledgeby
was
in
such
a
merry
vein
when
the
was
cleared
of
him
that
he
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
to
the
window
and
lean
his
arms
on
the
frame
of
the
blind
and
have
his
silent
laugh
out
with
his
back
to
his
subordinate
when
he
turned
round
again
with
a
composed
countenance
his
subordinate
still
stood
in
the
same
place
and
the
dolls
dressmaker
sat
behind
the
door
with
a
look
of
horror
cried
mr
fledgeby
forgetting
this
young
lady
mr
riah
and
she
has
been
waiting
long
enough
too
sell
her
her
waste
please
and
give
her
good
measure
if
you
can
make
up
your
mind
to
do
the
liberal
thing
for
once
he
looked
on
for
a
time
as
the
jew
filled
her
little
basket
with
such
scraps
as
she
was
used
to
buy
but
his
merry
vein
coming
on
again
he
was
obliged
to
turn
round
to
the
window
once
more
and
lean
his
arms
on
the
blind
my
cinderella
dear
said
the
old
man
in
a
whisper
and
with
a
look
basket
full
now
bless
you
and
get
you
gone
call
me
your
cinderella
dear
returned
miss
wren
you
cruel
godmother
she
shook
that
emphatic
little
forefinger
of
hers
in
his
face
at
parting
as
earnestly
and
reproachfully
as
she
had
ever
shaken
it
at
her
grim
old
child
at
home
are
not
the
godmother
at
all
said
she
are
the
wolf
in
the
forest
the
wicked
wolf
and
if
ever
my
dear
lizzie
is
sold
and
betrayed
i
shall
know
who
sold
and
betrayed
her
chapter
mr
wegg
prepares
a
grindstone
for
mr
boffin
nose
having
assisted
at
a
few
more
expositions
of
the
lives
of
misers
mr
venus
became
almost
indispensable
to
the
evenings
at
the
bower
the
circumstance
of
having
another
listener
to
the
wonders
unfolded
by
wegg
or
as
it
were
another
calculator
to
cast
up
the
guineas
found
in
teapots
chimneys
racks
and
mangers
and
other
such
banks
of
deposit
seemed
greatly
to
heighten
mr
boffin
enjoyment
while
silas
wegg
for
his
part
though
of
a
jealous
temperament
which
might
under
ordinary
circumstances
have
resented
the
anatomist
getting
into
favour
was
so
very
anxious
to
keep
his
eye
on
that
gentleman
lest
being
too
much
left
to
himself
he
should
be
tempted
to
play
any
tricks
with
the
precious
document
in
his
keeping
that
he
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
commending
him
to
mr
boffin
notice
as
a
third
party
whose
company
was
much
to
be
desired
another
friendly
demonstration
towards
him
mr
wegg
now
regularly
gratified
after
each
sitting
was
over
and
the
patron
had
departed
mr
wegg
invariably
saw
mr
venus
home
to
be
sure
he
as
invariably
requested
to
be
refreshed
with
a
sight
of
the
paper
in
which
he
was
a
joint
proprietor
but
he
never
failed
to
remark
that
it
was
the
great
pleasure
he
derived
from
mr
venus
improving
society
which
had
insensibly
lured
him
round
to
clerkenwell
again
and
that
finding
himself
once
more
attracted
to
the
spot
by
the
social
powers
of
mr
he
would
beg
leave
to
go
through
that
little
incidental
procedure
as
a
matter
of
form
well
i
know
sir
mr
wegg
would
add
a
man
of
your
delicate
mind
would
wish
to
be
checked
off
whenever
the
opportunity
arises
and
it
is
not
for
me
to
baulk
your
feelings
a
certain
rustiness
in
mr
venus
which
never
became
so
lubricated
by
the
oil
of
mr
wegg
but
that
he
turned
under
the
screw
in
a
creaking
and
stiff
manner
was
very
noticeable
at
about
this
period
while
assisting
at
the
literary
evenings
he
even
went
so
far
on
two
or
three
occasions
as
to
correct
mr
wegg
when
he
grossly
mispronounced
a
word
or
made
nonsense
of
a
passage
insomuch
that
mr
wegg
took
to
surveying
his
course
in
the
day
and
to
making
arrangements
for
getting
round
rocks
at
night
instead
of
running
straight
upon
them
of
the
slightest
anatomical
reference
he
became
particularly
shy
and
if
he
saw
a
bone
ahead
would
go
any
distance
out
of
his
way
rather
than
mention
it
by
name
the
adverse
destinies
ordained
that
one
evening
mr
wegg
labouring
bark
became
beset
by
polysyllables
and
embarrassed
among
a
perfect
archipelago
of
hard
words
it
being
necessary
to
take
soundings
every
minute
and
to
feel
the
way
with
the
greatest
caution
mr
attention
was
fully
employed
advantage
was
taken
of
this
dilemma
by
mr
venus
to
pass
a
scrap
of
paper
into
mr
boffin
hand
and
lay
his
finger
on
his
own
lip
when
mr
boffin
got
home
at
night
he
found
that
the
paper
contained
mr
venus
card
and
these
words
be
glad
to
be
honoured
with
a
call
respecting
business
of
your
own
about
dusk
on
an
early
evening
the
very
next
evening
saw
mr
boffin
peeping
in
at
the
preserved
frogs
in
mr
venus
and
saw
mr
venus
espying
mr
boffin
with
the
readiness
of
one
on
the
alert
and
beckoning
that
gentleman
into
his
interior
responding
mr
boffin
was
invited
to
seat
himself
on
the
box
of
human
miscellanies
before
the
fire
and
did
so
looking
round
the
place
with
admiring
eyes
the
fire
being
low
and
fitful
and
the
dusk
gloomy
the
whole
stock
seemed
to
be
winking
and
blinking
with
both
eyes
as
mr
venus
did
the
french
gentleman
though
he
had
no
eyes
was
not
at
all
but
appeared
as
the
flame
rose
and
fell
to
open
and
shut
his
no
eyes
with
the
regularity
of
the
dogs
and
ducks
and
birds
the
babies
were
equally
obliging
in
lending
their
grotesque
aid
to
the
general
effect
see
mr
venus
i
lost
no
time
said
mr
boffin
i
am
you
are
sir
assented
mr
venus
do
like
secrecy
pursued
mr
boffin
least
not
in
a
general
way
i
do
but
i
dare
say
you
show
me
good
reason
for
being
secret
so
far
think
i
shall
sir
returned
venus
said
mr
boffin
do
expect
wegg
i
take
it
for
granted
sir
i
expect
no
one
but
the
present
company
mr
boffin
glanced
about
him
as
accepting
under
that
inclusive
denomination
the
french
gentleman
and
the
circle
in
which
he
move
and
repeated
present
company
said
mr
venus
entering
upon
business
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
for
your
word
and
honour
that
we
are
in
confidence
wait
a
bit
and
understand
what
the
expression
means
answered
mr
boffin
confidence
for
how
long
in
confidence
for
ever
and
a
day
take
your
hint
sir
said
venus
think
you
might
consider
the
business
when
you
came
to
know
it
to
be
of
a
nature
incompatible
with
confidence
on
your
part
might
said
mr
boffin
with
a
cautious
look
sir
well
sir
observed
venus
after
clutching
at
his
dusty
hair
to
brighten
his
ideas
us
put
it
another
way
i
open
the
business
with
you
relying
upon
your
honour
not
to
do
anything
in
it
and
not
to
mention
me
in
it
without
my
knowledge
sounds
fair
said
mr
boffin
agree
to
that
have
your
word
and
honour
sir
good
fellow
retorted
mr
boffin
have
my
word
and
how
you
can
have
that
without
my
honour
too
i
do
know
i
sorted
a
lot
of
dust
in
my
time
but
i
never
knew
the
two
things
go
into
separate
heaps
this
remark
seemed
rather
to
abash
mr
venus
he
hesitated
and
said
true
sir
and
again
true
sir
before
resuming
the
thread
of
his
discourse
boffin
if
i
confess
to
you
that
i
fell
into
a
proposal
of
which
you
were
the
subject
and
of
which
you
ought
to
have
been
the
subject
you
will
allow
me
to
mention
and
will
please
take
into
favourable
consideration
that
i
was
in
a
crushed
state
of
mind
at
the
time
the
golden
dustman
with
his
hands
folded
on
the
top
of
his
stout
stick
with
his
chin
resting
upon
them
and
with
something
leering
and
whimsical
in
his
eyes
gave
a
nod
and
said
so
venus
proposal
sir
was
a
conspiring
breach
of
your
confidence
to
such
an
extent
that
i
ought
at
once
to
have
made
it
known
to
you
but
i
did
mr
boffin
and
i
fell
into
it
without
moving
eye
or
finger
mr
boffin
gave
another
nod
and
placidly
repeated
so
venus
that
i
was
ever
hearty
in
it
sir
the
penitent
anatomist
went
on
that
i
ever
viewed
myself
with
anything
but
reproach
for
having
turned
out
of
the
paths
of
science
into
the
paths
of
he
was
going
to
say
but
unwilling
to
press
too
hard
upon
himself
substituted
with
great
emphasis
placid
and
whimsical
of
look
as
ever
mr
boffin
answered
so
venus
now
sir
said
venus
prepared
your
mind
in
the
rough
i
will
articulate
the
details
with
which
brief
professional
exordium
he
entered
on
the
history
of
the
friendly
move
and
truly
recounted
it
one
might
have
thought
that
it
would
have
extracted
some
show
of
surprise
or
anger
or
other
emotion
from
mr
boffin
but
it
extracted
nothing
beyond
his
former
comment
so
venus
have
astonished
you
sir
i
believe
said
mr
venus
pausing
dubiously
mr
boffin
simply
answered
as
aforesaid
so
venus
by
this
time
the
astonishment
was
all
on
the
other
side
it
did
not
however
so
continue
for
when
venus
passed
to
wegg
discovery
and
from
that
to
their
having
both
seen
mr
boffin
dig
up
the
dutch
bottle
that
gentleman
changed
colour
changed
his
attitude
became
extremely
restless
and
ended
when
venus
ended
by
being
in
a
state
of
manifest
anxiety
trepidation
and
confusion
sir
said
venus
finishing
off
best
know
what
was
in
that
dutch
bottle
and
why
you
dug
it
up
and
took
it
away
i
do
pretend
to
know
anything
more
about
it
than
i
saw
all
i
know
is
this
i
am
proud
of
my
calling
after
all
though
it
has
been
attended
by
one
dreadful
drawback
which
has
told
upon
my
heart
and
almost
equally
upon
my
skeleton
and
i
mean
to
live
by
my
calling
putting
the
same
meaning
into
other
words
i
do
not
mean
to
turn
a
single
dishonest
penny
by
this
affair
as
the
best
amends
i
can
make
you
for
having
ever
gone
into
it
i
make
known
to
you
as
a
warning
what
wegg
has
found
out
my
opinion
is
that
wegg
is
not
to
be
silenced
at
a
modest
price
and
i
build
that
opinion
on
his
beginning
to
dispose
of
your
property
the
moment
he
knew
his
power
whether
it
worth
your
while
to
silence
him
at
any
price
you
will
decide
for
yourself
and
take
your
measures
accordingly
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
have
no
price
if
i
am
ever
called
upon
for
the
truth
i
tell
it
but
i
want
to
do
no
more
than
i
have
now
done
and
ended
venus
said
mr
boffin
with
a
hearty
grip
of
his
hand
venus
venus
and
then
walked
up
and
down
the
little
shop
in
great
agitation
look
here
venus
he
resumed
nervously
sitting
down
again
i
have
to
buy
wegg
up
i
sha
buy
him
any
cheaper
for
your
being
out
of
it
instead
of
his
having
half
the
money
it
was
to
have
been
half
i
suppose
share
and
share
alike
was
to
have
been
half
sir
answered
venus
of
that
he
now
have
all
i
shall
pay
the
same
if
not
more
for
you
tell
me
he
an
unconscionable
dog
a
ravenous
rascal
is
said
venus
you
think
venus
insinuated
mr
boffin
after
looking
at
the
fire
for
a
while
you
feel
as
if
you
might
like
to
pretend
to
be
in
it
till
wegg
was
bought
up
and
then
ease
your
mind
by
handing
over
to
me
what
you
had
made
believe
to
pocket
i
do
sir
returned
venus
very
positively
to
make
amends
insinuated
mr
boffin
sir
it
seems
to
me
after
maturely
thinking
it
over
that
the
best
amends
for
having
got
out
of
the
square
is
to
get
back
into
the
square
mused
mr
boffin
you
say
the
square
you
mean
mean
said
venus
stoutly
and
shortly
right
appears
to
me
said
mr
boffin
grumbling
over
the
fire
in
an
injured
manner
the
right
is
with
me
if
it
anywhere
i
have
much
more
right
to
the
old
man
money
than
the
crown
can
ever
have
what
was
the
crown
to
him
except
the
king
taxes
whereas
me
and
my
wife
we
was
all
in
all
to
him
mr
venus
with
his
head
upon
his
hands
rendered
melancholy
by
the
contemplation
of
mr
boffin
avarice
only
murmured
to
steep
himself
in
the
luxury
of
that
frame
of
mind
did
not
wish
so
to
regard
herself
nor
yet
to
be
so
regarded
how
am
i
to
live
asked
mr
boffin
piteously
i
to
be
going
buying
fellows
up
out
of
the
little
that
i
got
and
how
am
i
to
set
about
it
when
am
i
to
get
my
money
ready
when
am
i
to
make
a
bid
you
have
told
me
when
he
threatens
to
drop
down
upon
me
venus
explained
under
what
conditions
and
with
what
views
the
dropping
down
upon
mr
boffin
was
held
over
until
the
mounds
should
be
cleared
away
mr
boffin
listened
attentively
suppose
said
he
with
a
gleam
of
hope
no
doubt
about
the
genuineness
and
date
of
this
confounded
will
whatever
said
mr
venus
might
it
be
deposited
at
present
asked
mr
boffin
in
a
wheedling
tone
in
my
possession
sir
it
he
cried
with
great
eagerness
for
any
liberal
sum
of
money
that
could
be
agreed
upon
venus
would
you
put
it
in
the
fire
sir
i
would
interrupted
mr
venus
pass
it
over
to
me
would
be
the
same
thing
no
sir
said
mr
venus
the
golden
dustman
seemed
about
to
pursue
these
questions
when
a
stumping
noise
was
heard
outside
coming
towards
the
door
wegg
said
venus
behind
the
young
alligator
in
the
corner
mr
boffin
and
judge
him
for
yourself
i
wo
light
a
candle
till
gone
there
only
be
the
glow
of
the
fire
wegg
well
acquainted
with
the
alligator
and
he
wo
take
particular
notice
of
him
draw
your
legs
in
mr
boffin
at
present
i
see
a
pair
of
shoes
at
the
end
of
his
tail
get
your
head
well
behind
his
smile
mr
boffin
and
you
lie
comfortable
there
you
find
plenty
of
room
behind
his
smile
he
a
little
dusty
but
he
very
like
you
in
tone
are
you
right
sir
mr
boffin
had
but
whispered
an
affirmative
response
when
wegg
came
stumping
in
said
that
gentleman
in
a
sprightly
manner
yourself
returned
mr
venus
much
to
boast
of
said
wegg
partner
that
you
not
picking
up
faster
but
your
soul
too
large
for
your
body
sir
that
where
it
is
and
how
our
stock
in
trade
partner
safe
bind
safe
find
partner
is
that
about
it
you
wish
to
see
it
asked
venus
you
please
partner
said
wegg
rubbing
his
hands
wish
to
see
it
jintly
with
yourself
or
in
similar
words
to
some
that
was
set
to
music
some
time
back
i
wish
you
to
see
it
with
your
eyes
and
i
will
pledge
with
turning
his
back
and
turning
a
key
mr
venus
produced
the
document
holding
on
by
his
usual
corner
mr
wegg
holding
on
by
the
opposite
corner
sat
down
on
the
seat
so
lately
vacated
by
mr
boffin
and
looked
it
over
right
sir
he
slowly
and
unwillingly
admitted
in
his
reluctance
to
loose
his
hold
right
and
greedily
watched
his
partner
as
he
turned
his
back
again
and
turned
his
key
again
nothing
new
i
suppose
said
venus
resuming
his
low
chair
behind
the
counter
there
is
sir
replied
wegg
was
something
new
this
morning
that
foxey
old
grasper
and
griper
boffin
inquired
venus
with
a
glance
towards
the
alligator
yard
or
two
of
smile
be
blowed
cried
wegg
yielding
to
his
honest
indignation
dusty
boffin
that
foxey
old
grunter
and
grinder
sir
turns
into
the
yard
this
morning
to
meddle
with
our
property
a
menial
tool
of
his
own
a
young
man
by
the
name
of
sloppy
ecod
when
i
say
to
him
what
do
you
want
here
young
man
this
is
a
private
yard
he
pulls
out
a
paper
from
boffin
other
blackguard
the
one
i
was
passed
over
for
this
is
to
authorize
sloppy
to
overlook
the
carting
and
to
watch
the
that
pretty
strong
i
think
mr
venus
he
does
know
yet
of
our
claim
on
the
property
suggested
venus
he
must
have
a
hint
of
it
said
wegg
a
strong
one
jog
his
terrors
a
bit
give
him
an
inch
and
he
take
an
ell
let
him
alone
this
time
and
what
he
do
with
our
property
next
i
tell
you
what
mr
venus
it
comes
to
this
i
must
be
overbearing
with
boffin
or
i
shall
fly
into
several
pieces
i
ca
contain
myself
when
i
look
at
him
every
time
i
see
him
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
i
see
him
putting
it
into
my
pocket
every
time
i
hear
him
jingling
his
money
i
hear
him
taking
liberties
with
my
money
flesh
and
blood
ca
bear
it
no
said
mr
wegg
greatly
exasperated
i
go
further
a
wooden
leg
ca
bear
it
mr
wegg
urged
venus
was
your
own
idea
that
he
should
not
be
exploded
upon
till
the
mounds
were
carted
away
it
was
likewise
my
idea
mr
venus
retorted
wegg
if
he
came
sneaking
and
sniffing
about
the
property
he
should
be
threatened
given
to
understand
that
he
has
no
right
to
it
and
be
made
our
slave
that
my
idea
mr
venus
certainly
was
mr
wegg
certainly
was
as
you
say
partner
assented
wegg
put
into
a
better
humour
by
the
ready
admission
well
i
consider
his
planting
one
of
his
menial
tools
in
the
yard
an
act
of
sneaking
and
sniffing
and
his
nose
shall
be
put
to
the
grindstone
for
it
was
not
your
fault
mr
wegg
i
must
admit
said
venus
he
got
off
with
the
dutch
bottle
that
night
you
handsomely
say
again
partner
no
it
was
not
my
fault
i
have
had
that
bottle
out
of
him
was
it
to
be
borne
that
he
should
come
like
a
thief
in
the
dark
digging
among
stuff
that
was
far
more
ours
than
his
seeing
that
we
could
deprive
him
of
every
grain
of
it
if
he
did
buy
us
at
our
own
figure
and
carrying
off
treasure
from
its
bowels
no
it
was
not
to
be
borne
and
for
that
too
his
nose
shall
be
put
to
the
grindstone
do
you
propose
to
do
it
mr
wegg
put
his
nose
to
the
grindstone
i
propose
returned
that
estimable
man
insult
him
openly
and
if
looking
into
this
eye
of
mine
he
dares
to
offer
a
word
in
answer
to
retort
upon
him
before
he
can
take
his
breath
add
another
word
to
that
you
dusty
old
dog
and
you
a
he
says
nothing
mr
wegg
replied
wegg
shall
have
come
to
an
understanding
with
very
little
trouble
and
i
break
him
and
drive
him
mr
venus
i
put
him
in
harness
and
i
bear
him
up
tight
and
i
break
him
and
drive
him
the
harder
the
old
dust
is
driven
sir
the
higher
he
pay
and
i
mean
to
be
paid
high
mr
venus
i
promise
you
speak
quite
revengefully
mr
wegg
sir
is
it
for
him
that
i
have
declined
and
falled
night
after
night
is
it
for
his
pleasure
that
i
waited
at
home
of
an
evening
like
a
set
of
skittles
to
be
set
up
and
knocked
over
set
up
and
knocked
over
by
whatever
balls
or
books
he
chose
to
bring
against
me
why
i
a
hundred
times
the
man
he
is
sir
five
hundred
times
perhaps
it
was
with
the
malicious
intent
of
urging
him
on
to
his
worst
that
mr
venus
looked
as
if
he
doubted
that
was
it
outside
the
house
at
present
ockypied
to
its
disgrace
by
that
minion
of
fortune
and
worm
of
the
hour
said
wegg
falling
back
upon
his
strongest
terms
of
reprobation
and
slapping
the
counter
i
silas
wegg
five
hundred
times
the
man
he
ever
was
sat
in
all
weathers
waiting
for
a
errand
or
a
customer
was
it
outside
that
very
house
as
i
first
set
eyes
upon
him
rolling
in
the
lap
of
luxury
when
i
was
selling
halfpenny
ballads
there
for
a
living
and
am
i
to
grovel
in
the
dust
for
him
to
walk
over
no
there
was
a
grin
upon
the
ghastly
countenance
of
the
french
gentleman
under
the
influence
of
the
firelight
as
if
he
were
computing
how
many
thousand
slanderers
and
traitors
array
themselves
against
the
fortunate
on
premises
exactly
answering
to
those
of
mr
wegg
one
might
have
fancied
that
the
babies
were
toppling
over
with
their
hydrocephalic
attempts
to
reckon
up
the
children
of
men
who
transform
their
benefactors
into
their
injurers
by
the
same
process
the
yard
or
two
of
smile
on
the
part
of
the
alligator
might
have
been
invested
with
the
meaning
about
this
was
quite
familiar
knowledge
down
in
the
depths
of
the
slime
ages
ago
said
wegg
possibly
with
some
slight
perception
to
the
foregoing
effect
speaking
countenance
remarks
mr
venus
that
i
duller
and
savager
than
usual
perhaps
i
have
allowed
myself
to
brood
too
much
begone
dull
care
is
gone
sir
i
looked
in
upon
you
and
empire
resumes
her
sway
for
as
the
song
says
subject
to
your
correction
sir
when
the
heart
of
a
man
is
depressed
with
cares
the
mist
is
dispelled
if
venus
appears
like
the
notes
of
a
fiddle
you
sweetly
sir
sweetly
raises
our
spirits
and
charms
our
sir
shall
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
to
you
mr
wegg
before
long
remarked
venus
my
share
in
the
project
we
been
speaking
of
time
sir
returned
wegg
yours
in
the
meanwhile
let
it
be
fully
understood
that
i
shall
not
neglect
bringing
the
grindstone
to
bear
nor
yet
bringing
dusty
boffin
nose
to
it
his
nose
once
brought
to
it
shall
be
held
to
it
by
these
hands
mr
venus
till
the
sparks
flies
out
in
showers
with
this
agreeable
promise
wegg
stumped
out
and
shut
the
after
him
till
i
light
a
candle
mr
boffin
said
venus
you
come
out
more
comfortable
so
he
lighting
a
candle
and
holding
it
up
at
arm
length
mr
boffin
disengaged
himself
from
behind
the
alligator
smile
with
an
expression
of
countenance
so
very
downcast
that
it
not
only
appeared
as
if
the
alligator
had
the
whole
of
the
joke
to
himself
but
further
as
if
it
had
been
conceived
and
executed
at
mr
boffin
expense
a
treacherous
fellow
said
mr
boffin
dusting
his
arms
and
legs
as
he
came
forth
the
alligator
having
been
but
musty
company
a
dreadful
fellow
alligator
sir
said
venus
venus
no
the
serpent
have
the
goodness
to
notice
mr
boffin
remarked
venus
i
said
nothing
to
him
about
my
going
out
of
the
affair
altogether
because
i
did
wish
to
take
you
anyways
by
surprise
but
i
ca
be
too
soon
out
of
it
for
my
satisfaction
mr
boffin
and
i
now
put
it
to
you
when
it
will
suit
your
views
for
me
to
retire
venus
venus
but
i
do
know
what
to
say
returned
mr
boffin
do
know
what
to
do
he
drop
down
on
me
any
way
he
seems
fully
determined
to
drop
down
do
he
mr
venus
opined
that
such
was
clearly
his
intention
might
be
a
sort
of
protection
for
me
if
you
remained
in
it
said
mr
boffin
might
stand
betwixt
him
and
me
and
take
the
edge
off
him
do
you
feel
as
if
you
could
make
a
show
of
remaining
in
it
venus
till
i
had
time
to
turn
myself
round
venus
naturally
inquired
how
long
mr
boffin
thought
it
might
take
him
to
turn
himself
round
am
sure
i
do
know
was
the
answer
given
quite
at
a
loss
is
so
at
sixes
and
sevens
if
i
had
never
come
into
the
property
i
should
have
minded
but
being
in
it
it
would
be
very
trying
to
be
turned
out
now
do
you
acknowledge
that
it
would
venus
mr
venus
preferred
he
said
to
leave
mr
boffin
to
arrive
at
his
own
conclusions
on
that
delicate
question
am
sure
i
do
know
what
to
do
said
mr
boffin
i
ask
advice
of
any
one
else
it
only
letting
in
another
person
to
be
bought
out
and
then
i
shall
be
ruined
that
way
and
might
as
well
have
given
up
the
property
and
gone
slap
to
the
workhouse
if
i
was
to
take
advice
of
my
young
man
rokesmith
i
should
have
to
buy
him
out
sooner
or
later
of
course
he
drop
down
upon
me
like
wegg
i
was
brought
into
the
world
to
be
dropped
down
upon
it
appears
to
me
mr
venus
listened
to
these
lamentations
in
silence
while
mr
boffin
jogged
to
and
fro
holding
his
pockets
as
if
he
had
a
pain
in
them
all
you
have
said
what
you
mean
to
do
yourself
venus
when
you
do
go
out
of
it
how
do
you
mean
to
go
venus
replied
that
as
wegg
had
found
the
document
and
handed
it
to
him
it
was
his
intention
to
hand
it
back
to
wegg
with
the
declaration
that
he
himself
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
it
or
do
with
it
and
that
wegg
must
act
as
he
chose
and
take
the
consequences
then
he
drops
down
with
his
whole
weight
upon
me
cried
mr
boffin
ruefully
sooner
be
dropped
upon
by
you
than
by
him
or
even
by
you
jintly
than
by
him
alone
mr
venus
could
only
repeat
that
it
was
his
fixed
intention
to
betake
himself
to
the
paths
of
science
and
to
walk
in
the
same
all
the
days
of
his
life
not
dropping
down
upon
his
until
they
were
deceased
and
then
only
to
articulate
them
to
the
best
of
his
humble
ability
long
could
you
be
persuaded
to
keep
up
the
appearance
of
remaining
in
it
asked
mr
boffin
retiring
on
his
other
idea
you
be
got
to
do
so
till
the
mounds
are
gone
no
that
would
protract
the
mental
uneasiness
of
mr
venus
too
long
he
said
if
i
was
to
show
you
reason
now
demanded
mr
boffin
if
i
was
to
show
you
good
and
sufficient
reason
if
by
good
and
sufficient
reason
mr
boffin
meant
honest
and
unimpeachable
reason
that
might
weigh
with
mr
venus
against
his
personal
wishes
and
convenience
but
he
must
add
that
he
saw
no
opening
to
the
possibility
of
such
reason
being
shown
him
and
see
me
venus
said
mr
boffin
my
house
the
reason
there
sir
asked
mr
venus
with
an
incredulous
smile
and
blink
may
be
or
may
not
be
said
mr
boffin
as
you
view
it
but
in
the
meantime
do
go
out
of
the
matter
look
here
do
this
give
me
your
word
that
you
wo
take
any
steps
with
wegg
without
my
knowledge
just
as
i
have
given
you
my
word
that
i
wo
without
yours
mr
boffin
said
venus
after
brief
consideration
venus
venus
done
shall
i
come
to
see
you
mr
boffin
you
like
the
sooner
the
better
i
must
be
going
now
venus
sir
to
the
rest
of
the
present
company
said
mr
boffin
glancing
round
the
shop
make
a
queer
show
venus
and
i
should
like
to
be
better
acquainted
with
them
some
day
venus
thankee
venus
thankee
venus
with
that
he
jogged
out
into
the
street
and
jogged
upon
his
homeward
way
i
wonder
he
meditated
as
he
went
along
nursing
his
stick
it
can
be
that
venus
is
setting
himself
to
get
the
better
of
wegg
whether
it
can
be
that
he
means
when
i
have
bought
wegg
out
to
have
me
all
to
himself
and
to
pick
me
clean
to
the
bones
it
was
a
cunning
and
suspicious
idea
quite
in
the
way
of
his
school
of
misers
and
he
looked
very
cunning
and
suspicious
as
he
went
jogging
through
the
streets
more
than
once
or
twice
more
than
twice
or
thrice
say
half
a
dozen
times
he
took
his
stick
from
the
arm
on
which
he
nursed
it
and
hit
a
straight
sharp
rap
at
the
air
with
its
head
possibly
the
wooden
countenance
of
mr
silas
wegg
was
incorporeally
before
him
at
those
moments
for
he
hit
with
intense
satisfaction
he
was
within
a
few
streets
of
his
own
house
when
a
little
private
carriage
coming
in
the
contrary
direction
passed
him
turned
round
and
passed
him
again
it
was
a
little
carriage
of
eccentric
movement
for
again
he
heard
it
stop
behind
him
and
turn
round
and
again
he
saw
it
pass
him
then
it
stopped
and
then
went
on
out
of
sight
but
not
far
out
of
sight
for
when
he
came
to
the
corner
of
his
own
street
there
it
stood
again
there
was
a
lady
face
at
the
window
as
he
came
up
with
this
carriage
and
he
was
passing
it
when
the
lady
softly
called
to
him
by
his
name
beg
your
pardon
said
mr
boffin
coming
to
a
stop
is
mrs
lammle
said
the
lady
mr
boffin
went
up
to
the
window
and
hoped
mrs
lammle
was
well
very
well
dear
mr
boffin
i
have
fluttered
myself
by
being
perhaps
foolishly
uneasy
and
anxious
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
some
time
can
i
speak
to
you
mr
boffin
proposed
that
mrs
lammle
should
drive
on
to
his
house
a
few
hundred
yards
further
would
rather
not
mr
boffin
unless
you
particularly
wish
it
i
feel
the
difficulty
and
delicacy
of
the
matter
so
much
that
i
would
rather
avoid
speaking
to
you
at
your
own
home
you
must
think
this
very
strange
mr
boffin
said
no
but
meant
yes
is
because
i
am
so
grateful
for
the
good
opinion
of
all
my
friends
and
am
so
touched
by
it
that
i
can
not
bear
to
run
the
risk
of
forfeiting
it
in
any
case
even
in
the
cause
of
duty
i
have
asked
my
husband
my
dear
alfred
mr
boffin
whether
it
is
the
cause
of
duty
and
he
has
most
emphatically
said
yes
i
wish
i
had
asked
him
sooner
it
would
have
spared
me
much
distress
this
be
more
dropping
down
upon
me
thought
mr
boffin
quite
bewildered
was
alfred
who
sent
me
to
you
mr
boffin
alfred
said
come
back
sophronia
until
you
have
seen
mr
boffin
and
told
him
all
whatever
he
may
think
of
it
he
ought
certainly
to
know
would
you
mind
coming
into
the
carriage
mr
boffin
answered
at
all
and
took
his
seat
at
mrs
side
slowly
anywhere
mrs
lammle
called
to
her
coachman
let
the
carriage
rattle
must
be
more
dropping
down
i
think
said
mr
boffin
to
himself
next
chapter
the
golden
dustman
at
his
worst
the
breakfast
table
at
mr
boffin
was
usually
a
very
pleasant
one
and
was
always
presided
over
by
bella
as
though
he
began
each
new
day
in
his
healthy
natural
character
and
some
waking
hours
were
necessary
to
his
relapse
into
the
corrupting
influences
of
his
wealth
the
face
and
the
demeanour
of
the
golden
dustman
were
generally
unclouded
at
that
meal
it
would
have
been
easy
to
believe
then
that
there
was
no
change
in
him
it
was
as
the
day
went
on
that
the
clouds
gathered
and
the
brightness
of
the
morning
became
obscured
one
might
have
said
that
the
shadows
of
avarice
and
distrust
lengthened
as
his
own
shadow
lengthened
and
that
the
night
closed
around
him
gradually
but
one
morning
long
afterwards
to
be
remembered
it
was
black
midnight
with
the
golden
dustman
when
he
first
appeared
his
altered
character
had
never
been
so
grossly
marked
his
bearing
towards
his
secretary
was
so
charged
with
insolent
distrust
and
arrogance
that
the
latter
rose
and
left
the
table
before
breakfast
was
half
done
the
look
he
directed
at
the
secretary
retiring
figure
was
so
cunningly
malignant
that
bella
would
have
sat
astounded
and
indignant
even
though
he
had
not
gone
the
length
of
secretly
threatening
rokesmith
with
his
clenched
fist
as
he
closed
the
door
this
unlucky
morning
of
all
mornings
in
the
year
was
the
morning
next
after
mr
boffin
interview
with
mrs
lammle
in
her
little
carriage
bella
looked
to
mrs
boffin
face
for
comment
on
or
explanation
of
this
stormy
humour
in
her
husband
but
none
was
there
an
anxious
and
a
distressed
observation
of
her
own
face
was
all
she
could
read
in
it
when
they
were
left
alone
together
which
was
not
until
noon
for
mr
boffin
sat
long
in
his
by
turns
jogging
up
and
down
the
clenching
his
fist
and
muttering
bella
in
consternation
asked
her
what
had
happened
what
was
wrong
am
forbidden
to
speak
to
you
about
it
bella
dear
i
must
tell
you
was
all
the
answer
she
could
get
and
still
whenever
in
her
wonder
and
dismay
she
raised
her
eyes
to
mrs
boffin
face
she
saw
in
it
the
same
anxious
and
distressed
observation
of
her
own
oppressed
by
her
sense
that
trouble
was
impending
and
lost
in
speculations
why
mrs
boffin
should
look
at
her
as
if
she
had
any
part
in
it
bella
found
the
day
long
and
dreary
it
was
far
on
in
the
afternoon
when
she
being
in
her
own
room
a
servant
brought
her
a
message
from
mr
boffin
begging
her
to
come
to
his
mrs
boffin
was
there
seated
on
a
sofa
and
mr
boffin
was
jogging
up
and
down
on
seeing
bella
he
stopped
beckoned
her
to
him
and
drew
her
arm
through
his
be
alarmed
my
dear
he
said
gently
am
not
angry
with
you
why
you
actually
tremble
do
be
alarmed
bella
my
dear
i
see
you
righted
me
righted
thought
bella
and
then
repeated
aloud
in
a
tone
of
astonishment
me
righted
sir
ay
said
mr
boffin
you
righted
send
mr
rokesmith
here
you
sir
bella
would
have
been
lost
in
perplexity
if
there
had
been
pause
enough
but
the
servant
found
mr
rokesmith
near
at
hand
and
he
almost
immediately
presented
himself
the
door
sir
said
mr
boffin
have
got
something
to
say
to
you
which
i
fancy
you
not
be
pleased
to
hear
am
sorry
to
reply
mr
boffin
returned
the
secretary
as
having
closed
the
door
he
turned
and
faced
him
i
think
that
very
likely
do
you
mean
blustered
mr
boffin
mean
that
it
has
become
no
novelty
to
me
to
hear
from
your
lips
what
i
would
rather
not
hear
perhaps
we
shall
change
that
said
mr
boffin
with
a
threatening
roll
of
his
head
hope
so
returned
the
secretary
he
was
quiet
and
respectful
but
stood
as
bella
thought
and
was
glad
to
think
on
his
manhood
too
sir
said
mr
boffin
at
this
young
lady
on
my
arm
bella
involuntarily
raising
her
eyes
when
this
sudden
reference
was
made
to
herself
met
those
of
mr
rokesmith
he
was
pale
and
seemed
agitated
then
her
eyes
passed
on
to
mrs
boffin
and
she
met
the
look
again
in
a
flash
it
enlightened
her
and
she
began
to
understand
what
she
had
done
say
to
you
sir
mr
boffin
repeated
at
this
young
lady
on
my
arm
do
so
returned
the
secretary
as
his
glance
rested
again
on
bella
for
a
moment
she
thought
there
was
reproach
in
it
but
it
is
possible
that
the
reproach
was
within
herself
dare
you
sir
said
mr
boffin
unknown
to
me
with
this
young
lady
how
dare
you
come
out
of
your
station
and
your
place
in
my
house
to
pester
this
young
lady
with
your
impudent
addresses
must
decline
to
answer
questions
said
the
secretary
are
so
offensively
asked
decline
to
answer
retorted
mr
boffin
decline
to
answer
do
you
then
i
tell
you
what
it
is
rokesmith
i
answer
for
you
there
are
two
sides
to
this
matter
and
i
take
separately
the
first
side
is
sheer
insolence
that
the
first
side
the
secretary
smiled
with
some
bitterness
as
though
he
would
have
said
i
see
and
hear
was
sheer
insolence
in
you
i
tell
you
said
mr
boffin
to
think
of
this
young
lady
this
young
lady
was
far
above
you
this
young
lady
was
no
match
for
you
this
young
lady
was
lying
in
wait
as
she
was
qualified
to
do
for
money
and
you
had
no
money
bella
hung
her
head
and
seemed
to
shrink
a
little
from
mr
protecting
arm
are
you
i
should
like
to
know
pursued
mr
boffin
you
were
to
have
the
audacity
to
follow
up
this
young
lady
this
young
lady
was
looking
about
the
market
for
a
good
bid
she
was
in
it
to
be
snapped
up
by
fellows
that
had
no
money
to
lay
out
nothing
to
buy
with
mr
boffin
mrs
boffin
pray
say
something
for
me
murmured
bella
disengaging
her
arm
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
lady
said
mr
boffin
anticipating
his
wife
hold
your
tongue
bella
my
dear
do
you
let
yourself
be
put
out
i
right
you
you
do
you
do
right
me
exclaimed
bella
with
great
emphasis
wrong
me
wrong
me
you
be
put
out
my
dear
complacently
retorted
mr
boffin
bring
this
young
man
to
book
now
you
rokesmith
you
ca
decline
to
hear
you
know
as
well
as
to
answer
you
hear
me
tell
you
that
the
first
side
of
your
conduct
was
insolence
insolence
and
presumption
answer
me
one
thing
if
you
can
did
this
young
lady
tell
you
so
herself
i
mr
rokesmith
asked
bella
with
her
face
still
covered
say
mr
rokesmith
did
i
be
distressed
miss
wilfer
it
matters
very
little
now
you
ca
deny
it
though
said
mr
boffin
with
a
knowing
shake
of
his
head
i
have
asked
him
to
forgive
me
since
cried
bella
i
would
ask
him
to
forgive
me
now
again
upon
my
knees
if
it
would
spare
him
here
mrs
boffin
broke
out
lady
said
mr
boffin
that
noise
in
you
miss
bella
but
i
mean
to
have
it
out
right
through
with
this
young
man
having
got
him
into
a
corner
now
you
rokesmith
i
tell
you
that
one
side
of
your
conduct
insolence
and
presumption
now
i
to
the
other
which
is
much
worse
this
was
a
speculation
of
yours
indignantly
deny
it
of
no
use
your
denying
it
it
does
signify
a
bit
whether
you
deny
it
or
not
i
got
a
head
upon
my
shoulders
and
it
ai
a
baby
what
said
mr
boffin
gathering
himself
together
in
his
most
suspicious
attitude
and
wrinkling
his
face
into
a
very
map
of
curves
and
corners
i
know
what
grabs
are
made
at
a
man
with
money
if
i
did
keep
my
eyes
open
and
my
pockets
buttoned
should
i
be
brought
to
the
workhouse
before
i
knew
where
i
was
was
the
experience
of
dancer
and
elwes
and
hopkins
and
blewbury
jones
and
ever
so
many
more
of
similar
to
mine
did
everybody
want
to
make
grabs
at
what
they
got
and
bring
to
poverty
and
ruin
they
forced
to
hide
everything
belonging
to
for
fear
it
should
be
snatched
from
of
course
they
was
i
shall
be
told
next
that
they
did
know
human
natur
poor
creatures
murmured
the
secretary
do
you
say
asked
mr
boffin
snapping
at
him
you
need
be
at
the
trouble
of
repeating
it
for
it
ai
worth
hearing
and
wo
go
down
with
me
i
to
unfold
your
plan
before
this
young
lady
i
to
show
this
young
lady
the
second
view
of
you
and
nothing
you
can
say
will
stave
it
off
now
attend
here
bella
my
dear
rokesmith
you
a
needy
chap
you
a
chap
that
i
pick
up
in
the
street
are
you
or
ai
you
on
mr
boffin
do
appeal
to
me
appeal
to
you
retorted
mr
boffin
as
if
he
had
done
so
i
should
hope
not
appealing
to
you
would
be
rather
a
rum
course
as
i
was
saying
you
a
needy
chap
that
i
pick
up
in
the
street
you
come
and
ask
me
in
the
street
to
take
you
for
a
secretary
and
i
take
you
very
good
bad
murmured
the
secretary
do
you
say
asked
mr
boffin
snapping
at
him
again
he
returned
no
answer
mr
boffin
after
eyeing
him
with
a
comical
look
of
discomfited
curiosity
was
fain
to
begin
afresh
rokesmith
is
a
needy
young
man
that
i
take
for
my
secretary
out
of
the
open
street
this
rokesmith
gets
acquainted
with
my
affairs
and
gets
to
know
that
i
mean
to
settle
a
sum
of
money
on
this
young
lady
oho
says
this
rokesmith
here
mr
boffin
clapped
a
finger
against
his
nose
and
tapped
it
several
times
with
a
sneaking
air
as
embodying
rokesmith
confidentially
confabulating
with
his
own
nose
this
will
be
a
good
haul
i
go
in
for
this
and
so
this
rokesmith
greedy
and
hungering
begins
on
his
hands
and
knees
towards
the
money
not
so
bad
a
speculation
either
for
if
this
young
lady
had
had
less
spirit
or
had
had
less
sense
through
being
at
all
in
the
romantic
line
by
george
he
might
have
worked
it
out
and
made
it
pay
but
fortunately
she
was
too
many
for
him
and
a
pretty
figure
he
cuts
now
he
is
exposed
there
he
stands
said
mr
boffin
addressing
rokesmith
himself
with
ridiculous
inconsistency
at
him
unfortunate
suspicions
mr
boffin
began
the
secretary
unfortunate
for
you
i
can
tell
you
said
mr
are
not
to
be
combated
by
any
one
and
i
address
myself
to
no
such
hopeless
task
but
i
will
say
a
word
upon
the
truth
much
you
care
about
the
truth
said
mr
boffin
with
a
snap
of
his
fingers
my
dear
love
expostulated
his
wife
lady
returned
mr
boffin
keep
still
i
say
to
this
rokesmith
here
much
he
cares
about
the
truth
i
tell
him
again
much
he
cares
about
the
truth
connexion
being
at
an
end
mr
boffin
said
the
secretary
can
be
of
very
little
moment
to
me
what
you
say
you
are
knowing
enough
retorted
mr
boffin
with
a
sly
look
have
found
out
that
our
connexion
at
an
end
eh
but
you
ca
get
beforehand
with
me
look
at
this
in
my
hand
this
is
your
pay
on
your
discharge
you
can
only
follow
suit
you
ca
deprive
me
of
the
lead
let
have
no
pretending
that
you
discharge
yourself
i
discharge
you
that
i
go
remarked
the
secretary
waving
the
point
aside
with
his
hand
is
all
one
to
me
it
said
mr
boffin
it
two
to
me
let
me
tell
you
allowing
a
fellow
that
found
out
to
discharge
himself
is
one
thing
discharging
him
for
insolence
and
presumption
and
likewise
for
designs
upon
his
master
money
is
another
one
and
one
two
not
one
old
lady
do
you
cut
in
you
keep
still
you
said
all
you
wish
to
say
to
me
demanded
the
secretary
do
know
whether
i
have
or
not
answered
mr
boffin
depends
you
will
consider
whether
there
are
any
other
strong
expressions
that
you
would
like
to
bestow
upon
me
consider
that
said
mr
boffin
obstinately
my
convenience
and
not
at
yours
you
want
the
last
word
it
may
not
be
suitable
to
let
you
have
it
my
dear
dear
noddy
you
sound
so
hard
cried
poor
mrs
boffin
not
to
be
quite
repressed
lady
said
her
husband
but
without
harshness
you
cut
in
when
requested
not
i
get
a
pillow
and
carry
you
out
of
the
room
upon
it
what
do
you
want
to
say
you
rokesmith
you
mr
boffin
nothing
but
to
miss
wilfer
and
to
your
good
kind
wife
a
word
with
it
then
replied
mr
boffin
cut
it
short
for
we
had
enough
of
you
have
borne
said
the
secretary
in
a
low
voice
my
false
position
here
that
i
might
not
be
separated
from
miss
wilfer
to
be
near
her
has
been
a
recompense
to
me
from
day
to
day
even
for
the
undeserved
treatment
i
have
had
here
and
for
the
degraded
aspect
in
which
she
has
often
seen
me
since
miss
wilfer
rejected
me
i
have
never
again
urged
my
suit
to
the
best
of
my
belief
with
a
spoken
syllable
or
a
look
but
i
have
never
changed
in
my
devotion
to
her
except
if
she
will
forgive
my
saying
so
that
it
is
deeper
than
it
was
and
better
founded
mark
this
chap
saying
miss
wilfer
when
he
means
cried
mr
boffin
with
a
cunning
wink
mark
this
chap
making
miss
wilfer
stand
for
pounds
shillings
and
pence
feeling
for
miss
wilfer
pursued
the
secretary
without
deigning
to
notice
him
not
one
to
be
ashamed
of
i
avow
it
i
love
her
let
me
go
where
i
may
when
i
presently
leave
this
house
i
shall
go
into
a
blank
life
leaving
her
behind
me
said
mr
boffin
by
way
of
commentary
with
another
wink
i
am
incapable
the
secretary
went
on
still
without
heeding
him
a
mercenary
project
or
a
mercenary
thought
in
connexion
with
miss
wilfer
is
nothing
meritorious
in
me
because
any
prize
that
i
could
put
before
my
fancy
would
sink
into
insignificance
beside
her
if
the
greatest
wealth
or
the
highest
rank
were
hers
it
would
only
be
important
in
my
sight
as
removing
her
still
farther
from
me
and
making
me
more
hopeless
if
that
could
be
say
remarked
the
secretary
looking
full
at
his
late
master
that
with
a
word
she
could
strip
mr
boffin
of
his
fortune
and
take
possession
of
it
she
would
be
of
no
greater
worth
in
my
eyes
than
she
is
do
you
think
by
this
time
old
lady
asked
mr
boffin
turning
to
his
wife
in
a
bantering
tone
this
rokesmith
here
and
his
caring
for
the
truth
you
need
say
what
you
think
my
dear
because
i
want
you
to
cut
in
but
you
can
think
it
all
the
same
as
to
taking
possession
of
my
property
i
warrant
you
he
would
do
that
himself
if
he
could
returned
the
secretary
with
another
full
look
ha
ha
laughed
mr
boffin
nothing
like
a
good
while
you
are
about
it
have
been
for
a
moment
said
the
secretary
turning
from
him
and
falling
into
his
former
manner
from
the
little
i
have
to
say
my
interest
in
miss
wilfer
began
when
i
first
saw
her
even
began
when
i
had
only
heard
of
her
it
was
in
fact
the
cause
of
my
throwing
myself
in
mr
boffin
way
and
entering
his
service
miss
wilfer
has
never
known
this
until
now
i
mention
it
now
only
as
a
corroboration
though
i
hope
it
may
be
needless
of
my
being
free
from
the
sordid
design
attributed
to
me
this
is
a
very
artful
dog
said
mr
boffin
with
a
deep
look
is
a
schemer
than
i
thought
him
see
how
patiently
and
methodically
he
goes
to
work
he
gets
to
know
about
me
and
my
property
and
about
this
young
lady
and
her
share
in
poor
young
story
and
he
puts
this
and
that
together
and
he
says
to
himself
get
in
with
boffin
and
i
get
in
with
this
young
lady
and
i
work
both
at
the
same
time
and
i
bring
my
pigs
to
market
i
hear
him
say
it
bless
you
i
look
at
him
now
and
i
see
him
say
it
mr
boffin
pointed
at
the
culprit
as
it
were
in
the
act
and
hugged
himself
in
his
great
penetration
luckily
he
had
to
deal
with
the
people
he
supposed
bella
my
dear
said
mr
boffin
luckily
he
had
to
deal
with
you
and
with
me
and
with
daniel
and
miss
dancer
and
with
elwes
and
with
vulture
hopkins
and
with
blewbury
jones
and
all
the
rest
of
us
one
down
come
on
and
he
beat
that
what
he
is
regularly
beat
he
thought
to
squeeze
money
out
of
us
and
he
has
done
for
himself
instead
bella
my
dear
bella
my
dear
made
no
response
gave
no
sign
of
acquiescence
when
she
had
first
covered
her
face
she
had
sunk
upon
a
chair
with
her
hands
resting
on
the
back
of
it
and
had
never
moved
since
there
was
a
short
silence
at
this
point
and
mrs
boffin
softly
rose
as
if
to
go
to
her
but
mr
boffin
stopped
her
with
a
gesture
and
she
obediently
sat
down
again
and
stayed
where
she
was
your
pay
mister
rokesmith
said
the
golden
dustman
jerking
the
folded
scrap
of
paper
he
had
in
his
hand
towards
his
late
secretary
dare
say
you
can
stoop
to
pick
it
up
after
what
you
have
stooped
to
here
have
stooped
to
nothing
but
this
rokesmith
answered
as
he
took
it
from
the
ground
this
is
mine
for
i
have
earned
it
by
the
hardest
of
hard
labour
a
pretty
quick
packer
i
hope
said
mr
boffin
the
sooner
you
are
gone
bag
and
baggage
the
better
for
all
parties
need
have
no
fear
of
my
lingering
just
one
thing
though
said
mr
boffin
i
should
like
to
ask
you
before
we
come
to
a
good
riddance
if
it
was
only
to
show
this
young
lady
how
conceited
you
schemers
are
in
thinking
that
nobody
finds
out
how
you
contradict
yourselves
me
anything
you
wish
to
ask
returned
rokesmith
use
the
expedition
that
you
recommend
pretend
to
have
a
mighty
admiration
for
this
young
lady
said
mr
boffin
laying
his
hand
protectingly
on
bella
head
without
looking
down
at
her
do
not
pretend
well
you
have
a
mighty
admiration
for
this
young
lady
since
you
are
so
particular
do
you
reconcile
that
with
this
young
lady
being
a
improvident
idiot
not
knowing
what
was
due
to
herself
flinging
up
her
money
to
the
and
racing
off
at
a
splitting
pace
for
the
workhouse
do
understand
you
you
or
wo
you
what
else
could
you
have
made
this
young
lady
out
to
be
if
she
had
listened
to
such
addresses
as
yours
else
if
i
had
been
so
happy
as
to
win
her
affections
and
possess
her
heart
her
affections
retorted
mr
boffin
with
ineffable
contempt
possess
her
heart
mew
says
the
cat
says
the
duck
says
the
dog
win
her
affections
and
possess
her
heart
mew
john
rokesmith
stared
at
him
in
his
outburst
as
if
with
some
faint
idea
that
he
had
gone
mad
is
due
to
this
young
lady
said
mr
boffin
money
and
this
young
lady
right
well
knows
it
slander
the
young
lady
slander
the
young
lady
you
with
your
affections
and
hearts
and
trumpery
returned
mr
boffin
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
of
your
behaviour
i
heard
of
these
doings
of
yours
only
last
night
or
you
should
have
heard
of
from
me
sooner
take
your
oath
of
it
i
heard
of
from
a
lady
with
as
good
a
headpiece
as
the
best
and
she
knows
this
young
lady
and
i
know
this
young
lady
and
we
all
three
know
that
it
money
she
makes
a
stand
for
money
money
money
and
that
you
and
your
affections
and
hearts
are
a
lie
sir
boffin
said
rokesmith
quietly
turning
to
her
your
delicate
and
unvarying
kindness
i
thank
you
with
the
warmest
gratitude
miss
wilfer
now
my
dear
said
mr
boffin
laying
his
hand
on
bella
head
again
may
begin
to
make
yourself
quite
comfortable
and
i
hope
you
feel
that
you
been
righted
but
bella
was
so
far
from
appearing
to
feel
it
that
she
shrank
from
his
hand
and
from
the
chair
and
starting
up
in
an
incoherent
passion
of
tears
and
stretching
out
her
arms
cried
mr
rokesmith
before
you
go
if
you
could
but
make
me
poor
again
o
make
me
poor
again
somebody
i
beg
and
pray
or
my
heart
will
break
if
this
goes
on
pa
dear
make
me
poor
again
and
take
me
home
i
was
bad
enough
there
but
i
have
been
so
much
worse
here

give
me
money
mr
boffin
i
have
money
keep
it
away
from
me
and
only
let
me
speak
to
good
little
pa
and
lay
my
head
upon
his
shoulder
and
tell
him
all
my
griefs
nobody
else
can
understand
me
nobody
else
can
comfort
me
nobody
else
knows
how
unworthy
i
am
and
yet
can
love
me
like
a
little
child
i
am
better
with
pa
than
any
one
more
innocent
more
sorry
more
glad
so
crying
out
in
a
wild
way
that
she
could
not
bear
this
bella
drooped
her
head
on
mrs
boffin
ready
breast
john
rokesmith
from
his
place
in
the
room
and
mr
boffin
from
his
looked
on
at
her
in
silence
until
she
was
silent
herself
then
mr
boffin
observed
in
a
soothing
and
comfortable
tone
my
dear
there
you
are
righted
now
and
it
all
right
i
do
wonder
i
sure
at
your
being
a
little
flurried
by
having
a
scene
with
this
fellow
but
it
all
over
my
dear
and
you
righted
and
it
and
it
all
right
which
mr
boffin
repeated
with
a
highly
satisfied
air
of
completeness
and
finality
hate
you
cried
bella
turning
suddenly
upon
him
with
a
stamp
of
her
little
foot
least
i
ca
hate
you
but
i
do
like
you
lo
exclaimed
mr
boffin
in
an
amazed
a
scolding
unjust
abusive
aggravating
bad
old
creature
cried
bella
am
angry
with
my
ungrateful
self
for
calling
you
names
but
you
are
you
are
you
know
you
are
mr
boffin
stared
here
and
stared
there
as
misdoubting
that
he
must
be
in
some
sort
of
fit
have
heard
you
with
shame
said
bella
shame
for
myself
and
with
shame
for
you
you
ought
to
be
above
the
base
of
a
woman
but
you
are
above
nothing
now
mr
boffin
seeming
to
become
convinced
that
this
was
a
fit
rolled
his
eyes
and
loosened
his
neckcloth
i
came
here
i
respected
you
and
honoured
you
and
i
soon
loved
you
cried
bella
now
i
ca
bear
the
sight
of
you
at
least
i
do
know
that
i
ought
to
go
so
far
as
that
only
you
a
you
a
monster
having
shot
this
bolt
out
with
a
great
expenditure
of
force
bella
hysterically
laughed
and
cried
together
best
wish
i
can
wish
you
is
said
bella
returning
to
the
charge
you
had
not
one
single
farthing
in
the
world
if
any
true
friend
and
could
make
you
a
bankrupt
you
would
be
a
duck
but
as
a
man
of
property
you
are
a
demon
after
despatching
this
second
bolt
with
a
still
greater
expenditure
of
force
bella
laughed
and
cried
still
more
rokesmith
pray
stay
one
moment
pray
hear
one
word
from
me
before
you
go
i
am
deeply
sorry
for
the
reproaches
you
have
borne
on
my
account
out
of
the
depths
of
my
heart
i
earnestly
and
truly
beg
your
pardon
as
she
stepped
towards
him
he
met
her
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
he
put
it
to
his
lips
and
said
bless
you
no
laughing
was
mixed
with
bella
crying
then
her
tears
were
pure
and
fervent
is
not
an
ungenerous
word
that
i
have
heard
addressed
to
you
heard
with
scorn
and
indignation
mr
rokesmith
but
it
has
wounded
me
far
more
than
you
for
i
have
deserved
it
and
you
never
have
mr
rokesmith
it
is
to
me
you
owe
this
perverted
account
of
what
passed
between
us
that
night
i
parted
with
the
secret
even
while
i
was
angry
with
myself
for
doing
so
it
was
very
bad
in
me
but
indeed
it
was
not
wicked
i
did
it
in
a
moment
of
conceit
and
folly
one
of
my
many
such
moments
one
of
my
many
such
hours
years
as
i
am
punished
for
it
severely
try
to
forgive
it
do
with
all
my
soul
you
o
thank
you
do
part
from
me
till
i
have
said
one
other
word
to
do
you
justice
the
only
fault
you
can
be
truly
charged
with
in
having
spoken
to
me
as
you
did
that
night
with
how
much
delicacy
and
how
much
forbearance
no
one
but
i
can
know
or
be
grateful
to
you
for
is
that
you
laid
yourself
open
to
be
slighted
by
a
worldly
shallow
girl
whose
head
was
turned
and
who
was
quite
unable
to
rise
to
the
worth
of
what
you
offered
her
mr
rokesmith
that
girl
has
often
seen
herself
in
a
pitiful
and
poor
light
since
but
never
in
so
pitiful
and
poor
a
light
as
now
when
the
mean
tone
in
which
she
answered
you
sordid
and
vain
girl
that
she
was
has
been
echoed
in
her
ears
by
mr
boffin
he
kissed
her
hand
again
boffin
speeches
were
detestable
to
me
shocking
to
me
said
bella
startling
that
gentleman
with
another
stamp
of
her
little
foot
is
quite
true
that
there
was
a
time
and
very
lately
when
i
deserved
to
be
so
righted
mr
rokesmith
but
i
hope
that
i
shall
never
deserve
it
again
he
once
more
put
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
then
relinquished
it
and
left
the
room
bella
was
hurrying
back
to
the
chair
in
which
she
had
hidden
her
face
so
long
when
catching
sight
of
mrs
boffin
by
the
way
she
stopped
at
her
is
gone
sobbed
bella
indignantly
despairingly
in
fifty
ways
at
once
with
her
arms
round
mrs
neck
has
been
most
shamefully
abused
and
most
unjustly
and
most
basely
driven
away
and
i
am
the
cause
of
it
all
this
time
mr
boffin
had
been
rolling
his
eyes
over
his
loosened
neckerchief
as
if
his
fit
were
still
upon
him
appearing
now
to
think
that
he
was
coming
to
he
stared
straight
before
him
for
a
while
tied
his
neckerchief
again
took
several
long
inspirations
swallowed
several
times
and
ultimately
exclaimed
with
a
deep
sigh
as
if
he
felt
himself
on
the
whole
better
no
word
good
or
bad
did
mrs
boffin
say
but
she
tenderly
took
care
of
bella
and
glanced
at
her
husband
as
if
for
orders
mr
boffin
without
imparting
any
took
his
seat
on
a
chair
over
against
them
and
there
sat
leaning
forward
with
a
fixed
countenance
his
legs
apart
a
hand
on
each
knee
and
his
elbows
squared
until
bella
should
dry
her
eyes
and
raise
her
head
which
in
the
fulness
of
time
she
did
must
go
home
said
bella
rising
hurriedly
am
very
grateful
to
you
for
all
you
have
done
for
me
but
i
ca
stay
here
darling
girl
remonstrated
mrs
boffin
i
ca
stay
here
said
bella
ca
ugh
you
vicious
old
thing
this
to
mr
boffin
be
rash
my
love
urged
mrs
boffin
well
of
what
you
do
you
had
better
think
well
said
mr
boffin
shall
never
more
think
well
of
you
cried
bella
cutting
him
short
with
intense
defiance
in
her
expressive
little
eyebrows
and
championship
of
the
late
secretary
in
every
dimple
never
again
your
money
has
changed
you
to
marble
you
are
a
miser
you
are
worse
than
dancer
worse
than
hopkins
worse
than
blackberry
jones
worse
than
any
of
the
wretches
and
more
proceeded
bella
breaking
into
tears
again
were
wholly
undeserving
of
the
gentleman
you
have
lost
you
do
mean
to
say
miss
bella
the
golden
dustman
slowly
remonstrated
you
set
up
rokesmith
against
me
do
said
bella
is
worth
a
million
of
you
very
pretty
she
looked
though
very
angry
as
she
made
herself
as
tall
as
she
possibly
could
which
was
not
extremely
tall
and
utterly
renounced
her
patron
with
a
lofty
toss
of
her
rich
brown
head
would
rather
he
thought
well
of
me
said
bella
he
swept
the
street
for
bread
than
that
you
did
though
you
splashed
the
mud
upon
him
from
the
wheels
of
a
chariot
of
pure
there
i
sure
cried
mr
boffin
staring
for
a
long
time
past
when
you
have
thought
you
set
yourself
above
him
i
have
only
seen
you
under
his
feet
said
bella
and
throughout
i
saw
in
him
the
master
and
i
saw
in
you
the
man
there
and
when
you
used
him
shamefully
i
took
his
part
and
loved
him
there
i
boast
of
it
after
which
strong
avowal
bella
underwent
reaction
and
cried
to
any
extent
with
her
face
on
the
back
of
her
chair
look
here
said
mr
boffin
as
soon
as
he
could
find
an
opening
for
breaking
the
silence
and
striking
in
me
your
attention
bella
i
am
not
angry
am
said
bella
say
resumed
the
golden
dustman
am
not
angry
and
i
mean
kindly
to
you
and
i
want
to
overlook
this
so
you
stay
where
you
are
and
we
agree
to
say
no
more
about
it
i
ca
stay
here
cried
bella
rising
hurriedly
again
think
of
staying
here
i
must
go
home
for
good
do
be
silly
mr
boffin
reasoned
do
what
you
undo
do
do
what
you
sure
to
be
sorry
for
shall
never
be
sorry
for
it
said
bella
i
should
always
be
sorry
and
should
every
minute
of
my
life
despise
myself
if
i
remained
here
after
what
has
happened
least
bella
argued
mr
boffin
there
be
no
mistake
about
it
look
before
you
leap
you
know
stay
where
you
are
and
all
well
and
all
as
it
was
to
be
go
away
and
you
can
never
come
back
know
that
i
can
never
come
back
and
that
what
i
mean
said
bella
must
expect
mr
boffin
pursued
i
to
settle
money
on
you
if
you
leave
us
like
this
because
i
am
not
no
bella
be
careful
not
one
brass
farthing
said
bella
haughtily
you
think
that
any
power
on
earth
could
make
me
take
it
if
you
did
sir
but
there
was
mrs
boffin
to
part
from
and
in
the
full
flush
of
her
dignity
the
impressible
little
soul
collapsed
again
down
upon
her
knees
before
that
good
woman
she
rocked
herself
upon
her
breast
and
cried
and
sobbed
and
folded
her
in
her
arms
with
all
her
might
a
dear
a
dear
the
best
of
dears
cried
bella
the
best
of
human
creatures
i
can
never
be
thankful
enough
to
you
and
i
can
never
forget
you
if
i
should
live
to
be
blind
and
deaf
i
know
i
shall
see
and
hear
you
in
my
fancy
to
the
last
of
my
dim
old
days
mrs
boffin
wept
most
heartily
and
embraced
her
with
all
fondness
but
said
not
one
single
word
except
that
she
was
her
dear
girl
she
said
that
often
enough
to
be
sure
for
she
said
it
over
and
over
again
but
not
one
word
else
bella
broke
from
her
at
length
and
was
going
weeping
out
of
the
room
when
in
her
own
little
queer
affectionate
way
she
half
relented
towards
mr
boffin
am
very
glad
sobbed
bella
i
called
you
names
sir
because
you
richly
deserved
it
but
i
am
very
sorry
that
i
called
you
names
because
you
used
to
be
so
different
say
said
mr
boffin
shortly
i
knew
which
of
your
hands
was
the
least
spoilt
i
would
ask
you
to
let
me
touch
it
said
bella
the
last
time
but
not
because
i
repent
of
what
i
have
said
to
you
for
i
do
it
true
the
left
hand
said
mr
boffin
holding
it
out
in
a
stolid
manner
the
least
used
have
been
wonderfully
good
and
kind
to
me
said
bella
i
kiss
it
for
that
you
have
been
as
bad
as
bad
could
be
to
mr
rokesmith
and
i
throw
it
away
for
that
thank
you
for
myself
and
said
mr
boffin
as
before
bella
caught
him
round
the
neck
and
kissed
him
and
ran
out
for
ever
she
ran
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
in
her
own
room
and
cried
abundantly
but
the
day
was
declining
and
she
had
no
time
to
lose
she
opened
all
the
places
where
she
kept
her
dresses
selected
only
those
she
had
brought
with
her
leaving
all
the
rest
and
made
a
great
misshapen
bundle
of
them
to
be
sent
for
afterwards
wo
take
one
of
the
others
said
bella
tying
the
knots
of
the
bundle
very
tight
in
the
severity
of
her
resolution
leave
all
the
presents
behind
and
begin
again
entirely
on
my
own
account
that
the
resolution
might
be
thoroughly
carried
into
practice
she
even
changed
the
dress
she
wore
for
that
in
which
she
had
come
to
the
grand
mansion
even
the
bonnet
she
put
on
was
the
bonnet
that
had
mounted
into
the
boffin
chariot
at
holloway
i
am
complete
said
bella
a
little
trying
but
i
have
steeped
my
eyes
in
cold
water
and
i
wo
cry
any
more
you
have
been
a
pleasant
room
to
me
dear
room
adieu
we
shall
never
see
each
other
again
with
a
parting
kiss
of
her
fingers
to
it
she
softly
closed
the
door
and
went
with
a
light
foot
down
the
great
staircase
pausing
and
listening
as
she
went
that
she
might
meet
none
of
the
household
no
one
chanced
to
be
about
and
she
got
down
to
the
hall
in
quiet
the
door
of
the
late
secretary
room
stood
open
she
peeped
in
as
she
passed
and
divined
from
the
emptiness
of
his
table
and
the
general
appearance
of
things
that
he
was
already
gone
softly
opening
the
great
hall
door
and
softly
closing
it
upon
herself
she
turned
and
kissed
it
on
the
outside
insensible
old
combination
of
wood
and
iron
that
it
was
before
she
ran
away
from
the
house
at
a
swift
pace
was
well
done
panted
bella
slackening
in
the
next
street
and
subsiding
into
a
walk
i
had
left
myself
any
breath
to
cry
with
i
should
have
cried
again
now
poor
dear
darling
little
pa
you
are
going
to
see
your
lovely
woman
unexpectedly
chapter
the
feast
of
the
three
hobgoblins
the
city
looked
unpromising
enough
as
bella
made
her
way
along
its
gritty
streets
most
of
its
were
slackening
sail
or
had
left
off
grinding
for
the
day
the
had
already
departed
and
the
journeymen
were
departing
there
was
a
jaded
aspect
on
the
business
lanes
and
courts
and
the
very
pavements
had
a
weary
appearance
confused
by
the
tread
of
a
million
of
feet
there
must
be
hours
of
night
to
temper
down
the
day
distraction
of
so
feverish
a
place
as
yet
the
worry
of
the
whirling
and
grinding
on
the
part
of
the
seemed
to
linger
in
the
air
and
the
quiet
was
more
like
the
prostration
of
a
spent
giant
than
the
repose
of
one
who
was
renewing
his
strength
if
bella
thought
as
she
glanced
at
the
mighty
bank
how
agreeable
it
would
be
to
have
an
hour
gardening
there
with
a
bright
copper
shovel
among
the
money
still
she
was
not
in
an
avaricious
vein
much
improved
in
that
respect
and
with
certain
images
which
had
little
gold
in
their
composition
dancing
before
her
bright
eyes
she
arrived
in
the
region
of
mincing
lane
with
the
sensation
of
having
just
opened
a
drawer
in
a
chemist
shop
the
of
chicksey
veneering
and
stobbles
was
pointed
out
by
an
elderly
female
accustomed
to
the
care
of
offices
who
dropped
upon
bella
out
of
a
wiping
her
mouth
and
accounted
for
its
humidity
on
natural
principles
well
known
to
the
physical
sciences
by
explaining
that
she
had
looked
in
at
the
door
to
see
what
it
was
the
was
a
ground
floor
by
a
dark
gateway
and
bella
was
considering
as
she
approached
it
could
there
be
any
precedent
in
the
city
for
her
going
in
and
asking
for
wilfer
when
whom
should
she
see
sitting
at
one
of
the
windows
with
the
sash
raised
but
wilfer
himself
preparing
to
take
a
slight
refection
on
approaching
nearer
bella
discerned
that
the
refection
had
the
appearance
of
a
small
and
a
pennyworth
of
milk
simultaneously
with
this
discovery
on
her
part
her
father
discovered
her
and
invoked
the
echoes
of
mincing
lane
to
exclaim
gracious
me
he
then
came
cherubically
flying
out
without
a
hat
and
embraced
her
and
handed
her
in
it
after
hours
and
i
am
all
alone
my
dear
he
explained
am
having
as
i
sometimes
do
when
they
are
all
gone
a
quiet
tea
looking
round
the
office
as
if
her
father
were
a
captive
and
this
his
cell
bella
hugged
him
and
choked
him
to
her
heart
content
never
was
so
surprised
my
dear
said
her
father
believe
my
eyes
upon
my
life
i
thought
they
had
taken
to
lying
the
idea
of
your
coming
down
the
lane
yourself
why
did
you
send
the
footman
down
the
lane
my
dear
have
brought
no
footman
with
me
indeed
but
you
have
brought
the
elegant
my
love
never
can
have
walked
my
dear
i
have
he
looked
so
very
much
astonished
that
bella
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
break
it
to
him
just
yet
consequence
is
pa
that
your
lovely
woman
feels
a
little
faint
and
would
very
much
like
to
share
your
tea
the
cottage
loaf
and
the
pennyworth
of
milk
had
been
set
forth
on
a
sheet
of
paper
on
the
the
cherubic
with
the
first
bit
of
the
loaf
still
on
its
point
lay
beside
them
where
it
had
been
hastily
thrown
down
bella
took
the
bit
off
and
put
it
in
her
mouth
dear
child
said
her
father
idea
of
your
partaking
of
such
lowly
fare
but
at
least
you
must
have
your
own
loaf
and
your
own
one
moment
my
dear
the
dairy
is
just
over
the
way
and
round
the
corner
regardless
of
bella
dissuasions
he
ran
out
and
quickly
returned
with
the
new
supply
dear
child
he
said
as
he
spread
it
on
another
piece
of
paper
before
her
idea
of
a
splendid
and
then
looked
at
her
figure
and
stopped
short
the
matter
pa
of
a
splendid
female
he
resumed
more
slowly
up
with
such
accommodation
as
the
present
is
that
a
new
dress
you
have
on
my
dear
pa
an
old
one
do
you
remember
it
i
thought
i
remembered
it
my
dear
should
for
you
bought
it
i
thought
i
bought
it
my
dear
said
the
cherub
giving
himself
a
little
shake
as
if
to
rouse
his
faculties
have
you
grown
so
fickle
that
you
do
like
your
own
taste
pa
dear
my
love
he
returned
swallowing
a
bit
of
the
cottage
loaf
with
considerable
effort
for
it
seemed
to
stick
by
the
way
should
have
thought
it
was
hardly
sufficiently
splendid
for
existing
circumstances
so
pa
said
bella
moving
coaxingly
to
his
side
instead
of
remaining
opposite
sometimes
have
a
quiet
tea
here
all
alone
i
am
not
in
the
tea
way
if
i
draw
my
arm
over
your
shoulder
like
this
pa
my
dear
and
no
my
dear
yes
to
the
first
question
and
certainly
not
to
the
second
respecting
the
quiet
tea
my
dear
why
you
see
the
occupations
of
the
day
are
sometimes
a
little
wearing
and
if
nothing
interposed
between
the
day
and
your
mother
why
she
is
sometimes
a
little
wearing
too
know
my
dear
so
sometimes
i
put
a
quiet
tea
at
the
window
here
with
a
little
quiet
contemplation
of
the
lane
which
comes
soothing
between
the
day
and
domestic
suggested
bella
sorrowfully
domestic
bliss
said
her
father
quite
contented
to
accept
the
phrase
bella
kissed
him
it
is
in
this
dark
dingy
place
of
captivity
poor
dear
that
you
pass
all
the
hours
of
your
life
when
you
are
not
at
home
at
home
or
not
on
the
road
there
or
on
the
road
here
my
love
yes
you
see
that
little
desk
in
the
corner
the
dark
corner
furthest
both
from
the
light
and
from
the
fireplace
the
shabbiest
desk
of
all
the
desks
does
it
really
strike
you
in
that
point
of
view
my
dear
said
her
father
surveying
it
artistically
with
his
head
on
one
side
mine
that
called
rumty
perch
perch
asked
bella
with
great
indignation
you
see
being
rather
high
and
up
two
steps
they
call
it
a
perch
and
they
call
me
rumty
dare
they
exclaimed
bella
playful
bella
my
dear
they
playful
they
more
or
less
younger
than
i
am
and
they
playful
what
does
it
matter
it
might
be
surly
or
sulky
or
fifty
disagreeable
things
that
i
really
like
to
be
considered
but
rumty
lor
why
not
rumty
to
inflict
a
heavy
disappointment
on
this
sweet
nature
which
had
been
through
all
her
caprices
the
object
of
her
recognition
love
and
admiration
from
infancy
bella
felt
to
be
the
hardest
task
of
her
hard
day
should
have
done
better
she
thought
tell
him
at
first
i
should
have
done
better
to
tell
him
just
now
when
he
had
some
slight
misgiving
he
is
quite
happy
again
and
i
shall
make
him
wretched
he
was
falling
back
on
his
loaf
and
milk
with
the
pleasantest
composure
and
bella
stealing
her
arm
a
little
closer
about
him
and
at
the
same
time
sticking
up
his
hair
with
an
irresistible
propensity
to
play
with
him
founded
on
the
habit
of
her
whole
life
had
prepared
herself
to
say
dear
do
be
cast
down
but
i
must
tell
you
something
disagreeable
when
he
interrupted
her
in
an
manner
gracious
me
he
exclaimed
invoking
the
mincing
lane
echoes
as
before
is
very
extraordinary
is
pa
here
mr
rokesmith
now
no
pa
no
cried
bella
greatly
flurried
not
there
is
look
here
sooth
to
say
mr
rokesmith
not
only
passed
the
window
but
came
into
the
and
not
only
came
into
the
but
finding
himself
alone
there
with
bella
and
her
father
rushed
at
bella
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
with
the
rapturous
words
dear
dear
girl
my
gallant
generous
disinterested
courageous
noble
girl
and
not
only
that
even
which
one
might
have
thought
astonishment
enough
for
one
dose
but
bella
after
hanging
her
head
for
a
moment
lifted
it
up
and
laid
it
on
his
breast
as
if
that
were
her
head
chosen
and
lasting
knew
you
would
come
to
him
and
i
followed
you
said
rokesmith
love
my
life
you
are
mine
to
which
bella
responded
i
am
yours
if
you
think
me
worth
taking
and
after
that
seemed
to
shrink
to
next
to
nothing
in
the
clasp
of
his
arms
partly
because
it
was
such
a
strong
one
on
his
part
and
partly
because
there
was
such
a
yielding
to
it
on
hers
the
cherub
whose
hair
would
have
done
for
itself
under
the
influence
of
this
amazing
spectacle
what
bella
had
just
now
done
for
it
staggered
back
into
the
from
which
he
had
risen
and
surveyed
the
pair
with
his
eyes
dilated
to
their
utmost
we
must
think
of
dear
pa
said
bella
have
told
dear
pa
let
us
speak
to
upon
which
they
turned
to
do
so
wish
first
my
dear
remarked
the
cherub
faintly
you
have
the
kindness
to
sprinkle
me
with
a
little
milk
for
i
feel
as
if
i
was
going
in
fact
the
good
little
fellow
had
become
alarmingly
limp
and
his
senses
seemed
to
be
rapidly
escaping
from
the
knees
upward
bella
sprinkled
him
with
kisses
instead
of
milk
but
gave
him
a
little
of
that
article
to
drink
and
he
gradually
revived
under
her
caressing
care
break
it
to
you
gently
dearest
pa
said
bella
dear
returned
the
cherub
looking
at
them
both
broke
so
much
in
the
first
gush
if
i
may
so
express
myself
that
i
think
i
am
equal
to
a
good
large
breakage
now
wilfer
said
john
rokesmith
excitedly
and
joyfully
takes
me
though
i
have
no
fortune
even
no
present
occupation
nothing
but
what
i
can
get
in
the
life
before
us
bella
takes
me
i
should
rather
have
inferred
my
dear
sir
returned
the
cherub
feebly
bella
took
you
from
what
i
have
within
these
few
minutes
remarked
do
know
pa
said
bella
ill
i
have
used
him
do
know
sir
said
rokesmith
a
heart
she
has
do
know
pa
said
bella
a
shocking
creature
i
was
growing
when
he
saved
me
from
myself
do
know
sir
said
rokesmith
a
sacrifice
she
has
made
for
me
dear
bella
replied
the
cherub
still
pathetically
scared
my
dear
john
rokesmith
if
you
will
allow
me
so
to
call
you
do
pa
do
urged
bella
allow
you
and
my
will
is
his
law
is
it
dear
john
rokesmith
there
was
an
engaging
shyness
in
bella
coupled
with
an
engaging
tenderness
of
love
and
confidence
and
pride
in
thus
first
calling
him
by
name
which
made
it
quite
excusable
in
john
rokesmith
to
do
what
he
did
what
he
did
was
once
more
to
give
her
the
appearance
of
vanishing
as
aforesaid
think
my
dears
observed
the
cherub
if
you
could
make
it
convenient
to
sit
one
on
one
side
of
me
and
the
other
on
the
other
we
should
get
on
rather
more
consecutively
and
make
things
rather
plainer
john
rokesmith
mentioned
a
while
ago
that
he
had
no
present
occupation
said
rokesmith
pa
none
said
bella
which
i
argue
proceeded
the
cherub
he
has
left
mr
boffin
and
so
a
bit
my
dear
i
wish
to
lead
up
to
it
by
degrees
and
that
mr
boffin
has
not
treated
him
well
treated
him
most
shamefully
dear
pa
cried
bella
with
a
flashing
face
which
pursued
the
cherub
enjoining
patience
with
his
hand
certain
mercenary
young
person
distantly
related
to
myself
could
not
approve
am
i
leading
up
to
it
right
not
approve
sweet
pa
said
bella
with
a
tearful
laugh
and
a
joyful
kiss
which
pursued
the
cherub
certain
mercenary
young
person
distantly
related
to
myself
having
previously
observed
and
mentioned
to
myself
that
prosperity
was
spoiling
mr
boffin
felt
that
she
must
not
sell
her
sense
of
what
was
right
and
what
was
wrong
and
what
was
true
and
what
was
false
and
what
was
just
and
what
was
unjust
for
any
price
that
could
be
paid
to
her
by
any
one
alive
am
i
leading
up
to
it
right
with
another
tearful
laugh
bella
joyfully
kissed
him
again
therefore
and
therefore
the
cherub
went
on
in
a
glowing
voice
as
bella
hand
stole
gradually
up
his
waistcoat
to
his
neck
mercenary
young
person
distantly
related
to
myself
refused
the
price
took
off
the
splendid
fashions
that
were
part
of
it
put
on
the
comparatively
poor
dress
that
i
had
last
given
her
and
trusting
to
my
supporting
her
in
what
was
right
came
straight
to
me
have
i
led
up
to
it
bella
hand
was
round
his
neck
by
this
time
and
her
face
was
on
it
mercenary
young
person
distantly
related
to
myself
said
her
good
father
well
the
mercenary
young
person
distantly
related
to
myself
did
not
trust
to
me
in
vain
i
admire
this
mercenary
young
person
distantly
related
to
myself
more
in
this
dress
than
if
she
had
come
to
me
in
china
silks
cashmere
shawls
and
golconda
diamonds
i
love
this
young
person
dearly
i
say
to
the
man
of
this
young
heart
out
of
my
heart
and
with
all
of
it
my
blessing
on
this
engagement
betwixt
you
and
she
brings
you
a
good
fortune
when
she
brings
you
the
poverty
she
has
accepted
for
your
sake
and
the
honest
truth
the
stanch
little
man
voice
failed
him
as
he
gave
john
rokesmith
his
hand
and
he
was
silent
bending
his
face
low
over
his
daughter
but
not
for
long
he
soon
looked
up
saying
in
a
sprightly
tone
now
my
dear
child
if
you
think
you
can
entertain
john
rokesmith
for
a
minute
and
a
half
i
run
over
to
the
dairy
and
fetch
him
a
cottage
loaf
and
a
drink
of
milk
that
we
may
all
have
tea
together
it
was
as
bella
gaily
said
like
the
supper
provided
for
the
three
nursery
hobgoblins
at
their
house
in
the
forest
without
their
thunderous
low
growlings
of
the
alarming
discovery
been
drinking
my
milk
it
was
a
delicious
repast
by
far
the
most
delicious
that
bella
or
john
rokesmith
or
even
wilfer
had
ever
made
the
uncongenial
oddity
of
its
surroundings
with
the
two
brass
knobs
of
the
iron
safe
of
chicksey
veneering
and
stobbles
staring
from
a
corner
like
the
eyes
of
some
dull
dragon
only
made
it
the
more
delightful
think
said
the
cherub
looking
round
the
office
with
unspeakable
enjoyment
anything
of
a
tender
nature
should
come
off
here
is
what
tickles
me
to
think
that
ever
i
should
have
seen
my
bella
folded
in
the
arms
of
her
future
husband
here
you
know
it
was
not
until
the
cottage
loaves
and
the
milk
had
for
some
time
disappeared
and
the
foreshadowings
of
night
were
creeping
over
mincing
lane
that
the
cherub
by
degrees
became
a
little
nervous
and
said
to
bella
as
he
cleared
his
throat
have
you
thought
at
all
about
your
mother
my
dear
your
sister
lavvy
for
instance
my
dear
pa
i
think
we
had
better
not
enter
into
particulars
at
home
i
think
it
will
be
quite
enough
to
say
that
i
had
a
difference
with
mr
boffin
and
have
left
for
good
rokesmith
being
acquainted
with
your
ma
my
love
said
her
father
after
some
slight
hesitation
need
have
no
delicacy
in
hinting
before
him
that
you
may
perhaps
find
your
ma
a
little
wearing
little
patient
pa
said
bella
with
a
tuneful
laugh
the
tune
fuller
for
being
so
loving
in
its
tone
we
say
strictly
in
confidence
among
ourselves
wearing
we
wo
qualify
it
the
cherub
stoutly
admitted
your
temper
is
wearing
do
mind
you
must
prepare
yourself
you
know
my
precious
said
her
father
with
much
gentleness
our
looking
very
poor
and
meagre
at
home
and
being
at
the
best
but
very
uncomfortable
after
mr
boffin
house
do
mind
pa
i
could
bear
much
harder
trials
for
john
the
closing
words
were
not
so
softly
and
blushingly
said
but
that
john
heard
them
and
showed
that
he
heard
them
by
again
assisting
bella
to
another
of
those
mysterious
disappearances
said
the
cherub
gaily
and
not
expressing
disapproval
you
when
you
come
back
from
retirement
my
love
and
reappear
on
the
surface
i
think
it
will
be
time
to
lock
up
and
go
if
the
of
chicksey
veneering
and
stobbles
had
ever
been
shut
up
by
three
happier
people
glad
as
most
people
were
to
shut
it
up
they
must
have
been
superlatively
happy
indeed
but
first
bella
mounted
upon
rumty
perch
and
said
me
what
you
do
here
all
day
long
dear
do
you
write
like
this
laying
her
round
cheek
upon
her
plump
left
arm
and
losing
sight
of
her
pen
in
waves
of
hair
in
a
highly
manner
though
john
rokesmith
seemed
to
like
it
so
the
three
hobgoblins
having
effaced
all
traces
of
their
feast
and
swept
up
the
crumbs
came
out
of
mincing
lane
to
walk
to
holloway
and
if
two
of
the
hobgoblins
did
wish
the
distance
twice
as
long
as
it
was
the
third
hobgoblin
was
much
mistaken
indeed
that
modest
spirit
deemed
himself
so
much
in
the
way
of
their
deep
enjoyment
of
the
journey
that
he
apologetically
remarked
think
my
dears
i
take
the
lead
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
seem
not
to
belong
to
you
which
he
did
cherubically
strewing
the
path
with
smiles
in
the
absence
of
flowers
it
was
almost
ten
when
they
stopped
within
view
of
wilfer
castle
and
then
the
spot
being
quiet
and
deserted
bella
began
a
series
of
disappearances
which
threatened
to
last
all
night
think
john
the
cherub
hinted
at
last
if
you
can
spare
me
the
young
person
distantly
related
to
myself
i
take
her
in
ca
spare
her
answered
john
i
must
lend
her
to
my
darling
a
word
of
magic
which
caused
bella
instantly
to
disappear
again
dearest
pa
said
bella
when
she
became
visible
your
hand
in
mine
and
we
run
home
as
fast
as
ever
we
can
run
and
get
it
over
now
pa
once
dear
the
cherub
faltered
with
something
of
a
craven
air
was
going
to
observe
that
if
your
mother
must
hang
back
sir
to
gain
time
cried
bella
putting
out
her
right
foot
you
see

off
she

bearing
the
cherub
along
nor
ever
stopped
nor
suffered
him
to

she
had
pulled
at
the
bell
dear
pa
said
bella
taking
him
by
both
ears
as
if
he
were
a
pitcher
and
conveying
his
face
to
her
rosy
lips
are
in
for
it
miss
lavvy
came
out
to
open
the
gate
waited
on
by
that
attentive
cavalier
and
friend
of
the
family
mr
george
sampson
it
never
bella
exclaimed
miss
lavvy
starting
back
at
the
sight
and
then
bawled
here
bella
this
produced
before
they
could
get
into
the
house
mrs
wilfer
who
standing
in
the
portal
received
them
with
ghostly
gloom
and
all
her
other
appliances
of
ceremony
child
is
welcome
though
unlooked
for
said
she
at
the
time
presenting
her
cheek
as
if
it
were
a
cool
slate
for
visitors
to
enrol
themselves
upon
too
are
welcome
though
late
does
the
male
domestic
of
mrs
boffin
hear
me
there
this
inquiry
was
cast
forth
into
the
night
for
response
from
the
menial
in
question
is
no
one
waiting
ma
dear
said
bella
is
no
one
waiting
repeated
mrs
wilfer
in
majestic
accents
ma
dear
a
dignified
shiver
pervaded
mrs
wilfer
shoulders
and
gloves
as
who
should
say
enigma
and
then
she
marched
at
the
head
of
the
procession
to
the
family
where
she
observed
who
started
on
being
solemnly
turned
upon
have
taken
the
precaution
of
making
some
addition
to
our
frugal
supper
on
your
way
home
it
will
prove
but
a
distasteful
one
to
bella
cold
neck
of
mutton
and
a
lettuce
can
ill
compete
with
the
luxuries
of
mr
board
do
talk
like
that
ma
dear
said
bella
boffin
board
is
nothing
to
me
but
here
miss
lavinia
who
had
been
intently
eyeing
bella
bonnet
struck
in
with
bella
lavvy
i
know
the
irrepressible
lowered
her
eyes
to
bella
dress
and
stooped
to
look
at
it
exclaiming
again
bella
lavvy
i
know
what
i
have
got
on
i
was
going
to
tell
ma
when
you
interrupted
i
have
left
mr
boffin
house
for
good
ma
and
i
have
come
home
again
mrs
wilfer
spake
no
word
but
having
glared
at
her
offspring
for
a
minute
or
two
in
an
awful
silence
retired
into
her
corner
of
state
backward
and
sat
down
like
a
frozen
article
on
sale
in
a
russian
market
short
dear
ma
said
bella
taking
off
the
depreciated
bonnet
and
shaking
out
her
hair
have
had
a
very
serious
difference
with
mr
boffin
on
the
subject
of
his
treatment
of
a
member
of
his
household
and
it
a
final
difference
and
there
an
end
of
all
i
am
bound
to
tell
you
my
dear
added
submissively
bella
has
acted
in
a
truly
brave
spirit
and
with
a
truly
right
feeling
and
therefore
i
hope
my
dear
you
not
allow
yourself
to
be
greatly
disappointed
said
miss
lavvy
in
a
sepulchral
warning
voice
founded
on
her
mother
sampson
speak
what
did
i
tell
you
about
those
boffins
mr
sampson
perceiving
his
frail
bark
to
be
labouring
among
shoals
and
breakers
thought
it
safest
not
to
refer
back
to
any
particular
thing
that
he
had
been
told
lest
he
should
refer
back
to
the
wrong
thing
with
admirable
seamanship
he
got
his
bark
into
deep
water
by
murmuring
indeed
i
told
george
sampson
as
george
sampson
tells
you
said
miss
lavvy
those
hateful
boffins
would
pick
a
quarrel
with
bella
as
soon
as
her
novelty
had
worn
off
have
they
done
it
or
have
they
not
was
i
right
or
was
i
wrong
and
what
do
you
say
to
us
bella
of
your
boffins
now
and
ma
said
bella
say
of
mr
and
mrs
boffin
what
i
always
have
said
and
i
always
shall
say
of
them
what
i
always
have
said
but
nothing
will
induce
me
to
quarrel
with
any
one
i
hope
you
are
not
sorry
to
see
me
ma
dear
kissing
her
i
hope
you
are
not
sorry
to
see
me
lavvy
kissing
her
too
as
i
notice
the
lettuce
ma
mentioned
on
the
table
i
make
the
salad
bella
playfully
setting
herself
about
the
task
mrs
wilfer
impressive
countenance
followed
her
with
glaring
eyes
presenting
a
combination
of
the
once
popular
sign
of
the
saracen
head
with
a
piece
of
dutch
and
suggesting
to
an
imaginative
mind
that
from
the
composition
of
the
salad
her
daughter
might
prudently
omit
the
vinegar
but
no
word
issued
from
the
majestic
matron
lips
and
this
was
more
terrific
to
her
husband
as
perhaps
she
knew
than
any
flow
of
eloquence
with
which
she
could
have
edified
the
company
ma
dear
said
bella
in
due
course
salad
ready
and
past
mrs
wilfer
rose
but
remained
speechless
said
miss
lavinia
in
her
voice
of
warning
chair
mr
sampson
flew
to
the
excellent
lady
back
and
followed
her
up
close
chair
in
hand
as
she
stalked
to
the
banquet
arrived
at
the
table
she
took
her
rigid
seat
after
favouring
mr
sampson
with
a
glare
for
himself
which
caused
the
young
gentleman
to
retire
to
his
place
in
much
confusion
the
cherub
not
presuming
to
address
so
tremendous
an
object
transacted
her
supper
through
the
agency
of
a
third
person
as
to
your
ma
bella
my
dear
and
i
dare
say
your
ma
would
take
some
lettuce
if
you
were
to
put
it
on
her
plate
mrs
wilfer
manner
of
receiving
those
viands
was
marked
by
petrified
absence
of
mind
in
which
state
likewise
she
partook
of
them
occasionally
laying
down
her
knife
and
fork
as
saying
within
her
own
spirit
is
this
i
am
doing
and
glaring
at
one
or
other
of
the
party
as
if
in
indignant
search
of
information
a
magnetic
result
of
such
glaring
was
that
the
person
glared
at
could
not
by
any
means
successfully
pretend
to
be
ignorant
of
the
fact
so
that
a
bystander
without
beholding
mrs
wilfer
at
all
must
have
known
at
whom
she
was
glaring
by
seeing
her
refracted
from
the
countenance
of
the
beglared
one
miss
lavinia
was
extremely
affable
to
mr
sampson
on
this
special
occasion
and
took
the
opportunity
of
informing
her
sister
why
was
not
worth
troubling
you
about
bella
when
you
were
in
a
sphere
so
far
removed
from
your
family
as
to
make
it
a
matter
in
which
you
could
be
expected
to
take
very
little
interest
said
lavinia
with
a
toss
of
her
chin
george
sampson
is
paying
his
addresses
to
me
bella
was
glad
to
hear
it
mr
sampson
became
thoughtfully
red
and
felt
called
upon
to
encircle
miss
lavinia
waist
with
his
arm
but
encountering
a
large
pin
in
the
young
lady
belt
scarified
a
finger
uttered
a
sharp
exclamation
and
attracted
the
lightning
of
mrs
glare
is
getting
on
very
well
said
miss
lavinia
which
might
not
have
been
supposed
at
the
moment
i
dare
say
we
shall
be
married
one
of
these
days
i
did
care
to
mention
it
when
you
were
with
your
bof
here
miss
lavinia
checked
herself
in
a
bounce
and
added
more
placidly
you
were
with
mr
and
mrs
boffin
but
now
i
think
it
sisterly
to
name
the
circumstance
you
lavvy
dear
i
congratulate
you
you
bella
the
truth
is
george
and
i
did
discuss
whether
i
should
tell
you
but
i
said
to
george
that
you
would
be
much
interested
in
so
paltry
an
affair
and
that
it
was
far
more
likely
you
would
rather
detach
yourself
from
us
altogether
than
have
him
added
to
the
rest
of
us
was
a
mistake
dear
lavvy
said
bella
turns
out
to
be
replied
miss
lavinia
circumstances
have
changed
you
know
my
dear
george
is
in
a
new
situation
and
his
prospects
are
very
good
indeed
i
should
have
had
the
courage
to
tell
you
so
yesterday
when
you
would
have
thought
his
prospects
poor
and
not
worth
notice
but
i
feel
quite
bold
tonight
did
you
begin
to
feel
timid
lavvy
inquired
bella
with
a
smile
did
say
that
i
ever
felt
timid
bella
replied
the
irrepressible
perhaps
i
might
have
said
if
i
had
not
been
restrained
by
delicacy
towards
a
sister
feelings
that
i
have
for
some
time
felt
independent
too
independent
my
dear
to
subject
myself
to
have
my
intended
match
you
prick
yourself
again
george
looked
down
upon
it
is
not
that
i
could
have
blamed
you
for
looking
down
upon
it
when
you
were
looking
up
to
a
rich
and
great
match
bella
it
is
only
that
i
was
independent
whether
the
irrepressible
felt
slighted
by
bella
declaration
that
she
would
not
quarrel
or
whether
her
spitefulness
was
evoked
by
return
to
the
sphere
of
mr
george
sampson
courtship
or
whether
it
was
a
necessary
fillip
to
her
spirits
that
she
should
come
into
collision
with
somebody
on
the
present
occasion
anyhow
she
made
a
dash
at
her
stately
parent
now
with
the
greatest
impetuosity
pray
do
sit
staring
at
me
in
that
intensely
aggravating
manner
if
you
see
a
black
on
my
nose
tell
me
so
if
you
do
leave
me
alone
you
address
me
in
those
words
said
mrs
wilfer
you
presume
talk
about
presuming
ma
for
goodness
sake
a
girl
who
is
old
enough
to
be
engaged
is
quite
old
enough
to
object
to
be
stared
at
as
if
she
was
a
clock
one
said
mrs
wilfer
grandmamma
if
so
addressed
by
one
of
her
daughters
at
any
age
would
have
insisted
on
her
retiring
to
a
dark
apartment
grandmamma
returned
lavvy
folding
her
arms
and
leaning
back
in
her
chair
have
sat
staring
people
out
of
countenance
i
think
would
said
mrs
wilfer
it
a
pity
she
did
know
better
said
lavvy
if
my
grandmamma
was
in
her
dotage
when
she
took
to
insisting
on
retiring
to
dark
apartments
she
ought
to
have
been
a
pretty
exhibition
my
grandmamma
must
have
made
of
herself
i
wonder
whether
she
ever
insisted
on
people
retiring
into
the
ball
of
st
paul
and
if
she
did
how
she
got
them
there
proclaimed
mrs
wilfer
command
silence
have
not
the
slightest
intention
of
being
silent
ma
returned
lavinia
coolly
quite
the
contrary
i
am
not
going
to
be
eyed
as
if
i
had
come
from
the
boffins
and
sit
silent
under
it
i
am
not
going
to
have
george
sampson
eyed
as
if
he
had
come
from
the
boffins
and
sit
silent
under
it
if
pa
thinks
proper
to
be
eyed
as
if
he
had
come
from
the
boffins
also
well
and
good
i
do
choose
to
and
i
wo
lavinia
engineering
having
made
this
crooked
opening
at
bella
mrs
wilfer
strode
into
it
rebellious
spirit
you
mutinous
child
tell
me
this
lavinia
if
in
violation
of
your
mother
sentiments
you
had
condescended
to
allow
yourself
to
be
patronized
by
the
boffins
and
if
you
had
come
from
those
halls
of
slavery
mere
nonsense
ma
said
lavinia
exclaimed
mrs
wilfer
with
sublime
severity
of
slavery
ma
is
mere
stuff
and
nonsense
returned
the
unmoved
irrepressible
say
presumptuous
child
if
you
had
come
from
the
neighbourhood
of
portland
place
bending
under
the
yoke
of
patronage
and
attended
by
its
domestics
in
glittering
garb
to
visit
me
do
you
think
my
feelings
could
have
been
expressed
in
looks
i
think
about
it
is
returned
lavinia
i
should
wish
them
expressed
to
the
right
person
if
pursued
her
mother
making
light
of
my
warnings
that
the
face
of
mrs
boffin
alone
was
a
face
teeming
with
evil
you
had
clung
to
mrs
boffin
instead
of
to
me
and
had
after
all
come
home
rejected
by
mrs
boffin
trampled
under
foot
by
mrs
boffin
and
cast
out
by
mrs
boffin
do
you
think
my
feelings
could
have
been
expressed
in
looks
lavinia
was
about
replying
to
her
honoured
parent
that
she
might
as
well
have
dispensed
with
her
looks
altogether
then
when
bella
rose
and
said
night
dear
ma
i
have
had
a
tiring
day
and
i
go
to
bed
this
broke
up
the
agreeable
party
mr
george
sampson
shortly
afterwards
took
his
leave
accompanied
by
miss
lavinia
with
a
candle
as
far
as
the
hall
and
without
a
candle
as
far
as
the
garden
gate
mrs
wilfer
washing
her
hands
of
the
boffins
went
to
bed
after
the
manner
of
lady
macbeth
and
was
left
alone
among
the
dilapidations
of
the
supper
table
in
a
melancholy
attitude
but
a
light
footstep
roused
him
from
his
meditations
and
it
was
bella
her
pretty
hair
was
hanging
all
about
her
and
she
had
tripped
down
softly
brush
in
hand
and
barefoot
to
say
to
him
dear
you
most
unquestionably
are
a
lovely
woman
said
the
cherub
taking
up
a
tress
in
his
hand
here
sir
said
bella
your
lovely
woman
marries
you
shall
have
that
piece
if
you
like
and
she
make
you
a
chain
of
it
would
you
prize
that
remembrance
of
the
dear
creature
my
precious
you
shall
have
it
if
you
good
sir
i
am
very
very
sorry
dearest
pa
to
have
brought
home
all
this
trouble
pet
returned
her
father
in
the
simplest
good
faith
make
yourself
uneasy
about
that
it
really
is
not
worth
mentioning
because
things
at
home
would
have
taken
pretty
much
the
same
turn
any
way
if
your
mother
and
sister
do
find
one
subject
to
get
at
times
a
little
wearing
on
they
find
another
we
never
out
of
a
wearing
subject
my
dear
i
assure
you
i
am
afraid
you
find
your
old
room
with
lavvy
dreadfully
inconvenient
bella
i
do
pa
i
do
mind
why
do
i
mind
do
you
think
pa
my
child
you
used
to
complain
of
it
when
it
was
such
a
contrast
as
it
must
be
now
upon
my
word
i
can
only
answer
because
you
are
so
much
improved
because
i
am
so
thankful
and
so
happy
here
she
choked
him
until
her
long
hair
made
him
sneeze
and
then
she
laughed
until
she
made
him
laugh
and
then
she
choked
him
again
that
they
might
not
be
overheard
sir
said
bella
lovely
woman
was
told
her
fortune
to
night
on
her
way
home
it
wo
be
a
large
fortune
because
if
the
lovely
woman
intended
gets
a
certain
appointment
that
he
hopes
to
get
soon
she
will
marry
on
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
but
that
at
first
and
even
if
it
should
never
be
more
the
lovely
woman
will
make
it
quite
enough
but
that
not
all
sir
in
the
fortune
there
a
certain
fair
man
a
little
man
the
said
who
it
seems
will
always
find
himself
near
the
lovely
woman
and
will
always
have
kept
expressly
for
him
such
a
peaceful
corner
in
the
lovely
little
house
as
never
was
tell
me
the
name
of
that
man
sir
he
a
knave
in
the
pack
of
cards
inquired
the
cherub
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
cried
bella
in
high
glee
choking
him
again
the
knave
of
wilfers
dear
pa
the
lovely
woman
means
to
look
forward
to
this
fortune
that
has
been
told
for
her
so
delightfully
and
to
cause
it
to
make
her
a
much
better
lovely
woman
than
she
ever
has
been
yet
what
the
little
fair
man
is
expected
to
do
sir
is
to
look
forward
to
it
also
by
saying
to
himself
when
he
is
in
danger
of
being
i
see
land
at
last
see
land
at
last
repeated
her
father
a
dear
knave
of
wilfers
exclaimed
bella
then
putting
out
her
small
white
bare
foot
the
mark
sir
come
to
the
mark
put
your
boot
against
it
we
keep
to
it
together
mind
now
sir
you
may
kiss
the
lovely
woman
before
she
runs
away
so
thankful
and
so
happy
o
yes
fair
little
man
so
thankful
and
so
happy
chapter
a
social
chorus
amazement
sits
enthroned
upon
the
countenances
of
mr
and
mrs
alfred
lammle
circle
of
acquaintance
when
the
disposal
of
their
furniture
and
effects
including
a
billiard
table
in
capital
letters
auction
under
a
bill
of
sale
is
publicly
announced
on
a
waving
hearthrug
in
sackville
street
but
nobody
is
half
so
much
amazed
as
hamilton
veneering
esquire
for
who
instantly
begins
to
find
out
that
the
lammles
are
the
only
people
ever
entered
on
his
soul
register
who
are
not
the
oldest
and
dearest
friends
he
has
in
the
world
mrs
veneering
for
like
a
faithful
wife
shares
her
husband
discovery
and
inexpressible
astonishment
perhaps
the
veneerings
twain
may
deem
the
last
unutterable
feeling
particularly
due
to
their
reputation
by
reason
that
once
upon
a
time
some
of
the
longer
heads
in
the
city
are
whispered
to
have
shaken
themselves
when
veneering
extensive
dealings
and
great
wealth
were
mentioned
but
it
is
certain
that
neither
mr
nor
mrs
veneering
can
find
words
to
wonder
in
and
it
becomes
necessary
that
they
give
to
the
oldest
and
dearest
friends
they
have
in
the
world
a
wondering
dinner
for
it
is
by
this
time
noticeable
that
whatever
befals
the
veneerings
must
give
a
dinner
upon
it
lady
tippins
lives
in
a
chronic
state
of
invitation
to
dine
with
the
veneerings
and
in
a
chronic
state
of
inflammation
arising
from
the
dinners
boots
and
brewer
go
about
in
cabs
with
no
other
intelligible
business
on
earth
than
to
beat
up
people
to
come
and
dine
with
the
veneerings
veneering
pervades
the
legislative
lobbies
intent
upon
entrapping
his
to
dinner
mrs
veneering
dined
with
faces
over
night
calls
upon
them
all
to
day
sends
them
every
one
a
for
the
week
after
next
before
that
dinner
is
digested
calls
upon
their
brothers
and
sisters
their
sons
and
daughters
their
nephews
and
nieces
their
aunts
and
uncles
and
cousins
and
invites
them
all
to
dinner
and
still
as
at
first
howsoever
the
dining
circle
widens
it
is
to
be
observed
that
all
the
diners
are
consistent
in
appearing
to
go
to
the
veneerings
not
to
dine
with
mr
and
mrs
veneering
which
would
seem
to
be
the
last
thing
in
their
minds
but
to
dine
with
one
another
perhaps
after
all
who
knows
veneering
may
find
this
dining
though
expensive
remunerative
in
the
sense
that
it
makes
champions
mr
podsnap
as
a
representative
man
is
not
alone
in
caring
very
particularly
for
his
own
dignity
if
not
for
that
of
his
acquaintances
and
therefore
in
angrily
supporting
the
acquaintances
who
have
taken
out
his
permit
lest
in
their
being
lessened
he
should
be
the
gold
and
silver
camels
and
the
and
the
rest
of
the
veneering
table
decorations
make
a
brilliant
show
and
when
i
podsnap
casually
remark
elsewhere
that
i
dined
last
monday
with
a
gorgeous
caravan
of
camels
i
find
it
personally
offensive
to
have
it
hinted
to
me
that
they
are
camels
or
camels
labouring
under
suspicion
of
any
sort
do
display
camels
myself
i
am
above
them
i
am
a
more
solid
man
but
these
camels
have
basked
in
the
light
of
my
countenance
and
how
dare
you
sir
insinuate
to
me
that
i
have
irradiated
any
but
unimpeachable
camels
the
camels
are
polishing
up
in
the
analytical
pantry
for
the
dinner
of
wonderment
on
the
occasion
of
the
lammles
going
to
pieces
and
mr
twemlow
feels
a
little
queer
on
the
sofa
at
his
lodgings
over
the
stable
yard
in
duke
street
saint
james
in
consequence
of
having
taken
two
advertised
pills
at
about
on
the
faith
of
the
printed
representation
accompanying
the
box
price
one
and
a
penny
halfpenny
government
stamp
included
that
the
same
be
found
highly
salutary
as
a
precautionary
measure
in
connection
with
the
pleasures
of
the
table
to
whom
while
sickly
with
the
fancy
of
an
insoluble
pill
sticking
in
his
gullet
and
also
with
the
sensation
of
a
deposit
of
warm
gum
languidly
wandering
within
him
a
little
lower
down
a
servant
enters
with
the
announcement
that
a
lady
wishes
to
speak
with
him
lady
says
twemlow
pluming
his
ruffled
feathers
the
favour
of
the
lady
name
the
lady
name
is
lammle
the
lady
will
not
detain
mr
twemlow
longer
than
a
very
few
minutes
the
lady
is
sure
that
mr
twemlow
will
do
her
the
kindness
to
see
her
on
being
told
that
she
particularly
desires
a
short
interview
the
lady
has
no
doubt
whatever
of
mr
compliance
when
he
hears
her
name
has
begged
the
servant
to
be
particular
not
to
mistake
her
name
would
have
sent
in
a
card
but
has
none
the
lady
in
lady
shown
in
comes
in
mr
twemlow
little
rooms
are
modestly
furnished
in
an
manner
rather
like
the
housekeeper
room
at
snigsworthy
park
and
would
be
bare
of
mere
ornament
were
it
not
for
a
engraving
of
the
sublime
snigsworth
over
the
chimneypiece
snorting
at
a
corinthian
column
with
an
enormous
roll
of
paper
at
his
feet
and
a
heavy
curtain
going
to
tumble
down
on
his
head
those
accessories
being
understood
to
represent
the
noble
lord
as
somehow
in
the
act
of
saving
his
country
take
a
seat
mrs
lammle
mrs
lammle
takes
a
seat
and
opens
the
conversation
have
no
doubt
mr
twemlow
that
you
have
heard
of
a
reverse
of
fortune
having
befallen
us
of
course
you
have
heard
of
it
for
no
kind
of
news
travels
so
fast
among
one
friends
especially
mindful
of
the
wondering
dinner
twemlow
with
a
little
twinge
admits
the
imputation
it
will
not
says
mrs
lammle
with
a
certain
hardened
manner
upon
her
that
makes
twemlow
shrink
surprised
you
so
much
as
some
others
after
what
passed
between
us
at
the
house
which
is
now
turned
out
at
windows
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
calling
upon
you
mr
twemlow
to
add
a
sort
of
postscript
to
what
i
said
that
day
mr
twemlow
dry
and
hollow
cheeks
become
more
dry
and
hollow
at
the
prospect
of
some
new
complication
says
the
uneasy
little
gentleman
mrs
lammle
i
should
take
it
as
a
favour
if
you
could
excuse
me
from
any
further
confidence
it
has
ever
been
one
of
the
objects
of
my
life
which
unfortunately
has
not
had
many
objects
to
be
inoffensive
and
to
keep
out
of
cabals
and
interferences
mrs
lammle
by
far
the
more
observant
of
the
two
scarcely
finds
it
necessary
to
look
at
twemlow
while
he
speaks
so
easily
does
she
read
him
postscript
to
retain
the
term
i
have
used
says
mrs
lammle
fixing
her
eyes
on
his
face
to
enforce
what
she
says
herself
exactly
with
what
you
say
mr
twemlow
so
far
from
troubling
you
with
any
new
confidence
i
merely
wish
to
remind
you
what
the
old
one
was
so
far
from
asking
you
for
interference
i
merely
wish
to
claim
your
strict
neutrality
twemlow
going
on
to
reply
she
rests
her
eyes
again
knowing
her
ears
to
be
quite
enough
for
the
contents
of
so
weak
a
vessel
can
i
suppose
says
twemlow
nervously
no
reasonable
objection
to
hearing
anything
that
you
do
me
the
honour
to
wish
to
say
to
me
under
those
heads
but
if
i
may
with
all
possible
delicacy
and
politeness
entreat
you
not
to
range
beyond
them
i
i
beg
to
do
so
says
mrs
lammle
raising
her
eyes
to
his
face
again
and
quite
daunting
him
with
her
hardened
manner
imparted
to
you
a
certain
piece
of
knowledge
to
be
imparted
again
as
you
thought
best
to
a
certain
person
i
did
says
twemlow
for
doing
which
i
thank
you
though
indeed
i
scarcely
know
why
i
turned
traitress
to
my
husband
in
the
matter
for
the
girl
is
a
poor
little
fool
i
was
a
poor
little
fool
once
myself
i
can
find
no
better
reason
seeing
the
effect
she
produces
on
him
by
her
indifferent
laugh
and
cold
look
she
keeps
her
eyes
upon
him
as
she
proceeds
twemlow
if
you
should
chance
to
see
my
husband
or
to
see
me
or
to
see
both
of
us
in
the
favour
or
confidence
of
any
one
else
whether
of
our
common
acquaintance
or
not
is
of
no
consequence
you
have
no
right
to
use
against
us
the
knowledge
i
intrusted
you
with
for
one
special
purpose
which
has
been
accomplished
this
is
what
i
came
to
say
it
is
not
a
stipulation
to
a
gentleman
it
is
simply
a
reminder
twemlow
sits
murmuring
to
himself
with
his
hand
to
his
forehead
is
so
plain
a
case
mrs
lammle
goes
on
between
me
from
the
first
relying
on
your
honour
and
you
that
i
will
not
waste
another
word
upon
it
she
looks
steadily
at
mr
twemlow
until
with
a
shrug
he
makes
her
a
little
bow
as
though
saying
i
think
you
have
a
right
to
rely
upon
me
and
then
she
moistens
her
lips
and
shows
a
sense
of
relief
trust
i
have
kept
the
promise
i
made
through
your
servant
that
i
would
detain
you
a
very
few
minutes
i
need
trouble
you
no
longer
mr
twemlow
says
twemlow
rising
as
she
rises
me
a
moment
i
should
never
have
sought
you
out
madam
to
say
what
i
am
going
to
say
but
since
you
have
sought
me
out
and
are
here
i
will
throw
it
off
my
mind
was
it
quite
consistent
in
candour
with
our
taking
that
resolution
against
mr
fledgeby
that
you
should
afterwards
address
mr
fledgeby
as
your
dear
and
confidential
friend
and
entreat
a
favour
of
mr
fledgeby
always
supposing
that
you
did
i
assert
no
knowledge
of
my
own
on
the
subject
it
has
been
represented
to
me
that
you
did
he
told
you
retorts
mrs
lammle
who
again
has
saved
her
eyes
while
listening
and
uses
them
with
strong
effect
while
speaking
is
strange
that
he
should
have
told
you
the
truth
says
mrs
lammle
seriously
pondering
where
did
a
circumstance
so
very
extraordinary
happen
twemlow
hesitates
he
is
shorter
than
the
lady
as
well
as
weaker
and
as
she
stands
above
him
with
her
hardened
manner
and
her
eyes
he
finds
himself
at
such
a
disadvantage
that
he
would
like
to
be
of
the
opposite
sex
i
ask
where
it
happened
mr
twemlow
in
strict
confidence
must
confess
says
the
mild
little
gentleman
coming
to
his
answer
by
degrees
i
felt
some
compunctions
when
mr
fledgeby
mentioned
it
i
must
admit
that
i
could
not
regard
myself
in
an
agreeable
light
more
particularly
as
mr
fledgeby
did
with
great
civility
which
i
could
not
feel
that
i
deserved
from
him
render
me
the
same
service
that
you
had
entreated
him
to
render
you
it
is
a
part
of
the
true
nobility
of
the
poor
gentleman
soul
to
say
this
last
sentence
he
has
reflected
shall
assume
the
superior
position
of
having
no
difficulties
of
my
own
while
i
know
of
hers
which
would
be
mean
very
mean
mr
fledgeby
advocacy
as
effectual
in
your
case
as
in
ours
mrs
lammle
demands
ineffectual
you
make
up
your
mind
to
tell
me
where
you
saw
mr
fledgeby
mr
twemlow
beg
your
pardon
i
fully
intended
to
have
done
so
the
reservation
was
not
intentional
i
encountered
mr
fledgeby
quite
by
accident
on
the
by
the
expression
on
the
spot
i
mean
at
mr
riah
in
saint
mary
axe
you
the
misfortune
to
be
in
mr
riah
hands
then
madam
returns
twemlow
one
money
obligation
to
which
i
stand
committed
the
one
debt
of
my
life
but
it
is
a
just
debt
pray
observe
that
i
do
dispute
it
has
fallen
into
mr
riah
hands
twemlow
says
mrs
lammle
fixing
his
eyes
with
hers
which
he
would
prevent
her
doing
if
he
could
but
he
ca
has
fallen
into
mr
fledgeby
hands
mr
riah
is
his
mask
it
has
fallen
into
mr
hands
let
me
tell
you
that
for
your
guidance
the
information
may
be
of
use
to
you
if
only
to
prevent
your
credulity
in
judging
another
man
truthfulness
by
your
own
from
being
imposed
upon
cries
twemlow
standing
aghast
do
you
know
it
scarcely
know
how
i
know
it
the
whole
train
of
circumstances
seemed
to
take
fire
at
once
and
show
it
to
me
then
you
have
no
proof
is
very
strange
says
mrs
lammle
coldly
and
boldly
and
with
some
disdain
like
men
are
to
one
another
in
some
things
though
their
characters
are
as
different
as
can
be
no
two
men
can
have
less
affinity
between
them
one
would
say
than
mr
twemlow
and
my
husband
yet
my
husband
replies
to
me
you
have
no
proof
and
mr
twemlow
replies
to
me
with
the
very
same
words
why
madam
twemlow
ventures
gently
to
argue
why
the
very
same
words
because
they
state
the
fact
because
you
have
no
proof
are
very
wise
in
their
way
quoth
mrs
lammle
glancing
haughtily
at
the
snigsworth
portrait
and
shaking
out
her
dress
before
departing
they
have
wisdom
to
learn
my
husband
who
is
not
ingenuous
or
inexperienced
sees
this
plain
thing
no
more
than
mr
twemlow
does
because
there
is
no
proof
yet
i
believe
five
women
out
of
six
in
my
place
would
see
it
as
clearly
as
i
do
however
i
will
never
rest
if
only
in
remembrance
of
mr
fledgeby
having
kissed
my
hand
until
my
husband
does
see
it
and
you
will
do
well
for
yourself
to
see
it
from
this
time
forth
mr
twemlow
though
i
can
give
you
no
proof
as
she
moves
towards
the
door
mr
twemlow
attending
on
her
expresses
his
soothing
hope
that
the
condition
of
mr
lammle
affairs
is
not
irretrievable
do
know
mrs
lammle
answers
stopping
and
sketching
out
the
pattern
of
the
paper
on
the
wall
with
the
point
of
her
parasol
depends
there
may
be
an
opening
for
him
dawning
now
or
there
may
be
none
we
shall
soon
find
out
if
none
we
are
bankrupt
here
and
must
go
abroad
i
suppose
mr
twemlow
in
his
desire
to
make
the
best
of
it
remarks
that
there
are
pleasant
lives
abroad
returns
mrs
lammle
still
sketching
on
the
wall
i
doubt
whether
and
so
forth
for
the
means
to
live
under
suspicion
at
a
dirty
is
one
of
them
it
is
much
for
mr
lammle
twemlow
politely
intimates
though
greatly
shocked
to
have
one
always
beside
him
who
is
attached
to
him
in
all
his
fortunes
and
whose
restraining
influence
will
prevent
him
from
courses
that
would
be
discreditable
and
ruinous
as
he
says
it
mrs
lammle
leaves
off
sketching
and
looks
at
him
influence
mr
twemlow
we
must
eat
and
drink
and
dress
and
have
a
roof
over
our
heads
always
beside
him
and
attached
in
all
his
fortunes
not
much
to
boast
of
in
that
what
can
a
woman
at
my
age
do
my
husband
and
i
deceived
one
another
when
we
married
we
must
bear
the
consequences
of
the
deception
that
is
to
say
bear
one
another
and
bear
the
burden
of
scheming
together
for
dinner
and
breakfast
till
death
divorces
us
with
those
words
she
walks
out
into
duke
street
saint
james
mr
twemlow
returning
to
his
sofa
lays
down
his
aching
head
on
its
slippery
little
horsehair
bolster
with
a
strong
internal
conviction
that
a
painful
interview
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
to
be
taken
after
the
dinner
pills
which
are
so
highly
salutary
in
connexion
with
the
pleasures
of
the
table
but
six
in
the
evening
finds
the
worthy
little
gentleman
getting
better
and
also
getting
himself
into
his
obsolete
little
silk
stockings
and
pumps
for
the
wondering
dinner
at
the
veneerings
and
seven
in
the
evening
finds
him
trotting
out
into
duke
street
to
trot
to
the
corner
and
save
a
sixpence
in
tippins
the
divine
has
dined
herself
into
such
a
condition
by
this
time
that
a
morbid
mind
might
desire
her
for
a
blessed
change
to
sup
at
last
and
turn
into
bed
such
a
mind
has
mr
eugene
wrayburn
whom
twemlow
finds
contemplating
tippins
with
the
moodiest
of
visages
while
that
playful
creature
rallies
him
on
being
so
long
overdue
at
the
woolsack
skittish
is
tippins
with
mortimer
lightwood
too
and
has
raps
to
give
him
with
her
fan
for
having
been
best
man
at
the
nuptials
of
these
deceiving
who
have
gone
to
pieces
though
indeed
the
fan
is
generally
lively
and
taps
away
at
the
men
in
all
directions
with
something
of
a
grisly
sound
suggestive
of
the
clattering
of
lady
tippins
bones
a
new
race
of
intimate
friends
has
sprung
up
at
veneering
since
he
went
into
parliament
for
the
public
good
to
whom
mrs
veneering
is
very
attentive
these
friends
like
astronomical
distances
are
only
to
be
spoken
of
in
the
very
largest
figures
boots
says
that
one
of
them
is
a
contractor
who
it
has
been
calculated
gives
employment
directly
and
indirectly
to
five
hundred
thousand
men
brewer
says
that
another
of
them
is
a
chairman
in
such
request
at
so
many
boards
so
far
apart
that
he
never
travels
less
by
railway
than
three
thousand
miles
a
week
buffer
says
that
another
of
them
had
a
sixpence
eighteen
months
ago
and
through
the
brilliancy
of
his
genius
in
getting
those
shares
issued
at
and
buying
them
all
up
with
no
money
and
selling
them
at
par
for
cash
has
now
three
hundred
and
thousand
pounds
buffer
particularly
insisting
on
the
odd
and
declining
to
take
a
farthing
less
with
buffer
boots
and
brewer
lady
tippins
is
eminently
facetious
on
the
subject
of
these
fathers
of
the
surveying
them
through
her
eyeglass
and
inquiring
whether
boots
and
brewer
and
buffer
think
they
will
make
her
fortune
if
she
makes
love
to
them
with
other
pleasantries
of
that
nature
veneering
in
his
different
way
is
much
occupied
with
the
fathers
too
piously
retiring
with
them
into
the
conservatory
from
which
retreat
the
word
is
occasionally
heard
and
where
the
fathers
instruct
veneering
how
he
must
leave
the
valley
of
the
piano
on
his
left
take
the
level
of
the
mantelpiece
cross
by
an
open
cutting

the

up
the
opposition

and
branch
at
the
window
curtains
mr
and
mrs
podsnap
are
of
the
company
and
the
fathers
descry
in
mrs
podsnap
a
fine
woman
she
is
consigned
to
a
father
boots
father
who
employs
five
hundred
thousand
men
and
is
brought
to
anchor
on
veneering
left
thus
affording
opportunity
to
the
sportive
tippins
on
his
right
he
as
usual
being
mere
vacant
space
to
entreat
to
be
told
something
about
those
loves
of
navvies
and
whether
they
really
do
live
on
raw
beefsteaks
and
drink
porter
out
of
their
barrows
but
in
spite
of
such
little
skirmishes
it
is
felt
that
this
was
to
be
a
wondering
dinner
and
that
the
wondering
must
not
be
neglected
accordingly
brewer
as
the
man
who
has
the
greatest
reputation
to
sustain
becomes
the
interpreter
of
the
general
instinct
took
says
brewer
in
a
favourable
pause
cab
this
morning
and
i
rattled
off
to
that
sale
boots
devoured
by
envy
says
did
i
buffer
says
did
i
but
can
find
nobody
to
care
whether
he
did
or
not
what
was
it
like
inquires
veneering
assure
you
replies
brewer
looking
about
for
anybody
else
to
address
his
answer
to
and
giving
the
preference
to
lightwood
assure
you
the
things
were
going
for
a
song
handsome
things
enough
but
fetching
nothing
i
heard
this
afternoon
says
lightwood
brewer
begs
to
know
now
would
it
be
fair
to
ask
a
professional
man
how
on
earth
these
people
ever
did
come
to
such
a
total
smash
brewer
divisions
being
for
emphasis
lightwood
replies
that
he
was
consulted
certainly
but
could
give
no
opinion
which
would
pay
off
the
bill
of
sale
and
therefore
violates
no
confidence
in
supposing
that
it
came
of
their
living
beyond
their
means
how
says
veneering
people
do
that
hah
that
is
felt
on
all
hands
to
be
a
shot
in
the
bull
eye
how
can
people
do
that
the
analytical
chemist
going
round
with
champagne
looks
very
much
as
if
he
could
give
them
a
pretty
good
idea
how
people
did
that
if
he
had
a
mind
says
mrs
veneering
laying
down
her
fork
to
press
her
aquiline
hands
together
at
the
tips
of
the
fingers
and
addressing
the
father
who
travels
the
three
thousand
miles
per
week
a
mother
can
look
at
her
baby
and
know
that
she
lives
beyond
her
husband
means
i
can
not
imagine
eugene
suggests
that
mrs
lammle
not
being
a
mother
had
no
baby
to
look
at
says
mrs
veneering
the
principle
is
the
same
boots
is
clear
that
the
principle
is
the
same
so
is
buffer
it
is
the
unfortunate
destiny
of
buffer
to
damage
a
cause
by
espousing
it
the
rest
of
the
company
have
meekly
yielded
to
the
proposition
that
the
principle
is
the
same
until
buffer
says
it
is
when
instantly
a
general
murmur
arises
that
the
principle
is
not
the
same
i
do
understand
says
the
father
of
the
three
hundred
and
thousand
pounds
if
these
people
spoken
of
occupied
the
position
of
being
in
society
they
were
in
society
veneering
is
bound
to
confess
that
they
dined
here
and
were
even
married
from
here
i
do
understand
pursues
the
father
even
their
living
beyond
their
means
could
bring
them
to
what
has
been
termed
a
total
smash
because
there
is
always
such
a
thing
as
an
adjustment
of
affairs
in
the
case
of
people
of
any
standing
at
all
eugene
who
would
seem
to
be
in
a
gloomy
state
of
suggestiveness
suggests
you
have
no
means
and
live
beyond
them
this
is
too
insolvent
a
state
of
things
for
the
father
to
entertain
it
is
too
insolvent
a
state
of
things
for
any
one
with
any
to
entertain
and
is
universally
scouted
but
it
is
so
amazing
how
any
people
can
have
come
to
a
total
smash
that
everybody
feels
bound
to
account
for
it
specially
one
of
the
fathers
says
table
another
of
the
fathers

without
knowing
that
speculation
is
a
science

his

inconveniently
unexplainable

in

chair
is
observing
mr

with
an
irreverent
face
and
may
be
about
to
offer
a
new
suggestion
when
the
analytical
is
beheld
in
collision
with
the
coachman
the
coachman
manifesting
a
purpose
of
coming
at
the
company
with
a
silver
salver
as
though
intent
upon
making
a
collection
for
his
wife
and
family
the
analytical
cutting
him
off
at
the
sideboard
the
superior
stateliness
if
not
the
superior
generalship
of
the
analytical
prevails
over
a
man
who
is
as
nothing
off
the
box
and
the
coachman
yielding
up
his
salver
retires
defeated

the
analytical
perusing
a
scrap
of
paper
lying
on
the
salver
with
the
air
of

censor
adjusts
it
takes
his
time
about
going
to
the

with

and
presents
it
to
mr
eugene
wrayburn
whereupon
the
pleasant
tippins
says
aloud

distracting
coolness
and
slowness

the
curiosity
of

a
pretence
of
getting
out

with
difficulty
long
after

and
pretty
on
an
evening
in
the
summer
time
a
soft
air
stirred
the
leaves
of
the
fresh
green
trees
and
passed
like
a
smooth
shadow
over
the
river
and
like
a
smoother
shadow
over
the
yielding
grass
the
voice
of
the
falling
water
like
the
voices
of
the
sea
and
the
wind
were
as
an
outer
memory
to
a
contemplative
listener
but
not
particularly
so
to
mr
riderhood
who
sat
on
one
of
the
blunt
wooden
levers
of
his
dozing
wine
must
be
got
into
a
butt
by
some
agency
before
it
can
be
drawn
out
and
the
wine
of
sentiment
never
having
been
got
into
mr
riderhood
by
any
agency
nothing
in
nature
tapped
him
as
the
rogue
sat
ever
and
again
nodding
himself
off
his
balance
his
recovery
was
always
attended
by
an
angry
stare
and
growl
as
if
in
the
absence
of
any
one
else
he
had
aggressive
inclinations
towards
himself
in
one
of
these
starts
the
cry
of
ho
lock
prevented
his
relapse
into
a
doze
shaking
himself
as
he
got
up
like
the
surly
brute
he
was
he
gave
his
growl
a
responsive
twist
at
the
end
and
turned
his
face
to
see
who
hailed
it

an
well
up
to
his
work
though
taking
it
easily
in
so
light
a
boat
that
the
rogue
remarked
little
less
on
you
and
you
ha
been
a
wagerbut
then
went
to
work
at
his
windlass
handles
and
sluices
to
let
the
sculler
in
as
the
latter
stood
in
his
boat
holding
on
by
the
to
the
woodwork
at
the
lock
side
waiting
for
the

riderhood
recognized
his
governor
mr
eugene
wrayburn
who
was
however
too
indifferent
or
too
much
engaged
to
recognize
him
the
creaking
opened
slowly
and
the
light
boat
passed
in
as
soon
as
there
was
room
enough
and
the
creaking
closed
upon
it
and
it
floated
low
down
in
the
dock
between
the
two
sets
of
gates
until
the
water
should
rise
and
the
second
gates
should
open
and
let
it
out
when
riderhood
had
run
to
his
second
windlass
and
turned
it
and
while
he
leaned
against
the
lever
of
that
gate
to
help
it
to
swing
open
presently
he
noticed
lying
to
rest
under
the
green
hedge
by
the
astern
of
the
lock
a
bargeman
the
water
rose
and
rose
as
the
sluice
poured
in
dispersing
the
scum
which
had
formed
behind
the
lumbering
gates
and
sending
the
boat
up
so
that
the
sculler
gradually
rose
like
an
apparition
against
the
light
from
the
bargeman
point
of
view
riderhood
observed
that
the
bargeman
rose
too
leaning
on
his
arm
and
seemed
to
have
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
rising
figure
but
there
was
the
toll
to
be
taken
as
the
gates
were
now
complaining
and
opening
the
governor
tossed
it
ashore
twisted
in
a
piece
of
paper
and
as
he
did
so
knew
his
man
ay
it
you
is
it
honest
friend
said
eugene
seating
himself
preparatory
to
resuming
his
sculls
got
the
place
then
got
the
place
and
no
thanks
to
you
for
it
nor
yet
none
to
lawyer
lightwood
gruffly
answered
riderhood
saved
our
recommendation
honest
fellow
said
eugene
the
next
candidate
the
one
who
will
offer
himself
when
you
are
transported
or
hanged
do
be
long
about
it
will
you
be
so
good
so
imperturbable
was
the
air
with
which
he
gravely
bent
to
his
work
that
riderhood
remained
staring
at
him
without
having
found
a
retort
until
he
had
rowed
past
a
line
of
wooden
objects
by
the
weir
which
showed
like
huge
teetotums
standing
at
rest
in
the
water
and
was
almost
hidden
by
the
drooping
boughs
on
the
left
bank
as
he
rowed
away
keeping
out
of
the
opposing
current
it
being
then
too
late
to
retort
with
any
effect
if
that
could
ever
have
been
done
the
honest
man
confined
himself
to
cursing
and
growling
in
a
grim
having
then
got
his
gates
shut
he
crossed
back
by
his
plank
to
the
side
of
the
river
if
in
so
doing
he
took
another
glance
at
the
bargeman
he
did
it
by
stealth
he
cast
himself
on
the
grass
by
the
lock
side
in
an
indolent
way
with
his
back
in
that
direction
and
having
gathered
a
few
blades
fell
to
chewing
them
the
dip
of
eugene
wrayburn
sculls
had
become
hardly
audible
in
his
ears
when
the
bargeman
passed
him
putting
the
utmost
width
that
he
could
between
them
and
keeping
under
the
hedge
then
riderhood
sat
up
and
took
a
long
look
at
his
figure
and
then
cried
i
i
lock
ho

the
bargeman
stopped
and
looked
back

gov

cried
mr
riderhood
with
his
hands
to
his
mouth
the
bargeman
turned
back
approaching
nearer
and
nearer
the
bargeman
became
bradley
headstone
in
rough
clothing
i
may
die
said
riderhood
smiting
his
right
leg
and
laughing
as
he
sat
on
the
grass
you
ai
ha
been
a
imitating
me
governor
never
thought
myself
so
afore
truly
bradley
headstone
had
taken
careful
note
of
the
honest
dress
in
the
course
of
that
they
had
had
together
he
must
have
committed
it
to
memory
and
slowly
got
it
by
heart
it
was
exactly
reproduced
in
the
dress
he
now
wore
and
whereas
in
his
own
schoolmaster
clothes
he
usually
looked
as
if
they
were
the
clothes
of
some
other
man
he
now
looked
in
the
clothes
of
some
other
man
or
men

they
were

own

bradley

his
pointing
finger
in
the
direction
the
boat
had
taken
a
flush
of
impatience
mounted
into
bradley
face
and
he
looked
anxiously
up
the
river
ai
locks
as
you
been
a
reckoning
up
said
riderhood
when
the
schoolmaster
eyes
came
back
again
no
other
calculations
do
you
suppose
i
have
been
occupied
with
mathematics
never
heerd
it
called
that
it
a
long
word
for
it
you
call
it
so
said
riderhood
stubbornly
chewing
his
grass
what
say
them
instead
of
it
if
you
like
was
the
coolly
growled
reply
safer
talk
too
do
you
mean
that
i
should
understand
by
them
affronts
offences
giv
and
took
deadly
aggrawations
such
like
answered
riderhood
do
what
bradley
headstone
would
he
could
not
keep
that
former
flush
of
impatience
out
of
his
face
or
so
master
his
eyes
as
to
prevent
their
again
looking
anxiously
up
the
river
ha
do
be
afeerd
said
riderhood
got
to
make
way
agin
the
stream
and
he
takes
it
easy
you
can
soon
come
up
with
him
but
wot
the
good
of
saying
that
to
you
you
know
how
fur
you
could
have
outwalked
him
betwixt
anywheres
about
where
he
lost
the
tide
say
richmond
and
this
if
you
had
a
mind
to
it
think
i
have
been
following
him
said
bradley
know
you
have
said
riderhood
i
have
i
have
bradley
admitted
with
another
anxious
look
up
the
river
may
land
you
he
wo
be
lost
if
he
does
land
said
riderhood
must
leave
his
boat
behind
him
he
ca
make
a
bundle
or
a
parcel
on
it
and
carry
it
ashore
with
him
under
his
arm
was
speaking
to
you
just
now
said
bradley
kneeling
on
one
knee
on
the
grass
beside
the
did
he
say
said
riderhood
repeated
riderhood
with
an
angry
oath
is
what
he
said
he
ca
say
nothing
but
cheek
i
ha
liked
to
plump
down
aboard
of
him
neck
and
crop
with
a
heavy
jump
and
sunk
him
bradley
turned
away
his
haggard
face
for
a
few
moments
and
then
said
tearing
up
a
tuft
of
grass
him
cried
riderhood
you
credit
hooroar
i
cry
chorus
to
the
turn
said
bradley
with
an
effort
at
that
forced
him
to
wipe
his
face
his
insolence
take
took
the
turn
answered
riderhood
with
sullen
ferocity
hoping
as
i
was
getting
ready
to
be
hanged
him
look
to
that
cried
bradley
him
look
to
that
it
will
be
bad
for
him
when
men
he
has
injured
and
at
whom
he
has
jeered
are
thinking
of
getting
hanged
let
him
get
ready
for
his
fate
when
that
comes
about
there
was
more
meaning
in
what
he
said
than
he
knew
of
or
he
would
have
had
brains
enough
to
say
it
let
him
look
to
it
let
him
look
to
it
when
men
he
has
wronged
and
on
whom
he
has
bestowed
his
insolence
are
getting
ready
to
be
hanged
there
is
a
ringing
and
not
for
them
riderhood
looking
fixedly
at
him
gradually
arose
from
his
recumbent
posture
while
the
schoolmaster
said
these
words
with
the
utmost
concentration
of
rage
and
hatred
so
when
the
words
were
all
spoken
he
too
kneeled
on
one
knee
on
the
grass
and
the
two
men
looked
at
one
another
said
riderhood
very
deliberately
spitting
out
the
grass
he
had
been
chewing
i
make
out
as
he
is
to
her
left
london
answered
bradley
i
have
hardly
a
doubt
this
time
that
at
last
he
is
going
to
her
ai
sure
then
am
as
sure
here
said
bradley
with
a
clutch
at
the
breast
of
his
coarse
shirt
if
it
was
written
there
with
a
blow
or
a
stab
at
the
sky
but
judging
from
the
looks
on
you
retorted
riderhood
completely
ridding
himself
of
his
grass
and
drawing
his
sleeve
across
his
mouth
made
ekally
sure
afore
and
have
got
disapinted
it
has
told
upon
you
said
bradley
in
a
low
voice
bending
forward
to
lay
his
hand
upon
the
shoulder
are
my
holidays
they
by
george
muttered
riderhood
with
his
eyes
on
the
face
working
days
must
be
stiff
if
these
is
your
holidays
i
have
never
left
him
pursued
bradley
waving
the
interruption
aside
with
an
impatient
hand
they
began
and
i
never
will
leave
him
now
till
i
have
seen
him
with
her
when
you
have
seen
him
with
her
said
i
come
back
to
you
riderhood
stiffened
the
knee
on
which
he
had
been
resting
got
up
and
looked
gloomily
at
his
new
friend
after
a
few
moments
they
walked
side
by
side
in
the
direction
the
boat
had
taken
as
if
by
tacit
consent
bradley
pressing
forward
and
riderhood
holding
back
bradley
getting
out
his
neat
prim
purse
into
his
hand
a
present
made
him
by
penny
subscription
among
his
pupils
and
riderhood
unfolding
his
arms
to
smear
his
across
his
mouth
with
a
thoughtful
air
have
a
pound
for
you
said
bradley
two
said
riderhood
bradley
held
a
sovereign
between
his
fingers
slouching
at
his
side
with
his
eyes
upon
the
riderhood
held
his
left
hand
open
with
a
certain
slight
drawing
action
towards
himself
bradley
dipped
in
his
purse
for
another
sovereign
and
two
chinked
in
riderhood
hand
the
drawing
action
of
which
promptly
strengthening
drew
them
home
to
his
pocket
i
must
follow
him
said
bradley
headstone
takes
this
the
fool
to
confuse
observation
or
divert
attention
if
not
solely
to
baffle
me
but
he
must
have
the
power
of
making
himself
invisible
before
he
can
shake
me
off
riderhood
stopped
you
do
get
disapinted
agin
maybe
you
put
up
at
the
when
you
come
back
will
riderhood
nodded
and
the
figure
of
the
bargeman
went
its
way
along
the
soft
turf
by
the
side
of
the
keeping
near
the
hedge
and
moving
quickly
they
had
turned
a
point
from
which
a
long
stretch
of
river
was
visible
a
stranger
to
the
scene
might
have
been
certain
that
here
and
there
along
the
line
of
hedge
a
figure
stood
watching
the
bargeman
and
waiting
for
him
to
come
up
so
he
himself
had
often
believed
at
first
until
his
eyes
became
used
to
the
posts
bearing
the
dagger
that
slew
wat
tyler
in
the
city
of
london
shield
within
mr
riderhood
knowledge
all
daggers
were
as
one
even
to
bradley
headstone
who
could
have
told
to
the
letter
without
book
all
about
wat
tyler
lord
mayor
walworth
and
the
king
that
it
is
dutiful
for
youth
to
know
there
was
but
one
subject
living
in
the
world
for
every
sharp
destructive
instrument
that
summer
evening
so
riderhood
looking
after
him
as
he
went
and
he
with
his
furtive
hand
laid
upon
the
dagger
as
he
passed
it
and
his
eyes
upon
the
boat
were
much
upon
a
par
the
boat
went
on
under
the
arching
trees
and
over
their
tranquil
shadows
in
the
water
the
bargeman
skulking
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
stream
went
on
after
it
sparkles
of
light
showed
riderhood
when
and
where
the
rower
dipped
his
blades
until
even
as
he
stood
idly
watching
the
sun
went
down
and
the
landscape
was
dyed
red
and
then
the
red
had
the
appearance
of
fading
out
of
it
and
mounting
up
to
heaven
as
we
say
that
blood
guiltily
shed
does
turning
back
towards
his
lock
he
had
not
gone
out
of
view
of
it
the
rogue
pondered
as
deeply
as
it
was
within
the
contracted
power
of
such
a
fellow
to
do
did
he
copy
my
clothes
he
could
have
looked
like
what
he
wanted
to
look
like
without
that
this
was
the
in
his
thoughts
in
which
too
there
came
lumbering
up
by
times
like
any
half
floating
and
half
sinking
rubbish
in
the
river
the
question
was
it
done
by
accident
the
setting
of
a
trap
for
finding
out
whether
it
was
accidentally
done
soon
superseded
as
a
practical
piece
of
cunning
the
abstruser
inquiry
why
otherwise
it
was
done
and
he
devised
a
means
rogue
riderhood
went
into
his
and
brought
forth
into
the
now
sober
grey
light
his
chest
of
clothes
sitting
on
the
grass
beside
it
he
turned
out
one
by
one
the
articles
it
contained
until
he
came
to
a
conspicuous
bright
red
neckerchief
stained
black
here
and
there
by
wear
it
arrested
his
attention
and
he
sat
pausing
over
it
until
he
took
off
the
rusty
colourless
wisp
that
he
wore
round
his
throat
and
substituted
the
red
neckerchief
leaving
the
long
ends
flowing
said
the
rogue
arter
he
sees
me
in
this
neckhankecher
i
see
him
in
a
neckhankecher
it
wo
be
accident
elated
by
his
device
he
carried
his
chest
in
again
and
went
to
supper
ho
lock
it
was
a
light
night
and
a
barge
coming
down
summoned
him
out
of
a
long
doze
in
due
course
he
had
let
the
barge
through
and
was
alone
again
looking
to
the
closing
of
his
gates
when
bradley
headstone
appeared
before
him
standing
on
the
brink
of
the
lock
said
riderhood
a
ready
has
put
up
for
the
night
at
an
angler
inn
was
the
fatigued
and
hoarse
reply
goes
on
up
the
river
at
six
in
the
morning
i
have
come
back
for
a
couple
of
hours
rest
want
said
riderhood
making
towards
the
schoolmaster
by
his
plank
bridge
do
want
them
returned
bradley
irritably
i
would
rather
not
have
them
but
would
much
prefer
to
follow
him
all
night
however
if
he
wo
lead
i
ca
follow
i
have
been
waiting
about
until
i
could
discover
for
a
certainty
at
what
time
he
starts
if
i
could
have
made
sure
of
it
i
should
have
stayed
this
would
be
a
bad
pit
for
a
man
to
be
flung
into
with
his
hands
tied
these
slippery
smooth
walls
would
give
him
no
chance
and
i
suppose
those
gates
would
suck
him
down
him
down
or
swaller
him
up
he
would
get
out
said
riderhood
even
if
his
hands
war
tied
he
would
shut
him
in
at
both
ends
and
i
give
him
a
pint
o
old
ale
ever
to
come
up
to
me
standing
here
bradley
looked
down
with
a
ghastly
relish
run
about
the
brink
and
run
across
it
in
this
uncertain
light
on
a
few
inches
width
of
rotten
wood
said
he
wonder
you
have
no
thought
of
being
drowned
ca
be
said
riderhood
ca
be
drowned
said
riderhood
shaking
his
head
with
an
air
of
thorough
conviction
well
known
i
been
brought
out
o
drowning
and
i
ca
be
drowned
i
would
have
that
there
busted
aware
on
it
or
her
people
might
make
it
tell
agin
the
damages
i
mean
to
get
but
it
well
known
to
characters
like
myself
that
him
as
has
been
brought
out
o
drowning
can
never
be
drowned
bradley
smiled
sourly
at
the
ignorance
he
would
have
corrected
in
one
of
his
pupils
and
continued
to
look
down
into
the
water
as
if
the
place
had
a
gloomy
fascination
for
him
seem
to
like
it
said
riderhood
he
took
no
notice
but
stood
looking
down
as
if
he
had
not
heard
the
words
there
was
a
very
dark
expression
on
his
face
an
expression
that
the
rogue
found
it
hard
to
understand
it
was
fierce
and
full
of
purpose
but
the
purpose
might
have
been
as
much
against
himself
as
against
another
if
he
had
stepped
back
for
a
spring
taken
a
leap
and
thrown
himself
in
it
would
have
been
no
surprising
sequel
to
the
look
perhaps
his
troubled
soul
set
upon
some
violence
did
hover
for
the
moment
between
that
violence
and
another
you
say
asked
riderhood
after
watching
him
for
a
while
with
a
sidelong
glance
you
had
come
back
for
a
couple
o
hours
rest
but
even
then
he
had
to
jog
him
with
his
elbow
before
he
answered
yes
you
better
come
in
and
take
your
couple
o
hours
rest
you
yes
with
the
look
of
one
just
awakened
he
followed
riderhood
into
the
where
the
latter
produced
from
a
cupboard
some
cold
salt
beef
and
half
a
loaf
some
gin
in
a
bottle
and
some
water
in
a
jug
the
last
he
brought
in
cool
and
dripping
from
the
river
said
riderhood
stooping
over
him
to
put
it
on
the
table
better
take
a
bite
and
a
sup
afore
you
takes
your
snooze
the
draggling
ends
of
the
red
neckerchief
caught
the
schoolmaster
eyes
riderhood
saw
him
look
at
it
thought
that
worthy
notice
are
you
come
you
shall
have
a
good
squint
at
it
then
with
which
reflection
he
sat
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
threw
open
his
vest
and
made
a
pretence
of
the
neckerchief
with
much
deliberation
bradley
ate
and
drank
as
he
sat
at
his
platter
and
mug
riderhood
saw
him
again
and
yet
again
steal
a
look
at
the
neckerchief
as
if
he
were
correcting
his
slow
observation
and
prompting
his
sluggish
memory
you
ready
for
your
snooze
said
that
honest
creature
yourself
on
my
bed
in
the
corner
it
be
broad
day
afore
three
i
call
you
early
shall
require
no
calling
answered
bradley
and
soon
afterwards
divesting
himself
only
of
his
shoes
and
coat
laid
himself
down
riderhood
leaning
back
in
his
wooden
with
his
arms
folded
on
his
breast
looked
at
him
lying
with
his
right
hand
clenched
in
his
sleep
and
his
teeth
set
until
a
film
came
over
his
own
sight
and
he
slept
too
he
awoke
to
find
that
it
was
daylight
and
that
his
visitor
was
already
astir
and
going
out
to
the
to
cool
his
head
i
blest
muttered
riderhood
at
the
door
looking
after
him
i
think
there
water
enough
in
all
the
thames
to
do
that
for
you
within
five
minutes
he
had
taken
his
departure
and
was
passing
on
into
the
calm
distance
as
he
had
passed
yesterday
riderhood
knew
when
a
fish
leaped
by
his
starting
and
glancing
round
ho
lock
at
intervals
all
day
and
ho
lock
thrice
in
the
ensuing
night
but
no
return
of
bradley
the
second
day
was
sultry
and
oppressive
in
the
afternoon
a
thunderstorm
came
up
and
had
but
newly
broken
into
a
furious
sweep
of
rain
when
he
rushed
in
at
the
door
like
the
storm
itself
seen
him
with
her
exclaimed
riderhood
starting
up
have
his
journey
end
his
boat
hauled
up
for
three
days
i
heard
him
give
the
order
then
i
saw
him
wait
for
her
and
meet
her
i
saw
them
he
stopped
as
though
he
were
suffocating
and
began
again
saw
them
walking
side
by
side
last
night
did
you
do
are
you
going
to
do
he
dropped
into
a
chair
and
laughed
immediately
afterwards
a
great
spirt
of
blood
burst
from
his
nose
does
that
happen
asked
riderhood
do
know
i
ca
keep
it
back
it
has
happened
twice
three
times
four
times
i
do
know
how
many
times
since
last
night
i
taste
it
smell
it
see
it
it
chokes
me
and
then
it
breaks
out
like
this
he
went
into
the
pelting
rain
again
with
his
head
bare
and
bending
low
over
the
river
and
scooping
up
the
water
with
his
two
hands
washed
the
blood
away
all
beyond
his
figure
as
riderhood
looked
from
the
door
was
a
vast
dark
curtain
in
solemn
movement
towards
one
quarter
of
the
heavens
he
raised
his
head
and
came
back
wet
from
head
to
foot
but
with
the
lower
parts
of
his
sleeves
where
he
had
dipped
into
the
river
streaming
water
face
is
like
a
ghost
said
riderhood
you
ever
see
a
ghost
was
the
sullen
retort
mean
to
say
you
quite
wore
out
may
well
be
i
have
had
no
rest
since
i
left
here
i
remember
that
i
have
so
much
as
sat
down
since
i
left
here
down
now
then
said
riderhood
will
if
you
give
me
something
to
quench
my
thirst
first
the
bottle
and
jug
were
again
produced
and
he
mixed
a
weak
draught
and
another
and
drank
both
in
quick
succession
asked
me
something
he
said
then
i
did
replied
riderhood
tell
you
retorted
bradley
turning
upon
him
in
a
wild
and
desperate
manner
asked
me
something
before
i
went
out
to
wash
my
face
in
the
river
then
said
riderhood
backing
a
little
asked
you
wot
you
wos
to
do
can
a
man
in
this
state
know
he
answered
protesting
with
both
his
tremulous
hands
with
an
action
so
vigorously
angry
that
he
shook
the
water
from
his
sleeves
upon
the
floor
as
if
he
had
wrung
them
can
i
plan
anything
if
i
have
sleep
that
what
i
as
good
as
said
returned
the
other
i
say
lie
down
perhaps
you
did
anyways
i
says
it
again
sleep
where
you
slept
last
the
sounder
and
longer
you
can
sleep
the
better
you
know
arterwards
what
up
to
his
pointing
to
the
truckle
bed
in
the
corner
seemed
gradually
to
bring
that
poor
couch
to
bradley
wandering
remembrance
he
slipped
off
his
worn
shoes
and
cast
himself
heavily
all
wet
as
he
was
upon
the
bed
riderhood
sat
down
in
his
wooden
and
looked
through
the
window
at
the
lightning
and
listened
to
the
thunder
but
his
thoughts
were
far
from
being
absorbed
by
the
thunder
and
the
lightning
for
again
and
again
and
again
he
looked
very
curiously
at
the
exhausted
man
upon
the
bed
the
man
had
turned
up
the
collar
of
the
rough
coat
he
wore
to
shelter
himself
from
the
storm
and
had
buttoned
it
about
his
neck
unconscious
of
that
and
of
most
things
he
had
left
the
coat
so
both
when
he
had
laved
his
face
in
the
river
and
when
he
had
cast
himself
upon
the
bed
though
it
would
have
been
much
easier
to
him
if
he
had
unloosened
it
the
thunder
rolled
heavily
and
the
forked
lightning
seemed
to
make
jagged
rents
in
every
part
of
the
vast
curtain
without
as
riderhood
sat
by
the
window
glancing
at
the
bed
sometimes
he
saw
the
man
upon
the
bed
by
a
red
light
sometimes
by
a
blue
sometimes
he
scarcely
saw
him
in
the
darkness
of
the
storm
sometimes
he
saw
nothing
of
him
in
the
blinding
glare
of
palpitating
white
fire
anon
the
rain
would
come
again
with
a
tremendous
rush
and
the
river
would
seem
to
rise
to
meet
it
and
a
blast
of
wind
bursting
upon
the
door
would
flutter
the
hair
and
dress
of
the
man
as
if
invisible
messengers
were
come
around
the
bed
to
carry
him
away
from
all
these
phases
of
the
storm
riderhood
would
turn
as
if
they
were
interruptions
rather
striking
interruptions
possibly
but
interruptions
still
of
his
scrutiny
of
the
sleeper
sleeps
sound
he
said
within
himself
he
that
up
to
me
and
that
noticing
of
me
that
my
getting
out
of
my
chair
may
wake
him
when
a
rattling
peal
wo
let
alone
my
touching
of
him
he
very
cautiously
rose
to
his
feet
he
said
in
a
low
calm
voice
you
a
lying
easy
there
a
chill
in
the
air
governor
shall
i
put
a
coat
over
you
no
answer
about
what
it
is
you
see
muttered
riderhood
in
a
lower
and
a
different
voice
coat
over
you
a
coat
over
you
the
sleeper
moving
an
arm
he
sat
down
again
in
his
chair
and
feigned
to
watch
the
storm
from
the
window
it
was
a
grand
spectacle
but
not
so
grand
as
to
keep
his
eyes
for
half
a
minute
together
from
stealing
a
look
at
the
man
upon
the
bed
it
was
at
the
concealed
throat
of
the
sleeper
that
riderhood
so
often
looked
so
curiously
until
the
sleep
seemed
to
deepen
into
the
stupor
of
the
in
mind
and
body
then
riderhood
came
from
the
window
cautiously
and
stood
by
the
bed
man
he
murmured
in
a
low
tone
with
a
crafty
face
and
a
very
watchful
eye
and
ready
foot
lest
he
should
start
up
here
coat
of
his
must
make
him
uneasy
in
his
sleep
shall
i
loosen
it
for
him
and
make
him
more
comfortable
ah
i
think
i
ought
to
do
it
poor
man
i
think
i
will
he
touched
the
first
button
with
a
very
cautious
hand
and
a
step
backward
but
the
sleeper
remaining
in
profound
unconsciousness
he
touched
the
other
buttons
with
a
more
assured
hand
and
perhaps
the
more
lightly
on
that
account
softly
and
slowly
he
opened
the
coat
and
drew
it
back
the
draggling
ends
of
a
neckerchief
were
then
disclosed
and
he
had
even
been
at
the
pains
of
dipping
parts
of
it
in
some
liquid
to
give
it
the
appearance
of
having
become
stained
by
wear
with
a
face
riderhood
looked
from
it
to
the
sleeper
and
from
the
sleeper
to
it
and
finally
crept
back
to
his
chair
and
there
with
his
hand
to
his
chin
sat
long
in
a
brown
study
looking
at
both
chapter
the
golden
dustman
rises
a
little
mr
and
mrs
lammle
had
come
to
breakfast
with
mr
and
mrs
boffin
they
were
not
absolutely
uninvited
but
had
pressed
themselves
with
so
much
urgency
on
the
golden
couple
that
evasion
of
the
honour
and
pleasure
of
their
company
would
have
been
difficult
if
desired
they
were
in
a
charming
state
of
mind
were
mr
and
mrs
lammle
and
almost
as
fond
of
mr
and
mrs
boffin
as
of
one
another
dear
mrs
boffin
said
mrs
lammle
imparts
new
life
to
me
to
see
my
alfred
in
confidential
communication
with
mr
boffin
the
two
were
formed
to
become
intimate
so
much
simplicity
combined
with
so
much
force
of
character
such
natural
sagacity
united
to
such
amiability
and
gentleness
these
are
the
distinguishing
characteristics
of
both
this
being
said
aloud
gave
mr
lammle
an
opportunity
as
he
came
with
mr
boffin
from
the
window
to
the
breakfast
table
of
taking
up
his
dear
and
honoured
wife
sophronia
said
that
gentleman
too
partial
estimate
of
your
husband
character
not
too
partial
alfred
urged
the
lady
tenderly
moved
say
that
child
your
favourable
opinion
then
of
your
husband
you
object
to
that
phrase
darling
can
i
alfred
favourable
opinion
then
my
precious
does
less
than
justice
to
mr
boffin
and
more
than
justice
to
me
the
first
charge
alfred
i
plead
guilty
but
to
the
second
oh
no
no
than
justice
to
mr
boffin
sophronia
said
mr
lammle
soaring
into
a
tone
of
moral
grandeur
it
represents
mr
boffin
as
on
my
lower
level
more
than
justice
to
me
sophronia
because
it
represents
me
as
on
mr
boffin
higher
level
mr
boffin
bears
and
forbears
far
more
than
i
could
more
than
you
could
for
yourself
alfred
love
that
is
not
the
question
the
question
lawyer
said
mrs
lammle
archly
dear
sophronia
from
my
lower
level
i
regard
mr
boffin
as
too
generous
as
possessed
of
too
much
clemency
as
being
too
good
to
persons
who
are
unworthy
of
him
and
ungrateful
to
him
to
those
noble
qualities
i
can
lay
no
claim
on
the
contrary
they
rouse
my
indignation
when
i
see
them
in
action
rouse
my
indignation
my
dear
against
the
unworthy
persons
and
give
me
a
combative
desire
to
stand
between
mr
boffin
and
all
such
persons
why
because
in
my
lower
nature
i
am
more
worldly
and
less
delicate
not
being
so
magnanimous
as
mr
boffin
i
feel
his
injuries
more
than
he
does
himself
and
feel
more
capable
of
opposing
his
injurers
it
struck
mrs
lammle
that
it
appeared
rather
difficult
this
morning
to
bring
mr
and
mrs
boffin
into
agreeable
conversation
here
had
been
several
lures
thrown
out
and
neither
of
them
had
uttered
a
word
here
were
she
mrs
lammle
and
her
husband
discoursing
at
once
affectingly
and
effectively
but
discoursing
alone
assuming
that
the
dear
old
creatures
were
impressed
by
what
they
heard
still
one
would
like
to
be
sure
of
it
the
more
so
as
at
least
one
of
the
dear
old
creatures
was
somewhat
pointedly
referred
to
if
the
dear
old
creatures
were
too
bashful
or
too
dull
to
assume
their
required
places
in
the
discussion
why
then
it
would
seem
desirable
that
the
dear
old
creatures
should
be
taken
by
their
heads
and
shoulders
and
brought
into
it
is
not
my
husband
saying
in
effect
asked
mrs
lammle
therefore
with
an
innocent
air
of
mr
and
mrs
boffin
he
becomes
unmindful
of
his
own
temporary
misfortunes
in
his
admiration
of
another
whom
he
is
burning
to
serve
and
is
not
that
making
an
admission
that
his
nature
is
a
generous
one
i
am
wretched
in
argument
but
surely
this
is
so
dear
mr
and
mrs
boffin
still
neither
mr
and
mrs
boffin
said
a
word
he
sat
with
his
eyes
on
his
plate
eating
his
muffins
and
ham
and
she
sat
shyly
looking
at
the
teapot
mrs
lammle
innocent
appeal
was
merely
thrown
into
the
air
to
mingle
with
the
steam
of
the
urn
glancing
towards
mr
and
mrs
boffin
she
very
slightly
raised
her
eyebrows
as
though
inquiring
of
her
husband
i
notice
anything
wrong
here
mr
lammle
who
had
found
his
chest
effective
on
a
variety
of
occasions
manoeuvred
his
capacious
shirt
front
into
the
largest
demonstration
possible
and
then
smiling
retorted
on
his
wife
thus
darling
mr
and
mrs
boffin
will
remind
you
of
the
old
adage
that
is
no
recommendation
alfred
do
you
mean
because
we
are
one
and
the
same
my
dear
child
i
mean
that
you
can
not
fail
to
remember
if
you
reflect
for
a
single
moment
that
what
you
are
pleased
to
compliment
me
upon
feeling
in
the
case
of
mr
boffin
you
have
yourself
confided
to
me
as
your
own
feeling
in
the
case
of
mrs
boffin
shall
be
beaten
by
this
lawyer
mrs
lammle
gaily
whispered
to
mrs
boffin
am
afraid
i
must
admit
it
if
he
presses
me
for
damagingly
true
several
white
dints
began
to
come
and
go
about
mr
lammle
nose
as
he
observed
that
mrs
boffin
merely
looked
up
from
the
teapot
for
a
moment
with
an
embarrassed
smile
which
was
no
smile
and
then
looked
down
again
you
admit
the
charge
sophronia
inquired
alfred
in
a
rallying
tone
i
think
said
mrs
lammle
still
gaily
must
throw
myself
on
the
protection
of
the
court
am
i
bound
to
answer
that
question
my
lord
to
mr
boffin
need
if
you
do
like
was
his
answer
not
of
the
least
consequence
both
husband
and
wife
glanced
at
him
very
doubtfully
his
manner
was
grave
but
not
coarse
and
derived
some
dignity
from
a
certain
repressed
dislike
of
the
tone
of
the
conversation
again
mrs
lammle
raised
her
eyebrows
for
instruction
from
her
husband
he
replied
in
a
slight
nod
again
protect
myself
against
the
suspicion
of
covert
my
dear
mrs
boffin
said
the
airy
mrs
lammle
therefore
must
tell
you
how
it
was
pray
do
mr
boffin
interposed
mrs
lammle
turned
to
him
laughingly
court
objects
said
mr
boffin
court
if
i
am
the
court
does
object
the
court
objects
for
two
reasons
first
because
the
court
do
think
it
fair
secondly
because
the
dear
old
lady
mrs
court
if
i
am
mr
gets
distressed
by
it
a
very
remarkable
wavering
between
two
bearings
between
her
propitiatory
bearing
there
and
her
defiant
bearing
at
mr
twemlow
was
observable
on
the
part
of
mrs
lammle
as
she
said
does
the
court
not
consider
fair
you
go
on
replied
mr
boffin
nodding
his
head
soothingly
as
who
should
say
we
wo
be
harder
on
you
than
we
can
help
we
make
the
best
of
it
not
and
it
not
fair
when
the
old
lady
is
uncomfortable
there
sure
to
be
good
reason
for
it
i
see
she
is
uncomfortable
and
i
plainly
see
this
is
the
good
reason
wherefore
have
you
breakfasted
mrs
lammle
settling
into
her
defiant
manner
pushed
her
plate
away
looked
at
her
husband
and
laughed
but
by
no
means
gaily
you
breakfasted
sir
inquired
mr
boffin
you
replied
alfred
showing
all
his
teeth
mrs
boffin
will
oblige
me
i
take
another
cup
of
tea
he
spilled
a
little
of
it
over
the
chest
which
ought
to
have
been
so
effective
and
which
had
done
so
little
but
on
the
whole
drank
it
with
something
of
an
air
though
the
coming
and
going
dints
got
almost
as
large
the
while
as
if
they
had
been
made
by
pressure
of
the
teaspoon
thousand
thanks
he
then
observed
have
breakfasted
which
said
mr
boffin
softly
taking
out
a
of
you
two
is
cashier
my
dear
remarked
her
husband
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
waving
his
right
hand
towards
her
while
he
hung
his
left
hand
by
the
thumb
in
the
of
his
waistcoat
shall
be
your
department
would
rather
said
mr
boffin
it
was
your
husband
because
but
never
mind
because
i
would
rather
have
to
do
with
him
however
what
i
have
to
say
i
will
say
with
as
little
offence
as
possible
if
i
can
say
it
without
any
i
shall
be
heartily
glad
you
two
have
done
me
a
service
a
very
great
service
in
doing
what
you
did
my
old
lady
knows
what
it
was
and
i
have
put
into
this
envelope
a
bank
note
for
a
hundred
pound
i
consider
the
service
well
worth
a
hundred
pound
and
i
am
well
pleased
to
pay
the
money
would
you
do
me
the
favour
to
take
it
and
likewise
to
accept
my
thanks
with
a
haughty
action
and
without
looking
towards
him
mrs
lammle
held
out
her
left
hand
and
into
it
mr
boffin
put
the
little
packet
when
she
had
conveyed
it
to
her
bosom
mr
lammle
had
the
appearance
of
feeling
relieved
and
breathing
more
freely
as
not
having
been
quite
certain
that
the
hundred
pounds
were
his
until
the
note
had
been
safely
transferred
out
of
mr
boffin
keeping
into
his
own
sophronia
is
not
impossible
said
mr
boffin
addressing
alfred
you
have
had
some
general
idea
sir
of
replacing
rokesmith
in
course
of
time
is
not
assented
alfred
with
a
glittering
smile
and
a
great
deal
of
nose
impossible
perhaps
pursued
mr
boffin
addressing
sophronia
have
been
so
kind
as
to
take
up
my
old
lady
in
your
own
mind
and
to
do
her
the
honour
of
turning
the
question
over
whether
you
might
one
of
these
days
have
her
in
charge
like
whether
you
might
be
a
sort
of
miss
bella
wilfer
to
her
and
something
more
should
hope
returned
mrs
lammle
with
a
scornful
look
and
in
a
loud
voice
if
i
were
anything
to
your
wife
sir
i
could
hardly
fail
to
be
something
more
than
miss
bella
wilfer
as
you
call
her
do
you
call
her
asked
mr
boffin
mrs
lammle
disdained
to
reply
and
sat
defiantly
beating
one
foot
on
the
ground
i
think
i
may
say
that
not
impossible
is
it
sir
asked
mr
boffin
turning
to
alfred
is
not
said
alfred
smiling
assent
as
before
impossible
said
mr
boffin
gently
wo
do
i
do
wish
to
say
a
single
word
that
might
be
afterwards
remembered
as
unpleasant
but
it
wo
do
my
love
her
husband
repeated
in
a
bantering
manner
hear
it
wo
do
said
mr
boffin
with
his
voice
still
dropped
really
wo
you
positively
must
excuse
us
if
you
go
your
way
we
go
ours
and
so
i
hope
this
affair
ends
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
mrs
lammle
gave
him
the
look
of
a
decidedly
dissatisfied
party
demanding
exemption
from
the
category
but
said
nothing
best
thing
we
can
make
of
the
affair
said
mr
boffin
a
matter
of
business
and
as
a
matter
of
business
it
brought
to
a
conclusion
you
have
done
me
a
great
service
a
very
great
service
and
i
have
paid
for
it
is
there
any
objection
to
the
price
mr
and
mrs
lammle
looked
at
one
another
across
the
table
but
neither
could
say
that
there
was
mr
lammle
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
mrs
lammle
sat
rigid
good
said
mr
boffin
hope
my
old
lady
and
me
that
give
us
credit
for
taking
the
plainest
and
honestest
that
could
be
taken
under
the
circumstances
we
have
talked
it
over
with
a
deal
of
care
my
old
lady
and
me
and
we
have
felt
that
at
all
to
lead
you
on
or
even
at
all
to
let
you
go
on
of
your
own
selves
would
be
the
right
thing
so
i
have
openly
given
you
to
understand
that
mr
boffin
sought
for
a
new
turn
of
speech
but
could
find
none
so
expressive
as
his
former
one
repeated
in
a
confidential
tone
that
it
wo
do
if
i
could
have
put
the
case
more
pleasantly
i
would
but
i
hope
i
have
put
it
very
unpleasantly
at
all
events
i
have
meant
to
so
said
mr
boffin
by
way
of
peroration
you
well
in
the
way
you
go
we
now
conclude
with
the
observation
that
perhaps
you
go
it
mr
lammle
rose
with
an
impudent
laugh
on
his
side
of
the
table
and
mrs
lammle
rose
with
a
disdainful
frown
on
hers
at
this
moment
a
hasty
foot
was
heard
on
the
staircase
and
georgiana
podsnap
broke
into
the
room
unannounced
and
in
tears
my
dear
sophronia
cried
georgiana
wringing
her
hands
as
she
ran
up
to
embrace
her
think
that
you
and
alfred
should
be
ruined
oh
my
poor
dear
sophronia
to
think
that
you
should
have
had
a
sale
at
your
house
after
all
your
kindness
to
me
oh
mr
and
mrs
boffin
pray
forgive
me
for
this
intrusion
but
you
do
know
how
fond
i
was
of
sophronia
when
pa
would
let
me
go
there
any
more
or
what
i
have
felt
for
sophronia
since
i
heard
from
ma
of
her
having
been
brought
low
in
the
world
you
do
you
ca
you
never
can
think
how
i
have
lain
awake
at
night
and
cried
for
my
good
sophronia
my
first
and
only
friend
mrs
lammle
manner
changed
under
the
poor
silly
girl
embraces
and
she
turned
extremely
pale
directing
one
appealing
look
first
to
mrs
boffin
and
then
to
mr
boffin
both
understood
her
instantly
with
a
more
delicate
subtlety
than
much
better
educated
people
whose
perception
came
less
directly
from
the
heart
could
have
brought
to
bear
upon
the
case
have
a
minute
said
poor
little
georgiana
stay
i
am
out
shopping
early
with
ma
and
i
said
i
had
a
headache
and
got
ma
to
leave
me
outside
in
the
phaeton
in
piccadilly
and
ran
round
to
sackville
street
and
heard
that
sophronia
was
here
and
then
ma
came
to
see
oh
such
a
dreadful
old
stony
woman
from
the
country
in
a
turban
in
portland
place
and
i
said
i
would
go
up
with
ma
but
would
drive
round
and
leave
cards
for
the
boffins
which
is
taking
a
liberty
with
the
name
but
oh
my
goodness
i
am
distracted
and
the
phaeton
at
the
door
and
what
would
pa
say
if
he
knew
it
ye
be
timid
my
dear
said
mrs
boffin
came
in
to
see
us
no
i
did
cried
georgiana
very
impolite
i
know
but
i
came
to
see
my
poor
sophronia
my
only
friend
oh
how
i
felt
the
separation
my
dear
sophronia
before
i
knew
you
were
brought
low
in
the
world
and
how
much
more
i
feel
it
now
there
were
actually
tears
in
the
bold
woman
eyes
as
the
and
girl
twined
her
arms
about
her
neck
i
come
on
business
said
georgiana
sobbing
and
drying
her
face
and
then
searching
in
a
little
reticule
if
i
do
despatch
it
i
shall
have
come
for
nothing
and
oh
good
gracious
what
would
pa
say
if
he
knew
of
sackville
street
and
what
would
ma
say
if
she
was
kept
waiting
on
the
doorsteps
of
that
dreadful
turban
and
there
never
were
such
pawing
horses
as
ours
unsettling
my
mind
every
moment
more
and
more
when
i
want
more
mind
than
i
have
got
by
pawing
up
mr
street
where
they
have
no
business
to
be
oh
where
is
where
is
it
oh
i
ca
find
it
all
this
time
sobbing
and
searching
in
the
little
reticule
do
you
miss
my
dear
asked
mr
boffin
stepping
forward
it
little
enough
replied
georgiana
ma
always
treats
me
as
if
i
was
in
the
nursery
i
am
sure
i
wish
i
was
but
i
hardly
ever
spend
it
and
it
has
mounted
up
to
fifteen
pounds
sophronia
and
i
hope
three
notes
are
better
than
nothing
though
so
little
so
little
and
now
i
have
found
that
oh
my
goodness
there
the
other
gone
next
oh
no
it
is
here
it
is
with
that
always
sobbing
and
searching
in
the
reticule
georgiana
produced
a
necklace
says
chits
and
jewels
have
no
business
together
pursued
georgiana
that
the
reason
why
i
have
no
trinkets
except
this
but
i
suppose
my
aunt
hawkinson
was
of
a
different
opinion
because
she
left
me
this
though
i
used
to
think
she
might
just
as
well
have
buried
it
for
always
kept
in
jewellers
cotton
however
here
it
is
i
am
thankful
to
say
and
of
use
at
last
and
you
sell
it
dear
sophronia
and
buy
things
with
it
it
to
me
said
mr
boffin
gently
taking
it
see
that
properly
disposed
of
are
you
such
a
friend
of
sophronia
mr
boffin
cried
georgiana
how
good
of
you
oh
my
gracious
there
was
something
else
and
it
gone
out
of
my
head
oh
no
it
is
i
remember
what
it
was
my
grandmamma
property
that
come
to
me
when
i
am
of
age
mr
boffin
will
be
all
my
own
and
neither
pa
nor
ma
nor
anybody
else
will
have
any
control
over
it
and
what
i
wish
to
do
it
so
make
some
of
it
over
somehow
to
sophronia
and
alfred
by
signing
something
somewhere
prevail
on
somebody
to
advance
them
something
i
want
them
to
have
something
handsome
to
bring
them
up
in
the
world
again
oh
my
goodness
me
being
such
a
friend
of
my
dear
sophronia
you
wo
refuse
me
will
you
no
said
mr
boffin
shall
be
seen
to
thank
you
thank
you
cried
georgiana
my
maid
had
a
little
note
and
half
a
crown
i
could
run
round
to
the
pastrycook
to
sign
something
or
i
could
sign
something
in
the
square
if
somebody
would
come
and
cough
for
me
to
let
in
with
the
key
and
would
bring
a
pen
and
ink
with
and
a
bit
of
oh
my
gracious
i
must
tear
myself
away
or
pa
and
ma
will
both
find
out
dear
dear
sophronia
good
the
credulous
little
creature
again
embraced
mrs
lammle
most
affectionately
and
then
held
out
her
hand
to
mr
lammle
dear
mr
lammle
i
mean
alfred
you
wo
think
after
that
i
have
deserted
you
and
sophronia
because
you
have
been
brought
low
in
the
world
will
you
oh
me
oh
me
i
have
been
crying
my
eyes
out
of
my
head
and
ma
will
be
sure
to
ask
me
what
the
matter
oh
take
me
down
somebody
please
please
please
mr
boffin
took
her
down
and
saw
her
driven
away
with
her
poor
little
red
eyes
and
weak
chin
peering
over
the
great
apron
of
the
phaeton
as
if
she
had
been
ordered
to
expiate
some
childish
misdemeanour
by
going
to
bed
in
the
daylight
and
were
peeping
over
the
counterpane
in
a
miserable
flutter
of
repentance
and
low
spirits
returning
to
the
he
found
mrs
lammle
still
standing
on
her
side
of
the
table
and
mr
lammle
on
his
take
care
said
mr
boffin
showing
the
money
and
the
necklace
these
are
soon
given
back
mrs
lammle
had
taken
up
her
parasol
from
a
side
table
and
stood
sketching
with
it
on
the
pattern
of
the
damask
cloth
as
she
had
sketched
on
the
pattern
of
mr
twemlow
papered
wall
will
not
undeceive
her
i
hope
mr
boffin
she
said
turning
her
head
towards
him
but
not
her
eyes
said
mr
boffin
mean
as
to
the
worth
and
value
of
her
friend
mrs
lammle
explained
in
a
measured
voice
and
with
an
emphasis
on
her
last
word
he
returned
may
try
to
give
a
hint
at
her
home
that
she
is
in
want
of
kind
and
careful
protection
but
i
shall
say
no
more
than
that
to
her
parents
and
i
shall
say
nothing
to
the
young
lady
herself
and
mrs
boffin
said
mrs
lammle
still
sketching
and
seeming
to
bestow
great
pains
upon
it
are
not
many
people
i
think
who
under
the
circumstances
would
have
been
so
considerate
and
sparing
as
you
have
been
to
me
just
now
do
you
care
to
be
thanked
are
always
worth
having
said
mrs
boffin
in
her
ready
good
nature
thank
you
both
asked
her
husband
mockingly
you
sentimental
well
my
good
sir
mr
boffin
interposed
a
very
good
thing
to
think
well
of
another
person
and
it
a
very
good
thing
to
be
thought
well
of
by
another
person
mrs
lammle
will
be
none
the
worse
for
it
if
she
is
obliged
but
i
asked
mrs
lammle
if
she
was
she
stood
sketching
on
the
with
her
face
clouded
and
set
and
was
silent
said
alfred
am
disposed
to
be
sentimental
myself
on
your
appropriation
of
the
jewels
and
the
money
mr
boffin
as
our
little
georgiana
said
three
notes
are
better
than
nothing
and
if
you
sell
a
necklace
you
can
buy
things
with
the
produce
you
sell
it
was
mr
boffin
comment
as
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
alfred
followed
it
with
his
looks
and
also
greedily
pursued
the
notes
until
they
vanished
into
mr
boffin
waistcoat
pocket
then
he
directed
a
look
half
exasperated
and
half
jeering
at
his
wife
she
still
stood
sketching
but
as
she
sketched
there
was
a
struggle
within
her
which
found
expression
in
the
depth
of
the
few
last
lines
the
parasol
point
indented
into
the
and
then
some
tears
fell
from
her
eyes
confound
the
woman
exclaimed
lammle
is
sentimental
she
walked
to
the
window
flinching
under
his
angry
stare
looked
out
for
a
moment
and
turned
round
quite
coldly
have
had
no
former
cause
of
complaint
on
the
sentimental
score
alfred
and
you
will
have
none
in
future
it
is
not
worth
your
noticing
we
go
abroad
soon
with
the
money
we
have
earned
here
know
we
do
you
know
we
must
is
no
fear
of
my
taking
any
sentiment
with
me
i
should
soon
be
eased
of
it
if
i
did
but
it
will
be
all
left
behind
it
is
all
left
behind
are
you
ready
alfred
the
deuce
have
i
been
waiting
for
but
you
sophronia
us
go
then
i
am
sorry
i
have
delayed
our
dignified
departure
she
passed
out
and
he
followed
her
mr
and
mrs
boffin
had
the
curiosity
softly
to
raise
a
window
and
look
after
them
as
they
went
down
the
long
street
they
walked
showily
enough
but
without
appearing
to
interchange
a
syllable
it
might
have
been
fanciful
to
suppose
that
under
their
outer
bearing
there
was
something
of
the
shamed
air
of
two
cheats
who
were
linked
together
by
concealed
handcuffs
but
not
so
to
suppose
that
they
were
haggardly
weary
of
one
another
of
themselves
and
of
all
this
world
in
turning
the
street
corner
they
might
have
turned
out
of
this
world
for
anything
mr
and
mrs
boffin
ever
saw
of
them
to
the
contrary
for
they
set
eyes
on
the
lammles
never
more
chapter
the
golden
dustman
sinks
again
the
evening
of
that
day
being
one
of
the
reading
evenings
at
the
bower
mr
boffin
kissed
mrs
boffin
after
a
five
dinner
and
trotted
out
nursing
his
big
stick
in
both
arms
so
that
as
of
old
it
seemed
to
be
whispering
in
his
ear
he
carried
so
very
attentive
an
expression
on
his
countenance
that
it
appeared
as
if
the
confidential
discourse
of
the
big
stick
required
to
be
followed
closely
mr
boffin
face
was
like
the
face
of
a
thoughtful
listener
to
an
intricate
communication
and
in
trotting
along
he
occasionally
glanced
at
that
companion
with
the
look
of
a
man
who
was
interposing
the
remark
do
mean
it
mr
boffin
and
his
stick
went
on
alone
together
until
they
arrived
at
certain
where
they
would
be
likely
to
fall
in
with
any
one
coming
at
about
the
same
time
from
clerkenwell
to
the
bower
here
they
stopped
and
mr
boffin
consulted
his
watch
wants
five
minutes
good
to
venus
appointment
said
he
rather
early
but
venus
was
a
punctual
man
and
even
as
mr
boffin
replaced
his
watch
in
its
pocket
was
to
be
descried
coming
towards
him
he
quickened
his
pace
on
seeing
mr
boffin
already
at
the
place
of
meeting
and
was
soon
at
his
side
venus
said
mr
boffin
it
would
not
have
been
very
evident
why
he
thanked
the
anatomist
but
for
his
furnishing
the
explanation
in
what
he
went
on
to
say
right
venus
all
right
now
that
you
been
to
see
me
and
have
consented
to
keep
up
the
appearance
before
wegg
of
remaining
in
it
for
a
time
i
have
got
a
sort
of
a
backer
all
right
venus
venus
mr
venus
shook
the
proffered
hand
with
a
modest
air
and
they
pursued
the
direction
of
the
bower
you
think
wegg
is
likely
to
drop
down
upon
me
venus
inquired
mr
boffin
wistfully
as
they
went
along
think
he
is
sir
you
any
particular
reason
for
thinking
so
venus
sir
returned
that
personage
fact
is
he
has
given
me
another
to
make
sure
of
what
he
calls
our
being
correct
and
he
has
mentioned
his
intention
that
he
was
not
to
be
put
off
beginning
with
you
the
very
next
time
you
should
come
and
this
hinted
mr
venus
delicately
the
very
next
time
you
know
sir
therefore
you
suppose
he
turn
to
at
the
grindstone
eh
wegg
said
mr
boffin
so
sir
mr
boffin
took
his
nose
in
his
hand
as
if
it
were
already
excoriated
and
the
sparks
were
beginning
to
fly
out
of
that
feature
a
terrible
fellow
venus
he
an
awful
fellow
i
do
know
how
ever
i
shall
go
through
with
it
you
must
stand
by
me
venus
like
a
good
man
and
true
you
do
all
you
can
to
stand
by
me
venus
wo
you
mr
venus
replied
with
the
assurance
that
he
would
and
mr
boffin
looking
anxious
and
dispirited
pursued
the
way
in
silence
until
they
rang
at
the
bower
gate
the
stumping
approach
of
wegg
was
soon
heard
behind
it
and
as
it
turned
upon
its
hinges
he
became
visible
with
his
hand
on
the
lock
boffin
sir
he
remarked
quite
a
stranger
i
been
otherwise
occupied
wegg
you
indeed
sir
returned
the
literary
gentleman
with
a
threatening
sneer
i
been
looking
for
you
sir
rather
what
i
may
call
specially
do
say
so
wegg
i
do
say
so
sir
and
if
you
had
come
round
to
me
tonight
dash
my
wig
if
i
would
have
come
round
to
you
tomorrow
now
i
tell
you
wrong
i
hope
wegg
no
mr
boffin
was
the
ironical
answer
wrong
what
should
be
wrong
in
boffinses
bower
step
in
sir
if
you
come
to
the
bower
i
shaded
for
you
your
bed
sha
be
roses
all
spangled
with
doo
will
you
will
you
will
you
will
you
come
to
the
bower
oh
wo
you
wo
you
wo
you
wo
you
come
to
the
bower
an
unholy
glare
of
contradiction
and
offence
shone
in
the
eyes
of
mr
wegg
as
he
turned
the
key
on
his
patron
after
ushering
him
into
the
yard
with
this
vocal
quotation
mr
boffin
air
was
crestfallen
and
submissive
whispered
wegg
to
venus
as
they
crossed
the
yard
behind
him
at
the
worm
and
minion
he
down
in
the
mouth
already
whispered
venus
to
wegg
because
i
told
him
i
prepared
the
way
for
you
mr
boffin
entering
the
usual
chamber
laid
his
stick
upon
the
settle
usually
reserved
for
him
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
with
his
shoulders
raised
and
his
hat
drooping
back
upon
them
looking
disconsolately
at
wegg
friend
and
partner
mr
venus
gives
me
to
understand
remarked
that
man
of
might
addressing
him
you
are
aware
of
our
power
over
you
now
when
you
have
took
your
hat
off
go
into
that
pint
mr
boffin
shook
it
off
with
one
shake
so
that
it
dropped
on
the
floor
behind
him
and
remained
in
his
former
attitude
with
his
former
rueful
look
upon
him
of
all
i
to
call
you
boffin
for
short
said
wegg
you
do
like
it
it
open
to
you
to
lump
it
do
mind
it
wegg
mr
boffin
replied
lucky
for
you
boffin
now
do
you
want
to
be
read
to
do
particularly
care
about
it
wegg
if
you
did
want
to
pursued
mr
wegg
the
brilliancy
of
whose
point
was
dimmed
by
his
having
been
unexpectedly
answered
be
i
been
your
slave
long
enough
i
not
to
be
trampled
by
a
dustman
any
more
with
the
single
exception
of
the
salary
i
renounce
the
whole
and
total
sitiwation
you
say
it
is
to
be
so
wegg
returned
mr
boffin
with
folded
hands
suppose
it
must
be
suppose
it
must
be
wegg
retorted
to
clear
the
ground
before
coming
to
business
you
placed
in
this
yard
a
skulking
a
sneaking
and
a
sniffing
menial
had
a
cold
in
his
head
when
i
sent
him
here
said
mr
boffin
retorted
wegg
warn
you
not
to
attempt
a
joke
with
me
here
mr
venus
interposed
and
remarked
that
he
conceived
mr
boffin
to
have
taken
the
description
literally
the
rather
forasmuch
as
he
mr
venus
had
himself
supposed
the
menial
to
have
contracted
an
affliction
or
a
habit
of
the
nose
involving
a
serious
drawback
on
the
pleasures
of
social
intercourse
until
he
had
discovered
that
mr
wegg
description
of
him
was
to
be
accepted
as
merely
figurative
and
every
how
said
wegg
has
been
planted
here
and
he
is
here
now
i
wo
have
him
here
so
i
call
upon
boffin
before
i
say
another
word
to
fetch
him
in
and
send
him
packing
to
the
the
unsuspecting
sloppy
was
at
that
moment
airing
his
many
buttons
within
view
of
the
window
mr
boffin
after
a
short
interval
of
impassive
discomfiture
opened
the
window
and
beckoned
him
to
come
in
call
upon
boffin
said
wegg
with
one
arm
and
his
head
on
one
side
like
a
bullying
counsel
pausing
for
an
answer
from
a
witness
inform
that
menial
that
i
am
master
here
in
humble
obedience
when
the
sloppy
entered
mr
boffin
said
to
him
my
fine
fellow
mr
wegg
is
master
here
he
want
you
and
you
are
to
go
from
here
good
mr
wegg
severely
stipulated
good
said
mr
boffin
sloppy
stared
with
both
his
eyes
and
all
his
buttons
and
his
mouth
wide
open
but
was
without
loss
of
time
escorted
forth
by
silas
wegg
pushed
out
at
the
yard
gate
by
the
shoulders
and
locked
out
atomspear
said
wegg
stumping
back
into
the
room
again
a
little
reddened
by
his
late
exertion
now
freer
for
the
purposes
of
respiration
mr
venus
sir
take
a
chair
boffin
you
may
sit
down
mr
boffin
still
with
his
hands
ruefully
stuck
in
his
pockets
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
settle
shrunk
into
a
small
compass
and
eyed
the
potent
silas
with
conciliatory
looks
gentleman
said
silas
wegg
pointing
out
venus
gentleman
boffin
is
more
milk
and
watery
with
you
than

be
but
he
borne
the
roman
yoke
as
i
have
nor
yet
he
has
been
required
to
pander
to
your
depraved
appetite
for
miserly
characters
never
meant
my
dear
wegg
mr
boffin
was
beginning
when
silas
stopped
him
your
tongue

when
you
called
upon

answer

you
got
quite
enough
to
do
now

of
property

said
mr
boffin
glancing
towards
him
for
any
support
he
could
give
tell
you
so
returned
silas
here
my
hat
boffin
and
my
trifle
with
me
and
instead
of
making
a
bargain
with
you
i
put
on
my
hat
and
take
up
my
and
go
out
and
make
a
bargain
with
the
rightful
owner
now
what
do
you
say
say
returned
mr
boffin
leaning
forward
in
alarmed
appeal
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
i
am
sure
i
do
want
to
trifle
wegg
i
have
said
so
to
venus
certainly
have
sir
said
venus
too
milk
and
watery
with
our
friend
you
are
indeed
remonstrated
silas
with
a
disapproving
shake
of
his
wooden
head
at
once
you
confess
yourself
desirous
to
come
to
terms
do
you
boffin
before
you
answer
keep
this
hat
well
in
your
mind
and
also
this

to
come
to
terms
wo

boffin
i
wo
take
willing
are
you
desirous
to
come
to
terms
do
you
ask
to
be
allowed
as
a
favour
to
come
to
terms
mr
wegg
again
planted
his
arm
and
put
his
head
on
one
side
what
said
the
inexorable
wegg
wo
take
yes
i
have
it
out
of
you
in
full
boffin
me
cried
that
unfortunate
gentleman
am
so
worrited
i
ask
to
be
allowed
to
come
to
terms
supposing
your
document
is
all
correct
you
be
afraid
of
that
said
silas
poking
his
head
at
him
shall
be
satisfied
by
seeing
it
mr
venus
will
show
it
you
and
hold
you
the
while
then
you
want
to
know
what
the
terms
are
is
that
about
the
sum
and
substance
of
it
will
you
or
wo
you
answer
boffin
for
he
had
paused
a
moment
me
cried
that
unfortunate
gentleman
again
am
worrited
to
that
degree
that
i
almost
off
my
head
you
hurry
me
so
be
so
good
as
name
the
terms
wegg
mark
boffin
returned
silas
well
because
the
lowest
terms
and
the
only
terms
you
throw
your
mound
the
little
mound
as
comes
to
you
any
way
into
the
general
estate
and
then
divide
the
whole
property
into
three
parts
and
you
keep
one
and
hand
over
the
others
mr
venus
mouth
screwed
itself
up
as
mr
boffin
face
lengthened
itself
mr
venus
not
having
been
prepared
for
such
a
rapacious
demand
wait
a
bit
boffin
wegg
proceeded
something
more
you
been
a
squandering
this
property
laying
some
of
it
out
on
yourself
that
wo
do
you
bought
a
house
you
be
charged
for
it
shall
be
ruined
wegg
mr
boffin
faintly
protested
wait
a
bit
boffin
there
something
more
you
leave
me
in
sole
custody
of
these
mounds
till
they
all
laid
low
if
any
waluables
should
be
found
in
i
take
care
of
such
waluables
you
produce
your
contract
for
the
sale
of
the
mounds
that
we
may
know
to
a
penny
what
they
worth
and
you
make
out
likewise
an
exact
list
of
all
the
other
property
when
the
mounds
is
cleared
away
to
the
last
the
final
diwision
will
come
off
dreadful
dreadful
i
shall
die
in
a
workhouse
cried
the
golden
dustman
with
his
hands
to
his
head
wait
a
bit
boffin
there
something
more
you
been
unlawfully
ferreting
about
this
yard
you
been
seen
in
the
act
of
ferreting
about
this
yard
two
pair
of
eyes
at
the
present
moment
brought
to
bear
upon
you
have
seen
you
dig
up
a
dutch
bottle
was
mine
wegg
protested
mr
boffin
put
it
there
myself
was
in
it
boffin
inquired
silas
gold
not
silver
not
bank
notes
not
jewels
nothing
that
you
could
turn
into
money
wegg
upon
my
soul
mr
venus
said
wegg
turning
to
his
partner
with
a
knowing
and
superior
air
an
ewasive
answer
on
the
part
of
our
dusty
friend
here
i
have
hit
out
a
little
idea
which
i
think
will
meet
your
views
we
charge
that
bottle
against
our
dusty
friend
at
a
thousand
pound
mr
boffin
drew
a
deep
groan
wait
a
bit
boffin
there
something
more
in
your
employment
is
an
sneak
named
rokesmith
it
wo
answer
to
have
him
about
while
this
business
of
ours
is
about
he
must
be
discharged
is
already
discharged
said
mr
boffin
speaking
in
a
muffled
voice
with
his
hands
before
his
face
as
he
rocked
himself
on
the
settle
discharged
is
he
returned
wegg
surprised
then
boffin
i
believe
there
nothing
more
at
present
the
unlucky
gentleman
continuing
to
rock
himself
to
and
fro
and
to
utter
an
occasional
moan
mr
venus
besought
him
to
bear
up
against
his
reverses
and
to
take
time
to
accustom
himself
to
the
thought
of
his
new
position
but
his
taking
time
was
exactly
the
thing
of
all
others
that
silas
wegg
could
not
be
induced
to
hear
of
or
no
and
no
half
measures
was
the
motto
which
that
obdurate
person
many
times
repeated
shaking
his
fist
at
mr
boffin
and
pegging
his
motto
into
the
floor
with
his
wooden
leg
in
a
threatening
and
alarming
manner
at
length
mr
boffin
entreated
to
be
allowed
a
quarter
of
an
grace
and
a
cooling
walk
of
that
duration
in
the
yard
with
some
difficulty
mr
wegg
granted
this
great
favour
but
only
on
condition
that
he
accompanied
mr
boffin
in
his
walk
as
not
knowing
what
he
might
fraudulently
unearth
if
he
were
left
to
himself
a
more
absurd
sight
than
mr
boffin
in
his
mental
irritation
trotting
very
nimbly
and
mr
wegg
hopping
after
him
with
great
exertion
eager
to
watch
the
slightest
turn
of
an
eyelash
lest
it
should
indicate
a
spot
rich
with
some
secret
assuredly
had
never
been
seen
in
the
shadow
of
the
mounds
mr
wegg
was
much
distressed
when
the
quarter
of
an
hour
expired
and
came
hopping
in
a
very
bad
second
ca
help
myself
cried
mr
boffin
flouncing
on
the
settle
in
a
forlorn
manner
with
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
as
if
his
pockets
had
sunk
the
good
of
my
pretending
to
stand
out
when
i
help
myself
i
must
give
in
to
the
terms
but
i
should
like
to
see
the
document
wegg
who
was
all
for
clinching
the
nail
he
had
so
strongly
driven
home
announced
that
boffin
should
see
it
without
an
hour
delay
taking
him
into
custody
for
that
purpose
or
overshadowing
him
as
if
he
really
were
his
evil
genius
in
visible
form
mr
wegg
clapped
mr
boffin
hat
upon
the
back
of
his
head
and
walked
him
out
by
the
arm
asserting
a
proprietorship
over
his
soul
and
body
that
was
at
once
more
grim
and
more
ridiculous
than
anything
in
mr
venus
rare
collection
that
gentleman
followed
close
upon
their
heels
at
least
backing
up
mr
boffin
in
a
literal
sense
if
he
had
not
had
recent
opportunities
of
doing
so
spiritually
while
mr
boffin
trotting
on
as
hard
as
he
could
trot
involved
silas
wegg
in
frequent
collisions
with
the
public
much
as
a
blind
man
dog
may
be
seen
to
involve
his
master
thus
they
reached
mr
venus
establishment
somewhat
heated
by
the
nature
of
their
progress
thither
mr
wegg
especially
was
in
a
flaming
glow
and
stood
in
the
little
shop
panting
and
mopping
his
head
with
his
speechless
for
several
minutes
meanwhile
mr
venus
who
had
left
the
duelling
frogs
to
fight
it
out
in
his
absence
by
candlelight
for
the
public
delectation
put
the
shutters
up
when
all
was
snug
and
the
fastened
he
said
to
the
perspiring
silas
suppose
mr
wegg
we
may
now
produce
the
paper
on
a
minute
sir
replied
that
discreet
character
on
a
minute
will
you
obligingly
shove
that
box
which
you
mentioned
on
a
former
occasion
as
containing
miscellanies
towards
me
in
the
midst
of
the
shop
here
mr
venus
did
as
he
was
asked
good
said
silas
looking
about
ry
good
will
you
hand
me
that
chair
sir
to
put
of
it
venus
handed
him
the
chair
boffin
said
wegg
up
here
and
take
your
seat
will
you
mr
boffin
as
if
he
were
about
to
have
his
portrait
painted
or
to
be
electrified
or
to
be
made
a
freemason
or
to
be
placed
at
any
other
solitary
disadvantage
ascended
the
rostrum
prepared
for
him
mr
venus
said
silas
taking
off
his
coat
i
catches
our
friend
here
round
the
arms
and
body
and
pins
him
tight
to
the
back
of
the
chair
you
may
show
him
what
he
wants
to
see
if
you
open
it
and
hold
it
well
up
in
one
hand
sir
and
a
candle
in
the
other
he
can
read
it
charming
mr
boffin
seemed
rather
inclined
to
object
to
these
precautionary
arrangements
but
being
immediately
embraced
by
wegg
resigned
himself
venus
then
produced
the
document
and
mr
boffin
slowly
spelt
it
out
aloud
so
very
slowly
that
wegg
who
was
holding
him
in
the
chair
with
the
grip
of
a
wrestler
became
again
exceedingly
the
worse
for
his
exertions
when
you
put
it
safe
back
mr
venus
he
uttered
with
difficulty
the
strain
of
this
is
terrimenjious
at
length
the
document
was
restored
to
its
place
and
wegg
whose
uncomfortable
attitude
had
been
that
of
a
very
persevering
man
unsuccessfully
attempting
to
stand
upon
his
head
took
a
seat
to
recover
himself
mr
boffin
for
his
part
made
no
attempt
to
come
down
but
remained
aloft
disconsolate
boffin
said
wegg
as
soon
as
he
was
in
a
condition
to
speak
you
know
wegg
said
mr
boffin
meekly
i
know
have
no
doubts
about
it
boffin
wegg
no
wegg
none
was
the
slow
and
sad
reply
take
care
you
said
wegg
you
stick
to
your
conditions
mr
venus
if
on
this
auspicious
occasion
you
should
happen
to
have
a
drop
of
anything
not
quite
so
mild
as
tea
in
the
i
think
i
take
the
friendly
liberty
of
asking
you
for
a
specimen
of
it
mr
venus
reminded
of
the
duties
of
hospitality
produced
some
rum
in
answer
to
the
inquiry
you
mix
it
mr
wegg
that
gentleman
pleasantly
rejoined
think
not
sir
on
so
auspicious
an
occasion
i
prefer
to
take
it
in
the
form
of
a
mr
boffin
declining
rum
being
still
elevated
on
his
pedestal
was
in
a
convenient
position
to
be
addressed
wegg
having
eyed
him
with
an
impudent
air
at
leisure
addressed
him
therefore
while
refreshing
himself
with
his
dram
fin
wegg
he
answered
coming
out
of
a
fit
of
abstraction
with
a
sigh
have
mentioned
one
thing
because
it
a
detail
that
comes
of
course
you
must
be
followed
up
you
know
you
must
be
kept
under
inspection
do
quite
understand
said
mr
boffin
you
sneered
wegg
your
wits
boffin
till
the
mounds
is
down
and
this
business
completed
you
accountable
for
all
the
property
recollect
consider
yourself
accountable
to
me
mr
venus
here
being
too
milk
and
watery
with
you
i
am
the
boy
for
you
been
said
mr
boffin
in
a
tone
of
despondency
i
must
keep
the
knowledge
from
my
old
lady
knowledge
of
the
diwision
d
mean
inquired
wegg
helping
himself
to
a
third
for
he
had
already
taken
a
second
if
she
was
to
die
first
of
us
two
she
might
then
think
all
her
life
poor
thing
that
i
had
got
the
rest
of
the
fortune
still
and
was
saving
it
suspect
boffin
returned
wegg
shaking
his
head
sagaciously
and
bestowing
a
wooden
wink
upon
him
you
found
out
some
account
of
some
old
chap
supposed
to
be
a
miser
who
got
himself
the
credit
of
having
much
more
money
than
he
had
however
i
do
mind
you
see
wegg
mr
boffin
feelingly
represented
to
him
you
see
my
old
lady
has
got
so
used
to
the
property
it
would
be
such
a
hard
surprise
do
see
it
at
all
blustered
wegg
have
as
much
as
i
shall
and
who
are
you
then
again
mr
boffin
gently
represented
old
lady
has
very
upright
principles
your
old
lady
returned
wegg
set
herself
up
for
having
uprighter
principles
than
mine
mr
boffin
seemed
a
little
less
patient
at
this
point
than
at
any
other
of
the
negotiations
but
he
commanded
himself
and
said
tamely
enough
think
it
must
be
kept
from
my
old
lady
wegg
said
wegg
contemptuously
though
perhaps
perceiving
some
hint
of
danger
otherwise
it
from
your
old
lady
i
ai
going
to
tell
her
i
can
have
you
under
close
inspection
without
that
i
as
good
a
man
as
you
and
better
ask
me
to
dinner
give
me
the
run
of
your
i
was
good
enough
for
you
and
your
old
lady

when
i
helped
you
out

your
weal
and
hammers
was
there

jane
and
uncle

before
you
two
mr
wegg
gently
venus
urged
and
you
mean
sir
he
returned
with
some
little
thickness
of
speech
in
consequence
of
the
having
tickled
it
got
him
under
inspection
and
i
inspect
him
along
the
line

signal
ran
england
expects
as
this
present
man
will
keep
boffin
to
his
boffin
i
see
you
home
mr
boffin
descended
with
an
air
of
resignation
and
gave
himself
up
after
taking
friendly
leave
of
mr
venus
once
more
inspector
and
inspected
went
through
the
streets
together
and
so
arrived
at
mr
boffin
door
but
even
there
when
mr
boffin
had
given
his
keeper
and
had
let
himself
in
with
his
key
and
had
softly
closed
the
door
even
there
and
then
the
silas
must
needs
claim
another
assertion
of
his
power
fin
he
called
through
the
keyhole
wegg
was
the
reply
through
the
same
channel
out
show
yourself
again
let
have
another
look
at
you
mr
boffin
ah
how
fallen
from
the
high
estate
of
his
honest
simplicity
opened
the
door
and
obeyed
in
you
may
get
to
bed
now
said
wegg
with
a
grin
the
door
was
hardly
closed
when
he
again
called
through
the
keyhole
fin
wegg
this
time
silas
made
no
reply
but
laboured
with
a
will
at
turning
an
imaginary
grindstone
outside
the
keyhole
while
mr
boffin
stooped
at
it
within
he
then
laughed
silently
and
stumped
home

cherubic
pa
arose
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
from
beside
majestic
ma
one
morning
early
having
a
holiday
before
him
pa
and
the
lovely
woman
had
a
rather
particular
appointment
to
keep
yet
pa
and
the
lovely
woman
were
not
going
out
together
bella
was
up
before
four
but
had
no
bonnet
on
she
was
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
was
sitting
on
the
bottom
stair
in
fact
to
receive
pa
when
he
came
down
but
her
only
object
seemed
to
be
to
get
pa
well
out
of
the
house
breakfast
is
ready
sir
whispered
bella
after
greeting
him
with
a
hug
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
eat
it
up
and
drink
it
up
and
escape
how
do
you
feel
pa
the
best
of
my
judgement
like
a
housebreaker
new
to
the
business
my
dear
who
ca
make
himself
quite
comfortable
till
he
is
off
the
premises
bella
tucked
her
arm
in
his
with
a
merry
noiseless
laugh
and
they
went
down
to
the
kitchen
on
tiptoe
she
stopping
on
every
separate
stair
to
put
the
tip
of
her
forefinger
on
her
rosy
lips
and
then
lay
it
on
his
lips
according
to
her
favourite
petting
way
of
kissing
do
you
feel
my
love
asked
as
she
gave
him
his
breakfast
feel
as
if
the
was
coming
true
dear
pa
and
the
fair
little
man
was
turning
out
as
was
predicted
only
the
fair
little
man
said
her
father
bella
put
another
of
those
upon
his
lips
and
then
said
kneeling
down
by
him
as
he
sat
at
table
look
here
sir
if
you
keep
well
up
to
the
mark
this
day
what
do
you
think
you
deserve
what
did
i
promise
you
should
have
if
you
were
good
upon
a
certain
occasion
my
word
i
do
remember
precious
yes
i
do
though
it
one
of
these
beau
tiful
tresses
with
his
caressing
hand
upon
her
hair
it
too
returned
bella
pretending
to
pout
my
word
do
you
know
sir
that
the
would
give
five
thousand
guineas
if
it
was
quite
convenient
to
him
which
it
is
for
the
lovely
piece
i
have
cut
off
for
you
you
can
form
no
idea
sir
of
the
number
of
times
he
kissed
quite
a
scrubby
little
piece
in
comparison
that
i
cut
off
for
him
and
he
wears
it
too
round
his
neck
i
can
tell
you
near
his
heart
said
bella
nodding
very
near
his
heart
however
you
have
been
a
good
good
boy
and
you
are
the
best
of
all
the
dearest
boys
that
ever
were
this
morning
and
here
the
chain
i
have
made
of
it
pa
and
you
must
let
me
put
it
round
your
neck
with
my
own
loving
hands
as
pa
bent
his
head
she
cried
over
him
a
little
and
then
said
after
having
stopped
to
dry
her
eyes
on
his
white
waistcoat
the
discovery
of
which
incongruous
circumstance
made
her
laugh
darling
pa
give
me
your
hands
that
i
may
fold
them
together
and
do
you
say
after
me
my
little
bella
little
bella
repeated
am
very
fond
of
you
am
very
fond
of
you
my
darling
said
must
say
anything
not
dictated
to
you
sir
you
dare
do
it
in
your
responses
at
church
and
you
must
do
it
in
your
responses
out
of
church
withdraw
the
darling
said
a
pious
boy
now
again
you
were
always
were
always
repeated
vexatious
you
were
said
vexatious
do
you
hear
sir
a
vexatious
capricious
thankless
troublesome
animal
but
i
hope
you
do
better
in
the
time
to
come
and
i
bless
you
and
forgive
you
here
she
quite
forgot
that
it
was
pa
turn
to
make
the
responses
and
clung
to
his
neck
pa
if
you
knew
how
much
i
think
this
morning
of
what
you
told
me
once
about
the
first
time
of
our
seeing
old
mr
harmon
when
i
stamped
and
screamed
and
beat
you
with
my
detestable
little
bonnet
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
stamping
and
screaming
and
beating
you
with
my
hateful
little
bonnet
ever
since
i
was
born
darling
my
love
and
as
to
your
bonnets
they
have
always
been
nice
bonnets
for
they
have
always
become
you
or
you
have
become
them
perhaps
it
was
that
at
every
age
i
hurt
you
much
poor
little
pa
asked
bella
laughing
notwithstanding
her
repentance
with
fantastic
pleasure
in
the
picture
i
beat
you
with
my
bonnet
my
child
would
have
hurt
a
fly
but
i
am
afraid
i
should
have
beat
you
at
all
unless
i
had
meant
to
hurt
you
said
bella
i
pinch
your
legs
pa
much
my
dear
but
i
think
it
almost
time
i
yes
cried
bella
i
go
on
chattering
you
be
taken
alive
fly
pa
fly
so
they
went
softly
up
the
kitchen
stairs
on
tiptoe
and
bella
with
her
light
hand
softly
removed
the
fastenings
of
the
house
door
and
pa
having
received
a
parting
hug
made
off
when
he
had
gone
a
little
way
he
looked
back
upon
which
bella
set
another
of
those
finger
seals
upon
the
air
and
thrust
out
her
little
foot
expressive
of
the
mark
pa
in
appropriate
action
expressed
fidelity
to
the
mark
and
made
off
as
fast
as
he
could
go
bella
walked
thoughtfully
in
the
garden
for
an
hour
and
more
and
then
returning
to
the
bedroom
where
lavvy
the
irrepressible
still
slumbered
put
on
a
little
bonnet
of
quiet
but
on
the
whole
of
sly
appearance
which
she
had
yesterday
made
am
going
for
a
walk
lavvy
she
said
as
she
stooped
down
and
kissed
her
the
irrepressible
with
a
bounce
in
the
bed
and
a
remark
that
it
was
time
to
get
up
yet
relapsed
into
unconsciousness
if
she
had
come
out
of
it
behold
bella
tripping
along
the
streets
the
dearest
girl
afoot
under
the
summer
sun
behold
pa
waiting
for
bella
behind
a
pump
at
least
three
miles
from
the
parental
behold
bella
and
pa
aboard
an
early
steamboat
for
greenwich
were
they
expected
at
greenwich
probably
at
least
mr
john
rokesmith
was
on
the
pier
looking
out
about
a
couple
of
hours
before
the
coaly
but
to
him
little
steamboat
got
her
steam
up
in
london
probably
at
least
mr
john
rokesmith
seemed
perfectly
satisfied
when
he
descried
them
on
board
probably
at
least
bella
no
sooner
stepped
ashore
than
she
took
mr
john
rokesmith
arm
without
evincing
surprise
and
the
two
walked
away
together
with
an
ethereal
air
of
happiness
which
as
it
were
wafted
up
from
the
earth
and
drew
after
them
a
gruff
and
glum
old
pensioner
to
see
it
out
two
wooden
legs
had
this
gruff
and
glum
old
pensioner
and
a
minute
before
bella
stepped
out
of
the
boat
and
drew
that
confiding
little
arm
of
hers
through
rokesmith
he
had
had
no
object
in
life
but
tobacco
and
not
enough
of
that
stranded
was
gruff
and
glum
in
a
harbour
of
everlasting
mud
when
all
in
an
instant
bella
floated
him
and
away
he
went
say
cherubic
parent
taking
the
lead
in
what
direction
do
we
steer
first
with
some
such
inquiry
in
his
thoughts
gruff
and
glum
stricken
by
so
sudden
an
interest
that
he
perked
his
neck
and
looked
over
the
intervening
people
as
if
he
were
trying
to
stand
on
tiptoe
with
his
two
wooden
legs
took
an
observation
of
there
was
no
in
the
case
gruff
and
glum
made
out
the
cherubic
parent
was
bearing
down
and
crowding
on
direct
for
greenwich
church
to
see
his
relations
for
gruff
and
glum
though
most
events
acted
on
him
simply
as
pressing
down
and
condensing
the
quids
within
him
might
be
imagined
to
trace
a
family
resemblance
between
the
cherubs
in
the
church
architecture
and
the
cherub
in
the
white
waistcoat
some
remembrance
of
old
valentines
wherein
a
cherub
less
appropriately
attired
for
a
proverbially
uncertain
climate
had
been
seen
conducting
lovers
to
the
altar
might
have
been
fancied
to
inflame
the
ardour
of
his
timber
toes
be
it
as
it
might
he
gave
his
moorings
the
slip
and
followed
in
chase
the
cherub
went
before
all
beaming
smiles
bella
and
john
rokesmith
followed
gruff
and
glum
stuck
to
them
like
wax
for
years
the
wings
of
his
mind
had
gone
to
look
after
the
legs
of
his
body
but
bella
had
brought
them
back
for
him
per
steamer
and
they
were
spread
again
he
was
a
slow
sailer
on
a
wind
of
happiness
but
he
took
a
cross
cut
for
the
rendezvous
and
pegged
away
as
if
he
were
scoring
furiously
at
cribbage
when
the
shadow
of
the
swallowed
them
up
victorious
gruff
and
glum
likewise
presented
himself
to
be
swallowed
up
and
by
this
time
the
cherubic
parent
was
so
fearful
of
surprise
that
but
for
the
two
wooden
legs
on
which
gruff
and
glum
was
reassuringly
mounted
his
conscience
might
have
introduced
in
the
person
of
that
pensioner
his
own
stately
lady
disguised
arrived
at
greenwich
in
a
car
and
griffins
like
the
spiteful
fairy
at
the
christenings
of
the
princesses
to
do
something
dreadful
to
the
marriage
service
and
truly
he
had
a
momentary
reason
to
be
pale
of
face
and
to
whisper
to
bella
do
think
that
can
be
your
ma
do
you
my
dear
on
account
of
a
mysterious
rustling
and
a
stealthy
movement
somewhere
in
the
remote
neighbourhood
of
the
organ
though
it
was
gone
directly
and
was
heard
no
more
albeit
it
was
heard
of
afterwards
as
will
afterwards
be
read
in
this
veracious
register
of
marriage
who
taketh
i
john
and
so
do
i
bella
who
giveth
i
forasmuch
gruff
and
glum
as
john
and
bella
have
consented
together
in
holy
wedlock
you
may
in
short
consider
it
done
and
withdraw
your
two
wooden
legs
from
this
temple
to
the
foregoing
purport
the
minister
speaking
as
directed
by
the
rubric
to
the
people
selectly
represented
in
the
present
instance
by
and
above
mentioned
and
now
the
having
swallowed
up
bella
wilfer
for
ever
and
ever
had
it
not
in
its
power
to
relinquish
that
young
woman
but
slid
into
the
happy
sunlight
mrs
john
rokesmith
instead
and
long
on
the
bright
steps
stood
gruff
and
glum
looking
after
the
pretty
bride
with
a
narcotic
consciousness
of
having
dreamed
a
dream
after
which
bella
took
out
from
her
pocket
a
little
letter
and
read
it
aloud
to
pa
and
john
this
being
a
true
copy
of
the
same
ma
i
hope
you
wo
be
angry
but
i
am
most
happily
married
to
mr
john
rokesmith
who
loves
me
better
than
i
can
ever
deserve
except
by
loving
him
with
all
my
heart
i
thought
it
best
not
to
mention
it
beforehand
in
case
it
should
cause
any
little
difference
at
home
please
tell
darling
with
love
to
lavvy
ever
dearest
ma
your
affectionate
daughter
bella
rokesmith
then
john
rokesmith
put
the
queen
countenance
on
the
letter
when
had
her
gracious
majesty
looked
so
benign
as
on
that
blessed
morning
and
then
bella
popped
it
into
the
and
said
merrily
dearest
pa
you
are
safe
and
will
never
be
taken
alive
pa
was
at
first
in
the
stirred
depths
of
his
conscience
so
far
from
sure
of
being
safe
yet
that
he
made
out
majestic
matrons
lurking
in
ambush
among
the
harmless
trees
of
greenwich
park
and
seemed
to
see
a
stately
countenance
tied
up
in
a
glooming
down
at
him
from
a
window
of
the
observatory
where
the
familiars
of
the
astronomer
royal
nightly
outwatch
the
winking
stars
but
the
minutes
passing
on
and
no
mrs
wilfer
in
the
flesh
appearing
he
became
more
confident
and
so
repaired
with
good
heart
and
appetite
to
mr
and
mrs
john
rokesmith
cottage
on
blackheath
where
breakfast
was
ready
a
modest
little
cottage
but
a
bright
and
a
fresh
and
on
the
snowy
tablecloth
the
prettiest
of
little
breakfasts
in
waiting
too
like
an
attendant
summer
breeze
a
fluttering
young
damsel
all
pink
and
ribbons
blushing
as
if
she
had
been
married
instead
of
bella
and
yet
asserting
the
triumph
of
her
sex
over
both
john
and
pa
in
an
exulting
and
exalted
flurry
as
who
should
say
is
what
you
must
all
come
to
gentlemen
when
we
choose
to
bring
you
to
book
this
same
young
damsel
was
bella
and
unto
her
did
deliver
a
bunch
of
keys
commanding
treasures
in
the
way
of
groceries
jams
and
pickles
the
investigation
of
which
made
pastime
after
breakfast
when
bella
declared
that
must
taste
everything
john
dear
or
it
will
never
be
lucky
and
when
pa
had
all
sorts
of
things
poked
into
his
mouth
and
did
quite
know
what
to
do
with
them
when
they
were
put
there
then
they
all
three
out
for
a
charming
ride
and
for
a
charming
stroll
among
heath
in
bloom
and
there
behold
the
identical
gruff
and
glum
with
his
wooden
legs
horizontally
disposed
before
him
apparently
sitting
meditating
on
the
vicissitudes
of
life
to
whom
said
bella
in
her
surprise
how
do
you
do
again
what
a
dear
old
pensioner
you
are
to
which
gruff
and
glum
responded
that
he
see
her
married
this
morning
my
beauty
and
that
if
it
war
a
liberty
he
wished
her
ji
and
the
fairest
of
fair
wind
and
weather
further
in
a
general
way
requesting
to
know
what
cheer
and
scrambling
up
on
his
two
wooden
legs
to
salute
hat
in
hand
with
the
gallantry
of
a
and
a
heart
of
oak
it
was
a
pleasant
sight
in
the
midst
of
the
golden
bloom
to
see
this
salt
old
gruff
and
glum
waving
his
shovel
hat
at
bella
while
his
thin
white
hair
flowed
free
as
if
she
had
once
more
launched
him
into
blue
water
again
are
a
charming
old
pensioner
said
bella
i
am
so
happy
that
i
wish
i
could
make
you
happy
too
answered
gruff
and
glum
me
leave
to
kiss
your
hand
my
lovely
and
it
done
so
it
was
done
to
the
general
contentment
and
if
gruff
and
glum
did
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
splice
the
main
brace
it
was
not
for
want
of
the
means
of
inflicting
that
outrage
on
the
feelings
of
the
infant
bands
of
hope
but
the
marriage
dinner
was
the
crowning
success
for
what
had
bride
and
bridegroom
plotted
to
do
but
to
have
and
to
hold
that
dinner
in
the
very
room
of
the
very
hotel
where
pa
and
the
lovely
woman
had
once
dined
together
bella
sat
between
pa
and
john
and
divided
her
attentions
pretty
equally
but
felt
it
necessary
in
the
waiter
absence
before
dinner
to
remind
pa
that
she
was
his
lovely
woman
no
longer
am
well
aware
of
it
my
dear
returned
the
cherub
i
resign
you
willingly
sir
you
ought
to
be
brokenhearted
i
should
be
my
dear
if
i
thought
that
i
was
going
to
lose
you
you
know
you
are
not
do
you
poor
dear
pa
you
know
that
you
have
only
made
a
new
relation
who
will
be
as
fond
of
you
and
as
thankful
to
you
for
my
sake
and
your
own
sake
both
as
i
am
do
you
dear
little
pa
look
here
pa
bella
put
her
finger
on
her
own
lip
and
then
on
pa
and
then
on
her
own
lip
again
and
then
on
her
husband
we
are
a
partnership
of
three
dear
the
appearance
of
dinner
here
cut
bella
short
in
one
of
her
disappearances
the
more
effectually
because
it
was
put
on
under
the
auspices
of
a
solemn
gentleman
in
black
clothes
and
a
white
cravat
who
looked
much
more
like
a
clergyman
than
the
clergyman
and
seemed
to
have
mounted
a
great
deal
higher
in
the
church
not
to
say
scaled
the
steeple
this
dignitary
conferring
in
secrecy
with
john
rokesmith
on
the
subject
of
punch
and
wines
bent
his
head
as
though
stooping
to
the
papistical
practice
of
receiving
auricular
confession
likewise
on
john
offering
a
suggestion
which
did
meet
his
views
his
face
became
overcast
and
reproachful
as
enjoining
penance
what
a
dinner
specimens
of
all
the
fishes
that
swim
in
the
sea
surely
had
swum
their
way
to
it
and
if
samples
of
the
fishes
of
divers
colours
that
made
a
speech
in
the
arabian
nights
quite
a
ministerial
explanation
in
respect
of
cloudiness
and
then
jumped
out
of
the
were
not
to
be
recognized
it
was
only
because
they
had
all
become
of
one
hue
by
being
cooked
in
batter
among
the
whitebait
and
the
dishes
being
seasoned
with
bliss
an
article
which
they
are
sometimes
out
of
at
greenwich
were
of
perfect
flavour
and
the
golden
drinks
had
been
bottled
in
the
golden
age
and
hoarding
up
their
sparkles
ever
since
the
best
of
it
was
that
bella
and
john
and
the
cherub
had
made
a
covenant
that
they
would
not
reveal
to
mortal
eyes
any
appearance
whatever
of
being
a
wedding
party
now
the
supervising
dignitary
the
archbishop
of
greenwich
knew
this
as
well
as
if
he
had
performed
the
nuptial
ceremony
and
the
loftiness
with
which
his
grace
entered
into
their
confidence
without
being
invited
and
insisted
on
a
show
of
keeping
the
waiters
out
of
it
was
the
crowning
glory
of
the
entertainment
there
was
an
innocent
young
waiter
of
a
slender
form
and
with
weakish
legs
as
yet
unversed
in
the
wiles
of
waiterhood
and
but
too
evidently
of
a
romantic
temperament
and
deeply
it
were
not
too
much
to
add
hopelessly
in
love
with
some
young
female
not
aware
of
his
merit
this
guileless
youth
descrying
the
position
of
affairs
which
even
his
innocence
could
not
mistake
limited
his
waiting
to
languishing
admiringly
against
the
sideboard
when
bella
did
want
anything
and
swooping
at
her
when
she
did
him
his
grace
the
archbishop
perpetually
obstructed
cutting
him
out
with
his
elbow
in
the
moment
of
success
despatching
him
in
degrading
quest
of
melted
butter
and
when
by
any
chance
he
got
hold
of
any
dish
worth
having
bereaving
him
of
it
and
ordering
him
to
stand
back
excuse
him
madam
said
the
archbishop
in
a
low
stately
voice
is
a
very
young
man
on
liking
and
we
do
like
him
this
induced
john
rokesmith
to
observe
by
way
of
making
the
thing
more
natural
my
love
this
is
so
much
more
successful
than
any
of
our
past
anniversaries
that
i
think
we
must
keep
our
future
anniversaries
here
whereunto
bella
replied
with
probably
the
least
successful
attempt
at
looking
matronly
that
ever
was
seen
i
think
so
john
dear
here
the
archbishop
of
greenwich
coughed
a
stately
cough
to
attract
the
attention
of
three
of
his
ministers
present
and
staring
at
them
seemed
to
say
call
upon
you
by
your
fealty
to
believe
this
with
his
own
hands
he
afterwards
put
on
the
dessert
as
remarking
to
the
three
guests
period
has
now
arrived
at
which
we
can
dispense
with
the
assistance
of
those
fellows
who
are
not
in
our
confidence
and
would
have
retired
with
complete
dignity
but
for
a
daring
action
issuing
from
the
misguided
brain
of
the
young
man
on
liking
he
finding
by
a
piece
of
orange
flower
somewhere
in
the
lobbies
now
approached
undetected
with
the
same
in
a
and
placed
it
on
bella
right
hand
the
archbishop
instantly
ejected
and
excommunicated
him
but
the
thing
was
done
trust
madam
said
his
grace
returning
alone
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
overlook
it
in
consideration
of
its
being
the
act
of
a
very
young
man
who
is
merely
here
on
liking
and
who
will
never
answer
with
that
he
solemnly
bowed
and
retired
and
they
all
burst
into
laughter
long
and
merry
is
of
no
use
said
bella
all
find
me
out
i
think
it
must
be
pa
and
john
dear
because
i
look
so
happy
her
husband
feeling
it
necessary
at
this
point
to
demand
one
of
those
mysterious
disappearances
on
bella
part
she
dutifully
obeyed
saying
in
a
softened
voice
from
her
place
of
concealment
remember
how
we
talked
about
the
ships
that
day
pa
my
dear
it
strange
now
to
think
that
there
was
no
john
in
all
the
ships
pa
at
all
my
dear
pa
not
at
all
my
dear
how
can
we
tell
what
coming
people
are
aboard
the
ships
that
may
be
sailing
to
us
now
from
the
unknown
seas
bella
remaining
invisible
and
silent
her
father
remained
at
his
dessert
and
wine
until
he
remembered
it
was
time
for
him
to
get
home
to
holloway
i
positively
can
not
tear
myself
away
he
cherubically
added
it
would
be
a
sin
without
drinking
to
many
many
happy
returns
of
this
most
happy
day
ten
thousand
times
cried
john
fill
my
glass
and
my
precious
wife
said
the
cherub
inaudibly
addressing
in
his
tendency
to
throw
his
feelings
into
the
form
of
a
speech
the
boys
down
below
who
were
bidding
against
each
other
to
put
their
heads
in
the
mud
for
sixpence
and
bella
and
john
you
will
readily
suppose
that
it
is
not
my
intention
to
trouble
you
with
many
observations
on
the
present
occasion
you
will
also
at
once
infer
the
nature
and
even
the
terms
of
the
toast
i
am
about
to
propose
on
the
present
occasion
gentlemen
and
bella
and
john
the
present
occasion
is
an
occasion
fraught
with
feelings
that
i
can
not
trust
myself
to
express
but
gentlemen
and
bella
and
john
for
the
part
i
have
had
in
it
for
the
confidence
you
have
placed
in
me
and
for
the
affectionate
and
kindness
with
which
you
have
determined
not
to
find
me
in
the
way
when
i
am
well
aware
that
i
can
not
be
otherwise
than
in
it
more
or
less
i
do
most
heartily
thank
you
gentlemen
and
bella
and
john
my
love
to
you
and
may
we
meet
as
on
the
present
occasion
on
many
future
occasions
that
is
to
say
gentlemen
and
bella
and
john
on
many
happy
returns
of
the
present
happy
occasion
having
thus
concluded
his
address
the
amiable
cherub
embraced
his
daughter
and
took
his
flight
to
the
steamboat
which
was
to
convey
him
to
london
and
was
then
lying
at
the
floating
pier
doing
its
best
to
bump
the
same
to
bits
but
the
happy
couple
were
not
going
to
part
with
him
in
that
way
and
before
he
had
been
on
board
two
minutes
there
they
were
looking
down
at
him
from
the
wharf
above
dear
cried
bella
beckoning
him
with
her
parasol
to
approach
the
side
and
bending
gracefully
to
whisper
my
darling
i
beat
you
much
with
that
horrid
little
bonnet
pa
to
speak
of
my
dear
i
pinch
your
legs
pa
nicely
my
pet
are
sure
you
quite
forgive
me
pa
please
pa
please
forgive
me
quite
half
laughing
at
him
and
half
crying
to
him
bella
besought
him
in
the
prettiest
manner
in
a
manner
so
engaging
and
so
playful
and
so
natural
that
her
cherubic
parent
made
a
coaxing
face
as
if
she
had
never
grown
up
and
said
a
silly
little
mouse
it
is
you
do
forgive
me
that
and
everything
else
do
you
pa
my
dearest
you
do
feel
solitary
or
neglected
going
away
by
yourself
do
you
pa
bless
you
no
my
life
dearest
pa
my
darling
take
her
away
my
dear
john
take
her
home
so
she
leaning
on
her
husband
arm
they
turned
homeward
by
a
rosy
path
which
the
gracious
sun
struck
out
for
them
in
its
setting
and
o
there
are
days
in
this
life
worth
life
and
worth
death
and
o
what
a
bright
old
song
it
is
that
o
is
love
is
love
is
love
that
makes
the
world
go
round
chapter
concerning
the
mendicant
bride
the
impressive
gloom
with
which
mrs
wilfer
received
her
husband
on
his
return
from
the
wedding
knocked
so
hard
at
the
door
of
the
cherubic
conscience
and
likewise
so
impaired
the
firmness
of
the
cherubic
legs
that
the
culprit
tottering
condition
of
mind
and
body
might
have
roused
suspicion
in
less
occupied
persons
that
the
grimly
heroic
lady
miss
lavinia
and
that
esteemed
friend
of
the
family
mr
george
sampson
but
the
attention
of
all
three
being
fully
possessed
by
the
main
fact
of
the
marriage
they
had
happily
none
to
bestow
on
the
guilty
conspirator
to
which
fortunate
circumstance
he
owed
the
escape
for
which
he
was
in
nowise
indebted
to
himself
do
not
said
mrs
wilfer
from
her
stately
corner
for
your
daughter
bella
be
sure
my
dear
he
returned
with
a
most
flagrant
assumption
of
unconsciousness
did
omit
it
how
or
perhaps
i
should
rather
say
where
is
bella
here
mrs
wilfer
proclaimed
with
folded
arms
the
cherub
faintly
muttered
something
to
the
abortive
effect
of
indeed
my
dear
here
repeated
mrs
wilfer
in
a
stern
sonorous
voice
a
word
you
have
no
daughter
bella
daughter
bella
my
dear
your
daughter
bella
said
mrs
wilfer
with
a
lofty
air
of
never
having
had
the
least
copartnership
in
that
young
lady
of
whom
she
now
made
reproachful
mention
as
an
article
of
luxury
which
her
husband
had
set
up
entirely
on
his
own
account
and
in
direct
opposition
to
her
advice
your
daughter
bella
has
bestowed
herself
upon
a
mendicant
gracious
my
dear
your
father
his
daughter
bella
letter
lavinia
said
mrs
wilfer
in
her
monotonous
act
of
parliament
tone
and
waving
her
hand
think
your
father
will
admit
it
to
be
documentary
proof
of
what
i
tell
him
i
believe
your
father
is
acquainted
with
his
daughter
writing
but
i
do
not
know
he
may
tell
you
he
is
not
nothing
will
surprise
me
at
greenwich
and
dated
this
morning
said
the
irrepressible
flouncing
at
her
father
in
handing
him
the
evidence
ma
wo
be
angry
but
is
happily
married
to
mr
john
rokesmith
and
did
mention
it
beforehand
to
avoid
words
and
please
tell
darling
you
and
love
to
me
and
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
have
said
if
any
other
unmarried
member
of
the
family
had
done
it
he
read
the
letter
and
faintly
exclaimed
me
may
well
say
dear
me
rejoined
mrs
wilfer
in
a
deep
tone
upon
which
encouragement
he
said
it
again
though
scarcely
with
the
success
he
had
expected
for
the
scornful
lady
then
remarked
with
extreme
bitterness
said
that
before
very
surprising
but
i
suppose
my
dear
hinted
the
cherub
as
he
folded
the
letter
after
a
disconcerting
silence
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
would
you
object
to
my
pointing
out
my
dear
that
mr
john
rokesmith
is
not
so
far
as
i
am
acquainted
with
him
strictly
speaking
a
mendicant
returned
mrs
wilfer
with
an
awful
air
of
politeness
so
i
was
not
aware
that
mr
john
rokesmith
was
a
gentleman
of
landed
property
but
i
am
much
relieved
to
hear
it
doubt
if
you
have
heard
it
my
dear
the
cherub
submitted
with
hesitation
you
said
mrs
wilfer
make
false
statements
it
appears
so
be
it
if
my
daughter
flies
in
my
face
surely
my
husband
may
the
one
thing
is
not
more
unnatural
than
the
other
there
seems
a
fitness
in
the
arrangement
by
all
means
assuming
with
a
shiver
of
resignation
a
deadly
cheerfulness
but
here
the
irrepressible
skirmished
into
the
conflict
dragging
the
reluctant
form
of
mr
sampson
after
her
interposed
the
young
lady
must
say
i
think
it
would
be
much
better
if
you
would
keep
to
the
point
and
not
hold
forth
about
people
flying
into
people
faces
which
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
impossible
nonsense
exclaimed
mrs
wilfer
knitting
her
dark
brows
nonsense
ma
returned
lavvy
george
sampson
knows
it
is
as
well
as
i
do
mrs
wilfer
suddenly
becoming
petrified
fixed
her
indignant
eyes
upon
the
wretched
george
who
divided
between
the
support
due
from
him
to
his
love
and
the
support
due
from
him
to
his
love
mamma
supported
nobody
not
even
himself
true
point
is
pursued
lavinia
bella
has
behaved
in
a
most
unsisterly
way
to
me
and
might
have
severely
compromised
me
with
george
and
with
george
family
by
making
off
and
getting
married
in
this
very
low
and
disreputable
manner
with
some
or
other
i
suppose
for
a
bridesmaid
when
she
ought
to
have
confided
in
me
and
ought
to
have
said
if
lavvy
you
consider
it
due
to
your
engagement
with
george
that
you
should
countenance
the
occasion
by
being
present
then
lavvy
i
beg
you
to
be
present
keeping
my
secret
from
ma
and
as
of
course
i
should
have
done
of
course
you
would
have
done
ingrate
exclaimed
mrs
wilfer
say
you
know
upon
my
honour
you
must
mr
sampson
remonstrated
shaking
his
head
seriously
the
highest
respect
for
you
upon
my
life
you
must
no
really
you
know
when
a
man
with
the
feelings
of
a
gentleman
finds
himself
engaged
to
a
young
lady
and
it
comes
even
on
the
part
of
a
member
of
the
family
to
vipers
you
know
i
would
merely
put
it
to
your
own
good
feeling
you
know
said
mr
sampson
in
rather
lame
conclusion
mrs
wilfer
baleful
stare
at
the
young
gentleman
in
acknowledgment
of
his
obliging
interference
was
of
such
a
nature
that
miss
lavinia
burst
into
tears
and
caught
him
round
the
neck
for
his
protection
own
unnatural
mother
screamed
the
young
lady
to
annihilate
george
but
you
sha
be
annihilated
george
i
die
first
mr
sampson
in
the
arms
of
his
mistress
still
struggled
to
shake
his
head
at
mrs
wilfer
and
to
remark
every
sentiment
of
respect
for
you
you
know
vipers
really
does
do
you
credit
shall
not
be
annihilated
george
cried
miss
lavinia
shall
destroy
me
first
and
then
she
be
contented
oh
oh
oh
have
i
lured
george
from
his
happy
home
to
expose
him
to
this
george
dear
be
free
leave
me
ever
dearest
george
to
ma
and
to
my
fate
give
my
love
to
your
aunt
george
dear
and
implore
her
not
to
curse
the
viper
that
has
crossed
your
path
and
blighted
your
existence
oh
oh
oh
the
young
lady
who
hysterically
speaking
was
only
just
come
of
age
and
had
never
gone
off
yet
here
fell
into
a
highly
creditable
crisis
which
regarded
as
a
first
performance
was
very
successful
mr
sampson
bending
over
the
body
meanwhile
in
a
state
of
distraction
which
induced
him
to
address
mrs
wilfer
in
the
inconsistent
expressions
with
the
highest
respect
for
you
behold
your
work
the
cherub
stood
helplessly
rubbing
his
chin
and
looking
on
but
on
the
whole
was
inclined
to
welcome
this
diversion
as
one
in
which
by
reason
of
the
absorbent
properties
of
hysterics
the
previous
question
would
become
absorbed
and
so
indeed
it
proved
for
the
irrepressible
gradually
coming
to
herself
and
asking
with
wild
emotion
dear
are
you
safe
and
further
love
what
has
happened
where
is
ma
mr
sampson
with
words
of
comfort
raised
her
prostrate
form
and
handed
her
to
mrs
wilfer
as
if
the
young
lady
were
something
in
the
nature
of
refreshments
mrs
wilfer
with
dignity
partaking
of
the
refreshments
by
kissing
her
once
on
the
brow
as
if
accepting
an
oyster
miss
lavvy
tottering
returned
to
the
protection
of
mr
sampson
to
whom
she
said
dear
i
am
afraid
i
have
been
foolish
but
i
am
still
a
little
weak
and
giddy
do
let
go
my
hand
george
and
whom
she
afterwards
greatly
agitated
at
intervals
by
giving
utterance
when
least
expected
to
a
sound
between
a
sob
and
a
bottle
of
soda
water
that
seemed
to
rend
the
bosom
of
her
frock
among
the
most
remarkable
effects
of
this
crisis
may
be
mentioned
its
having
when
peace
was
restored
an
inexplicable
moral
influence
of
an
elevating
kind
on
miss
lavinia
mrs
wilfer
and
mr
george
sampson
from
which
was
altogether
excluded
as
an
outsider
and
miss
lavinia
assumed
a
modest
air
of
having
distinguished
herself
mrs
wilfer
a
serene
air
of
forgiveness
and
resignation
mr
sampson
an
air
of
having
been
improved
and
chastened
the
influence
pervaded
the
spirit
in
which
they
returned
to
the
previous
question
dear
said
lavvy
with
a
melancholy
smile
what
has
passed
i
am
sure
ma
will
tell
pa
that
he
may
tell
bella
we
shall
all
be
glad
to
see
her
and
her
husband
mr
sampson
said
he
was
sure
of
it
too
murmuring
how
eminently
he
respected
mrs
wilfer
and
ever
must
and
ever
would
never
more
eminently
he
added
than
after
what
had
passed
be
it
from
me
said
mrs
wilfer
making
deep
proclamation
from
her
corner
run
counter
to
the
feelings
of
a
child
of
mine
and
of
a
youth
mr
sampson
hardly
seemed
to
like
that
word
is
the
object
of
her
maiden
preference
i
may
feel
nay
know
that
i
have
been
deluded
and
deceived
i
may
feel
nay
know
that
i
have
been
set
aside
and
passed
over
i
may
feel
nay
know
that
after
having
so
far
overcome
my
repugnance
towards
mr
and
mrs
boffin
as
to
receive
them
under
this
roof
and
to
consent
to
your
daughter
bella
here
turning
to
her
husband
under
theirs
it
were
well
if
your
daughter
bella
again
turning
to
her
husband
profited
in
a
worldly
point
of
view
by
a
connection
so
distasteful
so
disreputable
i
may
feel
nay
know
that
in
uniting
herself
to
mr
rokesmith
she
has
united
herself
to
one
who
is
in
spite
of
shallow
sophistry
a
mendicant
and
i
may
feel
well
assured
that
your
daughter
bella
again
turning
to
her
husband
not
exalt
her
family
by
becoming
a
mendicant
bride
but
i
suppress
what
i
feel
and
say
nothing
of
it
mr
sampson
murmured
that
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
you
might
expect
from
one
who
had
ever
in
her
own
family
been
an
example
and
never
an
outrage
and
ever
more
so
mr
sampson
added
with
some
degree
of
obscurity
and
never
more
so
than
in
and
through
what
had
passed
he
must
take
the
liberty
of
adding
that
what
was
true
of
the
mother
was
true
of
the
youngest
daughter
and
that
he
could
never
forget
the
touching
feelings
that
the
conduct
of
both
had
awakened
within
him
in
conclusion
he
did
hope
that
there
was
a
man
with
a
beating
heart
who
was
capable
of
something
that
remained
undescribed
in
consequence
of
miss
lavinia
stopping
him
as
he
reeled
in
his
speech
said
mrs
wilfer
resuming
her
discourse
and
turning
to
her
lord
again
your
daughter
bella
come
when
she
will
and
she
will
be
received
so
after
a
short
pause
and
an
air
of
having
taken
medicine
in
it
will
her
husband
i
beg
pa
said
lavinia
you
will
not
tell
bella
what
i
have
undergone
it
can
do
no
good
and
it
might
cause
her
to
reproach
herself
dearest
girl
urged
mr
sampson
ought
to
know
it
george
said
lavinia
in
a
tone
of
resolute
dearest
george
let
it
be
buried
in
oblivion
mr
sampson
considered
that
noble
is
too
noble
dearest
george
returned
lavinia
pa
i
hope
you
will
be
careful
not
to
refer
before
bella
if
you
can
help
it
to
my
engagement
to
george
it
might
seem
like
reminding
her
of
her
having
cast
herself
away
and
i
hope
pa
that
you
will
think
it
equally
right
to
avoid
mentioning
george
rising
prospects
when
bella
is
present
it
might
seem
like
taunting
her
with
her
own
poor
fortunes
let
me
ever
remember
that
i
am
her
younger
sister
and
ever
spare
her
painful
contrasts
which
could
not
but
wound
her
sharply
mr
sampson
expressed
his
belief
that
such
was
the
demeanour
of
angels
miss
lavvy
replied
with
solemnity
dearest
george
i
am
but
too
well
aware
that
i
am
merely
human
mrs
wilfer
for
her
part
still
further
improved
the
occasion
by
sitting
with
her
eyes
fastened
on
her
husband
like
two
great
black
notes
of
interrogation
severely
inquiring
are
you
looking
into
your
breast
do
you
deserve
your
blessings
can
you
lay
your
hand
upon
your
heart
and
say
that
you
are
worthy
of
so
hysterical
a
daughter
i
do
not
ask
you
if
you
are
worthy
of
such
a
wife
put
me
out
of
the
question
but
are
you
sufficiently
conscious
of
and
thankful
for
the
pervading
moral
grandeur
of
the
family
spectacle
on
which
you
are
gazing
these
inquiries
proved
very
harassing
to
who
besides
being
a
little
disturbed
by
wine
was
in
perpetual
terror
of
committing
himself
by
the
utterance
of
stray
words
that
would
betray
his
guilty
foreknowledge
however
the
scene
being
over
and
all
things
considered
well
over
he
sought
refuge
in
a
doze
which
gave
his
lady
immense
offence
you
think
of
your
daughter
bella
and
sleep
she
disdainfully
inquired
to
which
he
mildly
answered
i
think
i
can
my
dear
said
mrs
wilfer
with
solemn
indignation
would
recommend
you
if
you
have
a
human
feeling
to
retire
to
bed
you
my
dear
he
replied
think
it
is
the
best
place
for
me
and
with
these
unsympathetic
words
very
gladly
withdrew
within
a
few
weeks
afterwards
the
mendicant
bride
with
the
mendicant
came
to
tea
in
fulfilment
of
an
engagement
made
through
her
father
and
the
way
in
which
the
mendicant
bride
dashed
at
the
unassailable
position
so
considerately
to
be
held
by
miss
lavy
and
scattered
the
whole
of
the
works
in
all
directions
in
a
moment
was
triumphant
ma
cried
bella
running
into
the
room
with
a
radiant
face
do
you
do
dearest
ma
and
then
embraced
her
joyously
lavvy
darling
how
do
you
do
and
how
george
sampson
and
how
is
he
getting
on
and
when
are
you
going
to
be
married
and
how
rich
are
you
going
to
grow
you
must
tell
me
all
about
it
lavvy
dear
immediately
john
love
kiss
ma
and
lavvy
and
then
we
shall
all
be
at
home
and
comfortable
mrs
wilfer
stared
but
was
helpless
miss
lavinia
stared
but
was
helpless
apparently
with
no
compunction
and
assuredly
with
no
ceremony
bella
tossed
her
bonnet
away
and
sat
down
to
make
the
tea
ma
and
lavvy
you
both
take
sugar
i
know
and
pa
you
good
little
pa
you
do
take
milk
john
does
i
did
before
i
was
married
but
i
do
now
because
john
does
john
dear
did
you
kiss
ma
and
lavvy
oh
you
did
quite
correct
john
dear
but
i
did
see
you
do
it
so
i
asked
cut
some
bread
and
butter
john
that
a
love
ma
likes
it
doubled
and
now
you
must
tell
me
dearest
ma
and
lavvy
upon
your
words
and
honours
did
you
for
a
moment
just
a
moment
think
i
was
a
dreadful
little
wretch
when
i
wrote
to
say
i
had
run
away
before
mrs
wilfer
could
wave
her
gloves
the
mendicant
bride
in
her
merriest
affectionate
manner
went
on
again
think
it
must
have
made
you
rather
cross
dear
ma
and
lavvy
and
i
know
i
deserved
that
you
should
be
very
cross
but
you
see
i
had
been
such
a
heedless
heartless
creature
and
had
led
you
so
to
expect
that
i
should
marry
for
money
and
so
to
make
sure
that
i
was
incapable
of
marrying
for
love
that
i
thought
you
could
believe
me
because
you
see
you
did
know
how
much
of
good
good
good
i
had
learnt
from
john
well
so
i
was
sly
about
it
and
ashamed
of
what
you
supposed
me
to
be
and
fearful
that
we
could
understand
one
another
and
might
come
to
words
which
we
should
all
be
sorry
for
afterwards
and
so
i
said
to
john
that
if
he
liked
to
take
me
without
any
fuss
he
might
and
as
he
did
like
i
let
him
and
we
were
married
at
greenwich
church
in
the
presence
of
nobody
except
an
unknown
individual
who
dropped
in
here
her
eyes
sparkled
more
brightly
half
a
pensioner
and
now
is
it
nice
dearest
ma
and
lavvy
to
know
that
no
words
have
been
said
which
any
of
us
can
be
sorry
for
and
that
we
are
all
the
best
of
friends
at
the
pleasantest
of
teas
having
got
up
and
kissed
them
again
she
slipped
back
to
her
chair
after
a
loop
on
the
road
to
squeeze
her
husband
round
the
neck
and
again
went
on
now
you
will
naturally
want
to
know
dearest
ma
and
lavvy
how
we
live
and
what
we
have
got
to
live
upon
well
and
so
we
live
on
blackheath
in
the
charm
ingest
of
dolls
houses
de
lightfully
furnished
and
we
have
a
clever
little
servant
who
is
de
cidedly
pretty
and
we
are
economical
and
orderly
and
do
everything
by
clockwork
and
we
have
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
and
we
have
all
we
want
and
more
and
lastly
if
you
would
like
to
know
in
confidence
as
perhaps
you
may
what
is
my
opinion
of
my
husband
my
opinion
is
that
i
almost
love
him
if
you
would
like
to
know
in
confidence
as
perhaps
you
may
said
her
husband
smiling
as
he
stood
by
her
side
without
her
having
detected
his
approach
opinion
of
my
wife
my
opinion
is
but
bella
started
up
and
put
her
hand
upon
his
lips
sir
no
john
dear
seriously
please
not
yet
a
while
i
want
to
be
something
so
much
worthier
than
the
doll
in
the
doll
house
darling
are
you
not
half
not
a
quarter
so
much
worthier
as
i
hope
you
may
some
day
find
me
try
me
through
some
reverse
john
try
me
through
some
trial
and
tell
them
after
that
what
you
think
of
me
will
my
life
said
john
promise
it
my
dear
john
and
you
wo
speak
a
word
now
will
you
i
wo
said
john
with
a
very
expressive
look
of
admiration
around
him
a
word
now
she
laid
her
laughing
cheek
upon
his
breast
to
thank
him
and
said
looking
at
the
rest
of
them
sideways
out
of
her
bright
eyes
go
further
pa
and
ma
and
lavvy
john
do
suspect
it
he
has
no
idea
of
it
but
i
quite
love
him
even
mrs
wilfer
relaxed
under
the
influence
of
her
married
daughter
and
seemed
in
a
majestic
manner
to
imply
remotely
that
if
had
been
a
more
deserving
object
she
too
might
have
condescended
to
come
down
from
her
pedestal
for
his
beguilement
miss
lavinia
on
the
other
hand
had
strong
doubts
of
the
policy
of
the
course
of
treatment
and
whether
it
might
not
spoil
mr
sampson
if
experimented
on
in
the
case
of
that
young
gentleman
himself
was
for
his
part
convinced
that
he
was
father
of
one
of
the
most
charming
of
girls
and
that
rokesmith
was
the
most
favoured
of
men
which
opinion
if
propounded
to
him
rokesmith
would
probably
not
have
contested
the
pair
left
early
so
that
they
might
walk
at
leisure
to
their
from
london
for
greenwich
at
first
they
were
very
cheerful
and
talked
much
but
after
a
while
bella
fancied
that
her
husband
was
turning
somewhat
thoughtful
so
she
asked
him
dear
what
the
matter
my
love
you
tell
me
said
bella
looking
up
into
his
face
you
are
thinking
of
not
much
in
the
thought
my
soul
i
was
thinking
whether
you
would
like
me
to
be
rich
rich
john
repeated
bella
shrinking
a
little
mean
really
rich
say
as
rich
as
mr
boffin
you
would
like
that
should
be
almost
afraid
to
try
john
dear
was
he
much
the
better
for
his
wealth
was
i
much
the
better
for
the
little
part
i
once
had
in
it
all
people
are
not
the
worse
for
riches
my
own
people
bella
musingly
suggested
with
raised
eyebrows
even
most
people
it
may
be
hoped
if
you
were
rich
for
instance
you
would
have
a
great
power
of
doing
good
to
others
sir
for
instance
bella
playfully
rejoined
should
i
exercise
the
power
for
instance
and
again
sir
for
instance
should
i
at
the
same
time
have
a
great
power
of
doing
harm
to
myself
laughing
and
pressing
her
arm
he
retorted
still
again
for
instance
would
you
exercise
that
power
do
know
said
bella
thoughtfully
shaking
her
head
hope
not
i
think
not
but
it
so
easy
to
hope
not
and
think
not
without
the
riches
do
you
say
my
darling
instead
of
that
phrase
being
poor
he
asked
looking
earnestly
at
her
do
i
say
being
poor
because
i
am
not
poor
dear
john
it
not
possible
that
you
suppose
i
think
we
are
poor
do
my
love
john
me
sweetheart
i
know
that
i
am
rich
beyond
all
wealth
in
having
you
but
i
think
of
you
and
think
for
you
in
such
a
dress
as
you
are
wearing
now
you
first
charmed
me
and
in
no
dress
could
you
ever
look
to
my
thinking
more
graceful
or
more
beautiful
but
you
have
admired
many
finer
dresses
this
very
day
and
is
it
not
natural
that
i
wish
i
could
give
them
to
you
very
nice
that
you
should
wish
it
john
it
brings
these
tears
of
grateful
pleasure
into
my
eyes
to
hear
you
say
so
with
such
tenderness
but
i
do
want
them
he
pursued
are
now
walking
through
the
muddy
streets
i
love
those
pretty
feet
so
dearly
that
i
feel
as
if
i
could
not
bear
the
dirt
to
soil
the
sole
of
your
shoe
is
it
not
natural
that
i
wish
you
could
ride
in
a
carriage
very
nice
said
bella
glancing
downward
at
the
feet
in
question
know
that
you
admire
them
so
much
john
dear
and
since
you
do
i
am
sorry
that
these
shoes
are
a
full
size
too
large
but
i
do
want
a
carriage
believe
me
would
like
one
if
you
could
have
one
bella
should
like
it
for
its
own
sake
half
so
well
as
such
a
wish
for
it
dear
john
your
wishes
are
as
real
to
me
as
the
wishes
in
the
fairy
story
that
were
all
fulfilled
as
soon
as
spoken
wish
me
everything
that
you
can
wish
for
the
woman
you
dearly
love
and
i
have
as
good
as
got
it
john
i
have
better
than
got
it
john
they
were
not
the
less
happy
for
such
talk
and
home
was
not
the
less
home
for
coming
after
it
bella
was
fast
developing
a
perfect
genius
for
home
all
the
loves
and
graces
seemed
her
husband
thought
to
have
taken
domestic
service
with
her
and
to
help
her
to
make
home
engaging
her
married
life
glided
happily
on
she
was
alone
all
day
for
after
an
early
breakfast
her
husband
repaired
every
morning
to
the
city
and
did
not
return
until
their
late
dinner
hour
he
was
a
china
house
he
explained
to
bella
which
she
found
quite
satisfactory
without
pursuing
the
china
house
into
minuter
details
than
a
wholesale
vision
of
tea
rice
silks
carved
boxes
and
people
in
more
than
shoes
with
their
pigtails
pulling
their
heads
of
hair
off
painted
on
transparent
porcelain
she
always
walked
with
her
husband
to
the
railroad
and
was
always
there
again
to
meet
him
her
old
coquettish
ways
a
little
sobered
down
but
not
much
and
her
dress
as
daintily
managed
as
if
she
managed
nothing
else
but
john
gone
to
business
and
bella
returned
home
the
dress
would
be
laid
aside
trim
little
wrappers
and
aprons
would
be
substituted
and
bella
putting
back
her
hair
with
both
hands
as
if
she
were
making
the
most
arrangements
for
going
dramatically
distracted
would
enter
on
the
household
affairs
of
the
day
such
weighing
and
mixing
and
chopping
and
grating
such
dusting
and
washing
and
polishing
such
snipping
and
weeding
and
trowelling
and
other
small
gardening
such
making
and
mending
and
folding
and
airing
such
diverse
arrangements
and
above
all
such
severe
study
for
mrs
who
had
never
been
wont
to
do
too
much
at
home
as
miss
was
under
the
constant
necessity
of
referring
for
advice
and
support
to
a
sage
volume
entitled
the
complete
british
family
housewife
which
she
would
sit
consulting
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
her
temples
on
her
hands
like
some
perplexed
enchantress
poring
over
the
black
art
this
principally
because
the
complete
british
housewife
however
sound
a
briton
at
heart
was
by
no
means
an
expert
briton
at
expressing
herself
with
clearness
in
the
british
tongue
and
sometimes
might
have
issued
her
directions
to
equal
purpose
in
the
kamskatchan
language
in
any
crisis
of
this
nature
bella
would
suddenly
exclaim
aloud
you
ridiculous
old
thing
what
do
you
mean
by
that
you
must
have
been
drinking
and
having
made
this
marginal
note
would
try
the
housewife
again
with
all
her
dimples
screwed
into
an
expression
of
profound
research
there
was
likewise
a
coolness
on
the
part
of
the
british
housewife
which
mrs
john
rokesmith
found
highly
exasperating
she
would
say
a
salamander
as
if
a
general
should
command
a
private
to
catch
a
tartar
or
she
would
casually
issue
the
order
in
a
handful
of
something
entirely
unattainable
in
these
the
housewife
most
glaring
moments
of
unreason
bella
would
shut
her
up
and
knock
her
on
the
table
apostrophising
her
with
the
compliment
you
are
a
stupid
old
donkey
where
am
i
to
get
it
do
you
think
another
branch
of
study
claimed
the
attention
of
mrs
john
rokesmith
for
a
regular
period
every
day
this
was
the
mastering
of
the
newspaper
so
that
she
might
be
close
up
with
john
on
general
topics
when
john
came
home
in
her
desire
to
be
in
all
things
his
companion
she
would
have
set
herself
with
equal
zeal
to
master
algebra
or
euclid
if
he
had
divided
his
soul
between
her
and
either
wonderful
was
the
way
in
which
she
would
store
up
the
city
intelligence
and
beamingly
shed
it
upon
john
in
the
course
of
the
evening
incidentally
mentioning
the
commodities
that
were
looking
up
in
the
markets
and
how
much
gold
had
been
taken
to
the
bank
and
trying
to
look
wise
and
serious
over
it
until
she
would
laugh
at
herself
most
charmingly
and
would
say
kissing
him
all
comes
of
my
love
john
dear
for
a
city
man
john
certainly
did
appear
to
care
as
little
as
might
be
for
the
looking
up
or
looking
down
of
things
as
well
as
for
the
gold
that
got
taken
to
the
bank
but
he
cared
beyond
all
expression
for
his
wife
as
a
most
precious
and
sweet
commodity
that
was
always
looking
up
and
that
never
was
worth
less
than
all
the
gold
in
the
world
and
she
being
inspired
by
her
affection
and
having
a
quick
wit
and
a
fine
ready
instinct
made
amazing
progress
in
her
domestic
efficiency
though
as
an
endearing
creature
she
made
no
progress
at
all
this
was
her
husband
verdict
and
he
justified
it
by
telling
her
that
she
had
begun
her
married
life
as
the
most
endearing
creature
that
could
possibly
be
you
have
such
a
cheerful
spirit
he
said
fondly
are
like
a
bright
light
in
the
house
i
truly
john
you
truly
yes
indeed
only
much
more
and
much
better
you
know
john
dear
said
bella
taking
him
by
a
button
of
his
coat
i
sometimes
at
odd
moments
do
laugh
john
please
nothing
should
induce
john
to
do
it
when
she
asked
him
not
to
do
that
i
sometimes
think
john
i
feel
a
little
serious
you
too
much
alone
my
darling
dear
no
john
the
time
is
so
short
that
i
have
not
a
moment
too
much
in
the
week
serious
my
life
then
when
serious
i
laugh
i
think
said
bella
laughing
as
she
laid
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
would
believe
sir
that
i
feel
serious
now
but
i
do
and
she
laughed
again
and
something
glistened
in
her
eyes
you
like
to
be
rich
pet
he
asked
her
coaxingly
john
how
can
you
ask
such
goose
questions
you
regret
anything
my
love
anything
no
bella
confidently
answered
but
then
suddenly
changing
she
said
between
laughing
and
glistening
yes
i
do
though
i
regret
mrs
boffin
too
regret
that
separation
very
much
but
perhaps
it
is
only
temporary
perhaps
things
may
so
fall
out
as
that
you
may
sometimes
see
her
again
as
that
we
may
sometimes
see
her
again
bella
might
be
very
anxious
on
the
subject
but
she
scarcely
seemed
so
at
the
moment
with
an
absent
air
she
was
investigating
that
button
on
her
husband
coat
when
pa
came
in
to
spend
the
evening
pa
had
his
special
chair
and
his
special
corner
reserved
for
him
on
all
occasions
and
without
disparagement
of
his
domestic
joys
was
far
happier
there
than
anywhere
it
was
always
pleasantly
droll
to
see
pa
and
bella
together
but
on
this
present
evening
her
husband
thought
her
more
than
usually
fantastic
with
him
are
a
very
good
little
boy
said
bella
come
unexpectedly
as
soon
as
you
could
get
out
of
school
and
how
have
they
used
you
at
school
you
dear
my
pet
replied
the
cherub
smiling
and
rubbing
his
hands
as
she
sat
him
down
in
his
chair
attend
two
schools
there
the
mincing
lane
establishment
and
there
your
mother
academy
which
might
you
mean
my
dear
said
bella
eh
why
to
say
the
truth
both
have
taken
a
little
out
of
me
my
dear
but
that
was
to
be
expected
there
no
royal
road
to
learning
and
what
is
life
but
learning
what
do
you
do
with
yourself
when
you
have
got
your
learning
by
heart
you
silly
child
then
my
dear
said
the
cherub
after
a
little
consideration
suppose
i
die
are
a
very
bad
boy
retorted
bella
talk
about
dismal
things
and
be
out
of
spirits
bella
rejoined
her
father
am
not
out
of
spirits
i
am
as
gay
as
a
lark
which
his
face
confirmed
if
you
are
sure
and
certain
it
not
you
i
suppose
it
must
be
i
said
bella
i
wo
do
so
any
more
john
dear
we
must
give
this
little
fellow
his
supper
you
know
course
we
must
my
darling
has
been
grubbing
and
grubbing
at
school
said
bella
looking
at
her
father
hand
and
lightly
slapping
it
he
not
fit
to
be
seen
o
what
a
grubby
child
my
dear
said
her
father
was
going
to
ask
to
be
allowed
to
wash
my
hands
only
you
find
me
out
so
soon
here
sir
cried
bella
taking
him
by
the
front
of
his
coat
here
and
be
washed
directly
you
are
not
to
be
trusted
to
do
it
for
yourself
come
here
sir
the
cherub
to
his
genial
amusement
was
accordingly
conducted
to
a
little
where
bella
soaped
his
face
and
rubbed
his
face
and
soaped
his
hands
and
rubbed
his
hands
and
splashed
him
and
rinsed
him
and
towelled
him
until
he
was
as
red
as
even
to
his
very
ears
you
must
be
brushed
and
combed
sir
said
bella
busily
the
light
john
shut
your
eyes
sir
and
let
me
take
hold
of
your
chin
be
good
directly
and
do
as
you
are
told
her
father
being
more
than
willing
to
obey
she
dressed
his
hair
in
her
most
elaborate
manner
brushing
it
out
straight
parting
it
winding
it
over
her
fingers
sticking
it
up
on
end
and
constantly
falling
back
on
john
to
get
a
good
look
at
the
effect
of
it
who
always
received
her
on
his
disengaged
arm
and
detained
her
while
the
patient
cherub
stood
waiting
to
be
finished
said
bella
when
she
had
at
last
completed
the
final
touches
you
are
something
like
a
genteel
boy
put
your
jacket
on
and
come
and
have
your
supper
the
cherub
investing
himself
with
his
coat
was
led
back
to
his
corner
where
but
for
having
no
egotism
in
his
pleasant
nature
he
would
have
answered
well
enough
for
that
radiant
though
boy
jack
horner
bella
with
her
own
hands
laid
a
cloth
for
him
and
brought
him
his
supper
on
a
tray
a
moment
said
she
must
keep
his
little
clothes
clean
and
tied
a
napkin
under
his
chin
in
a
very
methodical
manner
while
he
took
his
supper
bella
sat
by
him
sometimes
admonishing
him
to
hold
his
fork
by
the
handle
like
a
polite
child
and
at
other
times
carving
for
him
or
pouring
out
his
drink
fantastic
as
it
all
was
and
accustomed
as
she
ever
had
been
to
make
a
plaything
of
her
good
father
ever
delighted
that
she
should
put
him
to
that
account
still
there
was
an
occasional
something
on
bella
part
that
was
new
it
could
not
be
said
that
she
was
less
playful
whimsical
or
natural
than
she
always
had
been
but
it
seemed
her
husband
thought
as
if
there
were
some
rather
graver
reason
than
he
had
supposed
for
what
she
had
so
lately
said
and
as
if
throughout
all
this
there
were
glimpses
of
an
underlying
seriousness
it
was
a
circumstance
in
support
of
this
view
of
the
case
that
when
she
had
lighted
her
father
pipe
and
mixed
him
his
glass
of
grog
she
sat
down
on
a
stool
between
her
father
and
her
husband
leaning
her
arm
upon
the
latter
and
was
very
quiet
so
quiet
that
when
her
father
rose
to
take
his
leave
she
looked
round
with
a
start
as
if
she
had
forgotten
his
being
there
go
a
little
way
with
pa
john
my
dear
do
you
have
not
written
to
lizzie
hexam
since
i
wrote
and
told
her
that
i
really
had
a
lover
a
whole
one
i
have
often
thought
i
would
like
to
tell
her
how
right
she
was
when
she
pretended
to
read
in
the
live
coals
that
i
would
go
through
fire
and
water
for
him
i
am
in
the
humour
to
tell
her
so
john
and
i
stay
at
home
and
do
it
are
tired
at
all
tired
john
dear
but
in
the
humour
to
write
to
lizzie
good
night
dear
good
night
you
dear
good
gentle
pa
left
to
herself
she
sat
down
to
write
and
wrote
lizzie
a
long
letter
she
had
but
completed
it
and
read
it
over
when
her
husband
came
back
are
just
in
time
sir
said
bella
am
going
to
give
you
your
first
curtain
lecture
it
shall
be
a
lecture
you
shall
take
this
chair
of
mine
when
i
have
folded
my
letter
and
i
will
take
the
stool
though
you
ought
to
take
it
i
can
tell
you
sir
if
the
stool
of
repentance
and
you
soon
find
yourself
taken
to
task
soundly
her
letter
folded
sealed
and
directed
and
her
pen
wiped
and
her
middle
finger
wiped
and
her
desk
locked
up
and
put
away
and
these
transactions
performed
with
an
air
of
severe
business
sedateness
which
the
complete
british
housewife
might
have
assumed
and
certainly
would
not
have
rounded
off
and
broken
down
in
with
a
musical
laugh
as
bella
did
she
placed
her
husband
in
his
chair
and
placed
herself
upon
her
stool
sir
to
begin
at
the
beginning
what
is
your
name
a
question
more
decidedly
rushing
at
the
secret
he
was
keeping
from
her
could
not
have
astounded
him
but
he
kept
his
countenance
and
his
secret
and
answered
rokesmith
my
dear
boy
who
gave
you
that
name
with
a
returning
suspicion
that
something
might
have
betrayed
him
to
her
he
answered
interrogatively
godfathers
and
my
godmothers
dear
love
good
said
bella
goodest
good
because
you
hesitate
about
it
however
as
you
know
your
catechism
fairly
so
far
i
let
you
off
the
rest
now
i
am
going
to
examine
you
out
of
my
own
head
john
dear
why
did
you
go
back
this
evening
to
the
question
you
once
asked
me
before
would
i
like
to
be
rich
again
his
secret
he
looked
down
at
her
as
she
looked
up
at
him
with
her
hands
folded
on
his
knee
and
it
was
as
nearly
told
as
ever
secret
was
having
no
reply
ready
he
could
do
no
better
than
embrace
her
short
dear
john
said
bella
is
the
topic
of
my
lecture
i
want
nothing
on
earth
and
i
want
you
to
believe
it
that
all
the
lecture
may
be
considered
over
for
i
do
not
all
john
dear
bella
hesitated
only
firstly
a
dreadful
secondly
and
a
dreadful
thirdly
to
come
as
i
used
to
say
to
myself
in
when
i
was
a
very
sinner
at
church
them
come
my
dearest
you
sure
john
dear
are
you
absolutely
certain
in
your
innermost
heart
of
hearts
is
not
in
my
keeping
he
rejoined
john
but
the
key
are
you
absolutely
certain
that
down
at
the
bottom
of
that
heart
of
hearts
which
you
have
given
to
me
as
i
have
given
mine
to
you
there
is
no
remembrance
that
i
was
once
very
mercenary
if
there
were
no
remembrance
in
me
of
the
time
you
speak
of
he
softly
asked
her
with
his
lips
to
hers
i
love
you
quite
as
well
as
i
do
could
i
have
in
the
calendar
of
my
life
the
brightest
of
its
days
could
i
whenever
i
look
at
your
dear
face
or
hear
your
dear
voice
see
and
hear
my
noble
champion
it
can
never
have
been
that
which
made
you
serious
darling
john
it
was
that
and
still
less
was
it
mrs
boffin
though
i
love
her
wait
a
moment
and
i
go
on
with
the
lecture
give
me
a
moment
because
i
like
to
cry
for
joy
it
so
delicious
john
dear
to
cry
for
joy
she
did
so
on
his
neck
and
still
clinging
there
laughed
a
little
when
she
said
think
i
am
ready
now
for
thirdly
john
am
ready
for
thirdly
said
john
it
is
believe
john
pursued
bella
you
believe
that
i
believe
dear
child
cried
her
husband
gaily
a
quantity
of
believing
there
said
bella
with
another
laugh
never
knew
such
a
quantity
it
like
verbs
in
an
exercise
but
i
ca
get
on
with
less
believing
i
try
again
i
believe
dear
john
that
you
believe
that
i
believe
that
we
have
as
much
money
as
we
require
and
that
we
want
for
nothing
is
strictly
true
bella
if
our
money
should
by
any
means
be
rendered
not
so
much
if
we
had
to
stint
ourselves
a
little
in
purchases
that
we
can
afford
to
make
now
would
you
still
have
the
same
confidence
in
my
being
quite
contented
john
the
same
confidence
my
soul
you
john
dear
thousands
upon
thousands
of
times
and
i
may
take
it
for
granted
no
doubt
with
a
little
faltering
you
would
be
quite
as
contented
yourself
john
but
yes
i
know
i
may
for
knowing
that
i
should
be
so
how
surely
i
may
know
that
you
would
be
so
you
who
are
so
much
stronger
and
firmer
and
more
reasonable
and
more
generous
than
i
am
said
her
husband
must
not
hear
that
you
are
all
wrong
there
though
otherwise
as
right
as
can
be
and
now
i
am
brought
to
a
little
piece
of
news
my
dearest
that
i
might
have
told
you
earlier
in
the
evening
i
have
strong
reason
for
confidently
believing
that
we
shall
never
be
in
the
receipt
of
a
smaller
income
than
our
present
income
she
might
have
shown
herself
more
interested
in
the
intelligence
but
she
had
returned
to
the
investigation
of
the
that
had
engaged
her
attention
a
few
hours
before
and
scarcely
seemed
to
heed
what
he
said
now
we
have
got
to
the
bottom
of
it
at
last
cried
her
husband
rallying
her
this
is
the
thing
that
made
you
serious
dear
said
bella
twisting
the
button
and
shaking
her
head
was
this
then
lord
bless
this
little
wife
of
mine
there
a
fourthly
exclaimed
john
worried
me
a
little
and
so
did
secondly
said
bella
occupied
with
the
button
it
was
quite
another
sort
of
seriousness
a
much
deeper
and
quieter
sort
of
seriousness
that
i
spoke
of
john
dear
as
he
bent
his
face
to
hers
she
raised
hers
to
meet
it
and
laid
her
little
right
hand
on
his
eyes
and
kept
it
there
you
remember
john
on
the
day
we
were
married
pa
speaking
of
the
ships
that
might
be
sailing
towards
us
from
the
unknown
seas
my
darling
think
among
them
there
is
a
ship
upon
the
ocean
bringing
to
you
and
me
a

chapter
a
cry
for
help
the
paper
mill
had
stopped
work
for
the
night
and
the
paths
and
roads
in
its
neighbourhood
were
sprinkled
with
clusters
of
people
going
home
from
their
day
labour
in
it
there
were
men
women
and
children
in
the
groups
and
there
was
no
want
of
lively
colour
to
flutter
in
the
gentle
evening
wind
the
mingling
of
various
voices
and
the
sound
of
laughter
made
a
cheerful
impression
upon
the
ear
analogous
to
that
of
the
fluttering
colours
upon
the
eye
into
the
sheet
of
water
reflecting
the
flushed
sky
in
the
foreground
of
the
living
picture
a
knot
of
urchins
were
casting
stones
and
watching
the
expansion
of
the
rippling
circles
so
in
the
rosy
evening
one
might
watch
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
beyond
the
workers
wending
home
beyond
the
silver
river
beyond
the
deep
green
fields
of
corn
so
prospering
that
the
loiterers
in
their
narrow
threads
of
pathway
seemed
to
float
immersed
beyond
the
hedgerows
and
the
clumps
of
trees
beyond
the
windmills
on
the
ridge
away
to
where
the
sky
appeared
to
meet
the
earth
as
if
there
were
no
immensity
of
space
between
mankind
and
heaven
it
was
a
saturday
evening
and
at
such
a
time
the
village
dogs
always
much
more
interested
in
the
doings
of
humanity
than
in
the
affairs
of
their
own
species
were
particularly
active
at
the
general
shop
at
the
butcher
and
at
the
they
evinced
an
inquiring
spirit
never
to
be
satiated
their
especial
interest
in
the

seem
to
imply
some
latent
rakishness
in
the
canine
character

little

eaten
there
and
they
having
no
taste
for

or
tobacco
mrs
hubbard
dog
is
said
to
have
smoked
but
proof
is
wanting
could
only
have
been
attracted
by
sympathy
with
loose
convivial
habits
moreover
a
most
wretched
fiddle
played
within
a
fiddle
so
unutterably
vile
that
one
lean
cur
with
a
better
ear
than
the
rest
found
himself
under
compulsion
at
intervals
to
go
round
the
corner
and
howl
yet
even
he
returned
to
the
on
each
occasion
with
the
tenacity
of
a
confirmed
drunkard
fearful
to
relate
there
was
even
a
sort
of
little
fair
in
the
village
some
despairing
gingerbread
that
had
been
vainly
trying
to
dispose
of
itself
all
over
the
country
and
had
cast
a
quantity
of
dust
upon
its
head
in
its
mortification

appealed
to
the
public

an
infirm

a

of
nuts
long
long
exiled
from

and
yet

so
indifferently
as
to
call
fourteen
of
themselves

the

a
fat
lady
perhaps
in
part
sustained
upon
postponed
pork
her
professional
associate

a
learned
pig
displayed
her
picture
in
a
low
dress
as
she
appeared
when
presented
at
court
several
yards
round
all
this
was
a
vicious
spectacle
as
any
poor
idea
of
amusement
on
the
part
of
the
rougher
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
in
this
land

shall
be

must
not
vary
the
rheumatism
with
amusement
they
may
vary
it
with
fever
and
ague
or
with
as
many
rheumatic
variations
as
they
have
joints
but
positively
not
with
entertainment
after
their
own
manner
the
various
sounds
arising
from
this
scene
of
depravity
and
floating
away
into
the
still
evening
air
made
the
evening
at
any
point
which
they
just
reached
fitfully
mellowed
by
the
distance
more
still
by
contrast
such
was
the
stillness
of
the
evening
to
eugene
wrayburn
as
he
walked
by
the
river
with
his
hands
behind
him
he
walked
slowly
and
with
the
measured
step
and
preoccupied
air
of
one
who
was
waiting
he
walked
between
the
two
points
an
at
this
end
and
some
floating
lilies
at
that
and
at
each
point
stopped
and
looked
expectantly
in
one
direction
is
very
quiet
said
he
it
was
very
quiet
some
sheep
were
grazing
on
the
grass
by
the
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
before
heard
the
crisp
tearing
sound
with
which
they
cropped
it
he
stopped
idly
and
looked
at
them
are
stupid
enough
i
suppose
but
if
you
are
clever
enough
to
get
through
life
tolerably
to
your
satisfaction
you
have
got
the
better
of
me
man
as
i
am
and
mutton
as
you
are
a
rustle
in
a
field
beyond
the
hedge
attracted
his
attention
here
to
do
he
asked
himself
leisurely
going
towards
the
gate
and
looking
over
jealous
no
pleasures
of
the
chase
in
this
part
of
the
country
mostly
fishing
hereabouts
the
field
had
been
newly
mown
and
there
were
yet
the
marks
of
the
scythe
on
the
ground
and
the
track
of
wheels
where
the
hay
had
been
carried
following
the
tracks
with
his
eyes
the
view
closed
with
the
new
hayrick
in
a
corner
now
if
he
had
gone
on
to
the
hayrick
and
gone
round
it
but
say
that
the
event
was
to
be
as
the
event
fell
out
and
how
idle
are
such
suppositions
besides
if
he
had
gone
what
is
there
of
warning
in
a
bargeman
lying
on
his
face
bird
flying
to
the
hedge
was
all
he
thought
about
it
and
came
back
and
resumed
his
walk
i
had
not
a
reliance
on
her
being
truthful
said
eugene
after
taking
some
turns
should
begin
to
think
she
had
given
me
the
slip
for
the
second
time
but
she
promised
and
she
is
a
girl
of
her
word
turning
again
at
the
he
saw
her
coming
and
advanced
to
meet
her
was
saying
to
myself
lizzie
that
you
were
sure
to
come
though
you
were
late
had
to
linger
through
the
village
as
if
i
had
no
object
before
me
and
i
had
to
speak
to
several
people
in
passing
along
mr
wrayburn
the
lads
of
the
village
and
the
ladies
such
he
asked
as
he
took
her
hand
and
drew
it
through
his
arm
she
submitted
to
walk
slowly
on
with
downcast
eyes
he
put
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
she
quietly
drew
it
away
you
walk
beside
me
mr
wrayburn
and
not
touch
me
for
his
arm
was
already
stealing
round
her
waist
she
stopped
again
and
gave
him
an
earnest
supplicating
look
lizzie
well
said
he
in
an
easy
way
though
ill
at
ease
with
himself
be
unhappy
do
be
reproachful
can
not
help
being
unhappy
but
i
do
not
mean
to
be
reproachful
mr
wrayburn
i
implore
you
to
go
away
from
this
neighbourhood
morning
lizzie
lizzie
he
remonstrated
well
be
reproachful
as
wholly
unreasonable
i
ca
go
away
not
said
eugene
in
his
airily
candid
manner
you
wo
let
me
mind
i
do
mean
to
be
reproachful
either
i
do
complain
that
you
design
to
keep
me
here
but
you
do
it
you
do
it
you
walk
beside
me
and
not
touch
me
for
his
arm
was
coming
about
her
again
i
speak
to
you
very
seriously
mr
wrayburn
will
do
anything
within
the
limits
of
possibility
for
you
lizzie
he
answered
with
pleasant
gaiety
as
he
folded
his
arms
here
napoleon
buonaparte
at
st
helena
you
spoke
to
me
as
i
came
from
the
mill
the
night
before
last
said
lizzie
fixing
her
eyes
upon
him
with
the
look
of
supplication
which
troubled
his
better
nature
told
me
that
you
were
much
surprised
to
see
me
and
that
you
were
on
a
solitary
fishing
excursion
was
it
true
was
not
replied
eugene
composedly
the
least
true
i
came
here
because
i
had
information
that
i
should
find
you
here
you
imagine
why
i
left
london
mr
wrayburn
am
afraid
lizzie
he
openly
answered
you
left
london
to
get
rid
of
me
it
is
not
flattering
to
my
but
i
am
afraid
you
did
did
could
you
be
so
cruel
mr
wrayburn
she
answered
suddenly
breaking
into
tears
the
cruelty
on
my
side
o
mr
wrayburn
mr
wrayburn
is
there
no
cruelty
in
your
being
here
the
name
of
all
that
good
and
that
is
not
conjuring
you
in
my
own
name
for
heaven
knows
i
am
not
good
said
eugene
be
distressed
else
can
i
be
when
i
know
the
distance
and
the
difference
between
us
what
else
can
i
be
when
to
tell
me
why
you
came
here
is
to
put
me
to
shame
said
lizzie
covering
her
face
he
looked
at
her
with
a
real
sentiment
of
remorseful
tenderness
and
pity
it
was
not
strong
enough
to
impell
him
to
sacrifice
himself
and
spare
her
but
it
was
a
strong
emotion
i
never
thought
before
that
there
was
a
woman
in
the
world
who
could
affect
me
so
much
by
saying
so
little
but
do
be
hard
in
your
construction
of
me
you
do
know
what
my
state
of
mind
towards
you
is
you
do
know
how
you
haunt
me
and
bewilder
me
you
do
know
how
the
cursed
carelessness
that
is
in
helping
me
at
every
other
turning
of
my
life
wo
help
me
here
you
have
struck
it
dead
i
think
and
i
sometimes
almost
wish
you
had
struck
me
dead
along
with
it
she
had
not
been
prepared
for
such
passionate
expressions
and
they
awakened
some
natural
sparks
of
feminine
pride
and
joy
in
her
breast
to
consider
wrong
as
he
was
that
he
could
care
so
much
for
her
and
that
she
had
the
power
to
move
him
so
grieves
you
to
see
me
distressed
mr
wrayburn
it
grieves
me
to
see
you
distressed
i
do
reproach
you
indeed
i
do
reproach
you
you
have
not
felt
this
as
i
feel
it
being
so
different
from
me
and
beginning
from
another
point
of
view
you
have
not
thought
but
i
entreat
you
to
think
now
think
now
am
i
to
think
of
asked
eugene
bitterly
of
me
me
how
not
to
think
of
you
lizzie
and
you
change
me
altogether
do
mean
in
that
way
think
of
me
as
belonging
to
another
station
and
quite
cut
off
from
you
in
honour
remember
that
i
have
no
protector
near
me
unless
i
have
one
in
your
noble
heart
respect
my
good
name
if
you
feel
towards
me
in
one
particular
as
you
might
if
i
was
a
lady
give
me
the
full
claims
of
a
lady
upon
your
generous
behaviour
i
am
removed
from
you
and
your
family
by
being
a
working
girl
how
true
a
gentleman
to
be
as
considerate
of
me
as
if
i
was
removed
by
being
a
queen
he
would
have
been
base
indeed
to
have
stood
untouched
by
her
appeal
his
face
expressed
contrition
and
indecision
as
he
asked
i
injured
you
so
much
lizzie
no
you
may
set
me
quite
right
i
do
speak
of
the
past
mr
wrayburn
but
of
the
present
and
the
future
are
we
not
here
now
because
through
two
days
you
have
followed
me
so
closely
where
there
are
so
many
eyes
to
see
you
that
i
consented
to
this
appointment
as
an
escape
not
very
flattering
to
my
said
eugene
moodily
yes
yes
yes
i
beseech
you
mr
wrayburn
i
beg
and
pray
you
leave
this
neighbourhood
if
you
do
not
consider
to
what
you
will
drive
me
he
did
consider
within
himself
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
retorted
you
to
what
shall
i
drive
you
lizzie
will
drive
me
away
i
live
here
peacefully
and
respected
and
i
am
well
employed
here
you
will
force
me
to
quit
this
place
as
i
quitted
london
and
by
following
me
again
will
force
me
to
quit
the
next
place
in
which
i
may
find
refuge
as
i
quitted
this
you
so
determined
lizzie
forgive
the
word
i
am
going
to
use
for
its
literal
truth
to
fly
from
a
lover
am
so
determined
she
answered
resolutely
though
trembling
fly
from
such
a
lover
there
was
a
poor
woman
died
here
but
a
little
while
ago
scores
of
years
older
than
i
am
whom
i
found
by
chance
lying
on
the
wet
earth
you
may
have
heard
some
account
of
her
think
i
have
he
answered
her
name
was
higden
name
was
higden
though
she
was
so
weak
and
old
she
kept
true
to
one
purpose
to
the
very
last
even
at
the
very
last
she
made
me
promise
that
her
purpose
should
be
kept
to
after
she
was
dead
so
settled
was
her
determination
what
she
did
i
can
do
mr
wrayburn
if
i
believed
but
i
do
not
believe
that
you
could
be
so
cruel
to
me
as
to
drive
me
from
place
to
place
to
wear
me
out
you
should
drive
me
to
death
and
not
do
it
he
looked
full
at
her
handsome
face
and
in
his
own
handsome
face
there
was
a
light
of
blended
admiration
anger
and
reproach
which
she
who
loved
him
so
in
secret
whose
heart
had
long
been
so
full
and
he
the
cause
of
its
overflowing
drooped
before
she
tried
hard
to
retain
her
firmness
but
he
saw
it
melting
away
under
his
eyes
in
the
moment
of
its
dissolution
and
of
his
first
full
knowledge
of
his
influence
upon
her
she
dropped
and
he
caught
her
on
his
arm
rest
so
a
moment
answer
what
i
ask
you
if
i
had
not
been
what
you
call
removed
from
you
and
cut
off
from
you
would
you
have
made
this
appeal
to
me
to
leave
you
do
know
i
do
know
do
ask
me
mr
wrayburn
let
me
go
back
swear
to
you
lizzie
you
shall
go
directly
i
swear
to
you
you
shall
go
alone
i
not
accompany
you
i
not
follow
you
if
you
will
reply
can
i
mr
wrayburn
how
can
i
tell
you
what
i
should
have
done
if
you
had
not
been
what
you
are
i
had
not
been
what
you
make
me
out
to
be
he
struck
in
skilfully
changing
the
form
of
words
you
still
have
hated
me
mr
wrayburn
she
replied
appealingly
and
weeping
know
me
better
than
to
think
i
do
i
had
not
been
what
you
make
me
out
to
be
lizzie
would
you
still
have
been
indifferent
to
me
mr
wrayburn
she
answered
as
before
know
me
better
than
that
too
there
was
something
in
the
attitude
of
her
whole
figure
as
he
supported
it
and
she
hung
her
head
which
besought
him
to
be
merciful
and
not
force
her
to
disclose
her
heart
he
was
not
merciful
with
her
and
he
made
her
do
it
i
know
you
better
than
quite
to
believe
unfortunate
dog
though
i
am
that
you
hate
me
or
even
that
you
are
wholly
indifferent
to
me
lizzie
let
me
know
so
much
more
from
yourself
before
we
separate
let
me
know
how
you
would
have
dealt
with
me
if
you
had
regarded
me
as
being
what
you
would
have
considered
on
equal
terms
with
you
is
impossible
mr
wrayburn
how
can
i
think
of
you
as
being
on
equal
terms
with
me
if
my
mind
could
put
you
on
equal
terms
with
me
you
could
not
be
yourself
how
could
i
remember
then
the
night
when
i
first
saw
you
and
when
i
went
out
of
the
room
because
you
looked
at
me
so
attentively
or
the
night
that
passed
into
the
morning
when
you
broke
to
me
that
my
father
was
dead
or
the
nights
when
you
used
to
come
to
see
me
at
my
next
home
or
your
having
known
how
uninstructed
i
was
and
having
caused
me
to
be
taught
better
or
my
having
so
looked
up
to
you
and
wondered
at
you
and
at
first
thought
you
so
good
to
be
at
all
mindful
of
me
at
first
thought
me
so
good
lizzie
what
did
you
think
me
after
at
first
so
bad
do
say
that
i
do
mean
that
but
after
the
first
wonder
and
pleasure
of
being
noticed
by
one
so
different
from
any
one
who
had
ever
spoken
to
me
i
began
to
feel
that
it
might
have
been
better
if
i
had
never
seen
you
you
were
so
different
she
answered
in
a
lower
voice
it
was
so
endless
so
hopeless
spare
me
you
think
for
me
at
all
lizzie
he
asked
as
if
he
were
a
little
stung
much
mr
wrayburn
not
much
until
you
tell
me
why
never
supposed
until
that
you
needed
to
be
thought
for
but
if
you
do
need
to
be
if
you
do
truly
feel
at
heart
that
you
have
indeed
been
towards
me
what
you
have
called
yourself
and
that
there
is
nothing
for
us
in
this
life
but
separation
then
heaven
help
you
and
heaven
bless
you
the
purity
with
which
in
these
words
she
expressed
something
of
her
own
love
and
her
own
suffering
made
a
deep
impression
on
him
for
the
passing
time
he
held
her
almost
as
if
she
were
sanctified
to
him
by
death
and
kissed
her
once
almost
as
he
might
have
kissed
the
dead
promised
that
i
would
not
accompany
you
nor
follow
you
shall
i
keep
you
in
view
you
have
been
agitated
and
it
growing
dark
am
used
to
be
out
alone
at
this
hour
and
i
entreat
you
not
to
do
so
promise
i
can
bring
myself
to
promise
nothing
more
tonight
lizzie
except
that
i
will
try
what
i
can
do
is
but
one
means
mr
wrayburn
of
sparing
yourself
and
of
sparing
me
every
way
leave
this
neighbourhood
morning
will
try
as
he
spoke
the
words
in
a
grave
voice
she
put
her
hand
in
his
removed
it
and
went
away
by
the
could
mortimer
believe
this
murmured
eugene
still
remaining
after
a
while
where
she
had
left
him
i
even
believe
it
myself
he
referred
to
the
circumstance
that
there
were
tears
upon
his
hand
as
he
stood
covering
his
eyes
most
ridiculous
position
this
to
be
found
out
in
was
his
next
thought
and
his
next
struck
its
root
in
a
little
rising
resentment
against
the
cause
of
the
tears
i
have
gained
a
wonderful
power
over
her
too
let
her
be
as
much
in
earnest
as
she
will
the
reflection
brought
back
the
yielding
of
her
face
and
form
as
she
had
drooped
under
his
gaze
contemplating
the
reproduction
he
seemed
to
see
for
the
second
time
in
the
appeal
and
in
the
confession
of
weakness
a
little
fear
she
loves
me
and
so
earnest
a
character
must
be
very
earnest
in
that
passion
she
can
not
choose
for
herself
to
be
strong
in
this
fancy
wavering
in
that
and
weak
in
the
other
she
must
go
through
with
her
nature
as
i
must
go
through
with
mine
if
mine
exacts
its
pains
and
penalties
all
round
so
must
hers
i
suppose
pursuing
the
inquiry
into
his
own
nature
he
thought
if
i
married
her
if
outfacing
the
absurdity
of
the
situation
in
correspondence
with
i
astonished
to
the
utmost
extent
of
his
respected
powers
by
informing
him
that
i
had
married
her
how
would
reason
with
the
legal
mind
you
would
marry
for
some
money
and
some
station
because
you
were
frightfully
likely
to
become
bored
are
you
less
frightfully
likely
to
become
bored
marrying
for
no
money
and
no
station
are
you
sure
of
yourself
legal
mind
in
spite
of
forensic
protestations
must
secretly
admit
good
reasoning
on
the
part
of
not
sure
of
in
the
very
act
of
calling
this
tone
of
levity
to
his
aid
he
felt
it
to
be
profligate
and
worthless
and
asserted
her
against
it
yet
said
eugene
should
like
to
see
the
fellow
mortimer
excepted
who
would
undertake
to
tell
me
that
this
was
not
a
real
sentiment
on
my
part
won
out
of
me
by
her
beauty
and
her
worth
in
spite
of
myself
and
that
i
would
not
be
true
to
her
i
should
particularly
like
to
see
the
fellow
who
would
tell
me
so
or
who
would
tell
me
anything
that
could
be
construed
to
her
disadvantage
for
i
am
wearily
out
of
sorts
with
one
wrayburn
who
cuts
a
sorry
figure
and
i
would
far
rather
be
out
of
sorts
with
somebody
else
eugene
eugene
eugene
this
is
a
bad
ah
so
go
the
mortimer
lightwood
bells
and
they
sound
melancholy
strolling
on
he
thought
of
something
else
to
take
himself
to
task
for
is
the
analogy
brute
beast
he
said
impatiently
a
woman
whom
your
father
coolly
finds
out
for
you
and
a
woman
whom
you
have
found
out
for
yourself
and
have
ever
drifted
after
with
more
and
more
of
constancy
since
you
first
set
eyes
upon
her
ass
can
you
reason
no
better
than
that
but
again
he
subsided
into
a
reminiscence
of
his
first
full
knowledge
of
his
power
just
now
and
of
her
disclosure
of
her
heart
to
try
no
more
to
go
away
and
to
try
her
again
was
the
reckless
conclusion
it
turned
uppermost
and
yet
again
eugene
eugene
this
is
a
bad
business
and
wish
i
could
stop
the
lightwood
peal
for
it
sounds
like
a
knell
looking
above
he
found
that
the
young
moon
was
up
and
that
the
stars
were
beginning
to
shine
in
the
sky
from
which
the
tones
of
red
and
yellow
were
flickering
out
in
favour
of
the
calm
blue
of
a
summer
night
he
was
still
by
the
turning
suddenly
he
met
a
man
so
close
upon
him
that
eugene
surprised
stepped
back
to
avoid
a
collision
the
man
carried
something
over
his
shoulder
which
might
have
been
a
broken
oar
or
spar
or
bar
and
took
no
notice
of
him
but
passed
on
friend
said
eugene
calling
after
him
you
blind
the
man
made
no
reply
but
went
his
way
eugene
wrayburn
went
the
opposite
way
with
his
hands
behind
him
and
his
purpose
in
his
thoughts
he
passed
the
sheep
and
passed
the
gate
and
came
within
hearing
of
the
village
sounds
and
came
to
the
bridge
the
inn
where
he
stayed
like
the
village
and
the
mill
was
not
across
the
river
but
on
that
side
of
the
stream
on
which
he
walked
however
knowing
the
rushy
bank
and
the
backwater
on
the
other
side
to
be
a
retired
place
and
feeling
out
of
humour
for
noise
or
company
he
crossed
the
bridge
and
sauntered
on
looking
up
at
the
stars
as
they
seemed
one
by
one
to
be
kindled
in
the
sky
and
looking
down
at
the
river
as
the
same
stars
seemed
to
be
kindled
deep
in
the
water
a
overshadowed
by
a
willow
and
a
lying
moored
there
among
some
stakes
caught
his
eye
as
he
passed
along
the
spot
was
in
such
dark
shadow
that
he
paused
to
make
out
what
was
there
and
then
passed
on
again
the
rippling
of
the
river
seemed
to
cause
a
correspondent
stir
in
his
uneasy
reflections
he
would
have
laid
them
asleep
if
he
could
but
they
were
in
movement
like
the
stream
and
all
tending
one
way
with
a
strong
current
as
the
ripple
under
the
moon
broke
unexpectedly
now
and
then
and
palely
flashed
in
a
new
shape
and
with
a
new
sound
so
parts
of
his
thoughts
started
unbidden
from
the
rest
and
revealed
their
wickedness
of
the
question
to
marry
her
said
eugene
out
of
the
question
to
leave
her
the
crisis
he
had
sauntered
far
enough
before
turning
to
retrace
his
steps
he
stopped
upon
the
margin
to
look
down
at
the
reflected
night
in
an
instant
with
a
dreadful
crash
the
reflected
night
turned
crooked
flames
shot
jaggedly
across
the
air
and
the
moon
and
stars
came
bursting
from
the
sky
was
he
struck
by
lightning
with
some
incoherent
thought
to
that
effect
he
turned
under
the
blows
that
were
blinding
him
and
mashing
his
life
and
closed
with
a
murderer
whom
he
caught
by
a
red
neckerchief
unless
the
raining
down
of
his
own
blood
gave
it
that
hue
eugene
was
light
active
and
expert
but
his
arms
were
broken
or
he
was
paralysed
and
could
do
no
more
than
hang
on
to
the
man
with
his
head
swung
back
so
that
he
could
see
nothing
but
the
heaving
sky
after
dragging
at
the
assailant
he
fell
on
the
bank
with
him
and
then
there
was
another
great
crash
and
then
a
splash
and
all
was
done
lizzie
hexam
too
had
avoided
the
noise
and
the
saturday
movement
of
people
in
the
straggling
street
and
chose
to
walk
alone
by
the
water
until
her
tears
should
be
dry
and
she
could
so
compose
herself
as
to
escape
remark
upon
her
looking
ill
or
unhappy
on
going
home
the
peaceful
serenity
of
the
hour
and
place
having
no
reproaches
or
evil
intentions
within
her
breast
to
contend
against
sank
healingly
into
its
depths
she
had
meditated
and
taken
comfort
she
too
was
turning
homeward
when
she
heard
a
strange
sound
it
startled
her
for
it
was
like
a
sound
of
blows
she
stood
still
and
listened
it
sickened
her
for
blows
fell
heavily
and
cruelly
on
the
quiet
of
the
night
as
she
listened
undecided
all
was
silent
as
she
yet
listened
she
heard
a
faint
groan
and
a
fall
into
the
river
her
old
bold
life
and
habit
instantly
inspired
her
without
vain
waste
of
breath
in
crying
for
help
where
there
were
none
to
hear
she
ran
towards
the
spot
from
which
the
sounds
had
come
it
lay
between
her
and
the
bridge
but
it
was
more
removed
from
her
than
she
had
thought
the
night
being
so
very
quiet
and
sound
travelling
far
with
the
help
of
water
at
length
she
reached
a
part
of
the
green
bank
much
and
newly
trodden
where
there
lay
some
broken
splintered
pieces
of
wood
and
some
torn
fragments
of
clothes
stooping
she
saw
that
the
grass
was
bloody
following
the
drops
and
smears
she
saw
that
the
watery
margin
of
the
bank
was
bloody
following
the
current
with
her
eyes
she
saw
a
bloody
face
turned
up
towards
the
moon
and
drifting
away
now
merciful
heaven
be
thanked
for
that
old
time
and
grant
o
blessed
lord
that
through
thy
wonderful
workings
it
may
turn
to
good
at
last
to
whomsoever
the
drifting
face
belongs
be
it
man
or
woman
help
my
humble
hands
lord
god
to
raise
it
from
death
and
restore
it
to
some
one
to
whom
it
must
be
dear
it
was
thought
fervently
thought
but
not
for
a
moment
did
the
prayer
check
her
she
was
away
before
it
welled
up
in
her
mind
away
swift
and
true
yet
steady
above
all
for
without
steadiness
it
could
never
be
done
to
the
under
the
where
she
also
had
seen
the
boat
lying
moored
among
the
stakes
a
sure
touch
of
her
old
practised
hand
a
sure
step
of
her
old
practised
foot
a
sure
light
balance
of
her
body
and
she
was
in
the
boat
a
quick
glance
of
her
practised
eye
showed
her
even
through
the
deep
dark
shadow
the
sculls
in
a
rack
against
the
another
moment
and
she
had
cast
off
taking
the
line
with
her
and
the
boat
had
shot
out
into
the
moonlight
and
she
was
rowing
down
the
stream
as
never
other
woman
rowed
on
english
water
intently
over
her
shoulder
without
slackening
speed
she
looked
ahead
for
the
driving
face
she
passed
the
scene
of
the
struggle
yonder
it
was
on
her
left
well
over
the
boat
stern
she
passed
on
her
right
the
end
of
the
village
street
a
hilly
street
that
almost
dipped
into
the
river
its
sounds
were
growing
faint
again
and
she
slackened
looking
as
the
boat
drove
everywhere
everywhere
for
the
floating
face
she
merely
kept
the
boat
before
the
stream
now
and
rested
on
her
oars
knowing
well
that
if
the
face
were
not
soon
visible
it
had
gone
down
and
she
would
overshoot
it
an
untrained
sight
would
never
have
seen
by
the
moonlight
what
she
saw
at
the
length
of
a
few
strokes
astern
she
saw
the
drowning
figure
rise
to
the
surface
slightly
struggle
and
as
if
by
instinct
turn
over
on
its
back
to
float
just
so
had
she
first
dimly
seen
the
face
which
she
now
dimly
saw
again
firm
of
look
and
firm
of
purpose
she
intently
watched
its
coming
on
until
it
was
very
near
then
with
a
touch
unshipped
her
sculls
and
crept
aft
in
the
boat
between
kneeling
and
crouching
once
she
let
the
body
evade
her
not
being
sure
of
her
grasp
twice
and
she
had
seized
it
by
its
bloody
hair
it
was
insensible
if
not
virtually
dead
it
was
mutilated
and
streaked
the
water
all
about
it
with
dark
red
streaks
as
it
could
not
help
itself
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
get
it
on
board
she
bent
over
the
stern
to
secure
it
with
the
line
and
then
the
river
and
its
shores
rang
to
the
terrible
cry
she
uttered
but
as
if
possessed
by
supernatural
spirit
and
strength
she
lashed
it
safe
resumed
her
seat
and
rowed
in
desperately
for
the
nearest
shallow
water
where
she
might
run
the
boat
aground
desperately
but
not
wildly
for
she
knew
that
if
she
lost
distinctness
of
intention
all
was
lost
and
gone
she
ran
the
boat
ashore
went
into
the
water
released
him
from
the
line
and
by
main
strength
lifted
him
in
her
arms
and
laid
him
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
he
had
fearful
wounds
upon
him
and
she
bound
them
up
with
her
dress
torn
into
strips
else
supposing
him
to
be
still
alive
she
foresaw
that
he
must
bleed
to
death
before
he
could
be
landed
at
his
inn
which
was
the
nearest
place
for
succour
this
done
very
rapidly
she
kissed
his
disfigured
forehead
looked
up
in
anguish
to
the
stars
and
blessed
him
and
forgave
him
she
had
anything
to
forgive
it
was
only
in
that
instant
that
she
thought
of
herself
and
then
she
thought
of
herself
only
for
him
now
merciful
heaven
be
thanked
for
that
old
time
enabling
me
without
a
wasted
moment
to
have
got
the
boat
afloat
again
and
to
row
back
against
the
stream
and
grant
o
blessed
lord
god
that
through
poor
me
he
may
be
raised
from
death
and
preserved
to
some
one
else
to
whom
he
may
be
dear
one
day
though
never
dearer
than
to
me
she
rowed
hard
rowed
desperately
but
never
wildly
and
seldom
removed
her
eyes
from
him
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
she
had
so
laid
him
there
as
that
she
might
see
his
disfigured
face
it
was
so
much
disfigured
that
his
mother
might
have
covered
it
but
it
was
above
and
beyond
disfigurement
in
her
eyes
the
boat
touched
the
edge
of
the
patch
of
inn
lawn
sloping
gently
to
the
water
there
were
lights
in
the
windows
but
there
chanced
to
be
no
one
out
of
doors
she
made
the
boat
fast
and
again
by
main
strength
took
him
up
and
never
laid
him
down
until
she
laid
him
down
in
the
house
surgeons
were
sent
for
and
she
sat
supporting
his
head
she
had
oftentimes
heard
in
days
that
were
gone
how
doctors
would
lift
the
hand
of
an
insensible
wounded
person
and
would
drop
it
if
the
person
were
dead
she
waited
for
the
awful
moment
when
the
doctors
might
lift
this
hand
all
broken
and
bruised
and
let
it
fall
the
first
of
the
surgeons
came
and
asked
before
proceeding
to
his
examination
brought
him
in
brought
him
in
sir
answered
lizzie
at
whom
all
present
looked
my
dear
you
could
not
lift
far
less
carry
this
weight
think
i
could
not
at
another
time
sir
but
i
am
sure
i
did
the
surgeon
looked
at
her
with
great
attention
and
with
some
compassion
having
with
a
grave
face
touched
the
wounds
upon
the
head
and
the
broken
arms
he
took
the
hand
o
would
he
let
it
drop
he
appeared
irresolute
he
did
not
retain
it
but
laid
it
gently
down
took
a
candle
looked
more
closely
at
the
injuries
on
the
head
and
at
the
pupils
of
the
eyes
that
done
he
replaced
the
candle
and
took
the
hand
again
another
surgeon
then
coming
in
the
two
exchanged
a
whisper
and
the
second
took
the
hand
neither
did
he
let
it
fall
at
once
but
kept
it
for
a
while
and
laid
it
gently
down
to
the
poor
girl
said
the
first
surgeon
then
is
quite
unconscious
she
sees
nothing
and
hears
nothing
all
the
better
for
her
do
rouse
her
if
you
can
help
it
only
move
her
poor
girl
poor
girl
she
must
be
amazingly
strong
of
heart
but
it
is
much
to
be
feared
that
she
has
set
her
heart
upon
the
dead
be
gentle
with
her
chapter
better
to
be
abel
than
cain
day
was
breaking
at
plashwater
weir
mill
lock
stars
were
yet
visible
but
there
was
dull
light
in
the
east
that
was
not
the
light
of
night
the
moon
had
gone
down
and
a
mist
crept
along
the
banks
of
the
river
seen
through
which
the
trees
were
the
ghosts
of
trees
and
the
water
was
the
ghost
of
water
this
earth
looked
spectral
and
so
did
the
pale
stars
while
the
cold
eastern
glare
expressionless
as
to
heat
or
colour
with
the
eye
of
the
firmament
quenched
might
have
been
likened
to
the
stare
of
the
dead
perhaps
it
was
so
likened
by
the
lonely
bargeman
standing
on
the
brink
of
the
lock
for
certain
bradley
headstone
looked
that
way
when
a
chill
air
came
up
and
when
it
passed
on
murmuring
as
if
it
whispered
something
that
made
the
phantom
trees
and
water
tremble
or
threaten
for
fancy
might
have
made
it
either
he
turned
away
and
tried
the
door
it
was
fastened
on
the
inside
he
afraid
of
me
he
muttered
knocking
rogue
riderhood
was
soon
roused
and
soon
undrew
the
bolt
and
let
him
in
i
thought
you
had
been
and
got
lost
two
nights
away
i
believed
as
you
giv
me
the
slip
and
i
had
as
good
as
half
a
mind
for
to
advertise
you
in
the
newspapers
to
come
bradley
face
turned
so
dark
on
this
hint
that
riderhood
deemed
it
expedient
to
soften
it
into
a
compliment
not
you
governor
not
you
he
went
on
stolidly
shaking
his
head
what
did
i
say
to
myself
arter
having
amused
myself
with
that
there
stretch
of
a
comic
idea
as
a
sort
of
a
playful
game
why
i
says
to
myself
he
a
man
o
that
what
i
says
to
myself
he
a
man
o
double
very
remarkably
riderhood
put
no
question
to
him
he
had
looked
at
him
on
opening
the
door
and
he
now
looked
at
him
again
stealthily
this
time
and
the
result
of
his
looking
was
that
he
asked
him
no
question
be
for
another
forty
on
governor
as
i
judges
afore
you
turns
your
mind
to
breakfast
said
riderhood
when
his
visitor
sat
down
resting
his
chin
on
his
hand
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
and
very
remarkably
again
riderhood
feigned
to
set
the
scanty
furniture
in
order
while
he
spoke
to
have
a
show
of
reason
for
not
looking
at
him
i
had
better
sleep
i
think
said
bradley
without
changing
his
position
myself
should
recommend
it
governor
assented
riderhood
you
be
anyways
dry
i
should
like
a
drink
said
bradley
but
without
appearing
to
attend
much
mr
riderhood
got
out
his
bottle
and
fetched
his
of
water
and
administered
a
potation
then
he
shook
the
coverlet
of
his
bed
and
spread
it
smooth
and
bradley
stretched
himself
upon
it
in
the
clothes
he
wore
mr
riderhood
poetically
remarking
that
he
would
pick
the
bones
of
his
night
rest
in
his
wooden
chair
sat
in
the
window
as
before
but
as
before
watched
the
sleeper
narrowly
until
he
was
very
sound
asleep
then
he
rose
and
looked
at
him
close
in
the
bright
daylight
on
every
side
with
great
minuteness
he
went
out
to
his
lock
to
sum
up
what
he
had
seen
of
his
sleeves
is
tore
right
away
below
the
elber
and
the
had
a
good
rip
at
the
shoulder
he
been
hung
on
to
pretty
tight
for
his
shirt
all
tore
out
of
the
he
been
in
the
grass
and
he
been
in
the
water
and
he
spotted
and
i
know
with
what
and
with
whose
hooroar
bradley
slept
long
early
in
the
afternoon
a
barge
came
down
other
barges
had
passed
through
both
ways
before
it
but
the
hailed
only
this
particular
barge
for
news
as
if
he
had
made
a
time
calculation
with
some
nicety
the
men
on
board
told
him
a
piece
of
news
and
there
was
a
lingering
on
their
part
to
enlarge
upon
it
twelve
hours
had
intervened
since
bradley
lying
down
when
he
got
up
that
i
swaller
it
said
riderhood
squinting
at
his
lock
when
he
saw
bradley
coming
out
of
the
house
you
been
a
sleeping
all
the
time
old
boy
bradley
came
to
him
sitting
on
his
wooden
lever
and
asked
what
it
was
riderhood
told
him
it
was
between
two
and
three
are
you
relieved
asked
bradley
arter
governor
sooner
a
inch
sooner
governor
on
both
sides
importance
seemed
attached
to
this
question
of
relief
riderhood
quite
petted
his
reply
saying
a
second
time
and
prolonging
a
negative
roll
of
his
head
n
not
a
inch
sooner
governor
i
tell
you
i
was
going
on
asked
bradley
governor
returned
riderhood
in
a
cheerful
affable
and
conversational
manner
did
not
tell
me
so
but
most
like
you
meant
to
it
and
forgot
to
it
how
otherways
could
a
doubt
have
come
into
your
head
about
it
governor
the
sun
goes
down
i
intend
to
go
on
said
bradley
much
the
more
necessairy
is
a
peck
returned
riderhood
in
and
have
it
the
formality
of
spreading
a
tablecloth
not
being
observed
in
mr
riderhood
establishment
the
serving
of
the
was
the
affair
of
a
moment
it
merely
consisting
in
the
handing
down
of
a
capacious
baking
dish
with
of
an
immense
meat
pie
in
it
and
the
production
of
two
an
earthenware
mug
and
a
large
brown
bottle
of
beer
both
ate
and
drank
but
riderhood
much
the
more
abundantly
in
lieu
of
plates
that
honest
man
cut
two
triangular
pieces
from
the
thick
crust
of
the
pie
and
laid
them
inside
uppermost
upon
the
table
the
one
before
himself
and
the
other
before
his
guest
upon
these
platters
he
placed
two
goodly
portions
of
the
contents
of
the
pie
thus
imparting
the
unusual
interest
to
the
entertainment
that
each
partaker
scooped
out
the
inside
of
his
plate
and
consumed
it
with
his
other
fare
besides
having
the
sport
of
pursuing
the
clots
of
congealed
gravy
over
the
plain
of
the
table
and
successfully
taking
them
into
his
mouth
at
last
from
the
blade
of
his
knife
in
case
of
their
not
first
sliding
off
it
bradley
headstone
was
so
remarkably
awkward
at
these
exercises
that
the
rogue
observed
it
out
he
cried
cut
your
hand
but
the
caution
came
too
late
for
bradley
gashed
it
at
the
instant
and
what
was
more
unlucky
in
asking
riderhood
to
tie
it
up
and
in
standing
close
to
him
for
the
purpose
he
shook
his
hand
under
the
smart
of
the
wound
and
shook
blood
over
riderhood
dress
when
dinner
was
done
and
when
what
remained
of
the
platters
and
what
remained
of
the
congealed
gravy
had
been
put
back
into
what
remained
of
the
pie
which
served
as
an
economical
investment
for
all
miscellaneous
savings
riderhood
filled
the
mug
with
beer
and
took
a
long
drink
and
now
he
did
look
at
bradley
and
with
an
evil
eye
he
said
hoarsely
as
he
bent
across
the
table
to
touch
his
arm
news
has
gone
down
the
river
afore
you
news
do
you
think
said
riderhood
with
a
hitch
of
his
head
as
if
he
disdainfully
jerked
the
feint
away
up
the
body
guess
am
not
good
at
guessing
anything
did
hooroar
you
had
him
there
agin
she
did
the
convulsive
twitching
of
bradley
headstone
face
and
the
sudden
hot
humour
that
broke
out
upon
it
showed
how
grimly
the
intelligence
touched
him
but
he
said
not
a
single
word
good
or
bad
he
only
smiled
in
a
lowering
manner
and
got
up
and
stood
leaning
at
the
window
looking
through
it
riderhood
followed
him
with
his
eyes
riderhood
cast
down
his
eyes
on
his
own
besprinkled
clothes
riderhood
began
to
have
an
air
of
being
better
at
a
guess
than
bradley
owned
to
being
have
been
so
long
in
want
of
rest
said
the
schoolmaster
with
your
leave
i
lie
down
again
welcome
was
the
hospitable
answer
of
his
host
he
had
laid
himself
down
without
waiting
for
it
and
he
remained
upon
the
bed
until
the
sun
was
low
when
he
arose
and
came
out
to
resume
his
journey
he
found
his
host
waiting
for
him
on
the
grass
by
the
outside
the
door
it
may
be
necessary
that
you
and
i
should
have
any
further
communication
together
said
bradley
will
come
back
since
no
better
can
be
said
riderhood
turning
on
his
heel
but
he
turned
again
as
the
other
set
forth
and
added
under
his
breath
looking
after
him
with
a
leer
would
be
let
to
go
like
that
if
my
relief
war
as
good
as
come
i
catch
you
up
in
a
mile
in
a
word
his
real
time
of
relief
being
that
evening
at
sunset
his
mate
came
lounging
in
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
not
staying
to
fill
up
the
utmost
margin
of
his
time
but
borrowing
an
hour
or
so
to
be
repaid
again
when
he
should
relieve
his
reliever
riderhood
straightway
followed
on
the
track
of
bradley
headstone
he
was
a
better
follower
than
bradley
it
had
been
the
calling
of
his
life
to
slink
and
skulk
and
dog
and
waylay
and
he
knew
his
calling
well
he
effected
such
a
forced
march
on
leaving
the
lock
house
that
he
was
close
up
with
him
that
is
to
say
as
close
up
with
him
as
he
deemed
it
convenient
to
be
before
another
lock
was
passed
his
man
looked
back
pretty
often
as
he
went
but
got
no
hint
of
him
he
knew
how
to
take
advantage
of
the
ground
and
where
to
put
the
hedge
between
them
and
where
the
wall
and
when
to
duck
and
when
to
drop
and
had
a
thousand
arts
beyond
the
doomed
bradley
slow
conception
but
all
his
arts
were
brought
to
a
standstill
like
himself
when
bradley
turning
into
a
green
lane
or
riding
by
the
a
solitary
spot
run
wild
in
nettles
briars
and
brambles
and
encumbered
with
the
scathed
trunks
of
a
whole
hedgerow
of
felled
trees
on
the
outskirts
of
a
little
wood
began
stepping
on
these
trunks
and
dropping
down
among
them
and
stepping
on
them
again
apparently
as
a
schoolboy
might
have
done
but
assuredly
with
no
schoolboy
purpose
or
want
of
purpose
are
you
up
to
muttered
riderhood
down
in
the
ditch
and
holding
the
hedge
a
little
open
with
both
hands
and
soon
his
actions
made
a
most
extraordinary
reply
george
and
the
draggin
cried
riderhood
he
ai
a
going
to
bathe
he
had
passed
back
on
and
among
the
trunks
of
trees
again
and
has
passed
on
to
the
and
had
begun
undressing
on
the
grass
for
a
moment
it
had
a
suspicious
look
of
suicide
arranged
to
counterfeit
accident
you
would
have
fetched
a
bundle
under
your
arm
from
among
that
timber
if
such
was
your
game
said
riderhood
nevertheless
it
was
a
relief
to
him
when
the
bather
after
a
plunge
and
a
few
strokes
came
out
i
should
he
said
in
a
feeling
manner
liked
to
lose
you
till
i
had
made
more
money
out
of
you
neither
prone
in
another
ditch
he
had
changed
his
ditch
as
his
man
had
changed
his
position
and
holding
apart
so
small
a
patch
of
the
hedge
that
the
sharpest
eyes
could
not
have
detected
him
rogue
riderhood
watched
the
bather
dressing
and
now
gradually
came
the
wonder
that
he
stood
up
completely
clothed
another
man
and
not
the
bargeman
said
riderhood
as
you
was
dressed
that
night
i
see
you
a
taking
me
with
you
now
you
deep
but
i
knows
a
deeper
when
the
bather
had
finished
dressing
he
kneeled
on
the
grass
doing
something
with
his
hands
and
again
stood
up
with
his
bundle
under
his
arm
looking
all
around
him
with
great
attention
he
then
went
to
the
river
edge
and
flung
it
in
as
far
and
yet
as
lightly
as
he
could
it
was
not
until
he
was
so
decidedly
upon
his
way
again
as
to
be
beyond
a
bend
of
the
river
and
for
the
time
out
of
view
that
riderhood
scrambled
from
the
ditch
was
his
debate
with
himself
i
foller
you
on
or
shall
i
let
you
loose
for
this
once
and
go
a
fishing
the
debate
continuing
he
followed
as
a
precautionary
measure
in
any
case
and
got
him
again
in
sight
i
was
to
let
you
loose
this
once
said
riderhood
then
still
following
could
make
you
come
to
me
agin
or
i
could
find
you
out
in
one
way
or
another
if
i
was
to
go
a
fishing
others
i
let
you
loose
this
once
and
go
a
fishing
with
that
he
suddenly
dropped
the
pursuit
and
turned
the
miserable
man
whom
he
had
released
for
the
time
but
not
for
long
went
on
towards
london
bradley
was
suspicious
of
every
sound
he
heard
and
of
every
face
he
saw
but
was
under
a
spell
which
very
commonly
falls
upon
the
shedder
of
blood
and
had
no
suspicion
of
the
real
danger
that
lurked
in
his
life
and
would
have
it
yet
riderhood
was
much
in
his
thoughts
had
never
been
out
of
his
thoughts
since
the
of
their
first
meeting
but
riderhood
occupied
a
very
different
place
there
from
the
place
of
pursuer
and
bradley
had
been
at
the
pains
of
devising
so
many
means
of
fitting
that
place
to
him
and
of
wedging
him
into
it
that
his
mind
could
not
compass
the
possibility
of
his
occupying
any
other
and
this
is
another
spell
against
which
the
shedder
of
blood
for
ever
strives
in
vain
there
are
fifty
doors
by
which
discovery
may
enter
with
infinite
pains
and
cunning
he
double
locks
and
bars
of
them
and
can
not
see
the
fiftieth
standing
wide
open
now
too
was
he
cursed
with
a
state
of
mind
more
wearing
and
more
wearisome
than
remorse
he
had
no
remorse
but
the
evildoer
who
can
hold
that
avenger
at
bay
can
not
escape
the
slower
torture
of
incessantly
doing
the
evil
deed
again
and
doing
it
more
efficiently
in
the
defensive
declarations
and
pretended
confessions
of
murderers
the
pursuing
shadow
of
this
torture
may
be
traced
through
every
lie
they
tell
if
i
had
done
it
as
alleged
is
it
conceivable
that
i
would
have
made
this
and
this
mistake
if
i
had
done
it
as
alleged
should
i
have
left
that
unguarded
place
which
that
false
and
wicked
witness
against
me
so
infamously
deposed
to
the
state
of
that
wretch
who
continually
finds
the
weak
spots
in
his
own
crime
and
strives
to
strengthen
them
when
it
is
unchangeable
is
a
state
that
aggravates
the
offence
by
doing
the
deed
a
thousand
times
instead
of
once
but
it
is
a
state
too
that
tauntingly
visits
the
offence
upon
a
sullen
unrepentant
nature
with
its
heaviest
punishment
every
time
bradley
toiled
on
chained
heavily
to
the
idea
of
his
hatred
and
his
vengeance
and
thinking
how
he
might
have
satiated
both
in
many
better
ways
than
the
way
he
had
taken
the
instrument
might
have
been
better
the
spot
and
the
hour
might
have
been
better
chosen
to
batter
a
man
down
from
behind
in
the
dark
on
the
brink
of
a
river
was
well
enough
but
he
ought
to
have
been
instantly
disabled
whereas
he
had
turned
and
seized
his
assailant
and
so
to
end
it
before
came
and
to
be
rid
of
him
he
had
been
hurriedly
thrown
backward
into
the
river
before
the
life
was
fully
beaten
out
of
him
now
if
it
could
be
done
again
it
must
not
be
so
done
supposing
his
head
had
been
held
down
under
water
for
a
while
supposing
the
first
blow
had
been
truer
supposing
he
had
been
shot
supposing
he
had
been
strangled
suppose
this
way
that
way
the
other
way
suppose
anything
but
getting
unchained
from
the
one
idea
for
that
was
inexorably
impossible
the
school
reopened
next
day
the
scholars
saw
little
or
no
change
in
their
master
face
for
it
always
wore
its
slowly
labouring
expression
but
as
he
heard
his
classes
he
was
always
doing
the
deed
and
doing
it
better
as
he
paused
with
his
piece
of
chalk
at
the
black
board
before
writing
on
it
he
was
thinking
of
the
spot
and
whether
the
water
was
not
deeper
and
the
fall
straighter
a
little
higher
up
or
a
little
lower
down
he
had
half
a
mind
to
draw
a
line
or
two
upon
the
board
and
show
himself
what
he
meant
he
was
doing
it
again
and
improving
on
the
manner
at
prayers
in
his
mental
arithmetic
all
through
his
questioning
all
through
the
day
charley
hexam
was
a
master
now
in
another
school
under
another
head
it
was
evening
and
bradley
was
walking
in
his
garden
observed
from
behind
a
blind
by
gentle
little
miss
peecher
who
contemplated
offering
him
a
loan
of
her
smelling
salts
for
headache
when
mary
anne
in
faithful
attendance
held
up
her
arm
mary
anne
mr
hexam
if
you
please
coming
to
see
mr
headstone
good
mary
anne
again
mary
anne
held
up
her
arm
may
speak
mary
anne
headstone
has
beckoned
young
mr
hexam
into
his
house
and
he
has
gone
in
himself
without
waiting
for
young
mr
hexam
to
come
up
and
now
he
has
gone
in
too
and
has
shut
the
door
all
my
heart
mary
anne
again
mary
anne
telegraphic
arm
worked
more
mary
anne
must
find
it
rather
dull
and
dark
miss
peecher
for
the
parlour
blind
down
and
neither
of
them
pulls
it
up
is
no
accounting
said
good
miss
peecher
with
a
little
sad
sigh
which
she
repressed
by
laying
her
hand
on
her
neat
methodical
boddice
is
no
accounting
for
tastes
mary
anne
charley
entering
the
dark
room
stopped
short
when
he
saw
his
old
friend
in
its
yellow
shade
in
hexam
come
in
charley
advanced
to
take
the
hand
that
was
held
out
to
him
but
stopped
again
short
of
it
the
heavy
bloodshot
eyes
of
the
schoolmaster
rising
to
his
face
with
an
effort
met
his
look
of
scrutiny
headstone
what
the
matter
where
headstone
have
you
heard
the
news
this
news
about
the
fellow
mr
eugene
wrayburn
that
he
is
killed
is
dead
then
exclaimed
bradley
young
hexam
standing
looking
at
him
he
moistened
his
lips
with
his
tongue
looked
about
the
room
glanced
at
his
former
pupil
and
looked
down
heard
of
the
outrage
said
bradley
trying
to
constrain
his
working
mouth
i
had
not
heard
the
end
of
it
were
you
said
the
boy
advancing
a
step
as
he
lowered
his
voice
it
was
done
stop
i
do
ask
that
do
tell
me
if
you
force
your
confidence
upon
me
mr
headstone
i
give
up
every
word
of
it
mind
take
notice
i
give
up
it
and
i
give
up
you
i
will
the
wretched
creature
seemed
to
suffer
acutely
under
this
renunciation
a
desolate
air
of
utter
and
complete
loneliness
fell
upon
him
like
a
visible
shade
for
me
to
speak
not
you
said
the
boy
you
do
you
do
it
at
your
peril
i
am
going
to
put
your
selfishness
before
you
mr
headstone
your
passionate
violent
and
ungovernable
selfishness
to
show
you
why
i
can
and
why
i
will
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
he
looked
at
young
hexam
as
if
he
were
waiting
for
a
scholar
to
go
on
with
a
lesson
that
he
knew
by
heart
and
was
deadly
tired
of
but
he
had
said
his
last
word
to
him
you
had
any
part
i
do
say
what
in
this
attack
pursued
the
boy
if
you
know
anything
about
it
i
do
say
how
much
or
if
you
know
who
did
it
i
go
no
closer
you
did
an
injury
to
me
that
never
to
be
forgiven
you
know
that
i
took
you
with
me
to
his
chambers
in
the
temple
when
i
told
him
my
opinion
of
him
and
made
myself
responsible
for
my
opinion
of
you
you
know
that
i
took
you
with
me
when
i
was
watching
him
with
a
view
to
recovering
my
sister
and
bringing
her
to
her
senses
you
know
that
i
have
allowed
myself
to
be
mixed
up
with
you
all
through
this
business
in
favouring
your
desire
to
marry
my
sister
and
how
do
you
know
that
pursuing
the
ends
of
your
own
violent
temper
you
have
not
laid
me
open
to
suspicion
is
that
your
gratitude
to
me
mr
headstone
bradley
sat
looking
steadily
before
him
at
the
vacant
air
as
often
as
young
hexam
stopped
he
turned
his
eyes
towards
him
as
if
he
were
waiting
for
him
to
go
on
with
the
lesson
and
get
it
done
as
often
as
the
boy
resumed
bradley
resumed
his
fixed
face
am
going
to
be
plain
with
you
mr
headstone
said
young
hexam
shaking
his
head
in
a
manner
this
is
no
time
for
affecting
not
to
know
things
that
i
do
know
except
certain
things
at
which
it
might
not
be
very
safe
for
you
to
hint
again
what
i
mean
is
this
if
you
were
a
good
master
i
was
a
good
pupil
i
have
done
you
plenty
of
credit
and
in
improving
my
own
reputation
i
have
improved
yours
quite
as
much
very
well
then
starting
on
equal
terms
i
want
to
put
before
you
how
you
have
shown
your
gratitude
to
me
for
doing
all
i
could
to
further
your
wishes
with
reference
to
my
sister
you
have
compromised
me
by
being
seen
about
with
me
endeavouring
to
counteract
this
mr
eugene
wrayburn
that
the
first
thing
you
have
done
if
my
character
and
my
now
dropping
you
help
me
out
of
that
mr
headstone
the
deliverance
is
to
be
attributed
to
me
and
not
to
you
no
thanks
to
you
for
it
the
boy
stopping
again
he
moved
his
eyes
again
am
going
on
mr
headstone
do
you
be
afraid
i
am
going
on
to
the
end
and
i
have
told
you
beforehand
what
the
end
is
now
you
know
my
story
you
are
as
well
aware
as
i
am
that
i
have
had
many
disadvantages
to
leave
behind
me
in
life
you
have
heard
me
mention
my
father
and
you
are
sufficiently
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
the
home
from
which
i
as
i
may
say
escaped
might
have
been
a
more
creditable
one
than
it
was
my
father
died
and
then
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
my
way
to
respectability
was
pretty
clear
no
for
then
my
sister
begins
he
spoke
as
confidently
and
with
as
entire
an
absence
of
any
colour
in
his
cheek
as
if
there
were
no
softening
old
time
behind
him
not
wonderful
for
there
was
none
in
his
hollow
empty
heart
what
is
there
but
self
for
selfishness
to
see
behind
it
i
speak
of
my
sister
i
devoutly
wish
that
you
had
never
seen
her
mr
headstone
however
you
did
see
her
and
that
useless
now
i
confided
in
you
about
her
i
explained
her
character
to
you
and
how
she
interposed
some
ridiculous
fanciful
notions
in
the
way
of
our
being
as
respectable
as
i
tried
for
you
fell
in
love
with
her
and
i
favoured
you
with
all
my
might
she
could
not
be
induced
to
favour
you
and
so
we
came
into
collision
with
this
mr
eugene
wrayburn
now
what
have
you
done
why
you
have
justified
my
sister
in
being
firmly
set
against
you
from
first
to
last
and
you
have
put
me
in
the
wrong
again
and
why
have
you
done
it
because
mr
headstone
you
are
in
all
your
passions
so
selfish
and
so
concentrated
upon
yourself
that
you
have
not
bestowed
one
proper
thought
on
me
the
cool
conviction
with
which
the
boy
took
up
and
held
his
position
could
have
been
derived
from
no
other
vice
in
human
nature
is
he
went
on
actually
with
tears
extraordinary
circumstance
attendant
on
my
life
that
every
effort
i
make
towards
perfect
respectability
is
impeded
by
somebody
else
through
no
fault
of
mine
not
content
with
doing
what
i
have
put
before
you
you
will
drag
my
name
into
notoriety
through
dragging
my
sister
which
you
are
pretty
sure
to
do
if
my
suspicions
have
any
foundation
at
all
and
the
worse
you
prove
to
be
the
harder
it
will
be
for
me
to
detach
myself
from
being
associated
with
you
in
people
minds
when
he
had
dried
his
eyes
and
heaved
a
sob
over
his
injuries
he
began
moving
towards
the
door
i
have
made
up
my
mind
that
i
will
become
respectable
in
the
scale
of
society
and
that
i
will
not
be
dragged
down
by
others
i
have
done
with
my
sister
as
well
as
with
you
since
she
cares
so
little
for
me
as
to
care
nothing
for
undermining
my
respectability
she
shall
go
her
way
and
i
will
go
mine
my
prospects
are
very
good
and
i
mean
to
follow
them
alone
mr
headstone
i
do
say
what
you
have
got
upon
your
conscience
for
i
do
know
whatever
lies
upon
it
i
hope
you
will
see
the
justice
of
keeping
wide
and
clear
of
me
and
will
find
a
consolation
in
completely
exonerating
all
but
yourself
i
hope
before
many
years
are
out
to
succeed
the
master
in
my
present
school
and
the
mistress
being
a
single
woman
though
some
years
older
than
i
am
i
might
even
marry
her
if
it
is
any
comfort
to
you
to
know
what
plans
i
may
work
out
by
keeping
myself
strictly
respectable
in
the
scale
of
society
these
are
the
plans
at
present
occurring
to
me
in
conclusion
if
you
feel
a
sense
of
having
injured
me
and
a
desire
to
make
some
small
reparation
i
hope
you
will
think
how
respectable
you
might
have
been
yourself
and
will
contemplate
your
blighted
existence
was
it
strange
that
the
wretched
man
should
take
this
heavily
to
heart
perhaps
he
had
taken
the
boy
to
heart
first
through
some
long
laborious
years
perhaps
through
the
same
years
he
had
found
his
drudgery
lightened
by
communication
with
a
brighter
and
more
apprehensive
spirit
than
his
own
perhaps
a
family
resemblance
of
face
and
voice
between
the
boy
and
his
sister
smote
him
hard
in
the
gloom
of
his
fallen
state
for
whichsoever
reason
or
for
all
he
drooped
his
devoted
head
when
the
boy
was
gone
and
shrank
together
on
the
floor
and
grovelled
there
with
the
palms
of
his
hands
his
hot
temples
in
unutterable
misery
and
unrelieved
by
a
single
tear
rogue
riderhood
had
been
busy
with
the
river
that
day
he
had
fished
with
assiduity
on
the
previous
evening
but
the
light
was
short
and
he
had
fished
unsuccessfully
he
had
fished
again
that
day
with
better
luck
and
had
carried
his
fish
home
to
plashwater
weir
mill
in
a
bundle
chapter
a
few
grains
of
pepper
the
dolls
dressmaker
went
no
more
to
the
of
pubsey
and
in
st
mary
axe
after
chance
had
disclosed
to
her
as
she
supposed
the
flinty
and
hypocritical
character
of
mr
riah
she
often
moralized
over
her
work
on
the
tricks
and
the
manners
of
that
venerable
cheat
but
made
her
little
purchases
elsewhere
and
lived
a
secluded
life
after
much
consultation
with
herself
she
decided
not
to
put
lizzie
hexam
on
her
guard
against
the
old
man
arguing
that
the
disappointment
of
finding
him
out
would
come
upon
her
quite
soon
enough
therefore
in
her
communication
with
her
friend
by
letter
she
was
silent
on
this
theme
and
principally
dilated
on
the
backslidings
of
her
bad
child
who
every
day
grew
worse
and
worse
wicked
old
boy
miss
wren
would
say
to
him
with
a
menacing
forefinger
force
me
to
run
away
from
you
after
all
you
will
and
then
you
shake
to
bits
and
there
be
nobody
to
pick
up
the
pieces
at
this
foreshadowing
of
a
desolate
decease
the
wicked
old
boy
would
whine
and
whimper
and
would
sit
shaking
himself
into
the
lowest
of
low
spirits
until
such
time
as
he
could
shake
himself
out
of
the
house
and
shake
another
threepennyworth
into
himself
but
dead
drunk
or
dead
sober
he
had
come
to
such
a
pass
that
he
was
least
alive
in
the
latter
state
it
was
always
on
the
conscience
of
the
paralytic
scarecrow
that
he
had
betrayed
his
sharp
parent
for
sixty
threepennyworths
of
rum
which
were
all
gone
and
that
her
sharpness
would
infallibly
detect
his
having
done
it
sooner
or
later
all
things
considered
therefore
and
addition
made
of
the
state
of
his
body
to
the
state
of
his
mind
the
bed
on
which
mr
dolls
reposed
was
a
bed
of
roses
from
which
the
flowers
and
leaves
had
entirely
faded
leaving
him
to
lie
upon
the
thorns
and
stalks
on
a
certain
day
miss
wren
was
alone
at
her
work
with
the
set
open
for
coolness
and
was
trolling
in
a
small
sweet
voice
a
mournful
little
song
which
might
have
been
the
song
of
the
doll
she
was
dressing
bemoaning
the
brittleness
and
meltability
of
wax
when
whom
should
she
descry
standing
on
the
pavement
looking
in
at
her
but
mr
fledgeby
thought
it
was
you
said
fledgeby
coming
up
the
two
steps
you
miss
wren
retorted
i
thought
it
was
you
young
man
quite
a
coincidence
you
not
mistaken
and
i
not
mistaken
how
clever
we
are
and
how
are
you
said
fledgeby
am
pretty
much
as
usual
sir
replied
miss
wren
very
unfortunate
parent
worried
out
of
my
life
and
senses
by
a
very
bad
child
fledgeby
small
eyes
opened
so
wide
that
they
might
have
passed
for
eyes
as
he
stared
about
him
for
the
very
young
person
whom
he
supposed
to
be
in
question
you
not
a
parent
said
miss
wren
consequently
it
of
no
use
talking
to
you
upon
a
family
to
what
am
i
to
attribute
the
honour
and
favour
a
wish
to
improve
your
acquaintance
mr
fledgeby
replied
miss
wren
stopping
to
bite
her
thread
looked
at
him
very
knowingly
never
meet
now
said
fledgeby
we
said
miss
wren
chopping
off
the
word
i
had
a
mind
pursued
fledgeby
come
and
have
a
talk
with
you
about
our
dodging
friend
the
child
of
israel
he
gave
you
my
address
did
he
asked
miss
wren
got
it
out
of
him
said
fledgeby
with
a
stammer
seem
to
see
a
good
deal
of
him
remarked
miss
wren
with
shrewd
distrust
good
deal
of
him
you
seem
to
see
considering
i
do
said
fledgeby
you
inquired
the
dressmaker
bending
over
the
doll
on
which
her
art
was
being
exercised
interceding
with
him
yet
said
fledgeby
shaking
his
head
been
interceding
with
him
all
this
time
and
sticking
to
him
still
said
miss
wren
busy
with
her
work
to
him
is
the
word
said
fledgeby
miss
wren
pursued
her
occupation
with
a
concentrated
air
and
asked
after
an
interval
of
silent
industry
you
in
the
army
exactly
said
fledgeby
rather
flattered
by
the
question
asked
miss
wren
no
said
fledgeby
he
qualified
these
two
negatives
as
if
he
were
not
absolutely
in
either
service
but
was
almost
in
both
are
you
then
demanded
miss
wren
am
a
gentleman
i
am
said
fledgeby
assented
jenny
screwing
up
her
mouth
with
an
appearance
of
conviction
to
be
sure
that
accounts
for
your
having
so
much
time
to
give
to
interceding
but
only
to
think
how
kind
and
friendly
a
gentleman
you
must
be
mr
fledgeby
found
that
he
was
skating
round
a
board
marked
dangerous
and
had
better
cut
out
a
fresh
track
get
back
to
the
dodgerest
of
the
dodgers
said
he
he
up
to
in
the
case
of
your
friend
the
handsome
gal
he
must
have
some
object
what
his
object
can
not
undertake
to
say
sir
i
am
sure
returned
miss
wren
composedly
wo
acknowledge
where
she
gone
said
fledgeby
i
have
a
fancy
that
i
should
like
to
have
another
look
at
her
now
i
know
he
knows
where
she
is
gone
can
not
undertake
to
say
sir
i
am
sure
miss
wren
again
rejoined
you
know
where
she
is
gone
hazarded
fledgeby
can
not
undertake
to
say
sir
really
replied
miss
wren
the
quaint
little
chin
met
mr
fledgeby
gaze
with
such
a
baffling
hitch
that
that
agreeable
gentleman
was
for
some
time
at
a
loss
how
to
resume
his
fascinating
part
in
the
dialogue
at
length
he
said
jenny
that
your
name
if
i
do
mistake
you
do
mistake
sir
was
miss
wren
cool
answer
you
had
it
on
the
best
authority
mine
you
know
jenny
instead
of
coming
up
and
being
dead
let
come
out
and
look
alive
it
pay
better
i
assure
you
said
fledgeby
bestowing
an
inveigling
twinkle
or
two
upon
the
dressmaker
find
it
pay
better
said
miss
jenny
holding
out
her
doll
at
arm
length
and
critically
contemplating
the
effect
of
her
art
with
her
scissors
on
her
lips
and
her
head
thrown
back
as
if
her
interest
lay
there
and
not
in
the
conversation
you
explain
your
meaning
young
man
which
is
greek
to
you
must
have
another
touch
of
blue
in
your
trimming
my
dear
having
addressed
the
last
remark
to
her
fair
client
miss
wren
proceeded
to
snip
at
some
blue
fragments
that
lay
before
her
among
fragments
of
all
colours
and
to
thread
a
needle
from
a
skein
of
blue
silk
here
said
you
attending
am
attending
sir
replied
miss
wren
without
the
slightest
appearance
of
so
doing
touch
of
blue
in
your
trimming
my
dear
look
here
said
fledgeby
rather
discouraged
by
the
circumstances
under
which
he
found
himself
pursuing
the
conversation
you
attending
blue
my
sweet
young
lady
remarked
miss
wren
in
a
sprightly
tone
best
suited
to
your
fair
complexion
and
your
flaxen
curls
say
if
you
attending
proceeded
fledgeby
pay
better
in
this
way
it
lead
in
a
roundabout
manner
to
your
buying
damage
and
waste
of
pubsey
and
at
a
nominal
price
or
even
getting
it
for
nothing
thought
the
dressmaker
you
are
not
so
roundabout
little
eyes
that
i
do
notice
your
answering
for
pubsey
and
after
all
little
eyes
little
eyes
you
too
cunning
by
half
i
take
it
for
granted
pursued
fledgeby
to
get
the
most
of
your
materials
for
nothing
would
be
well
worth
your
while
miss
jenny
may
take
it
for
granted
returned
the
dressmaker
with
many
knowing
nods
it
always
well
worth
my
while
to
make
money
said
fledgeby
approvingly
answering
to
a
sensible
purpose
now
you
coming
out
and
looking
alive
so
i
make
so
free
miss
jenny
as
to
offer
the
remark
that
you
and
judah
were
too
thick
together
to
last
you
ca
come
to
be
intimate
with
such
a
deep
file
as
judah
without
beginning
to
see
a
little
way
into
him
you
know
said
fledgeby
with
a
wink
must
own
returned
the
dressmaker
with
her
eyes
upon
her
work
we
are
not
good
friends
at
present
know
you
not
good
friends
at
present
said
fledgeby
know
all
about
it
i
should
like
to
pay
off
judah
by
not
letting
him
have
his
own
deep
way
in
everything
in
most
things
he
get
it
by
hook
or
by
crook
but
hang
it
all
do
let
him
have
his
own
deep
way
in
everything
that
too
much
mr
fledgeby
said
this
with
some
display
of
indignant
warmth
as
if
he
was
counsel
in
the
cause
for
virtue
can
i
prevent
his
having
his
own
way
began
the
dressmaker
way
i
called
it
said
his
own
deep
way
in
anything
tell
you
said
fledgeby
like
to
hear
you
ask
it
because
it
looking
alive
it
what
i
should
expect
to
find
in
one
of
your
sagacious
understanding
now
candidly
cried
miss
jenny
said
now
candidly
mr
fledgeby
explained
a
little
put
out
should
be
glad
to
countermine
him
respecting
the
handsome
gal
your
friend
he
means
something
there
you
may
depend
upon
it
judah
means
something
there
he
has
a
motive
and
of
course
his
motive
is
a
dark
motive
now
whatever
his
motive
is
it
necessary
to
his
motive
mr
fledgeby
constructive
powers
were
not
equal
to
the
avoidance
of
some
tautology
here
it
should
be
kept
from
me
what
he
has
done
with
her
so
i
put
it
to
you
who
know
what
has
he
done
with
her
i
ask
no
more
and
is
that
asking
much
when
you
understand
that
it
will
pay
miss
jenny
wren
who
had
cast
her
eyes
upon
the
bench
again
after
her
last
interruption
sat
looking
at
it
needle
in
hand
but
not
working
for
some
moments
she
then
briskly
resumed
her
work
and
said
with
a
sidelong
glance
of
her
eyes
and
chin
at
mr
fledgeby
d
live
piccadilly
replied
fledgeby
are
you
at
home
you
like
said
jenny
in
her
abruptest
and
shortest
manner
better
time
in
the
day
said
fledgeby
look
in
upon
you
young
man
those
two
ladies
pointing
to
dolls
an
appointment
in
bond
street
at
ten
precisely
when
i
dropped
there
i
drive
round
to
you
with
a
weird
little
laugh
miss
jenny
pointed
to
her
as
her
equipage
is
looking
alive
indeed
cried
fledgeby
rising
you
i
promise
you
nothing
said
the
dolls
dressmaker
dabbing
two
dabs
at
him
with
her
needle
as
if
she
put
out
both
his
eyes
no
i
understand
returned
fledgeby
damage
and
waste
question
shall
be
settled
first
it
shall
be
made
to
pay
do
you
be
afraid
miss
jenny
young
man
mr
fledgeby
prepossessing
form
withdrew
itself
and
the
little
dressmaker
clipping
and
snipping
and
stitching
and
stitching
and
snipping
and
clipping
fell
to
work
at
a
great
rate
musing
and
muttering
all
the
time
misty
misty
ca
make
it
out
little
eyes
and
the
wolf
in
a
conspiracy
or
little
eyes
and
the
wolf
against
one
another
ca
make
it
out
my
poor
lizzie
have
they
both
designs
against
you
either
way
ca
make
it
out
is

and
the

co
ca

true
to

and
co
to

pubsey
false

and
co
to

ca
make
it
out
what
said
little
eyes
now
candidly
ah
however
the
cat
jumps
he
a
liar
that
all
i
can
make
out
at
present
but
you
may
go
to
bed
in
the
albany
piccadilly
with
that
for
your
pillow
young
man
thereupon
the
little
dressmaker
again
dabbed
out
his
eyes
separately
and
making
a
loop
in
the
air
of
her
thread
and
deftly
catching
it
into
a
knot
with
her
needle
seemed
to
bowstring
him
into
the
bargain
for
the
terrors
undergone
by
mr
dolls
that
evening
when
his
little
parent
sat
profoundly
meditating
over
her
work
and
when
he
imagined
himself
found
out
as
often
as
she
changed
her
attitude
or
turned
her
eyes
towards
him
there
is
no
adequate
name
moreover
it
was
her
habit
to
shake
her
head
at
that
wretched
old
boy
whenever
she
caught
his
eye
as
he
shivered
and
shook
what
are
popularly
called
trembles
being
in
full
force
upon
him
that
evening
and
likewise
what
are
popularly
called
horrors
he
had
a
very
bad
time
of
it
which
was
not
made
better
by
his
being
so
remorseful
as
frequently
to
moan
threepennorths
this
imperfect
sentence
not
being
at
all
intelligible
as
a
confession
but
sounding
like
a
gargantuan
order
for
a
dram
brought
him
into
new
difficulties
by
occasioning
his
parent
to
pounce
at
him
in
a
more
than
usually
snappish
manner
and
to
overwhelm
him
with
bitter
reproaches
what
was
a
bad
time
for
mr
dolls
could
not
fail
to
be
a
bad
time
for
the
dolls
dressmaker
however
she
was
on
the
alert
next
morning
and
drove
to
bond
street
and
set
down
the
two
ladies
punctually
and
then
directed
her
equipage
to
conduct
her
to
the
albany
arrived
at
the
doorway
of
the
house
in
which
mr
fledgeby
chambers
were
she
found
a
lady
standing
there
in
a
travelling
dress
holding
in
her
hand
of
all
things
in
the
world
a
gentleman
hat
want
some
one
said
the
lady
in
a
stern
manner
am
going
up
stairs
to
mr
fledgeby
can
not
do
that
at
this
moment
there
is
a
gentleman
with
him
i
am
waiting
for
the
gentleman
his
business
with
mr
fledgeby
will
very
soon
be
transacted
and
then
you
can
go
up
until
the
gentleman
comes
down
you
must
wait
here
while
speaking
and
afterwards
the
lady
kept
watchfully
between
her
and
the
staircase
as
if
prepared
to
oppose
her
going
up
by
force
the
lady
being
of
a
stature
to
stop
her
with
a
hand
and
looking
mightily
determined
the
dressmaker
stood
still
why
do
you
listen
asked
the
lady
am
not
listening
said
the
dressmaker
do
you
hear
asked
the
lady
altering
her
phrase
it
a
kind
of
a
spluttering
somewhere
said
the
dressmaker
with
an
inquiring
look
fledgeby
in
his
perhaps
remarked
the
lady
smiling
somebody
beating
a
carpet
i
think
fledgeby
carpet
i
dare
say
replied
the
smiling
lady
miss
wren
had
a
reasonably
good
eye
for
smiles
being
well
accustomed
to
them
on
the
part
of
her
young
friends
though
their
smiles
mostly
ran
smaller
than
in
nature
but
she
had
never
seen
so
singular
a
smile
as
that
upon
this
lady
face
it
twitched
her
nostrils
open
in
a
remarkable
manner
and
contracted
her
lips
and
eyebrows
it
was
a
smile
of
enjoyment
too
though
of
such
a
fierce
kind
that
miss
wren
thought
she
would
rather
not
enjoy
herself
than
do
it
in
that
way
said
the
lady
watching
her
now
hope
there
nothing
the
matter
said
the
dressmaker
inquired
the
lady
do
know
where
said
miss
wren
staring
about
her
i
never
heard
such
odd
noises
do
you
think
i
had
better
call
somebody
think
you
had
better
not
returned
the
lady
with
a
significant
frown
and
drawing
closer
on
this
hint
the
dressmaker
relinquished
the
idea
and
stood
looking
at
the
lady
as
hard
as
the
lady
looked
at
her
meanwhile
the
dressmaker
listened
with
amazement
to
the
odd
noises
which
still
continued
and
the
lady
listened
too
but
with
a
coolness
in
which
there
was
no
trace
of
amazement
soon
afterwards
came
a
slamming
and
banging
of
doors
and
then
came
running
down
stairs
a
gentleman
with
whiskers
and
out
of
breath
who
seemed
to
be
your
business
done
alfred
inquired
the
lady
thoroughly
done
replied
the
gentleman
as
he
took
his
hat
from
her
can
go
up
to
mr
fledgeby
as
soon
as
you
like
said
the
lady
moving
haughtily
away
and
you
can
take
these
three
pieces
of
stick
with
you
added
the
gentleman
politely
say
if
you
please
that
they
come
from
mr
alfred
lammle
with
his
compliments
on
leaving
england
mr
alfred
lammle
be
so
good
as
not
to
forget
the
name
the
three
pieces
of
stick
were
three
broken
and
frayed
fragments
of
a
stout
lithe
cane
miss
jenny
taking
them
wonderingly
and
the
gentleman
repeating
with
a
grin
alfred
lammle
if
you
be
so
good
compliments
on
leaving
england
the
lady
and
gentleman
walked
away
quite
deliberately
and
miss
jenny
and
her
went
up
stairs
lammle
lammle
miss
jenny
repeated
as
she
panted
from
stair
to
stair
have
i
heard
that
name
lammle
lammle
i
know
saint
mary
axe
with
a
gleam
of
new
intelligence
in
her
sharp
face
the
dressmaker
pulled
at
fledgeby
bell
no
one
answered
but
from
within
the
chambers
there
proceeded
a
continuous
spluttering
sound
of
a
highly
singular
and
unintelligible
nature
gracious
is
little
eyes
choking
cried
miss
jenny
pulling
at
the
bell
again
and
getting
no
reply
she
pushed
the
outer
door
and
found
it
standing
ajar
no
one
being
visible
on
her
opening
it
wider
and
the
spluttering
continuing
she
took
the
liberty
of
opening
an
inner
door
and
then
beheld
the
extraordinary
spectacle
of
mr
fledgeby
in
a
shirt
a
pair
of
turkish
trousers
and
a
turkish
cap
rolling
over
and
over
on
his
own
carpet
and
spluttering
wonderfully
lord
gasped
mr
fledgeby
my
eye
stop
thief
i
am
strangling

eye

glass
of
water

a

every
mortal
disease
incidental

so
sore
cried
fledgeby
starting
over
on
his
back
in
a
spasmodic
way
that

the
wall

he
rolled
himself
into
a
corner
with
his
turkish

and
then
resolving
in
the
first
place
to
address
her
ministration
to
the
salt

snuff
gave
him
more
water
and
slapped
his
back
but
the
latter
application
was
by
no

a
success

mr
fledgeby
to
scream
and
to
cry
out

eye

covered

however
he
gradually
ceased

choke
and
crow
saving
at
intervals
and
miss

got
him
into
an
where
with
his
eyes
red
and
watery
with
his
features
swollen
and
with
some
livid
bars
across
his
face
he
presented
a
most
rueful
sight

said
it
with
such
spiteful
satisfaction
and
such
a
hitch
of
her
chin
and
eyes
as
might
have
added
to
mr
fledgeby
miseries
if

in
testimony
of
the
extent
to

he
smarted
mr
fledgeby
came
wallowing
out
of
the
and
took
another
roll
on
the
carpet
the
door
shut
said
mr
fledgeby
sitting
up
in
anguish
with
his
turkish
cap
half
on
and
half
off
and
the
bars
on
his
face
getting
bluer
me
the
kindness
to
look
at
my
back
and
shoulders
they
must
be
in
an
awful
state
for
i
had
got
my
on
when
the
brute
came
rushing
in
cut
my
shirt
away
from
the
collar
there
a
pair
of
scissors
on
that
table
oh
groaned
mr
fledgeby
with
his
hand
to
his
head
again
i
do
smart
to
be
sure
inquired
miss
jenny
alluding
to
the
back
and
shoulders
lord
yes
moaned
fledgeby
rocking
himself
all
over
everywhere
the
busy
little
dressmaker
quickly
snipped
the
shirt
away
and
laid
bare
the
results
of
as
furious
and
sound
a
thrashing
as
even
mr
fledgeby
merited
may
well
smart
young
man
exclaimed
miss
jenny
and
stealthily
rubbed
her
little
hands
behind
him
and
poked
a
few
exultant
pokes
with
her
two
forefingers
over
the
crown
of
his
head
do
you
think
of
vinegar
and
brown
paper
inquired
the
suffering
fledgeby
still
rocking
and
moaning
it
look
as
if
vinegar
and
brown
paper
was
the
sort
of
application
said
miss
jenny
with
a
silent
chuckle
looks
as
if
it
ought
to
be
pickled
mr
fledgeby
collapsed
under
the
word
and
groaned
again
kitchen
is
on
this
floor
he
said
find
brown
paper
in
a
there
and
a
bottle
of
vinegar
on
a
shelf
would
you
have
the
kindness
to
make
a
few
plasters
and
put
on
it
ca
be
kept
too
quiet

said
the
smart
enough
whimpered
mr
fledgeby
groaning
and
writhing
again
sixty
miss
jenny
repaired
to
the
kitchen
scissors
in
hand
found
the
brown
paper
and
found
the
vinegar
and
skilfully
cut
out
and
steeped
six
large
plasters
when
they
were
all
lying
ready
on
the
dresser
an
idea
occurred
to
her
as
she
was
about
to
gather
them
up
think
said
miss
jenny
with
a
silent
laugh
ought
to
have
a
little
pepper
just
a
few
grains
i
think
the
young
man
tricks
and
manners
make
a
claim
upon
his
friends
for
a
little
pepper
mr
fledgeby
evil
star
showing
her
the
on
the
chimneypiece
she
climbed
upon
a
chair
and
got
it
down
and
sprinkled
all
the
plasters
with
a
judicious
hand
she
then
went
back
to
mr
fledgeby
and
stuck
them
all
on
him
mr
fledgeby
uttering
a
sharp
howl
as
each
was
put
in
its
place
young
man
said
the
dolls
dressmaker
i
hope
you
feel
pretty
comfortable
apparently
mr
fledgeby
did
not
for
he
cried
by
way
of
answer
h
how
i
do
smart
miss
jenny
got
his
persian
gown
upon
him
extinguished
his
eyes
crookedly
with
his
persian
cap
and
helped
him
to
his
bed
upon
which
he
climbed
groaning
between
you
and
me
being
out
of
the
question
young
man
and
my
time
being
precious
said
miss
jenny
then
make
myself
scarce
are
you
comfortable
now
my
eye
cried
mr
fledgeby
i
ai
oh
h
h
how
i
do
smart
the
last
thing
miss
jenny
saw
as
she
looked
back
before
closing
the
room
door
was
mr
fledgeby
in
the
act
of
plunging
and
gambolling
all
over
his
bed
like
a
porpoise
or
dolphin
in
its
native
element
she
then
shut
the
bedroom
door
and
all
the
other
doors
and
going
down
stairs
and
emerging
from
the
albany
into
the
busy
streets
took
omnibus
for
saint
mary
axe
pressing
on
the
road
all
the
ladies
whom
she
could
see
from
the
window
and
making
them
unconscious
for
dolls
while
she
mentally
cut
them
out
and
basted
them
chapter
two
places
vacated
set
down
by
the
omnibus
at
the
corner
of
saint
mary
axe
and
trusting
to
her
feet
and
her
within
its
precincts
the
dressmaker
proceeded
to
the
place
of
business
of
pubsey
and
all
there
was
sunny
and
quiet
externally
and
shady
and
quiet
internally
hiding
herself
in
the
entry
outside
the
glass
door
she
could
see
from
that
post
of
observation
the
old
man
in
his
spectacles
sitting
writing
at
his
desk
cried
the
dressmaker
popping
in
her
head
at
the
wolf
at
home
the
old
man
took
his
glasses
off
and
mildly
laid
them
down
beside
him
jenny
is
it
you
i
thought
you
had
given
me
up
so
i
had
given
up
the
treacherous
wolf
of
the
forest
she
replied
godmother
it
strikes
me
you
have
come
back
i
am
not
quite
sure
because
the
wolf
and
you
change
forms
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
or
two
to
find
out
whether
you
are
really
godmother
or
really
wolf
may
i
jenny
yes
but
riah
glanced
towards
the
door
as
if
he
thought
his
principal
might
appear
there
unseasonably
you
afraid
of
the
fox
said
miss
jenny
may
dismiss
all
present
expectations
of
seeing
that
animal
he
wo
show
himself
abroad
for
many
a
day
do
you
mean
my
child
mean
godmother
replied
miss
wren
sitting
down
beside
the
jew
the
fox
has
caught
a
famous
flogging
and
that
if
his
skin
and
bones
are
not
tingling
aching
and
smarting
at
this
present
instant
no
fox
did
ever
tingle
ache
and
smart
therewith
miss
jenny
related
what
had
come
to
pass
in
the
albany
omitting
the
few
grains
of
pepper
godmother
she
went
on
particularly
wish
to
ask
you
what
has
taken
place
here
since
i
left
the
wolf
here
because
i
have
an
idea
about
the
size
of
a
marble
rolling
about
in
my
little
noddle
first
and
foremost
are
you
pubsey
and
or
are
you
either
upon
your
solemn
word
and
honour
the
old
man
shook
his
head
is
fledgeby
both
pubsey
and
the
old
man
answered
with
a
reluctant
nod
idea
exclaimed
miss
wren
now
about
the
size
of
an
orange
but
before
it
gets
any
bigger
welcome
back
dear
godmother
the
little
creature
folded
her
arms
about
the
old
man
neck
with
great
earnestness
and
kissed
him
humbly
beg
your
forgiveness
godmother
i
am
truly
sorry
i
ought
to
have
had
more
faith
in
you
but
what
could
i
suppose
when
you
said
nothing
for
yourself
you
know
i
do
mean
to
offer
that
as
a
justification
but
what
could
i
suppose
when
you
were
a
silent
party
to
all
he
said
it
did
look
bad
now
did
it
looked
so
bad
jenny
responded
the
old
man
with
gravity
i
will
straightway
tell
you
what
an
impression
it
wrought
upon
me
i
was
hateful
in
mine
own
eyes
i
was
hateful
to
myself
in
being
so
hateful
to
the
debtor
and
to
you
but
more
than
that
and
worse
than
that
and
to
pass
out
far
and
broad
beyond
myself
i
reflected
that
evening
sitting
alone
in
my
garden
on
the
housetop
that
i
was
doing
dishonour
to
my
ancient
faith
and
race
i
reflected
clearly
reflected
for
the
first
time
that
in
bending
my
neck
to
the
yoke
i
was
willing
to
wear
i
bent
the
unwilling
necks
of
the
whole
jewish
people
for
it
is
not
in
christian
countries
with
the
jews
as
with
other
peoples
men
say
is
a
bad
greek
but
there
are
good
greeks
this
is
a
bad
turk
but
there
are
good
turks
not
so
with
the
jews
men
find
the
bad
among
us
easily
enough
among
what
peoples
are
the
bad
not
easily
found
but
they
take
the
worst
of
us
as
samples
of
the
best
they
take
the
lowest
of
us
as
presentations
of
the
highest
and
they
say
all
jews
are
if
doing
what
i
was
content
to
do
here
because
i
was
grateful
for
the
past
and
have
small
need
of
money
now
i
had
been
a
christian
i
could
have
done
it
compromising
no
one
but
my
individual
self
but
doing
it
as
a
jew
i
could
not
choose
but
compromise
the
jews
of
all
conditions
and
all
countries
it
is
a
little
hard
upon
us
but
it
is
the
truth
i
would
that
all
our
people
remembered
it
though
i
have
little
right
to
say
so
seeing
that
it
came
home
so
late
to
me
the
dolls
dressmaker
sat
holding
the
old
man
by
the
hand
and
looking
thoughtfully
in
his
face
i
reflected
i
say
sitting
that
evening
in
my
garden
on
the
housetop
and
passing
the
painful
scene
of
that
day
in
review
before
me
many
times
i
always
saw
that
the
poor
gentleman
believed
the
story
readily
because
i
was
one
of
the
jews
that
you
believed
the
story
readily
my
child
because
i
was
one
of
the
jews
that
the
story
itself
first
came
into
the
invention
of
the
originator
thereof
because
i
was
one
of
the
jews
this
was
the
result
of
my
having
had
you
three
before
me
face
to
face
and
seeing
the
thing
visibly
presented
as
upon
a
theatre
wherefore
i
perceived
that
the
obligation
was
upon
me
to
leave
this
service
but
jenny
my
dear
said
riah
breaking
off
promised
that
you
should
pursue
your
questions
and
i
obstruct
them
the
contrary
godmother
my
idea
is
as
large
now
as
a
pumpkin
and
you
know
what
a
pumpkin
is
do
you
so
you
gave
notice
that
you
were
going
does
that
come
next
asked
miss
jenny
with
a
look
of
close
attention
indited
a
letter
to
my
master
yes
to
that
effect
what
said
asked
miss
wren
with
an
unspeakable
enjoyment
in
the
utterance
of
those
honourable
titles
and
in
the
recollection
of
the
pepper
held
me
to
certain
months
of
servitude
which
were
his
lawful
term
of
notice
they
expire
upon
their
expiration
not
before
i
had
meant
to
set
myself
right
with
my
cinderella
idea
is
getting
so
immense
now
cried
miss
wren
clasping
her
temples
my
head
wo
hold
it
listen
godmother
i
am
going
to
expound
little
eyes
that
owes
you
a
heavy
grudge
for
going
little
eyes
casts
about
how
best
to
pay
you
off
little
eyes
thinks
of
lizzie
little
eyes
says
to
himself
find
out
where
he
has
placed
that
girl
and
i
betray
his
secret
because
it
dear
to
him
perhaps
little
eyes
thinks
i
make
love
to
her
myself
too
but
that
i
ca
swear
all
the
rest
i
can
so
little
eyes
comes
to
me
and
i
go
to
little
eyes
that
the
way
of
it
and
now
the
murder
all
out
i
sorry
added
the
dolls
dressmaker
rigid
from
head
to
foot
with
energy
as
she
shook
her
little
fist
before
her
eyes
i
did
give
him
cayenne
pepper
and
chopped
pickled
capsicum
this
expression
of
regret
being
but
partially
intelligible
to
mr
riah
the
old
man
reverted
to
the
injuries
fledgeby
had
received
and
hinted
at
the
necessity
of
his
at
once
going
to
tend
that
beaten
cur
godmother
godmother
cried
miss
wren
irritably
really
lose
all
patience
with
you
one
would
think
you
believed
in
the
good
samaritan
how
can
you
be
so
inconsistent
dear
began
the
old
man
gently
is
the
custom
of
our
people
to
help
bother
your
people
interposed
miss
wren
with
a
toss
of
her
head
your
people
do
know
better
than
to
go
and
help
little
eyes
a
pity
they
ever
got
out
of
egypt
over
and
above
that
she
added
would
take
your
help
if
you
offered
it
too
much
ashamed
wants
to
keep
it
close
and
quiet
and
to
keep
you
out
of
the
way
they
were
still
debating
this
point
when
a
shadow
darkened
the
entry
and
the
glass
door
was
opened
by
a
messenger
who
brought
a
letter
unceremoniously
addressed
to
which
he
said
there
was
an
answer
wanted
the
letter
which
was
scrawled
in
pencil
uphill
and
downhill
and
round
crooked
corners
ran
thus
riah
your
accounts
being
all
squared
go
shut
up
the
place
turn
out
directly
and
send
me
the
key
by
bearer
go
you
are
an
unthankful
dog
of
a
jew
get
out
the
dolls
dressmaker
found
it
delicious
to
trace
the
screaming
and
smarting
of
little
eyes
in
the
distorted
writing
of
this
epistle
she
laughed
over
it
and
jeered
at
it
in
a
convenient
corner
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
messenger
while
the
old
man
got
his
few
goods
together
in
a
black
bag
that
done
the
shutters
of
the
upper
windows
closed
and
the
office
blind
pulled
down
they
issued
forth
upon
the
steps
with
the
attendant
messenger
there
while
miss
jenny
held
the
bag
the
old
man
locked
the
house
door
and
handed
over
the
key
to
him
who
at
once
retired
with
the
same
godmother
said
miss
wren
as
they
remained
upon
the
steps
together
looking
at
one
another
so
you
thrown
upon
the
world
would
appear
so
jenny
and
somewhat
suddenly
are
you
going
to
seek
your
fortune
asked
miss
wren
the
old
man
smiled
but
looked
about
him
with
a
look
of
having
lost
his
way
in
life
which
did
not
escape
the
dolls
dressmaker
jenny
said
he
question
is
to
the
purpose
and
more
easily
asked
than
answered
but
as
i
have
experience
of
the
ready
goodwill
and
good
help
of
those
who
have
given
occupation
to
lizzie
i
think
i
will
seek
them
out
for
myself
foot
asked
miss
wren
with
a
chop
said
the
old
man
i
not
my
staff
it
was
exactly
because
he
had
his
staff
and
presented
so
quaint
an
aspect
that
she
mistrusted
his
making
the
journey
best
thing
you
can
do
said
jenny
the
time
being
at
all
events
is
to
come
home
with
me
godmother
nobody
there
but
my
bad
child
and
lizzie
lodging
stands
empty
the
old
man
when
satisfied
that
no
inconvenience
could
be
entailed
on
any
one
by
his
compliance
readily
complied
and
the
couple
once
more
went
through
the
streets
together
now
the
bad
child
having
been
strictly
charged
by
his
parent
to
remain
at
home
in
her
absence
of
course
went
out
and
being
in
the
very
last
stage
of
mental
decrepitude
went
out
with
two
objects
firstly
to
establish
a
claim
he
conceived
himself
to
have
upon
any
licensed
victualler
living
to
be
supplied
with
threepennyworth
of
rum
for
nothing
and
secondly
to
bestow
some
maudlin
remorse
on
mr
eugene
wrayburn
and
see
what
profit
came
of
it
stumblingly
pursuing
these
two
designs
they
both
meant
rum
the
only
meaning
of
which
he
was
capable
the
degraded
creature
staggered
into
covent
garden
market
and
there
bivouacked
to
have
an
attack
of
the
trembles
succeeded
by
an
attack
of
the
horrors
in
a
doorway
this
market
of
covent
garden
was
quite
out
of
the
creature
line
of
road
but
it
had
the
attraction
for
him
which
it
has
for
the
worst
of
the
solitary
members
of
the
drunken
tribe
it
may
be
the
companionship
of
the
nightly
stir
or
it
may
be
the
companionship
of
the
gin
and
beer
that
slop
about
among
carters
and
hucksters
or
it
may
be
the
companionship
of
the
trodden
vegetable
refuse
which
is
so
like
their
own
dress
that
perhaps
they
take
the
market
for
a
great
wardrobe
but
be
it
what
it
may
you
shall
see
no
such
individual
drunkards
on
doorsteps
anywhere
as
there
of
dozing
especially
you
shall
come
upon
such
specimens
there
in
the
morning
sunlight
as
you
might
seek
out
of
doors
in
vain
through
london
such
stale
vapid
rejected
and
dress
such
countenance
such
squashed
pulp
of
humanity
are
open
to
the
day
nowhere
else
so
the
attraction
of
the
market
drew
mr
dolls
to
it
and
he
had
out
his
two
fits
of
trembles
and
horrors
in
a
doorway
on
which
a
woman
had
had
out
her
sodden
nap
a
few
hours
before
there
is
a
swarm
of
young
savages
always
flitting
about
this
same
place
creeping
off
with
fragments
of
and
mouldy
litter
heaven
knows
into
what
holes
they
can
convey
them
having
no
home
whose
bare
feet
fall
with
a
blunt
dull
softness
on
the
pavement
as
the
policeman
hunts
them
and
who
are
perhaps
for
that
reason
little
heard
by
the
powers
that
be
whereas
in
they
would
make
a
deafening
clatter
these
delighting
in
the
trembles
and
the
horrors
of
mr
dolls
as
in
a
gratuitous
drama
flocked
about
him
in
his
doorway
butted
at
him
leaped
at
him
and
pelted
him
hence
when
he
came
out
of
his
invalid
retirement
and
shook
off
that
ragged
train
he
was
much
bespattered
and
in
worse
case
than
ever
but
not
yet
at
his
worst
for
going
into
a
and
being
supplied
in
stress
of
business
with
his
rum
and
seeking
to
vanish
without
payment
he
was
collared
searched
found
penniless
and
admonished
not
to
try
that
again
by
having
a
pail
of
dirty
water
cast
over
him
this
application
superinduced
another
fit
of
the
trembles
after
which
mr
dolls
as
finding
himself
in
good
cue
for
making
a
call
on
a
professional
friend
addressed
himself
to
the
temple
there
was
nobody
at
the
chambers
but
young
blight
that
discreet
youth
sensible
of
a
certain
incongruity
in
the
association
of
such
a
client
with
the
business
that
might
be
coming
some
day
with
the
best
intentions
temporized
with
dolls
and
offered
a
shilling
for
home
mr
dolls
accepting
the
shilling
promptly
laid
it
out
in
two
threepennyworths
of
conspiracy
against
his
life
and
two
threepennyworths
of
raging
repentance
returning
to
the
chambers
with
which
burden
he
was
descried
coming
round
into
the
court
by
the
wary
young
blight
watching
from
the
window
who
instantly
closed
the
outer
door
and
left
the
miserable
object
to
expend
his
fury
on
the
panels
the
more
the
door
resisted
him
the
more
dangerous
and
imminent
became
that
bloody
conspiracy
against
his
life
force
of
police
arriving
he
recognized
in
them
the
conspirators
and
laid
about
him
hoarsely
fiercely
staringly
convulsively
foamingly
a
humble
machine
familiar
to
the
conspirators
and
called
by
the
expressive
name
of
stretcher
being
unavoidably
sent
for
he
was
rendered
a
harmless
bundle
of
torn
rags
by
being
strapped
down
upon
it
with
voice
and
consciousness
gone
out
of
him
and
life
fast
going
as
this
machine
was
borne
out
at
the
temple
gate
by
four
men
the
poor
little
dolls
dressmaker
and
her
jewish
friend
were
coming
up
the
street
us
see
what
it
is
cried
the
dressmaker
us
make
haste
and
look
godmother
the
brisk
little
was
but
too
brisk
gentlemen
gentlemen
he
belongs
to
me
to
you
said
the
head
of
the
party
stopping
it
yes
dear
gentlemen
he
my
child
out
without
leave
my
poor
bad
bad
boy
and
he
do
know
me
he
do
know
me
o
what
shall
i
do
cried
the
little
creature
wildly
beating
her
hands
together
my
own
child
do
know
me
the
head
of
the
party
looked
as
well
he
might
to
the
old
man
for
explanation
he
whispered
as
the
dolls
dressmaker
bent
over
the
exhausted
form
and
vainly
tried
to
extract
some
sign
of
recognition
from
it
her
drunken
father
as
the
load
was
put
down
in
the
street
riah
drew
the
head
of
the
party
aside
and
whispered
that
he
thought
the
man
was
dying
surely
not
returned
the
other
but
he
became
less
confident
on
looking
and
directed
the
bearers
to
him
to
the
nearest
doctor
shop
thither
he
was
brought
the
window
becoming
from
within
a
wall
of
faces
deformed
into
all
kinds
of
shapes
through
the
agency
of
globular
red
bottles
green
bottles
blue
bottles
and
other
coloured
bottles
a
ghastly
light
shining
upon
him
that
he
did
need
the
beast
so
furious
but
a
few
minutes
gone
was
quiet
enough
now
with
a
strange
mysterious
writing
on
his
face
reflected
from
one
of
the
great
bottles
as
if
death
had
marked
him
the
medical
testimony
was
more
precise
and
more
to
the
purpose
than
it
sometimes
is
in
a
court
of
justice
had
better
send
for
something
to
cover
it
all
over
therefore
the
police
sent
for
something
to
cover
it
and
it
was
covered
and
borne
through
the
streets
the
people
falling
away
after
it
went
the
dolls
dressmaker
hiding
her
face
in
the
jewish
skirts
and
clinging
to
them
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
she
plied
her
stick
it
was
carried
home
and
by
reason
that
the
staircase
was
very
narrow
it
was
put
down
in
the
parlour
the
little
being
set
aside
to
make
room
for
it
and
there
in
the
midst
of
the
dolls
with
no
speculation
in
their
eyes
lay
mr
dolls
with
no
speculation
in
his
many
flaunting
dolls
had
to
be
gaily
dressed
before
the
money
was
in
the
dressmaker
pocket
to
get
mourning
for
mr
dolls
as
the
old
man
riah
sat
by
helping
her
in
such
small
ways
as
he
could
he
found
it
difficult
to
make
out
whether
she
really
did
realize
that
the
deceased
had
been
her
father
my
poor
boy
she
would
say
been
brought
up
better
he
might
have
done
better
not
that
i
reproach
myself
i
hope
i
have
no
cause
for
that
indeed
jenny
i
am
very
certain
you
godmother
it
cheers
me
to
hear
you
say
so
but
you
see
it
is
so
hard
to
bring
up
a
child
well
when
you
work
work
work
all
day
when
he
was
out
of
employment
i
could
always
keep
him
near
me
he
got
fractious
and
nervous
and
i
was
obliged
to
let
him
go
into
the
streets
and
he
never
did
well
in
the
streets
he
never
did
well
out
of
sight
how
often
it
happens
with
children
often
even
in
this
sad
sense
thought
the
old
man
can
i
say
what
i
might
have
turned
out
myself
but
for
my
back
having
been
so
bad
and
my
legs
so
queer
when
i
was
young
the
dressmaker
would
go
on
had
nothing
to
do
but
work
and
so
i
worked
i
could
play
but
my
poor
unfortunate
child
could
play
and
it
turned
out
the
worse
for
him
not
for
him
alone
jenny
i
do
know
godmother
he
suffered
heavily
did
my
unfortunate
boy
he
was
very
very
ill
sometimes
and
i
called
him
a
quantity
of
names
shaking
her
head
over
her
work
and
dropping
tears
know
that
his
going
wrong
was
much
the
worse
for
me
if
it
ever
was
let
us
forget
it
are
a
good
girl
you
are
a
patient
girl
for
patience
she
would
reply
with
a
shrug
much
of
that
godmother
if
i
had
been
patient
i
should
never
have
called
him
names
but
i
hope
i
did
it
for
his
good
and
besides
i
felt
my
responsibility
as
a
mother
so
much
i
tried
reasoning
and
reasoning
failed
i
tried
coaxing
and
coaxing
failed
i
tried
scolding
and
scolding
failed
but
i
was
bound
to
try
everything
you
know
with
such
a
charge
upon
my
hands
where
would
have
been
my
duty
to
my
poor
lost
boy
if
i
had
not
tried
everything
with
such
talk
mostly
in
a
cheerful
tone
on
the
part
of
the
industrious
little
creature
the
and
the
were
beguiled
until
enough
of
smart
dolls
had
gone
forth
to
bring
into
the
kitchen
where
the
now
stood
the
sombre
stuff
that
the
occasion
required
and
to
bring
into
the
house
the
other
sombre
preparations
now
said
miss
jenny
knocked
off
my
young
friends
i
knock
off
my
self
this
referred
to
her
making
her
own
dress
which
at
last
was
done
disadvantage
of
making
for
yourself
said
miss
jenny
as
she
stood
upon
a
chair
to
look
at
the
result
in
the
glass
that
you
ca
charge
anybody
else
for
the
job
and
the
advantage
is
that
you
have
to
go
out
to
try
on
humph
very
fair
indeed
if
he
could
see
me
now
whoever
he
is
i
hope
he
would
repent
of
his
bargain
the
simple
arrangements
were
of
her
own
making
and
were
stated
to
riah
thus
mean
to
go
alone
godmother
in
my
usual
carriage
and
you
be
so
kind
as
keep
house
while
i
am
gone
it
not
far
off
and
when
i
return
we
have
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
chat
over
future
arrangements
it
a
very
plain
last
house
that
i
have
been
able
to
give
my
poor
unfortunate
boy
but
he
accept
the
will
for
the
deed
if
he
knows
anything
about
it
and
if
he
does
know
anything
about
it
with
a
sob
and
wiping
her
eyes
it
wo
matter
to
him
i
see
the
service
in
the
says
that
we
brought
nothing
into
this
world
and
it
is
certain
we
can
take
nothing
out
it
comforts
me
for
not
being
able
to
hire
a
lot
of
stupid
undertaker
things
for
my
poor
child
and
seeming
as
if
i
was
trying
to
smuggle
out
of
this
world
with
him
when
of
course
i
must
break
down
in
the
attempt
and
bring
all
back
again
as
it
is
there
be
nothing
to
bring
back
but
me
and
that
quite
consistent
for
i
sha
be
brought
back
some
day
after
that
previous
carrying
of
him
in
the
streets
the
wretched
old
fellow
seemed
to
be
twice
buried
he
was
taken
on
the
shoulders
of
half
a
dozen
men
who
shuffled
with
him
to
the
churchyard
and
who
were
preceded
by
another
man
affecting
a
stately
stalk
as
if
he
were
a
policeman
of
the
d
eath
division
and
ceremoniously
pretending
not
to
know
his
intimate
acquaintances
as
he
led
the
pageant
yet
the
spectacle
of
only
one
little
mourner
hobbling
after
caused
many
people
to
turn
their
heads
with
a
look
of
interest
at
last
the
troublesome
deceased
was
got
into
the
ground
to
be
buried
no
more
and
the
stately
stalker
stalked
back
before
the
solitary
dressmaker
as
if
she
were
bound
in
honour
to
have
no
notion
of
the
way
home
those
furies
the
conventionalities
being
thus
appeased
he
left
her
must
have
a
very
short
cry
godmother
before
i
cheer
up
for
good
said
the
little
creature
coming
in
after
all
a
child
is
a
child
you
know
it
was
a
longer
cry
than
might
have
been
expected
howbeit
it
wore
itself
out
in
a
shadowy
corner
and
then
the
dressmaker
came
forth
and
washed
her
face
and
made
the
tea
would
mind
my
cutting
out
something
while
we
are
at
tea
would
you
she
asked
her
jewish
friend
with
a
coaxing
air
dear
child
the
old
man
expostulated
you
never
rest
it
not
work
cutting
out
a
pattern
is
said
miss
jenny
with
her
busy
little
scissors
already
snipping
at
some
paper
truth
is
godmother
i
want
to
fix
it
while
i
have
it
correct
in
my
mind
you
seen
it
then
asked
riah
godmother
saw
it
just
now
it
a
surplice
that
what
it
is
thing
our
clergymen
wear
you
know
explained
miss
jenny
in
consideration
of
his
professing
another
faith
what
have
you
to
do
with
that
jenny
godmother
replied
the
dressmaker
must
know
that
we
professors
who
live
upon
our
taste
and
invention
are
obliged
to
keep
our
eyes
always
open
and
you
know
already
that
i
have
many
extra
expenses
to
meet
just
now
so
it
came
into
my
head
while
i
was
weeping
at
my
poor
boy
grave
that
something
in
my
way
might
be
done
with
a
clergyman
can
be
done
asked
the
old
man
a
funeral
never
fear
returned
miss
jenny
anticipating
his
objection
with
a
nod
public
do
like
to
be
made
melancholy
i
know
very
well
i
am
seldom
called
upon
to
put
my
young
friends
into
mourning
not
into
real
mourning
that
is
court
mourning
they
are
rather
proud
of
but
a
doll
clergyman
my
dear
glossy
black
curls
and
whiskers
uniting
two
of
my
young
friends
in
matrimony
said
miss
jenny
shaking
her
forefinger
quite
another
affair
if
you
see
those
three
at
the
altar
in
bond
street
in
a
jiffy
my
name
jack
robinson
with
her
expert
little
ways
in
sharp
action
she
had
got
a
doll
into
paper
orders
before
the
meal
was
over
and
was
displaying
it
for
the
edification
of
the
jewish
mind
when
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
riah
went
to
open
it
and
presently
came
back
ushering
in
with
the
grave
and
courteous
air
that
sat
so
well
upon
him
a
gentleman
the
gentleman
was
a
stranger
to
the
dressmaker
but
even
in
the
moment
of
his
casting
his
eyes
upon
her
there
was
something
in
his
manner
which
brought
to
her
remembrance
mr
eugene
wrayburn
me
said
the
gentleman
are
the
dolls
dressmaker
am
the
dolls
dressmaker
sir
hexam
friend
sir
replied
miss
jenny
instantly
on
the
defensive
lizzie
hexam
friend
is
a
note
from
her
entreating

to

to
the
request
of
mr
mortimer
lightwood
the
bearer
mr
riah

to
know
that
i
am
mr
mortimer
lightwood
and
will
tell
you
so
riah
bent
his
head
in
corroboration
you
read
the
note
very
short
said
jenny
with
a
look
of
wonder
when
she
had
read
it
was
no
time
to
make
it
longer
time
was
so
very
precious
my
dear
friend
mr
eugene
wrayburn
is
dying
the
dressmaker
clasped
her
hands
and
uttered
a
little
piteous
cry
dying
repeated
lightwood
with
emotion
some
distance
from
here
he
is
sinking
under
injuries
received
at
the
hands
of
a
villain
who
attacked
him
in
the
dark
i
come
straight
from
his
bedside
he
is
almost
always
insensible
in
a
short
restless
interval
of
sensibility
or
partial
sensibility
i
made
out
that
he
asked
for
you
to
be
brought
to
sit
by
him
hardly
relying
on
my
own
interpretation
of
the
indistinct
sounds
he
made
i
caused
lizzie
to
hear
them
we
were
both
sure
that
he
asked
for
you
the
dressmaker
with
her
hands
still
clasped
looked
affrightedly
from
the
one
to
the
other
of
her
two
companions
you
delay
he
may
die
with
his
request
ungratified
with
his
last
wish
intrusted
to
me
we
have
long
been
much
more
than
brothers
unfulfilled
i
shall
break
down
if
i
try
to
say
more
in
a
few
moments
the
black
bonnet
and
the
were
on
duty
the
good
jew
was
left
in
possession
of
the
house
and
the
dolls
dressmaker
side
by
side
in
a
chaise
with
mortimer
lightwood
was
posting
out
of
town
chapter
the
dolls
dressmaker
discovers
a
word
a
darkened
and
hushed
room
the
river
outside
the
windows
flowing
on
to
the
vast
ocean
a
figure
on
the
bed
swathed
and
bandaged
and
bound
lying
helpless
on
its
back
with
its
two
useless
arms
in
splints
at
its
sides
only
two
days
of
usage
so
familiarized
the
little
dressmaker
with
this
scene
that
it
held
the
place
occupied
two
days
ago
by
the
recollections
of
years
he
had
scarcely
moved
since
her
arrival
sometimes
his
eyes
were
open
sometimes
closed
when
they
were
open
there
was
no
meaning
in
their
unwinking
stare
at
one
spot
straight
before
them
unless
for
a
moment
the
brow
knitted
into
a
faint
expression
of
anger
or
surprise
then
mortimer
lightwood
would
speak
to
him
and
on
occasions
he
would
be
so
far
roused
as
to
make
an
attempt
to
pronounce
his
friend
name
but
in
an
instant
consciousness
was
gone
again
and
no
spirit
of
eugene
was
in
eugene
crushed
outer
form
they
provided
jenny
with
materials
for
plying
her
work
and
she
had
a
little
table
placed
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
sitting
there
with
her
rich
shower
of
hair
falling
over
the
they
hoped
she
might
attract
his
notice
with
the
same
object
she
would
sing
just
above
her
breath
when
he
opened
his
eyes
or
she
saw
his
brow
knit
into
that
faint
expression
so
evanescent
that
it
was
like
a
shape
made
in
water
but
as
yet
he
had
not
heeded
the
here
mentioned
were
the
medical
attendant
lizzie
who
was
there
in
all
her
intervals
of
rest
and
lightwood
who
never
left
him
the
two
days
became
three
and
the
three
days
became
four
at
length
quite
unexpectedly
he
said
something
in
a
whisper
was
it
my
dear
eugene
you
mortimer
i
for
her
dear
fellow
she
is
here
quite
unconscious
of
the
long
blank
he
supposed
that
they
were
still
speaking
together
the
little
dressmaker
stood
up
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
humming
her
song
and
nodded
to
him
brightly
ca
shake
hands
jenny
said
eugene
with
something
of
his
old
look
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
mortimer
repeated
this
to
her
for
it
could
only
be
made
out
by
bending
over
him
and
closely
watching
his
attempts
to
say
it
in
a
little
while
he
added
her
if
she
has
seen
the
children
mortimer
could
not
understand
this
neither
could
jenny
herself
until
he
added
her
if
she
has
smelt
the
flowers
i
know
cried
jenny
understand
him
now
then
lightwood
yielded
his
place
to
her
quick
approach
and
she
said
bending
over
the
bed
with
that
better
look
mean
my
long
bright
slanting
rows
of
children
who
used
to
bring
me
ease
and
rest
you
mean
the
children
who
used
to
take
me
up
and
make
me
light
eugene
smiled
have
not
seen
them
since
i
saw
you
i
never
see
them
now
but
i
am
hardly
ever
in
pain
now
was
a
pretty
fancy
said
eugene
i
have
heard
my
birds
sing
cried
the
little
creature
i
have
smelt
my
flowers
yes
indeed
i
have
and
both
were
most
beautiful
and
most
divine
and
help
to
nurse
me
said
eugene
quietly
should
like
you
to
have
the
fancy
here
before
i
die
she
touched
his
lips
with
her
hand
and
shaded
her
eyes
with
that
same
hand
as
she
went
back
to
her
work
and
her
little
low
song
he
heard
the
song
with
evident
pleasure
until
she
allowed
it
gradually
to
sink
away
into
silence
dear
eugene
you
can
give
me
anything
to
keep
me
here
for
only
a
few
minutes
keep
you
here
eugene
prevent
my
wandering
away
i
do
know
where
for
i
begin
to
be
sensible
that
i
have
just
come
back
and
that
i
shall
lose
myself
again
do
so
dear
boy
mortimer
gave
him
such
stimulants
as
could
be
given
him
with
safety
they
were
always
at
hand
ready
and
bending
over
him
once
more
was
about
to
caution
him
when
he
said
tell
me
not
to
speak
for
i
must
speak
if
you
knew
the
harassing
anxiety
that
gnaws
and
wears
me
when
i
am
wandering
in
those
places
where
are
those
endless
places
mortimer
they
must
be
at
an
immense
distance
he
saw
in
his
friend
face
that
he
was
losing
himself
for
he
added
after
a
moment
be
afraid
i
am
not
gone
yet
what
was
it
wanted
to
tell
me
something
eugene
my
poor
dear
fellow
you
wanted
to
say
something
to
your
old
friend
to
the
friend
who
has
always
loved
you
admired
you
imitated
you
founded
himself
upon
you
been
nothing
without
you
and
who
god
knows
would
be
here
in
your
place
if
he
could
tut
said
eugene
with
a
tender
glance
as
the
other
put
his
hand
before
his
face
am
not
worth
it
i
acknowledge
that
i
like
it
dear
boy
but
i
am
not
worth
it
this
attack
my
dear
mortimer
this
murder
his
friend
leaned
over
him
with
renewed
attention
saying
and
i
suspect
some
one
than
suspect
but
mortimer
while
i
lie
here
and
when
i
lie
here
no
longer
i
trust
to
you
that
the
perpetrator
is
never
brought
to
justice
innocent
reputation
would
be
ruined
my
friend
she
would
be
punished
not
he
i
have
wronged
her
enough
in
fact
i
have
wronged
her
still
more
in
intention
you
recollect
what
pavement
is
said
to
be
made
of
good
intentions
it
is
made
of
bad
intentions
too
mortimer
i
am
lying
on
it
and
i
know
comforted
my
dear
eugene
will
when
you
have
promised
me
dear
mortimer
the
man
must
never
be
pursued
if
he
should
be
accused
you
must
keep
him
silent
and
save
him
do
think
of
avenging
me
think
only
of
hushing
the
story
and
protecting
her
you
can
confuse
the
case
and
turn
aside
the
circumstances
listen
to
what
i
say
to
you
it
was
not
the
schoolmaster
bradley
headstone
do
you
hear
me
twice
it
was
not
the
schoolmaster
bradley
headstone
do
you
hear
me
three
times
it
was
not
the
schoolmaster
bradley
headstone
he
stopped
exhausted
his
speech
had
been
whispered
broken
and
indistinct
but
by
a
great
effort
he
had
made
it
plain
enough
to
be
unmistakeable
fellow
i
am
wandering
away
stay
me
for
another
moment
if
you
can
lightwood
lifted
his
head
at
the
neck
and
put
a
to
his
lips
he
rallied
do
know
how
long
ago
it
was
done
whether
weeks
days
or
hours
no
matter
there
is
inquiry
on
foot
and
pursuit
say
is
there
not
it
divert
it
do
let
her
be
brought
in
question
shield
her
the
guilty
man
brought
to
justice
would
poison
her
name
let
the
guilty
man
go
unpunished
lizzie
and
my
reparation
before
all
promise
me
i
do
i
promise
you
in
the
act
of
turning
his
eyes
gratefully
towards
his
friend
he
wandered
away
his
eyes
stood
still
and
settled
into
that
former
intent
unmeaning
stare
hours
and
hours
days
and
nights
he
remained
in
this
same
condition
there
were
times
when
he
would
calmly
speak
to
his
friend
after
a
long
period
of
unconsciousness
and
would
say
he
was
better
and
would
ask
for
something
before
it
could
be
given
him
he
would
be
gone
again
the
dolls
dressmaker
all
softened
compassion
now
watched
him
with
an
earnestness
that
never
relaxed
she
would
regularly
change
the
ice
or
the
cooling
spirit
on
his
head
and
would
keep
her
ear
at
the
pillow
betweenwhiles
listening
for
any
faint
words
that
fell
from
him
in
his
wanderings
it
was
amazing
through
how
many
hours
at
a
time
she
would
remain
beside
him
in
a
crouching
attitude
attentive
to
his
slightest
moan
as
he
could
not
move
a
hand
he
could
make
no
sign
of
distress
but
through
this
close
watching
if
through
no
secret
sympathy
or
power
the
little
creature
attained
an
understanding
of
him
that
lightwood
did
not
possess
mortimer
would
often
turn
to
her
as
if
she
were
an
interpreter
between
this
sentient
world
and
the
insensible
man
and
she
would
change
the
dressing
of
a
wound
or
ease
a
ligature
or
turn
his
face
or
alter
the
pressure
of
the
bedclothes
on
him
with
an
absolute
certainty
of
doing
right
the
natural
lightness
and
delicacy
of
touch
which
had
become
very
refined
by
practice
in
her
miniature
work
no
doubt
was
involved
in
this
but
her
perception
was
at
least
as
fine
the
one
word
lizzie
he
muttered
millions
of
times
in
a
certain
phase
of
his
distressful
state
which
was
the
worst
to
those
who
tended
him
he
would
roll
his
head
upon
the
pillow
incessantly
repeating
the
name
in
a
hurried
and
impatient
manner
with
the
misery
of
a
disturbed
mind
and
the
monotony
of
a
machine
equally
when
he
lay
still
and
staring
he
would
repeat
it
for
hours
without
cessation
but
then
always
in
a
tone
of
subdued
warning
and
horror
her
presence
and
her
touch
upon
his
breast
or
face
would
often
stop
this
and
then
they
learned
to
expect
that
he
would
for
some
time
remain
still
with
his
eyes
closed
and
that
he
would
be
conscious
on
opening
them
but
the
heavy
disappointment
of
their
hope
revived
by
the
welcome
silence
of
the
room
was
that
his
spirit
would
glide
away
again
and
be
lost
in
the
moment
of
their
joy
that
it
was
there
this
frequent
rising
of
a
drowning
man
from
the
deep
to
sink
again
was
dreadful
to
the
beholders
but
gradually
the
change
stole
upon
him
that
it
became
dreadful
to
himself
his
desire
to
impart
something
that
was
on
his
mind
his
unspeakable
yearning
to
have
speech
with
his
friend
and
make
a
communication
to
him
so
troubled
him
when
he
recovered
consciousness
that
its
term
was
thereby
shortened
as
the
man
rising
from
the
deep
would
disappear
the
sooner
for
fighting
with
the
water
so
he
in
his
desperate
struggle
went
down
again
one
afternoon
when
he
had
been
lying
still
and
lizzie
unrecognized
had
just
stolen
out
of
the
room
to
pursue
her
occupation
he
uttered
lightwood
name
dear
eugene
i
am
here
long
is
this
to
last
mortimer
lightwood
shook
his
head
eugene
you
are
no
worse
than
you
were
i
know
there
no
hope
yet
i
pray
it
may
last
long
enough
for
you
to
do
me
one
last
service
and
for
me
to
do
one
last
action
keep
me
here
a
few
moments
mortimer
try
try
his
friend
gave
him
what
aid
he
could
and
encouraged
him
to
believe
that
he
was
more
composed
though
even
then
his
eyes
were
losing
the
expression
they
so
rarely
recovered
me
here
dear
fellow
if
you
can
stop
my
wandering
away
i
am
going
yet
not
yet
tell
me
dear
eugene
what
is
it
i
shall
do
me
here
for
only
a
single
minute
i
am
going
away
again
do
let
me
go
hear
me
speak
first
stop
me
stop
me
poor
eugene
try
to
be
calm
do
try
i
try
so
hard
if
you
only
knew
how
hard
do
let
me
wander
till
i
have
spoken
give
me
a
little
more
wine
lightwood
complied
eugene
with
a
most
pathetic
struggle
against
the
unconsciousness
that
was
coming
over
him
and
with
a
look
of
appeal
that
affected
his
friend
profoundly
said
can
leave
me
with
jenny
while
you
speak
to
her
and
tell
her
what
i
beseech
of
her
you
can
leave
me
with
jenny
while
you
are
gone
not
much
for
you
to
do
you
wo
be
long
away
no
no
but
tell
me
what
it
is
that
i
shall
do
eugene
am
going
you
ca
hold
me
me
in
a
word
eugene
his
eyes
were
fixed
again
and
the
only
word
that
came
from
his
lips
was
the
word
millions
of
times
repeated
lizzie
lizzie
lizzie
but
the
watchful
little
dressmaker
had
been
vigilant
as
ever
in
her
watch
and
she
now
came
up
and
touched
lightwood
arm
as
he
looked
down
at
his
friend
despairingly
she
said
with
her
finger
on
her
lips
eyes
are
closing
he
be
conscious
when
he
next
opens
them
shall
i
give
you
a
leading
word
to
say
to
him
jenny
if
you
could
only
give
me
the
right
word
can
stoop
down
he
stooped
and
she
whispered
in
his
ear
she
whispered
in
his
ear
one
short
word
of
a
single
syllable
lightwood
started
and
looked
at
her
it
said
the
little
creature
with
an
excited
and
exultant
face
she
then
bent
over
the
unconscious
man
and
for
the
first
time
kissed
him
on
the
cheek
and
kissed
the
poor
maimed
hand
that
was
nearest
to
her
then
she
withdrew
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
some
two
hours
afterwards
mortimer
lightwood
saw
his
consciousness
come
back
and
instantly
but
very
tranquilly
bent
over
him
speak
eugene
do
no
more
than
look
at
me
and
listen
to
me
you
follow
what
i
say
he
moved
his
head
in
assent

going
on

the
point
where

broke
off

the
word

should
soon
have

some
few
hours
to
give
effect
to
your
wishes

unavoidable
friend
i
said
so
but
i
had
not
the
clue
then
how
do
you
think
i
got
it
glancing
wistfully
around
eugene
saw
miss
jenny
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
looking
at
him
with
her
elbows
on
the
bed
and
her
head
upon
her
hands
there
was
a
trace
of
his
whimsical
air
upon
him
as
he
tried
to
smile
at
her
indeed
said
lightwood
discovery
was
hers
observe
my
dear
eugene
while
i
am
away
you
will
know
that
i
have
discharged
my
trust
with
lizzie
by
finding
her
here
in
my
present
place
at
your
bedside
to
leave
you
no
more
a
final
word
before
i
go
this

dear
fellow
miss
jenny
gave
up
altogether
on
this
parting
taking
place
between
the
friends
and
sitting
with
her
back
towards
the
bed
in
the
bower
made
by
her
bright
hair
wept
heartily
though
noiselessly
mortimer
lightwood
was
soon
gone
as
the
evening
light
lengthened
the
heavy
reflections
of
the
trees
in
the
river
another
figure
came
with
a
soft
step
into
the
sick
room
he
conscious
asked
the
little
dressmaker
as
the
figure
took
its
station
by
the
pillow
for
jenny
had
given
place
to
it
immediately
and
could
not
see
the
sufferer
face
in
the
dark
room
from
her
new
and
removed
position

conscious
jenny
murmured

chapter

to
the
dolls
dressmaker
discovery
mrs
john
rokesmith
sat
at
needlework
in
her
neat
little
room
beside
a
basket
of
neat
little
articles
of
clothing
which
presented
so
much
of
the
appearance
of
being
in
the
dolls
dressmaker
way
of
business
that
one
might
have
supposed
she
was
going
to
set
up
in
opposition
to
miss
wren
whether
the
complete
british
family
housewife
had
imparted
sage
counsel
anent
them
did
not
appear
but
probably
not
as
that
cloudy
oracle
was
nowhere
visible
for
certain
however
mrs
john
rokesmith
stitched
at
them
with
so
dexterous
a
hand
that
she
must
have
taken
lessons
of
somebody
love
is
in
all
things
a
most
wonderful
teacher
and
perhaps
love
from
a
pictorial
point
of
view
with
nothing
on
but
a
thimble
had
been
teaching
this
branch
of
needlework
to
mrs
john
rokesmith
it
was
near
john
time
for
coming
home
but
as
mrs
john
was
desirous
to
finish
a
special
triumph
of
her
skill
before
dinner
she
did
not
go
out
to
meet
him
placidly
though
rather
consequentially
smiling
she
sat
stitching
away
with
a
regular
sound
like
a
sort
of
dimpled
little
charming
clock
by
the
very
best
maker
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
ring
at
the
bell
not
john
or
bella
would
have
flown
out
to
meet
him
then
who
if
not
john
bella
was
asking
herself
the
question
when
that
fluttering
little
fool
of
a
servant
fluttered
in
saying
lightwood
oh
good
gracious
bella
had
but
time
to
throw
a
handkerchief
over
the
basket
when
mr
lightwood
made
his
bow
there
was
something
amiss
with
mr
lightwood
for
he
was
strangely
grave
and
looked
with
a
brief
reference
to
the
happy
time
when
it
had
been
his
privilege
to
know
mrs
rokesmith
as
miss
wilfer
mr
lightwood
explained
what
was
amiss
with
him
and
why
he
came
he
came
bearing
lizzie
hexam
earnest
hope
that
mrs
john
rokesmith
would
see
her
married
bella
was
so
fluttered
by
the
request
and
by
the
short
narrative
he
had
feelingly
given
her
that
there
never
was
a
more
timely
than
john
knock
husband
said
bella
bring
him
in
but
that
turned
out
to
be
more
easily
said
than
done
for
the
instant
she
mentioned
mr
lightwood
name
john
stopped
with
his
hand
upon
the
lock
of
the
room
door
up
stairs
my
darling
bella
was
amazed
by
the
flush
in
his
face
and
by
his
sudden
turning
away
can
it
mean
she
thought
as
she
accompanied
him
up
stairs
my
life
said
john
taking
her
on
his
knee
me
all
about
it
all
very
well
to
say
me
all
about
it
but
john
was
very
much
confused
his
attention
evidently
trailed
off
now
and
then
even
while
bella
told
him
all
about
it
yet
she
knew
that
he
took
a
great
interest
in
lizzie
and
her
fortunes
what
could
it
mean
will
come
to
this
marriage
with
me
john
dear
no
my
love
i
ca
do
that
ca
do
that
john
my
dear
it
quite
out
of
the
question
not
to
be
thought
of
i
to
go
alone
john
my
dear
you
will
go
with
mr
lightwood
you
think
it
time
we
went
down
to
mr
lightwood
john
dear
bella
insinuated
darling
it
almost
time
you
went
but
i
must
ask
you
to
excuse
me
to
him
altogether
never
mean
john
dear
that
you
are
not
going
to
see
him
why
he
knows
you
have
come
home
i
told
him
so
a
little
unfortunate
but
it
ca
be
helped
unfortunate
or
fortunate
i
positively
can
not
see
him
my
love
bella
cast
about
in
her
mind
what
could
be
his
reason
for
this
unaccountable
behaviour
as
she
sat
on
his
knee
looking
at
him
in
astonishment
and
pouting
a
little
a
weak
reason
presented
itself
dear
you
never
can
be
jealous
of
mr
lightwood
my
precious
child
returned
her
husband
laughing
outright
could
i
be
jealous
of
him
why
should
i
be
jealous
of
him
you
know
john
pursued
bella
pouting
a
little
more
he
did
rather
admire
me
once
it
was
not
my
fault
was
your
fault
that
i
admired
you
returned
her
husband
with
a
look
of
pride
in
her
why
not
your
fault
that
he
admired
you
but
i
jealous
on
that
account
why
i
must
go
distracted
for
life
if
i
turned
jealous
of
every
one
who
used
to
find
my
wife
beautiful
and
winning
am
half
angry
with
you
john
dear
said
bella
laughing
a
little
half
pleased
with
you
because
you
are
such
a
stupid
old
fellow
and
yet
you
say
nice
things
as
if
you
meant
them
do
be
mysterious
sir
what
harm
do
you
know
of
mr
lightwood
my
love
has
he
ever
done
to
you
john
has
never
done
anything
to
me
my
dear
i
know
no
more
against
him
than
i
know
against
mr
wrayburn
he
has
never
done
anything
to
me
neither
has
mr
wrayburn
and
yet
i
have
exactly
the
same
objection
to
both
of
them
john
retorted
bella
as
if
she
were
giving
him
up
for
a
bad
job
as
she
used
to
give
up
herself
are
nothing
better
than
a
sphinx
and
a
married
sphinx
is
a
is
a
nice
confidential
husband
said
bella
in
a
tone
of
injury
my
life
said
john
rokesmith
touching
her
cheek
with
a
grave
smile
as
she
cast
down
her
eyes
and
pouted
again
at
me
i
want
to
speak
to
you
earnest
blue
beard
of
the
secret
chamber
asked
bella
clearing
her
pretty
face
earnest
and
i
confess
to
the
secret
chamber
do
you
remember
that
you
asked
me
not
to
declare
what
i
thought
of
your
higher
qualities
until
you
had
been
tried
john
dear
and
i
fully
meant
it
and
i
fully
mean
it
time
will
come
my
darling
i
am
no
prophet
but
i
say
so
when
you
will
be
tried
the
time
will
come
i
think
when
you
will
undergo
a
trial
through
which
you
will
never
pass
quite
triumphantly
for
me
unless
you
can
put
perfect
faith
in
me
you
may
be
sure
of
me
john
dear
for
i
can
put
perfect
faith
in
you
and
i
do
and
i
always
always
will
do
judge
me
by
a
little
thing
like
this
john
in
little
things
i
am
a
little
thing
myself
i
always
was
but
in
great
things
i
hope
not
i
do
mean
to
boast
john
dear
but
i
hope
not
he
was
even
better
convinced
of
the
truth
of
what
she
said
than
she
was
as
he
felt
her
loving
arms
about
him
if
the
golden
dustman
riches
had
been
his
to
stake
he
would
have
staked
them
to
the
last
farthing
on
the
fidelity
through
good
and
evil
of
her
affectionate
and
trusting
heart
i
go
down
to
and
go
away
with
mr
lightwood
said
bella
springing
up
are
the
most
creasing
and
tumbling
of
a
packer
john
that
ever
was
but
if
you
quite
good
and
will
promise
never
to
do
so
any
more
though
i
do
know
what
you
have
done
you
may
pack
me
a
little
bag
for
a
night
while
i
get
my
bonnet
on
he
gaily
complied
and
she
tied
her
dimpled
chin
up
and
shook
her
head
into
her
bonnet
and
pulled
out
the
bows
of
her
and
got
her
gloves
on
finger
by
finger
and
finally
got
them
on
her
little
plump
hands
and
bade
him
and
went
down
mr
impatience
was
much
relieved
when
he
found
her
dressed
for
departure
rokesmith
goes
with
us
he
said
hesitating
with
a
look
towards
the
door
i
forgot
replied
bella
best
compliments
his
face
is
swollen
to
the
size
of
two
faces
and
he
is
to
go
to
bed
directly
poor
fellow
to
wait
for
the
doctor
who
is
coming
to
lance
him
is
curious
observed
lightwood
i
have
never
yet
seen
mr
rokesmith
though
we
have
been
engaged
in
the
same
affairs
said
the
unblushing
bella
begin
to
think
observed
lightwood
i
never
shall
see
him
things
happen
so
oddly
sometimes
said
bella
with
a
steady
countenance
there
seems
a
kind
of
fatality
in
them
but
i
am
quite
ready
mr
lightwood
they
started
directly
in
a
little
carriage
that
lightwood
had
brought
with
him
from
greenwich
and
from
greenwich
they
started
directly
for
london
and
in
london
they
waited
at
a
railway
station
until
such
time
as
the
reverend
frank
milvey
and
margaretta
his
wife
with
whom
mortimer
lightwood
had
been
already
in
conference
should
come
and
join
them
that
worthy
couple
were
delayed
by
a
portentous
old
parishioner
of
the
female
gender
who
was
one
of
the
plagues
of
their
lives
and
with
whom
they
bore
with
most
exemplary
sweetness
and
notwithstanding
her
having
an
infection
of
absurdity
about
her
that
communicated
itself
to
everything
with
which
and
everybody
with
whom
she
came
in
contact
she
was
a
member
of
the
reverend
frank
congregation
and
made
a
point
of
distinguishing
herself
in
that
body
by
conspicuously
weeping
at
everything
however
cheering
said
by
the
reverend
frank
in
his
public
ministration
also
by
applying
to
herself
the
various
lamentations
of
david
and
complaining
in
a
personally
injured
manner
much
in
arrear
of
the
clerk
and
the
rest
of
the
respondents
that
her
enemies
were
digging
about
her
and
breaking
her
with
rods
of
iron
indeed
this
old
widow
discharged
herself
of
that
portion
of
the
morning
and
evening
service
as
if
she
were
lodging
a
complaint
on
oath
and
applying
for
a
warrant
before
a
magistrate
but
this
was
not
her
most
inconvenient
characteristic
for
that
took
the
form
of
an
impression
usually
recurring
in
inclement
weather
and
at
about
daybreak
that
she
had
something
on
her
mind
and
stood
in
immediate
need
of
the
reverend
frank
to
come
and
take
it
off
many
a
time
had
that
kind
creature
got
up
and
gone
out
to
mrs
sprodgkin
such
was
the
disciple
name
suppressing
a
strong
sense
of
her
comicality
by
his
strong
sense
of
duty
and
perfectly
knowing
that
nothing
but
a
cold
would
come
of
it
however
beyond
themselves
the
reverend
frank
milvey
and
mrs
milvey
seldom
hinted
that
mrs
sprodgkin
was
hardly
worth
the
trouble
she
gave
but
both
made
the
best
of
her
as
they
did
of
all
their
troubles
this
very
exacting
member
of
the
fold
appeared
to
be
endowed
with
a
sixth
sense
in
regard
of
knowing
when
the
reverend
frank
milvey
least
desired
her
company
and
with
promptitude
appearing
in
his
little
hall
consequently
when
the
reverend
frank
had
willingly
engaged
that
he
and
his
wife
would
accompany
lightwood
back
he
said
as
a
matter
of
course
must
make
haste
to
get
out
margaretta
my
dear
or
we
shall
be
descended
on
by
mrs
sprodgkin
to
which
mrs
milvey
replied
in
her
pleasantly
emphatic
way
yes
for
she
is
such
a
marplot
frank
and
does
worry
so
words
that
were
scarcely
uttered
when
their
theme
was
announced
as
in
faithful
attendance
below
desiring
counsel
on
a
spiritual
matter
the
points
on
which
mrs
sprodgkin
sought
elucidation
being
seldom
of
a
pressing
nature
as
who
begat
whom
or
some
information
concerning
the
amorites
mrs
milvey
on
this
special
occasion
resorted
to
the
device
of
buying
her
off
with
a
present
of
tea
and
sugar
and
a
loaf
and
butter
these
gifts
mrs
sprodgkin
accepted
but
still
insisted
on
dutifully
remaining
in
the
hall
to
curtsey
to
the
reverend
frank
as
he
came
forth
who
incautiously
saying
in
his
genial
manner
sally
there
you
are
involved
himself
in
a
discursive
address
from
mrs
sprodgkin
revolving
around
the
result
that
she
regarded
tea
and
sugar
in
the
light
of
myrrh
and
frankincense
and
considered
bread
and
butter
identical
with
locusts
and
wild
honey
having
communicated
this
edifying
piece
of
information
mrs
sprodgkin
was
left
still
unadjourned
in
the
hall
and
mr
and
mrs
milvey
hurried
in
a
heated
condition
to
the
railway
station
all
of
which
is
here
recorded
to
the
honour
of
that
good
christian
pair
representatives
of
hundreds
of
other
good
christian
pairs
as
conscientious
and
as
useful
who
merge
the
smallness
of
their
work
in
its
greatness
and
feel
in
no
danger
of
losing
dignity
when
they
adapt
themselves
to
incomprehensible
humbugs
at
the
last
moment
by
one
who
had
a
claim
upon
me
was
the
reverend
frank
apology
to
lightwood
taking
no
thought
of
himself
to
which
mrs
milvey
added
taking
thought
for
him
like
the
championing
little
wife
she
was
yes
detained
at
the
last
moment
but
as
to
the
claim
frank
i
must
say
that
i
do
think
you
are
sometimes
and
allow
that
to
be
a
little
abused
bella
felt
conscious
in
spite
of
her
late
pledge
for
herself
that
her
husband
absence
would
give
disagreeable
occasion
for
surprise
to
the
milveys
nor
could
she
appear
quite
at
her
ease
when
mrs
milvey
asked
is
mr
rokesmith
and
is
he
gone
before
us
or
does
he
follow
us
it
becoming
necessary
upon
this
to
send
him
to
bed
again
and
hold
him
in
waiting
to
be
lanced
again
bella
did
it
but
not
half
as
well
on
the
second
occasion
as
on
the
first
for
a
white
one
seems
almost
to
become
a
black
one
when
you
are
not
used
to
it
dear
said
mrs
milvey
am
so
sorry
mr
rokesmith
took
such
an
interest
in
lizzie
hexam
when
we
were
there
before
and
if
we
had
only
known
of
his
face
we
could
have
given
him
something
that
would
have
kept
it
down
long
enough
for
so
short
a
purpose
by
way
of
making
the
white
one
whiter
bella
hastened
to
stipulate
that
he
was
not
in
pain
mrs
milvey
was
so
glad
of
it
do
know
how
it
is
said
mrs
milvey
i
am
sure
you
do
frank
but
the
clergy
and
their
wives
seem
to
cause
swelled
faces
whenever
i
take
notice
of
a
child
in
the
school
it
seems
to
me
as
if
its
face
swelled
instantly
frank
never
makes
acquaintance
with
a
new
old
woman
but
she
gets
the
and
another
thing
is
we
do
make
the
poor
children
sniff
so
i
do
know
how
we
do
it
and
i
should
be
so
glad
not
to
but
the
more
we
take
notice
of
them
the
more
they
sniff
just
as
they
do
when
the
text
is
given
frank
that
a
schoolmaster
i
have
seen
him
somewhere
the
reference
was
to
a
young
man
of
reserved
appearance
in
a
coat
and
waistcoat
of
black
and
pantaloons
of
pepper
and
salt
he
had
come
into
the
office
of
the
station
from
its
interior
in
an
unsettled
way
immediately
after
lightwood
had
gone
out
to
the
train
and
he
had
been
hurriedly
reading
the
printed
bills
and
notices
on
the
wall
he
had
had
a
wandering
interest
in
what
was
said
among
the
people
waiting
there
and
passing
to
and
fro
he
had
drawn
nearer
at
about
the
time
when
mrs
milvey
mentioned
lizzie
hexam
and
had
remained
near
since
though
always
glancing
towards
the
door
by
which
lightwood
had
gone
out
he
stood
with
his
back
towards
them
and
his
gloved
hands
clasped
behind
him
there
was
now
so
evident
a
faltering
upon
him
expressive
of
indecision
whether
or
no
he
should
express
his
having
heard
himself
referred
to
that
mr
milvey
spoke
to
him
can
not
recall
your
name
he
said
i
remember
to
have
seen
you
in
your
school
name
is
bradley
headstone
sir
he
replied
backing
into
a
more
retired
place
ought
to
have
remembered
it
said
mr
milvey
giving
him
his
hand
hope
you
are
well
a
little
overworked
i
am
afraid
i
am
overworked
just
at
present
sir
no
play
in
your
last
holiday
time
sir
work
and
no
play
mr
headstone
will
not
make
dulness
in
your
case
i
dare
say
but
it
will
make
dyspepsia
if
you
do
take
care
will
endeavour
to
take
care
sir
might
i
beg
leave
to
speak
to
you
outside
a
moment
all
means
it
was
evening
and
the
office
was
well
lighted
the
schoolmaster
who
had
never
remitted
his
watch
on
lightwood
door
now
moved
by
another
door
to
a
corner
without
where
there
was
more
shadow
than
light
and
said
plucking
at
his
gloves
of
your
ladies
sir
mentioned
within
my
hearing
a
name
that
i
am
acquainted
with
i
may
say
well
acquainted
with
the
name
of
the
sister
of
an
old
pupil
of
mine
he
was
my
pupil
for
a
long
time
and
has
got
on
and
gone
upward
rapidly
the
name
of
hexam
the
name
of
lizzie
hexam
he
seemed
to
be
a
shy
man
struggling
against
nervousness
and
spoke
in
a
very
constrained
way
the
break
he
set
between
his
last
two
sentences
was
quite
embarrassing
to
his
hearer
replied
mr
milvey
are
going
down
to
see
her
gathered
as
much
sir
i
hope
there
is
nothing
amiss
with
the
sister
of
my
old
pupil
i
hope
no
bereavement
has
befallen
her
i
hope
she
is
in
no
affliction
has
lost
no
relation
mr
milvey
thought
this
a
man
with
a
very
odd
manner
and
a
dark
downward
look
but
he
answered
in
his
usual
open
way
am
glad
to
tell
you
mr
headstone
that
the
sister
of
your
old
pupil
has
not
sustained
any
such
loss
you
thought
i
might
be
going
down
to
bury
some
one
may
have
been
the
connexion
of
ideas
sir
with
your
clerical
character
but
i
was
not
conscious
of
then
you
are
not
sir
a
man
with
a
very
odd
manner
indeed
and
with
a
lurking
look
that
was
quite
oppressive
in
fact
said
mr
milvey
you
are
so
interested
in
the
sister
of
your
old
pupil
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
i
am
going
down
to
marry
her
the
schoolmaster
started
back
to
marry
her
myself
said
mr
milvey
with
a
smile
i
have
a
wife
already
to
perform
the
marriage
service
at
her
wedding
bradley
headstone
caught
hold
of
a
pillar
behind
him
if
mr
milvey
knew
an
ashy
face
when
he
saw
it
he
saw
it
then
are
quite
ill
mr
headstone
is
not
much
sir
it
will
pass
over
very
soon
i
am
accustomed
to
be
seized
with
giddiness
do
let
me
detain
you
sir
i
stand
in
need
of
no
assistance
i
thank
you
much
obliged
by
your
sparing
me
these
minutes
of
your
time
as
mr
milvey
who
had
no
more
minutes
to
spare
made
a
suitable
reply
and
turned
back
into
the
office
he
observed
the
schoolmaster
to
lean
against
the
pillar
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
to
pull
at
his
neckcloth
as
if
he
were
trying
to
tear
it
off
the
reverend
frank
accordingly
directed
the
notice
of
one
of
the
attendants
to
him
by
saying
is
a
person
outside
who
seems
to
be
really
ill
and
to
require
some
help
though
he
says
he
does
not
lightwood
had
by
this
time
secured
their
places
and
the
was
about
to
be
rung
they
took
their
seats
and
were
beginning
to
move
out
of
the
station
when
the
same
attendant
came
running
along
the
platform
looking
into
all
the
carriages
you
are
here
sir
he
said
springing
on
the
step
and
holding
the
by
his
elbow
as
the
carriage
moved
person
you
pointed
out
to
me
is
in
a
fit
infer
from
what
he
told
me
that
he
is
subject
to
such
attacks
he
will
come
to
in
the
air
in
a
little
while
he
was
took
very
bad
to
be
sure
and
was
biting
and
knocking
about
him
the
man
said
furiously
would
the
gentleman
give
him
his
card
as
he
had
seen
him
first
the
gentleman
did
so
with
the
explanation
that
he
knew
no
more
of
the
man
attacked
than
that
he
was
a
man
of
a
very
respectable
occupation
who
had
said
he
was
out
of
health
as
his
appearance
would
of
itself
have
indicated
the
attendant
received
the
card
watched
his
opportunity
for
sliding
down
slid
down
and
so
it
ended
then
the
train
rattled
among
the
and
among
the
ragged
sides
of
houses
torn
down
to
make
way
for
it
and
over
the
swarming
streets
and
under
the
fruitful
earth
until
it
shot
across
the
river
bursting
over
the
quiet
surface
like
a
and
gone
again
as
if
it
had
exploded
in
the
rush
of
smoke
and
steam
and
glare
a
little
more
and
again
it
roared
across
the
river
a
great
rocket
spurning
the
watery
turnings
and
doublings
with
ineffable
contempt
and
going
straight
to
its
end
as
father
time
goes
to
his
to
whom
it
is
no
matter
what
living
waters
run
high
or
low
reflect
the
heavenly
lights
and
darknesses
produce
their
little
growth
of
weeds
and
flowers
turn
here
turn
there
are
noisy
or
still
are
troubled
or
at
rest
for
their
course
has
one
sure
termination
though
their
sources
and
devices
are
many
then
a
carriage
ride
succeeded
near
the
solemn
river
stealing
away
by
night
as
all
things
steal
away
by
night
and
by
day
so
quietly
yielding
to
the
attraction
of
the
loadstone
rock
of
eternity
and
the
nearer
they
drew
to
the
chamber
where
eugene
lay
the
more
they
feared
that
they
might
find
his
wanderings
done
at
last
they
saw
its
dim
light
shining
out
and
it
gave
them
hope
though
lightwood
faltered
as
he
thought
he
were
gone
she
would
still
be
sitting
by
him
but
he
lay
quiet
half
in
stupor
half
in
sleep
bella
entering
with
a
raised
admonitory
finger
kissed
lizzie
softly
but
said
not
a
word
neither
did
any
of
them
speak
but
all
sat
down
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
silently
waiting
and
now
in
this
mingling
with
the
flow
of
the
river
and
with
the
rush
of
the
train
came
the
questions
into
bella
mind
again
what
could
be
in
the
depths
of
that
mystery
of
john
why
was
it
that
he
had
never
been
seen
by
mr
lightwood
whom
he
still
avoided
when
would
that
trial
come
through
which
her
faith
in
and
her
duty
to
her
dear
husband
was
to
carry
her
rendering
him
triumphant
for
that
had
been
his
term
her
passing
through
the
trial
was
to
make
the
man
she
loved
with
all
her
heart
triumphant
term
not
to
sink
out
of
sight
in
bella
breast
far
on
in
the
night
eugene
opened
his
eyes
he
was
sensible
and
said
at
once
does
the
time
go
has
our
mortimer
come
back
lightwood
was
there
immediately
to
answer
for
himself
eugene
and
all
is
ready
boy
returned
eugene
with
a
smile
both
thank
you
heartily
lizzie
tell
them
how
welcome
they
are
and
that
i
would
be
eloquent
if
i
could
is
no
need
said
mr
milvey
know
it
are
you
better
mr
wrayburn
am
much
happier
said
eugene
better
too
i
hope
eugene
turned
his
eyes
towards
lizzie
as
if
to
spare
her
and
answered
nothing
then
they
all
stood
around
the
bed
and
mr
milvey
opening
his
book
began
the
service
so
rarely
associated
with
the
shadow
of
death
so
inseparable
in
the
mind
from
a
flush
of
life
and
gaiety
and
hope
and
health
and
joy
bella
thought
how
different
from
her
own
sunny
little
wedding
and
wept
mrs
milvey
overflowed
with
pity
and
wept
too
the
dolls
dressmaker
with
her
hands
before
her
face
wept
in
her
golden
bower
reading
in
a
low
clear
voice
and
bending
over
eugene
who
kept
his
eyes
upon
him
mr
milvey
did
his
office
with
suitable
simplicity
as
the
bridegroom
could
not
move
his
hand
they
touched
his
fingers
with
the
ring
and
so
put
it
on
the
bride
when
the
two
plighted
their
troth
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
and
kept
it
there
when
the
ceremony
was
done
and
all
the
rest
departed
from
the
room
she
drew
her
arm
under
his
head
and
laid
her
own
head
down
upon
the
pillow
by
his
side
the
curtains
my
dear
girl
said
eugene
after
a
while
let
us
see
our
the
sun
was
rising
and
his
first
rays
struck
into
the
room
as
she
came
back
and
put
her
lips
to
his
bless
the
day
said
eugene
bless
the
day
said
lizzie
have
made
a
poor
marriage
of
it
my
sweet
wife
said
eugene
shattered
graceless
fellow
stretched
at
his
length
here
and
next
to
nothing
for
you
when
you
are
a
young
widow
have
made
the
marriage
that
i
would
have
given
all
the
world
to
dare
to
hope
for
she
replied
have
thrown
yourself
away
said
eugene
shaking
his
head
you
have
followed
the
treasure
of
your
heart
my
justification
is
that
you
had
thrown
that
away
first
dear
girl
i
had
given
it
to
you
same
thing
my
poor
lizzie
hush
a
very
different
thing
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
and
she
besought
him
to
close
them
said
eugene
again
shaking
his
head
me
look
at
you
lizzie
while
i
can
you
brave
devoted
girl
you
heroine
her
own
eyes
filled
under
his
praises
and
when
he
mustered
strength
to
move
his
wounded
head
a
very
little
way
and
lay
it
on
her
bosom
the
tears
of
both
fell
said
eugene
after
a
silence
you
see
me
wandering
away
from
this
refuge
that
i
have
so
ill
deserved
speak
to
me
by
my
name
and
i
think
i
shall
come
back
dear
eugene
he
exclaimed
smiling
should
have
gone
then
but
for
that
a
little
while
afterwards
when
he
appeared
to
be
sinking
into
insensibility
she
said
in
a
calm
loving
voice
my
dear
husband
he
immediately
answered
again
you
see
how
you
can
recall
me
and
afterwards
when
he
could
not
speak
he
still
answered
by
a
slight
movement
of
his
head
upon
her
bosom
the
sun
was
high
in
the
sky
when
she
gently
disengaged
herself
to
give
him
the
stimulants
and
nourishment
he
required
the
utter
helplessness
of
the
wreck
of
him
that
lay
cast
ashore
there
now
alarmed
her
but
he
himself
appeared
a
little
more
hopeful
my
beloved
lizzie
he
said
faintly
shall
i
ever
pay
all
i
owe
you
if
i
recover
be
ashamed
of
me
she
replied
you
will
have
more
than
paid
all
would
require
a
life
lizzie
to
pay
all
more
than
a
life
for
that
then
live
for
me
eugene
live
to
see
how
hard
i
will
try
to
improve
myself
and
never
to
discredit
you
darling
girl
he
replied
rallying
more
of
his
old
manner
than
he
had
ever
yet
got
together
the
contrary
i
have
been
thinking
whether
it
is
not
the
best
thing
i
can
do
to
die
best
thing
you
can
do
to
leave
me
with
a
broken
heart
do
mean
that
my
dear
girl
i
was
not
thinking
of
that
what
i
was
thinking
of
was
this
out
of
your
compassion
for
me
in
this
maimed
and
broken
state
you
make
so
much
of
me
you
think
so
well
of
me
you
love
me
so
dearly
knows
i
love
you
dearly
heaven
knows
i
prize
it
well
if
i
live
you
find
me
out
shall
find
out
that
my
husband
has
a
mine
of
purpose
and
energy
and
will
turn
it
to
the
best
account
hope
so
dearest
lizzie
said
eugene
wistfully
and
yet
somewhat
whimsically
hope
so
but
i
ca
summon
the
vanity
to
think
so
how
can
i
think
so
looking
back
on
such
a
trifling
wasted
youth
as
mine
i
humbly
hope
it
but
i
dare
believe
it
there
is
a
sharp
misgiving
in
my
conscience
that
if
i
were
to
live
i
should
disappoint
your
good
opinion
and
my
own
and
that
i
ought
to
die
my
dear
chapter
the
passing
shadow
the
winds
and
tides
rose
and
fell
a
certain
number
of
times
the
earth
moved
round
the
sun
a
certain
number
of
times
the
ship
upon
the
ocean
made
her
voyage
safely
and
brought
a
home
then
who
so
blest
and
happy
as
mrs
john
rokesmith
saving
and
excepting
mr
john
rokesmith
you
not
like
to
be
rich
now
my
darling
can
you
ask
me
such
a
question
john
dear
am
i
not
rich
these
were
among
the
first
words
spoken
near
the
baby
bella
as
she
lay
asleep
she
soon
proved
to
be
a
baby
of
wonderful
intelligence
evincing
the
strongest
objection
to
her
grandmother
society
and
being
invariably
seized
with
a
painful
acidity
of
the
stomach
when
that
dignified
lady
honoured
her
with
any
attention
it
was
charming
to
see
bella
contemplating
this
baby
and
finding
out
her
own
dimples
in
that
tiny
reflection
as
if
she
were
looking
in
the
glass
without
personal
vanity
her
cherubic
father
justly
remarked
to
her
husband
that
the
baby
seemed
to
make
her
younger
than
before
reminding
him
of
the
days
when
she
had
a
pet
doll
and
used
to
talk
to
it
as
she
carried
it
about
the
world
might
have
been
challenged
to
produce
another
baby
who
had
such
a
store
of
pleasant
nonsense
said
and
sung
to
it
as
bella
said
and
sung
to
this
baby
or
who
was
dressed
and
undressed
as
often
in
hours
as
bella
dressed
and
undressed
this
baby
or
who
was
held
behind
doors
and
poked
out
to
stop
its
father
way
when
he
came
home
as
this
baby
was
or
in
a
word
who
did
half
the
number
of
baby
things
through
the
lively
invention
of
a
gay
and
proud
young
mother
that
this
inexhaustible
baby
did
the
inexhaustible
baby
was
two
or
three
months
old
when
bella
began
to
notice
a
cloud
upon
her
husband
brow
watching
it
she
saw
a
gathering
and
deepening
anxiety
there
which
caused
her
great
disquiet
more
than
once
she
awoke
him
muttering
in
his
sleep
and
though
he
muttered
nothing
worse
than
her
own
name
it
was
plain
to
her
that
his
restlessness
originated
in
some
load
of
care
therefore
bella
at
length
put
in
her
claim
to
divide
this
load
and
hear
her
half
of
it
know
john
dear
she
said
cheerily
reverting
to
their
former
conversation
i
hope
i
may
safely
be
trusted
in
great
things
and
it
surely
can
not
be
a
little
thing
that
causes
you
so
much
uneasiness
it
very
considerate
of
you
to
try
to
hide
from
me
that
you
are
uncomfortable
about
something
but
it
quite
impossible
to
be
done
john
love
admit
that
i
am
rather
uneasy
my
own
please
to
tell
me
what
about
sir
but
no
he
evaded
that
mind
thought
bella
resolutely
requires
me
to
put
perfect
faith
in
him
and
he
shall
not
be
disappointed
she
went
up
to
london
one
day
to
meet
him
in
order
that
they
might
make
some
purchases
she
found
him
waiting
for
her
at
her
end
and
they
walked
away
together
through
the
streets
he
was
in
gay
spirits
though
still
harping
on
that
notion
of
their
being
rich
and
he
said
now
let
them
make
believe
that
yonder
fine
carriage
was
theirs
and
that
it
was
waiting
to
take
them
home
to
a
fine
house
they
had
what
would
bella
in
that
case
best
like
to
find
in
the
house
well
bella
did
know
already
having
everything
she
wanted
she
could
say
but
by
degrees
she
was
led
on
to
confess
that
she
would
like
to
have
for
the
inexhaustible
baby
such
a
nursery
as
never
was
seen
it
was
to
be
very
rainbow
for
colours
as
she
was
quite
sure
baby
noticed
colours
and
the
staircase
was
to
be
adorned
with
the
most
exquisite
flowers
as
she
was
absolutely
certain
baby
noticed
flowers
and
there
was
to
be
an
aviary
somewhere
of
the
loveliest
little
birds
as
there
was
not
the
smallest
doubt
in
the
world
that
baby
noticed
birds
was
there
nothing
else
no
john
dear
the
predilections
of
the
inexhaustible
baby
being
provided
for
bella
could
think
of
nothing
else
they
were
chatting
on
in
this
way
and
john
had
suggested
jewels
for
your
own
wear
for
instance
and
bella
had
replied
laughing
o
if
he
came
to
that
yes
there
might
be
a
beautiful
ivory
case
of
jewels
on
her
when
these
pictures
were
in
a
moment
darkened
and
blotted
out
they
turned
a
corner
and
met
mr
lightwood
he
stopped
as
if
he
were
petrified
by
the
sight
of
bella
husband
who
in
the
same
moment
had
changed
colour
lightwood
and
i
have
met
before
he
said
before
john
bella
repeated
in
a
tone
of
wonder
lightwood
told
me
he
had
never
seen
you
did
not
then
know
that
i
had
said
lightwood
discomposed
on
her
account
believed
that
i
had
only
heard
of
mr
rokesmith
with
an
emphasis
on
the
name
mr
lightwood
saw
me
my
love
observed
her
husband
not
avoiding
his
eye
but
looking
at
him
name
was
julius
handford
julius
handford
the
name
that
bella
had
so
often
seen
in
old
newspapers
when
she
was
an
inmate
of
mr
boffin
house
julius
handford
who
had
been
publicly
entreated
to
appear
and
for
intelligence
of
whom
a
reward
had
been
publicly
offered
would
have
avoided
mentioning
it
in
your
presence
said
lightwood
to
bella
delicately
since
your
husband
mentions
it
himself
i
must
confirm
his
strange
admission
i
saw
him
as
mr
julius
handford
and
i
afterwards
unquestionably
to
his
knowledge
took
great
pains
to
trace
him
out
true
but
it
was
not
my
object
or
my
interest
said
rokesmith
quietly
be
traced
out
bella
looked
from
the
one
to
the
other
in
amazement
lightwood
pursued
her
husband
chance
has
brought
us
face
to
face
at
last
which
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
for
the
wonder
is
that
in
spite
of
all
my
pains
to
the
contrary
chance
has
not
confronted
us
together
sooner
i
have
only
to
remind
you
that
you
have
been
at
my
house
and
to
add
that
i
have
not
changed
my
residence
returned
lightwood
with
a
meaning
glance
towards
bella
position
is
a
truly
painful
one
i
hope
that
no
complicity
in
a
very
dark
transaction
may
attach
to
you
but
you
can
not
fail
to
know
that
your
own
extraordinary
conduct
has
laid
you
under
suspicion
know
it
has
was
all
the
reply
professional
duty
said
lightwood
hesitating
with
another
glance
towards
bella
greatly
at
variance
with
my
personal
inclination
but
i
doubt
mr
handford
or
mr
rokesmith
whether
i
am
justified
in
taking
leave
of
you
here
with
your
whole
course
unexplained
bella
caught
her
husband
by
the
hand
be
alarmed
my
darling
mr
lightwood
will
find
that
he
is
quite
justified
in
taking
leave
of
me
here
at
all
events
added
rokesmith
will
find
that
i
mean
to
take
leave
of
him
here
think
sir
said
lightwood
can
scarcely
deny
that
when
i
came
to
your
house
on
the
occasion
to
which
you
have
referred
you
avoided
me
of
a
set
purpose
lightwood
i
assure
you
i
have
no
disposition
to
deny
it
or
intention
to
deny
it
i
should
have
continued
to
avoid
you
in
pursuance
of
the
same
set
purpose
for
a
short
time
longer
if
we
had
not
met
now
i
am
going
straight
home
and
shall
remain
at
home
until
noon
hereafter
i
hope
we
may
be
better
acquainted
lightwood
stood
irresolute
but
bella
husband
passed
him
in
the
steadiest
manner
with
bella
on
his
arm
and
they
went
home
without
encountering
any
further
remonstrance
or
molestation
from
any
one
when
they
had
dined
and
were
alone
john
rokesmith
said
to
his
wife
who
had
preserved
her
cheerfulness
you
do
ask
me
my
dear
why
i
bore
that
name
john
love
i
should
dearly
like
to
know
of
course
which
her
anxious
face
confirmed
i
wait
until
you
can
tell
me
of
your
own
free
will
you
asked
me
if
i
could
have
perfect
faith
in
you
and
i
said
yes
and
i
meant
it
it
did
not
escape
bella
notice
that
he
began
to
look
triumphant
she
wanted
no
strengthening
in
her
firmness
but
if
she
had
had
need
of
any
she
would
have
derived
it
from
his
kindling
face
can
not
have
been
prepared
my
dearest
for
such
a
discovery
as
that
this
mysterious
mr
handford
was
identical
with
your
husband
john
dear
of
course
not
but
you
told
me
to
prepare
to
be
tried
and
i
prepared
myself
he
drew
her
to
nestle
closer
to
him
and
told
her
it
would
soon
be
over
and
the
truth
would
soon
appear
now
he
went
on
stress
my
dear
on
these
words
that
i
am
going
to
add
i
stand
in
no
kind
of
peril
and
i
can
by
possibility
be
hurt
at
no
one
hand
are
quite
quite
sure
of
that
john
dear
a
hair
of
my
head
moreover
i
have
done
no
wrong
and
have
injured
no
man
shall
i
swear
it
john
cried
bella
laying
her
hand
upon
his
lips
with
a
proud
look
to
me
circumstances
he
went
on
i
can
and
i
will
disperse
them
in
a
moment
have
surrounded
me
with
one
of
the
strangest
suspicions
ever
known
you
heard
mr
lightwood
speak
of
a
dark
transaction
john
are
prepared
to
hear
explicitly
what
he
meant
john
life
he
meant
the
murder
of
john
harmon
your
allotted
husband
with
a
fast
palpitating
heart
bella
grasped
him
by
the
arm
can
not
be
suspected
john
love
i
can
be
for
i
am
there
was
silence
between
them
as
she
sat
looking
in
his
face
with
the
colour
quite
gone
from
her
own
face
and
lips
dare
they
she
cried
at
length
in
a
burst
of
generous
indignation
beloved
husband
how
dare
they
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
as
she
opened
hers
and
held
her
to
his
heart
knowing
this
you
can
trust
me
bella
can
trust
you
john
dear
with
all
my
soul
if
i
could
not
trust
you
i
should
fall
dead
at
your
feet
the
kindling
triumph
in
his
face
was
bright
indeed
as
he
looked
up
and
rapturously
exclaimed
what
had
he
done
to
deserve
the
blessing
of
this
dear
confiding
creature
heart
again
she
put
her
hand
upon
his
lips
saying
and
then
told
him
in
her
own
little
natural
pathetic
way
that
if
all
the
world
were
against
him
she
would
be
for
him
that
if
all
the
world
repudiated
him
she
would
believe
him
that
if
he
were
infamous
in
other
eyes
he
would
be
honoured
in
hers
and
that
under
the
worst
unmerited
suspicion
she
could
devote
her
life
to
consoling
him
and
imparting
her
own
faith
in
him
to
their
little
child
a
twilight
calm
of
happiness
then
succeeding
to
their
radiant
noon
they
remained
at
peace
until
a
strange
voice
in
the
room
startled
them
both
the
room
being
by
that
time
dark
the
voice
said
let
the
lady
be
alarmed
by
my
striking
a
light
and
immediately
a
match
rattled
and
glimmered
in
a
hand
the
hand
and
the
match
and
the
voice
were
then
seen
by
john
rokesmith
to
belong
to
mr
inspector
once
meditatively
active
in
this
chronicle
take
the
liberty
said
mr
inspector
in
a
manner
bring
myself
to
the
recollection
of
mr
julius
handford
who
gave
me
his
name
and
address
down
at
our
place
a
considerable
time
ago
would
the
lady
object
to
my
lighting
the
pair
of
candles
on
the
chimneypiece
to
throw
a
further
light
upon
the
subject
no
thank
you
now
we
look
cheerful
mr
inspector
in
a
frock
coat
and
pantaloons
presented
a
serviceable
royal
arms
kind
of
appearance
as
he
applied
his
pocket
handkerchief
to
his
nose
and
bowed
to
the
lady
favoured
me
mr
handford
said
mr
inspector
writing
down
your
name
and
address
and
i
produce
the
piece
of
paper
on
which
you
wrote
it
comparing
the
same
with
the
writing
on
the
of
this
book
on
the
table
and
a
sweet
pretty
volume
it
is
i
find
the
writing
of
the
entry
mrs
john
rokesmith
from
her
husband
on
her
birthday
and
very
gratifying
to
the
feelings
such
memorials
are
to
correspond
exactly
can
i
have
a
word
with
you
here
if
you
please
was
the
reply
retorted
mr
inspector
again
using
his
pocket
handkerchief
there
nothing
for
the
lady
to
be
at
all
alarmed
at
still
ladies
are
apt
to
take
alarm
at
matters
of
business
being
of
that
fragile
sex
that
they
not
accustomed
to
them
when
not
of
a
strictly
domestic
character
and
i
do
generally
make
it
a
rule
to
propose
retirement
from
the
presence
of
ladies
before
entering
upon
business
topics
or
perhaps
mr
inspector
hinted
the
lady
was
to
step
and
take
a
look
at
baby
now
rokesmith
her
husband
was
beginning
when
mr
inspector
regarding
the
words
as
an
introduction
said
i
am
sure
to
have
the
honour
and
bowed
with
gallantry
rokesmith
resumed
her
husband
satisfied
that
she
can
have
no
reason
for
being
alarmed
whatever
the
business
is
is
that
so
said
mr
inspector
it
a
sex
to
live
and
learn
from
and
there
nothing
a
lady
ca
accomplish
when
she
once
fully
gives
her
mind
to
it
it
the
case
with
my
own
wife
well
this
good
gentleman
of
yours
has
given
rise
to
a
rather
large
amount
of
trouble
which
might
have
been
avoided
if
he
had
come
forward
and
explained
himself
well
you
see
he
did
come
forward
and
explain
himself
consequently
now
that
we
meet
him
and
me
you
say
and
say
right
that
there
nothing
to
be
alarmed
at
in
my
proposing
to
him
to
come
forward
or
putting
the
same
meaning
in
another
form
to
come
along
with
me
and
explain
himself
when
mr
inspector
put
it
in
that
other
form
come
along
with
me
there
was
a
relishing
roll
in
his
voice
and
his
eye
beamed
with
an
official
lustre
you
propose
to
take
me
into
custody
inquired
john
rokesmith
very
coolly
argue
returned
mr
inspector
in
a
comfortable
sort
of
remonstrance
it
enough
that
i
propose
that
you
shall
come
along
with
me
what
reason
bless
my
soul
and
body
returned
mr
inspector
wonder
at
it
in
a
man
of
your
education
why
argue
do
you
charge
against
me
wonder
at
you
before
a
lady
said
mr
inspector
shaking
his
head
reproachfully
wonder
brought
up
as
you
have
been
you
have
a
more
delicate
mind
i
charge
you
then
with
being
some
way
concerned
in
the
harmon
murder
i
do
say
whether
before
or
in
or
after
the
fact
i
do
say
whether
with
having
some
knowledge
of
it
that
come
out
do
surprise
me
i
foresaw
your
visit
this
afternoon
said
mr
inspector
why
argue
it
my
duty
to
inform
you
that
whatever
you
say
will
be
used
against
you
do
think
it
will
i
tell
you
it
will
said
mr
inspector
having
received
the
caution
do
you
still
say
that
you
foresaw
my
visit
this
afternoon
and
i
will
say
something
more
if
you
will
step
with
me
into
the
next
room
with
a
reassuring
kiss
on
the
lips
of
the
frightened
bella
her
husband
to
whom
mr
inspector
obligingly
offered
his
arm
took
up
a
candle
and
withdrew
with
that
gentleman
they
were
a
full
in
conference
when
they
returned
mr
inspector
looked
considerably
astonished
have
invited
this
worthy
officer
my
dear
said
john
make
a
short
excursion
with
me
in
which
you
shall
be
a
sharer
he
will
take
something
to
eat
and
drink
i
dare
say
on
your
invitation
while
you
are
getting
your
bonnet
on
mr
inspector
declined
eating
but
assented
to
the
proposal
of
a
glass
of
brandy
and
water
mixing
this
cold
and
pensively
consuming
it
he
broke
at
intervals
into
such
soliloquies
as
that
he
never
did
know
such
a
move
that
he
never
had
been
so
gravelled
and
that
what
a
game
was
this
to
try
the
sort
of
stuff
a
man
opinion
of
himself
was
made
of
concurrently
with
these
comments
he
more
than
once
burst
out
a
laughing
with
the
and
air
of
a
man
who
had
given
up
a
good
conundrum
after
much
guessing
and
been
told
the
answer
bella
was
so
timid
of
him
that
she
noted
these
things
in
a
way
and
similarly
noted
that
there
was
a
great
change
in
his
manner
towards
john
that
deportment
was
now
lost
in
long
musing
looks
at
john
and
at
herself
and
sometimes
in
slow
heavy
rubs
of
his
hand
across
his
forehead
as
if
he
were
ironing
cut
the
creases
which
his
deep
pondering
made
there
he
had
had
some
coughing
and
whistling
satellites
secretly
gravitating
towards
him
about
the
premises
but
they
were
now
dismissed
and
he
eyed
john
as
if
he
had
meant
to
do
him
a
public
service
but
had
unfortunately
been
anticipated
whether
bella
might
have
noted
anything
more
if
she
had
been
less
afraid
of
him
she
could
not
determine
but
it
was
all
inexplicable
to
her
and
not
the
faintest
flash
of
the
real
state
of
the
case
broke
in
upon
her
mind
mr
inspector
increased
notice
of
herself
and
knowing
way
of
raising
his
eyebrows
when
their
eyes
by
any
chance
met
as
if
he
put
the
question
you
see
augmented
her
timidity
and
consequently
her
perplexity
for
all
these
reasons
when
he
and
she
and
john
at
towards
nine
of
a
winter
evening
went
to
london
and
began
driving
from
london
bridge
among
wharves
and
docks
and
strange
places
bella
was
in
the
state
of
a
dreamer
perfectly
unable
to
account
for
her
being
there
perfectly
unable
to
forecast
what
would
happen
next
or
whither
she
was
going
or
why
certain
of
nothing
in
the
immediate
present
but
that
she
confided
in
john
and
that
john
seemed
somehow
to
be
getting
more
triumphant
but
what
a
certainty
was
that
they
alighted
at
last
at
the
corner
of
a
court
where
there
was
a
building
with
a
bright
lamp
and
wicket
gate
its
orderly
appearance
was
very
unlike
that
of
the
surrounding
neighbourhood
and
was
explained
by
the
inscription
police
station
are
not
going
in
here
john
said
bella
clinging
to
him
my
dear
but
of
our
own
accord
we
shall
come
out
again
as
easily
never
fear
the
whitewashed
room
was
pure
white
as
of
old
the
methodical
was
in
peaceful
progress
as
of
old
and
some
distant
howler
was
banging
against
a
cell
door
as
of
old
the
sanctuary
was
not
a
permanent
but
a
kind
of
criminal
pickford
the
lower
passions
and
vices
were
regularly
ticked
off
in
the
books
warehoused
in
the
cells
carted
away
as
per
accompanying
invoice
and
left
little
mark
upon
it
mr
inspector
placed
two
chairs
for
his
visitors
before
the
fire
and
communed
in
a
low
voice
with
a
brother
of
his
order
also
of
a
and
royal
arms
aspect
who
judged
only
by
his
occupation
at
the
moment
might
have
been
a
setting
copies
their
conference
done
mr
inspector
returned
to
the
fireplace
and
having
observed
that
he
would
step
round
to
the
fellowships
and
see
how
matters
stood
went
out
he
soon
came
back
again
saying
could
be
better
for
they
at
supper
with
miss
abbey
in
the
bar
and
then
they
all
three
went
out
together
still
as
in
a
dream
bella
found
herself
entering
a
snug
and
found
herself
smuggled
into
a
little
room
nearly
opposite
the
bar
of
that
establishment
mr
inspector
achieved
the
smuggling
of
herself
and
john
into
this
queer
room
called
cosy
in
an
inscription
on
the
door
by
entering
in
the
narrow
passage
first
in
order
and
suddenly
turning
round
upon
them
with
extended
arms
as
if
they
had
been
two
sheep
the
room
was
lighted
for
their
reception
said
mr
inspector
to
john
turning
the
gas
lower
mix
with
in
a
casual
way
and
when
i
say
identification
perhaps
you
show
yourself
john
nodded
and
mr
inspector
went
alone
to
the
of
the
bar
from
the
dim
doorway
of
cosy
within
which
bella
and
her
husband
stood
they
could
see
a
comfortable
little
party
of
three
persons
sitting
at
supper
in
the
bar
and
could
hear
everything
that
was
said
the
three
persons
were
miss
abbey
and
two
male
guests
to
whom
collectively
mr
inspector
remarked
that
the
weather
was
getting
sharp
for
the
time
of
year

be
sharp
to
suit
your
wits

for
half
a
moment
they
waiting
said
miss
abbey

mr
inspector
immediately
slipped
into
the
bar
and
sat
down
at
the
side
of
the
with
his
back
towards
the
passage
and
directly
facing
the
two
guests
do
take
my
supper
till
later
in
the
night

he
therefore

i
shall
be
glad
to

where
filling
him
with
hospitable
hands
a
steaming
tumbler
miss
abbey
replaced
the
jug
by
the
fire
the
company
not
having
yet
arrived
at
the
of
their
supper
but
being
as
yet
skirmishing
with
strong
ale
h
cried
mr
inspector
the
smack
there
not
a
detective
in
the
force
miss
abbey
that
could
find
out
better
stuff
than
that
to
hear
you
say

rejoined
miss
abbey
ought
to
know
if
anybody
does
job
potterson
mr
inspector
continued
drink
your
health
mr
jacob
kibble
i
drink
yours
hope

have
made
a
prosperous
voyage
home
gentlemen
both
mr
kibble
an
unctuous
broad
man
of
few
words
and
many
mouthfuls
said
more
briefly
than
pointedly
raising
his
ale
to
his
lips
to
you
mr
job
potterson
a
man
of
obliging
demeanour
said
you
sir
bless
my
soul
and
body
cried
mr
inspector
of
trades
miss
abbey
and
the
way
they
set
their
marks
on
men
a
subject
which
nobody
had
approached
would
know
your
brother
to
be
a
steward
there
a
bright
and
ready
twinkle
in
his
eye
there
a
neatness
in
his
action
there
a
smartness
in
his
figure
there
an
air
of
reliability
about
him
in
case
you
wanted
a
basin
which
points
out
the
steward
and
mr
kibble
ai
he
passenger
all
over
while
there
that
mercantile
cut
upon
him
which
would
make
you
happy
to
give
him
credit
for
five
hundred
pound
do
you
see
the
salt
sea
shining
on
him
too
do
i
dare
say
returned
miss
abbey
i
do
and
as
for
stewarding
i
think
it
time
my
brother
gave
that
up
and
took
his
house
in
hand
on
his
sister
retiring
the
house
will
go
to
pieces
if
he
do
i
would
sell
it
for
any
money
that
could
be
told
out
to
a
person
that
i
could
depend
upon
to
be
a
law
to
the
porters
as
i
have
been
you
right
miss
said
mr
inspector
better
kept
house
is
not
known
to
our
men
what
do
i
say
half
so
well
a
kept
house
is
not
known
to
our
men
show
the
force
the
six
jolly
fellowship
porters
and
the
force
to
a
constable
will
show
you
a
piece
of
perfection
mr
kibble
that
gentleman
with
a
very
serious
shake
of
his
head
subscribed
the
article
talk
of
time
slipping
by
you
as
if
it
was
an
animal
at
rustic
sports
with
its
tail
soaped
said
mr
inspector
again
a
subject
which
nobody
had
approached
well
you
may
well
you
may
how
has
it
slipped
by
us
since
the
time
when
mr
job
potterson
here
present
mr
jacob
kibble
here
present
and
an
officer
of
the
force
here
present
first
came
together
on
a
matter
of
identification
bella
husband
stepped
softly
to
the
of
the
bar
and
stood
there
has
time
slipped
by
us
mr
inspector
went
on
slowly
with
his
eyes
narrowly
observant
of
the
two
guests
we
three
very
men
at
an
inquest
in
this
very
house
mr
kibble
taken
ill
sir
mr
kibble
had
staggered
up
with
his
lower
jaw
dropped
catching
potterson
by
the
shoulder
and
pointing
to
the
he
now
cried
out
look
look
there
potterson
started
up
started
back
and
exclaimed
defend
us
what
that
bella
husband
stepped
back
to
bella
took
her
in
his
arms
for
she
was
terrified
by
the
unintelligible
terror
of
the
two
men
and
shut
the
door
of
the
little
room
a
hurry
of
voices
succeeded
in
which
mr
inspector
voice
was
busiest
it
gradually
slackened
and
sank
and
mr
inspector
reappeared
the
word
sir
he
said
looking
in
with
a
knowing
wink
get
your
lady
out
at
once
immediately
bella
and
her
husband
were
under
the
stars
making
their
way
back
alone
to
the
vehicle
they
had
kept
in
waiting
all
this
was
most
extraordinary
and
bella
could
make
nothing
of
it
but
that
john
was
in
the
right
how
in
the
right
and
how
suspected
of
being
in
the
wrong
she
could
not
divine
some
vague
idea
that
he
had
never
really
assumed
the
name
of
handford
and
that
there
was
a
remarkable
likeness
between
him
and
that
mysterious
person
was
her
nearest
approach
to
any
definite
explanation
but
john
was
triumphant
that
much
was
made
apparent
and
she
could
wait
for
the
rest
when
john
came
home
to
dinner
next
day
he
said
sitting
down
on
the
sofa
by
bella
and
dear
i
have
a
piece
of
news
to
tell
you
i
have
left
the
china
house
as
he
seemed
to
like
having
left
it
bella
took
it
for
granted
that
there
was
no
misfortune
in
the
case
a
word
my
love
said
john
china
house
is
broken
up
and
abolished
there
is
no
such
thing
any
more
are
you
already
in
another
house
john
my
darling
i
am
in
another
way
of
business
and
i
am
rather
better
off
the
inexhaustible
baby
was
instantly
made
to
congratulate
him
and
to
say
with
appropriate
action
on
the
part
of
a
very
limp
arm
and
a
speckled
fist
cheers
ladies
and
gemplemorums
hoo
ray
am
afraid
my
life
said
john
you
have
become
very
much
attached
to
this
cottage
i
have
john
of
course
i
have
reason
why
i
said
afraid
returned
john
because
we
must
move
john
my
dear
we
must
move
we
must
have
our
in
london
now
in
short
there
a
attached
to
my
new
position
and
we
must
occupy
it
a
gain
john
my
dear
it
is
undoubtedly
a
gain
he
gave
her
a
very
blithe
look
and
a
very
sly
look
which
occasioned
the
inexhaustible
baby
to
square
at
him
with
the
speckled
fists
and
demand
in
a
threatening
manner
what
he
meant
love
you
said
it
was
a
gain
and
i
said
it
was
a
gain
a
very
innocent
remark
surely
wo
said
the
inexhaustible
baby
allow
you
to
make
game
of
my
venerable
ma
at
each
division
administering
a
soft
facer
with
one
of
the
speckled
fists
john
having
stooped
down
to
receive
these
punishing
visitations
bella
asked
him
would
it
be
necessary
to
move
soon
why
yes
indeed
said
john
he
did
propose
that
they
should
move
very
soon
taking
the
furniture
with
them
of
course
said
bella
why
no
said
john
the
fact
was
that
the
house
was
in
a
sort
of
a
kind
of
a
way
furnished
already
the
inexhaustible
baby
hearing
this
resumed
the
offensive
and
said
there
no
nursery
for
me
sir
what
do
you
mean
parent
to
which
the
parent
rejoined
that
there
was
a
sort
of
a
kind
of
a
nursery
and
it
might
be
to
do
to
do
returned
the
inexhaustible
administering
more
punishment
do
you
take
me
for
and
was
then
turned
over
on
its
back
in
bella
lap
and
smothered
with
kisses
really
john
dear
said
bella
flushed
in
quite
a
lovely
manner
by
these
exercises
the
new
house
just
as
it
stands
do
for
baby
that
the
question
felt
that
to
be
the
question
he
returned
therefore
i
arranged
that
you
should
come
with
me
and
look
at
it
morning
appointment
made
accordingly
for
bella
to
go
up
with
him
morning
john
kissed
and
bella
delighted
when
they
reached
london
in
pursuance
of
their
little
plan
they
took
coach
and
drove
westward
not
only
drove
westward
but
drove
into
that
particular
westward
division
which
bella
had
seen
last
when
she
turned
her
face
from
mr
boffin
door
not
only
drove
into
that
particular
division
but
drove
at
last
into
that
very
street
not
only
drove
into
that
very
street
but
stopped
at
last
at
that
very
house
dear
cried
bella
looking
out
of
window
in
a
flutter
you
see
where
we
are
my
love
the
coachman
quite
right
the
was
opened
without
any
knocking
or
ringing
and
john
promptly
helped
her
out
the
servant
who
stood
holding
the
door
asked
no
question
of
john
neither
did
he
go
before
them
or
follow
them
as
they
went
straight
it
was
only
her
husband
encircling
arm
urging
her
on
that
prevented
bella
from
stopping
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
as
they
ascended
it
was
seen
to
be
tastefully
ornamented
with
most
beautiful
flowers
john
said
bella
faintly
does
this
mean
my
darling
nothing
let
us
go
on
going
on
a
little
higher
they
came
to
a
charming
aviary
in
which
a
number
of
tropical
birds
more
gorgeous
in
colour
than
the
flowers
were
flying
about
and
among
those
birds
were
gold
and
silver
fish
and
mosses
and
and
a
fountain
and
all
manner
of
wonders
my
dear
john
said
bella
does
this
mean
my
darling
nothing
let
us
go
on
they
went
on
until
they
came
to
a
door
as
john
put
out
his
hand
to
open
it
bella
caught
his
hand
do
know
what
it
means
but
it
too
much
for
me
hold
me
john
love
john
caught
her
up
in
his
arm
and
lightly
dashed
into
the
room
with
her
behold
mr
and
mrs
boffin
beaming
behold
mrs
boffin
clapping
her
hands
in
an
ecstacy
running
to
bella
with
tears
of
joy
pouring
down
her
comely
face
and
folding
her
to
her
breast
with
the
words
deary
deary
deary
girl
that
noddy
and
me
saw
married
and
could
wish
joy
to
or
so
much
as
speak
to
my
deary
deary
deary
wife
of
john
and
mother
of
his
little
child
my
loving
loving
bright
bright
pretty
pretty
welcome
to
your
house
and
home
my
deary
chapter
showing
how
the
golden
dustman
helped
to
scatter
dust
in
all
the
first
bewilderment
of
her
wonder
the
most
bewilderingly
wonderful
thing
to
bella
was
the
shining
countenance
of
mr
boffin
that
his
wife
should
be
joyous
and
genial
or
that
her
face
should
express
every
quality
that
was
large
and
trusting
and
no
quality
that
was
little
or
mean
was
accordant
with
bella
experience
but
that
he
with
a
perfectly
beneficent
air
and
a
plump
rosy
face
should
be
standing
there
looking
at
her
and
john
like
some
jovial
good
spirit
was
marvellous
for
how
had
he
looked
when
she
last
saw
him
in
that
very
room
it
was
the
room
in
which
she
had
given
him
that
piece
of
her
mind
at
parting
and
what
had
become
of
all
those
crooked
lines
of
suspicion
avarice
and
distrust
that
twisted
his
visage
then
mrs
boffin
seated
bella
on
the
large
ottoman
and
seated
herself
beside
her
and
john
her
husband
seated
himself
on
the
other
side
of
her
and
mr
boffin
stood
beaming
at
every
one
and
everything
he
could
see
with
surpassing
jollity
and
enjoyment
mrs
boffin
was
then
taken
with
a
laughing
fit
of
clapping
her
hands
and
clapping
her
knees
and
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
and
then
with
another
laughing
fit
of
embracing
bella
and
rocking
her
to
and
fro
both
fits
of
considerable
duration
lady
old
lady
said
mr
boffin
at
length
you
do
begin
somebody
else
must
a
going
to
begin
noddy
my
dear
returned
mrs
boffin
it
is
easy
for
a
person
to
know
where
to
begin
when
a
person
is
in
this
state
of
delight
and
happiness
bella
my
dear
tell
me
who
this
is
this
repeated
bella
husband
but
tell
me
his
name
deary
cried
mrs
boffin
it
ai
cried
mrs
boffin
clapping
her
hands
and
shaking
her
head
a
bit
of
it
then
suggested
bella
it
ai
cried
mrs
boffin
again
clapping
her
hands
and
shaking
her
head
a
bit
of
it
least
his
name
is
john
i
suppose
said
bella
i
should
think
so
deary
cried
mrs
boffin
should
hope
so
many
and
many
is
the
time
i
have
called
him
by
his
name
of
john
but
what
his
other
name
his
true
other
name
give
a
guess
my
pretty
ca
guess
said
bella
turning
her
pale
face
from
one
to
another
could
cried
mrs
boffin
what
more
i
did
i
found
him
out
all
in
a
flash
as
i
may
say
one
night
did
i
noddy
that
the
old
lady
did
said
mr
boffin
with
stout
pride
in
the
circumstance
to
me
deary
pursued
mrs
boffin
taking
bella
hands
between
her
own
and
gently
beating
on
them
from
time
to
time
was
after
a
particular
night
when
john
had
been
disappointed
as
he
thought
in
his
affections
it
was
after
a
night
when
john
had
made
an
offer
to
a
certain
young
lady
and
the
certain
young
lady
had
refused
it
it
was
after
a
particular
night
when
he
felt
himself
and
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
seek
his
fortune
it
was
the
very
next
night
my
noddy
wanted
a
paper
out
of
his
secretary
room
and
i
says
to
noddy
i
am
going
by
the
door
and
i
ask
him
for
i
tapped
at
his
door
and
he
did
hear
me
i
looked
in
and
saw
him
a
sitting
lonely
by
his
fire
brooding
over
it
he
chanced
to
look
up
with
a
pleased
kind
of
smile
in
my
company
when
he
saw
me
and
then
in
a
single
moment
every
grain
of
the
gunpowder
that
had
been
lying
sprinkled
thick
about
him
ever
since
i
first
set
eyes
upon
him
as
a
man
at
the
bower
took
fire
too
many
a
time
had
i
seen
him
sitting
lonely
when
he
was
a
poor
child
to
be
pitied
heart
and
hand
too
many
a
time
had
i
seen
him
in
need
of
being
brightened
up
with
a
comforting
word
too
many
and
too
many
a
time
to
be
mistaken

mrs
boffin
breaking
off
in
the
rush
of
her
speech
to
smile
most
radiantly
you
think
by
this
time
that
your
husband
name
was

returned
bella
with
quivering
lips
harmon
that
not
possible
tremble
why

deary
when
so
many
things
are
possible
demanded
mrs
boffin
in
a
soothing
tone

by
a
of
secret
arrangement
the
inexhaustible
baby
here
appeared
at
the
door
suspended
in
by
invisible
agency
mrs
boffin
plunging
at
it
brought
it
to
bella
lap
where
both
mrs
and
mr
boffin
as
the
saying
is
it
out
of
the
inexhaustible
in
a
shower
of
caresses
it
was
only
this
timely
appearance
that
kept
bella
from
swooning
this
and
her
husband
earnestness
in
explaining
further
to
her
how
it
had
come
to
pass
that
he
had
been
supposed
to
be
slain
and
had
even
been
suspected
of
his
own
murder
also
how
he
had
put
a
pious
fraud
upon
her
which
had
preyed
upon
his
mind
as
the
time
for
its
disclosure
approached
lest
she
might
not
make
full
allowance
for
the
object
with
which
it
had
originated
and
in
which
it
had
fully
developed
bless

beauty
cried
mrs
boffin
taking

mrs

he
forced
to
let
me
down
noddy
he
hears
a
noise
and
in
he
trots
and
as
soon
as
i
anyways
comes
to
myself
i
calls
to
him
noddy
well
i
might
say
as
i
did
say
that
night
at
the
bower

lord

thankful

is
john
on
which
he
gives
a
heave
and
down
he
goes
likewise
with
his
head
under
the
this
brings
me
round
comfortable
and
that
brings
him
round
comfortable
and
then
john
and

all
fall
a
crying
for
joy
they
cry
for
joy
my
darling
her
husband
struck
in
understand
these
two
whom
i
come
to
life
to
disappoint
and
dispossess
cry
for
joy
bella
looked
at
him
confusedly
and
looked
again
at
mrs
boffin
radiant
face
right
my
dear
do
you
mind
him
said
mrs
boffin
to
me
well
then
we
sits
down
gradually
gets
cool
and
holds
a
confabulation
john
he
tells
us
how
he
is
despairing
in
his
mind
on
accounts
of
a
certain
fair
young
person
and
how
if
i
had
found
him
out
he
was
going
away
to
seek
his
fortune
far
and
wide
and
had
fully
meant
never
to
come
to
life
but
to
leave
the
property
as
our
wrongful
inheritance
for
ever
and
a
day
at
which
you
never
see
a
man
so
frightened
as
my
noddy
was
for
to
think
that
he
should
have
come
into
the
property
wrongful
however
innocent
and
more
than
that
might
have
gone
on
keeping
it
to
his
dying
day
turned
him
whiter
than
chalk
you
too
said
mr
boffin
you
mind
him
neither
my
deary
resumed
mrs
boffin
to
me
this
brings
up
a
confabulation
regarding
the
certain
fair
young
person
when
noddy
he
gives
it
as
his
opinion
that
she
is
a
deary
creetur
she
may
be
a
leetle
spoilt
and
spoilt
he
says
by
circumstances
but
that
only
the
surface
and
i
lay
my
life
he
says
that
she
the
true
golden
gold
at
did
you
said
mr
boffin
you
mind
him
a
single
morsel
my
dear
proceeded
mrs
boffin
stick
to
me
then
says
john
o
if
he
could
but
prove
so
then
we
both
of
us
ups
and
says
that
minute
prove
so
with
a
start
bella
directed
a
hurried
glance
towards
mr
boffin
but
he
was
sitting
thoughtfully
smiling
at
that
broad
brown
hand
of
his
and
either
did
see
it
or
would
take
no
notice
of
it
prove
it
john
we
says
repeated
mrs
boffin
prove
it
and
overcome
your
doubts
with
triumph
and
be
happy
for
the
first
time
in
your
life
and
for
the
rest
of
your
this
puts
john
in
a
state
to
be
sure
then
we
says
what
will
content
you
if
she
was
to
stand
up
for
you
when
you
was
slighted
if
she
was
to
show
herself
of
a
generous
mind
when
you
was
oppressed
if
she
was
to
be
truest
to
you
when
you
was
poorest
and
friendliest
and
all
this
against
her
own
seeming
interest
how
would
that
do
do
says
john
it
would
raise
me
to
the
then
says
my
noddy
make
your
preparations
for
the
ascent
john
it
being
my
firm
belief
that
up
you
go
bella
caught
mr
boffin
twinkling
eye
for
half
an
instant
but
he
got
it
away
from
her
and
restored
it
to
his
broad
brown
hand
the
first
you
was
always
a
special
favourite
of
noddy
said
mrs
boffin
shaking
her
head
you
were
and
if
i
had
been
inclined
to
be
jealous
i
do
know
what
i
might
have
done
to
you
but
as
i
was
why
my
beauty
with
a
hearty
laugh
and
an
embrace
made
you
a
special
favourite
of
my
own
too
but
the
horses
is
coming
round
the
corner
well
then
says
my
noddy
shaking
his
sides
till
he
was
fit
to
make
ache
again
look
out
for
being
slighted
and
oppressed
john
for
if
ever
a
man
had
a
hard
master
you
shall
find
me
from
this
present
time
to
be
such
to
and
then
he
began
cried
mrs
boffin
in
an
ecstacy
of
admiration
bless
you
then
he
began
and
how
he
did
begin
did
he
bella
looked
half
frightened
and
yet
half
laughed
bless
you
pursued
mrs
boffin
you
could
have
seen
him
of
a
night
at
that
time
of
it
the
way
he
sit
and
chuckle
over
himself
the
way
he
say
i
been
a
regular
brown
bear
and
take
himself
in
his
arms
and
hug
himself
at
the
thoughts
of
the
brute
he
had
pretended
but
every
night
he
says
to
me
better
and
better
old
lady
what
did
we
say
of
her
she
come
through
it
the
true
golden
gold
this
be
the
happiest
piece
of
work
we
ever
and
then
he
say
i
be
a
grislier
old
growler
and
laugh
he
would
till
john
and
me
was
often
forced
to
slap
his
back
and
bring
it
out
of
his
windpipes
with
a
little
water
mr
boffin
with
his
face
bent
over
his
heavy
hand
made
no
sound
but
rolled
his
shoulders
when
thus
referred
to
as
if
he
were
vastly
enjoying
himself
so
my
good
and
pretty
pursued
mrs
boffin
was
married
and
there
was
we
hid
up
in
the
by
this
husband
of
yours
for
he
would
let
us
out
with
it
then
as
was
first
meant
no
he
says
she
so
unselfish
and
contented
that
i
ca
afford
to
be
rich
yet
i
must
wait
a
little
then
when
baby
was
expected
he
says
she
is
such
a
cheerful
glorious
housewife
that
i
ca
afford
to
be
rich
yet
i
must
wait
a
little
then
when
baby
was
born
he
says
she
is
so
much
better
than
she
ever
was
that
i
ca
afford
to
be
rich
yet
i
must
wait
a
little
and
so
he
goes
on
and
on
till
i
says
outright
now
john
if
you
do
fix
a
time
for
setting
her
up
in
her
own
house
and
home
and
letting
us
walk
out
of
it
i
turn
then
he
says
he
only
wait
to
triumph
beyond
what
we
ever
thought
possible
and
to
show
her
to
us
better
than
even
we
ever
supposed
and
he
says
she
shall
see
me
under
suspicion
of
having
murdered
myself
and
you
shall
see
how
trusting
and
how
true
she
well
noddy
and
me
agreed
to
that
and
he
was
right
and
here
you
are
and
the
horses
is
in
and
the
story
is
done
and
god
bless
you
my
beauty
and
god
bless
us
all
the
pile
of
hands
dispersed
and
bella
and
mrs
boffin
took
a
good
long
hug
of
one
another
to
the
apparent
peril
of
the
inexhaustible
baby
lying
staring
in
bella
lap
is
the
story
done
said
bella
pondering
there
no
more
of
it
more
of
it
should
there
be
deary
returned
mrs
boffin
full
of
glee
you
sure
you
have
left
nothing
out
of
it
asked
bella
do
think
i
have
said
mrs
boffin
archly
dear
said
bella
a
good
nurse
will
you
please
hold
baby
having
deposited
the
inexhaustible
in
his
arms
with
those
words
bella
looked
hard
at
mr
boffin
who
had
moved
to
a
table
where
he
was
leaning
his
head
upon
his
hand
with
his
face
turned
away
and
quietly
settling
herself
on
her
knees
at
his
side
and
drawing
one
arm
over
his
shoulder
said
i
beg
your
pardon
and
i
made
a
small
mistake
of
a
word
when
i
took
leave
of
you
last
please
i
think
you
are
better
not
worse
than
hopkins
better
not
worse
than
dancer
better
not
worse
than
blackberry
jones
better
not
worse
than
any
of
them
please
something
more
cried
bella
with
an
exultant
ringing
laugh
as
she
struggled
with
him
and
forced
him
to
turn
his
delighted
face
to
hers
i
have
found
out
something
not
yet
mentioned
please
i
believe
you
are
a
miser
at
all
and
please
i
do
believe
you
ever
for
one
single
minute
were
at
this
mrs
boffin
fairly
screamed
with
rapture
and
sat
beating
her
feet
upon
the
floor
clapping
her
hands
and
bobbing
herself
backwards
and
forwards
like
a
demented
member
of
some
mandarin
family
i
understand
you
now
sir
cried
bella
want
neither
you
nor
any
one
else
to
tell
me
the
rest
of
the
story
i
can
tell
it
to
you
now
if
you
would
like
to
hear
it
you
my
dear
said
mr
boffin
it
then
cried
bella
holding
him
prisoner
by
the
coat
with
both
hands
you
saw
what
a
greedy
little
wretch
you
were
the
patron
of
you
determined
to
show
her
how
much
misused
and
misprized
riches
could
do
and
often
had
done
to
spoil
people
did
you
not
caring
what
she
thought
of
you
and
goodness
knows
that
was
of
no
consequence
you
showed
her
in
yourself
the
most
detestable
sides
of
wealth
saying
in
your
own
mind
this
shallow
creature
would
never
work
the
truth
out
of
her
own
weak
soul
if
she
had
a
hundred
years
to
do
it
in
but
a
glaring
instance
kept
before
her
may
open
even
her
eyes
and
set
her
that
was
what
you
said
to
yourself
was
it
sir
never
said
anything
of
the
sort
mr
boffin
declared
in
a
state
of
the
highest
enjoyment
you
ought
to
have
said
it
sir
returned
bella
giving
him
two
pulls
and
one
kiss
you
must
have
thought
and
meant
it
you
saw
that
good
fortune
was
turning
my
stupid
head
and
hardening
my
silly
heart
was
making
me
grasping
calculating
insolent
insufferable
and
you
took
the
pains
to
be
the
dearest
and
kindest
fingerpost
that
ever
was
set
up
anywhere
pointing
out
the
road
that
i
was
taking
and
the
end
it
led
to
confess
instantly
said
mr
boffin
one
broad
piece
of
sunshine
from
head
to
foot
wish
you
help
me
out
of
this
ca
be
heard
by
counsel
sir
returned
bella
must
speak
for
yourself
confess
instantly
my
dear
said
mr
boffin
truth
is
that
when
we
did
go
in
for
the
little
scheme
that
my
old
lady
has
pinted
out
i
did
put
it
to
john
what
did
he
think
of
going
in
for
some
such
general
scheme
as
you
have
pinted
out
but
i
did
in
any
way
so
word
it
because
i
did
in
any
way
so
mean
it
i
only
said
to
john
would
it
be
more
consistent
me
going
in
for
being
a
brown
bear
respecting
him
to
go
in
as
a
brown
bear
all
round
this
minute
sir
said
bella
you
did
it
to
correct
and
amend
me
my
dear
child
said
mr
boffin
did
do
it
to
harm
you
you
may
be
sure
of
that
and
i
did
hope
it
might
just
hint
a
caution
still
it
ought
to
be
mentioned
that
no
sooner
had
my
old
lady
found
out
john
than
john
made
known
to
her
and
me
that
he
had
had
his
eye
upon
a
thankless
person
by
the
name
of
silas
wegg
partly
for
the
punishment
of
which
wegg
by
leading
him
on
in
a
very
unhandsome
and
underhanded
game
that
he
was
playing
them
books
that
you
and
me
bought
so
many
of
together
and
my
dear
he
was
blackberry
jones
but
blewberry
was
read
aloud
to
me
by
that
person
of
the
name
of
silas
wegg
aforesaid
bella
who
was
still
on
her
knees
at
mr
boffin
feet
gradually
sank
down
into
a
sitting
posture
on
the
ground
as
she
meditated
more
and
more
thoughtfully
with
her
eyes
upon
his
beaming
face
said
bella
after
this
meditative
pause
remain
two
things
that
i
can
not
understand
mrs
boffin
never
supposed
any
part
of
the
change
in
mr
boffin
to
be
real
did
she
you
never
did
did
you
asked
bella
turning
to
her
returned
mrs
boffin
with
a
most
rotund
and
glowing
negative
yet
you
took
it
very
much
to
heart
said
bella
remember
its
making
you
very
uneasy
indeed
you
see
mrs
john
has
a
sharp
eye
john
cried
mr
boffin
shaking
his
head
with
an
admiring
air
right
my
dear
the
old
lady
nearly
blowed
us
into
shivers
and
smithers
many
times
asked
bella
did
that
happen
when
she
was
in
your
secret
it
was
a
weakness
in
the
old
lady
said
mr
boffin
yet
to
tell
you
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
i
rather
proud
of
it
my
dear
the
old
lady
thinks
so
high
of
me
that
she
could
abear
to
see
and
hear
me
coming
out
as
a
brown
one
could
abear
to
as
i
meant
it
in
consequence
of
which
we
was
everlastingly
in
danger
with
her
mrs
boffin
laughed
heartily
at
herself
but
a
certain
glistening
in
her
honest
eyes
revealed
that
she
was
by
no
means
cured
of
that
dangerous
propensity
assure
you
my
dear
said
mr
boffin
on
the
celebrated
day
when
i
made
what
has
since
been
agreed
upon
to
be
my
grandest
demonstration
i
allude
to
mew
says
the
cat
quack
quack
says
the
duck
and
says
the
dog
i
assure
you
my
dear
that
on
that
celebrated
day
them
flinty
and
unbelieving
words
hit
my
old
lady
so
hard
on
my
account
that
i
had
to
hold
her
to
prevent
her
running
out
after
you
and
defending
me
by
saying
i
was
playing
a
part
mrs
boffin
laughed
heartily
again
and
her
eyes
glistened
again
and
it
then
appeared
not
only
that
in
that
burst
of
sarcastic
eloquence
mr
boffin
was
considered
by
his
two
to
have
outdone
himself
but
that
in
his
own
opinion
it
was
a
remarkable
achievement
thought
of
it
afore
the
moment
my
dear
he
observed
to
bella
john
said
if
he
had
been
so
happy
as
to
win
your
affections
and
possess
your
heart
it
come
into
my
head
to
turn
round
upon
him
with
win
her
affections
and
possess
her
heart
mew
says
the
cat
quack
quack
says
the
duck
and
says
the
i
could
tell
you
how
it
come
into
my
head
or
where
from
but
it
had
so
much
the
sound
of
a
rasper
that
i
own
to
you
it
astonished
myself
i
was
awful
nigh
bursting
out
a
laughing
though
when
it
made
john
stare
said
my
pretty
mrs
boffin
reminded
bella
there
was
one
other
thing
you
could
understand
yes
cried
bella
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
that
i
never
shall
be
able
to
understand
as
long
as
i
live
it
is
how
john
could
love
me
so
when
i
so
little
deserved
it
and
how
you
mr
and
mrs
boffin
could
be
so
forgetful
of
yourselves
and
take
such
pains
and
trouble
to
make
me
a
little
better
and
after
all
to
help
him
to
so
unworthy
a
wife
but
i
am
very
very
grateful
it
was
john
harmon
turn
then
john
harmon
now
for
good
and
john
rokesmith
for
nevermore
to
plead
with
her
quite
unnecessarily
in
behalf
of
his
deception
and
to
tell
her
over
and
over
again
that
it
had
been
prolonged
by
her
own
winning
graces
in
her
supposed
station
of
life
this
led
on
to
many
interchanges
of
endearment
and
enjoyment
on
all
sides
in
the
midst
of
which
the
inexhaustible
being
observed
staring
in
a
most
imbecile
manner
on
mrs
boffin
breast
was
pronounced
to
be
supernaturally
intelligent
as
to
the
whole
transaction
and
was
made
to
declare
to
the
ladies
and
gemplemorums
with
a
wave
of
the
speckled
fist
with
difficulty
detached
from
an
exceedingly
short
waist
have
already
informed
my
venerable
ma
that
i
know
all
about
it
then
said
john
harmon
would
mrs
john
harmon
come
and
see
her
house
and
a
dainty
house
it
was
and
a
tastefully
beautiful
and
they
went
through
it
in
procession
the
inexhaustible
on
mrs
boffin
bosom
still
staring
occupying
the
middle
station
and
mr
boffin
bringing
up
the
rear
and
on
bella
exquisite
toilette
table
was
an
ivory
casket
and
in
the
casket
were
jewels
the
like
of
which
she
had
never
dreamed
of
and
aloft
on
an
upper
floor
was
a
nursery
garnished
as
with
rainbows
we
were
hard
put
to
it
said
john
harmon
get
it
done
in
so
short
a
time
the
house
inspected
emissaries
removed
the
inexhaustible
who
was
shortly
afterwards
heard
screaming
among
the
rainbows
whereupon
bella
withdrew
herself
from
the
presence
and
knowledge
of
gemplemorums
and
the
screaming
ceased
and
smiling
peace
associated
herself
with
that
young
olive
branch
and
look
in
noddy
said
mrs
boffin
to
mr
boffin
mr
boffin
submitting
to
be
led
on
tiptoe
to
the
nursery
door
looked
in
with
immense
satisfaction
although
there
was
nothing
to
see
but
bella
in
a
musing
state
of
happiness
seated
in
a
little
low
chair
upon
the
hearth
with
her
child
in
her
fair
young
arms
and
her
soft
eyelashes
shading
her
eyes
from
the
fire
looks
as
if
the
old
man
spirit
had
found
rest
at
last
do
it
said
mrs
boffin
old
lady
as
if
his
money
had
turned
bright
again
after
a
long
long
rust
in
the
dark
and
was
at
last
a
beginning
to
sparkle
in
the
sunlight
old
lady
it
makes
a
pretty
and
a
promising
picter
do
it
old
lady
but
aware
at
the
instant
of
a
fine
opening
for
a
point
mr
boffin
quenched
that
observation
in
this
delivered
in
the
grisliest
growling
of
the
regular
brown
bear
pretty
and
a
hopeful
picter
mew
quack
quack
and
then
trotted
silently
downstairs
with
his
shoulders
in
a
state
of
the
liveliest
commotion
chapter
checkmate
to
the
friendly
move
mr
and
mrs
john
harmon
had
so
timed
their
taking
possession
of
their
rightful
name
and
their
london
house
that
the
event
befel
on
the
very
day
when
the
last
of
the
last
mound
was
driven
out
at
the
gates
of
boffin
bower
as
it
jolted
away
mr
wegg
felt
that
the
last
load
was
correspondingly
removed
from
his
mind
and
hailed
the
auspicious
season
when
that
black
sheep
boffin
was
to
be
closely
sheared
over
the
whole
slow
process
of
levelling
the
mounds
silas
had
kept
watch
with
rapacious
eyes
but
eyes
no
less
rapacious
had
watched
the
growth
of
the
mounds
in
years
bygone
and
had
vigilantly
sifted
the
dust
of
which
they
were
composed
no
valuables
turned
up
how
should
there
be
any
seeing
that
the
old
hard
jailer
of
harmony
jail
had
coined
every
waif
and
stray
into
money
long
before
though
disappointed
by
this
bare
result
mr
wegg
felt
too
sensibly
relieved
by
the
close
of
the
labour
to
grumble
to
any
great
extent
a
of
the
dust
contractors
purchasers
of
the
mounds
had
worn
mr
wegg
down
to
skin
and
bone
this
supervisor
of
the
proceedings
asserting
his
employers
rights
to
cart
off
by
daylight
nightlight
torchlight
when
they
would
must
have
been
the
death
of
silas
if
the
work
had
lasted
much
longer
seeming
never
to
need
sleep
himself
he
would
reappear
with
a
broken
head
in
fantail
hat
and
velveteen
smalls
like
an
accursed
goblin
at
the
most
unholy
and
untimely
hours
tired
out
by
keeping
close
ward
over
a
long
day
work
in
fog
and
rain
silas
would
have
just
crawled
to
bed
and
be
dozing
when
a
horrid
shake
and
rumble
under
his
pillow
would
announce
an
approaching
train
of
carts
escorted
by
this
demon
of
unrest
to
fall
to
work
again
at
another
time
he
would
be
rumbled
up
out
of
his
soundest
sleep
in
the
dead
of
the
night
at
another
would
be
kept
at
his
post
hours
on
end
the
more
his
persecutor
besought
him
not
to
trouble
himself
to
turn
out
the
more
suspicious
was
the
crafty
wegg
that
indications
had
been
observed
of
something
hidden
somewhere
and
that
attempts
were
on
foot
to
circumvent
him
so
continually
broken
was
his
rest
through
these
means
that
he
led
the
life
of
having
wagered
to
keep
ten
thousand
in
ten
thousand
hours
and
looked
piteously
upon
himself
as
always
getting
up
and
yet
never
going
to
bed
so
gaunt
and
haggard
had
he
grown
at
last
that
his
wooden
leg
showed
disproportionate
and
presented
a
thriving
appearance
in
contrast
with
the
rest
of
his
plagued
body
which
might
almost
have
been
termed
chubby
however
wegg
comfort
was
that
all
his
disagreeables
were
now
over
and
that
he
was
immediately
coming
into
his
property
of
late
the
grindstone
did
undoubtedly
appear
to
have
been
whirling
at
his
own
nose
rather
than
boffin
but
boffin
nose
was
now
to
be
sharpened
fine
thus
far
mr
wegg
had
let
his
dusty
friend
off
lightly
having
been
baulked
in
that
amiable
design
of
frequently
dining
with
him
by
the
machinations
of
the
sleepless
dustman
he
had
been
constrained
to
depute
mr
venus
to
keep
their
dusty
friend
boffin
under
inspection
while
he
himself
turned
lank
and
lean
at
the
bower
to
mr
venus
museum
mr
wegg
repaired
when
at
length
the
mounds
were
down
and
gone
it
being
evening
he
found
that
gentleman
as
he
expected
seated
over
his
fire
but
did
not
find
him
as
he
expected
floating
his
powerful
mind
in
tea
you
smell
rather
comfortable
here
said
wegg
seeming
to
take
it
ill
and
stopping
and
sniffing
as
he
entered
am
rather
comfortable
sir
said
venus
do
use
lemon
in
your
business
do
you
asked
wegg
sniffing
again
mr
wegg
said
venus
i
use
it
at
all
i
mostly
use
it
in
cobblers
punch
do
you
call
cobblers
punch
demanded
wegg
in
a
worse
humour
than
before
difficult
to
impart
the
receipt
for
it
sir
returned
venus
however
particular
you
may
be
in
allotting
your
materials
so
much
will
still
depend
upon
the
individual
gifts
and
there
being
a
feeling
thrown
into
it
but
the
groundwork
is
gin
a
dutch
bottle
said
wegg
gloomily
as
he
sat
himself
down
good
sir
very
good
cried
venus
you
partake
sir
i
partake
returned
wegg
very
surlily
of
course
i
will
will
a
man
partake
as
has
been
tormented
out
of
his
five
senses
by
an
everlasting
dustman
with
his
head
tied
up
will
he
too
as
if
he
would
let
it
put
you
out
mr
wegg
you
do
seem
in
your
usual
spirits
you
come
to
that
you
do
seem
in
your
usual
spirits
growled
wegg
seem
to
be
setting
up
for
lively
this
circumstance
appeared
in
his
then
state
of
mind
to
give
mr
wegg
uncommon
offence
you
been
having
your
hair
cut
said
wegg
missing
the
usual
dusty
shock
mr
wegg
but
do
let
that
put
you
out
either
i
am
blest
if
you
ai
getting
fat
said
wegg
with
culminating
discontent
are
you
going
to
do
next
mr
wegg
said
venus
smiling
in
a
sprightly
manner
suspect
you
could
hardly
guess
what
i
am
going
to
do
next
do
want
to
guess
retorted
wegg
i
got
to
say
is
that
it
well
for
you
that
the
diwision
of
labour
has
been
what
it
has
been
it
well
for
you
to
have
had
so
light
a
part
in
this
business
when
mine
has
been
so
heavy
you
have
had
your
rest
broke
i
be
bound
at
all
sir
said
venus
rested
so
well
in
all
my
life
i
thank
you
grumbled
wegg
should
have
been
me
if
you
had
been
me
and
had
been
fretted
out
of
your
bed
and
your
sleep
and
your
meals
and
your
mind
for
a
stretch
of
months
together
you
have
been
out
of
condition
and
out
of
sorts
it
has
trained
you
down
mr
wegg
said
venus
contemplating
his
figure
with
an
artist
eye
you
down
very
low
it
has
so
weazen
and
yellow
is
the
kivering
upon
your
bones
that
one
might
almost
fancy
you
had
come
to
give
a
upon
the
french
gentleman
in
the
corner
instead
of
me
mr
wegg
glancing
in
great
dudgeon
towards
the
french
corner
seemed
to
notice
something
new
there
which
induced
him
to
glance
at
the
opposite
corner
and
then
to
put
on
his
glasses
and
stare
at
all
the
nooks
and
corners
of
the
dim
shop
in
succession
you
been
having
the
place
cleaned
up
he
exclaimed
mr
wegg
by
the
hand
of
adorable
woman
what
you
going
to
do
next
i
suppose
is
to
get
married
it
sir
silas
took
off
his
glasses
again
finding
himself
too
intensely
disgusted
by
the
sprightly
appearance
of
his
friend
and
partner
to
bear
a
magnified
view
of
him
and
made
the
inquiry
the
old
party
wegg
said
venus
with
a
sudden
flush
of
wrath
lady
in
question
is
not
a
old
party
meant
exclaimed
wegg
testily
the
party
as
formerly
objected
wegg
said
venus
a
case
of
so
much
delicacy
i
must
trouble
you
to
say
what
you
mean
there
are
strings
that
must
not
be
played
upon
no
sir
not
sounded
unless
in
the
most
respectful
and
tuneful
manner
of
such
melodious
strings
is
miss
pleasant
riderhood
formed
it
is
the
lady
as
formerly
objected
said
wegg
returned
venus
with
dignity
accept
the
altered
phrase
it
is
the
lady
as
formerly
objected
is
it
to
come
off
asked
silas
wegg
said
venus
with
another
flush
can
not
permit
it
to
be
put
in
the
form
of
a
fight
i
must
temperately
but
firmly
call
upon
you
sir
to
amend
that
question
is
the
lady
wegg
reluctantly
demanded
constraining
his
ill
temper
in
remembrance
of
the
partnership
and
its
stock
in
trade
going
to
give
her
where
she
has
already
given
her
returned
venus
again
accept
the
altered
phrase
and
with
pleasure
the
lady
is
a
going
to
give
her
where
she
has
already
given
her
next
monday
the
lady
objection
has
been
met
said
silas
wegg
said
venus
i
did
name
to
you
i
think
on
a
former
occasion
if
not
on
former
occasions
former
occasions
interrupted
what
pursued
venus
the
nature
of
the
lady
objection
was
i
may
impart
without
violating
any
of
the
tender
confidences
since
sprung
up
between
the
lady
and
myself
how
it
has
been
met
through
the
kind
interference
of
two
good
friends
of
mine
one
previously
acquainted
with
the
lady
and
one
not
the
pint
was
thrown
out
sir
by
those
two
friends
when
they
did
me
the
great
service
of
waiting
on
the
lady
to
try
if
a
union
betwixt
the
lady
and
me
could
not
be
brought
to
bear
the
pint
i
say
was
thrown
out
by
them
sir
whether
if
after
marriage
i
confined
myself
to
the
articulation
of
men
children
and
the
lower
animals
it
might
not
relieve
the
lady
mind
of
her
feeling
respecting
being
as
a
lady
regarded
in
a
bony
light
it
was
a
happy
thought
sir
and
it
took
root
would
seem
mr
venus
observed
wegg
with
a
touch
of
distrust
you
are
flush
of
friends
well
sir
that
gentleman
answered
in
a
tone
of
placid
mystery
sir
pretty
well
said
wegg
after
eyeing
him
with
another
touch
of
distrust
wish
you
joy
one
man
spends
his
fortune
in
one
way
and
another
in
another
you
are
going
to
try
matrimony
i
mean
to
try
travelling
mr
wegg
of
air
and
my
natural
rest
i
hope
may
bring
me
round
after
the
persecutions
i
have
undergone
from
the
dustman
with
his
head
tied
up
which
i
just
now
mentioned
the
tough
job
being
ended
and
the
mounds
laid
low
the
hour
is
come
for
boffin
to
stump
up
would
ten
morning
suit
you
partner
for
finally
bringing
boffin
nose
to
the
grindstone
ten
morning
would
quite
suit
mr
venus
for
that
excellent
purpose
have
had
him
well
under
inspection
i
hope
said
silas
mr
venus
had
had
him
under
inspection
pretty
well
every
day
you
was
just
to
step
round
then
and
give
him
orders
from
me
i
say
from
me
because
he
knows
i
wo
be
played
with
to
be
ready
with
his
papers
his
accounts
and
his
cash
at
that
time
in
the
morning
said
wegg
as
a
matter
of
form
which
will
be
agreeable
to
your
own
feelings
before
we
go
out
for
i
walk
with
you
part
of
the
way
though
my
leg
gives
under
me
with
weariness
let
have
a
look
at
the
stock
in
trade
mr
venus
produced
it
and
it
was
perfectly
correct
mr
venus
undertook
to
produce
it
again
in
the
morning
and
to
keep
tryst
with
mr
wegg
on
boffin
doorstep
as
the
clock
struck
ten
at
a
certain
point
of
the
road
between
clerkenwell
and
boffin
house
mr
wegg
expressly
insisted
that
there
should
be
no
prefix
to
the
golden
dustman
name
the
partners
separated
for
the
night
it
was
a
very
bad
night
to
which
succeeded
a
very
bad
morning
the
streets
were
so
unusually
slushy
muddy
and
miserable
in
the
morning
that
wegg
rode
to
the
scene
of
action
arguing
that
a
man
who
was
as
it
were
going
to
the
bank
to
draw
out
a
handsome
property
could
well
afford
that
trifling
expense
venus
was
punctual
and
wegg
undertook
to
knock
at
the
door
and
conduct
the
conference
door
knocked
at
door
opened
at
home
the
servant
replied
that
mr
boffin
was
at

wegg
it
ai
what
i
call
him
the
servant
inquired
if

fellow

they
were
shown
into
a
where
the
wegg
wore
his
hat
and
whistled
and
with
his
forefinger
stirred
up
a
clock
that
stood
upon
the
chimneypiece
until
he
made
it
strike
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
shown
upstairs
into
what
used
to
be
boffin
room
which
besides
the
door
of
entrance
had
in
it
to
make
it
one
of
a
suite
of
rooms
when
occasion
required
here
boffin
was
seated
at
a
and
here
mr
wegg
having
imperiously
motioned
the
servant
to
withdraw
drew
up
a
chair
and
seated
himself
in
his
hat
close
beside
him
here
also
mr
wegg
instantly
underwent
the
remarkable
experience
of
having
his
hat
twitched
off
his
head
and
thrown
out
of
a
window
which
was
opened
and
shut
for
the
purpose
careful
what
insolent
liberties
you
take
in
that
presence
said
the
owner
of
the
hand
which
had
done
this
i
will
throw
you
after
it
wegg
involuntarily
clapped
his
hand
to
his
bare
head
and
stared
at
the
secretary
for
it
was
he
addressed
him
with
a
severe
countenance
and
who
had
come
in
quietly
by
the
said
wegg
as
soon
as
he
recovered
his
suspended
power
of
speech
good
i
gave
directions
for
you
to
be
dismissed
and
you
gone
ai
you
oh

look
into
this
presently
very
good
nor

said
another
voice
somebody
else
had
come
in
quietly
by
the
turning
his
head
wegg
beheld
his
persecutor
the
dustman
accoutred
with
fantail
hat
and
velveteen
smalls
complete
who
untying
his
broken
head
revealed
a
head
that
was
whole
and
a
face
that
was
sloppy
ha
ha
gentlemen
roared
sloppy
in
a
peal
of
laughter
and
with
immeasureable
relish
never
thought
as
i
could
sleep
standing
and
often
done
it
when
i
turned
for
mrs
higden
he
never
thought
as
i
used
to
give
mrs
higden
the
in
different
voices
but
i
did
lead
him
a
life
all
through
it
gentlemen
i
hope
i
really
and
truly
did
here
mr
sloppy
opening
his
mouth
to
a
quite
alarming
extent
and
throwing
back
his
head
to
peal
again
revealed
incalculable
buttons
said
wegg
slightly
discomfited
but
not
much
as
yet
and
one
is
two
not
dismissed
is
it
bof
fin
just
let
me
ask
a
question
who
set
this
chap
on
in
this
dress
when
the
carting
began
who
employed
this
fellow
say
remonstrated
sloppy
jerking
his
head
forward
fellows
or
i
throw
you
out
of
winder
mr
boffin
appeased
him
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
and
said
employed
him
wegg
you
employed
him
boffin
very
good
mr
venus
we
raise
our
terms
and
we
ca
do
better
than
proceed
to
business
bof
fin
i
want
the
room
cleared
of
these
two
scum
not
going
to
be
done
wegg
replied
mr
boffin
sitting
composedly
on
the
at
one
end
while
the
secretary
sat
composedly
on
it
at
the
other
fin
not
going
to
be
done
repeated
wegg
at
your
peril
wegg
said
mr
boffin
shaking
his
head
at
my
peril
and
not
on
any
other
terms
wegg
reflected
a
moment
and
then
said
venus
will
you
be
so
good
as
hand
me
over
that
same
dockyment
sir
replied
venus
handing
it
to
him
with
much
politeness
it
is
having
now
sir
parted
with
it
i
wish
to
make
a
small
observation
not
so
much
because
it
is
anyways
necessary
or
expresses
any
new
doctrine
or
discovery
as
because
it
is
a
comfort
to
my
mind
silas
wegg
you
are
a
precious
old
rascal
mr
wegg
who
as
if
anticipating
a
compliment
had
been
beating
time
with
the
paper
to
the
other
politeness
until
this
unexpected
conclusion
came
upon
him
stopped
rather
abruptly
wegg
said
venus
that
i
took
the
liberty
of
taking
mr
boffin
into
our
concern
as
a
sleeping
partner
at
a
very
early
period
of
our
firm
existence
true
added
mr
boffin
i
tested
venus
by
making
him
a
pretended
proposal
or
two
and
i
found
him
on
the
whole
a
very
honest
man
wegg
mr
boffin
in
his
indulgence
is
pleased
to
say
venus
remarked
in
the
beginning
of
this
dirt
my
hands
were
not
for
a
few
hours
quite
as
clean
as
i
could
wish
but
i
hope
i
made
early
and
full
amends
you
did
said
mr
boffin
certainly
certainly
venus
inclined
his
head
with
respect
and
gratitude
you
sir
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
sir
for
all
for
your
good
opinion
now
for
your
way
of
receiving
and
encouraging
me
when
i
first
put
myself
in
communication
with
you
and
for
the
influence
since
so
kindly
brought
to
bear
upon
a
certain
lady
both
by
yourself
and
by
mr
john
harmon
to
whom
when
thus
making
mention
of
him
he
also
bowed
wegg
followed
the
name
with
sharp
ears
and
the
action
with
sharp
eyes
and
a
certain
cringing
air
was
infusing
itself
into
his
bullying
air
when
his
attention
was
by
venus
else
between
you
and
me
mr
wegg
said
venus
explains
itself
and
you
can
now
make
out
sir
without
further
words
from
me
but
totally
to
prevent
any
unpleasantness
or
mistake
that
might
arise
on
what
i
consider
an
important
point
to
be
made
quite
clear
at
the
close
of
our
acquaintance
i
beg
the
leave
of
mr
boffin
and
mr
john
harmon
to
repeat
an
observation
which
i
have
already
had
the
pleasure
of
bringing
under
your
notice
you
are
a
precious
old
rascal
are
a
fool
said
wegg
with
a
snap
of
his
fingers
i
have
got
rid
of
you
before
now
if
i
could
have
struck
out
any
way
of
doing
it
i
have
thought
it
over
i
can
tell
you
you
may
go
and
welcome
you
leave
the
more
for
me
because
you
know
said
wegg
dividing
his
next
observation
between
mr
boffin
and
mr
harmon
am
worth
my
price
and
i
mean
to
have
it
this
getting
off
is
all
very
well
in
its
way
and
it
tells
with
such
an
anatomical
pump
as
this
one
pointing
out
mr
venus
it
wo
do
with
a
man
i
am
here
to
be
bought
off
and
i
have
named
my
figure
now
buy
me
or
leave
me
leave
you
wegg
said
mr
boffin
laughing
far
as
i
am
concerned
fin
replied
wegg
turning
upon
him
with
a
severe
air
understand
your
boldness
i
see
the
brass
underneath
your
silver
plating
you
have
got
your
nose
out
of
joint
knowing
that
nothing
at
stake
you
can
afford
to
come
the
independent
game
why
you
just
so
much
smeary
glass
to
see
through
you
know
but
mr
harmon
is
in
another
sitiwation
what
mr
harmon
risks
is
quite
another
pair
of
shoes
now
i
heerd
something
lately
about
this
being
mr
harmon
i
make
out
now
some
hints
that
i
met
on
that
subject
in
the
newspaper
and
i
drop
you
bof
fin
as
beneath
my
notice
i
ask
mr
harmon
whether
he
has
any
idea
of
the
contents
of
this
present
paper
is
a
will
of
my
late
father
of
more
recent
date
than
the
will
proved
by
mr
boffin
address
whom
again
as
you
have
addressed
him
already
and
i
knock
you
down
leaving
the
whole
of
his
property
to
the
crown
said
john
harmon
with
as
much
indifference
as
was
compatible
with
extreme
sternness
you
are
cried
wegg
screwing
the
weight
of
his
body
upon
his
wooden
leg
and
screwing
his
wooden
head
very
much
on
one
side
and
screwing
up
one
eye
i
put
the
question
to
you
what
this
paper
worth
said
john
harmon
wegg
had
repeated
the
word
with
a
sneer
and
was
entering
on
some
sarcastic
retort
when
to
his
boundless
amazement
he
found
himself
gripped
by
the
cravat
shaken
until
his
teeth
chattered
shoved
back
staggering
into
a
corner
of
the
room
and
pinned
there
scoundrel
said
john
harmon
whose
seafaring
hold
was
like
that
of
a
vice
knocking
my
head
against
the
wall
urged
silas
faintly
mean
to
knock
your
head
against
the
wall
returned
john
harmon
suiting
his
action
to
his
words
with
the
heartiest
good
will
give
a
thousand
pounds
for
leave
to
knock
your
brains
out
listen
you
scoundrel
and
look
at
that
dutch
bottle
sloppy
held
it
up
for
his
edification
dutch
bottle
scoundrel
contained
the
latest
will
of
the
many
wills
made
by
my
unhappy
father
that
will
gives
everything
absolutely
to
my
noble
benefactor
and
yours
mr
boffin
excluding
and
reviling
me
and
my
sister
then
already
dead
of
a
broken
heart
by
name
that
dutch
bottle
was
found
by
my
noble
benefactor
and
yours
after
he
entered
on
possession
of
the
estate
that
dutch
bottle
distressed
him
beyond
measure
because
though
i
and
my
sister
were
both
no
more
it
cast
a
slur
upon
our
memory
which
he
knew
we
had
done
nothing
in
our
miserable
youth
to
deserve
that
dutch
bottle
therefore
he
buried
in
the
mound
belonging
to
him
and
there
it
lay
while
you
you
thankless
wretch
were
prodding
and
poking
often
very
near
it
i
dare
say
his
intention
was
that
it
should
never
see
the
light
but
he
was
afraid
to
destroy
it
lest
to
destroy
such
a
document
even
with
his
great
generous
motive
might
be
an
offence
at
law
after
the
discovery
was
made
here
who
i
was
mr
boffin
still
restless
on
the
subject
told
me
upon
certain
conditions
impossible
for
such
a
hound
as
you
to
appreciate
the
secret
of
that
dutch
bottle
i
urged
upon
him
the
necessity
of
its
being
dug
up
and
the
paper
being
legally
produced
and
established
the
first
thing
you
saw
him
do
and
the
second
thing
has
been
done
without
your
knowledge
consequently
the
paper
now
rattling
in
your
hand
as
i
shake
you
and
i
should
like
to
shake
the
life
out
of
you
is
worth
less
than
the
rotten
cork
of
the
dutch
bottle
do
you
understand
judging
from
the
fallen
countenance
of
silas
as
his
head
wagged
backwards
and
forwards
in
a
most
uncomfortable
manner
he
did
understand
scoundrel
said
john
harmon
taking
another
turn
on
his
cravat
and
holding
him
in
his
corner
at
arms
length
shall
make
two
more
short
speeches
to
you
because
i
hope
they
will
torment
you
your
discovery
was
a
genuine
discovery
such
as
it
was
for
nobody
had
thought
of
looking
into
that
place
neither
did
we
know
you
had
made
it
until
venus
spoke
to
mr
boffin
though
i
kept
you
under
good
observation
from
my
first
appearance
here
and
though
sloppy
has
long
made
it
the
chief
occupation
and
delight
of
his
life
to
attend
you
like
your
shadow
i
tell
you
this
that
you
may
know
we
knew
enough
of
you
to
persuade
mr
boffin
to
let
us
lead
you
on
deluded
to
the
last
possible
moment
in
order
that
your
disappointment
might
be
the
heaviest
possible
disappointment
that
the
first
short
speech
do
you
understand
here
john
harmon
assisted
his
comprehension
with
another
shake
scoundrel
he
pursued
am
going
to
finish
you
supposed
me
just
now
to
be
the
possessor
of
my
father
so
i
am
but
through
any
act
of
my
father
or
by
any
right
i
have
no
through
the
munificence
of
mr
boffin
the
conditions
that
he
made
with
me
before
parting
with
the
secret
of
the
dutch
bottle
were
that
i
should
take
the
fortune
and
that
he
should
take
his
mound
and
no
more
i
owe
everything
i
possess
solely
to
the
disinterestedness
uprightness
tenderness
goodness
there
are
no
words
to
satisfy
me
of
mr
and
mrs
boffin
and
when
knowing
what
i
knew
i
saw
such
a
as
you
presume
to
rise
in
this
house
against
this
noble
soul
the
wonder
is
added
john
harmon
through
his
clenched
teeth
and
with
a
very
ugly
turn
indeed
on
wegg
cravat
i
did
try
to
twist
your
head
off
and
fling
that
out
of
window
so
that
the
last
short
speech
do
you
understand
silas
released
put
his
hand
to
his
throat
cleared
it
and
looked
as
if
he
had
a
rather
large
fishbone
in
that
region
simultaneously
with
this
action
on
his
part
in
his
corner
a
singular
and
on
the
surface
an
incomprehensible
movement
was
made
by
mr
sloppy
who
began
backing
towards
mr
wegg
along
the
wall
in
the
manner
of
a
porter
or
heaver
who
is
about
to
lift
a
sack
of
flour
or
coals
am
sorry
wegg
said
mr
boffin
in
his
clemency
my
old
lady
and
i
ca
have
a
better
opinion
of
you
than
the
bad
one
we
are
forced
to
entertain
but
i
should
like
to
leave
you
after
all
said
and
done
worse
off
in
life
than
i
found
you
therefore
say
in
a
word
before
we
part
what
it
cost
to
set
you
up
in
another
stall
in
another
place
john
harmon
struck
in
do
come
outside
these
windows
boffin
returned
wegg
in
avaricious
humiliation
i
first
had
the
honour
of
making
your
acquaintance
i
had
got
together
a
collection
of
ballads
which
was
i
may
say
above
price
they
ca
be
paid
for
said
john
harmon
you
had
better
not
try
my
dear
sir
me
mr
boffin
resumed
wegg
with
a
malignant
glance
in
the
last
speaker
direction
was
putting
the
case
to
you
who
if
my
senses
did
not
deceive
me
put
the
case
to
me
i
had
a
very
choice
collection
of
ballads
and
there
was
a
new
stock
of
gingerbread
in
the
tin
box
i
say
no
more
but
would
rather
leave
it
to
you
it
difficult
to
name
what
right
said
mr
boffin
uneasily
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
i
do
want
to
go
beyond
what
right
because
you
really
have
turned
out
such
a
very
bad
fellow
so
artful
and
so
ungrateful
you
have
been
wegg
for
when
did
i
ever
injure
you
was
also
mr
wegg
went
on
in
a
meditative
manner
errand
connection
in
which
i
was
much
respected
but
i
would
not
wish
to
be
deemed
covetous
and
i
would
rather
leave
it
to
you
mr
boffin
my
word
i
do
know
what
to
put
it
at
the
golden
dustman
muttered
was
likewise
resumed
wegg
pair
of
trestles
for
which
alone
a
irish
person
who
was
deemed
a
judge
of
trestles
offered
five
and
six
a
sum
i
would
not
hear
of
for
i
should
have
lost
by
it
and
there
was
a
stool
a
umbrella
a
and
a
tray
but
i
leave
it
to
you
mr
boffin
the
golden
dustman
seeming
to
be
engaged
in
some
abstruse
calculation
mr
wegg
assisted
him
with
the
following
additional
items
was
further
miss
elizabeth
master
george
aunt
jane
and
uncle
parker
ah
when
a
man
thinks
of
the
loss
of
such
patronage
as
that
when
a
man
finds
so
fair
a
garden
rooted
up
by
pigs
he
finds
it
hard
indeed
without
going
high
to
work
it
into
money
but
i
leave
it
wholly
to
you
sir
mr
sloppy
still
continued
his
singular
and
on
the
surface
his
incomprehensible
movement
on
has
been
mentioned
said
wegg
with
a
melancholy
air
it
not
easy
to
say
how
far
the
tone
of
my
mind
may
have
been
lowered
by
unwholesome
reading
on
the
subject
of
misers
when
you
was
leading
me
and
others
on
to
think
you
one
yourself
sir
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
felt
my
tone

how
can
a

upon
his

there

likewise
a

just
now
but
i
leave
the
ole
to
you
mr
boffin
said
mr
boffin
a
couple
of
pound
justice
to
myself
i
could
take
it
sir
the
words
were
but
out
of
his
mouth
when
john
harmon
lifted
his
finger
and
sloppy
who
was
now
close
to
wegg
backed
to
wegg
back
stooped
grasped
his
coat
collar
behind
with
both
hands
and
deftly
swung
him
up
like
the
sack
of
flour
or
coals
before
mentioned
a
countenance
of
special
discontent
and
amazement
mr
wegg
exhibited
in
this
position
with
his
buttons
almost
as
prominently
on
view
as
sloppy
own
and
with
his
wooden
leg
in
a
highly
unaccommodating
state
but
not
for
many
seconds
was
his
countenance
visible
in
the
room

trotted
out
with
him
and
trotted
down
the
staircase
mr
venus
attending
to
open
the
street
door
mr
sloppy
instructions
had
been
to
deposit
his
burden
in
the
road
but
a
scavenger
cart
happening
to
stand
unattended
at
the
corner
with
its
little
ladder
planted
against
the
wheel
mr
found
it
impossible
to
resist
the
temptation
of
shooting

into
the
cart
contents

somewhat
difficult
feat
achieved
with
great
dexterity
and
with
a
prodigious
splash
chapter
what
was
caught
in
the
traps
that
were
set
how
bradley
headstone
had
been
racked
and
riven
in
his
mind
since
the
quiet
evening
when
by
the
he
had
risen
as
it
were
out
of
the
ashes
of
the
bargeman
none
but
he
could
have
told
not
even
he
could
have
told
for
such
misery
can
only
be
felt
first
he
had
to
bear
the
combined
weight
of
the
knowledge
of
what
he
had
done
of
that
haunting
reproach
that
he
might
have
done
it
so
much
better
and
of
the
dread
of
discovery
this
was
load
enough
to
crush
him
and
he
laboured
under
it
day
and
night
it
was
as
heavy
on
him
in
his
scanty
sleep
as
in
his
waking
hours
it
bore
him
down
with
a
dread
unchanging
monotony
in
which
there
was
not
a
moment
variety
the
overweighted
beast
of
burden
or
the
overweighted
slave
can
for
certain
instants
shift
the
physical
load
and
find
some
slight
respite
even
in
enforcing
additional
pain
upon
such
a
set
of
muscles
or
such
a
limb
not
even
that
poor
mockery
of
relief
could
the
wretched
man
obtain
under
the
steady
pressure
of
the
infernal
atmosphere
into
which
he
had
entered
time
went
by
and
no
visible
suspicion
dogged
him
time
went
by
and
in
such
public
accounts
of
the
attack
as
were
renewed
at
intervals
he
began
to
see
mr
lightwood
who
acted
as
lawyer
for
the
injured
man
straying
further
from
the
fact
going
wider
of
the
issue
and
evidently
slackening
in
his
zeal
by
degrees
a
glimmering
of
the
cause
of
this
began
to
break
on
bradley
sight
then
came
the
chance
meeting
with
mr
milvey
at
the
railway
station
where
he
often
lingered
in
his
leisure
hours
as
a
place
where
any
fresh
news
of
his
deed
would
be
circulated
or
any
placard
referring
to
it
would
be
posted
and
then
he
saw
in
the
light
what
he
had
brought
about
for
then
he
saw
that
through
his
desperate
attempt
to
separate
those
two
for
ever
he
had
been
made
the
means
of
uniting
them
that
he
had
dipped
his
hands
in
blood
to
mark
himself
a
miserable
fool
and
tool
that
eugene
wrayburn
for
his
wife
sake
set
him
aside
and
left
him
to
crawl
along
his
blasted
course
he
thought
of
fate
or
providence
or
be
the
directing
power
what
it
might
as
having
put
a
fraud
upon
him
overreached
him
and
in
his
impotent
mad
rage
bit
and
tore
and
had
his
fit
new
assurance
of
the
truth
came
upon
him
in
the
next
few
following
days
when
it
was
put
forth
how
the
wounded
man
had
been
married
on
his
bed
and
to
whom
and
how
though
always
in
a
dangerous
condition
he
was
a
shade
better
bradley
would
far
rather
have
been
seized
for
his
murder
than
he
would
have
read
that
passage
knowing
himself
spared
and
knowing
why
but
not
to
be
still
further
defrauded
and
overreached
which
he
would
be
if
implicated
by
riderhood
and
punished
by
the
law
for
his
abject
failure
as
though
it
had
been
a
success
he
kept
close
in
his
school
during
the
day
ventured
out
warily
at
night
and
went
no
more
to
the
railway
station
he
examined
the
advertisements
in
the
newspapers
for
any
sign
that
riderhood
acted
on
his
hinted
threat
of
so
summoning
him
to
renew
their
acquaintance
but
found
none
having
paid
him
handsomely
for
the
support
and
accommodation
he
had
had
at
the
lock
house
and
knowing
him
to
be
a
very
ignorant
man
who
could
not
write
he
began
to
doubt
whether
he
was
to
be
feared
at
all
or
whether
they
need
ever
meet
again
all
this
time
his
mind
was
never
off
the
rack
and
his
raging
sense
of
having
been
made
to
fling
himself
across
the
chasm
which
divided
those
two
and
bridge
it
over
for
their
coming
together
never
cooled
down
this
horrible
condition
brought
on
other
fits
he
could
not
have
said
how
many
or
when
but
he
saw
in
the
faces
of
his
pupils
that
they
had
seen
him
in
that
state
and
that
they
were
possessed
by
a
dread
of
his
relapsing
one
winter
day
when
a
slight
fall
of
snow
was
feathering
the
sills
and
frames
of
the
schoolroom
windows
he
stood
at
his
black
board
crayon
in
hand
about
to
commence
with
a
class
when
reading
in
the
countenances
of
those
boys
that
there
was
something
wrong
and
that
they
seemed
in
alarm
for
him
he
turned
his
eyes
to
the
door
towards
which
they
faced
he
then
saw
a
slouching
man
of
forbidding
appearance
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
school
with
a
bundle
under
his
arm
and
saw
that
it
was
riderhood
he
sat
down
on
a
stool
which
one
of
his
boys
put
for
him
and
he
had
a
passing
knowledge
that
he
was
in
danger
of
falling
and
that
his
face
was
becoming
distorted
but
the
fit
went
off
for
that
time
and
he
wiped
his
mouth
and
stood
up
again
your
pardon
governor
by
your
leave
said
riderhood
knuckling
his
forehead
with
a
chuckle
and
a
leer
place
may
this
be
is
a
school

folks
learns
wot

riderhood
gravely
nodding

governor

your
leave

there
black
board

for

riderhood

thought
it
from
the
looks
on
it
would
you
be
so
kind
as

your
name
upon
it
learned
governor
in
a
wheedling
tone
bradley
hesitated
for
a
moment
but
placed
his
usual
signature
enlarged
upon
the
board
ai
a
learned
character
myself
said
riderhood
surveying
the
class
i
do
admire

should
dearly
like
to
hear
these
here
young
folks
read
that
there

up
at
the
miserable

shrill
chorus

riderhood
a
person
of
about
your

heighth
and
breadth
and
wot
pull
down
in
a
scale
about
your
own
weight
answering
to
a
name
sounding
summat
like
totherest
with
a
desperation
in
him
that
made
him
perfectly
quiet
though
his
jaw
was
heavily
squared
with
his
eyes
upon
riderhood
and
with
traces
of
quickened
breathing
in
his
nostrils
the
schoolmaster
replied
in
a
suppressed
voice

a
pause

my

if

a
river
the
wery
bundle
under
my
arm
the
class
looked
at
the
master
as
if
appealing
from
the
irregular
entrapment
of
this
mode
of
examination
the
master
looked
at
the
examiner
as
if
he
would
have
torn
him
to
pieces
ask
your
pardon
learned
governor
said
riderhood
smearing
his
sleeve
across
his
mouth
as
he
laughed
with
a
relish
fair
to
the
lambs
i
know
it
wos
a
bit
of
fun
of
mine
but
upon
my
soul
i

the
man
who

asked
bradley

said
riderhood
they
looked
at
each
other
bradley
slowly
withdrawing
his
eyes
turned
his
face
to
the
black
board
and
slowly
wiped
his
name
out
heap
of
thanks
master
said
riderhood
bestowing
so
much
of
your
time
and
of
the
lambses
time
upon
a
man
as
has
got
no
other
recommendation
to
you
than
being
a
honest
man
wishing
to
see
at
my
lock
up
the
river
the
person
as
we
spoke
of
and
as
you
answered
for
i
takes
my
leave
of
the
lambs
and
of
their
learned
governor
both
with
those
words
he
slouched
out
of
the
school
leaving
the
master
to
get
through
his
weary
work
as
he
might
and
leaving
the
whispering
pupils
to
observe
the
master
face
until
he
fell
into
the
fit
which
had
been
long
impending
the
next
day
but
one
was
saturday
and
a
holiday
bradley
rose
early
and
set
out
on
foot
for
plashwater
weir
mill
lock
he
rose
so
early
that
it
was
not
yet
light
when
he
began
his
journey
before
extinguishing
the
candle
by
which
he
had
dressed
himself
he
made
a
little
parcel
of
his
decent
silver
watch
and
its
decent
guard
and
wrote
inside
the
paper
take
care
of
these
for
me
he
then
addressed
the
parcel
to
miss
peecher
and
left
it
on
the
most
protected
corner
of
the
little
seat
in
her
little
porch
it
was
a
cold
hard
easterly
morning
when
he
latched
the
garden
gate
and
turned
away
the
light
snowfall
which
had
feathered
his
schoolroom
windows
on
the
thursday
still
lingered
in
the
air
and
was
falling
white
while
the
wind
blew
black
the
tardy
day
did
not
appear
until
he
had
been
on
foot
two
hours
and
had
traversed
a
greater
part
of
london
from
east
to
west
such
breakfast
as
he
had
he
took
at
the
comfortless
where
he
had
parted
from
riderhood
on
the
occasion
of
their
he
took
it
standing
at
the
littered
bar
and
looked
loweringly
at
a
man
who
stood
where
riderhood
had
stood
that
early
morning
he
outwalked
the
short
day
and
was
on
the
by
the
river
somewhat
footsore
when
the
night
closed
in
still
two
or
three
miles
short
of
the
lock
he
slackened
his
pace
then
but
went
steadily
on
the
ground
was
now
covered
with
snow
though
thinly
and
there
were
floating
lumps
of
ice
in
the
more
exposed
parts
of
the
river
and
broken
sheets
of
ice
under
the
shelter
of
the
banks
he
took
heed
of
nothing
but
the
ice
the
snow
and
the
distance
until
he
saw
a
light
ahead
which
he
knew
gleamed
from
the
lock
house
window
it
arrested
his
steps
and
he
looked
all
around
the
ice
and
the
snow
and
he
and
the
one
light
had
absolute
possession
of
the
dreary
scene
in
the
distance
before
him
lay
the
place
where
he
had
struck
the
worse
than
useless
blows
that
mocked
him
with
lizzie
presence
there
as
eugene
wife
in
the
distance
behind
him
lay
the
place
where
the
children
with
pointing
arms
had
seemed
to
devote
him
to
the
demons
in
crying
out
his
name
within
there
where
the
light
was
was
the
man
who
as
to
both
distances
could
give
him
up
to
ruin
to
these
limits
had
his
world
shrunk
he
mended
his
pace
keeping
his
eyes
upon
the
light
with
a
strange
intensity
as
if
he
were
taking
aim
at
it
when
he
approached
it
so
nearly
as
that
it
parted
into
rays
they
seemed
to
fasten
themselves
to
him
and
draw
him
on
when
he
struck
the
door
with
his
hand
his
foot
followed
so
quickly
on
his
hand
that
he
was
in
the
room
before
he
was
bidden
to
enter
the
light
was
the
joint
product
of
a
fire
and
a
candle
between
the
two
with
his
feet
on
the
iron
fender
sat
riderhood
pipe
in
mouth
he
looked
up
with
a
surly
nod
when
his
visitor
came
in
his
visitor
looked
down
with
a
surly
nod
his
outer
clothing
removed
the
visitor
then
took
a
seat
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
a
smoker
i
think
said
riderhood
pushing
a
bottle
to
him
across
the
table
they
both
lapsed
into
silence
with
their
eyes
upon
the
fire
do
need
to
be
told
i
am
here
said
bradley
at
length
is
to
begin
begin
said
riderhood
i
smoked
this
here
pipe
out
he
finished
it
with
great
deliberation
knocked
out
the
ashes
on
the
hob
and
put
it
by
begin
he
then
repeated
headstone
master
if
you
wish
it
it
i
wish
to
know
what
you
want
with
me
so
you
shall
riderhood
had
looked
hard
at
his
hands
and
his
pockets
apparently
as
a
precautionary
measure
lest
he
should
have
any
weapon
about
him
but
he
now
leaned
forward
turning
the
collar
of
his
waistcoat
with
an
inquisitive
finger
and
asked
where
your
watch
have
left
it
behind

it
but
it
can
be
fetched
i
took
a
fancy
to
it
bradley
answered
with
a
contemptuous
laugh

repeated
riderhood
in
a
louder
voice
i
mean
to
have

what
you
want
of

riderhood
still
louder

of
what
i
want

riderhood
in
a
very
loud
and
furious
way

i
wo

bradley
looked
at
him
so
much
as
look
at
me
like
that
or
i
wo
talk
to
you
at
all
vociferated
riderhood
instead
of
talking
i
bring
my
hand
down
upon
you
with
all
its
weight
heavily
smiting
the
table
with
great
force
smash

on
said
bradley
after
moistening
his
lips
i
a
going
on

you
fear
but
i
go
on
enough
for
you
and
fur
enough
for
you
without
your
telling

here
bradley
headstone
master
you
might
have
split
the
governor
to
chips
and
wedges
without
my
caring
except
that
i
might
have
come
upon
you
for
a
glass
or
so
now
and
then
else
why

to
do
with

bradley
very

at

silence

riderhood
snapping
his
fingers
at
him
half
a
dozen
times

played
it
long
ago
long
afore
you
tried
your
clumsy
hand
at
it
in
days
when

begun
croaking
your
lecters

your
school

where
you
stole

how

dry
bradley
looked
at
the
fire
with
a
working
face
and
was
silent
for
a
while
at
last
he
said
with
what
seemed
an
inconsistent
composure
of
voice
and
feature
ca
get
blood
out
of
a
stone
riderhood
can
get
money
out
of
a
schoolmaster
though

a
poor
calling

had
more
than
two
guineas
from
me
already

you
know
how
long
it
has
taken
me
allowing

a
long
and
arduous
training
to
earn

a
sum

a
calling

lock
take
care
of
itself
i
take
care
of
you
once
got
you
bradley
again
looked
at
the
fire
eyeing
him
aside
riderhood
took
up
his
pipe
refilled
it
lighted
it
and
sat
smoking
bradley
leaned
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
head
upon
his
hands
and
looked
at
the
fire
with
a
most
intent
abstraction
he
said
raising
himself
in
his
chair
after
a
long
silence
and
drawing
out
his
purse
and
putting
it
on
the
table
i
part
with
this
which
is
all
the
money
i
have
say
i
let
you
have
my
watch
say
that
every
quarter
when
i
draw
my
salary
i
pay
you
a
certain
portion
of
it
nothink
of
the
sort
retorted
riderhood
shaking
his
head
as
he
smoked
got
away
once
and
i
wo
run
the
chance
agin
i
had
trouble
enough
to
find
you
and
should
have
found
you
if
i
seen
you
slipping
along
the
street
overnight
and
watched
you
till
you
was
safe
housed
i
have
one
settlement
with
you
for
good
and
all
i
am
a
man
who
has
lived
a
retired
life
i
have
no
resources
beyond
myself
i
have
absolutely
no
friends
a
lie
said
riderhood
got
one
friend
as
i
knows
of
one
as
is
good
for
a
book
or
i
a
blue
monkey
bradley
face
darkened
and
his
hand
slowly
closed
on
the
purse
and
drew
it
back
as
he
sat
listening
for
what
the
other
should
go
on
to
say
went
into
the
wrong
shop
fust
last
thursday
said
riderhood
myself
among
the
young
ladies
by
george
over
the
young
ladies
i
see
a
missis
that
missis
is
sweet
enough
upon
you
master
to
sell
herself
up
slap
to
get
you
out
of
trouble
make
her
do
it
then
bradley
stared
at
him
so
very
suddenly
that
riderhood
not
quite
knowing
how
to
take
it
affected
to
be
occupied
with
the
encircling
smoke
from
his
pipe
fanning
it
away
with
his
hand
and
blowing
it
off
spoke
to
the
mistress
did
you
inquired
bradley
with
that
former
composure
of
voice
and
feature
that
seemed
inconsistent
and
with
averted
eyes
yes
said
riderhood
withdrawing
his
attention
from
the
smoke
spoke
to
her
i
did
say
much
to
her
she
was
put
in
a
fluster
by
my
dropping
in
among
the
young
ladies
i
never
did
set
up
for
a
man
and
she
took
me
into
her
parlour
to
hope
as
there
was
nothink
wrong
i
tells
her
o
no
nothink
wrong
the
master
my
wery
good
but
i
see
how
the
land
laid
and
that
she
was
comfortable
off
bradley
put
the
purse
in
his
pocket
grasped
his
left
wrist
with
his
right
hand
and
sat
rigidly
contemplating
the
fire
could
live
more
handy
to
you
than
she
does
said
riderhood
when
i
goes
home
with
you
as
of
course
i
am
a
going
i
recommend
you
to
clean
her
out
without
loss
of
time
you
can
marry
her
arter
you
and
me
have
come
to
a
settlement
she
and
i
know
you
ca
be
keeping
company
with
no
one
else
having
been
so
lately
disapinted
in
another
quarter
not
one
other
word
did
bradley
utter
all
that
night
not
once
did
he
change
his
attitude
or
loosen
his
hold
upon
his
wrist
rigid
before
the
fire
as
if
it
were
a
charmed
flame
that
was
turning
him
old
he
sat
with
the
dark
lines
deepening
in
his
face
its
stare
becoming
more
and
more
haggard
its
surface
turning
whiter
and
whiter
as
if
it
were
being
overspread
with
ashes
and
the
very
texture
and
colour
of
his
hair
degenerating
not
until
the
late
daylight
made
the
window
transparent
did
this
decaying
statue
move
then
it
slowly
arose
and
sat
in
the
window
looking
out
riderhood
had
kept
his
chair
all
night
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
night
he
had
muttered
twice
or
thrice
that
it
was
bitter
cold
or
that
the
fire
burnt
fast
when
he
got
up
to
mend
it
but
as
he
could
elicit
from
his
companion
neither
sound
nor
movement
he
had
afterwards
held
his
peace
he
was
making
some
disorderly
preparations
for
coffee
when
bradley
came
from
the
window
and
put
on
his
outer
coat
and
hat
us
better
have
a
bit
o
breakfast
afore
we
start
said
riderhood
ai
good
to
freeze
a
empty
stomach
master
without
a
sign
to
show
that
he
heard
bradley
walked
out
of
the
lock
house
catching
up
from
the
table
a
piece
of
bread
and
taking
his
bargeman
bundle
under
his
arm
riderhood
immediately
followed
him
bradley
turned
towards
london
riderhood
caught
him
up
and
walked
at
his
side
the
two
men
trudged
on
side
by
side
in
silence
full
three
miles
suddenly
bradley
turned
to
retrace
his
course
instantly
riderhood
turned
likewise
and
they
went
back
side
by
side
bradley
the
lock
house
so
did
riderhood
bradley
sat
down
in
the
window
riderhood
warmed
himself
at
the
fire
after
an
hour
or
more
bradley
abruptly
got
up
again
and
again
went
out
but
this
time
turned
the
other
way
riderhood
was
close
after
him
caught
him
up
in
a
few
paces
and
walked
at
his
side
this
time
as
before
when
he
found
his
attendant
not
to
be
shaken
off
bradley
suddenly
turned
back
this
time
as
before
riderhood
turned
back
along
with
him
but
not
this
time
as
before
did
they
go
into
the
lock
house
for
bradley
came
to
a
stand
on
the
turf
by
the
lock
looking
up
the
river
and
down
the
river
navigation
was
impeded
by
the
frost
and
the
scene
was
a
mere
white
and
yellow
desert
come
master
urged
riderhood
at
his
side
is
a
dry
game
and
where
the
good
of
it
you
ca
get
rid
of
me
except
by
coming
to
a
settlement
i
am
a
going
along
with
you
wherever
you
go
without
a
word
of
reply
bradley
passed
quickly
from
him
over
the
wooden
bridge
on
the
lock
gates
there
even
less
sense
in
this
move
than
said
riderhood
following
weir
there
and
have
to
come
back
you
know
without
taking
the
least
notice
bradley
leaned
his
body
against
a
post
in
a
resting
attitude
and
there
rested
with
his
eyes
cast
down
brought
here
said
riderhood
gruffly
turn
it
to
some
use
by
changing
my
gates
with
a
rattle
and
a
rush
of
water
he
then
the
lock
gates
that
were
standing
open
before
opening
the
others
so
both
sets
of
gates
were
for
the
moment
closed
better
by
far
be
reasonable
bradley
headstone
master
said
riderhood
passing
him
i
drain
you
all
the
dryer
for
it
when
we
do
ah
would
you
bradley
had
caught
him
round
the
body
he
seemed
to
be
girdled
with
an
iron
ring
they
were
on
the
brink
of
the
lock
about
midway
between
the
two
sets
of
gates
go
said
riderhood
i
get
my
knife
out
and
slash
you
wherever
i
can
cut
you
let
go
bradley
was
drawing
to
the
riderhood
was
drawing
away
from
it
it
was
a
strong
grapple
and
a
fierce
struggle
arm
and
leg
bradley
got
him
round
with
his
back
to
the
lock
and
still
worked
him
backward
go
said
riderhood
what
are
you
trying
at
you
ca
drown
me
ai
i
told
you
that
the
man
as
has
come
through
drowning
can
never
be
drowned
i
ca
be
drowned
can
be
returned
bradley
in
a
desperate
clenched
voice
am
resolved
to
be
i
hold
you
living
and
i
hold
you
dead
come
down
riderhood
went
over
into
the
smooth
pit
backward
and
bradley
headstone
upon
him
when
the
two
were
found
lying
under
the
ooze
and
scum
behind
one
of
the
rotting
gates
riderhood
hold
had
relaxed
probably
in
falling
and
his
eyes
were
staring
upward
but
he
was
girdled
still
with
bradley
iron
ring
and
the
rivets
of
the
iron
ring
held
tight
chapter
persons
and
things
in
general
mr
and
mrs
john
harmon
first
delightful
occupation
was
to
set
all
matters
right
that
had
strayed
in
any
way
wrong
or
that
might
could
would
or
should
have
strayed
in
any
way
wrong
while
their
name
was
in
abeyance
in
tracing
out
affairs
for
which
john
fictitious
death
was
to
be
considered
in
any
way
responsible
they
used
a
very
broad
and
free
construction
regarding
for
instance
the
dolls
dressmaker
as
having
a
claim
on
their
protection
because
of
her
association
with
mrs
eugene
wrayburn
and
because
of
mrs
eugene
old
association
in
her
turn
with
the
dark
side
of
the
story
it
followed
that
the
old
man
riah
as
a
good
and
serviceable
friend
to
both
was
not
to
be
disclaimed
nor
even
mr
inspector
as
having
been
trepanned
into
an
industrious
hunt
on
a
false
scent
it
may
be
remarked
in
connexion
with
that
worthy
officer
that
a
rumour
shortly
afterwards
pervaded
the
force
to
the
effect
that
he
had
confided
to
miss
abbey
potterson
over
a
jug
of
mellow
flip
in
the
bar
of
the
six
jolly
fellowship
porters
that
he
stand
to
lose
a
farthing
through
mr
harmon
coming
to
life
but
was
quite
as
well
satisfied
as
if
that
gentleman
had
been
barbarously
murdered
and
he
mr
inspector
had
pocketed
the
government
reward
in
all
their
arrangements
of
such
nature
mr
and
mrs
john
harmon
derived
much
assistance
from
their
eminent
solicitor
mr
mortimer
lightwood
who
laid
about
him
professionally
with
such
unwonted
despatch
and
intention
that
a
piece
of
work
was
vigorously
pursued
as
soon
as
cut
out
whereby
young
blight
was
acted
on
as
by
that
transatlantic
dram
which
is
poetically
named
an
and
found
himself
staring
at
real
clients
instead
of
out
of
window
the
accessibility
of
riah
proving
very
useful
as
to
a
few
hints
towards
the
disentanglement
of
affairs
lightwood
applied
himself
with
infinite
zest
to
attacking
and
harassing
mr
fledgeby
who
discovering
himself
in
danger
of
being
blown
into
the
air
by
certain
explosive
transactions
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
and
having
been
sufficiently
flayed
under
his
beating
came
to
a
parley
and
asked
for
quarter
the
harmless
twemlow
profited
by
the
conditions
entered
into
though
he
little
thought
it
mr
riah
unaccountably
melted
waited
in
person
on
him
over
the
stable
yard
in
duke
street
st
james
no
longer
ravening
but
mild
to
inform
him
that
payment
of
interest
as
heretofore
but
henceforth
at
mr
offices
would
appease
his
jewish
rancour
and
departed
with
the
secret
that
mr
john
harmon
had
advanced
the
money
and
become
the
creditor
thus
was
the
sublime
snigsworth
wrath
averted
and
thus
did
he
snort
no
larger
amount
of
moral
grandeur
at
the
corinthian
column
in
the
print
over
the
fireplace
than
was
normally
in
his
and
the
british
constitution

had
been
sent
for
into
the
city
on
the
very
day
of
taking
possession
and
had
been
stunned
with
astonishment
and
and
led
about
the
house
by
one
ear
to
behold
its
various
treasures
and
had
been
enraptured
and
enchanted
pa
had
also
been
appointed
secretary
and
had
been
enjoined
to
give
instant
notice
of
resignation
to
chicksey
veneering
and
stobbles
for
ever
and
ever
but
ma
came
later
and
came
as
was
her
due
in
state
the
carriage
was
sent
for
ma
who
entered
it
with
a
bearing
worthy
of
the
occasion
accompanied
rather
than
supported
by
miss
lavinia
who
altogether
declined
to
recognize
the
maternal
majesty
mr
george
sampson
meekly
followed
he
was
received
in
the
vehicle
by
mrs
wilfer
as
if
admitted
to
the
honour
of
assisting
at
a
funeral
in
the
family
and
she
then
issued
the
order
to
the
mendicant
menial
wish
to
goodness
ma
said
lavvy
throwing
herself
back
among
the
cushions
with
her
arms
crossed
you
loll
a
little
repeated
mrs
wilfer
ma
hope
said
the
impressive
lady
am
incapable
of
it
am
sure
you
look
so
ma
but
why
one
should
go
out
to
dine
with
own
daughter
or
sister
as
if
one
was
a
blackboard
i
do
not
understand
do
i
understand
retorted
mrs
wilfer
with
deep
scorn
a
young
lady
can
mention
the
garment
in
the
name
of
which
you
have
indulged
i
blush
for
you
you
ma
said
lavvy
yawning
i
can
do
it
for
myself
i
am
obliged
to
you
when
there
any
occasion
here
mr
sampson
with
the
view
of
establishing
harmony
which
he
never
under
any
circumstances
succeeded
in
doing
said
with
an
agreeable
smile
all
you
know
we
know
it
there
and
immediately
felt
that
he
had
committed
himself
know
it
there
said
mrs
wilfer
glaring
george
remonstrated
miss
lavinia
must
say
that
i
understand
your
allusions
and
that
i
think
you
might
be
more
delicate
and
less
personal
it
cried
mr
sampson
becoming
on
the
shortest
notice
a
prey
to
despair
yes
go
it
miss
lavinia
wilfer
you
may
mean
george
sampson
by
your
expressions
i
can
not
pretend
to
imagine
neither
said
miss
lavinia
george
sampson
do
i
wish
to
imagine
it
is
enough
for
me
to
know
in
my
own
heart
that
i
am
not
going
to
having
imprudently
got
into
a
sentence
without
providing
a
way
out
of
it
miss
lavinia
was
constrained
to
close
with
to
it
a
weak
conclusion
which
however
derived
some
appearance
of
strength
from
disdain
yes
cried
mr
sampson
with
bitterness
it
ever
is
i
never
you
mean
to
say
miss
lavvy
cut
him
short
that
you
never
brought
up
a
young
gazelle
you
may
save
yourself
the
trouble
because
nobody
in
this
carriage
supposes
that
you
ever
did
we
know
you
better
as
if
this
were
a
returned
mr
sampson
in
a
dismal
vein
did
not
mean
to
say
so
what
i
did
mean
to
say
was
that
i
never
expected
to
retain
my
favoured
place
in
this
family
after
fortune
shed
her
beams
upon
it
why
do
you
take
me
said
mr
sampson
the
glittering
halls
with
which
i
can
never
compete
and
then
taunt
me
with
my
moderate
salary
is
it
generous
is
it
kind
the
stately
lady
mrs
wilfer
perceiving
her
opportunity
of
delivering
a
few
remarks
from
the
throne
here
took
up
the
altercation
sampson
she
began
can
not
permit
you
to
misrepresent
the
intentions
of
a
child
of
mine
him
alone
ma
miss
lavvy
interposed
with
haughtiness
is
indifferent
to
me
what
he
says
or
does
lavinia
quoth
mrs
wilfer
touches
the
blood
of
the
family
if
mr
george
sampson
attributes
even
to
my
youngest
daughter
do
see
why
you
should
use
the
word
even
ma
miss
lavvy
interposed
i
am
quite
as
important
as
any
of
the
others
said
mrs
wilfer
solemnly
repeat
if
mr
george
sampson
attributes
to
my
youngest
daughter
grovelling
motives
he
attributes
them
equally
to
the
mother
of
my
youngest
daughter
that
mother
repudiates
them
and
demands
of
mr
george
sampson
as
a
youth
of
honour
what
he
would
have
i
may
be
mistaken
nothing
is
more
likely
but
mr
george
sampson
proceeded
mrs
wilfer
majestically
waving
her
gloves
to
me
to
be
seated
in
a
equipage
mr
george
sampson
appears
to
me
to
be
on
his
way
by
his
own
admission
to
a
residence
that
may
be
termed
palatial
mr
george
sampson
appears
to
me
to
be
invited
to
participate
in
the
shall
i
say
the
elevation
which
has
descended
on
the
family
with
which
he
is
ambitious
shall
i
say
to
mingle
whence
then
this
tone
on
mr
sampson
part
is
only
mr
sampson
explained
in
exceedingly
low
spirits
in
a
pecuniary
sense
i
am
painfully
conscious
of
my
unworthiness
lavinia
is
now
highly
connected
can
i
hope
that
she
will
still
remain
the
same
lavinia
as
of
old
and
is
it
not
pardonable
if
i
feel
sensitive
when
i
see
a
disposition
on
her
part
to
take
me
up
short
you
are
not
satisfied
with
your
position
sir
observed
miss
lavinia
with
much
politeness
can
set
you
down
at
any
turning
you
may
please
to
indicate
to
my
sister
coachman
lavinia
urged
mr
sampson
pathetically
adore
you
if
you
ca
do
it
in
a
more
agreeable
manner
returned
the
young
lady
wish
you
would
also
pursued
mr
sampson
you
to
an
extent
which
must
ever
be
below
your
merits
i
am
well
aware
but
still
up
to
an
uncommon
mark
bear
with
a
wretch
lavinia
bear
with
a
wretch
who
feels
the
noble
sacrifices
you
make
for
him
but
is
goaded
almost
to
madness
mr
sampson
slapped
his
forehead
he
thinks
of
competing
with
the
rich
and
influential
you
have
to
compete
with
the
rich
and
influential
it
will
probably
be
mentioned
to
you
said
miss
lavvy
good
time
at
least
it
will
if
the
case
is
my
case
mr
sampson
immediately
expressed
his
fervent
opinion
that
this
was
than
human
and
was
brought
upon
his
knees
at
miss
lavinia
feet
it
was
the
crowning
addition
indispensable
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
both
mother
and
daughter
to
bear
mr
sampson
a
grateful
captive
into
the
glittering
halls
he
had
mentioned
and
to
parade
him
through
the
same
at
once
a
living
witness
of
their
glory
and
a
bright
instance
of
their
condescension
ascending
the
staircase
miss
lavinia
permitted
him
to
walk
at
her
side
with
the
air
of
saying
all
these
surroundings
i
am
yours
as
yet
george
how
long
it
may
last
is
another
question
but
i
am
yours
as
yet
she
also
benignantly
intimated
to
him
aloud
the
nature
of
the
objects
upon
which
he
looked
and
to
which
he
was
unaccustomed
as
george
aviary
george
ormolu
clock
george
and
the
like
while
through
the
whole
of
the
decorations
mrs
wilfer
led
the
way
with
the
bearing
of
a
savage
chief
who
would
feel
himself
compromised
by
manifesting
the
slightest
token
of
surprise
or
admiration
indeed
the
bearing
of
this
impressive
woman
throughout
the
day
was
a
pattern
to
all
impressive
women
under
similar
circumstances
she
renewed
the
acquaintance
of
mr
and
mrs
boffin
as
if
mr
and
mrs
boffin
had
said
of
her
what
she
had
said
of
them
and
as
if
time
alone
could
quite
wear
her
injury
out
she
regarded
every
servant
who
approached
her
as
her
sworn
enemy
expressly
intending
to
offer
her
affronts
with
the
dishes
and
to
pour
forth
outrages
on
her
moral
feelings
from
the
decanters
she
sat
erect
at
table
on
the
right
hand
of
her
as
half
suspecting
poison
in
the
viands
and
as
bearing
up
with
native
force
of
character
against
other
deadly
ambushes
her
carriage
towards
bella
was
as
a
carriage
towards
a
young
lady
of
good
position
whom
she
had
met
in
society
a
few
years
ago
even
when
slightly
thawing
under
the
influence
of
sparkling
champagne
she
related
to
her
some
passages
of
domestic
interest
concerning
her
papa
she
infused
into
the
narrative
such
arctic
suggestions
of
her
having
been
an
unappreciated
blessing
to
mankind
since
her
papa
days
and
also
of
that
gentleman
having
been
a
frosty
impersonation
of
a
frosty
race
as
struck
cold
to
the
very
soles
of
the
feet
of
the
hearers
the
inexhaustible
being
produced
staring
and
evidently
intending
a
weak
and
washy
smile
shortly
no
sooner
beheld
her
than
it
was
stricken
spasmodic
and
inconsolable
when
she
took
her
leave
at
last
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
whether
it
was
with
the
air
of
going
to
the
scaffold
herself
or
of
leaving
the
inmates
of
the
house
for
immediate
execution
yet
john
harmon
enjoyed
it
all
merrily
and
told
his
wife
when
he
and
she
were
alone
that
her
natural
ways
had
never
seemed
so
dearly
natural
as
beside
this
foil
and
that
although
he
did
not
dispute
her
being
her
father
daughter
he
should
ever
remain
stedfast
in
the
faith
that
she
could
not
be
her
mother
this
visit
was
as
has
been
said
a
grand
event
another
event
not
grand
but
deemed
in
the
house
a
special
one
occurred
at
about
the
same
period
and
this
was
the
first
interview
between
mr
sloppy
and
miss
wren
the
dolls
dressmaker
being
at
work
for
the
inexhaustible
upon
a
doll
some
two
sizes
larger
than
that
young
person
mr
sloppy
undertook
to
call
for
it
and
did
so
in
sir
said
miss
wren
who
was
working
at
her
bench
who
may
you
be
mr
sloppy
introduced
himself
by
name
and
buttons
indeed
cried
jenny
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
knowing
you
i
heard
of
your
distinguishing
yourself
you
miss
grinned
sloppy
am
sure
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
but
i
do
know
how
somebody
into
a
said
miss
wren
that
way
cried
sloppy
miss
and
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
us
exclaimed
miss
wren
with
a
start
open
your
mouth
as
wide
as
that
young
man
or
it
catch
so
and
not
shut
again
some
day
mr
sloppy
opened
it
if
possible
wider
and
kept
it
open
until
his
laugh
was
out
you
like
the
giant
said
miss
wren
he
came
home
in
the
land
of
beanstalk
and
wanted
jack
for
supper
he
miss
asked
sloppy
said
miss
wren
her
visitor
glanced
round
the
room
which
had
many
comforts
in
it
now
that
had
not
been
in
it
before
and
said
is
a
pretty
place
miss
you
think
so
sir
returned
miss
wren
what
do
you
think
of
me
the
honesty
of
mr
sloppy
being
severely
taxed
by
the
question
he
twisted
a
button
grinned
and
faltered
with
it
said
miss
wren
with
an
arch
look
you
think
me
a
queer
little
comicality
in
shaking
her
head
at
him
after
asking
the
question
she
shook
her
hair
down
cried
sloppy
in
a
burst
of
admiration
a
lot
and
what
a
colour
miss
wren
with
her
usual
expressive
hitch
went
on
with
her
work
but
left
her
hair
as
it
was
not
displeased
by
the
effect
it
had
made
do
live
here
alone
do
you
miss
asked
sloppy
said
miss
wren
with
a
chop
here
with
my
fairy
godmother
mr
sloppy
could
make
it
out
who
did
you
say
miss
replied
miss
wren
more
seriously
my
second
father
or
with
my
first
for
that
matter
and
she
shook
her
head
and
drew
a
sigh
you
had
known
a
poor
child
i
used
to
have
here
she
added
have
understood
me
but
you
did
and
you
ca
all
the
better
must
have
been
taught
a
long
time
said
sloppy
glancing
at
the
array
of
dolls
in
hand
you
came
to
work
so
neatly
miss
and
with
such
a
pretty
taste
was
taught
a
stitch
young
man
returned
the
tossing
her
head
gobbled
and
gobbled
till
i
found
out
how
to
do
it
badly
enough
at
first
but
better
now
here
have
i
said
sloppy
in
something
of
a
tone
a
learning
and
a
learning
and
here
has
mr
boffin
been
a
paying
and
a
paying
ever
so
long
have
heard
what
your
trade
is
observed
miss
wren
mr
sloppy
nodded
that
the
mounds
is
done
with
it
is
i
tell
you
what
miss
i
should
like
to
make
you
something
obliged
but
what
could
make
you
said
sloppy
surveying
the
room
could
make
you
a
handy
set
of
nests
to
lay
the
dolls
in
or
i
could
make
you
a
handy
little
set
of
drawers
to
keep
your
silks
and
threads
and
scraps
in
or
i
could
turn
you
a
rare
handle
for
that
if
it
belongs
to
him
you
call
your
father
belongs
to
me
returned
the
little
creature
with
a
quick
flush
of
her
face
and
neck
am
lame
poor
sloppy
flushed
too
for
there
was
an
instinctive
delicacy
behind
his
buttons
and
his
own
hand
had
struck
it
he
said
perhaps
the
best
thing
in
the
way
of
amends
that
could
be
said
am
very
glad
yours
because
i
rather
ornament
it
for
you
than
for
any
one
else
please
may
i
look
at
it
miss
wren
was
in
the
act
of
handing
it
to
him
over
her
bench
when
she
paused
you
had
better
see
me
use
it
she
said
sharply
is
the
way
hoppetty
kicketty
not
pretty
is
it
seems
to
me
that
you
hardly
want
it
at
all
said
sloppy
the
little
dressmaker
sat
down
again
and
gave
it
into
his
hand
saying
with
that
better
look
upon
her
and
with
a
smile
you
as
concerning
the
nests
and
the
drawers
said
sloppy
after
measuring
the
handle
on
his
sleeve
and
softly
standing
the
stick
aside
against
the
wall
it
would
be
a
real
pleasure
to
me
i
heerd
tell
that
you
can
sing
most
beautiful
and
i
should
be
better
paid
with
a
song
than
with
any
money
for
i
always
loved
the
likes
of
that
and
often
giv
mrs
higden
and
johnny
a
comic
song
myself
with
spoken
in
it
though
that
not
your
sort
i
wager
are
a
very
kind
young
man
returned
the
dressmaker
really
kind
young
man
i
accept
your
i
suppose
he
wo
mind
she
added
as
an
afterthought
shrugging
her
shoulders
if
he
does
he
may
him
that
you
call
your
father
miss
asked
sloppy
no
replied
miss
wren
him
him
him
him
repeated
sloppy
staring
about
as
if
for
him
who
is
coming
to
court
and
marry
me
returned
miss
wren
me
how
slow
you
are
him
said
sloppy
and
seemed
to
turn
thoughtful
and
a
little
troubled
never
thought
of
him
when
is
he
coming
miss
a
question
cried
miss
wren
should
i
know
is
he
coming
from
miss
good
gracious
how
can
i
tell
he
is
coming
from
somewhere
or
other
i
suppose
and
he
is
coming
some
day
or
other
i
suppose
i
know
any
more
about
him
at
present
this
tickled
mr
sloppy
as
an
extraordinarily
good
joke
and
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
with
measureless
enjoyment
at
the
sight
of
him
laughing
in
that
absurd
way
the
dolls
dressmaker
laughed
very
heartily
indeed
so
they
both
laughed
till
they
were
tired
there
there
said
miss
wren
goodness
sake
stop
giant
or
i
shall
be
swallowed
up
alive
before
i
know
it
and
to
this
minute
you
have
said
what
you
come
for
have
come
for
little
miss
harmonses
doll
said
sloppy
thought
as
much
remarked
miss
wren
here
is
little
miss
harmonses
doll
waiting
for
you
she
folded
up
in
silver
paper
you
see
as
if
she
was
wrapped
from
head
to
foot
in
new
bank
notes
take
care
of
her
and
there
my
hand
and
thank
you
again
take
more
care
of
her
than
if
she
was
a
gold
image
said
sloppy
there
both
my
hands
miss
and
i
soon
come
back
again
but
the
greatest
event
of
all
in
the
new
life
of
mr
and
mrs
john
harmon
was
a
visit
from
mr
and
mrs
eugene
wrayburn
sadly
wan
and
worn
was
the
once
gallant
eugene
and
walked
resting
on
his
wife
arm
and
leaning
heavily
upon
a
stick
but
he
was
daily
growing
stronger
and
better
and
it
was
declared
by
the
medical
attendants
that
he
might
not
be
much
disfigured
it
was
a
grand
event
indeed
when
mr
and
mrs
eugene
wrayburn
came
to
stay
at
mr
and
mrs
john
harmon
house
where
by
the
way
mr
and
mrs
boffin
exquisitely
happy
and
daily
cruising
about
to
look
at
shops
were
likewise
staying
indefinitely
to
mr
eugene
wrayburn
in
confidence
did
mrs
john
harmon
impart
what
she
had
known
of
the
state
of
his
wife
affections
in
his
reckless
time
and
to
mrs
john
harmon
in
confidence
did
mr
eugene
wrayburn
impart
that
please
god
she
should
see
how
his
wife
had
changed
him
make
no
protestations
said
eugene
who
does
who
means
them
i
have
made
a
resolution
would
you
believe
bella
interposed
his
wife
coming
to
resume
her
nurse
place
at
his
side
for
he
never
got
on
well
without
her
on
our
wedding
day
he
told
me
he
almost
thought
the
best
thing
he
could
do
was
to
die
i
did
do
it
lizzie
said
eugene
do
that
better
thing
you
suggested
for
your
sake
that
same
afternoon
eugene
lying
on
his
couch
in
his
own
room
upstairs
lightwood
came
to
chat
with
him
while
bella
took
his
wife
out
for
a
ride
short
of
force
will
make
her
go
eugene
had
said
so
bella
had
playfully
forced
her
old
fellow
eugene
began
with
lightwood
reaching
up
his
hand
could
have
come
at
a
better
time
for
my
mind
is
full
and
i
want
to
empty
it
first
of
my
present
before
i
touch
upon
my
future
who
is
a
much
younger
cavalier
than
i
and
a
professed
admirer
of
beauty
was
so
affable
as
to
remark
the
other
day
he
paid
us
a
visit
of
two
days
up
the
river
there
and
much
objected
to
the
accommodation
of
the
hotel
that
lizzie
ought
to
have
her
portrait
painted
which
coming
from
may
be
considered
equivalent
to
a
melodramatic
blessing
are
getting
well
said
mortimer
with
a
smile
said
eugene
mean
it
when
said
that
and
followed
it
up
by
rolling
the
claret
for
which
he
called
and
i
paid
in
his
mouth
and
saying
my
dear
son
why
do
you
drink
this
trash
it
was
tantamount
in
him
to
a
paternal
benediction
on
our
union
accompanied
with
a
gush
of
tears
the
coolness
of
is
not
to
be
measured
by
ordinary
standards
enough
said
lightwood
all
pursued
eugene
i
shall
ever
hear
from
on
the
subject
and
he
will
continue
to
saunter
through
the
world
with
his
hat
on
one
side
my
marriage
being
thus
solemnly
recognized
at
the
family
altar
i
have
no
further
trouble
on
that
score
next
you
really
have
done
wonders
for
me
mortimer
in
easing
my
and
with
such
a
guardian
and
steward
beside
me
as
the
preserver
of
my
life
i
am
hardly
strong
yet
you
see
for
i
am
not
man
enough
to
refer
to
her
without
a
trembling
voice
she
is
so
inexpressibly
dear
to
me
mortimer
the
little
that
i
can
call
my
own
will
be
more
than
it
ever
has
been
it
need
be
more
for
you
know
what
it
always
has
been
in
my
hands
nothing
than
nothing
i
fancy
eugene
my
own
small
income
i
devoutly
wish
that
my
grandfather
had
left
it
to
the
ocean
rather
than
to
me
has
been
an
effective
something
in
the
way
of
preventing
me
from
turning
to
at
anything
and
i
think
yours
has
been
much
the
same
spake
the
voice
of
wisdom
said
eugene
are
shepherds
both
in
turning
to
at
last
we
turn
to
in
earnest
let
us
say
no
more
of
that
for
a
few
years
to
come
now
i
have
had
an
idea
mortimer
of
taking
myself
and
my
wife
to
one
of
the
colonies
and
working
at
my
vocation
there
should
be
lost
without
you
eugene
but
you
may
be
right
said
eugene
emphatically
right
wrong
he
said
it
with
such
a
lively
almost
angry
flash
that
mortimer
showed
himself
greatly
surprised
think
this
thumped
head
of
mine
is
excited
eugene
went
on
with
a
high
look
so
believe
me
i
can
say
to
you
of
the
healthful
music
of
my
pulse
what
hamlet
said
of
his
my
blood
is
up
but
wholesomely
up
when
i
think
of
it
tell
me
shall
i
turn
coward
to
lizzie
and
sneak
away
with
her
as
if
i
were
ashamed
of
her
where
would
your
part
in
this
world
be
mortimer
if
she
had
turned
coward
to
him
and
on
immeasurably
better
occasion
and
stanch
said
lightwood
yet
eugene
yet
what
mortimer
yet
are
you
sure
that
you
might
not
feel
for
her
sake
i
say
for
her
sake
any
slight
coldness
towards
her
on
the
part
of
society
you
and
i
may
well
stumble
at
the
word
returned
eugene
laughing
we
mean
our
tippins
we
do
said
mortimer
laughing
also
we
do
returned
eugene
with
great
animation
may
hide
behind
the
bush
and
beat
about
it
but
we
do
now
my
wife
is
something
nearer
to
my
heart
mortimer
than
tippins
is
and
i
owe
her
a
little
more
than
i
owe
to
tippins
and
i
am
rather
prouder
of
her
than
i
ever
was
of
tippins
therefore
i
will
fight
it
out
to
the
last
gasp
with
her
and
for
her
here
in
the
open
field
when
i
hide
her
or
strike
for
her
in
a
hole
or
a
corner
do
you
whom
i
love
next
best
upon
earth
tell
me
what
i
shall
most
righteously
deserve
to
be
told
that
she
would
have
done
well
to
turn
me
over
with
her
foot
that
night
when
i
lay
bleeding
to
death
and
spat
in
my
dastard
face
the
glow
that
shone
upon
him
as
he
spoke
the
words
so
irradiated
his
features
that
he
looked
for
the
time
as
though
he
had
never
been
mutilated
his
friend
responded
as
eugene
would
have
had
him
respond
and
they
discoursed
of
the
future
until
lizzie
came
back
after
resuming
her
place
at
his
side
and
tenderly
touching
his
hands
and
his
head
she
said
dear
you
made
me
go
out
but
i
ought
to
have
stayed
with
you
you
are
more
flushed
than
you
have
been
for
many
days
what
have
you
been
doing
replied
eugene
looking
forward
to
your
coming
back
talking
to
mr
lightwood
said
lizzie
turning
to
him
with
a
smile
it
can
not
have
been
society
that
disturbed
you
my
dear
love
retorted
eugene
in
his
old
airy
manner
as
he
laughed
and
kissed
her
rather
think
it
was
society
though
the
word
ran
so
much
in
mortimer
lightwood
thoughts
as
he
went
home
to
the
temple
that
night
that
he
resolved
to
take
a
look
at
society
which
he
had
not
seen
for
a
considerable
period
chapter
the
voice
of
society
behoves
mortimer
lightwood
therefore
to
answer
a
dinner
card
from
mr
and
mrs
veneering
requesting
the
honour
and
to
signify
that
mr
mortimer
lightwood
will
be
happy
to
have
the
other
honour
the
veneerings
have
been
as
usual
indefatigably
dealing
dinner
cards
to
society
and
whoever
desires
to
take
a
hand
had
best
be
quick
about
it
for
it
is
written
in
the
books
of
the
insolvent
fates
that
veneering
shall
make
a
resounding
smash
next
week
yes
having
found
out
the
clue
to
that
great
mystery
how
people
can
contrive
to
live
beyond
their
means
and
having
his
jobberies
as
legislator
deputed
to
the
universe
by
the
pure
electors
of
it
shall
come
to
pass
next
week
that
veneering
will
accept
the
chiltern
hundreds
that
the
legal
gentleman
in
britannia
confidence
will
again
accept
the
thousands
and
that
the
veneerings
will
retire
to
calais
there
to
live
on
mrs
veneering
diamonds
in
which
mr
veneering
as
a
good
husband
has
from
time
to
time
invested
considerable
sums
and
to
relate
to
neptune
and
others
how
that
before
veneering
retired
from
parliament
the
house
of
commons
was
composed
of
himself
and
the
six
hundred
and
dearest
and
oldest
friends
he
had
in
the
world
it
shall
likewise
come
to
pass
at
as
nearly
as
possible
the
same
period
that
society
will
discover
that
it
always
did
despise
veneering
and
distrust
veneering
and
that
when
it
went
to
veneering
to
dinner
it
always
had
misgivings
though
very
secretly
at
the
time
it
would
seem
and
in
a
perfectly
private
and
confidential
manner
the
next
week
books
of
the
insolvent
fates
however
being
not
yet
opened
there
is
the
usual
rush
to
the
veneerings
of
the
people
who
go
to
their
house
to
dine
with
one
another
and
not
with
them
there
is
lady
tippins
there
are
podsnap
the
great
and
mrs
podsnap
there
is
twemlow
there
are
buffer
boots
and
brewer
there
is
the
contractor
who
is
providence
to
five
hundred
thousand
men
there
is
the
chairman
travelling
three
thousand
miles
per
week
there
is
the
brilliant
genius
who
turned
the
shares
into
that
remarkably
exact
sum
of
three
hundred
and
seventy
five
thousand
pounds
no
shillings
and
nopence
to
whom
add
mortimer
lightwood
coming
in
among
them
with
a
reassumption
of
his
old
languid
air
founded
on
eugene
and
belonging
to
the
days
when
he
told
the
story
of
the
man
from
somewhere
that
fresh
fairy
tippins
all
but
screams
at
sight
of
her
false
swain
she
summons
the
deserter
to
her
with
her
fan
but
the
deserter
predetermined
not
to
come
talks
britain
with
podsnap
podsnap
always
talks
britain
and
talks
as
if
he
were
a
sort
of
private
watchman
employed
in
the
british
interests
against
the
rest
of
the
world
know
what
russia
means
sir
says
podsnap
know
what
france
wants
we
see
what
america
is
up
to
but
we
know
what
england
is
that
enough
for
us
however
when
dinner
is
served
and
lightwood
drops
into
his
old
place
over
against
lady
tippins
she
can
be
fended
off
no
longer
banished
robinson
crusoe
says
the
charmer
exchanging
salutations
did
you
leave
the
island
you
says
lightwood
made
no
complaint
of
being
in
pain
anywhere
how
did
you
leave
the
savages
asks
lady
tippins
were
becoming
civilized
when
i
left
juan
fernandez
says
lightwood
least
they
were
eating
one
another
which
looked
like
it
returns
the
dear
young
creature
know
what
i
mean
and
you
trifle
with
my
impatience
tell
me
something
immediately
about
the
married
pair
you
were
at
the
wedding
i
mortimer
pretends
at
great
leisure
to
consider
i
was
was
the
bride
dressed
in
rowing
costume
mortimer
looks
gloomy
and
declines
to
answer
hope
she
steered
herself
skiffed
herself
paddled
herself
larboarded
and
starboarded
herself
or
whatever
the
technical
term
may
be
to
the
ceremony
proceeds
the
playful
tippins
she
got
to
it
she
graced
it
says
mortimer
lady
tippins
with
a
skittish
little
scream
attracts
the
general
attention
it
take
care
of
me
if
i
faint
veneering
he
means
to
tell
us
that
a
horrid
female
waterman
is
graceful
me
i
mean
to
tell
you
nothing
lady
tippins
replies
lightwood
and
keeps
his
word
by
eating
his
dinner
with
a
show
of
the
utmost
indifference
shall
not
escape
me
in
this
way
you
morose
backwoodsman
retorts
lady
tippins
shall
not
evade
the
question
to
screen
your
friend
eugene
who
has
made
this
exhibition
of
himself
the
knowledge
shall
be
brought
home
to
you
that
such
a
ridiculous
affair
is
condemned
by
the
voice
of
society
my
dear
mrs
veneering
do
let
us
resolve
ourselves
into
a
committee
of
the
whole
house
on
the
subject
mrs
veneering
always
charmed
by
this
rattling
sylph
cries
yes
do
let
us
resolve
ourselves
into
a
committee
of
the
whole
house
so
delicious
veneering
says
many
as
are
of
that
opinion
say
aye
contrary
no
the
ayes
have
it
but
nobody
takes
the
slightest
notice
of
his
joke
i
am
chairwoman
of
committees
cries
lady
tippins
spirits
she
has
exclaims
mrs
veneering
to
whom
likewise
nobody
attends
this
pursues
the
sprightly
one
a
committee
of
the
whole
house
to
elicit
i
suppose
the
voice
of
society
the
question
before
the
committee
is
whether
a
young
man
of
very
fair
family
good
appearance
and
some
talent
makes
a
fool
or
a
wise
man
of
himself
in
marrying
a
female
waterman
turned
factory
girl
so
i
think
the
stubborn
mortimer
strikes
in
take
the
question
to
be
whether
such
a
man
as
you
describe
lady
tippins
does
right
or
wrong
in
marrying
a
brave
woman
i
say
nothing
of
her
beauty
who
has
saved
his
life
with
a
wonderful
energy
and
address
whom
he
knows
to
be
virtuous
and
possessed
of
remarkable
qualities
whom
he
has
long
admired
and
who
is
deeply
attached
to
him
excuse
me
says
podsnap
with
his
temper
and
his
about
equally
rumpled
this
young
woman
ever
a
female
waterman
but
she
sometimes
rowed
in
a
boat
with
her
father
i
believe
general
sensation
against
the
young
woman
brewer
shakes
his
head
boots
shakes
his
head
buffer
shakes
his
head
now
mr
lightwood
was
she
ever
pursues
podsnap
with
his
indignation
rising
high
into
those
of
his
factory
girl
but
she
had
some
employment
in
a
paper
mill
i
believe
general
sensation
repeated
brewer
says
dear
boots
says
dear
buffer
says
dear
all
in
a
rumbling
tone
of
protest
all
i
have
to
say
is
returns
podsnap
putting
the
thing
away
with
his
right
arm
my
gorge
rises
against
such
a
marriage
that
it
offends
and
disgusts
me
that
it
makes
me
sick
and
that
i
desire
to
know
no
more
about
it
i
wonder
thinks
mortimer
amused
you
are
the
voice
of
society
hear
hear
cries
lady
tippins
opinion
of
this
mesalliance
honourable
colleagues
of
the
honourable
member
who
has
just
sat
down
mrs
podsnap
is
of
opinion
that
in
these
matters
there
should
be
an
equality
of
station
and
fortune
and
that
a
man
accustomed
to
society
should
look
out
for
a
woman
accustomed
to
society
and
capable
of
bearing
her
part
in
it
with
an
ease
and
elegance
of
carriage
that
mrs
podsnap
stops
there
delicately
intimating
that
every
such
man
should
look
out
for
a
fine
woman
as
nearly
resembling
herself
as
he
may
hope
to
discover
i
wonder
thinks
mortimer
you
are
the
voice
lady
tippins
next
canvasses
the
contractor
of
five
hundred
thousand
power
it
appears
to
this
potentate
that
what
the
man
in
question
should
have
done
would
have
been
to
buy
the
young
woman
a
boat
and
a
small
annuity
and
set
her
up
for
herself
these
things
are
a
question
of
beefsteaks
and
porter
you
buy
the
young
woman
a
boat
very
good
you
buy
her
at
the
same
time
a
small
annuity
you
speak
of
that
annuity
in
pounds
sterling
but
it
is
in
reality
so
many
pounds
of
beefsteaks
and
so
many
pints
of
porter
on
the
one
hand
the
young
woman
has
the
boat
on
the
other
hand
she
consumes
so
many
pounds
of
beefsteaks
and
so
many
pints
of
porter
those
beefsteaks
and
that
porter
are
the
fuel
to
that
young
woman
engine
she
derives
therefrom
a
certain
amount
of
power
to
row
the
boat
that
power
will
produce
so
much
money
you
add
that
to
the
small
annuity
and
thus
you
get
at
the
young
woman
income
that
it
seems
to
the
contractor
is
the
way
of
looking
at
it
the
fair
enslaver
having
fallen
into
one
of
her
gentle
sleeps
during
the
last
exposition
nobody
likes
to
wake
her
fortunately
she
comes
awake
of
herself
and
puts
the
question
to
the
wandering
chairman
the
wanderer
can
only
speak
of
the
case
as
if
it
were
his
own
if
such
a
young
woman
as
the
young
woman
described
had
saved
his
own
life
he
would
have
been
very
much
obliged
to
her
would
have
married
her
and
would
have
got
her
a

the
suffrages
of

nobody
dreaming
of

for

looking
round

through

mr

good
gracious
my

forgotten
my
dearest
my

what
is
his

twemlow
has
the
air
of
being
ill
at
ease
as
he
takes
his
hand
from
his

and
replies
am
disposed
to

says

this
is
a
question
of
the
feelings
of
a
gentleman
gentleman
can
have
no
feelings
who
contracts
such
a
marriage
flushes
podsnap
me
sir
says
twemlow
rather
less
mildly
than
usual
agree
with
you
if
this
gentleman
feelings
of
gratitude
of
respect
of
admiration
and
affection
induced
him
as
i
presume
they
did
to
marry
this
lady
lady
echoes
podsnap
returns
twemlow
with
his
wristbands
bristling
a
little
repeat
the
word
i
repeat
the
word
this
lady
what
else
would
you
call
her
if
the
gentleman
were
present
this
being
something
in
the
nature
of
a
poser
for
podsnap
he
merely
waves
it
away
with
a
speechless
wave
say
resumes
twemlow
such
feelings
on
the
part
of
this
gentleman
induced
this
gentleman
to
marry
this
lady
i
think
he
is
the
greater
gentleman
for
the
action
and
makes
her
the
greater
lady
i
beg
to
say
that
when
i
use
the
word
gentleman
i
use
it
in
the
sense
in
which
the
degree
may
be
attained
by
any
man
the
feelings
of
a
gentleman
i
hold
sacred
and
i
confess
i
am
not
comfortable
when
they
are
made
the
subject
of
sport
or
general
discussion
should
like
to
know
sneers
podsnap
your
noble
relation
would
be
of
your
opinion
podsnap
retorts
twemlow
me
he
might
be
or
he
might
not
be
i
can
not
say
but
i
could
not
allow
even
him
to
dictate
to
me
on
a
point
of
great
delicacy
on
which
i
feel
very
strongly
somehow
a
canopy
of
wet
blanket
seems
to
descend
upon
the
company
and
lady
tippins
was
never
known
to
turn
so
very
greedy
or
so
very
cross
mortimer
lightwood
alone
brightens
he
has
been
asking
himself
as
to
every
other
member
of
the
committee
in
turn
wonder
whether
you
are
the
voice
but
he
does
not
ask
himself
the
question
after
twemlow
has
spoken
and
he
glances
in
twemlow
direction
as
if
he
were
grateful
when
the
company
disperse
by
which
time
mr
and
mrs
veneering
have
had
quite
as
much
as
they
want
of
the
honour
and
the
guests
have
had
quite
as
much
as
they
want
of
the
other
honour

gaily
postscript
in
lieu
of
preface
when
i
devised
this
story
i
foresaw
the
likelihood
that
a
class
of
readers
and
commentators
would
suppose
that
i
was
at
great
pains
to
conceal
exactly
what
i
was
at
great
pains
to
suggest
namely
that
mr
john
harmon
was
not
slain
and
that
mr
john
rokesmith
was
he
pleasing
myself
with
the
idea
that
the
supposition
might
in
part
arise
out
of
some
ingenuity
in
the
story
and
thinking
it
worth
while
in
the
interests
of
art
to
hint
to
an
audience
that
an
artist
of
whatever
denomination
may
perhaps
be
trusted
to
know
what
he
is
about
in
his
vocation
if
they
will
concede
him
a
little
patience
i
was
not
alarmed
by
the
anticipation
to
keep
for
a
long
time
unsuspected
yet
always
working
itself
out
another
purpose
originating
in
that
leading
incident
and
turning
it
to
a
pleasant
and
useful
account
at
last
was
at
once
the
most
interesting
and
the
most
difficult
part
of
my
design
its
difficulty
was
much
enhanced
by
the
mode
of
publication
for
it
would
be
very
unreasonable
to
expect
that
many
readers
pursuing
a
story
in
portions
from
month
to
month
through
nineteen
months
will
until
they
have
it
before
them
complete
perceive
the
relations
of
its
finer
threads
to
the
whole
pattern
which
is
always
before
the
eyes
of
the
at
his
loom
yet
that
i
hold
the
advantages
of
the
mode
of
publication
to
outweigh
its
disadvantages
may
be
easily
believed
of
one
who
revived
it
in
the
pickwick
papers
after
long
disuse
and
has
pursued
it
ever
since
there
is
sometimes
an
odd
disposition
in
this
country
to
dispute
as
improbable
in
fiction
what
are
the
commonest
experiences
in
fact
therefore
i
note
here
though
it
may
not
be
at
all
necessary
that
there
are
hundreds
of
will
cases
as
they
are
called
far
more
remarkable
than
that
fancied
in
this
book
and
that
the
stores
of
the
prerogative
office
teem
with
instances
of
testators
who
have
made
changed
contradicted
hidden
forgotten
left
cancelled
and
left
uncancelled
each
many
more
wills
than
were
ever
made
by
the
elder
mr
harmon
of
harmony
jail
in
my
social
experiences
since
mrs
betty
higden
came
upon
the
scene
and
left
it
i
have
found
circumlocutional
champions
disposed
to
be
warm
with
me
on
the
subject
of
my
view
of
the
poor
law
mr
friend
mr
bounderby
could
never
see
any
difference
between
leaving
the
coketown
exactly
as
they
were
and
requiring
them
to
be
fed
with
turtle
soup
and
venison
out
of
gold
spoons
idiotic
propositions
of
a
parallel
nature
have
been
freely
offered
for
my
acceptance
and
i
have
been
called
upon
to
admit
that
i
would
give
poor
law
relief
to
anybody
anywhere
anyhow
putting
this
nonsense
aside
i
have
observed
a
suspicious
tendency
in
the
champions
to
divide
into
two
parties
the
one
contending
that
there
are
no
deserving
poor
who
prefer
death
by
slow
starvation
and
bitter
weather
to
the
mercies
of
some
relieving
officers
and
some
union
houses
the
other
admitting
that
there
are
such
poor
but
denying
that
they
have
any
cause
or
reason
for
what
they
do
the
records
in
our
newspapers
the
late
exposure
by
the
lancet
and
the
common
sense
and
senses
of
common
people
furnish
too
abundant
evidence
against
both
defences
but
that
my
view
of
the
poor
law
may
not
be
mistaken
or
misrepresented
i
will
state
it
i
believe
there
has
been
in
england
since
the
days
of
the
stuarts
no
law
so
often
infamously
administered
no
law
so
often
openly
violated
no
law
habitually
so
in
the
majority
of
the
shameful
cases
of
disease
and
death
from
destitution
that
shock
the
public
and
disgrace
the
country
the
illegality
is
quite
equal
to
the
inhumanity
and
known
language
could
say
no
more
of
their
lawlessness
on
friday
the
ninth
of
june
in
the
present
year
mr
and
mrs
boffin
in
their
manuscript
dress
of
receiving
mr
and
mrs
lammle
at
breakfast
were
on
the
south
eastern
railway
with
me
in
a
terribly
destructive
accident
when
i
had
done
what
i
could
to
help
others
i
climbed
back
into
my
carriage
nearly
turned
over
a
viaduct
and
caught
aslant
upon
the
turn
to
extricate
the
worthy
couple
they
were
much
soiled
but
otherwise
unhurt
the
same
happy
result
attended
miss
bella
wilfer
on
her
wedding
day
and
mr
riderhood
inspecting
bradley
headstone
red
neckerchief
as
he
lay
asleep
i
remember
with
devout
thankfulness
that
i
can
never
be
much
nearer
parting
company
with
my
readers
for
ever
than
i
was
then
until
there
shall
be
written
against
my
life
the
two
words
with
which
i
have
this
day
closed
this
book
