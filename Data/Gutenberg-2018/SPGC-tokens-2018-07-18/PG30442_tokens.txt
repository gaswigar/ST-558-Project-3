flourmill
located
in
the
rhône
valley
in
the
heart
of
provence
on
a
wooded
hillside
of
pines
and
green
oaks
being
the
said
windmill
abandoned
for
over
twenty
years
and
not
viable
for
grinding
as
it
appears
that
wild
vines
moss
rosemary
and
other
parasitic
greenery
are
climbing
up
to
the
sails
notwithstanding
the
condition
it
is
in
and
performs
with
its
grinding
wheel
broken
its
platform
brickwork
grown
through

to

this

put

deposed
as
a
type
of

all
the
foregoing
having
been

and
the

made
at

in

in
the
presence
of
francet
mamaï
fife
player
and
of
louiset
known
as
quique
crucifix
carrier
for
the
white
penitents
who
have
signed
together
with
the
parties
above
and
the
lawyer
after
reading
it
letters
from
my
windmill
first
impressions
i
am
not
sure
who
was
the
more
surprised
when
i
arrived
me
or
the
rabbits
the
door
had
been
bolted
and
barred
for
a
long
time
and
the
walls
and
platform
were
overgrown
with
weeds
so
understandably
the
rabbits
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
millers
were
a
dying
breed
they
had
found
the
place
much
to
their
liking
and
felt
fully
entitled
to
made
the
windmill
their
general
and
strategic
headquarters
the
night
i
moved
in
i
tell
you
there
were
over
twenty
of
them
sprawled
around
the
apron
basking
in
the
moonlight
when
i
opened
a
window
the
whole
encampment
scampered
off
their
white
scuts
bobbing
up
and
down
until
they
had
completely
disappeared
into
the
brush
i
do
hope
they
come
back
though
another
much
surprised
resident
was
also
not
best
comforted
by
my
arrival
it
was
the
old
thoughtful
owl
a
sitting
tenant
for
some
twenty
years
i
found
him
stiff
and
motionless
on
his
roost
of
fallen
plaster
and
tiles
he
ran
his
large
round
eyes
over
me
briefly
and
then
probably
much
put
out
by
the
presence
of
a
stranger
he
hooted
and
painfully
and
carefully
shook
his
dusty
grey
wings
they
ponder
too
much
these
owlish
thinking
types
and
never
keep
themselves
clean
it
did
matter
even
with
his
blinking
eyes
and
his
sullen
expression
this
particular
occupant
would
suit
me
better
than
most
and
i
immediately
decided
he
was
only
too
welcome
to
stay
he
stayed
right
there
just
where
he
always
been
at
the
very
top
of
the
mill
near
his
own
personal
roof
entrance
me
i
settled
down
below
in
a
little
whitewashed
vaulted
and
room
much
like
a
nun
refectory
i
am
writing
to
you
from
my
windmill
with
the
door
wide
open
to
the
brilliant
sunshine
in
front
of
me
a
lovely
sparklingly
lit
pine
wood
plunges
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
the
nearest
mountains
the
alpilles
are
far
away
their
grand
silhouettes
pressing
against
the
sky
there
was
hardly
a
sound
to
be
heard
a
fading
fife
a
curlew
calling
amongst
the
lavender
and
a
tinkle
of
mules
bells
from
somewhere
along
the
track
the
provencal
light
really
brings
this
beautiful
landscape
to
life
do
you
wonder
right
now
if
i
am
missing
your
black
and
bustling
paris
actually
i
very
contented
in
my
windmill
it
is
just
the
sort
of
warm
spot
i
was
looking
for
a
long
long
way
from
newspapers
hansom
cabs
and
all
that
fog
also
i
am
surrounded
by
so
many
lovely
things
my
head
is
bursting
with
vivid
memories
and
wonderful
impressions
after
only
eight
days
here
for
instance
yesterday
evening
i
saw
the
flocks
of
animals
returning
from
the
hills
to
the
farm
the
and
i
swear
that
i
would
swap
this
one
hillside
wonder
for
a
whole
week
worth
of
in
paris
well
i
let
you
be
the
judge
here
in
provence
it
normal
practice
to
send
the
sheep
into
the
mountains
when
it
warm
enough
in
the
spring
and
for
five
or
six
months
man
and
beast
live
together
with
nothing
but
the
sky
for
a
roof
and
grass
for
a
bed
when
the
first
autumn
chill
is
felt
in
the
air
they
are
brought
back
down
to
the
and
they
can
graze
comfortably
on
the
nearby
hills
this
annual
delight
the
return
of
the
flock
was
accomplished
last
night
the
double
barn
doors
had
been
left
expectantly
open
since
daybreak
and
the
barn
had
already
been
covered
with
fresh
straw
there
was
occasional
excited
speculation
about
the
flock
exact
whereabouts
now
they
are
in
eyguières
or
they
are
in
paradou
was
rumoured
then
suddenly
towards
evening
we
heard
a
rousing
shout
of
here
they
come
and
we
could
see
the
magnificent
cloud
of
dust
that
heralded
the
approach
of
the
flock
as
it
continued
along
its
way
it
seemed
to
gather
everything
into
its
path
to
join
the
great
march
home
the
old
rams
horns
assertively
pointing
forward
lead
the
way
with
the
rest
of
the
sheep
behind
the
ewes
looked
tired
out
with
their
lambs
getting
under
their
feet
mules
bedecked
with
red
were
carrying
lambs
in
baskets
and
rocking
them
to
sleep
with
a
gentle
motion
then
came
the
breathless
overworked
dogs
tongues
hanging
out
in
the
company
of
two
strapping
shepherds
in
their
red
serge
cloaks
the
whole
parade
filed
merrily
past
before
being
swallowed
up
by
the
open
barn
doors
they
shuffled
inside
with
a
noise
like
a
tropical
downpour
you
should
have
seen
the
turmoil
inside
the
huge
silken
green
and
gold
peacocks
loudly
trumpeted
their
welcome
as
they
recognised
the
new
arrivals
the
hens
scattered
everywhere
as
they
were
woken
up
all
the
pigeons
ducks
turkeys
and
were
running
or
flying
wildly
about
the
whole
poultry
yard
was
going
absolutely
mad
you
think
that
every
single
sheep
had
brought
back
an
intoxicating
dose
of
wild
mountain
air
in
its
fleece
which
had
made
all
the
other
animals
hopping
mad
in
the
midst
of
all
this
commotion
the
flock
somehow
managed
to
settle
themselves
in
you
could
imagine
anything
more
charming
than
this
homecoming
the
old
rams
relaxed
visibly
at
the
sight
of
their
home
farm
while
the
tiny
lambs
born
during
the
descent
looked
all
around
in
astonished
wonder
but
it
was
the
dogs
that
were
the
most
touching
the
gentle
sheep
dogs
who
had
busily
looked
after
their
charges
until
they
were
all
safely
back
in
the
farm
the
guard
dog
barking
from
his
kennel
did
his
best
to
call
them
over
and
the
brimming
over
with
cool
water
also
competed
to
tempt
them
but
nothing
nothing
could
distract
them
at
least
not
until
the
livestock
were
all
safely
inside
the
pen
the
small
gate
securely
latched
by
its
large
bolt
and
the
shepherds
seated
at
the
table
of
their
room
only
then
were
they
content
to
go
to
their
dog
pound
lap
up
their
slop
and
spread
the
news
to
the
other
animals
of
the
adventures
they
had
had
in
the
mountains
that
mysterious
world
of
wolves
and
tall
purple
foxgloves
brimming
over
with
dew
the
coach
from
beaucaire
i
took
the
coach
from
beaucaire
to
get
to
my
windmill
it
was
a
good
old
patache
a
sort
of
rural
coach
which
although
it
only
made
short
trips
dawdled
so
much
that
by
the
end
of
the
day
it
had
the
wearied
air
of
having
travelled
a
long
way
there
were
five
of
us
on
top
plus
the
driver
of
course
there
was
a
hairy
and
camargue
ranger
with
big
eyes
and
sporting
silver
earrings
there
were
two
men
from
beaucaire
a
baker
and
his
dough
mixer
ruddy
and
wheezy
as
befits
their
trade
but
with
the
magnificent
profiles
of
a
roman
emperor
lastly
there
was
this
fellow
no
not
a
person
really
just
a
cap
you
were
only
aware
of
the
cap
an
enormous
cap
he
said
little
gazing
miserably
at
the
passing
road
these
characters
well
known
to
each
other
were
speaking
very
loudly
and
even
more
freely
about
their
personal
business
the
ranger
announced
that
he
was
making
for
nîmes
in
response
to
a
summons
for
a
shepherd
they
these
camargue
folk
as
for
the
men
from
beaucaire
they
were
at
each
others
throats
about
the
virgin
mary
it
appears
that
the
baker
was
from
a
parish
dedicated
to
the
madonna
known
in
provence
as
the
holy
mother
and
always
pictured
carrying
the
baby
jesus
in
her
arms
his
on
the
other
hand
was
a
at
a
new
church
dedicated
to
the
immaculate
conception
whose
icon
showed
her
with
open
arms
and
illuminated
hands
the
way
they
treated
each
other
and
their
respective
madonnas
had
to
be
seen
to
be
believed
she
no
more
than
a
pretty
girl
your
immaculate
lady
well
you
know
what
you
can
do
with
your
holy
mother
she
was
no
better
around
palestine
than
she
should
have
been
yours
what
about
yours
the
little
minx
who
knows
what
she
got
up
to
only
joseph
can
answer
that
you
have
thought
we
were
on
the
docks
in
naples
in
truth
it
only
needed
the
glint
of
a
knife
blade
i
sure
to
settle
this
fine
theological
point
once
and
for
all
that
is
if
the
driver
intervened
give
us
some
peace
you
and
your
madonnas
he
said
laughingly
trying
to
make
light
of
the
beaucairian
dispute
it
women
stuff
this
men
should
get
involved
he
cracked
his
whip
from
his
high
perch
as
if
to
emphasise
to
his
lack
of
religious
conviction
and
to
bring
the
others
into
line
end
of
discussion
but
the
baker
having
been
stopped
in
full
flow
wanted
to
continue
in
the
same
vein
and
turned
his
attention
towards
the
miserable
cap
still
morosely
huddled
in
its
corner
and
quietly
sneered
you
there
grinder
what
about
your
wife
what
side
of
the
parish
border
does
she
stand
on
it
was
as
though
it
was
meant
to
be
a
joke
the
whole
of
them
erupted
into
uproarious
laughter
except
the
grinder
himself
who
did
react
to
the
remark
this
prompted
the
baker
to
turn
towards
me
you
do
happen
to
know
his
wife
do
you
monsieur
just
as
well
she
a
real
queer
fish
there
ca
be
another
one
like
her
in
beaucaire
the
increasing
laughter
left
the
grinder
unmoved
except
for
a
whisper
his
eyes
still
downcast
hush
baker
but
there
was
no
stopping
this
interfering
baker
and
he
warmed
to
his
theme
he
an
idiot
no
man
of
the
world
would
complain
about
having
wife
like
that
there
never
a
dull
moment
when
she
around
think
about
it
a
really
gorgeous
girl
who
every
six
months
or
so
ups
sticks
and
runs
away
and
believe
me
always
has
a
pretty
tale
to
tell
when
she
gets
back
that
the
way
it
is
a
funny
old
menagerie
that
one
work
it
out
monsieur
they
had
even
been
hitched
a
year
when
she
breezed
off
to
spain
with
a
chocolate
merchant
the
husband
was
inconsolable
after
that
sitting
alone
and
drinking
and
crying
all
the
time
like
a
man
possessed
after
a
while
she
drifted
back
into
the
area
dressed
like
a
spaniard
complete
with
tambourine
we
all
warned
her
you
better
get
lost
he
kill
you
kill
her
indeed
oh
yes
i
should
say
so
they
made
it
up
beautifully
she
even
taught
him
how
to
play
the
tambourine
like
a
basque
once
again
the
coach
rocked
with
laughter
once
again
the
grinder
still
did
budge
just
murmured
again
hush
baker
the
baker
ignored
this
plea
and
went
on
you
might
think
after
her
return
from
spain
monsieur
the
little
beauty
would
keep
herself
to
herself
but
oh
no
her
husband
accepted
the
situation
again
so
easily
it
has
to
be
said
that
she
was
at
it
again
after
spain
there
was
an
army
officer
then
a
sailor
from
the
rhone
then
a
musician
then
who
knows
what
is
certain
is
that
every
time
it
the
same
french
farce
she
leaves
he
cries
she
comes
back
he
gets
over
it
you
better
believe
it
he
a
long
suffering
cuckold
that
one
but
you
got
to
admit
she
is
a
real
the
little
a
piece
fit
for
a
king
full
of
life
sweet
as
could
be
and
a
lovely
bit
of
stuff
to
top
it
all
she
has
a
skin
like
alabaster
and
hazel
eyes
that
always
seem
to
be
smiling
at
men
my
word
paris
if
you
ever
pass
through
beaucaire
again
oh
do
be
quiet
baker
i
beg
you
the
poor
grinder
went
once
again
his
voice
beginning
to
break
up
just
then
the
diligence
stopped
at
the
anglores
farm
here
it
was
that
the
two
beaucaire
men
got
off
and
believe
me
i
did
try
to
stop
them
what
a
sort
of
baker
he
was
even
when
he
was
in
the
farmyard
we
could
still
hear
him
laughing
with
those
two
characters
gone
the
coach
seemed
empty
we
dropped
the
camargue
ranger
in
arles
and
the
driver
led
the
horses
on
foot
from
there
just
the
grinder
and
myself
were
left
on
top
each
silent
and
alone
it
was
very
warm
the
coach
leather
hood
was
too
hot
to
touch
at
times
i
could
feel
my
head
and
eyelids
getting
heavy
and
tired
but
the
unsettling
yet
placid
plea
of
be
quiet
i
beg
you
kept
echoing
in
my
mind
and
would
let
me
nod
off
no
rest
for
that
poor
soul
either
i
could
see
from
behind
that
his
broad
shoulders
were
shaking
and
his
course
pale
hand
trembled
on
the
back
of
the
seat
like
an
old
man
he
was
crying
this
is
your
place
paris
the
driver
said
pointing
out
my
green
hillock
with
the
tip
of
his
whip
and
there
like
a
huge
butterfly
on
a
hump
was
my
windmill
i
hurried
to
dismount
but
as
i
passed
by
the
grinder
i
wanted
to
get
look
at
him
under
his
cap
before
leaving
the
unfortunate
man
jerked
his
head
back
as
if
reading
my
mind
and
fixed
me
with
his
eyes
mark
me
well
friend
he
mumbled
and
if
one
day
you
hear
of
a
tragedy
in
beaucaire
you
can
say
you
know
who
did
it
he
was
a
beaten
sad
man
with
small
eyes
eyes
that
were
filled
with
tears
but
the
voice
the
voice
was
full
of
hatred
hatred
is
the
weak
man
anger
if
i
were
the
i
be
very
careful
cornille
secret
francet
mamaï
an
aging
fife
player
who
occasionally
passes
the
evening
hours
drinking
sweet
wine
with
me
recently
told
me
about
a
little
drama
which
unfolded
in
the
village
near
my
windmill
some
twenty
years
ago
the
fellow
tale
was
quite
touching
and
i
try
to
tell
it
to
you
as
i
heard
it
for
a
moment
think
of
yourself
sitting
next
to
a
flagon
of
wine
listening
to
the
old
fife
player
giving
forth
our
land
my
dear
monsieur
has
always
been
the
dead
and
alive
place
it
is
today
in
the
old
days
it
was
a
great
milling
centre
serving
the
farmers
from
many
kilometres
around
who
brought
their
wheat
here
to
be
ground
into
flour
the
village
was
surrounded
by
hills
covered
in
windmills
on
every
side
above
the
pine
trees
sails
turning
in
the
mistral
filled
the
landscape
and
an
assortment
of
small
donkeys
trudged
up
and
down
the
paths
day
after
day
it
was
really
good
to
hear
the
crack
of
the
whips
the
snap
of
the
sails
and
the
miller
men
prodding
on
sundays
we
used
to
go
up
to
the
windmills
in
droves
and
the
millers
thanked
us
with
muscat
wine
the
miller
wives
looked
as
pretty
as
pictures
with
their
lace
shawls
and
gold
crosses
i
took
my
fife
of
course
and
we
farandoled
the
night
away
those
windmills
mark
me
were
the
heart
and
soul
of
our
world
then
some
parisians
came
up
with
the
unfortunate
idea
of
establishing
a
new
steam
flour
mill
on
the
tarascon
road
people
soon
began
sending
their
wheat
to
the
factory
and
the
poor
started
to
lose
their
living
for
a
while
they
tried
to
fight
back
but
steam
was
the
coming
thing
and
it
eventually
finished
them
off
one
by
one
they
had
to
close
down
no
more
dear
little
donkeys
no
more
muscat
and
no
more
farandoling
the
millers
wives
were
selling
their
gold
crosses
to
help
make
ends
meet
the
mistral
might
just
as
well
not
have
bothered
for
all
the
turning
the
windmills
did
then
one
day
the
commune
ordered
the
destruction
of
all
the
windmills
and
the
land
was
used
to
plant
vines
and
olive
trees
even
during
of
all
this
demolition
one
windmill
had
prevailed
and
managed
to
keep
going
and
was
still
bravely
turning
on
right
under
the
mill
factors
noses
it
was
cornille
mill
yes
this
actual
one
we
chewing
the
fat
in
right
now
cornille
was
an
old
miller
who
had
lived
and
breathed
flour
for
sixty
years
and
loved
his
milling
above
all
other
things
the
opening
of
the
factories
had
enraged
him
to
distraction
for
a
whole
week
he
was
stirring
up
the
locals
in
the
village
and
screaming
that
the
mill
factories
would
poison
the
whole
of
provence
with
their
flour
have
anything
to
do
with
them
he
said
those
thieves
use
steam
the
devil
own
wind
while
i
work
with
the
very
breath
of
god
the
tramontana
and
the
mistral
he
was
using
all
manner
of
fine
words
in
praise
of
windmills
but
nobody
was
listening
from
then
on
the
raving
old
man
just
shut
himself
away
in
his
windmill
and
lived
alone
like
a
caged
animal
he
did
even
want
vivette
his
fifteen
year
old
grand
daughter
around
she
only
had
her
grandfather
to
depend
on
since
the
death
of
her
parents
so
the
poor
little
thing
had
to
earn
her
living
from
any
farm
needing
help
with
the
harvest
the
or
the
olive
picking
and
yet
her
grandfather
still
displayed
all
the
signs
of
loving
vivette
and
he
would
often
walk
in
the
midday
sun
to
see
her
in
the
farm
where
she
was
working
and
he
would
spend
many
hours
watching
her
and
breaking
his
heart
people
thought
that
the
old
miller
was
simply
being
miserly
in
sending
vivette
away
in
their
opinion
it
was
utterly
shameful
to
let
his
trail
from
farm
to
farm
running
the
risk
that
the
supervisors
would
bully
and
abuse
her
and
that
she
would
suffer
all
the
usual
horrors
of
child
labour
cornille
who
had
once
been
respected
now
roamed
the
streets
like
a
gypsy
with
a
hole
in
his
hat
and
his
breeches
in
shreds
in
fact
when
he
went
to
mass
on
sundays
we
his
own
generation
were
ashamed
of
him
and
he
sensed
this
to
the
point
that
he
would
come
and
sit
in
the
front
pews
with
us
he
always
sat
by
the
font
at
the
back
of
the
church
with
the
parish
poor
there
was
something
mysterious
about
cornille
life
for
some
time
nobody
in
the
village
had
brought
him
any
wheat
and
yet
his
sails
kept
on
turning
in
the
evenings
the
old
miller
could
be
seen
on
the
pathways
driving
his
laden
mule
along
good
evening
cornille
the
peasants
called
over
to
him
everything
alright
then
oh
yes
lads
the
old
fellow
replied
cheerily
thank
god
there
no
shortage
of
work
for
me
if
you
asked
him
where
the
work
was
coming
from
he
would
put
a
finger
to
his
mouth
and
reply
with
great
seriousness
keep
it
under
your
hat
it
for
export
you
could
never
get
anything
more
than
that
out
of
him
you
dare
even
think
about
poking
your
nose
inside
the
windmill
even
little
vivette
would
go
in
there
the
door
was
always
shut
when
you
passed
by
the
huge
sails
were
always
turning
the
old
donkey
was
grazing
on
the
mill
apron
and
a
cat
was
sunning
itself
on
the
windowsill
and
eying
you
viciously
all
this
gave
it
an
air
of
mystery
causing
much
gossip
each
person
had
his
own
version
of
cornille
secret
but
the
general
view
was
that
there
were
more
sacks
of
money
than
sacks
of
flour
in
the
windmill
eventually
though
everything
was
revealed
listen
to
this
one
day
playing
my
fife
at
the
youngsters
dance
i
noticed
that
the
eldest
of
my
boys
and
little
vivette
had
fallen
in
love
deep
down
i
was
not
sorry
after
all
cornille
was
a
respected
name
in
our
village
and
then
again
it
had
pleased
me
to
see
this
pretty
little
bundle
of
fluff
vivette
skipping
around
the
house
but
as
our
lovers
had
lots
of
opportunities
to
be
alone
together
i
wanted
to
put
the
affair
on
a
proper
footing
at
once
for
fear
of
accidents
so
i
went
up
to
the
windmill
to
have
a
few
words
with
her
grandfather
but
oh
the
old
devil
you
would
credit
the
manner
of
his
welcome
i
could
get
him
to
open
the
door
i
told
him
through
the
keyhole
that
my
intentions
were
good
and
meanwhile
that
damned
cat
was
spitting
like
anything
above
my
head
the
old
man
cut
me
short
and
told
me
unfairly
to
get
back
to
my
flute
playing
and
that
if
i
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
marry
off
my
boy
i
be
better
going
to
look
for
one
of
the
factory
girls
you
can
imagine
how
much
these
words
made
my
blood
boil
but
wisely
i
was
able
to
control
myself
and
left
the
old
fool
to
his
grinding
i
went
back
to
tell
the
children
of
my
disappointment
the
poor
lambs
believe
it
and
they
asked
me
if
they
could
go
to
speak
to
him
i
could
refuse
and
in
a
flash
the
lovers
went
when
they
arrived
cornille
had
just
left
the
door
was
double
locked
but
he
had
left
his
ladder
outside
the
children
immediately
went
in
through
the
window
to
see
what
was
inside
this
famous
windmill
amazingly
the
milling
room
was
empty
not
a
single
sack
not
one
grain
of
wheat
not
the
least
trace
of
flour
on
the
walls
or
in
the
cobwebs
there
was
even
the
good
warm
scent
of
crushed
wheat
which
permeates
windmills
the
grinding
machinery
was
covered
in
dust
and
the
starving
cat
was
asleep
on
it
the
room
below
had
just
the
same
air
of
misery
and
neglect
a
pitiful
bed
a
few
rags
a
piece
of
bread
on
a
step
of
the
stairs
and
notably
in
one
corner
three
or
four
burst
sacks
with
rubble
and
chalk
spilling
out
so
that
was
cornille
secret
it
was
this
plaster
that
was
being
moved
by
road
in
the
evenings
all
this
just
to
save
the
reputation
of
the
windmill
to
make
people
believe
that
flour
was
still
being
milled
there
poor
windmill
poor
cornille
the
millers
had
finished
the
last
real
work
a
long
time
ago
the
sails
turned
on
but
the
millstone
did
the
children
returned
tearfully
and
told
me
what
they
had
seen
it
broke
my
heart
to
hear
them
i
ran
round
to
the
neighbours
straight
away
explaining
things
very
briefly
and
we
all
agreed
at
once
on
what
to
do
which
was
to
carry
all
the
wheat
we
could
lay
our
hands
on
up
to
cornille
windmill
no
sooner
said
than
done
the
whole
village
met
up
on
the
way
and
we
arrived
with
a
procession
of
donkeys
loaded
up
with
wheat
but
this
time
the
real
thing
the
windmill
was
open
to
the
world
in
front
of
the
door
crying
head
in
hands
sat
cornille
on
a
sack
of
plaster
he
had
only
just
come
back
and
noticed
that
while
he
was
away
his
home
had
been
invaded
and
his
pathetic
secret
exposed
poor
poor
me
he
said
i
might
as
well
be
dead
the
windmill
has
been
shamed
then
sobbing
bitter
tears
he
tried
to
say
all
sorts
of
consoling
words
to
his
windmill
as
if
it
could
hear
him
just
then
the
mules
arrived
on
the
apron
and
we
all
began
to
shout
loudly
as
in
the
good
old
days
of
the
millers
what
ho
there
in
the
windmill
what
ho
there
monsieur
cornille
and
there
they
were
stacked
together
sack
upon
sack
of
lovely
golden
grain
some
spilling
over
onto
the
ground
all
around
cornille
his
eyes
wide
open
took
some
of
the
wheat
into
the
palms
of
his
old
hands
crying
and
laughing
at
the
same
time
it
wheat
dear
lord
real
wheat
leave
me
to
feast
my
eyes
then
turning
towards
us
he
said
i
know
why
you
come
back
to
me
the
mill
factory
owners
are
all
thieves
we
wanted
to
lift
him
shoulder
high
and
take
him
triumphantly
to
the
village
no
no
my
children
i
must
give
my
windmill
something
to
go
at
first
think
about
it
for
so
long
it
had
nothing
to
grind
we
all
had
tears
in
our
eyes
as
we
saw
the
old
man
scampering
from
sack
to
sack
and
emptying
them
into
the
millstone
and
watching
as
the
fine
flour
was
ground
out
onto
the
floor
it
fair
to
say
that
from
then
on
we
never
let
the
old
miller
run
short
of
work
then
one
morning
cornille
died
and
the
sails
of
our
last
working
windmill
turned
for
the
very
last
time
once
he
had
gone
no
one
took
his
place
what
could
we
do
monsieur
everything
comes
to
an
end
in
this
world
and
we
have
to
accept
that
the
time
for
windmills
has
gone
along
with
the
days
of
the
barges
on
the
rhone
local
parliaments
and
floral
jackets
monsieur
seguin
last
kid
goat
pierre
gringoire
lyrical
poet
you
never
get
anywhere
gringoire
i
ca
believe
it
a
good
newspaper
in
paris
offers
you
a
job
as
a
critic
and
you
have
the
brass
neck
to
turn
it
down
look
at
yourself
old
friend
look
at
the
holes
in
your
doublet
your
stockings
and
your
pinched
face
which
betrays
your
hunger
look
where
your
passion
for
poetry
has
got
you
see
how
much
you
have
been
valued
for
your
ten
years
writing
for
the
gods
what
price
pride
after
all
take
the
job
you
idiot
become
a
critic
you
get
good
money
have
your
reserved
table
in
brébant
you
will
be
seen
at
premieres
and
it
will
secure
your
reputation
no
you
do
want
to
you
prefer
to
stay
as
free
as
the
air
to
the
end
of
your
days
very
well
then
listen
to
the
story
of
last
kid
you
see
where
hankering
after
your
freedom
gets
you
monsieur
seguin
never
had
much
luck
with
his
goats
he
lost
them
all
one
after
another
in
the
same
way
one
fine
morning
they
would
break
free
from
their
tethers
and
scamper
off
up
into
the
mountain
where
they
were
gobbled
up
by
the
big
bad
wolf
neither
their
master
care
nor
the
fear
of
the
wolf
nor
anything
else
could
hold
them
back
they
were
or
so
it
seemed
goats
who
wanted
freedom
and
open
spaces
whatever
the
cost
monsieur
seguin
who
did
understand
his
animals
ways
was
dismayed
he
said
it
all
over
goats
get
fed
up
here
i
have
managed
to
keep
a
single
one
of
them
but
he
had
totally
lost
heart
for
even
after
losing
six
goats
he
still
bought
a
seventh
this
time
he
made
sure
to
get
it
very
young
so
she
would
settle
down
better
oh
gringoire
she
was
really
lovely
monsieur
seguin
little
kid
goat
with
her
gentle
eyes
her
goatee
beard
her
black
shiny
hooves
her
striped
horns
and
her
long
white
fur
which
made
a
fine
greatcoat
for
her
it
was
nearly
as
delightful
as
esmeralda
kid
goat
do
you
remember
her
gringoire
and
then
again
she
was
affectionate
and
docile
holding
still
while
she
was
milked
never
putting
her
foot
in
the
bowl
a
lovely
a
dear
little
goat
there
was
a
hawthorn
enclosure
behind
monsieur
seguin
house
where
he
placed
his
new
boarder
he
tied
her
to
a
stake
in
the
finest
part
of
the
field
taking
care
that
she
had
plenty
of
rope
and
often
went
out
to
see
how
she
was
faring
the
goat
appeared
to
be
very
happy
and
was
grazing
heartily
on
the
grass
which
delighted
monsieur
seguin
at
last
triumphed
the
poor
man
this
one
is
getting
bored
here
monsieur
seguin
was
wrong
his
goat
was
becoming
very
bored
one
day
looking
over
towards
the
mountain
she
remarked
how
great
it
must
be
up
there
how
lovely
to
gambol
on
the
heath
without
this
rope
tether
that
chafes
my
neck
it
alright
for
an
ox
or
a
donkey
to
graze
all
cooped
up
but
we
goats
should
be
able
to
roam
free
from
then
on
she
found
the
grass
in
the
enclosure
bland
boredom
overcame
her
she
lost
weight
and
her
milk
all
but
dried
up
it
was
pitiful
to
see
her
pulling
at
her
tether
all
day
with
her
head
turned
towards
the
mountain
nostrils
flared
and
bleating
sadly
monsieur
seguin
noticed
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
her
but
he
could
work
out
what
it
was
one
morning
as
he
finished
milking
her
she
turned
towards
him
and
said
to
him
in
her
own
way
listen
monsieur
seguin
i
am
pining
away
here
let
me
go
into
the
mountain
oh
my
god
not
you
as
well
screamed
monsieur
seguin
dropping
his
bowl
stupefied
then
sitting
down
in
the
grass
beside
his
goat
he
added
so
my
blanquette
you
want
to
leave
me
blanquette
replied
yes
monsieur
seguin
are
you
short
of
grass
here
oh
no
monsieur
seguin
perhaps
your
tether
is
too
short
shall
i
lengthen
it
not
worth
your
while
monsieur
seguin
well
then
what
do
you
need
what
do
you
want
want
to
go
up
into
the
mountain
monsieur
seguin
but
my
poor
dear
do
you
realise
that
there
is
a
big
bad
wolf
on
the
mountain
what
will
you
do
when
he
turns
up
i
will
butt
him
monsieur
seguin
the
big
bad
wolf
does
give
a
fig
for
your
horns
he
eaten
many
a
kid
goat
with
bigger
horns
than
yours
have
you
thought
about
poor
old
renaude
who
was
here
only
last
year
she
was
really
strong
and
wilful
she
was
more
like
a
she
fought
off
the
wolf
all
night
in
the
morning
the
wolf
still
ate
her
though
poor
poor
renaude
but
that
does
alter
anything
monsieur
seguin
let
me
go
into
the
mountain
goodness
he
said
what
am
i
to
do
with
these
goats
of
mine
yet
another
one
for
the
wolf
belly
well
i
not
going
to
have
it
i
will
save
you
despite
yourself
you
rascal
and
to
avoid
the
risk
of
your
breaking
loose
i
am
going
to
lock
you
in
the
cowshed
and
you
will
stay
there
without
further
ado
monsieur
seguin
carried
the
goat
into
the
pitch
blackness
of
the
cowshed
and
locked
and
bolted
the
door
unfortunately
he
had
forgotten
to
shut
the
window
and
he
had
hardly
turned
his
back
when
she
got
free
are
you
laughing
gringoire
heavens
i
quite
sure
you
are
on
the
goats
side
and
not
monsieur
seguin
we
see
if
you
manage
to
keep
laughing
there
was
general
delight
when
the
white
goat
arrived
on
the
mountain
the
old
fir
trees
had
never
seen
anything
nearly
so
lovely
she
was
received
like
a
queen
the
chestnut
trees
bowed
down
to
the
ground
to
stroke
her
with
the
tips
of
their
leaves
the
brooms
opened
up
the
way
for
her
and
brushed
against
her
as
best
they
could
the
whole
mountainside
celebrated
her
arrival
so
gringoire
imagine
how
happy
our
goat
was
no
more
tether
no
more
stake
nothing
to
prevent
her
from
going
where
she
wanted
and
nibbling
at
anything
she
liked
hereabouts
there
was
lots
of
grass
she
was
up
to
her
horns
in
it
my
friend
and
what
grass
delicious
fine
feathery
and
dense
so
much
better
than
that
in
the
enclosure
and
then
there
were
the
flowers
huge
bluebells
purple
foxgloves
a
whole
forest
full
of
wild
blooms
brimming
over
with
heady
sap
the
white
goat
wallowed
in
it
and
with
her
legs
flailing
in
the
air
rolled
along
the
bank
all
over
the
place
on
the
fallen
leaves
in
amongst
the
chestnut
trees
then
quite
suddenly
she
jumped
confidently
onto
her
feet
off
she
went
heedlessly
going
forward
through
the
clumps
of
boxwood
and
brooms
she
went
everywhere
up
hill
and
down
dale
you
would
have
thought
that
there
were
loads
of
monsieur
seguin
goats
on
the
mountain
clearly
blanquette
was
not
frightened
of
anything
in
one
leap
she
covered
some
large
torrential
streams
which
burst
over
her
in
a
soaking
mist
then
dripping
wet
she
stretched
herself
out
on
a
flat
rock
and
dried
herself
in
the
sun
once
approaching
the
edge
of
a
drop
a
laburnum
flower
in
her
mouth
she
noticed
monsieur
house
and
the
enclosure
far
down
on
the
plain
it
made
her
laugh
till
the
tears
came
how
small
it
all
is
she
said
how
did
i
manage
to
put
up
with
it
poor
little
thing
finding
herself
so
high
up
she
believed
herself
to
be
on
top
of
the
world
overall
it
was
a
jolly
good
day
for
monsieur
seguin
kid
goat
about
midday
scampering
all
over
the
place
she
chanced
upon
a
herd
of
chamois
munching
on
wild
vines
with
some
relish
our
little
minx
in
a
white
dress
was
an
absolute
sensation
all
these
gentlemanly
bucks
made
way
for
her
so
she
could
have
the
very
best
of
the
vines
it
even
seemed
and
this
is
for
your
ears
only
gringoire
that
one
of
the
black
coated
young
chamois
caught
blanquette
eye
the
two
lovers
got
lost
in
the
trees
for
an
hour
or
two
and
if
you
want
to
know
what
they
said
to
one
another
go
and
ask
the
babbling
brooks
who
meander
unseen
in
the
moss
suddenly
the
wind
freshened
the
mountain
turned
violet
and
evening
fell
already
said
the
little
kid
goat
and
stopped
in
astonishment
in
the
valley
the
fields
were
shrouded
in
mist
monsieur
enclosure
was
hidden
in
the
fog
and
nothing
could
be
seen
of
the
house
except
the
roof
and
a
faint
trace
of
smoke
she
heard
the
bells
of
a
flock
of
sheep
returning
home
and
began
to
feel
very
melancholy
a
returning
falcon
just
missed
her
with
his
wings
as
he
passed
over
she
winced
then
there
was
a
howl
on
the
mountain
now
the
silly
nanny
thought
about
the
big
bad
wolf
having
not
once
done
it
all
day
at
the
same
time
a
horn
sounded
far
away
in
the
valley
it
was
monsieur
seguin
making
one
last
effort
the
wolf
howled
again
come
home
come
home
cried
the
horn
blanquette
wanted
to
but
then
she
remembered
the
stake
and
the
rope
and
the
hedged
enclosure
and
she
thought
that
now
she
possibly
get
used
to
all
that
lot
again
and
it
was
better
to
stay
put
the
horn
went
silent
she
heard
a
noise
in
the
leaves
behind
her
she
turned
round
and
there
in
the
shade
she
saw
two
short
ears
and
two
shining
eyes
it
was
the
big
bad
wolf
huge
and
motionless
there
he
was
sitting
on
his
hindquarters
looking
at
the
little
white
goat
and
licking
his
chops
he
knew
full
well
that
he
would
eventually
eat
her
so
he
was
in
no
hurry
and
as
she
turned
away
he
laughed
maliciously
ha
ha
it
monsieur
seguin
little
kid
goat
and
he
licked
his
chops
once
again
with
his
red
tongue
blanquette
felt
all
was
lost
it
only
took
a
moment
thought
about
the
story
of
old
renaude
who
became
the
wolf
meal
after
bravely
fighting
all
night
to
convince
her
that
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
to
get
it
over
with
and
to
let
herself
be
eaten
there
and
then
afterwards
thinking
better
of
it
she
squared
up
to
the
big
bad
wolf
head
down
horns
ready
like
the
brave
little
kid
goat
of
monsieur
seguin
that
she
was
not
that
she
expected
to
kill
him
goats
kill
wolves
but
just
to
see
if
she
could
last
out
as
long
as
renaude
as
the
big
bad
wolf
drew
near
she
with
her
little
horns
set
to
into
the
fray
oh
the
brave
little
kid
goat
how
she
went
at
it
with
such
a
great
heart
a
dozen
times
i
swear
gringoire
she
forced
the
wolf
back
to
catch
his
breath
during
these
brief
respites
she
grabbed
a
blade
or
two
of
the
grass
that
she
loved
so
much
then
still
munching
joined
the
battle
again
the
whole
night
passed
like
this
occasionally
monsieur
seguin
kid
goat
looked
up
at
the
twinkling
stars
in
the
clear
sky
and
said
to
herself
oh
dear
i
hope
i
can
last
out
till
the
morning
one
by
one
the
stars
faded
away
blanquette
intensified
her
charges
while
the
wolf
replied
with
his
teeth
the
pale
daylight
appeared
gradually
over
the
horizon
a
cockerel
crowed
hoarsely
from
a
farm
below
at
last
said
the
poor
animal
who
was
only
waiting
for
the
morning
to
come
so
that
she
could
die
bravely
and
she
laid
herself
down
on
the
ground
her
beautiful
white
fur
stained
with
blood
it
was
then
at
last
that
the
wolf
fell
on
the
little
goat
and
devoured
her
goodbye
gringoire
the
story
you
have
heard
is
not
of
my
making
if
you
ever
come
to
provence
our
tenant
farmers
often
tell
you
of
seguin
kid
who
fought
the
big
bad
wolf
all
night
before
he
ate
her
in
the
morning
think
about
it
gringoire
big
bad
wolf
ate
her
in
the
the
stars
tale
from
a
provencal
when
i
used
to
be
in
charge
of
the
animals
on
the
luberon
i
was
in
the
pasture
for
many
weeks
with
my
dog
labri
and
the
flock
without
seeing
another
living
soul
occasionally
the
hermit
from
would
pass
by
looking
for
medicinal
herbs
or
i
might
see
the
blackened
face
of
a
chimney
sweep
from
piémont
but
these
were
simple
folk
silenced
by
the
solitude
having
lost
the
taste
for
and
knowing
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
down
in
the
villages
and
towns
so
i
was
truly
happy
when
every
fortnight
i
heard
the
bells
on
our
farm
mule
which
brought
my
provisions
and
i
saw
the
bright
little
face
of
the
farm
boy
or
the
red
hat
of
old
aunty
norade
appear
over
the
hill
i
asked
them
for
news
from
the
village
the
baptisms
marriages
and
so
on
but
what
particularly
interested
me
was
to
know
what
was
happening
to
my
master
daughter
mademoiselle
stephanette
the
loveliest
thing
for
fifty
kilometres
around
without
wishing
to
seem
i
managed
to
find
out
if
she
was
going
to
village
fetes
and
evening
farm
gatherings
and
if
she
still
turned
up
with
a
new
admirer
every
time
if
someone
asked
me
how
that
concerned
a
poor
mountain
shepherd
i
would
say
that
i
was
twenty
years
old
and
that
stephanette
was
the
loveliest
thing
i
had
seen
in
my
whole
life
one
sunday
however
the
fortnight
supplies
were
very
late
arriving
in
the
morning
i
had
thought
it
because
of
high
mass
then
about
midday
a
big
storm
got
up
which
made
me
think
that
bad
road
conditions
had
kept
the
mule
from
setting
out
then
just
after
three
as
the
sky
cleared
and
the
wet
mountain
glistened
in
the
sunshine
i
could
hear
the
mule
bells
above
the
sound
of
the
dripping
leaves
and
the
raging
streams
to
me
they
were
as
welcome
happy
and
lively
as
a
peal
of
bells
on
easter
day
but
there
was
no
little
farm
boy
or
old
aunty
norade
at
the
head
it
was
you
never
guess
my
heart
very
own
desire
friends
stephanette
in
person
sitting
comfortably
between
the
wicker
baskets
her
lovely
face
flushed
by
the
mountain
air
and
the
bracing
storm
apparently
the
young
lad
was
ill
and
aunty
norade
was
on
holiday
at
her
childrens
place
stephanette
told
me
all
this
as
she
got
off
the
mule
and
explained
that
she
was
late
because
she
had
lost
her
way
but
to
see
her
there
in
her
sunday
best
with
her
ribbon
of
flowers
her
silk
skirt
and
lace
bodice
it
looked
more
like
she
had
just
come
from
a
dance
rather
than
trying
to
find
her
way
through
the
bushes
oh
the
little
darling
my
eyes
never
tired
of
looking
at
her
i
had
never
seen
her
so
close
before
sometimes
in
winter
after
the
flocks
had
returned
to
the
plain
and
i
was
in
the
farm
for
supper
in
the
evening
she
would
come
into
the
dining
room
always
overdressed
and
rather
proud
and
rush
across
the
room
virtually
ignoring
us
but
now
there
she
was
right
in
front
of
me
all
to
myself
now
was
that
something
to
lose
your
head
over
once
she
had
taken
the
provisions
out
of
the
pannier
stephanette
began
to
take
an
interest
in
everything
hitching
up
her
lovely
sunday
skirt
which
otherwise
might
have
got
marked
she
went
into
the
compound
to
look
at
the
place
where
i
slept
the
straw
crib
with
its
lambskin
cover
my
long
cape
hanging
on
the
wall
my
shepherd
crook
and
my
catapult
all
these
things
fascinated
her
so
this
is
where
you
live
my
little
shepherd
how
tedious
it
must
be
to
be
alone
all
the
time
what
do
you
do
with
yourself
what
do
you
think
about
i
wanted
to
say
about
you
my
lady
and
i
would
have
been
lying
but
i
was
so
greatly
nonplussed
that
i
could
find
a
single
word
by
way
of
a
reply
obviously
she
picked
this
up
and
certainly
she
would
now
take
some
gentle
malicious
pleasure
in
turning
the
screw
what
about
your
girlfriend
shepherd
does
she
come
up
to
see
you
sometimes
of
course
it
would
have
to
be
the
fairy
esterelle
who
only
runs
at
the
top
of
the
mountain
or
the
fabled
golden
as
she
talked
on
she
seemed
to
me
like
the
real
fairy
esterelle
she
threw
her
head
back
with
a
cheeky
laugh
and
hurried
away
which
made
her
visit
seem
like
a
dream
goodbye
shepherd
bye
bye
lady
and
there
she
was
gone
taking
the
empty
baskets
with
her
as
she
disappeared
along
the
steep
path
stones
disturbed
by
the
hooves
seemed
to
take
my
heart
with
them
as
they
rolled
away
i
could
hear
them
for
a
very
long
time
for
the
rest
of
the
day
i
stood
there
daydreaming
hardly
daring
to
move
fearing
to
break
the
spell
towards
the
evening
as
the
base
of
the
valleys
became
a
deeper
blue
and
the
bleating
animals
flocked
together
for
their
return
to
the
compound
i
heard
someone
calling
to
me
on
the
way
down
and
there
she
was
mademoiselle
herself
but
she
was
laughing
any
more
she
was
trembling
and
wet
and
fearful
and
cold
she
would
have
me
believe
that
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
she
had
found
the
river
sorgue
was
swollen
by
the
rain
storm
and
wanting
to
cross
at
all
costs
had
risked
getting
drowned
the
worse
thing
was
that
at
that
time
of
night
there
was
no
chance
of
her
getting
back
to
the
farm
she
would
never
be
able
to
find
the
way
to
the
crossing
place
alone
and
i
could
leave
the
flock
the
thought
of
staying
the
night
on
the
mountain
troubled
her
a
great
deal
particularly
as
her
family
would
worry
about
her
i
reassured
her
as
best
i
could
the
nights
are
short
in
july
my
lady
it
only
going
to
seem
like
a
passing
unpleasant
moment
i
quickly
lit
a
good
fire
to
dry
her
feet
and
her
dress
soaked
by
the
river
i
then
placed
some
milk
and
cheese
in
front
of
her
but
the
poor
little
thing
could
turn
her
thoughts
to
either
warming
herself
or
eating
seeing
the
huge
tears
welling
up
in
her
eyes
made
me
want
to
cry
myself
meanwhile
night
had
almost
fallen
there
was
just
the
faintest
trace
of
the
sunset
left
on
the
mountains
crests
i
wanted
mademoiselle
to
go
on
into
in
the
compound
to
rest
and
recover
i
covered
the
fresh
straw
with
a
beautiful
brand
new
skin
and
i
bid
her
good
night
i
was
going
to
sit
outside
the
door
as
god
is
my
witness
i
never
had
an
unclean
thought
despite
my
burning
desire
for
her
i
had
nothing
but
a
great
feeling
of
pride
in
considering
that
there
in
a
corner
of
the
compound
close
up
to
the
flock
watching
curiously
over
her
sleeping
form
my
masters
daughter
rested
just
like
a
sheep
though
one
whiter
and
much
more
precious
than
all
the
others
trusting
me
to
guard
her
to
me
never
had
the
sky
seemed
darker
nor
the
stars
brighter
suddenly
the
wicker
fence
opened
and
the
beautiful
stephanette
appeared
she
could
sleep
the
animals
were
scrunching
the
hay
as
they
moved
or
bleating
in
their
dreams
for
now
she
just
wanted
to
come
close
to
the
fire
i
threw
my
over
her
shoulders
tickled
the
fire
and
we
sat
there
together
not
saying
anything
if
you
know
what
it
like
to
sleep
under
the
stars
at
night
you
know
that
when
we
are
normally
asleep
a
mysterious
world
awakens
in
the
solitude
and
silence
it
the
time
the
springs
babble
more
clearly
and
the
ponds
light
up
their
will
o
the
wisps
all
mountain
spirits
roam
freely
about
and
there
are
rustlings
in
the
air
imperceptible
sounds
that
might
be
branches
thickening
or
grass
growing
is
for
everyday
living
things
is
for
strange
unknown
things
if
you
not
used
to
it
it
can
terrify
you
so
it
was
with
mademoiselle
who
was
all
of
a
shiver
and
clung
to
me
very
tightly
at
the
slightest
noise
once
a
long
gloomy
cry
from
the
darkest
of
the
ponds
rose
and
fell
in
intensity
as
it
came
towards
us
at
the
same
time
a
shooting
star
flashed
above
our
heads
going
in
the
same
direction
as
if
the
moan
we
had
just
heard
was
carrying
a
light
what
that
stephanette
asked
me
in
a
whisper
a
soul
entering
heaven
my
lady
and
i
crossed
myself
she
did
the
same
but
stayed
looking
at
the
heavens
in
rapt
awe
then
she
said
to
me
is
it
true
then
that
you
shepherds
are
magicians
no
no
mademoiselle
but
here
we
live
closer
to
the
stars
and
we
know
more
about
what
happens
up
there
than
people
who
live
in
the
plains
she
kept
looking
at
the
stars
her
head
on
her
hands
wrapped
in
the
sheepskin
like
a
small
heavenly
shepherd
how
many
there
are
how
beautiful
i
have
never
seen
so
many
do
you
know
their
names
shepherd
of
course
lady
there
you
are
just
above
our
heads
that
the
milky
way
further
on
you
have
the
great
bear
and
so
he
described
to
her
in
great
detail
some
of
the
magic
of
the
panoply
one
of
the
stars
which
the
shepherds
name
maguelonne
i
said
chases
saturn
and
marries
him
every
seven
years
what
shepherd
are
there
star
marriages
then
oh
yes
my
lady
i
was
trying
to
explain
to
her
what
these
marriages
were
about
when
i
felt
something
cool
and
fine
on
my
shoulder
it
was
her
head
heavy
with
sleep
placed
on
me
with
just
a
delightful
brush
of
her
ribbons
lace
and
dark
tresses
she
stayed
just
like
that
unmoving
right
until
the
stars
faded
in
the
coming
daylight
as
for
me
i
watched
her
sleeping
being
somewhat
troubled
in
my
soul
but
that
clear
night
which
had
only
ever
given
me
beautiful
thoughts
had
kept
me
in
an
innocent
frame
of
mind
the
stars
all
around
us
continued
their
stately
silent
journey
like
a
great
docile
flock
in
the
sky
at
times
i
imagined
that
one
of
these
stars
the
finest
one
the
most
brilliant
having
lost
its
way
had
come
to
settle
gently
on
my
shoulder
to
sleep
the
arlesienne
as
you
go
down
to
the
village
from
the
windmill
the
road
passes
a
farm
situated
behind
a
large
courtyard
planted
with
tall
mediterranean
nettle
trees
it
a
typical
house
of
a
provencal
tenant
farmer
with
its
red
tiles
large
brown
façade
and
haphazardly
placed
doors
and
windows
it
has
a
right
on
top
of
the
loft
and
a
pulley
to
hoist
hay
with
a
few
tufts
of
old
hay
sticking
out
what
was
it
about
this
particular
house
that
struck
me
why
did
the
closed
gate
freeze
my
blood
i
do
know
but
i
do
know
that
the
house
gave
me
the
shivers
it
was
choked
by
an
eerie
silence
no
dogs
barked
guinea
fowl
scattered
silently
nothing
was
heard
from
inside
the
grounds
not
even
the
ubiquitous
mule
bell
were
it
not
for
white
curtains
at
the
windows
and
smoke
rising
from
the
roof
the
place
could
have
been
deserted
yesterday
around
midday
i
was
walking
back
from
the
village
by
the
walls
of
the
farm
in
the
shade
of
the
old
nettle
trees
when
i
saw
some
quietly
finishing
loading
a
hay
wain
on
the
road
in
front
of
the
farm
the
gate
had
been
left
open
and
discovered
a
tall
old
man
at
the
back
of
the
yard
with
his
elbows
on
a
large
stone
table
and
his
head
in
his
hands
he
was
wearing
an
jacket
and
tattered
trousers
the
sight
of
him
stopped
me
in
my
tracks
one
of
the
men
whispered
almost
inaudibly
to
me
sush
it
the
master
he
been
like
that
since
his
son
death
at
that
moment
a
woman
and
a
small
boy
both
dressed
in
black
and
accompanied
by
fat
and
villagers
passed
near
us
and
went
into
the
farm
the
man
went
on
the
lady
and
the
youngest
cadet
are
coming
back
from
the
mass
every
day
it
the
same
thing
since
the
eldest
killed
himself
oh
monsieur
what
a
tragedy
the
father
still
goes
round
in
his
mourning
weeds
nothing
will
stop
him
the
wagon
lurched
ready
to
go
but
i
still
wanted
to
know
more
so
i
asked
the
driver
if
i
could
sit
with
him
and
it
was
up
there
in
the
hay
that
i
learned
all
about
the
tragic
story
of
young
jan
was
an
admirable
countryman
of
twenty
as
as
a
girl
and
he
was
very
handsome
and
so
caught
the
eye
of
lots
of
women
but
he
had
eyes
for
only
one
a
petite
girl
from
arles
velvet
and
lace
vision
whom
he
had
once
met
in
the
town
main
square
this
was
well
received
at
first
in
the
farm
the
girl
was
known
as
a
flirt
and
her
parents
were
local
people
but
jan
wanted
her
whatever
the
cost
he
said
i
will
die
if
i
do
have
her
and
so
it
just
had
to
be
the
marriage
was
duly
arranged
to
take
place
after
the
harvest
one
sunday
evening
the
family
were
just
finishing
dinner
in
the
courtyard
it
was
almost
a
wedding
feast
the
fiancée
was
not
there
but
her
health
and
were
toasted
throughout
the
meal
a
man
appeared
unexpectedly
at
the
door
and
stuttered
a
request
to
speak
to
estève
the
master
of
the
house
alone
estève
got
up
and
went
out
onto
the
road
monsieur
the
man
said
you
are
about
to
marry
your
boy
off
to
a
woman
who
is
a
bitch
and
has
been
my
mistress
for
two
years
i
have
proof
of
what
i
say
here
are
some
of
her
letters
her
parents
know
all
about
it
and
have
promised
her
to
me
but
since
your
son
took
an
interest
in
her
neither
she
nor
they
want
anything
to
do
with
me
and
yet
i
would
have
thought
that
after
what
has
happened
she
in
all
conscience
marry
anyone
else
i
see
said
master
estève
after
scanning
the
letters
come
in
have
a
glass
of
muscat
the
man
replied
thanks
but
i
am
too
upset
for
company
and
he
went
away
the
father
went
back
in
seemingly
unaffected
and
retook
his
place
at
the
table
where
the
meal
was
rounded
off
quite
amiably
that
evening
master
estève
went
out
into
the
fields
with
his
son
they
stayed
outside
some
time
and
when
they
did
return
the
mother
was
waiting
up
for
them
wife
said
the
farmer
bringing
their
son
to
her
hug
him
he
very
unhappy
jan
did
mention
the
arlesienne
ever
again
he
still
loved
her
though
only
more
so
now
he
knew
that
she
was
in
the
arms
of
someone
else
the
trouble
was
that
he
was
too
proud
to
say
so
and
that
what
killed
the
poor
boy
sometimes
he
would
spend
entire
days
alone
huddled
in
a
corner
motionless
at
other
times
angry
he
would
set
himself
to
work
on
the
farm
and
on
his
own
get
through
the
work
of
ten
men
when
evening
came
he
would
set
out
for
arles
and
walk
expectantly
until
he
saw
the
town
few
steeples
appearing
in
the
sunset
then
he
turned
round
and
went
home
he
never
went
any
closer
than
that
the
people
in
the
farm
did
know
what
to
do
seeing
him
always
sad
and
lonely
they
feared
the
worst
once
during
a
meal
his
mother
her
eyes
welling
with
tears
said
to
him
alright
listen
jan
if
you
really
want
her
we
will
let
you
take
her
the
father
blushing
with
shame
lowered
his
head
jan
shook
his
head
and
left
from
that
day
onwards
jan
changed
his
ways
affecting
cheerfulness
all
the
time
to
reassure
his
parents
he
was
seen
again
at
balls
cabarets
and
branding
fetes
at
the
celebrations
at
the
fonvieille
fete
he
actually
led
the
farandole
his
father
said
he
got
over
it
his
mother
however
still
had
her
fears
and
kept
an
eye
on
her
boy
more
than
ever
jan
slept
in
the
same
room
as
cadet
close
to
the
silkworms
building
the
poor
mother
even
made
up
her
bed
in
the
next
room
to
theirs
explaining
by
saying
that
the
silkworms
would
need
attention
during
the
night
then
came
the
feast
day
of
eli
patron
saint
of
farmers
there
were
great
celebrations
in
the
farm
there
was
plenty
of
for
everybody
and
the
sweet
wine
flowed
in
rivers
then
there
were
crackers
and
fireworks
and
coloured
lanterns
all
over
the
nettle
trees
long
live
eli
they
all
danced
the
farandole
until
they
dropped
cadet
scorched
his
new
smock
even
jan
looked
content
and
actually
asked
his
mother
for
a
dance
she
cried
with
joy
at
midnight
they
all
went
to
bed
everybody
was
tired
out
but
jan
himself
did
sleep
cadet
said
later
that
he
had
been
sobbing
the
whole
night
oh
i
tell
you
he
was
well
smitten
that
one
the
next
morning
the
mother
heard
someone
running
across
her
bedroom
she
felt
a
sort
of
presentiment
jan
is
that
you
jan
did
reply
he
was
already
on
the
stairs
his
mother
got
up
at
once
jan
where
are
you
going
he
went
up
into
the
loft
she
followed
him
in
heavens
name
son
he
shut
and
bolted
the
door
jan
jan
answer
me
what
are
you
doing
her
old
trembling
hands
felt
for
the
latch
a
window
opened
there
was
the
sound
of
a
body
hitting
the
courtyard
slabs
then
an
awful
silence
the
poor
lad
had
told
himself
i
love
her
too
much
i
want
to
end
it
all
oh
what
pitiful
things
we
are
it
all
too
much
even
scorn
ca
kill
love
that
morning
the
village
people
wondered
who
could
be
howling
like
that
down
there
by
estève
farm
it
was
the
mother
in
the
courtyard
by
the
stone
table
which
was
covered
with
dew
and
with
blood
she
was
wailing
over
her
son
lifeless
body
limp
in
her
arms
the
pope
mule
when
provencal
people
talked
about
an
aggressive
man
with
a
grudge
they
used
to
say
beware
of
that
man
he
is
like
the
pope
mule
who
saved
up
her
kick
for
seven
years
i
have
long
been
trying
to
find
out
where
the
saying
came
from
and
what
this
papal
mule
and
the
seven
year
kick
was
all
about
nobody
not
even
francet
mamaï
my
fife
player
who
knows
the
provencal
legends
like
the
back
of
his
hand
has
been
able
to
tell
me
francet
like
me
thinks
that
it
is
from
an
old
tale
from
avignon
but
he
has
not
heard
of
it
elsewhere
you
find
it
in
the
cicada
open
library
the
old
piper
told
me
with
a
snigger
it
seemed
a
good
idea
to
me
and
the
cicada
library
being
right
outside
my
door
i
decided
to
shut
myself
in
for
a
week
it
a
marvellous
library
well
stocked
and
open
twenty
four
hours
a
day
to
poets
and
it
is
served
by
those
little
librarians
who
make
music
for
you
all
the
time
i
stayed
in
there
for
several
delightful
days
and
after
a
week
searching
lying
on
my
back
i
came
up
with
just
what
i
was
looking
for
my
own
version
of
the
mule
with
the
famous
seven
year
grudge
the
story
is
charming
and
simple
and
i
will
tell
it
to
you
as
i
read
it
yesterday
from
a
manuscript
which
had
the
lovely
smell
of
dried
lavender
and
long
strands
of
maiden
hair
fern
for
bookmarks
if
you
had
seen
avignon
in
papal
times
you
seen
nothing
for
gaiety
life
vitality
and
a
succession
of
feasts
no
town
was
its
peer
from
morning
till
night
there
were
processions
pilgrimages
flower
strewn
streets
tapestries
cardinals
arriving
on
the
rhone
buntings
galleries
with
flags
flying
papal
soldiers
chanting
latin
in
the
squares
and
brothers
rattling
their
collecting
boxes
there
were
such
noises
coming
from
the
tallest
to
the
smallest
dwelling
which
crowded
and
buzzed
all
around
the
grand
papal
palace
like
bees
round
a
hive
there
was
the
of
the
machines
the
to
and
fro
of
the
shuttles
weaving
gold
thread
for
the
chasubles
the
little
hammer
taps
of
the
cruet
engravers
the
twanging
harmonic
scales
of
the
string
instrument
makers
the
of
the
weavers
and
above
all
that
the
peal
of
the
bells
and
the
tambourines
down
by
the
bridge
you
see
here
in
provence
when
people
are
happy
they
must
dance
and
dance
and
then
they
must
dance
again
when
the
town
streets
proved
too
narrow
for
the
farandole
the
fifers
and
tambourine
players
were
placed
in
the
cooling
breeze
of
the
rhone
le
pont
where
round
the
clock
y
dansait
y
oh
such
happy
times
such
a
happy
town
the
halberds
which
have
never
killed
anyone
the
state
prisons
used
only
to
cool
the
wine
never
any
famine
never
any
war
how
the
comtat
popes
governed
their
people
and
that
why
their
people
missed
them
so
much
there
was
one
pope
called
boniface
who
was
a
particularly
good
old
stick
oh
how
the
tears
flowed
in
avignon
when
he
died
he
was
such
a
loveable
such
a
pleasant
prince
he
would
laugh
along
with
you
as
he
sat
on
his
mule
and
when
you
got
near
to
him
were
you
a
humble
madder
plant
gatherer
or
a
great
town
magistrate
he
blessed
you
just
as
thoughtfully
truly
a
pope
from
yvetot
but
a
provencal
yvetot
with
something
joyful
in
his
laugh
a
hint
of
marjoram
in
his
biretta
and
no
sign
of
a
lady
love
the
only
romantic
delight
ever
known
to
the
good
father
was
his
vineyard
a
small
one
that
he
had
planted
himself
amongst
the
myrtles
of
a
few
kilometres
from
avignon
every
sunday
after
vespers
this
decent
man
went
to
pay
court
to
the
vineyard
as
he
sat
in
fine
sunshine
his
mule
close
by
his
cardinals
sprawled
out
under
the
vines
he
opened
a
bottle
of
vintage
wine
a
fine
wine
the
colour
of
rubies
which
has
been
known
ever
since
as
du
which
he
liked
to
sip
while
looking
fondly
at
his
vineyard
then
the
bottle
empty
and
the
daylight
fading
he
went
merrily
back
to
town
his
whole
chapter
in
tow
as
he
passed
over
the
amongst
the
drums
and
farandoles
his
mule
taking
her
cue
from
the
music
began
a
jaunty
little
amble
while
he
himself
beat
the
dance
rhythm
out
with
his
biretta
this
shocked
his
cardinals
but
not
so
the
people
who
were
delighted
by
it
and
said
what
a
good
prince
what
a
great
pope
after
his
vineyard
the
pope
loved
his
mule
more
than
anything
else
on
earth
the
old
man
was
quite
simply
besotted
with
the
creature
every
night
before
going
to
bed
he
made
sure
that
the
stable
was
locked
and
that
there
was
plenty
for
her
to
eat
also
he
never
rose
from
the
table
without
a
large
bowl
of
wine
la
made
with
sugar
herbs
and
spices
and
prepared
under
his
own
watchful
eye
he
then
took
it
personally
to
the
mule
ignoring
the
reproaches
certainly
the
beast
was
well
worth
the
trouble
for
she
was
a
handsome
black
mule
sure
footed
glossy
coated
with
a
large
full
rump
and
proudly
carrying
her
small
slim
head
fully
got
up
in
pompoms
knots
silver
bells
and
ribbons
she
also
showed
an
honest
eye
as
sweet
as
an
angel
and
her
long
ears
gave
her
a
innocent
appearance
everybody
in
avignon
loved
her
and
when
she
was
trotting
through
the
streets
they
all
looked
approvingly
at
her
and
made
a
great
fuss
of
her
for
everybody
knew
that
this
was
the
best
way
to
gain
the
pope
favour
in
all
innocence
she
had
led
many
a
one
to
good
fortune
the
proof
of
which
lay
in
the
person
of
tistet
védène
and
his
wonderful
venture
this
tistet
védène
was
in
truth
a
to
the
point
where
his
father
guy
védène
the
renowned
goldsmith
had
to
run
him
out
of
the
house
because
he
refused
to
do
anything
and
coaxed
the
apprentices
away
from
their
work
for
six
months
he
was
seen
hanging
around
every
low
place
in
avignon
he
was
mainly
to
be
seen
near
the
papal
house
though
because
this
had
something
in
mind
for
the
mule
and
as
you
will
see
it
was
something
malicious
one
day
as
his
holiness
was
out
with
his
mule
under
the
ramparts
along
came
tistet
and
accosted
him
clasping
his
hands
together
in
feigned
admiration
oh
my
lord
most
holy
father
what
a
splendid
mule
you
have
there
let
me
feast
my
eyes
on
her
oh
my
dear
pope
she
a
real
beauty
i
warrant
the
german
emperor
does
have
one
like
her
then
he
stroked
her
and
spoke
gently
to
her
as
if
she
were
a
young
lady
come
here
my
jewel
my
treasure
my
priceless
pearl
the
kind
pope
was
truly
moved
and
thought
to
himself
what
a
fine
young
boy
and
how
kind
he
is
to
my
mule
and
the
result
the
very
next
day
tistet
védène
exchanged
his
old
yellow
coat
for
a
beautiful
lace
cassock
a
purple
silk
cape
and
buckled
shoes
ready
for
his
entry
into
the
pope
choir
school
an
establishment
which
previously
had
only
taken
in
sons
of
the
nobility
or
cardinals
nephews
that
how
intrigue
was
done
but
tistet
stop
at
that
once
he
was
in
the
pope
service
the
monkey
did
exactly
the
same
tricks
he
had
mastered
before
he
was
insolent
to
everybody
having
neither
time
nor
consideration
for
anyone
but
the
mule
and
was
to
be
seen
for
ever
in
the
palace
courtyard
with
handfuls
of
oats
or
bundles
of
sainfoin
gently
shaking
the
pink
bunches
as
he
looked
at
the
holy
father
balcony
with
a
look
as
if
to
say
who
this
lovely
food
for
then
so
much
so
indeed
that
finally
the
good
pope
who
was
beginning
to
feel
his
age
decided
to
leave
the
care
of
looking
after
the
stable
and
taking
the
mule
her
bowl
of
wine
la
to
none
other
than
tistet
védène
this
did
not
amuse
the
cardinals
as
for
the
mule
it
did
amuse
her
at
all
from
now
on
at
the
time
for
her
wine
she
would
witness
five
or
six
clerics
from
the
choir
school
with
their
lace
and
capes
get
in
amongst
her
straw
then
shortly
afterwards
a
fine
warm
smell
of
caramel
and
aromatic
herbs
filled
the
stable
and
tistet
védène
appeared
carefully
carrying
the
bowl
of
wine
la
but
the
mule
agony
was
only
just
beginning
this
scented
wine
which
she
loved
so
much
and
kept
her
warm
and
made
her
walk
on
air
was
bought
to
her
in
her
very
own
manger
where
it
was
put
right
under
her
nose
and
then
just
as
her
flared
nostrils
were
full
of
it
it
was
cruelly
snatched
away
and
the
beautiful
rosy
red
liqueur
disappeared
down
the
throats
of
those
clerical
brats
if
only
they
had
been
satisfied
with
just
stealing
the
wine
from
her
but
there
was
more
to
come
they
were
like
demons
these
clerical
nobodies
after
they
had
drunk
the
wine
one
pulled
her
ears
another
her
tail
and
while
quiquet
mounted
her
béluguet
tried
his
biretta
on
her
but
not
one
of
these
thugs
realised
that
with
one
butt
or
kick
in
the
kidneys
the
brave
animal
could
have
sent
them
all
to
kingdom
come
or
beyond
but
she
would
she
was
not
the
pope
mule
for
nothing
the
mule
associated
with
benedictions
and
indulgences
they
often
did
their
worst
but
she
kept
her
temper
under
control
it
was
just
tistet
védène
that
she
really
hated
when
she
felt
him
behind
her
her
hoof
would
itch
to
give
him
what
for
the
villainous
tistet
played
some
terrible
tricks
on
her
and
after
a
drink
or
two
he
came
up
with
some
very
cruel
inventions
one
day
he
decided
to
drive
her
up
the
bell
tower
of
the
choir
school
to
the
very
pinnacle
of
the
palace
this
really
happened
two
hundred
thousand
provencal
folk
will
tell
you
they
seen
it
imagine
the
terror
of
the
luckless
mule
when
after
being
shoved
blindly
up
a
spiral
staircase
and
climbing
who
knows
how
many
steps
she
found
herself
suddenly
dazzled
on
a
brilliantly
lit
platform
from
where
she
could
see
the
whole
of
a
fantastic
avignon
far
below
her
the
market
stalls
no
bigger
than
hazel
nuts
the
pope
soldiers
in
front
of
their
barracks
looking
like
red
ants
and
there
on
a
silvery
thread
a
tiny
microscopic
bridge
where
y
dansait
y
oh
the
poor
beast
she
really
panicked
she
cried
out
loud
enough
to
rattle
the
palace
windows
what
the
matter
what
happening
to
her
cried
the
pope
rushing
to
his
balcony
tistet
védène
already
back
down
in
the
courtyard
was
pretending
to
cry
and
pull
out
his
hair
oh
most
holy
father
it
it
your
mule
my
lord
how
will
it
all
end
your
mule
has
climbed
up
into
the
bell
tower
all
alone
yes
most
holy
father
all
alone
look
look
at
her
up
there
ca
you
see
the
end
her
ears
sticking
up
they
look
like
a
couple
of
swallows
from
here
god
help
us
said
the
pope
beside
himself
and
looking
up
she
must
have
gone
mad
she
going
to
kill
herself
come
down
you
fool
well
there
was
nothing
she
would
have
liked
better
but
how
the
stairs
were
not
to
be
entertained
you
could
climb
them
alright
but
coming
down
was
a
different
story
there
were
a
hundred
different
ways
to
break
your
legs
the
poor
mule
was
very
distressed
and
wandered
about
the
platform
her
huge
eyes
spinning
from
vertigo
and
contemplated
tistet
védène
well
you
swine
if
i
get
out
of
this
alive
tomorrow
morning
will
bring
you
such
a
kicking
the
thought
of
revenge
revitalised
her
without
it
she
possibly
have
held
on
at
last
somebody
managed
to
bring
her
down
but
it
was
quite
a
struggle
needing
ropes
a
block
and
tackle
and
a
cradle
imagine
what
a
humiliation
it
was
for
a
pope
mule
to
find
herself
hanging
from
a
great
height
legs
thrashing
about
like
a
fly
caught
in
a
web
just
about
everyone
in
avignon
was
there
to
witness
it
the
unhappy
creature
could
no
longer
sleep
at
nights
she
imagined
that
she
was
still
spinning
round
on
the
cradle
with
the
whole
town
below
laughing
at
her
then
her
mind
turned
to
the
despicable
tistet
védène
and
the
really
good
kicking
that
she
was
going
to
give
him
the
very
next
morning
oh
what
a
hell
of
a
kicking
that
was
going
to
be
the
dust
would
be
seen
flying
from
far
away
now
while
the
stable
was
being
prepared
for
her
what
do
you
think
our
tistet
védène
was
up
to
he
was
sailing
down
the
rhone
if
you
please
singing
on
a
papal
galley
on
his
way
to
the
court
at
naples
accompanying
the
troupe
of
young
nobles
who
were
sent
there
by
the
town
to
practice
their
diplomacy
and
good
manners
in
italy
tistet
was
no
nobleman
but
the
pope
insisted
on
rewarding
him
for
his
care
of
the
mule
particularly
for
the
part
he
had
just
played
in
her
rescue
so
it
was
the
mule
who
was
disappointed
the
next
day
oh
the
swine
he
has
got
wind
of
something
she
thought
shaking
her
bells
furiously
but
that
alright
go
away
if
you
must
you
you
will
still
get
your
kicking
when
you
get
back
i
will
save
it
for
you
and
save
it
for
him
she
did
after
tistet
departure
the
pope
mule
returned
to
her
tranquil
life
and
ways
of
the
old
times
no
more
quiquet
or
béluguet
in
the
stable
the
happy
days
of
wine
la
returned
and
with
them
came
contentment
long
siestas
and
even
the
chance
to
do
her
own
little
gavotte
once
again
when
she
went
le
pont
and
yet
since
her
adventure
she
felt
a
certain
coolness
towards
her
in
the
town
whispers
followed
her
on
her
way
old
folks
shook
their
heads
and
youngsters
laughed
and
pointed
at
the
bell
tower
even
the
good
pope
himself
had
as
much
confidence
in
his
furry
friend
and
when
he
wanted
a
nap
mounted
on
the
mule
coming
back
from
the
vineyard
on
sundays
he
feared
that
he
would
wake
up
on
top
of
the
bell
tower
the
mule
felt
all
this
but
suffered
it
in
silence
except
when
the
name
tistet
védène
was
mentioned
in
front
of
her
when
her
ears
would
twitch
and
she
would
snort
briefly
as
she
whetted
her
iron
shoes
on
the
paving
stones
seven
years
passed
before
tistet
védène
returned
from
the
court
at
naples
his
time
over
there
was
finished
but
he
had
heard
that
the
pope
head
had
suddenly
died
in
avignon
and
he
thought
the
position
was
a
good
one
so
he
rushed
to
join
the
line
of
applicants
when
the
scheming
védène
came
into
the
palace
he
had
grown
and
broadened
out
so
much
that
the
holy
father
hardly
recognised
him
it
has
to
be
admitted
though
that
the
pope
himself
had
aged
and
see
too
well
without
his
spectacles
tistet
was
one
to
be
intimidated
most
holy
father
can
you
not
recognise
me
it
is
i
tistet
védène
védène
yes
you
know
me
well
i
once
served
the
wine
la
to
your
mule
oh
yes
yes
i
remember
a
good
little
boy
tistet
védène
and
now
what
can
we
do
for
him
oh
not
a
lot
most
holy
father
i
came
to
ask
you
something
by
the
way
have
you
still
got
your
mule
is
she
keeping
well
oh
that
good
i
came
to
ask
you
for
the
position
of
your
head
who
has
just
died
head
you
you
far
too
young
how
old
are
you
now
twenty
years
and
two
months
great
pontiff
exactly
five
years
older
than
your
mule
oh
what
a
prize
of
god
a
fine
beast
if
you
only
knew
how
much
i
loved
that
mule
and
how
much
i
longed
for
her
in
italy
please
may
i
see
her
yes
my
child
you
may
see
her
said
the
good
and
by
now
very
moved
pope
and
as
you
care
so
much
for
the
dear
thing
i
do
want
you
to
live
too
far
away
from
this
day
forward
i
am
appointing
you
into
my
presence
in
the
office
of
head
my
cardinals
will
protest
but
so
what
i
quite
used
to
that
come
and
see
us
tomorrow
after
vespers
we
will
give
you
the
insignias
of
your
office
in
the
presence
of
our
chapter
and
then
i
take
you
to
see
the
mule
and
you
can
accompany
us
to
the
vineyard
well
well
let
do
it
i
need
tell
you
that
tistet
védène
left
the
hall
walking
on
air
and
could
wait
for
the
next
day
ceremony
and
yet
there
was
someone
in
the
palace
someone
even
happier
and
more
impatient
than
he
yes
it
was
the
mule
from
the
moment
védène
returned
right
until
the
next
day
vespers
the
fearsome
beast
never
stopped
stuffing
herself
with
hay
and
kicking
her
rear
hoofs
out
at
the
wall
she
too
was
making
her
own
special
preparations
for
the
ceremony
and
so
the
next
day
after
vespers
tistet
védène
made
his
entry
into
the
courtyard
of
the
papal
palace
all
the
head
clergymen
were
there
the
cardinals
in
red
robes
the
devil
advocate
in
black
velvet
the
convent
abbots
in
their
petite
mitres
the
church
wardens
of
and
the
purple
capes
of
the
choir
school
the
rank
and
file
clergy
were
also
there
the
papal
guard
in
full
dress
uniform
the
three
brotherhoods
of
penitentiaries
the
mount
ventoux
hermits
with
their
wild
looks
and
the
little
clerk
who
followed
them
carrying
his
bell
also
there
were
the
flagellant
brothers
naked
to
the
waist
the
sacristans
sprouting
judge
robes
and
all
and
sundry
even
the
dispensers
and
those
that
light
and
those
that
extinguish
the
candles
not
one
of
them
was
missing
it
was
a
great
ordination
bells
fireworks
sunshine
music
and
as
always
the
tambourine
playing
fanatics
leading
the
dance
over
there
le
pont
when
védène
appeared
in
the
midst
of
the
assembly
his
bearing
and
handsome
appearance
set
off
quite
a
murmur
of
approval
he
was
the
magnificent
type
of
a
man
from
provence
from
stock
with
curly
hair
and
a
small
wispy
beard
which
could
have
been
made
from
the
fine
metal
shavings
fallen
from
his
goldsmith
father
chisel
rumour
has
it
that
queen
jeanne
fingers
had
occasionally
toyed
with
that
blond
beard
the
majesty
of
védène
had
indeed
a
glorious
aspect
he
had
the
vain
distracted
look
of
men
who
have
been
loved
by
queens
on
that
day
as
a
courtesy
to
his
native
country
he
had
exchanged
his
neapolitan
clothes
for
a
pink
braided
jacket
in
the
provencal
style
and
a
huge
plume
from
an
ibis
on
the
camargue
fluttered
on
his
hood
the
moment
he
entered
as
the
new
head
he
gave
a
general
gentlemanly
greeting
and
made
his
way
towards
the
high
steps
where
the
pope
was
waiting
to
give
him
his
insignias
of
office
the
yellow
boxwood
spoon
and
the
saffron
uniform
the
mule
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
harnessed
and
ready
to
go
to
the
vineyard
as
he
passed
her
tistet
védène
gave
a
broad
smile
and
paused
to
give
her
two
or
three
friendly
pats
on
the
back
making
sure
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
that
the
pope
was
watching
the
mule
steadied
herself
there
you
are
caught
you
you
swine
i
have
saved
this
up
for
you
for
seven
long
years
and
she
let
loose
a
of
really
terrible
proportions
so
that
the
dust
from
it
was
seen
from
a
long
way
away
a
whirlwind
of
blond
haze
and
a
fluttering
ibis
feather
were
all
that
was
left
of
the
unfortunate
tistet
védène
mules
kicks
are
not
normally
of
such
lightning
speed
but
she
was
a
papal
mule
and
consider
this
she
had
held
it
back
for
seven
long
years
there
was
never
a
better
demonstration
of
an
ecclesiastical
grudge
the
lighthouse
on
the
it
was
one
of
those
nights
when
i
just
could
sleep
the
mistral
was
raging
and
kept
me
awake
till
morning
everything
creaked
on
the
windmill
the
whistling
sails
swayed
heavily
like
ship
tackle
in
the
wind
tiles
flew
wildly
off
the
roof
the
closely
packed
pines
covering
the
hillside
swayed
and
rustled
far
away
in
the
darkness
you
could
imagine
yourself
out
at
sea
all
this
reminded
me
of
the
bad
spell
of
insomnia
i
had
three
years
ago
when
i
lived
in
the
lighthouse
overlooking
the
entrance
to
the
gulf
of
ajaccio
on
the
corsican
coast
i
had
found
a
pleasant
place
there
where
i
could
muse
in
solitude
picture
an
island
with
a
reddish
cast
and
a
wild
appearance
there
was
a
lighthouse
on
one
headland
and
an
old
genoese
tower
on
the
other
which
housed
an
eagle
while
i
was
there
down
by
the
there
was
a
ruined
lazaretto
overgrown
with
grass
then
there
were
ravines
low
scrub
huge
rocks
wild
goats
and
corsican
ponies
trotting
about
their
manes
flowing
in
the
breeze
at
the
highest
point
surrounded
by
a
flurry
of
was
the
lighthouse
with
its
platform
of
white
masonry
where
the
keepers
paced
to
and
fro
there
was
a
green
arched
door
and
a
small
tower
on
top
of
which
a
great
multifaceted
lamp
reflected
the
sun
and
gave
light
even
in
the
daytime
well
what
i
recalled
of
the
isle
of
the
on
that
sleepless
night
as
i
listened
to
the
roaring
pines
it
was
on
this
enchanted
island
that
i
used
to
fulfil
my
need
for
the
open
air
and
solitude
before
i
found
my
windmill
what
did
i
do
with
myself
very
much
what
i
do
here
or
perhaps
even
less
when
the
mistral
or
tramontana
did
blow
too
hard
i
used
to
settle
down
between
two
rocks
down
by
the
sea
amongst
the
gulls
blackbirds
and
swallows
and
stayed
there
nearly
all
day
in
that
state
between
stupor
and
despondency
which
comes
from
contemplating
the
sea
have
you
ever
experienced
that
sweet
intoxication
of
the
soul
you
do
think
you
do
even
dream
your
whole
being
escapes
flies
away
expands
outwards
you
are
one
with
the
diving
seagull
the
light
spray
across
the
wave
tops
the
white
smoke
of
the
ship
disappearing
over
the
horizon
the
tiny
red
sailed
boat
here
and
there
a
pearl
of
water
a
patch
of
mist
anything
not
yourself
oh
what
delightful
hours
half
awake
and
i
have
spent
on
my
island
on
days
when
the
wind
was
really
up
and
it
was
too
rough
to
be
on
the
sea
shore
i
shut
myself
in
the
yard
of
the
lazaretto
it
was
a
small
melancholy
place
fragrant
with
rosemary
and
wild
absinth
nestling
against
part
of
the
old
wall
where
i
let
myself
be
gently
overcome
by
that
trace
of
relaxation
and
melancholy
which
drifts
in
with
the
sun
into
the
little
stone
lodges
open
all
round
like
old
tombs
occasionally
a
gate
would
swing
open
or
something
would
move
in
the
grass
once
it
was
a
goat
which
had
come
to
graze
and
shelter
from
the
wind
when
it
saw
me
it
stopped
dumfounded
and
froze
all
agog
horns
skyward
looking
at
me
with
innocent
eyes
at
about
five
the
lighthouse
keepers
megaphone
summoned
me
to
dinner
i
returned
only
slowly
towards
the
lighthouse
taking
a
small
pathway
through
the
scrub
which
ran
up
a
hilltop
overlooking
the
sea
at
every
step
i
glanced
backwards
onto
the
immense
expanse
of
water
and
light
that
seemed
to
increase
as
i
went
higher
it
was
truly
delightful
at
the
top
i
can
still
recall
now
the
lovely
dining
room
with
large
flagstones
the
bouillabaisse
steaming
inside
and
the
door
wide
open
to
the
white
terrace
all
lit
up
by
the
setting
sun
the
keepers
were
already
there
waiting
for
me
before
settling
themselves
down
to
eat
there
were
three
of
them
a
man
from
marseilles
and
two
corsicans
they
all
looked
alike
small
and
bearded
with
tanned
cracked
faces
and
the
same
jacket
but
they
had
completely
different
ways
and
temperaments
you
could
immediately
sense
the
difference
in
the
two
races
by
their
conduct
the
marseillais
industrious
and
lively
always
busy
always
on
the
move
going
round
the
island
from
morning
till
night
gardening
fishing
or
collecting
gulls
eggs
he
would
lie
in
wait
in
the
scrub
to
catch
a
passing
goat
to
milk
and
there
was
always
some
garlic
mayonnaise
or
bouillabaisse
on
the
hob
the
corsicans
however
did
absolutely
nothing
over
and
above
their
duties
they
regarded
themselves
as
civil
servants
and
spent
whole
days
in
the
kitchen
playing
cards
only
pausing
to
perform
the
ritualistic
relighting
of
their
pipes
or
using
scissors
to
cut
up
large
wads
of
green
tobacco
in
their
palms
otherwise
all
three
marseillais
and
corsicans
were
good
simple
folk
and
were
full
of
consideration
for
their
visitor
although
i
must
have
seemed
a
very
queer
fish
to
them
the
thought
of
someone
coming
to
stay
in
the
lighthouse
for
pleasure
was
beyond
their
grasp
these
were
men
who
found
the
days
interminably
long
and
were
ecstatic
when
their
turn
came
to
go
ashore
in
the
warm
season
this
great
relief
came
every
month
ten
days
off
after
thirty
days
on
that
was
the
rule
in
the
winter
though
in
rough
weather
no
rules
could
be
enforced
the
wind
blew
strongly
the
waves
ran
high
the
were
shrouded
in
white
sea
spray
and
they
were
cut
off
for
two
or
three
months
at
a
time
sometimes
in
terrible
conditions
i
tell
you
what
happened
to
me
monsieur
old
bartoli
told
me
one
day
while
we
were
eating
it
was
five
years
ago
at
this
very
table
one
winter
evening
just
like
this
one
that
night
there
were
just
the
two
of
us
me
and
a
fellow
keeper
called
tchéco
the
others
were
ashore
or
sick
or
else
on
leave
i
ca
remember
now
we
were
finishing
our
dinners
quite
contentedly
suddenly
my
fellow
keeper
stopped
eating
looked
at
me
with
strange
eyes
and
fell
forward
onto
the
table
with
outstretched
arms
i
went
to
him
i
shook
him
i
called
his
name
hey
tché
hey
tché
no
response
he
was
dead
you
ca
imagine
how
i
felt
i
stayed
there
and
trembling
next
to
the
body
for
more
than
an
hour
then
suddenly
i
remembered
the
light
i
only
just
had
time
to
climb
up
to
light
the
lantern
it
was
already
getting
dark
what
a
night
monsieur
the
sea
and
the
wind
they
just
did
sound
like
they
usually
do
all
the
time
somebody
seemed
to
be
calling
to
me
from
down
the
stairway
i
became
frenzied
my
mouth
dried
but
you
could
have
made
me
go
down
there
again
oh
no
i
was
too
scared
of
the
dead
body
however
in
the
small
hours
some
of
my
courage
returned
i
went
down
and
carried
my
mate
back
to
his
bed
covered
him
over
with
a
sheet
said
a
short
prayer
and
then
ran
to
raise
the
alarm
unfortunately
the
sea
was
too
heavy
i
shouted
as
loudly
as
i
could
again
and
again
but
to
no
avail
nobody
came
so
i
was
alone
in
the
lighthouse
with
poor
tchéco
and
for
god
knows
how
long
i
was
hoping
to
be
able
to
keep
him
close
to
me
until
the
boat
came
but
after
three
days
that
became
impossible
what
should
i
have
done
carried
him
outside
buried
him
the
rock
was
too
hard
and
there
are
murders
of
crows
on
the
island
it
was
a
shame
to
leave
a
christian
to
them
and
then
i
decided
to
take
him
down
to
one
of
the
lodges
in
the
lazaretto
that
sad
duty
lasted
a
whole
afternoon
and
yes
it
took
some
courage
look
here
monsieur
even
today
when
i
go
down
to
that
part
of
the
island
through
an
afternoon
gale
i
feel
that
the
dead
man
is
still
there
on
my
shoulders
poor
old
bartoli
sweat
ran
down
his
forehead
just
thinking
about
it
and
so
our
meals
passed
in
long
conversations
about
the
lighthouse
and
the
sea
with
tales
of
shipwrecks
and
corsican
bandits
then
as
night
fell
the
keeper
of
the
first
watch
lit
his
took
his
pipe
flask
and
a
thick
volume
of
plutarch
which
was
the
sum
total
of
the
library
and
went
down
out
of
sight
a
moment
later
there
was
a
crash
of
chains
pulleys
and
heavy
weights
as
the
clock
was
wound
up
while
this
was
going
on
i
went
to
sit
outside
on
the
terrace
the
sun
already
well
down
hurried
its
descent
into
the
water
dragging
the
whole
skyline
with
it
the
wind
freshened
the
island
turned
violet
in
the
sky
a
big
bird
passed
slowly
near
me
it
was
the
eagle
homing
to
the
genoese
tower
gradually
a
sea
mist
got
up
soon
nothing
could
be
seen
except
a
white
ridge
of
around
the
island
suddenly
a
great
flood
of
light
emerged
above
my
head
from
the
lighthouse
the
clear
ray
left
the
island
in
complete
darkness
as
it
fell
far
out
to
sea
and
i
too
was
lost
to
sight
in
the
night
under
the
great
luminous
sweeps
which
barely
caught
me
as
they
passed
but
the
wind
was
freshening
again
time
to
go
indoors
i
groped
to
close
the
huge
door
i
secured
the
iron
bars
and
then
still
feeling
my
way
took
the
small
stairs
which
trembled
and
rang
under
my
feet
to
the
top
of
the
lighthouse
here
as
you
can
imagine
there
was
plenty
of
light
picture
a
gigantic
lamp
with
six
rows
of
wicks
with
the
inner
facets
of
the
lantern
arranged
around
them
some
with
an
enormous
crystal
glass
lens
others
opened
onto
a
large
fixed
glass
panel
which
protected
the
flame
from
the
wind
when
i
came
in
i
was
completely
dazzled
and
the
coppers
tins
white
metal
reflectors
rotating
walls
of
convex
crystal
glass
with
large
circles
and
all
the
flickering
lights
gave
me
a
touch
of
vertigo
however
gradually
my
eyes
got
used
to
it
and
i
settled
down
at
the
foot
of
the
lamp
beside
the
keeper
who
was
reading
his
plutarch
for
fear
of
falling
asleep
outside
all
was
dark
and
desperate
on
the
small
turning
balcony
a
maddening
gust
of
wind
howled
the
lighthouse
creaked
the
sea
roared
out
on
the
point
the
breakers
on
the
shoals
sounded
like
cannon
shots
at
times
an
invisible
finger
tapped
at
the
panes
it
was
some
bird
of
the
night
drawn
by
the
light
braining
itself
against
the
glass
inside
the
sparkling
hot
lantern
nothing
was
heard
except
the
crackling
flame
the
dripping
oil
the
chain
unwinding
and
the
monotonous
intoning
of
the
life
of
demetrius
of
phaleron
at
midnight
the
keeper
stood
up
took
a
last
peek
at
the
wicks
and
we
went
below
we
passed
the
keeper
of
the
second
watch
rubbing
his
eyes
as
he
came
up
we
gave
him
the
flask
and
the
petrarch
then
before
retiring
we
briefly
entered
the
below
which
was
full
of
chains
heavy
weights
metal
tanks
and
rope
by
the
light
of
his
small
lamp
the
keeper
wrote
in
the
large
lighthouse
log
always
left
open
at
the
last
entry
heavy
seas
tempest
ship
at
the
wreck
of
the
the
other
night
the
mistral
took
us
off
course
to
the
corsican
coast
so
to
speak
let
stay
there
as
it
were
while
i
tell
you
of
an
horrific
event
often
talked
about
by
the
local
fishermen
during
their
evening
the
details
of
which
came
to
me
by
chance
about
two
or
three
years
ago
i
was
out
sailing
on
the
sardinian
sea
with
seven
or
eight
customs
men
a
tough
trip
for
a
landlubber
there
had
been
a
single
fair
day
in
the
whole
of
march
the
wind
relentlessly
pursued
us
and
the
sea
never
ever
let
up
one
evening
as
we
were
running
before
the
storm
our
boat
found
refuge
in
the
opening
to
the
straits
of
bonifacio
in
the
midst
of
an
archipelago
they
were
not
a
welcoming
sight
huge
bare
rocks
covered
with
birds
a
few
clumps
of
absinth
some
lenticular
scrub
and
here
and
there
pieces
of
rotting
wood
half
buried
in
the
silt
but
believe
me
for
a
night
stay
these
ominous
rocks
were
a
much
better
prospect
than
the
deckhouse
of
our
old
boat
where
the
waves
made
themselves
very
much
at
home
in
fact
we
were
pleased
to
see
the
islands
the
crew
had
lit
a
fire
for
the
bouillabaisse
by
the
time
we
were
all
ashore
the
master
hailed
me
and
pointed
out
a
small
outcrop
of
white
masonry
almost
lost
in
the
fog
at
the
far
end
of
the
island
are
you
coming
to
the
cemetery
he
said
a
cemetery
master
lionetti
where
are
we
then
the
lavezzi
islands
monsieur
the
six
hundred
souls
from
the
are
buried
here
at
the
very
spot
where
their
frigate
foundered
ten
years
ago
poor
souls
they
do
get
many
visitors
the
least
we
can
do
is
to
go
and
say
hello
to
them
while
we
here
of
course
willingly
skipper
the
crew
last
resting
place
was
inexpressibly
gloomy
i
can
still
see
its
small
low
wall
it
iron
gate
rusted
and
hard
to
open
its
silent
chapel
and
hundreds
of
crosses
overgrown
by
the
grass
not
a
single
everlasting
wreath
not
one
remembrance
nothing
oh
the
poor
deserted
dead
how
cold
they
must
be
in
their
unwanted
graves
we
stayed
there
briefly
kneeling
down
the
master
was
praying
loudly
while
gulls
sole
guardians
of
the
cemetery
circled
over
our
heads
their
harsh
melancholy
cries
counterpoint
to
the
sea
lamentations
the
prayer
finished
we
plodded
sadly
back
to
the
spot
where
the
boat
was
moored
the
sailors
had
not
wasted
any
time
we
were
met
by
a
great
roaring
fire
in
the
shelter
of
a
rock
with
a
steaming
we
all
sat
around
feet
drying
by
the
flames
and
soon
everyone
had
two
slices
of
rye
bread
to
dunk
into
a
terra
cotta
bowl
on
our
knees
the
meal
was
eaten
in
silence
after
all
we
were
wet
and
hungry
and
near
to
the
cemetery
however
once
the
bowls
were
empty
we
lit
our
pipes
and
started
to
speak
about
the
well
how
did
it
happen
i
asked
the
boat
captain
who
was
looking
thoughtfully
into
the
flames
head
in
hands
how
did
it
happen
captain
lionetti
repeated
by
way
of
a
reply
then
he
sighed
alas
monsieur
nobody
alive
can
tell
you
all
we
know
is
that
the
loaded
with
troops
bound
for
the
crimea
had
left
toulon
in
bad
weather
the
previous
night
later
things
changed
for
the
worse
wind
rain
and
enormous
seas
the
like
of
which
had
never
been
seen
before
in
the
morning
the
wind
moderated
but
the
sea
was
still
in
a
frenzy
on
top
of
that
the
devil
own
fog
descended
you
could
see
a
light
at
four
paces
those
fogs
monsieur
you
ca
believe
how
treacherous
they
can
be
but
it
did
make
any
difference
i
believe
the
must
have
lost
her
rudder
that
morning
for
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
fog
and
the
captain
should
never
have
gone
aground
there
he
was
a
tough
and
experienced
seafarer
as
we
all
know
he
had
commanded
the
naval
station
in
corsica
for
three
years
and
knew
his
coast
hereabouts
as
well
as
i
and
it
all
i
do
know
at
what
time
do
you
think
the
foundered
it
must
have
been
at
midday
yes
monsieur
right
in
the
middle
of
the
day
but
my
word
when
it
comes
to
sea
fogs
midday
is
no
better
than
a
night
a
local
customs
officer
told
me
that
at
about
half
past
eleven
that
day
as
he
went
outside
to
close
his
shutters
the
wind
got
up
again
and
a
gust
blew
his
cap
off
at
the
risk
of
being
carried
away
himself
he
began
to
scramble
after
it
along
the
shore
on
his
hands
and
knees
you
must
understand
that
men
are
not
well
off
and
a
cap
is
an
expensive
item
it
seems
that
our
man
raised
his
head
for
a
second
and
noticed
a
big
ship
under
bare
poles
running
before
the
wind
blowing
towards
the
lavezzi
islands
this
ship
was
coming
fast
so
fast
that
he
hardly
had
time
to
get
a
good
look
at
her
no
doubt
it
was
the
because
half
an
hour
later
the
island
shepherd
heard
something
on
these
rocks
but
here
the
very
shepherd
i
talking
about
monsieur
he
will
tell
you
himself
good
day
palombo
do
be
frightened
come
and
warm
yourself
a
hooded
man
whom
i
had
seen
a
moment
ago
hanging
around
our
fire
came
timidly
towards
us
i
had
thought
he
was
one
of
the
crew
not
knowing
that
there
was
a
shepherd
on
the
island
he
was
an
old
leprous
person
not
quite
all
there
and
affected
by
some
awful
disease
or
other
which
gave
him
obscenely
thickened
lips
horrible
to
look
at
we
took
great
trouble
to
tell
him
what
it
was
all
about
then
scratching
his
diseased
lip
the
old
man
told
us
that
yes
indeed
from
inside
his
hut
he
had
heard
a
fearful
crash
on
the
rocks
at
midday
on
that
day
the
island
was
completely
flooded
so
he
could
go
and
it
was
until
the
next
day
that
he
opened
up
to
see
the
shore
covered
in
debris
and
bodies
washed
up
by
the
sea
horrified
he
ran
to
his
boat
to
try
to
get
some
help
from
bonifacio
the
shepherd
was
tired
by
all
this
talking
and
sat
down
and
the
master
took
up
the
story
yes
monsieur
this
was
the
unfortunate
old
man
that
came
to
raise
the
alarm
he
was
almost
insane
with
fear
and
from
that
day
on
his
mind
has
been
deranged
the
truth
is
the
catastrophe
was
enough
to
do
it
imagine
six
hundred
bodies
piled
up
haphazardly
on
the
beach
with
splinters
of
wood
and
shreds
of
poor
the
sea
had
crushed
everything
to
such
tiny
fragments
that
the
shepherd
palombo
could
find
enough
good
timber
to
make
a
fence
round
his
hut
as
for
the
men
practically
all
of
them
were
disfigured
and
hideously
mutilated
it
was
pitiful
to
see
them
all
tangled
up
together
we
found
the
captain
in
full
dress
uniform
and
the
chaplain
with
his
stole
round
his
neck
in
one
place
between
two
rocks
lay
the
ship
young
apprentice
he
looked
as
though
he
was
still
alive
but
he
was
it
was
fated
no
one
could
have
survived
here
the
master
broke
off
his
tale
hey
nardi
he
cried
the
fire
going
out
nardi
threw
two
or
three
pieces
of
tarred
planking
onto
the
embers
which
spluttered
and
then
blazed
lionetti
continued
the
saddest
thing
about
this
story
is
this
three
weeks
before
the
disaster
a
small
corvette
similar
to
the
on
its
way
to
the
crimea
was
also
wrecked
in
the
same
way
almost
at
the
same
place
this
time
however
we
managed
to
save
the
crew
and
twenty
soldiers
in
transit
who
were
on
board
these
unfortunate
soldiers
you
see
were
not
able
to
go
about
their
business
we
took
them
to
bonifacio
and
they
stayed
with
us
at
the
port
for
two
days
once
they
were
thoroughly
dried
out
and
back
on
their
feet
we
bade
them
farewell
and
good
luck
and
they
returned
to
toulon
where
they
later
set
sail
once
again
for
the
crimea
it
not
too
difficult
to
guess
which
ship
they
sailed
on
yes
monsieur
it
was
the
we
found
all
twenty
of
them
amongst
the
dead
just
where
we
are
now
i
myself
recovered
a
good
looking
brigadier
with
fine
whiskers
a
man
from
paris
whom
i
had
put
up
at
my
house
and
who
had
made
us
laugh
continuously
with
his
tales
to
see
him
there
was
heart
breaking
oh
holy
mother
of
god
with
that
lionetti
deeply
moved
knocked
out
his
pipe
and
tottered
off
to
his
cabin
wishing
me
goodnight
the
sailors
spoke
quietly
to
each
other
for
a
while
then
they
put
out
their
pipes
one
by
one
nothing
more
was
said
the
old
shepherd
went
off
and
i
remained
alone
to
mull
things
over
sitting
amongst
the
sleeping
crew
still
affected
by
the
horrendous
tale
i
had
just
heard
i
tried
to
reconstruct
in
my
mind
the
unfortunate
lost
ship
and
the
story
of
the
agonising
event
witnessed
only
by
the
gulls
a
few
details
struck
me
and
helped
me
to
fill
out
all
the
twists
and
turns
of
the
drama
the
captain
in
full
dress
uniform
the
chaplain
stole
the
twenty
soldiers
in
transit
i
visualised
the
frigate
leaving
toulon
at
night
as
she
left
the
port
the
sea
was
up
the
wind
was
terrible
but
the
captain
was
a
valiant
and
experienced
sailor
and
everybody
on
board
was
relaxed
a
fog
got
up
in
the
morning
a
sense
of
unease
began
to
spread
the
whole
crew
were
on
deck
the
captain
stayed
on
the
in
the
where
the
soldiers
were
billeted
it
was
pitch
black
and
the
air
was
hot
some
of
the
men
were
the
ship
pitched
horribly
which
made
it
impossible
to
stand
up
they
talked
in
groups
sitting
on
the
floor
clutching
the
benches
for
dear
life
they
had
to
shout
to
be
heard
some
of
them
started
to
feel
afraid
listen
shipwrecks
are
common
around
those
parts
the
soldiers
were
there
themselves
to
prove
it
and
what
they
said
was
not
at
all
reassuring
especially
the
brigadier
a
parisian
who
was
always
making
quips
that
made
your
flesh
creep
a
shipwreck
how
hilarious
a
shipwreck
we
are
about
to
leave
for
an
icy
bath
and
then
be
taken
to
captain
lionetti
place
in
bonifacio
where
blackbirds
are
on
the
menu
the
soldiers
laughed
suddenly
there
was
a
great
creaking
sound
what
the
hell
that
what
going
on
we
just
lost
the
rudder
said
a
thoroughly
sailor
who
was
running
through
the
have
a
good
trip
cried
the
brigadier
but
this
time
the
remark
caused
no
laughter
there
was
chaos
on
deck
but
everything
was
hidden
by
the
fog
the
sailors
were
all
over
the
place
scared
and
groping
about
no
rudder
changing
course
was
impossible
the
could
only
run
before
the
wind
it
was
at
that
moment
that
the
customs
officer
saw
her
it
was
half
past
eleven
in
front
of
the
frigate
a
sound
like
a
cannon
shot
was
heard
the
breakers
the
breakers
it
was
all
up
there
was
no
hope
ship
and
men
together
were
going
straight
onto
a
lee
shore
the
captain
went
down
into
his
cabin
after
a
short
time
he
reappeared
on
the
in
full
dress
uniform
he
wanted
to
look
right
when
he
died
in
the
the
soldiers
were
anxiously
exchanged
glances
without
saying
a
word
the
sick
were
doing
their
best
to
get
on
their
feet
even
the
brigadier
was
laughing
any
more
it
was
then
that
the
door
opened
and
the
chaplain
appeared
on
the
threshold
wearing
his
stole
kneel
down
my
children
those
who
could
obeyed
and
in
a
resounding
voice
the
priest
began
the
prayer
for
the
dying
suddenly
there
was
a
formidable
impact
a
cry
one
cry
consisting
of
many
an
immense
cry
their
arms
fully
tensed
their
hands
all
clasped
together
their
shocked
faces
looking
at
a
vision
of
death
as
it
passed
before
them
like
a
stroke
of
lightning
mercy
that
is
how
i
spent
the
whole
night
ten
years
after
the
event
reliving
and
evoking
the
spirit
of
the
ship
whose
wreckage
was
all
around
me
far
away
in
the
straits
the
storm
was
still
raging
on
the
flame
was
blown
flat
by
a
gust
of
wind
and
i
could
hear
our
boat
bobbing
listlessly
about
at
the
foot
of
the
rocks
its
mooring
squealing
the
customs
men
the
boat
from
on
which
i
had
made
the
mournful
voyage
to
the
lavezzi
islands
was
a
small
old
vessel
with
no
shelter
available
from
the
wind
the
waves
nor
even
the
rain
save
in
a
small
tar
covered
deckhouse
hardly
big
enough
for
a
table
and
two
bunks
it
was
unbelievable
what
the
sailors
had
to
put
up
with
in
bad
weather
their
faces
were
streaming
and
their
soaked
tunics
steaming
as
if
in
the
wash
in
the
depths
of
winter
these
unfortunate
souls
spent
whole
days
like
this
crouching
on
their
drenched
seats
shivering
in
the
unhealthy
wet
and
cold
even
at
nights
obviously
a
fire
could
be
lit
on
board
and
it
was
often
difficult
to
make
the
shore
well
not
one
of
these
men
complained
i
always
saw
the
same
calmness
and
good
humour
in
them
even
in
the
most
severe
weather
and
yet
what
a
gloomy
life
these
mariners
led
they
were
months
away
from
going
home
tacking
and
reaching
around
those
dangerous
coasts
for
nourishment
they
had
to
make
do
mainly
with
mouldy
bread
and
wild
onions
they
never
once
tasted
wine
or
meat
these
were
expensive
items
and
they
only
earned
five
hundred
francs
a
year
yes
five
hundred
francs
a
year
but
it
did
seem
to
bother
them
everybody
there
seemed
somehow
content
aft
of
the
deckhouse
there
was
a
tub
full
of
rain
water
for
the
crew
to
drink
and
i
recall
that
after
the
final
gulp
went
down
every
last
one
of
them
would
finish
off
his
mug
with
a
satisfied
ah
a
comic
yet
endearing
indication
of
all
being
well
with
him
palombo
a
small
tanned
man
from
bonifacio
was
the
merriest
and
the
most
well
at
ease
of
all
of
them
he
was
always
singing
even
in
the
very
worst
weather
when
the
seas
were
high
when
the
sky
was
overcast
dark
and
hail
filled
everyone
was
all
agog
sniffing
the
air
their
hands
cupped
over
their
ears
listening
and
watching
out
for
the
next
squall
even
in
this
great
silence
of
anxiety
on
board
the
voice
of
palombo
would
begin
the
refrain
no
dear
sir
it
will
cause
a
stir
wise
lisette
will
stay
and
never
ever
go
away
and
the
gust
could
blow
rattle
the
tackle
shake
and
flood
the
boat
still
the
customs
man
song
continued
rocking
like
a
seagull
on
the
crests
of
the
waves
sometimes
the
wind
accompaniment
was
too
loud
and
the
words
were
drowned
but
between
each
breaking
wave
in
the
cascade
of
draining
water
the
little
ditty
was
heard
once
again
wise
lisette
will
stay
and
never
ever
go
away
one
day
when
it
was
blowing
and
raining
hard
i
did
hear
him
this
was
so
unusual
that
i
was
moved
to
emerge
through
the
boathouse
hatch
and
shout
hey
palombo
you
not
singing
then
palombo
did
reply
he
was
lying
apparently
motionless
under
his
bench
i
went
up
to
him
his
teeth
were
chattering
and
his
whole
body
was
trembling
feverishly
he
got
a
pountoura
his
comrades
miserably
informed
me
this
was
what
they
called
a
stitch
in
the
side
pleurisy
i
had
never
witnessed
a
more
miserable
sight
there
was
an
overwhelming
leaden
sky
the
boat
had
water
cascading
everywhere
the
luckless
fevered
man
was
wrapped
in
an
old
rubber
coat
which
glistened
like
a
seal
skin
the
cold
the
wind
and
the
jolting
of
the
waves
soon
made
his
condition
worse
he
became
delirious
something
had
to
be
done
after
doing
all
we
could
and
as
evening
was
approaching
we
put
into
a
small
silent
lifeless
port
only
animated
by
circling
seagulls
the
beach
was
shut
in
by
high
rocks
impassable
scrub
and
sombre
unseasonably
green
shrubs
nearby
close
to
the
sea
there
was
a
custom
post
housed
in
a
small
white
building
with
grey
shutters
it
was
given
a
rather
sinister
air
this
official
outpost
numbered
like
the
cap
on
a
uniform
by
its
position
in
the
middle
of
such
a
deserted
spot
we
took
the
ailing
palombo
down
to
it
though
it
was
a
despairing
sanctuary
for
a
sick
man
we
found
the
custom
man
eating
by
the
fireside
with
his
wife
and
children
everybody
had
a
gaunt
and
jaundiced
look
and
they
were
and
feverish
the
young
mother
suckling
a
baby
shivered
as
she
spoke
to
us
it
a
terrible
post
the
inspector
barely
whispered
to
me
we
have
to
replace
our
customs
men
here
every
two
years
the
marsh
fever
eats
them
away
nevertheless
the
main
thing
was
to
get
hold
of
a
doctor
there
one
this
side
of
sartène
many
kilometres
away
what
could
we
do
our
mariners
were
done
and
could
do
no
more
and
it
was
too
far
to
send
one
of
the
children
then
the
woman
leaning
outdoors
called
cecco
cecco
and
in
came
a
large
chap
a
typical
specimen
of
a
poacher
or
corsican
bandit
with
his
brown
wool
cap
and
his
goatskin
sailors
jacket
i
had
already
noticed
him
as
we
disembarked
he
was
sitting
in
front
of
the
door
chewing
his
red
pipe
with
a
rifle
between
his
legs
he
made
off
as
we
came
near
i
do
know
why
perhaps
he
thought
we
had
gendarmes
with
us
when
he
entered
the
customs
woman
blushed
he
my
cousin
she
told
us
there
no
danger
that
this
one
will
get
lost
in
the
corsican
scrub
then
she
whispered
something
to
him
indicating
the
sick
man
the
man
bent
forward
but
said
nothing
then
he
left
whistled
his
dog
and
was
gone
leaping
from
rock
to
rock
with
his
long
legs
with
the
rifle
on
his
shoulder
the
children
who
seemed
terrified
by
the
inspector
quickly
scoffed
down
their
dinner
of
chestnuts
and
white
corsican
goat
cheese
then
there
was
the
inevitable
water
never
anything
but
water
on
the
table
and
yet
a
sip
of
wine
would
have
really
done
the
children
some
good
oh
what
complete
and
utter
misery
after
a
while
their
mother
saw
them
off
to
bed
while
their
father
lit
his
lantern
and
went
out
to
check
the
coast
we
stayed
by
the
fireside
looking
after
the
invalid
who
was
tossing
and
turning
on
his
pallet
as
if
he
was
still
at
sea
being
buffeted
by
the
waves
we
warmed
up
some
stones
to
put
on
his
side
to
ease
his
pleurisy
once
or
twice
the
hapless
man
recognised
me
as
i
approached
his
bed
and
put
out
his
hand
with
great
difficulty
by
way
of
thanks
his
broad
hand
was
as
rough
and
hot
as
one
of
the
bricks
from
the
fire
it
was
a
miserable
vigil
outside
as
night
fell
the
bad
weather
picked
up
again
and
there
was
a
crash
a
rumble
and
a
great
spurt
of
spray
as
the
battle
between
rocks
and
water
broke
out
again
from
time
to
time
the
gusts
from
out
at
sea
blew
into
the
bay
and
enveloped
the
house
the
flames
suddenly
flared
and
lit
up
the
blank
faces
of
the
sailors
around
the
fireplace
they
had
the
calm
expression
of
those
who
routinely
experience
wide
open
spaces
and
horizons
occasionally
palombo
moaned
gently
and
their
eyes
would
turn
towards
the
wretched
place
where
the
poor
man
was
dying
far
from
home
and
beyond
help
only
their
breathing
and
sighing
could
be
heard
this
was
the
only
reaction
you
would
get
out
of
these
workmen
of
the
sea
who
were
just
as
patient
and
accepting
of
their
own
misfortune
no
rebellions
no
strikes
only
sighs
just
sighs
and
yet
perhaps
i
kidding
myself
one
of
them
on
his
way
to
putting
wood
on
the
fire
whispered
almost
apologetically
to
me
you
see
monsieur
there
can
be
much
suffering
in
our
line
of
work
the
cucugnanian
priest
every
year
at
the
feast
of
the
presentation
of
jesus
the
provencal
poets
publish
a
wonderful
little
book
overflowing
with
beautiful
verse
and
great
stories
i
only
just
received
this
year
copy
and
inside
i
found
this
adorable
little
fable
which
i
am
going
to
try
to
translate
for
you
albeit
in
a
slightly
abridged
version
men
of
paris
prepare
yourselves
for
a
treat
the
finest
flowering
of
provencal
flour
is
to
be
laid
before
you
right
now
father
martin
was
the
cucugnan
priest
he
was
as
wholesome
as
fresh
bread
as
good
as
gold
and
he
had
a
paternal
love
for
his
cucugnanians
for
him
cucugnan
would
have
been
the
nearest
thing
to
paradise
on
earth
if
only
the
people
had
given
him
a
little
more
shall
we
say
business
but
sadly
his
confessional
remained
unused
except
as
a
larder
for
spiders
on
easter
day
the
hosts
remained
secure
in
their
holy
ciborium
it
hurt
the
good
priest
to
the
very
centre
of
his
soul
and
every
day
he
prayed
that
he
would
live
to
see
his
missing
flock
back
in
the
fold
well
as
you
will
see
the
good
lord
was
listening
one
sunday
after
the
gospels
monsieur
martin
took
his
place
in
the
pulpit
bretheren
he
said
believe
me
or
believe
me
not
the
other
night
i
found
myself
yes

miserable
sinner
at
the
very
gates
of
paradise
i
knocked
peter

turning

right
hand
side

be
opened
unto

i
kept
on

on
going

was
dead

and
covered
in
goose
flesh
there
was
nothing
to
take
my
mind
off
things
a
small
footpath
full
of
brambles
and
shining
rubies
and
hissing
snakes
led
me
to
the
silver
door
i
knocked
who
is
it
asked
a
hoarse
deathly
the
priest
of
of
of
ah
come
in
i
entered
a
great
beautiful
angel
with
wings
as
dark
as
the
night
a
robe
as
radiant
as
the
day
and
a
diamond
key
hanging
at
his
waist
was
scratching
something
into
a
great
book
even
thicker
than
well
what
do
you
want
do
you
have
a
question
said
the
dear
angel
of
the
lord

would
like

at
your
service
monsieur
angel
cucugnan

say
the
angel
then
opened
his
great
book
and
leafed
through
it
licking
his
finger
to
turn
the
page
cucugnan
he
gave
a
long
sigh
monsieur
martin

have
no
one
here
in
purgatory
from
jesus
mary
and
joseph

one

cucugnan

possibly

my
poor
monsieur
martin
as
you
want
to
be
sure
about
all
this
no
matter
what
and
to
see
for
yourself
what
you
have
to
do
to
turn
things
round
take
that
footpath
and
run
along
it
if
you
know
how
to
run
you
will
come
across
a
large
gate
on
the
left
there
it
will
all
be
made
clear
to
you
and
by
god
himself
and
the
angel
closed
the
door
it
was
a
long
pathway
covered
in
embers
i
staggered
as
if
i
had
been
drinking
i
stumbled
at
every
single
step
i
was
covered
in
sweat
a
drop
on
every
single
hair
of
my
body
and
i
was
gasping
for
something
to
drink
but
thanks
to
the
sandals
peter
lent
me
i
did
burn
my
feet
after
stumbling
and
limping
along
for
some
time
i
saw
a
door
on
the
left
no
it
was
more
a
gate
an
enormous
yawning
gate
like
a
huge
oven
door
what
a
fantastic
sight
my
children
no
one
asked
my
name
even
there
at
the
reception
area
i
went
through
the
cavernous
door
in
batches
my
brothers
just
like
you
sinners
as
you
go
to
the
cabaret
on
sunday
night
i
was
sweating
profusely
and
yet
frozen
to
the
spot
i
was
trembling
fearfully
my
hair
stood
on
end
i
smelt
burning
roasting
flesh
something
like
the
smell
that
spread
around
cucugnan
when
eli
the
marshal
burned
the
hoof
of
an
old
ass
while
shoeing
it
i
breathe
in
that
foetid
burning
air
i
heard
a
frightful
clamour
there
was
moaning
howling
you
there
are
you
coming
in
or
are
you
staying
outside
scorned
a
horned
devil
prodding
me
with
his
me
i
not
going
in
i
am
a
friend
of
almighty
so
you
a
friend
of
god
eh
you
damned
fool
what
are
you
doing
here
i
have
come
oh
do
bother
me
i
can
hardly
stand
up
i
have
come
i
have
come
from
a
far
away
to
humbly
ask
if
if
by
any
chance
you
have
someone
here
from
cucugnan
oh
god
teeth
you
playing
the
idiot
you
it
as
though
you
did
know
that
the
whole
of
cucugnan
is
here
well
ugly
crow
watch
and
you
will
see
how
things
are
here
with
your
precious
cucugnanians
and
i
saw
in
the
middle
of
a
terrible
flaming
vortex
of
flame
the
lanky
you
all
knew
him
my
brothers
who
was
regularly
drunk
and
so
often
knocked
ten
bells
out
of
his
poor
clairon
i
saw
catarinet
that
little
vixen
with
her
nose
in
the
air
who
slept
in
the
barn
you
remember
that
you
rascals
but
let
move
on
i
said
too
much
already
i
saw
pascal
who
made
his
olive
oil
with
monsieur
julien
olives
i
saw
babet
the
gleaner
who
as
she
gleaned
grabbed
handfuls
from
the
stacks
to
make
up
her
quota
i
saw
master
grapasi
who
oiled
his
wheelbarrow
rather
a
lot
so
as
not
to
be
heard
and
dauphine
who
greatly
overcharged
for
water
from
her
wells
and
le
tortillard
who
when
he
met
me
carrying
the
good
lord
rushed
away
with
his
biretta
perched
on
his
head
and
his
pipe
stuck
in
his
mouth
as
proud
as
lucifer
as
though
he
had
come
across
a
mangy
dog
and
coulau
with
his
zette
and
jacques
and
pierre
and
toni
much
moved
and
ashen
with
fear
the
congregation
whimpered
while
imagining
their
fathers
and
their
mothers
and
their
grandmothers
and
their
sisters
when
hell
gates
were
opened
your
feelings
do
deceive
you
brothers
the
good
abbot
continued
you

that
this
ca

on
i
am
responsible
for
your
souls
and
i
do
want
to
save
you
from
the
abyss
towards
which
you
are
rushing
and
head
first
tomorrow
at
the
latest
my
task
begins
and
the
work
will
not
be
in
vain
this
is
how
i
am
going
to
go
about
it
for
it
to
come
out
well
everything
must
be
done
in
an
orderly
way
we
will
proceed
step
by
step
like
at
jonquières
when
there

dance

will
give
confession
to
the
old
men
and
women

long
time

short

the
women
i
will
tell
them
not
to

up
their
parts

miller

day

be
enough
for
him
and
if
we
finished
by
sunday
we
have
done
very
well
look
my
children
when
wheat
is
ripe
it
must
be
harvested
when
the
wine
is
drawn
it
must
be
drunk
we
had
enough
of
dirty
washing
what
matters
now
is
to
wash
it
and
to
wash
it
well
may
you
all
receive
god
loving
grace
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
the
washing
was
duly
done
from
that
memorable
sunday
the
sweet
smell
of
cucugnanian
virtue
was
heady
for
many
kilometres
around
and
the
good
priest
monsieur
martin
happy
and
full
of
joy
dreamt
one
night
that
he
was
followed
by
all
his
flock
as
he
ascended
in
a
resplendent
procession
clouded
in
fragrant
incense
with
choir
boys
chanting
the
te
deum
they
were
all
following
the
light
to
the
city
of
god
there
you
are
the
story
of
the
priest
of
cucugnan
as
i
was
told
by
the
great
colloquial
writer
roumanille
who
had
it
himself
from
some
other
good
fellow
the
old
folks
a
letter
father
azan
yes
monsieur
it
from
paris
the
good
father
azan
was
so
proud
that
it
came
from
paris
not
me
though
a
little
bird
told
me
that
this
unexpected
letter
which
had
just
fallen
into
my
lap
was
going
to
cost
me
the
rest
of
the
day
i
was
not
wrong
as
you
will
see
must
ask
you
for
a
favour
friend
i
want
you
to
lock
up
your
windmill
for
the
day
and
go
directly
to
eyguières
eyguières
is
a
large
market
town
a
few
kilometres
from
here
an
easy
walk
when
you
get
there
ask
for
the
convent
of
the
orphans
the
first
house
after
the
convent
is
a
single
storey
house
with
grey
shutters
and
a
small
do
knock
just
go
in
the
door
is
always
open
and
shout
at
the
top
of
your
voice
hello
folks
i
maurice
friend
you
will
then
see
two
very
old
folks
hold
out
their
arms
to
you
from
the
depths
of
their
large
armchairs
give
them
a
heartfelt
hug
from
me
as
if
they
were
your
own
then
you
might
like
to
talk
to
them
they
will
be
very
boring
about
me
though
and
tell
you
a
thousand
and
one
tales
but
do
listen
respectfully
no
laughing
you
wo
laugh
will
you
they
are
my
grandparents
and
i
am
everything
in
the
world
to
them
but
they
have
seen
me
for
ten
long
years
i
ca
help
it
paris
keeps
me
busy
and
they
are
so
old
so
that
even
if
they
tried
to
visit
me
they
could
make
it
fortunately
you
will
be
there
for
them
my
dear
miller
and
when
you
embrace
them
they
will
feel
almost
as
if
i
were
there
i
have
often
mentioned
you
by
name
and
our
special
friendship
which
to
hell
with
that
sort
of
friend
it
was
fine
weather
but
certainly
not
walking
weather
too
much
sun
and
too
much
mistral
a
typical
provencal
day
to
be
sure
by
the
time
this
damned
letter
arrived
i
had
already
decided
on
my
for
the
day
it
was
to
be
in
the
shelter
of
two
rocks
and
i
was
looking
forward
to
basking
like
a
lizard
and
soaking
up
the
provencal
light
as
i
listened
to
the
pines
singing
oh
well
there
was
nothing
else
for
it
i
grumbled
as
i
locked
up
the
windmill
and
put
the
key
under
the
cane
pipe
and
i
was
on
my
way
i
arrived
at
eyguières
at
about
two
the
village
was
deserted
everybody
was
out
in
the
fields
in
the
white
elms
in
the
courtyard
the
cicadas
were
singing
their
hearts
out
just
like
they
do
in
the
crau
plain
an
ass
was
sunning
itself
in
the
town
hall
square
and
a
flock
of
pigeons
were
in
the
church
fountain
but
there
nobody
to
direct
me
to
the
orphanage
luckily
i
came
across
an
old
fairy
squatting
and
spinning
her
thread
in
a
corner
of
her
doorway
i
told
her
what
i
was
looking
for
and
so
powerful
was
she
that
as
she
raised
her
distaff
the
convent
of
the
orphans
appeared
as
if
by
magic
before
me
it
was
a
big
black
bleak
house
proudly
boasting
an
old
red
sandstone
cross
with
a
short
latin
inscription
above
its
pointed
door
arch
i
spotted
a
smaller
house
next
door
with
grey
shutters
and
a
i
recognised
it
immediately
and
went
in
without
knocking
the
long
cool
quiet
entrance
hall
made
a
impression
on
me
with
its
pink
painted
wall
and
faded
flowers
and
violins
on
the
panelling
i
saw
a
small
garden
shaking
about
in
the
wind
beyond
a
light
coloured
awning
i
seemed
to
have
come
to
the
home
of
some
sort
of
antediluvian
bailiff
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
on
the
left
the
ticking
of
a
large
clock
could
be
heard
through
a
half
opened
door
and
the
voice
of
a
child
reading
each
syllable
carefully
th
en
saint
i
re
naeus
cri
ed
i
am
the
wh
eat
of
the
lord
i
mu
st
be
gro
und
by
the
tee
th
of
th
ese
a
ni
mals
i
went
gently
over
to
the
door
and
looked
in
in
the
quiet
and
of
the
small
room
there
was
an
old
man
with
flushed
cheeks
and
wrinkled
to
the
end
of
his
finger
tips
he
was
fast
asleep
slumped
in
an
armchair
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
hands
on
his
knees
at
his
feet
was
a
very
young
girl
dressed
all
in
blue
a
large
cape
and
a
small
bonnet
the
orphanage
uniform
she
was
reading
the
life
of
irenaeus
from
a
book
larger
than
herself
this
wonderful
reading
had
a
soporific
effect
on
the
whole
household
the
old
man
sleeping
in
his
armchair
the
flies
on
the
ceiling
and
even
the
caged
canaries
in
the
window
the
big
clock
was
quietly
grinding
away
nothing
moved
in
the
room
except
from
within
a
large
band
of
white
light
which
fell
from
between
the
closed
shutters
which
was
full
of
sparkling
movement
and
microscopic
waltzes
in
the
midst
of
all
this
general
stupor
the
child
continued
her
solemn
reading
s
oon
two
lions
jum
ped
on
him
and
de
vour
ed
him
then
i
appeared
the
actual
arrival
of
the
lions
in
the
room
could
not
have
caused
more
panic
it
was
a
moment
of
pure
theatre
the
tot
screamed
the
book
fell
the
canaries
and
flies
bestirred
themselves
the
clock
chimed
and
the
old
man
sat
up
startled
i
was
a
little
flustered
myself
and
froze
at
the
doorsill
shouting
as
loud
as
i
could
hello
folks
i
maurice
friend
well
you
should
have
seen
the
poor
old
soul
come
with
to
hug
me
and
shake
my
hand
and
pace
wildly
round
the
room
going
my
god
my
god
his
wrinkled
face
broke
into
deep
creases
of
laughter
he
flushed
and
stuttered
oh
monsieur
oh
monsieur
then
he
went
to
the
back
of
the
room
and
called
out
for
mamette
a
door
opened
a
scurrying
was
heard
in
the
passage
and
there
she
stood
mamette
as
pretty
as
a
picture
in
her
bonnet
her
habit
and
her
embroidered
hanky
which
she
held
in
the
respectful
way
it
was
so
touching
they
looked
completely
alike
with
his
hair
done
up
and
yellow
shells
he
could
have
been
another
mamette
except
that
the
real
one
must
have
cried
a
lot
in
her
life
as
she
was
even
more
wrinkled
than
he
she
too
had
a
girl
carer
from
the
orphanage
a
little
nurse
dressed
in
a
blue
cape
who
never
left
her
side
to
see
these
old
folks
cared
for
by
the
orphans
was
unimaginably
moving
mamette
began
by
addressing
me
rather
too
formerly
but
the
old
fellow
cut
her
off
he
maurice
friend
the
effect
was
immediate
she
stood
there
trembling
crying
and
blushing
even
more
than
he
was
that
old
people
for
you
only
a
drop
of
blood
in
their
veins
but
at
the
least
emotion
it
leaps
to
their
faces
quick
get
a
chair
said
the
old
woman
to
her
little
companion
open
the
blinds
cried
the
old
man
to
his
the
couple
took
a
hand
each
and
trotted
me
over
to
the
window
which
they
opened
wide
to
get
a
better
look
at
me
once
they
got
back
into
their
armchairs
i
sat
down
between
them
on
a
folding
stool
and
with
the
little
blues
stationed
behind
us
the
grand
interrogation
began
how
is
he
what
is
he
doing
with
himself
why
does
he
come
is
he
settled
in
and
so
on
and
so
forth
for
hours
on
end
i
was
answering
all
their
questions
as
best
i
could
filling
in
the
details
that
i
knew
shamelessly
inventing
those
i
did
without
ever
admitting
that
i
had
noticed
if
his
windows
were
or
the
colour
of
his
bedroom
wallpaper
the
bedroom
wallpaper
it
blue
madame
pale
blue
with
a
floral
pattern
on
it
really
went
the
old
lady
fondly
and
added
turning
to
her
husband
he
such
a
fine
boy
oh
yes
he
such
a
fine
boy
he
echoed
enthusiastically
all
the
time
i
was
speaking
they
shook
their
heads
at
one
another
and
chuckled
and
gave
knowing
winks
and
nods
to
each
other
then
the
old
fellow
drew
close
to
me
speak
louder
she
a
bit
hard
of
hearing
and
she
said
speak
up
please
he
ca
hear
very
well
so
i
raised
my
voice
which
evinced
a
grateful
smile
and
as
these
smiles
faded
i
could
just
make
out
a
faint
image
of
maurice
i
was
overwhelmed
to
see
it
a
vague
veiled
yet
evasive
vision
as
if
i
had
seen
my
friend
himself
smile
back
at
me
but
in
the
misty
distance
suddenly
the
old
man
sat
up
in
his
armchair
i
wondering
mamette
if
perhaps
he
has
had
any
lunch
mamette
shocked
threw
her
hands
in
the
air
not
eaten
good
lord
i
thought
they
were
still
on
about
maurice
and
i
was
about
to
reassure
them
that
their
dear
grandson
always
ate
before
midday
but
it
turned
out
it
was
actually
me
they
were
concerned
about
there
was
some
consternation
when
i
admitted
that
nothing
had
passed
my
lips
quick
lay
the
table
little
blues
put
it
in
the
middle
of
the
room
use
the
table
cloth
and
the
decorated
plates
and
do
please
stop
giggling
so
much
and
make
haste
certainly
they
did
hurry
and
the
dinner
was
soon
served
up
three
broken
plates
later
there
you
are
a
fine
breakfast
for
you
said
mamette
urging
me
to
the
table
you
will
be
dining
alone
though
the
rest
of
us
have
already
eaten
this
morning
the
poor
old
things
whatever
the
hour
they
would
have
always
claimed
they
already
eaten
all
mamette
would
have
had
for
a
breakfast
was
a
little
bit
of
milk
some
dates
and
a
tartlet
and
that
had
to
keep
herself
and
her
canaries
going
for
a
least
a
week
and
to
think
that
it
was
i
who
finished
off
their
supplies
also
what
indignation
there
was
around
at
the
table
the
little
blues
propped
up
on
their
elbows
whispered
to
each
other
from
inside
their
cage
the
canaries
seemed
to
be
saying
what
sort
of
man
would
eat
all
our
tartlet
in
fact
i
did
finish
it
off
almost
unconsciously
i
was
busy
looking
around
the
light
and
peaceful
room
where
the
scent
of
antiques
seemed
to
drift
in
the
air
there
were
two
small
beds
in
particular
that
i
could
take
my
eyes
off
i
pictured
the
beds
almost
as
small
as
two
cots
early
in
the
morning
when
they
are
hidden
under
their
great
fringed
curtains
three
chimes
the
time
when
all
old
people
wake
up
are
you
asleep
mamette
no
my
dear
is
maurice
a
fine
boy
oh
yes
a
fine
boy
and
i
imagined
a
whole
conversation
in
that
vein
inspired
by
just
looking
at
the
old
folks
two
little
beds
laying
side
by
side
meanwhile
quite
a
drama
was
taking
place
in
front
of
the
wardrobe
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
there
was
a
jar
of
cherries
in
brandy
in
the
top
drawer
waiting
for
maurice
for
ten
years
and
which
they
now
wanted
me
to
have
despite
mamette
pleas
the
old
fellow
had
insisted
on
getting
the
cherries
down
himself
and
stood
on
a
chair
to
try
to
reach
them
to
his
wife
great
horror
picture
the
scene
the
old
man
trembling
and
hoisting
himself
up
the
little
blues
clinging
to
his
chair
mamette
puffing
and
blowing
behind
him
her
arms
outstretched
i
caught
a
light
scent
of
bergamot
wafting
from
the
open
wardrobe
with
its
large
piles
of
discoloured
linen
it
was
a
charming
sight
at
last
after
much
struggling
the
much
vaunted
jar
was
fetched
from
the
drawer
together
with
a
dented
old
silver
tumbler
which
belonged
to
maurice
as
a
child
it
was
filled
to
the
brim
for
me
although
it
was
maurice
who
loved
cherries
so
much
while
serving
me
the
old
chap
spoke
into
my
ear
with
the
air
of
someone
who
knew
about
gourmet
things
you
are
very
lucky
to
be
able
to
have
these
my
wife
made
them
herself
you
are
about
to
taste
something
very
good
unfortunately
while
making
them
she
had
forgotten
to
add
any
sugar
what
do
you
expect
you
get
when
you
get
old
the
cherries
were
truly
awful
my
poor
mamette
but
it
did
stop
me
from
eating
them
to
very
the
last
one
without
batting
an
eyelid
the
meal
finished
i
stood
up
ready
to
take
my
leave
they
really
would
have
liked
me
to
stay
longer
to
chat
about
their
precious
grandson
but
the
day
was
drawing
to
a
close
i
was
a
long
way
from
home
and
it
was
time
to
go
the
old
man
stood
up
with
me
mamette
my
coat
i
want
to
accompany
him
to
the
square
naturally
mamette
was
quietly
worried
that
it
was
a
bit
too
cold
now
for
him
to
go
out
but
she
did
let
on
except
as
she
was
helping
him
into
his
spanish
smoking
jacket
with
mother
of
pearl
buttons
i
heard
the
dear
old
soul
gently
saying
you
wo
be
out
too
long
will
you
ah
ha
i
do
know
you
have
to
wait
and
see
he
answered
a
touch
mischievously
with
that
they
exchanged
looks
and
laughed
and
the
little
blues
joined
in
a
mood
caught
even
by
the
canaries
in
their
chirping
way
between
ourselves
i
think
they
had
all
been
a
bit
intoxicated
by
the
smell
of
the
cherries
night
fell
as
the
grandfather
and
i
went
out
his
little
blue
followed
us
at
a
distance
to
help
him
home
but
he
never
noticed
her
and
he
was
proud
fit
to
burst
to
walk
on
my
arm
like
a
man
mamette
beaming
saw
it
from
her
doorstep
and
nodded
her
head
as
she
looked
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
say
well
well
he
my
very
own
dear
little
man
and
he
still
has
some
go
in
him
prose
ballads
when
i
opened
my
door
this
morning
i
was
surprised
by
a
great
carpet
of
around
the
windmill
grass
sparkled
and
crackled
like
shattered
glass
the
whole
hillside
tinkled
and
twinkled
for
a
day
my
beloved
provence
was
dressed
up
as
a
northern
land
it
was
here
amongst
these
pines
and
clumps
of
lavender
in
crystal
bouquets
that
i
wrote
both
these
fantasies
prompted
by
the
white
frost
gleaming
at
me
and
great
of
storks
from
heinrich
heine
land
made
their
way
in
a
clear
sky
to
the
camargue
screaming
it
cold
it
cold
it
cold
i
death
of
the
dauphin
the
little
dauphin
is
sick
the
truth
is
he
dying
in
every
church
in
the
kingdom
the
blessèd
sacrament
is
displayed
night
and
day
and
huge
candles
burn
all
the
time
for
the
recovery
of
the
royal
child
the
roads
around
the
old
residence
are
miserable
and
silent
the
clocks
do
chime
and
the
coaches
go
at
walking
pace
around
the
palace
through
the
railings
the
curious
bourgeoisie
are
watching
some
potbellied
swiss
who
are
talking
in
the
courtyards
the
whole
castle
is
troubled
chamberlains
and
scurry
up
and
down
the
marble
stairways
the
galleries
are
filled
with
pages
and
courtesans
flitting
from
group
to
group
seeking
some
whisper
of
news
on
the
grand
stairs
the
weeping
hold
themselves
respectfully
and
delicately
wipe
their
eyes
with
finely
embroidered
handkerchiefs
in
the
orangery
there
were
numerous
gatherings
of
enrobed
doctors
they
can
be
seen
through
the
windows
adjusting
their
long
black
sleeves
and
carefully
rearranging
their
wigs
the
dauphin
governor
and
his
equerry
are
pacing
about
in
front
of
the
door
awaiting
the
doctors
prognostications
some
kitchen
boys
walk
past
them
without
bowing
the
equerry
swears
like
a
trooper
while
the
governor
recites
some
verses
by
horace
meanwhile
a
long
plaintive
whinny
was
heard
from
down
in
the
stables
it
was
the
young
dauphin
chestnut
now
forgotten
by
its
grooms
calling
mournfully
over
its
empty
manger
and
the
king
where
is
his
majesty
the
king
the
king
is
all
alone
in
a
room
at
the
far
side
of
the
castle
royal
highnesses
like
to
be
seen
crying
it
is
another
thing
altogether
with
the
queen
sitting
by
the
bedside
of
the
little
dauphin
her
beautiful
face
is
bathed
in
tears
as
she
sobs
out
loud
in
front
of
everybody
just
as
any
commoner
would
in
his
the
little
dauphin
whiter
than
the
cushions
he
lies
on
has
his
eyes
closed
and
looks
fast
asleep
but
he
is
not
the
little
dauphin
turns
towards
his
mother
and
seeing
her
in
tears
says
madame
why
are
you
crying
do
you
really
think
that
i
am
dying
the
queen
tries
to
answer
but
the
sobbing
chokes
her
words
do
upset
yourself
madame
you
are
forgetting
that
i
am
the
dauphin
and
dauphins
ca
die
just
like
that
the
queen
sobs
intensify
and
the
little
dauphin
begins
to
feel
afraid
hang
on
he
says
i
do
want
death
to
come
and
take
me
and
i
know
just
how
to
stop
him
from
getting
to
me
have
forty
very
strong
soldiers
mount
guard
around
my
bed
have
a
hundred
big
cannons
ready
under
our
window
tapers
lit
and
fuses
primed
day
and
night
and
hard
luck
death
if
he
dares
to
come
near
me
to
please
the
royal
child
the
queen
gives
the
order
soon
big
cannons
are
heard
rolling
in
the
courtyard
and
forty
tall
german
mercenaries
halberds
at
the
ready
come
and
position
themselves
around
the
bed
chamber
the
little
dauphin
claps
his
hands
when
he
sees
the
old
soldiers
and
their
grey
moustaches
he
recognises
one
of
them
and
calls
out
lorrain
lorrain
the
soldier
steps
forward
towards
the
bed
i
really
do
like
you
my
dear
lorrain
have
you
brought
your
big
sword
if
death
comes
for
me
you
will
be
sure
to
kill
him
you
lorrain
replied
yes
sire
and
two
big
tears
run
slowly
down
his
tanned
cheeks
just
then
the
chaplain
comes
towards
the
young
dauphin
and
whispers
to
him
for
some
time
showing
him
a
crucifix
the
little
dauphin
listens
and
looks
astounded
and
then
suddenly
stops
him
i
can
understand
what
you
are
telling
me
monsieur
priest
but
could
my
little
friend
beppo
die
in
my
place
for
which
service
we
could
give
him
a
lot
of
money
the
chaplain
continues
the
whispering
and
the
little
dauphin
looks
more
and
more
astonished
as
soon
as
the
chaplain
finishes
the
little
dauphin
gives
a
huge
sigh
and
says
everything
you
tell
me
is
so
sad
monsieur
priest
but
if
there
one
thing
that
consoles
me
it
that
up
there
amongst
the
stars
in
paradise
i
will
still
be
the
dauphin
i
am
sure
that
the
good
lord
is
my
cousin
and
wo
forget
to
treat
me
according
to
my
rank
then
turning
towards
his
mother
he
adds
have
my
best
clothes
brought
to
me
my
white
ermine
doublet
and
my
velvet
court
shoes
i
want
to
make
myself
nice
for
the
angels
and
enter
paradise
dressed
as
a
dauphin
should
for
a
third
time
the
chaplain
leans
towards
the
little
dauphin
and
whispers
to
him
for
some
time
in
the
middle
of
his
discourse
the
royal
child
interrupts
him
angrily
well
then
he
cries
it
completely
pointless
being
the
dauphin
the
little
dauphin
has
heard
enough
and
he
turns
towards
the
wall
sobbing
bitterly
ii
the
takes
a
day
off
the
was
on
his
rounds
he
was
being
carried
majestically
in
the
official
barouche
complete
with
coachman
and
lackey
to
the
regional
selection
meeting
the
had
put
on
his
best
embroidered
clothes
his
opera
hat
his
silver
striped
breeches
and
his
with
mother
of
pearl
handle
for
this
important
day
he
was
looking
ruefully
down
at
his
knees
on
which
lies
a
large
briefcase
the
was
thinking
about
the
speech
which
he
must
soon
give
before
the
residents
of
gentlemen
and
constituents
but
he
might
just
as
well
have
twiddled
with
his
blond
whiskers
and
repeated
it
twenty
times
for
all
the
good
it
did
gentlemen
and
constituents
but
nothing
more
of
the
speech
would
come
nothing
more
of
the
speech
would
come
it
was
getting
really
warm
in
the
barouche
under
the
midi
sun
the
road
to
shimmers
until
it
fades
into
the
distance
the
very
air
burns
you
and
at
the
roadside
thousands
of
cicadas
are
calling
to
each
other
from
one
white
elm
to
another
suddenly
the
started
down
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
he
noticed
a
small
wood
of
green
oaks
which
seemed
to
beckon
him
the
small
wood
of
green
oaks
which
seemed
to
beckon
him
come
over
here
you
will
find
composing
your
speech
much
easier
in
the
shade
of
my
trees
the
was
captivated
he
jumped
down
from
the
barouche
and
told
his
men
to
wait
there
for
him
as
he
was
going
to
compose
his
speech
over
in
the
small
wood
of
green
oaks
in
the
small
wood
of
green
oaks
there
were
birds
violets
and
springs
hidden
in
the
delicate
grass
when
the
birds
noticed
the
with
his
gorgeous
breeches
and
his
large
briefcase
they
became
alarmed
and
stop
singing
the
springs
are
scared
and
stop
their
babbling
and
the
violets
hid
themselves
in
the
grass
this
whole
world
in
miniature
had
never
seen
a
before
and
they
quietly
wondered
who
this
dignitary
was
walking
around
in
silver
breeches
meanwhile
the
delighted
by
the
silence
and
the
coolness
of
the
wood
lifted
his
put
his
hat
on
the
grass
and
sat
down
in
the
moss
at
the
foot
of
a
young
oak
he
then
put
the
large
briefcase
on
his
knees
opened
it
and
took
out
a
long
sheet
of
official
paper
he
an
artist
said
the
warbler
no
said
the
bullfinch
he
not
an
artist
with
his
silver
breeches
he
more
of
a
prince
he
more
of
a
prince
said
the
bullfinch
he
neither
an
artist
nor
a
prince
interrupted
an
old
nightingale
who
had
sang
all
season
in
the
district
gardens
i
know
what
he
is
he
a
and
the
whole
woodland
came
alive
with
the
rumour
he
a
he
a
he
bald
remarked
a
crested
lark
the
violets
asked
is
he
a
bad
man
is
he
a
bad
man
asked
the
violets
the
old
nightingale
replied
not
at
all
and
with
that
reassurance
the
birds
started
to
sing
again
the
streams
to
flow
and
the
violets
to
perfume
the
air
just
as
though
the
gentleman
was
there
ignoring
all
this
pretty
clamour
the
invoked
the
spirit
of
the
country
fêtes
and
pencil
at
the
ready
began
to
declaim
in
his
ceremonial
voice
gentlemen
and
constituents
gentlemen
and
constituents
said
the
in
his
ceremonial
voice
a
cackle
of
laughter
broke
his
concentration
he
turned
round
and
saw
a
lone
fat
woodpecker
perched
on
his
opera
hat
looking
at
him
and
laughing
the
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
readied
himself
to
continue
but
the
woodpecker
interrupted
him
again
what
is
the
point
i
beg
your
pardon
what
is
the
point
said
the
who
was
flushing
all
over
and
shooing
the
cheeky
animal
away
he
resumed
even
more
pompously
gentlemen
and
constituents
gentlemen
and
constituents
once
again
resumed
the
even
more
pompously
then
the
little
violets
stretched
their
stems
out
towards
him
and
kindly
asked
him
can
you
smell
our
lovely
perfume
and
the
streams
were
making
divine
music
for
him
from
beneath
the
moss
and
over
his
head
in
the
branches
a
band
of
warblers
sang
their
finest
songs
indeed
the
whole
wood
conspired
to
stop
him
composing
his
speech
as
he
composed
his
speech
the
was
intoxicated
by
the
perfume
and
delighted
by
the
music
he
tried
again
to
resist
the
charm
but
in
vain
and
became
completely
overcome
he
propped
himself
up
on
the
grass
with
his
elbows
loosened
his
fine
tails
and
stammers
yet
again
two
or
three
times
gentlemen
and
constituents
gentlemen
and
const
gent
finally
he
sent
his
constituents
to
the
devil
and
the
muse
of
the
country
fêtes
could
only
cover
her
face
cover
your
face
o
muse
of
the
country
fêtes
when
after
an
hour
his
assistants
worried
about
their
master
followed
him
into
the
wood
they
saw
something
that
made
them
recoil
in
horror
the
was
lying
on
his
stomach
in
the
grass
all
dishevelled
like
a
bohemian
he
had
taken
off
his
tails
and
the
was
composing
poetry
as
he
chewed
ruminatively
on
a
violet
bixiou
wallet
one
october
morning
a
few
days
before
i
left
paris
a
man
in
shabby
clothes
turned
up
at
my
home
while
i
was
having
lunch
he
was
bent
over
muddied
and
stooped
and
shivered
on
his
long
legs
like
a
plucked
wading
bird
it
was
bixiou
yes
parisians
your
very
own
bixiou
the
ferociously
charming
bixiou
the
fanatical
satirist
who
has
so
delighted
you
for
fifteen
years
with
his
writings
and
caricatures
oh
poor
man
and
how
painful
to
see
him
like
that
without
the
familiar
grimace
when
he
came
in
i
would
not
have
recognised
him
his
head
was
bent
over
to
one
side
and
his
cane
was
pushed
into
his
mouth
like
a
clarinet
the
illustrious
and
gloomy
jester
then
moved
to
the
centre
of
the
room
and
staggered
against
my
table
as
he
said
despondently
have
pity
on
a
blind
man
it
was
such
a
good
that
i
could
stop
myself
laughing
the
response
came
immediately
if
you
think
i
joking
just
look
into
my
eyes
he
then
turned
two
large
white
sightless
eyes
towards
me
i
gone
blind
my
dear
blind
for
life
that
what
comes
from
writing
with
vitriol
i
have
burned
out
the
candle
of
my
eyes
out
doing
the
damned
job
to
the
stub
he
added
showing
me
his
desiccated
eyelids
with
no
trace
of
an
eyelash
i
was
so
overcome
i
could
find
anything
to
say
my
silence
troubled
him
are
you
working
no
bixiou
i
having
lunch
would
you
like
to
join
me
he
did
reply
but
i
could
see
clearly
from
his
quivering
nostrils
that
he
was
dying
to
say
yes
i
took
his
hand
and
sat
him
down
beside
me
while
i
served
him
the
poor
devil
sniffed
at
the
food
and
chuckled
oh
it
smells
good
this
i
really
going
to
enjoy
it
and
it
will
be
an
age
before
i
eat
again
a
sou
worth
of
bread
every
morning
as
i
traipse
through
the
ministries
is
all
i
get
i
tell
you
i
really
badgering
the
ministries
now
it
the
only
work
i
do
i
am
trying
to
get
permission
to
run
a
tobacconist
shop
what
else
can
i
do
got
to
eat
i
ca
draw
i
ca
write
dictation
but
dictate
what
i
have
a
clue
me
i
ca
think
of
a
thing
to
write
my
trade
was
to
look
at
the
lunacies
of
paris
and
hold
a
mirror
up
to
them
but
i
have
got
what
it
takes
now
then
i
thought
about
a
tobacconist
shop
not
in
the
boulevards
of
course
i
ca
expect
those
kind
of
favours
being
neither
a
show
girl
mother
nor
a
field
officer
widow
no
i
just
looking
for
a
small
shop
in
the
provinces
somewhere
far
away
say
a
spot
in
the
vosges
i
will
sell
a
hell
of
a
clay
pipe
and
console
myself
by
wrapping
tobacco
in
my
contemporaries
writings
that
all
i
want
not
too
much
to
ask
is
it
but
do
you
know
what
its
hell
on
earth
to
get
it
yet
i
should
be
short
of
patronage
i
have
soared
high
in
my
time
i
used
to
dine
with
the
marshal
the
prince
and
ministers
all
those
people
wanted
me
then
because
i
amused
them
or
frightened
them
now
no
one
does
oh
my
eyes
my
poor
poor
eyes
i
not
welcome
anywhere
now
it
unbearable
being
blind
at
meal
times
do
pass
me
the
bread
please
oh
those
thieves
they
will
make
me
pay
through
the
nose
for
this
damned
tobacconist
shop
i
been
wandering
through
all
the
ministries
clutching
my
petition
for
the
last
six
months
i
go
in
the
morning
at
the
time
they
light
the
stoves
and
take
his
excellence
horse
around
the
sanded
courtyard
and
i
do
leave
until
night
when
they
bring
in
the
big
lights
and
the
kitchens
begin
to
smell
really
good
all
my
life
is
spent
sitting
on
the
wooden
chests
in
the
antechambers
the
ushers
know
who
i
am
as
well
enough
said
inside
the
court
they
call
me
kind
man
so
to
get
them
on
my
side
to
amuse
them
i
practise
my
wit
or
in
a
corner
of
their
blotters
i
draw
rough
caricatures
without
taking
the
pen
off
the
page
see
what
i
come
to
after
twenty
years
of
outstanding
success
look
at
just
what
an
artist
life
amounts
to
and
to
think
there
are
forty
thousand
rascals
in
france
who
slobber
over
our
work
to
think
that
throughout
paris
every
day
locomotives
make
steam
to
bring
us
loads
of
idiots
thirsting
for
waffle
and
printed
gossip
oh
what
a
world
of
fantasists
if
only
bixiou
suffering
could
teach
them
a
lesson
with
that
and
without
another
word
he
pushed
his
face
towards
the
plate
and
began
to
scoff
the
food
it
was
pitiful
to
look
at
he
was
losing
his
bread
and
his
fork
and
groping
for
his
glass
all
the
time
poor
soul
he
just
had
had
the
time
to
get
used
to
it
all
yet
after
a
short
time
he
spoke
again
do
you
know
what
even
worse
it
not
being
able
to
read
the
damned
newspapers
you
have
to
be
in
the
trade
to
understand
that
sometimes
at
night
when
i
am
coming
home
i
buy
one
just
for
the
smell
of
the
fresh
moist
paper
and
newsprint
it
so
good
but
not
a
soul
willing
to
read
it
to
me
my
wife
could
but
she
want
to
she
makes
out
that
there
are
indecent
things
in
the
news
items
these
old
mistresses
once
they
marry
you
there
no
one
more
prudish
that
madame
bixiou
has
turned
herself
into
a
right
little
bigot
but
only
as
far
as
it
suits
her
it
was
she
who
wanted
to
me
rub
my
eyes
in
salette
water
and
then
there
was
the
blessed
bread
the
pilgrimages
the
holy
child
the
chinese
herbal
remedies
and
god
knows
what
else
we
up
to
our
necks
in
good
works
and
yet
it
would
be
a
real
kindness
to
read
the
papers
to
me
but
there
you
are
no
chance
she
simply
does
want
to
if
my
daughter
was
still
at
home
she
would
but
since
i
became
blind
i
sent
her
to
the
so
there
be
one
less
mouth
to
feed
now
there
another
one
sent
to
test
me
she
only
had
nine
years
on
earth
and
already
she
had
every
imaginable
illness
and
miserable
and
ugly
uglier
than
i
am
if
that
possible
a
real
monster
what
do
you
expect
i
have
never
known
how
to
face
up
to
my
responsibilities
well
what
good
company
i
turned
out
to
be
boring
you
with
my
family
business
and
what
it
all
got
to
do
with
you
come
on
give
me
a
bit
more
brandy
i
better
be
off
when
i
leave
here
i
am
off
to
the
public
information
service
and
the
ushers
are
not
famed
for
their
sense
of
humour
they
all
retired
teachers
i
poured
him
some
brandy
he
sipped
it
and
then
seemed
moved
by
something
suddenly
on
a
whim
i
think
he
got
up
glass
in
hand
and
briefly
moved
his
blind
head
around
with
the
amiable
smile
of
someone
about
to
speak
and
then
speaking
in
a
strident
voice
as
if
holding
forth
to
a
banquet
for
two
hundred
to
the
arts
to
literature
to
the
press
and
there
he
stood
spouting
a
toast
for
fully
ten
minutes
it
was
the
most
wild
the
most
marvellous
improvisation
which
his
clown
brain
could
devise
imagine
a
revue
entitled
of
letters
of
about
our
literati
our
gossip
our
quarrels
all
the
idiocies
of
an
eccentric
world
a
cesspool
of
ink
hell
in
miniature
where
you
cut
your
own
throat
disembowel
yourself
rob
yourself
and
outtalk
the
bourgeoisie
about
interest
rates
and
money
where
they
let
you
starve
to
death
better
than
anywhere
else
all
our
cowardice
and
woes
old
baron
t
of
la
tombola
going
away
with
a
to
the
tuileries
with
his
begging
bowl
and
his
flowery
clothes
then
there
the
deaths
the
burial
announcements
the
never
changing
funeral
oration
of
the
delegate
the
missed
poor
dear
over
some
unlucky
soul
who
was
refused
the
means
to
bury
himself
the
suicides
and
those
gone
insane
imagine
all
that
told
itemised
and
gesticulated
by
an
orator
of
genius
and
you
will
then
have
some
idea
of
what
improvisation
was
about
the
toast
over
his
glass
empty
he
asked
me
what
the
time
was
and
left
in
a
wild
mood
without
so
much
as
saying
goodbye
i
do
know
how
monsieur
duruy
ushers
were
affected
by
his
visit
that
morning
but
i
do
know
that
after
that
awful
blind
man
had
left
i
have
never
felt
so
sad
so
bad
in
the
whole
of
my
life
the
very
sight
of
ink
sickened
me
my
pen
horrified
me
i
wanted
to
distance
myself
from
it
all
to
run
away
to
see
trees
to
feel
something
good
real
good
god
the
hatred
the
venom
the
unquenchable
need
to
belittle
it
all
to
befoul
everything
oh
that
wretched
man
then
i
furiously
paced
up
and
down
in
my
room
still
hearing
the
giggling
disgust
he
had
shown
for
his
daughter
right
then
i
felt
something
under
my
feet
near
where
the
blind
man
had
been
sitting
bending
down
i
recognised
his
wallet
a
thick
worn
wallet
with
split
corners
which
he
always
carried
with
him
and
laughingly
called
his
pocket
of
venom
this
wallet
in
our
world
was
as
famous
as
monsieur
de
cartoons
rumour
has
it
that
there
are
some
awful
things
in
it
i
was
soon
to
discover
the
truth
of
it
the
old
wallet
had
burst
open
as
it
fell
and
the
papers
inside
fell
onto
the
carpet
i
had
to
collect
them
one
by
one
there
was
a
package
of
letters
written
on
decorated
paper
all
beginning
dear
daddy
and
signed
bixiou
at
the
children
of
mary
there
were
old
prescriptions
for
childhood
ailments
croup
convulsions
scarlet
fever
and
measles
the
poor
little
girl
missed
out
on
a
single
one
of
them
finally
there
was
a
hidden
envelope
from
which
came
a
two
or
three
curly
blond
hairs
which
might
have
come
from
the
girl
bonnet
there
was
some
writing
on
it
in
a
large
unsteady
hand
the
handwriting
of
a
blind
man
hair
cut
the
may
the
day
she
went
to
that
that
all
there
was
in
bixiou
wallet
let
face
it
parisians
you
all
the
same
disgust
irony
evil
laughter
at
vicious
jokes
and
what
does
it
all
amount
to
hair
cut
on
the
the
man
with
the
golden
brain
the
lady
who
wants
pleasant
i
took
your
letter
madame
as
an
invitation
to
change
my
ways
i
have
been
tempted
to
shade
my
little
tales
a
touch
too
darkly
and
i
promised
myself
to
give
you
something
joyful
wildly
joyful
today
after
all
what
have
i
got
to
be
sad
about
here
i
am
living
hundreds
of
kilometres
from
the
fogs
of
paris
on
a
radiantly
beautiful
hillside
in
the
land
of
the
tambourine
and
muscat
wine
around
my
windmill
everything
is
sunshine
and
music
i
have
wind
orchestras
of
wheatears
bands
of
and
choirs
of
curlews
from
morning
to
midday
and
the
cicadas
and
the
shepherds
playing
their
fifes
and
the
dark
haired
young
beauties
laughing
amongst
the
vines
to
tell
the
truth
this
is
no
place
for
brooding
i
rather
rush
poems
and
basketsful
of
spicy
stories
to
you
ladies
and
yet
i
ca
i
am
still
too
near
to
paris
every
day
even
here
amongst
my
precious
pines
it
finds
me
with
its
fingers
of
misery
even
as
i
write
i
have
just
heard
the
lamentable
news
of
the
death
of
poor
charles
barbara
and
my
windmill
is
plunged
into
grief
farewell
curlews
and
cicadas
i
have
the
heart
for
jollity
right
now
for
that
reason
madam
instead
of
the
pretty
little
tale
which
i
had
promised
you
will
only
have
yet
another
melancholy
story
today
once
there
was
a
man
with
a
golden
brain
yes
madame
a
brain
made
entirely
from
gold
at
birth
the
doctors
thought
he
would
survive
long
so
heavy
was
his
head
and
so
oversized
his
skull
however
he
did
live
and
he
thrived
in
the
sunshine
like
a
lovely
olive
tree
except
that
his
huge
head
went
everywhere
with
him
and
it
was
pitiful
to
see
him
bumping
into
all
the
furniture
as
he
walked
about
the
house
all
too
often
he
would
fall
down
one
day
he
fell
from
the
top
flight
of
some
marble
steps
and
just
happened
to
catch
his
head
on
one
his
head
rang
like
an
ingot
it
could
have
killed
him
but
when
he
got
up
there
was
nothing
wrong
except
there
was
a
small
wound
with
two
or
three
traces
of
congealed
gold
in
his
blond
locks
that
was
how
his
parents
learned
that
their
child
had
a
brain
of
pure
gold
it
was
kept
a
close
secret
and
the
poor
little
thing
himself
suspected
nothing
sometimes
he
would
ask
why
he
was
allowed
to
go
outside
to
play
with
the
other
boys
in
the
street
someone
would
steal
from
you
my
treasure
his
mother
told
him
then
the
little
lad
being
terrified
of
being
robbed
made
no
complaint
as
he
went
back
to
playing
alone
and
dragging
himself
sadly
from
room
to
room
was
until
he
was
eighteen
years
old
that
his
parents
told
him
of
this
monstrous
gift
from
fate
since
they
had
nurtured
him
and
fed
him
all
his
life
they
told
him
that
it
was
about
time
he
paid
them
back
with
some
of
his
gold
the
child
did
hesitate
he
would
do
it
that
right
then
but
how
the
legend
did
tell
him
he
pulled
out
a
nut
sized
piece
of
gold
from
his
skull
and
placed
it
proudly
onto
his
mother
lap
then
dazzled
by
the
riches
within
his
head
he
became
maddened
by
desire
and
drunk
with
power
so
he
left
the
family
home
and
went
out
into
the
world
to
squander
his
treasure
by
the
way
he
was
living
his
life
royally
and
spreading
his
gold
around
lavishly
you
would
have
thought
his
brain
inexhaustible
and
yet
it
did
become
exhausted
as
could
be
seen
by
the
dullness
in
his
eyes
and
his
pinched
cheeks
finally
one
morning
after
a
night
of
wild
debauchery
the
wretched
boy
alone
amongst
the
debris
of
the
festivities
and
the
dimming
chandeliers
became
terrified
about
the
enormous
hole
appearing
in
his
ingot
of
a
brain
it
was
time
to
stop
from
then
on
he
was
like
a
new
man
the
man
with
the
golden
brain
went
far
away
to
live
alone
and
work
with
his
hands
he
became
suspicious
and
timid
like
a
miser
turning
his
back
on
temptation
and
trying
to
forget
the
fatal
riches
that
he
no
longer
wanted
unfortunately
a
friend
who
knew
of
his
secret
had
followed
him
one
night
the
poor
man
was
suddenly
woken
up
by
an
excruciating
pain
in
his
head
he
jumped
up
frantically
and
caught
sight
of
running
away
in
the
moonlight
with
something
under
his
coat
another
piece
of
brain
had
been
stolen
some
time
later
the
man
with
the
golden
brain
fell
in
love
and
this
time
too
it
came
out
very
badly
he
fell
deeply
in
love
with
a
petite
blond
woman
who
loved
him
a
lot
too
but
who
loved
fripperies
white
feathers
and
pretty
tassels
bobbling
along
the
full
length
of
her
boots
even
more
in
the
hands
of
this
cute
little
creature
half
bird
half
doll
the
gold
pieces
just
melted
away
at
her
pleasure
she
indulged
every
known
whim
and
he
could
never
bring
himself
to
say
no
to
her
he
even
kept
back
the
awful
truth
about
his
fortune
to
the
very
end
for
fear
of
upsetting
her
are
we
really
rich
then
she
would
ask
the
poor
man
could
only
answer
oh
yes
very
rich
and
he
would
smile
lovingly
at
the
little
blue
bird
who
was
unknowingly
eating
away
at
his
head
yet
sometimes
fear
took
hold
of
him
and
he
had
a
craving
to
hang
on
to
what
little
he
got
but
then
the
little
woman
bounded
up
to
him
and
said
husband
you
are
so
rich
buy
me
something
really
expensive
and
so
he
brought
her
something
really
expensive
things
continued
like
that
for
two
years
then
one
morning
the
young
wife
died
like
a
bird
no
one
knew
why
her
funeral
was
paid
for
in
gold
or
at
least
with
what
was
left
of
it
the
widower
arranged
a
lovely
burial
for
his
dear
departed
wife
peals
of
bells
substantial
coaches
done
out
in
black
with
plumed
horses
and
silver
tears
in
the
velvet
drapery
nothing
was
too
good
for
her
after
all
what
did
the
gold
matter
now
he
gave
some
to
the
church
some
to
the
pallbearers
and
some
to
the
sellers
oh
yes
he
spread
it
around
alright
without
stopping
to
count
the
cost
by
the
time
he
left
the
cemetery
he
had
practically
nothing
left
of
his
wonderful
brain
only
a
few
particles
on
the
outside
of
his
skull
then
he
was
seen
going
out
into
the
streets
like
someone
lost
his
hands
stretched
out
in
front
of
him
and
stumbling
like
a
drunkard
in
the
evening
as
the
shops
lit
up
he
stopped
in
front
of
a
large
window
with
a
grand
display
of
material
and
finery
he
stood
and
glared
for
a
long
time
at
two
blue
satin
bootees
trimmed
with
swan
down
i
know
someone
who
will
be
very
pleased
with
those
bootees
he
smiled
to
himself
and
in
denial
of
his
young
wife
death
went
straight
in
to
buy
them
the
shopkeeper
who
was
in
the
back
heard
a
great
scream
she
rushed
out
to
help
and
jumped
back
in
fear
as
she
saw
a
man
standing
propped
up
against
the
counter
and
staring
blankly
at
her
in
one
hand
he
had
the
blue
bootees
with
swan
down
trimmings
and
in
the
other
was
offering
her
some
bloodied
gold
scrapings
in
the
end
of
his
nails
such
madam
is
the
story
of
the
man
with
the
golden
brain
despite
it
air
of
fantasy
this
story
is
true
from
start
to
finish
throughout
the
world
there
are
unfortunate
people
who
are
condemned
to
live
by
their
brains
and
pay
in
that
finest
of
gold
blood
and
sweat
and
tears
for
the
least
thing
in
life
it
brings
them
pain
every
day
and
then
once
they
tire
of
their
suffering
the
poet
frederic
mistral
last
sunday
i
thought
i
had
woken
up
in
montmartre
it
was
raining
the
sky
was
grey
and
the
windmill
was
a
miserable
place
to
be
i
dreaded
staying
in
on
such
a
cold
rainy
day
and
i
felt
the
urge
to
go
and
cheer
myself
up
in
the
company
of
frédéric
mistral
the
great
poet
who
lives
a
few
kilometres
from
my
precious
pines
in
the
small
village
of
maillane
no
sooner
said
than
gone
my
myrtle
walking
stick
my
book
of
montaigne
a
blanket
and
off
i
went
the
fields
were
deserted
our
beautiful
catholic
provence
gives
the
very
earth
itself
a
day
of
rest
on
sundays
the
dogs
are
abandoned
in
the
houses
and
the
farms
are
closed
here
and
there
was
a
carter
wagon
with
its
dripping
tarpaulin
an
old
hooded
woman
in
a
mantle
like
a
dead
leaf
mules
dressed
up
for
a
gala
covered
in
blue
and
white
esparto
red
pompoms
and
silver
bells
jogging
along
with
a
of
folks
from
the
farm
going
to
mass
further
on
there
was
a
small
boat
on
the
irrigation
canal
with
a
fisherman
casting
his
net
from
it
there
was
no
possibility
of
reading
as
i
walked
the
rain
came
down
in
bucketsful
which
the
tramontana
then
obligingly
threw
in
your
face
i
walked
and
after
three
hours
i
reached
the
small
cypress
woods
which
surround
the
district
of
maillane
and
shelter
it
from
the
frightful
wind
nothing
was
stirring
in
the
village
streets
everybody
was
at
high
mass
as
i
passed
in
front
of
the
church
i
heard
a
serpent
playing
and
i
saw
candles
shining
through
the
stained
glass
windows
the
home
is
on
the
far
side
of
the
village
it
the
last
house
on
the
left
on
the
road
to
it
a
small
house
with
a
front
garden
i
went
in
quietly
and
saw
no
one
the
dining
room
door
was
shut
but
i
could
hear
someone
walking
about
and
speaking
loudly
behind
it
a
voice
and
a
step
that
i
knew
only
too
well
i
paused
in
the
whitewashed
corridor
with
my
hand
on
the
doorknob
and
feeling
very
emotional
my
heart
was
he
in
he
working
should
i
wait
wait
till
he
finished
what
the
hell
it
ca
be
helped
i
went
in
well
parisians
when
the
maillane
poet
came
over
to
show
paris
his
book
and
you
saw
him
in
your
salons
this
noble
savage
but
in
town
clothes
with
a
wing
collar
and
top
hat
which
disturbed
him
and
much
as
his
reputation
do
you
think
that
was
mistral
it
was
there
only
one
real
mistral
in
the
world
and
that
the
one
that
i
surprised
last
sunday
in
his
village
with
his
felt
beret
no
waistcoat
a
jacket
a
red
catalonian
sash
round
his
waist
and
with
the
flush
of
inspiration
in
his
cheeks
he
was
superb
with
a
great
smile
as
elegant
as
a
greek
shepherd
bestriding
the
room
manfully
hands
in
pockets
and
making
poetry
on
the
hoof
well
well
well
it
you
daudet
mistral
exclaimed
throwing
himself
around
my
neck
delighted
that
you
thought
to
come
especially
the
day
of
the
maillane
fête
we
got
music
from
avignon
bulls
processions
and
the
farandole
it
will
be
magnificent
when
mother
comes
back
from
the
mass
we
have
lunch
and
then
hey
we
shall
go
to
see
the
pretty
girls
dancing
as
he
was
speaking
i
was
rather
moved
as
i
looked
around
at
the
little
dining
room
with
light
wallpaper
which
i
had
seen
for
such
a
long
time
and
where
i
had
spent
such
happy
hours
nothing
had
changed
there
was
still
the
yellow
check
sofa
the
two
wicker
armchairs
venus
de
milo
and
venus
on
the
fireplace
a
portrait
of
the
poet
by
hébert
a
photograph
by
etienne
garjat
and
his
desk
in
a
place
close
to
the
window
a
small
office
desk
overloaded
with
old
books
and
dictionaries
in
the
middle
of
the
desk
i
noticed
a
large
open
exercise
book
on
it
was
written
the
original
of
his
new
poem
which
should
be
published
on
christmas
day
this
year
frédéric
mistral
has
worked
on
this
poem
for
seven
years
and
it
is
six
months
since
he
wrote
the
last
verse
but
he
wo
release
it
yet
you
see
there
is
always
another
stanza
to
polish
and
another
even
more
sonorous
rhyme
to
find
even
if
mistral
writes
his
verses
in
true
provencal
he
works
as
though
everybody
will
read
it
and
acknowledge
his
craftsmanship
ah
the
brave
poet
montaigne
must
have
had
someone
like
mistral
in
mind
when
he
wrote
of
those
who
when
asked
what
is
the
point
of
spending
so
much
time
and
trouble
on
a
work
of
art
that
can
only
be
seen
by
a
few
people
replied
a
few
is
enough
one
is
enough
none
is
enough
the
very
exercise
book
in
which
had
been
written
was
in
my
hands
and
i
leafed
through
it
with
great
emotion
at
that
moment
fifes
and
tambourines
began
playing
outside
the
window
and
there
was
my
hero
mistral
rushing
to
the
cupboard
fetching
out
glasses
and
bottles
and
dragging
the
table
to
centre
of
the
room
before
opening
the
door
to
the
musicians
and
confiding
to
me
do
laugh
they
have
come
to
give
me
a
little
concert
i
am
a
municipal
councillor
the
little
room
filled
up
with
people
tambourines
were
put
on
chairs
the
old
banner
placed
in
a
corner
and
the
sweet
wine
passed
round
after
several
bottles
had
been
downed
to
monsieur
frédéric
health
the
fête
was
seriously
discussed
concerning
such
matters
as
whether
the
farandole
was
as
good
as
last
year
and
if
the
bulls
had
played
their
part
well
then
the
musicians
moved
off
to
play
concerts
to
other
councillors
just
then
mistral
mother
entered
with
a
flick
of
her
wrists
she
laid
the
table
with
beautiful
white
linen
but
only
for
two
i
was
familiar
with
her
household
routine
i
knew
that
when
mistral
had
company
his
mother
would
sit
down
at
the
table
the
old
dear
only
knows
provencal
and
would
feel
very
uneasy
trying
to
talk
to
french
people
also
she
was
needed
in
the
kitchen
goodness
i
had
a
great
meal
that
day
a
piece
of
roast
goat
some
mountain
cheese
jam
figs
and
muscat
grapes
everything
washed
down
with
a
good
du
which
has
such
a
wonderful
red
colour
in
the
glass
after
the
meal
i
fetched
the
exercise
book
and
put
it
on
the
table
in
front
of
mistral
we
said
we
go
out
said
the
poet
smiling
oh
no
calendal
mistral
resigned
himself
to
his
fate
and
in
his
sweet
musical
voice
while
beating
the
rhythm
with
his
hand
he
began
the
first
canto
of
a
maid
who
fell
in
love
and
madly
and
a
tale
i
told
that
turned
out
sadly
now
of
a
child
of
cassis
if
god
will
it
may
be
as
a
poor
little
boy
casts
out
for
anchovy
outside
the
vesper
bells
ring
the
fireworks
explode
in
the
square
and
the
fifes
play
marching
up
and
down
the
streets
with
the
tambourines
the
bulls
from
the
camargue
bellow
as
they
are
herded
along
but
i
was
listening
to
the
story
of
the
little
fisherman
from
provence
with
my
elbows
on
the
table
cloth
and
my
eyes
filling
with
tears
calendal
was
just
a
fisherman
love
had
forged
him
into
an
heroic
figure
to
win
the
heart
of
his
beloved
the
beautiful
estérelle
he
took
on
herculean
tasks
in
fact
those
twelve
famous
labours
paled
by
comparison
to
his
one
time
having
it
in
mind
to
get
rich
he
invented
some
ingenious
fishing
devices
to
bring
all
the
fish
of
the
sea
into
port
then
there
was
this
terrible
bandit
count
sévéran
who
was
going
to
his
evil
trade
amongst
his
and
molls
what
a
tough
guy
our
little
calendal
turns
out
to
be
one
day
at
he
came
across
two
gangs
of
men
intent
on
violently
settling
their
hash
on
the
grave
of
master
jacques
a
provencal
who
did
the
carpentry
in
the
temple
of
solomon
if
you
please
calendal
threw
himself
into
the
heart
of
the
murderous
mayhem
and
calmed
the
men
and
talked
them
down
these
were
superhuman
efforts
high
up
in
the
rocks
of
lure
there
was
an
inaccessible
cedar
forest
where
even
lumberjacks
would
go
calendal
though
does
go
up
there
all
alone
and
sets
up
camp
for
thirty
days
the
sound
of
his
axe
burying
its
head
into
tree
trunks
is
heard
the
whole
time
the
forest
screams
its
protest
but
one
by
one
the
giant
old
trees
fall
and
roll
into
the
abyss
until
by
the
time
calendal
comes
down
there
is
a
single
cedar
left
on
the
mountain
at
last
in
reward
for
so
many
exploits
the
anchovy
fisherman
won
the
love
of
estérelle
and
was
made
consul
of
cassis
by
its
inhabitants
that
it
then
the
story
of
calendal
but
why
all
this
fuss
about
calendal
the
star
of
the
poem
is
provence
itself
the
provence
of
the
sea
the
provence
of
the
mountains
with
its
history
its
ways
its
legends
its
scenery
indeed
a
whole
people
free
and
true
to
themselves
who
have
found
their
poetic
voice
before
they
die
nowadays
follow
the
roads
the
railways
the
telegraph
poles
hunt
down
the
language
in
the
schools
provence
will
live
for
ever
in
and
that
enough
poetry
said
mistral
closing
his
notebook
to
the
fair
we
went
out
the
whole
village
was
in
the
streets
as
a
great
gust
of
wind
cleared
the
sky
which
radiantly
lit
up
the
red
roofs
still
wet
with
rain
we
arrived
in
time
to
see
the
procession
on
its
way
back
it
took
a
whole
hour
to
go
past
there
was
an
endless
line
of
hooded
white
blue
and
grey
penitents
sisterhoods
of
young
veiled
girls
and
gold
flowered
pink
banners
great
faded
wooden
saints
carried
shoulder
high
by
four
men
there
was
pottery
saints
coloured
like
idols
with
big
bouquets
in
their
hands
copes
monstrances
green
velvet
canopies
crucifixes
framed
in
white
silk
and
everything
waving
in
the
wind
in
the
candle
light
and
the
sunlight
amongst
the
psalms
the
litanies
with
the
bells
ringing
a
full
peal
once
the
procession
was
over
and
the
saints
put
back
into
their
chapels
we
went
to
see
the
bulls
and
then
went
on
the
open
air
games
there
were
men
wrestling
the
hop
skip
and
jump
and
games
of
strangle
the
cat
and
pig
in
the
middle
and
all
the
rest
of
the
fun
events
of
the
provencal
fairs
night
was
falling
by
the
time
we
got
back
to
maillane
a
huge
bonfire
had
been
lit
in
the
square
in
front
of
the
café
where
mistral
and
his
friend
zidore
were
having
a
party
that
night
the
farandole
started
up
paper
lanterns
lit
up
everywhere
in
the
shadows
the
young
people
took
their
places
and
soon
after
a
trill
on
the
tambourines
a
wild
boisterous
round
dance
started
up
around
the
fire
it
was
a
dance
that
would
last
all
through
the
night
after
supper
and
too
tired
to
keep
going
we
went
into
modest
peasant
bedroom
with
two
double
beds
the
walls
are
bare
and
the
ceiling
beams
are
visible
four
years
ago
after
the
academy
had
given
the
author
of
a
prize
worth
three
thousand
francs
madame
mistral
had
an
idea
why
do
we
wallpaper
your
bedroom
and
put
a
ceiling
in
she
said
to
her
son
oh
no
replied
mistral
that
poet
money
that
is
and
not
to
be
touched
and
so
the
bedroom
stayed
strictly
bare
but
as
long
as
the
money
lasted
anyone
needy
knocking
on
mistral
door
has
always
found
his
purse
open
i
had
brought
the
notebook
with
into
the
bedroom
to
read
to
myself
a
passage
of
it
before
going
to
sleep
mistral
chose
the
episode
about
the
pottery
here
it
is
in
brief
it
is
during
a
meal
somewhere
or
another
a
magnificent
crockery
service
is
brought
out
and
placed
onto
the
table
at
the
bottom
of
every
plate
there
is
a
provencal
scene
painted
in
blue
on
the
enamel
the
whole
history
of
the
land
is
represented
on
them
each
plate
of
this
beautiful
crockery
has
its
own
verse
and
the
love
in
those
descriptions
just
has
to
be
seen
there
are
just
so
many
simple
but
clever
little
poems
done
with
all
the
charm
of
the
rural
idylls
of
theocritus
whilst
mistral
spoke
his
verses
in
this
beautiful
provencal
tongue
more
than
three
quarters
latin
and
once
spoken
by
queens
and
now
only
understood
by
shepherds
i
was
admiring
this
man
and
considering
the
ruinous
state
in
which
he
found
his
mother
tongue
and
what
he
had
done
with
it
i
was
also
imagining
one
of
those
old
palaces
of
the
princes
of
baux
which
can
be
seen
in
the
alpilles
there
were
no
more
roofs
no
stepped
balustrades
no
glass
in
the
windows
the
trefoils
broken
in
the
ribbed
vaults
and
the
coats
of
arms
on
the
doors
were
eaten
away
and
covered
in
moss
chickens
were
scratching
around
in
the
main
courtyard
pigs
were
wallowing
under
the
fine
columned
galleries
an
ass
was
grazing
in
the
chapel
overgrown
with
grass
and
pigeons
were
drinking
from
the
huge
filled
fonts
finally
amongst
the
rubble
two
or
three
peasant
families
had
built
huts
for
themselves
against
the
walls
of
the
old
palace
then
one
fine
day
the
son
of
one
the
peasants
develops
a
great
passion
for
the
grand
ruins
and
is
indignant
to
see
them
thus
profaned
quickly
he
chases
the
livestock
out
of
the
courtyard
and
the
muses
come
to
help
he
rebuilds
the
great
staircase
on
his
own
replaces
the
wood
panelling
on
the
walls
the
glass
in
the
windows
rebuilds
the
towers
the
throne
room
and
puts
the
immense
palace
where
popes
and
emperors
stayed
back
on
its
pediments
this
restored
palace
the
provencal
language
the
peasant
son

cruets
yes
reverend
i
have
put

in
the
cruets
but
i
assure
you

nothing
compared
with
what
you
will
want
to
drink
after
you
leave
midnight
mass
if
you
saw
what
was
in
the
chateau
dining
room
all
the
flaming
carafes
full
of
wine
of
all
types
and
the
silver
dishes
the
carved
centre
pieces
the
flowers
the
candelabras
no
one
will
ever
have
seen
a
christmas
dinner
like
this
one
the
marquis
has
invited
all
the
noble
lords
in
the
neighbourhood
there
be
at
least
forty
at
the
sitting
not
including
the
bailiff
and
the
scrivener
oh
you
are
really
lucky
to
be
among
their
number
reverend
there
nothing
like
sniffing
these
lovely
turkeys
the
smell
of
the
truffles
follows
me
around
mm
come
come
my
child
let
us
beware
of
the
sin
of
gluttony
especially
on
christmas
eve
hurry
up
light
the
candles
and
ring
the
first
bell
for
mass
as
midnight
is
upon
us
and
we
must
be
late
this
conversation
took
place
one
christmas
eve
in
the
year
of
our
lord
sixteen
hundred
and
god
knows
what
between
the
reverend
dom
balaguère
old
prior
of
the
barnabites
then
service
chaplain
of
the
sires
of
trinquelage
and
his
minor
cleric
garrigou
at
least
he
thought
it
was
his
minor
cleric
garrigou
for
as
you
may
know
that
night
the
devil
himself
took
on
the
round
face
and
bland
features
of
the
young
sacristan
in
order
to
tempt
the
reverend
father
into
the
terrible
sin
of
gluttony
so
as
the
garrigou
was
swinging
his
arms
to
ring
the
seigneurial
chapel
bells
the
reverend
managed
to
put
his
chasuble
back
on
in
the
small
chateau
sacristy
and
with
a
spirit
already
troubled
by
gastronomic
anticipation
he
excited
it
even
more
as
he
dressed
himself
by
going
over
the
menu
roast
turkeys
golden
carp
trout
as
fat
as
your
arm
outside
the
blew
and
broadcasted
the
music
of
the
bells
as
the
lights
began
to
appear
on
the
dark
side
of
mount
ventoux
surmounted
by
the
old
towers
of
the
trinquelage
tenant
families
were
walking
to
hear
midnight
mass
at
the
chateau
they
sang
as
they
climbed
the
hillside
in
small
groups
the
fathers
in
the
lead
holding
the
lantern
their
wives
wrapped
up
against
the
wind
in
large
brown
mantles
which
also
acted
as
a
shelter
for
the
children
when
they
snuggled
up
despite
the
dark
and
the
cold
all
these
brave
folk
walked
on
joyfully
sustained
by
the
thought
that
just
like
every
other
year
after
the
mass
there
would
be
a
table
stocked
up
for
them
in
the
kitchen
downstairs
during
the
hard
climb
a
lord
coach
with
its
leading
and
its
windows
shimmering
in
the
moonlight
occasionally
went
by
once
a
mule
with
bells
trotted
past
and
the
farmers
were
able
to
recognise
their
bailiff
by
the
light
of
their
lanterns
and
greeted
him
as
he
passed
good
evening
master
arnoton
good
evening
my
dears
the
night
was
clear
the
stars
seemed
intensified
by
the
cold
and
the
wind
was
stinging
very
fine
ice
crystals
slid
down
their
clothes
without
wetting
them
which
kept
up
the
tradition
of
a
white
christmas
at
the
very
top
of
the
hill
the
chateau
marked
the
end
of
their
journey
with
its
mass
of
towers
and
gables
the
chapel
clock
rose
into
a
dark
blue
sky
and
a
host
of
tiny
lights
flickered
in
and
out
at
every
window
in
the
murky
rear
of
the
building
and
looked
like
sparks
running
along
burning
paper
to
reach
the
chapel
after
crossing
the
drawbridge
and
passing
through
the
rear
entrance
you
had
to
cross
the
main
courtyard
full
of
coaches
valets
and
it
was
all
lit
up
by
the
fire
of
the
torches
and
flares
from
the
kitchens
which
was
also
the
source
of
a
squeaking
spit
clattering
saucepans
the
chink
of
crystal
and
silverware
shaken
about
during
the
laying
of
the
tables
and
a
warm
steam
smelling
deliciously
of
roast
meat
and
strong
herbs
in
fine
sauces
this
started
the
farmers
chaplain
bailiff
and
everybody
else
commenting
what
a
splendid
christmas
eve
dinner
there
is
in
store
for
us
ii
the
bell
rings
twice
midnight
mass
is
beginning
the
candles
are
lit
and
the
tapestries
draped
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
interleaved
arches
and
the
oak
panelling
in
the
chateau
chapel
it
a
veritable
cathedral
in
miniature
and
what
a
congregation
there
is
and
what
they
have
on
the
sire
of
trinquelage
is
dressed
in
taffeta
in
one
of
the
choir
sculptured
stalls
with
all
the
other
invited
noble
lords
sitting
near
him
opposite
on
a
pair
of
velvet
decorated
the
old
dowager
marquise
in
her
brocaded
dress
and
the
youthful
lady
of
trinquelage
hair
done
up
in
a
tower
of
crinkled
lace
in
the
latest
style
of
the
french
court
have
taken
their
places
and
lower
down
the
bailiff
thomas
arnoton
and
the
scrivener
master
ambroy
are
all
in
black
and
clean
shaven
with
huge
pointed
wigs
two
quiet
notes
amongst
the
loud
silks
and
brocaded
damasks
then
the
the
pages
the
stablemen
the
stewards
and
lady
barbe
with
all
her
keys
hanging
by
her
side
on
a
fine
silver
then
comes
the
lower
orders
on
benches
the
servants
the
and
their
families
lastly
the
male
servers
who
are
lined
up
against
the
door
quietly
half
opening
and
closing
it
again
as
they
pop
in
and
out
between
making
sauces
so
they
can
soak
up
a
bit
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
mass
as
they
do
this
a
whiff
of
christmas
eve
dinner
wafts
into
the
middle
of
the
service
already
warmed
by
so
many
lit
candles
is
it
the
sight
of
these
little
white
birettas
which
distracts
the
officiating
priest
it
more
likely
to
be
garrigou
with
his
persistent
little
bell
incessantly
ringing
on
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
with
infernal
urgency
as
if
to
say
hurry
up
hurry
up
the
sooner
we
finish
the
sooner
we
eat
the
simple
fact
is
that
with
each
tinkle
of
the
devilishly
insistent
bell
the
chaplain
loses
track
of
the
mass
as
his
mind
totally
wanders
off
into
the
christmas
eve
banquet
he
imagines
the
cooks
buzzing
around
the
blazing
furnaces
the
steam
hissing
from
lids
and
there
within
the
steam
two
magnificent
turkeys
stuffed
to
bursting
and
marbled
with
truffles
even
worse
he
imagines
the
lines
of
pages
carrying
dishes
that
breathe
out
the
tempting
vapour
and
accompanies
them
to
the
great
hall
already
prepared
for
the
great
feast
oh
such
delicacies
then
there
is
the
immense
table
fully
loaded
and
brimming
over
with
peacocks
still
covered
in
their
feathered
glory
pheasants
with
their
golden
brown
wings
spread
wide
the
ruby
coloured
flagons
of
wine
pyramids
of
fruit
begging
to
be
plucked
from
the
green
foliage
and
the
marvellous
fish
spread
out
on
a
bed
of
fennel
their
pearly
scales
shining
as
if
just
caught
with
a
bouquet
of
aromatic
herbs
in
the
gills
of
these
monsters
so
is
the
vision
of
these
marvels
that
dom
balaguère
has
the
impression
that
these
fabulous
dishes
were
served
on
the
embroidered
altar
cloth
so
that
instead
of
saying
lord
be
with
he
finds
himself
saying
these
slight
aside
he
reels
off
his
office
conscientiously
enough
without
fluffing
a
line
or
missing
a
genuflexion
all
went
well
to
the
end
of
the
first
mass
but
remember
the
celebrant
is
obliged
take
three
consecutive
masses
on
christmas
day
that
one
less
sighs
the
chaplain
to
himself
in
blessèd
relief
then
without
wasting
a
second
he
nodded
to
his
clerical
assistant
or
at
least
to
what
he
thought
was
his
clerical
assistant
and
the
bell
rang
again
the
second
mass
begins
and
with
it
the
fatal
fall
into
sin
of
dom
balaguère
quick
quick
let
hurry
up
cries
the
shrill
voice
of
bell
but
this
time
the
unlucky
celebrant
abandons
himself
utterly
to
the
demon
of
greed
and
pounces
on
the
missal
devouring
the
pages
as
he
lost
control
of
his
avidly
appetite
he
becomes
frenzied
he
bows
down
he
rises
takes
a
sight
stab
at
crossing
himself
and
genuflecting
minimising
the
gestures
all
the
quicker
to
reach
the
end
his
arms
no
sooner
stretched
over
the
gospels
than
back
thumping
his
chest
for
the
i
confess
competition
is
joined
between
him
and
his
cleric
to
see
who
finishes
first
in
the
mumbling
stakes
verses
and
responses
tumble
out
and
mix
together
half
swallowed
words
through
clenched
teeth
take
too
long
and
so
tail
off
into
incomprehensible
mutters
for
u
my
fau
like
frenzied
treading
the
grapes
from
the
vat
they
squelched
around
in
the
latin
of
the
mass
slopping
it
all
over
the
place
yo
says
balaguère
wi
yo
replies
garrigou
and
the
busy
little
bell
is
more
or
less
continuously
in
action
jangling
in
their
ears
acting
like
the
bells
they
put
on
to
make
them
gallop
faster
to
be
sure
at
this
rate
the
second
low
mass
is
quickly
dispatched
and
the
second
one
done
says
the
completely
breathless
chaplain
then
without
time
for
another
breath
flushed
and
sweating
he
rushes
down
the
altar
steps
and
the
bell
rings
yet
again
the
third
mass
is
beginning
the
dining
room
is
no
more
than
a
few
steps
away
but
oh
dear
as
the
christmas
eve
feast
gets
nearer
the
unfortunate
balaguère
is
gripped
by
a
mad
impatient
fever
of
greed
his
fantasies
get
the
worse
of
him
he
sees
the
golden
carp
the
roast
turkeys
they
are
there
there
right
before
his
eyes
he
touches
them
he
oh
god
the
steaming
dishes
the
scented
wine
then
the
little
bell
frantically
cries
out
faster
faster
faster
yet
how
could
he
go
any
faster
as
it
was
his
lips
barely
move
he
does
even
pronounce
the
words
short
of
completely
fooling
god
and
keeping
his
mass
from
him
and
then
he
even
falls
into
that
low
state
the
poor
unfortunate
man
going
from
bad
to
worse
temptation
he
begins
to
skip
a
verse
and
then
two
then
the
epistle
is
too
long
so
he
cuts
it
skims
over
the
gospel
reading
looks
in
at
the
i
believe
but
does
go
in
jumps
over
the
our
father
altogether
nods
at
the
preface
from
afar
and
goes
towards
eternal
damnation
by
leaps
and
bounds
he
was
closely
followed
by
the
infamous
satanic
garrigou
who
with
his
uncanny
understanding
as
number
two
lifts
up
his
chasuble
for
him
turns
the
pages
two
at
a
time
bumps
into
the
lecterns
knocks
off
birettas
and
ceaselessly
shakes
the
small
bell
harder
and
harder
faster
and
faster
those
present
are
completely
confused
obliged
to
base
their
actions
on
the
priest
words
not
one
of
which
they
understand
some
stand
up
while
others
kneel
sit
down
while
others
stand
the
christmas
star
yonder
on
its
journey
across
the
heavens
towards
the
stable
pales
in
horror
at
the
confusion
which
is
happening
the
father
is
going
too
quickly
we
ca
follow
him
murmurs
the
old
dowager
as
she
distractedly
plays
with
her
hair
master
arnoton
his
large
glasses
on
his
nose
looks
in
his
prayer
book
to
see
where
on
earth
they
might
be
in
the
service
at
heart
none
of
these
dear
people
who
are
also
thinking
of
the
feast
to
come
are
at
all
bothered
that
the
mass
is
going
at
such
a
rate
and
when
dom
balaguère
face
beaming
turns
towards
the
congregation
shouting
as
loud
as
possible
mass
is
it
is
as
with
one
voice
they
make
the
response
so
joyously
and
lively
there
in
the
chapel
you
would
think
that
they
are
already
sitting
at
the
table
for
the
opening
toast
of
the
christmas
eve
feast
iii
five
minutes
later
all
lords
with
the
chaplain
in
the
middle
are
seated
in
the
great
hall
everything
is
lit
up
in
the
chateau
which
resounded
with
singing
shouting
laughter
and
buzzing
the
venerable
dom
balaguère
is
plunging
his
fork
into
a
grouse
wing
and
drowning
his
sinful
remorse
under
a
sea
of
wine
and
meat
juices
the
poor
holy
man
eats
and
drinks
so
much
that
he
dies
in
the
night
suffering
a
terrible
heart
attack
with
no
time
to
repent
so
the
next
morning
he
arrives
in
a
heaven
full
of
rumours
about
the
night
revelries
and
i
leave
it
for
you
to
judge
how
he
is
received
depart
from
me
you
dismal
christian
the
sovereign
judge
our
lord
says
to
him
your
error
is
gross
enough
to
wipe
away
a
whole
life
of
virtue
ah
you
have
stolen
a
midnight
mass
from
me
oh
yes
you
did
you
will
pay
for
your
sin
three
hundred
times
over
in
the
proper
place
and
you
will
enter
paradise
only
when
you
will
have
celebrated
three
hundred
midnight
masses
in
your
own
chapel
in
front
of
all
those
who
have
sinned
with
you
through
your
most
grievous
fault
well
that
that
the
true
story
of
dom
balaguère
as
told
in
the
land
of
the
olive
the
chateau
of
trinquelage
is
no
more
but
the
chapel
still
remains
in
a
copse
of
green
oaks
at
the
top
of
mount
ventoux
now
it
has
a
ramshackle
door
and
grass
grows
over
the
threshold
there
are
birds
nests
in
the
corner
of
the
altar
and
in
the
window
openings
from
where
the
stained
glass
is
long
departed
however
it
is
said
that
every
year
at
christmas
a
supernatural
light
moves
amongst
the
ruins
and
when
the
peasants
go
to
the
mass
and
christmas
eve
meals
they
can
see
this
ghostly
chapel
lit
by
invisible
candles
which
burn
in
the
open
air
even
in
a
blizzard
laugh
if
you
will
but
a
winegrower
in
the
area
named
garrigue
no
doubt
a
descendant
of
garrigou
assures
me
that
once
when
he
was
a
bit
merry
at
christmas
he
got
lost
in
the
mountain
around
trinquelage
this
is
what
he
saw
until
eleven
at
night
nothing
everything
was
silent
dark
and
still
suddenly
towards
midnight
a
hand
bell
rang
at
the
very
top
of
the
clock
tower
it
was
an
ancient
bell
which
sounded
as
if
it
were
coming
from
far
away
soon
garrigue
saw
flickering
lights
making
vague
restless
shadows
on
the
road
under
the
chapel
porch
someone
was
walking
and
whispering
good
evening
master
arnoton
good
evening
good
evening
folks
when
everyone
had
gone
in
the
winegrower
a
very
brave
man
approached
carefully
and
looking
through
the
broken
door
was
met
by
a
very
strange
sight
indeed
all
the
people
whom
he
had
seen
pass
were
positioned
around
the
choir
in
the
ruined
nave
as
though
the
old
benches
were
still
there
there
were
beautiful
women
in
brocade
and
hair
lords
in
colourful
finery
from
head
to
toe
and
peasants
in
floral
jackets
like
those
our
grandfathers
used
to
wear
everything
gave
the
impression
of
being
old
dusty
faded
and
worn
out
sometimes
nocturnal
birds
regular
visitors
to
the
chapel
attracted
by
the
lights
came
to
flap
around
the
candles
whose
flame
went
straight
upwards
but
looked
dim
as
if
seen
through
gauze
there
was
a
certain
person
in
large
glasses
who
kept
shaking
his
tall
black
wig
where
one
of
the
birds
was
completely
entangled
its
wings
silently
thrashing
about
much
to
the
amusement
of
garrigue
deep
inside
a
little
old
man
with
a
childish
build
on
his
knees
in
the
middle
of
the
choir
was
desperately
and
soundlessly
shaking
a
hand
bell
while
a
priest
in
old
gold
vestments
was
coming
and
going
and
toing
and
froing
in
front
of
the
altar
and
saying
prayers
not
a
syllable
of
which
could
be
heard
it
was
dom
balaguère
of
course
in
the
middle
of
his
third
low
mass
the
oranges
a
fantasy
in
paris
oranges
have
the
sorrowful
look
of
windfalls
gathered
from
beneath
the
trees
at
the
time
they
get
to
you
in
the
dreary
middle
of
a
rainy
cold
winter
their
brilliant
skins
and
their
strong
perfume
or
so
they
seem
to
your
parisian
mediocre
tastes
imbue
them
with
a
foreign
flavour
a
hint
of
bohemia
throughout
the
foggy
afternoons
they
line
the
pavements
squashed
together
in
wheelbarrows
lit
by
the
low
light
of
lanterns
and
wrapped
in
red
paper
a
thin
repetitive
shout
of
valencian
oranges
two
sous
a
piece
accompanies
them
often
drowned
by
the
sound
of
cavorting
carriages
and
boisterous
buses
for
most
parisians
this
fruit
gathered
far
away
and
unremarkably
round
with
just
a
clipping
of
greenery
from
the
tree
reminds
them
of
sweets
and
desserts
the
tissue
they
wrapped
in
and
the
parties
at
which
they
make
their
appearance
add
to
this
impression
come
january
thousands
of
oranges
are
on
the
streets
and
their
discarded
skins
are
in
the
muddy
gutters
everywhere
looking
as
though
some
giant
christmas
tree
had
shaken
its
branches
of
artificial
fruit
all
over
paris
there
just
about
nowhere
free
of
oranges
they
are
in
the
carefully
arranged
shop
windows
sorted
and
prepared
outside
prison
and
hospital
gates
among
the
packets
of
biscuits
and
the
stacks
of
apples
and
in
front
of
entrances
to
dances
and
sunday
street
shows
their
exquisite
perfume
mixes
variously
with
the
smell
of
gas
the
noise
of
old
violins
and
the
dust
in
the
gods
at
the
theatre
it
easy
to
forget
that
it
takes
orange
trees
to
make
oranges
for
when
the
fruit
arrives
from
the
midi
by
their
thousands
of
boxfuls
the
tree
itself
pruned
and
unrecognisable
is
hidden
in
a
warm
greenhouse
for
the
winter
and
makes
only
a
brief
summer
appearance
in
public
gardens
in
paris
to
really
appreciate
oranges
you
have
to
see
them
in
their
natural
setting
in
the
balearics
sardinia
corsica
and
algeria
in
the
sunny
blue
skies
of
the
warm
mediterranean
i
can
recall
with
great
pleasure
a
small
orchard
of
orange
trees
at
the
gates
of
blidah
just
such
a
place
where
their
true
beauty
could
be
seen
amongst
the
dark
glossy
lustred
leaves
the
fruits
had
the
brilliance
of
stained
glass
windows
and
perfumed
the
air
all
around
with
the
same
magnificent
aura
that
usually
envelops
gorgeous
flowers
here
and
there
gaps
in
the
branches
revealed
the
ramparts
of
the
little
town
the
minaret
of
a
mosque
the
dome
of
a
marabout
and
towering
above
the
immense
atlas
mountains
green
at
the
base
and
with
drifts
of
snow
here
and
there
one
night
during
my
stay
a
strange
phenomenon
not
seen
for
thirty
years
occurred
the
ice
from
the
freezing
zone
descended
onto
the
sleeping
village
and
blidah
woke
up
transformed
and
powdered
in
white
snow
in
the
light
pure
algerian
air
the
snow
looked
like
the
finest
dusting
of
mother
of
pearl
and
had
the
lustre
of
a
white
feather
but
it
was
the
orange
orchard
that
was
the
most
beautiful
thing
to
be
seen
the
firm
leaves
kept
the
snow
intact
and
upright
like
sorbets
on
a
lacquered
plate
and
all
the
fruits
powdered
over
with
frost
had
a
wonderful
mellowness
a
discrete
radiance
like
gold
it
was
all
vaguely
evocative
of
a
church
saint
day
the
red
cassocks
under
the
lacy
robes
and
the
gilt
on
a
lace
altar
cloth
but
my
most
treasured
memories
concerning
oranges
come
from
barbicaglia
a
large
garden
close
to
ajaccio
where
i
was
about
to
have
a
siesta
in
the
hottest
time
of
the
day
the
orange
trees
were
taller
and
further
apart
than
in
blidah
and
reached
down
to
the
road
behind
a
ditched
hedge
immediately
beyond
the
road
there
was
the
deep
blue
sea
i
have
had
such
happy
times
in
that
orchard
the
orange
trees
in
flower
and
in
fruit
spread
their
delightful
perfume
around
occasionally
a
ripe
orange
would
fall
and
drop
to
the
ground
near
me
with
a
dull
thud
and
i
just
had
to
stretch
out
my
hand
they
were
superb
fruit
with
their
purple
flesh
inside
and
looked
exquisite
toning
in
with
the
surrounding
stunning
scenery
between
the
leaves
the
sea
was
seen
in
dazzling
blue
patches
like
shattered
glass
sparkling
in
the
sea
mist
the
sea
disturbed
the
atmosphere
far
away
and
caused
a
rhythmic
murmur
that
soothed
like
being
on
a
boat
oh
the
heat
and
the
smell
of
oranges
it
was
just
so
very
refreshing
to
sleep
in
that
orchard
at
barbicaglia
sometimes
however
at
the
height
of
the
siesta
a
would
wake
me
up
with
a
start
the
boys
of
the
military
band
came
over
there
to
practice
on
the
road
through
the
gaps
in
the
hedge
i
could
see
the
brass
decoration
on
the
drums
and
the
white
aprons
on
their
red
trousers
the
poor
devils
came
into
what
little
shade
was
offered
by
the
hedge
to
hide
for
a
while
from
the
blinding
light
pitilessly
reflected
from
the
dust
on
the
road
and
they
played
on
until
they
became
very
very
hot
i
forced
myself
from
my
state
and
amused
myself
by
throwing
them
some
of
the
golden
red
fruit
that
i
could
easily
reach
my
target
drummer
stopped
there
was
a
short
pause
as
he
looked
around
for
the
source
of
this
superb
orange
rolling
into
the
ditch
beside
him
before
snatching
it
up
and
taking
a
grateful
mouthful
without
even
bothering
to
peel
it
right
next
to
barbicaglia
over
a
low
wall
i
overlooked
a
small
strange
garden
of
an
italianate
design
in
a
small
plot
of
land
its
paths
bordered
by
bright
green
box
trees
and
two
cypress
trees
guarding
the
entrance
gave
it
the
look
of
a
marseille
country
seat
there
was
no
shade
whatsoever
at
the
far
end
there
was
a
white
stone
building
with
skylight
windows
on
the
ground
floor
at
first
i
thought
it
was
a
country
house
but
on
closer
inspection
i
noticed
a
cross
on
the
roof
and
a
carved
inscription
in
the
stone
which
i
could
make
out
from
here
i
knew
then
that
it
was
a
corsican
family
tomb
these
little
mausoleums
can
be
seen
all
around
ajaccio
and
surrounded
by
a
garden
the
families
go
there
on
sundays
to
visit
their
dead
a
setting
like
that
gives
death
a
less
gloomy
air
than
the
confusion
of
cemeteries
and
there
is
only
the
footsteps
of
friends
to
disturb
the
silence
from
where
i
was
i
could
see
an
old
chap
shuffling
calmly
around
the
paths
all
day
long
he
trimmed
the
trees
dug
the
ground
over
and
watered
and
the
flowers
with
great
care
at
sunset
he
went
into
the
small
chapel
where
the
family
dead
lay
to
put
away
the
spade
the
rakes
and
the
large
watering
cans
while
displaying
all
the
respectful
tranquillity
and
serenity
of
a
cemetery
gardener
the
man
worked
with
a
certain
subliminal
reverence
and
always
locked
the
vault
door
quietly
as
if
wary
of
waking
somebody
within
its
great
and
glorious
silence
the
upkeep
of
this
little
garden
troubled
no
one
and
did
by
any
means
depress
the
neighbourhood
in
fact
only
the
immense
sea
and
the
infinite
sky
had
more
grandeur
this
everlasting
siesta
surrounded
as
it
was
by
the
overwhelming
sights
and
forces
of
nature
brought
a
sense
of
eternal
repose
to
everything
in
sight
the
two
inns
i
was
on
my
way
back
from
nîmes
one
crushingly
hot
afternoon
in
july
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
the
white
blistering
road
was
turning
to
clouds
of
dust
between
olive
groves
and
small
oaks
under
a
great
silver
hazy
sun
which
filled
the
whole
sky
not
a
trace
of
shade
not
a
whisper
of
wind
nothing
except
the
shimmering
of
the
hot
air
and
the
strident
cry
of
the
cicadas
incessant
din
deafening
hurried
and
seeming
to
harmonise
with
the
immense
luminous
shimmering
i
had
walked
for
two
hours
in
this
desert
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
when
suddenly
a
group
of
white
houses
emerged
from
the
dust
cloud
in
the
road
in
front
of
me
they
were
known
as
the
coaching
inns
five
or
six
farms
with
long
red
roofed
barns
and
a
dried
up
watering
hole
in
a
oasis
of
spindly
fig
trees
at
the
end
of
the
village
two
large
inns
faced
each
other
across
the
road
there
was
something
striking
about
these
inns
and
their
strange
setting
on
one
side
there
was
a
large
new
building
full
of
life
and
buzzing
with
activity
all
the
doors
were
ajar
a
coach
was
in
front
from
which
the
steaming
horses
were
being
unhitched
the
disembarked
passengers
were
hurriedly
drinking
in
the
partial
shade
by
the
walls
there
was
a
courtyard
strewn
with
mules
and
wagons
and
the
wagoners
were
lying
down
under
the
outhouses
waiting
to
feel
cool
inside
there
was
the
jumbled
sound
of
shouting
swearing
fists
banging
on
the
tables
glasses
clinking
billiard
balls
rattling
lemonade
corks
popping
and
above
all
that
racket
a
joyful
voice
bursting
with
song
loud
enough
to
shake
the
windows
the
lovely
margoton
just
as
soon
as
night
was
day
took
her
little
silver
can
to
the
river
made
her
away
the
inn
on
the
other
side
was
silent
and
looked
completely
abandoned
there
was
grass
under
the
gate
broken
blinds
and
a
branch
of
dead
holly
on
the
door
all
that
was
left
of
an
old
decoration
the
entrance
steps
were
supported
by
stones
from
the
road
it
was
so
poor
and
pitiful
that
it
was
a
real
act
of
charity
to
stop
there
at
all
even
for
a
drink
as
i
went
in
i
saw
a
long
gloomy
deserted
room
with
daylight
bursting
in
through
three
large
curtainless
windows
which
just
made
it
look
even
more
deserted
and
gloomy
there
were
some
unsteady
tables
with
glasses
long
abandoned
on
them
there
was
also
a
broken
billiard
table
which
held
out
its
six
pockets
like
begging
bowls
a
yellow
couch
and
an
old
bar
all
slumbering
on
in
the
heavy
unhealthy
heat
and
the
flies
oh
god
the
flies
i
have
never
seen
so
many
they
were
on
the
ceiling
stuck
to
the
windows
in
the
glasses
in
clusters
everywhere
when
i
opened
the
door
there
was
a
buzzing
as
if
i
had
just
entered
a
bee
hive
at
the
back
of
the
room
in
a
window
there
was
a
woman
standing
her
face
pressed
against
the
glass
and
totally
absorbed
in
looking
through
it
i
called
to
her
twice
hello
landlady
she
turned
round
slowly
and
revealed
a
pitiful
peasant
face
wrinkled
cracked
earth
coloured
and
framed
in
long
strands
of
brownish
lace
like
old
women
wear
hereabouts
and
yet
she
was
an
old
woman
perhaps
the
tears
had
wilted
her
what
can
i
do
for
you
she
asked
me
drying
her
eyes
just
a
sit
down
and
a
drink
she
looked
at
me
utterly
astonished
and
did
move
as
if
she
understood
this
is
an
inn
is
it
the
woman
sighed
yes
it
an
inn
in
a
manner
of
speaking
but
why
are
you
over
the
road
like
everybody
else
it
a
much
livelier
place
it
a
bit
too
lively
for
my
liking
i
rather
stay
here
and
without
waiting
for
her
reply
i
sat
down
at
a
table
once
she
had
satisfied
herself
that
i
was
genuine
she
began
to
flit
to
and
fro
busily
opening
drawers
moving
bottles
wiping
glasses
and
flicking
the
flies
away
you
could
see
that
a
customer
was
quite
an
event
for
her
now
and
then
the
unfortunate
woman
would
hold
her
head
as
if
she
was
despairing
of
getting
to
the
end
of
it
then
she
disappeared
into
a
back
room
i
heard
her
take
up
some
keys
fiddle
with
the
locks
rummage
in
the
bread
bin
huff
and
puff
do
some
dusting
wash
some
plates
and
from
time
to
time
a
muffled
sob
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
this
performance
a
plate
of
dried
raisins
an
old
beaucaire
loaf
as
hard
as
the
dish
it
came
on
and
a
bottle
of
cheap
wine
were
placed
before
me
there
you
are
said
the
strange
creature
and
rushed
back
to
her
place
at
the
window
i
tried
to
engage
her
in
conversation
as
i
was
drinking
up
you
do
often
get
people
here
do
you
madam
oh
no
monsieur
never
no
one
it
was
very
different
at
the
time
when
we
were
the
only
the
coaching
inn
around
here
we
did
the
lunches
for
the
hunt
during
the
soter
bird
season
as
well
as
coaches
all
the
year
round
but
since
the
other
place
has
opened
up
lost
everything
the
world
and
his
wife
prefer
to
go
across
the
way
they
find
it
just
too
miserable
here
the
simple
fact
is
that
this
place
does
interest
them
i
not
beautiful
i
have
prickly
heat
and
my
two
little
girls
are
dead
over
there
it
very
different
there
is
laughter
all
the
time
a
woman
from
arles
a
beautiful
woman
with
lots
of
lace
and
three
gold
chains
round
her
neck
keeps
the
place
the
driver
her
lover
brings
in
customers
for
her
in
the
coach
she
also
has
a
number
of
attractive
girls
for
chamber
maids
this
also
brings
lots
of
business
in
she
gets
all
the
young
people
from
bezouces
from
redessan
and
from
jonquières
the
coachmen
go
out
of
their
way
to
call
in
at
her
place
as
for
me
i
stuck
in
here
all
day
all
alone
eating
my
heart
out
she
said
all
that
with
a
distracted
vacant
way
forehead
still
pressed
against
the
window
pane
obviously
there
was
something
in
the
inn
opposite
that
really
interested
her
suddenly
over
the
road
a
lot
started
to
happen
the
coach
edged
forward
in
the
dust
the
sounds
of
cracking
whips
and
a
horn
was
heard
the
young
girls
squeezed
together
in
the
doorway
and
shouted
goodbye
goodbye
and
above
all
that
the
wonderful
voice
singing
as
before
most
beautifully
took
her
little
silver
can
to
the
river
made
her
way
she
did
notice
by
the
water
three
young
cavaliers
quite
near
the
woman
whole
body
shook
on
hearing
that
voice
and
she
turned
towards
me
and
whispered
do
you
hear
that
that
my
husband
do
you
think
he
has
a
beautiful
voice
i
looked
at
her
stupefied
what
your
husband
so
even
he
goes
over
there
then
with
an
apologetic
air
but
movingly
she
said
what
can
you
do
monsieur
men
are
like
that
they
do
like
tears
and
i
always
breaking
down
since
our
little
girls
died
then
this
dump
of
a
place
where
nobody
comes
is
so
miserable
well
then
when
he
gets
really
fed
up
my
poor
dear
josé
goes
over
the
road
for
a
drink
and
the
woman
from
arles
gets
him
to
sing
with
that
gorgeous
voice
of
his
hush
there
he
goes
again
and
trembling
and
with
huge
tears
that
made
her
look
even
more
ugly
she
stood
there
in
front
of
the
window
hands
held
out
in
ecstasy
listening
to
her
josé
singing
to
the
woman
from
arles
the
first
was
bold
and
whispered
to
her
you
so
beautiful
my
dear
at
milianah
from
the
this
time
i
am
going
to
take
you
away
to
spend
a
day
a
very
long
way
from
the
windmill
in
a
pretty
little
algerian
town
it
will
be
a
nice
change
from
the
tambourines
and
cicadas
there
rain
in
the
air
the
sky
is
grey
the
crests
of
mount
zaccar
are
enveloped
in
fog
it
a
miserable
sunday
i
in
my
small
hotel
room
lighting
one
cigarette
after
another
just
trying
to
take
my
mind
off
things
the
hotel
library
has
been
put
at
my
disposal
i
find
an
odd
volume
of
montaigne
between
a
detailed
history
of
hotel
registrations
and
a
few
paul
de
kock
novels
opening
it
at
random
i
the
admirable
essay
on
the
death
of
la
boétie
so
now
i
more
dreamy
and
gloomy
than
ever
a
few
drops
of
rain
are
starting
to
fall
each
one
leaving
a
large
star
in
the
dust
accumulated
on
the
windowsill
since
last
year
rain
the
book
slips
out
of
my
hands
as
i
stare
hypnotically
at
the
melancholy
star
for
some
time
the
town
clock
strikes
two
on
an
old
whose
slender
high
white
walls
i
can
see
from
here
poor
old
marabout
thirty
years
ago
who
would
have
thought
that
one
day
it
would
have
a
big
municipal
dial
stuck
in
its
solar
plexus
and
on
sundays
on
the
stroke
of
two
it
would
give
a
lead
to
the
churches
of
milianah
to
sound
their
bells
for
vespers
there
they
go
now
ringing
away
and
not
for
a
brief
spell
either
without
doubt
this
room
is
a
miserable
place
the
huge
dawn
spinners
known
as
philosopher
thought
spiders
have
spun
their
webs
everywhere
i
going
out
i
on
the
main
square
now
just
the
place
for
the
military
band
of
the
third
division
not
put
off
by
a
bit
of
rain
which
has
just
arranged
itself
around
the
conductor
the
brigade
general
appears
at
one
of
the
division
windows
surrounded
by
his
fancy
women
the
is
on
the
square
and
walks
to
and
fro
on
the
arm
of
the
justice
of
the
peace
half
a
dozen
young
arabs
stripped
to
the
waist
are
playing
marbles
in
a
corner
to
the
sound
of
their
own
ferocious
shouting
elsewhere
an
old
jew
in
rags
comes
to
look
for
a
ray
of
sunshine
he
left
here
yesterday
and
looks
astonished
not
to
find
it
one
two
three
the
band
launched
into
an
old
talexian
mazurka
which
barbary
organs
used
to
play
irritatingly
under
my
window
last
year
but
it
moved
me
to
tears
today
oh
how
happy
are
these
musicians
of
the
third
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
dotted
crochets
drunk
on
rhythm
and
noise
only
conscious
of
counting
beats
their
whole
being
was
in
that
bit
of
paper
vibrating
in
brass
prongs
at
the
end
of
their
instruments
one
two
three
they
have
everything
they
need
these
fine
men
except
they
never
play
the
national
anthem
it
makes
them
home
sick
alas
i
have
much
of
a
musical
ear
and
this
piece
irritates
me
so
i
off
now
where
on
earth
would
i
be
able
to
have
a
nice
time
on
a
grey
sunday
like
this
i
know
shop
is
open
i
going
there
he
may
have
a
shop
but
he
is
no
shopkeeper
he
is
a
prince
of
the
blood
line
the
son
of
a
former
dey
of
algeria
who
was
strangled
to
death
by
turkish
soldiers
when
his
father
was
killed
he
sought
refuge
in
milianah
with
his
adored
mother
he
lived
there
for
several
years
like
a
fine
gentleman
philosopher
with
his
greyhounds
falcons
horses
and
wives
in
this
attractive
and
refreshing
palace
amongst
the
orange
trees
and
fountains
then
the
french
came
we
came
was
our
enemy
at
first
and
allied
himself
with
but
then
he
fell
out
with
the
emir
and
surrendered
to
us
while
was
away
from
milianah
the
emir
took
revenge
by
pillaging
his
palace
he
flattened
his
orange
trees
made
off
with
his
horses
and
wives
and
killed
his
mother
cruelly
crushing
her
throat
under
the
lid
of
a
large
chest
anger
knew
no
bounds
within
the
hour
he
had
enrolled
himself
in
the
french
army
and
we
had
no
better
fiercer
soldier
for
as
long
as
our
war
with
the
emir
lasted
returned
to
milianah
but
even
today
at
the
merest
mention
of
he
grows
pale
and
his
eyes
light
up
is
sixty
now
and
despite
his
age
and
the
smallpox
his
face
has
stayed
rather
handsome
he
has
long
eyelashes
with
an
appealing
look
and
a
charming
smile
very
the
war
ruined
him
and
all
he
has
left
of
his
former
opulence
is
a
farm
in
the
plain
of
chélif
and
a
house
in
milianah
where
he
lives
a
bourgeois
life
with
his
three
sons
who
are
being
brought
up
under
his
aegis
the
local
bigwigs
hold
him
in
some
veneration
if
a
dispute
breaks
out
they
are
only
too
happy
to
let
him
arbitrate
and
his
judgement
usually
carries
the
weight
of
law
he
seldom
goes
out
you
can
usually
find
him
every
afternoon
next
door
in
a
shop
which
opens
onto
the
road
it
is
not
opulently
furnished
the
walls
are
whitewashed
and
there
are
a
circular
wooden
bench
cushions
long
pipes
and
two
braziers
this
is
where
gives
his
audiences
and
dispenses
justice
hey
solomon
in
a
shop
today
is
sunday
and
there
is
a
good
turn
out
a
dozen
leaders
each
in
their
burnous
are
squatting
all
around
the
room
a
large
pipe
and
small
fine
filigreed
eggcup
full
of
coffee
to
hand
i
go
in
nobody
moves
from
where
he
is
gives
me
his
most
charming
smile
by
way
of
a
greeting
and
beckons
me
to
sit
next
to
him
on
a
large
yellow
silk
cushion
he
puts
a
finger
to
his
mouth
to
indicate
that
i
should
listen
the
case
is
between
the
leader
of
the
and
a
jew
from
milianah
who
are
having
a
dispute
about
a
plot
of
land
the
two
parties
had
agreed
to
put
their
differences
to
and
to
abide
by
his
judgement
the
meeting
is
set
for
this
very
day
and
the
witnesses
are
assembled
surprisingly
it
is
my
jew
and
he
is
having
second
thoughts
and
has
come
alone
without
witnesses
declaring
that
he
would
prefer
to
rely
on
the
judgement
of
a
french
justice
of
the
peace
than
on
that
was
where
things
stood
when
i
arrived
the
jew
old
greying
beard
brown
jacket
blue
stockings
and
velvet
cap
raises
his
eyes
to
the
sky
and
rolls
them
kisses
silk
slippers
bows
his
head
kneels
down
and
clasps
his
hands
together
pleadingly
i
have
no
arabic
but
from
the
jew
miming
and
from
the
words
of
the
peace
joustees
of
the
which
he
keeps
repeating
i
get
the
gist
of
what
he
is
saying
i
have
no
doubts
about
is
wise
is
just
but
the
joustees
of
the
peace
would
be
more
suitable
for
our
business
the
audience
is
indignant
and
yet
remains
impassive
as
arabs
do
stretched
out
on
his
cushion
his
eyes
blurred
the
amber
book
to
his
lips
that
master
of
irony
smiles
as
he
listens
suddenly
at
the
height
of
his
pleas
the
jew
is
interrupted
by
an
energetic
which
stops
him
dead
the
voice
belongs
to
a
spanish
colonial
who
has
come
as
a
witness
for
the
leader
and
who
then
leaves
his
place
and
approaches
the
judas
jew
and
pours
a
bucketful
of
imprecations
in
all
tongues
and
shades
of
blue
over
his
head
mixed
with
other
french
expressions
too
gross
to
repeat
son
who
understands
french
reddened
on
hearing
such
words
in
front
of
his
father
and
leaves
keeping
up
an
arabic
tradition
the
audience
is
still
impassive
still
smiling
on
the
jew
stands
up
and
backs
towards
the
door
trembling
and
scared
and
babbles
on
about
his
everlasting
of
the
peas
joustees
of
the
he
leaves
the
spaniard
furious
is
at
his
heels
and
meets
up
with
him
in
the
road
before
hitting
him
twice
full
in
the
face
the
jew
falls
to
his
knees
with
his
arms
covering
his
face
the
spaniard
a
little
ashamed
of
himself
comes
back
into
the
shop
as
soon
as
he
is
safely
inside
the
jew
gets
up
with
a
shifty
look
at
the
motley
crowd
surrounding
him
there
were
people
of
many
races
and
colours
there
maltese
minorcans
negroes
and
arabs
all
united
for
once
in
hating
the
jew
and
loving
to
see
him
so
maltreated
the
jew
hesitates
a
while
then
grabs
an
arab
by
his
burnous
you
saw
him
achmed
you
saw
him
you
were
there
the
christian
hit
me
you
shall
be
a
witness
yes
yes
you
shall
be
a
witness
the
arab
frees
his
burnous
and
pushes
the
jew
away
he
knows
nothing
he
seen
nothing
he
was
looking
the
other
way
how
about
you
kaddour
you
saw
him
you
saw
the
christian
strike
me
shouts
my
unfortunate
jew
to
a
big
negro
who
is
impassively
peeling
a
barbary
fig
the
negro
spits
his
contempt
and
moves
away
he
has
seen
a
thing
neither
has
the
little
maltese
whose
eyes
glisten
viciously
under
his
biretta
nor
the
girl
from
mahon
who
placing
a
basket
of
pomegranates
on
her
head
laughs
it
all
and
him
off
no
matter
how
much
the
jew
shouts
pleads
demeans
himself
no
witnesses
nobody
saw
anything
by
chance
just
then
a
couple
of
fellow
zionists
pass
by
they
are
humiliated
and
cower
by
a
wall
the
jew
spots
them
quick
quick
brothers
quick
to
the
consultant
quick
to
the
of
the
the
rest
of
you
you
saw
him
you
saw
him
beat
the
old
man
up
as
if
they
seen
him
i
do
think
so
things
are
getting
lively
in
old
shop
the
proprietor
refills
their
cups
and
relights
their
pipes
they
chat
on
and
they
laugh
fit
to
burst
it
such
a
pleasure
to
see
a
jew
beaten
up
in
the
middle
of
the
hubbub
and
smoke
i
slip
out
quietly
i
want
to
wander
in
the
jewish
quarter
to
see
how
my
jew
coreligionists
are
taking
their
brother
outrage
come
to
dinner
tonight
the
good
old
shouted
i
agree
and
thank
him
i
go
outside
in
the
jewish
quarter
there
is
turmoil
the
matter
has
already
attracted
a
lot
of
attention
nobody
is
minding
the
store
embroiderers
tailors
and
saddlers
all
israel
is
out
on
the
street
the
men
in
their
velvet
caps
and
blue
woollen
stockings
fidgeting
noisily
in
groups
the
women
pale
bloated
and
unattractive
in
their
thin
dresses
and
gold
fronts
have
their
faces
wrapped
in
black
bandages
and
are
going
from
group
to
group
caterwauling
as
i
arrive
something
starts
to
move
in
the
crowd
there
an
urgency
and
a
crush
relying
on
their
witness
my
jew
hero
of
the
hour
passes
between
two
rows
of
caps
under
a
hail
of
exhortations
revenge
yourself
brother
revenge
us
revenge
the
jewish
people
fear
nothing
you
have
the
law
on
your
side
a
hideous
dwarf
smelling
of
pitch
and
old
leather
comes
to
me
pitifully
sighing
deeply
you
see
he
said
to
me
we
hard
done
by
we
jews
how
they
treat
us
he
an
old
man
look
they
practically
killed
him
it
true
my
poor
jew
looks
more
dead
than
alive
he
goes
past
me
his
eyes
lifeless
his
face
haggard
not
so
much
walking
as
dragging
himself
along
only
a
huge
compensation
looks
likely
to
make
him
feel
any
better
after
all
he
is
going
to
the
consultant
not
to
the
doctor
there
are
almost
as
many
consultants
in
algeria
as
there
are
grasshoppers
it
a
good
living
i
say
in
any
case
it
has
the
great
advantage
that
you
can
just
walk
into
it
without
passing
examinations
or
leaving
a
bond
or
being
trained
in
paris
you
become
a
lawyer
in
algeria
a
consultant
it
enough
to
have
a
bit
of
french
spanish
and
arabian
and
to
have
a
code
of
conduct
in
your
saddle
bag
but
above
all
else
you
need
the
right
temperament
for
the
job
the
agent
functions
are
very
varied
he
can
be
in
turn
a
barrister
solicitor
broker
expert
interpreter
money
dealer
commissioner
and
public
scribe
he
is
the
jack
of
all
trades
of
the
colony
only
harpagon
has
a
single
jack
of
all
trades
the
rest
of
the
colony
has
a
surfeit
and
nowhere
more
than
milianah
where
they
can
be
counted
in
dozens
usually
to
avoid
office
expenses
these
gentlemen
meet
their
clients
in
the
café
in
the
main
square
and
give
their
consultations
did
i
say
give
between
the
appetiser
and
the
after
dinner
wine
the
dignified
jew
is
making
his
way
towards
the
café
in
the
main
square
with
the
two
witnesses
at
his
side
i
will
leave
them
to
it
as
i
leave
the
jewish
quarter
i
go
past
the
arab
bureau
from
outside
with
its
slate
grey
roof
and
french
flag
flying
above
it
could
be
taken
for
the
village
town
hall
i
know
the
interpreter
so
i
go
in
and
have
a
cigarette
with
him
in
between
fags
this
sunless
sunday
has
turned
out
quite
well
the
yard
in
front
of
the
bureau
is
packed
with
shabbily
dressed
arabs
fifteen
of
them
in
their
burnouses
are
squatting
there
along
the
wall
turning
it
into
a
sort
of
lobby
this
bedouin
area
despite
being
in
the
open
air
gives
off
a
very
strong
smell
of
human
flesh
moving
quickly
past
i
find
the
interpreter
occupied
with
two
large
arabs
quite
naked
under
their
filthy
blankets
madly
miming
some
story
or
other
about
a
stolen
chain
i
sit
down
on
a
mat
in
a
corner
and
look
on
the
milianah
interpreter
uniform
is
very
fetching
and
how
well
he
carries
it
they
are
made
for
each
other
the
uniform
is
sky
blue
with
black
frogging
and
shiny
gold
buttons
with
fair
tightly
curled
hair
and
a
he
cuts
a
fine
figure
this
hussar
in
blue
and
is
full
of
fun
and
strange
tales
he
is
naturally
talkative
he
speaks
many
languages
and
is
a
bit
of
a
religious
sceptic
he
knew
renan
at
the
oriental
school
a
great
amateur
sportsman
he
is
equally
at
ease
in
an
arab
tent
or
at
the
soirées
he
dances
the
mazurka
as
well
as
anyone
and
makes
couscous
better
than
anyone
to
sum
up
he
a
parisian
and
my
sort
of
man
no
wonder
the
women
are
mad
about
him
he
is
a
sharp
dresser
and
only
the
arab
bureau
sergeant
is
in
the
same
league
the
sergeant
who
with
his
uniform
of
fine
material
and
mother
of
pearl
buttoned
leggings
causes
envy
and
despair
in
the
garrison
our
man
is
on
attachment
to
the
bureau
and
he
is
excused
fatigues
and
is
often
seen
in
the
streets
white
gloved
his
hair
freshly
curled
and
large
files
under
his
arm
he
is
admired
and
he
is
feared
he
is
authoritative
to
be
sure
this
story
of
the
stolen
chain
threatens
to
become
an
epic
i
sha
wait
for
the
end
the
bureau
area
is
in
uproar
as
i
leave
the
crowd
is
crushing
round
a
tall
pale
proud
local
man
dressed
in
a
black
burnous
a
week
ago
this
man
fought
a
panther
in
the
zaccar
the
panther
is
dead
but
the
man
has
lost
half
his
left
arm
in
the
morning
and
at
night
he
comes
to
have
his
wounds
dressed
at
the
bureau
and
every
time
he
is
stopped
in
the
yard
and
has
to
his
story
he
speaks
slowly
with
beautifully
guttural
voice
from
time
to
time
he
pulls
his
burnous
to
one
side
and
shows
his
left
arm
strapped
to
his
chest
and
wrapped
in
bloody
blankets
the
moment
i
come
into
the
street
a
violent
storm
breaks
rain
thunder
lightning
sirocco
quickly
i
take
shelter
in
the
first
available
doorway
and
fall
amongst
a
bunch
of
bohemians
crowded
into
the
archways
of
a
moorish
courtyard
it
adjoins
the
milianah
mosque
and
is
a
regular
refuge
for
the
muslim
destitute
they
call
it
the
of
the
large
emaciated
lousy
and
threatening
greyhounds
range
around
me
backed
up
against
the
gallery
pillars
i
try
to
keep
control
of
myself
and
do
talk
to
anyone
as
i
try
to
look
unconcernedly
at
the
rain
bouncing
off
the
flagstones
the
bohemians
are
lying
about
carelessly
close
by
me
is
a
young
woman
almost
beautiful
with
her
breasts
and
legs
uncovered
and
thick
iron
bracelets
on
her
wrists
and
ankles
she
is
singing
a
strange
tune
consisting
of
three
melancholic
nasal
notes
while
she
is
breast
feeding
a
naked
child
and
fills
a
mortar
with
barley
with
her
free
arm
the
rain
sometimes
soaks
the
arms
of
the
nursing
woman
and
the
body
of
the
child
the
bohemian
girl
completely
ignores
this
and
keeps
singing
during
the
gusts
while
still
piling
up
the
barley
and
giving
suck
the
storm
abates
and
gives
me
a
chance
to
leave
the
courtyard
of
miracles
and
make
my
way
towards
dinner
at
now
imminent
as
i
cross
the
main
square
i
run
into
my
jew
of
recent
memory
again
he
is
leaning
on
his
consultant
his
witnesses
are
following
happily
behind
him
and
a
bunch
of
naughty
little
jewish
boys
skip
around
him
they
are
all
beaming
the
consultant
is
taking
charge
of
the
affair
he
will
ask
for
two
thousand
francs
compensation
from
the
tribunal
dinner
at
is
sumptuous
the
dining
room
opens
onto
a
moorish
courtyard
where
two
or
three
fountains
are
playing
it
an
excellent
turkish
meal
whose
highlights
are
aux
amandes
couscous
à
la
and
à
la
a
bit
heavy
but
a
gourmet
meal
nevertheless
and
biscuits
made
with
honey
called
du
for
wine
nothing
but
champagne
managed
to
drink
some
despite
muslim
law
while
the
servers
were
looking
away
after
dinner
we
go
into
our
host
room
where
we
are
served
with
sweetmeats
pipes
and
coffee
the
furnishings
of
this
room
are
sparse
a
divan
several
mats
and
a
large
high
bed
at
the
back
scattered
with
gold
embroidered
red
cushions
a
turkish
painting
of
the
exploits
of
a
certain
hamadi
hangs
upon
the
wall
turkish
painters
only
seem
to
use
one
colour
per
canvas
this
canvas
is
decidedly
green
the
sea
the
sky
the
ships
even
the
admiral
himself
everything
is
green
and
deep
green
at
that
arabs
usually
retire
early
so
once
i
have
finished
my
coffee
and
smoked
my
pipe
i
bid
goodnight
to
my
host
and
leave
him
to
his
wives
now
where
to
round
off
my
evening
well
it
too
early
for
bed
the
spahi
soldiers
have
sounded
the
retreat
on
their
bugles
yet
moreover
gold
cushions
were
dancing
fabulous
farandoles
round
me
and
making
sleep
impossible
i
outside
the
theatre
go
in
for
a
moment
the
milianah
theatre
is
an
old
fur
store
refurbished
as
far
as
possible
to
make
a
stage
and
auditorium
the
lighting
is
made
up
of
large
oil
lamps
which
are
refilled
during
the
interval
the
audience
stands
only
the
orchestra
sits
but
on
benches
the
galleries
are
quite
swish
with
cane
chairs
all
around
the
room
there
is
a
long
dark
corridor
with
no
wooden
flooring
you
might
as
well
be
in
the
street
it
has
absolutely
nothing
in
it
the
play
has
already
started
when
i
arrive
the
actors
are
at
all
bad
the
men
at
least
they
get
their
training
from
life
they
are
mainly
amateurs
soldiers
of
the
third
division
and
the
regiment
is
proud
of
them
and
supports
them
every
night
as
for
the
women
well
it
always
is
and
always
will
be
the
same
in
small
provincial
theatres
the
women
are
always
pretentious
artificial
and
overact
outrageously
and
yet
among
the
women
there
are
two
very
young
jewesses
beginners
at
the
drama
who
catch
my
eye
their
parents
are
in
the
audience
and
seem
enchanted
they
are
convinced
that
their
daughters
are
going
to
earn
a
fortune
on
the
stage
the
legendary
rachel
israeli
millionaire
and
actress
has
an
reputation
with
the
jews
nothing
could
be
more
comical
and
pathetic
than
these
two
little
jewesses
on
the
boards
they
stand
timidly
in
a
corner
of
the
scene
powdered
and
as
stiff
as
a
board
in
low
cut
dresses
they
are
cold
and
they
are
embarrassed
occasionally
they
gabble
a
phrase
without
understanding
its
meaning
and
as
they
speak
gaze
vacantly
into
the
auditorium
i
leave
the
theatre
i
hear
shouting
in
the
surrounding
blackness
from
somewhere
in
the
square
some
maltese
settling
a
point
no
doubt
at
the
point
of
a
knife
return
slowly
along
the
ramparts
to
the
hotel
a
gorgeous
scent
of
oranges
and
thujas
wafts
up
from
the
plain
the
air
is
mild
and
the
sky
almost
clear
at
the
end
of
the
road
yonder
an
old
walled
phantom
reaches
upwards
the
debris
of
some
old
temple
this
wall
is
sacred
every
day
arab
women
come
to
hang
gifts
bits
of
haiks
and
foutas
long
tresses
of
red
hair
tied
with
silver
wire
and
bits
of
burnous
all
this
dances
about
in
the
warm
breeze
lit
by
a
narrow
ray
of
moonlight
the
locusts
just
one
more
souvenir
of
algeria
and
then
back
to
the
windmill
i
could
sleep
the
night
i
arrived
at
the
farm
of
the
sahel
maybe
it
was
the
new
country
the
stress
of
the
voyage
the
barking
jackals
on
top
of
the
irritating
oppressive
and
completely
asphyxiating
heat
it
felt
as
though
the
mosquito
nets
were
keeping
the
air
out
with
the
insects
as
i
opened
my
window
at
first
light
i
saw
a
heavy
summer
mist
fringed
with
black
and
pink
and
floating
in
the
air
like
smoke
over
a
battle
field
not
a
leaf
moved
in
the
lovely
gardens
stretched
out
before
me
where
the
vines
that
gave
such
sweet
wine
were
enjoying
full
sunshine
on
the
slopes
there
were
also
european
fruit
trees
sheltered
in
a
shady
spot
and
small
orange
and
mandarin
trees
in
long
closely
packed
lines
everything
had
the
same
gloomy
look
about
it
with
that
certain
limpness
of
leaf
waiting
for
the
storm
even
the
banana
trees
those
great
reeds
usually
on
the
move
as
some
light
breeze
tangles
their
fine
light
foliage
stood
straight
and
silent
in
their
symmetrical
plumage
i
stayed
there
for
a
while
looking
at
this
fabulous
plantation
where
seemingly
all
types
of
the
world
trees
could
be
found
each
one
giving
exotic
flowers
and
fruit
in
its
proper
season
between
the
wheat
fields
and
the
massive
a
stream
shone
and
refreshed
the
eye
at
least
on
an
airless
morning
as
i
approved
the
fineness
and
order
of
it
all
the
beautiful
farm
with
its
moorish
arcades
and
terraces
brilliantly
white
in
the
dawn
and
its
surrounding
stables
and
barns
i
recalled
that
it
was
twenty
years
since
these
brave
settlers
set
up
home
in
the
valley
of
the
sahel
at
first
they
found
only
a
workman
shack
and
ground
haphazardly
planted
with
dwarf
palms
and
mastic
trees
everything
was
yet
to
be
done
everything
to
be
built
at
any
time
there
could
be
an
attack
from
arabs
they
had
to
leave
the
plough
out
for
cover
in
case
of
a
then
there
was
the
sickness
the
ophthalmia
the
fevers
and
the
failed
harvest
the
groping
inexperience
and
the
fight
against
a
administration
always
putting
off
its
prevarications
what
a
world
of
work
and
fatigue
and
having
to
watch
their
backs
all
the
time
even
now
despite
the
end
of
the
bad
times
and
the
good
fortune
both
the
settler
and
his
wife
were
up
before
anyone
else
on
the
farm
at
an
ungodly
hour
they
could
be
heard
coming
and
going
overlooking
the
workers
coffee
in
the
huge
kitchens
on
the
ground
floor
shortly
afterwards
a
bell
was
rung
and
the
workmen
set
out
for
the
day
work
there
were
some
burgundy
kabyle
workers
in
rags
and
red
tarbooshes
mahonian
terrace
workers
maltese
and
people
from
lucca
men
from
many
places
and
therefore
more
difficult
to
manage
outside
the
door
the
farmer
curtly
gave
out
the
day
work
to
everyone
when
he
was
finished
this
fine
man
looked
up
and
scrutinised
the
sky
anxiously
then
he
noticed
me
at
the
window
awful
growing
weather
he
told
me
here
comes
the
sirocco
in
fact
as
the
sun
rose
waves
of
hot
suffocating
air
came
in
from
the
south
as
though
an
oven
door
had
briefly
opened
we
did
know
where
to
put
ourselves
or
what
to
do
the
whole
morning
was
like
this
we
took
coffee
sitting
on
mats
in
the
gallery
without
finding
the
will
power
to
move
or
speak
the
dogs
stretched
out
hoping
the
flagstones
would
keep
them
cool
looked
utterly
washed
out
lunch
picked
us
up
a
bit
it
was
a
generous
if
singular
meal
and
included
carp
trout
wild
boar
hedgehog
staouëli
butter
crescian
wines
guavas
and
bananas
all
in
all
an
improbability
of
delicacies
which
nevertheless
reflected
the
complex
variety
of
nature
which
surrounded
us
we
were
just
about
to
get
up
from
the
table
when
shouts
rang
out
from
behind
the
closed
french
window
shouts
that
guaranteed
that
we
would
soon
experience
the
heat
in
the
garden
locusts
locusts
my
host
paled
as
any
man
would
who
had
been
told
of
an
impending
catastrophe
and
we
shot
outside
for
ten
minutes
in
the
farmhouse
once
so
calm
there
was
the
sound
of
running
footsteps
and
indistinct
voices
lost
in
the
sudden
panic
from
the
shade
of
the
dormitories
the
servants
rushed
outside
banging
and
clanging
anything
that
came
to
hand
sticks
forks
flails
copper
cauldrons
basins
saucepans
the
shepherds
blew
their
horns
others
blew
their
conches
or
their
hunting
horns
a
fearfully
discordant
racket
soon
overlaid
by
the
shrill
voices
of
the
arab
women
ululating
as
they
rushed
out
from
nearby
caves
sometimes
setting
up
a
great
racket
and
a
resonant
vibration
in
the
air
is
enough
to
send
the
locusts
away
or
at
least
to
stop
them
coming
down
so
where
were
they
then
these
awful
creatures
in
a
sky
vibrant
with
heat
i
saw
nothing
except
a
solitary
cloud
forming
on
the
horizon
a
dense
but
making
a
din
like
a
storm
in
a
forest
it
was
the
locusts
they
flew
en
masse
suspended
on
their
long
thin
wings
and
despite
all
the
shouting
and
effort
they
just
kept
on
coming
casting
a
huge
threatening
shadow
over
the
plain
soon
they
were
overhead
the
edges
of
the
cloud
frayed
momentarily
and
then
broke
away
as
some
of
them
distinct
and
reddish
peeled
off
from
the
rest
like
the
first
few
drops
of
a
shower
then
the
whole
cloud
burst
and
a
hailstorm
of
insects
fell
thick
fast
and
loud
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
the
fields
were
completely
obliterated
by
locusts
and
they
were
enormous
each
one
as
big
as
a
finger
then
the
killing
began
to
a
hideous
squelching
sound
like
straw
being
crushed
the
heaving
soil
was
turned
over
using
harrows
mattocks
and
ploughs
but
the
more
you
killed
the
more
of
them
there
were
they
swarmed
in
waves
their
front
legs
all
tangled
up
their
back
legs
leaping
for
dear
life
sometimes
into
the
path
of
the
horses
harnessed
up
for
this
bizarre
work
the
farm
dogs
and
some
from
the
caves
were
released
onto
the
fields
and
fell
amongst
them
crunching
them
in
a
frenzy
then
two
companies
of
turks
following
their
buglers
came
to
the
aid
of
the
colonists
and
the
massacre
changed
complexion
completely
they
did
crush
the
locusts
they
burnt
them
with
a
wide
sprinkling
of
gunpowder
i
was
drained
by
all
this
killing
and
sickened
by
the
smell
so
i
went
back
into
the
farmhouse
but
there
were
almost
as
many
in
there
they
had
come
in
through
the
open
doors
and
windows
and
down
the
chimney
on
the
woodwork
and
curtains
already
stripped
they
crawled
fell
fluttered
and
climbed
up
the
white
wall
casting
huge
shadows
making
them
look
even
uglier
and
there
was
just
no
getting
away
from
the
awful
stench
later
we
had
to
do
without
water
with
our
meal
as
the
tanks
basins
wells
and
fish
ponds
were
all
covered
over
with
dead
locusts
in
the
evening
in
my
room
where
many
had
been
killed
i
heard
a
buzzing
under
the
furniture
and
the
cracking
of
wing
cases
which
sounded
like
plant
pods
bursting
in
the
sweltering
heat
naturally
i
could
sleep
again
besides
everybody
else
was
still
noisily
busy
all
over
the
farm
flames
were
spreading
over
the
ground
from
one
end
of
the
plain
to
the
other
the
turks
were
still
in
their
killing
fields
the
next
day
opening
my
window
i
could
see
that
the
locusts
were
gone
but
what
total
devastation
they
left
behind
there
was
a
single
flower
or
a
blade
of
grass
everything
was
black
charred
and
eaten
away
only
the
banana
apricot
peach
and
mandarin
trees
could
be
recognised
by
the
outline
of
their
stripped
branches
but
lacking
the
charm
and
flourish
of
the
leaves
which
only
yesterday
had
been
their
living
essence
the
rooms
and
the
water
tanks
were
being
washed
out
everywhere
labourers
were
digging
into
the
ground
destroying
the
locusts
eggs
each
sod
of
soil
was
carefully
examined
and
turned
over
but
it
broke
their
hearts
to
see
the
thousands
of
white
roots
in
the
crumbling
soil
father

elixir
drink
this
friend
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it
at
this
the
priest
of
graveson
with
all
the
care
of
a
jeweller
counting
pearls
poured
me
two
fingers
of
what
proved
to
be
a
fresh
golden
cordial
sparklingly
exquisite
liqueur
it
warmed
the
cockles
of
my
heart
it
father
gaucher
elixir
the
pleasure
and
toast
of

crowed
the
kind
man
it
made
at
the
white
canons
monastery
a
few
kilometres
from
your
windmill
now
is
that
worth
all
the
chartreuses
in
the
world
and
if
you
like
to
know
the
amusing
story
of
this
delightful
elixir
listen
to
this
the
presbytery
dining
room
was
genuine
and
calm
with
little
pictures
of
the
stations
of
the
cross
and
attractive
clear
curtains
starched
like
a
surplice
it
was
in
there
that
the
priest
began
this
short
and
lightly
sceptical
and
irreverent
story
in
the
manner
of
erasmus
but
completely
without
art
or
malicious
intent
twenty
years
ago
the
norbertian
monks
called
the
white
canons
in
provence
hit
some
really
hard
times
to
see
their
living
conditions
at
that
time
was
to
feel
their
pain
their
great
wall
and
pacôme
tower
were
crumbling
away
the
cloister
was
disappearing
under
the
weeds
the
columns
were
splitting
and
the
stone
saints
were
collapsing
in
their
niches
there
was
no
stained
glass
window
unbroken
nor
door
still
on
its
hinges
within
the
chapels
and
the
inner
cloister
the
rhone
wind
entered
just
like
in
the
camargue
blowing
out
candles
bending
the
lead
and
breaking
the
glass
and
skimming
the
holy
water
from
its
font
tellingly
sadly
the
convent
bell
hung
as
silent
as
an
empty
dovecote
forcing
the
penniless
fathers
to
call
to
matins
with
an
almond
wood
clapper
oh
the
woeful
white
canons
i
can
still
see
them
in
procession
on
corpus
christi
day
sadly
filing
past
in
their
patched
capes
pale
emaciated
as
befitted
their
mainly
watermelon
diet
followed
by
his
grace
the
abbot
head
lowered
shamed
by
his
tarnished
crosier
and
his
eaten
away
white
wool
mitre
the
lady
followers
of
the
brotherhood
were
reduced
to
tears
of
pity
in
the
procession
and
the
were
tittering
quietly
amongst
themselves
as
the
poor
monks
appeared
those
who
dream
together
starve
together
the
fact
is
that
the
unfortunate
white
canons
had
come
to
the
point
where
they
were
wondering
if
they
would
be
better
off
finding
a
place
in
the
real
world
with
every
man
for
himself
one
day
when
this
grave
matter
was
under
discussion
in
the
chapter
the
prior
was
informed
that
brother
gaucher
wanted
to
be
heard
in
the
assembly
brother
gaucher
was
the
monastery
cowherd
which
meant
that
he
spent
his
entire
day
wandering
around
the
cloister
driving
two
old
emaciated
cows
from
one
archway
to
another
to
graze
the
grass
in
the
gaps
in
the
paving
he
had
been
looked
after
for
twelve
years
by
an
old
woman
from
the
baux
country
known
as
aunty
bégon
before
he
was
taken
in
by
the
monks
the
unfortunate
cowherd
had
been
unable
to
learn
anything
but
how
to
look
after
his
cattle
and
to
recite
his
our
father
and
then
only
in
the
provencal
language
as
he
was
too
dull
witted
for
anything
else
and
about
as
sharp
as
a
otherwise
he
was
a
fervent
christian
although
a
touch
extreme
at
ease
in
a
hair
shirt
and
doing
with
commendable
vigour
and
oh
brother
his
strong
arms
as
he
entered
the
chapter
room
simple
and
uncouth
and
greeted
the
assembly
with
a
sort
of
curtsey
the
prior
canons
treasurer
in
fact
everybody
began
to
laugh
his
greying
hair
goatee
beard
and
slightly
wild
eyes
always
had
this
effect
it
did
bother
brother
gaucher
though
reverend
fathers
he
said
meekly
as
he
twiddled
with
his
rosary
of
olive
pips
although
it
very
true
that
empty
vessels
make
the
most
noise
i
want
you
to
know
that
by
further
furrowing
my
already
poor
furrowed
brow
i
think
i
have
found
a
way
to
deliver
us
from
our
hardship
this
is
what
i
propose
you
all
know
about
aunty
bégon
the
kind
woman
who
looked
after
me
when
i
was
little
may
her
soul
rest
in
peace
the
old
vixen
she
used
to
sing
filthy
songs
after
drinking
i
must
tell
you
reverend
fathers
that
when
she
was
alive
she
was
as
familiar
with
the
herbs
of
the
mountainside
as
the
old
corsican
blackbird
now
before
she
died
she
developed
a
unique
elixir
made
from
several
different
kinds
of
herbs
that
we
had
gathered
in
the
alpilles
all
this
was
a
long
time
ago
but
with
the
help
of
augustine
and
your
permission
father
abbot
i
should
if
i
search
thoroughly
be
able
to
find
the
ingredients
for
this
elixir
we
will
then
only
have
to
bottle
it
and
sell
it
at
a
good
profit
this
would
allow
the
community
to
quietly
fill
its
coffers
like
our
brother
trappists
and
and
their
liqueur
grand
chartreu
before
he
could
finish
the
prior
had
stood
up
and
leapt
round
his
neck
the
canons
shook
him
by
the
hand
but
it
was
the
treasurer
who
was
more
moved
than
all
the
others
and
respectfully
kissed
the
edge
of
brother
gaucher
frayed
hood
each
one
then
went
back
to
his
seat
and
the
chapter
still
in
session
elected
to
entrust
the
cows
to
brother
thrasybule
so
that
brother
gaucher
could
dedicate
himself
to
making
his
elixir
how
what
trials
and
tribulations
the
good
brother
underwent
to
retrieve
aunty
bégon
recipe
history
does
tell
us
but
what
you
can
be
assured
of
is
that
after
only
six
months
the
white
canons
elixir
was
very
popular
throughout
the
districts
of
avignon
and
arles
there
was
a
single
farm
which
did
have
a
store
room
containing
a
small
brown
earthenware
bottle
showing
the
arms
of
provence
and
a
silver
label
depicting
a
monk
in
ecstasy
standing
amongst
the
bottles
of
sweet
wine
and
jars
of
picholine
olives
the
elixir
sold
in
a
big
way
and
the
house
of
the
white
canons
soon
became
wealthy
tower
was
rebuilt
the
prior
gloried
in
a
new
mitre
the
church
was
fitted
with
finely
worked
stained
glass
and
in
the
fine
filigree
stone
work
of
the
bell
tower
a
whole
range
of
bells
large
and
small
rang
out
their
first
fulsome
peal
on
one
fine
easter
morning
brother
gaucher
the
poor
lay
brother
whose
rustic
charms
who
had
so
enlivened
the
chapter
is
no
longer
to
be
found
there
from
now
on
he
is
known
only
as
the
reverend
father
gaucher
a
capable
man
of
great
learning
he
lives
apart
from
the
many
petty
concerns
of
the
cloister
locked
all
day
in
his
distillery
while
thirty
monks
scour
the
mountainside
collecting
pungent
herbs
for
him
the
distillery
was
in
an
old
unused
chapel
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
canons
garden
and
no
one
not
even
the
prior
himself
had
a
right
of
access
the
innocence
of
the
good
fathers
had
transformed
it
into
a
place
of
mystery
and
wonder
if
on
occasion
a
bold
and
curious
young
monk
made
use
of
the
climbing
vines
to
reach
the
rose
window
of
the
door
he
would
scramble
down
soon
enough
alarmed
by
the
sight
of
father
gaucher
who
looked
like
a
bearded
magician
leaning
over
his
flames
holding
his
all
around
there
were
pink
stoneware
retorts
huge
stills
coiled
glass
condensers
and
all
sorts
of
bizarre
equipment
which
gleamed
eerily
in
the
red
light
from
the
stained
glass
windows
at
nightfall
as
the
last
angelus
bell
was
ringing
the
door
of
this
mysterious
place
silently
opened
and
the
reverend
father
gaucher
emerged
to
attend
the
evening
church
service
it
warmed
the
heart
to
see
him
greeted
with
such
joy
as
he
crossed
the
monastery
grounds
the
brothers
rushed
to
be
at
his
side
they
said
hush
that
the
father
with
his
secret
the
treasurer
used
to
join
him
and
spoke
to
him
humbly
with
these
adulations
ringing
in
his
ears
the
father
walked
on
mopping
his
brow
and
placed
his
wide
brimmed
tricorne
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
where
it
gave
all
the
appearance
of
a
halo
and
looked
complacently
around
at
the
great
courtyard
planted
with
orange
trees
and
the
new
working
weathercocks
on
the
blue
roofs
in
the
sparklingly
white
cloister
between
the
elegant
columns
decorated
with
flowers
the
canons
in
new
clothes
were
filing
past
in
pairs
in
renewed
health
and
it
thanks
to
me
they
can
enjoy
all
that
the
reverend
thought
and
each
time
he
did
he
flushed
with
pride
but
the
unfortunate
man
was
to
be
well
punished
for
his
pride
as
you
will
see
who
would
have
thought
that
one
evening
during
the
service
he
would
come
to
church
in
an
extraordinarily
agitated
state
out
of
breath
his
cowl
askew
and
so
beside
himself
that
as
he
took
the
holy
water
he
wet
his
sleeves
up
to
the
elbow
at
first
it
was
thought
it
was
the
embarrassment
of
coming
late
but
he
was
then
seen
bowing
deeply
to
the
organ
and
the
gallery
instead
of
genuflecting
to
the
high
altar
and
then
breezing
quickly
across
the
church
and
wandering
about
for
five
minutes
looking
for
his
stall
after
all
this
once
seated
he
turned
to
right
and
left
smiling
beatifically
prompting
a
murmur
of
astonishment
that
spread
down
the
three
naves
from
prayer
book
to
prayer
book
the
whisper
went
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
father
gaucher
what
wrong
with
father
gaucher
twice
the
prior
struck
his
crosier
impatiently
on
the
flagstones
to
command
silence
over
at
the
back
of
the
choir
the
psalms
were
still
echoing
out
but
without
any
responses
suddenly
right
in
the
middle
of
the
father
gaucher
slumped
back
into
his
stall
and
began
singing
in
a
piercing
voice
in
paris
there
was
a
white
canon
who
went
all
the
way
with
a
black
nun
this
caused
everyone
great
dismay
and
they
all
stood
up
somebody
said
take
him
out
he
possessed
the
canons
crossed
themselves
his
grace
crosier
was
clattering
madly
away
but
father
gaucher
was
oblivious
to
all
this
and
two
monks
were
obliged
to
carry
him
out
through
the
little
choir
door
struggling
as
if
he
were
being
exorcised
and
continuing
with
his
hmm
tune
very
early
the
next
day
the
unhappy
father
was
in
the
prior
oratory
on
his
knees
in
floods
of
tears
showing
his
contrition
it
the
elixir
your
grace
which
caught
me
out
he
said
striking
his
chest
the
good
prior
himself
was
very
moved
to
see
him
so
grieved
and
penitent
come
come
father
gaucher
calm
down
all
this
will
disappear
like
dew
in
the
sunshine
after
all
worse
things
happen
at
sea
lots
of
people
begin
to
sing
when
they
are
a
little
hmm
hmm
we
must
hope
that
novices
would
have
understood
it
for
the
moment
let
see
tell
me
just
how
this
thing
came
to
pass
you
were
trying
out
the
liqueur
were
you
you
were
perhaps
a
little
generous
with
your
measure
yes
yes
i
understand
it
just
like
brother
schwartz
the
inventor
of
gunpowder
you
succumbed
to
your
own
invention
tell
me
my
dear
friend
is
it
really
necessary
to
test
this
terrific
liqueur
on
yourself
alas
yes
your
grace
the
tells
me
the
degree
of
the
alcohol
but
for
the
smoothness
of
the
finished
product
i
can
trust
nothing
but
my
own
palate
oh
yes
that
right
but
if
i
might
press
you
a
little
further
when
you
taste
the
elixir
in
that
way
does
it
seem
good
to
you
is
it
enjoyable
yes
i
afraid
it
does
your
grace
admitted
the
miserable
father
flushing
for
two
nights
now
i
found
it
had
such
a
bouquet
such
an
aroma
the
devil
himself
has
played
this
dirty
trick
on
me
from
now
on
i
am
determined
only
to
try
it
by
means
of
the
never
mind
if
the
liqueur
is
not
good
enough
and
if
it
is
quite
a
diamond
of
a
drink
hold
it
right
there
interrupted
the
prior
sharply
we
must
not
risk
upsetting
the
customers
all
you
need
to
do
for
the
moment
as
a
precaution
is
to
keep
a
eye
on
yourself
let
see
how
much
does
it
take
to
fully
establish
the
quality
lets
say
twenty
drops
it
would
need
a
hell
of
a
devil
to
catch
you
out
with
just
twenty
drops
moreover
to
avoid
any
possibility
of
accident
i
am
giving
you
a
dispensation
not
to
have
to
come
to
church
you
can
have
a
private
evening
service
in
the
distillery
and
now
you
may
go
in
peace
reverend
but
be
sure
to
count
the
drops
unfortunately
it
was
no
use
counting
the
drops
the
demon
held
of
him
anyway
and
having
held
him
would
let
go
so
now
it
was
the
distillery
that
heard
the
service
in
the
daytime
all
went
well
for
a
while
the
father
was
quite
relaxed
he
prepared
the
stoves
the
stills
and
carefully
selected
the
herbs
fine
grey
dentate
the
very
scented
essence
of
provencal
sunshine
but
in
the
evening
while
the
basic
ingredients
were
infusing
and
the
elixir
was
cooling
down
in
the
large
red
coppers
the
poor
man
torture
began
seventeen
eighteen
nineteen
twenty
the
drops
fell
tantalisingly
from
the
pipette
into
the
goblet
these
twenty
the
father
swallowed
in
one
go
almost
without
tasting
them
oh
how
he
would
have
loved
to
drink
the
health
of
that
twenty
first
drop
to
escape
temptation
he
had
to
lose
himself
in
prayer
kneeling
at
the
far
end
of
the
laboratory
unfortunately
the
still
warm
liqueur
was
still
releasing
a
hint
of
aromatic
fumes
which
swirled
around
him
and
led
him
on
regardless
towards
the
vats
the
liqueur
was
of
such
a
lovely
golden
green
colour
poised
above
it
his
nostrils
aquiver
he
stirred
it
very
gently
with
his
pipette
and
in
the
twinkling
eddies
which
were
spreading
throughout
the
emerald
ambrosia
he
thought
he
saw
the
sparkling
laughing
eyes
of
aunty
bégon
looking
back
at
him
oh
alright
just
one
more
drop
one
drop
yes
and
then
another
and
another
and
another
and
another
until
his
goblet
almost
overflowed
by
now
his
struggle
was
over
and
he
collapsed
into
a
large
armchair
his
body
cast
off
his
eyelids
half
closed
in
pleasure
and
in
pain
as
he
continued
to
sip
his
sinful
cup
and
said
with
sweet
remorse
oh
i
damned
if
i
do
i
damned
if
i
do
but
the
worst
was
still
to
come
as
he
reached
the
end
of
the
diabolical
liqueur
he
recalled
by
who
knows
what
spell
some
of
the
dirty
songs
of
aunty
bégon
paris
there
was
a
white
and
so
on
imagine
the
fuss
the
next
day
when
his
neighbouring
cell
mates
joked
to
him
knowingly
hey
hey
father
gaucher
you
were
well
off
your
head
last
night
when
you
went
to
bed
it
all
ended
in
tears
recriminations
fasting
the
hair
shirt
and
chastisement
of
course
but
nothing
nothing
could
defeat
the
demon
of
the
drink
and
every
evening
at
the
same
time
the
same
story
meanwhile
the
orders
were
flooding
into
the
abbey
and
it
was
a
blessing
they
came
from
nîmes
aix
avignon
marseilles
day
by
day
the
monastery
was
gradually
turning
into
a
factory
there
were
brother
packers
brother
labellers
brother
accountants
and
even
brother
wagoners
the
service
to
the
lord
though
was
getting
well
and
truly
lost
despite
the
odd
peal
of
bells
but
i
can
reveal
to
you
that
the
poor
folk
of
the
area
were
losing
out
by
it
and
then
one
fine
sunday
morning
as
the
treasurer
was
reading
out
his
end
of
year
report
before
the
whole
chapter
and
the
good
brothers
wide
eyed
and
smiling
were
listening
father
gaucher
rushed
into
the
meeting
shouting
it
all
over
i
am
doing
no
more
i
want
my
cows
back
so
what
wrong
father
gaucher
asked
the
prior
who
could
well
imagine
something
of
what
was
wrong
what
is
wrong
your
grace
what
is
wrong
is
that
i
am
making
an
eternity
of
hell
fire
and
forks
for
myself
it
is
wrong
that
i
am
drinking
and
i
am
drinking
like
a
sot
but
i
told
you
to
count
the
drops
oh
yes
of
course
count
the
drops
actually
i
count
by
tumblers
these
days
yes
reverends
that
how
bad
things
are
three
flagons
every
evening
you
must
understand
that
this
ca
continue
have
the
elixir
made
by
whomever
you
choose
but
may
i
burn
in
fire
if
i
have
anything
more
to
do
with
it
this
sobered
up
the
chapter
at
least
but
wretched
man
you
will
ruin
us
the
treasurer
shouted
brandishing
his
account
book
would
you
rather
that
i
am
damned
with
that
the
prior
stood
up
reverends
he
said
stretching
out
his
elegant
white
hand
with
its
shining
pastoral
ring
there
is
a
way
to
settle
this
it
in
the
evening
is
it
my
dear
son
when
the
demon
tempts
you
yes
prior
regularly
every
evening
as
well
as
that
as
the
night
approaches
i
get
begging
your
pardon
the
sweats
which
grip
me
just
like
capitou
ass
when
he
sees
them
coming
to
saddle
him
well
then
let
me
reassure
you
henceforth
every
evening
during
the
service
we
will
say
for
your
benefit
the
prayer
of
augustine
to
which
a
plenary
indulgence
is
attached
after
that
you
are
covered
no
matter
what
happens
it
brings
absolution
during
the
actual
commission
of
the
sin
oh
that
really
excellent
thank
you
so
much
prior
and
without
asking
for
more
father
gaucher
went
happily
back
to
his
stills
walking
on
air
actually
from
that
moment
every
evening
at
the
end
of
the
last
service
of
the
day
the
celebrant
never
forgot
to
add
let
us
pray
for
our
unfortunate
father
gaucher
who
is
sacrificing
his
soul
for
the
benefit
of
the
community
pray
for
us
lord
and
while
on
all
the
white
hoods
of
the
brothers
prostrated
in
the
shade
of
the
naves
the
prayer
fluttered
like
a
slight
breeze
on
snow
elsewhere
at
the
back
of
the
monastery
behind
the
flickering
reddened
glass
of
the
distillery
father
gaucher
could
be
heard
singing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
in
paris
there
was
a
white
canon
who
went
all
the
way
with
a
black
nun
here
the
good
priest
paused
horrified
mercy
me
if
my
parishioners
could
only
hear
me
in
the
camargue
i
departure
there
is
a
huge
buzzing
at
the
chateau
the
messenger
has
just
brought
word
from
the
keeper
half
in
french
and
half
in
provencal
announcing
that
there
had
already
been
two
or
three
fine
flights
of
herons
and
and
that
the
season
first
birds
were
in
short
supply
you
coming
hunting
with
us
my
friendly
neighbours
wrote
to
me
and
this
morning
at
the
unearthly
hour
of
five
their
large
wagon
loaded
with
rifles
dogs
and
provisions
came
to
pick
me
up
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
off
we
go
on
the
road
to
arles
which
is
a
bit
dry
and
the
trees
have
mostly
lost
their
leaves
by
this
time
in
december
the
pale
green
shoots
of
the
olive
trees
are
hardly
visible
and
the
garish
green
of
the
oaks
is
a
bit
too
wintry
and
artificial
the
stables
are
beginning
to
stir
into
life
while
very
early
risers
light
up
the
windows
in
the
farms
before
day
break
in
the
gaps
in
the
stones
amongst
the
ruins
of
abbey
the
sea
eagles
still
drowsy
stretch
their
wings
despite
the
hour
the
old
peasant
women
are
coming
from
the
trotting
along
in
their
donkey
carts
we
pass
them
alongside
the
ditches
they
have
to
go
six
country
kilometres
to
sit
on
the
steps
of
trophyme
to
sell
their
small
packets
of
medicinal
herbs
collected
on
the
mountain
the
low
crenellated
ramparts
of
arles
appear
just
as
you
see
them
on
old
engravings
which
show
warriors
with
lances
larger
than
the
talus
they
are
standing
on
we
gallop
through
this
marvellous
small
town
surely
one
of
the
most
picturesque
in
france
with
its
rounded
sculptured
balconies
jutting
out
into
the
middle
of
the
narrow
streets
there
are
old
black
houses
with
tiny
doors
in
the
moorish
style
gothic
and
which
take
you
back
to
the
time
of
william
the
and
the
saracens
at
this
hour
there
nobody
about
yet
except
the
quay
on
the
river
rhone
the
camargue
boat
is
steaming
up
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
and
is
ready
to
sail
the
tenant
farmers
are
there
in
their
red
serge
jackets
so
are
some
young
women
of
la
roquette
out
looking
for
farm
work
and
standing
on
the
deck
amongst
us
chatting
and
laughing
with
their
long
brown
mantles
turned
down
because
of
the
sharp
morning
air
the
tall
arles
headdresses
makes
their
heads
look
small
and
elegant
with
an
attractive
pertness
and
they
feel
the
need
to
stand
on
tip
toe
so
that
their
laughter
and
banter
can
be
heard
by
everybody
the
bell
rings
and
off
we
go
what
with
the
fast
flow
of
the
rhone
the
propeller
and
the
mistral
the
two
river
banks
speed
by
on
one
side
there
is
the
crau
an
arid
stony
plain
on
the
other
we
have
the
camargue
much
greener
with
its
short
grass
and
swamps
full
of
reeds
stretching
all
the
way
to
the
sea
from
time
to
time
the
boat
pulls
in
at
a
landing
stage
on
the
right
or
left
bank
or
on
the
or
the
as
it
was
known
in
the
middle
ages
in
the
time
when
arles
was
a
kingdom
the
old
rhone
sailors
still
use
these
same
words
today
at
every
stop
there
was
a
white
farm
and
a
clump
of
trees
the
workmen
getting
off
with
their
tools
and
the
women
with
their
baskets
under
their
arms
go
straight
onto
the
gangway
little
by
little
the
boat
empties
first
on
the
empire
side
and
then
on
the
kingdom
and
by
the
time
we
get
off
at
there
hardly
anybody
left
on
board
the
is
an
old
farm
of
the
lords
of
barbentane
and
we
went
in
to
await
the
keeper
appointed
to
come
and
meet
us
in
the
main
kitchen
all
the
farm
hands
ploughmen
winegrowers
and
shepherds
are
sitting
at
the
table
solemnly
silently
and
slowly
eating
their
meal
and
being
served
by
the
women
who
have
to
wait
to
eat
until
the
men
are
finished
presently
the
keeper
arrives
with
the
cart
he
is
a
real
type
a
trapper
on
land
and
water
and
gamekeeper
known
locally
as
the
stalker
because
he
can
always
be
found
in
the
morning
mists
or
at
nightfall
stalking
amongst
the
reeds
or
stock
still
in
his
small
boat
watching
over
his
keep
nets
on
the
open
water
and
the
irrigation
channels
it
may
be
this
work
of
perpetual
lookout
that
makes
him
so
silent
and
focussed
and
yet
as
the
cart
full
of
rifles
and
baskets
trundles
along
in
front
of
us
he
gives
us
news
of
the
hunt
the
number
of
and
the
location
where
the
birds
of
passage
have
been
brought
down
as
he
talks
he
melts
into
the
landscape
the
cultivated
earth
gives
way
to
the
true
untamed
camargue
amongst
the
pasture
and
the
marshland
and
the
irrigation
channels
shine
in
amongst
the
plants
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
bunches
of
tamarisks
and
reeds
form
little
islands
on
a
calm
sea
there
are
no
tall
trees
the
immense
evenness
of
the
plain
is
unbroken
the
animal
sheds
have
roofs
that
slope
down
almost
to
ground
level
the
roaming
flocks
lying
in
the
salt
grass
or
making
their
way
as
they
nuzzle
around
the
shepherd
red
cape
do
disturb
the
landscape
regular
flow
dwarfed
as
they
are
by
the
endless
space
of
blue
horizons
and
open
sky
just
as
a
rough
sea
is
still
the
sea
so
a
sense
of
solitude
and
immensity
emerges
heightened
by
the
relentless
mistral
which
with
its
powerful
breath
seems
to
flatten
yet
enlarge
the
landscape
everything
bows
down
before
it
the
smallest
shrubs
bear
the
imprint
of
its
passage
and
stay
twisted
and
bent
over
southwards
in
an
attitude
of
perpetual
flight
ii
the
shack
the
roof
and
walls
consist
of
dried
yellowing
reeds
this
is
the
shack
which
is
to
be
our
meeting
place
for
the
hunt
a
not
untypical
house
of
the
camargue
it
has
a
single
vast
high
room
with
no
window
getting
its
daylight
through
a
glass
door
kept
fully
shuttered
at
night
all
along
the
huge
rendered
whitewashed
walls
the
waits
for
the
rifles
the
game
bags
and
the
wading
boots
at
the
back
five
or
six
bunks
are
placed
round
an
actual
boat
mast
which
is
stepped
into
the
soil
and
reaches
the
roof
which
it
supports
during
the
night
while
the
mistral
is
blowing
and
the
house
is
creaking
everywhere
the
distant
sea
seems
nearer
than
it
is
its
sound
carried
by
the
freshening
wind
and
gives
us
the
impression
of
being
in
a
boat
cabin
in
the
afternoon
the
shack
is
especially
charming
throughout
our
beautiful
southern
winter
days
i
enjoy
being
alone
by
the
tall
mantelpiece
while
several
twigs
of
tamarisk
smoke
away
in
the
hearth
the
howling
mistral
or
tramontana
makes
the
doors
bang
the
reeds
scream
and
a
range
of
noises
that
make
the
great
natural
clamour
all
around
the
rays
of
the
winter
sun
gather
and
are
then
scattered
by
the
fierce
wind
great
shadows
race
around
under
a
perfect
blue
sky
the
light
comes
in
flashes
and
the
noise
in
crashes
and
the
flock
bells
are
suddenly
heard
then
lost
in
the
wind
only
to
emerge
again
under
the
rattling
door
like
a
charming
refrain
twilight
just
before
the
hunters
come
back
is
the
most
exquisite
time
of
day
by
then
the
wind
has
moderated
i
go
out
for
a
moment
the
great
red
sun
at
peace
at
last
goes
down
in
flames
but
without
heat
night
falls
and
brushes
you
with
its
damp
black
wing
as
it
passes
over
somewhere
at
ground
level
there
is
a
bang
a
flash
as
the
red
star
of
a
rifle
shot
bursts
into
the
surrounding
blackness
what
is
left
of
the
day
rushes
past
a
long
flight
of
ducks
flies
by
low
as
if
looking
for
somewhere
to
land
but
suddenly
catching
sight
of
the
cabin
where
the
fire
is
lit
they
take
fright
the
one
at
the
head
rises
and
the
rest
follow
as
they
fly
away
screaming
soon
afterwards
a
great
shuffling
sound
something
like
rain
falling
approaches
thousands
of
sheep
brought
back
by
the
shepherds
and
urged
on
by
the
dogs
are
anxiously
and
haphazardly
and
breathlessly
scurrying
about
towards
the
folds
i
am
overrun
by
them
and
they
barge
into
me
as
i
am
caught
up
in
a
maelstrom
of
woollen
curls
and
bleating
it
was
an
ocean
swell
of
sheep
that
seems
to
carry
away
the
shepherds
on
leaping
waves
of
wool
behind
the
flock
friendly
footsteps
and
joyful
voices
are
heard
the
shack
fills
up
and
becomes
lively
and
boisterous
the
kindling
blazes
on
the
fire
the
more
tired
they
are
the
more
they
laugh
it
is
a
dizzy
happy
fatigue
their
rifles
stacked
in
a
corner
long
boots
strewn
about
and
game
bags
emptied
into
a
bloodied
heap
of
red
golden
green
and
silver
plumage
in
the
smoke
the
table
is
set
out
with
a
good
eel
soup
silence
falls
the
huge
silence
of
robust
appetites
only
broken
by
the
ferocious
growling
of
the
dogs
as
they
scuffle
to
sample
their
bowls
by
the
door
the
evening
will
soon
end
by
now
there
is
only
the
keeper
and
i
in
front
of
the
flickering
fire
we
chat
desultorily
occasionally
throwing
at
each
other
with
red
indian
style
grunts
which
fizzle
out
like
the
last
sparks
of
the
dying
fire
eventually
the
keeper
stands
up
lights
his
lantern
and
i
hear
his
heavy
footsteps
fade
into
the
night
iii
the
what
an
appropriate
name
for
the
lookout
the
expectancy
of
the
hunter
lying
in
wait
and
the
uncertainty
of
hours
of
total
concentration
waiting
and
wishing
between
day
and
night
the
morning
lookout
is
just
before
sunrise
there
is
a
lookout
posted
from
evening
until
twilight
which
is
the
one
i
prefer
especially
in
this
marshland
where
the
swamp
water
sustains
the
daylight
for
so
long
sometimes
the
lookout
takes
place
in
a
tiny
punt
a
narrow
keelless
boat
which
rolls
at
the
drop
of
a
hat
hidden
to
peak
of
his
cap
by
the
reeds
the
hunter
lying
on
the
bottom
of
the
boat
keeps
an
eye
out
for
ducks
the
gun
barrel
and
the
dog
head
sniff
the
air
the
dog
catches
mosquitoes
or
else
stretches
out
its
huge
paws
and
pitches
the
whole
over
and
fills
it
with
water
all
this
looking
out
is
a
bit
too
complicated
for
my
tyro
taste
most
of
the
time
i
go
to
the
on
foot
paddling
deep
into
the
swamp
in
enormous
leather
waders
i
move
slowly
and
carefully
for
fear
of
getting
stuck
in
the
mud
i
try
to
avoid
stinking
reeds
and
jumping
frogs
happily
an
islet
of
tamarisks
finally
appears
and
i
can
get
myself
onto
some
dry
land
the
keeper
did
me
the
honour
of
leaving
his
dog
with
me
a
huge
great
pyrenees
with
a
long
white
shaggy
coat
a
prime
hunter
and
fishing
dog
whose
presence
never
ceases
to
intimidate
me
somewhat
when
a
water
fowl
comes
within
firing
range
the
dog
has
an
ironical
way
of
looking
at
me
and
throwing
his
head
back
like
a
disdainful
arty
type
and
with
his
two
long
ears
flopping
in
front
of
his
eyes
he
freezes
and
wags
his
tail
in
a
perfect
mime
of
impatience
as
if
to
say
shoot
go
on
then
shoot
i
obey
i
miss
so
he
lies
down
full
length
and
yawns
and
stretches
himself
out
giving
the
appearance
for
all
the
world
of
being
tired
discouraged
and
insolent
oh
very
well
then
you
right
i
am
a
bad
shot
what
really
fascinates
me
about
the
lookout
is
the
sunset
the
dimming
light
taking
refuge
in
the
water
of
the
shining
lakes
which
transform
the
grey
tint
of
the
overcast
sky
into
a
fine
shade
of
polished
silver
i
love
the
smell
of
the
water
and
the
mysterious
rustling
of
long
leaves
and
insects
in
the
reeds
every
so
often
a
darker
note
sounds
and
rolls
across
the
sky
like
the
sound
of
a
conch
shell
it
the
boom
of
the
bittern
as
it
plunges
its
huge
wader
beak
to
the
bed
of
the
swamp
noisy
crane
flights
startle
me
and
i
can
hear
the
movement
of
their
feathered
plumed
wings
then
nothing
it
the
night
the
deep
dark
night
with
just
a
glimmer
of
daylight
left
lingering
on
the
water
suddenly
i
feel
sort
of
nervous
unease
as
if
someone
was
behind
me
i
turn
round
and
am
reassured
by
the
sight
of
that
ubiquitous
travelling
companion
of
fine
nights
the
moon
a
low
large
and
full
moon
rising
calmly
and
with
a
visible
motion
which
slows
gradually
as
it
rises
above
the
horizon
a
moonlit
patch
is
already
clearly
visible
nearby
then
another
then
one
further
off
eventually
the
whole
marsh
is
bathed
in
moonlight
and
the
least
tuft
of
grass
gives
a
shadow
the
lookout
is
over
the
birds
can
see
us
we
have
to
return
to
base
we
walk
bathed
in
a
dusting
of
weak
blue
light
each
step
we
make
in
the
open
water
and
the
irrigation
channels
stirs
the
horde
of
reflected
stars
and
the
moonlight
that
penetrates
the
depths
of
the
water
iv
red
and
white
within
rifle
range
of
the
shack
there
is
another
one
similar
but
more
rustic
it
home
to
our
keeper
his
wife
and
their
two
eldest
children
the
girl
is
responsible
for
the
men
meal
and
doing
repairs
to
the
fishing
nets
while
the
boy
helps
his
father
look
into
the
keep
nets
and
maintain
the
sluice
gates
in
the
ponds
the
two
youngest
children
are
in
arles
staying
with
their
grandmother
until
they
have
learned
to
read
and
have
taken
their
first
communion
it
is
too
far
to
the
school
and
the
church
from
here
and
the
atmosphere
of
the
camargue
is
completely
unsuitable
for
young
children
the
fact
is
that
come
the
summer
when
the
marshes
are
dry
and
the
white
mud
of
the
irrigation
channels
cracks
in
the
great
heat
the
islet
is
really
habitable
at
all
i
experienced
it
once
when
i
came
in
august
to
hunt
ducklings
and
i
will
never
forget
the
miserable
and
ferocious
appearance
of
the
burningly
hot
landscape
here
and
there
ponds
were
steaming
in
the
sun
like
huge
fermentation
vats
keeping
scant
signs
of
life
perhaps
just
salamanders
spiders
and
water
insects
looking
for
some
moisture
there
was
a
pestilential
air
about
a
miasmic
brooding
fog
thickened
by
innumerable
clouds
of
mosquitoes
at
the
keeper
house
everybody
had
the
shivers
everybody
had
the
fever
and
it
was
pitiful
to
see
the
yellowed
drawn
faces
and
the
circled
popping
eyes
of
these
unfortunates
who
were
condemned
to
drag
themselves
around
for
three
months
under
this
high
pitiless
sun
which
burnt
but
did
warm
the
life
of
a
gamekeeper
is
miserable
and
hard
in
the
camargue
at
least
ours
has
his
wife
and
children
round
him
but
a
little
further
on
in
the
marsh
a
lives
absolutely
alone
from
one
end
to
the
next
robinson
crusoe
like
in
his
reed
cabin
there
is
a
single
household
utensil
not
made
by
him
the
woven
hammock
the
three
black
stones
that
form
the
hearth
the
tamarisk
roots
made
into
stools
even
the
lock
and
key
made
from
white
wood
that
secures
this
unique
accommodation
the
man
himself
is
at
least
as
strange
as
his
dwelling
he
is
a
sort
of
silent
thinker
like
so
many
solitary
people
hiding
his
wariness
under
thick
bushy
eyebrows
when
not
on
the
pasture
land
he
can
be
found
sitting
outside
his
door
and
with
touching
childlike
care
slowly
fathoming
out
one
of
the
little
coloured
leaflets
which
are
wrapped
around
phials
of
medicines
for
his
horses
the
poor
devil
has
any
recreation
but
reading
these
leaflets
despite
being
neighbours
our
keeper
and
he
do
see
each
other
they
actually
avoid
each
other
one
day
when
i
asked
the
stalker
the
reason
for
this
he
replied
in
a
serious
manner
it
because
of
a
difference
of
opinion
he
is
a
red
i
am
a
white
well
even
in
this
wilderness
where
solitude
ought
to
have
brought
them
close
together
these
two
unsociable
people
as
ignorant
and
naïve
as
each
other
these
two
cowherds
of
theocritus
who
barely
go
to
town
once
a
year
and
the
small
cafés
of
arles
must
seem
like
the
palace
of
ptolemy
to
them
have
managed
to
fall
out
about
politics
of
all
things
v
lake
vaccares
one
of
the
finest
sights
in
the
camargue
is
lake
vaccares
i
often
leave
the
hunt
to
sit
down
by
the
shore
of
this
beautiful
brackish
lake
this
baby
inland
sea
which
seems
a
true
daughter
of
the
ocean
being
locked
indoors
so
to
speak
she
is
made
all
the
more
appealing
through
her
captivity
there
is
none
of
the
dryness
and
aridity
that
often
bedevils
the
seaside
around
our
vaccares
on
its
high
banks
it
boasts
a
fulsome
covering
of
fine
grass
a
perfect
showcase
for
unique
and
charming
flora
there
are
centauries
clover
gentians
and
those
lovely
flowers
that
are
blue
in
winter
and
red
in
summer
apparently
changing
their
clothes
to
suit
the
weather
and
when
they
have
an
uninterrupted
flowering
season
show
their
full
range
of
colours
about
five
in
the
evening
as
the
sun
is
going
down
these
three
watery
delights
without
boat
and
sail
to
cover
and
change
them
open
out
into
an
amazing
scene
no
longer
is
it
just
the
intimate
charm
of
the
and
the
irrigation
channels
appearing
here
and
there
between
folds
of
marl
where
the
smell
of
water
pervades
and
is
likely
to
emerge
at
the
least
depression
in
the
ground
here
lake
vaccares
gives
an
impression
of
size
and
space
the
radiant
waves
attract
flights
of
scoter
ducks
from
far
away
and
herons
bitterns
and
flamingos
lining
up
to
fish
all
along
the
banks
in
strands
then
there
are
ibis
the
sacred
ibis
of
egypt
truly
at
home
in
this
splendid
sunshine
and
silent
landscape
from
where
i
am
i
can
hear
nothing
but
the
lapping
of
water
and
the
ranger
calling
his
horses
from
around
the
lakeside
each
animal
on
hearing
its
name
rushes
in
mane
flowing
in
the
wind
and
takes
hay
from
his
hand
further
on
still
on
the
same
bank
there
is
a
herd
of
beef
cattle
free
ranging
like
the
horses
sometimes
i
notice
their
bony
curved
backs
hunched
over
a
clump
of
tamarisk
and
their
small
immature
horns
just
visible
most
of
these
camargue
cattle
are
bred
to
run
in
the
branding
fêtes
in
the
villages
and
some
of
them
are
already
famed
in
the
circuses
of
provence
and
languedoc
in
one
herd
of
the
neighbourhood
there
was
a
terrible
fighter
amongst
them
called
the
roman
who
has
been
the
undoing
of
i
do
know
how
many
men
and
horses
at
the
bullfights
at
arles
nîmes
and
tarascon
his
companions
also
made
him
the
leader
for
in
these
strange
herds
the
animals
organise
themselves
around
an
old
bull
which
they
adopt
as
their
leader
when
there
is
a
storm
on
the
camargue
it
is
truly
terrifying
on
the
great
plain
where
there
is
nothing
to
divert
or
stop
it
it
an
amazing
sight
to
see
the
herd
group
themselves
behind
their
leader
all
their
heads
down
and
turned
into
the
wind
their
whole
strength
behind
their
foreheads
shepherds
in
provence
call
this
manoeuvre
the
horn
to
perish
the
herd
that
does
do
it
blinded
by
the
rain
and
carried
away
by
the
storm
the
herd
turns
in
on
itself
becomes
panicky
scatters
and
is
overwhelmed
to
escape
the
storm
they
have
been
known
to
dash
headlong
into
the
rhone
the
vaccares
or
even
the
sea
nostalgia
for
the
barracks
and
paris
this
morning
at
first
light
a
formidable
woke
me
with
a
start
a
from
amongst
my
pines
at
this
hour
what
a
ridiculous
thing
for
goodness
sake
as
quickly
as
i
can
i
jump
out
of
bed
and
run
to
the
door
nobody
about
the
noise
has
ceased
from
the
midst
of
some
wet
wild
vines
a
couple
of
curlews
fly
off
noisily
a
light
breeze
sings
in
the
trees
towards
the
east
on
the
sharp
ridge
of
the
alpilles
a
golden
dust
amasses
from
which
the
sun
slowly
appears
the
first
sunbeam
is
already
touching
the
roof
of
the
windmill
immediately
the
starts
again
hidden
this
time
from
in
the
fields
the
devil
i
had
forgotten
about
it
what
sort
of
idiot
then
greets
the
day
from
the
middle
of
the
woods
with
a
drum
i
try
my
best
to
get
a
look
but
i
ca
see
anyone
nothing
except
the
tufts
of
lavender
and
the
pine
trees
which
go
down
right
to
the
road
perhaps
there
is
some
goblin
hidden
in
the
thicket
mocking
me
it
must
be
ariel
or
puck
the
rascal
must
have
said
to
himself
as
he
passed
my
windmill
that
parisian
is
much
too
tranquil
in
there
let
have
a
dawn
serenade
for
him
whereupon
he
took
up
his
big
drum
and
more
will
you
shut
that
thing
up
puck
you
will
wake
up
the
cicadas
it
was
puck
it
was
gouget
francois
called
pistolet
drummer
in
the
battalion
and
right
now
on
his
biannual
leave
pistolet
is
bored
stiff
here
and
he
has
his
memories
and
he
has
his
drum
and
when
someone
from
the
village
wants
to
the
instrument
he
goes
out
and
bangs
the
damned
drum
in
the
woods
and
dreams
of
the
barracks
back
in
paris
today
he
is
honouring
a
small
green
hillock
with
his
reveries
there
he
is
propping
up
a
pine
tree
his
drum
in
his
arms
having
a
field
day
partridges
alarmed
take
to
the
air
from
under
his
feet
but
he
does
notice
them
wild
flowers
bathe
him
in
their
scent
but
he
does
smell
them
he
does
see
the
fine
spiders
webs
vibrating
in
the
sun
amongst
the
branches
nor
the
pine
needles
which
jump
about
on
his
drum
completely
given
over
to
his
reverie
and
his
music
he
looks
lovingly
at
the
blur
of
his
whizzing
drumsticks
and
his
large
dull
face
lights
up
with
pleasure
at
every
roll
how
lovely
the
great
barracks
is
with
its
large
flagged
courtyard
its
orderly
all
in
line
windows
its
men
in
military
caps
and
its
low
arcades
full
of
clattering
oh
the
echoing
steps
the
whitewashed
corridors
the
smelly
dormitory
the
belts
to
be
polished
the
slab
of
bread
the
tins
of
polish
the
iron
bedsteads
with
grey
covers
the
gleaming
rifles
in
the
rack
oh
the
good
days
with
the
corps
the
cards
that
stick
to
your
fingers
the
hideous
queen
of
spades
with
her
feathered
charms
the
old
newspaper
pages
missing
scattered
on
the
beds
oh
the
long
nights
on
guard
at
the
ministry
door
the
old
sentry
box
which
rains
in
the
frozen
feet
the
carriages
which
splash
you
going
past
oh
the
extra
fatigues
the
days
without
break
the
stinking
wash
tub
the
wooden
pillow
the
reveille
on
cold
wet
mornings
the
retreat
in
fog
and
at
lights
on
time
the
evening
that
finds
you
late
and
breathless
oh
the
bois
de
vincennes
the
thick
white
cotton
gloves
the
walks
on
the
fortifications
oh
the
military
school
entrance
the
loose
women
the
sound
of
the
cornet
at
the
salon
de
mars
the
absinth
in
the
bars
the
shared
secrets
between
hiccoughs
the
sabres
drawn
the
sentimental
tale
told
hand
on
heart
dream
on
poor
man
i
wo
be
the
one
to
stop
you
hit
your
drum
and
hit
it
hard
hit
it
as
hard
as
you
can
i
have
no
right
to
ridicule
you
so
you
are
nostalgic
for
your
barracks
am
i
not
just
as
nostalgic
for
mine
my
paris
haunts
me
just
like
yours
you
you
play
your
drum
among
the
pines
me
i
write
here
what
a
right
pair
of
provencal
people
we
are
back
in
paris
we
miss
our
alpilles
and
the
smell
of
wild
lavender
right
here
and
right
now
bang
in
the
middle
of
provence
we
miss
our
barracks
and
everything
that
reminds
us
of
it
is
so
dear
to
us
eight
strikes
in
the
village
pistolet
drumsticks
at
the
ready
starts
on
his
way
back
he
can
be
heard
playing
coming
down
from
the
woods
me
i
lie
down
in
the
grass
overwhelmed
with
nostalgia
as
the
drum
fades
into
the
distance
all
my
own
familiar
paris
passes
before
my
eyes
there
amongst
the
pines
ah
paris
paris
paris
for
ever
