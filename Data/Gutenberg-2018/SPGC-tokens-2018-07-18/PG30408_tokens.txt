and
the
thing
moved
by
way
of
professor

tube
tommy
and
evelyn
invade
the
inimical
world
of
golden
cities
and
jungles
and
ragged
men
the
tube
complete
by

leinster
chapter
i
the
generator
rumbled
and
roared
building
up
to
its
maximum
speed
the
whole
laboratory
quivered
from
its
vibration
the
dynamo
hummed
and
whined
and
the
night
silence
outside
seemed
to
make
the
noises
within
more
deafening
tommy
reames
ran
his
eyes
again
over
the
to
the
monstrous
misshapen
coils
professor
denham
bent
over
one
of
them
straightened
and
nodded
tommy
reames
nodded
to
evelyn
and
she
threw
the
heavy
switch
there
was
a
flash
of
jumping
current
the
masses
of
metal
on
the
floor
seemed
to
leap
into
ungainly
life
the
whine
of
the
dynamo
rose
to
a
scream
and
its
brushes
streaked
blue
flame
the
metal
things
on
the
floor
flicked
together
and
were
a
tube
three
feet
and
more
in
diameter
that
tube
writhed
and
twisted
it
began
to
form
itself
into
an
awkward
and
seemingly
impossible
shape
while
metal
surfaces
sliding
on
each
other
produced
screams
that
cut
through
the
din
of
the
motor
and
dynamo
the
writhing
tube
strained
and
wriggled
then
there
was
a
queer
inaudible
and
something
gave
a
part
of
the
tube
quivered
into
nothingness
another
part
hurt
the
eyes
that
looked
upon
it
and
then
there
was
the
smell
of
burned
insulation
and
a
wire
was
arcing
somewhere
while
thick
rubbery
smoke
arose
a
fuse
blew
out
with
a
thunderous
report
and
tommy
reames
leaped
to
the
suddenly
racing
the
motor
died
amid
gasps
and
rumblings
and
tommy
reames
looked
anxiously
at
the
tube
it
was
important
that
tube
through
it
tommy
reames
and
professor
denham
had
reason
to
believe
they
could
travel
to
another
universe
of
which
other
men
had
only
dreamed
and
it
was
important
in
other
ways
too
at
the
moment
evelyn
denham
threw
the
switch
newspapers
in
chicago
were
showing
headlines
about
king
forfeiture
of
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
bail
by
failing
to
appear
in
court
king
jacaro
was
a
lord
of
racketeerdom
while
tommy
inspected
the
tube
anxiously
a
certain
chief
of
police
in
a
small
town
upstate
was
telling
feverishly
over
the
telephone
of
a
posse
having
killed
a
monster
lizard
by
torchlight
having
discovered
it
in
the
act
of
devouring
a
cow
the
lizard
was
eight
feet
high
walked
on
its
hind
legs
and
had
a
collar
of
solid
gold
about
its
neck
and
jewel
importers
in
new
york
were
in
anxious
conference
about
a
flood
of
untraced
jewels
upon
the
market
their
origin
was
unknown
the
tube
ultimately
affected
all
of
those
affairs
and
the
death
mist
as
well
and
though
it
was
not
considered
dangerous
then
everybody
remembers
the
death
mist
now
but
at
the
moment
professor
denham
stared
at
the
tube
concernedly
his
daughter
evelyn
shivered
from
pure
excitement
as
she
looked
at
it
and
a
man
named
smithers
looked
impassively
from
the
tube
to
tommy
reames
and
back
again
he
done
most
of
the
mechanical
work
on
the
tube
parts
and
he
was
as
anxious
as
the
rest
but
nobody
thought
of
the
world
outside
the
laboratory
professor
denham
moved
suddenly
he
was
nearest
to
the
open
end
of
the
tube
he
sniffed
curiously
and
seemed
to
listen
within
seconds
the
others
became
aware
of
a
new
smell
in
the
laboratory
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
tube
itself
and
it
was
a
warm
damp
smell
that
could
only
be
imagined
as
coming
from
a
jungle
in
the
tropics
there
were
the
rich
odors
of
feverishly
growing
things
the
heavy
fragrance
of
unknown
tropic
blossoms
and
a
background
of
some
curious
blend
of
scents
and
smells
which
was
alien
and
luring
and
exotic
the
whole
was
like
the
smell
of
another
planet
of
the
jungles
of
a
strange
world
which
men
had
never
trod
and
then
definitely
coming
out
of
the
tube
there
was
a
hollow
booming
noise
it
had
been
echoed
and
amid
the
twistings
of
the
tube
but
only
an
animal
could
have
made
it
it
grew
louder
a
monstrous
roar
then
yells
sounded
suddenly
above
it
human
yells
wild
yells
insane
yells
of
hysterical
excitement
and
blood
lust
the
bellowed
and
an
ululating
chorus
of
joyous
screams
arose
the
laboratory
reverberated
with
the
thunderous
noise
then
there
was
the
sound
of
crashing
and
of
paddings
and
abruptly
the
noise
was
diminishing
as
if
its
source
were
moving
farther
away
the
roared
and
bellowed
as
if
in
agony
and
the
yelling
noise
seemed
to
show
that
men
were
following
close
upon
its
flanks
those
in
the
laboratory
seemed
to
awaken
as
if
from
a
bad
dream
denham
was
kneeling
before
the
mouth
of
the
tube
an
automatic
rifle
in
his
hands
tommy
reames
stood
grimly
before
evelyn
he
snatched
up
a
pair
of
automatic
pistols
smithers
clutched
a
spanner
and
watched
the
mouth
of
the
tube
with
a
strained
attention
evelyn
stood
shivering
behind
tommy
tommy
said
with
a
hint
of
grim
humor
i
do
think
there
any
doubt
about
the
tube
having
gotten
through
that
the
fifth
dimension
planet
all
right
he
smiled
at
evelyn
she
was
deathly
pale
i
remember
hearing
noises
like
that
denham
stood
up
he
painstakingly
slipped
on
the
safety
of
his
rifle
and
laid
it
on
a
bench
with
the
other
guns
there
was
a
small
arsenal
on
a
bench
at
one
side
of
the
laboratory
the
array
looked
much
more
like
arms
for
in
expedition
into
dangerous
territory
than
a
normal
part
of
apparatus
for
an
experiment
in
rather
abstruse
mathematical
physics
there
were
even
gas
masks
on
the
bench
and
some
of
those
converted
brass
very
pistols
now
used
only
for
discharging
and
bombs
the
tube
was
seen
anyhow
said
professor
denham
briskly
going
through
first
tommy
slung
a
cartridge
belt
about
his
waist
and
a
gas
mask
about
his
neck
i
am
he
said
shortly
we
want
to
camouflage
the
mouth
of
the
tube
i
watch
a
bit
before
i
get
out
he
crawled
into
the
mouth
of
the
twisted
pipe
the
tube
was
nearly
three
feet
across
each
section
was
five
feet
long
and
there
were
gigantic
solenoids
at
each
end
of
each
section
it
was
not
an
experiment
made
at
random
nor
was
the
world
to
which
it
reached
an
unknown
one
to
tommy
or
to
denham
months
before
denham
had
built
an
instrument
which
would
bend
a
ray
of
light
into
the
fifth
dimension
and
had
found
that
he
could
fix
a
telescope
to
the
device
and
look
into
a
new
and
wholly
strange
cosmos
he
had
seen
jungles
and
a
monstrous
red
sun
and
all
the
flora
and
fauna
of
a
planet
in
the
carboniferous
period
of
development
more
by
the
accident
of
its
placing
he
had
seen
the
towers
and
the
pinnacles
of
a
city
whose
walls
and
towers
seemed
plated
with
gold
the
catapult
see
the
january
issue
of
astounding
stories
having
gone
so
far
he
had
devised
a
catapult
which
literally
flung
objects
to
the
surface
of
that
incredible
world
insects
birds
and
at
last
a
cat
had
made
the
journey
unharmed
and
he
had
built
a
steel
globe
in
which
to
attempt
the
journey
in
person
his
daughter
evelyn
had
demanded
to
accompany
him
and
he
believed
it
safe
the
trip
had
been
made
in
security
but
return
was
another
matter
a
laboratory
assistant
von
holtz
had
sent
them
into
the
fifth
dimension
only
to
betray
them
one
king
jacaro
lord
of
chicago
racketeers
was
convinced
by
him
of
the
existence
of
the
golden
city
of
that
other
world
and
that
it
was
full
of
delectable
loot
he
offered
a
bribe
past
envy
for
the
secret
of
denham
apparatus
and
von
holtz
had
removed
the
apparatus
for
denham
return
before
working
the
catapult
to
send
him
on
his
strange
journey
he
wanted
to
be
free
to
sell
full
privileges
of
rapine
and
murder
to
jacaro
the
result
was
unexpected
von
holtz
could
not
unravel
the
secret
of
the
catapult
he
himself
had
operated
he
could
not
sell
the
secret
for
which
he
had
committed
a
crime
in
desperation
he
called
in
tommy
reames
rather
more
than
an
amateur
in
mathematical
physics
showed
him
evelyn
and
her
father
marooned
in
a
jungle
and
hypocritically
asked
for
aid
tommy
enthusiastic
efforts
soon
became
more
than
merely
enthusiastic
the
men
of
the
golden
city
remained
invisible
but
there
were
strange
outlaws
of
the
jungles
who
hated
the
city
tommy
reames
had
watched
helplessly
as
they
hunted
for
the
occupants
of
the
steel
globe
he
had
worked
frenziedly
to
achieve
a
rescue
in
the
course
of
his
labor
he
discovered
the
treachery
of
von
holtz
as
well
as
the
secret
of
the
catapult
and
with
the
aid
of
smithers
who
had
helped
to
build
the
original
catapult
he
made
a
new
small
device
to
achieve
the
original
end
the
whole
affair
came
to
an
end
on
one
mad
afternoon
when
the
ragged
men
captured
first
an
inhabitant
of
the
golden
city
and
then
denham
and
evelyn
in
a
forlorn
attempt
at
rescue
tommy
reames
went
mad
he
used
a
tiny
gun
upon
the
ragged
men
through
the
model
magnetic
catapult
he
had
made
and
contrived
communication
with
denham
afterward
instructed
by
denham
he
brought
about
the
return
of
father
and
daughter
to
earth
just
before
ragged
men
and
earthling
alike
would
have
perished
in
a
vengeful
gas
cloud
from
the
golden
city
even
then
though
his
triumph
was
incomplete
because
von
holtz
had
gotten
word
to
jacaro
and
gunmen
raided
the
laboratory
and
made
off
with
the
model
catapult
leaving
three
bullets
in
tommy
and
one
in
smithers
as
souvenirs
now
using
the
principle
developed
in
the
catapult
tommy
and
denham
had
built
a
large
tube
and
as
tommy
climbed
along
its
corrugated
interior
he
knew
a
good
part
of
what
he
should
expect
at
the
other
end
a
steady
current
of
air
blew
past
him
it
was
laden
with
a
myriad
unfamiliar
scents
the
tube
was
a
tunnel
from
one
set
of
dimensions
to
another
a
permanent
way
from
earth
to
a
strange
planet
on
which
a
monstrous
sun
shone
hotly
tommy
should
come
out
into
a
forest
whose
lush
vegetation
would
hide
the
sky
and
which
furnished
a
lurking
place
not
only
for
strange
reptilian
monsters
akin
to
those
of
the
past
of
earth
but
for
the
bands
of
ragged
human
beings
who
were
outlaws
from
the
civilization
of
which
denham
and
evelyn
had
seen
proofs
tommy
reached
the
third
bend
in
the
tube
by
now
he
had
lost
all
sense
of
orientation
an
object
may
be
bent
through
one
right
angle
only
in
two
dimensions
and
a
second
perfect
right
angle
at
ninety
degrees
to
all
former
paths
only
in
three
dimensions
it
follows
that
a
third
perfect
right
angle
requires
four
dimensions
for
existence
and
four
perfect
right
angles
five
the
tube
bent
itself
through
four
perfect
right
angles
and
since
no
can
ever
have
experience
of
more
than
three
dimensions
plus
time
it
followed
that
tommy
was
experiencing
other
dimensions
than
those
of
earth
as
soon
as
he
passed
the
third
bend
in
short
he
was
in
another
cosmos
there
was
a
moment
of
awful
sickness
as
he
passed
the
third
bend
he
was
hideously
dizzy
when
he
passed
the
fourth
for
a
time
he
felt
as
if
he
had
no
weight
at
all
but
then
quite
abruptly
he
was
climbing
vertically
upward
and
the
soughing
of
fronds
was
loud
in
his
ears
and
suddenly
the
end
of
the
tube
was
under
his
fingers
and
he
stared
out
into
the
world
of
the
fifth
dimension
now
a
gentle
wind
blew
in
his
face
rose
to
incredible
heights
above
his
head
and
now
and
again
by
the
movements
of
their
fronds
he
caught
stray
glimpses
of
unfamiliar
stars
there
were
red
stars
and
blue
ones
and
once
he
caught
sight
of
a
clearly
distinguishable
double
star
of
which
each
component
was
visible
to
the
naked
eye
and
very
very
far
away
he
heard
the
beastly
yellings
he
knew
must
be
the
outlaws
the
ragged
men
feasting
horribly
on
flesh
torn
from
the
quivering
flanks
of
a
monstrous
reptile
something
moved
whimpered
and
fled
suddenly
it
sounded
like
a
human
being
and
tommy
reames
was
struck
with
the
utterly
impossible
conviction
that
he
had
heard
just
that
sound
before
it
was
not
dangerous
in
any
case
and
he
watched
and
listened
and
presently
he
slipped
from
the
mouth
of
the
tube
and
by
the
glow
of
a
flashlight
stripped
foliage
from
nearby
growths
and
piled
it
about
the
mouth
and
then
because
the
purpose
of
the
tube
was
not
adventure
but
science
he
went
back
down
into
the
laboratory
the
three
men
with
evelyn
worked
until
dawn
at
the
rest
of
their
preparations
for
the
use
of
the
tube
all
that
time
the
laboratory
was
filled
with
the
heavy
fragrance
of
a
jungle
upon
an
unknown
planet
the
heavy
scents
of
closed
jungle
blossoms
filled
their
nostrils
the
reek
of
feverishly
growing
green
things
saturated
the
air
a
steady
wind
blew
down
the
tube
and
it
bore
innumerable
unfamiliar
odors
into
the
laboratory
once
a
gigantic
moth
bumped
and
blundered
into
the
tube
and
finally
crawled
heavily
out
into
the
light
it
was
scaled
and
terrible
because
of
its
monstrous
size
but
it
had
broken
a
wing
and
could
not
fly
so
it
crawled
with
feverish
haste
toward
a
brilliant
electric
light
its
eyes
were
especially
horrible
because
they
were
not
compound
like
the
moths
of
earth
they
were
single
like
those
of
a
man
and
were
fixed
in
an
expression
of
utter
fascinated
hypnosis
the
thing
looked
horribly
human
with
those
eyes
staring
from
an
insect
head
and
smithers
killed
it
in
a
flash
of
horror
none
of
them
were
able
to
go
on
with
their
work
until
the
thing
and
its
fascinated
staring
eyes
had
been
put
out
of
sight
then
they
labored
on
with
the
smell
of
the
jungles
of
that
unnamed
planet
thick
about
them
and
noises
now
and
then
coming
down
the
tube
there
were
roars
and
growlings
and
once
there
was
a
thin
high
sound
which
seemed
like
the
scream
of
a
man
chapter
ii
death
tommy
reames
saw
the
red
sun
rise
while
he
was
on
guard
at
the
mouth
of
the
tube
the
above
him
came
into
view
as
vague
gray
outlines
the
stars
grew
pale
and
presently
a
bit
of
crimson
light
peeped
through
the
jungle
somewhere
it
moved
along
the
horizon
and
very
slowly
grew
higher
for
a
moment
tommy
saw
the
huge
ball
that
was
the
sun
of
this
alien
planet
queer
mosses
took
form
and
color
in
the
daylight
displaying
colors
never
seen
on
earth
he
saw
flying
things
dart
among
the
fronds
and
some
were
scaled
and
some
were
not
but
none
of
them
were
feathered
then
a
tiny
buzzing
noise
the
telephone
that
now
rested
below
the
lip
of
the
tube
was
being
used
from
the
laboratory
smithers
will
relieve
you
said
denham
voice
in
the
receiver
come
on
down
we
not
the
only
people
experimenting
with
the
fifth
dimension
jacaro
been
working
and
all
hell
loose
tommy
slid
down
the
tube
in
an
instant
the
four
turns
made
him
sick
and
dizzy
again
but
he
came
out
with
his
jaw
set
grimly
there
was
good
reason
for
tommy
interest
in
jacaro
besides
sides
three
bullet
wounds
tommy
owed
jacaro
something
for
stealing
the
first
model
tube
he
emerged
in
the
laboratory
on
his
hands
and
knees
as
the
size
of
the
tube
made
necessary
smithers
smiled
placidly
at
him
and
crawled
in
to
take
his
place
what
the
devil
happened
demanded
tommy
denham
was
bitter
he
held
a
newspaper
before
him
evelyn
had
brought
coffee
and
the
morning
paper
to
the
laboratory
she
seemed
rather
pale
jacaro
gotten
through
too
snapped
denham
he
gotten
in
a
pack
of
trouble
and
he
loosed
the
devil
on
earth
here
look
he
jabbed
his
finger
at
one
headline
and
here
and
here
he
thrust
at
others
here
proof
the
first
headline
read
king
jacaro
forfeits
bond
smaller
headings
beneath
it
read
racketeer
missing
for
income
tax
trial
bail
forfeited
the
second
headline
was
in
smaller
type
monster
lizard
killed
giant
meat
eater
brought
down
by
rifleman
akin
to
ancient
dinosaurs
say
scientists
jacaro
missing
said
denham
harshly
this
article
says
vanished
and
with
him
a
dozen
of
his
most
prominent
gunmen
you
know
he
had
a
model
catapult
to
duplicate
the
one
he
got
from
you
von
holtz
could
arrange
the
construction
of
a
big
tube
for
him
and
he
knew
about
the
golden
city
look
his
finger
trembling
tapped
on
the
flashlight
picture
of
the
giant
lizard
of
which
the
story
told
and
it
was
a
giant
a
rope
had
upheld
a
colossal
leering
reptilian
head
while
men
with
rifles
posed
beside
the
dead
creature
it
was
as
big
as
a
horse
and
at
first
glance
its
kinship
to
the
extinct
dinosaurs
of
earth
was
plain
huge
teeth
in
sharklike
rows
a
long
trailing
tail
but
there
was
a
collar
about
the
neck
it
had
killed
and
was
devouring
a
cow
when
they
shot
it
said
denham
bitterly
there
been
reports
of
these
creatures
for
days
so
the
news
story
says
they
were
printed
because
nobody
believed
them
but
there
are
a
couple
of
people
missing
a
searching
party
was
hunting
for
them
they
found
this
tommy
reames
stared
at
the
picture
his
face
went
grimmer
still
he
thought
of
sounds
he
had
heard
beyond
the
tube
not
long
since
there
no
question
where
they
came
from
the
fifth
dimension
but
if
jacaro
brought
them
back
he
a
fool
jacaro
missing
said
denham
savagely
do
you
understand
he
could
get
through
to
the
golden
city
these
are
proof
somebody
did
and
these
things
came
down
the
tube
that
somebody
travelled
through
jacaro
would
send
them
but
somebody
did
they
got
collars
around
their
necks
who
sent
them
and
why
tommy
eyes
narrowed
if
civilized
men
found
the
mouth
of
a
tube
it
would
seem
like
the
mouth
of
an
artificial
tunnel
or
a
cave
and
if
annoying
vermin
like
jacaro
gunmen
denham
voice
was
brittle
had
come
out
of
it
why
intelligent
men
might
send
something
living
and
deadly
down
it
as
men
on
earth
will
send
ferrets
down
a
to
wipe
out
the
breed
that
what
happened
jacaro
gone
through
and
attacked
the
golden
city
they
found
his
tube
and
they
sent
these
things
down
if
found
rats
coming
from
a
said
tommy
very
quietly
and
ferrets
went
down
and
did
come
up
we
gas
them
and
so
denham
told
him
so
would
the
golden
city
he
pointed
to
a
boxed
double
paragraph
news
story
under
leaded
headline
poisonous
fog
kills
wild
life
the
story
was
not
alarming
it
said
merely
that
state
game
wardens
had
found
numerous
dead
game
animals
in
a
district
near
coltsville
and
on
investigation
had
found
a
bank
of
mist
all
of
half
a
mile
across
which
seemed
to
have
caused
the
trouble
state
chemists
and
biologists
were
investigating
the
phenomenon
curiously
the
bank
of
mist
seemed
not
to
dissipate
in
a
normal
fashion
samples
of
the
fog
were
being
analyzed
it
was
probably
akin
to
the
belgian
fogs
which
on
several
occasions
had
caused
much
loss
of
life
the
mist
was
especially
interesting
because
in
sunlight
it
displayed
prismatic
colorings
state
troopers
were
warning
the
inhabitants
of
the
neighborhood
the
gassing
started
said
denham
savagely
i
know
a
gas
that
shows
rainbow
colors
the
golden
city
uses
it
so
we
got
to
find
jacaro
tube
and
seal
it
or
only
god
knows
what
will
come
out
of
it
next
i
going
off
tommy
you
and
smithers
guard
our
tube
blow
it
up
if
necessary
it
dangerous
i
get
some
authority
in
albany
and
we
find
jacaro
tube
and
blast
it
shut
tommy
nodded
his
eyes
keen
and
thoughtful
denham
hurried
out
minutes
later
only
they
heard
the
roar
of
a
car
motor
going
down
the
long
lane
away
from
the
laboratory
evelyn
tried
to
smile
at
tommy
it
seems
terrible
dangerous
tommy
considered
and
shrugged
this
news
is
old
he
observed
this
paper
was
printed
last
night
i
think
i
make
a
couple
of
calls
if
the
golden
had
trouble
with
jacaro
it
going
to
make
things
bad
for
us
he
swept
his
eyes
about
and
frowningly
loaded
a
light
rifle
he
put
it
convenient
to
evelyn
hand
and
made
for
the
and
the
telephone
it
was
odd
that
as
he
emerged
into
the
open
air
the
familiar
smells
of
earth
struck
his
nostrils
as
strange
and
unaccustomed
the
laboratory
was
redolent
of
the
forest
into
which
the
tube
extended
and
smithers
was
watching
amid
those
dank
incredible
growths
now
tommy
put
through
calls
seeing
all
his
and
denham
plans
for
a
peaceful
exploration
party
and
amicable
contact
with
the
civilization
of
that
other
planet
utterly
shattered
by
presumed
outrages
by
jacaro
he
made
call
after
call
and
his
demands
for
information
grew
more
urgent
as
he
got
closer
to
the
source
of
trouble
his
cause
for
worry
was
verified
long
before
he
had
finished
even
as
he
made
the
first
call
new
york
newspapers
had
crowded
a
murder
off
their
front
pages
to
make
room
for
the
white
mist
upstate
the
editions
had
termed
it
a
poisonous
fog
the
breakfast
editions
spoke
of
it
as
a
poison
fog
but
it
grew
and
moved
and
by
the
time
tommy
had
a
clear
line
to
get
actual
information
about
it
a
tabloid
had
christened
it
the
death
mist
and
there
were
three
chartered
planes
circling
about
it
for
the
benefit
of
their
newspapers
state
troopers
were
being
reinforced
at
ten
it
was
necessary
to
post
extra
traffic
police
to
take
care
of
the
cars
headed
upstate
to
look
at
the
mystery
at
eleven
it
began
to
move
sluggishly
to
be
sure
and
rather
raggedly
but
it
undoubtedly
moved
and
as
undoubtedly
it
moved
independently
of
the
wind
it
was
at
that
the
first
casualty
occurred
before
that
time
the
police
had
frantically
demanded
that
the
flood
of
sightseers
be
stopped
the
death
mist
covered
a
square
mile
or
more
it
clung
to
the
ground
nowhere
more
than
fifty
or
sixty
feet
high
and
glittered
with
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
it
moved
with
a
velocity
of
anywhere
from
ten
to
twenty
miles
an
hour
in
its
path
were
a
myriad
small
tragedies
nesting
birds
stiff
and
still
and
rabbits
and
other
small
furry
bodies
contorted
in
queer
agonized
postures
but
until
no
human
beings
were
known
to
be
its
victims
then
though
it
was
moving
blindly
across
the
wind
with
a
thin
trailing
edge
behind
it
and
a
rolling
billow
of
descending
mist
as
its
forefront
it
rolled
up
to
and
across
a
concrete
highway
watched
by
perspiring
motor
cops
who
had
performed
miracles
in
clearing
a
path
for
it
among
the
horde
of
sightseeing
cars
it
swept
on
into
a
spindling
pine
wood
behind
it
lay
a
thinning
sheet
of
vapor
thick
white
mist
which
seemed
to
rise
and
move
more
swiftly
to
overtake
the
main
body
it
lay
across
the
highway
in
a
sheet
which
was
ten
feet
deep
then
thinned
to
six
to
three
the
mist
was
no
more
than
a
foot
thick
when
a
party
of
motorists
essayed
to
drive
through
it
as
through
a
sheet
of
water
they
dodged
a
swearing
motorcycle
cop
and
yelling
hilariously
plunged
forward
it
happened
that
they
had
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
to
go
so
the
whole
thing
was
plainly
seen
the
car
was
ten
yards
across
the
sheet
of
mist
before
the
effect
of
its
motion
was
apparent
then
the
mist
torn
by
the
swirled
madly
in
their
wake
the
motorists
yelled
delightedly
there
is
a
picture
extant
taken
at
just
this
moment
it
shows
the
driver
with
a
foolish
grin
on
his
face
clutching
the
wheel
and
very
obviously
stepping
on
the
accelerator
a
pandemonium
of
triumphant
hilarious
shouting
and
then
a
very
sudden
silence
the
car
roared
on
the
road
curved
slightly
the
car
did
not
it
went
off
the
road
turned
over
and
its
engine
shrieked
itself
into
silence
the
death
mist
went
on
draining
from
the
roadway
to
follow
the
tall
cloud
it
moved
swiftly
and
blindly
to
the
circling
planes
above
it
it
seemed
like
a
blind
thing
imagining
itself
confined
and
searching
for
the
edges
of
its
prison
it
gave
an
uncanny
impression
of
being
directed
by
intelligence
but
the
death
mist
itself
was
not
alive
neither
were
the
occupants
of
the
motor
car
when
tommy
got
back
to
the
laboratory
after
his
last
call
for
news
he
found
evelyn
in
the
act
of
starting
to
fetch
him
smithers
called
she
said
uneasily
he
says
something
moving
about
the
buzzer
of
the
telephone
was
humming
stridently
tommy
answered
quickly
just
want
you
handy
said
smithers
calm
voice
i
might
have
to
duck
some
ragged
men
are
chasin
something
get
set
will
ya
ready
for
anything
tommy
assured
him
then
he
made
it
true
rifles
handy
a
gun
grenades
gas
masks
he
handed
one
to
evelyn
smithers
had
one
already
then
tommy
waited
grimly
ready
by
the
the
warm
breeze
blew
upon
him
straining
his
ears
he
could
hear
the
sound
of
fronds
clashing
in
the
wind
he
heard
the
louder
sounds
made
by
smithers
stirring
ever
so
slightly
in
the
tube
and
then
he
caught
a
vague
distant
uproar
it
would
have
been
faint
and
confused
at
best
but
the
tube
was
partly
blocked
by
smithers
body
and
there
were
the
multiple
bends
further
to
complicate
the
echoes
it
was
no
more
than
a
formless
tumult
through
which
faint
yells
came
occasionally
it
drew
nearer
and
nearer
tommy
heard
smithers
stir
suddenly
almost
as
if
he
had
jumped
then
there
were
scrapings
which
could
only
mean
one
thing
smithers
was
climbing
out
of
the
tube
into
the
jungle
of
the
world
the
noise
rose
abruptly
to
a
roar
as
the
muffling
effect
of
body
was
removed
the
yells
were
sharp
and
savage
and
half
mad
there
was
a
sudden
crackling
sound
and
a
voice
screamed
the
hair
rose
at
the
back
of
tommy
neck
then
there
came
the
deafening
report
of
an
automatic
pistol
roaring
itself
empty
above
the
end
of
the
tube
smithers
voice
vastly
calm
it
reames
do
worry
a
second
pistol
took
up
the
fusillade
yells
and
howls
and
screams
arose
men
fled
something
came
crashing
to
the
mouth
of
the
tube
smithers
voice
again
with
purring
note
in
it
get
down
there
hold
off
then
single
deliberately
spaced
shots
while
something
came
stumbling
fumbling
squirming
down
through
the
tube
so
filling
it
that
smithers
shooting
was
muted
then
came
the
subtly
different
explosions
of
the
very
pistols
discharging
gas
bombs
and
tommy
drew
back
his
jaw
set
and
he
stood
with
his
weapons
very
ready
indeed
and
a
scratched
bleeding
exhausted
panting
human
being
in
the
tattered
costume
of
earth
crawled
from
the
tube
and
groveled
on
the
floor
before
him
evelyn
gave
a
little
exclamation
partly
of
disgust
and
partly
of
horror
because
this
man
who
had
had
come
from
the
world
of
the
fifth
dimension
was
wholly
familiar
he
was
tall
and
he
was
lean
emaciated
now
he
wept
sobbingly
behind
spectacles
and
his
lips
were
far
too
full
and
red
his
name
was
von
holtz
he
had
once
been
laboratory
assistant
to
professor
denham
and
he
had
betrayed
evelyn
and
her
father
to
the
most
ghastly
of
possible
fates
for
a
bribe
offered
him
by
jacaro
now
he
groveled
he
was
horrible
to
look
at
where
he
was
not
scratched
and
torn
his
flesh
was
reddened
as
if
by
fire
he
was
exhausted
and
trembling
with
an
awful
terror
and
he
gasped
out
abject
placatory
ejaculations
and
suddenly
collapsed
into
a
sobbing
mass
on
the
floor
smithers
emerged
from
the
tube
with
a
look
of
unpleasant
satisfaction
on
his
face
i
chased
off
the
ragged
men
with
sneeze
gas
he
observed
with
a
vast
calmness
they
ai
comin
back
for
a
while
an
i
always
wanted
to
break
this
guy
neck
i
think
i
do
it
now
not
till
i
questioned
him
said
tommy
savagely
he
and
jacaro
have
started
hell
to
popping
with
that
tube
design
they
stole
from
me
he
got
to
stay
alive
and
tell
us
how
to
stop
it
von
holtz
talk
and
talk
quick
or
back
you
go
through
the
tube
for
the
ragged
men
to
work
on
chapter
iii
tommy
watched
smithers
drive
away
the
sun
was
sinking
low
toward
the
west
and
the
car
stirred
up
a
cloud
of
dust
as
it
sped
down
the
long
narrow
lane
to
the
main
road
the
laboratory
had
intentionally
been
built
in
an
isolated
spot
but
at
the
moment
tommy
would
have
given
a
good
deal
for
a
few
men
nearby
smithers
was
taking
von
holtz
to
albany
to
add
his
information
to
denham
pleas
denham
had
ordered
it
when
they
reached
him
by
phone
after
hours
of
effort
smithers
had
to
go
to
guard
against
von
holtz
escape
even
sick
and
ill
as
he
was
and
evelyn
had
refused
to
go
with
him
if
i
stay
in
the
laboratory
she
insisted
fiercely
you
can
slip
down
and
i
can
blow
up
the
tube
after
you
if
the
ragged
men
stay
away
but
by
yourself
tommy
did
not
consent
but
he
was
helpless
there
was
danger
from
the
tube
not
only
from
ghastly
animals
which
might
come
through
but
from
men
smithers
had
fought
the
ragged
men
above
it
he
had
chased
them
off
but
they
would
come
back
perhaps
they
would
come
very
soon
perhaps
not
until
denham
and
smithers
had
returned
if
they
could
be
held
off
the
as
yet
unknown
dangers
from
the
other
tube
of
which
only
the
lizards
and
the
death
mist
were
certainties
might
be
counteracted
in
any
case
the
tube
must
not
be
destroyed
until
its
defense
was
hopeless
tommy
made
up
a
grim
bundle
to
go
through
the
tube
with
him
the
gun
extra
drums
of
shells
more
gas
bombs
and
half
a
dozen
grenades
he
hung
the
various
objects
about
himself
evelyn
watched
him
miserably
you
you
be
careful
tommy
nothing
else
but
said
tommy
he
grinned
reassuringly
nothing
to
it
really
just
sitting
still
listening
if
i
pop
off
some
fireworks
i
just
have
to
sit
down
and
watch
them
run
he
settled
his
gas
mask
about
his
neck
and
started
to
enter
the
tube
evelyn
touched
his
arm
i
frightened
tommy
shucks
said
tommy
also
a
couple
of
he
stood
up
put
his
arms
about
her
and
kissed
her
until
she
smiled
feel
better
now
he
asked
interestedly
fine
said
tommy
and
grinned
again
when
you
feel
scared
again
ring
me
on
the
phone
and
i
give
you
another
treatment
but
her
smile
faded
as
beaming
at
her
he
crawled
into
the
first
section
of
the
tube
and
his
own
expression
grew
serious
enough
when
she
could
see
him
no
longer
the
situation
was
not
comfortable
evelyn
intended
to
marry
him
and
he
had
to
keep
her
cheerful
but
he
wished
she
were
well
away
from
here
he
tried
to
move
cautiously
through
the
tube
but
his
bundles
bumped
and
rattled
it
seemed
hours
before
he
was
climbing
up
the
last
section
into
the
jungle
he
was
caution
itself
as
he
peered
over
the
edge
it
was
already
night
upon
earth
but
here
the
monstrous
sun
was
barely
sinking
it
moved
slowly
along
the
horizon
as
it
dipped
but
presently
a
gray
cast
come
over
the
colorings
in
the
forest
flying
things
came
clattering
homeward
through
the
masses
of
overhead
he
saw
a
thing
with
a
lizard
head
and
jaws
go
darting
through
an
incredibly
small
opening
it
seemed
to
have
no
wings
at
all
but
then
in
one
instant
a
vast
flashed
out
made
a
single
gigantic
flap
and
the
thing
was
a
projectile
again
darting
through
a
of
interlaced
fronds
without
a
sign
of
wings
to
support
it
tommy
inspected
his
surroundings
with
an
infinite
care
as
the
darkness
deepened
he
meditatively
taped
a
flashlight
below
the
barrel
of
the
gun
turned
on
it
would
cast
a
pitiless
light
upon
his
target
and
the
sights
would
be
silhouetted
against
the
thing
to
be
killed
he
hung
his
grenades
in
a
handy
row
just
inside
the
mouth
of
the
tube
and
set
his
gas
bombs
conveniently
in
place
then
settled
down
to
watch
it
was
assuredly
necessary
von
holtz
story
confirmed
his
own
and
denham
guesses
and
made
their
worst
fears
seem
optimistic
von
holtz
had
made
a
tube
for
jacaro
working
from
the
model
of
tommy
own
construction
it
had
been
completed
nearly
a
month
before
but
no
jungle
odors
had
seeped
through
that
other
tube
on
its
completion
it
opened
in
a
of
a
structure
in
the
golden
city
itself
the
city
of
towers
and
soaring
spires
denham
had
glimpsed
long
months
before
by
sheer
fortune
it
opened
upon
a
rarely
used
storeroom
where
improbable
small
animals
the
equivalent
of
rats
played
obscenely
in
the
light
of
panels
in
the
wall
for
two
days
of
the
world
jacaro
and
his
gunmen
lay
quiet
during
two
nights
they
made
infinitely
cautious
reconnaissance
the
second
night
it
was
necessary
to
kill
two
men
who
sighted
the
tiny
exploring
party
but
the
killing
was
done
with
silenced
automatics
and
there
was
no
alarm
the
third
night
they
lay
still
fearing
an
ambush
the
fourth
night
jacaro
struck
he
and
his
men
fled
back
to
their
tube
with
plunder
and
precious
gems
their
loot
was
vast
even
beyond
their
hopes
though
they
had
killed
other
men
in
gathering
it
the
golden
city
was
rich
beyond
belief
the
very
crust
of
the
world
seemed
to
be
composed
of
other
substances
than
those
of
earth
the
common
metals
of
earth
were
rare
or
even
unknown
the
rarer
metals
of
earth
were
the
commonplace
ones
in
the
golden
city
even
the
roofs
seemed
plated
with
gold
but
jacaro
gunmen
saw
not
one
particle
of
iron
save
in
a
ring
they
took
from
a
dead
man
finger
there
an
plate
of
steel
was
set
as
if
to
be
used
for
a
signet
von
holtz
had
accompanied
the
raiders
perforce
on
every
journey
jeweled
bearings
for
motors
objects
of
commonest
use
made
of
gold
beat
thin
for
lightness
huge
ingots
of
silver
for
industry
once
a
spool
of
platinum
wire
that
it
took
two
men
to
carry
these
things
made
up
the
loot
they
scurried
back
to
their
rathole
with
five
raids
they
made
and
twenty
men
they
shot
down
before
they
came
upon
disaster
on
the
sixth
raid
an
outcry
rose
and
an
ambush
fell
upon
them
flashes
of
incredibly
vivid
actinic
flame
leaped
from
queer
engines
that
opened
upon
them
curious
small
truncheonlike
weapons
spat
paralyzing
electric
shocks
upon
them
the
twelve
gangsters
fought
with
the
desperation
of
cornered
rats
with
notched
and
explosive
bullets
and
with
streams
of
lead
from
a
chance
bullet
blew
something
up
one
of
the
flame
weapons
flew
to
bits
spouting
what
seemed
to
be
liquid
thermit
upon
friend
and
foe
alike
the
way
of
the
gangsters
back
to
their
tube
was
barred
the
route
they
knew
was
a
chaos
of
scorched
bodies
and
melting
metal
the
thermit
flowed
in
all
directions
seeming
to
grow
in
volume
as
it
flamed
jacaro
and
his
gangsters
fled
they
broke
through
the
shaken
remnants
of
the
ambush
the
six
of
them
who
survived
the
fighting
found
a
man
somnolently
driving
a
ground
vehicle
with
two
wheels
they
burst
upon
him
and
with
their
scared
faces
constituting
threats
in
themselves
forced
him
to
drive
them
out
of
the
golden
city
they
fled
along
aluminum
roads
into
the
forests
while
the
sky
behind
them
seemed
to
flame
as
the
city
woke
to
the
tumult
in
its
ways
they
killed
the
driver
of
their
vehicle
when
he
refused
to
take
them
farther
and
it
was
that
murder
which
saved
their
lives
it
was
seen
by
ragged
men
the
outlaws
of
the
jungle
and
it
proved
their
enmity
to
the
golden
city
the
ragged
men
greeted
them
joyously
and
fed
them
and
enlisted
their
aid
in
a
savage
attack
on
a
on
the
way
to
the
city
their
weapons
carried
the
convoy
and
they
watched
wounded
prisoners
killed
with
excruciating
tortures
they
were
with
the
ragged
men
now
von
holtz
believed
he
had
fled
a
week
or
more
before
when
jacaro
already
learning
the
language
of
his
allies
began
to
plan
a
grandiose
attack
upon
the
golden
city
von
holtz
was
born
a
coward
and
he
knew
where
tommy
reames
and
denham
would
shortly
thrust
a
tube
through
it
would
come
out
just
where
the
catapult
had
flung
evelyn
and
denham
months
before
the
same
spot
where
he
had
marooned
them
he
searched
desperately
for
that
tube
and
failed
to
find
it
he
was
chased
by
carnivores
scratched
by
thorns
and
at
last
pursued
by
a
yelling
horde
of
human
devils
who
were
fired
into
by
smithers
from
the
mouth
of
the
tube
tommy
debated
the
story
grimly
as
he
stood
guard
in
the
tube
in
the
humid
jungle
night
stars
winked
fitfully
through
the
thatch
of
giant
ferns
overhead
the
wind
soughed
unsteadily
above
the
jungle
there
were
queer
creakings
and
once
or
twice
there
were
distant
cries
and
when
the
wind
died
down
there
was
a
croaking
audible
somewhere
which
sounded
rather
like
the
croaking
of
unthinkably
monstrous
frogs
but
it
could
not
be
that
of
course
and
once
there
was
the
sound
of
dainty
movement
and
something
passed
nearby
tommy
reames
saw
the
shadowy
outline
of
a
bulk
so
vast
that
it
turned
him
cold
to
think
about
it
and
it
did
not
seem
fair
for
any
creature
as
huge
as
that
to
move
so
quietly
then
there
was
a
little
scuffling
noise
beneath
him
a
hand
touched
his
foot
it
it
me
tommy
evelyn
crowded
up
beside
him
and
whispered
shakenly
it
it
was
so
lonesome
down
there
so
quiet
tommy
frowned
unhappily
in
the
darkness
if
he
sent
her
back
she
would
know
it
was
because
he
knew
danger
lurked
here
then
she
would
worry
if
he
did
not
send
her
back
i
go
back
the
minute
you
tell
me
she
insisted
forlornly
honestly
but
i
was
lonesome
tommy
slipped
his
arm
about
her
woman
he
said
sternly
i
going
to
let
you
stay
ten
minutes
so
you
can
brag
to
our
grandchildren
that
you
were
the
first
ever
to
be
kissed
in
the
fifth
dimension
but
i
want
you
down
in
the
laboratory
so
you
wo
be
in
my
way
if
i
start
running
his
tone
was
the
right
one
she
even
laughed
a
little
softly
as
he
pressed
her
to
him
then
she
clung
to
his
hand
and
tried
eagerly
to
pierce
the
darkness
all
about
them
you
be
able
to
see
something
presently
he
assured
her
in
a
low
tone
just
keep
quiet
now
she
gazed
up
at
the
stars
then
around
in
the
complete
obscurity
tommy
answered
her
comments
abstractedly
after
a
little
he
was
not
quite
sure
that
certain
irregular
sounds
yet
far
distant
were
not
actually
quite
regular
ones
the
ragged
men
smithers
had
shot
into
had
run
away
but
they
would
come
back
and
they
might
come
with
jacaro
and
his
gunmen
as
allies
if
those
distant
sounds
were
men
she
withdrew
her
hand
from
his
her
back
was
toward
him
then
as
she
tried
to
pierce
the
darkness
with
her
eyes
tommy
listened
uneasily
to
the
distant
sound
suddenly
he
felt
evelyn
bump
against
his
shoulder
he
turned
sharply
and
she
was
out
of
the
tube
she
was
walking
steadily
off
into
the
darkness
evelyn
evelyn
she
did
not
falter
or
turn
he
switched
on
the
flashlight
beneath
his
gun
barrel
and
leaped
out
of
the
tube
himself
the
light
swept
about
evelyn
lithe
figure
kept
moving
away
from
him
then
his
heart
stood
still
there
were
eyes
beyond
her
in
the
darkness
huge
monstrous
steady
eyes
half
a
yard
apart
in
a
head
like
something
out
of
hell
and
he
could
not
fire
because
evelyn
was
between
the
thing
and
himself
its
eyes
glowed
unholily
fascinating
hypnotic
insane
evelyn
swayed
and
the
thing
moved
tommy
leaped
like
a
madman
shouting
as
his
feet
struck
the
ground
a
mass
of
fungus
gave
way
beneath
him
he
fell
sprawling
but
clutching
the
gun
fast
the
spreading
beam
of
the
flashlight
showed
him
evelyn
turning
her
face
filled
with
a
wakening
horror
the
horror
of
one
released
from
the
fascination
of
a
snake
she
screamed
his
name
then
a
huge
lizard
paw
swept
forward
and
seized
her
body
a
second
gripped
her
as
she
screamed
again
and
tommy
reames
was
deathly
terribly
cool
the
whole
thing
had
happened
in
seconds
only
he
was
submerged
in
slimy
sticky
ooze
which
was
the
crushed
fungus
that
had
tripped
him
but
he
cleared
the
gun
the
flashlight
limned
a
ghastly
obscenely
fat
body
and
a
long
tapering
tail
tommy
aimed
at
the
base
of
that
tail
and
pulled
the
trigger
praying
frenziedly
a
stream
of
flame
leaped
from
the
explosive
bullets
uttered
their
queer
cracking
noise
the
thing
screamed
horribly
its
cry
was
hoarsely
shrill
the
flashlight
showed
it
swinging
ponderously
about
with
evelyn
held
fast
against
its
body
in
a
fashion
horribly
reminiscent
of
a
child
holding
a
doll
tommy
was
scrambling
upright
jaws
clamped
cold
horror
filling
him
he
aimed
again
at
the
head
above
evelyn
body
he
could
not
try
a
heart
shot
with
her
in
the
way
again
the
gun
spat
out
a
burst
of
explosive
lead
and
tommy
should
have
been
sickened
by
the
effect
of
detonating
missiles
the
thing
lower
jaw
was
shattered
half
severed
made
useless
it
should
have
been
killed
a
dozen
times
over
but
it
screamed
again
until
the
jungle
rang
with
the
uproar
and
then
it
fled
still
screaming
and
still
holding
evelyn
clutched
fast
against
its
scaly
breast
chapter
iv
tommy
flung
himself
in
pursuit
despairing
evelyn
cried
out
once
more
as
the
lumbering
thing
fled
with
her
giving
utterance
to
shrieking
outcries
at
which
the
jungle
shook
it
leaped
once
upon
monstrous
hind
legs
but
came
crashing
heavily
to
the
ground
explosive
bullets
had
shattered
the
bones
which
supported
the
balancing
tail
now
that
huge
fleshy
member
dragged
uselessly
the
thing
could
not
progress
in
its
normal
fashion
of
leaps
covering
many
yards
it
began
to
waddle
clumsily
shrieking
with
evelyn
clasped
close
its
jaw
was
a
shattered
horror
it
went
marching
insanely
through
the
blackness
of
the
jungle
and
with
it
went
the
unholy
din
of
its
anguish
and
behind
it
tommy
reames
came
flinging
himself
frenziedly
in
pursuit
normally
the
thing
should
have
distanced
him
in
seconds
even
crippled
as
it
was
it
moved
swiftly
the
scaly
head
reared
a
good
twenty
feet
above
the
fallen
fronds
which
carpeted
the
jungle
the
monstrous
splayed
feet
stretched
a
good
yard
and
a
half
from
front
to
rear
upon
the
ground
even
its
waddling
footprints
were
yards
apart
and
it
moved
in
terror
tommy
tripped
fell
and
got
to
his
feet
again
and
the
shrieking
tumult
was
farther
away
he
raced
madly
toward
the
sound
the
flashlight
beam
cutting
swordlike
through
the
blackness
he
caught
sight
of
the
warty
scaly
bulk
of
the
monster
at
the
extreme
limit
of
the
rays
it
was
moving
faster
than
he
could
travel
he
sobbed
helpless
curses
at
the
thing
and
put
forth
superhuman
exertions
he
leaped
fallen
trunks
he
splashed
through
shallow
ponds
later
when
he
knew
something
of
the
inhabitants
of
such
pools
tommy
would
turn
cold
at
that
memory
and
raced
on
gasping
for
breath
while
the
shrieking
of
the
thing
that
bore
evelyn
grew
more
and
more
distant
in
five
minutes
he
was
almost
strangling
and
the
thing
was
half
a
mile
ahead
of
him
in
ten
he
was
exhausted
and
the
shrieking
noise
it
made
as
it
waddled
away
was
distinctly
fainter
in
fifteen
minutes
he
only
heard
its
hooting
scream
between
the
harsh
laboring
rasps
of
his
own
breath
as
he
drew
it
into
tortured
lungs
but
he
ran
on
he
leaped
and
climbed
and
ran
in
a
terrible
obliviousness
to
all
dangers
the
jungle
might
hold
he
leaped
down
from
one
toppled
upon
what
seemed
be
another
but
the
thing
he
landed
upon
gave
beneath
his
boots
in
the
unmistakable
fashion
of
yielding
flesh
something
vast
and
angry
stirred
and
hissed
furiously
something
a
head
perhaps
whipped
toward
him
among
the
fallen
but
he
was
racing
on
sobbing
cursing
praying
all
at
once
then
suddenly
he
broke
out
into
a
profuse
sweat
his
breathing
became
easier
and
then
he
was
running
lightly
his
second
wind
had
come
to
him
he
was
no
longer
exhausted
he
felt
as
if
he
could
run
forever
and
ran
on
more
swiftly
still
suddenly
the
flashlight
beam
showed
him
a
deep
furrow
in
the
rotting
vegetation
underfoot
and
something
glistened
a
musky
reek
filled
his
nostrils
the
thing
trail
the
furrow
left
by
its
dragging
tail
that
musky
reek
was
the
blood
it
was
bleeding
from
the
wounds
the
explosive
bullets
had
made
it
was
spouting
whatever
filthy
fluid
ran
in
its
veins
even
as
it
waddled
onward
screaming
five
minutes
more
and
he
felt
that
he
was
gaining
on
it
then
and
he
was
sure
of
it
but
it
was
half
an
hour
before
he
actually
overtook
the
injured
monster
marching
like
a
mad
machine
its
mutilated
ducklike
head
held
high
its
colossal
feet
lifting
one
after
the
other
in
a
heavy
slowing
waddle
and
its
hoarse
screams
in
a
senseless
uproar
of
agony
tommy
hands
were
shaking
but
his
brain
was
cool
with
a
vast
coolness
he
raced
past
the
shrieking
monster
and
halted
in
its
path
he
saw
evelyn
a
huddled
bundle
clasped
still
to
the
creature
scaly
breast
and
tommy
sent
a
burst
of
explosive
bullets
into
a
gigantic
foot
thick
the
monster
toppled
and
flung
out
its
prehensile
lizard
claws
in
an
instinctive
effort
to
catch
itself
evelyn
was
thrown
clear
and
tommy
standing
alone
in
the
blackness
of
a
carboniferous
jungle
upon
an
alien
planet
sent
bullet
after
bullet
into
the
shaking
obscenely
flabby
body
of
the
thing
the
bullets
penetrated
and
exploded
great
masses
of
flesh
upheaved
and
fell
away
great
gouts
of
awful
smelling
fluid
were
flung
out
and
blown
to
mist
by
the
explosions
the
thing
did
not
so
much
die
as
disintegrate
under
the
storm
of
detonating
missiles
then
tommy
went
to
evelyn
he
was
wild
with
grief
he
had
no
faintest
hope
that
she
could
still
be
living
but
as
he
picked
her
up
she
moaned
softly
and
when
he
cried
her
name
she
clung
to
him
pressing
close
in
an
agony
of
thankfulness
almost
as
devastating
as
her
fear
had
been
it
was
minutes
before
either
of
them
could
think
of
anything
other
than
her
safety
and
the
fact
that
they
were
together
again
but
then
tommy
said
in
a
shaken
effort
to
be
himself
again
i
i
have
done
better
if
if
i
had
roller
skates
maybe
his
grin
was
wholly
unconvincing
why
you
get
out
of
the
tube
its
eyes
evelyn
shuddered
her
own
eyes
hidden
against
shoulder
i
saw
them
suddenly
looking
at
me
and
i
had
any
will
i
felt
myself
getting
out
of
the
tube
and
walking
toward
it
it
was
like
the
way
a
snake
fascinates
hypnotizes
a
bird
a
vagrant
submerged
them
in
the
foul
reek
of
the
dead
thing
flesh
tommy
stirred
ugh
let
get
out
of
this
there
be
things
coming
to
feed
on
that
carcass
they
smell
it
evelyn
tried
to
stand
and
succeeded
she
clung
to
his
hand
do
you
think
you
can
find
the
tube
again
tommy
was
already
thinking
of
that
he
grimaced
probably
the
damned
thing
if
the
flashlight
battery
holds
out
its
tail
left
plenty
of
sign
for
us
to
follow
they
started
and
evelyn
had
literally
been
forgotten
in
its
agony
by
the
monster
which
had
carried
her
its
body
though
scaled
and
warty
was
flabby
and
soft
pressed
against
its
breast
she
had
been
half
strangled
but
had
no
injuries
beyond
huge
purple
bruises
which
had
not
yet
reached
the
point
of
stiffness
she
followed
tommy
gamely
and
the
need
for
action
kept
her
from
yielding
to
the
reaction
from
her
terror
for
a
long
long
time
they
less
than
fifteen
minutes
after
leaving
the
carcass
of
the
thing
tommy
had
killed
they
heard
and
the
sound
of
fighting
but
that
noise
died
away
as
they
traveled
presently
they
reached
the
spot
where
tommy
had
leaped
upon
a
huge
living
thing
it
was
gone
now
but
the
impress
of
a
body
the
thickness
of
a
barrel
remained
upon
the
rotted
vegetation
of
the
jungle
floor
evelyn
shivered
when
tommy
pointed
it
out
it
was
large
said
tommy
ruefully
i
did
even
get
a
good
look
it
the
thing
probably
just
as
well
though
i
might
have
been
er
delayed
good
lord
what
that
a
light
had
sprung
into
being
somewhere
it
was
bright
it
was
blinding
in
its
brilliance
coming
through
the
tangled
jungle
growth
it
seemed
as
if
spears
of
flame
shot
through
the
air
irradiating
stray
patches
of
scabrous
with
unbearable
light
for
an
instant
the
illumination
held
then
there
was
a
distant
cracking
detonation
the
unmistakable
explosion
of
split
the
air
and
its
echoes
rolled
and
reverberated
through
the
jungle
the
light
went
out
then
came
a
thin
high
yelling
sound
which
faint
as
it
was
had
something
of
the
quality
of
hysterical
glee
that
crazy
ululation
kept
up
for
several
minutes
evelyn
shivered
the
ragged
men
said
tommy
very
quietly
they
sneaked
up
on
the
tube
they
flung
blazing
thermit
or
something
like
it
with
a
weapon
captured
from
the
golden
city
that
explosion
was
the
grenades
going
off
i
afraid
the
tube
blown
up
evelyn
she
caught
her
breath
looking
mutely
up
at
him
here
a
pistol
he
said
briefly
and
shells
there
no
use
our
going
to
the
tube
it
would
be
dangerous
we
do
our
investigating
at
dawn
he
found
a
crevice
where
trunks
grew
close
together
and
closed
in
three
sides
of
a
sort
of
roofless
cave
he
seated
himself
grimly
at
the
opening
to
wait
for
daybreak
he
was
not
easy
in
his
mind
there
had
been
two
tubes
to
the
world
one
had
been
made
by
jacaro
for
his
gunmen
that
was
now
held
by
the
men
of
the
golden
city
as
was
proved
by
carnivorous
lizards
and
the
death
mist
that
had
come
down
it
the
other
was
now
blown
up
or
worse
in
the
hands
of
the
ragged
men
in
any
case
tommy
and
evelyn
were
isolated
upon
a
strange
planet
in
a
strange
universe
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
ragged
men
was
to
die
horribly
and
the
golden
city
would
not
now
welcome
inhabitants
of
the
world
jacaro
and
his
men
had
come
from
to
the
civilized
men
of
this
world
jacaro
raids
would
seem
invasion
they
would
seem
acts
of
war
on
the
part
of
the
people
of
earth
and
the
people
of
earth
all
of
them
would
seem
enemies
jacaro
would
never
be
identified
as
an
unauthorized
invader
he
would
seem
to
be
a
scout
an
advance
guard
a
spy
for
hordes
of
other
invaders
yet
to
come
as
the
long
night
wore
away
tommy
grim
hopelessness
intensified
the
ragged
men
would
hunt
them
for
sport
and
out
of
hatred
for
all
sane
human
beings
the
men
of
the
golden
city
would
be
merciless
to
compatriots
of
jacaro
gunmen
and
tommy
had
evelyn
to
look
out
for
when
dawn
came
his
face
was
drawn
and
lined
evelyn
woke
with
a
little
gasp
staring
affrightedly
about
her
then
she
tried
gamely
to
smile
morning
tommy
she
said
shakily
she
added
in
a
brave
attempt
at
levity
where
do
we
go
from
here
we
look
at
the
tube
said
tommy
heavily
there
a
bare
chance
he
led
the
way
as
on
the
night
before
with
his
gun
held
ready
they
traveled
for
half
an
hour
through
the
awakening
jungle
then
for
long
long
minutes
tommy
searched
for
a
sign
of
living
men
before
he
ventured
forth
to
look
at
the
wreckage
of
the
tube
he
found
no
live
men
and
only
two
dead
ones
but
a
glimpse
of
their
bestial
faces
was
enough
to
remove
any
regret
for
their
deaths
the
tube
was
shattered
its
mouth
was
belled
out
and
broken
by
the
explosion
of
the
grenades
hung
within
it
a
part
of
the
metal
was
molten
from
the
thermit
past
question
there
was
a
veritable
crater
fifteen
feet
across
where
the
tube
had
come
through
and
there
were
only
shattered
shreds
of
metal
where
the
first
bend
had
been
tommy
regarded
the
wreckage
grimly
a
pair
of
oxidized
copper
wires
their
insulation
burnt
off
stung
his
eyes
as
he
traced
them
to
where
they
vanished
in
earth
he
took
them
in
his
bare
hands
the
tingling
sting
of
a
current
made
his
heart
leap
then
he
smiled
grimly
he
touched
them
to
each
other
s
o
s
if
there
was
anybody
in
the
laboratory
that
would
tell
them
his
hands
stung
sharply
someone
was
there
ringing
the
phone
evelyn
came
toward
him
her
face
resolutely
cheerful
no
hope
tommy
she
asked
i
just
saw
the
telephone
all
battered
up
i
guess
we
pretty
badly
off
get
it
said
tommy
feverishly
for
heaven
sake
get
it
the
phone
wires
were
broken
if
we
can
make
it
work
the
instrument
was
a
wreck
it
was
crumpled
and
torn
and
apparently
useless
the
diaphragm
of
the
receiver
was
punctured
the
transmitter
seemed
to
have
been
crushed
but
tommy
worked
desperately
over
them
and
twisted
the
into
place
hello
hello
hello
the
voice
that
answered
was
smithers
strained
and
fearful
reames
thank
gawd
what
happened
is
miss
evelyn
all
right
so
far
said
tommy
listen
he
told
curtly
just
what
had
happened
now
what
happened
on
earth
hell
panted
smithers
bitterly
hell
been
poppin
the
death
mist
two
miles
across
an
still
growin
an
movin
four
townships
under
martial
law
an
movin
out
the
people
it
got
thirty
of
this
morning
an
they
think
the
professor
crazy
an
nobody

to
him
damn
said
tommy
he
considered
grimly
look
here
von
holtz
ought
to
convince
them
he
caved
in
outa
his
head
before
i
got
to
albany
he
in
hospital
now
ravin
he
got
some
kinda
fever
the
doctors
do
know
about
sick
as
hell
tommy
compressed
his
lips
matters
were
more
desperate
even
than
he
had
believed
he
informed
his
helper
measuredly
evelyn
and
i
ca
stay
around
here
smithers
the
ragged
men
may
come
back
and
it
be
weeks
before
you
and
the
professor
can
get
another
tube
through
i
going
to
make
for
the
golden
city
and
work
on
them
there
to
cut
off
the
death
mist
there
was
an
inarticulate
sound
from
smithers
tell
the
professor
if
he
can
find
jacaro
tube
he
work
out
some
way
to
communicate
through
it
we
got
to
stop
that
death
mist
somehow
and
we
do
know
what
else
they
may
try
smithers
tried
to
speak
and
could
not
he
merely
made
noises
he
worshiped
evelyn
and
she
was
isolated
in
a
hostile
world
which
was
vastly
more
unreachable
than
could
be
measured
by
millions
or
trillions
of
miles
but
at
last
he
said
unsteadily
we
be
comin
reames
we
come
if
we
have
t
blow
half
the
world
apart
tommy
said
grimly
then
hunt
up
the
golden
city
and
bring
extra
ammunition
mostly
explosive
bullets
he
untwisted
the
wires
from
the
shattered
phone
units
and
thrust
them
in
his
pocket
evelyn
was
picking
up
stray
small
objects
from
the
ground
i
found
some
cartridges
tommy
she
said
constrainedly
and
a
pistol
i
think
will
work
then
listen
for
visitors
commanded
tommy
while
i
look
for
more
for
half
in
hour
he
scoured
the
area
around
the
shattered
tube
he
found
where
some
thing
had
been
pushed
to
a
spot
near
the
tube
undoubtedly
the
machine
which
had
sprayed
the
flaming
stuff
upon
it
he
found
two
pockets
full
of
shells
he
found
an
extra
magazine
for
the
gun
it
was
nearly
full
and
only
a
little
bent
that
was
all
now
he
said
briskly
we
start
i
got
a
hunch
the
jungle
thins
out
over
that
way
we
find
a
clearing
try
to
locate
the
golden
city
either
by
seeing
it
or
by
watching
for
aircraft
flying
to
it
and
then
make
for
it
they
making
war
on
earth
there
they
do
understand
we
got
to
make
them
understand
o
evelyn
nodded
she
put
out
her
hand
suddenly
a
brave
slender
figure
amid
the
incredible
growths
about
her
i
glad
tommy
she
said
slowly
that
if
if
anything
happens
it
will
be
the
the
two
of
us
funny
is
it
tommy
kissed
the
twisted
little
smile
from
her
face
and
now
that
that
over
he
observed
ashamed
of
his
own
emotion
let
go
they
went
tommy
watched
the
sun
and
kept
approximately
a
straight
line
they
traveled
three
miles
and
the
jungle
broke
abruptly
before
them
was
a
spongy
surface
neither
solid
earth
or
marsh
it
shelved
gently
down
to
a
vast
and
steaming
morass
upon
which
the
sun
shone
hotly
it
was
vast
that
marsh
and
a
steaming
haze
hung
over
it
and
it
seemed
to
reach
to
the
world
end
but
vaguely
through
the
attenuating
upper
layers
of
the
steamy
haze
they
saw
the
outlines
of
a
city
beyond
tall
towers
and
soaring
spires
buildings
of
a
grace
and
perfection
of
outline
unknown
upon
the
earth
and
faint
golden
flashes
came
from
the
walls
and
pinnacles
of
that
city
they
were
reflections
of
this
planet
monster
sun
upon
walls
and
roofs
of
plated
gold
the
golden
city
said
tommy
heavily
he
looked
at
the
horrible
marsh
between
his
heart
sank
and
then
there
was
a
sudden
screaming
ululation
nearby
a
man
was
running
out
of
sight
two
others
danced
and
capered
and
yelled
in
insane
glee
pointing
at
tommy
and
at
evelyn
the
running
outcry
was
echoed
from
far
away
then
it
was
taken
up
and
repeated
here
and
there
in
the
jungle
they
saw
our
tracks
near
the
tube
snapped
tommy
bitterly
oh
what
a
fool
i
am
now
they
ring
us
in
he
seized
evelyn
hand
and
began
to
run
there
was
a
little
rise
in
the
ground
a
hundred
yards
away
with
a
clump
of
leafy
ferns
to
shade
it
they
reached
it
as
other
wholly
mad
human
forms
burst
out
of
the
jungle
to
yell
and
caper
and
make
derisive
and
horrible
gestures
at
the
fugitives
here
we
fight
said
tommy
grimly
the
ground
open
anyhow
we
fight
here
and
very
probably
we
die
here
but
first
he
knelt
down
and
drew
the
finest
of
fine
beads
upon
a
bearded
man
who
carried
a
glittering
truncheonlike
club
which
by
the
way
it
was
carried
was
more
than
merely
a
bludgeon
he
pulled
the
trigger
for
a
single
shot
the
bullet
struck
the
capering
ragged
man
fairly
in
the
chest
and
it
exploded
chapter
v
fight
in
the
twice
within
the
next
two
hours
the
ragged
men
mustered
the
courage
to
charge
they
came
racing
across
the
ooze
like
the
madmen
they
were
their
yells
and
shouts
were
maniacal
howls
of
or
worse
and
twice
tommy
broke
their
rush
with
a
savage
ruthlessness
the
first
magazine
was
nearly
empty
it
was
an
unhandy
weapon
for
work
but
it
was
loaded
with
explosive
shells
the
second
rush
he
stopped
with
an
automatic
pistol
there
were
bodies
partly
buried
in
the
ooze
all
the
way
from
the
jungle
edge
to
within
ten
yards
of
the
hillock
on
which
he
and
evelyn
had
taken
refuge
it
was
hot
there
terribly
hot
the
air
was
stifling
it
fairly
reeked
of
moisture
and
the
smells
from
the
swamp
behind
them
were
sickening
tommy
began
to
transfer
the
shells
from
the
spare
bent
magazine
to
the
one
he
had
carried
with
the
gun
we
a
couple
of
reasons
to
be
thankful
he
observed
one
is
that
there
a
bit
of
shade
overhead
the
other
is
that
we
had
the
big
magazines
for
this
gun
we
still
have
nearly
ninety
shells
besides
the
ones
for
the
pistols
evelyn
said
soberly
we
going
to
be
killed
do
you
think
tommy
tommy
frowned
i
rather
afraid
we
are
he
said
irritably
confound
it
and
thought
of
such
excellent
arguments
to
use
in
the
city
back
yonder
smithers
said
the
death
mist
was
two
miles
across
and
still
growing
the
people
in
the
city
are
still
pouring
the
stuff
down
through
jacaro
tube
evelyn
smiled
faintly
she
touched
his
hand
trying
to
keep
me
from
worrying
tommy
she
hesitated
until
he
growled
a
question
please
remember
that
when
daddy
and
i
were
in
the
jungle
before
we
saw
what
these
ragged
men
do
to
prisoners
they
take
i
just
want
you
to
promise
that
well
you
wo
wait
too
long
in
hopes
of
somehow
saving
me
tommy
stared
at
her
then
he
decisively
reached
forward
and
put
his
hand
over
her
mouth
keep
quiet
he
said
gently
they
sha
capture
you
i
promise
that
now
keep
quiet
there
was
only
silence
for
a
long
time
now
and
again
a
hidden
figure
screamed
in
rage
at
them
now
and
again
some
flapping
thing
sped
toward
the
jungle
edge
once
a
naked
arm
thrust
one
of
the
golden
truncheons
from
behind
its
cover
pointing
at
a
flying
thing
a
few
yards
overhead
the
flying
thing
suddenly
toppled
turning
over
and
over
before
it
crashed
to
the
ground
there
were
howls
of
glee
they
seem
mad
said
tommy
meditatively
and
they
act
like
lunatics
but
i
got
a
hunch
of
some
sort
about
them
but
what
sunlight
gleamed
on
something
golden
beyond
the
jungle
edge
naked
figures
went
running
to
the
spot
an
exultant
tumult
arose
now
they
try
another
trick
tommy
observed
dispassionately
i
remember
that
at
the
tube
they
had
pushed
something
on
wheels
the
gun
was
unhandy
for
accurate
single
shots
and
no
pistol
can
be
used
to
effect
at
long
ranges
to
conserve
ammunition
tommy
had
been
shooting
only
at
relatively
close
targets
allowing
the
ragged
men
immunity
at
over
two
hundred
yards
but
now
he
flung
over
the
stud
he
watched
grimly
the
foliage
at
the
edge
of
the
jungle
parted
a
crude
wagon
appeared
its
axles
were
lesser
its
wheels
were
clumsy
and
crude
beyond
belief
but
mounted
upon
it
there
was
a
queer
mass
of
golden
metal
which
looked
strangely
beautiful
and
strangely
deadly
that
the
thing
said
tommy
dispassionately
which
made
the
flare
of
light
last
night
it
blew
up
the
tube
and
von
holtz
told
me
hm
his
friends
in
the
city
he
sighted
carefully
the
wagon
and
its
contents
were
surrounded
by
a
leaping
capering
mob
they
shook
their
fists
in
an
insane
hatred
a
storm
of
bullets
burst
upon
them
tommy
was
traversing
the
little
gun
with
the
trigger
pressed
down
his
lips
were
set
tightly
and
suddenly
it
seemed
as
if
the
solid
earth
burst
asunder
there
had
been
an
instant
in
which
the
were
visible
they
tore
and
shattered
the
howling
mob
of
ragged
men
but
then
they
struck
the
golden
weapon
a
sheet
of
flame
leaped
skyward
and
round
about
a
blast
of
blistering
horrible
heat
smote
upon
the
beleaguered
pair
the
moisture
of
the
ooze
between
them
and
the
jungle
flashed
into
steam
a
section
of
the
jungle
itself
a
hundred
yards
across
shriveled
and
died
steam
shot
upward
in
a
monstrous
cloud
miles
high
it
seemed
then
almost
instantly
there
was
nothing
left
of
the
ragged
men
about
the
golden
weapon
or
of
the
weapon
itself
but
an
unbearable
light
which
poured
away
and
trickled
here
and
there
and
seemed
to
grow
in
volume
as
it
flamed
from
the
rest
of
the
jungle
a
howl
arose
it
was
a
howl
of
such
loss
and
of
such
unspeakable
rage
that
the
hair
at
the
back
of
neck
lifted
as
a
dog
hackles
lift
at
sight
of
an
enemy
keep
your
head
down
evelyn
said
tommy
composedly
i
have
an
idea
that
the
burning
stuff
gives
off
a
lot
of
von
holtz
was
badly
burned
you
remember
naked
figures
flashed
forward
from
the
jungle
beyond
the
burned
area
tommy
shot
them
down
grimly
he
discarded
the
gun
with
its
explosive
shells
for
the
automatics
some
of
his
targets
were
only
wounded
those
wounded
men
dragged
themselves
forward
screaming
their
rage
tommy
felt
sickened
as
if
he
were
shooting
down
madmen
a
voice
roared
a
order
from
the
jungle
the
assault
slackened
five
minutes
later
it
began
again
and
this
time
the
attackers
waded
out
into
the
softer
ooze
and
flung
themselves
down
and
then
began
a
progress
behind
bits
of
stump
or
merely
pushing
walls
of
the
jellylike
mud
before
them
the
white
light
expanded
and
grew
huge
but
it
dulled
as
it
expanded
and
presently
seemed
no
hotter
than
molten
steel
and
later
still
it
was
no
more
than
a
heat
and
later
yet
tommy
shot
savagely
some
of
the
ragged
men
died
more
did
not
i
afraid
he
said
coolly
they
going
to
get
us
it
seems
rather
purposeless
but
i
afraid
they
going
to
win
evelyn
thrust
a
shaking
hand
skyward
there
tommy
a
strange
angular
flying
thing
was
moving
steadily
across
the
marsh
barely
above
the
steamlike
haze
that
hung
in
thinning
layers
about
its
foulness
the
flying
thing
moved
with
a
machinelike
steadiness
and
the
sun
twinkled
upon
something
bright
and
shining
before
it
a
flying
machine
said
tommy
shortly
his
mind
leaped
ahead
and
his
lips
parted
in
a
mirthless
smile
get
your
gas
mask
ready
evelyn
the
explosion
of
that
made
them
curious
in
the
city
they
sent
a
ship
to
see
the
flying
thing
grew
closer
grew
distinct
a
wail
arose
from
the
ragged
men
some
of
them
leaped
to
their
feet
and
fled
a
man
came
out
into
the
open
and
shook
his
fists
at
the
angular
thing
in
the
air
he
screamed
at
it
and
such
ghastly
hatred
was
in
the
sound
that
evelyn
shuddered
tommy
could
see
it
plainly
now
its
single
wing
was
thick
and
queerly
unlike
the
of
earth
a
framework
hung
below
it
but
it
had
no
balancing
tail
and
there
was
a
glittering
something
before
it
that
obviously
was
its
propelling
mechanism
but
as
obviously
was
not
a
screw
propeller
it
swept
overhead
with
a
man
in
it
looking
downward
tommy
watched
coolly
it
was
past
him
sweeping
toward
the
jungle
it
swung
sharply
to
the
right
banking
steeply
smoking
things
dropped
from
it
which
expanded
into
columns
of
vapor
they
reached
the
jungle
and
blotted
it
out
the
flying
machine
swung
again
and
swept
back
to
the
left
more
smoking
things
dropped
ragged
men
erupted
from
the
jungle
edge
in
screaming
groups
only
to
writhe
and
fall
and
lie
still
but
a
group
of
five
of
them
sped
toward
tommy
shrieking
their
rage
upon
him
as
the
cause
of
disaster
tommy
held
his
fire
looking
upward
a
hundred
yards
fifty
yards
the
flying
machine
soared
in
easy
effortless
circles
the
man
in
it
was
watching
making
no
effort
to
interfere
tommy
shot
down
the
five
men
one
after
the
other
with
a
curiously
detached
feeling
that
their
faces
would
haunt
him
forever
then
he
stood
up
the
flying
machine
banked
turned
and
swept
toward
him
and
a
smoking
thing
dropped
toward
the
earth
it
was
a
gas
bomb
like
those
that
had
wiped
out
the
ragged
men
it
would
strike
not
ten
yards
away
your
mask
snapped
tommy
he
helped
evelyn
adjust
it
the
billowing
white
cloud
rolled
around
him
he
held
his
breath
clapped
on
his
mask
exhaled
until
his
lungs
ached
and
was
breathing
comfortably
the
mask
was
effective
protection
and
then
he
held
evelyn
comfortably
close
for
what
seemed
a
long
long
while
they
were
surrounded
by
the
white
mist
the
cloud
was
so
dense
indeed
that
the
light
about
them
faded
to
a
gray
twilight
but
gradually
bit
by
bit
the
mist
grew
thinner
then
it
moved
aside
it
drifted
before
the
wind
toward
the
forest
and
was
lost
to
sight
the
flying
machine
was
circling
and
soaring
silently
overhead
as
the
mist
drew
aside
the
pilot
dived
down
and
down
and
tommy
emptied
his
automatic
at
the
glittering
thing
which
drew
it
there
was
a
crashing
bolt
of
blue
light
the
machine
canted
spun
about
with
one
wing
almost
vertical
that
struck
the
marsh
and
it
settled
with
a
monstrous
splashing
of
mud
all
was
still
tommy
reloaded
watching
it
keenly
the
framework
is
smashed
up
anyhow
he
observed
grimly
the
pilot
thinks
we
some
of
jacaro
gang
my
guns
were
proof
to
him
so
since
the
ragged
men
did
get
us
he
gassed
us
he
watched
again
his
eyes
narrow
the
pilot
was
utterly
still
he
may
be
knocked
out
i
hope
so
i
going
to
see
automatic
held
ready
tommy
moved
toward
the
crashed
machine
it
had
splashed
into
the
ooze
less
than
a
hundred
yards
away
tommy
moved
cautiously
twenty
yards
away
the
pilot
moved
feebly
he
had
knocked
his
head
against
some
part
of
his
machine
a
moment
later
he
opened
his
eyes
and
stared
about
the
next
instant
he
had
seen
tommy
and
moved
convulsively
a
glittering
thing
appeared
in
his
hand
and
tommy
fired
the
glittering
thing
flew
to
one
side
and
the
pilot
clapped
his
hand
to
a
punctured
forearm
he
went
white
but
his
jaw
set
he
stared
at
tommy
waiting
for
death
for
the
love
of
pete
said
tommy
irritably
i
not
going
to
kill
you
you
tried
to
kill
me
and
it
was
very
annoying
but
i
have
some
things
i
want
to
tell
you
he
stopped
and
felt
foolish
because
his
words
were
of
course
unintelligible
the
pilot
was
staring
amazedly
at
him
tommy
tone
had
been
irritated
certainly
but
there
was
neither
hatred
nor
triumph
in
it
he
waved
his
hand
come
on
and
i
bandage
you
up
and
see
if
we
can
make
you
understand
a
few
things
evelyn
came
running
through
the
muck
he
did
hurt
you
tommy
she
gasped
i
saw
you
shoot
the
pilot
fairly
jumped
at
first
glance
he
had
recognized
her
as
a
woman
tommy
growled
that
he
had
to
shoot
the
damn
fool
through
the
arm
the
pilot
spoke
curiously
evelyn
looked
at
his
arm
and
exclaimed
he
was
holding
it
above
the
wound
to
stop
the
bleeding
evelyn
looked
about
helplessly
for
something
with
which
to
bandage
it
make
pads
with
your
handkerchief
grunted
tommy
take
my
tie
to
hold
them
in
place
the
prisoner
looked
curiously
from
one
to
the
other
his
color
was
returning
as
evelyn
worked
on
his
arm
he
seemed
to
grow
excited
at
some
inner
thought
he
spoke
again
and
looked
at
once
puzzled
and
confirmed
in
some
conviction
when
they
were
unable
to
comprehend
when
evelyn
finished
her
task
he
smiled
suddenly
flashing
white
teeth
at
them
he
even
made
a
little
speech
which
was
humorously
apologetic
to
judge
by
its
tone
when
they
turned
to
go
back
to
their
fortress
he
went
with
them
without
a
trace
of
hesitation
now
what
asked
evelyn
they
be
looking
for
him
in
a
little
while
said
tommy
curtly
if
we
can
convince
him
we
not
enemies
he
keep
them
from
giving
us
more
gas
the
pilot
was
fumbling
at
a
belt
about
the
curious
tunic
he
wore
tommy
watched
him
warily
but
a
pad
of
what
seemed
to
be
black
metal
came
out
with
a
stylus
attached
to
it
the
pilot
sat
down
the
instant
they
stopped
and
began
to
draw
in
white
lines
on
the
black
surface
he
drew
a
picture
of
a
man
and
an
angular
flying
machine
and
then
a
sketchy
impressionistic
outline
of
a
towers
he
drew
a
circle
to
enclose
all
three
drawings
and
indicated
himself
the
machine
and
the
distant
city
tommy
nodded
comprehension
as
the
pilot
looked
up
then
came
a
picture
of
a
man
shaking
his
fists
at
the
three
encircled
sketches
the
man
stood
beneath
a
roughly
indicated
clever
said
tommy
as
a
larger
circle
enclosed
that
with
the
city
and
the
machine
he
identifying
himself
and
saying
the
ragged
men
are
enemies
of
himself
and
his
golden
city
too
that
much
is
not
hard
to
get
he
nodded
vigorously
as
the
pilot
looked
up
again
and
then
he
watched
as
a
lively
tiny
sketch
grew
on
the
black
slab
showing
half
a
dozen
men
garbed
almost
as
tommy
was
using
weapons
which
could
only
be
guns
and
automatic
pistols
they
were
obviously
gangsters
the
pilot
handed
over
the
plate
and
watched
absorbedly
as
tommy
fumbled
with
the
stylus
he
drew
not
well
but
well
enough
an
outline
of
the
towers
of
new
york
the
difference
in
architecture
was
striking
there
followed
tiny
figures
of
himself
and
evelyn
with
a
drily
murmured
this
is
a
flattering
portrait
of
you
evelyn
and
a
circle
enclosing
them
with
the
towers
of
new
york
the
pilot
nodded
in
his
turn
and
then
tommy
encircled
the
previously
drawn
figures
of
the
gangsters
with
new
york
just
as
the
ragged
men
had
been
linked
with
the
other
city
and
a
second
circle
linked
gangsters
and
ragged
men
together
i
saying
observed
tommy
that
jacaro
and
his
mob
are
the
ragged
men
of
our
world
which
may
not
be
wrong
at
that
there
was
no
question
but
that
the
pilot
took
his
meaning
he
grinned
in
a
friendly
fashion
and
winced
as
his
wounded
arm
hurt
him
ruefully
he
looked
down
at
his
bandage
then
he
pressed
a
tiny
stud
at
the
top
of
the
pad
and
all
the
white
lines
vanished
instantly
he
drew
a
new
circle
with
scattered
about
its
upper
third
a
tiny
sketch
of
a
city
towers
he
pointed
to
that
and
to
the
city
visible
through
the
mist
a
second
city
and
a
third
in
other
places
he
waved
his
hand
vaguely
about
then
impatiently
scribbled
over
the
middle
third
of
the
circle
and
handed
it
back
to
tommy
tommy
grinned
ruefully
a
map
he
said
amusedly
he
pointed
out
his
own
city
and
a
couple
of
others
and
he
wants
us
to
tell
him
where
we
come
from
evelyn
er
how
are
we
going
to
explain
a
trip
through
five
dimensions
in
a
sketch
evelyn
shook
her
head
but
a
shadow
passed
over
their
heads
the
pilot
leaped
to
his
feet
and
shouted
there
were
three
planes
soaring
above
them
and
the
pilot
in
the
first
was
in
the
act
of
releasing
a
smoking
object
over
the
side
at
the
grounded
pilot
shout
he
flung
his
ship
into
a
frantic
dive
while
behind
him
the
smoking
thing
billowed
out
a
thicker
and
thicker
cloud
his
plane
was
nearly
hidden
by
the
vapor
when
he
released
it
it
fell
two
hundred
yards
and
more
away
and
the
white
mist
spread
and
spread
but
it
fell
short
of
the
little
hillock
quick
thinking
said
tommy
coolly
he
thought
we
had
this
man
a
prisoner
and
he
be
better
off
dead
but
their
captive
was
shouting
again
his
head
thrown
back
he
called
sentence
after
sentence
aloft
while
the
three
ships
soared
back
and
forth
above
their
heads
soundless
as
bats
one
of
the
three
rose
steeply
and
soared
away
toward
the
city
their
captive
grinning
turned
and
nodded
his
head
satisfiedly
then
he
sat
down
to
wait
twenty
minutes
later
a
monstrous
machine
with
ungainly
flapping
wings
came
heavily
over
the
swamp
it
checked
and
settled
with
a
terrific
flapping
and
an
even
more
terrific
din
half
a
dozen
armed
men
waited
warily
for
the
three
to
approach
the
golden
weapons
lifted
alertly
as
they
drew
near
the
wounded
man
explained
at
some
length
his
explanation
was
dismissed
brusquely
a
man
advanced
and
held
out
his
hands
for
tommy
weapons
i
do
like
it
growled
tommy
but
we
got
to
think
of
earth
if
you
get
a
chance
hide
your
gun
evelyn
he
pushed
on
the
safety
catches
and
passed
over
his
guns
the
pilot
he
had
shot
down
led
them
onto
the
deck
of
the
monstrous
ornithopter
machinery
roared
the
wings
began
to
beat
they
were
nearly
invisible
from
the
speed
of
their
flapping
when
the
ship
lifted
vertically
from
the
ground
it
rose
straight
up
for
fifty
feet
the
motion
of
the
wings
changed
subtly
and
it
swept
forward
it
swung
in
a
vast
half
circle
and
headed
back
across
the
marsh
for
the
golden
city
five
minutes
of
noisy
flight
during
which
the
machine
flapped
its
way
higher
and
higher
above
the
marsh
which
seemed
more
noisome
and
horrible
still
from
above
and
then
the
golden
towers
of
the
city
were
below
strange
and
tapering
and
beautiful
they
were
no
single
line
was
perfectly
straight
nor
was
any
form
ungraceful
these
towers
sprang
upward
in
curves
toward
the
sky
bridges
between
them
were
gossamerlike
things
that
seemed
lace
spun
out
in
metal
and
as
tommy
looked
keenly
and
saw
the
jungle
crowding
close
against
the
city
metal
walls
the
flapping
of
the
wings
changed
again
and
it
seemed
to
plunge
downward
like
a
stone
toward
a
narrow
landing
place
amid
the
great
city
towering
buildings
chapter
vi
golden
the
thing
that
struck
tommy
first
of
all
was
the
scarcity
of
men
in
the
city
compared
to
its
size
the
next
thing
was
the
entire
absence
of
women
the
roar
of
machines
smote
upon
his
consciousness
as
a
bad
third
though
they
made
din
enough
perhaps
he
ignored
the
machine
noises
because
the
ornithopter
on
which
they
had
arrived
made
such
a
racket
itself
they
landed
on
a
paved
space
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
by
two
hundred
three
sides
of
which
were
walled
off
by
soaring
towers
the
fourth
gave
off
on
empty
space
and
he
realized
that
he
was
still
at
least
a
hundred
feet
above
the
ground
the
ornithopter
landed
with
a
certain
skilful
precision
and
its
wings
ceased
to
beat
behind
it
the
two
machines
soared
down
leveled
hovered
and
settled
upon
amazingly
inadequate
wheels
their
pilots
got
out
and
began
to
push
them
toward
one
side
of
the
landing
area
tommy
noticed
it
of
course
he
was
noticing
everything
just
now
he
said
amazedly
evelyn
they
launch
these
planes
with
catapults
like
those
our
battleships
use
they
do
take
off
under
their
own
power
the
six
men
on
the
ornithopter
put
their
shoulders
to
their
machine
and
trundled
it
out
of
the
way
tommy
blinked
at
the
sight
no
field
attendants
he
gazed
out
across
the
open
portion
of
the
land
area
and
saw
an
elevated
thoroughfare
below
some
sort
of
vehicle
gleaming
like
gold
moved
swiftly
on
two
wheels
there
was
a
walkway
in
the
center
of
the
street
with
room
for
a
multitude
but
only
two
men
were
in
sight
upon
it
lord
said
tommy
where
are
the
people
there
was
brief
talk
among
the
crew
of
the
ornithopter
two
of
them
picked
up
tommy
weapons
and
the
pilot
he
had
wounded
made
a
gesture
indicating
that
he
should
follow
he
led
the
way
to
an
arched
door
in
the
nearest
tower
a
little
car
was
waiting
they
got
into
it
and
the
pilot
fumbled
with
the
controls
as
he
worked
at
it
rather
clumsily
on
account
of
his
arm
the
rest
of
the
ornithopter
crew
came
in
they
wheeled
out
another
vehicle
climbed
into
it
and
shot
away
down
a
sloping
passage
their
own
vehicle
followed
and
emerged
upon
the
paved
and
nearly
empty
thoroughfare
tall
buildings
rose
all
about
them
with
curved
walls
soaring
dizzily
skyward
there
was
every
sign
of
a
populous
city
including
the
dull
drumming
roar
of
many
machines
but
the
streets
were
empty
the
little
machine
moved
swiftly
for
minutes
twice
it
swung
aside
and
entered
a
sloping
incline
once
it
went
up
the
other
time
it
dived
down
seventy
feet
on
a
ramp
then
it
swung
sharply
to
the
right
meandered
into
a
way
leading
into
the
heart
of
a
monster
building
and
stopped
and
in
all
its
travel
it
had
not
passed
fifty
people
the
turned
and
grinned
amiably
and
led
the
way
again
steps
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
then
they
emerged
suddenly
into
a
vast
room
it
must
have
been
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
fifty
wide
and
nearly
as
high
it
was
floored
with
alternate
blocks
of
what
seemed
to
be
an
black
wood
and
the
omnipresent
golden
metal
columns
and
pilasters
about
the
place
gave
forth
the
same
subdued
deep
golden
glow
light
streamed
from
panels
inset
in
the
wall
and
ceiling
a
curious
light
there
was
a
massive
table
of
the
hard
black
wood
chairs
with
curiously
designed
backs
were
ranged
about
it
they
were
benches
really
but
they
served
the
purpose
of
chairs
each
was
too
narrow
to
hold
more
than
one
person
the
room
was
empty
they
waited
after
a
long
time
a
man
in
a
blue
tunic
came
into
the
room
and
sat
down
on
one
of
the
benches
a
long
time
later
another
man
came
in
in
red
and
another
and
another
until
there
were
a
dozen
in
all
they
regarded
tommy
and
evelyn
with
a
weary
suspicion
one
of
them
an
old
man
with
a
white
beard
asked
questions
the
pilot
answered
them
at
a
word
the
two
men
with
tommy
weapons
placed
them
on
the
table
they
were
inspected
casually
as
familiar
things
they
probably
were
since
some
of
jacaro
gunmen
had
been
killed
in
a
fight
in
this
city
another
question
the
pilot
explained
briefly
and
offered
tommy
the
pad
again
it
still
contained
the
incomplete
map
of
a
hemisphere
and
was
obviously
a
repetition
of
the
question
of
where
he
came
from
tommy
took
it
frowning
thoughtfully
then
an
idea
struck
him
he
found
the
little
stud
which
pressed
by
the
pad
owner
had
erased
the
previous
drawings
he
pressed
it
and
the
lines
disappeared
and
tommy
drew
crudely
enough
that
complicated
diagram
which
is
supposed
to
represent
a
cube
which
is
a
cube
in
four
dimensions
a
tesseract
upon
one
surface
of
the
cube
he
indicated
the
curving
towers
of
the
golden
city
upon
a
surface
representing
a
plane
beyond
the
three
dimensions
of
normal
experience
he
repeated
the
angular
tower
structures
of
new
york
he
shrugged
rather
hopelessly
as
he
passed
it
over
but
to
his
amazement
it
was
understood
at
once
the
little
black
pad
passed
from
hand
to
hand
and
an
animated
discussion
took
place
one
rather
man
was
the
most
animated
of
all
the
bearded
old
man
demurred
the
man
insisted
tommy
could
see
that
his
pilot
expression
was
becoming
uneasy
but
then
a
compromise
seemed
to
be
arrived
at
the
bearded
man
spoke
a
single
ceremonial
phrase
and
the
twelve
men
rose
they
moved
toward
various
doors
and
one
by
one
left
until
the
room
was
empty
but
the
pilot
looked
relieved
he
grinned
cheerfully
at
tommy
and
led
the
way
back
to
the
vehicle
the
two
men
with
weapons
vanished
and
again
there
was
a
swift
cyclonelike
passage
along
empty
ways
with
the
throbbing
of
machinery
audible
everywhere
into
the
base
of
a
second
building
up
endless
stairs
past
innumerable
doors
it
seemed
to
tommy
that
he
heard
voices
behind
some
of
them
and
they
were
women
voices
at
a
private
triple
knock
a
door
opened
wide
and
the
pilot
led
the
way
into
a
room
closed
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
and
called
a
woman
voice
cried
out
in
astonishment
through
an
inner
arch
a
woman
came
running
eagerly
her
face
went
blank
at
sight
of
tommy
and
evelyn
and
her
hand
flew
to
a
tiny
golden
object
at
her
waist
then
at
the
pilot
chuckle
she
flushed
vividly
hours
later
tommy
and
evelyn
were
able
to
talk
it
over
they
were
alone
then
and
could
look
out
an
oval
window
upon
the
golden
city
all
about
them
it
was
dark
but
panels
glowed
in
building
walls
all
along
the
thoroughfares
and
tiny
glowing
dots
in
the
soaring
spires
of
gold
told
of
people
within
other
dwellings
like
this
as
i
see
it
said
tommy
restlessly
the
council
and
it
must
have
been
that
in
the
big
room
put
us
in
our
friend
hands
to
learn
the
language
he
been
working
with
me
four
hours
drawing
pictures
and
i
been
writing
down
words
i
learned
i
must
have
several
hundred
of
them
but
we
do
our
best
talking
with
pictures
and
evelyn
this
city
in
a
bad
fix
evelyn
said
irrelevantly
her
name
is
ahnya
tommy
and
she
a
dear
we
got
along
beautifully
i
bet
i
found
out
things
you
do
even
guess
at
you
probably
have
admitted
tommy
frowning
check
up
on
this
our
friend
name
is
aten
and
he
an
and
also
has
something
to
do
with
growing
foodstuffs
in
some
special
towers
where
they
grow
crops
by
artificial
light
only
some
of
the
plants
he
sketched
look
amazingly
like
wheat
by
the
way
the
name
of
the
town
is
he
looked
at
his
notes
yugna
there
are
some
other
towns
ten
or
twelve
of
them
rahn
is
the
nearest
and
it
worse
off
than
this
one
of
course
said
evelyn
smiling
they
use
openly
there
how
you
learn
all
that
demanded
tommy
ahnya
told
me
we
made
gestures
and
smiled
at
each
other
we
understood
perfectly
she
crazy
about
her
husband
and
i
well
she
knows
i
going
to
marry
you
so
tommy
grunted
i
suppose
she
explained
with
a
smile
and
gestures
just
how
much
of
a
strain
it
is
simply
keeping
the
city
going
of
course
said
evelyn
calmly
the
city
fighting
against
the
jungle
which
grows
worse
all
the
time
they
used
to
grow
their
foodstuffs
in
the
open
fields
then
within
the
city
now
they
use
empty
towers
and
artificial
light
i
do
know
why
tommy
grunted
again
this
planet
just
had
or
is
having
a
change
of
geologic
period
he
explained
frowning
the
plants
people
need
to
live
on
adapted
to
the
new
climate
and
new
plants
fit
for
food
are
scarce
they
have
to
grow
food
under
shelter
now
and
their
machines
take
an
abnormal
amount
of
supervision
i
do
know
why
the
for
the
food
plants
the
machines
that
fight
back
the
jungle
creepers
which
thrive
in
the
new
climate
and
try
to
crawl
into
the
city
to
smother
it
the
power
machines
the
clothing
machines
a
million
machines
have
to
be
kept
going
to
keep
back
the
jungle
and
fight
off
starvation
and
just
hold
on
doggedly
to
the
bare
fact
of
civilization
and
they
the
law
of
diminishing
returns
seems
to
operate
they
trying
to
maintain
a
civilization
higher
than
their
environment
will
support
they
work
until
they
ready
to
drop
just
to
stay
in
the
same
place
and
the
monotony
and
the
strain
makes
some
of
them
take
to
for
relief
he
surveyed
the
city
from
the
oval
window
frowning
in
thought
it
a
drug
which
grows
wild
he
added
slowly
it
peps
them
up
it
makes
the
monotony
and
the
weariness
bearable
and
then
suddenly
they
break
they
hate
the
machines
and
the
city
and
everything
they
ever
knew
or
did
it
a
sort
of
psychosis
which
goes
off
with
a
bang
some
of
them
go
amuck
in
the
city
using
their
until
they
killed
more
of
them
bolt
for
the
jungle
the
city
loses
better
than
one
per
cent
of
its
population
a
year
to
the
jungle
and
then
they
ragged
men
half
mad
at
all
times
and
wholly
mad
as
far
as
the
city
and
its
machines
are
concerned
evelyn
linked
her
arm
in
his
somehow
she
told
him
smiling
i
think
one
thomas
reames
is
working
out
ways
and
means
to
help
a
city
named
yugna
not
yet
said
tommy
grimly
we
have
to
think
of
earth
not
everybody
in
the
council
approved
of
us
aten
told
me
one
chap
argued
that
we
ought
to
be
shoved
out
into
the
jungle
again
as
compatriots
of
jacaro
and
the
machines
were
especially
because
of
a
diversion
of
labor
to
get
ready
something
monstrous
and
really
deadly
to
send
down
the
tube
to
earth
we
got
to
find
out
what
that
is
and
stop
it
but
on
the
second
day
afterward
when
he
and
evelyn
were
summoned
before
the
council
again
he
still
had
not
found
out
during
those
two
days
he
learned
many
other
things
to
be
sure
that
aten
for
instance
was
relieved
from
duty
at
the
machines
only
because
he
was
wounded
that
the
power
of
the
main
machines
came
from
a
deep
bore
which
brought
up
superheated
steam
from
the
source
of
boiling
springs
long
since
built
over
that
iron
was
a
rare
metal
and
consequently
there
was
no
dynamo
in
the
city
and
magnetism
was
practically
an
unknown
force
that
electrokinetics
was
a
laboratory
puzzle
or
had
been
when
there
was
leisure
for
research
while
the
science
of
electrostatics
had
progressed
far
past
its
state
on
earth
the
little
truncheonlike
weapons
carried
a
static
charge
measurable
only
in
hundreds
of
thousands
of
volts
which
could
be
released
in
flashes
which
were
effective
up
to
a
hundred
feet
or
more
and
he
learned
that
the
actually
spat
out
in
normal
operation
tiny
droplets
of
matter
aten
could
not
describe
clearly
but
which
seemed
to
be
radioactive
with
a
period
of
five
minutes
or
less
that
in
rahn
the
nearest
other
city
was
taken
openly
and
the
jungle
was
growing
into
the
town
with
no
one
to
hold
it
back
that
two
generations
since
there
had
been
twenty
cities
like
this
one
but
that
a
bare
dozen
still
survived
that
there
was
a
tradition
that
human
beings
had
come
upon
this
planet
from
another
world
where
other
human
beings
had
harried
them
and
that
in
that
other
world
there
were
divers
races
of
humanity
of
different
colors
whereas
in
the
world
of
the
golden
city
all
mankind
was
one
race
that
tommy
declaration
that
he
came
from
another
group
of
dimensions
had
been
debated
and
on
of
jacaro
tube
accepted
and
that
there
was
keen
argument
going
on
as
to
the
measures
to
be
taken
concerning
it
these
things
tommy
had
learned
and
he
and
evelyn
went
to
their
second
interrogation
by
the
city
council
armed
with
written
vocabularies
of
nearly
a
thousand
words
which
they
had
sorted
out
and
made
ready
for
use
but
they
were
still
ignorant
of
the
weapons
the
golden
city
might
use
against
earth
the
council
meeting
took
place
in
the
same
hall
with
its
alternating
flooring
and
the
lighting
panels
casting
a
soft
light
everywhere
this
was
a
scheduled
meeting
foreseen
and
arranged
for
the
twelve
chairs
above
the
heavy
table
were
all
occupied
from
the
first
but
tommy
realized
that
the
table
had
been
intended
to
seat
a
large
number
of
councilors
there
were
guards
stationed
formally
behind
the
chairs
there
were
spectators
auditors
of
the
deliberations
of
the
council
they
were
dressed
in
a
myriad
colors
and
they
talked
quietly
among
themselves
but
it
seemed
to
tommy
that
nowhere
had
he
seen
weariness
as
an
ingrained
expression
upon
so
many
faces
tommy
and
evelyn
were
led
to
the
foot
of
the
council
table
the
bearded
old
man
in
blue
began
the
questioning
as
keeper
of
foodstuffs
according
to
aten
he
was
a
sort
of
presiding
officer
tommy
answered
the
questions
crisply
he
had
known
what
they
would
be
and
he
had
developed
a
vocabulary
to
answer
them
he
told
them
of
earth
of
professor
denham
of
his
and
the
professor
experiments
he
outlined
the
first
experiment
with
the
catapult
and
the
result
of
it
when
the
golden
city
had
sent
the
death
mist
to
wipe
out
a
band
of
ragged
men
who
had
captured
a
citizen
and
after
him
evelyn
and
her
father
this
they
remembered
nods
went
around
the
table
tommy
told
them
of
jacaro
stressing
the
fact
that
jacaro
was
an
outlaw
a
criminal
upon
earth
he
explained
the
theft
of
the
model
tube
and
how
it
was
that
their
first
contact
with
earth
had
been
with
the
dregs
of
earth
humanity
on
behalf
of
his
countrymen
he
offered
reparation
for
all
the
damage
jacaro
and
his
men
had
done
he
proposed
a
peaceful
commerce
between
worlds
to
the
infinite
benefit
of
both
there
was
silence
until
he
finished
the
faces
before
him
were
immobile
but
a
man
in
brown
asked
dry
questions
were
there
more
races
than
one
upon
earth
were
they
of
diverse
colors
did
they
ever
war
among
themselves
at
tommy
answers
the
atmosphere
seemed
to
change
and
the
man
rose
to
speak
tommy
and
evelyn
he
conceded
caustically
had
certainly
come
from
another
world
their
own
most
ancient
legends
described
just
such
a
world
as
his
a
world
of
many
races
of
many
colors
who
fought
many
wars
among
themselves
their
ancestors
had
fled
from
such
a
world
according
to
legend
through
a
twisting
cavern
which
they
had
sealed
behind
them
the
conditions
tommy
described
had
been
the
cause
of
their
ancestors
flight
they
the
people
of
yugna
would
do
well
to
follow
the
example
of
their
forebears
strip
these
earth
folk
of
their
weapons
exile
them
to
the
jungles
destroy
the
tube
through
which
the
mist
of
many
colors
had
been
sent
all
should
be
as
in
past
ages
tommy
opened
his
mouth
to
answer
but
another
man
sprang
to
his
feet
his
face
alone
was
not
weary
and
worn
as
he
stood
up
aten
murmured
and
tommy
understood
that
this
man
used
the
drug
which
was
destroying
the
city
citizens
but
gave
a
transient
energy
to
its
victims
he
spoke
in
fiery
phrases
urging
action
which
would
be
drastic
and
certain
he
spoke
confidently
persuasively
there
was
a
rustling
among
those
who
watched
and
listened
to
the
debate
he
had
caught
at
their
imagination
evelyn
exerting
every
faculty
to
understand
saw
tommy
lips
set
grimly
what
what
is
it
she
whispered
i
i
do
understand
tommy
spoke
in
a
savage
growl
he
says
he
told
her
bitterly
that
in
one
blow
they
can
defeat
both
the
jungle
and
the
invaders
from
earth
in
past
ages
their
ancestors
were
faced
by
enemies
they
could
not
defeat
they
fled
to
this
world
now
they
are
faced
by
jungles
they
can
not
defeat
he
proposes
that
they
flee
to
our
world
the
death
mist
is
a
toy
he
reminds
them
compared
with
gases
they
know
there
is
a
gas
of
which
one
part
in
ten
hundred
million
is
fatal
in
a
hundred
of
their
days
they
can
make
and
send
through
the
tube
enough
of
it
to
kill
every
living
thing
on
earth
they
figures
on
the
earth
size
and
atmosphere
from
me
damn
and
he
reminds
them
that
that
deadly
gas
changes
of
itself
into
a
harmless
substance
he
urges
them
to
gas
earth
humanity
out
of
existence
call
upon
the
other
cities
of
this
world
and
presently
move
through
the
tube
to
earth
they
carry
their
rebuild
their
cities
and
abandon
this
planet
to
the
jungles
and
the
ragged
men
and
the
hell
of
it
is
they
can
do
it
a
sudden
approving
buzz
went
through
the
council
hall
chapter
vii
fleet
from
the
approval
of
the
citizens
of
yugna
was
not
enthusiastic
it
was
desperate
their
faces
were
weary
their
lives
were
warped
they
had
been
fighting
since
birth
against
the
encroachment
of
the
jungle
which
until
the
days
of
their
grandparents
had
been
no
menace
at
all
but
for
two
generations
these
people
had
been
foredoomed
and
they
knew
it
nearly
half
the
cities
of
their
race
were
overwhelmed
and
their
inhabitants
reduced
to
savage
hunters
in
the
victorious
jungles
now
the
people
of
yugna
saw
a
chance
to
escape
from
the
jungle
they
were
offered
rest
peace
relaxation
from
the
desperate
need
to
serve
insatiable
machines
sheer
desperation
impelled
them
in
their
situation
the
people
of
earth
would
annihilate
a
solar
system
for
relief
let
alone
the
inhabitants
of
a
single
planet
shouts
began
to
be
heard
above
the
uproar
in
the
council
hall
approving
shouts
demands
that
one
be
appointed
to
conduct
the
operation
which
was
to
give
them
a
new
planet
on
which
to
live
where
their
would
thrive
in
the
open
where
jungles
would
no
longer
press
on
them
tommy
face
went
savage
and
desperate
itself
he
clenched
and
unclenched
his
hands
struggling
among
his
meagre
supply
of
words
for
promises
of
help
from
earth
which
promises
would
tip
the
scales
for
peace
again
he
raised
his
voice
in
a
shout
for
attention
he
was
unheard
the
council
hall
was
in
an
uproar
of
desperate
approval
the
orator
stood
flushed
and
triumphant
the
council
members
looked
from
eye
to
eye
and
slowly
the
old
keeper
of
foodstuffs
placed
a
golden
box
upon
the
table
he
touched
it
in
a
certain
fashion
and
handed
it
to
the
next
man
that
second
man
touched
it
and
passed
it
to
a
third
and
that
man
a
hush
fell
instantly
tommy
understood
the
measure
was
being
decided
by
solemn
vote
the
voting
device
had
reached
the
fifth
man
when
there
was
a
frantic
clatter
of
footsteps
a
door
burst
in
and
babbling
men
stood
in
the
opening
and
stammering
and
overwhelmed
but
trying
to
make
a
report
consternation
reigned
incredulous
amazed
consternation
the
bearded
old
man
rose
dazedly
and
strode
from
the
hall
with
the
rest
of
the
council
following
him
a
pause
of
stunned
stupefaction
and
the
spectators
in
the
hall
rushed
for
other
doors
stick
to
aten
snapped
tommy
something
broken
and
it
has
to
be
our
way
let
see
what
it
is
he
clung
alike
to
evelyn
and
to
aten
as
the
fought
to
clear
a
way
the
doors
were
jammed
it
was
minutes
before
they
could
make
their
way
through
and
plunge
up
the
interminable
steps
aten
mounted
only
to
fling
himself
out
to
the
open
air
then
they
were
upon
a
flying
bridge
between
two
of
the
towers
of
the
city
all
about
the
city
human
figures
were
massing
staring
upward
and
above
the
city
swirled
a
swarm
of
aircraft
tommy
counted
three
of
the
clumsy
ornithopters
high
and
motelike
there
were
twenty
or
thirty
of
the
small
craft
there
were
a
dozen
or
more
planes
and
there
were
at
least
forty
giant
ships
which
looked
as
if
they
had
been
made
for
carrying
freight
they
soared
and
circled
above
the
city
in
soundless
confusion
before
each
of
them
glittered
something
silvery
like
glass
which
was
not
a
screw
propeller
but
somehow
drew
them
on
the
council
was
massed
two
hundred
yards
away
a
dived
downward
soared
and
circled
noiselessly
fifty
yards
overhead
and
its
pilot
shouted
a
message
then
he
climbed
swiftly
and
rejoined
his
fellows
the
men
about
tommy
looked
stunned
as
if
they
could
not
believe
their
ears
aten
seemed
stricken
beyond
the
passability
of
reaction
i
got
part
of
it
snapped
tommy
to
evelyn
whispered
question
i
think
i
know
the
rest
aten
he
snapped
question
after
question
in
his
inadequate
phrasing
of
the
city
tongue
evelyn
saw
aten
answer
dully
then
bitterly
and
then
as
tommy
caught
his
arm
and
whispered
savagely
to
him
aten
eyes
caught
fire
he
nodded
violently
and
turned
on
his
heel
come
on
and
tommy
seized
evelyn
arm
again
they
followed
closely
as
aten
wormed
his
way
through
the
crowd
they
raced
behind
him
downstairs
and
through
a
door
into
a
dusty
and
unvisited
room
it
was
a
museum
aten
pointed
grimly
here
were
the
automatic
pistols
taken
from
those
of
jacaro
men
who
had
been
killed
a
nasty
gun
which
had
been
tommy
and
grenades
jacaro
tommy
checked
shell
calibres
and
carried
off
a
magazine
full
of
explosive
bullets
and
a
repeating
rifle
i
can
do
more
accurate
work
with
this
than
the
machine
gun
he
said
cryptically
let
go
it
was
not
until
they
were
racing
away
from
the
council
building
in
one
of
the
vehicles
that
evelyn
spoke
again
i
understand
part
she
said
unsteadily
those
planes
overhead
are
from
rahn
and
they
threatening
blackmail
said
tommy
between
clenched
teeth
it
sounds
like
a
perfectly
normal
earth
racket
a
fleet
from
rahn
is
over
yugna
loaded
with
the
death
mist
yugna
pays
food
and
goods
and
women
or
it
wiped
out
by
gas
further
it
surrenders
its
aircraft
to
make
further
collections
easier
rahn
refuses
to
die
though
it
let
in
the
jungle
it
turned
pirate
stronghold
fed
and
clothed
by
a
few
other
cities
like
this
one
it
should
be
able
to
hold
out
it
a
racket
evelyn
a
a
hijacking
of
a
civilised
city
sounds
like
jacaro
the
little
vehicle
darted
madly
through
empty
highways
passing
groups
of
men
staring
dazedly
upward
at
the
soaring
motes
overhead
it
darted
down
this
inclined
way
up
that
one
it
shot
into
a
building
and
around
a
winding
ramp
it
stopped
with
a
jerk
and
aten
was
climbing
out
he
ran
through
a
doorway
tommy
and
evelyn
following
planes
of
all
sizes
still
and
lifeless
filled
a
vast
hall
and
aten
struggled
with
a
door
mechanism
and
a
monster
valve
swung
wide
then
tommy
threw
his
weight
with
aten
to
roll
out
the
plane
he
had
selected
it
was
a
small
triangular
ship
with
seats
for
three
but
it
was
heavy
the
two
men
moved
it
with
desperate
exertion
aten
pointed
panting
to
and
it
took
them
five
minutes
to
get
the
plane
about
that
rail
and
engage
a
curious
contrivance
in
a
slot
in
the
fuselage
tommy
said
evelyn
you
not
going
to
run
away
hardly
said
tommy
we
going
up
i
going
to
fight
the
fleet
with
bullets
they
do
have
here
and
aten
will
know
the
range
of
their
outfits
i
coming
too
said
evelyn
desperately
tommy
hesitated
then
agreed
if
we
fail
they
gas
the
city
anyway
one
way
or
the
other
there
was
a
sudden
rumble
as
evelyn
took
her
place
the
plane
shot
forward
with
a
swift
smooth
acceleration
there
was
no
sound
of
any
motor
there
was
no
movement
of
the
glittering
thing
at
the
forepart
of
the
plane
but
the
ship
reached
the
end
of
the
slide
and
lifted
and
then
was
in
fifty
feet
above
the
vehicular
way
a
hundred
feet
above
the
ground
tommy
spoke
urgently
aten
nodded
the
ship
had
started
to
climb
he
leveled
it
out
and
darted
straight
forward
he
swung
madly
to
dodge
a
soaring
tower
he
swept
upward
a
little
to
avoid
a
flying
bridge
the
ship
was
travelling
with
an
enormous
speed
and
the
golden
walls
of
the
city
flashed
past
below
them
and
they
sped
away
across
feathery
jungle
if
we
climbed
at
once
observed
tommy
shortly
they
think
we
meant
to
fight
they
might
start
their
gassing
as
it
is
we
look
like
we
running
away
evelyn
said
nothing
for
five
miles
the
plane
fled
as
if
in
panic
evelyn
clung
to
the
filigree
side
of
the
cockpit
the
city
dwindled
behind
them
then
aten
climbed
steeply
tommy
was
looking
keenly
at
the
glittering
thing
which
propelled
the
ship
it
seemed
like
a
crystal
gridwork
like
angular
lace
contrived
of
glass
but
a
cold
blue
flame
burned
in
it
and
tommy
was
obscurely
reminded
of
a
neon
tube
though
the
color
was
wholly
unlike
a
blast
of
air
poured
back
through
the
grid
somehow
by
some
development
of
the
static
jet
which
is
merely
a
toy
in
earth
laboratories
had
become
usable
as
a
means
of
propelling
aircraft
back
they
swept
toward
the
golden
city
five
thousand
feet
or
more
aloft
the
ground
was
partly
obscured
by
the
hazy
humid
atmosphere
but
glinting
from
the
city
guided
them
soaring
things
took
shape
before
them
and
grew
swiftly
nearer
tommy
spoke
again
busily
loading
the
automatic
rifle
with
explosive
shells
aten
swung
to
follow
a
vast
dark
shape
in
its
circular
soaring
a
hundred
feet
above
it
and
a
hundred
yards
behind
wind
whistled
rising
to
a
shriek
tommy
fired
painstakingly
the
other
plane
zoomed
suddenly
as
a
flash
of
blue
flame
spouted
before
it
it
dived
then
fluttering
and
swooping
began
to
drift
helplessly
toward
the
spires
of
the
city
below
it
good
snapped
tommy
another
one
aten
aten
made
no
reply
he
flung
his
ship
sidewise
and
dived
steeply
before
a
monstrous
freight
carrier
tommy
fired
deliberately
as
they
swept
past
the
propelling
grid
flashed
blue
flame
in
a
vast
crashing
flame
it
too
began
to
flutter
down
tommy
did
not
miss
until
the
fifth
time
and
aten
turned
with
a
grimace
of
disappointment
tommy
second
shot
burst
in
a
freight
compartment
and
a
man
screamed
his
voice
carried
horribly
in
the
silence
of
these
heights
but
tommy
shot
again
and
again
and
there
was
a
satisfying
blue
flash
as
a
fifth
big
ship
went
fluttering
helplessly
down
aten
began
to
circle
for
height
tommy
refilled
the
magazine
i
bringing
down
he
explained
unnecessarily
to
evelyn
by
smashing
their
propellers
they
have
to
land
and
when
they
land
they
hostages
i
hope
confusion
became
apparent
among
the
hostile
planes
the
one
yugna
ship
was
identified
as
the
source
of
disaster
tommy
worked
his
rifle
in
cold
fury
he
aimed
at
no
man
but
the
propelling
grids
were
large
for
a
ship
they
were
five
feet
in
diameter
and
for
the
big
freight
ships
they
were
circles
fifteen
feet
across
they
were
perfect
targets
and
aten
seemed
to
grasp
the
necessary
tactics
almost
instantly
dead
ahead
or
from
straight
astern
tommy
could
not
miss
a
shot
the
fleet
of
rahn
went
fluttering
downward
fifteen
of
the
biggest
were
down
and
six
of
the
planes
a
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
flashed
at
their
bows
and
drifted
helplessly
then
the
ships
attacked
six
of
them
at
once
aten
grinned
and
dived
for
all
of
them
one
by
one
tommy
smashed
their
crystal
grids
and
watched
them
sinking
unsteadily
toward
the
towers
of
the
city
as
his
own
ship
drove
over
them
little
golden
flashes
licked
out
weapons
one
flash
struck
the
wingtip
of
their
plane
and
flame
burst
out
but
aten
flung
the
ship
into
a
mad
whirl
in
which
the
blaze
was
blown
out
another
freight
ship
helpless
and
another
then
the
air
fleet
of
rahn
turned
and
fled
the
ornithopters
winged
away
in
heavy
creaking
terror
the
others
dived
for
speed
and
flattened
out
hardly
above
the
jungle
they
streaked
away
in
ignominious
panic
aten
darted
and
circled
above
them
and
as
tommy
failed
to
fire
turned
and
went
racing
back
toward
the
city
after
the
first
ones
went
down
observed
tommy
they
knew
that
if
they
gassed
the
city
we
shoot
them
down
into
their
own
gas
cloud
so
they
ran
away
i
hope
this
gives
us
a
pull
the
city
towers
loomed
before
them
the
lacy
bridges
swarmed
with
human
figures
somewhere
a
fight
was
in
progress
about
a
grounded
plane
from
rahn
others
seemed
to
have
surrendered
sullenly
on
alighting
for
the
first
time
tommy
saw
the
city
as
a
thronging
mass
of
humanity
and
for
the
first
time
he
realized
how
terrible
must
be
the
strain
upon
the
city
if
with
so
large
a
population
so
few
could
be
free
for
leisure
in
normal
times
the
little
plane
settled
down
and
landed
lightly
there
were
a
dozen
men
on
the
landing
platform
now
and
they
were
herding
disarmed
men
from
rahn
away
from
a
big
ship
tommy
had
brought
down
tommy
looked
curiously
at
the
prisoners
they
seemed
freer
than
the
inhabitants
of
yugna
their
faces
showed
no
such
signs
of
strain
but
they
did
not
seem
nor
did
they
appear
as
capable
or
as
resolute
said
aten
in
an
explanatory
tone
seeing
expression
he
put
his
shoulder
to
the
big
ship
to
wheel
it
back
into
its
shed
you
son
of
a
gun
grunted
tommy
it
all
in
the
day
work
to
you
fighting
an
invading
fleet
a
messenger
came
panting
through
the
doorway
tommy
grinned
the
council
wants
us
evelyn
now
maybe
they
listen
the
atmosphere
of
the
resumed
council
meeting
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
considerably
changed
the
keeper
of
foodstuffs
thanked
them
with
dignity
he
invited
tommy
to
offer
advice
since
his
services
had
proved
so
useful
advice
said
tommy
in
the
halting
fumbling
phrases
he
had
slaved
to
acquire
i
would
put
the
prisoners
from
rahn
to
work
at
the
machines
releasing
citizens
there
was
a
buzz
of
approval
and
he
added
drily
in
english
i
playing
politics
evelyn
again
in
the
speech
of
yugna
he
added
and
i
would
have
the
fleet
of
yugna
soar
above
rahn
not
to
demand
tribute
as
that
city
did
but
to
disable
all
its
aircraft
so
that
such
piracy
as
may
not
be
tried
again
there
was
a
second
buzz
of
approval
and
third
said
tommy
earnestly
i
would
communicate
with
earth
rather
than
assassinate
it
i
would
require
the
science
of
earth
for
the
benefit
of
this
world
rather
than
use
the
science
of
this
world
to
annihilate
that
i
for
the
second
time
the
council
meeting
was
interrupted
an
armed
messenger
came
pounding
into
the
room
he
reported
swiftly
tommy
grasped
evelyn
wrist
in
what
was
almost
a
painful
grip
noises
in
the
tube
he
told
her
sharply
doing
something
in
the
tube
jacaro
came
through
your
father
there
was
an
alert
silence
in
the
council
hall
the
old
man
had
listened
to
the
messenger
now
he
asked
a
grim
question
of
tommy
they
may
be
my
friends
or
your
enemies
said
tommy
briefly
mass
and
let
me
find
out
it
was
the
only
possible
thing
to
do
tommy
and
evelyn
went
with
the
council
in
a
body
in
a
huge
wheeled
vehicle
that
raced
across
the
city
lingering
groups
still
searched
the
sky
above
them
now
blessedly
empty
again
but
the
council
vehicle
dived
down
and
down
to
ground
level
where
the
rumble
of
machines
was
loud
indeed
and
then
turned
into
a
tunnel
which
went
down
still
farther
there
was
feverish
activity
ahead
where
it
stopped
and
a
golden
came
into
sight
upon
a
truck
questions
feverish
replies
the
man
touched
tommy
on
the
shoulder
regarding
him
with
a
peculiarly
noncommittal
gaze
and
pointed
to
a
doorway
that
someone
was
just
opening
the
door
swung
wide
there
was
a
confusion
of
mist
within
it
and
tommy
noticed
that
tanks
upon
tanks
were
massed
outside
the
metal
wall
of
that
compartment
and
seemingly
had
been
pouring
something
into
the
room
the
mist
drew
back
from
the
door
lighting
panels
appeared
dimly
then
grew
distinct
there
were
small
collapsed
bundles
of
fur
upon
the
floor
of
the
storeroom
being
exposed
to
view
they
were
probably
the
equivalent
of
rats
and
then
the
last
remnant
of
mist
vanished
with
a
curiously
wraithlike
abruptness
and
the
end
of
jacaro
tube
came
into
view
tommy
advanced
evelyn
clinging
to
his
sleeve
there
were
clanking
noises
audible
in
this
room
even
above
the
dull
rumble
of
the
machines
the
noises
came
from
the
tube
mouth
it
was
four
feet
and
more
across
and
it
projected
at
a
crazy
angle
out
of
a
previously
solid
wall
hello
shouted
tommy
down
the
tube
the
clattering
noise
stopped
then
continued
at
a
faster
rate
the
gas
is
cut
off
shouted
tommy
again
who
there
a
voice
gasped
from
the
tube
depths
it
him
the
tone
was
made
metallic
by
echoing
and
reechoing
in
the
bends
of
the
tube
but
it
was
smithers
we
comin
mr
reames
is
is
daddy
there
called
evelyn
eagerly
daddy
coming
said
a
grim
voice
the
clattering
grew
nearer
a
goggled
head
appeared
and
a
body
followed
it
out
of
the
tube
laden
with
a
multitude
of
burdens
a
second
climbed
still
more
heavily
after
the
first
the
citizens
of
the
golden
city
reached
quietly
to
the
weapons
at
their
waists
a
third
voice
came
up
the
tube
distant
and
nearly
unintelligible
it
roared
a
question
smithers
ripped
off
his
gas
mask
and
said
distinctly
sure
we
through
go
ahead
an
go
to
hell
then
there
was
a
thunderous
detonation
somewhere
down
in
the
depths
the
visible
part
of
it
jerked
spasmodically
and
cracked
across
a
wisp
of
brownish
smoke
puffed
out
of
it
and
the
stinging
reek
of
high
explosive
tainted
the
air
then
evelyn
was
clinging
close
to
her
father
and
he
was
patting
her
comfortingly
and
smithers
was
pumping
both
of
tommy
hands
his
normal
calmness
torn
from
him
for
once
but
after
a
bare
moment
he
had
gripped
himself
again
he
unloaded
an
impressive
number
of
parcels
from
about
his
person
then
he
regarded
the
citizens
of
the
golden
city
with
an
impersonal
estimating
gaze
ignoring
twenty
weapons
trained
upon
him
those
damn
fools
back
on
earth
he
observed
impassively
decided
the
professor
an
me
was
better
off
of
it
so
they
let
us
come
through
the
tube
before
they
blew
it
up
we
brought
the
explosive
bullets
reames
i
hope
we
brought
enough
and
tommy
grinned
elatedly
as
denham
turned
to
crush
his
hands
in
his
own
chapter
viii
devils
have
got
evelyn
that
night
the
three
of
them
talked
on
a
high
terrace
with
most
of
the
golden
city
spread
out
below
them
over
their
heads
lights
of
many
colors
moved
and
shifted
slowly
in
the
sky
there
were
a
myriad
glowing
specks
of
about
the
ways
of
the
city
and
the
air
was
full
of
fragrant
odors
the
breath
of
the
jungle
reached
them
even
a
thousand
feet
above
ground
and
the
dull
persistent
roar
of
the
machines
reached
them
too
there
were
five
people
on
the
terrace
tommy
denham
smithers
aten
and
the
old
keeper
of
foodstuffs
he
looked
on
as
the
earthmen
talked
we
marooned
tommy
was
saying
crisply
and
for
the
time
being
we
got
to
throw
in
with
these
people
i
believe
they
came
from
earth
originally
four
five
thousand
years
ago
perhaps
their
tale
is
of
a
cave
they
sealed
up
behind
them
it
might
have
been
a
primitive
tube
if
such
a
thing
can
be
imagined
denham
filled
his
pipe
and
lighted
it
meditatively
half
the
american
indian
tribes
he
observed
drily
had
legends
of
coming
originally
from
an
underworld
i
wonder
if
tubes
are
less
your
own
invention
than
we
thought
tommy
shrugged
in
any
case
earth
is
safe
is
it
insisted
denham
you
say
they
understood
at
once
when
you
talked
of
ask
the
old
chap
there
tommy
frowned
then
labored
with
the
question
the
bearded
old
man
spoke
gravely
at
his
answer
tommy
grimaced
datl
gone
looking
for
the
cave
their
legends
tell
of
he
said
reluctantly
he
the
lad
who
wanted
the
city
to
gas
earth
with
some
ghastly
stuff
they
know
of
and
move
over
when
the
gas
was
harmless
again
but
the
cave
has
been
lost
for
centuries
and
it
in
the
torrid
zone
which
torrid
we
near
the
north
pole
of
this
planet
and
it
tropic
here
it
must
be
mighty
hot
at
the
equator
datl
took
a
ship
and
supplies
and
sailed
off
he
may
be
killed
in
any
case
it
be
some
time
before
he
dangerous
meanwhile
as
i
said
we
marooned
and
more
said
denham
deliberately
by
the
time
the
authorities
halfway
believed
me
and
von
holtz
could
talk
there
were
more
deaths
from
the
death
mist
it
wiped
out
a
village
clean
so
when
it
was
realized
that
i
caused
it
or
that
was
their
interpretation
and
was
the
only
man
who
could
cause
it
again
why
the
authorities
thought
it
a
splendid
idea
for
me
to
come
through
the
tube
they
invited
me
to
commit
suicide
my
knowledge
was
too
dangerous
for
a
man
to
have
so
he
added
grimly
i
have
committed
suicide
we
will
not
be
welcomed
back
on
earth
tommy
tommy
made
an
impatient
gesture
worry
about
that
later
he
said
impatiently
right
now
there
a
war
on
rahn
desperate
and
the
prisoners
we
took
this
morning
say
jacaro
and
his
gunmen
are
there
advising
them
ragged
men
have
joined
in
to
help
kill
civilized
humans
and
they
still
got
aircraft
which
can
still
bombard
this
city
observed
denham
ca
they
tommy
pointed
to
the
beams
of
light
playing
through
the
sky
overhead
no
those
lights
were
invented
to
guide
planes
back
home
they
static
lights
cold
lights
by
the
way
and
they
register
powerfully
when
a
propeller
comes
within
range
of
them
if
rahn
tries
a
night
attack
aten
and
i
take
off
and
shoot
them
down
again
that
that
but
we
got
to
design
gas
masks
for
these
people
and
i
think
i
can
persuade
the
council
to
send
over
and
take
all
rahn
aircraft
away
but
the
real
emergency
is
the
jungle
he
expounded
the
situation
of
the
city
as
he
understood
it
he
labored
painstakingly
to
make
his
meaning
clear
while
denham
blew
meditative
smoke
rings
and
smithers
listened
quietly
but
when
tommy
had
finished
smithers
said
in
a
vast
calm
say
reames
i
asked
you
to
get
somebody
to
take
me
through
some
o
these
engine
rooms
that
kinda
my
specialty
these
folks
are
good
no
question
there
engines
even
steam
engines
we
could
build
on
earth
but
my
gawd
they
dumb
there
ai
a
piece
of
automatic
machinery
on
the
place
there
one
man
to
every
motor
handlin
the
controls
or
the
throttle
they
got
stuff
we
could
come
near
but
they
never
thought
of
a
steam
governor
tommy
turned
kindling
eyes
upon
him
go
on
hell
said
smithers
gim
me
some
tools
an
i
go
through
one
shop
an
cut
the
workin
force
in
half
just
slammin
governors
valves
an
automatic
on
the
machines
i
understand
tommy
jumped
to
his
feet
he
paced
up
and
down
then
halted
and
began
to
spout
at
aten
and
the
keeper
of
foodstuffs
he
gesticulated
fumbling
for
words
and
hunted
absurdly
for
the
ones
he
wanted
among
his
written
lists
and
finally
was
drawing
excitedly
on
tablet
smithers
got
up
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
that
ai
it
reames
he
said
slowly
maybe
i
tommy
pressed
the
stud
that
erased
the
page
smithers
took
the
tablet
and
began
to
draw
painstakingly
aten
watching
exclaimed
suddenly
smithers
was
drawing
an
actual
machine
actually
used
in
the
golden
city
and
he
was
making
a
working
sketch
of
a
governor
so
that
it
would
operate
without
supervision
while
the
steam
pressure
continued
aten
began
to
talk
excitedly
the
keeper
of
foodstuffs
took
the
tablet
and
examined
it
he
looked
blank
then
amazed
and
as
the
utterly
foreign
idea
of
a
machine
which
controlled
itself
struck
home
his
hands
shook
and
color
deepened
in
his
cheeks
he
gave
an
order
to
aten
who
dashed
away
in
ten
minutes
other
men
began
to
arrive
they
bent
over
the
drawing
excited
comments
discussions
and
disputes
began
a
dawning
enthusiasm
manifested
itself
two
of
them
approached
smithers
respectfully
with
shining
eyes
they
drew
their
tablets
from
their
belts
rather
skilfully
drew
the
governor
he
had
indicated
in
larger
scale
and
by
gestures
asked
for
more
detailed
plans
smithers
stood
up
to
go
with
them
you
a
hero
now
smithers
tommy
informed
him
exultantly
they
work
you
to
death
and
call
you
blessed
yes
sir
said
smithers
these
fellas
are
right
good
mechanics
they
just
happened
to
miss
this
trick
he
paused
uh
where
miss
evelyn
with
aten
wife
said
tommy
this
was
no
time
to
discuss
the
marital
system
of
yugna
we
were
prisoners
until
this
morning
now
we
guests
of
honor
evelyn
talking
to
a
lot
of
women
and
trying
to
boost
our
prestige
smithers
went
over
to
the
gesticulating
group
of
draftsmen
he
settled
down
to
explain
by
drawings
since
he
had
not
a
word
of
their
language
in
a
few
minutes
a
group
went
rushing
away
with
the
sketch
tablets
held
jealously
to
their
breasts
bound
for
workshops
other
men
appeared
to
present
new
problems
a
wave
of
sheer
enthusiasm
was
in
being
a
new
idea
which
would
lessen
the
demands
of
the
machines
was
a
godsend
to
these
folk
then
denham
blew
a
smoke
ring
and
said
meditatively
i
think
i
got
something
too
tommy
vibrations
sound
waves
at
two
to
three
hundred
thousand
per
second
air
wo
carry
them
liquids
will
they
use
to
sterilize
milk
killing
the
germs
by
sound
waves
carried
through
the
fluid
i
think
we
can
start
some
generators
out
there
that
will
go
through
the
wet
soil
and
kill
all
vegetation
within
a
given
range
we
might
clear
away
the
jungle
for
half
a
mile
or
so
and
then
use
beams
to
help
it
clear
while
new
are
tried
out
tommy
eyes
glowed
you
given
yourself
a
job
we
turn
this
planet
upside
down
we
have
to
said
denham
drily
this
city
may
believe
in
you
but
there
are
others
and
these
folk
are
a
little
too
clever
there
no
reason
why
some
other
city
should
attack
earth
if
they
seriously
attack
the
problem
of
building
a
tube
tommy
ground
his
teeth
frowning
then
he
started
up
there
was
a
new
noise
down
in
the
city
a
sudden
flare
of
intolerable
illumination
broke
out
there
was
an
explosion
many
screams
then
the
yelling
tumult
of
men
in
deadly
battle
every
man
on
the
tower
terrace
was
facing
toward
the
noise
staring
the
man
gave
an
order
deliberately
men
rushed
but
as
they
swarmed
toward
an
exit
a
green
beam
of
light
appeared
near
the
uproar
it
streaked
upward
wavering
from
side
to
side
and
making
the
golden
walls
visible
in
a
ghostly
fashion
it
shivered
in
a
hasty
rhythm
aten
groaned
almost
sobbed
there
was
another
flash
of
that
unbearable
actinic
flame
a
was
in
action
then
a
third
flash
this
was
farther
away
the
tumult
died
suddenly
but
the
green
continued
its
motion
tommy
was
snapping
questions
aten
spoke
and
choked
upon
his
words
tommy
swore
in
a
sudden
raging
passion
and
then
turned
a
chalky
face
toward
the
other
two
men
from
earth
the
prisoners
he
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
the
men
from
rahn
they
broke
loose
they
rushed
an
arsenal
with
hand
weapons
and
a
they
fought
their
way
to
a
place
where
the
big
vehicles
are
kept
they
raided
a
on
the
way
and
seized
women
they
gone
off
on
the
metal
roads
through
the
jungle
he
tried
to
ease
his
collar
aten
still
watching
the
green
beam
croaked
another
sentence
those
devils
have
got
evelyn
cried
tommy
hoarsely
my
god
aten
wife
and
his
he
jerked
a
hand
toward
the
councilor
fifty
women
gone
through
the
jungle
with
them
toward
rahn
those
devils
have
got
evelyn
he
whirled
upon
aten
seizing
his
shoulder
shaking
the
man
as
he
roared
questions
no
chance
of
catching
them
far
away
in
the
jungle
the
infinitely
vivid
actinic
flame
blazed
for
several
seconds
they
sprayed
thermit
on
the
road
it
melted
and
ruined
it
take
hours
to
haul
the
ground
vehicles
past
the
gap
they
got
arms
and
lights
they
can
fight
off
the
beasts
and
ragged
men
they
make
rahn
and
then
he
shook
with
the
rage
that
possessed
him
jacaro
there
with
those
gunmen
of
his
and
his
friends
the
ragged
men
he
seemed
to
control
himself
with
a
terrific
effort
he
turned
to
the
councilor
whose
bearing
was
that
of
a
man
stunned
by
disaster
tommy
spoke
measuredly
choosing
words
with
a
painstaking
care
clipping
the
words
crisply
as
he
spoke
the
councilor
stiffened
old
as
he
was
an
undeniable
fighting
light
came
into
his
eyes
he
barked
orders
right
and
left
men
woke
from
the
paralysis
of
shock
and
fled
upon
errands
of
his
command
and
tommy
turned
to
denham
and
smithers
the
women
will
be
safe
until
dawn
he
said
evenly
our
late
prisoners
ca
lose
the
way
aluminum
roads
that
are
no
longer
much
used
lead
between
all
the
cities
but
they
wo
dare
stop
in
the
jungles
they
go
straight
on
through
they
should
reach
rahn
at
dawn
or
a
little
before
and
at
dawn
our
air
fleet
will
be
over
the
city
and
they
give
back
the
women
unharmed
or
we
turn
their
own
trick
on
them
by
god
it
be
better
for
evelyn
to
die
of
gas
than
as
as
the
ragged
men
would
kill
her
his
hands
were
clenched
and
he
breathed
noisily
for
an
instant
then
he
swallowed
and
went
on
in
the
same
unnatural
calm
smithers
you
going
to
stay
behind
with
part
of
the
air
fleet
you
get
aloft
before
dawn
and
shoot
down
any
strange
aircraft
they
might
try
to
stalemate
us
by
repeating
their
threat
with
our
guns
over
rahn
i
give
orders
he
turned
again
to
the
councilor
who
nodded
glanced
at
smithers
and
repeated
the
command
you
sir
he
spoke
to
denham
you
come
with
me
it
your
right
i
suppose
and
we
go
down
and
get
ready
he
led
the
way
steadily
toward
a
door
but
he
reached
up
to
his
collar
once
as
if
he
were
choking
and
ripped
away
collar
and
coat
and
all
unconscious
of
the
resistance
of
the
cloth
that
night
the
golden
city
made
savage
preparation
for
war
ships
were
loaded
and
ranged
in
order
crews
armed
themselves
and
helped
in
the
loading
and
arming
of
other
ships
oddly
enough
it
was
to
tommy
that
men
came
to
ask
if
the
directing
apparatus
for
the
death
mist
should
be
carried
the
death
mist
could
of
course
be
used
as
a
gas
alone
drifting
with
the
wind
or
it
could
be
directed
from
a
distance
this
had
been
done
on
earth
with
the
directional
impulses
sent
blindly
down
the
tube
merely
to
keep
the
mist
moving
always
the
controlling
apparatus
could
be
carried
in
a
monster
freight
plane
tommy
ordered
it
done
also
he
had
the
captured
planes
from
rahn
refitted
for
flight
by
replacing
their
smashed
propelling
grids
fresh
crews
of
men
for
these
ships
organized
themselves
when
the
fleet
took
off
there
was
only
darkness
in
all
the
world
the
unfamiliar
stars
above
shone
bright
and
very
near
as
tommy
ship
leading
winged
noiselessly
up
and
down
and
straight
away
from
the
play
of
prismatic
lights
above
the
city
behind
him
silhouetted
against
that
glow
were
the
angular
shapes
of
many
other
noiseless
shadows
the
ornithopters
with
their
racket
would
start
later
so
the
planes
would
be
soaring
above
rahn
before
their
presence
was
even
suspected
the
rest
of
the
fleet
flew
in
darkness
the
flight
above
the
jungle
would
have
been
at
another
time
there
were
the
stars
above
nearer
and
brighter
than
those
of
earth
there
was
no
milky
way
in
the
firmament
of
this
universe
the
stars
were
separate
and
fewer
in
number
there
was
no
moon
and
below
there
was
only
utter
unrelieved
darkness
from
which
now
and
again
arose
they
were
clearly
audible
on
board
the
silent
air
fleet
roarings
bellowings
and
hoarse
screamings
once
the
ships
passed
above
a
tumult
as
of
unthinkable
monsters
in
deadly
battle
when
for
an
instant
the
very
clashing
of
monstrous
jaws
was
audible
and
a
hissing
sound
which
seemed
filled
with
deadly
hate
then
lights
few
of
them
and
dim
ones
then
blazing
fires
ragged
men
camped
without
the
walls
of
rahn
or
in
some
courtyard
where
the
jungle
thrust
greedy
invading
green
tentacles
the
air
fleet
circled
noiselessly
in
a
huge
batlike
cloud
then
things
came
racing
from
the
darkness
down
below
and
there
was
a
tumult
and
a
shouting
and
presently
the
hilarious
insanely
gleeful
uproar
of
the
ragged
men
tommy
face
went
gray
these
were
the
escaped
prisoners
arrived
actually
after
the
air
fleet
which
was
to
demand
the
return
of
their
captives
tommy
wet
his
lips
and
spoke
grimly
to
his
pilot
there
were
six
men
and
many
bombs
in
his
ship
he
was
asking
if
communication
could
be
had
with
the
other
ships
it
was
wise
to
let
rahn
know
at
once
that
avengers
lurked
overhead
for
the
captives
just
delivered
there
for
answer
a
green
shot
out
it
wavered
here
and
there
tommy
commanded
again
and
as
the
flickered
he
somehow
sensed
the
obedience
of
the
invisible
ships
about
him
they
were
sweeping
off
to
right
and
left
bombs
of
the
death
mist
were
dropping
in
the
darkness
even
in
the
starlight
tommy
could
see
great
walls
of
pale
vapor
building
themselves
up
above
the
jungle
and
a
sudden
confused
noise
of
yapping
defiance
and
raging
hatred
came
up
from
the
city
of
rahn
but
before
dawn
came
there
was
no
other
sign
that
their
presence
was
known
the
ornithopters
came
squeaking
and
rattling
in
their
heavy
flight
just
as
the
sun
of
this
world
peered
above
the
horizon
the
fronds
waved
languidly
in
the
morning
breeze
the
walls
and
towers
of
rahn
gleamed
bright
gold
in
parts
and
in
parts
they
seemed
dull
and
scabrous
with
some
creeping
fungus
stuff
and
on
one
side
of
the
city
the
wall
was
overwhelmed
by
a
triumphant
tide
of
green
there
the
jungle
had
crawled
over
the
ramparts
and
surged
into
the
city
three
of
the
towers
had
their
bases
in
the
welter
of
growing
things
and
creepers
had
climbed
incredibly
and
were
still
climbing
to
enter
and
then
destroy
the
structures
but
about
the
city
there
now
reared
a
new
rampart
rising
above
the
tops
there
was
a
wall
of
the
death
mist
encompassing
the
city
no
living
thing
could
enter
or
leave
the
city
without
passing
through
that
cloud
and
at
tommy
order
it
moved
forward
to
the
very
encampments
of
the
ragged
men
he
spoke
beginning
his
ultimatum
but
a
movement
below
checked
him
on
a
landing
stage
that
was
spotted
with
molds
and
lichens
women
were
being
herded
into
clear
view
they
were
the
women
of
the
golden
city
tommy
saw
a
tiny
figure
in
khaki
evelyn
then
there
was
a
sudden
uproar
from
an
encampment
of
the
ragged
men
his
eyes
flicked
there
and
he
saw
the
ragged
men
running
into
and
out
of
the
tall
wall
of
death
mist
and
they
laughed
uproariously
and
ran
into
and
out
of
the
mist
again
his
pilot
dived
down
the
ragged
men
yelled
and
capered
and
howled
derisively
at
him
he
saw
that
they
removed
masklike
things
from
their
faces
in
order
to
shout
and
donned
them
again
before
running
again
into
the
mist
at
once
he
understood
the
ragged
men
had
gas
masks
then
a
sudden
cracking
noise
three
men
had
opened
fire
with
rifles
from
below
their
garments
were
in
contrast
to
the
vivid
tints
of
the
clothing
of
the
inhabitants
of
rahn
they
were
gunmen
and
a
great
freight
carrier
from
yugna
veered
suddenly
and
a
bluish
flash
burst
out
before
it
and
it
began
to
flutter
helplessly
down
into
the
city
beneath
the
weapons
of
tommy
fleet
were
useless
since
the
citizens
of
rahn
were
protected
by
gas
masks
and
tommy
fighting
ships
were
subject
to
the
same
rifle
fire
against
their
propelling
grids
that
had
defeated
the
fleet
from
rahn
the
only
thing
the
avenging
fleet
could
now
accomplish
was
the
death
of
the
women
it
could
not
save
chapter
ix
a
huge
ornithopter
came
heavily
out
on
the
landing
stage
in
the
city
of
rahn
its
crew
took
their
places
with
a
creaking
and
rattling
noise
it
rose
toward
the
invading
fleet
from
its
filigree
cockpit
sides
men
waved
green
branches
a
green
light
wavered
from
the
big
plane
that
carried
the
bearded
council
man
and
denham
that
plane
swept
forward
and
hovered
above
the
ornithopter
the
two
flying
things
seemed
almost
fastened
together
so
closely
did
their
pilots
maintain
that
same
speed
and
course
a
snaky
rope
went
coiling
down
into
the
lower
ship
cockpit
a
burly
figure
began
to
climb
it
hand
over
hand
a
second
figure
followed
a
third
figure
in
the
drab
clothing
that
distinguished
jacaro
men
from
all
others
wrapped
the
rope
about
himself
and
was
hauled
up
bodily
and
tommy
had
seen
jacaro
but
once
yet
he
was
suddenly
grimly
convinced
that
this
was
jacaro
himself
the
two
planes
swept
apart
the
ornithopter
descended
toward
the
landing
stage
of
rahn
the
freight
plane
swept
toward
the
ship
that
carried
tommy
again
the
snaky
rope
coiled
down
and
tommy
swung
up
the
fifteen
feet
that
alone
separated
the
two
soaring
planes
and
looked
into
the
hard
amused
eyes
of
jacaro
where
he
sat
between
two
other
emissaries
of
rahn
one
of
them
was
half
naked
and
savage
with
the
light
of
madness
in
his
eyes
a
ragged
man
the
other
was
lean
and
desperate
despite
the
colored
tunic
of
a
civilized
man
that
he
wore
hello
said
jacaro
blandly
we
come
up
to
talk
things
over
tommy
gave
him
the
briefest
of
nods
he
looked
at
denham
who
was
deathly
white
and
grim
and
the
bearded
councilor
i
been
givin
the
dope
said
jacaro
easily
we
got
the
whip
hand
now
we
got
gas
masks
we
got
guns
just
the
same
as
you
have
we
got

said
tommy
evenly
or
damned
little
your
men
brought
down
one
ship
and
stopped
if
you
had
enough
shells
would
you
have
stopped
there
jacaro
grinned
you
got
arithmetic
reames
he
conceded
that
so
but
i
it
again
we
got
the
women
your
girl
for
one
now

swell
time
talk
sense
said
tommy
without
even
contempt
in
his
tone
jacaro
snarled
no
sense
actin
too
big
but
the
snarl
encouraged
tommy
because
it
proved
jacaro
less
confidant
than
he
tried
to
seem
his
next
change
of
tone
proved
it
aw
hell
he
said
placatingly
this
is
what
figurin
on
these
guys
ai
used
to
fighting
but
they
got
the
stuff
they
got
gases

with

white

figure
the
we

canada
or
mexico
whichever
y
want

guy
a
coupla
months

then
tommy
expression
did
not
change
if
it
were
that
easy
he
said
drily
you
would
be
bargaining
i
not
altogether
a
fool
jacaro
we
want
those
women
back
you
want
something
we
got
and
you
want
it
badly
cut
out
the
oratory
and
tell
me
the
real
price
for
the
return
of
the
women
unharmed
jacaro
burst
into
a
flood
of
profanity
i
rather
evelyn
died
from
gas
said
tommy
than
as
your
filthy
ragged
men
would
kill
her
and
you
know
i
mean
it
he
switched
to
the
language
of
the
cities
to
go
on
coldly
if
one
woman
is
harmed
rahn
dies
we
will
shoot
down
every
ship
that
rises
from
her
stages
we
will
spray
burning
thermit
through
her
streets
we
will
cover
her
towers
with
gas
until
her
people
starve
in
the
gas
masks
made
the
lean
man
in
the
tunic
of
rahn
snarled
bitterly
what
matter
we
starve
now
tommy
turned
upon
him
as
jacaro
whirled
and
cursed
him
bitterly
for
the
revealing
outburst
we
will
ransom
the
women
with
food
said
tommy
coldly
and
then
his
eyes
flamed
and
thrash
you
afterwards
for
fools
he
made
a
gesture
to
the
keeper
of
foodstuffs
it
was
unconsciously
an
authoritative
gesture
though
the
keeper
of
foodstuffs
was
in
the
state
of
affairs
in
yugna
the
head
of
the
council
but
that
old
man
spoke
deliberately
the
man
from
rahn
snarled
his
reply
and
tommy
turned
aside
as
the
bargaining
went
on
he
could
see
evelyn
down
below
a
tiny
speck
of
khaki
amid
the
robes
of
the
other
women
this
had
been
a
savage
expedition
to
rescue
or
to
avenge
it
had
deteriorated
into
a
bargain
tommy
heard
dully
amounts
of
unfamiliar
weights
and
measures
of
foodstuffs
he
did
not
recognize
he
heard
the
time
and
place
of
payment
named
the
gate
of
yugna
the
third
dawn
hence
he
hardly
looked
up
as
at
some
signal
one
of
their
own
ornithopters
slid
below
and
the
three
ambassadors
of
rahn
prepared
to
go
over
the
side
but
jacaro
snarled
out
of
one
corner
of
his
mouth
these
guys
are
takin
each
other
words
maybe
that
all
right
but
i
warnin
you
if
there
any
he
was
gone
the
keeper
of
foodstuffs
touched
tommy
shoulder
our
flier
he
said
slowly
will
make
sure
our
women
are
as
yet
unharmed
we
are
to
deliver
the
foods
at
our
own
city
gate
and
after
the
women
have
been
returned
rahn
dares
not
keep
them
or
harm
them
we
of
yugna
keep
our
word
even
in
rahn
they
know
it
but
they
wo
keep
theirs
said
tommy
heavily
not
with
a
man
of
earth
to
lead
them
he
watched
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
as
the
ornithopter
alighted
near
the
assembled
women
of
yugna
as
the
three
ambassadors
climbed
out
he
could
hear
the
faint
murmur
of
voices
the
men
of
yugna
under
truce
called
across
the
landing
stage
to
the
women
of
their
own
city
and
the
women
replied
to
them
then
the
crew
of
the
one
grounded
freighter
arrived
on
the
landing
stage
and
the
flapping
flier
rose
slowly
and
rejoined
the
fleet
its
crew
shouted
a
shamefaced
reassurance
to
the
flagship
i
suppose
said
tommy
bitterly
we
better
go
back
if
you
sure
the
women
are
safe
i
am
sure
said
the
old
man
unhappily
or
i
had
not
agreed
to
pay
half
the
foodstuffs
in
yugna
for
their
return
he
withdrew
into
a
troubled
silence
as
the
fleet
swept
far
from
triumphantly
for
him
denham
had
not
spoken
at
all
though
his
eyes
had
blazed
savagely
upon
the
men
of
rahn
now
he
spoke
tommy
evelyn
she
is
all
right
so
far
said
tommy
bitterly
she
to
be
ransomed
by
foodstuffs
paid
at
the
gates
of
yugna
and
jacaro
bragged
running
rahn
and
they
got
gas
masks
we
better
be
ready
for
trouble
after
the
women
are
returned
denham
nodded
grimly
tommy
reached
out
and
took
one
of
the
black
tablets
from
the
man
beside
him
he
began
to
draw
carefully
his
eyes
savage
what
that
there
steam
in
yugna
said
tommy
coldly
designing
steam
guns
gravity
feed
of
spherical
projectiles
a
jet
of
steam
instead
of
gunpowder
they
be
but
we
can
use
balls
for
shock
effect
and
with
long
barrels
they
ought
to
serve
for
a
hundred
yards
or
better
smooth
bore
of
course
denham
stirred
his
lips
were
pinched
i
design
a
gas
mask
he
said
restlessly
and
smithers
and
i
between
us
will
do
what
we
can
the
air
fleet
went
on
over
the
waving
jungle
in
an
unvarying
monotony
of
bitterness
presently
tommy
wearily
explained
his
design
to
the
bearded
councilor
who
with
the
quick
comprehension
of
mechanical
design
apparently
instinctive
in
these
folk
grasped
it
immediately
he
selected
three
of
the
crew
and
passed
drawings
to
them
while
the
jungle
flowed
beneath
the
fleet
they
studied
the
sketches
made
other
drawings
and
showed
them
eagerly
to
tommy
when
the
fleet
soared
down
to
the
scattered
landing
stages
not
only
was
the
design
understood
but
apparently
plans
for
production
had
been
made
it
did
not
take
the
men
of
the
golden
city
long
to
respond
tommy
flung
himself
savagely
into
the
work
he
had
taken
upon
himself
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
ask
for
authority
he
knew
what
had
to
be
done
and
he
set
to
work
to
do
it
commanding
men
and
materials
as
if
there
could
be
no
question
of
disobedience
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
yielded
impatiently
to
an
order
of
the
council
that
he
should
present
himself
in
the
council
hall
and
since
no
questions
were
asked
him
continued
his
organizing
in
the
very
presence
of
the
council
sending
for
information
and
giving
orders
in
a
low
tone
while
the
council
deliberated
a
vote
was
taken
by
the
voting
machine
at
its
end
he
was
solemnly
informed
that
though
not
a
native
of
yugna
he
was
entrusted
with
the
command
of
the
defense
forces
of
the
city
his
skill
in
arms
as
evidenced
by
his
defeat
of
the
fleet
of
rahn
and
his
ability
in
command
when
he
met
the
defense
of
rahn
with
a
threat
of
starvation
moved
the
council
to
that
action
he
accepted
the
command
almost
abstractedly
and
hurried
away
to
pick
gun
emplacements
within
four
hours
after
the
return
of
the
fleet
the
first
steam
gun
was
ready
for
trial
smithers
appeared
and
vastly
calm
to
announce
that
others
could
be
turned
out
in
quantity
these
guys
have
got
the
stuff
he
said
steadily
instead
o
their
stuff
they
shoot
it
on
a
core
in
a
melted
spray
they
ai
got
steel
an
copper
scarce
but
they
got
some
alloys
that
are
good
tough
one
part
tungsten
or
i
crazy
tommy
nodded
turn

all
the
guns

can
he
said
i
look
for
fighting
yeah
said
smithers
miss
evelyn
still
all
right
up
to
three
hours
ago
said
tommy
grimly
every
three
hours
one
of
our
ships
lands
in
rahn
and
reports
we
give
the
rahnians
their
stuff
at
our
own
city
gates
i
warned
jacaro
that
we
mounted
on
our
food
stores
if
he
manages
to
gas
us
by
surprise
nevertheless
our
foodstuffs
ca
be
captured
they
got
to
turn
over
evelyn
and
cart
off
their
food
before
they
dare
to
fight
else
they
starve
but
uh
there
other
cities

could

said
tommy
curtly
they
got
mounted
on
their
food
supplies
too
and
they
desperate
enough
to
keep
rahn
off
they
willing
enough
to
let
yugna
do
the
fighting
but
they
know
what
rahn
winning
will
mean
smithers
turned
away
then
turned
back

said
heavily

tube
to
earth
until
the
fightin

i
try
to

it
said
tommy
impatiently
i
try
he
turned
back
to
the
steam
gun
a
flexible
pipe
from
a
heavily
insulated
cylinder
ran
to
it
a
hopper
dropped
metallic
balls
down
into
a
barrel
where
they
were
sucked
into
the
blast
of
superheated
steam
from
the
storage
cylinder
at
a
touch
of
the
trigger
a
monstrous
cloud
of
steam
poured
out
it
was
six
feet
from
the
gun
muzzle
before
it
condensed
enough
to
be
visible
then
a
huge
white
cloud
developed
but
the
metal
pellets
went
on
with
deadly
force
half
an
inch
in
diameter
they
carried
seven
hundred
yards
at
extreme
elevation
range
was
yards
they
would
kill
at
three
hundred
and
stun
or
disable
beyond
that
at
a
hundred
yards
they
would
tear
through
a
man
body
tommy
was
promised
a
hundred
of
the
weapons
with
their
boilers
in
two
days
he
selected
their
emplacements
he
directed
that
a
disabling
device
be
inserted
so
if
rushed
they
could
not
be
turned
against
their
owners
he
inspected
the
gas
masks
being
turned
out
by
the
women
who
in
this
emergency
worked
like
the
men
though
helpless
before
machinery
it
seemed
they
could
contrive
a
fabric
device
like
a
gas
mask
the
second
day
the
work
went
on
more
desperately
still
but
work
in
releasing
men
was
telling
there
were
fifteen
hundred
governors
or
reducing
valves
or
autocratic
in
operation
now
and
fifteen
hundred
men
were
released
from
the
machines
which
had
to
be
kept
going
to
keep
the
city
alive
with
that
many
men
intelligent
mechanics
all
tommy
and
smithers
worked
wonders
smithers
drove
them
mercilessly
using
profanity
and
mechanical
drawings
instead
of
speech
denham
withdrew
twenty
men
and
labored
on
top
of
one
of
the
towers
toward
sunset
of
the
second
day
vast
clouds
of
steam
bellied
out
from
it
at
odd
irregular
intervals
nothing
else
manifested
itself
those
irregular
belchings
of
steam
continued
until
dark
but
tommy
paid
no
attention
to
them
he
was
driving
the
gunners
of
the
machine
guns
to
practice
he
was
planning
patrols
devising
a
reserve
mounting
and
arranging
for
the
delivery
of
the
promised
ransom
at
the
specified
city
gate
so
far
there
was
no
sign
of
anything
unusual
in
rahn
messengers
from
yugna
saw
the
captive
women
regularly
once
every
three
hours
the
last
to
leave
had
reported
them
being
loaded
into
great
ground
vehicles
under
a
defending
escort
to
travel
through
the
dark
jungle
roads
to
yugna
a
vast
concourse
of
empty
vehicles
was
trailing
into
the
jungle
after
them
to
bring
back
the
food
which
would
keep
rahn
from
starving
for
a
while
it
all
seemed
wholly
regular
at
dawn
the
remaining
ships
of
the
air
fleet
of
rahn
were
soaring
silently
above
the
jungle
about
the
golden
city
they
made
no
threat
they
offered
no
affront
but
they
soared
and
soared
a
little
after
dawn
glitterings
in
the
jungle
announced
the
arrival
of
the
convoy
messengers
in
advance
shouted
the
news
men
from
yugna
went
out
to
inspect
the
atmosphere
grew
tense
the
air
fleet
of
rahn
drew
closer
slowly
a
great
golden
gateway
yawned
four
ground
vehicles
rolled
forward
and
under
escort
of
the
rahnians
entered
the
city
half
the
captive
women
from
yugna
were
within
them
they
alighted
weeping
for
joy
and
were
promptly
whisked
away
evelyn
was
not
among
them
tommy
ground
his
teeth
an
explanation
came
when
one
half
the
promised
ransom
was
paid
the
others
would
be
forthcoming
tommy
gave
grim
orders
half
the
foodstuffs
were
taken
to
the
city
gate
half
no
more
at
his
direction
it
was
explained
gently
to
the
rahnians
that
the
rest
of
the
ransom
remained
under
guard
of
the
it
would
not
be
exposed
to
capture
until
the
last
of
the
captives
were
released
there
was
argument
expostulation
the
rest
of
the
women
appeared
aten
at
tommy
express
command
piled
evelyn
and
his
own
wife
into
a
ground
vehicle
and
came
racing
madly
to
the
tower
from
which
tommy
could
see
all
the
circuit
of
the
city
you
all
right
asked
tommy
at
evelyn
speechless
nod
he
put
his
hand
heavily
on
her
shoulder
i
glad
he
managed
to
say
put
on
that
gas
mask
hell
going
to
pop
in
a
minute
he
watched
every
muscle
tense
there
was
confusion
about
the
city
gate
ground
vehicles
loaded
with
foodstuffs
poured
out
of
the
gate
and
back
toward
the
jungle
other
vehicles
with
improvised
enlargements
to
their
carrying
platforms
making
them
into
huge
closed
boxes
rolled
up
to
the
gate
the
loaded
vehicles
rolled
back
and
back
and
back
and
ever
more
apparently
empty
ones
crowded
about
the
city
gate
waiting
for
admission
then
there
was
a
sudden
flare
of
intolerable
light
a
wild
yell
arose
clouds
of
steam
shot
up
from
the
ready
steam
guns
but
the
circling
air
fleet
turned
as
one
ship
and
plunged
for
the
city
the
leaders
began
to
drop
smoking
things
that
turned
into
monstrous
pillars
of
mist
a
wave
of
deadly
vapor
rolled
over
the
ramparts
of
the
city
and
then
there
was
a
ululation
and
the
noise
of
battle
ragged
men
hidden
in
the
jungle
had
swarmed
upon
the
walls
with
ladders
made
of
jungle
reeds
they
came
over
the
parapet
in
a
wave
of
howling
madness
and
they
surged
into
the
city
flinging
gas
bombs
as
they
came
chapter
x
the
city
was
pandemonium
tommy
looking
down
from
his
post
of
command
swore
softly
under
his
breath
the
death
mist
was
harmless
to
the
defenders
of
yugna
as
a
gas
because
of
their
gas
masks
but
it
served
as
a
screen
it
blotted
out
the
waves
of
attackers
so
the
steam
guns
could
not
be
aimed
save
at
the
shortest
of
short
ranges
his
precautions
were
taking
effect
to
be
sure
two
thirds
of
the
attackers
were
ragged
men
drawn
from
about
half
the
surviving
cities
and
against
such
a
horde
yugna
could
not
have
held
out
at
all
but
for
his
preparations
now
the
defenders
took
a
heavy
toll
swarms
of
men
came
racing
toward
the
open
gate
their
truncheons
aglow
in
the
sunlight
the
ring
of
death
mist
was
contracting
as
if
to
strangle
the
city
and
it
left
the
ramparts
bare
again
and
from
more
than
one
point
upon
the
battlements
the
roaring
clouds
of
steam
burst
out
again
a
dozen
guns
concentrated
on
the
racing
men
of
rahn
plunging
from
the
jungle
to
enter
by
the
gate
they
were
racing
forward
without
order
but
at
top
speed
to
share
in
the
fighting
and
loot
then
streams
of
metal
balls
tore
into
them
the
front
of
the
irregular
column
was
wiped
out
utterly
wide
swathes
were
cut
in
the
rest
the
survivors
ran
wildly
forward
over
a
litter
of
dead
and
dying
men
weapons
sent
crackling
discharges
among
them
their
contorted
figures
reeled
and
fell
or
leaped
convulsively
to
lie
forever
still
where
they
struck
and
then
the
steam
guns
turned
about
to
fire
into
the
rear
of
the
men
who
had
charged
past
them
the
steam
guns
had
literally
blasted
away
the
line
of
ragged
men
where
they
stood
but
the
line
went
on
with
great
ragged
gaps
in
it
to
be
sure
but
still
vastly
outnumbering
the
defenders
of
the
city
here
and
there
a
steam
gun
was
silent
its
gun
crew
dead
and
presently
those
that
were
left
were
useless
immobile
upon
the
ramparts
in
the
rear
of
the
attack
down
in
the
ways
of
the
city
the
fight
rose
to
a
riotous
clamor
at
tommy
order
the
women
of
the
city
had
been
concentrated
into
a
few
strong
towers
the
machines
of
the
city
were
left
undefended
for
a
time
a
few
strong
patrols
of
fighting
men
strategically
placed
flung
themselves
with
irresistible
force
upon
certain
bands
of
maddened
ragged
men
but
where
a
combat
raged
there
the
ragged
men
swarmed
howling
their
hatred
impelled
them
to
suicidal
courage
and
to
unspeakable
atrocities
from
his
tower
tommy
saw
a
man
of
yugna
evidently
a
prisoner
four
ragged
men
surrounded
him
literally
tearing
him
to
pieces
like
the
maniacs
they
were
then
he
saw
dust
spurting
up
in
a
line
and
all
four
ragged
men
twitched
and
collapsed
on
top
of
their
victim
a
steam
gun
had
done
that
a
fighting
patrol
of
the
men
of
yugna
swept
fiercely
down
a
paved
way
in
one
of
the
golden
city
vehicles
there
was
the
glint
of
gold
from
it
a
solid
choked
mass
of
invaders
rushed
upon
it
without
slackening
speed
without
a
pause
the
vehicle
raced
ahead
intolerable
flashes
of
light
appeared
a
was
mounted
on
the
machine
it
drove
forward
like
a
flaming
meteor
and
as
weapons
flashed
upon
it
men
screamed
and
died
it
tore
into
a
vast
cloud
of
the
death
mist
and
the
unbearable
flames
of
its
weapon
could
only
be
seen
as
illuminations
of
that
deadly
vapor
a
part
of
the
city
was
free
of
defenders
save
the
isolated
steam
gunners
left
behind
upon
the
walls
ragged
men
drunk
with
success
ran
through
its
ways
slashing
at
the
walls
battering
at
the
pounding
upon
the
doorways
of
the
towers
tommy
saw
them
hacking
at
the
great
doorway
of
a
tower
it
gave
they
rushed
within
almost
instantly
thereafter
the
opening
spouted
them
forth
again
and
after
them
leaping
upon
them
snapping
and
biting
and
striking
out
with
monstrous
paws
and
teeth
were
green
like
the
one
that
had
been
killed
years
back
it
seemed
on
earth
a
deadly
combat
began
instantly
but
when
the
last
of
the
fighting
creatures
was
down
no
more
than
a
dozen
were
left
of
the
three
score
who
had
begun
the
fight
but
this
was
not
the
main
battle
the
main
battle
was
hidden
under
the
cloud
concentrated
in
a
vast
thick
mass
in
the
very
center
of
the
city
tommy
watched
that
grimly
perhaps
eight
thousand
men
had
assailed
the
city
certainly
two
thousand
of
them
were
represented
by
the
still
or
twitching
forms
in
queer
attitudes
here
and
there
in
single
dots
or
groups
there
were
seven
hundred
corpses
before
the
city
gate
alone
where
the
steam
guns
had
mowed
down
a
reinforcing
column
and
there
were
others
scattered
all
about
the
defenders
had
lost
heavily
enough
but
tommy
defense
behind
the
line
of
the
ramparts
was
soundly
concentrated
in
strong
points
equipped
with
steam
guns
and
mostly
armed
with
as
well
from
the
center
of
the
city
there
came
only
a
vast
unorganized
tumult
of
battle
and
death
then
a
huge
winged
thing
came
soaring
down
past
tommy
tower
it
landed
with
a
crash
on
the
roofs
below
spilling
its
men
like
ants
tommy
strained
his
eyes
there
was
a
billowing
outburst
of
steam
from
the
tower
where
denham
had
been
working
the
night
before
a
big
flier
burst
into
the
weird
bright
flame
of
the
thermit
fluid
it
fell
splitting
apart
as
it
dropped
again
the
billowing
steam
no
result
but
beyond
the
city
walls
showed
a
flash
of
thermit
flame
denham
muttered
tommy
he
got
a
steam
cannon
he
shooting
shells
loaded
with
thermit
they
smash
when
they
hit
good
he
dispatched
a
man
with
orders
but
a
messenger
was
panting
his
way
up
as
the
runner
left
he
thrust
a
scribbled
bit
of
paper
into
hand
i
trying
to
bring
down
the
ship
that
controlling
the
death
mist
i
shell
those
devils
in
the
middle
of
town
as
soon
as
our
controls
can
handle
the
mist
denham
tommy
began
to
snap
out
his
commands
he
raced
downward
toward
the
street
men
seemed
to
spring
up
like
magic
about
him
a
ship
with
one
wing
aflame
was
tottering
in
and
another
was
dropping
like
a
plummet
then
tommy
uttered
a
roar
of
pure
joy
the
huge
globe
of
beautiful
deadly
vapor
was
lifting
its
was
shattered
and
men
of
the
golden
city
had
found
its
setting
the
mist
rose
swiftly
in
a
single
vast
globule
of
varicolored
reflections
and
the
situation
in
the
center
of
the
city
was
clear
two
towers
were
besieged
dense
masses
of
the
invaders
crowded
about
them
battering
at
them
steam
guns
opened
from
their
windows
shot
out
flashes
of
deadly
fire
tommy
led
five
hundred
men
in
savage
assault
cleaving
the
mass
of
invaders
like
a
wedge
he
cut
off
a
hundred
men
and
wiped
them
out
while
a
rear
guard
poured
electric
charges
into
the
main
body
of
the
enemy
more
men
of
yugna
came
leaping
from
a
dozen
doorways
and
joined
them
tommy
found
smithers
by
his
side
and
miss
evelyn
all
right
smithers
asked
in
a
great
calm
she
is
growled
tommy
on
the
top
floor
of
a
tower
with
a
hundred
men
to
guard
her
you
did
look
at
the
tube
i
made
said
smithers
impassively
but
i
turned
on
the
steam
looks
like
it
worked
it
ready
to
go
through
anyways
it
the
same
place
the
other
one
was
down
in
that
cellar
i
tellin
you
in
case
anything
happens
he
opened
fire
with
a
magazine
rifle
into
the
thick
of
the
mob
that
assailed
the
two
towers
tommy
left
him
with
fifty
men
to
block
a
highway
and
led
his
men
again
into
the
mass
of
mingled
ragged
men
and
rahnians
his
followers
saw
his
tactics
now
they
split
off
a
section
of
the
mob
and
fell
upon
it
ferociously
there
were
sudden
awful
screams
thermit
flame
was
rising
from
two
places
in
the
very
thick
of
the
mob
it
burst
up
from
a
third
and
fourth
and
fifth
denham
atop
his
tower
had
the
range
with
his
steam
cannon
and
was
flinging
heavy
shells
into
the
attackers
of
the
two
central
buildings
and
then
there
was
a
roaring
of
steam
and
a
ground
vehicle
came
to
a
stop
not
fifty
feet
away
a
gun
crew
of
yugnans
had
shifted
their
unwieldy
weapon
and
its
insulated
steam
boiler
to
a
vehicle
now
the
gunner
pulled
trigger
and
traversed
his
weapon
into
the
thick
of
the
massed
invaders
while
his
companions
worked
desperately
to
keep
the
hopper
full
of
projectiles
the
invaders
melted
away
steam
guns
in
the
towers
thermit
projectiles
from
the
cannon
far
away
now
this
and
the
concealing
cloud
of
death
mist
was
rising
still
headed
straight
up
toward
the
zenith
it
looked
like
a
tiny
dwindling
pearl
the
assault
upon
yugna
had
been
a
mad
one
a
frantic
one
but
the
flight
from
yugna
was
the
flight
of
men
trying
to
escape
from
hell
wild
panic
characterized
the
fleeing
men
they
threw
aside
their
weapons
and
ran
with
screams
of
terror
no
whit
less
horrible
than
their
howls
of
triumph
had
been
and
tommy
would
have
stopped
the
slaughter
but
there
was
no
way
to
send
orders
to
the
rampart
gunners
in
time
as
the
fugitives
swarmed
toward
the
walls
again
the
storms
of
missiles
mowed
them
down
even
those
who
scrambled
down
to
the
ground
outside
and
fled
sobbing
for
the
jungle
were
pursued
by
hails
of
bullets
of
the
eight
thousand
men
who
assailed
yugna
less
than
one
in
five
escaped
pursuit
was
still
in
progress
here
and
there
through
the
city
the
sound
of
isolated
combats
still
went
on
denham
came
down
from
his
tower
looking
rather
sick
as
he
saw
the
carnage
about
him
a
strong
escort
brought
evelyn
aten
was
grinning
proudly
as
though
he
had
in
person
defeated
the
enemy
and
as
evelyn
shakingly
put
out
her
hand
to
touch
tommy
arm
it
was
only
later
that
he
realized
he
had
been
wounded
in
half
a
dozen
minor
ways
a
shadow
roared
over
their
heads
the
crackle
of
firearms
came
from
it
jacaro
snarled
tommy
he
leaped
instinctively
to
pursue
but
the
flying
thing
was
bound
for
a
landing
in
an
open
square
the
same
one
which
not
long
since
had
seen
the
heaviest
fighting
it
alighted
there
and
toppled
askew
on
contact
figures
tumbled
out
of
it
in
torn
and
ragged
garments
fashioned
in
the
style
of
the
very
best
tailors
of
the
earth
underworld
men
of
yugna
raced
to
intercept
them
firearms
spat
and
bellowed
luridly
in
a
group
the
knot
of
men
raced
over
fallen
bodies
and
hurtled
areas
where
the
pavement
had
cooled
to
no
more
than
a
heat
where
a
thermit
shell
had
struck
one
man
two
three
men
fell
under
the
fire
the
gangsters
went
racing
on
firing
desperately
they
dived
into
a
tunnel
and
disappeared
the
tube
roared
smithers
they
goin
for
the
tube
he
plunged
forward
and
tommy
seized
his
arm
they
go
through
your
tube
he
said
curtly
it
looks
like
the
one
they
came
through
they
think
it
is
let
smithers
tried
to
tear
free
but
they
get
back
to
earth
he
raged
they
get
off
clear
the
sharp
cracking
sound
of
a
explosion
came
out
of
the
doorway
into
which
jacaro
and
his
men
had
dived
tommy
smiled
very
grimly
indeed
they
gone
through
he
said
drily
and
they
blown
up
the
tube
behind
them
but
i
did
tell
you
i
took
a
look
at
your
castings
your
pupils
were
putting
them
together
ready
for
the
steam
to
go
in
in
place
of
the
coils
i
used
but
er
smithers
you
discarded
one
pair
of
castings
they
did
satisfy
you
your
pupils
forgot
that
they
hooked
them
all
together
smithers
gulped
instead
of
four
bends
said
tommy
grimly
you
have
six
connected
together
you
turned
on
the
steam
in
a
hurry
not
noticing
and
i
do
know
how
many
series
of
dimensions
there
are
in
this
universe
of
ours
we
know
of
two
there
may
be
any
number
but
jacaro
and
his
men
did
go
back
to
earth
god
only
knows
where
they
landed
or
what
it
like
maybe
somewhere
a
million
miles
in
space
nobody
knows
the
main
thing
is
that
earth
is
safe
now
the
death
mist
has
faded
out
of
the
picture
he
turned
and
smiled
warmly
at
evelyn
he
was
a
rather
horrible
sight
just
then
though
he
did
not
know
it
he
was
bloody
and
burned
and
wounded
he
ignored
all
matters
but
success
however
i
think
he
said
drily
we
have
won
the
confidence
of
the
golden
city
evelyn
and
that
there
be
no
more
talk
of
gassing
earth
as
soon
as
the
council
meets
again
we
make
sure
and
then
well
i
think
we
can
devote
a
certain
amount
of
time
to
our
personal
affairs
you
are
the
first
to
be
kissed
in
the
fifth
dimension
we
have
to
see
if
you
ca
distinguish
yourself
further
again
the
council
hall
in
the
tower
of
government
in
the
golden
city
of
yugna
again
the
queer
benches
about
the
black
wood
table
though
two
of
the
seats
that
had
been
occupied
were
now
empty
again
the
guards
behind
the
chairs
and
the
crowd
of
watchers
visitors
citizens
of
yugna
attending
the
deliberations
of
the
council
the
audience
was
a
queer
one
this
time
there
were
bandages
here
and
there
there
were
men
who
were
wounded
broken
bent
and
crippled
in
the
fighting
but
a
warmly
welcoming
murmur
spread
through
the
hall
as
tommy
came
in
himself
rather
extensively
patched
he
was
wearing
the
tunic
and
breeches
of
the
golden
city
because
his
own
clothes
were
hopelessly
beyond
repair
the
bearded
old
councilor
gathered
the
eyes
of
his
fellows
they
rose
this
council
seated
itself
as
one
man
quiet
placid
formalities
the
keeper
of
foodstuffs
murmured
that
the
ransom
paid
to
rahn
had
been
recaptured
after
the
fight
the
keeper
of
rolls
reported
with
savage
satisfaction
the
number
of
enemies
who
had
been
slain
in
battle
he
added
that
the
loss
to
yugna
was
less
than
one
man
to
ten
of
the
enemy
and
he
added
with
still
greater
emphasis
that
the
shops
being
fitted
with
automatic
controls
had
released
now
it
had
grown
so
much
two
thousand
men
from
the
necessary
working
force
and
further
releases
were
to
be
expected
the
demands
of
the
machines
were
lessened
already
beyond
the
memory
of
man
eyes
turned
to
tommy
there
was
an
expectant
pause
for
his
reply
i
have
been
commander
of
defense
forces
he
told
them
slowly
in
this
fighting
i
have
given
you
weapons
my
two
friends
have
done
more
the
machines
will
need
fewer
and
fewer
attendants
as
the
hints
they
have
given
you
are
developed
by
yourselves
and
there
is
some
hope
that
one
of
my
friends
may
show
you
in
vibrations
a
weapon
against
the
jungle
itself
my
own
work
is
finished
but
i
ask
again
for
friendship
for
my
planet
earth
i
ask
that
no
war
be
made
on
my
own
people
i
ask
that
what
benefits
you
receive
from
us
be
passed
to
the
other
surviving
cities
on
the
same
terms
and
since
there
can
be
no
further
fighting
on
this
scale
i
give
back
my
commission
as
commander
of
defense
there
was
a
little
murmur
among
the
men
of
yugna
looking
on
it
rose
to
a
protesting
babble
to
a
shout
of
denial
the
bearded
old
keeper
of
foodstuffs
smiled
it
is
proposed
that
the
appointment
as
commander
of
defense
forces
be
permanent
he
said
mildly
he
produced
the
queer
black
box
and
touched
it
in
a
certain
fashion
he
passed
it
to
the
next
man
and
the
next
and
next
it
went
around
the
table
it
passed
a
second
time
but
this
time
each
man
merely
looked
at
the
top
you
command
the
defense
forces
of
yugna
for
always
said
the
bearded
old
man
gently
now
give
orders
that
your
requests
become
laws
tommy
stared
blankly
he
was
suddenly
aware
of
aten
in
the
background
smiling
triumphantly
and
very
happily
at
him
there
was
something
like
a
roar
of
approval
from
the
men
of
yugna
assembled
just
what
demanded
tommy
does
this
mean
for
many
years
said
a
man
ungraciously
we
have
had
no
commander
of
defense
we
have
had
no
wars
but
we
see
it
is
needful
we
have
chosen
you
with
all
agreeing
the
commander
of
defense
he
sniffed
a
little
pugnaciously
has
the
authority
the
ancient
kings
once
owned
tommy
leaned
back
in
the
curious
benchlike
chair
his
eyes
narrow
and
thoughtful
this
would
simplify
matters
no
danger
of
trouble
to
earth
a
free
hand
for
denham
and
smithers
to
help
these
folk
and
for
denham
to
learn
scientific
facts
in
the
sciences
they
had
developed
which
would
be
of
inestimable
value
to
earth
and
it
could
be
possible
to
open
a
peaceful
trade
with
the
nations
of
earth
without
any
danger
of
war
and
maybe
he
smiled
suddenly
it
widened
almost
into
a
grin
all
right
i
settle
down
here
for
a
while
but
er
just
how
does
one
set
about
getting
married
here
