on

long
bridge
illustration
our
stork
on
the
outskirts
of
the
ancient
town
of
ribe
on
the
danish
north
seacoast
a
wooden
bridge
spanned
the
nibs
river
when
i
was
a
boy
a
frail
structure
with
twin
arches
like
the
humps
of
a
dromedary
for
boats
to
go
under
upon
it
my
story
begins
the
bridge
is
long
since
gone
the
lane
that
knew
our
romping
feet
leads
nowhere
now
but
in
my
memory
it
is
all
as
it
was
that
day
nearly
forty
years
ago
and
it
is
always
summer
there
the
bees
are
droning
among
the
that
grow
along
shore
and
the
swans
arch
their
necks
in
the
limpid
stream
the
clatter
of
the
down
at
the
dam
comes
up
with
drowsy
hum
the
sweet
smells
of
meadow
and
field
are
in
the
air
on
the
bridge
a
boy
and
a
girl
have
met
he
whistles
a
tune
with
worsted
jacket
slung
across
his
arm
on
his
way
home
from
the
carpenter
shop
to
his
midday
meal
when
she
has
passed
he
stands
looking
after
her
all
the
music
gone
out
of
him
at
the
other
end
of
the
bridge
she
turns
with
the
feeling
that
he
is
looking
and
when
she
sees
that
he
is
goes
on
with
a
little
toss
of
her
pretty
head
as
she
stands
one
brief
moment
there
with
the
roguish
look
she
is
to
stand
in
his
heart
forever
a
sweet
girlish
figure
in
jacket
of
gray
with
schoolbooks
and
pretty
bronzed
boots
with
tassels
says
my
wife
maliciously
she
has
been
looking
over
my
shoulder
well
with
tassels
what
then
did
i
not
worship
a
pair
of
boots
with
tassels
which
i
passed
in
a
shop
window
in
copenhagen
every
day
for
a
whole
year
because
they
were
the
only
other
pair
i
ever
saw
i
do
know
there
may
have
been
more
perhaps
others
wore
them
i
know
she
did
curls
she
had
too
curls
of
yellow
gold
why
do
girls
not
have
curls
these
days
it
is
such
a
rare
thing
to
see
them
that
when
you
do
you
feel
like
walking
behind
them
miles
and
miles
just
to
feast
your
eyes
too
much
bother
says
my
daughter
bother
why
i
have
carried
one
of
your
mother
miss
all
these
there
i
shall
not
say
how
long
and
carry
it
still
bother
great
scott
illustration
the
meeting
on
the
long
bridge
and
is
this
going
to
be
a
love
story
then
well
i
have
turned
it
over
and
over
and
looked
at
it
from
every
angle
but
if
i
am
to
tell
the
truth
as
i
promised
i
do
see
how
it
can
be
helped
if
i
am
to
do
that
i
must
begin
at
the
long
bridge
i
stepped
on
it
that
day
a
boy
and
came
off
it
with
the
fixed
purpose
of
a
man
how
i
stuck
to
it
is
part
of
the
story
the
best
part
to
my
thinking
and
i
ought
to
know
seeing
that
our
silver
wedding
comes
this
march
silver
wedding
humph
she
is
a
week
older
than
the
day
i
married
her
not
a
week
it
was
all
in
the
way
of
her
that
i
came
here
though
at
the
time
i
am
speaking
of
i
rather
guessed
than
knew
it
was
elizabeth
she
lived
over
there
beyond
the
bridge
we
had
been
children
together
i
suppose
i
had
seen
her
a
thousand
times
before
without
noticing
in
school
i
had
heard
the
boys
trading
in
her
for
marbles
and
brass
buttons
as
a
partner
at
dances
and
games
generally
trading
off
the
other
girls
for
her
she
was
such
a
pretty
dancer
i
was
not
soldiers
and
robbers
was
more
to
my
taste
that
any
girl
with
curls
or
without
should
be
worth
a
good
marble
or
a
regimental
button
with
a
sound
eye
that
could
be
strung
was
rank
foolishness
to
me
until
that
day
on
the
bridge
and
now
i
shall
have
to
recross
it
after
all
to
tell
who
and
what
we
were
that
we
may
start
fair
i
shall
have
to
go
slow
too
for
back
of
that
day
everything
seems
very
indistinct
and
strange
a
few
things
stand
out
more
clearly
than
the
rest
the
day
for
instance
when
i
was
first
dragged
off
to
school
by
an
avenging
housemaid
and
thrust
howling
into
an
empty
hogshead
by
the
ogre
of
a
schoolmarm
who
when
she
had
put
the
lid
on
gnashed
her
yellow
teeth
at
the
bunghole
and
told
me
that
so
bad
boys
were
dealt
with
in
school
at
recess
she
had
me
up
to
the
in
the
yard
as
a
further
warning
the
pig
had
a
slit
in
the
ear
it
was
for
being
lazy
she
explained
and
showed
me
the
shears
boys
were
no
better
than
pigs
some
were
worse
then
a
jab
at
the
air
with
the
scissors
told
the
rest
poor
father
he
was
a
schoolmaster
too
how
much
sorrow
it
might
have
spared
him
had
he
known
of
this
but
we
were
too
scared
to
tell
i
suppose
he
had
set
his
heart
upon
my
taking
up
his
calling
and
i
hated
the
school
from
the
day
i
first
saw
it
small
wonder
the
only
study
he
succeeded
in
interesting
me
in
was
english
because
charles
dickens
paper
the
year
came
to
the
house
with
stories
ever
so
much
more
alluring
than
the
tedious
grammar
he
was
of
the
old
dispensation
wedded
to
the
old
ways
but
the
short
cut
i
took
to
knowledge
in
that
branch
i
think
opened
his
eyes
to
some
things
ahead
of
his
time
their
day
had
not
yet
come
he
lived
to
see
it
dawn
and
was
glad
i
know
how
he
felt
about
it
i
myself
have
lived
down
the
day
of
the
hogshead
in
the
of
new
york
some
of
the
schools
our
women
made
an
end
of
a
few
years
ago
were
much
better
to
help
clean
them
out
was
like
getting
square
with
the
ogre
that
plagued
my
childhood
i
mind
too
my
first
collision
with
the
tenement
there
was
just
one
and
it
stood
over
against
the
castle
hill
separated
from
it
only
by
the
dry
moat
we
called
it
rag
hall
and
i
guess
it
deserved
the
name
ribe
was
a
very
old
town
five
hundred
years
ago
or
so
it
had
been
the
seat
of
the
fighting
kings
when
denmark
was
a
power
to
be
reckoned
with
there
they
were
handy
when
trouble
broke
out
with
the
german
barons
to
the
south
but
the
times
changed
and
of
all
its
greatness
there
remained
to
ribe
only
its
famed
cathedral
with
eight
centuries
upon
its
hoary
head
and
its
latin
school
of
the
castle
of
the
valdemars
there
was
left
only
this
green
hill
with
solemn
sheep
browsing
upon
it
and
into
the
sunset
in
the
moats
where
once
ships
sailed
in
from
the
sea
great
billowy
masses
of
reeds
ever
bent
and
swayed
under
the
west
wind
that
swept
over
the
meadows
they
grew
much
taller
than
our
heads
and
we
boys
loved
to
play
in
them
to
track
the
tiger
or
the
grizzly
to
its
lair
not
without
creeping
shudders
at
the
peril
that
might
lie
in
ambush
at
the
next
turn
or
hidden
deep
down
among
them
we
lay
and
watched
the
white
clouds
go
overhead
and
listened
to
the
reeds
whispering
of
the
great
days
and
deeds
that
were
illustration
ribe
from
the
castle
hill
the
castle
hill
was
the
only
high
ground
about
the
town
it
was
said
in
some
book
of
travel
that
one
might
see
miles
in
any
direction
from
ribe
lying
flat
on
one
back
but
that
was
drawing
the
long
bow
flat
the
landscape
was
undeniably
from
the
top
of
the
castle
hill
we
could
see
the
sun
setting
upon
the
sea
and
the
islands
lying
high
in
fine
weather
as
if
floating
in
the
air
the
nibs
winding
its
silvery
way
through
the
green
fields
not
a
tree
hardly
a
house
hindered
the
view
it
was
grass
all
grass
for
miles
to
the
sand
dunes
and
the
beach
strangers
went
into
ecstasy
over
the
little
woodland
patch
down
by
the
long
bridge
and
very
sweet
and
pretty
it
was
but
to
me
who
was
born
there
the
wide
view
to
the
sea
the
green
meadows
with
the
lonesome
flight
of
the
and
the
curlew
call
in
the
were
dearer
far
with
all
their
melancholy
more
than
mountains
in
their
majesty
more
infinitely
more
than
the
city
of
teeming
millions
with
all
its
wealth
and
might
they
seem
to
me
to
typify
human
freedom
and
the
struggle
for
it
thence
came
the
vikings
that
roved
the
seas
serving
no
man
as
master
and
through
the
dark
ages
of
feudalism
no
lord
long
bent
the
neck
of
those
stout
yeomen
to
the
yoke
germany
forgetting
honor
treaties
and
history
is
trying
to
do
it
now
in
slesvig
south
of
the
nibs
and
she
will
as
surely
fail
the
day
of
justice
when
dynasties
by
the
grace
of
god
shall
have
been
replaced
by
government
by
right
of
the
people
will
find
them
unconquered
still
alas
i
am
afraid
that
thirty
years
in
the
land
of
my
birth
have
left
me
as
much
of
a
dane
as
ever
i
no
sooner
climb
the
castle
hill
than
i
am
fighting
tooth
and
nail
the
hereditary
foes
of
my
people
whom
it
was
built
high
to
bar
yet
would
you
have
it
otherwise
what
sort
of
a
husband
is
the
man
going
to
make
who
begins
by
pitching
his
old
mother
out
of
the
door
to
make
room
for
his
wife
and
what
sort
of
a
wife
would
she
be
to
ask
or
to
stand
it
but
i
was
speaking
of
the
tenement
by
the
moat
it
was
a
ramshackle
affair
with
shiftless
tenants
and
ragged
children
looking
back
now
i
think
likely
it
was
the
contrast
of
its
desolation
with
the
green
hill
and
the
fields
i
loved
of
its
darkness
and
human
misery
and
inefficiency
with
the
valiant
fighting
men
of
my
boyish
dreams
that
so
impressed
me
i
believe
it
because
it
is
so
now
over
against
the
tenement
that
we
fight
in
our
cities
ever
rises
in
my
mind
the
fields
the
woods
god
open
sky
as
accuser
and
witness
that
his
temple
is
being
so
defiled
man
so
dwarfed
in
body
and
soul
illustration
the
view
the
stork
got
of
the
old
town
i
know
that
rag
hall
displeased
me
very
much
i
presume
there
must
have
been
something
of
an
inquiring
yankee
twist
to
my
for
the
boys
called
me
jacob
the
delver
mainly
because
of
my
constant
bothering
with
the
sewerage
of
our
house
which
was
of
the
most
primitive
kind
an
open
gutter
that
was
full
of
rats
led
under
the
house
to
the
likewise
open
gutter
of
the
street
that
was
all
there
was
of
it
and
very
bad
it
was
but
it
had
always
been
so
and
as
consequently
it
could
not
be
otherwise
my
energies
spent
themselves
in
unending
warfare
with
those
rats
whose
nests
choked
the
gutter
i
could
hardly
have
been
over
twelve
or
thirteen
when
rag
hall
challenged
my
resentment
my
methods
in
dealing
with
it
had
at
least
the
merit
of
directness
if
they
added
nothing
to
the
sum
of
human
knowledge
or
happiness
i
had
received
a
mark
which
was
a
coin
like
our
silver
quarter
on
christmas
eve
and
i
hied
myself
to
rag
hall
at
once
to
divide
it
with
the
poorest
family
there
on
the
express
condition
that
they
should
tidy
up
things
especially
those
children
and
generally
change
their
way
of
living
the
man
took
the
money
i
have
a
vague
recollection
of
seeing
a
stunned
look
on
his
face
and
i
believe
brought
it
back
to
our
house
to
see
if
it
was
all
right
thereby
giving
me
great
offence
but
he
did
the
best
for
himself
that
way
for
so
rag
hall
came
under
the
notice
of
my
mother
too
and
there
really
was
some
whitewashing
done
and
the
children
were
cleaned
up
for
a
season
so
that
the
eight
skilling
were
if
not
wisely
yet
well
invested
after
all
illustration
the
domkirke
illustration
within
the
domkirke
no
doubt
christmas
had
something
to
do
with
it
poverty
and
misery
always
seem
to
jar
more
at
the
time
when
the
whole
world
makes
merry
we
took
an
entire
week
off
to
keep
christmas
in
till
after
new
year
day
no
one
thought
of
anything
else
the
holy
eve
was
the
greatest
of
the
year
then
the
domkirke
shone
with
a
thousand
wax
candles
that
made
the
gloom
in
the
deep
recesses
behind
the
granite
pillars
seem
deeper
still
and
brought
out
the
picture
of
the
virgin
mary
and
her
child
long
hidden
under
the
whitewash
of
the
reformation
and
so
preserved
to
our
day
by
the
very
means
taken
to
destroy
it
the
people
sang
the
dear
old
hymns
about
the
child
cradled
in
the
manger
and
mother
tears
fell
in
her
dear
old
mother
she
had
a
house
full
and
little
enough
to
manage
with
but
never
one
went
hungry
or
unhelped
from
her
door
i
am
a
believer
in
organized
systematic
charity
upon
the
evidence
of
my
senses
but
i
am
glad
we
have
that
one
season
in
which
we
can
forget
our
principles
and
err
on
the
side
of
mercy
that
little
corner
in
the
days
of
the
dying
year
for
sentiment
and
no
questions
asked
no
need
to
be
afraid
it
is
safe
christmas
charity
never
corrupts
love
keeps
it
sweet
and
good
the
love
he
brought
into
the
world
at
christmas
to
temper
the
hard
reason
of
man
let
it
loose
for
that
little
spell
january
comes
soon
enough
with
its
long
cold
always
it
seems
to
me
the
longest
month
in
the
year
it
is
so
far
to
another
christmas
illustration
mother
to
say
that
ribe
was
an
old
town
hardly
describes
it
to
readers
at
this
day
a
town
might
be
old
and
yet
have
kept
step
with
time
in
my
day
ribe
had
not
it
had
never
changed
its
step
or
its
ways
since
lanterns
first
hung
in
iron
chains
across
its
streets
to
light
them
at
night
there
they
hung
yet
every
rusty
link
squeaking
dolefully
in
the
wind
that
never
ceased
blowing
from
the
sea
just
come
from
america
was
regarded
as
a
dangerous
innovation
i
remember
buying
a
bottle
of
pennsylvania
oil
at
the
grocer
for
eight
skilling
as
a
doubtful
domestic
experiment
steel
pens
had
not
crowded
out
the
and
meant
just
what
their
name
implies
matches
were
yet
of
the
future
we
carried
to
strike
fire
with
people
shook
their
heads
at
the
telegraph
the
day
of
the
was
not
yet
past
steamboat
and
railroad
had
not
come
within
forty
miles
of
the
town
and
only
one
steam
factory
a
cotton
mill
that
was
owned
by
elizabeth
father
at
the
time
of
the
beginning
of
my
story
he
having
made
much
money
during
the
early
years
of
the
american
war
through
foresight
in
having
supplied
himself
with
cotton
was
building
another
and
larger
and
i
helped
to
put
it
up
of
progress
and
enterprise
he
held
an
absolute
monopoly
in
ribe
and
though
he
employed
more
than
half
of
its
working
force
it
is
not
far
from
the
truth
that
he
was
unpopular
on
that
account
it
could
not
be
well
otherwise
in
a
town
whose
militia
company
yet
drilled
with
muskets
those
we
had
in
the
school
for
the
use
of
the
big
boys
dreadful
old
blunderbusses
of
the
era
were
of
the
same
pattern
i
remember
the
fright
that
seized
our
worthy
rector
when
the
german
army
was
approaching
in
the
winter
of
and
the
haste
they
made
to
pack
them
all
up
in
a
box
and
send
them
out
to
be
sunk
in
the
deep
lest
they
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
and
the
consternation
that
sat
upon
their
faces
when
they
saw
the
prussian
the
watchmen
still
cried
the
hour
at
night
they
do
for
that
matter
yet
the
railroad
came
to
town
and
the
march
of
improvement
struck
it
after
i
had
gone
away
institutions
were
ruthlessly
upset
the
police
force
which
in
my
boyhood
consisted
of
a
man
and
a
half
that
is
one
with
a
wooden
leg
was
increased
and
uniformed
and
the
night
watchmen
chant
was
stopped
but
there
are
limits
to
everything
the
town
that
had
been
waked
every
hour
of
the
night
since
the
early
middle
ages
to
be
told
that
it
slept
soundly
could
not
possibly
take
a
night
rest
without
it
it
lay
awake
dreading
all
sorts
of
unknown
disasters
universal
insomnia
threatened
it
and
within
a
month
on
petition
of
the
entire
community
the
council
restored
the
songsters
and
they
squeak
to
this
day
this
may
sound
like
exaggeration
but
it
is
not
it
is
a
faithful
record
of
what
took
place
and
stands
so
upon
the
official
minutes
of
the
municipality
illustration
the
deserted
quay
when
i
was
in
denmark
last
year
i
looked
over
some
of
those
old
reports
and
had
more
than
one
melancholy
laugh
at
the
account
of
measures
taken
for
the
defence
of
ribe
at
the
first
assault
of
the
germans
in
that
was
the
year
i
was
born
ribe
being
a
border
town
on
the
line
of
the
coveted
territory
set
about
arming
itself
to
resist
invasion
the
citizens
built
barricades
in
the
streets
one
of
them
with
wise
forethought
in
front
of
the
drug
store
in
case
any
one
were
to
faint
and
stand
in
need
of
drops
or
the
women
filled
kettles
with
hot
water
in
the
houses
flanking
an
eventual
advance
two
hundred
pounds
of
powder
were
ordered
from
the
next
town
by
and
a
cannon
that
had
stood
half
buried
a
hundred
years
serving
for
a
was
dug
up
and
put
into
commission
there
being
a
scarcity
of
guns
the
curate
of
the
next
village
reported
arming
his
host
with
spears
and
as
the
next
best
thing
a
rumor
of
a
sudden
advance
of
the
enemy
sent
the
mothers
with
babes
in
arms
scurrying
north
for
safety
my
mother
was
among
them
i
was
a
month
old
at
the
time
thirty
years
later
i
battled
for
the
mastery
in
the
police
office
in
mulberry
street
with
a
reporter
for
the
whom
i
discovered
to
be
one
of
those
invaders
and
i
took
it
out
of
him
in
revenge
old
cohen
carried
a
danish
bullet
in
his
arm
to
remind
him
of
his
early
but
it
was
not
fired
in
defence
of
ribe
that
collapsed
when
a
staff
officer
of
the
government
who
had
been
sent
out
to
report
upon
the
zeal
of
the
ribe
men
declared
that
the
town
could
be
defended
only
by
damming
the
river
and
flooding
the
meadows
which
would
cost
two
hundred
daler
the
minutes
of
the
council
represent
that
that
was
held
to
be
too
great
a
price
to
pay
for
the
privilege
of
being
sacked
perhaps
as
a
captured
town
and
the
citizen
army
disbanded
illustration
downstream
where
ships
sailed
once
if
the
coming
of
the
invading
army
could
have
been
timed
to
suit
the
sea
which
from
old
was
the
bulwark
of
the
nation
might
have
completed
the
defences
of
ribe
without
other
expense
to
it
than
that
of
repairing
damages
two
or
three
times
a
year
usually
in
the
fall
when
it
blew
long
and
hard
from
the
northwest
it
broke
in
over
the
low
meadows
and
flooded
the
country
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
then
the
high
causeways
were
the
refuge
of
everything
that
lived
in
the
fields
hares
mice
foxes
and
partridges
huddled
there
shivering
in
the
shower
of
spray
that
shot
over
the
road
and
making
such
stand
as
they
could
against
the
fierce
blast
if
the
storm
flood
came
early
in
the
season
before
the
cattle
had
been
housed
there
was
a
worse
story
to
tell
then
the
town
butcher
went
upon
the
causeway
at
daybreak
with
the
implements
of
his
trade
to
save
if
possible
by
letting
the
blood
at
least
the
meat
of
drowned
cattle
and
sheep
that
were
cast
up
by
the
sea
when
it
rose
higher
and
washed
over
the
road
the
picked
its
way
warily
between
white
posts
set
on
both
sides
to
guide
it
safe
we
boys
caught
fish
in
the
streets
of
the
town
while
red
tiles
flew
from
the
roofs
all
about
us
and
we
enjoyed
ourselves
hugely
it
was
part
of
the
duty
of
the
watchmen
who
cried
the
hours
to
give
warning
if
the
sea
came
in
suddenly
during
the
night
and
when
we
heard
it
we
shivered
in
our
beds
with
gruesome
delight
the
people
of
ribe
were
of
three
classes
the
officials
the
tradesmen
and
the
working
people
the
bishop
the
burgomaster
and
the
rector
of
the
latin
school
headed
the
first
class
to
which
my
father
belonged
as
the
senior
master
in
the
school
father
easily
led
the
second
class
for
the
third
it
had
no
leaders
and
nothing
to
say
at
that
time
on
state
occasions
lines
were
quite
sharply
drawn
between
the
classes
but
the
general
kindliness
of
the
people
caused
them
at
ordinary
times
to
be
so
relaxed
that
the
difference
was
hardly
to
be
noticed
theirs
was
a
real
neighborliness
that
roamed
unrestrained
and
without
prejudice
until
brought
up
with
a
round
turn
at
the
barrier
of
traditional
orthodoxy
i
remember
well
one
instance
of
that
kind
there
lived
in
our
town
a
single
family
of
jews
tradespeople
gentle
and
good
and
socially
popular
there
lived
also
a
gentile
woman
of
wealth
a
mother
in
the
strictly
lutheran
israel
who
fed
and
clothed
the
poor
and
did
no
end
of
good
she
was
a
very
pious
woman
it
so
happened
that
the
jewess
and
the
christian
were
old
friends
but
one
day
they
strayed
upon
dangerous
ground
the
jewess
saw
it
and
tried
to
turn
the
conversation
from
the
forbidden
topic
well
dear
friend
she
said
soothingly
some
day
when
we
meet
in
heaven
we
shall
all
know
better
the
barrier
was
reached
her
friend
fairly
bristled
as
she
made
reply
what
our
heaven
no
indeed
we
may
be
good
friends
here
mrs
but
there
really
you
will
have
to
excuse
me
illustration
a
cobblestone
paved
alley
narrow
streams
are
apt
to
run
deep
an
incident
which
i
set
down
in
justice
to
the
uncompromising
orthodoxy
of
that
day
made
a
strong
impression
on
me
the
two
concerned
in
it
were
my
uncle
a
generous
bright
even
a
brilliant
man
but
with
no
great
bump
of
reverence
and
the
deacon
in
the
village
church
where
they
lived
he
was
the
exact
opposite
of
my
uncle
hard
unlovely
but
deeply
religious
the
two
were
neighbors
and
quarrelled
about
their
for
months
they
did
not
speak
on
sunday
the
deacon
strode
by
on
his
way
to
church
and
my
uncle
who
stayed
home
improved
the
opportunity
to
point
out
of
what
stuff
those
pharisees
were
made
much
to
his
own
edification
easter
week
came
in
denmark
it
is
or
was
custom
to
go
to
communion
once
a
year
on
holy
thursday
if
at
no
other
season
and
i
might
add
rarely
at
any
other
on
wednesday
night
the
deacon
appeared
unbidden
at
my
uncle
door
craving
an
interview
if
a
spectre
had
suddenly
walked
in
i
do
not
suppose
he
could
have
lost
his
wits
more
completely
he
recovered
them
with
an
effort
and
bidding
his
guest
welcome
led
him
courteously
to
his
office
from
that
interview
he
came
forth
a
changed
man
long
years
after
i
heard
the
full
story
of
it
from
my
uncle
own
lips
it
was
simple
enough
the
deacon
said
that
duty
called
him
to
the
communion
table
on
the
morrow
and
that
he
could
not
reconcile
it
with
his
conscience
to
go
with
hate
toward
his
neighbor
in
his
heart
hence
he
had
come
to
tell
him
that
he
might
have
the
line
as
he
claimed
it
the
spark
struck
fire
then
and
there
they
made
up
and
were
warm
friends
though
agreeing
in
nothing
till
they
died
the
faith
said
my
uncle
in
telling
of
it
that
could
work
in
that
way
upon
such
a
nature
is
not
to
be
made
light
of
and
he
never
did
after
that
he
died
a
believing
man
it
may
be
that
it
contributed
something
to
the
ordinarily
democratic
relations
of
the
men
and
the
tradespeople
that
the
latter
were
generally
while
the
officials
mostly
had
a
running
fight
of
it
with
their
incomes
my
father
salary
had
to
reach
around
to
a
family
of
fourteen
nay
fifteen
for
he
took
his
dead
sister
child
when
a
baby
and
brought
her
up
with
us
who
were
boys
all
but
one
father
had
charge
of
the
latin
form
and
this
with
a
sense
of
grim
humor
caused
him
i
suppose
to
check
his
children
off
with
the
latin
numerals
as
it
were
the
sixth
was
baptized
sextus
the
ninth
nonus
though
they
were
not
called
so
and
he
was
dissuaded
from
calling
the
twelfth
duodecimus
only
by
the
certainty
that
the
other
boys
would
miscall
him
dozen
how
i
escaped
tertius
i
do
know
probably
the
scheme
had
not
been
thought
of
then
poor
father
of
the
whole
fourteen
but
one
lived
to
realize
his
hopes
of
a
professional
career
only
to
die
when
he
had
just
graduated
from
the
medical
school
my
oldest
brother
went
to
sea
sophus
the
doctor
was
the
next
and
i
when
it
came
my
time
to
study
in
earnest
refused
flatly
and
declared
my
wish
to
learn
the
carpenter
trade
not
till
thirty
years
after
did
i
know
how
deep
the
wound
was
i
struck
my
father
then
he
had
set
his
heart
upon
my
making
a
literary
career
and
though
he
was
very
far
from
lacking
sympathy
with
the
workingman
i
rather
think
that
he
was
the
one
link
between
the
upper
and
lower
strata
in
our
town
in
that
way
enjoying
the
most
hearty
respect
of
both
yet
it
was
a
sad
disappointment
to
him
it
was
in
when
i
saw
him
for
the
last
time
that
i
found
it
out
by
a
chance
remark
he
dropped
when
sitting
with
my
first
book
how
the
other
half
lives
in
his
hand
and
also
the
sacrifice
he
had
made
of
his
own
literary
ambitions
to
eke
out
by
hack
editorial
work
on
the
local
newspaper
a
living
for
his
large
family
as
for
me
i
would
have
been
repaid
for
the
labor
of
writing
a
thousand
books
by
witnessing
the
pride
he
took
in
mine
there
was
at
last
a
man
of
letters
in
the
family
though
he
came
by
a
road
not
down
on
the
official
map
illustration
father
crying
over
spilt
milk
was
not
my
father
fashion
however
if
i
was
to
be
a
carpenter
there
was
a
good
one
in
town
to
whom
i
was
forthwith
apprenticed
for
a
year
during
that
time
incidentally
i
might
make
up
my
mind
upon
the
evidence
of
my
reduced
standing
that
school
was
after
all
to
be
preferred
and
thus
it
was
that
i
came
to
be
a
working
boy
helping
build
her
proud
father
factory
at
the
time
i
fell
head
over
heels
in
love
with
sweet
elizabeth
certainly
i
had
taken
no
easy
road
to
the
winning
of
my
way
and
my
bride
so
reasoned
the
town
which
presently
took
note
of
my
infatuation
but
then
it
laughed
there
was
time
enough
i
was
fifteen
and
she
was
not
thirteen
there
was
time
enough
oh
yes
only
i
did
not
think
so
my
courtship
proceeded
at
a
tumultuous
pace
which
first
made
the
town
laugh
then
put
it
out
of
patience
and
made
some
staid
matrons
express
the
desire
to
box
my
ears
soundly
it
must
be
owned
that
if
courting
were
generally
done
on
the
plan
i
adopted
there
would
be
little
peace
and
less
safety
all
around
when
she
came
playing
among
the
lumber
where
we
were
working
as
she
naturally
would
danger
dogged
my
steps
i
carry
a
scar
on
the
made
with
an
adze
i
should
have
been
minding
when
i
was
looking
after
her
the
forefinger
on
my
left
hand
has
a
stiff
joint
i
cut
that
off
with
an
axe
when
she
was
dancing
on
a
beam
close
by
though
it
was
put
on
again
by
a
clever
surgeon
and
kept
on
i
have
never
had
the
use
of
it
since
but
what
did
a
finger
matter
or
ten
when
she
was
only
there
once
i
fell
off
the
roof
when
i
must
crane
my
neck
to
see
her
go
around
the
corner
but
i
hardly
took
note
of
those
things
except
to
enlist
her
sympathy
by
posing
as
a
wounded
hero
with
my
arm
in
a
sling
at
the
which
i
had
joined
on
purpose
to
dance
with
her
i
was
the
biggest
boy
there
and
therefore
first
to
choose
a
partner
and
i
remember
even
now
the
snickering
of
the
school
when
i
went
right
over
and
took
elizabeth
she
flushed
angrily
but
i
did
care
that
was
what
i
was
there
for
and
i
had
her
now
i
did
let
her
go
again
either
though
the
teacher
delicately
hinted
that
we
were
not
a
good
match
she
was
the
best
dancer
in
the
school
and
i
was
the
worst
not
a
good
match
hey
that
was
as
much
as
she
knew
about
it
it
was
at
the
ball
that
closed
the
that
i
excited
the
strong
desire
of
the
matrons
to
box
my
ears
by
ordering
father
off
the
floor
when
he
tried
to
join
in
before
midnight
the
time
set
for
the
elders
to
take
charge
i
was
floor
committee
but
how
i
could
do
such
a
thing
passes
my
understanding
except
on
the
principle
laid
down
by
dooley
that
when
a
man
is
in
love
he
is
looking
for
fight
all
around
i
must
have
been
for
they
had
to
hold
me
back
by
main
strength
from
running
away
to
the
army
that
was
fighting
a
losing
fight
with
two
great
powers
that
winter
though
i
was
far
under
age
i
was
a
big
boy
and
might
have
passed
but
the
hasty
retreat
of
our
brave
little
band
before
overwhelming
odds
settled
it
with
the
echoes
of
the
scandal
caused
by
the
ball
episode
still
ringing
i
went
off
to
copenhagen
to
serve
out
my
apprenticeship
there
with
a
great
builder
whose
name
i
saw
among
the
dead
in
the
paper
only
the
other
day
he
was
ever
a
good
friend
to
me
illustration
my
childhood
home
the
third
day
after
i
reached
the
capital
which
happened
to
be
my
birthday
i
had
appointed
a
meeting
with
my
student
brother
at
the
art
exhibition
in
the
palace
of
charlottenborg
i
found
two
stairways
running
up
from
the
main
entrance
and
was
debating
in
my
mind
which
to
take
when
a
handsome
gentleman
in
a
blue
overcoat
asked
with
a
slight
foreign
accent
if
he
could
help
me
i
told
him
my
trouble
and
we
went
up
together
we
walked
slowly
and
carried
on
quite
an
animated
conversation
that
is
to
say
i
did
his
part
of
it
was
confined
mostly
to
questions
which
i
was
no
way
loth
to
answer
i
told
him
about
myself
and
my
plans
about
the
old
school
and
about
my
father
whom
i
took
it
for
granted
he
knew
for
was
he
not
the
oldest
teacher
in
the
school
and
the
wisest
as
all
ribe
could
testify
he
listened
to
it
all
with
a
curious
little
smile
and
nodded
in
a
very
pleasant
and
sympathetic
way
which
i
liked
to
see
i
told
him
so
and
that
i
liked
the
people
of
copenhagen
well
they
seemed
so
kind
to
a
stranger
and
he
put
his
hand
on
my
arm
and
patted
it
in
a
friendly
manner
that
was
altogether
nice
so
we
arrived
together
at
the
door
where
the
red
lackey
stood
he
bowed
very
deep
as
we
entered
and
i
bowed
back
and
told
my
friend
that
there
was
an
example
of
it
for
i
had
never
seen
the
man
before
at
which
he
laughed
outright
and
pointing
to
a
door
said
i
would
find
my
brother
in
there
and
bade
me
he
was
gone
before
i
could
shake
hands
with
him
but
just
then
my
brother
came
up
and
i
forgot
about
him
in
my
admiration
of
the
pictures
we
were
resting
in
one
of
the
rooms
an
hour
later
and
i
was
going
over
the
events
of
the
day
telling
all
about
the
kind
stranger
when
in
he
came
and
nodded
smiling
at
me
there
he
is
i
cried
and
nodded
too
to
my
surprise
sophus
got
up
with
a
start
and
salaamed
in
haste
good
gracious
he
said
when
the
stranger
was
gone
you
mean
to
say
he
was
your
guide
why
that
was
the
king
boy
i
was
never
so
astonished
in
my
life
and
expect
never
to
be
again
i
had
only
known
kings
from
hans
christian
andersen
story
books
where
they
always
went
in
coronation
robes
with
long
train
and
pages
and
with
gold
crowns
on
their
heads
that
a
king
could
go
around
in
a
blue
overcoat
like
any
other
man
was
a
real
shock
to
me
that
i
did
get
over
for
a
while
but
when
i
got
to
know
more
of
king
christian
i
liked
him
all
the
better
for
it
you
help
that
anyhow
his
people
call
him
the
good
king
with
cause
he
is
that
speaking
of
hans
christian
andersen
we
boys
loved
him
as
a
matter
of
course
for
had
he
not
told
us
all
the
beautiful
stories
that
made
the
whole
background
of
our
lives
they
do
that
yet
with
me
more
than
you
would
think
the
little
christmas
tree
and
the
hare
that
made
it
weep
by
jumping
over
it
because
it
was
so
small
belong
to
the
things
that
come
to
stay
with
you
always
i
hear
of
people
nowadays
who
think
it
is
not
proper
to
tell
children
i
am
sorry
for
those
children
i
wonder
what
they
will
give
them
instead
algebra
perhaps
nice
lot
of
counting
machines
we
shall
have
running
the
century
that
is
to
come
but
though
we
loved
andersen
we
were
not
above
playing
our
pranks
upon
him
when
occasion
offered
in
those
days
copenhagen
was
girt
about
with
great
earthen
walls
and
there
were
beautiful
walks
up
there
under
the
old
lindens
on
moonlight
nights
when
the
smell
of
violets
was
in
the
air
we
would
sometimes
meet
the
poet
there
walking
alone
then
we
would
string
out
irreverently
in
indian
file
and
walk
up
cap
in
hand
one
after
another
to
salute
him
with
a
deeply
respectful
good
evening
herr
professor
that
was
his
title
his
kind
face
would
beam
with
delight
and
our
proffered
fists
would
be
buried
in
the
very
biggest
hand
it
seemed
to
us
that
mortal
ever
owned
andersen
had
very
large
hands
and
feet
and
we
would
go
away
gleefully
chuckling
and
withal
secretly
ashamed
of
ourselves
he
was
in
such
evident
delight
at
our
homage
they
used
to
tell
a
story
of
andersen
at
the
time
that
made
the
whole
town
laugh
in
its
sleeve
though
there
was
not
a
bit
of
malice
in
it
no
one
had
anything
but
the
sincerest
affection
for
the
poet
in
my
day
his
storm
and
stress
period
was
then
long
past
he
was
it
was
said
greatly
afraid
of
being
buried
alive
so
that
it
might
not
happen
he
carefully
pinned
a
paper
to
his
blanket
every
night
before
he
went
to
sleep
on
which
was
written
i
guess
i
am
only
in
a
trance
footnote
in
danish
jeg
er
vist
skindod
needless
to
say
he
was
in
no
danger
when
he
fell
into
his
long
sleep
the
whole
country
for
that
matter
the
whole
world
stood
weeping
at
his
bier
four
years
i
dreamt
away
in
copenhagen
while
i
learned
my
trade
the
intervals
when
i
was
awake
were
when
she
came
to
the
town
on
a
visit
with
her
father
or
later
to
finish
her
education
at
a
fashionable
school
i
mind
the
first
time
she
came
i
was
at
the
depot
and
i
rode
with
her
on
the
back
of
their
coach
unknown
to
them
so
i
found
out
what
hotel
they
were
to
stay
at
i
called
the
next
day
and
purposely
forgot
my
gloves
heaven
knows
where
i
got
them
from
i
probably
borrowed
them
those
were
not
days
for
gloves
her
father
sent
them
to
my
address
the
next
day
with
a
broad
hint
that
having
been
neighborly
i
need
call
again
he
was
getting
square
for
the
ball
but
my
wife
says
that
i
was
never
good
at
taking
a
hint
except
in
the
way
of
business
as
a
reporter
i
kept
the
run
of
her
all
the
time
she
was
in
the
city
she
did
not
always
see
me
but
i
saw
her
and
that
was
enough
i
watched
her
home
from
school
in
the
evening
and
was
content
though
she
was
escorted
by
a
cadet
with
a
at
his
side
he
was
her
cousin
and
had
given
me
his
word
that
he
cared
nothing
about
her
he
is
a
commodore
and
king
christian
secretary
of
navy
now
when
she
was
sick
i
pledged
my
sunday
trousers
for
a
dollar
and
bought
her
a
bouquet
of
flowers
which
they
teased
her
about
until
she
cried
and
threw
it
away
and
all
the
time
she
was
getting
more
beautiful
and
more
lovable
she
was
certainly
the
handsomest
girl
in
copenhagen
which
is
full
of
charming
women
illustration
down
by
her
garden
on
the
river
nibs
there
were
long
spells
when
she
was
away
and
when
i
dreamt
on
undisturbed
it
was
during
one
of
these
that
i
went
to
the
theatre
with
my
brother
to
see
a
famous
play
in
which
an
assassin
tried
to
murder
the
heroine
who
was
asleep
in
an
armchair
now
this
heroine
was
a
actress
who
looked
singularly
like
elizabeth
as
she
sat
there
with
the
long
curls
sweeping
her
graceful
neck
in
imminent
danger
of
being
killed
i
forgot
where
i
was
what
it
was
all
and
everything
except
that
danger
threatened
elizabeth
and
sprang
to
my
feet
with
a
loud
cry
of
murder
trying
to
make
for
the
stage
my
brother
struggled
to
hold
me
back
there
was
a
sensation
in
the
theatre
and
the
play
was
held
up
while
they
put
me
out
i
remember
king
george
of
greece
eying
me
from
his
box
as
i
was
being
transported
to
the
door
and
the
rascal
murderer
on
the
stage
looking
as
if
he
had
done
something
deserving
of
praise
outside
in
the
cold
my
brother
shook
me
up
and
took
me
home
a
sobered
and
somewhat
crestfallen
lad
but
anyhow
i
do
like
that
kind
of
play
i
do
see
why
the
villain
on
the
stage
is
any
better
than
the
villain
on
the
street
there
are
enough
of
them
and
to
spare
and
think
if
he
killed
her
the
years
passed
and
the
day
came
at
last
when
having
proved
my
fitness
i
received
my
certificate
as
a
duly
enrolled
carpenter
of
the
guild
of
copenhagen
and
dropping
my
tools
joyfully
and
in
haste
made
a
for
ribe
where
she
was
i
thought
that
i
had
moved
with
very
stealthy
steps
toward
my
goal
having
grown
four
years
older
than
at
the
time
i
set
the
whole
community
by
the
ears
but
it
could
not
have
been
so
for
i
had
not
been
hours
in
town
before
it
was
all
over
that
i
had
come
home
to
propose
to
elizabeth
which
was
annoying
but
true
by
the
same
sort
of
sorcery
the
town
knew
in
another
day
that
she
had
refused
me
and
all
the
wise
heads
wagged
and
bore
witness
that
they
could
have
told
me
so
what
did
i
a
common
carpenter
want
at
the
castle
that
was
what
they
called
her
father
house
he
had
other
plans
for
his
pretty
daughter
as
for
elizabeth
poor
child
she
was
not
yet
seventeen
and
was
easily
persuaded
that
it
was
all
wrong
she
wept
and
in
the
goodness
of
her
gentle
heart
was
truly
sorry
and
i
kissed
her
hands
and
went
out
my
eyes
brimming
over
with
tears
feeling
that
there
was
nothing
in
all
the
wide
world
for
me
any
more
and
that
the
farther
i
went
from
her
the
better
so
it
was
settled
that
i
should
go
to
america
her
mother
gave
me
a
picture
of
her
and
a
lock
of
her
hair
and
thereby
roused
the
wrath
of
the
dowagers
once
more
for
why
should
i
be
breaking
my
heart
over
elizabeth
in
foreign
parts
since
she
was
not
for
me
ah
but
mothers
know
better
i
lived
on
that
picture
and
that
curl
six
long
years
illustration
the
picture
her
mother
gave
me
one
may
morning
my
own
mother
went
to
the
stagecoach
with
me
to
see
me
off
on
my
long
journey
father
stayed
home
he
was
ever
a
man
who
with
the
tenderest
of
hearts
put
on
an
appearance
of
great
sternness
lest
he
betray
it
god
rest
his
soul
that
nothing
that
i
have
done
caused
him
greater
grief
in
his
life
than
the
separation
that
day
is
sweet
comfort
to
me
now
he
lived
to
take
elizabeth
to
his
heart
a
beloved
daughter
for
me
i
had
been
that
morning
long
before
the
sun
rose
under
her
window
to
bid
her
but
she
did
not
know
it
the
servants
did
though
and
told
her
of
it
when
she
got
up
and
she
said
well
i
did
ask
him
to
come
but
in
her
secret
soul
i
think
there
was
a
small
regret
that
she
did
not
see
me
go
so
i
went
out
in
the
world
to
seek
my
fortune
the
richer
for
some
which
ribe
friends
had
presented
to
me
knowing
that
i
had
barely
enough
to
pay
my
passage
over
in
the
steerage
though
i
had
aggravated
them
in
a
hundred
ways
and
wholly
disturbed
the
peace
of
the
old
town
i
think
they
liked
me
a
little
anyway
they
were
always
good
kind
neighbors
honest
and
lovable
folk
i
looked
back
with
my
mother
blessing
yet
in
my
ears
to
where
the
gilt
glistened
on
her
father
house
and
the
tears
brimmed
over
again
and
yet
such
is
life
presently
i
felt
my
heart
bound
with
a
new
courage
all
was
not
lost
yet
the
world
was
before
me
but
yesterday
the
chance
befell
that
in
going
to
communion
in
the
old
domkirke
i
knelt
beside
her
at
the
altar
rail
i
thought
of
that
and
dried
my
eyes
god
is
good
he
did
not
lay
it
up
against
me
when
next
we
met
there
we
knelt
to
be
made
man
and
wife
for
better
or
worse
blessedly
gloriously
for
better
forever
and
aye
and
all
our
troubles
were
over
for
had
we
not
one
another
chapter
ii
i
land
in
new
york
and
take
a
hand
in
the
game
the
steamer
from
glasgow
made
port
after
a
long
and
stormy
voyage
on
whitsunday
she
had
come
up
during
the
night
and
cast
anchor
off
castle
garden
it
was
a
beautiful
spring
morning
and
as
i
looked
over
the
rail
at
the
miles
of
straight
streets
the
green
heights
of
brooklyn
and
the
stir
of
ferryboats
and
pleasure
craft
on
the
river
my
hopes
rose
high
that
somewhere
in
this
teeming
hive
there
would
be
a
place
for
me
what
kind
of
a
place
i
had
myself
no
clear
notion
of
i
would
let
that
work
out
as
it
could
of
course
i
had
my
trade
to
fall
back
on
but
i
am
afraid
that
is
all
the
use
i
thought
of
putting
it
to
the
love
of
change
belongs
to
youth
and
i
meant
to
take
a
hand
in
things
as
they
came
along
i
had
a
pair
of
strong
hands
and
stubbornness
enough
to
do
for
two
also
a
strong
belief
that
in
a
free
country
free
from
the
dominion
of
custom
of
caste
as
well
as
of
men
things
would
somehow
come
right
in
the
end
and
a
man
get
shaken
into
the
corner
where
he
belonged
if
he
took
a
hand
in
the
game
i
think
i
was
right
in
that
if
it
took
a
lot
of
shaking
to
get
me
where
i
belonged
that
was
just
what
i
needed
even
my
mother
admits
that
now
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
tired
of
hammer
and
saw
they
were
indissolubly
bound
up
with
my
dreams
of
elizabeth
that
were
now
gone
to
smash
therefore
i
hated
them
and
straightway
remembering
that
the
day
was
her
birthday
and
accepting
the
fact
as
a
good
omen
i
rebuilt
my
and
resolved
to
try
on
a
new
tack
so
irrational
is
human
nature
at
when
in
love
and
is
it
good
that
it
is
in
all
of
which
i
have
made
no
account
of
a
factor
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
half
our
troubles
with
our
immigrant
population
so
far
as
they
are
not
of
our
own
making
the
loss
of
reckoning
that
follows
uprooting
the
cutting
loose
from
all
sense
of
responsibility
with
the
old
standards
gone
that
makes
the
politician
job
so
profitable
in
our
large
cities
and
that
of
the
patriot
and
the
housekeeper
so
wearisome
we
all
know
the
process
the
immigrant
has
no
patent
on
it
it
afflicts
the
native
too
when
he
goes
to
a
town
where
he
is
not
known
in
the
slum
it
reaches
its
climax
in
the
second
generation
and
makes
of
the
irishman
and
the
boys
the
toughs
who
fight
the
battles
of
hell
kitchen
and
frog
hollow
it
simply
means
that
we
are
creatures
of
environment
that
a
man
everywhere
is
largely
what
his
neighbors
and
his
children
think
him
to
be
and
that
government
makes
for
our
moral
good
too
dreamers
and
anarchists
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
but
simple
as
it
is
it
has
been
too
long
neglected
for
the
safety
of
the
man
and
of
the
state
i
am
not
going
to
discuss
here
plans
for
mending
this
neglect
but
i
can
think
of
three
that
would
work
one
of
them
does
work
if
not
up
to
the
top
notch
the
public
school
in
its
ultimate
development
as
the
neighborhood
centre
of
things
i
would
have
that
the
first
care
of
city
government
always
and
everywhere
at
whatever
expense
an
efficient
parish
districting
is
another
i
think
we
are
coming
to
that
the
last
is
a
rigid
annual
enrolment
the
school
census
is
good
but
not
good
enough
for
vaccination
purposes
jury
duty
for
military
purposes
if
you
please
i
do
not
mean
for
conscription
but
for
the
ascertainment
of
the
fighting
strength
of
the
state
in
case
of
need
for
anything
that
would
serve
as
an
excuse
it
is
the
enrolment
itself
that
i
think
would
have
a
good
effect
in
making
the
man
feel
that
he
is
counted
on
for
something
that
he
belongs
as
it
were
instead
of
standing
idle
and
watching
a
procession
go
by
in
which
there
is
no
place
for
him
which
is
only
another
way
of
saying
that
it
is
his
right
to
harass
it
and
levy
tribute
as
he
can
the
enrolment
for
voting
comes
too
late
by
that
time
he
may
have
joined
the
looters
army
so
as
properly
to
take
my
own
place
in
the
procession
if
not
in
the
army
referred
to
as
i
conceived
the
custom
of
the
country
to
be
i
made
it
my
first
business
to
buy
a
navy
revolver
of
the
largest
size
investing
in
the
purchase
exactly
of
my
capital
i
strapped
the
weapon
on
the
outside
of
my
coat
and
strode
up
broadway
conscious
that
i
was
following
the
fashion
of
the
country
i
knew
it
upon
the
authority
of
a
man
who
had
been
there
before
me
and
had
returned
a
gold
digger
in
the
early
days
of
california
but
america
was
america
to
us
we
knew
no
distinction
of
west
and
east
by
rights
there
ought
to
have
been
buffaloes
and
red
indians
charging
up
and
down
broadway
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
it
is
easier
even
to
make
lots
of
people
over
there
believe
that
than
that
new
york
is
paved
and
lighted
with
electric
lights
and
quite
as
civilized
as
copenhagen
they
will
have
it
that
it
is
in
the
wilds
i
saw
none
of
the
signs
of
this
but
i
encountered
a
friendly
policeman
who
sizing
me
and
my
pistol
up
tapped
it
gently
with
his
club
and
advised
me
to
leave
it
home
or
i
might
get
robbed
of
it
this
at
first
blush
seemed
to
confirm
my
apprehensions
but
he
was
a
very
nice
policeman
and
took
time
to
explain
seeing
that
i
was
very
green
and
i
took
his
advice
and
put
the
revolver
away
secretly
relieved
to
get
rid
of
it
it
was
quite
heavy
to
carry
around
i
had
letters
to
the
danish
consul
and
to
the
president
of
the
american
banknote
company
goodall
i
think
perhaps
he
was
not
then
the
president
but
became
so
afterward
goodall
had
once
been
wrecked
on
the
danish
coast
and
rescued
by
the
captain
of
the
lifesaving
crew
a
friend
of
my
family
but
they
were
both
in
europe
and
in
just
four
days
i
realized
that
there
was
no
special
public
clamor
for
my
services
in
new
york
and
decided
to
go
west
a
missionary
in
castle
garden
was
getting
up
a
gang
of
men
for
the
brady
bend
iron
works
on
the
allegheny
river
and
i
went
along
we
started
a
full
score
with
tickets
paid
but
only
two
of
us
reached
the
bend
the
rest
calmly
deserted
in
pittsburg
and
went
their
own
way
now
here
was
an
instance
of
what
i
have
just
been
saying
not
one
of
them
probably
would
have
thought
of
doing
it
on
the
other
side
they
would
have
carried
out
their
contract
as
a
matter
of
course
here
they
broke
it
as
a
matter
of
course
the
minute
it
did
suit
them
to
go
on
two
of
them
had
been
on
our
steamer
and
the
thought
of
them
makes
me
laugh
even
now
one
was
a
dane
who
carried
an
immense
knapsack
that
was
filled
with
sausages
cheese
and
grub
of
all
kinds
when
he
came
aboard
he
never
let
go
of
it
for
a
moment
on
the
voyage
in
storm
and
sunshine
he
was
there
shouldering
his
knapsack
i
think
he
slept
with
it
when
i
last
saw
him
hobbling
down
a
side
street
in
pittsburg
he
carried
it
still
but
one
end
of
it
hung
limp
and
hungry
and
the
other
was
as
lean
as
a
bad
year
the
other
voyager
was
a
jovial
swede
whose
sole
baggage
consisted
of
an
old
musket
a
blackthorn
stick
and
a
barometer
glass
tied
up
together
the
glass
he
explained
was
worth
keeping
it
might
some
day
make
an
elegant
ruler
the
fellow
was
a
blacksmith
and
i
mistrust
that
he
could
not
write
adler
and
i
went
on
to
brady
bend
adler
was
a
big
explosive
german
who
had
been
a
reserve
officer
i
think
in
the
prussian
army
fate
had
linked
us
together
when
on
the
steamer
the
meat
served
in
the
steerage
became
so
bad
as
to
offend
not
only
our
palates
but
our
sense
of
smell
we
got
up
a
demonstration
marching
to
see
the
captain
in
a
body
adler
and
i
carrying
a
tray
of
the
objectionable
meat
between
us
as
the
spokesman
i
presented
the
case
briefly
and
respectfully
and
all
would
have
gone
well
had
not
the
hot
blood
of
adler
risen
at
the
wrong
moment
when
the
captain
was
cautiously
exploring
the
scent
of
the
rejected
food
with
a
sudden
upward
jerk
he
caused
that
official
nose
to
disappear
momentarily
in
the
dish
while
he
exploded
in
voluble
german
the
result
was
an
instant
rupture
of
diplomatic
relations
adler
was
put
in
the
but
set
fiee
again
immediately
he
spent
the
rest
of
the
voyage
in
his
bunk
shouting
dire
threats
of
disaster
impending
from
the
norddeutsche
consul
once
he
reached
new
york
but
we
were
all
too
glad
to
get
ashore
to
think
of
vengeance
then
illustration
brady
bend
as
i
knew
it
adler
found
work
at
the
while
i
was
set
to
building
huts
for
the
miners
on
the
east
bank
of
the
river
where
a
clearing
had
been
made
and
called
east
brady
on
the
other
side
of
the
allegheny
the
furnaces
and
rolling
mills
were
hidden
away
in
a
narrow
winding
valley
that
set
back
into
the
hills
growing
deeper
and
narrower
with
every
mile
it
was
to
me
who
had
been
used
to
seeing
the
sun
rise
and
set
over
a
level
plain
where
the
winds
of
heaven
blew
as
they
listed
from
the
first
like
a
prison
i
climbed
the
hills
only
to
find
that
there
were
bigger
hills
beyond
an
endless
sea
of
swelling
billows
of
green
without
a
clearing
in
it
i
spent
all
sunday
roaming
through
it
miles
and
miles
to
find
an
outlook
from
which
i
might
see
the
end
but
there
was
none
a
horrible
fit
of
homesickness
came
upon
me
the
days
i
managed
to
get
through
by
working
hard
and
making
observations
on
the
american
language
in
this
i
had
a
volunteer
assistant
in
julia
the
pretty
barefooted
daughter
of
a
who
hung
around
and
took
an
interest
in
what
was
going
on
but
she
disappeared
after
i
had
asked
her
to
explain
what
setting
one
cap
for
any
one
meant
i
was
curious
because
i
had
heard
her
mother
say
to
a
neighbor
that
julia
was
doing
that
to
me
but
the
evenings
were
very
lonesome
the
girl
in
our
washed
dishes
always
to
one
tune
the
letter
that
never
came
it
was
not
a
cheerful
tune
and
not
a
cheerful
subject
for
i
had
had
no
news
from
home
since
i
left
i
can
hear
her
yet
shrieking
and
clattering
her
dishes
with
the
frogs
yelling
accompaniment
in
the
creek
that
mumbled
in
the
valley
i
never
could
abide
american
frogs
since
there
is
rest
in
the
of
its
european
brother
but
the
breathless
yi
yi
of
our
american
frogs
makes
me
feel
always
as
if
i
wanted
to
die
which
i
do
in
making
the
clearing
i
first
saw
an
american
swing
an
axe
and
the
sight
filled
me
with
admiration
for
the
man
and
the
axe
both
it
was
a
and
he
a
typical
and
backwoodsman
i
also
had
learned
to
use
the
axe
but
anything
like
the
way
he
swung
it
first
over
one
then
over
the
other
shoulder
making
it
tell
in
long
clean
cuts
at
every
blow
i
had
never
dreamt
of
it
was
splendid
i
wished
myself
back
in
copenhagen
just
long
enough
to
tell
the
numskulls
there
who
were
distrustful
of
american
tools
which
were
just
beginning
to
come
into
the
market
that
they
did
know
what
they
were
talking
about
of
course
it
was
reasonable
that
the
good
tools
should
come
from
the
country
where
they
had
good
use
for
them
there
was
a
settlement
of
honest
welshmen
in
the
back
hills
and
the
rumor
that
a
dane
had
come
into
the
valley
reached
it
in
due
course
it
brought
down
a
company
of
four
sturdy
miners
who
trudged
five
miles
over
bad
land
of
a
sunday
to
see
what
i
was
like
the
danes
who
live
in
welsh
song
and
story
must
have
been
grievous
giants
for
they
were
greatly
disgusted
at
sight
of
me
and
spoke
their
minds
about
it
without
reserve
even
with
some
severity
as
if
i
were
guilty
of
some
sort
of
an
imposition
on
the
valley
it
could
hardly
have
been
this
introduction
that
tempted
me
to
try
i
have
forgotten
how
it
came
about
probably
through
some
temporary
slackness
in
the
building
trade
but
i
did
try
and
one
day
was
enough
for
me
the
company
mined
its
own
coal
such
as
it
was
it
cropped
out
of
the
hills
right
and
left
in
narrow
veins
sometimes
too
shallow
to
work
seldom
affording
more
space
to
the
digger
than
barely
enough
to
permit
him
to
stand
upright
you
did
not
go
down
through
a
shaft
but
straight
in
through
the
side
of
a
hill
to
the
bowels
of
the
mountain
following
a
track
on
which
a
little
donkey
drew
the
coal
to
the
mouth
of
the
mine
and
sent
it
down
the
incline
to
run
up
and
down
a
hill
a
mile
or
more
by
its
own
gravity
before
it
reached
the
place
of
unloading
through
one
of
these
we
marched
in
adler
and
i
one
summer
morning
with
new
pickaxes
on
our
shoulders
and
nasty
little
oil
lamps
fixed
in
our
hats
to
light
us
through
the
darkness
where
every
second
we
stumbled
over
chunks
of
slate
rock
or
into
pools
of
water
that
oozed
through
from
above
an
old
miner
whose
way
lay
past
the
fork
in
the
tunnel
where
our
lead
began
showed
us
how
to
use
our
picks
and
the
timbers
to
brace
the
slate
that
roofed
over
the
vein
and
left
us
to
ourselves
in
a
chamber
perhaps
ten
feet
wide
and
the
height
of
a
man
we
were
to
be
paid
by
the
ton
i
forget
how
much
but
it
was
very
little
and
we
lost
no
time
getting
to
work
we
had
to
dig
away
the
coal
at
the
floor
with
our
picks
lying
on
our
knees
to
do
it
and
afterward
drive
wedges
under
the
roof
to
loosen
the
mass
it
was
hard
work
and
entirely
inexperienced
as
we
were
we
made
but
little
headway
as
the
day
wore
on
the
darkness
and
silence
grew
very
oppressive
and
made
us
start
nervously
at
the
least
thing
the
sudden
arrival
of
our
donkey
with
its
cart
gave
me
a
dreadful
fright
the
friendly
beast
greeted
us
with
a
joyous
bray
and
rubbed
its
shaggy
sides
against
us
in
the
most
companionable
way
in
the
flickering
light
of
my
lamp
i
caught
sight
of
its
long
ears
waving
over
me
i
do
believe
i
had
seen
three
donkeys
before
in
my
life
there
were
none
where
i
came
from
and
heard
that
demoniac
shriek
and
i
verily
believe
i
thought
the
evil
one
had
come
for
me
in
person
i
know
that
i
nearly
fainted
that
donkey
was
a
discerning
animal
i
think
it
knew
when
it
first
set
eyes
on
us
that
we
were
not
going
to
overwork
it
and
we
did
when
toward
evening
we
quit
work
after
narrowly
escaping
being
killed
by
a
large
stone
that
fell
from
the
roof
in
consequence
of
our
neglect
to
brace
it
up
properly
our
united
efforts
had
resulted
in
barely
filling
two
of
the
little
carts
and
we
had
earned
if
i
recollect
aright
something
like
sixty
cents
each
the
fall
of
the
roof
robbed
us
of
all
desire
to
try
mining
again
it
knocked
the
lamps
from
our
hats
and
in
darkness
that
could
almost
be
felt
we
groped
our
way
back
to
the
light
along
the
track
getting
more
badly
frightened
as
we
went
the
last
stretch
of
way
we
ran
holding
each
other
hands
as
though
we
were
not
men
and
miners
but
two
frightened
children
in
the
dark
as
we
emerged
from
the
damp
gap
in
the
mountain
side
the
sunset
was
upon
the
hills
peaceful
sounds
came
up
from
the
valley
where
the
shadows
lay
deep
gangs
of
men
were
going
home
from
the
toil
to
their
evening
rest
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
been
dead
and
had
come
back
to
life
the
world
was
never
so
wondrous
fair
my
companion
stood
looking
out
over
the
landscape
with
hungry
eyes
neither
of
us
spoke
but
when
the
last
gleam
had
died
out
in
the
window
of
the
stone
church
we
went
straight
to
the
company
store
and
gave
up
our
picks
i
have
never
set
foot
in
a
coal
mine
since
and
have
not
the
least
desire
to
do
so
i
was
back
in
the
harness
of
the
when
in
the
middle
of
july
the
news
struck
down
in
our
quiet
community
like
a
bombshell
that
france
had
declared
war
on
prussia
also
that
denmark
was
expected
to
join
her
forces
to
those
of
her
old
ally
and
take
revenge
for
the
great
robbery
of
i
dropped
my
tools
the
moment
i
heard
it
and
flew
rather
than
ran
to
the
office
to
demand
my
time
thence
to
our
to
pack
adler
reasoned
and
entreated
called
it
an
insane
notion
but
when
he
saw
that
nothing
would
stop
me
lent
a
hand
in
stuffing
my
trunk
praying
pathetically
between
pulls
that
his
countrymen
would
make
short
work
of
me
as
they
certainly
would
of
france
i
heeded
nothing
all
the
hot
blood
of
youth
was
surging
through
me
i
remembered
the
defeat
the
humiliation
of
the
flag
i
loved
aye
and
love
yet
for
there
is
no
flag
like
the
flag
of
my
fathers
save
only
that
of
my
children
and
of
my
manhood
and
i
remembered
too
elizabeth
with
a
sudden
hope
i
would
be
near
her
then
and
i
would
earn
fame
and
glory
the
carpenter
would
come
back
with
perhaps
then
in
the
castle
i
shouldered
my
trunk
and
ran
for
the
station
such
tools
clothes
and
things
as
it
would
not
hold
i
sold
for
what
they
would
fetch
and
boarded
the
next
train
for
buffalo
which
was
as
far
as
my
money
would
take
me
illustration
i
found
the
valley
deserted
and
dead
i
can
not
resist
the
temptation
at
this
point
to
carry
the
story
thirty
years
forward
to
last
winter
in
order
to
point
out
one
of
the
queer
happenings
which
long
ago
caused
me
to
be
known
to
my
friends
as
the
man
of
coincidences
i
have
long
since
ceased
to
consider
them
as
such
though
in
this
one
there
is
no
other
present
significance
than
that
it
decided
a
point
which
i
had
been
turning
over
in
my
own
mind
of
moment
to
me
and
my
publisher
i
was
lecturing
in
pittsburg
at
the
time
and
ran
up
to
take
another
look
at
brady
bend
i
found
the
valley
deserted
and
dead
the
mills
were
gone
disaster
had
overtaken
them
in
the
panic
of
and
all
that
remained
of
the
huge
plant
was
a
tottering
stump
of
the
chimney
and
clusters
of
vacant
houses
dropping
to
pieces
here
and
there
young
trees
grew
out
of
the
cold
ashes
in
the
all
about
was
desolation
strolling
down
by
the
river
with
the
editor
of
the
local
paper
in
east
brady
which
had
grown
into
a
slow
little
railroad
town
my
eye
fell
upon
a
wrecked
hut
in
which
i
recognized
the
company
office
the
shutters
were
gone
the
door
hung
on
one
hinge
and
the
stairs
had
rotted
away
but
we
climbed
in
somehow
it
was
an
idle
quest
said
my
companion
all
the
books
and
papers
had
been
sold
the
summer
before
to
a
pittsburg
junkman
who
came
with
a
cart
and
pitchforked
them
into
it
as
so
much
waste
paper
his
trail
was
plain
within
the
floor
was
littered
with
torn
maps
and
newspapers
from
the
second
term
of
president
grant
in
a
rubbish
heap
i
kicked
against
something
more
solid
and
picked
it
up
it
was
the
only
book
left
in
the
place
the
for
the
years
and
almost
the
first
name
i
read
was
my
own
as
having
received
on
july
in
settlement
of
my
account
with
the
brady
bend
company
when
i
started
for
the
war
my
companion
stared
i
wrapped
up
the
book
and
took
it
away
with
me
i
considered
that
i
had
a
moral
right
to
it
but
if
anybody
questions
it
it
is
at
his
service
buffalo
was
full
of
frenchmen
but
they
did
not
receive
me
with
a
torchlight
procession
they
even
shrugged
their
shoulders
when
good
old
pater
bretton
took
up
my
cause
and
tried
to
get
me
forwarded
at
least
to
new
york
the
one
patriot
i
found
to
applaud
my
high
resolve
was
a
french
pawnbroker
who
with
many
compliments
and
shoulder
pattings
took
my
trunk
and
all
its
contents
after
i
had
paid
my
board
out
of
it
in
exchange
for
a
ticket
to
new
york
he
took
my
watch
too
but
that
did
keep
time
i
remember
seeing
my
brush
go
with
a
grim
smile
having
no
clothes
to
brush
i
had
no
need
of
it
any
longer
that
pawnbroker
was
an
artist
the
year
after
when
i
was
in
buffalo
again
it
occurred
to
me
to
go
in
and
see
if
i
could
get
back
any
of
my
belongings
i
was
just
a
bit
ashamed
of
myself
and
represented
that
i
was
a
brother
of
the
young
hothead
who
had
gone
to
the
war
i
thought
i
discovered
a
pair
of
trousers
that
had
been
mine
hanging
up
in
his
store
but
the
frenchman
was
quicker
than
i
his
eyes
followed
mine
and
he
took
instant
umbrage
so
your
brother
vas
one
shump
vas
he
he
yelled
your
brother
vas
a
long
sight
better
man
zan
you
mine
frient
he
go
fight
for
la
france
you
stay
here
get
out
and
he
put
me
out
and
saved
the
day
and
the
trousers
it
was
never
a
good
plan
for
me
to
lie
it
never
did
work
out
right
not
once
i
have
found
the
only
safe
plan
to
be
to
stick
to
the
truth
and
let
the
house
come
down
if
it
must
it
will
come
down
anyhow
i
reached
new
york
with
just
one
cent
in
my
pocket
and
put
up
at
a
where
the
charge
was
one
dollar
a
day
in
this
no
moral
obliquity
was
involved
i
had
simply
reached
the
goal
for
which
i
had
sacrificed
all
and
felt
sure
that
the
french
people
or
the
danish
consul
would
do
the
rest
quickly
but
there
was
evidently
something
wrong
somewhere
the
danish
consul
could
only
register
my
demand
to
be
returned
to
denmark
in
the
event
of
war
they
have
my
letter
at
the
office
yet
he
tells
me
and
they
will
call
me
out
with
the
reserves
the
french
were
fitting
out
no
volunteer
army
that
i
could
get
on
the
track
of
and
nobody
was
paying
the
passage
of
fighting
men
the
end
of
it
was
that
after
pawning
my
revolver
and
my
the
only
valuable
possessions
i
had
left
to
pay
for
my
lodging
i
was
thrown
on
the
street
and
told
to
come
back
when
i
had
more
money
that
night
i
wandered
about
new
york
with
a
gripsack
that
had
only
a
linen
duster
and
a
pair
of
socks
in
it
turning
over
in
my
mind
what
to
do
next
toward
midnight
i
passed
a
house
in
clinton
place
that
was
lighted
up
festively
laughter
and
the
hum
of
many
voices
came
from
within
i
listened
they
spoke
french
a
society
of
frenchmen
having
their
annual
dinner
the
watchman
in
the
block
told
me
there
at
last
was
my
chance
i
went
up
the
steps
and
rang
the
bell
a
flunkey
in
a
opened
but
when
he
saw
that
i
was
not
a
guest
but
to
all
appearances
a
tramp
he
tried
to
put
me
out
i
on
my
part
tried
to
explain
there
was
an
altercation
and
two
gentlemen
of
the
society
appeared
they
listened
impatiently
to
what
i
had
to
say
then
without
a
word
thrust
me
into
the
street
and
slammed
the
door
in
my
face
it
was
too
much
inwardly
raging
i
shook
the
dust
of
the
city
from
my
feet
and
took
the
most
direct
route
out
of
it
straight
up
third
avenue
i
walked
till
the
stars
in
the
east
began
to
pale
and
then
climbed
into
a
wagon
that
stood
at
the
curb
to
sleep
i
did
not
notice
that
it
was
a
the
sun
had
not
risen
yet
when
the
driver
came
unceremoniously
dragged
me
out
by
the
feet
and
dumped
me
into
the
gutter
on
i
went
with
my
gripsack
straight
ahead
until
toward
noon
i
reached
fordham
college
famished
and
footsore
i
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
previous
day
and
had
vainly
tried
to
make
a
bath
in
the
bronx
river
do
for
breakfast
not
yet
could
i
cheat
my
stomach
that
way
the
college
gates
were
open
and
i
strolled
wearily
in
without
aim
or
purpose
on
a
lawn
some
young
men
were
engaged
in
athletic
exercises
and
i
stopped
to
look
and
admire
the
beautiful
and
the
imposing
building
so
at
least
it
seems
to
me
at
this
distance
an
old
monk
in
a
cowl
whose
noble
face
i
sometimes
recall
in
my
dreams
came
over
and
asked
kindly
if
i
was
not
hungry
i
was
in
all
conscience
fearfully
hungry
and
i
said
so
though
i
did
not
mean
to
i
had
never
seen
a
real
live
monk
before
and
my
lutheran
training
had
not
exactly
inclined
me
in
their
favor
i
ate
of
the
food
set
before
me
not
without
qualms
of
conscience
and
with
a
secret
suspicion
that
i
would
next
be
asked
to
abjure
my
faith
or
at
least
do
homage
to
the
virgin
mary
which
i
was
firmly
resolved
not
to
do
but
when
the
meal
finished
i
was
sent
on
my
way
with
enough
to
do
me
for
supper
without
the
least
allusion
having
been
made
to
my
soul
i
felt
heartily
ashamed
of
myself
i
am
just
as
good
a
protestant
as
i
ever
was
among
my
own
i
am
a
kind
of
heretic
even
because
i
can
not
put
up
with
the
apostolic
succession
but
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
excellent
charities
of
the
roman
church
or
with
the
noble
spirit
that
animates
them
i
learned
that
lesson
at
fordham
thirty
years
ago
up
the
railroad
track
i
went
and
at
night
hired
out
to
a
with
the
freedom
of
his
haymow
for
my
sleeping
quarters
but
when
i
had
hoed
cucumbers
three
days
in
a
scorching
sun
till
my
back
ached
as
if
it
were
going
to
break
and
the
farmer
guessed
that
he
would
call
it
square
for
three
shillings
i
went
farther
a
man
is
not
necessarily
a
philanthropist
it
seems
because
he
tills
the
soil
i
did
not
hire
out
again
i
did
odd
jobs
to
earn
my
meals
and
slept
in
the
fields
at
night
still
turning
over
in
my
mind
how
to
get
across
the
sea
an
incident
of
those
wanderings
comes
to
mind
while
i
am
writing
they
were
carting
in
hay
and
when
night
came
on
somewhere
about
mount
vernon
i
gathered
an
armful
of
wisps
that
had
fallen
from
the
loads
and
made
a
bed
for
myself
in
a
by
the
roadside
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
was
awakened
by
a
loud
outcry
a
fierce
light
shone
in
my
face
it
was
the
lamp
of
a
carriage
that
had
been
driven
into
the
shed
i
was
lying
between
the
horse
feet
unhurt
a
gentleman
sprang
from
the
carriage
more
frightened
than
i
and
bent
over
me
when
he
found
that
i
had
suffered
no
injury
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
held
out
a
silver
quarter
go
he
said
and
drink
it
up
drink
it
up
yourself
i
shouted
angrily
what
do
you
take
me
for
they
were
rather
high
heroics
seeing
where
i
was
but
he
saw
nothing
to
laugh
at
he
looked
earnestly
at
me
for
a
moment
then
held
out
his
hand
and
shook
mine
heartily
i
believe
you
he
said
yet
you
need
it
or
you
would
not
sleep
here
now
will
you
take
it
from
me
and
i
took
the
money
the
next
day
it
rained
and
the
next
day
after
that
and
i
footed
it
back
to
the
city
still
on
my
vain
quest
a
quarter
is
not
a
great
capital
to
subsist
on
in
new
york
when
one
is
not
a
beggar
and
has
no
friends
two
days
of
it
drove
me
out
again
to
find
at
least
the
food
to
keep
me
alive
but
in
those
two
days
i
met
the
man
who
long
years
after
was
to
be
my
honored
chief
charles
dana
the
editor
of
the
sun
there
had
been
an
item
in
the
sun
about
a
volunteer
regiment
being
fitted
out
for
france
i
went
up
to
the
office
and
was
admitted
to
dana
presence
i
fancy
i
must
have
appealed
to
his
sense
of
the
ludicrous
dressed
in
and
a
linen
duster
much
the
worse
for
wear
and
demanding
to
be
sent
out
to
fight
he
knew
nothing
about
recruiting
was
i
french
no
danish
it
had
been
in
his
paper
about
the
regiment
he
smiled
a
little
at
my
faith
and
said
editors
sometimes
did
not
know
about
everything
that
was
in
their
papers
i
turned
to
go
grievously
disappointed
but
he
called
me
back
have
you
he
said
looking
searchingly
at
me
have
you
had
your
breakfast
no
god
knows
that
i
had
not
neither
that
day
nor
for
many
days
before
that
was
one
of
the
things
i
had
at
last
learned
to
consider
among
the
superfluities
of
an
effete
civilization
i
suppose
i
had
no
need
of
telling
it
to
him
for
it
was
plain
to
read
in
my
face
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
dollar
there
he
said
go
and
get
your
breakfast
and
better
give
up
the
war
give
up
the
war
and
for
a
breakfast
i
spurned
the
dollar
hotly
i
came
here
to
enlist
not
to
beg
money
for
breakfast
i
said
and
strode
out
of
the
office
my
head
in
the
air
but
my
stomach
crying
out
miserably
in
rebellion
against
my
pride
i
revenged
myself
upon
it
by
leaving
my
with
the
uncle
who
was
my
only
friend
and
relative
here
and
filling
my
stomach
upon
the
proceeds
i
had
one
good
dinner
anyhow
for
when
i
got
through
there
was
only
cents
left
of
the
dollar
i
borrowed
upon
my
last
article
of
dress
that
i
paid
for
a
ticket
to
perth
amboy
near
which
place
i
found
work
in
pfeiffer
pfeiffer
was
a
german
but
his
wife
was
irish
and
so
were
his
hands
all
except
a
giant
norwegian
and
myself
the
third
day
was
sunday
and
was
devoted
to
drinking
much
beer
which
pfeiffer
with
an
eye
to
business
furnished
on
the
premises
when
they
were
drunk
the
tribe
turned
upon
the
norwegian
and
threw
him
out
it
seems
that
this
was
a
regular
weekly
occurrence
me
they
fired
out
at
the
same
time
but
afterward
paid
no
attention
to
me
the
whole
crew
of
them
perched
on
the
norwegian
and
belabored
him
with
broomsticks
and
until
they
roused
the
sleeping
berserk
in
him
as
i
was
coming
to
his
relief
i
saw
the
human
heap
heave
and
rock
from
under
it
arose
the
enraged
giant
tossed
his
tormentors
aside
as
if
they
were
so
much
chaff
battered
down
the
door
of
the
house
in
which
they
took
refuge
and
threw
them
all
pfeiffer
included
through
the
window
they
were
not
hurt
and
within
two
hours
they
were
drinking
more
beer
together
and
swearing
at
one
another
endearingly
i
concluded
that
i
had
better
go
on
though
pfeiffer
regretted
that
he
never
paid
his
hands
in
the
middle
of
the
month
it
appeared
afterward
that
he
objected
likewise
to
paying
them
at
the
end
of
the
month
or
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
he
owes
me
two
days
wages
yet
chapter
iii
i
go
to
war
at
last
and
sow
the
seed
of
future
campaigns
at
sunset
on
the
second
day
after
my
desertion
of
pfeiffer
i
walked
across
a
footbridge
into
a
city
with
many
spires
in
one
of
which
a
chime
of
bells
rang
out
a
familiar
tune
the
city
was
new
brunswick
i
turned
down
a
side
street
where
two
stone
churches
stood
side
by
side
a
gate
in
the
picket
fence
had
been
left
open
and
i
went
in
looking
for
a
place
to
sleep
back
in
the
churchyard
i
found
what
i
sought
in
the
brownstone
slab
covering
the
tomb
of
i
know
now
an
old
pastor
of
the
dutch
reformed
church
who
died
full
of
wisdom
and
grace
i
am
afraid
that
i
was
not
overburdened
with
either
or
i
might
have
gone
to
bed
with
a
full
stomach
too
instead
of
chewing
the
last
of
the
windfall
apples
that
had
been
my
diet
on
my
two
days
trip
but
if
he
slept
as
peacefully
under
the
slab
as
i
slept
on
it
he
was
doing
well
i
had
for
once
a
dry
bed
and
brownstone
keeps
warm
long
after
the
sun
has
set
the
night
dews
and
the
snakes
and
the
dogs
that
kept
sniffing
and
growling
half
the
night
in
the
near
distance
had
made
me
tired
of
sleeping
in
the
fields
the
dead
were
much
better
company
they
minded
their
own
business
and
let
a
fellow
alone
illustration
the
dead
were
much
better
company
before
i
was
on
the
looking
for
a
job
mules
were
in
demand
there
not
men
the
drift
caught
me
once
more
and
toward
evening
cast
me
up
at
a
country
town
then
called
little
washington
now
south
river
how
i
got
there
i
do
not
now
remember
my
diary
from
those
days
says
nothing
about
it
years
after
i
went
back
over
that
road
and
accepted
a
lift
from
a
farmer
going
my
way
we
passed
through
a
and
i
wondered
how
the
keeper
came
to
collect
uneven
money
we
were
two
men
and
two
horses
when
i
came
back
the
day
after
i
found
out
so
many
cents
read
the
sign
that
swung
from
the
gate
for
team
and
driver
so
many
for
each
additional
beast
i
had
gone
through
as
an
additional
beast
a
short
walk
from
little
washington
i
found
work
in
at
a
month
and
board
that
night
when
i
turned
in
after
a
square
meal
in
an
old
wagon
i
had
begged
for
a
bed
i
felt
like
a
capitalist
i
took
to
the
wagon
because
one
look
within
the
barracks
had
shown
them
to
be
impossible
whether
it
was
that
or
the
fact
that
most
of
the
other
hands
were
germans
who
felt
in
duty
bound
to
celebrate
each
victory
over
the
french
as
it
was
reported
day
by
day
and
so
provoked
me
to
wrath
from
the
first
we
get
on
they
made
a
point
whenever
they
came
back
from
their
celebrations
in
the
village
of
dragging
my
wagon
with
me
fast
asleep
in
it
down
into
the
river
where
by
and
by
the
tide
rose
and
searched
me
out
then
i
had
to
swim
for
it
that
was
of
less
account
our
costume
was
not
elaborate
a
pair
of
overalls
a
woollen
shirt
and
a
straw
hat
that
was
all
and
a
wetting
was
rather
welcome
than
otherwise
but
they
dubbed
me
bismarck
and
that
was
not
to
be
borne
my
passionate
protest
only
made
them
laugh
the
louder
yet
they
were
not
an
lot
rather
the
reverse
saturday
afternoon
was
our
when
we
all
sported
together
in
peace
and
harmony
in
the
river
when
we
came
out
we
spread
our
clothes
to
dry
on
the
roof
of
the
barracks
while
we
burrowed
each
in
a
hill
of
white
sand
and
smoked
our
pipes
far
into
the
night
with
only
our
heads
and
the
hand
that
held
the
pipe
sticking
out
that
was
for
protection
against
mosquitoes
it
must
have
been
a
sight
one
of
those
saturday
night
confabs
but
it
was
solid
comfort
after
the
wreek
work
bricks
are
made
literally
while
the
sun
shines
the
day
begins
with
the
first
glimmer
of
light
in
the
east
and
is
not
over
till
the
pits
are
worked
out
it
was
my
task
to
cart
clay
in
the
afternoon
to
fill
them
up
again
it
was
an
idle
enough
kind
of
job
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
walk
alongside
my
horse
a
big
white
beast
with
no
joints
at
all
except
where
its
legs
were
hinged
to
the
backbone
back
it
up
to
the
pit
and
dump
the
load
but
walking
so
in
the
autumn
sun
i
fell
i
forgot
claybank
and
pit
i
was
back
in
the
old
town
saw
her
play
among
the
timber
i
met
her
again
on
the
long
bridge
i
held
her
hands
once
more
in
that
last
meeting
the
while
i
was
mechanically
backing
my
load
up
to
the
pit
and
making
ready
to
dump
it
are
out
of
place
in
a
brickyard
i
forgot
to
take
out
the
to
my
amazement
i
beheld
the
old
horse
skating
around
making
frantic
efforts
to
keep
its
grip
on
the
soil
then
slowly
rise
before
my
bewildered
gaze
clawing
feebly
at
the
air
as
it
went
up
and
over
backwards
into
the
pit
load
cart
and
all
i
wish
for
my
own
reputation
that
i
could
truly
say
i
wept
for
the
poor
beast
i
am
sure
i
felt
for
it
but
the
reproachful
look
it
gave
me
as
it
lay
there
on
its
back
its
four
feet
pointing
skyward
was
too
much
i
sat
upon
the
edge
of
the
pit
and
shouted
with
laughter
feeling
thoroughly
ashamed
of
my
levity
pettit
himself
checked
it
running
in
with
his
boys
and
demanding
to
know
what
i
was
doing
they
had
seen
the
accident
from
the
office
and
at
once
set
about
getting
the
horse
out
that
was
no
easy
matter
it
was
not
hurt
at
all
but
it
had
fallen
so
as
to
bend
one
of
the
shafts
of
the
truck
like
a
bow
it
had
to
be
sawed
in
two
to
get
the
horse
out
when
that
was
done
the
heavy
ash
stick
rebounding
suddenly
struck
one
of
the
boys
who
stood
by
a
blow
on
the
head
that
laid
him
out
senseless
beside
the
cart
it
was
no
time
for
laughter
then
we
ran
for
water
and
restoratives
and
brought
him
to
white
and
weak
the
horse
by
that
time
had
been
lifted
to
his
feet
and
stood
trembling
in
every
limb
ready
to
drop
it
was
a
sobered
driver
that
climbed
out
of
the
pit
at
the
tail
end
of
the
procession
which
bore
young
pettit
home
i
spent
a
miserable
hour
hanging
around
the
door
of
the
house
waiting
for
news
of
him
in
the
end
his
father
came
out
to
comfort
me
with
the
assurance
that
he
would
be
all
right
i
was
not
even
discharged
though
i
was
deposed
from
the
wagon
to
the
command
of
a
truck
of
which
i
was
myself
the
horse
i
ran
out
brick
from
the
pit
after
that
in
the
morning
more
than
twenty
years
after
addressing
the
students
of
rutgers
college
i
told
them
of
my
experience
in
the
which
was
so
near
them
at
the
end
of
my
address
a
gentleman
came
up
to
me
and
said
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
so
that
was
you
was
it
my
name
is
pettit
and
i
work
the
now
i
helped
my
father
get
that
horse
out
of
the
pit
and
i
have
cause
to
remember
that
knock
on
the
head
he
made
me
promise
sometime
to
tell
him
what
happened
to
me
since
and
if
he
will
attend
now
he
will
have
it
all
i
had
been
six
weeks
in
the
when
one
day
i
heard
of
a
company
of
real
volunteers
that
was
ready
to
sail
for
france
and
forthwith
the
war
fever
seized
me
again
that
night
i
set
out
for
little
washington
and
the
next
morning
steamer
bore
me
past
the
where
the
german
hands
dropped
their
barrows
and
cheered
me
on
with
a
howl
of
laughter
that
was
yet
not
all
derision
i
had
kept
my
end
up
with
them
and
they
knew
it
they
had
lately
let
my
alone
in
the
old
barn
their
shouts
rang
in
my
ears
nevertheless
when
i
reached
new
york
and
found
that
the
volunteers
were
gone
and
that
i
was
once
more
too
late
i
fell
back
on
the
french
consul
then
but
was
treated
very
cavalierly
there
i
suppose
i
became
a
nuisance
for
when
i
called
the
twelfth
or
twentieth
time
at
the
office
in
bowling
green
he
waxed
wroth
with
sudden
vehemence
and
tried
to
put
me
out
then
ensued
the
only
fight
of
the
war
in
which
i
was
destined
to
have
a
part
and
that
on
the
wrong
side
my
gorge
rose
at
these
continual
insults
i
grabbed
the
french
consul
by
the
nose
and
in
a
moment
we
were
rolling
down
the
oval
stairs
together
clawing
and
fighting
for
all
we
were
worth
i
know
it
was
inexcusable
but
consider
the
provocation
after
all
i
had
sacrificed
to
serve
his
people
to
be
put
out
the
second
time
like
a
beggar
and
a
tramp
i
had
this
one
chance
of
getting
even
and
that
i
took
it
was
only
human
the
racket
we
made
on
the
stairs
roused
the
whole
house
all
the
clerks
ran
out
and
threw
themselves
upon
me
they
tore
me
away
from
the
sacred
person
of
the
consul
and
thrust
me
out
into
the
street
bleeding
and
with
a
swollen
eye
to
rage
there
comforted
only
by
the
assurance
that
without
a
doubt
both
his
were
black
i
am
a
little
ashamed
not
very
much
of
the
fact
that
it
comforts
me
even
now
to
think
of
it
he
really
did
me
a
favor
that
consul
but
he
was
no
good
he
certainly
was
not
it
is
to
be
recorded
to
the
credit
of
my
resolution
if
not
of
my
common
sense
that
even
after
that
i
made
two
attempts
to
get
over
to
france
the
one
was
with
the
captain
of
a
french
that
lay
in
the
harbor
he
would
not
listen
to
me
at
all
the
other
and
the
last
was
more
successful
i
actually
got
a
job
as
stoker
on
a
french
steamer
that
was
to
sail
for
havre
that
day
in
an
hour
i
ran
all
the
way
down
to
battery
place
where
i
had
my
valise
in
a
and
all
the
way
back
arriving
at
the
pier
breathless
in
time
to
see
my
steamer
swing
out
in
the
stream
beyond
my
reach
it
was
the
last
straw
i
sat
on
the
stringpiece
and
wept
with
mortification
when
i
arose
and
went
my
way
the
war
was
over
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
it
was
that
in
fact
as
it
speedily
appeared
the
country
which
after
thirty
years
of
trial
and
bereavement
is
still
capable
of
the
dreyfus
infamy
was
not
fit
to
hold
what
was
its
own
i
am
glad
now
that
i
did
not
go
though
i
can
not
honestly
say
that
i
deserve
any
credit
for
it
all
my
money
was
gone
and
an
effort
i
made
to
join
a
railroad
gang
in
the
spuyten
duyvil
cut
came
to
nothing
again
i
reenforced
my
credit
with
my
revolver
and
the
everlasting
but
the
two
or
three
dollars
they
brought
at
the
pawnshop
were
soon
gone
and
once
more
i
was
turned
out
in
the
street
it
was
now
late
in
the
fall
the
season
was
over
the
city
was
full
of
idle
men
my
last
hope
a
promise
of
employment
in
a
factory
failed
and
homeless
and
penniless
i
joined
the
great
army
of
tramps
wandering
about
the
streets
in
the
daytime
with
the
one
aim
of
somehow
stilling
the
hunger
that
gnawed
at
my
vitals
and
fighting
at
night
with
vagrant
curs
or
outcasts
as
miserable
as
myself
for
the
protection
of
some
sheltering
or
doorway
i
was
too
proud
in
all
my
misery
to
beg
i
do
not
believe
i
ever
did
but
i
remember
well
a
basement
window
at
the
delmonico
the
silent
appearance
of
my
ravenous
face
at
which
at
a
certain
hour
in
the
evening
always
evoked
a
generous
supply
of
and
rolls
from
a
cook
who
spoke
french
that
was
the
saving
clause
i
accepted
his
rolls
as
instalments
of
the
debt
his
country
owed
me
or
ought
to
owe
me
for
my
unavailing
efforts
in
its
behalf
it
was
under
such
auspices
that
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
mulberry
bend
the
five
points
and
the
rest
of
the
slum
with
which
there
was
in
the
years
to
come
to
be
a
reckoning
for
half
a
lifetime
afterward
they
were
my
haunts
by
day
and
by
night
as
a
police
reporter
and
i
can
fairly
lay
claim
it
seems
to
me
to
a
personal
knowledge
of
the
evil
i
attacked
i
speak
of
this
because
in
a
batch
of
reviews
of
a
ten
years
war
footnote
now
the
battle
with
the
slum
which
came
yesterday
from
my
publishers
to
me
there
is
one
which
lays
it
all
to
maudlin
sensitiveness
on
my
part
illustration
lunching
at
delmonico
the
slum
says
this
writer
is
not
at
all
so
unspeakably
vile
and
measures
for
relief
based
on
my
arraignment
must
be
necessarily
abortive
every
once
in
a
while
i
am
asked
why
i
became
a
newspaper
man
for
one
thing
because
there
were
writers
of
such
trash
who
themselves
comfortably
lodged
have
not
red
blood
enough
in
their
veins
to
feel
for
those
to
whom
everything
is
denied
and
not
sense
enough
to
make
out
the
facts
when
they
see
them
or
they
would
not
call
playgrounds
schoolhouses
and
better
tenements
abortive
measures
some
one
had
to
tell
the
facts
that
is
one
reason
why
i
became
a
reporter
and
i
am
going
to
stay
one
until
the
last
of
that
ilk
has
ceased
to
discourage
men
from
trying
to
help
their
fellows
by
the
shortest
cut
they
can
find
whether
it
fits
in
a
theory
or
not
i
do
care
two
pins
for
all
the
social
theories
that
were
ever
made
unless
they
help
to
make
better
men
and
women
by
bettering
their
lot
i
have
had
cranks
of
that
order
who
rated
as
sensible
beings
in
the
ordinary
affairs
of
life
tell
me
that
i
was
doing
harm
rather
than
good
by
helping
improve
the
lot
of
the
poor
it
delayed
the
final
day
of
justice
we
were
waiting
for
not
i
do
propose
to
wait
an
hour
for
it
if
i
can
help
bring
it
on
and
i
know
i
can
there
i
do
believe
i
have
read
fifteen
reviews
of
any
of
my
books
life
is
too
short
but
i
am
glad
i
did
not
miss
that
one
those
are
the
fellows
for
whom
roosevelt
is
not
a
good
enough
reformer
who
chill
the
enthusiasm
of
mankind
with
a
deadly
chill
and
miscall
it
method
science
the
science
of
how
not
to
do
a
thing
yes
they
make
me
tired
there
was
until
last
winter
a
doorway
in
chatham
square
that
of
the
old
barnum
clothing
store
which
i
could
never
pass
without
recalling
those
nights
of
hopeless
misery
with
the
periodic
get
up
there
move
on
reenforced
by
a
prod
of
his
club
or
the
toe
of
his
boot
i
slept
there
or
tried
to
when
crowded
out
of
the
tenements
in
the
bend
by
their
utter
nastiness
cold
and
wet
weather
had
set
in
and
a
linen
duster
was
all
that
covered
my
back
there
was
a
woollen
blanket
in
my
trunk
which
i
had
from
home
the
one
my
mother
had
told
me
in
which
i
was
wrapped
when
i
was
born
but
the
trunk
was
in
the
hotel
as
security
for
money
i
owed
for
board
and
i
asked
for
it
in
vain
i
was
now
too
shabby
to
get
work
even
if
there
had
been
any
to
get
i
had
letters
still
to
friends
of
my
family
in
new
york
who
might
have
helped
me
but
hunger
and
want
had
not
conquered
my
pride
i
would
come
to
them
if
at
all
as
their
equal
and
lest
i
fall
into
temptation
i
destroyed
the
letters
so
having
burned
my
bridges
behind
me
i
was
finally
and
utterly
alone
in
the
city
with
the
winter
approaching
and
every
shivering
night
in
the
streets
reminding
me
that
a
time
was
rapidly
coming
when
such
a
life
as
i
led
could
no
longer
be
endured
not
in
a
thousand
years
would
i
be
likely
to
forget
the
night
when
it
came
it
had
rained
all
day
a
cold
october
storm
and
night
found
me
with
the
chill
downpour
unabated
down
by
the
north
river
soaked
through
and
through
with
no
chance
for
a
supper
forlorn
and
discouraged
i
sat
on
the
bulwark
listening
to
the
falling
rain
and
the
swish
of
the
dark
tide
and
thinking
of
home
how
far
it
seemed
and
how
impassable
the
gulf
now
between
the
castle
with
its
refined
ways
between
her
in
her
dainty
girlhood
and
me
sitting
there
numbed
with
the
cold
that
was
slowly
stealing
away
my
senses
with
my
courage
there
was
warmth
and
cheer
where
she
was
here
an
overpowering
sense
of
desolation
came
upon
me
i
hitched
a
little
nearer
the
edge
what
if
would
they
miss
me
much
or
long
at
home
if
no
word
came
from
me
perhaps
they
might
never
hear
what
was
the
use
of
keeping
it
up
any
longer
with
god
help
us
everything
against
and
nothing
to
back
a
lonely
lad
and
even
then
the
help
came
a
wet
and
shivering
body
was
pressed
against
mine
and
i
felt
rather
than
heard
a
piteous
whine
in
my
ear
it
was
my
companion
in
misery
a
little
outcast
afflicted
with
fits
that
had
shared
the
shelter
of
a
friendly
doorway
with
me
one
cold
night
and
had
clung
to
me
ever
since
with
a
loyal
affection
that
was
the
one
bright
spot
in
my
hard
life
as
my
hand
stole
mechanically
down
to
caress
it
it
crept
upon
my
knees
and
licked
my
face
as
if
it
meant
to
tell
me
that
there
was
one
who
understood
that
i
was
not
alone
and
the
love
of
the
faithful
little
beast
thawed
the
icicles
in
my
heart
i
picked
it
up
in
my
arms
and
fled
from
the
tempter
fled
to
where
there
were
lights
and
men
moving
if
they
cared
less
for
me
than
i
for
them
anywhere
so
that
i
saw
and
heard
the
river
no
more
in
the
midnight
hour
we
walked
into
the
church
street
police
station
and
asked
for
lodging
the
rain
was
still
pouring
in
torrents
the
sergeant
spied
the
dog
under
my
tattered
coat
and
gruffly
told
me
to
put
it
out
if
i
wanted
to
sleep
there
i
pleaded
for
it
in
vain
there
was
no
choice
to
stay
in
the
street
was
to
perish
so
i
left
my
dog
out
on
the
stoop
where
it
curled
up
to
wait
for
me
poor
little
friend
it
was
its
last
watch
the
was
jammed
with
a
foul
and
stewing
crowd
of
tramps
a
german
was
holding
forth
about
the
war
in
europe
and
crowding
me
on
my
plank
cold
and
hunger
had
not
sufficed
to
put
out
the
patriotic
spark
within
me
it
was
promptly
fanned
into
flame
and
i
told
him
what
i
thought
of
him
and
his
crew
some
irishmen
cheered
and
fomented
trouble
and
the
doorman
came
in
threatening
to
lock
us
all
up
i
smothered
my
disgust
at
the
place
as
well
as
i
could
and
slept
wearied
nearly
to
death
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
awoke
with
a
feeling
that
something
was
wrong
instinctively
i
felt
for
the
little
gold
locket
i
wore
under
my
shirt
with
a
part
of
the
precious
curl
in
it
that
was
my
last
link
with
home
it
was
gone
i
had
felt
it
there
the
last
thing
before
i
fell
asleep
one
of
the
tramp
lodgers
had
cut
the
string
and
stolen
it
with
angry
tears
i
went
up
and
complained
to
the
sergeant
that
i
had
been
robbed
he
scowled
at
me
over
the
blotter
called
me
a
thief
and
said
that
he
had
a
good
mind
to
lock
me
up
how
should
i
a
tramp
boy
have
come
by
a
gold
locket
he
had
heard
he
added
that
i
had
said
in
the
that
i
wished
the
french
would
win
and
he
would
only
be
giving
me
what
i
deserved
if
he
sent
me
to
the
island
i
heard
and
understood
he
was
himself
a
german
all
my
sufferings
rose
up
before
me
all
the
bitterness
of
my
soul
poured
itself
out
upon
him
i
do
not
know
what
i
said
i
remember
that
he
told
the
doorman
to
put
me
out
and
he
seized
me
and
threw
me
out
of
the
door
coming
after
to
kick
me
down
the
stoop
my
dog
had
been
waiting
never
taking
its
eyes
off
the
door
until
i
should
come
out
when
it
saw
me
in
the
grasp
of
the
doorman
it
fell
upon
him
at
once
fastening
its
teeth
in
his
leg
he
let
go
of
me
with
a
yell
of
pain
seized
the
poor
little
beast
by
the
legs
and
beat
its
brains
out
against
the
stone
steps
illustration
the
fight
on
the
police
station
steps
at
the
sight
a
blind
rage
seized
me
raving
like
a
madman
i
stormed
the
police
station
with
from
the
gutter
the
fury
of
my
onset
frightened
even
the
sergeant
who
saw
perhaps
that
he
had
gone
too
far
and
he
called
two
policemen
to
disarm
and
conduct
me
out
of
the
precinct
anywhere
so
that
he
got
rid
of
me
they
marched
me
to
the
nearest
ferry
and
turned
me
loose
the
halted
me
i
had
no
money
but
i
gave
him
a
silk
handkerchief
the
last
thing
about
me
that
had
any
value
and
for
that
he
let
me
cross
to
jersey
city
i
shook
the
dust
of
new
york
from
my
feet
vowing
that
i
would
never
return
and
setting
my
face
toward
the
west
marched
straight
out
the
first
railroad
track
i
came
to
and
now
right
here
begins
the
part
of
my
story
that
is
my
only
excuse
for
writing
down
these
facts
though
it
will
not
appear
for
a
while
yet
the
outrage
of
that
night
became
in
the
providence
of
god
the
means
of
putting
an
end
to
one
of
the
foulest
abuses
that
ever
disgraced
a
christian
city
and
a
mainspring
in
the
battle
with
the
slum
as
far
as
my
share
in
it
is
concerned
my
dog
did
not
die
unavenged
i
walked
all
day
following
the
track
and
in
the
afternoon
crossed
the
long
trestlework
of
the
jersey
central
railroad
over
newark
bay
with
my
face
set
toward
philadelphia
i
had
friends
there
distant
relatives
and
had
at
last
made
up
my
mind
to
go
to
them
and
ask
them
to
start
me
afresh
on
the
road
which
i
had
chosen
for
myself
i
had
come
to
the
place
before
night
i
found
company
in
other
tramps
who
had
been
over
the
road
before
and
knew
just
what
towns
to
go
around
and
which
to
walk
through
boldly
rahway
if
i
remember
rightly
was
one
of
those
to
be
severely
shunned
i
discovered
presently
that
i
was
on
the
great
highway
with
the
column
moving
south
on
its
autumn
hegira
to
warmer
climes
i
can
not
say
i
fancied
the
company
tramps
never
had
any
attraction
for
me
as
a
sociological
problem
or
otherwise
i
was
compelled
more
than
once
to
be
of
and
with
them
but
i
shook
their
company
as
quickly
as
i
could
as
for
the
problem
they
are
supposed
to
represent
i
think
the
workhouse
and
the
police
are
quite
competent
to
deal
with
that
provided
it
is
not
a
tammany
police
it
does
not
differ
appreciably
from
the
problem
of
human
laziness
in
any
other
shape
or
age
we
got
some
light
on
that
which
ought
to
convince
anybody
when
under
mayor
strong
administration
we
tried
to
deal
intelligently
with
vagrancy
of
the
homeless
applicants
for
night
shelter
were
fat
young
loafers
who
would
work
that
is
not
my
statement
but
the
report
of
the
doctor
who
saw
them
stripped
taking
their
bath
the
bath
and
the
investigation
presently
decreased
their
numbers
until
in
a
week
scarcely
anything
was
left
of
the
problem
that
had
bothered
us
so
four
days
i
was
on
the
way
to
philadelphia
living
on
apples
and
an
occasional
meal
earned
by
doing
odd
jobs
at
night
i
slept
in
lonely
barns
that
nearly
always
had
a
board
ripped
out
the
door
i
tried
to
avoid
the
gang
but
i
was
not
always
successful
i
remember
still
with
a
shudder
an
instance
of
that
kind
i
was
burrowing
in
a
haymow
thinking
myself
alone
in
the
night
a
big
storm
came
up
the
thunder
shook
the
old
barn
and
i
sat
up
wondering
if
it
would
be
blown
away
a
fierce
filled
it
with
a
ghostly
light
and
showed
me
within
arm
length
a
white
and
scared
face
with
eyes
starting
from
their
sockets
at
the
sight
of
me
the
next
moment
all
was
black
darkness
again
my
heart
stood
still
for
what
seemed
the
longest
moment
of
my
life
then
there
came
out
of
the
darkness
a
quaking
voice
asking
is
anybody
there
for
once
i
was
glad
to
have
a
live
tramp
about
i
really
thought
it
was
a
ghost
the
last
few
miles
to
camden
i
rode
in
a
arriving
there
at
night
much
the
worse
for
the
wear
of
it
on
my
linen
duster
in
the
i
was
picked
up
by
a
police
captain
who
took
me
to
his
station
made
me
tell
him
my
story
and
gave
me
a
bed
in
an
unused
cell
the
door
of
which
he
took
the
precaution
to
lock
on
the
outside
but
i
did
not
mind
rather
that
a
hundred
times
than
the
in
the
new
york
in
the
morning
he
gave
me
breakfast
and
money
to
get
my
boots
blacked
and
to
pay
my
fare
across
the
delaware
and
so
my
homeless
wanderings
came
for
the
time
being
to
an
end
for
in
philadelphia
i
found
in
the
danish
consul
ferdinand
myhlertz
and
his
dear
wife
friends
indeed
as
in
need
the
city
of
brotherly
love
found
heart
and
time
to
welcome
the
wanderer
though
at
the
time
it
was
torn
up
by
the
hottest
kind
of
fight
over
the
question
whether
or
not
to
disfigure
the
beautiful
square
at
broad
and
market
streets
by
putting
the
new
municipal
building
there
when
after
two
weeks
rest
with
my
friends
they
sent
me
on
my
way
to
an
old
schoolmate
in
jamestown
clothed
and
in
my
right
mind
i
was
none
the
worse
for
my
first
lesson
in
swimming
against
the
current
and
quite
sure
that
next
time
i
should
be
able
to
breast
it
hope
springs
eternal
at
i
had
many
a
weary
stretch
ahead
before
i
was
to
make
port
but
with
youth
and
courage
as
the
equipment
one
should
win
almost
any
fight
chapter
iv
working
and
wandering
winter
came
quickly
up
by
the
northern
lakes
but
it
had
no
terror
for
me
for
once
i
had
shelter
and
enough
to
eat
it
found
me
felling
trees
on
swede
hill
where
a
considerable
settlement
of
scandinavians
was
growing
up
i
had
tried
my
hand
at
making
cradles
in
a
but
at
two
dollars
and
forty
cents
per
dozen
there
was
not
much
profit
in
it
so
i
took
to
the
woods
and
learned
to
swing
an
axe
in
the
american
fashion
that
had
charmed
me
so
at
brady
bend
i
liked
it
much
better
anyway
than
being
in
the
house
winter
and
summer
it
is
well
that
we
are
fashioned
that
way
some
for
indoors
and
some
for
outdoors
for
so
the
work
of
the
world
is
all
done
but
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
the
indoor
folk
take
too
big
a
share
of
credit
to
themselves
as
though
there
were
special
virtue
in
that
though
i
think
that
the
reverse
is
the
case
at
least
it
seems
more
natural
to
want
to
be
out
in
the
open
where
the
sun
shines
and
the
winds
blow
when
i
was
not
chopping
wood
i
was
helping
with
the
ice
harvest
on
the
lake
or
repairing
the
steamer
that
ran
in
summer
between
jamestown
and
mayville
my
home
was
in
dexterville
a
mile
or
so
out
of
town
where
there
lived
a
danish
family
the
romers
at
whose
home
i
was
made
welcome
the
friendship
which
grew
up
between
us
has
endured
through
life
and
been
to
me
a
treasure
gentler
and
truer
hearts
than
those
of
nicholas
and
john
romer
there
are
not
many
i
shared
my
room
with
another
countryman
anthony
ronne
a
young
who
like
myself
was
in
hard
luck
the
had
burned
down
and
with
no
work
in
sight
the
outlook
for
him
was
not
exactly
bright
he
had
not
my
way
of
laughing
it
off
but
was
rather
disposed
to
see
the
serious
side
of
it
probably
that
was
the
reason
we
took
to
each
other
the
balance
was
restored
so
maybe
he
sobered
me
down
somewhat
if
any
one
assumes
that
in
my
role
of
unhappy
lover
i
went
about
glooming
and
glowering
on
mankind
he
makes
a
big
mistake
besides
i
had
not
the
least
notion
of
accepting
that
role
as
permanent
i
was
out
to
twist
the
wheel
of
fortune
my
way
when
i
could
get
my
hands
upon
it
i
never
doubted
that
i
should
do
that
sooner
or
later
if
only
i
kept
doing
things
that
elizabeth
should
ever
marry
anybody
but
me
was
preposterously
impossible
no
matter
what
she
or
anybody
said
was
this
madness
they
half
thought
so
at
home
when
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
it
in
my
letters
not
at
all
it
was
conviction
the
conviction
that
shapes
events
and
the
world
to
its
ends
i
know
what
i
am
talking
about
if
any
one
doubts
it
and
thinks
his
a
worse
case
than
mine
let
him
try
my
plan
if
he
can
not
muster
up
courage
to
do
it
it
is
the
best
proof
in
the
world
that
she
was
right
in
refusing
him
to
return
to
my
chum
he
on
his
part
rose
to
the
height
even
of
going
out
but
not
with
me
there
was
a
physical
obstacle
to
that
we
had
but
one
coat
between
us
a
turned
black
kersey
worn
very
smooth
and
shiny
also
on
the
wrong
side
which
i
had
bought
of
a
dealer
in
philadelphia
for
a
dollar
it
was
our
and
we
took
turns
arraying
ourselves
in
it
for
the
dexterville
weekly
parties
these
gatherings
interested
me
chiefly
as
outbreaks
of
the
peculiar
american
humor
that
was
very
taking
to
me
in
and
out
of
the
newspapers
dancing
being
tabooed
as
immoral
and
contaminating
the
young
people
had
recourse
to
particularly
energetic
kissing
games
which
more
than
made
up
for
their
deprivation
on
the
other
score
it
was
all
very
harmless
and
very
funny
and
the
winter
wore
away
pleasantly
enough
in
spite
of
hard
luck
and
hard
work
when
there
was
any
with
the
early
thaw
came
change
my
friends
moved
away
to
buffalo
and
i
was
left
for
two
months
the
sole
occupant
of
the
romer
homestead
my
last
job
gave
out
about
that
time
and
a
wheelbarrow
express
which
i
established
between
and
the
steamboat
landing
on
the
lake
refused
to
prosper
the
idea
was
good
enough
but
i
was
ahead
of
my
time
travel
on
the
lake
had
not
yet
begun
with
my
field
thus
narrowed
down
i
fell
back
on
my
gun
and
some
old
i
found
in
the
woodshed
i
became
a
hunter
and
trapper
right
below
me
was
the
glen
through
which
the
creek
ran
on
its
way
to
the
sawmills
and
of
jamestown
it
was
full
of
that
burrowed
in
its
banks
between
the
roots
of
dead
hemlocks
and
pines
there
i
set
my
traps
and
baited
them
with
carrots
and
turnips
the
manner
of
it
was
simple
enough
i
set
the
trap
on
the
bottom
of
the
creek
and
hung
the
bait
on
a
stick
projecting
from
the
bank
over
it
so
that
to
get
at
it
the
rat
had
to
step
on
the
trap
i
caught
lots
of
them
their
skins
brought
twenty
cents
apiece
in
the
town
so
that
i
was
really
quite
independent
i
made
often
as
much
as
a
dollar
overnight
with
my
traps
and
then
had
the
whole
day
to
myself
in
the
hills
where
i
waylaid
many
a
fat
rabbit
or
squirrel
and
an
occasional
bird
illustration
there
i
set
my
traps
the
one
thing
that
marred
my
enjoyment
of
this
life
of
freedom
was
my
vain
struggle
to
master
the
art
of
cookery
in
its
elements
to
properly
get
the
hang
of
that
and
of
housekeeping
in
general
two
heads
are
needed
as
i
have
found
out
since
one
of
them
with
curls
and
long
eyelashes
then
it
is
fine
fun
but
it
is
not
good
for
man
to
tackle
that
job
alone
goodness
knows
i
tried
hard
enough
i
remember
the
first
omelet
i
made
i
was
bound
to
get
it
good
so
i
made
a
of
all
the
good
things
romer
had
left
in
the
house
and
put
them
all
in
eggs
and
strawberry
jam
and
raisins
and
and
some
sliced
bacon
the
way
i
had
seen
mother
do
with
egg
pancakes
but
though
i
seasoned
it
liberally
with
to
make
it
rise
it
did
not
rise
it
was
dreadfully
heavy
and
discouraging
and
not
even
the
strawberry
jam
had
power
to
redeem
it
to
tell
the
truth
it
was
not
a
good
omelet
it
was
hardly
fit
to
eat
the
jam
came
out
to
better
advantage
in
the
sago
i
boiled
but
there
was
too
much
of
it
it
was
only
a
full
but
i
never
saw
anything
swell
so
it
boiled
out
of
the
pot
and
into
another
and
another
while
i
kept
pouring
on
water
until
nearly
every
jar
in
the
house
was
full
of
sago
that
stood
around
until
moss
grew
on
it
with
age
there
is
much
contrariness
in
cooking
when
i
tapped
my
maples
with
the
rest
there
were
two
big
trees
in
front
of
the
house
and
tried
to
make
sugar
i
was
prepared
to
see
the
sap
boil
away
but
when
i
had
labored
a
whole
day
and
burned
half
a
cord
of
wood
and
had
for
my
trouble
half
a
of
sugar
which
made
me
sick
into
the
bargain
i
concluded
that
that
game
was
not
worth
the
candle
and
gave
up
my
plans
of
becoming
a
on
a
larger
scale
it
was
at
this
time
that
i
made
my
first
appearance
on
the
lecture
platform
there
was
a
scandinavian
society
in
jamestown
composed
chiefly
of
workingmen
whose
fight
with
life
had
left
them
little
enough
time
for
schooling
they
were
anxious
to
learn
however
and
as
i
was
set
on
teaching
where
i
saw
the
chance
the
thing
came
of
itself
i
had
been
mightily
interested
in
the
frenchman
account
of
the
formation
and
development
of
the
earth
and
took
that
for
my
topic
twice
a
week
when
i
had
set
my
traps
in
the
glen
i
went
to
town
and
talked
astronomy
and
geology
to
interested
audiences
that
gazed
terror
stricken
at
the
loathsome
saurians
and
the
damnable
pterodactyl
which
i
sketched
on
the
blackboard
well
they
might
i
spared
them
no
gruesome
detail
and
i
never
could
draw
anyhow
however
i
rescued
them
from
those
beasts
in
season
and
together
we
hauled
the
earth
through
showers
of
molten
metal
into
the
sunlight
of
our
day
i
sometimes
carried
home
as
much
as
two
or
three
dollars
after
paying
for
gas
and
hall
with
the
tickets
ten
cents
apiece
and
i
saw
wealth
and
fame
ahead
of
me
when
sudden
wreck
came
to
my
hopes
and
my
career
as
a
lecturer
it
was
all
because
having
got
the
earth
properly
constructed
and
set
up
as
it
were
i
undertook
to
explain
about
latitude
and
longitude
figures
came
in
there
and
i
was
never
strong
at
mathematics
my
education
in
that
branch
had
run
into
a
snag
about
the
middle
of
the
little
multiplication
table
a
boy
from
the
plebs
school
challenged
me
to
fight
as
i
was
making
my
way
to
recitation
trying
to
learn
the
table
by
heart
i
broke
off
in
the
middle
of
the
sixes
to
wallop
him
and
never
got
any
farther
the
class
went
on
that
day
without
me
and
i
never
overtook
it
i
made
but
little
effort
in
the
latin
school
which
rather
prided
itself
upon
being
free
from
the
commercial
taint
mathematics
was
held
to
be
in
the
nature
of
an
intrusion
and
it
was
a
sort
of
good
mark
for
a
boy
that
he
did
not
take
to
it
if
at
the
same
time
he
showed
aptitude
for
language
so
i
was
left
to
deplore
with
marjorie
fleming
to
the
end
of
my
days
the
inherent
viciousness
of
sevens
and
eights
as
more
than
human
nature
can
endure
it
is
one
of
the
ironies
of
life
that
i
should
have
had
to
take
up
work
into
which
the
study
of
statistics
enters
largely
but
the
powers
that
set
me
the
task
provided
a
fitter
back
than
mine
for
that
burden
as
i
explained
years
ago
in
the
preface
to
how
the
other
half
lives
the
patient
friendship
of
roger
tracy
the
learned
statistician
of
the
health
department
has
smoothed
the
rebellious
kinks
out
of
and
population
statistics
as
of
so
many
other
knotty
problems
which
we
have
worked
out
together
but
i
am
getting
out
of
my
longitude
as
i
did
then
when
i
had
groped
about
long
enough
trying
to
make
my
audience
understand
what
i
only
half
understood
myself
an
old
arose
in
his
place
and
said
that
any
man
who
would
make
a
mess
of
so
simple
a
thing
as
latitude
and
longitude
evidently
knew
nothing
at
all
it
happened
to
be
the
one
thing
he
knew
about
popular
favor
is
a
fickle
thing
the
audience
that
had
but
now
been
applauding
my
efforts
to
organize
the
earth
took
his
word
for
it
without
waiting
for
an
explanation
and
went
out
in
a
body
scouting
even
the
ichthyosaurus
as
a
prehistoric
fake
i
made
a
valiant
effort
to
stem
the
tide
but
came
to
worse
grief
than
before
my
only
listener
was
a
swedish
blacksmith
who
had
attended
the
creation
and
development
of
the
earth
from
the
beginning
with
unshaken
faith
though
he
was
a
member
of
the
lutheran
church
with
the
pastor
and
deacons
of
which
i
had
waged
a
bitter
newspaper
war
over
the
sin
of
dancing
but
when
i
said
on
the
authority
of
figuier
that
an
english
had
once
during
an
earthquake
been
thrown
into
the
city
of
callao
and
through
the
roof
of
a
church
between
the
walls
of
which
it
remained
standing
upright
on
its
keel
he
got
up
and
went
too
he
circulated
the
story
in
town
with
various
embellishments
the
deacons
aforesaid
seized
upon
it
as
welcome
ammunition
construing
it
into
an
insult
to
the
church
and
there
was
an
end
to
my
lecturing
the
warm
spring
weather
together
with
these
disappointments
bred
in
me
the
desire
to
roam
i
packed
away
my
traps
and
started
for
buffalo
with
my
grip
walking
along
the
lake
it
set
in
with
a
drizzling
rain
and
i
was
soon
wet
to
the
skin
where
the
chautauqua
summer
school
grounds
are
now
i
surprised
a
flock
of
wild
ducks
near
the
shore
and
was
lucky
enough
to
wound
one
with
my
revolver
but
the
wind
carried
it
out
of
my
reach
and
i
trudged
on
supperless
through
mayville
where
the
lights
were
beginning
to
shine
in
the
windows
not
one
of
them
was
for
me
all
my
money
had
gone
to
pay
back
debts
to
my
dexterville
landlady
the
danes
had
a
good
name
in
jamestown
and
we
were
all
very
jealous
of
it
we
would
have
starved
every
one
of
us
rather
than
leave
unpaid
debts
behind
as
ben
wah
many
years
after
put
it
to
me
it
is
no
disgrace
to
be
poor
but
it
is
sometimes
very
inconvenient
i
found
it
so
when
worn
out
with
walking
i
crawled
into
an
abandoned
barn
halfway
to
westfield
and
dug
down
in
the
hay
wet
through
and
hungry
as
a
bear
it
stormed
and
rained
all
night
and
a
rat
or
a
squirrel
fell
from
the
roof
on
my
face
it
felt
like
a
big
sprawling
hand
and
woke
me
up
in
a
great
fright
the
sun
was
shining
upon
a
peaceful
sabbath
when
i
crawled
out
of
my
hole
and
saw
to
my
dismay
that
i
had
been
sleeping
in
a
pile
of
old
hay
seed
that
had
worked
through
and
through
my
wet
clothes
until
i
was
a
sight
an
hour
patient
plucking
and
a
bath
in
a
pond
restored
me
to
something
like
human
shape
and
i
held
my
entry
into
westfield
the
people
were
going
to
church
in
their
holiday
clothes
and
eyed
the
uncouth
stranger
askance
i
travelled
the
whole
length
of
the
town
thinking
what
to
do
next
my
stomach
decided
for
me
there
was
a
house
standing
in
a
pretty
garden
with
two
little
negro
boys
for
at
the
steps
i
rang
the
bell
and
to
an
old
lady
who
opened
the
door
i
offered
to
chop
wood
fetch
water
or
do
anything
there
was
to
do
in
exchange
for
breakfast
she
went
in
and
brought
out
her
husband
who
looked
me
over
and
said
that
if
i
was
willing
to
do
his
chores
i
need
go
no
farther
i
was
tired
and
famished
and
the
place
was
so
restful
that
i
said
yes
at
once
in
ten
minutes
i
was
eating
my
breakfast
in
the
kitchen
duly
installed
as
spencer
hired
man
i
think
of
the
month
i
spent
in
the
doctor
house
with
mingled
feelings
of
exasperation
and
amusement
if
i
had
not
learned
to
milk
a
cow
there
probably
octavia
ely
would
never
have
come
into
my
life
horrid
nightmare
that
she
was
octavia
ely
was
a
jersey
cow
with
a
brass
tag
in
her
ear
whose
attacks
upon
the
domestic
peace
of
my
house
in
after
years
even
now
fill
me
with
rage
in
the
twelve
months
of
her
sojourn
with
us
she
had
fifteen
different
kinds
of
disease
every
one
of
which
advertised
itself
by
the
stopping
of
her
milk
when
she
had
none
she
never
once
gave
down
the
milk
without
grudging
it
with
three
of
us
to
hold
her
legs
and
tail
lest
she
step
in
the
pail
or
switch
our
ears
she
would
reach
back
and
eat
the
vest
off
my
back
where
i
sat
milking
her
but
she
does
not
belong
in
this
story
thank
goodness
if
she
had
never
belonged
to
me
or
mine
i
should
be
a
better
man
she
provoked
me
so
however
i
can
not
reasonably
lay
the
blame
for
her
on
the
doctor
his
cow
was
friendly
enough
it
was
sport
the
old
dog
that
made
the
heaviest
and
at
the
same
time
a
most
ludicrous
item
in
my
duties
as
hired
man
long
past
the
age
of
sport
of
any
kind
he
spent
his
decadent
years
in
a
state
of
abject
fear
of
thunder
and
lightning
if
only
a
cloud
darkened
the
sun
sport
kept
up
a
ceaseless
pilgrimage
between
his
corner
and
the
kitchen
door
to
observe
the
sky
sighing
most
grievously
at
the
outlook
at
the
first
distant
rumble
this
was
in
the
month
of
may
when
it
thundered
almost
every
day
he
became
perfectly
rigid
with
terror
it
was
my
duty
then
to
carry
him
down
into
the
cellar
and
shut
him
in
the
where
he
was
out
of
the
way
of
it
all
poor
sport
laid
his
head
against
my
shoulder
and
wept
great
tears
that
wrung
peals
of
laughter
from
me
and
from
the
boys
who
always
hung
around
to
see
the
show
one
of
these
was
just
beginning
the
struggle
with
his
homer
which
i
knew
by
heart
almost
and
it
may
have
been
the
discovery
that
i
was
able
to
steer
him
through
it
between
chores
as
well
as
to
teach
him
some
tricks
of
fencing
that
helped
make
the
doctor
anxious
that
i
should
promise
to
stay
with
him
always
he
would
make
me
rich
he
said
but
other
ambitions
than
to
milk
cows
and
plant
garden
truck
were
stirring
in
me
to
be
rich
was
never
among
them
i
had
begun
to
write
essays
for
the
magazines
choosing
for
my
topic
for
want
of
any
other
the
maltreatment
of
denmark
by
prussia
which
rankled
fresh
in
my
memory
and
the
duty
of
all
scandinavians
to
rise
up
and
avenge
it
the
scandinavians
would
not
listen
when
i
wrote
in
danish
and
my
english
outpourings
never
reached
the
publishers
i
discovered
that
i
lacked
words
they
did
pour
at
which
in
general
discontentment
with
myself
and
all
things
i
pulled
up
stakes
and
went
to
buffalo
only
this
time
i
rode
in
a
railway
train
with
money
in
my
pocket
for
all
that
buffalo
received
me
with
no
more
circumstance
than
it
had
done
when
i
came
there
penniless
on
the
way
to
the
war
the
year
before
i
piled
boards
in
a
until
i
picked
a
quarrel
with
a
tyrant
foreman
on
behalf
of
a
lot
of
green
germans
whom
he
maltreated
most
shamefully
then
i
was
put
out
a
in
the
beehive
a
factory
building
out
in
niagara
street
hired
me
next
to
make
bedsteads
and
took
me
to
board
with
him
in
the
top
story
of
the
factory
we
fitted
up
a
bedroom
that
was
just
large
enough
for
one
sitting
and
two
standing
so
long
as
the
door
was
not
opened
then
one
of
the
two
had
to
get
out
it
mattered
little
for
the
only
visitor
i
had
was
a
countryman
of
mine
whom
they
had
worked
so
hard
in
his
childhood
that
he
had
never
had
a
chance
to
go
to
school
we
two
labored
together
by
my
little
lamp
and
it
was
great
fun
to
see
him
who
had
never
known
how
to
read
and
write
his
own
danish
make
long
strides
in
the
strange
tongue
he
spoke
so
singularly
well
when
we
were
both
tired
out
we
would
climb
up
on
the
roof
and
lie
there
and
look
out
over
the
lake
and
the
city
where
the
myriad
lights
were
shining
and
talk
of
the
old
home
and
old
times
sometimes
the
new
would
crowd
them
out
in
spite
of
all
i
remember
that
fourth
of
july
when
the
salute
from
fort
porter
woke
me
up
at
sunrise
and
fired
me
with
sudden
patriotic
ardor
i
jumped
out
of
bed
and
grabbed
my
revolver
there
was
a
pile
of
in
the
yard
below
and
knowing
that
there
was
no
one
around
whom
i
could
hurt
i
made
it
my
target
and
fired
away
all
my
ammunition
at
it
it
made
a
fine
racket
and
i
was
happy
a
couple
of
days
later
when
i
was
down
in
the
yard
it
occurred
to
me
to
look
at
the
boxes
to
ascertain
what
kind
of
a
score
i
had
made
a
very
good
one
all
the
bullets
had
hit
the
boxes
looked
like
so
many
sieves
incidentally
i
found
out
that
they
were
not
empty
as
i
had
supposed
but
filled
with
glass
i
had
eventually
to
give
that
job
up
also
because
my
boss
was
bad
pay
he
was
pretty
much
all
bad
i
guess
i
do
think
his
house
was
the
most
disorderly
one
i
have
ever
come
across
seven
children
clamored
about
the
table
fighting
with
their
even
more
mother
she
used
to
single
out
the
one
she
wished
to
address
by
slamming
a
handful
of
or
whatever
greens
might
be
at
hand
across
the
table
at
him
the
youngster
would
fire
it
back
and
so
they
were
with
each
other
the
father
was
seldom
sober
at
meals
when
he
felt
funny
he
would
stealthily
pour
a
glass
of
water
down
the
nearest
child
back
and
then
sit
and
chuckle
over
the
havoc
he
had
wrought
there
followed
a
long
and
woful
wail
and
an
instant
explosion
from
the
mother
in
this
wise
i
can
hear
her
now
it
was
always
the
same
whereupon
from
sheer
exhaustion
all
round
there
was
peace
for
at
least
five
minutes
which
reminds
me
of
meeting
adler
my
chum
from
brady
bend
in
buffalo
he
had
come
up
to
get
a
place
as
he
informed
me
that
would
about
satisfy
him
that
such
jobs
were
waiting
by
the
score
for
an
educated
german
in
this
barbarous
land
he
never
doubted
for
a
moment
in
the
end
he
went
to
work
in
a
at
a
dollar
a
day
adler
was
ever
a
stickler
for
etiquette
in
bend
we
had
very
little
of
it
at
mealtimes
a
flock
of
chickens
used
to
come
into
the
summer
kitchen
where
we
ate
and
forage
around
to
adler
great
disgust
one
day
they
deliberately
flew
up
on
the
table
and
fell
to
fighting
with
the
boarders
for
the
food
a
big
shanghai
rooster
trod
in
the
butter
and
tracked
it
over
the
table
at
the
sight
adler
rage
knew
no
bounds
seizing
a
of
bread
he
aimed
it
at
the
rooster
and
felled
him
in
his
tracks
the
flock
of
fowl
flew
squawking
out
of
the
door
the
women
screamed
and
the
men
howled
with
laughter
adler
flourished
another
loaf
and
vowed
vengeance
upon
bird
or
beast
that
did
not
let
the
butter
alone
i
have
been
often
enough
out
of
patience
with
the
ways
of
the
labor
men
which
seem
to
me
to
be
the
greatest
hindrance
to
the
success
of
their
cause
but
i
am
not
in
danger
of
forgetting
the
other
side
which
makes
that
cause
if
for
no
other
reason
because
of
an
experience
i
had
in
buffalo
that
year
in
a
in
which
i
had
found
employment
i
contracted
with
the
boss
to
plane
doors
sandpaper
them
and
plug
at
fifteen
cents
a
door
it
was
his
own
offer
and
i
did
the
work
well
better
than
it
had
been
done
before
so
he
said
himself
but
when
he
found
at
the
end
of
the
week
that
i
had
made
where
my
predecessor
had
made
only
ten
he
cut
the
price
down
to
twelve
cents
i
objected
but
in
the
end
swallowed
my
anger
and
by
putting
on
extra
steam
and
working
overtime
made
the
next
week
the
boss
examined
the
work
very
carefully
said
it
was
good
paid
my
wages
and
cut
down
the
price
to
ten
cents
he
did
not
want
his
men
to
make
over
a
week
he
said
it
was
not
good
for
them
i
quit
then
after
giving
him
my
opinion
of
him
and
of
the
chances
of
his
shop
i
do
not
know
where
he
may
be
now
but
wherever
he
is
i
will
warrant
that
my
prediction
came
true
there
is
in
danish
an
old
proverb
falsk
slaar
sin
egen
herre
paa
hals
which
is
to
say
that
chickens
come
home
to
roost
and
that
right
in
the
end
does
prevail
over
might
the
lord
chief
justice
over
all
is
not
to
be
tricked
if
the
labor
men
will
only
remember
that
and
devote
let
us
say
as
much
time
to
their
duties
as
to
fighting
for
their
rights
they
will
get
them
sooner
which
is
not
saying
that
there
is
not
a
time
to
strike
witness
my
experience
with
the
man
i
struck
not
only
against
him
but
against
the
whole
city
of
buffalo
i
shook
the
dust
of
it
from
my
feet
and
went
out
to
work
with
a
gang
on
a
new
railroad
then
being
built
through
cattaraugus
county
the
buffalo
and
washington
i
think
near
a
village
called
coonville
our
job
was
cut
out
for
us
we
were
twenty
in
the
gang
and
we
were
to
build
the
line
across
an
old
dry
at
that
point
in
the
middle
of
the
river
there
had
once
been
a
island
this
we
attacked
with
pickaxe
and
spade
and
carried
it
away
piecemeal
in
our
wheelbarrows
it
fell
in
with
the
hottest
weather
of
the
year
down
in
the
hollow
where
no
wind
blew
it
was
utterly
unbearable
i
had
never
done
such
work
before
and
was
not
built
for
it
i
did
my
best
to
keep
up
with
the
gang
but
my
chest
heaved
and
my
heart
beat
as
though
it
would
burst
there
were
nineteen
irishmen
in
the
gang
big
rough
fellows
who
had
picked
me
out
as
the
only
dutchman
as
the
butt
for
their
coarse
jokes
but
when
they
saw
that
the
work
was
plainly
too
much
for
me
the
other
side
of
this
curiously
contradictory
and
people
came
out
they
invented
a
thousand
excuses
to
get
me
out
of
the
line
water
was
certainly
not
their
daily
diet
but
they
fell
victims
one
and
all
to
the
most
ravening
thirst
which
required
the
despatching
of
me
every
hour
to
the
spring
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
to
fill
the
pail
if
they
could
not
empty
it
quickly
enough
they
managed
to
upset
it
and
to
cover
up
the
fraud
cursed
each
other
roundly
for
their
clumsiness
between
whiles
they
worried
me
as
ever
with
their
horseplay
but
i
had
seen
the
real
man
behind
it
and
they
might
have
called
me
bismarck
had
they
chosen
without
offence
the
heat
the
work
and
the
of
a
foreman
were
too
much
for
them
even
and
before
the
end
of
a
week
the
gang
was
broken
and
scattered
wide
i
was
on
the
road
again
looking
for
work
on
a
farm
it
was
not
to
be
had
perhaps
i
did
not
try
very
hard
sunday
morning
found
me
spending
my
last
quarter
for
breakfast
in
an
inn
at
lime
lake
when
i
had
eaten
i
went
out
in
the
fields
and
sat
with
my
back
against
a
tree
and
listened
to
the
that
were
ringing
also
i
knew
in
my
home
four
thousand
miles
away
i
saw
the
venerable
domkirke
my
father
gray
head
in
his
pew
and
her
young
and
innocent
in
the
women
seats
across
the
aisle
i
heard
the
old
pastor
voice
in
the
solemn
calm
and
my
tears
fell
upon
her
picture
that
had
called
up
the
vision
it
was
as
if
a
voice
spoke
to
me
and
said
to
get
up
and
be
a
man
that
if
i
wanted
to
win
elizabeth
to
work
for
her
was
the
way
and
not
idling
my
days
away
on
the
road
and
i
got
right
up
and
setting
my
face
toward
buffalo
went
by
the
shortest
cut
back
to
my
work
illustration
our
old
pastor
i
walked
day
and
night
pursued
in
the
dark
by
a
hundred
skulking
curs
that
lurked
behind
trees
until
i
came
abreast
of
them
and
then
sallied
out
to
challenge
my
progress
i
stoned
them
and
went
on
monday
setting
sun
saw
me
outside
buffalo
tired
but
with
a
new
purpose
i
had
walked
fifty
miles
without
stopping
or
eating
i
slept
under
a
shed
that
night
and
the
very
next
day
found
work
at
good
wages
on
some
steamers
the
erie
railroad
was
then
building
for
the
lake
superior
trade
with
intervals
of
other
employment
when
for
any
reason
work
in
the
was
slack
i
kept
that
up
all
winter
and
became
quite
opulent
even
to
the
extent
of
buying
a
new
suit
of
clothes
the
first
i
had
had
since
i
landed
i
paid
off
all
my
debts
and
quarrelled
with
all
my
friends
about
religion
i
never
had
any
patience
with
a
person
who
says
there
is
no
god
the
man
is
a
fool
and
therefore
can
not
be
reasoned
with
but
in
those
days
i
was
set
on
converting
him
as
my
viking
forefathers
did
when
from
heathen
they
became
christians
by
fire
and
sword
if
need
be
i
smote
the
infidels
about
me
hip
and
thigh
but
there
were
a
good
many
of
them
and
they
kept
springing
up
to
my
great
amazement
probably
the
constant
warfare
imparted
a
tinge
of
fierceness
to
that
whole
period
of
my
life
for
i
remember
that
one
of
my
employers
a
roman
catholic
builder
discharged
me
for
disagreeing
with
him
about
the
saints
telling
me
that
i
was
too
blamed
independent
anyhow
i
suspect
i
must
have
been
a
rather
unlovely
customer
take
it
all
together
still
every
once
in
a
while
it
boils
up
in
me
yet
against
the
discretion
that
has
come
with
the
years
and
i
want
to
slam
in
after
the
old
fashion
seems
to
me
we
are
in
danger
of
growing
stale
with
all
our
soft
speeches
nowadays
things
enough
happened
to
take
down
my
a
good
many
pegs
it
was
about
this
time
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
into
the
newspaper
business
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
reporter
was
the
highest
and
noblest
of
all
callings
no
one
could
sift
wrong
from
right
as
he
and
punish
the
wrong
in
that
i
was
right
i
have
not
changed
my
opinion
on
that
point
one
whit
and
i
am
sure
i
never
shall
the
power
of
fact
is
the
mightiest
lever
of
this
or
of
any
day
the
reporter
has
his
hand
upon
it
and
it
is
his
grievous
fault
if
he
does
not
use
it
well
i
thought
i
would
make
a
good
reporter
my
father
had
edited
our
local
newspaper
and
such
little
help
as
i
had
been
of
to
him
had
given
me
a
taste
for
the
business
being
of
that
mind
i
went
to
the
office
one
morning
and
asked
for
the
editor
he
was
not
in
apparently
nobody
was
i
wandered
through
room
after
room
all
empty
till
at
last
i
came
to
one
in
which
sat
a
man
with
a
and
a
pair
of
long
shears
this
must
be
the
editor
he
had
the
implements
of
his
trade
i
told
him
my
errand
while
he
clipped
away
figure
when
i
worked
in
the
buffalo
what
is
it
you
want
he
asked
when
i
had
ceased
speaking
and
waited
for
an
answer
work
i
said
work
said
he
waving
me
haughtily
away
with
the
shears
we
do
work
here
this
is
a
newspaper
office
i
went
abashed
i
tried
the
express
next
this
time
i
had
the
editor
pointed
out
to
me
he
was
just
coming
through
the
business
office
at
the
door
i
stopped
him
and
preferred
my
request
he
looked
me
over
a
lad
fresh
from
the
shipyard
with
horny
hands
and
a
rough
coat
and
asked
what
are
you
a
carpenter
i
said
the
man
turned
upon
his
heel
with
a
loud
rasping
laugh
and
shut
the
door
in
my
face
for
a
moment
i
stood
there
stunned
his
ascending
steps
on
the
stairs
brought
back
my
senses
i
ran
to
the
door
and
flung
it
open
you
laugh
i
shouted
shaking
my
fist
at
him
standing
halfway
up
the
stairs
you
laugh
now
but
wait
and
then
i
got
the
grip
of
my
temper
and
slammed
the
door
in
my
turn
all
the
same
in
that
hour
it
was
settled
that
i
was
to
be
a
reporter
i
knew
it
as
i
went
out
into
the
street
chapter
v
i
go
into
business
headlong
somewhat
suddenly
and
quite
unexpectedly
a
business
career
opened
for
me
that
winter
once
i
had
tried
to
crowd
into
it
uninvited
but
the
result
was
not
good
it
was
when
i
had
observed
that
for
the
want
of
the
window
reflectors
which
were
much
in
use
in
the
old
country
american
ladies
were
at
a
disadvantage
in
their
homes
in
not
being
able
to
make
out
undesirable
company
at
a
distance
themselves
unseen
and
conveniently
forgetting
that
they
were
in
this
civilizing
agency
i
set
about
supplying
forthwith
i
made
a
model
and
took
it
to
a
yankee
business
man
to
whom
i
explained
its
use
he
listened
attentively
took
the
model
and
said
he
had
a
good
mind
to
have
me
locked
up
for
infringing
the
patent
laws
of
other
lands
but
because
i
had
sinned
from
ignorance
he
would
refrain
his
manner
was
so
impressive
that
he
really
made
me
uneasy
lest
i
had
broken
some
kind
of
a
law
i
knew
not
of
from
the
fact
that
not
long
after
window
reflectors
began
to
make
their
appearance
in
buffalo
i
infer
that
whatever
the
enactment
it
did
not
apply
to
natives
or
else
that
he
was
a
very
fearless
man
willing
to
take
the
risk
from
which
he
would
save
me
a
sort
of
commercial
philanthropist
however
by
that
time
i
had
other
things
to
think
of
being
a
drummer
and
a
very
energetic
one
it
came
about
in
this
way
some
countrymen
of
mine
had
started
a
cooperative
in
jamestown
where
there
were
and
cheap
lumber
they
had
no
capital
but
just
below
was
the
oil
country
where
everybody
had
money
slathers
of
it
new
wells
gushed
every
day
and
boom
towns
were
springing
up
all
along
the
allegheny
valley
men
were
streaming
into
it
from
everywhere
and
needed
furniture
if
once
they
got
the
grip
on
that
country
reasoned
the
they
would
get
rich
quickly
with
the
rest
the
thing
was
to
get
it
to
do
that
they
needed
a
man
who
could
talk
perhaps
they
remembered
the
creation
of
the
world
the
year
before
at
all
events
they
sent
up
to
buffalo
and
asked
me
if
i
would
try
i
slammed
my
shut
and
started
for
jamestown
on
the
next
train
hours
later
saw
me
headed
for
the
oil
country
equipped
with
a
mighty
album
and
a
the
album
contained
pictures
of
the
furniture
i
had
for
sale
all
the
way
down
i
studied
the
and
when
i
reached
titusville
i
knew
to
a
cent
what
it
cost
my
employers
per
foot
to
make
ash
extension
tables
i
only
wish
they
had
known
half
as
well
my
first
customer
was
a
grumpy
old
shopkeeper
who
needed
neither
tables
nor
bedsteads
so
he
said
but
i
had
thought
it
all
over
and
made
up
my
mind
that
the
first
blow
was
half
the
battle
therefore
i
knew
better
i
pushed
my
album
under
his
nose
and
it
fell
open
at
the
extension
tables
cheap
i
said
and
rattled
off
the
price
i
saw
him
prick
up
his
ears
but
he
only
growled
that
probably
they
were
no
good
what
my
extension
tables
no
good
i
dared
him
to
try
them
and
he
gave
me
an
order
for
a
dozen
but
made
me
sign
an
agreement
that
they
were
to
be
every
way
as
represented
i
would
have
backed
my
tables
with
an
order
for
the
whole
shop
so
sure
was
i
that
they
could
not
be
beaten
the
idea
with
the
fit
of
righteous
indignation
upon
me
i
went
out
and
sold
every
other
in
titusville
a
bill
of
tables
not
one
of
them
escaped
at
night
when
i
had
sent
the
order
home
i
set
out
for
oil
city
so
as
to
lose
no
valuable
time
it
was
just
the
same
there
for
some
reason
they
were
suspicious
of
the
extension
tables
yet
they
wanted
nothing
else
i
had
to
give
ironclad
guarantees
that
they
were
as
represented
which
i
did
impatiently
enough
there
was
a
thunder
storm
raging
at
the
time
the
lightning
had
struck
a
tank
and
the
burning
oil
ran
down
a
hill
and
set
the
town
on
fire
one
end
of
it
was
burning
while
i
was
canvassing
the
other
mentally
calculating
how
many
extension
tables
would
be
needed
to
replace
those
that
were
lost
people
did
not
seem
to
have
heard
of
any
other
kind
of
furniture
in
that
country
walnut
bureaus
turned
washstands
they
passed
them
all
by
to
fall
upon
the
tables
with
shrill
demand
i
made
out
their
case
to
suit
the
facts
as
i
swept
down
through
that
region
scattering
extension
tables
right
and
left
it
was
the
excitement
i
reasoned
the
inrush
of
population
from
everywhere
probably
everybody
kept
boarders
more
every
day
had
to
extend
their
tables
to
seat
them
i
saw
a
great
opportunity
and
resolutely
grasped
it
if
it
was
tables
they
wanted
tables
it
should
be
i
let
all
the
rest
of
the
stock
go
and
threw
myself
on
the
tables
exclusively
town
after
town
i
filled
with
them
night
after
night
the
mails
groaned
under
the
heavy
orders
for
extension
tables
i
sent
north
from
allegheny
city
alone
an
order
of
a
thousand
worth
from
a
single
reputable
dealer
went
home
and
i
figured
in
my
that
night
a
commission
of
for
myself
plus
my
salary
illustration
one
end
of
the
town
was
burning
while
i
was
canvassing
the
other
i
could
know
nothing
of
the
despatches
that
were
hot
on
my
trail
ever
since
my
first
order
came
from
titusville
telling
me
to
stop
let
up
on
the
tables
come
home
anything
there
was
a
mistake
in
the
price
they
never
overtook
me
my
pace
was
too
hot
for
that
anyhow
i
doubt
if
i
would
have
paid
any
attention
to
them
i
had
my
instructions
and
was
selling
according
to
orders
business
was
good
getting
better
every
day
the
firm
wrote
to
my
customers
but
they
merely
sent
back
copies
of
the
contract
they
had
seen
my
instructions
and
they
knew
it
was
all
right
it
was
not
until
i
brought
up
my
last
penny
gone
in
rochester
near
the
ohio
line
that
the
firm
established
communication
with
me
at
last
their
instructions
were
brief
to
come
home
and
sell
no
more
tables
they
sent
but
gave
me
no
clew
to
their
curious
decision
with
things
booming
as
they
were
being
in
the
field
i
considered
that
whatever
was
up
i
had
a
better
command
of
the
situation
i
decided
that
i
would
not
go
home
at
least
not
until
i
had
sold
a
few
more
extension
tables
while
they
were
in
such
demand
i
made
that
go
farther
than
ever
went
before
it
took
me
a
little
way
into
ohio
to
youngstown
and
then
back
to
pennsylvania
to
warren
and
meadville
and
corry
my
previous
training
in
going
hungry
for
days
came
in
handy
at
last
in
the
interests
of
commerce
i
let
my
dinners
go
so
i
was
enabled
to
make
a
final
dash
to
erie
where
i
planted
my
last
batch
of
tables
before
i
went
home
happy
i
got
home
in
time
to
assist
in
the
winding
up
of
the
concern
the
contracts
had
done
the
business
my
customers
would
not
listen
to
explanations
when
told
that
the
price
of
those
tables
was
lower
than
the
cost
of
working
up
the
wood
they
replied
that
it
was
none
of
their
business
they
had
their
contracts
the
allegheny
man
threatened
suit
if
i
remember
rightly
and
the
firm
gave
up
nobody
blamed
me
for
i
had
sold
according
to
orders
but
instead
of
which
i
had
figured
out
as
my
commission
i
got
cents
it
was
half
of
what
my
employer
had
he
divided
squarely
and
i
could
not
in
reason
complain
i
sat
in
the
restaurant
where
he
had
explained
the
situation
to
me
and
tried
to
telescope
my
ambitions
down
to
the
standard
when
my
eyes
fell
upon
a
copy
of
that
lay
on
the
table
i
read
an
advertisement
in
small
type
spelling
it
over
idly
while
i
was
trying
to
think
what
to
do
next
wanted
it
read
by
the
myers
manufacturing
company
agents
to
sell
a
patent
flat
and
fluting
iron
samples
cents
the
address
was
somewhere
in
john
street
new
york
samples
cents
i
repeated
it
mechanically
why
that
was
just
the
size
of
my
pile
and
right
in
my
line
of
canvassing
too
in
ten
minutes
it
was
on
the
way
to
new
york
and
i
had
secured
a
provisional
customer
in
the
cook
at
the
restaurant
for
an
iron
that
would
perform
what
this
one
promised
iron
the
skirt
and
flute
the
flounce
too
in
three
days
the
iron
came
and
proved
good
i
started
in
canvassing
jamestown
with
it
and
in
a
week
had
secured
orders
for
one
hundred
and
twenty
upon
which
my
profit
would
be
over
something
of
business
ways
must
have
stuck
to
me
after
all
from
my
one
excursion
into
the
realm
of
trade
for
when
it
came
to
delivering
the
goods
and
i
had
no
money
i
went
boldly
to
a
business
man
whose
wife
was
on
my
books
and
offered
if
he
would
send
for
the
irons
to
pay
for
them
as
i
took
them
out
of
the
store
he
made
no
bones
about
it
but
sent
for
the
irons
and
handed
them
over
to
me
to
pay
for
when
i
could
so
men
are
made
commercial
character
as
it
is
rated
on
i
had
none
before
that
but
i
had
after
how
could
i
disappoint
a
man
like
that
illustration
i
went
to
hear
horace
greeley
address
an
meeting
the
confidence
of
the
community
i
had
not
lost
through
my
too
successful
trip
as
a
drummer
at
all
events
propositions
came
speedily
to
me
to
travel
in
pianos
and
pumps
for
local
concerns
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
an
old
schoolmate
who
had
been
ordained
a
clergyman
wrote
to
me
from
denmark
to
find
him
a
charge
among
the
danish
settlements
out
west
but
neither
pumps
pianos
nor
parsons
had
power
to
swerve
me
from
my
chosen
course
with
them
went
bosses
and
orders
with
the
cherished
independence
when
i
had
sold
out
jamestown
i
made
a
for
pittsburg
a
city
that
had
taken
my
fancy
because
of
its
brisk
business
ways
they
were
brisk
indeed
grant
second
campaign
for
the
presidency
was
in
full
swing
on
my
second
night
in
town
i
went
to
hear
horace
greeley
address
an
meeting
i
can
see
his
noble
old
head
yet
above
the
crowd
and
hear
his
opening
appeal
farther
i
never
got
a
marching
band
of
uniformed
shouters
for
grant
had
cut
right
through
the
crowd
as
it
passed
i
felt
myself
suddenly
seized
an
oilcloth
cape
was
thrown
over
my
head
a
campaign
cap
jammed
after
and
i
found
myself
marching
away
with
a
torch
on
my
shoulder
to
the
tune
of
a
brass
band
just
ahead
how
many
others
of
hearers
fared
as
i
did
i
do
not
know
the
thing
seemed
so
ludicrous
and
if
i
must
march
i
really
cared
very
little
whether
it
was
for
greeley
or
grant
that
i
stuck
it
out
hoping
as
we
went
to
come
somewhere
upon
my
hat
which
had
been
lost
in
the
sudden
attack
but
i
never
saw
it
again
speaking
of
parading
my
old
desire
to
roam
that
kept
cropping
out
at
intervals
paid
me
a
characteristic
trick
at
this
time
i
was
passing
through
a
when
i
saw
a
shapely
young
horse
put
up
at
what
seemed
a
ridiculously
low
price
eighteen
dollars
was
the
bid
and
it
was
about
to
be
knocked
down
at
that
the
october
sun
was
shining
warm
and
bright
a
sudden
desire
to
get
on
the
horse
and
ride
out
into
the
wide
world
away
from
the
city
and
the
haunts
of
men
never
to
come
back
seized
me
i
raised
the
bid
to
almost
before
i
knew
the
beast
was
knocked
down
to
me
and
i
had
paid
over
the
money
it
left
me
with
exactly
to
my
name
leading
the
animal
by
the
halter
i
went
down
the
street
and
sat
on
the
stoop
of
the
robinson
house
to
think
with
every
step
perplexities
i
had
thought
of
sprang
up
in
the
first
place
i
could
not
ride
i
had
always
wanted
to
but
had
never
learned
even
if
i
had
been
able
to
where
was
i
going
and
to
do
what
i
ride
around
and
sell
the
wide
world
seemed
suddenly
a
cold
and
place
and
but
small
backing
in
an
attack
upon
it
with
a
hungry
horse
waiting
to
be
fed
that
was
only
too
evident
illustration
the
wide
world
seemed
suddenly
a
cold
and
place
the
beast
was
tearing
the
with
its
teeth
in
a
way
that
brooked
no
delay
evidently
it
had
a
healthy
appetite
the
conclusion
was
slowly
dawning
upon
me
that
i
had
made
a
fool
of
myself
when
the
man
who
had
bid
came
by
and
saw
me
sitting
there
he
stopped
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
and
i
told
him
frankly
he
roared
and
gave
me
for
the
beast
i
was
glad
enough
to
give
it
up
i
never
owned
a
horse
before
or
since
and
i
had
that
less
than
fifteen
minutes
but
it
was
the
longest
quarter
of
an
hour
since
i
worked
in
the
the
did
not
go
in
pittsburg
it
was
too
cheap
during
a
brief
interval
i
peddled
campaign
books
but
shortly
found
a
more
expensive
iron
and
had
five
counties
in
western
pennsylvania
allotted
to
me
as
territory
there
followed
a
winter
of
great
business
before
it
was
half
over
i
had
achieved
a
bank
account
though
how
i
managed
it
is
a
mystery
to
me
till
this
day
simple
as
the
reckoning
of
my
daily
trade
ought
to
be
by
no
chance
could
i
ever
make
it
foot
up
as
it
should
i
tried
honestly
every
night
but
the
receipts
would
never
square
with
the
expenditures
do
what
i
might
i
kept
them
carefully
apart
in
different
pockets
but
mixed
they
would
get
in
spite
of
all
i
had
to
call
it
square
however
far
the
footing
was
out
of
the
way
or
sit
up
all
night
which
i
would
not
do
i
remember
well
the
only
time
i
came
out
even
i
was
so
astonished
that
i
would
not
believe
it
but
had
to
go
all
over
the
account
again
that
night
i
slept
the
sleep
of
the
just
the
next
morning
when
i
was
starting
out
on
my
route
with
a
clean
conscience
and
a
clean
slate
a
shopkeeper
rapped
on
his
window
as
i
went
by
to
tell
me
that
i
had
given
him
the
previous
day
a
bill
for
a
ten
in
making
change
after
that
i
gave
up
trying
i
was
no
longer
alone
from
buffalo
my
old
chum
ronne
had
come
hearing
that
i
was
doing
well
to
join
me
and
from
denmark
an
old
schoolfellow
whose
life
at
had
been
wrecked
by
drink
and
who
wrote
begging
to
be
allowed
to
come
his
mother
pleaded
for
him
too
but
it
was
not
needed
he
had
enclosed
in
his
letter
the
strongest
talisman
of
all
a
letter
written
by
elizabeth
in
the
long
ago
when
we
were
children
together
i
have
it
yet
he
came
and
i
tried
hard
to
break
him
of
his
failing
but
i
had
undertaken
a
job
that
was
too
big
for
me
upon
my
return
from
a
western
trip
i
found
that
he
had
taken
to
drinking
again
and
in
his
cups
had
enlisted
his
curse
followed
him
into
the
army
he
rose
to
the
rank
of
sergeant
only
to
fall
again
and
suffer
degradation
the
other
day
he
shot
himself
at
the
post
where
he
was
stationed
after
nearly
thirty
years
of
service
yet
in
all
his
ups
and
downs
he
never
forgot
his
home
while
his
mother
lived
he
helped
support
her
in
denmark
and
when
she
was
gone
no
month
passed
that
he
did
not
send
home
the
half
of
his
wages
for
the
support
of
his
crippled
sister
in
the
old
town
charles
was
not
bad
he
was
a
poor
helpless
unhappy
boy
who
came
to
me
for
help
and
i
had
none
to
give
god
pity
him
and
me
the
western
trip
i
spoke
of
was
my
undoing
puffed
up
by
my
success
as
a
salesman
i
yielded
in
an
evil
hour
to
the
blandishments
of
my
manufacturers
and
accepted
the
general
agency
of
the
state
of
illinois
with
headquarters
in
chicago
it
sounded
well
but
it
did
not
work
well
chicago
had
not
yet
got
upon
its
feet
after
the
great
fire
and
its
young
men
were
too
sharp
for
me
in
six
weeks
they
had
cleaned
me
out
bodily
had
run
away
with
my
irons
and
with
money
they
borrowed
of
me
to
start
them
in
business
i
returned
to
pittsburg
as
poor
as
ever
to
find
that
the
agents
i
had
left
behind
in
my
pennsylvania
territory
had
dealt
with
me
after
the
same
fashion
the
firm
for
which
i
worked
had
connived
at
the
frauds
my
friends
had
left
me
the
one
i
spoke
of
was
in
the
army
ronne
had
given
up
in
discouragement
and
was
at
work
in
a
in
the
utter
wreck
of
all
my
hopes
i
was
alone
again
angry
and
sore
i
went
up
the
allegheny
river
with
no
definite
purpose
in
mind
except
to
get
away
from
everybody
i
knew
at
franklin
i
fell
ill
with
a
sneaking
fever
it
was
while
i
lay
helpless
in
a
lonely
tavern
by
the
riverside
that
the
crushing
blow
fell
letters
from
home
sent
on
from
pittsburg
told
me
that
elizabeth
was
to
be
married
a
cavalry
officer
who
was
in
charge
of
the
border
police
a
dashing
fellow
and
a
good
soldier
had
won
her
heart
the
wedding
was
to
be
in
the
summer
it
was
then
the
last
week
in
april
at
the
thought
i
turned
my
face
to
the
wall
and
hoped
that
i
might
die
but
one
does
not
die
of
love
at
the
days
that
passed
slowly
saw
me
leave
my
and
limp
down
to
the
river
on
sunny
days
to
sit
and
watch
the
stream
listlessly
for
hours
hoping
nothing
grasping
nothing
except
that
it
was
all
over
in
all
my
misadventures
that
was
the
one
thing
i
had
never
dreamed
of
if
i
did
i
as
quickly
banished
the
thought
as
preposterous
that
she
should
be
another
bride
seemed
so
utterly
impossible
that
sick
and
feeble
as
i
was
i
laughed
it
to
scorn
even
then
whereat
i
fell
to
reading
the
fatal
letter
again
and
trying
to
grasp
its
meaning
it
made
it
all
only
the
more
perplexing
that
i
should
not
know
who
he
was
or
what
he
was
i
had
never
heard
of
him
before
in
that
town
where
i
thought
i
knew
every
living
soul
that
he
must
be
a
noble
fellow
i
knew
or
he
could
not
have
won
her
but
who
why
what
what
had
come
over
everything
in
such
a
short
time
and
what
was
this
ugly
dream
that
was
setting
my
brain
awhirl
and
shutting
out
the
sunlight
and
the
day
presently
i
was
in
a
relapse
and
it
was
all
darkness
to
me
and
oblivion
when
at
last
i
got
well
enough
to
travel
i
set
my
face
toward
the
east
and
journeyed
on
foot
through
the
northern
coal
regions
of
pennsylvania
by
slow
stages
caring
little
whither
i
went
and
earning
just
enough
by
peddling
to
pay
my
way
it
was
spring
when
i
started
the
autumn
tints
were
on
the
leaves
when
i
brought
up
in
new
york
at
last
as
nearly
restored
as
youth
and
the
long
tramp
had
power
to
do
but
the
restless
energy
that
had
made
of
me
a
successful
salesman
was
gone
i
thought
only
if
i
thought
at
all
of
finding
some
quiet
place
where
i
could
sit
and
see
the
world
go
by
that
concerned
me
no
longer
with
a
dim
idea
of
being
sent
into
the
farthest
wilds
as
an
operator
i
went
to
a
business
college
on
fourth
avenue
and
paid
to
learn
telegraphing
it
was
the
last
money
i
had
i
attended
the
school
in
the
afternoon
in
the
morning
i
peddled
earning
money
for
my
board
and
so
made
out
one
day
while
i
was
so
occupied
i
saw
among
the
want
advertisements
in
a
newspaper
one
offering
the
position
of
city
editor
on
a
long
island
city
weekly
to
a
competent
man
something
of
my
old
ambition
stirred
within
me
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
city
editors
were
not
usually
obtained
by
advertising
still
less
that
i
was
not
competent
having
only
the
vaguest
notions
of
what
the
functions
of
a
city
editor
might
be
i
applied
for
the
job
and
got
it
at
once
eight
dollars
a
week
was
to
be
my
salary
my
job
to
fill
the
local
column
and
attend
to
the
affairs
of
hunter
point
and
blissville
generally
politics
excluded
the
editor
attended
to
that
in
hours
i
was
hard
at
work
writing
up
my
then
most
bailiwick
it
is
none
too
fine
yet
but
in
those
days
when
every
nuisance
crowded
out
of
new
york
found
refuge
there
it
stunk
to
heaven
certainly
i
had
entered
journalism
by
the
back
door
very
far
back
at
that
when
i
joined
the
staff
of
the
signs
of
that
appeared
speedily
and
multiplied
day
by
day
on
the
third
day
of
my
employment
i
beheld
the
being
thrashed
down
the
street
by
an
irate
coachman
whom
he
had
offended
and
when
in
a
spirit
of
loyalty
i
would
have
cast
in
my
lot
with
him
i
was
held
back
by
one
of
the
printers
with
the
laughing
comment
that
that
was
his
daily
diet
and
that
it
was
good
for
him
that
was
the
only
way
any
one
ever
got
any
satisfaction
or
anything
else
out
of
him
judging
from
the
goings
on
about
the
office
in
the
two
weeks
i
was
there
he
must
have
been
extensively
in
debt
to
all
sorts
of
people
who
were
trying
to
collect
when
on
my
second
deferred
i
met
him
on
the
stairs
propelled
by
his
washerwoman
who
brought
her
basket
down
on
his
head
with
every
step
he
took
calling
upon
the
populace
the
stairs
were
outside
the
building
to
witness
just
punishment
meted
out
to
him
for
failing
to
pay
for
the
washing
of
his
shirts
i
rightly
concluded
that
the
city
editor
claim
stood
no
show
i
left
him
owing
me
two
weeks
pay
but
i
freely
forgive
him
i
think
i
got
my
money
worth
of
experience
i
did
not
let
grass
grow
under
my
feet
as
city
editor
hunter
point
had
received
for
once
a
thorough
raking
over
and
i
my
first
lesson
in
hunting
the
elusive
item
and
when
found
making
a
note
of
it
except
for
a
newfoundland
pup
which
some
one
had
given
me
i
went
back
over
the
river
as
poor
as
i
had
come
the
dog
proved
rather
a
doubtful
possession
as
the
days
went
by
its
appetite
was
tremendous
and
its
preference
for
my
society
embarrassingly
unrestrained
it
would
not
be
content
to
sleep
anywhere
else
than
in
my
room
if
i
put
it
out
in
the
yard
it
forthwith
organized
a
search
for
me
in
which
the
entire
neighborhood
was
compelled
to
take
part
its
manner
of
doing
it
boomed
the
local
trade
in
and
mantel
but
brought
on
complications
with
the
landlord
in
the
morning
that
usually
resulted
in
the
departure
of
bob
and
myself
for
other
pastures
part
with
him
i
could
not
for
bob
loved
me
once
i
tried
when
it
seemed
that
there
was
no
choice
i
had
been
put
out
for
perhaps
the
tenth
time
and
i
had
no
more
money
left
to
provide
for
our
keep
a
wall
street
broker
had
advertised
for
a
and
i
went
with
bob
to
see
him
but
when
he
would
have
counted
the
three
gold
pieces
he
offered
into
my
hand
i
saw
bob
honest
brown
eyes
watching
me
with
a
look
of
such
faithful
affection
that
i
dropped
the
coins
as
if
they
burned
and
caught
him
about
the
neck
to
tell
him
that
we
would
never
part
bob
put
his
huge
paws
on
my
shoulders
licked
my
face
and
barked
such
a
joyous
bark
of
challenge
to
the
world
in
general
that
even
the
wall
street
man
was
touched
i
guess
you
are
too
good
friends
to
part
he
said
and
so
we
were
we
left
wall
street
and
its
gold
behind
to
go
out
and
starve
together
literally
we
did
that
in
the
days
that
followed
i
had
taken
to
peddling
books
an
illustrated
dickens
issued
by
the
harpers
but
i
barely
earned
enough
by
it
to
keep
life
in
us
and
a
transient
roof
over
our
heads
i
call
it
transient
because
it
was
rarely
the
same
two
nights
together
for
causes
which
i
have
explained
in
the
day
bob
made
out
rather
better
than
i
he
could
always
coax
a
supper
out
of
the
servant
at
the
basement
gate
by
his
curvetings
and
tricks
while
i
pleaded
vainly
and
hungrily
with
the
mistress
at
the
front
door
dickens
was
a
drug
in
the
market
a
curious
fatality
had
given
me
a
copy
of
hard
times
to
canvass
with
i
think
no
amount
of
good
fortune
could
turn
my
head
while
it
stands
in
my
bookcase
one
look
at
it
brings
back
too
vividly
that
day
when
bob
and
i
had
gone
desperate
and
breakfastless
from
the
last
bed
we
might
know
for
many
days
to
try
to
sell
it
and
so
get
the
means
to
keep
us
for
another
hours
it
was
not
only
breakfast
we
lacked
the
day
before
we
had
had
only
a
crust
together
two
days
without
food
is
not
good
preparation
for
a
day
canvassing
we
did
the
best
we
could
bob
stood
by
and
wagged
his
tail
persuasively
while
i
did
the
talking
but
luck
was
dead
against
us
and
hard
times
stuck
to
us
for
all
we
tried
evening
came
and
found
us
down
by
the
cooper
institute
with
never
a
cent
faint
with
hunger
i
sat
down
on
the
steps
under
the
illuminated
clock
while
bob
stretched
himself
at
my
feet
he
had
beguiled
the
cook
in
one
of
the
last
houses
we
called
at
and
his
stomach
was
filled
from
the
corner
i
had
looked
on
enviously
for
me
there
was
no
supper
as
there
had
been
no
dinner
and
no
breakfast
tomorrow
there
was
another
day
of
starvation
how
long
was
this
to
last
was
it
any
use
to
keep
up
a
struggle
so
hopeless
from
this
very
spot
i
had
gone
hungry
and
wrathful
three
years
before
when
the
dining
frenchmen
for
whom
i
wanted
to
fight
thrust
me
forth
from
their
company
three
wasted
years
then
i
had
one
cent
in
my
pocket
i
remembered
today
i
had
not
even
so
much
i
was
bankrupt
in
hope
and
purpose
nothing
had
gone
right
nothing
would
ever
go
right
and
worse
i
did
not
care
i
drummed
moodily
upon
my
book
wasted
yes
my
life
was
wasted
utterly
wasted
illustration
hard
times
a
voice
hailed
me
by
name
and
bob
sat
up
looking
attentively
at
me
for
his
cue
as
to
the
treatment
of
the
owner
of
it
i
recognized
in
him
the
principal
of
the
telegraph
school
where
i
had
gone
until
my
money
gave
out
he
seemed
suddenly
struck
by
something
why
what
are
you
doing
here
he
asked
i
told
him
bob
and
i
were
just
resting
after
a
day
of
canvassing
books
he
snorted
i
guess
they
wo
make
you
rich
now
how
would
you
like
to
be
a
reporter
if
you
have
got
nothing
better
to
do
the
manager
of
a
news
agency
down
town
asked
me
to
find
him
a
bright
young
fellow
whom
he
could
break
in
it
much
a
week
to
start
with
but
it
is
better
than
peddling
books
i
know
he
poked
over
the
book
in
my
hand
and
read
the
title
hard
times
he
said
with
a
little
laugh
i
guess
so
what
do
you
say
i
think
you
will
do
better
come
along
and
let
me
give
you
a
note
to
him
now
as
in
a
dream
i
walked
across
the
street
with
him
to
his
office
and
got
the
letter
which
was
to
make
me
and
homeless
rich
as
crusus
it
seemed
to
me
bob
went
along
and
before
i
departed
from
the
school
a
better
home
than
i
could
give
him
was
found
for
him
with
my
benefactor
i
was
to
bring
him
the
next
day
i
had
to
admit
that
it
was
best
so
that
night
the
last
which
bob
and
i
spent
together
we
walked
up
and
down
broadway
where
there
was
quiet
thinking
it
over
what
had
happened
had
stirred
me
profoundly
for
the
second
time
i
saw
a
hand
held
out
to
save
me
from
wreck
just
when
it
seemed
inevitable
and
i
knew
it
for
his
hand
to
whose
will
i
was
at
last
beginning
to
bow
in
humility
that
had
been
a
stranger
to
me
before
it
had
ever
been
my
own
will
my
own
way
upon
which
i
insisted
in
the
shadow
of
grace
church
i
bowed
my
head
against
the
granite
wall
of
the
gray
tower
and
prayed
for
strength
to
do
the
work
which
i
had
so
long
and
arduously
sought
and
which
had
now
come
to
me
the
while
bob
sat
and
looked
on
saying
clearly
enough
with
his
wagging
tail
that
he
did
not
know
what
was
going
on
but
that
he
was
sure
it
was
all
right
then
we
resumed
our
wanderings
one
thought
and
only
one
i
had
room
for
i
did
not
pursue
it
it
walked
with
me
wherever
i
went
she
was
not
married
yet
not
yet
when
the
sun
rose
i
washed
my
face
and
hands
in
a
dog
pulled
my
clothes
into
such
shape
as
i
could
and
went
with
bob
to
his
new
home
that
parting
over
i
walked
down
to
park
row
and
delivered
my
letter
to
the
desk
editor
in
the
new
york
news
association
up
on
the
top
floor
he
looked
me
over
a
little
doubtfully
but
evidently
impressed
with
the
early
hours
i
kept
told
me
that
i
might
try
he
waved
me
to
a
desk
bidding
me
wait
until
he
had
made
out
his
morning
book
of
assignments
and
with
such
scant
ceremony
was
i
finally
introduced
to
newspaper
row
that
had
been
to
me
like
an
enchanted
land
after
years
of
hard
work
in
it
during
which
i
have
been
behind
the
scenes
of
most
of
the
plays
that
go
to
make
up
the
sum
of
the
life
of
the
metropolis
it
exercises
the
old
spell
over
me
yet
if
my
sympathies
need
quickening
my
point
of
view
adjusting
i
have
only
to
go
down
to
park
row
at
eventide
when
the
crowds
are
hurrying
homeward
and
the
city
hall
clock
is
lighted
particularly
when
the
snow
lies
on
the
grass
in
the
park
and
stand
watching
them
awhile
to
find
all
things
coming
right
it
is
bob
who
stands
by
and
watches
with
me
then
as
on
that
night
the
assignment
that
fell
to
my
lot
when
the
book
was
made
out
the
first
against
which
my
name
was
written
in
a
new
york
book
was
a
lunch
of
some
sort
at
the
astor
house
i
have
forgotten
what
was
the
special
occasion
i
remember
the
bearskin
hats
of
the
old
guard
in
it
but
little
else
in
a
kind
of
haze
i
beheld
half
the
savory
viands
of
earth
spread
under
the
eyes
and
nostrils
of
a
man
who
had
not
tasted
food
for
the
third
day
i
did
not
ask
for
any
i
had
reached
that
stage
of
starvation
that
is
like
the
still
centre
of
a
cyclone
when
no
hunger
is
felt
but
it
may
be
that
a
touch
of
it
all
crept
into
my
report
for
when
the
editor
had
read
it
he
said
briefly
you
will
do
take
that
desk
and
report
at
ten
every
morning
sharp
that
night
when
i
was
dismissed
from
the
office
i
went
up
the
bowery
to
no
where
a
danish
family
kept
a
up
under
the
roof
i
had
work
and
wages
now
and
could
pay
on
the
stairs
i
fell
in
a
swoon
and
lay
there
till
some
one
stumbled
over
me
in
the
dark
and
carried
me
in
my
strength
had
at
last
given
out
so
began
my
life
as
a
newspaper
man
chapter
vi
in
which
i
become
an
editor
and
receive
my
first
love
letter
i
had
my
hands
full
that
winter
the
profession
i
had
entered
by
so
thorny
a
path
did
not
prove
to
be
a
bed
of
roses
but
i
was
not
looking
for
roses
i
doubt
if
i
would
have
known
what
to
do
with
them
had
there
been
any
hard
work
and
hard
knocks
had
been
my
portion
heretofore
and
i
was
fairly
trained
down
to
that
besides
now
that
the
question
where
the
next
meal
was
to
come
from
did
not
loom
up
whichever
way
i
looked
the
thing
for
me
was
to
be
at
work
hard
enough
and
long
enough
to
keep
from
thinking
with
every
letter
from
home
i
expected
to
hear
that
she
was
married
and
then
i
never
got
any
farther
a
furious
kind
of
energy
took
possession
of
me
at
the
mere
idea
and
i
threw
myself
upon
my
work
in
a
way
that
speedily
earned
for
me
the
name
of
a
good
reporter
good
had
reference
to
the
quantity
of
work
done
rather
than
to
the
quality
of
it
that
was
of
less
account
than
our
ability
to
get
around
to
our
assignments
necessarily
so
for
we
mostly
had
six
or
seven
of
an
evening
to
attend
our
route
extending
often
from
harlem
clear
down
to
the
bowery
so
that
they
were
nearly
on
a
line
we
were
supposed
to
have
no
cause
of
complaint
our
office
sold
news
to
morning
and
evening
papers
both
and
our
working
day
which
began
at
was
seldom
over
until
one
or
two
the
next
morning
three
reporters
had
to
attend
to
all
the
general
news
of
the
city
that
did
not
come
through
the
regular
department
channels
a
queerly
assorted
trio
we
were
doc
lynch
who
had
graduated
from
the
medical
school
to
bohemia
following
a
natural
bent
i
suppose
crafts
a
maine
boy
of
angular
frame
and
prodigious
and
myself
lynch
i
have
lost
sight
of
long
ago
crafts
i
am
told
is
rich
and
prosperous
the
owner
of
a
western
newspaper
that
was
bound
to
happen
to
him
i
remember
him
in
the
darkest
days
of
that
winter
when
to
small
pay
hard
work
and
long
hours
had
been
added
an
attack
of
measles
that
kept
him
in
bed
in
his
desolate
far
from
kindred
and
friends
doc
and
i
had
run
in
on
a
stolen
visit
to
fill
their
place
as
well
as
we
might
we
sat
around
trying
to
look
as
cheerful
as
we
could
and
succeeding
very
poorly
but
crafts
belief
in
himself
and
his
star
soared
above
any
trivialities
of
present
discouragement
i
see
him
now
rising
on
his
elbow
and
transfixing
the
two
of
us
with
long
prophetic
forefinger
the
secret
of
my
success
he
said
impressively
i
lay
to
we
never
found
out
to
what
he
laid
it
for
we
both
burst
out
laughing
and
crafts
after
a
passing
look
of
surprise
joined
in
but
that
finger
prophesied
truly
his
pluck
won
the
day
and
won
it
fairly
they
were
two
good
comrades
in
a
tight
place
i
should
want
any
better
running
around
was
only
working
off
steam
of
which
we
had
plenty
the
long
rides
on
harlem
assignments
in
with
straw
in
the
bottom
that
did
keep
our
feet
from
freezing
until
all
feeling
in
them
was
gone
were
worse
a
good
deal
at
the
mere
thought
of
them
i
fall
to
nursing
my
toes
for
reminiscent
pangs
however
i
had
at
least
enough
to
eat
at
the
downtown
and
the
other
swell
restaurants
through
the
windows
of
which
i
had
so
often
gazed
with
hungry
eyes
i
now
sometimes
sat
at
big
spreads
and
public
dinners
never
without
thinking
of
the
old
days
and
the
poor
fellows
who
might
then
be
having
my
hard
luck
it
was
not
so
long
since
that
i
could
have
forgotten
i
bit
a
mark
in
the
mulberry
bend
too
as
my
professional
engagements
took
me
that
way
promising
myself
that
the
day
should
come
when
i
would
have
time
to
attend
to
it
for
the
rest
if
i
had
an
hour
to
spare
i
put
it
in
at
the
telegraph
instrument
i
had
still
the
notion
that
it
might
not
be
labor
lost
and
though
i
never
had
professional
use
for
it
it
did
come
handy
to
me
as
a
reporter
more
than
once
there
is
scarcely
anything
one
can
learn
that
will
not
sooner
or
later
be
useful
to
a
newspaper
man
if
he
is
himself
of
the
kind
that
wants
to
be
useful
along
in
the
spring
some
politicians
in
south
brooklyn
who
had
started
a
weekly
newspaper
to
boom
their
own
fortunes
found
themselves
in
need
of
a
reporter
and
were
told
of
a
young
dutchman
who
might
make
things
go
i
was
that
dutchman
they
offered
me
a
week
and
on
may
i
carried
my
grip
across
the
river
and
all
unconscious
that
i
was
on
the
turning
tide
in
my
fortunes
cast
in
my
lot
with
beecher
crowd
as
the
boys
in
the
office
said
derisively
when
i
left
them
in
two
weeks
i
was
the
editor
of
the
paper
that
was
not
a
vote
of
confidence
but
pure
economy
on
the
part
of
my
owners
they
saved
forty
dollars
a
week
by
giving
me
and
the
name
of
editor
the
idea
of
an
editor
in
anything
but
the
name
i
do
not
suppose
had
ever
entered
their
minds
theirs
was
an
organ
and
for
the
purposes
for
which
they
had
started
it
they
thought
themselves
abundantly
able
to
run
it
i
on
my
part
quickly
grew
high
notions
of
editorial
independence
their
purposes
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
two
views
proved
irreconcilable
they
clashed
quite
regularly
and
perhaps
it
was
as
much
that
they
were
tired
of
the
editor
as
that
the
paper
was
a
drag
upon
them
that
made
them
throw
it
up
after
the
fall
elections
in
which
they
won
the
press
and
the
engine
were
seized
for
debt
the
last
issue
of
the
brooklyn
had
been
put
upon
the
street
and
i
went
to
the
city
to
make
a
bargain
with
the
foundryman
for
the
type
it
was
in
the
closing
days
of
the
year
christmas
was
at
the
door
with
its
memories
tired
and
disheartened
i
was
on
my
way
back
my
business
done
as
the
bells
rang
in
the
holy
eve
i
stood
at
the
bow
of
a
fulton
street
ferryboat
listening
sadly
to
them
and
watched
the
lights
of
the
city
kindling
alongshore
of
them
all
not
one
was
for
me
it
was
all
over
and
i
should
have
to
strike
a
new
trail
where
would
that
lead
what
did
it
matter
anyhow
nobody
cared
why
should
i
a
beautiful
meteor
shot
out
of
the
heavens
overhead
and
spanned
the
river
with
a
shining
arc
i
watched
it
sail
slowly
over
williamsburg
its
trail
glowing
bright
against
the
dark
sky
and
mechanically
the
old
wish
rose
to
my
lips
it
was
a
superstition
with
us
when
we
were
children
that
if
we
were
quick
enough
to
wish
out
before
the
star
was
extinguished
the
wish
would
come
true
i
had
tried
a
hundred
times
always
to
fail
but
for
once
i
had
ample
time
a
bitter
sigh
smothered
the
wish
half
uttered
my
chance
had
come
too
late
even
now
she
might
be
another
man
wife
and
i
i
had
just
made
another
failure
of
it
as
usual
it
had
never
happened
in
all
the
holiday
seasons
i
had
been
away
that
a
letter
from
home
had
reached
me
in
time
for
christmas
eve
and
it
was
a
sore
subject
with
me
for
it
was
ever
the
dearest
in
the
year
to
me
and
is
now
but
that
evening
when
i
came
home
in
a
very
ill
humor
for
the
first
time
i
found
the
coveted
letter
it
told
me
of
the
death
of
my
two
older
brothers
and
of
my
favorite
aunt
in
a
postscript
my
father
added
that
lieutenant
b
affianced
husband
had
died
in
the
city
hospital
at
copenhagen
she
herself
was
living
among
strangers
she
had
chosen
her
lover
when
the
family
demanded
of
her
that
she
give
him
up
as
a
hopeless
invalid
they
thought
it
all
for
her
good
of
her
i
should
have
expected
nothing
less
but
she
shall
tell
the
story
of
that
herself
i
read
the
letter
through
then
lay
down
upon
my
bed
and
wept
when
i
arose
it
was
to
go
to
the
owners
of
my
paper
with
a
proposition
to
buy
it
they
laughed
at
me
at
first
asked
to
see
my
money
as
a
reporter
for
the
news
bureau
i
had
saved
up
rather
because
i
had
no
time
to
spend
it
than
with
any
definite
notion
of
what
i
was
going
to
do
with
it
this
i
offered
to
them
and
pointed
out
that
the
sale
of
the
old
type
which
was
all
that
was
left
of
the
paper
beside
the
goodwill
would
bring
no
more
one
of
them
more
reasonable
than
the
rest
the
one
who
had
generally
paid
the
scores
while
the
others
took
the
tricks
was
disposed
to
listen
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
i
bought
the
paper
for
giving
notes
for
the
rest
to
be
paid
when
i
could
if
i
could
not
they
were
not
much
out
and
then
again
i
might
succeed
i
did
by
what
effort
i
hesitate
to
set
down
here
lest
i
be
not
believed
the
was
a
big
sheet
literally
every
word
in
it
i
wrote
myself
i
was
my
own
editor
reporter
publisher
and
advertising
agent
my
pen
kept
two
printers
busy
all
the
week
and
left
me
time
to
canvass
for
advertisements
attend
meetings
and
gather
the
news
friday
night
the
local
undertaker
who
advertised
in
the
paper
and
paid
in
kind
took
the
forms
over
to
new
york
where
the
presswork
was
done
in
the
early
morning
hours
i
shouldered
the
edition
it
was
not
very
large
in
those
days
and
carried
it
from
spruce
street
down
to
fulton
ferry
and
then
home
on
a
fifth
avenue
car
i
recall
with
what
inward
rage
i
submitted
to
being
held
up
by
every
chance
policeman
and
prodded
facetiously
in
the
ribs
with
remarks
about
the
old
man
millions
etc
once
or
twice
it
boiled
over
and
i
was
threatened
with
summary
arrest
when
i
got
home
i
slept
on
the
counter
with
the
edition
for
my
pillow
in
order
to
be
up
with
the
first
gleam
of
daylight
to
skirmish
for
newsboys
i
gathered
them
in
from
street
and
avenue
compelled
them
to
come
in
if
they
were
not
willing
and
made
such
inducements
for
them
that
shortly
south
brooklyn
resounded
with
the
cry
of
news
from
sunrise
to
sunset
on
saturday
the
politicians
who
had
been
laughing
at
my
weekly
funeral
beheld
with
amazement
the
paper
thrust
under
their
noses
at
every
step
they
heard
its
praises
or
the
other
thing
sung
on
every
hand
from
their
point
of
view
it
was
the
same
thing
the
paper
was
talked
of
their
utmost
effort
had
failed
of
that
when
on
june
her
birthday
i
paid
down
in
hard
cash
what
was
left
of
the
purchase
sum
and
hoisted
the
flag
over
an
independent
newspaper
freed
from
debt
they
came
around
with
honeyed
speeches
to
make
friends
i
scarcely
heard
them
deep
down
in
my
soul
a
voice
kept
repeating
unceasingly
elizabeth
is
free
she
is
free
free
that
night
in
the
seclusion
of
my
den
clutching
grimly
the
ladder
upon
which
i
had
at
last
got
my
feet
i
resolved
that
i
would
reach
the
top
or
die
climbing
and
found
me
sleepless
pouring
out
my
heart
to
her
four
thousand
miles
away
i
carried
the
letter
to
the
myself
and
waited
till
i
saw
it
started
on
its
long
journey
i
stood
watching
the
carrier
till
he
turned
the
corner
then
went
back
to
my
work
to
that
work
there
had
been
added
a
fresh
spur
just
when
i
was
at
last
free
from
all
trammels
the
other
strongest
of
human
emotions
had
been
stirred
within
me
in
a
methodist
revival
it
was
in
the
old
eighteenth
street
church
i
had
fallen
under
the
spell
of
the
preacher
fiery
eloquence
brother
simmons
was
of
the
old
stock
albeit
their
day
was
long
past
in
our
staid
community
he
had
all
their
power
for
the
spirit
burned
within
him
and
he
brought
me
to
the
altar
quickly
though
in
my
own
case
conversion
refused
to
work
the
prescribed
amount
of
agony
perhaps
it
was
because
i
had
heard
beecher
question
the
correctness
of
the
prescription
when
a
man
travelling
in
the
road
found
out
he
said
that
he
had
gone
wrong
he
did
not
usually
roll
in
the
dust
and
agonize
over
his
mistake
he
just
turned
around
and
went
the
other
way
it
struck
me
so
but
none
the
less
with
deep
conviction
in
fact
with
the
heat
of
the
convert
i
decided
on
the
spot
to
throw
up
my
editorial
work
and
take
to
preaching
but
brother
simmons
would
not
hear
of
it
footnote
brother
simmons
the
rev
ichabod
simmons
no
no
jacob
he
said
not
that
we
have
preachers
enough
what
the
world
needs
is
consecrated
pens
then
and
there
i
consecrated
mine
i
wish
i
could
honestly
say
that
it
has
always
come
up
to
the
high
ideal
set
it
then
i
can
say
though
that
it
has
ever
striven
toward
it
and
that
scarce
a
day
has
passed
since
that
i
have
not
thought
of
the
charge
then
laid
upon
it
and
upon
me
the
immediate
result
was
a
campaign
for
reform
that
made
the
town
stare
it
struck
the
politicians
first
they
were
democrats
and
i
was
running
a
democratic
paper
i
did
it
too
for
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
scandals
of
grant
second
term
and
the
disgrace
of
it
was
foul
so
far
we
were
agreed
but
it
happened
that
the
chief
obstacle
to
democratic
success
in
the
ward
where
my
paper
was
located
was
the
police
captain
of
the
precinct
john
mackellar
who
died
the
other
day
as
deputy
chief
of
the
borough
of
brooklyn
mackellar
was
a
republican
of
a
pronounced
type
and
a
good
deal
of
a
politician
besides
therefore
he
must
go
but
he
was
my
friend
i
had
but
two
in
the
entire
neighborhood
who
really
cared
for
me
edward
wells
clerk
in
a
across
the
street
who
was
of
my
own
age
and
mackellar
between
us
had
sprung
up
a
strong
attachment
and
i
could
not
think
of
having
mackellar
removed
particularly
as
he
had
done
nothing
to
deserve
it
he
was
a
good
policeman
i
told
the
bosses
so
they
insisted
pleaded
political
expedience
i
told
them
i
would
not
allow
it
and
when
they
went
ahead
in
spite
of
me
told
the
truth
about
it
in
my
paper
the
was
really
a
republican
ward
the
attitude
of
the
killed
the
job
the
democratic
bosses
were
indignant
how
can
we
run
the
ward
with
you
acting
that
way
they
asked
i
told
them
i
did
not
care
if
they
did
i
could
run
it
better
myself
it
seemed
they
said
nothing
they
had
other
resources
the
chief
of
them
he
was
a
judge
came
around
and
had
a
friendly
talk
with
me
he
showed
me
that
i
was
going
against
my
own
interest
i
was
just
starting
out
in
life
i
had
energy
education
they
were
qualities
that
in
politics
were
convertible
into
gold
much
gold
if
i
would
but
follow
him
and
his
fortunes
i
never
had
an
education
he
said
i
need
you
if
you
will
stick
to
me
i
will
make
you
rich
i
think
he
meant
it
he
certainly
could
have
done
so
had
he
chosen
he
himself
died
rich
he
was
not
a
bad
fellow
as
bosses
go
but
i
did
not
like
boss
politics
and
the
bait
did
not
tempt
me
i
never
wanted
to
be
rich
i
am
afraid
it
would
make
me
grasping
i
think
i
am
built
that
way
anyhow
it
is
too
much
bother
i
wanted
to
run
my
own
paper
and
i
told
him
so
well
he
said
you
are
young
think
it
over
it
was
some
time
after
that
i
read
in
a
newspaper
upon
returning
from
a
hunting
trip
to
staten
island
that
i
had
been
that
day
appointed
an
interpreter
in
my
friend
the
judge
court
at
a
salary
of
a
month
i
went
to
him
and
asked
him
what
it
meant
well
he
said
we
need
an
interpreter
there
are
a
good
many
scandinavians
and
germans
in
my
district
you
know
their
language
but
i
protested
i
have
no
time
to
go
interpreting
police
court
cases
i
do
want
the
office
he
pushed
me
out
with
a
friendly
you
go
back
and
wait
till
i
send
for
you
we
can
lump
the
cases
and
we
wo
need
you
every
day
in
fact
they
did
not
need
me
more
than
two
or
three
times
that
month
at
the
end
of
which
i
drew
my
pay
with
many
qualms
of
conscience
my
services
were
certainly
not
worth
the
money
i
received
such
is
the
soothing
power
of
public
pap
on
the
second
though
i
had
performed
even
less
service
i
did
not
feel
nearly
so
bad
about
it
my
third
check
i
drew
as
a
matter
of
course
i
was
one
of
the
boys
now
and
treated
with
familiarity
by
men
whom
i
did
not
like
a
bit
and
who
i
am
sure
did
not
like
me
but
the
cordiality
did
not
long
endure
it
soon
appeared
that
the
interpreter
in
the
judge
court
had
other
duties
than
merely
to
see
justice
done
to
helpless
foreigners
among
them
to
see
things
politically
as
his
honor
did
i
did
not
a
ruction
followed
speedily
i
think
it
was
about
our
old
friend
mackellar
that
wound
up
by
his
calling
me
an
ingrate
it
was
a
favorite
word
of
his
as
i
have
noticed
it
is
of
all
bosses
and
it
meant
everything
reprehensible
he
did
not
discharge
me
he
could
i
was
as
much
a
part
of
the
court
as
he
was
having
been
appointed
under
a
state
law
but
the
power
of
the
legislature
that
had
created
me
was
invoked
to
kill
me
and
for
appearance
sake
the
office
before
it
adjourned
the
same
legislature
resurrected
the
office
but
not
me
so
contradictory
is
human
nature
that
by
that
time
i
was
quite
ready
to
fight
for
my
rights
but
for
once
i
was
outclassed
the
judge
and
the
legislature
were
too
many
for
me
and
i
retired
as
gracefully
as
i
could
so
ceased
my
career
as
a
public
officer
and
forever
it
was
the
only
office
i
ever
held
and
i
do
not
want
another
i
am
ashamed
yet
years
after
of
having
held
that
one
because
however
i
try
to
gloss
it
over
i
was
while
i
held
it
a
sinecurist
pure
and
simple
however
it
did
not
dampen
my
zeal
for
reform
in
the
least
that
encompassed
the
whole
range
of
my
little
world
nor
would
it
brook
delay
even
for
a
minute
it
did
not
consider
ways
and
means
and
was
in
nowise
tempered
with
discretion
looking
back
now
it
seems
strange
that
i
never
was
made
to
figure
in
the
police
court
in
those
days
in
another
capacity
than
that
of
interpreter
not
that
i
did
anything
for
which
i
should
have
been
rightly
jailed
but
people
will
object
to
being
dragged
by
the
hair
even
in
the
ways
of
reform
when
the
grocer
on
my
corner
complained
that
he
was
being
ruined
by
beats
who
did
not
pay
their
bills
and
thereby
compelled
him
to
charge
those
who
did
pay
more
in
order
that
he
might
live
i
started
in
at
once
to
make
those
beats
pay
up
i
gave
notice
in
a
plain
statement
of
the
case
in
my
editorial
columns
that
they
must
settle
their
scores
for
the
sake
of
the
grocer
and
the
general
good
or
i
would
publish
their
names
i
was
as
good
as
my
word
i
not
only
published
the
list
of
them
but
how
much
and
how
long
they
owed
it
and
called
upon
them
to
pay
or
move
out
of
the
ward
did
they
move
well
no
perhaps
it
was
too
much
to
expect
they
were
comfortable
they
stayed
to
poison
the
mind
of
the
town
against
the
man
who
was
lying
awake
nights
to
serve
it
in
which
laudable
effort
they
were
ably
seconded
by
the
corner
grocer
i
record
without
regret
the
subsequent
failure
of
that
tradesman
there
were
several
things
wrong
with
the
details
of
my
campaign
for
one
thing
i
had
omitted
to
include
him
among
the
beats
but
in
its
large
lines
we
can
all
agree
that
it
was
right
it
was
only
another
illustration
of
the
difficulty
of
reducing
high
preaching
to
practice
instead
of
society
hailing
me
as
its
saviour
i
grew
personally
unpopular
i
doubt
if
i
had
another
friend
in
the
world
beside
the
two
i
have
mentioned
but
the
circulation
of
my
paper
grew
enormously
it
was
doubled
and
trebled
week
by
week
a
fact
which
i
accepted
as
public
recognition
of
the
righteousness
of
my
cause
i
was
wrong
in
that
the
fact
was
that
ours
was
a
community
of
people
with
a
normally
healthy
appetite
for
knowing
one
neighbor
business
i
suppose
the
thing
has
been
mistaken
before
by
inexperience
for
moral
enthusiasm
and
will
be
again
i
must
stop
here
to
tell
the
reason
why
i
would
not
convict
the
meanest
thief
on
circumstantial
evidence
i
would
rather
let
a
thousand
go
free
than
risk
with
one
what
i
risked
and
shudder
yet
to
think
of
there
had
been
some
public
excitement
that
summer
about
mad
dogs
especially
a
good
many
persons
had
been
bitten
and
the
authorities
of
massachusetts
if
i
remember
rightly
had
put
that
particular
breed
under
the
ban
as
dangerous
at
all
times
there
was
one
always
prowling
about
the
lot
behind
my
office
through
which
the
way
led
to
my
and
when
it
snapped
at
my
leg
in
passing
one
day
i
determined
to
kill
it
in
the
interest
of
public
safety
i
sent
my
out
to
buy
a
handful
of
buckshot
and
when
he
brought
it
set
about
loading
both
barrels
of
the
that
stood
in
my
office
while
i
was
so
occupied
my
friend
the
came
in
and
wanted
to
know
what
i
was
up
to
shooting
a
dog
i
said
and
he
laughed
looks
as
though
you
were
going
gunning
for
your
beats
i
echoed
his
laugh
thoughtlessly
enough
but
the
thing
reminded
me
that
it
was
unlawful
to
shoot
within
the
city
limits
and
i
sent
the
boy
up
to
the
station
to
tell
the
captain
to
never
mind
if
he
heard
shooting
around
i
was
going
out
for
a
dog
with
that
i
went
forth
upon
my
quest
the
dog
was
there
but
he
escaped
before
i
could
get
a
shot
at
him
he
dodged
growling
and
snapping
among
the
weeds
and
at
last
ran
into
a
large
enclosed
lot
in
which
there
were
stacks
of
lumber
and
junk
and
many
i
knew
that
he
could
not
get
out
for
the
board
fence
was
high
and
tight
so
i
went
in
and
shut
the
door
after
me
and
had
him
i
should
have
said
before
that
among
my
enemies
was
a
worthless
fellow
a
of
the
local
political
machine
who
had
that
afternoon
been
in
the
office
annoying
me
with
his
loud
and
boisterous
talk
he
was
drunk
and
as
there
were
some
people
to
see
me
i
put
him
out
he
persisted
in
coming
back
and
i
finally
told
him
in
the
hearing
of
a
dozen
persons
to
go
about
his
business
or
some
serious
harm
would
befall
him
if
i
connected
any
idea
with
it
it
was
to
call
a
policeman
but
i
left
them
to
infer
something
worse
i
suppose
getting
arrested
was
not
very
serious
business
with
him
he
went
out
swearing
it
was
twilight
when
i
began
my
for
the
spitz
in
the
lumber
lot
and
the
outlines
of
things
were
more
or
less
vague
but
i
followed
the
dog
about
until
at
last
i
made
him
out
standing
on
a
pile
of
boards
a
little
way
off
it
was
my
chance
i
raised
the
gun
quickly
and
took
aim
i
had
both
barrels
cocked
and
my
finger
on
the
trigger
when
something
told
me
quite
distinctly
not
to
shoot
to
put
down
the
gun
and
go
closer
i
did
so
and
found
not
the
dog
as
i
thought
but
my
enemy
whom
i
had
threatened
but
an
hour
or
two
before
asleep
at
full
length
on
the
stack
with
his
coat
rolled
under
his
head
for
a
pillow
it
was
his
white
which
i
had
mistaken
in
the
twilight
for
the
spitz
dog
he
never
knew
of
his
peril
i
saw
my
own
at
a
glance
and
it
appalled
me
stranger
that
i
was
hated
and
denounced
by
many
who
would
have
posed
as
victims
of
my
violence
with
this
record
against
me
of
threatening
the
man
whom
i
would
be
accused
of
having
slain
an
hour
later
with
my
two
only
friends
compelled
to
give
evidence
which
would
make
me
out
as
artfully
plotting
murder
under
the
shield
of
a
palpable
invention
for
who
ever
heard
of
any
one
notifying
the
police
that
he
was
going
to
shoot
a
dog
with
no
family
connection
or
previous
good
character
to
build
a
defence
upon
where
would
have
been
my
chance
of
escape
what
stronger
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
could
have
been
woven
to
bring
me
an
innocent
man
to
the
gallows
i
have
often
wished
to
forget
that
evening
by
the
sleeping
man
in
the
lumber
lot
i
can
not
even
now
write
calmly
about
it
many
months
passed
before
i
could
persuade
myself
to
touch
my
gun
fond
as
i
had
always
been
of
carrying
it
through
the
woods
of
all
this
the
beats
knew
nothing
they
kept
up
their
warfare
of
backbiting
and
of
raising
petty
ructions
at
the
office
when
i
was
not
there
until
i
hit
upon
the
plan
of
putting
pat
in
charge
pat
was
a
typical
irish
who
would
a
sight
rather
fight
than
eat
there
was
a
coal
office
in
the
building
and
pat
was
generally
hanging
around
looking
for
a
job
i
paid
him
a
dollar
a
week
to
keep
the
office
clear
of
intruders
and
after
that
there
was
no
trouble
there
was
never
any
fighting
either
the
mere
appearance
of
pat
in
the
doorway
was
enough
to
his
great
disgust
it
was
a
success
as
far
as
preserving
the
peace
of
the
office
was
concerned
but
with
it
there
grew
up
unknown
to
me
an
impression
that
personally
i
would
not
fight
and
the
courage
of
the
beats
rose
correspondingly
they
determined
to
ambush
me
and
have
it
out
with
me
one
wintry
saturday
night
when
i
was
alone
in
the
office
closing
up
the
business
of
the
week
they
met
on
the
opposite
corner
to
see
me
get
a
thrashing
one
of
their
number
a
giant
in
stature
but
the
biggest
coward
of
the
lot
was
to
administer
it
he
was
fitted
out
with
an
immense
hickory
club
for
the
purpose
and
to
nerve
his
arm
they
filled
him
with
drink
my
office
had
a
large
window
running
the
whole
length
of
the
front
with
a
sill
that
made
a
very
good
seat
when
chairs
were
scarce
only
one
had
to
be
careful
not
to
lean
against
the
window
it
was
made
of
small
panes
set
in
a
slight
wooden
framework
which
every
strong
wind
blew
out
or
in
and
i
was
in
constant
dread
lest
the
whole
thing
should
collapse
on
that
particular
night
the
window
was
covered
with
a
heavy
hoarfrost
so
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
see
from
outside
what
was
going
on
within
or
from
my
seat
behind
the
desk
i
caught
sight
through
the
door
as
it
was
opened
by
a
chance
caller
of
the
gang
on
the
opposite
corner
with
jones
and
his
hickory
club
and
knew
what
was
coming
i
knew
jones
too
and
awaited
his
debut
as
a
fighter
with
some
curiosity
he
came
over
bravely
enough
after
the
fifth
or
sixth
drink
opened
the
door
and
marched
in
with
the
tread
of
a
grenadier
but
the
moment
it
fell
to
behind
him
he
stood
and
shook
so
that
the
club
fairly
rattled
on
the
floor
outside
the
gang
were
hugging
their
sides
in
expectation
of
what
was
coming
well
jones
i
said
what
is
it
he
mumbled
something
so
tremulously
and
incoherently
that
i
felt
really
sorry
for
him
jones
was
not
a
bad
fellow
though
he
was
in
bad
company
just
then
i
told
him
so
and
that
it
would
be
best
for
him
to
go
out
quietly
or
he
might
hurt
himself
he
seemed
to
be
relieved
at
the
suggestion
and
when
i
went
from
behind
the
counter
and
led
him
toward
the
door
he
went
willingly
enough
but
as
i
put
my
hand
on
the
latch
he
remembered
his
errand
and
with
a
sudden
plucking
up
of
courage
at
the
thought
of
the
waiting
gang
he
raised
the
stick
to
strike
at
me
honestly
i
did
touch
the
man
with
a
finger
i
suppose
he
stumbled
over
the
sill
as
i
had
sometimes
done
in
my
sober
senses
whatever
the
cause
he
fell
against
the
window
and
out
with
him
it
went
the
whole
of
the
glass
front
with
a
crash
that
resounded
from
one
end
of
the
avenue
to
the
other
and
brought
neighbors
and
policemen
among
them
my
friend
the
captain
on
a
run
to
the
store
in
the
midst
of
the
wreck
lay
jones
moaning
feebly
that
his
back
was
broken
the
beats
crowded
around
with
loud
outcry
he
threw
him
out
of
the
window
they
cried
we
saw
him
do
it
through
window
and
all
threw
him
bodily
did
he
not
jones
jones
who
was
being
picked
up
and
carried
into
my
office
where
they
laid
him
on
the
counter
while
they
sent
in
haste
for
a
doctor
nodded
that
it
was
so
probably
he
thought
it
was
i
can
not
even
blame
the
beats
it
must
have
seemed
to
them
that
i
threw
him
out
they
called
upon
the
captain
with
vehement
demand
to
arrest
me
for
murder
i
looked
at
him
his
face
was
serious
why
i
did
touch
him
i
said
indignantly
he
must
have
fallen
fallen
they
shouted
we
saw
him
come
flying
through
fallen
look
at
the
window
and
indeed
it
was
a
sorry
sight
howe
came
with
his
instrument
box
and
the
crowd
increased
the
doctor
was
a
young
man
who
had
been
very
much
amused
by
my
battle
with
the
beats
and
though
he
professed
no
special
friendship
for
me
had
no
respect
for
the
others
he
felt
the
groaning
patient
over
punched
him
here
and
there
looked
surprised
and
felt
again
then
he
winked
one
eye
at
the
captain
and
me
jones
he
said
get
up
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
you
go
and
get
sober
the
beats
stood
speechless
he
came
right
through
this
window
they
began
we
saw
him
something
has
come
through
the
window
evidently
said
the
captain
with
asperity
and
broken
it
who
is
to
pay
for
it
if
you
say
it
was
jones
it
is
my
duty
to
hold
you
as
witnesses
if
riis
makes
a
charge
of
disorderly
conduct
against
him
as
i
suppose
he
will
he
trod
hard
on
my
toe
a
man
can
not
jump
through
another
man
window
like
that
here
let
me
but
they
were
gone
i
never
heard
from
them
again
but
ever
after
the
reputation
clung
to
me
of
being
a
terrible
fighter
when
roused
jones
swore
to
it
drunk
or
sober
twenty
witnesses
backed
him
up
i
was
able
to
discharge
pat
that
week
there
was
never
an
ill
word
in
my
street
after
that
i
suppose
my
renown
as
a
scrapper
survives
yet
in
the
old
ward
as
in
the
other
case
the
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
was
perfect
no
link
was
missing
none
could
have
been
forged
to
make
it
stronger
i
would
hang
a
dog
on
such
evidence
and
i
think
i
am
justified
in
taking
that
stand
the
summer
and
fall
had
worn
away
and
no
word
had
come
from
home
mother
who
knew
gave
no
sign
every
day
when
the
came
up
the
street
my
hopes
rose
high
until
he
had
passed
the
letter
i
longed
for
never
came
it
was
farthest
from
my
thoughts
when
one
night
in
the
closing
days
of
a
hot
political
campaign
i
went
to
my
office
and
found
it
lying
there
i
knew
by
the
throbbing
of
my
heart
what
it
was
the
instant
i
saw
it
i
think
i
sat
as
much
as
a
quarter
of
an
hour
staring
dumbly
at
the
unopened
envelope
then
i
arose
slowly
like
one
grown
suddenly
old
put
it
in
my
pocket
and
stumbled
homeward
walking
as
if
in
a
dream
i
went
up
to
my
room
and
locked
myself
in
illustration
the
letter
it
lies
before
me
as
i
write
that
blessed
letter
the
first
i
had
ever
received
much
faded
and
worn
and
patched
in
many
places
to
keep
it
together
the
queer
row
of
foreign
stamps
climbing
over
one
another
she
told
me
afterward
that
she
had
no
idea
how
many
were
needed
for
a
letter
to
america
and
was
afraid
to
ask
so
she
put
on
three
times
more
than
would
have
been
enough
and
the
address
in
her
fair
round
hand
jacob
riis
editor
south
brooklyn
news
fifth
avenue
cor
ninth
street
brooklyn
y
north
america
the
postmark
of
the
little
town
of
hadersleben
where
she
was
teaching
school
the
shape
of
the
envelope
they
all
then
and
there
entered
into
my
life
and
became
part
of
it
to
abide
forever
with
light
and
joy
and
thanksgiving
how
much
of
sunshine
one
little
letter
can
contain
six
years
seemed
all
at
once
the
merest
breath
of
time
to
have
waited
for
it
toil
hardship
trouble
with
that
letter
in
my
keep
i
laughed
out
loud
at
the
thought
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
sobered
me
i
knelt
down
and
prayed
long
and
fervently
that
i
might
strive
with
all
my
might
to
deserve
the
great
happiness
that
had
come
to
me
the
stars
were
long
out
when
my
landlord
who
had
heard
my
restless
walk
overhead
knocked
to
ask
if
anything
was
the
matter
he
must
have
seen
it
in
my
face
when
he
opened
the
door
for
he
took
a
sidelong
step
shading
his
eyes
from
the
lamp
to
get
a
better
look
and
held
out
his
hand
wish
you
joy
old
man
he
said
heartily
tell
us
of
it
will
you
and
i
did
it
is
true
that
all
the
world
loves
a
lover
it
smiled
upon
me
all
day
long
and
i
smiled
back
even
the
beats
looked
askance
at
me
no
longer
the
politicians
who
came
offering
to
buy
the
influence
of
my
paper
in
the
election
were
allowed
to
escape
with
their
lives
i
wrote
i
think
i
wrote
to
her
every
day
at
least
that
is
what
i
do
now
when
i
go
away
from
home
she
laughs
when
she
tells
me
that
in
the
first
letter
i
spoke
of
coming
home
in
a
year
meanwhile
according
to
her
wish
we
were
to
say
nothing
about
it
in
the
second
letter
i
decided
upon
the
following
spring
in
the
third
i
spoke
of
perhaps
going
in
the
winter
the
fourth
and
fifth
preferred
the
early
winter
the
sixth
reached
her
from
hamburg
on
the
heels
of
a
telegram
announcing
that
i
had
that
day
arrived
in
frisia
what
had
happened
was
that
just
at
the
right
moment
the
politicians
had
concluded
upon
the
evidence
of
the
recent
elections
that
they
could
not
allow
an
independent
paper
in
the
ward
and
had
offered
to
buy
it
outright
i
was
dreadfully
overworked
the
doctor
urged
a
change
i
did
not
need
much
urging
so
i
sold
the
paper
for
five
times
what
i
had
paid
for
it
and
took
the
first
steamer
for
home
only
the
other
day
when
i
was
lecturing
in
chicago
a
woman
came
up
and
asked
if
i
was
the
riis
she
had
travelled
with
on
a
hamburg
steamer
years
before
and
who
was
going
home
to
be
married
she
had
never
forgotten
how
happy
he
was
she
and
the
rest
of
the
passengers
held
it
to
be
their
duty
to
warn
me
that
she
might
not
turn
out
as
nice
as
i
thought
she
was
i
guess
we
might
have
spared
ourselves
the
trouble
she
said
looking
me
over
yes
they
might
but
i
shall
have
to
put
off
telling
of
that
till
next
time
and
i
shall
let
elizabeth
my
elizabeth
now
tell
her
part
of
it
in
her
own
way
chapter
vii
elizabeth
tells
her
story
how
well
i
remember
the
days
of
which
my
husband
has
written
our
childhood
in
the
old
danish
town
where
to
this
day
in
spite
of
my
love
for
america
the
air
seems
fresher
the
meadows
greener
the
sea
more
blue
and
where
above
it
all
the
skylark
sings
his
song
clearer
softer
and
sweeter
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
i
it
is
too
bad
that
we
can
not
tell
our
own
stories
without
all
the
time
talking
about
ourselves
but
it
is
so
and
there
is
no
help
for
it
well
then
i
was
a
happy
little
girl
in
those
days
though
my
own
father
a
county
lawyer
had
died
early
and
left
my
dear
mother
without
any
means
of
support
for
herself
and
three
children
except
what
she
earned
by
teaching
school
and
music
it
did
not
make
life
harder
for
me
for
i
had
been
since
i
was
three
years
old
with
mother
youngest
and
loveliest
sister
and
her
husband
they
were
rich
and
prosperous
they
brought
me
up
as
their
own
and
never
had
a
child
a
kinder
father
and
mother
or
a
more
beautiful
home
than
i
had
with
my
uncle
and
aunt
besides
i
was
naturally
a
happy
child
life
seemed
full
of
sunshine
and
every
day
dawned
with
promise
of
joy
and
pleasure
i
remember
often
saying
to
my
aunt
whom
by
the
way
i
called
mother
i
am
so
happy
i
know
what
to
do
illustration
elizabeth
mother
so
i
skipped
and
danced
about
among
the
lumber
in
the
sight
of
jacob
riis
till
in
sheer
amazement
he
cut
his
finger
off
says
admiration
not
amazement
but
i
have
my
own
ideas
about
that
i
see
him
yet
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
and
a
defiant
look
making
his
way
across
the
hall
at
to
engage
me
as
his
partner
i
did
not
appreciate
the
compliment
in
the
least
for
i
would
a
good
deal
rather
have
had
charles
who
danced
well
and
was
a
much
nicer
looking
boy
besides
charles
sister
valgerda
had
told
me
in
confidence
how
jacob
had
said
to
charles
that
he
would
marry
me
when
i
was
a
woman
or
die
and
was
there
ever
such
assurance
from
the
day
i
learned
of
this
i
treated
jacob
with
all
the
coolness
and
contempt
of
which
my
naturally
kindly
disposition
was
capable
when
he
spoke
to
me
i
answered
him
hardly
a
word
and
took
pains
to
show
my
preference
for
charles
or
some
other
boy
but
it
seemed
to
make
no
difference
to
him
i
was
just
seventeen
when
i
received
my
first
from
jacob
like
the
dutiful
fellow
he
was
he
sent
it
through
his
mother
to
my
mother
who
read
it
before
giving
it
to
me
she
handed
it
to
me
with
the
words
i
need
not
tell
you
that
neither
father
nor
i
would
ever
give
our
consent
to
an
engagement
between
you
two
till
jacob
had
some
good
position
way
down
in
my
heart
there
was
a
small
voice
whispering
well
if
i
loved
him
i
would
ask
anybody
but
the
letter
was
a
beautiful
one
and
after
these
many
years
i
know
that
every
word
in
it
was
prompted
by
true
unselfish
love
i
cried
over
it
and
answered
it
as
best
i
could
and
then
after
a
while
forgot
about
it
and
was
happy
as
ever
with
my
studies
my
music
and
plenty
of
dances
and
parties
to
break
the
routine
jacob
had
gone
away
to
america
before
i
was
twenty
years
old
i
met
one
who
was
to
have
a
great
influence
on
my
life
he
was
a
dashing
cavalry
officer
much
older
than
i
and
a
frequent
visitor
at
our
home
and
here
i
must
tell
that
my
own
dear
mother
had
died
when
i
was
fifteen
years
old
and
my
brother
and
sister
had
come
to
live
with
us
in
ribe
there
was
and
for
us
all
there
they
were
very
good
to
us
my
uncle
and
aunt
and
i
loved
them
as
if
they
were
indeed
my
parents
they
spared
no
expense
in
our
bringing
up
nothing
they
gave
their
only
son
was
too
good
for
us
our
home
was
a
very
beautiful
and
happy
one
illustration
elizabeth
home
the
castle
it
was
in
the
summer
of
that
i
met
raymond
that
is
not
a
danish
name
but
it
was
his
he
came
to
our
little
town
as
next
in
command
of
a
company
of
gendarmes
mounted
frontier
police
in
the
army
he
had
served
with
my
mother
brother
and
naturally
father
and
mother
whose
hospitable
home
welcomed
every
distinguished
stranger
did
everything
to
make
his
existence
in
what
must
to
a
man
of
the
world
have
been
a
dull
little
town
less
lonely
than
it
would
otherwise
have
been
he
had
a
good
record
had
been
brave
in
the
war
was
the
finest
horseman
in
all
the
country
could
skate
and
dance
and
talk
and
best
of
all
was
known
to
be
a
good
and
loving
son
to
his
widowed
mother
and
greatly
beloved
by
his
comrades
so
he
came
into
my
life
and
singled
me
out
before
the
other
girls
at
the
balls
and
parties
where
we
frequently
met
strange
as
it
may
seem
for
i
was
not
a
pretty
girl
i
had
many
admirers
among
the
young
men
in
our
town
perhaps
there
was
really
any
admiration
about
it
perhaps
it
was
just
because
we
knew
each
other
as
boys
and
girls
and
were
brought
up
together
most
of
the
young
men
in
our
town
were
college
students
who
had
gone
to
school
in
ribe
and
came
back
at
vacation
time
to
renew
old
friendships
and
have
a
good
time
with
old
neighbors
i
danced
well
played
the
piano
well
and
was
full
of
life
and
they
all
liked
to
come
in
our
house
where
there
were
plenty
of
good
things
of
all
kinds
so
i
really
ought
not
to
say
that
i
who
frequently
cried
over
the
length
of
my
nose
had
admirers
i
should
rather
say
good
friends
who
saw
to
it
in
their
kindness
that
i
never
was
a
at
a
ball
or
lacked
favors
at
a
cotillon
but
he
was
so
different
the
others
were
young
like
myself
he
had
experience
he
was
a
man
handsome
and
good
just
such
a
man
as
would
be
likely
to
take
the
fancy
of
a
girl
of
my
age
and
he
who
had
seen
so
many
girls
prettier
and
better
than
i
singled
me
out
of
them
all
and
i
well
i
was
proud
of
the
distinction
and
i
loved
him
how
well
i
remember
the
clear
winter
day
when
he
and
i
skated
and
talked
and
talked
and
skated
till
the
moon
was
high
in
the
heavens
and
my
brother
was
sent
out
to
look
for
me
i
went
home
that
evening
the
happiest
girl
in
the
world
so
i
thought
for
he
had
called
me
a
beautiful
child
and
told
me
that
he
loved
me
and
father
and
mother
had
given
their
consent
to
our
engagement
never
did
the
sun
shine
so
brightly
never
did
the
bells
ring
out
so
clearly
and
appealingly
in
the
old
cathedral
and
surely
never
was
the
world
so
beautiful
as
on
the
sunday
morning
after
our
engagement
when
i
awoke
early
in
my
dear
little
room
oh
how
i
loved
the
whole
world
and
every
one
in
it
how
good
god
was
how
kind
and
loving
my
father
and
mother
and
brother
and
sisters
how
i
would
love
to
be
good
to
every
one
around
me
and
thus
in
a
measure
show
my
gratitude
for
all
the
happiness
that
was
mine
so
passed
the
winter
and
spring
with
many
preparations
for
our
new
home
and
much
planning
for
our
future
life
in
a
town
like
ours
where
everybody
knew
all
about
everybody
else
from
the
day
they
were
born
till
the
day
they
died
it
was
only
reasonable
to
suppose
that
somebody
had
told
my
betrothed
about
jacob
riis
love
for
me
i
had
hoped
that
jacob
would
learn
to
look
at
me
in
a
different
light
but
from
little
messages
which
came
to
me
off
and
on
from
the
new
world
i
knew
that
he
was
just
as
faithful
as
ever
to
his
idea
that
we
were
meant
for
one
another
and
that
i
might
say
him
no
time
and
time
again
the
day
would
come
when
i
would
change
my
mind
but
in
the
first
happy
days
of
our
engagement
i
confess
that
i
did
not
think
very
much
about
him
except
for
mentioning
him
once
or
twice
to
my
friend
as
a
good
fellow
but
such
a
queer
and
obstinate
one
who
some
day
would
see
plainly
that
i
was
not
half
as
good
as
he
thought
and
learn
to
love
some
other
girl
who
was
much
better
but
one
day
there
came
a
letter
from
america
and
so
far
was
jacob
from
my
thoughts
at
that
moment
that
when
my
lieutenant
asked
me
from
whom
did
i
think
that
american
letter
came
i
answered
in
perfect
good
faith
that
i
could
not
imagine
unless
it
were
from
a
former
servant
of
ours
who
lived
over
there
no
servant
ever
wrote
that
address
said
raymond
dryly
it
was
from
jacob
and
filled
with
good
wishes
for
us
both
he
listened
to
it
in
silence
i
said
how
glad
i
was
to
find
that
at
last
he
looked
upon
me
merely
as
a
friend
you
little
know
how
to
read
between
the
lines
was
his
sober
comment
he
was
very
serious
almost
sad
it
seemed
to
me
in
the
early
summer
came
the
first
cloud
on
my
sunlit
sky
one
evening
when
we
were
invited
to
a
party
of
young
people
at
our
doctor
house
word
was
sent
from
raymond
that
he
was
sick
and
could
not
come
but
that
i
must
on
no
account
stay
home
but
i
did
for
me
there
was
no
pleasure
without
him
no
not
anywhere
in
the
world
he
recovered
soon
however
but
after
that
short
spells
of
illness
mostly
heavy
colds
were
the
rule
he
was
a
strong
man
and
had
taken
pride
in
being
able
to
do
things
which
few
other
men
could
do
without
harm
coming
to
them
for
instance
to
chop
a
hole
in
the
ice
and
go
swimming
in
midwinter
but
exposure
to
the
chill
damp
air
of
that
north
sea
country
and
the
heavy
fogs
that
drifted
in
from
the
ocean
at
night
when
he
rode
alone
often
many
miles
over
the
moor
on
his
tours
of
inspection
had
undermined
his
splendid
constitution
and
before
the
summer
was
over
the
doctors
pronounced
my
dear
one
a
sufferer
from
bronchial
consumption
and
told
us
that
his
only
chance
lay
in
his
seeking
a
milder
climate
i
grieved
at
the
thought
of
separation
for
a
whole
winter
perhaps
longer
and
at
his
suffering
but
i
felt
sure
that
he
would
come
back
to
me
from
switzerland
a
well
man
so
we
parted
that
winter
we
lived
in
our
letters
the
fine
climate
in
montreux
seemed
to
do
him
good
and
his
messages
were
full
of
hope
that
all
would
be
well
not
so
with
my
parents
they
had
been
told
by
physicians
who
had
treated
raymond
that
his
case
was
hopeless
that
he
might
live
years
perhaps
in
switzerland
but
that
in
all
probability
to
return
to
denmark
would
be
fatal
to
him
they
told
me
so
and
i
could
not
would
not
believe
them
it
seemed
impossible
that
god
would
take
him
away
from
me
they
also
told
me
that
on
no
condition
must
i
think
of
marrying
him
because
either
i
should
be
a
widow
soon
after
marriage
or
else
i
should
be
a
for
several
years
so
they
wished
me
to
break
the
engagement
while
he
was
absent
this
and
much
more
was
said
to
me
and
i
who
had
always
been
an
obedient
daughter
and
never
crossed
their
will
in
any
way
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
opposed
them
and
told
them
that
never
should
anybody
separate
me
from
the
one
i
loved
until
god
himself
parted
us
mother
reminded
me
of
my
happy
childhood
and
of
how
much
she
and
my
had
done
for
me
and
that
now
they
had
only
my
happiness
in
view
a
fact
which
i
might
not
understand
till
i
was
older
she
said
but
must
now
take
on
trust
beside
which
raymond
would
be
made
to
feel
as
if
a
load
were
taken
off
his
mind
if
of
my
free
will
i
broke
our
engagement
and
left
him
free
from
any
responsibility
toward
me
but
all
the
time
his
letters
told
me
that
he
loved
me
better
than
ever
and
i
lived
only
in
the
hope
of
his
so
i
refused
to
listen
to
them
they
wrote
to
him
told
him
what
the
doctor
said
and
appealed
to
him
to
set
me
free
and
he
loyal
and
good
as
he
was
gave
me
back
my
promise
he
believed
he
would
get
well
but
he
knew
he
could
not
return
to
ribe
he
had
resigned
his
command
and
gone
back
to
the
rank
and
pay
of
a
plain
lieutenant
he
could
not
offer
me
now
such
a
home
as
i
was
used
to
these
many
years
and
as
he
was
so
much
older
than
i
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
tell
me
all
this
and
all
the
time
he
knew
oh
so
well
that
i
would
never
leave
him
come
what
might
sickness
poverty
or
death
itself
i
was
bound
to
stand
by
him
to
the
last
that
was
a
hard
winter
father
and
mother
who
could
not
look
into
my
heart
and
see
that
i
still
loved
them
as
dearly
as
ever
i
know
so
well
they
meant
it
all
for
the
best
called
me
ungrateful
and
told
me
that
i
was
blind
and
would
not
see
what
made
for
my
good
and
that
therefore
they
must
take
their
own
measures
for
my
happiness
so
they
offered
me
the
choice
between
giving
up
the
one
i
loved
or
leaving
the
home
that
had
been
mine
so
long
i
chose
the
last
for
i
could
not
do
otherwise
i
packed
my
clothes
and
said
to
my
friends
of
whom
many
treated
me
with
coldness
since
they
too
thought
i
must
be
ungrateful
to
those
who
had
done
so
much
for
me
homeless
and
alone
i
went
to
raymond
brother
who
had
a
little
country
home
near
the
city
of
copenhagen
with
him
and
his
young
wife
i
stayed
until
one
day
my
raymond
returned
much
better
apparently
yet
not
the
same
as
before
suffering
bodily
and
mental
had
left
its
traces
upon
his
face
and
frame
but
his
love
for
me
was
greater
than
ever
and
he
tried
hard
to
make
up
to
me
all
i
lost
as
if
i
had
really
lost
anything
in
choosing
him
before
all
the
world
we
were
very
happy
at
first
in
the
joy
of
being
together
but
soon
he
suffered
a
relapse
and
decided
to
go
to
the
hospital
for
treatment
he
never
left
it
again
except
once
or
twice
for
a
walk
with
me
all
the
long
beautiful
summer
days
he
spent
in
his
room
the
last
few
months
in
bed
many
friends
came
to
see
him
and
as
for
me
i
spent
all
my
days
with
him
reading
softly
to
him
or
talking
with
him
and
i
never
gave
up
hope
of
his
getting
better
some
day
he
probably
knew
that
his
time
was
short
but
i
think
that
he
did
not
have
the
heart
to
tell
me
sometimes
he
would
say
i
wonder
whether
your
people
would
take
you
back
to
your
home
if
i
died
or
if
i
should
die
and
some
other
man
who
loved
you
and
who
you
knew
was
good
and
faithful
should
ask
you
to
marry
him
you
ought
to
accept
him
even
if
you
did
not
love
him
i
never
could
bear
to
hear
it
or
to
think
of
it
then
one
raw
dark
november
morning
i
started
on
the
long
walk
from
his
mother
house
where
i
had
stayed
since
he
took
to
his
bed
to
go
and
spend
the
day
with
him
as
usual
by
this
time
i
was
well
acquainted
with
every
one
in
the
hospital
the
nurses
were
good
to
me
they
took
off
my
shoes
and
dried
and
warmed
them
for
me
and
some
brought
me
afternoon
coffee
which
otherwise
was
contraband
in
the
but
this
morning
the
nurse
in
charge
of
ward
turned
her
back
upon
me
and
pretended
not
to
hear
me
when
i
bid
her
when
i
entered
his
room
it
was
to
find
the
lifeless
body
of
him
who
only
a
few
hours
before
had
bidden
me
a
loving
and
even
cheerful
oh
the
utter
loneliness
of
those
days
the
longing
for
mother
and
home
but
no
word
came
from
ribe
then
my
dear
one
was
laid
to
rest
with
the
sweet
resigned
smile
on
his
brave
face
and
i
stayed
for
a
while
with
his
people
not
being
quite
able
to
look
into
the
future
my
father
had
meanwhile
made
provision
for
me
at
copenhagen
when
i
was
able
to
think
clearly
i
went
to
the
school
in
which
my
education
had
been
finished
in
the
happy
careless
days
and
through
its
managers
secured
a
position
in
baron
von
d
house
not
far
from
my
old
home
but
in
the
province
that
was
taken
from
denmark
by
germany
the
winter
i
played
in
the
my
employers
were
kind
to
me
and
my
three
girl
pupils
soon
were
the
firm
friends
of
the
quiet
little
governess
with
the
sad
face
we
worked
hard
together
to
forget
if
i
could
but
each
day
i
turned
my
face
to
the
west
toward
ribe
and
my
heart
cried
out
for
my
happy
childhood
illustration
elizabeth
as
i
found
her
again
at
last
mother
sent
for
me
to
come
to
them
in
the
summer
vacation
oh
how
good
it
was
to
go
home
again
how
nice
they
all
were
and
what
quiet
content
i
felt
though
i
knew
i
should
never
forget
the
six
weeks
went
by
like
a
dream
on
the
last
day
as
i
was
leaving
mother
gave
me
a
letter
from
jacob
riis
of
whom
i
had
not
thought
for
a
long
while
it
was
a
letter
of
proposal
and
i
was
angry
i
answered
it
however
as
nicely
as
i
could
and
sent
the
letter
to
his
mother
then
i
returned
to
my
three
pupils
in
their
pleasant
country
home
and
soon
we
were
busy
with
our
studies
and
our
walks
but
i
felt
lonelier
than
ever
longed
more
than
ever
for
the
days
that
had
been
and
would
never
return
i
could
not
sleep
and
grew
pale
and
thin
and
ever
raymond
words
about
a
friend
good
and
faithful
who
loved
me
truly
came
back
to
me
did
he
mean
jacob
who
had
surely
proved
constant
and
like
me
had
suffered
much
he
was
lonely
and
i
was
lonely
oh
so
lonely
what
if
i
were
to
accept
his
offer
and
when
he
came
home
go
back
with
him
to
his
strange
new
country
to
share
his
busy
life
and
in
trying
to
make
him
happy
perhaps
find
happiness
myself
unless
i
asked
him
to
come
he
would
probably
never
return
the
thought
of
how
glad
it
would
make
his
parents
if
they
could
see
him
again
now
that
they
had
buried
two
fine
sons
almost
tempted
me
yet
again
it
was
too
soon
too
soon
i
banished
the
thought
with
angry
impatience
but
in
the
still
night
watches
it
came
and
knocked
again
jacob
need
not
come
home
just
now
we
might
write
and
get
acquainted
and
get
used
to
the
idea
of
each
other
and
his
old
people
could
look
forward
to
the
joy
of
having
him
return
in
a
year
or
two
at
last
one
night
i
got
up
at
two
sat
down
at
my
desk
and
wrote
to
him
in
perfect
sincerity
all
that
was
in
my
mind
concerning
him
and
that
if
he
still
would
have
me
i
was
willing
to
go
with
him
to
america
if
he
would
come
for
me
some
time
strange
to
say
jacob
mother
had
never
sent
the
letter
in
which
i
refused
him
a
second
time
perhaps
she
thought
his
constancy
and
great
love
would
at
last
touch
my
heart
longing
as
it
was
for
somebody
to
cling
to
so
that
he
got
my
last
letter
first
but
instead
of
waiting
several
years
he
came
in
a
few
weeks
he
was
always
that
way
and
now
after
happy
years
elisabeth
footnote
that
is
right
up
to
this
the
printer
has
had
his
way
now
we
will
have
ours
she
and
i
and
spell
her
name
properly
together
we
shall
manage
him
i
cut
the
rest
of
it
off
because
i
am
the
editor
and
want
to
begin
again
here
myself
and
what
is
the
use
of
being
an
editor
unless
you
can
cut
copy
also
it
is
not
good
for
woman
to
allow
her
to
say
too
much
she
has
already
said
too
much
about
that
letter
i
have
got
it
in
my
pocket
and
i
guess
i
ought
to
know
your
own
elisabeth
was
not
that
enough
for
him
with
his
poor
saddened
life
peace
be
to
its
memory
he
loved
her
that
covers
all
how
could
he
help
it
if
they
did
not
think
i
had
lost
my
senses
before
they
assuredly
did
when
that
telegram
reached
ribe
talk
about
the
privacy
of
the
mails
the
telegraph
is
part
of
the
machinery
there
official
propriety
and
all
that
why
i
do
suppose
that
telegraph
operator
could
get
his
coat
on
quick
enough
to
go
out
and
tell
the
amazing
news
it
would
not
have
been
human
nature
certainly
not
ribe
human
nature
before
sundown
it
was
all
over
town
that
jacob
riis
was
coming
home
and
coming
for
elisabeth
poor
girl
it
was
in
the
christmas
holidays
and
she
was
visiting
there
she
had
been
debating
in
her
own
mind
whether
to
tell
her
mother
and
how
but
they
left
her
precious
little
time
for
debate
in
a
neighborhood
gathering
that
night
one
stern
uncompromising
dowager
transfixed
her
with
avenging
eye
they
say
jacob
riis
is
coming
home
she
observed
elisabeth
knitted
away
furiously
her
cheeks
turning
pink
for
all
she
made
believe
she
did
not
hear
they
say
he
is
coming
back
to
propose
to
a
certain
young
lady
again
continued
the
dowager
pitilessly
her
voice
rising
there
was
the
stillness
of
death
in
the
room
elisabeth
dropped
a
stitch
tried
to
pick
it
up
failed
and
fled
her
mother
from
her
seat
observed
with
dignity
that
it
blew
like
to
bring
on
a
flood
you
could
almost
hear
the
big
cathedral
bell
singing
in
the
tower
and
the
subject
was
changed
but
i
will
warrant
that
ribe
got
no
wink
of
sleep
that
night
the
while
i
fumed
in
a
wayside
holstein
inn
in
my
wild
rush
to
get
home
i
had
taken
the
wrong
train
from
hamburg
or
forgot
to
change
or
something
i
do
to
this
day
know
what
i
know
that
night
coming
on
found
me
stranded
in
a
little
town
i
had
never
heard
of
on
a
spur
of
the
road
i
did
know
existed
and
there
i
had
to
stay
raging
at
the
railroad
at
the
inn
at
everything
in
the
middle
of
the
night
while
i
was
tossing
sleepless
on
the
big
bed
a
drunken
man
who
had
gone
wrong
fell
into
my
room
with
the
door
and
a
candle
that
man
was
my
friend
i
got
up
and
kicked
him
out
called
the
landlord
and
blew
him
up
and
felt
much
better
the
sun
had
not
risen
when
i
was
posting
back
to
the
junction
counting
the
as
we
sped
watch
in
hand
if
mother
thought
we
had
all
gone
mad
together
there
was
certainly
something
to
excuse
her
here
she
had
only
a
few
weeks
before
forwarded
with
a
heavy
heart
to
her
son
in
america
elisabeth
flat
refusal
to
hear
him
and
when
she
expected
gloom
and
despair
all
at
once
his
letters
overflowed
with
a
hysterical
happiness
that
could
only
hail
from
a
disordered
mind
to
cap
it
all
christmas
eve
brought
her
the
shock
of
her
life
elisabeth
sitting
near
her
in
the
old
church
and
remorsefully
watching
her
weep
for
her
buried
boys
could
not
resist
the
impulse
to
steal
up
behind
as
they
were
going
out
and
whisper
into
her
ear
as
she
gave
her
a
little
vicarious
hug
i
have
had
news
from
jacob
he
is
happy
the
look
of
measureless
astonishment
on
my
mother
face
as
she
turned
recalled
to
her
that
she
could
not
know
and
she
hurried
away
while
mother
stood
and
looked
after
her
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
i
verily
believe
thinking
hard
things
of
a
and
of
her
oh
mother
could
you
but
have
known
that
that
hug
was
for
your
boy
counting
hours
no
longer
but
minutes
till
i
should
claim
it
myself
i
sat
straining
my
eyes
in
the
dark
for
the
first
glimmer
of
lights
in
the
old
town
when
my
train
pulled
up
at
a
station
a
dozen
miles
from
home
the
guard
ran
along
and
threw
open
the
doors
of
the
compartments
i
heard
voices
and
the
cry
this
way
herr
doctor
there
is
room
in
here
and
upon
the
step
loomed
the
tall
form
of
our
old
family
physician
as
i
started
up
with
a
cry
of
recognition
he
settled
into
a
seat
with
a
contented
here
overlaerer
is
one
for
you
and
i
was
face
to
face
with
my
father
grown
very
old
and
white
my
heart
smote
me
at
the
sight
of
his
venerable
head
illustration
i
was
face
to
face
with
my
father
father
i
cried
and
reached
out
for
him
i
think
he
thought
he
saw
a
ghost
he
stood
quite
still
steadying
himself
against
the
door
and
his
face
grew
very
pale
it
was
the
doctor
ever
the
most
jovial
of
men
who
first
recovered
himself
bless
my
soul
he
cried
bless
my
soul
if
here
is
not
jacob
come
back
from
the
wilds
as
large
as
life
welcome
home
boy
and
we
laughed
and
shook
hands
they
had
been
out
to
see
a
friend
in
the
country
and
had
happened
upon
my
train
at
the
door
of
our
house
father
who
had
picked
up
two
of
my
brothers
at
the
depot
halted
and
thought
better
let
me
go
in
first
he
said
and
being
a
small
man
put
the
door
of
the
between
me
and
mother
so
that
she
could
not
see
me
right
away
what
do
you
think
he
began
but
his
voice
shook
so
that
mother
rose
to
her
feet
at
once
how
do
mothers
know
jacob
she
cried
and
pushing
past
him
had
me
in
her
embrace
that
was
a
happy
if
mother
tears
fell
as
she
told
of
my
brothers
the
sting
was
taken
out
of
her
grief
perhaps
it
was
never
there
to
her
there
is
no
death
of
her
dear
ones
but
rejoicing
in
the
midst
of
human
sorrow
that
they
have
gone
home
where
she
shall
find
them
again
if
ever
a
doubt
had
arisen
in
my
mind
of
that
home
how
could
it
linger
how
could
i
betray
my
mother
faith
or
question
it
perfectly
happy
were
we
but
when
the
were
removed
and
i
began
to
look
restlessly
at
my
watch
and
talk
of
an
errand
i
must
go
a
shadow
of
anxiety
came
into
my
father
eyes
mother
looked
at
me
with
mute
appeal
they
were
still
as
far
from
the
truth
as
ever
a
wild
notion
that
i
had
come
for
some
other
man
daughter
had
entered
their
minds
or
else
god
help
me
that
i
had
lost
mine
i
kissed
mother
and
quieted
her
fears
i
will
tell
you
when
i
come
back
and
when
she
would
have
sent
my
brothers
with
me
no
this
walk
i
must
take
alone
thank
god
for
it
so
i
went
over
the
river
over
the
long
bridge
where
i
first
met
her
and
from
the
arch
of
which
i
hailed
the
light
in
her
window
the
beacon
that
had
beckoned
me
all
the
years
while
two
oceans
surged
between
us
under
the
hedge
where
i
had
dreamed
of
her
as
a
boy
and
presently
i
stood
upon
the
broad
stone
steps
of
her
father
house
and
rang
the
bell
an
old
servant
opened
the
door
and
with
a
grave
nod
of
recognition
showed
me
into
the
room
to
the
left
the
very
one
where
i
had
taken
leave
of
her
six
years
before
then
went
unasked
to
call
miss
elisabeth
it
was
new
year
eve
and
they
were
having
a
card
party
in
the
parlor
oh
it
is
said
she
with
her
heart
in
her
mouth
pausing
on
the
threshold
and
looking
appealingly
at
the
maid
it
was
the
same
who
years
before
had
told
her
how
i
kept
vigil
under
her
window
yes
it
is
she
said
mercilessly
it
him
and
she
pushed
her
in
illustration
bringing
the
loved
up
flowers
i
think
it
was
i
who
spoke
first
do
you
remember
when
the
ice
broke
on
the
big
ditch
and
i
had
you
in
my
arms
so
lifting
you
over
was
i
heavy
she
asked
irrelevantly
and
we
both
laughed
father
shone
upon
the
open
bible
when
i
returned
he
wiped
his
spectacles
and
looked
up
with
a
patiently
questioning
well
my
boy
mother
laid
her
hand
upon
mine
i
came
home
i
said
unsteadily
to
give
you
elisabeth
for
a
daughter
she
has
promised
to
be
my
wife
mother
clung
to
me
and
wept
father
turned
the
leaves
of
the
book
with
hands
that
trembled
in
spite
of
himself
and
read
not
unto
us
o
lord
not
unto
us
but
unto
thy
name
give
glory
for
thy
mercy
his
voice
faltered
and
broke
the
old
town
turned
out
to
the
last
man
and
woman
and
crowded
the
domkirke
on
that
march
day
years
ago
when
i
bore
her
home
my
bride
from
earliest
morning
the
street
that
led
to
the
castle
had
seen
a
strange
procession
of
poor
and
aged
women
pass
carrying
flowers
grown
in
in
the
scant
sunlight
of
the
long
northern
winter
loved
up
they
say
in
danish
for
grown
in
no
other
way
could
it
be
done
they
were
pensioners
on
her
mother
bounty
bringing
their
gifts
to
the
friend
who
was
going
away
and
it
was
their
flowers
she
wore
when
i
led
her
down
the
church
aisle
my
wife
my
own
the
castle
opened
its
doors
hospitably
at
last
to
the
lad
when
they
fell
to
behind
us
with
father
mother
and
friends
waving
tearful
from
the
steps
and
the
wheels
of
the
rattled
over
the
cobblestones
of
the
silent
streets
where
old
neighbors
had
set
lights
in
their
windows
to
cheer
us
on
the
way
out
into
the
open
country
into
the
wide
world
our
journey
had
begun
looking
steadfastly
ahead
over
the
bleak
moor
into
the
unknown
beyond
i
knew
in
my
soul
that
i
should
conquer
for
her
head
was
leaning
trustfully
on
my
shoulder
and
her
hand
was
in
mine
and
all
was
well
illustration
out
into
the
open
country
into
the
wide
world
our
life
journey
had
begun
chapter
viii
early
married
life
i
become
an
advertising
bureau
on
the
tribune
it
was
no
easy
life
to
which
i
brought
home
my
young
wife
i
felt
it
often
with
a
secret
pang
when
i
thought
how
few
friends
i
had
to
offer
her
for
those
she
had
left
and
how
very
different
was
the
whole
setting
of
her
new
home
at
such
times
i
set
my
teeth
hard
and
promised
myself
that
some
day
she
should
have
the
best
in
the
land
she
never
with
word
or
look
betrayed
if
she
too
felt
the
pang
we
were
comrades
for
better
or
worse
from
the
day
she
put
her
hand
in
mine
and
never
was
there
a
more
loyal
and
faithful
one
if
when
in
the
twilight
she
played
softly
to
herself
the
old
airs
from
home
the
tune
was
smothered
in
a
sob
that
was
not
for
my
ear
and
shortly
our
kitchen
resounded
with
the
most
tremendously
energetic
housekeeping
on
record
i
did
not
hear
i
had
drunk
that
cup
to
the
dregs
and
i
knew
i
just
put
on
a
gingham
apron
and
turned
in
to
help
her
two
can
battle
with
a
fit
of
homesickness
much
better
than
one
even
if
never
a
word
is
said
about
it
and
it
can
very
rarely
resist
a
man
with
an
apron
on
i
suppose
he
looks
too
ridiculous
besides
housekeeping
in
double
harness
was
a
vastly
different
matter
from
going
it
single
not
that
it
was
plain
sailing
by
any
manner
of
means
neither
of
us
knew
anything
about
it
but
we
were
there
to
find
out
and
exploring
together
was
fine
fun
we
started
fair
by
laying
in
a
stock
of
everything
there
was
in
the
and
in
the
grocery
from
mace
which
neither
of
us
knew
what
was
to
the
prunes
which
we
never
got
a
chance
to
cook
because
we
ate
them
all
up
together
before
we
could
find
a
place
where
they
fitted
in
the
deep
councils
we
held
over
the
disposal
of
those
things
and
the
strange
results
which
followed
sometimes
certain
rocks
we
were
able
to
steer
clear
of
because
i
had
carefully
charted
them
in
the
days
of
my
bachelorhood
in
the
matter
of
sago
for
instance
which
swells
so
when
cooked
you
would
never
believe
it
but
there
were
plenty
of
unknown
reefs
i
mind
our
first
chicken
i
can
not
to
this
day
imagine
what
was
the
matter
with
that
strange
bird
i
was
compelled
to
be
at
the
office
that
afternoon
but
i
sent
my
grinning
devil
up
to
the
house
every
for
bulletins
as
to
how
it
was
getting
on
when
i
came
home
in
the
gloaming
it
was
sizzling
yet
and
my
wife
was
regarding
it
with
a
strained
look
and
with
cheeks
which
the
fire
had
dyed
a
most
lovely
red
i
can
see
her
now
she
was
just
too
charming
for
anything
with
the
chicken
something
was
wrong
as
i
said
i
do
know
what
it
was
and
i
do
care
the
skin
was
all
drawn
tight
over
the
bones
like
the
covering
on
an
umbrella
frame
and
there
was
no
end
of
fat
in
the
pan
that
we
did
know
what
to
do
with
but
our
supper
of
bread
and
cheese
that
night
was
a
meal
fit
for
a
king
my
mother
who
was
a
notable
cook
never
made
one
so
fine
it
is
all
stuff
about
mothers
doing
those
things
better
who
cares
anyhow
have
mothers
curls
of
gold
and
long
eyelashes
and
have
they
arch
ways
and
do
they
pout
and
have
pet
names
well
then
are
not
these
of
the
very
essence
of
cookery
all
the
dry
books
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
some
day
some
one
will
publish
a
real
for
young
housekeepers
but
it
will
be
a
wise
husband
with
the
proper
sense
of
things
not
a
motherly
person
at
all
who
will
write
it
they
make
things
that
are
good
enough
to
eat
but
that
is
not
the
best
part
of
cooking
by
long
odds
there
is
one
housekeeping
feat
of
which
elisabeth
says
she
is
ashamed
yet
i
am
not
i
bet
it
was
fine
it
was
that
cake
we
took
so
much
trouble
with
the
yeast
went
in
all
right
but
something
else
went
wrong
it
was
not
put
to
soak
or
to
sizzle
in
the
oven
or
whatever
it
was
like
my
pancake
it
did
not
rise
and
in
the
darkness
before
i
came
home
she
smuggled
it
out
of
the
house
only
to
behold
with
a
mortification
that
endures
to
this
day
the
who
had
taken
such
an
interest
in
our
young
housekeeping
examining
it
carefully
in
the
next
morning
people
curious
but
they
were
welcome
to
all
they
could
spy
out
concerning
our
household
they
discovered
there
if
they
looked
right
the
sweetest
and
altogether
the
bravest
little
housekeeper
in
all
the
world
and
what
does
a
cake
matter
or
a
hen
or
twenty
when
only
the
housekeeper
is
right
in
my
editorial
enthusiasm
for
the
new
plan
there
was
no
doubtful
note
the
beats
got
a
rest
for
a
season
while
i
transferred
my
attention
to
the
my
wife
teases
me
yet
with
those
mighty
onslaughts
on
the
new
enemy
having
clearly
made
him
out
by
the
light
of
our
evening
lamp
i
went
for
him
with
might
and
main
determined
to
leave
no
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
or
at
least
of
south
brooklyn
ours
i
cried
weekly
to
fulfil
its
destiny
must
be
a
nation
of
homes
down
with
the
and
the
politicians
applauded
they
were
glad
to
be
let
alone
so
were
the
beats
who
were
behind
in
their
bills
and
whose
champion
i
had
unexpectedly
become
a
doughty
champion
too
a
walking
advertisement
of
my
own
prescription
for
i
grew
fat
and
strong
whereas
i
had
been
lean
and
poor
i
was
happy
that
was
it
very
very
happy
and
full
of
faith
in
our
ability
to
fight
our
way
through
come
what
might
nor
did
it
require
the
gift
of
a
prophet
to
make
out
that
trying
days
were
coming
for
my
position
again
as
the
paid
editor
of
my
once
owners
the
politicians
was
rapidly
becoming
untenable
it
was
an
agreement
entered
into
temporarily
when
it
should
lapse
what
then
i
had
pledged
myself
when
i
sold
the
paper
not
to
start
another
for
ten
years
in
south
brooklyn
so
i
would
have
to
begin
life
over
again
in
a
new
place
i
gave
the
matter
but
little
thought
i
suppose
the
old
folks
viewing
it
all
from
over
there
thought
it
trifling
with
fate
it
was
not
it
was
a
trumpet
challenge
to
it
to
come
on
all
that
could
crowd
in
two
we
would
beat
the
world
before
i
record
the
onset
that
ensued
i
must
stop
to
tell
of
another
fight
one
which
in
my
soul
i
regret
though
it
makes
me
laugh
even
now
never
appealed
to
me
except
in
the
evildoer
who
has
been
knocked
down
for
cause
i
suppose
it
is
wicked
but
i
promised
to
tell
the
truth
and
i
always
did
like
peter
for
knocking
off
the
ear
of
the
high
priest
servant
if
only
it
had
been
the
high
priest
own
ear
and
so
when
the
rev
no
i
will
not
mention
names
he
was
brother
simmons
successor
that
is
what
grieves
me
when
he
found
fault
with
the
for
being
on
sale
sundays
if
i
remember
rightly
and
preached
about
it
announcing
that
never
in
the
most
anxious
days
of
the
war
had
he
looked
in
a
newspaper
on
the
sabbath
and
when
ill
luck
would
have
it
that
on
the
same
sunday
i
beheld
his
reverence
who
was
a
choleric
man
hotly
stoning
a
neighbor
hen
from
his
garden
i
drew
editorial
parallels
which
were
not
soothing
to
the
reverend
temper
what
really
ailed
was
that
he
was
lacking
in
common
sense
or
he
would
never
have
called
upon
me
with
his
whole
board
of
deacons
in
the
quiet
of
the
sunday
noon
right
after
church
to
demand
a
retraction
i
have
no
hope
that
a
sense
of
the
humor
of
the
thing
found
its
way
into
the
clerical
consciousness
when
i
replied
that
i
never
in
the
most
exciting
times
transacted
business
on
sunday
for
if
it
had
we
would
have
been
friends
for
life
but
i
know
that
it
struck
in
in
the
case
of
the
deacons
they
went
out
struggling
with
their
mirth
behind
their
pastor
back
i
think
he
restrained
himself
with
difficulty
from
pronouncing
the
major
excommunication
against
me
with
bell
book
and
candle
then
and
there
about
that
time
i
saw
advertised
for
sale
a
stereopticon
outfit
and
bought
it
without
any
definite
idea
of
what
to
do
with
it
i
suppose
it
ought
to
be
set
down
as
foolishness
and
a
waste
of
money
and
yet
it
was
to
play
an
important
part
in
the
real
that
was
waiting
for
me
without
the
knowledge
which
the
possession
of
it
gave
me
that
work
could
not
have
been
carried
out
as
it
was
that
is
not
to
say
that
i
recommend
every
man
to
have
a
magic
lantern
in
his
cellar
or
the
promiscuous
purchase
of
all
sorts
of
useless
things
as
though
the
world
were
a
kind
of
providential
rummage
sale
i
should
rather
say
that
no
effort
to
in
any
way
add
to
one
stock
of
knowledge
is
likely
to
come
amiss
in
this
world
of
changes
and
emergencies
and
that
providence
has
a
way
of
ranging
itself
on
the
side
of
the
man
with
the
strongest
battalions
of
resources
when
the
emergency
does
come
in
other
words
that
to
trust
god
and
keep
your
powder
dry
is
the
plan
for
all
time
the
process
of
keeping
mine
dry
came
near
blowing
up
the
house
my
two
friends
mackellar
and
wells
took
a
sympathetic
interest
in
the
lantern
proceedings
which
was
well
because
being
a
druggist
wells
knew
about
making
the
gas
and
could
prevent
trouble
on
that
tack
it
was
before
the
day
of
charged
tanks
the
gas
we
made
was
contained
in
rubber
bags
in
a
frame
with
weights
on
top
that
gave
the
necessary
pressure
mackellar
volunteered
to
be
the
weight
and
sat
on
the
bags
at
our
first
seance
while
wells
superintended
the
gas
and
i
read
the
written
directions
we
were
getting
along
nicely
when
i
came
to
a
place
enjoining
great
caution
in
the
distribution
of
the
weight
you
are
working
read
the
text
with
two
gases
which
if
allowed
to
mix
in
undue
proportion
have
the
force
and
all
the
destructive
power
of
a
bombshell
mackellar
all
ear
from
fidgeting
fell
into
a
tremble
on
his
perch
he
had
not
dreamed
of
this
neither
had
we
i
steadied
him
with
an
imperative
gesture
sit
still
i
commanded
listen
by
any
wabbling
of
the
rack
the
pressure
were
to
be
suddenly
relieved
the
gas
from
one
bag
might
be
sucked
into
the
other
with
the
result
of
a
disastrous
explosion
we
stood
regarding
each
other
in
dumb
horror
mackellar
was
deathly
pale
let
me
off
boys
he
pleaded
faintly
i
got
to
go
to
the
station
to
turn
out
the
men
he
made
a
motion
to
climb
down
wells
had
snatched
the
book
from
me
jack
for
your
life
move
he
cried
and
pointed
to
the
next
paragraph
in
the
directions
such
a
thing
has
happened
when
the
frame
has
been
upset
or
the
weight
in
some
other
way
suddenly
shifted
mac
sat
as
if
frozen
to
stone
ed
and
i
sneaked
out
of
the
back
door
on
tiptoe
to
make
for
downstairs
three
steps
at
a
time
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
we
were
back
each
with
an
armful
of
which
we
piled
up
beside
our
agonized
comrade
assuring
him
volubly
that
there
was
no
danger
if
he
would
only
sit
still
still
as
a
mouse
till
we
came
back
then
we
were
off
again
the
third
trip
gave
us
stones
enough
and
with
infinite
care
we
piled
them
one
after
another
upon
the
rack
as
the
captain
eased
up
until
at
last
he
stood
upon
the
floor
a
freed
and
saved
man
it
was
only
then
that
it
occurred
to
us
that
we
might
have
turned
off
the
gas
in
the
first
place
and
so
saved
ourselves
all
our
anguish
and
toil
i
can
say
honestly
that
i
tried
the
best
i
knew
how
to
get
along
with
the
politicians
i
served
but
in
the
long
run
it
simply
could
not
be
done
they
treated
me
fairly
bearing
no
grudges
but
it
is
one
thing
to
run
an
independent
newspaper
quite
another
to
edit
an
organ
and
there
is
no
deceiving
the
public
not
that
i
tried
indeed
if
anything
the
shoe
was
on
the
other
foot
we
parted
company
eventually
to
our
mutual
relief
and
quite
unexpectedly
i
found
my
lantern
turning
the
breadwinner
of
the
family
the
notion
of
using
it
as
a
means
of
advertising
had
long
allured
me
there
was
a
large
population
out
on
long
island
that
traded
in
brooklyn
stores
and
could
be
reached
in
that
way
in
fact
it
proved
to
be
so
i
made
money
that
fall
travelling
through
the
towns
and
villages
and
giving
exhibitions
in
which
the
ads
of
brooklyn
merchants
were
cunningly
interlarded
with
very
beautiful
colored
views
of
which
i
had
a
fine
collection
when
the
season
was
too
far
advanced
to
allow
of
this
i
established
myself
in
a
window
at
myrtle
avenue
and
fulton
street
and
appealed
to
the
city
crowds
with
my
pictures
so
i
filled
in
a
gap
of
several
months
while
our
people
on
the
other
side
crossed
themselves
at
my
having
turned
street
fakir
at
least
we
got
that
impression
from
their
letters
they
were
not
to
blame
that
is
their
way
of
looking
at
things
a
chief
reason
why
i
liked
this
country
from
the
very
beginning
was
that
it
made
no
difference
what
a
man
was
doing
so
long
as
it
was
some
honest
decent
work
i
liked
my
advertising
scheme
i
advertised
nothing
i
would
not
have
sold
the
people
myself
and
i
gave
it
to
them
in
a
way
that
was
distinctly
pleasing
and
good
for
them
for
my
pictures
were
real
work
of
art
not
the
cheap
trash
you
see
nowadays
on
street
screens
the
city
crowds
were
always
appreciative
in
the
country
the
hoodlums
made
trouble
occasionally
we
talk
a
great
deal
about
city
toughs
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
they
are
lads
of
normal
impulses
whose
resources
have
all
been
smothered
by
the
slum
of
whom
the
street
and
its
lawlessness
and
the
tenement
that
is
without
a
home
have
made
ruffians
with
better
opportunities
they
might
have
been
heroes
the
country
hoodlum
is
oftener
what
he
is
because
his
bent
is
that
way
though
he
too
is
not
rarely
driven
into
mischief
by
the
utter
poverty
aesthetically
i
mean
of
his
environment
hence
he
shows
off
in
his
isolation
so
much
worse
than
his
city
brother
it
is
no
argument
for
the
slum
it
makes
toughs
whereas
the
other
is
one
in
spite
of
his
country
home
that
is
to
say
if
the
latter
is
really
a
home
there
is
only
one
cure
then
an
almighty
thrashing
there
ought
to
be
some
left
in
flushing
to
echo
that
sentiment
even
after
a
quarter
of
a
century
from
certain
signs
i
knew
when
i
hung
my
curtain
between
two
trees
in
the
little
public
park
down
by
the
fountain
with
the
goldfish
that
there
was
going
to
be
trouble
my
patience
had
been
pretty
well
worn
down
and
i
made
preparations
i
hired
four
stout
men
who
were
spoiling
for
a
fight
and
put
good
hickory
clubs
into
their
hands
bidding
them
restrain
their
natural
desire
to
use
them
till
the
time
came
my
forebodings
were
not
vain
potatoes
turnips
and
eggs
flew
not
only
at
the
curtain
but
at
the
lantern
and
me
i
stood
it
until
the
castle
of
heidelberg
which
was
one
of
my
most
beautiful
colored
views
was
rent
in
twain
by
a
rock
that
went
clear
through
the
curtain
then
i
gave
the
word
in
a
trice
the
apparatus
was
gathered
up
and
thrown
into
a
wagon
that
was
waiting
the
horses
headed
for
jamaica
we
made
one
dash
into
the
crowd
and
a
wail
arose
from
the
bruised
and
bleeding
hoodlums
that
hung
over
the
town
like
a
nightmare
while
we
galloped
out
of
it
followed
by
cries
of
rage
and
a
mob
with
rocks
and
clubs
but
we
had
the
best
team
in
town
and
soon
lost
them
vengeance
no
of
course
there
was
the
ruined
curtain
and
those
eggs
to
be
settled
for
but
on
the
whole
i
think
we
were
a
kind
of
village
improvement
society
for
the
occasion
though
we
did
not
stay
to
wait
for
a
vote
of
thanks
i
am
sure
it
was
our
due
all
the
same
along
in
the
summer
of
wells
and
i
hatched
out
a
scheme
of
country
advertising
on
a
larger
scale
of
which
the
lantern
was
to
be
the
vehicle
we
were
to
publish
a
directory
of
the
city
of
elmira
how
we
came
to
select
that
city
i
have
forgotten
but
the
upshot
of
that
latest
of
my
business
ventures
i
am
not
likely
to
forget
soon
our
plan
was
to
boom
the
advertising
end
of
the
enterprise
by
a
nightly
street
display
in
the
interest
of
our
patrons
we
had
barely
got
into
town
when
the
railroad
strikes
of
that
memorable
summer
reached
elmira
there
had
been
dreadful
trouble
fire
and
bloodshed
in
pennsylvania
and
the
citizens
took
steps
at
once
to
preserve
the
peace
a
regiment
of
deputy
sheriffs
were
sworn
in
and
the
town
was
put
under
law
indeed
soldiers
with
fixed
bayonets
guarded
every
train
and
car
that
went
over
the
bridge
between
the
business
section
of
the
town
and
the
railroad
shops
across
the
chemung
river
our
ill
luck
or
good
when
a
thing
comes
upon
you
so
unexpectedly
as
did
that
i
am
rather
disposed
to
consider
it
a
stroke
of
good
fortune
however
disguised
would
have
it
that
the
building
we
had
chosen
to
hang
our
curtain
on
was
right
at
the
end
of
this
bridge
which
seemed
to
be
the
danger
point
from
the
other
end
the
strikers
looked
across
the
river
hourly
expected
to
make
a
movement
of
some
kind
exactly
what
i
do
know
i
know
that
the
whole
city
was
on
pins
and
needles
about
it
while
we
all
unconscious
that
we
were
the
object
of
sharp
scrutiny
were
vainly
trying
to
string
our
curtain
there
was
a
high
wind
that
blew
it
out
over
the
river
despite
all
our
efforts
to
catch
and
hold
it
twice
it
escaped
our
grasp
we
could
see
a
crowd
of
strikers
watching
us
on
the
other
side
the
deputies
who
held
our
end
of
the
bridge
saw
them
too
we
were
strangers
came
from
no
one
knew
where
they
must
have
concluded
that
we
were
in
league
with
the
enemy
and
signalling
to
him
when
for
the
third
time
our
big
white
flag
was
wafted
toward
the
shops
a
committee
of
citizens
came
up
from
the
street
and
let
us
know
in
as
few
words
as
possible
that
any
other
place
would
be
healthier
for
us
just
then
than
elmira
in
vain
we
protested
that
we
were
noncombatants
and
engaged
in
peaceful
industry
the
committee
pointed
to
the
flag
and
to
the
crowd
at
the
farther
end
of
the
bridge
they
eyed
our
preparations
for
making
gas
askance
and
politely
but
firmly
insisted
that
the
next
train
out
of
town
was
especially
suited
for
our
purpose
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
it
was
another
case
of
circumstantial
evidence
and
in
the
absence
of
backing
of
any
kind
we
did
the
only
thing
we
could
packed
up
and
went
it
was
not
a
time
for
trifling
the
slaughter
of
a
number
of
militiamen
in
a
pennsylvania
that
was
set
on
fire
by
the
strikers
was
fresh
in
the
public
mind
but
it
was
the
only
time
i
have
been
suspected
of
sympathy
with
violence
in
the
settlement
of
labor
disputes
the
trouble
with
that
plan
is
that
it
does
not
settle
anything
but
rakes
up
fresh
injuries
to
rankle
indefinitely
and
widen
the
gap
between
the
man
who
does
the
work
and
the
man
who
hires
it
done
so
that
he
may
have
time
to
attend
to
his
own
both
workmen
they
only
need
to
understand
each
other
and
their
common
interests
to
see
the
folly
of
quarrelling
to
do
that
they
must
know
one
another
but
a
blow
and
a
kick
are
a
poor
introduction
i
am
not
saying
that
the
provocation
is
not
sometimes
great
but
better
not
it
does
not
do
any
good
but
a
lot
of
harm
besides
if
we
have
got
to
the
point
yet
where
we
can
settle
our
disputes
peaceably
by
discussion
the
fault
is
not
all
the
employers
by
any
manner
of
means
we
jumped
out
of
the
ashes
into
the
fire
as
it
turned
out
at
scranton
our
train
was
held
up
there
were
torpedoes
on
the
track
rails
torn
up
or
something
for
want
of
something
better
to
do
we
went
out
to
take
a
look
at
the
town
at
the
head
of
the
main
street
was
a
big
crowd
untaught
by
experience
we
bored
our
way
through
it
to
where
a
line
of
men
with
guns
some
in
their
some
in
office
coats
some
in
dusters
were
blocking
advance
to
the
coal
company
stores
the
crowd
hung
sullenly
back
leaving
a
narrow
space
clear
in
front
of
the
line
within
it
a
man
i
learned
afterward
that
he
was
the
mayor
of
the
town
was
haranguing
the
people
counselling
them
to
go
back
to
their
homes
quietly
suddenly
a
brick
was
thrown
from
behind
me
and
struck
him
on
the
head
i
heard
a
word
of
brief
command
the
rattle
of
a
score
of
guns
falling
into
as
many
extended
hands
and
a
volley
was
fired
into
the
crowd
point
blank
a
man
beside
me
weltered
in
his
blood
there
was
an
instant
dead
silence
then
the
rushing
of
a
thousand
feet
and
wild
cries
of
terror
as
the
mob
broke
and
fled
we
ran
with
it
in
all
my
life
i
never
ran
so
fast
i
would
never
have
believed
that
i
could
do
it
ed
teased
me
to
the
day
of
his
death
about
it
insisting
that
one
might
have
played
marbles
on
my
they
flew
out
behind
so
but
he
was
an
easy
winner
in
that
race
the
riots
were
over
however
before
they
had
begun
and
perhaps
a
greater
calamity
was
averted
it
was
the
only
time
i
was
ever
under
fire
except
once
when
a
crazy
man
came
into
mulberry
street
years
after
and
pointed
a
revolver
at
the
reporters
i
regret
to
say
that
i
gave
no
better
account
of
myself
then
and
for
a
man
who
was
so
hot
to
go
to
war
i
own
it
is
a
bad
showing
perhaps
it
was
as
well
i
did
go
even
on
that
account
i
might
have
run
the
wrong
way
when
it
came
to
the
scratch
we
were
not
yet
done
suffering
undeserved
indignities
on
that
trip
for
when
we
got
as
far
as
stanhope
on
the
morris
and
essex
road
our
money
had
given
out
i
offered
the
my
watch
as
security
for
the
price
of
two
tickets
to
new
york
but
he
bestowed
only
a
contemptuous
glance
upon
it
and
remarked
that
there
were
a
good
many
fakirs
running
about
the
country
palming
off
snide
gold
watches
on
people
our
lantern
outfit
found
no
more
favor
with
him
and
we
were
compelled
to
tramp
it
to
the
village
in
mountains
where
my
wife
was
then
summering
with
our
baby
we
walked
all
night
and
when
at
dawn
we
arrived
had
the
mortification
of
being
held
up
by
the
farmer
dog
who
knew
nothing
about
us
he
walked
alongside
of
me
all
that
day
as
i
was
pushing
the
up
hill
eying
me
with
a
look
that
said
plainly
enough
i
had
better
not
make
a
move
to
sneak
away
with
the
child
wells
went
on
to
the
city
to
replenish
our
funds
and
here
i
take
leave
of
this
loyal
friend
in
the
story
of
my
life
a
better
one
i
never
had
he
lived
to
grow
rich
in
possessions
but
his
wealth
was
his
undoing
it
is
one
of
the
sore
spots
in
my
life
and
there
are
many
more
than
i
like
to
think
of
that
when
he
needed
me
most
i
was
not
able
to
be
to
him
what
i
would
and
should
have
been
we
had
drifted
too
far
apart
then
and
the
influence
i
had
over
him
once
i
had
myself
surrendered
it
was
so
with
charles
it
was
so
with
nicolai
they
come
sometimes
when
i
am
alone
and
nod
to
me
out
of
the
dim
past
you
were
not
tempted
you
should
have
helped
yes
god
help
me
it
is
true
i
am
more
to
blame
than
they
i
should
have
helped
and
did
not
what
would
i
not
give
that
i
could
unsay
that
now
two
of
them
died
by
their
own
hand
the
third
in
bloomingdale
i
had
been
making
several
attempts
to
get
a
foothold
on
one
of
the
metropolitan
newspapers
but
always
without
success
that
fall
i
tried
the
the
city
editor
of
which
shanks
was
one
of
my
neighbors
but
was
told
with
more
frankness
than
flattery
that
i
was
too
green
very
likely
shanks
had
been
observing
my
campaign
against
the
beats
and
thought
me
a
dangerous
man
in
those
days
of
big
libel
suits
i
should
have
done
the
same
thing
but
a
few
weeks
after
he
changed
his
mind
and
invited
me
to
come
on
the
paper
and
try
my
hand
so
i
joined
the
staff
of
the
five
years
after
its
great
editor
had
died
a
beaten
and
crushed
man
one
of
the
most
pathetic
figures
in
american
political
history
they
were
not
halcyon
days
those
winter
months
of
reporting
for
the
tribune
i
was
on
trial
and
it
was
hard
work
and
very
little
pay
not
enough
to
live
on
so
that
we
were
compelled
to
take
to
our
little
pile
to
make
ends
meet
but
there
was
always
a
bright
fire
and
a
cheery
welcome
for
me
at
home
so
what
did
it
matter
it
was
a
good
winter
despite
the
desperate
stunts
sometimes
set
me
reporters
on
general
work
do
not
sleep
on
flowery
beds
of
ease
i
remember
well
one
awful
night
when
word
came
of
a
dreadful
disaster
on
the
coney
island
shore
half
of
it
had
been
washed
away
by
the
sea
the
report
ran
with
houses
and
people
i
was
sent
out
to
get
at
the
truth
of
the
thing
i
started
in
the
early
twilight
and
got
as
far
as
gravesend
the
rest
of
the
way
i
had
to
foot
it
through
snow
and
slush
in
the
face
of
a
blinding
storm
and
got
to
sheepshead
bay
dead
beat
only
to
find
that
the
ice
and
the
tide
had
shut
off
all
approach
to
the
island
i
did
the
next
best
thing
i
gathered
from
the
of
the
bay
an
account
of
the
wreck
on
the
beach
that
lacked
nothing
in
vividness
thanks
to
their
laudable
desire
not
to
see
an
enterprising
reporter
cheated
out
of
his
rightful
space
then
i
hired
a
sleigh
and
drove
home
through
the
storm
wet
through
i
can
hear
the
water
yet
running
out
of
your
boots
says
my
wife
wet
through
and
nearly
frozen
stiff
but
tingling
with
pride
at
my
feat
the
next
day
was
the
only
paper
that
had
an
account
of
the
tidal
wave
on
the
island
but
something
about
it
did
not
seem
to
strike
the
city
editor
just
right
there
was
an
unwonted
suavity
in
his
summons
when
he
called
me
to
his
desk
which
i
had
learned
to
dread
as
liable
to
conceal
some
fatal
thrust
so
you
went
to
the
island
last
night
riis
he
observed
regarding
me
over
the
edge
of
the
paper
no
sir
i
could
get
across
nobody
could
eh
he
lowered
the
paper
an
inch
and
took
a
better
look
this
very
circumstantial
account
was
gathered
from
the
in
sheepshead
bay
who
had
seen
it
all
if
there
had
been
a
boat
not
stove
by
the
ice
i
would
have
got
across
somehow
shanks
dropped
the
paper
and
considered
me
almost
kindly
i
saw
that
he
had
my
bill
for
the
in
his
hand
right
he
said
we
allow
the
sleigh
we
allow
even
the
stove
to
a
man
who
owns
he
did
see
it
though
it
is
pretty
steep
he
pointed
to
a
paragraph
which
described
how
after
the
wreck
of
the
watchman
shanty
the
kitchen
stove
floated
ashore
with
the
alive
and
safe
upon
it
i
still
believe
that
an
unfriendly
printer
played
me
that
trick
next
time
he
added
dismissing
me
make
them
swear
to
the
stove
there
is
no
accounting
for
cats
but
though
i
did
not
hear
the
last
of
it
in
the
office
for
a
long
time
i
know
that
my
measure
was
taken
by
the
desk
that
day
i
was
trusted
after
that
even
though
i
had
made
a
mistake
in
spite
of
it
i
did
not
get
on
there
was
not
a
living
in
it
for
me
that
was
made
plain
enough
we
were
too
many
doing
general
work
after
six
months
of
hard
grubbing
i
decided
that
i
had
better
seek
my
fortune
elsewhere
spring
was
coming
and
it
seemed
a
waste
of
time
to
stay
where
i
was
i
wrote
out
my
resignation
and
left
it
on
the
city
editor
desk
some
errand
took
me
out
of
the
office
when
i
returned
it
lay
there
still
unopened
i
saw
it
and
thought
i
would
try
another
week
i
might
make
a
strike
so
i
took
the
note
away
and
tore
it
up
just
as
shanks
entered
the
room
that
evening
it
set
in
snowing
at
a
great
rate
i
had
been
uptown
on
a
late
assignment
and
was
coming
across
square
running
at
top
speed
to
catch
the
edition
the
wind
did
its
part
there
is
no
corner
in
all
new
york
where
it
blows
as
it
does
around
the
tribune
building
as
i
flew
into
spruce
street
i
brought
up
smack
against
two
men
coming
out
of
the
side
door
one
of
them
i
knocked
off
his
feet
into
a
snowdrift
he
floundered
about
in
it
and
swore
dreadfully
by
the
voice
i
knew
that
it
was
shanks
i
stood
petrified
mechanically
pinning
his
slouch
hat
to
the
ground
with
my
toe
he
got
upon
his
feet
at
last
and
came
toward
me
much
wrought
up
who
in
thunder
he
growled
angrily
and
caught
sight
of
my
rueful
face
i
was
thinking
i
might
as
well
have
left
my
note
on
his
desk
that
morning
for
now
i
was
going
to
be
discharged
anyhow
is
that
the
way
you
treat
your
city
editor
riis
he
asked
while
i
handed
him
his
hat
it
was
the
wind
sir
and
i
was
running
running
what
is
up
that
set
you
going
at
that
rate
i
told
him
of
the
meeting
i
had
attended
it
was
of
no
account
and
that
i
was
running
to
catch
the
edition
he
heard
me
out
and
do
you
always
run
like
that
when
you
are
out
on
assignments
when
it
is
late
like
this
yes
how
else
would
i
get
my
copy
in
well
just
take
a
reef
in
when
you
round
the
corner
he
said
brushing
the
snow
from
his
clothes
do
run
your
city
editor
down
again
and
he
went
his
way
it
was
with
anxious
forebodings
i
went
to
the
office
the
next
morning
shanks
was
there
before
me
he
was
dictating
to
his
secretary
taggart
who
had
been
witness
of
the
collision
of
the
night
before
when
i
came
in
presently
i
was
summoned
to
his
desk
and
went
there
with
sinking
heart
things
had
commenced
to
look
up
a
bit
in
the
last
hours
and
i
had
hoped
yet
to
make
it
go
now
it
was
all
over
riis
he
began
stiffly
you
knocked
me
down
last
night
without
cause
yes
sir
but
i
illustration
mulberry
street
into
a
snowdrift
he
went
on
unheeding
nice
thing
for
a
reporter
to
do
to
his
commanding
officer
now
sir
this
will
not
do
we
must
find
some
way
of
preventing
it
in
the
future
our
man
at
police
headquarters
has
left
i
am
going
to
send
you
up
there
in
his
place
you
can
run
there
all
you
want
to
and
you
will
want
to
all
you
can
it
is
a
place
that
needs
a
man
who
will
run
to
get
his
copy
in
and
tell
the
truth
and
stick
to
it
you
will
find
plenty
of
fighting
there
but
do
go
knocking
people
down
unless
you
have
to
and
with
this
kind
of
an
introduction
i
was
sent
off
to
mulberry
street
where
i
was
to
find
my
it
is
years
since
the
day
i
took
my
first
walk
up
there
and
looked
over
the
ground
that
has
since
become
so
familiar
to
me
i
knew
it
by
reputation
as
the
hardest
place
on
the
paper
and
it
was
in
no
spirit
of
exultation
that
i
looked
out
upon
the
stirring
life
of
the
block
if
the
truth
be
told
i
think
i
was
if
anything
a
bit
afraid
the
story
of
the
big
fight
the
reporter
was
having
on
his
hands
up
there
with
all
the
other
papers
had
long
been
echoing
through
newspaperdom
and
i
was
not
deceived
but
after
all
i
had
been
doing
little
else
myself
and
having
given
no
offence
my
cause
would
be
just
in
which
case
what
had
i
to
fear
so
in
my
soul
i
commended
my
work
and
myself
to
the
god
of
battles
who
gives
victory
and
took
hold
right
here
lest
i
make
myself
appear
better
than
i
am
i
want
to
say
that
i
am
not
a
praying
man
in
the
sense
of
being
versed
in
the
language
of
prayer
or
anything
of
that
kind
i
wish
i
were
so
i
might
have
been
better
able
to
serve
my
unhappy
friends
when
they
needed
me
indeed
those
who
have
known
me
under
strong
provocation
provocation
is
strong
in
mulberry
street
would
scorn
such
an
intimation
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
with
cause
i
was
once
a
deacon
but
they
did
not
often
let
me
lead
in
prayer
my
supplications
ordinarily
take
the
form
of
putting
the
case
plainly
to
him
who
is
the
source
of
all
right
and
all
justice
and
leaving
it
so
if
i
were
to
find
that
i
could
not
do
that
i
should
decline
to
go
into
the
fight
or
if
i
had
to
should
feel
that
i
were
to
be
justly
beaten
in
all
the
years
of
my
reporting
i
have
never
omitted
this
when
anything
big
was
on
foot
whether
a
fire
a
murder
a
robbery
or
whatever
might
come
in
the
way
of
duty
and
i
have
never
heard
that
my
reports
were
any
the
worse
for
it
i
know
they
were
better
perhaps
the
notion
of
a
police
reporter
praying
that
he
may
write
a
good
murder
story
may
seem
ludicrous
even
irreverent
to
some
people
but
that
is
only
because
they
fail
to
make
out
in
it
the
human
element
which
dignifies
anything
and
rescues
it
from
reproach
unless
i
could
go
to
my
story
that
way
i
would
not
go
to
it
at
all
i
am
very
sure
that
there
is
no
irreverence
in
it
just
the
reverse
so
i
dived
in
but
before
i
did
it
i
telegraphed
to
my
wife
got
staff
appointment
police
headquarters
a
week
hurrah
i
knew
it
would
make
her
happy
chapter
ix
life
in
mulberry
street
it
was
well
that
i
stopped
to
make
explanations
before
i
took
hold
in
my
new
office
mighty
little
time
was
left
me
after
what
the
fight
was
about
to
which
i
fell
heir
i
have
long
since
forgotten
mulberry
street
in
those
days
was
prone
to
such
things
somebody
was
always
fighting
somebody
else
for
some
fancied
injury
or
act
of
bad
faith
in
the
gathering
of
the
news
for
the
time
being
they
all
made
common
cause
against
the
reporter
of
the
who
also
represented
the
local
bureau
of
the
associated
press
they
hailed
the
coming
of
the
dutchman
with
shouts
of
derision
and
decided
i
suppose
to
finish
me
off
while
i
was
new
so
they
pulled
themselves
together
for
an
effort
and
within
a
week
i
was
so
badly
beaten
in
the
police
department
in
the
health
department
in
the
fire
department
the
coroner
office
and
the
excise
bureau
all
of
which
it
was
my
task
to
cover
that
the
manager
of
the
press
bureau
called
me
down
to
look
me
over
he
reported
to
the
that
he
did
not
think
i
would
do
but
shanks
told
him
to
wait
and
see
in
some
way
i
heard
of
it
and
that
settled
it
that
i
was
to
win
i
might
be
beaten
in
many
a
battle
but
how
could
i
lose
the
fight
with
a
general
like
that
and
indeed
in
another
week
it
was
their
turn
to
be
called
down
to
give
an
account
of
themselves
the
dutchman
had
stolen
a
march
on
them
i
suppose
it
was
to
them
a
very
astounding
thing
yet
it
was
perfectly
simple
their
very
strength
as
they
held
it
to
be
was
their
weakness
they
were
a
dozen
against
one
and
each
one
of
them
took
it
for
granted
that
the
other
eleven
were
attending
to
business
and
that
he
need
not
exert
himself
overmuch
a
good
many
years
after
i
had
that
experience
as
a
member
of
a
board
of
twelve
trustees
each
one
of
whom
had
lent
his
name
but
not
his
work
to
the
cause
we
were
supposed
to
represent
when
we
met
at
the
end
of
that
season
and
heard
how
narrow
had
been
the
escape
from
calamity
due
to
utter
lack
of
management
a
good
methodist
brother
put
in
words
what
we
were
each
and
every
one
of
us
thinking
about
brethren
he
said
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
but
for
the
interposition
of
a
merciful
providence
we
should
all
be
in
jail
as
we
deserve
let
us
pray
i
think
that
prayer
was
more
than
with
most
of
us
i
know
that
i
registered
a
vow
that
i
would
never
again
be
trustee
of
anything
without
trusteeing
it
in
fact
and
i
have
kept
the
vow
illustration
police
bureau
but
to
return
to
mulberry
street
the
immediate
result
of
this
first
victory
of
mine
was
a
whirlwind
onslaught
on
me
fiercer
than
anything
that
had
gone
before
i
expected
it
and
met
it
as
well
as
i
could
holding
my
own
after
a
fashion
when
from
sheer
exhaustion
they
let
up
to
see
if
i
was
still
there
i
paid
them
back
with
two
or
three
beats
i
had
stored
up
for
the
occasion
and
then
we
settled
down
to
the
ten
years
war
for
the
mastery
out
of
which
i
was
to
come
at
last
fairly
the
victor
and
with
the
only
renown
i
have
ever
coveted
or
cared
to
have
that
of
being
the
boss
reporter
in
mulberry
street
i
have
so
often
been
asked
in
later
years
what
my
work
was
there
footnote
i
say
was
only
in
the
last
twelvemonth
have
i
grasped
dana
meaning
in
calling
his
reporters
his
young
men
they
need
to
be
that
i
for
one
have
grown
too
old
and
how
i
found
there
the
point
of
view
from
which
i
wrote
my
books
that
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
go
somewhat
into
the
details
of
it
the
police
reporter
on
a
newspaper
then
is
the
one
who
gathers
and
handles
all
the
news
that
means
trouble
to
some
one
the
murders
fires
suicides
robberies
and
all
that
sort
before
it
gets
into
court
he
has
an
office
in
mulberry
street
across
from
police
headquarters
where
he
receives
the
first
intimation
of
the
trouble
through
the
precinct
reports
or
else
he
does
not
receive
it
the
police
do
not
like
to
tell
the
public
of
a
robbery
or
a
safe
cracking
for
instance
they
claim
that
it
interferes
with
the
ends
of
justice
what
they
really
mean
is
that
it
brings
ridicule
or
censure
upon
them
to
have
the
public
know
that
they
do
not
catch
every
thief
or
even
most
of
them
they
would
like
that
impression
to
go
out
for
police
work
is
largely
a
game
of
bluff
here
then
is
an
opportunity
for
the
beats
i
speak
of
the
reporter
who
through
acquaintance
friendship
or
natural
detective
skill
can
get
that
which
it
is
the
policy
of
the
police
to
conceal
from
him
wins
it
may
seem
to
many
a
reader
a
matter
of
no
great
importance
if
a
man
should
miss
a
for
his
paper
but
reporting
is
a
business
a
very
exacting
one
at
that
and
if
he
will
stop
a
moment
and
think
what
it
is
he
instinctively
looks
at
first
in
his
morning
paper
even
if
he
has
schooled
himself
not
to
read
it
through
he
will
see
it
differently
the
fact
is
that
it
is
all
a
great
human
drama
in
which
these
things
are
the
acts
that
mean
grief
suffering
revenge
upon
somebody
loss
or
gain
the
reporter
who
is
behind
the
scenes
sees
the
tumult
of
passions
and
not
rarely
a
human
heroism
that
redeems
all
the
rest
it
is
his
task
so
to
portray
it
that
we
can
all
see
its
meaning
or
at
all
events
catch
the
human
drift
of
it
not
merely
the
foulness
and
the
reek
of
blood
if
he
can
do
that
he
has
performed
a
signal
service
and
his
murder
story
may
easily
come
to
speak
more
eloquently
to
the
minds
of
thousands
than
the
sermon
preached
to
a
hundred
in
the
church
on
sunday
illustration
in
which
lay
dying
a
french
nobleman
of
proud
and
ancient
name
of
the
advantages
that
smooth
the
way
to
i
had
none
i
was
a
stranger
and
i
was
never
distinguished
for
detective
ability
but
good
hard
work
goes
a
long
way
toward
making
up
for
lack
of
genius
and
i
mentioned
only
one
of
the
opportunities
for
getting
ahead
of
my
opponents
they
were
lying
all
about
us
any
seemingly
innocent
slip
sent
out
from
the
police
telegraph
office
across
the
way
recording
a
petty
fire
might
hide
a
who
always
makes
shuddering
appeal
to
our
fears
the
finding
of
john
jones
sick
and
destitute
in
the
street
meant
perhaps
a
story
full
of
the
deepest
pathos
indeed
i
can
think
of
a
dozen
now
that
did
i
see
before
me
as
though
it
were
yesterday
the
desolate
wooster
street
attic
with
wind
and
rain
sweeping
through
the
bare
room
in
which
lay
dying
a
french
nobleman
of
proud
and
ancient
name
the
last
of
his
house
he
was
one
of
my
early
triumphs
new
york
is
a
queer
town
the
grist
of
every
hopper
in
the
world
comes
to
it
i
shall
not
soon
forget
the
gloomy
tenement
in
clinton
street
where
that
day
a
poor
shoemaker
had
shot
himself
his
name
struensee
had
brought
me
over
i
knew
there
could
not
be
such
another
that
was
where
my
danish
birth
stood
me
in
good
stead
i
knew
the
story
of
christian
vii
masterful
minister
of
his
fall
and
trial
on
the
charge
of
supplanting
his
master
in
the
affections
of
the
young
and
beautiful
queen
sister
of
george
iii
very
old
men
told
yet
when
i
was
a
boy
of
that
dark
day
when
the
proud
head
fell
under
the
executioner
axe
in
the
castle
square
dark
for
the
people
whose
champion
struensee
had
tried
to
be
my
mother
was
born
and
reared
in
the
castle
at
elsinore
where
the
unhappy
queen
disgraced
and
an
outcast
wrote
on
the
of
her
prison
cell
lord
keep
me
innocent
make
others
great
it
was
all
a
familiar
story
to
me
and
when
i
sat
beside
that
dead
shoemaker
and
looking
through
his
papers
read
there
that
the
tragedy
of
a
hundred
years
before
was
his
family
story
i
knew
that
i
held
in
my
hands
the
means
of
paying
off
all
accumulated
scores
to
date
did
i
settle
in
full
yes
i
did
i
was
in
a
fight
not
of
my
own
choosing
and
i
was
well
aware
that
my
turn
was
coming
i
hit
as
hard
as
i
knew
how
and
so
did
they
when
i
speak
of
triumphs
it
is
professionally
there
was
no
about
it
we
did
not
gloat
over
the
misfortunes
we
described
we
were
reporters
not
ghouls
there
lies
before
me
as
i
write
a
letter
that
came
in
the
mail
this
afternoon
from
a
woman
who
bitterly
objects
to
my
diagnosis
of
the
reporter
as
the
highest
and
noblest
of
all
callings
she
signs
herself
a
sufferer
from
reporters
unkindness
and
tells
me
how
in
the
hour
of
her
deep
affliction
they
have
trodden
upon
her
heart
can
i
not
she
asks
encourage
a
public
sentiment
that
will
make
such
reporting
disreputable
all
my
life
i
have
tried
to
do
so
and
in
spite
of
the
evidence
of
yellow
journalism
to
the
contrary
i
think
we
are
coming
nearer
to
that
ideal
in
other
words
we
are
emerging
from
savagery
striving
madly
for
each
other
scalps
as
we
were
i
do
not
think
that
we
scalped
any
one
else
unjustly
i
know
i
did
not
they
were
not
particularly
scrupulous
i
am
bound
to
say
in
their
rage
and
mortification
at
having
underestimated
the
enemy
they
did
things
unworthy
of
men
and
of
reporters
they
stole
my
slips
in
the
telegraph
office
and
substituted
others
that
sent
me
off
on
a
chase
to
the
farthest
river
wards
in
the
midnight
hour
thinking
so
to
tire
me
out
but
they
did
it
once
too
often
i
happened
on
a
very
important
case
on
such
a
trip
and
made
the
most
of
it
telegraphing
down
a
column
or
more
about
it
from
the
office
while
the
enemy
watched
me
helplessly
from
the
headquarters
stoop
across
the
way
they
were
gathered
there
waiting
for
me
to
come
back
and
received
me
with
loud
and
mocking
ahems
and
respectfully
sympathetic
toots
on
a
tin
horn
kept
for
that
purpose
its
voice
had
a
mournful
strain
in
it
that
was
especially
exasperating
but
when
without
paying
any
attention
to
them
i
busied
myself
with
the
wire
at
once
and
kept
at
it
right
along
they
scented
trouble
and
consulted
anxiously
among
themselves
my
story
finished
i
went
out
and
sat
on
my
own
stoop
and
said
ahem
in
my
turn
in
as
many
aggravating
ways
as
i
could
they
knew
they
were
beaten
then
and
shortly
they
had
confirmation
of
it
the
report
came
in
from
the
precinct
at
but
it
was
then
too
late
for
their
papers
for
there
were
no
telephones
in
those
days
i
had
the
only
telegraph
wire
after
that
they
gave
up
such
tricks
and
the
saved
many
cab
fares
at
night
for
there
were
no
elevated
railroads
either
in
those
days
or
electric
or
cable
cars
on
the
other
hand
this
enterprise
of
ours
was
often
of
the
highest
service
to
the
public
when
for
instance
in
following
up
a
case
of
destitution
and
illness
involving
a
whole
family
i
tracing
back
the
origin
of
it
came
upon
a
party
at
which
ham
sandwiches
had
been
the
bill
of
fare
and
upon
looking
up
the
guests
found
seventeen
of
the
sick
with
identical
symptoms
it
required
no
medical
knowledge
but
merely
the
ordinary
information
and
training
of
the
reporter
to
diagnose
trichinosis
the
seventeen
had
half
a
dozen
different
doctors
who
knowing
nothing
of
party
or
ham
were
helpless
and
saw
only
cases
of
rheumatism
or
such
like
i
called
as
many
of
them
as
i
could
reach
together
that
night
introduced
them
to
one
another
and
to
my
facts
and
asked
them
what
they
thought
then
what
they
thought
made
a
sensation
in
my
paper
the
next
morning
and
practically
decided
the
fight
though
the
enemy
was
able
to
spoil
my
relish
for
the
ham
by
reporting
the
poisoning
of
a
whole
family
with
a
dish
of
depraved
smelt
while
i
was
chasing
up
the
trichinae
however
i
had
my
revenge
i
walked
in
that
afternoon
upon
cyrus
edson
at
his
microscope
surrounded
by
my
adversaries
who
besought
him
to
deny
my
story
the
doctor
looked
quizzically
at
them
and
made
reply
i
would
like
to
oblige
you
boys
but
how
i
can
do
it
with
those
fellows
squirming
under
the
microscope
i
do
see
i
took
them
from
the
flesh
of
one
of
the
patients
who
was
sent
to
trinity
hospital
look
at
them
yourself
he
winked
at
me
and
peering
into
his
microscope
i
saw
my
diagnosis
more
than
confirmed
there
were
scores
of
the
little
beasts
curled
up
and
burrowing
in
the
speck
of
tissue
the
unhappy
patient
died
that
week
we
had
our
specialties
in
this
contest
of
wits
one
was
distinguished
as
a
sleuth
he
fed
on
detective
mysteries
as
a
cat
on
a
he
thought
them
out
by
day
and
dreamed
them
out
by
night
to
the
great
exasperation
of
the
official
detectives
with
whom
their
solution
was
a
commercial
not
in
the
least
an
intellectual
affair
they
solved
them
on
the
plane
of
the
proverbial
lack
of
honor
among
thieves
by
the
formula
you
scratch
my
back
and
i
scratch
yours
another
came
out
strong
on
fires
he
knew
the
history
of
every
house
in
town
that
ran
any
risk
of
being
burned
knew
every
fireman
and
could
tell
within
a
thousand
dollars
more
or
less
what
was
the
value
of
the
goods
stored
in
any
building
in
the
district
and
for
how
much
they
were
insured
if
he
could
he
did
anyhow
and
his
guesses
often
came
near
the
fact
as
shown
in
the
final
adjustment
he
sniffed
a
firebug
from
afar
and
knew
without
asking
how
much
salvage
there
was
in
a
bale
of
cotton
after
being
hours
in
the
fire
he
is
dead
poor
fellow
in
life
he
was
fond
of
a
joke
and
in
death
the
joke
clung
to
him
in
a
way
wholly
unforeseen
the
firemen
in
the
next
block
with
whom
he
made
his
headquarters
when
off
duty
so
that
he
might
always
be
within
hearing
of
the
gong
wished
to
give
some
tangible
evidence
of
their
regard
for
the
old
reporter
but
being
in
a
hurry
left
it
to
the
florist
who
knew
him
well
to
choose
the
design
he
hit
upon
a
floral
as
the
proper
thing
and
thus
it
was
that
when
the
company
of
mourners
was
assembled
and
the
funeral
service
in
progress
there
arrived
and
was
set
upon
the
coffin
in
the
view
of
all
that
triumph
of
the
florist
art
a
shield
of
white
roses
with
this
legend
written
across
it
in
red
immortelles
admit
within
fire
lines
only
it
was
shocking
but
irresistible
it
brought
down
even
the
house
of
mourning
the
incident
recalls
another
which
at
the
time
caused
me
no
little
astonishment
a
telegram
from
long
branch
had
announced
the
drowning
of
a
young
actor
i
think
whose
three
sisters
lived
over
on
eighth
avenue
i
had
gone
to
the
house
to
learn
about
the
accident
and
found
them
in
the
first
burst
of
grief
dissolved
in
tears
it
was
a
very
hot
july
day
and
to
guard
against
sunstroke
i
had
put
a
in
my
hat
on
the
way
over
i
forgot
all
about
it
and
the
leaf
getting
limp
settled
down
snugly
upon
my
head
like
a
ridiculous
green
skullcap
knowing
nothing
of
this
i
was
wholly
unprepared
for
the
effect
my
entrance
hatless
had
upon
the
weeping
family
the
young
ladies
ceased
crying
stared
wildly
and
then
to
my
utter
bewilderment
broke
into
hysterical
laughter
for
the
moment
i
thought
they
had
gone
mad
it
was
only
when
in
my
perplexity
i
put
up
my
hand
to
rub
my
head
that
i
came
upon
the
cause
of
the
strange
hilarity
for
years
afterward
the
thought
of
it
had
the
same
effect
upon
me
that
the
produced
so
unexpectedly
in
that
home
i
might
fill
many
pages
with
such
stories
but
i
shall
not
attempt
it
do
they
seem
mean
and
trifling
in
the
retrospect
not
at
all
they
were
my
work
and
i
liked
it
and
i
got
a
good
deal
of
fun
out
of
it
from
time
to
time
i
mind
bryant
parrot
story
joseph
bryant
was
health
commissioner
at
the
time
and
though
we
rarely
agreed
about
anything
there
is
something
curious
about
that
that
the
men
i
have
thought
most
of
were
quite
often
those
with
whom
i
disagreed
ordinarily
about
everything
i
can
say
truly
that
there
have
been
few
better
health
commissioners
and
none
for
whom
i
have
had
a
more
hearty
respect
and
liking
bryant
especially
hated
reporters
he
wras
built
that
way
he
disliked
notoriety
for
himself
and
his
friends
and
therefore
when
one
of
these
complained
of
a
neighbor
parrot
to
the
health
department
he
gave
strict
orders
that
the
story
was
to
be
guarded
from
the
reporters
and
particularly
from
me
who
had
grieved
him
more
than
once
by
publishing
things
which
in
his
opinion
i
ought
to
have
said
nothing
about
i
heard
of
it
within
the
hour
and
promptly
set
my
wit
against
the
doctor
to
unearth
the
parrot
illustration
our
office
my
partner
ensign
at
the
desk
i
in
the
corner
but
it
would
not
come
out
dig
as
i
might
i
could
not
get
at
it
i
tried
every
way
while
the
doctor
laughed
in
his
sleeve
and
beamed
upon
me
at
last
in
desperation
i
hit
upon
a
bold
plan
i
would
get
it
out
of
the
doctor
himself
i
knew
his
hours
for
coming
to
sanitary
headquarters
from
his
clinics
i
suppose
he
always
came
up
the
stairs
absorbed
in
thought
noticing
nothing
that
passed
i
waylaid
him
in
the
turn
of
the
dark
hall
and
before
he
had
time
to
think
plumped
at
him
an
oh
doctor
about
that
parrot
of
your
friend
er
er
oh
what
was
his
name
alley
said
the
doctor
mechanically
and
went
in
only
half
hearing
what
i
said
i
made
for
the
city
directory
there
were
four
alleys
in
it
in
an
hour
i
had
located
my
man
and
the
next
morning
had
a
column
account
of
the
tragedy
of
the
parrot
the
doctor
was
very
angry
he
went
to
headquarters
and
summoned
me
solemnly
before
the
assembled
board
the
time
had
come
he
said
to
have
an
explanation
from
me
as
to
who
it
was
that
gave
me
information
against
orders
and
the
public
interest
evidently
there
was
a
traitor
in
camp
by
whatever
means
i
had
procured
his
treachery
in
vain
did
i
try
to
show
the
doctor
how
unprofessional
my
conduct
would
be
in
betraying
my
informant
even
how
contemptible
he
was
inexorable
this
time
i
should
not
escape
nor
my
accomplice
either
out
with
it
and
at
once
with
a
show
of
regretful
resignation
i
gave
in
for
once
i
would
break
my
rule
and
tell
on
my
informant
i
thought
i
detected
a
slight
sneer
on
the
lip
as
he
said
that
was
well
for
he
was
a
gentleman
every
inch
of
him
and
i
know
he
hated
me
for
telling
the
other
commissioners
looked
grave
well
then
i
said
the
man
who
gave
me
the
parrot
story
was
you
dr
bryant
the
doctor
sat
bolt
upright
with
a
jerk
no
bad
jokes
riis
he
said
who
gave
you
the
story
why
you
did
do
you
remember
and
i
told
how
i
waylaid
him
in
the
hall
his
face
as
the
narrative
ran
on
was
a
study
anger
mirth
offended
pride
struggled
there
but
the
humor
of
the
thing
got
the
upper
hand
in
the
end
and
the
one
who
laughed
loudest
in
the
board
room
was
bryant
himself
in
my
soul
i
believe
that
he
was
not
a
little
relieved
for
under
a
manner
of
much
sternness
he
had
the
tenderest
of
hearts
but
it
was
not
always
i
who
came
out
ahead
in
the
daily
encounters
which
made
up
the
routine
of
my
day
it
was
an
important
part
of
my
task
to
be
on
such
terms
with
the
heads
of
departments
that
they
would
talk
freely
to
us
so
that
we
might
know
in
any
given
case
or
with
reference
to
the
policy
of
the
department
where
we
were
at
i
do
not
mean
talk
for
publication
it
is
a
common
mistake
of
people
who
know
nothing
about
the
newspaper
profession
that
reporters
flit
about
public
men
like
so
many
hawks
seizing
upon
what
they
can
find
to
publish
as
their
lawful
prey
no
doubt
there
are
such
guerrillas
and
they
have
occasionally
more
than
justified
their
existence
but
as
applied
to
the
staff
reporters
of
a
great
newspaper
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth
the
department
reporter
has
his
field
as
carefully
laid
out
for
him
every
day
as
any
physician
who
starts
out
on
his
route
and
within
that
field
if
he
is
the
right
sort
of
man
he
is
friend
companion
and
often
counsellor
to
the
officials
with
whom
he
comes
in
contact
always
supposing
that
he
is
not
fighting
them
in
open
war
he
may
serve
a
republican
paper
and
the
president
of
the
police
board
may
be
a
democrat
of
democrats
yet
in
the
privacy
of
his
office
he
will
talk
as
freely
to
the
reporter
as
if
he
were
his
most
intimate
party
friend
knowing
that
he
will
not
publish
what
is
said
in
confidence
this
is
the
reporter
capital
without
which
he
can
not
in
the
long
run
do
business
i
presume
he
is
sometimes
tempted
to
gamble
with
it
for
a
stake
i
remember
well
when
the
temptation
came
to
me
once
after
a
quiet
hour
with
police
commissioner
matthews
who
had
been
telling
me
the
inside
history
of
an
affair
which
just
then
was
setting
the
whole
town
by
the
ears
i
told
him
that
i
thought
i
should
have
to
print
it
it
was
too
good
to
keep
no
it
would
do
he
said
i
knew
well
enough
he
was
right
but
i
insisted
the
chance
was
too
good
a
one
to
miss
matthews
shook
his
head
he
was
an
invalid
and
was
taking
his
daily
treatment
with
an
electric
battery
while
we
talked
and
smoked
he
warned
me
laughingly
against
the
consequences
of
what
i
proposed
to
do
and
changed
the
subject
ever
try
these
he
said
giving
me
the
handles
i
took
them
unsuspecting
and
felt
the
current
tingle
in
my
the
next
instant
it
gripped
me
like
a
vice
i
squirmed
with
pain
stop
i
yelled
and
tried
to
throw
the
things
away
but
my
hands
crooked
themselves
about
them
like
a
bird
claws
and
held
them
fast
they
would
not
let
go
i
looked
at
the
commissioner
he
was
studying
the
battery
leisurely
and
slowly
pulling
out
the
plug
that
increased
the
current
for
mercy
sake
stop
i
called
to
him
he
looked
up
inquiringly
about
that
interview
now
he
drawled
do
you
think
you
ought
to
print
wow
wow
let
go
i
tell
you
it
hurt
dreadfully
he
pulled
the
thing
out
another
peg
you
know
it
would
do
really
now
if
he
made
as
if
to
still
further
increase
the
current
i
surrendered
let
up
i
begged
and
i
will
not
say
a
word
only
let
up
he
set
me
free
he
never
spoke
of
it
once
in
all
the
years
i
knew
him
but
now
and
again
he
would
offer
me
with
a
dry
smile
the
use
of
his
battery
as
very
good
for
the
health
i
always
declined
with
thanks
illustration
about
that
interview
now
he
drawled
i
got
into
mulberry
street
at
what
might
well
be
called
the
heroic
age
of
police
reporting
it
rang
still
with
the
echoes
of
the
unfathomed
charley
ross
mystery
that
year
occurred
the
stewart
grave
robbery
and
the
manhattan
bank
burglary
three
crimes
that
each
in
its
way
made
a
sensation
such
as
new
york
has
not
known
since
for
though
charley
ross
was
stolen
in
philadelphia
the
search
for
him
centered
in
the
metropolis
the
burglary
within
the
shadow
of
police
headquarters
gave
us
inspector
byrnes
who
broke
up
the
old
gangs
of
crooks
and
drove
those
whom
he
did
not
put
in
jail
over
the
sea
to
ply
their
trade
in
europe
the
stewart
grave
robbery
ended
the
career
of
the
ghouls
and
the
charley
ross
case
put
a
stop
to
for
a
generation
by
making
those
crimes
unprofitable
the
public
excitement
was
so
great
that
it
proved
impossible
for
the
thieves
to
deliver
the
goods
and
effect
the
change
for
ransom
at
intervals
for
years
these
cases
kept
turning
up
in
one
new
phase
or
another
you
could
never
tell
where
to
look
for
them
indeed
i
have
to
thank
the
stewart
ghouls
for
the
first
public
recognition
that
came
to
me
in
those
early
years
of
toil
of
all
the
mysteries
that
ever
vexed
a
reporter
soul
that
was
the
most
agonizing
the
police
most
of
the
time
were
as
much
in
the
dark
as
the
rest
of
us
and
nothing
was
to
be
got
from
that
source
heaven
knows
i
tried
in
our
desperation
we
caught
at
every
straw
one
stormy
night
in
the
hottest
of
the
excitement
judge
hilton
who
had
offered
the
reward
for
the
stolen
body
on
behalf
of
stewart
went
to
headquarters
and
stayed
an
hour
in
the
detective
office
when
he
came
out
he
was
attended
by
two
of
the
oldest
and
ablest
detectives
clearly
something
big
was
on
foot
they
were
just
like
so
many
sphinxes
and
went
straight
to
the
carriage
that
waited
at
the
mulberry
street
door
i
do
not
know
how
it
ever
entered
my
head
perhaps
it
at
all
but
was
just
done
mechanically
the
wind
had
blown
out
the
lamp
on
the
steps
and
the
street
was
in
profound
darkness
as
they
stepped
into
the
carriage
i
with
only
the
notion
in
my
head
that
here
was
news
which
must
be
got
somehow
went
in
last
and
sank
down
in
the
vacant
seat
pulling
the
door
to
after
me
the
carriage
went
on
to
my
intense
relief
it
rounded
the
corner
i
was
undiscovered
but
at
that
moment
it
came
to
a
sudden
stop
an
invisible
hand
opened
the
door
and
grasping
my
collar
gently
but
firmly
propelled
me
into
the
street
and
dropped
me
there
then
the
carriage
went
on
not
a
word
had
been
spoken
they
understood
and
so
did
i
it
was
enough
illustration
the
carriage
went
on
but
as
i
said
i
had
my
revenge
it
came
when
the
opposition
reporters
believing
the
mystery
to
be
near
its
solution
footnote
this
was
as
nearly
as
i
remember
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
following
the
robbery
entered
into
a
conspiracy
to
forestall
it
and
deliberately
invented
the
lines
of
the
coming
denouement
day
by
day
they
published
its
progress
upon
the
authority
of
a
high
official
who
never
existed
announcing
that
behind
each
one
of
the
stood
a
detective
with
uplifted
hand
ready
to
arrest
him
when
the
word
was
given
it
was
truly
the
dawn
of
yellow
journalism
with
such
extraordinary
circumstantiality
were
the
accounts
given
that
for
once
my
office
wavered
in
its
faith
in
ensign
and
me
amos
ensign
was
my
partner
at
the
time
a
fine
fellow
and
a
good
reporter
if
we
turned
out
to
be
wrong
we
were
given
to
understand
our
careers
on
the
would
be
at
an
end
i
slept
little
or
none
during
that
month
of
intense
work
and
excitement
but
spent
my
days
as
my
nights
sifting
every
scrap
of
evidence
there
was
nothing
to
justify
the
stories
and
we
maintained
in
our
paper
that
they
were
lies
shanks
himself
left
the
city
desk
and
came
up
to
work
with
us
his
head
too
would
fall
we
heard
if
his
faith
in
the
police
office
had
been
misplaced
the
bubble
burst
at
last
and
as
we
expected
there
was
nothing
in
it
the
was
justified
the
opposition
reporters
were
fined
or
suspended
ensign
and
i
were
made
much
of
in
the
office
i
have
still
the
bulletin
in
which
shanks
spoke
of
me
as
the
man
whose
work
had
done
much
to
make
the
police
reports
the
best
in
the
city
sweet
comfort
for
the
dutchman
my
salary
was
raised
but
that
was
of
less
account
we
had
saved
the
day
and
the
desk
after
that
it
was
not
all
pulling
in
mulberry
street
nothing
in
this
world
succeeds
like
success
illustration
the
bulletin
before
that
i
had
been
once
suspended
myself
for
missing
something
in
this
very
case
i
was
not
to
blame
and
therefore
was
angry
and
refused
to
make
explanations
that
night
as
i
sat
sulking
in
my
home
in
brooklyn
a
big
warehouse
fire
broke
out
down
town
from
our
house
on
the
hill
i
watched
it
grow
beyond
control
and
knew
that
the
boys
were
hard
put
to
it
it
was
late
and
as
i
thought
of
the
hastening
hours
the
police
reporter
got
the
better
of
the
man
and
i
hurried
down
to
take
a
hand
when
i
turned
up
in
the
office
after
midnight
to
write
the
story
the
night
editor
eyed
me
curiously
i
thought
riis
you
were
suspended
he
said
for
a
moment
i
wavered
smarting
under
the
injustice
of
it
all
but
my
reminded
me
i
am
i
said
and
when
i
am
done
with
this
i
am
going
home
till
you
send
for
me
but
this
fire
can
i
have
a
desk
the
night
editor
got
up
and
came
over
and
shook
hands
take
mine
he
said
there
take
it
they
sent
for
me
the
next
day
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
all
this
was
smooth
sailing
along
with
the
occasional
commendations
for
battles
won
against
the
mob
went
constant
and
grievous
complaints
of
the
editors
supplied
by
the
associated
press
and
even
by
some
in
my
own
office
now
and
then
of
my
style
it
was
very
bad
according
to
my
critics
altogether
editorial
and
presuming
and
not
to
be
borne
so
i
was
warned
that
i
must
mend
it
and
give
the
facts
sparing
comments
by
that
i
suppose
they
meant
that
i
must
write
not
what
i
thought
but
what
they
probably
might
think
of
the
news
but
good
or
bad
i
could
write
in
no
other
way
and
kept
right
on
not
that
i
think
by
any
manners
of
means
that
it
was
the
best
way
but
it
was
mine
and
goodness
knows
i
had
no
desire
to
be
an
editor
i
have
not
now
i
prefer
to
be
a
reporter
and
deal
with
the
facts
to
being
an
editor
and
lying
about
them
in
the
end
the
complaints
died
out
i
suppose
i
was
given
up
as
hopeless
perhaps
there
had
crept
into
my
reports
too
much
of
my
fight
with
the
police
for
by
that
time
i
had
included
them
in
the
opposition
they
had
not
been
friendly
from
the
first
and
it
was
best
so
i
had
them
all
in
front
then
and
an
open
enemy
is
better
any
day
than
a
false
friend
who
may
stab
you
in
the
back
in
the
quarter
of
a
century
since
i
have
seldom
been
on
any
other
terms
with
the
police
i
mean
with
the
heads
of
them
the
rank
and
file
the
man
with
the
nightstick
as
roosevelt
liked
to
call
him
is
all
right
if
properly
led
he
has
rarely
been
properly
led
it
may
be
that
in
that
respect
at
least
my
reports
might
have
been
tempered
somewhat
to
advantage
though
i
do
know
i
prefer
after
all
to
have
it
out
all
out
and
it
did
come
out
and
my
mind
was
relieved
which
was
something
illustration
the
general
said
never
a
word
speaking
of
reminds
me
of
seeing
general
grant
in
his
to
my
mind
greatest
hour
the
only
time
he
was
ever
beaten
and
by
a
policeman
i
told
his
son
fred
grant
of
it
when
he
became
a
police
commissioner
in
the
nineties
but
i
do
not
think
he
appreciated
it
he
was
not
cast
in
his
great
father
mould
the
occasion
i
refer
to
was
after
the
general
second
term
in
the
presidency
he
was
staying
at
the
fifth
avenue
hotel
when
one
morning
the
masonic
temple
was
burned
the
was
drawn
halfway
down
the
block
toward
fifth
avenue
but
the
police
were
much
hampered
by
the
crowd
and
were
out
of
patience
when
i
standing
by
saw
a
man
in
a
great
ulster
with
head
buried
deep
in
the
collar
a
cigar
sticking
straight
out
coming
down
the
street
from
the
hotel
i
recognized
him
at
sight
as
general
grant
the
policeman
who
blocked
his
way
did
not
he
grabbed
him
by
the
collar
swung
him
about
and
hitting
him
a
resounding
whack
across
the
back
with
his
club
yelled
out
what
the
matter
with
you
do
you
see
the
chase
yourself
out
of
here
and
be
quick
about
it
the
general
said
never
a
word
he
did
not
stop
to
argue
the
matter
he
had
run
up
against
a
sentinel
and
when
stopped
went
the
other
way
that
was
all
the
man
had
a
right
to
be
there
he
had
none
i
was
never
so
much
an
admirer
of
grant
as
since
that
day
it
was
true
greatness
a
smaller
man
would
have
made
a
row
stood
upon
his
dignity
and
demanded
the
punishment
of
the
policeman
as
for
him
there
was
probably
never
so
badly
frightened
a
policeman
when
i
told
him
whom
he
had
clubbed
i
will
warrant
he
did
not
sleep
for
a
week
fearing
all
kinds
of
things
no
need
of
it
grant
probably
never
gave
him
a
thought
it
was
in
pursuit
of
the
story
of
a
breton
nobleman
of
ancient
lineage
that
i
met
with
the
most
disheartening
of
my
experience
the
setting
of
the
case
was
most
alluring
the
old
baron
for
he
was
nothing
less
though
in
minetta
lane
he
passed
for
a
man
who
peddled
his
odd
ware
from
door
to
door
had
been
found
by
the
police
sick
and
starving
in
his
wretched
cellar
and
had
been
taken
to
bellevue
hospital
the
inevitable
suggested
the
story
and
papers
that
i
found
in
his
trunk
papers
most
carefully
guarded
and
cherished
told
enough
of
it
to
whet
my
appetite
to
its
keenest
edge
if
the
owner
could
only
be
made
to
talk
if
his
stubborn
family
pride
could
only
be
overcome
there
was
every
promise
here
of
a
sensation
by
means
of
which
who
could
tell
but
belated
justice
might
even
be
done
him
and
his
family
apart
from
the
phenomenal
trouncing
i
should
be
administering
through
him
to
my
rivals
visions
of
conspiracies
court
intrigues
confiscations
and
what
not
danced
before
my
greedy
mental
vision
i
flew
rather
than
walked
up
to
bellevue
hospital
to
offer
him
my
paper
and
pen
in
the
service
of
right
and
of
vengeance
only
to
find
that
i
was
hours
late
the
patient
had
already
been
transferred
to
the
charity
hospital
as
a
bad
case
the
boat
had
gone
there
would
not
be
another
for
several
hours
i
could
not
wait
but
it
was
a
comfort
at
all
events
to
know
that
my
baron
was
where
i
could
get
at
him
on
the
morrow
i
dreamed
some
more
dreams
of
happiness
as
i
went
back
and
was
content
as
it
happened
i
was
very
busy
the
next
day
and
for
several
days
after
the
week
was
nearly
spent
when
i
found
myself
on
the
boat
going
up
to
the
island
at
the
hospital
office
they
reassured
me
with
a
queer
look
yes
my
man
was
there
likely
to
stay
there
for
a
little
while
the
doctor
would
presently
take
me
to
see
him
on
his
rounds
in
one
of
the
big
wards
i
found
him
at
last
numbered
in
the
row
of
beds
among
a
score
of
other
human
wrecks
a
little
old
man
bent
and
haggard
but
with
some
of
the
dignity
i
fancied
of
his
noble
descent
upon
his
white
and
wrinkled
brow
he
sat
up
in
bed
propped
by
pillows
and
listened
with
hungry
eyes
as
in
french
which
i
had
most
carefully
polished
up
for
the
occasion
i
told
him
my
errand
when
at
last
i
paused
waiting
anxiously
for
an
answer
he
laid
one
trembling
hand
on
mine
i
noticed
that
the
other
hung
limp
from
the
shoulder
and
made
as
it
seemed
a
superhuman
effort
to
speak
but
only
inarticulate
pitiful
sounds
came
forth
i
looked
appealingly
at
the
doctor
dumb
he
said
and
shook
his
head
paralysis
involving
the
vocal
organs
he
will
never
speak
again
and
he
did
he
was
buried
in
the
potter
field
the
next
week
for
once
i
was
too
late
the
story
of
the
last
of
my
barons
remains
untold
until
this
hour
and
now
that
this
chapter
somewhat
against
my
planning
has
become
wholly
the
police
reporter
i
shall
have
to
bring
up
my
though
that
came
a
long
while
after
my
getting
into
mulberry
street
i
shall
not
have
so
good
an
opportunity
again
it
was
the
occasion
of
the
last
of
my
many
battles
for
the
mastery
but
more
than
that
it
illustrates
very
well
that
which
i
have
been
trying
to
describe
as
a
reporter
public
function
we
had
been
for
months
in
dread
of
a
cholera
scourge
that
summer
when
mousing
about
the
health
department
one
day
i
picked
up
the
weekly
analysis
of
the
croton
water
and
noticed
that
there
had
been
for
two
weeks
past
a
trace
of
nitrites
in
the
water
i
asked
the
department
chemist
what
it
was
he
gave
an
evasive
answer
and
my
curiosity
was
at
once
aroused
there
must
be
no
unknown
or
doubtful
ingredient
in
the
water
supply
of
a
city
of
two
million
souls
like
caesar
wife
it
must
be
above
suspicion
within
an
hour
i
had
learned
that
the
nitrites
meant
in
fact
that
there
had
been
at
one
time
sewage
contamination
consequently
that
we
were
face
to
face
with
a
most
grave
problem
how
had
the
water
become
polluted
and
who
guaranteed
that
it
was
not
in
that
way
even
then
with
the
black
death
threatening
to
cross
the
ocean
from
europe
i
sounded
the
warning
in
my
paper
then
the
counselled
the
people
to
boil
the
water
pending
further
discoveries
then
took
my
camera
and
went
up
in
the
watershed
i
spent
a
week
there
following
to
its
source
every
stream
that
discharged
into
the
croton
river
and
photographing
my
evidence
wherever
i
found
it
when
i
told
my
story
in
print
illustrated
with
the
pictures
the
town
was
astounded
the
board
of
health
sent
inspectors
to
the
watershed
who
reported
that
things
were
worse
a
great
deal
than
i
had
said
populous
towns
sewered
directly
into
our
there
was
not
even
a
pretence
at
decency
the
people
bathed
and
washed
their
dogs
in
the
streams
the
public
town
dumps
were
on
their
banks
the
rival
newspapers
tried
to
belittle
the
evil
because
their
reporters
were
beaten
running
water
purifies
itself
they
said
so
it
does
if
it
runs
far
enough
and
long
enough
i
put
that
matter
to
the
test
taking
the
case
of
a
town
some
sixty
miles
out
of
new
york
one
of
the
worst
offenders
i
ascertained
from
the
engineer
of
the
how
long
it
ordinarily
took
to
bring
water
from
the
sodom
reservoir
just
beyond
down
to
the
faucets
in
the
city
four
days
i
think
it
was
then
i
went
to
the
doctors
and
asked
them
how
many
days
a
vigorous
cholera
bacillus
might
live
and
multiply
in
running
water
about
seven
said
they
my
case
was
made
there
was
needed
but
a
single
case
of
the
dreaded
scourge
in
any
one
of
a
dozen
towns
or
villages
that
were
on
the
line
of
travel
from
the
harbor
in
which
a
half
score
ships
were
under
quarantine
to
put
the
metropolis
at
the
mercy
of
an
inconceivable
calamity
there
was
in
all
this
no
attempt
at
sensation
it
was
simple
fact
as
any
one
could
see
for
himself
the
health
inspectors
report
clinched
the
matter
the
newspapers
editorially
abandoned
their
reporters
to
ridicule
and
their
fate
the
city
had
to
purchase
a
strip
of
land
along
the
streams
wide
enough
to
guard
against
direct
pollution
it
cost
millions
of
dollars
but
it
was
the
merest
trifle
to
what
a
cholera
epidemic
would
have
meant
to
new
york
in
loss
of
commercial
prestige
let
alone
human
lives
the
contention
over
that
end
of
it
was
transferred
to
albany
where
the
politicians
took
a
hand
what
is
there
they
do
not
exploit
years
after
meeting
one
of
them
who
knew
my
share
in
it
he
asked
me
with
a
wink
and
a
confidential
shove
how
much
i
got
out
of
it
when
i
told
him
nothing
i
knew
that
upon
my
own
statement
he
took
me
for
either
a
liar
or
a
fool
the
last
being
considerably
the
worse
of
the
two
alternatives
in
all
of
this
battlesome
account
i
have
said
nothing
about
the
biggest
fight
of
all
i
had
that
with
myself
in
the
years
that
had
passed
i
had
never
forgotten
the
sergeant
in
the
church
street
police
station
and
my
dog
it
is
the
kind
of
thing
you
do
not
get
over
way
back
in
my
mind
there
was
the
secret
thought
the
day
i
went
up
to
mulberry
street
that
my
time
was
coming
at
last
and
now
it
had
come
i
had
a
recognized
place
at
headquarters
and
place
in
the
police
world
means
power
more
or
less
the
backing
of
the
had
given
me
influence
more
i
had
conquered
myself
in
my
fights
with
the
police
enough
for
revenge
at
the
thought
i
flushed
with
anger
it
has
power
yet
to
make
my
blood
boil
the
thought
of
that
night
in
the
it
was
then
my
great
temptation
came
no
doubt
the
sergeant
was
still
there
if
not
i
could
find
him
i
knew
the
day
and
hour
when
it
happened
they
were
burned
into
my
brain
i
had
only
to
turn
to
the
department
records
to
find
out
who
made
out
the
returns
on
that
october
morning
while
i
was
walking
the
weary
length
of
the
bridge
across
raritan
bay
to
have
him
within
reach
there
were
a
hundred
ways
in
which
i
could
hound
him
then
out
of
place
and
pay
even
as
he
had
driven
me
forth
from
the
last
poor
shelter
and
caused
my
only
friend
to
be
killed
speak
not
to
me
of
the
sweetness
of
revenge
of
all
unhappy
mortals
the
vengeful
man
must
be
the
most
wretched
i
suffered
more
in
the
anticipation
of
mine
than
ever
i
had
when
smarting
under
the
injury
grievous
as
the
memory
of
it
is
to
me
even
now
day
after
day
i
went
across
the
street
to
begin
the
search
for
hours
i
lingered
about
the
record
clerk
room
where
they
kept
the
old
blotters
unable
to
tear
myself
away
once
i
even
had
the
one
from
church
street
of
october
in
my
hands
but
i
did
not
open
it
even
as
i
held
it
i
saw
another
and
a
better
way
i
would
kill
the
abuse
not
the
man
who
was
but
the
instrument
and
the
victim
of
it
for
never
was
parody
upon
christian
charity
more
corrupting
to
human
mind
and
soul
than
the
frightful
abomination
of
the
police
sole
provision
made
by
the
municipality
for
its
homeless
wanderers
within
a
year
i
have
seen
the
process
in
full
operation
in
chicago
have
heard
a
sergeant
in
the
harrison
street
station
there
tell
me
when
my
indignation
found
vent
in
angry
words
that
they
cared
less
for
those
men
and
women
than
for
the
cur
dogs
in
the
street
exactly
so
my
sergeant
was
of
the
same
stamp
those
dens
daily
association
with
them
had
stamped
him
then
and
there
i
resolved
to
wipe
them
out
bodily
if
god
gave
me
health
and
strength
and
i
put
the
book
away
quick
and
never
saw
it
again
i
do
not
know
till
this
day
who
the
sergeant
was
and
i
am
glad
i
do
not
it
is
better
so
of
what
i
did
to
carry
out
my
purpose
and
how
it
was
done
i
must
tell
hereafter
it
was
the
source
and
beginning
of
all
the
work
which
justifies
the
writing
of
these
pages
and
among
all
the
things
which
i
have
been
credited
with
doing
since
it
is
one
of
the
few
in
which
i
really
bore
a
strong
hand
and
yet
it
was
not
mine
which
finally
wrought
that
great
work
but
a
stronger
and
better
than
mine
theodore
roosevelt
even
while
i
was
writing
this
account
we
together
drove
in
the
last
nail
in
the
coffin
of
the
bad
old
days
by
persuading
the
charter
revision
commission
to
remove
from
the
organic
law
of
the
city
the
clause
giving
to
the
police
the
care
of
vagrants
which
was
the
cause
of
it
all
it
had
remained
over
in
the
charter
of
the
greater
new
york
in
spite
of
our
protests
it
was
never
the
proper
business
of
the
police
to
dispense
charity
they
have
their
hands
full
with
repressing
crime
it
is
the
mixing
of
the
two
that
confuses
standards
and
makes
trouble
without
end
for
those
who
receive
the
charity
and
even
more
for
those
who
dispense
it
you
can
not
pervert
the
first
and
finest
of
human
instincts
without
corrupting
men
witness
my
sergeant
in

chapter

my
dog
is
avenged
the
lilacs
blossom
under
my
window
as
i
begin
this
chapter
and
the
bees
are
humming
among
them
the
sweet
smell
of
wild
cherry
comes
up
from
the
garden
where
the
sunlight
lies
upon
the
young
grass
robin
and
oriole
call
to
their
mates
in
the
trees
there
upon
the
lawn
is
elisabeth
tending
some
linen
laid
out
to
dry
her
form
is
as
lithe
and
her
step
as
light
as
in
the
days
i
have
written
about
grandmother
as
she
is
i
can
see
though
her
back
is
turned
the
look
of
affectionate
pride
with
which
she
surveys
our
home
for
i
know
well
enough
what
she
is
thinking
of
and
so
it
has
been
a
blessed
good
home
how
could
it
help
being
that
with
her
in
it
they
say
it
is
a
sign
one
is
growing
old
when
one
thoughts
dwell
much
on
the
past
perhaps
with
me
it
is
only
a
sign
that
the
printers
are
on
the
often
when
i
hear
her
sing
with
the
children
my
mind
wanders
back
to
the
long
winter
evenings
in
those
early
years
when
she
sat
listening
late
for
my
step
she
sang
then
to
keep
up
her
courage
my
work
in
mulberry
street
was
at
night
and
she
was
much
alone
even
as
i
was
fighting
my
battles
there
she
had
it
out
with
the
homesickness
then
and
i
think
hers
was
a
good
deal
the
harder
fight
i
had
the
enemy
all
in
front
where
i
could
see
to
whack
him
but
so
we
found
ourselves
and
each
other
and
it
was
worth
all
it
cost
except
in
the
short
winter
days
it
was
always
broad
daylight
when
i
came
home
from
work
my
route
from
the
office
lay
through
the
fourth
and
the
sixth
wards
the
worst
in
the
city
and
for
years
i
walked
every
morning
between
two
and
four
the
whole
length
of
mulberry
street
through
the
bend
and
across
the
five
points
down
to
fulton
ferry
there
were
cars
on
the
bowery
but
i
liked
to
walk
for
so
i
saw
the
slum
when
off
its
guard
the
instinct
to
pose
is
as
strong
there
as
it
is
on
fifth
avenue
it
is
a
human
impulse
i
suppose
we
all
like
to
be
thought
well
of
by
our
fellows
but
at
the
veneering
is
off
and
you
see
the
true
grain
of
a
thing
so
also
i
got
a
picture
of
the
bend
upon
my
mind
which
so
soon
as
i
should
be
able
to
transfer
it
to
that
of
the
community
would
help
settle
with
that
according
to
its
deserts
it
was
not
fit
for
christian
men
and
women
let
alone
innocent
children
to
live
in
and
therefore
it
had
to
go
so
with
the
police
some
of
the
worst
of
which
were
right
there
at
the
mulberry
street
station
and
around
the
corner
in
elizabeth
street
the
way
of
it
never
gave
me
any
concern
that
i
remember
that
would
open
as
soon
as
the
truth
was
told
the
trouble
was
that
people
did
not
know
and
had
no
means
of
finding
out
for
themselves
but
i
had
accordingly
i
went
poking
about
among
the
foul
alleys
and
fouler
tenements
of
the
bend
when
they
slept
in
their
filth
sometimes
with
the
policeman
on
the
beat
more
often
alone
sounding
the
misery
and
the
depravity
of
it
to
their
depth
i
think
a
notion
of
the
purpose
of
it
all
crept
into
the
office
even
while
i
was
only
half
aware
of
it
myself
for
when
after
a
year
service
at
the
police
office
i
was
taken
with
a
longing
for
the
open
as
it
were
and
went
to
the
city
editor
who
had
succeeded
shanks
with
the
request
that
i
be
transferred
to
general
work
he
refused
flatly
i
had
made
a
good
record
as
a
police
reporter
but
it
was
not
that
go
back
and
stay
he
said
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
you
are
finding
something
up
there
that
needs
you
wait
and
see
and
so
for
the
second
time
i
was
turned
back
to
the
task
i
wanted
to
shirk
jonah
was
one
of
us
sure
enough
those
who
see
only
the
whale
fail
to
catch
the
point
in
the
most
human
story
ever
told
a
point
i
am
afraid
that
has
a
special
application
to
most
of
us
i
have
often
been
asked
if
such
slumming
is
not
full
of
peril
no
not
if
you
are
there
on
business
mere
sightseeing
at
such
unseasonable
hours
might
easily
be
but
the
man
who
is
sober
and
minds
his
own
business
which
presupposes
that
he
has
business
to
mind
there
runs
no
risk
anywhere
in
new
york
by
night
or
by
day
such
a
man
will
take
the
other
side
of
the
street
when
he
sees
a
gang
ahead
spoiling
for
a
fight
and
where
he
does
go
he
will
carry
the
quiet
assumption
of
authority
that
comes
with
the
consciousness
of
a
right
to
be
where
he
is
that
usually
settles
it
there
was
perhaps
another
factor
in
my
case
that
helped
whether
it
was
my
slouch
hat
and
my
spectacles
or
the
fact
that
i
had
been
often
called
into
requisition
to
help
an
ambulance
surgeon
patch
up
an
injured
man
the
nickname
doc
had
somehow
stuck
to
me
and
i
was
supposed
by
many
to
be
a
physician
connected
with
the
health
department
doctors
are
never
molested
in
the
slum
it
does
not
know
but
that
its
turn
to
need
them
is
coming
next
no
more
was
i
can
think
of
only
two
occasions
in
more
than
twenty
years
of
police
reporting
when
i
was
in
actual
peril
though
once
i
was
very
badly
frightened
one
was
when
a
cry
of
murder
had
lured
me
down
crosby
street
into
a
saloon
on
the
corner
of
jersey
street
where
the
gang
of
the
neighborhood
had
just
stabbed
the
in
a
drunken
brawl
he
was
lying
in
a
chair
surrounded
by
shrieking
women
when
i
ran
in
on
the
instant
the
doors
were
slammed
and
barred
behind
me
and
i
found
myself
on
the
battlefield
with
the
battle
raging
unabated
bottles
were
flying
thick
and
fast
and
the
bar
was
going
to
smash
as
i
bent
over
the
wounded
man
i
saw
that
he
was
done
for
the
knife
was
even
then
sticking
in
his
neck
its
point
driven
into
the
backbone
the
instinct
of
the
reporter
came
uppermost
and
as
i
pulled
it
out
and
held
it
up
in
a
pause
of
the
fray
i
asked
incautiously
whose
knife
is
this
a
that
shaved
within
an
inch
of
my
head
followed
by
an
angry
oath
at
once
recalled
me
to
myself
and
showed
me
my
role
you
tend
to
your
business
you
infernal
and
let
us
run
ours
ran
the
message
and
i
understood
i
called
for
bandages
a
sponge
and
a
basin
and
acted
the
surgeon
as
well
as
i
could
trying
to
stanch
the
flow
of
blood
while
the
racket
rose
and
the
women
shrieked
louder
with
each
passing
moment
through
the
turmoil
i
strained
every
nerve
to
catch
the
sound
of
policemen
tramp
it
was
hardly
three
minutes
run
to
the
but
time
never
dragged
as
it
did
then
once
i
thought
relief
had
come
but
as
i
listened
and
caught
the
wail
of
men
being
beaten
in
the
street
i
smiled
wickedly
in
the
midst
of
my
own
troubles
for
the
voices
told
me
that
my
opponents
from
headquarters
following
on
my
track
had
fallen
among
thieves
half
the
gang
were
then
outside
at
last
just
as
an
empty
keg
knocked
my
patient
from
his
chair
the
doors
fell
in
with
a
crash
the
reserves
had
come
their
clubs
soon
cleared
the
air
and
relieved
me
of
my
involuntary
task
with
my
patient
yet
alive
another
time
turning
a
corner
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
i
came
suddenly
upon
a
gang
of
drunken
roughs
ripe
for
mischief
the
leader
had
a
long
with
which
he
playfully
jabbed
me
in
the
ribs
insolently
demanding
what
i
thought
of
it
i
seized
him
by
the
wrist
with
as
calm
a
pretence
of
considering
the
knife
as
i
could
summon
up
but
really
to
prevent
his
cutting
me
i
felt
the
point
pricking
through
my
clothes
about
two
inches
longer
than
the
law
allows
i
said
sparring
for
time
i
think
i
will
take
that
i
knew
even
as
i
said
it
that
i
had
cast
the
die
he
held
my
life
in
his
hand
it
was
a
simple
question
of
which
was
the
stronger
and
it
was
already
decided
despite
my
utmost
effort
to
stay
it
the
point
of
the
knife
was
piercing
my
skin
the
gang
stood
by
watching
the
silent
struggle
i
knew
them
the
the
worst
cutthroats
in
the
city
charged
with
a
dozen
murders
and
robberies
without
end
a
human
life
was
to
them
in
the
mood
they
were
in
worth
as
much
as
the
dirt
under
their
feet
no
more
at
that
instant
not
six
feet
behind
their
backs
captain
mccullagh
the
same
who
afterward
became
chief
turned
the
corner
with
his
precinct
detective
i
gathered
all
my
strength
and
gave
the
ruffian
hand
a
mighty
twist
that
turned
the
knife
aside
i
held
it
out
for
inspection
what
do
you
think
of
it
cap
four
brawny
fists
scattered
the
gang
to
the
winds
for
an
answer
the
knife
was
left
in
my
hand
they
gave
me
no
time
to
get
frightened
once
when
i
really
was
scared
it
was
entirely
my
own
doing
and
furthermore
it
served
me
right
it
was
on
a
very
hot
july
morning
that
coming
down
mulberry
street
i
saw
a
big
gray
cat
sitting
on
a
outside
a
corner
saloon
it
was
fast
asleep
and
snored
so
loudly
that
it
aroused
my
anger
it
is
bad
enough
to
have
a
man
snore
but
a
cat
it
was
not
to
be
borne
i
hauled
off
with
my
cane
and
gave
the
beast
a
most
cruel
and
undeserved
blow
to
teach
it
better
manners
the
snoring
was
smothered
in
a
yell
the
cat
came
down
from
the
keg
and
to
my
horror
there
rose
from
behind
the
corner
an
angry
celt
swearing
a
blue
streak
he
seemed
to
my
anguished
gaze
at
least
nine
feet
tall
he
had
been
asleep
at
his
own
door
when
my
blow
aroused
him
and
it
was
his
stocking
feet
propped
up
on
the
keg
as
he
dozed
in
his
chair
around
the
corner
i
had
mistaken
for
a
gray
cat
it
was
not
a
time
for
explanations
i
did
the
only
thing
there
was
to
be
done
i
ran
far
and
fast
did
i
run
it
was
my
good
luck
that
his
smarting
feet
kept
him
from
following
or
i
might
not
have
lived
to
tell
this
tale
as
i
said
it
served
me
right
perhaps
it
is
in
the
way
of
reparation
that
i
now
support
twelve
cats
upon
my
premises
three
of
them
are
clawing
at
my
study
door
this
minute
demanding
to
be
let
in
but
i
can
not
even
claim
the
poor
merit
of
providing
for
them
it
is
my
daughter
who
runs
the
cats
i
merely
growl
at
and
feed
them
the
mention
of
bowery
night
cars
brings
to
my
mind
an
episode
of
that
time
which
was
thoroughly
characteristic
of
the
highway
that
never
sleeps
i
was
on
the
way
down
town
in
one
with
a
single
who
was
asleep
just
inside
the
door
his
head
nodding
with
every
jolt
as
though
it
were
in
danger
of
coming
off
at
grand
street
a
german
boarded
the
car
and
proffered
a
bad
in
payment
of
his
fare
the
conductor
bit
it
and
gave
it
back
with
a
grunt
of
contempt
the
german
fell
into
a
state
of
excitement
at
once
vat
he
shouted
it
vas
pad
and
slapped
the
coin
down
on
the
wooden
seat
with
all
his
might
that
we
might
hear
the
ring
it
rebounded
with
a
long
slant
and
fell
into
the
lap
of
the
sleeping
passenger
who
instantly
woke
up
grabbed
the
and
vanished
through
the
door
and
into
the
darkness
without
as
much
as
looking
around
followed
by
the
desolate
howl
of
the
despoiled
german
himmel
one
united
shdades
clean
gone
the
time
came
at
length
when
i
exchanged
night
work
for
day
work
and
i
was
not
sorry
a
new
life
began
for
me
with
greatly
enlarged
opportunities
i
had
been
absorbing
impressions
up
till
then
i
met
men
now
in
whose
companionship
they
began
to
crystallize
to
form
into
definite
convictions
men
of
learning
of
sympathy
and
of
power
my
eggs
hatched
from
that
time
dates
my
friendship
priceless
to
me
with
roger
tracy
then
a
sanitary
inspector
in
the
health
department
later
its
distinguished
statistician
to
whom
i
owe
pretty
much
all
the
understanding
i
have
ever
had
of
the
problems
i
have
battled
with
for
he
is
very
wise
while
i
am
rather
dull
of
wit
but
directly
i
get
talking
things
over
with
him
i
brighten
right
up
i
met
professor
charles
chandler
major
willard
bullard
edward
janes
men
to
whose
practical
wisdom
and
patient
labors
in
the
shaping
of
the
health
work
the
metropolis
owes
a
greater
debt
than
it
is
aware
of
john
nagle
whose
friendly
camera
later
on
gave
me
some
invaluable
lessons
and
general
ely
parker
chief
of
the
six
nations
illustration
roger
s
tracy
i
suppose
it
was
the
fact
that
he
was
an
indian
that
first
attracted
me
to
him
as
the
years
passed
we
became
great
friends
and
i
loved
nothing
better
in
an
idle
hour
than
to
smoke
a
pipe
with
the
general
in
his
poky
little
office
at
police
headquarters
that
was
about
all
there
was
to
it
too
for
he
rarely
opened
his
mouth
except
to
grunt
approval
of
something
i
was
saying
when
once
in
a
while
it
would
happen
that
some
of
his
people
came
down
from
the
reservation
or
from
canada
the
powwow
that
ensued
was
my
dear
delight
three
pipes
and
about
eleven
grunts
made
up
the
whole
of
it
but
it
was
none
the
less
entirely
friendly
and
satisfactory
we
all
have
our
own
ways
of
doing
things
and
that
was
theirs
he
was
a
noble
old
fellow
his
title
was
no
trumpery
show
either
it
was
fairly
earned
on
more
than
one
bloody
field
with
grant
army
parker
was
grant
military
secretary
and
wrote
the
original
draft
of
the
surrender
at
appomattox
which
he
kept
to
his
death
with
great
pride
it
was
not
general
parker
however
but
donehogawa
chief
of
the
senecas
and
of
the
remnant
of
the
once
powerful
six
nations
and
guardian
of
the
western
door
of
the
council
lodge
that
appealed
to
me
who
in
my
boyhood
had
lived
with
and
with
uncas
and
chingachgook
they
had
something
to
do
with
my
coming
here
and
at
last
i
had
for
a
friend
one
of
their
kin
i
think
he
felt
the
bond
of
sympathy
between
us
and
prized
it
for
he
showed
me
in
many
silent
ways
that
he
was
fond
of
me
there
was
about
him
an
infinite
pathos
penned
up
there
in
his
old
age
among
the
tenements
of
mulberry
street
on
the
pay
of
a
clerk
that
never
ceased
to
appeal
to
me
when
he
lay
dead
stricken
like
the
soldier
he
was
at
his
post
some
letters
of
his
to
harriet
converse
the
adopted
child
of
his
tribe
went
to
my
heart
they
were
addressed
to
her
on
her
travels
he
was
of
the
wolf
tribe
she
a
snipe
from
the
wolf
to
the
wandering
snipe
they
ran
even
in
mulberry
street
he
was
a
true
son
of
the
forest
perhaps
the
general
sympathies
went
out
to
me
as
a
fighter
the
change
of
front
from
night
to
day
brought
no
on
hostilities
in
our
camp
rather
the
reverse
for
this
there
was
good
cause
i
had
interfered
with
privileges
i
found
the
day
men
coming
to
work
at
all
hours
from
ten
to
twelve
or
even
one
i
went
on
duty
at
eight
and
the
immediate
result
was
to
compel
all
the
others
to
do
the
same
this
was
a
sore
grievance
and
was
held
against
me
for
a
long
time
the
logical
outcome
of
the
war
it
provoked
was
to
stretch
the
day
farther
into
the
small
hours
before
i
left
mulberry
street
the
circuit
had
been
made
the
watch
now
is
kept
up
through
the
hours
without
interruption
like
its
neighbor
the
bowery
mulberry
street
never
sleeps
illustration
general
ely
parker
chief
of
the
six
nations
there
had
been
in
an
awakening
of
the
public
conscience
on
the
question
which
i
had
followed
with
interest
because
it
had
started
in
the
churches
that
have
always
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
right
forum
for
such
a
discussion
on
every
ground
and
most
for
their
own
sake
and
the
cause
they
stand
for
but
the
awakening
proved
more
of
a
sleepy
yawn
than
real
like
a
man
stretching
himself
in
bed
with
half
a
mind
to
get
up
five
years
later
in
came
the
commission
which
first
brought
home
to
us
the
fact
that
the
people
living
in
the
tenements
were
better
than
the
houses
that
was
a
big
white
milestone
on
a
dreary
road
from
that
time
on
we
hear
of
souls
in
the
slum
the
property
end
of
it
had
held
the
stage
up
till
then
and
in
a
kind
of
i
suppose
we
had
had
to
forget
that
the
people
there
had
souls
because
you
could
very
well
count
souls
as
chattels
yielding
so
much
income
to
the
owner
it
would
not
be
polite
toward
the
lord
say
sounds
queer
but
if
that
was
not
the
attitude
i
would
like
to
know
what
it
was
the
commission
met
at
police
headquarters
and
i
sat
through
all
its
sessions
as
a
reporter
and
heard
every
word
of
the
testimony
which
was
more
than
some
of
the
commissioners
did
ottendorfer
and
drexel
the
banker
took
many
a
quiet
little
nap
when
things
were
dull
one
man
the
landlords
who
had
their
innings
to
the
full
never
caught
off
his
guard
his
clear
incisive
questions
that
went
through
all
subterfuges
to
the
root
of
things
were
sometimes
like
flashes
of
lightning
on
a
dark
night
discovering
the
landscape
far
and
near
he
was
felix
adler
whom
i
met
there
for
the
first
time
the
passing
years
have
given
him
a
very
warm
place
in
my
heart
adler
was
born
a
jew
often
when
i
think
of
the
position
the
christian
church
took
or
rather
did
not
take
on
a
matter
so
nearly
concerning
it
as
the
murder
of
the
home
in
a
tenement
population
of
a
million
souls
for
that
was
what
it
came
to
i
am
reminded
of
a
talk
we
had
once
in
adler
study
i
was
going
to
boston
to
speak
to
a
body
of
clergymen
at
their
monthly
dinner
meeting
he
had
shortly
before
received
an
invitation
to
address
the
same
body
on
the
personality
of
christ
but
had
it
in
his
mind
not
to
go
what
will
you
tell
them
i
asked
the
doctor
smiled
a
thoughtful
little
smile
as
he
said
i
shall
tell
them
that
the
personality
of
christ
is
too
sacred
a
subject
for
me
to
discuss
at
an
meeting
in
a
swell
hotel
does
that
help
you
to
understand
that
among
the
strongest
of
moral
forces
in
christian
new
york
was
and
is
adler
the
jew
or
heretic
take
it
whichever
way
you
please
four
years
later
the
finishing
touch
was
put
to
the
course
i
took
with
the
adler
commission
when
toward
the
end
of
a
three
days
session
in
chickering
hall
of
ministers
of
every
sect
who
were
concerned
about
the
losing
fight
the
church
was
waging
among
the
masses
a
man
stood
in
the
meeting
and
cried
out
how
are
these
men
and
women
to
understand
the
love
of
god
you
speak
of
when
they
see
only
the
greed
of
men
he
was
a
builder
alfred
white
of
brooklyn
who
had
proved
the
faith
that
was
in
him
by
building
real
homes
for
the
people
and
had
proved
too
that
they
were
a
paying
investment
it
was
just
a
question
whether
a
man
would
take
seven
per
cent
and
save
his
soul
or
and
lose
it
and
i
might
as
well
add
here
that
it
is
the
same
story
yet
all
our
hopes
for
betterment
all
our
battling
with
the
question
sum
themselves
up
in
the
effort
since
there
are
men
yet
who
would
take
per
cent
and
run
that
risk
to
compel
them
to
take
seven
and
save
their
souls
for
them
i
wanted
to
jump
up
in
my
seat
at
that
time
and
shout
amen
but
i
remembered
that
i
was
a
reporter
and
kept
still
it
was
that
same
winter
however
that
i
wrote
the
title
of
my
book
how
the
other
half
lives
and
copyrighted
it
the
book
itself
did
not
come
until
two
years
after
but
it
was
as
good
as
written
then
i
had
my
text
it
was
at
that
chickering
hall
meeting
that
i
heard
the
gospel
preached
to
the
poor
in
the
only
way
that
will
ever
reach
them
it
was
the
last
word
that
was
said
and
i
have
always
believed
that
it
was
not
exactly
in
the
plan
i
saw
some
venerable
brethren
on
the
platform
bishops
among
them
wince
when
charles
parkhurst
rending
some
eminently
respectable
platitudes
to
shreds
and
tatters
cried
out
for
personal
service
loving
touch
as
the
key
to
it
all
what
if
when
the
poor
leper
came
to
the
lord
to
be
healed
he
had
said
to
peter
or
some
other
understrapper
peter
you
go
touch
that
fellow
and
i
pay
you
for
it
or
what
if
the
lord
when
he
came
on
earth
had
come
a
day
at
a
time
and
brought
his
lunch
with
him
and
had
gone
home
to
heaven
overnight
would
the
world
ever
have
come
to
call
him
brother
we
have
got
to
give
not
our
old
clothes
not
our
prayers
those
are
cheap
you
can
kneel
down
on
a
carpet
and
pray
where
it
is
warm
and
comfortable
not
our
soup
that
is
sometimes
very
cheap
not
our
money
a
stingy
man
will
give
money
when
he
refuses
to
give
himself
just
so
soon
as
a
man
feels
that
you
sit
down
alongside
of
him
in
loving
sympathy
with
him
notwithstanding
his
poor
notwithstanding
his
sick
and
his
debased
estate
just
so
soon
you
begin
to
worm
your
way
into
the
very
warmest
spot
in
his
life
it
was
plain
talk
but
it
was
good
they
whispered
afterward
in
the
corners
about
the
lack
of
discretion
of
that
good
man
parkhurst
a
little
of
that
lack
would
go
a
long
way
toward
cleaning
up
in
new
york
did
go
not
so
many
years
after
worse
shocks
than
that
were
coming
from
the
same
quarter
to
rattle
the
dry
bones
long
before
that
the
something
that
needed
me
in
mulberry
street
had
come
i
was
in
a
vith
my
two
enemies
the
police
and
the
bend
the
adler
commission
had
proposed
to
break
the
back
of
the
latter
by
cutting
leonard
street
through
the
middle
of
it
an
expedient
that
had
been
suggested
forty
years
before
when
the
five
points
around
the
corner
challenged
the
angry
resentment
of
the
community
but
no
expedient
would
ever
cover
that
case
the
whole
slum
had
to
go
a
bill
was
introduced
in
the
legislature
to
wipe
it
out
bodily
and
in
after
four
years
of
pulling
and
hauling
we
had
spunked
up
enough
to
file
maps
for
the
mulberry
bend
park
blessed
promise
and
it
was
kept
if
it
did
take
a
prodigious
lot
of
effort
for
right
there
decency
had
to
begin
or
not
at
all
go
and
look
at
it
and
see
what
it
is
like
but
that
is
another
story
the
other
nuisance
came
first
the
first
guns
that
i
have
any
record
of
were
fired
in
my
newspapers
in
and
from
that
time
till
theodore
roosevelt
shut
up
the
vile
dens
in
the
battle
raged
without
intermission
the
guns
i
speak
of
were
not
the
first
that
were
fired
they
were
the
first
i
fired
so
far
as
i
can
find
for
quite
a
generation
before
that
there
had
been
protests
and
complaints
from
the
police
surgeons
the
policemen
themselves
who
hated
to
lodge
under
one
roof
with
tramps
from
citizen
bodies
that
saw
in
the
system
an
outrage
upon
christian
charity
and
all
decency
but
all
without
producing
any
other
effect
than
spasmodic
whitewashing
and
the
ineffectual
turning
on
of
the
hose
nothing
short
of
boiling
water
would
have
cleansed
those
dens
nothing
else
came
of
it
because
stronger
even
than
the
selfish
motive
that
exploits
public
office
for
private
gain
is
the
deadly
inertia
in
civic
life
which
simply
means
that
we
are
all
as
lazy
as
things
will
let
us
be
the
older
i
get
the
more
patience
i
have
with
the
sinner
and
the
less
with
the
lazy
who
is
at
the
bottom
of
more
than
half
the
share
of
the
world
troubles
give
me
the
thief
if
need
be
but
take
the
tramp
away
and
lock
him
up
at
hard
labor
until
he
is
willing
to
fall
in
line
and
take
up
his
end
the
end
he
lets
lie
some
one
has
got
to
carry
who
already
has
enough
i
ran
to
earth
at
last
one
of
the
citizens
bodies
that
were
striving
with
the
nuisance
and
went
and
joined
it
i
will
not
say
that
i
was
received
graciously
i
was
a
reporter
and
it
was
human
nature
to
assume
that
i
was
merely
after
a
sensation
and
i
did
make
a
sensation
of
the
campaign
that
was
the
way
to
put
life
into
it
page
after
page
i
printed
now
in
this
paper
now
in
that
and
when
the
round
was
completed
went
over
the
same
road
again
they
winced
a
bit
my
associates
but
bore
it
egged
me
on
even
anything
for
a
change
perchance
it
might
help
it
did
then
but
slowly
something
began
to
stir
the
editors
found
something
to
be
indignant
about
when
there
was
nothing
else
ponderous
leaders
about
our
duty
toward
the
poor
appeared
at
intervals
the
grand
jury
on
its
tours
saw
and
protested
the
city
hall
felt
the
sting
and
squirmed
i
remember
when
we
went
to
argue
with
the
board
of
estimate
and
apportionment
under
mayor
grant
it
was
my
first
meeting
with
josephine
shaw
lowell
and
john
finley
but
not
the
last
by
a
good
many
thank
god
for
that
i
had
gone
to
boston
to
see
the
humane
way
in
which
they
were
dealing
with
their
homeless
there
they
gave
them
a
clean
shirt
and
a
decent
bed
and
a
bath
good
way
that
to
limit
the
supply
of
tramps
and
something
to
eat
in
the
morning
so
they
did
not
have
to
go
out
and
beg
the
first
thing
it
seemed
good
to
me
and
it
was
good
but
the
mayor
did
not
think
so
boston
boston
he
cried
impatiently
and
waved
us
and
the
subject
aside
i
am
tired
of
hearing
always
how
they
do
in
boston
and
of
the
whole
matter
so
were
we
tired
enough
to
keep
it
up
we
came
back
next
time
though
it
did
do
any
good
and
meanwhile
the
newspaper
broadsides
continued
no
chance
was
allowed
to
pass
of
telling
the
people
of
new
york
what
they
were
harboring
they
simply
needed
to
know
i
felt
sure
of
that
and
i
know
now
that
i
was
right
but
it
takes
a
lot
of
telling
to
make
a
city
know
when
it
is
doing
wrong
however
that
was
what
i
was
there
for
when
it
did
seem
to
help
i
would
go
and
look
at
a
hammering
away
at
his
rock
perhaps
a
hundred
times
without
as
much
as
a
crack
showing
in
it
yet
at
the
hundred
and
first
blow
it
would
split
in
two
and
i
knew
it
was
not
that
blow
that
did
it
but
all
that
had
gone
before
together
when
my
smiled
i
used
to
remind
them
of
the
israelites
that
marched
seven
times
around
jericho
and
blew
their
horns
before
the
walls
fell
well
you
go
ahead
and
blow
yours
they
said
you
have
the
faith
and
i
did
and
the
walls
did
fall
though
it
took
nearly
twice
seven
years
but
they
came
down
as
the
walls
of
ignorance
and
indifference
must
every
time
if
you
blow
hard
enough
and
long
enough
with
faith
in
your
cause
and
in
your
it
is
just
a
question
of
endurance
if
you
keep
it
up
they
ca
they
began
to
give
those
grim
walls
when
typhus
fever
broke
out
in
the
city
in
the
winter
of
the
wonder
was
that
it
did
not
immediately
centre
in
the
police
there
they
lay
young
and
old
hardened
tramps
and
young
castaways
with
minds
and
souls
soft
as
wax
for
their
foulness
to
be
stamped
upon
footnote
the
old
cry
of
sensation
mongering
was
raised
more
than
once
when
i
was
making
my
charges
people
do
not
like
to
have
their
rest
disturbed
particularly
did
the
critics
object
to
the
statement
that
there
were
young
people
in
the
dens
they
were
all
old
tramps
they
said
for
an
answer
i
went
in
and
photographed
the
boys
and
girls
one
night
and
held
their
pictures
up
before
the
community
in
the
oak
street
station
alone
one
of
the
vilest
there
were
six
as
likely
young
fellows
as
i
ever
saw
herded
with
forty
tramps
and
thieves
not
one
of
them
would
come
out
unscathed
on
bare
floors
of
stone
or
planks
illustration
the
at
the
leonard
street
police
station
dirty
as
they
came
in
from
every
vile
contact
they
went
out
in
the
morning
to
scatter
from
door
to
door
where
they
begged
their
breakfast
the
seeds

festering
disease

typhus
is
a
of
all
the
most
dreaded
if
ever
it
got
a
foothold
in
those
dens
there
was
good
cause
for
fear
i
drew
up
at
once
a
remonstrance
had
it
signed
by
representatives
of
the
united
charitable
societies
some
of
them
shrugged
their
shoulders
but
they
signed
and
took
it
to
the
health
board
they
knew
the
danger
better
than
i
but
the
time
had
not
yet
come
perhaps
they
thought
with
the
reporters
that
i
was
just
making
copy
for
i
made
a
beat
of
the
story
of
course
i
did
we
were
fighting
and
if
i
could
brace
the
boys
up
to
the
point
of
running
their
own
campaigns
for
making
things
better
so
much
was
gained
but
they
did
not
take
the
hint
they
just
denounced
my
treachery
i
warned
them
that
there
would
be
trouble
with
the
and
within
eleven
months
the
prophecy
came
true
the
typhus
broke
out
the
night
after
the
news
had
come
i
took
my
camera
and
flashlight
and
made
the
round
of
the
dens
photographing
them
all
with
their
crowds
of
the
negatives
i
had
made
and
with
these
under
my
arm
knocked
at
the
doors
of
the
academy
of
medicine
demanding
to
be
let
in
that
was
the
place
for
that
discussion
it
seemed
to
me
for
the
doctors
knew
the
real
extent
of
the
peril
we
were
then
facing
typhus
is
no
respecter
of
persons
and
it
is
impossible
to
guard
against
it
as
against
the
smallpox
they
let
me
in
and
that
night
doings
gave
the
cause
of
decency
a
big
push
i
think
that
was
the
first
time
i
told
the
real
story
of
my
dog
i
had
always
got
around
it
somehow
it
choked
me
even
then
twenty
years
after
and
more
anger
boiled
up
in
me
so
at
the
recollection
we
pleaded
merely
for
the
execution
of
a
law
that
had
been
on
the
six
years
and
over
permitting
the
city
authorities
to
establish
a
decent
but
though
the
police
the
health
officials
the
grand
jury
the
charitable
societies
and
about
everybody
of
any
influence
in
the
community
fell
in
behind
the
medical
profession
in
denouncing
the
evils
that
were
we
pleaded
in
vain
the
tammany
officials
at
the
city
hall
told
us
insolently
to
go
ahead
and
build
ourselves
they
had
other
things
to
use
the
city
money
for
than
to
care
for
the
homeless
poor
which
indeed
was
true
the
charity
organization
society
that
stood
for
all
the
rest
gave
up
in
discouragement
and
announced
its
intention
to
start
a
wayfarer
lodge
itself
on
the
boston
plan
and
did
so
you
see
was
the
with
which
my
colaborers
left
me
we
will
never
succeed
my
campaign
had
collapsed
but
even
then
we
were
winning
never
was
defeat
in
all
that
time
that
did
not
in
the
end
turn
out
a
step
toward
victory
this
much
the
unceasing
agitation
had
effected
though
its
humane
purpose
made
no
impression
on
the
officials
that
the
accommodation
for
lodgers
in
the
was
sensibly
shrunk
where
there
had
been
forty
that
took
them
in
there
were
barely
two
dozen
left
the
demand
for
separate
women
prisons
with
police
matrons
in
charge
which
was
one
of
the
phases
the
new
demand
for
decency
was
assuming
bred
a
scarcity
of
and
one
by
one
the
foul
old
dens
were
closed
and
not
reopened
the
nuisance
was
perishing
of
itself
each
time
a
piece
of
it
sloughed
off
i
told
the
story
again
in
print
lest
we
forget
in
another
year
reform
came
and
with
it
came
roosevelt
the
committee
on
vagrancy
a
volunteer
body
of
the
charity
organization
society
of
which
lowell
was
the
head
and
i
a
member
unlimbered
its
guns
again
and
opened
fire
and
this
time
the
walls
came
down
for
tammany
was
out
we
had
been
looking
the
police
over
by
night
roosevelt
and
i
we
had
inspected
the
while
i
went
over
the
long
fight
with
him
and
had
come
at
last
at
to
the
church
street
station
it
was
raining
outside
the
light
flickered
cold
and
cheerless
in
the
green
lamps
as
we
went
up
the
stone
steps
involuntarily
i
looked
in
the
corner
for
my
little
dog
but
it
was
not
there
or
any
one
who
remembered
it
the
sergeant
glanced
over
his
blotter
grimly
i
had
almost
to
pinch
myself
to
make
sure
i
was
not
shivering
in
a
linen
duster
wet
to
the
skin
down
the
cellar
steps
to
the
men
i
led
the
president
of
the
police
board
it
was
unchanged
just
as
it
was
the
day
i
slept
there
three
men
lay
stretched
at
full
length
on
the
dirty
planks
two
of
them
young
lads
from
the
country
standing
there
i
told
roosevelt
my
own
story
he
turned
alternately
red
and
white
with
anger
as
he
heard
it
illustration
the
church
street
station
lodging
room
in
which
i
was
robbed
did
they
do
that
to
you
he
asked
when
i
had
ended
for
an
answer
i
pointed
to
the
young
lads
then
asleep
before
him
i
was
like
this
one
i
said
he
struck
his
clenched
fists
together
i
will
smash
them
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
the
very
next
day
the
police
board
took
the
matter
up
provision
was
made
for
the
homeless
on
a
barge
in
the
east
river
until
plans
could
be
perfected
for
sifting
the
tramps
from
the
unfortunate
and
within
a
week
on
recommendation
of
the
chief
of
police
orders
were
issued
to
close
the
doors
of
the
police
on
february
never
again
to
be
unbarred
the
battle
was
won
the
murder
of
my
dog
was
avenged
and
forgiven
after
years
the
yellow
newspapers
with
the
true
instinct
that
made
them
ever
recognize
in
roosevelt
the
implacable
enemy
of
all
they
stood
for
printed
cartoons
of
homeless
men
shivering
at
a
barred
door
closed
by
order
of
roosevelt
but
they
did
not
after
all
understand
the
man
they
were
attacking
that
the
thing
was
right
was
enough
for
him
their
shafts
went
wide
of
the
mark
or
fell
harmless
the
tramps
for
whom
new
york
had
been
a
paradise
betook
themselves
to
other
towns
not
so
discerning
went
to
chicago
where
the
same
wicked
system
was
in
operation
until
last
spring
is
yet
for
all
i
know
and
the
honestly
homeless
got
a
chance
a
few
and
citizens
of
the
kind
who
ever
obstruct
progress
by
getting
some
very
excellent
but
vagrant
impulses
mixed
up
with
a
lack
of
common
sense
wasted
their
sympathy
upon
the
departing
hobo
but
soon
tired
of
it
i
remember
the
case
of
one
tramp
whose
beat
was
in
the
block
in
street
in
which
parkhurst
lives
he
was
arrested
for
insolence
to
a
housekeeper
who
refused
him
food
the
magistrate
discharged
him
with
some
tearful
remarks
about
the
cruelty
and
the
right
of
a
man
to
be
poor
without
being
accounted
a
criminal
thus
encouraged
the
tramp
went
right
back
and
broke
the
windows
of
the
house
that
had
repelled
him
i
presume
he
is
now
in
the
city
by
the
lake
holding
up
people
who
offend
him
by
being
more
industrious
and
consequently
more
prosperous
than
he
for
the
general
results
of
the
victory
so
laboriously
achieved
i
must
refer
to
footnote
now
the
battle
with
the
slum
a
ten
years
war
in
which
i
endeavored
to
sum
up
the
situation
as
i
saw
it
they
are
not
worked
out
yet
to
the
full
the
most
important
link
is
missing
that
is
to
be
a
which
shall
sift
the
young
idler
from
the
heap
of
chaff
and
win
him
back
to
habits
of
industry
and
to
the
world
of
men
it
will
come
when
moral
purpose
has
been
reestablished
at
the
city
hall
i
have
not
set
out
here
to
discuss
reform
and
its
merits
but
merely
to
point
out
that
the
way
of
it
the
best
way
of
bringing
it
on
indeed
the
only
way
that
is
always
open
is
to
make
the
facts
of
the
wrong
plain
and
having
said
that
i
have
put
the
reporter
where
he
belongs
and
answered
the
question
why
i
have
never
wanted
executive
office
and
never
will
illustration
the
yellow
newspapers
contribution
and
now
in
taking
leave
of
this
subject
of
which
i
hope
i
may
never
hear
again
for
it
has
plagued
me
enough
and
had
its
full
share
of
my
life
is
there
not
one
ray
of
brightness
that
falls
athwart
its
gloom
were
they
all
bad
those
dens
i
hated
yes
hated
with
the
shame
and
the
sorrow
and
hopeless
surrender
they
stood
for
was
there
not
one
glimpse
of
mercy
that
dwells
in
the
memory
with
redeeming
touch
yes
one
let
it
stand
as
testimony
that
on
the
brink
of
hell
itself
human
nature
is
not
wholly
lost
there
is
still
the
spark
of
his
image
however
overlaid
by
the
slum
and
let
it
forever
wipe
out
the
score
of
my
dog
and
mine
it
was
in
one
of
the
worst
that
i
came
upon
a
young
girl
pretty
innocent
heaven
knows
how
she
had
landed
there
she
hid
her
head
in
her
apron
and
wept
bitterly
with
the
shame
of
the
thing
around
her
half
a
dozen
old
hags
and
foul
camped
on
the
stone
floor
as
in
passing
i
stooped
over
the
weeping
girl
one
of
them
thinking
i
was
one
of
the
men
about
the
place
and
misunderstanding
my
purpose
sprang
between
us
like
a
tigress
and
pushed
me
back
not
her
she
cried
and
shook
her
fist
at
me
not
her
it
is
all
right
with
us
we
are
old
and
tough
but
she
is
young
and
you
dare
i
went
out
and
stood
under
the
stars
and
thanked
god
that
i
was
born
only
tramps
it
had
been
dinned
into
my
ears
until
i
said
it
myself
god
forgive
me
aye
that
was
what
we
had
made
of
them
with
our
infernal
machinery
of
tenement
dive
and
this
place
with
christian
charity
instead
what
might
they
not
have
been
chapter
xi
the
bend
is
laid
by
the
heels
if
there
be
any
to
whom
the
travail
through
which
we
have
just
come
seems
like
a
mighty
tempest
in
a
teapot
let
him
quit
thinking
so
it
was
not
a
small
matter
to
be
sure
the
wrong
could
have
been
undone
in
a
day
by
the
authorities
had
they
been
so
minded
that
it
was
not
undone
was
largely
and
illogically
because
no
one
had
a
word
to
say
in
its
defence
when
there
are
two
sides
to
a
thing
it
is
not
difficult
to
get
at
the
right
of
it
in
an
argument
and
to
carry
public
opinion
for
the
right
but
when
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
be
said
against
a
proposed
reform
it
seems
to
be
human
nature
american
human
nature
at
all
events
to
expect
it
to
carry
itself
through
with
the
general
good
wishes
but
no
particular
lift
from
any
one
it
is
a
very
charming
expression
of
our
faith
in
the
power
of
the
right
to
make
its
way
only
it
is
all
wrong
it
will
not
make
its
way
in
the
generation
that
sits
by
to
see
it
move
it
has
got
to
be
moved
along
like
everything
else
in
this
world
by
men
that
is
how
we
take
title
to
the
name
that
is
what
is
the
matter
with
half
our
laws
the
other
half
were
just
it
is
so
at
this
moment
with
the
children
playgrounds
in
new
york
probably
all
thinking
people
subscribe
to
the
statement
that
it
is
the
business
of
the
municipality
to
give
its
children
a
chance
to
play
just
as
much
as
to
give
them
schools
to
go
to
everybody
applauds
it
the
authorities
do
not
question
it
but
still
they
do
not
provide
playgrounds
private
charity
has
to
keep
a
beggarly
going
where
there
ought
to
be
forty
or
fifty
as
a
matter
of
right
not
of
charity
call
it
official
conservatism
inertia
treachery
call
it
by
soft
names
or
hard
in
the
end
it
comes
to
this
i
suppose
that
it
is
the
whetstone
upon
which
our
purpose
is
sharpened
and
in
that
sense
we
have
apparently
got
to
be
thankful
for
it
so
a
man
may
pummel
his
adversary
and
accept
him
as
a
means
of
grace
at
the
same
time
if
there
were
no
snags
there
would
be
no
wits
to
clear
them
away
or
strong
arms
to
wield
the
axe
it
was
the
same
story
with
the
mulberry
bend
until
the
tramp
were
closed
until
the
bend
was
gone
it
seemed
as
if
progress
were
flat
down
impossible
as
i
said
decency
had
to
begin
there
or
not
at
all
illustration
the
mulberry
bend
as
it
was
before
i
tackle
the
bend
perhaps
i
had
better
explain
how
i
came
to
take
up
photographing
as
a
no
not
exactly
as
a
pastime
it
was
never
that
with
me
i
had
use
for
it
and
beyond
that
i
never
went
i
am
downright
sorry
to
confess
here
that
i
am
no
good
at
all
as
a
photographer
for
i
would
like
to
be
the
thing
is
a
constant
marvel
to
me
and
an
unending
delight
to
watch
the
picture
come
out
upon
the
plate
that
was
blank
before
and
that
saw
with
me
for
perhaps
the
merest
fraction
of
a
second
maybe
months
before
the
thing
it
has
never
forgotten
is
a
new
miracle
every
time
if
i
were
a
clergyman
i
would
practise
photography
and
preach
about
it
but
i
am
jealous
of
the
miracle
i
do
not
want
it
explained
to
me
in
terms
of
ho
or
such
like
formulas
learned
but
so
hopelessly
unsatisfying
i
do
not
want
my
butterfly
stuck
on
a
pin
and
put
in
a
glass
case
i
want
to
see
the
sunlight
on
its
wings
as
it
flits
from
flower
to
flower
and
i
do
care
a
rap
what
its
latin
name
may
be
anyway
it
is
not
its
name
the
sun
and
the
flower
and
the
butterfly
know
that
the
man
who
sticks
a
pin
in
it
does
not
and
never
will
for
he
knows
not
its
language
only
the
poet
does
among
men
so
you
see
i
am
disqualified
from
being
a
photographer
also
i
am
clumsy
and
impatient
of
details
the
axe
was
ever
more
to
my
liking
than
the
i
have
lived
to
see
the
day
of
the
axe
and
enjoy
it
and
now
i
rejoice
in
the
coming
of
the
men
and
women
who
know
the
jane
addamses
who
to
heart
add
knowledge
and
training
and
with
gentle
hands
bind
up
wounds
which
alas
too
often
i
struck
it
is
as
it
should
be
i
only
wish
they
would
see
it
and
leave
me
out
for
my
sins
but
there
i
started
out
to
tell
about
how
i
came
to
be
a
photographer
and
here
i
am
off
on
the
subject
of
philanthropy
and
social
settlements
to
be
precise
then
i
began
taking
pictures
by
proxy
it
was
upon
my
midnight
trips
with
the
sanitary
police
that
the
wish
kept
cropping
up
in
me
that
there
were
some
way
of
putting
before
the
people
what
i
saw
there
a
drawing
might
have
done
it
but
i
can
not
draw
never
could
there
are
certain
sketches
of
mine
now
on
record
that
always
arouse
the
boisterous
hilarity
of
the
family
they
were
made
for
the
instruction
of
our
first
baby
in
and
i
know
they
were
highly
appreciated
by
him
at
the
time
maybe
the
fashion
in
wolves
has
changed
since
but
anyway
a
drawing
would
not
have
been
evidence
of
the
kind
i
wanted
we
used
to
go
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
into
the
worst
tenements
to
count
noses
and
see
if
the
law
against
overcrowding
was
violated
and
the
sights
i
saw
there
gripped
my
heart
until
i
felt
that
i
must
tell
of
them
or
burst
or
turn
anarchist
or
something
a
man
may
be
a
man
even
in
a
palace
in
modern
new
york
as
in
ancient
rome
but
not
in
a
slum
tenement
so
it
seemed
to
me
and
in
anger
i
looked
around
for
something
to
strike
off
his
fetters
with
but
there
was
nothing
i
wrote
but
it
seemed
to
make
no
impression
one
morning
scanning
my
newspaper
at
the
breakfast
table
i
put
it
down
with
an
outcry
that
startled
my
wife
sitting
opposite
there
it
was
the
thing
i
had
been
looking
for
all
those
years
a
despatch
from
somewhere
in
germany
if
i
remember
right
had
it
all
a
way
had
been
discovered
it
ran
to
take
pictures
by
flashlight
the
darkest
corner
might
be
photographed
that
way
i
went
to
the
office
full
of
the
idea
and
lost
no
time
in
looking
up
john
nagle
at
the
time
in
charge
of
the
bureau
of
vital
statistics
in
the
health
department
to
tell
him
of
it
nagle
was
an
amateur
photographer
of
merit
and
a
good
fellow
besides
who
entered
into
my
plans
with
great
readiness
the
news
had
already
excited
much
interest
among
new
york
photographers
professional
and
otherwise
and
no
time
was
lost
in
communicating
with
the
other
side
within
a
fortnight
a
raiding
party
composed
of
henry
piffard
and
richard
hoe
lawrence
two
distinguished
amateurs
nagle
and
myself
and
sometimes
a
policeman
or
two
invaded
the
east
side
by
night
bent
on
letting
in
the
light
where
it
was
so
much
needed
at
least
that
was
my
purpose
to
the
photographers
it
was
a
voyage
of
discovery
of
the
greatest
interest
but
the
interest
centred
in
the
camera
and
the
flashlight
the
police
went
along
from
curiosity
sometimes
for
protection
for
that
they
were
hardly
needed
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
our
party
carried
terror
wherever
it
went
the
flashlight
of
those
days
was
contained
in
cartridges
fired
from
a
revolver
the
spectacle
of
half
a
dozen
strange
men
invading
a
house
in
the
midnight
hour
armed
with
big
pistols
which
they
shot
off
recklessly
was
hardly
reassuring
however
sugary
our
speech
and
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
the
tenants
bolted
through
windows
and
down
wherever
we
went
but
as
no
one
was
murdered
things
calmed
down
after
a
while
though
months
after
i
found
the
recollection
of
our
visits
hanging
over
a
stanton
street
block
like
a
nightmare
we
got
some
good
pictures
but
very
soon
the
slum
and
the
awkward
hours
palled
upon
the
amateurs
i
found
myself
alone
just
when
i
needed
help
most
i
had
made
out
by
the
flashlight
possibilities
my
companions
little
dreamed
of
illustration
the
tenants
bolted
through
the
windows
i
hired
a
professional
photographer
next
whom
i
found
in
dire
straits
he
was
even
less
willing
to
get
up
at
than
my
friends
who
had
a
good
excuse
he
had
none
for
i
paid
him
well
he
repaid
me
by
trying
to
sell
my
photographs
behind
my
back
i
had
to
replevin
the
negatives
to
get
them
away
from
him
he
was
a
pious
man
i
take
it
for
when
i
tried
to
have
him
photograph
the
waifs
in
the
baby
nursery
at
the
five
points
house
of
industry
as
they
were
saying
their
now
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
and
the
plate
came
out
blank
the
second
time
he
owned
up
that
it
was
his
doing
it
went
against
his
principles
to
take
a
picture
of
any
one
at
prayers
so
i
had
to
get
another
man
with
some
trouble
and
expense
but
on
the
whole
i
think
the
experience
was
worth
what
it
cost
the
spectacle
of
a
man
prevented
by
religious
scruples
from
photographing
children
at
prayers
while
plotting
at
the
same
time
to
rob
his
employer
has
been
a
kind
of
chart
to
me
that
has
piloted
me
through
more
than
one
quagmire
of
queer
human
nature
nothing
could
stump
me
after
that
the
man
was
just
as
sincere
in
the
matter
of
his
scruple
as
he
was
rascally
in
his
business
dealings
with
me
there
was
at
last
but
one
way
out
of
it
namely
for
me
to
get
a
camera
myself
this
i
did
and
with
a
dozen
plates
took
myself
up
the
sound
to
the
potter
field
on
its
desert
island
to
make
my
first
observations
there
at
least
i
should
be
alone
with
no
one
to
bother
me
and
i
wanted
a
picture
of
the
open
trench
i
got
it
too
when
i
say
that
with
the
sunlight
of
a
january
day
on
the
white
snow
i
exposed
that
instantaneous
plate
first
for
six
seconds
then
for
twelve
to
make
sure
i
got
the
picture
footnote
men
are
ever
prone
to
doubt
what
they
can
not
understand
with
all
the
accumulated
information
on
the
subject
even
to
this
day
when
it
comes
to
taking
a
at
the
last
moment
i
weaken
and
take
it
under
protest
refusing
to
believe
that
it
can
be
a
little
more
faith
would
make
a
much
better
photographer
of
me
and
then
put
the
back
among
the
rest
so
that
i
did
not
know
which
was
which
amateur
photographers
will
understand
the
situation
i
had
to
develop
the
whole
twelve
to
get
one
picture
that
was
so
dark
almost
black
from
as
to
be
almost
hopeless
but
where
there
is
life
there
is
hope
if
you
can
apply
that
maxim
to
the
potter
field
where
there
are
none
but
dead
men
the
very
blackness
of
my
picture
proved
later
on
when
i
came
to
use
it
with
a
magic
lantern
the
taking
feature
of
it
it
added
a
gloom
to
the
show
more
realistic
than
any
the
utmost
art
of
professional
skill
might
have
attained
so
i
became
a
photographer
after
a
fashion
and
thereafter
took
the
pictures
myself
i
substituted
a
for
the
revolver
and
flashed
the
light
on
that
it
seemed
more
homelike
but
as
i
said
i
am
clumsy
twice
i
set
fire
to
the
house
with
the
apparatus
and
once
to
myself
i
blew
the
light
into
my
own
eyes
on
that
occasion
and
only
my
spectacles
saved
me
from
being
blinded
for
life
for
more
than
an
hour
after
i
could
see
nothing
and
was
led
about
by
my
companion
helpless
photographing
joss
in
chinatown
nearly
caused
a
riot
there
it
seems
that
it
was
against
religious
principles
peace
was
made
only
upon
express
assurance
being
given
the
guardians
of
joss
that
his
picture
would
be
hung
in
the
gallery
at
police
headquarters
they
took
it
as
a
compliment
the
gallery
at
headquarters
is
the
rogues
gallery
not
generally
much
desired
those
chinese
are
a
queer
lot
but
when
i
remembered
my
christian
friend
of
the
nursery
i
did
not
find
it
in
me
to
blame
them
once
when
i
was
taking
pictures
about
hell
kitchen
i
was
confronted
by
a
man
with
a
club
who
required
me
to
subscribe
to
a
general
condemnation
of
reporters
as
hardly
fit
to
be
flayed
alive
before
he
would
let
me
go
the
which
i
did
with
a
right
good
will
though
with
somewhat
of
a
mental
reservation
in
favor
of
my
rivals
in
mulberry
street
who
just
then
stood
in
need
of
special
correction
what
with
one
thing
and
another
and
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
i
got
my
pictures
and
put
some
of
them
to
practical
use
at
once
i
recall
a
midnight
expedition
to
the
mulberry
bend
with
the
sanitary
police
that
had
turned
up
a
couple
of
characteristic
cases
of
overcrowding
in
one
instance
two
rooms
that
should
at
most
have
held
four
or
five
sleepers
were
found
to
contain
fifteen
a
baby
among
them
most
of
them
were
lodgers
and
slept
there
for
five
cents
a
spot
there
was
no
pretence
of
beds
when
the
report
was
submitted
to
the
health
board
the
next
day
it
did
not
make
much
of
an
impression
these
things
rarely
do
put
in
mere
words
until
my
negatives
still
dripping
from
the
came
to
reenforce
them
from
them
there
was
no
appeal
it
was
not
the
only
instance
of
the
kind
by
a
good
many
neither
the
landlord
protests
nor
the
tenant
plea
went
in
face
of
the
camera
evidence
and
i
was
satisfied
illustration
lodgers
at
five
cents
a
spot
i
had
at
last
an
ally
in
the
fight
with
the
bend
it
was
needed
worse
even
than
in
the
campaign
against
the
police
for
in
that
we
were
a
company
in
the
bend
i
was
alone
from
the
day
i
think
it
was
in
the
winter
of
when
it
was
officially
doomed
to
go
by
act
of
legislature
until
it
did
go
nine
years
later
i
can
not
remember
that
a
cat
stirred
to
urge
it
on
whether
it
was
that
it
had
been
bad
so
long
that
people
thought
it
could
not
be
otherwise
or
because
the
five
points
had
taken
all
the
reform
the
sixth
ward
had
coming
to
it
or
because
by
a
sort
of
tacit
consent
the
whole
matter
was
left
to
me
as
the
recognized
mulberry
bend
crank
whichever
it
was
this
last
was
the
practical
turn
it
took
i
was
left
to
fight
it
out
by
myself
which
being
so
i
laid
in
a
stock
of
dry
plates
and
buckled
to
the
bend
was
a
much
jollier
adversary
than
the
police
it
kicked
back
it
did
not
have
to
be
dragged
into
the
discussion
at
intervals
but
crowded
in
unbidden
in
the
twenty
years
of
my
acquaintance
with
it
as
a
reporter
i
do
not
believe
there
was
a
week
in
which
it
was
not
heard
from
in
the
police
reports
generally
in
connection
with
a
crime
of
violence
a
murder
or
a
stabbing
affray
it
was
usually
on
sunday
when
the
italians
who
lived
there
were
idle
and
quarreled
over
their
cards
every
fight
was
the
signal
for
at
least
two
more
sometimes
a
dozen
for
they
clung
to
their
traditions
and
met
all
efforts
of
the
police
to
get
at
the
facts
with
their
stubborn
fix
him
myself
and
when
the
detectives
had
given
up
in
dismay
and
the
man
who
was
cut
had
got
out
of
the
hospital
pretty
soon
there
was
news
of
another
fight
and
the
feud
had
been
sent
on
one
step
by
far
the
most
cheering
testimony
that
our
italian
is
becoming
one
of
us
came
to
me
a
year
or
two
ago
in
the
evidence
that
on
two
occasions
mulberry
street
had
refused
to
hide
a
murderer
even
in
his
own
village
footnote
the
italians
here
live
usually
grouped
by
villages
that
is
those
from
the
same
community
with
the
same
patron
saint
keep
close
together
the
saint
is
their
local
holiday
if
the
police
want
to
find
an
italian
scamp
they
find
out
first
from
what
village
he
hails
then
it
is
a
simple
matter
usually
to
find
where
he
is
located
in
the
city
that
was
conclusive
it
was
not
so
in
those
days
so
between
the
vendetta
the
mafia
the
ordinary
neighborhood
feuds
and
the
bend
itself
always
picturesque
if
outrageously
dirty
it
was
not
hard
to
keep
it
in
the
foreground
my
from
the
year
to
is
one
running
comment
on
the
bend
and
upon
the
official
indolence
that
delayed
its
demolition
nearly
a
decade
after
it
had
been
decreed
but
it
all
availed
nothing
to
hurry
up
things
until
in
a
swaggering
moment
after
four
years
of
that
sort
of
thing
one
of
the
city
hall
officials
condescended
to
inform
me
of
the
real
cause
of
the
delay
it
was
simply
that
no
one
down
there
had
been
taking
any
interest
in
the
thing
illustration
bandits
roost
a
mulberry
bend
alley
i
could
not
have
laid
it
out
for
him
to
suit
my
case
better
than
he
did
it
was
in
the
silly
season
and
the
newspapers
fell
greedily
upon
the
sensation
i
made
the
bend
moreover
smelled
rather
worse
than
usual
that
august
they
made
the
people
cause
their
own
and
shouted
treason
until
the
commission
charged
with
condemning
the
bend
actually
did
meet
and
greased
its
wheels
but
at
the
next
turn
they
were
down
in
a
rut
again
and
the
team
had
to
be
prodded
some
more
it
had
taken
two
years
to
get
a
map
of
the
proposed
park
filed
under
the
law
that
authorized
the
laying
out
of
it
the
commission
consumed
nearly
six
years
in
condemning
the
lots
of
property
and
charged
the
city
for
it
the
bend
itself
cost
a
million
and
an
assessment
of
half
a
million
was
laid
upon
surrounding
property
for
the
supposed
benefit
of
making
it
over
from
a
into
a
park
those
knew
better
they
hired
a
lawyer
who
in
less
than
six
weeks
persuaded
the
legislature
that
it
was
an
injury
not
a
benefit
the
town
had
to
foot
the
whole
bill
but
at
last
it
owned
the
bend
instead
of
destroying
it
neck
and
crop
it
settled
down
complacently
to
collect
the
rents
that
is
to
say
such
rents
as
it
could
collect
a
good
many
of
the
tenants
refused
to
pay
and
lived
rent
free
for
a
year
it
was
a
rare
chance
for
the
reporter
and
i
did
not
miss
it
the
city
as
landlord
in
the
bend
was
fair
game
the
old
houses
came
down
at
last
and
for
a
twelvemonth
while
a
reform
government
sat
at
the
city
hall
the
lot
lay
a
veritable
slough
of
despond
filled
with
unutterable
nastiness
festering
in
the
sight
of
men
no
amount
of
prodding
seemed
able
to
get
it
out
of
that
and
all
the
while
money
given
for
the
relief
of
the
people
was
going
to
waste
at
the
rate
of
a
million
dollars
a
year
the
small
parks
act
of
appropriated
that
amount
and
it
was
to
be
had
for
the
asking
but
no
one
who
had
the
authority
asked
and
as
the
appropriation
was
not
cumulative
each
passing
year
saw
the
loss
of
just
so
much
to
the
cause
of
decency
that
was
waiting
without
eight
millions
had
been
thrown
away
when
they
finally
came
to
ask
a
million
and
a
half
to
pay
for
the
mulberry
bend
park
and
then
they
had
to
get
a
special
law
and
a
special
appropriation
because
the
amount
was
more
than
a
million
in
one
year
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
were
then
in
the
christmas
holidays
with
one
year
just
closing
and
the
other
opening
each
with
its
unclaimed
appropriation
i
suggested
that
to
the
powers
that
were
but
they
threw
up
their
hands
that
would
have
been
irregular
and
quite
without
precedent
oh
for
irregularity
enough
to
throttle
precedent
finally
and
for
good
it
has
made
more
mischief
in
the
world
i
verily
believe
than
all
the
other
lawbreakers
together
at
the
very
outset
it
had
wrecked
my
hopes
of
getting
the
first
school
playground
in
new
york
planted
in
the
bend
by
simply
joining
park
and
school
together
there
was
a
public
school
in
the
block
that
went
with
the
rest
the
small
parks
law
expressly
provided
for
the
construction
of
such
and
so
many
buildings
for
the
comfort
health
and
instruction
of
the
people
as
might
be
necessary
but
a
school
in
a
park
the
thing
had
never
been
heard
of
it
would
lead
to
conflict
between
two
departments
and
to
this
day
there
is
no
playground
in
the
mulberry
bend
though
the
school
is
right
opposite
illustration
bottle
alley
mulberry
bend
headquarters
of
the
whyo
gang
it
was
nevertheless
that
sort
of
thing
that
lent
the
inspiration
which
in
the
end
made
the
old
bend
go
it
was
when
in
the
midst
of
the
discussion
they
showed
me
a
check
for
three
cents
hung
up
and
framed
in
the
comptroller
office
as
a
kind
of
joss
for
the
clerks
to
to
i
suppose
they
were
part
of
the
system
it
glorified
the
three
cents
had
miscarried
in
the
purchase
of
a
school
site
and
when
the
error
was
found
were
checked
out
with
all
the
fuss
and
flourish
of
a
transaction
in
millions
and
at
a
cost
i
was
told
of
fifty
dollars
worth
of
time
and
trouble
therefore
it
was
hung
up
to
be
forever
admired
as
the
ripe
fruit
of
an
infallible
system
no
doubt
it
will
be
there
when
another
tweed
has
cleaned
out
the
city
treasury
to
the
last
cent
however
it
suggested
a
way
out
to
me
two
could
play
at
that
game
there
is
a
familiar
principle
of
sanitary
law
expressed
in
more
than
one
ordinance
that
no
citizen
has
a
right
to
maintain
a
nuisance
on
his
premises
because
he
is
lazy
or
it
suits
his
convenience
in
other
ways
the
city
is
merely
the
aggregate
of
citizens
in
a
corporation
and
must
be
subject
to
the
same
rules
i
drew
up
a
complaint
in
proper
official
phrase
charging
that
the
state
of
mulberry
bend
was
detrimental
to
health
and
dangerous
to
life
and
formally
arraigned
the
municipality
before
the
health
board
for
maintaining
a
nuisance
upon
its
premises
i
have
still
a
copy
of
that
complaint
and
as
the
parting
shot
to
the
worst
slum
that
ever
was
and
let
us
hope
ever
will
be
i
quote
it
here
in
part
the
bend
is
a
mass
of
wreck
a
for
all
manner
of
filth
from
the
surrounding
tenements
the
department
has
no
jurisdiction
over
it
and
the
park
department
in
charge
of
which
it
is
exercises
none
the
numerous
old
cellars
are
a
source
of
danger
to
the
children
that
swarm
over
the
block
water
stagnating
in
the
holes
will
shortly
add
the
peril
of
epidemic
disease
such
a
condition
as
that
now
prevailing
in
this
block
with
its
dense
surrounding
population
would
not
be
tolerated
by
your
department
for
a
single
day
if
on
private
property
it
has
lasted
here
many
months
the
property
is
owned
by
the
city
having
been
taken
for
the
purposes
of
a
park
and
left
in
this
condition
after
the
demolition
of
the
old
buildings
the
undersigned
respectfully
represents
that
the
city
in
the
proposed
mulberry
bend
park
is
at
present
maintaining
a
nuisance
and
that
it
is
the
duty
of
your
honorable
board
to
see
to
it
that
it
is
forthwith
abolished
to
which
end
he
prays
that
you
will
proceed
at
once
with
the
enforcement
of
the
rules
of
your
department
prohibiting
the
maintaining
of
nuisances
within
the
city
limits
if
my
complaint
caused
a
smile
in
official
quarters
it
was
except
in
the
sanitary
bureau
where
i
fancy
it
lurked
for
the
bend
was
under
its
windows
one
whiff
of
it
was
enough
to
determine
the
kind
of
report
the
health
inspectors
would
have
to
make
when
forced
to
act
that
night
before
they
got
around
some
boys
playing
with
a
truck
in
the
lots
ran
it
down
into
one
of
the
cellar
holes
spoken
of
and
were
crushed
under
it
and
so
put
a
point
upon
the
matter
that
took
the
laughter
out
of
it
for
good
they
went
ahead
with
the
park
then
when
they
had
laid
the
sod
and
i
came
and
walked
on
it
in
defiance
of
the
sign
to
keep
off
the
grass
i
was
whacked
by
a
policeman
for
doing
it
as
i
told
in
the
ten
years
war
footnote
now
the
battle
with
the
slum
but
that
was
all
right
we
had
the
park
and
i
had
been
moved
on
before
when
i
sat
and
shivered
in
reeking
hallways
in
that
very
spot
alone
and
forlorn
in
the
long
ago
so
that
i
did
not
mind
the
children
who
were
dancing
there
in
the
sunlight
were
to
have
a
better
time
please
god
we
had
given
them
their
lost
chance
looking
at
them
in
their
delight
now
it
is
not
hard
to
understand
what
happened
the
place
that
had
been
redolent
of
crime
and
murder
became
the
most
orderly
in
the
city
when
the
last
house
was
torn
down
in
the
bend
i
counted
seventeen
murders
in
the
block
all
the
details
of
which
i
remembered
no
doubt
i
had
forgotten
several
times
that
number
in
the
four
years
after
that
during
which
i
remained
in
mulberry
street
i
was
called
only
once
to
record
a
deed
of
violence
in
the
neighborhood
and
that
was
when
a
stranger
came
in
and
killed
himself
nor
had
the
bend
simply
sloughed
off
its
wickedness
for
it
to
lodge
and
take
root
in
some
other
place
that
would
have
been
something
but
it
was
not
that
the
bend
had
become
decent
and
orderly
because
the
sunlight
was
let
in
and
shone
upon
children
who
had
at
last
the
right
to
play
even
if
the
sign
keep
off
the
grass
was
still
there
that
was
what
the
mulberry
bend
park
meant
it
was
the
story
it
had
to
tell
and
as
for
the
sign
we
shall
see
the
last
of
that
yet
the
park
has
notice
served
upon
it
that
its
time
is
up
illustration
the
mulberry
bend
as
it
is
so
the
bend
went
and
mighty
glad
am
i
that
i
had
a
hand
in
making
it
go
the
newspapers
puzzled
over
the
fact
that
i
was
not
invited
to
the
formal
opening
i
was
secretary
of
the
small
parks
committee
at
the
time
and
presumably
even
officially
entitled
to
be
bidden
to
the
show
though
come
to
think
of
it
our
committee
was
a
citizens
affair
and
not
on
the
the
tammany
mayor
who
came
in
the
year
after
said
that
we
had
as
much
authority
as
a
committee
of
bootblacks
about
the
city
hall
no
more
so
that
it
seems
as
if
there
is
a
something
that
governs
those
things
which
survives
the
accidents
of
politics
and
which
mere
citizens
are
not
supposed
to
understand
or
meddle
with
anyway
it
was
best
so
colonel
waring
splendid
fellow
that
he
was
when
he
grew
tired
of
the
much
talk
made
a
little
speech
of
ten
words
that
was
not
on
the
programme
and
after
that
the
politicians
went
home
leaving
the
park
to
the
children
there
it
was
in
the
right
hands
what
mattered
the
rest
then
and
now
let
me
go
back
from
the
slum
to
my
brooklyn
home
for
just
a
look
i
did
every
night
or
i
do
not
think
i
could
have
stood
it
i
never
lived
in
new
york
since
i
had
a
home
except
for
the
briefest
spell
of
a
couple
of
months
once
when
my
family
were
away
and
that
nearly
stifled
me
i
have
to
be
where
there
are
trees
and
birds
and
green
hills
and
where
the
sky
is
blue
above
so
we
built
our
nest
in
brooklyn
on
the
outskirts
of
the
great
park
while
the
fledglings
grew
and
the
nest
was
full
when
the
last
of
our
little
pile
had
gone
to
make
it
snug
rent
was
getting
higher
all
the
time
and
the
deeper
i
burrowed
in
the
slum
the
more
my
thoughts
turned
by
a
sort
of
defensive
instinct
to
the
country
my
wife
laughed
and
said
i
should
have
thought
of
that
while
we
yet
had
some
money
to
buy
or
build
with
but
i
borrowed
no
trouble
on
that
score
i
was
never
a
good
business
man
as
i
have
said
before
and
yet
no
i
will
take
that
back
it
is
going
back
on
the
record
i
trusted
my
accounts
with
the
great
paymaster
who
has
all
the
money
there
is
and
he
never
gave
notice
that
i
had
overdrawn
my
account
i
had
the
feeling
and
have
it
still
that
if
you
are
trying
to
do
the
things
which
are
right
and
which
you
were
put
here
to
do
you
can
and
ought
to
leave
ways
and
means
to
him
who
drew
the
plans
after
you
have
done
your
own
level
best
to
provide
always
that
of
course
if
then
things
do
come
out
right
it
is
the
best
proof
in
the
world
to
my
mind
that
you
have
got
it
wrong
and
you
have
only
to
hammer
away
waiting
for
things
to
shape
themselves
as
they
are
bound
to
do
and
let
in
the
light
for
nothing
in
all
this
world
is
without
a
purpose
and
least
of
all
what
you
and
i
are
doing
though
we
may
not
be
able
to
make
it
out
i
got
that
faith
from
my
mother
and
it
never
put
her
to
shame
so
she
has
often
told
me
neither
did
it
me
it
was
in
the
winter
when
all
our
children
had
the
scarlet
fever
that
one
sunday
when
i
was
taking
a
long
walk
out
on
long
island
where
i
could
do
no
one
any
harm
i
came
upon
richmond
hill
and
thought
it
was
the
most
beautiful
spot
i
had
ever
seen
i
went
home
and
told
my
wife
that
i
had
found
the
place
where
we
were
going
to
live
and
that
was
filled
with
the
scent
of
spring
flowers
and
of
balsam
and
pine
as
the
children
listened
and
cheered
with
their
feeble
little
voices
the
very
next
week
i
picked
out
the
lots
i
wanted
there
was
a
tangle
of
trees
growing
on
them
that
are
shading
my
study
window
now
as
i
write
i
did
not
have
any
money
but
right
then
an
insurance
company
was
in
need
of
some
one
to
revise
its
danish
policies
and
my
old
friend
general
christensen
thought
i
would
do
and
i
did
it
and
earned
whereupon
edward
wells
who
was
then
a
prosperous
druggist
offered
to
lend
me
what
more
i
needed
to
buy
the
lots
and
the
manager
of
our
press
bureau
built
me
a
house
and
took
a
mortgage
for
all
it
cost
so
before
the
next
winter
snows
we
were
snug
in
the
house
that
has
been
ours
ever
since
with
a
ridge
of
wooded
hills
the
backbone
of
long
island
between
new
york
and
us
the
very
lights
of
the
city
were
shut
out
so
was
the
slum
and
i
could
sleep
illustration
my
little
ones
gathering
daisies
for
poors
fifteen
summers
have
passed
since
the
house
lies
yonder
white
and
peaceful
under
the
trees
long
since
the
last
dollar
of
the
mortgage
was
paid
and
our
home
freed
from
debt
footnote
i
have
had
my
study
built
on
the
back
lawn
so
that
i
may
always
have
it
before
me
and
have
a
quiet
place
at
the
same
time
where
papa
is
not
to
be
disturbed
but
though
i
put
it
as
far
back
as
i
could
i
notice
that
they
come
right
in
the
flag
flies
from
it
on
sundays
in
token
thereof
joy
and
sorrow
have
come
to
us
under
its
roof
children
have
been
born
and
one
we
carried
over
the
hill
to
the
churchyard
with
tears
for
the
baby
we
had
lost
but
he
to
whom
we
gave
it
back
has
turned
our
grief
to
joy
of
all
our
babies
the
one
we
lost
is
the
only
one
we
have
kept
the
others
grew
out
of
our
arms
i
hardly
remember
them
in
their
little
white
slips
but
he
is
our
baby
forever
fifteen
happy
years
of
peace
have
they
been
for
love
held
the
course
it
was
when
the
daisies
bloomed
in
the
spring
that
the
children
brought
in
armfuls
from
the
fields
and
bade
me
take
them
to
the
poors
in
the
city
i
did
as
they
bade
me
but
i
never
got
more
than
half
a
block
from
the
ferry
with
my
burden
the
street
children
went
wild
over
the
posies
they
pleaded
and
fought
to
get
near
me
and
when
i
had
no
flowers
left
to
give
them
sat
in
the
gutter
and
wept
with
grief
the
sight
of
it
went
to
my
heart
and
i
wrote
this
letter
to
the
papers
it
is
dated
in
my
june
the
trains
that
carry
a
hundred
thousand
people
to
new
stores
and
offices
from
their
homes
in
the
country
rush
over
fields
these
bright
june
mornings
glorious
with
daisies
and
clover
blossoms
there
are
too
many
sad
little
eyes
in
the
crowded
tenements
where
the
summer
sunshine
means
disease
and
death
not
play
or
vacation
that
will
close
without
ever
having
looked
upon
a
field
of
daisies
if
we
can
not
give
them
the
fields
why
not
the
flowers
if
every
man
woman
or
child
coming
in
should
on
the
way
to
the
depot
gather
an
armful
of
wild
flowers
to
distribute
in
the
tenements
a
mission
work
would
be
set
on
foot
with
which
all
the
of
this
wealthy
city
could
not
be
compared
then
why
not
do
it
ask
your
readers
to
try
the
pleasure
of
giving
the
flowers
to
the
urchins
who
will
dog
their
steps
in
the
street
crying
with
hungry
voices
and
hungry
hearts
for
a
will
more
than
pay
for
the
trouble
it
will
brighten
the
office
the
store
or
the
schoolroom
all
through
the
day
let
them
have
no
fear
that
their
gift
will
not
be
appreciated
because
it
costs
nothing
not
alms
but
the
golden
rule
is
what
is
needed
in
the
tenements
of
the
poor
if
those
who
have
not
the
time
or
opportunity
themselves
will
send
their
flowers
to
mulberry
street
opposite
police
headquarters
it
will
be
done
for
them
the
summer
doctors
employed
by
the
health
department
to
canvass
the
tenements
in
july
and
august
will
gladly
cooperate
let
us
have
the
flowers
if
i
could
have
foreseen
the
result
i
hardly
think
that
last
paragraph
would
have
been
printed
i
meant
to
give
people
a
chance
to
discover
for
themselves
how
much
pleasure
they
could
get
out
of
a
little
thing
like
taking
an
armful
of
flowers
to
town
but
they
voted
unanimously
so
it
seemed
to
let
me
have
it
all
flowers
came
pouring
in
from
every
corner
of
the
compass
they
came
in
boxes
in
barrels
and
in
bunches
from
field
and
garden
from
town
and
country
carrying
flowers
jammed
mulberry
street
and
the
police
came
out
to
marvel
at
the
row
the
office
was
fairly
smothered
in
fragrance
a
howling
mob
of
children
besieged
it
the
reporters
forgot
their
rivalries
and
lent
a
hand
with
enthusiasm
in
giving
out
the
flowers
the
superintendent
of
police
detailed
five
stout
patrolmen
to
help
carry
the
abundance
to
points
of
convenient
distribution
wherever
we
went
fretful
babies
stopped
crying
and
smiled
as
the
messengers
of
love
were
laid
against
their
wan
cheeks
slovenly
women
courtesied
and
made
way
the
good
lord
bless
you
i
heard
as
i
passed
through
a
dark
hall
but
you
are
a
good
man
no
such
has
come
this
way
before
oh
the
heartache
of
it
and
yet
the
joy
the
italians
in
the
barracks
stopped
quarreling
to
help
keep
order
the
worst
street
became
suddenly
good
and
neighborly
a
year
or
two
after
father
john
tabb
priest
and
poet
wrote
upon
reading
my
statement
that
i
had
seen
an
armful
of
daisies
keep
the
peace
of
a
block
better
than
the
policeman
club
peacemakers
ye
the
daisies
from
the
soil
upbreathing
wordless
messages
of
love
soothing
of
brethren
the
toil
and
lifting
the
lowliest
above
ay
they
did
the
poet
knew
it
the
children
knew
it
the
slum
knew
it
it
lost
its
grip
where
the
flowers
went
with
their
message
i
saw
it
i
saw
too
that
i
had
put
my
hand
to
a
task
that
was
too
great
for
me
yet
which
i
might
not
give
over
once
i
had
taken
it
up
every
day
the
slum
showed
me
that
more
clearly
the
hunger
for
the
beautiful
that
gnawed
at
its
heart
was
a
constant
revelation
those
little
ones
at
home
were
wiser
than
i
at
most
i
had
made
out
its
stomach
this
was
like
cutting
windows
for
souls
that
were
being
shrunk
and
dwarfed
in
their
mean
setting
shut
them
up
once
the
sunlight
had
poured
in
never
i
could
only
drive
ahead
then
until
a
way
opened
somewhere
beyond
it
was
sure
to
do
that
and
it
did
among
the
boxes
from
somewhere
out
in
jersey
came
one
with
the
letters
on
i
paid
little
attention
to
it
then
but
when
more
came
so
marked
i
noticed
that
they
were
not
all
from
one
place
and
made
inquiries
as
to
what
the
letters
meant
so
i
was
led
to
the
king
daughters
headquarters
where
i
learned
that
they
stood
for
in
his
name
i
liked
the
sentiment
i
took
to
it
at
once
and
i
liked
the
silver
cross
upon
which
it
was
inscribed
i
sometimes
wish
i
had
lived
no
i
do
not
that
dreaming
i
have
lived
in
the
best
of
all
times
when
you
do
not
have
to
dream
things
good
but
can
help
make
them
so
all
the
same
when
i
put
on
the
old
crusader
cross
which
king
christian
sent
me
a
year
ago
from
denmark
and
think
of
the
valiant
knights
who
wore
it
i
feel
glad
and
proud
that
however
far
behind
i
may
ride
in
their
train
illustration
so
i
put
on
the
silver
cross
and
in
the
broadway
tabernacle
spoke
to
the
members
of
the
order
asking
them
to
make
this
work
theirs
they
did
it
at
once
a
committee
was
formed
and
in
the
summer
of
it
opened
an
office
in
the
basement
of
the
mariners
temple
down
in
the
fourth
ward
the
health
department
summer
doctors
were
enlisted
and
the
work
took
a
practical
turn
from
the
start
there
were
fifty
of
the
doctors
whose
duty
it
was
to
canvass
the
thirty
thousand
tenements
during
the
hot
season
and
prescribe
for
the
sick
poor
they
had
two
months
to
do
it
in
and
with
the
utmost
effort
if
they
were
to
cover
their
ground
could
only
get
around
once
to
each
family
in
a
great
many
cases
that
was
as
good
as
nothing
they
might
as
well
have
stayed
away
for
what
was
wanted
was
advice
instruction
a
friendly
lift
out
of
a
hopeless
rut
more
than
medicine
we
hired
a
nurse
and
where
they
pointed
there
she
went
following
their
track
and
bringing
the
things
the
doctor
could
not
give
it
worked
well
at
the
end
of
the
year
when
we
would
have
shut
up
shop
we
found
ourselves
with
three
hundred
families
on
our
hands
to
leave
whom
would
have
been
rank
treachery
so
we
took
a
couple
of
rooms
in
a
tenement
and
held
on
and
from
this
small
beginning
has
grown
the
king
daughters
settlement
which
occupies
two
houses
at
and
henry
street
doing
exactly
the
same
kind
of
work
as
when
they
began
in
the
next
block
the
flowers
were
and
are
the
open
sesame
to
every
home
they
wrere
laughed
at
by
some
at
the
start
but
that
was
because
they
did
not
know
they
are
not
needed
now
to
open
doors
the
little
cross
is
known
for
a
friend
wherever
it
goes
we
sometimes
hear
it
said
and
it
is
true
that
the
poor
are
more
charitable
among
themselves
than
the
outside
world
is
to
them
it
is
because
they
know
the
want
and
it
only
goes
to
prove
that
human
nature
is
at
bottom
good
not
bad
in
real
straits
it
comes
out
strongest
so
if
you
can
only
make
the
others
see
will
they
do
the
trouble
is
they
do
not
know
and
some
of
us
seem
to
have
cotton
in
our
ears
we
are
a
little
hard
of
hearing
yet
whenever
we
put
it
to
the
test
rang
true
i
remember
the
widow
with
three
or
four
little
ones
who
had
to
be
wheeled
if
she
were
to
be
able
to
get
about
as
the
doctor
insisted
there
was
no
nursery
within
reach
and
i
remember
the
procession
of
that
answered
our
appeal
it
strung
clear
across
the
street
into
chatham
square
whatever
we
needed
we
got
we
saw
the
great
heart
of
our
city
and
it
was
good
to
see
personally
i
had
little
to
do
with
it
except
to
form
the
link
with
the
official
end
of
it
the
summer
doctors
and
to
make
trouble
occasionally
as
for
instance
when
i
surreptitiously
supplied
an
old
couple
we
had
charge
of
with
plug
tobacco
the
ladies
took
it
ill
but
then
they
had
never
smoked
i
had
and
i
know
what
it
is
to
do
without
tobacco
for
the
doctor
cut
my
supply
off
a
long
while
ago
those
two
were
old
very
old
and
they
wanted
their
pipe
and
they
got
it
i
suppose
it
was
irregular
but
i
might
as
well
say
it
here
that
i
would
do
the
same
thing
again
without
doubt
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
so
little
have
i
profited
but
good
land
a
pipe
is
not
a
deadly
sin
for
the
rest
i
was
mighty
glad
to
see
things
managed
with
system
it
was
a
new
experience
to
me
on
the
i
had
a
kind
of
license
to
appeal
now
and
again
for
some
poor
family
i
had
come
across
and
sometimes
a
good
deal
of
money
came
in
it
was
hateful
to
find
that
it
did
not
always
do
the
good
it
ought
to
i
bring
to
mind
the
aged
bookkeeper
and
his
wife
whom
i
found
in
a
greene
street
attic
in
a
state
of
horrid
want
he
had
seen
much
better
days
and
it
was
altogether
a
very
pitiful
case
my
appeal
brought
in
over
which
in
my
delight
i
brought
him
in
a
lump
the
next
morning
when
going
home
at
three
whom
should
i
see
in
a
vile
chatham
street
dive
gloriously
drunk
and
in
the
clutches
of
a
gang
of
sixth
ward
cutthroats
but
my
protege
the
bookkeeper
squandering
money
right
and
left
i
caught
sight
of
him
through
the
open
door
and
in
hot
indignation
went
in
and
yanked
him
out
giving
him
a
good
talking
to
the
gang
followed
and
began
hostilities
at
once
but
for
the
providential
coming
of
two
policemen
we
should
probably
have
both
fared
ill
i
had
the
old
man
locked
up
in
the
oak
street
station
for
a
wonder
he
had
most
of
the
money
yet
and
thereafter
i
spent
it
for
him
on
another
occasion
we
were
deliberately
victimized
the
reporters
in
mulberry
street
i
mean
by
a
man
with
a
pitiful
story
of
hardship
which
we
took
as
truth
and
printed
when
i
got
around
there
the
next
morning
to
see
about
it
i
found
that
some
neighborhood
roughs
had
established
a
in
the
alley
charging
the
pitying
visitors
who
came
in
shoals
a
quarter
for
admission
to
the
show
in
the
garret
the
man
was
a
fraud
that
was
right
around
the
corner
from
a
place
where
years
before
i
used
to
drop
a
nickel
in
a
beggar
woman
hand
night
after
night
as
i
went
past
because
she
had
a
baby
cradled
on
her
wheezy
little
until
one
night
the
baby
rolled
into
the
gutter
and
i
saw
that
it
was
a
rag
baby
and
that
the
woman
was
drunk
it
was
on
such
evidence
as
this
both
as
to
them
and
myself
that
i
early
pinned
my
faith
to
organized
charity
as
just
orderly
charity
and
i
have
found
good
reasons
since
to
confirm
me
in
the
choice
if
any
doubt
had
lingered
in
my
mind
my
experience
in
helping
distribute
the
relief
fund
to
the
tornado
sufferers
at
woodhaven
a
dozen
years
ago
would
have
dispelled
it
it
does
seem
as
if
the
chance
of
getting
something
for
nothing
is
on
the
whole
the
greatest
temptation
one
can
hold
out
to
frail
human
nature
whether
in
the
slum
in
wall
street
or
out
where
the
daisies
grow
everything
takes
money
our
work
takes
a
good
deal
it
happened
more
than
once
when
the
bills
came
in
that
there
was
nothing
to
pay
them
with
now
these
were
times
to
put
to
the
test
my
faith
as
recorded
above
my
associates
in
the
board
will
bear
me
out
that
it
was
justified
it
is
true
that
the
strain
was
heavy
once
or
twice
i
recall
one
afternoon
as
do
they
when
we
sat
with
bills
amounting
to
before
us
and
not
a
cent
in
the
bank
so
the
treasurer
reported
even
as
she
did
the
brought
two
letters
both
from
the
same
town
as
it
happened
morristown
each
of
them
contained
a
check
for
one
from
a
happy
mother
in
gratitude
and
joy
the
other
from
one
stricken
by
a
great
sorrow
that
had
darkened
her
life
together
they
made
the
sum
needed
we
sat
and
looked
at
each
other
dumbly
to
me
it
was
not
strange
that
was
my
mother
faith
but
i
do
not
think
we
any
of
us
doubled
after
that
and
we
had
what
we
needed
as
we
needed
it
chapter
xii
i
become
an
author
and
resume
my
interrupted
career
as
a
lecturer
for
more
than
a
year
i
had
knocked
at
the
doors
of
the
various
magazine
editors
with
my
pictures
proposing
to
tell
them
how
the
other
half
lived
but
no
one
wanted
to
know
one
of
the
harpers
indeed
took
to
the
idea
but
the
editor
to
whom
he
sent
me
treated
me
very
cavalierly
hearing
that
i
had
taken
the
pictures
myself
he
proposed
to
buy
them
at
regular
photographer
rates
and
find
a
man
who
could
write
to
tell
the
story
we
did
not
part
with
mutual
expressions
of
esteem
i
gave
up
writing
for
a
time
then
and
tried
the
church
doors
that
which
was
bottled
up
within
me
was
perhaps
getting
a
trifle
too
hot
for
pen
and
ink
in
the
church
one
might
at
all
events
tell
the
truth
unhindered
so
i
thought
but
there
were
cautious
souls
there
too
who
held
the
doors
against
mulberry
street
and
the
police
reporter
it
was
fair
of
course
that
they
should
know
who
i
was
but
i
thought
it
sufficient
introduction
that
i
was
a
deacon
in
my
own
church
out
on
long
island
they
did
not
it
seemed
my
stock
of
patience
never
very
large
was
showing
signs
of
giving
out
and
i
retorted
hotly
that
then
if
they
wanted
to
know
i
was
a
reporter
and
perhaps
mulberry
street
had
as
much
sanctity
in
it
as
a
church
that
would
not
listen
to
its
wrongs
they
only
shut
the
doors
a
little
tighter
at
that
it
did
not
mend
matters
that
about
that
time
i
tried
a
little
in
my
own
fold
and
came
to
grief
it
did
not
prove
to
be
any
more
popular
on
long
island
than
in
new
york
i
resigned
the
diaconate
and
was
thinking
of
hiring
a
hall
a
theatre
could
be
had
on
sunday
wherein
to
preach
my
lay
sermon
when
i
came
across
schauffler
the
manager
of
the
city
mission
society
and
josiah
strong
the
author
of
our
country
they
happened
to
be
together
and
saw
at
once
the
bearing
of
my
pictures
remembering
my
early
experience
with
the
magic
lantern
i
had
had
slides
made
from
my
negatives
and
on
february
i
told
their
story
in
the
broadway
tabernacle
thereafter
things
mended
somewhat
plymouth
church
and
parkhurst
opened
their
doors
to
me
and
the
others
fell
slowly
into
line
i
had
my
say
and
felt
better
i
found
a
note
from
schauffler
among
my
papers
the
other
day
that
was
written
on
the
morning
after
that
first
speech
he
was
pleased
with
it
and
with
the
collection
of
for
the
mission
cause
i
remember
it
made
me
smile
a
little
grimly
the
fifty
cents
would
have
come
handy
for
lunch
that
day
it
just
happened
that
i
did
not
have
any
it
happened
quite
often
i
was
as
i
said
ever
a
bad
manager
i
mention
it
here
because
of
two
letters
that
came
while
i
have
been
writing
this
and
which
i
may
as
well
answer
now
one
asks
me
to
lift
the
mortgage
from
the
writer
home
i
get
a
good
many
of
that
kind
the
writers
seem
to
think
i
have
much
money
and
might
want
to
help
them
i
should
like
nothing
better
to
go
around
if
one
were
rich
and
pay
off
mortgages
on
little
homes
so
that
the
owners
when
they
had
got
the
interest
together
by
pinching
and
scraping
should
find
it
all
gone
and
paid
up
without
knowing
how
seems
to
me
must
be
the
very
finest
fun
in
all
the
world
but
i
shall
never
be
able
to
do
it
for
i
have
any
other
money
than
what
i
earn
with
my
pen
and
by
lecturing
and
never
had
so
their
appeals
only
make
me
poorer
by
a
stamp
for
an
answer
to
tell
them
that
and
make
them
no
richer
the
other
letter
asks
why
i
and
other
young
men
who
have
had
to
battle
with
the
world
did
not
go
to
the
young
christian
association
or
to
the
missionaries
for
help
i
do
not
know
about
the
others
but
i
did
not
want
anybody
to
help
me
there
were
plenty
that
were
worse
off
and
needed
help
more
the
only
time
i
tried
was
when
pater
breton
the
good
french
priest
in
buffalo
tried
to
get
me
across
to
france
to
fight
for
his
country
and
happily
did
not
succeed
as
to
battling
with
the
world
that
is
good
for
a
young
man
much
better
than
to
hang
on
to
somebody
for
support
a
little
starvation
once
in
a
while
even
is
not
out
of
the
way
we
eat
too
much
anyhow
and
when
you
have
fought
your
way
through
a
tight
place
you
are
the
better
for
it
i
am
afraid
that
is
not
always
the
case
when
you
have
been
shoved
through
and
then
again
as
i
have
just
told
when
i
did
go
to
the
ministers
with
a
fair
proposition
they
did
not
exactly
jump
at
it
no
it
was
better
the
way
it
was
the
thing
i
had
sought
vainly
so
long
came
in
the
end
by
another
road
than
i
planned
one
of
the
editors
of
saw
my
pictures
and
heard
their
story
in
his
church
and
came
to
talk
the
matter
over
with
me
as
a
result
of
that
talk
i
wrote
an
article
that
appeared
in
the
christmas
under
the
title
how
the
other
half
lives
and
made
an
instant
impression
that
was
the
beginning
of
better
days
before
i
let
the
old
depart
i
must
set
down
an
incident
of
my
reporter
experience
that
crowds
in
with
a
good
hearty
laugh
though
it
was
not
the
slum
that
sent
me
to
the
church
of
the
holy
communion
over
on
sixth
avenue
and
though
the
door
was
shut
in
my
face
it
was
not
by
the
rector
or
with
malice
prepense
a
despatch
from
the
tenderloin
police
station
had
it
that
the
wife
of
the
rev
henry
mottet
was
locked
up
there
out
of
her
mind
we
had
no
means
of
knowing
that
mottet
was
at
that
time
a
confirmed
bachelor
so
i
went
over
to
condole
with
him
and
incidentally
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
with
his
wife
any
way
the
servant
who
came
to
the
door
did
not
know
whether
the
doctor
was
in
she
would
go
and
see
but
even
as
she
said
it
the
wind
blew
the
door
shut
behind
her
it
had
a
oh
she
said
i
am
shut
out
if
the
doctor
is
in
the
house
i
ca
get
in
we
rang
but
no
one
came
there
was
only
one
way
to
try
the
windows
the
poor
girl
could
not
be
left
in
the
street
so
we
went
around
the
rectory
and
found
one
unlatched
she
gave
me
a
leg
up
and
i
raised
the
sash
and
crawled
in
halfway
in
the
room
with
one
leg
over
the
sill
i
became
dimly
conscious
of
a
shape
there
tall
and
expectant
it
stood
between
the
well
sir
and
who
are
you
it
spoke
sternly
i
climbed
over
the
sill
and
put
the
question
myself
and
who
are
you
sir
i
am
mottet
and
live
in
this
house
he
had
been
in
after
all
and
had
come
down
to
hear
what
the
ringing
was
about
and
now
may
i
ask
sir
certainly
you
may
i
am
a
reporter
from
police
headquarters
come
up
to
tell
you
that
your
wife
is
locked
up
in
the
thirtieth
street
police
station
the
doctor
looked
fixedly
at
me
for
a
full
minute
then
he
slowly
telescoped
his
tall
frame
into
an
armchair
and
sank
down
a
look
of
comic
despair
settling
upon
his
face
o
lord
he
sighed
heavily
a
strange
man
climbs
through
my
parlor
window
to
tell
me
a
bachelor
that
my
wife
is
locked
up
in
the
police
station
what
will
happen
next
and
then
we
laughed
together
and
made
friends
the
woman
was
just
an
ordinary
lunatic
i
was
late
home
from
the
office
one
evening
the
week
my
christmas
article
was
printed
my
wife
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
door
looking
down
the
street
i
saw
that
she
had
something
on
her
mind
but
the
children
were
all
right
she
said
nothing
was
amiss
supper
over
she
drew
a
chair
to
the
fire
and
brought
out
a
letter
i
read
it
she
nodded
it
was
our
way
the
commonest
business
letter
is
to
me
a
human
document
when
she
has
read
it
besides
she
knows
so
much
more
than
i
her
heart
can
find
a
way
where
my
head
bucks
blindly
against
stone
walls
the
letter
was
from
jeanette
gilder
of
the
asking
if
i
had
thought
of
making
my
article
into
a
book
if
so
she
knew
a
publisher
my
chance
had
come
i
was
at
last
to
have
my
say
i
should
have
thought
i
would
have
shouted
and
carried
on
i
did
we
sat
looking
into
the
fire
together
she
and
i
neither
of
us
spoke
then
we
went
up
to
the
children
they
slept
sweetly
in
their
cribs
i
saw
a
tear
in
her
eye
as
she
bent
over
the
cradle
and
caught
her
to
me
questioning
shall
we
lose
you
now
she
whispered
and
hid
her
head
on
my
shoulder
i
do
not
know
what
jealous
thought
of
authors
being
wedded
to
their
work
had
come
into
her
mind
or
rather
i
do
i
felt
it
and
in
my
heart
while
i
held
her
close
i
registered
a
vow
which
i
have
kept
it
was
the
last
tear
she
shed
for
me
our
daughter
pouts
at
her
father
now
and
then
says
i
am
fierce
but
she
comes
with
her
sewing
to
sit
where
i
write
and
when
she
comes
the
sun
shines
necessarily
for
a
while
my
new
work
held
me
very
close
how
the
other
half
lives
was
written
at
night
while
the
house
slept
for
i
had
my
office
work
to
attend
to
in
the
day
then
it
was
my
habit
to
light
the
lamps
in
all
the
rooms
of
the
lower
story
and
roam
through
them
with
my
pipe
for
i
do
most
of
my
writing
on
my
feet
i
began
the
book
with
the
new
year
in
november
it
was
published
and
on
the
day
it
came
out
i
joined
the
staff
of
the
i
merely
moved
up
one
flight
of
stairs
mulberry
street
was
not
done
with
me
yet
nor
i
with
it
i
had
had
a
falling
out
with
the
manager
of
the
associated
press
bureau
the
had
retired
from
the
copartnership
some
years
before
and
during
one
brief
summer
ran
an
opposition
shop
of
my
own
i
sold
police
news
to
all
the
papers
and
they
fell
away
from
the
bureau
with
such
hearty
unanimity
that
the
manager
came
around
and
offered
to
farm
out
the
department
to
me
entirely
if
i
would
join
forces
but
independence
was
ever
sweet
to
me
and
in
this
instance
it
proved
profitable
even
i
made
at
least
three
times
as
much
money
as
before
but
i
did
it
at
such
cost
of
energy
and
effort
that
i
soon
found
it
could
not
last
even
with
the
phenomenal
streak
of
good
luck
i
had
struck
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
only
to
reach
out
to
turn
up
news
i
hear
people
saying
once
in
a
while
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
luck
they
are
wrong
there
is
i
know
it
it
runs
in
streaks
like
accidents
and
fires
the
thing
is
to
get
in
the
way
of
it
and
keep
there
till
it
comes
along
then
hitch
on
and
away
you
go
it
is
the
old
story
of
the
early
bird
i
got
up
at
five
three
hours
before
any
of
my
competitors
and
sometimes
they
came
down
to
the
office
to
find
my
news
hawked
about
the
street
in
extras
of
their
own
papers
one
way
or
another
a
fight
there
was
always
on
hand
that
seemed
foreordained
if
it
was
not
the
opposition
it
was
the
police
when
mulberry
street
took
a
rest
the
publisher
reader
began
it
and
the
this
last
is
an
enemy
of
human
kind
anyhow
not
only
that
he
makes
you
say
things
you
never
dreamed
of
but
his
being
so
cocksure
that
he
knows
better
every
time
is
a
direct
challenge
to
a
fight
the
reader
is
tarred
with
the
same
stick
he
is
the
one
who
passes
on
the
manuscript
and
he
has
an
ingrown
hatred
of
opinion
if
a
man
has
that
he
is
his
enemy
before
he
ever
sets
eye
on
him
he
passed
on
my
manuscript
with
a
blue
pencil
that
laid
waste
whole
pages
once
a
whole
chapter
with
a
stroke
it
was
like
sacking
a
conquered
city
but
he
did
not
die
in
his
sins
i
joined
battle
at
the
first
sight
of
that
blue
pencil
the
publishers
said
their
reader
was
a
very
capable
man
so
he
was
and
a
fine
fellow
to
boot
had
forgotten
more
than
i
ever
knew
except
as
to
the
other
half
of
which
he
did
not
know
anything
i
suggested
to
the
firm
that
if
they
did
not
think
so
they
had
better
let
him
write
a
book
to
suit
or
else
print
mine
as
i
wrote
it
it
was
fair
and
they
took
my
view
of
it
so
did
he
the
blue
pencil
went
out
of
commission
how
deadly
tired
i
was
in
those
days
i
do
not
think
i
myself
knew
until
i
went
to
boston
one
evening
to
help
discuss
sweating
at
the
institute
of
technology
i
had
an
hour
to
spare
and
went
around
into
beacon
street
to
call
upon
a
friend
i
walked
mechanically
up
the
stoop
and
rang
the
bell
my
friend
was
not
in
said
the
servant
who
came
to
the
door
who
should
she
say
called
i
stood
and
looked
at
her
like
a
fool
i
had
forgotten
my
name
i
was
not
asleep
i
was
rummaging
in
an
agony
of
dread
and
excitement
through
every
corner
and
crevice
of
my
brain
for
my
own
name
but
i
did
not
find
it
as
slowly
as
i
could
to
gain
time
i
reached
for
my
and
fumbled
for
a
card
hoping
to
remember
but
no
ray
came
until
i
actually
read
my
name
on
my
card
it
was
as
utterly
gone
as
if
i
had
never
heard
it
if
the
people
of
boston
got
anything
out
of
my
speech
that
day
they
did
better
than
i
all
the
time
i
spoke
something
kept
saying
over
within
me
you
are
a
nice
fellow
to
make
a
speech
at
the
institute
of
technology
you
do
even
know
your
own
name
after
that
i
was
haunted
by
a
feeling
that
i
would
lose
myself
altogether
and
got
into
the
habit
of
leaving
private
directions
in
the
office
where
i
would
probably
be
found
should
question
arise
it
arose
at
last
in
a
brooklyn
church
where
i
was
making
a
speech
with
my
pictures
while
i
spoke
a
feeling
kept
growing
upon
me
that
i
ought
to
be
down
in
the
audience
looking
at
the
pictures
it
all
seemed
a
long
way
off
and
in
no
way
related
to
me
before
i
knew
it
or
any
one
had
time
to
notice
i
had
gone
down
and
taken
a
front
seat
i
sat
there
for
as
much
as
five
minutes
perhaps
while
the
man
with
the
lantern
fidgeted
and
the
audience
wondered
i
suppose
what
was
coming
next
then
it
was
the
pictures
that
did
not
change
which
fretted
me
with
a
cold
chill
i
knew
i
had
been
lost
and
went
back
and
finished
the
speech
no
one
was
any
the
wiser
apparently
but
i
was
glad
when
the
following
week
i
wrote
the
last
page
in
my
book
that
night
my
wife
insists
i
deliberately
turned
a
somersault
on
the
parlor
carpet
while
the
big
children
cheered
and
the
baby
looked
on
from
her
high
chair
i
preserve
among
my
cherished
treasures
two
letters
of
that
period
from
james
russell
lowell
in
one
of
them
he
gives
me
permission
to
use
the
verses
with
which
i
prefaced
the
book
they
were
the
text
from
which
i
preached
my
sermon
he
writes
that
he
is
glad
they
have
so
much
life
left
in
them
after
forty
years
but
those
verses
will
never
die
they
tell
in
a
few
lines
all
i
tried
to
tell
on
three
hundred
pages
the
other
letter
was
written
when
he
had
read
the
book
i
reproduce
it
here
illustration
lowell
letter
for
myself
i
have
never
been
able
to
satisfactorily
explain
the
great
run
how
the
other
half
lives
had
it
is
a
curiously
popular
book
even
perhaps
it
was
that
i
had
had
it
in
me
so
long
that
it
burst
out
at
last
with
a
rush
that
caught
on
the
title
had
a
deal
to
do
with
it
howells
asked
me
once
where
i
got
it
i
did
not
get
it
it
came
of
itself
like
topsy
it
growed
it
had
run
in
my
mind
ever
since
i
thought
of
the
things
i
tried
to
describe
then
there
was
the
piece
of
real
good
luck
that
booth
in
darkest
england
was
published
just
then
people
naturally
asked
how
about
new
york
that
winter
ward
mcallister
wrote
his
book
about
society
as
he
had
found
it
and
the
circuit
was
made
ministers
preached
about
the
contrast
how
the
other
half
lives
ran
from
edition
to
edition
there
was
speedily
a
demand
for
more
copy
and
i
wrote
the
children
of
the
poor
following
the
same
track
critics
said
there
were
more
bones
in
it
but
it
was
never
popular
like
the
other
half
by
bones
i
suppose
they
meant
facts
to
tie
to
they
were
scarce
enough
at
that
stage
of
the
inquiry
i
have
in
my
desk
a
table
giving
the
ages
at
which
children
get
their
teeth
that
bears
witness
to
that
i
had
been
struggling
with
the
problem
of
in
some
east
side
factories
and
was
not
making
any
headway
the
children
had
certificates
one
and
all
declaring
them
to
be
fourteen
and
therefore
fit
to
be
employed
it
was
perfectly
evident
that
they
were
not
ten
in
scores
of
cases
but
the
employer
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
pointed
to
the
certificate
the
father
usually
a
tailor
would
not
listen
at
all
but
went
right
on
ironing
there
was
no
birth
registry
to
fall
back
on
that
end
of
it
was
neglected
there
seemed
to
be
no
way
of
proving
the
fact
yet
the
fact
was
there
and
must
be
proven
my
own
children
were
teething
at
the
time
and
it
gave
me
an
idea
i
got
tracy
to
write
out
that
table
for
me
showing
at
what
age
the
should
appear
when
the
molars
etc
armed
with
that
i
went
into
the
factories
and
pried
open
the
little
workers
mouths
the
girls
objected
their
teeth
were
quite
generally
bad
but
i
saw
enough
to
enable
me
to
speak
positively
even
allowing
for
the
backwardness
of
the
slum
it
was
clear
that
a
child
that
had
not
yet
grown
its
was
not
fourteen
for
they
should
have
been
cut
at
twelve
at
the
latest
three
years
later
the
reinhardt
committee
reported
to
the
legislature
that
the
net
result
of
the
factory
law
was
a
mass
of
perjury
and
and
day
began
to
dawn
for
the
little
ones
too
rough
ways
and
rough
work
yes
but
you
must
use
the
tools
that
come
to
hand
and
be
glad
for
them
if
you
want
to
get
things
done
bludgeons
were
needed
just
then
and
after
all
you
can
get
a
good
deal
of
fun
out
of
one
when
it
is
needed
i
know
i
did
by
that
time
the
whole
battle
with
the
slum
had
evolved
itself
out
of
the
effort
to
clean
one
and
as
for
my
own
share
in
it
to
settle
for
one
dead
dog
it
was
raging
all
along
the
line
with
demands
for
reform
and
the
destruction
of
the
old
rookeries
for
parks
for
the
people
who
were
penned
up
in
the
slum
for
playgrounds
for
their
children
for
decent
teaching
and
decent
schools
there
were
too
many
dark
spots
in
new
york
where
we
had
neither
so
dense
was
the
ignorance
of
the
ruling
powers
of
the
needs
and
real
condition
of
the
public
schools
which
on
parade
days
they
spoke
of
sententiously
as
the
of
our
liberties
while
the
people
cheered
the
sentiment
that
it
was
related
how
a
tammany
mayor
had
appointed
to
the
office
of
school
trustee
in
the
third
ward
a
man
who
had
been
dead
a
whole
year
and
how
when
the
world
marvelled
it
had
been
laughed
off
at
the
city
hall
with
the
comment
that
what
did
it
matter
there
were
no
schools
in
the
ward
it
was
the
wholesale
grocery
district
i
do
not
know
how
true
it
was
but
there
was
no
reason
why
it
might
not
be
it
was
exactly
on
a
par
with
the
rest
of
it
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
there
were
no
good
schools
in
new
york
there
were
some
as
good
as
anywhere
for
there
were
teachers
who
redeemed
even
the
slough
we
were
in
from
utter
despair
but
they
were
there
in
spite
of
it
and
they
were
far
from
being
the
rule
let
us
hope
for
the
day
when
that
shall
have
been
reversed
as
a
statement
of
fact
no
one
will
hail
it
more
gladly
than
i
there
is
an
easy
way
of
putting
it
to
the
test
we
did
it
once
before
broach
a
measure
of
school
reform
and
see
what
the
question
is
that
will
be
asked
by
the
teachers
if
it
is
how
is
it
going
to
benefit
the
children
hoist
the
flag
the
day
of
deliverance
is
at
hand
in
the
battle
i
refer
to
that
question
was
not
asked
once
the
teachers
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
for
rights
let
the
children
fare
as
they
might
however
that
is
an
old
grievance
we
had
it
out
over
it
once
and
i
have
no
mind
to
rip
it
up
again
unless
it
is
needed
my
own
father
was
a
teacher
perhaps
that
is
one
reason
why
i
revere
the
calling
so
that
i
would
keep
its
skirts
clear
of
politics
at
any
hazard
another
is
that
i
most
heartily
subscribe
to
the
statement
that
the
public
school
is
the
of
our
liberties
and
to
the
sentiment
that
would
keep
the
flag
flying
over
it
always
only
i
want
as
much
respect
for
the
flag
a
clean
school
under
an
unsoiled
flag
so
we
shall
pull
through
not
otherwise
the
thing
requires
no
argument
illustration
the
boys
playground
in
an
school
my
own
effort
in
that
fight
was
mainly
for
decent
schoolhouses
for
playgrounds
and
for
a
truant
school
to
keep
the
boys
out
of
jail
if
i
was
not
competent
to
argue
over
the
curriculum
with
a
professor
of
pedagogy
i
could
tell
at
least
if
a
schoolroom
was
so
jammed
that
to
let
me
pass
into
the
next
room
the
children
in
the
front
seat
had
to
rise
and
stand
or
if
there
was
light
enough
for
them
to
see
their
slates
or
the
blackboard
nor
did
it
take
the
wisdom
of
a
solomon
to
decide
that
a
dark
basement
room
thirty
by
fifty
feet
full
of
rats
was
not
a
proper
place
for
a
thousand
children
to
call
their
only
playground
play
in
the
kindergarten
scheme
is
the
normal
occupation
of
the
child
through
which
he
first
begins
to
perceive
moral
relations
nice
kind
of
morals
burrowed
there
for
him
there
was
in
the
whole
of
manhattan
but
a
single
outdoor
playground
attached
to
a
public
school
and
that
was
an
old
in
first
street
that
had
been
wrested
from
the
dead
with
immense
toil
when
i
had
fed
fat
my
grudge
upon
these
things
i
could
still
go
where
the
public
school
children
came
and
learn
by
a
little
judicious
pumping
how
my
friend
the
professor
had
stored
their
minds
that
is
if
they
did
not
come
to
me
many
hundreds
of
them
did
when
under
roosevelt
we
needed
two
thousand
new
policemen
and
it
was
from
some
of
them
we
learned
that
among
the
thirteen
states
which
formed
the
union
were
england
ireland
wales
belfast
and
cork
that
abraham
lincoln
was
murdered
by
ballington
booth
and
that
the
fire
department
was
in
charge
of
the
city
government
when
the
mayor
was
away
do
i
wish
it
were
and
that
they
would
turn
the
hose
on
a
while
what
a
lot
of
trouble
it
would
save
us
in
november
as
for
a
truant
school
the
lack
of
one
was
the
worst
outrage
of
all
for
it
compelled
the
sending
of
boys
who
had
done
no
worse
harm
than
to
play
hooky
on
a
sunny
spring
day
to
a
jail
with
iron
bars
in
the
windows
for
the
boy
who
did
this
wicked
thing
let
me
be
plain
about
it
and
say
that
if
he
had
not
if
he
had
patiently
preferred
some
of
the
schools
i
knew
to
a
day
of
freedom
out
in
the
sunshine
i
should
have
thought
him
a
miserable
little
lunkhead
quite
beyond
hope
as
for
those
who
locked
him
up
almost
nothing
i
can
think
of
would
be
bad
enough
for
them
the
whole
effort
of
society
should
be
and
is
getting
to
be
more
and
more
thank
goodness
and
common
sense
to
keep
the
boy
out
of
jail
to
run
to
it
with
him
the
moment
the
sap
begins
to
boil
up
in
him
and
he
does
any
one
of
the
thousand
things
we
have
all
done
or
wanted
to
do
if
we
dared
why
it
is
sinful
folly
i
am
not
saying
that
there
are
not
boys
who
ought
to
be
in
jail
though
to
my
mind
it
is
the
poorest
use
you
can
put
them
to
but
to
put
truants
there
to
learn
all
the
tricks
the
jail
has
to
teach
with
them
in
the
frame
of
mind
in
which
it
receives
them
for
boys
are
not
fools
whatever
those
who
are
set
over
them
may
be
and
they
know
when
they
are
i
know
of
nothing
so
wickedly
wasteful
that
was
our
way
is
still
in
fact
to
a
large
extent
though
the
principle
has
been
disavowed
as
both
foul
and
foolish
but
in
those
days
the
defenders
of
the
system
heaven
save
the
mark
fought
for
it
yet
and
it
was
give
and
take
right
along
every
day
and
all
day
before
this
in
time
to
bear
a
strong
hand
in
it
all
there
had
come
into
the
field
a
new
force
that
was
destined
to
give
both
energy
and
direction
to
our
scattered
efforts
for
reform
up
till
then
we
had
been
a
band
of
guerillas
the
incentive
proceeding
usually
from
felix
adler
josephine
shaw
lowell
or
some
one
of
their
stamp
and
the
rest
of
us
joining
in
to
push
cart
up
the
hill
then
taking
time
to
breathe
until
another
came
along
that
needed
a
lift
the
social
settlements
starting
as
neighborhood
guilds
to
reassert
the
lost
brotherhood
became
almost
from
the
first
the
fulcrum
as
it
were
whence
the
lever
for
reform
was
applied
because
the
whole
idea
of
that
reform
was
to
better
the
lot
of
those
whom
the
prosperous
knew
vaguely
only
as
the
poor
if
parks
were
wanted
if
schools
needed
bettering
there
were
at
the
college
settlement
the
university
settlement
the
nurses
settlement
and
at
a
score
of
other
such
places
young
enthusiasts
to
collect
the
facts
and
to
urge
them
with
the
prestige
of
their
organization
to
back
them
the
hull
house
out
in
chicago
set
the
pace
and
it
was
kept
up
bravely
at
this
end
of
the
line
for
one
i
attached
myself
as
a
kind
of
volunteer
auxiliary
to
the
college
settlement
that
was
what
the
girls
there
called
me
and
to
any
one
that
would
have
me
and
so
in
a
few
years
time
slid
easily
into
the
day
when
my
ruder
methods
were
quite
out
of
date
and
ready
to
be
shelved
how
it
came
about
that
almost
before
i
knew
it
my
tongue
was
enlisted
in
the
fight
as
well
as
my
pen
i
do
not
know
myself
it
could
not
be
because
i
had
a
for
i
read
in
the
local
newspaper
one
day
when
i
had
been
lecturing
in
the
western
part
of
the
state
that
a
voluble
german
with
a
voice
like
a
squeaky
had
been
in
town
it
seems
that
i
had
fallen
into
another
newspaper
row
all
unsuspecting
and
was
in
the
opposition
editor
camp
but
truly
i
lay
no
claim
to
eloquence
so
it
must
have
been
the
facts
again
there
is
nothing
like
them
whatever
it
was
it
made
me
smile
sometimes
in
the
middle
of
a
speech
to
think
of
the
prophecies
when
i
was
a
schoolboy
that
my
tongue
would
be
my
undoing
for
here
it
was
helping
right
wrongs
instead
in
fact
that
was
what
it
had
tried
to
do
in
the
old
days
when
the
teachers
were
tyrannical
it
entered
the
lists
here
when
will
craig
a
clerk
in
the
health
department
with
whom
i
had
struck
up
a
friendship
helped
me
turn
my
photographs
into
slides
by
paying
the
bills
and
grew
from
that
until
now
my
winters
are
spent
on
the
lecture
platform
altogether
i
always
liked
the
work
it
tires
less
than
the
office
routine
and
you
feel
the
touch
with
your
fellows
more
than
when
you
sit
and
write
your
message
also
if
you
wish
to
learn
about
a
thing
the
best
way
is
always
to
go
and
try
to
teach
some
one
else
that
thing
i
never
make
a
speech
on
a
subject
i
am
familiar
with
but
that
i
come
away
knowing
more
about
it
than
i
did
at
the
start
though
no
one
else
may
have
said
a
word
then
there
is
the
chairman
you
never
can
tell
what
sort
of
surprise
is
in
store
for
you
in
a
massachusetts
town
last
winter
i
was
hailed
on
the
stage
by
one
of
his
tribe
a
gaunt
funereal
sort
of
man
who
wanted
to
know
what
he
should
say
about
me
oh
said
i
in
a
spirit
of
levity
say
anything
you
like
say
i
am
the
most
distinguished
citizen
in
the
country
they
generally
do
whereupon
my
funereal
friend
marched
upon
the
stage
and
calmly
announced
to
the
audience
that
he
did
not
know
this
man
riis
whom
he
was
charged
with
introducing
never
heard
of
him
he
tells
me
he
went
on
with
never
a
wink
that
he
is
the
most
distinguished
citizen
in
the
country
you
can
judge
for
yourselves
when
you
have
heard
him
i
thought
at
first
it
was
some
bad
kind
of
joke
but
no
he
was
not
that
kind
of
man
i
do
not
suppose
he
had
smiled
since
he
was
born
maybe
he
was
an
undertaker
assuredly
he
ought
to
be
but
he
had
bowels
after
all
instead
of
going
off
the
stage
and
leaving
me
blue
with
rage
he
stayed
to
exhort
the
audience
in
a
fifteen
minutes
speech
to
vote
right
or
something
of
that
sort
the
single
remark
when
at
last
he
turned
his
back
that
it
was
a
relief
to
have
him
extinguished
made
us
men
and
brothers
that
audience
and
me
i
think
of
him
with
almost
as
much
pleasure
as
i
do
of
that
city
editor
chap
out
in
illinois
who
came
blowing
upon
the
platform
at
the
last
minute
and
handed
me
a
typewritten
speech
with
the
question
if
that
would
do
i
read
it
over
it
began
with
the
statement
that
it
was
the
general
impression
that
all
newspapermen
were
liars
and
went
on
by
easy
stages
to
point
out
that
there
were
exceptions
myself
for
instance
the
rest
was
a
lot
of
praise
to
which
i
had
no
claim
i
said
so
and
that
i
wished
he
would
leave
it
out
oh
well
he
said
with
a
happy
smile
do
you
see
it
gives
you
your
cue
then
you
can
turn
around
and
say
that
anyway
i
am
a
liar
with
tongue
or
pen
the
argument
shaped
itself
finally
into
the
fundamental
one
for
the
rescue
of
the
home
imperiled
by
the
slum
there
all
roads
met
good
citizenship
hung
upon
that
issue
say
what
you
will
a
man
can
not
live
like
a
pig
and
vote
like
a
man
the
dullest
of
us
saw
it
the
tenement
had
given
to
new
york
the
name
of
the
homeless
city
but
with
that
gone
which
made
life
worth
living
what
were
liberty
worth
with
no
home
to
cherish
how
long
before
love
of
country
would
be
an
empty
sound
life
liberty
pursuit
of
happiness
wind
says
the
slum
and
the
slum
is
right
if
we
let
it
be
we
can
not
get
rid
of
the
tenements
that
shelter
two
million
souls
in
new
york
but
we
set
about
making
them
at
least
as
nearly
fit
to
harbor
human
souls
as
might
be
that
will
take
a
long
time
yet
but
a
beginning
was
made
with
reform
looming
upon
the
heels
of
the
lexow
disclosures
came
the
gilder
commission
in
the
autumn
of
picture
of
an
entitled
typical
east
side
tenement
block
subtitled
five
hundred
babies
in
it
not
one
bathtub
greater
work
was
never
done
for
new
york
than
by
that
faithful
body
of
men
the
measure
of
it
is
not
to
be
found
in
what
was
actually
accomplished
though
the
volume
of
that
was
great
but
in
what
it
made
possible
upon
the
foundations
they
laid
down
we
may
build
for
all
time
and
be
the
better
for
it
light
and
air
acquired
a
legal
claim
and
where
the
sun
shines
into
the
slum
the
slum
is
doomed
the
worst
tenements
were
destroyed
parks
were
opened
schools
built
playgrounds
made
the
children
rights
were
won
back
for
them
the
slum
denied
them
even
the
chance
to
live
for
it
was
shown
that
the
worst
rear
tenements
murdered
the
babies
at
the
rate
of
one
in
five
the
commission
made
it
clear
that
the
legislation
that
was
needed
was
the
kind
that
would
root
out
every
old
ramshackle
tenement
in
the
city
that
was
the
way
to
begin
it
as
to
the
rest
of
them
it
laid
the
foundation
deeper
yet
for
it
made
us
see
that
life
in
them
conduces
to
the
corruption
of
the
young
that
told
it
all
it
meant
that
a
mortgage
was
put
on
the
civic
life
of
the
morrow
which
was
not
to
be
borne
we
were
forewarned
the
corruption
of
the
young
we
move
with
rapid
strides
in
our
time
that
which
was
a
threat
scoffed
at
by
many
has
become
a
present
and
dreadful
peril
in
half
a
dozen
brief
years
we
took
a
short
cut
to
make
it
that
when
we
tried
to
drain
the
pool
of
police
blackmail
of
which
the
lexow
disclosures
had
shown
us
the
hideous
depths
we
drained
it
into
the
tenements
and
for
the
police
infamy
got
a
blackmail
that
is
worse
the
chairman
of
the
committee
of
fifteen
tells
us
that
of
more
than
a
hundred
tenements
full
of
growing
children
which
his
committee
has
canvassed
not
one
had
escaped
the
contamination
that
piles
up
the
landlord
profits
twelve
dollars
for
an
honest
flat
thirty
for
the
other
kind
and
no
questions
asked
i
find
in
my
this
warning
sounded
by
me
in
the
christmas
holidays
when
the
country
was
ringing
with
parkhurst
name
i
would
not
whatever
else
might
happen
by
any
hasty
or
system
of
wholesale
raids
crowd
these
women
into
the
tenements
and
flats
of
our
city
that
is
what
will
surely
happen
is
happening
now
it
is
a
danger
infinitely
greater
than
any
flowing
from
their
presence
where
they
are
and
as
they
are
each
centre
of
moral
contagion
by
this
scattering
process
becomes
ten
or
twenty
planted
where
they
will
do
the
most
possible
harm
think
of
the
children
brought
in
daily
hourly
contact
with
this
vice
think
of
the
thousands
of
young
women
looking
vainly
for
work
this
hard
winter
be
there
ever
so
little
money
for
woman
honest
work
there
is
always
enough
to
buy
her
virtue
have
tenement
houses
moral
resources
that
can
be
trusted
to
keep
her
safe
from
this
temptation
this
is
a
wicked
villany
that
must
not
be
permitted
come
whatever
else
may
we
hear
of
danger
to
young
men
from
present
conditions
what
sort
of
young
men
must
they
be
who
would
risk
the
sacrifice
of
their
poorer
sisters
for
their
own
and
it
is
being
risked
wherever
houses
of
this
kind
are
being
shut
up
and
the
women
turned
into
the
streets
there
to
shift
for
themselves
the
jail
does
not
keep
them
christian
families
will
not
receive
them
they
can
not
be
killed
no
door
opens
to
them
yet
they
have
to
go
somewhere
and
they
go
where
they
think
they
can
hide
from
the
police
and
still
ply
the
trade
that
gives
them
the
only
living
society
is
willing
they
shall
have
though
it
says
it
is
not
and
they
did
go
there
parkhurst
was
not
to
blame
he
was
fighting
tammany
that
dealt
the
cards
and
took
all
the
tricks
and
for
that
fight
new
york
owes
him
a
debt
it
hardly
yet
knows
of
besides
though
those
raids
hastened
the
process
it
was
already
well
underway
the
police
extortion
of
itself
would
have
finished
it
in
time
a
blackmailer
in
the
long
run
always
kills
the
goose
that
lays
his
golden
egg
his
greed
gets
the
better
of
his
sense
the
interview
i
quoted
was
not
a
plea
for
legalizing
wrong
that
will
get
us
no
farther
it
was
rather
a
summons
to
our
people
to
cease
skulking
behind
lying
phrases
and
look
the
matter
squarely
in
the
face
with
a
law
passed
this
winter
which
sends
the
woman
to
jail
and
fines
the
landlord
and
his
house
we
shall
be
in
the
way
shortly
of
doing
so
until
we
do
that
justice
first
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
poverty
back
is
burdened
enough
without
our
loading
upon
it
the
sins
we
are
afraid
to
face
meanwhile
we
shall
be
getting
up
courage
to
talk
plainly
about
it
which
is
half
the
battle
think
of
the
shock
it
would
have
given
our
grandmothers
to
hear
of
a
meeting
of
women
in
a
public
hall
to
protest
against
protected
vice
on
a
sunday
too
come
to
think
of
it
i
do
not
know
but
that
wholesome
plain
speech
on
this
subject
is
nearer
the
whole
than
half
the
battle
i
rather
guess
it
is
chapter
xiii
roosevelt
comes
mulberry
street
golden
age
see
now
how
things
fall
out
hardly
had
i
sent
the
chapter
to
the
printer
in
which
i
posted
proofreaders
as
enemies
of
mankind
when
here
comes
the
proof
of
the
previous
one
with
a
cordial
note
of
thanks
from
this
particular
enemy
for
the
inspiration
he
found
in
it
so
then
i
was
mistaken
as
i
have
been
often
before
and
owe
him
the
confession
good
land
what
are
we
that
we
should
think
ourselves
always
right
or
lest
we
do
wrong
sit
idle
all
our
lives
waiting
for
light
the
light
comes
as
we
work
toward
it
roosevelt
was
right
when
he
said
that
the
only
one
who
never
makes
mistakes
is
the
one
who
never
does
anything
preserve
us
from
him
from
the
man
who
eternally
wants
to
hold
the
scales
even
and
so
never
gets
done
weighing
never
hands
anything
over
the
counter
take
him
away
and
put
red
blood
into
his
veins
and
let
the
rest
of
us
go
ahead
and
make
our
mistakes
as
few
as
we
can
as
many
as
we
must
only
let
us
go
ahead
all
of
which
has
reference
to
other
things
i
have
in
mind
not
to
the
against
whom
i
have
no
grudge
as
for
him
perhaps
he
is
just
a
sign
that
the
world
moves
move
it
did
at
last
in
the
year
that
gave
us
the
lexow
investigating
committee
the
citizens
seventy
and
reform
tammany
went
out
speeded
on
its
way
by
parkhurst
and
an
administration
came
in
that
was
pledged
to
all
we
had
been
longing
and
laboring
for
for
three
years
we
had
free
hands
and
we
used
them
mayor
strong
administration
was
not
the
millennium
but
it
brought
new
york
much
nearer
to
it
than
it
had
ever
been
and
it
set
up
some
standards
toward
which
we
may
keep
on
striving
with
profit
to
ourselves
the
mayor
himself
was
not
a
saint
he
was
an
honest
gentleman
of
sturdy
purpose
to
do
the
right
and
normally
of
singular
practical
wisdom
in
choosing
the
men
to
help
him
do
it
but
with
an
intermittent
delusion
that
he
was
a
shrewd
politician
when
it
came
uppermost
he
made
bargains
and
appointed
men
to
office
who
did
their
worst
to
undo
what
good
the
warings
the
roosevelts
and
their
kind
had
wrought
in
the
struggle
that
ensued
mayor
strong
was
always
on
the
side
of
right
but
when
he
wanted
most
to
help
he
could
not
it
is
the
way
of
the
world
nevertheless
as
i
said
it
moved
how
far
we
came
is
history
plain
to
read
in
our
streets
that
will
never
again
be
as
dirty
as
they
were
though
they
may
not
be
as
clean
as
waring
left
them
in
the
threescore
splendid
new
that
stand
as
monuments
of
those
busy
years
in
the
open
spots
that
let
the
sunlight
into
the
slum
where
it
was
darkest
and
most
foul
in
the
death
rate
that
came
down
from
per
thousand
of
the
living
in
to
in
that
was
the
ten
years
war
footnote
now
the
battle
with
the
slum
i
wrote
about
and
have
here
before
referred
to
the
three
years
of
the
strong
administration
saw
all
the
big
battles
in
which
we
beat
the
slum
i
am
not
going
to
rehearse
them
for
i
am
trying
to
tell
my
own
story
and
now
i
am
soon
done
with
it
i
carried
a
gun
as
a
volunteer
in
that
war
and
that
was
all
not
even
in
the
ranks
at
that
i
was
ever
an
irregular
given
to
sniping
on
my
own
hook
roosevelt
indeed
wanted
me
to
have
a
seat
among
mayor
strong
official
advisers
but
we
had
it
out
over
that
when
he
told
me
of
it
and
the
compact
we
made
that
he
should
never
ask
that
service
of
me
he
has
kept
so
he
spared
the
mayor
much
embarrassment
for
as
i
said
i
am
not
good
in
the
ranks
more
is
the
pity
and
me
he
saved
for
such
use
as
i
could
be
of
which
was
well
for
shortly
it
all
centred
in
mulberry
street
where
he
was
we
were
not
strangers
it
could
not
have
been
long
after
i
wrote
how
the
other
half
lives
that
he
came
to
the
office
one
day
looking
for
me
i
was
out
and
he
left
his
card
merely
writing
on
the
back
of
it
that
he
had
read
my
book
and
had
come
to
help
that
was
all
and
it
tells
the
whole
story
of
the
man
i
loved
him
from
the
day
i
first
saw
him
nor
ever
in
all
the
years
that
have
passed
has
he
failed
of
the
promise
made
then
no
one
ever
helped
as
he
did
for
two
years
we
were
brothers
in
mulberry
street
when
he
left
i
had
seen
its
golden
age
i
knew
too
well
the
evil
day
that
was
coming
back
to
have
any
heart
in
it
after
that
not
that
we
were
carried
heavenward
on
flowery
beds
of
ease
while
it
lasted
there
is
very
little
ease
where
theodore
roosevelt
leads
as
we
all
of
us
found
out
the
lawbreaker
found
it
out
who
predicted
scornfully
that
he
would
knuckle
down
to
politics
the
way
they
all
did
and
lived
to
respect
him
though
he
swore
at
him
as
the
one
of
them
all
who
was
stronger
than
pull
the
citizen
who
hastened
to
police
headquarters
with
anxious
entreaties
to
use
discretion
in
the
enforcement
of
unpopular
laws
found
it
out
and
went
away
with
a
new
and
breathless
notion
welling
up
in
him
of
an
official
sworn
duty
that
was
it
that
was
what
made
the
age
golden
that
for
the
first
time
a
moral
purpose
came
into
the
street
in
the
light
of
it
everything
was
transformed
illustration
president
theodore
roosevelt
of
the
police
board
not
all
at
once
it
took
us
weary
months
to
understand
that
the
shouting
about
the
enforcement
of
the
dead
excise
law
was
lying
treachery
or
rank
ignorance
one
as
bad
as
the
other
the
excise
law
was
not
dead
it
was
never
so
much
alive
as
under
tammany
but
it
was
enforced
only
against
those
who
needed
discipline
it
was
a
tammany
club
used
to
drive
them
into
camp
with
and
it
was
used
so
vigorously
that
no
less
than
eight
thousand
arrests
were
made
under
it
in
the
year
before
roosevelt
made
them
all
close
up
pretty
lively
corpse
that
but
we
understood
at
last
most
of
us
understood
that
the
of
the
police
blackmail
was
there
and
that
it
had
to
be
pulled
up
if
we
were
ever
to
get
farther
we
understood
that
we
were
the
victims
of
our
own
shamming
and
we
grew
to
be
better
citizens
for
it
the
police
force
became
an
army
of
heroes
for
a
season
all
the
good
in
it
came
out
and
there
is
a
lot
of
it
in
the
worst
of
times
roosevelt
had
the
true
philosopher
stone
that
turns
dross
to
gold
in
his
own
sturdy
faith
in
his
men
became
good
because
he
thought
them
so
by
which
i
am
not
to
be
understood
as
meaning
that
he
just
voted
them
good
the
police
for
instance
and
sat
by
waiting
to
see
the
wings
grow
no
but
he
helped
them
sprout
it
is
long
since
i
have
enjoyed
anything
so
much
as
i
did
those
patrol
trips
of
ours
on
the
last
tour
between
midnight
and
sunrise
which
earned
for
him
the
name
of
haroun
al
roosevelt
i
had
at
last
found
one
who
was
willing
to
get
up
when
other
people
slept
including
too
often
the
police
and
see
what
the
town
looked
like
then
he
was
more
than
willing
i
laid
out
the
route
covering
ten
or
a
dozen
and
we
met
at
on
the
steps
of
the
union
league
club
objects
of
suspicion
on
the
part
of
two
or
three
attendants
and
a
watchman
who
shadowed
us
as
till
we
were
out
of
their
bailiwick
i
shall
never
forget
that
first
morning
when
we
travelled
for
three
hours
along
first
and
second
and
third
avenues
from
street
to
bellevue
and
found
of
ten
patrolmen
just
one
doing
his
work
faithfully
two
or
three
were
chatting
on
saloon
corners
and
guyed
the
president
of
the
board
when
he
asked
them
if
that
was
what
they
were
there
for
one
was
sitting
asleep
on
a
in
the
middle
of
the
sidewalk
snoring
so
that
you
could
hear
him
across
the
street
and
was
inclined
to
be
sassy
when
aroused
and
told
to
go
about
his
duty
roosevelt
was
a
most
energetic
roundsman
and
a
fair
one
to
boot
it
was
that
quality
which
speedily
won
him
the
affection
of
the
force
he
hunted
high
and
low
before
he
gave
up
his
man
giving
him
every
chance
we
had
been
over
one
man
beat
three
times
searching
every
nook
and
cranny
of
it
and
were
reluctantly
compelled
to
own
that
he
was
not
there
when
the
boss
of
an
restaurant
on
third
avenue
came
out
with
a
club
as
we
passed
and
gave
the
regulation
signal
raps
on
the
sidewalk
there
was
some
trouble
in
his
place
three
times
he
repeated
the
signal
calling
for
the
patrolman
on
the
beat
before
he
turned
to
roosevelt
who
stood
by
with
the
angry
exclamation
where
in
thunder
does
that
copper
sleep
he
orter
tole
me
when
he
giv
up
the
so
a
fellow
could
find
him
illustration
one
was
sitting
asleep
on
a
we
did
find
him
then
but
he
found
the
president
of
the
board
later
on
when
summoned
to
police
headquarters
to
explain
why
he
had
changed
his
sleeping
quarters
the
whole
force
woke
up
as
a
result
of
that
night
work
and
it
kept
awake
those
two
years
for
as
it
learned
by
experience
roosevelt
spectacles
might
come
gleaming
around
the
corner
at
any
hour
he
had
not
been
gone
a
year
before
the
chief
found
it
necessary
to
transfer
half
the
force
in
an
precinct
to
keep
it
awake
the
firemen
complained
that
fires
at
night
gained
too
much
headway
while
the
police
slept
there
was
no
roosevelt
to
wake
them
up
looking
after
his
patrolmen
was
not
the
only
errand
that
took
him
abroad
at
night
as
police
president
roosevelt
was
a
member
of
the
health
board
and
sometimes
it
was
the
tenements
we
went
inspecting
when
the
tenants
slept
he
was
after
facts
and
learned
speedily
to
get
them
as
he
could
when
as
governor
he
wanted
to
know
just
how
the
factory
law
was
being
executed
he
came
down
from
albany
and
spent
a
whole
day
with
me
personally
investigating
tenements
in
which
sweating
was
carried
on
i
had
not
found
a
governor
before
or
a
police
president
either
who
would
do
it
but
so
he
learned
exactly
what
he
wanted
to
know
and
what
he
ought
to
do
and
did
it
i
never
saw
theodore
roosevelt
to
better
advantage
than
when
he
confronted
the
labor
men
at
their
clarendon
hall
the
police
were
all
the
time
having
trouble
with
strikers
and
their
pickets
roosevelt
saw
that
it
was
because
neither
party
understood
fully
the
position
of
the
other
and
with
his
usual
directness
sent
word
to
the
labor
organizations
that
he
would
like
to
talk
it
over
with
them
at
his
request
i
went
with
him
to
the
meeting
it
developed
almost
immediately
that
the
labor
men
had
taken
a
wrong
measure
of
the
man
they
met
him
as
a
politician
playing
for
points
and
hinted
at
trouble
unless
their
demands
were
met
roosevelt
broke
them
off
short
gentlemen
he
said
with
that
snap
of
the
jaws
that
always
made
people
listen
i
asked
to
meet
you
hoping
that
we
might
come
to
understand
one
another
remember
please
before
we
go
farther
that
the
worst
injury
any
one
of
you
can
do
to
the
cause
of
labor
is
to
counsel
violence
it
will
also
be
worse
for
himself
understand
distinctly
that
order
will
be
kept
the
police
will
keep
it
now
we
can
proceed
i
was
never
so
proud
and
pleased
as
when
they
applauded
him
to
the
echo
he
reddened
with
pleasure
for
he
saw
that
the
best
in
them
had
come
out
on
top
as
he
expected
it
would
it
was
of
this
incident
that
a
handle
was
first
made
by
enemies
in
and
out
of
the
police
board
and
he
had
many
to
attack
him
it
happened
that
there
was
a
music
hall
in
the
building
in
which
the
labor
men
met
the
yellow
newspapers
circulated
the
lie
that
he
went
there
on
purpose
to
see
the
show
and
the
ridiculous
story
was
repeated
until
the
liars
nearly
persuaded
themselves
that
it
was
so
they
would
not
have
been
able
to
understand
the
kind
of
man
they
had
to
do
with
had
they
tried
accordingly
they
fell
into
their
own
trap
it
is
a
tradition
of
mulberry
street
that
the
notorious
seeley
dinner
raid
was
planned
by
his
enemies
in
the
department
of
which
he
was
the
head
in
the
belief
that
they
would
catch
roosevelt
there
the
diners
were
supposed
to
be
his
set
some
time
after
that
i
was
in
his
office
one
day
when
a
police
official
of
superior
rank
came
in
and
requested
private
audience
with
him
they
stepped
aside
and
the
policeman
spoke
in
an
undertone
urging
something
strongly
roosevelt
listened
suddenly
i
saw
him
straighten
up
as
a
man
recoils
from
something
unclean
and
dismiss
the
other
with
a
sharp
no
sir
i
do
fight
that
way
the
policeman
went
out
crestfallen
roosevelt
took
two
or
three
turns
about
the
floor
struggling
evidently
with
strong
disgust
he
told
me
afterward
that
the
man
had
come
to
him
with
what
he
said
was
certain
knowledge
that
his
enemy
could
that
night
be
found
in
a
known
evil
house
which
it
was
his
alleged
habit
to
visit
his
proposition
was
to
raid
it
then
and
so
get
square
to
the
policeman
it
must
have
seemed
like
throwing
a
good
chance
away
but
it
was
not
roosevelt
way
he
struck
no
blow
below
the
belt
in
the
governor
chair
afterward
he
gave
the
politicians
whom
he
fought
and
who
fought
him
the
same
terms
they
tried
their
best
to
upset
him
for
they
had
nothing
to
expect
from
him
but
they
knew
and
owned
that
he
fought
fair
their
backs
were
secure
he
never
tricked
them
to
gain
an
advantage
a
promise
given
by
him
was
always
kept
to
the
letter
failing
to
trap
him
only
added
to
the
malignity
of
his
enemies
roosevelt
was
warned
that
he
was
shadowed
night
and
day
but
he
laughed
their
scheming
to
scorn
it
is
an
article
of
faith
with
him
that
an
honest
man
has
nothing
to
fear
from
plotters
and
he
walked
unharmed
among
their
snares
the
whole
country
remembers
the
yearlong
fight
in
the
police
board
and
mayor
strong
vain
attempt
to
remove
the
obstructionist
who
under
an
law
was
able
to
hold
up
the
scheme
of
reform
most
of
the
time
i
was
compelled
to
stand
idly
by
unable
to
help
once
i
eased
my
feelings
by
telling
commissioner
parker
in
his
own
office
what
i
thought
of
him
i
went
in
and
shut
the
door
and
then
told
it
all
to
him
nor
did
i
mince
matters
i
might
not
get
so
good
a
chance
again
parker
sat
quite
still
poking
the
fire
when
i
ceased
at
last
angry
and
exasperated
he
looked
up
and
said
calmly
well
riis
what
you
tell
me
has
at
least
the
merit
of
frankness
you
see
how
it
was
i
should
never
have
been
able
to
help
in
the
board
out
of
it
my
chance
came
at
last
when
it
was
deemed
necessary
to
give
the
adversary
a
character
roosevelt
had
been
speaking
to
the
methodist
ministers
and
as
usual
had
carried
all
before
him
the
community
was
getting
up
a
temper
that
would
shortly
put
an
end
to
the
deadlock
in
the
police
board
and
set
the
wheels
of
reform
moving
again
then
one
day
we
heard
that
commissioner
parker
had
been
invited
by
the
christian
endeavorers
of
an
church
to
address
them
on
christian
citizenship
that
was
not
consecrated
common
sense
i
went
to
the
convention
of
endeavorers
the
next
week
and
told
them
so
i
asked
them
to
send
a
despatch
to
governor
black
then
and
there
endorsing
roosevelt
and
mayor
strong
and
urging
him
to
end
the
deadlock
that
made
public
scandal
by
removing
commissioner
parker
and
they
did
i
regret
to
say
that
i
felt
compelled
to
take
a
like
course
with
the
methodist
ministers
for
so
i
grieved
a
most
gentleman
colonel
grant
who
was
parker
ally
in
the
board
grant
was
what
was
described
as
a
great
methodist
but
i
feel
sure
that
brother
simmons
would
have
approved
of
me
i
was
following
the
course
he
laid
down
the
one
loyal
friend
roosevelt
had
in
the
board
was
avery
andrews
a
strong
sensible
and
clean
young
man
who
stood
by
his
chief
to
the
last
and
left
with
him
a
good
mark
on
the
force
the
yellow
newspapers
fomented
most
industriously
the
trouble
in
the
board
never
failing
to
take
the
wrong
side
of
any
question
one
of
them
set
about
doling
out
free
soup
that
winter
when
work
was
slack
as
a
means
of
course
of
advertising
its
own
charity
of
all
forms
of
indiscriminate
almsgiving
that
is
the
most
offensive
and
most
worthless
and
they
knew
it
or
they
would
not
have
sent
me
a
wheedling
invitation
to
come
and
inspect
their
relief
work
offering
to
have
a
carriage
take
me
around
i
sent
word
back
that
i
should
certainly
look
into
the
soup
but
that
i
should
go
on
foot
to
it
roosevelt
and
i
made
the
inspection
together
we
questioned
the
tramps
in
line
and
learned
from
their
own
lips
that
they
had
come
from
out
of
town
to
take
it
easy
in
a
city
where
a
man
did
not
have
to
work
to
live
we
followed
the
pails
that
were
carried
away
from
the
relief
station
by
children
their
contents
sometimes
to
figure
afterwards
as
free
lunch
in
the
saloon
where
they
had
been
exchanged
for
beer
and
knowing
the
facts
we
denounced
the
thing
as
a
nuisance
the
paper
printed
testimonials
from
commissioners
parker
and
grant
who
certified
from
mulberry
street
which
they
had
not
left
that
the
soup
was
a
noble
christian
charity
and
so
thought
it
evened
things
up
i
suppose
i
noticed
however
that
the
soup
ran
out
soon
after
and
i
hope
we
have
seen
the
last
of
it
we
can
afford
to
leave
that
to
philadelphia
where
common
sense
appears
to
be
drowned
in
it
i
had
it
out
with
them
at
last
all
together
when
i
have
told
of
it
let
the
whole
wretched
thing
depart
and
be
gone
for
good
it
was
after
roosevelt
had
gone
away
that
he
was
not
there
was
no
bar
to
almost
daily
attacks
on
him
under
which
i
chafed
sitting
at
the
meetings
as
a
reporter
i
knew
right
well
they
were
intended
to
provoke
me
to
an
explosion
that
might
have
given
grounds
for
annoying
me
and
i
kept
my
temper
until
one
day
when
the
subject
of
dives
being
mentioned
commissioner
parker
drawled
with
the
reporter
from
the
soup
journal
whispering
in
his
ear
was
not
that
the
place
where
er
r
roosevelt
went
to
see
a
show
with
his
friend
he
was
careful
not
to
look
in
my
direction
but
the
reporter
did
and
i
leaped
at
the
challenge
i
waited
until
the
board
had
formally
adjourned
then
halted
it
as
parker
was
trying
to
escape
i
do
not
now
remember
what
i
said
it
would
not
make
calm
reading
i
suspect
it
was
the
truth
anyhow
and
came
pretty
near
being
the
whole
truth
parker
fled
putting
his
head
back
through
the
door
to
explain
that
he
only
knew
what
that
reporter
told
him
in
the
security
of
his
room
it
must
have
occurred
to
him
however
that
he
had
another
string
to
his
bow
for
at
the
next
session
commissioner
grant
moved
my
expulsion
because
i
had
disturbed
the
board
meeting
but
president
moss
reminded
him
curtly
that
i
had
done
nothing
of
the
kind
and
that
ended
it
one
of
the
early
and
sensational
results
of
reform
in
mulberry
street
was
the
retirement
of
superintendent
byrnes
there
was
not
one
of
us
all
who
had
known
him
long
who
did
not
regret
it
though
i
for
one
had
to
own
the
necessity
of
it
for
byrnes
stood
for
the
old
days
that
were
bad
but
chained
as
he
was
in
the
meanness
and
smallness
of
it
all
he
was
yet
cast
in
a
different
mould
compared
with
his
successor
he
was
a
giant
every
way
byrnes
was
a
big
policeman
we
shall
not
soon
have
another
like
him
and
that
may
be
both
good
and
bad
he
was
unscrupulous
he
was
for
byrnes
he
was
a
policeman
in
short
with
all
the
failings
of
the
trade
but
he
made
the
detective
service
great
he
chased
the
thieves
to
europe
or
gave
them
license
to
live
in
new
york
on
condition
that
they
did
not
rob
there
he
was
a
czar
with
all
an
autocrat
irresponsible
powers
and
he
exercised
them
as
he
saw
fit
if
they
were
not
his
he
took
them
anyhow
police
service
looks
to
results
first
there
was
that
in
byrnes
which
made
me
stand
up
for
him
in
spite
of
it
all
twice
i
held
parkhurst
from
his
throat
but
in
the
end
i
had
to
admit
that
the
doctor
was
right
i
believed
that
untrammelled
byrnes
might
have
been
a
mighty
engine
for
good
and
it
was
with
sorrow
i
saw
him
go
he
left
no
one
behind
him
fit
to
wear
his
shoes
illustration
chief
of
police
thomas
byrnes
byrnes
was
a
born
policeman
those
who
hated
him
said
he
was
also
a
born
tyrant
he
did
ride
a
high
horse
when
the
fit
was
on
him
and
he
thought
it
served
his
purpose
so
we
came
into
collision
in
the
early
days
when
he
was
captain
in
mercer
street
they
had
a
prisoner
over
there
with
a
story
which
i
had
cause
to
believe
my
rivals
had
obtained
i
went
to
byrnes
and
was
thundered
out
of
the
there
he
was
boss
and
it
suited
him
to
let
me
see
it
we
had
not
met
before
but
we
met
again
that
night
i
went
to
the
superintendent
of
police
who
was
a
republican
and
applying
all
the
pressure
of
the
which
i
served
got
from
him
an
order
on
captain
byrnes
to
let
me
interview
his
prisoner
old
walling
tore
his
hair
said
the
thing
had
never
been
done
before
and
it
had
not
but
i
got
the
order
and
got
the
interview
though
byrnes
black
with
rage
commanded
a
policeman
to
stand
on
either
side
of
the
prisoner
while
i
talked
to
him
he
himself
stood
by
glaring
at
me
it
was
not
a
good
way
to
get
an
interview
and
in
fact
the
man
had
nothing
to
tell
but
i
had
my
way
and
i
made
the
most
of
it
after
that
captain
byrnes
and
i
got
along
we
got
to
think
a
lot
of
each
other
after
a
while
perhaps
he
was
a
tyrant
because
he
was
set
over
crooks
and
crooks
are
cowards
in
the
presence
of
authority
his
famous
third
degree
was
chiefly
what
he
no
doubt
considered
a
little
wholesome
slugging
he
would
beat
a
thief
into
telling
him
what
he
wanted
to
know
thieves
have
no
rights
a
policeman
thinks
himself
bound
to
respect
but
when
he
had
to
do
with
men
with
minds
he
had
other
resources
he
tortured
his
prisoner
into
confession
in
the
unger
murder
case
by
locking
him
up
out
of
reach
of
a
human
voice
or
sight
of
a
human
face
in
the
basement
of
police
headquarters
and
keeping
him
there
four
days
fed
by
invisible
hands
on
the
fifth
he
had
him
brought
up
through
a
tortuous
way
where
the
tools
he
had
used
in
murdering
his
partner
were
displayed
on
the
walls
as
if
by
accident
led
into
the
inspector
presence
by
the
jailer
he
was
made
to
stand
while
byrnes
finished
a
letter
then
he
turned
his
piercing
glance
upon
him
with
a
gesture
to
sit
the
murderer
sank
trembling
upon
a
lounge
the
only
piece
of
furniture
in
the
room
and
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
shriek
the
next
instant
it
was
the
one
upon
which
he
had
slaughtered
his
friend
all
as
then
he
sprawled
upon
the
floor
a
gibbering
wretch
and
confessed
his
sin
as
in
this
instance
so
in
the
mcgloin
murder
case
the
moral
certainty
of
guilt
was
absolute
but
the
legal
evidence
was
lacking
mcgloin
was
a
young
ruffian
who
had
murdered
a
at
a
midnight
raid
on
his
place
he
was
the
fellow
who
the
night
before
he
was
hanged
invited
the
chief
of
detectives
to
come
over
to
the
wake
they
have
a
devil
of
a
time
for
six
months
byrnes
had
tried
everything
to
bring
the
crime
home
to
him
but
in
vain
at
last
he
sent
out
and
had
mcgloin
and
his
two
pals
arrested
but
so
that
none
of
them
knew
of
the
plight
of
the
others
mcgloin
was
taken
to
mulberry
street
and
orders
were
given
to
bring
the
others
in
at
a
certain
hour
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
apart
byrnes
put
mcgloin
at
the
window
in
his
office
while
he
questioned
him
nothing
could
be
got
out
of
him
as
he
sat
there
a
door
was
banged
below
looking
out
he
saw
one
of
his
friends
led
across
the
yard
in
charge
of
policemen
byrnes
watching
him
narrowly
saw
his
cheek
blanch
but
still
his
nerve
held
fifteen
minutes
passed
another
door
banged
the
murderer
looking
out
saw
his
other
pal
led
in
a
prisoner
he
looked
at
byrnes
the
chief
nodded
squealed
both
it
was
a
lie
and
it
cost
the
man
his
life
the
jig
is
up
then
he
said
and
told
the
story
that
brought
him
to
the
gallows
i
could
not
let
byrnes
go
without
a
word
for
he
filled
a
large
space
in
my
life
it
is
the
reporter
i
suppose
who
sticks
out
there
the
boys
called
him
a
great
faker
but
they
were
hardly
just
to
him
in
that
i
should
rather
call
him
a
great
actor
and
without
being
that
no
man
can
be
a
great
detective
he
made
life
in
a
mean
street
picturesque
while
he
was
there
and
for
that
something
is
due
him
he
was
the
very
opposite
of
roosevelt
quite
without
moral
purpose
or
the
comprehension
of
it
yet
with
a
streak
of
kindness
in
him
that
sometimes
put
preaching
to
shame
mulberry
street
swears
by
him
even
as
it
does
under
its
breath
by
roosevelt
decide
from
that
for
yourself
whether
his
presence
there
was
for
the
good
or
the
bad
in
writing
how
the
other
half
lives
i
had
been
at
great
pains
not
to
overstate
my
case
i
knew
that
it
would
be
questioned
and
was
anxious
that
no
flaws
should
be
picked
in
it
for
if
there
were
harm
might
easily
come
of
it
instead
of
good
i
saw
now
that
in
that
i
had
been
wise
the
gilder
commission
more
than
confirmed
all
that
i
had
said
about
the
tenements
and
the
schools
the
reinhardt
committee
was
even
more
emphatic
on
the
topic
of
child
labor
i
was
asked
to
serve
on
the
seventy
on
small
parks
in
the
spring
of
the
council
of
confederated
good
government
clubs
appointed
me
its
general
agent
and
i
held
the
position
for
a
year
giving
all
my
spare
time
to
the
planning
and
carrying
out
of
such
work
as
it
seemed
to
me
ought
to
make
a
record
for
a
reform
administration
we
wanted
it
to
last
that
was
a
great
year
they
wanted
a
positive
programme
and
my
notions
of
good
government
were
nothing
if
not
positive
they
began
and
ended
with
the
people
life
we
tore
down
unfit
tenements
forced
the
opening
of
parks
and
playgrounds
the
establishment
of
a
truant
school
and
the
remodelling
of
the
whole
school
system
the
demolition
of
the
overcrowded
old
tombs
and
the
erection
on
its
site
of
a
decent
new
prison
we
overhauled
the
civil
courts
and
made
them
over
new
in
the
charter
of
the
greater
new
york
we
lighted
dark
halls
closed
the
cruller
bakeries
in
cellars
that
had
caused
the
loss
of
no
end
of
lives
for
the
crullers
were
boiled
in
fat
in
the
early
morning
hours
while
the
tenants
slept
and
when
the
fat
was
spilled
in
the
fire
their
peril
was
awful
we
fought
the
managers
at
home
and
the
opponents
of
a
truant
school
at
albany
we
backed
up
roosevelt
in
his
fight
in
the
police
board
and
well
i
shall
never
get
time
to
tell
it
all
but
it
was
a
great
year
that
it
did
not
keep
the
good
government
clubs
alive
was
no
fault
of
my
programme
it
was
mine
i
guess
i
failed
to
inspire
them
with
the
faith
that
was
in
me
i
had
been
going
it
alone
so
long
that
i
did
not
know
how
to
use
the
new
tool
that
had
come
to
hand
there
is
nothing
like
an
organization
if
you
know
how
to
use
it
i
did
not
perhaps
also
politics
had
something
to
do
with
it
they
were
in
for
playing
the
game
i
never
understood
it
but
if
i
did
not
make
the
most
of
it
i
had
a
good
time
that
year
there
were
first
the
two
small
parks
to
be
laid
out
over
on
the
east
side
where
the
gilder
commission
had
pointed
to
the
smothering
crowds
i
had
myself
made
a
member
of
the
citizens
committee
that
was
appointed
to
locate
them
it
did
not
take
us
any
nine
years
or
six
or
three
we
did
the
business
in
three
weeks
and
having
chosen
the
right
spots
we
went
to
the
legislature
with
a
bill
authorizing
the
city
to
seize
the
property
at
once
ahead
of
condemnation
and
it
was
passed
we
were
afraid
that
tammany
might
come
back
and
the
event
proved
that
we
were
wise
you
bring
up
the
people
slowly
to
a
reform
programme
particularly
when
it
costs
money
they
will
pay
for
corruption
with
a
growl
but
seem
to
think
that
virtue
ought
always
to
be
had
for
nothing
it
makes
the
politicians
game
easy
they
steal
the
money
for
improvements
and
predict
that
reform
will
raise
the
when
the
prophecy
comes
true
they
take
the
people
back
in
their
sheltering
embrace
with
an
i
told
you
so
and
the
people
nestle
there
repentant
there
was
a
housing
conference
at
which
that
part
of
the
work
was
parcelled
out
the
building
of
model
tenements
to
the
capitalists
who
formed
the
city
and
suburban
homes
company
the
erection
of
model
to
o
mills
the
banker
philanthropist
who
was
anxious
to
help
that
way
i
chose
for
the
good
government
clubs
the
demolition
of
the
old
tenements
it
was
my
chance
i
hated
them
a
law
had
been
made
the
year
before
empowering
the
health
board
to
seize
and
destroy
property
that
was
a
threat
to
the
health
but
it
had
remained
a
dead
letter
the
authorities
hesitated
to
attack
property
rights
vested
rights
charles
wilson
the
president
of
the
board
was
a
splendid
executive
but
he
was
a
holdover
tammany
appointee
and
needed
backing
now
that
theodore
roosevelt
sat
in
the
health
board
fresh
from
his
war
on
the
police
of
which
i
told
they
hesitated
no
longer
i
put
before
the
board
a
list
of
the
sixteen
worst
rear
tenements
in
the
city
outside
of
the
bend
and
while
the
landlords
held
their
breath
in
astonishment
they
were
seized
condemned
and
their
tenants
driven
out
the
mott
street
barracks
were
among
them
in
the
infant
among
the
italians
they
harbored
had
been
per
thousand
that
is
to
say
of
all
the
babies
died
that
year
that
was
the
kind
of
evidence
upon
which
those
rear
tenements
were
arraigned
of
them
all
told
were
seized
that
year
and
in
them
there
had
been
in
four
years
deaths
a
rate
of
when
the
general
city
was
i
shall
have
once
more
and
for
the
last
time
to
refer
to
a
ten
years
war
for
the
full
story
of
that
campaign
as
i
said
it
was
great
illustration
the
mott
street
barracks
conceive
if
you
can
the
state
of
mind
of
a
man
to
whom
a
dark
overcrowded
tenement
had
ever
been
as
a
personal
affront
now
suddenly
finding
himself
commissioned
with
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
as
it
were
to
seize
and
destroy
the
enemy
wherever
found
not
one
at
a
time
but
by
blocks
and
battalions
in
the
laying
out
of
parks
i
fed
fat
my
ancient
grudge
and
grew
good
humor
enough
to
last
me
for
a
dozen
years
in
those
two
they
were
the
years
when
in
spite
of
hard
work
i
began
to
grow
stout
and
honestly
i
think
it
was
tearing
down
tenements
that
did
it
directly
or
indirectly
i
had
a
hand
in
destroying
seven
whole
blocks
of
them
as
i
count
it
up
i
wish
it
had
been
seventy
the
landlords
sued
but
the
courts
sided
with
the
health
board
when
at
last
we
stopped
to
take
breath
we
had
fairly
broken
the
back
of
the
slum
and
made
precedents
of
our
own
that
would
last
a
while
roosevelt
was
personally
sued
twice
i
think
but
that
was
all
the
good
it
did
them
we
were
having
our
innings
that
time
and
there
were
a
lot
of
arrears
to
collect
the
city
paid
for
the
property
that
was
taken
of
course
and
more
than
it
ought
to
have
paid
to
my
way
of
thinking
the
law
gave
the
owner
of
a
tenement
that
was
altogether
unfit
just
the
value
of
the
brick
and
timbers
that
were
in
it
it
was
enough
for
unfit
meant
murderous
and
why
should
a
man
have
a
better
right
to
kill
his
neighbor
with
a
house
than
with
an
axe
in
the
street
but
the
lawyers
who
counseled
compromise
bought
gotham
court
one
of
the
most
hopeless
slums
in
the
fourth
ward
for
nearly
it
was
not
worth
so
many
cents
the
barracks
with
their
awful
baby
were
found
to
be
mortgaged
to
a
cemetery
corporation
the
board
of
health
gave
them
the
price
of
opening
one
grave
for
their
share
and
tore
down
the
rear
tenements
a
year
or
two
later
i
travelled
to
europe
on
an
ocean
steamer
with
the
treasurer
of
that
graveyard
concern
we
were
ten
days
on
the
way
and
i
am
afraid
he
did
not
have
altogether
a
good
time
of
it
the
ghost
of
the
barracks
would
keep
rising
out
of
the
deep
before
us
sitting
there
in
our
steamer
chairs
from
whichever
quarter
the
wind
blew
i
suppose
he
took
it
as
a
victory
when
the
court
of
appeals
decided
upon
a
technicality
that
the
barracks
should
not
have
been
destroyed
but
so
did
i
for
they
were
down
by
that
time
the
city
could
afford
to
pay
we
were
paying
for
our
own
neglect
and
it
was
a
good
lesson
i
have
said
more
than
once
in
these
pages
that
i
am
not
good
at
figuring
and
i
am
not
a
child
could
do
better
for
that
very
reason
i
am
going
to
claim
full
credit
for
every
time
i
do
a
sum
right
it
may
not
happen
again
twice
during
that
spell
curiously
enough
did
i
downright
distinguish
myself
in
that
line
i
shall
never
be
able
to
tell
you
how
i
only
know
that
i
did
it
once
was
when
i
went
before
the
board
of
estimate
and
apportionment
to
oppose
an
increase
in
the
appropriation
for
the
tombs
which
the
commissioner
of
correction
had
asked
for
his
plea
was
that
there
had
been
a
large
increase
in
the
census
of
the
prison
and
he
marched
up
a
column
of
figures
to
prove
it
to
the
amazement
of
the
board
and
really
if
the
truth
be
told
of
myself
i
demonstrated
clearly
from
his
own
figures
that
not
only
had
there
been
no
increase
but
that
there
could
not
be
without
criminally
overcrowding
the
wretched
old
prison
in
which
already
every
cell
had
two
inmates
and
some
three
the
exhibit
was
so
striking
that
the
commissioner
and
his
bookkeeper
retired
in
confusion
it
was
just
the
power
of
the
facts
again
i
wanted
to
have
the
horrid
old
pile
torn
down
and
had
been
sitting
up
nights
acquainting
myself
with
all
that
concerned
it
now
it
is
gone
and
a
good
riddance
to
it
illustration
gotham
court
the
other
computation
was
vastly
more
involved
it
concerned
the
schools
about
which
no
one
knew
anything
for
certain
the
annual
reports
of
the
department
of
education
were
models
of
how
to
say
a
thing
so
that
no
one
by
any
chance
could
understand
what
it
was
about
it
was
possible
to
prove
from
them
that
while
there
was
notoriously
a
dearth
of
school
accommodation
while
children
knocked
vainly
for
admission
and
the
superintendent
clamored
for
more
schools
yet
there
were
ten
or
twenty
thousand
seats
to
spare
but
it
was
not
possible
to
get
the
least
notion
from
them
of
what
the
real
need
was
i
tried
for
many
months
and
then
set
about
finding
out
for
myself
how
many
children
who
ought
to
be
in
school
were
drifting
about
the
streets
the
truant
officers
professionally
discreet
thought
about
the
superintendent
of
schools
guessed
at
the
officers
of
the
association
for
the
improvement
of
the
condition
of
the
poor
with
an
eye
on
the
tenements
made
it
i
canvassed
a
couple
of
wards
from
the
truant
reports
and
tracy
compared
the
showing
with
the
statistics
of
population
from
the
result
i
reasoned
that
there
must
be
about
they
scorned
me
at
the
city
hall
for
it
it
was
all
they
said
and
so
it
was
we
had
first
to
have
a
school
census
and
we
got
one
so
that
we
might
know
where
we
were
at
but
when
we
had
the
result
of
that
first
census
before
us
behold
it
showed
that
of
children
of
school
age
in
the
city
were
accounted
for
on
the
roster
of
public
or
private
schools
were
employed
and
on
the
street
or
at
home
so
that
if
i
am
not
smart
at
figuring
i
may
reasonably
claim
to
be
a
good
guesser
the
showing
that
a
lack
of
schools
which
threw
an
army
of
children
upon
the
street
went
hand
in
hand
with
overcrowded
jails
made
us
get
up
and
demand
that
something
be
done
from
the
school
executive
came
the
helpless
suggestion
that
the
thing
might
be
mended
by
increasing
the
classes
in
neighborhoods
where
there
were
not
enough
schools
from
sixty
to
forty
or
pupils
is
held
to
be
the
safe
limit
anywhere
but
the
time
had
passed
for
such
pottering
new
york
pulled
itself
together
and
spent
millions
in
building
new
schools
while
the
system
was
overhauled
we
dragged
in
a
truant
school
by
threatening
the
city
authorities
with
the
power
of
the
state
unless
they
ceased
to
send
truants
to
institutions
that
received
child
criminals
but
a
man
convinced
against
his
will
is
of
the
same
opinion
still
we
shall
have
to
do
that
all
over
again
next
my
pet
scheme
was
to
have
trained
oculists
attached
to
the
public
schools
partly
as
a
means
of
overcoming
stupidity
half
of
what
passes
for
that
in
the
children
is
really
the
teacher
the
little
ones
are
they
can
not
see
the
blackboard
partly
also
that
they
might
have
an
eye
on
the
school
buildings
and
help
us
get
rid
of
some
where
they
had
to
burn
gas
all
day
that
was
upset
by
the
doctors
who
were
afraid
that
private
practice
would
be
interfered
with
we
had
not
quite
got
to
the
millennium
yet
it
was
so
with
our
bill
to
establish
a
farm
school
to
win
back
young
vagrants
to
a
useful
life
it
was
killed
at
albany
with
the
challenge
that
we
had
had
enough
of
reform
in
new
york
and
so
we
had
as
the
events
showed
tammany
came
back
but
not
to
stay
we
had
secured
a
hold
during
those
three
years
which
i
think
they
little
know
of
they
talk
at
the
wigwam
of
the
school
vote
and
mean
the
men
friends
and
kin
of
the
teachers
on
whom
the
machine
has
a
grip
or
thinks
it
has
but
there
is
another
school
vote
that
is
yet
to
be
heard
from
when
the
generation
that
has
had
its
right
to
play
restored
to
it
comes
to
the
polls
that
was
the
great
gain
of
that
time
it
was
the
thing
i
had
in
mind
back
of
and
beyond
all
the
rest
i
was
bound
to
kill
the
bend
because
it
was
bad
i
wanted
the
sunlight
in
there
but
so
that
it
might
shine
on
the
children
at
play
that
is
a
child
right
and
it
is
not
to
be
cheated
of
it
and
when
it
is
cheated
of
it
it
is
not
the
child
but
the
community
that
is
robbed
of
that
beside
which
all
its
wealth
is
but
tinsel
and
trash
for
men
not
money
make
a
country
great
and
joyless
children
do
not
make
good
men
illustration
a
tenement
house
so
when
the
legislature
urged
by
the
tenement
house
commission
made
it
law
that
no
public
school
should
ever
again
be
built
in
new
york
without
an
outdoor
playground
it
touched
the
quick
thereafter
it
was
easy
to
rescue
the
small
parks
from
the
landscape
gardener
by
laying
them
under
the
same
rule
it
was
well
we
did
it
too
for
he
is
a
dangerous
customer
hard
to
get
around
twice
he
has
tried
to
steal
one
of
the
little
parks
we
laid
out
the
one
that
is
called
seward
park
from
the
children
and
he
points
with
pride
almost
to
the
playground
in
the
other
which
he
laid
out
so
badly
that
it
was
a
failure
from
the
start
however
we
shall
convert
him
yet
everything
in
its
season
the
board
of
education
puzzled
over
its
end
of
it
for
a
while
the
law
did
not
say
how
big
the
playground
should
be
and
there
was
no
precedent
no
there
was
not
i
found
the
key
to
that
puzzle
at
least
one
that
fitted
when
i
was
secretary
of
the
small
parks
committee
it
was
my
last
act
as
agent
of
the
good
government
clubs
to
persuade
major
strong
to
appoint
that
committee
it
made
short
work
of
its
task
we
sent
for
the
police
to
tell
us
where
they
had
trouble
with
the
boys
and
why
it
was
always
the
same
story
they
had
no
other
place
to
play
in
than
the
street
and
there
they
broke
windows
so
began
the
trouble
it
ended
in
the
and
the
jail
the
city
was
building
new
schools
by
the
score
we
got
a
list
of
the
sites
and
as
we
expected
they
were
where
the
trouble
was
worst
naturally
so
that
was
where
the
children
were
there
then
was
our
field
as
a
playground
committee
why
not
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
and
save
money
by
making
them
one
by
hitching
the
school
and
the
boys
play
together
we
should
speedily
get
rid
of
the
truant
he
was
just
there
as
a
protest
against
the
school
without
play
we
asked
the
board
of
education
to
make
their
school
playgrounds
the
neighborhood
recreation
centres
so
they
would
not
need
to
worry
over
how
big
they
should
be
but
just
make
them
as
big
as
they
could
whether
on
the
roof
or
on
the
ground
they
listened
but
found
difficulties
in
the
property
odd
is
it
this
disposition
of
the
world
to
forever
make
of
the
means
the
end
to
glorify
the
establishment
it
was
the
same
story
when
i
asked
them
to
open
the
schools
at
night
and
let
in
the
boys
to
have
their
clubs
there
the
saloon
was
bidding
for
them
and
bidding
high
but
the
school
board
hesitated
because
a
window
might
be
broken
or
a
janitor
want
extra
pay
for
cleaning
up
before
a
reluctant
consent
was
given
i
had
to
make
a
kind
of
promise
that
i
would
not
appear
before
the
board
again
to
argue
for
throwing
the
doors
wider
still
but
it
is
going
to
keep
me
from
putting
in
the
heaviest
licks
i
can
in
the
campaign
that
is
coming
for
turning
the
schools
over
to
the
people
bodily
and
making
of
them
the
neighborhood
centre
in
all
things
that
make
for
good
including
meetings
and
political
discussions
only
so
shall
we
make
of
our
schools
real
of
our
liberties
so
also
we
shall
through
neighborhood
pride
restore
some
of
the
neighborhood
feeling
the
feeling
that
is
now
lacking
in
our
cities
to
our
grievous
loss
half
the
population
is
always
moving
and
to
the
children
the
word
home
has
no
meaning
anything
that
will
help
change
that
will
be
a
great
gain
and
that
old
board
is
gone
long
since
anyhow
the
club
prevailed
in
the
end
at
least
one
school
let
it
in
and
though
the
boys
did
break
a
that
winter
with
a
ball
they
paid
for
it
like
men
and
that
ghost
was
laid
the
school
playground
holds
aloof
yet
from
the
neighborhood
except
in
the
long
vacation
but
that
last
is
something
and
the
rest
is
coming
it
could
not
be
coming
by
any
better
road
than
the
vacation
schools
which
are
paving
the
way
for
common
sense
everywhere
everything
takes
ten
years
said
abram
hewitt
when
he
took
his
seat
as
the
chairman
of
the
small
parks
committee
ten
years
before
when
he
was
mayor
he
had
put
through
the
law
under
which
the
mulberry
bend
had
been
at
last
wiped
out
we
held
our
meetings
at
the
city
hall
where
i
had
been
spurned
so
often
all
things
come
to
those
who
wait
and
fight
for
them
yes
fight
i
say
it
advisedly
i
have
come
to
the
time
of
life
when
a
man
does
not
lay
about
him
with
a
club
unless
he
has
to
but
eternal
vigilance
is
the
price
of
liberty
to
be
vigilant
is
to
sit
up
with
a
club
we
as
a
people
have
provided
in
the
republic
a
means
of
fighting
for
our
rights
and
getting
them
and
it
is
our
business
to
do
it
we
shall
never
get
them
in
any
other
way
colonel
waring
was
a
wise
man
as
well
as
a
great
man
his
declaration
that
he
cleaned
the
streets
of
new
york
all
prophecies
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
by
putting
a
man
instead
of
a
voter
behind
every
broom
deserves
to
be
put
on
the
monument
we
shall
build
by
and
by
to
that
courageous
man
for
it
is
the
whole
gospel
of
municipal
righteousness
in
a
nutshell
but
he
never
said
anything
better
than
when
he
advised
his
to
fight
not
to
plead
for
their
rights
so
we
grow
the
kind
of
citizenship
that
sets
the
world
or
anyhow
our
day
ahead
we
will
all
hail
the
day
when
we
shall
be
able
to
lay
down
the
club
but
until
it
comes
i
do
not
see
that
we
have
any
choice
but
to
keep
a
firm
grip
on
it
chapter
xiv
i
try
to
go
to
the
war
for
the
third
and
last
time
that
which
i
have
described
as
sitting
up
with
a
club
in
a
city
like
new
york
is
bound
to
win
your
fight
if
you
sit
up
long
enough
for
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
the
politicians
who
oppose
good
government
are
not
primarily
concerned
about
keeping
you
out
of
your
rights
they
want
the
things
that
make
for
their
advantage
first
of
all
the
offices
through
which
they
can
maintain
their
grip
after
that
they
will
concede
as
many
of
the
things
you
want
as
they
have
to
and
if
you
are
not
yourself
out
for
the
offices
more
than
otherwise
though
never
more
than
you
wring
out
of
them
they
really
do
not
care
if
you
do
have
clean
streets
good
schools
parks
playgrounds
and
all
the
things
which
make
for
good
citizenship
because
they
give
the
best
part
of
the
man
a
chance
though
they
grudge
them
as
a
sad
waste
of
money
that
might
be
turned
to
use
in
strengthening
the
organization
which
is
the
sum
of
all
their
being
their
means
of
ever
getting
more
and
more
hence
it
is
that
a
mere
handful
of
men
and
women
who
rarely
or
never
had
other
authority
than
their
own
unselfish
purpose
have
in
all
times
even
the
worst
been
able
to
put
their
stamp
upon
the
community
for
good
i
am
thinking
of
the
felix
adlers
the
rainsfords
the
josephine
shaw
lowells
the
robert
ross
mcburneys
the
fulton
cuttings
the
father
doyles
the
jacob
schiffs
the
robert
de
forests
the
arthur
von
briesens
the
norton
goddards
the
richard
watson
gilders
and
their
kind
and
thinking
of
them
brings
to
mind
an
opportunity
i
had
a
year
or
two
ago
to
tell
a
club
of
workmen
what
i
thought
of
them
it
was
at
the
chicago
commons
i
had
looked
in
on
a
sunday
evening
upon
a
group
of
men
engaged
in
what
seemed
to
me
a
singularly
unprofitable
discussion
of
human
motives
they
were
of
the
school
which
professes
to
believe
that
everything
proceeds
from
the
love
of
self
and
they
spoke
learnedly
of
the
ego
and
all
that
but
as
i
listened
the
conviction
grew
along
with
the
feeling
of
exasperation
that
sort
of
nonsense
always
arouses
in
me
that
they
were
just
vaporing
and
i
told
them
so
i
pointed
to
these
men
and
women
i
have
spoken
of
some
of
them
of
great
wealth
the
thing
against
which
they
seemed
to
have
a
special
grudge
and
told
them
how
they
had
given
their
lives
and
their
means
in
the
cause
of
humanity
without
asking
other
reward
than
that
of
seeing
the
world
grow
better
and
the
hard
lot
of
some
of
their
eased
wherein
they
had
succeeded
because
they
thought
less
of
themselves
than
of
their
neighbors
and
were
in
the
field
anyway
to
be
of
such
use
as
they
could
i
told
them
how
distressed
i
was
that
upon
their
own
admission
they
should
have
been
engaged
in
this
discussion
four
years
without
getting
any
farther
and
i
closed
with
a
remorseful
feeling
of
having
said
more
than
i
intended
and
perhaps
having
made
them
feel
bad
but
not
they
they
had
listened
to
me
throughout
with
undisturbed
serenity
when
i
had
done
the
chairman
said
courteously
that
they
were
greatly
indebted
to
me
for
my
frank
opinion
every
man
was
entitled
to
his
own
and
he
could
quite
sympathize
with
me
in
my
inability
to
catch
their
point
of
view
because
here
he
added
i
have
been
reading
for
ten
years
or
more
the
things
riis
writes
in
his
newspaper
and
in
the
magazines
and
by
which
he
makes
a
living
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
never
was
able
to
understand
how
any
one
could
be
found
to
pay
for
such
stuff
so
there
you
have
my
measure
as
a
reformer
the
meeting
nodded
gravely
i
was
apparently
the
only
one
there
who
took
it
as
a
joke
i
spoke
of
the
women
share
in
the
progress
we
made
a
good
big
one
it
was
we
should
have
been
floundering
yet
in
the
educational
we
were
in
had
it
not
been
for
the
women
of
new
york
who
went
to
albany
and
literally
held
up
the
legislature
compelling
it
to
pass
our
reform
bill
and
not
once
but
a
dozen
times
during
mayor
strong
administration
when
they
had
wearied
of
me
at
the
city
hall
i
was
not
always
there
with
the
reform
administration
did
i
find
it
the
part
of
wisdom
to
send
committees
of
women
instead
to
plead
with
the
mayor
over
his
five
tea
they
could
worm
a
playground
or
a
small
park
out
of
him
when
i
should
have
met
with
a
curt
refusal
and
a
virtual
invitation
to
be
gone
in
his
political
doldrums
the
mayor
did
not
have
a
kindly
eye
to
reformers
but
he
was
not
always
able
to
make
them
out
in
petticoats
illustration
the
school
of
the
new
day
the
women
prevailed
at
albany
by
the
power
of
fact
they
knew
and
the
legislators
did
not
they
received
them
up
there
with
an
indulgent
smile
but
it
became
speedily
apparent
that
they
came
bristling
with
information
about
the
schools
to
which
the
empty
old
tammany
boast
that
new
york
had
the
best
schools
in
the
world
was
not
an
effective
answer
in
fact
they
came
nearer
being
the
worst
i
had
myself
had
an
experience
of
that
kind
when
i
pointed
out
in
print
that
an
east
side
school
was
so
overrun
with
rats
that
it
was
difficult
to
hear
oneself
think
for
their
squeaking
in
the
dark
playground
when
the
children
were
upstairs
in
their
classes
the
board
of
estimate
and
apportionment
which
comprises
the
important
officials
of
the
city
government
with
the
mayor
as
presiding
officer
took
umbrage
at
the
statement
and
said
in
plain
words
that
i
lied
and
that
there
were
no
rats
that
was
a
piece
of
unthinking
ignorance
for
an
old
schoolhouse
without
rats
in
it
would
be
a
rare
thing
anywhere
but
it
was
impertinence
too
of
a
kind
of
which
i
had
had
so
much
from
the
city
hall
that
i
decided
the
time
had
come
for
a
demonstration
i
got
me
a
rat
trap
and
prepared
to
catch
one
and
have
it
sent
in
to
the
board
duly
authenticated
by
affidavit
as
hailing
from
allen
street
but
before
i
could
carry
out
my
purpose
the
bottom
fell
out
of
the
tammany
conspiracy
of
ignorance
and
fraud
and
left
us
the
way
clear
for
three
years
so
i
saved
my
rat
for
another
time
this
fact
which
was
naturally
my
own
weapon
the
contribution
i
was
able
to
make
from
my
own
profession
and
training
was
in
reality
a
tremendously
effective
club
before
which
nothing
could
or
can
stand
in
the
long
run
if
i
can
leave
that
conviction
as
a
legacy
to
my
brother
reporters
i
shall
feel
that
i
have
really
performed
a
service
i
believe
they
do
not
half
understand
it
or
they
would
waste
no
printer
ink
idly
the
school
war
was
an
illustration
of
it
all
through
i
was
at
police
headquarters
where
i
saw
the
east
side
that
had
been
orderly
becoming
thievish
and
immoral
going
to
the
schools
i
found
them
overcrowded
ill
ventilated
dark
without
playgrounds
repellent
following
up
the
boys
who
escaped
from
them
in
disgust
if
indeed
they
were
not
barred
out
the
street
swarmed
with
children
for
whom
there
was
not
room
i
saw
them
herded
at
the
prison
to
which
protestant
truants
were
sent
with
burglars
vagrants
thieves
and
bad
boys
of
every
kind
they
classified
them
according
to
size
four
feet
four
feet
seven
and
over
four
feet
seven
no
other
way
was
attempted
at
the
catholic
prison
they
did
not
even
do
that
they
kept
them
on
a
footing
of
social
equality
by
mixing
them
all
up
together
and
when
in
amazement
i
asked
if
that
was
doing
right
by
the
truant
who
might
be
reasonably
supposed
to
be
in
special
danger
from
such
contact
the
answer
i
got
was
would
it
be
fair
to
the
burglar
to
set
him
apart
with
the
stamp
on
him
i
went
back
to
the
office
and
took
from
the
rogues
gallery
a
handful
of
photographs
of
boy
thieves
and
murderers
and
printed
them
in
the
with
a
statement
of
the
facts
under
the
heading
the
making
of
thieves
in
new
york
i
quote
the
concluding
sentence
of
that
article
because
it
seemed
to
me
then
and
it
seems
to
me
now
that
there
was
no
getting
away
from
its
awful
arraignment
while
we
are
asking
at
this
end
of
the
line
if
it
would
be
quite
fair
to
the
burglar
to
shut
him
off
from
social
intercourse
with
his
betters
the
state
reformatory
where
the
final
product
of
our
schools
of
crime
is
garnered
supplies
the
answer
year
after
year
unheeded
of
the
thousands
who
land
there
barely
one
per
cent
kept
good
company
before
coming
all
the
rest
were
the
victims
of
evil
association
of
corrupt
environment
they
were
not
thieves
by
heredity
they
were
made
and
the
manufacture
goes
on
every
day
the
street
and
the
jail
are
the
factories
upon
the
lay
mind
the
argument
took
hold
that
of
the
official
educator
resisted
it
stubbornly
for
a
season
two
years
later
when
one
of
the
school
commissioners
spoke
indulgently
of
the
burglars
and
highway
robbers
in
the
two
prisons
as
probably
guilty
merely
of
the
theft
of
a
top
or
a
marble
or
maybe
a
banana
in
extenuation
of
the
continued
policy
of
his
department
in
sending
truants
there
in
flat
defiance
of
the
state
law
that
forbade
the
mingling
of
thieves
and
truants
the
police
office
had
once
more
to
be
invoked
with
its
testimony
i
had
been
keeping
records
of
the
child
crimes
that
came
up
in
the
course
of
my
work
that
year
they
began
before
the
kindergarten
age
with
burglary
and
highwaymen
at
six
sounds
rather
formidable
but
there
was
no
other
name
for
it
two
lads
of
that
age
had
held
up
a
third
and
robbed
him
in
the
street
at
seven
and
eight
there
were
seven
housebreakers
and
two
common
thieves
at
ten
i
had
a
burglar
one
boy
and
four
girl
thieves
two
charged
with
assault
and
one
with
forgery
at
eleven
four
burglars
two
thieves
with
a
record
two
charged
with
assault
a
highway
robber
an
habitual
liar
and
a
suicide
at
twelve
five
burglars
three
thieves
two
drunks
three
incendiaries
three
arrested
for
assault
and
two
suicides
at
thirteen
five
burglars
one
with
a
record
five
thieves
five
charged
with
assault
one
drunk
one
forger
at
fourteen
four
burglars
seven
thieves
one
drunk
enough
to
fight
a
policeman
six
highway
robbers
and
ten
charged
with
assault
and
so
on
the
street
had
borne
its
perfect
crop
and
they
were
behind
the
bars
every
one
locked
in
with
the
boys
who
had
done
nothing
worse
than
play
hooky
it
was
a
blow
classification
by
measurement
had
ceased
at
the
first
broadside
the
last
gave
us
the
truant
school
which
the
law
demanded
to
make
the
most
of
it
we
shall
apparently
have
to
have
a
new
deal
i
tried
to
persuade
the
children
aid
society
to
turn
its
old
machinery
to
this
new
work
perhaps
the
george
junior
republic
would
do
better
still
when
there
is
room
for
every
boy
on
the
school
bench
and
room
to
toss
a
ball
when
he
is
off
it
there
will
not
be
much
left
of
that
problem
to
wrestle
with
but
little
or
much
the
peril
of
the
prison
is
too
great
to
be
endured
for
a
moment
it
must
have
been
about
that
time
that
i
received
a
letter
from
an
old
friend
who
was
in
high
glee
over
a
statement
in
some
magazine
that
i
had
evolved
a
scientific
theory
as
to
why
boys
go
to
the
bad
in
cities
it
was
plain
that
he
was
as
much
surprised
as
he
was
pleased
and
so
was
i
when
i
heard
what
it
was
all
about
that
which
they
had
pitched
upon
as
science
and
theory
was
the
baldest
recital
of
the
facts
as
seen
from
mulberry
street
beyond
putting
two
and
two
together
there
was
very
little
reasoning
about
it
that
such
conditions
as
were
all
about
us
should
result
in
making
toughs
of
the
boys
was
not
strange
rather
it
would
have
been
strange
had
anything
else
come
of
it
with
the
home
corrupted
by
the
tenement
the
school
doors
closed
against
them
where
the
swarms
were
densest
and
the
children
thrown
upon
the
street
there
to
take
their
chance
with
honest
play
interdicted
every
natural
right
of
the
child
turned
into
a
means
of
oppression
a
game
of
ball
become
a
crime
for
which
children
were
thrust
into
jail
indeed
shot
down
like
dangerous
criminals
when
running
away
from
the
policeman
who
pursued
them
footnote
such
a
case
occurred
on
thanksgiving
day
a
great
public
clamor
arose
and
the
policeman
was
sent
to
sing
sing
with
laws
on
every
hand
breeding
blackmail
and
bringing
the
police
and
authority
into
disrepute
with
the
lawlessness
of
the
street
added
to
want
of
rule
at
home
where
the
immigrant
father
looked
on
helpless
himself
dependent
in
the
strange
surroundings
upon
the
boy
and
no
longer
his
master
it
seemed
as
if
we
had
set
out
to
deliberately
make
the
trouble
under
which
we
groaned
and
we
were
not
alone
in
it
the
shoe
fits
every
large
city
more
or
less
snugly
i
know
for
i
have
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
fitting
it
on
the
last
two
or
three
years
and
often
when
looking
my
audience
over
in
lecturing
about
tony
and
his
hardships
i
am
thinking
about
mulberry
street
and
the
old
days
when
problems
civic
or
otherwise
were
farthest
from
my
mind
in
digging
out
the
facts
that
lay
ready
to
the
hand
of
the
police
reporter
illustration
the
way
to
present
the
manufacture
of
toughs
in
him
as
a
reporter
there
may
be
no
special
virtue
but
there
is
that
in
his
work
in
the
haste
and
the
directness
of
it
which
compels
him
always
to
take
the
short
cut
and
keeps
it
clear
of
crankery
of
every
kind
the
isms
have
no
place
in
a
newspaper
office
certainly
not
in
mulberry
street
i
confess
i
was
rather
glad
of
it
i
had
no
stomach
for
abstract
discussions
of
social
wrongs
i
wanted
to
right
those
of
them
that
i
could
reach
i
wanted
to
tear
down
the
mulberry
bend
and
let
in
the
light
so
that
we
might
the
more
readily
make
them
out
the
others
could
do
the
rest
then
i
used
to
say
that
to
a
very
destructive
crank
who
would
have
nothing
less
upon
any
account
than
the
whole
loaf
my
remedies
were
an
abomination
to
him
the
landlords
should
be
boiled
in
oil
to
a
man
hanging
was
too
good
for
them
now
he
is
a
tammany
officeholder
in
a
position
where
propping
up
landlord
greed
is
his
daily
practice
and
privilege
and
he
thrives
upon
it
but
i
ought
not
to
blame
him
it
is
precisely
because
of
his
kind
that
tammany
is
defenceless
against
real
reform
it
never
can
make
it
out
that
every
man
has
his
price
is
the
language
of
fourteenth
street
they
have
no
dictionary
there
to
enable
them
to
understand
any
other
and
as
a
short
cut
out
of
it
they
deny
that
there
is
any
other
it
helped
me
vastly
that
my
associations
in
the
office
were
most
congenial
i
have
not
often
been
in
accord
with
the
editorial
page
of
my
own
paper
the
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
impossible
for
anybody
to
get
farther
apart
in
their
views
of
most
things
on
the
earth
and
off
it
than
were
my
paper
and
i
it
hated
and
persecuted
beecher
and
cleveland
they
were
my
heroes
it
converted
me
to
grant
by
its
opposition
to
him
the
sign
keep
off
the
grass
arouses
in
its
editorial
breast
no
desire
to
lock
up
the
man
who
planted
it
it
does
in
mine
ten
years
and
more
i
have
striven
in
its
columns
to
make
the
tenement
out
a
chief
device
of
the
devil
and
it
must
be
that
i
have
brought
some
over
to
my
belief
but
i
have
not
converted
the
so
that
on
the
principle
which
i
laid
down
before
that
i
must
be
always
fighting
with
my
friends
i
ought
to
have
had
a
mighty
good
time
of
it
there
and
so
in
fact
i
did
they
let
me
have
in
pretty
nearly
everything
my
own
way
though
it
led
us
so
far
apart
as
time
passed
and
the
duties
that
came
to
me
took
more
and
more
of
my
time
from
my
office
work
i
found
that
end
of
it
insensibly
lightened
to
allow
me
to
pursue
the
things
i
believed
in
though
they
did
not
no
doubt
the
old
friendship
that
existed
between
my
immediate
chief
on
the
william
mccloy
and
myself
bore
a
hand
in
this
yet
it
could
not
have
gone
on
without
the
assent
and
virtual
sympathy
of
the
danas
father
and
son
for
we
came
now
and
then
to
a
point
where
opposite
views
clashed
and
proved
irreconcilable
then
i
found
these
men
whom
some
deemed
cynical
most
ready
to
see
the
facts
as
they
were
and
to
see
justice
done
i
like
to
think
of
my
last
meeting
with
charles
dana
the
old
chief
as
he
was
always
called
in
the
office
in
all
the
years
i
was
on
the
i
do
not
think
i
had
spoken
with
him
a
half
dozen
times
when
he
wanted
anything
of
me
personally
his
orders
were
very
brief
and
to
the
point
it
was
generally
something
a
report
to
be
digested
or
the
story
of
some
social
experiment
which
showed
me
that
in
his
heart
he
was
faithful
to
his
early
love
he
had
been
in
his
youth
as
everybody
knows
an
enthusiastic
reformer
a
member
of
the
brook
farm
community
but
if
he
thought
i
saw
he
let
no
sign
escape
him
he
hated
shams
perhaps
i
was
on
trial
all
the
time
if
so
i
believe
that
he
meant
to
tell
me
in
that
last
that
he
had
not
found
me
wanting
it
was
on
the
stairs
in
the
office
that
we
met
i
was
going
up
he
was
coming
down
going
home
to
die
he
knew
it
in
me
there
was
no
suspicion
of
the
truth
when
i
came
upon
him
at
the
turn
of
the
stairs
stumbling
along
in
a
way
very
unlike
the
usual
springy
step
of
the
old
chief
i
hardly
knew
him
when
he
passed
but
as
he
turned
and
held
out
his
hand
i
saw
that
it
was
dana
looking
somehow
older
than
i
had
ever
seen
him
and
changed
i
took
off
my
hat
and
we
shook
hands
well
he
said
have
you
reformed
everything
to
suit
you
straightened
out
every
kink
in
town
pretty
nearly
i
said
falling
into
his
tone
of
banter
all
except
the
office
that
is
left
yet
and
as
bad
as
ever
ha
he
laughed
you
come
on
we
are
ready
for
you
come
right
along
and
with
another
hearty
he
was
gone
he
never
saw
the
office
again
it
was
the
only
time
he
had
ever
held
out
his
hand
to
me
after
that
first
meeting
of
ours
when
i
was
a
lonely
lad
nearly
thirty
years
before
that
time
there
was
a
dollar
in
it
and
i
spurned
it
this
time
i
like
to
believe
his
heart
was
in
it
and
i
took
it
gladly
and
gratefully
the
police
helped
sometimes
more
frequently
we
were
at
odds
and
few
enough
in
the
rank
and
file
understood
that
i
was
fighting
for
them
in
fighting
the
department
a
friend
came
into
my
office
laughing
one
day
and
told
me
that
he
had
just
overheard
the
doorman
at
police
headquarters
say
as
he
saw
me
pass
ugh
the
hypocrite
see
him
take
off
his
hat
and
then
lay
us
out
cold
in
his
paper
when
he
gets
the
chance
he
referred
to
my
habit
of
raising
the
hat
in
salutation
instead
of
merely
nodding
or
touching
the
brim
no
doubt
he
expressed
a
feeling
that
was
quite
general
at
the
time
but
after
mulberry
street
had
taken
notice
of
roosevelt
friendship
for
me
there
was
a
change
and
then
it
went
to
the
other
extreme
it
never
quite
got
over
the
fact
that
he
did
not
ring
me
in
on
president
mckinley
and
the
government
or
at
least
make
me
his
private
secretary
and
deputy
boss
of
the
empire
state
while
he
was
governor
the
mulberry
street
idea
of
friendship
includes
the
loaves
and
fishes
first
and
last
and
pull
is
the
joss
it
worships
in
fact
i
had
several
times
to
explain
that
roosevelt
had
not
gone
back
on
me
to
save
his
political
reputation
when
at
a
public
meeting
he
once
spoke
of
me
as
his
friend
a
dozen
policemen
brought
me
copies
of
the
paper
containing
the
notice
with
a
frankly
expressed
wish
to
be
remembered
when
i
came
into
my
own
about
that
time
being
in
the
neighborhood
i
strayed
into
the
bend
one
day
to
enjoy
the
sunlight
there
and
the
children
sporting
in
it
at
the
curb
stood
a
big
policeman
leisurely
peeling
an
orange
to
which
he
had
helped
himself
from
a
cringing
italian
cart
i
asked
him
how
were
things
in
the
bend
since
the
park
had
come
he
eyed
me
very
coldly
and
said
bad
very
bad
at
that
i
expressed
my
astonishment
saying
that
i
was
a
reporter
at
police
headquarters
and
had
understood
differently
what
paper
he
grunted
insolently
i
told
him
he
bestowed
a
look
of
mingled
pity
and
contempt
upon
me
nix
mine
friend
he
said
spreading
his
feet
farther
apart
and
tossing
the
peel
at
the
italian
who
grinned
with
delight
at
such
condescension
i
regarded
him
expectantly
he
was
a
very
aggravating
chap
did
you
say
you
were
at
police
headquarters
for
the
sun
he
observed
at
length
yes
he
shook
his
head
nixie
not
guilty
he
said
tauntingly
why
what
do
you
mean
have
you
heard
of
riis
jacob
riis
i
said
i
had
the
governor
friend
yes
what
of
it
well
ai
he
at
headquarters
for
the
i
said
that
was
so
well
i
took
out
my
card
and
handed
it
to
him
i
am
that
man
i
said
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
the
policeman
jaw
dropped
but
he
was
a
thoroughbred
his
heels
came
together
before
as
it
seemed
he
could
have
read
my
name
he
straightened
up
the
orange
fell
from
his
hand
and
rolled
into
the
gutter
covertly
speeded
by
a
dextrous
little
kick
the
unhappy
italian
believing
it
a
mishap
made
haste
to
select
the
biggest
and
juiciest
fruit
on
his
stand
and
held
it
out
with
a
propitiatory
bow
but
he
spurned
him
haughtily
away
these
dagoes
he
said
elaborately
placing
my
card
in
the
of
his
hat
ai
got
no
manners
it
a
hard
place
for
a
good
man
down
here
it
time
i
was
a
roundsman
you
can
do
it
got
de
when
roosevelt
had
gone
to
washington
to
help
fit
out
the
navy
for
the
war
with
spain
i
spent
a
part
of
the
winter
there
with
him
and
mulberry
street
took
it
for
granted
that
i
had
at
last
been
placed
as
i
should
have
been
long
before
there
was
great
amazement
when
i
came
back
to
take
my
old
place
the
truth
was
that
i
had
gone
partly
to
observe
what
went
on
at
the
capital
for
my
paper
and
partly
to
speed
on
the
war
in
which
i
was
a
hearty
believer
from
the
first
it
was
to
me
a
means
first
and
last
of
ending
the
murder
in
cuba
one
of
the
very
earliest
things
i
had
to
do
with
as
a
reporter
was
the
massacre
and
ever
since
it
had
been
bloodshed
right
along
it
was
time
to
stop
it
and
the
only
way
seemed
to
wrest
the
grip
of
spain
from
the
throat
of
the
island
i
think
i
never
quite
got
over
the
contempt
i
conceived
for
spain
and
spanish
ways
when
i
read
as
a
boy
in
hans
christian
account
of
his
travels
in
the
country
of
the
dons
that
the
shepherds
brought
butter
from
the
mountains
in
sheep
intestines
and
measured
them
off
in
lengths
demanded
by
the
customers
by
tying
knots
upon
them
what
was
to
be
expected
from
a
country
that
sold
butter
by
the
yard
as
the
event
showed
it
ran
its
navies
after
the
same
fashion
and
was
justly
punished
i
made
friends
that
winter
with
leonard
wood
whom
we
all
came
to
know
and
admire
afterwards
as
general
and
governor
wood
and
a
fine
fellow
he
was
he
was
roosevelt
friend
and
physician
and
we
spent
many
strenuous
hours
together
being
in
that
mood
for
the
third
time
in
my
life
and
the
last
i
wanted
to
go
to
the
war
when
they
went
and
oh
so
badly
not
to
fight
i
had
had
all
i
needed
of
that
at
home
but
to
tell
the
truth
about
what
was
going
on
in
cuba
the
offered
me
that
post
and
the
agreed
heartily
but
once
more
the
door
was
barred
against
me
two
of
my
children
had
scarlet
fever
my
oldest
son
had
gone
to
washington
trying
to
enlist
with
the
rough
riders
and
the
one
next
in
line
was
engineering
to
get
into
the
navy
on
his
own
hook
my
wife
raised
no
objection
to
my
going
if
it
was
duty
but
her
tears
fell
silently
and
i
stayed
it
was
three
times
and
out
i
shall
never
go
to
the
war
now
unless
in
defence
of
my
own
home
which
may
god
forbid
within
a
year
i
knew
that
had
i
gone
then
i
should
most
likely
not
have
returned
i
had
received
notice
that
to
my
dreams
of
campaigning
in
that
way
there
was
an
end
thankful
that
i
had
been
spared
i
yet
took
leave
of
them
with
a
sigh
most
illogically
for
i
hate
the
sight
of
human
suffering
and
of
brutal
passions
aroused
but
deep
down
in
my
heart
there
is
the
horror
of
my
viking
forefathers
of
dying
in
bed
unable
to
strike
back
as
it
were
i
know
it
is
wicked
and
foolish
but
all
my
life
i
have
so
wished
to
get
on
a
horse
with
a
sword
and
slam
in
just
once
like
another
sheridan
i
who
can
not
sit
on
a
horse
even
the
one
roosevelt
got
me
at
montauk
that
was
warranted
not
to
bite
or
scratch
ran
away
with
me
so
it
is
foolishness
plain
to
see
yet
so
i
might
have
found
out
which
way
i
would
really
have
run
when
the
call
came
i
do
hope
the
right
way
but
i
never
have
felt
quite
sure
the
casualties
of
war
are
not
all
on
the
battlefield
the
cuban
campaign
wrecked
a
promising
career
as
a
foreign
correspondent
which
i
had
been
building
up
for
some
ten
or
fifteen
years
with
toilsome
effort
it
was
for
a
danish
newspaper
i
wrote
with
much
approval
but
when
the
war
came
they
did
not
take
the
same
view
of
things
that
i
did
and
fell
to
suppressing
or
mutilating
my
letters
whereupon
our
connection
ceased
abruptly
my
letters
were
explained
the
editor
to
me
a
year
or
two
later
when
i
saw
him
in
copenhagen
so
er
r
so
youthful
in
their
enthusiasm
that
huh
i
interrupted
him
with
the
remark
that
i
was
glad
we
were
young
enough
yet
in
my
country
to
get
up
and
shout
for
the
flag
in
a
fight
and
left
him
to
think
it
over
they
must
have
aged
suddenly
over
there
for
they
were
not
that
way
when
i
was
a
boy
the
real
fact
was
that
somehow
they
could
not
get
it
into
their
heads
that
a
european
bully
could
be
whipped
in
one
round
by
the
states
they
insisted
on
printing
ridiculous
despatches
about
spanish
victories
i
think
there
was
something
about
codfish
too
something
commercial
about
corks
and
codfish
iceland
keeping
spain
on
a
fish
diet
in
lent
in
return
for
which
she
corked
the
danish
beer
i
have
forgotten
the
particulars
the
bottom
fact
was
a
distrust
of
the
united
states
that
was
based
upon
a
curiously
stubborn
ignorance
entirely
without
excuse
in
a
people
of
high
intelligence
like
the
danes
i
tried
hard
as
a
correspondent
to
draw
a
reasonable
human
picture
of
american
affairs
but
it
seemed
to
make
no
impression
they
would
jump
at
the
munchausen
stories
that
are
always
afloat
as
if
america
were
some
sort
of
menagerie
and
not
a
christian
country
i
think
nothing
ever
aggravated
me
as
did
an
instance
of
that
kind
the
year
ben
butler
ran
for
the
presidency
i
had
been
trying
in
my
letters
to
present
the
political
situation
and
issues
fairly
and
was
beginning
to
feel
that
they
understand
when
i
received
a
copy
of
my
paper
from
copenhagen
and
read
there
a
life
of
general
butler
which
condensed
ran
something
like
this
butler
was
an
ambitious
young
lawyer
shrewd
and
full
of
bold
schemes
for
enriching
himself
when
the
war
with
the
south
broke
out
he
raised
all
the
money
he
could
and
fitted
out
a
fleet
of
privateers
with
this
he
sailed
for
new
orleans
captured
the
city
and
collecting
all
the
silver
spoons
it
contained
freighted
his
vessels
with
them
and
returned
to
the
north
thus
he
laid
the
foundation
for
his
great
fortune
but
achieved
lasting
unpopularity
in
the
south
which
will
prevent
his
election
to
the
presidency
i
am
not
joking
that
was
how
the
story
of
the
silver
spoons
looked
in
danish
a
quarter
of
a
century
after
the
war
really
now
what
would
you
have
done
i
laughed
and
well
made
remarks
by
turns
and
in
the
end
concluded
that
there
was
nothing
else
that
could
be
done
except
buckle
to
and
try
again
which
i
did
if
i
could
not
go
to
the
war
i
could
at
least
go
electioneering
with
roosevelt
when
he
came
back
and
try
to
help
him
out
the
best
i
knew
how
in
matters
that
touched
the
poor
and
their
life
once
he
sat
in
cleveland
chair
in
albany
i
do
not
think
he
felt
that
as
an
added
dignity
but
i
did
and
i
told
him
so
whereat
he
used
to
laugh
a
little
but
there
was
nothing
to
laugh
at
they
are
men
of
the
same
stamp
not
saints
any
more
than
the
rest
of
us
but
men
with
minds
and
honest
wills
if
they
have
different
ways
of
doing
things
i
wish
some
cleveland
would
come
along
again
soon
and
give
me
another
chance
to
vote
the
ticket
which
tammany
obstructs
with
its
impudent
claim
that
it
is
the
democratic
party
as
for
roosevelt
few
were
nearer
to
him
i
fancy
than
i
even
at
albany
no
doubt
he
made
his
mistakes
like
the
rest
of
us
and
when
he
did
there
were
not
wanting
critics
to
make
the
most
of
it
i
wish
they
had
been
half
as
ready
to
lend
him
a
hand
we
might
have
been
farther
on
the
road
then
i
saw
how
faithfully
he
labored
i
was
his
umpire
with
the
tailors
with
the
drug
clerks
in
the
enforcement
of
the
factory
law
against
sweaters
and
i
know
that
early
and
late
he
had
no
other
thought
than
how
best
to
serve
the
people
who
trusted
him
i
want
no
better
governor
than
that
and
i
guess
we
shall
want
him
a
long
time
before
we
get
one
as
good
i
found
out
upon
our
electioneering
tours
that
i
was
not
a
good
especially
on
the
wing
with
stops
of
the
train
it
used
to
pull
out
with
me
inwardly
raging
all
the
good
things
i
meant
to
say
unsaid
the
politicians
knew
that
trick
better
and
i
left
the
field
to
them
speedily
thereafter
i
went
along
just
for
company
only
two
or
three
times
did
i
rise
to
the
occasion
once
when
i
spoke
in
the
square
at
jamestown
where
i
had
worked
as
a
young
lad
and
trapped
muskrats
in
the
creek
for
a
living
the
old
days
came
back
to
me
as
i
looked
upon
that
mighty
throng
and
the
cheers
that
arose
from
it
told
me
that
i
had
caught
on
i
was
wondering
whether
by
any
chance
the
old
ship
captain
who
finished
me
as
a
lecturer
once
was
in
it
but
he
was
not
he
was
dead
another
time
was
in
flushing
long
island
there
was
not
room
in
the
hall
and
they
sent
me
out
to
talk
to
the
crowd
in
the
street
the
sight
of
it
with
the
flickering
torchlight
upon
the
sea
of
upturned
faces
took
me
somehow
as
nothing
ever
had
and
the
speech
i
made
from
the
steps
propped
up
by
two
policemen
took
the
crowd
too
it
cheered
so
that
roosevelt
within
stopped
and
thought
some
enemy
had
captured
the
meeting
when
he
was
gone
with
the
spirit
still
upon
me
i
talked
to
the
meeting
in
the
hall
till
it
rose
and
shouted
my
political
pet
enemy
from
richmond
hill
was
on
the
platform
and
came
over
to
embrace
me
we
have
been
friends
since
the
memory
of
that
evening
lingers
yet
in
flushing
i
am
told
a
picture
from
that
day
trip
through
long
island
will
ever
abide
on
my
mind
the
train
was
about
to
pull
out
from
the
station
in
greenport
when
the
public
school
children
came
swarming
down
to
see
teddy
he
leaned
out
from
the
rear
platform
grasping
as
many
of
the
little
hands
as
he
could
while
the
train
hands
did
their
best
to
keep
the
track
clear
way
back
in
the
jostling
cheering
crowd
i
made
out
the
slim
figure
of
a
pale
freckled
little
girl
in
a
worn
garment
struggling
eagerly
but
hopelessly
to
get
near
him
the
stronger
children
pushed
her
farther
back
and
her
mournful
face
was
nearly
the
last
of
them
all
when
roosevelt
saw
her
going
down
the
steps
even
as
the
train
started
he
made
a
quick
dash
clearing
a
path
through
the
surging
tide
to
the
little
girl
and
taking
her
hand
gave
it
the
heartiest
shake
of
all
then
sprinted
for
the
departing
car
and
caught
it
the
last
i
saw
of
greenport
was
the
poor
little
girl
holding
tight
the
hand
her
hero
had
shaken
with
her
face
all
one
sunbeam
of
joy
i
know
just
how
she
felt
for
i
have
had
the
same
experience
one
of
the
things
i
remember
with
a
pleasure
which
the
years
have
no
power
to
dim
is
my
meeting
with
cardinal
gibbons
some
years
ago
they
had
asked
me
to
come
to
baltimore
to
speak
for
the
fresh
air
fund
and
to
my
great
delight
i
found
that
the
cardinal
was
to
preside
i
had
always
admired
him
at
a
distance
but
during
the
fifteen
minutes
talk
we
had
before
the
lecture
he
won
my
heart
entirely
he
asked
me
to
forgive
him
if
he
had
to
go
away
before
i
finished
my
speech
for
he
had
had
a
very
exhausting
service
the
day
before
and
i
am
an
old
man
on
the
sunny
side
of
sixty
he
added
as
if
in
apology
on
the
shady
side
you
mean
amended
the
presbyterian
clergyman
who
was
on
the
committee
the
cardinal
shook
his
head
smiling
no
doctor
the
sunny
side
nearer
heaven
the
meeting
was
of
a
kind
to
inspire
even
the
dullest
speaker
when
i
finished
my
plea
for
the
children
and
turned
around
there
sat
the
cardinal
yet
behind
me
though
it
was
an
hour
past
his
bedtime
he
came
forward
and
gave
me
his
blessing
then
and
there
i
was
never
so
much
touched
and
moved
even
my
mother
stanch
old
lutheran
that
she
is
was
satisfied
when
i
told
her
of
it
though
in
the
nature
of
things
the
idea
of
her
son
consorting
in
that
way
with
principalities
and
powers
in
the
enemy
camp
must
have
been
a
shock
to
her
speaking
of
which
reminds
me
of
the
one
brief
glimpse
into
the
mysteries
of
the
universe
i
had
while
in
galesburg
the
same
year
i
had
been
lecturing
at
knox
college
of
which
my
friend
john
finley
was
the
president
it
rained
before
the
meeting
but
when
we
came
out
the
stars
shone
brightly
and
i
was
fired
with
a
sudden
desire
to
see
them
through
the
observatory
telescope
the
professor
of
astronomy
took
me
into
the
dark
dome
and
pointed
the
glass
at
saturn
which
i
knew
as
a
scintillating
point
of
light
said
to
be
a
big
round
ball
like
our
earth
and
had
taken
on
trust
as
a
matter
of
course
but
to
see
it
hanging
there
white
and
big
as
an
apple
suspended
within
its
broad
and
shining
ring
was
a
revelation
before
which
i
stood
and
dumb
i
gazed
and
gazed
between
the
star
and
its
ring
i
caught
the
infinite
depth
of
black
space
beyond
i
seemed
to
see
almost
the
whirl
the
motion
to
hear
the
morning
stars
sing
together
and
then
like
a
flash
it
was
gone
crane
my
neck
on
my
ladder
as
i
might
i
could
not
get
sight
of
it
but
where
did
she
go
i
said
half
to
myself
far
down
in
the
darkness
came
the
old
professor
deep
voice
that
time
you
saw
the
earth
move
and
so
i
did
the
clockwork
that
made
the
dome
keep
up
with
the
motion
of
the
stars
of
our
world
rather
had
run
down
and
when
saturn
passed
out
of
my
sight
as
i
thought
it
was
the
earth
instead
which
i
literally
saw
move
and
now
that
i
am
on
my
travels
let
me
cross
the
ocean
long
enough
to
say
that
my
digging
among
the
london
slums
one
summer
only
served
to
convince
me
that
their
problem
is
the
same
as
ours
and
is
to
be
solved
along
the
same
lines
they
have
their
ways
and
we
have
ours
and
each
has
something
to
learn
from
the
other
we
copied
our
law
that
enabled
us
to
tear
down
slum
tenements
from
the
english
statute
under
which
they
cleared
large
areas
over
yonder
long
before
we
got
to
work
and
yet
in
their
poor
streets
in
christian
street
of
all
places
i
found
families
living
in
apartments
entirely
below
the
sidewalk
grade
i
found
children
poisoned
by
factory
fumes
in
a
charitable
fold
and
people
huddled
in
as
i
had
never
seen
it
in
new
york
and
when
i
asked
why
the
police
did
not
interfere
they
looked
at
me
uncomprehending
and
retorted
that
they
were
on
their
own
premises
the
factory
too
and
where
did
the
police
come
in
i
told
them
that
in
new
york
they
came
in
when
and
where
they
saw
fit
and
systematically
in
the
middle
of
the
night
so
that
they
might
get
at
the
exact
facts
as
for
our
we
had
got
rid
of
them
a
long
time
since
by
the
simple
process
of
dragging
out
those
who
would
go
and
shutting
the
cellar
doors
against
them
it
had
to
be
done
and
it
was
done
and
it
settled
the
matter
i
thought
yours
was
a
free
country
said
my
policeman
conductor
so
it
is
i
told
him
freedom
to
poison
yourself
and
your
neighbor
excepted
he
shook
his
head
and
we
went
on
but
these
were
mere
divergences
of
practice
the
principle
is
not
affected
it
was
clear
enough
that
in
london
as
in
new
york
it
was
less
a
question
of
transforming
human
nature
in
the
tenant
than
of
reforming
it
in
the
landlord
at
giles
i
found
side
by
side
with
the
a
church
a
big
bath
and
and
a
school
it
was
the
same
at
seven
dials
at
every
step
it
recalled
the
five
points
to
the
one
as
to
the
other
steeped
in
poverty
and
crime
had
come
the
the
missionary
the
and
let
light
in
together
and
in
their
track
was
following
rather
faster
there
than
here
as
yet
the
housing
reformer
with
his
atoning
scheme
of
philanthropy
and
five
per
cent
that
holds
the
key
in
the
last
analysis
it
is
a
question
of
how
we
rate
the
brotherhood
what
per
cent
we
will
take
my
neighbor
at
table
in
my
london
meant
that
though
he
put
it
in
a
way
all
his
own
he
was
a
benevolent
enough
crank
but
no
friend
of
preaching
being
a
crank
he
condemned
preachers
with
one
fell
swoop
the
parsons
he
said
my
what
hare
they
in
hall
me
life
hi
known
only
two
that
were
fit
to
be
in
the
pulpit
returning
to
my
own
country
i
found
the
conviction
deepening
wherever
the
slum
had
got
a
grip
that
it
was
the
problem
not
only
of
government
but
of
humanity
in
chicago
they
are
setting
limits
to
it
with
parks
and
playgrounds
and
the
home
restored
in
cincinnati
in
cleveland
in
boston
they
are
bestirring
themselves
indeed
in
boston
they
have
torn
down
more
foul
tenements
than
did
we
in
the
metropolis
and
with
less
surrender
to
the
slum
landlord
in
new
york
a
citizens
movement
paved
the
way
for
the
last
commission
which
has
just
finished
its
great
work
and
the
movement
is
warrant
that
the
fruits
of
that
work
will
not
be
lost
listen
to
the
arraignment
of
the
tenement
by
that
commission
appointed
by
the
state
all
the
conditions
which
surround
childhood
youth
and
womanhood
in
new
york
crowded
tenement
quarters
make
for
unrighteousness
they
also
make
for
disease
from
the
tenements
there
comes
a
stream
of
sick
helpless
people
to
our
hospitals
and
dispensaries
from
them
also
comes
a
host
of
paupers
and
charity
seekers
most
terrible
of
all
the
fact
that
mingled
with
the
drunken
the
dissolute
the
improvident
the
diseased
dwell
the
great
mass
of
the
respectable
workingmen
of
the
city
with
their
families
this
after
all
the
work
of
twenty
years
yet
the
work
was
not
wasted
for
at
last
we
see
the
truth
seeing
it
is
impossible
that
the
monstrous
wrong
should
go
unrighted
and
government
of
the
people
endure
as
endure
it
will
i
know
we
have
only
begun
to
find
out
what
it
can
do
for
mankind
in
the
day
when
we
shall
all
think
enough
about
the
common
good
the
to
forget
about
ourselves
in
that
day
too
the
boss
shall
have
ceased
from
troubling
however
gross
he
wax
in
our
sight
he
has
no
real
substance
he
is
but
an
ugly
dream
of
political
distemper
sometimes
when
i
hear
him
spoken
of
with
bated
breath
i
think
of
the
irish
teamster
who
went
to
the
priest
in
a
fright
he
had
seen
a
ghost
on
the
church
wall
as
he
passed
it
in
the
night
and
what
was
it
like
asked
the
priest
it
was
like
nothing
so
much
as
a
big
ass
said
patrick
go
home
pat
and
be
easy
you
seen
your
own
shadow
but
i
am
tired
now
and
want
to
go
home
to
mother
and
rest
awhile
chapter
xv
when
i
went
home
to
mother
there
was
a
heavy
step
on
the
stairs
a
rap
that
sounded
much
as
if
an
elephant
had
knocked
against
the
jamb
in
passing
and
there
in
the
door
stood
a
giant
calmly
surveying
me
as
if
i
were
a
specimen
bug
stuck
on
a
pin
for
inspection
instead
of
an
ordinary
with
no
more
than
two
legs
well
i
said
groping
helplessly
among
the
memories
of
the
past
for
a
clew
to
the
apparition
somewhere
and
sometime
i
had
seen
it
before
that
much
i
knew
and
no
more
the
shape
took
a
step
into
the
room
i
am
jess
it
said
simply
jess
jepsen
from
lustrup
lustrup
i
pushed
back
papers
and
pen
and
strode
toward
the
giant
to
pull
him
up
to
the
light
lustrup
talk
about
seven
league
boots
that
stride
of
mine
was
four
thousand
miles
long
if
it
was
a
foot
it
spanned
the
stormy
atlantic
and
the
cold
north
sea
and
set
me
down
in
sight
of
the
little
village
of
where
i
played
in
the
long
ago
right
by
the
dam
in
the
lazy
brook
where
buttercups
and
nodded
ever
over
the
pool
and
the
pewit
built
its
nest
in
spring
just
beyond
the
brook
issued
forth
from
the
meadows
to
make
a
detour
around
the
sunken
walls
of
the
old
manse
and
lose
itself
in
the
moor
that
stretched
toward
the
western
hills
lustrup
oh
yes
i
pushed
my
giant
into
a
chair
so
that
i
might
have
a
look
at
him
illustration
ribe
in
my
childhood
seen
from
elisabeth
garden
he
was
just
like
the
landscape
of
his
native
plain
big
and
calm
and
honest
nothing
there
to
hide
could
if
it
tried
and
like
his
village
he
smelled
of
the
he
was
a
driver
he
told
me
earning
wages
but
he
had
his
evenings
to
himself
and
so
he
had
come
to
find
through
me
a
school
where
he
might
go
and
learn
english
just
so
it
was
lustrup
all
over
i
remembered
as
though
it
were
yesterday
the
time
i
went
up
to
have
a
look
at
the
dam
i
had
seen
for
thirty
years
and
the
and
the
pewit
so
anxiously
solicitous
for
her
young
and
found
the
brook
turned
aside
and
the
western
of
the
manse
which
it
skirted
all
gone
and
the
story
the
big
farmer
jess
jepsen
father
told
me
with
such
quiet
pride
standing
there
of
how
because
of
trouble
made
by
the
germans
at
the
line
a
mile
away
the
cattle
business
had
run
down
and
down
until
the
farm
did
pay
how
he
and
the
boy
unaided
working
patiently
year
by
year
with
spade
and
shovel
had
dug
down
the
nine
acres
of
dry
upland
moved
the
wall
into
the
bottoms
and
turned
the
brook
making
green
meadow
of
the
sandy
barren
and
saving
the
farm
the
toil
of
twenty
years
had
broken
the
old
man
body
but
his
spirit
was
undaunted
as
ever
there
was
a
gleam
of
triumph
in
his
eye
as
he
shook
his
fist
at
the
line
post
on
the
causeway
we
beat
them
he
said
we
did
they
did
i
had
heard
it
told
many
times
how
this
brave
little
people
driven
out
of
the
german
market
had
conquered
the
english
and
held
it
against
the
world
three
times
in
one
man
lifetime
making
a
new
front
to
changed
industrial
conditions
turning
from
to
cattle
on
the
hoof
again
to
slaughtered
meat
and
once
more
to
and
holding
always
their
own
how
robbed
of
of
their
country
by
a
faithless
foe
they
had
set
about
with
indomitable
energy
to
reclaim
the
arid
moor
and
in
one
generation
laid
under
the
plough
or
planted
as
woodland
as
great
an
area
as
that
which
had
been
stolen
from
them
ay
it
was
a
brave
record
a
story
to
make
one
proud
of
being
of
such
a
people
i
too
heard
the
pewit
plaint
in
my
childhood
and
caught
the
in
the
brook
i
was
a
boy
when
they
planted
the
black
post
at
the
line
and
watered
it
with
the
blood
of
my
countrymen
and
with
roots
in
a
foreign
soil
i
dream
with
them
yet
of
the
day
that
shall
see
it
pulled
up
and
hurled
over
the
river
where
my
fathers
beat
back
the
southern
tide
a
thousand
years
jess
he
went
away
satisfied
he
will
be
there
when
needed
his
calm
eyes
warranted
that
and
i
i
went
back
to
the
old
home
to
denmark
and
to
my
mother
because
i
just
could
stay
away
any
longer
we
had
wandered
through
holland
counting
the
windmills
studying
the
explications
set
forth
in
painfully
elaborate
english
on
its
old
church
walls
with
the
information
for
travellers
that
further
particulars
were
to
be
obtained
of
the
sexton
who
might
be
found
with
the
key
in
the
neighborhood
no
we
had
argued
with
the
keeper
of
the
prinzenhof
in
delft
that
william
the
silent
could
not
possibly
have
been
murdered
as
he
said
he
was
that
he
must
have
come
down
the
stairs
and
not
gone
across
the
hall
when
the
assassin
shot
him
as
any
new
york
police
reporter
could
tell
from
the
that
is
yet
in
the
wall
and
thereby
wounding
his
patriotic
pride
so
deeply
that
an
extra
fee
was
required
to
soothe
it
i
caught
him
looking
after
us
as
we
went
down
the
street
and
shaking
his
head
at
those
wild
americans
who
accounted
nothing
holy
not
even
the
official
record
of
murder
done
while
their
ancestors
were
yet
savages
roaming
the
plains
we
had
laughed
at
the
on
the
frontier
carrying
coal
in
baskets
up
a
ladder
to
the
waiting
engine
and
emptying
it
into
the
fender
and
now
after
parting
company
with
my
at
hamburg
i
was
nearing
the
land
where
once
more
i
should
see
old
dannebrog
the
flag
that
fell
from
heaven
with
victory
to
the
danes
literally
out
of
the
sky
it
fell
in
their
sight
the
historic
fact
being
apparently
that
the
christian
bishops
had
put
up
a
job
with
the
pope
to
wean
the
newly
converted
danes
away
from
their
heathen
pirate
flag
and
found
their
opportunity
in
one
of
the
crusades
the
danes
undertook
on
their
own
hook
into
what
is
now
prussia
the
pope
had
sent
a
silken
banner
with
the
device
of
a
white
cross
in
red
and
at
the
right
moment
when
the
other
was
taken
the
priest
threw
it
down
from
a
cliff
into
the
thick
of
the
battle
and
turned
its
tide
ever
after
it
was
the
flag
of
the
danes
and
their
german
foes
had
reason
to
hate
it
here
in
slesvig
through
which
i
was
travelling
to
display
it
was
good
cause
for
banishment
but
over
yonder
behind
the
black
post
it
was
waiting
and
my
heart
leaped
to
meet
it
have
i
not
felt
the
thrill
when
wandering
abroad
at
the
sight
of
the
stars
and
stripes
suddenly
unfolding
the
flag
of
my
home
of
my
manhood
years
and
of
my
pride
happy
he
who
has
a
flag
to
love
twice
blest
he
who
has
two
and
such
two
we
have
yet
a
mile
to
the
frontier
and
with
the
panorama
of
green
meadows
of
placid
rivers
and
of
storks
gravely
patrolling
the
marshes
in
search
of
frogs
and
lizards
passing
by
our
i
can
stop
to
tell
you
how
this
filial
pride
in
the
flag
of
my
fathers
once
betrayed
me
into
the
hands
of
the
philistines
it
was
in
london
during
the
wedding
of
the
duke
of
york
the
king
and
queen
of
denmark
were
in
town
and
wherever
one
went
was
the
danish
flag
hung
out
in
their
honor
riding
under
one
on
top
of
a
holborn
bus
i
asked
a
cockney
in
the
seat
next
to
mine
what
flag
it
was
i
wanted
to
hear
him
praise
it
that
was
why
i
pretended
not
to
know
he
surveyed
it
with
the
calm
assurance
of
his
kind
and
made
reply
that
ah
yes
it
is
the
sign
of
john
hambulance
corps
the
haccident
flag
do
you
know
and
he
pointed
to
an
ambulance
officer
just
passing
with
the
cross
device
on
his
arm
the
dannebrog
the
haccident
flag
what
did
i
do
what
would
you
have
done
i
just
fumed
and
suppressed
as
well
as
i
could
a
desire
to
pitch
that
cockney
into
the
crowds
below
with
his
pipe
and
his
miserable
ignorance
but
i
had
to
go
down
to
do
it
but
there
is
the
hoary
tower
of
the
old
domkirke
in
which
i
was
baptized
and
confirmed
and
married
rising
out
of
the
broad
fields
and
all
the
familiar
landmarks
rushing
by
and
now
the
train
is
slowing
up
for
the
station
and
a
chorus
of
voices
shout
out
the
name
of
the
wanderer
there
is
mother
in
the
throng
with
the
glad
tears
streaming
down
her
dear
old
face
and
half
the
town
come
out
to
see
her
bring
home
her
boy
every
one
of
them
sharing
her
joy
to
the
very
who
brought
her
his
letters
these
many
years
and
has
grown
fairly
to
be
a
member
of
the
family
in
the
doing
of
it
at
last
the
waiting
is
over
and
her
faith
justified
dear
old
mother
i
return
sadly
scotched
in
many
a
conflict
with
the
world
yet
ever
thy
boy
thy
home
mine
ah
me
heaven
is
nearer
to
us
than
we
often
dream
on
earth
illustration
at
home
in
the
old
town
the
last
time
we
were
all
together
how
shall
i
tell
you
of
the
old
town
by
the
north
sea
that
was
the
home
of
the
danish
kings
in
the
days
when
kings
led
their
armies
afield
and
held
their
crowns
by
the
strength
of
their
grip
shall
i
paint
to
you
the
queer
crooked
streets
with
their
cobblestone
pavements
and
houses
where
the
swallow
builds
in
the
hall
and
the
stork
on
the
witness
both
that
peace
dwells
within
for
it
is
well
known
that
the
stork
will
not
abide
with
a
divided
house
and
as
for
the
swallow
a
plague
of
boils
awaits
the
graceless
hand
that
disturbs
its
nest
when
the
saviour
hung
upon
the
cross
did
it
not
perch
upon
the
beam
and
pour
forth
its
song
of
love
and
pity
to
his
dying
ear
soothe
him
soothe
him
the
stork
from
the
meadow
cried
strength
him
strength
him
but
the
wicked
pewit
beholding
the
soldiers
with
their
spears
cried
pierce
him
pierce
him
hence
stork
and
swallow
are
the
friends
of
man
while
the
pewit
dwells
in
exile
fleeing
ever
from
his
presence
with
its
lonesome
cry
will
you
wander
with
me
through
the
fields
where
the
gentian
blooms
with
the
pink
and
the
bridal
torch
nods
from
the
bending
its
stately
head
to
the
west
wind
that
sweeps
ever
in
from
the
sea
with
touch
as
soft
as
of
a
hand
flat
and
uninteresting
yes
if
you
will
if
one
sees
only
the
fields
my
children
saw
them
and
longed
back
to
the
hills
of
long
island
and
in
their
cold
looks
i
felt
the
tugging
of
the
chain
which
he
must
bear
through
life
who
exiled
himself
from
the
land
of
his
birth
however
near
to
his
heart
that
of
his
choice
and
his
adoption
i
played
in
these
fields
when
i
was
a
boy
i
fished
in
these
streams
and
built
fires
on
their
banks
in
spring
to
roast
potatoes
in
the
like
of
which
i
have
never
tasted
since
here
i
lay
dreaming
of
the
great
and
beautiful
world
without
watching
the
skylark
soar
ever
higher
with
its
song
of
triumph
and
joy
and
here
i
learned
the
sweet
lesson
of
love
that
has
echoed
its
jubilant
note
through
all
the
years
and
will
until
we
reach
the
golden
gate
she
and
i
to
which
love
holds
the
key
uninteresting
say
you
so
but
linger
here
with
me
casting
for
pickerel
among
the
until
the
sun
sets
red
and
big
over
the
sea
yonder
and
you
shall
see
a
light
upon
these
meadows
where
the
grass
is
as
fine
silk
that
is
almost
as
if
it
were
not
of
earth
and
as
we
walk
home
through
the
long
northern
twilight
listening
to
the
curlew
distant
call
with
the
browsing
sheep
looming
large
against
the
horizon
upon
the
green
hill
where
stood
the
old
kings
castle
and
the
gray
dom
rearing
its
lofty
head
over
their
graves
teeming
with
memories
of
centuries
gone
and
past
you
shall
learn
to
know
the
poetry
of
this
danish
summer
that
holds
the
hearts
of
its
children
with
such
hoops
of
steel
at
the
south
gate
the
gossip
benches
are
filled
the
old
men
smoke
their
pipes
and
doff
their
caps
to
the
american
with
the
cheery
welcome
of
friends
who
knew
and
spanked
him
with
hearty
good
will
when
as
a
kid
he
absconded
with
their
boats
for
a
surreptitious
expedition
up
to
the
lake
those
boats
heavy
propelled
with
a
pole
that
stuck
in
the
mud
and
pulled
them
back
half
the
time
farther
than
they
had
gone
but
what
fun
it
was
in
after
years
a
steam
whistle
woke
the
echoes
of
these
quiet
waters
it
was
the
first
one
and
the
last
the
railroad
indeed
came
to
town
long
after
i
had
grown
to
be
a
man
and
a
interjected
its
bustle
into
the
drowsy
hum
of
the
waterwheels
that
had
monopolized
the
industry
of
the
tovn
before
disturbing
its
harmony
for
a
season
but
the
steamboat
had
no
successors
illustration
the
gossip
benches
are
filled
the
river
that
had
once
borne
large
ships
gradually
sanded
up
at
the
mouth
and
nothing
heavier
than
a
lighter
has
come
up
in
the
memory
of
man
to
the
quay
where
grass
grows
high
among
the
cobblestones
and
the
lone
customs
official
smokes
his
pipe
all
day
long
in
unbroken
peace
the
steamer
was
a
launch
of
the
smallest
it
had
been
brought
across
country
on
a
wagon
some
one
had
bought
it
at
an
auction
for
a
lark
and
a
huge
lark
was
its
year
on
the
waters
of
the
nibs
river
the
whole
town
took
a
sail
in
it
by
turns
always
with
one
aft
whose
business
it
was
to
disentangle
the
rudder
from
the
mass
of
seaweed
which
with
brief
intervals
suspended
progress
and
all
hands
ready
to
get
out
and
lift
the
steamer
off
when
it
ran
on
a
bank
there
came
a
day
when
a
more
than
commonly
ambitious
excursion
was
undertaken
even
to
the
islands
in
the
sea
some
six
or
seven
miles
from
the
town
the
town
council
set
out
upon
the
journey
with
the
rector
of
the
latin
school
and
the
burgomaster
bargaining
for
dinner
on
their
return
at
dusk
but
it
was
destined
that
those
islands
should
remain
undiscovered
by
steam
and
the
dinner
uneaten
barely
outside
the
tide
left
it
high
and
dry
upon
the
sands
it
was
then
those
danes
showed
what
stuff
there
was
in
them
the
water
would
not
be
back
to
lift
them
off
for
six
hours
and
more
they
indulged
in
no
lamentations
but
sturdily
produced
the
schnapps
and
sandwiches
without
which
no
dane
is
easily
to
be
tempted
out
of
sight
of
his
home
the
rector
evolved
a
pack
of
cards
from
the
depths
of
his
coat
pocket
and
upon
the
sandbank
the
party
camped
playing
a
cheerful
game
of
whist
until
the
tide
came
back
and
bore
them
home
the
night
comes
on
the
people
are
returning
from
their
evening
constitutional
walking
in
the
middle
of
the
street
and
taking
off
their
hats
to
their
neighbors
as
they
pass
it
is
their
custom
and
the
american
habit
of
nodding
to
friends
is
held
to
be
evidence
of
backwoods
manners
excusable
only
in
a
people
so
new
in
the
deep
recesses
of
the
domkirke

shadows
are
gathering
the
tower
clock
peals
forth
at
the
last
stroke
the
watchman
lifts
up
his
chant
in
a
voice
that
comes
quavering
down
from
bygone
ages

ho
watchman
heard
ye
the
clock
strike
ten
this
hour
is
worth
the
know

ye
high

our
clock
just
now
struck
ten
i
shall
take
his
advice
but
first
i
must
go
to
the
to
get
a
box
of
polish
for
my
russet
shoes
unexpectedly
i
found
it
for
sale
there
i
strike
the
storekeeper
in
an
ungracious
mood
he
objects
to
being
bothered
about
business
just
when
he
is
shutting
up
shop
there
he
says
handing
me
the
desired
box
only
one
more
left
i
shall
presently
have
to
send
for
more
twice
already
have
i
been
put
to
that
trouble
i
do
know
what
has
come
over
the
town
and
he
slams
down
the
shutter
with
a
fretful
jerk
i
grope
my
way
home
in
egyptian
darkness
thanking
in
my
heart
the
town
council
for
its
forethought
in
painting
the
white
it
was
when
a
dispute
sprang
up
about
the
price
of
gas
or
something
danish
disputes
are
like
the
law
the
world
over
slow
of
gait
and
it
was
in
no
spirit
of
mockery
that
a
resolution
was
passed
to
paint
the
white
pending
the
controversy
so
that
the
good
people
in
the
town
might
avoid
running
against
them
in
the
dark
and
getting
hurt
if
by
any
mischance
they
strayed
from
the
middle
of
the
road
illustration
the
extinct
bright
and
early
the
next
morning
i
found
women
at
work
sprinkling
white
sand
in
the
street
in
front
of
my
door
and
strewing
it
with
and
twigs
of
hemlock
some
one
was
dead
and
the
funeral
was
to
pass
that
way
indeed
they
all
did
the
cemetery
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
street
it
was
one
of
the
inducements
held
out
to
my
mother
she
told
me
when
father
died
to
move
from
the
old
home
into
that
street
now
that
she
was
quite
alone
it
was
so
nice
and
lively
all
the
funerals
passed
by
the
one
buried
that
day
i
had
known
or
she
had
known
me
in
my
boyhood
and
it
was
expected
that
i
would
attend
my
mother
sent
the
wreath
that
belongs
there
is
both
sense
and
sentiment
in
flowers
at
a
funeral
when
they
are
wreathed
by
the
hands
of
those
who
loved
the
dead
as
is
still
the
custom
here
none
where
they
are
bought
at
a
and
paid
for
with
a
growl
and
we
stood
around
the
coffin
and
sang
the
old
hymns
then
walked
behind
it
two
by
two
men
and
women
to
the
grave
singing
as
we
passed
through
the
gate
earth
to
earth
ashes

ashes

the
clods
rang
upon
the
coffin
with
almost
cheerful
sound
for
she
whose
mortal
body
lay
within
was
full
of
years
and
very
tired
the
minister
paused
from
among
the
mourners
came
forth
the
nearest
relative
and
stood
by
the
grave
hat
in
hand
ours
were
all
off
from
my
heart
i
thank
you
neighbors
all
he
said
and
it
was
over
we
waited
to
shake
hands
to
speculate
on
the
weather
safe
topic
even
at
funerals
then
went
each
to
his
own
i
went
down
by
the
cloister
walk
and
sat
upon
a
bench
and
thought
of
it
all
the
stork
had
built
its
nest
there
on
the
stump
of
a
broken
tree
and
was
hatching
its
young
the
big
bird
stood
on
one
leg
and
looked
down
upon
me
out
of
its
grave
unblinking
eye
as
it
did
forty
years
ago
when
we
children
sang
to
it
in
the
street
the
song
about
the
pyramids
and
pharaoh
land
the
town
lay
slumbering
in
the
sunlight
and
the
blossoming
elders
the
far
tinkle
of
a
bell
came
sleepily
over
the
hedges
once
upon
a
time
it
called
the
monks
to
prayers
ashes
to
ashes
they
are
gone
and
buried
with
the
dead
past
it
summons
the
latin
school
boys
to
recitations
i
shuddered
at
the
thought
they
had
at
the
school
when
the
bell
called
me
with
the
rest
a
wretched
tradition
that
some
king
had
once
expressed
wonder
at
the
many
learned
men
who
came
from
the
latin
school
and
the
rector
told
him
why
illustration
the
ancient
bellwoman
we
have
near
here
he
said
a
little
birch
forest
it
helps
your
majesty
it
helps
faithfully
did
it
play
its
part
in
my
day
though
i
can
not
bear
witness
that
it
helped
but
its
day
passed
too
and
is
gone
the
world
moves
and
all
the
while
forward
not
always
with
the
speed
of
the
wind
but
it
moves

collecting
rounds

his
cart
has
stopped
at
the
bleaching
yard
where
his
wife
and
little
boy
are
hanging
out

lights
his
pipe
and
after
a
brief
rest
to
take
breath
turns
to
helping
the
hang
the
things
on
the
line
then
he
packs
the
dry
clothes
in
his
cart
puts
the
boy
in
with
them
and
puffing
leisurely
at
his
pipe
lounges
soberly
homeward
there
is
no

with

mail
there
is
not
it
was
only
yesterday
that
crossing
the
meadows
on
a
local
i
found
the
train
pulling
up
some
distance
from
the
village
to
let
an
old
woman
coming
puffing
and
blowing
from
a
with
a
basket
on
her
arm
catch
up
well

can
she
hurry
a
bit
spake
the
conductor
when
she
came
within
hearing
they
address
one
another
in
the
third
person
out
of
a
sort
of
neighborly
regard
it
appears
now
sonny
responded
the
old
woman
as
she
lumbered
on
board
do
i
run
as
fast
as
i
can
and
has
she
got
her
fare
now
queried
the
conductor
why
no
sonny
how
should
i
have
that
till
i
been
in
to
sell
my
eggs
and
she
held
up
the
basket
in
token
of
good
faith
well
well
growled
the
other
see
to
it
that
she
does
forget
to
pay
it
when
she
comes
back
and
the
train
went
on
time
to
wait
the
deckhand
on
the
lifts
his
hat
and
bids
you
god
speed
as
you
pass

for
the
conductor
to
hear
the
account
of
that
last
baby
and
his
assurance
that
the
mother
is
doing

between

messenger

goes
back
home
with
him
to
hear
the
news

would
not
be

to
break
it
in

street
i
remember
once
coming
down
the
chain
of
lakes
in
the
jutland
peninsula
on
a
steamer
that
stopped
at
an
landing
where
no

made
out
though
hastening
down
a
path
that
lost
itself
in
the
woods
a
long
way
off
the
captain
waited
as
she
stepped
aboard
another
woman
appeared
in
the
dim
distance
running
too
he
blew
his
whistle
to
tell
her
he
was
waiting
but
said
nothing
when
she
was
quite
near
the
steamer
a
third
woman
turned
into
the
path
bound
too
for
the
landing
i
looked
on
in
some
fear
lest
the
steamboat
man
should
lose
his
temper
at
length
but
not
he
it
was
only
when
a
fourth
and
last
woman
appeared
like
a
whirling
speck
in
the
distance
with
the
three
aboard
making
frantic
signals
to
her
to
hurry
that
he
showed
signs
of
impatience
could
she
he
said
with
some
asperity
as
she
flounced
aboard
could
she
get
here
sooner
illustration
the
village
express
no
she
said
i
could
did
you
see
me
run
and
he
rang
the
bell
to
start
the
boat
time
to
wait
in
new
york
i
have
seen
men
in
the
days
before
the
iron
gates
were
put
on
the
jump
when
the
boat
was
yet
a
yard
from
the
landing
and
run
as
if
their
lives
depended
on
it
then
meeting
an
acquaintance
in
the
street
stop
and
chat
ten
minutes
with
him
about
nothing
how
much
farther
did
they
get
than
these
when
all
denmark
was
torn
up
last
summer
by
a
strike
that
involved
of
the
working
population
and
extended
through
many
months
to
the
complete
blocking
of
all
industries
not
a
blow
was
struck
or
an
ill
word
spoken
during
all
the
time
determined
as
both
sides
were
no
troops
or
extra
police
were
needed
the
strikers
used
the
time
to
attend
university
extension
lectures
visit
museums
and
learn
something
useful
the
people
including
many
of
the
employers
contributed
liberally
to
keep
them
from
starving
it
was
a
war
of
principles
and
it
was
fought
out
on
that
line
though
in
the
end
each
gave
in
to
something
yes
it
is
good
sometimes
to
take
time
to
think
even
if
you
can
not
wait
for
the
tide
to
float
you
off
a
sandbank
though
what
else
they
could
have
done
i
can
not
imagine
that
night
there
was
a
great
in
the
old
town
the
target
company
had
its
annual
shoot
and
the
target
company
included
all
of
the
solid
citizens
of
the
town
the
king
who
had
made
the
best
score
was
escorted
with
a
band
to
the
hotel
on
the
square
opposite
the
dom
and
made
a
speech
from
a
window
adorned
with
the
green
sash
of
his
office
and
flanked
by
ten
tallow
dips
by
way
of
illumination
and
the
people
cheered
yes
it
was
petty
and
provincial
and
all
that
but
it
was
pleasant
and
neighborly
and
oh
how
good
for
a
tired
man
when
i
was
rested
i
journeyed
through
the
islands
to
find
old
friends
and
found
them
the
heartiness
of
the
welcome
that
met
me
everywhere
no
need
of
their
telling
me
they
were
glad
to
see
me
it
shone
out
of
their
faces
and
all
over
them
i
shall
always
remember
that
journey
the
people
in
the
cars
that
were
forever
lunching
and
urging
me
to
join
in
though
we
had
never
met
before
were
we
not
how
then
could
we
be
strangers
and
when
they
learned
i
was
from
new
york
the
inquiries
after
hans
or
fritz
somewhere
in
nebraska
or
dakota
had
i
ever
met
them
and
if
i
did
would
i
tell
them
i
had
seen
father
mother
or
brother
and
that
they
were
well
and
would
i
come
and
stay
with
them
a
day
or
two
it
was
with
very
genuine
regret
that
i
had
mostly
to
refuse
my
vacation
could
not
last
forever
as
it
was
i
packed
it
full
enough
to
last
me
for
many
summers
of
all
sorts
of
things
too
shall
i
ever
forget
that
ride
on
the
stage
up
the
from
elsinore
which
i
made
outside
with
the
driver
a
farmer
who
had
conscientious
scruples
so
it
seemed
against
passing
any
vehicle
on
the
road
and
preferred
to
take
the
dust
of
them
all
until
we
looked
like
a
pair
of
dusty
millers
up
there
on
the
box
to
my
protests
he
turned
an
incredulous
ear
remarking
only
that
there
was
always
some
one
ahead
which
was
a
fact
when
at
last
we
drew
near
our
destination
he
found
himself
a
passenger
short
after
some
puzzled
inquiry
of
the
rest
he
came
back
and
mounting
to
his
seat
beside
me
said
quietly
one
of
them
fell
out
on
his
head
they
say
down
the
road
i
had
him
to
deliver
at
the
inn
but
it
ca
be
blamed
on
me
can
it
he
was
not
the
only
philosopher
in
that
company
inside
rode
two
passengers
one
apparently
an
official
sheriff
or
something
the
other
a
doctor
who
debated
all
the
way
the
propriety
of
uniforming
the
physician
in
attendance
upon
executions
the
sheriff
evidently
considered
such
a
step
an
invasion
of
his
official
privilege
why
cried
the
doctor
it
is
almost
impossible
now
to
tell
the
difference
between
the
doctor
and
the
delinquent
ah
well
sighed
the
other
placidly
settling
back
in
his
seat
just
let
them
once
take
the
wrong
man
then
we
shall
see
through
forest
and
field
over
hill
and
vale
by
the
still
waters
where
far
islands
lay
shimmering
upon
the
summer
sea
like
floating
into
the
deep
gloomy
moor
went
my
way
the
moor
was
ever
most
to
my
liking
i
was
born
on
the
edge
of
it
and
once
its
majesty
has
sunk
into
a
human
soul
that
soul
is
forever
after
attuned
to
it
how
little
we
have
the
making
of
ourselves
and
how
much
greater
the
need
that
we
should
make
of
that
little
the
most
all
my
days
i
have
been
preaching
against
heredity
as
the
of
hope
and
effort
and
here
is
mine
holding
me
fast
when
i
see
rising
out
of
the
dark
moor
the
lonely
cairn
that
sheltered
the
bones
of
my
fathers
before
the
white
christ
preached
peace
to
their
land
a
great
yearning
comes
over
me
there
i
want
to
lay
mine
there
i
want
to
sleep
under
the
heather
where
the
bees
hum
drowsily
in
the
purple
broom
at
noonday
and
white
shadows
walk
in
the
night
mist
from
the
marshes
they
are
but
the
people
think
them
wraiths
half
heathen
yet
am
i
yes
if
to
yearn
for
the
soil
whence
you
sprang
is
to
be
a
heathen
heathen
am
i
not
half
but
whole
and
will
be
all
my
days
but
not
so
he
is
the
heathen
who
loves
not
his
native
land
thor
long
since
lost
his
grip
on
the
sons
of
the
vikings
over
the
battlefield
he
drives
his
chariot
yet
and
his
hammer
strikes
fire
as
of
old
the
british
remember
it
from
nelson
raid
on
copenhagen
the
germans
felt
it
in
and
again
when
in
the
fight
for
very
life
the
little
country
held
its
own
a
whole
winter
against
two
great
powers
on
rapine
bent
felt
it
at
helgoland
where
its
sailors
scattered
their
navies
and
drove
them
from
the
sea
beaten
yet
never
did
the
white
christ
work
greater
transformation
in
a
people
once
so
fierce
now
so
gentle
unless
when
fighting
for
its
firesides
forest
and
field
teem
with
legends
that
tell
of
it
tell
of
the
battle
between
the
old
and
the
new
and
the
victory
of
peace
every
hilltop
bears
witness

holy
andrew
cross
here
by
the
wayside
stands
a
wooden
cross
all
the
knows
the
story
of
holy
andrew
the
priest
whose
piety
wrought
miracles
far
and
near
once
upon
a
time
runs
the
legend
he
went
on
a
pilgrimage
to
the
holy
land
and
was
left
behind
by
his
companions
because
he
would
not
sail
be
wind
and
tide
ever
so
fair
without
first
going
to
mass
to
pray
for
a
safe
journey
when
his
devotions
ended
he
went
to
the
dock
he
saw
only
the
sail
of
the
departing
craft
sinking
below
the
horizon
overcome
by
grief
and
loneliness
he
stood
watching
it
thinking
of
friends
at
home
whom
he
might
never
again
see
when
a
horseman
reined
in
his
steed
and
bade
him
mount
with
him
he
would
see
him
on
his
way
andrew
did
and
fell
asleep
in
the
stranger
arms
when
he
awoke
he
lay
on
this
hill
where
the
cross
has
stood
ever
since
heard
the
cattle
low
and
saw
the
spire
of
his
church
in
the
village
where
the
vesper
bells
were
ringing
many
months
went
by
before
his
reached
home
holy
andrew
lived
six
hundred
years
ago
a
masterful
man
was
he
beside
a
holy
one
who
bluntly
told
the
king
the
truth
when
he
needed
it
and
knew
how
to
ward
the
faith
and
the
church
committed
to
his
keeping
by
such
were
the
old
rovers
weaned
from
their
wild
life
what
a
mark
he
left
upon
his
day
is
shown
yet
by
the
tradition
that
disaster
impends
if
the
cross
is
allowed
to
fall
into
decay
once
when
it
was
neglected
the
broke
out
in
the
parish
and
ceased
says
the
story
not
until
it
was
restored
when
right
away
there
was
an
end
holy
andrew
church
still
stands
over
yonder
not
that
one
with
the
twin
towers
that
has
another
story
to
tell
one
that
was
believed
to
be
half
or
wholly
legend
too
until
a
recent
restoration
of
it
brought
to
light
under
the
whitewash
of
the
reformation
mural
paintings
which
furnished
the
lacking
proof
that
it
was
all
true
it
was
in
the
days
of
holy
andrew
that
the
pious
knight
sir
asker
ryg
going
to
the
war
told
the
lady
inge
to
build
a
new
church
the
tells
what
was
the
matter
with
the
old
one
with
wall
of
clay
and
grim
the
wall
it
was
mouldy
and
foul
and
green
and
rent
with
a
crack
full
deep
time
gnaweth
ever
with
sharper
tooth
leaves
little
to
mend
i
ween
nothing
was
left
to
mend
in
the
church
of
fjenneslev
so
she
must
build
a
new
it
is
not
fitting
says
the
knight
in
the
song
to
pray
to
god
in
such
a
broken
wrack
the
wind
blows
in
and
the
rain
drips
christ
has
gone
to
his
heavenly
home
no
more
a
manger
beseems
him
and
he
whispers
to
her
at
the
an
thou
bearest
to
our
house
a
boy
build
a
tower
upon
the
church
if
a
daughter
come
build
but
a
spire
a
man
must
fight
his
way
but
humility
becomes
a
woman
then
the
fight
and
the
return
with
victory
the
impatient
ride
that
left
all
the
rest
behind
as
they
neared
home
the
unspoken
prayer
of
the
knight
as
he
bent
his
head
over
the
riding
up
the
hill
over
the
edge
of
which
the
church
must
presently
appear
that
it
might
be
a
tower
and
his
sly
laugh
when
it
comes
into
view
with
two
towers
for
one
well
might
he
laugh
those
twin
brothers
became
the
makers
of
danish
history
in
its
heroic
age
the
one
a
mighty
captain
the
other
a
great
bishop
king

fought

there
was

as
well
with

as
with

the
country

to
the
core
it
was
his
clerk
saxo

grammaticus

of
his
learning

gave
to
the
world
the
collection
of
chronicles

which
we
owe
our
hamlet

sir
asker
ryg
church
at
fjennesloevlille
the
church
stands
there
with
its
two
towers
they
made
haste
to
restore
them
when
they
read
in
the
paintings
the
story
of
sir
asker
return
and
gratitude
just
as
tradition
had
handed
it
down
from
the
twelfth
century
it
is
not
the
first
time
the
loyal
faith
of
the
people
has
proved
a
better
guide
than
carping
critics
and
likely
it
will
not
be
the
last
illustration
i
rediscovered
on
that
trip
the
ancient
bellwoman
sole
advertising
medium
before
the
advent
of
the
the
extinct
the
ornamental
policeman
who
for
professional
excitement
reads
detective
novels
at
home
and
the
sacrificial
rites
of
of
what
or
whom
i
shall
leave
unsaid
but
it
must
have
been
an
unconscious
survival
of
something
of
the
sort
that
prompted
the
butcher
to
adorn
with
gay
ribbons
the
poor
nag
led
to
the
slaughter
in
the
wake
of
the
town
drummer
he
designed
it
as
an
advertisement
that
there
would
be
fresh
for
sale
that
day
the
horse
took
it
as
a
compliment
and
walked
in
the
procession
with
visible
pride
and
i
found
the
church
in
which
no
collection
was
ever
taken
it
was
the
very
dom
in
my
own
old
town
the
velvet
purses
that
used
to
be
poked
into
the
pews
on
sundays
on
long
sticks
were
missing
and
i
asked
about
them
they
had
not
used
them
in
a
long
time
said
the
beadle
and
added
it
was
a
kind
of
catholic
fashion
anyway
and
no
good
the
pews
had
apparently
suspected
as
much
and
had
held
haughtily
aloof
from
the
purses
that
may
have
been
another
reason
for
their
going
the
old
town
ever
had
its
own
ways
they
were
mostly
good
ways
though
sometimes
odd
who
but
a
ribe
citizen
would
have
thought
of
knud
clausen
way
of
doing
my
wife
honor
on
the
sunday
morning
when
as
a
young
girl
she
went
to
church
to
be
confirmed
her
father
and
knud
were
neighbors
and
knud
was
a
sore
subject
between
them
being
right
under
the
other
window
he
sometimes
protested
and
oftener
offered
to
buy
but
knud
would
neither
listen
nor
sell
but
he
loved
the
ground
his
neighbor
pretty
daughter
walked
upon
as
did
indeed
every
poor
man
in
the
town
and
on
her
sunday
he
showed
it
by
strewing
the
offensive
pile
with
fresh
cut
grass
and
leaves
and
sticking
it
full
of
flowers
it
was
well
meant
and
it
was
danish
all
over
stick
up
for
your
rights
at
any
cost
these
secure
go
any
length
to
oblige
a
neighbor
journeying
so
i
came
from
the
home
of
dead
kings
at
last
to
that
of
the
living
old
king
christian
beloved
of
his
people
where
once
my
children
horrified
the
keeper
of
rosenborg
palace
by
playing
the
wild
man
of
borneo
with
the
official
silver
lions
in
the
great
knights
hall
and
i
saw
the
old
town
no
more
but
in
my
dreams
i
walk
its
peaceful
streets
listen
to
the
whisper
of
the
reeds
in
the
dry
moats
about
the
green
castle
hill
and
hear
my
mother
call
me
once
more
her
boy
and
i
know
that
i
shall
find
them
with
my
lost
childhood
when
we
all
reach
home
at
last
chapter
xvi
the
american
made
long
ago
when
i
found
my
work
beginning
to
master
me
i
put
up
a
nest
of
fifty
pigeonholes
in
my
office
so
that
with
system
i
might
get
the
upper
hand
of
it
only
to
find
as
the
years
passed
that
i
had
got
fifty
tyrants
for
one
the
other
day
i
had
to
call
in
a
hessian
to
help
me
tame
the
pigeonholes
he
was
a
serious
library
person
and
he
could
not
quite
make
out
what
it
meant
when
among
such
heads
as
slum
tenements
the
bend
and
rum
curse
he
came
upon
this
one
over
one
of
the
pigeonholes
him
all
that
goodly
company
did
as
deliverer
hail
they
tied
a
ribbon
round
his
neck
another
round
his
tail
with
all
his
learning
his
education
was
not
finished
for
he
had
missed
the
delectable
ballad
of
the
waller
lot
and
eugene
account
of
the
dignities
that
were
heaped
upon
clow
noble
yellow
pup
else
he
would
have
understood
the
pigeonhole
contained
most
of
the
honors
that
have
come
to
me
of
late
years
the
nominations
to
membership
in
societies
guilds
and
committees
in
conventions
at
home
and
abroad
most
of
them
declined
as
i
declined
governor
roosevelt
request
that
i
should
serve
on
the
last
commission
for
the
reason
which
i
have
given
heretofore
that
to
represent
is
not
my
business
to
write
is
i
can
do
it
much
better
and
back
up
the
other
so
we
are
two
for
one
not
that
i
would
be
understood
as
being
insensible
of
the
real
honor
intended
to
be
conferred
by
such
tokens
i
do
not
hold
them
lightly
i
value
the
good
opinion
of
my
for
with
it
comes
increased
power
to
do
things
but
i
would
reserve
the
honors
for
those
who
have
fairly
earned
them
and
on
whom
they
sit
easy
they
do
on
me
i
am
not
ornamental
by
nature
now
that
i
have
told
all
there
is
to
tell
the
reader
is
at
liberty
to
agree
with
my
little
boy
concerning
the
upshot
of
it
he
was
having
a
talk
with
his
mother
the
other
day
in
the
course
of
which
she
told
him
that
we
must
be
patient
no
one
in
the
world
was
all
good
except
god
illustration
the
cross
of
dannebrog
and
you
said
he
admiringly
he
is
his
father
son
she
demurred
but
he
stoutly
maintained
his
own
i
bet
you
he
said
if
you
were
to
ask
lots
of
people
around
here
they
would
say
you
were
fine
but
he
struggled
reflectively
with
a
button
gee
i
ca
understand
why
they
make
such
a
fuss
about
papa
out
of
the
mouth
of
babes
etc
the
boy
is
right
i
can
not
either
and
it
makes
me
feel
small
i
did
my
work
and
tried
to
put
into
it
what
i
thought
citizenship
ought
to
be
when
i
made
it
out
i
wish
i
had
made
it
out
earlier
for
my
own
peace
of
mind
and
that
is
all
there
is
to
it
for
hating
the
slum
what
credit
belongs
to
me
who
could
love
it
when
it
comes
to
that
perhaps
it
was
the
open
the
woods
the
freedom
of
my
danish
fields
i
loved
the
contrast
that
was
hateful
i
hate
darkness
and
dirt
anywhere
and
naturally
want
to
let
in
the
light
i
will
have
no
dark
corners
in
my
own
cellar
it
must
be
whitewashed
clean
nature
i
think
intended
me
for
a
cobbler
or
a
i
love
to
mend
and
make
crooked
things
straight
when
i
was
a
carpenter
i
preferred
to
make
an
old
house
over
to
building
a
new
just
now
i
am
trying
to
help
a
young
couple
set
up
in
the
laundry
business
it
is
along
the
same
line
that
is
the
reason
i
picked
it
out
for
them
if
any
of
my
readers
know
of
a
good
place
for
them
to
start
i
wish
they
would
tell
me
of
it
they
are
just
two
young
people
with
the
world
before
them
my
office
years
ago
became
notorious
as
a
sort
of
misfit
shop
where
things
were
matched
that
had
got
mislaid
in
the
hurry
and
bustle
of
life
in
which
some
of
us
always
get
shoved
aside
some
one
has
got
to
do
that
and
i
like
the
job
which
is
fortunate
for
i
have
no
head
for
creative
work
of
any
kind
the
publishers
bother
me
to
write
a
novel
editors
want
me
on
their
staffs
i
shall
do
neither
for
the
good
reason
that
i
am
neither
poet
philosopher
nor
i
was
going
to
say
philanthropist
but
leave
me
that
i
would
love
my
for
the
rest
i
am
a
reporter
of
facts
and
that
i
would
remain
so
i
know
what
i
can
do
and
how
to
do
it
best
illustration
after
years
we
all
love
power
to
be
on
the
winning
side
you
can
not
help
being
there
when
you
are
fighting
the
slum
for
it
is
the
cause
of
justice
and
right
how
then
can
you
lose
and
what
matters
it
how
you
fare
your
cause
is
bound
to
win
i
said
it
before
but
it
will
bear
to
be
said
again
not
once
but
many
times
every
defeat
in
such
a
fight
is
a
step
toward
victory
taken
in
the
right
spirit
in
the
end
you
will
come
out
ahead
the
power
of
the
biggest
boss
is
like
chaff
in
your
hands
you
can
see
his
finish
and
he
knows
it
hence
even
he
will
treat
you
with
respect
however
he
try
to
bluff
you
he
is
the
one
who
is
afraid
the
ink
was
not
dry
upon
bishop
potter
arraignment
of
tammany
bestiality
before
richard
croker
was
offering
to
sacrifice
his
most
faithful
henchmen
as
the
price
of
peace
and
he
would
have
done
it
had
the
bishop
but
crooked
his
little
finger
in
the
direction
of
any
one
of
them
the
boss
has
the
courage
of
the
brute
or
he
would
not
be
boss
but
when
it
comes
to
a
moral
issue
he
is
the
biggest
coward
in
the
lot
the
bigger
the
brute
the
more
abject
its
terror
at
what
it
does
not
understand
some
of
the
honors
i
refused
there
were
some
my
heart
craved
and
i
could
not
let
them
go
there
hangs
on
my
wall
the
passport
governor
roosevelt
gave
me
when
i
went
abroad
dearer
to
me
than
sheepskin
or
degree
for
the
heart
of
a
friend
is
in
it
what
would
i
not
give
to
be
worthy
of
its
faithful
affection
sometimes
when
i
go
abroad
i
wear
upon
my
breast
a
golden
cross
which
king
christian
gave
me
it
is
the
old
crusaders
cross
in
the
sign
of
which
my
stern
forefathers
conquered
the
heathen
and
themselves
on
many
a
field
my
father
wore
it
for
long
and
faithful
service
to
the
state
i
rendered
none
i
can
think
of
but
one
chance
i
had
to
strike
a
blow
for
the
old
flag
that
was
when
in
a
typhus
epidemic
i
found
the
health
officers
using
it
as
a
fever
flag
to
warn
boats
away
from
the
emergency
hospital
pier
at
east
sixteenth
street
they
had
no
idea
of
what
flag
it
was
they
just
happened
to
have
it
on
hand
but
they
found
out
quickly
i
gave
them
half
an
hour
in
which
to
find
another
the
hospital
was
full
of
very
sick
patients
or
i
should
have
made
them
fire
a
salute
to
old
dannebrog
by
way
of
reparation
as
it
was
i
think
they
had
visions
of
ironclads
in
the
east
river
they
had
one
of
a
very
angry
reporter
anyhow
but
though
i
did
nothing
to
deserve
it
i
wear
the
cross
proudly
for
the
love
i
bear
the
flag
under
which
i
was
born
and
the
good
old
king
who
gave
it
to
me
i
saw
him
often
when
i
was
a
young
lad
in
that
which
makes
the
man
he
had
not
changed
when
last
i
met
him
in
copenhagen
they
told
there
how
beggars
used
to
waylay
him
on
his
daily
walks
until
the
police
threatened
them
with
arrest
then
they
stood
at
a
distance
making
sorrowful
gestures
and
the
king
who
understood
laid
a
silver
coin
upon
the
palace
window
shelf
and
went
his
way
the
king
must
obey
the
law
but
he
can
forget
the
principles
of
as
may
the
rest
of
us
at
christmas
and
be
blameless
of
that
last
meeting
with
king
christian
i
mean
to
let
my
american
know
so
that
they
may
understand
what
manner
of
man
is
he
whom
they
call
in
europe
its
first
gentleman
and
in
denmark
the
good
king
but
first
i
shall
have
to
tell
how
my
father
came
to
wear
the
cross
of
dannebrog
he
was
very
old
at
the
time
retired
long
since
from
his
post
which
he
had
filled
faithfully
forty
years
and
more
in
some
way
i
never
knew
quite
how
they
passed
him
by
with
the
cross
at
the
time
of
the
retirement
perhaps
he
had
given
offence
by
refusing
a
title
he
was
an
independent
old
man
and
cared
nothing
for
such
things
but
i
knew
that
the
cross
he
would
gladly
have
worn
for
the
king
he
had
served
so
well
and
when
he
sat
in
the
shadow
with
the
darkness
closing
in
i
planned
to
get
it
for
him
as
the
one
thing
i
knew
would
give
him
pleasure
but
the
official
red
tape
was
stronger
than
i
until
one
day
roused
to
anger
by
it
all
i
wrote
direct
to
the
king
and
told
him
about
it
i
showed
him
the
wrong
that
had
been
done
and
told
him
that
i
was
sure
he
would
set
it
right
as
soon
as
he
knew
of
it
and
i
was
not
mistaken
the
old
town
was
put
into
a
great
state
of
excitement
and
mystification
when
one
day
there
arrived
in
a
large
official
envelope
straight
from
the
king
the
cross
long
since
given
up
for
indeed
the
minister
had
told
me
that
my
father
having
been
retired
the
case
was
closed
the
injustice
that
had
been
done
was
itself
a
bar
to
its
being
undone
there
was
no
precedent
for
such
action
that
was
what
i
told
the
king
and
also
that
it
was
his
business
to
set
precedents
and
he
did
four
years
later
when
i
took
my
children
home
to
let
my
father
bless
them
they
were
his
only
grandchildren
and
he
had
never
seen
any
of
them
he
sat
in
his
easy
chair
and
wondered
yet
at
the
queer
way
in
which
that
cross
came
and
i
marvelled
with
him
he
died
without
knowing
how
i
had
interfered
it
was
better
so
illustration
king
christian
as
i
saw
him
last
it
was
when
i
went
home
to
mother
that
i
met
king
christian
last
they
had
told
me
the
right
way
to
approach
the
king
the
proper
number
of
bows
and
all
that
and
i
meant
to
faithfully
observe
it
all
i
saw
a
tired
and
lonely
old
man
to
whom
my
heart
went
out
on
the
instant
and
i
went
right
up
and
shook
hands
and
told
him
how
much
i
thought
of
him
and
how
sorry
i
was
for
his
losing
his
wife
the
queen
louise
whom
everybody
loved
he
looked
surprised
a
moment
then
such
a
friendly
look
came
into
his
face
and
i
thought
him
the
handsomest
king
that
ever
was
he
asked
about
the
danes
in
america
and
i
told
him
they
were
good
citizens
better
for
not
forgetting
their
motherland
and
him
in
his
age
and
loss
he
patted
my
hand
with
a
glad
little
laugh
and
bade
me
tell
them
how
much
he
appreciated
it
and
how
kindly
his
thoughts
were
of
them
all
as
i
made
to
go
after
a
long
talk
he
stopped
me
and
touching
the
little
silver
cross
on
my
coat
lapel
asked
what
it
was
i
told
him
told
him
of
the
motto
in
his
name
and
of
the
labor
of
devoted
women
in
our
great
country
to
make
it
mean
what
it
said
as
i
spoke
i
remembered
my
father
and
i
took
it
off
and
gave
it
to
him
bidding
him
keep
it
for
surely
few
men
could
wear
it
so
worthily
but
he
put
it
back
into
my
hand
thanking
me
with
a
faithful
grasp
of
his
own
he
could
not
take
it
from
me
he
said
and
so
we
parted
i
thought
with
a
pang
of
remorse
as
i
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
parting
bow
i
had
forgotten
and
turned
around
to
make
good
the
omission
there
stood
the
king
in
his
blue
uniform
nodding
so
mildly
to
me
with
a
smile
so
full
of
kindness
that
i
why
i
just
nodded
back
and
waved
my
hand
it
was
very
improper
i
dare
say
perfectly
shocking
but
never
was
heartier
greeting
to
king
i
meant
every
bit
of
it
the
next
year
he
sent
me
his
cross
of
gold
for
the
one
of
silver
i
offered
him
i
wear
it
gladly
for
the
knighthood
it
confers
pledges
to
the
defence
of
womanhood
and
of
little
children
and
if
i
can
not
wield
lance
and
sword
as
the
king
men
of
old
i
can
wield
the
pen
it
may
be
that
in
the
providence
of
god
the
shedding
of
ink
in
the
cause
of
right
shall
set
the
world
farther
ahead
in
our
day
than
the
of
all
the
ages
past
these
i
could
not
forego
neither
when
friends
gathered
in
the
king
daughters
settlement
on
our
silver
wedding
day
and
with
loving
words
gave
to
the
new
house
my
name
could
i
say
them
nay
it
stands
that
house
within
a
stone
throw
of
many
a
door
in
which
i
sat
friendless
and
forlorn
trying
to
hide
from
the
policeman
who
would
not
let
me
sleep
within
hail
of
the
bend
of
the
wicked
past
atoned
for
at
last
of
the
bowery
where
i
lay
senseless
on
the
stairs
after
my
first
day
work
in
the
newspaper
office
starved
to
death
but
the
memory
of
the
old
days
has
no
sting
its
message
is
one
of
hope
the
house
itself
is
the
it
is
the
pledge
of
a
better
day
of
the
defeat
of
the
slum
with
its
helpless
heredity
of
despair
that
shall
damn
no
longer
lives
yet
unborn
children
of
god
are
we
that
is
our
challenge
to
the
slum
and
on
earth
we
shall
claim
yet
our
heritage
of
light
illustration
the
jacob
riis
house
no
henry
street
new
york
of
home
and
neighborliness
restored
it
is
the
pledge
the
want
of
them
makes
the
great
gap
in
the
city
life
that
is
to
be
our
modern
civic
life
with
the
home
preserved
we
may
look
forward
without
fear
there
is
no
question
that
can
be
asked
of
the
republic
to
which
we
shall
not
find
the
answer
we
may
not
always
agree
as
to
what
is
right
but
starting
there
we
shall
be
seeking
the
right
and
seeking
we
shall
find
it
ruin
and
disaster
are
at
the
end
of
the
road
that
starts
from
the
slum
perhaps
it
is
easy
for
me
to
preach
contentment
with
a
mother
who
prays
a
wife
who
fills
the
house
with
song
and
the
laughter
of
happy
children

well
be

make
sure
the

could
appreciate

for
all

i
would
have
that

compulsory

a

calls
upon

insist

not
loafing
and
not
be
allowed
to
obscure
their

serious

me

encouraging
truancy
we
are
quite
sure
he
writes
that
no
really
up

boy
ever
thinks
of
such

yet
if
he
take

notion
you
never

busy

the
barrel
they
kept
us
in
at
school
when
we
were
bad
i
told
of
it
before
putting
the
lid
on
was
a
sure
preventive
with
our
little
short
legs
we
could
climb
out

i
recommend
it
it
just
comes
to
me

things
will
it
was
held
to
be
a
powerful

bringing

christmas
eve
with
the
king
daughters
looking
back
over
thirty
years
it
seems
to
me
that
never
had
man
better
a
time
than
i
enough
of
the
editor
chaps
there
were
always
to
keep
up
the
spirits
the
hardships
people
write
to
me
about
were
not
worth
while
mentioning
and
anyway
they
had
to
be
to
get
some
of
the
crankery
out
of
me
i
guess
but
the
friendships
endure
for
all
the
rebuffs
of
my
life
they
have
more
than
made
up

i

them

the
good
men
and
women
who
have
called
me
friend
i
am
filled
with
wonder
and
gratitude
i
know
the
editor
of
the
heavy
responsibilities
would
not
have
approved
of
all
of
them
even
the
police
might
not
have
done
it
but
then
police
approval
is
not
a
certificate
of
character
to
one
who
has
lived
the
best
part
of
his
life
in
mulberry
street
they
drove
harry
hill
out
of
the
business
after
milking
him
dry
harry
hill
kept
a
dive
but
he
was
a
square
man
his
word
was
as
good
as
his
bond
he
was
hardly
a
model
citizen
but
in
a
hard
winter
he
kept
half
the
ward
from
starving
his
hung
out
always
to
those
in
need
harry
was
no
particular
friend
of
mine
i
mention
him
as
a
type
of
some
to
whom
objection
might
be
made
but
then
the
police
would
certainly
disapprove
of
parkhurst
whom
i
am
glad
to
call
by
the
name
of
friend
they
might
even
object
to
bishop
potter
whose
friendship
i
return
with
a
warmth
that
is
nowise
dampened
by
his
disapproval
of
reporters
as
a
class
there
is
where
the
bishop
is
mistaken
we
are
none
of
us
infallible
and
what
a
good
thing
it
is
that
we
are
not
think
of
having
an
infallible
friend
to
live
alongside
of
always
how
long
could
you
stand
it
we
were
not
infallible

the

playing
on

under

the
time
is
at
hand
when
we
shall
bring
to
them
in
their
slum
the
things
which
we
must
now
bring
them
to
see
and
then
the
slum
will
be
no
more
how
little
we
grasp
the
meaning
of
it
all
in
a
report
of
the
commissioner
of
education
i
read
the
other
day
that
of
kindergarten
children
in
an
eastern
city
who
were
questioned
per
cent
did
not
know
a
robin
and
more
than
half
had
not
seen
a
dandelion
in
its
yellow
glory
and
yet
we
complain
that
our
cities
are
misgoverned
you
who
think
that
the
teaching
of
civics
in
the
school
covers
it
all
i
am
not
speaking
to
you
you
will
never
understand
but
the
rest
of
you
who
are
willing
to
sit
with
me
at
the
feet
of
little
molly
and
learn
from
her
listen
she
was
poor
and
ragged
and
starved
her
home
was
a
hovel
we
were
debating
some
good
women
who
knew
her
and
i
how
best
to
make
a
merry
christmas
for
her
and
my
material
mind
hung
upon
clothes
and
boots
and
rubbers
for
it
was
in
chicago
but
the
vision
of
her
soul
was
a
pair
of
red
shoes
her
heart
craved
them
aye
brethren
and
she
got
them
not
for
all
the
gold
in
the
treasury
would
i
have
trodden
it
under
in
pork
and
beans
smothered
it
in
no
not
in
rubber
boots
though
the
mud
in
the
city
by
the
lake
be
both
deep
and
black
they
were
the
window
those
red
shoes
through
which
her
little
captive
soul
looked
out
and
yearned
for
the
beauty
of
god
great
world
could
i
forget
the
blue
boots
with
the
tassels
which
i
worshipped
in
my
boyhood
nay
friends
the
robin
and
the
dandelion
we
must
put
back
into
those
barren
lives
if
we
would
have
good
citizenship
they
and
the
citizenship
are
first
cousins
we
robbed
the
children
of
them
or
stood
by
and
saw
it
done
and
it
is
for
us
to
restore
them
that
is
my
answer
to
the
missionary
who
writes
to
ask
what
is
the
most
practical
way
of
making
good
christians
and
american
citizens
out
of
the
emigrants
who
sit
heavy
on
her
conscience
as
well
they
may
christianity
without
the
robin
and
the
dandelion
is
never
going
to
reach
down
into
the
slum
american
citizenship
without
them
would
leave
the
slum
there
to
dig
the
grave
of
it
and
of
the
republic
light
ahead
the
very
battle
that
is
now
waged
for
righteousness
on
the
once
forgotten
east
side
is
our
answer
to
the
cry
of
the
young
who
having
seen
the
light
were
willing
no
longer
to
live
in
darkness
i
know
for
i
was
one
of
the
committee
which
felix
adler
called
together
in
response
to
their
appeal
a
year
ago
the
committee
of
fifteen
succeeded
to
its
work
what
does
it
all
help
the
doubting
thomases
have
asked
a
years
watching
the
settlements
build
their
bridge
of
hearts
between
mansion
and
tenement
and
hundreds
give
devoted
lives
of
toil
and
sacrifice
to
make
it
strong
and
lasting
and
ever
the
answer
came
back
sturdily
wait
and
see
it
will
come
and
now
it
has
come
the
work
is
bearing
fruit
on
the
east
side
the
young
rise
in
rebellion
against
the
slum
on
the
west
side
the
league
for
political
education
runs
a
omen
of
good
sense
and
of
victory
so
the
country
is
safe
when
we
fight
no
longer
for
the
poor
but
with
the
poor
the
slum
is
taken
in
the
rear
and
beaten
already

i
had
warning
that
the
night
cometh
when
no
man
can
work
and
mulberry
street
knew
me
no
more
i
am
still
a
young
man
not
far
past
fifty
and
i
have
much
i
would
do
yet
but
what
if
it
were
ordered
otherwise
i
have
been
very
happy
no
man
ever
had
so
good
a

should
i
not

content

the
baby
i
dreamed
a
beautiful
dream
in

youth
and
i
awoke
and
found
it
true
my
silver
bride
they
called
her
just
now
the
frost
is
upon
my
head
indeed
hers
winter
has
not
touched
with
its
softest
breath
her
footfall
is
the
lightest
her
laugh
the
merriest

are

stouter
champion
of
the
flag
is
in
the
land
sometimes
when
she
sings
with
the
children
i
sit
and
listen
and
with
her
voice
there
comes
to
me
as
an
echo
of
the
long
past
the
words
in
her
letter
that
blessed
first
letter
in
which
she
wrote
down
the
text
of
all
my
we
will
strive
together
for
all
that
is
noble
and
good
so
she
saw
her
duty
as
a
true
american
and
aye
she
has
kept
the
pledge
but
here
comes
our
daughter
with
little
virginia
to
visit
her
grandpapa
oh
the
little
vixen
then
where
is
his
peace
god
bless
the
child
i
have
told
the
story
of
the
making
of
an
american
there
remains
to
tell
how
i
found
out
that
he
vas
made
and
finished
at
last
it
was
when
i
went
back
to
see
my
mother
once
more
and
wandering
about
the
country
of
my
childhood
memories
had
come
to
the
city
of
elsinore
there
i
fell
ill
of
a
fever
and
lay
many
weeks
in
the
house
of
a
friend
upon
the
shore
of
the
beautiful
oeresund
one
day
when
the
fever
had
left
me
they
rolled
my
bed
into
a
room
overlooking
the
sea
the
sunlight
danced
upon
the
waves
and
the
distant
mountains
of
sweden
were
blue
against
the
horizon
ships
passed
under
full
sail
up
and
down
the
great
waterway
of
the
nations
but
the
sunshine
and
the
peaceful
day
bore
no
message
to
me
i
lay
moodily
picking
at
the
coverlet
sick
and
discouraged
and
sore
i
hardly
knew
why
myself
until
all
at
once
there
sailed
past
close
inshore
a
ship
flying
at
the
top
the
flag
of
freedom
blown
out
on
the
breeze
till
every
star
in
it
shone
bright
and
clear
that
moment
i
knew
gone
were
illness
discouragement
and
gloom
forgotten
weakness
and
suffering
the
cautions
of
doctor
and
nurse
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
shouted
laughed
and
cried
by
turns
waving
my
handkerchief
to
the
flag
out
there
they
thought
i
had
lost
my
head
but
i
told
them
no
thank
god
i
had
found
it
and
my
heart
too
at
last
i
knew
then
that
it
was
my
flag
that
my
children
home
was
mine
indeed
that
i
also
had
become
an
american
in
truth
and
i
thanked
god
and
like
unto
the
man
sick
of
the
palsy
arose
from
my
bed
and
went
home
healed

minute
