i
an
appalling
crash
piercing
shrieks
a
loud
unequal
quarrel
on
a
staircase
the
sharp
bang
of
a
door
edith
started
up
from
her
restful
corner
on
the
blue
sofa
by
the
fire
where
she
had
been
thinking
about
her
guest
and
rushed
to
the
door
archie
come
here
directly
what
that
noise
a
boy
of
ten
came
calmly
into
the
room
was
me
that
made
the
noise
he
said
was
madame
frabelle
his
mother
looked
at
him
he
was
a
handsome
fair
boy
with
clear
grey
eyes
that
looked
you
straight
in
the
face
without
telling
you
anything
at
all
long
eyelashes
that
softened
but
gave
a
sly
humour
to
his
glance
a
round
face
a
very
large
forehead
and
smooth
hair
already
at
this
early
age
he
had
the
expressionless
reserve
of
the
public
school
where
he
was
to
be
sent
with
something
of
the
suave
superiority
of
the
university
for
which
he
was
intended
edith
thought
he
inherited
both
of
these
traits
from
her
she
gazed
at
him
wondering
as
she
had
often
wondered
at
the
impossibility
of
guessing
even
vaguely
what
was
really
going
on
behind
that
large
brow
and
he
looked
back
observantly
but
not
expressively
at
her
she
was
a
slim
fair
pretty
woman
with
more
vividness
and
character
than
usually
goes
with
her
type
like
the
boy
she
had
grey
eyes
and
hair
her
mouth
and
chin
were
of
the
order
and
her
charm
which
was
great
but
unintentional
and
generally
unconscious
appealed
partly
to
the
senses
and
partly
to
the
intellect
she
was
essentially
not
one
of
those
women
who
irritate
all
their
own
sex
by
their
power
and
still
more
by
their
fixed
determination
to
attract
men
she
was
really
and
unusually
indifferent
to
general
admiration
still
that
she
was
not
a
cold
woman
not
incapable
of
passionate
feeling
was
obvious
to
any
physiognomist
the
fully
curved
lips
showed
her
generous
and
temperament
while
the
softly
glancing
intelligent
smiling
eyes
spoke
fastidiousness
and
discrimination
her
voice
was
low
and
soft
with
a
vibrating
sound
in
it
and
she
laughed
often
and
easily
being
very
ready
to
see
and
enjoy
the
amusing
side
of
life
but
observation
and
emotion
alike
were
instinctively
veiled
by
a
quiet
reposeful
manner
so
that
she
made
herself
further
popular
by
appearing
retiring
edith
ottley
might
so
easily
have
been
the
centre
of
any
group
and
yet
she
was
not
women
were
grateful
to
her
and
in
return
admitted
that
she
was
pretty
unaffected
and
charming
today
she
was
dressed
very
simply
in
dark
blue
and
might
have
passed
for
archie
elder
sister
is
anything
it
was
my
fault
it
was
her
fault
madame
frabelle
said
would
teach
me
to
take
away
her
mandolin
and
use
it
for
a
cricket
bat
she
need
teach
me
i
know
already
archie
you
know
perfectly
well
you
no
right
to
go
into
her
room
when
she
is
there

i
go
in
when
she
is
there
she
wo
let
me
besides
i
do
want
to
is
nice
of
you
you
ought
not
to
go
into
her
room
without
her
permission
is
her
room
it
your
room
at
least
it
the
spare
room
you
done
any
harm
to
the
mandolin
he
paused
a
little
as
he
often
did
before
answering
as
if
in
absence
of
mind
and
then
said
as
though
starting
up
from
a
reverie
no
no
harm
what
have
you
done
can
mend
it
he
answered
frabelle
has
been
very
kind
to
you
archie
i
sorry
you
not
behaving
nicely
to
a
guest
in
your
mother
house
it
is
the
act
of
a
gentleman
well
there
are
a
great
many
things
in
her
room
mother
some
of
them
are
rather
jolly
and
say
you
sorry
archie
and
you
must
do
it
again
it
be
the
act
of
a
gentleman
to
say
i
sorry
it
be
the
act
of
a
you
know
are
you
sorry
to
have
bothered
her
sorry
she
found
it
out
he
said
as
he
turned
to
the
door
perpetual
scenes
and
quarrels
between
my
son
and
my
guest
are
most
painful
to
me
edith
said
with
assumed
solemnity
he
looked
grave
she
need
have
quarrelled
is
she
very
kind
to
you
she
is
bad
sometimes
i
like
it
when
she
tells
me
lies
about
what
her
husband
used
to
do
i
mean
stories
she
not
a
bad
sort
is
she
a
homeless
refugette
mother
exactly
that
she
a
widow
and
she
staying
with
us
and
we
must
be
nice
to
her
now
you
wo
forget
again
will
you
but
i
can
mend
it
think
i
better
go
up
and
see
her
said
edith
archie
politely
opened
the
door
for
his
mother
should
if
i
were
you
he
said
edith
slowly
went
back
to
the
fire
i
leave
her
a
little
while
perhaps
now
do
go
and
do
something
useful
useful
gracious
i
have
got
much
more
of
my
holidays
mother
no
reason
why
you
should
spend
your
time
in
worrying
everybody
and
smashing
the
musical
instruments
of
guests
that
are
under
your
roof
he
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
and
smiled
as
if
pleased
at
this
way
of
putting
it
suppose
she
very
glad
to
have
a
roof
to
her
mouth
i
mean
to
her
head
he
hurriedly
corrected
mother
she
is
poor
she
has
an
amber
necklace
besides
she
gave
dilly
sixpence
the
other
day
for
not
being
frightened
of
a
cow
if
she
can
afford
to
give
a
little
girl
sixpence
for
every
animal
she
says
she
is
afraid
of
only
proves
she
kind
and
i
did
say
she
was
poor
that
not
the
point
we
must
be
nice
and
considerate
to
anyone
staying
with
us
do
you
see
he
became
again
for
a
minute
i
should
be
surprised
if
she
be
able
to
use
it
again
he
said
consolingly
mandolin
i
mean
besides
what
the
good
of
it
anyway
i
say
mother
are
all
foreigners
frabelle
is
not
a
foreigner
never
said
she
was
but
her
husband
was
he
used
to
get
into
frightful
rages
with
her
sometimes
she
says
he
was
a
noble
fellow
she
liked
him
awfully
but
she
says
he
never
understood
her
do
you
suppose
she
talked
english
to
him
enough
archie
go
and
find
something
to
do
as
he
went
out
he
turned
round
again
and
said
father
like
her
yes
of
course
he
does
funny
said
archie
i
say
i
sorry
when
i
see
her
again
edith
kissed
him
a
proceeding
that
he
bore
heroically
he
was
kissable
but
she
seldom
gave
way
to
the
temptation
then
she
went
back
to
the
sofa
she
wanted
to
go
on
thinking
about
that
mystery
her
guest
chapter
ii
madame
frabelle
had
arrived
about
a
fortnight
ago
with
a
letter
of
introduction
from
lady
conroy
lady
conroy
herself
was
a
vague
amiable
irishwoman
with
a
very
large
family
of
children
she
and
edith
who
knew
each
other
slightly
before
had
grown
intimate
when
they
met
the
previous
summer
at
a
french
the
letter
asked
edith
with
urgent
inconsequence
to
be
kind
to
madame
frabelle
of
whom
lady
conroy
said
nothing
except
that
she
was
of
good
family
she
had
been
a
miss
eglantine
pollard
and
was
the
widow
of
a
french
wine
merchant
she
was
described
as
a
clever
interesting
woman
who
wished
to
study
english
life
in
her
native
land
it
did
not
surprise
lady
conroy
in
the
least
that
an
englishwoman
should
wish
to
study
english
in
england
but
she
was
a
woman
who
was
never
surprised
at
anything
except
the
obvious
and
the
inevitable
edith
had
not
had
the
faintest
idea
of
asking
madame
frabelle
to
stay
at
her
very
small
house
in
sloane
street
for
which
invitation
indeed
there
seemed
no
possible
need
or
occasion
yet
she
found
herself
asking
her
visitor
to
stay
for
a
few
days
until
a
house
or
a
hotel
should
be
found
and
bruce
who
detested
guests
in
the
house
seconded
the
invitation
with
warmth
and
enthusiasm
as
bruce
was
a
subconscious
snob
he
may
have
been
slightly
influenced
by
the
letter
from
lady
conroy
who
was
the
wife
of
an
unprominent
cabinet
minister
and
in
a
casual
way
rather
if
not
exactly
smart
but
this
consideration
could
not
weigh
with
edith
and
its
effect
on
bruce
must
have
long
passed
away
madame
frabelle
accepted
the
invitation
as
a
matter
of
course
made
use
of
it
as
a
matter
of
convenience
and
had
remained
ever
since
showing
no
sign
of
leaving
edith
was
deeply
interested
in
her
and
bruce
was
more
genuinely
impressed
and
unconsciously
bored
by
madame
frabelle
than
by
any
woman
he
had
ever
met
yet
she
was
not
at
all
extraordinary
she
was
a
tall
woman
of
about
fifty
well
bred
without
being
distinguished
who
could
never
have
been
handsome
but
was
graceful
dignified
and
pleasing
she
was
neither
dark
nor
fair
she
had
a
broad
face
and
a
pale
clear
complexion
she
was
inclined
to
be
fat
not
locally
in
the
manner
of
a
pincushion
but
with
the
generally
diffused
plumpness
described
in
shops
as
stock
size
she
was
not
the
sort
of
modern
woman
of
fifty
with
a
thin
figure
and
a
good
deal
of
rouge
who
looks
young
from
the
back
when
dancing
or
walking
and
talks
volubly
and
confidentially
of
her
young
men
she
had
of
course
nothing
of
the
woman
of
the
past
who
at
her
age
would
have
been
definitely
on
the
shelf
doing
or
collecting
recipes
there
nor
did
she
resemble
the
type
in
perpetual
clothes
with
short
grey
hair
and
who
belongs
to
clubs
and
talks
chiefly
of
the
franchise
madame
frabelle
was
soft
womanly
amiable
yet
extremely
outspoken
very
firm
and
inclined
to
lay
down
the
law
she
was
certainly
charming
as
bruce
and
edith
agreed
every
day
even
now
when
they
were
beginning
to
wonder
when
she
was
going
away
she
had
an
extraordinary
amount
of
personal
magnetism
since
she
convinced
both
the
ottleys
as
she
had
convinced
lady
conroy
that
she
was
wonderfully
clever
in
fact
that
she
knew
everything
a
fortnight
had
passed
and
edith
was
beginning
to
grow
doubtful
was
she
so
clever
did
she
know
everything
did
she
know
anything
at
all
long
arguments
that
grew
quite
heated
and
excited
at
luncheon
or
dinner
about
the
origin
of
a
word
the
author
of
a
book
and
various
debatable
questions
of
the
kind
invariably
ended
after
reference
to
a
dictionary
or
an
encyclopaedia
in
madame
frabelle
proving
herself
with
an
air
of
triumph
to
be
completely
and
entirely
wrong
she
was
as
generally
positive
as
she
was
fatally
mistaken
yet
so
intense
a
belief
had
she
in
her
intuition
as
well
as
in
her
own
inaccurate
information
that
her
hypnotised
hosts
were
growing
daily
more
and
more
under
her
thumb
she
took
it
for
granted
that
everyone
would
take
her
for
granted
and
everyone
did
was
all
this
agreeable
or
otherwise
edith
thought
it
must
be
or
how
could
they
bear
it
at
all
if
it
had
not
been
extremely
pleasant
it
would
have
been
simply
impossible
the
fair
gentle
pretty
edith
who
was
more
subtle
than
she
appeared
on
the
surface
while
apparently
indolent
had
a
very
active
brain
madame
frabelle
caused
her
to
use
it
more
than
she
had
ever
done
before
edith
was
intensely
curious
and
until
she
understood
her
visitor
she
could
not
rest
satisfied
she
made
her
a
psychological
study
for
example
here
was
a
curious
little
point
madame
frabelle
did
not
look
young
for
her
age
nor
did
she
seem
in
the
least
inclined
to
wish
to
be
admired
nor
ever
to
have
been
a
flirt
the
word
for
example
would
have
been
quite
grotesque
as
associated
with
her
though
she
was
by
no
means
prudish
as
to
subjects
of
conversation
nor
prim
in
the
way
yet
somehow
it
would
not
have
seemed
incongruous
or
surprising
if
one
had
found
out
that
there
was
even
now
some
romance
in
her
life
but
doubtless
the
most
striking
thing
about
her
and
what
made
her
popular
was
her
intense
interest
in
other
people
it
went
so
far
as
to
reach
the
very
verge
of
being
interference
but
she
was
so
pleasant
that
one
could
scarcely
resent
it
either
as
curiosity
or
intrusion
since
she
had
stayed
with
the
ottleys
she
appeared
to
think
of
and
nothing
else
in
the
world
one
would
think
that
else
existed
for
her
and
after
all
such
extreme
interest
is
flattering
bruce
archie
edith
even
dilly
nurse
all
had
in
her
an
audience
interested
absorbed
enchanted
who
could
help
enjoying
it
edith
was
still
thinking
about
madame
frabelle
when
a
few
minutes
later
bruce
came
in
bruce
also
was
fair
besides
being
tall
and
well
built
known
by
their
friends
for
some
reason
as
the
little
ottleys
these
two
were
a
rather
pair
and
at
a
casual
glance
admirably
suited
to
one
another
they
appeared
to
be
exactly
like
thousands
of
other
english
married
couples
of
the
upper
middle
class
between
thirty
and
forty
he
looked
as
manly
through
being
sunburnt
from
knocking
a
little
ball
over
the
links
as
if
he
habitually
went
but
though
not
without
charm
he
had
much
less
distinction
than
his
wife
most
people
smiled
when
bruce
name
was
mentioned
and
it
was
usual
for
his
intimates
to
clap
him
on
the
back
and
call
him
a
silly
ass
which
proves
he
was
not
unpopular
on
the
other
hand
edith
was
described
as
a
very
pretty
woman
or
a
nice
little
thing
and
by
the
more
discriminating
jolly
clever
when
you
know
her
and
do
you
forget
it
when
bruce
told
his
wife
that
had
ever
regretted
consulting
him
on
a
difficult
secret
and
delicate
matter
edith
had
said
she
was
quite
sure
they
had
perhaps
she
thought
had
ever
regretted
consulting
him
on
such
a
subject
simply
because
had
ever
tried
please
do
move
edith
he
said
in
the
tone
which
means
please
do
move
like
to
see
you
comfortable
there
was
something
in
his
manner
that
made
her
feel
apologetic
and
she
changed
her
position
with
the
feeling
of
guilt
about
nothing
and
a
tinge
of
shame
for
something
she
had
done
easily
produced
by
an
air
of
bruce
was
apt
to
show
at
such
moments
hair
coming
down
edith
he
said
kindly
to
add
to
her
vague
embarrassment
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
curl
by
the
right
ear
was
only
about
of
an
inch
farther
on
the
cheek
than
it
was
intended
to
be
but
by
this
observation
he
got
the
advantage
of
her
by
giving
the
impression
that
she
looked
wild
unkempt
and
ruffled
though
she
was
in
reality
exactly
as
trim
and
neat
as
always
about
the
delicate
matter
you
were
going
to
talk
over
with
me
bruce
yes
oh
by
the
way
he
said
we
go
into
that
i
wonder
if
you
could
help
me
about
something
you
could
do
me
a
really
great
service
by
helping
me
to
find
a
certain
book
of
course
bruce
with
pleasure
what
is
the
book
asked
the
amiable
wife
looking
alert
bruce
looked
at
her
with
pity
is
the
book
my
dear
edith
do
you
see
i
should
have
come
to
you
about
it
if
i
knew
what
the
book
was
beg
your
pardon
bruce
said
edith
now
feeling
thoroughly
in
the
wrong
and
looking
round
the
room
if
you
ca
give
me
the
name
of
the
book
i
scarcely
see
how
i
can
find
it
if
i
knew
its
name
i
should
want
your
assistance
it
seemed
a
deadlock
going
to
the
bookcase
edith
said
you
give
me
some
idea
of
what
it
like
i
can
i
seen
it
a
hundred
times
in
this
very
room
in
fact
it
always
here
except
when
it
wanted
edith
went
down
on
her
knees
in
front
of
the
bookcase
and
bruce
on
the
physiognomy
of
the
volume
she
asked
whether
it
was
a
novel
whether
it
was
blue
whether
it
belonged
to
the
library
whether
it
was
stevenson
whether
it
was
french
or
if
it
was
suitable
for
the
children
to
all
of
these
questions
he
returned
a
negative
for
the
children
he
repeated
a
fantastic
idea
do
you
think
i
should
take
all
this
trouble
to
come
and
request
your
assistance
and
spend
hours
of
valuable
time
looking
for
a
book
that
suitable
for
the
children
bruce
if
you
request
my
assistance
without
having
the
slightest
idea
of
what
book
it
is
how
shall
i
possibly
be
able
to
help
so
quite
so
never
mind
edith
do
trouble
if
i
say
that
it
a
pity
there
is
more
order
in
the
house
you
wo
regard
it
i
hope
dear
as
a
reproach
in
any
way
if
there
were
a
place
for
everything
and
everything
in
its
place
however
never
mind
it
a
small
matter
and
it
ca
be
helped
i
know
edith
dear
you
were
not
brought
up
to
be
strictly
orderly
some
people
are
not
i
do
blame
you
not
in
the
least
still
when
dilly
grows
up
i
shall
be
sorry
if
it
nothing
to
do
with
order
the
room
is
perfectly
tidy
a
question
of
your
memory
you
do
remember
the
name
of
the
book
me
it
not
a
question
of
remembering
the
name
that
would
be
nothing
anyone
can
forget
a
name
that
would
matter
then
you
mean
you
do
even
know
in
the
least
what
you
want
at
this
moment
bruce
decided
it
was
time
to
find
the
book
and
suddenly
sprang
like
a
fawn
at
the
seizing
a
volume
triumphantly
it
is
the
whole
time
he
said
at
you
while
you
are
helplessly
looking
for
it
oh
edith
edith
he
laughed
amiably
like
a
woman
that
is
and
the
very
book
a
few
inches
from
your
hand
well
well
never
mind
it
found
at
last
i
hope
dear
in
the
future
you
will
be
more
careful
we
say
no
more
about
it
now
edith
did
point
out
to
bruce
that
the
book
was
a
novel
that
it
was
blue
that
it
belonged
to
the
library
was
french
and
that
it
was
still
suitable
for
the
children
well
he
said
sitting
down
with
the
book
which
he
had
never
wanted
at
all
and
had
never
even
thought
of
when
he
came
to
the
room
first
well
here
it
is
and
now
for
the
point
i
was
going
to
tell
you
when
i
came
in
we
have
tea
dear
said
edith
oh
surely
not
it
only
just
four
i
do
think
it
good
for
the
servants
having
tea
earlier
than
usual
it
a
little
thing
yes
i
know
that
but
i
do
believe
in
it
i
like
punctuality
regularity
oh
well
of
course
dear
if
you
wish
it
i
do
at
all
i
thought
you
might
no
i
like
punctuality
er
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
tea
at
the
club
laughing
edith
rang
the
bell
bruce
lighted
a
cigarette
first
with
his
usual
courtesy
asking
her
permission
tell
you
about
when
woodhouse
has
gone
he
said
mysteriously
ca
you
tell
me
anything
about
it
now
i
would
have
ordered
tea
if
i
known
that
he
enjoyed
keeping
her
waiting
and
was
delighted
at
her
interest
he
would
have
made
it
last
longer
but
was
unable
to
bear
his
own
suspense
so
he
said
i
say
any
more
tell
me
where
is
madame
frabelle
chapter
iii
frabelle
in
her
own
room
she
stays
there
a
good
deal
you
know
i
fancy
she
does
it
out
of
tactfulness
edith
spoke
thoughtfully
does
she
do
there
bruce
asked
with
curiosity
as
he
stood
up
and
looked
in
the
glass
says
she
goes
there
to
read
she
thinks
it
bores
people
to
see
a
visitor
sitting
reading
about
the
house
she
says
it
makes
them
get
tired
of
the
sight
of
her
she
ca
be
reading
all
those
hours
surely
and
bruce
sat
down
satisfied
with
his
appearance
would
think
not
i
used
to
think
she
was
probably
lying
on
the
sofa
with
cold
cream
on
her
face
or
something
of
that
sort
but
she
does
once
i
went
in
edith
smiled
found
her
doing
swedish
exercises
heavens
what
a
wonderful
woman
she
is
do
you
mean
to
say
learning
swedish
as
well
as
all
the
other
languages
she
knows
no
i
mean
physical
exercises
but
go
on
bruce
i
getting
so
impatient
bruce
settled
himself
down
comfortably
blew
a
ring
of
smoke
and
then
began
slowly
never
dreamt
edith
bruce
are
you
going
to
tell
me
everything
you
never
dreamt
we
shall
take
weeks
getting
to
the
point
be
absurd
i
get
to
the
point
at
once
then
look
here
i
think
we
ought
to
give
a
dinner
for
madame
frabelle
is
that
all
of
course
i
been
wondering
that
you
did
wish
to
do
it
long
before
now
you
i
tell
you
why
thinking
madame
frabelle
was
a
pal
er
a
friend
of
the
conroys
it
stood
to
reason
do
you
see
that
she
knew
everyone
in
london
or
could
if
she
liked
everyone
worth
knowing
i
mean
under
these
circumstances
there
was
no
point
in
well
in
showing
off
our
friends
to
her
but
i
found
out
only
last
night
he
lowered
his
voice
do
you
think
she
is
an
intimate
friend
of
lady
conroy
at
all
she
only
made
her
acquaintance
in
the
of
the
royal
hotel
two
days
before
she
came
to
london
edith
laughed
delightful
then
why
on
earth
did
lady
conroy
send
her
to
us
with
a
letter
of
introduction
why
just
us
she
likes
you
besides
it
just
like
her
is
it
and
she
never
said
she
had
known
her
all
her
life
we
jumped
to
that
conclusion
it
was
our
own
idea
how
did
you
find
it
out
when
you
went
up
to
the
children
and
left
me
alone
with
madame
frabelle
yesterday
evening
she
told
me
herself
perfectly
frankly
in
her
usual
way
she
always
like
that
so
frank
and
open
besides
she
had
the
slightest
idea
we
did
know
it
hope
you
did
let
her
think
edith
began
as
if
i
would
well
that
being
so
he
lit
another
cigarette
under
the
circumstances
i
want
to
ask
some
people
to
meet
her
see
seems
very
happy
with
us
alone
does
she
not
as
if
she
cared
much
for
going
out
i
know
that
all
very
well
but
i
do
want
her
to
think
we
do
know
anyone
and
it
seems
a
bit
selfish
too
keeping
her
all
to
ourselves
like
this
do
you
want
her
to
meet
dear
want
her
to
meet
the
mitchells
said
bruce
only
a
chance
of
course
that
she
has
met
them
already
here
and
i
told
mitchell
at
the
foreign
office
a
good
deal
about
her
he
very
keen
to
know
her
very
keen
indeed
he
added
thoughtfully
then
the
mitchells
will
ask
her
to
their
house
of
course
know
they
will
said
bruce
rather
jealously
i
sha
mind
her
going
there
once
or
twice
it
a
very
pleasant
house
you
know
edith
and
she
likes
celebrities
and
clever
people
and
that
sort
of
thing
mitchell
will
count
her
as
one
no
doubt
daresay
what
does
that
matter
so
she
is
know
she
is
in
a
way
but
bruce
do
you
wonder
why
she
stays
here
so
long
i
mean
there
no
question
of
its
not
being
for
well
for
say
interested
reasons
i
happen
to
know
for
a
fact
that
she
has
a
far
larger
income
for
herself
alone
than
we
have
altogether
she
showed
me
her
one
day
do
know
she
so
confidential
and
perhaps
she
wanted
me
to
know
how
she
was
placed
and
she
not
that
sort
of
person
she
generous
and
liberal
rather
extravagant
i
should
say
so
still
it
comfortable
here
and
saves
trouble
and
she
likes
us
bruce
again
looked
up
toward
the
mirror
though
he
could
see
it
now
i
do
mind
her
being
here
it
a
nice
change
but
it
seems
odd
she
has
said
a
word
about
going
well
about
the
dinner
who
else
shall
we
have
edith
let
it
be
a
small
intimate
distinguished
sort
of
dinner
she
hates
stiffness
and
ceremony
she
likes
to
have
a
chance
to
talk
does
indeed
all
right
you
can
leave
it
to
me
bruce
i
make
it
all
right
we
have
about
eight
people
shall
we
must
sit
next
to
me
on
my
left
bruce
observed
not
lilies
of
the
valley
she
does
like
the
scent
madame
frabelle
was
usually
designated
between
them
by
the
personal
pronoun
only
right
but
what
was
the
delicate
difficult
matter
that
someone
consulted
you
about
bruce
i
was
just
coining
to
that
hush
the
door
opened
madame
frabelle
came
in
dressed
in
a
violet
said
edith
holding
out
a
cup
indeed
i
always
ready
for
tea
and
you
have
such
delightful
tea
edith
dear
they
had
already
reached
the
point
of
christian
names
though
edith
always
found
eglantine
a
little
difficult
to
say
nice
to
see
you
back
so
early
mr
ottley
you
like
a
slice
of
lemon
said
bruce
to
offer
her
a
slice
of
lemon
with
tea
was
from
bruce
a
tribute
to
the
lady
talents
no
cream
and
sugar
please
madame
frabelle
was
looking
very
pleasant
and
very
much
at
her
ease
as
she
sat
down
comfortably
taking
the
largest
chair
afraid
that
archie
has
been
bothering
you
today
edith
said
as
she
poured
out
tea
exclaimed
bruce
with
a
start
of
horror
no
no
no
not
the
least
in
the
world
mr
ottley
he
a
most
delightful
boy
we
were
only
having
some
fun
together
about
my
mandolin
that
was
all
edith
thought
of
the
sounds
she
had
heard
on
the
stairs
afraid
i
got
a
little
cross
a
thing
i
very
seldom
do
madame
frabelle
looked
apologetically
at
edith
we
quite
made
it
up
now
oh
and
by
the
way
i
want
to
speak
to
you
both
rather
seriously
about
your
boy
she
went
on
earnestly
she
had
a
rather
powerful
clear
penetrating
voice
and
spoke
with
authority
decision
and
the
sort
of
voluble
fluency
generally
known
as
not
letting
anyone
else
get
a
word
in
edgeways
our
boy
said
bruce
handing
the
toast
to
her
invitingly
while
edith
put
a
cushion
behind
her
back
for
which
madame
frabelle
gave
a
little
gracious
smile
your
boy
do
you
know
i
have
a
very
curious
gift
mr
ottley
i
can
always
see
in
children
what
they
going
to
make
a
success
of
in
life
without
boasting
i
know
you
edith
are
kind
enough
to
believe
that
i
an
extraordinary
judge
of
character
oh
i
always
been
like
that
i
ca
help
it
i
tell
you
now
what
you
must
make
of
your
boy
she
pursued
is
a
born
musician
musician
exclaimed
both
his
parents
at
once
in
great
astonishment
madame
frabelle
nodded
boy
is
a
born
composer
he
has
genius
for
music
look
at
his
broad
forehead
those
grey
eyes
so
wide
apart
i
know
just
at
first
one
thinks
too
much
from
the
worldly
point
of
view
of
the
success
of
one
son
in
life
but
why
go
against
nature
the
boy
a
genius
ventured
edith
has
the
slightest
ear
for
music
dislikes
music
intensely
said
bruce
loathes
it
cried
so
much
over
his
piano
lessons
that
we
were
obliged
to
let
him
give
them
up
it
used
to
make
him
quite
ill
and
his
music
mistress
too
edith
said
remember
she
left
the
last
time
in
hysterics
by
jove
i
remember
too
pretty
girl
she
was
she
had
a
nervous
breakdown
afterwards
said
bruce
rather
proudly
dear
you
thinking
of
the
other
one
the
woman
who
began
to
teach
him
the
violin
am
i
madame
frabelle
nodded
her
head
with
a
smile
on
earth
to
do
with
it
my
dear
the
boy
a
born
composer
all
the
same
with
that
face
he
must
be
a
musician
funny
he
hates
it
so
said
bruce
thoughtfully
still
i
have
no
doubt
me
you
ca
go
by
his
not
liking
his
lessons
assured
madame
frabelle
as
she
ate
a
muffin
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
at
all
the
young
mozart
i
thought
he
played
the
piano
when
he
was
only
three
i
mean
or
was
it
meyerbeer
at
any
rate
you
see
i
right
really
think
we
ought
to
force
him
against
his
will
to
study
music
seriously
with
the
idea
of
his
being
a
composer
when
he
grows
up
though
he
detests
it
asked
his
mother
madame
frabelle
turned
to
edith
you
feel
proud
when
you
see
your
son
conducting
his
own
opera
to
the
applause
of
thousands
wo
it
be
something
to
be
the
mother
of
the
greatest
english
composer
of
the
twentieth
century
would
be
rather
fun
sha
hear
quite
so
much
about
strauss
elgar
debussy
and
all
those
people
when
archie
ottley
grows
up
declared
madame
frabelle
hear
very
little
about
them
now
said
bruce
how
should
you
at
the
foreign
office
or
the
or
the
club
asked
edith
bruce
ignored
edith
and
went
on
he
turn
out
to
be
a
lionel
monckton
or
a
paul
rubens
perhaps
he
write
comic
opera
revues
or
musical
comedies
dear
no
said
their
guest
shaking
her
head
decidedly
will
be
the
very
highest
class
the
top
of
the
tree
the
real
thing
frabelle
be
right
you
know
said
bruce
she
leant
back
smiling
i
right
there
simply
no
question
about
it
what
do
you
think
we
ought
to
do
about
it
said
edith
goes
to
a
preparatory
school
now
where
they
do
have
any
music
lessons
at
all
the
better
she
answered
sort
of
lessons
he
would
get
at
a
school
would
be
no
use
to
him
i
should
think
murmured
edith
it
say
for
the
moment
and
when
he
comes
back
for
his
next
holidays
put
him
under
a
good
teacher
a
really
great
man
and
you
see
daresay
we
shall
said
bruce
considerably
relieved
at
the
postponement
though
is
it
his
not
knowing
one
tune
from
another
when
he
a
born
musician
it
flashed
across
edith
what
an
immense
bond
of
sympathy
it
was
between
bruce
and
madame
frabelle
that
neither
of
them
was
burdened
with
the
slightest
sense
of
humour
when
he
presently
went
out
each
of
them
preferred
talking
to
her
alone
and
she
also
enjoyed
a
most
madame
frabelle
drew
up
her
chair
nearer
to
edith
and
said
dear
i
going
to
tell
you
something
do
be
angry
with
me
or
think
me
impertinent
but
you
been
very
kind
to
me
and
i
look
upon
you
as
a
real
friend
very
sweet
of
you
said
edith
feeling
hypnotised
and
as
if
she
would
gladly
devote
her
life
to
madame
frabelle
i
can
see
something
you
are
not
quite
happy
happy
exclaimed
edith
you
have
a
trouble
and
i
give
anything
to
take
it
away
madame
frabelle
looked
at
her
with
sympathy
pressed
her
hand
then
looked
away
edith
knew
she
was
looking
away
out
of
delicacy
delicacy
about
what
it
was
an
effort
not
to
laugh
but
oddly
enough
it
was
also
an
effort
not
to
feel
secretly
miserable
she
wondered
though
what
she
was
unhappy
about
she
need
not
have
troubled
for
madame
frabelle
was
quite
willing
to
tell
her
she
was
indeed
willing
to
tell
anyone
anything
perhaps
that
was
the
secret
of
her
charm
chapter
iv
it
was
utterly
impossible
literally
out
of
the
question
that
madame
frabelle
could
know
anything
about
the
one
trouble
the
one
danger
that
so
narrowly
escaped
being
almost
a
tragedy
in
edith
life
it
was
three
years
since
bruce
always
inclined
to
vague
mild
flirtations
had
been
positively
carried
off
his
feet
and
literally
taken
away
by
a
determined
young
art
student
with
red
hair
who
had
failed
to
marry
a
friend
of
his
while
edith
with
the
children
was
passing
the
summer
holidays
at
westgate
bruce
had
sent
her
the
strangest
of
letters
informing
her
that
he
and
mavis
argles
could
not
live
without
one
another
and
had
gone
to
australia
together
and
imploring
her
to
divorce
him
the
complication
was
increased
by
the
fact
that
at
that
particular
moment
the
most
charming
man
edith
had
ever
met
aylmer
ross
that
eloquent
and
brilliant
barrister
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
and
she
had
become
considerably
attracted
to
him
her
pride
had
been
hurt
at
bruce
conduct
but
she
had
certainly
felt
it
less
bitterly
in
one
way
because
she
was
herself
so
much
fascinated
by
aylmer
and
his
devotion
but
edith
had
behaved
with
cool
courage
and
real
unselfishness
she
felt
certain
that
brace
mania
would
not
last
and
that
if
it
did
he
would
be
miserable
strangely
then
she
had
declined
to
divorce
him
and
waited
her
prophecy
turned
out
correct
and
by
the
time
they
arrived
at
their
journey
end
the
lady
was
engaged
to
a
commercial
traveller
whom
she
met
on
the
boat
by
then
bruce
and
she
were
equally
convinced
that
in
going
to
australia
they
had
decidedly
gone
too
far
so
brace
came
back
and
edith
forgave
him
she
made
one
condition
only
which
was
also
her
one
revenge
that
he
should
never
speak
about
it
never
mention
the
subject
again
aylmer
ross
who
had
taken
his
romance
seriously
to
heart
refused
to
be
kept
as
de
la
maison
and
as
a
platonic
admirer
deeply
disappointed
for
he
was
prepared
to
give
his
life
to
edith
and
her
children
he
was
a
widower
of
independent
means
he
had
left
england
she
had
never
seen
him
since
all
this
had
been
a
real
event
a
real
break
in
edith
life
for
the
first
few
months
after
she
suffered
missing
the
excitement
of
controlled
passion
and
his
congenial
society
gradually
she
made
herself
not
forget
it
but
put
aside
ignore
the
whole
incident
it
gave
her
genuine
satisfaction
to
know
that
she
had
made
a
sacrifice
for
bruce
sake
she
was
aware
that
he
could
not
exist
really
satisfactorily
without
her
though
perhaps
he
did
know
it
he
needed
her
at
first
she
had
endeavoured
to
remain
separated
from
him
while
apparently
living
together
from
who
knows
what
feeling
of
romantic
fidelity
to
aylmer
or
pique
at
the
slight
shown
her
by
her
husband
then
she
found
that
impossible
it
would
make
him
more
liable
to
other
complications
and
the
whole
situation
too
full
of
general
difficulties
so
now
for
the
last
three
years
they
had
been
on
much
the
same
terms
as
they
were
before
bruce
had
become
perhaps
less
patronising
more
respectful
to
her
and
she
a
shade
more
gentle
and
considerate
to
him
as
to
a
child
for
she
was
generous
and
did
not
forgive
by
halves
there
were
moments
of
nervous
irritation
of
course
and
of
sentimental
regret
on
the
whole
though
edith
was
glad
she
had
acted
as
she
did
but
if
occasionally
she
felt
her
life
a
little
dull
and
flat
if
she
missed
some
of
the
excitement
of
that
eventful
year
it
was
impossible
for
anyone
to
see
it
by
her
manner
what
could
madame
frabelle
possibly
know
about
it
what
did
that
lady
really
suppose
was
the
matter
do
you
think
i
unhappy
about
edith
repeated
madame
frabelle
as
has
been
mentioned
was
willing
to
tell
her
she
told
her
as
usual
with
fluency
and
inaccuracy
edith
was
much
amused
to
find
how
strangely
mistaken
was
this
authoritative
lady
as
to
her
intuitions
how
inevitably
with
her
penetrations
and
her
instinctive
guesses
madame
frabelle
said
that
she
believed
edith
was
beginning
to
feel
the
dawn
of
love
for
someone
and
was
struggling
against
it
the
struggle
of
course
in
reality
had
long
been
over
who
was
the
person
have
met
him
yet
madame
frabelle
said
is
there
a
name
i
hear
very
often
your
husband
is
always
talking
about
him
he
told
me
i
was
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
this
great
friend
of
his
something
tells
me
it
is
he
i
shall
know
as
soon
as
i
see
him
you
ca
hide
it
from
me
who
was
the
person
bruce
was
always
mentioning
to
madame
frabelle
certainly
not
aylmer
ross
he
had
apparently
forgotten
his
existence
you
referring
to
madame
frabelle
looked
out
of
the
window
and
nodded
mr
mitchell
edith
started
and
a
smile
curved
her
lips
always
the
husband
great
friend
unfortunately
sighed
eglantine
my
dear
with
the
usual
cheap
knowingness
of
the
cynic
seen
so
much
of
that
now
i
going
to
help
you
i
determined
to
leave
you
two
dear
charming
people
without
a
cloud
when
i
go
not
thinking
of
going
yet
no
not
while
you
let
me
stay
here
dear
i
friends
in
london
and
in
the
country
but
i
have
looked
them
up
or
written
to
them
or
done
anything
since
i
been
here
i
been
too
happy
i
could
be
bothered
i
am
so
interested
in
you
another
thing
may
i
say
for
i
feel
as
if
i
known
you
for
years
you
think
your
husband
does
know
it
you
are
wrong
i
really
last
night
a
certain
look
when
he
spoke
of
the
mitchells
showed
me
that
bruce
is
terribly
jealous
he
does
show
it
but
he
is
mrs
mitchell
suggested
edith
one
of
our
best
friends
a
dear
thing
by
the
way
we
asking
them
to
dine
with
us
on
tuesday
delighted
to
hear
it
i
shall
understand
everything
then
is
it
curious
without
even
seeing
them
that
i
know
all
about
it
i
think
i
a
touch
of
second
sight
eglantine
are
you
going
a
little
far
had
you
better
wait
until
you
seen
them
at
least
you
no
idea
how
well
the
mitchells
get
on
no
doubt
of
it
she
replied
of
course
i
do
know
that
he
mr
mitchell
i
mean
even
realises
what
you
are
to
him
but
do
edith
was
really
impressed
at
the
dash
with
which
madame
frabelle
so
broadly
handled
this
vague
theme
till
you
do
see
them
she
said
rather
mischievously
declining
to
deny
her
friend
suggestion
altogether
i
should
have
guessed
it
is
it
madame
frabelle
was
evidently
pleased
admit
this
edith
from
what
your
husband
says
i
gather
you
see
each
other
continually
do
you
often
and
he
are
together
at
the
foreign
office
bruce
thinks
much
of
him
and
admires
him
with
it
all
i
notice
now
and
then
a
tinge
of
bitterness
in
the
way
he
speaks
he
was
describing
their
ball
to
me
the
other
day
and
really
his
description
of
mr
costume
would
have
been
almost
spiteful
in
any
other
man
but
mr
mitchell
is
over
sixty
and
he
was
got
up
as
a
black
poodle
quite
so
but
he
a
man
is
he
and
very
pleasant
and
hospitable
yes
of
course
your
birthday
last
week
that
magnificent
basket
of
flowers
came
from
mr
mitchell
stated
eglantine
from
the
mitchells
rather
but
really
that
nothing
i
think
you
be
a
little
disappointed
if
you
think
he
at
all
of
the
romantic
type
did
think
that
she
answered
though
of
course
she
had
something
told
me
i
do
know
why
that
there
some
strange
attraction
i
never
saw
a
more
perfect
wife
than
you
nor
a
more
perfect
mother
but
these
things
should
be
nipped
in
the
bud
dear
they
get
hold
of
you
sometimes
before
you
know
where
you
are
and
think
she
went
on
with
relish
terrible
it
would
be
practically
to
break
up
two
homes
really
i
must
stop
you
there
cried
edith
do
think
of
elopements
do
you
do
say
that
necessarily
but
i
seen
a
great
deal
of
life
lived
everywhere
and
just
the
very
households
as
we
say
abroad
that
seem
most
calm
and
peaceful
sometimes
it
would
be
anyhow
very
dreadful
would
it
to
live
a
double
life
edith
thought
her
friend
rather
enjoyed
the
idea
but
she
said
do
imagine
i
hope
that
there
anything
in
the
nature
of
an
intrigue
going
on
between
me
and
mr
mitchell
no
no
not
now
not
yet
but
you
do
quite
know
edith
how
one
can
be
carried
away
as
i
was
sitting
up
in
my
room
thinking
think
too
much
interrupted
edith
so
but
it
came
to
me
like
this
i
mean
to
be
the
one
to
put
things
right
again
if
i
can
my
dear
child
a
woman
of
the
world
like
myself
sees
things
you
two
ought
to
be
ideally
happy
you
meant
for
one
another
i
mean
you
and
bruce
you
think
so
but
this
what
shall
i
say
this
fascination
is
coming
between
you
and
though
you
do
realise
it
it
saddening
life
it
will
sadden
yours
too
at
first
no
doubt
at
the
stage
in
dear
it
seems
all
romance
and
excitement
but
later
on
now
edith
promise
me
you
wo
be
angry
with
me
for
what
i
said
it
a
terrible
freedom
that
i
taken
i
know
really
a
liberty
but
if
i
were
your
she
glanced
at
the
mirror
sister
i
could
be
fonder
of
you
do
think
i
a
horrid
interfering
old
thing
will
you
i
do
you
a
dear
we
wo
speak
of
it
any
more
till
after
tuesday
said
madame
frabelle
take
my
advice
throw
yourself
into
other
things
she
glanced
round
the
room
a
splendid
idea
to
divert
your
thoughts
why
do
you
refurnish
your
boudoir
edith
had
often
noticed
the
strange
lack
in
eglantine
of
any
sense
of
decoration
she
dressed
charmingly
but
with
regard
to
surroundings
she
was
entirely
devoid
of
taste
she
had
the
curious
provincialism
so
often
seen
in
cosmopolitans
who
have
lived
most
of
their
lives
in
hotels
without
apparently
noticing
or
caring
about
their
surroundings
edith
made
rather
a
hobby
of
decoration
and
she
had
a
cultured
and
quiet
taste
and
much
knowledge
on
the
subject
she
guessed
madame
frabelle
thought
her
rooms
too
plain
too
colourless
instead
of
the
dull
greys
and
blues
and
surfaces
without
design
she
felt
sure
her
friend
would
have
preferred
gorgeous
patterns
and
even
a
good
deal
of
gilt
probably
at
heart
madame
frabelle
ideal
was
the
crimson
plush
and
stamped
leather
and
fancy
ceilings
of
the
lounge
in
a
foreign
hotel
rather
like
my
room
you
know
said
edith
so
do
i
it
very
charming
but
a
change
dear
a
change
of
as
we
say
abroad
would
do
you
good
we
must
really
think
that
out
said
edith
right
and
you
not
cross
i
do
know
when
i
enjoyed
a
conversation
so
much
said
edith
speaking
with
perfect
truth
chapter
v
the
ottleys
and
madame
frabelle
were
in
the
awaiting
their
guests
i
say
advisedly
their
guests
for
could
help
regarding
madame
frabelle
as
essentially
the
hostess
and
queen
of
the
evening
one
would
fancy
that
instead
of
entertaining
more
or
less
for
the
last
twelve
years
the
young
couple
had
never
given
a
dinner
before
so
much
suppressed
excitement
was
in
the
air
bruce
was
quiet
and
subdued
now
from
combined
nervousness
and
pride
but
for
the
few
days
previous
he
had
been
terribly
trying
to
his
unfortunate
wife
nothing
according
to
him
could
be
good
enough
for
the
purpose
of
impressing
madame
frabelle
and
he
appeared
to
have
lost
all
his
confidence
in
edith
undeniable
gift
for
receiving
the
flowers
the
menu
the
arrangement
of
the
eight
people
for
the
dinner
was
still
small
intimate
and
distinguished
as
he
had
first
suggested
had
been
subjected
to
continual
and
maddening
changes
in
its
scheme
everyone
had
been
disengaged
and
everyone
had
accepted
then
he
wished
he
had
asked
other
people
instead
when
edith
was
dressed
bruce
put
the
last
touch
to
his
irritating
caprices
by
asking
edith
to
take
out
of
her
hair
a
bandeau
of
blue
that
he
had
first
asked
her
to
put
in
every
woman
will
know
what
agony
that
must
have
caused
the
pretty
fair
hair
was
waved
and
arranged
specially
for
this
ornament
and
when
she
took
it
out
the
whole
scheme
seemed
to
her
wrong
however
she
looked
very
pretty
dressed
in
vaporous
tulle
of
a
shade
of
blue
which
only
a
faultless
complexion
can
bear
edith
complexion
was
her
strong
point
when
she
was
a
little
flushed
she
looked
all
the
better
for
it
and
when
she
was
pale
it
seemed
to
suit
her
none
the
worse
hers
was
the
sort
of
skin
with
a
satiny
texture
that
improves
under
bright
sunshine
or
electric
light
in
fact
the
more
brilliantly
it
was
lighted
the
better
it
looked
madame
frabelle
of
course
was
dressed
in
black
and
with
a
good
deal
of
jet
a
black
aigrette
like
a
lightning
conductor
stood
up
defiantly
in
her
hair
though
it
did
not
harmonise
well
with
the
somewhat
square
and
shape
of
her
head
and
face
and
appeared
to
have
dropped
on
her
by
accident
yet
as
a
symbol
of
smartness
it
gave
her
a
kind
of
distinction
it
appeared
to
have
fallen
from
the
skies
it
was
put
on
in
the
wrong
place
and
it
did
not
nestle
as
it
should
do
and
appear
to
grow
out
of
the
hair
since
that
glory
of
womanhood
in
her
case
of
a
dull
brown
going
slightly
grey
was
smooth
scarce
and
plainly
parted
madame
frabelle
really
would
have
looked
her
best
in
a
cap
of
the
fashion
of
the
sixties
but
she
could
carry
off
anything
and
some
people
said
that
she
did
edith
had
been
allowed
by
her
husband
in
the
decoration
of
their
house
this
was
fortunate
as
was
a
great
gift
of
hers
had
such
a
sense
as
edith
for
arranging
a
room
she
had
struck
the
happy
mean
between
the
eccentric
and
the
conventional
anything
that
seemed
unusual
did
not
appear
to
be
a
pose
or
a
strained
attempt
at
being
different
from
others
but
seemed
to
have
a
reason
of
its
own
for
example
she
greatly
disliked
the
usual
gorgeous
and
dark
conventional
the
room
in
which
she
received
her
guests
was
soft
and
subdued
in
colour
and
not
dazzling
with
that
blaze
of
light
that
is
so
trying
to
strangers
just
arrived
and
not
knowing
their
way
about
a
house
or
certain
of
how
they
are
looking
the
room
seemed
to
receive
them
kindly
make
them
comfortable
and
at
their
ease
hoping
they
looked
their
best
the
shaded
lights
not
dim
enough
to
be
depressing
were
kind
to
those
past
youth
and
gave
confidence
to
the
shy
there
was
nothing
ceremonious
nothing
chilly
about
the
it
was
essentially
at
once
comfortable
and
becoming
and
the
lights
shone
like
shaded
sunshine
from
the
dull
pink
corners
of
the
room
on
the
other
hand
the
helped
conversation
by
its
stimulating
gaiety
and
daintiness
the
feminine
curves
of
the
furniture
such
as
is
usually
kept
for
the
were
all
pure
it
was
deliriously
pretty
in
its
pink
and
white
and
pale
green
in
the
the
hosts
stood
by
one
of
those
large
oaken
fireplaces
so
supremely
helpful
to
conversation
and
in
edith
house
there
was
never
any
general
conversation
except
at
dinner
people
simply
made
friends
flirted
and
enjoyed
themselves
as
the
clock
struck
eight
the
mitchells
were
announced
edith
could
scarcely
control
a
laugh
as
mr
mitchell
came
in
he
looked
so
utterly
unlike
the
dangerous
lover
madame
frabelle
had
conjured
up
he
was
immensely
tall
broad
loosely
built
with
a
red
beard
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
and
the
merriest
of
laughs
he
was
a
delightful
man
but
there
was
no
romance
about
him
besides
edith
remembered
him
as
a
black
poodle
mitchell
struck
a
useful
note
and
seemed
a
perfect
complement
to
her
husband
the
ideal
wife
for
him
she
was
about
but
being
slim
animated
and
well
dressed
though
entirely
without
she
seemed
a
good
deal
younger
mitchell
might
have
been
any
age
between
sixty
and
and
had
the
high
spirits
and
vitality
of
a
boy
it
was
impossible
to
help
liking
this
delightful
couple
they
fully
deserved
their
popularity
in
the
enormous
house
at
hampstead
arranged
like
a
country
mansion
where
they
lived
mitchell
made
it
the
object
of
his
life
to
collect
bohemians
as
other
people
collect
venetian
glass
from
pure
love
of
the
material
his
wife
with
a
silly
subtlety
having
rather
lower
ideals
that
is
to
say
a
touch
of
the
very
human
vulgarity
known
as
social
ambition
made
use
of
his
bohemianism
to
help
her
on
in
her
mundane
success
this
was
the
principle
of
the
thing
if
things
were
well
done
and
they
always
were
at
her
house
would
not
a
duke
if
he
were
musical
go
anywhere
to
hear
the
greatest
tenor
in
europe
and
would
not
all
the
greatest
celebrities
go
anywhere
to
meet
a
duke
next
the
two
young
conistons
were
announced
miss
coniston
was
a
thin
amiable
artistic
girl
who
did
tooling
in
leather
made
her
own
dresses
recited
and
had
a
pale
too
disquieting
young
brother
of
who
seemed
to
be
always
going
out
when
other
people
came
in
but
was
rather
useful
in
society
being
musical
and
very
polite
the
music
that
he
chose
generally
gave
his
audience
a
shock
being
so
young
so
pale
and
so
contemporary
one
expected
him
to
sing
thin
elusive
music
by
debussy
fauré
or
ravel
he
seemed
never
to
have
heard
of
these
composers
but
sang
instead
threatening
songs
such
as
sing
thee
songs
of
araby
or
defiant
teetotal
melodies
like
to
me
only
with
thine
eyes
his
voice
was
good
and
louder
and
deeper
than
one
would
expect
he
accompanied
himself
and
his
sister
everywhere
she
by
the
way
to
add
to
the
interest
about
her
was
said
to
be
privately
engaged
to
a
celebrity
who
was
never
there
alice
and
guy
coniston
were
orphans
and
lived
alone
in
a
tiny
flat
in
pelham
gardens
he
had
been
reading
for
the
bar
but
when
the
war
broke
out
he
joined
the
new
army
and
was
now
in
khaki
but
the
and
great
interest
of
the
evening
was
the
arrival
of
sir
tito
landi
that
most
popular
of
all
italian
composers
with
his
white
moustache
pink
and
white
complexion
and
large
bright
blue
eyes
his
dandified
dress
his
eyeglass
and
buttonhole
he
had
the
fresh
fair
look
of
an
englishman
the
dry
brilliance
of
a
parisian
the
of
a
genius
the
manners
of
a
courtier
and
behind
it
all
the
diabolic
humour
of
the
neapolitan
he
was
small
thin
and
slight
with
a
curious
dignity
of
movement
tito
cried
bruce
cordially
you
are
the
dinner
was
bright
and
gay
from
the
very
beginning
even
before
the
first
glass
of
champagne
it
began
with
an
optimistic
view
of
the
war
then
dropping
the
grave
subject
they
talked
of
people
theatres
books
and
general
gossip
in
all
these
things
madame
frabelle
took
the
lead
indeed
she
had
begun
at
once
laying
down
the
law
in
a
musical
voice
but
with
a
determined
manner
that
gave
those
who
knew
her
to
understand
only
too
well
that
she
intended
to
go
steadily
on
and
certainly
not
to
stop
to
breathe
before
the
ices
sir
tito
landi
fixing
his
eyeglass
in
his
bright
blue
eye
took
in
madame
frabelle
in
one
long
look
and
smiled
at
her
sympathetically
do
you
think
of
her
murmured
edith
to
landi
hypnotised
and
slightly
puzzled
as
she
was
by
her
guest
she
was
particularly
curious
for
his
opinion
as
she
knew
him
to
be
the
best
judge
of
character
of
her
acquaintance
he
had
some
of
the
capriciousness
of
the
spoilt
successful
artist
which
showed
itself
except
to
those
whom
he
regarded
as
real
friends
in
odd
variations
of
manner
so
that
edith
could
not
tell
at
all
by
his
being
extremely
charming
to
madame
frabelle
that
he
liked
her
or
by
his
being
abrupt
and
satirical
that
he
did
an
old
friend
and
a
favourite
she
could
rely
on
what
he
told
her
une
bonne
vieille
he
said
mais
bête
edith
asked
surprised
landi
laughed
comme
ses
pieds
ma
chère
returning
to
decent
language
and
conventional
tone
he
went
on
with
a
story
he
was
telling
about
an
incident
that
had
happened
when
he
was
staying
with
some
royalties
his
stories
were
short
new
amusing
and
invariably
suited
to
his
audience
anything
about
the
court
he
saw
at
a
glance
would
genuinely
interest
madame
frabelle
edith
was
amused
as
she
saw
that
lady
becoming
more
and
more
convinced
of
importance
and
of
his
respectful
admiration
long
before
dinner
was
over
there
was
no
doubt
that
everyone
was
delighted
with
madame
frabelle
she
talked
so
well
suited
herself
to
everyone
and
simply
charmed
them
all
yet
why
edith
was
still
wondering
but
by
the
time
she
rose
to
go
upstairs
she
thought
she
began
to
understand
her
friend
secret
people
were
not
charmed
with
eglantine
because
she
herself
was
charming
but
because
she
was
charmed
madame
frabelle
was
really
as
much
interested
in
everyone
to
whom
she
spoke
as
she
appeared
to
be
the
interest
was
not
assumed
a
few
little
pretences
and
affectations
she
might
have
such
as
that
of
knowing
a
great
deal
about
every
subject
under
the
sun
of
having
read
everything
and
been
everywhere
but
her
interest
in
other
people
was
real
that
was
what
made
people
like
her
young
coniston
shy
sensitive
and
reserved
as
he
was
had
nevertheless
told
her
all
about
his
training
at
braintree
the
boredom
of
getting
up
early
the
dampness
of
the
tents
and
how
much
he
wanted
to
be
sent
to
the
front
she
admired
his
valour
was
interested
in
his
music
and
at
her
persuasion
he
promised
to
sing
her
songs
of
araby
after
dinner
when
the
ladies
were
alone
eglantine
universal
fascination
was
even
more
remarkable
mitchell
at
her
desire
gave
her
the
address
of
the
little
dressmaker
who
ran
up
mitchell
blouses
and
skirts
this
was
an
honour
for
mitchell
nothing
pleased
her
so
much
as
to
be
asked
for
the
address
of
her
dressmaker
by
a
woman
with
a
foreign
name
as
to
miss
coniston
she
was
enraptured
with
eglantine
madame
frabelle
arranged
to
go
and
see
her
little
exhibition
of
tooled
leather
and
coaxed
out
of
the
shy
girl
various
details
about
the
celebrity
who
at
present
had
an
ambulance
in
france
she
adored
reciting
and
miss
coniston
to
gratify
her
offered
to
recite
a
poem
by
emile
cammaerts
on
the
spot
as
to
mitchell
madame
frabelle
drew
him
out
with
more
care
and
caution
with
the
obstinacy
of
the
mistaken
she
still
saw
in
mitchell
friendly
looks
at
his
hostess
a
passion
for
edith
and
shook
her
grey
head
over
the
blindness
of
the
poor
dear
wife
bruce
hung
on
her
words
and
was
while
she
spoke
so
impressed
was
he
at
her
wonderful
cleverness
and
at
her
evident
success
with
his
friends
later
on
landi
sitting
in
the
with
edith
said
as
he
puffed
a
cigar
ma
chère
edith
tu
ne
vois
pas
quelque
chose
he
always
talked
french
as
a
middle
course
between
italian
and
english
and
edith
spoke
her
own
language
to
him
la
mère
frabelle
he
laughed
to
himself
est
folle
de
ton
mari
really
landi
that
your
fancy
he
mimicked
her
farncy
je
me
suis
monté
un
rien
de
fièvre
sans
doute
une
idée
que
comme
ça
eh
bien
non
nous
verrons
je
te
dis
est
amoureuse
de
bruce
is
very
devoted
to
her
i
know
said
edith
i
daresay
he
a
little
in
love
with
her
in
a
way
but
she
tout
le
contraire
chère
lui
moins
il
est
flatté
il
la
trouve
une
femme
intelligente
he
laughed
elle
tu
est
folle
de
ne
pas
voir
ça
edith
enfin
si
ça
with
a
laugh
he
got
up
to
loud
applause
and
went
to
the
little
white
enamelled
piano
there
with
a
long
cigar
in
his
mouth
he
struck
a
few
notes
and
at
once
magnetised
his
audience
the
mere
touch
of
his
fingers
on
the
piano
thrilled
everyone
present
he
sang
a
composition
of
his
own
which
even
the
had
never
succeeded
in
making
hackneyed
hiver
and
melodious
as
only
italian
music
can
be
blue
beams
flashed
from
his
eyes
he
seemed
in
a
dream
suddenly
in
the
most
impassioned
part
which
he
was
singing
in
a
composer
voice
that
is
hardly
any
voice
but
with
perfect
art
he
caught
madame
frabelle
eye
and
gave
her
a
solemn
wink
she
burst
out
laughing
he
then
went
on
singing
with
sentiment
and
grace
all
the
women
present
imagined
that
he
was
making
love
to
them
while
each
man
felt
that
he
personally
was
making
love
to
his
ideal
woman
such
was
the
effect
of
landi
music
it
made
the
most
material
even
the
most
unmusical
remember
some
little
romance
some
some
sentiment
of
the
past
landi
seemed
to
get
at
the
soft
spot
in
everybody
heart
all
the
audience
looked
dreamy
edith
was
thinking
of
aylmer
ross
where
was
he
now
would
she
ever
see
him
again
had
she
been
wise
to
throw
away
her
happiness
like
that
she
tried
to
put
the
thought
aside
but
she
observed
with
a
smile
that
madame
frabelle
looked
and
not
when
he
was
looking
at
her
a
shade
tenderly
at
bruce
edith
remembered
what
landi
had
said
ça
she
found
an
opportunity
to
tell
him
that
madame
frabelle
believed
in
her
own
intuitions
and
had
got
it
into
her
head
that
she
and
mitchell
were
attached
to
one
another
elle
veut
la
pauvre
she
really
believes
it
voit
double
alors
exclaimed
landi
chapter
vi
edith
and
madame
frabelle
had
long
talks
next
day
over
the
little
and
the
people
of
their
intimate
circle
whom
she
had
met
she
was
delighted
with
landi
though
a
little
frightened
of
him
as
most
people
were
when
they
first
knew
him
unless
he
really
liked
them
immensely
she
impressed
on
edith
to
beware
of
mitchell
bruce
for
once
had
really
been
satisfied
with
his
own
entertainment
and
declared
to
edith
that
madame
frabelle
had
made
it
go
off
splendidly
edith
was
growing
to
like
her
more
and
more
in
a
house
where
bruce
lived
it
was
certainly
a
wonderful
help
to
have
a
third
person
often
present
if
it
was
the
right
person
the
absurd
irritations
and
scenes
of
that
she
had
become
inured
to
but
which
were
always
trying
were
now
shorter
milder
or
given
up
altogether
bruce
temper
was
perennially
good
and
got
better
then
the
constant
illnesses
that
he
used
to
suffer
from
he
was
unable
to
pass
the
military
examination
and
go
to
the
front
on
account
of
a
neurotic
heart
these
illnesses
were
either
omitted
entirely
or
talked
over
with
madame
frabelle
whose
advice
turned
out
more
successful
than
that
of
a
dozen
specialists
extraordinary
woman
she
is
you
know
edith
he
said
know
that
really
peculiar
feeling
i
sometimes
have
dear
know
that
sort
of
emptiness
in
the
feet
and
heaviness
in
the
head
and
that
curious
kind
of
twitching
of
the
eyelids
that
i
get
i
know
well
dear
madame
frabelle
has
given
me
a
complete
cure
for
it
it
seems
her
husband
by
the
way
what
a
brute
he
must
have
been
and
what
a
life
that
poor
woman
led
however
never
mind
that
now
had
something
very
much
of
the
same
kind
only
not
quite
so
bad
dear
do
you
mean
which
which
what
peculiar
feeling
peculiar
feeling
are
we
talking
about
said
which
peculiar
feeling
did
frabelle
have
are
you
trying
to
get
at
edith
he
looked
at
her
suspiciously
edith
sighed
it
the
heaviness
in
the
feet
or
the
lightness
in
the
head
or
was
it
the
twitching
of
the
eyelid
which
frabelle
used
to
suffer
from
ah
yes
i
see
what
you
mean
it
seemed
he
had
a
little
of
them
all
but
what
do
you
think
she
used
to
do
have
the
slightest
idea
some
stuff
called
tisane
have
you
ever
heard
of
it
bruce
asked
a
simple
remedy
but
a
very
good
thing
well
he
used
to
use
that
he
bathe
his
eye
with
it
my
dear
edith
you
do
pull
yourself
together
he
drank
it
that
what
he
did
and
that
what
i
going
to
do
eg
madame
frabelle
would
go
straight
down
into
the
kitchen
and
show
you
how
to
make
it
if
you
like
do
mind
if
cook
does
said
edith
we
see
about
that
anyway
she
going
to
show
me
how
to
get
it
made
there
another
thing
madame
frabelle
suggested
she
got
an
idea
it
would
do
me
a
world
of
good
to
spend
a
day
in
the
country
really
sounds
a
good
idea
say
on
the
river
she
not
been
there
for
years
it
seems
she
thinks
she
would
rather
enjoy
it
should
think
it
would
be
a
capital
plan
said
edith
how
about
next
saturday
said
bruce
thinking
he
was
concealing
his
eagerness
and
satisfaction
oh
yes
certainly
saturday
by
all
means
if
it
fine
what
time
shall
we
start
he
started
at
once
but
was
silent
yes
edith
went
on
after
a
glance
at
him
i
promised
to
take
the
two
children
to
an
afternoon
performance
you
though
bruce
brightened
up
hard
luck
on
them
to
disappoint
them
mind
you
edith
i
do
believe
in
spoiling
children
i
do
think
their
parents
should
be
absolute
slaves
to
them
but
on
the
other
hand
i
do
think
it
good
for
them
to
disappoint
them
quite
so
much
as
that
and
after
all
well
a
promise
to
a
child
he
shook
his
head
sentimentally
it
a
fad
of
mine
i
daresay
it
is
but
i
do
like
the
idea
of
breaking
a
promise
to
a
child
does
seem
a
shame
too
bad
agree
with
me
i
knew
you
would
i
heard
you
say
the
same
yourself
well
then
look
here
edith
suppose
we
do
it
suppose
you
do
it
i
mean
suppose
you
go
with
archie
and
dilly
they
to
lunch
with
my
mother
are
they
dear
but
we
were
to
have
fetched
them
from
there
and
then
taken
them
on
to
the
theatre
do
it
then
my
dear
girl
stick
to
your
plan
do
let
me
spoil
your
afternoon
gracious
heaven
i
i
why
i
can
quite
well
take
madame
frabelle
myself
he
looked
at
the
barometer
glass
is
going
up
he
said
giving
it
first
a
tap
and
then
a
slight
shake
to
encourage
it
to
go
up
higher
and
to
look
sharp
about
it
that
settled
then
dear
that
fixed
up
i
take
her
on
the
river
i
do
mind
in
the
very
least
i
shall
be
only
too
pleased
delighted
oh
do
thank
me
my
dear
girl
i
know
one
ought
to
put
oneself
out
for
a
guest
especially
a
widow
under
these
circumstances
over
in
england
during
the
war
too
hang
it
it
the
least
one
can
murmurings
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
the
lady
in
question
he
made
the
suggestion
and
explained
the
arrangement
she
consented
immediately
with
much
graciousness
dote
on
the
river
and
have
been
for
years
where
would
you
like
to
go
he
asked
part
of
the
river
do
you
like
how
about
maidenhead
any
part
do
ask
me
anything
you
suggest
is
sure
to
be
right
you
know
far
more
about
these
things
than
i
do
but
maidenhead
is
it
just
a
little
commonplace
a
little
noisy
and
crowded
even
now
jove
yes
you
quite
right
madame
frabelle
perfectly
right
edith
you
know
well
what
about
shepperton
oh
charming
dear
little
town
but
it
is
exactly
what
i
call
the
river
if
you
know
what
i
mean
i
mean
to
say
could
you
suggest
a
place
said
bruce
i
the
worst
person
in
the
world
for
suggesting
anything
said
madame
frabelle
i
know
so
little
of
the
river
but
how
about
kingston
oh
capital
that
would
be
charming
as
it
used
to
be
called
madame
frabelle
hastened
to
show
her
knowledge
the
days
when
saxon
kings
were
crowned
there
am
i
wrong
or
not
oh
surely
yes
was
it
kingston
did
great
caesar
cross
the
river
there
and
the
roman
legions
camp
upon
the
sloping
uplands
bruce
gasped

everything
he
exclaimed
no
i
remember
a
little
about
the
history
she
said
modestly
poor
weak
king
edwy
indeed
said
bruce
though
he
had
no
recollection
of
having
heard
the
gentleman
mentioned
before
chap
bad
murmured
edith
he
must
have
hated
that
place
said
madame
frabelle
i
should
think
so
indeed
wo
said
edith
adroitly
changing
the
subject
seeing
her
husband
getting
deeper
out
of
his
depth
most
of
the
evening
madame
frabelle
read
up
baedeker
to
the
immense
astonishment
of
bruce
who
had
never
before
thought
of
regarding
the
river
from
the
historical
and
geographical
point
of
view
the
next
day
which
was
fine
if
not
warm
the
two
started
off
with
a
certain
amount
of
bustle
and
a
bundle
of
rugs
madame
frabelle
in
a
short
skirt
with
a
maritime
touch
about
the
collar
and
what
she
called
a
suitable
hat
and
a
dark
blue
motor
veil
she
carried
off
the
whole
costume
to
admiration
archie
seemed
rather
bewildered
and
annoyed
at
this
division
of
the
party
mother
we
going
out
to
lunch
with
grandmother
know
darling
i
come
and
fetch
you
from
there
conventional
and
restrained
as
archie
usually
was
he
sometimes
said
curious
things
edith
saw
by
his
dreamy
expression
he
was
going
to
say
one
now
he
looked
at
her
for
a
little
while
after
his
father
departure
and
then
asked
darling
madame
frabelle
a
nice
little
friend
for
father
edith
knew
he
had
often
heard
her
and
the
nurse
or
the
governess
discussing
whether
certain
children
were
nice
little
friends
for
him
or
dilly
yes
dear
very
nice
the
cook
came
in
for
orders
going
to
lunch
all
alone
then
are
you
mother
i
suppose
i
must
i
do
mind
i
got
a
nice
book
archie
walked
slowly
to
the
door
then
said
in
a
tone
of
envious
admiration
which
contained
a
note
of
regret
suppose
you
order
a
delicious
pudding
she
went
to
fetch
the
children
who
were
excited
at
the
prospect
of
a
theatre
the
elder
mrs
ottley
was
a
pleasant
woman
who
understood
and
was
utterly
devoted
to
her
fond
as
she
was
of
her
son
she
marvelled
at
edith
patience
and
loved
her
as
much
as
she
loved
bruce
though
she
had
never
been
told
for
she
was
the
sort
of
woman
who
does
not
require
to
be
told
things
in
order
to
know
them
she
knew
every
detail
of
the
sacrifice
edith
had
once
made
she
had
been
almost
as
charmed
by
aylmer
ross
as
her
was
and
she
had
considered
edith
action
nearly
sublime
but
she
had
never
believed
edith
was
at
that
time
really
in
love
with
aylmer
she
had
said
after
bruce
return
must
happen
again
you
know
edith
must
spoil
bruce
you
made
it
almost
too
easy
for
him
do
let
him
think
he
can
always
be
running
away
and
coming
back
never
again
edith
had
answered
with
a
laugh
now
they
never
spoke
of
the
subject
it
was
a
painful
one
to
mrs
ottley
today
that
lady
seemed
inclined
to
detain
edith
and
make
her
as
archie
feared
late
for
the
rising
of
the
curtain
really
like
madame
frabelle
so
much
dear
i
do
said
edith
more
i
know
her
the
more
i
like
her
she
the
most
jolly
kind
woman
i
ever
seen
landi
likes
her
too
that
a
good
sign
she
keeps
bruce
in
a
good
temper
said
mrs
ottley
slyly
why
should
she
i
not
afraid
of
madame
frabelle
edith
said
laughing
all
bruce
may
be
but
she
fifty
a
wonderful
woman
admitted
ottley
who
had
at
first
disliked
her
but
had
come
round
like
everyone
else
very
nice
and
really
i
do
like
her
but
you
know
my
ideas
i
never
approve
of
a
third
person
living
with
a
married
couple
living
she
only
been
with
us
about
a
month
you
do
think
she
going
away
before
the
end
of
the
season
ca
call
it
a
season
and
she
ca
easily
settle
down
just
now
on
account
of
the
war
many
of
her
relations
are
abroad
and
some
in
the
country
she
has
made
up
her
mind
where
to
live
yet
she
has
never
had
a
house
of
her
own
since
her
husband
died
i
see
come
mother
urged
archie
right
darling
i
have
to
take
my
hat
off
pouted
dilly
who
had
on
a
new
hat
with
daisies
round
it
in
which
she
looked
like
a
baby
angel
she
had
a
great
objection
to
removing
it
dear
why
should
you
mind
hair
will
be
all
anyhow
if
i
have
to
take
it
off
in
the
theatre
said
dilly
be
a
silly
little
ass
archie
murmured
to
his
sister
in
some
countries
women
would
be
sent
to
prison
unless
they
took
their
hats
off
at
a
play
the
three
reached
the
theatre
in
what
even
archie
called
good
time
this
meant
to
be
alone
in
the
dark
gloomy
theatre
for
at
least
twenty
minutes
present
as
yet
except
two
or
three
people
eating
oranges
in
the
gallery
he
liked
to
be
the
first
and
the
last
edith
was
fancying
to
herself
how
madame
frabelle
would
lay
down
the
law
about
the
history
of
kingston
and
read
portions
of
the
aloud
while
bruce
was
pointing
out
the
scenery
the
entertainment
which
was
all
odds
and
ends
entertained
the
children
but
rather
bored
her
archie
was
learning
by
heart
which
was
a
way
he
had
the
words
of
a
favourite
song
now
being
sung
kitty
is
it
a
pity
in
the
city
you
work
so
hard
with
your
one
two
three
four
five
six
three
seven
five
cerrard
kitty
kitty
is
it
a
pity
that
you
wasting
so
much
time
with
your
lips
close
to
the
telephone
when
they
might
be
close
to
when
edith
eye
was
suddenly
attracted
by
the
appearance
of
a
boy
in
khakis
who
was
in
a
box
to
her
right
he
looked
about
seventeen
and
was
tall
and
but
what
struck
her
about
him
was
his
remarkable
likeness
in
appearance
and
in
movement
to
aylmer
ross
even
his
back
reminded
her
strongly
of
her
hero
there
was
something
familiar
in
the
thick
broad
shoulders
in
the
cool
ease
of
manner
and
in
the
expression
of
the
face
but
could
that
young
man
why
of
course
it
was
three
years
ago
when
she
parted
with
aylmer
ross
teddy
was
fourteen
these
years
made
a
great
difference
and
of
course
all
plans
had
been
changed
on
account
of
the
war
aylmer
she
thought
was
too
old
to
have
been
at
the
front
the
boy
must
be
in
the
new
army
she
watched
him
perpetually
she
felt
a
longing
to
go
and
speak
to
him
after
a
while
as
though
attracted
by
her
interest
he
turned
round
and
looked
her
straight
in
the
face
how
thrilled
she
felt
at
this
likeness
they
were
the
very
last
to
go
out
and
edith
contrived
to
be
near
the
party
in
the
box
she
dropped
something
and
the
young
man
picked
it
up
she
had
never
seen
him
and
yet
she
felt
she
knew
him
when
he
smiled
she
could
not
resist
speaking
to
him
you
excuse
me
are
you
the
son
of
aylmer
ross
am
and
i
know
you
quite
well
by
your
photograph
he
said
in
exactly
aylmer
pleasant
casual
voice
were
a
great
friend
of
my
father
were
you
where
are
you
now
he
was
at
aldershot
but
was
in
town
on
leave
where
your
father
you
know
my
father
at
the
front
he
coming
over
on
leave
too
in
a
fortnight
and
are
you
still
at
jermyn
street
yes
father
let
his
house
for
three
years
but
we
come
back
again
jolly
little
house
is
it
and
i
hope
we
shall
see
you
both
said
edith
conventionally
the
boy
bowed
smiled
and
walked
away
so
quickly
that
archie
had
no
time
for
the
salute
he
had
prepared
he
was
wonderfully
like
aylmer
edith
was
curiously
pleased
and
excited
about
this
little
incident
chapter
vii
madame
frabelle
and
bruce
arrived
at
waterloo
in
good
time
for
the
train
which
bruce
had
discovered
in
the
abc
they
wished
to
know
where
it
started
but
nobody
appeared
interested
in
the
subject
guards
and
porters
of
whom
they
inquired
seemed
surprised
at
their
questions
and
behaved
as
if
they
regarded
them
as
signs
of
vulgar
and
impertinent
curiosity
at
waterloo
seems
to
know
when
a
train
is
going
to
start
where
it
is
starting
from
or
where
it
is
going
to
madame
frabelle
unconsciously
assumed
an
air
of
embarrassment
as
though
she
had
no
responsibility
for
the
queries
and
excited
manner
of
her
companion
she
seemed
indeed
surprised
when
bruce
asked
to
see
the
here
things
came
to
a
head
there
was
no
train
for
kingston
at
the
one
at
that
hour
was
the
southampton
express
and
it
was
worse
than
useless
for
bruce
and
madame
frabelle
the
abc
and
bradshaw
must
both
be
wrong
said
bruce
reproachfully
to
madame
frabelle
an
idea
occurred
to
that
resourceful
lady
the
was
only
to
start
on
other
days
not
on
saturdays
she
turned
out
to
be
right
however
they
discovered
a
train
at
twenty
minutes
to
twelve
which
would
take
them
where
they
wanted
though
it
was
not
mentioned
apparently
in
any
timetable
and
could
only
be
discovered
by
accident
by
someone
who
was
looking
for
something
else
they
hung
about
the
station
until
it
arrived
feeling
awkward
and
uncomfortable
as
people
do
when
they
have
arrived
too
early
for
a
train
meanwhile
they
abused
bradshaw
and
discussed
the
weather
bruce
said
how
wonderful
it
was
how
some
people
always
knew
what
sort
of
weather
it
was
going
to
be
madame
frabelle
who
was
getting
sufficiently
irritable
to
be
epigrammatic
said
that
she
never
cared
to
know
what
the
weather
was
going
to
be
the
weather
in
england
was
generally
bad
enough
when
it
came
without
the
added
misery
of
knowing
about
it
beforehand
bruce
complained
that
she
was
too
continental
he
very
nearly
said
that
if
she
did
like
england
he
wondered
she
had
remained
in
france
but
he
stopped
himself
at
last
the
train
arrived
bruce
had
settled
his
companion
with
her
back
to
the
engine
in
a
corner
of
a
carriage
and
placed
her
rugs
in
the
rack
above
as
they
will
on
certain
days
every
little
thing
went
wrong
and
the
bundle
promptly
fell
off
as
she
moved
to
catch
it
it
tumbled
on
to
her
hat
nearly
crushing
the
crown
unconsciously
assuming
the
expression
of
a
christian
martyr
madame
frabelle
said
it
matter
bruce
had
given
her
and
london
to
occupy
the
minutes
or
so
while
they
waited
for
the
train
to
start
the
journey
itself
was
much
shorter
than
this
interval
knowing
her
varied
interests
he
felt
sure
that
these
journals
would
pretty
well
cover
the
ground
but
he
was
rather
surprised
as
he
took
the
seat
opposite
her
to
see
that
she
read
first
in
fact
instantly
started
with
apparent
interest
on
london
with
a
quick
glance
he
saw
that
she
was
enjoying
everybody
wants
to
know
the
earl
of
blank
looked
so
surprised
when
he
met
the
pretty
little
blonde
lady
who
had
been
said
to
be
the
friend
of
his
wife
walking
in
bond
street
with
a
certain
dark
gentleman
who
until
now
he
had
always
understood
to
be
her
and
so
forth
as
an
example
to
her
he
took
up
new
and
read
a
serious
article
when
they
arrived
it
was
fine
and
sunny
and
they
looked
at
once
for
a
boat
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
before
that
there
would
be
any
difficulty
in
getting
one
he
imagined
a
smart
new
boat
all
ready
for
him
with
fresh
gay
cushions
and
everything
complete
and
suitable
to
himself
and
his
companion
he
was
rather
irritated
when
he
found
instead
that
the
best
they
could
do
for
him
was
to
give
him
a
thing
like
an
old
chest
which
was
to
be
charged
rather
heavily
for
the
time
they
meant
to
spend
on
the
river
it
looked
far
from
safe
but
it
was
all
they
could
do
so
they
got
in
bruce
meant
to
show
his
powers
as
an
oarsman
he
said
madame
frabelle
must
steer
and
asked
her
to
trim
the
boat
in
obedience
to
his
order
she
sat
down
with
a
bang
so
heavily
that
bruce
was
nearly
shot
up
into
the
air
amiable
as
she
always
was
and
respectfully
devoted
as
bruce
was
to
her
he
found
that
being
on
the
river
has
a
mysterious
power
of
bringing
out
any
defects
of
temper
that
people
have
concealed
when
on
dry
ground
he
said
to
her
do
that
again
do
you
mind
as
politely
as
he
could
she
looked
up
surprised
beg
your
pardon
mr
ottley
do
that
again
do
what
what
did
i
do
i
asked
you
to
trim
the
boat
did
i
do
i
merely
sat
down
he
did
like
to
say
that
she
should
sit
down
with
a
bump
and
took
his
place
you
like
she
said
graciously
relieve
you
there
presently
do
you
mean
relieve
me
mean
i
row
i
sit
in
the
stern
row
you
forgotten
the
names
of
the
different
parts
of
a
boat
madame
frabelle
i
think
not
mr
ottley
it
a
good
while
since
i
was
on
the
river
but
it
not
the
sort
of
thing
one
forgets
and
i
supposed
to
have
rather
a
good
memory
sure
you
have
a
wonderful
memory
still
where
i
sitting
is
not
the
stern
there
was
a
somewhat
sulky
silence
they
admired
the
scenery
of
the
river
madame
frabelle
said
she
loved
the
distant
glimpses
of
the
grey
old
palace
of
the
tudors
and
asked
him
if
he
could
imagine
what
it
was
like
when
it
was
gay
all
day
with
the
clanking
of
steel
and
prancing
horses
and
things
i
love
hampton
court
she
said
looks
so
quiet
and
peaceful
i
think
i
should
like
to
live
there
think
of
the
evenings
in
that
wonderful
old
place
with
its
panelled
walls
and
the
echo
of
feet
that
are
no
longer
there
down
the
cold
stone
corridors
bruce
gave
a
slight
laugh
of
feet
that
are
no
longer
there
but
how
could
that
be
dear
me
how
poetical
you
are
madame
frabelle
mean
the
imaginary
echo
ah
yes
you
very
imaginative
are
you
madame
frabelle
well
i
do
know
whether
it
imagination
or
not
but
do
you
know
i
fancy
that
queer
feeling
of
mine
seems
to
be
coming
on
again
queer
feeling
told
you
about
it
and
you
were
very
sympathetic
the
other
night
before
dinner
a
kind
of
emptiness
in
the
feet
and
a
hollowness
in
the
head
the
feeling
almost
but
not
quite
of
faintness
nearly
two
perhaps
you
hungry
said
madame
frabelle
bruce
thought
this
was
not
fair
putting
all
the
hunger
on
to
him
as
if
she
had
never
felt
anything
so
prosaic
madame
frabelle
always
behaved
as
if
she
were
superior
to
the
weaknesses
of
hunger
or
sleep
and
denied
ever
suffering
from
either
may
be
i
had
no
breakfast
said
bruce
untruthfully
as
though
it
were
necessary
to
apologise
for
requiring
food
to
sustain
life
did
i
said
madame
frabelle
hastily
do
you
feel
that
you
would
like
a
little
lunch
no
oh
dear
no
still
i
dare
say
some
food
would
do
you
good
mr
ottley
keep
you
up
i
come
and
watch
you
you
must
have
something
too
i
oh
very
well
just
to
keep
you
company
they
got
out
very
briskly
and
leaving
their
coffin
called
ironically
the
of
the
they
walked
with
quick
steps
to
the
nearest
hotel
here
they
found
a
selection
of
large
cold
beef
damp
ham
bread
cheese
celery
and
dessert
in
the
form
of
dry
apples
oranges
and
brazil
nuts
that
had
long
left
their
native
land
bruce
decided
that
the
right
thing
to
drink
was
but
to
keep
up
her
continental
reputation
madame
frabelle
said
she
would
like
a
little
light
wine
of
the
country
white
or
blue
asked
bruce
whose
spirits
were
rising
she
laughed
very
heartily
and
decided
on
a
little
red
they
had
an
adequate
if
not
exquisite
lunch
then
madame
frabelle
said
she
would
like
to
go
over
hampton
court
a
tedious
guide
offered
to
go
with
them
but
madame
frabelle
said
she
knew
all
about
the
place
better
than
he
did
so
they
wandered
through
the
beautiful
old
palace
to
think
of
king
charles
ii
beauties
living
there
those
lovely
languid
ladies
how
charming
they
were
exclaimed
madame
frabelle
wore
very
low
dresses
said
bruce
who
felt
rather
sleepy
and
stupid
and
as
if
he
did
quite
know
what
he
was
saying
madame
frabelle
modestly
looked
away
from
the
pictures
exquisite
the
garden
is
he
agreed
and
they
went
out
and
sat
somewhat
awkwardly
on
an
uncomfortable
stone
seat
there
was
a
delicious
of
real
summer
sun
of
those
april
days
that
seem
a
forecast
of
june
as
madame
frabelle
said
much
better
it
is
to
be
here
in
the
beautiful
fresh
air
than
squeezed
into
a
stuffy
theatre
remarked
bruce
who
was
really
feeling
a
shade
jealous
of
edith
for
seeing
the
revue
that
he
had
wished
to
see
indeed
there
nothing
like
england
i
think
she
said
rather
irrelevantly
exactly
our
tastes
agree
they
her
hand
was
on
the
edge
of
the
seat
somehow
or
other
bruce
had
gone
over
it
she
did
appear
to
notice
it
small
hands
you
have
he
remarked
no
i
take
sixes
said
the
lady
whose
size
was
really
more
than
that
he
insisted
on
looking
at
the
grey
suède
glove
and
then
examined
her
rings
suppose
these
rings
have
er
associations
for
you
madame
frabelle
she
said
shaking
her
head
one
yes
this
one
the
sapphire
recalls
old
memories
she
sighed
she
had
bought
it
in
the
brompton
road
present
from
your
husband
i
suppose
said
bruce
with
a
tinge
of
bitterness
she
answered
she
thought
he
was
getting
a
little
sentimental
too
early
in
the
day
and
with
an
effort
at
energy
she
said
go
back
to
the
river
they
went
back
and
now
bruce
began
to
show
off
his
rowing
powers
he
had
not
practised
for
a
long
time
and
did
get
along
very
quickly
she
admired
his
athletic
talents
as
though
he
had
been
a
winner
of
the
diamond
sculls
i
stuck
to
it
you
know
he
said
rather
apologetically
have
done
well
in
the
rowing
line
at
one
time
a
good
while
ago
i
thought
of
going
in
for
henley
in
the
regatta
you
know
but
with
that
beastly
foreign
office
one
ca
keep
up
anything
of
that
sort
suppose
not
muscle
said
bruce
sticking
out
his
arm
and
hitting
it
rather
hard
fairly
good
you
know
not
bad
for
a
london
man
who
never
has
any
practice
indeed
arm
was
about
seventeen
inches
round
just
below
the
elbow
at
one
time
bruce
said
few
years
ago
fancy
splendid
said
madame
frabelle
who
remembered
that
her
waist
was
not
much
more
a
good
while
ago
he
told
her
a
good
many
anecdotes
of
his
prowess
in
the
past
until
madame
frabelle
depended
greatly
on
tea
anything
else
she
could
do
without
but
a
cup
of
tea
in
the
afternoon
was
necessary
to
her
and
her
animation
she
became
rather
drowsy
and
absent
by
four
bruce
again
suggested
their
landing
and
leaving
the
of
the
as
they
had
not
thought
of
bringing
a
after
tea
which
was
a
great
success
they
became
very
cheery
and
jolly
they
went
for
a
walk
and
then
back
to
their
boat
this
was
the
happiest
time
of
the
day
when
they
reached
the
station
about
six
they
found
a
disagreeable
crowd
pushing
screaming
and
singing
martial
songs
as
they
got
into
their
carriage
about
a
dozen
passengers
sprang
in
just
as
the
train
started
bruce
was
furious
but
nothing
could
be
done
and
the
journey
back
to
town
was
taken
with
madame
frabelle
very
nearly
pushed
on
to
his
knee
by
a
rude
young
man
who
practically
sat
on
hers
smoking
a
bad
cigarette
in
her
face
they
tacitly
agreed
to
say
nothing
about
this
and
got
home
in
time
for
dinner
declaring
the
day
to
have
been
a
great
success
bruce
had
really
enjoyed
it
madame
frabelle
said
she
had
though
she
had
a
certain
little
tenderness
half
of
a
motherly
kind
for
bruce
she
far
preferred
his
society
in
a
comfortable
house
she
did
really
think
he
was
the
ideal
companion
for
the
open
air
and
he
was
struck
as
he
had
often
been
before
by
her
curious
way
of
contradicting
herself
in
conversation
she
took
any
side
and
argued
in
favour
of
it
so
long
as
it
was
striking
or
romantic
at
one
moment
she
would
say
with
the
greatest
earnestness
for
instance
that
divorce
should
not
be
allowed
marriage
should
be
for
ever
or
not
at
all
at
another
moment
she
would
argue
in
favour
of
that
absurd
contradiction
in
terms
known
as
free
love
that
she
had
completely
changed
round
since
earlier
in
the
conversation
this
was
irritating
but
he
was
still
impressed
with
her
infallibility
and
edith
remarked
more
every
day
how
curious
that
infallibility
was
and
how
safe
it
was
to
trust
whenever
madame
frabelle
knew
that
something
was
going
to
happen
it
did
and
whenever
she
had
an
intuition
that
something
was
going
to
occur
it
was
pretty
safe
it
never
would
in
the
same
way
she
had
only
to
look
at
a
person
to
see
them
as
they
were
not
this
was
so
invariable
it
was
really
very
convenient
to
have
her
in
the
house
for
whatever
she
said
was
always
wrong
one
had
to
go
by
contraries
and
her
prophecies
were
most
useful
been
jolly
for
you
bruce
said
to
edith
a
ripping
time
in
town
while
i
taking
your
visitors
about
to
show
them
england
would
have
cared
for
the
theatre
she
said
fancy
i
met
aylmer
son
there
aylmer
ross
you
know
aylmer
himself
is
at
the
front
they
have
taken
their
old
house
again
he
means
to
come
back
there
i
really
ca
help
it
said
bruce
rather
fretfully
should
be
at
the
front
if
it
were
for
my
neurotic
heart
the
doctor
hear
of
passing
me
at
least
one
would
any
fellow
who
would
have
done
so
would
be
not
a
careful
man
however
i
do
know
that
it
would
have
been
just
as
good
to
die
for
my
country
and
get
some
glory
as
to
die
of
heart
trouble
here
he
sighed
no
you
wo
said
edith
reassuringly
look
the
picture
of
health
got
a
bit
of
sunburn
i
think
said
bruce
popping
up
to
look
in
the
glass
how
i
do
catch
the
sun
i
asked
dr
pollock
about
it
one
day
did
you
consult
him
about
your
sunburn
what
are
you
smiling
at
he
said
it
caused
by
the
extreme
delicacy
of
the
mucous
membrane
nothing
to
be
anxious
about
do
think
i
am
anxious
not
particularly
and
do
worry
my
dear
boy
it
very
becoming
said
edith
bruce
patted
her
head
and
gave
her
a
kiss
smiling
chapter
viii
lunching
with
the
mitchells
today
said
edith
yes
i
remember
i
looking
forward
to
it
graciously
said
madame
frabelle
a
pity
your
husband
ca
come
is
it
ah
you
naughty
girl
i
do
believe
you
think
so
madame
frabelle
archly
shook
her
finger
at
edith
have
you
really
seriously
talked
yourself
into
thinking
that
mr
mitchell
is
anything
to
me
do
say
dear
said
madame
frabelle
sitting
down
comfortably
and
bringing
out
her
knitting
you
yourself
are
aware
of
it
i
say
that
you
in
love
with
him
but
that
he
is
devoted
to
you
anyone
with
can
see
and
some
day
she
shook
her
head
day
your
interest
in
him
may
take
you
by
surprise
is
interest
in
him
that
surprises
me
said
edith
a
good
friend
and
we
like
him
very
much
but
for
anything
else
so
it
really
rather
wonderful
mused
eglantine
never
had
a
thought
even
the
merest
dream
beyond
your
husband
that
it
has
never
even
occurred
to
you
that
anyone
else
might
have
suited
your
temperament
better
edith
dropped
her
book
and
picked
it
up
again
her
friend
thought
she
saw
whether
through
stooping
or
what
not
an
increase
of
colour
in
her
face
is
everyone
continued
madame
frabelle
would
appreciate
your
husband
as
you
do
to
me
he
is
a
very
charming
man
i
can
understand
his
inspiring
a
feeling
almost
of
motherly
interest
i
even
feel
sometimes
she
laughed
if
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
look
after
him
take
care
of
him
i
think
it
would
not
have
been
a
bad
thing
for
him
to
have
married
a
woman
a
little
older
than
himself
but
you
edith
you
so
young
you
see
you
might
have
made
a
mistake
when
you
married
him
you
were
a
mere
girl
and
i
could
imagine
some
of
his
ways
might
irritate
a
very
young
woman
after
a
moment
she
went
on
suppose
bruce
was
very
handsome
when
you
married
him
he
was
but
he
has
altered
much
as
i
told
you
before
edith
though
i
think
you
an
ideal
wife
you
do
give
me
the
impression
of
being
in
love
with
him
i
hope
you
take
this
as
an
impertinence
my
dear
at
all
and
i
not
sure
that
i
am
your
told
me
the
other
day
that
you
had
been
such
a
marvellous
wife
to
him
that
you
had
even
made
sacrifices
you
have
never
had
anything
to
forgive
surely
no
never
hastily
said
edith
fearing
that
mrs
ottley
was
a
little
inclined
to
be
indiscreet
told
me
that
bruce
had
been
occasionally
attracted
only
very
slightly
by
other
women
but
that
you
were
the
only
person
he
really
cared
for
i
doubt
if
he
ever
thinks
much
of
anyone
else
said
edith
a
characteristic
of
the
mitchells
entertainments
was
that
one
always
met
there
the
people
they
had
met
even
for
the
first
time
at
one
own
house
here
were
the
conistons
and
landi
whom
edith
was
always
delighted
to
see
it
was
a
large
and
gay
lunch
edith
was
placed
some
distance
from
mr
mitchell
of
course
there
was
also
a
novelty
some
lion
or
other
was
always
at
the
mitchells
today
it
consisted
of
a
certain
clergyman
called
the
rev
byrne
fraser
of
whom
mrs
mitchell
and
her
circle
were
making
much
he
was
a
handsome
man
of
whom
more
was
supposed
than
could
conveniently
be
said
his
wife
who
adored
him
admitted
that
though
he
was
an
excellent
husband
he
suffered
from
rheumatism
and
religious
doubts
which
made
him
occasionally
rather
trying
there
had
been
some
story
about
him
nobody
knew
what
it
was
madame
frabelle
instantly
took
his
side
and
said
she
was
sure
he
had
been
though
she
knew
nothing
whatever
about
it
she
was
placed
next
to
him
at
table
and
began
immediately
on
what
she
thought
was
his
special
subject
understand
that
you
very
modern
in
your
views
she
said
smiling
he
exclaimed
in
some
surprise
you
are
quite
mistaken
i
do
think
i
am
at
all
oh
i
so
glad
i
such
a
worship
myself
for
tradition
so
thankful
that
you
have
too
do
know
that
i
have
he
said
true
then
what
i
heard
i
felt
it
was
the
moment
i
looked
at
you
mr
fraser
i
mean
that
you
an
atheist
he
exclaimed
turning
pale
with
horror
heavens
madame
do
you
know
what
my
profession
is
he
seemed
utterly
puzzled
by
her
she
managed
all
the
same
somehow
or
other
to
lure
him
into
a
conversation
in
which
she
took
his
side
by
the
end
of
lunch
they
were
getting
on
splendidly
though
neither
of
them
knew
what
they
were
talking
about
and
this
was
one
of
the
curious
characteristics
of
madame
frabelle
nobody
made
so
many
gaffes
yet
got
out
of
them
so
well
to
use
the
lawyer
phrase
she
used
so
many
words
that
she
managed
to
engulf
her
own
and
her
interlocutor
ideas
perhaps
had
ever
talked
so
much
nonsense
seriously
as
she
did
that
day
but
the
rev
byrne
fraser
said
she
was
a
remarkable
woman
who
had
read
and
thought
deeply
also
he
was
enchanted
with
her
interest
in
him
as
everybody
always
was
edith
thought
she
had
heard
mr
mitchell
saying
something
to
the
others
that
interested
her
she
managed
to
get
near
him
when
the
gentlemen
joined
them
in
the
studio
as
they
called
the
large
room
where
there
was
a
stage
a
piano
a
parquet
floor
and
every
possible
arrangement
for
amusement
madame
frabelle
moved
quickly
away
supposing
that
edith
wished
to
speak
to
him
for
his
sake
whereas
really
it
was
in
order
to
have
repeated
something
she
thought
she
had
heard
at
lunch
i
hear
you
saying
anything
about
your
old
friend
aylmer
ross
she
asked
indeed
have
you
heard
the
poor
fellow
has
been
wounded
he
was
taken
into
hospital
at
once
fortunately
and
he
getting
better
and
is
going
to
be
brought
home
almost
immediately
to
the
same
old
house
in
jermyn
street
i
think
his
son
is
to
meet
him
at
the
station
today
we
must
all
go
and
see
him
capital
chap
aylmer
i
always
liked
him
he
travelled
so
much
that
even
before
the
war
i
had
seen
him
for
three
years
the
wound
serious
asked
edith
who
had
turned
pale
were
anxious
at
first
now
he
out
of
danger
but
poor
chap
afraid
he
wo
be
able
to
move
for
a
good
while
his
leg
is
broken
i
hear
he
got
to
be
kept
lying
down
two
or
three
months
ce
y
a
edith
asked
landi
who
joined
her
just
heard
some
bad
news
she
said
do
speak
about
it
she
told
him
du
calme
mon
enfant
du
calme
i
anxious
landi
se
voit
you
think
ne
sera
rien
it
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
to
him
he
be
all
right
i
suppose
you
want
to
see
him
edith
may
not
wish
to
see
me
said
edith
yes
he
will
you
were
the
first
person
he
thought
of
answered
landi
my
dear
you
forget
you
treated
him
badly
if
he
treated
badly
he
would
care
to
see
me
again
you
mean
probable
said
landi
selecting
with
care
a
very
large
cigar
from
a
box
that
was
being
handed
round
be
quite
tranquil
i
shall
go
and
see
him
directly
i
leave
here
and
i
let
you
hear
every
detail
will
that
do
dear
landi
but
even
if
he
wishes
to
see
me
ought
i
to
go
i
do
know
but
you
will
he
lighted
the
long
cigar
chapter
ix
next
morning
edith
who
always
came
down
to
breakfast
though
somewhat
late
found
on
her
plate
a
letter
from
lady
conroy
that
most
vague
and
forgetful
of
all
charming
irishwomen
it
said
dear
mrs
ottley
do
excuse
my
troubling
you
but
could
you
give
me
a
little
information
someone
has
asked
me
about
madame
frabelle
i
know
that
she
is
a
friend
of
yours
and
is
staying
with
you
and
i
said
so
also
i
have
a
sort
of
idea
that
she
was
in
some
way
connected
with
you
by
marriage
or
relationship
but
of
that
i
was
not
quite
sure
i
fancy
that
it
is
due
to
you
that
i
have
the
pleasure
of
knowing
her
anyhow
you
tell
me
who
she
was
before
she
married
what
her
husband
was
and
anything
else
about
her
that
she
is
most
charming
and
a
very
clever
woman
i
know
of
course
already
to
say
she
is
a
friend
of
yours
is
enough
to
say
that
but
the
rest
i
forget
you
will
forgive
my
troubling
you
and
that
you
are
all
very
well
i
remain
yours
most
sincerely
conroy
i
began
to
take
some
lessons
in
nursing
when
i
came
across
a
most
charming
and
delightful
girl
called
dulcie
clay
do
you
happen
to
know
her
at
all
her
father
married
again
and
she
was
not
happy
at
home
and
having
no
money
she
went
in
for
nursing
seriously
not
as
i
did
but
i
afraid
she
is
not
strong
enough
for
the
profession
remember
me
to
madame
frabelle
edith
passed
the
letter
to
bruce
this
too
delightful
she
said
exactly
like
her
she
sends
madame
frabelle
to
me
with
a
letter
of
introduction
and
then
asks
me
who
she
is
said
bruce
who
saw
nothing
of
the
absurdity
of
the
situation
conroy
is
a
most
charming
person
it
looks
almost
as
if
she
wanted
to
decline
responsibility
i
would
annoy
her
for
the
world
you
must
give
her
all
the
information
she
wants
of
course
all
i
know
i
only
know
from
her
well
tell
her
what
she
told
you
madame
frabelle
told
us
candidly
she
made
her
acquaintance
at
the
hotel
but
it
absurd
to
tell
lady
conroy
that
back
we
ca
edith
found
the
original
letter
of
introduction
after
some
searching
and
wrote
to
lady
conroy
to
say
that
she
understood
madame
frabelle
who
was
no
connection
of
hers
was
a
clever
interesting
woman
who
wished
to
study
english
life
in
her
native
land
she
was
good
family
she
had
been
a
miss
eglantine
pollard
and
was
the
widow
of
a
french
wine
this
was
word
for
word
what
lady
conroy
had
told
her
she
went
on
to
say
that
she
madame
frabelle
had
several
friends
and
connections
in
mitchells
for
instance
suggested
bruce
that
a
good
idea
knows
the
mitchells
very
edith
went
on
writing
think
you
know
them
also
they
are
very
great
friends
of
ours
mr
mitchell
is
in
the
foreign
the
conistons
suggested
bruce
knows
the
conistons
the
nice
young
brother
and
sister
we
are
so
fond
of
she
has
other
friends
in
london
i
believe
but
she
has
not
troubled
to
look
them
up
the
more
one
sees
of
her
the
more
one
likes
her
she
is
most
charming
and
amiable
and
makes
friends
wherever
she
goes
i
do
think
i
know
anything
more
than
this
dear
lady
conroy
yours
very
sincerely
edith
ottley
i
have
not
met
miss
dulcie
bruce
was
satisfied
with
this
letter
edith
herself
thought
it
the
most
amusing
letter
she
had
ever
written
clergyman
whom
she
met
at
lunch
yesterday
by
the
way
said
bruce
it
sound
well
to
mention
him
edith
laughed
and
added
to
the
letter
rev
byrne
fraser
knows
our
friend
also
and
seems
to
like
only
thing
is
said
bruce
after
a
moment
pause
that
might
do
her
harm
with
lady
conroy
although
he
a
clergyman
there
have
been
some
funny
stories
about
the
rev
byrne
fraser
certainly
liked
her
said
edith
wrote
her
a
long
letter
last
night
after
meeting
her
at
lunch
to
go
on
with
their
argument
or
conversation
or
whatever
it
was
and
she
going
to
hear
him
preach
on
sunday
you
feel
she
would
wish
lady
conroy
to
know
that
she
a
friend
of
the
rev
byrne
fraser
asked
bruce
i
think
so
or
i
would
have
said
it
edith
was
really
growing
more
and
more
loyal
in
her
friendship
there
certainly
was
something
about
madame
frabelle
that
everybody
clever
and
stupid
alike
seemed
to
be
attracted
by
later
edith
received
a
telephone
call
from
landi
he
told
her
that
he
had
seen
aylmer
who
was
going
on
well
that
he
had
begged
to
see
her
and
had
been
allowed
by
his
doctor
and
nurse
to
receive
a
visit
from
her
on
saturday
next
he
said
that
aylmer
had
been
agitated
because
his
boy
was
going
almost
immediately
to
the
front
he
seemed
very
pleased
at
the
idea
of
seeing
her
again
edith
looked
forward
with
a
certain
excitement
to
saturday
a
day
or
two
later
edith
received
a
letter
from
lady
conroy
saying
dear
edith
thank
you
so
much
for
your
nice
letter
i
remember
now
of
course
madame
frabelle
was
a
friend
of
the
mitchells
whom
i
know
so
well
and
like
so
much
what
dears
they
are
please
remember
me
to
them
i
knew
that
she
had
a
friend
who
was
a
clergyman
but
i
was
quite
sure
who
it
was
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
this
mr
fraser
she
was
a
miss
pollard
you
know
a
very
good
family
and
as
i
always
understood
the
more
one
knows
of
her
the
better
one
likes
her
again
for
your
note
i
am
longing
to
see
you
and
shall
call
directly
i
come
to
london
ever
yours
conroy
madame
f
husband
was
a
french
wine
merchant
and
a
very
charming
man
i
believe
by
the
way
also
she
knows
the
conistons
i
believe
and
no
doubt
several
people
we
both
know
miss
clay
has
gone
to
london
with
one
of
her
patients
bruce
did
understand
why
edith
was
so
much
amused
by
this
letter
nor
why
she
said
that
she
should
soon
write
and
ask
lady
conroy
who
madame
frabelle
was
and
that
she
would
probably
answer
that
she
was
a
great
friend
of
edith
and
of
the
mitchells
and
the
rev
byrne
fraser
seems
a
little
doubtful
about
fraser
does
she
bruce
said
mean
lady
conroy
certainly
she
got
rather
a
funny
memory
she
does
seem
to
have
the
slightest
idea
that
she
sent
her
to
you
with
a
letter
of
introduction
now
we
taken
all
the
responsibility
on
ourselves
really
i
do
mind
said
edith
does
it
matter
obviously
no
harm
in
madame
frabelle
and
never
could
have
been
a
very
clever
woman
said
bruce
always
interested
when
i
hear
what
she
has
to
say
about
people
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
nearly
always
guided
by
it
am
i
said
edith
indeed
edith
did
sincerely
regard
her
opinion
as
very
valuable
she
found
her
so
invariably
wrong
that
she
was
quite
a
useful
guide
she
was
never
quite
sure
of
her
own
judgement
until
madame
frabelle
had
contradicted
it
when
edith
went
to
call
on
aylmer
in
the
little
brown
house
in
jermyn
street
she
was
shown
first
into
the
in
a
few
minutes
a
young
girl
dressed
as
a
nurse
came
in
to
speak
to
her
she
seemed
very
shy
and
spoke
in
a
soft
voice
miss
clay
she
said
been
nursing
for
the
last
six
months
but
i
not
very
strong
and
was
afraid
i
would
have
to
give
it
up
when
i
met
mr
ross
at
boulogne
he
was
getting
on
so
well
that
i
came
back
to
look
after
him
and
i
shall
stay
until
he
is
quite
well
i
think
evidently
this
was
the
dulcie
clay
lady
conroy
had
mentioned
edith
was
much
struck
by
her
she
was
a
really
beautiful
girl
with
but
one
slight
defect
which
some
people
perhaps
would
have
rather
admired
her
skin
was
rather
too
dark
and
a
curious
contrast
to
her
beautiful
blue
eyes
as
a
rule
the
combination
of
blue
eyes
and
dark
hair
goes
with
a
fair
complexion
dulcie
clay
had
a
brown
skin
clear
and
pale
such
as
usually
goes
with
the
spanish
type
of
brunette
but
for
this
curious
darkness
which
showed
up
her
dazzling
white
teeth
she
was
quite
lovely
it
was
a
sweet
sensitive
face
and
her
blue
eyes
with
long
eyelashes
like
little
feathers
were
charming
in
their
soft
expression
her
smile
was
very
sweet
though
she
had
a
look
of
melancholy
there
was
something
touching
about
her
she
was
below
the
usual
height
slight
and
graceful
her
hair
parted
in
the
middle
was
arranged
in
the
madonna
style
in
two
thick
natural
waves
each
side
of
her
face
she
had
none
of
the
bustling
of
the
lady
nurse
but
was
very
gentle
and
diffident
surely
aylmer
must
be
in
love
with
her
thought
edith
then
miss
clay
said
in
her
low
voice
are
mrs
ottley
are
you
i
knew
you
at
once
you
how
was
that
a
little
colour
came
into
the
pale
dark
face
ross
has
a
little
photograph
of
you
she
said
once
when
he
was
very
ill
he
gave
me
your
name
and
address
and
asked
me
to
send
it
to
you
if
anything
happened
as
she
said
that
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
but
he
be
all
right
now
wo
he
asked
edith
with
a
feeling
of
sympathy
for
miss
clay
and
a
desire
to
cheer
the
girl
i
think
he
be
all
right
now
she
said
come
up
chapter
x
it
was
a
curious
thing
about
madame
frabelle
that
though
she
was
perfectly
at
ease
in
any
society
and
really
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
the
world
all
her
notions
of
life
were
taken
from
the
stage
she
looked
upon
existence
from
the
theatrical
point
of
view
everyone
was
to
her
a
hero
or
a
heroine
a
villain
or
a
victim
to
her
a
death
was
a
a
marriage
a
happy
ending
had
she
known
the
exact
circumstances
in
which
edith
went
to
see
the
wounded
hero
madame
frabelle
dramatic
remarks
the
obvious
observations
which
she
would
have
showered
on
her
friend
would
have
been
quite
unendurable
therefore
edith
chose
to
say
merely
that
she
was
going
to
see
an
old
friend
so
as
not
to
excite
her
friend
irritable
imagination
by
any
hint
of
sentiment
or
romance
on
the
subject
during
her
absence
in
the
afternoon
it
happened
that
mrs
mitchell
had
called
with
a
lady
whom
she
had
known
intimately
since
tuesday
so
she
was
quite
an
old
friend
madame
frabelle
had
received
them
together
in
edith
place
on
her
return
madame
frabelle
was
full
of
the
stranger
she
had
it
seemed
been
dressed
in
bright
violet
and
did
nothing
but
laugh
whether
it
was
that
everything
amused
her
or
merely
that
laughter
was
the
only
mode
she
knew
of
expressing
all
her
sentiments
impressions
and
feelings
madame
frabelle
was
not
quite
sure
her
name
was
miss
radford
and
she
was
she
had
very
red
cheeks
and
curly
black
hair
she
had
screamed
with
laughter
from
disappointment
at
hearing
mrs
ottley
was
out
and
shrieked
at
hearing
that
madame
frabelle
had
been
deputed
to
receive
them
in
her
place
mrs
mitchell
had
whispered
that
she
was
a
most
interesting
person
and
madame
frabelle
thought
she
certainly
was
it
appeared
that
mrs
mitchell
had
sent
the
motor
somewhere
during
their
visit
and
by
some
mistake
it
was
a
long
time
coming
back
this
had
caused
peals
of
laughter
from
miss
radford
and
just
as
they
had
made
up
their
minds
to
walk
home
the
motor
arrived
so
she
went
away
with
mrs
mitchell
giggling
so
much
she
could
hardly
stand
miss
radford
also
had
been
highly
amused
by
the
charming
way
the
boudoir
was
furnished
and
had
laughed
most
heartily
at
the
curtains
and
the
pictures
edith
was
sorry
to
have
missed
her
she
was
evidently
a
valuable
discovery
one
of
their
new
treasures
a
rare
of
the
mitchells
madame
frabelle
then
told
edith
and
bruce
that
she
had
promised
to
dine
with
the
mitchells
one
day
next
week
edith
was
pleased
to
find
that
eglantine
and
also
bruce
who
had
by
now
returned
home
were
so
full
of
mrs
mitchell
visit
and
invitation
that
neither
of
them
asked
her
a
single
question
about
aylmer
and
appeared
to
have
completely
forgotten
all
about
him
as
madame
frabelle
left
them
for
a
moment
edith
observed
a
cloud
of
gloom
over
bruce
expressive
countenance
he
said
really
upon
my
word
this
is
a
bit
too
much
mind
you
i
not
at
all
surprised
in
fact
i
always
expected
it
but
it
is
a
bit
of
a
shock
is
it
when
you
find
old
friends
throwing
you
over
like
this
he
walked
up
and
down
much
agitated
repeating
the
same
thing
in
different
words
that
he
had
never
been
so
surprised
in
his
life
that
it
was
what
he
had
always
known
would
happen
that
it
was
a
great
shock
and
he
had
always
expected
it
at
last
edith
said
do
see
anything
so
strange
about
it
bruce
it
natural
enough
they
should
have
asked
her
is
it
how
would
they
ever
have
known
her
but
for
us
could
they
ask
her
without
knowing
her
besides
we
went
there
last
we
lunched
with
them
only
the
other
day
not
the
point
you
have
missed
the
point
entirely
unfortunately
you
generally
do
you
have
in
the
most
marked
way
a
woman
weakness
edith
you
incapable
of
arguing
logically
i
consider
it
a
downright
slight
no
not
so
much
a
slight
as
an
insult
perhaps
injury
is
the
to
take
away
our
guest
and
not
ask
us
not
that
i
should
have
gone
i
should
have
dreamed
of
going
in
any
case
for
one
thing
we
were
there
last
we
lunched
there
only
the
other
day
besides
we
engaged
to
dine
with
my
mother
mitchell
knew
that
that
why
she
asked
madame
frabelle
because
she
would
be
alone
how
like
you
edith
always
miss
the
point
always
stick
up
for
everyone
but
me
you
invariably
take
the
other
side
however
perhaps
it
is
all
for
the
best
it
just
as
well
nothing
would
have
induced
me
to
have
gone
even
if
i
had
been
engaged
i
mean
i
getting
a
bit
tired
of
the
mitchells
sick
of
them
their
tone
is
frivolous
and
if
they
pressed
me
ever
so
much
nothing
in
the
world
would
have
made
me
break
my
promise
to
my
mother
then
it
all
right
why
complain
bruce
continued
however
in
deep
depression
till
they
received
a
message
from
the
mitchells
asking
edith
if
she
and
her
husband
manage
to
come
all
the
same
if
they
were
not
afraid
of
offending
the
elder
mrs
ottley
they
could
go
to
bruce
mother
at
any
time
and
the
mitchells
particularly
wanted
them
to
meet
some
people
tomorrow
night
a
small
party
unexpectedly
got
up
course
you
wo
go
said
edith
to
bruce
from
the
telephone
said
you
would
under
any
circumstances
i
refuse
shall
i
no
do
certainly
not
of
course
i
shall
go
accept
immediately
they
quite
right
it
is
perfectly
true
we
can
go
to
my
mother
any
other
day
besides
i
do
think
it
quite
fair
to
old
friends
like
the
mitchells
to
throw
them
over
when
they
particularly
want
us
and
ask
us
as
a
special
favour
to
them
like
this
do
think
perhaps
that
somebody
else
has
disappointed
them
and
they
asked
us
at
the
last
minute
to
fill
up
suggested
edith
to
whom
this
was
perfectly
obvious
bruce
was
furious
at
this
suggestion
not
he
exclaimed
idea
of
such
a
thing
as
if
they
would
treat
me
like
that
decidedly
we
will
go
right
she
said
as
you
wish
but
your
mother
will
be
disappointed
bruce
insisted
of
course
the
invitation
was
accepted
and
once
again
he
was
happy
and
at
last
edith
was
able
to
be
alone
and
to
think
over
her
meeting
with
aylmer
a
dramatic
meeting
under
romantic
circumstances
between
two
people
of
the
race
always
appears
to
fall
a
little
flat
words
are
difficult
to
find
when
she
went
in
to
find
him
looking
thin
and
weak
pale
under
his
sunburn
changed
and
worn
she
was
deeply
thrilled
and
touched
it
brought
close
to
her
the
simple
heroic
manner
in
which
so
many
men
are
calmly
risking
their
lives
taking
it
as
a
matter
of
course
and
as
she
knew
for
a
fact
that
he
was
and
had
gone
into
the
new
army
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
war
she
was
aware
he
must
have
strained
a
point
in
order
to
join
she
admired
him
for
it
he
greeted
her
with
that
bright
expression
in
his
eyes
and
with
the
smile
that
she
had
always
liked
so
much
which
lighted
up
like
a
ray
of
sunshine
the
lean
brown
somewhat
hard
face
she
sat
down
by
his
side
and
all
she
could
think
of
to
say
was
aylmer
he
answered
edith
here
you
are
he
took
her
hand
and
she
left
it
in
his
then
they
sat
in
silence
occasionally
broken
by
an
obvious
remark
when
he
had
left
three
years
ago
both
had
parted
in
love
and
aylmer
in
anger
he
had
meant
never
to
see
her
again
never
to
forgive
her
for
her
refusal
to
use
bruce
escapade
as
a
means
of
freeing
herself
to
marry
him
yet
now
when
they
met
they
spoke
the
merest
commonplaces
and
afterwards
neither
of
them
could
ever
remember
what
had
passed
between
them
during
the
visit
she
knew
it
was
short
and
that
it
had
left
an
impression
that
calmed
her
somehow
she
had
thought
of
him
so
much
that
when
she
actually
saw
him
again
her
affection
seemed
cooler
had
she
worn
out
the
passion
by
dint
of
constancy
that
must
be
strange
unaccountably
touched
as
she
was
at
his
wishing
to
see
her
just
after
he
had
nearly
died
the
feeling
now
seemed
to
be
more
like
a
warm
friendship
and
less
like
love
the
little
nurse
had
seen
her
out
edith
saw
that
she
had
been
crying
evidently
she
was
quite
devoted
to
aylmer
and
poor
girl
she
probably
regarded
edith
as
a
rival
but
edith
would
not
be
one
of
that
she
was
determined
she
wondered
whether
their
meeting
had
had
the
same
effect
on
aylmer
she
thought
he
had
shown
more
emotion
than
she
had
will
be
better
now
dulcie
clay
had
said
to
her
at
the
door
come
again
mrs
ottley
edith
thought
that
generous
it
seemed
to
her
that
dulcie
was
as
frank
and
open
as
a
child
edith
at
any
rate
could
read
her
like
a
book
it
made
her
feel
sorry
for
the
girl
as
edith
analysed
her
own
feelings
she
wondered
why
she
had
felt
no
jealousy
of
her
only
gratitude
for
her
goodness
to
aylmer
all
her
sensations
were
confused
only
one
resolution
was
firm
in
her
mind
whether
he
wished
it
or
not
they
should
never
be
on
the
terms
they
were
before
it
could
only
lead
to
the
same
ending
to
unhappiness
no
after
all
these
years
of
separation
edith
would
be
his
friend
and
only
his
friend
of
that
she
was
resolved

said
bruce
thoughtfully
at
breakfast
next
day
a
very
strict
roman
catholic
bruce
was
addicted
to
volunteering
information
and
making
unanswerable
remarks
madame
frabelle
said
to
edith
in
a
low
earnest
tone
me
the
butter
dear
and
looked
attentively
at
bruce
sometimes
think
i
should
mind
being
one
myself
bruce
continued
should
rather
like
to
eat
fish
on
fridays
you
like
eating
fish
on
thursdays
said
edith
mr
ottley
never
seems
to
care
very
much
for
meat
it
particularly
well
cooked
in
a
particular
way
said
edith
said
madame
frabelle
rather
pompously
meant
for
people
who
like
feasts
true
he
gave
her
an
admiring
glance
should
not
mind
confessing
either
continued
bruce
think
i
should
rather
like
it
he
thought
he
was
having
a
religious
discussion
you
always
do
confess
said
edith
to
priests
perhaps
but
to
friends
to
acquaintances
at
clubs
to
girls
you
take
in
to
dinner
you
do
call
it
confessing
you
call
it
telling
them
a
curious
thing
that
you
happen
to
remember
calls
it
conversing
said
madame
frabelle
she
then
gave
a
slight
flippant
giggle
afterwards
correcting
it
by
a
thoughtful
sigh

bruce
said
understood
he
was
anglican
by
the
way
was
aylmer
ross
a
roman
catholic
think
he
is
bruce
having
mentioned
his
name
edith
now
told
him
the
news
about
her
visit
to
their
friend
bruce
liked
good
news
more
perhaps
because
it
was
news
than
because
it
was
good
yet
the
incident
seemed
to
put
him
in
a
rather
bad
temper
he
was
sorry
for
aylmer
illness
glad
he
was
better
proud
of
knowing
him
or
indeed
of
knowing
anyone
who
had
been
publicly
mentioned
and
jealous
of
the
admiration
visible
in
both
edith
and
madame
frabelle
this
medley
of
feeling
resulted
in
his
taking
up
a
book
and
saying
heavens
again
i
found
you
my
book
edith
only
turned
down
a
page
she
said
gently
you
have
you
it
it
frightfully
irritating
dear
how
you
take
no
notice
of
my
rebukes
or
my
comments
upon
my
word
what
i
say
to
you
seems
to
go
in
at
one
ear
and
out
at
the
other
just
like
water
on
a
duck
back
does
the
water
on
a
duck
back
get
into
the
dog
ears
i
mean
the
duck
ears
oh
i
sorry
i
wo
do
it
again
bruce
sighed
flattened
out
the
folded
page
and
left
the
room
with
quiet
dignity
but
caught
his
foot
in
the
mat
both
ladies
ignored
the
accident
when
he
had
gone
madame
frabelle
said
edith
is
only
a
little
tidy
said
edith
know
my
husband
was
dreadfully
untidy
which
is
much
worse
suppose
they
have
their
faults
men
are
all
alike
exclaimed
madame
frabelle
cynically
some
men
said
edith
to
a
woman
i
mean
a
nice
woman
there
is
no
such
thing
as
men
there
is
a
man
and
either
she
is
so
fond
of
him
that
she
can
talk
of
nothing
else
however
unfavourably
or
so
much
in
love
with
him
that
she
never
mentions
his
name
often
say
women
are
all
alike
said
madame
frabelle
a
man
says
that
he
means
there
is
only
one
woman
in
the
world
and
he
in
love
with
her
and
she
is
not
in
love
with
him
are
not
so
faithful
as
women
remarked
madame
frabelle
with
the
air
of
a
discovery
not
and
yet
well
i
think
the
difference
is
that
a
man
is
often
more
in
love
with
the
woman
he
is
unfaithful
to
than
with
the
woman
he
is
unfaithful
with
with
us
it
is
different
madame
frabelle
i
think
i
take
archie
with
me
today
to
see
aylmer
ross
tell
bruce
so
casually
and
will
you
come
with
me
another
day
the
greatest
pleasure
said
madame
frabelle
darkly
and
with
an
expressive
look
neither
she
nor
edith
had
any
idea
what
it
expressed
edith
found
aylmer
wonderfully
better
the
pretty
little
nurse
with
the
dark
face
and
pale
blue
eyes
told
her
he
had
had
a
peaceful
night
and
had
bucked
up
tremendously
he
was
seated
in
an
with
one
leg
on
another
chair
and
with
him
was
arthur
coniston
a
great
admirer
of
his
it
was
characteristic
of
aylmer
the
moment
he
was
able
to
see
as
many
friends
as
he
was
allowed
aylmer
was
a
very
gregarious
person
though
or
perhaps
because
he
detested
parties
he
liked
company
but
hated
society
arthur
coniston
who
always
did
his
best
to
attract
attention
by
his
modest
manner
was
sitting
with
his
handsome
young
head
quite
on
one
side
from
intense
respect
for
his
host
whom
he
regarded
with
the
greatest
admiration
as
a
man
of
culture
and
a
judge
of
art
he
rejoiced
to
be
one
of
the
first
to
see
him
just
returned
after
three
years
absence
from
england
and
having
spent
the
last
three
months
at
the
front
arthur
coniston
also
in
khaki
who
was
a
born
interviewer
was
anxious
to
know
aylmer
impression
of
certain
things
over
here
after
his
long
absence
should
so
very
much
like
to
know
he
said
your
view
is
of
the
attitude
to
life
of
the
aylmer
smiled
he
said
think
their
attitude
to
life
as
you
call
it
is
best
expressed
in
some
of
lear
nonsense
rhymes
aunt
jobiska
said
knows
that
a
pobble
is
better
without
his
archie
looked
up
in
smiling
recognition
of
these
lines
and
edith
laughed
me
but
i
do
quite
follow
you
said
young
coniston
gravely
do
you
see
of
course
lear
is
the
spirit
they
express
a
portrait
by
a
is
sure
to
be
a
dong
with
a
luminous
nose
and
do
you
remember
owl
and
the
pussycat
went
to
sea
in
a
beautiful
would
a
boat
painted
by
a
be
i
see
that
but
why
the
pobble
without
its
toes
the
sculptor
always
surrenders
colour
and
the
painted
form
each
has
to
give
up
something
for
the
limitation
of
art
but
the
more
modern
artist
gives
up
much
more
likeness
beauty
a
few
features
here
and
there
a
limb
now
and
then
yes
i
quite
see
what
you
mean
like
the
statuary
of
rodin
or
epstein
one
sees
really
only
half
the
form
as
if
growing
out
of
the
sketchy
sculpture
and
then
there
another
thing
i
hope
i
not
wearying
you
indeed
it
great
fun
such
a
change
to
hear
about
this
sort
of
thing
again
futurists
asked
arthur
is
your
view
of
them
of
course
they
are
already
past
they
always
were
but
i
should
say
their
attitude
to
life
is
that
of
the
man
who
is
looking
at
the
moon
reflected
in
a
lake
but
ca
see
it
he
sees
the
reflection
of
a
instead
yes
they
see
things
wrong
you
mean
they
not
so
real
not
so
logical
as
the
the
futurist
is
off
the
rails
entirely
and
he
seems
to
see
hardly
anything
but
railways
but
all
that
noisy
nonsense
of
the
futurists
always
bored
me
frightfully
aylmer
said
for
affectation
i
prefer
the
pose
of
depression
and
pessimism
to
that
of
bullying
and
high
spirits
when
the
affected
young
poet
pretended
to
be
used
up
and
worn
out
one
knew
there
was
vitality
under
it
all
but
when
i
see
a
cheerful
young
man
shrieking
about
how
full
of
life
he
is
banging
on
a
drum
and
blowing
on
a
tin
trumpet
and
speaking
of
his
good
spirits
it
depresses
me
since
naturally
it
gives
the
contrary
impression
it
be
real
it
ought
to
be
but
it
is
if
the
noisy
person
meant
what
he
said
he
would
say
it
see
the
modern
are
so
good
as
the
old
ones
odle
is
not
so
clever
as
beardsley
course
not
beardsley
had
the
gift
of
line
though
he
did
always
know
where
to
draw
it
but
his
illustrations
to
wilde
work
were
unsuitable
because
beardsley
wanted
everything
down
in
black
and
white
and
wilde
wanted
everything
in
purple
and
gold
but
both
had
their
restraints
and
their
pose
was
reserve
not
flamboyance
think
you
mean
that
if
people
are
so
sickening
as
to
have
an
affectation
at
all
you
would
rather
they
kept
it
quiet
said
edith
at
least
it
brings
a
smile
to
one
lips
to
see
a
very
young
man
pretend
he
is
bored
with
life
i
have
often
wondered
what
the
answer
would
be
from
one
of
these
chaps
and
what
he
would
actually
say
if
you
held
a
loaded
pistol
to
his
head
i
mean
the
man
who
says
he
think
life
worth
living
do
you
think
he
would
say
asked
coniston
would
scream
good
heavens
what
are
you
doing
put
that
down
said
edith
right
said
aylmer
always
is
dulcie
came
in
and
brought
tea
hope
we
not
tiring
him
edith
asked
her
no
i
think
it
does
him
good
he
enjoys
it
she
sat
down
with
archie
and
talked
to
him
gently
in
the
corner
living
so
much
among
real
things
coniston
was
saying
feels
half
ashamed
to
discuss
our
old
subjects
however
he
and
aylmer
continued
to
talk
over
books
and
pictures
coniston
hanging
on
his
lips
as
though
afraid
of
missing
or
forgetting
a
word
he
said
presently
edith
told
aylmer
about
their
new
friend
madame
frabelle
he
was
very
curious
to
see
her
is
she
like
he
asked
ca
imagine
her
living
with
you
is
she
a
skeleton
at
the
feast
skeleton
exclaimed
coniston
heavens
no
quite
the
contrary
skeleton
who
was
always
feasting
would
hardly
remain
one
long
suggested
edith
said
aylmer
cupboard
is
the
proper
place
for
a
skeleton
archie
had
joined
the
group
round
aylmer
edith
sat
in
a
corner
for
some
time
chatting
with
dulcie
they
arranged
that
bruce
was
to
call
the
next
day
and
edith
and
madame
frabelle
the
day
after
when
they
went
away
archie
who
had
listened
very
closely
to
the
conversation
said
a
lot
of
manners
mr
coniston
has
what
did
he
mean
by
saying
that
spanish
painters
painted
a
man
in
a
gramophone
edith
racked
her
brain
to
remember
the
sentence
then
she
said
with
a
laugh
yes
i
know
mr
coniston
said
the
spanish
artists
painted
to
a
man
in
monochrome
i
ca
explain
it
archie
it
does
matter
why
did
you
leave
miss
clay
and
come
back
to
us
i
like
her
all
right
but
you
get
tired
of
talking
to
women
i
get
bored
with
dilly
sometimes
you
looking
forward
to
going
back
to
school
shall
like
the
society
of
boys
of
my
own
sex
again
he
said
grandly
not
always
very
nice
to
dilly
archie
i
noticed
when
anything
is
given
to
her
you
always
snatch
at
it
you
must
remember
ladies
first
that
all
very
well
but
then
dilly
takes
it
all
and
only
gives
me
what
left
archie
looked
solemn
chapter
xii
said
bruce
next
morning
with
some
importance
of
manner
had
a
letter
from
aylmer
aylmer
ross
you
know
asking
me
particularly
to
call
on
him
really
said
edith
who
knew
it
already
as
she
had
asked
him
to
write
to
bruce
wants
me
to
come
at
four
said
bruce
looking
over
the
letter
pompously
to
the
minute
i
shall
certainly
do
it
i
sha
lose
a
minute
afraid
you
have
to
lose
a
few
minutes
said
edith
only
ten
bruce
stared
at
her
folded
up
the
letter
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
he
thought
it
would
be
a
suitable
punishment
for
her
not
to
see
it
obviously
he
was
not
in
the
best
of
humours
not
being
sure
what
was
wrong
edith
adopted
the
simple
plan
of
asking
what
he
meant
do
i
mean
exclaimed
bruce
who
when
his
grievances
were
vague
relied
on
such
echoes
for
his
most
cutting
effects
ask
me
what
i
mean
mean
indeed
he
took
some
toast
and
repeated
bitterly
you
may
well
ask
me
what
i
mean
i
well
what
were
the
observations
you
did
approve
of
what
you
said
about
several
minutes
being
lost
before
four
bruce
dear
i
did
mean
any
harm
by
it
indeed
repeated
bruce
it
is
a
question
of
actual
harm
i
do
say
that
you
meant
to
injure
me
nor
even
perhaps
to
hurt
my
feelings
but
it
a
way
of
speaking
a
tone
that
i
think
extremely
from
you
to
me
do
you
follow
me
edith
from
to
a
dark
saying
well
whatever
i
said
i
take
it
back
if
you
do
like
it
will
that
do
bruce
was
mollified
but
would
show
it
at
once
he
said
all
very
well
these
sort
of
things
are
not
so
easily
taken
back
you
should
think
before
you
speak
prevention
is
better
than
cure
and
a
stitch
in
time
saves
nine
though
it
does
rhyme
and
no
good
crying
over
spilt
milk
and
two
heads
are
better
than
one
but
really
bruce
i
did
mean
it
did
you
mean
heavens
i
really
do
know
by
now
i
afraid
i
utterly
forgotten
what
we
were
talking
about
said
edith
looking
at
the
door
with
some
anxiety
she
was
hoping
that
madame
frabelle
would
soon
come
down
and
cause
a
diversion
here
edith
said
bruce
an
old
friend
an
old
friend
of
yours
and
mine
and
at
one
time
a
very
intimate
friend
next
door
to
a
brother
when
such
a
friend
as
that
has
been
wounded
at
the
front
fighting
for
our
country
and
mind
you
he
behaved
with
remarkable
gallantry
for
it
was
really
necessary
for
him
to
go
as
he
was
beyond
the
age
well
when
a
friend
does
a
thing
like
that
and
comes
back
wounded
and
writes
with
his
own
hand
asking
me
to
go
and
see
him
well
i
think
it
the
least
i
can
do
i
do
know
what
think
it
seems
to
the
right
thing
if
you
disagree
with
me
very
sorry
but
frankly
it
appears
to
me
that
i
ought
to
go
could
doubt
it
the
letter
for
yourself
said
bruce
suddenly
taking
it
out
of
his
pocket
and
giving
it
to
her
you
see
dear
ottley
he
says
here
bruce
went
to
her
side
of
the
table
and
leant
over
her
reading
the
letter
aloud
to
her
over
her
shoulder
while
she
was
reading
it
to
herself
dear
ottley
if
you
could
look
in
tomorrow
about
four
i
should
be
very
glad
to
see
you
yours
sincerely
aylmer
ross
fairly
cordial
i
think
is
it
or
not
perhaps
you
think
it
cold
would
you
call
it
a
formal
letter
bruce
took
the
letter
out
of
her
hand
and
read
it
over
again
to
himself
nice
dear
said
edith
i
thought
he
put
it
away
with
a
triumphant
air
edith
was
thinking
that
the
writing
was
growing
stronger
aylmer
must
be
better
say
i
hope
it
is
a
sign
he
not
so
well
that
he
wants
to
see
me
i
do
call
it
a
good
sign
he
depressed
he
thinks
cheer
him
up
i
sure
you
will
ah
here
madame
frabelle
afraid
i
a
little
late
said
their
guest
with
her
amiable
smile
dear
no
not
at
all
not
at
all
said
bruce
who
was
really
much
annoyed
at
her
unpunctuality
course
if
you
been
a
minute
later
i
should
have
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
at
all
before
i
went
to
the
office
that
all
and
what
does
that
matter
good
heavens
of
no
importance
good
gracious
this
is
liberty
hall
i
hope
is
it
i
should
be
very
sorry
for
my
guests
to
feel
tied
in
any
way
bound
to
be
down
at
any
particular
time
will
you
have
some
coffee
edith
give
madame
frabelle
a
cup
of
coffee
late
oh
dear
no
certainly
not
he
gave
a
short
ironical
laugh
i
think
i
generally
fairly
punctual
said
madame
frabelle
beginning
her
breakfast
without
appearing
to
feel
this
sarcasm
made
me
late
this
morning
was
that
archie
and
dilly
came
into
my
room
and
asked
me
to
settle
a
kind
of
dispute
they
were
having
regard
you
quite
as
a
magistrate
said
edith
it
was
too
bad
of
them
to
come
and
bother
you
so
early
no
not
at
all
i
assure
you
i
enjoy
it
and
besides
a
boy
with
archie
musical
talents
is
bound
to
have
the
artistic
temperament
you
know
and
well
of
course
we
all
know
what
that
leads
to
excitement
and
finally
a
quarrel
sometimes
he
were
really
musical
i
should
have
thought
he
ought
to
be
more
harmonious
edith
said
by
the
way
edith
did
you
consult
landi
about
him
bruce
inquired
said
you
intended
to
yes
i
did
landi
can
see
no
sign
of
musical
genius
yet
dear
said
bruce
but
i
am
convinced
he
wrong
wait
a
few
years
and
you
find
he
agree
with
me
yet
said
madame
frabelle
not
at
all
sure
either
that
a
composer
like
landi
is
necessarily
the
right
person
to
judge
of
youthful
genius
not
and
yet
you
think
he
know
a
bit
about
it
too
i
mean
to
say
they
would
have
made
him
a
baronet
if
he
did
understand
his
profession
excuse
my
saying
so
wo
you
at
all
she
answered
does
follow
i
mean
it
does
follow
that
he
right
about
archie
did
he
try
the
boy
voice
she
asked
edith
much
he
asked
archie
to
sing
a
few
notes
did
he
he
did
but
they
were
the
notes
landi
asked
him
to
sing
landi
played
him
two
tunes
and
found
he
did
know
one
from
the
other
what
of
that
at
all
except
that
it
showed
he
had
no
ear
as
well
as
no
voice
that
is
all
madame
frabelle
would
never
own
she
was
beaten
well
well
she
said
shaking
her
head
in
an
oracular
way
wait
i
shall
the
way
i
may
be
a
little
late
for
dinner
tonight
i
going
to
see
an
old
friend
who
been
wounded
in
the
war
bruce
told
madame
frabelle
proudly
it
had
always
been
something
of
an
ordeal
to
edith
when
she
knew
that
aylmer
and
bruce
were
alone
together
it
was
a
curious
feeling
combined
of
loyalty
to
bruce
she
hated
him
to
make
himself
ridiculous
loyalty
to
aylmer
and
an
indescribable
sense
of
being
lowered
in
her
own
eyes
when
they
seemed
friendly
together
it
pained
her
most
women
will
understand
the
sensation
however
she
knew
it
had
to
be
and
would
be
glad
when
it
was
over
chapter
xiii
the
next
evening
bruce
came
in
holding
himself
very
straight
with
a
slightly
military
manner
when
he
saw
his
wife
he
just
stopped
himself
from
saluting
a
man
he
exclaimed
a
splendid
fellow
edith
did
answer
do
appreciate
him
in
my
opinion
aylmer
ross
is
a
hero
hope
he
better
he
would
say
so
anyhow
ah
he
a
wonderful
chap
bruce
hummed
tipperary
below
his
breath
edith
was
surprised
to
find
herself
suffering
no
less
mental
discomfort
and
irritation
while
bruce
talked
about
aylmer
and
praised
him
than
she
used
to
feel
years
ago
it
seemed
as
if
three
years
had
passed
and
altered
nothing
she
answered
coldly
bruce
became
more
enthusiastic
he
declared
that
she
did
know
how
to
value
such
a
fine
character
he
repeated
know
a
hero
when
they
see
one
evidently
if
bruce
had
had
his
way
aylmer
would
have
been
covered
with
dso
and
vc
nothing
was
good
enough
for
him
on
the
other
hand
if
edith
had
praised
aylmer
bruce
would
have
been
the
first
to
his
actions
undervalue
his
gifts
and
crab
him
generally
edith
was
not
one
of
those
women
far
more
common
than
is
supposed
who
consider
themselves
aggrieved
and
injured
when
a
discarded
lover
consoles
himself
with
someone
else
nor
was
she
one
of
the
numerous
people
who
will
not
throw
away
what
they
no
longer
want
for
fear
someone
else
will
pick
it
up
she
had
such
a
strong
sympathy
for
dulcie
clay
that
she
had
said
to
herself
several
times
she
would
like
to
see
her
perfectly
happy
edith
was
convinced
that
the
nurse
adored
her
patient
but
she
was
not
at
all
sure
that
he
returned
the
admiration
edith
herself
had
only
seen
him
alone
once
and
on
that
occasion
they
had
said
hardly
anything
to
each
other
he
had
been
constrained
and
she
had
been
embarrassed
the
day
that
arthur
coniston
was
there
and
they
talked
of
pictures
aylmer
had
given
her
by
a
look
to
understand
that
he
would
like
to
see
her
again
alone
and
she
knew
perfectly
well
even
without
that
that
he
was
longing
for
another
however
the
next
day
edith
went
with
madame
frabelle
this
was
a
strangely
unsatisfactory
visit
edith
knew
his
looks
and
every
tone
of
his
voice
so
well
that
she
could
see
that
aylmer
unlike
everybody
else
was
not
in
the
least
charmed
with
madame
frabelle
she
bored
him
he
saw
nothing
in
her
madame
frabelle
was
still
more
disappointed
she
had
been
told
he
was
brilliant
he
said
nothing
put
commonplaces
he
was
supposed
to
be
witty
he
answered
everything
she
said
literally
he
was
said
to
be
a
man
of
encyclopaedic
information
but
when
madame
frabelle
questioned
him
on
such
subjects
his
answers
were
dry
and
short
and
when
she
tried
to
draw
him
out
about
the
war
he
changed
the
subject
in
a
manner
that
was
not
very
far
from
being
positively
rude
leaving
them
for
a
moment
edith
went
to
talk
to
dulcie
do
you
think
he
getting
on
she
said
getting
well
gradually
he
seems
a
little
nervous
the
last
day
or
so
you
think
he
been
seeing
too
many
people
has
seen
more
than
the
doctor
has
allowed
but
do
you
know
ottley
i
think
it
depends
a
great
deal
who
the
people
are
she
waited
a
moment
and
then
went
on
in
a
low
voice
do
him
more
good
than
anyone
you
see
he
known
you
so
long
she
added
gently
so
intimately
it
no
strain
i
mean
he
has
got
to
make
conversation
i
see
said
edith
ross
has
any
near
relations
no
mother
or
sister
you
seem
to
take
their
place
if
you
understand
what
i
mean
edith
thought
it
charmingly
tactful
of
her
to
put
it
like
that
sure
take
their
place
edith
said
dulcie
looked
down
of
course
he
has
to
make
any
effort
with
me
but
then
amuse
him
and
he
wants
amusement
and
change
it
a
great
bore
for
a
man
like
that
so
active
mentally
and
in
every
way
to
have
to
lie
perfectly
still
especially
when
he
has
no
companion
but
me
i
rather
dull
in
some
ways
besides
i
do
know
anything
about
the
subjects
he
interested
in
talk
nonsense
said
edith
smiling
should
imagine
that
just
to
look
at
you
would
be
sufficient
ottley
how
can
you
she
turned
away
as
if
rather
pained
than
pleased
at
the
compliment
have
very
high
spirits
she
said
not
sure
that
i
sometimes
depress
him
the
contrary
i
sure
he
would
like
a
breezy
restless
person
bouncing
about
the
room
and
roaring
with
laughter
edith
said
she
smiled
not
but
there
might
be
something
between
he
will
be
able
to
go
for
a
drive
in
a
week
or
two
i
wondered
whether
perhaps
you
could
take
him
out
yes
i
dare
say
that
could
be
arranged
have
to
go
out
all
tomorrow
afternoon
i
wondered
whether
you
would
come
and
sit
with
him
mrs
ottley
i
will
if
you
like
please
do
i
know
he
worrying
much
more
about
his
son
than
anybody
thinks
you
see
the
boy
really
very
young
and
i
not
sure
he
strong
suppose
neither
of
them
told
the
truth
about
their
age
said
edith
reminds
one
of
the
joke
in
where
do
you
expect
to
go
if
you
tell
lies
to
the
front
miss
clay
gave
a
little
laugh
then
she
started
a
bell
was
heard
ringing
rather
loudly
tell
him
you
coming
tomorrow
then
she
said
they
returned
to
aylmer
room
he
was
looking
a
little
sulky
he
said
as
edith
came
in
thought
you
gone
without
saying
what
on
earth
were
you
doing
talking
to
miss
clay
said
edith
sitting
down
by
him
sweet
she
is
said
madame
frabelle
pretty
too
a
good
nurse
said
aylmer
briefly
been
awfully
good
to
me
but
i
do
hope
i
sha
need
her
much
longer
he
spoke
with
unnecessary
fervour
mr
ross
exclaimed
madame
frabelle
sure
if
i
were
a
young
man
i
should
be
very
sorry
when
she
had
to
leave
me
however
you
not
a
young
man
neither
am
i
there
was
a
moment
silence
this
was
really
an
exceptional
thing
when
madame
frabelle
was
present
edith
could
not
recall
one
occasion
when
eglantine
had
had
nothing
to
say
aylmer
must
have
been
excessively
snubbing
extraordinary
i
wonder
of
wonders
he
had
actually
silenced
madame
frabelle
all
aylmer
natural
politeness
and
amiability
returned
when
they
rose
to
take
their
leave
he
suddenly
became
cordial
cheery
and
charming
evidently
he
was
so
delighted
the
visitor
was
going
that
it
quite
raised
his
spirits
when
they
left
he
gave
edith
a
little
reproachful
look
he
did
not
ask
her
to
come
again
he
was
afraid
she
would
bring
madame
frabelle
edith
i
thoroughly
understand
your
husband
for
that
man
said
madame
frabelle
meaning
she
thoroughly
misunderstood
it
been
studying
his
character
all
this
afternoon
tell
me
what
you
think
of
him
i
sorry
to
say
it
but
it
a
hard
cold
cruel
nature
it
really
aylmer
ross
does
know
what
it
is
to
feel
emotion
sentiment
or
tenderness
principle
he
has
perhaps
and
no
doubt
he
thinks
he
has
great
but
that
only
because
he
absolutely
incapable
of
passion
of
any
kind
edith
smiled
see
you
amused
at
my
being
right
again
it
is
an
odd
thing
about
me
i
must
own
i
never
make
a
mistake
said
madame
frabelle
complacently
as
they
walked
home
she
continued
to
discourse
eloquently
on
the
subject
of
aylmer
she
explained
him
almost
entirely
away
there
was
nothing
madame
frabelle
fancied
herself
more
on
than
physiognomy
she
pointed
out
to
edith
how
the
brow
showed
a
narrow
mind
the
mouth
bitterness
how
extraordinarily
bored
aylmer
must
have
been
to
give
that
impression
of
all
others
thought
her
listener
and
the
eyes
particularly
gave
away
his
chief
characteristic
the
thing
that
one
missed
most
in
his
personality
what
is
that
you
see
i
do
think
i
can
has
no
sense
of
humour
said
madame
frabelle
triumphantly
after
a
few
moment
pause
edith
said
do
you
think
of
miss
clay
very
pretty
extremely
pretty
but
i
do
quite
like
to
say
what
i
think
of
her
i
rather
not
do
ask
me
it
does
concern
me
bad
as
that
oh
do
tell
me
you
so
interesting
about
character
eglantine
edith
how
kind
of
you
well
she
very
very
clever
of
course
most
intellectual
a
remarkable
brain
i
should
say
but
she
deep
and
scheming
it
a
sly
treacherous
face
i
ca
see
that
madame
frabelle
put
her
hand
on
edith
shoulder
they
had
just
reached
the
house
you
do
know
so
much
of
life
as
i
do
my
dear
should
have
said
she
is
certainly
not
at
all
above
the
average
in
cleverness
and
i
think
her
particularly
simple
and
frank
but
that
all
put
on
you
see
i
right
some
day
however
it
does
matter
no
doubt
she
a
very
good
nurse
abuse
her
to
bruce
said
edith
as
they
went
in
not
but
why
do
you
mind
do
know
i
suppose
i
like
her
madame
frabelle
laughed
strange
you
are
she
lowered
her
voice
as
they
walked
upstairs
and
said
tell
the
real
truth
she
gave
me
a
shiver
down
the
spine
i
believe
that
girl
capable
of
anything
that
dark
skin
with
those
pale
blue
eyes
i
strongly
suspect
she
has
a
touch
of
the
tarbrush
dear
nonsense
you
ca
have
looked
at
her
fine
little
features
and
her
white
hands
is
she
so
dark
may
have
been
italian
or
spanish
blood
in
her
family
said
edith
laughing
not
a
symptom
of
crime
may
indeed
replied
madame
frabelle
in
a
tone
of
deep
meaning
as
they
reached
the
door
of
her
room
mark
my
words
edith
a
dangerous
woman
an
event
had
occurred
in
the
ottley
household
during
their
absence
archie
had
brought
home
a
dog
and
implored
his
mother
to
let
him
keep
it
sort
of
dog
is
it
asked
edith
and
look
at
it
it
is
any
particular
it
just
a
dog
my
dear
boy
you
going
to
school
the
day
after
tomorrow
and
you
ca
take
it
with
you
know
but
i
teach
dilly
to
look
after
it
it
was
a
queer
rough
creature
it
seemed
harmless
enough
a
sort
of
dobbin
in
in
the
canine
world
an
inconsistent
dog
its
face
is
like
a
terrier
and
its
tail
like
a
sort
of
spaniel
said
archie
i
think
it
might
be
trained
to
a
bloodhound
do
do
you
what
use
would
a
bloodhound
be
to
dilly
you
never
know
it
might
be
very
useful
afraid
there
not
room
in
the
house
for
it
mother
both
the
children
cried
together
keep
it
it
lost
she
asked
archie
frowned
at
dilly
who
was
beginning
to
say
exactly
me
how
you
got
it
was
just
walking
along
and
i
took
its
chain
the
chain
was
dragging
on
the
ground
stole
it
said
dilly
archie
flew
at
her
but
edith
kept
him
back
it
i
did
its
master
had
walked
on
and
evidently
did
care
a
bit
about
it
poor
thing
that
not
stealing
master
archie
wants
to
keep
a
lot
of
dogs
he
had
better
take
them
with
him
to
school
said
the
nurse
do
want
nothing
to
do
with
no
dogs
not
in
this
nursery
only
one
thing
to
be
done
archie
you
must
take
care
of
it
for
the
next
day
or
two
and
i
shall
advertise
in
the
paper
for
its
master
mother
you
see
it
is
even
honest
to
keep
it
archie
was
bitterly
disappointed
but
consoled
at
the
idea
of
seeing
the
advertisement
in
the
paper
can
we
advertise
it
we
do
know
what
name
it
answers
to
would
certainly
be
difficult
to
describe
said
edith
they
had
tried
every
name
they
had
ever
heard
of
and
dilly
declared
it
had
answered
to
them
all
if
answering
meant
jumping
rather
wildly
round
them
and
barking
as
if
in
the
very
highest
spirits
it
certainly
had
be
fun
to
see
my
name
in
the
paper
said
archie
thoughtfully
you
wo
see
your
name
in
the
paper
i
found
it
said
archie
rather
sulkily
but
you
had
no
right
to
find
it
and
still
less
to
bring
it
home
i
do
know
what
your
father
will
say
bruce
at
once
said
that
it
must
be
taken
to
scotland
yard
dilly
cried
bitterly
and
said
she
wanted
it
to
eat
out
of
her
hand
and
save
her
life
in
a
snowstorm
not
a
st
bernard
you
utter
little
fool
said
her
brother
it
might
save
me
from
drowning
said
dilly
she
had
once
seen
a
picture
which
she
longed
to
realise
of
a
dog
swimming
holding
a
child
in
its
mouth
she
thought
it
ought
to
be
called
faithful
or
rover
all
these
romantic
visions
had
to
be
given
up
madame
frabelle
said
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
take
it
at
once
to
the
battersea
dogs
home
where
it
would
be
with
companions
of
its
own
age
immediately
after
dinner
her
suggestion
was
carried
out
to
the
great
relief
of
most
of
the
household
the
nurse
said
when
it
had
gone
that
she
had
all
along
it
was
mad
but
did
like
to
say
so
it
took
such
a
fancy
to
me
said
archie
that
was
why
said
dilly
the
children
were
separated
by
force
chapter
xiv
for
a
woman
who
was
sensitive
and
thoughtful
edith
had
a
singularly
happy
disposition
first
she
was
not
touchy
not
easily
offended
about
trifles
such
vanity
as
she
had
was
not
in
an
uneasy
condition
she
cared
very
little
for
general
admiration
and
had
no
feeling
for
competition
she
was
without
ambition
to
be
superior
to
others
then
though
she
saw
more
deeply
into
things
than
the
generality
of
women
she
was
not
fond
of
dwelling
on
the
sad
side
of
life
very
small
things
pleased
her
while
trifles
did
not
annoy
her
hers
was
not
the
placidity
of
the
stupid
fat
contented
person
who
never
troubles
about
other
people
she
was
rather
of
a
philosophical
turn
and
her
philosophy
tended
to
seeing
the
brighter
side
where
she
was
singularly
fortunate
was
that
though
she
felt
pleasure
deeply
a
temperament
that
feels
pain
in
proportion
her
suffering
though
acute
seldom
lasted
long
there
was
an
elasticity
in
her
disposition
that
made
her
rebound
quickly
from
a
blow
her
affections
were
intense
but
she
did
not
suffer
the
usual
penalty
of
love
a
continual
dread
of
losing
the
loved
object
if
she
adored
her
children
and
was
thankful
for
their
health
and
beauty
she
was
not
exactly
what
is
called
an
anxious
mother
she
thought
much
about
them
and
was
very
determined
to
have
her
own
way
in
anything
concerning
them
that
indeed
was
a
subject
on
which
she
would
give
way
to
but
as
she
had
so
far
succeeded
in
directing
them
according
to
her
own
ideas
she
was
satisfied
and
she
was
very
hopeful
she
could
look
forward
to
happiness
but
troubles
she
dealt
with
as
they
arose
certainly
after
the
first
few
months
of
their
marriage
bruce
had
turned
out
a
disappointment
but
now
that
she
knew
him
knew
the
worst
of
him
she
did
not
think
bad
he
had
an
irritating
personality
but
most
people
had
to
live
with
someone
who
was
a
little
irritating
and
she
was
so
accustomed
to
his
various
ways
and
weaknesses
that
she
could
deal
with
them
unmoved
almost
mechanically
she
did
not
take
him
seriously
she
would
greatly
have
preferred
of
course
that
he
should
understand
her
that
she
could
look
up
to
him
and
lean
on
him
but
as
this
was
not
so
she
made
the
best
of
it
and
managed
to
be
contented
enough
three
years
ago
she
had
not
even
known
she
could
be
deeply
in
love
she
had
loved
aylmer
ross
but
even
at
that
time
when
bruce
gave
her
the
opportunity
by
his
wild
escapade
with
miss
argles
to
free
herself
and
marry
aylmer
her
ideal
of
divine
happiness
at
the
time
somehow
she
could
not
do
it
she
had
a
curious
sense
of
responsibility
towards
bruce
which
came
in
the
way
often
since
then
she
had
had
regrets
she
had
even
felt
it
had
been
a
mistake
to
throw
away
such
a
chance
but
she
reflected
that
she
would
have
regrets
anyhow
it
would
have
worried
her
to
know
that
bruce
needed
her
for
all
that
she
knew
he
did
if
unconsciously
so
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
content
herself
with
a
life
which
though
peaceful
was
certainly
to
her
temperament
decidedly
incomplete
edith
had
other
sources
of
happiness
more
acute
than
that
of
the
average
she
took
an
intense
and
keen
enjoyment
in
life
itself
everything
interested
her
amused
her
she
was
never
bored
she
so
much
enjoyed
the
mere
spectacle
of
life
that
she
never
required
to
be
the
central
figure
when
she
had
to
play
the
part
of
a
mere
spectator
it
did
depress
her
she
could
delight
in
society
and
in
character
as
if
at
a
theatre
on
the
other
hand
as
she
had
a
good
deal
of
initiative
and
a
strong
personality
she
could
also
revel
in
action
in
playing
a
principal
part
under
a
quiet
manner
her
courage
was
daring
and
her
spirit
high
unless
someone
or
something
was
actively
tormenting
her
to
an
extent
quite
insupportable
she
was
contented
even
gay
her
past
romance
with
aylmer
had
naturally
opened
to
her
a
source
of
delight
that
she
knew
nothing
of
before
since
she
had
seen
him
again
she
scarcely
knew
how
she
felt
about
it
this
day
she
was
to
see
him
again
alone
because
he
wished
it
and
because
dulcie
clay
had
begged
her
to
gratify
the
wish
why
was
it
she
asked
herself
that
the
little
nurse
desired
they
should
be
alone
together
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
a
woman
with
penetration
that
dulcie
was
in
love
with
aylmer
also
she
was
equally
sure
that
the
girl
believed
aylmer
to
be
devoted
to
her
edith
then
it
must
be
the
purest
unselfishness
dulcie
probably
she
thought
loved
him
with
a
kind
of
hopeless
worship
she
had
seen
him
ill
and
weak
she
pitied
him
she
wanted
him
to
be
happy
in
return
for
this
generosity
edith
felt
a
generous
kindness
for
her
a
sympathy
that
she
would
never
have
believed
she
could
feel
at
seeing
such
a
beautiful
girl
on
those
rather
intimate
terms
with
aylmer
it
must
mean
simply
that
edith
knew
aylmer
cared
for
her
still
a
look
was
enough
to
convince
her
that
at
least
he
still
took
a
great
and
deep
interest
in
her
and
she
wanted
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
him
or
she
could
have
avoided
a
during
the
three
years
he
had
been
away
the
feeling
had
calmed
down
but
the
ideal
was
still
there
and
the
memory
whenever
bruce
was
maddening
which
was
fairly
often
when
she
heard
music
when
she
saw
beautiful
scenery
when
she
was
reading
a
romantic
book
when
any
other
man
admired
her
aylmer
was
always
in
her
thoughts
when
edith
saw
him
again
she
was
not
sure
that
she
had
not
worn
out
her
passion
by
dwelling
on
it
but
that
might
easily
be
caused
by
the
mere
of
the
first
two
or
three
meetings
there
is
a
shyness
a
sort
of
coldness
in
meeting
again
a
person
one
has
passionately
loved
to
see
the
dream
in
flesh
and
blood
the
thought
made
concrete
once
more
brings
poetry
down
to
prose
then
the
terms
they
met
on
now
were
changed
he
was
playing
such
a
different
part
instead
of
the
strong
determined
man
who
had
voluntarily
left
her
refusing
to
know
her
as
a
friend
and
reproaching
her
bitterly
for
playing
with
him
as
he
called
it
here
was
a
broken
invalid
a
pathetic
figure
who
appealed
to
entirely
different
sentiments
there
is
naturally
something
maternal
in
a
woman
feeling
to
a
sick
man
there
was
also
the
halo
that
surrounds
the
wounded
hero
he
was
not
ill
through
weakness
but
through
strength
and
courage
she
found
herself
thinking
of
him
day
and
night
but
it
was
in
a
different
way
it
might
be
because
he
had
not
yet
referred
to
their
past
love
affair
edith
dressed
with
unusual
care
to
go
and
see
him
today
even
if
a
woman
wishes
to
discourage
or
to
break
off
all
relations
with
a
man
she
does
after
all
wish
to
leave
a
disagreeable
impression
her
prettiness
and
charm
of
which
she
was
modestly
but
confidently
aware
by
her
experience
of
its
effect
was
a
great
satisfaction
it
was
remarkably
noticeable
today
in
front
of
the
glass
edith
hesitated
between
her
favourite
plain
sailor
hat
and
a
new
black
velvet
toque
which
shaded
her
eyes
contrasting
with
the
fair
hair
of
which
very
little
showed
and
giving
her
an
aspect
of
dashing
yet
discreet
coquetry
she
looked
younger
in
the
other
sailor
hat
so
she
decided
when
she
put
it
on
again
and
more
as
she
used
to
look
which
was
the
more
attractive
she
decided
on
novelty
and
went
out
finally
in
the
toque
of
course
only
another
woman
could
have
appreciated
the
remarkable
fact
that
she
could
wear
at
such
a
small
hat
and
yet
look
fresh
certainly
a
brim
was
more
flattering
to
most
women
of
her
age
but
the
contour
of
edith
face
was
still
as
youthful
as
ever
she
had
one
of
those
clearly
shaped
oval
faces
that
are
not
disposed
to
growing
thick
and
broad
or
to
haggardness
the
oval
might
be
a
shade
wider
than
it
was
three
years
ago
that
was
all
the
more
becoming
did
it
not
make
the
features
look
smaller
as
she
went
out
she
laughed
at
herself
for
giving
so
much
thought
to
her
appearance
it
was
as
though
she
believed
she
was
going
to
play
an
important
part
in
the
chief
scene
of
a
play
once
dressed
as
usual
she
lost
all
and
thought
of
outside
things
miss
clay
was
out
as
she
had
told
edith
she
would
be
and
the
servant
showed
her
in
she
saw
at
once
that
aylmer
also
had
been
looking
forward
to
this
moment
with
some
excitement
he
too
had
dressed
with
special
care
and
she
knew
without
being
told
that
orders
had
been
given
to
receive
no
other
visitors
he
was
sitting
in
an
with
the
bandaged
leg
on
the
other
chair
a
small
table
by
his
side
laid
for
tea
even
a
kettle
was
boiling
no
doubt
to
avoid
interruption
it
was
his
old
brown
library
where
she
had
occasionally
seen
him
with
others
in
the
old
days
but
this
was
literally
the
first
time
she
had
seen
him
in
his
own
house
alone
it
was
essentially
a
man
room
comfortable
but
not
exactly
luxurious
very
little
was
sacrificed
to
decoration
there
were
a
few
very
old
dark
pictures
on
the
walls
the
room
was
crammed
with
books
in
long
low
bookcases
on
the
mantelpiece
was
a
pewter
vase
of
carnations
an
uncut
was
in
his
hand
but
he
threw
it
on
the
floor
with
a
characteristic
gesture
as
she
came
in
look
very
comfortable
said
edith
as
she
took
her
seat
in
the
placed
for
her
he
answered
gravely
speaking
in
his
direct
quick
way
with
his
sincere
manner
was
very
good
of
you
to
come
i
pour
out
your
tea
let
have
tea
and
get
it
over
she
laughed
took
off
her
gloves
and
he
watched
her
fingers
as
they
occupied
themselves
with
the
china
as
though
he
were
impatient
for
the
ceremony
to
be
finished
while
she
poured
it
out
and
handed
it
to
him
he
said
not
a
word
she
saw
that
he
looked
pale
and
seemed
rather
nervous
each
tried
to
put
the
other
at
ease
more
by
looks
than
words
edith
saw
it
would
worry
him
to
make
conversation
they
knew
each
other
well
enough
to
exchange
ideas
without
words
he
had
something
to
say
and
she
would
not
postpone
it
that
would
irritate
him
said
aylmer
giving
a
little
push
to
the
table
you
want
any
more
tea
thanks
do
you
mind
coming
a
little
nearer
she
lifted
the
little
table
put
it
farther
behind
his
chair
placed
the
closer
to
him
by
the
fire
and
sat
down
again
he
looked
at
her
for
some
time
with
a
serious
expression
then
he
said
rather
abruptly
and
unexpectedly
a
jolly
hat
i
glad
you
like
it
exclaimed
edith
was
afraid
you
hate
it
for
the
first
time
they
were
talking
in
their
old
tone
she
reflected
i
like
it
i
love
it
he
lowered
his
voice
to
say
this
glad
she
repeated
i
love
you
said
aylmer
as
abruptly
and
in
a
still
lower
voice
she
did
answer
here
edith
i
want
to
ask
you
something
he
seemed
to
have
some
difficulty
in
speaking
he
was
agitated
you
forgotten
me
can
see
i
have
or
i
would
be
here
she
answered
fence
with
me
i
mean
really
are
you
the
same
as
when
i
went
away
do
you
think
we
had
better
talk
about
it
must
i
must
i
ca
endure
the
torture
of
seeing
you
just
like
anybody
else
you
know
i
told
you
he
stopped
a
moment
told
me
you
never
be
a
mere
friend
she
said
so
different
now
is
different
that
where
you
wrong
you
just
the
same
and
so
am
i
except
that
i
care
for
you
far
more
than
i
ever
did
aylmer
i
thought
i
was
dying
i
showed
your
little
photograph
to
miss
clay
i
told
her
all
about
it
i
suppose
i
was
rather
mad
it
was
just
after
an
operation
it
does
matter
a
bit
she
would
ever
say
a
word
sure
she
would
had
to
confide
in
somebody
he
went
on
told
her
to
send
you
back
the
photograph
and
i
told
her
that
my
greatest
wish
was
to
see
you
again
my
dear
boy
we
have
met
again
do
change
your
mind
from
what
you
said
last
i
mean
when
you
went
away
she
spoke
in
an
imploring
tone
you
wish
to
be
friends
then
she
hesitated
a
moment
then
said
i
do
chapter
xv
after
a
moment
pause
he
said
say
everything
changed
in
a
way
it
is
i
look
at
things
differently
i
regard
them
differently
when
you
been
up
against
it
and
seen
life
and
death
pretty
close
you
realise
what
utter
rot
it
is
to
live
so
much
for
the
world
edith
stared
does
it
make
you
feel
all
the
more
the
importance
of
principle
goodness
and
religion
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
expected
it
would
with
you
no
it
does
now
let
us
look
at
the
situation
quietly
after
an
agitated
pause
he
went
on
far
as
i
make
out
you
sacrificing
yourself
to
bruce
when
he
ran
away
with
that
girl
and
begged
you
to
divorce
him
you
could
have
done
it
you
cared
for
me
everything
would
have
been
right
even
before
the
world
would
have
blamed
you
yet
you
would
that
for
the
world
aylmer
you
do
understand
it
was
for
myself
something
in
me
which
i
ca
help
i
felt
bruce
needed
me
and
would
go
wrong
without
me
should
you
care
did
he
consider
you
is
the
point
dear
boy
i
felt
as
if
he
was
my
son
so
to
speak
a
sort
of
feeling
of
responsibility
quite
it
was
quixotic
rubbish
that
my
opinion
there
edith
said
nothing
remembering
he
was
still
he
went
on
he
run
away
from
you
he
stayed
with
you
for
three
years
utterly
incapable
of
appreciating
you
as
i
know
he
is
bothering
you
to
death
aylmer
i
know
him
you
wasting
and
frittering
yourself
away
for
nothing
children
you
think
i
have
looked
after
the
children
better
than
he
i
do
aylmer
but
he
their
father
they
may
keep
him
straight
consider
you
utterly
wasted
he
said
he
stuck
to
you
apparently
for
these
last
three
years
as
far
as
you
know
and
now
going
to
ask
you
something
entirely
different
for
the
last
time
when
i
was
dying
or
thought
i
was
things
showed
themselves
clearly
enough
i
can
tell
you
and
i
made
up
my
mind
if
i
lived
to
see
you
to
say
this
leave
bruce
with
me
she
stared
at
him
six
weeks
when
he
tired
of
telling
his
friends
at
the
club
about
it
he
make
up
his
mind
i
suppose
if
you
insist
or
even
without
to
divorce
you
but
do
you
suppose
he
keep
the
children
no
my
dear
of
course
he
wo
you
never
have
to
leave
them
i
would
never
ask
you
that
now
listen
he
put
his
hand
over
hers
not
caressingly
but
to
keep
her
quiet
want
to
marry
again
wo
he
likely
she
answered
already
he
in
love
with
that
woman
madame
frabelle
who
staying
with
you
edith
gave
a
little
laugh
he
in
love
with
her
already
continued
aylmer
impossible
said
edith
calmly
a
very
good
sort
she
not
a
fool
like
the
girl
she
look
after
bruce
very
well
she
would
answered
edith
will
adore
her
be
under
her
thumb
and
keep
perfectly
as
you
call
it
as
straight
as
he
ever
would
wo
he
she
was
silent
get
the
children
then
do
you
see
with
a
bad
reputation
with
a
cloud
on
my
life
to
bring
up
dilly
he
sighed
impatiently
and
said
see
you
do
see
things
as
they
really
are
even
now
how
could
you
ever
possibly
hurt
dilly
only
thinking
of
what
the
world
says
now
me
out
he
went
on
this
the
only
country
after
the
war
wo
everything
be
different
thank
goodness
i
well
provided
for
you
need
take
a
farthing
leave
even
your
own
income
to
bruce
if
you
like
you
know
i
five
thousand
a
year
now
edith
did
know
it
but
that
has
nothing
on
earth
to
do
with
it
she
answered
it
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
i
can
afford
to
bring
your
children
up
as
well
as
teddy
my
boy
we
can
marry
and
in
a
year
or
two
no
one
would
think
any
more
about
it
bewilder
me
said
edith
want
to
think
it
over
do
be
weak
i
sorry
dear
to
ask
you
to
take
the
blame
on
your
side
it
unfair
but
after
all
perhaps
straighter
than
waiting
for
an
opportunity
which
you
could
easily
get
in
time
of
finding
bruce
in
the
wrong
her
face
expressed
intense
determination
and
disagreement
with
his
views
answer
me
he
said
dear
boy
you
must
let
me
answer
you
will
you
listen
to
me
on
edith
i
always
listen
to
you
do
realise
it
but
you
not
well
she
said
he
gave
an
impatient
gesture
like
a
woman
as
soon
as
i
talk
sense
you
say
i
not
well
a
broken
leg
does
affect
the
brain
remember
aylmer
i
do
mean
that
but
you
been
thinking
this
over
till
you
lost
your
bearings
your
sense
of
proportion
i
just
got
it
that
what
you
mean
it
comes
to
this
my
dear
girl
he
spoke
gently
course
if
you
do
care
for
me
my
suggestion
would
be
perfectly
mad
perhaps
you
do
probably
you
regard
our
romance
as
a
pretty
little
story
to
look
back
on
i
do
unless
wo
ask
you
straight
out
he
said
do
suppose
you
know
yourself
but
if
you
care
for
me
as
i
do
for
you
he
spoke
steadily
do
as
i
ask
might
love
you
quite
as
much
and
yet
not
do
it
know
it
a
big
thing
it
a
sacrifice
in
a
way
but
do
you
see
edith
that
if
you
still
like
me
your
present
life
is
a
long
slow
sacrifice
to
convention
or
as
you
say
to
a
morbid
sense
of
responsibility
she
looked
away
with
a
startled
expression
do
you
love
me
he
said
rather
impatiently
but
yet
with
his
old
charm
of
tenderness
and
sincerity
have
never
changed
as
you
know
after
the
operation
when
they
thought
i
was
practically
done
in
it
may
seem
a
bit
mad
but
i
was
really
more
sane
than
i
have
ever
been
i
told
dulcie
clay
all
about
it
she
stopped
him
know
you
did
my
dear
and
i
do
blame
you
a
bit
she
absolutely
loyal
but
now
listen
has
nothing
occurred
to
you
about
her
except
that
i
hoping
to
get
rid
of
her
as
soon
as
possible
madly
in
love
with
you
aylmer
he
looked
contemptuous
a
dear
girl
said
edith
feel
quite
fond
of
her
i
do
see
how
she
comes
in
you
are
perverse
edith
not
perverse
i
see
things
never
shown
the
slightest
sign
of
it
said
aylmer
think
your
imagination
but
even
if
it
not
it
is
my
business
nor
yours
think
it
is
a
little
you
talk
like
that
i
send
her
away
today
aylmer
how
ungrateful
of
you
to
say
such
a
thing
she
been
an
angel
he
spoke
wearily
do
want
i
want
he
suddenly
leant
forward
and
took
her
hands
she
laughed
nervously
a
compliment
then
she
disengaged
herself
and
stood
up
aylmer
sighed
you
going
to
say
ought
you
to
talk
so
much
what
is
your
temperature
oh
women
irritating
even
the
nicest
confound
them
edith
was
unable
to
help
laughing
afraid
i
going
to
say
something
like
that
are
you
going
to
say
you
wo
answer
me
for
fear
it
will
excite
me
talk
nonsense
said
edith
take
you
seriously
enough
worry
he
looked
delighted
heaven
most
women
treat
a
wounded
man
as
if
he
were
a
sick
child
or
a
lunatic
it
the
greatest
rot
i
nearly
well
edith
looked
round
for
his
tonic
but
stopped
herself
you
going
now
he
asked
aylmer
i
thought
of
stopping
a
few
minutes
if
you
do
mind
we
talk
of
something
else
said
aylmer
satirically
divert
my
thoughts
has
it
been
lovely
weather
lately
she
smiled
and
sat
down
again
you
like
to
know
how
soon
the
war
will
be
over
he
went
on
enough
i
really
do
know
you
going
back
when
you
recovered
she
asked
abruptly
course
i
going
back
and
i
want
to
go
back
with
your
promise
then
he
looked
a
little
edith
i
do
want
to
rush
you
forgive
me
they
both
sat
in
dead
silence
for
five
minutes
he
was
looking
at
the
black
velvet
toque
on
the
fair
hair
over
the
soft
eyes
she
was
staring
across
at
the
carnations
in
the
pewter
vase
on
the
mantelpiece
as
has
been
said
they
often
exchanged
ideas
without
words
he
remarked
as
she
glanced
at
a
book
i
have
read
life
of
have
you
do
you
think
it
good
edith
answered
a
labour
of
hate
he
laughed
true
one
ca
call
it
a
labour
of
love
though
it
was
written
to
please
the
writer
not
the
public
wonder
you
could
read
it
said
edith
what
you
been
through
took
my
thoughts
off
life
he
said
is
it
life
course
it
is
literary
life
edith
looked
at
the
clock
am
i
going
to
see
you
again
he
asked
in
a
rather
exhausted
voice
you
like
what
about
taking
you
out
for
a
drive
next
week
think
over
what
you
said
said
edith
casually
as
she
stood
up
a
funny
little
speech
you
oh
you
are
a
jolly
girl
jolly
girl
repeated
edith
not
apparently
pleased
with
a
boy
at
school
and
a
growing
girl
of
seven
think
too
much
of
the
almanac
i
with
a
son
at
the
front
on
earth
did
you
get
your
commissions
the
usual
way
teddy
and
i
told
lies
he
said
he
was
eighteen
and
i
said
i
was
see
of
course
he
rang
the
bell
you
write
to
me
dear
edith
i
come
and
see
you
aylmer
you
going
to
bring
archie
bruce
or
madame
frabelle
leave
madame
frabelle
at
home
you
do
like
her
you
might
pronounce
her
name
right
such
a
clever
woman
an
utter
fool
said
aylmer
thing
very
often
said
edith
worry
she
went
away
leaving
him
perfectly
happy
and
very
hungry
hardly
had
she
gone
when
miss
clay
came
in
and
brought
him
some
on
a
tray
chapter
xvi
to
edith
joy
as
they
entered
the
mitchell
huge
familiar
the
first
person
she
saw
was
her
beloved
confidant
sir
tito
landi
this
was
the
friend
of
all
others
whom
she
most
longed
to
see
at
this
particular
moment
the
extraordinary
confidence
and
friendship
between
the
successful
italian
composer
and
edith
ottley
needs
perhaps
a
word
of
explanation
he
was
adored
equally
in
the
artistic
and
the
social
worlds
and
was
at
once
the
most
cynical
of
don
juans
and
the
most
unworldly
of
don
quixotes
he
was
a
devoted
and
grateful
friend
and
a
contemptuous
but
not
unforgetful
enemy
it
was
not
since
his
celebrity
that
edith
had
first
met
him
she
had
known
him
intimately
all
her
life
from
her
earliest
childhood
she
had
so
to
speak
been
brought
up
on
landi
on
landi
music
and
views
of
life
he
had
been
her
mother
music
teacher
soon
after
he
first
made
a
name
in
london
and
long
before
he
was
the
star
whose
singing
or
accompanying
was
a
rare
favour
and
whose
presence
gave
a
cachet
to
any
entertainment
how
many
poor
italians
yes
and
many
people
of
other
nationalities
had
reason
to
bless
his
acquaintance
how
kind
how
how
foolishly
extravagant
on
others
was
landi
his
brilliant
cleverness
which
made
him
received
almost
as
an
englishman
among
english
people
was
not
however
the
cleverness
of
the
although
he
had
succeeded
and
success
was
his
object
no
one
could
be
less
less
pushing
less
scheming
in
many
things
he
was
a
child
he
would
as
soon
dine
at
pagani
with
a
poor
sculptor
or
a
poor
and
plain
woman
who
was
struggling
to
give
lessons
in
italian
as
with
the
most
brilliant
hostess
in
london
and
he
always
found
fashion
and
ceremony
a
bore
he
was
so
great
a
favourite
in
england
that
he
had
been
given
that
most
english
of
titles
a
knighthood
just
as
though
he
were
very
rich
or
political
or
a
popular
actor
in
a
childish
way
it
amused
him
and
he
was
pleased
with
it
but
though
he
was
remarkable
for
his
courtly
tact
he
loved
most
of
all
to
be
absolutely
free
and
bohemian
to
be
quite
natural
among
really
sympathetic
witty
or
beautiful
friends
he
liked
to
say
what
he
thought
to
go
where
he
wished
and
to
make
love
when
he
chose
not
when
other
people
chose
he
had
long
been
a
man
with
an
assured
position
but
he
had
changed
little
since
he
was
and
arrived
from
naples
with
only
his
talent
his
bright
blue
eyes
his
fair
complexion
his
small
dignified
figure
and
his
daring
humour
yet
the
music
he
wrote
indicated
his
sensitive
and
deeply
feeling
nature
and
though
his
conversation
could
hardly
be
called
other
than
cynical
nor
his
jokes
puritanical
there
was
always
in
him
a
vein
of
genuine
not
sentimental
but
perhaps
romantic
love
and
admiration
for
everything
good
good
in
music
good
in
art
good
in
character
he
laid
down
no
rules
of
what
was
good
savoir
tout
was
perhaps
his
motto
but
he
was
very
unexpected
that
was
one
of
his
charms
he
would
pass
over
the
most
extraordinary
things
envious
slights
small
injuries
things
another
man
would
never
forgive
on
the
other
hand
he
retained
a
bitter
memory
not
at
all
without
its
inclination
for
repayment
for
other
trifles
that
many
would
disregard
ever
since
she
was
a
child
edith
had
been
his
special
favourite
he
loved
the
privilege
of
calling
her
edith
of
listening
to
her
confidences
of
treating
her
with
loving
familiarity
it
was
a
joke
between
them
that
while
he
used
formerly
to
say
enfant
je
vue
en
jupe
courte
vous
savez
he
had
gradually
reached
the
point
of
declaring
vue
naître
almost
with
tears
in
his
eyes
this
explains
why
landi
was
the
only
creature
to
whom
edith
could
tell
everything
and
did
must
not
all
nice
people
have
a
confidant
and
no
girl
or
woman
friend
much
as
they
might
like
her
and
she
them
could
ever
take
the
place
of
landi
the
wise
and
there
was
something
in
his
mental
attitude
that
was
not
unfeminine
direct
and
assertive
as
he
was
he
had
what
is
generally
known
as
feminine
intuition
a
quality
perhaps
even
rarer
in
women
than
in
men
tonight
the
persistently
hospitable
mrs
mitchell
had
a
large
party
dressed
in
grey
she
was
receiving
her
guests
in
the
big
room
on
the
ground
floor
and
tactfully
directing
the
conversation
of
a
crowd
of
various
and
more
or
less
interesting
persons
it
was
one
of
those
parties
that
had
been
described
as
a
russian
salad
where
one
ran
an
equal
risk
or
took
an
equal
chance
of
being
taken
to
dinner
by
charlie
chaplin
or
winston
churchill
and
where
society
and
the
stage
were
equally
well
represented
young
officers
on
leave
and
a
few
pretty
girls
filled
the
vacancies
as
bruce
edith
and
madame
frabelle
came
in
together
landi
went
straight
to
edith
side
looking
at
her
through
his
eyeglass
he
said
as
if
to
himself
in
an
anxious
tone
a
quelquechose
cette
enfant
oui
elle
a
quelquechose
and
as
the
last
guest
had
not
arrived
he
sat
down
thoughtfully
by
her
on
the
small
sofa
landi
there
is
something
the
matter
i
longing
to
tell
you
about
it
i
want
your
advice
said
edith
smiling
se
sait
tout
se
fait
tout
sententiously
remarked
landi
who
was
not
above
talking
oracular
commonplaces
at
times
it
is
one
of
those
things
landi
are
you
sure
do
be
sad
edith
be
cheerful
tiens
tiens
tiens
how
excited
you
are
he
went
on
as
she
looked
at
him
with
perfect
composure
will
think
i
have
reason
to
be
excited
when
i
tell
you
he
smiled
in
an
experienced
way
sit
next
to
you
at
dinner
and
you
shall
tell
me
everything
tiens
la
vieille
qui
voit
double
he
bowed
politely
as
madame
frabelle
came
up
sir
tito
a
pleasure
to
see
you
again
your
lovely
songs
have
been
ringing
in
my
ears
ever
since
i
heard
them
did
you
hear
them
on
a
he
asked
too
bad
is
he
naughty
no
when
you
sang
here
last
mr
mitchell
came
up
and
madame
frabelle
turned
away
merci
la
pauvre
elle
me
donne
sur
les
nerfs
ce
soir
said
landi
shall
sit
next
to
you
whether
the
cards
are
placed
so
or
not
edith
and
you
tell
me
everything
between
the
soup
and
the
ices
will
indeed
meetchel
he
said
looking
round
through
his
eyeglass
sure
to
have
given
you
a
handsome
young
man
someone
who
ought
to
drive
bruce
wild
with
jealousy
but
does
or
or
some
celebrity
doute
the
door
opened
and
the
last
guest
appeared
it
was
young
coniston
in
khaki
who
was
invariably
asked
when
there
was
to
be
music
he
was
so
useful
he
approached
landi
at
once
cher
maître
quel
plaisir
he
said
with
his
south
kensington
accent
and
his
oxford
manner
he
had
been
a
cambridge
man
vrai
asked
landi
who
had
his
own
way
of
dismissing
a
person
in
a
friendly
way
coniston
began
talking
to
him
of
a
song
landi
waved
him
off
and
went
up
to
mrs
mitchell
said
something
which
made
her
laugh
and
blush
and
try
to
hit
him
with
her
fan
the
fan
the
assault
and
the
manner
were
all
out
of
date
but
mrs
mitchell
made
no
pretence
at
going
with
the
times
and
his
object
was
gained
sir
tito
took
edith
in
to
dinner
chapter
xvii
as
they
found
their
places
at
the
long
table
sir
tito
had
exchanged
cards
as
though
he
meant
to
fight
a
duel
with
edith
destined
partner
of
course
the
two
turned
their
backs
to
one
another
on
her
other
side
was
mr
mitchell
when
madame
frabelle
noticed
this
she
gave
edith
an
arch
shake
of
the
head
and
made
a
curious
warning
movement
with
her
hand
edith
smiled
at
her
in
astonishment
she
had
utterly
forgotten
her
friend
fancy
about
the
imaginary
intrigue
supposed
to
be
going
on
between
her
and
mr
mitchell
and
she
wondered
what
the
gesture
meant
sir
tito
also
saw
it
and
turning
round
to
edith
said
in
a
low
voice
a
la
vieille
really
do
know
i
never
understand
signs
i
forgotten
the
code
i
suppose
mr
mitchell
after
a
word
to
the
person
he
had
taken
down
gladly
turned
to
edith
he
always
complained
that
the
host
was
obliged
to
sit
between
the
oldest
and
the
most
boring
guests
it
was
unusual
for
him
to
have
so
pretty
a
neighbour
as
edith
but
he
was
a
collector
his
joy
was
to
see
a
heterogeneous
mass
of
people
eating
and
laughing
at
his
table
for
his
wife
there
were
a
few
social
people
for
him
the
bohemians
and
always
the
younger
guests
bad
not
bad
is
it
he
said
looking
critically
round
down
the
two
sides
of
the
table
while
his
kind
pink
face
beamed
with
hospitable
joy
got
a
delightful
party
tonight
i
always
say
is
said
mr
mitchell
them
enjoy
themselves
dash
it
i
hate
etiquette
he
lowered
his
voice
is
looking
pretty
blooming
not
so
many
illnesses
lately
has
he
when
he
at
home
said
edith
at
the
f
o
the
dear
fellow
does
i
afraid
suffer
a
good
deal
from
nerves
said
mr
mitchell
especially
towards
the
end
of
the
day
about
four
i
mean
you
know
you
know
old
bruce
good
sort
he
is
i
see
he
has
got
the
woman
i
meant
him
to
sit
next
to
somehow
or
other
i
see
he
next
to
miss
coniston
he
likes
her
good
thought
she
was
a
bit
too
artistic
and
as
the
americans
say
for
him
but
now
he
used
to
that
sort
of
thing
he
madame
frabelle
eh
wonderful
woman
no
soup
edith
why
not
makes
me
silent
said
edith
i
like
to
talk
mitchell
laughed
loudly
ha
champagne
for
mrs
ottley
what
are
you
about
he
looked
up
reprovingly
at
the
servant
mr
mitchell
was
the
sort
of
man
who
never
knows
after
twenty
years
intimate
friendship
whether
a
person
takes
sugar
or
not
edith
allowed
the
man
to
fill
her
glass
she
knew
it
depressed
mr
mitchell
to
see
people
drinking
water
so
she
only
did
it
surreptitiously
and
as
her
glass
was
always
full
because
she
never
drank
from
it
mr
mitchell
was
happy
a
very
loud
feminine
laugh
was
heard
miss
radford
said
mr
mitchell
how
she
always
goes
on
she
always
laughing
she
was
immensely
charmed
with
you
the
day
she
called
on
you
with
my
wife
she
said
edith
who
remembered
she
herself
had
been
out
on
that
occasion
i
ca
remember
what
she
said
i
think
it
was
how
clever
you
were
saw
madame
frabelle
i
was
at
home
ha
good
very
good
mr
mitchell
turned
to
his
other
neighbour
bien
said
sir
tito
who
was
waiting
his
opportunity
at
once
edith
began
murmuring
in
a
low
voice
her
story
of
herself
and
aylmer
and
related
today
conversation
in
jermyn
street
sir
tito
nodded
his
head
occasionally
when
he
listened
most
intently
he
appeared
to
be
looking
round
the
table
at
other
people
he
lifted
a
glass
of
champagne
and
bowed
over
it
to
mrs
mitchell
then
he
put
his
hand
to
his
lips
and
blew
a
kiss
that
for
edith
asked
interrupting
herself
pour
la
vieille
frabelle
why
do
you
kiss
your
hand
to
her
keep
her
quiet
look
at
her
she
so
impressed
and
thinks
it
so
wicked
that
she
blushing
and
uncomfortable
i
a
splendid
way
edith
pardon
of
silencing
all
these
elderly
ladies
who
make
love
to
me
i
do
say
ferme
i
polite
to
them
edith
laughed
sir
tito
was
not
offended
you
need
laugh
my
dear
child
i
not
old
enough
yet
pour
les
jeunes
at
any
rate
if
i
am
they
do
know
it
i
still
pursued
by
the
upper
class
with
gratitude
for
favours
to
come
as
they
think
what
your
plan
he
giggled
tell
madame
frabelle
madame
meetchel
lady
everard
first
that
they
have
beautiful
lips
then
that
i
ca
look
at
them
without
longing
to
kiss
them
lady
everard
after
i
said
that
kept
her
hand
before
her
face
the
whole
evening
so
as
not
to
distract
me
and
drive
me
mad
consequently
she
could
talk
they
really
believe
you
i
wonder
he
continued
mischievously
as
he
refused
wine
madame
frabelle
will
confess
to
you
tonight
about
my
passion
for
her
or
whether
she
will
keep
it
to
herself
dare
say
she
tell
me
at
least
she
ask
me
if
i
think
so
or
not
elle
te
demande
tu
diras
que
tu
sais
rien
well
i
think
must
wait
wait
and
see
really
it
impossible
my
dear
child
for
you
to
accept
an
invitation
for
an
elopement
as
if
it
were
a
not
only
that
it
good
for
aylmer
to
be
kept
in
doubt
excellent
for
his
health
i
say
his
health
i
mean
the
health
and
strength
of
his
love
for
you
you
must
vacillate
edith
souvent
femme
varie
you
sit
on
the
fence
well
offer
the
fence
to
him
but
take
it
away
before
he
sits
down
voilà
edith
laughed
then
this
girl
miss
clay
she
always
there
and
i
like
her
is
her
nationality
funny
you
should
ask
that
i
think
she
must
be
of
spanish
descent
she
so
quiet
so
religious
and
has
a
very
dark
complexion
and
yet
wonderful
light
blue
eyes
histoire
ça
fait
poor
girl
is
mad
about
aylmer
he
does
seem
to
know
it
but
he
makes
her
worse
by
his
indifference
edith
said
are
you
jealous
of
her
ma
chère
no
i
wo
ask
you
that
the
answer
is
obvious
mean
this
that
if
i
ca
ever
do
what
he
wishes
i
feel
she
could
make
him
happy
and
i
could
bear
it
if
she
did
said
landi
as
if
to
himself
olé
does
she
use
the
castanets
and
wear
a
mantilla
instead
of
a
cap
frivolous
and
silly
you
are
no
of
course
not
she
looks
quite
english
in
fact
particularly
so
yet
you
insist
she
spanish
well
my
advice
is
this
if
he
has
a
secret
alliance
with
spain
you
should
assume
the
balkan
attitude
gracious
what
that
talking
politics
said
landi
across
the
table
and
geography
fancy
meetchel
mrs
ottley
does
know
anything
about
the
balkans
very
good
said
mitchell
what
a
fellow
you
are
he
gave
his
hearty
clubbable
laugh
mr
mitchell
belonged
to
an
exceptionally
large
number
of
clubs
and
was
a
favourite
at
all
his
laugh
was
the
chief
cause
of
his
popularity
there
est
fou
said
landi
quietly
to
edith
monde
i
do
think
there
are
sane
people
at
this
table
landi
if
there
are
they
should
by
rights
be
admitted
into
decent
society
but
the
dear
meetchels
do
know
that
it
not
public
i
adore
them
both
he
went
on
changing
his
satirical
tone
and
again
apparently
drinking
the
health
of
mrs
mitchell
who
waved
her
hand
coquettishly
from
the
end
of
the
long
table
listen
my
child
do
see
aylmer
for
a
little
while
wants
me
to
take
him
out
for
a
drive
him
for
a
drive
but
not
this
week
how
madame
frabelle
loves
bruce
he
went
on
watching
her
landi
i
assure
you
you
occasionally
as
mistaken
as
she
is
and
she
thinks
i
in
love
with
our
host
because
voit
i
do
makes
you
think
read
between
the
lines
my
dear
between
the
lines
on
madame
frabelle
face
has
any
go
along
said
landi
who
sometimes
broke
into
peculiar
english
which
he
thought
was
modern
slang
raising
his
voice
he
said
dinner
is
so
that
mr
mitchell
could
hear
ca
help
noting
what
you
eaten
tonight
landi
though
i
usually
observe
these
things
edith
said
had
a
small
piece
of
vegetable
marrow
and
a
sip
of
claret
are
you
going
to
eat
anything
more
much
more
i
look
forward
to
my
coffee
and
my
cigar
oh
how
i
look
forward
to
it
know
very
well
landi
they
let
you
smoke
cigarettes
between
the
courses
if
you
like
would
be
better
than
nothing
we
see
presently
i
inquire
if
you
live
on
cigars
and
coffee
he
answered
satirically
live
on
eau
sucré
and
porreege
scotch
ca
talk
to
you
if
you
so
silly
tell
me
the
important
part
on
the
little
sofa
upstairs
in
the
salon
he
said
dinner
tonight
here
somehow
the
food
and
the
faces
distract
one
unless
one
is
making
an
acquaintance
i
know
you
too
well
to
talk
at
dinner
true
i
ought
to
take
time
to
think
then
no
hurry
good
heavens
the
man
has
waited
four
years
he
can
wait
another
week
quelle
idée
going
back
said
edith
soon
as
he
well
he
wants
me
to
promise
before
he
goes
he
you
remind
me
of
the
man
who
said
to
his
wife
my
dear
i
off
to
the
thirty
years
war
it
all
right
edith
find
a
solution
i
have
no
fears
she
turned
to
mr
mitchell
the
rest
of
the
evening
passed
pleasantly
alone
with
the
women
madame
frabelle
was
the
centre
of
an
admiring
circle
as
she
lectured
on
and
economy
in
and
how
to
manage
a
house
on
next
to
nothing
a
year
all
the
ladies
gasped
with
admiration
edith
especially
was
impressed
because
the
fact
that
madame
frabelle
was
a
guest
and
was
managing
nothing
did
not
prevent
her
talking
as
if
she
had
any
amount
of
experience
on
the
subject
although
by
her
own
showing
she
had
been
staying
at
hotels
ever
since
the
war
began
except
the
last
weeks
she
had
spent
with
the
ottleys
the
men
soon
joined
them
a
group
of
war
valetudinarians
amongst
whom
bruce
was
not
the
least
emphatic
told
each
other
their
symptoms
in
a
quiet
corner
they
described
their
strange
shiverings
down
the
spine
the
curious
fits
of
hunger
that
came
on
before
meals
the
dislike
to
crossing
the
road
when
there
was
an
accident
the
inability
to
sleep
sometimes
taking
the
form
of
complete
insomnia
for
as
much
as
twenty
minutes
in
the
early
morning
they
pitied
each
other
cordially
though
neither
listened
to
the
symptoms
except
in
exchange
for
sympathy
with
their
own
war
has
got
on
my
nerves
i
ca
think
of
anything
else
bruce
said
an
i
pant
for
the
morning
when
the
due
and
then
i
ca
look
at
it
not
even
a
glance
odd
is
it
the
rev
byrne
fraser
who
gave
his
wife
great
and
constant
anxiety
by
his
fantasies
related
how
he
had
curious
dreams
the
distressing
part
of
which
was
that
they
never
came
true
about
the
death
of
relatives
at
the
front
another
man
also
had
morbid
fancies
on
the
subject
of
the
casualty
list
and
had
had
to
go
and
stay
at
a
farm
so
as
to
right
away
from
it
all
but
he
soon
left
as
he
had
found
to
his
great
disappointment
that
his
companions
there
were
not
intellectual
and
could
not
even
talk
politics
or
discuss
literature
and
yet
they
went
in
or
so
he
had
heard
for
culture
presently
sir
tito
played
his
italian
march
the
musical
portion
of
the
party
and
the
unmusical
alike
joined
in
the
chorus
then
the
party
received
a
welcome
addition
valdez
the
great
composer
who
had
written
many
successful
operas
and
had
lived
so
much
abroad
that
he
cared
now
for
nothing
but
british
music
looked
in
after
a
patriotic
concert
given
in
order
to
help
the
unengaged
professionals
always
loyal
to
old
friends
he
had
deserted
royalty
itself
tonight
to
greet
mitchell
and
was
persuaded
by
adoring
ladies
to
sing
his
celebrated
old
song
several
years
it
pleased
and
thrilled
the
audience
even
more
than
landi
hiver
indeed
tonight
it
was
valdez
who
was
the
success
of
the
evening
ladies
who
had
loved
him
for
years
loved
him
now
more
than
ever
young
girls
who
saw
him
now
for
the
first
time
fell
in
love
just
as
their
mothers
had
done
with
his
splendid
black
eyes
and
commanding
presence
and
secretly
longed
to
stroke
at
least
every
seventh
wave
of
his
abundant
hair
when
edith
assured
him
that
his
curls
were
a
flock
of
goats
on
mount
gilead
he
laughed
declared
he
was
much
flattered
at
the
comparison
and
kissed
her
hand
with
courtly
grace
young
cricker
who
came
because
he
was
asked
insisted
on
dancing
like
nijinsky
because
he
was
begged
not
to
but
his
leaps
and
bounds
were
soon
stopped
by
a
few
subalterns
and
very
young
officers
on
leave
who
insisted
with
some
fair
partners
on
dancing
the
fox
trot
to
the
sound
of
a
gramophone
for
a
few
moments
on
the
little
sofa
edith
managed
to
convey
the
rest
of
her
confidence
to
landi
she
pointed
out
how
hurried
how
urgent
how
pressing
it
was
to
give
an
answer
wants
a
war
elopement
i
see
said
landi
ça
ne
se
fait
pas
what
am
i
to
say
landi
you
know
i
sha
really
ever
it
give
you
pleasure
to
see
him
married
to
the
spanish
girl
not
exactly
spanish
she
only
looks
it
do
laugh
like
that
do
know
why
but
spain
seems
always
to
remind
me
of
something
ridiculous
onions
or
guitars
i
should
mind
her
nearly
so
much
as
anyone
else
do
mind
her
said
landi
savez
ne
pas
what
would
you
dislike
him
to
do
most
think
i
could
bear
anyone
else
to
take
my
place
exactly
admitted
edith
ça
you
do
want
him
to
be
in
love
with
another
married
woman
with
a
husband
like
bruce
well
my
dear
he
wo
there
is
no
other
husband
like
bruce
landi
promised
to
consider
the
question
and
she
arranged
to
go
and
see
him
at
his
studio
before
seeing
aylmer
again
as
they
went
out
of
the
house
miss
coniston
ran
after
madame
frabelle
and
said
eagerly
do
tell
me
again
you
say
à
la
is
marvellously
nourishing
and
economical
i
can
have
it
made
for
my
brother
at
our
flat
course
you
can
it
costs
next
to
nothing
arthur
coniston
came
up
tastes
like
nothing
on
earth
i
suppose
he
grumbled
in
his
sister
ear
ca
give
me
much
less
to
eat
than
you
do
already
arthur
his
sister
said
you
happy
at
home
i
think
a
pessimist
pessimist
cried
mitchell
who
was
following
them
into
the
hall
i
hate
pessimists
what
the
latest
definition
of
them
ah
i
know
an
optimist
is
a
person
who
does
care
what
happens
as
long
as
it
does
happen
to
him
said
edith
quickly
a
pessimist
is
the
person
who
lives
with
the
optimist
dear
i
always
thought
the
old
joke
was
that
an
optimist
looks
after
the
eyes
and
a
pessimist
after
the
feet
cried
madame
frabelle
as
she
fastened
her
cloak
then
he
ought
to
go
to
a
said
mr
mitchell
and
they
left
him
in
roars
of
laughter

dulcie
clay
in
her
neat
uniform
of
grey
and
white
with
the
scarlet
cross
on
the
front
of
her
apron
was
sitting
in
the
room
she
occupied
for
the
moment
in
aylmer
house
in
jermyn
street
it
was
known
as
second
best
bedroom
as
she
was
anxious
not
to
behave
as
if
she
were
a
guest
she
used
it
as
a
kind
of
boudoir
when
she
was
not
in
attendance
it
was
charmingly
furnished
in
the
prim
chippendale
style
a
style
dainty
but
not
luxurious
that
seemed
peculiarly
suited
to
dulcie
she
was
in
the
not
with
her
feet
up
no
cushions
behind
her
unlike
edith
she
was
not
the
kind
of
woman
who
rested
habitually
she
sat
quite
upright
in
the
corner
a
beautiful
little
mahogany
table
was
at
her
right
with
a
small
electric
lamp
on
it
and
two
books
one
of
the
books
was
her
own
choice
the
other
had
been
lent
to
her
by
aylmer
it
was
a
volume
of
bernard
shaw
she
could
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
it
and
the
prefaces
which
she
read
with
the
greatest
avidity
perplexed
her
even
more
than
the
books
themselves
every
now
and
then
a
flash
of
lightning
in
the
form
of
some
phrase
she
knew
illumined
for
a
second
the
darkness
of
the
author
words
but
soon
she
closed
the
thick
volume
with
the
small
print
and
returned
to
daisy
dulcie
was
barely
she
carried
everywhere
in
her
trunk
a
volume
called
wide
wide
she
was
never
weary
of
reading
this
work
with
the
comprehensive
title
it
reminded
her
of
schooldays
it
was
comforting
like
a
and
slippers
like
an
old
friend
whether
she
had
ever
thoroughly
understood
it
may
be
doubted
if
any
modern
person
nowadays
were
to
dip
into
it
he
would
find
it
perhaps
more
obscure
than
george
meredith
at
his
darkest
secretly
dulcie
loved
best
in
the
world
in
the
form
of
reading
matter
the
feuilletons
in
the
daily
papers
there
was
something
so
exciting
in
that
way
they
have
of
stopping
at
a
thrilling
moment
and
leaving
you
the
whole
day
to
think
over
what
would
come
next
and
the
night
to
sleep
over
it
she
preferred
that
she
never
concentrated
her
mind
for
long
on
a
story
or
any
work
of
the
imagination
she
was
deeply
interested
in
her
own
life
she
was
more
subjective
than
objective
though
perhaps
she
had
never
heard
the
words
unconsciously
she
dealt
with
life
only
as
it
related
to
herself
but
this
is
almost
universal
with
young
girls
who
have
only
just
become
conscious
of
themselves
and
of
their
importance
in
the
world
have
only
just
left
the
simple
objectiveness
of
the
child
who
wants
to
look
at
the
world
and
have
barely
begun
to
feel
what
it
is
to
be
an
actor
rather
than
a
spectator
not
that
any
living
being
could
be
less
selfish
or
vain
or
less
of
an
egotist
than
dulcie
if
she
saw
things
chiefly
as
they
were
related
to
herself
it
was
because
this
problem
of
her
life
was
rather
an
intricate
one
her
position
was
not
sufficiently
simple
to
suit
her
simple
nature
her
mother
who
had
been
of
spanish
descent
had
died
young
her
father
had
married
again
he
was
the
sort
of
man
who
always
married
again
and
if
his
present
wife
with
whom
he
was
rather
in
love
had
passed
away
he
would
have
undoubtedly
married
a
third
time
some
men
are
born
husbands
they
have
a
passion
for
domesticity
for
a
fireside
for
a
home
yet
curiously
these
men
very
rarely
stay
at
home
apparently
what
they
want
is
to
have
a
place
to
get
away
from
the
new
stepmother
who
was
young
and
rather
pretty
was
not
unkind
but
was
bored
and
indifferent
to
the
little
girl
dulcie
was
sensitive
since
her
father
second
marriage
she
had
always
felt
in
the
way
whether
her
stepmother
was
being
charming
to
her
husband
or
to
some
other
man
she
was
always
charming
to
somebody
dulcie
felt
continually
that
she
was
not
wanted
her
father
was
kind
and
casual
he
told
everyone
what
he
believed
that
his
second
wife
was
an
ideal
person
to
bring
up
his
little
daughter
therefore
it
came
upon
him
as
a
surprise
when
she
told
him
she
was
grown
up
and
still
more
that
she
wished
to
leave
home
and
be
a
nurse
clay
had
made
no
objection
the
girl
rather
depressed
her
for
she
felt
she
ought
to
like
her
more
than
she
did
so
she
up
with
apparent
good
nature
the
great
desire
to
go
out
and
do
something
dulcie
had
inherited
three
hundred
a
year
from
her
mother
her
father
had
about
the
same
amount
of
his
own
to
live
on
he
believed
that
he
added
to
it
by
mild
gambling
and
perhaps
by
talking
a
good
deal
at
his
club
of
how
he
had
been
born
to
make
a
fortune
but
had
had
no
luck
his
second
wife
had
no
money
dulcie
therefore
was
entirely
independent
no
obstacles
were
placed
in
her
way
the
particular
form
that
her
ambition
took
was
suggested
by
the
war
but
in
any
case
she
would
have
done
something
she
had
taken
the
usual
means
of
getting
into
a
hospital
gentle
industrious
obedient
and
unselfish
she
got
on
well
her
prettiness
gained
her
no
enemies
among
the
women
as
she
was
too
serious
about
her
work
at
this
time
to
make
use
of
her
beauty
by
attracting
men
yet
dulcie
was
unusually
feminine
she
had
a
natural
gift
for
nursing
for
housekeeping
for
domesticity
she
was
not
artistic
and
was
as
indifferent
to
abstractions
and
to
general
ideas
as
the
ideal
average
woman
she
was
tactful
sweet
and
she
had
been
called
at
school
rather
a
doormat
her
appearance
was
distinguished
and
she
was
not
at
all
ordinary
it
is
far
from
ordinary
indeed
it
is
very
rare
to
be
the
ideal
average
woman
she
took
great
interest
in
detail
she
would
lie
awake
at
night
thinking
about
how
she
would
go
the
next
day
to
a
certain
inexpensive
shop
to
get
a
piece
of
ribbon
for
one
part
of
her
dress
to
match
a
piece
of
ribbon
in
another
part
neither
of
which
would
ever
be
seen
by
any
human
being
such
men
as
she
saw
liked
and
admired
her
her
gradual
success
led
her
to
being
sent
abroad
to
a
military
hospital
she
inspired
confidence
not
because
she
had
initiative
but
because
one
knew
she
would
do
exactly
as
she
was
told
which
is
in
itself
a
great
quality
at
boulogne
she
made
the
acquaintance
at
once
of
aylmer
and
of
coup
de
she
worshipped
him
at
first
sight
so
she
thought
herself
fortunate
when
she
was
allowed
to
come
back
to
london
with
him
under
orders
she
continued
her
assiduous
attention
everyone
said
she
was
a
perfect
nurse
occasionally
she
went
to
see
her
father
he
greeted
her
with
warmth
and
affection
and
told
her
all
about
how
on
account
of
racing
being
stopped
he
was
gradually
becoming
a
pauper
when
she
began
telling
him
of
the
events
in
which
she
was
absorbed
he
answered
by
giving
her
news
of
the
prospects
for
the
cambridgeshire
in
the
little
den
in
the
house
in
west
kensington
where
he
lived
she
would
come
in
and
say
in
a
soft
voice
dear
you
know
i
sha
be
able
to
stop
much
longer
longer
where
with
my
patient
mr
ross
mr
aylmer
ross
you
mind
you
my
dear
there
are
two
good
that
are
not
to
be
sneezed
at
he
shook
his
head
solemnly
it
had
never
occurred
to
dulcie
for
a
moment
to
sneeze
at
she
hardly
knew
what
they
were
what
do
you
advise
for
me
papa
dear
child
i
ca
advise
you
ca
select
with
any
approach
to
confidence
between
buttercup
and
beautiful
doll
mind
you
i
very
much
inclined
to
think
that
more
haste
may
win
yet
look
how
he
ran
in
august
when
nobody
knew
anything
about
him
i
know
papa
but
she
gave
it
up
and
see
your
mother
dear
go
and
ask
her
about
it
and
he
returned
to
the
racing
intelligence
strange
that
a
man
who
had
not
enough
to
live
on
should
think
he
could
add
to
his
income
by
backing
losers
still
such
was
mr
clay
view
of
life
besides
he
was
just
going
out
he
was
always
just
going
out
she
would
then
go
and
see
her
stepmother
who
greeted
her
most
affectionately
dulcie
only
kept
half
her
little
income
for
herself
at
present
a
considerable
advantage
to
a
woman
like
mrs
clay
who
declared
she
was
to
dress
up
to
a
certain
standard
though
of
course
simply
during
she
would
kiss
the
girl
and
drag
her
up
to
her
bedroom
to
show
her
a
new
coat
and
skirt
or
send
the
general
servant
up
to
bring
down
the
marvellously
cheap
little
that
had
just
come
home
both
her
parents
it
will
be
seen
were
ready
enough
to
talk
to
her
but
they
were
not
prepared
to
listen
all
the
warmth
and
affection
that
she
had
in
her
nature
very
naturally
was
concentrated
on
her
patient
dulcie
now
sat
in
the
wondering
what
to
do
she
was
sadly
thinking
what
would
happen
when
the
time
came
for
her
to
leave
in
her
mind
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
what
several
people
had
said
was
true
the
profession
she
had
chosen
was
too
arduous
for
her
physical
strength
besides
now
she
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
nursing
anyone
else
after
aylmer
she
was
trying
to
make
up
her
mind
to
take
something
else
and
she
could
not
think
what
a
girl
like
dulcie
clay
who
has
studied
only
one
thing
really
thoroughly
could
be
fitted
only
to
be
a
companion
either
to
children
whom
she
adored
or
to
some
tedious
elderly
lady
with
fads
she
knew
she
would
not
do
for
a
secretary
she
had
not
the
education
nor
the
gift
for
it
the
thought
of
going
back
to
the
stepmother
who
showed
so
clearly
her
satisfaction
and
high
spirits
in
having
got
rid
of
her
and
of
being
again
the
unwanted
third
in
the
little
house
in
west
kensington
was
quite
unbearable
she
had
told
much
of
her
position
to
edith
who
was
so
sympathetic
and
clever
it
would
have
been
a
dream
of
hers
a
secret
dream
to
teach
edith
little
girl
whom
she
had
once
seen
and
loved
yet
that
would
have
been
in
some
ways
rather
difficult
as
she
looked
out
of
the
window
darkened
with
fog
she
sighed
if
she
had
been
the
governess
at
edith
house
she
would
be
constantly
seeing
aylmer
she
knew
of
course
all
about
aylmer
passion
it
would
certainly
be
better
than
nothing
to
see
him
sometimes
but
the
position
would
have
been
painful
also
she
disliked
bruce
he
had
given
her
one
or
two
looks
that
seemed
rather
to
demand
admiration
than
to
express
it
he
had
been
so
kind
as
to
give
her
a
few
hints
on
nursing
how
to
look
after
a
convalescent
and
had
been
exceedingly
frank
and
kind
in
confiding
to
her
his
own
symptoms
as
she
was
a
hospital
nurse
it
seemed
to
him
natural
to
talk
rather
of
his
own
indisposition
than
on
any
other
subject
dulcie
was
rather
highly
strung
and
bruce
got
terribly
on
her
nerves
she
marvelled
at
edith
patience
but
then
edith
no
she
could
not
go
to
the
ottleys
her
other
gift
a
beautiful
soprano
voice
also
was
of
hardly
any
use
to
her
as
she
was
now
placed
when
she
sang
she
expressed
herself
more
completely
than
at
any
other
time
but
that
also
she
had
not
been
taught
thoroughly
she
had
been
taught
nothing
thoroughly
a
companion
though
she
had
not
absolutely
to
earn
her
living
and
kept
only
half
of
her
little
inheritance
for
herself
what
was
to
become
of
her
well
she
would
think
about
it
any
more
that
day
at
any
rate
aylmer
talked
as
though
she
was
to
remain
some
time
longer
when
he
had
returned
suddenly
to
the
house
in
jermyn
street
a
relative
had
hastily
obtained
for
him
the
necessary
servants
his
former
valet
was
at
the
front
they
were
all
new
to
him
and
to
his
ways
and
he
had
no
housekeeper
dulcie
did
the
housekeeping
could
she
take
that
place
in
his
house
no
she
knew
that
she
was
too
young
and
everyone
else
would
have
said
she
was
too
pretty
only
as
a
nurse
would
it
be
correct
for
her
to
be
his
companion
and
from
fear
of
embarrassing
him
she
was
hardly
ever
with
him
alone
she
thought
he
was
abrupt
more
cool
to
her
since
their
return
and
guessed
the
reason
it
was
for
fear
of
compromising
her
how
angelic
of
him
what
a
wonderful
man
how
fortunate
his
first
wife
must
have
been
and
the
boy
teddy
the
charming
boy
so
like
his
father
whom
she
had
only
seen
for
a
day
or
two
before
he
left
to
go
out
teddy
presence
would
help
to
make
it
more
difficult
for
her
to
remain
in
that
very
short
time
the
boy
had
distinctly
shown
her
by
his
marked
attention
how
much
he
admired
her
he
thought
her
lovely
he
was
devoted
to
music
and
she
had
sung
to
him
aylmer
also
liked
music
but
apparently
did
not
care
to
hear
her
sing
on
the
occasion
that
she
did
it
seemed
to
irritate
him
indeed
she
knew
she
was
merely
the
most
amateurish
of
musicians
and
could
just
accompany
herself
in
a
few
songs
though
the
voice
itself
was
a
rare
gift
how
perfect
aylmer
had
been
there
was
a
sharp
ring
she
closed
the
book
turned
out
the
little
electric
lamp
and
went
downstairs
she
was
looking
ideally
pretty
in
the
becoming
uniform
but
uniforms
are
always
becoming
whatever
the
uniforms
or
the
people
may
be
the
reason
of
this
is
too
obscure
to
fathom
one
would
say
that
to
dress
to
suit
oneself
would
be
more
becoming
to
men
and
women
yet
in
fact
the
limitation
and
the
want
of
variety
in
this
sort
of
dress
had
a
singular
attraction
however
if
she
had
chosen
it
to
suit
her
nothing
could
have
been
more
becoming
the
severity
of
the
form
the
dull
colour
relieved
by
the
large
scarlet
cross
showed
off
to
the
greatest
advantage
her
dense
dark
hair
her
face
and
the
slim
yet
not
angular
lines
of
her
figure
dulcie
beauty
was
of
a
kind
that
is
thrown
into
relief
by
excessive
plainness
of
dress
chapter
xix
as
she
came
in
aylmer
looked
at
her
with
more
observation
than
usual
and
he
acknowledged
to
himself
that
she
was
pretty
remarkably
pretty
quite
a
picture
as
people
say
and
he
liked
her
as
one
likes
a
confidante
a
reliable
friend
he
trusted
her
remembering
how
he
had
given
himself
away
to
her
that
dreadful
day
in
the
boulogne
hospital
and
she
had
another
quality
that
pleased
him
immensely
she
was
neither
coquettish
nor
affected
but
simple
and
serious
she
appeared
to
think
solely
of
her
duties
and
in
aylmer
opinion
that
was
just
what
a
nurse
should
do
but
edith
remark
that
dulcie
was
madly
in
love
with
him
had
made
a
certain
impression
on
his
mind
indeed
everything
edith
said
even
a
merely
trivial
observation
was
of
importance
to
aylmer
edith
have
said
that
unless
she
meant
it
if
it
was
true
did
it
matter
aylmer
was
very
free
from
vanity
and
masculine
coquetry
he
had
a
good
deal
of
pride
and
great
like
almost
every
human
being
who
is
superior
to
the
average
he
did
think
ill
of
himself
there
were
things
that
he
was
proud
of
he
was
proud
secretly
of
having
gone
into
the
army
and
of
having
been
wounded
it
made
him
feel
he
was
not
on
the
shelf
not
useless
and
superannuated
he
took
a
certain
pride
also
in
his
judgement
his
excellent
judgement
on
pictures
and
literature
perhaps
even
having
been
a
spoilt
only
child
he
was
privately
proud
of
some
of
his
faults
he
knew
he
was
extravagant
and
impatient
the
best
of
everything
was
barely
good
enough
for
aylmer
long
before
he
inherited
the
property
that
had
come
to
him
a
year
ago
he
had
never
been
the
sort
of
young
man
who
would
manage
on
little
who
would
for
example
go
to
the
gallery
by
underground
or
omnibus
to
see
a
play
or
to
the
opera
he
required
comfort
ease
for
that
reason
he
had
worked
really
hard
at
the
bar
so
as
to
have
enough
money
to
live
according
to
his
ideas
not
that
he
took
any
special
interest
in
the
bar
his
ideal
had
always
been
if
it
could
be
combined
to
be
either
a
soldier
or
a
man
of
leisure
devoted
to
sport
literature
and
art
now
he
had
asserted
himself
as
a
soldier
and
he
meant
to
go
back
but
he
looked
forward
to
leisure
to
enjoy
and
indulge
his
favourite
tastes
if
possible
with
the
only
woman
he
had
ever
been
deeply
in
love
with
he
was
particularly
attractive
to
women
who
liked
his
strong
will
and
depth
of
feeling
his
assertive
manner
and
that
feeling
of
trust
that
he
inspired
women
always
know
when
a
man
will
not
treat
them
badly
teddy
mother
his
first
wife
he
had
really
married
out
of
pity
when
she
died
everyone
regarded
it
as
a
tragedy
except
himself
he
still
worshipped
his
mother
whose
little
miniature
he
kept
always
by
him
and
he
had
always
fancied
that
edith
resembled
her
this
was
simply
an
for
there
was
no
resemblance
his
mother
according
to
the
miniature
had
the
dark
hair
and
innocent
expression
that
were
the
fashion
at
the
time
while
edith
was
fair
with
rather
dark
eyebrows
grey
eyes
and
the
mouth
and
chin
characteristic
of
and
rossetti
pictures
but
though
she
might
be
in
appearance
a
she
was
very
modern
his
favourite
little
photograph
of
her
that
he
had
shown
in
his
moment
of
despair
to
dulcie
showed
a
charming
face
sensuous
yet
thoughtful
under
a
large
hat
she
had
fur
up
to
her
chin
and
was
holding
a
muff
it
was
a
snapshot
taken
the
winter
before
they
had
parted
aylmer
worshipped
these
two
women
his
dead
mother
and
the
living
woman
whom
he
had
never
given
up
entirely
how
unlike
were
both
the
types
to
dulcie
clay
with
her
waved
madonna
hair
dark
skin
large
clear
blue
eyes
softened
by
eyelashes
of
extraordinary
length
her
chin
was
very
small
her
mouth
fine
rather
thin
she
had
a
pathetic
expression
one
could
imagine
her
attending
helping
nursing
holding
a
child
in
her
arms
but
not
his
intellectual
equal
guiding
and
directing
like
his
mother
and
without
the
social
brilliance
and
charm
of
edith
seeing
him
looking
at
her
with
a
long
observant
look
dulcie
became
nervous
and
trembled
slightly
she
waited
for
him
to
speak
here
miss
clay
i
want
to
speak
to
you
instantly
she
sat
down
by
him
wanted
to
say
you
been
most
awfully
kind
to
me
dulcie
murmured
something
nearly
well
now
are
i
wood
says
you
can
go
out
driving
next
week
but
i
do
mean
that
i
mean
i
well
in
myself
he
spoke
quickly
almost
impatiently
doctor
says
you
still
suffering
from
nervous
shock
she
answered
in
a
toneless
voice
professionally
very
soon
i
sha
need
any
attendance
that
a
valet
or
a
housekeeper
could
give
me
shall
i
i
suppose
not
my
dear
miss
clay
of
course
i
shall
hate
you
to
go
he
said
politely
do
you
think
we
ought
to
be
thinking
he
stopped
she
answered
course
i
go
whenever
you
and
dr
wood
think
it
right
see
he
went
on
know
i
shall
need
a
housekeeper
especially
when
teddy
comes
back
he
coming
back
on
leave
next
week
aylmer
glanced
at
the
telegram
in
his
hand
well
do
think
i
could
course
you
would
make
a
splendid
housekeeper
he
laughed
are
already
but
she
did
wish
to
make
him
uncomfortable
evidently
he
was
thinking
what
she
knew
herself
but
she
was
so
reluctant
to
go
you
think
i
could
remain
here
for
a
little
while
she
said
modestly
do
the
housekeeping
and
be
useful
you
see
i
nowhere
to
go
really
my
dear
girl
excuse
me
do
you
see
you
rather
too
young
it
would
be
selfish
of
me
to
let
you
he
wished
to
say
that
it
would
be
compromising
but
a
certain
consciousness
prevented
his
saying
it
he
felt
he
would
be
ridiculous
if
he
put
it
into
words
as
you
like
how
soon
do
you
think
i
ought
to
go
though
she
tried
not
to
show
it
there
was
a
look
almost
of
despair
in
her
face
her
eyes
looked
startled
as
if
trying
not
to
shed
tears
he
was
very
sorry
for
her
but
tried
to
hide
it
by
a
cool
and
impatient
manner
shall
we
say
in
about
a
fortnight
she
looked
down
shall
miss
you
awfully
he
said
speaking
more
quickly
than
usual
to
get
it
over
she
gave
a
very
small
smile
and
then
may
i
ask
what
you
thinking
of
doing
next
was
just
what
i
was
thinking
about
she
answered
rather
naïvely
are
so
few
things
i
can
do
then
fearing
this
sentence
sounded
like
begging
to
remain
she
hastily
added
of
course
if
i
do
go
home
i
might
be
a
companion
or
look
after
children
wonder
if
mrs
ottley
began
aylmer
has
a
dear
little
girl
and
i
heard
her
say
she
would
soon
want
someone
said
dulcie
with
a
slight
smile
dilly
there
was
a
moment
of
intense
awkwardness
between
them
then
dulcie
said
afraid
that
would
quite
do
i
not
clever
enough
rot
you
know
enough
for
a
child
like
that
i
shall
speak
to
mrs
ottley
about
it
very
very
kind
of
you
but
i
would
rather
not
i
think
i
shall
try
to
be
a
companion
the
name
of
that
woman
aylmer
said
irish
woman
wife
of
one
of
the
cabinet
ministers
who
came
to
the
hospital
at
boulogne
and
wanted
to
have
lessons
conroy
dulcie
answered
lady
conroy
supposing
that
she
needed
a
secretary
or
companion
would
you
dislike
that
no
i
should
like
it
very
much
i
get
mrs
ottley
to
speak
to
her
about
it
she
said
she
was
coming
to
london
did
she
i
got
to
know
her
fairly
well
said
dulcie
very
charming
celebrated
for
her
bad
memory
aylmer
said
with
a
smile
declares
she
forgets
her
own
name
sometimes
once
she
got
into
a
taxi
and
told
the
man
to
drive
home
when
he
asked
where
that
was
she
said
it
was
his
business
to
know
she
had
forgotten
her
address
they
both
laughed
go
tomorrow
said
dulcie
see
my
stepmother
if
you
want
me
in
the
afternoon
or
perhaps
the
day
you
go
for
a
drive
would
be
better
me
miss
clay
are
you
happy
at
home
it
is
that
they
do
want
me
i
in
the
way
you
see
got
used
to
my
being
out
of
the
house
excuse
me
you
do
earn
your
own
living
really
that
is
really
necessary
but
i
do
want
to
live
at
home
her
face
showed
such
a
decided
distaste
to
the
idea
that
he
said
no
more
looking
very
well
today
dulcie
said
he
sighed
feel
rather
rotten
i
ca
read
ca
settle
to
anything
she
looked
at
him
sympathetically
he
felt
impelled
to
go
on
a
bit
worried
he
continued
your
son
not
about
him
so
much
though
i
wish
he
would
get
a
flesh
wound
and
be
sent
back
his
father
said
laughing
about
myself
she
looked
at
him
in
silence
know
what
i
told
you
she
made
no
answer
looking
away
to
give
him
time
to
speak
made
a
suggestion
he
said
slowly
it
accepted
alter
all
my
life
of
course
i
shall
go
out
again
but
still
it
will
alter
my
life
suddenly
overpowered
by
the
longing
for
sympathy
he
said
to
himself
aloud
wonder
if
there
a
chance
do
know
what
it
is
she
murmured
but
instinctively
she
had
guessed
something
of
it
do
want
to
think
about
it
any
more
at
present
i
read
to
you
do
she
quietly
arranged
a
pillow
behind
him
and
took
up
a
newspaper
he
often
liked
her
to
read
to
him
he
never
listened
to
a
word
of
it
but
it
was
soothing
she
had
taken
up
morning
gossip
from
daily
and
she
began
in
the
soft
low
distinct
voice
reading
from
the
rambler
redesdale
says
that
when
lord
haldane
scheme
for
a
territorial
army
was
on
foot
he
took
it
to
the
aylmer
stopped
her
not
i
read
you
a
novel
think
i
should
like
to
hear
some
poetry
today
he
answered
she
had
taken
up
a
pretty
tiny
little
book
that
lay
on
his
table
called
of
the
and
began
to
read
aloud
is
my
only
joy
faithless
as
the
winds
or
seas
sometimes
cunning
sometimes
coy
yet
she
never
fails
to
please
stop
aylmer
cried
she
looked
up
tinkles
like
an
try
another
would
you
like
she
asked
smiling
he
took
up
a
french
book
and
passed
it
to
her
think
i
very
changeable
but
i
should
like
this
read
me
the
beginning
of
and
she
began
he
listened
with
his
eyes
closed
lulled
by
the
curious
technique
with
its
constant
repetitions
and
jewelled
style
charmed
altogether
she
read
french
fluently
enough
delightful
he
said
but
he
soon
noticed
she
was
stumbling
over
the
words
no
it
was
not
suitable
for
her
to
read
he
was
obstinate
however
and
was
determined
she
should
read
him
something
so
they
fell
back
on
chapter
xx
lady
conroy
had
arrived
home
in
carlton
house
terrace
complaining
of
a
headache
she
remained
on
the
sofa
in
her
for
about
five
minutes
during
which
time
she
believed
she
had
been
dozing
in
reality
she
had
been
looking
for
her
glasses
dropping
her
bag
and
ringing
the
bell
to
send
a
servant
for
a
handkerchief
she
was
a
handsome
woman
of
with
black
hair
turning
a
little
grey
grey
irish
eyes
and
a
wonderfully
brilliant
complexion
she
must
have
been
a
remarkably
girl
but
now
to
her
great
vexation
she
was
growing
a
little
too
fat
she
varied
between
treatments
which
she
scarcely
began
before
she
forgot
them
and
utter
indifference
to
her
appearance
when
she
declared
she
was
much
happier
letting
herself
go
in
loose
gowns
and
eating
everything
of
which
she
had
deprived
herself
for
a
day
or
two
for
the
sake
of
her
figure
lady
conroy
had
often
compared
herself
to
the
old
woman
who
lived
in
a
shoe
because
of
her
large
family
her
friends
declared
she
remember
how
many
children
she
had
she
loved
them
but
there
were
certainly
weeks
when
she
did
see
the
younger
ones
for
she
was
constantly
absorbed
in
various
different
subjects
besides
she
spent
most
of
her
life
in
looking
for
things
she
was
hopelessly
careless
and
had
no
memory
at
all
suddenly
she
glanced
at
the
watch
on
her
wrist
compared
it
with
the
splendid
empire
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
and
went
with
a
bewildered
look
to
the
telephone
on
her
having
gone
through
a
considerable
amount
of
torture
by
calling
up
the
wrong
number
and
absently
ringing
off
as
soon
as
she
had
got
the
right
one
she
at
last
found
herself
talking
to
edith
is
that
you

lucky
to
catch
you

as
she
waited
for
her
visitor
lady
conroy
walked
round
the
room
nearly
everything
on
which
she
cast
her
eye
reminded
her
of
a
different
train
of
thought
so
that
by
the
time
edith
was
announced
by
the
footman
she
had
forgotten
what
she
wanted

lady

blank
she
frowned
slightly
and
a
vague
look
came
into
her
eyes
the
pathetic
look
of
someone
who
is
trying
to
remember
a
minute

conroy
called
out
tell
the
cook
it
does
matter
i
wo
have
them
today
madame
edith
was
already
in
a
somewhat
hilarious
mood
lady
conroy
irritate
her
she
amused
her
almost
more
than
any
friend
she
had
besides
once
she
could
be
got
to
concentrate
on
any
one
subject
nobody
was
more
entertaining
edith
english
humour
delighted
in
her
irish
wit
there
was
something
singularly
irish
in
the
way
lady
conroy
managed
to
make
a
kind
of
muddle
and
untidiness
all
round
her
when
she
had
been
in
a
room
a
minute
or
two
when
she
had
entered
the
room
it
was
a
apartment
rather
sparsely
furnished
with
very
little
in
it
all
severest
first
empire
style
there
were
a
few
old
portraits
on
striped
pale
green
walls
and
one
large
basket
of
flowers
on
a
small
table
yet
since
her
entrance
the
room
already
looked
as
if
several
people
had
been
spending
the
week
in
it
without
tidying
it
up
almost
mechanically
edith
picked
up
her
bag
books
newspaper
cigarettes
and
the
glasses
then
you
do
think
madame
frabelle
would
do
said
lady
conroy
dear
lady
conroy
madame
frabelle
would
dream
of
going
as
a
companion
or
secretary

want
a
young
girl
she
about
fifteen
years
older
than
you
are
and
she
staying
with
me
as
my
guest
i
even
suggest
such
a
thing
not
it
would
be
at
all
a
hard
place

she
does
want
a
place
she
very
well
off
remember
heavens

ca
have
much
to
do
then
if
she
only
staying
with
you
said
lady
conroy
she
has
plenty
of
engagements

i
should
advise
madame
frabelle
but
i
do
know
of
someone
you
oh

edith
how
sweet
of
you
oh
just
ring
the
bell
for
me

maid
and
tell
her
to

some
muffins
for

i
forgot
to
tell
the
cook

interrupting
me
like
this

after
all
lady
conroy
leant
back
against
her
cushions
and
with
a
sigh
went
on
see
i
in
the
most
terrible
muddle
dear
edith
i
do
know
where
to
turn
she
turned
to
her
and
opened
it
at
this
now
she
said
rather
triumphantly

all
about
my
war
work

no
it
is
it
an
advertisement
from
a
gracious
ought
i
to
keep
it

you
think
no
i
do
think
i
need
she
folded
it
up
and
put
it
carefully
away
again
you
think
yourself
i
need
someone
i
do
i
think
it
would
be
very
convenient
for
you
to
have
a
nice
girl
with
a
good
memory
to
keep
your
things
in
order
it
cried
lady
conroy
delighted
as
she
lit
a
cigarette
it
someone
who
will
prevent
me
dropping
cigarette
ash
all
over
the
room
and
remember
my
engagements
and
help
me
with
my
war
work
and
write
my
letters
and
do
the
telephoning
that
all
i
shall
want
of
course
if
she
could
do
a
little
needlework
no
no
that
would
do
you
could
expect
her
to
do
brainwork
as
well
as
needlework
edith
broke
in
you
remember
mentioning
to
me
a
girl
you
met
at
boulogne
a
nurse
called
dulcie
clay

answered
lady
conroy
puffing
away
at
her
cigarette
and
obviously
not
speaking
the
truth
edith
laughed
my
dear

but
it
does
matter
well
this
girl
has
been
nursing
mr

with

pouring

into
the
sugar
basin
looking
up

great
kindness

lady
conroy

to
the
door
into
the
hall
pouring
forth
questions
sympathy
and
cheerful
communications
about
the
charming
young
man
in
the
black
watch
just
before
edith
escaped
her
friend
said
by
the
by
i
meant
to
ask
you
something
who
is
madame
frabelle
chapter
xxi
sir
tito
lived
in
a
flat
in
mayfair
on
the
second
floor
of
a
large
corner
house
on
the
ground
floor
was
his
studio
which
had
two
entrances
the
studio
was
a
large
square
white
room
containing
a
little
platform
for
pupils
a
narrow
shelf
ran
all
the
way
round
the
dado
this
shelf
was
entirely
filled
with
the
most
charming
collection
of
english
and
french
china
little
cottages
birds
and
figures
above
the
shelf
was
a
which
again
was
filled
all
the
way
round
with
signed
photographs
of
friends
everything
in
the
room
was
white
even
the
piano
was
white
and
the
furniture
extremely
luxurious
and
comfortable
was
in
colour
a
pale
and
yet
dull
pink
a
curtain
separated
it
from
another
smaller
room
which
again
had
a
separate
entrance
into
the
hall
on
the
left
and
through
a
very
small
led
into
the
street
on
the
right
side
sir
tito
was
waiting
for
edith
spick
span
and
debonair
as
always
although
during
the
war
he
had
discarded
his
buttonhole
he
was
occupied
as
he
usually
was
in
his
leisure
time
not
in
playing
the
piano
or
composing
but
in
making
photograph
frames
this
was
his
hobby
and
people
often
said
that
he
took
more
pleasure
in
the
carving
cutting
out
gumming
and
sticking
together
of
these
objects
than
in
composing
the
melodies
that
were
known
and
loved
all
over
the
world
as
soon
as
edith
came
in
he
showed
her
a
tiny
frame
carved
with
rosebuds
he
said
his
eyes
beaming
mignon
on
dirait
un
petit
coeur
ravissante
hein
he
gazed
at
it
lovingly
sweet
said
edith
laughing
is
it
for
it
for
your
dilly
i
cut
out
a
photograph
of
hers
in
the
shape
of
a
heart
gentil
ce
pas
he
showed
it
to
her
with
childish
pleasure
then
he
put
all
traces
of
the
work
carefully
away
in
a
drawer
and
drew
edith
near
to
the
fire
just
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
give
you
said
sir
tito
suddenly
turning
into
a
serious
man
of
business
and
indeed
he
always
had
many
appointments
not
a
few
of
which
were
on
some
subject
connected
with
love
affairs
like
aylmer
but
in
a
different
way
sir
tito
was
always
being
consulted
but
oddly
enough
while
it
was
the
parents
and
guardians
usually
who
went
to
aylmer
husbands
worried
about
their
wives
mothers
about
their
children
to
the
older
man
it
was
more
frequently
the
culprit
or
the
confidant
himself
or
herself
who
came
to
confide
and
ask
for
help
and
advice
edith
said
dreadful
thing
i
to
tell
you
landi
is
that
i
completely
changed
i
in
love
with
him
all
over
again
vrai
i
do
know
how
and
i
do
know
why
when
he
first
made
that
suggestion
it
seemed
wild
impossible
but
the
things
he
said
how
absolutely
true
it
is
landi
my
life
been
wasted
utterly
wasted
landi
said
nothing
believe
i
was
deceiving
myself
she
went
on
got
so
accustomed
to
living
this
sort
of
half
life
i
become
almost
as
you
would
say
i
did
realise
how
much
i
cared
for
him
now
i
know
i
always
adored
him
you
were
quite
contented
i
made
myself
so
because
i
resolved
to
be
satisfied
but
after
all
there
something
in
what
he
says
landi
my
life
with
bruce
is
only
a
makeshift
nothing
but
tact
tact
tact
oh
i
so
tired
of
tact
she
sighed
seems
to
me
now
really
too
hard
that
i
should
again
have
such
a
great
opportunity
and
should
throw
it
away
you
see
it
is
an
opportunity
if
i
love
him
and
i
not
deceiving
myself
now
i
in
love
with
him
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
more
lovely
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
an
ideal
life
landi
he
was
still
silent
she
continued
see
aylmer
knows
so
well
how
much
the
children
are
to
me
and
he
would
never
ask
me
to
leave
them
there
no
question
of
my
ever
leaving
them
and
bruce
would
mind
bruce
would
be
only
too
thankful
for
me
to
take
them
and
there
another
thing
though
i
despised
the
idea
at
the
time
there
a
good
deal
in
it
i
mean
that
aylmer
well
off
so
i
should
never
be
a
burden
he
would
love
to
take
the
responsibility
of
us
all
i
would
leave
my
income
to
bruce
he
would
be
quite
comfortable
and
independent
oh
he
would
take
it
he
might
be
a
little
cross
but
it
would
last
landi
he
would
be
better
off
he
find
somebody
someone
who
would
look
after
him
perhaps
and
make
him
quite
happy
and
comfortable
you
shocked
ne
pas
it
the
reaction
said
landi
nodding
wonderful
of
you
to
understand
i
have
seen
him
again
you
know
i
just
been
thinking
in
fact
i
surprised
at
myself
but
the
more
i
reflect
on
what
he
said
the
more
wonderful
it
seems
think
how
he
cared
for
me
all
this
time
doute
you
know
that
he
adores
you
but
edith
it
all
very
well
you
put
like
that
but
could
you
go
through
with
it
believe
i
could
now
she
answered
begin
to
long
to
you
see
i
mistook
my
own
feelings
landi
they
seemed
dulled
i
thought
i
could
live
without
love
but
why
should
i
what
is
it
that
made
me
change
so
why
do
i
feel
so
frightened
now
at
the
idea
of
losing
my
happiness
la
guerre
said
sir
tito
war
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
unconsciously
it
affects
people
though
you
yourself
are
not
fighting
aylmer
has
risked
his
life
and
is
going
to
risk
it
again
this
impresses
you
to
many
temperaments
things
seem
to
matter
less
just
now
people
are
reckless
it
that
asked
edith
it
is
but
i
was
so
completely
deceived
in
myself
always
knew
you
could
be
in
love
with
him
said
landi
wait
a
moment
edith
need
the
remedy
be
so
violent
i
do
ask
you
to
live
without
love
why
should
a
woman
live
without
the
very
thing
she
was
created
for
but
you
know
you
hate
publicity
vulgar
scandal
nobody
loathes
it
as
you
do
does
seem
to
matter
now
so
much
edith
said
the
war
whatever
the
cause
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
i
beginning
to
think
i
shall
do
it
i
want
to
i
ca
bear
to
refuse
again
i
have
seen
him
since
our
talk
i
changed
gradually
alone
just
thinking
and
then
you
say
people
have
love
in
their
lives
without
a
violent
public
scandal
he
repeated
i
know
i
understand
what
you
mean
but
i
hate
deceit
landi
i
do
think
i
could
lead
a
double
life
and
even
if
i
would
he
would
she
spoke
rather
proudly
garçon
said
sir
tito
do
i
said
edith
not
a
man
who
could
shake
hands
with
bruce
and
be
friends
and
deceive
him
and
you
know
before
when
i
begged
him
to
remain
my
friend
he
simply
would
he
always
said
he
despised
the
man
who
would
accept
the
part
of
a
tame
cat
and
he
does
believe
in
platonic
friendship
aylmer
too
honest
too
for
that
edith
oh
remember
before
said
landi
taking
her
hand
when
bruce
ran
away
with
another
woman
you
could
bear
the
idea
of
divorce
know
but
i
may
have
been
wrong
besides
i
did
care
for
him
as
i
do
now
and
i
older
now
this
rather
sudden
my
dear
because
i
let
myself
go
let
myself
be
natural
oh
encourage
me
give
me
strength
landi
do
let
me
be
a
coward
think
if
aylmer
goes
out
again
and
is
killed
how
miserable
i
should
feel
to
have
refused
him
and
disappointed
him
for
the
second
time
a
moment
edith
suppose
as
you
say
he
goes
out
again
and
is
killed
and
you
disappointed
him
what
would
your
position
be
then
she
could
answer
is
it
your
conscientiousness
with
regard
to
bruce
does
come
in
the
way
now
why
would
it
ruin
him
less
now
than
formerly
does
seem
to
matter
so
much
he
is
fighting
asked
sir
tito
no
landi
i
never
thought
of
that
but
you
know
he
always
imagines
himself
ill
and
he
quite
all
right
really
he
enjoy
his
grievance
i
he
wo
be
unhappy
and
he
older
and
he
not
tied
to
that
silly
mad
girl
he
ran
away
with
and
besides
i
older
this
is
probably
last
chance
she
looked
at
landi
imploringly
as
if
begging
his
permission
he
answered
calmly
chérie
when
do
you
see
him
again
to
take
him
for
a
drive
tomorrow
dear
edith
promise
me
one
thing
do
undertake
anything
yet
why
not
must
this
may
be
merely
an
impulse
you
may
change
again
it
may
be
a
passing
mood
do
think
it
is
said
edith
it
my
wish
at
present
it
the
result
of
thinking
remember
not
of
his
persuasion
for
a
drive
but
give
him
no
hope
yet
he
took
both
her
hands
no
promise
except
to
me
do
i
know
you
well
i
doubt
if
you
could
do
it
i
could
i
could
go
through
if
i
were
determined
and
if
i
had
the
children
safe
mind
that
for
the
present
live
for
the
day
will
you
promise
me
that
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
he
said
dear
it
too
serious
to
be
impulsive
about
take
time
well
landi
i
promise
you
that
we
meet
again
afterwards
and
talk
it
over
i
come
and
see
you
well
and
must
i
tell
him
anything
not
make
him
a
little
bit
happy
him
nothing
be
nice
to
him
enjoy
your
drive
put
off
all
decision
at
present
he
looked
at
her
her
eyes
were
sparkling
her
colour
her
expression
were
deepened
she
looked
all
animation
with
more
life
than
he
had
ever
seen
in
her
somehow
the
sight
made
his
heart
ache
a
little
a
very
little
poor
girl
of
course
she
had
been
starving
for
love
and
hidden
the
longing
under
domestic
interests
artistic
social
but
human
but
she
deserved
real
love
a
real
lover
she
was
so
loyal
so
true
herself
you
look
like
a
lamp
that
has
been
lighted
said
sir
tito
chuckling
a
little
to
himself
bien
and
the
pretty
nurse
does
she
still
dance
the
cachuca
i
know
i
but
impossible
for
me
not
to
associate
everything
spanish
with
the
ridiculous
i
think
of
guitars
mantillas
sombreros
or
what
else
is
it
ah
i
know
onions
is
even
spanish
really
why
did
you
deceive
me
said
landi
a
shade
absently
with
a
glance
at
his
watch
and
another
in
the
mirror
ca
remain
with
aylmer
she
knows
it
herself
i
trying
to
arrange
for
her
to
become
a
companion
for
lady
conroy
he
laughed
are
more
particular
about
her
being
chaperoned
than
you
were
last
week
aylmer
will
never
care
for
her
she
a
dear
but
he
wo
ne
pas
revu
lui
aylmer
but
he
written
to
me
for
heaven
sake
my
child
burn
the
letters
i
daresay
it
be
difficult
they
are
probably
all
flames
already
did
have
one
lovely
letter
said
edith
she
took
it
out
of
her
dress
he
glanced
at
it
dieu
to
think
that
a
pupil
of
mine
drives
about
in
a
with
compromising
letters
in
her
pocket
non
tu
est
folle
véritablement
edith
to
please
him
she
threw
it
into
the
fire
after
tearing
a
small
blank
piece
of
the
paper
off
and
putting
this
scrap
back
in
the
bodice
of
her
dress
as
she
hurried
away
she
again
promised
him
not
to
undertake
anything
nor
to
allow
aylmer
to
overpower
her
prudent
intention
during
their
drive
time
do
you
start
i
think
i
shall
come
too
said
sir
tito
pretending
to
look
at
his
he
burst
out
laughing
at
her
expression
i
not
wanted
tiens
if
you
not
very
careful
person
will
go
with
you
i
can
tell
you
and
that
will
be
madame
frabelle
she
wo
indeed
not
it
the
last
day
of
archie
holidays
coming
with
you
the
front
seat
with
the
chauffeur
said
edith
there
was
a
ring
at
the
bell
he
lifted
the
curtain
and
caressingly
but
firmly
pushed
her
through
into
the
other
room
sir
tito
had
another
appointment
chapter
xxii
while
this
drama
was
taking
place
in
the
little
house
in
sloane
street
madame
frabelle
who
lived
for
romance
and
was
always
imagining
it
where
it
did
exist
was
of
course
sublimely
unconscious
of
its
presence
she
had
grown
tired
of
her
fancy
about
edith
and
mr
mitchell
or
she
made
herself
believe
that
her
influence
had
stopped
it
but
she
was
beginning
to
think
much
as
she
enjoyed
her
visit
and
delighted
in
her
surroundings
that
it
was
almost
time
for
her
at
least
to
going
away
she
had
made
edith
friends
her
own
she
was
devoted
to
edith
fonder
of
the
children
than
anyone
except
their
grandmother
and
strangely
considering
she
was
a
visitor
who
gave
trouble
she
was
adored
by
the
servants
and
by
everyone
in
the
house
with
the
single
exception
of
archie
she
was
carrying
on
a
kind
of
flirtation
with
the
rev
byrne
fraser
who
was
gradually
succeeding
in
making
her
very
high
church
sometimes
she
rose
early
and
left
the
house
mysteriously
she
went
to
mass
there
was
a
dreamy
expression
in
her
eyes
when
she
came
back
a
slight
perfume
of
incense
instead
of
the
lavender
water
that
she
formerly
affected
was
now
observable
about
her
she
went
to
see
the
group
and
the
english
with
young
coniston
who
explained
to
her
all
he
had
learnt
from
aylmer
a
little
wrong
while
she
assured
him
that
she
knew
nothing
about
pictures
but
she
knew
what
she
liked
she
bought
from
miss
coniston
and
showed
her
how
to
cook
macaroni
and
how
to
make
cheap
but
unpalatable
soup
for
her
brother
and
she
went
to
all
the
war
concerts
and
bazaars
got
up
by
valdez
to
meetings
for
the
serbians
arranged
by
mrs
mitchell
and
to
lady
knitting
society
for
the
refugees
she
was
a
very
busy
woman
but
it
was
not
these
employments
that
were
filling
her
mind
as
she
sat
in
her
own
room
looking
seriously
at
herself
in
the
glass
something
made
her
a
little
preoccupied
she
was
beginning
to
fear
that
bruce
was
getting
too
fond
of
her
the
moment
the
idea
occurred
to
her
it
occurred
to
bruce
also
she
had
a
hypnotic
effect
on
him
as
soon
as
she
thought
of
anything
he
thought
of
it
too
something
in
her
slight
change
of
manner
her
cautious
way
of
answering
and
of
rustling
out
of
the
room
when
they
were
left
alone
together
had
this
effect
bruce
was
enchanted
madame
frabelle
thought
he
was
getting
too
fond
of
her
then
he
must
be
perhaps
he
was
he
certainly
did
like
the
idea
at
all
of
her
going
away
and
changed
the
subject
directly
she
mentioned
it
he
had
always
thought
her
a
very
wonderful
person
he
was
immensely
impressed
by
her
universal
knowledge
and
agreeable
manners
and
general
charm
still
madame
frabelle
was
fifteen
years
older
than
bruce
and
bruce
himself
was
no
chicken
although
he
was
under
forty
his
ideal
of
himself
was
that
he
liked
only
very
young
girls
this
was
not
true
but
as
he
thought
it
was
it
became
very
much
the
same
thing
as
a
matter
of
fact
only
rather
foolish
girls
were
flattered
at
attentions
from
bruce
married
women
preferred
spirited
bachelors
and
attractive
girls
preferred
attractive
boys
in
fact
bruce
was
not
wanted
socially
and
he
felt
a
little
bit
out
of
it
among
the
men
through
not
being
among
the
fighters
the
fact
that
he
told
everyone
that
he
was
not
in
khaki
because
he
was
in
consumption
did
seem
to
make
him
more
interesting
to
the
general
public
his
neurotic
heart
bored
his
friends
at
the
club
in
fact
there
was
not
a
woman
even
his
mother
except
madame
frabelle
who
cared
to
listen
to
his
symptoms
that
she
did
so
and
with
sympathy
was
one
of
her
attractions
but
as
long
as
she
had
listened
to
them
in
a
sisterly
friendly
way
he
regarded
her
only
as
a
friend
a
friend
of
whom
he
was
very
proud
and
whom
he
respected
immensely
as
has
been
said
she
impressed
him
so
much
that
he
did
not
know
she
bored
him
when
she
began
rustling
out
of
the
room
when
they
were
left
alone
and
looking
away
avoiding
his
eye
when
he
stared
at
her
absently
things
were
different
and
he
began
to
feel
rather
flattered
of
course
it
would
be
an
infernal
shame
and
not
the
act
of
a
gentleman
to
take
advantage
of
one
position
as
a
host
by
making
love
to
a
fascinating
guest
but
there
was
so
much
sympathy
between
them
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
the
idea
would
never
have
occurred
to
bruce
unless
it
had
first
occurred
to
madame
frabelle
if
a
woman
in
violet
velvet
leaves
the
room
five
minutes
after
she
left
alone
with
one
even
though
she
has
grey
hair
it
naturally
shows
that
she
thinks
one
is
dangerous
the
result
of
it
all
was
that
when
bruce
heard
edith
was
taking
aylmer
for
a
drive
he
apologised
very
much
indeed
for
not
going
with
her
he
said
frankly
much
as
he
liked
aylmer
wounded
heroes
were
rather
a
bore
he
hoped
aylmer
would
forgive
him
and
madame
frabelle
had
promised
to
take
him
to
the
oratory
she
disapproved
of
his
fancy
of
becoming
a
catholic
she
was
not
one
herself
though
she
was
extremely
high
and
growing
daily
higher
but
the
music
at
the
oratory
on
that
particular
day
was
very
wonderful
and
they
agreed
to
go
there
and
afterwards
well
afterwards
they
might
stroll
home
or
go
and
have
tea
in
bond
street
it
was
the
last
day
of
archie
holidays
and
though
it
was
rather
cold
his
mother
insisted
on
taking
him
with
her
aylmer
tried
to
hide
the
shade
that
came
over
his
face
when
he
saw
the
boy
but
remembering
that
he
had
undertaken
to
be
a
father
to
him
he
cheered
up
as
soon
as
archie
was
settled
it
was
a
lovely
autumn
day
one
of
those
warm
days
that
resemble
early
spring
there
is
the
same
suggestion
of
warmer
sunshine
yet
to
come
the
air
has
a
scent
as
of
growing
things
the
kind
of
muffled
hopes
and
suppressed
excitement
of
april
is
in
the
deceptive
air
this
sort
of
day
is
dangerous
to
charming
people
not
in
their
very
first
youth
in
high
spirits
and
beyond
the
speed
limit
they
started
for
richmond
chapter
xxiii
a
week
later
aylmer
and
his
son
were
sitting
looking
at
each
other
in
the
old
brown
library
teddy
had
come
over
for
ten
days
leave
from
somewhere
in
france
everyone
except
his
father
was
astonished
how
little
he
had
changed
he
seemed
exactly
the
same
although
he
had
gone
through
strange
experiences
but
aylmer
saw
a
different
look
in
his
eyes
he
looked
well
and
brisk
perhaps
a
little
more
developed
and
more
manly
his
shoulders
always
rather
thick
and
broad
seemed
even
broader
although
he
was
thinner
but
it
was
the
expression
of
the
eyes
that
had
altered
those
eyes
had
in
colour
pale
blue
they
had
a
slightly
strained
look
they
seemed
paler
his
sunburn
increased
his
resemblance
to
his
father
always
very
striking
both
had
large
foreheads
clearly
cut
features
and
square
chins
aylmer
was
strictly
speaking
handsomer
his
features
more
refined
more
chiselled
but
teddy
had
the
additional
charm
of
extreme
youth
youth
with
the
and
ease
that
seemed
as
it
were
a
copy
as
his
voice
was
an
echo
of
his
father
the
difference
was
in
culture
and
experience
teddy
had
gone
out
when
he
was
just
on
the
point
of
going
to
balliol
yet
seemed
to
have
something
of
the
oxford
manner
characteristic
of
his
father
a
manner
suave
amiable
a
little
ironical
he
had
the
unmistakable
look
and
his
training
had
immensely
improved
his
appearance
aylmer
was
disappointed
that
the
very
first
thing
his
son
insisted
on
doing
was
to
put
on
evening
clothes
and
go
to
the
empire
that
was
where
the
difference
in
age
told
aylmer
would
not
have
gone
to
the
empire
fresh
from
the
fighting
line
he
made
no
objection
and
concealed
the
tiniest
ache
that
he
felt
when
teddy
went
out
at
once
with
major
willis
an
elder
friend
of
his
quite
as
old
aylmer
thought
to
himself
as
was
but
not
being
a
relative
he
seemed
of
the
same
generation
the
next
evening
teddy
spent
at
home
and
sat
with
his
father
who
declared
himself
to
be
completely
recovered
but
was
still
not
allowed
to
put
his
foot
to
the
ground
miss
clay
was
asked
to
sing
to
them
her
voice
as
has
been
said
was
a
very
beautiful
one
a
clear
fine
soprano
with
a
timbre
rare
in
quality
and
naturally
thrilling
she
had
not
been
taught
well
enough
to
be
a
public
success
perhaps
but
was
much
more
accomplished
than
the
average
amateur
teddy
delighted
in
it
she
sang
all
the
popular
songs
she
had
a
way
that
was
almost
humorous
of
putting
refinement
into
the
stupidest
and
vulgarest
melody
and
then
she
sang
some
of
those
technically
poor
but
attaching
melodies
that
sung
in
a
certain
way
without
sickening
sentimentality
or
affectation
seem
to
search
one
soul
and
bring
out
all
that
there
is
in
one
of
romance
she
looked
very
beautiful
that
aylmer
admitted
to
himself
and
she
sang
simply
and
charmingly
that
he
owned
also
why
did
it
irritate
him
so
intensely
to
see
teddy
moved
and
thrilled
to
see
his
eyes
brighten
his
colour
rise
and
to
see
him
obviously
admiring
the
girl
when
she
made
an
excuse
to
leave
them
teddy
was
evidently
quite
disappointed
the
next
day
aylmer
limped
down
to
the
library
to
his
great
surprise
he
heard
voices
in
the
room
dulcie
used
for
her
he
heard
teddy
begging
her
to
sing
to
him
again
he
heard
her
refuse
and
then
teddy
voice
asking
her
to
go
out
to
tea
with
him
aylmer
limped
as
loudly
as
he
could
and
they
evidently
heard
him
but
did
mind
in
the
least
he
did
want
miss
clay
to
stop
at
home
he
was
expecting
edith
it
let
them
go
he
said
to
himself
and
he
wondered
at
himself
why
should
he
care
why
she
flirt
with
the
boy
if
she
liked
or
rather
for
he
was
too
just
not
to
own
that
it
was
no
desire
of
hers
why
should
the
boy
make
up
to
her
whatever
the
reason
was
it
annoyed
him
annoyance
was
soon
forgotten
when
mrs
ottley
was
announced
since
their
drive
to
richmond
there
had
been
a
period
of
extraordinary
happiness
and
delight
for
edith
not
another
word
had
been
said
with
reference
to
aylmer
proposal
he
left
it
in
abeyance
for
he
saw
to
his
great
joy
and
delight
that
she
was
becoming
her
old
self
more
than
her
old
self
edith
was
completely
changed
the
first
thing
she
thought
of
now
in
the
morning
was
how
soon
she
should
see
him
again
she
managed
to
conceal
it
well
but
she
was
nervous
absent
with
her
eyes
always
on
the
clock
counting
the
minutes
when
other
people
were
present
she
was
cool
and
friendly
to
aylmer
but
when
they
were
alone
he
had
become
intimate
delightful
familiar
like
the
time
three
years
ago
when
they
were
together
at
the
seaside
but
her
had
then
been
in
the
house
and
the
children
everything
was
so
conventional
now
she
was
able
to
see
him
alone
really
alone
his
eyes
welcomed
her
as
she
came
in
having
shut
the
door
quietly
she
reached
his
chair
in
a
little
rush
take
off
your
hat
i
like
that
hat
that
was
the
hat
you
wore
the
day
i
told
you
glad
it
suits
me
she
said
interrupting
it
really
it
too
small
know
it
does
he
was
holding
her
hand
he
slowly
took
off
the
glove
saying
a
funny
woman
you
are
edith
why
do
you
wear
grey
gloves
nobody
else
wears
grey
gloves
prefer
white
ones
but
they
wo
stay
white
two
like
these
me
about
teddy
do
aylmer
aylmer
was
kissing
her
fingers
one
by
one
she
drew
them
away
oh
there
not
much
to
tell
then
he
gave
a
little
laugh
believe
he
fallen
in
love
with
miss
clay
he
really
well
no
wonder
think
how
pretty
she
is

bit
pretty

would
you
he
laughed
with
your
independent
mind
and
your
cleverness
not
exactly
but
i
can
imagine
worse
things
shall
take
you
to
egypt
he
said
never
been
there
have
you
her
eyes
sparkled
i
shall
take
you
to
see
the
sphinx
for
the
first
time
you
ca
you
looking
very
well
aylmer
wonderfully
better
wonder
why
you
do
think
i
happy
do
you
am
said
edith
you
a
woman
you
live
for
the
moment
i
anxious
about
the
future
oh
you
quite
wrong
it
not
women
who
live
for
the
moment
said
edith
i
do
know
that
the
average
woman
does
but
then
you
not
an
average
woman
am
i
edith
he
answered
rather
fatuously
but
she
liked
it
she
moved
away
that
awfully
mean
of
you
taking
advantage
of
my
wounded
limb
she
rang
for
tea
that
even
meaner
it
treacherous
he
said
laughing
she
sat
down
on
a
chair
at
a
little
distance
he
said
in
a
low
distinct
voice
is
not
for
me
to
dictate
said
edith
in
a
tone
of
command
i
should
think
it
more
sensible
of
you
not
to
say
these
things
to
me
just
now
the
servant
came
in
with
tea
chapter
xxiv
just
before
archie
went
back
to
school
he
made
a
remark
that
impressed
edith
strangely
quite
dressed
and
ready
to
start
as
he
was
putting
on
his
gloves
he
fell
into
one
of
his
reveries
after
being
silent
for
some
time
he
said
darling
does
father
fight
told
you
before
darling
your
father
is
not
very
strong
dear
aylmer
older
than
father
aylmer
four
years
older
why
do
know
i
wish
i
had
a
father
who
could
fight
like
aylmer
and
i
like
to
fight
too
like
teddy
has
any
wife
and
children
to
leave
teddy
eighteen
only
ten
dear
wish
i
was
old
enough
to
fight
and
i
wish
father
was
stronger
do
you
think
i
shall
ever
fight
in
this
war
heavens
dear
i
hope
it
is
going
to
last
seven
years
more
wish
it
would
said
archie
ferociously
darling
what
the
matter
with
father
he
seems
quite
well
he
is
very
well
he
suffers
from
nerves
what
nerves
think
darling
it
time
for
us
to
start
where
your
coat
she
drove
him
to
the
station
most
of
the
way
he
was
very
silent
as
she
put
him
in
the
train
he
said
give
my
love
to
aylmer
right
dear
he
then
said
i
wish
aylmer
was
my
father
archie
you
must
say
that
but
she
never
forgot
the
boy
remark
it
had
a
stronger
influence
on
her
action
later
than
anything
else
she
knew
archie
had
always
had
a
great
for
aylmer
but
that
he
should
actually
prefer
him
to
bruce
she
did
tell
aylmer
that
for
a
long
time
afterwards
before
returning
to
the
front
teddy
had
become
so
violently
devoted
to
miss
clay
that
she
was
quite
glad
to
see
him
go
she
received
his
attentions
with
calm
and
cool
friendliness
but
gave
him
not
the
smallest
encouragement
she
was
three
years
older
but
looked
younger
than
her
age
while
teddy
looked
much
older
more
like
so
that
when
on
the
one
or
two
occasions
during
his
ten
days
leave
they
went
out
together
they
did
seem
at
all
an
couple
and
whenever
aylmer
saw
the
two
together
it
created
the
greatest
irritation
in
him
he
hardly
knew
which
vexed
him
more
dulcie
for
being
attractive
to
the
boy
or
the
boy
for
being
charmed
by
dulcie
it
was
absurd
out
of
place
it
displeased
him
a
day
or
two
after
teddy
departure
dulcie
went
to
see
lady
conroy
who
immediately
declared
that
dulcie
was
extraordinarily
like
a
charming
girl
she
had
met
at
boulogne
dulcie
convinced
her
that
she
was
the
same
girl
how
perfectly
charming
said
lady
conroy
a
coincidence
wonderful
well
my
dear
i
can
see
at
a
glance
that
you
the
very
person
i
want
your
duties
will
be
very
light
oh
how
light
they
will
be
there
really
hardly
anything
to
do
i
merely
want
you
to
be
a
sort
of
walking
memorandum
for
me
lady
conroy
went
on
smiling
to
recollect
what
day
it
is
and
what
the
date
and
what
time
my
appointments
are
and
do
my
telephoning
for
me
and
write
my
letters
and
take
the
dog
out
for
a
walk
and
just
hear
my
little
girls
practise
and
keep
my
papers
in
order
oh
one
can
hardly
say
exactly
you
know
the
sort
of
thing
oh
yes
and
do
the
flowers
said
lady
conroy
glancing
round
the
room
always
forget
my
flowers
and
i
wo
let
marie
do
them
and
so
there
they
are
dead
in
the
vases
and
i
do
like
a
few
live
flowers
about
i
must
say
she
added
pathetically
dulcie
said
she
thought
she
could
undertake
it
then
wo
you
stay
now
and
have
your
things
sent
straight
on
oh
do
i
do
wish
you
would
i
got
two
stalls
for
the
st
tonight
my
husband
ca
come
and
i
ca
think
of
anybody
else
to
ask
i
should
love
to
take
you
dulcie
would
have
enjoyed
to
go
the
theatre
was
a
passion
with
her
as
with
most
naïve
people
she
made
some
slight
objection
which
lady
conroy
at
once
waved
away
however
dulcie
pointed
out
that
she
must
go
home
first
and
as
all
terms
and
arrangements
absolutely
suited
both
parties
it
was
decided
that
dulcie
should
go
to
the
play
with
her
tonight
and
come
the
next
day
to
take
up
her
duties
she
asked
lady
conroy
if
she
might
have
her
meals
alone
when
there
were
guests
as
she
was
very
shy
a
charming
little
opening
out
of
the
was
put
at
her
disposal
certainly
dear
always
of
course
except
when
i
alone
but
you
come
when
i
ask
you
now
and
then
wo
you
i
thought
you
be
very
useful
sometimes
at
boring
lunches
or
when
there
were
too
many
men
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
hear
you
sing
oh
that
will
be
delightful
you
sing
when
we
have
a
few
tedious
people
with
us
i
adore
music
we
go
to
some
of
those
concerts
wo
we
we
must
be
patriotic
do
you
know
it
really
been
my
dream
to
have
a
sweet
useful
sympathetic
girl
in
the
house
and
with
a
memory
too
charming
dulcie
went
away
fascinated
if
slightly
bewildered
it
was
a
pang
to
her
to
say
to
aylmer
the
more
so
as
he
showed
in
a
way
that
was
perfectly
obvious
to
the
girl
that
he
was
pleased
to
see
her
go
though
he
was
as
cordial
as
possible
she
had
been
an
embarrassment
to
him
of
late
it
was
beginning
to
be
what
is
known
as
a
false
position
since
headley
the
butler
could
now
look
after
aylmer
except
for
a
limp
he
was
practically
well
anyone
who
has
ever
nursed
a
person
to
whom
they
are
devoted
helped
him
through
weakness
and
danger
to
health
again
will
understand
the
curious
pain
she
felt
to
see
him
independent
of
her
anxious
to
show
his
strength
still
he
had
been
perfect
she
would
always
remember
him
with
worship
she
meant
never
to
love
anyone
else
all
her
life
when
she
said
she
said
to
him
do
hope
you
be
very
happy
he
laughed
coloured
a
little
and
said
as
he
squeezed
her
hand
warmly
been
a
brick
to
me
miss
clay
i
shall
certainly
tell
you
if
i
ever
am
happy
she
wondered
what
that
meant
but
she
preferred
to
try
to
forget
it
when
dulcie
arrived
as
she
had
been
told
at
a
quarter
to
eight
dressed
in
a
black
evening
dress
she
did
care
to
wear
uniform
at
the
theatre
she
found
lady
conroy
who
was
lying
on
the
sofa
in
a
utterly
astonished
to
see
her
dear
you
come
to
dine
with
me
after
all
indeed
i
dined
you
said
i
was
to
come
in
time
to
go
to
the
play
play
oh
i
forgot
i
so
sorry
i
sent
the
tickets
away
i
forgot
i
anyone
to
go
with
me
i
afraid
it
ca
be
helped
now
are
you
very
disappointed
poor
child
well
dear
you
dine
with
me
anyhow
as
you
come
and
i
can
tell
you
all
about
what
we
shall
have
to
do
and
everything
we
go
to
the
theatre
some
other
evening
dulcie
was
obliged
to
decline
eating
two
dinners
she
had
not
found
it
possible
to
get
through
one
her
last
meal
at
aylmer
house
however
as
she
had
no
idea
what
else
to
do
she
remained
with
lady
conroy
and
she
spent
a
very
pleasant
evening
lady
conroy
told
her
all
about
herself
her
husband
her
children
and
her
friends
she
told
her
the
history
of
her
life
occasionally
branching
off
on
to
other
subjects
and
referring
to
the
angel
she
had
met
on
a
boat
who
was
in
the
black
watch
and
who
dulcie
gathered
was
a
wounded
officer
lady
conroy
described
all
the
dresses
she
had
at
present
many
that
she
had
had
in
former
years
and
others
that
she
would
like
to
have
had
now
she
gravely
told
the
girl
the
most
inaccurate
gossip
about
such
of
her
friends
as
dulcie
might
possibly
meet
later
she
was
confidential
amusing
brilliant
and
inconsequent
she
appeared
enchanted
with
dulcie
whom
she
treated
like
an
intimate
friend
at
sight
and
dulcie
was
charmed
with
her
though
somewhat
confused
at
her
curious
memory
indeed
they
parted
at
about
eleven
the
best
possible
friends
lady
conroy
insisting
on
sending
her
home
in
her
car
dulcie
who
had
a
sensitive
and
sensible
horror
of
snobbishness
felt
sorry
to
know
that
her
father
would
casually
mention
that
his
daughter
was
staying
with
the
conroys
in
carlton
house
terrace
and
that
her
stepmother
would
scold
her
unless
she
recollected
every
dress
she
happened
to
see
there
still
on
the
whole
she
felt
cheered
she
had
every
reason
to
hope
that
she
would
be
as
happy
as
a
companion
in
love
without
hope
of
a
return
could
be
under
any
circumstances
chapter
xxv
madame
frabelle
and
edith
were
sitting
side
by
side
in
edith
boudoir
madame
frabelle
was
knitting
edith
was
looking
at
a
book
it
was
a
thin
little
volume
of
essays
bound
by
miss
coniston
is
the
meaning
of
this
design
edith
said
seems
to
me
very
unsuited
to
chesterton
work
with
twirly
things
on
it
thought
it
rather
artistic
answered
madame
frabelle
looks
like
macaroni
or
spaghetti
perhaps
the
idea
was
suggested
by
your
showing
her
how
to
cook
it
said
edith
laughing
madame
frabelle
looked
gravely
serene
i
do
think
that
had
anything
to
do
with
it
literal
you
are
eglantine
i
i
think
you
do
me
injustice
edith
dear
returned
the
amiable
guest
with
a
tinge
of
stateliness
as
she
rolled
up
her
wool
edith
smiled
put
down
her
book
looked
at
the
clock
and
rearranged
the
large
cushion
behind
her
back
then
she
took
the
book
up
again
looked
through
it
and
again
put
it
down
not
at
all
forgive
me
for
saying
so
not
the
least
bit
in
the
world
restless
today
edith
darling
are
you
said
madame
frabelle
in
a
calm
clear
high
voice
that
edith
found
quite
trying
i
hope
not
i
think
not
that
well
and
madame
frabelle
with
one
slight
glance
at
her
hostess
went
on
knitting
believe
i
miss
archie
a
good
deal
said
edith
yes
you
must
indeed
i
miss
the
dear
boy
immensely
myself
sympathetically
said
madame
frabelle
but
edith
thought
madame
frabelle
bore
his
loss
with
a
good
deal
of
equanimity
and
she
owned
to
herself
that
it
was
not
surprising
the
lady
had
been
very
good
to
archie
but
he
had
teased
her
a
good
deal
like
the
boy
scouts
but
the
other
way
round
he
had
almost
made
a
point
of
worrying
her
in
some
way
or
other
every
day
edith
could
never
persuade
him
to
change
his
view
of
her
he
said
she
was
a
fool
somehow
today
edith
felt
rather
pleased
with
him
for
thinking
so
all
women
are
subject
to
moods
particularly
perhaps
those
who
have
a
visitor
staying
with
them
for
a
considerable
time
there
are
moments
of
injustice
of
unfairness
to
the
most
charming
feminine
guest
from
the
most
gentle
hostess
and
also
there
are
undoubtedly
times
when
the
nicest
hostess
gets
a
little
on
one
nerves
so
critical
highly
strung
madame
frabelle
was
feeling
today
so
was
edith
madame
frabelle
was
privately
thinking
that
edith
was
restless
that
she
had
lost
her
repose
that
her
lips
were
redder
than
they
used
to
be
had
she
taken
to
using
lip
salve
too
she
was
inclined
to
smile
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
at
madame
frabelle
remarks
a
shade
too
often
and
what
was
edith
thinking
of
at
this
moment
she
was
thinking
of
archie
remarks
about
madame
frabelle
that
boy
had
genius
but
there
would
be
a
reaction
probably
during
or
immediately
after
for
these
two
women
were
sincerely
fond
of
one
another
the
irritating
fact
that
edith
was
eighteen
years
younger
than
her
guest
made
eglantine
feel
sometimes
a
desire
to
guide
even
to
direct
her
and
if
she
had
the
disadvantage
in
age
she
wanted
at
least
the
privilege
of
gratifying
her
longing
to
give
advice
the
desire
became
too
strong
to
be
resisted
the
advantage
of
having
something
to
do
with
her
hands
while
she
spoke
was
too
great
a
one
not
to
be
taken
advantage
of
so
madame
frabelle
said
dear
been
wanting
to
say
something
to
you
edith
leant
forward
putting
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
her
face
on
her
hands
and
said
tell
me
eglantine
what
is
it
is
simply
this
said
the
other
lady
calmly
continuing
her
knitting
often
when
one
living
with
a
person
one
notice
little
things
a
comparative
stranger
would
observe
is
that
not
so
have
you
observed
what
it
about
is
about
your
husband
said
madame
frabelle
bruce
asked
edith
replied
madame
frabelle
dryly
have
you
observed
about
bruce
have
observed
replied
madame
frabelle
putting
her
hand
in
the
sock
that
she
was
knitting
and
looking
at
it
critically
her
head
on
one
side
have
observed
that
bruce
is
not
at
all
well
i
sorry
you
think
that
it
true
he
has
seemed
rather
what
he
calls
off
colour
lately
suffers
said
madame
frabelle
as
if
announcing
a
great
discovery
he
suffers
from
nerves
know
he
does
my
dear
who
should
know
it
better
than
i
do
but
do
you
think
he
is
worse
lately
do
he
is
terribly
depressed
he
says
things
to
me
sometimes
that
well
that
really
quite
alarm
me
sorry
but
you
must
take
bruce
too
seriously
you
know
that
i
do
take
him
too
seriously
and
i
done
my
best
either
to
change
the
subject
or
to
make
him
see
the
silver
lining
to
every
cloud
madame
frabelle
answered
solemnly
with
a
shake
of
her
head
think
what
bruce
complains
of
is
the
want
of
a
silver
lining
to
his
purse
edith
said
are
jesting
edith
dear
i
not
he
worries
about
money
only
incidentally
said
madame
frabelle
is
really
worried
about
the
war
but
surely
i
suppose
we
all
are
ottley
takes
it
particularly
to
heart
said
madame
frabelle
with
a
kind
of
touching
dignity
edith
looked
at
her
in
a
little
surprise
why
did
she
suddenly
call
bruce
husband
or
ottley
this
distant
manner
eglantine
said
edith
half
laughing
thought
you
always
called
him
bruce
beg
your
pardon
yes
i
forgot
well
do
you
see
edith
dear
that
what
we
might
call
his
depression
his
melancholy
point
of
view
is
is
growing
worse
and
worse
edith
got
up
walked
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
rearranged
some
violets
in
a
copper
vase
and
came
back
to
the
sofa
again
madame
frabelle
followed
her
with
her
eyes
then
edith
said
picking
up
the
knitting
care
dear
you
losing
your
wool
yes
perhaps
he
is
worse
he
might
be
better
if
he
occupied
his
mind
more
works
at
the
foreign
office
from
ten
till
four
every
day
said
madame
frabelle
in
a
tone
of
defence
looks
in
at
his
club
where
they
talk
over
the
news
of
the
war
and
then
he
comes
home
and
we
discuss
it
again
really
edith
i
scarcely
see
how
much
more
he
could
do
my
dear
but
do
you
see
all
the
time
he
does
do
anything
anything
about
the
war
i
mean
now
both
you
and
i
do
our
little
best
to
help
in
one
way
or
another
you
especially
i
sure
do
a
tremendous
lot
but
what
does
bruce
do
nothing
except
talk
just
it
edith
i
doubt
if
your
husband
is
in
a
fit
state
of
health
to
strain
his
mind
by
any
more
work
than
he
does
already
not
strong
dear
remember
that
course
i
know
if
he
were
all
right
he
would
be
here
said
edith
i
suppose
he
really
does
suffer
a
great
deal
was
it
again
that
prevented
him
joining
asked
madame
frabelle
with
sympathetic
tenderness
heart
answered
edith
though
she
tried
her
very
utmost
she
could
not
help
the
tone
of
her
voice
sounding
a
little
dry
and
ironical
of
course
she
did
not
in
the
least
believe
in
bruce
neurotic
heart
but
she
did
not
want
madame
frabelle
to
know
that
ah
that
must
cause
him
a
great
deal
of
pain
but
i
think
so
far
his
worst
symptoms
are
his
nervous
fears
look
at
last
night
continued
madame
frabelle
and
now
she
put
down
her
knitting
and
folded
it
into
her
last
night
because
there
was
no
moon
and
it
raining
and
fairly
clear
mr
ott
bruce
had
absolutely
made
up
his
mind
there
would
be
a
zeppelin
raid
it
was
his
own
idea
quite
dear
young
coniston
who
is
a
special
constable
rang
up
and
told
him
that
there
was
a
chance
of
the
zeppelins
last
night
perhaps
so
at
any
rate
he
believed
it
well
instead
of
being
satisfied
when
i
told
him
that
i
had
got
out
my
mask
that
i
saw
to
the
bath
being
left
with
water
helped
your
husband
to
put
two
large
bags
of
sand
outside
his
in
spite
of
all
that
do
you
know
what
happened
in
the
middle
of
the
night
afraid
i
do
said
edith
archie
went
back
to
school
i
have
had
dilly
in
my
room
and
we
both
slept
soundly
all
night
you
i
fancied
i
saw
a
light
in
your
room
this
was
quite
true
edith
was
writing
a
very
long
letter
perhaps
at
three
in
the
morning
fancy
my
surprise
to
hear
a
knock
at
my
door
wonder
i
did
hear
a
knock
at
mine
said
edith
husband
was
afraid
to
disturb
the
little
girl
most
considerate
i
thought
well
he
knocked
at
my
door
and
said
that
he
was
unable
to
sleep
that
he
felt
terribly
miserable
and
melancholy
in
fact
was
wretched
and
that
he
felt
on
the
point
of
cutting
his
throat
be
frightened
dear
i
do
mean
that
he
really
it
said
madame
frabelle
putting
her
hand
on
edith
fellow
but
what
a
shame
to
disturb
you
did
mind
in
the
least
i
was
only
too
pleased
well
what
do
you
think
i
did
i
got
up
and
dressed
went
down
to
the
library
and
lighted
the
fire
and
sat
up
for
with
your
husband
trying
to
cheer
him
up
you
really
edith
smiled
was
very
sweet
of
you
eglantine
at
all
i
was
only
too
glad
i
made
a
cup
of
tea
bruce
had
a
whisky
and
soda
we
had
a
nice
talk
and
i
sent
him
back
quite
cheerful
still
it
just
shows
does
it
how
terribly
he
takes
it
all
hard
on
you
eglantine
quite
improper
too
laughed
edith
as
she
rang
the
bell
madame
frabelle
ignored
this
remark
i
could
only
feel
at
all
that
i
done
a
little
good
during
my
stay
here
i
shall
be
quite
satisfied
but
you
must
dream
yet
of
began
edith
there
was
a
ring
at
the
bell
here
is
bruce
just
in
time
for
tea
edith
went
to
meet
him
in
the
hall
although
he
came
in
with
his
key
he
invariably
rang
the
bell
so
that
the
maid
could
take
his
coat
and
stick
edith
he
said
in
a
rather
sober
tone
are
you
and
where
is
madame
frabelle
chapter
xxvi
bruce
came
in
with
a
rather
weary
air
and
sat
down
by
the
fire
madame
frabelle
was
presiding
at
the
are
you
feeling
bruce
edith
asked
pretty
rotten
i
had
a
very
bad
night
how
are
you
madame
frabelle
very
well
tea
bruce
said
edith
kindly
and
poor
madame
frabelle
she
added
with
a
smile
bruce
gave
madame
frabelle
a
slightly
reproachful
look
as
he
took
a
cup
of
tea
from
her
been
telling
edith
said
that
lady
in
a
quiet
dignified
way
about
last
night
said
madame
frabelle
passing
bruce
the
buttered
toast
without
looking
at
him
as
if
avoiding
his
glance
really
very
much
ashamed
of
it
said
bruce
ca
think
how
kind
she
was
to
me
edith
sure
she
was
said
edith
you
wo
have
a
bad
night
like
that
again
said
madame
frabelle
cheerily
sure
i
hope
not
he
gave
a
dark
despairing
look
and
sighed
my
word
if
it
had
been
for
her
i
do
know
what
i
would
have
done
he
shook
his
head
and
stroked
his
back
hair
suddenly
edith
felt
intensely
bored
madame
frabelle
and
bruce
were
looking
at
each
other
with
such
intense
sympathy
and
she
knew
they
would
repeat
in
different
words
what
they
had
said
already
they
were
so
certain
to
go
over
the
same
ground
again
and
again
edith
felt
she
was
not
wanted
but
that
did
annoy
her
she
was
merely
thinking
of
an
excuse
to
get
away
from
them
the
way
how
aylmer
edith
asked
bruce
on
well
i
believe
he
been
ordered
out
of
town
the
seaside
for
god
sake
do
let
him
go
to
the
east
coast
east
coast
is
quite
as
safe
as
any
other
part
of
england
think
said
madame
frabelle
he
take
his
chance
edith
replied
expect
he
miss
my
dear
said
bruce
been
so
jolly
good
to
him
lately
said
madame
frabelle
a
little
quickly
very
smoothly
and
with
what
edith
thought
unnecessary
tact
anyone
so
as
edith
would
be
sure
to
try
and
cheer
up
the
convalescence
of
a
wounded
friend
have
a
sandwich
edith
edith
felt
an
almost
irresistible
desire
to
laugh
at
something
in
the
hospitable
almost
patronising
tone
of
her
guest
edith
likes
going
to
see
him
said
bruce
to
madame
frabelle
do
i
if
it
comes
to
that
we
all
fond
of
old
aylmer
you
know
know
i
quite
understand
you
great
friends
personally
i
think
mr
ross
has
behaved
splendidly
madame
frabelle
said
this
with
an
air
of
and
scrupulous
justice
do
care
very
much
about
him
i
fancy
said
bruce
with
the
air
of
having
made
a
subtle
discovery
she
raised
one
eyebrow
slightly
wo
say
that
i
see
very
excellent
points
in
him
i
admit
there
a
certain
coldness
a
certain
hard
reserve
about
his
character
that
well
frankly
it
does
appeal
to
me
but
i
hope
i
am
fair
to
him
he
a
man
i
respect
yes
i
respect
him
he
does
amuse
you
what
said
bruce
fact
is
he
has
no
sense
of
humour
said
madame
frabelle
your
finding
that
out
now
said
bruce
with
a
broad
smile
ha
ha
very
funny
do
you
know
it
never
occurred
to
me
but
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
yes
perhaps
that
what
the
matter
with
him
mind
you
i
call
him
a
jolly
cheery
sort
of
chap
quite
an
optimist
a
distinct
optimist
you
never
find
aylmer
depressed
not
depressed
it
is
that
but
he
has
got
you
wo
either
of
you
be
angry
with
me
for
what
i
say
will
you
no
indeed
wo
be
cross
with
me
edith
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
say
it
do
tell
us
urged
edith
what
i
consider
is
the
defect
in
aylmer
ross
is
that
he
has
brains
but
no
temperament
cried
bruce
true
temperament
that
what
he
wants
edith
remembered
hearing
that
phrase
used
in
her
presence
to
madame
frabelle
not
about
aylmer
but
about
someone
else
it
was
very
characteristic
of
madame
frabelle
to
catch
up
an
idea
or
a
phrase
misapply
it
and
then
firmly
regard
it
as
her
own
bruce
shook
his
head
but
no
temperament
excellent
you
that
does
prevent
him
being
an
excellent
soldier
went
on
madame
frabelle
dear
no
he
done
jolly
well
said
bruce
think
i
know
what
she
means
do
you
edith
sure
does
said
edith
who
had
her
doubts
do
know
that
i
do
quite
know
what
people
mean
when
they
say
other
people
got
temperament
the
question
is
what
temperament
my
dear
it
a
sort
of
a
something
an
atmosphere
a
sympathy
what
i
might
call
the
magnetism
of
personality
right
said
bruce
passing
his
cup
for
another
cup
of
tea
hard
hard
as
nails
he
got
the
name
of
being
rather
and
impulsive
though
suggested
edith
he
enough
said
bruce
generous
i
known
him
to
do
ever
so
many
kind
things
and
never
let
a
soul
except
the
fellow
he
helped
know
anything
about
it
do
understand
me
said
madame
frabelle
do
doubt
that
for
a
moment
he
a
generous
man
because
he
has
a
sense
of
duty
and
of
the
claims
of
others
but
he
has
the
effect
on
me
on
eglantine
he
chills
me
said
madame
frabelle
i
went
to
see
him
with
edith
i
felt
more
tired
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
talk
with
him
than
i
would
she
glanced
at
bruce
you
would
after
hours
with
landi
or
bruce
or
byrne
fraser
or
young
coniston
suggested
edith
what
i
mean
he
difficult
to
talk
to
have
no
doubt
you
right
said
edith
she
generally
is
said
bruce
only
thing
is
she
so
infernally
deep
sometimes
she
sees
things
in
people
that
nobody
else
would
suspect
oh
you
do
you
know
do
i
said
madame
frabelle
modestly
i
think
you
do
said
edith
who
by
this
time
felt
inclined
to
throw
the
at
her
guest
the
last
fortnight
edith
nerves
had
certainly
not
been
quite
calm
formerly
she
would
have
been
amused
at
the
stupidity
of
the
conversation
now
she
felt
irritated
bored
and
worried
except
when
she
was
with
aylmer
there
was
a
moment
silence
bruce
leant
back
and
half
shut
his
eyes
madame
frabelle
softly
put
a
cushion
behind
his
shoulder
putting
a
finger
on
her
lip
as
she
looked
at
edith
edith
suddenly
got
up
wo
think
it
horrid
of
me
bruce
i
got
to
go
out
for
a
few
minutes
no
no
no
said
bruce
not
do
go
my
dear
girl
be
back
to
dinner
of
course
it
is
a
quarter
to
six
her
eyes
were
bright
she
looked
full
of
elasticity
and
spirit
again
quite
forgot
she
said
that
i
promised
to
do
for
mrs
mitchell
and
she
be
disappointed
if
i
do
know
what
it
is
said
madame
frabelle
archly
about
that
society
for
the
belgians
she
lowered
her
voice
mean
the
children
it
said
edith
gratefully
i
fly
and
be
back
as
soon
as
i
can
bruce
got
up
and
opened
the
door
for
her
heaven
sake
do
treat
me
with
ceremony
my
dear
edith
said
madame
frabelle
she
made
a
little
sign
as
much
as
to
say
that
she
would
look
after
bruce
but
she
was
not
very
successful
in
expressing
anything
by
a
look
or
a
gesture
edith
had
no
idea
what
she
meant
however
she
nodded
in
return
as
if
she
fully
comprehended
and
then
ran
up
to
her
room
put
on
her
hat
and
too
impatient
to
wait
while
the
servant
called
a
cab
walked
as
quickly
as
possible
until
she
met
one
near
the
top
of
sloane
street
it
was
already
very
dark
jermyn
street
said
edith
as
she
jumped
in
ten
minutes
later
she
was
sitting
next
to
aylmer
for
a
second
i
felt
i
must
see
you
angel
said
aylmer
beaming
and
kissing
her
hand
is
too
irritating
for
words
today
and
madame
frabelle
makes
me
sick
i
ca
stand
her
at
least
today
edith
do
tell
me
you
jealous
of
the
woman
i
wo
stand
it
i
sha
play
heavens
no
not
in
the
least
but
her
society
so
tedious
at
times
she
has
such
a
pompous
way
of
discovering
the
obvious
do
believe
you
object
to
her
being
in
love
with
bruce
said
aylmer
reproachfully
a
thing
i
will
stand
i
do
besides
she
not
who
could
be
and
do
be
jealous
of
bruce
aylmer
i
know
she
very
motherly
to
him
and
kind
but
she
the
same
to
everyone
they
talked
on
for
a
few
minutes
then
edith
said
i
must
go
said
aylmer
are
you
going
to
let
me
go
already
she
asked
reproachfully
she
leant
over
him
some
impulse
seemed
to
draw
her
near
to
him
using
that
omar
khayyám
scent
again
he
said
wish
you
would
you
said
you
liked
it
do
like
it
i
like
it
too
much
she
came
nearer
aylmer
gently
pushed
her
away
unkind
you
are
she
said
colouring
a
little
with
hurt
feeling
ca
do
that
sort
of
thing
said
aylmer
in
a
low
voice
once
you
given
me
your
promise
but
not
before
aylmer
wo
rush
you
you
see
i
right
in
time
dear
girl
do
love
me
suddenly
exclaimed
edith
that
where
you
wrong
i
do
love
you
and
i
wish
you
go
she
looked
into
his
eyes
and
then
said
looking
away
you
really
going
out
of
town
ordered
to
but
i
doubt
if
i
can
stand
it
aylmer
dear
are
you
going
already
cruel
girl
you
just
sent
me
away
can
stand
talking
to
you
edith
talking
for
hours
but
i
stand
your
being
within
a
yard
of
me
you
so
much
she
said
laughing
and
arranging
her
hat
in
front
of
the
mirror
he
spoke
in
a
lower
voice
often
must
i
tell
you
you
know
perfectly
well
not
that
sort
of
man
sort
after
a
moment
pause
he
said
ca
kiss
people
very
glad
you
ca
i
have
no
wish
for
you
to
kiss
ca
kiss
i
do
know
how
anyone
can
i
ca
do
those
things
she
pretended
not
to
hear
looked
round
the
room
took
up
a
book
and
said
you
lend
me
this
aylmer
i
give
it
you
darling
said
aylmer
ringing
the
bell
the
butler
called
her
a
cab
and
she
drove
to
mrs
mitchell
when
she
got
to
the
door
she
left
a
message
with
the
footman
to
say
she
had
been
able
to
see
about
that
matter
for
mrs
mitchell
yet
but
would
do
it
tomorrow
just
as
she
was
speaking
mr
mitchell
came
up
to
the
door
hallo
hallo
he
cried
in
his
cheery
booming
voice
edith
how
bruce
you
ought
to
know
he
been
with
you
today
said
edith
seems
a
bit
off
colour
at
the
foreign
office
wo
you
all
three
come
and
dine
with
us
tomorrow
no
party
i
going
to
ring
up
and
get
aylmer
it
wo
hurt
him
to
dine
quietly
with
us
shall
be
delighted
said
edith
mr
mitchell
did
like
to
see
her
go
but
as
he
was
longing
to
tell
his
wife
a
hundred
things
that
interested
them
both
he
waved
his
hand
to
her
saying
the
war
will
be
over
in
six
months
mark
my
words
and
then
wo
we
have
a
good
time
mr
mitchell
said
edith
to
herself
as
she
drove
back
home
in
the
dark
chapter
xxvii
landi
was
growing
rather
anxious
about
his
favourite
for
it
was
quite
obvious
to
him
that
she
was
daily
becoming
more
and
more
under
the
spell
curious
that
the
first
time
she
should
have
found
the
courage
to
refuse
and
that
now
after
three
years
absence
and
with
nothing
to
complain
of
particularly
on
the
subject
of
her
husband
she
should
now
be
so
carried
away
by
this
love
she
had
developed
no
doubt
she
was
touched
also
deeply
moved
at
the
long
fidelity
aylmer
had
shown
he
was
now
no
longer
an
impulsive
admirer
but
a
devotee
even
that
however
would
not
have
induced
her
to
think
of
making
such
a
break
in
her
life
if
it
had
been
for
the
war
yes
sir
tito
put
it
all
down
to
the
war
it
had
an
exciting
thrilling
effect
on
people
it
made
them
reckless
when
a
woman
knows
that
the
man
she
loves
has
risked
his
life
and
is
only
too
anxious
to
risk
it
again
well
it
natural
that
she
should
feel
she
is
also
willing
to
risk
something
valour
has
always
been
rewarded
by
beauty
and
then
her
great
sense
of
responsibility
her
conscientiousness
about
bruce
no
wonder
that
had
been
undermined
by
his
own
weak
conduct
how
could
edith
help
feeling
a
slight
contempt
for
a
husband
who
not
only
would
take
any
chances
while
he
was
still
within
the
age
but
positively
imagined
himself
ill
true
bruce
had
always
been
a
like
many
others
with
the
same
weakness
his
valetudinarianism
had
been
terribly
increased
by
the
anxiety
and
worry
of
the
war
but
there
was
not
much
sympathy
about
for
it
just
now
while
so
much
real
suffering
was
going
on
imaginary
ills
were
ignored
despised
or
forgotten
bruce
hated
the
war
but
he
did
hate
it
for
the
sake
of
other
people
so
much
as
for
his
own
the
interest
that
the
world
took
in
it
positively
bored
him
absurd
as
it
seems
to
say
so
edith
was
convinced
that
he
was
positively
jealous
of
the
general
interest
in
it
he
had
great
fear
of
losing
his
money
a
great
terror
of
zeppelins
he
gave
way
to
his
nerves
instead
of
trying
to
control
them
edith
knew
his
greatest
wish
would
have
been
had
it
been
possible
to
get
right
away
from
everything
and
go
and
live
in
spain
or
america
or
somewhere
where
he
could
hear
no
more
about
the
war
such
a
point
of
view
might
be
understood
in
the
case
say
of
a
great
poet
a
great
artist
a
man
of
genius
without
any
feeling
of
patriotism
or
even
a
man
beyond
the
age
but
bruce
he
was
the
most
ordinary
and
average
of
human
beings
the
most
commonplace
englishman
of
who
had
ever
been
born
that
bruce
should
feel
like
that
did
seem
to
edith
a
little
contemptible
yet
she
was
sorry
for
him
she
knew
he
really
suffered
from
insomnia
and
nerves
though
he
looked
a
fine
man
and
had
always
been
regarded
as
a
fair
sportsman
he
had
been
fair
at
football
and
cricket
and
could
row
a
bit
and
was
an
enthusiastic
golfist
still
edith
knew
he
would
never
have
made
a
soldier
bruce
wanted
to
be
wrapped
up
in
cotton
wool
petted
humoured
looked
up
to
and
generally
spoilt
but
what
sir
tito
felt
most
was
the
thought
of
his
favourite
who
had
forgiven
her
husband
that
escapade
three
years
ago
now
appearing
in
an
unfavourable
light
she
had
been
absolutely
faithful
to
bruce
in
every
way
under
many
temptations
and
he
knew
she
was
still
absolutely
faithful
aylmer
and
edith
were
neither
of
them
the
people
for
secret
meetings
for
deception
it
was
not
in
her
to
her
husband
while
pretending
to
be
a
devoted
wife
and
it
was
equally
unlike
aylmer
to
be
a
false
friend
landi
was
too
much
of
a
man
of
the
world
to
have
been
particularly
shocked
even
if
he
had
known
they
had
both
deceived
bruce
privately
for
edith
own
sake
he
almost
wished
they
had
he
hated
scandal
to
touch
her
he
thought
she
would
feel
it
more
than
she
supposed
but
after
all
he
reflected
had
they
begun
in
that
way
it
would
have
been
sure
to
end
in
an
elopement
with
a
man
of
aylmer
spirit
and
determination
aylmer
besides
was
far
too
exclusive
in
his
affections
far
too
jealous
ever
to
be
able
to
endure
to
see
edith
under
thumb
ordered
about
trying
to
please
him
and
indeed
landi
was
most
anxious
that
they
should
not
be
alone
too
much
in
case
now
that
edith
cared
for
him
so
much
his
feelings
would
carry
him
away
yes
if
it
once
went
too
far
the
elopement
was
a
certainty
would
the
world
blame
her
so
very
much
that
bruce
would
let
her
take
the
children
landi
had
no
doubt
he
would
never
stand
the
bother
of
them
he
would
desire
the
responsibility
his
pride
might
be
a
little
hurt
but
on
the
whole
sir
tito
shrewdly
suspected
as
did
edith
herself
that
there
would
be
a
certain
feeling
of
relief
bruce
had
become
such
an
egotist
that
though
he
would
miss
edith
devotion
he
would
grudge
her
the
care
of
the
children
aylmer
had
pledged
her
his
faith
his
whole
future
undoubtedly
he
would
marry
her
and
take
the
children
as
his
own
still
edith
would
bear
the
brunt
before
the
world
this
sir
tito
did
not
fancy
at
all
and
instinctively
he
began
to
watch
bruce
he
felt
very
doubtful
of
him
the
man
who
had
flirted
with
the
governess
who
had
eloped
with
the
art
student
was
it
at
all
likely
that
he
was
utterly
faithful
to
edith
now
it
was
most
unlikely
and
edith
old
friend
hoped
that
things
would
be
adjusted
in
fairness
to
her
he
knew
she
would
be
happy
with
aylmer
why
should
she
not
at
begin
a
new
life
with
the
man
she
really
cared
for
a
splendid
fellow
a
man
with
a
fine
character
with
all
his
faults
who
felt
the
claims
of
others
who
had
brains
pluck
and
a
sense
of
honour
but
aylmer
was
going
out
again
to
the
front
until
he
returned
again
nothing
should
be
done
they
should
be
patient
chapter
xxviii
dulcie
had
now
been
settled
down
with
lady
conroy
for
about
a
week
she
found
her
luxurious
life
at
carlton
house
terrace
far
more
congenial
than
she
had
expected
her
own
orderly
ways
were
obviously
a
great
comfort
to
her
employer
and
though
lady
conroy
turned
everything
to
chaos
as
soon
as
dulcie
had
put
it
straight
still
she
certainly
had
a
good
effect
on
things
in
general
she
had
a
charming
to
herself
and
though
she
sometimes
sighed
for
the
little
chippendale
room
with
the
chintzes
at
jermyn
street
she
was
on
the
whole
very
contented
lady
conroy
was
a
delightful
companion
she
seldom
pressed
dulcie
to
come
down
to
meals
when
there
were
guests
occasionally
she
did
so
but
so
far
the
only
person
dulcie
had
met
more
than
once
was
valdez
the
handsome
composer
who
was
trying
so
hard
with
the
help
of
lady
conroy
and
his
war
emergency
concerts
to
assist
such
poor
musicians
as
were
suffering
from
the
war
and
at
the
same
time
to
assert
the
value
of
british
music
dulcie
had
been
immensely
struck
by
the
commanding
appearance
and
manner
of
valdez
known
everywhere
as
a
singer
a
writer
of
operas
and
a
favourite
of
foreign
royalties
landi
she
had
often
met
at
aylmer
but
privately
she
was
far
more
impressed
by
valdez
first
he
was
english
though
like
herself
of
spanish
descent
and
then
he
had
none
of
the
and
teasing
wit
that
made
her
uncomfortable
with
landi
he
treated
her
with
particularly
marked
courtesy
and
he
admired
her
voice
for
lady
conroy
had
insisted
on
her
singing
to
him
he
had
even
offered
when
he
had
more
time
to
give
her
a
few
lessons
lady
conroy
told
her
a
hundred
interesting
stories
about
him
and
dulcie
found
a
tinge
of
romance
about
him
that
helped
to
give
piquancy
to
her
present
life
dulcie
was
very
much
afraid
of
lord
conroy
though
he
did
appear
to
notice
her
in
his
own
way
he
was
as
as
his
wife
to
whom
he
was
devoted
but
whose
existence
was
entirely
independent
of
his
lord
conroy
had
his
own
library
his
own
secretary
his
own
suite
of
rooms
his
own
motor
he
did
even
tell
his
wife
when
he
intended
to
dine
out
and
if
he
occasionally
spoke
to
her
of
the
strained
political
situation
which
now
absorbed
him
it
certainly
was
when
dulcie
was
there
with
his
grey
beard
and
dark
eyebrows
and
absent
distinguished
manner
he
was
exactly
what
dulcie
would
have
dreamed
of
as
an
ideal
cabinet
minister
he
evidently
regarded
his
wife
despite
her
years
and
plumpness
almost
as
a
child
giving
her
complete
freedom
to
pursue
her
own
devices
admiring
her
appearance
and
smiling
at
her
lively
and
inconsequent
conversation
he
did
seem
to
take
her
seriously
dulcie
was
particularly
struck
by
the
fact
that
they
each
had
their
own
completely
distinct
circle
of
friends
and
except
when
they
gave
a
party
or
a
large
dinner
these
friends
hardly
met
and
certainly
did
clash
as
everyone
in
the
house
had
breakfasts
independently
and
as
dulcie
did
even
dine
downstairs
unless
lady
conroy
was
alone
she
saw
very
little
of
the
man
whom
she
knew
to
be
a
political
celebrity
and
whose
name
was
on
almost
everybody
lips
just
now
she
heard
from
his
wife
that
he
was
worried
and
anxious
and
hoped
the
war
would
last
much
longer
there
were
no
less
than
seven
children
from
the
age
of
twelve
downwards
two
of
these
lived
in
the
schoolroom
with
the
governess
one
boy
was
at
school
and
the
rest
lived
in
the
nursery
with
the
nurse
one
might
say
there
were
five
different
sets
of
people
living
different
lives
in
different
rooms
in
this
enormous
house
sometimes
dulcie
thought
it
was
hardly
quite
her
idea
of
home
life
a
thing
lady
conroy
talked
of
continually
with
great
sentiment
and
enthusiasm
but
it
was
pleasant
enough
since
she
was
here
to
remember
engagements
and
dates
everything
seemed
to
go
on
wheels
one
day
feeling
very
contented
and
in
good
spirits
she
had
gone
to
see
her
father
with
an
impulse
to
tell
him
how
well
she
was
getting
on
directly
the
door
was
opened
by
the
untidy
servant
dulcie
felt
that
something
had
happened
that
some
blow
had
fallen
everything
looked
different
she
found
her
father
in
his
den
surrounded
by
papers
his
appearance
and
manner
so
altered
that
the
first
thing
she
said
was
papa
what
the
matter
her
father
looked
up
at
his
expression
she
flew
to
him
and
threw
her
arms
round
him
then
of
course
he
broke
down
strange
that
with
all
women
and
most
men
it
is
only
genuine
sympathy
that
makes
them
give
way
with
a
cool
man
of
the
world
or
with
a
hard
cold
heartless
daughter
who
had
reproached
him
mr
clay
would
have
been
as
casual
as
an
undergraduate
at
her
sweetness
he
lost
his
and
then
he
told
her
everything
it
was
a
short
commonplace
story
quite
trivial
and
and
tragic
he
had
gambled
played
cards
lost
then
fallen
back
on
the
resource
of
the
and
gone
to
the
professional
lenders
mr
clay
was
not
the
sort
of
man
who
would
ever
become
a
sponge
a
nuisance
to
friends
he
was
far
too
proud
and
though
he
had
often
helped
other
people
he
had
never
yet
asked
for
help
in
a
word
the
poor
little
house
was
practically
in
ruins
or
rather
as
he
explained
frankly
enough
giving
all
details
unless
he
could
get
eighty
pounds
by
the
next
morning
his
furniture
would
be
sold
and
he
and
his
wife
would
be
turned
out
mr
clay
had
a
great
horror
of
a
smash
he
was
imprudent
even
reckless
but
had
the
sense
of
honour
that
would
cause
him
to
suffer
acutely
as
dulcie
knew
of
course
she
offered
to
help
surely
since
she
had
three
hundred
a
year
of
her
own
she
could
do
something
and
he
had
about
the
same
father
explained
that
he
had
already
sold
his
income
in
advance
and
her
own
legacy
had
been
left
so
that
she
was
barred
from
anticipation
dulcie
who
was
practical
enough
saw
that
her
own
tiny
income
was
absolutely
all
that
the
three
would
have
to
live
on
until
her
father
got
something
else
and
that
bankruptcy
was
inevitable
unless
she
could
get
him
eighty
pounds
in
a
day
so
little
he
said
pathetically
just
to
think
that
if
blue
boy
had
been
scratched
i
should
have
been
bound
to
well
well
i
know
i
not
going
to
bet
any
more
she
made
him
promise
to
buck
up
she
would
consult
her
friends
lady
conroy
would
perhaps
be
angelic
and
advance
her
her
salary
of
course
she
loathed
the
idea
when
she
had
been
there
only
a
week
of
being
a
nuisance
and
but
she
must
try
it
was
worth
anything
to
see
her
father
brighten
up
he
told
her
to
go
and
see
her
stepmother
clay
received
her
with
the
tenderest
expressions
and
poured
out
her
despairs
and
her
troubles
she
also
confided
in
dulcie
that
she
had
some
debts
that
her
husband
knew
nothing
of
and
must
know
if
only
dulcie
could
manage
to
get
her
thirty
pounds
surely
it
would
be
easy
enough
with
all
her
rich
friends
it
would
save
her
life
dulcie
promised
to
try
but
begged
her
not
to
bother
so
much
about
dress
in
future
course
i
wo
darling
you
a
pet
and
an
angel
dulcie
the
truth
is
i
adore
your
father
and
he
always
told
me
that
he
fell
in
love
with
me
because
i
looked
so
smart
i
was
so
terrified
of
losing
his
affection
by
getting
dowdy
do
you
see
besides
he
does
take
the
slightest
notice
what
i
wear
he
never
knows
what
got
on
always
betting
or
absorbed
in
the
racing
intelligence
really
dreadful
dulcie
promised
anything
at
least
to
do
her
best
if
only
mrs
clay
would
be
kind
sweet
to
her
father
scold
him
do
reproach
him
she
begged
sure
he
be
terribly
ill
unless
you
very
patient
and
sweet
to
him
and
i
promise
he
shall
never
know
about
your
debts
mrs
clay
looked
at
her
in
wonder
and
gratitude
the
real
reason
dulcie
took
on
herself
the
wife
separate
troubles
and
resolved
to
keep
them
from
her
father
was
that
she
felt
sure
that
if
he
reproached
his
wife
she
would
retort
and
then
there
would
be
a
miserable
state
of
feud
in
the
house
where
at
least
there
had
been
peace
and
affection
till
now
dulcie
could
endure
the
idea
of
her
father
being
made
unhappy
and
she
thought
that
by
making
her
stepmother
under
an
obligation
to
her
she
would
have
a
sort
of
hold
or
influence
and
could
make
her
behave
well
and
kindly
to
her
husband
dulcie
had
the
slightest
idea
how
she
was
going
to
do
it
but
she
would
she
never
even
thought
twice
about
giving
up
her
income
to
her
father
she
was
only
too
delighted
to
be
able
to
do
it
and
she
believed
that
his
pride
and
sense
of
honour
might
really
even
make
him
stop
gambling
and
then
there
was
some
chance
of
happiness
for
the
couple
again
dulcie
had
really
undertaken
more
of
a
sacrifice
for
her
stepmother
whom
she
rather
disliked
than
for
her
father
whom
she
adored
but
it
was
for
his
sake
she
left
them
cheered
grateful
and
relying
on
her
when
she
got
home
to
her
charming
room
at
carlton
house
terrace
she
sat
down
put
her
head
in
her
hands
and
began
to
think
she
had
undertaken
to
get
a
hundred
and
ten
pounds
in
two
days
how
was
she
to
do
it
of
course
she
knew
that
aylmer
ross
would
be
able
and
willing
indeed
enchanted
to
come
to
the
rescue
he
was
always
telling
her
that
she
had
saved
his
life
she
would
like
to
get
his
sympathy
and
interest
to
remind
him
of
her
existence
but
she
was
far
too
much
in
love
with
him
still
to
endure
the
thought
of
a
request
for
money
that
cold
douche
on
friendship
she
would
rather
go
to
anyone
in
the
world
than
aylmer
what
about
edith
ottley
edith
had
been
kindness
itself
to
her
it
was
entirely
through
edith
that
she
had
this
position
as
secretary
and
companion
at
a
salary
of
a
hundred
a
year
which
now
would
mean
so
much
to
her
she
admired
edith
more
than
any
woman
she
knew
she
thought
her
lovely
elegant
clever
fascinating
and
kindness
itself
yet
she
would
dislike
to
ask
edith
even
more
than
aylmer
the
reason
was
obvious
edith
was
her
rival
of
course
it
was
not
her
fault
she
had
not
taken
aylmer
away
from
her
she
was
his
old
friend
but
the
fact
remained
that
her
idol
was
in
love
with
edith
and
dulcie
was
so
constituted
that
she
could
ask
neither
of
them
a
favour
to
save
her
life
lady
conroy
then
but
how
awkward
how
disagreeable
how
painful
to
her
pride
when
she
had
been
there
only
a
week
and
lady
conroy
treated
her
almost
like
a
sister
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
in
said
dulcie
surprised
ever
came
to
her
little
at
this
hour
about
five
who
could
it
be
to
her
utter
astonishment
and
confusion
the
servant
announced
mr
valdez
dulcie
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
still
in
her
hat
and
coat
her
eyes
red
with
crying
for
she
had
utterly
given
way
when
she
got
home
she
was
amazed
and
confused
at
seeing
the
composer
who
came
calmly
in
holding
a
piece
of
music
in
his
hand
morning
miss
clay
please
forgive
me
i
hope
i
not
troubling
you
they
told
me
lady
conroy
was
out
but
that
you
were
at
home
and
up
here
and
i
hoped
he
glanced
at
the
highly
decorated
little
piano
this
room
had
been
known
as
the
before
it
was
given
to
dulcie
not
at
all
she
said
in
confusion
looking
up
and
regretting
her
crimson
and
swollen
eyes
and
generally
unprepared
appearance
he
immediately
came
close
to
her
sat
down
on
a
chair
opposite
her
sofa
leant
forward
and
said
abruptly
in
a
tone
of
warm
sympathy
are
distressed
what
is
it
my
child
i
came
up
to
ask
you
to
play
over
this
song
but
i
shall
certainly
not
go
now
till
you
told
me
what
the
matter
i
ca
said
dulcie
breaking
down
he
insisted
can
you
shall
i
sure
i
can
help
you
go
on
whether
it
was
his
personality
which
always
had
a
magnetism
for
her
or
the
reaction
of
the
shock
she
had
had
dulcie
actually
told
him
every
word
wondering
at
herself
he
listened
and
then
said
cooly
dear
child
you
making
a
mountain
out
of
a
molehill
people
must
worry
about
trifles
just
before
the
war
i
won
a
lot
of
money
at
monte
carlo
i
simply
do
know
what
to
do
with
it
stop
he
said
as
she
began
to
speak
want
a
hundred
and
ten
pounds
you
shall
have
it
in
i
shall
go
straight
back
to
claridge
in
a
taxi
write
a
cheque
get
it
changed
for
you
wo
know
what
to
do
with
a
cheque
or
at
any
rate
it
would
give
you
more
trouble
and
send
you
the
money
straight
back
by
my
servant
or
my
secretary
in
a
taxi
he
stood
up
another
word
my
dear
miss
clay
do
attach
so
much
importance
to
money
it
would
be
a
bore
for
you
to
have
to
bother
lady
conroy
i
understand
do
imagine
you
under
any
obligation
you
can
pay
it
me
back
just
whenever
you
like
and
i
shall
give
it
to
the
war
emergency
concerts
now
do
be
grateful
we
friends
too
kind
she
answered
he
hurried
to
the
door
my
secretary
comes
back
she
will
ask
to
see
you
if
anyone
knows
you
have
a
visitor
say
i
sent
you
the
music
or
tickets
for
the
concert
cheer
up
now
in
an
hour
from
the
time
valdez
had
come
in
to
see
her
father
and
stepmother
had
each
received
the
money
the
situation
was
saved
dulcie
marvelled
at
the
action
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
done
but
none
who
knew
valdez
well
would
have
been
in
the
least
surprised
he
was
the
most
generous
of
men
and
particularly
he
could
not
bear
to
see
a
pretty
girl
in
sincere
distress
through
no
fault
of
her
own
it
was
dulcie
simple
sincerity
that
pleased
him
he
came
across
very
little
of
it
in
his
own
world
that
world
was
brilliant
distinguished
sometimes
artistic
sometimes
merely
but
it
was
seldom
sincere
he
liked
that
quality
best
of
all
he
certainly
was
gifted
with
it
himself
from
this
time
though
valdez
still
encouraged
dulcie
to
sing
and
occasionally
accompanied
her
the
slight
tinge
of
flirtation
vanished
from
his
manner
she
felt
he
was
only
a
friend
did
she
ever
regret
it
perhaps
a
little
chapter
xxix
said
edith
just
had
a
letter
from
aylmer
from
eastcliff
yes
said
bruce
him
off
to
the
seaside
at
last
did
they
it
was
a
sunday
afternoon
bruce
was
sitting
in
a
melancholy
attitude
on
a
sofa
in
edith
boudoir
he
held
weekly
in
his
hand
and
was
shaking
his
head
over
a
pessimistic
article
when
his
wife
came
in
bruce
was
always
depressed
now
and
if
he
felt
a
little
more
cheerful
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
try
and
conceal
it
no
doubt
his
melancholy
was
real
enough
but
it
was
also
partly
a
pose
and
a
profession
having
undertaken
to
be
depressed
he
seemed
to
think
it
wrong
to
show
a
gleam
of
brightness
besides
on
sundays
madame
frabelle
usually
listened
to
him
and
this
afternoon
she
had
gone
unaccompanied
to
hear
the
rev
byrne
fraser
preach
bruce
felt
injured
he
had
grown
to
feel
quite
lost
without
her
very
dull
there
said
edith
dare
say
he
is
he
answered
sure
should
feel
half
inclined
to
cut
my
throat
if
i
were
alone
with
a
game
leg
at
a
place
like
that
besides
they
had
the
zepps
there
already
once
just
the
place
for
them
to
come
again
very
bored
but
he
much
better
and
he
going
back
to
the
front
in
a
fortnight
a
fortnight
good
heavens
pretty
sharp
work
is
indeed
he
counting
the
hours
till
he
can
get
off
bruce
sighing
lighted
his
cigarette
wondered
if
you
mind
bruce
if
i
went
down
for
the
day
to
see
him
oh
no
of
course
go
i
think
it
your
duty
poor
old
chap
i
wondered
you
did
run
down
for
the
weekend
did
like
to
do
that
she
said
on
earth
not
said
bruce
luck
for
a
poor
chap
with
to
speak
to
going
back
again
so
soon
too
if
you
do
mind
i
go
down
tomorrow
for
a
couple
of
days
and
take
dilly
said
bruce
eagerly
the
kid
good
edith
looked
at
him
closely
you
miss
her
now
that
archie
at
school
too
would
the
house
seem
very
quiet
a
bit
exclaimed
bruce
with
emphatic
sincerity
the
least
bit
in
the
world
at
least
of
course
the
house
seem
quiet
but
that
just
what
i
like
i
for
quiet
yearn
for
it
you
half
understand
my
condition
of
health
edith
the
quieter
i
am
the
less
worried
the
better
of
course
take
dilly
i
you
to
go
right
i
go
tomorrow
morning
till
tuesday
or
wednesday
but
would
it
seem
the
least
bit
rude
to
madame
frabelle
she
talks
of
going
away
soon
you
know
she
wo
mind
said
bruce
decidedly
should
bother
about
her
we
never
treat
her
with
ceremony
when
a
little
bit
later
madame
frabelle
came
in
with
a
slight
perfume
of
incense
about
her
and
very
full
of
a
splendidly
depressing
sermon
she
had
heard
she
heartily
agreed
with
bruce
they
both
persuaded
edith
to
run
down
on
the
monday
and
stay
till
wednesday
evening
at
least
we
shall
never
meet
again
said
bruce
pleasantly
as
edith
dilly
and
the
nurse
were
starting
the
zeppelins
may
come
while
you
away
or
they
may
set
your
hotel
at
eastcliff
on
fire
just
the
place
for
them
if
you
want
me
you
only
to
telephone
and
i
can
be
back
in
a
little
more
than
an
hour
madame
frabelle
accompanied
edith
to
the
station
she
said
to
her
on
the
way
you
know
edith
i
half
expecting
a
telegram
which
may
take
me
away
i
have
a
relative
who
is
anxious
for
me
to
go
and
stay
with
her
an
aunt
but
even
if
i
did
go
perhaps
you
let
me
come
back
to
you
after
edith
assented
somehow
she
did
not
much
believe
either
in
the
telegram
nor
the
relative
she
thought
that
her
friend
talked
like
that
so
as
to
give
the
impression
that
she
was
not
a
fixture
that
she
was
much
sought
after
and
had
many
friends
one
or
two
of
whom
might
insist
on
her
leaving
the
ottleys
soon
aylmer
was
at
the
little
eastcliff
station
to
meet
them
except
that
he
walked
with
the
help
of
a
stick
he
seemed
well
and
having
put
dilly
the
nurse
and
the
luggage
in
a
cab
he
proposed
to
edith
to
walk
to
the
hotel
angelic
of
you
edith
how
jolly
the
child
looks
like
a
live
doll
did
mind
my
bringing
her
i
devoted
to
her
but
you
know
i
hope
it
was
done
for
any
conventional
reasons
headley
and
i
are
in
the
annexe
nearly
from
you
know
said
edith
when
you
see
the
people
here
my
dear
nobody
on
earth
that
counts
or
matters
people
whom
you
never
seen
before
and
never
will
again
but
i
been
counting
the
minutes
till
you
came
it
really
is
a
bad
little
hole
he
took
her
down
to
a
winding
path
covered
in
under
trees
which
led
to
the
sea
by
steps
cut
in
the
rock
they
sat
down
on
a
bench
the
sea
air
was
fresh
and
soothing
is
where
i
sit
and
read
and
think
about
you
well
edith
are
you
going
to
put
me
out
of
my
suspense
how
much
longer
am
i
to
suffer
let
me
look
at
you
she
looked
up
at
him
he
smiled
at
what
he
saw
be
rather
jolly
to
have
two
days
or
so
here
all
to
ourselves
he
said
it
will
be
far
from
jolly
unless
you
give
me
that
promise
does
the
promise
refer
to
after
you
come
back
again
she
said
in
a
low
voice
do
ask
you
to
come
away
until
i
back
again
but
i
want
you
to
promise
before
that
you
will
nothing
more
was
said
on
the
subject
at
the
time
but
after
dinner
when
dilly
had
been
put
to
bed
it
was
so
warm
that
they
could
come
out
again
and
then
she
said
do
worry
yourself
any
more
i
mean
to
do
it
do
he
looked
at
her
ecstatically
edith
i
too
happy
do
you
quite
realise
dear
what
it
is
i
been
waiting
for
you
for
four
years
ever
since
that
night
i
met
you
at
the
mitchells
do
you
know
that
before
the
war
when
i
came
into
that
money
i
was
wild
with
rage
it
seemed
so
wasted
on
me
i
had
no
use
for
it
then
and
when
i
first
met
you
i
used
to
long
for
it
i
hated
being
hard
up
the
first
time
i
had
a
gleam
of
hope
was
when
they
told
me
i
got
over
the
operation
all
right
i
could
believe
my
life
would
be
spared
for
nothing
and
now
you
wo
change
your
mind
again
edith
convinced
him
that
she
would
not
they
sat
hand
in
hand
perhaps
as
near
perfect
happiness
as
two
human
beings
can
be
shall
never
be
happier
than
we
are
now
said
edith
in
a
low
voice
sha
we
he
said
rot
what
about
our
life
when
i
come
back
again
every
dream
realised
yet
your
going
to
risk
it
said
edith
that
nothing
i
shall
come
back
like
a
bad
penny
you
worry
edith
say
you
mean
it
i
mean
what
you
love
me
you
marry
me
you
and
the
children
will
belong
to
me
you
wo
have
any
regrets
swear
you
wo
have
any
regrets
and
remorse
never
will
you
know
aylmer
i
am
like
that
most
women
know
what
they
want
till
they
got
it
and
then
they
want
something
else
but
when
i
get
what
i
want
i
do
regret
it
know
my
darling
sensible
angel
edith
to
think
this
might
have
happened
three
years
ago
then
i
have
had
regrets
only
thought
so
he
answered
should
have
made
you
forget
them
very
soon
do
you
feel
my
dear
that
we
made
for
each
other
i
know
it
how
shall
i
be
able
to
bear
your
going
out
again
it
will
be
like
a
horrible
nightmare
and
perhaps
all
we
both
gone
through
may
be
for
nothing
now
i
got
your
promise
everything
will
be
all
right
i
feel
i
shall
come
back
all
right
look
here
darling
you
need
not
be
unhappy
with
bruce
we
not
going
to
deceive
him
and
when
i
come
back
we
tell
him
not
till
then
there
is
really
no
need
they
walked
together
to
the
annexe
which
was
entered
by
a
small
flight
of
stone
steps
from
the
garden
here
aylmer
had
a
little
suite
of
rooms
edith
went
into
the
with
him
and
looked
round
ten
and
you
here
for
your
health
call
headley
and
go
to
bed
there
a
good
boy
he
held
both
her
hands
must
ask
you
to
stay
with
dilly
here
and
bruce
let
me
come
down
to
look
after
you
he
was
quite
nice
about
it
right
dear
all
right
i
know
no
i
looking
forward
to
when
i
come
back
go
dear
go
edith
walked
very
slowly
down
the
steps
again
he
followed
her
back
into
the
garden
suppose
you
did
come
back
she
said
in
a
very
low
voice
aylmer
glanced
round
there
was
in
the
garden
on
my
honour
here
he
said
dear
go
go
in
to
dilly
he
gave
her
a
little
push
kiss
said
edith
he
smiled
girl
i
told
you
before
that
a
thing
i
ca
do
i
really
ought
to
be
alone
with
you
at
all
until
we
quite
free
i
feel
we
engaged
said
edith
simply
it
wrong
to
kiss
your
fiancée
of
course
we
engaged
wrong
of
course
it
not
wrong
only
i
have
got
the
i
do
believe
you
made
of
ice
edith
i
often
thought
so
said
edith
dare
say
you
right
aylmer
laughed
good
night
my
darling
do
catch
cold
and
edith
aylmer
meet
you
here
at
nine
tomorrow
morning
aylmer
you

back
in
the
afternoon

wo
do
for
you
to
stay
another
night
here
oh
edith
how
happy
we
be
he
watched
her
as
she
walked
across
the
garden
and
went
into
the
hotel
at
the
front
door
then
he
went
indoors
the
next
day
edith
dilly
and
the
nurse
went
back
to
london
early
in
the
afternoon
chapter
xxx
edith
during
the
short
journey
home
sat
with
a
smile
on
her
lips
thinking
of
a
little
scene
she
had
seen
before
leaving
eastcliff
from
the
hall
known
as
the
lounge
of
the
hotel
she
had
watched
dilly
beaming
with
joy
playing
with
a
particularly
large
bright
rose
colour
that
aylmer
had
bought
her
from
a
character
of
the
place
a
very
old
woman
who
made
her
living
by
the
sale
of
these
balloons
dilly
was
enchanted
with
it
she
had
said
to
aylmer
when
the
old
woman
passed
with
a
quantity
of
them
look
like
flowers
they
ought
to
have
a
pretty
scent
which
amused
him
immensely
as
she
held
it
in
her
hand
pressing
it
with
her
tiny
finger
a
tragedy
happened
the
burst
edith
could
hardly
help
laughing
at
seeing
dilly
expression
it
was
despair
gradual
horror
shock
her
first
disillusion
then
as
tears
were
welling
up
in
the
large
blue
eyes
she
was
saying
it
dead
edith
saw
aylmer
snatch
the
collapsed
wreck
from
the
child
hand
and
run
as
fast
as
he
could
which
was
not
very
fast
and
only
when
leaning
on
a
stick
after
the
old
woman
he
caught
her
as
she
turned
the
corner
brought
back
a
pink
and
a
blue
and
gave
them
to
dilly
one
for
each
hand
the
child
beamed
again
happier
than
at
first
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
how
touched
and
delighted
edith
was
would
bruce
have
done
such
a
thing
aylmer
had
so
thoroughly
appreciated
the
little
drama
of
joy
disillusion
and
consolation
shown
in
the
expression
in
lovely
little
face
had
anything
been
wanting
to
edith
resolution
this
small
incident
would
have
decided
it
when
they
arrived
home
a
day
sooner
than
they
were
expected
the
servant
told
edith
at
the
door
that
madame
frabelle
had
gone
away
without
seeing
me
madam
a
telegram
came
for
her
and
she
left
last
night
here
is
a
letter
for
you
madam
edith
ran
into
the
and
tore
it
open
dearest
edith
it
said
my
great
regret
a
wire
i
half
expected
came
and
i
was
compelled
to
leave
before
your
return
to
join
my
relative
who
is
ill
i
ca
tell
you
how
sorry
i
am
not
to
say
and
thank
you
for
your
dear
kind
hospitality
but
i
write
again
a
long
letter
i
hope
also
to
see
you
later
i
will
give
you
my
address
next
time
i
say
one
word
i
ca
say
half
enough
of
my
gratitude
for
your
kindness
and
friendship
but
apart
from
that
may
i
mention
that
i
fear
your
husband
very
unwell
his
nerves
are
in
a
terrible
state
and
i
think
his
condition
is
more
serious
than
you
suppose
he
should
be
humoured
in
everything
not
worried
and
allowed
to
do
whatever
he
likes
do
oppose
any
of
his
wishes
dear
i
say
this
for
your
and
his
own
good
do
be
angry
with
him
or
anybody
never
think
me
wanting
in
gratitude
and
friendship
i
am
still
your
affectionate
friend
what
a
strange
letter
how
like
her
to
lay
down
the
law
about
bruce
it
irritated
edith
a
little
also
it
made
the
future
seem
harder
about
four
landi
called
unexpectedly
he
always
came
just
when
edith
wanted
him
most
and
now
she
confided
in
him
and
told
him
of
her
promise
to
aylmer
he
approved
of
their
resolution
to
wait
till
aylmer
returned
from
the
front
and
to
have
nothing
on
their
conscience
before
he
was
indeed
much
relieved
at
the
postponement
how
is
the
spanish
girl
he
asked
does
she
get
on
with
lady
conroy
all
right
she
not
spanish
at
all
she
had
rather
a
blow
last
week
poor
girl
her
father
nearly
went
bankrupt
she
was
quite
in
despair
it
seems
your
friend
valdez
came
to
the
rescue
in
the
most
generous
way
and
she
immensely
grateful
helped
her
did
he
said
landi
smiling
seems
to
have
behaved
most
generously
and
charmingly
do
you
think
he
is
in
love
with
her
landi
likely
he
will
be
now
she
she
adores
aylmer
will
she
fall
in
love
with
valdez
out
of
gratitude
probable
à

mon

where
is
madame
frabelle
asked
landi
edith
looked
at
the
postmark
she
at
liverpool
of
all
places
but
she
may
be
going
somewhere
else
i
have
got
her
address
she
says
she
write
ça
when
does
aylmer
return
to
the
front
goes
before
the
board
tomorrow
and
will
know
then
that
evening
when
bruce
came
in
edith
was
struck
by
his
paleness
and
depression
and
she
began
to
think
madame
frabelle
was
right
he
must
be
really
then
if
he
was
could
she
later
be
so
cruel
as
to
leave
him
she
was
in
doubt
again
bad
news
in
the
evening
papers
he
said
it
so
bad
said
bruce
rather
solemnly
without
listening
want
to
speak
to
you
after
dinner
i
have
something
serious
to
say
to
you
really
edith
wondered
could
bruce
suspect
anything
but
apparently
he
did
since
he
spoke
in
a
very
friendly
way
of
aylmer
saying
that
he
hoped
he
would
stop
away
long
the
dinner
passed
in
trivial
conversation
she
described
eastcliff
the
hotel
the
people
bruce
appeared
after
dinner
she
went
to
join
him
in
the
library
where
he
was
smoking
and
said
bruce
what
is
it
you
have
to
say
to
me
heavens
said
bruce
looking
at
his
i
spoken
of
this
once
i
spoken
of
it
forty
times
the
inkstand
is
too
full
i
so
dreadfully
sorry
said
edith
feeling
the
strangeness
of
bruce
want
of
sense
of
proportion
he
had
as
it
seemed
to
speak
to
her
about
some
important
matter
yet
the
inkstand
being
too
full
attracted
his
attention
roused
his
anger
she
remembered
he
had
said
these
very
words
the
day
he
came
back
from
his
elopement
with
the
art
student
edith
looked
round
the
room
while
bruce
smoked
and
so
she
had
really
made
up
her
mind
she
to
leave
him
not
that
she
intended
to
see
aylmer
again
now
except
once
perhaps
to
say
but
still
she
really
intended
to
change
her
whole
life
when
he
returned
again
she
felt
rather
but
was
glad
when
she
looked
at
bruce
that
there
had
never
been
anything
as
yet
but
platonic
affection
between
her
and
aylmer
which
she
could
have
no
cause
to
blush
for
before
bruce
and
how
grateful
she
felt
to
aylmer
for
his
wonderful
thanks
to
that
she
could
look
bruce
in
the
face
bruce
was
speaking
he
said
with
some
agitation
wish
to
tell
you
something
she
saw
he
looked
pale
and
nervous
is
it
bruce
she
asked
kindly
this
he
said
in
a
somewhat
pompous
tone
am
in
a
very
strange
condition
of
health
i
find
i
can
no
longer
endure
to
live
in
london
i
must
get
away
from
the
war
the
doctor
says
so
if
i
to
keep
sane
if
i
not
to
commit
suicide
i
must
give
up
this
domestic
life
she
stared
at
him
i
sorry
i
tried
to
endure
it
he
went
on
ca
stand
the
responsibility
the
anxiety
of
the
children
and
everything
i
i
going
away
she
said
nothing
looking
at
him
in
silence
i
going
to
america
i
taken
my
passage
i
going
on
friday
i
thought
of
leaving
without
telling
you
but
i
decided
it
was
better
to
be
open
bruce
do
you
mean
for
a
trip
he
stood
up
and
looked
at
her
full
in
the
face
i
do
mean
for
a
trip
i
want
to
live
in
america
you
do
want
me
to
come
too
edith
i
ca
endure
married
life
any
longer
it
does
suit
me
three
years
ago
i
offered
you
your
freedom
and
you
refused
to
take
it
i
offer
it
you
again
now
you
are
older
you
are
perfectly
fit
to
manage
your
life
and
the
children
without
me
i
must
be
free
free
to
look
after
my
health
and
to
get
away
from
everything
mean
to
leave
us
altogether
then
said
edith
feeling
unspeakably
thankful
that
just
what
i
do
mean
will
you
be
happy
comfortable
alone
in
america
he
walked
across
the
room
and
came
back
i
sorry
to
pain
you
but
i
shall
not
be
alone
edith
started
thinking
of
madame
frabelle
letter
from
liverpool
evidently
they
were
going
away
together
course
i
give
up
the
foreign
office
and
my
salary
there
but
you
have
some
money
of
your
own
edith
it
will
be
enough
for
you
and
the
children
to
live
quietly
and
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
afford
to
send
you
part
of
my
income
that
my
father
left
me
when
i
get
something
to
do
over
there
he
added
rather
lamely
mean
to
get
something
to
do
when
i
strong
enough
i
very
ill
very
there
was
a
long
pause
then
edith
said
kindly
you
any
fault
to
find
with
me
bruce
you
are
a
perfect
mother
he
said
in
a
peculiar
tone
which
sounded
to
edith
like
an
echo
of
madame
frabelle
no
fault
to
find
with
you
either
as
a
wife
but
i
not
happy
here
i
miserable
i
implore
you
not
to
make
a
scene
do
oppose
me
forgive
me
on
account
of
my
health
this
will
save
my
life
if
he
only
knew
how
little
she
wished
to
oppose
him
she
stood
up
you
shall
do
exactly
as
you
like
he
looked
enchanted
relieved
hope
you
will
be
happy
and
well
and
i
shall
try
to
be
may
i
just
ask
is
madame
frabelle
going
to
america
i
will
not
deny
it
we
mean
to
throw
in
our
lot
together
look
out
you
have
the
inkstand
over
she
had
moved
near
the
edith
stopped
herself
from
a
hysterical
laugh
wo
mind
if
i
go
down
to
the
club
for
an
hour
not
edith
say
what
you
can
to
my
mother
and
comfort
her
tell
her
it
to
save
my
going
off
my
head
or
committing
suicide
will
you
say
that
will
she
replied
five
minutes
later
the
door
banged
bruce
had
gone
to
the
club
he
had
told
her
he
had
taken
a
room
there
and
the
same
evening
he
sent
up
for
his
luggage
he
did
not
wish
to
see
edith
again
just
before
he
went
out
as
if
casually
for
an
hour
at
the
club
edith
had
said
you
like
to
come
and
see
dilly
asleep
it
had
occurred
to
her
that
at
least
he
had
been
frank
and
honest
and
for
that
he
deserved
to
see
dilly
again
my
nerves
wo
stand
scenes
i
better
not
i
wo
see
her
very
well
she
cried
indignantly
offered
it
for
your
sake
i
would
rather
you
see
her
not
to
be
angry
edith
perhaps
some
day
never
would
never
let
me
come
back
again
to
see
you
all
never
nothing
you
need
be
so
cross
remember
my
health
do
said
edith
edith
bruce
forget
about
that
inkstand
will
you
it
always
filled
just
a
little
too
full
it
it
very
awkward
remember
about
it
wo
you
good
night
night
and
bruce
went
to
the
club
the
next
day
edith
felt
she
could
neither
write
nor
telephone
to
aylmer
just
once
only
once
for
a
long
time
she
must
see
him
she
confided
in
landi
who
invited
them
both
to
tea
at
his
studio
for
once
only
and
was
urgent
in
impressing
patience
on
them
when
edith
arrived
with
this
thrilling
piece
of
news
to
announce
she
found
aylmer
alone
in
the
pretty
white
studio
landi
was
expected
back
every
moment
from
a
lesson
at
a
pupil
house
aylmer
was
beaming
with
joy
my
dear
he
cried
not
going
away
at
all
they
wo
have
me
they
given
me
an
appointment
at
the
war
office
aylmer
how
wonderful
i
know
now
i
could
have
borne
your
going
out
again
now
he
put
his
arm
round
her
ah
this
she
felt
was
real
love
it
wrapped
her
round
it
lifted
her
off
her
feet
now
aylmer
we
must
meet
for
a
long
time
why
not
what
is
it
something
has
happened
i
need
keep
my
promise
now

you
mean

to
