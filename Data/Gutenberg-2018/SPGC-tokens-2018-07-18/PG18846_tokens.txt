was
more
than
just
a
head
it
was
a
graceful
body
fully
eight
feet
in
length
and
the
red
eyes
in
the
head
were
those

killer

curved

dane
slid
his
blade
out

setting
its
point
against
the
palm
of
his

and
jabbing
painfully

all

features
of
a
steam
bath
and
one
could
only
dream
of
coolness
greenness
more
land
than
a
stingy
string
of
islands
the
young
man
on
the
promontory
above
the
crash
of
the
waves
wore
the
winged
cap
of
a
spaceman
with
the
insignia
of
a
and
not
much
else
save
a
pair
of
very
short
shorts
he
wiped
one
hand
absently
across
his
bare
chest
and
brought
it
away
damp
as
he
studied
through
protective
sun
goggles
the
treacherous
promise
of
the
bright
sea
one
swim
if
he
wanted

of

thorson
licked
his
own
lips
tasting
salt
and
plodded
back
through

sand
of
the

to
the
berth
of
the
this
had
been
a
long
day
and
one
with
more
than
he
cared
to
count
keeping
him
on
a
constant
dogged
trot
between
the
ship
and
the
fitting
yard
where
riggers
labored
with
the
slowest
motions
possible
to
the
human
body
or
so
it
seemed
to
the
exasperated
of
the
free
trader
captain
jellico
had
long
ago
taken
refuge
in
his
cabin
to
preserve
the
remnants
of
his
temper
dane
had
been
allowed
no
such
escape
the
had
a
schedule
for
refitting
to
serve
as
a
mail
ship
and
that
time
allowance
did
not
allow
for
humidity
playing
the
devil
with
the
innards
of
robot
fitters
she
to
be
ready
to
lift
when
the
combine
ship
now
plying
that
run
set
down
and
formally
signed
off
in
her
favor
luckily
most
of
the
work
was
done
and
dane
had
given
a
last
searching
inspection
before
signing
the
rigger
book
and
reporting
to
his
captain
the
interior
of
the
comforted
him
as
he
climbed
to
his
quarters
ship
air
was
flat
chemically
pure
but
unappetizing
stuff
today
it
was
a
relief
to
breathe
dane
went
on
to
the
bather
at
least
there
was
no
lack
of
water
with
the
local
skinners
filtered
out
it
was
chill
but
relaxing
on
his
gaunt
young
body
he
was
sealing
on
his
lightest
tunic
when
the
ramp
buzzer
sounded
a
visitor
oh
not
the
again
dane
went
to
answer
with
dragging
feet
for
the
crew
of
the
at
the
moment
numbered
exactly
four
with
himself
for
general
errand
boy
captain
jellico
was
in
his
quarters
two
levels
above
medic
tau
was
presumably
overhauling
his
supplies
and
sindbad
ship
cat
asleep
in
some
empty
cabin
dane
jerked
his
tunic
into
place
very
much
on
his
guard
as
he
came
to
the
head
of
the
ramp
but
it
was
not
the
dane
thoroughly
used
to
strangers
both
human
and
alien
was
impressed
by
this
visitor
he
was
tall
this
quiet
man
his
great
height
accented
by
a
fit
leanness
a
narrowness
of
waist
and
hip
a
length
of
leg
and
arm
his
main
article
of
clothing
was
the
universal
shorts
of
the
xecho
settler
but
being
fashioned
of
saffron
yellow
they
were
the
more
brilliant
because
of
his
darkness
of
skin
for
he
was
not
the
warm
brown
of
the
terran
negroes
dane
had
served
beside
though
he
shared
their
general
features
his
flesh
was
really
black
black
with
an
almost
bluish
sheen
instead
of
shirt
or
tunic
his
deep
chest
was
crossed
by
two
wide
straps
the
big
medallion
marking
their
intersection
giving
forth
flashes
of
gem
fire
when
he
breathed
he
wore
at
his
belt
not
the
standard
stun
gun
of
a
spaceman
but
a
weapon
which
resembled
the
more
deadly
patrol
blaster
as
well
as
a
long
knife
housed
in
a
jeweled
and
fringed
sheath
to
the
eye
he
was
an
example
of
barbaric
force
tamed
and
trimmed
to
civilized
efficiency
he
saluted
palm
out
and
spoke
galactic
basic
with
only
a
suggestion
of
accent
i
am
kort
asaki
i
believe
captain
jellico
expects
me
yes
sir
dane
snapped
to
attention
so
this
was
the
chief
ranger
from
fabulous
khatka
xecho
sister
planet
the
other
ascended
the
cat
ladder
easily
missing
no
detail
of
the
ship
interior
as
he
passed
his
expression
was
still
one
of
polite
interest
as
his
guide
rapped
on
the
panel
door
of
jellico
cabin
and
a
horrible
screech
from
queex
the
captain
pet
hoobat
drowned
out
any
immediate
answer
then
followed
that
automatic
thump
on
the
floor
of
the
cage
announcing
that
its
master
was
in
residence
since
the
captain
cordial
welcome
extended
only
to
his
guest
dane
regretfully
descended
to
the
mess
cabin
to
make
unskilled
preparations
for
supper
though
there
was
not
much
you
could
do
to
foul
up
concentrates
in
an
automatic
cooker
company
tau
sat
beyond
the
cooking
unit
nursing
a
mug
of
terran
coffee
and
do
you
to
serve
music
with
the
meals
especially
that
particular
selection
dane
flushed
stopped
whistling
in
terra
bound
old
and
pretty
well
worn
out
he
did
know
why
he
always
unconsciously
sounded
off
with
that
a
chief
ranger
from
khatka
just
came
on
board
he
reported
carefully
offhand
as
he
busied
himself
reading
labels
he
knew
better
than
to
serve
fish
or
any
of
its
derivatives
in
disguise
again
khatka
tau
sat
up
straighter
now
there
a
planet
worth
visiting
not
on
a
free
trader
pay
commented
dane
you
can
always
hope
to
make
a
big
strike
boy
but
what
i
would
give
to
lift
ship
for
there
why
you
no
hunter
how
come
you
want
to
heat
jets
for
that
port
oh
i
do
care
about
the
game
preserves
though
they
worth
seeing
too
it
the
people
themselves
but
they
terran
settlers
or
at
least
from
terran
stock
they
sure
tau
sipped
his
coffee
slowly
but
there
are
settlers
and
settlers
son
and
a
lot
depends
upon
when
they
left
terra
and
why
and
who
they
were
also
what
happened
to
them
after
they
landed
out
here
and
khatkans
are
really
special
well
they
have
an
amazing
history
the
colony
was
founded
by
escaped
prisoners
and
just
one
racial
stock
they
took
off
from
earth
close
to
the
end
of
the
second
atomic
war
that
was
a
race
war
remember
which
made
it
doubly
ugly
tau
mouth
twisted
in
disgust
as
if
the
color
of
a
man
skin
makes
any
difference
in
what
lies
under
it
one
side
in
that
tried
to
take
over
africa
herded
most
of
the
natives
into
a
giant
concentration
camp
and
practiced
genocide
on
a
grand
scale
then
they
were
cracked
themselves
hard
and
heavy
during
the
confusion
some
survivors
in
the
camp
staged
a
revolt
helped
by
the
enemy
they
captured
an
experimental
station
hidden
in
the
center
of
the
camp
and
made
a
break
into
space
in
two
ships
which
had
been
built
there
that
voyage
must
have
been
a
nightmare
but
they
were
desperate
somehow
they
made
it
out
here
to
the
rim
and
set
down
on
khatka
without
power
enough
to
take
off
again
and
by
then
most
of
them
were
dead
but
we
humans
no
matter
what
our
race
are
a
tough
breed
the
refugees
discovered
that
climatically
their
new
world
was
not
too
different
from
africa
a
lucky
chance
which
might
happen
only
once
in
a
thousand
times
so
they
thrived
the
handful
who
survived
but
the
white
technicians
they
had
kidnaped
to
run
the
ships
did
for
they
set
up
a
color
bar
in
reverse
the
lighter
your
skin
the
lower
you
were
in
the
social
scale
by
that
kind
of
selective
breeding
the
present
khatkans
are
very
dark
indeed
they
reverted
to
the
primitive
for
survival
then
about
two
hundred
years
ago
long
before
the
first
survey
scout
discovered
them
something
happened
either
the
parent
race
mutated
or
as
sometimes
occurs
a
line
of
people
of
superior
gifts
emerged
not
in
a
few
isolated
births
but
with
surprising
regularity
in
five
family
clans
there
was
a
short
period
of
power
struggle
until
they
realized
the
foolishness
of
civil
war
and
formed
an
oligarchy
heading
a
loose
tribal
organization
with
the
five
families
to
push
and
lead
a
new
civilization
developed
and
when
survey
came
to
call
they
were
no
longer
savages
combine
bought
the
trade
rights
about
years
ago
then
the
company
and
the
five
families
got
together
and
marketed
a
luxury
item
to
the
galaxy
you
know
how
every
big
shot
on
planets
wants
to
say
hunted
on
khatka
and
if
he
can
point
out
a
graz
head
on
his
wall
or
wear
a
tail
bracelet
he
able
to
strut
with
the
best
to
holiday
on
khatka
is
both
fabulous
and
fashionable
and
very
very
profitable
for
the
natives
and
for
combine
who
sells
transportation
to
the
travelers
i
hear
they
have
poachers
too
dane
remarked
yes
that
naturally
follows
you
know
what
a
glam
skin
brings
on
the
market
wherever
you
have
a
rigidly
controlled
export
you
going
to
have
poachers
and
smugglers
but
the
patrol
does
go
to
khatka
the
natives
handle
their
own
criminals
personally
i
cheerfully
take
a
sentence
in
the
lunar
mines
in
place
of
what
the
khatkans
dish
out
to
a
poacher
they
net
so
that
rumor
has
spread
satisfactorily
coffee
slopped
over
the
brim
of
tau
mug
and
dane
dropped
the
packet
of
steak
concentrate
he
was
about
to
feed
into
the
cooker
chief
ranger
asaki
loomed
in
the
doorway
of
the
mess
as
suddenly
as
if
he
had
been
teleported
to
that
point
the
medic
arose
to
his
feet
and
smiled
politely
at
the
visitor
do
i
detect
in
that
observation
sir
the
suggestion
that
the
tales
i
have
heard
were
deliberately
set
to
blast
where
they
would
do
the
most
good
as
deterrents
a
fleeting
grin
broke
the
impassive
somberness
of
the
black
face
i
was
informed
you
are
a
man
skilled
in
medic
you
certainly
display
the
traditional
sorcerer
quickness
of
wit
but
this
rumor
is
also
truth
the
quirk
of
good
humor
had
gone
again
and
there
was
an
edge
in
the
chief
ranger
voice
which
cut
poachers
on
khatka
would
welcome
the
patrol
in
place
of
the
attention
they
now
receive
he
came
into
the
mess
cabin
jellico
behind
him
and
dane
pulled
down
two
of
the
snap
seats
he
was
holding
a
mug
under
the
spout
of
the
coffee
dispenser
as
the
captain
made
introductions
thorson
our
thorson
the
khatkan
acknowledged
with
a
grave
nod
of
his
head
and
then
glanced
down
to
floor
level
with
a
look
of
surprise
weaving
a
pattern
about
his
legs
purring
loudly
sindbad
was
offering
an
unusually
fervent
welcome
of
his
own
the
ranger
went
down
on
one
knee
his
hand
out
for
sindbad
inquiring
sniff
then
the
cat
butted
that
dark
palm
batted
at
it
playfully
with
paw
a
terran
cat
it
is
of
the
lion
family
far
removed
jellico
supplied
you
have
to
add
a
lot
of
bulk
to
sindbad
to
promote
him
to
the
lion
class
we
have
only
the
old
tales
asaki
sounded
almost
wistful
as
the
cat
jumped
to
his
knee
and
clawed
for
a
hold
on
his
chest
belts
but
i
do
not
believe
that
lions
were
ever
so
friendly
toward
my
ancestors
dane
would
have
removed
the
cat
but
the
khatkan
arose
with
sindbad
still
purring
loudly
resting
in
the
crook
of
his
arm
the
ranger
was
smiling
with
a
gentleness
which
changed
the
whole
arrogant
cast
of
his
countenance
do
not
bring
this
one
to
khatka
with
you
captain
or
you
will
never
take
him
away
again
those
who
dwell
in
the
inner
courts
would
not
let
him
vanish
from
their
sight
ah
so
this
pleases
you
small
lion
he
rubbed
sindbad
gently
under
the
throat
and
the
cat
stretched
his
neck
his
yellow
eyes
half
closed
in
bliss
thorson
the
captain
turned
to
dane
that
arrival
report
on
my
desk
was
the
final
one
from
combine
yes
sir
there
no
hope
of
the
setting
down
here
before
that
date
asaki
sat
down
still
holding
the
cat
so
you
see
captain
fortune
has
arranged
it
all
you
have
two
tens
of
days
four
days
to
go
in
my
cruiser
four
days
for
your
return
here
and
the
rest
to
explore
the
preserve
we
could
not
ask
for
better
luck
for
i
do
not
know
when
our
paths
may
cross
again
in
the
normal
course
of
events
i
will
not
have
another
mission
to
xecho
for
a
year
perhaps
longer
also
he
hesitated
and
then
spoke
to
tau
medic
captain
jellico
has
informed
me
that
you
have
made
a
study
of
magic
on
many
worlds
that
is
so
sir
do
you
then
believe
that
it
is
real
force
or
that
it
is
only
a
superstition
for
who
set
up
demons
to
howl
petitions
to
when
some
darkness
falls
upon
them
some
of
the
magic
i
have
seen
is
trickery
some
of
it
founded
upon
an
inner
knowledge
of
men
and
their
ways
which
a
shrewd
witch
doctor
can
use
to
his
advantage
there
always
remains
tau
put
down
his
mug
there
always
remains
a
small
residue
of
happenings
and
results
for
which
we
have
not
yet
found
any
logical
explanations
and
i
believe
asaki
interrupted
it
is
also
true
that
a
race
can
be
conditioned
from
birth
to
be
sensitive
to
forms
of
magic
so
that
men
of
that
blood
are
particularly
susceptible
that
was
more
of
a
statement
than
a
question
but
tau
answered
it
that
is
very
true
a
lamorian
for
example
can
be
to
death
i
have
witnessed
such
a
case
but
upon
a
terran
or
another
man
the
same
suggestion
would
have
no
effect
those
who
settled
khatka
brought
such
magic
with
them
the
chief
ranger
fingers
still
moved
about
sindbad
jaw
and
throat
soothingly
but
his
tone
was
chill
the
coldest
thing
in
the
cramped
space
of
the
mess
cabin
yes
a
highly
developed
form
of
it
tau
agreed
more
highly
developed
perhaps
than
even
you
can
believe
medic
that
came
in
a
hiss
of
cold
rage
i
think
that
its
present
manifestation
death
by
a
beast
that
is
not
a
beast
could
be
worth
your
detailed
study
why
tau
came
bluntly
to
the
point
because
it
is
a
killing
magic
and
it
is
being
carefully
used
to
rid
my
world
of
key
men
men
we
need
badly
if
there
is
a
weak
point
in
this
cloudy
attack
shaping
against
us
we
must
learn
it
and
soon
it
was
jellico
who
added
the
rest
we
are
invited
to
visit
khatka
and
survey
a
new
hunting
range
as
chief
ranger
asaki
personal
term
guests
dane
drew
a
deep
breath
of
wonder
guest
rights
on
khatka
were
jealously
guarded
they
were
too
valuable
to
their
owners
to
waste
whole
families
lived
on
the
income
from
the
yearly
rental
of
even
half
a
one
but
the
rangers
by
right
of
office
had
several
which
they
could
grant
to
visiting
scientists
or
men
from
other
worlds
holding
positions
similar
to
their
own
to
have
such
an
opportunity
offered
to
an
ordinary
trader
was
almost
incredible
his
wonder
was
matched
by
tau
and
must
have
been
plain
to
read
for
the
chief
ranger
smiled
for
a
long
time
captain
jellico
and
i
have
exchanged
biological
data
on
alien
his
skill
in
photographing
such
his
knowledge
as
an
xenobiologist
are
widely
recognized
and
so
i
have
permission
for
him
to
visit
the
new
zoboru
preserve
not
yet
officially
opened
and
you
medic
tau
your
help
or
at
least
your
diagnosis
we
need
in
another
direction
so
one
expert
comes
openly
another
not
so
openly
though
medic
your
task
is
approved
by
my
superiors
and
he
glanced
at
dane
perhaps
to
muddle
the
trail
for
the
suspicious
shall
we
not
ask
this
young
man
also
dane
eyes
went
to
the
captain
jellico
was
always
fair
and
his
crew
would
have
snapped
into
action
on
his
word
alone
even
if
they
were
fronting
a
rain
of
thorkian
death
darts
and
that
order
was
to
advance
but
on
the
other
hand
dane
would
never
have
asked
a
favor
and
the
best
he
hoped
for
was
to
be
able
to
perform
his
duties
without
unfavorable
comment
upon
their
commission
he
had
no
reason
to
believe
jellico
was
willing
to
agree
to
this
you
have
two
weeks
leave
coming
thorson
if
you
want
to
spend
it
on
khatka
jellico
actually
grinned
then
i
take
it
that
you
do
when
do
we
sir
you
said
that
you
must
wait
for
the
return
of
your
other
crew
members
shall
we
say
tomorrow
the
chief
ranger
stood
up
and
put
sindbad
down
though
the
cat
protested
with
several
sharp
meows
small
lion
the
tall
khatkan
spoke
to
the
cat
as
to
an
equal
this
is
your
jungle
and
mine
lies
elsewhere
but
should
you
ever
grow
tired
of
traveling
the
stars
there
is
always
a
home
for
you
in
my
courts
when
the
chief
ranger
went
out
the
door
sindbad
did
not
try
to
follow
but
he
uttered
one
mournful
little
cry
of
protest
and
loss
so
he
wants
a
trouble
shooter
does
he
tau
asked
all
right
try
to
hunt
out
his
goblins
for
him
it
be
worth
that
to
visit
khatka
dane
remembering
the
hot
glare
of
the
xecho
spaceport
the
sea
one
could
not
swim
in
contrasted
that
with
the
he
had
seen
of
the
green
hunters
paradise
on
the
next
planet
of
the
system
yes
sir
he
echoed
and
made
a
haphazard
choice
for
the
cooker
do
be
too
lighthearted
tau
warned
i
say
that
any
stew
which
was
too
hot
for
that
ranger
to
handle
might
give
us
burned
fingers
and
quick
when
we
land
on
khatka
walk
softly
and
look
over
your
shoulder
and
be
prepared
for
the
worst
ii
lightning
played
along
the
black
ridges
above
them
and
below
was
a
sheer
drop
to
a
river
which
was
only
a
silver
thread
under
their
boots
and
yet
dominating
the
wildness
of
jungle
and
mountain
was
a
platform
of
rock
slabs
fused
to
support
a
palace
of
towering
walls
and
curved
cups
of
domes
a
palace
which
was
also
half
fortress
half
frontier
post
dane
set
his
hands
on
the
parapet
of
the
river
drop
blinked
as
a
lightning
bolt
crackled
in
a
glare
of
violet
fire
this
was
about
as
far
from
the
steaming
islands
of
xecho
as
a
man
could
imagine
the
demon
graz
prepare
for
battle
asaki
nodded
toward
the
distant
crackling
captain
jellico
laughed
supposed
to
be
whetting
their
tusks
eh
i
would
care
to
meet
a
graz
that
could
produce
such
a
display
by
mere
tusk
whetting
no
but
think
of
the
reward
for
the
tracker
who
discovers
where
such
go
to
die
to
find
the
graveyard
of
the
graz
herds
would
make
any
man
wealthy
beyond
dreams
how
much
truth
is
there
in
that
legend
tau
asked
the
chief
ranger
shrugged
who
can
say
this
much
true
i
have
served
my
life
in
the
forests
since
i
could
walk
i
have
listened
to
the
talk
of
trackers
hunters
rangers
in
my
father
courtyards
and
field
camps
since
i
could
understand
their
words
yet
never
has
any
man
reported
the
finding
of
a
body
of
a
graz
that
died
a
natural
death
the
scavengers
might
well
account
for
the
bulk
of
flesh
but
the
tusks
and
the
bones
should
be
visible
for
years
and
this
too
i
have
seen
with
my
own
eyes
a
graz
close
to
death
supported
by
two
of
its
kind
and
being
urged
along
to
the
big
swamps
perhaps
it
is
only
that
the
suffering
animal
longs
for
water
at
its
end
or
perhaps
in
the
heart
of
that
morass
there
does
lie
the
graz
graveyard
but
no
man
has
found
a
naturally
dead
graz
nor
has
any
returned
from
exploring
the
big
swamps
lightning
on
peaks
which
were
like
polished
jet
bare
rock
above
the
lush
overgrowth
of
jungle
below
and
between
this
fortress
held
by
men
who
dared
both
the
heights
and
the
depths
the
wildly
burgeoning
life
of
khatka
had
surrounded
the
since
they
had
come
here
there
was
something
untameable
about
khatka
the
lush
planet
lured
and
yet
repelled
at
the
same
time
zoboru
far
from
here
the
chief
ranger
pointed
north
in
answer
to
the
captain
question
about
a
hundred
leagues
it
is
the
first
new
preserve
we
have
prepared
in
ten
years
and
it
is
our
desire
to
make
it
the
best
for
hunters
that
is
why
we
are
now
operating
taming
teams
taming
teams
dane
had
to
ask
the
chief
ranger
was
ready
enough
to
discuss
his
project
zoboru
is
a
preserve
the
animals
they
come
to
learn
that
after
a
while
but
we
can
not
wait
several
years
until
they
do
so
we
make
them
gifts
he
laughed
evidently
recalling
some
incident
sometimes
perhaps
we
are
too
eager
most
of
our
visitors
who
wish
to
make
want
to
picture
big
game
graz
amplet
rock
apes
lions
lions
echoed
dane
not
terran
lions
no
but
my
people
when
they
landed
on
khatka
found
a
few
animals
that
reminded
them
of
those
they
had
always
known
so
they
gave
those
the
same
names
a
khatkan
lion
is
furred
it
is
a
hunter
and
a
great
fighter
but
it
is
not
the
cat
of
terra
however
it
is
in
great
demand
as
a
actor
so
we
summon
it
out
of
lurking
by
providing
free
meals
one
shoots
a
poli
a
water
rat
or
a
landeer
and
drags
the
carcass
behind
a
flitter
the
lion
springs
upon
the
moving
meat
which
it
can
also
scent
and
the
rope
is
cut
leaving
a
free
dinner
the
lions
are
not
stupid
in
a
very
short
time
they
connect
the
sound
of
a
flitter
cutting
the
air
with
food
so
they
come
to
the
banquet
and
those
on
the
flitter
can
take
their
shots
at
ease
only
there
must
also
be
care
taken
in
such
training
one
forest
guard
on
the
komog
preserve
became
too
enterprising
he
dragged
his
kill
at
first
then
to
see
if
he
could
get
the
lions
to
forget
man
presence
entirely
he
hung
the
training
carcasses
on
the
flitter
encouraging
them
to
jump
for
their
food
for
the
guard
that
was
safe
enough
but
it
worked
too
too
well
a
month
or
so
later
a
hunter
was
escorting
a
client
through
komog
and
they
swung
low
to
get
a
good
picture
of
a
water
rat
emerging
from
the
river
suddenly
there
was
a
snarl
behind
them
and
they
found
themselves
sharing
the
flitter
with
a
lioness
annoyed
at
finding
no
meat
waiting
on
board
luckily
they
both
wore
stass
belts
but
they
had
to
land
the
flitter
and
leave
until
the
lioness
wandered
off
and
she
seriously
damaged
the
machine
in
her
irritation
so
now
our
guards
play
no
more
fancy
tricks
while
on
taming
runs
tomorrow
no
he
corrected
himself
the
day
after
tomorrow
i
will
be
able
to
show
you
how
the
process
works
and
tomorrow
inquired
the
captain
tomorrow
my
men
make
hunting
magic
asaki
voice
was
expressionless
your
chief
witch
doctor
being
questioned
tau
lumbrilo
the
chief
ranger
did
not
appear
disposed
to
add
to
that
but
tau
pursued
the
subject
his
office
is
hereditary
yes
does
that
make
any
difference
for
the
first
time
there
was
a
current
of
repressed
eagerness
in
the
other
tone
perhaps
a
vast
amount
of
difference
tau
replied
a
hereditary
office
may
carry
with
it
two
forms
of
conditioning
one
to
influence
its
holder
one
to
affect
the
your
lumbrilo
may
have
come
to
believe
deeply
in
his
own
powers
he
would
be
a
very
remarkable
man
if
he
did
not
it
is
almost
certain
that
your
people
unquestionably
accept
him
as
a
worker
of
wonders
they
do
so
accept
once
more
asaki
voice
was
drained
of
life
and
lumbrilo
does
not
accept
something
you
believe
necessary
again
the
truth
medic
lumbrilo
does
not
accept
his
proper
place
in
the
scheme
of
things
he
is
a
member
of
one
of
your
five
families
no
his
clan
is
small
always
set
apart
from
the
beginning
here
those
who
spoke
for
gods
and
demons
did
not
also
order
men
separation
of
church
and
state
commented
tau
thoughtfully
yet
in
our
terran
past
there
have
been
times
when
church
and
state
were
one
does
lumbrilo
desire
that
asaki
raised
his
eyes
to
the
mountain
peaks
to
the
northward
where
lay
his
beloved
work
i
do
not
know
what
lumbrilo
wants
save
that
it
makes
mischief
or
worse
this
i
tell
you
hunting
magic
is
part
of
our
lives
and
it
has
at
its
core
some
of
those
unexplainable
happenings
which
you
have
acknowledged
do
exist
i
have
used
powers
i
can
neither
explain
nor
understand
as
part
of
my
work
in
the
jungle
and
on
the
grasslands
an
must
guard
his
life
with
a
stass
belt
if
he
goes
unarmed
but
i
any
of
my
men
can
walk
unharmed
if
we
obey
the
rules
of
our
magic
only
lumbrilo
does
other
things
which
his
forefathers
did
not
and
he
boasts
that
he
can
do
more
so
he
has
a
growing
following
of
those
who
believe
and
those
who
fear
you
want
me
to
face
him
the
chief
ranger
big
hands
closed
upon
the
rim
of
the
parapet
as
if
they
could
exert
enough
pressure
to
crumble
the
hard
stone
i
want
you
to
see
whether
there
is
trickery
in
this
trickery
i
can
fight
for
that
there
are
weapons
but
if
lumbrilo
truly
controls
forces
for
which
there
is
no
name
then
perhaps
we
must
patch
up
an
uneasy
peace
or
go
down
in
defeat
and
i
come
from
a
line
of
warriors
we
do
not
drink
defeat
easily
that
i
also
believe
tau
returned
quietly
be
sure
sir
if
there
is
trickery
in
this
man
magic
and
i
can
detect
it
the
secret
shall
be
yours
let
us
hope
that
so
it
shall
be
subconsciously
dane
had
always
associated
the
practice
of
magic
with
darkness
and
the
night
but
the
next
morning
the
sun
was
high
and
hot
when
he
made
one
of
the
party
coming
down
to
a
second
and
larger
walled
terrace
where
the
hunters
trackers
guards
and
other
followers
of
the
chief
ranger
were
assembled
in
irregular
rows
there
was
a
low
sound
which
was
more
a
throb
in
the
clear
air
about
them
getting
into
a
man
blood
and
pumping
in
rhythm
there
dane
tracked
the
sound
to
its
source
four
large
drums
standing
waist
high
before
the
men
who
tapped
them
delicately
with
the
tips
of
all
ten
fingers
the
necklaces
of
claws
and
teeth
about
those
dusky
throats
the
kilts
of
fringed
hide
the
crossed
belts
of
brilliantly
spotted
or
striped
fur
were
in
contrast
to
the
very
efficient
and
modern
side
arms
each
man
wore
to
the
rest
of
the
equipment
sheathed
and
strapped
at
their
belts
there
was
a
carved
stool
for
the
chief
ranger
another
for
captain
jellico
dane
and
tau
settled
themselves
on
the
less
comfortable
seats
of
the
terrace
steps
those
tapping
fingers
increased
their
rate
of
beat
and
the
notes
of
the
drums
rose
from
the
low
murmur
of
hived
bees
to
the
mutter
of
mountain
thunder
still
half
a
range
away
a
bird
called
from
those
inner
courts
of
the
palace
from
which
the
women
never
ventured
da
da
da
da
voices
took
up
the
of
the
drums
the
heads
of
the
squatting
men
moved
in
a
slow
swing
from
side
to
side
tau
hand
closed
about
dane
wrist
and
the
younger
man
looked
around
startled
to
see
that
the
medic
eyes
were
alight
that
he
was
watching
the
assembly
with
the
alertness
of
sindbad
approaching
prey
calculate
the
stowage
space
in
number
one
hold
that
amazing
order
delivered
in
a
whisper
shocked
dane
into
obeying
it
number
one
hold
there
were
three
divisions
now
and
the
stowage
was
he
became
aware
that
for
a
small
space
of
time
he
had
escaped
the
net
being
woven
by
the
beat
of
the
drum
the
drone
of
voices
the
nodding
of
heads
he
moistened
his
lips
so
that
was
how
it
worked
he
had
heard
tau
speak
often
enough
about
under
such
conditions
but
this
was
the
first
time
the
meaning
of
it
had
been
clear
two
men
were
shuffling
out
of
nowhere
wearing
nothing
on
their
dark
bodies
but
kilts
of
tails
black
tails
with
fluffy
white
tips
which
swayed
uniformly
in
time
to
their
pacing
feet
their
heads
and
shoulders
were
masked
by
beautifully
cured
and
animal
heads
displaying
jaws
with
double
pairs
of
curved
fangs
the
striped
fur
the
sharply
pointed
ears
were
neither
canine
nor
feline
but
a
weird
combination
of
the
two
dane
gabbled
two
trading
formulas
under
his
breath
and
tried
to
think
of
the
relation
of
samantine
rock
coinage
to
galactic
credits
only
this
time
his
defenses
did
not
work
from
between
the
two
shuffling
dancers
padded
something
on
four
feet
the
creature
was
more
than
just
a
head
it
was
a
graceful
body
fully
eight
feet
in
length
and
the
red
eyes
in
the
head
were
those
of
a
confident
killer
it
walked
without
restraint
lazily
with
arrogance
its
tail
swinging
and
when
it
reached
the
of
the
terrace
it
flung
up
its
head
as
if
to
challenge
but
words
issued
from
between
those
curved
fangs
words
which
dane
might
not
understand
but
which
undoubtedly
held
meaning
for
the
men
nodding
in
time
to
the
hypnotic
cadence
of
that
da
da
da
beautiful
tau
spoke
in
honest
admiration
his
own
eyes
almost
as
feral
as
those
of
the
talking
beast
as
he
leaned
forward
his
fists
on
his
knees
now
the
animal
was
dancing
also
its
paws
following
the
pace
set
by
the
masked
attendants
it
must
be
a
man
in
an
animal
skin
but
dane
could
hardly
believe
that
the
illusion
was
too
perfect
his
own
hands
went
to
the
knife
sheath
at
his
belt
out
of
deference
to
local
custom
they
had
left
their
stun
rods
in
the
palace
but
a
belt
knife
was
an
accepted
article
of
apparel
dane
slid
the
blade
out
surreptitiously
setting
its
point
against
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
jabbing
painfully
this
was
another
of
tau
answers
for
breaking
a
spell
but
the
white
and
black
creature
continued
to
dance
there
was
no
blurring
of
its
body
lines
into
those
of
a
human
being
it
sang
on
in
a
voice
and
dane
noted
that
those
of
the
audience
nearest
the
stools
where
asaki
and
the
captain
were
seated
now
watched
the
chief
ranger
and
the
space
officer
he
felt
tau
tense
beside
him
trouble
coming
the
warning
from
tau
was
the
merest
thread
of
sound
dane
forced
himself
to
look
away
from
the
swaying
to
watch
instead
the
singers
who
were
now
furtively
eying
their
lord
and
his
guest
the
terran
knew
that
there
were
feudal
bonds
between
the
ranger
and
his
men
but
suppose
this
was
a
showdown
between
lumbrilo
and
asaki
whose
side
would
these
men
take
he
watched
captain
jellico
hand
slide
across
his
knee
his
fingers
drop
in
touching
distance
of
knife
hilt
and
the
hand
of
the
chief
ranger
hanging
lax
at
his
side
suddenly
balled
into
a
fist
so
tau
expelled
the
word
as
a
hiss
he
moved
with
speed
now
he
passed
between
the
stools
to
confront
the
dancing
yet
he
did
not
look
at
that
weird
creature
and
its
attendants
instead
his
arms
were
flung
high
as
if
to
ward
off
or
perhaps
welcome
something
on
the
mountain
side
as
he
shouted
eldama
hodi
as
one
those
on
the
terrace
turned
looked
up
toward
the
slope
dane
was
on
his
feet
holding
his
knife
as
he
might
a
sword
though
of
what
use
its
puny
length
would
be
against
that
huge
bulk
moving
in
slow
majesty
toward
them
he
did
not
try
to
think
trunk
curled
upward
between
great
ivory
tusks
ears
went
wide
as
ponderous
feet
crunched
volcanic
soil
tau
moved
forward
his
hands
still
upraised
clearly
in
greeting
that
trunk
touched
skyward
as
if
in
salute
to
the
man
who
could
be
crushed
under
one
foot
eldama
for
the
second
time
tau
hailed
the
monster
elephant
and
the
trunk
raised
in
silent
greeting
from
one
lord
of
an
earth
to
another
he
recognized
as
an
equal
perhaps
it
had
been
a
thousand
years
since
man
and
elephant
had
stood
so
and
then
there
had
been
only
war
and
death
between
them
now
there
was
peace
and
a
current
of
power
flowing
from
one
to
the
other
dane
sensed
this
saw
the
men
on
the
terrace
likewise
drawing
back
from
the
unseen
tie
between
the
medic
and
the
bull
he
had
so
clearly
summoned
then
tau
upheld
hands
came
together
in
a
sharp
clap
and
men
held
their
breath
in
wonder
where
the
great
bull
had
stood
there
was
nothing
except
rocks
in
the
sun
as
tau
swung
around
to
face
the
that
creature
had
no
substance
either
for
he
fronted
no
animal
but
a
man
a
small
lean
man
whose
lips
wrinkled
back
from
his
teeth
in
a
snarl
his
attendant
priests
fell
back
leaving
the
spaceman
and
the
witch
doctor
alone
lumbrilo
magic
is
great
tau
said
evenly
i
hail
lumbrilo
of
khatka
his
hand
made
the
salute
of
peace
the
snarl
faded
as
the
man
brought
his
face
under
control
he
stood
naked
but
he
was
clothed
in
inherit
dignity
and
there
was
power
with
that
dignity
power
and
a
pride
before
which
even
the
more
physically
impressive
chief
ranger
might
have
to
give
place
you
have
magic
also
outlander
he
replied
where
walks
this
shadow
of
yours
now
where
once
the
men
of
khatka
walked
lumbrilo
for
it
was
men
of
your
blood
who
long
long
past
hunted
this
shadow
of
mine
and
made
its
body
their
prey
so
that
it
now
might
have
a
blood
debt
to
settle
with
us
outlander
that
you
said
not
i
man
of
power
you
have
shown
us
one
beast
i
have
shown
another
who
can
say
which
of
them
is
stronger
when
it
issues
forth
from
the
shadows
lumbrilo
pattered
forward
his
bare
feet
making
little
sound
on
the
stones
of
the
terrace
now
he
was
only
an
away
from
the
medic
you
have
challenged
me
man
was
that
a
question
or
a
statement
dane
wondered
why
should
i
challenge
you
lumbrilo
to
each
race
its
own
magic
i
come
not
to
offer
battle
his
eyes
held
steady
with
the
khatkan
you
have
challenged
me
lumbrilo
turned
away
and
then
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
the
strength
you
depend
upon
may
become
a
broken
staff
remember
my
words
in
the
time
when
shadows
become
substance
and
substance
the
thinnest
of
shadows
iii
you
are
truly
a
man
of
power
tau
shook
his
head
in
answer
to
that
outburst
from
asaki
not
so
sir
your
lumbrilo
is
a
man
of
power
i
drew
upon
his
power
and
you
saw
the
results
deny
it
not
what
we
saw
never
walked
this
world
tau
slung
the
strap
of
a
trail
bag
over
his
shoulder
sir
once
men
of
your
blood
men
who
bred
your
race
hunted
the
elephant
they
took
his
tusks
for
their
treasure
feasted
upon
his
flesh
yes
and
died
beneath
the
trampling
of
his
feet
when
they
were
unlucky
or
unwary
so
there
is
that
within
you
which
can
even
now
be
awakened
to
remember
in
his
might
when
he
was
king
of
the
herd
and
need
fear
nothing
save
the
spears
and
cunning
of
small
weak
men
lumbrilo
had
already
awakened
your
minds
to
see
what
he
willed
you
to
see
how
does
he
do
this
asked
the
other
simply
is
it
magic
that
we
see
not
lumbrilo
but
a
lion
before
us
he
weaves
his
spell
with
the
drums
with
the
chant
by
the
suggestion
his
mind
imposes
upon
yours
and
having
woven
his
spell
he
can
not
limit
it
to
just
the
picture
he
suggests
if
ancient
racial
memories
raise
another
i
merely
used
the
tools
of
lumbrilo
to
show
you
yet
another
picture
your
people
once
knew
well
and
in
so
doing
made
an
enemy
asaki
stood
before
a
rack
of
very
modern
weapons
now
he
made
his
selection
a
silver
tube
with
a
stock
curved
to
fit
a
man
shoulder
lumbrilo
will
not
forget
tau
laughed
shortly
no
but
then
i
have
merely
done
as
you
wished
have
i
not
sir
i
have
focused
on
myself
the
enmity
of
a
dangerous
man
and
now
you
hope
i
shall
be
forced
in
to
remove
him
from
your
path
the
khatkan
turned
slowly
resting
the
weapon
across
his
forearm
i
do
not
deny
that
spaceman
then
matters
here
are
indeed
serious
they
are
so
serious
asaki
interrupted
speaking
not
only
to
tau
but
to
the
other
as
well
that
what
happens
now
may
mean
the
end
of
the
khatka
that
i
know
lumbrilo
is
the
most
dangerous
game
i
have
faced
in
a
lifetime
as
a
hunter
he
goes
or
we
draw
his
fangs
or
else
all
that
i
am
all
i
have
labored
here
to
build
will
be
swept
away
to
preserve
this
i
will
use
any
weapon
and
i
am
now
your
weapon
which
you
hope
will
be
as
successful
as
that
needler
you
are
carrying
tau
laughed
again
without
much
humor
let
us
hope
i
shall
prove
as
effective
jellico
moved
out
of
the
shadows
it
was
just
after
dawn
and
the
grayness
of
the
vanishing
night
still
held
in
the
corners
of
the
armory
deliberately
he
took
his
own
stand
before
the
arms
racks
and
chose
a
blaster
only
when
its
butt
was
cupped
in
his
hand
did
he
glance
at
his
host
we
came
guesting
asaki
we
have
eaten
salt
and
bread
under
this
roof
on
my
body
and
my
blood
it
is
returned
the
khatkan
grimly
i
shall
go
down
to
the
blackness
of
sabra
before
you
do
if
the
flames
of
death
are
against
us
from
his
belt
he
flipped
loose
his
knife
and
offered
the
hilt
to
jellico
my
body
for
a
wall
between
you
and
the
dark
captain
but
also
understand
this
to
me
what
i
do
now
is
greater
than
the
life
of
any
one
man
lumbrilo
and
the
evil
behind
him
must
be
rooted
out
there
was
no
trickery
in
my
invitation
they
stood
eye
to
eye
equal
in
height
in
authority
of
person
and
that
indefinable
something
which
made
them
both
masters
in
their
own
different
worlds
then
jellico
hand
went
out
his
fingertip
flicked
the
hilt
of
the
bared
blade
there
was
no
trickery
he
conceded
i
knew
that
your
need
was
great
when
you
came
to
the
since
both
the
captain
and
tau
appeared
to
accept
the
situation
dane
not
quite
understanding
it
all
was
prepared
to
follow
their
lead
and
for
the
moment
they
had
nothing
more
in
plan
than
to
visit
the
zoboru
preserve
they
went
by
flitter
asaki
one
of
his
hunter
pilots
and
the
three
from
the
lifting
over
the
rim
of
mountains
behind
the
and
speeding
north
with
the
rising
sun
a
flaming
ball
to
the
east
below
the
country
was
stark
rocks
and
peaks
deep
purple
shadows
marking
the
veins
of
crevices
but
that
was
swiftly
behind
and
they
were
over
a
sea
of
greens
many
shades
of
green
with
yellow
blue
even
red
cutting
into
the
general
verdant
carpet
of
treetops
another
chain
of
heights
and
then
open
land
swales
of
tall
grass
already
burnt
yellow
by
the
steady
sun
there
was
a
river
here
a
crazy
twisted
stream
coiling
nearly
back
upon
itself
at
times
once
more
broken
land
land
so
ravished
by
prehistoric
volcanic
action
that
it
was
a
grotesque
nightmare
of
outcrops
and
mesas
asaki
pointed
to
the
east
there
was
a
dark
patch
widening
out
into
a
vast
wedge
the
swamp
of
mygra
it
has
not
yet
been
explored
you
could
air
map
it
tau
began
the
chief
ranger
was
frowning
four
flitters
have
been
lost
trying
that
com
reports
fail
when
they
cross
that
last
mountain
ridge
eastward
there
is
some
sort
of
interference
which
we
do
not
yet
understand
mygra
is
a
place
of
death
later
we
may
be
able
to
travel
along
its
fringe
and
then
you
shall
see
now
he
spoke
to
the
pilot
in
his
own
tongue
and
the
flitter
pointed
at
an
angle
as
they
climbed
over
the
highest
peak
they
had
yet
seen
in
this
mountainous
land
to
reach
at
last
a
country
of
open
grass
dotted
with
small
forest
stands
jellico
nodded
approvingly
zoboru
zoboru
asaki
assented
we
shall
go
up
to
the
northern
end
of
the
preserve
i
wish
to
show
you
the
roosts
of
the
fastals
this
is
their
nesting
season
and
the
sight
is
one
you
will
long
remember
but
we
shall
take
an
eastern
course
i
have
two
ranger
stations
to
check
on
the
way
it
was
after
they
left
the
second
station
that
the
flitter
swung
farther
out
eastward
again
climbing
over
the
chain
of
heights
to
sight
one
of
the
newly
discovered
wonders
the
staff
at
the
last
station
had
reported
a
crater
lake
and
the
flitter
skimmed
down
across
water
which
was
a
rich
emerald
in
hue
filling
the
crater
from
one
rock
wall
to
the
other
with
no
beach
at
the
foot
of
those
precipitant
cliffs
as
the
machine
arose
to
clear
the
far
wall
dane
tensed
one
of
his
duties
aboard
the
was
flitter
pilot
for
planetwise
trips
and
ever
since
they
had
taken
off
that
morning
he
had
unconsciously
flown
with
the
khatkan
pilot
anticipating
each
change
or
adjustment
of
the
controls
now
he
felt
that
sluggish
response
to
the
other
lift
signal
and
instinctively
his
own
hand
went
out
to
adjust
a
power
feed
lever
they
made
the
rise
were
well
above
the
danger
of
the
cliff
wall
but
the
machine
was
not
responding
properly
dane
did
not
need
to
watch
the
pilot
swiftly
moving
hands
to
guess
that
they
were
in
trouble
and
his
slight
concern
deepened
into
something
else
as
the
flitter
began
to
drop
nose
again
in
front
of
him
captain
jellico
shifted
uneasily
and
dane
knew
that
he
too
was
alerted
now
the
pilot
had
plunged
the
power
adjuster
to
the
head
against
the
control
board
but
the
nose
of
the
flitter
acted
as
if
it
were
overweighted
or
magnetically
attracted
by
the
rocks
below
the
best
efforts
of
the
man
flying
it
could
not
keep
it
level
they
were
being
drawn
earthward
and
all
the
pilot
could
do
only
delayed
the
inevitable
the
khatkan
was
turning
the
machine
north
to
avoid
what
lay
below
for
here
a
long
arm
of
the
mygra
swamp
clasped
about
the
foot
of
the
mountain
the
chief
ranger
spoke
into
the
mike
of
the
com
unit
while
the
pilot
continued
to
fight
against
the
pull
which
was
bringing
them
down
now
the
small
machine
was
below
the
level
of
the
volcanic
peak
which
cradled
the
lake
and
the
mountain
lay
between
them
and
the
preserve
asaki
gave
a
muffled
exclamation
slapped
the
com
box
spoke
more
sharply
into
the
mike
it
was
apparent
he
was
not
getting
the
results
he
wanted
then
with
a
quick
glance
about
he
snapped
an
order
strap
in
his
terran
companions
had
already
buckled
the
wide
webbing
belts
intended
to
save
them
from
crash
shock
dane
saw
the
pilot
push
the
button
to
release
fend
cushions
in
spite
of
his
pounding
heart
a
small
fraction
of
his
brain
recognized
the
other
skill
as
the
khatkan
took
a
course
to
bring
them
down
on
a
relatively
level
patch
of
sand
and
gravel
dane
raised
his
head
from
the
shelter
of
his
folded
arms
the
chief
ranger
was
busy
with
the
pilot
who
lay
limply
against
the
controls
captain
jellico
and
tau
were
already
pulling
at
the
buckles
of
their
protective
crash
belts
but
one
look
at
the
front
of
the
flitter
told
dane
that
it
would
not
take
to
the
air
again
without
extensive
repairs
its
nose
was
bent
up
and
back
obscuring
the
forward
view
completely
however
the
pilot
had
made
a
miraculously
safe
landing
considering
the
terrain
ten
minutes
later
the
pilot
restored
to
consciousness
and
the
gash
in
his
head
bandaged
they
held
a
council
of
war
the
com
was
off
too
i
did
not
have
a
chance
to
report
before
the
crash
asaki
put
the
situation
straightly
and
our
exploring
parties
have
not
yet
mapped
this
side
of
the
range
it
has
a
bad
reputation
because
of
the
swamp
jellico
measured
the
heights
now
to
their
west
with
resigned
eyes
looks
as
if
we
climb
not
here
the
chief
ranger
corrected
him
there
is
no
passing
through
the
crater
lake
region
on
foot
we
must
travel
south
along
the
edge
of
the
mountain
area
until
we
do
find
a
scalable
way
into
the
preserve
region
you
seem
very
certain
we
are
not
going
to
be
rescued
if
we
stay
right
here
tau
observed
why
because
i
inclined
to
believe
that
any
flitter
that
tries
to
reach
us
may
run
into
the
same
trouble
also
they
have
no
com
fix
on
us
it
will
be
at
least
a
day
or
more
before
they
will
even
begin
to
count
us
missing
and
then
they
will
have
the
whole
northern
portion
of
the
preserve
to
comb
there
are
not
enough
men
here
i
can
give
you
a
multitude
of
reasons
medic
one
of
which
might
be
sabotage
demanded
jellico
asaki
shrugged
perhaps
i
am
not
loved
in
some
quarters
but
there
may
also
be
something
fatal
to
flitters
here
as
there
is
over
mygra
we
thought
the
crater
lake
district
safely
beyond
the
swamp
influence
but
it
may
not
be
so
but
you
took
the
chance
of
traveling
over
it
dane
thought
though
he
did
not
comment
aloud
was
this
another
of
the
chief
ranger
attempts
to
involve
them
in
some
private
trouble
of
his
own
though
to
deliberately
smash
up
a
flitter
and
set
them
all
afoot
in
this
wilderness
was
a
pretty
drastic
move
asaki
had
started
to
unload
emergency
supplies
from
the
flitter
they
each
had
a
trail
bag
for
a
pack
but
when
the
pilot
staggered
over
to
pull
out
a
set
of
stass
belts
and
jellico
began
to
uncoil
them
the
chief
ranger
shook
his
head
with
the

tossed
one
on
the
crumpled
nose
of
the
flitter
and
punched
its
button
with
the
tip
of
the
needler
barrel
then
he
threw
a
rock
at
the
dangling
belt
the
stone
landed
taking
the
wide
protective
band
with
it
to
the

that

the

oh
fine
tau
opened
his

to

then
he
smiled
crookedly
we
are
signed
in
for
killing
licenses
sir
do
you
pay
our
fines
if
we
are
forced
to
shoot
a
hole
through
something
that
disputes
the
right
of

to
dane
surprise
the
chief
ranger
laughed
you
are
off
preserve
now
medic
tau
the
rules
do
not
cover
wild
land
but
i
would
suggest
we
now
hunt
a
cave
before
nightfall
lions
asked
jellico
dane
remembering
the
black
and
white
beast
lumbrilo
had
presented
did
not
enjoy
that
thought
they
had
his
gaze
went
from
man
to
man
checking
weapons
the
needler
asaki
carried
and
another
the
pilot
had
slung
by
its
carrying
strap
over
his
shoulder
tau
and
the
captain
both
were
armed
with
blasters
and
he
had
a
fire
ray
and
a
force
blade
both
considered
small
arms
but
deadly
enough
perhaps
even
to
dampen
a
enthusiasm
for
the
chase
lions
graz
rock
apes
asaki
fastened
the
mouth
of
his
trail
bag
all
are
hunters
or
killers
the
graz
send
out
scouts
and
they
are
big
and
formidable
enough
to
have
no
enemies
lions
hunt
with
intelligence
and
skill
rock
apes
are
dangerous
but
luckily
they
can
not
keep
silent
when
they
scent
their
prey
and
so
give
one
warning
as
they
climbed
from
the
flitter
dane
looking
back
saw
that
perhaps
asaki
was
right
in
his
belief
that
they
had
better
try
to
help
themselves
rather
than
wait
for
rescue
putting
aside
the
excuse
of
fearing
another
the
wrecked
flitter
made
no
outstanding
mark
on
the
ground
the
higher
they
climbed
the
less
it
could
be
distinguished
from
the
tumble
of
rocks
about
it
he
had
lagged
a
little
behind
and
when
he
hurried
to
catch
up
found
jellico
standing
with
his
distance
vision
lenses
to
his
eyes
directing
them
toward
that
shadow
marking
the
swamp
as
the
younger
spaceman
reached
him
the
captain
lowered
the
glasses
and
spoke
take
your
knife
thorson
and
hold
it
close
to
that
rock
over
there
he
pointed
to
a
rounded
black
knob
protruding
from
the
soil
a
little
off
their
path
dane
obeyed
only
to
have
the
blade
jerk
in
his
hand
and
when
he
loosened
his
hold
in
amazement
the
steel
slapped
tight
against
the
stone
magnetic
yes
which
might
explain
our
crash
also
this
jellico
held
out
a
field
compass
to
demonstrate
that
its
needle
had
gone
completely
mad
we
can
use
the
mountain
range
itself
for
a
guide
dane
said
with
more
confidence
than
he
felt
true
enough
but
we
may
have
trouble
when
we
head
west
again
jellico
let
the
lenses
swing
free
on
their
cord
about
his
neck
if
we
were
wrecked
on
purpose
his
mouth
tightened
and
the
old
blaster
burn
on
his
cheek
stretched
as
did
his
jaw
set
then
someone
is
going
to
answer
a
lot
of
questions
and
fast
the
chief
ranger
sir
i
do
know
i
just
do
know
the
captain
grunted
as
he
adjusted
his
pack
and
started
on
if
fortune
had
failed
them
earlier
she
smiled
on
them
now
asaki
discovered
a
cave
before
sundown
located
not
too
far
from
a
mountain
stream
the
ranger
sniffed
the
air
before
that
dark
opening
as
the
hunter
pilot
shed
his
equipment
and
crept
forward
on
his
hands
and
knees
his
head
up
and
his
nostrils
expanding
as
he
too
tested
the
scent
from
the
cave
mouth
scent
it
was
closer
to
a
stench
and
one
ripe
enough
to
turn
the
stomach
of
an
but
the
hunter
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
and
nodded
reassuringly
lion
but
old
not
here
within
five
days
at
least
well
enough
and
even
old
lion
scent
will
keep
away
rock
apes
clean
some
and
then
we
can
rest
undisturbed
was
his
comment
the
cleaning
was
easy
for
the
brittle
bedding
of
dried
bracken
and
grass
the
beast
had
left
burned
quickly
cleansing
with
both
fire
and
smoke
when
they
raked
the
ashes
out
with
branches
asaki
and
nymani
brought
in
handfuls
of
leaves
which
they
crumpled
and
threw
on
the
floor
spreading
an
aromatic
odor
which
banished
most
of
the
foulness
dane
at
the
stream
with
the
canteens
to
fill
chanced
upon
a
small
pool
where
there
was
a
spread
of
smooth
yellow
sand
knowing
well
the
many
weird
booby
traps
one
might
stumble
into
on
a
strange
world
the
terran
prospected
carefully
stirring
up
the
stand
with
a
stick
sighting
not
so
much
as
a
water
insect
or
a
curious
fish
he
pulled
off
his
boots
rolled
up
his
breeches
and
waded
in
the
water
was
cool
and
refreshing
though
he
dared
not
drink
it
until
the
purifier
was
added
then
with
the
filled
canteens
knotted
together
by
their
straps
he
put
on
his
boots
and
climbed
to
the
cave
where
tau
waited
with
water
tablets
half
an
hour
later
dane
sat
by
the
fire
turning
a
spit
strung
with
three
small
birds
asaki
had
brought
in
one
foot
closer
to
the
heat
began
to
tingle
and
he
eased
off
his
boot
his
cramped
toes
suddenly
seeming
to
have
doubled
in
size
he
was
staring
at
these
same
toes
puffed
red
and
increasingly
painful
to
the
touch
when
nymani
squatted
beside
him
inspected
his
foot
closely
and
ordered
him
to
take
off
his
other
boot
what
is
it
dane
found
that
shedding
the
other
boot
was
a
minor
torture
in
itself
nymani
was
cutting
tiny
splinters
hardly
thicker
than
a
needle
from
a
stick
sand
worm
lays
eggs
in
flesh
we
burn
them
out
or
you
have
bad
foot
burn
them
out
dane
echoed
and
then
swallowed
as
he
watched
nymani
advance
a
splinter
to
the
fire
burn
them
the
khatkan
repeated
firmly
burn
tonight
hurt
some
tomorrow
all
well
soon
no
burn
very
bad
dane
ruefully
prepared
to
pay
the
consequences
of
his
first
brush
with
the
unpleasant
surprises
khatka
had
to
offer
iv
dane
regarded
his
throbbing
feet
morosely
nymani
operations
with
burning
splinters
had
been
hard
to
take
but
he
had
endured
them
without
disgracing
himself
before
the
khatkans
who
appeared
to
regard
such
a
mishap
as
just
another
travel
incident
now
with
tau
salve
soothing
the
worst
of
the
after
affects
the
terran
was
given
time
to
reflect
upon
his
own
stupidity
and
the
fact
that
he
might
now
prove
a
drag
on
the
whole
party
the
next
morning
that
queer
dane
was
startled
out
of
the
contemplation
of
his
misery
to
see
the
medic
on
his
knees
before
their
row
of
canteens
the
vial
of
water
purifier
held
to
the
firelight
for
a
closer
inspection
what
the
matter
we
must
have
hit
with
a
pretty
hard
thump
back
there
some
of
these
pills
are
powder
have
to
guess
about
the
portion
to
add
with
the
tip
of
his
knife
blade
tau
scraped
a
tiny
amount
of
pill
fragments
into
each
waiting
canteen
that
should
do
it
but
if
the
water
tastes
a
little
bitter
do
let
it
bother
you
bitter
water
dane
thought
trying
to
flex
his
still
swollen
toes
was
going
to
be
the
least
of
his
worries
in
the
morning
but
he
determined
that
his
boots
should
go
on
at
daybreak
and
he
would
keep
on
his
feet
as
long
as
the
others
did
no
matter
how
much
it
cost
him
and
when
they
set
out
shortly
after
daybreak
wanting
to
move
as
far
as
they
could
before
the
heat
hours
when
they
must
rest
the
going
was
not
too
bad
dane
feet
were
tender
to
the
touch
but
he
could
shuffle
along
at
the
tail
of
the
procession
with
only
nymani
playing
rear
guard
behind
him
jungle
lay
before
them
and
bush
knives
began
to
swing
clearing
their
path
dane
took
his
turn
with
the
rest
at
that
chore
thankful
that
the
business
of
cutting
their
way
through
that
mass
of
greenery
slowed
them
to
a
pace
he
could
match
if
not
in
comfort
then
by
willpower
but
the
sand
worms
were
not
the
only
troubles
one
could
encounter
on
khatka
within
an
hour
captain
jellico
stood
sweating
and
speaking
his
mind
freely
in
the
native
tongues
of
five
different
planets
while
tau
and
nymani
worked
as
a
team
with
skinning
knives
they
were
not
flaying
the
spaceman
but
they
came
near
to
that
in
places
as
they
worried
a
choice
selection
of
tree
thorns
out
of
his
arm
and
shoulder
the
captain
had
been
unfortunate
enough
to
trip
and
fall
into
the
embrace
of
a
very
unfriendly
bush
dane
inspected
a
fallen
tree
for
evidence
of
inimical
wild
life
and
then
rested
his
blanket
between
him
and
it
as
a
protecting
cushion
before
he
sat
down
these
trees
were
not
the
towering
giants
of
the
true
forests
but
rather
oversized
bushes
which
had
been
made
into
walls
by
twined
vines
brilliant
bursts
of
flowers
were
splotches
of
vivid
color
and
the
attendant
insect
life
was
altogether
too
abundant
dane
tried
to
tally
his
immunity
shots
and
hoped
for
the
best
at
the
moment
he
wondered
why
anyone
would
want
to
visit
khatka
let
alone
pay
some
astronomical
sum
for
the
privilege
though
he
could
also
guess
that
the
plush
safari
arranged
for
a
paying
client
might
be
run
on
quite
different
lines
from
their
own
present
trek
how
a
tracker
find
his
way
through
this
with
the
compasses
playing
crazy
tricks
into
the
bargain
jellico
knew
that
the
compasses
were
off
yet
the
captain
had
followed
asaki
lead
without
question
so
he
must
trust
the
ranger
forest
craft
but
dane
wished
they
were
clear
on
the
mountain
side
again
time
had
little
meaning
in
that
green
gloom
but
when
they
worked
through
to
meet
rock
walls
again
the
sun
said
it
was
well
into
the
after
part
of
the
day
they
sheltered
for
a
breather
under
the
drooping
limbs
of
one
of
the
last
trees
amazing
jellico
his
torn
arm
in
a
sling
across
his
chest
came
from
the
higher
point
where
he
had
been
using
the
distance
lenses
we
struck
straight
across
and
cut
off
about
ten
miles
by
that
jungle
jog
now
i
believe
all
that
i
heard
of
your
people
ability
to
cross
wilderness
and
not
lose
their
built
in
beams
sir
with
the
compasses
out
i
admit
i
been
nourishing
a
healthy
set
of
doubts
asaki
laughed
captain
i
do
not
question
your
ability
to
flit
from
world
to
world
or
how
you
have
learned
to
set
up
trade
with
strange
humans
and
alike
to
each
his
own
mystery
on
khatka
every
boy
before
he
becomes
a
man
must
learn
to
navigate
the
jungle
and
with
no
instruments
to
help
him
only
what
lies
in
here
he
touched
his
thumb
to
his
forehead
so
through
generations
we
have
developed
our
homing
instincts
those
who
did
not
also
did
not
live
to
father
others
who
might
have
had
the
same
lack
we
are
hounds
who
can
run
on
a
scent
and
we
are
migrators
who
have
better
than
a
compass
within
our
own
bodies
now
we
take
to
climbing
again
tau
surveyed
the
way
before
them
critically
not
at
this
hour
that
sun
on
the
upward
slopes
can
cook
a
man
skin
were
he
to
touch
any
rock
we
wait
waiting
for
the
khatkans
was
a
chance
to
sleep
they
curled
up
on
their
light
blankets
but
the
three
spacemen
were
restless
dane
would
have
liked
to
have
taken
off
his
boots
but
feared
he
could
not
replace
them
and
he
could
tell
from
the
way
the
captain
shifted
his
position
that
jellico
was
in
pain
too
tau
sat
quietly
staring
at
nothing
dane
could
see
unless
it
was
a
tall
rock
thrust
out
of
the
slope
like
a
finger
pointing
skyward
what
color
is
that
rock
surprised
dane
gave
the
stony
finger
closer
attention
to
him
it
was
the
same
color
as
most
of
the
other
rocks
a
weathered
black
which
in
certain
lights
appeared
to
carry
a
brownish
film
black
or
maybe
dark
brown
tau
looked
past
him
to
jellico
the
captain
nodded
i
agree
with
that
tau
cupped
his
hands
over
his
eyes
for
a
moment
and
his
lips
moved
as
if
he
were
counting
then
he
took
his
hands
away
and
stared
dane
watched
the
medic
eyelids
blink
slowly
nothing
but
black
or
brown
tau
pressed
no
jellico
supported
his
injured
arm
upon
his
knees
leaning
forward
as
intent
upon
the
designated
rock
as
if
he
expected
it
to
assume
some
far
more
startling
appearance
queer
tau
said
to
himself
and
then
added
briskly
you
right
of
course
that
sun
can
play
tricks
with
one
eyes
dane
continued
to
watch
the
finger
rock
maybe
strong
sunlight
could
play
tricks
but
he
could
see
nothing
odd
about
that
rough
lump
and
since
the
captain
asked
no
questions
of
tau
he
did
not
quite
want
to
either
it
was
perhaps
a
later
and
the
medic
and
jellico
had
both
succumbed
to
the
quiet
the
heat
and
their
own
fatigue
when
dane
did
sight
a
movement
the
throbbing
in
his
feet
was
worse
now
that
he
had
nothing
to
occupy
his
mind
but
his
own
troubles
and
he
was
sitting
facing
the
finger
rock
was
that
what
tau
had
seen
earlier
that
quick
movement
around
the
side
of
the
rough
pillar
but
if
so
why
the
question
of
color
there
it
was
again
and
now
centering
all
his
attention
on
that
one
point
the
terran
picked
out
the
outline
of
a
head
a
head
grotesque
enough
to
be
something
conjured
out
of
lumbrilo
sorcerer
imagination
had
dane
not
seen
its
like
among
the
prints
in
captain
collection
he
would
have
believed
that
his
eyes
were
playing
tricks
it
was
a
head
embellished
by
two
prick
ears
the
pointed
tips
of
which
projected
well
above
the
top
of
the
skull
round
eyes
were
set
deeply
in
sunken
pits
the
mouth
was
a
swinish
snout
from
which
lolled
a
purple
tongue
though
the
rest
of
that
gargoyle
head
was
very
close
in
color
to
the
rock
against
which
it
half
rested
dane
had
no
doubts
that
the
rock
ape
was
spying
upon
the
small
camp
having
heard
tales
of
those
animals
the
most
intelligent
native
creatures
of
khatka
most
of
which
were
concerned
with
their
more
malignant
characteristics
dane
was
alarmed
that
lurker
could
be
an
advance
scout
of
some
pack
and
a
pack
of
rock
apes
if
able
to
surprise
their
prey
were
formidable
opponents
asaki
stirred
sat
up
and
that
round
head
above
turned
to
follow
the
chief
ranger
every
move
above
by
the
finger
rock
to
the
right
dane
kept
his
voice
close
to
a
whisper
when
he
saw
the
sudden
constriction
of
muscle
across
the
khatkan
bare
shoulders
he
knew
that
the
other
had
heard
and
understood
only
if
asaki
had
spotted
the
rock
ape
he
did
not
betray
his
knowledge
the
khatkan
got
lithely
to
his
feet
then
one
of
those
feet
stirred
nymani
into
the
instant
wakefulness
of
the
man
dane
slid
his
hand
about
the
bole
of
the
tree
and
touched
jellico
watched
the
captain
gray
eyes
open
with
a
similar
awareness
asaki
picked
up
his
needler
weapon
in
hand
he
whirled
and
fired
almost
in
one
connected
movement
it
was
the
fastest
shot
dane
had
ever
seen
the
gargoyle
head
lifted
away
from
the
rock
and
then
turned
to
one
side
as
its
body
somehow
vaguely
obscene
in
its
resemblance
to
the
human
form
fell
away
to
sprawl
limply
though
the
dead
rock
ape
had
not
had
a
chance
to
give
tongue
there
came
a
cry
from
above
a
coughing
hawking
down
the
steep
incline
bumped
a
round
white
ball
bouncing
past
the
tumbled
carcass
of
the
ape
sailing
up
into
the
air
to
strike
and
burst
open
a
few
feet
away
back
with
one
arm
asaki
sent
jellico
his
nearest
neighbor
tumbling
back
into
the
jungle
then
the
chief
ranger
pumped
a
stream
of
needle
rays
into
the
remains
of
the
ball
a
shrill
sweet
humming
arose
as
red
motes
vivid
as
molten
copper
in
the
sunlight
climbed
on
wings
beating
too
fast
to
be
seen
the
debris
of
the
nest
smoked
into
nothing
but
no
needle
ray
could
hope
to
stop
all
the
poisonous
army
issuing
forth
from
it
fighting
mad
to
seek
any
creature
within
scenting
distance
the
men
threw
themselves
into
the
brush
rolling
in
the
thick
mold
of
the
vegetable
decay
on
the
ground
rubbing
its
moist
plaster
over
their
bodies
in
frantic
haste
fire
far
worse
than
any
of
the
splinter
torment
dane
had
undergone
the
night
before
pierced
between
his
shoulders
he
rolled
on
his
back
shoving
himself
along
both
to
kill
the
and
coat
the
sting
with
cooling
mold
cries
of
pain
told
him
that
he
was
not
the
only
sufferer
as
all
dug
hands
into
the
slimy
stuff
under
them
and
slapped
it
over
their
faces
and
heads
apes
that
half
shout
got
through
to
alert
the
men
on
the
jungle
floor
true
to
their
nature
the
rock
apes
now
streaming
downhill
were
coughing
their
challenges
advertising
their
attack
and
it
was
only
that
peculiarity
of
their
species
which
saved
their
intended
victims
the
apes
came
forward
partially
erect
at
a
shambling
run
the
first
two
bulls
close
to
six
feet
went
down
under
fire
from
asaki
needler
a
third
somehow
escaped
swerving
to
the
left
and
came
bounding
at
an
angle
toward
dane
the
terran
jerked
free
his
force
blade
as
that
swine
snout
split
wide
to
show
greenish
tusks
and
the
horrible
stench
of
the
creature
body
made
him
gasp
a
taloned
paw
clawed
at
him
eagerly
slipped
from
his
body
just
as
he
brought
the
force
blade
up
foul
breath
coughed
in
his
face
and
he
stumbled
back
as
the
heavy
body
of
the
ape
crashed
against
him
cut
in
half
by
the
weapon
to
dane
sickened
horror
the
paws
still
clawed
for
him
the
fangs
still
gnashed
as
he
rolled
free
of
the
mangled
body
and
somehow
got
to
his
feet
the
roar
of
a
blaster
of
two
blasters
drowned
out
the
clamor
of
the
apes
as
dane
drew
his
fire
ray
set
his
shoulders
against
a
tree
bole
and
prepared
to
fight
it
out
he
fired
saw
a
smaller
and
more
nimble
enemy
go
down
screeching
then
there
were
none
left
on
their
shaggy
feet
though
some
on
the
ground
dragged
themselves
forward
still
striving
to
reach
the
men
dane
slapped
a
from
his
leg
he
was
glad
of
the
support
of
the
tree
at
his
back
as
the
smell
of
the
ape
blood
drenching
him
from
chest
level
down
and
the
mess
on
the
ground
made
his
stomach
churn
when
he
could
control
his
retching
he
straightened
to
his
relief
he
saw
that
all
the
others
were
on
their
feet
apparently
unharmed
but
tau
catching
sight
of
the
younger
spaceman
gasped
and
started
for
him
dane
what
did
they
do
his
junior
laughed
a
little
hysterically
not
mine
he
swabbed
with
a
handful
of
grass
at
his
bloodied
breeches
and
blundered
on
into
the
sunlight
nymani
found
them
a
stream
below
a
miniature
falls
where
the
swift
current
prevented
the
lurking
of
sand
worms
they
stripped
eagerly
cleaning
first
themselves
and
then
their
fouled
clothing
while
tau
tended
the
wealth
of
stings
there
was
little
he
could
do
to
relieve
the
swelling
and
pain
until
asaki
produced
a
plant
which
chopped
in
sections
yielded
a
sticky
purple
liquid
that
dried
on
the
skin
as
a
tar
gum
the
native
remedy
so
glued
and
plastered
they
climbed
away
from
the
water
and
prepared
to
spend
the
night
in
a
hollow
between
two
leaning
rocks
certainly
not
as
snug
as
the
cave
but
a
fortress
of
sorts
and
space
hoppers
pay
a
fortune
for
an
outing
like
this
tau
commented
bitterly
hunching
well
forward
so
that
a
certain
stung
portion
of
his
anatomy
would
not
come
in
contact
with
the
rock
beneath
him
hardly
for
this
jellico
replied
and
dane
saw
nymani
grin
his
other
cheek
puffed
and
painted
sticky
purple
we
do
not
always
encounter
apes
and
in
the
same
day
supplied
the
chief
ranger
also
guests
at
the
preserves
wear
stass
belts
jellico
snorted
i
do
think
you
get
any
repeats
from
your
clients
otherwise
what
do
we
meet
tomorrow
a
herd
of
graz
on
stampede
or
something
even
more
subtle
and
deadly
nymani
got
up
and
walked
a
little
way
from
their
rock
shelter
he
turned
and
dane
saw
his
nostrils
expand
as
they
had
when
he
had
investigated
the
cave
something
is
dead
he
said
slowly
a
very
large
something
or
else
asaki
strode
down
to
join
his
men
he
gave
a
curt
nod
and
nymani
skidded
on
down
the
mountain
side
what
is
it
jellico
asked
it
might
be
many
things
there
is
one
i
hope
it
is
not
was
the
chief
ranger
somewhat
evasive
reply
i
will
hunt
a
labbla
there
was
fresh
spoor
at
the
stream
he
set
off
along
their
back
trail
to
return
a
half
hour
later
the
body
of
his
kill
slung
across
one
shoulder
he
was
skinning
it
when
nymani
trotted
back
well
death
pit
supplied
the
hunter
poachers
jellico
inquired
nymani
nodded
asaki
continued
his
task
but
there
was
a
glint
in
his
dark
eyes
as
he
butchered
with
sure
and
expert
strokes
then
he
glanced
at
the
shadow
extending
beyond
the
rocks
i
too
would
see
he
told
nymani
jellico
arose
and
dane
interested
followed
some
five
minutes
later
none
of
them
needed
the
native
keenness
of
smell
to
detect
the
presence
of
some
foulness
ahead
the
odor
of
corruption
was
almost
tangible
in
the
sultry
air
and
it
grew
worse
until
they
stood
on
the
edge
of
a
pit
dane
retreated
hurriedly
this
was
as
bad
as
the
battlefield
of
the
rock
apes
but
the
captain
and
the
two
khatkans
stood
calmly
assessing
the
slaughter
left
by
the
hide
poachers
glam
graz
hoodra
jellico
commented
tusks
and
hides
the
full
line
of
trade
stuff
asaki
his
expression
bleak
stepped
back
from
the
pit
day
old
calves
old
ones
females
all
together
they
kill
wantonly
and
leave
those
they
do
not
choose
to
pelt
trail
nymani
pointed
eastward
leads
to
mygra
swamp
the
swamps
asaki
was
shaken
they
must
be
mad
or
know
more
about
this
country
than
your
men
do
jellico
corrected
if
poachers
can
enter
mygra
then
we
can
follow
but
not
now
dane
protested
silently
certainly
asaki
did
not
mean
that
were
to
track
outlaws
into
swamps
the
khatkan
had
already
labeled
unexplored
death
traps
v
sitting
up
dane
stared
into
the
dark
a
handful
of
glowing
coals
guarded
by
rocks
was
the
center
of
their
camp
he
hunched
up
to
that
hardly
knowing
why
he
moved
his
hands
were
shaking
his
skin
damp
with
sweat
no
heat
produced
yet
now
that
he
was
conscious
of
the
night
the
terran
could
not
remember
the
nightmare
from
which
he
had
just
awakened
though
he
was
left
with
a
growing
apprehension
which
he
could
not
define
what
prowled
out
there
in
that
dark
walked
the
mountain
side
listened
spied
and
waited
dane
half
started
to
his
feet
as
a
form
did
move
into
the
dim
light
of
the
fire
tau
stood
there
regarding
him
with
sober
intensity
bad
dream
the
younger
man
admitted
to
that
with
a
nod
partly
against
his
will
well
you
are
the
only
one
remember
any
of
it
with
an
effort
dane
looked
away
from
the
encircling
dark
it
was
as
if
the
fear
which
had
shaken
him
awake
now
embodied
lurked
right
there
no
he
rubbed
eyes
neither
did
i
tau
remarked
but
both
of
must
have
been
i
suppose
one
could
expect
to
have
nightmares
after
yesterday
dane
advanced
the
logical
explanation
yet
at
the
same
time
something
deep
inside
him
denied
every
word
of
it
he
had
known
nightmares
before
none
of
them
had
left
this
aftertaste
and
he
wanted
no
return
of
sleep
tonight
reaching
to
the
pile
of
wood
he
fed
the
fire
as
tau
settled
down
beside
him
there
is
something
else
the
medic
began
and
then
fell
silent
dane
did
not
press
him
the
younger
man
was
too
busy
fighting
a
growing
desire
to
whirl
and
aim
the
fire
ray
into
that
darkness
to
catch
in
its
withering
blast
that
lurking
thing
he
could
padded
there
biding
its
time
despite
his
efforts
dane
did
drowse
again
before
morning
waking
unrefreshed
and
to
his
secret
dismay
with
no
lessening
of
his
odd
dislike
for
the
country
about
them
asaki
did
not
suggest
that
they
trail
the
poachers
into
the
morass
of
mygra
instead
the
chief
ranger
was
eager
to
press
on
in
the
opposite
direction
find
a
way
over
the
range
to
the
preserve
where
he
could
assemble
a
punitive
force
to
deal
with
the
outlaws
so
they
began
an
upward
climb
which
took
them
away
from
the
dank
heat
of
the
lowlands
into
the
parched
blaze
of
the
sunbaked
ledges
above
the
sun
was
bright
far
too
bright
and
there
were
few
shadows
left
yet
dane
stopping
to
drink
sparingly
from
his
canteen
could
not
lose
that
sense
of
eyes
upon
him
of
being
tracked
rock
apes
cunning
as
those
beasts
were
it
was
against
their
nature
to
trail
in
utter
silence
to
be
able
to
carry
through
a
project
lion
perhaps
he
noted
that
nymani
and
asaki
took
turns
at
rear
guard
today
and
that
each
was
alert
yet
oddly
enough
none
of
them
mentioned
the
uneasiness
they
must
all
share
they
had
a
dry
climb
finding
no
mountain
stream
to
renew
their
water
supply
all
being
experienced
in
wilderness
travel
they
made
a
mouthful
of
liquid
go
a
long
way
when
the
party
halted
slightly
before
midday
canteens
were
still
half
full
they
jerked
up
hands
on
weapons
a
rock
ape
its
hideous
body
clearly
seen
here
capered
coughed
spat
asaki
fired
from
the
hip
and
the
thing
screeched
clawed
at
its
chest
where
the
dark
blood
spewed
out
and
raced
for
them
nymani
cut
the
beast
down
and
they
waited
tensely
for
the
attack
of
the
thing
tribe
which
should
have
followed
the
abortive
lunge
on
the
part
of
their
scout
but
there
was
nothing
neither
sound
nor
movement
what
did
follow
froze
them
all
momentarily
that
mangled
body
began
to
move
again
drew
itself
together
crawled
toward
them
dane
knew
that
it
was
impossible
that
the
creature
could
live
with
such
wounds
yet
the
beast
advanced
its
head
lolling
on
its
hunched
shoulders
so
that
the
eyes
were
turned
blindly
up
to
the
full
glare
of
the
sun
while
it
crawled
to
reach
the
man
it
could
not
see
demon
nymani
dropped
his
needler
shrank
back
against
the
rocks
as
the
thing
advanced
before
their
eyes
the
impossible
happened
those
gaping
wounds
closed
the
head
straightened
on
the
almost
invisible
neck
the
eyes
glared
once
more
with
life
and
slaver
dripped
from
the
swine
snout
jellico
caught
up
the
needler
nymani
had
dropped
with
a
coolness
dane
envied
the
captain
shot
and
for
the
second
time
the
rock
ape
collapsed
torn
to
ribbons
nymani
screamed
and
dane
tried
to
choke
back
his
own
cry
of
horrified
protest
the
dead
thing
put
on
life
for
the
second
time
crawled
got
somehow
to
its
feet
healed
itself
and
came
on
asaki
his
face
stepped
out
stiffly
as
if
each
step
he
took
was
forced
by
torture
he
had
dropped
his
needler
now
he
caught
up
a
rock
as
large
as
his
own
head
raised
it
high
with
arms
on
which
the
muscles
stood
out
like
ropes
he
hurled
the
stone
and
dane
heard
as
well
as
saw
the
missile
go
home
the
rock
ape
fell
for
the
third
time
when
one
of
those
taloned
paws
began
to
move
again
nymani
broke
he
ran
his
screams
echoing
thinly
in
the
air
as
the
thing
lurched
up
the
gory
mess
of
its
head
weaving
about
if
his
feet
would
have
obeyed
him
dane
might
have
followed
the
khatkan
as
it
was
he
drew
his
ray
and
aimed
it
at
that
shambling
thing
tau
struck
up
the
barrel
the
medic
face
was
livid
there
was
the
same
horror
in
his
eyes
but
he
moved
out
to
front
that
monster
a
spot
of
shadow
coalesced
on
the
ground
deepened
in
hue
took
on
substance
crouched
low
facing
the
rock
ape
its
haunches
quivering
for
a
deadly
spring
narrowed
green
eyes
holding
on
its
prey
was
a
black
leopard
the
tiny
forward
and
backward
movements
of
its
body
steadied
and
it
arched
through
the
air
brought
down
the
ape
a
pitting
snarling
tangle
rolled
across
the
slope
and
was
gone
asaki
hands
shook
as
he
drew
them
down
his
sweating
face
jellico
readied
a
second
clip
in
the
needler
mechanically
but
tau
was
swaying
so
that
dane
leaped
to
take
the
shock
of
the
other
weight
as
he
collapsed
only
for
a
moment
did
the
medic
hang
so
then
he
struggled
to
stand
erect
magic
jellico
voice
as
controlled
as
ever
broke
the
silence
mass
hallucination
tau
corrected
him
very
strong
how
asaki
swallowed
and
began
again
how
was
it
done
the
medic
shook
his
head
not
by
the
usual
methods
that
is
certain
and
it
worked
on
us
on
me
when
we
were
conditioned
i
understand
that
dane
could
hardly
believe
it
yet
he
watched
jellico
stride
to
where
the
tangle
of
struggling
beasts
had
rolled
saw
him
examine
bare
ground
on
which
no
trace
of
the
fight
remained
they
must
accept
explanation
it
was
the
only
sane
one
asaki
features
were
suddenly
convulsed
with
a
rage
so
stark
that
dane
realized
how
much
a
veneer
was
the
painfully
built
civilization
of
khatka
the
chief
ranger
made
of
that
name
a
curse
then
with
a
visible
effort
he
controlled
his
emotions
and
came
to
tau
looming
over
the
slighter
medic
almost
menacingly
how
he
demanded
for
the
second
time
i
do
know
he
will
try
again
not
the
same
perhaps
but
asaki
had
already
grasped
the
situation
was
looking
ahead
we
shall
not
know
he
breathed
what
is
real
what
is
not
there
is
also
this
tau
warned
the
unreal
can
kill
the
believer
just
as
quickly
as
the
real
that
i
know
also
it
has
happened
too
many
times
lately
if
we
could
only
find
out
how
here
are
no
drums
no
singing
none
of
the
tricks
to
tangle
a
man
mind
that
he
usually
uses
to
summon
his
demons
so
without
lumbrilo
without
his
witch
tools
how
does
he
make
us
see
what
is
not
that
we
must
discover
and
speedily
sir
or
else
we
shall
be
lost
among
the
unreal
and
the
real
you
also
have
the
power
you
can
save
us
asaki
protested
tau
drew
his
arm
across
his
face
very
little
of
the
normal
color
had
returned
to
his
thin
mobile
features
he
still
leaned
against
supporting
arm
a
man
can
do
only
so
much
sir
to
battle
lumbrilo
on
his
own
ground
is
exhausting
and
i
can
not
fight
so
very
often
but
will
he
not
also
be
exhausted
i
wonder
tau
gazed
beyond
the
khatkan
to
the
barren
ground
where
leopard
and
rock
ape
had
ceased
to
be
this
magic
is
a
tricky
thing
sir
it
builds
and
feeds
upon
a
man
own
imagination
and
inner
fears
lumbrilo
having
triggered
ours
need
not
strive
at
all
but
let
us
ourselves
raise
that
which
will
attack
us
drugs
demanded
jellico
tau
gave
a
start
sufficient
to
take
him
out
of
dane
loose
hold
his
hand
went
to
the
packet
of
aid
supplies
which
was
his
own
care
his
eyes
round
with
wonder
and
then
shrewdly
alert
captain
we
disinfected
those
thorn
punctures
of
yours
thorson
your
foot
salve
but
no
i
did
use
anything
you
forget
craig
we
all
had
scratches
after
that
fight
with
the
apes
tau
sat
down
on
the
ground
with
feverish
haste
he
unsealed
his
medical
supplies
laid
out
some
containers
then
delicately
he
opened
each
examined
its
contents
closely
by
eye
by
smell
and
two
by
taste
when
he
was
done
he
shook
his
head
if
these
have
been
in
any
way
meddled
with
i
would
need
laboratory
analysis
to
detect
it
and
i
do
believe
that
lumbrilo
could
hide
traces
of
his
work
so
cleverly
or
has
he
been
had
much
to
do
with
he
asked
the
chief
ranger
by
the
nature
of
his
position
he
is
forbidden
to
space
voyage
to
have
any
close
relationship
with
any
i
do
not
think
medic
he
would
choose
your
healing
substances
for
his
mischief
there
would
only
be
chance
to
aid
him
then
in
producing
the
effects
he
wants
though
there
is
often
call
for
first
aid
in
travel
he
could
not
be
you
would
use
any
of
your
drugs
on
this
trip
to
the
preserve
and
lumbrilo
certain
he
threatened
something
such
as
this
jellico
reminded
them
so
it
would
be
something
which
we
would
all
use
which
we
had
to
depend
upon
the
water
dane
had
been
holding
his
own
canteen
ready
to
drink
but
as
that
possible
explanation
dawned
in
his
mind
he
smelled
instead
of
tasted
the
liquid
sloshing
inside
there
was
no
odor
he
could
detect
but
he
remembered
tau
commenting
on
the
powdered
purifier
pills
at
their
first
camp
that
it
tau
dug
further
into
his
kit
brought
out
the
vial
of
white
powder
with
its
grainy
lumps
pouring
a
little
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
he
smelled
it
touched
it
with
the
tip
of
his
tongue
purifier
and
something
else
he
reported
it
could
be
one
of
half
a
dozen
drugs
or
some
native
stuff
from
here
which
we
never
classified
true
there
are
drugs
we
have
found
here
asaki
scowled
down
at
the
green
mat
of
jungle
so
our
water
is
poisoned
do
you
always
purify
it
tau
asked
the
chief
ranger
surely
during
the
centuries
since
your
ancestors
landed
on
khatka
you
must
have
adapted
to
native
water
you
could
have
lived
otherwise
we
must
use
the
purifier
but
must
you
there
is
water
and
water
asaki
shook
his
own
canteen
his
scowl
growing
fiercer
as
the
gurgle
from
its
depths
was
heard
from
springs
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
we
drink
yes
but
over
here
this
close
to
the
mygra
swamps
we
have
not
done
so
we
may
have
to
chance
it
do
you
think
we
are
literally
poisoned
jellico
bored
directly
to
the
heart
of
their
private
fears
none
of
us
have
been
drinking
too
heavily
tau
observed
thoughtfully
and
i
do
believe
lumbrilo
had
outright
killing
in
mind
how
long
the
effect
will
last
i
have
no
way
of
telling
if
we
saw
one
rock
ape
dane
wondered
why
did
we
see
others
and
why
here
and
now
that
tau
pointed
ahead
on
the
trail
asaki
had
picked
for
their
ascent
for
a
long
moment
dane
could
see
nothing
of
any
interest
there
and
then
he
located
it
a
finger
of
rock
it
did
not
point
directly
skyward
this
time
in
fact
it
slanted
so
that
its
tip
indicated
their
back
trail
yet
in
outline
the
spire
was
very
similar
to
that
outcrop
from
which
the
real
rock
ape
had
charged
them
the
day
before
asaki
exclaimed
in
his
own
tongue
and
slapped
his
hand
hard
against
the
stock
of
the
needler
we
saw
that
and
so
again
we
saw
an
ape
also
had
earlier
we
been
charged
by
graz
or
jumped
by
a
lion
in
such
a
place
then
again
we
would
have
been
faced
by
graz
or
lion
here
captain
jellico
gave
a
bark
of
laughter
colored
only
by
the
most
sardonic
humor
clever
enough
he
merely
leaves
it
to
us
to
select
our
own
ghost
and
then
repeat
the
performance
in
the
next
proper
setting
i
wonder
how
many
rocks
shaped
like
that
one
there
are
in
these
mountains
and
how
long
will
a
rock
ape
continue
to
pop
out
from
behind
each
one
we
do
find
who
knows
but
as
long
as
we
drink
this
water
we
going
to
continue
to
have
trouble
i
feel
safe
in
promising
that
tau
replied
he
put
the
vial
of
doctored
purifier
into
a
separate
pocket
of
his
medical
kit
it
may
be
a
problem
of
how
long
we
can
go
without
water
perhaps
asaki
said
softly
only
not
all
the
water
on
khatka
comes
running
in
streams
fruit
tau
asked
no
trees
lumbrilo
is
not
a
hunter
nor
could
he
be
certain
when
and
where
his
magic
would
go
to
work
unless
the
flitter
was
deliberately
sabotaged
he
was
planning
for
us
to
use
our
canteens
in
the
preserve
that
is
lion
country
and
there
are
long
distances
between
springs
this
is
jungle
below
us
and
there
is
a
source
there
i
think
we
can
safely
tap
but
first
i
must
find
nymani
and
prove
to
him
that
this
is
truly
deviltry
of
a
sort
but
not
demon
inspired
he
was
gone
running
lightly
in
the
direction
his
hunter
had
taken
and
dane
spoke
to
captain
jellico
what
this
about
water
in
trees
sir
there
is
a
species
of
tree
here
not
too
common
with
a
thickened
trunk
it
stores
water
during
the
rainy
season
to
live
on
in
the
hot
months
since
we
are
in
the
transition
period
between
rains
we
could
tap
it
if
we
locate
one
of
the
trees
how
about
that
tau
dare
we
drink
that
without
a
purifier
probably
a
choice
of
two
evils
sir
but
we
have
had
our
preventive
shots
personally
i
rather
battle
disease
than
take
a
chance
on
a
drug
you
can
go
without
water
just
so
long
i
like
to
have
a
little
talk
with
lumbrilo
remarked
jellico
the
mildness
in
his
voice
very
deceptive
i
to
have
a
little
talk
with
lumbrilo
if
and
when
we
see
him
again
promised
tau
what
are
our
chances
sir
dane
asked
he
screwed
the
cap
back
on
his
canteen
his
mouth
feeling
twice
as
dry
since
he
knew
he
dared
not
drink
well
we
faced
gambles
before
tau
sealed
the
medical
kit
like
to
see
one
of
those
trees
before
sundown
and
i
do
want
to
face
another
pointed
rock
today
why
the
leopard
asked
jellico
reflectively
another
case
of
using
flame
to
fight
fire
but
lumbrilo
was
among
those
present
to
be
impressed
tau
rubbed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
i
do
really
know
sir
maybe
i
could
have
made
the
ape
vanish
without
a
counter
projection
but
i
do
think
so
with
these
hallucinations
it
is
better
to
battle
one
vision
against
another
for
the
benefit
of
those
involved
and
i
even
tell
you
why
i
selected
a
leopard
it
just
flashed
into
mind
as
about
the
fastest
and
most
deadly
animal
fighter
i
could
recall
at
that
moment
you
better
work
out
a
good
list
of
such
fighters
jellico
grim
humor
showed
again
i
can
supply
a
few
if
you
need
them
not
that
i
do
share
your
hope
we
wo
see
any
more
trigger
rocks
here
comes
asaki
with
his
wandering
boy
the
chief
ranger
was
his
hunter
and
nymani
seemed
only
tau
got
to
his
feet
and
hurried
to
meet
them
it
would
appear
that
their
search
for
the
water
tree
would
be
delayed
vi
they
withdrew
to
a
spot
hacked
from
the
edge
of
the
jungle
leaving
a
screen
of
green
between
them
and
the
traitorous
but
within
the
few
hours
of
daylight
left
them
it
was
proven
that
asaki
had
been
overly
optimistic
in
his
hopes
of
discovering
a
water
tree
they
were
now
in
a
narrow
tongue
of
land
between
the
range
and
the
swamps
and
this
territory
was
limited
nymani
still
shaken
was
of
little
help
and
the
spacemen
did
not
dare
to
strike
out
into
unexplored
land
alone
so
they
mouthed
dry
concentrates
and
dared
not
drink
dane
was
tempted
to
pour
out
the
liquid
in
his
canteen
water
so
close
to
hand
was
a
continual
torment
and
now
that
they
were
away
from
the
heights
and
the
possibility
of
more
rocks
surely
the
threat
in
that
moisture
was
small
in
comparison
to
the
needs
of
his
body
only
that
caution
which
was
drilled
into
every
free
trader
supplied
a
brake
to
his
thirst
jellico
drew
the
back
of
his
hand
across
cracked
lips
suppose
we
should
draw
lots
some
of
us
drink
one
or
two
not
could
we
manage
that
way
until
we
were
over
the
mountains
i
would
want
to
chance
it
unless
we
are
left
with
no
other
choice
there
is
no
way
of
telling
how
long
the
drug
works
frankly
right
now
i
not
even
sure
i
could
detect
a
hallucination
for
very
long
under
these
conditions
was
tau
discouraging
verdict
if
any
of
them
slept
that
night
they
did
so
only
in
snatches
the
apprehension
which
had
come
with
the
previous
night
was
back
intensified
and
that
lurking
indefinable
fear
rode
them
hard
they
were
shaken
out
of
their
private
terrors
shortly
after
dawn
there
were
always
sounds
to
be
heard
in
the
jungle
the
cries
of
unseen
birds
the
crash
of
some
tree
eaten
alive
by
parasitic
sapping
but
what
broke
now
was
no
bird
call
no
isolated
tree
falling
a
trumpeting
roar
the
crackling
smash
of
vegetation
heralded
a
real
menace
asaki
spun
to
face
northward
though
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
there
except
the
unshaken
wall
of
the
jungle
graz
graz
on
stampede
nymani
joined
his
superior
jellico
arose
swiftly
and
dane
read
on
the
captain
face
the
seriousness
of
this
the
turned
to
his
own
men
with
a
sharp
order
on
your
feet
we
may
have
to
move
on
the
double
he
demanded
of
the
chief
ranger
the
other
was
still
listening
not
only
with
his
ears
but
with
the
whole
of
his
tense
body
three
of
the
creatures
they
had
hunted
for
food
broke
out
of
the
green
wall
fled
past
the
men
as
if
the
latter
was
invisible
and
behind
them
the
hunted
now
and
not
the
hunter
came
a
lion
its
strikingly
marked
hide
dramatic
in
the
light
of
the
morning
it
showed
fangs
in
a
snarl
and
then
was
gone
in
one
huge
bound
more
deer
things
scurrying
of
other
small
creatures
moving
too
fast
for
clear
identification
and
behind
them
the
fury
of
destruction
which
marked
the
headlong
advance
of
khatka
largest
mammals
slamming
through
the
jungle
they
had
started
when
nymani
cried
out
a
white
bulk
hard
to
distinguish
in
that
light
against
the
gray
of
the
earth
headed
after
them
dane
had
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
curled
tusks
of
an
open
mouth
and
wide
enough
to
engulf
his
whole
head
of
shaggy
legs
driving
at
an
unbelievable
pace
asaki
snapped
a
beam
from
the
needler
the
white
monster
roared
and
came
on
they
dived
for
the
scant
cover
offered
as
the
graz
bull
died
not
two
yards
away
from
the
chief
ranger
its
heavy
body
skidding
along
the
earth
with
the
force
of
its
speed
as
it
went
down
that
did
it
jellico
sighted
coolly
with
his
blaster
as
a
second
bull
fighting
mad
tore
from
the
jungle
and
pounded
at
them
behind
it
a
third
tusked
head
thrust
out
of
the
brush
large
eyes
searched
for
an
enemy
dane
studied
the
dead
bull
but
the
animal
did
not
come
to
life
this
time
these
were
not
hallucinations
and
the
malignancy
of
the
rock
apes
the
cunning
of
the
native
khatkan
lion
were
pallid
things
compared
to
a
graz
herd
on
the
rampage
the
second
bull
yelped
with
an
almost
canine
complaint
as
blaster
caught
it
blinded
the
beast
blundered
ahead
climbing
the
mountain
side
the
third
met
a
ray
from
nymani
needler
but
the
chief
ranger
leaped
from
behind
his
sheltering
rock
to
the
one
where
the
captain
had
taken
refuge
and
pulled
him
into
the
open
they
must
not
corner
us
here
jellico
agreed
to
that
come
on
he
barked
to
tau
and
dane
they
fled
along
a
rough
way
trying
to
gain
altitude
but
finding
a
rising
cliff
wall
which
could
not
be
easily
climbed
two
more
graz
went
down
one
badly
wounded
one
safely
dead
behind
them
more
white
heads
came
from
the
brush
what
original
cause
had
started
the
stampede
the
fugitives
could
not
guess
but
now
the
fear
and
anger
of
the
animals
were
centering
upon
them
and
in
spite
of
their
efforts
the
party
was
being
herded
into
a
pocket
between
the
jungle
below
where
the
main
body
of
graz
crashed
along
and
a
steep
wall
given
time
to
find
the
necessary
finger
and
toe
holds
a
man
might
climb
that
wall
but
they
could
not
attempt
it
now
the
portion
of
ledge
on
which
they
ran
stopped
to
fire
and
then
ran
on
again
angled
to
the
southeast
and
so
they
came
to
its
end
quickly
a
drop
ending
in
a
plain
of
mud
studded
with
clumps
of
bleached
vegetation
which
led
like
steppingstones
toward
a
tangle
of
matted
sickly
looking
plants
and
reeds
all
right
tau
faced
around
what
do
we
do
now
space
lift
and
using
what
for
wings
or
jets
as
if
the
graz
could
sense
that
they
now
had
their
victims
safely
cornered
what
must
have
been
a
goodly
segment
of
the
herd
hooked
their
way
from
the
jungle
and
started
up
puffing
digging
in
those
sturdy
legs
which
had
to
take
the
massive
weight
of
their
bodies
they
made
their
way
determinedly
one
might
almost
believe
that
they
had
intelligently
planned
this
end
for
their
drive
we
go
down
asaki
yelled
and
used
his
needler
on
the
leader
of
that
climbing
platoon
the
brush
islands
nymani
amended
i
show
you
he
thrust
his
needler
at
jellico
and
was
over
the
edge
of
the
ledge
hanging
by
his
hands
and
swinging
his
weight
back
and
forth
like
a
pendulum
at
the
of
his
body
to
the
right
he
let
go
and
plunged
out
landing
half
across
one
of
the
reed
islets
the
khatkan
clawed
his
way
to
his
knees
gained
his
feet
and
leaped
for
the
next
bit
of
solid
ground
you
thorson
jellico
jerked
his
head
at
dane
and
the
younger
spaceman
holstered
his
fire
ray
slipped
gingerly
over
the
drop
and
prepared
to
repeat
nymani
feat
as
best
he
could
he
was
not
quite
as
successful
with
his
sidewise
swing
landing
with
only
his
forearms
across
the
islet
the
rest
of
his
body
being
swiftly
embedded
in
what
was
ooze
covered
only
with
a
thin
crust
of
dried
matter
the
stench
of
the
stuff
was
sickening
but
the
fear
of
being
entrapped
in
it
gave
him
the
necessary
impetus
to
push
forward
though
what
was
meant
to
be
a
swift
was
more
of
a
worm
progress
he
grabbed
frantically
at
brittle
stems
at
coarse
grass
which
cut
like
knives
at
his
hands
but
some
of
the
material
held
and
he
lay
face
down
on
a
lump
which
did
not
give
under
his
weight
there
was
no
time
to
linger
he
had
to
get
to
the
next
patch
to
free
this
dubious
landing
place
for
the
men
embattled
on
the
rise
above
stumbling
up
dane
judged
the
distance
with
a
eye
and
jumped
to
a
knob
nymani
had
already
quitted
the
khatkan
was
more
than
halfway
along
toward
that
promise
of
solid
ground
which
the
tangled
mass
of
leprous
vegetation
led
to
zigzagging
expertly
from
islet
to
islet
there
was
a
crash
and
a
roar
behind
dane
balanced
on
the
third
of
the
minute
islands
to
look
back
he
saw
the
lash
of
blaster
fire
on
the
top
of
the
cliff
tau
on
his
knees
on
the
first
of
their
chain
of
steppingstones
and
a
graz
sprawled
head
and
forequarters
in
the
sucking
muck
where
it
had
dived
past
the
two
defenders
above
needler
and
blaster
fired
together
again
and
then
jellico
swung
over
the
cliff
rim
tau
waved
vigorously
and
dane
took
off
for
the
next
islet
just
making
it
by
lucky
chance
the
rest
of
the
journey
he
took
in
a
rush
trying
not
to
think
of
anything
but
the
necessity
of
landing
on
some
spot
of
firm
ground
his
last
leap
of
all
was
too
short
so
that
he
went
knee
deep
in
a
particularly
pool
where
yellow
scum
spattered
his
breeches
and
he
experienced
the
insidious
pull
of
the
bottomless
stuff
a
stout
branch
whipped
across
his
shoulder
and
he
caught
it
with
nymani
wiry
strength
on
the
other
end
dane
worked
free
and
sat
and
shivering
on
a
mat
of
brush
while
the
khatkan
hunter
turned
his
attention
to
the
safety
of
tau
the
next
arrival
more
fortunate
or
more
skillful
than
dane
the
medic
made
the
hop
from
the
last
tuft
without
mishap
but
he
was
blowing
heavily
as
he
collapsed
beside
the
other
spaceman
together
they
watched
the
progress
of
their
captain
safe
on
the
second
tussock
from
the
shore
jellico
halted
edged
carefully
around
and
used
the
needler
nymani
had
left
with
him
a
shaggy
head
tossed
and
the
bull
fronting
asaki
on
the
cliff
went
down
the
chief
ranger
dodged
quickly
to
the
right
and
a
second
beast
rushed
out
and
over
to
join
its
mired
comrade
in
the
swamp
below
as
jellico
shot
again
the
khatkan
slung
his
needler
and
went
over
to
gain
the
first
islet
one
more
graz
was
wounded
but
luckily
it
hunched
about
turning
its
formidable
tusks
on
those
that
followed
thus
keeping
the
path
clear
for
its
enemies
jellico
was
making
the
journey
with
the
chief
ranger
only
one
hillock
behind
tau
sighed
someday
maybe
this
will
be
just
another
tall
tale
and
we
all
be
thought
liars
when
we
spout
it
he
observed
that
is
if
we
survive
to
tell
it
so
now
which
way
do
we
go
if
i
had
my
choice
it
would
be
up
when
dane
pulled
himself
to
his
feet
and
surveyed
their
small
refuge
he
was
ready
to
agree
to
that
for
the
space
packed
with
dead
and
dying
vegetable
matter
until
one
sank
calf
deep
was
a
triangle
with
a
narrow
point
running
east
into
the
swamp
they
do
give
up
easily
do
they
jellico
looked
back
to
the
shore
and
the
cliff
though
the
wounded
graz
bull
still
held
the
heights
against
its
fellows
there
were
others
breaking
from
the
jungle
on
the
lower
level
wandering
back
and
forth
to
paw
the
earth
rip
up
soil
with
their
tusks
and
otherwise
threaten
anyone
who
would
try
to
return
to
the
strip
they
patrolled
they
will
not
asaki
answered
bleakly
arouse
a
graz
and
it
will
trail
you
for
days
kill
any
of
the
herd
and
you
have
little
hope
of
escaping
them
on
foot
it
would
seem
now
that
the
swamp
was
a
deterrent
to
pursuit
the
two
beasts
that
had
fallen
in
the
mire
moaned
in
a
pitiful
rising
note
they
had
ceased
to
struggle
and
several
of
their
kind
clustered
on
the
shore
near
them
calling
entreatingly
asaki
took
careful
aim
with
the
needler
and
put
one
animal
after
another
out
of
its
misery
but
the
flash
of
those
shots
angered
those
on
shore
to
a
higher
pitch
of
rage
no
going
back
he
said
at
least
not
for
several
days
tau
slapped
a
black
insect
which
had
settled
on
his
arm
its
jaws
wide
open
for
a
sampling
bite
we
ca
very
well
perch
here
until
they
forget
all
about
us
he
pointed
out
not
without
water
we
can
trust
and
with
the
local
wild
life
ready
to
test
us
for
tasty
eating
nymani
had
prowled
along
the
swampward
point
of
their
island
and
now
he
made
his
report
there
is
more
high
land
to
the
east
perhaps
it
will
give
us
a
bridge
across
at
that
moment
dane
doubted
his
ability
to
make
any
more
leaps
from
island
to
island
and
it
would
seem
tau
shared
his
discouragement
i
do
suppose
you
could
discourage
our
friends
on
shore
there
with
a
few
more
shots
asaki
shook
his
head
we
do
not
have
clips
enough
to
settle
a
whole
herd
these
might
retreat
from
sight
but
they
would
be
waiting
for
us
in
the
bush
and
that
would
mean
certain
death
we
shall
have
to
take
the
swamp
road
if
dane
had
considered
their
earlier
march
misery
this
was
sheer
torture
since
footing
was
never
secure
falls
were
frequent
and
within
a
they
were
all
plastered
with
slime
and
mud
which
hardened
to
rock
consistency
when
exposed
to
the
air
painful
as
this
was
it
did
protect
a
portion
of
their
bodies
from
the
insects
with
which
the
swamp
was
well
stocked
and
in
spite
of
their
efforts
to
find
a
way
out
the
only
possible
paths
led
them
deeper
into
the
center
of
the
unexplored
morass
at
last
asaki
called
a
halt
and
a
council
to
consider
retreat
to
locate
an
island
from
which
they
could
at
least
watch
the
shore
appealed
very
strongly
indeed
we
have
to
have
water
tau
voice
was
a
harsh
croak
issuing
out
of
a
mask
of
green
mud
festooned
with
trailing
weeds
this
ground
is
rising
asaki
smacked
the
stock
of
his
needler
against
the
surface
on
which
he
crouched
i
think
perhaps
there
may
be
clean
land
soon
to
come
jellico
hitched
his
way
up
a
sapling
now
bending
under
his
weight
through
the
vision
lenses
he
studied
the
route
ahead
you
right
about
that
he
called
to
the
chief
ranger
there
a
showing
of
the
right
sort
of
green
to
the
left
about
half
a
mile
on
and
he
glanced
about
at
the
westering
sun
we
have
about
an
hour
yet
of
good
light
in
which
to
make
it
i
would
try
such
a
run
after
dark
that
promise
of
green
bolstered
their
weary
spirits
for
a
last
exhausting
effort
once
again
they
were
faced
with
a
series
of
islet
leaps
and
now
they
carried
with
them
brush
culled
from
the
bigger
tussocks
to
aid
in
times
of
need
when
dane
scrambled
up
the
last
pull
staggered
and
went
down
to
his
knees
again
he
knew
he
was
done
he
did
not
even
move
at
an
excited
cry
from
nymani
echoed
a
moment
later
by
asaki
it
was
not
until
the
latter
leaned
over
him
a
canteen
open
in
his
hand
that
dane
aroused
a
little
drink
the
khatkan
urged
we
have
found
a
water
tree
this
is
fresh
the
liquid
might
have
been
fresh
but
it
also
had
a
peculiar
taste
which
dane
did
not
note
until
he
had
gulped
down
a
generous
swallow
at
that
moment
he
was
past
caring
about
anything
but
the
fact
that
he
did
have
a
portion
of
drinkable
stuff
in
hand
here
the
stunted
unnatural
growth
of
the
swamplands
had
given
away
to
the
more
normal
vegetation
of
the
lowlands
had
they
come
clear
across
the
swamp
dane
wondered
dully
or
was
this
only
a
large
island
in
the
midst
of
the
stinking
boglands
he
drank
again
and
regained
strength
enough
to
crawl
to
where
his
shipmates
lay
it
was
some
time
before
he
was
interested
in
much
besides
the
fact
that
he
could
drink
when
he
wished
then
he
watched
jellico
waver
to
his
feet
his
head
turned
eastward
tau
too
sat
up
as
if
alerted
by
the
alarm
buzzer
the
khatkans
were
gone
perhaps
back
to
the
water
tree
but
all
three
of
the
spacemen
heard
that
sound
a
far
off
throbbing
rhythm
which
was
a
vibration
as
well
jellico
looked
to
tau
drums
could
be
the
medic
screwed
the
cap
back
on
his
canteen
i
say
we
have
company
only
i
like
to
know
what
kind
they
might
have
been
mistaken
about
the
drums
but
none
of
them
could
have
been
mistaken
about
the
bolt
which
came
out
of
nowhere
to
slice
through
a
tree
trunk
as
a
knife
might
slash
wet
clay
blaster
and
a
particular
type
of
blaster
patrol
issue
tau
lay
flat
squeezing
himself
against
the
earth
as
if
he
wished
he
could
ooze
into
it
jellico
wriggled
toward
the
bush
in
answer
to
a
low
call
from
asaki
and
the
others
made
a
worm
progress
in
his
wake
under
cover
they
found
the
chief
ranger
readying
his
needler
poacher
camp
here
he
explained
bleakly
and
they
know
about
us
a
perfect
end
to
a
stinking
day
remarked
tau
dispassionately
we
might
have
guessed
something
of
this
sort
was
waiting
he
tried
to
rub
away
some
of
the
dried
clay
coating
his
chin
but
do
poachers
use
drums
the
chief
ranger
scowled
that
is
what
nymani
has
gone
to
find
out
vii
darkness
closed
in
while
they
waited
for
nymani
return
there
had
been
no
further
attack
from
the
blaster
wielder
perhaps
he
was
only
trying
to
pin
them
down
where
they
were
out
over
the
swamp
weird
patches
of
phosphorescence
moved
in
small
ghostly
clouds
and
bright
dots
of
insects
with
their
own
lighting
systems
flashed
or
sailed
serenely
on
regular
flight
plans
at
night
the
wonder
of
the
place
was
far
removed
from
the
squalid
reality
of
the
day
they
chewed
on
their
rations
drank
sparingly
of
the
water
and
tried
to
keep
alert
to
any
sight
or
sound
that
monotonous
undertone
which
might
or
might
not
be
drums
continued
as
a
basic
hum
to
the
noises
of
the
night
drowned
out
at
intervals
by
a
splash
a
mutter
or
cry
from
some
swamp
creature
beside
dane
jellico
stiffened
moved
his
blaster
as
someone
wriggled
through
the
brush
trilling
softly
nymani
reported
in
gasps
to
asaki
and
outlaws
too
they
make
a
hunting
sing
tomorrow
they
march
for
a
killing
asaki
rested
his
chin
on
his
broad
forearm
outlaws
they
show
no
lord
badge
but
each
i
saw
wears
a
bracelet
of
three
five
or
ten
tails
they
are
trackers
indeed
and
hunters
of
the
best
they
have
huts
not
so
there
are
no
dwellers
in
the
inners
courts
here
out
of
habit
nymani
used
the
polite
term
for
the
women
of
his
race
i
would
say
they
tarry
only
for
the
space
of
a
hunt
and
on
the
boots
of
one
i
saw
salt
crust
salt
crust
asaki
snapped
and
half
arose
so
that
is
the
type
of
lure
they
use
there
must
be
a
saline
mire
near
here
to
pull
game
how
many
jellico
broke
in
three
who
are
hunters
one
who
is
different
how
different
questioned
asaki
he
wears
upon
his
body
garments
which
are
strange
on
his
head
a
round
covering
such
as
we
see
upon
the
of
the
ships
a
spaceman
asaki
laughed
harshly
why
not
they
must
have
some
method
of
transporting
their
hides
you
ca
tell
me
jellico
returned
that
anyone
is
able
to
set
a
ship
down
in
this
muck
it
would
simply
be
buried
for
all
time
but
captain
what
type
of
a
spaceport
does
a
free
trader
need
do
you
not
planet
your
own
ship
on
worlds
where
there
are
no
waiting
cradles
no
fitter
shops
none
of
the
conveniences
such
as
mark
the
field
combine
maintains
on
xecho
of
course
i
do
but
one
does
need
a
reasonably
smooth
stretch
of
territory
open
enough
so
the
tail
flames
wo
start
a
forest
fire
you
do
ever
ride
a
tail
push
down
in
a
swamp
which
testifies
to
a
trail
out
of
here
fairly
and
some
kind
of
a
usable
landing
space
not
too
far
away
asaki
replied
and
that
could
very
well
serve
us
but
they
know
we
are
here
tau
pointed
out
it
was
nymani
turn
to
laugh
man
from
the
stars
there
is
no
trail
so
that
a
ranger
of
the
preserves
can
not
nose
it
out
nor
any
hunter
be
he
a
two
or
five
bracelet
veteran
who
can
keep
pinned
down
a
determined
man
of
the
forest
service
dane
lost
interest
in
the
argument
at
that
moment
he
was
at
the
edge
of
their
line
the
nearest
to
the
swamp
and
he
had
been
watching
patches
of
ghostly
light
flitting
above
the
rank
for
the
past
few
moments
those
wisps
of
faded
radiance
had
been
gathering
into
a
growing
anthropomorphic
blot
hanging
over
the
morass
several
yards
away
and
the
misty
outlines
were
now
assuming
more
concrete
shape
he
watched
unable
to
believe
in
what
he
was
seeing
at
first
the
general
outline
as
it
was
made
him
think
of
a
rock
ape
but
there
were
no
pointed
ears
above
the
round
skull
no
snout
on
the
visage
turned
in
profile
toward
him
more
and
more
patches
of
swamp
luminescence
were
drawn
to
that
glowing
figure
what
balanced
there
now
as
if
walking
the
treacherous
surface
of
the
swampland
was
no
animal
it
was
a
man
or
the
semblance
of
one
a
small
thin
man
a
man
he
had
seen
once
before
on
the
terrace
of
asaki
mountain
fortress
the
thing
stood
almost
complete
its
head
cocked
in
what
was
an
attitude
of
listening
lumbrilo
dane
identified
it
still
knowing
that
the
witch
doctor
could
not
be
standing
there
listening
for
them
but
to
shake
him
still
farther
the
head
turned
at
his
cry
only
there
were
no
eyes
no
features
on
the
white
expanse
which
should
have
been
a
face
and
somehow
that
made
the
monster
more
menacing
convincing
dane
against
sane
logic
that
the
thing
spying
on
them
demon
that
was
nymani
and
over
his
sudden
quaver
robbed
of
all
the
confidence
which
had
been
there
only
moments
earlier
came
demand
what
stands
there
medic
tell
us
that
a
whip
to
drive
us
out
of
hiding
sir
as
you
know
as
well
as
i
if
nymani
spied
upon
them
then
they
have
spied
upon
us
in
turn
and
this
i
think
also
answers
another
question
if
there
is
a
canker
of
trouble
on
khatka
then
lumbrilo
is
close
to
its
root
nymani
the
chief
ranger
voice
was
the
crack
of
a
lash
will
you
forget
again
that
you
are
a
man
and
run
crying
for
shelter
against
a
shaft
of
light
as
this
medic
says
lumbrilo
fashions
such
as
that
to
drive
us
into
our
enemies
hands
the
shadow
thing
in
the
swamp
moved
putting
its
foot
forward
on
surface
which
would
not
bear
the
weight
of
a
human
body
taking
a
deliberate
step
and
then
another
heading
for
the
concealing
brush
where
the
fugitives
lay
can
you
get
rid
of
it
tau
jellico
asked
in
his
usual
crisp
voice
he
might
have
been
inquiring
about
some
problem
aboard
the
i
rather
get
at
the
source
there
was
a
grim
note
in
the
reply
and
to
do
that
i
want
to
look
at
their
camp
well
enough
asaki
crept
back
in
the
brush
the
ghost
of
that
which
was
not
a
man
had
reached
the
shore
of
the
island
stood
there
its
blank
head
turned
toward
them
weird
as
it
was
now
that
the
first
shock
of
sighting
it
was
over
the
spacemen
could
accept
and
dismiss
it
as
they
had
not
been
so
able
to
dismiss
the
phantom
rock
ape
if
that
thing
was
sent
to
drive
us
dane
ventured
would
we
be
playing
their
game
by
going
inland
now
the
chief
ranger
did
not
pause
in
his
crawl
to
the
left
i
think
not
they
do
not
expect
us
to
arrive
with
our
wits
about
us
men
are
easy
to
pull
down
this
time
lumbrilo
has
overreached
himself
had
he
not
played
that
game
with
the
rock
ape
he
might
have
been
able
to
stampede
us
now
though
the
white
thing
continued
to
move
inland
it
did
not
change
course
to
fall
in
behind
them
on
the
new
route
whatever
it
was
it
did
not
possess
a
mind
there
was
a
rustling
faint
but
distinguishable
then
dane
caught
nymani
whisper
the
one
left
to
watch
the
inland
trail
does
so
no
longer
we
need
not
fear
an
alarm
from
also
here
is
another
blaster
for
our
use
away
from
the
open
by
the
swamp
the
gloom
was
deeper
dane
was
guided
only
by
the
noises
of
the
jellico
and
tau
made
in
their
progress
they
edged
down
into
a
small
cut
floored
with
reeds
and
mud
where
some
of
the
moisture
from
the
soggy
land
about
them
gathered
into
a
half
pool
straight
through
this
swale
the
khatkans
set
course
the
drum
beat
grew
louder
now
there
was
a
glow
against
the
dark
fire
ahead
dane
squirmed
forward
and
at
last
gained
a
vantage
point
from
which
to
survey
the
poachers
camp
there
were
shelters
erected
there
three
of
them
but
they
were
mainly
roofs
of
leaves
and
branches
in
two
of
them
were
stored
bales
of
hides
sewn
into
plastic
cloth
ready
to
ship
before
the
third
hut
lounged
four
and
nymani
was
very
right
one
of
them
wore
uniform
to
the
right
of
the
fire
was
a
ring
of
natives
and
another
man
slightly
apart
who
beat
the
drum
but
of
the
witch
doctor
there
was
no
sign
and
dane
thinking
of
that
thing
at
the
swamp
edge
shivered
he
could
believe
tau
explanation
of
the
drug
which
produced
hallucinations
back
on
the
mountain
side
but
how
that
likeness
fashioned
of
phosphorescence
had
been
sent
by
an
absent
man
to
hunt
his
enemies
was
a
eerie
puzzle
lumbrilo
is
not
here
nymani
thoughts
must
have
been
moving
along
the
same
path
dane
could
hear
movements
in
the
dark
beside
him
there
a
com
unit
in
that
third
hut
tau
observed
so
i
see
jellico
snapped
could
you
reach
your
men
over
the
mountain
with
that
sir
i
do
not
know
but
if
lumbrilo
is
not
here
how
can
he
make
his
image
walk
the
night
the
chief
ranger
demanded
impatiently
we
shall
see
if
lumbrilo
is
not
here
he
shall
come
and
the
promise
in
tau
tone
was
sure
those
will
have
to
be
out
of
action
first
and
with
that
walking
thing
sent
to
drive
us
in
they
must
be
waiting
for
us
if
they
have
sentries
out
i
will
silence
them
promised
nymani
you
have
a
plan
asaki
wide
shoulders
and
upheld
head
showed
for
an
instant
against
the
light
from
the
camp
you
want
lumbrilo
tau
replied
very
well
sir
i
believe
i
can
give
him
to
you
and
in
the
doing
discredit
him
with
your
khatkans
but
not
with
the
free
to
move
the
program
was
not
going
to
be
easy
dane
decided
every
one
of
the
poachers
was
armed
with
a
patrol
blaster
of
the
latest
type
and
a
small
part
of
his
mind
speculated
as
to
what
would
be
the
result
of
that
information
conveyed
to
official
quarters
free
traders
and
patrolmen
did
not
always
see
over
the
proper
action
to
be
taken
on
the
galactic
frontier
the
crew
had
had
one
such
brush
with
authority
in
the
immediate
past
but
each
realized
that
the
other
had
an
important
role
in
the
general
scheme
of
things
and
if
it
came
to
a
clash
between
the
law
and
outlaws
free
traders
fought
beside
the
patrol
why
not
give
them
what
they
expect
with
reservations
inquired
jellico
they
set
us
up
to
be
stampeded
into
camp
flying
ahead
of
that
tame
ghost
of
theirs
suppose
we
do
stampede
after
nymani
has
removed
any
sentries
stampede
so
well
we
sweep
right
over
them
i
want
to
get
at
that
com
unit
you
do
think
they
just
mow
us
down
as
we
come
in
you
delivered
a
blow
to
lumbrilo
pride
he
wo
be
satisfied
with
just
your
burning
the
captain
answered
tau
not
if
i
any
judge
of
character
and
we
furnish
hostages
of
a
sort
especially
the
chief
ranger
no
if
they
had
wanted
to
kill
us
they
would
have
shot
us
off
those
islands
when
we
came
here
there
would
have
been
no
playing
around
with
ghosts
and
goblins
there
is
reason
in
your
words
and
it
is
true
they
would
like
to
have
me
those
outlaws
down
there
asaki
commented
i
am
of
the
magawaya
and
we
have
pressed
always
for
stronger
security
methods
to
be
used
against
such
as
they
but
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
take
the
camp
we
wo
go
in
from
the
front
as
they
expect
us
to
do
but
a
try
from
the
north
getting
at
the
first
three
men
causing
enough
disturbance
to
cover
operations
of
the
other
two
so
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
as
the
chief
ranger
evaluated
that
then
he
added
a
few
comments
of
his
own
that
who
wears
spaceman
clothing
his
weapon
is
not
drawn
though
the
others
are
ready
but
i
believe
that
you
are
right
in
thinking
they
expect
to
be
warned
by
sentries
those
we
can
see
to
suppose
then
captain
you
and
i
play
the
men
running
from
demons
nymani
will
cover
us
from
the
dark
and
your
two
men
tau
spoke
up
give
me
leave
to
flush
out
our
other
quarry
sir
i
believe
i
can
keep
him
occupied
dane
you
take
the
drum
drum
with
his
mind
on
blasters
it
was
startling
to
be
offered
a
it
your
business
to
get
that
drum
and
when
you
get
it
i
want
you
to
beat
out
bound
you
certainly
can
play
that
ca
you
i
do
understand
dane
began
and
then
swallowed
the
rest
of
his
protest
knowing
that
tau
was
not
going
to
explain
why
he
needed
to
have
the
hackneyed
popular
song
of
the
spaceways
played
in
a
khatkan
swamp
as
a
free
trader
he
had
had
quite
a
few
odd
jobs
handed
him
during
the
past
couple
of
years
but
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
been
ordered
to
serve
as
a
musician
they
waited
for
nymani
through
dragging
minutes
surely
those
in
the
camp
would
expect
their
arrival
soon
now
dane
fire
ray
was
in
his
hand
as
he
measured
the
distance
to
the
drummer
stand
it
is
done
nymani
whispered
from
the
darkness
behind
them
jellico
and
the
chief
ranger
moved
to
the
left
tau
crept
to
the
right
and
dane
pushed
level
with
the
medic
when
they
move
tau
lips
were
beside
his
ear
jump
for
that
drum
i
do
care
how
you
get
it
but
get
it
and
keep
it
yes
sir
there
was
a
wailing
cry
from
the
north
a
howl
of
witless
fear
the
singers
stopped
in
the
drummer
paused
his
hand
uplifted
dane
darted
forward
in
a
plunge
which
carried
him
to
that
man
the
khatkan
did
not
have
time
to
rise
from
his
knees
as
the
barrel
of
the
fire
rod
struck
his
head
sending
him
spinning
then
the
drum
was
cradled
in
the
spaceman
arm
close
to
his
chest
his
weapon
aimed
across
it
at
the
startled
natives
the
crackle
of
blaster
fire
the
shrill
whine
of
needlers
in
action
raised
a
bedlam
from
the
other
end
of
the
camp
backing
up
a
little
dane
went
down
on
one
knee
his
weapon
ready
to
sweep
over
the
bewildered
natives
the
drum
resting
on
the
earth
against
his
body
keeping
the
fire
rod
steady
his
left
hand
went
to
work
not
in
the
muted
cadence
the
khatkan
drummer
had
chosen
but
in
hard
and
vigorous
thumps
which
rolled
across
the
clamor
of
the
fight
there
was
no
forgetting
the
beat
of
terra
bound
and
he
delivered
it
with
force
so
that
the
familiar
droned
loud
enough
to
awaken
the
whole
camp
dane
move
appeared
to
completely
baffle
the
khatkan
outlaws
they
stared
at
him
the
whites
of
their
eyes
doubly
noticeable
in
their
dark
faces
their
mouths
a
little
agape
as
usual
the
unexpected
had
driven
them
off
guard
he
dared
not
look
away
from
that
gathering
to
see
how
the
fight
at
the
other
end
of
the
camp
was
progressing
but
he
did
see
tau
advance
the
medic
came
into
the
light
of
the
fire
not
with
his
ordinary
spaceman
stride
but
mincingly
with
a
dancing
step
and
he
was
singing
to
the
drum
beat
of
terra
bound
dane
could
not
understand
the
words
but
he
knew
that
they
patterned
in
and
out
of
the
drum
beats
weaving
a
net
between
singer
and
listeners
as
lumbrilo
had
woven
his
net
on
the
mountain
terrace
tau
had
them
had
every
one
of
the
native
outlaws
ensnared
so
that
dane
rested
his
weapon
across
his
knee
and
took
up
the
lower
beat
with
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
as
well
the
innocuous
repetitive
refrain
of
the
original
song
which
had
been
repeating
itself
in
his
mind
faded
and
somehow
he
caught
the
menace
in
the
new
words
tau
was
mouthing
twice
the
medic
shuffled
about
a
circle
of
his
own
making
then
he
stooped
took
a
hunting
knife
from
the
belt
of
the
nearest
khatkan
and
held
it
point
out
toward
the
dark
east
dane
would
not
have
believed
the
medic
knew
the
drill
he
now
displayed
for
with
no
opponent
save
the
dancing
firelight
he
fought
a
knife
duel
feinting
striking
twisting
retreating
attacking
all
in
time
to
the
beat
of
the
drum
dane
was
no
longer
conscious
of
playing
and
as
he
strove
it
was
very
easy
to
picture
another
fighting
against
him
so
that
when
the
knife
came
up
in
a
vicious
thrust
which
was
the
finish
of
his
last
attack
dane
stared
stupidly
at
the
ground
half
expecting
to
see
a
body
lying
there
once
more
tau
ceremoniously
saluted
with
his
blade
to
the
east
then
he
laid
it
on
the
ground
and
stood
astride
its
gleaming
length
lumbrilo
his
confident
voice
arose
above
the
call
of
the
drum
lumbrilo
i
am
waiting
viii
vaguely
aware
that
the
clamor
at
the
other
end
of
the
camp
had
died
away
dane
muted
the
sound
of
his
drum
over
its
round
top
he
could
watch
the
khatkan
outlaws
their
heads
bobbed
and
swayed
in
time
to
the
beat
of
his
fingers
he
too
could
feel
the
pull
of
tau
voice
but
what
would
come
in
answer
that
shadowy
thing
which
had
been
loosed
to
drive
them
here
or
the
man
himself
to
dane
the
ruddy
light
of
the
fire
dimmed
yet
there
was
no
actual
dying
of
those
flames
which
coiled
and
thrust
around
the
wood
and
the
acrid
scent
of
burning
was
thick
how
much
of
what
followed
was
real
how
much
the
product
of
his
tense
nerves
dane
was
never
afterwards
able
to
tell
in
fact
whether
all
the
witnesses
there
saw
the
same
sights
could
be
questioned
did
each
man
khatkan
and
see
only
what
his
particular
set
of
emotions
and
memories
dictated
something
swept
in
from
the
east
something
which
was
not
as
tangible
as
the
creature
born
of
swamp
mist
rather
it
came
as
an
unseen
menace
to
the
fire
and
all
that
fire
signifies
to
human
kind
security
comradeship
a
weapon
against
the
forces
of
the
dangerous
night
was
that
threat
too
only
in
their
minds
or
had
lumbrilo
some
power
to
so
shape
his
hatred
the
unseen
was
cold
it
sapped
a
man
strength
bit
at
his
brain
weighted
his
hands
and
feet
weakened
him
it
strove
to
soften
him
into
clay
another
could
remold
nothingness
darkness
all
that
was
opposed
to
life
and
warmth
and
reality
arose
in
the
night
gathered
together
against
them
yet
still
tau
fronted
that
invisible
wave
his
head
high
and
between
his
sturdily
planted
feet
the
knife
gleamed
bright
with
a
radiance
of
its
own
ahhh
tau
voice
curled
out
to
pierce
that
creeping
menace
then
he
was
singing
again
the
cadence
of
his
unknown
words
rising
a
little
above
the
pattern
wrought
by
the
drum
dane
forced
his
heavy
hands
to
continue
the
beat
his
wrists
to
rise
and
fall
in
defiance
of
that
which
crept
to
eat
their
strength
and
make
them
less
then
men
lumbrilo
i
tau
of
another
star
another
sky
another
world
bid
you
come
forth
and
range
your
power
against
mine
now
there
was
a
sharper
note
in
that
demand
the
snap
of
an
order
he
was
answered
by
another
wave
of
the
black
negation
stronger
rolling
up
to
smash
them
down
as
a
wave
in
the
heavy
surf
of
a
wild
ocean
pounds
its
force
against
the
beach
this
time
dane
thought
he
could
see
that
dark
mass
he
tore
his
eyes
away
before
it
took
on
substance
concentrating
on
the
movements
of
his
hands
against
the
drum
head
refusing
to
believe
that
hammer
of
power
was
rising
to
flatten
them
all
he
had
heard
tau
describe
such
things
in
the
past
but
told
in
familiar
quarters
on
board
the
such
experiences
were
only
stories
here
was
danger
unleashed
yet
the
medic
stood
unbowed
as
the
wave
broke
upon
him
in
full
and
advancing
under
the
crest
of
that
lick
of
destruction
came
its
controller
this
was
no
ghost
drawn
from
the
materials
of
the
swamp
this
was
a
man
walking
quietly
his
hands
as
empty
as
tau
yet
grasping
weapons
none
of
them
could
see
in
the
firelight
as
the
wave
receded
sullenly
men
moaned
lay
face
down
upon
the
ground
beat
their
hands
feebly
against
the
earth
but
as
lumbrilo
came
on
from
the
shadows
one
of
them
got
to
his
hands
and
knees
moving
with
small
tortured
jerks
he
crawled
toward
tau
his
head
lolling
on
his
shoulders
as
the
head
of
the
dead
rock
ape
had
done
dane
patted
the
drum
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
groped
for
his
fire
ray
he
tried
to
shout
in
warning
and
found
that
he
could
not
utter
a
sound
tau
arm
moved
raised
from
his
side
made
a
circling
motion
the
creeping
man
his
eyes
rolled
up
in
his
head
until
only
the
whites
gleamed
blindly
in
the
limited
light
followed
that
gesture
he
drew
level
with
the
medic
passed
beyond
toward
lumbrilo
whining
as
a
hound
prevented
from
obeying
his
master
might
lament
so
be
it
lumbrilo
tau
said
this
is
between
you
and
me
or
do
you
not
dare
to
risk
your
power
against
mine
is
lumbrilo
so
weak
a
one
that
he
must
send
another
to
do
his
will
raising
both
hands
again
the
medic
brought
them
down
curling
inward
until
he
stooped
and
touched
them
to
the
ground
when
he
straightened
once
again
the
knife
was
in
his
grasp
and
he
tossed
it
behind
him
the
smoke
from
the
fire
swirled
out
in
a
long
tongue
coiled
about
lumbrilo
and
was
gone
a
black
and
white
beast
stood
where
the
man
had
been
its
tufted
tail
lashing
its
muzzle
a
mask
of
snarling
hate
and
blood
lust
but
tau
met
that
transformation
with
laughter
which
was
like
the
lash
of
a
whip
we
both
be
men
you
and
i
lumbrilo
meet
me
as
a
man
and
keep
those
trickeries
for
those
who
have
not
the
clear
sight
a
child
plays
as
a
child
so
tau
voice
came
in
a
rumble
but
tau
was
gone
the
huge
hairy
thing
which
swayed
in
his
place
turned
a
gorilla
beast
visage
to
his
enemy
for
a
breathless
moment
terran
ape
confronted
khatkan
lion
then
the
spaceman
was
himself
again
the
time
for
games
is
over
man
of
khatka
you
have
tried
to
hunt
us
to
our
deaths
have
you
not
therefore
death
shall
be
the
portion
of
the
loser
now
lion
vanished
man
stood
watching
alertly
as
swordsman
might
face
swordsman
with
a
blood
feud
lying
on
their
blades
to
dane
eyes
the
khatkan
made
no
move
yet
the
fire
leaped
high
as
if
freshly
fed
and
flames
burst
from
the
wood
flew
into
the
air
red
and
perilous
birds
darting
at
tau
until
they
outlined
him
from
the
ground
under
his
boots
to
an
arch
over
his
head
they
united
and
spun
faster
until
dane
watching
with
dazzled
eyes
saw
the
wheel
become
a
blur
of
light
hiding
tau
within
its
fiery
core
his
own
wrists
ached
with
the
strain
of
his
drumming
as
he
lifted
one
hand
and
tried
to
shield
his
sight
from
the
glare
of
that
pillar
of
fire
lumbrilo
was
chanting
a
heavy
blast
of
words
dane
stiffened
his
traitorous
hands
were
falling
into
the
rhythm
of
that
other
song
straightaway
he
raised
both
from
the
drum
head
brought
them
down
in
a
discordinate
series
of
thumps
which
bore
no
relation
to
either
the
song
tau
wanted
or
that
which
lumbrilo
was
now
crooning
thump
dane
beat
it
out
frantically
belaboring
the
drum
head
as
he
wanted
to
sink
his
fists
home
on
the
body
of
the
khatkan
witch
doctor
the
pillar
of
fire
swayed
fluttered
as
if
a
wind
drove
it
and
was
gone
tau
unmarked
smiled
fire
he
pointed
his
fingers
at
lumbrilo
would
you
try
earth
and
water
and
air
also
wizard
call
hither
your
whirlwind
up
your
flood
summon
the
land
to
quake
none
of
those
shall
bring
me
down
shapes
came
flooding
out
of
the
night
some
monstrous
some
human
streaming
past
lumbrilo
to
crowd
into
the
circle
of
firelight
some
dane
thought
he
knew
some
were
strangers
men
wearing
space
uniforms
or
the
dress
of
other
worlds
women
they
strode
wept
mingled
with
the
monsters
to
laugh
curse
threaten
dane
guessed
that
lumbrilo
sent
now
against
the
terran
the
harvest
of
the
medic
own
memories
he
shut
his
eyes
against
this
enforced
intrusion
upon
another
past
but
not
before
he
saw
tau
face
strained
fined
to
the
bones
beneath
the
thin
flesh
holding
still
a
twisted
smile
as
he
met
each
memory
accepted
the
pain
it
held
for
him
and
set
it
aside
unshaken
this
too
has
no
power
any
longer
man
who
walks
in
the
dark
dane
opened
his
eyes
those
crowding
wraiths
were
fading
losing
substance
lumbrilo
crouched
his
lips
drawn
back
from
his
teeth
his
hatred
plain
to
read
i
am
not
clay
to
be
molded
by
your
hands
lumbrilo
and
now
i
say
that
the
time
has
come
to
call
an
end
tau
raised
his
hands
slowly
once
again
holding
them
away
from
his
body
palms
pointing
earthward
and
beneath
them
on
either
side
of
the
spaceman
two
black
shadows
gathered
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
you
have
fettered
yourself
with
your
own
bounds
as
you
have
been
the
hunter
so
shall
you
now
be
the
hunted
those
shadows
were
growing
as
plants
might
issue
from
the
packed
soil
of
the
camping
ground
when
his
hands
were
shoulder
high
tau
held
them
steady
now
on
either
side
of
his
tautly
held
body
crouched
one
of
the
lions
with
which
lumbrilo
had
identified
his
own
brand
of
magic
throughout
the
year
lumbrilo
lion
had
been
larger
than
life
more
intelligent
more
dangerous
subtly
different
from
the
normal
animal
it
counterfeited
so
now
were
these
and
both
of
them
raised
their
heads
to
gaze
intently
into
the
medic
face
hunt
well
brothers
in
fur
he
said
slowly
almost
caressingly
him
whom
you
hunt
shall
grant
you
sport
in
the
going
stop
it
a
man
leaped
from
the
shadows
behind
the
witch
doctor
firelight
made
plain
his
dress
and
he
swung
up
a
blaster
aiming
at
the
nearest
of
the
waiting
beasts
that
flash
struck
true
but
it
neither
killed
nor
even
singed
the
fine
fur
of
the
animal
pelt
as
the
blaster
aim
was
swung
from
beast
to
man
dane
fired
first
his
ray
brought
a
scream
from
the
other
who
dropped
his
weapon
from
a
badly
seared
hand
to
reel
back
cursing
tau
waved
his
hands
gently
the
great
animal
heads
turned
obediently
until
the
red
eyes
were
set
on
lumbrilo
facing
them
the
witch
doctor
straightened
spat
out
his
hate
at
the
medic
i
do
not
run
to
be
hunted
devil
man
i
think
you
do
lumbrilo
for
you
must
taste
fear
now
as
you
have
made
other
men
drink
of
it
so
that
it
fills
your
blood
and
races
through
your
body
clouds
your
mind
to
make
of
you
less
than
a
man
you
have
hunted
out
those
who
doubted
your
power
who
stood
in
your
chosen
path
whom
you
wanted
removed
from
the
earth
of
khatka
do
you
doubt
that
they
wait
in
the
last
dark
for
you
now
ready
to
greet
you
witch
doctor
what
they
have
known
you
shall
also
know
this
night
you
have
shown
me
all
that
lies
in
my
past
that
is
weak
that
was
evil
that
i
may
regret
or
find
sorrow
for
so
shall
you
also
remember
through
the
few
hours
left
you
aye
you
run
lumbrilo
as
he
spoke
tau
approached
the
other
the
two
hunters
pacing
beside
him
now
he
stooped
and
caught
up
a
pinch
of
soil
and
spat
upon
it
three
times
then
he
threw
the
tiny
clod
of
earth
at
the
witch
doctor
it
struck
lumbrilo
just
above
the
heart
and
the
man
reeled
under
what
might
have
been
a
murderous
blow
the
khatkan
broke
then
completely
with
a
wailing
cry
he
whirled
and
ran
crashing
into
the
brush
as
one
who
runs
blindly
and
without
hope
behind
him
the
two
beasts
leaped
noiselessly
together
and
all
three
were
gone
tau
swayed
put
his
hand
to
his
head
dane
kicked
away
the
drum
arose
from
his
cramped
position
stiffly
to
go
to
him
but
the
medic
was
not
yet
done
he
returned
to
stand
over
the
prostrate
native
hunters
and
he
clapped
his
hands
sharply
you
are
men
and
you
shall
act
as
men
henceforth
that
which
was
is
no
longer
stand
free
for
the
dark
power
follows
him
who
misused
it
and
fear
no
longer
eats
from
your
basins
drinks
from
your
cups
or
lies
beside
you
on
the
sleep
mats
tau
jellico
shout
reached
them
over
the
cries
of
the
rousing
khatkans
but
dane
was
there
first
catching
the
medic
before
he
slumped
to
the
ground
but
he
was
dragged
with
that
dead
weight
until
he
sat
with
the
medic
head
on
his
shoulder
the
other
body
resting
heavily
against
him
for
one
moment
dane
feared
that
he
did
indeed
hold
a
dead
man
that
one
of
the
outlaw
hunters
must
have
struck
a
last
blow
for
his
discredited
leader
then
tau
sighed
and
began
to
breathe
deeply
dane
glanced
up
amazed
at
the
captain
he
asleep
jellico
knelt
and
his
hand
went
to
test
heart
beat
then
to
touch
the
medic
worn
and
dirty
face
best
thing
for
him
he
said
briskly
he
had
it
it
took
some
time
to
get
the
facts
of
their
triumph
sorted
out
two
of
the
poachers
were
dead
the
other
and
the
spaceman
were
prisoners
while
nymani
rounded
up
in
addition
the
man
dane
had
burned
to
save
tau
when
the
younger
spaceman
returned
from
making
the
medic
comfortable
in
the
shelter
he
found
asaki
and
jellico
holding
an
impromptu
court
of
inquiry
the
dazed
native
hunters
had
been
expertly
looped
together
by
nymani
and
a
little
apart
from
them
the
were
under
examination
an
man
eh
jellico
smoothing
a
chin
with
a
grimed
hand
regarded
the
latest
arrival
measuringly
trying
to
run
in
and
break
a
combine
charter
were
you
you
better
spill
the
facts
your
own
head
office
will
disown
you
you
ought
to
know
that
they
never
back
any
failures
in
these
undercover
deals
i
want
medical
attention
snapped
the
other
cradling
his
seared
hand
to
his
chest
or
do
you
plan
to
turn
me
over
to
these
savages
seeing
as
how
you
tried
to
blast
our
medic
replied
the
captain
with
a
grin
which
was
close
to
he
may
not
feel
much
like
patching
up
those
fingers
of
yours
stick
in
where
they
have
no
business
and
they
apt
to
get
burned
at
any
rate
he
not
going
to
look
at
until
he
had
a
chance
to
rest
i
give
you
first
aid
and
while
working
we
talk
going
into
the
poaching
trade
now
that
news
is
going
to
please
combine
they
have
no
use
for
you
boys
anyway
his
answer
was
lurid
and
uninformative
but
the
uniform
tunic
the
other
wore
could
not
be
so
easily
explained
away
dane
worn
out
stretched
his
aching
length
on
a
pile
of
mats
and
lost
all
interest
in
the
argument
two
days
later
they
stood
once
more
on
the
same
terrace
where
lumbrilo
had
wrought
his
magic
and
met
his
first
defeat
this
time
no
lightning
played
along
the
mountain
ridges
and
the
blaze
of
the
sun
was
so
bright
and
clear
that
one
could
hardly
believe
in
the
fantastic
happenings
of
that
swamp
clearing
where
men
had
fought
with
weapons
not
made
by
hands
the
three
from
the
moved
away
from
the
parapet
to
meet
the
chief
ranger
as
he
came
down
the
stairs
a
messenger
has
just
arrived
the
hunter
was
hunted
indeed
and
his
going
was
witnessed
by
many
though
they
did
not
see
those
which
hunted
him
lumbrilo
is
dead
he
came
to
his
end
by
the
great
river
jellico
started
but
that
is
almost
fifty
miles
from
the
swamp
on
this
side
of
the
mountain
he
was
hunted
and
he
fled
as
you
promised
asaki
said
to
tau
you
made
strong
magic
man
the
medic
shook
his
head
slowly
i
but
turned
his
own
methods
against
him
because
he
believed
in
his
power
that
same
power
reflected
back
broke
him
had
i
been
facing
one
who
did
not
believe
he
shrugged
our
first
meeting
set
the
pattern
from
that
moment
he
feared
a
little
that
i
could
match
him
and
his
uncertainty
pierced
a
hole
in
his
armor
why
on
earth
did
you
want
bound
burst
out
dane
still
seeking
an
explanation
for
that
one
small
mystery
among
the
others
tau
chuckled
in
the
first
place
that
blasted
tune
has
haunted
us
all
for
so
long
that
i
knew
its
rhythm
was
probably
the
one
you
could
keep
to
without
hardly
knowing
that
you
were
beating
it
out
and
in
the
second
place
its
alien
pattern
was
a
part
of
our
particular
background
to
counteract
lumbrilo
native
khatkan
music
which
was
certainly
a
big
factor
in
stage
setting
he
must
have
believed
that
we
would
not
find
out
about
the
drugged
water
and
so
would
be
prepared
for
any
fantasy
he
cared
to
produce
when
they
saw
us
coming
out
over
the
swamp
they
counted
us
easy
takings
his
practice
had
always
been
with
khatkans
and
he
judged
us
by
their
reactions
to
stimuli
he
knew
well
how
to
use
so
he
failed
asaki
smiled
which
was
good
for
khatka
but
ill
for
lumbrilo
and
those
using
him
to
make
mischief
here
the
poacher
and
the
outlaw
hunters
will
meet
with
our
justice
which
i
do
not
believe
they
will
relish
but
the
other
two
the
spaceman
and
the
company
agent
are
to
be
sent
to
xecho
to
face
combine
authorities
it
is
my
thought
that
those
will
not
accept
kindly
the
meddling
of
another
company
in
their
territory
jellico
grunted
kindness
and
combine
are
widely
separated
in
such
matters
but
we
can
now
take
passage
on
the
same
ship
as
your
prisoners
but
my
friend
you

not
yet
seen

you
that

give
me
greater
pleasure
than
to

the

and
his

was
echoed
from

very
