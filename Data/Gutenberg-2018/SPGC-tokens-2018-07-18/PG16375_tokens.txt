overfield
court
lay
basking
in
warm
june
sunshine
the
western
side
of
the
great
house
with
its
new
timber
and
plaster
faced
the
evening
sun
across
the
square
lawns
and
high
terrace
and
the
woods
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
away
cast
long
shadows
over
the
gardens
that
lay
beyond
the
moat
the
lawns
in
their
broad
plateaux
on
the
eastern
side
descended
by
steps
in
cool
shadow
to
the
lake
that
formed
a
below
the
angle
of
the
house
and
the
mirrored
trees
and
reeds
on
the
other
side
were
broken
circle
after
circle
by
the
great
trout
that
were
rising
for
their
evening
meal
the
tall
front
of
the
house
on
the
north
formed
by
the
hall
in
the
centre
with
the
kitchen
at
its
eastern
end
and
the
master
chamber
on
the
western
was
faced
by
a
gatehouse
through
which
the
straight
drive
leading
into
the
main
road
approached
the
house
under
a
and
on
the
south
side
the
ground
fell
away
again
rapidly
below
the
chapel
and
the
in
copse
and
garden
and
wild
meadow
bright
with
buttercups
and
daisies
down
to
the
lake
again
and
the
moat
that
ran
out
of
it
round
the
entire
domain
the
cobbled
courtyard
in
the
centre
of
the
house
where
the
tall
leaded
pump
stood
was
full
of
movement
half
a
dozen
trunks
lay
there
that
had
just
been
carried
in
from
the
that
were
now
being
led
away
with
patient
hanging
heads
towards
the
stables
that
stood
outside
the
gatehouse
on
the
right
and
three
or
four
dusty
men
in
livery
were
talking
to
the
who
had
come
out
of
their
quarters
on
the
left
from
the
kitchen
corner
came
a
clamour
of
tongues
and
dishes
and
smoke
was
rising
steadily
from
the
huge
outside
chimney
that
rose
beyond
the
roofs
presently
there
came
clear
and
distinct
from
the
direction
of
the
village
the
throb
of
hoofs
on
the
hard
road
and
the
men
shouldered
the
trunks
and
disappeared
staggering
under
the
low
archway
on
the
right
beside
which
the
lamp
extinguisher
hung
grimy
with
smoke
and
grease
the
yard
dog
came
out
at
the
sound
of
the
hoofs
dragging
his
chain
after
him
from
his
kennel
beneath
the
little
cloister
outside
the
chapel
barked
solemnly
once
or
twice
and
having
done
his
duty
lay
down
on
the
cool
stones
head
on
paws
watching
with
bright
eyes
the
door
that
led
from
the
hall
into
the
court
a
moment
later
the
little
door
from
the
masters
chamber
opened
and
sir
james
torridon
came
out
and
giving
a
glance
at
the
disappearing
servants
said
a
word
or
two
to
the
others
and
turned
again
through
the
hall
to
meet
his
sons
the
coach
was
coming
up
the
drive
round
toward
the
gatehouse
as
he
came
out
on
the
wide
paved
terrace
and
he
stood
watching
the
glitter
of
brasswork
through
the
dust
the
four
plumed
cantering
horses
in
front
and
the
bobbing
heads
of
the
men
that
rode
behind
and
there
was
a
grave
pleased
expectancy
on
his
bearded
face
and
in
his
bright
grey
eyes
as
he
looked
his
two
sons
had
met
at
begham
and
were
coming
home
ralph
from
town
sites
a
six
months
absence
and
christopher
from
canterbury
where
he
had
been
spending
a
week
or
two
in
company
with
carleton
the
chaplain
of
the
court
he
was
the
more
pleased
as
the
house
had
been
rather
lonely
in
their
absence
since
the
two
daughters
were
both
from
home
mary
with
her
husband
sir
nicholas
maxwell
over
at
great
keynes
and
margaret
at
her
convent
education
at
rusper
and
he
himself
had
had
for
company
his
wife
alone
she
came
out
presently
as
the
carriage
rolled
through
the
archway
a
tall
dignified
figure
of
a
woman
finely
dressed
in
purple
and
black
and
stood
by
him
silently
a
yard
or
two
away
watching
the
carriage
out
of
steady
black
eyes
a
moment
later
the
carriage
drew
up
at
the
steps
and
a
couple
of
servants
ran
down
to
open
the
door
ralph
stepped
out
first
a
tall
man
like
both
his
parents
with
a
face
and
slow
gait
extraordinarily
like
his
mother
and
dressed
in
the
same
kind
of
rich
splendour
with
a
short
travelling
cloak
crimson
hose
and
plumed
felt
cap
and
his
face
with
its
pointed
black
beard
had
something
of
the
same
steady
impassivity
in
it
he
was
flicking
the
dust
from
his
shoulder
as
he
came
up
the
steps
on
to
the
terrace
christopher
followed
him
not
quite
so
tall
as
the
other
and
a
good
ten
years
younger
with
the
grey
eyes
of
his
father
and
a
little
brown
beard
beginning
to
sprout
on
his
cheeks
and
chin
ralph
turned
at
the
top
of
the
steps
the
bag
he
said
shortly
and
then
turned
again
to
kiss
his
hands
as
christopher
went
back
to
the
carriage
from
which
the
priest
was
just
stepping
out
sir
james
asked
his
son
about
the
journey
oh
yes
he
said
and
then
added
christopher
was
late
at
begham
and
you
are
well
my
son
asked
his
mother
as
they
turned
to
walk
up
to
the
house
oh
yes
he
said
again
sir
james
waited
for
christopher
and
carleton
and
the
three
followed
the
others
a
few
yards
behind
you
saw
her
said
his
father
christopher
nodded
yes
he
said
i
must
speak
to
you
sir
before
i
tell
the
others
come
to
me
when
you
are
dressed
then
supper
will
be
in
an
hour
from
now
and
he
looked
at
his
son
with
a
kind
of
sharp
expectancy
the
courtyard
was
empty
as
they
passed
through
but
half
a
dozen
servants
stood
crowded
in
the
little
flagged
passage
that
led
from
it
into
the
kitchen
and
watched
ralph
and
his
mother
with
an
awed
interest
as
they
came
out
from
the
hall
ralph
had
come
down
from
the
heart
of
life
as
they
knew
had
been
present
at
the
crowning
of
anne
boleyn
a
week
before
had
mixed
with
great
folks
and
what
secrets
of
state
might
there
not
be
in
that
little
strapped
bag
that
his
brother
carried
behind
him
when
the
two
first
had
disappeared
the
servants
broke
into
talk
and
went
back
to
the
kitchen
lady
torridon
with
her
elder
son
and
the
chaplain
had
to
wait
a
few
minutes
on
the
dais
in
the
hall
an
hour
later
before
the
door
under
the
musicians
gallery
opened
and
the
other
two
came
in
from
the
chamber
sir
james
looked
a
little
anxious
as
he
came
across
the
clean
strewed
rushes
past
the
table
at
the
lower
end
where
the
household
sat
but
christopher
face
was
bright
with
excitement
after
a
word
or
two
of
apology
they
moved
to
their
places
carleton
said
grace
and
as
they
sat
down
the
door
behind
from
the
kitchen
opened
and
the
servants
came
through
with
the
pewter
dishes
ralph
was
very
silent
at
first
his
mother
sat
by
him
almost
as
silent
as
himself
the
servants
sprang
about
noiseless
and
eager
to
wait
on
him
and
sir
james
and
the
chaplain
did
most
of
the
conversation
pleasant
harmless
talk
about
the
estate
and
the
tenants
but
as
supper
went
on
and
the
weariness
of
the
hot
journey
faded
and
the
talk
from
the
lower
tables
grew
louder
ralph
began
to
talk
a
little
more
freely
yes
he
said
the
crowning
went
well
enough
the
people
were
quiet
enough
she
looked
very
pretty
in
her
robes
she
was
in
purple
velvet
and
her
gentlemen
in
scarlet
we
shall
have
news
of
her
soon
sir
james
looked
up
sharply
at
his
son
they
were
all
listening
intently
and
even
a
servant
behind
ralph
chair
paused
with
a
silver
jug
yes
said
ralph
again
with
a
tranquil
air
setting
down
his
venetian
glass
god
has
blessed
the
union
already
and
the
king
asked
his
father
from
his
black
velvet
chair
in
the
centre
there
fell
a
deeper
silence
yet
as
that
name
was
mentioned
henry
dominated
the
imagination
of
his
subjects
to
an
extraordinary
degree
no
less
in
his
heavy
than
in
the
magnificent
strength
and
capacity
of
his
youth
but
ralph
answered
carelessly
enough
he
had
seen
the
king
too
often
the
king
looked
pleased
enough
he
was
in
his
throne
he
is
stouter
than
when
i
saw
him
last
my
lord
of
canterbury
did
the
crowning
te
deum
was
sung
after
and
then
solemn
mass
there
was
a
dozen
abbots
i
should
think
and
my
lords
of
york
and
london
and
winchester
with
two
or
three
more
my
lord
of
suffolk
bore
the
crown
and
the
procession
asked
his
father
again
that
too
was
well
enough
there
came
four
chariots
after
the
queen
full
of
ancient
old
ladies
at
which
some
of
the
folks
laughed
and
then
the
rest
of
them
they
talked
a
few
minutes
about
the
coronation
sir
james
asking
most
of
the
questions
and
ralph
answering
shortly
and
presently
christopher
broke
in
and
the
lady
katharine
he
began
hush
my
son
said
his
father
glancing
at
ralph
who
sat
perfectly
still
a
moment
before
answering
chris
is
always
eager
about
the
wrong
thing
he
said
evenly
he
is
late
at
begham
and
then
asks
me
about
the
princess
dowager
she
is
still
alive
if
you
mean
that
lady
torridon
looked
from
one
to
the
other
and
master
cromwell
she
asked
master
cromwell
is
well
enough
he
asked
me
to
give
you
both
his
respects
i
left
him
at
hackney
the
tall
southern
windows
of
the
hall
above
the
pargetted
plaster
had
faded
through
glowing
ruby
and
blue
to
dusk
before
they
rose
from
the
table
and
went
down
and
through
the
passage
into
the
little
parlour
next
the
master
chamber
where
they
usually
took
their
dessert
this
part
of
the
house
had
been
lately
but
the
old
woodwork
had
been
and
the
pale
oak
panels
each
crowned
by
an
elaborate
foliated
head
gave
back
the
pleasant
flicker
of
the
fire
that
burned
between
the
polished
sheets
of
flemish
tiles
on
either
side
of
the
hearth
a
great
globe
stood
in
the
corner
furthest
from
the
door
with
a
map
of
england
hanging
above
it
a
piece
of
tapestry
hung
over
the
mantelpiece
representing
diana
bending
over
endymion
and
two
tall
candles
in
brass
stands
burned
beneath
the
floor
was
covered
with
rushes
carleton
who
had
come
with
them
as
far
as
the
door
according
to
custom
was
on
the
point
of
when
sir
james
called
him
back
come
in
father
he
said
we
want
you
chris
has
something
to
tell
us
the
priest
came
in
and
sat
down
with
the
others
his
face
in
shadow
at
the
corner
of
the
hearth
sir
james
looked
across
at
his
younger
son
and
nodded
and
chris
his
chin
on
his
hand
and
sitting
very
upright
on
the
settle
beside
the
chaplain
began
rather
nervously
and
abruptly
i
i
have
told
ralph
he
said
on
the
way
here
and
you
sir
but
i
will
tell
you
again
you
know
i
was
questioning
whether
i
had
a
vocation
to
the
religious
life
and
i
went
with
that
in
my
mind
to
see
the
holy
maid
we
saw
her
carleton
and
i
and
and
i
have
made
up
my
mind
i
must
go
he
stopped
hesitating
a
little
ralph
and
his
mother
sat
perfectly
still
without
a
word
or
sign
of
either
sympathy
or
disapproval
his
father
leaned
forward
a
little
and
smiled
encouragingly
go
on
my
son
chris
drew
a
breath
and
leaned
back
more
easily
well
we
went
to
sepulchre
and
she
could
not
see
us
for
a
day
or
two
there
were
several
others
staying
with
us
at
the
monastery
there
was
a
carthusian
from
sheen
i
forget
his
name
henry
man
put
in
the
and
some
others
went
on
chris
all
waiting
to
see
her
bocking
promised
to
tell
us
when
we
could
see
her
and
he
came
to
us
one
morning
after
mass
and
told
us
that
she
was
in
ecstasy
and
that
we
were
to
come
at
once
so
we
all
went
to
the
nuns
chapel
and
there
she
was
on
her
knees
with
her
arms
across
her
breast
he
stopped
again
ralph
cleared
his
throat
crossed
his
legs
and
drank
a
little
wine
yes
said
the
knight
questioningly
well
she
said
a
great
deal
went
on
chris
hurriedly
about
the
king
put
in
his
mother
who
was
looking
at
the
fire
a
little
about
the
king
said
chris
and
about
holy
things
as
well
she
spoke
about
heaven
it
was
wonderful
to
hear
her
with
her
eyes
burning
and
such
a
voice
and
then
she
spoke
low
and
deep
and
told
us
about
hell
and
the
devil
and
his
torments
and
i
could
hardly
bear
to
listen
and
she
told
us
about
shrift
and
what
it
did
for
the
soul
and
the
blessed
sacrament
the
carthusian
put
a
question
or
two
to
her
and
she
answered
them
and
all
the
while
she
was
speaking
her
voice
seemed
to
come
from
her
body
and
not
from
her
mouth
and
it
was
terrible
to
see
her
when
she
spoke
of
hell
her
tongue
lay
out
on
her
cheek
and
her
eyes
grew
little
and
afraid
her
tongue
in
her
cheek
did
you
say
asked
ralph
politely
without
moving
chris
flushed
and
sat
back
silent
his
father
glanced
quickly
from
one
to
the
other
tell
us
more
chris
he
said
what
did
she
say
to
you
the
young
man
leaned
forward
again
i
wish
ralph
he
began
i
was
asking
began
the
other
there
there
said
sir
james
go
on
chris
well
after
a
while
bocking
brought
me
forward
and
told
her
to
look
at
me
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
see
something
beyond
me
and
i
was
afraid
but
he
told
me
to
ask
her
and
i
did
she
said
nothing
for
a
while
and
then
she
began
to
speak
of
a
great
church
as
if
she
saw
it
and
she
saw
there
was
a
tower
in
the
middle
and
chapels
on
either
side
and
tombs
beside
the
high
altar
and
an
image
and
then
she
stopped
and
cried
out
aloud
pancras
pray
for
us
and
then
i
knew
chris
was
trembling
violently
with
excitement
as
he
turned
to
the
priest
for
corroboration
carleton
nodded
once
or
twice
without
speaking
then
i
knew
went
on
chris
you
know
it
was
what
i
had
in
my
mind
and
i
had
not
spoken
a
word
of
lewes
or
of
my
thought
of
going
there
had
you
told
any
asked
his
father
only
bocking
then
i
asked
her
was
i
to
go
there
but
she
said
nothing
for
a
while
and
her
eyes
wandered
about
and
she
began
to
speak
of
black
monks
going
this
way
and
that
and
she
spoke
of
a
prior
and
of
his
ring
it
was
of
gold
she
said
with
figures
engraved
on
it
you
know
the
ring
the
prior
wears
he
added
looking
eagerly
at
his
father
sir
james
nodded
i
know
it
he
said
well
well
i
asked
her
again
was
i
to
go
there
and
then
she
looked
at
me
up
and
down
i
was
in
my
travelling
suit
but
she
said
she
saw
my
cowl
and
its
hanging
sleeves
and
an
antiphoner
in
my
hands
and
then
her
face
grew
dreadful
and
afraid
again
and
she
cried
out
and
fell
forward
and
bocking
led
us
out
from
the
chapel
there
was
a
long
silence
as
chris
ended
and
leaned
back
again
taking
up
a
bunch
of
raisins
ralph
sighed
once
as
if
wearied
out
and
his
mother
put
her
hand
on
his
sleeve
then
at
last
sir
james
spoke
you
have
heard
the
story
he
said
and
then
paused
but
there
was
no
answer
at
last
the
chaplain
spoke
from
his
place
it
is
all
as
chris
said
he
began
i
was
there
and
heard
it
if
the
woman
is
not
from
god
she
is
one
of
satan
own
and
it
is
hard
to
think
that
satan
would
tell
us
of
the
sacraments
and
bid
us
use
them
greedily
and
if
she
is
from
god
he
stopped
again
the
knight
nodded
at
him
and
you
sweetheart
he
said
to
his
wife
she
turned
to
him
slowly
you
know
what
i
think
she
said
if
chris
believes
it
he
must
go
i
suppose
and
you
ralph
ralph
raised
himself
in
his
chair
do
you
wish
me
to
say
what
i
think
he
asked
deliberately
or
what
chris
wishes
me
to
say
i
will
do
either
chris
made
a
quick
movement
of
his
head
but
his
father
answered
for
him
we
wish
you
to
say
what
you
think
he
said
quietly
well
then
said
ralph
it
is
this
i
can
not
agree
with
the
father
i
think
the
woman
is
neither
of
god
nor
satan
but
that
she
speaks
of
her
own
heart
and
of
bocking
i
believe
they
are
a
couple
of
knaves
clever
knaves
i
will
grant
though
perhaps
the
woman
is
something
of
a
fool
too
for
she
deceives
persons
as
wise
even
as
carleton
here
by
speaking
of
shrift
and
the
like
and
so
she
does
the
priests
will
and
hopes
to
get
gain
for
them
and
herself
i
am
not
alone
in
thinking
this
there
are
many
in
town
who
think
with
me
and
holy
persons
too
is
master
cromwell
one
of
them
put
in
chris
bitterly
ralph
raised
his
eyebrows
a
little
there
is
no
use
in
sneering
he
said
but
master
cromwell
is
one
of
them
i
suppose
i
ought
not
to
speak
of
this
but
i
know
you
will
not
speak
of
it
again
and
i
can
tell
you
of
my
own
knowledge
that
the
holy
maid
will
not
be
at
sepulchre
much
longer
his
father
leaned
forward
do
you
mean
he
began
i
mean
that
his
grace
is
weary
of
her
prophesyings
it
was
all
very
well
till
she
began
to
meddle
with
matters
of
state
but
his
grace
will
have
none
of
that
i
can
tell
you
no
more
on
the
other
hand
if
chris
thinks
he
must
be
a
monk
well
and
good
i
do
not
think
so
myself
but
that
is
not
my
affair
but
i
hope
he
will
not
be
a
monk
only
because
a
knavish
woman
has
put
out
her
tongue
at
him
and
repeated
what
a
knavish
priest
has
put
into
her
mouth
but
i
suppose
he
had
made
up
his
mind
before
he
asked
me
he
has
made
up
his
mind
said
his
father
and
will
hold
to
it
unless
reason
is
shown
to
the
contrary
and
for
myself
i
think
he
is
right
very
well
then
said
ralph
and
leaned
back
once
more
the
minutes
passed
away
in
silence
for
a
while
and
then
ralph
asked
a
question
or
two
about
his
sisters
mary
is
coming
over
to
hunt
with
her
husband
said
sir
james
i
have
told
forrest
to
be
here
by
nine
shall
you
come
with
us
ralph
yawned
and
sipped
his
bordeaux
i
do
not
know
he
said
i
suppose
so
and
margaret
is
at
rusper
still
went
on
the
other
she
will
not
be
here
until
august
she
too
is
thinking
of
religion
put
in
lady
torridon
impassively
ralph
looked
up
lazily
indeed
he
said
then
mary
and
i
will
be
the
only
worldlings
she
is
very
happy
with
the
nuns
said
his
father
smiling
and
a
worldling
can
be
no
more
than
that
and
perhaps
not
always
as
much
ralph
smiled
with
one
corner
of
his
mouth
you
are
quite
right
sir
he
said
the
bell
for
evening
prayers
sounded
out
presently
from
the
turret
in
the
and
the
chaplain
rose
and
went
out
will
you
forgive
me
sir
said
ralph
if
i
do
not
come
this
evening
i
am
worn
out
with
travelling
the
stay
at
begham
was
very
troublesome
then
my
son
i
will
send
morris
to
you
immediately
oh
after
prayers
said
ralph
i
need
not
deprive
god
of
his
prayers
too
lady
torridon
had
gone
out
silently
after
the
chaplain
and
sir
james
and
chris
walked
across
the
court
together
overhead
the
summer
night
sky
was
clear
and
luminous
with
stars
and
the
air
still
and
fragrant
there
were
a
few
lights
here
and
there
round
the
court
and
the
tall
chapel
windows
shone
dimly
above
the
little
cloister
a
link
flared
steadily
on
its
iron
bracket
by
the
door
into
the
hall
and
threw
waves
of
flickering
ruddy
light
across
the
and
the
shadow
of
the
tall
pump
wavered
on
the
further
side
sir
james
put
his
hand
tenderly
on
chris
shoulder
you
must
not
be
angry
at
ralph
my
son
he
said
remember
he
does
not
understand
he
should
not
speak
like
that
said
chris
fiercely
how
dare
he
do
so
of
course
he
should
not
but
he
does
not
know
that
he
thinks
he
is
advising
you
well
you
must
let
him
alone
chris
you
must
remember
he
is
almost
mad
with
business
master
cromwell
works
him
hard
the
chapel
was
but
dimly
lighted
as
chris
made
his
way
up
to
the
high
gallery
at
the
west
where
he
usually
knelt
the
altar
glimmered
in
the
dusk
at
the
further
end
and
only
a
couple
of
candles
burned
on
the
priest
kneeling
stool
on
the
south
side
the
rest
was
dark
for
the
house
hold
knew
compline
by
heart
and
even
before
chris
reached
his
seat
he
heard
the
blessing
asked
for
a
quiet
night
and
a
perfect
end
it
was
very
soothing
to
him
as
he
leaned
over
the
oak
rail
and
looked
down
on
the
dim
figures
of
his
parents
in
their
seat
at
the
front
and
the
heads
of
the
servants
below
and
listened
to
the
quiet
pulsation
of
those
waves
of
prayer
going
to
and
fro
in
the
dusk
beating
as
a
summer
tide
at
the
foot
of
a
cliff
against
those
white
steps
that
rose
up
to
the
altar
where
a
single
spark
winked
against
the
leaded
window
beneath
the
pyx
he
had
come
home
full
of
excitement
and
joy
at
his
first
sight
of
an
ecstatic
and
at
the
message
that
she
had
seemed
to
have
for
him
and
across
these
heightened
perceptions
had
jarred
the
impatience
of
his
brother
in
the
inn
at
begham
and
in
the
carriage
on
their
way
home
and
above
all
his
sharp
criticism
and
aloofness
in
the
parlour
just
now
but
he
became
quieter
as
he
knelt
now
the
bitterness
seemed
to
sink
beneath
him
and
to
leave
him
alone
in
a
world
of
peaceful
glory
the
world
of
mystic
life
to
which
his
face
was
now
set
illuminated
by
the
words
of
the
nun
he
had
seen
one
who
could
see
further
than
he
himself
he
had
looked
upon
eyes
that
were
fixed
on
mysteries
and
realms
in
which
he
indeed
passionately
believed
but
which
were
apt
to
be
faint
and
formless
sometimes
to
the
weary
eyes
of
faith
alone
and
as
a
proof
that
these
were
more
than
fancies
she
had
told
him
too
of
what
he
could
verify
of
the
priory
at
lewes
which
she
had
never
visited
and
even
the
details
of
the
ring
on
the
prior
finger
which
he
alone
of
the
two
had
seen
and
then
lastly
she
had
encouraged
him
in
his
desires
had
seen
him
with
those
same
wide
eyes
in
the
habit
that
he
longed
to
wear
going
about
the
psalmody
the
great
to
which
he
longed
to
consecrate
his
life
if
such
were
not
a
message
from
god
to
him
for
what
further
revelation
could
he
hope
and
as
for
ralph
news
and
interests
of
what
value
were
they
of
what
importance
was
it
to
ask
who
sat
on
the
consort
throne
or
whether
she
wore
purple
velvet
or
red
these
were
little
matters
compared
with
those
high
affairs
of
the
soul
and
the
eternal
god
of
which
he
was
already
beginning
to
catch
glimpses
and
even
the
whispers
that
ran
about
the
country
places
and
of
which
ralph
no
doubt
could
tell
him
much
if
he
chose
of
the
danger
that
threatened
the
religious
houses
and
of
henry
intentions
towards
them
even
these
were
but
impotent
cries
of
the
people
raging
round
the
throne
of
the
anointed
so
he
knelt
here
now
pacified
and
content
again
and
thought
with
something
of
pity
of
his
brother
dozing
now
no
doubt
before
the
parlour
fire
cramped
by
his
poor
ideals
and
dismally
happy
in
his
limitations
his
father
too
was
content
down
below
in
the
chapel
he
himself
had
at
one
time
before
his
marriage
looked
towards
the
religious
life
and
now
that
it
had
turned
out
otherwise
had
desired
nothing
more
than
that
he
should
be
represented
in
that
inner
world
of
god
favourites
by
at
least
one
of
his
children
his
daughter
margaret
had
written
a
week
earlier
to
say
that
her
mind
was
turning
that
way
and
now
decision
had
filled
up
the
cup
of
his
desires
to
have
a
priest
for
a
son
and
above
all
one
who
was
a
monk
as
well
was
more
than
he
had
dared
to
hope
though
not
to
pray
for
if
he
could
not
be
one
himself
at
least
he
had
begotten
one
one
who
would
represent
him
before
god
bring
a
blessing
on
the
house
and
pray
and
offer
sacrifice
for
his
soul
until
his
time
should
be
run
out
and
he
see
god
face
to
face
and
ralph
would
represent
him
before
men
and
carry
on
the
line
and
hand
on
the
house
to
a
third
generation
ralph
at
whom
he
had
felt
so
sorely
puzzled
of
late
for
he
seemed
full
of
objects
and
ambitions
for
which
the
father
had
very
little
sympathy
and
to
have
lost
almost
entirely
that
delicate
relation
with
home
that
was
at
once
so
indefinable
and
so
real
but
he
comforted
himself
by
the
thought
that
his
elder
son
was
not
wholly
wasting
time
as
so
many
of
the
country
squires
were
doing
round
about
absorbed
in
work
that
a
brainless
yeoman
could
do
with
better
success
ralph
at
least
was
occupied
with
grave
matters
in
cromwell
service
and
the
king
and
entrusted
with
high
secrets
the
issue
of
which
both
temporal
and
eternal
it
was
hard
to
predict
and
no
doubt
the
knight
thought
in
time
he
would
come
back
and
pick
up
the
strands
he
had
dropped
for
when
a
man
had
wife
and
children
of
his
own
to
care
for
other
businesses
must
seem
secondary
and
questions
that
could
be
ignored
before
must
be
faced
then
but
he
thought
with
a
little
anxiety
of
his
wife
and
wondered
whether
his
elder
son
had
not
after
all
inherited
that
kind
of
dry
rot
of
the
soul
in
which
the
sap
and
vigour
disappear
little
by
little
leaving
the
shape
indeed
intact
but
not
the
powers
when
he
had
married
her
years
before
she
had
seemed
to
him
an
incarnate
mystery
of
whose
key
he
was
taking
possession
her
silence
had
seemed
pregnant
with
knowledge
and
her
words
precious
pieces
from
an
immeasurable
treasury
and
then
little
by
little
he
had
found
that
the
wide
treasury
was
empty
clean
indeed
and
capacious
but
no
more
and
above
all
with
no
promise
of
any
riches
as
yet
unperceived
those
great
black
eyes
that
high
forehead
those
stately
movements
meant
nothing
it
was
a
splendid
figure
with
no
soul
within
she
did
her
duty
admirably
she
said
her
prayers
she
entertained
her
guests
with
the
proper
conversation
she
could
be
trusted
to
behave
well
in
any
circumstances
that
called
for
tact
or
strength
and
that
was
all
but
ralph
would
not
be
like
that
he
was
intensely
devoted
to
his
work
and
from
all
accounts
able
in
its
performance
and
more
than
that
with
all
his
impassivity
he
was
capable
of
passion
for
his
employer
sir
thomas
cromwell
was
to
ralph
eyes
his
father
had
begun
to
see
something
almost
more
than
human
a
word
against
that
master
of
his
would
set
his
eyes
blazing
and
his
voice
trembling
and
this
showed
that
at
least
the
soul
was
not
more
than
sleeping
or
its
powers
more
than
misdirected
and
meanwhile
there
was
chris
and
at
the
thought
the
father
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
gallery
and
saw
the
faint
outline
of
his
son
brown
head
against
the
whitewash
chapter
ii
a
foretaste
of
peace
it
was
not
until
the
party
was
riding
home
the
next
day
that
sir
nicholas
maxwell
and
his
wife
were
informed
of
chris
decision
they
had
had
a
fair
day
sport
in
the
two
estates
that
marched
with
one
another
between
overfield
and
great
keynes
and
about
fifteen
stags
had
been
killed
as
well
as
a
quantity
of
smaller
game
ralph
had
ridden
out
after
the
party
had
left
and
had
found
sir
nicholas
at
the
close
of
the
afternoon
just
as
the
last
drive
was
about
to
take
place
and
had
stepped
into
his
shelter
to
watch
the
finish
it
was
a
still
hot
afternoon
and
the
air
over
the
open
space
between
the
copse
in
which
they
stood
and
the
dense
forest
eighty
yards
away
danced
in
the
heat
ralph
nodded
to
his
who
was
flushed
and
sunburnt
and
then
stood
behind
running
his
eyes
up
and
down
that
sturdy
figure
with
the
legs
set
well
apart
and
the
little
feathered
cap
that
moved
this
way
and
that
as
the
sportsman
peered
through
the
branches
before
him
once
he
turned
fierce
eyes
backwards
at
the
whine
of
one
of
the
hounds
and
then
again
thrust
his
hot
dripping
face
into
the
greenery
then
very
far
away
came
a
shout
and
a
chorus
of
taps
and
cries
followed
it
sounding
from
a
couple
of
miles
away
as
the
beaters
after
sweeping
a
wide
circle
entered
the
thick
undergrowth
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
wood
sir
nicholas
legs
trembled
and
he
shifted
his
position
a
little
half
lifting
his
strong
spliced
hunting
bow
as
he
did
so
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
silence
about
them
except
for
the
distant
cries
and
once
for
the
stamp
of
a
horse
behind
them
then
sir
nicholas
made
a
quick
movement
and
dropped
his
hands
again
a
single
rabbit
had
cantered
out
from
the
growth
opposite
and
sat
up
with
cocked
ears
staring
straight
at
the
deadly
shelter
then
another
followed
and
again
in
a
sudden
panic
the
two
little
furry
bodies
whisked
back
into
cover
ralph
marvelled
at
this
strange
passion
that
could
set
a
reasonable
man
twitching
and
panting
like
the
figure
in
front
of
him
he
himself
was
a
good
rider
and
a
sufficiently
keen
hunter
when
his
blood
was
up
but
this
of
his
seemed
to
live
for
little
else
day
after
day
as
ralph
knew
from
the
beginning
of
the
season
to
the
end
he
was
out
with
his
men
and
hounds
and
the
rest
of
the
year
he
seemed
to
spend
in
talking
about
the
sport
fingering
and
oiling
his
weapons
through
long
mornings
and
elaborating
future
campaigns
in
which
the
chances
should
be
reduced
to
a
minimum
on
a
sudden
sir
nicholas
figure
stiffened
and
then
relaxed
a
doe
had
stepped
out
noiselessly
from
the
cover
head
up
and
feet
close
together
sniffing
up
wind
and
they
were
shooting
no
does
this
month
then
again
she
moved
along
against
the
thick
undergrowth
stepping
delicately
and
silently
and
vanished
without
a
sound
a
hundred
yards
along
to
the
left
the
cries
and
taps
were
sounding
nearer
now
and
at
any
moment
the
game
might
appear
sir
nicholas
shifted
his
position
again
a
little
and
simultaneously
the
scolding
voice
of
a
blackbird
rang
out
in
front
and
he
stopped
again
at
the
same
moment
a
hare
mad
with
fright
burst
out
of
the
cover
making
straight
for
the
shelter
sir
nicholas
hands
rose
steady
now
the
crisis
had
come
and
ralph
leaning
forward
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
and
pointed
a
great
stag
was
standing
in
the
green
gloom
within
the
wood
eighty
yards
away
with
a
couple
of
does
at
his
flank
then
as
a
shout
sounded
out
near
at
hand
he
bolted
towards
the
shelter
in
a
line
that
would
bring
him
close
to
it
ralph
crouched
down
for
he
had
left
his
bow
with
his
man
an
hour
earlier
and
one
of
the
hounds
gave
a
stifled
yelp
as
nicholas
straightened
himself
and
threw
out
his
left
foot
either
the
sound
or
the
movement
startled
the
great
brown
beast
in
front
and
as
the
arrow
twanged
from
the
string
he
checked
and
wheeled
round
and
went
off
like
the
wind
untouched
a
furious
hiss
of
the
breath
broke
from
nicholas
and
he
made
a
swift
sign
as
he
turned
to
his
horse
and
in
a
moment
the
two
lithe
hounds
had
leapt
from
the
shelter
and
were
flying
in
long
noiseless
leaps
after
the
disappearing
quarry
the
does
confused
by
the
change
of
direction
had
whisked
back
into
cover
a
moment
later
nicholas
too
was
after
the
hounds
his
shoulders
working
and
his
head
thrust
forward
and
a
stirrup
clashed
and
jingled
against
the
saddle
ralph
sat
down
on
the
ground
smiling
it
gave
him
a
certain
pleasure
to
see
such
a
complete
discomfiture
nicholas
was
always
so
amusingly
angry
when
he
failed
and
so
full
of
reasons
the
forest
was
full
of
noises
now
a
crowd
of
starlings
were
protesting
wildly
overhead
there
were
shouts
far
away
and
the
throb
of
hoofs
and
the
ground
game
was
pouring
out
of
the
undergrowth
and
dispersing
in
all
directions
once
a
boar
ran
past
grumbling
as
he
went
turning
a
wicked
and
resentful
eye
on
the
placid
gentleman
in
green
who
sat
on
the
ground
but
who
felt
for
his
long
dirk
as
he
saw
the
fury
on
the
face
and
the
foam
on
the
tusks
but
the
pig
thought
discretion
was
best
and
hurried
on
complaining
more
than
one
troop
of
deer
flew
past
the
does
gathered
round
their
lord
to
protect
him
all
swerving
together
like
a
string
of
geese
as
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
shelter
and
caught
sight
of
ralph
but
the
beaters
were
coming
out
now
whistling
and
talking
as
they
came
and
gathering
into
groups
of
two
or
three
on
the
ground
for
the
work
was
done
and
it
had
been
hot
going
mary
maxwell
appeared
presently
on
her
grey
horse
looking
slender
and
dignified
in
her
green
with
the
great
plume
shading
her
face
and
rode
up
to
ralph
whom
she
had
seen
earlier
in
the
afternoon
my
husband
she
enquired
looking
down
at
ralph
who
was
lying
with
his
hat
over
his
eyes
he
left
me
just
now
said
her
brother
very
hot
and
red
after
a
stag
which
he
missed
that
will
mean
some
conversation
minnie
she
smiled
down
at
him
i
shall
agree
with
him
you
know
she
said
of
course
you
will
it
is
but
right
and
i
suppose
i
shall
too
will
you
wait
for
him
tell
him
we
are
going
home
by
the
mill
it
is
all
over
now
ralph
nodded
and
mary
moved
off
down
the
glade
to
join
the
others
ralph
began
to
wonder
how
nicholas
would
take
the
news
of
decision
mary
he
knew
very
well
would
assent
to
it
quietly
as
she
did
to
all
normal
events
even
though
they
were
not
what
she
would
have
wished
and
probably
her
husband
would
assent
too
for
he
had
a
great
respect
for
a
churchman
for
himself
his
opinions
were
divided
and
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
thought
from
the
temporal
point
of
view
step
would
be
an
advantage
to
him
for
the
vow
of
poverty
would
put
an
end
to
any
claims
upon
the
estate
on
the
part
of
the
younger
son
but
ralph
was
sufficiently
generous
not
to
pay
much
attention
to
this
from
the
social
point
of
view
no
great
difference
would
be
made
it
was
as
respectable
to
have
a
monk
for
a
brother
as
a
small
squire
and
chris
could
never
be
more
than
this
unless
he
made
a
good
marriage
from
the
spiritual
point
of
view
and
here
ralph
stopped
and
wondered
whether
it
was
very
seriously
worth
considering
it
was
the
normal
thing
of
course
to
believe
in
the
sublimity
of
the
religious
life
and
its
peculiar
dignity
but
the
new
learning
was
beginning
to
put
questions
on
the
subject
that
had
very
considerably
affected
the
normal
view
in
eyes
in
that
section
of
society
where
new
ideas
are
generated
and
to
which
ralph
himself
belonged
there
were
very
odd
tales
being
told
and
it
was
beginning
to
be
thought
possible
that
monasticism
had
itself
and
that
in
trying
to
convert
the
world
it
had
itself
been
converted
by
the
world
ralph
was
proud
enough
of
the
honour
of
his
family
to
wonder
whether
it
was
an
unmixed
gain
that
his
own
brother
should
join
such
ranks
as
these
and
lastly
there
were
the
facts
that
he
had
learnt
from
his
association
with
cromwell
that
made
him
hesitate
more
than
ever
in
giving
chris
his
sympathy
he
had
been
thinking
these
points
over
in
the
parlour
the
night
before
when
the
others
had
left
him
and
during
the
day
in
the
intervals
of
the
sport
and
he
was
beginning
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
all
things
considered
he
had
better
just
acquiesce
in
the
situation
and
neither
praise
nor
blame
overmuch
it
was
a
sleepy
afternoon
the
servants
had
all
gone
by
now
and
the
and
noises
had
died
away
in
the
direction
of
the
mill
there
was
no
leisure
for
stags
to
bray
as
they
crouched
now
far
away
in
the
bracken
listening
and
for
the
sounds
of
pursuit
only
the
hum
of
insect
life
in
the
hot
evening
sunshine
filled
the
air
and
ralph
began
to
fall
asleep
his
back
against
a
fallen
trunk
then
he
suddenly
awakened
and
saw
his
black
against
the
sky
looking
down
at
him
from
the
saddle
well
said
ralph
not
moving
nicholas
began
to
explain
there
were
a
hundred
reasons
it
seemed
for
his
coming
home
and
where
were
his
men
they
are
all
gone
home
said
ralph
getting
up
and
stretching
himself
i
waited
for
you
it
is
all
over
you
understand
said
nicholas
putting
his
horse
into
motion
and
beginning
to
explain
all
over
again
you
understand
that
it
had
not
been
for
that
foul
hound
yelping
i
should
have
had
him
here
i
never
miss
such
a
shot
and
then
when
we
went
after
him
i
understand
perfectly
nick
said
ralph
you
missed
him
because
you
did
not
shoot
straight
and
you
did
not
catch
him
because
you
did
not
go
fast
enough
a
lawyer
could
say
no
more
nicholas
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
loudly
for
the
two
were
good
friends
well
if
you
will
have
it
he
said
i
was
a
damned
fool
there
a
lawyer
dare
not
say
as
much
not
to
me
at
any
rate
ralph
found
his
man
half
a
mile
further
on
coming
to
meet
him
with
his
horse
and
he
mounted
and
rode
on
with
nicholas
towards
the
mill
i
have
something
to
tell
you
he
said
presently
chris
is
to
be
a
monk
mother
of
god
cried
nicholas
half
checking
his
horse
and
when
was
that
arranged
last
night
went
on
ralph
he
went
to
see
the
holy
maid
at
sepulchre
and
it
seems
that
she
told
him
he
had
a
vocation
so
there
is
an
end
of
it
and
what
do
you
all
think
of
it
asked
the
other
oh
i
suppose
he
knows
his
business
nicholas
asked
a
number
of
questions
and
was
informed
that
chris
proposed
to
go
to
lewes
in
a
month
time
he
was
already
the
prior
had
given
his
conditional
consent
before
and
there
was
no
need
for
waiting
yes
they
were
cluniacs
but
ralph
believed
that
they
were
far
from
strict
just
at
present
it
need
not
be
the
end
of
chris
so
far
as
this
world
was
concerned
but
you
must
not
say
that
to
him
he
went
on
he
thinks
it
is
heaven
itself
between
four
walls
and
we
shall
have
a
great
scene
of
farewell
i
think
i
must
go
back
to
town
before
it
takes
place
i
can
not
do
that
kind
of
thing
nicholas
was
not
attending
and
rode
on
in
silence
for
a
few
yards
sucking
in
his
lower
lip
we
are
lucky
fellows
you
and
i
he
said
at
last
to
have
a
monk
to
pray
for
us
ralph
glanced
at
him
for
he
was
perfectly
grave
and
a
rather
intent
and
awed
look
was
in
his
eyes
i
think
a
deal
of
that
he
went
on
though
i
can
not
talk
to
a
churchman
as
i
should
i
had
a
terrible
time
with
my
lord
of
canterbury
last
year
at
otford
he
was
not
a
hunter
like
this
one
and
i
knew
not
what
else
to
speak
of
ralph
eyes
narrowed
with
amusement
what
did
you
say
to
him
he
asked
i
forget
said
nicholas
and
i
hope
my
lord
did
mary
told
me
i
behaved
like
a
fool
but
this
one
is
better
i
hear
he
is
at
ashford
now
with
his
hounds
they
talked
a
little
more
about
chris
and
ralph
soon
saw
on
which
side
nicholas
ranged
himself
it
was
an
unfeigned
pleasure
to
this
hunting
squire
to
have
a
monk
for
a
there
was
no
knowing
how
short
purgatory
might
not
be
for
them
all
under
the
circumstances
it
was
evident
too
when
they
came
up
with
the
others
a
couple
of
miles
further
on
that
nicholas
attitude
towards
the
young
man
had
undergone
a
change
he
looked
at
him
with
a
deep
respect
refrained
from
criticising
his
bloodless
hands
and
was
soon
riding
on
in
front
beside
him
talking
eagerly
and
deferentially
while
ralph
followed
with
mary
and
his
father
you
have
heard
he
said
to
her
presently
father
has
just
told
me
she
said
we
are
very
much
pleased
dear
chris
and
then
there
is
meg
put
in
her
father
oh
meg
yes
i
knew
she
would
she
is
made
for
a
nun
sir
james
edged
his
horse
in
presently
close
to
ralph
as
mary
went
in
front
through
a
narrow
opening
in
the
wood
be
good
to
him
he
said
he
thinks
so
much
of
you
ralph
glanced
up
and
smiled
into
the
tender
keen
eyes
that
were
looking
into
his
own
why
of
course
sir
he
said
it
was
an
immense
pleasure
to
chris
to
notice
the
difference
in
nicholas
behaviour
towards
him
there
was
none
of
that
loud
and
cheerful
rallying
that
stood
for
humour
no
criticisms
of
his
riding
or
his
costume
the
squire
asked
him
a
hundred
questions
almost
nervously
about
the
holy
maid
and
himself
and
what
had
passed
between
them
they
say
the
host
was
carried
to
her
through
the
air
from
calais
chris
when
the
king
was
there
did
you
hear
her
speak
of
that
chris
shook
his
head
there
was
not
time
he
said
and
then
there
was
the
matter
of
the
divorce
nicholas
turned
his
head
slightly
ralph
can
not
hear
us
can
he
well
the
matter
of
the
divorce
i
hear
she
denounced
that
and
would
have
none
of
it
and
has
written
to
the
pope
too
they
were
saying
something
of
the
kind
said
chris
but
i
thought
it
best
not
to
meddle
and
what
did
she
say
to
you
chris
told
him
the
story
and
nicholas
eyes
grew
round
and
fixed
as
he
listened
his
mouth
was
a
little
open
and
he
murmured
inarticulate
comments
as
they
rode
together
up
from
the
mill
lord
he
said
at
last
and
she
said
all
that
about
hell
god
save
us
and
her
tongue
out
of
her
mouth
all
the
while
and
did
you
see
anything
yourself
no
devils
or
angels
i
saw
nothing
said
chris
i
just
listened
but
she
saw
them
lord
said
nicholas
again
and
rode
on
in
profound
silence
the
maxwells
were
to
stay
to
supper
at
the
court
and
drive
home
afterwards
so
there
was
no
opportunity
for
chris
to
go
down
and
bathe
in
the
lake
as
he
usually
did
in
summer
after
a
day
hunting
for
supper
was
at
seven
and
he
had
scarcely
more
than
time
to
dress
nicholas
was
very
talkative
at
supper
and
poured
out
all
that
chris
had
told
him
with
his
usual
lack
of
discretion
for
the
other
had
already
told
the
others
once
all
the
details
that
he
thought
would
interest
them
they
were
talking
about
the
divorce
he
broke
out
and
then
stopped
and
eyed
ralph
craftily
but
i
had
better
not
speak
of
that
here
eh
chris
ralph
looked
blandly
at
his
plate
chris
did
not
mention
that
he
said
tell
us
nick
no
no
cried
nicholas
i
do
not
want
you
to
go
with
tales
to
town
your
ears
are
too
quick
my
friend
then
there
was
that
about
the
host
flying
from
calais
eh
chris
no
no
you
said
you
had
heard
nothing
of
that
chris
looked
up
and
his
face
was
a
little
flushed
no
nick
he
said
there
seems
to
have
been
a
great
deal
that
chris
did
not
tell
us
began
ralph
sir
james
glanced
swiftly
from
his
seat
under
the
canopy
he
told
us
all
that
was
needed
he
said
aha
broke
out
nicholas
again
but
the
holy
maid
said
that
the
king
would
not
live
six
months
if
he
chris
face
was
full
of
despair
and
misery
and
his
father
interrupted
once
more
we
had
better
not
speak
of
that
my
son
he
said
to
nicholas
it
is
best
to
leave
such
things
alone
ralph
was
smiling
broadly
with
tight
lips
by
now
by
my
soul
nick
you
are
the
maddest
i
have
ever
heard
all
our
heads
might
go
for
what
you
have
said
thank
god
the
servants
are
gone
nick
cried
mary
imploringly
do
hold
your
tongue
lady
torridon
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
serene
amusement
and
there
was
an
odd
pause
such
as
generally
fell
when
she
showed
signs
of
speaking
her
lips
moved
but
she
said
nothing
and
ran
her
eyes
over
the
silver
flagons
before
her
when
the
maxwells
had
gone
at
last
and
prayers
were
over
chris
slipped
across
the
court
with
a
towel
and
went
up
to
the
priest
room
over
the
sacristy
carleton
looked
up
from
his
lamp
and
rose
yes
chris
he
said
i
will
come
the
moon
will
be
up
soon
they
went
down
together
through
the
sacristy
door
on
to
the
level
plateaux
of
lawns
that
stretched
step
after
step
down
to
the
dark
lake
the
sky
was
ablaze
with
stars
and
in
the
east
there
was
a
growing
light
in
the
quarter
where
the
moon
was
at
its
rising
the
woods
beyond
the
water
were
blotted
masses
against
the
sky
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
rich
fragrance
of
the
summer
night
the
two
said
very
little
and
the
priest
stopped
on
the
bank
as
chris
stepped
out
along
the
little
boarded
pier
that
ran
out
among
the
rushes
into
deep
water
there
was
a
scurry
and
a
cry
and
a
dashed
out
from
under
cover
and
sped
across
the
pond
scattering
the
silver
points
that
hung
there
motionless
reflected
from
the
heaven
overhead
chris
was
soon
ready
and
stood
there
a
moment
a
pale
figure
in
the
gloom
watching
the
shining
dots
rock
back
again
in
the
ripples
to
motionlessness
then
he
lifted
his
hands
and
plunged
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
rose
to
the
surface
again
as
if
he
were
swimming
between
two
sides
as
he
moved
softly
out
across
the
middle
and
a
little
ripple
moved
before
him
the
water
was
invisible
there
was
only
a
fathomless
gulf
as
deep
below
as
the
sky
was
high
above
pricked
with
stars
as
he
turned
his
head
this
way
and
that
the
great
trees
high
overhead
seemed
less
real
than
those
two
immeasurable
spaces
above
and
beneath
there
was
a
dead
silence
everywhere
only
broken
by
the
faint
suck
of
the
water
over
his
shoulder
and
an
indescribably
sweet
coolness
that
thrilled
him
like
a
strain
of
music
under
its
influence
again
as
last
night
the
tangible
irritating
world
seemed
to
sink
out
of
his
soul
here
he
was
a
living
creature
alone
in
a
great
silence
with
god
and
nothing
else
was
of
any
importance
he
turned
on
his
back
and
there
was
the
dark
figure
on
the
bank
watching
him
and
above
it
the
great
towered
house
with
its
lighted
windows
along
its
eastern
side
telling
him
of
the
world
of
men
and
passion
look
came
the
priest
voice
and
he
turned
again
and
over
the
further
bank
between
two
tall
trees
shone
a
great
silver
rim
of
the
rising
moon
a
path
of
glory
was
struck
now
across
the
black
water
and
he
pleased
himself
by
travelling
up
it
towards
the
remote
splendour
noticing
as
he
went
how
shadows
had
sprung
into
being
in
that
moment
and
how
the
same
light
that
made
the
glory
made
the
dark
as
well
his
soul
seemed
to
emerge
a
stage
higher
yet
from
the
limits
in
which
the
hot
day
and
the
shouting
and
the
horns
and
the
crowded
woods
had
fettered
it
how
remote
and
little
seemed
ralph
sneers
and
indiscretions
and
mary
pity
here
he
moved
round
in
a
cooler
and
serener
mood
that
keen
mood
whether
physical
or
spiritual
he
did
not
care
to
ask
made
him
inarticulate
as
he
walked
up
with
the
priest
ten
minutes
later
but
carleton
seemed
to
understand
there
are
some
things
besides
the
divorce
best
not
talked
about
he
said
and
i
think
bathing
by
starlight
is
one
of
them
they
passed
under
the
chapel
window
presently
and
chris
noticed
with
an
odd
sensation
of
pleasure
the
little
translucent
patch
of
colour
between
the
slender
mullions
thrown
by
the
lamp
within
a
kind
of
reflex
or
of
the
broad
light
shining
over
the
water
come
up
for
a
while
went
on
the
priest
as
they
reached
the
if
you
are
not
too
tired
the
two
went
through
the
locking
it
behind
them
and
up
the
winding
stairs
in
the
turret
at
the
corner
to
the
priest
chamber
chris
threw
himself
down
relaxed
and
happy
in
the
tall
chair
by
the
window
where
he
could
look
out
and
see
the
moon
clear
of
the
trees
now
riding
high
in
heaven
that
was
a
pity
at
supper
said
the
priest
presently
as
he
sat
at
the
table
i
love
sir
nicholas
and
think
him
a
good
christian
but
he
is
scarcely
a
discreet
one
tell
me
father
broke
out
chris
what
is
going
to
happen
carleton
looked
at
him
smiling
he
had
a
pleasant
ugly
face
with
little
kind
eyes
and
sensitive
mouth
you
must
ask
ralph
he
said
or
rather
you
must
not
but
he
knows
more
than
any
of
us
i
wish
he
would
not
speak
like
that
dear
lad
said
the
priest
you
must
not
feel
it
like
that
remember
our
lord
bore
contempt
as
well
as
pain
there
was
silence
a
moment
and
then
chris
began
again
tell
me
about
lewes
father
what
will
it
be
like
it
will
be
bitterly
hard
said
the
priest
deliberately
christ
church
was
too
bitter
for
me
as
you
know
i
came
out
after
six
months
and
the
cluniacs
are
harder
i
do
not
know
if
i
lost
my
vocation
or
found
it
but
i
am
not
the
man
to
advise
you
in
either
case
ralph
thinks
it
is
easy
enough
he
told
me
last
night
in
the
carriage
that
i
need
not
trouble
myself
and
that
monks
had
a
very
pleasant
time
he
began
to
tell
me
some
tale
about
glastonbury
but
i
would
not
hear
it
ah
said
the
chaplain
regretfully
the
world
standard
for
monks
is
always
high
but
you
will
find
it
hard
enough
especially
in
the
first
year
but
as
i
said
i
am
not
the
man
to
advise
you
i
failed
chris
looked
at
him
with
something
of
pity
in
his
heart
as
the
priest
fingered
the
iron
pen
on
the
table
and
stared
with
pursed
lips
and
frowning
forehead
the
chaplain
was
extraordinarily
silent
in
public
just
carrying
on
sufficient
conversation
not
to
be
peculiar
or
to
seem
morose
but
he
spoke
more
freely
to
chris
and
would
often
spend
an
hour
or
two
in
mysterious
talk
with
sir
james
chris
father
had
a
very
marked
respect
for
the
priest
and
had
had
more
than
one
sharp
word
with
his
wife
ten
years
before
when
he
had
first
come
to
the
house
and
had
found
lady
torridon
prepared
to
treat
her
chaplain
with
the
kind
of
respect
that
she
gave
to
her
butler
but
the
chaplain
position
was
secured
by
now
owing
in
a
large
measure
to
his
own
tact
and
unobtrusiveness
and
he
went
about
the
house
a
quiet
sedate
figure
of
considerable
dignity
and
impressiveness
performing
his
duties
punctually
and
keeping
his
counsel
he
had
been
tutor
to
both
the
sons
for
a
while
to
ralph
only
for
a
few
months
but
to
chris
since
his
twelfth
birthday
and
the
latter
had
formed
with
him
a
kind
of
peaceful
confederacy
often
looking
in
on
him
at
unusual
hours
always
finding
him
genial
although
very
rarely
confidential
it
was
to
carleton
too
that
chris
owed
his
first
drawings
to
the
mystical
life
of
prayer
there
was
a
shelf
of
little
books
in
the
corner
by
the
window
of
the
priest
room
from
which
he
would
read
to
the
boy
aloud
first
translating
them
into
english
as
he
went
and
then
as
studies
progressed
reading
the
latin
as
it
stood
and
that
mysteriously
fascinating
world
in
which
great
souls
saw
and
heard
eternal
things
and
talked
familiarly
with
the
saviour
and
his
blessed
mother
had
first
dawned
on
the
boy
there
new
little
books
too
appeared
from
time
to
time
and
the
volumes
had
overflowed
their
original
home
and
from
that
fact
christopher
gathered
that
the
priest
though
he
had
left
the
external
life
of
religion
still
followed
after
the
elusive
spirit
that
was
its
soul
but
tell
me
he
said
again
as
the
priest
laid
the
pen
down
and
sat
back
in
his
chair
crossing
his
buckled
feet
beneath
the
cassock
tell
me
why
is
it
so
hard
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
discipline
or
the
food
it
is
the
silence
said
the
priest
looking
at
him
i
love
silence
said
chris
eagerly
yes
you
love
an
hour
or
two
or
there
would
be
no
hope
of
a
vocation
for
you
but
i
do
not
think
you
will
love
a
year
however
i
may
be
wrong
but
it
is
the
day
after
day
that
is
difficult
and
there
is
no
relaxation
not
even
in
the
infirmary
you
will
have
to
learn
signs
in
your
novitiate
that
is
almost
the
first
exercise
the
priest
got
up
and
fetched
a
little
book
from
the
corner
cupboard
listen
he
said
and
then
began
to
read
aloud
the
instructions
laid
down
for
the
of
novices
how
they
were
to
make
a
circle
in
the
air
for
bread
since
it
was
round
a
motion
of
drinking
for
water
and
so
forth
you
see
he
said
you
are
not
even
allowed
to
speak
when
you
ask
for
necessaries
and
you
know
silence
has
its
peculiar
temptations
as
well
as
its
joys
there
is
accidie
and
scrupulousness
and
contempt
of
others
and
a
host
of
snares
that
you
know
little
of
now
but
began
chris
oh
yes
it
has
its
joys
and
gives
a
peculiar
strength
chris
knew
of
course
well
enough
by
now
in
an
abstract
way
what
the
religious
discipline
would
mean
but
he
wished
to
have
it
made
more
concrete
by
examples
and
he
sat
long
with
the
chaplain
asking
him
questions
carleton
had
been
as
he
said
in
the
novitiate
at
canterbury
for
a
few
months
and
was
able
to
tell
him
a
good
deal
about
the
life
there
but
the
differences
between
the
augustinians
and
the
cluniacs
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
go
with
any
minuteness
into
the
life
of
the
priory
at
lewes
he
warned
him
however
of
the
tendency
that
every
soul
found
in
silence
to
think
itself
different
from
others
and
of
so
peculiar
a
constitution
that
ordinary
rules
did
not
apply
to
it
he
laid
so
much
stress
on
this
that
the
other
was
astonished
but
it
is
true
said
chris
no
two
souls
are
the
same
the
priest
smiled
yes
that
is
true
too
no
two
sheep
are
the
same
but
the
sheep
nature
is
one
and
you
will
have
to
learn
that
for
yourself
a
religious
rule
is
drawn
up
for
many
not
for
one
and
each
must
learn
to
conform
himself
it
was
through
that
i
failed
myself
i
remembered
that
i
was
different
from
others
and
forgot
that
i
was
the
same
carleton
seemed
to
take
a
kind
of
melancholy
pleasure
in
returning
to
what
he
considered
his
own
failure
and
chris
began
to
wonder
whether
the
thought
of
it
was
not
the
secret
of
that
slight
indication
to
moroseness
that
he
had
noticed
in
him
the
moon
was
high
and
clear
by
now
and
chris
often
leaned
his
cheek
on
the
sash
as
the
priest
talked
and
watched
that
steady
shining
shield
go
up
the
sky
and
the
familiar
view
of
lawns
and
water
and
trees
ghostly
and
mystical
now
in
the
pale
light
the
court
was
silent
as
he
passed
through
it
near
midnight
as
the
household
had
been
long
in
bed
the
flaring
link
had
been
extinguished
two
hours
before
and
the
shadows
of
the
tall
chimneys
lay
black
and
precise
at
his
feet
across
the
great
whiteness
on
the
western
side
of
the
yard
again
the
sense
of
the
smallness
of
himself
and
his
surroundings
of
the
vastness
of
all
else
poured
over
his
soul
these
little
piled
bricks
and
stones
the
lawns
and
woods
round
about
even
england
and
the
world
itself
he
thought
as
his
mind
shot
out
towards
the
stars
and
the
unfathomable
spaces
all
these
were
but
very
tiny
things
negligeable
quantities
when
he
looked
at
them
in
the
eternal
light
it
was
this
thought
after
all
that
was
calling
him
out
of
the
world
and
had
been
calling
him
fitfully
ever
since
his
soul
awoke
eight
years
ago
and
knew
herself
and
her
god
and
his
heart
expanded
and
grew
tremulous
as
he
remembered
once
more
that
his
vocation
had
been
sealed
by
a
divine
messenger
and
that
he
would
soon
be
gone
out
of
this
little
cell
into
the
wide
silent
liberty
of
the
most
dear
children
of
god
chapter
iii
the
arrival
at
lewes
ralph
relented
as
the
month
drew
on
and
was
among
those
who
wished
chris
on
the
afternoon
of
the
july
day
on
which
he
was
to
present
himself
at
lewes
the
servants
were
all
drawn
up
at
the
back
of
the
terrace
against
the
hall
watching
ralph
even
more
than
his
departing
brother
with
the
fascinated
interest
that
the
discreet
and
dignified
friend
of
cromwell
always
commanded
ralph
was
at
his
best
on
such
occasions
genial
and
natural
and
showed
a
pleasing
interest
in
the
girths
of
the
two
horses
and
the
exact
strapping
of
the
couple
of
bags
that
chris
was
to
take
with
him
his
own
man
too
morris
who
had
been
with
him
ever
since
he
had
come
to
london
was
to
ride
with
chris
at
his
master
express
wish
stay
with
him
in
the
that
night
and
return
with
the
two
horses
and
a
precise
report
the
next
morning
you
have
the
hares
for
my
lord
prior
he
said
impressively
looking
at
the
game
that
was
hanging
head
downwards
from
the
servant
saddle
tell
him
that
they
were
killed
on
tuesday
sir
james
and
his
younger
son
were
walking
together
a
few
yards
away
in
deep
talk
and
lady
torridon
had
caused
a
chair
to
be
set
for
her
at
the
top
of
the
terrace
steps
where
she
could
at
once
do
her
duty
as
a
mother
and
be
moderately
comfortable
at
the
same
time
she
hardly
spoke
at
all
but
looked
gravely
with
her
enigmatic
black
eyes
at
the
legs
and
the
luggage
and
once
held
up
her
hand
to
silence
a
small
dog
that
had
begun
to
yelp
with
excitement
they
must
be
going
said
ralph
when
all
was
ready
and
at
the
same
moment
chris
and
his
father
came
up
sir
james
arm
thrown
over
his
son
shoulders
the
farewells
were
very
short
it
was
impossible
to
indulge
in
sentiment
in
the
genial
generated
by
ralph
and
a
minute
later
chris
was
mounted
sir
james
said
no
more
but
stood
a
little
apart
looking
at
his
son
lady
torridon
smiled
rather
pleasantly
and
nodded
her
head
two
or
three
times
and
ralph
with
carleton
stood
on
the
gravel
below
his
hand
on
chris
crupper
smiling
up
at
him
chris
he
said
and
added
with
an
unusual
piety
god
keep
you
as
the
two
horses
passed
through
the
gatehouse
chris
turned
once
again
with
swimming
eyes
and
saw
the
group
a
little
sir
james
and
ralph
were
standing
together
ralph
arm
thrust
through
his
father
carleton
was
still
on
the
gravel
and
lady
torridon
was
walking
very
deliberately
back
to
the
house
the
distance
to
lewes
was
about
fourteen
miles
and
it
was
not
until
they
had
travelled
some
two
of
them
and
had
struck
off
towards
burgess
hill
that
chris
turned
his
head
for
morris
to
come
up
it
was
very
strange
to
him
to
ride
through
that
familiar
country
where
he
had
ridden
hundreds
of
times
before
and
to
know
that
this
was
probably
the
last
time
that
he
would
pass
along
those
lanes
at
least
under
the
same
circumstances
it
had
the
same
effect
on
him
as
a
death
in
the
house
would
have
the
familiar
things
were
the
same
but
they
wore
a
new
and
strange
significance
the
few
men
and
children
he
passed
saluted
him
deferentially
as
usual
and
then
turned
fifty
yards
further
on
and
stared
at
the
young
gentleman
who
as
they
knew
was
riding
off
on
such
an
errand
and
with
such
grave
looks
morris
came
up
with
an
eager
respectfulness
at
chris
sign
keeping
a
yard
or
two
away
lest
the
swinging
luggage
on
his
own
horse
should
discompose
the
master
and
answered
a
formal
question
or
two
about
the
roads
and
the
bags
which
chris
put
to
him
as
a
gambit
of
conversation
the
servant
was
clever
and
well
trained
and
knew
how
to
modulate
his
attitude
to
the
precise
degree
of
deference
due
to
his
master
and
his
master
relations
he
had
entered
ralph
service
from
cromwell
own
eight
years
before
he
liked
nothing
better
than
to
talk
of
london
and
his
experiences
there
and
selected
with
considerable
skill
the
topics
that
he
knew
would
please
in
each
case
now
he
was
soon
deep
on
the
subject
of
wolsey
pausing
respectfully
now
and
again
for
corroboration
or
to
ask
a
question
the
answer
to
which
he
knew
a
good
deal
better
than
chris
himself
i
understand
sir
that
the
lord
cardinal
had
a
wonderful
deal
of
furniture
at
york
house
i
saw
some
of
it
at
master
cromwell
his
grace
sent
it
to
him
at
least
so
i
heard
is
that
so
sir
chris
said
he
did
not
know
well
i
believe
it
was
so
sir
there
was
a
chair
there
set
with
agates
and
pearl
that
i
think
i
heard
ralph
say
had
come
from
there
did
you
ever
see
my
lord
sir
chris
said
he
had
seen
him
once
in
a
narrow
street
at
westminster
but
the
crowd
was
so
great
he
could
not
get
near
ah
sir
then
you
never
saw
him
go
in
state
i
remember
once
seeing
him
sir
going
down
to
hampton
court
with
his
gentlemen
bearing
the
silver
pillars
before
him
and
the
two
priests
with
crosses
what
might
the
pillars
mean
sir
again
chris
confessed
he
did
not
know
ah
sir
said
morris
reflectively
as
if
he
had
received
a
satisfactory
answer
and
there
was
his
saddle
christopher
with
stirrups
and
red
velvet
set
on
my
lord
mule
and
there
was
the
red
hat
borne
in
front
by
another
gentleman
at
mass
too
he
would
be
served
by
none
under
the
rank
of
an
earl
and
i
heard
that
he
would
have
a
duke
sometimes
for
his
lavabo
i
heard
ralph
say
that
there
was
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
carts
that
went
with
the
lord
cardinal
up
to
cawood
and
that
was
after
the
king
grace
had
broken
with
him
sir
and
he
was
counted
a
poor
man
chris
asked
what
was
in
the
carts
just
his
stuff
sir
said
morris
reverentially
the
servant
seemed
to
take
a
melancholy
pleasure
in
recounting
these
glories
but
was
most
discreet
about
the
political
aspects
of
wolsey
although
chris
tried
hard
to
get
him
to
speak
and
he
would
neither
praise
nor
blame
the
fallen
prelate
he
was
more
frank
however
about
campeggio
who
as
an
italian
was
a
less
dangerous
target
he
was
not
a
good
man
i
fear
christopher
they
told
some
very
queer
tales
of
him
when
he
was
over
here
but
he
could
ride
sir
master
maxwell
man
told
me
near
as
well
as
my
lord
of
canterbury
himself
you
know
they
say
sir
that
the
archbishop
can
ride
horses
that
none
of
his
grooms
can
manage
but
i
never
liked
to
think
that
a
foreigner
was
to
be
sent
over
to
do
our
business
for
us
and
more
than
ever
not
such
an
one
as
that
he
proceeded
to
talk
a
good
deal
about
campeggio
his
red
silk
and
his
lace
his
gout
his
servants
his
ways
but
it
began
to
get
a
little
tiresome
to
chris
and
soon
after
passing
through
ditchling
morris
having
pointed
across
the
country
towards
fatton
hovel
and
having
spoken
of
the
ghost
of
a
cow
that
was
seen
there
with
two
heads
one
black
and
one
white
fell
gradually
behind
again
and
chris
rode
alone
they
were
coming
up
now
towards
the
downs
and
the
great
rounded
green
shoulders
heaved
high
against
the
sky
gashed
here
and
there
by
white
strips
and
patches
where
the
chalk
glared
in
the
bright
afternoon
sun
ditchling
beacon
rose
to
their
right
a
hundred
feet
higher
than
the
surrounding
hills
and
the
high
country
sloped
away
from
it
parallel
with
their
road
down
to
lewes
the
shadows
were
beginning
to
lie
eastwards
and
to
lengthen
in
long
blue
hollows
and
streaks
against
the
clear
green
turf
chris
wondered
when
he
would
see
that
side
of
the
downs
again
his
ride
was
like
a
kind
of
farewell
progress
and
all
that
he
looked
on
was
dearer
than
it
had
ever
been
before
but
he
comforted
himself
by
the
thought
of
that
larger
world
so
bright
with
revelation
and
so
enchanting
in
its
mystery
that
lay
before
him
he
pleased
himself
by
picturing
this
last
journey
as
a
ride
through
an
overhung
lane
beautiful
indeed
but
dusky
towards
shining
gates
beyond
which
lay
great
tracts
of
country
set
with
palaces
alive
with
wonderful
presences
and
watered
by
the
very
river
of
life
he
did
not
catch
sight
of
lewes
until
he
was
close
upon
it
and
it
suddenly
opened
out
beneath
him
with
its
crowded
roofs
pricked
by
a
dozen
spires
the
norman
castle
on
its
twin
mounds
towering
to
his
left
a
silver
gleam
of
the
ouse
here
and
there
between
the
plaster
and
timber
houses
as
the
river
wound
beneath
its
bridges
and
beyond
all
the
vast
masses
of
the
priory
straight
in
front
of
him
to
the
south
of
the
town
the
church
in
front
with
its
tall
central
tower
a
huddle
of
convent
roofs
behind
all
white
against
the
rich
meadows
that
lay
beyond
the
stream
morris
came
up
as
chris
checked
his
horse
here
see
christopher
he
said
and
the
other
turned
to
see
the
town
gallows
on
the
right
of
the
road
not
fifty
yards
away
with
a
ragged
shape
or
two
hanging
there
and
a
great
bird
rising
heavily
and
winging
its
way
into
the
west
morris
face
bore
a
look
of
judicial
satisfaction
we
are
making
a
sweep
of
them
he
said
and
as
a
terrible
figure
all
rags
and
sores
with
blind
red
eyes
and
toothless
mouth
rose
croaking
and
entreating
from
the
ditch
by
the
road
the
servant
pointed
with
tight
lips
and
solemn
eyes
to
hangman
acre
chris
fumbled
in
his
purse
threw
a
couple
of
groats
on
to
the
ground
and
rode
on
down
the
hill
his
heart
was
beating
fast
as
he
went
down
westgate
lane
into
the
high
street
and
it
quickened
yet
further
as
the
great
bells
in
the
priory
church
began
to
jangle
for
it
was
close
on
vesper
time
and
instinctively
he
shook
his
reins
to
hasten
his
beast
who
was
picking
his
way
delicately
through
the
filth
and
tumbled
stones
that
lay
everywhere
for
the
melodious
roar
seemed
to
be
bidding
him
haste
and
be
welcome
morris
was
close
beside
him
and
remarked
on
this
and
that
as
they
went
the
spire
of
ann
away
to
the
right
with
pancras
bridge
a
swinging
sign
over
an
inn
with
queen
face
erased
but
plainly
visible
under
ann
boleyn
the
tall
mound
beyond
the
priory
crowned
by
a
calvary
and
the
roof
of
the
famous
of
the
priory
a
great
cruciform
structure
with
over
two
thousand
cells
but
christopher
knew
it
all
better
than
the
servant
and
paid
little
attention
and
besides
his
excitement
was
running
too
high
they
came
down
at
last
through
antioch
street
puddingbag
lane
and
across
the
dry
bed
of
the
winterbourne
and
the
gateway
was
before
them
the
bells
had
ceased
by
now
after
a
final
stroke
morris
sprang
off
his
horse
and
drew
on
the
chain
that
hung
by
the
smaller
of
the
two
doors
there
was
a
sound
of
footsteps
and
a
face
looked
out
from
the
grating
the
servant
said
a
word
or
two
the
face
disappeared
and
a
moment
later
there
was
the
turning
of
a
key
and
one
leaf
of
the
rolled
back
chris
touched
his
beast
with
his
heel
passed
through
on
to
the
paved
floor
and
sat
smiling
and
flushed
looking
down
at
the
old
who
beamed
up
at
him
pleasantly
and
told
him
he
was
expected
chris
dismounted
at
once
telling
the
servant
to
take
the
horses
round
to
the
stables
on
the
right
and
himself
went
across
the
open
court
towards
the
west
end
of
the
church
that
rose
above
him
fifty
feet
into
the
clear
evening
air
faced
with
marble
about
the
two
doors
and
crowned
by
the
western
tower
and
the
high
central
spire
beyond
where
the
bells
hung
on
the
right
lay
the
long
low
wall
of
the
offices
with
the
kitchen
jutting
out
at
the
lower
end
and
the
refectory
roof
above
and
beyond
it
the
church
was
full
of
golden
light
as
he
entered
darkening
to
dusk
in
the
chapels
on
either
side
pricked
with
lights
here
and
there
that
burned
before
the
images
and
giving
an
impression
of
immense
height
owing
to
its
narrowness
and
its
length
the
air
was
full
of
rolling
sound
sonorous
and
full
that
echoed
in
the
two
high
vaults
on
this
side
and
that
of
the
high
altar
was
caught
in
the
double
transepts
and
lost
in
the
chapels
that
opened
in
a
corona
of
carved
work
at
the
further
end
for
the
monks
were
busy
at
the
and
the
psalms
rocked
from
side
to
side
as
if
the
nave
were
indeed
a
great
ship
ploughing
its
way
to
the
kingdom
of
heaven
there
were
a
few
seats
at
the
western
end
and
into
one
of
these
christopher
found
his
way
signing
himself
first
from
the
stoup
at
the
door
and
inclining
before
he
went
in
then
he
leaned
his
chin
on
his
hands
and
looked
eagerly
it
was
difficult
to
make
out
details
clearly
at
the
further
end
for
the
church
was
poorly
lighted
and
there
was
no
western
window
the
glare
from
the
white
roads
too
along
which
he
had
come
still
dazzled
him
but
little
by
little
helped
by
his
own
knowledge
of
the
place
he
began
to
see
more
clearly
high
above
him
ran
the
lines
of
the
clerestory
resting
on
the
rounded
norman
arches
broken
by
the
beam
that
held
the
mighty
rood
with
the
figures
of
mary
and
john
on
either
side
and
beyond
yet
higher
on
this
side
of
the
high
altar
rose
the
lofty
air
of
the
vault
ninety
feet
above
the
pavement
to
left
and
right
opened
the
two
western
transepts
and
from
where
he
knelt
he
could
make
out
the
altar
of
martin
in
the
further
one
with
its
apse
behind
the
image
of
pancras
himself
stood
against
a
pillar
with
the
light
from
the
lamp
beneath
flickering
against
his
feet
but
christopher
eyes
soon
came
back
to
the
centre
beyond
the
screen
where
a
row
of
blackness
on
either
side
in
the
stalls
marked
where
the
monks
rested
back
and
where
he
would
soon
be
resting
with
them
there
were
candles
lighted
at
sparse
intervals
along
the
that
shone
up
into
the
faces
bent
down
over
the
wide
pages
beneath
and
beyond
all
rose
the
altar
with
two
steady
flames
crowning
it
against
the
shining
halpas
behind
that
cut
it
off
from
the
four
groups
of
slender
carved
columns
that
divided
the
five
chapels
at
the
extreme
east
figures
sat
about
the
nave
and
christopher
noticed
an
old
man
his
white
hair
falling
to
his
shoulders
two
seats
in
front
beginning
to
nod
gently
with
sleep
as
the
soft
heavy
waves
of
melody
poured
down
lulling
him
he
began
now
to
catch
the
words
as
his
ears
grew
accustomed
to
the
sound
and
he
too
sat
back
to
listen
pax
in
virtute
tua
et
abundantia
in
turribus
tuis
propter
fratres
meos
et
proximos
came
back
the
answer
pacem
de
and
once
more
domum
domini
dei
nostri
quaesivi
bona
then
there
was
a
soft
clattering
roar
as
the
monks
rose
to
their
feet
and
in
double
volume
from
the
bent
heads
sounded
out
the
it
was
overwhelming
to
the
young
man
to
hear
the
melodious
tumult
of
praise
and
to
remember
that
in
less
than
a
week
he
would
be
standing
there
among
the
novices
and
adding
his
voice
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
had
already
come
into
the
heart
of
life
that
he
had
felt
pulsating
round
him
as
he
swam
in
the
starlight
a
month
before
it
was
this
that
was
reality
and
the
rest
illusion
here
was
the
end
for
which
man
was
made
the
direct
praise
of
god
here
were
living
souls
eager
and
alert
on
the
business
of
their
existence
building
up
with
vibration
after
vibration
the
eternal
temple
of
glory
in
which
god
dwelt
once
he
began
to
sing
and
then
stopped
he
would
be
silent
here
until
his
voice
had
been
authorized
to
join
in
that
consecrated
offering
he
waited
until
all
was
over
and
the
two
lines
of
black
figures
had
passed
out
southwards
and
the
sacristan
was
going
round
putting
out
the
lights
and
then
he
too
rose
and
went
out
thrilled
and
excited
into
the
gathering
twilight
as
the
bell
for
supper
began
to
sound
out
from
the
refectory
tower
he
found
morris
waiting
for
him
at
the
entrance
to
the
and
the
two
went
up
the
stairs
at
the
porter
directions
into
the
parlour
that
looked
out
over
the
irregular
court
towards
the
church
and
convent
christopher
sat
down
in
the
window
seat
over
the
roofs
opposite
the
sky
was
still
tender
and
luminous
with
rosy
light
from
the
west
and
a
little
troop
of
pigeons
were
wheeling
over
the
church
in
their
last
flight
before
returning
home
to
their
huge
dwelling
down
by
the
stream
the
porter
had
gone
a
few
minutes
before
and
christopher
presently
saw
him
returning
with
dom
anthony
marks
the
whom
he
had
got
to
know
very
well
on
former
visits
in
a
fit
of
shyness
he
drew
back
from
the
window
and
stood
up
nervous
and
trembling
and
a
moment
later
heard
steps
on
the
stairs
morris
had
slipped
out
and
now
stood
in
the
passage
and
chris
saw
him
bowing
with
a
nicely
calculated
mixture
of
humility
and
independence
then
a
black
figure
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
came
briskly
through
my
dear
chris
he
said
warmly
holding
out
his
hands
and
chris
took
them
still
trembling
and
excited
they
sat
down
together
in
the
and
the
monk
opened
the
casement
and
threw
it
open
for
the
atmosphere
was
a
little
heavy
and
then
flung
his
arm
out
over
the
sill
and
crossed
his
feet
as
if
he
had
an
hour
at
his
disposal
chris
had
noticed
before
that
extraordinary
appearance
of
ease
and
leisure
in
such
monks
and
it
imperceptibly
soothed
him
neither
would
dom
anthony
speak
on
technical
matters
but
discoursed
pleasantly
about
the
party
at
overfield
court
and
the
beauty
of
the
roads
between
there
and
lewes
as
if
chris
were
only
come
to
pay
a
passing
visit
your
horses
are
happy
enough
he
said
we
had
a
load
of
fresh
beans
sent
in
and
you
chris
are
you
hungry
supper
will
be
here
immediately
brother
james
told
the
as
soon
as
you
came
he
seemed
to
want
no
answer
but
talked
on
genially
and
restfully
about
the
commissioners
who
had
come
from
cluny
to
see
after
their
possessions
in
england
and
their
queer
french
ways
dom
philippe
would
not
touch
the
muscadel
at
first
and
now
he
can
not
have
too
much
he
clamoured
for
claret
at
first
and
we
had
to
give
him
some
but
he
knows
better
now
but
he
says
mass
like
a
holy
angel
of
god
and
is
a
very
devout
man
in
all
ways
but
they
are
going
soon
dom
anthony
fulfilled
to
perfection
the
ideal
laid
down
for
a
in
the
custumal
he
showed
indeed
the
cheerful
hospitality
to
guests
by
which
the
good
name
of
the
monastery
was
enhanced
friendships
multiplied
enmities
lessened
god
honoured
and
charity
increased
he
recognised
perfectly
well
the
confused
terror
in
christopher
mind
and
his
anxiety
to
make
a
good
beginning
and
smoothed
down
the
tendency
to
awkwardness
that
would
otherwise
have
shown
itself
he
had
a
happy
tranquil
face
with
wide
friendly
eyes
that
almost
disappeared
when
he
laughed
and
a
row
of
even
white
teeth
as
he
talked
on
christopher
furtively
examined
his
habit
though
he
knew
every
detail
of
it
well
enough
already
he
had
of
course
left
his
cowl
or
singing
gown
in
the
sacristy
on
leaving
the
church
and
was
in
his
black
frock
girded
with
the
leather
belt
and
the
scapular
over
it
hanging
to
the
ground
before
and
behind
his
hood
christopher
noticed
was
creased
and
flat
as
if
he
were
accustomed
to
sit
back
at
his
ease
he
wore
strong
black
leather
boots
that
just
showed
beneath
his
habit
and
a
bunch
of
keys
duplicates
of
those
of
the
camerarius
and
cook
hung
on
his
right
side
he
was
tonsured
according
to
the
benedictine
pattern
and
his
lips
and
cheeks
were
he
noticed
presently
that
christopher
was
eyeing
him
and
put
his
hand
in
friendly
fashion
on
the
young
man
knee
yes
he
said
smiling
yours
is
ready
too
dom
franklin
looked
it
out
and
asked
me
whether
it
would
be
the
right
size
but
of
the
boots
i
am
not
so
sure
there
was
a
clink
and
a
footstep
outside
and
the
monk
glanced
out
supper
is
here
he
said
and
stood
up
to
look
at
the
table
the
polished
clothless
top
laid
ready
with
a
couple
of
wooden
plates
and
knives
a
pewter
tankard
and
bread
there
was
a
plain
chair
with
arms
drawn
up
to
it
the
rest
of
the
room
which
christopher
had
scarcely
noticed
before
was
furnished
plainly
and
efficiently
and
had
just
that
touch
of
ornament
that
was
intended
to
distinguish
it
from
a
cell
the
floor
was
strewn
with
clean
rushes
a
couple
of
iron
candlesticks
stood
on
the
mantelpiece
and
the
white
walls
had
one
or
two
religious
objects
hanging
on
them
a
wooden
crucifix
opposite
the
table
a
framed
card
bearing
an
image
of
pity
with
an
indulgenced
prayer
illuminated
beneath
a
little
statue
of
pancras
on
a
bracket
over
the
fire
and
a
copy
of
rules
for
guests
hung
by
the
low
oak
door
dom
anthony
nodded
approvingly
at
the
table
took
up
a
knife
and
rubbed
it
delicately
on
the
napkin
and
turned
round
we
will
look
here
he
said
and
went
towards
the
second
door
by
the
fire
christopher
followed
him
and
found
himself
in
the
bedroom
furnished
with
the
same
simplicity
as
the
other
but
with
an
iron
bedstead
in
the
corner
a
kneeling
stool
beside
it
with
a
little
french
silver
image
of
mary
over
it
and
a
sprig
of
dried
yew
tucked
in
behind
a
thin
copy
of
the
little
office
of
our
lady
lay
on
the
sloping
desk
with
another
book
or
two
on
the
upper
slab
dom
anthony
went
to
the
window
and
threw
that
open
too
your
luggage
is
unpacked
i
see
he
said
nodding
to
the
press
beside
which
lay
the
two
trunks
emptied
now
by
morris
careful
hands
there
are
some
hares
too
said
christopher
ralph
has
sent
them
to
my
lord
prior
the
porter
has
them
said
the
monk
they
look
strangely
like
a
bribe
and
he
nodded
again
with
a
beaming
face
and
his
eyes
grew
little
and
bright
at
his
own
humour
he
examined
the
bed
before
he
left
the
room
again
turned
back
the
sheets
and
pressed
them
down
and
the
straw
rustled
drily
beneath
glanced
into
the
sweating
earthenware
jug
refolded
the
coarse
towel
on
its
wooden
peg
and
then
smiled
again
at
the
young
man
supper
he
said
briefly
christopher
stayed
a
moment
with
a
word
of
excuse
to
wash
off
the
dust
of
his
ride
from
his
hands
and
face
and
when
he
came
back
into
the
found
the
candles
lighted
the
wooden
shutters
folded
over
the
windows
and
a
basin
of
soup
with
a
roast
pigeon
steaming
on
the
table
the
monk
was
standing
waiting
for
him
by
the
door
i
must
be
gone
chris
he
said
but
i
shall
be
back
before
compline
my
lord
prior
will
see
you
there
is
nothing
more
remember
you
are
at
home
now
and
on
christopher
assurances
that
he
had
all
he
could
need
he
was
gone
leisurely
and
cheerfully
and
his
footsteps
sounded
on
the
stairs
morris
came
up
before
chris
had
finished
supper
and
as
he
silently
slipped
away
his
plate
and
set
another
for
the
cheese
chris
remembered
with
a
nervous
exultation
that
this
would
be
probably
the
last
time
that
he
would
have
a
servant
to
wait
on
him
he
was
beginning
to
feel
strangely
at
home
already
the
bean
soup
was
strong
and
savoury
the
beer
cool
and
he
was
pleasantly
exercised
by
his
ride
morris
too
in
answer
to
his
enquiries
said
that
he
had
been
well
looked
after
in
the
servants
quarters
of
the
and
had
had
an
entertaining
supper
with
an
agreeable
frenchman
who
it
seemed
had
come
with
the
cluniac
commissioners
respect
for
his
master
and
a
sense
of
the
ludicrous
struggled
in
morris
voice
as
he
described
the
foreigner
pronunciation
and
his
eloquent
gestures
he
not
like
a
man
sir
he
said
and
shook
with
reminiscent
laughter
it
was
half
an
hour
before
dom
anthony
returned
and
after
hospitable
enquiries
sat
down
by
chris
again
in
the
wide
and
began
to
talk
he
told
him
that
guests
were
not
expected
to
attend
the
and
that
indeed
he
strongly
recommended
chris
doing
nothing
of
the
kind
at
any
rate
that
night
that
masses
were
said
at
all
hours
from
five
onwards
that
prime
was
said
at
seven
and
was
followed
by
the
for
the
servants
and
of
the
house
breakfast
would
be
ready
in
the
at
eight
the
would
be
said
at
the
and
after
the
daily
chapter
which
followed
it
had
taken
place
the
prior
wished
to
see
christopher
the
high
mass
was
sung
at
ten
and
dinner
would
be
served
at
eleven
he
directed
his
attention
too
to
the
card
that
hung
by
the
door
on
which
these
hours
were
notified
christopher
already
knew
that
for
the
first
three
or
four
days
he
would
have
to
remain
in
the
before
any
formal
step
was
taken
with
regard
to
him
but
he
said
a
word
to
father
anthony
about
this
yes
said
the
monk
my
lord
prior
will
tell
you
about
that
but
you
will
be
here
as
a
guest
until
sunday
and
on
that
day
you
will
come
to
the
morning
chapter
to
beg
for
admission
you
will
do
that
for
three
days
and
then
please
god
you
will
be
clothed
as
a
novice
and
once
more
he
looked
at
him
with
deep
smiling
eyes
chris
asked
him
a
few
more
questions
and
dom
anthony
told
him
what
he
wished
to
know
though
protesting
with
monastic
etiquette
that
it
was
not
his
province
dom
james
berkely
is
the
he
said
you
will
find
him
very
holy
and
careful
the
first
matter
you
will
have
to
learn
is
how
to
wear
the
habit
carry
your
hands
and
to
walk
with
gravity
then
you
will
learn
how
to
bow
with
the
hands
crossed
on
the
knees
so
and
he
illustrated
it
by
a
gesture
if
it
is
a
profound
inclination
and
when
and
where
the
inclinations
are
to
be
made
then
you
will
learn
of
the
custody
of
the
eyes
it
is
these
little
things
that
help
the
soul
at
first
as
you
will
find
like
like
the
bindings
of
a
that
it
may
learn
how
to
grow
and
bear
its
fruit
and
the
rule
will
be
given
you
and
what
a
monk
must
have
by
rote
and
how
to
sing
you
will
not
be
idle
chris
it
was
no
surprise
to
christopher
to
hear
how
much
of
the
lessons
at
first
were
concerned
with
external
behaviour
in
his
visits
to
lewes
before
as
well
as
from
the
books
that
carleton
had
lent
him
he
had
learnt
that
the
perfection
of
the
religious
life
depended
to
a
considerable
extent
upon
minutiæ
that
were
both
aids
to
and
the
result
of
a
tranquil
and
recollected
mind
the
acquirement
of
which
was
part
of
the
object
of
the
monk
ambition
the
ideal
he
knew
was
the
perfect
direction
of
every
part
of
his
being
of
hands
and
eyes
as
well
as
of
the
great
powers
of
the
soul
what
god
had
joined
together
man
must
not
put
asunder
and
the
man
who
had
every
physical
movement
under
control
and
never
erred
through
forgetfulness
or
impulse
in
these
little
matters
presumably
also
was
master
of
his
will
and
retained
internal
as
well
as
external
equanimity
the
great
bell
began
to
toll
presently
for
compline
and
the
rose
in
the
midst
of
his
explanations
my
lord
prior
bade
me
thank
you
for
the
hares
he
said
perhaps
your
servant
will
take
the
message
back
to
ralph
come
they
went
down
the
stairs
together
and
out
into
the
summer
twilight
the
great
strokes
sounding
overhead
in
the
gloom
as
they
walked
over
the
high
wall
to
the
left
shone
a
light
or
two
from
lewes
town
and
beyond
rose
up
the
shadowy
masses
of
the
downs
over
which
christopher
had
ridden
that
afternoon
over
those
hills
too
he
knew
lay
his
old
home
as
they
walked
together
in
silence
up
the
paved
walk
to
the
west
end
of
the
church
a
vivid
picture
rose
before
the
young
man
eyes
of
the
little
parlour
where
he
had
sat
last
night
of
his
silent
mother
in
her
black
satin
his
father
in
the
tall
chair
ralph
in
an
unwontedly
easy
and
genial
mood
lounging
on
the
other
side
and
telling
stories
of
town
of
the
chaplain
with
his
homely
pleasant
face
slipping
silently
out
at
the
door
that
was
the
last
time
that
all
that
was
his
that
he
had
a
right
and
a
place
there
if
he
ever
saw
it
again
it
would
be
as
a
guest
who
had
become
the
son
of
another
home
with
new
rights
and
relations
and
at
the
thought
a
pang
of
uncontrollable
shrinking
pricked
at
his
heart
but
at
the
door
of
the
church
the
monk
drew
his
arm
within
his
own
for
a
moment
and
held
it
and
chris
saw
the
shadowed
eyes
under
his
brows
rest
on
him
tenderly
god
bless
you
chris
he
said
chapter
iv
a
commission
within
a
few
days
of
christopher
departure
to
lewes
ralph
also
left
overfield
and
went
back
to
london
he
was
always
a
little
intolerant
at
home
and
generally
appeared
there
at
his
worst
caustic
silent
and
unsympathetic
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
simple
country
life
was
unbearably
insipid
he
found
there
neither
wit
nor
affairs
to
see
day
after
day
the
same
faces
to
listen
to
the
same
talk
either
on
country
subjects
that
were
distasteful
to
him
or
out
of
compliment
to
himself
political
subjects
that
were
unfamiliar
to
the
conversationalists
was
a
very
hard
burden
and
he
counted
such
things
as
the
price
he
must
pay
for
his
occasional
duty
visits
to
his
parents
he
could
not
help
respecting
the
piety
of
his
father
but
he
was
none
the
less
bored
by
it
and
the
atmosphere
of
silent
cynicism
that
seemed
to
hang
round
his
mother
was
his
only
relief
he
thought
he
understood
her
and
it
pleased
him
sometimes
to
watch
her
to
calculate
how
she
would
behave
in
any
little
domestic
crisis
or
incident
that
affected
her
to
notice
the
slight
movement
of
her
lips
and
her
eyelids
gently
lowering
and
rising
again
in
movements
of
extreme
annoyance
but
even
this
was
not
sufficient
compensation
for
the
other
drawbacks
of
life
at
overfield
court
and
it
was
with
a
very
considerable
relief
that
he
stepped
into
his
carriage
at
last
towards
the
end
of
july
nodded
and
smiled
once
more
to
his
father
who
was
watching
him
from
the
terrace
steps
with
a
wistful
and
puzzled
face
anxious
to
please
and
heard
the
first
crack
of
the
whip
of
his
return
journey
he
had
indeed
a
certain
excuse
for
going
for
a
had
come
down
from
london
with
papers
for
him
from
sir
thomas
cromwell
and
it
was
not
hard
to
assume
a
serious
face
and
announce
that
he
was
recalled
by
affairs
and
there
was
sufficient
truth
in
it
too
for
one
of
the
memoranda
bore
on
the
case
of
elizabeth
barton
the
holy
maid
of
kent
and
announced
her
apprehension
cromwell
however
did
not
actually
recall
him
but
mentioned
the
fact
of
her
arrest
and
asked
if
he
had
heard
much
said
of
her
in
the
country
and
what
the
opinion
of
her
was
in
that
district
the
drive
up
to
london
seemed
very
short
to
him
now
he
went
slowly
through
the
bundle
of
papers
on
which
he
had
to
report
annotating
them
in
order
here
and
there
and
staring
out
of
the
window
now
and
again
with
unseeing
eyes
there
were
a
dozen
cases
on
which
he
was
engaged
which
had
been
forwarded
to
him
during
his
absence
in
the
country
the
priest
at
high
hatch
was
reported
to
have
taken
a
wife
and
cromwell
desired
information
about
this
ralph
had
ridden
out
there
one
day
and
gossipped
a
little
outside
the
parsonage
an
a
few
miles
to
the
north
of
cuckfield
had
talked
against
the
divorce
and
the
reigning
consort
a
mistake
had
been
made
in
the
matter
of
a
preaching
license
and
cranmer
had
desired
cromwell
to
look
into
it
a
house
had
been
sold
in
cheapside
on
which
ralph
had
been
told
to
keep
a
suspicious
eye
and
he
was
asked
his
opinion
on
the
matter
and
such
things
as
these
occupied
his
time
fully
until
towards
four
in
the
afternoon
his
carriage
rolled
up
to
the
at
lambeth
and
he
thrust
the
papers
back
into
his
bag
before
stepping
out
on
arriving
at
his
own
little
house
in
westminster
the
rent
of
which
was
paid
by
his
master
he
left
his
other
servants
to
carry
up
the
luggage
and
set
out
himself
again
immediately
with
morris
in
a
hackney
carriage
for
chancery
lane
as
he
went
he
found
himself
for
the
hundredth
time
thinking
of
the
history
of
the
man
to
whom
he
was
going
sir
thomas
cromwell
was
beginning
to
rise
rapidly
from
a
life
of
adventure
and
obscurity
abroad
he
had
passed
straight
from
the
cardinal
service
to
the
king
three
years
before
and
had
since
then
been
knighted
appointed
master
of
the
and
clerk
of
the
hanaper
in
the
court
of
chancery
at
the
same
time
he
was
actively
engaged
on
his
amazing
system
of
espionage
through
which
he
was
able
to
detect
disaffection
in
all
parts
of
the
country
and
thereby
render
himself
invaluable
to
the
king
who
like
all
the
tudors
while
perfectly
fearless
in
the
face
of
open
danger
was
pitiably
terrified
of
secret
schemes
and
it
was
to
this
man
that
he
was
confidential
agent
was
there
any
limit
to
the
possibilities
of
his
future
ralph
found
a
carriage
drawn
up
at
the
door
and
on
enquiry
heard
that
his
master
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
and
even
as
he
hesitated
in
the
entrance
cromwell
shambled
down
the
stairs
with
a
few
papers
in
his
hand
his
long
sleeveless
cloak
flapping
on
each
step
behind
him
and
his
felt
plumed
cap
on
his
head
in
which
shone
a
yellow
jewel
his
large
dull
face
clean
shaven
like
a
priest
lighted
up
briskly
as
he
saw
ralph
standing
there
and
he
thrust
his
arm
pleasantly
through
his
agent
come
home
to
supper
he
said
and
the
two
wheeled
round
and
went
out
and
into
the
carriage
morris
handed
the
bag
through
the
window
to
his
master
and
stood
as
the
carriage
moved
off
over
the
newly
laid
road
it
would
have
been
a
very
surprising
sight
to
sir
james
torridon
to
see
his
impassive
son
attitude
towards
cromwell
he
was
deferential
eager
to
please
nervous
of
rebuke
and
almost
servile
for
he
had
found
his
hero
in
that
tremendous
personality
he
pulled
out
his
papers
now
shook
them
out
briskly
and
was
soon
explaining
marking
and
erasing
cromwell
leaned
back
in
his
corner
and
listened
putting
in
a
word
of
comment
now
and
again
or
dotting
down
a
note
on
the
back
of
a
letter
and
watching
ralph
with
a
pleasant
oblique
look
for
he
liked
to
see
his
people
alert
and
busy
but
he
knew
very
well
what
his
demeanour
was
like
at
other
times
and
had
at
first
indeed
been
drawn
to
the
young
man
by
his
surprising
insolence
of
manner
and
impressive
observant
silences
that
is
very
well
torridon
he
said
i
will
see
to
the
license
put
them
all
away
ralph
obeyed
and
then
sat
back
too
silent
indeed
but
with
a
kind
of
readiness
for
the
next
subject
but
cromwell
spoke
no
more
of
business
for
the
present
only
uttering
short
sentences
about
current
affairs
and
telling
his
friend
the
news
frith
has
been
burned
he
said
perhaps
you
knew
it
he
was
obstinate
to
the
end
my
lord
bishop
reported
he
threw
saint
chrysostom
and
saint
augustine
back
into
their
teeth
he
gave
great
occasion
to
the
funny
fellows
there
was
one
who
said
that
since
frith
would
have
no
purgatory
he
was
sent
there
by
my
lord
to
find
out
for
himself
whether
there
be
such
a
place
or
not
there
was
a
word
more
about
his
manner
of
going
there
frieth
but
was
not
good
those
funny
fellows
themselves
hewet
went
with
him
to
smithfield
and
hell
ralph
smiled
and
asked
how
they
took
it
oh
very
well
a
priest
bade
the
folk
pray
no
more
for
frith
than
for
a
dog
but
frith
smiled
on
him
and
begged
the
lord
to
forgive
him
his
unkind
words
he
was
going
on
to
tell
him
a
little
more
about
the
talk
of
the
court
when
the
carriage
drove
up
to
the
house
in
throgmorton
street
near
austin
friars
which
cromwell
had
lately
built
for
himself
my
wife
and
children
are
at
hackney
he
said
as
he
stepped
out
we
shall
sup
alone
it
was
a
great
house
built
out
of
an
older
one
superbly
furnished
with
italian
things
and
had
a
large
garden
at
the
back
on
to
which
looked
the
windows
of
the
hall
supper
was
brought
up
almost
immediately
a
couple
of
woodcocks
and
a
salad
and
the
two
sat
down
with
a
pair
of
servants
in
blue
and
silver
to
wait
on
them
cromwell
spoke
no
more
word
of
business
until
the
bottle
of
wine
had
been
set
on
the
table
and
the
servants
were
gone
and
then
he
began
again
immediately
and
what
of
the
country
he
said
what
do
they
say
there
he
took
a
peach
from
the
carved
roundel
in
the
centre
of
the
table
and
seemed
absorbed
in
its
contemplation
ralph
had
had
some
scruples
at
first
about
reporting
private
conversations
but
cromwell
had
quieted
them
long
since
chiefly
by
the
force
of
his
personality
and
partly
by
the
argument
that
a
man
duty
to
the
state
his
duty
to
his
friends
and
that
since
only
talk
that
was
treasonable
would
be
punished
it
was
simpler
to
report
all
conversations
in
general
that
had
any
suspicious
bearing
and
that
he
himself
was
most
competent
to
judge
whether
or
no
they
should
be
followed
up
ralph
too
had
become
completely
reassured
by
now
that
no
injury
would
be
done
to
his
own
status
among
his
friends
since
his
master
had
never
yet
made
direct
use
of
any
of
his
information
in
such
a
manner
as
that
it
was
necessary
for
ralph
to
appear
as
a
public
witness
and
again
too
he
had
pointed
out
that
the
work
had
to
be
done
and
that
was
better
for
the
cause
of
justice
and
mercy
that
it
should
be
done
by
conscientious
rather
than
by
unscrupulous
persons
he
talked
to
him
now
very
freely
about
the
conversations
in
his
house
knowing
that
cromwell
did
not
want
more
than
a
general
specimen
sketch
of
public
feeling
in
matters
at
issue
they
have
great
faith
in
the
maid
of
kent
sir
he
said
my
nicholas
spoke
of
her
prophecy
of
his
grace
death
it
is
the
devout
that
believe
in
her
the
ungodly
know
her
for
a
fool
or
a
knave
hujus
saeculi
prudentiores
quoted
cromwell
gravely
your
i
should
think
was
a
child
of
light
he
is
sir
i
should
have
thought
so
and
what
else
did
you
hear
there
is
a
good
deal
of
memory
of
the
lady
katharine
sir
i
heard
the
foresters
talking
one
day
what
of
the
religious
houses
ralph
hesitated
my
brother
christopher
has
just
gone
to
lewes
he
said
so
i
heard
more
of
the
favourable
side
but
i
heard
a
good
deal
against
them
too
there
was
a
secular
priest
talking
against
them
one
day
with
our
chaplain
who
is
a
defender
of
them
who
was
he
asked
cromwell
with
the
same
sharp
oblique
glance
a
man
of
no
importance
sir
the
parson
of
great
keynes
the
holy
maid
is
in
trouble
went
on
the
other
after
a
silence
she
is
in
my
lord
of
canterbury
hands
and
we
can
leave
her
there
i
suppose
she
will
be
hanged
ralph
waited
he
knew
it
was
no
good
asking
too
much
what
she
said
of
the
king
death
and
the
pestilence
is
enough
to
cast
her
went
on
cromwell
presently
and
bocking
and
hadleigh
will
be
in
his
hands
soon
too
they
do
not
know
their
peril
yet
they
went
on
to
talk
of
the
friars
and
of
the
disfavour
that
they
were
in
with
the
king
after
the
unfortunate
occurrences
of
the
previous
spring
when
father
peto
had
preached
at
greenwich
before
henry
on
the
subject
of
naboth
vineyard
and
the
end
of
ahab
the
oppressor
there
had
been
a
dramatic
scene
cromwell
said
when
on
the
following
sunday
a
canon
of
hereford
curwin
had
preached
against
peto
from
the
same
pulpit
and
had
been
rebuked
from
the
by
another
of
the
brethren
father
elstow
who
had
continued
declaiming
until
the
king
himself
had
fiercely
intervened
from
the
royal
pew
and
bade
him
be
silent
the
two
are
banished
said
cromwell
but
that
is
not
the
end
of
it
their
brethren
will
hear
of
it
again
i
have
never
seen
the
king
so
wrathful
i
suppose
it
was
partly
because
the
lady
katharine
so
cossetted
them
she
was
always
in
the
church
at
the
when
the
court
was
at
greenwich
and
friar
forrest
you
know
was
her
confessor
there
is
a
rod
in
pickle
ralph
listened
with
all
his
ears
cromwell
was
not
very
communicative
on
the
subject
of
the
religious
houses
but
ralph
had
gathered
from
hints
of
this
kind
that
something
was
preparing
when
supper
was
over
and
the
servants
were
clearing
away
cromwell
went
to
the
window
where
the
glass
glowed
overhead
with
his
new
arms
and
scrolls
a
blue
coat
with
cornish
choughs
and
a
rose
on
a
fess
between
three
rampant
lions
and
stood
there
a
steady
formidable
figure
with
his
cropped
head
and
great
jowl
looking
out
on
to
the
garden
when
the
men
had
gone
he
turned
again
to
ralph
i
have
something
for
you
he
said
but
it
is
greater
than
those
other
matters
a
fool
could
not
do
it
sit
down
he
came
across
the
room
to
the
fireplace
as
ralph
sat
down
and
himself
took
a
chair
by
the
table
lifting
the
baudkin
cushion
and
settling
it
again
comfortably
behind
him
it
is
this
he
said
abruptly
you
know
that
master
more
has
been
in
trouble
there
was
the
matter
of
the
gilt
flagon
which
powell
said
he
had
taken
as
a
bribe
and
the
gloves
lined
with
forty
pound
well
he
disproved
that
and
i
am
glad
of
it
glad
of
it
he
repeated
steadily
looking
down
at
his
ring
and
turning
it
to
catch
the
light
but
there
is
now
another
matter
i
hear
he
has
been
practising
with
the
holy
maid
and
hearkening
to
her
ravings
and
that
my
lord
of
rochester
is
in
it
too
but
i
am
not
sure
of
it
cromwell
stopped
glanced
up
at
ralph
a
moment
and
then
down
again
i
am
not
sure
of
it
he
said
again
and
i
wish
to
be
and
i
think
you
can
help
me
ralph
waited
patiently
his
heart
beginning
to
quicken
this
was
a
great
matter
i
wish
you
to
go
to
him
said
his
master
and
to
get
him
into
talk
but
i
do
not
see
how
it
can
be
managed
he
knows
i
am
in
your
service
sir
suggested
ralph
yes
yes
said
cromwell
a
little
impatiently
that
is
it
he
is
no
fool
and
will
not
talk
this
is
what
i
thought
of
that
you
should
go
to
him
from
me
and
feign
that
you
are
on
his
side
in
the
matter
but
will
he
believe
that
he
ended
gloomily
looking
at
the
other
curiously
there
was
silence
for
a
minute
while
cromwell
drummed
his
fingers
softly
on
the
table
then
presently
ralph
spoke
there
is
this
sir
he
said
i
might
speak
to
him
about
my
brother
chris
who
as
i
told
you
has
gone
to
lewes
at
the
maid
advice
and
then
see
what
master
more
has
to
say
cromwell
still
looked
at
him
yes
he
said
that
seems
reasonable
and
for
the
rest
well
i
will
leave
that
in
your
hands
they
talked
a
few
minutes
longer
about
sir
thomas
more
and
cromwell
told
the
other
what
a
quiet
life
the
had
led
since
his
resignation
of
office
of
his
house
at
chelsea
and
the
like
and
of
the
decision
that
he
had
apparently
come
to
not
to
mix
any
further
in
public
affairs
there
is
thunder
in
the
air
he
said
as
you
know
very
well
and
master
more
is
no
mean
he
the
matter
of
the
lady
katharine
and
queen
anne
is
no
friend
of
his
i
think
he
is
wise
to
be
quiet
ralph
knew
perfectly
well
that
this
tolerant
language
did
not
represent
cromwell
true
attitude
towards
the
man
of
whom
they
were
speaking
but
he
assented
to
all
that
was
said
and
added
a
word
or
two
about
sir
thomas
more
learning
and
of
the
pleasant
manner
in
which
he
himself
had
been
received
when
he
had
once
had
had
occasion
to
see
him
before
he
was
throwing
horace
at
me
said
the
other
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
the
last
time
that
i
was
there
i
do
not
know
which
he
loves
best
that
or
his
prayers
again
ralph
recognised
an
animus
cromwell
had
suffered
somewhat
from
lack
of
a
classical
education
but
it
is
a
good
thing
to
love
the
classics
and
devotion
he
went
on
presently
with
a
sententious
air
they
are
solaces
in
time
of
trouble
i
have
found
that
myself
he
glanced
up
at
the
other
and
down
again
i
was
caught
saying
our
lady
matins
one
day
he
said
when
the
cardinal
was
in
trouble
i
remember
i
was
very
devout
that
morning
he
went
on
to
talk
of
wolsey
and
of
his
relations
with
him
and
ralph
watched
that
heavy
smooth
face
become
reminiscent
and
almost
sentimental
if
he
had
but
been
wiser
he
said
i
have
noticed
again
and
again
the
folly
of
wise
men
there
is
always
clay
mixed
with
gold
i
suppose
nothing
but
the
fire
that
fryth
denied
can
purge
it
out
and
my
was
ambition
he
wagged
his
head
in
solemn
reprobation
and
ralph
did
not
know
whether
to
laugh
or
to
look
grave
then
there
fell
a
long
silence
and
cromwell
again
fell
to
fingering
his
taking
it
off
his
thumb
and
rolling
it
on
the
smooth
oak
and
at
last
stood
up
with
a
brisker
air
well
he
said
i
have
a
thousand
affairs
and
my
son
gregory
is
coming
here
soon
then
you
will
see
about
that
matter
remember
i
wish
to
know
what
master
more
thinks
of
her
that
that
i
may
know
what
to
think
ralph
understood
sufficiently
clearly
as
he
walked
home
in
the
evening
light
what
it
was
that
his
master
wanted
it
was
no
less
than
to
catch
some
handle
against
the
though
he
had
carefully
abstained
from
saying
so
ralph
recognised
the
adroitness
and
saw
that
while
the
directions
had
been
plain
and
easy
to
understand
yet
that
not
one
word
had
been
spoken
that
could
by
any
means
be
used
as
a
handle
against
cromwell
if
anyone
in
england
at
that
time
knew
how
to
wield
speech
it
was
his
master
it
was
by
that
weapon
that
he
had
prevailed
with
the
king
and
still
kept
him
in
check
it
was
that
weapon
rashly
used
by
his
enemies
that
he
was
continually
turning
against
them
and
under
his
tutoring
ralph
himself
had
begun
to
be
practised
in
the
same
art
among
other
causes
too
of
his
admiration
for
cromwell
was
the
latter
extraordinary
business
capacity
there
was
hardly
an
affair
of
any
importance
in
which
he
did
not
have
a
finger
at
least
and
most
of
them
he
held
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
that
not
only
in
the
mass
but
in
their
minutest
details
ralph
had
marvelled
more
than
once
at
the
minutiæ
that
he
had
seen
dotted
down
on
the
backs
of
old
letters
lying
on
his
master
table
matters
of
church
and
state
inextricably
confused
to
other
eyes
was
simple
to
this
man
he
understood
intuitively
where
the
key
of
each
situation
lay
and
dealt
with
them
one
after
another
briefly
and
effectively
and
yet
with
all
this
no
man
wore
an
appearance
of
greater
leisure
he
would
gossip
harmlessly
for
an
hour
and
yet
by
the
end
had
said
all
that
he
wished
to
say
and
generally
learnt
too
from
his
companion
whoever
he
might
be
all
he
wished
to
learn
ralph
had
watched
him
more
than
once
at
this
business
had
seen
delicate
subjects
introduced
in
a
deft
unsuspicious
sentence
that
roused
no
alarm
and
had
marvelled
at
his
power
to
play
with
men
without
their
dreaming
of
what
was
going
forward
and
now
it
was
master
more
that
was
threatened
ralph
knew
well
that
there
was
far
more
behind
the
scenes
than
he
could
understand
or
even
perceive
and
recognised
that
the
position
of
sir
thomas
was
more
significant
than
would
appear
and
that
developments
might
be
expected
to
follow
soon
for
himself
he
had
no
shrinking
from
his
task
he
understood
that
government
was
carried
on
by
such
methods
and
that
more
himself
would
be
the
first
to
acknowledge
that
in
war
many
things
were
permissible
that
would
be
outrageous
in
times
of
peace
and
that
these
were
times
of
war
to
call
upon
a
friend
to
eat
his
bread
and
salt
and
talk
familiarly
with
him
and
to
be
on
the
watch
all
the
while
for
a
weak
spot
through
which
that
friend
might
be
wounded
seemed
to
ralph
trained
now
and
perfected
in
cromwell
school
a
perfectly
legitimate
policy
and
he
walked
homewards
this
summer
evening
pleased
with
this
new
mark
of
confidence
and
anxious
to
acquit
himself
well
in
his
task
the
house
that
ralph
occupied
in
westminster
was
in
a
street
to
the
west
of
the
abbey
and
stood
back
a
little
between
its
neighbours
it
was
a
very
small
one
of
only
two
rooms
in
width
and
one
in
depth
and
three
stories
high
but
it
had
been
well
furnished
chiefly
with
things
brought
up
from
overfield
court
to
which
ralph
had
taken
a
fancy
and
which
his
father
had
not
denied
him
he
lived
almost
entirely
in
the
first
floor
his
bedroom
and
being
divided
by
the
narrow
landing
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
that
led
up
to
the
storey
above
which
was
occupied
by
morris
and
a
couple
of
other
servants
the
lower
storey
ralph
used
chiefly
for
purposes
of
business
and
for
interviews
which
were
sufficiently
numerous
for
one
engaged
in
so
many
affairs
cromwell
had
learnt
by
now
that
he
could
be
trusted
to
say
little
and
to
learn
much
and
the
early
acts
of
many
little
dramas
that
had
ended
in
tragedy
had
been
performed
in
the
two
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
a
good
deal
of
the
in
its
early
stages
connected
with
the
annulling
of
the
king
marriage
with
queen
katharine
had
been
done
there
a
great
canonist
from
a
foreign
university
had
explained
there
his
views
in
broken
english
helped
out
with
latin
to
a
couple
of
men
while
ralph
watched
the
case
for
his
master
and
cromwell
himself
had
found
the
little
retired
house
a
convenience
for
meeting
with
persons
whom
he
did
not
wish
to
frighten
over
much
while
ralph
and
morris
sat
alert
and
expectant
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
with
the
door
open
listening
for
raised
voices
or
other
signs
of
a
quarrel
the
rooms
upstairs
had
been
furnished
with
considerable
care
the
floors
of
both
were
matted
for
the
plan
involved
less
trouble
than
the
continual
laying
of
clean
rushes
the
was
panelled
up
six
feet
from
the
floor
and
the
three
feet
of
wall
above
were
covered
with
really
beautiful
tapestry
that
ralph
had
brought
up
from
overfield
there
was
a
great
table
in
the
centre
along
one
side
of
which
rested
a
set
of
drawers
with
brass
handles
and
in
the
centre
of
the
table
was
a
deep
well
covered
by
a
flap
that
lay
level
with
the
rest
of
the
top
another
table
stood
against
the
wall
on
which
his
meals
were
served
and
the
door
of
a
cupboard
in
which
his
plate
and
knives
were
kept
opened
immediately
above
it
designed
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
there
were
chairs
two
or
three
other
pieces
of
furniture
a
backed
settle
by
the
fire
and
a
row
of
bookshelves
opposite
the
windows
and
over
the
mantelpiece
against
the
tapestry
hung
a
picture
of
cromwell
painted
by
holbein
and
rejected
by
him
before
it
was
finished
ralph
had
begged
it
from
the
artist
who
was
on
the
point
of
destroying
it
it
represented
the
sitter
head
and
shoulders
in
face
showing
his
short
hair
his
shrewd
heavy
face
with
its
double
chin
and
the
furred
gown
below
morris
was
ready
for
his
master
and
opened
the
door
to
him
there
are
some
letters
come
ralph
sir
he
said
i
have
laid
them
on
your
table
ralph
nodded
slipped
off
his
thin
cloak
into
his
servant
hands
without
speaking
laid
down
his
cane
and
went
upstairs
the
letters
were
very
much
what
he
expected
and
dealt
with
cases
on
which
he
was
engaged
there
was
an
entreaty
from
a
country
squire
near
epping
forest
whose
hounds
had
got
into
trouble
with
the
foresters
that
he
would
intercede
for
him
to
cromwell
a
begging
letter
from
a
monk
who
had
been
ejected
from
his
monastery
for
repeated
misconduct
and
who
represented
himself
as
starving
ralph
lifted
this
to
his
nostrils
and
it
smelt
powerfully
of
spirits
and
he
laid
it
down
again
smiling
to
himself
a
torrent
of
explanation
from
a
schoolmaster
who
had
been
reported
for
speaking
against
the
sacrament
of
the
altar
calling
the
saints
to
witness
that
he
was
no
follower
of
fryth
in
such
detestable
heresy
a
dignified
protest
from
a
justice
of
the
peace
in
kent
who
had
been
reproved
by
cromwell
through
ralph
agency
for
acquitting
a
sturdy
beggar
and
who
begged
that
he
might
in
future
deal
with
a
responsible
person
and
this
ralph
laid
aside
smiling
again
and
promising
himself
that
he
would
have
the
pleasure
of
granting
the
request
an
offer
written
in
a
clerkly
hand
from
a
fellow
who
could
not
sign
his
name
but
had
appended
a
cross
to
submit
some
important
evidence
of
a
treasonable
plot
on
the
consideration
of
secrecy
and
a
suitable
reward
a
year
ago
such
a
budget
would
have
given
ralph
considerable
pleasure
and
a
sense
of
his
own
importance
but
business
had
been
growing
on
him
rapidly
of
late
as
his
master
perceived
his
competence
and
it
gave
him
no
thrill
to
docket
this
one
write
a
refusal
to
that
a
guarded
answer
to
another
and
finally
to
open
the
well
of
his
table
and
drop
the
bundle
in
then
he
turned
round
his
chair
blew
out
one
candle
carefully
and
set
to
thinking
about
master
thomas
more
chapter
v
master
more
it
was
not
until
nearly
a
month
later
that
ralph
made
an
opportunity
to
call
upon
sir
thomas
more
cromwell
had
given
him
to
understand
that
there
was
no
immediate
reason
for
haste
his
own
time
was
tolerably
occupied
and
he
thought
it
as
well
not
to
make
a
show
of
hurry
he
wrote
to
sir
thomas
explaining
that
he
wished
to
see
him
on
a
matter
connected
with
his
brother
christopher
and
received
a
courteous
reply
begging
him
to
come
to
dinner
on
the
following
thursday
the
octave
of
the
assumption
as
sir
thomas
thought
it
proper
to
add
it
was
a
wonderfully
pleasant
house
ralph
thought
as
his
wherry
came
up
to
the
foot
of
the
garden
stairs
that
led
down
from
the
lawn
to
the
river
it
stood
well
back
in
its
own
grounds
divided
from
the
river
by
a
wall
with
a
wicket
gate
in
it
there
was
a
little
grove
of
trees
on
either
side
of
it
a
flock
of
pigeons
were
wheeling
about
the
that
rose
into
the
clear
blue
sky
and
from
which
came
a
stroke
or
two
announcing
the
approach
of
as
he
went
up
the
steps
there
was
a
figure
lying
on
its
face
in
the
shadow
by
the
house
as
ralph
came
up
the
path
and
a
small
dog
that
seemed
to
be
trying
to
dig
the
head
out
from
the
hands
in
which
it
was
buried
ceased
his
excavations
and
set
up
a
shrill
barking
the
figure
rolled
over
and
sat
up
the
pleasant
brown
face
was
all
creased
with
laughter
small
pieces
of
grass
were
clinging
to
the
long
hair
and
ralph
to
his
amazement
recognised
the
chancellor
of
england
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
more
rising
and
shaking
himself
i
had
no
idea
you
take
me
at
a
disadvantage
it
is
scarcely
dignified
and
he
stopped
smiling
and
holding
out
one
hand
while
he
stretched
the
other
deprecatingly
to
quiet
that
insistent
barking
ralph
had
a
sensation
of
mingled
contempt
and
sympathy
as
he
took
his
hand
i
had
the
honour
of
seeing
you
once
before
master
more
he
said
why
yes
said
more
and
i
hope
i
cut
a
better
figure
last
time
but
anubis
would
take
no
refusal
but
i
am
ashamed
and
beg
you
will
not
speak
of
it
to
more
she
is
putting
on
a
new
coif
in
your
honour
i
will
be
discreet
said
ralph
smiling
they
went
indoors
almost
immediately
when
sir
thomas
had
flicked
the
grass
sufficiently
off
his
gown
to
escape
detection
and
straight
through
to
the
hall
where
the
table
was
laid
and
three
or
four
girls
were
waiting
your
mother
is
not
here
yet
i
see
said
sir
thomas
when
he
had
made
ralph
known
to
his
daughters
and
the
young
man
had
kissed
them
deferentially
according
to
the
proper
etiquette
i
will
tell
you
somewhat
hush
and
he
broke
off
again
sharply
as
the
door
from
the
stairs
opened
and
a
stately
lady
with
a
rather
solemn
and
uninteresting
face
sailed
in
her
silk
skirts
rustling
behind
her
and
her
fresh
coif
stiff
and
white
on
her
head
a
man
followed
her
in
looking
a
little
dejected
and
made
straight
across
to
where
the
ladies
were
standing
with
an
eagerness
that
seemed
to
hint
at
a
sense
of
escape
alice
said
sir
thomas
this
is
ralph
torridon
of
whom
you
have
heard
me
speak
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
welcome
him
on
the
lawn
just
now
i
saw
you
more
said
his
wife
with
dignity
as
she
took
hand
and
said
a
word
about
the
weather
then
i
will
confess
said
sir
thomas
smiling
genially
round
i
welcomed
torridon
with
the
back
of
my
head
and
with
anubis
biting
my
ears
ralph
felt
strangely
drawn
to
this
schoolboy
kind
of
man
who
romped
with
dogs
and
lay
on
his
stomach
and
was
so
charmingly
afraid
of
his
wife
his
contempt
began
to
melt
as
he
looked
at
him
and
saw
those
wise
twinkling
eyes
and
strong
humorous
mouth
and
remembered
once
more
who
he
was
and
his
reputation
sir
thomas
said
grace
with
great
gravity
and
signed
himself
reverently
before
he
sat
down
there
was
a
little
reading
first
of
the
scriptures
and
a
commentary
on
it
and
then
as
dinner
went
on
ralph
began
to
attend
less
and
less
to
his
hostess
who
indeed
appeared
wholly
absorbed
in
domestic
details
of
the
table
and
with
whispering
severely
to
the
servants
behind
her
hand
and
to
listen
and
look
towards
the
further
end
where
sir
thomas
sat
in
his
tall
chair
his
flapped
cap
on
his
head
and
talked
to
his
daughters
on
either
side
roper
the
man
who
had
come
in
with
more
was
sitting
opposite
ralph
and
seemed
to
be
chiefly
occupied
in
listening
too
a
tall
girl
whom
her
father
had
introduced
by
the
name
of
cecily
sat
between
ralph
and
her
father
not
at
all
cried
sir
thomas
in
answer
to
something
that
ralph
did
not
catch
nothing
of
the
kind
it
was
juno
that
screamed
argus
would
not
condescend
to
it
he
was
occupied
in
dancing
before
the
bantams
ralph
lost
one
of
the
few
remarks
that
more
addressed
to
him
in
wondering
what
this
meant
and
the
conversation
at
the
other
end
swept
round
a
corner
while
he
was
apologising
when
he
again
caught
the
current
sir
thomas
was
speaking
of
wherries
i
would
love
to
row
a
wherry
he
said
the
fellows
do
not
know
their
fortune
they
might
lead
such
sweet
meditative
lives
they
do
not
i
am
well
aware
for
i
have
never
heard
such
blasphemy
as
i
have
heard
from
wherrymen
but
what
opportunities
are
theirs
if
i
were
not
your
father
my
darling
i
would
be
a
wherryman
cognovisses
et
tu
quae
ad
pacem
torridon
would
you
not
be
a
wherryman
if
you
were
not
mr
torridon
i
thought
not
this
morning
said
ralph
as
i
came
here
it
seemed
hot
rowing
against
the
stream
it
is
part
of
the
day
work
said
more
when
i
was
chancellor
i
loved
nothing
more
than
a
hot
summer
day
in
court
for
i
thought
of
my
cool
garden
where
i
should
soon
be
walking
i
must
show
you
the
new
building
after
dinner
mr
torridon
cecily
and
margaret
presently
had
a
short
encounter
across
the
table
on
some
subject
that
ralph
did
not
catch
but
he
saw
margaret
on
the
other
side
flush
up
and
bring
her
lips
sharply
together
sir
thomas
leapt
into
the
breach
leves
animae
tanto
caluere
furore
he
cried
and
glanced
up
at
ralph
to
see
if
he
understood
the
quotation
as
the
two
girls
dropped
their
eyes
ashamed
pares
succubuere
said
ralph
by
a
flash
of
inspiration
and
looking
at
the
girls
sir
thomas
eyes
shone
with
pleasure
i
did
not
know
you
were
such
a
treasure
torridon
now
master
cromwell
could
not
have
done
that
there
fell
a
silence
as
that
name
was
spoken
and
all
at
the
table
eyed
ralph
he
was
saying
as
much
to
me
the
other
day
went
on
ralph
excited
by
his
success
he
told
me
you
knew
horace
too
well
and
that
my
morals
were
corrupted
by
him
went
on
more
i
know
he
thinks
that
but
i
had
the
honour
of
confuting
him
the
other
day
with
regard
to
the
flagon
and
gloves
now
there
is
a
subject
for
martial
torridon
a
corrupt
statesman
who
has
retired
on
his
gains
disproves
an
accusation
of
bribery
let
us
call
him
atticus
attice
we
might
say
that
he
put
on
the
gloves
lest
his
forgers
should
be
soiled
while
he
drank
from
the
flagon
or
something
of
the
kind
sir
thomas
eyes
beamed
with
delight
as
he
talked
to
make
an
apt
classical
quotation
was
like
wine
to
him
but
to
have
it
capped
appropriately
was
like
drunkenness
ralph
blessed
his
stars
that
he
had
been
so
lucky
for
he
was
no
great
scholar
and
he
guessed
he
had
won
his
host
confidence
dinner
passed
on
quietly
and
as
they
rose
from
table
more
came
round
and
took
his
guest
by
the
arm
you
must
come
with
me
and
see
my
new
building
he
said
you
are
worthy
of
it
mr
torridon
he
still
held
his
arm
affectionately
as
they
walked
out
into
the
garden
behind
the
house
and
as
he
discoursed
on
the
joys
of
a
country
life
what
more
can
i
ask
of
god
he
said
he
has
given
me
means
and
tastes
to
correspond
and
what
man
can
say
more
i
see
visions
and
am
able
to
make
them
realities
i
dream
of
a
dovecote
with
a
tiled
roof
and
straightway
build
it
i
picture
a
gallery
and
a
chapel
and
a
library
away
from
the
clack
of
tongues
and
behold
there
it
is
the
eye
can
not
say
to
the
hand
have
no
need
of
thee
to
see
and
dream
without
the
power
of
performance
is
to
perform
without
the
gift
of
imagination
is
the
man
is
blessed
that
hath
both
eye
and
hand
tastes
and
means
alike
it
was
a
very
pleasant
retreat
that
sir
thomas
more
had
built
for
himself
at
the
end
of
his
garden
where
he
might
retire
when
he
wanted
solitude
there
was
a
little
entrance
hall
with
a
door
at
one
corner
into
the
chapel
and
a
long
low
gallery
running
out
from
it
lined
with
bookshelves
on
one
side
and
with
an
open
space
on
the
other
lighted
by
square
windows
looking
into
the
garden
the
polished
boards
were
bare
and
there
was
a
path
marked
on
them
by
footsteps
going
from
end
to
end
here
i
walk
said
more
and
my
friends
look
at
me
from
those
shelves
ready
to
converse
but
never
to
interrupt
shall
we
walk
here
torridon
while
you
tell
me
your
business
ralph
had
indeed
a
touch
of
scrupulousness
as
he
thought
of
his
confidence
but
he
had
learnt
the
habit
of
silencing
impulses
and
of
only
acting
on
plans
deliberately
formed
so
he
was
soon
laying
bare
his
anxiety
about
chris
and
his
fear
that
he
had
been
misled
by
the
holy
maid
i
am
very
willing
more
he
said
that
my
brother
should
be
a
monk
if
it
is
right
but
i
could
not
bear
he
should
be
so
against
leading
how
am
i
to
know
whether
the
maid
words
are
of
god
or
no
sir
thomas
was
silent
a
moment
but
he
had
thoughts
of
it
before
i
suppose
he
said
or
he
would
not
have
gone
to
her
in
fact
you
said
so
ralph
acknowledged
that
this
was
and
for
several
years
went
on
the
other
again
ralph
assented
and
his
tastes
and
habits
are
those
of
a
monk
i
suppose
he
is
long
at
his
prayers
given
to
silence
and
of
a
tranquil
spirit
he
is
not
always
tranquil
said
ralph
he
is
impertinent
sometimes
yes
yes
we
all
are
that
i
was
very
impertinent
to
you
at
dinner
in
trying
to
catch
you
with
martial
his
epigram
though
i
shall
not
offend
again
but
his
humour
may
be
generally
tranquil
in
spite
of
it
well
if
that
is
so
i
do
not
see
why
you
need
trouble
about
the
holy
maid
he
would
likely
have
been
a
monk
without
that
she
only
confirmed
him
but
went
on
ralph
fighting
to
get
back
to
the
point
if
i
thought
she
was
trustworthy
i
should
be
the
more
happy
there
must
always
be
doubtfulness
said
more
in
such
matters
that
is
why
the
novitiate
is
so
severe
it
is
to
show
the
young
men
the
worst
at
once
i
do
not
think
you
need
be
unhappy
about
your
brother
and
what
is
your
view
about
the
holy
maid
asked
ralph
suddenly
delivering
his
point
more
stopped
in
his
walk
cocked
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
like
a
clever
dog
and
looked
at
his
companion
with
twinkling
eyes
it
is
a
delicate
subject
he
said
and
went
on
again
that
is
what
puzzles
me
said
ralph
will
you
not
tell
me
your
opinion
mr
more
there
was
again
a
silence
and
they
reached
the
further
end
of
the
gallery
and
turned
again
before
sir
thomas
answered
if
you
had
not
answered
me
so
briskly
at
dinner
torridon
do
you
know
that
i
should
have
suspected
you
of
coming
to
search
me
out
but
such
a
good
head
i
think
can
not
be
allied
with
a
bad
heart
and
i
will
tell
you
ralph
felt
a
prick
of
triumph
but
none
of
remorse
i
will
tell
you
went
on
more
and
i
am
sure
you
will
keep
it
private
i
think
the
holy
maid
is
a
good
woman
who
has
a
maggot
ralph
spirits
sank
again
this
was
a
very
answer
i
do
not
think
her
a
knave
as
some
do
but
i
think
to
refer
to
what
we
said
just
now
that
she
has
a
large
and
luminous
eye
and
no
hand
worth
mentioning
she
sees
many
visions
but
few
facts
that
tale
about
the
host
being
borne
by
angels
from
calais
to
my
mind
is
nonsense
almighty
god
does
not
work
miracles
without
reason
and
there
is
none
for
that
the
blessed
sacrament
is
the
same
at
dover
as
at
calais
and
a
woman
who
can
dream
that
can
dream
anything
for
i
am
sure
she
did
not
invent
it
on
other
matters
therefore
she
may
be
dreaming
too
and
that
is
why
once
more
i
tell
you
that
to
my
mind
you
can
leave
her
out
of
your
thoughts
with
regard
to
your
brother
she
is
neither
prophetess
nor
pythoness
this
was
very
unsatisfactory
and
ralph
strove
to
remedy
it
and
in
the
matter
of
the
king
death
mr
more
he
said
again
sir
thomas
stopped
in
his
walk
do
you
know
torridon
i
think
we
may
leave
that
alone
he
said
a
little
abruptly
and
ralph
sucked
in
his
lip
and
bit
it
sharply
at
the
consciousness
of
his
own
folly
i
hope
your
brother
will
be
very
happy
went
on
the
other
after
a
moment
and
i
am
sure
he
will
be
if
his
call
is
from
god
as
i
think
likely
i
was
with
the
carthusians
myself
you
know
for
four
years
and
sometimes
i
think
i
should
have
stayed
there
it
is
a
blessed
life
i
do
not
envy
many
folks
but
i
do
those
to
live
in
the
daily
companionship
of
our
blessed
lord
and
of
his
saints
as
those
do
and
to
know
his
secrets
even
the
secrets
of
his
passion
and
its
ineffable
joys
of
pain
that
is
a
very
fortunate
lot
torridon
i
sometimes
think
that
as
it
was
with
christ
natural
body
so
it
is
with
his
mystical
body
there
be
some
members
his
hands
and
feet
and
side
through
which
the
nails
are
thrust
though
indeed
there
is
not
one
whole
spot
in
his
body
erit
inter
viros
aspectus
ejus
nos
putavimus
eum
quasi
but
those
parts
of
his
body
that
are
especially
pained
are
at
once
more
honourable
and
more
happy
than
those
that
are
not
and
the
monks
are
those
happy
members
he
was
speaking
very
solemnly
his
voice
a
little
tremulous
and
his
kindly
eyes
were
cast
down
and
ralph
watched
him
sidelong
with
a
little
awe
and
pity
mingled
he
seemed
so
natural
too
that
ralph
thought
that
he
must
have
his
own
indiscretion
a
shadow
fell
across
the
door
into
the
garden
as
they
came
near
it
and
one
of
the
girls
appeared
in
the
opening
why
meg
cried
her
father
what
is
it
my
darling
beatrice
has
come
sir
said
the
girl
i
thought
you
would
wish
to
know
more
put
out
his
arm
and
laid
it
round
his
daughter
waist
as
she
turned
with
him
come
torridon
he
said
if
you
have
no
more
to
say
let
us
go
and
see
beatrice
there
was
a
group
on
the
lawn
under
one
of
the
lime
trees
two
or
three
girls
and
roper
who
all
rose
to
their
feet
as
the
three
came
up
more
immediately
sat
down
on
the
grass
putting
his
feet
delicately
together
before
him
will
fetch
this
gentleman
a
chair
it
is
not
fit
for
master
cromwell
friend
to
sit
on
the
grass
like
you
and
me
ralph
threw
himself
down
on
the
lawn
instantly
entreating
roper
not
to
move
well
well
said
sir
thomas
let
be
sit
down
too
will
cubito
remanete
torridon
understands
that
i
know
even
if
master
cromwell
friend
does
not
why
as
more
says
i
have
not
said
a
word
to
beatrice
beatrice
this
is
ralph
torridon
and
this
torridon
is
beatrice
her
other
name
is
atherton
but
to
me
she
is
a
feminine
benediction
and
nought
else
ralph
rose
swiftly
and
looked
across
at
a
tall
slender
girl
that
was
sitting
contentedly
on
an
outlying
root
of
the
lime
tree
beside
of
sir
thomas
and
who
rose
with
him
more
can
not
let
my
name
alone
torridon
she
said
tranquilly
as
she
drew
back
after
the
salute
he
made
a
play
upon
it
the
other
day
and
have
been
ashamed
of
it
ever
since
said
more
it
was
sacrilege
with
such
a
name
now
i
am
plain
thomas
and
more
besides
why
did
you
send
for
me
beatrice
i
have
no
defence
said
the
girl
save
that
i
wanted
to
see
you
and
that
is
the
prettiest
defence
you
could
have
made
if
it
does
not
amount
to
corruption
torridon
what
is
the
repartee
to
that
i
need
no
advocate
said
the
girl
i
can
plead
well
enough
ralph
looked
up
at
her
again
with
a
certain
interest
she
seemed
on
marvellously
good
terms
with
the
whole
family
and
had
an
air
of
being
entirely
at
her
ease
she
had
her
black
eyes
bent
down
on
to
a
piece
of
grass
that
she
was
twisting
into
a
ring
between
her
slender
jewelled
fingers
and
her
white
teeth
were
closed
firmly
on
her
lower
lip
as
she
worked
her
long
silk
skirts
lay
out
unregarded
on
the
grass
and
her
buckles
gleamed
beneath
her
voice
was
pleasant
and
rather
deep
and
ralph
found
himself
wondering
who
she
was
and
why
he
had
not
seen
her
before
for
she
evidently
belonged
to
his
class
and
london
was
a
small
place
i
see
you
are
making
one
more
chain
to
bind
me
to
you
said
more
presently
watching
her
she
held
it
up
a
ring
only
she
said
then
it
is
not
for
me
said
more
for
i
do
not
hold
with
melanchthon
nor
yet
solomon
in
the
matter
of
wives
now
torridon
tell
us
all
some
secrets
betray
your
master
we
are
all
agog
leave
off
that
ring
beatrice
and
attend
i
am
listening
said
the
girl
as
serenely
as
before
still
intent
on
her
weaving
the
king
breakfasted
this
morning
at
eight
of
the
clock
said
ralph
gravely
it
is
an
undoubted
fact
i
had
it
on
the
highest
authority
this
is
excellent
said
sir
thomas
let
us
all
talk
treason
i
can
add
to
that
his
grace
had
a
fall
last
night
and
lay
senseless
for
several
hours
he
spoke
with
such
gravity
that
ralph
glanced
up
at
the
same
moment
beatrice
looked
up
from
her
work
and
their
eyes
met
he
fell
asleep
added
sir
thomas
it
was
very
pleasant
to
lie
there
in
the
shadow
of
the
lime
that
afternoon
and
listen
to
the
mild
fooling
and
ralph
forgot
his
manners
and
almost
his
errand
too
and
never
offered
to
move
the
grass
began
to
turn
golden
as
the
sun
slanted
to
the
west
and
the
birds
began
to
stir
after
the
heat
of
the
day
and
to
chirp
from
tree
to
tree
a
hundred
yards
away
the
river
twinkled
in
the
sun
seen
beyond
the
trees
and
the
house
and
the
voices
of
the
boatmen
came
softened
by
distance
and
water
as
they
plied
up
and
down
the
flowing
highway
once
a
barge
went
past
under
the
battersea
bank
with
music
playing
in
the
stern
and
ralph
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
to
watch
it
as
it
went
down
the
stream
with
flags
flying
behind
and
the
rhythmical
throb
of
the
sounding
time
to
the
dancing
melody
ralph
did
his
best
to
fall
in
with
the
humour
of
the
day
and
told
a
good
story
or
two
in
his
slow
voice
among
them
one
of
his
mother
exercising
her
gift
of
impressive
silence
towards
a
tiresome
chatterbox
of
a
man
with
such
effect
that
the
conversationalist
words
died
on
his
lips
after
the
third
or
fourth
pause
made
for
applause
and
comment
he
told
the
story
well
and
lady
torridon
seemed
to
move
among
them
her
skirts
dragging
majestically
on
the
grass
and
her
steady
sombre
face
looking
down
on
them
all
beneath
languid
he
has
never
been
near
us
again
said
ralph
but
he
never
fails
to
ask
after
my
mother
distressing
illness
when
i
meet
him
in
town
he
was
a
little
astonished
at
himself
as
he
talked
for
he
was
not
accustomed
to
take
such
pains
to
please
but
he
was
conscious
that
though
he
looked
round
at
the
faces
and
addressed
himself
to
more
he
was
really
watching
for
the
effect
on
the
girl
who
sat
behind
he
was
aware
of
every
movement
that
she
made
he
knew
when
she
tossed
the
ring
on
the
little
sleeping
brown
body
of
the
dog
that
had
barked
at
him
earlier
in
the
day
and
set
to
work
upon
another
she
slipped
that
on
her
finger
when
she
had
done
and
turned
her
hand
this
way
and
that
her
fingers
bent
back
a
ruby
catching
the
light
as
she
did
so
looking
at
the
effect
of
the
green
circle
against
the
whiteness
but
he
never
looked
at
her
again
except
once
when
she
asked
him
some
question
and
then
he
looked
her
straight
in
her
black
eyes
as
he
answered
a
bell
sounded
out
at
last
again
from
the
tower
and
startled
him
he
got
up
quickly
i
am
ashamed
he
said
smiling
how
dare
i
stay
so
long
it
is
your
kindness
mr
more
nay
nay
said
sir
thomas
rising
too
and
stretching
himself
you
have
helped
us
to
lose
another
day
in
the
pleasantest
manner
possible
you
must
come
again
mr
torridon
he
walked
down
with
ralph
to
the
garden
steps
and
stood
by
him
talking
while
the
wherry
that
had
been
hailed
from
the
other
side
made
its
way
across
beatrice
is
like
one
of
my
own
daughters
he
said
and
i
can
not
give
her
better
praise
than
that
she
is
always
here
and
always
as
you
saw
her
today
i
think
she
is
one
of
the
strongest
spirits
i
know
what
did
you
think
of
her
mr
torridon
she
did
not
talk
much
said
ralph
she
talks
when
she
has
aught
to
say
went
on
more
and
otherwise
is
silent
it
is
a
good
rule
sir
i
would
i
observed
it
myself
who
is
she
asked
ralph
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
friend
i
had
and
she
lives
just
now
with
my
wife
sisters
nan
and
fan
she
is
often
in
town
with
one
of
them
i
am
astonished
you
have
not
met
her
before
the
wherry
slid
up
to
the
steps
and
the
man
in
his
great
boots
slipped
over
the
side
to
steady
it
now
is
the
time
to
begin
your
philosophy
said
more
as
ralph
stepped
in
and
a
socrates
is
ready
talk
it
over
mr
torridon
chapter
vi
ralph
intercession
ralph
was
astonished
to
find
how
the
thought
of
the
tall
girl
he
had
met
at
sir
thomas
more
house
remained
with
him
he
had
reported
the
result
of
his
interview
with
more
himself
to
his
master
and
cromwell
had
received
it
rather
coldly
he
had
sniffed
once
or
twice
that
was
not
very
well
done
torridon
i
fear
that
you
have
frightened
him
and
gained
nothing
by
it
ralph
stood
silent
but
i
see
you
make
no
excuses
went
on
cromwell
so
i
will
make
them
for
you
i
daresay
he
was
frightened
already
and
knew
all
about
what
had
passed
between
her
and
the
archbishop
you
must
try
again
sir
ralph
felt
his
heart
stir
with
pleasure
i
may
say
i
have
made
friends
with
more
sir
he
said
i
had
good
fortune
in
the
matter
of
a
quotation
and
he
received
me
kindly
i
can
go
there
again
without
excusing
my
presence
as
often
as
you
will
cromwell
looked
at
him
there
is
not
much
to
be
gained
now
he
said
but
you
can
go
if
you
will
and
you
may
perhaps
pick
up
something
here
and
there
the
more
friends
you
make
the
better
ralph
went
away
delighted
he
had
not
wholly
failed
then
in
his
business
and
he
seemed
to
have
set
on
foot
a
business
of
his
own
and
he
contemplated
with
some
excitement
his
future
visits
to
chelsea
he
had
his
first
word
with
the
king
a
couple
of
months
later
he
had
often
of
course
seen
him
before
once
or
twice
in
the
house
of
lords
formidable
and
frowning
on
his
throne
his
gross
chin
on
his
hand
barking
out
a
word
or
two
to
his
subjects
or
instructing
them
in
theology
for
which
indeed
he
was
very
competent
and
several
times
in
processions
riding
among
his
gentlemen
on
his
great
horse
splendid
in
velvet
and
gems
and
he
had
always
wondered
what
it
was
that
gave
him
his
power
it
could
not
be
mere
despotism
he
thought
or
his
burly
english
nature
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
seen
him
near
at
hand
and
come
within
range
of
his
personality
that
he
understood
why
it
was
that
men
bore
such
things
from
him
he
was
sent
for
one
afternoon
by
cromwell
to
bring
a
paper
and
was
taken
up
at
once
by
a
servant
into
the
gallery
where
the
minister
and
the
king
were
walking
together
they
were
at
the
further
end
from
that
at
which
he
entered
and
he
stood
a
little
nervous
at
his
heart
but
with
his
usual
appearance
of
watching
the
two
great
backs
turned
to
him
and
waiting
to
be
called
they
turned
again
in
a
moment
and
cromwell
saw
him
and
beckoned
himself
coming
a
few
steps
to
meet
him
the
king
waited
and
ralph
was
aware
of
rather
than
saw
that
wide
coarse
strong
face
and
the
long
narrow
eyes
with
the
feathered
cap
atop
and
the
rich
jewelled
dress
beneath
the
king
stood
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
his
legs
well
apart
cromwell
took
the
paper
from
ralph
who
stepped
back
hesitating
what
to
do
this
is
it
your
grace
said
the
minister
going
back
again
your
grace
will
see
that
it
is
as
i
said
ralph
perceived
a
new
tone
of
deference
in
his
master
voice
that
he
had
never
noticed
before
except
once
when
cromwell
was
ironically
bullying
a
culprit
who
was
giving
trouble
the
king
said
nothing
took
the
paper
and
glanced
over
it
standing
a
little
aside
to
let
the
light
fall
on
it
your
grace
will
understand
began
cromwell
again
yes
yes
yes
said
the
harsh
voice
impatiently
let
the
fellow
take
it
back
and
he
thrust
the
paper
into
cromwell
hand
who
turned
once
more
to
ralph
who
is
he
said
the
king
i
have
seen
his
face
who
are
you
this
is
ralph
torridon
said
cromwell
a
very
useful
friend
to
me
your
grace
the
torridons
of
overfield
questioned
henry
once
more
who
never
forgot
a
face
or
a
name
yes
your
grace
said
cromwell
you
are
tall
enough
sir
said
the
king
running
his
narrow
eyes
up
and
down
ralph
figure
a
strong
friend
i
hope
so
your
grace
said
ralph
the
king
again
looked
at
him
and
ralph
dropped
his
eyes
in
the
glare
of
that
mighty
personality
then
henry
abruptly
thrust
out
his
hand
to
be
kissed
and
as
ralph
bent
over
it
he
was
aware
of
the
thick
straight
fingers
the
creased
wrist
and
the
growth
of
hair
on
the
back
of
the
hand
ralph
was
astonished
and
a
little
ashamed
at
his
own
excitement
as
he
passed
down
the
stairs
again
it
was
so
little
that
had
happened
his
own
part
had
been
so
insignificant
and
yet
he
was
tingling
from
head
to
foot
he
felt
he
knew
now
a
little
better
how
it
was
that
the
will
however
outrageous
in
its
purposes
was
done
so
quickly
it
was
the
sheer
natural
genius
of
authority
and
royalty
that
forced
it
through
he
had
felt
himself
dominated
and
subdued
in
those
few
moments
so
that
he
was
not
his
own
master
as
he
went
home
through
the
street
or
two
that
separated
the
palace
gate
from
his
own
house
he
found
himself
analysing
the
effect
of
that
presence
and
in
spite
of
its
repellence
its
suggestion
of
coarseness
and
its
almost
irritating
imperiousness
he
was
conscious
that
there
was
a
very
strong
element
of
attractiveness
in
it
too
it
seemed
to
him
the
kind
of
attractiveness
that
there
is
for
a
beaten
dog
in
the
chastising
hand
the
personality
was
so
overwhelming
that
it
compelled
allegiance
and
that
not
wholly
one
of
fear
he
found
himself
thinking
of
queen
katharine
and
understanding
a
little
better
how
it
was
that
the
refined
delicately
nurtured
and
devout
woman
so
constant
in
her
prayers
so
full
of
the
peculiar
fineness
of
character
that
gentle
birth
and
religion
alone
confer
could
so
cling
to
this
fierce
lord
of
hers
throw
herself
at
his
feet
with
tears
before
all
the
company
and
entreat
not
to
be
separated
from
him
calling
him
her
dear
lord
her
love
and
her
most
merciful
and
gracious
prince
the
transition
from
this
train
of
thought
to
that
bearing
on
beatrice
was
not
a
difficult
one
for
the
memory
of
the
girl
was
continually
in
his
mind
he
had
seen
her
half
a
dozen
times
now
since
their
first
meeting
for
he
had
availed
himself
to
the
full
of
encouragement
to
make
himself
at
home
at
chelsea
and
he
found
that
his
interest
in
her
deepened
every
time
with
a
touch
of
amusement
he
found
himself
studying
horace
and
terence
again
not
only
for
sir
thomas
more
benefit
but
in
order
to
win
his
approval
and
his
good
report
to
his
household
among
whom
beatrice
was
practically
to
be
reckoned
he
was
pleased
too
by
more
account
of
beatrice
she
is
nearly
as
good
a
scholar
as
my
dear
meg
he
had
said
one
day
try
her
mr
torridon
ralph
had
carefully
prepared
an
apt
quotation
that
day
and
fired
it
off
presently
not
at
beatrice
but
as
it
were
across
her
but
there
was
not
the
faintest
response
or
the
quiver
of
an
eyelid
there
was
silence
a
moment
and
then
sir
thomas
burst
out
you
need
not
look
so
demure
my
child
we
all
know
that
you
understand
beatrice
had
given
him
a
look
of
tranquil
amusement
in
return
i
will
not
be
made
a
show
of
she
said
ralph
went
away
that
day
more
engrossed
than
ever
he
began
to
ask
himself
where
his
interest
in
her
would
end
and
wondered
at
its
intensity
as
he
questioned
himself
about
it
it
seemed
that
to
him
it
was
to
a
great
extent
her
appearance
of
detached
that
attracted
him
it
was
the
quality
that
he
most
desired
for
himself
and
one
which
he
had
in
measure
attained
but
he
was
aware
that
in
the
presence
of
cromwell
at
least
it
deserted
him
he
knew
well
that
he
had
found
his
master
there
and
that
he
himself
was
nothing
more
than
a
before
a
shrine
but
it
provoked
him
to
feel
that
there
was
no
one
who
seemed
to
occupy
the
place
of
a
similar
divinity
with
regard
to
this
girl
obviously
she
admired
and
loved
sir
thomas
more
ralph
soon
found
out
how
deeply
in
the
course
of
his
visits
but
she
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
her
friend
she
serenely
contradicted
him
when
she
disagreed
with
what
he
said
would
fail
to
keep
her
appointments
at
his
house
with
the
same
equanimity
and
in
spite
of
sir
thomas
personality
never
appeared
to
give
him
more
than
a
friendly
and
affectionate
homage
with
regard
to
ralph
himself
it
was
the
same
she
was
not
in
the
least
awed
by
him
or
apparently
impressed
by
his
reputation
which
at
this
time
was
growing
rapidly
as
that
of
a
capable
and
daring
agent
of
cromwell
and
even
once
or
twice
when
he
condescended
to
hint
at
the
vastness
of
the
affairs
on
which
he
was
engaged
in
a
desperate
endeavour
to
rouse
her
admiration
she
only
looked
at
him
steadily
a
moment
with
very
penetrating
eyes
and
began
to
speak
of
something
else
he
began
to
feel
discouraged
the
first
hint
that
ralph
had
that
he
had
been
making
a
mistake
in
his
estimate
of
her
came
from
margaret
roper
who
was
still
living
at
chelsea
with
her
husband
will
ralph
had
walked
up
to
the
house
one
bleak
afternoon
in
early
spring
along
the
from
westminster
and
had
found
margaret
alone
in
the
seated
by
the
window
with
her
embroidery
in
her
hand
and
a
terence
propped
open
on
the
sill
to
catch
the
last
gleams
of
light
from
the
darkening
afternoon
she
greeted
ralph
warmly
for
he
was
a
very
familiar
figure
to
them
all
by
now
and
soon
began
to
talk
when
he
had
taken
a
seat
by
the
wide
open
fireplace
whence
the
flames
flickered
out
casting
shadows
and
lights
round
the
high
room
across
the
tapestries
and
in
the
gloomy
corners
beatrice
is
here
she
said
presently
upstairs
with
father
i
think
she
is
doing
some
copying
for
him
she
is
a
great
deal
with
him
observed
ralph
why
yes
father
thinks
so
much
of
her
he
says
that
none
can
write
so
well
as
she
or
has
such
a
quick
brain
and
then
she
does
not
talk
he
says
nor
ask
foolish
like
the
rest
of
us
and
margaret
glanced
up
a
moment
smiling
i
suppose
i
must
not
go
up
said
ralph
a
little
peevishly
for
he
was
tired
with
his
long
day
why
no
you
must
not
said
margaret
but
she
will
be
down
soon
mr
torridon
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
margaret
spoke
again
torridon
she
said
may
i
say
something
ralph
made
a
little
sound
of
assent
the
warmth
of
the
fire
was
making
him
sleepy
well
it
is
this
said
margaret
slowly
i
think
you
believe
that
beatrice
does
not
like
you
that
is
not
true
she
is
very
fond
of
you
she
thinks
a
great
deal
of
you
she
added
rather
hastily
ralph
sat
up
his
drowsiness
was
gone
how
do
you
know
that
mrs
roper
he
asked
his
voice
sounded
perfectly
natural
and
margaret
was
reassured
at
the
tone
of
it
she
could
not
see
ralph
well
it
was
getting
dark
now
i
know
it
well
she
said
of
course
we
talk
of
you
when
you
are
gone
and
does
beatrice
talk
of
me
not
so
much
said
margaret
but
she
listens
very
closely
and
asks
us
questions
sometimes
the
girl
heart
was
beating
with
excitement
as
she
spoke
but
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
seek
this
opportunity
it
seemed
a
pity
she
thought
that
two
friends
of
hers
should
so
misunderstood
one
another
and
what
kind
of
questions
asked
ralph
again
she
wonders
what
you
really
think
went
on
margaret
slowly
bending
down
over
her
embroidery
and
punctuating
her
words
with
stitches
about
about
affairs
and
and
she
said
one
day
that
well
said
ralph
in
the
same
tone
that
she
thought
you
were
not
so
severe
as
you
seemed
ended
margaret
her
voice
a
little
tremulous
with
amusement
ralph
sat
perfectly
still
staring
at
the
great
on
which
a
smoky
phoebus
in
relief
drove
the
chariot
of
the
sun
behind
the
tall
wavering
flames
that
rose
from
the
burning
logs
he
knew
very
well
why
margaret
had
spoken
and
that
she
would
not
speak
without
reason
but
the
fact
revealed
was
so
bewilderingly
new
to
him
that
he
could
not
take
it
in
margaret
looked
at
him
once
or
twice
a
little
uneasily
and
at
last
sighed
it
is
too
dark
she
said
i
must
fetch
candles
she
slipped
out
of
the
that
led
to
the
servants
quarters
and
ralph
was
left
alone
all
his
weariness
was
gone
now
the
whirl
of
images
and
schemes
with
which
his
brain
had
been
seething
as
he
walked
up
the
before
had
receded
into
obscurity
and
one
dominating
thought
filled
their
place
what
if
margaret
were
right
and
what
did
he
mean
to
do
himself
surely
he
was
not
the
door
from
the
entrance
passage
opened
and
a
tall
slender
figure
stood
there
now
in
light
now
in
shadow
as
the
flames
rose
and
fell
meg
said
a
voice
ralph
sat
still
a
moment
longer
meg
said
beatrice
again
how
dark
you
are
ralph
stood
up
mrs
roper
has
just
gone
he
said
you
must
put
up
with
me
mrs
beatrice
who
is
it
said
the
girl
advancing
mr
torridon
she
had
a
paper
in
her
hand
as
she
came
across
the
floor
and
ralph
drew
out
a
chair
for
her
on
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
yes
he
said
roper
has
gone
for
lights
she
will
be
back
immediately
beatrice
sat
down
it
is
a
troublesome
word
she
said
master
more
can
not
read
it
himself
and
has
sent
me
to
ask
meg
he
says
that
every
dutiful
daughter
should
be
able
to
read
her
father
hand
and
ralph
could
see
a
faint
amused
smile
in
her
black
eyes
as
the
firelight
shone
on
them
master
more
always
has
an
escape
ready
he
said
as
he
too
sat
down
the
girl
hand
holding
the
paper
suddenly
dropped
on
to
her
knee
and
the
man
saw
she
was
looking
at
him
oddly
yes
he
said
interrogatively
and
then
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
mrs
beatrice
it
is
what
you
said
do
you
really
think
that
mr
torridon
ralph
was
bewildered
for
a
moment
i
do
not
understand
he
said
do
you
truly
think
he
always
has
an
escape
ready
repeated
the
girl
then
ralph
understood
you
mean
he
is
in
danger
he
said
steadily
well
of
course
he
is
there
is
no
great
man
that
is
not
but
i
do
not
see
why
he
should
not
escape
as
he
has
always
done
you
think
that
mr
torridon
why
yes
went
on
ralph
a
little
hastily
you
remember
the
matter
of
the
bribe
see
how
he
cleared
himself
surely
beatrice
and
you
really
think
so
said
the
girl
i
know
that
you
know
what
we
do
not
and
i
shall
believe
what
you
say
how
can
i
tell
remonstrated
ralph
i
can
only
tell
you
that
in
this
matter
i
know
nothing
that
you
do
not
master
more
is
under
no
suspicion
beatrice
drew
a
breath
of
relief
i
am
glad
i
spoke
to
you
sir
she
said
it
has
been
on
my
mind
and
something
that
he
said
a
few
minutes
ago
frightened
me
what
did
he
say
asked
ralph
curiously
ah
it
was
not
much
it
was
that
no
man
knew
what
might
come
next
that
matters
were
very
strange
and
dismaying
and
and
that
he
wanted
this
paper
copied
quickly
for
fear
the
girl
stopped
again
abruptly
i
know
what
you
feel
beatrice
said
ralph
gently
i
know
how
you
love
master
more
and
how
terrified
we
may
become
for
our
friends
what
do
you
think
yourself
torridon
she
said
suddenly
almost
interrupting
him
he
looked
at
her
doubtfully
a
moment
and
half
wished
that
margaret
would
come
back
that
is
a
wide
question
he
said
well
you
know
what
i
mean
she
said
coolly
completely
herself
again
she
was
sitting
back
in
her
chair
now
drawing
the
paper
serenely
to
and
fro
between
her
fingers
and
he
could
see
the
firelight
on
her
chin
and
brows
and
those
steady
eyes
watching
him
he
had
an
impulse
of
confidence
i
do
think
changes
are
coming
he
said
i
suppose
we
all
do
and
you
approve
oh
how
can
i
say
but
i
think
changes
are
needed
she
was
looking
down
at
the
fire
again
now
and
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
master
more
said
you
were
of
the
new
school
she
said
meditatively
ralph
felt
a
curious
thrill
of
exultation
margaret
was
right
then
this
girl
had
been
thinking
about
him
there
is
certainly
a
stirring
he
said
and
his
voice
was
a
little
restrained
oh
i
am
not
blind
or
deaf
said
the
girl
of
course
there
is
a
stirring
but
i
wondered
then
margaret
came
in
with
the
candles
ralph
went
away
that
evening
more
excited
than
he
liked
it
seemed
as
if
mistress
roper
words
had
set
light
to
a
fire
ready
laid
and
he
could
perceive
the
warmth
beginning
to
move
about
his
heart
and
odd
wavering
lights
flickering
on
his
circumstances
and
business
that
had
not
been
there
before
he
received
his
first
letter
from
beatrice
a
few
weeks
later
and
it
threw
him
into
a
strait
between
his
personal
and
official
claims
cromwell
at
this
time
was
exceedingly
occupied
with
quelling
the
ardour
of
the
house
of
lords
who
were
requesting
that
the
holy
maid
of
kent
and
her
companions
might
have
an
opportunity
of
defending
themselves
before
the
act
of
attainder
ordered
by
the
king
was
passed
against
them
but
he
found
time
to
tell
his
agent
that
trouble
was
impending
over
more
and
fisher
and
to
request
him
to
hand
in
any
evidence
that
he
might
have
against
the
former
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
let
the
bishop
off
with
a
fine
said
the
minister
in
regard
to
the
maid
affair
but
we
shall
catch
him
presently
over
the
act
and
more
is
clear
of
it
but
we
shall
have
him
too
in
a
few
days
put
down
what
you
have
to
say
torridon
and
let
me
have
it
this
evening
and
then
he
rustled
off
down
the
staircase
to
where
his
carriage
was
waiting
to
take
him
to
westminster
where
he
proposed
to
tell
the
scrupulous
peers
that
the
king
was
not
accustomed
to
command
twice
and
that
to
suspect
his
grace
of
wishing
them
to
do
an
injustice
was
a
piece
of
insolence
that
neither
himself
nor
his
royal
master
had
expected
of
them
ralph
was
actually
engaged
in
putting
down
his
very
scanty
accusations
against
sir
thomas
more
when
the
letter
from
beatrice
was
brought
up
to
him
he
read
it
through
twice
in
silence
and
then
ordered
the
courier
to
wait
below
when
the
servant
had
left
the
room
he
read
it
through
a
third
time
it
was
not
long
but
it
was
pregnant
i
entreat
you
sir
wrote
the
girl
for
the
love
of
jesu
to
let
us
know
if
anything
is
designed
against
our
friend
three
weeks
ago
you
told
me
it
was
not
so
i
pray
god
that
may
be
true
still
i
know
that
you
would
not
lift
a
finger
against
him
yourself
ralph
glanced
at
his
own
neat
little
list
at
these
words
and
bit
his
pen
but
i
wish
you
to
do
what
you
can
for
him
and
for
us
all
then
followed
an
erasure
ralph
carried
the
paper
to
the
window
flattened
it
against
the
panes
and
read
clearly
the
words
if
my
under
the
scratching
lines
and
smiled
to
himself
as
he
guessed
what
the
sentence
was
that
she
was
beginning
then
the
letter
continued
i
hear
on
good
authority
that
there
is
something
against
him
he
will
not
escape
and
will
do
nothing
on
such
hearsay
but
only
tells
us
to
trust
god
and
laughs
at
us
all
good
torridon
do
what
you
can
your
loving
friend
ralph
went
back
from
the
window
where
he
was
still
standing
and
sat
down
again
bending
his
head
into
his
hands
he
had
no
sort
of
scruples
against
lying
as
such
or
betraying
more
private
conversation
his
whole
training
was
directed
against
such
foolishness
and
he
had
learnt
at
last
from
cromwell
incessant
precept
and
example
that
the
good
of
the
state
all
private
interests
but
he
had
a
disinclination
to
lie
to
beatrice
and
he
felt
simply
unable
to
lose
her
friendship
by
telling
her
the
truth
as
he
sat
there
perfectly
still
the
servant
peeped
in
once
softly
to
see
if
the
answer
was
ready
and
noiselessly
withdrew
ralph
did
not
stir
but
still
sat
on
pressing
his
eyeballs
till
they
ached
and
fiery
rings
twisted
before
him
in
the
darkness
then
he
abruptly
sat
up
blinked
a
moment
or
two
took
up
a
pen
bit
it
again
and
laid
it
down
and
sat
eyeing
the
two
papers
that
lay
side
by
side
on
his
desk
he
took
up
his
own
list
and
read
it
through
after
all
it
was
very
insignificant
and
contained
no
more
than
minute
scraps
of
conversation
that
sir
thomas
more
had
let
drop
he
had
called
queen
katharine
poor
woman
three
or
four
times
had
expressed
a
reverence
for
the
pope
of
rome
half
a
dozen
times
and
had
once
called
him
the
vicar
of
christ
he
had
been
silent
when
someone
had
mentioned
anne
boleyn
name
he
had
praised
the
carthusians
and
the
religious
life
generally
at
some
length
they
were
the
kind
of
remarks
that
might
mean
nothing
or
a
great
deal
they
were
consistent
with
loyalty
they
were
not
inconsistent
with
treason
in
fact
they
were
exactly
the
kind
of
material
out
of
which
serious
accusations
might
be
manufactured
by
a
skilled
hand
though
as
they
stood
they
proved
nothing
a
further
consideration
to
ralph
was
his
duty
to
cromwell
he
scarcely
felt
it
seemly
to
lie
to
him
and
on
the
other
hand
he
felt
now
simply
unable
to
lie
to
beatrice
there
was
only
one
way
out
of
it
to
prevaricate
to
them
both
he
took
up
his
own
paper
glanced
at
it
once
more
and
then
with
a
slightly
dramatic
gesture
tore
it
across
and
across
and
threw
it
on
the
ground
then
he
took
up
his
pen
and
wrote
to
beatrice
i
have
only
had
access
to
one
paper
against
our
friend
that
i
have
destroyed
though
i
do
not
know
what
master
cromwell
will
say
but
i
tell
you
this
to
show
at
what
a
price
i
value
your
friendship
of
course
our
friend
is
threatened
who
is
not
in
these
days
but
i
swear
to
you
that
i
do
not
know
what
is
the
design
he
added
a
word
or
two
more
for
politeness
sake
prayed
that
god
might
have
her
in
his
keeping
and
signed
himself
as
she
had
done
her
loving
friend
then
he
dried
the
ink
with
his
pounce
box
sealed
the
letter
with
great
care
and
took
it
down
to
the
courier
himself
he
faced
cromwell
in
the
evening
with
a
good
deal
of
terror
but
with
great
adroitness
swore
positively
that
more
had
said
nothing
actually
treasonable
and
had
found
on
putting
pen
to
paper
that
the
accusations
were
flimsier
than
he
thought
but
it
is
your
business
to
see
that
they
be
not
so
stormed
his
master
ralph
paused
a
moment
respectfully
i
can
not
make
a
purse
out
of
a
sow
ear
sir
i
must
have
at
least
some
sort
of
silk
when
cromwell
had
ceased
to
walk
up
and
down
ralph
pointed
out
with
considerable
shrewdness
that
he
did
not
suppose
that
his
evidence
was
going
to
form
the
main
ground
of
the
attack
on
more
and
that
it
would
merely
weaken
the
position
to
bring
such
feeble
arguments
to
bear
why
he
would
tear
them
to
shreds
sir
in
five
minutes
he
would
make
out
that
they
were
our
principal
grounds
he
is
a
skilled
lawyer
if
i
may
dare
to
say
so
master
cromwell
let
your
words
against
more
be
few
and
choice
this
was
bolder
speaking
than
he
had
ever
ventured
on
before
but
cromwell
was
in
a
good
humour
the
peers
had
proved
tractable
and
had
agreed
to
pass
the
attainder
against
elizabeth
barton
without
any
more
talk
of
justice
and
the
accused
right
of
defence
and
he
looked
now
at
ralph
with
a
grim
approval
i
believe
you
are
right
torridon
i
will
think
over
it
a
week
later
the
blow
fell
cromwell
looked
up
at
him
one
sunday
evening
as
he
came
into
the
room
with
his
papers
and
without
any
greeting
spoke
at
once
i
wish
you
to
go
to
lambeth
house
morning
early
torridon
master
more
is
to
be
there
to
have
the
oath
of
succession
tendered
to
him
with
the
others
do
your
best
to
persuade
him
to
take
it
be
his
true
friend
a
little
grim
amusement
shone
in
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
ralph
looked
at
him
a
moment
i
mean
it
torridon
do
your
best
i
wish
him
to
think
you
his
friend
as
ralph
went
across
the
thames
in
a
wherry
the
following
morning
he
was
still
thinking
out
the
situation
apparently
cromwell
wished
to
keep
in
friendly
touch
with
more
and
this
now
of
course
was
only
possible
through
ralph
and
would
have
been
impossible
if
the
latter
evidence
had
been
used
or
were
going
to
be
used
it
was
a
relief
to
him
to
know
that
the
consummation
of
his
treachery
was
postponed
at
least
for
the
present
but
he
would
not
have
called
it
treachery
as
lambeth
towers
began
to
loom
ahead
ralph
took
out
beatrice
letter
that
had
come
in
answer
to
his
own
a
few
days
before
and
ran
his
eyes
over
it
it
was
a
line
of
passionate
thanks
and
blessing
surely
he
had
reached
her
hidden
heart
at
last
he
put
the
letter
back
in
his
inner
pocket
just
before
he
stepped
ashore
it
no
doubt
would
be
a
useful
evidence
of
his
own
sincerity
in
his
interview
with
more
there
was
a
great
crowd
in
the
court
as
he
passed
through
for
many
were
being
called
to
take
the
oath
which
however
was
not
made
strictly
legal
until
the
following
second
act
in
the
autumn
several
carriages
were
drawn
up
near
the
house
door
and
among
them
ralph
recognised
the
liveries
of
his
master
and
of
lord
chancellor
audley
a
number
of
horses
and
mules
too
were
tethered
to
rings
in
the
wall
on
the
other
side
with
grooms
beside
them
and
ecclesiastics
and
secretaries
were
coming
and
going
disputing
in
groups
calling
to
one
another
in
the
pleasant
april
sunshine
on
enquiry
he
found
that
the
commissioners
were
sitting
in
one
of
the
downstair
parlours
but
one
of
cromwell
servants
at
the
door
told
him
that
he
was
not
to
go
in
there
but
that
more
was
upstairs
by
himself
and
that
if
he
pleased
he
would
show
him
the
way
it
was
an
old
room
looking
on
to
the
garden
scantily
furnished
with
a
patch
of
carpet
by
the
window
and
a
table
and
chair
set
upon
it
more
turned
round
from
the
on
which
he
was
kneeling
to
look
out
and
smiled
genially
as
ralph
heard
the
servant
close
the
door
why
torridon
are
you
in
trouble
too
this
is
the
whither
i
am
sent
to
consider
myself
he
led
ralph
still
holding
his
hand
to
the
where
he
leaned
again
looking
eagerly
into
the
garden
there
go
the
good
boys
he
said
to
and
fro
in
the
playground
and
here
sit
i
suppose
i
have
nothing
but
the
rod
to
look
for
ralph
felt
a
little
awkward
in
the
presence
of
this
gaiety
and
for
a
minute
or
two
leaned
out
beside
more
staring
mechanically
at
the
figures
that
passed
up
and
down
he
had
expected
almost
to
find
him
at
his
prayers
or
at
least
thoughtfully
considering
himself
more
commented
agreeably
on
the
wilson
was
here
a
moment
ago
but
he
is
off
now
with
a
man
on
either
side
he
too
is
a
naughty
fellow
like
myself
and
will
not
listen
to
reason
there
is
the
vicar
of
croydon
good
man
coming
out
of
the
buttery
wiping
his
mouth
ralph
looked
down
at
the
priest
flushed
excited
face
he
was
talking
with
a
kind
of
reckless
gaiety
to
a
friend
who
walked
beside
him
he
was
sad
enough
just
now
went
on
the
other
while
he
was
still
obstinate
but
his
master
hath
patted
him
on
the
head
now
and
given
him
cake
and
wine
he
was
calling
out
for
a
drink
just
now
which
he
hath
got
i
see
either
for
gladness
or
for
dryness
or
else
that
we
might
know
ille
notus
erat
latimer
passed
presently
his
arms
on
either
side
flung
round
a
priest
neck
he
too
was
talking
volubly
and
laughing
and
the
skirts
of
his
habit
wagged
behind
him
he
is
in
high
feather
said
more
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
his
conscience
is
as
clear
as
his
eyes
come
torridon
sit
you
down
what
have
you
come
for
ralph
sat
back
on
the
with
his
back
to
the
light
and
his
hat
between
his
knees
i
came
to
see
you
sir
i
have
not
been
to
the
commissioners
i
heard
you
were
here
why
yes
said
more
here
i
am
i
came
to
see
if
i
could
be
of
any
use
to
you
master
more
i
know
a
friend
face
is
a
good
councillor
sometimes
even
though
that
friend
be
a
fool
more
patted
him
softly
on
the
knee
no
fool
he
said
far
from
it
he
looked
at
him
so
oddly
that
ralph
feared
that
he
suspected
him
so
he
made
haste
to
bring
out
beatrice
letter
mistress
atherton
has
written
me
this
he
said
i
was
able
to
do
her
a
little
service
at
least
i
thought
it
so
then
more
took
the
letter
and
glanced
at
it
a
very
pretty
letter
he
said
and
why
do
you
show
it
me
ralph
looked
at
him
steadily
because
i
am
master
cromwell
servant
and
you
never
forget
it
more
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
and
then
took
ralph
kindly
by
the
hand
you
are
either
very
innocent
or
very
deep
he
said
and
what
have
you
come
to
ask
me
i
have
come
to
ask
nothing
master
more
said
ralph
indignantly
withdrawing
his
hand
except
to
be
of
service
to
you
to
talk
about
the
oath
corrected
the
other
placidly
very
well
then
do
you
begin
mr
torridon
ralph
made
a
great
effort
for
he
was
sorely
perplexed
by
sir
attitude
and
began
to
talk
putting
all
the
reasons
forward
that
he
could
think
of
for
the
accepting
of
the
oath
he
pointed
out
that
government
and
allegiance
would
be
impossible
things
if
every
man
had
to
examine
for
himself
the
claims
of
his
rulers
when
vexed
and
elaborate
questions
arose
and
this
certainly
was
one
such
was
it
not
safer
to
follow
the
decrees
of
the
king
and
parliament
rather
than
to
take
up
a
position
of
private
judgment
and
decide
upon
details
of
which
a
subject
could
have
no
knowledge
how
too
could
more
under
the
circumstances
take
upon
himself
to
condemn
those
who
had
subscribed
the
oath
he
named
a
few
eminent
prelates
the
abbot
of
westminster
and
others
i
do
not
condemn
them
put
in
more
who
was
looking
interested
then
you
are
uncertain
of
the
matter
went
on
ralph
who
had
thought
out
his
line
of
argument
with
some
care
more
assented
but
your
duty
to
the
king
grace
is
certain
therefore
it
should
outweigh
a
thing
that
is
doubtful
sir
thomas
sucked
in
his
lower
lip
and
stared
gravely
on
the
young
man
you
are
very
shrewd
sir
he
said
i
do
not
know
how
to
answer
that
at
this
moment
but
i
have
no
reasonable
doubt
but
that
there
is
an
answer
ralph
was
delighted
with
his
advantage
and
pursued
it
eagerly
and
after
a
few
minutes
had
won
from
more
an
acknowledgment
that
he
might
be
willing
to
consider
the
taking
of
the
oath
itself
it
was
the
other
clauses
that
touched
his
conscience
more
he
could
swear
to
be
loyal
to
anne
children
but
he
could
not
assent
to
the
denunciation
of
the
pope
contained
in
the
preamble
of
the
act
and
the
oath
would
commit
him
to
that
but
you
will
tell
that
to
the
commissioners
sir
asked
ralph
eagerly
i
will
tell
them
all
that
i
have
told
you
said
more
smiling
ralph
himself
was
somewhat
doubtful
as
to
whether
the
concession
would
be
accepted
but
he
professed
great
confidence
and
secretly
congratulated
himself
with
having
made
so
much
way
but
presently
a
remark
of
more
showed
that
he
appreciated
the
situation
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
torridon
for
coming
and
talking
to
me
and
i
shall
tell
my
wife
and
children
so
but
it
is
of
no
use
they
are
resolved
to
catch
me
first
there
was
the
bribe
then
the
matter
of
the
maid
then
this
and
if
i
took
a
hundred
oaths
they
would
find
one
more
that
i
could
not
without
losing
my
soul
and
that
indeed
i
do
not
propose
to
do
enim
proficit
homo
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
a
moment
later
and
a
servant
came
in
to
beg
more
to
come
downstairs
again
the
commissioners
were
ready
for
him
then
torridon
you
will
come
and
see
me
sometimes
even
if
not
at
chelsea
wherever
i
may
be
it
will
be
as
nigh
heaven
as
chelsea
ralph
went
down
with
him
and
parted
from
him
at
the
door
of
the
commissioner
room
and
later
a
message
was
sent
out
to
him
by
cromwell
that
he
need
wait
no
longer
more
had
refused
the
oath
and
had
been
handed
over
to
the
custody
of
the
abbot
of
westminster
chapter
vii
a
merry
prisoner
the
arrest
of
sir
thomas
more
and
bishop
fisher
and
their
committal
to
the
tower
a
few
days
later
caused
nothing
less
than
consternation
in
england
and
of
furious
indignation
on
the
continent
it
was
evident
that
greatness
would
save
no
man
the
best
hope
lay
in
obscurity
and
men
who
had
been
loud
in
now
grew
timorous
and
silent
ralph
was
now
in
the
thick
of
events
besides
his
connection
with
more
he
had
been
present
at
one
of
the
examinations
of
the
maid
of
kent
and
her
admirers
had
formed
one
of
the
congregation
at
paul
cross
when
the
confession
drawn
up
for
her
had
been
read
aloud
in
her
name
by
capon
who
from
the
pulpit
opposite
the
platform
where
the
penitents
were
set
preached
a
vigorous
sermon
against
credulity
and
superstition
ralph
had
read
the
confession
over
a
couple
of
days
before
in
room
and
had
suggested
a
few
verbal
alterations
and
he
had
been
finally
present
a
few
days
after
more
arrest
at
the
last
scene
of
the
drama
when
elizabeth
barton
with
six
priests
suffered
under
the
provisions
of
an
act
of
attainder
on
tyburn
gallows
all
these
events
were
indications
of
the
course
that
things
were
taking
in
regard
to
greater
matters
parliament
had
now
advanced
further
than
ever
in
the
direction
of
a
breach
with
rome
and
had
transferred
the
power
of
nomination
to
bishoprics
from
the
holy
see
to
the
crown
and
what
was
as
least
as
significant
had
dealt
in
a
similar
manner
with
the
authority
over
religious
houses
on
the
other
side
rome
had
declared
definitely
against
the
annulling
of
queen
katharine
marriage
and
to
this
the
king
had
retorted
by
turning
the
pulpits
against
the
pope
and
in
the
course
of
this
had
found
himself
compelled
to
deal
sharply
with
the
franciscans
who
were
at
the
same
time
the
most
popular
and
the
most
papal
of
all
preachers
in
the
following
out
of
this
policy
first
several
notable
friars
were
imprisoned
and
next
a
couple
of
subservient
religious
a
dominican
and
an
augustinian
were
appointed
grand
visitors
of
the
rebellious
order
a
cloud
of
terror
now
began
to
brood
over
the
religious
houses
in
england
as
the
news
of
these
proceedings
became
known
and
ralph
had
a
piteous
letter
from
his
father
entreating
him
to
give
some
explanation
of
the
course
of
affairs
so
far
as
was
compatible
with
loyalty
to
his
master
and
at
least
his
advice
as
to
christopher
profession
we
hear
sad
tales
dear
son
wrote
sir
james
on
all
sides
are
fears
and
no
man
knows
what
the
end
will
be
some
even
say
that
the
orders
will
be
reduced
in
number
and
who
knows
what
may
be
toward
now
that
the
bishop
and
more
are
in
trouble
i
know
not
what
is
all
this
that
parliament
has
been
doing
about
the
holy
father
his
authority
but
i
am
sure
that
it
can
not
be
more
than
what
other
reigns
have
brought
about
in
declaring
that
the
prince
is
temporal
lord
of
his
land
but
however
that
may
be
what
do
you
advise
that
your
brother
should
do
he
is
to
be
professed
in
august
unless
it
is
prevented
and
i
dare
not
put
out
my
hand
to
hinder
it
until
i
know
more
i
do
not
ask
you
dear
son
to
tell
me
what
you
should
not
i
know
my
duty
and
yours
too
well
for
that
but
i
entreat
you
to
tell
me
what
you
can
that
i
may
not
consent
to
your
brother
profession
if
it
is
better
that
it
should
not
take
place
until
affairs
are
quieter
your
mother
would
send
you
her
dear
love
i
know
if
she
knew
i
were
writing
but
she
is
in
her
chamber
and
the
messenger
must
go
with
this
jesu
have
you
in
his
blessed
keeping
ralph
wrote
back
that
he
knew
no
reason
against
profession
except
what
might
arise
from
the
exposure
of
the
holy
maid
on
whose
advice
he
had
gone
to
lewes
and
that
if
his
father
and
brother
were
satisfied
on
that
score
he
hoped
that
christopher
would
follow
god
leading
at
the
same
time
that
he
wrote
this
he
was
engaged
under
directions
in
sifting
the
evidence
offered
by
the
grand
visitors
to
show
that
the
friars
refused
to
accept
the
new
enactments
on
the
subject
of
the
papal
jurisdiction
on
the
other
hand
the
carthusians
in
london
had
proved
more
submissive
there
had
been
a
struggle
at
first
when
the
oath
of
the
succession
had
been
tendered
to
them
and
prior
houghton
with
the
procurator
humphrey
middlemore
had
been
committed
to
the
tower
the
oath
affirmed
the
nullity
of
queen
katharine
marriage
with
the
king
on
the
alleged
ground
of
her
consummated
marriage
with
henry
elder
brother
and
involved
though
the
carthusians
did
not
clearly
understand
it
so
at
the
time
a
rejection
of
the
pope
authority
as
connected
with
the
dispensation
for
katharine
union
with
henry
in
may
their
scruples
were
removed
by
the
efforts
of
some
who
had
influence
with
them
and
the
whole
community
took
the
oath
as
required
of
them
though
with
the
pathetic
addition
of
a
clause
that
they
only
submitted
so
far
as
it
was
lawful
for
them
so
to
do
this
actual
submission
to
mind
and
therefore
to
ralph
was
at
first
of
more
significance
than
was
the
uneasy
temper
of
the
community
as
reported
to
them
which
followed
their
compliance
but
as
the
autumn
drew
on
this
opinion
was
modified
it
was
in
connection
with
this
that
ralph
became
aware
for
the
first
time
of
what
was
finally
impending
with
regard
to
the
king
supremacy
over
the
church
he
had
been
sitting
in
cromwell
room
in
the
chancery
all
through
one
morning
working
at
the
evidence
that
was
flowing
in
from
all
sides
of
disaffection
to
henry
policy
sifting
out
worthless
and
frivolous
charges
from
serious
ones
every
day
a
flood
of
such
testimony
poured
in
from
the
spies
in
all
parts
of
the
country
relating
to
the
deepening
dissatisfaction
with
the
method
of
government
and
cromwell
as
the
king
adviser
came
in
for
much
abuse
every
kind
of
manifestation
of
this
was
reported
the
talk
in
the
and
at
gentlemen
tables
alike
words
dropped
in
the
or
over
a
game
of
cards
and
the
offenders
were
dealt
with
in
various
ways
some
by
a
sharp
rebuke
or
warning
others
by
a
sudden
visit
of
a
pursuivant
and
his
men
ralph
made
his
report
as
usual
at
the
end
of
the
morning
and
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
when
his
master
called
him
back
from
the
door
a
moment
he
said
i
have
something
to
say
sit
down
when
ralph
had
taken
the
chair
again
that
he
had
just
left
cromwell
took
up
a
pen
and
began
to
play
with
it
delicately
as
he
talked
you
will
have
noticed
he
began
how
hot
the
feeling
runs
in
the
country
and
i
am
sure
you
will
also
have
understood
why
it
is
so
it
is
not
so
much
what
has
happened
i
mean
in
the
matter
of
the
marriage
and
of
the
friars
but
what
folk
fear
is
going
to
happen
it
seems
to
the
people
that
security
is
disappearing
they
do
not
understand
that
their
best
security
lies
in
obedience
and
above
all
they
think
that
matters
are
dangerous
with
regard
to
the
church
they
know
now
that
the
pope
has
spoken
and
that
the
king
pays
no
heed
but
on
the
other
hand
waxes
more
bold
and
that
because
his
conscience
bids
him
remember
that
sir
when
you
have
to
do
with
his
highness
he
glanced
at
ralph
again
but
there
was
no
mockery
in
his
solemn
eyes
then
he
went
on
i
am
going
to
tell
you
torridon
that
these
folks
are
partly
right
and
that
his
grace
has
not
yet
done
all
that
he
intends
there
is
yet
one
more
step
to
take
and
that
is
to
declare
the
king
supreme
over
the
church
of
england
ralph
felt
those
strong
eyes
bent
upon
him
and
he
nodded
making
no
sign
of
approval
or
otherwise
this
is
no
new
thing
torridon
went
on
cromwell
after
a
silence
the
king
of
england
has
always
been
supreme
though
i
will
acknowledge
that
this
has
become
obscured
of
late
but
it
is
time
that
it
be
the
popes
have
waxed
presumptuous
and
have
laid
claim
to
titles
that
christ
never
gave
them
and
it
is
time
that
they
be
reminded
that
england
is
free
and
will
not
suffer
their
domination
as
for
the
unity
of
the
catholic
church
that
can
be
attended
to
later
on
and
on
firmer
ground
when
the
pope
has
been
taught
not
to
wax
so
proud
there
will
be
an
act
passed
by
parliament
presently
perhaps
next
year
to
do
this
business
and
then
we
shall
know
better
what
to
do
until
that
it
is
very
necessary
as
you
have
already
seen
to
keep
the
folks
quiet
and
not
to
suffer
any
contradiction
of
his
grace
rights
do
you
understand
me
mr
torridon
cromwell
laid
the
pen
clown
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
his
fingers
together
i
understand
sir
said
ralph
in
a
perfectly
even
tone
well
that
is
all
that
i
have
to
say
ended
his
master
still
watching
him
i
need
not
tell
you
how
necessary
secrecy
is
in
the
matter
ralph
was
considerably
startled
as
he
went
home
and
realized
better
what
it
was
that
he
had
heard
while
prudent
persons
were
already
trembling
at
the
king
effrontery
and
daring
in
the
past
henry
was
meditating
a
yet
further
step
he
began
to
see
now
that
the
instinct
of
the
country
was
as
always
sharper
than
that
of
the
individual
and
that
these
uneasy
strivings
everywhere
rose
from
a
very
definite
perception
of
danger
the
idea
of
the
king
supremacy
as
represented
by
cromwell
would
not
seem
to
be
a
very
startling
departure
similar
protests
of
freedom
had
been
made
in
previous
reigns
but
now
following
as
it
did
upon
overt
acts
of
disobedience
to
the
sovereign
pontiff
and
of
disregard
of
his
authority
in
matters
of
and
even
of
the
status
of
religious
houses
it
seemed
to
have
a
significance
that
previous
protests
had
lacked
and
behind
it
all
was
the
king
conscience
this
was
a
new
thought
to
ralph
but
the
more
he
considered
it
the
more
it
convinced
him
it
was
a
curious
conscience
but
a
mighty
one
and
it
was
backed
by
an
indomitable
will
for
the
first
time
there
opened
out
to
ralph
mind
a
glimpse
of
the
possibility
that
he
had
scarcely
dreamed
of
hitherto
of
a
nationalism
in
church
affairs
that
was
a
reality
rather
than
a
theory
in
which
the
bishop
of
rome
while
yet
the
foremost
bishop
of
christendom
and
endowed
with
special
prerogatives
yet
should
have
no
finger
in
national
affairs
which
should
be
settled
by
the
home
authorities
without
reference
to
him
no
doubt
he
told
himself
a
readjustment
was
needed
visions
and
fancies
had
encrusted
themselves
so
quickly
round
the
religion
credible
by
a
practical
man
that
a
scouring
was
called
for
how
if
this
should
be
the
method
by
which
not
only
such
accretions
should
be
done
away
but
yet
more
practical
matters
should
be
arranged
and
steps
taken
to
amend
the
unwarranted
interferences
and
pecuniary
demands
of
this
foreign
bishop
he
had
had
more
than
one
interview
with
sir
thomas
more
in
the
tower
and
once
was
able
to
take
him
news
of
his
own
household
at
chelsea
for
a
month
none
of
his
own
people
except
his
servant
was
allowed
to
visit
him
and
ralph
calling
on
him
about
three
weeks
after
the
beginning
of
his
imprisonment
found
him
eager
for
news
he
was
in
a
sufficiently
pleasant
cell
in
the
beauchamp
tower
furnished
with
straw
mats
underfoot
and
straw
hangings
in
place
of
a
wainscot
his
bed
stood
in
one
corner
with
his
crucifix
and
beads
on
a
little
table
beside
it
and
his
narrow
window
looked
out
through
eleven
feet
of
wall
towards
the
court
and
the
white
tower
his
books
too
which
his
servant
john
wood
had
brought
from
chelsea
and
which
had
not
yet
been
taken
from
him
stood
about
the
room
and
several
lay
on
the
table
among
his
papers
at
which
he
was
writing
when
ralph
was
admitted
by
the
warder
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
torridon
he
said
i
knew
you
would
not
forget
an
old
friend
even
though
he
could
not
take
your
counsel
i
daresay
you
have
come
to
give
it
me
again
however
if
i
thought
you
would
take
it
began
ralph
but
i
will
not
said
more
smiling
no
more
than
before
sit
down
mr
torridon
ralph
had
come
at
cromwell
suggestion
and
with
a
very
great
willingness
of
his
own
too
he
knew
he
could
not
please
beatrice
more
than
by
visiting
her
friend
and
he
himself
was
pleased
and
amused
to
think
that
he
could
serve
his
master
interests
from
one
side
and
his
own
from
another
by
one
action
he
talked
a
little
about
the
oath
again
and
mentioned
how
many
had
taken
it
during
the
last
week
or
two
i
am
pleased
that
they
can
do
it
with
a
good
conscience
observed
more
and
now
let
us
talk
of
other
matters
if
i
would
not
do
it
for
my
daughter
sake
who
begged
me
i
would
not
do
it
for
the
sake
of
both
the
houses
of
parliament
nor
even
dear
torridon
for
yours
and
master
cromwell
ralph
saw
that
it
was
of
no
use
and
began
to
speak
of
other
things
he
gave
him
news
of
chelsea
they
are
not
very
merry
there
he
said
and
i
hardly
suppose
you
would
wish
them
to
be
why
not
cried
more
with
a
beaming
face
i
am
merry
enough
i
would
not
be
a
monk
so
god
hath
compelled
me
to
be
one
and
treats
me
as
one
of
his
own
spoilt
children
he
setteth
me
on
his
lap
and
dandleth
me
i
have
never
been
so
happy
he
told
ralph
presently
that
his
chief
sorrow
was
that
he
could
not
go
to
mass
or
receive
the
sacraments
the
lieutenant
sir
edward
walsingham
who
had
been
his
friend
had
told
him
that
he
would
very
gladly
have
given
him
liberties
of
this
kind
but
that
he
dared
not
for
fear
of
the
king
displeasure
but
i
told
him
said
more
not
to
trouble
himself
that
i
liked
his
cheer
well
enough
as
it
was
and
if
ever
i
did
not
he
was
to
put
me
out
of
his
doors
after
a
little
more
talk
he
showed
ralph
what
he
was
writing
it
was
a
treatise
called
a
dialogue
of
comfort
against
tribulation
it
is
to
persuade
myself
he
said
that
i
am
no
more
a
prisoner
than
i
was
before
i
know
i
am
but
sometimes
forget
it
we
are
all
prisoners
ralph
glanced
down
the
page
just
written
and
was
astonished
at
its
good
humour
some
prisoner
of
another
gaol
he
read
singeth
danceth
in
his
two
fetters
and
feareth
not
his
feet
for
stumbling
at
a
stone
while
prisoner
that
hath
but
his
one
foot
fettered
by
the
gout
lieth
groaning
on
a
couch
and
quaketh
and
crieth
out
if
he
fear
there
would
fall
on
his
foot
no
more
than
a
cushion
ralph
went
straight
up
the
river
from
the
tower
to
chelsea
to
take
them
news
of
the
prisoner
and
was
silent
and
moody
as
he
went
he
had
been
half
touched
and
half
enraged
by
more
bearing
touched
by
his
simplicity
and
cheerfulness
and
enraged
by
his
confidence
in
a
bad
cause
alice
more
behaved
as
usual
when
he
got
there
she
had
a
genius
for
the
obvious
commented
on
the
weariness
of
living
in
one
room
the
distress
at
the
thought
that
one
was
fastened
in
at
the
will
of
another
deplored
the
plainness
of
the
prison
fare
and
the
folly
of
her
husband
in
refusing
an
oath
that
she
herself
and
her
children
and
the
vast
majority
of
the
prominent
persons
in
england
had
found
so
simple
in
accepting
she
left
nothing
unsaid
finally
she
apologized
for
the
plainness
of
her
dress
you
must
think
me
a
slattern
torridon
but
i
can
not
help
it
i
have
not
the
heart
nor
the
means
now
that
my
man
is
in
prison
to
do
better
and
her
solemn
eyes
filled
with
tears
when
he
had
given
the
news
to
the
family
he
went
aside
from
the
group
in
the
garden
to
where
beatrice
atherton
was
sitting
below
the
jesu
tree
with
work
on
her
lap
he
had
noticed
as
he
talked
that
she
was
sitting
there
and
had
raised
his
voice
for
her
benefit
he
fancied
and
with
a
pleasure
at
the
delicate
instinct
that
she
did
not
wish
to
appear
as
intimately
interested
in
the
news
from
the
tower
as
those
who
had
a
better
right
to
be
he
was
always
detecting
now
faint
shades
in
her
character
as
he
knew
her
better
that
charmed
and
delighted
him
she
was
doing
some
mending
and
only
glanced
up
and
down
again
without
ceasing
or
moving
as
ralph
stood
by
her
i
thought
you
never
used
the
needle
he
began
in
a
moment
it
is
never
too
late
to
mend
she
said
without
the
faintest
movement
ralph
felt
again
an
odd
prick
of
happiness
it
gave
him
a
distinct
thrill
of
delight
that
she
would
make
such
an
answer
and
so
swiftly
and
at
such
a
time
when
tragedy
was
round
her
and
in
her
heart
for
he
knew
how
much
she
loved
the
man
from
whom
he
had
just
come
he
sat
down
on
the
garden
chair
opposite
and
watched
her
fingers
and
the
movements
of
her
wrist
as
she
passed
the
needle
in
and
out
and
neither
spoke
again
till
the
others
had
dispersed
you
heard
all
i
said
said
ralph
at
last
she
bowed
her
head
without
answering
shall
i
go
and
bring
you
news
again
presently
if
you
please
she
said
i
hope
to
be
able
to
do
some
little
things
for
him
went
on
ralph
dropping
his
eyes
and
he
was
conscious
that
she
momentarily
looked
up
but
i
am
afraid
there
is
not
much
i
shall
speak
for
him
to
master
cromwell
and
the
lieutenant
the
needle
paused
and
then
went
on
again
ralph
was
conscious
of
an
extraordinary
momentousness
in
every
word
that
he
said
he
was
well
aware
that
this
girl
was
not
to
be
wooed
by
violence
but
that
he
must
insinuate
his
mind
and
sympathies
delicately
with
hers
watching
for
every
movement
and
ripple
of
thought
he
had
known
ever
since
his
talk
with
margaret
roper
that
beatrice
was
as
it
were
turned
towards
him
and
scrutinising
him
and
that
any
mistake
on
his
part
however
slight
might
finally
alienate
her
even
his
gestures
the
tones
of
his
voice
his
manner
of
walking
were
important
elements
he
knew
now
that
he
was
the
kind
of
person
who
might
be
acceptable
to
her
or
rather
that
his
personality
contained
one
facet
that
pleased
her
and
that
he
must
be
careful
now
to
keep
that
facet
turned
towards
her
continually
at
such
an
angle
that
she
caught
the
flash
he
had
sufficient
sense
not
to
act
a
part
for
that
he
knew
she
would
soon
discover
but
to
be
natural
in
his
best
way
and
to
use
the
fine
instincts
that
he
was
aware
of
possessing
to
tell
him
exactly
how
she
would
wish
him
to
express
himself
it
would
be
a
long
time
yet
he
recognised
before
he
could
attain
his
final
object
in
fact
he
was
not
perfectly
certain
what
he
wanted
but
meanwhile
he
availed
himself
of
every
possible
opportunity
to
get
nearer
and
was
content
with
his
progress
he
was
sorely
tempted
now
to
discuss
sir
thomas
position
and
to
describe
his
own
but
he
perceived
from
her
own
aloofness
just
now
that
it
would
seem
a
profanity
so
he
preserved
silence
instead
knowing
that
it
would
be
eloquent
to
her
at
last
she
spoke
again
and
there
was
a
suggestion
of
a
tremor
in
her
voice
i
suppose
you
can
do
nothing
for
him
really
he
must
stay
in
the
tower
ralph
threw
out
his
hands
silently
expostulating
nothing
she
said
again
bending
over
her
work
ralph
stood
up
looking
down
at
her
but
made
no
answer
i
i
would
do
anything
she
said
deliberately
anything
i
think
for
the
man
and
then
broke
off
abruptly
ralph
went
away
from
chelsea
that
afternoon
with
a
whirling
head
and
dancing
heart
she
had
said
no
more
than
that
but
he
knew
what
she
had
meant
and
knew
too
that
she
would
not
have
said
as
much
to
anyone
to
whom
she
was
indifferent
of
course
it
was
hopeless
to
think
of
bringing
about
more
release
but
he
could
at
least
pretend
to
try
and
ralph
was
aware
that
to
chivalrous
souls
a
pathetic
failure
often
appeals
more
than
an
excellent
success
folks
turned
to
look
after
him
more
than
once
as
he
strode
home
chapter
viii
a
higher
step
as
chris
on
the
eve
of
his
profession
looked
back
over
the
year
that
had
passed
since
his
reception
at
the
he
scarcely
knew
whether
it
seemed
like
a
week
or
a
century
at
times
it
appeared
as
if
the
old
life
in
the
world
were
a
kind
of
picture
in
which
he
saw
himself
as
one
detached
from
his
present
personality
moving
among
curious
scenes
in
which
now
he
had
no
part
at
other
times
the
familiar
past
rushed
on
him
fiercely
deafened
him
with
its
appeal
and
claimed
him
as
its
own
in
such
moods
the
monastery
was
an
intolerable
prison
the
day
round
an
empty
formality
in
which
his
soul
was
being
stifled
and
even
his
habit
which
he
had
once
touched
so
reverently
the
badge
of
a
fool
the
life
of
the
world
at
such
times
seemed
to
him
the
only
sanity
these
men
used
the
powers
that
god
had
given
them
were
content
with
simple
and
unostentatious
doings
and
interests
reached
the
higher
vocation
by
their
very
naiveté
and
did
not
seek
to
fly
on
wings
that
were
not
meant
to
bear
them
how
sensible
christopher
told
himself
was
ralph
ideal
god
had
made
the
world
so
ralph
lived
in
it
a
world
in
which
great
and
small
affairs
were
carried
on
and
in
which
he
interested
himself
god
had
made
horses
and
hawks
had
provided
materials
for
carriages
and
fine
clothes
and
had
formed
the
sexes
and
allowed
for
love
and
domestic
matters
had
created
brains
with
their
capacities
of
passion
and
intellect
and
so
ralph
had
taken
these
things
as
he
found
them
hunted
dressed
lived
managed
and
mixed
with
men
at
times
in
his
cell
chris
saw
that
imposing
figure
in
all
its
quiet
bravery
of
dress
that
sane
clever
face
those
pitying
and
contemptuous
eyes
looking
at
him
and
heard
the
voice
asking
and
commenting
and
wondering
at
the
misguided
zeal
of
a
brother
who
could
give
all
this
up
and
seek
to
live
a
life
that
was
built
on
and
sustained
by
illusions
one
event
during
his
first
six
months
of
the
novitiate
helped
to
solemnise
him
and
to
clear
the
confusion
old
dom
augustine
was
taken
sick
and
died
and
chris
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
watched
the
melting
tragedy
of
death
the
old
monk
had
been
moved
from
the
dortor
to
the
when
the
end
seemed
imminent
and
one
afternoon
chris
noticed
the
little
table
set
outside
the
door
with
its
candles
and
crucifix
the
basin
of
and
the
other
signs
that
the
last
sacraments
were
to
be
administered
he
knew
little
of
the
old
man
except
his
bleared
face
and
shaking
hands
as
he
had
seen
them
in
choir
and
had
never
been
greatly
impressed
by
him
but
it
was
another
matter
when
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
at
his
order
he
passed
into
the
cell
and
knelt
down
with
the
others
to
see
the
end
the
old
monk
was
lying
now
on
the
cross
of
ashes
that
had
been
spread
on
the
floor
his
features
looked
pinched
and
white
in
the
candlelight
his
old
mouth
moved
incessantly
and
opened
now
and
again
to
gasp
but
there
was
an
august
dignity
on
his
face
that
chris
had
never
seen
there
before
outside
the
night
was
still
and
frosty
only
now
and
again
the
heavy
stroke
of
the
bell
told
the
town
that
a
soul
was
passing
dom
augustine
had
received
viaticum
an
hour
before
chris
had
heard
the
steady
tinkle
of
the
bell
like
the
sound
of
aaron
garments
as
the
priest
who
had
brought
him
communion
passed
back
with
his
sacred
burden
and
chris
had
fallen
on
his
knees
where
he
stood
as
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
white
procession
passing
back
to
the
church
their
frosty
breath
going
up
together
in
the
winter
night
air
the
wheeling
shadows
and
the
glare
of
the
torches
giving
a
pleasant
warm
light
in
the
dull
cloister
but
all
that
was
over
now
and
the
end
was
at
hand
as
chris
knelt
there
mechanically
responding
to
the
prayers
on
which
the
monk
soul
was
beginning
to
lift
itself
and
flutter
for
escape
there
fell
a
great
solemnity
on
his
spirit
the
thought
as
old
as
death
made
itself
real
to
him
that
this
was
the
end
of
every
man
and
of
himself
too
where
dom
augustine
lay
he
would
lie
with
his
past
behind
him
of
which
every
detail
would
be
instinct
with
eternal
import
all
the
tiny
things
of
the
monastic
life
the
rising
in
time
for
the
night
office
attention
during
it
the
responses
to
grace
the
little
movements
prescribed
by
etiquette
the
invisible
motions
of
a
soul
that
had
or
had
not
acted
for
the
love
of
god
those
stirrings
falls
aspirations
that
incessant
activity
of
eighty
years
all
so
incredibly
minute
from
one
point
of
view
so
incredibly
weighty
from
another
the
account
of
all
those
things
was
to
be
handed
in
now
and
an
eternal
judgment
given
he
looked
at
the
wearied
pained
old
face
again
at
the
eyes
the
jerking
movements
of
the
unshaven
lips
and
wondered
what
was
passing
behind
what
strange
colloquy
of
the
soul
with
itself
or
its
master
or
great
personages
of
the
court
of
heaven
and
all
was
set
in
this
little
bare
setting
of
white
walls
a
tumbled
bed
a
shuttered
window
a
guttering
candle
or
two
a
cross
of
ashes
on
boards
a
ring
of
faces
and
a
murmur
of
prayers
the
solemnity
rose
and
fell
in
chris
soul
like
a
deep
sounding
and
waning
how
homely
and
tender
were
these
last
rites
this
accompaniment
of
the
departing
soul
to
the
edge
of
eternity
with
all
that
was
dear
and
familiar
to
it
the
drops
of
holy
water
the
mellow
light
of
candles
and
the
sonorous
soothing
latin
and
yet
and
yet
how
powerless
to
save
a
soul
that
had
not
troubled
to
make
the
necessary
efforts
during
life
and
had
lost
the
power
of
making
them
now
when
all
was
over
he
went
out
of
the
cell
with
an
indescribable
gravity
at
his
heart
when
the
great
events
in
the
spring
of
began
to
take
place
chris
was
in
a
period
of
abstracted
peace
and
the
rumours
of
them
came
to
him
as
cries
from
another
planet
dom
anthony
marks
came
into
the
cloister
one
day
from
the
with
a
great
excitement
in
his
face
here
is
news
he
said
joining
himself
to
chris
and
another
young
monk
with
whom
the
lonely
novice
was
sometimes
allowed
to
walk
master
humphreys
from
london
tells
me
they
are
all
in
a
ferment
there
chris
looked
at
him
with
a
deferential
coldness
and
waited
for
more
they
say
that
master
more
hath
refused
the
oath
and
that
he
is
lodged
in
the
tower
and
my
lord
of
rochester
too
the
young
monk
burst
into
exclamations
and
questions
but
chris
was
silent
it
was
sad
enough
but
what
did
it
matter
to
him
what
did
it
really
matter
to
anyone
god
was
king
dom
anthony
was
in
a
hurry
and
scuffled
off
presently
to
tell
the
prior
and
in
an
hour
or
two
there
was
an
air
of
excitement
through
the
house
chris
however
heard
nothing
more
except
the
little
that
the
chose
to
tell
him
and
felt
a
certain
contempt
for
the
monks
who
broke
the
silence
by
whispers
behind
doors
and
the
peace
of
the
monastery
by
their
perturbed
looks
even
when
a
little
later
in
the
summer
the
commissioner
came
down
to
tender
the
oath
of
succession
chris
heard
little
and
cared
less
he
was
aware
of
a
fine
gentleman
striding
through
the
cloister
lolling
in
the
garth
and
occupying
a
prominent
seat
in
the
church
he
noticed
that
his
master
was
long
in
coming
to
him
after
the
protracted
but
it
appeared
to
him
all
rather
an
irrelevant
matter
these
things
were
surely
quite
apart
from
the
business
for
which
they
were
all
gathered
in
the
house
the
and
the
salvation
of
souls
this
or
that
legal
document
did
not
seriously
affect
such
high
matters
the
told
him
presently
that
the
community
had
signed
the
oath
as
all
others
were
doing
and
that
there
was
no
need
for
anxiety
they
were
in
the
hands
of
their
religious
superiors
i
was
not
anxious
said
chris
abruptly
and
dom
james
hastened
to
snub
him
and
to
tell
him
that
he
ought
to
have
been
but
that
novices
always
thought
they
knew
everything
and
were
the
chief
troubles
that
religious
houses
had
to
put
up
with
chris
courteously
begged
pardon
and
went
to
his
lessons
wondering
what
in
the
world
all
the
pother
was
about
but
such
moods
of
detachment
were
not
continuous
they
visited
him
for
weeks
at
a
time
when
his
soul
was
full
of
consolation
and
he
was
amazed
that
any
other
life
seemed
possible
to
anyone
he
seemed
to
himself
to
have
reached
the
very
heart
and
secret
of
existence
surely
it
was
plain
enough
god
and
eternity
were
the
only
things
worth
considering
a
life
passed
in
an
ecstasy
if
such
were
possible
was
surely
more
consonant
with
reality
than
one
of
ordinary
activities
activities
were
after
all
but
concessions
to
human
weakness
and
desire
for
variety
contemplation
was
the
simple
and
natural
attitude
of
a
soul
that
knew
herself
and
god
but
he
was
a
man
as
well
as
a
novice
and
when
these
moods
ebbed
from
his
soul
they
left
him
strangely
bitter
and
dry
the
clouds
would
gather
the
wind
of
discontent
would
begin
to
shrill
about
the
angles
of
his
spirit
and
presently
the
storm
of
desolation
would
be
up
he
had
one
such
tempestuous
mood
immediately
before
his
profession
during
its
stress
he
had
received
a
letter
from
his
father
which
he
was
allowed
to
read
in
which
sir
james
half
hinted
at
the
advisability
of
postponing
the
irrevocable
step
until
things
were
quieter
and
his
heart
had
leaped
at
the
possibility
of
escape
he
did
not
know
till
then
how
strong
had
grown
the
motive
of
appearing
well
in
the
eyes
of
his
relatives
and
of
fearing
to
lose
their
respect
by
drawing
back
and
now
that
his
father
too
seemed
to
suggest
that
he
had
better
himself
it
appeared
that
a
door
was
opened
in
the
high
monastery
wall
through
which
he
might
go
through
and
take
his
honour
with
him
he
passed
through
a
terrible
struggle
that
night
never
had
the
seemed
so
wearisomely
barren
the
glamour
that
had
lighted
those
dark
walls
and
the
double
row
of
cowls
and
faces
the
mystical
beauty
of
the
single
flames
here
and
there
that
threw
patches
of
light
on
the
carving
of
the
stalls
and
the
sombre
habits
and
gave
visibility
and
significance
to
what
without
them
was
obscure
the
strange
suggestiveness
of
the
roof
and
the
higher
vault
glimmering
through
the
summer
darkness
all
this
had
faded
and
left
him
as
it
seemed
sane
and
perceptive
of
facts
at
last
out
there
through
those
transepts
lay
the
town
where
reasonable
folk
slept
husband
and
wife
together
and
the
children
in
the
great
bed
next
door
with
the
tranquil
ordinary
day
behind
them
and
its
fellow
before
there
were
the
streets
still
now
and
dark
and
empty
but
for
the
sleeping
dogs
where
the
signs
swung
and
the
upper
stories
leaned
together
and
where
the
common
life
had
been
transacted
since
the
birth
of
the
town
and
would
continue
till
its
decay
and
beyond
lay
the
cool
round
hills
with
their
dark
dewy
slopes
over
which
he
had
ridden
a
year
ago
and
all
england
beyond
them
again
with
its
human
life
and
affairs
and
interests
and
over
all
hung
the
serene
stars
whence
god
looked
down
well
pleased
with
all
that
he
had
made
and
meanwhile
here
he
stood
in
his
stall
in
his
night
shoes
and
black
habit
and
cropped
head
propped
on
his
misericorde
with
the
great
pages
open
before
him
thumbed
and
greasy
at
their
corners
from
which
he
was
repeating
in
a
loud
monotone
formula
after
formula
that
had
had
time
to
grow
familiar
from
repetition
but
not
yet
sweet
from
associations
here
he
stood
with
heavy
eyelids
after
his
short
sleep
his
feet
aching
and
hot
and
his
whole
soul
rebellious
he
was
sent
by
his
next
day
to
the
prior
with
his
father
letter
in
his
hand
and
stood
humbly
by
the
door
while
the
prior
read
it
chris
watched
him
under
saw
the
profile
with
its
delicate
mouth
bent
over
the
paper
and
the
hand
with
the
enamelled
ring
turn
the
page
prior
crowham
was
a
cultivated
man
not
over
but
courteous
and
sympathetic
he
turned
a
little
to
chris
in
his
carved
chair
as
he
laid
the
letter
down
well
he
said
smiling
it
is
for
you
to
choose
whether
you
will
offer
yourself
of
course
there
is
uneasiness
abroad
as
this
letter
says
but
what
then
he
smiled
pleasantly
at
the
young
man
and
chris
felt
a
little
ashamed
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
it
is
for
you
to
choose
said
the
prior
again
you
have
been
happy
with
us
i
think
chris
pressed
his
lips
together
and
looked
down
of
course
satan
will
not
leave
you
alone
went
on
the
monk
presently
he
will
suggest
many
reasons
against
your
profession
if
he
did
not
i
should
be
afraid
that
you
had
no
vocation
again
he
waited
for
an
answer
and
again
chris
was
silent
his
soul
was
so
desolate
that
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
say
all
that
he
felt
you
must
wait
a
little
went
on
the
prior
recommend
yourself
to
our
lady
and
our
patron
and
then
leave
yourself
in
their
hands
you
will
know
better
when
you
have
had
a
few
days
will
you
do
this
and
then
come
to
me
again
yes
my
lord
prior
said
chris
and
he
took
up
the
letter
bowed
and
went
out
within
the
week
relief
and
knowledge
came
to
him
he
had
done
what
the
monk
had
told
him
and
it
had
been
followed
by
a
curious
sense
of
relief
at
the
thought
suggested
to
him
that
the
responsibility
of
decision
did
not
rest
on
him
but
on
his
heavenly
helpers
and
then
as
he
served
mass
the
answer
came
it
was
in
the
chapel
of
the
blessed
virgin
a
little
building
entered
from
the
north
transept
with
its
windows
opening
directly
on
to
the
road
leading
up
into
the
town
there
was
no
one
there
but
the
two
it
was
about
seven
on
the
feast
of
the
seven
martyrs
and
the
chapel
was
full
of
a
diffused
tender
morning
light
for
the
chapel
was
sheltered
from
the
direct
sunshine
by
the
tall
church
on
its
south
as
they
went
up
to
the
altar
the
bell
sounded
for
the
elevation
at
the
of
the
church
at
the
and
the
footstep
of
someone
passing
through
the
north
transept
ceased
instantly
at
the
sound
the
priest
ascended
the
steps
set
down
the
vessels
spread
the
corporal
opened
the
book
and
came
down
again
for
the
preparation
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
chapel
and
the
peace
of
the
place
in
the
summer
light
only
vitalized
by
the
brisk
chirping
of
a
sparrow
under
the
eaves
entered
into
christopher
soul
as
the
mass
went
on
it
seemed
as
if
a
veil
were
lifting
from
his
spirit
and
leaving
it
free
and
sensible
again
the
things
around
him
fell
into
their
proper
relationships
and
there
was
no
doubt
in
his
mind
that
this
newly
restored
significance
of
theirs
was
their
true
interpretation
they
seemed
penetrated
and
suffused
by
the
light
of
the
inner
world
the
chasuble
moving
on
a
level
with
his
eyes
stirring
with
the
shifting
of
the
priest
elbows
was
more
than
a
piece
of
rich
stuff
the
white
alb
beneath
more
than
mere
linen
the
hood
thrown
back
in
the
amice
a
sacramental
thing
he
looked
up
at
the
smoky
yellow
flames
against
the
painted
woodwork
at
the
back
of
the
altar
at
the
discoloured
stones
beside
the
grey
still
with
the
slanting
marks
of
the
chisel
upon
them
at
the
black
rafters
overhead
and
last
out
through
the
shafted
window
at
the
heavy
july
foliage
of
the
elm
that
stood
by
the
road
and
the
brilliant
morning
sky
beyond
and
once
more
he
saw
what
these
things
meant
and
conveyed
to
an
immortal
soul
the
words
that
he
had
said
during
these
last
weeks
so
mechanically
were
now
rich
and
alive
again
and
as
he
answered
the
priest
he
perceived
the
spiritual
vibration
of
them
in
the
inner
world
of
which
his
own
soul
was
but
a
part
and
then
the
climax
was
reached
and
he
lifted
the
skirt
of
the
vestment
with
his
left
hand
and
shook
the
bell
in
his
right
the
last
shreds
of
confusion
were
gone
and
his
spirit
basked
tranquil
and
content
and
certain
again
in
the
light
that
was
newly
risen
on
him
he
went
to
the
after
the
and
told
him
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
offer
himself
for
profession
if
it
was
thought
advisable
by
the
authorities
towards
the
end
of
august
he
presented
himself
once
more
before
the
chapter
to
make
his
solemn
demand
his
petition
was
granted
and
a
day
appointed
for
his
profession
then
he
withdrew
into
yet
stricter
seclusion
to
prepare
for
the
step
chapter
ix
life
at
lewes
under
the
direction
of
the
who
overlooked
the
young
monks
for
some
years
after
their
profession
chris
continued
his
work
of
illumination
for
which
he
had
shown
great
aptitude
during
his
year
of
noviceship
the
art
was
beginning
to
disappear
since
the
introduction
of
printing
had
superseded
the
need
of
manuscript
but
in
some
religious
houses
it
was
still
thought
a
suitable
exercise
during
the
hours
appointed
for
manual
labour
it
was
soon
after
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
that
chris
was
entrusted
with
a
printed
antiphonary
that
had
its
borders
and
initials
left
white
and
he
carried
the
great
loose
sheets
with
a
great
deal
of
pride
to
the
little
carrel
or
wooden
stall
assigned
to
him
in
the
northern
cloister
it
was
a
tiny
room
scarcely
six
feet
square
lighted
by
the
window
into
the
and
was
almost
entirely
filled
by
the
chair
the
sloping
desk
against
the
wall
and
the
table
where
the
pigments
and
brushes
lay
ready
to
the
hand
the
door
opened
on
to
the
cloister
itself
where
the
professed
monks
were
at
liberty
to
walk
and
on
the
opposite
side
stood
the
broad
aumbries
that
held
the
library
of
the
house
and
it
was
from
the
books
here
that
chris
was
allowed
to
draw
ideas
for
his
designs
it
was
a
great
step
in
that
life
of
minute
details
when
now
for
the
first
time
he
was
permitted
to
follow
his
own
views
instead
of
merely
filling
in
with
colour
outlines
already
drawn
for
him
and
he
found
his
scheme
for
the
decoration
a
serious
temptation
to
distraction
during
the
office
as
he
stood
among
the
professed
monks
in
his
own
stall
at
last
he
found
his
eyes
wandering
away
to
the
capitals
of
the
round
pillars
the
stone
foliage
and
fruit
that
burst
out
of
the
slender
shafts
the
grim
heads
that
strained
forward
in
mitre
and
crown
overhead
and
even
the
living
faces
of
his
brethren
and
superiors
clear
against
the
dark
woodwork
when
he
bent
his
eyes
resolutely
on
his
book
he
found
his
mind
still
intent
on
his
more
secular
business
he
mentally
corrected
this
awkward
curve
of
the
initial
substituted
an
oak
spray
with
acorns
for
that
stiff
monstrosity
and
set
my
lord
prior
face
grinning
among
griffins
at
the
foot
of
the
page
where
humour
was
more
readily
admitted
it
was
an
immense
joy
when
he
closed
his
after
his
siesta
in
the
dormitory
and
sat
down
to
his
work
he
was
still
warm
with
sleep
and
the
piercing
cold
of
the
unwarmed
cloister
did
not
affect
him
but
he
set
his
feet
on
the
sloping
wooden
footstool
that
rested
on
the
straw
for
fear
they
should
get
cold
and
turned
smiling
to
his
there
were
all
the
precious
things
laid
out
the
crow
quills
sharpened
to
an
almost
invisible
point
for
the
finer
lines
the
two
sets
of
pencils
one
of
that
left
a
faint
grey
line
and
the
other
of
haematite
for
the
burnishing
of
the
gold
the
badger
and
minever
brushes
the
sponge
and
for
erasures
the
horns
for
black
and
red
ink
lay
with
the
scissors
and
rulers
on
the
little
upper
shelf
of
his
desk
there
were
the
pigments
also
there
which
he
had
learnt
to
grind
and
prepare
the
crushed
lapis
lazuli
first
calcined
by
heat
according
to
the
modern
degenerate
practice
with
the
cheap
german
blue
beside
it
and
the
indigo
beyond
the
prasinum
the
vermilion
and
red
lead
ready
mixed
and
the
rubrica
beside
it
the
yellow
orpiment
and
most
important
of
all
the
white
pigments
powdered
chalk
and
egg
shells
lying
by
the
biacca
in
a
separate
compartment
covered
carefully
from
chance
draughts
or
dust
lay
the
precious
gold
leaf
and
a
little
vessel
of
the
inferior
fluid
gold
used
for
narrow
lines
his
first
business
was
to
rule
the
thick
red
lines
down
the
side
of
the
text
using
a
special
metal
pen
for
it
and
then
to
begin
to
sketch
in
his
initials
and
decorations
for
this
latter
part
of
the
work
he
had
decided
to
follow
the
lines
of
foucquet
from
a
book
of
the
hours
that
he
had
taken
out
of
its
aumbry
a
mass
of
delicate
foliage
and
leaves
with
medallions
set
in
it
united
by
twisted
twining
upwards
through
the
broad
border
these
medallions
on
the
first
sheet
he
purposed
to
fill
with
miniatures
of
the
famous
relics
kept
at
lewes
the
hanging
sleeve
of
the
blessed
virgin
in
its
crystal
case
the
of
cana
the
rod
of
moses
and
the
magdalene
box
of
ointment
in
the
later
pages
which
would
be
less
elaborate
he
would
introduce
the
other
relics
and
allow
his
humour
free
play
in
designing
for
the
scrolls
at
the
foot
tiny
portraits
of
his
brethren
the
prior
should
be
in
a
mitre
and
have
the
legs
and
tail
of
a
lion
the
with
a
fox
brush
emerging
from
his
flying
cowl
should
be
running
from
a
hound
who
carried
a
discipline
in
his
near
paw
but
there
was
time
yet
to
think
of
these
things
it
would
be
weeks
before
that
page
could
be
reached
and
meanwhile
there
was
the
foliage
to
be
done
and
the
rose
leaf
that
lay
on
his
desk
to
be
copied
minutely
from
a
hundred
angles
his
distractions
at
mass
and
office
were
worse
than
ever
now
that
the
great
work
was
begun
and
week
after
week
in
confession
there
was
the
same
tale
the
mere
process
was
so
absorbing
apart
from
the
joy
of
creation
and
design
more
than
once
he
woke
from
a
sweating
nightmare
in
the
long
dormitory
believing
that
he
had
laid
on
without
first
painting
the
surface
with
the
necessary
mordant
or
had
run
his
stilus
through
his
most
delicate
miniature
but
he
made
extraordinary
progress
in
the
art
and
the
prior
more
than
once
stepped
into
his
carrel
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
watching
the
slender
fingers
with
the
bone
pen
between
them
polishing
the
gold
till
it
shone
like
a
mirror
or
the
steady
lead
pencil
moving
over
the
white
page
in
faultless
curve
then
he
would
pat
him
on
the
shoulder
and
go
out
in
approving
silence
chris
was
supremely
content
that
he
had
done
right
in
asking
for
profession
it
appeared
to
him
that
he
had
found
a
life
that
was
above
all
others
worthy
of
an
immortal
soul
the
whole
day
routine
was
directed
to
one
end
the
performance
of
the
the
uttering
of
praises
to
him
who
had
made
and
was
sustaining
and
would
receive
again
all
things
to
himself
they
rose
at
midnight
for
the
that
the
sleeping
world
might
not
be
wholly
dumb
to
god
went
to
rest
again
rose
once
more
with
the
world
and
set
about
a
yet
sublimer
worship
a
stream
of
sacrifice
poured
up
to
the
throne
through
the
mellow
summer
morning
or
the
cold
winter
darkness
and
gloom
from
altar
after
altar
in
the
great
church
christopher
remembered
pleasantly
a
morning
soon
after
the
beginning
of
his
novitiate
when
he
had
been
in
the
church
as
a
set
of
priests
came
in
and
began
mass
simultaneously
the
mystical
fancy
suggested
itself
as
the
hum
of
voices
began
that
he
was
in
a
garden
warm
and
bright
with
grace
and
that
bees
were
about
him
making
honey
that
fragrant
sweetness
of
which
it
had
been
said
long
ago
that
god
should
eat
and
as
the
tinkle
of
the
elevation
sounded
out
here
and
there
it
seemed
to
him
as
a
signal
that
the
mysterious
confection
was
done
and
that
every
altar
sprang
into
perfume
from
those
silver
vessels
set
with
jewel
and
crystal
when
the
first
masses
were
over
there
was
a
pause
in
which
the
was
taken
bread
and
wine
or
beer
standing
in
the
refectory
after
a
short
prayer
that
the
giver
of
all
good
gifts
might
bless
the
food
and
drink
of
his
servants
and
was
closed
again
by
another
prayer
said
privately
for
all
benefactors
meanwhile
the
bell
was
ringing
for
the
lady
mass
to
remind
the
monks
that
the
interval
was
only
as
it
were
a
parenthetical
concession
and
after
terce
and
the
lady
mass
followed
the
chapter
in
which
faults
were
confessed
and
penances
inflicted
and
the
living
instruments
of
god
work
were
examined
and
scoured
for
use
the
martyrology
was
read
at
this
time
as
well
as
some
morning
prayers
to
keep
before
the
monks
minds
the
remembrance
of
those
great
vessels
of
god
household
called
to
so
high
an
employment
it
was
then
too
that
other
business
of
the
house
was
done
and
the
seal
affixed
to
any
necessary
documents
christopher
had
an
opportunity
once
of
examining
this
seal
when
it
had
been
given
him
to
clean
and
he
looked
with
awe
on
the
figures
of
his
four
new
patrons
peter
pancras
paul
and
our
lady
set
in
niches
above
a
cliff
with
the
running
water
of
the
ouse
beneath
and
read
the
petition
that
ran
round
the
circle
agonista
tibi
convertit
domus
ista
pancrati
memorum
precibus
memor
esto
when
the
chapter
was
over
and
the
deaths
of
any
brethren
of
the
order
had
been
announced
and
their
souls
prayed
for
there
was
a
pause
for
recreation
in
the
cloister
and
the
finishing
of
further
business
before
they
assembled
again
in
time
to
go
into
church
for
the
high
mass
at
which
the
work
and
prayers
of
the
day
were
gathered
up
and
consecrated
in
a
supreme
offering
even
the
dinner
that
followed
was
a
religious
ceremony
it
began
by
a
salutation
of
the
christ
in
glory
that
was
on
the
wall
over
the
prior
table
and
then
a
long
grace
was
sung
before
they
took
their
seats
the
reader
in
the
on
the
south
wall
of
the
refectory
began
his
business
on
the
sounding
of
a
bell
and
at
a
second
stroke
there
was
a
hum
and
clash
of
dishes
from
the
kitchen
end
and
the
aproned
servers
entered
in
line
bearing
the
dishes
immediately
the
meal
was
begun
the
drink
destined
for
the
poor
at
the
gate
was
set
aside
and
a
little
later
a
representative
of
them
was
brought
into
the
refectory
to
receive
his
portion
at
the
close
again
what
was
left
over
was
collected
for
charity
while
the
community
after
singing
part
of
the
grace
after
meat
went
to
finish
it
in
the
church
chris
learned
to
love
the
quiet
religious
graciousness
of
the
refectory
the
taking
of
food
here
was
a
consecrated
action
it
seemed
a
sacramental
thing
he
loved
the
restraint
and
preciseness
of
it
ensured
by
the
solemn
crucifix
over
the
door
with
its
pathetic
inscription
sitio
the
polished
oak
tables
solid
and
narrow
the
shining
pewter
dishes
the
folded
napkins
the
plentiful
food
to
each
man
his
portion
the
indescribable
dignity
of
the
prior
little
table
the
bowing
of
the
servers
before
it
the
mellow
grace
ringing
out
in
its
monotone
that
broke
into
minor
thirds
and
octaves
of
melody
like
a
grave
line
of
woodwork
on
the
panelling
bursting
into
a
stiff
leaf
or
two
at
its
ends
there
was
a
strange
and
wonderful
romance
it
about
on
early
autumn
evenings
as
the
light
died
out
behind
the
stained
windows
and
the
reader
face
glowed
homely
and
strong
between
his
two
candles
on
the
pulpit
and
surely
these
tales
of
saints
the
extract
from
the
rule
these
portions
of
scripture
sung
with
long
pauses
and
on
a
monotone
for
fear
that
the
reader
personality
should
obscure
the
message
of
what
he
read
surely
this
was
a
better
accompaniment
to
the
taking
of
food
in
itself
so
gross
a
thing
than
the
feverish
chatter
of
a
secular
hall
and
the
bustling
and
officiousness
of
paid
servants
after
a
general
washing
of
hands
the
monks
dispersed
to
their
work
and
the
novices
to
bowls
or
other
games
the
prior
first
distributing
the
garden
instruments
and
then
beginning
the
labour
with
a
commendation
of
it
to
god
and
after
finishing
the
manual
work
and
a
short
time
of
study
they
in
the
cloister
to
go
to
vespers
this
like
the
high
mass
was
performed
with
the
ceremonial
proper
to
the
day
and
was
followed
by
supper
at
which
the
same
kind
of
ceremonies
were
observed
as
at
dinner
when
this
was
over
after
a
further
short
interval
the
evening
reading
or
collation
took
place
in
the
after
which
the
monks
were
at
liberty
to
go
and
warm
themselves
at
the
one
great
fire
kept
up
for
the
purpose
in
the
calefactory
and
then
compline
was
sung
followed
by
our
lady
anthem
this
for
chris
was
one
of
the
climaxes
of
the
day
emotions
he
was
always
tired
out
by
now
with
the
day
work
and
longing
for
bed
and
this
approach
to
the
great
mother
of
monks
soothed
and
quieted
him
it
was
sung
in
almost
complete
darkness
except
for
a
light
or
two
in
the
long
nave
where
a
dark
figure
or
two
would
be
kneeling
and
the
pleasant
familiar
melody
accompanied
softly
by
the
organ
overhead
after
the
bare
singing
of
compline
seemed
like
a
kind
of
kiss
the
infinite
pathos
of
the
words
never
failed
to
touch
him
the
cry
of
the
banished
children
of
eve
weeping
and
mourning
in
this
vale
of
tears
to
mary
whose
obedience
had
restored
what
eve
had
ruined
and
the
last
threefold
sob
of
endearment
to
the
kindly
loving
sweet
virgin
mary
after
the
high
agonisings
and
aspirations
of
the
prayer
the
awfulness
of
the
holy
sacrifice
the
tramping
monotony
of
the
psalter
the
sting
of
the
discipline
the
aches
and
sweats
of
the
manual
labour
the
intent
strain
of
the
illuminating
this
song
to
mary
was
a
running
into
mother
arms
and
finding
compensation
there
for
all
toils
and
burdens
finally
in
complete
silence
the
monks
passed
along
the
dark
cloister
sprinkled
with
holy
water
as
they
left
the
church
up
to
the
dormitory
which
ran
over
the
whole
length
of
the
chapter
house
the
bridges
and
other
offices
to
sleep
till
midnight
the
effect
of
this
life
unbroken
by
external
distractions
was
to
make
chris
soul
alert
and
perceptive
to
the
inner
world
and
careless
or
even
contemptuous
of
the
ordinary
world
of
men
this
spiritual
realm
began
for
the
first
time
to
disclose
its
details
to
him
and
to
show
itself
to
some
extent
a
replica
of
nature
it
too
had
its
varying
climate
its
long
summer
of
warmth
and
light
its
winter
of
dark
discontent
its
strange
and
bewildering
sunrises
of
christ
upon
the
soul
when
he
rose
and
went
about
his
garden
with
perfume
and
music
or
stayed
and
greeted
his
creature
with
the
message
of
his
eyes
chris
began
to
learn
that
these
spiritual
changes
were
in
a
sense
independent
of
him
that
they
were
not
in
his
soul
but
rather
that
his
soul
was
in
them
he
could
be
happy
and
content
when
the
winds
of
god
were
cold
and
his
light
darkened
or
sad
and
comfortless
when
the
flowers
of
grace
were
apparent
and
the
river
of
life
bright
and
shining
and
meanwhile
the
ordinary
world
went
on
but
far
away
and
dimly
heard
and
seen
as
when
one
looks
down
from
a
on
to
humming
streets
five
hundred
feet
below
and
the
old
life
at
overfield
and
ralph
doings
in
london
seemed
unreal
and
fantastic
activities
purposeless
and
empty
little
by
little
however
as
the
point
of
view
shifted
chris
began
to
find
that
the
external
world
could
not
be
banished
and
that
the
annoyances
from
the
clash
of
characters
discordant
with
his
own
were
as
positive
as
those
which
had
distressed
him
before
dom
anselm
way
of
walking
and
the
patch
of
grease
at
the
shoulder
of
his
cowl
never
removed
and
visible
as
he
went
before
him
into
the
church
was
as
distractingly
irritating
as
ralph
contempt
the
buzz
in
the
voice
of
a
cantor
who
seemed
always
to
sing
on
great
days
was
as
distressing
as
his
own
dog
perversity
at
overfield
or
the
snapping
of
a
when
fell
upon
chris
it
seemed
as
if
this
particular
house
was
entirely
ruined
by
such
incidents
the
prior
was
finickin
the
tyrannical
the
paints
for
illumination
inferior
in
quality
the
straw
of
his
bed
peculiarly
sharp
the
unnecessarily
draughty
and
until
he
learnt
from
his
confessor
that
this
spiritual
ailment
was
a
perfectly
familiar
one
and
that
its
symptoms
and
effects
had
been
diagnosed
centuries
before
and
had
taken
him
at
his
word
and
practised
the
remedies
he
enjoined
chris
suffered
considerably
from
discontent
and
despair
alternately
at
times
others
were
intolerable
at
times
he
was
intolerable
to
himself
reproaching
himself
for
having
attempted
so
high
a
life
criticising
his
fellows
for
so
lowering
it
to
a
poor
standard
the
first
time
that
he
was
accused
in
chapter
of
a
fault
against
the
rule
was
a
very
great
and
shocking
humiliation
he
had
accused
himself
as
usual
on
his
knees
of
his
own
remissions
of
making
an
unnecessarily
loud
noise
in
drinking
of
intoning
a
wrong
antiphon
as
cantor
of
spilling
crumbs
in
the
refectory
and
then
leaned
back
on
his
heels
well
content
with
the
insignificance
of
his
list
to
listen
with
a
discreet
complacency
to
old
dom
adrian
who
had
overslept
himself
once
spilled
his
beer
twice
criticised
his
superior
and
talked
aloud
to
himself
four
times
during
the
greater
silence
and
who
now
mumbled
out
his
crimes
hastily
and
unconcernedly
when
the
were
done
the
others
began
and
to
his
horror
chris
heard
his
own
name
spoken
i
accuse
dom
christopher
torridon
of
not
keeping
the
guard
of
the
eyes
at
terce
this
morning
it
was
perfectly
true
chris
had
been
so
much
absorbed
in
noticing
an
effect
of
shade
thrown
by
a
corbel
and
in
plans
for
incorporating
it
into
his
illumination
that
he
had
let
a
verse
pass
as
far
as
the
star
that
marked
the
pause
he
felt
his
heart
leap
with
resentment
then
a
flash
of
retort
came
to
him
and
he
waited
his
turn
i
accuse
dom
bernard
parr
of
not
keeping
the
guard
of
the
eyes
at
terce
this
morning
he
was
observing
me
just
the
faintest
ripple
passed
round
the
line
and
then
the
prior
spoke
with
a
tinge
of
sharpness
inflicting
the
penances
and
giving
chris
a
heavy
sentence
of
twenty
strokes
with
the
discipline
when
chris
turn
came
he
threw
back
his
habit
petulantly
and
administered
his
own
punishment
as
the
custom
was
with
angry
fervour
as
he
was
going
out
the
prior
made
him
a
sign
and
took
him
through
into
his
own
cell
are
contrary
to
the
rule
he
said
it
must
not
happen
again
and
dismissed
him
sternly
and
then
chris
for
a
couple
of
days
had
a
fierce
struggle
against
uncharitableness
asking
himself
whether
he
had
not
eyed
dom
bernard
with
resentment
and
then
eyeing
him
again
it
seemed
too
as
if
a
fiend
suggested
bitter
sentences
of
reproach
that
he
rehearsed
to
himself
and
then
repented
but
on
the
third
morning
there
came
one
of
those
strange
breezes
of
grace
that
he
was
beginning
to
experience
more
and
more
frequently
and
his
sore
soul
grew
warm
and
peaceful
again
it
was
in
those
kinds
of
temptation
now
that
he
found
his
warfare
to
lie
internal
assaults
so
fierce
that
it
was
terribly
difficult
to
know
whether
he
had
yielded
or
not
sudden
images
of
pride
and
anger
and
lust
that
presented
themselves
so
vividly
and
attractively
that
it
seemed
he
must
have
willed
them
it
was
not
often
that
he
was
tempted
to
sin
in
word
or
deed
such
when
they
came
rushed
on
him
suddenly
but
in
the
realm
of
thought
and
imagination
and
motive
he
would
often
find
himself
as
it
were
entering
a
swarm
of
such
things
that
hovered
round
him
impeding
his
prayer
blinding
his
insight
and
seeking
to
sting
the
very
heart
of
his
spiritual
life
then
once
more
he
would
fight
himself
free
by
despising
and
rejecting
them
or
would
emerge
without
conscious
will
of
his
own
into
clearness
and
serenity
but
as
he
looked
back
he
regretted
nothing
it
was
true
that
the
warfare
was
more
subtle
and
internal
but
it
was
more
honourable
too
for
to
conquer
a
motive
or
tame
an
imagination
was
at
once
more
arduous
and
more
in
its
effects
than
a
victory
in
merely
outward
matters
and
he
seldom
failed
to
thank
god
times
a
day
for
having
given
him
the
vocation
of
a
monk
there
was
one
danger
however
that
he
did
not
realise
and
his
confessor
failed
to
point
it
out
to
him
and
that
was
the
danger
of
the
wrong
kind
of
detachment
as
has
been
already
seen
the
theory
of
the
religious
life
was
that
men
sought
it
not
merely
for
the
salvation
of
their
own
souls
but
for
that
of
the
world
a
monastery
was
a
place
where
in
a
special
sense
the
spiritual
commerce
of
the
world
was
carried
on
as
a
workman
shed
is
the
place
deputed
and
used
by
the
world
for
the
manufacture
of
certain
articles
it
was
the
manufactory
of
grace
where
skilled
persons
were
at
work
busy
at
a
task
of
prayer
and
sacrament
which
was
to
be
at
other
men
service
if
the
father
of
a
family
had
a
piece
of
spiritual
work
to
be
done
he
went
to
the
monastery
and
arranged
for
it
and
paid
a
fee
for
the
sustenance
of
those
he
employed
as
he
might
go
to
a
merchant
to
order
a
cargo
and
settle
for
its
delivery
since
this
was
so
then
it
was
necessary
that
the
spiritual
workmen
should
be
in
a
certain
touch
with
those
for
whom
they
worked
it
was
true
that
they
must
be
out
of
the
world
undominated
by
its
principles
and
out
of
love
with
its
spirit
but
in
another
sense
they
must
live
in
its
heart
to
use
another
analogy
they
were
as
windmills
lifted
up
from
the
earth
into
the
high
airs
of
grace
but
their
base
must
be
on
the
ground
or
their
labour
would
be
they
must
be
mystically
one
with
the
world
that
they
had
resigned
chris
forgot
this
and
laboured
and
to
a
large
extent
succeeded
in
detaching
himself
wholly
and
symptoms
of
this
mistake
showed
themselves
in
such
things
as
tending
to
despise
secular
life
feeling
impatient
with
the
poor
to
whom
he
had
to
minister
in
sneering
in
his
heart
at
least
at
anxious
fussy
men
who
came
to
arrange
for
masses
at
troublesome
women
who
haunted
the
sacristy
door
in
a
passion
of
elaborateness
and
at
comfortable
families
who
stamped
into
high
mass
and
filled
a
seat
and
a
half
but
who
had
yet
their
spiritual
burdens
and
their
claims
to
honour
but
he
was
to
be
brought
rudely
down
to
facts
again
he
was
beginning
to
forget
that
england
was
about
him
and
stirring
in
her
agony
and
he
was
reminded
of
it
with
some
force
in
the
winter
after
his
profession
he
was
going
out
to
the
one
day
on
an
errand
from
the
when
he
became
aware
of
an
unusual
stir
in
the
court
there
were
a
couple
of
palfreys
there
and
mules
behind
whilst
three
or
four
strange
monks
with
a
servant
or
two
stood
at
their
bridles
chris
stopped
to
consider
for
he
had
no
business
with
guests
and
as
he
hesitated
the
door
of
the
opened
and
two
prelates
came
out
with
dom
anthony
behind
them
tall
stately
men
in
monks
habits
with
furred
cloaks
and
crosses
chris
slipped
back
at
once
into
the
cloister
from
which
he
had
just
come
out
and
watched
them
go
past
to
the
lodging
they
appeared
at
vespers
that
afternoon
again
sitting
in
the
first
returned
stalls
near
the
prior
and
chris
recognised
one
of
them
as
the
great
abbot
of
colchester
he
looked
at
him
now
and
again
during
vespers
with
a
reverential
awe
for
the
abbot
was
a
great
man
a
spiritual
peer
of
immense
influence
and
reputation
and
watched
that
fatherly
face
his
dignified
bows
and
stately
movements
and
the
great
sapphire
that
shone
on
his
hand
as
he
turned
the
leaves
of
his
illuminated
book
the
two
prelates
were
at
supper
sitting
on
either
side
of
the
prior
on
the
dais
and
afterwards
the
monks
were
called
earlier
than
usual
from
recreation
into
the
the
prior
made
them
a
little
speech
saying
that
the
abbot
had
something
to
say
to
them
and
then
sat
down
his
troubled
eyes
ran
over
the
faces
of
his
subjects
and
his
fingers
twitched
and
fidgetted
on
his
knees
the
abbot
did
not
make
them
a
long
discourse
but
told
them
briefly
that
there
was
trouble
coming
he
spoke
in
veiled
terms
of
the
act
of
supremacy
and
the
serious
prayer
that
was
needed
he
said
that
a
time
of
testing
was
close
at
hand
and
that
every
man
must
scrutinise
his
own
conscience
and
examine
his
motives
and
that
the
unlearned
had
better
follow
the
advice
and
example
of
their
superiors
it
was
all
very
vague
and
unsatisfactory
but
chris
became
aware
of
three
things
first
that
the
world
was
very
much
alive
and
could
not
be
dismissed
by
a
pious
aspiration
or
two
second
that
the
world
was
about
to
make
some
demand
that
would
have
to
be
seriously
dealt
with
and
third
that
there
was
nothing
really
to
fear
so
long
as
their
souls
were
clean
and
courageous
the
abbot
was
a
melting
speaker
full
at
once
of
a
fatherly
tenderness
and
vehemence
and
as
chris
looked
at
him
he
felt
that
indeed
there
was
nothing
to
fear
so
long
as
monks
had
such
representatives
and
protectors
as
these
and
that
the
world
had
better
look
to
itself
for
fear
it
should
dash
itself
to
ruin
against
such
rocks
of
faith
and
holiness
but
as
the
spring
drew
on
an
air
of
suspense
and
anxiety
made
itself
evident
in
the
house
news
came
down
that
more
and
fisher
were
still
in
prison
that
the
oath
was
being
administered
right
and
left
that
the
king
had
thrown
aside
all
restraints
and
that
the
civil
breach
with
rome
seemed
in
no
prospect
of
healing
as
for
the
spiritual
breach
the
monks
did
not
seriously
consider
it
yet
they
regarded
themselves
as
still
in
union
with
the
holy
see
whatever
their
rulers
might
say
or
do
and
only
prayed
for
the
time
when
things
might
be
as
before
and
there
should
be
no
longer
any
doubt
or
hesitation
in
the
minds
of
weak
brethren
but
the
prior
face
grew
more
white
and
troubled
and
his
temper
uncertain
now
and
again
he
would
make
them
speeches
assuring
them
fiercely
that
all
was
well
and
that
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
be
quiet
and
obedient
and
now
he
would
give
way
to
a
kind
of
angry
despair
tell
them
that
all
was
lost
that
every
man
would
have
to
save
himself
and
then
for
days
after
such
an
exhibition
he
would
be
silent
and
morose
rapping
his
fingers
softly
as
he
sat
at
his
little
raised
table
in
the
refectory
walking
with
downcast
eyes
up
and
down
the
cloister
muttering
and
staring
towards
the
end
of
april
he
sent
abruptly
for
chris
told
him
that
he
had
news
from
london
that
made
his
presence
there
necessary
and
ordered
him
to
be
ready
to
ride
with
him
in
a
week
or
two
chapter
x
the
arena
it
was
in
the
evening
of
a
warm
may
day
that
the
prior
and
chris
arrived
at
the
hostelry
in
southwark
which
belonged
to
lewes
priory
it
was
on
the
south
side
of
kater
lane
opposite
olave
church
a
great
house
built
of
stone
with
arched
gates
with
a
large
porch
opening
straight
into
the
hall
which
was
high
and
vaulted
with
a
frieze
of
grotesque
animals
and
foliage
running
round
it
there
were
a
few
servants
there
and
one
or
two
friends
of
the
prior
waiting
at
the
porch
as
they
arrived
and
one
of
them
a
monk
himself
from
the
cell
at
farley
stepped
up
to
the
prior
stirrup
and
whispered
to
him
chris
heard
an
exclamation
and
a
sharp
indrawing
of
breath
but
was
too
well
trained
to
ask
so
he
too
dismounted
and
followed
the
others
into
the
hall
leaving
his
beast
in
the
hands
of
a
servant
the
prior
was
already
standing
by
the
monk
at
the
upper
end
questioning
him
closely
and
glancing
nervously
this
way
and
that
he
asked
sharply
and
looked
at
the
other
horrified
the
monk
nodded
and
anxious
his
lower
lip
sucked
in
the
prior
turned
to
chris
they
have
suffered
he
said
news
had
reached
lewes
nearly
a
week
before
that
the
carthusians
had
been
condemned
for
refusing
to
acknowledge
the
king
as
head
of
the
english
church
but
it
had
been
scarcely
possible
to
believe
that
the
sentence
would
be
carried
out
and
chris
felt
the
blood
beat
in
his
temples
and
his
lips
turn
suddenly
dry
as
he
heard
the
news
i
was
there
my
lord
prior
said
the
monk
he
was
a
man
genial
and
plump
but
his
face
was
white
and
anxious
now
and
his
mouth
worked
they
were
hanged
in
their
habits
he
went
on
prior
houghton
was
the
first
despatched
and
he
added
a
terrible
detail
or
two
will
you
see
the
place
my
lord
prior
he
said
you
can
ride
there
your
palfrey
is
still
at
the
door
prior
robert
crowham
looked
at
him
a
moment
with
pursed
lips
and
then
shook
his
head
violently
no
no
he
said
i
i
must
see
to
the
house
the
monk
looked
at
chris
may
i
go
my
lord
prior
he
asked
the
prior
stared
at
him
a
moment
in
a
desperate
effort
to
fix
his
attention
then
nodded
sharply
and
wheeled
round
to
the
door
that
led
to
the
upper
rooms
mother
of
god
he
said
mother
of
god
and
went
out
chris
went
through
with
the
strange
priest
down
the
hall
and
out
into
the
porch
again
the
others
were
standing
there
fearful
and
whispering
and
opened
out
to
let
the
two
monks
pass
through
chris
had
been
tired
and
hot
when
he
arrived
but
he
was
conscious
now
of
no
sensation
but
of
an
overmastering
desire
to
see
the
place
he
passed
straight
by
his
horse
that
still
stood
with
a
servant
at
his
head
and
turned
up
instinctively
toward
the
river
the
monk
called
after
him
there
there
he
cried
not
so
fast
we
have
plenty
of
time
they
took
a
wherry
at
the
stairs
and
pushed
out
with
the
stream
the
waterman
was
a
man
who
spoke
no
word
but
whistled
to
himself
cheerfully
as
he
laid
himself
to
the
oars
and
the
boat
began
to
move
slantingly
across
the
flowing
tide
he
looked
at
the
monks
now
and
again
but
chris
was
seated
staring
out
with
eyes
that
saw
nothing
down
the
broad
stream
away
to
where
the
cathedral
rose
gigantic
and
graceful
on
the
other
side
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
been
in
london
since
a
couple
of
years
before
his
profession
but
the
splendour
and
strength
of
the
city
was
nothing
to
him
now
it
only
had
one
significance
to
his
mind
and
that
that
it
had
been
this
day
the
scene
of
a
martyrdom
his
mind
that
had
so
long
lived
in
the
inner
world
moving
among
supernatural
things
was
struggling
desperately
to
adjust
itself
once
or
twice
his
lips
moved
and
his
hands
clenched
themselves
under
his
scapular
but
he
saw
and
heard
nothing
and
did
not
even
turn
his
head
when
a
barge
swept
past
them
and
a
richly
dressed
man
leaned
from
the
stern
and
shouted
something
mockingly
the
other
monk
looked
nervously
and
deprecatingly
up
for
he
heard
the
taunting
threat
across
the
water
that
the
carthusians
were
a
good
riddance
and
that
there
would
be
more
to
follow
they
landed
at
the
blackfriars
stairs
paid
the
man
who
was
still
whistling
as
he
took
the
money
and
passed
up
by
the
little
stream
that
flowed
into
the
river
striking
off
to
the
left
presently
and
leaving
the
city
behind
them
they
were
soon
out
again
on
the
long
straight
road
that
led
to
tyburn
for
chris
walked
desperately
fast
paying
little
heed
to
his
companion
except
at
the
corners
when
he
had
to
wait
to
know
the
way
and
presently
began
to
raise
its
head
high
against
the
sky
once
the
strange
monk
whose
name
chris
had
not
even
troubled
to
ask
plucked
him
by
his
hanging
sleeve
the
hurdles
came
along
here
he
said
and
chris
looked
at
him
vacantly
as
if
he
did
not
understand
then
they
were
under
and
the
clump
of
elms
stood
before
them
it
was
a
wide
open
space
dusty
now
and
trampled
what
grass
there
had
been
in
patches
by
the
two
little
streams
that
flowed
together
here
was
crushed
and
flat
under
foot
the
elms
cast
long
shadows
from
the
west
and
birds
were
chirping
in
the
branches
there
was
a
group
or
two
of
people
here
and
there
looking
curiously
about
them
a
man
voice
came
across
the
open
space
explaining
and
his
arm
rose
and
wheeled
and
pointed
and
paused
three
or
four
children
hung
together
frightened
and
interested
but
chris
saw
little
of
all
this
he
had
no
eyes
for
the
passing
details
they
were
fixed
on
the
low
mound
that
rose
fifty
yards
away
and
the
three
tall
posts
placed
in
a
triangle
and
united
by
that
stood
on
it
gaunt
against
the
sky
as
he
came
nearer
to
it
walking
as
one
in
a
dream
across
the
dusty
ground
and
trampled
grass
and
paying
no
heed
to
the
priest
behind
him
who
whispered
with
an
angry
nervousness
he
was
aware
of
the
ends
of
three
or
four
ropes
that
hung
motionless
from
the
beams
in
the
still
evening
air
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
these
in
exaltation
and
terror
he
stumbled
up
the
sloping
ground
and
came
beneath
them
there
was
a
great
peace
round
him
as
he
stood
there
stroking
one
of
the
uprights
with
a
kind
of
mechanical
tenderness
the
men
were
silent
as
they
saw
the
two
monks
there
and
watched
to
see
what
they
would
do
the
towers
of
rose
a
hundred
yards
away
empty
now
but
crowded
this
morning
and
behind
them
the
long
road
with
the
fields
and
great
mansions
on
this
side
and
that
leading
down
to
the
city
in
front
and
westminster
on
the
right
those
two
dens
of
the
tiger
that
had
snarled
so
fiercely
a
few
hours
before
as
she
licked
her
lips
red
with
martyrs
blood
it
was
indescribably
peaceful
now
there
was
no
sound
but
the
birds
overhead
and
the
soft
breeze
in
the
young
leaves
and
the
trickle
of
the
streams
defiled
but
running
clean
and
guiltless
now
and
the
level
sunlight
lay
across
the
wide
flat
ground
and
threw
the
shadow
of
the
mound
and
gallows
nearly
to
the
foot
of
the
gate
but
to
chris
the
place
was
alive
with
phantoms
the
empty
space
had
vanished
and
a
sea
of
faces
seemed
turned
up
to
him
he
fancied
that
there
were
figures
about
him
watching
him
too
brushing
his
sleeve
faces
looking
into
his
eyes
waiting
for
some
action
or
word
from
him
for
a
moment
his
sense
of
identity
was
lost
the
violence
of
the
associations
and
perhaps
even
the
power
of
the
emotions
that
had
been
wrought
there
that
day
crushed
out
his
personality
it
was
surely
he
who
was
here
to
suffer
all
else
was
a
dream
and
an
illusion
from
his
very
effort
of
living
in
eternity
a
habit
had
been
formed
that
now
asserted
itself
the
laws
of
time
and
space
and
circumstance
for
the
moment
ceased
to
exist
and
he
found
himself
for
an
eternal
instant
facing
his
own
agony
and
death
then
with
a
rush
facts
themselves
and
he
started
and
looked
round
as
the
monk
touched
him
on
the
arm
you
have
seen
it
he
said
in
a
sharp
undertone
it
is
enough
we
shall
be
attacked
chris
paid
him
no
heed
beyond
a
look
and
turned
once
more
it
was
here
that
they
had
suffered
these
gallant
knights
of
god
they
had
stood
below
these
beams
their
feet
on
the
cart
that
was
their
chariot
of
glory
their
necks
in
the
rope
that
would
be
their
heavenly
badge
they
had
looked
out
where
he
was
looking
as
they
made
their
little
speeches
over
the
faces
to
with
the
same
sun
that
was
now
behind
him
shining
into
their
eyes
he
still
stroked
the
rough
beam
and
as
the
details
came
home
and
he
remembered
that
it
was
this
that
had
borne
their
weight
he
leaned
and
kissed
it
and
a
flood
of
tears
blinded
him
again
the
priest
pulled
his
sleeve
sharply
for
god
sake
brother
he
said
chris
turned
to
him
the
cauldron
he
said
where
was
that
the
priest
made
an
impatient
movement
but
pointed
to
one
side
away
from
where
the
men
were
standing
still
watching
them
and
chris
saw
below
by
the
side
of
one
of
the
streams
a
great
blackened
patch
of
ground
and
a
heap
of
ashes
the
two
went
down
there
for
the
other
monk
was
thankful
to
get
to
any
less
conspicuous
place
and
chris
presently
found
himself
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
black
patch
with
the
trampled
mud
and
grass
beyond
it
beside
the
stream
the
grey
wood
ashes
had
drifted
by
now
far
across
the
ground
but
the
heavy
logs
still
lay
there
charred
and
smoked
that
had
blazed
beneath
the
cauldron
where
the
limbs
of
the
monks
had
been
seethed
and
he
stared
down
at
them
numbed
and
fascinated
by
the
horror
of
the
thought
his
mind
now
in
a
violent
reaction
seemed
unable
to
cope
with
its
own
knowledge
crushed
beneath
its
weight
and
his
friend
heard
him
repeating
with
a
low
monotonous
insistence
here
it
was
he
said
here
here
was
the
cauldron
it
was
here
then
he
turned
and
looked
into
his
friend
eyes
it
was
here
he
said
are
you
sure
it
was
here
the
other
made
an
impatient
sound
where
else
he
said
sharply
come
brother
you
have
seen
enough
he
told
him
more
details
as
they
walked
home
as
to
what
each
had
said
and
how
each
had
borne
himself
father
reynolds
the
syon
monk
had
looked
gaily
about
him
it
seemed
as
he
walked
up
from
the
hurdle
the
secular
priest
had
turned
pale
and
shut
his
eyes
more
than
once
the
three
carthusian
priors
had
been
unmoved
throughout
showing
neither
carelessness
nor
fear
prior
houghton

had
been
taken
off
to
the
london
charterhouse
as
a
terror
to
the
others
their
heads
he
had
heard
were
on
london
bridge
chris
walked
slowly
as
he
listened
holding
tight
under
his
scapular
the
scrap
of
rough
white
cloth
he
had
picked
up
near
the
cauldron
drinking
in
every
detail
and
painting
it
into
the
mental
picture
that
was
forming
in
his
mind
but
there
was
much
more
in
the
picture
than
the
other
guessed
the
priest
was
a
plain
man
with
a
talent
for
the
practical
and
knew
nothing
of
the
vision
that
the
young
monk
beside
him
was
seeing
of
the
air
about
the
gallows
crowded
with
the
angels
of
the
agony
and
passion
waiting
to
bear
off
the
straggling
souls
in
their
tender
experienced
hands
of
the
celestial
faces
looking
down
the
scarred
and
glorious
arms
stretched
out
in
welcome
of
mary

her
mother
eyes
and
her
virgins
about
her
all

deepening
splendour

chapter
xi
a
ralph
kept
his
resolution
to
pretend
to
try
and
save
sir
thomas
more
and
salved
his
own
conscience
by
protesting
to
beatrice
that
his
efforts
were
bound
to
fail
and
that
he
had
no
influence
such
as
she
imagined
he
did
certainly
more
than
once
remark
to
cromwell
that
sir
thomas
was
a
pleasant
and
learned
man
and
had
treated
him
kindly
and
once
had
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
did
not
see
that
any
good
would
be
served
by
his
death
but
he
had
been
sharply
rebuked
and
told
to
mind
his
own
business
then
softening
cromwell
had
explained
that
there
was
no
question
of
death
for
the
present
but
that
more
persistent
refusal
to
yield
to
the
pressure
of
events
was
a
standing
peril
to
the
policy
this
policy
had
now
shaped
itself
more
clearly
in
the
autumn
of
the
bill
for
the
king
supremacy
over
the
church
of
england
began
to
take
form
and
ralph
had
several
sights
of
the
documents
as
all
business
of
this
kind
now
flowed
through
cromwell
hands
and
he
was
filled
with
admiration
and
at
the
same
time
with
perplexity
at
the
adroitness
of
the
wording
it
was
very
short
and
affected
to
assume
rather
than
to
enact
its
object
albeit
the
king
majesty
justly
and
rightfully
is
and
ought
to
be
it
began
the
supreme
head
of
the
church
of
england
and
so
is
recognised
by
the
clergy
of
this
realm
in
their
convocations
yet
nevertheless
for
corroboration
and
confirmation
thereof
and
to
repress
and
extirp
all
errors
heresies
and
other
enormities
be
it
enacted
by
authority
of
this
present
parliament
that
the
king
our
sovereign
lord
shall
be
taken
accepted
and
reputed
the
only
supreme
head
in
earth
of
the
church
of
england
called
the
bill
then
proceeded
to
confer
on
him
a
plenitude
of
authority
over
both
temporal
and
spiritual
causes
there
was
here
considerable
skill
in
the
manner
of
its
drawing
up
which
it
owed
chiefly
to
cromwell
for
it
professed
only
to
a
matter
that
had
slipped
out
of
notice
and
appealed
to
the
authority
of
convocation
which
had
truly
under
warham
allowed
a
resolution
to
the
same
effect
though
qualified
by
the
clause
as
far
as
god
law
permits
to
pass
in
silence
ralph
was
puzzled
by
it
he
was
led
to
believe
that
it
could
contain
no
very
radical
change
from
the
old
belief
since
the
clergy
had
in
a
sense
already
submitted
to
it
and
on
the
other
hand
the
word
the
only
supreme
head
in
earth
seemed
not
only
to
assert
the
crown
civil
authority
over
the
temporalities
of
the
church
but
to
exclude
definitely
all
jurisdiction
on
the
part
of
the
pope
it
is
the
assertion
of
a
principle
cromwell
said
to
him
when
he
asked
one
day
for
an
explanation
a
principle
that
has
always
been
held
in
england
it
is
not
intended
to
be
precise
or
detailed
that
will
follow
later
ralph
was
no
theologian
and
did
not
greatly
care
what
the
bill
did
or
did
not
involve
he
was
too
in
that
temper
of
inchoate
agnosticism
that
was
sweeping
england
at
the
time
and
any
scruples
that
he
had
in
his
more
superstitious
moments
were
lulled
by
the
knowledge
that
the
clergy
had
acquiesced
what
appeared
more
important
to
him
than
any
on
the
exact
provinces
of
the
various
authorities
in
question
was
the
necessity
of
some
step
towards
the
crippling
of
the
spiritual
empire
whose
hands
were
so
heavy
and
whose
demands
so
imperious
he
felt
as
an
englishman
resentful
of
the
leading
strings
in
which
so
it
seemed
to
him
rome
wished
to
fetter
his
country
the
bill
passed
through
parliament
on
november
the
eighteenth
ralph
lost
no
opportunity
of
impressing
upon
beatrice
how
much
he
had
risked
for
the
sake
of
her
friend
in
the
tower
and
drew
very
moving
sketches
of
his
own
peril
the
two
were
sitting
together

hall
at

was
relieved
by
lines
of
greenery
with
red
berries
here
and
there
a
bunch
of
mistletoe
leaned
forward
over
the
sloping
mantelpiece
and
there
was
an
acrid
smell
of
holly
and
laurel
in
the
air
it
was
a
little
piteous
ralph
thought
under
the
circumstances
another
stage
had
been
passed
in
more
journey
towards
death
in
the
previous
month
when
he
had
been
attainted
of
misprision
of
treason
by
an
act
designed
to
make
good
the
illegality
of
his
former
conviction
and
the
end
was
beginning
to
loom
clear
i
said
it
would
be
no
use
mistress
beatrice
and
it
is
none
master
cromwell
will
not
hear
a
word
beatrice
looked
up
at
ralph
and
down
again
as
her
manner
was
her
hands
were
lying
on
her
lap
perfectly
still
as
she
sat
upright
in
her
tall
chair
you
have
done
what
you
could
i
know
she
said
softly
master
cromwell
did
not
take
it
very
well
went
on
ralph
with
an
appearance
of
resolute
composure
but
that
was
to
be
expected
again
she
looked
up
and
ralph
once
more
was
seized
with
the
desire
to
precipitate
matters
and
tell
her
what
was
in
his
heart
but
he
repressed
it
knowing
it
was
useless
to
speak
yet
it
was
a
very
stately
and
slow
wooing
like
the
movement
of
a
minuet
each
postured
to
each
not
from
any
insincerity
except
perhaps
a
little
now
and
then
on
ralph
side
but
because
for
both
it
was
a
natural
mode
of
it
was
an
age
of
dignity
abruptly
broken
here
and
there
by
violence
there
were
slow
and
gorgeous
pageants
followed
by
brutal
and
bestial
scenes
like
the
life
of
a
peacock
who
paces
composedly
in
the
sun
and
then
scuttles
and
screams
in
the
evening
but
with
these
two
at
present
there
was
no
occasion
for
abruptness
and
ralph
at
any
rate
contemplated
with
complacency
his
own
graciousness
and
grandeur
and
the
skilfully
posed
tableaux
in
which
he
took
such
a
sedate
part
as
the
spring
drew
on
and
the
crocuses
began
to
star
the
grass
along
the
river
and
the
sun
to
wheel
wider
and
wider
the
chill
and
the
darkness
began
to
fall
more
heavily
on
the
household
at
chelsea
they
were
growing
very
poor
by
now
most
of
sir
thomas
possessions
elsewhere
had
been
confiscated
by
the
king
though
by
his
clemency
chelsea
was
still
left
to
alice
for
the
present
and
one
by
one
the
precious
things
began
to
disappear
from
the
house
as
they
were
sold
to
obtain
necessaries
all
the
private
fortune
of
more
had
gone
by
the
end
of
the
winter
and
her
son
still
owed
great
sums
to
the
government
on
behalf
of
his
father
at
the
beginning
of
may
she
told
ralph
that
she
was
making
another
appeal
to
cromwell
for
help
and
begged
him
to
forward
her
petition
my
silks
are
all
gone
she
said
and
the
little
gold
chain
and
cross
that
you
may
remember
torridon
went
last
month
too
i
can
not
tell
what
we
shall
do
more
is
so
obstinate
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
we
have
to
pay
fifteen
shillings
every
week
for
him
and
john
a
wood
she
looked
so
helpless
and
feeble
as
she
sat
in
the
window
seat
stripped
now
of
its
tapestry
cushions
with
the
roofs
of
the
new
building
rising
among
its
trees
at
the
back
where
her
husband
had
walked
a
year
ago
with
such
delight
that
ralph
felt
a
touch
of
compunction
and
promised
to
do
his
best
he
said
a
word
to
cromwell
that
evening
as
he
supped
with
him
at
hackney
and
his
master
looked
at
him
curiously
sitting
forward
in
the
carved
chair
he
had
had
from
wolsey
in
his
satin
gown
twisting
the
stem
of
his
german
glass
in
his
ringed
fingers
and
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
sir
he
asked
ralph
with
a
kind
of
pungent
irony
ralph
explained
that
he
scarcely
knew
himself
perhaps
a
word
to
his
grace
i
will
tell
you
what
it
is
torridon
broke
in
his
master
you
have
made
another
mistake
i
did
not
intend
you
to
be
their
friend
but
to
seem
so
i
can
scarcely
seem
so
said
ralph
quietly
but
with
a
certain
indignation
at
his
heart
unless
i
do
them
little
favours
sometimes
you
need
not
seem
so
any
longer
said
cromwell
drily
the
time
is
past
and
he
set
his
glass
down
and
sat
back
yet
ralph
respect
and
admiration
for
his
master
became
no
less
he
had
the
attractiveness
of
extreme
and
unscrupulous
capability
it
gave
ralph
the
same
joy
to
watch
him
as
he
found
in
looking
on
at
an
expert
fencer
he
was
so
adroit
and
strong
and
ready
mighty
and
patient
in
defence
watchful
for
opportunities
of
attack
and
merciless
when
they
came
his
admirers
scarcely
gave
a
thought
to
the
piteousness
of
the
adversary
they
were
absorbed
in
the
scheme
and
proud
to
be
included
in
it
and
men
of
heart
and
sensibility
were
as
hard
as
their
master
when
they
carried
out
his
plans
the
fate
of
the
carthusians
would
have
touched
ralph
if
he
had
been
a
mere
onlooker
as
it
touched
so
many
others
but
he
had
to
play
his
part
in
the
tragedy
and
was
astonished
at
the
quick
perceptions
of
cromwell
and
his
determined
brutality
towards
these
peaceful
contemplatives
whom
he
recognised
as
a
against
the
king
policy
he
was
present
first
in
cromwell
house
when
the
three
carthusian
priors
of
beauvale
axholme
and
london
called
upon
him
of
their
own
accord
to
put
their
questions
on
the
meaning
of
the
king
supremacy
but
their
first
question
as
to
how
was
it
possible
for
a
layman
to
hold
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
was
enough
and
without
any
further
evidence
they
were
sent
to
the
tower
then
again
he
was
present
in
the
court
of
the
rolls
a
few
days
later
when
dom
laurence
of
beauvale
and
dom
webster
of
axholme
were
examined
once
more
there
were
seven
or
eight
others
present
laymen
and
ecclesiastics
and
the
priors
were
once
more
sent
back
to
the
tower
and
so
examination
after
examination
went
on
and
no
answer
could
be
got
out
of
the
monks
but
that
they
could
never
reconcile
it
with
their
conscience
to
accept
the
king
to
be
what
the
act
of
supremacy
declared
that
he
was
ralph
curiosity
took
him
down
to
the
charterhouse
one
day
shortly
before
the
execution
of
the
priors
he
had
with
him
an
order
from
cromwell
that
carried
him
everywhere
he
wished
to
go
but
he
did
not
penetrate
too
deeply
he
was
astonished
at
the
impression
that
the
place
made
on
him
as
he
passed
up
the
great
cloister
there
was
no
sound
but
from
a
bird
or
two
singing
in
the
afternoon
sunlight
of
the
garth
each
with
its
hatch
for
the
passage
of
food
was
closed
and
silent
and
ralph
felt
a
curious
quickening
of
his
heart
as
he
thought
of
the
human
life
passed
in
the
little
houses
each
with
its
tiny
garden
its
workshop
its
two
rooms
and
its
paved
ambulatory
in
which
each
solitary
lived
how
strangely
apart
this
place
was
from
the
buzz
of
business
from
which
he
had
come
and
yet
he
knew
very
well
that
the
whole
was
as
good
as
condemned
already
he
wondered
to
himself
how
they
had
taken
the
news
of
the
tragedy
that
was
beginning
those
white
demure
men
with
shaved
heads
and
faces
and
downcast
eyes
he
reflected
what
the
effect
of
that
news
must
be
as
it
penetrated
each
day
like
a
stone
dropped
softly
into
a
pool
leaving
no
ripple
there
behind
each
brown
door
he
fancied
to
himself
a
strange
alchemy
was
proceeding
in
which
each
new
terror
and
threat
from
outside
was
received
into
the
crucible
of
a
beating
heart
and
transmuted
by
prayer
and
welcome
into
some
wonderful
jewel
of
glory
at
least
so
these
poor
men
believed
and
ralph
indignantly
told
himself
it
was
nonsense
they
were
idlers
and
dreamers
he
reminded
himself
of
a
sneer
he
had
heard
against
the
barrels
of
spanish
wine
that
were
taken
in
week
by
week
at
the
monastery
door
if
these
men
ate
no
flesh
too
at
least
they
had
excellent
omelettes
but
as
he
passed
at
last
through
the
choir
and
stood
looking
through
the
gates
of
the
fathers
choir
up
to
the
rich
altar
with
its
hangings
and
its
posts
on
either
side
crowned
with
gilded
angels
bearing
candles
to
the
splendid
window
overhead
against
which
as
in
a
glory
hung
the
motionless
pyx
the
awe
fell
on
him
again
this
was
the
place
where
they
met
these
strange
silent
men
every
panel
and
stone
was
saturated
with
the
prayers
of
experts
offered
three
times
a
day
in
the
of
two
or
three
hours
when
the
world
was
asleep
at
the
and
at
vespers
in
the
afternoon
his
heart
again
stirred
a
little
superstitiously
he
angrily
told
himself
at
the
memory
of
the
stories
that
were
whispered
about
in
town
two
years
ago
men
said
a
comet
had
been
seen
shining
over
the
house
as
the
monks
went
back
from
matins
each
with
his
lantern
in
his
hand
along
the
dark
cloister
a
ray
had
shot
out
from
the
comet
had
glowed
upon
the
church
and
and
died
again
into
darkness
again
a
little
later
two
monks
one
in
his
and
the
other
in
the
cemetery
had
seen
a
globe
high
and
menacing
hanging
in
the
air
over
the
house
lastly
at
pentecost
at
the
mass
of
the
holy
ghost
offered
at
the
end
of
a
triduum
with
the
intention
of
winning
grace
to
meet
any
sacrifice
that
might
be
demanded
not
one
nor
two
but
the
whole
community
including
the
outside
the
fathers
choir
had
perceived
a
soft
whisper
of
music
of
inexpressible
sweetness
that
came
and
went
overhead
at
the
elevation
the
celebrant
bowed
forward
in
silence
over
the
altar
unable
to
continue
the
mass
the
monks
remained
petrified
with
joy
and
awe
in
their
stalls
ralph
stared
once
more
at
the
altar
as
he
remembered
this
tale
at
the
row
of
stalls
on
either
side
the
dark
roof
overhead
the
glowing
glass
on
either
side
and
in
front
and
asked
himself
whether
it
was
true
whether
god
had
spoken
whether
a
chink
of
the
heavenly
gate
had
been
opened
here
to
let
the
music
escape
it
was
not
true
he
told
himself
it
was
the
dream
of
a
man
mad
with
sleeplessness
foolish
with
fasting
and
discipline
and
vigils
one
had
dreamed
it
and
babbled
of
it
to
the
rest
and
none
had
liked
to
be
less
spiritual
or
perceptive
of
divine
manifestations
a
brown
figure
was
by
the
altar
now
to
light
the
candles
for
vespers
a
taper
was
in
his
hand
and
the
spot
of
light
at
the
end
moved
like
a
star
against
the
gilding
and
carving
ralph
turned
and
went
out
then
on
the
fourth
of
may
he
was
present
at
the
execution
of
the
three
priors
and
the
two
other
priests
at
tyburn
there
was
an
immense
crowd
there
nearly
the
whole
court
being
present
and
it
was
reported
here
and
there
afterwards
that
the
king
himself
was
there
in
a
group
of
five
horsemen
who
came
in
the
accoutrements
of
borderers
vizored
and
armed
and
took
up
their
position
close
to
the
scaffold
there
fell
a
terrible
silence
as
the
monks
were
dragged
up
on
the
hurdles
in
their
habits
all
three
together
behind
one
horse
they
were
cut
down
almost
at
once
and
the
butchery
was
performed
on
them
while
they
were
still
alive
ralph
went
home
in
a
glow
of
resolution
against
them
a
tragedy
such
as
that
which
he
had
seen
was
of
necessity
a
violent
motive
one
way
or
the
other
and
it
found
him
determined
that
the
sufferers
were
in
the
wrong
and
left
him
confirmed
in
his
determination
their
very
passivity
enraged
him
meanwhile
he
had
of
course
heard
nothing
of
his
brother
presence
in
london
and
it
was
with
something
of
a
shock
that
on
the
next
afternoon
he
heard
the
news
from
morris
that
christopher
was
below
and
waiting
for
him
in
the
parlour
as
he
went
down
he
wondered
what
chris
was
doing
in
london
and
what
he
himself
could
say
to
him
he
was
expecting
beatrice
too
to
call
upon
him
presently
with
her
maid
to
give
him
a
message
and
a
bundle
of
letters
which
he
had
promised
to
convey
to
sir
thomas
more
but
he
was
determined
to
be
kind
to
his
brother
chris
was
standing
in
his
black
monk
habit
on
the
other
side
of
the
walnut
table
beside
the
and
made
no
movement
as
ralph
came
forward
smiling
and
composed
his
face
was
thinner
than
his
brother
remembered
it
now
with
hollows
in
the
checks
and
his
eyes
were
strangely
light
why
chris
said
ralph
and
stopped
astonished
at
the
motionlessness
then
chris
came
round
the
table
with
a
couple
of
swift
steps
his
hands
raised
a
little
from
the
wide
drooping
sleeves
ah
brother
he
said
i
have
come
to
bring
you
away
this
is
a
wicked
place
ralph
was
so
amazed
that
he
fell
back
a
step
are
you
mad
he
said
coldly
enough
but
he
felt
a
twitch
of
superstitious
fear
at
his
heart
chris
seized
the
rich
silk
sleeve
in
both
his
hands
and
ralph
felt
them
trembling
and
nervous
you
must
come
away
he
said
for
jesu
sake
brother
you
must
not
lose
your
soul
ralph
felt
the
old
contempt
surge
up
and
drown
his
fear
the
familiarity
of
his
brother
presence
weighed
down
the
religious
suggestion
of
his
habit
and
office
this
is
what
he
had
feared
and
almost
expected
that
the
cloister
would
make
a
fanatic
of
this
fantastic
brother
of
his
he
glanced
round
at
the
door
that
he
had
left
open
but
the
house
was
silent
then
he
turned
again
sit
down
chris
he
said
with
a
strong
effort
at
and
he
pulled
his
sleeve
away
went
back
and
shut
the
door
and
then
came
forward
past
where
his
brother
was
standing
to
the
chair
that
stood
with
its
back
to
the
window
you
must
not
be
fond
and
wild
he
said
decidedly
sit
down
chris
the
monk
came
past
him
to
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
and
faced
him
again
but
did
not
sit
down
he
remained
standing
by
the
looking
down
at
ralph
who
was
in
his
chair
with
crossed
legs
what
is
this
folly
said
ralph
again
chris
stared
down
at
him
a
moment
in
silence
why
why
he
began
and
ceased
ralph
felt
himself
the
master
of
the
situation
and
determined
to
be
paternal
my
dear
lad
he
said
you
have
dreamed
yourself
mad
at
lewes
when
did
you
come
to
london
yesterday
said
chris
still
with
that
strange
stare
why
then
began
ralph
yes
you
think
i
was
too
late
but
i
saw
it
said
chris
i
was
there
in
the
evening
and
saw
it
all
again
all
his
nervous
tension
seemed
relaxed
by
the
warm
atmosphere
of
this
trim
little
room
and
his
brother
composure
his
lips
were
beginning
to
tremble
and
he
half
turned
and
gripped
the
with
his
right
hand
ralph
noticed
with
a
kind
of
contemptuous
pity
how
the
heavy
girded
folds
of
the
frock
seemed
to
contain
nothing
and
that
the
wrist
from
which
the
sleeve
had
fallen
back
was
slender
as
a
reed
ralph
felt
himself
so
infinitely
his
brother
superior
that
he
could
afford
to
be
generous
and
kindly
dear
chris
he
said
smiling
you
look
starved
and
miserable
shall
i
tell
morris
to
bring
you
something
i
thought
you
monks
fared
better
than
that
in
a
moment
chris
was
on
his
knees
on
the
rushes
his
hands
gripped
his
brother
arms
and
his
wild
eyes
were
staring
up
with
a
fanatical
fire
of
entreaty
in
them
his
words
broke
out
like
a
torrent
ralph
he
said
dear
brother
for
jesu
sake
come
away
i
have
heard
everything
i
know
that
these
streets
are
red
with
blood
and
that
your
hands
have
been
dipped
in
it
you
must
not
lose
your
soul
i
know
everything
you
must
come
away
for
jesu
sake
ralph
tore
himself
free
and
stood
up
pushing
back
his
chair
godbody
he
said
i
have
a
fool
for
a
brother
stand
up
sir
i
will
have
no
mumming
in
my
house
he
rapped
his
foot
fiercely
on
the
floor
staring
down
at
chris
who
had
thrown
himself
back
on
his
heels
stand
up
sir
he
said
again
will
you
hear
me
brother
ralph
hesitated
i
will
hear
you
if
you
will
talk
reason
i
think
you
are
mad
chris
got
up
again
he
was
trembling
violently
and
his
hands
twitched
and
clenched
by
his
sides
then
you
shall
hear
me
he
said
and
his
voice
shook
as
he
spoke
it
is
this
you
must
sit
down
interrupted
ralph
and
he
pointed
to
the
chair
behind
chris
went
to
it
and
sat
down
ralph
took
a
step
across
to
the
door
and
opened
it
morris
he
called
and
came
back
to
his
chair
there
was
silence
a
moment
or
two
till
the
servant
step
sounded
in
the
hall
and
the
door
opened
morris
discreet
face
looked
steadily
and
composedly
at
his
master
bring
the
pasty
said
ralph
and
the
wine
he
gave
the
servant
a
sharp
look
seemed
to
glance
out
across
the
hall
for
a
moment
and
back
again
there
was
no
answering
look
on
face
but
he
slipped
out
softly
leaving
the
door
just
ajar
then
ralph
turned
to
chris
again
chris
had
had
time
to
recover
himself
by
now
and
was
sitting
very
pale
and
composed
after
his
dramatic
outburst
his
hands
hidden
under
his
scapular
and
his
fingers
gripped
together
now
tell
me
said
ralph
with
his
former
kindly
contempt
he
had
begun
to
understand
now
what
his
brother
had
come
about
and
was
determined
to
be
at
once
fatherly
and
decisive
this
young
fool
must
be
taught
his
place
it
is
this
said
chris
still
in
a
trembling
voice
but
it
grew
steadier
as
he
went
on
god
people
are
being
persecuted
there
is
no
longer
any
doubt
they
were
saints
who
died
yesterday
and
master
cromwell
is
behind
it
all
and
and
you
serve
him
ralph
jerked
his
head
to
speak
but
his
brother
went
on
i
know
you
think
me
a
fool
and
i
daresay
you
are
right
but
this
i
know
i
would
sooner
be
a
fool
than
than
than
a
knave
ended
ralph
i
thank
you
for
your
good
opinion
my
brother
however
let
that
pass
you
have
come
to
teach
me
my
business
then
i
have
come
to
save
your
soul
said
chris
grasping
the
arms
of
his
chair
and
eyeing
him
steadily
you
are
very
good
to
me
said
ralph
bitterly
now
i
do
not
want
any
more
he
broke
off
suddenly
as
the
door
opened
and
here
is
the
food
chris
you
are
not
yourself
he
gave
a
swift
look
at
his
servant
again
and
i
suppose
you
have
had
no
food
again
he
glanced
out
through
the
open
door
as
morris
turned
to
go
chris
paid
no
sort
of
attention
to
the
food
he
seemed
not
to
have
seen
the
servant
entrance
and
departure
i
tell
you
he
said
again
steadily
with
his
wide
bright
eyes
fixed
on
his
brother
i
tell
you
you
are
persecuting
god
people
and
i
am
come
not
as
your
brother
only
but
as
a
monk
to
warn
you
ralph
waved
his
hand
smiling
towards
the
dish
and
the
bottle
it
seemed
to
sting
chris
with
a
kind
of
fury
for
his
eyes
blazed
and
his
mouth
tightened
as
he
stood
up
abruptly
i
tell
you
that
if
i
were
starving
i
would
not
break
bread
in
this
house
it
is
the
house
of
god
enemy
he
dashed
out
his
left
hand
nervously
and
struck
the
bottle
spinning
across
the
table
it
crashed
over
on
to
the
floor
and
the
red
wine
poured
on
to
the
boards
why
there
is
blood
before
your
eyes
he
screamed
mad
with
hunger
and
sleeplessness
and
the
horrors
he
had
seen
the
ground
cries
out
ralph
had
sprung
up
as
the
bottle
fell
and
stood
trembling
and
glaring
across
at
the
monk
the
door
opened
softly
and
morris
stood
alert
and
discreet
on
the
threshold
but
neither
saw
him
and
if
you
were
ten
times
my
brother
cried
chris
i
would
not
touch
your
hand
there
came
a
knocking
at
the
door
and
the
servant
disappeared
let
him
come
if
it
be
the
king
himself
shouted
the
monk
and
hear
the
truth
for
once
the
servant
was
pushed
aside
protesting
and
beatrice
came
straight
forward
into
the
room
chapter
xii
a
recovery
there
was
a
moment
of
intense
silence
only
emphasized
by
the
settling
rustle
of
the
girl
dress
the
door
had
closed
softly
and
morris
stood
within
in
the
shadow
by
the
window
ready
to
give
help
if
it
were
needed
beatrice
remained
a
yard
inside
the
room
very
upright
and
dignified
a
little
pale
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
two
brothers
who
stared
back
at
her
as
at
a
ghost
ralph
spoke
first
swallowing
once
or
twice
in
his
throat
before
speaking
and
trying
to
smile
it
is
you
then
he
said
beatrice
moved
a
step
nearer
looking
at
chris
who
stood
white
and
tense
his
eyes
wide
and
burning
torridon
said
beatrice
softly
i
have
brought
the
bundle
my
woman
has
it
still
she
looked
as
she
spoke
questioningly
at
chris
oh
this
is
my
brother
the
monk
snapped
ralph
bitterly
glancing
at
him
indeed
he
is
then
chris
lost
his
again
and
this
is
my
brother
the
murderer
indeed
he
is
beatrice
lips
parted
and
her
eyes
winced
she
put
out
her
hand
hesitatingly
towards
ralph
and
dropped
it
again
as
he
moved
a
little
towards
her
you
hear
him
said
ralph
i
do
not
understand
said
the
girl
your
brother
yes
i
am
his
brother
god
help
me
snarled
chris
beatrice
lips
closed
again
and
a
look
of
contempt
came
into
her
face
i
have
heard
enough
torridon
will
you
come
with
me
chris
moved
forward
a
step
i
do
not
know
who
you
are
madam
he
said
but
do
you
understand
what
this
gentleman
is
do
you
know
that
he
is
a
creature
of
master
cromwell
i
know
everything
said
beatrice
and
you
were
at
tyburn
too
questioned
chris
bitterly
perhaps
with
this
brother
of
mine
beatrice
faced
him
defiantly
what
have
you
to
say
against
him
sir
ralph
made
a
movement
to
speak
but
the
girl
checked
him
i
wish
to
hear
it
what
have
you
to
say
he
is
a
creature
of
cromwell
who
plotted
the
death
of
god
saints
this
brother
of
mine
was
at
the
examinations
i
hear
and
at
the
scaffold
is
that
enough
chris
had
himself
under
control
again
by
now
but
his
words
seemed
to
burn
with
vitriol
his
lips
writhed
as
he
spoke
well
said
beatrice
well
if
that
is
not
enough
how
of
more
and
my
lord
of
rochester
he
has
been
a
good
friend
to
more
said
beatrice
that
i
know
he
will
get
him
the
martyr
crown
surely
sneered
chris
and
you
have
no
more
to
say
asked
the
girl
quietly
a
shudder
ran
over
the
monk
body
his
mouth
opened
and
closed
and
the
fire
in
his
eyes
flared
up
and
died
his
clenched
hands
rose
and
fell
then
he
spoke
quietly
i
have
no
more
to
say
madam
beatrice
moved
across
to
ralph
and
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
looking
steadily
at
chris
ralph
laid
his
other
hand
on
hers
a
moment
then
raised
it
and
made
an
abrupt
motion
towards
the
door
chris
went
round
the
table
morris
opened
the
door
with
an
impassive
face
and
followed
him
out
leaving
beatrice
and
ralph
alone
chris
had
come
back
the
previous
evening
from
tyburn
distracted
almost
to
madness
he
had
sat
heavily
all
the
evening
by
himself
brooding
and
miserable
and
had
not
slept
all
night
but
waking
visions
had
moved
continually
before
his
eyes
as
he
turned
to
and
fro
on
his
narrow
bed
in
the
unfamiliar
room
again
and
again
tyburn
was
before
him
peopled
with
phantoms
he
had
seen
the
thick
ropes
and
heard
their
creaking
and
the
murmur
of
the
multitude
had
smelt
the
pungent
and
the
thick
drifting
vapour
from
the
cauldron
once
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
very
room
was
full
of
figures
and
silent
who
watched
him
with
impassive
pale
faces
remote
and
unconcerned
he
had
flung
himself
on
his
knees
again
and
again
had
lashed
himself
with
the
discipline
that
he
too
might
taste
of
pain
but
all
the
serenity
of
divine
things
was
gone
there
was
no
heaven
no
saviour
no
love
he
was
bound
down
here
crushed
and
stifled
in
this
apostate
city
whose
sounds
and
cries
came
up
into
his
cell
he
had
lost
the
fiery
vision
of
the
conqueror
welcome
it
was
like
a
tale
heard
long
ago
now
he
was
beaten
down
by
physical
facts
by
the
gross
details
of
the
tragedy
the
strangling
the
blood
the
smoke
the
acrid
smell
of
the
crowd
and
heaven
was
darkened
by
the
vapour
it
was
not
until
the
next
day
as
he
sat
with
the
prior
and
a
stranger
or
two
and
heard
the
tale
once
more
and
the
predictions
about
more
and
fisher
that
the
significance
of
ralph
position
appeared
to
him
clearly
he
knew
no
more
than
before
but
he
suddenly
understood
what
he
knew
a
monk
had
said
a
word
of
cromwell
share
in
the
matters
and
the
prior
had
glanced
moodily
at
chris
for
a
moment
turning
his
eyes
only
as
he
sat
with
his
chin
in
his
hand
and
in
a
moment
chris
understood
this
was
the
work
that
his
brother
was
doing
he
sat
now
more
distracted
than
ever
mental
pictures
moved
before
him
of
strange
with
great
men
in
silk
on
raised
seats
and
ralph
was
among
them
he
seemed
to
hear
his
bitter
questions
that
pierced
to
the
root
of
the
faith
of
the
accused
and
exposed
it
to
the
world
of
their
adherence
to
the
vicar
of
christ
their
uncompromising
convictions
he
had
sat
through
dinner
with
burning
eyes
but
the
prior
noticed
nothing
for
he
himself
was
in
a
passion
of
absorption
and
gave
chris
a
hasty
leave
as
he
rose
from
table
to
go
and
see
his
brother
if
he
wished
chris
had
walked
up
and
down
his
room
that
afternoon
framing
sentences
of
appeal
and
pity
and
terror
but
it
was
useless
he
could
not
fix
his
mind
and
he
had
gone
off
at
last
to
westminster
at
once
terrified
for
ralph
soul
and
blazing
with
indignation
against
him
and
now
he
was
walking
down
to
the
river
again
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
knowing
that
he
had
ruined
his
own
cause
and
his
right
to
speak
by
his
intemperate
fury
it
was
another
strange
evening
that
he
passed
in
the
prior
chamber
after
supper
the
same
monk
dom
odo
who
had
taken
him
to
tyburn
the
day
before
was
there
again
and
chris
sat
in
a
corner
with
the
reaction
of
his
fury
on
him
spent
and
feverish
now
rehearsing
the
scene
he
had
gone
through
with
ralph
and
framing
new
sentences
that
he
might
have
used
now
listening
to
the
talk
and
vaguely
gathering
its
meaning
it
seemed
that
the
tale
of
blood
was
only
begun
bedale
the
archdeacon
of
cornwall
had
gone
that
day
to
the
charterhouse
he
had
been
seen
driving
there
and
getting
out
at
the
door
with
a
bundle
of
books
under
his
arm
and
he
had
passed
in
through
the
gate
over
which
prior
houghton
arm
had
been
hung
on
the
previous
evening
it
was
expected
that
some
more
arrests
would
be
made
immediately
as
for
my
lord
of
rochester
said
the
monk
who
seemed
to
revel
in
the
business
of
bearing
bad
news
and
master
more
i
make
no
doubt
they
will
be
cast
they
are
utterly
fixed
in
their
opinions
i
hear
that
my
lord
is
very
sick
and
i
pray
that
god
may
take
him
to
himself
he
is
made
cardinal
in
rome
i
hear
but
his
grace
has
sworn
that
he
shall
have
no
head
to
wear
the
hat
upon
then
he
went
off
into
talk
upon
the
bishop
describing
his
sufferings
in
the
tower
for
he
was
over
eighty
years
old
and
had
scarcely
sufficient
clothes
to
cover
him
now
and
again
chris
looked
across
at
his
superior
the
prior
sat
there
in
his
great
chair
his
head
on
his
hand
silent
and
absorbed
it
was
only
when
dom
odo
stopped
for
a
moment
that
he
glanced
up
impatiently
and
nodded
for
him
to
go
on
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
hear
enough
and
yet
chris
saw
him
wince
and
heard
him
breathe
sharply
as
each
new
detail
came
out
the
monk
told
them
too
of
prior
houghton
speech
upon
the
cart
they
asked
him
whether
even
then
he
would
submit
to
the
king
laws
and
he
called
god
to
witness
that
it
was
not
for
obstinacy
or
perversity
that
he
refused
but
that
the
king
and
the
parliament
had
decreed
otherwise
than
our
holy
mother
enjoins
and
that
for
himself
he
would
sooner
suffer
every
kind
of
pain
than
deny
a
doctrine
of
the
church
and
when
he
had
prayed
from
the
thirtieth
psalm
he
was
turned
off
the
prior
stared
almost
vacantly
at
the
monk
who
told
his
story
with
a
kind
of
terrified
gusto
and
once
or
twice
his
lips
moved
to
speak
but
he
was
silent
and
dropped
his
chin
upon
his
hand
again
when
the
other
had
done
chris
scarcely
knew
how
the
days
passed
away
that
followed
his
arrival
in
london
he
spent
them
for
the
most
part
within
doors
writing
for
the
prior
in
the
mornings
or
keeping
watch
over
the
door
as
his
superior
talked
with
prelates
and
churchmen
within
for
ecclesiastical
london
was
as
busy
as
a
broken
and
men
came
and
went
continually
scared
furtive
monks
who
looked
this
way
and
that
an
abbot
or
two
up
for
the
house
of
lords
priors
and
procurators
on
business
there
were
continual
communications
going
to
and
fro
among
the
religious
houses
for
the
prince
of
them
the
contemplative
carthusian
had
been
struck
at
and
no
one
knew
where
the
assault
would
end
meanwhile
chris
had
heard
no
further
news
from
ralph
he
thought
of
writing
to
him
and
even
of
visiting
him
again
but
his
heart
sickened
at
the
thought
of
it
it
was
impossible
he
told
himself
that
any
communication
should
pass
between
them
until
his
brother
had
forsaken
his
horrible
business
the
first
sign
of
regret
must
come
from
the
one
who
had
sinned
he
wondered
sometimes
who
the
girl
was
and
as
a
monk
suspected
the
worst
a
man
who
could
live
as
ralph
was
living
could
have
no
morals
left
she
had
been
so
friendly
with
him
so
ready
to
defend
him
so
impatient
chris
thought
of
any
possibility
of
wrong
no
doubt
she
too
was
one
of
the
corrupt
band
one
of
the
great
ladies
that
buzzed
round
the
court
and
sucked
the
blood
of
people
his
own
interior
life
however
so
roughly
broken
by
his
new
experiences
began
to
mend
slowly
as
the
days
went
on
he
had
begun
like
a
cat
in
a
new
house
to
make
himself
slowly
at
home
in
the
hostel
and
to
set
up
that
relation
between
outward
objects
and
his
own
self
that
is
so
necessary
to
interior
souls
not
yet
living
in
detachment
he
arranged
his
little
room
next
the
prior
to
be
as
much
as
possible
like
his
cell
got
rid
of
one
or
two
pieces
of
furniture
that
distracted
him
set
his
bed
in
another
corner
and
hung
up
his
beads
in
the
same
position
that
they
used
to
occupy
at
lewes
each
morning
he
served
the
prior
mass
in
the
tiny
chapel
attached
to
the
house
and
did
his
best
both
then
and
at
his
meditation
to
draw
in
the
torn
fibres
of
his
spirit
at
moments
of
worship
the
supernatural
world
began
to
appear
again
like
points
of
living
rock
emerging
through
sand
detached
and
half
stifled
by
external
details
but
real
and
abiding
little
by
little
his
serenity
came
back
and
the
old
atmosphere
reasserted
itself
after
all
god
was
here
as
there
grace
penance
the
guardianship
of
the
angels
and
the
sacrament
of
the
altar
was
the
same
at
southwark
as
at
lewes
these
things
remained
while
all
else
was
accidental
the
different
height
of
his
room
the
unfamiliar
angles
in
the
passages
the
new
noises
of
london
the
street
cries
the
clash
of
music
the
disordered
routine
of
daily
life
through
june
after
a
long
morning
conversation
with
a
stranger
the
prior
sent
for
him
he
was
standing
by
the
tall
carved
with
his
back
to
the
door
his
head
and
one
hand
leaning
against
the
stone
and
he
turned
round
despondently
as
chris
came
in
chris
could
see
he
was
deadly
pale
and
that
his
lips
twitched
with
nervousness
brother
he
said
i
have
a
perilous
matter
to
go
through
and
you
must
come
with
me
chris
felt
his
heart
begin
to
labour
with
heavy
sick
beats
i
am
to
see
my
lord
of
rochester
a
friend
hath
obtained
the
order
we
are
to
go
at
five
see
that
you
be
ready
we
shall
take
boat
at
the
stairs
chris
waited
with
his
eyes
deferentially
cast
down
he
is
to
be
tried
again
on
thursday
went
on
the
prior
and
my
friends
wish
me
to
see
him
god
knows
he
stopped
abruptly
made
a
sign
with
his
hand
and
as
chris
left
the
room
he
saw
that
he
was
leaning
once
more
against
the
and
that
his
head
was
buried
in
his
arms
three
more
carthusians
had
been
condemned
in
the
previous
week
but
the
bishop
trial
though
his
name
was
in
the
first
indictment
was
postponed
a
few
days
he
too
like
sir
thomas
more
had
been
over
a
year
in
the
tower
he
had
been
deprived
of
his
see
by
an
act
of
parliament
his
palace
had
been
broken
into
and
spoiled
and
he
himself
it
was
reported
was
being
treated
with
the
greatest
rigour
in
the
tower
chris
was
overcome
with
excitement
at
the
thought
that
he
was
to
see
this
man
he
had
heard
of
his
learning
his
holiness
and
his
austerities
on
all
hands
since
his
coming
to
london
when
the
bishop
had
left
rochester
at
his
summons
to
london
a
year
before
there
had
been
a
wonderful
scene
of
farewell
of
which
the
story
was
still
told
in
town
the
streets
had
been
thronged
with
a
vast
crowd
weeping
and
praying
as
he
rode
among
them
giving
his
blessing
as
he
went
he
had
checked
his
horse
by
the
and
with
a
loud
voice
had
bidden
them
all
stand
by
the
old
religion
and
let
no
man
take
it
from
them
and
now
here
he
lay
himself
in
prison
for
the
faith
a
cardinal
of
the
holy
roman
church
with
scarcely
clothes
to
cover
him
or
food
to
eat
at
the
sacking
of
his
palace
too
as
the
men
ran
from
room
to
room
tearing
down
the
tapestries
and
piling
the
plate
together
a
monk
had
found
a
great
iron
box
hidden
in
a
corner
they
cried
to
one
another
that
it
held
gold
for
the
bloody
pope
and
burst
it
open
to
find
a
hair
shirt
and
a
pair
of
disciplines
it
was
a
long
row
down
to
the
tower
from
southwark
against
the
tide
as
they
passed
beneath
the
bridge
chris
stared
up
at
the
crowding
houses
the
great
gates
at
either
end
and
the
faces
craning
down
and
he
caught
one
glimpse
as
they
shot
through
the
narrow
passage
between
the
piers
of
the
tall
wall
above
the
gate
the
poles
rising
from
it
and
the
severed
heads
that
crowned
them
somewhere
among
that
forest
of
grim
stems
the
carthusian
priors
looked
down
as
he
turned
in
his
seat
he
saw
the
boatman
grinning
to
himself
and
following
his
eyes
observed
the
prior
beside
him
with
a
white
fixed
face
looking
steadily
downwards
towards
his
feet
they
found
no
difficulty
when
they
landed
at
the
stairs
and
showed
the
order
at
the
gate
the
warder
called
to
a
man
within
the
who
came
out
and
went
before
them
along
the
walled
way
that
led
to
the
inner
ward
they
turned
up
to
the
left
presently
and
found
themselves
in
the
great
court
that
surrounded
the
white
tower
the
prior
walked
heavily
with
his
face
downcast
as
if
he
wished
to
avoid
notice
and
chris
saw
that
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
and
other
persons
here
and
there
who
saluted
his
prelate
insignia
there
were
plenty
of
people
going
about
in
the
evening
sunshine
soldiers
and
attendants
and
here
and
there
at
the
foot
of
a
tower
stood
a
halberdier
in
his
buff
jacket
leaning
on
his
weapon
there
were
many
distinguished
persons
in
the
tower
now
both
ecclesiastics
and
laymen
who
had
refused
to
take
one
or
both
of
the
oaths
and
chris
eyed
the
windows
wonderingly
picturing
to
himself
where
each
lay
and
with
what
courage
but
more
and
more
as
he
went
he
wondered
why
the
prior
and
he
were
here
and
who
had
obtained
the
order
of
admittance
for
he
had
not
had
a
sight
of
it
when
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
the
warder
said
a
word
to
the
sentry
and
took
the
two
monks
straight
past
preceding
them
up
the
narrow
stairs
that
wound
into
darkness
there
were
windows
here
and
there
slits
in
the
heavy
masonry
through
which
chris
caught
glimpses
now
of
the
moat
on
the
west
now
of
the
inner
ward
with
the
white
tower
huge
and
massive
on
the
east
the
prior
who
went
behind
the
warder
and
in
front
of
chris
stopped
suddenly
and
chris
could
hear
him
whispering
to
himself
and
at
the
same
time
there
sounded
the
creaking
of
a
key
in
front
as
the
young
monk
stood
there
waiting
grasping
the
on
his
right
again
the
excitement
surged
up
and
with
it
was
mingled
something
of
terror
it
had
been
a
formidable
experience
even
to
walk
those
few
hundred
yards
from
the
outer
gate
and
the
obvious
apprehensiveness
of
the
prior
who
had
spoken
no
audible
word
since
they
had
landed
was
far
from
reassuring
here
he
stood
now
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
within
those
terrible
walls
he
had
seen
the
low
traitor
gate
on
his
way
that
was
for
so
many
the
gate
of
death
even
now
as
he
gripped
the
stone
he
could
see
out
to
the
left
through
the
narrow
slit
a
streak
of
open
land
beyond
the
moat
and
the
wall
and
somewhere
there
he
knew
lay
the
little
rising
ground
that
reddened
week
after
week
in
an
ooze
of
blood
and
slime
and
now
he
was
at
the
door
of
one
who
without
doubt
would
die
there
soon
for
the
faith
that
they
both
professed
the
prior
turned
sharply
round
you
he
said
i
had
forgotten
you
must
wait
here
till
i
call
you
in
there
was
a
sounding
of
an
opening
door
above
the
prior
went
up
and
forward
leaving
him
standing
there
the
door
closed
but
not
before
chris
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
vaulted
roof
and
then
the
warder
stood
by
him
again
waiting
with
his
keys
in
his
hand
chapter
xiii
prisoner
and
prince
the
sun
sank
lower
and
had
begun
to
throw
long
shadows
before
the
door
opened
again
and
the
prior
beckoned
as
chris
had
stood
there
staring
out
of
the
window
at
the
green
water
of
the
moat
and
the
shadowed
wall
beyond
with
the
warder
standing
a
few
steps
below
now
sighing
at
the
delay
now
humming
a
line
or
two
he
had
heard
voices
now
and
again
from
the
room
above
but
it
had
been
no
more
than
a
murmur
that
died
once
more
into
silence
chris
was
aware
of
a
dusty
room
as
he
stepped
over
the
threshold
bare
walls
one
or
two
solid
pieces
of
furniture
and
of
the
prior
figure
very
upright
in
the
light
from
the
tiny
window
at
one
side
and
then
he
forgot
everything
as
he
looked
at
the
man
that
was
standing
smiling
by
the
table
it
was
a
very
tall
slender
figure
dressed
in
a
ragged
black
gown
turning
green
with
age
a
little
bent
now
but
still
dignified
the
face
was
incredibly
lean
with
great
brown
eyes
surrounded
by
wrinkles
and
a
little
white
hair
ragged
too
and
long
hung
down
under
the
old
flapped
cap
the
hand
that
chris
kissed
seemed
a
bundle
of
reeds
bound
with
parchment
and
above
the
wrist
bones
the
arm
grew
thinner
still
under
the
loose
torn
sleeve
then
the
monk
stood
up
and
saw
those
kindly
proud
eyes
looking
into
his
own
the
prior
made
a
deferential
movement
and
said
a
word
or
two
and
the
bishop
answered
him
yes
yes
my
lord
prior
i
understand
god
bless
you
my
son
the
bishop
moved
across
to
the
chair
and
sat
down
panting
a
little
for
he
was
torn
by
sickness
and
deprivation
and
laid
his
long
hands
together
sit
down
brother
he
said
and
you
too
my
lord
prior
chris
saw
the
prior
move
across
to
an
old
broken
stool
but
he
himself
remained
standing
awed
and
almost
terrified
at
that
worn
face
in
which
the
eyes
alone
seemed
living
so
thin
that
the
cheekbones
stood
out
hideously
and
the
line
of
the
square
jaw
but
the
voice
was
wonderfully
sweet
and
penetrating
my
lord
prior
and
i
have
been
talking
of
the
times
and
what
is
best
to
be
done
and
how
we
must
all
be
faithful
you
will
be
faithful
brother
chris
made
an
effort
against
the
absorbing
fascination
of
that
face
and
voice
i
will
my
lord
that
is
good
you
must
follow
your
prior
and
be
obedient
to
him
you
will
find
him
wise
and
courageous
the
bishop
nodded
gently
towards
the
prior
and
chris
heard
a
sobbing
indrawn
breath
from
the
corner
where
the
broken
stool
stood
it
is
a
time
of
great
moment
went
on
the
bishop
much
hangs
on
how
we
carry
ourselves
his
grace
has
evil
counsellors
about
him
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
or
two
chris
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
the
bishop
face
the
frightful
framework
of
skin
and
bones
seemed
luminous
from
within
and
there
was
an
extraordinary
sweetness
on
those
tightly
drawn
lips
and
in
the
large
bright
eyes
his
grace
has
been
to
the
tower
lately
i
hear
and
once
to
the
marshalsea
to
see
dom
sebastian
newdegate
who
as
you
know
was
at
court
for
many
years
till
he
entered
the
charterhouse
but
i
have
had
no
visit
from
him
nor
yet
i
should
think
master
more
you
must
not
judge
his
grace
too
hardly
my
son
he
was
a
good
lad
as
i
knew
very
well
a
very
gallant
and
brave
lad
a
frenchman
said
that
he
seemed
to
have
come
down
from
heaven
and
he
has
always
had
a
great
faith
and
devotion
and
a
very
strange
and
delicate
conscience
that
has
cost
him
much
pain
but
he
has
been
counselled
evilly
chris
remembered
as
in
a
dream
that
the
bishop
had
been
the
king
tutor
years
before
he
is
a
good
theologian
too
went
on
the
bishop
and
that
is
his
misfortune
now
though
i
never
thought
to
say
such
a
thing
perhaps
he
will
become
a
better
one
still
if
god
has
mercy
on
him
and
he
will
come
back
to
his
first
faith
but
we
must
be
good
catholics
ourselves
and
be
ready
to
die
for
our
religion
before
we
can
teach
him
again
after
another
silence
he
went
on
you
are
to
be
a
priest
i
hear
my
son
and
to
take
christ
yoke
more
closely
upon
you
it
is
no
easy
one
in
these
days
though
love
will
make
it
so
as
himself
said
i
suppose
it
will
be
soon
now
we
are
to
get
a
dispensation
my
lord
for
the
interstices
said
the
prior
chris
had
heard
that
this
would
be
done
before
he
left
lewes
and
he
was
astonished
now
not
at
the
news
but
at
the
strange
softness
of
the
prior
voice
that
is
very
well
went
on
the
bishop
we
want
all
the
faithful
priests
possible
there
is
a
great
darkness
in
the
land
and
we
need
lights
to
lighten
it
you
have
a
brother
in
master
cromwell
service
sir
i
hear
chris
was
silent
you
must
not
grieve
too
much
god
almighty
can
set
all
right
it
may
be
he
thinks
he
is
serving
him
we
are
not
here
to
judge
but
to
give
our
own
account
the
bishop
went
on
presently
to
ask
a
few
questions
and
to
talk
of
master
more
saying
that
he
had
managed
to
correspond
with
him
for
a
while
but
that
now
all
the
means
for
doing
so
had
been
taken
away
from
them
both
as
well
as
his
own
books
it
is
a
great
grief
to
me
that
i
can
not
say
my
office
nor
say
nor
hear
mass
i
must
trust
now
to
the
holy
sacrifice
offered
by
others
he
spoke
so
tenderly
and
tranquilly
that
chris
was
hardly
able
to
keep
back
his
tears
it
seemed
that
the
soul
still
kept
its
serene
poise
in
that
wasted
body
and
was
independent
of
it
there
was
no
weakness
nor
peevishness
anywhere
the
very
room
with
its
rough
walls
its
cobwebbed
roof
its
uneven
flooring
its
dreadful
chill
and
gloom
seemed
alive
with
a
warm
redolent
spiritual
atmosphere
generated
by
this
keen
pure
soul
chris
had
never
been
near
so
real
a
sanctity
before
you
have
seen
nothing
of
my
rochester
folk
i
suppose
went
on
the
bishop
to
the
prior
the
prior
shook
his
head
i
am
very
downcast
about
them
sometimes
i
saw
many
of
them
at
the
court
the
other
day
i
forget
that
the
good
shepherd
can
guard
his
own
sheep
and
they
were
so
faithful
to
me
that
i
know
they
will
be
faithful
to
him
there
came
a
sound
of
a
key
being
knocked
upon
the
door
outside
and
the
bishop
stood
up
slowly
and
painfully
that
will
be
giles
he
said
hungry
for
supper
the
two
monks
sank
down
on
their
knees
and
as
chris
closed
his
eyes
he
heard
a
soft
murmur
of
blessing
over
his
head
then
each
kissed
his
hand
and
chris
went
to
the
door
half
blind
with
tears
he
heard
a
whisper
from
the
bishop
to
the
prior
who
still
lingered
a
moment
and
a
half
sob
god
helping
me
said
the
prior
there
was
no
more
spoken
and
the
two
went
down
the
stairs
together
into
the
golden
sunshine
with
the
warder
behind
them
chris
dared
not
look
at
the
other
he
had
had
a
glimpse
of
his
face
as
he
stood
aside
on
the
stairs
to
let
him
pass
and
what
he
saw
there
told
him
enough
there
were
plenty
of
boats
rocking
on
the
tide
at
the
foot
of
the
river
stairs
outside
the
tower
and
they
stepped
into
one
telling
the
man
to
row
to
southwark
it
was
a
glorious
summer
evening
now
the
river
lay
bathed
in
the
level
sunshine
that
turned
it
to
molten
gold
and
it
was
covered
with
boats
plying
in
all
directions
there
were
single
wherries
going
to
and
from
the
stairs
that
led
down
on
all
sides
into
the
water
and
barges
here
and
there
of
the
great
merchants
or
nobles
going
home
to
supper
with
a
line
of
oars
on
each
side
and
a
glow
of
colour
gilding
in
the
stem
and
prow
were
moving
up
stream
towards
the
city
london
bridge
stood
out
before
them
presently
like
a
palace
in
a
blue
and
romantic
against
the
western
glow
and
above
it
and
beyond
rose
up
the
tall
spire
of
the
cathedral
on
the
other
side
a
fringe
of
houses
began
a
little
to
the
east
of
the
bridge
and
ran
up
to
the
spires
of
southwark
on
the
other
side
and
on
them
lay
a
glory
of
sunset
with
deep
shadows
barring
them
where
the
alleys
ran
down
to
the
water
edge
here
and
there
behind
rose
up
the
heavy
masses
of
the
june
foliage
a
troop
of
swans
white
patches
on
the
splendour
were
breasting
up
against
the
tide
the
air
was
full
of
sound
the
rattle
and
dash
of
oars
men
voices
coming
clear
and
minute
across
the
water
and
as
they
got
out
near
the
bell
of
paul
boomed
far
from
away
indescribably
solemn
and
melodious
another
church
took
it
up
and
a
chorus
of
mellow
voices
tolled
out
the
angelus
chris
was
half
through
saying
it
to
himself
when
across
the
soft
murmur
sounded
the
clash
of
brass
far
away
beyond
the
bridge
the
boatman
paused
at
his
oars
turned
round
a
moment
grasping
them
in
one
hand
and
stared
under
the
other
chris
could
see
a
movement
among
the
boats
higher
up
and
there
seemed
to
break
out
a
commotion
at
the
foot
of
the
houses
on
london
bridge
and
then
far
away
came
the
sound
of
cheering
what
is
it
asked
the
prior
sharply
lifting
his
head
as
the
boatman
gave
an
exclamation
and
laid
furiously
to
his
oars
again
the
man
jerked
his
head
backwards
the
king
grace
he
said
for
a
minute
or
two
nothing
more
was
to
be
seen
a
boat
or
two
near
them
was
seen
making
off
to
the
side
from
to
leave
a
clear
passage
and
there
were
cries
from
the
direction
of
the
bridge
where
someone
seemed
to
be
in
difficulties
with
the
strong
stream
and
the
piers
a
wherry
that
was
directly
between
them
and
the
bridge
moved
off
and
the
shining
was
left
for
the
king
grace
to
come
down
then
again
the
brass
horns
sounded
nearer
chris
was
conscious
of
an
immense
excitement
the
dramatic
contrast
of
the
scene
he
had
just
left
with
that
which
he
was
witnessing
overpowered
him
he
had
seen
one
end
of
the
chain
of
life
the
dying
bishop
in
the
tower
in
his
rags
now
he
was
to
see
the
other
end
the
sovereign
at
whose
will
he
was
there
in
all
the
magnificence
of
a
pageant
the
prior
was
sitting
bolt
upright
on
the
seat
beside
him
one
hand
lay
on
his
knee
the
knuckles
white
with
clenching
the
other
gripped
the
side
of
the
boat
then
again
the
fierce
music
sounded
and
the
first
boat
appeared
under
one
of
the
wider
spans
of
the
bridge
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
away
the
stream
was
running
out
strongly
by
now
and
the
boatman
tugged
to
get
out
of
it
into
the
quieter
water
at
the
side
and
as
he
pulled
an
oar
snapped
the
prior
half
started
up
as
the
man
burst
out
into
an
exclamation
and
began
to
paddle
furiously
with
the
other
oar
but
the
boat
revolved
helplessly
and
he
was
forced
to
change
it
to
the
opposite
side
meanwhile
the
boats
were
beginning
to
stream
under
the
bridge
and
chris
seeing
that
the
boat
in
which
he
sat
was
sufficiently
out
of
the
way
to
allow
a
clear
passage
in
even
if
not
far
enough
removed
for
proper
deference
gave
himself
up
to
watching
the
splendid
sight
the
sun
had
now
dropped
behind
the
high
houses
by
the
bridge
and
a
shadow
lay
across
the
water
but
nearer
at
hand
the
way
was
clear
and
in
a
moment
more
the
leading
boat
had
entered
the
sunlight
there
was
no
possibility
of
mistake
as
to
whether
this
were
the
royal
barge
or
no
it
was
a
great
craft
seventy
feet
from
prow
to
stem
at
the
very
least
and
magnificent
with
colour
as
it
burst
out
into
the
sun
it
blazed
blindingly
with
gold
the
prow
shone
with
blue
and
crimson
the
stern
roofed
in
with
a
crimson
canopy
with
flying
tassels
trailed
brilliant
coarse
tapestries
on
either
side
and
the
royal
standard
streamed
out
behind
chris
tried
to
count
the
oars
as
they
swept
into
the
water
with
a
rhythmical
throb
and
out
again
flashing
a
fringe
of
drops
and
showing
a
coat
painted
on
each
blade
there
seemed
to
be
eight
or
ten
a
side
a
couple
of
trumpeters
stood
in
the
bows
behind
the
gilded
carved
figurehead
their
trumpets
held
out
symmetrically
with
the
square
hangings
flapping
as
they
came
he
could
see
now
the
heads
of
the
watermen
who
rowed
with
the
caps
of
the
royal
livery
moving
together
like
clockwork
at
the
swing
of
the
oars
behind
followed
the
other
boats
some
half
dozen
in
all
and
as
each
pair
burst
out
into
the
level
sunlight
with
a
splendour
of
gold
and
colour
and
the
roar
from
london
bridge
swelled
louder
and
louder
for
a
moment
the
young
monk
forgot
the
bitter
underlying
tragedy
of
all
that
he
had
seen
and
knew
forgot
oozy
and
trampled
tyburn
and
the
loaded
gallows
forgot
even
the
grim
heads
that
stared
out
with
dead
tortured
eyes
from
the
sheaves
of
pikes
rising
high
above
him
at
this
moment
against
the
rosy
sky
forgot
the
monks
of
the
charterhouse
and
their
mourning
hearts
the
insulted
queen
repudiated
and
declared
a
concubine
forgot
all
that
made
life
so
hard
to
live
and
understand
at
this
time
as
this
splendid
vision
of
the
lust
of
the
eyes
broke
out
in
pulsating
sound
and
colour
before
him
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
there
was
a
group
of
persons
under
the
canopy
of
the
of
the
leading
boat
the
splendid
centre
of
the
splendid
show
brilliant
in
crimson
and
gold
and
jewels
on
the
further
side
sat
two
men
chris
did
not
know
their
faces
but
as
his
eyes
rested
on
them
a
moment
he
noticed
that
one
was
burly
and
and
wore
some
insignia
across
his
shoulders
at
the
near
side
were
the
backs
of
two
ladies
silken
clad
and
slashed
with
crimson
their
white
jewelled
necks
visible
under
their
coiled
hair
and
tight
square
cut
caps
and
in
the
centre
sat
a
pair
a
man
and
a
woman
and
on
these
he
fixed
his
eyes
as
the
boat
swept
up
not
twenty
yards
away
for
he
knew
who
they
must
be
the
man
was
leaning
back
looking
gigantic
in
his
puffed
sleeves
and
wide
mantle
one
great
arm
was
flung
along
the
back
of
the
tapestried
seat
and
his
large
head
capped
with
purple
and
feathers
was
bending
towards
the
woman
who
sat
beyond
chris
could
make
out
a
fringe
of
reddish
hair
beneath
his
ear
and
at
the
back
of
the
flat
head
between
the
high
collar
and
the
cap
he
caught
a
glimpse
too
of
a
sedate
face
beyond
set
on
a
slender
neck
with
downcast
eyes
and
red
lips
and
then
as
the
boat
came
opposite
and
the
trumpeters
sent
out
a
brazen
crash
from
the
trumpets
at
their
lips
the
man
turned
his
head
and
stared
straight
at
the
boat
it
was
an
immensely
wide
face
fringed
with
reddish
hair
scanty
about
the
lips
and
more
full
below
and
it
looked
the
wider
from
the
narrow
drooping
eyes
set
near
together
and
the
small
pursed
mouth
below
his
chin
swelled
down
fold
after
fold
into
his
collar
and
the
cheeks
were
wide
and
heavy
on
either
side
it
was
the
most
powerful
face
that
chris
had
ever
seen
or
dreamed
of
the
animal
brooded
in
every
line
and
curve
of
it
it
would
have
been
brutish
but
for
the
steady
pale
stare
of
the
eyes
and
the
tight
little
lips
it
fascinated
and
terrified
him
the
flourish
ended
the
roar
of
the
rowlocks
sounded
out
again
like
the
beating
of
a
furious
heart
the
king
turned
his
head
again
and
said
something
and
the
boat
swept
past
chris
found
that
he
had
started
to
his
feet
and
sat
down
again
breathing
quickly
and
heavily
with
a
kind
of
indignant
loathing
that
was
new
to
him
this
then
was
the
master
of
england
the
heart
of
all
their
troubles
that
gorgeous
fat
man
with
the
broad
pulpy
face
in
his
crimson
and
jewels
and
that
was
his
concubine
who
sat
demure
beside
him
with
her
white
folded
ringed
hands
on
her
lap
her
beautiful
eyes
cast
down
and
her
lord
hot
breath
in
her
ear
it
was
these
that
were
purifying
the
church
of
god
of
such
men
as
the
in
the
tower
and
the
witty
holy
lawyer
it
was
by
the
will
of
such
as
these
that
the
heads
of
the
carthusian
fathers
bound
brow
and
chin
with
linen
stared
up
and
down
with
dead
eyes
from
the
pikes
overhead
he
sat
panting
and
unseeing
as
the
other
boats
swept
past
full
of
the
king
friends
all
going
down
to
greenwich
there
broke
out
a
roar
from
the
tower
behind
and
he
started
and
turned
round
to
see
the
white
smoke
eddying
up
from
the
edge
of
the
wall
beside
the
traitor
gate
a
shrill
cheer
or
two
far
away
and
thin
sounded
from
the
figures
on
the
wharf
and
the
boatmen
about
the
stairs
the
wherryman
sat
down
again
and
put
on
his
cap
body
of
god
he
said
there
was
but
just
time
and
he
began
to
pull
again
with
his
single
oar
towards
the
shore
chris
looked
at
the
prior
a
moment
and
down
again
he
was
sitting
with
tight
lips
and
hands
clasped
in
his
lap
and
his
eyes
were
wild
and
piteous
they
borrowed
an
oar
presently
from
another
boat
and
went
on
up
towards
southwark
the
wherryman
pawed
once
to
spit
on
his
hands
as
they
neared
the
rush
of
the
current
below
the
bridge
that
was
master
cromwell
with
his
grace
he
said
chris
looked
at
him
questioningly
him
with
the
gold
collar
he
added
and
that
was
audley
by
him
the
prior
had
glanced
at
chris
as
cromwell
name
was
mentioned
but
said
nothing
for
the
present
and
chris
himself
was
lost
again
in
musing
that
was
ralph
master
then
the
king
man
feared
next
in
england
after
the
king
himself
and
chancellor
audley
too
and
anne
all
in
one
wooden
boat
how
easy
for
god
to
put
out
his
hand
and
finish
them
and
then
he
was
ashamed
at
his
own
thought
so
faithless
and
timid
and
he
remembered
fisher
once
more
and
his
gallant
spirit
in
that
broken
body
a
minute
or
two
later
they
had
landed
at
the
stairs
and
were
making
their
way
up
to
the
hostel
the
prior
put
out
his
hand
and
checked
him
as
he
stepped
ahead
to
knock
wait
he
said
do
you
know
who
signed
the
order
we
used
at
the
tower
chris
shook
his
head
master
cromwell
said
the
prior
and
do
you
know
by
whose
hand
it
came
chris
stared
in
astonishment
it
was
by
your
brother
he
said
chapter
xiv
the
sacred
purple
it
was
a
bright
morning
a
few
days
later
when
the
bishop
of
rochester
suffered
on
tower
hill
chris
was
there
early
and
took
up
his
position
at
the
outskirts
of
the
little
crowd
facing
towards
the
tower
itself
and
for
a
couple
of
hours
watched
the
shadows
creep
round
the
piles
of
masonry
and
the
light
deepen
and
mellow
between
him
and
the
great
mass
of
the
white
tower
a
few
hundred
yards
away
there
was
a
large
crowd
there
a
good
while
before
nine
and
chris
found
himself
at
the
hour
no
longer
on
the
outskirts
but
in
the
centre
of
the
people
he
had
served
the
prior
mass
at
six
and
had
obtained
leave
from
him
the
night
before
to
be
present
at
the
execution
but
the
prior
himself
had
given
no
suggestion
of
coming
chris
had
begun
to
see
that
his
superior
was
going
through
a
conflict
and
that
he
wished
to
spare
himself
any
further
motives
of
terror
he
began
too
to
understand
that
the
visit
to
the
bishop
had
had
the
effect
of
strengthening
the
courage
whatever
had
been
the
intention
on
the
part
of
the
authorities
in
allowing
him
to
go
he
was
still
wondering
why
ralph
had
lent
himself
to
the
scheme
but
had
not
dared
to
press
his
superior
further
the
bishop
had
made
a
magnificent
speech
at
his
trial
and
had
protested
with
an
extraordinary
pathos
that
called
out
a
demonstration
from
the
crowd
in
court
against
master
rich
betrayal
of
his
confidence
under
promise
of
the
king
that
nothing
that
he
said
to
his
friend
should
be
used
against
him
the
bishop
had
shown
his
mind
in
a
private
conversation
on
the
subject
of
the
supremacy
act
and
now
this
had
been
brought
against
him
by
rich
himself
at
the
trial
seeing
it
pleased
the
king
highness
said
the
bishop
to
send
to
me
thus
secretly
to
know
my
poor
advice
and
opinion
which
i
most
gladly
was
and
ever
will
be
ready
to
offer
to
him
when
so
commanded
methinks
it
very
hard
to
allow
the
same
as
sufficient
testimony
against
me
to
prove
me
guilty
of
high
treason
rich
excused
himself
by
affirming
that
he
said
or
did
nothing
more
than
what
the
king
commanded
him
to
do
and
the
trial
ended
by
the
condemnation
as
chris
waited
by
the
scaffold
he
prayed
almost
incessantly
there
was
sufficient
spur
for
prayer
in
the
menacing
fortress
before
him
with
its
hundred
tiny
windows
and
the
new
scaffold
some
five
or
six
feet
high
that
stood
in
the
foreground
he
wondered
how
the
bishop
was
passing
his
time
and
thought
he
knew
the
long
grey
wall
beyond
the
moat
and
the
towers
that
rose
above
it
were
suggestive
in
their
silent
strength
from
where
he
stood
too
he
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
shining
reaches
of
the
river
with
the
green
slopes
on
the
further
side
and
the
freedom
and
beauty
of
the
sight
the
delicate
haze
that
hung
over
the
water
the
birds
winging
their
way
across
the
boats
plying
to
and
fro
struck
a
vivid
contrast
to
the
grim
fatality
of
the
prison
and
the
scaffold
a
bell
sounded
out
somewhere
from
the
tower
and
a
ripple
ran
through
the
crowd
there
was
an
immensely
tall
man
a
few
yards
from
chris
and
chris
could
see
his
face
turn
suddenly
towards
the
lower
ground
by
the
river
where
the
gateway
rose
up
dark
against
the
bright
water
the
face
suddenly
lighted
with
interest
and
chris
saw
his
lips
move
and
his
eyes
become
intent
then
a
surging
movement
began
and
the
monk
was
swept
away
to
the
left
by
the
packed
crowd
round
him
there
were
faces
lining
the
wall
and
opposite
and
all
were
turned
one
way
a
great
murmur
began
to
swell
up
and
a
woman
beside
him
turned
white
and
began
to
sob
quietly
his
eyes
caught
a
bright
point
of
light
that
died
again
flashed
out
and
resolved
itself
into
a
gleaming
line
of
halberds
moving
on
towards
the
right
above
the
heads
up
the
slope
to
the
scaffold
he
saw
a
horse
toss
his
head
and
then
a
feathered
cap
or
two
swaying
behind
then
for
one
instant
between
the
shifting
heads
in
front
he
caught
sight
of
a
lean
face
framed
in
a
flapped
cap
swaying
rhythmically
as
if
borne
on
a
chair
it
vanished
again
the
flashing
line
of
halberds
elongated
itself
divided
and
came
between
the
scaffold
and
him
and
the
murmur
of
the
crowd
died
to
a
silence
a
solemn
bell
clanged
out
again
from
the
interior
of
the
prison
and
chris
his
wet
hands
knit
together
began
to
count
the
strokes
mechanically
staring
at
the
narrow
rail
of
the
scaffold
and
waiting
for
the
sight
that
he
knew
would
come
then
again
he
was
swept
along
a
yard
or
two
to
the
right
and
when
he
had
recovered
his
feet
a
man
was
on
the
scaffold
bending
forwards
and
gesticulating
another
head
rose
into
the
line
of
vision
and
this
man
too
turned
towards
the
steps
up
which
he
had
come
and
stood
one
hand
outstretched
again
a
murmur
and
movement
began
chris
had
to
look
to
his
foothold
and
when
he
raised
his
head
again
a
solemn
low
roar
was
rising
up
and
swelling
of
pity
and
excitement
for
silhouetted
against
the
sunlit
tower
behind
stood
the
man
for
whose
sake
all
were
there
he
was
in
a
black
gown
and
tippet
and
carried
his
two
hands
clasped
to
his
breast
and
in
them
was
a
book
and
a
crucifix
his
cap
was
on
his
head
and
the
white
face
incredibly
thin
looked
out
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
chris
hardly
noticed
that
the
scaffold
was
filling
with
people
until
a
figure
came
forward
in
black
with
a
masked
face
and
bowed
deferentially
to
the
bishop
and
in
an
instant
silence
fell
again
he
saw
the
bishop
turn
and
bow
slightly
in
return
and
in
the
stillness
that
wonderful
voice
sounded
out
with
the
clear
minuteness
of
words
spoken
in
the
open
air
clear
and
penetrating
over
the
whole
ground
i
forgive
you
very
heartily
and
i
hope
you
will
see
me
overcome
this
storm
lustily
the
black
figure
fell
back
and
the
bishop
stood
hesitating
looking
this
way
and
that
as
if
for
direction
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
came
forward
but
chris
could
only
see
his
lips
move
as
a
murmur
had
broken
out
again
at
the
bishop
answer
but
he
signed
with
his
hand
and
stepped
behind
the
prisoner
the
bishop
nodded
lifted
his
hand
and
took
off
his
cap
and
his
white
hair
appeared
then
he
fumbled
at
his
throat
holding
the
book
and
crucifix
in
his
other
hand
and
with
the
lieutenant
help
slipped
off
his
tippet
and
loose
gown
and
as
he
freed
himself
and
stood
in
his
doublet
and
hose
a
great
sobbing
cry
of
horror
and
compassion
rose
from
the
straining
faces
for
he
seemed
scarcely
to
be
a
living
man
so
dreadful
was
his
emaciation
above
that
lean
figure
of
death
looked
out
the
worn
old
face
serene
and
confident
he
was
again
holding
the
book
and
crucifix
clasped
to
his
breast
as
he
stepped
to
the
edge
of
the
scaffold
the
cry
died
to
a
murmur
and
ceased
abruptly
as
he
began
his
speech
every
word
of
which
was
audible
christian
people
he
began
i
am
come
hither
to
die
for
the
faith
of
christ
holy
catholic
church
he
raised
his
voice
a
little
and
it
rang
out
confidently
and
i
thank
god
that
hitherto
my
stomach
hath
served
me
very
well
thereunto
so
that
yet
i
have
not
feared
death
wherefore
i
desire
you
all
to
help
and
assist
with
your
prayers
that
at
the
very
point
and
instant
of
death
stroke
i
may
in
that
very
moment
stand
steadfast
without
fainting
in
any
one
point
of
the
catholic
faith
free
from
any
fear
he
paused
again
his
hands
closed
one
on
the
other
he
glanced
up
and
i
beseech
the
almighty
god
of
his
infinite
goodness
and
mercy
to
save
the
king
and
this
realm
and
that
it
may
please
him
to
hold
his
hand
over
it
and
send
the
king
highness
good
counsel
he
ceased
abruptly
and
dropped
his
head
a
gentle
groan
ran
through
the
crowd
chris
felt
his
throat
contract
and
a
mist
blinded
his
eyes
for
a
moment
then
he
saw
the
bishop
slip
the
crucifix
into
his
other
hand
and
open
the
book
apparently
at
random
his
lean
finger
dropped
upon
the
page
and
he
read
aloud
softly
as
if
to
himself
this
is
life
eternal
that
they
might
know
thee
the
one
true
god
and
jesus
christ
whom
thou
hast
sent
i
have
glorified
thee
on
the
earth
i
have
finished
the
work
which
thou
gavest
me
to
do
again
there
was
silence
for
it
seemed
as
if
he
was
going
to
make
a
sermon
but
he
looked
down
at
the
book
a
moment
or
two
then
he
closed
it
gently
here
is
learning
enough
for
me
he
said
to
my
life
end
there
was
a
movement
among
the
silent
figures
at
the
back
of
the
scaffold
and
the
lieutenant
stepped
forward
once
more
the
bishop
turned
to
meet
him
and
nodded
handing
him
the
book
and
then
with
the
crucifix
still
in
his
hands
and
with
the
officer
help
sank
on
to
his
knees
it
seemed
to
chris
as
if
he
waited
an
eternity
but
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
him
round
about
was
the
breathing
mass
of
the
crowd
overhead
the
clear
summer
sky
up
from
the
river
came
the
sounds
of
cries
and
the
pulse
of
oars
and
from
the
tower
now
and
again
the
call
of
a
horn
and
the
stroke
of
a
bell
but
all
this
was
external
and
seemed
to
have
no
effect
upon
the
intense
silence
of
the
heart
that
radiated
from
the
scaffold
and
in
which
the
monk
felt
himself
enveloped
the
space
between
himself
and
the
bishop
seemed
annihilated
and
chris
found
himself
in
company
with
a
thousand
others
close
beside
the
man
soul
that
was
to
leave
the
world
so
soon
he
could
not
pray
but
he
had
the
sensation
of
gripping
that
imploring
spirit
pulsating
with
it
furthering
with
his
own
strained
will
that
stream
of
effort
that
he
knew
was
going
forth
meanwhile
his
eyes
stared
at
him
and
saw
without
seeing
how
the
old
man
now
leaned
back
with
closed
eyes
and
moving
lips
now
he
bent
forward
and
looked
at
the
crucified
figure
that
he
held
between
his
hands
now
lifted
it
and
lingeringly
kissed
the
pierced
feet
behind
stood
the
stiff
line
of
officers
and
in
front
below
the
rail
rose
the
glitter
of
the
halberds
the
minutes
went
by
and
there
was
no
change
the
world
seemed
to
have
grown
rigid
with
expectancy
it
was
as
if
time
stood
still
there
fell
upon
the
monk
soul
not
suddenly
but
imperceptibly
something
of
that
sense
of
the
unseen
that
he
had
experienced
at
tyburn
for
a
certain
space
all
sorrow
and
terror
left
him
he
knew
tangibly
now
that
to
which
at
other
times
his
mere
faith
assented
he
knew
that
the
world
of
spirit
was
the
real
one
that
the
tower
the
axe
the
imminent
shadow
of
death
were
little
more
than
illusions
they
were
part
of
the
staging
significant
and
necessary
but
with
no
substance
of
reality
the
eternal
world
in
which
god
was
all
alone
was
a
fact
he
felt
no
longer
pity
or
regret
nothing
but
the
sheer
existence
of
a
being
of
which
all
persons
there
were
sharers
poised
in
an
eternal
instant
remained
with
him
this
strange
sensation
was
scarcely
disturbed
by
the
rising
of
the
lean
black
figure
from
its
knees
chris
watched
him
as
he
might
have
watched
the
inevitable
movement
of
an
actor
performing
his
part
the
bishop
turned
eastward
to
where
the
sun
was
now
high
above
the
tower
gate
and
spoke
once
more
ad
eum
et
illuminamini
et
facies
vestræ
non
then
once
more
in
the
deathly
stillness
he
turned
round
and
his
eyes
ran
over
the
countless
faces
turned
up
to
his
own
but
there
was
a
certain
tranquil
severity
in
his
face
the
severity
of
one
who
has
taken
a
bitter
cup
firmly
into
his
hand
his
lips
were
tightly
compressed
and
his
eyes
were
deep
and
steady
then
very
slowly
he
lifted
his
right
hand
touched
his
forehead
and
enveloped
himself
in
a
great
sign
of
the
cross
still
looking
out
unwaveringly
over
the
faces
and
immediately
without
any
hesitation
sank
down
on
his
knees
put
his
hands
before
him
on
to
the
scaffold
and
stretched
himself
flat
he
was
now
invisible
to
chris
for
the
low
block
on
which
he
had
laid
his
neck
was
only
a
few
inches
high
there
was
again
a
surge
and
a
murmur
as
the
headsman
stepped
forward
with
the
axe
over
his
shoulder
and
stood
waiting
then
again
the
moments
began
to
pass
chris
lost
all
consciousness
of
his
own
being
he
was
aware
of
nothing
but
the
objective
presence
of
the
scaffold
of
an
overpowering
expectancy
it
seemed
as
if
something
were
stretched
taut
in
his
brain
at
breaking
point
as
if
some
vast
thing
were
on
the
point
of
revelation
all
else
had
vanished
the
scene
round
him
the
sense
of
the
invisible
there
was
but
the
point
of
space
left
waiting
for
an
explosion
there
was
a
sense
of
wrenching
torture
as
the
headsman
lifted
the
axe
bringing
it
high
round
behind
him
the
motion
seemed
shockingly
slow
and
to
wring
the
strained
nerves
to
agony
then
in
a
blinding
climax
the
axe
fell
chapter
xv
the
king
friend
overfield
court
was
mildly
stirred
at
the
news
that
master
christopher
would
stay
there
a
few
days
on
his
way
back
from
london
to
lewes
it
was
not
so
exciting
as
when
master
ralph
was
to
come
as
the
latter
made
more
demands
than
a
mere
monk
for
the
one
the
horses
must
be
in
the
pink
of
condition
the
game
neither
too
wild
nor
too
tame
his
rooms
must
be
speckless
neither
too
full
nor
too
empty
of
furniture
for
the
other
it
did
not
matter
so
much
for
he
was
now
not
only
a
younger
brother
but
a
monk
and
therefore
accustomed
to
contradiction
and
desirous
to
acquiesce
in
arrangements
lady
torridon
indeed
took
no
steps
at
all
when
she
heard
that
chris
was
coming
beyond
expressing
a
desire
that
she
might
not
be
called
upon
to
discuss
the
ecclesiastical
situation
at
every
meal
and
when
chris
finally
arrived
a
week
after
bishop
fisher
execution
having
parted
with
the
prior
at
cuckfield
she
was
walking
in
her
private
garden
beyond
the
moat
sir
james
was
in
a
very
different
state
he
had
caused
two
rooms
to
be
prepared
that
his
son
might
take
his
choice
one
next
to
and
therefore
close
to
the
chapel
and
the
other
the
old
chamber
that
chris
had
occupied
before
he
went
to
lewes
and
when
the
monk
at
last
rode
up
on
alone
on
his
tired
mule
with
his
little
bag
strapped
to
the
crupper
an
hour
before
sunset
his
father
was
out
at
the
gatehouse
to
meet
him
and
walked
up
beside
him
to
the
house
with
his
hand
laid
on
his
son
knee
they
hardly
spoke
a
word
as
they
went
sir
james
had
looked
up
at
chris
white
strained
face
and
had
put
one
question
and
the
other
had
nodded
and
the
hearts
of
both
were
full
as
they
went
together
to
the
house
the
father
and
son
supped
together
alone
that
night
in
the
private
parlour
for
no
one
had
dared
to
ask
lady
torridon
to
postpone
her
usual
supper
hour
and
as
soon
as
that
was
over
and
chris
had
told
what
he
had
seen
with
many
silences
they
went
into
the
where
lady
torridon
and
carleton
were
awaiting
them
by
the
hearth
with
the
flemish
tiles
the
mother
was
sitting
as
usual
in
her
tall
chair
with
her
beautiful
hands
on
her
lap
and
smiled
with
a
genial
contempt
as
she
ran
her
eyes
up
and
down
her
son
figure
the
habit
suits
you
very
well
my
son
in
every
way
she
added
looking
at
him
curiously
chris
had
greeted
her
an
hour
before
at
his
arrival
so
there
was
no
ceremony
of
salute
to
be
gone
through
now
he
sat
down
by
his
father
you
have
seen
ralph
i
hear
observed
lady
torridon
chris
did
not
know
how
much
she
knew
and
simply
assented
he
had
told
his
father
everything
i
have
some
news
she
went
on
in
an
unusually
talkative
mood
for
you
both
ralph
is
to
marry
beatrice
atherton
the
girl
you
saw
in
his
rooms
christopher
sir
james
gave
an
exclamation
and
leant
forward
and
chris
tightened
his
lips
she
is
a
friend
of
more
went
on
lady
torridon
apparently
unconscious
of
the
sensation
she
was
making
but
that
is
business
i
suppose
why
did
ralph
not
write
to
me
asked
his
father
with
a
touch
of
sternness
lady
torridon
answered
him
by
a
short
pregnant
silence
and
then
went
on
i
suppose
he
wished
me
to
break
it
to
you
it
will
not
be
for
two
or
three
years
she
says
she
can
not
leave
more
for
the
present
chris
brain
was
confused
by
the
news
and
yet
it
all
seemed
external
to
him
as
he
had
ridden
up
to
the
house
in
the
evening
he
had
recognised
for
the
first
time
how
he
no
longer
belonged
to
the
place
his
two
years
at
lewes
had
done
their
work
and
he
came
to
his
home
now
not
as
a
son
but
as
a
guest
he
had
even
begun
to
perceive
the
difference
after
his
quarrel
with
ralph
for
he
had
not
been
conscious
of
the
same
personal
sting
at
his
brother
sins
that
he
would
have
felt
five
years
ago
and
now
this
news
while
it
affected
him
did
not
penetrate
to
the
still
sanctuary
that
he
had
hewn
out
of
his
heart
during
those
months
of
discipline
but
his
father
was
roused
he
should
have
written
to
me
he
said
sternly
and
my
wife
i
will
beg
you
to
remember
that
i
have
a
right
to
my
son
business
lady
torridon
did
not
move
or
answer
he
leaned
back
again
and
passed
his
hand
tenderly
through
chris
arm
it
was
very
strange
to
the
younger
son
to
find
himself
a
few
minutes
later
up
again
in
the
west
gallery
of
the
chapel
where
he
had
knelt
two
years
before
and
for
a
few
moments
he
almost
felt
himself
at
home
but
the
mechanical
shifting
of
his
scapular
aside
as
he
sat
down
for
the
psalms
recalled
facts
then
he
had
been
in
his
silk
suit
his
hands
had
been
rough
with
his
his
beard
had
been
soft
on
his
chin
and
the
blood
hot
in
his
cheeks
now
he
was
in
his
habit
and
shaven
tired
and
oppressed
still
weak
from
the
pangs
of
he
was
further
from
human
love
but
nearer
the
divine
he
thought
he
sat
with
his
father
a
few
minutes
after
compline
and
sir
james
spoke
more
frankly
of
the
news
that
they
had
heard
if
she
is
really
a
friend
of
more
he
said
she
may
be
his
salvation
i
am
sorely
disappointed
in
him
i
did
not
know
master
cromwell
when
i
sent
him
to
him
as
i
do
now
is
it
my
fault
chris
chris
told
his
father
presently
of
what
the
prior
had
said
as
to
assistance
in
the
matter
of
the
visit
that
the
two
monks
had
paid
to
the
tower
and
asked
an
interpretation
sir
james
sat
quiet
a
minute
or
two
stroking
his
pointed
grey
beard
softly
and
looking
into
the
hearth
god
forgive
me
if
i
am
wrong
my
son
he
said
at
last
but
i
wonder
whether
they
let
the
my
lord
prior
go
to
the
tower
in
order
to
shake
the
confidence
of
both
do
you
think
so
chris
chris
too
was
silent
a
moment
he
knew
he
must
not
speak
evil
of
dignities
it
may
be
so
i
know
that
my
lord
prior
well
my
son
my
lord
prior
has
been
very
anxious
sir
james
patted
his
son
on
the
knee
and
reassured
him
prior
crowham
is
a
very
holy
man
i
think
but
but
somewhat
delicate
however
their
designs
have
come
to
nothing
the
bishop
is
in
glory
and
the
other
more
courageous
than
he
was
chris
also
had
a
few
words
with
carleton
before
he
went
to
bed
sitting
where
he
had
sat
in
the
moonlight
two
years
before
if
they
have
done
so
much
said
the
priest
they
will
do
more
when
a
man
has
slipped
over
a
precipice
he
can
not
save
his
fall
master
more
will
be
the
next
to
go
i
make
no
doubt
of
that
you
are
to
be
a
priest
soon
chris
they
have
applied
for
leave
said
the
monk
shortly
in
two
years
i
shall
be
a
priest
no
doubt
if
god
wills
you
are
happy
asked
the
other
chris
made
a
little
gesture
i
do
not
know
what
that
means
he
said
but
i
know
i
have
done
right
i
feel
nothing
god
ways
and
his
world
are
too
strange
the
priest
looked
at
him
oddly
without
speaking
well
father
asked
chris
smiling
you
are
right
said
the
chaplain
brusquely
you
have
done
well
you
have
crossed
the
border
chris
felt
the
blood
surge
in
his
temples
the
border
he
asked
the
border
of
dreams
they
surround
the
religious
life
and
you
have
passed
through
them
chris
still
looked
at
him
with
parted
lips
this
praise
was
sweet
after
the
bitterness
of
his
failure
with
ralph
the
priest
seemed
to
know
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
oh
you
will
fail
sometimes
he
said
but
not
finally
you
are
a
monk
my
son
and
a
man
lady
torridon
retired
into
her
impregnable
silence
again
after
her
sallies
of
speech
on
the
previous
evening
but
as
the
few
days
went
on
that
chris
had
been
allowed
to
spend
with
his
parents
he
was
none
the
less
aware
that
her
attitude
towards
him
was
one
of
contempt
she
showed
it
in
a
hundred
ways
by
not
appearing
to
see
him
by
refusing
to
modify
her
habits
in
the
smallest
particular
for
his
convenience
by
a
rigid
silence
on
the
subject
that
was
in
the
hearts
of
both
him
and
his
father
she
performed
her
duties
as
punctually
and
efficiently
as
ever
dealt
dispassionately
and
justly
with
an
old
servant
who
had
been
troublesome
and
with
regard
to
whom
her
husband
was
both
afraid
and
tender
but
never
asked
for
confidences
or
manifested
the
minutest
detail
of
her
own
accord
on
the
fourth
day
after
chris
arrival
news
came
that
sir
thomas
more
had
been
condemned
but
it
roused
no
more
excitement
than
the
fall
of
a
threatening
rod
it
had
been
known
to
be
inevitable
and
then
on
last
evening
at
home
came
the
last
details
sir
james
and
chris
had
been
out
for
a
long
ride
up
the
estate
talking
but
little
for
each
knew
what
was
in
the
heart
of
the
other
and
they
were
just
dismounting
at
the
when
there
was
a
sound
of
furious
galloping
and
a
couple
of
riders
burst
through
the
gateway
a
hundred
yards
away
chris
felt
his
heart
leap
and
hammer
in
his
throat
but
stood
passively
awaiting
what
he
knew
was
coming
and
a
few
seconds
later
nicholas
maxwell
checked
his
horse
passionately
at
the
steps
god
damn
them
he
cried
with
a
crimson
quivering
face
sir
james
stepped
up
at
once
and
took
him
by
the
arm
nick
he
said
and
glanced
at
the
staring
grooms
nicholas
showed
his
teeth
like
a
dog
god
damn
them
he
said
again
the
other
rider
had
come
up
by
now
he
was
dusty
and
seemed
spent
he
was
a
stranger
to
the
father
and
son
who
waited
on
the
steps
but
he
looked
like
a
groom
and
slipped
off
his
horse
deftly
and
took
sir
nicholas
bridle
come
in
nick
said
sir
james
we
can
talk
in
the
house
as
the
three
went
up
together
with
the
strange
rider
at
a
respectful
distance
behind
nicholas
broke
out
again
in
one
sentence
they
have
done
it
he
said
he
is
dead
mother
of
god
his
whip
twitched
in
his
clenching
hand
he
turned
and
jerked
his
head
beckoningly
to
the
man
who
followed
and
the
four
went
on
together
through
the
hall
and
into
sir
james
parlour
sir
james
shut
the
door
tell
us
nick
nicholas
stood
at
the
hearth
glaring
and
shifting
this
fellow
knows
he
saw
it
tell
them
dick
the
man
gave
his
account
he
was
one
of
the
servants
of
sir
younger
brother
who
lived
in
town
and
had
been
sent
down
to
great
keynes
immediately
after
the
execution
that
had
taken
place
that
morning
he
was
a
man
of
tolerable
education
and
told
his
story
well
sir
james
sat
as
he
listened
with
his
hand
shading
his
eyes
nicholas
was
fidgetting
at
the
hearth
interrupting
the
servant
now
and
again
with
questions
and
reminders
and
chris
leaned
in
the
dark
corner
by
the
window
there
floated
vividly
before
his
mind
as
he
listened
the
setting
of
the
scene
that
he
had
looked
upon
a
few
days
ago
though
there
were
new
actors
in
it
now
it
was
this
morning
sir
on
tower
hill
there
was
a
great
company
there
long
before
the
time
he
came
out
bravely
enough
walking
with
the
lieutenant
that
was
his
friend
and
with
a
red
cross
in
his
hand
you
were
close
by
put
in
nicholas
yes
sir
i
was
beside
the
stairs
they
shook
as
he
went
up
they
were
crazy
steps
and
he
told
the
lieutenant
to
have
a
care
to
him
the
words
man
the
words
i
am
not
sure
sir
but
they
were
after
this
fashion
me
safe
up
master
lieutenant
i
will
shift
for
myself
at
the
coming
down
so
he
got
up
safe
and
stamped
once
or
twice
merrily
to
see
if
all
were
firm
then
he
made
a
speech
sir
and
begged
all
there
to
pray
for
him
he
told
them
that
he
was
to
die
for
the
faith
of
the
catholic
church
as
my
lord
of
rochester
did
have
you
heard
of
my
lord
head
being
taken
to
nan
boleyn
put
in
nicholas
fiercely
sir
james
looked
up
presently
nick
he
said
the
man
went
on
master
more
kneeled
down
presently
at
his
prayers
and
all
the
folk
kept
very
quiet
there
was
not
one
that
cried
against
him
then
he
stood
up
again
put
off
his
gown
so
that
his
neck
was
bare
and
passed
his
hand
over
it
smiling
then
he
told
the
headsman
that
it
was
but
a
short
one
and
bade
him
be
brave
and
strike
straight
lest
his
good
name
should
suffer
then
he
laid
himself
down
to
the
block
and
put
his
neck
on
it
but
he
moved
again
before
he
gave
the
sign
and
put
his
beard
out
in
front
for
he
had
grown
one
in
prison
give
us
the
words
snarled
nicholas
he
said
sir
that
his
beard
had
done
no
treason
and
need
not
therefore
suffer
as
he
had
to
do
and
then
he
thrust
out
his
hand
for
a
sign
and
was
done
at
a
stroke
god
damn
them
hissed
nicholas
again
as
a
kind
of
amen
turning
swiftly
to
the
so
that
his
face
could
not
be
seen
there
was
complete
silence
for
a
few
seconds
the
groom
had
his
eyes
cast
down
and
stood
there
then
again
he
spoke
as
to
my
lord
of
rochester
head
that
was
taken
off
to
the
the
queen
they
say
in
a
white
bag
and
she
struck
it
on
the
mouth
nicholas
dropped
his
head
against
his
hand
that
rested
on
the
and
the
body
rested
naked
all
day
on
the
scaffold
with
the
drinking
round
about
and
was
tumbled
into
a
hole
in
barking
churchyard
that
night
at
whose
orders
at
master
cromwell
sir
again
there
was
silence
and
again
the
groom
broke
it
there
was
more
said
sir
and
hesitated
the
old
man
signed
to
him
to
go
on
they
say
that
my
lord
head
shone
with
light
each
night
on
the
bridge
said
the
man
reverently
there
was
a
great
press
there
i
know
all
day
so
that
the
streets
were
blocked
and
none
could
come
or
go
and
so
they
tumbled
that
into
the
river
at
last
at
least
is
supposed
so
for
was
gone
when
i
looked
nicholas
turned
round
and
his
eyes
were
bright
and
his
face
fiery
and
discoloured
sir
james
stood
up
and
his
voice
was
broken
as
he
spoke
thank
you
my
man
you
have
told
your
story
well
as
the
groom
turned
to
go
out
sir
nicholas
wheeled
round
swiftly
to
the
hearth
and
buried
his
face
on
his
arm
and
chris
saw
a
great
heaving
begin
to
shake
his
broad
shoulders
the
king
triumph
book
ii
part
i
the
smaller
houses
chapter
i
an
act
of
faith
towards
the
end
of
august
beatrice
atherton
was
walking
up
the
north
bank
of
the
river
from
charing
to
westminster
to
announce
to
ralph
her
arrival
in
town
on
the
previous
night
she
had
gone
through
horrors
since
the
june
day
on
which
she
had
seen
the
two
brothers
together
with
margaret
beside
her
she
had
watched
master
more
in
court
in
his
frieze
gown
leaning
on
his
stick
bent
and
grey
with
imprisonment
had
heard
his
clear
answers
his
searching
questions
and
his
merry
conclusion
after
sentence
had
been
pronounced
she
had
stayed
at
home
with
the
stricken
family
on
the
morning
of
the
sixth
of
july
kneeling
with
them
at
her
prayers
in
the
chapel
of
the
new
building
during
the
hours
until
roper
looked
in
and
trembling
and
they
knew
that
all
was
over
she
went
with
them
to
the
burial
in
peter
chapel
in
the
tower
and
last
which
was
the
most
dreadful
ordeal
of
all
she
had
stood
in
the
summer
darkness
by
the
had
heard
the
cautious
stroke
of
oars
and
the
footsteps
coming
up
the
path
and
had
let
margaret
in
bearing
her
precious
burden
robbed
from
the
spike
on
london
bridge
then
for
a
while
she
had
gone
down
to
the
country
with
more
and
her
daughters
and
now
she
was
back
once
more
in
a
kind
of
psychical
convalescence
at
her
aunt
new
house
on
the
at
charing
her
face
was
a
little
paler
than
it
used
to
be
but
there
was
a
quickening
brightness
in
her
eyes
as
she
swept
along
in
her
blue
mantle
with
her
maid
beside
her
in
the
rear
of
the
liveried
servant
who
carried
a
wand
a
few
yards
in
front
she
was
rehearsing
to
herself
the
scene
in
which
ralph
had
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
where
chris
had
left
the
room
the
two
had
remained
perfectly
still
until
the
had
closed
and
then
ralph
had
turned
to
her
with
a
question
in
his
steady
eyes
she
had
told
him
then
that
she
did
not
believe
one
word
of
what
the
monk
had
insinuated
but
she
had
been
conscious
even
at
the
time
that
she
was
making
what
theologians
call
an
act
of
faith
it
was
not
that
there
were
not
difficulties
to
her
in
ralph
position
there
were
plenty
but
she
had
determined
by
a
final
and
swift
decision
to
disregard
them
and
believe
in
him
it
was
a
last
step
in
a
process
that
continued
ever
since
she
had
become
interested
by
this
strong
brusque
man
and
it
had
been
precipitated
by
the
fanatical
attack
to
which
she
had
just
been
a
witness
the
discord
as
she
thought
it
of
ralph
character
and
actions
had
not
been
resolved
yet
she
had
decided
in
that
moment
that
it
need
not
be
that
her
data
as
concerned
those
actions
were
insufficient
and
that
if
she
could
not
explain
at
least
she
could
trust
ralph
had
been
very
honest
she
told
herself
now
he
had
reminded
her
that
he
was
a
servant
of
cromwell
whom
many
believed
to
be
an
enemy
of
church
and
state
she
had
nodded
back
to
him
steadily
and
silently
knowing
what
would
follow
from
the
paleness
of
his
face
and
his
bright
eyes
beneath
their
wide
lids
she
had
felt
her
own
breast
rise
and
fall
and
a
pulse
begin
to
hammer
at
the
spring
of
her
throat
even
now
as
she
thought
of
it
her
heart
quickened
and
her
hands
clenched
themselves
and
then
in
one
swift
moment
it
had
come
she
had
found
her
hands
caught
fiercely
and
her
eyes
imprisoned
by
his
and
then
all
was
over
and
she
had
given
him
an
answer
in
a
word
it
had
not
been
easy
even
after
that
cecily
had
questioned
her
more
than
once
more
had
said
a
few
indiscreet
things
that
had
been
hard
to
bear
her
own
aunt
had
received
the
news
in
silence
but
that
was
over
now
the
necessary
consent
on
both
sides
had
been
given
and
here
she
was
once
more
walking
up
the
road
to
westminster
with
ralph
image
before
her
eyes
and
ralph
himself
a
hundred
yards
away
she
turned
the
last
corner
from
the
alley
passed
up
the
little
street
and
turned
again
across
the
little
cobbled
yard
that
lay
before
the
house
morris
was
at
the
door
as
she
came
up
and
he
now
stood
aside
he
seemed
doubtful
torridon
has
gentlemen
with
him
madam
then
i
will
wait
said
beatrice
serenely
and
made
a
motion
to
come
in
the
servant
still
opened
the
door
wider
and
beatrice
and
her
maid
went
through
into
the
little
parlour
on
the
right
as
she
passed
in
she
heard
voices
from
the
other
door
footsteps
went
down
the
passage
she
had
not
very
long
to
wait
there
was
the
sound
of
a
carriage
driving
up
to
the
door
presently
and
her
maid
who
sat
in
view
of
the
window
glanced
out
her
face
grew
solemn
it
is
master
cromwell
carriage
she
said
beatrice
was
conscious
of
a
vague
discomfort
master
cromwell
in
spite
of
her
efforts
was
the
shadowed
side
of
ralph
life
is
he
coming
in
she
said
the
maid
peeped
again
no
madam
the
door
of
the
room
they
were
in
was
not
quite
shut
and
there
was
still
a
faint
murmur
of
voices
from
across
the
hall
but
almost
immediately
there
was
the
sound
of
a
lifted
latch
and
then
voice
clear
and
distinct
i
will
see
to
it
my
lord
beatrice
stood
up
feeling
a
little
uneasy
she
fancied
that
perhaps
she
ought
not
to
be
here
she
remembered
now
the
servant
slight
air
of
unwillingness
to
let
her
in
there
was
a
footfall
in
the
hall
and
the
sound
of
talking
and
as
morris
hasty
step
came
up
the
passage
the
door
was
pushed
abruptly
open
and
ralph
was
looking
into
the
room
with
one
or
two
others
beyond
him
i
did
not
know
he
began
and
flushed
a
little
smiling
and
making
as
if
to
close
the
door
but
cromwell
face
with
its
long
upper
lip
and
grey
eyes
appeared
over
his
shoulder
and
ralph
turned
round
almost
deprecatingly
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
this
is
mistress
atherton
and
her
woman
cromwell
came
forward
into
the
room
with
a
kind
of
keen
smile
in
his
rich
dress
and
chain
mistress
beatrice
atherton
he
said
with
a
questioning
deference
and
ralph
introduced
them
to
one
another
beatrice
was
conscious
of
a
good
deal
of
awkwardness
it
was
uncomfortable
to
be
caught
here
as
if
she
had
come
to
spy
out
something
she
felt
herself
flushing
as
she
explained
that
she
had
had
no
idea
who
was
there
cromwell
looked
at
her
very
pleasantly
there
is
nothing
to
ask
pardon
for
mistress
he
said
i
knew
you
were
a
friend
of
torridon
he
has
told
me
everything
ralph
seemed
strangely
beatrice
thought
as
cromwell
congratulated
them
both
with
a
very
kindly
air
and
then
turned
towards
the
hall
again
my
lord
he
called
my
lord
then
beatrice
saw
a
tall
ecclesiastic
with
a
strangely
insignificant
but
kindly
face
with
square
drooping
lip
and
narrow
hazel
eyes
come
forward
in
his
prelate
dress
and
at
the
sight
of
him
her
eyes
grew
hard
and
her
lips
tight
my
lord
said
cromwell
this
is
mistress
beatrice
torridon
the
prelate
put
out
his
hand
smiling
faintly
with
the
ring
uppermost
to
be
kissed
beatrice
stood
perfectly
still
she
could
see
ralph
at
an
angle
looking
at
her
imploringly
you
know
my
lord
of
canterbury
said
cromwell
in
an
explanatory
voice
i
know
my
lord
of
canterbury
said
beatrice
there
was
a
dead
silence
for
a
moment
and
then
a
faint
whimper
from
the
maid
cranmer
dropped
his
hand
but
still
smiled
turning
to
ralph
we
must
be
gone
torridon
master
cromwell
has
very
kindly
cromwell
who
had
stood
amazed
for
a
moment
turned
round
at
his
name
yes
he
said
to
ralph
my
lord
is
to
come
with
me
and
you
will
be
at
my
house
he
said
to
the
girl
looking
at
her
with
an
amused
interest
that
made
her
flush
and
as
cranmer
passed
out
of
the
to
the
carriage
with
ralph
beside
him
he
spoke
very
softly
you
are
like
the
others
mistress
he
said
and
shook
his
heavy
head
at
her
like
an
indulgent
father
then
he
too
turned
and
went
out
beatrice
went
across
at
once
to
the
other
room
leaving
her
maid
behind
and
stood
by
the
hearth
as
ralph
came
in
she
heard
the
door
close
and
his
footstep
come
across
the
floor
beside
her
beatrice
said
ralph
she
turned
round
and
looked
at
him
you
must
not
scold
me
she
said
with
great
serenity
you
must
leave
me
my
conscience
ralph
face
cleared
instantly
no
no
he
said
i
feared
it
would
be
the
other
way
a
married
priest
they
say
remarked
the
girl
but
without
bitterness
i
daresay
my
darling
but
but
i
have
more
tenderness
for
marriage
than
i
had
beatrice
black
eyes
just
flickered
with
amusement
yes
but
priests
she
said
yes
even
priests
said
ralph
smiling
back
beatrice
turned
to
a
chair
and
sat
down
i
suppose
i
must
not
ask
any
questions
she
said
glancing
up
for
a
moment
at
ralph
steady
eyes
she
thought
he
looked
a
little
uneasy
still
oh
i
scarcely
know
said
ralph
and
he
took
a
turn
across
the
room
and
came
back
she
waited
knowing
that
she
had
already
put
her
question
and
secretly
pleased
that
he
knew
it
and
was
perplexed
by
it
i
scarcely
know
he
said
again
standing
opposite
her
well
yes
all
will
know
it
soon
oh
i
can
wait
till
then
said
beatrice
quickly
not
sure
whether
she
were
annoyed
or
not
by
being
told
a
secret
of
such
a
common
nature
ralph
glanced
at
her
not
sure
either
i
am
afraid
he
began
no
no
she
said
ashamed
of
her
doubt
i
do
not
wish
to
know
i
can
wait
i
will
tell
you
said
ralph
he
went
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
opposite
crossing
his
legs
it
is
about
the
visitation
of
the
religious
houses
i
am
to
go
with
the
visitors
in
september
beatrice
felt
a
sudden
and
rather
distressed
interest
but
she
showed
no
sign
of
it
ah
yes
she
said
softly
and
what
will
be
your
work
ralph
was
reassured
by
her
tone
we
are
to
go
to
the
southern
province
i
am
with
layton
party
we
shall
make
enquiries
of
the
state
of
religion
how
it
is
observed
and
so
forth
and
report
to
master
cromwell
beatrice
looked
down
in
a
slightly
way
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
said
ralph
his
tone
a
mixture
of
amusement
and
pride
she
looked
up
silently
yes
i
knew
it
was
so
he
went
on
smiling
straight
at
her
you
are
wondering
what
in
the
world
i
know
about
religious
houses
but
i
have
a
brother
a
shadow
went
over
her
face
ralph
saw
she
did
not
like
the
allusion
besides
he
went
on
again
they
need
intelligent
men
not
ecclesiastics
for
this
business
but
dr
layton
questioned
beatrice
well
you
might
call
him
an
ecclesiastic
but
you
would
scarcely
guess
it
from
himself
and
no
man
could
call
him
a
partisan
on
that
side
he
would
do
better
in
one
of
his
rectories
i
should
think
said
beatrice
well
that
is
not
my
business
observed
ralph
and
what
is
your
business
well
to
ride
round
the
country
examine
the
religious
and
make
enquiries
of
the
country
folk
beatrice
began
to
tap
her
foot
very
softly
ralph
glanced
down
at
the
bright
buckle
and
smiled
in
spite
of
himself
the
girl
went
on
and
by
whose
authority
by
his
grace
authority
and
dr
cranmer
well
yes
so
far
as
he
has
any
i
see
said
beatrice
and
cast
her
eyes
down
again
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
or
two
you
see
too
that
i
can
not
withdraw
explained
ralph
a
little
distressed
at
her
air
it
is
part
of
my
duty
oh
i
understand
that
said
beatrice
and
so
long
as
i
act
justly
there
is
no
harm
done
the
girl
was
silent
you
understand
that
he
asked
i
suppose
i
do
said
beatrice
slowly
ralph
made
a
slight
impatient
movement
no
wait
said
the
girl
i
do
understand
if
i
can
not
trust
you
i
had
better
never
have
known
you
i
do
understand
that
i
can
trust
you
though
i
can
not
understand
how
you
can
do
such
work
she
raised
her
eyes
slowly
to
his
and
ralph
as
he
looked
into
them
saw
that
she
was
perfectly
sincere
and
speaking
without
bitterness
sweetheart
he
said
i
could
not
have
taken
that
from
any
but
you
but
i
know
that
you
are
true
and
mean
no
more
nor
less
than
your
words
you
do
trust
me
why
yes
said
the
girl
and
smiled
at
him
as
he
took
her
in
his
arms
when
she
had
gone
again
ralph
had
a
difficult
quarter
of
an
hour
he
knew
that
she
trusted
him
but
was
it
not
simply
because
she
did
not
know
he
sat
and
pondered
the
talk
he
had
had
with
cromwell
and
the
archbishop
neither
had
expressly
said
that
what
was
wanted
was
adverse
testimony
against
the
religious
houses
but
that
ralph
knew
very
well
was
what
was
asked
of
him
they
had
talked
a
great
deal
about
the
corruptions
that
the
visitors
would
no
doubt
find
and
cranmer
had
told
a
story
or
two
with
an
appearance
of
great
distress
of
scandalous
cases
that
had
come
under
his
own
notice
cromwell
too
had
pointed
out
that
such
corruptions
did
incalculable
evil
and
that
an
immoral
monk
did
far
more
harm
in
a
countryside
than
his
holy
brethren
could
do
of
good
both
had
said
a
word
too
about
the
luxury
and
riches
to
be
found
in
the
houses
of
those
who
professed
poverty
and
of
the
injury
done
to
christ
holy
religion
by
such
insincere
pretences
ralph
knew
too
from
previous
meetings
with
the
other
visitors
the
kind
of
work
for
which
such
men
would
be
likely
to
be
selected
there
was
richard
layton
first
whom
ralph
was
to
join
in
sussex
at
the
end
of
september
a
priest
who
had
two
or
three
preferments
and
notoriously
neglected
them
ralph
had
taken
a
serious
dislike
to
him
he
was
a
coarse
man
who
knew
how
to
cringe
effectively
and
ralph
had
listened
to
him
talking
to
cromwell
with
some
dismay
but
he
would
be
to
a
large
extent
independent
of
him
and
only
in
his
company
at
some
of
the
larger
houses
that
needed
more
than
one
visitor
thomas
legh
too
a
young
doctor
of
civil
law
was
scarcely
more
attractive
he
was
a
man
of
an
extraordinary
arrogance
carrying
his
head
high
and
looking
about
him
with
insolently
drooping
eyes
ralph
had
been
at
once
amused
and
angry
to
see
him
go
out
into
the
street
after
his
interview
with
cromwell
where
his
horse
and
footmen
awaited
him
and
to
watch
him
ride
off
with
the
airs
of
a
vulgar
prince
the
welshman
ap
rice
too
and
the
bully
london
were
hardly
persons
whom
he
desired
as
associates
and
the
others
were
not
much
better
and
ralph
found
himself
feeling
a
little
thankful
that
none
of
these
men
had
been
in
his
house
just
now
when
cromwell
and
the
archbishop
had
called
in
the
former
carriage
and
when
beatrice
had
met
them
there
ralph
had
a
moment
ten
minutes
after
beatrice
had
left
when
he
was
inclined
to
snatch
up
his
hat
and
go
after
cromwell
to
tell
him
to
do
his
own
dirty
work
but
his
training
had
told
and
he
had
laughed
at
the
folly
of
the
thought
why
of
course
the
work
had
to
be
done
england
was
rotten
with
dreams
and
superstition
ecclesiasticism
had
corrupted
genuine
human
life
and
national
sanity
could
not
be
restored
except
by
a
violent
process
innocent
persons
would
no
doubt
suffer
innocent
according
to
conscience
but
guilty
against
the
commonwealth
every
great
movement
towards
good
was
bound
to
be
attended
by
individual
catastrophes
but
it
was
the
part
of
a
strong
man
to
carry
out
principles
and
despise
details
the
work
had
to
be
done
it
was
better
then
that
there
should
be
at
least
one
respectable
workman
of
course
such
a
work
needed
coarse
men
to
carry
it
out
it
was
bound
to
be
accompanied
by
some
brutality
and
his
own
presence
there
might
do
something
to
keep
the
brutality
within
limits
and
as
for
beatrice
well
beatrice
did
not
yet
understand
if
she
understood
all
as
he
did
she
would
sympathise
for
she
was
strong
too
besides
he
had
held
her
in
his
arms
just
now
and
he
knew
that
love
was
king
but
he
sat
for
ten
minutes
more
in
silence
staring
with
unseeing
eyes
at
the
huddled
roofs
opposite
and
the
clear
sky
over
them
and
the
point
of
the
quill
in
his
fingers
was
split
and
cracked
when
morris
looked
in
to
see
if
his
master
wanted
anything
chapter
ii
the
beginning
of
the
visitation
it
was
on
a
wet
foggy
morning
in
october
that
ralph
set
out
with
morris
and
a
couple
more
servants
to
join
layton
in
the
sussex
visitation
he
rode
alone
in
front
and
considered
as
he
went
the
visitation
itself
cromwell
had
told
him
almost
explicitly
was
in
pursuance
of
the
king
policy
to
get
the
religious
houses
which
were
considered
to
be
the
strongholds
of
the
papal
power
in
england
under
the
authority
of
the
crown
and
also
to
obtain
from
them
reinforcements
of
the
royal
funds
which
were
running
sorely
low
the
crops
were
most
disappointing
this
year
and
the
king
tenants
were
wholly
unable
to
pay
their
rents
and
it
had
been
thought
wiser
to
make
up
the
deficit
from
ecclesiastical
wealth
rather
than
to
exasperate
the
commons
by
a
direct
call
upon
their
resources
so
far
he
knew
very
well
the
attempt
to
get
the
religious
houses
into
the
king
power
had
only
partially
succeeded
bishop
fisher
influence
had
availed
to
stave
off
the
fulfilment
of
the
royal
intentions
up
to
the
present
and
the
oath
of
supremacy
in
which
to
a
large
extent
the
key
of
the
situation
lay
had
been
by
no
means
universally
accepted
now
however
the
scheme
was
to
be
pushed
forward
and
as
a
preparation
for
it
it
was
proposed
to
visit
every
monastery
and
convent
in
the
kingdom
and
to
render
account
first
of
the
temporal
wealth
of
each
and
then
of
the
submissiveness
of
its
inmates
and
as
cromwell
had
hinted
to
ralph
anything
that
could
damage
the
character
of
the
religious
would
not
be
unacceptable
evidence
ralph
was
aware
that
the
scheme
in
which
he
was
engaged
was
supported
in
two
ways
first
by
the
suspension
of
episcopal
authority
during
the
course
of
the
visitation
and
secondly
by
the
vast
powers
committed
to
the
visitors
in
one
of
the
strapped
on
to
horse
was
a
sheaf
of
papers
containing
articles
of
enquiry
and
injunctions
as
well
as
certificates
from
the
king
endowing
ralph
with
what
was
practically
papal
jurisdiction
he
was
authorised
to
release
from
their
vows
all
religious
who
desired
it
and
ordered
to
dismiss
all
who
had
been
professed
under
twenty
years
of
age
or
who
were
at
the
present
date
under
years
old
besides
this
he
was
commissioned
to
enforce
the
enclosure
with
the
utmost
rigour
to
set
porters
at
the
doors
to
see
that
it
was
observed
and
to
encourage
all
who
had
any
grievance
against
their
superiors
to
forward
complaints
through
himself
to
cromwell
ralph
understood
well
enough
the
first
object
of
these
regulations
namely
to
make
monastic
life
impossible
it
was
pretty
evident
that
a
rigorous
confinement
would
breed
discontent
which
in
its
turn
would
be
bound
to
escape
through
the
which
the
power
of
appeal
provided
thus
bringing
about
a
state
of
anarchy
within
the
house
and
the
tightening
of
the
hold
of
the
civil
authority
upon
the
religious
lastly
the
visitors
were
authorised
to
seize
any
church
furniture
or
jewels
that
they
might
judge
would
be
better
in
secular
custody
once
more
he
had
learned
both
from
cromwell
and
from
his
own
experience
at
paul
cross
how
the
laity
itself
was
being
carefully
prepared
for
the
blow
that
was
impending
by
an
army
of
selected
preachers
who
could
be
trusted
to
say
what
they
were
told
only
a
few
days
before
ralph
had
halted
his
horse
at
the
outskirts
of
a
huge
crowd
gathered
round
paul
cross
and
had
listened
to
a
torrent
of
vituperation
poured
out
by
a
famous
orator
against
the
mendicant
friars
and
from
the
faces
and
exclamations
of
the
people
round
him
he
had
learned
once
more
that
greed
was
awake
in
england
it
was
a
somewhat
dismal
ride
that
he
had
this
day
the
sky
was
heavy
and
overcast
it
rained
constantly
and
the
roads
were
in
a
more
dreary
condition
even
than
usual
he
splashed
along
through
the
mud
with
his
servants
behind
him
wrapped
in
his
cloak
and
his
own
thoughts
were
not
of
a
sufficient
cheerfulness
to
compensate
for
the
external
discomforts
his
political
plane
of
thought
was
shot
by
a
personal
idea
he
guessed
that
he
would
have
to
commit
himself
in
a
manner
that
he
had
never
done
before
and
was
not
wholly
confident
that
he
would
be
able
to
explain
matters
satisfactorily
to
beatrice
besides
the
particular
district
to
which
he
was
appointed
included
first
lewes
where
chris
would
have
an
eye
on
his
doings
and
secondly
the
little
benedictine
house
of
rusper
where
his
sister
margaret
had
been
lately
professed
and
he
wondered
what
exactly
would
be
his
relation
with
his
own
family
when
his
work
was
done
but
for
the
main
object
of
his
visitation
he
had
little
but
sympathy
it
was
good
he
thought
that
a
scouring
should
be
made
of
these
idle
houses
and
their
inmates
made
more
profitable
to
the
commonwealth
and
lastly
whether
or
no
he
sympathised
it
would
be
fatal
to
his
career
to
refuse
the
work
offered
to
him
as
he
did
not
feel
very
confident
at
first
he
had
arranged
to
meet
with
layton
party
at
the
premonstratension
abbey
of
durford
situated
at
the
borders
of
sussex
and
hampshire
and
there
learn
the
exact
methods
to
be
employed
in
the
visitation
but
it
was
a
long
ride
and
he
took
two
days
over
it
sleeping
on
the
way
at
waverly
in
the
cistercian
house
this
had
not
yet
been
visited
as
layton
was
riding
up
gradually
from
the
west
country
but
the
rumour
of
his
intentions
had
already
reached
there
and
ralph
was
received
with
a
pathetic
deference
as
one
of
the
representatives
of
the
royal
commission
the
abbot
was
a
kindly
nervous
man
and
welcomed
ralph
with
every
sign
of
respect
at
the
gate
of
the
abbey
giving
contradictory
orders
about
the
horses
and
the
entertainment
of
the
guests
to
his
servants
who
seemed
in
very
little
awe
of
him
after
mass
and
breakfast
on
the
following
morning
the
abbot
came
into
the
and
begged
for
a
short
interview
he
apologised
first
for
the
poorness
of
the
entertainment
saying
that
he
had
done
his
best
ralph
answered
courteously
and
the
other
went
on
immediately
standing
deferentially
before
the
chair
where
ralph
was
seated
and
fingering
his
cross
i
hope
torridon
that
it
will
be
you
who
will
visit
us
you
have
found
us
all
unprepared
and
you
know
that
we
are
doing
our
best
to
keep
our
rule
i
hope
you
found
nothing
that
was
not
to
your
liking
ralph
bowed
and
smiled
i
would
sooner
that
it
were
you
went
on
the
abbot
and
not
another
that
visited
us
layton
he
stopped
abruptly
embarrassed
you
have
heard
something
of
him
questioned
ralph
i
know
nothing
against
him
said
the
other
hastily
except
that
they
say
that
he
is
sharp
with
us
poor
monks
i
fear
he
would
find
a
great
deal
here
not
to
his
taste
my
authority
has
been
so
much
weakened
of
late
i
have
some
discontented
brethren
not
more
than
one
or
two
torridon
and
they
have
learned
that
they
will
be
able
to
appeal
now
to
the
king
grace
and
get
themselves
set
free
and
they
have
ruined
the
discipline
of
the
house
i
do
not
wish
to
hide
anything
sir
you
see
but
i
am
terribly
afraid
that
layton
may
be
displeased
i
am
very
sorry
my
lord
said
ralph
but
i
fear
i
shall
not
be
coming
here
again
the
abbot
face
fell
but
you
will
speak
for
us
sir
to
layton
i
heard
you
say
you
would
be
seeing
him
ralph
promised
to
do
his
best
and
was
overwhelmed
with
thanks
he
could
not
help
realising
some
of
the
pathos
of
the
situation
as
he
rode
on
through
the
rain
to
durford
it
was
plain
that
a
wave
of
terror
and
apprehensiveness
was
running
through
the
religious
houses
and
that
it
brought
with
it
inevitable
disorder
lives
that
would
have
been
serene
and
contented
under
other
circumstances
were
thrown
off
their
balance
by
the
rumours
of
disturbance
and
authority
was
weakened
if
the
rule
was
hard
of
observance
in
tranquil
times
it
was
infinitely
harder
when
doors
of
escape
presented
themselves
on
all
sides
and
yet
he
was
impatient
too
passive
or
wavering
characters
irritated
his
own
strong
temperament
and
he
felt
a
kind
of
anger
against
the
abbot
and
his
feeble
appeal
surely
men
who
had
nothing
else
to
do
might
manage
to
keep
their
own
subjects
in
order
and
a
weak
crying
for
pity
was
in
itself
an
argument
against
their
competence
and
meanwhile
if
he
had
known
it
he
would
have
been
still
more
incensed
for
as
he
rode
on
down
towards
the
south
west
the
abbot
and
his
monks
in
the
house
he
had
left
were
prostrate
before
the
high
altar
in
the
dark
church
each
in
his
stall
praying
for
mercy
o
god
the
heathens
are
come
into
thine
inheritance
they
murmured
they
have
defiled
thy
holy
temple
it
was
not
until
the
sun
was
going
down
in
the
stormy
west
that
ralph
rode
up
to
durford
abbey
the
rain
had
ceased
an
hour
before
sunset
and
the
wet
roofs
shone
in
the
evening
light
there
were
certain
signs
of
stir
as
he
came
up
one
or
two
idlers
were
standing
outside
the
the
door
was
wide
open
and
a
couple
of
horses
were
being
led
away
round
the
corner
inside
the
court
as
he
rode
through
he
saw
further
signs
of
confusion
half
a
dozen
packhorses
were
waiting
with
hanging
heads
outside
the
stable
door
and
an
agitated
lay
brother
was
explaining
to
a
canon
in
his
white
habit
rochet
and
cap
that
there
was
no
more
room
he
threw
out
his
hands
with
a
gesture
of
despair
towards
ralph
as
he
came
in
mother
of
god
he
said
here
is
another
of
them
the
priest
frowned
at
him
and
hurried
up
to
ralph
yes
father
said
ralph
i
am
another
of
them
the
canon
explained
that
the
stable
was
full
that
they
were
exceedingly
sorry
but
that
they
were
but
a
poor
house
and
that
he
was
glad
to
say
there
was
an
outhouse
round
the
corner
outside
where
the
beasts
could
be
lodged
but
as
for
yourself
sir
he
said
i
know
not
what
to
do
we
have
every
room
full
you
are
a
friend
of
layton
sir
i
am
one
of
the
visitors
said
ralph
you
must
make
room
the
priest
sucked
his
lips
in
i
see
nothing
for
it
he
said
layton
and
you
sir
must
share
a
room
ralph
threw
a
leg
over
the
saddle
and
slipped
to
the
ground
where
is
he
he
asked
he
is
with
my
lord
abbot
sir
he
said
will
you
come
with
me
the
canon
led
the
way
across
the
court
his
white
fur
tails
swinging
as
he
went
and
took
ralph
through
the
cloister
into
one
of
the
parlours
there
was
a
sound
of
a
high
scolding
voice
as
he
threw
open
the
door
what
in
god
name
are
ye
for
then
if
ye
have
not
hospitality
layton
turned
round
as
ralph
came
in
he
was
flushed
with
passion
his
mouth
worked
and
his
eyes
were
brutal
see
this
torridon
he
said
there
is
neither
room
for
man
or
beast
in
this
damned
abbey
the
guest
house
has
no
more
than
half
a
dozen
rooms
and
the
stable
why
it
is
not
fit
for
pigs
let
alone
the
horses
of
the
king
visitors
the
abbot
a
young
man
with
a
delicate
face
very
pale
now
and
trembling
broke
in
deprecatingly
i
am
very
sorry
gentlemen
he
said
looking
from
one
to
the
other
but
it
is
not
my
fault
it
is
in
better
repair
than
when
i
came
to
it
i
have
done
my
best
with
my
lord
abbot
of
welbeck
but
we
are
very
poor
and
he
can
give
me
no
more
layton
growled
at
him
i
do
say
it
you
man
we
shall
know
better
when
we
have
looked
into
your
accounts
but
i
have
a
word
to
say
at
welbeck
we
are
to
share
a
room
layton
put
in
ralph
at
least
the
doctor
turned
round
again
at
that
and
stormed
once
more
i
can
not
help
it
gentlemen
retorted
the
abbot
desperately
i
have
given
up
my
own
chamber
already
i
can
but
do
my
best
ralph
hastened
to
interpose
his
mind
revolted
at
this
coarse
bullying
in
spite
of
his
contempt
at
this
patient
tolerance
on
the
part
of
the
abbot
i
shall
do
very
well
my
lord
abbot
he
said
i
shall
give
no
trouble
you
may
put
me
where
you
please
the
young
prelate
looked
at
him
gratefully
we
will
do
our
best
sir
he
said
will
you
come
gentlemen
and
see
your
chambers
layton
explained
to
ralph
as
they
went
along
the
poor
little
cloister
that
he
himself
had
only
arrived
an
hour
before
i
had
a
rare
time
among
the
monks
he
whispered
and
have
some
tales
to
make
you
laugh
he
grew
impatient
again
presently
at
the
poor
furnishing
of
the
rooms
and
kicked
over
a
broken
chair
i
will
have
something
better
than
that
he
said
get
me
one
from
the
church
the
young
abbot
faced
him
what
do
you
want
of
us
layton
is
it
riches
or
poverty
which
think
you
that
religious
ought
to
have
the
priest
gave
a
bark
of
laughter
you
have
me
there
my
lord
he
said
and
nudged
ralph
they
sat
down
to
supper
presently
in
the
parlour
downstairs
a
couple
of
dishes
of
meat
and
a
bottle
of
spanish
wine
layton
grew
voluble
i
have
a
deal
to
tell
you
torridon
he
said
and
not
a
few
things
to
show
you
silver
crosses
and
such
like
but
those
we
will
look
at
i
doubt
whether
we
shall
add
much
to
it
here
though
there
is
a
that
would
look
well
on
master
cromwell
table
it
is
all
set
with
agates
but
the
tales
you
shall
have
now
my
servant
will
be
here
directly
with
the
papers
a
man
came
in
presently
with
a
bag
of
documents
and
layton
seized
them
eagerly
see
here
torridon
he
said
shaking
the
papers
on
to
the
table
here
is
a
for
the
ladies
draw
your
chair
to
the
fire
ralph
felt
an
increasing
repugnance
for
the
man
but
he
said
nothing
and
brought
up
his
seat
to
the
wide
hearth
on
which
the
logs
burned
pleasantly
in
the
cold
little
room
the
priest
lifted
the
bundle
on
to
his
lap
crossed
his
legs
comfortably
with
a
glass
of
wine
at
his
elbow
and
began
to
read
for
a
while
ralph
wondered
how
the
man
could
have
the
effrontery
to
call
his
notes
by
the
name
of
evidence
they
consisted
of
a
string
of
obscene
guesses
founded
upon
circumstances
that
were
certainly
compatible
with
guilt
but
no
less
compatible
with
innocence
there
was
a
quantity
of
gossip
gathered
from
and
coloured
by
the
most
flagrant
animus
and
even
so
the
witnesses
did
not
agree
such
sentences
as
it
is
reported
in
the
country
round
that
the
prior
is
a
lewd
man
were
frequent
in
the
course
of
the
reading
and
were
often
the
chief
evidence
offered
in
a
case
in
one
of
the
most
categorical
stories
ralph
leaned
forward
and
interrupted
forgive
me
master
layton
he
said
but
who
is
master
who
says
all
this
the
priest
waved
the
paper
in
the
air
a
monk
himself
he
said
a
monk
himself
that
is
the
cream
of
it
a
monk
exclaimed
ralph
he
was
one
till
last
year
explained
the
priest
and
then
said
the
other
he
was
expelled
the
monastery
he
knew
too
much
you
see
ralph
leaned
back
half
an
hour
later
there
was
a
change
in
his
attitude
his
doubts
were
almost
gone
the
flood
of
detail
was
too
vast
to
be
dismissed
as
wholly
irrelevant
his
imagination
was
affected
by
the
evidence
from
without
and
his
will
from
within
and
he
listened
without
hostility
telling
himself
that
he
desired
only
truth
and
justice
there
were
at
least
half
a
dozen
stories
in
the
mass
of
filthy
suspicion
that
the
priest
exultingly
poured
out
which
appeared
convincing
particularly
one
about
which
ralph
put
a
number
of
questions
in
this
there
was
first
a
quantity
of
vague
evidence
gathered
from
the
who
were
unless
layton
lied
quite
unrestrainedly
convinced
of
the
immoral
life
of
a
certain
monk
the
report
of
his
sin
had
penetrated
ten
miles
from
the
house
where
he
lived
there
was
besides
definite
testimony
from
one
of
his
fellows
precise
and
detailed
and
there
was
lastly
a
half
admission
from
the
culprit
himself
all
this
was
worked
up
with
great
skill
suggestive
epithets
were
plastered
over
the
weak
spots
in
the
evidence
clever
theories
put
forward
to
account
for
certain
incompatibilities
and
to
ralph
at
least
it
was
convincing
he
found
himself
growing
hot
with
anger
at
the
thought
of
the
hypocrisy
of
this
monk
life
here
the
fellow
had
been
living
in
gross
sin
month
after
month
and
all
the
while
standing
at
the
altar
morning
by
morning
and
going
about
in
the
habit
of
a
professed
servant
of
jesus
christ
but
i
have
kept
the
cream
till
the
last
put
in
layton
and
he
read
out
a
few
more
hideous
sentences
that
set
ralph
heart
heaving
with
disgust
he
began
now
to
feel
the
beginnings
of
that
fury
against
vice
with
which
worldly
souls
are
so
quick
to
burn
he
would
have
said
that
he
himself
professed
no
holiness
beyond
the
average
and
would
have
acknowledged
privately
at
least
that
he
was
at
any
rate
uncertain
of
the
whole
dogmatic
scheme
of
religion
but
that
he
could
not
tolerate
a
man
whose
whole
life
was
on
the
outside
confessedly
devoted
to
both
sides
of
religion
faith
and
morals
and
who
claimed
the
world
reverence
for
himself
on
the
score
of
it
he
knit
his
forehead
in
a
righteous
fury
and
his
fingers
began
to
drum
softly
on
his
layton
now
began
to
recur
to
some
of
the
first
stories
he
had
told
and
to
build
up
their
weak
places
and
now
that
ralph
was
roused
his
critical
faculty
subsided
they
appeared
more
convincing
than
before
in
the
light
of
this
later
evidence
pede
from
the
fellow
who
had
confessed
he
interpreted
the
guilt
of
those
who
had
not
the
seed
of
suspicion
sprang
quickly
in
the
soil
that
hungered
for
it
this
then
was
the
fair
religious
system
that
was
dispersed
over
england
and
this
the
interior
life
of
those
holy
looking
roofs
and
buildings
surmounted
by
the
sign
of
the
crucified
visible
in
every
town
to
point
men
to
god
when
he
saw
a
serene
monk
face
again
he
would
know
what
kind
of
soul
it
covered
he
would
understand
as
never
before
how
vice
could
wear
a
mask
of
virtue
the
whole
of
that
flimsy
evidence
that
he
had
heard
before
took
a
new
colour
those
hints
and
suspicions
and
guesses
grew
from
shadow
to
substance
those
dark
spots
were
not
casual
filth
dropped
from
above
they
were
the
symptoms
of
a
deep
internal
infection
as
layton
went
on
with
his
tales
gathered
and
garnered
with
devilish
adroitness
and
presented
as
convincingly
as
a
clever
brain
could
do
it
the
black
certainty
fell
deeper
and
deeper
on
ralph
soul
and
by
the
time
that
the
priest
chuckled
for
the
last
time
that
evening
and
gathered
up
his
papers
from
the
boards
where
they
had
fallen
one
by
one
he
had
done
his
work
in
another
soul
chapter
iii
a
house
of
ladies
they
parted
the
next
day
layton
to
waverly
where
he
proposed
to
sleep
on
saturday
night
and
ralph
to
the
convent
at
rusper
he
had
learnt
now
how
the
work
was
to
be
done
and
he
had
been
equipped
for
it
in
a
way
that
not
even
layton
himself
suspected
for
he
had
been
set
aflame
with
that
fire
with
which
so
many
hearts
were
burning
at
this
time
he
had
all
the
saint
passion
for
purity
without
the
charity
of
his
holiness
he
had
learnt
too
the
technical
details
of
his
work
those
rough
methods
by
which
men
might
be
coerced
and
the
phrases
with
which
to
gild
the
coercion
all
that
morning
he
had
sat
side
by
side
with
layton
in
the
inspecting
the
books
comparing
the
possessions
of
the
monastery
with
the
inventories
of
them
examining
witnesses
as
to
the
credibility
of
the
lists
offered
and
making
searching
enquiries
as
to
whether
any
land
or
plate
had
been
sold
after
that
when
a
silver
had
been
added
to
collection
the
religious
and
servants
and
all
else
who
cared
to
offer
evidence
on
other
matters
were
questioned
one
by
one
and
their
answers
entered
in
a
book
lastly
when
the
fees
for
the
visitation
had
been
collected
arrangements
had
been
made
which
in
the
visitors
opinion
would
be
most
serviceable
to
the
carrying
out
of
the
injunctions
fresh
officials
were
appointed
to
various
posts
and
the
abbot
himself
ordered
to
go
up
to
london
and
present
himself
to
master
cromwell
but
he
was
furnished
with
a
letter
commending
his
zeal
and
discretion
for
the
visitors
had
found
that
he
had
done
his
duty
to
the
buildings
and
lands
and
stated
that
they
had
nothing
to
complain
of
except
the
poverty
of
the
house
and
so
much
for
durford
said
layton
genially
as
he
closed
the
last
book
just
before
though
it
had
been
better
called
dirtyford
and
he
chuckled
at
his
humour
after
dinner
he
had
gone
out
with
ralph
to
see
him
mount
had
thanked
him
for
his
assistance
and
had
reminded
him
that
they
would
meet
again
at
lewes
in
the
course
of
a
month
or
so
god
speed
you
he
cried
as
the
party
rode
off
ralph
fury
had
died
to
a
glow
but
it
was
red
within
him
the
reading
last
night
had
done
its
work
well
driven
home
by
the
shrewd
conviction
of
a
man
of
the
world
experienced
in
the
ways
of
vice
it
had
not
died
with
the
dark
he
could
not
say
that
he
was
attracted
to
layton
the
priest
shocking
familiarity
with
the
more
revolting
forms
of
sin
as
well
as
his
and
brutality
made
him
a
disagreeable
character
but
ralph
had
very
little
doubt
now
that
his
judgment
on
the
religious
houses
was
a
right
one
even
the
nunneries
it
seemed
were
not
free
from
taint
there
had
been
one
or
two
terrible
tales
on
the
previous
evening
and
ralph
was
determined
to
spare
them
nothing
and
at
any
rate
to
remove
his
sister
from
their
power
he
remembered
with
satisfaction
that
she
was
below
the
age
specified
and
that
he
would
have
authority
to
dismiss
her
from
the
home
he
knew
very
little
of
margaret
and
had
scarcely
seen
her
once
in
two
years
he
had
been
already
out
in
the
world
before
she
had
ceased
to
be
a
child
and
from
what
little
he
had
seen
of
her
he
had
thought
of
her
but
as
little
more
than
a
creature
very
delicate
and
shy
always
at
her
prayers
or
trailing
about
after
nuns
with
a
pale
radiant
face
she
had
been
sent
to
rusper
for
her
education
and
he
never
saw
her
except
now
and
then
when
they
chanced
to
be
at
home
together
for
a
few
days
she
used
to
look
at
him
he
remembered
with
eyes
and
parted
lips
hardly
daring
to
speak
when
he
was
in
the
room
continually
to
be
met
with
going
from
or
to
the
tall
quiet
chapel
he
had
always
supposed
that
she
would
be
a
nun
and
had
acquiesced
in
it
in
a
cynical
sort
of
way
but
he
was
going
to
acquiesce
no
longer
now
of
course
she
would
sob
but
equally
of
course
she
would
not
dare
to
resist
he
called
morris
up
to
him
presently
as
they
emerged
from
one
of
the
bridle
paths
on
to
a
kind
of
lane
where
two
could
ride
abreast
the
servant
had
seemed
oddly
silent
that
morning
we
are
going
to
rusper
said
ralph
yes
sir
mistress
margaret
is
there
yes
sir
she
will
come
away
with
us
i
may
have
to
send
you
on
to
overfield
with
her
you
must
find
a
horse
for
her
somehow
yes
sir
there
was
silence
between
the
two
for
a
minute
or
two
morris
had
answered
with
as
much
composure
as
if
he
had
been
told
to
brush
a
coat
ralph
began
to
wonder
what
he
really
felt
what
do
you
think
of
all
this
morris
he
asked
in
a
moment
or
two
the
servant
was
silent
till
ralph
glanced
at
him
impatiently
it
is
not
for
me
to
have
an
opinion
sir
said
mr
morris
ralph
gave
a
very
short
laugh
you
have
heard
what
i
have
he
said
or
you
would
soon
have
an
opinion
yes
sir
said
morris
as
impassively
as
before
i
tell
you
and
then
ralph
broke
off
and
rode
on
silent
and
moody
morris
gradually
let
his
horse
fall
back
behind
his
master
they
began
to
come
towards
rusper
as
the
evening
drew
in
by
a
bridle
path
that
led
from
the
west
and
on
arriving
at
the
village
found
that
they
had
overshot
their
mark
and
ought
to
have
turned
sooner
the
nunnery
a
man
told
them
was
a
mile
away
to
the
ralph
made
a
few
enquiries
and
learnt
that
it
was
a
smallish
house
and
that
it
was
scarcely
likely
that
room
could
be
found
for
his
party
of
four
so
he
left
morris
to
make
enquiries
for
lodgings
in
the
village
and
himself
rode
on
alone
to
the
nunnery
past
the
church
and
the
timberhouses
it
was
a
bad
road
and
his
tired
horse
had
to
pick
his
way
very
slowly
so
that
it
was
nearly
dark
before
he
came
to
his
destination
and
the
pointed
roofs
rose
before
him
against
the
faintly
luminous
western
sky
there
were
lights
in
one
or
two
windows
as
he
came
up
that
looked
warm
and
homely
in
the
chill
darkness
and
as
he
sat
on
his
horse
listening
to
the
jangle
of
the
bell
within
just
a
breath
of
doubtfulness
touched
his
heart
for
a
moment
as
he
thought
of
the
peaceful
that
lay
packed
within
those
walls
and
of
the
errand
on
which
he
had
come
but
the
memory
of
the
tales
he
had
heard
haunted
him
still
and
he
spoke
in
a
harsh
voice
as
the
shutter
slid
back
and
a
little
square
of
light
appeared
in
the
black
doorway
i
am
one
of
the
king
visitors
he
said
let
my
lady
abbess
know
i
am
here
i
must
speak
with
her
there
was
a
stifled
sound
behind
the
grating
and
ralph
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
pair
of
eyes
looking
at
him
then
the
square
grew
dark
again
it
was
a
minute
or
two
before
anything
further
happened
and
ralph
as
he
sat
cold
and
hungry
on
his
horse
began
to
grow
impatient
his
hand
was
on
the
twisted
iron
handle
to
ring
again
fiercely
when
there
was
a
step
within
and
a
light
once
more
shone
out
who
is
it
said
an
old
woman
voice
with
a
note
of
anxiety
in
it
i
have
sent
word
in
said
ralph
peevishly
that
i
am
one
of
the
king
visitors
i
should
be
obliged
if
i
might
not
be
kept
here
all
night
there
was
a
moment
silence
the
horse
sighed
sonorously
how
am
i
to
know
sir
said
the
voice
again
because
i
tell
you
so
snapped
ralph
and
if
more
is
wanted
my
name
is
torridon
you
have
a
sister
of
mine
in
there
there
was
an
exclamation
from
within
and
the
sound
of
whispering
and
then
hasty
footsteps
went
softly
across
the
paved
court
inside
the
voice
spoke
again
i
ask
your
pardon
sir
but
have
you
any
paper
or
ralph
snatched
out
a
document
of
identification
and
leaned
forward
from
his
horse
to
pass
it
through
the
opening
he
felt
trembling
fingers
take
it
from
him
and
a
moment
later
heard
returning
footsteps
there
was
a
rustle
of
paper
and
then
a
whisper
within
well
my
dear
something
shifted
in
the
bright
square
and
it
grew
gloomy
as
a
face
pressed
up
against
the
bars
then
again
it
shifted
and
the
light
shone
out
and
a
flutter
of
whispers
followed
really
madam
began
ralph
but
there
was
the
jingle
of
keys
and
the
sound
of
panting
and
almost
immediately
a
bolt
shot
back
followed
by
the
noise
of
a
key
turning
a
chorus
of
whispers
broke
out
and
a
scurry
of
footsteps
and
then
the
door
opened
inwards
and
a
little
old
woman
stood
there
in
a
black
habit
her
face
swathed
in
white
above
and
below
the
others
had
vanished
i
am
very
sorry
torridon
to
have
kept
you
at
the
door
but
we
have
to
be
very
careful
will
you
bring
your
horse
in
sir
ralph
was
a
little
abashed
by
the
sudden
development
of
the
situation
and
explained
that
he
had
only
come
to
announce
his
arrival
he
had
supposed
that
there
would
not
be
room
at
the
nunnery
but
we
have
a
little
here
announced
the
old
lady
with
a
dignified
air
and
room
for
your
horse
ralph
hesitated
but
he
was
tired
and
hungry
come
in
torridon
you
had
better
dismount
and
lead
your
horse
in
sister
anne
will
see
to
it
well
if
you
are
sure
began
ralph
again
slipping
a
foot
out
of
the
stirrup
i
am
sure
said
the
abbess
and
stood
aside
for
him
and
his
beast
to
pass
there
was
a
little
court
lighted
by
a
single
lamp
burning
within
a
window
with
the
nunnery
itself
on
one
side
and
a
small
cottage
on
the
other
beyond
the
latter
rose
the
roofs
of
an
outhouse
as
ralph
came
in
the
door
from
the
nunnery
opened
again
and
a
lay
sister
came
out
hastily
she
moved
straight
across
and
took
the
horse
by
the
bridle
give
him
a
good
meal
sister
said
the
abbess
and
went
past
ralph
to
the
door
of
the
come
in
torridon
there
will
be
lights
immediately
in
half
an
hour
ralph
found
himself
at
supper
in
the
a
bright
fire
crackled
on
the
hearth
a
couple
of
candles
burned
on
the
table
and
a
pair
of
old
darned
green
curtains
hung
across
the
low
window
the
abbess
came
in
when
he
had
finished
dismissed
the
who
had
waited
on
him
and
sat
down
herself
you
shall
see
your
sister
torridon
she
said
it
is
a
little
late
now
i
have
sent
the
boy
up
to
the
village
for
your
servant
he
can
sleep
in
this
room
if
you
wish
i
fear
we
have
no
room
for
more
ralph
watched
her
as
she
talked
she
was
very
old
with
hanging
cheeks
and
solemn
little
eyes
for
she
peered
at
him
now
and
again
across
the
candles
her
upper
lip
was
covered
with
a
slight
growth
of
dark
hair
she
seemed
strangely
harmless
and
ralph
had
another
prick
of
compunction
as
he
thought
of
the
news
he
had
to
give
her
on
the
morrow
he
wondered
how
much
she
knew
we
are
so
glad
it
is
you
torridon
that
have
come
to
visit
us
we
feared
it
might
be
layton
we
have
heard
sad
stories
of
him
ralph
hardened
his
heart
he
has
only
done
his
duty
reverend
mother
he
said
oh
but
you
can
not
have
heard
exclaimed
the
old
lady
he
has
robbed
several
of
our
houses
we
hear
even
the
altar
itself
and
he
has
turned
away
some
of
our
nuns
ralph
was
silent
he
thought
he
would
at
least
leave
the
old
lady
in
peace
for
this
last
night
she
seemed
to
want
no
answer
but
went
on
expatiating
on
the
horrors
that
were
happening
round
them
the
wicked
accusations
brought
against
the
religious
and
the
divine
vengeance
that
would
surely
fall
on
those
who
were
responsible
finally
she
turned
and
questioned
him
with
a
mingling
of
deference
and
dignity
what
do
you
wish
from
us
torridon
you
must
tell
me
that
i
may
see
that
everything
is
in
order
ralph
was
secretly
amused
by
her
air
of
innocent
assurance
that
is
my
business
reverend
mother
i
must
ask
for
all
the
books
of
the
house
with
the
account
of
any
sales
you
may
have
effected
properly
recorded
i
must
have
a
list
of
the
inmates
of
the
house
with
a
statement
of
any
corrodies
attached
and
the
names
and
ages
and
dates
of
profession
of
all
the
religious
the
abbess
blinked
for
a
moment
yes
torridon
you
will
allow
me
of
course
to
see
all
your
papers
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
be
certified
that
all
your
part
is
in
order
ralph
smiled
a
little
grimly
you
shall
see
all
that
he
said
and
then
there
is
more
that
i
must
ask
but
that
will
do
for
a
beginning
when
i
have
shown
you
my
papers
you
will
see
what
it
is
that
i
want
there
was
a
peal
at
the
bell
outside
the
abbess
turned
her
head
and
waited
till
there
was
a
noise
of
bolts
and
unlocking
that
will
be
your
man
sir
will
you
have
him
in
now
mr
torridon
ralph
assented
and
then
he
must
look
at
the
horses
to
see
that
all
is
as
you
wish
morris
came
in
a
moment
later
and
bowed
with
great
deference
to
the
little
old
lady
who
enquired
his
name
when
you
have
finished
with
your
man
torridon
perhaps
you
will
allow
him
to
ring
for
me
at
the
door
opposite
i
will
go
with
him
to
see
the
horses
morris
had
brought
with
him
the
mass
of
his
master
papers
and
when
he
had
set
these
out
and
prepared
the
bedroom
that
opened
out
of
the
he
asked
leave
to
go
across
and
fetch
the
abbess
ralph
busied
himself
for
or
so
in
running
over
the
articles
and
injunctions
once
more
and
satisfying
himself
that
he
was
perfect
in
his
business
and
he
was
just
beginning
to
wonder
why
his
servant
had
not
reappeared
when
the
door
opened
once
more
and
morris
slipped
in
my
horse
is
a
little
lame
sir
he
said
i
have
been
putting
on
a
poultice
ralph
glanced
up
he
will
be
fit
to
travel
i
suppose
in
a
day
or
two
mr
ralph
well
that
will
do
we
shall
be
here
till
monday
at
least
ralph
could
not
sleep
very
well
that
night
the
thought
of
his
business
troubled
him
a
little
it
would
have
been
easier
if
the
abbess
had
been
either
more
submissive
or
more
defiant
but
her
air
of
mingled
courtesy
and
dignity
affected
him
her
innocence
too
had
something
touching
in
it
and
her
apparent
ignorance
of
what
his
visit
meant
he
had
supped
excellently
at
her
expense
waited
on
by
a
cheerful
sister
and
well
served
from
the
kitchen
and
cellar
and
the
reverend
mother
herself
had
come
in
and
talked
sensibly
and
bravely
he
pictured
to
himself
what
life
must
be
like
through
the
nunnery
wall
opposite
how
brisk
and
punctual
it
must
be
and
at
the
same
time
homely
and
caressing
and
it
was
his
hand
that
was
to
pull
down
the
first
prop
there
would
no
doubt
be
three
or
four
nuns
below
age
who
must
be
dismissed
and
probably
there
would
be
a
few
treasures
to
be
carried
off
a
processional
crucifix
perhaps
such
as
he
had
seen
in
collection
and
a
rich
chalice
or
two
used
on
great
days
his
own
sister
too
must
be
one
of
those
who
must
go
how
would
the
little
old
abbess
behave
herself
then
what
would
she
say
yet
he
comforted
himself
as
he
lay
there
in
the
clean
room
staring
at
the
tiny
crockery
stoup
gleaming
against
the
by
recollecting
the
principle
on
which
he
had
come
possibly
a
few
innocents
would
have
to
suffer
a
few
old
hearts
be
broken
but
it
was
for
a
man
to
take
such
things
in
his
day
work
and
then
as
he
remembered
layton
tales
his
heart
grew
hot
and
hard
again
chapter
iv
an
unexpected
meeting
the
enquiry
was
to
be
made
in
the
on
the
next
morning
ralph
went
to
mass
first
at
nine
which
was
said
by
a
priest
from
the
parish
church
who
acted
as
chaplain
to
the
convent
and
had
a
chair
set
for
him
outside
the
nuns
choir
from
which
he
could
see
the
altar
and
the
tall
pointed
window
and
then
after
some
refreshment
in
the
spread
out
his
papers
and
sat
enthroned
behind
a
couple
of
tables
as
at
a
tribunal
morris
stood
deferentially
by
his
chair
as
the
examination
was
conducted
ralph
was
a
little
taken
aback
by
the
bearing
of
the
abbess
in
the
course
of
the
enquiry
when
he
was
perplexed
by
one
or
two
of
the
records
she
rose
from
her
chair
before
the
table
and
came
round
to
his
side
drawing
up
a
seat
as
she
did
so
ralph
could
hardly
tell
her
to
go
back
but
his
magisterial
air
was
a
little
affected
by
having
one
whom
he
almost
considered
as
a
culprit
sitting
judicially
beside
him
it
is
better
for
me
to
be
here
she
said
i
can
explain
more
easily
so
there
was
a
little
orchard
that
the
nuns
had
sold
in
the
previous
year
and
ralph
asked
for
an
explanation
it
came
from
the
kingsford
family
she
said
serenely
it
was
useless
to
us
but
began
the
inquisitor
we
needed
some
new
vestments
she
went
on
you
will
understand
torridon
that
it
was
necessary
for
us
to
sell
it
we
are
not
rich
at
all
there
was
nothing
else
that
called
for
comment
except
the
manner
in
which
the
books
were
kept
ralph
suggested
some
other
method
dame
agnes
has
her
own
ways
said
the
old
lady
we
must
not
disturb
her
and
dame
agnes
assumed
a
profound
and
financial
air
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
presently
ralph
put
a
mark
in
the
inventory
against
a
cope
of
gold
bawdekin
and
requested
that
it
might
be
brought
the
rose
at
a
word
from
the
abbess
and
went
out
returning
presently
with
the
vestment
she
unfolded
the
coverings
and
spread
it
out
on
the
table
before
ralph
it
was
a
magnificent
piece
of
work
of
shimmering
gold
with
orphreys
embroidered
with
arms
and
she
stroked
out
its
folds
with
obvious
pride
these
are
warham
arms
observed
the
abbess
you
know
them
torridon
we
worked
these
the
month
before
his
death
ralph
nodded
briskly
will
you
kindly
leave
it
here
reverend
mother
he
said
i
wish
to
see
it
again
presently
the
abbess
gave
no
hint
of
discomposure
but
signed
to
the
sacristan
to
place
it
over
a
chair
at
one
side
there
were
a
couple
of
other
things
that
ralph
presently
caused
to
be
fetched
and
laid
aside
a
precious
mitre
with
a
couple
of
cameos
in
front
and
bordered
with
emeralds
and
a
censer
with
silver
filigree
work
then
came
a
more
difficult
business
i
wish
to
see
the
nuns
one
by
one
reverend
mother
he
said
i
must
ask
you
to
withdraw
the
abbess
gave
him
a
quick
look
and
then
rose
very
well
sir
i
will
send
them
in
and
she
went
out
with
morris
behind
her
they
came
in
one
by
one
and
sat
down
before
the
table
with
downcast
eyes
and
hands
hidden
beneath
their
scapulars
and
all
told
the
same
tale
except
one
they
had
nothing
to
complain
of
they
were
happy
the
rule
was
carefully
observed
there
were
no
scandals
to
be
revealed
they
asked
nothing
but
to
be
left
in
peace
but
there
was
one
who
came
in
nervously
and
anxiously
towards
the
end
a
woman
with
quick
black
eyes
who
glanced
up
and
down
and
at
the
door
as
she
sat
down
ralph
put
the
usual
questions
i
wish
to
be
released
sir
she
said
i
am
weary
of
the
life
and
the
she
stopped
and
glanced
swiftly
up
again
at
the
commissioner
well
said
ralph
the
papistical
ways
she
said
ralph
felt
a
sudden
distrust
of
the
woman
but
he
hardened
his
heart
he
set
a
mark
opposite
her
name
she
had
been
professed
ten
years
he
saw
by
the
list
very
well
he
said
i
will
tell
my
lady
abbess
she
still
hesitated
a
moment
there
will
be
a
provision
for
me
she
asked
there
will
be
a
provision
said
ralph
a
little
grimly
he
was
authorised
to
offer
in
such
cases
a
secular
dress
and
a
sum
of
five
shillings
lastly
came
in
margaret
herself
ralph
hardly
knew
her
he
had
been
unable
to
distinguish
her
at
mass
and
even
now
as
she
faced
him
in
her
black
habit
and
white
it
was
hard
to
be
certain
of
her
identity
but
memory
and
sight
were
gradually
reconciled
he
remembered
her
delicate
eyebrows
and
thin
straight
lips
and
when
she
spoke
he
knew
her
voice
they
talked
a
minute
or
two
about
their
home
but
ralph
did
not
dare
to
say
too
much
considering
what
he
had
yet
to
say
i
must
ask
you
the
questions
he
said
at
last
smiling
at
her
she
looked
up
at
him
nervously
and
dropped
her
eyes
once
more
she
nodded
or
shook
her
head
in
silence
at
each
enquiry
until
at
last
one
bearing
upon
the
morals
of
the
house
came
up
then
she
looked
swiftly
up
once
more
and
ralph
saw
that
her
grey
eyes
were
terrified
you
must
tell
me
he
said
and
put
the
question
again
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
she
answered
staring
at
him
bewildered
ralph
went
on
immediately
to
the
next
at
last
he
reached
the
crisis
margaret
he
said
i
have
something
to
tell
you
he
stopped
and
began
to
play
with
his
pen
he
had
seldom
felt
so
embarrassed
as
now
in
the
presence
of
this
shy
sister
of
his
of
whom
he
knew
so
little
he
could
not
look
at
her
margaret
you
know
you
you
are
under
age
the
king
grace
has
ordered
that
all
under
twenty
years
of
age
are
to
leave
their
convents
there
was
a
dead
silence
ralph
was
enraged
with
his
own
weakness
he
had
begun
the
morning
work
with
such
determination
but
the
strange
sweet
atmosphere
of
the
house
the
file
of
women
coming
in
one
by
one
with
their
air
of
innocence
and
defencelessness
had
affected
him
in
spite
of
himself
his
religious
side
had
asserted
itself
and
he
found
himself
almost
tremulous
now
he
made
a
great
effort
at
and
looked
up
with
hard
bright
eyes
at
his
sister
there
must
be
no
crying
or
rebellion
he
said
you
must
come
with
me
i
shall
send
you
to
overfield
still
margaret
said
nothing
she
was
staring
at
him
now
with
parted
lips
you
are
the
last
he
said
with
a
touch
of
harshness
standing
up
with
his
hands
on
the
table
tell
the
reverend
mother
i
have
done
then
she
rose
too
ralph
she
cried
my
brother
for
jesu
sake
tell
the
reverend
mother
he
said
again
his
eyes
hard
with
decision
she
turned
and
went
out
without
a
word
ralph
found
the
interview
with
the
abbess
even
more
difficult
than
he
had
expected
once
her
face
twitched
with
tears
but
she
drove
them
back
bravely
and
faced
him
again
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
torridon
that
you
intend
to
take
your
sister
away
ralph
bowed
and
that
dame
martha
has
asked
to
be
released
again
he
bowed
are
you
not
afraid
sir
to
do
such
work
ralph
smiled
bitterly
i
am
not
reverend
mother
he
said
i
know
too
much
from
whom
oh
not
from
your
nuns
he
said
sharply
they
of
course
know
nothing
or
at
least
will
tell
me
nothing
it
was
from
dr
layton
and
what
did
layton
tell
you
i
can
hardly
tell
you
that
reverend
mother
it
is
not
fit
for
your
ears
she
looked
at
him
steadily
and
you
believe
it
ralph
smiled
that
makes
no
difference
he
said
i
am
acting
by
his
orders
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
then
may
our
lord
have
mercy
on
you
she
said
she
turned
to
where
the
gold
cope
gleamed
over
the
chair
with
the
mitre
and
censer
lying
on
its
folds
and
those
too
she
asked
those
too
said
ralph
she
turned
towards
the
door
without
a
word
there
are
the
fees
as
well
remarked
ralph
we
can
arrange
those
this
evening
reverend
mother
the
little
stiff
figure
turned
and
waited
at
the
door
and
at
what
time
will
you
dine
sir
immediately
said
ralph
he
was
served
at
dinner
with
the
same
courtesy
as
before
but
the
lay
sister
eyes
were
red
and
her
hands
shook
as
she
shifted
the
plates
neither
spoke
a
word
till
towards
the
end
of
the
meal
where
is
my
man
asked
ralph
who
had
not
seen
him
since
he
had
gone
out
with
the
abbess
a
couple
of
hours
before
the
sister
shook
her
head
where
is
the
reverend
mother
again
she
shook
her
head
ralph
enquired
the
hour
of
vespers
and
when
he
had
learnt
it
took
his
cap
and
went
out
to
look
for
morris
he
went
first
to
the
little
dark
outhouse
and
peered
in
over
the
bottom
half
of
the
door
but
there
was
no
sign
of
him
there
he
could
see
a
horse
standing
in
a
stall
opposite
and
tried
to
make
out
the
second
horse
that
he
knew
was
there
but
it
was
too
dark
and
he
turned
away
it
was
a
warm
october
afternoon
as
he
went
out
through
the
gatehouse
still
and
bright
with
the
mellow
smell
of
dying
leaves
in
the
air
the
fields
stretched
away
beyond
the
road
into
the
blue
distance
as
he
went
along
and
were
backed
by
the
thinning
woods
still
ruddy
with
the
last
flames
of
autumn
overhead
the
blue
sky
washed
with
recent
rains
arched
itself
in
a
great
transparent
vault
and
a
stream
of
birds
crossed
it
from
east
to
west
he
went
round
the
corner
of
the
convent
buildings
and
turned
up
into
a
meadow
beside
a
thick
privet
hedge
that
divided
it
from
the
garden
and
as
he
moved
along
he
heard
a
low
humming
noise
sounding
from
the
other
side
there
was
a
door
in
the
hedge
at
the
point
and
at
either
side
the
growth
was
a
little
thin
and
he
could
look
through
without
being
himself
seen
the
grass
was
trim
and
smooth
inside
there
was
a
mass
of
autumn
flowers
grown
no
doubt
for
the
altar
running
in
a
broad
bed
across
the
nearer
side
of
the
garden
and
beyond
it
rose
a
grey
dial
round
which
sat
a
circle
of
nuns
ralph
pressed
his
face
to
the
hedge
and
watched
there
they
were
each
with
her
wheel
before
her
spinning
in
silence
the
abbess
sat
in
the
centre
immediately
below
the
dial
with
a
book
in
her
hand
and
was
turning
the
pages
he
could
see
a
nun
face
steadily
bent
on
her
wheel
that
was
dame
agnes
who
had
fetched
the
cope
for
him
in
the
morning
she
seemed
perfectly
quiet
and
unaffected
watching
her
thread
and
putting
out
a
deft
hand
now
and
again
to
the
machinery
beside
her
sat
another
whose
face
he
remembered
well
she
had
stammered
a
little
as
she
gave
her
answers
in
the
morning
and
even
as
he
looked
the
face
twitched
suddenly
and
broke
into
tears
he
saw
the
abbess
turn
from
her
book
and
lay
her
hand
with
a
kind
of
tender
decision
on
the
nun
arm
and
saw
her
lips
move
but
the
hum
and
rattle
of
the
was
too
loud
to
let
him
hear
what
she
said
he
saw
now
the
other
nun
lift
her
face
again
from
her
hands
and
wink
away
her
tears
as
she
laid
hold
of
the
thread
once
more
ralph
had
a
strange
struggle
with
himself
that
afternoon
as
he
walked
on
in
the
pleasant
autumn
weather
through
meadow
and
copse
the
sight
of
the
patient
women
had
touched
him
profoundly
surely
it
was
almost
too
much
to
ask
him
to
turn
away
his
own
sister
from
the
place
she
loved
if
he
relented
it
was
certain
that
no
other
visitor
would
come
that
way
for
the
present
she
might
at
least
have
another
year
or
two
of
peace
was
it
too
late
he
reminded
himself
again
how
such
things
were
bound
to
happen
how
every
change
however
beneficial
must
bring
sorrow
with
it
and
that
to
turn
back
on
such
work
because
a
few
women
suffered
was
not
worthy
of
a
man
it
was
long
before
he
could
come
to
any
decision
and
the
evening
was
drawing
on
and
the
time
for
vespers
come
and
gone
before
he
turned
at
last
into
the
village
to
enquire
for
his
servant
the
other
men
had
seen
nothing
of
morris
that
day
he
had
not
been
back
to
the
village
a
group
or
two
stared
awefully
at
the
fine
gentleman
with
the
strong
face
and
steady
intolerant
eyes
as
he
strode
down
the
tiny
street
in
his
rich
dress
swinging
his
long
cane
they
had
learnt
who
he
was
now
but
were
so
overcome
by
seeing
the
king
commissioner
that
they
forgot
to
salute
him
as
he
turned
the
corner
again
he
looked
round
once
more
and
there
they
were
still
watching
him
a
few
women
had
come
to
the
doors
as
well
and
dropped
their
arched
hands
hastily
and
disappeared
as
he
turned
the
convent
seemed
all
as
he
had
left
it
earlier
in
the
afternoon
as
he
came
in
sight
of
it
again
the
high
chapel
roof
rose
clear
against
the
reddening
sky
with
the
bell
framed
in
its
turret
distinct
as
if
carved
out
of
cardboard
against
the
splendour
he
was
admitted
instantly
when
he
rang
on
the
bell
but
the
portress
seemed
to
look
at
him
with
a
strange
air
of
expectancy
and
stood
looking
after
him
as
he
went
across
the
paved
court
to
the
door
of
the
there
was
a
murmur
of
voices
in
the
parlour
as
he
paused
in
the
entry
and
he
wondered
who
was
within
but
as
his
foot
rang
out
the
sound
ceased
he
opened
the
door
and
went
in
and
then
stopped
bewildered
in
the
dim
light
that
passed
through
the
window
stood
his
father
and
mary
maxwell
his
sister
chapter
v
father
and
son
none
of
the
three
spoke
for
a
moment
then
mary
drew
her
breath
sharply
as
she
saw
ralph
face
for
it
had
hardened
during
that
moment
into
a
kind
of
blind
obstinacy
which
she
had
only
seen
once
or
twice
in
her
life
before
as
he
stood
there
he
seemed
to
stiffen
into
resistance
his
eyelids
drooped
and
little
lines
showed
themselves
suddenly
at
either
side
of
his
thin
mouth
his
father
saw
it
too
for
the
hand
that
he
had
lifted
entreatingly
sank
again
and
his
voice
was
tremulous
as
he
spoke
ralph
ralph
my
son
he
said
still
the
man
said
nothing
but
stood
frozen
his
face
to
the
windows
ralph
my
son
said
the
other
again
you
know
why
we
have
come
you
have
come
to
hinder
my
business
his
voice
was
thin
and
metallic
as
rigid
as
steel
we
have
come
to
hinder
a
great
sin
against
god
said
sir
james
ralph
opened
his
eyes
wide
with
a
sort
of
fury
and
thrust
his
chin
out
she
should
pack
a
thousand
times
more
now
than
before
he
said
the
father
face
too
deepened
into
strength
now
and
he
drew
himself
up
do
you
know
what
you
are
doing
he
said
i
do
sir
there
was
an
extraordinary
insolence
in
his
voice
and
mary
took
a
step
forward
oh
ralph
she
said
at
least
do
it
like
a
gentleman
ralph
turned
on
her
sharply
and
the
obstinacy
vanished
in
anger
i
will
not
be
pushed
like
this
he
snarled
what
right
is
it
of
yours
to
come
between
me
and
my
work
sir
james
made
a
quick
imperious
gesture
and
his
air
of
entreaty
fell
from
him
like
a
cloak
sit
down
sir
he
said
and
his
voice
rang
strongly
we
have
a
right
in
margaret
affairs
we
will
say
what
we
wish
mary
glanced
at
him
she
had
never
seen
her
father
like
this
before
as
he
stood
in
three
quarter
profile
rigid
with
decision
when
she
looked
at
ralph
again
his
face
had
tightened
once
more
into
obstinacy
he
answered
sir
james
with
a
kind
of
silky
deference
of
course
i
will
sit
down
sir
and
you
shall
say
what
you
will
he
went
across
the
room
and
drew
out
a
couple
of
chairs
before
the
cold
hearth
where
the
white
ashes
and
logs
of
last
night
fire
still
rested
sir
james
sat
down
with
his
back
to
the
window
so
that
mary
could
not
see
his
face
and
ralph
stood
by
the
other
chair
a
moment
facing
her
sit
down
mary
he
said
wait
i
will
have
candles
he
stepped
back
to
the
door
and
called
to
the
portress
and
then
returned
and
seated
himself
deliberately
setting
his
cane
in
the
corner
beside
him
none
of
the
three
spoke
again
until
the
nun
had
come
in
with
a
couple
of
candles
that
she
set
in
the
stands
and
lighted
then
she
went
out
without
glancing
at
anyone
mary
was
sitting
in
the
window
seat
so
the
curtains
remained
undrawn
and
there
was
a
mystical
compound
of
twilight
and
in
the
room
she
had
a
flash
of
metaphor
and
saw
in
it
the
meeting
of
the
old
and
new
religions
the
type
of
these
two
men
of
whom
the
light
of
one
was
fading
and
the
other
waxing
the
candlelight
fell
full
on
ralph
face
that
stood
out
against
the
whitewashed
wall
behind
then
she
listened
and
watched
with
an
intent
interest
it
is
this
said
sir
james
we
heard
you
were
here
ralph
smiled
with
one
side
of
his
mouth
so
that
his
father
could
see
it
i
do
not
wish
to
do
anything
i
should
not
went
on
the
old
man
or
to
meddle
in
his
grace
matters
and
you
wish
me
not
to
meddle
either
sir
put
in
ralph
yes
said
his
father
i
am
very
willing
to
receive
you
and
your
wife
at
home
to
make
any
suitable
provision
to
give
you
half
the
house
if
you
wish
for
it
if
you
will
only
give
up
this
accursed
work
he
was
speaking
with
a
tranquil
deliberation
all
the
emotion
and
passion
seemed
to
have
left
his
voice
but
mary
from
behind
could
see
his
right
hand
clenched
like
a
vice
upon
the
knob
of
his
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
the
two
men
had
suddenly
frozen
into
their
air
was
one
of
two
acquaintances
talking
not
of
father
and
son
and
if
not
sir
asked
ralph
with
the
same
courtesy
wait
said
his
father
and
he
lifted
his
hand
a
moment
and
dropped
it
again
he
was
speaking
in
short
sharp
sentences
i
know
that
you
have
great
things
before
you
and
that
i
am
asking
much
from
you
i
do
not
wish
you
to
think
that
i
am
ignorant
of
that
if
nothing
else
will
do
i
am
willing
to
give
up
the
house
altogether
to
you
and
your
wife
i
do
not
know
about
your
mother
mary
drew
her
breath
hard
the
words
were
like
an
explosion
in
her
soul
and
opened
up
unsuspected
gulfs
things
must
be
desperate
if
her
father
could
speak
like
that
he
had
not
hinted
a
word
of
this
during
that
silent
strenuous
ride
they
had
had
together
when
he
had
called
for
her
suddenly
at
great
keynes
earlier
in
the
afternoon
she
saw
ralph
give
a
quick
stare
at
his
father
and
drop
his
eyes
again
you
are
very
generous
sir
he
said
almost
immediately
but
i
do
not
ask
for
a
bribe
you
you
are
unlike
your
master
in
that
then
said
sir
james
by
an
irresistible
impulse
ralph
face
stiffened
yet
more
then
that
is
all
sir
he
asked
i
beg
your
pardon
for
saying
that
added
his
father
courteously
it
should
not
have
been
said
it
is
not
a
bribe
however
it
is
an
offer
to
compensate
for
any
loss
you
may
incur
have
you
finished
sir
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
on
that
point
said
sir
james
except
well
sir
except
that
i
do
not
know
how
mistress
atherton
will
take
this
story
ralph
face
grew
a
shade
paler
yet
but
his
lips
snapped
together
though
his
eyes
flinched
that
is
a
threat
sir
that
is
as
you
please
a
little
pulse
beat
sharply
in
ralph
cheek
he
was
looking
with
a
kind
of
steady
fury
at
his
father
but
mary
thought
she
saw
indecision
too
in
his
which
were
quivering
almost
imperceptibly
you
have
offered
me
a
bribe
and
a
threat
sir
two
insults
have
you
a
third
ready
mary
heard
a
breath
from
her
father
but
he
spoke
quietly
i
have
no
more
to
say
on
that
point
he
said
then
i
must
refuse
said
ralph
instantly
i
see
no
reason
to
give
up
my
work
i
have
very
hearty
sympathy
with
it
the
old
man
hand
twitched
uncontrollably
on
his
for
a
moment
he
half
lifted
his
hand
but
he
dropped
it
again
then
as
to
margaret
he
went
on
in
a
moment
i
understand
you
had
intended
to
dismiss
her
from
the
convent
ralph
bowed
and
where
do
you
suggest
that
she
should
go
she
must
go
home
said
ralph
to
overfield
ralph
assented
then
i
will
not
receive
her
said
sir
james
mary
started
up
nor
will
mary
receive
her
he
added
half
turning
towards
her
mary
maxwell
sat
back
at
once
she
thought
she
understood
what
he
meant
now
ralph
stared
at
his
father
a
moment
before
he
too
understood
then
he
saw
the
point
and
riposted
deftly
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
ostentatiously
as
if
to
shake
off
responsibility
well
then
that
is
not
my
business
i
shall
give
her
a
gown
and
five
shillings
with
the
other
one
the
extraordinary
brutality
of
the
words
struck
mary
like
a
whip
but
sir
james
met
it
that
is
for
you
to
settle
then
he
said
only
you
need
not
send
her
to
overfield
or
great
keynes
for
she
will
be
sent
back
here
at
once
ralph
smiled
with
an
air
of
tolerant
incredulity
sir
james
rose
briskly
come
mary
he
said
and
turned
his
back
abruptly
on
ralph
we
must
find
lodgings
for
the
good
nuns
will
not
have
room
as
mary
looked
at
his
face
in
the
candlelight
she
was
astonished
by
its
decision
there
was
not
the
smallest
hint
of
yielding
it
was
very
pale
but
absolutely
determined
and
for
the
last
time
in
her
life
she
noticed
how
like
it
was
to
ralph
the
line
of
the
lips
was
identical
and
his
eyelids
drooped
now
like
his
son
ralph
too
rose
and
then
on
a
sudden
she
saw
the
resolute
obstinacy
fade
from
his
eyes
and
mouth
it
was
as
if
the
spirit
of
one
man
had
passed
into
the
other
father
he
said
she
expected
a
rush
of
emotion
into
the
old
man
face
but
there
was
not
a
ripple
he
paused
a
moment
but
ralph
was
silent
i
have
no
more
to
say
to
you
sir
and
i
beg
that
you
will
not
come
home
again
as
they
passed
out
into
the
entrance
passage
she
turned
again
and
saw
ralph
dazed
and
trembling
at
the
table
then
they
were
out
in
the
road
through
the
open
gate
and
a
long
moan
broke
from
her
father
oh
god
forgive
me
he
said
have
i
failed
chapter
vi
a
nun
defiance
it
was
a
very
strange
evening
that
mary
and
her
father
passed
in
the
little
upstairs
room
looking
on
to
the
street
at
rusper
sir
james
had
hardly
spoken
and
after
supper
had
sat
near
the
window
with
a
curious
alertness
in
his
face
mary
knew
that
chris
was
expected
and
that
morris
had
ridden
on
to
fetch
him
after
he
had
called
at
overfield
but
from
her
short
interview
with
margaret
she
had
seen
that
his
presence
would
not
be
required
the
young
nun
though
bewildered
and
stunned
by
the
news
that
she
must
go
had
not
wavered
for
a
moment
as
regards
her
intention
to
follow
out
her
religious
vocation
in
some
manner
and
it
was
to
confirm
her
in
it
in
case
she
hesitated
that
sir
james
had
sent
on
the
servant
to
fetch
chris
it
was
all
like
a
dreadful
dream
to
mary
she
had
gone
out
from
dinner
at
her
own
house
into
the
pleasant
october
sunshine
with
her
cheerful
husband
beside
her
when
her
father
had
come
out
through
the
house
with
his
in
his
hand
and
in
a
few
seconds
she
had
found
herself
plunged
into
new
and
passionate
relations
first
with
him
for
she
had
never
seen
him
so
stirred
and
then
with
her
brothers
and
sister
ralph
that
dignified
man
of
affairs
suddenly
stepped
into
her
mind
as
a
formidable
enemy
of
god
and
man
chris
appeared
as
a
spiritual
power
and
the
quiet
margaret
as
the
very
centre
of
the
sudden
storm
she
sat
here
now
by
the
fire
shading
her
face
with
her
hand
and
watching
that
familiar
face
set
in
hard
and
undreamed
lines
of
passion
and
resolution
and
expectancy
once
as
footsteps
came
up
the
street
he
had
started
up
and
sat
down
trembling
she
waited
till
the
steps
went
past
and
then
spoke
chris
will
be
riding
father
he
nodded
abruptly
and
she
saw
by
his
manner
that
it
was
not
chris
he
was
expecting
she
understood
then
that
he
still
had
hopes
of
his
other
son
but
they
sat
on
into
the
night
in
the
deep
stillness
till
the
fire
burned
low
and
red
and
the
stars
she
had
seen
at
the
horizon
wheeled
up
and
out
of
sight
above
the
then
he
suddenly
turned
to
her
you
must
go
to
bed
mary
he
said
i
will
wait
for
chris
she
lay
long
awake
in
the
tiny
that
the
labourer
and
his
wife
had
given
up
to
her
hearing
the
horses
stamp
in
the
cold
shed
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
the
faces
moved
and
turned
like
the
colours
of
a
kaleidoscope
now
her
father
eyes
and
mouth
hung
like
a
mask
before
her
with
that
terrible
look
that
had
been
on
them
as
he
faced
ralph
at
the
end
now
ralph
own
face
defiant
icy
melting
in
turns
now
margaret
with
wide
terrified
eyes
as
she
had
seen
it
in
the
parlour
that
afternoon
now
her
own
husband
and
the
sweet
autumn
woods
and
meadows
lay
before
her
as
she
had
seen
them
during
that
silent
ride
the
convent
the
village
her
own
home
with
its
square
windows
and
yew
hedge
a
hundred
images
there
was
a
talking
when
she
awoke
for
the
last
time
and
through
the
crazy
door
glimmered
a
crack
of
grey
dawn
and
as
she
listened
she
knew
that
chris
was
come
it
was
a
strange
meeting
when
she
came
out
a
few
minutes
later
there
was
the
monk
unshaven
and
pale
under
the
eyes
with
his
thinned
face
that
gave
no
smile
as
she
came
in
her
father
desperately
white
and
resolved
morris
spruce
and
grave
as
usual
sitting
with
his
hat
between
his
knees
behind
the
others
he
rose
deferentially
as
she
came
in
and
remained
standing
her
father
began
abruptly
as
she
appeared
he
can
do
nothing
he
said
he
can
but
turn
her
on
to
the
road
and
i
do
not
think
he
will
dare
ah
beatrice
atherton
questioned
mary
who
had
a
clearer
view
of
the
situation
now
yes
beatrice
atherton
he
fears
that
we
shall
tell
her
he
can
not
send
margaret
to
overfield
or
great
keynes
now
and
if
he
turns
her
out
after
all
sir
james
looked
at
her
keenly
we
must
leave
the
rest
to
god
he
said
the
village
was
well
awake
by
the
time
that
they
had
finished
their
talk
and
had
had
something
to
eat
the
drama
at
the
convent
had
leaked
out
through
the
boy
who
served
the
altar
there
and
a
little
group
was
assembled
opposite
the
windows
of
the
cottage
to
which
the
monk
had
been
seen
to
ride
up
an
hour
or
two
before
it
seemed
strange
that
no
priest
had
been
near
them
but
it
was
fairly
evident
that
the
terror
was
too
great
as
the
four
came
out
on
to
the
road
a
clerical
cap
peeped
for
a
moment
from
the
churchyard
wall
and
disappeared
again
they
went
down
towards
the
convent
along
the
grey
road
in
the
pale
autumn
morning
air
mary
still
seemed
to
herself
to
walk
in
a
dream
with
her
father
and
brother
on
either
side
masquerading
in
strange
character
the
familiar
atmosphere
had
been
swept
from
them
the
background
of
association
was
gone
and
they
moved
now
in
a
new
scene
with
new
parts
to
play
that
were
bringing
out
powers
which
she
had
never
suspected
in
them
it
seemed
as
if
their
essential
souls
had
been
laid
bare
by
a
catastrophe
and
that
she
had
never
known
them
before
for
herself
she
felt
helpless
and
dazed
her
own
independence
seemed
gone
and
she
was
aware
that
her
soul
was
leaning
on
those
of
the
two
who
walked
beside
her
and
who
were
masculine
and
capable
beyond
all
her
previous
knowledge
of
them
behind
she
heard
a
murmur
of
voices
and
footsteps
of
three
or
four
villagers
who
followed
to
see
what
would
happen
she
had
no
idea
of
what
her
father
meant
to
do
it
was
incredible
that
he
should
leave
margaret
in
the
road
with
her
gown
and
five
shillings
but
it
was
yet
more
incredible
that
all
his
threats
should
be
idle
only
one
thing
emerged
clearly
that
he
had
thrown
a
heavier
responsibility
upon
ralph
than
the
latter
had
foreseen
perhaps
the
rest
must
indeed
be
left
to
god
she
did
not
even
know
what
he
meant
to
do
now
whether
to
make
one
last
effort
with
ralph
or
to
leave
him
to
himself
and
she
had
not
dared
to
ask
they
passed
straight
down
together
in
silence
to
the
and
were
admitted
immediately
by
the
portress
whose
face
was
convulsed
and
swollen
they
are
to
go
she
sobbed
sir
james
made
a
gesture
and
passed
in
to
the
tiny
lodge
on
the
left
where
the
portress
usually
sat
chris
and
mary
followed
him
in
and
morris
went
across
to
the
the
bell
sounded
out
overhead
for
mass
as
they
sat
there
in
the
dim
morning
light
twenty
or
thirty
strokes
and
ceased
but
there
was
no
movement
from
the
little
door
of
the
across
the
court
the
portress
had
disappeared
through
the
second
door
that
led
from
the
tiny
room
in
which
they
sat
into
the
precincts
of
the
convent
itself
mary
looked
distractedly
round
her
at
the
little
hatch
that
gave
on
to
the
entrance
gate
and
the
chain
hanging
by
it
that
communicated
with
one
of
the
bolts
at
the
little
crucifix
that
hung
beside
it
the
devotional
book
that
lay
on
the
shelf
the
door
into
the
convent
with
the
title
inscribed
above
it
she
glanced
at
her
father
and
brother
sir
james
was
sitting
with
his
grey
head
in
his
hands
motionless
and
soundless
chris
was
standing
upright
and
rigid
staring
steadily
out
through
the
window
into
the
court
then
through
the
window
she
too
saw
morris
come
out
from
the
and
pass
along
to
the
stable
again
there
was
silence
the
minutes
went
by
and
the
saunce
bell
sounded
three
strokes
from
the
turret
chris
sank
on
to
his
knees
and
a
moment
later
mary
and
her
father
followed
his
example
and
so
the
three
remained
in
the
dark
silent
lodge
with
no
sound
but
their
breathing
and
once
a
sharp
whispered
word
of
prayer
from
the
old
man
as
the
sacring
bell
sounded
there
was
a
sudden
noise
in
the
court
and
mary
lifted
her
head
from
where
she
knelt
she
could
see
the
two
doors
across
the
court
those
of
the
and
the
stable
beyond
and
simultaneously
out
of
the
one
came
ralph
gloved
and
booted
with
his
cap
on
his
head
and
morris
leading
his
horse
out
of
the
other
the
servant
lifted
his
cap
at
the
sound
of
the
bell
and
dropped
on
to
his
knees
still
holding
the
bridle
his
master
stood
as
he
was
and
looked
at
him
mary
could
only
see
the
latter
profile
but
even
that
was
scornful
and
hard
again
the
bell
sounded
the
mystery
was
done
and
the
servant
stood
up
as
her
father
and
chris
rose
mary
rose
with
them
and
the
three
remained
in
complete
silence
watching
the
little
scene
in
the
court
ralph
made
a
sign
and
the
servant
attached
the
bridle
of
the
horse
to
a
ring
beside
the
and
went
past
his
master
into
the
with
a
deferential
stoop
of
the
shoulders
ralph
stood
a
moment
longer
and
then
followed
him
in
then
again
the
minutes
went
by
there
was
a
sound
of
on
the
road
presently
and
of
talking
that
grew
louder
the
hoofs
ceased
there
was
a
sharp
peal
on
the
bell
and
the
talking
began
again
chris
glanced
across
at
his
father
but
the
old
man
shook
his
head
and
the
three
remained
as
they
were
watching
and
listening
as
the
bell
rang
out
again
impatiently
the
door
behind
opened
and
the
portress
came
swiftly
through
followed
by
the
abbess
come
quickly
the
old
lady
whispered
sister
susan
is
going
to
let
them
in
she
stood
aside
and
made
a
motion
to
them
to
come
through
and
a
moment
late
the
four
were
in
the
convent
and
the
door
was
shut
behind
them
they
are
torridon
men
whispered
the
abbess
her
eyes
round
with
excitement
they
are
come
to
pack
the
things
she
led
them
on
through
the
narrow
passage
up
a
stone
flight
of
stairs
to
the
corridor
that
ran
over
the
little
cloister
and
pushed
open
the
door
of
a
cell
wait
here
she
said
you
can
do
no
more
i
will
go
down
to
them
you
are
in
the
enclosure
but
i
can
not
help
it
and
she
had
whisked
out
again
with
an
air
of
extraordinary
composure
shutting
the
door
behind
her
the
three
went
across
to
the
window
still
speaking
no
word
and
looked
down
the
tiny
court
seemed
half
full
of
people
now
there
were
three
horses
there
besides
ralph
own
marked
by
its
rich
saddle
and
still
attached
to
the
ring
by
the
stable
door
and
a
couple
of
men
were
busy
loading
one
of
them
with
bundles
from
one
of
these
which
was
badly
packed
a
shimmering
corner
of
gold
cloth
projected
ralph
was
standing
by
the
door
of
the
watching
and
making
a
sign
now
and
again
with
his
whip
they
could
not
see
his
face
as
he
stood
so
directly
below
them
only
his
rich
cap
and
feather
and
his
strong
figure
beneath
morris
was
waiting
now
by
his
master
horse
the
portress
was
by
her
door
as
they
looked
the
little
black
and
white
figure
of
the
abbess
came
out
beneath
them
and
stood
by
the
portress
the
packing
went
on
in
silence
it
was
terrible
to
mary
to
stand
there
and
watch
the
tragedy
the
wrecking
and
robbing
of
this
peaceful
house
and
yet
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
she
knew
that
the
issues
were
in
stronger
hands
than
hers
she
glanced
piteously
at
her
father
and
brother
on
either
side
but
their
faces
were
set
and
white
and
they
did
not
turn
at
her
movement
there
was
the
sound
of
an
opening
door
and
two
women
came
out
from
the
convent
at
one
side
and
stood
waiting
one
was
in
secular
dress
the
other
was
still
in
her
habit
but
carried
a
long
dark
mantle
across
her
arm
and
mary
caught
her
breath
and
bit
her
lip
fiercely
as
she
recognised
the
second
to
be
her
sister
she
felt
she
must
cry
out
and
denounce
the
sacrilege
and
made
an
instinctive
movement
nearer
the
window
but
in
a
moment
her
hand
was
on
her
arm
be
still
mary
it
is
all
well
one
of
the
horses
was
being
led
away
by
now
through
the
open
door
and
the
two
others
followed
almost
immediately
but
the
principal
actors
were
still
in
their
places
the
abbess
and
the
portress
together
on
this
side
ralph
on
that
and
the
two
other
women
a
little
apart
from
one
another
at
the
further
end
of
the
court
then
ralph
beckoned
abruptly
with
his
whip
and
mary
saw
her
sister
move
out
towards
the
gate
she
caught
a
glance
of
her
face
and
saw
that
her
lips
were
white
and
trembling
and
her
eyes
full
of
agony
the
other
woman
followed
briskly
and
the
two
disappeared
through
to
the
road
outside
again
ralph
beckoned
and
morris
brought
up
the
horse
that
he
had
now
detached
from
the
ring
and
stood
by
its
head
holding
the
for
his
master
to
mount
ralph
gathered
the
reins
into
his
left
hand
and
for
a
moment
they
saw
his
face
across
the
back
of
the
horse
fierce
and
white
then
he
was
up
and
settling
his
right
foot
into
the
stirrup
morris
let
go
and
stood
back
and
simultaneously
ralph
struck
him
with
his
across
the
face
a
furious
slash
mary
cried
out
uncontrollably
and
shrank
back
and
a
moment
later
her
father
was
leaning
from
the
window
and
she
beside
him
you
damned
coward
he
shouted
morris
you
are
my
servant
now
ralph
did
not
turn
his
head
an
inch
and
a
moment
later
disappeared
on
through
the
gate
and
the
portress
had
closed
it
behind
him
the
little
court
was
silent
now
and
empty
except
for
the
motionless
figure
behind
with
morris
beside
her
and
the
lay
sister
by
the
gate
her
hand
still
on
the
key
that
she
had
turned
and
her
eyes
intent
and
expectant
fixed
on
her
superior
morris
lifted
a
handkerchief
now
and
again
gently
to
his
face
and
mary
as
she
leaned
half
sobbing
from
above
saw
that
there
were
spots
of
crimson
on
the
white
oh
morris
she
whispered
the
servant
looked
up
with
a
great
weal
across
one
cheek
and
bowed
a
little
but
he
could
not
speak
yet
outside
they
could
hear
the
jingle
of
and
then
a
voice
begin
but
they
could
not
distinguish
the
words
it
was
ralph
speaking
but
they
could
only
guess
what
it
was
that
he
was
saying
overhead
the
autumn
sky
was
a
vault
of
pale
blue
and
a
bird
or
two
chirped
briskly
from
the
roof
opposite
the
voice
outside
grew
louder
and
ceased
and
the
noise
of
horse
hoofs
broke
out
still
there
was
no
movement
from
any
within
the
abbess
was
standing
now
with
one
hand
uplifted
as
if
for
silence
and
mary
heard
the
hoofs
sound
fainter
up
the
road
they
grew
louder
again
as
they
reached
higher
ground
and
then
ceased
altogether
the
old
man
touched
mary
on
the
arm
and
the
three
went
out
along
the
little
corridor
and
down
the
stone
stairs
as
they
passed
through
the
lodge
and
came
into
the
court
mary
saw
that
the
abbess
had
moved
from
her
place
and
was
standing
with
the
portress
close
by
the
gate
her
face
was
towards
them
a
little
on
one
side
and
she
seemed
to
be
listening
intently
her
ear
against
the
door
her
lower
lip
sucked
in
and
her
eyes
bright
and
vacant
she
still
held
one
hand
up
for
silence
then
there
came
a
tiny
tapping
on
the
and
she
instantly
turned
and
snatched
at
the
key
and
a
moment
later
the
door
was
wide
come
in
my
poor
child
she
said
chapter
vii
st
pancras
priory
it
was
a
little
more
than
a
month
later
that
ralph
met
his
at
lewes
priory
he
had
left
rusper
in
a
storm
of
angry
obstinacy
compelled
by
sheer
pride
to
do
what
he
had
not
intended
the
arrival
of
his
father
and
mary
there
had
had
exactly
the
opposite
effect
to
that
which
they
hoped
and
ralph
had
turned
margaret
out
of
the
convent
simply
because
he
could
not
bear
that
they
should
think
that
he
could
be
frightened
from
his
purpose
as
he
had
ridden
off
on
that
october
morning
leaving
margaret
standing
outside
with
her
cloak
over
her
arm
he
had
had
a
very
sharp
suspicion
that
she
would
be
received
back
again
but
he
had
not
felt
himself
strong
enough
to
take
any
further
steps
so
he
contented
himself
with
sending
in
his
report
to
layton
knowing
well
that
heavy
punishment
would
fall
on
the
convent
if
it
was
discovered
that
the
abbess
had
disobeyed
the
visitors
injunctions
then
for
a
month
or
so
he
had
ridden
about
the
county
carrying
off
spoils
appointing
new
officials
and
doing
the
other
duties
assigned
to
him
he
was
offered
bribes
again
and
again
by
superiors
of
religious
houses
but
unlike
his
always
refused
them
and
fell
the
more
hardly
on
those
that
offered
them
he
turned
out
numbers
of
young
religious
and
released
elder
ones
who
desired
it
and
by
the
time
that
he
reached
lewes
was
fairly
practised
in
the
duties
of
his
position
but
the
thought
of
the
consequences
of
his
action
with
regard
to
his
future
seldom
left
him
he
had
alienated
his
family
and
perhaps
beatrice
as
he
rode
once
through
cuckfield
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
woods
above
overfield
glorious
in
their
autumn
livery
he
wondered
whether
he
would
ever
find
himself
at
home
there
again
it
was
a
good
deal
to
give
up
but
he
comforted
himself
with
the
thought
of
his
own
career
and
with
the
pleasant
prospect
of
possessing
some
such
house
in
his
own
right
when
the
work
that
he
now
understood
had
been
accomplished
and
the
monastic
buildings
were
empty
of
occupants
he
had
received
one
letter
to
his
surprise
from
his
mother
that
was
brought
to
him
by
a
messenger
in
one
of
the
houses
where
he
stayed
it
informed
him
that
he
had
the
writer
approval
and
that
she
was
thankful
to
have
one
son
at
least
who
was
a
man
and
described
further
how
his
father
and
mary
had
come
back
and
without
margaret
and
that
she
supposed
that
the
abbess
of
rusper
had
taken
her
back
go
on
my
son
she
ended
it
will
be
all
well
you
can
not
come
home
i
know
while
your
father
is
in
his
present
mind
but
it
is
a
dull
place
and
you
lose
nothing
when
you
are
married
it
will
be
different
carleton
is
very
tiresome
but
it
does
not
matter
ralph
smiled
to
himself
as
he
thought
of
the
life
that
must
now
be
proceeding
at
his
home
he
had
written
once
to
beatrice
in
a
rather
tentative
tone
assuring
her
that
he
was
doing
his
best
to
be
just
and
merciful
and
professing
to
take
it
for
granted
that
she
knew
how
to
discount
any
exaggerated
stories
of
the
visitors
doings
that
might
come
to
her
ears
but
he
had
received
no
answer
and
indeed
had
told
her
that
he
did
not
expect
one
for
he
was
continually
on
the
move
and
could
give
no
fixed
address
as
he
came
up
over
the
downs
above
lewes
he
was
conscious
of
a
keen
excitement
this
would
be
the
biggest
work
he
had
undertaken
and
it
had
the
additional
zest
of
being
a
means
of
annoying
his
brother
who
had
provoked
him
so
often
since
his
quarrel
with
chris
in
his
own
rooms
in
the
summer
he
had
retained
an
angry
contempt
towards
him
chris
had
been
insolent
and
theatrical
he
told
himself
and
had
thrown
off
all
claims
to
tenderness
and
ralph
feelings
towards
him
were
not
improved
by
the
information
given
him
by
one
of
his
men
that
his
brother
had
been
present
at
the
scene
at
rusper
no
doubt
summoned
there
by
morris
who
had
proved
such
a
desperate
traitor
to
his
master
by
slipping
off
to
overfield
on
the
morning
of
the
sunday
ralph
was
very
much
puzzled
at
first
by
morris
behaviour
the
man
had
always
been
respectful
and
obedient
but
it
was
now
evident
to
him
that
he
had
been
all
along
and
still
retained
a
superstitious
reverence
for
ecclesiastical
things
and
persons
and
although
it
was
very
inconvenient
and
tiresome
to
lose
him
yet
it
was
better
to
be
inadequately
than
treacherously
served
lewes
priory
was
a
magnificent
sight
as
ralph
came
up
on
to
the
top
of
the
last
shoulder
below
mount
harry
the
town
lay
below
him
in
the
deep
hollow
piled
house
above
house
along
the
sides
beyond
it
in
the
evening
light
against
the
rich
autumn
fields
and
the
gleam
of
water
towered
up
the
tall
church
with
the
monastic
buildings
nestling
behind
the
thought
crossed
his
mind
that
it
would
do
very
well
for
himself
the
town
was
conveniently
placed
between
london
and
the
sea
within
a
day
ride
from
either
there
would
be
shops
and
company
there
and
the
priory
itself
would
be
a
dignified
and
suitable
house
when
it
had
been
properly
the
only
drawback
would
be
scrupulousness
but
he
had
little
doubt
that
ultimately
that
could
be
overcome
it
would
be
ridiculous
for
a
single
girl
to
set
herself
up
against
the
conviction
of
a
country
and
refuse
to
avail
herself
of
the
advantages
of
a
reform
that
was
so
sorely
needed
she
trusted
him
already
and
it
would
not
need
much
persuasion
he
thought
to
convince
her
mind
as
well
as
her
heart
of
course
lewes
priory
would
be
a
great
prize
and
there
would
be
many
applicants
for
it
and
he
realized
that
more
than
ever
as
he
came
up
to
its
splendid
gateway
and
saw
the
high
tower
overhead
and
the
long
tiled
roofs
to
the
right
but
his
own
relations
with
cromwell
were
of
the
best
and
he
decided
that
at
least
no
harm
could
result
from
asking
it
was
with
considerable
excitement
that
he
dismounted
in
the
court
and
saw
the
throng
of
layton
men
going
to
and
fro
as
at
durford
so
here
his
superior
had
arrived
before
him
and
the
place
was
already
astir
the
had
been
bestowed
in
the
stables
and
the
were
being
now
unloaded
before
the
door
of
the
there
were
servants
going
to
and
fro
in
livery
with
an
monk
or
two
here
and
there
among
them
and
a
buzz
and
clatter
rose
on
all
sides
one
of
layton
secretaries
who
had
been
at
durford
recognised
ralph
and
came
up
immediately
saluting
him
deferentially
the
doctor
is
with
the
sir
he
said
he
gave
orders
that
you
were
to
be
brought
to
him
as
soon
as
you
arrived
mr
torridon
ralph
followed
him
into
the
and
up
the
stairs
up
which
chris
had
come
at
his
first
arrival
and
was
shown
into
the
parlour
there
was
a
sound
of
voices
as
they
approached
the
door
and
as
ralph
entered
he
saw
at
once
that
layton
was
busy
at
his
work
come
in
sir
he
cried
cheerfully
from
behind
the
table
at
which
he
sat
here
is
desperate
work
for
you
and
me
no
less
than
rank
treason
mr
torridon
a
monk
was
standing
before
the
table
who
turned
nervously
as
ralph
came
in
he
was
a
man
and
like
a
foreigner
but
his
eyes
were
full
of
terror
now
and
his
lips
trembling
piteously
ralph
greeted
layton
shortly
and
sat
down
beside
him
now
sir
went
on
the
other
your
only
hope
is
to
submit
yourself
to
the
king
clemency
you
have
confessed
yourself
to
treason
in
your
preaching
and
even
if
you
did
not
it
would
not
signify
for
i
have
the
accusation
from
the
young
man
at
farley
in
my
bag
you
tell
me
you
did
not
know
it
was
treason
but
are
you
ready
sir
to
tell
the
grace
that
the
monk
eyes
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
anxiously
ralph
could
see
that
he
was
desperately
afraid
tell
me
that
sir
cried
the
doctor
again
rapping
the
table
with
his
open
hand
i
i
what
shall
i
do
sir
stammered
the
monk
you
must
throw
yourself
on
the
king
mercy
reverend
father
and
as
a
beginning
you
must
throw
yourself
on
mine
and
torridon
here
now
listen
to
this
layton
lifted
one
of
the
papers
that
lay
before
him
and
read
it
aloud
looking
severely
at
the
monk
over
the
top
of
it
between
the
sentences
it
was
in
the
form
of
a
confession
and
declared
that
on
such
a
date
in
the
priory
church
of
st
pancras
at
lewes
the
undersigned
had
preached
treason
although
ignorant
that
it
was
so
in
the
presence
of
the
prior
and
community
and
that
the
prior
although
he
knew
what
was
to
be
said
and
had
heard
the
sermon
in
question
had
neither
forbidden
it
beforehand
nor
denounced
it
afterwards
and
that
the
undersigned
entreated
the
king
clemency
for
the
fault
and
submitted
himself
entirely
to
his
grace
judgment
i
i
dare
not
accuse
my
superior
stammered
the
monk
layton
glared
at
him
laying
the
paper
down
the
question
is
he
cried
which
would
you
sooner
offend
your
prior
who
will
be
prior
no
longer
presently
or
the
king
grace
who
will
remain
the
king
grace
for
many
years
yet
by
the
favour
of
god
and
who
has
moreover
supreme
rights
of
life
and
death
that
is
your
choice
reverend
father
he
lifted
the
paper
by
the
you
have
only
to
say
the
word
sir
and
i
tear
up
this
paper
and
write
my
own
report
of
the
matter
the
monk
again
glanced
helplessly
at
the
two
men
ralph
had
a
touch
of
contentment
at
the
thought
that
this
was
christopher
superior
ranged
like
a
naughty
boy
at
the
table
and
looked
at
him
coldly
layton
made
a
swift
gesture
as
if
to
tear
the
paper
and
the
threw
out
his
hands
i
will
sign
it
sir
he
said
i
will
sign
it
when
the
monk
had
left
the
room
leaving
his
signed
confession
behind
him
layton
turned
beaming
to
ralph
thank
god
he
said
piously
i
do
not
know
what
we
should
have
done
if
he
had
refused
but
now
we
hold
him
and
his
prior
too
how
have
you
fared
mr
torridon
ralph
told
him
a
little
of
his
experiences
since
his
last
report
of
a
nunnery
where
all
but
three
had
been
either
dismissed
or
released
of
a
monastery
where
he
had
actually
caught
a
drunken
cellarer
unconscious
by
a
barrel
and
of
another
where
he
had
reason
to
fear
even
worse
crimes
write
it
all
down
torridon
cried
the
priest
and
do
not
spare
the
adjectives
i
have
some
fine
tales
for
you
myself
but
we
must
despatch
this
place
first
we
shall
have
grand
sport
in
the
this
prior
is
a
poor
timid
fellow
and
we
can
do
what
we
will
with
him
concealed
treason
is
a
sharp
sword
to
threaten
him
with
ralph
remarked
presently
that
he
had
a
brother
a
monk
here
but
you
can
do
what
you
like
to
him
he
said
i
have
no
love
for
him
he
is
an
insolent
fellow
layton
smiled
pleasantly
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
he
said
ralph
slept
that
night
in
the
in
the
same
room
that
chris
had
occupied
on
his
first
coming
he
awoke
once
at
the
sound
of
the
great
bell
from
the
tower
calling
the
monks
to
the
and
smiled
at
the
fantastic
folly
of
it
all
his
work
during
the
last
month
had
erased
the
last
remnants
of
superstitious
fear
and
to
him
now
more
than
ever
the
religious
houses
were
but
noisy
rookeries
clamant
with
bells
and
chanting
and
foul
with
the
refuse
of
idleness
the
sooner
they
were
silenced
and
purged
the
better
he
did
not
trouble
to
go
to
mass
in
the
morning
but
lay
awake
in
the
room
hearing
footsteps
and
voices
below
and
watching
the
morning
light
brighten
on
the
wall
he
found
himself
wondering
once
or
twice
what
chris
was
doing
and
how
he
felt
he
did
not
rise
till
one
of
his
men
looked
in
to
tell
him
that
layton
would
be
ready
for
him
in
if
he
pleased
the
was
a
strange
sight
as
he
entered
it
from
the
cloister
it
was
a
high
oblong
chamber
some
fifty
feet
long
with
arched
roof
like
a
chapel
and
a
paved
floor
on
a
dozen
stones
or
so
were
cut
inscriptions
recording
the
presence
of
bodies
entombed
below
among
them
those
of
earl
william
de
warenne
and
gundrada
his
wife
founders
of
the
priory
five
centuries
ago
ralph
caught
sight
of
the
names
as
he
strode
through
the
silent
monks
at
the
door
and
entered
the
chamber
talking
loudly
with
his
the
tall
vaulted
room
looked
bare
and
severe
the
seats
ran
round
it
raised
on
a
step
and
before
the
chair
beneath
the
crucifix
stood
a
large
table
covered
with
papers
beneath
it
and
emerging
on
to
the
floor
lay
a
great
heap
of
vestments
and
precious
things
which
layton
had
ordered
to
be
piled
there
for
his
inspection
and
on
the
table
itself
for
greater
dignity
burned
two
tapers
in
massive
silver
candlesticks
sit
here
torridon
said
the
priest
himself
taking
the
chair
we
represent
the
supreme
head
of
the
church
of
england
now
you
must
remember
and
he
smiled
at
the
other
with
a
solemn
joy
he
glanced
over
his
papers
settled
himself
judicially
and
then
signed
to
one
of
his
men
to
call
the
monks
in
his
two
secretaries
seated
themselves
at
either
end
of
the
table
that
stood
before
their
master
then
the
two
lines
began
to
file
in
in
reverse
order
as
the
doctor
had
commanded
black
silent
figures
with
bowed
heads
buried
in
their
hoods
and
their
hands
invisible
in
the
great
sleeves
of
their
cowls
ralph
ran
his
eyes
over
them
there
were
men
of
all
ages
there
old
wrinkled
faces
and
smooth
ones
but
it
was
not
until
they
were
all
standing
in
their
places
that
he
recognised
chris
there
stood
the
young
man
at
a
stall
near
the
door
his
eyes
bent
down
and
his
face
deadly
pale
his
figure
thin
and
rigid
against
the
pale
oak
panelling
that
rose
up
some
eight
feet
from
the
floor
ralph
heart
quickened
with
triumph
ah
it
was
good
to
be
here
as
judge
with
that
brother
of
his
as
culprit
the
prior
and
whose
places
were
occupied
stood
together
in
the
centre
of
the
room
as
the
doctor
had
ordered
it
was
their
case
that
was
to
come
first
there
was
an
impressive
silence
the
two
visitors
sat
motionless
looking
severely
round
them
the
secretaries
had
their
clean
paper
before
them
and
their
pens
ready
dipped
poised
in
their
fingers
then
layton
began
it
was
an
inexpressibly
painful
task
he
said
that
he
had
before
him
the
monks
were
not
to
think
that
he
gloried
in
it
or
loved
to
find
fault
and
impose
punishments
and
in
fact
nothing
but
the
knowledge
that
he
was
there
as
the
representative
of
the
supreme
authority
in
church
and
state
could
have
supplied
to
him
the
fortitude
necessary
for
the
performance
of
so
sad
a
task
ralph
marvelled
at
him
as
he
listened
there
was
a
solemn
sound
in
the
man
face
and
voice
and
dignity
in
his
few
and
impressive
gestures
it
could
hardly
be
believed
that
he
was
not
in
earnest
and
yet
ralph
remembered
too
the
relish
with
which
the
man
had
dispersed
his
foul
tales
the
evening
before
and
the
cackling
laughter
with
which
their
recital
was
accompanied
but
it
was
all
very
wholesome
for
chris
he
thought
and
now
said
layton
i
must
lay
before
you
this
grievous
matter
it
is
one
of
whose
end
i
dare
not
think
if
it
should
come
before
the
king
grace
and
yet
so
it
must
come
it
is
no
less
a
matter
than
treason
his
voice
rang
out
with
a
melancholy
triumph
and
ralph
looking
at
the
two
monks
who
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room
saw
that
they
were
both
as
white
as
paper
the
lips
of
the
prior
were
moving
in
a
kind
of
agonised
entreaty
and
his
eyes
rolled
round
you
sir
cried
the
doctor
glaring
at
the
who
dropped
his
beseeching
eyes
at
the
fierce
look
you
sir
have
committed
the
crime
in
ignorance
you
tell
me
but
at
least
the
crime
of
preaching
in
this
in
the
presence
of
his
grace
faithful
subjects
a
sermon
attacking
the
king
most
certain
prerogatives
i
can
make
perhaps
allowances
for
this
though
i
do
not
know
whether
his
grace
will
do
so
but
i
can
make
allowances
for
one
so
foolish
as
yourself
carried
away
by
the
drunkenness
of
words
but
i
can
make
none
none
he
shouted
crashing
his
hand
upon
the
table
none
for
your
superior
who
stands
beside
you
and
who
forebore
either
to
protest
at
the
treason
at
the
time
or
to
rebuke
it
afterwards
the
prior
hands
rose
and
clasped
themselves
convulsively
but
he
made
no
answer
layton
proceeded
to
read
out
the
confession
that
he
had
wrung
from
the
monk
the
night
before
down
to
the
signature
then
he
called
upon
him
to
come
up
is
this
your
name
sir
he
asked
slowly
the
took
the
paper
in
his
trembling
hands
it
is
sir
he
said
you
hear
it
cried
the
doctor
staring
fiercely
round
the
faces
he
tells
you
he
has
subscribed
it
himself
go
back
to
your
place
reverend
father
and
thank
our
lord
that
you
had
courage
to
do
so
and
now
you
sir
master
prior
what
have
you
to
say
layton
dropped
his
voice
as
he
spoke
and
laid
his
fat
hands
together
on
the
table
the
prior
looked
up
with
the
same
dreadful
entreaty
as
before
his
lips
moved
but
no
sound
came
from
them
the
monks
round
were
deadly
still
ralph
saw
a
swift
glance
or
two
exchanged
beneath
the
shrouding
hoods
but
no
one
moved
i
am
waiting
my
lord
prior
cried
layton
in
a
loud
terrible
voice
again
the
prior
writhed
his
lips
to
speak
layton
rose
abruptly
and
made
a
violent
gesture
down
on
your
knees
master
prior
if
you
need
mercy
there
was
a
quick
murmur
and
ripple
along
the
two
lines
as
the
prior
dropped
suddenly
on
to
his
knees
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
layton
threw
out
his
hand
with
a
passionate
gesture
and
began
to
speak
there
reverend
fathers
and
brethren
he
cried
you
see
how
low
sin
brings
a
man
this
fellow
who
calls
himself
prior
was
bold
enough
i
daresay
in
the
church
when
treason
was
preached
and
i
doubt
not
has
been
bold
enough
in
private
too
when
he
thought
none
heard
him
but
his
friends
but
you
see
how
treachery
heinous
treachery
plucks
the
spirit
from
him
and
how
lowly
he
carries
himself
when
he
knows
that
true
men
are
sitting
in
judgment
over
him
take
example
from
that
you
who
have
served
him
in
the
past
you
need
never
fear
him
more
now
layton
dropped
his
hand
and
sat
down
for
one
moment
ralph
saw
the
kneeling
man
lift
that
white
face
again
but
the
doctor
was
at
him
instantly
do
not
dare
to
rise
sir
till
i
give
you
leave
he
roared
you
had
best
be
a
penitent
now
tell
me
sir
what
you
have
to
say
it
shall
not
be
said
that
we
condemned
a
man
unheard
eh
mr
torridon
ralph
nodded
sharply
and
glanced
at
chris
but
his
brother
was
staring
at
the
prior
now
then
sir
cried
the
doctor
again
i
entreat
you
master
layton
the
prior
voice
was
convulsed
with
terror
as
he
cried
this
with
outstretched
hands
yes
sir
i
will
hear
you
i
entreat
you
sir
not
to
tell
his
grace
indeed
i
am
innocent
his
voice
rose
thin
and
high
in
his
panic
indeed
i
did
not
know
it
was
treason
that
was
preached
did
not
know
sneered
the
doctor
leaning
forward
over
the
table
why
you
know
your
faith
man
master
layton
master
layton
there
be
so
many
changes
in
these
days
changes
shouted
the
priest
there
be
no
changes
except
of
such
knaves
as
you
it
is
the
old
faith
now
as
ever
do
you
dare
to
call
his
grace
a
heretic
must
that
too
go
down
in
the
charges
no
no
master
layton
screamed
the
prior
with
his
hands
strained
forward
and
twitching
fingers
i
did
not
mean
that
christ
is
my
witness
is
it
not
the
same
faith
sir
yes
master
layton
yes
indeed
it
is
but
i
did
not
know
how
could
i
know
then
why
are
you
prior
cried
the
doctor
with
a
dramatic
gesture
if
it
is
not
to
keep
your
subjects
true
and
obedient
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
i
entreat
you
sir
for
the
love
of
mary
not
to
tell
his
grace
bah
shouted
layton
you
may
keep
your
breath
till
you
tell
his
grace
that
himself
there
is
enough
of
this
again
he
rose
and
swept
his
eyes
round
the
monks
i
am
weary
of
this
work
the
fellow
has
not
a
word
to
say
master
layton
master
layton
cried
the
kneeling
man
once
more
lifting
his
hands
on
one
of
which
gleamed
the
prelatical
ring
silence
sir
roared
the
doctor
it
is
i
who
am
speaking
now
we
have
had
enough
of
this
work
it
seems
that
there
be
no
true
men
left
except
in
the
world
these
houses
are
rotten
with
crime
is
it
not
so
master
torridon
rotten
with
crime
but
of
all
the
knaves
that
i
did
ever
meet
and
they
are
many
and
strong
ones
i
do
believe
master
prior
that
you
are
the
worst
here
is
my
sentence
and
see
that
it
be
carried
out
you
master
prior
and
you
master
are
to
appear
before
master
cromwell
in
his
court
on
eve
and
tell
your
tales
to
him
you
shall
see
if
he
be
so
soft
as
i
it
may
be
that
he
will
send
you
before
the
king
grace
that
i
know
not
but
at
least
he
will
know
how
to
get
the
truth
out
of
you
if
i
can
not
once
more
the
prior
broke
in
in
an
agony
of
terror
but
the
doctor
silenced
him
in
a
moment
have
i
not
given
my
sentence
sir
how
dare
you
speak
a
murmur
again
ran
round
the
room
and
he
lifted
his
hand
furiously
silence
he
shouted
not
one
word
from
a
mother
son
of
you
i
have
had
enough
of
sedition
already
clear
the
room
officer
and
let
not
one
shaveling
monk
put
his
nose
within
again
until
i
send
for
him
i
am
weary
of
them
all
weary
and
the
doctor
dropped
back
into
his
seat
with
a
face
of
profound
disgust
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
the
monks
turned
at
the
signal
from
the
door
and
ralph
watched
the
black
lines
once
more
file
out
there
torridon
whispered
the
doctor
behind
his
hand
did
i
not
tell
you
so
master
cromwell
will
be
able
to
do
what
he
will
with
him
chapter
viii
ralph
return
the
visitation
of
lewes
priory
occupied
a
couple
of
days
as
the
estates
were
so
vast
and
the
so
numerous
in
the
afternoon
following
the
scene
in
the
layton
and
ralph
rode
out
to
inspect
some
of
the
farms
that
were
at
hand
leaving
orders
that
the
stock
was
to
be
driven
up
into
the
court
the
next
day
and
did
not
return
till
dusk
the
excitement
in
the
town
was
tremendous
as
they
rode
back
through
the
streets
and
as
the
rumour
ran
along
who
the
great
gentlemen
were
that
went
along
so
gaily
with
their
servants
behind
them
and
by
the
time
that
they
reached
the
there
was
a
considerable
mob
following
in
their
train
singing
and
shouting
in
the
highest
spirits
at
the
thought
of
the
plunder
that
would
probably
fall
into
their
hands
layton
turned
in
his
saddle
at
the
door
and
made
them
a
little
speech
telling
them
how
he
was
there
with
the
authority
of
the
king
grace
and
would
soon
make
a
sweep
of
the
place
and
there
will
be
pickings
he
cried
pickings
for
us
all
the
widow
and
the
orphan
have
been
robbed
long
enough
it
is
time
to
spoil
the
fathers
there
was
a
roar
of
amusement
from
the
mob
and
a
shout
or
two
was
raised
for
the
king
grace
you
must
be
patient
cried
layton
and
then
no
more
taxes
you
can
trust
us
gentlemen
to
do
the
king
work
as
it
should
be
done
as
he
passed
in
through
the
entrance
he
turned
to
ralph
again
you
see
torridon
we
have
the
country
behind
us
it
was
that
evening
that
ralph
for
the
first
time
since
the
quarrel
met
his
brother
face
to
face
he
was
passing
through
the
cloister
on
his
way
to
layton
room
and
came
past
the
refectory
door
just
as
the
monks
were
gathering
for
supper
he
glanced
in
as
he
went
and
had
a
glimpse
of
the
clean
solemn
hall
lighted
with
candles
along
the
panelling
the
long
bare
tables
laid
ready
the
prior
chair
and
table
at
the
further
end
and
the
great
fresco
over
it
a
lay
brother
or
two
in
aprons
were
going
about
their
business
silently
and
three
or
four
black
figures
who
had
already
entered
stood
motionless
along
the
raised
dais
on
which
the
tables
stood
the
monks
had
all
stopped
instantly
as
ralph
came
among
them
and
had
lowered
their
hoods
with
their
accustomed
courtly
deference
to
a
guest
and
as
he
turned
from
his
momentary
pause
at
the
refectory
door
in
the
full
blaze
of
light
that
shone
from
it
he
met
chris
face
to
face
the
young
monk
had
come
up
that
instant
not
noticing
who
was
there
and
his
hood
was
still
over
his
head
there
was
a
second
pause
and
then
he
lifted
his
hand
and
threw
the
hood
back
in
salutation
and
as
ralph
bowed
and
passed
on
he
had
a
moment
sight
of
that
thin
face
and
the
large
grey
eyes
in
which
there
was
not
the
faintest
sign
of
recognition
ralph
heart
was
hot
with
mingled
emotion
as
he
went
up
the
cloister
he
was
more
disturbed
by
the
sudden
meeting
the
act
of
courtesy
and
the
cold
steady
eyes
of
this
young
fool
of
a
brother
than
he
cared
to
recognise
he
saw
no
more
of
him
except
in
the
distance
among
his
fellows
and
he
left
the
house
the
next
day
when
the
business
was
done
matters
in
the
rest
of
england
were
going
forward
with
the
same
promptitude
as
in
sussex
layton
himself
had
visited
the
west
earlier
in
the
autumn
and
the
other
visitors
were
busy
in
other
parts
of
the
country
the
report
was
current
now
that
the
resources
of
all
the
religious
houses
were
to
be
certainly
confiscated
and
that
those
of
the
inmates
who
still
persisted
in
their
vocation
would
have
to
do
so
under
the
most
rigorous
conditions
imaginable
the
results
were
to
be
seen
in
the
enormous
increase
of
beggars
deprived
now
of
the
hospitality
they
were
accustomed
to
receive
and
the
roads
everywhere
were
thronged
with
those
who
had
been
holders
of
corrodies
or
daily
sustenance
in
the
houses
as
well
as
with
the
evicted
religious
some
of
whom
dismissed
against
their
will
were
on
their
way
to
the
universities
where
in
spite
of
the
visitation
it
was
thought
that
support
was
still
to
be
had
and
others
less
reputable
who
preferred
freedom
to
monastic
discipline
yet
others
were
to
be
met
with
though
not
many
in
number
who
were
on
their
way
to
london
to
lay
complaints
of
various
kinds
against
their
superiors
from
these
and
like
events
the
whole
country
was
astir
men
gathered
in
groups
outside
the
village
inns
and
discussed
the
situation
and
feeling
ran
high
on
the
movements
of
the
day
what
chiefly
encouraged
the
malcontents
was
the
fact
that
the
benefits
to
be
gained
by
the
dissolution
of
the
monasteries
were
evident
and
present
while
the
lay
in
the
future
the
great
religious
houses
their
farms
and
stock
the
jewels
of
the
treasury
were
visible
objects
men
actually
laid
eyes
on
them
as
they
went
to
and
from
their
work
or
knelt
at
mass
on
sundays
it
was
all
so
much
wealth
that
did
not
belong
to
them
and
that
might
do
so
while
the
corrodies
the
daily
hospitality
the
employment
of
labour
and
such
things
lay
either
out
of
sight
or
affected
only
certain
individuals
characters
too
that
were
chiefly
stirred
by
such
arguments
were
those
of
the
noisy
and
faction
while
those
who
saw
a
little
deeper
into
things
and
understood
the
enormous
charities
of
the
religious
houses
and
the
manner
in
which
extreme
poverty
was
kept
in
check
by
them
even
more
those
who
valued
the
spiritual
benefits
that
flowed
from
the
fact
of
their
existence
and
saw
how
life
was
kindled
and
inspired
by
these
vast
homes
of
prayer
such
then
as
always
were
those
who
would
not
voluntarily
put
themselves
forward
in
debate
or
be
able
when
they
did
so
to
use
arguments
that
would
appeal
to
the
village
gatherings
their
natural
leaders
too
the
country
clergy
who
alone
might
have
pointed
out
effectively
the
considerations
that
lay
beneath
the
surface
had
been
skilfully
and
peremptorily
silenced
by
the
episcopal
withdrawing
of
all
preaching
licenses
in
the
course
of
ralph
travels
he
came
across
more
than
once
a
hot
scene
in
the
village
inn
and
was
able
to
use
his
own
personality
and
prestige
as
a
king
visitor
in
the
direction
that
he
wished
he
came
for
example
one
saturday
night
to
the
little
village
of
maresfield
near
fletching
and
after
seeing
his
horses
and
servants
bestowed
came
into
the
parlour
where
the
magnates
were
assembled
there
were
half
a
dozen
there
sitting
round
the
fire
who
rose
respectfully
as
the
great
gentleman
strode
in
and
eyed
him
with
a
sudden
awe
as
they
realised
from
the
landlord
winks
and
whispers
that
he
was
of
a
very
considerable
importance
from
the
nature
of
his
training
ralph
had
learnt
how
to
deal
with
all
conditions
of
men
and
by
the
time
that
he
had
finished
supper
and
drawn
his
chair
to
the
fire
they
were
talking
freely
again
as
indeed
he
had
encouraged
them
to
do
for
they
did
not
of
course
any
more
than
the
landlord
guess
at
his
identity
or
his
business
there
ralph
soon
brought
the
talk
round
again
to
the
old
subject
and
asked
the
opinions
of
the
company
as
to
the
king
policy
in
the
visitation
of
the
religious
houses
there
was
a
general
silence
when
he
first
opened
the
debate
for
they
were
dangerous
times
but
the
gentleman
own
imperturbable
air
his
evident
importance
and
his
friendliness
conspired
with
the
strong
beer
to
open
their
mouths
and
in
five
minutes
they
were
at
it
one
a
little
old
man
in
the
corner
who
sat
with
crossed
legs
nursing
his
mug
declared
that
to
his
mind
the
whole
thing
was
sacrilege
the
houses
he
said
had
been
endowed
to
god
glory
and
service
and
that
to
turn
them
to
other
uses
must
bring
a
curse
on
the
country
he
went
on
to
remark
for
ralph
deftly
silenced
the
chorus
of
protest
that
his
own
people
had
been
buried
in
the
church
of
the
dominican
friars
at
arundel
for
three
generations
and
that
he
was
sorry
for
the
man
who
laid
hands
on
the
tomb
of
his
grandfather
known
as
uncle
john
for
the
old
man
had
been
a
desperate
churchman
in
his
day
and
would
undoubtedly
revenge
himself
for
any
indignity
offered
to
his
bones
ralph
pointed
out
with
a
considerate
that
the
illustration
was
scarcely
to
the
point
for
the
king
grace
had
no
intention
he
believed
of
disturbing
any
one
bones
the
question
at
issue
rather
regarded
flesh
and
blood
then
a
chorus
broke
out
and
the
hunt
was
up
one
the
butcher
with
many
blessings
invoked
on
king
harry
head
declared
that
the
country
was
being
sucked
dry
by
these
rapacious
ecclesiastics
that
the
monks
encroached
every
year
on
the
common
land
absorbed
the
little
farms
paid
inadequate
wages
and
which
appeared
his
principal
grievance
killed
their
own
meat
ralph
with
praiseworthy
tolerance
pushed
this
last
argument
aside
but
appeared
to
reflect
on
the
others
as
if
they
were
new
to
him
though
he
had
heard
them
a
hundred
times
and
used
them
fifty
and
while
he
weighed
them
another
took
up
the
tale
told
a
scandalous
story
or
two
and
asked
how
men
who
lived
such
lives
as
these
which
he
related
could
be
examples
of
chastity
once
more
the
little
old
man
burst
into
the
fray
and
waving
his
pot
in
an
access
of
religious
enthusiasm
rebuked
the
last
speaker
for
his
readiness
to
pick
up
dirt
and
himself
instanced
five
or
six
religious
known
to
him
whose
lives
were
no
less
spotless
than
his
own
again
ralph
interposed
in
his
slow
voice
and
told
them
that
that
too
was
not
the
point
at
issue
the
question
was
not
as
to
whether
here
and
there
monks
lived
good
lives
or
bad
for
no
one
was
compelled
to
imitate
either
but
as
to
whether
on
the
whole
the
existence
of
the
religious
houses
was
profitable
in
such
practical
matters
as
agriculture
trade
and
the
relief
of
the
destitute
and
so
it
went
on
and
ralph
began
to
grow
weary
of
the
inconsequence
of
the
debaters
and
their
entire
inability
to
hold
to
the
salient
points
but
he
still
kept
his
hand
on
the
rudder
of
the
discussion
avoided
the
fogs
of
the
supernatural
and
religious
on
the
one
side
towards
which
the
little
old
man
persisted
in
pushing
and
on
the
other
the
blunt
views
of
the
butcher
and
the
man
who
had
told
the
foul
stories
and
contented
himself
with
watching
and
learning
the
opinion
of
the
company
rather
than
contributing
his
own
towards
the
end
of
the
evening
he
observed
two
of
his
men
who
had
slipped
in
and
were
sitting
at
the
back
of
the
little
stifling
room
hugely
enjoying
the
irony
of
the
situation
and
determined
on
ending
the
discussion
with
an
announcement
of
his
own
identity
presently
an
opportunity
occurred
the
little
old
man
had
shown
a
dangerous
tendency
to
discourse
on
the
suffering
souls
in
purgatory
and
on
the
miseries
inflicted
on
them
by
the
cessation
of
masses
and
suffrages
for
their
welfare
and
an
uncomfortable
silence
had
fallen
on
the
others
ralph
stood
up
abruptly
and
began
to
speak
his
bright
tired
eyes
shining
down
on
the
solemn
faces
and
his
mouth
set
and
precise
well
gentlemen
he
said
your
talk
has
pleased
me
very
much
i
have
learned
a
great
deal
and
i
hope
shall
profit
by
it
some
of
you
have
talked
a
quantity
of
nonsense
and
you
miggers
have
talked
the
most
about
your
uncle
john
soul
and
bones
a
deadly
silence
fell
as
these
startling
words
were
pronounced
for
his
manner
up
to
now
had
been
conciliatory
and
almost
apologetic
but
he
went
on
imperturbably
i
am
quite
sure
that
almighty
god
knows
his
business
better
than
you
or
i
miggers
and
if
he
can
not
take
care
of
uncle
john
without
the
aid
of
masses
or
dirges
sung
by
monks
he
stopped
abruptly
and
a
squirt
of
laughter
burst
from
the
butcher
well
this
is
my
opinion
went
on
ralph
if
you
wish
to
know
it
i
do
not
think
or
suspect
as
some
of
you
do
but
i
as
you
will
allow
presently
that
i
do
when
i
tell
you
who
i
am
i
that
these
houses
of
which
we
have
been
speaking
are
nothing
better
than
the
fellows
look
holy
enough
in
their
liveries
they
make
a
deal
of
buzz
they
go
to
and
fro
as
if
on
business
but
they
make
no
honey
that
is
worth
your
while
or
mine
to
take
there
is
but
one
thing
that
they
have
in
their
holes
that
is
worth
anything
and
that
is
their
jewels
and
their
gold
and
the
lead
on
their
churches
and
the
bells
in
their
towers
and
all
that
by
the
grace
of
god
we
will
soon
have
out
of
them
there
was
a
faint
murmur
of
mingled
applause
and
dissent
miggers
stared
at
this
preposterous
stranger
and
set
his
mug
resolutely
down
as
a
preparation
for
addressing
him
but
he
had
no
opportunity
ralph
was
warmed
now
by
his
own
eloquence
and
swept
on
you
think
i
do
not
know
of
what
i
am
speaking
well
i
have
a
brother
a
monk
at
lewes
and
a
sister
a
nun
at
rusper
and
i
have
been
brought
up
in
this
religion
until
i
am
weary
of
it
my
sister
well
she
is
like
other
maidens
of
her
kind
not
a
word
to
speak
of
any
matter
but
our
lady
and
the
saints
and
how
many
candles
saint
christopher
likes
and
my
brother
well
we
can
leave
that
i
know
these
houses
as
none
of
you
know
them
i
know
how
much
wine
they
drink
how
much
they
charge
for
their
masses
how
much
treasonable
chatter
they
carry
on
in
private
i
know
their
lives
as
i
know
my
own
and
i
know
that
they
are
rotten
and
useless
altogether
they
may
give
a
plateful
or
two
in
charity
and
a
mug
of
beer
they
gorge
ten
dishes
themselves
and
swill
a
hogshead
they
give
a
penny
to
the
poor
man
and
keep
twenty
nobles
for
themselves
they
take
field
after
field
house
after
house
turn
the
farmer
into
the
beggar
and
the
beggar
into
their
bedesman
and
by
god
i
say
that
the
sooner
king
henry
gets
rid
of
the
crew
the
better
for
you
and
me
ralph
snapped
out
the
last
words
and
stared
insolently
down
on
the
gaping
faces
then
he
finished
standing
by
the
door
as
he
did
so
with
his
hand
on
the
latch
if
you
would
know
how
i
know
all
this
i
will
tell
you
my
name
is
torridon
of
overfield
and
i
am
one
of
the
king
visitors
gentlemen
there
was
the
silence
of
the
grave
within
as
ralph
went
upstairs
smiling
to
himself
ralph
had
intended
returning
home
a
week
or
two
after
the
lewes
visitation
but
there
was
a
good
deal
to
be
done
and
layton
had
pointed
out
to
him
that
even
if
some
houses
were
visited
twice
over
it
would
do
no
harm
to
the
rich
monks
to
pay
double
fees
so
it
was
not
till
christmas
was
a
week
away
that
he
rode
at
last
up
to
his
at
westminster
his
train
had
swelled
to
near
a
dozen
men
and
horses
by
now
for
he
had
accumulated
a
good
deal
of
treasure
beside
that
which
he
had
left
in
layton
hands
and
it
would
not
have
been
safe
to
travel
with
a
smaller
escort
so
it
was
a
gay
and
imposing
cavalcade
that
clattered
through
the
narrow
streets
ralph
himself
rode
in
front
in
solitary
dignity
his
weapon
jingling
at
his
stirrup
his
feather
spruce
and
bright
above
his
spare
keen
face
a
couple
of
servants
rode
behind
fully
armed
and
formidable
looking
and
then
the
train
came
behind
beasts
piled
with
bundles
that
rustled
and
clinked
suggestively
and
the
men
who
guarded
them
gay
with
scraps
of
embroidery
and
a
cheap
jewel
or
two
here
and
there
in
their
dress
but
ralph
did
not
feel
so
gallant
as
he
looked
during
these
long
country
rides
he
had
had
too
much
time
to
think
and
the
thought
of
beatrice
and
of
what
she
would
say
seldom
left
him
the
very
harshness
of
his
experiences
the
rough
faces
round
him
the
dialect
of
the
stable
and
the
inn
the
coarse
conversation
all
served
to
make
her
image
the
more
gracious
and
alluring
it
was
a
kind
of
worship
shot
with
passion
that
he
felt
for
her
her
grave
silences
coincided
with
his
own
her
tenderness
yielded
deliciously
to
his
strength
as
he
sat
over
his
fire
with
his
men
whispering
behind
him
planning
as
they
thought
new
assaults
on
the
rich
nests
that
they
all
hated
and
coveted
together
again
and
again
it
was
beatrice
face
and
not
that
of
a
shrewd
or
anxious
monk
that
burned
in
the
red
heart
of
the
hearth
he
had
seen
it
with
downcast
eyes
with
the
long
lashes
lying
on
the
cheek
and
the
curved
red
lips
discreetly
shut
beneath
the
masses
of
black
hair
shadowed
the
forehead
and
darkened
the
secret
that
he
wished
to
read
or
he
had
watched
her
like
a
jewel
in
a
looking
across
the
farm
where
he
had
had
to
sleep
more
than
once
with
his
men
about
him
her
black
eyes
looking
into
his
own
with
tender
gravity
and
her
mouth
trembling
with
speech
or
best
of
all
as
he
rode
along
the
bitter
cold
lanes
at
the
fall
of
the
day
the
crowding
yews
above
him
had
parted
and
let
her
stand
there
with
her
long
skirts
rustling
in
the
dry
leaves
her
slender
figure
blending
with
the
darkness
and
her
sweet
face
trusting
and
loving
him
out
of
the
gloom
and
then
again
like
the
prick
of
a
wound
the
question
had
touched
him
how
would
she
receive
him
when
he
came
back
with
the
monastic
spoils
on
his
beasts
shoulders
and
the
wail
of
the
nuns
shrilling
like
the
wind
behind
but
by
the
time
that
he
came
back
to
london
he
had
thought
out
his
method
of
meeting
her
probably
she
had
had
news
of
the
doings
of
the
visitors
perhaps
of
his
own
in
particular
it
was
hardly
possible
that
his
father
had
not
written
she
would
ask
for
an
explanation
and
she
should
have
instead
an
appeal
to
her
confidence
he
would
tell
her
that
sad
things
had
indeed
happened
that
he
had
been
forced
to
be
present
at
and
even
to
carry
out
incidents
which
he
deplored
but
that
he
had
done
his
utmost
to
be
merciful
it
was
rough
work
he
would
say
but
it
was
work
that
had
to
be
done
and
since
that
was
so
and
this
was
teaching
it
was
better
that
honourable
gentlemen
should
do
it
he
had
not
been
able
always
to
restrain
the
violence
of
his
men
and
for
that
he
needed
forgiveness
from
her
dear
lips
and
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
tell
stories
against
him
that
it
would
be
hard
to
disprove
but
if
she
loved
and
trusted
him
and
he
knew
that
she
did
let
her
take
his
word
for
it
that
no
injustice
had
been
deliberately
done
that
on
the
other
hand
he
had
been
the
means
under
god
of
restraining
many
such
acts
and
that
his
conscience
was
clear
it
was
a
moving
appeal
ralph
thought
and
it
almost
convinced
himself
he
was
not
conscious
of
any
gross
insincerity
in
the
defence
of
course
it
was
shaded
artistically
and
the
more
brutal
details
kept
out
of
sight
but
in
the
main
it
was
surely
true
and
as
he
rehearsed
its
points
to
himself
once
more
in
the
streets
of
westminster
he
felt
that
though
there
might
be
a
painful
moment
or
two
yet
it
would
do
his
work
he
had
sent
a
message
home
that
he
was
coming
and
the
door
of
his
home
was
wide
as
he
dismounted
and
the
pleasant
light
of
candles
shone
out
for
the
evening
was
smouldering
to
dark
in
the
west
a
crowd
had
collected
as
he
went
along
from
every
window
faces
were
leaning
and
as
he
stood
on
the
steps
directing
the
removal
of
the
treasure
into
the
house
he
saw
that
the
mob
filled
the
tiny
street
and
the
cobbled
space
from
side
to
side
they
were
chiefly
of
the
idling
class
folks
who
had
little
to
do
but
to
follow
up
excitements
and
shout
and
there
were
a
good
many
cries
raised
for
the
king
grace
and
his
visitors
for
such
people
as
these
were
greedy
for
any
movement
that
might
bring
them
gain
and
the
religious
houses
were
beginning
to
be
more
unpopular
in
town
than
ever
one
of
the
bundles
slipped
as
it
was
shifted
the
cord
came
off
and
in
a
moment
the
little
space
beyond
the
mule
before
the
door
was
covered
with
gleaming
stuff
and
jewels
there
was
a
fierce
scuffle
and
a
cry
and
ralph
was
in
a
moment
beyond
the
mule
with
his
sword
out
he
said
nothing
but
stood
there
fierce
and
alert
as
the
crowd
sucked
back
and
the
servant
gathered
up
the
things
there
was
no
more
trouble
for
it
had
only
been
a
spasmodic
snatch
at
the
wealth
and
a
cheer
or
two
was
raised
again
among
the
grimy
faces
that
stared
at
the
fine
gentleman
and
the
shining
treasure
ralph
thought
it
better
however
to
say
a
conciliatory
word
when
the
things
had
been
bestowed
in
the
house
and
the
mules
led
away
and
he
stood
on
the
steps
a
moment
alone
before
entering
himself
the
crowd
listened
complacently
enough
to
the
statements
which
they
had
begun
to
believe
from
the
fact
of
the
incessant
dinning
of
them
into
their
ears
by
the
selected
preachers
at
paul
cross
and
elsewhere
and
there
was
loud
groan
at
the
pope
name
ralph
was
ending
with
an
incise
peroration
that
he
had
delivered
more
than
once
before
you
know
all
this
good
people
and
you
shall
know
it
better
when
the
work
is
done
instead
of
the
rich
friars
and
monks
we
will
have
godly
citizens
each
with
his
house
and
land
the
king
grace
has
promised
it
and
you
know
that
he
keeps
his
word
we
have
had
enough
of
the
jackdaws
and
their
stolen
goods
we
will
have
honest
birds
instead
only
be
patient
a
little
longer
the
listening
silence
was
broken
by
a
loud
cry
you
damned
plundering
hound
a
stone
suddenly
out
of
the
gloom
whizzed
past
ralph
and
crashed
through
the
window
behind
a
great
roaring
rose
in
a
moment
and
the
crowd
swayed
and
turned
ralph
felt
his
heart
suddenly
quicken
and
his
hand
flew
to
his
hilt
again
but
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
act
there
were
terrible
screams
already
rising
from
the
seething
twilight
in
front
as
the
was
seized
and
trampled
he
stayed
a
moment
longer
dropped
his
hilt
and
went
into
the
house
chapter
ix
ralph
welcome
you
will
show
mistress
atherton
into
the
room
below
said
ralph
to
his
man
as
soon
as
she
comes
he
was
sitting
on
the
morning
following
his
arrival
in
his
own
chamber
upstairs
his
table
was
a
mass
of
papers
reckonings
reports
bearing
on
his
visitation
journey
and
he
had
been
working
at
them
ever
since
he
was
dressed
for
he
had
to
present
himself
before
cromwell
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two
and
the
labour
would
be
enormous
the
room
below
opposite
that
in
which
he
intended
to
see
beatrice
and
where
she
had
waited
herself
a
few
months
before
while
he
talked
with
cromwell
and
the
archbishop
was
now
occupied
by
his
collection
of
plate
and
vestments
and
the
key
was
in
his
own
pocket
he
had
heard
from
his
housekeeper
on
the
previous
evening
that
beatrice
had
called
at
the
house
during
the
afternoon
and
had
seemed
surprised
to
hear
that
he
was
to
return
that
night
but
she
had
said
very
little
it
appeared
and
had
only
begged
the
woman
to
inform
her
master
that
she
would
present
herself
at
his
house
the
next
morning
and
now
ralph
was
waiting
for
her
he
was
more
than
he
had
expected
to
be
the
events
of
the
evening
before
had
given
him
a
curious
shock
and
he
cursed
the
whole
business
the
snapping
of
the
cord
round
the
bundle
his
own
action
and
words
the
outrage
that
followed
and
the
death
of
the
fellow
that
had
thrown
the
stone
for
the
body
had
been
rescued
by
the
watch
a
few
minutes
later
a
tattered
crushed
thing
beaten
out
of
all
likeness
to
a
man
one
of
the
watch
had
stepped
in
to
see
ralph
as
he
sat
at
supper
and
had
gone
again
saying
the
dog
deserved
it
for
daring
to
lift
his
voice
against
the
king
and
his
will
but
above
all
ralph
repented
of
his
own
words
there
was
no
harm
in
saying
such
things
in
the
country
but
it
was
foolish
and
rash
to
do
so
in
town
cromwell
men
should
be
silent
and
discreet
he
knew
not
and
if
he
had
had
time
to
think
he
would
not
have
spoken
however
the
crowd
was
with
him
there
was
plainly
no
one
of
any
importance
there
it
was
unlikely
that
cromwell
himself
would
hear
of
the
incident
and
perhaps
after
all
no
harm
was
done
meanwhile
there
was
beatrice
to
reckon
with
and
ralph
laid
down
his
pen
a
dozen
times
that
morning
and
rehearsed
once
more
what
he
would
have
to
say
to
her
he
was
shrewd
enough
to
know
that
it
was
his
personality
and
not
his
virtues
or
his
views
that
had
laid
hold
of
this
girl
soul
as
it
was
with
him
so
it
was
with
her
each
was
far
enough
apart
from
the
other
in
all
external
matters
such
things
had
been
left
behind
a
year
ago
it
was
not
an
affair
of
consonant
tastes
but
of
passion
from
each
there
had
looked
deep
inner
eyes
there
had
been
on
either
side
a
steady
and
fearless
scrutiny
and
then
the
two
souls
had
leapt
together
in
a
bright
flame
of
desire
knowing
that
each
was
made
for
the
other
there
had
been
so
little
so
few
speeches
after
the
first
meeting
or
two
so
few
letters
exchanged
and
fewer
embraces
the
last
veils
had
fallen
at
the
fury
of
chris
intervention
and
they
had
known
then
what
had
been
inevitable
all
along
ralph
smiled
to
himself
as
he
remembered
how
little
he
had
said
or
she
had
answered
there
had
been
no
need
to
say
anything
and
then
his
eyes
grew
wide
and
passionate
and
his
hands
gripped
one
another
fiercely
as
the
memory
died
and
the
burning
flame
of
desire
flared
within
him
again
from
the
deep
well
he
bore
in
his
heart
the
world
of
affairs
and
explanations
and
evasions
faded
into
twilight
and
there
was
but
one
thing
left
his
love
and
hers
it
was
to
that
that
he
would
appeal
he
sat
so
a
moment
longer
and
then
took
up
his
pen
again
though
it
shook
in
his
hand
and
went
on
with
his
reckonings
he
was
perfectly
composed
half
an
hour
later
as
he
went
downstairs
to
meet
her
he
had
finished
his
line
of
figures
sedately
when
the
man
looked
in
to
say
that
she
was
below
and
had
sat
yet
a
moment
longer
trying
to
remember
mechanically
what
it
was
he
had
determined
to
tell
her
bah
it
was
trifling
and
unimportant
words
did
not
affect
the
question
all
the
wrecked
convents
in
the
world
could
not
touch
the
one
fact
that
lay
in
fire
at
his
heart
he
would
say
nothing
she
would
understand
in
the
tiny
entrance
hall
there
was
a
whiff
of
fragrance
where
she
had
passed
through
and
his
heart
stirred
in
answer
then
he
opened
the
door
stepped
through
and
closed
it
behind
him
she
was
standing
upright
by
the
hearth
and
faced
him
as
he
entered
he
was
aware
of
her
blue
mantle
her
white
jewelled
one
hand
gripping
the
her
pale
steady
face
and
bright
eyes
behind
there
was
the
warm
rich
panelling
and
the
leaping
glow
of
the
wood
fire
she
made
no
movement
outside
the
lane
was
filled
with
street
noises
the
cries
of
children
the
voices
of
men
who
went
by
talking
the
rumble
of
a
waggon
coming
with
the
crack
of
whips
and
jingle
of
bells
from
the
river
the
wheels
came
up
and
went
past
into
silence
again
before
either
spoke
or
moved
then
ralph
lifted
his
hands
a
little
and
let
them
drop
as
he
stared
at
her
face
from
her
eyes
looked
out
her
will
tense
as
steel
and
his
own
shook
to
meet
it
well
she
said
at
last
and
her
voice
was
perfectly
steady
beatrice
cried
ralph
and
the
agony
of
it
tore
his
heart
she
dropped
her
hand
to
her
side
and
still
looked
at
him
without
flinching
beatrice
cried
ralph
once
more
then
you
have
no
more
to
say
after
last
night
a
torrent
of
thoughts
broke
loose
in
his
brain
and
he
tried
to
snatch
one
as
they
fled
past
to
say
one
word
his
excuses
went
by
him
like
phantoms
they
bewildered
and
dazed
him
why
there
were
a
thousand
things
to
say
and
each
was
convincing
if
he
could
but
say
it
the
cloud
passed
and
there
were
her
eyes
watching
him
still
then
that
is
all
she
said
again
the
cloud
fell
on
him
little
scenes
piteously
clear
rose
before
him
of
the
road
by
rusper
convent
layton
leering
face
a
stripped
altar
and
for
each
there
was
a
tale
if
he
could
but
tell
it
and
still
the
bright
eyes
never
flinched
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
she
was
watching
him
curiously
her
lips
were
parted
and
her
head
was
a
little
on
one
side
her
face
interested
and
impersonal
why
beatrice
he
cried
again
then
her
love
shook
her
like
a
storm
he
had
never
dreamed
she
could
look
like
that
her
mouth
shook
he
could
see
her
white
teeth
clenched
and
a
shiver
went
over
her
he
took
one
step
forward
but
stopped
again
for
the
black
eyes
shone
through
the
passion
that
swayed
her
as
keen
and
remorseless
as
ever
he
dropped
on
to
his
knees
at
the
table
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
he
knew
nothing
now
but
that
he
had
lost
her
that
was
her
voice
speaking
now
as
steady
as
her
eyes
but
he
did
not
hear
a
word
she
said
words
were
nothing
they
were
not
so
much
as
those
cries
from
the
street
that
shrill
boy
voice
over
the
way
not
so
much
as
the
sighing
crackle
from
the
hearth
where
he
had
caused
a
fire
to
be
lighted
lest
she
should
feel
cold
she
was
still
speaking
but
her
voice
had
moved
she
was
no
longer
by
the
fire
he
could
feel
the
warmth
of
the
fire
now
on
his
hands
but
he
dared
not
move
nor
look
up
there
was
but
one
thing
left
for
him
that
he
had
lost
her
that
was
her
hand
on
the
latch
a
breath
of
cold
air
stirred
his
hair
and
still
she
was
speaking
he
understood
a
little
more
now
she
knew
it
all
his
doings
what
he
had
said
last
night
and
there
was
not
one
word
to
say
in
answer
her
short
lashing
sentences
fell
on
his
defenceless
soul
but
all
sense
was
dead
and
he
watched
with
a
dazed
impersonalness
how
each
stroke
went
home
and
yet
he
felt
no
pain
or
shame
she
was
going
now
a
picture
stirred
on
the
wall
by
the
fire
as
the
wind
rushed
in
through
the
open
street
door
then
the
door
closed
part
ii
the
fall
of
lewes
chapter
i
internal
dissension
the
peace
was
gone
from
lewes
priory
a
wave
had
broken
in
through
the
high
wall
from
the
world
outside
with
the
coming
of
the
visitors
and
had
left
wreckage
behind
and
swept
out
security
as
it
went
the
monks
knew
now
that
their
old
privileges
were
gone
with
the
treasures
that
layton
had
taken
with
him
and
that
although
the
wave
had
recoiled
it
would
return
again
and
sweep
them
all
away
upon
none
of
them
had
the
blow
fallen
more
fiercely
than
on
chris
he
had
tried
to
find
peace
and
instead
was
in
the
midst
of
storm
the
high
barriers
had
gone
and
with
them
the
security
of
his
own
soul
and
the
world
that
he
thought
he
had
left
was
grinning
at
the
breach
it
was
piteous
to
him
to
see
the
prior
that
delicate
quiet
prelate
who
had
held
himself
aloof
in
his
dignities
now
humbled
by
the
shame
of
his
exposure
in
the
the
courage
that
bishop
fisher
had
restored
to
him
in
some
measure
was
gone
again
and
it
was
miserable
to
look
at
that
white
downcast
face
in
the
church
and
refectory
and
to
recognise
that
all
was
gone
after
his
return
from
his
appearance
before
cromwell
he
was
more
wretched
than
ever
it
was
known
that
he
had
been
sent
back
in
contemptuous
disgrace
but
it
was
not
known
how
much
he
had
promised
in
his
terror
for
life
the
house
had
lost
too
some
of
its
inmates
two
had
petitioned
for
release
three
professed
monks
had
been
dismissed
and
a
recent
novice
had
been
sent
back
to
his
home
their
places
in
the
stately
choir
were
empty
and
eloquent
with
warning
and
in
their
stead
was
a
fantastic
secular
priest
appointed
by
the
visitors
authority
who
seldom
said
mass
and
never
attended
choir
but
was
regular
in
the
refectory
and
the
where
he
thundered
paul
epistles
at
the
monks
and
commentaries
of
his
own
in
the
hopes
of
turning
them
from
papistry
to
a
purer
faith
the
news
from
outside
echoed
their
own
misery
week
after
week
the
tales
poured
in
of
young
and
old
dismissed
back
to
the
world
whose
ways
they
had
forgotten
of
the
rape
of
treasures
priceless
not
only
for
their
intrinsic
worth
but
for
the
love
that
had
given
and
consecrated
them
through
years
of
devout
service
there
was
not
a
house
that
had
not
lost
something
the
king
himself
had
sanctioned
the
work
by
taking
precious
horns
and
a
jewelled
cross
from
winchester
and
worse
than
all
that
had
gone
was
the
terror
of
what
was
yet
to
come
the
world
which
had
been
creeping
nearer
pausing
and
creeping
on
again
had
at
last
passed
the
boundaries
and
leapt
to
sacrilege
it
was
this
terror
that
poisoned
life
the
sacristan
who
polished
the
jewels
that
were
left
handled
them
doubtfully
now
the
monk
who
superintended
the
farm
sickened
as
he
made
his
plans
for
another
year
the
scribe
who
sat
in
the
carrel
lost
enthusiasm
for
his
work
for
the
jewels
in
a
few
months
might
be
on
royal
fingers
the
beasts
in
strangers
sheds
and
the
illuminated
leaves
blowing
over
the
cobbled
court
or
wrapped
round
grocers
stores
dom
anthony
preached
a
sermon
on
patience
one
day
in
christmastide
telling
his
fellows
that
a
man
life
and
still
less
a
monk
consisted
not
in
the
abundance
of
things
that
he
possessed
and
that
corporate
as
well
as
individual
poverty
had
been
the
ideal
of
the
monastic
houses
in
earlier
days
he
was
no
great
preacher
but
the
people
loved
to
hear
his
homely
remarks
and
there
was
a
murmur
of
sympathy
as
he
pointed
with
a
clumsy
gesture
to
the
lighted
crib
that
had
been
erected
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
great
pillars
in
the
nave
our
lady
wore
no
cloth
of
gold
he
said
nor
saint
joseph
a
precious
mitre
and
the
blessed
redeemer
himself
who
made
all
things
had
but
straw
to
his
bed
and
if
our
new
cope
is
gone
we
can
make
our
processions
in
the
old
one
and
please
god
no
less
nay
we
may
please
him
more
perhaps
for
he
knows
that
it
is
by
no
will
of
ours
that
we
do
so
but
there
had
been
a
dismal
scene
at
the
chapter
next
morning
the
prior
had
made
them
a
speech
with
a
passionate
white
face
and
hands
that
shook
and
declared
that
the
sermon
would
be
their
ruin
yet
if
the
king
grace
heard
of
it
there
was
a
fellow
that
went
out
through
he
cried
in
panic
how
do
we
know
whether
he
is
not
talking
with
his
grace
even
now
i
will
not
have
such
sermons
and
you
shall
be
my
witnesses
that
i
said
so
the
monks
eyed
one
another
miserably
how
could
they
prosper
under
such
a
prior
as
this
but
worse
was
to
follow
though
it
did
not
directly
affect
this
house
the
bill
so
long
threatened
dissolving
the
smaller
houses
was
passed
in
february
by
a
parliament
carefully
packed
to
carry
out
the
wishes
and
from
which
the
spiritual
peers
were
excluded
by
his
permission
to
them
to
absent
themselves
lewes
priory
of
course
exceeded
the
limit
of
revenue
under
which
other
houses
were
suppressed
and
even
received
one
monk
who
had
obtained
permission
to
go
there
when
his
community
fell
but
in
spite
of
the
apparent
encouragement
from
the
preamble
of
the
bill
which
stated
that
in
the
great
solemn
monasteries
religion
was
right
well
kept
it
was
felt
that
this
act
was
but
the
herald
of
another
which
should
make
an
end
of
religious
houses
altogether
but
there
was
a
breath
of
better
news
later
on
when
tidings
came
in
the
early
summer
that
anne
was
in
disgrace
it
was
well
known
that
it
was
her
influence
that
egged
the
king
on
and
that
there
was
none
so
fierce
against
the
old
ways
was
it
not
possible
that
henry
might
even
yet
repent
himself
if
she
were
out
of
the
way
then
the
tidings
were
confirmed
and
for
a
while
there
was
hope
sir
nicholas
maxwell
rode
over
to
see
chris
and
was
admitted
into
one
of
the
parlours
to
talk
with
him
he
seemed
furiously
excited
and
hardly
saluted
his
chris
he
said
i
have
come
straight
from
london
with
great
news
the
king
harlot
is
fallen
chris
stared
dead
he
said
dead
in
a
day
or
two
thank
god
he
spat
furiously
god
strike
her
he
cried
she
has
wrought
all
the
mischief
i
believe
they
told
me
so
a
year
back
but
i
did
not
believe
it
and
where
is
she
then
nicholas
told
his
story
his
ruddy
comely
face
bright
with
exultation
for
he
had
no
room
for
pity
left
the
rumours
that
had
come
to
lewes
were
true
anne
had
been
arrested
suddenly
at
greenwich
during
the
sports
and
had
been
sent
straight
to
the
tower
the
king
was
weary
of
her
though
she
had
borne
him
a
child
and
did
not
scruple
to
bring
the
most
odious
charges
against
her
she
had
denied
and
denied
but
it
was
useless
she
had
wept
and
laughed
in
prison
and
called
on
god
to
vindicate
her
but
the
process
went
on
none
the
less
the
marriage
had
been
declared
null
and
void
by
cranmer
who
had
blessed
it
and
now
she
was
condemned
for
sinning
against
it
but
she
is
either
his
wife
said
chris
amazed
or
else
she
is
not
guilty
of
adultery
nicholas
chuckled
god
save
us
chris
do
you
think
henry
ca
manage
it
then
he
grew
white
with
passion
and
beat
the
table
and
damned
the
king
and
anne
and
cranmer
to
hell
together
chris
glanced
up
drumming
his
fingers
softly
on
the
table
nick
he
said
there
is
no
use
in
that
when
is
she
to
die
the
knight
face
flushed
again
with
pleasure
and
he
showed
his
teeth
set
together
two
days
he
said
please
god
or
three
at
the
most
and
she
will
not
meet
those
she
has
sent
before
her
or
john
fisher
whose
head
she
had
brought
to
her
the
bloody
herodias
pray
god
that
she
will
said
chris
softly
they
will
pray
for
her
at
least
pah
shouted
nicholas
an
eye
for
an
eye
for
me
chris
said
nothing
he
was
thinking
of
all
that
this
might
mean
who
could
know
what
might
not
happen
nicholas
broke
in
again
presently
i
heard
a
fine
tale
he
said
do
you
know
that
the
woman
is
in
the
very
room
where
she
slept
the
night
before
the
crowning
last
time
it
was
for
the
crown
to
be
put
on
now
it
is
for
the
head
to
be
taken
off
and
it
is
true
that
she
weeps
and
laughs
they
can
hear
her
laugh
two
storeys
away
i
hear
nick
said
chris
suddenly
i
am
weary
of
that
let
her
alone
pray
god
she
may
turn
nicholas
stared
astonished
and
a
little
awed
too
chris
used
not
to
be
like
this
he
seemed
quieter
and
stronger
he
had
never
dared
to
speak
so
before
yes
i
am
weary
of
this
said
chris
again
i
stormed
once
at
ralph
and
gained
nothing
we
do
not
win
by
those
weapons
where
is
ralph
nicholas
knit
his
lips
to
keep
in
the
fury
that
urged
him
he
is
with
cromwell
still
he
said
venomously
and
very
busy
i
hear
they
will
be
making
him
a
lord
soon
but
there
will
be
no
lady
chris
had
heard
of
beatrice
rejection
of
ralph
he
is
still
busy
why
yes
he
worked
long
at
this
bill
i
hear
chris
asked
a
few
more
questions
and
learned
that
ralph
seemed
fiercer
than
ever
since
the
visitation
he
was
at
court
had
been
seen
riding
with
the
king
and
it
was
supposed
that
he
was
rising
rapidly
in
favour
every
day
god
help
him
sighed
chris
the
change
that
had
come
over
chris
was
very
much
marked
neither
a
life
in
the
world
would
have
done
it
nor
one
in
the
peace
of
the
cloister
but
an
alternation
of
the
two
he
had
been
melted
by
the
fire
of
the
inner
life
and
braced
by
the
external
bitterness
of
adversity
visit
to
the
priory
culminating
in
the
passionless
salutation
of
him
in
the
cloister
as
being
a
guest
and
therefore
a
representative
of
christ
had
ended
that
stage
in
the
development
of
the
monk
character
chris
was
disappointed
in
his
brother
fearful
for
him
and
stern
in
his
attitude
towards
him
but
he
was
not
resentful
he
was
sincere
when
he
prayed
god
to
help
him
when
nicholas
had
eaten
and
gone
carrying
messages
to
mary
chris
told
the
others
and
there
was
a
revival
of
hope
in
the
house
then
a
few
days
later
came
the
news
of
anne
death
and
of
the
marriage
of
the
king
with
jane
seymour
on
the
following
day
at
least
jane
was
a
lawful
wife
and
queen
in
the
catholics
eyes
for
katharine
too
was
dead
chris
had
now
passed
through
the
minor
orders
the
and
the
diaconate
and
was
looking
forward
to
priesthood
it
had
been
thought
advisable
by
his
superiors
in
view
of
the
troubled
state
of
the
times
to
apply
for
the
necessary
dispensations
and
they
had
been
granted
without
difficulty
so
many
monks
who
were
not
priests
had
been
turned
into
the
world
resourceless
since
they
could
not
be
appointed
to
benefices
that
it
was
thought
only
fair
to
one
who
was
already
bound
by
vows
of
religion
and
sacred
orders
not
to
hold
him
back
from
an
opportunity
to
make
his
living
should
affairs
be
pushed
further
in
the
direction
of
dissolution
he
was
looking
forward
with
an
extraordinary
zeal
to
the
crown
of
priesthood
it
seemed
to
him
a
possession
that
would
compensate
for
all
other
losses
if
he
could
but
make
the
body
of
the
lord
lift
it
before
the
throne
and
hold
it
in
his
hands
all
else
was
trifling
there
were
waves
of
ecstatic
peace
again
breaking
over
his
soul
as
he
thought
of
it
as
he
moved
behind
the
celebrant
at
high
mass
lifted
the
pall
of
the
chalice
and
sang
the
exultant
missa
when
all
was
done
what
a
power
would
be
his
on
that
day
he
would
have
his
finger
then
on
the
huge
engine
of
grace
and
could
turn
it
whither
he
would
spraying
infinite
force
on
this
and
that
soul
on
ralph
stubbornly
fighting
against
god
in
london
on
his
mother
silent
and
bitter
at
home
on
his
father
anxious
and
courageous
waiting
for
disaster
on
margaret
trembling
in
rusper
nunnery
as
she
contemplated
the
defiance
she
had
flung
in
the
king
face
the
prior
had
given
him
but
little
encouragement
he
had
sent
for
him
one
day
and
told
him
that
he
might
prepare
himself
for
priesthood
by
michaelmas
for
a
foreign
bishop
was
coming
to
them
and
leave
would
be
obtained
for
him
to
administer
the
rite
but
he
had
not
said
a
word
of
counsel
or
congratulation
but
had
nodded
to
the
young
monk
and
turned
his
sickly
face
to
the
papers
again
on
his
table
dom
anthony
the
pleasant
stout
who
had
preached
the
sermon
in
christmastide
said
a
word
of
comfort
as
they
walked
in
the
cloister
together
you
must
not
take
it
amiss
brother
he
said
my
lord
prior
is
beside
himself
with
terror
he
does
not
know
how
to
act
chris
asked
whether
there
were
any
new
reason
for
alarm
oh
no
said
the
monk
but
the
people
are
getting
cold
towards
us
here
you
have
seen
how
few
come
to
mass
here
now
or
to
confession
they
are
going
to
the
secular
priests
instead
chris
remembered
one
or
two
other
instances
of
this
growing
coldness
the
poor
folks
who
came
for
food
complained
of
its
quality
two
or
three
times
and
one
fellow
an
old
pensioner
of
the
house
who
had
lost
a
leg
threw
his
portion
down
on
the
doorstep
i
will
have
better
than
that
some
day
he
had
said
as
he
limped
off
chris
had
gathered
up
the
cold
lentils
patiently
and
carried
them
back
to
the
kitchen
on
another
day
a
farmer
had
flatly
refused
a
favour
to
the
monk
who
superintended
the
i
will
not
have
your
beasts
in
my
orchard
he
had
said
roughly
you
are
not
my
masters
the
congregations
too
were
visibly
declining
as
the
had
said
the
great
nave
beyond
the
screen
looked
desolate
in
the
as
the
sunlight
lay
in
coloured
patches
on
the
wide
empty
pavement
between
the
few
faithful
gathered
in
front
and
the
half
dozen
loungers
who
leaned
in
the
shadow
of
the
west
wall
men
who
fulfilled
their
obligation
of
hearing
mass
with
a
determination
to
do
so
with
the
least
inconvenience
to
themselves
and
who
scuffled
out
before
the
blessing
it
was
evident
that
the
tide
of
faith
and
reverence
was
beginning
to
ebb
even
in
the
quiet
country
towns
as
the
summer
drew
on
the
wider
world
too
had
its
storms
a
fierce
sermon
was
preached
at
the
opening
of
convocation
by
latimer
now
bishop
of
worcester
at
the
express
desire
of
the
archbishop
that
scourged
not
only
the
regular
but
the
secular
clergy
as
well
the
sermon
too
was
more
furiously
protestant
than
any
previously
preached
on
such
an
occasion
pilgrimages
the
stipends
for
masses
and
the
use
of
an
unknown
tongue
in
divine
service
were
alike
denounced
as
contrary
to
the
pure
gospel
the
phrases
of
luther
were
abundantly
used
in
the
discourse
and
it
was
evident
from
the
fact
that
no
public
censure
fell
upon
the
preacher
that
henry
own
religious
views
had
developed
since
the
day
that
he
had
published
his
attack
on
the
foreign
reformers
the
proceedings
of
convocation
confirmed
the
suspicion
that
the
sermon
aroused
with
an
astonishing
compliance
the
clergy
first
ratified
the
decree
of
nullity
in
the
matter
of
anne
marriage
with
the
king
disclaimed
obedience
to
rome
and
presented
a
list
of
matters
for
which
they
requested
reform
in
answer
to
this
last
point
the
king
assisted
by
a
couple
of
bishops
sent
down
to
the
houses
a
month
later
a
paper
of
articles
to
which
the
clergy
instantly
agreed
these
articles
proceeded
in
the
direction
of
protestantism
through
omission
rather
than
affirmation
baptism
penance
and
the
sacrament
of
the
altar
were
spoken
of
in
catholic
terms
the
other
four
sacraments
were
omitted
altogether
on
the
other
hand
again
devotion
to
saints
and
prayers
for
the
departed
were
enjoined
with
important
qualifications
finally
it
was
agreed
to
support
the
king
in
his
refusal
to
be
represented
at
the
proposed
general
council
at
mantua
the
tidings
of
all
this
filtering
in
to
the
house
at
lewes
by
priests
and
religious
who
stayed
there
from
time
to
time
did
not
tend
to
reassure
those
who
looked
for
peace
the
assault
was
not
going
to
stop
at
matters
of
discipline
it
was
dogma
that
was
aimed
at
and
worse
even
than
that
the
foundation
on
which
dogma
rested
it
was
not
an
affair
of
religious
houses
or
even
of
morality
there
was
concerned
the
very
rock
itself
on
which
christendom
based
all
faith
and
morals
if
it
was
once
admitted
that
a
national
church
apart
from
the
see
of
rome
could
in
the
smallest
degree
adjudicate
on
a
point
of
doctrine
the
unity
of
the
catholic
church
as
understood
by
every
monk
in
the
house
was
immediately
ruptured
again
and
again
in
chapter
there
were
terrible
scenes
the
prior
raved
weakly
crying
that
it
was
not
the
part
of
a
good
catholic
to
resist
his
prince
that
the
apostle
himself
enjoined
obedience
to
those
in
authority
that
the
new
light
of
learning
had
illuminated
perplexing
problems
and
that
in
the
uncertainty
it
was
safer
to
follow
the
certain
duty
of
civil
obedience
dom
anthony
answered
that
a
greater
than
paul
had
bidden
his
followers
to
render
to
god
the
things
that
were
god
that
peter
was
crucified
sooner
than
obey
nero
and
the
prior
cried
out
for
silence
and
that
he
could
not
hear
his
christian
king
likened
to
the
heathen
emperor
monk
after
monk
would
rise
one
following
his
prior
and
disclaiming
personal
learning
and
responsibility
another
with
ironic
deference
saying
that
a
man
soul
was
his
own
and
that
not
even
a
religious
superior
could
release
from
the
biddings
of
conscience
another
would
balance
himself
between
the
parties
declaring
that
the
distinction
of
duties
was
insoluble
that
in
such
a
case
as
this
it
was
impossible
to
know
what
was
due
to
god
and
what
to
man
yet
another
voice
would
rise
from
time
to
time
declaring
that
the
tales
that
they
heard
were
incredible
that
it
was
impossible
that
the
king
should
intend
such
evil
against
the
church
he
still
heard
his
three
masses
a
day
as
he
had
always
done
there
was
no
more
ardent
defender
of
the
sacrament
of
the
altar
chris
used
to
steady
himself
in
this
storm
of
words
as
well
as
he
could
by
reflecting
that
he
probably
would
not
have
to
make
a
decision
for
it
would
be
done
for
him
at
least
as
regarded
his
life
in
the
convent
or
out
by
his
superiors
or
again
he
would
fix
his
mind
resolutely
on
his
approaching
priesthood
while
the
prior
sat
gnawing
his
lips
playing
with
his
cross
and
rapping
his
foot
before
bursting
out
again
and
bidding
them
all
be
silent
for
they
knew
not
what
they
were
meddling
with
the
misery
rose
to
its
climax
when
the
injunctions
arrived
and
the
chapter
sat
far
into
the
morning
meeting
again
after
dinner
to
consider
them
these
were
directions
issued
to
the
clergy
throughout
the
country
by
the
authority
of
the
king
alone
and
this
very
fact
was
significant
of
what
the
royal
supremacy
meant
some
of
them
did
not
touch
the
religious
and
were
intended
only
for
but
others
were
bitterly
hard
to
receive
the
community
was
informed
that
in
future
once
in
every
quarter
a
sermon
was
to
be
preached
against
the
bishop
of
rome
usurped
power
the
ten
articles
previously
issued
were
to
be
brought
before
the
notice
of
the
congregation
and
careful
instructions
were
to
be
given
as
regards
superstition
in
the
matter
of
praying
to
the
saints
it
was
the
first
of
these
that
caused
the
most
strife
dom
anthony
who
was
becoming
more
and
more
the
leader
of
the
conservative
party
pointed
out
that
the
see
of
peter
was
to
every
catholic
the
root
of
authority
and
unity
and
that
christianity
itself
was
imperilled
if
this
rock
were
touched
the
prior
angrily
retorted
that
it
was
not
the
holy
see
that
was
to
be
assaulted
but
the
erection
falsely
raised
upon
it
it
was
the
abuse
of
power
not
the
use
of
it
that
had
to
be
denounced
dom
anthony
requested
the
prior
to
inform
him
where
the
line
of
distinction
lay
and
the
prior
in
answer
burst
into
angry
explanations
instancing
the
pecuniary
demands
of
the
pope
the
appointment
of
foreigners
to
english
benefices
and
all
the
rest
of
the
accusations
that
were
playing
such
a
part
now
in
the
religious
controversy
of
the
country
dom
anthony
replied
that
those
were
not
the
matters
principally
aimed
at
by
the
injunction
it
concerned
rather
the
whole
constitution
of
christ
church
and
was
a
question
of
the
pope
or
the
supremacy
over
that
part
of
it
that
lay
in
england
finally
the
debate
was
ended
by
the
prior
declaration
that
he
could
trust
no
one
to
preach
the
enjoined
sermon
but
himself
and
that
he
would
see
to
it
on
his
own
responsibility
it
was
scarcely
an
inspiring
atmosphere
for
one
who
was
preparing
to
take
on
him
the
burden
of
priesthood
in
the
catholic
church
chapter
ii
sacerdos
in
aeternum
it
was
a
day
of
wonderful
autumn
peace
when
chris
first
sang
mass
in
the
presence
of
the
community
the
previous
day
he
had
received
priesthood
from
the
hands
of
the
little
old
french
bishop
in
the
priory
church
one
by
one
strange
mystical
ceremonies
had
been
performed
the
stole
had
been
shifted
and
crossed
on
the
breast
the
token
of
christ
yoke
the
chasuble
had
been
placed
over
his
head
looped
behind
then
the
rolling
cry
to
the
spirit
of
god
who
alone
seals
to
salvation
and
office
had
pealed
round
the
high
roof
and
down
the
long
nave
that
stretched
away
westwards
in
sunlit
gloom
while
across
the
outstretched
hands
of
the
monk
had
been
streaked
the
sacred
oil
giving
him
the
power
to
bless
the
things
of
god
the
hands
were
bound
up
as
if
to
heal
the
indelible
wound
of
love
that
had
been
inflicted
on
them
and
before
they
were
unbound
into
the
hampered
fingers
were
slid
the
sacred
vessels
of
the
altar
occupied
now
by
the
elements
of
bread
and
wine
while
the
awful
power
to
offer
sacrifice
for
the
quick
and
the
dead
was
committed
to
him
in
one
tremendous
phrase
then
the
mass
went
on
and
the
new
priest
kneeling
with
dom
anthony
at
a
little
bench
set
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
steps
repeated
aloud
with
the
bishop
the
words
of
the
liturgy
from
the
great
painted
missal
lying
before
him
how
strange
it
had
been
too
when
all
was
over
he
stood
by
a
pillar
in
the
nave
beneath
pancras
image
while
all
came
to
receive
his
blessing
first
the
prior
pale
and
sullen
as
always
now
then
the
community
some
smiling
and
looking
into
his
eyes
before
they
knelt
some
perfunctory
some
solemn
and
sedate
with
downcast
faces
each
kissed
the
fragrant
hands
and
stood
aside
while
the
laity
came
up
and
first
among
them
his
father
and
mary
his
place
too
in
the
refectory
had
a
flower
or
two
laid
beside
it
and
the
day
had
gone
by
in
a
bewildering
dream
he
had
walked
with
his
father
and
sister
a
little
and
had
found
himself
smiling
and
silent
in
their
company
in
the
evening
he
had
once
more
gone
through
the
ceremonies
of
mass
dom
anthony
stood
by
and
watched
and
reminded
and
criticised
and
now
the
morning
was
come
and
he
stood
at
the
altar
the
little
wind
had
dropped
last
night
and
the
hills
round
lewes
stood
in
mellow
sunlight
the
atmosphere
was
full
of
light
and
warmth
that
tender
glow
that
falls
on
autumn
days
the
trees
in
the
court
outside
stood
poised
on
the
brink
of
sleep
with
a
yellow
pallor
tinging
their
leaves
the
thousand
pigeons
exulted
and
wheeled
in
the
intoxicating
air
the
shadowy
church
was
alight
with
sunshine
that
streamed
through
the
clerestory
windows
on
to
the
heavy
pillars
the
unevenly
paved
floor
and
crept
down
the
recumbent
figures
of
noble
and
bishop
from
head
to
foot
there
were
a
few
people
present
beyond
the
screen
sir
james
and
his
daughter
in
front
watching
with
a
tender
reverence
the
harvesting
of
the
new
priest
as
he
prepared
to
gather
under
his
hands
the
mystical
wheat
and
grapes
of
god
chris
was
perfectly
practised
in
his
ceremonies
and
there
was
no
anxiety
to
dissipate
the
overpowering
awe
that
lay
on
his
soul
he
felt
at
once
natural
and
unreal
it
was
supremely
natural
that
he
should
be
here
he
could
not
conceive
being
other
than
a
priest
there
was
in
him
a
sense
of
a
relaxed
rather
than
an
intensified
strain
and
yet
the
whole
matter
was
strange
and
intangible
as
he
felt
the
supernatural
forces
gathering
round
and
surging
through
his
soul
he
was
aware
of
a
dusky
sunlit
space
about
him
of
the
glimmer
of
the
high
candles
and
nearer
of
the
white
cloth
the
shining
vessels
the
gorgeous
missal
and
the
rustle
of
the
ministers
vestments
but
the
whole
was
shot
with
an
inner
life
each
detail
was
significant
and
sacramental
and
he
wondered
sometimes
at
the
inaudible
vibration
that
stirred
the
silent
air
round
him
as
he
spoke
the
familiar
words
to
which
he
had
listened
so
often
he
kept
his
eyes
resolutely
down
as
he
turned
from
time
to
time
spreading
his
hands
to
the
people
and
was
only
partly
conscious
of
the
faces
watching
him
from
the
dark
stalls
in
front
and
the
sunlit
nave
beyond
even
the
sacred
ministers
dom
anthony
and
another
seemed
to
be
little
more
than
crimson
impersonal
figures
that
moved
and
went
about
their
stately
business
with
deft
and
gracious
hands
as
he
began
to
penetrate
more
nearly
to
the
heart
of
the
mystery
and
the
angels
song
before
the
throne
rolled
up
from
the
choir
there
was
an
experience
of
a
yet
further
retirement
from
the
things
of
sense
even
the
glittering
halpas
and
the
gleams
of
light
above
it
where
the
five
chapels
branched
behind
even
these
things
became
shrouded
there
was
just
a
sheet
of
white
beneath
him
the
glow
of
a
chalice
and
the
pale
disc
of
the
sacrificial
bread
then
as
he
paused
with
hands
together
famularumque
tuarum
there
opened
out
the
world
where
his
spirit
was
bending
its
intention
figure
after
figure
came
up
and
passed
before
his
closed
eyes
and
on
each
he
turned
the
beam
of
god
grace
first
ralph
sneering
and
aloof
in
his
rich
dress
intent
on
some
satanic
business
chris
seized
as
it
were
the
power
of
god
and
enveloped
and
penetrated
him
with
it
then
margaret
waiting
terrified
on
the
divine
will
his
mother
in
her
complacent
bitterness
mary
his
father
and
as
he
thought
of
him
it
seemed
as
if
all
god
blessings
were
not
too
great
nicholas
his
own
brethren
in
religion
his
prior
contracted
and
paralysed
with
terror
dom
anthony
with
his
pathetic
geniality
ah
how
short
was
the
time
and
yet
so
long
that
the
prior
looked
up
sharply
and
the
deacon
shifted
in
his
rustling
silk
then
again
the
hands
opened
and
the
stately
flood
of
petition
poured
on
as
through
open
gates
to
the
boundless
sea
that
awaited
it
where
the
very
heart
of
god
was
to
absorb
it
into
itself
the
great
names
began
to
flit
past
like
palaces
on
a
their
bases
washed
by
the
pouring
liturgy
peter
and
paul
simon
and
thaddeus
cosmas
and
damian
vast
pleasure
houses
alight
with
god
while
near
at
hand
now
gleamed
the
line
of
the
infinite
ocean
the
hands
came
together
arched
in
blessing
and
it
marked
the
first
sting
of
the
healing
water
as
the
divine
essence
pushed
forward
to
meet
man
need
hanc
igitur
oblationem
then
followed
the
swift
silent
signs
as
if
the
pilot
were
ordering
sails
out
to
meet
the
breeze
the
muttering
voice
sank
to
a
deliberate
whisper
the
ripples
ceased
to
leap
as
the
river
widened
and
chris
was
delicately
fingering
the
white
linen
before
taking
the
host
into
his
hands
there
was
a
swift
glance
up
as
to
the
great
sun
that
burned
overhead
one
more
noiseless
sign
and
he
sank
forward
in
unutterable
awe
with
his
arms
on
the
altar
and
the
white
disc
hovering
on
the
brink
of
beneath
his
eyes
the
faintest
whisper
rose
from
behind
as
the
people
shifted
their
constrained
attitudes
sir
james
glanced
up
his
eyes
full
of
tears
at
the
distant
crimson
figure
beneath
the
steady
row
of
lights
motionless
with
outspread
hands
poised
over
the
bosom
of
god
love
the
first
murmured
words
broke
the
silence
as
if
next
to
the
infinite
pity
rose
up
the
infinite
need
of
man
quoque
and
sank
to
silence
again
then
loud
and
clear
rang
out
omnia
saecula
saeculorum
and
the
choir
of
monks
sang
so
the
great
mystery
moved
on
but
upborne
now
by
the
very
presence
itself
that
sustained
all
things
from
the
limitless
sea
of
mercy
the
children
cried
through
the
priest
lips
to
their
father
who
was
in
heaven
and
entreated
the
lamb
of
god
who
takes
away
sin
to
have
mercy
on
them
and
give
them
peace
then
from
far
beyond
the
screen
mary
could
see
how
the
priest
leaning
a
little
forward
towards
that
which
he
bore
in
his
hands
looked
on
what
he
bore
in
them
and
she
whispered
softly
with
him
the
words
that
he
was
speaking
in
aeternum
sanctissima
caro
again
she
hid
her
face
and
when
she
raised
it
once
all
was
over
and
the
lord
had
entered
and
sanctified
the
body
and
soul
of
the
man
at
whose
words
he
had
entered
the
creature
of
bread
the
father
and
daughter
stood
together
silently
in
the
sunshine
outside
the
west
end
of
the
church
waiting
for
chris
he
had
promised
to
come
to
them
there
for
a
moment
when
his
thanksgiving
was
done
beyond
the
wall
and
the
where
the
visitors
had
lived
those
two
disastrous
days
rose
up
the
far
sunlit
downs
shadowed
here
and
there
with
hollows
standing
like
the
walls
about
jerusalem
as
they
turned
on
the
right
above
the
red
roofs
of
the
town
rose
the
downs
again
vast
slopes
and
shoulders
over
which
chris
had
ridden
so
short
a
while
ago
bearded
and
brown
with
hunting
it
was
over
there
that
ralph
had
come
through
that
dip
which
seemed
against
the
skyline
a
breach
in
a
high
wall
ah
surely
god
would
spare
this
place
so
stately
and
quiet
so
graciously
sheltered
by
the
defences
that
he
himself
had
raised
if
all
england
tottered
and
fell
this
at
least
might
stand
this
vast
home
of
prayer
that
stirred
day
and
night
with
the
praises
of
the
eternal
and
the
petitions
of
the
mortal
this
glorious
house
where
a
priest
so
dear
to
them
had
brought
forth
from
his
mystical
paternity
the
very
son
of
god
the
door
opened
behind
them
and
chris
came
out
pale
and
smiling
with
a
little
monk
beside
him
his
eyes
lightened
as
he
saw
them
standing
there
but
he
turned
again
for
a
moment
yes
father
he
said
what
was
it
you
stayed
too
long
said
the
other
at
the
the
rubric
says
nimis
you
know
yes
said
chris
chapter
iii
the
northern
rising
a
few
of
the
smaller
religious
houses
had
surrendered
themselves
to
the
king
before
the
passing
of
the
bill
in
the
early
spring
and
the
rest
of
them
were
gradually
yielded
up
after
its
enactment
during
the
summer
of
the
same
year
and
among
them
was
rusper
chris
heard
that
his
sister
margaret
had
returned
to
overfield
and
would
stay
there
for
the
present
throughout
the
whole
of
england
there
were
the
same
scenes
to
be
witnessed
a
troop
of
men
headed
by
a
commissioner
would
ride
up
one
evening
to
some
village
where
a
little
convent
stood
demand
entrance
at
the
gate
pass
through
and
disappear
from
the
eyes
of
the
watching
crowd
then
the
next
day
the
work
would
begin
the
lead
would
be
stripped
from
the
church
and
buildings
the
treasures
corded
in
bundles
the
woodwork
of
the
interior
put
up
to
auction
on
the
village
green
and
a
few
days
later
the
troop
would
disappear
again
heavily
laden
leaving
behind
roofless
walls
and
bewildered
religious
in
their
new
secular
dress
with
a
few
shillings
in
their
pockets
staring
after
the
rich
cavalcade
and
wondering
what
was
best
to
do
it
had
been
hoped
that
the
king
would
stay
his
hand
at
the
death
of
anne
and
even
yet
return
to
the
obedience
of
the
holy
see
the
pope
was
encouraged
to
think
so
by
the
authorities
on
the
continent
and
in
england
itself
there
prevailed
even
confidence
that
a
return
to
the
old
ways
would
be
effected
but
henry
had
gone
too
far
he
had
drunk
too
deeply
of
the
wealth
that
lay
waiting
for
him
in
the
treasuries
of
the
religious
houses
and
after
a
pause
of
expectation
he
set
his
hand
to
the
cup
again
it
was
but
natural
too
and
for
more
noble
motives
to
such
a
character
as
his
as
he
had
aimed
in
his
youth
at
nothing
less
than
supremacy
in
tennis
hunting
and
tourney
and
later
in
architecture
music
and
theological
reputation
as
for
the
same
reason
wolsey
had
fallen
when
the
king
looked
away
from
girls
and
sports
to
the
fiercer
game
of
politics
so
now
it
was
intolerable
to
henry
that
there
should
be
even
the
shadow
of
a
spiritual
independence
within
his
domain
a
glow
of
resentful
disappointment
swept
through
the
north
of
england
at
the
news
it
burst
out
into
flame
in
lincolnshire
and
was
not
finally
quenched
until
the
early
summer
of
the
following
year
the
news
that
reached
lewes
from
time
to
time
during
the
winter
and
spring
sent
the
hearts
of
all
that
heard
it
through
the
whole
gamut
of
emotions
at
one
time
fierce
hope
then
despair
then
rising
confidence
then
again
blank
hopelessness
each
in
turn
tore
the
souls
of
the
monks
and
misery
reached
its
climax
in
the
summer
at
the
news
of
the
execution
at
tyburn
of
the
abbots
of
jervaulx
and
fountains
with
other
monks
and
gentlemen
the
final
recital
of
the
whole
tragedy
was
delivered
to
them
at
the
mouth
of
a
religious
from
the
benedictine
cell
at
middlesborough
who
had
been
released
by
the
visitors
at
his
own
request
but
who
had
afterwards
repented
and
joined
the
rising
soon
after
the
outset
he
had
been
through
most
of
the
incidents
and
then
when
failure
was
assured
had
fled
south
in
terror
for
his
life
and
was
now
on
his
way
to
the
continent
to
take
up
his
monastic
vocation
once
more
the
prior
was
away
on
one
of
the
journeys
that
he
so
frequently
undertook
at
this
time
no
man
knew
whither
or
the
and
rebel
would
have
been
refused
admittance
but
the
was
persuaded
to
take
him
in
for
a
night
and
he
sat
long
in
one
of
the
parlours
that
evening
telling
his
story
chris
leaned
against
the
wall
and
watched
him
as
he
talked
with
the
on
his
face
he
was
a
stout
man
in
dress
for
he
was
not
yet
out
of
peril
he
sat
forward
in
his
chair
making
preacher
gestures
as
he
spoke
and
using
vivid
words
they
were
gathered
already
when
i
joined
them
on
their
way
to
york
there
were
nearly
ten
thousand
of
them
on
the
road
with
aske
at
their
head
i
have
never
set
eyes
on
such
a
company
there
was
a
troop
of
gentlemen
and
their
sons
riding
with
aske
in
front
all
in
armour
and
then
the
rabble
behind
with
gentlemen
again
to
their
officers
the
common
folk
had
pikes
and
hooks
only
and
some
were
in
leather
harness
and
some
without
but
they
marched
well
and
kept
good
order
they
were
of
all
sorts
hairy
men
and
boys
and
miners
from
the
north
there
were
monks
too
and
friars
i
know
not
how
many
that
went
with
the
army
to
encourage
them
and
everywhere
we
went
the
women
ran
out
of
their
homes
with
food
and
drink
and
prayed
god
to
bless
us
and
the
bells
were
rung
in
the
village
churches
we
slept
as
we
could
some
in
houses
some
in
churchyards
and
by
the
wayside
and
as
many
of
us
as
could
get
into
the
churches
heard
mass
each
day
as
many
too
as
could
make
them
wore
the
five
wounds
on
a
piece
of
stuff
sewn
on
the
arm
you
would
have
said
that
none
could
stand
against
us
so
eager
we
were
and
full
of
faith
there
was
a
song
was
there
not
began
one
of
the
monks
yes
father
we
sang
it
as
we
went
christ
crucified
for
thy
wounds
wide
us
commons
guide
which
pilgrims
be
through
god
his
grace
for
to
purchase
old
wealth
and
peace
of
the
spiritualty
you
could
hear
it
up
and
down
the
lines
sung
with
weeping
and
shouting
he
described
how
they
came
to
york
and
how
the
mayor
was
forced
to
admit
them
they
stayed
there
a
couple
of
days
and
aske
published
his
directions
for
all
the
ejected
religious
to
return
to
their
houses
i
went
to
a
little
cell
near
by
i
forget
its
name
to
help
some
canons
to
settle
in
again
whose
friendship
i
had
made
i
had
told
them
then
that
my
mind
was
to
enter
religion
once
more
and
they
took
me
very
willingly
we
got
there
at
night
the
roof
was
gone
from
the
dormitory
but
we
slept
there
for
all
that
such
of
us
as
could
sleep
for
i
heard
one
of
them
sobbing
for
joy
as
he
lay
there
in
his
old
corner
under
the
stars
and
we
sang
mass
in
the
morning
as
well
as
we
could
the
priest
had
an
old
tattered
vestment
that
hardly
hung
on
his
shoulders
and
there
was
no
cross
but
one
that
came
from
a
pair
of
beads
and
that
we
hung
over
the
altar
when
i
left
them
again
they
were
at
their
office
as
before
and
busy
roofing
the
house
with
old
timbers
for
my
lord
cromwell
had
all
the
lead
and
all
their
garden
was
trampled
but
they
said
they
would
do
very
well
the
were
their
good
friends
and
would
bring
them
what
they
needed
he
described
his
journey
to
doncaster
the
furious
excitement
of
the
villages
he
passed
through
and
the
news
that
reached
him
hour
after
hour
as
to
the
growing
vastness
of
aske
forces
there
were
thirty
thousand
i
heard
on
the
banks
of
the
don
on
one
side
for
my
lords
nevill
and
lumley
and
others
had
ridden
in
with
cuthbert
his
banner
and
arms
and
five
thousand
men
besides
those
that
came
in
from
all
the
country
and
on
the
further
side
was
my
lord
shrewsbury
for
the
king
with
the
duke
and
his
men
master
aske
had
all
he
could
do
to
keep
his
men
back
from
being
at
them
some
of
the
young
sparks
were
as
terriers
at
a
there
was
a
parley
held
on
the
bridge
for
norfolk
knew
well
that
he
must
gain
time
and
aske
sent
his
demands
to
his
grace
and
that
was
the
mistake
the
man
beat
one
hand
into
the
other
and
looked
round
with
a
kindling
force
that
was
the
mistake
he
was
too
loyal
for
such
work
and
did
not
guess
at
their
craft
well
while
we
waited
there
our
men
began
to
make
off
their
farms
were
wanting
them
and
their
wives
and
the
rest
and
we
melted
master
aske
had
to
be
everywhere
at
once
it
was
no
fault
of
his
my
lord
derby
was
marching
up
upon
the
houses
again
and
seeking
to
drive
the
monks
out
once
more
but
there
was
not
an
act
of
violence
done
by
our
men
not
a
taken
or
a
house
burned
they
were
peaceable
folk
and
asked
no
more
than
that
their
old
religion
should
be
given
back
to
them
and
that
they
might
worship
god
as
they
had
always
done
he
went
on
to
explain
how
the
time
had
been
wasted
in
those
fruitless
negotiations
and
how
the
force
dwindled
day
by
day
various
answers
were
attempted
by
the
king
containing
both
threats
and
promises
and
in
these
as
in
all
else
the
hand
of
cromwell
was
evident
finally
towards
the
end
of
november
the
insurgents
gathered
again
for
another
meeting
with
the
king
representatives
at
doncaster
summoned
by
beacons
on
the
top
of
the
high
yorkshire
moors
and
by
the
reversed
pealing
of
the
church
bells
we
had
a
parley
among
ourselves
at
pomfret
first
and
had
a
great
though
i
saw
little
of
it
and
drew
up
our
demands
and
then
set
out
for
doncaster
again
the
duke
was
there
with
the
king
pardon
in
his
hand
in
the
whitefriars
and
a
promise
that
all
should
be
as
we
asked
so
we
went
back
to
pomfret
and
the
next
day
on
thomas
hill
the
herald
read
the
pardon
to
us
all
and
we
poor
fools
thought
that
his
grace
meant
to
keep
his
word
the
monk
looked
bitterly
round
sneering
with
his
white
strong
teeth
set
together
like
a
savage
dog
and
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
the
looked
nervously
round
the
faces
of
his
subjects
for
this
was
treasonable
talk
to
hear
then
the
man
went
on
he
himself
it
seemed
had
retired
again
to
the
little
cell
where
he
had
seen
the
canons
settled
in
a
few
weeks
previously
and
heard
nothing
of
what
was
going
forward
except
that
the
heralds
were
going
about
the
country
publishing
the
king
pardon
to
all
who
had
taken
part
in
the
rebellion
and
affixing
it
to
the
in
each
town
and
village
with
touching
messages
from
the
king
relating
to
the
grief
which
he
had
felt
on
hearing
that
his
dear
children
believed
such
tales
about
him
little
by
little
however
the
discontent
began
to
smoulder
once
more
for
the
king
pledges
of
restoration
were
not
fulfilled
and
cromwell
who
was
now
recognised
to
be
the
inspirer
of
all
the
evil
done
against
religion
remained
as
high
as
ever
in
the
royal
favour
aske
who
had
been
to
the
king
in
person
and
given
him
an
account
of
all
that
had
taken
place
now
wrote
to
him
that
there
was
a
danger
of
a
further
rising
if
the
delay
continued
for
there
were
no
signs
yet
of
the
promised
free
parliament
being
called
at
york
then
again
disturbances
had
broken
out
i
was
at
hull
said
the
monk
with
sir
francis
bygod
in
january
but
we
did
nothing
and
only
lost
our
leader
and
all
the
while
norfolk
was
creeping
up
with
his
army
it
was
piteous
to
think
what
might
not
have
been
done
if
we
had
not
trusted
his
grace
but
was
no
good
and
i
was
back
again
in
the
dales
here
and
there
hiding
for
my
life
by
april
everywhere
was
the
same
the
monks
were
haled
out
again
from
their
houses
and
men
were
hanged
by
the
score
i
cut
down
four
myself
near
meux
and
gave
them
christian
burial
at
night
one
was
a
monk
and
hanged
in
his
habit
but
the
worst
of
all
was
at
york
the
man
face
twitched
with
emotion
and
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
mouth
once
or
twice
before
continuing
i
did
not
dare
to
go
into
the
court
for
fear
i
should
be
known
but
i
stood
outside
in
the
crowd
and
watched
them
go
in
there
was
a
fellow
riding
with
norfolk
a
false
knave
of
a
man
whom
we
had
all
learnt
to
hate
at
doncaster
for
he
was
always
jeering
at
us
secretly
and
making
mischief
when
he
could
i
saw
him
with
the
duke
before
when
we
went
into
the
whitefriars
for
the
pardon
and
he
stood
there
behind
with
the
look
of
a
devil
on
his
face
and
now
here
he
was
again
his
name
sir
put
in
dom
adrian
torridon
father
torridon
he
was
a
there
was
a
sharp
movement
in
the
room
so
that
the
monk
stopped
and
looked
round
him
amazed
chris
felt
the
blood
ebb
from
his
heart
and
din
in
his
ears
and
he
swayed
a
little
as
he
leaned
against
the
wall
he
saw
dom
anthony
lean
forward
and
whisper
to
the
stranger
and
through
the
haze
that
was
before
his
eyes
saw
the
other
look
at
him
sharply
with
a
fallen
jaw
then
the
monk
rose
and
made
a
little
stiff
inclination
to
chris
deferential
and
courteous
but
with
a
kind
of
determined
dignity
in
it
too
when
chris
had
recovered
himself
the
monk
was
deep
in
his
story
but
ralph
had
fallen
out
of
it
you
would
not
believe
it
he
was
saying
but
on
the
very
jury
that
was
to
try
master
aske
and
constable
there
were
empanelled
their
own
and
that
by
the
express
intention
of
norfolk
john
aske
was
one
of
them
and
some
others
who
had
to
wives
the
sons
of
my
lord
darcy
and
sir
robert
constable
you
see
how
it
would
be
if
the
prisoners
were
found
guilty
men
would
say
that
it
must
be
so
for
that
their
own
kin
had
condemned
them
and
if
they
were
to
be
acquitted
then
these
men
themselves
would
be
cast
there
again
broke
out
a
murmur
from
the
listening
faces
as
the
man
paused
well
they
were
cast
as
you
know
for
not
taking
the
king
to
be
the
supreme
head
of
the
church
and
for
endeavouring
to
force
the
king
to
hold
a
parliament
that
he
willed
not
and
i
was
at
york
again
when
master
aske
was
brought
back
from
london
to
be
hanged
and
i
saw
it
again
an
uncontrollable
emotion
shook
him
and
he
propped
his
face
on
his
hand
as
he
ended
his
tale
there
were
many
of
his
friends
there
in
the
crowd
and
scarcely
one
dared
to
cry
out
god
save
you
sir
i
dared
not
he
gave
one
rending
sob
and
chris
felt
his
eyes
prick
with
tears
at
the
sight
of
so
much
sorrow
it
was
piteous
to
see
a
brave
man
thinking
himself
a
coward
dom
anthony
leaned
forward
thank
you
father
he
said
though
his
voice
was
a
little
husky
and
thank
god
that
he
died
well
you
have
touched
all
our
hearts
i
was
a
hound
sobbed
the
man
a
hound
that
i
did
not
cry
out
to
him
and
tell
him
that
i
loved
him
no
no
father
said
the
other
tenderly
you
must
not
think
so
you
must
serve
god
well
now
and
pray
for
his
soul
the
bell
sounded
out
for
compline
as
he
spoke
and
the
monks
rose
you
will
come
into
choir
father
said
the
the
man
nodded
stood
up
and
followed
him
out
chris
was
in
a
strange
ferment
as
he
stood
in
his
stall
that
night
it
had
been
sad
enough
to
hear
of
that
gallant
attempt
to
win
back
the
old
liberties
and
the
old
faith
that
attempt
that
had
been
a
success
except
for
the
insurgents
trust
in
their
king
and
of
the
death
of
the
leaders
but
across
the
misery
had
pierced
a
more
poignant
grief
as
he
had
learnt
how
ralph
hand
was
in
this
too
and
had
taken
once
more
the
wrong
side
in
god
quarrel
but
still
he
had
no
resentment
the
conflict
had
passed
out
of
the
personal
plane
into
an
higher
and
he
thought
of
his
brother
as
god
enemy
rather
than
his
own
would
his
prayers
then
never
prevail
the
prayers
that
he
speeded
up
in
the
smoke
of
the
great
sacrifice
morning
by
morning
for
that
zealous
mistaken
soul
or
was
it
perhaps
that
that
brother
of
his
must
go
deeper
yet
before
coming
out
to
knowledge
and
pardon
chapter
iv
the
destruction
of
the
seal
the
autumn
drew
in
swiftly
the
wet
wind
blew
over
the
downs
that
lay
between
lewes
and
the
sea
and
beat
down
the
loose
browning
leaves
of
the
trees
about
the
priory
the
grass
in
the
grew
rank
and
dark
with
the
constant
rain
that
drove
and
dropped
over
the
high
roofs
and
meanwhile
the
tidings
grew
heavier
still
after
michaelmas
the
king
set
to
work
in
earnest
he
had
been
checked
by
the
northern
risings
and
still
paused
to
see
whether
the
embers
had
been
wholly
quenched
and
then
when
it
was
evident
that
the
north
was
as
submissive
as
the
south
began
again
his
business
of
gathering
in
the
wealth
that
was
waiting
he
started
first
in
the
north
under
show
of
inflicting
punishment
for
the
encouragement
that
the
religious
had
given
to
the
late
rebellions
and
one
by
one
the
great
abbeys
were
tottering
furness
and
sawley
had
already
fallen
with
jervaulx
and
the
other
houses
and
holme
cultram
was
placed
under
the
care
of
a
superior
who
could
be
trusted
to
hand
over
his
charge
when
called
upon
but
up
to
the
present
not
many
great
houses
had
actually
fallen
except
those
which
were
supposed
to
have
taken
a
share
in
the
revolt
and
owing
to
the
pains
taken
by
the
visitors
to
contradict
the
report
that
the
king
intended
to
lay
his
hands
on
the
whole
monastic
property
of
england
it
was
even
hoped
by
a
few
sanguine
souls
that
the
large
houses
might
yet
survive
there
were
hot
discussions
in
the
chapter
at
lewes
from
time
to
time
during
the
year
the
bishops
book
issued
by
a
committee
of
divines
and
approved
by
the
king
and
containing
a
digest
of
the
new
faith
that
was
being
promulgated
arrived
during
the
summer
and
was
fiercely
debated
but
so
high
ran
the
feeling
that
the
prior
dropped
the
matter
and
the
book
was
put
away
with
other
papers
of
the
kind
on
an
honourable
but
shelf
the
acrimony
in
domestic
affairs
began
to
reach
its
climax
in
october
when
the
prospects
of
the
priory
own
policy
came
up
for
discussion
some
maintained
that
they
were
safe
and
that
quietness
and
confidence
were
their
best
security
and
these
had
the
support
of
the
prior
others
declared
that
the
best
hope
lay
in
selling
the
possessions
of
the
house
at
a
low
price
to
some
trustworthy
man
who
would
undertake
to
sell
then
back
again
at
only
a
small
profit
to
himself
when
the
storm
was
passed
the
prior
rose
in
wrath
when
this
suggestion
was
made
would
you
have
me
betray
my
king
he
cried
i
tell
you
i
will
have
none
of
it
it
is
not
worthy
of
a
monk
to
have
such
thoughts
and
he
sat
down
and
would
hear
no
more
nor
speak
there
were
whispered
conferences
after
that
among
the
others
as
to
what
his
words
meant
surely
there
was
nothing
dishonourable
in
the
device
they
only
sought
to
save
what
was
their
own
and
how
would
the
king
be
betrayed
by
such
an
action
they
had
an
answer
a
fortnight
later
and
it
took
them
wholly
by
surprise
during
the
second
week
in
november
the
prior
had
held
himself
more
aloof
than
ever
only
three
or
four
of
the
monks
with
the
among
them
were
admitted
to
his
cell
and
they
were
there
at
all
hours
two
or
three
strangers
too
arrived
on
horseback
and
were
entertained
by
the
prior
in
a
private
parlour
and
then
on
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
the
explanation
came
when
the
usual
business
of
the
chapter
was
done
the
faults
confessed
and
penances
given
and
one
or
two
small
matters
settled
the
prior
instead
of
rising
to
give
the
signal
to
go
remained
in
his
chair
his
head
bent
on
to
his
hand
it
was
a
dark
morning
heavy
and
lowering
and
from
where
chris
sat
at
the
lower
end
of
the
great
chamber
he
could
scarcely
make
out
the
features
of
those
who
sat
under
the
high
window
at
the
east
but
as
soon
as
the
prior
lifted
his
face
and
spoke
he
knew
by
that
tense
strain
of
the
voice
that
something
impended
there
is
another
matter
said
the
prior
and
paused
again
for
a
moment
there
was
complete
silence
the
leant
a
little
forward
and
was
on
the
point
of
speaking
when
his
superior
lifted
his
head
again
and
straightened
himself
in
his
chair
it
is
this
he
said
and
his
voice
rang
hard
and
defiant
it
is
this
it
is
useless
to
think
we
can
save
ourselves
we
are
under
suspicion
and
worse
than
suspicion
i
have
hoped
and
prayed
and
striven
to
know
god
will
and
i
have
talked
with
my
lord
cromwell
not
once
or
twice
but
often
and
it
is
useless
to
resist
any
further
his
voice
cracked
with
misery
but
chris
saw
him
grip
the
bosses
of
his
in
an
effort
for
his
own
heart
began
to
sicken
this
was
not
frightened
raving
such
as
he
had
listened
to
before
it
was
the
speech
of
one
who
had
been
driven
into
decision
as
a
rat
into
a
corner
i
have
talked
with
the
and
others
and
they
think
with
me
in
this
i
have
kept
it
back
from
the
rest
that
they
might
serve
god
in
peace
so
long
as
was
possible
but
now
i
must
tell
you
all
my
sons
that
we
must
leave
this
place
there
was
a
hush
of
terrible
tension
the
monks
had
known
that
they
were
threatened
they
could
not
think
otherwise
with
the
news
that
came
from
all
parts
but
they
had
not
known
that
catastrophe
was
so
imminent
an
old
monk
opposite
chris
began
to
moan
and
mutter
but
the
prior
went
on
immediately
at
least
i
think
that
we
must
leave
it
may
be
otherwise
if
god
has
pity
on
us
i
do
not
know
but
we
must
be
ready
to
leave
if
it
be
his
will
and
and
to
say
so
he
was
speaking
in
abrupt
sentences
with
pauses
between
in
which
he
appeared
to
summon
his
resolution
to
speak
again
and
force
out
his
tale
there
was
plainly
more
behind
too
and
his
seemed
to
deepen
on
him
i
wish
no
one
to
speak
now
he
said
instead
of
the
we
shall
sing
mass
of
the
holy
ghost
and
afterwards
i
shall
have
more
to
say
to
you
again
i
do
not
desire
any
to
hold
speech
with
any
other
but
to
look
into
their
own
hearts
and
seek
counsel
of
god
there
he
still
sat
a
moment
silent
then
rose
and
gave
the
signal
it
was
a
strange
day
for
chris
he
did
not
know
what
to
think
but
he
was
certain
that
they
had
not
yet
been
told
all
the
prior
silences
had
been
as
pregnant
as
his
words
there
was
something
very
close
now
that
would
be
revealed
immediately
and
meanwhile
he
must
think
out
how
to
meet
it
the
atmosphere
seemed
charged
all
day
the
very
buildings
wore
a
strange
air
unfamiliar
and
menacing
the
intimate
bond
between
his
soul
and
them
knit
by
associations
of
prayer
and
effort
appeared
unreal
and
flimsy
he
was
tormented
by
doubtfulness
he
could
not
understand
on
the
one
side
how
it
was
possible
to
yield
to
the
king
on
the
other
how
it
was
possible
to
resist
no
final
decision
could
be
made
by
him
until
he
had
heard
the
minds
of
his
fellows
and
fortunately
they
would
all
speak
before
him
he
busied
himself
then
with
disentangling
the
strands
of
motive
desire
fear
and
hope
and
waited
for
the
shaking
loose
of
the
knot
until
he
knew
more
mass
of
the
holy
ghost
was
sung
next
morning
by
the
prior
himself
in
red
vestments
and
chris
waited
with
expectant
awe
remembering
how
the
carthusians
under
like
circumstances
had
been
visited
by
god
but
the
host
was
uplifted
and
the
bell
rang
and
there
was
nothing
but
the
gloom
of
the
choir
about
the
altar
and
the
sigh
of
the
wind
in
the
chapels
behind
then
in
the
the
prior
told
them
all
he
reminded
them
how
they
had
prayed
that
morning
for
guidance
and
that
they
must
be
fearless
now
in
following
it
out
it
was
easy
to
be
reckless
and
call
it
faith
but
prudence
and
reasonable
were
attributes
of
the
christian
no
less
than
trust
in
god
they
had
not
to
consider
now
what
they
would
wish
for
themselves
but
what
god
intended
for
them
so
far
as
they
could
read
it
in
the
signs
of
the
times
for
myself
he
cried
and
chris
almost
thought
him
sincere
as
he
spoke
so
kindled
was
his
face
for
myself
i
should
ask
no
more
than
to
live
and
die
in
this
place
as
i
had
hoped
every
stone
here
is
as
dear
to
me
as
to
you
and
i
think
more
dear
for
i
have
been
in
a
special
sense
the
lord
of
it
all
but
i
dare
not
think
of
that
we
must
be
ready
to
leave
all
willingly
if
god
wills
we
thought
that
we
had
yielded
all
to
follow
christ
when
we
first
set
our
necks
here
under
his
sweet
yoke
but
i
think
he
asks
of
us
even
more
now
and
that
we
should
go
out
from
here
even
as
we
went
out
from
our
homes
ten
or
twenty
years
ago
we
shall
be
no
further
from
our
god
outside
this
place
and
we
may
be
even
nearer
if
we
go
out
according
to
his
will
he
seemed
on
fire
with
zeal
and
truth
his
timid
peevish
air
was
gone
and
his
delicate
scholarly
face
was
flushed
as
he
spoke
chris
was
astonished
and
more
perplexed
than
ever
was
it
then
possible
that
god
will
might
lie
in
the
direction
he
feared
now
this
is
the
matter
which
we
have
to
consider
went
on
the
prior
more
quietly
his
grace
has
sent
to
ask
through
a
private
messenger
from
my
lord
cromwell
whether
we
will
yield
up
the
priory
there
is
no
compulsion
in
the
matter
he
paused
significantly
and
his
grace
desires
each
to
act
according
to
his
judgment
and
conscience
of
of
his
own
free
will
there
was
a
dead
silence
the
news
was
almost
expected
by
now
through
the
months
of
anxiety
each
monk
had
faced
the
probability
of
such
tidings
coming
to
him
sooner
or
later
and
the
last
few
days
had
brought
expectation
to
its
climax
yet
it
was
hard
to
see
the
enemy
face
to
face
and
to
know
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
resisting
him
finally
the
rose
to
his
feet
and
began
to
speak
glancing
as
if
for
corroboration
to
his
superior
from
time
to
time
his
mouth
worked
a
little
at
the
close
of
each
sentence
my
lord
prior
has
shown
us
his
own
mind
and
i
am
with
him
in
the
matter
his
grace
treats
us
like
his
own
children
he
wishes
us
to
be
loving
and
obedient
but
as
a
father
too
he
has
authority
behind
to
compel
us
to
his
will
if
we
will
not
submit
and
as
my
lord
prior
said
yesterday
we
do
not
know
whether
or
no
his
grace
will
not
permit
us
to
remain
here
after
all
if
we
are
docile
or
perhaps
refound
the
priory
out
of
his
own
bounty
there
is
talk
of
the
chertsey
monks
going
to
the
london
charterhouse
from
bisham
where
the
king
set
them
last
year
but
we
may
be
sure
he
will
not
do
so
with
us
if
we
resist
his
will
now
i
on
my
part
then
am
in
favour
of
yielding
up
the
house
willingly
and
trusting
ourselves
to
his
grace
clemency
there
was
again
silence
as
he
sat
down
and
a
pause
of
a
minute
or
two
before
dom
anthony
rose
his
ruddy
face
was
troubled
and
perplexed
but
he
spoke
resolutely
enough
he
said
that
he
could
not
understand
why
the
matter
had
not
been
laid
before
them
earlier
that
they
might
have
had
time
to
consider
it
the
question
was
an
extremely
difficult
one
to
the
consciences
of
some
of
them
on
the
one
hand
there
was
the
peril
of
acquiescing
in
sacrilege
the
prior
twisted
in
his
seat
as
he
heard
this
and
on
the
other
of
wilfully
and
petulantly
throwing
away
their
only
opportunity
of
saving
their
priory
he
asked
for
time
several
more
made
speeches
some
in
favour
of
the
proposal
and
some
asking
as
dom
anthony
had
done
for
further
time
for
consideration
they
had
no
precedents
they
said
on
which
to
decide
such
a
question
for
they
understood
that
it
was
not
on
account
of
treason
that
they
were
required
to
surrender
the
house
and
property
the
prior
rose
with
a
white
face
no
no
he
cried
god
forbid
that
is
over
and
done
with
i
we
have
made
our
peace
with
my
lord
cromwell
in
that
affair
then
why
asked
dom
anthony
are
we
required
to
yield
it
the
prior
glanced
helplessly
at
him
i
it
is
as
a
sign
that
the
king
is
temporal
lord
of
the
land
we
do
not
deny
that
said
the
other
some
do
said
the
prior
feebly
there
was
a
little
more
discussion
dom
anthony
remarked
that
it
was
not
a
matter
of
temporal
but
spiritual
headship
that
was
in
question
to
meddle
with
the
religious
orders
was
to
meddle
with
the
vicar
of
christ
under
whose
special
protection
they
were
and
it
seemed
to
him
at
least
a
probable
opinion
so
far
as
he
had
had
time
to
consider
it
that
to
yield
even
in
the
hopes
of
saving
their
property
ultimately
was
to
acquiesce
in
the
repudiation
of
the
authority
of
rome
and
so
it
went
on
for
an
hour
and
then
as
it
grew
late
the
prior
rose
once
more
and
asked
if
any
one
had
a
word
to
say
who
had
not
yet
spoken
chris
had
intended
to
speak
but
all
that
he
wished
to
ask
had
already
been
stated
by
others
and
he
sat
now
silent
staring
up
at
the
prior
and
down
at
the
smooth
boarded
floor
at
his
feet
he
had
not
an
idea
what
to
do
he
was
no
theologian
then
the
prior
unmasked
his
last
gun
as
regards
the
matter
of
time
for
consideration
that
is
now
passed
in
spite
of
what
some
have
said
we
have
had
sufficient
warning
all
here
must
have
known
that
the
choice
would
be
laid
before
them
for
months
past
it
is
now
an
answer
that
is
required
of
us
he
paused
a
moment
longer
his
lips
began
to
tremble
but
he
made
a
strong
effort
and
finished
master
petre
will
be
here
as
my
lord
representative
and
will
sit
in
the
to
receive
the
surrender
dom
anthony
started
to
his
feet
the
prior
made
a
violent
gesture
for
silence
and
then
gave
the
signal
to
break
up
again
the
bewildering
day
went
past
the
very
discipline
of
the
house
was
a
weakness
in
the
defence
of
the
surprised
party
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
meet
and
discuss
the
situation
as
they
wished
and
even
the
small
times
of
leisure
seemed
unusually
occupied
dom
anthony
was
busy
at
the
one
of
the
others
who
had
spoken
against
the
proposal
was
sent
off
on
a
message
by
the
prior
and
another
was
ordered
to
assist
the
sacristan
to
clean
the
treasures
in
view
of
the
coming
chris
was
not
able
to
ask
a
word
of
advice
from
any
of
those
whom
he
thought
to
be
in
sympathy
with
him
he
sat
all
day
over
his
antiphonary
in
the
little
carrel
off
the
cloister
and
as
he
worked
his
mind
toiled
like
a
mill
he
had
progressed
a
long
way
with
the
work
now
and
was
engaged
on
the
pages
that
contained
the
antiphons
for
lent
the
design
was
soberer
here
the
angels
that
had
rested
among
the
green
branches
and
early
roses
of
septuagesima
thrusting
here
a
trumpet
and
there
a
harp
among
the
leaves
had
taken
flight
and
grave
menacing
creatures
were
in
their
place
a
jackal
looked
from
behind
the
leafless
trunk
a
lion
lifted
his
toothed
mouth
to
roar
from
a
thicket
of
thorns
as
they
had
lurked
and
bellowed
in
the
bleak
wilderness
above
the
jordan
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
they
were
gravely
significant
now
he
thought
and
scarcely
knowing
what
he
did
he
set
narrow
human
eyes
in
the
lion
face
for
he
knew
no
better
and
broadened
the
hanging
jaws
with
a
delicate
line
or
two
then
with
a
fierce
impulse
he
crowned
him
and
surmounted
the
crown
with
a
cross
and
all
the
while
his
mind
toiled
at
the
problem
there
were
three
things
open
to
him
on
the
morrow
either
he
might
refuse
to
sign
the
surrender
and
take
whatever
consequences
might
follow
or
he
might
sign
it
and
there
were
two
processes
of
thought
by
which
he
might
take
that
action
by
the
first
he
would
simply
make
an
act
of
faith
in
his
superiors
and
do
what
they
did
because
they
did
it
by
the
second
he
would
sign
it
of
his
own
responsibility
because
he
decided
to
think
that
by
doing
so
he
would
be
taking
the
best
action
for
securing
his
own
monastic
life
he
considered
these
three
to
refuse
to
sign
almost
inevitably
involved
his
ruin
and
that
not
only
and
not
necessarily
in
the
worldly
sense
about
that
he
sincerely
believed
he
did
not
care
but
it
would
mean
his
exclusion
from
any
concession
that
the
king
might
afterwards
make
he
certainly
would
not
be
allowed
under
any
circumstances
to
remain
in
the
home
of
his
profession
and
if
the
community
was
shifted
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
go
with
them
as
regards
the
second
alternative
he
wondered
whether
it
was
possible
to
shift
responsibility
in
that
manner
as
regards
the
third
he
knew
that
he
had
very
little
capability
in
any
case
of
foreseeing
the
course
that
events
would
take
then
he
turned
it
all
over
again
and
considered
the
arguments
for
each
course
his
superiors
were
set
over
him
by
god
it
was
rash
to
set
himself
against
them
except
in
matters
of
the
plainest
conscience
again
it
was
cowardly
to
shelter
himself
behind
this
plea
and
so
avoid
responsibility
lastly
he
was
bound
to
judge
for
himself
the
arguments
twisted
and
turned
as
bewilderingly
as
the
twining
branches
of
his
design
and
behind
each
by
which
he
might
climb
to
decision
lurked
a
beast
he
felt
helpless
and
dazed
by
the
storm
of
conflicting
motives
as
he
bent
over
his
work
he
prayed
for
light
but
the
question
seemed
more
tangled
than
before
the
hours
were
creeping
in
by
he
must
decide
then
the
memory
of
the
prior
advice
to
him
once
before
came
back
to
his
mind
this
was
the
kind
of
thing
he
told
himself
that
he
must
leave
to
god
his
own
judgment
was
too
coarse
an
instrument
he
must
wait
for
a
clear
supernatural
impulse
and
as
he
thought
of
it
he
laid
his
pencil
down
dropped
on
to
his
knees
and
commended
it
all
to
god
to
the
mother
of
god
pancras
peter
and
paul
even
as
he
did
it
the
burden
lifted
and
he
knew
that
he
would
know
when
the
time
came
petre
came
that
night
but
chris
saw
no
more
of
him
than
his
back
as
he
went
up
the
cloister
with
dom
anthony
to
the
prior
chamber
the
prior
was
not
at
supper
and
his
seat
was
empty
in
the
dim
refectory
neither
was
he
at
compline
and
it
was
with
the
knowledge
that
cromwell
man
and
their
own
superior
were
together
in
conference
that
the
monks
went
up
the
dormitory
stairs
that
night
but
he
was
in
his
place
at
the
next
morning
though
he
spoke
to
no
one
and
disappeared
immediately
afterwards
then
at
the
appointed
time
the
monks
assembled
in
the
as
chris
came
in
he
lifted
his
eyes
and
saw
that
the
room
was
arrayed
much
as
it
had
been
at
the
visit
of
layton
and
ralph
a
great
table
heaped
with
books
and
papers
stood
at
the
upper
end
immediately
below
the
dais
and
a
couple
of
secretaries
were
there
men
seated
at
either
end
and
busy
with
documents
the
prior
was
in
his
place
in
the
shadow
and
was
leaning
over
and
talking
to
a
man
who
sat
beside
him
chris
could
make
out
little
of
the
latter
except
that
he
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
lawyer
or
clerk
and
was
dressed
in
a
dark
gown
and
cap
he
was
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
book
as
the
prior
talked
and
nodded
his
head
assentingly
from
time
to
time
when
all
the
monks
were
seated
there
was
still
a
pause
it
was
strangely
unlike
the
scene
of
a
tragedy
there
in
that
dark
grave
room
with
the
quiet
faces
downcast
round
the
walls
and
the
hands
hidden
in
the
and
even
on
the
deeper
plane
it
all
seemed
very
correct
and
legal
there
was
the
representative
of
the
king
a
capable
learned
man
with
all
the
indications
of
law
and
order
round
him
and
his
two
secretaries
to
endorse
or
check
his
actions
there
too
was
the
community
gathered
to
do
business
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
the
rule
with
the
deeds
of
foundation
before
their
eyes
and
the
great
brass
convent
seal
on
the
table
there
was
not
a
hint
of
bullying
or
compulsion
these
monks
were
asked
merely
to
sign
a
paper
if
they
so
desired
it
each
was
to
act
for
himself
there
was
to
be
no
of
individual
privileges
or
signing
away
another
conscience
nothing
could
have
been
arranged
more
peaceably
and
yet
to
every
man
mind
that
was
present
the
sedate
room
was
black
with
horror
the
majesty
and
terror
of
the
king
will
brooded
in
the
air
nameless
dangers
looked
in
at
the
high
windows
and
into
every
face
the
quiet
men
were
ministers
of
fearful
vengeance
the
very
pens
ink
and
paper
that
lay
there
so
innocently
were
sacraments
of
death
or
life
the
prior
ceased
his
whispering
presently
glanced
round
to
see
if
all
were
in
their
places
and
then
stood
up
his
voice
was
perfectly
natural
as
he
told
them
that
this
was
petre
come
down
from
lord
cromwell
to
offer
them
an
opportunity
of
showing
their
trust
and
love
towards
their
king
by
surrendering
to
his
discretion
the
buildings
and
property
that
they
held
no
man
was
to
be
compelled
to
sign
it
must
be
perfectly
voluntary
on
their
part
his
grace
wished
to
force
no
conscience
to
do
that
which
it
repudiated
for
his
own
part
he
said
he
was
going
to
sign
with
a
glad
heart
the
king
had
shown
his
clemency
in
a
hundred
ways
and
to
that
clemency
he
trusted
then
he
sat
down
and
chris
marvelled
at
his
petre
stood
up
and
looked
round
for
a
moment
before
opening
his
mouth
then
he
put
his
two
hands
on
the
table
before
him
dropped
his
eyes
and
began
his
speech
he
endorsed
first
what
the
prior
had
said
and
congratulated
all
there
on
possessing
such
a
superior
it
was
a
great
happiness
he
said
to
deal
with
men
who
showed
themselves
so
reasonable
and
so
loyal
some
he
had
had
to
do
with
had
not
been
so
and
and
of
course
their
stubbornness
had
brought
its
own
penalty
but
of
that
he
did
not
wish
to
speak
on
the
other
hand
those
who
had
shown
themselves
true
subjects
of
his
grace
had
already
found
their
reward
he
had
great
pleasure
in
announcing
to
them
that
what
the
prior
had
said
to
them
a
day
or
two
before
was
true
and
that
their
brethren
in
religion
of
chertsey
abbey
who
had
been
moved
to
bisham
last
year
were
to
go
to
the
london
charterhouse
in
less
than
a
month
the
papers
were
made
out
he
had
assisted
in
their
drawing
up
he
spoke
in
a
quiet
restrained
voice
and
with
an
appearance
of
great
deference
there
was
not
the
shadow
of
a
bluster
even
when
he
referred
to
the
penalties
of
stubbornness
it
was
very
unlike
the
hot
bullying
arrogance
of
layton
then
he
ended
and
so
reverend
fathers
the
choice
is
in
your
hands
his
grace
will
use
no
compulsion
you
will
hear
presently
that
the
terms
of
surrender
are
explicit
in
that
point
he
will
not
force
one
man
to
sign
who
is
not
convinced
that
he
can
best
serve
his
king
and
himself
by
doing
so
it
would
go
sorely
against
his
heart
if
he
thought
that
he
had
been
the
means
of
making
the
lowest
of
his
subjects
to
act
contrary
to
the
conscience
that
god
has
given
him
my
lord
prior
i
will
beg
of
you
to
read
the
terms
of
surrender
the
paper
was
read
and
it
was
as
it
had
been
described
again
and
again
it
was
repeated
in
various
phrases
that
the
property
was
yielded
of
it
was
impossible
to
find
in
it
even
the
hint
of
a
threat
the
properties
in
question
were
enumerated
in
the
minutest
manner
and
the
list
included
all
the
rights
of
the
priory
over
the
cluniac
cell
of
castleacre
the
prior
laid
the
paper
down
and
looked
at
petre
the
commissioner
rose
from
his
seat
taking
the
paper
as
he
did
so
and
so
stood
a
moment
you
see
reverend
fathers
that
it
is
as
i
told
you
i
understand
that
you
have
already
considered
the
matter
so
that
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
he
stepped
down
from
the
dais
and
passed
round
to
the
further
side
of
the
table
one
of
the
secretaries
pushed
an
and
a
couple
of
quills
across
to
him
my
lord
prior
said
petre
with
a
slight
bow
if
you
are
willing
to
sign
this
i
will
beg
of
you
to
do
so
and
after
that
to
call
up
your
subjects
he
laid
the
paper
down
the
prior
stepped
briskly
out
of
his
seat
and
passed
round
the
table
chris
watched
his
back
the
thin
lawyer
beside
him
indicating
the
place
for
the
name
and
listened
as
in
a
dream
to
the
scratching
of
the
pen
he
himself
still
did
not
know
what
he
would
do
if
all
signed
the
prior
stepped
back
and
chris
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
white
face
that
smiled
terribly
the
stepped
down
at
a
sign
from
his
superior
and
then
one
by
one
the
monks
came
out
chris
heart
sickened
as
he
watched
and
then
stood
still
on
a
sudden
in
desperate
hope
for
opposite
to
him
dom
anthony
sat
steady
his
head
on
his
hand
and
made
no
movement
when
it
was
his
turn
to
come
out
chris
saw
the
prior
look
at
the
monk
and
a
spasm
of
emotion
went
over
his
face
dom
anthony
he
said
the
monk
lifted
his
face
and
it
was
smiling
too
i
can
not
sign
my
lord
prior
then
the
veils
fell
and
decision
flashed
on
chris
soul
he
heard
the
pulse
drumming
in
his
ears
and
his
wet
hands
slipped
one
in
the
other
as
he
gripped
them
together
but
he
made
no
sign
till
all
the
others
had
gone
up
then
he
looked
up
at
the
prior
it
seemed
an
eternity
before
the
prior
looked
at
him
and
nodded
and
he
could
make
no
answering
sign
then
he
heard
his
name
called
and
with
a
great
effort
he
answered
his
voice
seemed
not
his
own
in
his
ears
he
repeated
dom
anthony
words
i
can
not
sign
my
lord
prior
then
he
sat
back
with
closed
eyes
and
waited
he
heard
movements
about
him
steps
the
crackle
of
parchment
and
at
last
petre
voice
but
he
scarcely
understood
what
was
said
there
was
but
one
thought
dinning
in
his
brain
and
that
was
that
he
had
refused
and
thrown
his
defiance
down
before
the
king
that
terrible
man
whom
he
had
seen
in
his
barge
on
the
river
with
the
narrow
eyes
the
pursed
mouth
and
the
great
jowl
as
he
sat
by
the
woman
he
called
his
wife
that
woman
who
now
chris
shivered
opened
his
eyes
and
sense
came
back
petre
was
just
ending
his
speech
he
was
congratulating
the
community
on
their
reasonableness
and
loyalty
by
an
overwhelming
majority
they
had
decided
to
trust
the
king
and
they
would
not
find
his
grace
unmindful
of
that
as
for
those
who
had
not
signed
he
could
say
nothing
but
that
they
had
used
the
liberty
that
his
grace
had
given
them
whether
they
had
used
it
rightly
was
no
business
of
his
then
he
turned
to
the
prior
the
seal
then
my
lord
prior
i
think
that
is
the
next
matter
the
prior
rose
and
lifted
it
from
the
table
chris
caught
the
gleam
of
the
brass
and
silver
of
the
ponderous
precious
thing
in
his
hand
the
symbol
of
their
corporate
existence
engraved
as
he
knew
with
the
four
patrons
of
the
house
the
cliff
the
running
water
of
the
ouse
and
the
rhyming
prayer
to
pancras
the
prior
handed
it
to
the
commissioner
who
took
it
and
stood
there
a
moment
weighing
it
in
his
hand
a
hammer
he
said
one
of
the
secretaries
rose
and
drew
from
beneath
the
table
a
sheet
of
metal
and
a
sharp
hammer
he
handed
both
to
petre
chris
watched
fascinated
with
something
very
like
terror
his
throat
contracted
in
a
sudden
spasm
as
he
saw
the
commissioner
place
the
metal
in
the
solid
table
before
him
and
then
holding
the
seal
sideways
lift
the
hammer
in
his
right
hand
then
blow
after
blow
began
to
echo
in
the
rafters
overhead
chapter
v
the
sinking
ship
petre
had
come
and
gone
and
to
all
appearance
the
priory
was
as
before
he
had
not
taken
a
jewel
or
a
fragment
of
stuff
he
had
congratulated
the
sacristan
on
the
beauty
and
order
of
his
treasures
and
had
bidden
him
guard
them
carefully
for
that
there
were
knaves
abroad
who
professed
themselves
as
authorised
by
the
king
to
seize
monastic
possessions
which
they
sold
for
their
own
profit
the
offices
continued
to
be
sung
day
and
night
and
the
masses
every
morning
and
the
poor
were
fed
regularly
at
the
gate
but
across
the
corporate
life
had
passed
a
subtle
change
analogous
to
that
which
comes
to
the
body
of
a
man
legal
death
had
taken
place
already
the
unity
of
life
and
consciousness
existed
no
more
the
seal
was
defaced
they
could
no
longer
sign
a
document
except
as
individuals
now
the
would
set
in
little
by
little
until
somatic
death
too
had
been
consummated
and
the
units
which
had
made
up
the
organism
had
ceased
to
bear
any
relation
one
to
the
other
but
until
after
christmas
there
was
no
further
development
and
the
feast
was
observed
as
usual
and
with
the
full
complement
of
monks
at
the
midnight
mass
there
was
a
larger
congregation
than
for
many
months
and
the
confessions
and
communions
also
slightly
increased
it
was
a
symptom
as
chris
very
plainly
perceived
of
the
manner
in
which
the
shadow
of
the
king
reached
even
to
the
remotest
details
of
the
life
of
the
country
the
priory
was
now
as
it
were
enveloped
in
the
royal
protection
and
the
people
responded
accordingly
there
had
come
no
hint
from
headquarters
as
to
the
ultimate
fate
of
the
house
and
some
even
began
to
hope
that
the
of
a
would
be
fulfilled
neither
had
any
mark
of
disapproval
arrived
as
to
the
refusal
to
sign
on
the
part
of
the
two
monks
but
although
nothing
further
was
said
in
conversation
or
at
chapter
there
was
a
consciousness
in
the
minds
of
both
dom
anthony
and
chris
that
a
wall
had
arisen
between
them
and
the
rest
talk
in
the
cloister
was
apt
to
flag
when
either
approached
and
the
prior
never
spoke
a
word
to
them
beyond
what
was
absolutely
necessary
then
about
the
middle
of
january
the
last
process
began
to
be
enacted
one
morning
the
prior
place
in
church
was
empty
he
was
accustomed
to
disappear
silently
and
no
astonishment
was
caused
on
this
occasion
but
at
compline
the
same
night
the
too
was
gone
this
was
an
state
of
things
but
all
except
the
and
chris
seemed
to
take
it
as
a
matter
of
course
and
no
word
was
spoken
after
the
chapter
on
the
next
morning
dom
anthony
made
a
sign
to
chris
as
he
passed
him
in
the
cloister
and
the
two
went
out
together
into
the
clear
of
the
outer
court
dom
anthony
glanced
behind
him
to
see
that
no
one
was
following
and
then
turned
to
the
other
they
are
both
gone
he
said
and
others
are
going
dom
bernard
is
getting
his
things
together
i
saw
them
under
his
bed
last
night
chris
stared
at
him
mute
and
terrified
what
are
we
to
do
dom
anthony
we
can
do
nothing
we
must
stay
remember
that
we
are
the
only
two
who
have
any
rights
here
now
before
god
there
was
silence
a
moment
chris
glanced
at
the
other
and
was
reassured
by
the
steady
look
on
his
ruddy
face
i
will
stay
dom
anthony
he
said
softly
the
other
looked
at
him
tenderly
god
bless
you
brother
he
said
that
night
dom
bernard
and
another
were
gone
and
still
the
others
made
no
sign
or
comment
and
it
was
not
until
yet
another
pair
had
gone
that
dom
anthony
spoke
plainly
he
was
now
the
senior
monk
in
the
house
and
it
was
his
place
to
direct
the
business
of
the
chapter
when
the
formal
proceedings
were
over
he
stood
up
fearlessly
you
can
not
hide
it
longer
he
said
i
have
known
for
some
while
what
was
impending
he
glanced
round
at
the
empty
stalls
and
his
face
flushed
with
sudden
anger
for
god
sake
get
you
gone
you
who
mean
to
go
and
let
us
who
are
steadfast
serve
our
lord
in
peace
chris
looked
along
the
few
faces
that
were
left
but
they
were
downcast
and
sedate
and
showed
no
sign
of
emotion
dom
anthony
waited
a
moment
longer
and
then
gave
the
signal
to
depart
by
a
week
later
the
two
were
left
alone
it
was
very
strange
to
be
there
in
the
vast
house
and
church
and
to
live
the
old
life
now
stripped
of
of
its
meaning
but
they
did
not
allow
one
detail
to
suffer
that
it
was
possible
to
preserve
the
was
punctually
done
and
god
was
served
in
psalmody
at
the
proper
hours
the
two
priests
met
in
the
cloister
cowled
and
in
their
and
walked
through
to
the
empty
stalls
and
there
one
on
either
side
each
answered
the
other
bowed
together
at
the
confessed
and
absolved
alternately
two
masses
were
said
each
day
in
the
huge
lonely
church
one
at
the
high
altar
and
the
other
at
our
lady
and
each
monk
served
the
other
in
the
refectory
one
read
from
the
pulpit
as
the
other
sat
at
the
table
and
the
usual
forms
were
observed
with
the
minutest
care
in
the
chapter
each
morning
they
met
for
mutual
confession
and
accusation
and
in
the
times
between
the
exercises
and
meals
each
worked
feverishly
at
the
details
that
alone
made
the
life
possible
they
were
assisted
in
this
by
two
paid
servants
who
were
sent
to
them
by
chris
father
for
both
the
and
the
servants
had
gone
with
the
rest
and
the
treasurer
had
disappeared
with
the
money
chris
had
written
to
sir
james
the
day
that
the
last
monk
had
gone
telling
him
the
state
of
affairs
and
how
the
larder
was
almost
empty
and
by
the
next
evening
the
servants
had
arrived
with
money
and
provisions
and
a
letter
from
sir
james
written
from
a
saying
that
he
was
unable
to
come
for
the
present
for
he
had
taken
the
fever
and
that
morris
would
not
leave
him
but
expressing
a
hope
that
he
would
come
soon
in
person
and
that
morris
should
be
sent
in
a
few
days
the
latter
ended
with
passionate
approval
of
his
son
action
god
bless
and
reward
you
dear
lad
he
had
written
i
can
not
tell
you
the
joy
that
it
is
to
my
heart
to
know
that
you
are
faithful
it
can
not
be
for
long
but
whether
it
is
for
long
and
short
you
shall
have
my
prayers
and
blessings
and
please
god
my
poor
presence
too
after
a
few
days
may
our
lady
and
your
holy
patron
intercede
for
you
both
who
are
so
worthy
of
their
protection
at
the
end
of
the
second
week
in
march
morris
arrived
chris
was
taking
the
air
in
the
court
shortly
before
sunset
after
a
hard
day
work
in
church
the
land
was
beginning
to
stir
with
the
of
spring
and
the
hills
set
round
the
town
had
that
faint
flush
of
indescribable
colour
that
tinges
slopes
of
grass
as
the
sleeping
sap
begins
to
stir
the
in
the
court
were
hazy
with
growth
as
the
buds
fattened
at
the
end
of
every
twig
and
a
group
of
daffodils
here
and
there
were
beginning
to
burst
their
sheaths
of
gold
there
on
the
little
lawn
before
the
were
half
a
dozen
white
and
lavender
patches
of
colour
that
showed
where
the
crocuses
would
star
the
grass
presently
and
from
the
high
west
front
of
the
immense
church
and
from
beneath
the
eaves
of
the
offices
to
the
right
the
birds
were
practising
the
snatches
of
song
that
would
break
out
with
full
melody
a
month
or
two
later
in
spite
of
all
that
threatened
chris
was
in
an
ecstasy
of
happiness
it
rushed
down
on
him
overwhelmed
and
enveloped
him
for
he
knew
now
that
he
had
been
faithful
the
flood
of
praise
in
the
church
had
dwindled
to
a
thread
but
it
was
still
the
though
it
flowed
but
from
two
hearts
and
the
pulse
of
the
heavenly
sacrifice
still
throbbed
morning
by
morning
and
the
divine
presence
still
burned
as
unceasingly
as
the
lamp
that
beaconed
it
in
the
church
that
was
now
all
but
empty
of
its
ministers
there
were
times
when
the
joy
that
was
in
his
heart
trembled
into
tears
as
when
last
night
he
and
his
friend
had
sung
the
song
to
mary
and
the
contrast
between
the
two
poor
voices
and
the
roar
of
petition
that
had
filled
the
great
vaulting
a
year
before
had
suddenly
torn
his
heart
in
two
but
now
the
poignant
sorrow
had
gone
again
and
as
he
walked
here
alone
on
this
march
evening
with
the
steady
hills
about
him
and
the
flushing
sky
overhead
and
the
sweet
life
quickening
in
the
grass
at
his
feet
an
extraordinary
peace
flooded
his
soul
there
came
a
knocking
at
the
gate
and
the
jangle
of
a
bell
and
he
went
across
quickly
and
unbarred
the
door
morris
was
there
on
horseback
a
couple
of
saddlebags
strapped
to
his
beast
and
a
little
group
of
loungers
stood
behind
chris
smiled
with
delight
and
threw
the
door
wide
the
servant
saluted
him
and
then
turned
to
the
group
behind
you
have
no
authority
he
said
as
to
my
going
in
then
he
rode
through
and
chris
barred
the
gate
behind
him
glancing
as
he
did
so
at
the
curious
faces
that
stared
silently
morris
said
nothing
till
he
had
led
his
horse
into
the
stable
then
he
explained
one
of
the
fellows
told
me
sir
that
this
was
the
king
house
now
and
that
i
had
no
business
here
chris
smiled
again
i
know
we
are
watched
he
said
the
servants
are
questioned
each
time
they
set
foot
outside
morris
pursed
his
lips
how
long
shall
you
be
here
sir
he
asked
until
we
are
turned
out
said
chris
it
was
true
as
he
had
said
that
the
house
was
watched
ever
since
the
last
monk
had
left
there
had
been
a
man
or
two
at
the
gate
another
outside
the
that
opened
towards
the
town
and
another
yet
again
beyond
the
stream
to
the
south
of
the
dom
anthony
had
told
him
what
it
meant
it
was
that
the
authorities
had
no
objection
to
the
two
monks
keeping
the
place
until
it
could
be
dealt
with
but
were
determined
that
nothing
should
pass
out
it
had
not
been
worthwhile
to
send
in
a
caretaker
for
all
the
valuables
had
been
removed
either
by
the
visitors
or
by
the
prior
when
he
went
at
night
there
were
only
two
sets
of
altar
vessels
left
and
a
few
other
comparatively
worthless
utensils
for
the
use
of
the
church
and
kitchen
the
great
relics
and
the
jewelled
treasures
had
gone
long
before
chris
had
wondered
a
little
at
the
house
being
disregarded
for
so
long
but
the
other
monk
had
reminded
him
that
such
things
as
lead
and
brass
and
bells
were
beyond
the
power
of
two
men
to
move
and
could
keep
very
well
until
other
more
pressing
business
had
been
despatched
elsewhere
morris
gave
him
news
of
his
father
it
had
not
been
the
true
fever
after
all
and
he
would
soon
be
here
in
at
any
rate
a
week
or
two
as
regarded
other
news
there
was
no
tidings
of
ralph
except
that
he
was
very
busy
mistress
margaret
was
at
home
no
notice
seemed
to
have
been
taken
of
her
when
she
had
been
turned
out
with
the
rest
at
the
dissolution
of
her
convent
it
was
very
pleasant
to
see
that
familiar
face
about
the
cloister
and
refectory
or
now
and
again
when
work
was
done
looking
up
from
beyond
the
screen
as
the
monks
came
in
by
the
sacristy
door
once
or
twice
on
dark
evenings
when
terror
began
to
push
through
the
rampart
of
the
will
that
chris
had
raised
up
it
was
reassuring
too
to
know
that
morris
was
there
for
he
bore
with
him
as
old
servants
do
an
atmosphere
of
home
and
security
and
he
carried
himself
as
well
with
a
wonderful
naturalness
as
if
the
relief
of
beleaguered
monks
were
as
ordinary
a
duty
as
the
cleaning
of
plate
march
was
half
over
now
and
still
no
sign
had
come
from
the
world
outside
there
were
no
guests
either
to
bring
tidings
for
the
priory
was
a
marked
place
and
it
was
well
not
to
show
or
receive
kindliness
in
its
regard
within
the
tension
of
nerves
grew
acute
chris
was
conscious
of
a
deepening
exaltation
but
it
was
backed
by
horror
he
found
himself
now
smiling
with
an
irrepressible
internal
joy
now
twitching
with
apprehension
starting
at
sudden
noises
and
terrified
at
loneliness
dom
anthony
too
grew
graver
still
and
would
take
his
arm
sometimes
and
walk
with
him
and
tell
him
tales
and
watch
him
with
tender
eyes
but
in
him
as
in
the
younger
monk
the
strain
tightened
every
day
they
were
singing
compline
together
one
evening
with
tired
overstrained
voices
for
they
had
determined
not
to
relax
any
of
the
chant
until
it
was
necessary
morris
was
behind
them
at
a
chair
set
beyond
the
screen
and
there
were
no
others
present
in
church
the
choir
was
perfectly
dark
for
they
knew
the
office
by
heart
except
for
a
glimmer
from
the
sacristy
door
where
a
lamp
burned
within
to
light
them
to
bed
chris
thoughts
had
fled
back
to
that
summer
evening
long
ago
when
he
had
knelt
far
down
in
the
nave
and
watched
the
serried
line
of
the
soldiers
of
god
and
listened
to
the
tramp
of
the
psalmody
and
longed
to
be
of
their
company
now
the
gallant
regiment
had
dwindled
to
two
of
which
he
was
one
and
the
that
had
received
him
and
encouraged
him
the
other
dom
anthony
was
the
officiant
this
evening
and
had
just
sung
lustily
out
in
the
dark
that
god
was
about
them
with
his
shield
that
they
need
fear
no
nightly
terror
the
movement
flagged
for
a
moment
for
chris
was
not
attending
morris
voice
began
alone
sagitta
and
then
stopped
abruptly
as
he
realised
that
he
was
singing
by
himself
and
simultaneously
came
a
sharp
little
crash
from
the
dark
altar
that
rose
up
in
the
gloom
in
front
a
sort
of
sobbing
breath
broke
from
chris
at
the
sudden
noise
and
he
gripped
his
hands
together
in
a
moment
dom
anthony
had
taken
up
the
verse
sagitta
from
the
arrow
that
flieth
by
day
from
the
thing
that
walketh
in
darkness
chris
recovered
himself
and
the
office
passed
on
as
the
two
passed
out
together
towards
the
door
dom
anthony
went
forward
up
the
steps
and
chris
waited
and
watched
him
stoop
and
pass
his
hands
over
the
floor
then
he
straightened
himself
came
down
the
steps
and
went
before
chris
into
the
sacristy
under
the
lamp
he
stopped
and
lifted
what
he
carried
to
the
light
it
was
the
little
ivory
crucifix
that
he
had
hung
there
a
few
weeks
ago
when
the
last
cross
of
precious
metal
had
disappeared
with
the
it
was
cracked
across
the
body
of
the
figure
now
and
one
of
the
arms
was
detached
at
the
shoulder
and
swung
free
on
the
nail
through
the
hand
dom
anthony
looked
at
it
turned
and
looked
at
chris
and
without
a
word
the
two
passed
out
into
the
cloister
and
turned
up
the
dormitory
stairs
to
both
of
them
it
was
a
sign
that
the
end
was
at
hand
on
the
following
afternoon
morris
ran
in
to
chris
carrel
and
found
him
putting
the
antiphonary
and
his
implements
up
into
a
parcel
master
christopher
he
said
sir
james
and
sir
nicholas
are
come
as
he
hurried
out
of
the
cloister
he
saw
the
horses
standing
there
spent
with
fast
travelling
and
the
two
riders
at
their
heads
with
the
dust
on
their
boots
and
their
clothes
disordered
they
remained
motionless
as
the
monk
came
towards
them
but
he
saw
that
his
face
was
working
and
that
his
eyes
were
wide
and
anxious
thank
god
said
the
old
man
softly
i
am
in
time
they
are
coming
chris
but
there
was
a
questioning
look
on
his
face
chris
looked
at
him
will
you
take
the
horses
said
his
father
again
nick
and
i
are
safe
chris
still
stared
bewildered
then
he
understood
and
with
understanding
came
decision
no
father
he
said
the
old
man
face
broke
up
into
lines
of
emotion
are
you
sure
my
son
chris
nodded
steadily
then
we
will
all
be
together
said
sir
james
and
he
turned
to
lead
his
horse
to
the
stable
there
was
a
little
council
held
in
the
a
few
minutes
later
dom
anthony
hurried
to
it
his
habit
splashed
with
whitewash
for
he
had
been
cleaning
the
dormitory
and
the
four
sat
down
together
it
seemed
that
nicholas
had
ridden
over
from
great
keynes
to
overfield
earlier
in
the
afternoon
and
had
brought
the
news
that
a
company
of
men
had
passed
through
the
village
an
hour
before
and
that
one
of
them
had
asked
which
turn
to
take
to
lewes
sir
nicholas
had
ridden
after
them
and
enquired
their
business
and
had
gathered
that
they
were
bound
for
the
priory
and
he
then
turned
his
horse
and
made
off
to
overfield
his
horse
was
spent
when
he
arrived
there
but
he
had
changed
horses
and
came
on
immediately
with
sir
james
to
warn
the
monks
of
the
approach
of
the
men
and
to
give
them
an
opportunity
of
making
their
escape
if
they
thought
it
necessary
who
were
the
leaders
asked
the
elder
monk
nicholas
shook
his
head
they
were
in
front
i
dared
not
ride
up
but
his
sturdy
face
looked
troubled
as
he
answered
and
chris
saw
his
father
lips
tighten
dom
anthony
drummed
softly
on
the
table
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
he
said
we
wait
till
we
are
cast
out
you
can
not
refuse
admittance
questioned
sir
james
but
we
shall
do
so
said
the
other
tranquilly
at
least
we
shall
not
open
but
they
will
batter
the
door
down
certainly
said
the
monk
and
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
suppose
they
will
put
us
out
there
was
absolutely
nothing
to
be
done
it
was
absurd
to
dream
of
more
than
formal
resistance
up
in
the
north
in
more
than
one
abbey
the
inmates
had
armed
themselves
and
faced
the
spoilers
grimly
on
the
village
green
but
that
was
where
the
whole
country
side
was
with
them
and
here
it
was
otherwise
they
talked
a
few
minutes
longer
and
decided
that
they
would
neither
open
nor
resist
the
monks
two
were
determined
to
remain
there
until
they
were
actually
cast
out
and
then
the
responsibility
would
rest
on
other
shoulders
than
theirs
it
was
certain
of
course
that
by
this
time
at
the
latest
they
would
have
been
expelled
and
it
was
arranged
that
the
two
monks
should
ride
back
to
overfield
if
they
were
personally
unmolested
and
remain
there
until
further
plans
were
decided
upon
the
four
knew
of
course
that
there
was
a
grave
risk
in
provoking
the
authorities
any
further
but
it
was
a
risk
that
the
two
religious
were
determined
to
run
they
broke
up
presently
morris
came
upstairs
to
tell
them
that
food
was
ready
in
one
of
the
parlours
off
the
cloister
and
the
two
laymen
went
off
with
him
while
the
monks
went
to
sing
vespers
for
the
last
time
an
hour
or
two
later
the
two
were
in
the
refectory
at
supper
the
evening
was
drawing
in
and
the
light
in
the
tall
windows
was
fading
opposite
where
chris
sat
for
dom
anthony
was
reading
aloud
from
the
pulpit
a
row
of
coats
burned
in
the
glass
and
he
ran
his
eyes
over
them
they
had
been
set
there
he
remembered
soon
after
his
own
coming
to
the
place
the
records
had
been
searched
and
the
arms
of
every
prior
copied
and
emblazoned
in
the
panes
there
they
all
were
from
lanzo
of
five
centuries
ago
whose
arms
were
conjectural
down
to
robert
crowham
who
had
forsaken
his
trust
telling
the
long
tale
of
prelates
and
monastic
life
from
the
beginning
to
the
close
he
looked
round
beyond
the
circle
of
light
cast
by
his
own
candle
and
the
place
seemed
full
of
ghosts
and
presences
to
his
fancy
the
pale
oak
panelling
glimmered
along
the
walls
above
the
empty
seats
from
the
prior
to
the
left
over
which
the
dusky
fresco
of
the
majesty
of
christ
grew
darker
still
as
the
light
faded
down
to
the
pulpit
opposite
where
dom
grave
ruddy
face
with
downcast
eyes
stood
out
vivid
in
the
candlelight
ah
surely
there
was
a
cloud
of
witnesses
now
a
host
of
faces
looking
down
from
the
black
rafters
overhead
and
through
the
glimmering
panes
the
faces
of
those
who
had
eaten
here
with
the
same
sacramental
dignity
and
graciousness
that
these
two
survivors
used
it
was
impossible
to
feel
lonely
in
this
stately
house
saturated
with
holy
life
and
with
a
thrill
at
his
heart
he
remembered
how
dom
anthony
had
once
whispered
to
him
at
the
beginning
of
the
troubles
that
if
others
held
their
peace
the
very
stones
should
cry
out
and
that
god
was
able
of
those
stones
to
raise
up
children
to
his
praise
there
was
a
sound
of
brisk
hurrying
footsteps
in
the
cloister
outside
dom
anthony
ceased
his
reading
with
his
finger
on
the
place
and
the
eyes
of
the
two
monks
met
the
door
was
opened
abruptly
and
morris
stood
there
my
master
has
sent
me
sir
he
said
they
are
coming
chapter
vi
the
last
stand
the
court
outside
had
deepened
into
shadows
as
they
came
out
but
overhead
the
sky
still
glowed
faintly
luminous
in
a
tender
translucent
green
the
evening
star
shone
out
clear
and
tranquil
opposite
them
in
the
west
there
were
three
figures
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
that
led
down
from
the
cloister
one
of
the
servants
with
the
two
gentlemen
and
as
chris
pushed
forward
quickly
his
father
turned
and
lifted
his
finger
for
silence
the
town
lay
away
to
the
right
and
over
the
wall
that
joined
the
west
end
of
the
church
to
the
gatehouse
there
were
a
few
lights
visible
windows
here
and
there
just
illuminated
for
the
first
moment
chris
thought
there
had
been
a
mistake
he
had
expected
a
clamour
at
the
gate
a
jangling
of
the
bell
then
as
he
listened
he
knew
that
it
was
no
false
alarm
across
the
wall
from
the
direction
of
the
hills
that
showed
dimly
against
the
evening
sky
there
came
a
murmur
growing
as
he
listened
the
roads
were
hard
from
lack
of
rain
and
he
could
distinguish
the
sound
of
horses
a
great
company
but
rising
above
this
was
a
dull
roar
of
voices
every
moment
it
waxed
died
once
or
twice
then
sounded
out
nearer
and
louder
there
was
a
barking
of
dogs
the
cries
of
children
and
now
and
again
the
snatch
of
a
song
or
a
shouted
word
or
two
of
the
group
on
the
steps
within
not
one
stirred
except
when
sir
james
slowly
lowered
his
upraised
hand
and
so
they
waited
the
company
was
drawing
nearer
now
and
chris
calculated
that
they
must
be
coming
down
the
steep
road
that
led
from
the
town
and
even
as
he
thought
it
he
heard
the
sound
of
hoofs
on
the
bridge
that
crossed
the
winterbourne
dom
anthony
pushed
by
him
to
the
gate
he
said
and
went
down
the
step
and
across
the
court
followed
by
the
others
as
they
went
the
clamour
grew
loud
and
near
in
the
road
outside
and
a
ruddy
light
shone
on
the
projecting
turret
of
the
gateway
chris
was
conscious
of
extraordinary
coolness
now
that
the
peril
was
on
him
and
he
stared
up
at
the
studded
oak
doors
at
the
wicket
cut
in
one
of
the
leaves
and
the
sliding
panel
that
covered
the
grill
with
little
thought
but
that
of
conjecture
as
to
how
long
the
destruction
of
the
gate
would
take
the
others
too
though
he
was
scarcely
aware
of
their
presence
were
silent
and
rigid
at
his
side
as
dom
anthony
stepped
up
to
the
closed
grill
and
waited
there
for
the
summons
it
came
almost
immediately
there
was
a
great
crescendo
of
sound
as
the
party
turned
the
corner
and
a
flare
of
light
shone
under
the
gate
then
the
sound
of
loud
talking
a
silence
of
the
hoofs
and
a
sudden
jangle
on
the
bell
overhead
the
monk
turned
from
the
grill
and
lifted
his
hand
then
again
the
talking
grew
loud
as
the
mob
swept
round
the
corner
after
the
horses
still
all
was
silent
within
chris
felt
his
father
hand
seek
his
own
a
moment
and
grip
it
and
then
above
the
gabbling
clamour
a
voice
spoke
distinctly
outside
have
the
rats
run
then
the
bell
danced
again
over
their
heads
and
there
was
a
clatter
of
raps
on
the
huge
door
dom
anthony
slid
back
the
shutter
for
a
moment
it
was
not
noticed
outside
for
the
entry
was
dark
chris
could
catch
a
glimpse
on
either
side
of
the
monk
head
of
a
flare
of
light
but
no
more
then
the
same
voice
spoke
again
and
with
something
of
a
foreign
accent
you
are
there
then
make
haste
and
open
another
voice
shouted
authoritatively
for
silence
and
the
clamour
of
tongues
died
dom
anthony
waited
until
all
was
quiet
and
then
answered
steadily
who
are
you
there
was
an
oath
the
tumult
began
again
but
hushed
immediately
as
the
same
voice
that
had
called
for
admittance
shouted
aloud
open
i
tell
you
you
bloody
monk
we
come
from
the
king
why
do
you
come
a
gabble
of
fierce
tongues
broke
out
chris
pressed
up
to
dom
back
and
looked
out
the
space
was
very
narrow
and
he
could
not
see
much
more
than
a
man
leg
across
a
saddle
the
brown
shoulder
of
a
horse
in
front
and
a
smoky
haze
beyond
and
over
the
horse
back
the
leg
shifted
a
little
as
he
watched
as
if
the
rider
turned
and
then
again
the
voice
pealed
out
above
the
tumult
will
you
open
sir
for
the
last
time
i
will
not
shouted
the
monk
through
the
grill
you
are
nothing
but
then
he
dashed
the
shutter
into
its
place
as
a
stick
struck
fiercely
at
the
bars
back
to
the
cloister
he
said
the
roar
outside
was
tremendous
as
the
six
went
back
across
the
empty
court
but
it
fell
to
a
sinister
silence
as
an
order
or
two
was
shouted
outside
and
then
again
swelled
with
an
excited
note
in
it
as
the
first
crash
sounded
on
the
panels
chris
looked
at
his
father
as
they
stood
again
on
the
steps
fifty
yards
away
the
old
man
was
standing
rigid
his
hands
at
his
sides
staring
out
towards
the
arch
of
the
gateway
that
now
thundered
like
a
drum
and
his
lips
were
moving
once
he
caught
his
breath
as
a
voice
shouted
above
the
din
outside
and
half
turned
to
his
son
his
hand
uplifted
as
if
for
silence
then
again
the
voice
pealed
and
sir
james
faced
round
and
stared
into
chris
eyes
but
neither
spoke
a
word
dom
anthony
who
was
standing
a
yard
or
two
in
front
turned
presently
as
the
sound
of
splintering
began
to
be
mingled
with
the
reverberations
and
came
towards
them
his
square
full
face
was
steady
and
alert
and
he
spoke
with
a
sharp
decision
you
and
sir
nicholas
sir
had
best
be
within
my
place
will
be
here
they
will
be
in
immediately
his
words
were
perfectly
distinct
here
in
the
open
air
in
spite
of
the
uproar
from
the
gate
there
was
an
indignant
burst
from
the
young
squire
no
no
father
i
shall
not
stir
from
here
the
monk
looked
at
him
but
said
no
more
and
turned
round
a
sedate
voice
spoke
from
the
dark
doorway
behind
john
and
i
have
fetched
out
a
table
or
two
father
we
can
brace
this
door
dom
anthony
turned
again
we
shall
not
resist
further
he
said
then
they
were
silent
for
they
were
helpless
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
stand
there
and
listen
to
the
din
to
the
crash
that
splintered
more
every
moment
in
the
cracked
woodwork
and
to
watch
the
high
wall
and
turret
solemn
and
strong
against
the
stars
and
bright
here
and
there
at
the
edges
with
the
light
from
the
torches
beneath
the
opposite
them
was
dark
except
for
one
window
in
the
upper
floor
that
glowed
and
faded
with
the
light
of
the
fire
that
had
been
kindled
within
an
hour
or
two
before
sir
james
took
his
son
suddenly
by
the
arm
and
you
chris
he
said
i
shall
stay
here
father
there
was
a
rending
thunder
from
the
gate
the
wicket
reeled
in
and
fell
and
in
a
moment
through
the
flimsy
opening
had
sprung
the
figure
of
a
man
they
could
see
him
plainly
as
he
stood
there
in
the
light
of
the
torches
a
tall
upright
figure
a
feathered
hat
on
his
head
and
a
riding
cane
in
his
hand
the
noise
was
indescribable
outside
as
men
fought
to
get
through
there
was
one
scream
of
pain
the
plunging
of
a
horse
and
then
a
loud
steady
roar
drowning
all
else
the
oblong
patch
of
light
was
darkened
immediately
as
another
man
sprang
through
and
then
another
and
another
then
a
pause
then
the
bright
flare
of
a
torch
shone
in
the
opening
and
a
moment
later
a
fellow
carrying
a
flambeau
had
made
his
way
through
the
whole
space
under
the
arch
was
now
illuminated
overhead
the
plain
mouldings
shone
out
and
faded
as
the
torch
swayed
every
brick
of
the
walls
was
visible
and
the
studs
and
bars
of
the
huge
doors
chris
had
sprung
forward
by
an
uncontrollable
impulse
as
the
wicket
fell
in
and
the
two
monks
were
now
standing
motionless
on
the
floor
of
the
court
side
by
side
in
their
black
habits
and
scapulars
hooded
and
girded
with
the
two
gentlemen
and
the
servants
on
the
steps
behind
chris
saw
the
leaders
come
together
under
the
arch
as
the
whole
gate
began
to
groan
and
bulge
under
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
and
a
moment
later
he
caught
the
flash
of
steel
as
the
long
rapiers
whisked
out
then
above
the
baying
he
heard
a
fierce
authoritative
voice
scream
out
an
order
and
saw
that
one
of
the
gentlemen
in
front
was
at
the
door
his
rapier
protruded
before
him
and
understood
the
man
oe
uvre
it
was
necessary
that
the
mad
crowd
should
be
kept
back
the
tumult
died
and
became
a
murmur
and
then
one
by
one
a
file
of
figures
came
through
in
the
hand
of
each
was
an
instrument
of
some
kind
a
pick
or
a
bludgeon
and
it
was
evident
that
it
was
these
who
had
broken
in
the
gate
chris
counted
them
mechanically
as
they
streamed
through
there
seemed
to
be
a
dozen
or
so
then
again
the
man
who
had
guarded
the
door
as
they
came
through
slipped
back
through
the
opening
and
they
heard
his
voice
beginning
to
harangue
the
mob
but
a
moment
later
they
had
ceased
to
regard
him
for
from
the
archway
with
the
beside
him
advanced
the
tall
man
with
the
who
had
been
the
first
to
enter
and
as
he
emerged
into
the
court
chris
recognised
his
brother
he
was
in
a
plain
rich
with
great
boots
and
plumed
hat
he
walked
with
an
easy
air
as
if
certain
of
himself
and
neither
quickened
nor
decreased
his
pace
as
he
saw
the
monks
and
the
gentlemen
standing
there
he
halted
a
couple
of
yards
from
them
and
chris
saw
that
his
face
was
as
assured
as
his
gait
his
thin
lips
were
tight
and
firm
and
his
eyes
with
a
kind
of
insolent
irony
looked
up
and
down
the
figures
of
the
monks
there
was
not
the
faintest
sign
of
recognition
in
them
you
have
given
us
a
great
deal
of
labour
he
said
and
to
no
purpose
we
shall
have
to
report
it
all
to
my
lord
cromwell
i
understand
that
you
were
the
two
who
refused
to
sign
the
surrender
it
was
the
act
of
fools
like
this
last
i
have
no
authority
to
take
you
so
you
had
best
be
gone
dom
anthony
answered
him
in
an
equally
steady
voice
we
are
ready
to
go
now
he
said
you
understand
we
have
yielded
to
nothing
but
force
ralph
lips
writhed
in
a
smile
oh
if
that
pleases
you
he
said
well
then
he
took
a
little
step
aside
and
made
a
movement
towards
the
gate
where
there
sounded
out
still
an
angry
hum
beneath
the
shouting
voice
that
was
addressing
them
chris
turned
to
his
father
behind
and
the
voice
died
in
his
throat
so
dreadful
was
that
face
that
was
looking
at
ralph
he
was
standing
as
before
rigid
it
seemed
with
grief
or
anger
and
his
grey
eyes
were
bright
with
a
tense
emotion
his
lips
too
were
as
firm
as
his
son
but
he
spoke
no
word
sir
nicholas
was
at
his
side
with
one
foot
advanced
and
in
attitude
as
if
to
spring
and
morris
face
looked
like
a
mask
over
his
shoulder
well
then
said
ralph
once
more
ah
you
damned
hound
roared
the
young
squire
voice
and
his
hand
went
up
with
the
whip
in
it
ralph
did
not
move
a
muscle
he
seemed
cut
in
steel
let
us
go
said
dom
anthony
again
to
chris
almost
tenderly
it
is
enough
that
we
are
turned
out
by
force
you
can
go
by
the
church
if
you
will
said
ralph
composedly
in
fact
he
stopped
as
the
murmur
howled
up
again
from
the
gate
in
fact
you
had
better
go
that
way
they
do
not
seem
to
be
your
friends
out
there
we
will
go
whichever
way
you
wish
remarked
the
elder
monk
then
the
church
said
ralph
or
some
other
private
door
i
suppose
you
have
one
most
of
your
houses
have
one
i
believe
the
sneer
snapped
the
tension
dom
anthony
turned
his
back
on
him
instantly
come
brother
he
said
chris
took
his
father
by
the
arm
as
he
went
up
the
steps
come
sir
he
said
we
are
to
go
this
way
there
was
a
moment
pause
the
old
man
still
stared
down
at
his
elder
son
who
was
standing
below
in
the
same
position
chris
heard
a
deep
breath
and
thought
he
was
on
the
point
of
speaking
but
there
was
silence
then
the
two
turned
and
followed
the
others
into
the
cloister
chapter
vii
axes
and
hammers
chris
sat
next
morning
at
a
high
window
of
a
house
near
saint
looking
down
towards
the
south
of
the
town
they
had
escaped
without
difficulty
the
night
before
through
the
with
a
man
whom
ralph
sent
after
them
to
see
that
they
carried
nothing
away
leaving
the
crowd
roaring
round
the
corner
of
the
gate
and
though
people
looked
curiously
at
the
monks
the
five
laymen
with
them
protected
them
from
assault
morris
had
found
a
lodging
a
couple
of
days
before
unknown
to
chris
in
the
house
of
a
woman
who
was
favourable
to
the
religious
and
had
guided
the
party
straight
there
on
the
previous
evening
the
two
monks
had
said
mass
in
saint
michael
that
morning
before
the
town
was
awake
and
were
now
keeping
within
doors
at
sir
james
earnest
request
while
the
two
gentlemen
with
one
of
the
servants
had
gone
to
see
what
was
being
done
at
the
priory
from
where
chris
sat
in
his
black
habit
at
the
leaded
window
he
could
see
straight
down
the
opening
of
the
steep
street
across
the
lower
roofs
below
to
where
the
great
pile
of
the
priory
church
less
than
away
soared
up
in
the
sunlight
against
the
where
the
ouse
ran
to
the
south
of
the
town
the
street
was
very
empty
below
him
for
every
human
being
that
could
do
so
had
gone
down
to
the
sacking
of
the
priory
there
might
be
pickings
scraps
gathered
from
the
hoards
that
the
monks
were
supposed
to
have
gathered
there
would
probably
be
an
auction
and
there
would
certainly
be
plenty
of
excitement
and
pleasure
chris
was
himself
almost
numb
to
sensation
the
coolness
that
had
condensed
round
his
soul
last
night
had
hardened
into
ice
he
scarcely
realised
what
was
going
on
or
how
great
was
the
catastrophe
into
which
his
life
was
plunged
there
lay
the
roofs
before
him
he
ran
his
eye
from
the
west
tower
past
the
high
lantern
to
the
delicate
tracery
of
the
eastern
apse
and
chapels
in
the
hands
of
the
spoilers
and
here
he
sat
and
looking
down
on
it
as
a
man
looks
at
a
wound
not
yet
begun
to
smart
it
was
piteously
clear
and
still
smoke
was
rising
from
a
fire
somewhere
behind
the
church
a
noise
as
of
metal
on
stone
chinked
steadily
and
the
voices
of
men
calling
one
to
another
sounded
continually
from
the
enclosure
now
and
again
the
tiny
figure
of
a
workman
showed
clear
on
the
roof
pick
in
hand
or
leaning
to
call
directions
down
to
his
fellows
beneath
dom
anthony
looked
in
presently
breviary
in
hand
and
knelt
by
chris
on
the
watching
too
but
he
spoke
no
word
glanced
at
the
white
face
and
sunken
eyes
of
the
other
sighed
once
or
twice
and
went
out
again
the
morning
passed
on
and
still
chris
watched
by
eleven
the
men
were
gone
from
the
roof
half
an
hour
had
passed
and
no
further
figure
had
appeared
there
were
footsteps
on
the
stairs
and
sir
james
came
in
he
came
straight
across
to
his
son
and
sat
down
by
him
chris
looked
at
him
the
old
man
nodded
yes
my
son
he
said
they
are
at
it
nothing
is
to
be
left
but
the
cloister
and
the
church
is
to
be
down
in
a
week
they
say
chris
looked
at
him
dully
all
he
said
all
the
church
my
son
sir
james
gave
an
account
of
what
he
had
seen
he
had
made
his
way
in
with
nicholas
and
a
few
other
persons
into
the
court
but
had
not
been
allowed
to
enter
the
cloister
there
was
a
furnace
being
made
ready
in
the
calefactorium
for
the
melting
of
the
lead
he
had
been
told
by
one
of
the
men
and
the
church
as
he
had
seen
for
himself
was
full
of
workmen
and
the
blessed
sacrament
asked
chris
a
priest
was
sent
for
this
morning
to
carry
it
away
to
a
church
i
know
not
which
sir
james
described
the
method
of
destruction
they
were
beginning
with
the
apse
and
the
chapels
behind
the
high
altar
the
ornaments
had
been
removed
the
images
piled
in
a
great
heap
in
the
outer
court
and
the
brasses
had
been
torn
up
there
were
half
a
dozen
masons
busy
at
undercutting
the
pillars
and
walls
and
as
they
excavated
the
carpenters
made
wooden
insertions
to
prop
up
the
weight
the
men
had
been
brought
down
from
london
as
the
commissioners
were
not
certain
of
the
temper
of
the
lewes
people
two
of
the
four
great
pillars
behind
the
high
altar
were
already
cut
half
through
and
ralph
the
old
man
face
grew
tense
and
bitter
i
saw
him
in
the
roof
he
said
he
made
as
if
he
did
not
see
me
they
were
dinner
before
nicholas
joined
them
he
was
flushed
and
dusty
and
furious
ah
the
hounds
he
said
as
he
stood
at
the
door
trembling
they
say
they
will
have
the
chapels
down
before
night
they
have
stripped
the
lead
sir
james
looked
up
and
motioned
him
to
sit
down
we
will
go
down
again
presently
he
said
but
we
have
saved
our
luggage
went
on
nicholas
taking
his
seat
and
there
was
a
parcel
of
yours
chris
that
i
put
with
it
it
is
all
to
be
sent
up
with
the
horses
did
you
speak
with
mr
ralph
asked
dom
anthony
ah
i
did
the
dog
and
i
told
him
what
i
thought
but
he
dared
not
refuse
me
the
luggage
john
is
to
go
for
it
all
he
told
them
during
dinner
another
fact
that
he
had
learned
you
know
who
is
to
have
it
all
he
said
fiercely
his
fingers
twitching
with
emotion
it
is
master
gregory
cromwell
and
his
wife
and
his
baby
a
fine
nursery
as
the
evening
drew
on
chris
was
again
at
the
window
alone
he
had
said
his
office
earlier
in
the
afternoon
and
sat
here
again
now
with
his
hands
before
him
staring
down
at
the
church
one
of
the
servants
had
come
up
with
a
message
from
sir
james
an
hour
before
telling
him
not
to
expect
them
before
dusk
and
that
they
would
send
up
news
of
any
further
developments
the
whole
town
was
there
said
the
man
it
had
been
found
impossible
to
keep
them
out
dom
anthony
presently
came
again
and
sat
with
chris
and
morris
who
had
been
left
as
a
safeguard
to
the
monks
slipped
in
soon
after
and
stood
behind
the
two
and
so
the
three
waited
the
sky
was
beginning
to
glow
again
as
it
had
done
last
night
with
the
clear
radiance
of
a
cloudless
sunset
and
the
tall
west
tower
stood
up
bright
in
the
glory
how
infinitely
far
away
last
night
seemed
now
little
and
yet
distinct
as
a
landscape
seen
through
a
reversed
telescope
how
far
away
that
silent
waiting
at
the
cloister
door
the
clamour
at
the
gate
the
forced
entrance
the
slipping
away
through
the
church
the
smoke
was
rising
faster
than
ever
now
from
the
great
chimney
and
hung
in
a
cloud
above
the
buildings
perhaps
even
now
the
lead
was
being
cast
there
was
a
clatter
at
the
corner
of
the
cobbled
street
below
and
dom
anthony
leaned
from
the
window
he
drew
back
it
is
the
horses
he
said
the
servant
presently
came
up
to
announce
that
the
two
gentlemen
were
following
immediately
and
that
he
had
had
orders
to
procure
horses
and
saddle
them
at
once
he
had
understood
sir
james
to
say
that
they
must
leave
that
night
morris
hurried
out
to
see
to
the
packing
in
five
minutes
the
gentlemen
themselves
appeared
sir
james
came
quickly
across
to
the
two
monks
we
must
go
chris
he
said
we
had
words
with
portinari
you
must
not
remain
longer
in
the
town
chris
looked
at
him
yes
he
said
and
the
chapels
will
be
down
immediately
oh
dear
god
dom
anthony
made
room
for
the
old
man
to
sit
down
in
the
and
himself
stood
behind
the
two
with
nicholas
and
so
again
they
watched
the
light
was
fading
fast
now
and
in
the
windows
below
lights
were
beginning
to
shine
the
square
western
tower
that
dominated
the
whole
priory
had
lost
its
splendour
and
stood
up
strong
and
pale
against
the
meadows
there
was
a
red
flare
of
light
somewhere
over
the
wall
of
the
court
and
the
inner
side
of
the
was
illuminated
by
it
a
tense
excitement
lay
on
the
watchers
and
no
sound
came
from
them
but
that
of
quick
breathing
as
they
waited
for
what
they
knew
was
imminent
outside
the
evening
was
wonderfully
still
they
could
hear
two
men
talking
somewhere
in
the
street
below
but
from
the
priory
came
no
sound
the
chink
of
the
picks
was
still
and
the
cries
of
the
workmen
far
away
beyond
the
castle
on
their
left
came
an
insistent
barking
of
a
dog
and
once
when
a
horseman
rode
by
below
chris
bit
his
lip
with
vexation
for
it
seemed
to
him
like
the
disturbing
of
a
death
bed
a
star
or
two
looked
out
vanished
and
peeped
again
from
the
luminous
sky
to
the
south
and
the
downs
beneath
were
grey
and
hazy
all
the
watchers
now
had
their
eyes
on
the
eastern
end
of
the
church
that
lay
in
dim
shadow
they
could
see
the
roof
of
the
vault
behind
where
the
high
altar
lay
beneath
the
flying
buttress
of
a
chapel
below
and
nearer
the
low
roof
of
the
chris
kept
his
eyes
strained
on
the
upper
vault
for
there
he
knew
the
first
movement
would
show
itself
the
time
seemed
interminable
he
moistened
his
dry
lips
from
time
to
time
shifted
his
position
a
little
and
moved
his
elbow
from
the
sharp
moulding
of
the
then
he
caught
his
breath
from
where
he
sat
in
the
direct
line
of
his
eyes
the
top
of
a
patch
of
evergreen
copse
was
visible
just
beyond
the
roof
of
the
vault
and
as
he
looked
he
saw
that
a
patch
of
paler
green
had
appeared
below
it
all
in
a
moment
he
saw
too
the
flying
buttress
crook
itself
like
an
elbow
and
disappear
then
the
vault
was
gone
and
the
roof
beyond
the
walls
sank
with
incredible
slowness
and
vanished
a
cloud
of
white
dust
puffed
up
like
smoke
then
through
the
open
window
came
the
roar
of
the
tumbling
masonry
and
shrill
above
it
the
clamour
of
a
great
crowd
book

a
scheme
the
period
that
followed
the
destruction
of
lewes
priory
held
very
strange
months
for
chris
he
had
slipped
out
of
the
stream
into
a
from
which
he
could
watch
the
swift
movements
of
the
time
while
himself
undisturbed
by
them
for
no
further
notice
was
taken
of
his
refusal
to
sign
the
surrender
or
of
his
resistance
to
the
commissioners
the
hands
of
the
authorities
were
so
full
of
business
that
apparently
it
was
not
worth
their
while
to
trouble
about
an
inoffensive
monk
of
no
particular
notoriety
who
after
all
had
done
little
except
in
a
negative
way
and
who
appeared
now
to
acquiesce
in
silence
and
seclusion
the
household
at
overfield
was
of
a
very
mixed
nature
dom
anthony
after
a
month
or
two
had
left
for
the
continent
to
take
up
his
vocation
in
a
benedictine
house
and
sir
james
and
his
wife
chris
margaret
and
carleton
remained
together
for
the
present
chris
and
margaret
were
determined
to
wait
for
a
hundred
things
might
intervene
henry
death
a
changing
of
his
mind
a
foreign
invasion
on
the
part
of
the
catholic
powers
an
internal
revolt
in
england
and
such
things
and
set
the
clock
back
again
and
unlike
dom
anthony
they
had
a
home
where
they
could
follow
their
rules
in
tolerable
comfort
the
country
was
indeed
very
deeply
stirred
by
the
events
that
were
taking
place
but
for
the
present
partly
from
terror
and
partly
from
the
great
forces
that
were
brought
to
bear
upon
english
convictions
it
gave
no
expression
to
its
emotion
the
methods
that
cromwell
had
employed
with
such
skill
in
the
past
were
still
active
on
the
worldly
side
there
was
held
out
to
the
people
the
hope
of
relieved
taxation
of
the
distribution
of
monastic
wealth
and
lands
on
the
spiritual
side
the
bishops
under
cranmer
were
zealous
in
controverting
the
old
principles
and
throwing
doubt
upon
the
authority
of
the
pope
it
was
impossible
for
the
unlearned
to
know
what
to
believe
new
manifestoes
were
issued
continually
by
the
king
and
clergy
full
of
learned
arguments
and
persuasive
appeals
and
the
professors
of
the
old
religion
were
continually
discredited
by
accusations
of
fraud
avarice
immorality
hypocrisy
and
the
like
they
were
silenced
too
while
active
and
eloquent
preachers
like
latimer
raged
from
pulpit
to
pulpit
denouncing
expounding
convincing
meanwhile
the
work
went
on
rapidly
the
summer
and
autumn
of
saw
again
destruction
after
destruction
of
religious
houses
and
objects
of
veneration
and
the
intimidation
of
the
most
influential
personages
on
the
catholic
side
in
february
for
example
the
rood
of
boxley
was
brought
up
to
london
with
every
indignity
and
after
being
exhibited
with
shouts
of
laughter
at
whitehall
and
preached
against
at
paul
cross
it
was
tossed
down
among
the
zealous
citizens
and
smashed
to
pieces
in
the
summer
among
others
the
shrine
of
swithun
at
winchester
was
defaced
and
robbed
and
in
the
autumn
that
followed
the
friaries
which
had
stood
out
so
long
began
to
fall
right
and
left
in
october
the
holy
blood
of
hayles
a
relic
brought
from
the
east
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
preserved
with
great
love
and
honour
ever
since
was
taken
from
its
resting
place
and
exposed
to
ridicule
in
london
finally
in
the
same
month
after
thomas
of
canterbury
had
been
solemnly
declared
a
traitor
to
his
prince
his
name
images
and
pictures
ordered
to
be
erased
and
destroyed
out
of
every
book
window
and
wall
and
he
himself
summoned
with
grotesque
solemnity
to
answer
the
charges
brought
against
him
his
relics
were
seized
and
burned
and
which
was
more
to
the
point
in
the
king
view
his
shrine
was
stripped
of
its
gold
and
jewels
and
vestments
which
were
conveyed
in
a
string
of
carts
to
the
king
treasury
the
following
year
events
were
yet
more
terrible
the
few
great
houses
that
survived
were
one
by
one
brought
within
reach
of
the
king
hand
and
those
that
did
not
voluntarily
surrender
fell
under
the
heavier
penalties
of
attainder
abbot
whiting
of
glastonbury
was
sent
up
to
london
in
september
and
two
months
later
suffered
on
tor
hill
within
sight
of
the
monastery
he
had
ruled
so
long
and
so
justly
and
on
the
same
day
the
abbot
of
reading
suffered
too
outside
his
own
gateway
six
weeks
afterwards
abbot
marshall
of
colchester
was
also
put
to
death
it
was
a
piteous
life
that
devout
persons
led
at
this
time
and
few
were
more
unhappy
than
the
household
at
overfield
it
was
the
more
miserable
because
lady
torridon
herself
was
so
entirely
out
of
sympathy
with
the
others
while
she
was
not
often
the
actual
bearer
of
ill
news
for
she
had
neither
sufficient
strenuousness
nor
opportunity
for
it
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
that
she
enjoyed
its
arrival
they
were
all
together
at
supper
one
warm
summer
evening
when
a
servant
came
in
to
announce
that
a
monk
of
swithun
was
asking
hospitality
sir
james
glanced
at
his
wife
who
sat
with
passive
downcast
face
and
then
ordered
the
priest
to
be
brought
in
he
was
a
timid
tactless
man
who
failed
to
grasp
the
situation
and
when
the
wine
and
food
had
warmed
his
heart
he
began
to
talk
a
great
deal
too
freely
taking
it
for
granted
that
all
there
were
in
sympathy
with
him
he
addressed
himself
chiefly
to
chris
who
answered
courteously
and
described
the
sacking
of
the
shrine
at
some
length
he
had
already
set
aside
our
cross
called
hierusalem
cried
the
monk
his
weak
face
looking
infinitely
pathetic
with
its
mingled
sorrow
and
anger
and
two
of
our
gold
chalices
to
take
them
with
him
when
he
went
and
then
with
his
knives
and
hammers
as
the
psalmist
tells
us
he
hacked
off
the
silver
plates
from
the
shrine
there
was
a
fellow
i
knew
very
well
he
had
been
to
me
to
confession
two
days
before
who
held
a
candle
and
laughed
and
then
when
all
was
done
and
that
was
not
till
three
in
the
morning
one
of
the
smiths
tested
the
metal
and
cried
out
that
there
was
not
one
piece
of
true
gold
in
it
all
and
pollard
raged
at
us
for
it
and
told
us
that
our
gold
was
as
counterfeit
as
the
rotten
bones
that
we
worshipped
but
indeed
there
was
plenty
of
gold
and
the
man
lied
for
it
was
a
very
rich
shrine
god
vengeance
will
fall
on
them
for
their
lies
and
their
robbery
is
it
not
so
mistress
lady
torridon
lifted
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
her
husband
hastened
to
interpose
have
you
finished
your
wine
father
the
monk
seemed
not
to
hear
him
and
his
talk
flowed
on
about
the
destruction
of
the
high
altar
and
the
spoiling
of
the
reredos
which
had
taken
place
on
the
following
days
and
as
he
talked
he
filled
his
venetian
glass
more
than
once
and
drank
it
off
and
his
lantern
face
grew
flushed
and
his
eyes
animated
chris
saw
that
his
mother
was
watching
the
monk
shrewdly
and
narrowly
and
feared
what
might
come
but
it
was
unavoidable
we
poor
monks
the
priest
cried
presently
shall
soon
be
cast
out
to
beg
our
bread
the
king
grace
is
not
poverty
one
of
the
monastic
vows
put
in
lady
torridon
suddenly
still
looking
steadily
at
his
glass
why
yes
mistress
and
the
king
grace
is
determined
to
make
us
keep
it
it
seems
he
lifted
his
glass
and
finished
it
and
put
out
his
hand
again
to
the
bottle
but
that
is
a
good
work
surely
smiled
the
other
it
will
be
surely
a
safeguard
against
surfeiting
and
drunkenness
sir
james
rose
instantly
come
father
he
said
to
the
staring
monk
you
will
be
tired
out
and
will
want
your
bed
a
slow
smile
shone
and
faded
on
his
wife
face
as
she
rose
and
rustled
down
the
long
hall
such
incidents
as
this
made
life
at
overfield
very
difficult
for
them
all
it
was
hard
for
these
sore
hearts
to
be
continually
on
the
watch
for
dangerous
subjects
and
only
to
be
able
to
comfort
one
another
when
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
absent
but
above
all
it
was
difficult
for
margaret
she
was
nearly
as
silent
as
her
mother
but
infinitely
more
tender
and
since
the
two
were
naturally
together
for
the
most
part
except
when
the
nun
was
at
her
long
prayers
there
were
often
very
difficult
and
painful
incidents
for
the
first
eighteen
months
after
her
return
her
mother
let
her
alone
but
as
time
went
on
and
the
girl
resolution
persevered
she
began
to
be
subjected
to
a
distressing
form
of
slight
persecution
for
example
chris
and
his
father
came
in
one
day
in
the
autumn
from
a
walk
through
the
priory
garden
that
lay
beyond
the
western
moat
as
they
passed
in
the
level
sunshine
along
the
prim
paths
and
had
reached
the
centre
where
the
dial
stood
they
heard
voices
in
the
that
stood
on
the
right
behind
a
yew
hedge
sir
james
hesitated
a
moment
and
as
he
waited
heard
margaret
voice
with
a
thrill
of
passion
in
it
i
can
not
listen
to
that
mother
it
is
wicked
to
say
such
things
the
two
turned
instantly
passed
along
the
path
and
came
round
the
corner
margaret
was
standing
with
one
hand
on
the
little
table
to
go
her
eyes
were
alight
with
indignation
and
her
lips
trembled
her
mother
sat
on
the
other
side
her
stick
beside
her
and
her
hands
folded
serenely
together
sir
james
looked
from
one
to
the
other
and
there
fell
a
silence
are
you
coming
with
us
margaret
he
said
the
girl
still
hesitated
a
moment
glancing
at
her
mother
and
then
stepped
out
of
the
chris
saw
that
bitter
smile
writhe
and
die
on
the
elder
woman
face
but
she
said
nothing
margaret
burst
out
presently
when
they
had
crossed
the
moat
and
were
coming
up
to
the
long
house
i
can
not
bear
such
talk
father
she
said
with
her
eyes
bright
with
angry
tears
she
was
saying
such
things
about
rusper
and
how
idle
we
all
were
there
and
how
foolish
you
must
not
mind
it
my
darling
your
mother
does
not
does
not
understand
there
was
never
any
one
like
mother
abbess
went
on
the
girl
i
never
saw
her
idle
or
out
of
humour
and
and
we
were
all
so
busy
and
happy
her
eyes
overflowed
a
moment
her
father
put
his
arm
tenderly
round
her
shoulders
and
they
went
in
together
it
was
a
terrible
thing
for
margaret
to
be
thrown
like
this
out
of
the
one
life
that
was
a
reality
to
her
as
she
looked
back
now
it
seemed
as
if
the
convent
shone
glorified
and
beautiful
in
a
haze
of
grace
the
discipline
of
the
house
had
ordered
and
inspired
the
associations
on
which
memories
afterwards
depend
and
had
excluded
the
discordant
notes
that
spoil
the
harmonies
of
secular
life
the
chapel
with
its
delicate
windows
its
oak
rails
its
scent
of
flowers
and
incense
its
tiled
floor
its
single
row
of
carved
woodwork
and
the
crosier
by
the
seat
was
a
place
of
silence
instinct
with
a
divine
presence
that
radiated
from
the
hanging
pyx
it
was
these
particular
things
and
not
others
like
them
that
had
been
the
scene
of
her
romance
with
god
her
aspirations
tendernesses
tears
and
joys
she
had
walked
in
the
tiny
cloister
with
her
lover
in
her
heart
and
the
glazed
that
rattled
in
the
garth
had
been
musical
with
his
voice
it
was
in
her
little
white
cell
that
she
had
learned
to
sleep
in
his
arms
and
to
wake
to
the
brightness
of
his
face
and
now
all
this
was
dissipated
there
were
other
associations
with
her
home
of
childish
sorrows
and
passions
before
she
had
known
god
of
and
genial
ruddy
men
who
smelt
of
fur
and
blood
of
her
mother
chilly
steady
presence
associations
that
jarred
with
the
inner
life
whereas
in
the
convent
there
had
been
nothing
that
was
not
redolent
with
efforts
and
rewards
of
the
soul
even
without
her
mother
life
would
have
been
hard
enough
now
at
overfield
with
her
it
was
nearly
intolerable
chris
however
was
able
to
do
a
good
deal
for
the
girl
for
he
had
suffered
in
the
same
way
and
had
the
advantage
of
a
man
strength
she
could
talk
to
him
as
to
no
one
else
of
the
knowledge
of
the
interior
vocation
in
both
of
them
that
persevered
in
spite
of
their
ejection
from
the
cloister
and
he
was
able
to
remind
her
that
the
essence
of
the
enclosure
under
these
circumstances
lay
in
the
spirit
and
not
in
material
stones
it
was
an
advantage
for
chris
too
to
have
her
under
his
protection
the
fact
that
he
had
to
teach
her
and
remind
her
of
facts
that
they
both
knew
made
them
more
real
to
himself
and
to
him
as
to
her
there
came
gradually
a
kind
of
contentment
that
deepened
month
by
month
in
spite
of
their
strange
and
distracting
surroundings
but
he
was
not
wholly
happy
about
her
she
was
silent
and
lonely
sometimes
he
began
to
see
what
an
immense
advantage
it
would
be
to
her
in
the
peculiarly
difficult
circumstances
of
the
time
to
have
some
one
of
her
own
sex
and
sympathies
at
hand
but
he
did
not
see
how
it
could
be
arranged
for
the
present
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
enter
the
religious
life
except
by
going
abroad
and
so
long
as
there
was
the
faintest
hope
of
the
convents
being
restored
in
england
both
she
and
her
father
and
brother
shrank
from
the
step
and
the
hope
was
increased
by
the
issue
of
the
six
articles
in
the
following
may
by
which
transubstantiation
was
declared
to
be
a
revealed
dogma
to
be
held
on
penalty
of
death
by
burning
and
communion
in
one
kind
the
celibacy
of
the
clergy
the
perpetuity
of
the
vow
of
chastity
private
masses
and
auricular
confession
were
alike
ratified
as
parts
of
the
faith
held
by
the
church
of
which
henry
had
made
himself
head
yet
as
time
went
on
and
there
were
no
signs
of
the
restoration
of
the
religious
houses
chris
began
to
wonder
again
as
to
what
was
best
for
margaret
perhaps
until
matters
developed
it
would
be
well
for
her
to
have
some
friend
in
whom
she
could
confide
even
if
only
to
relax
the
strain
for
a
few
weeks
he
went
to
his
father
one
day
in
the
autumn
and
laid
his
views
before
him
sir
james
nodded
and
seemed
to
understand
do
you
think
mary
would
be
of
any
service
chris
hesitated
yes
sir
i
think
so
but
his
father
looked
at
him
it
is
a
stranger
i
think
that
would
help
her
more
perhaps
another
nun
my
dear
lad
i
dare
not
ask
another
nun
your
mother
i
know
said
chris
well
i
will
think
of
it
said
the
other
a
couple
of
days
later
sir
james
took
him
aside
after
supper
into
his
own
private
room
chris
he
said
i
have
been
thinking
of
what
you
said
and
mary
shall
certainly
come
here
for
christmas
with
nick
but
but
there
is
someone
else
too
i
would
like
to
ask
he
looked
at
his
son
with
an
odd
expression
chris
could
not
imagine
what
this
meant
it
is
mistress
atherton
went
on
the
other
you
see
you
know
her
a
little
at
least
you
have
seen
her
and
there
is
ralph
and
from
all
that
i
have
heard
of
her
her
friendship
with
master
more
and
the
rest
i
think
she
might
be
the
very
friend
for
poor
meg
do
you
think
she
would
come
chris
chris
was
silent
he
could
not
yet
fully
dissociate
the
thought
of
beatrice
from
the
memory
of
the
time
when
she
had
taken
ralph
part
besides
was
it
possible
to
ask
her
under
the
circumstances
then
there
was
one
more
thing
that
i
never
told
you
went
on
his
father
there
was
no
use
in
it
but
i
went
to
see
mistress
atherton
when
she
was
betrothed
to
ralph
i
saw
her
in
london
and
i
think
i
may
say
we
made
friends
and
she
has
very
few
now
she
keeps
herself
aloof
folks
are
afraid
of
her
too
i
think
it
would
be
a
kindness
to
her
i
could
not
understand
how
she
could
marry
ralph
and
now
that
is
explained
chris
was
startled
by
this
news
his
father
had
not
breathed
a
word
of
it
before
she
made
me
promise
went
on
sir
james
to
tell
her
if
ralph
did
anything
unworthy
it
was
after
the
first
news
had
reached
her
of
what
the
visitors
were
doing
and
i
told
her
of
course
about
rusper
i
think
we
owe
her
something
and
i
think
too
from
what
i
saw
of
her
that
she
might
make
her
way
with
your
mother
it
might
succeed
said
chris
doubtfully
but
it
is
surely
difficult
for
her
to
come
i
know
yes
with
ralph
and
her
betrothal
but
if
we
can
ask
her
surely
she
can
come
i
can
tell
her
how
much
we
need
her
i
would
send
meg
to
great
keynes
if
i
dared
but
i
dare
not
it
is
not
so
safe
there
as
here
she
had
best
keep
quiet
they
talked
about
it
a
few
minutes
more
and
chris
became
more
inclined
to
it
from
what
he
remembered
of
beatrice
and
the
impression
that
she
had
made
on
him
in
those
few
fierce
minutes
in
ralph
house
he
began
to
see
that
she
would
probably
be
able
to
hold
her
own
and
if
only
margaret
would
take
to
her
the
elder
girl
might
be
of
great
service
in
establishing
the
younger
it
was
an
odd
and
rather
piquant
idea
and
gradually
took
hold
of
his
imagination
it
was
a
very
extreme
step
to
take
considering
that
she
had
broken
off
her
betrothal
to
the
eldest
son
of
the
house
but
against
that
was
set
the
fact
that
she
would
not
meet
him
there
and
that
her
presence
would
be
really
valued
by
at
least
of
the
household
it
was
decided
that
lady
torridon
should
be
told
immediately
and
a
day
or
two
later
sir
james
came
to
chris
in
the
garden
to
tell
him
that
she
had
consented
i
do
not
understand
it
at
all
said
the
old
man
but
your
mother
seemed
very
willing
i
wonder
and
then
he
stopped
abruptly
the
letter
was
sent
chris
saw
it
and
the
strong
appeal
it
contained
that
beatrice
should
come
to
the
aid
of
a
nun
who
was
pining
for
want
of
companionship
a
day
or
two
later
brought
down
the
answer
that
mistress
atherton
would
have
great
pleasure
in
coming
a
week
before
christmas
margaret
had
a
fit
of
shyness
when
the
day
came
for
her
arrival
it
was
a
clear
frosty
afternoon
with
a
keen
turquoise
sky
overhead
and
she
wandered
out
in
her
habit
down
the
slope
to
the
moat
crossed
the
bridge
glancing
at
the
thin
ice
and
the
sedge
that
pierced
it
and
came
up
into
the
private
garden
she
knew
she
could
hear
the
sounds
of
wheels
from
there
and
had
an
instinctive
shrinking
from
being
at
the
house
when
the
stranger
arrived
the
grass
walks
were
crisp
to
the
foot
the
plants
in
the
deep
beds
rested
in
a
rigid
stillness
with
a
black
blossom
or
two
drooping
here
and
there
and
the
hollies
beyond
the
yew
hedge
lifted
masses
of
green
lit
by
scarlet
against
the
pale
sky
her
breath
went
up
like
smoke
as
she
walked
softly
up
and
down
there
was
no
sound
to
disturb
her
once
she
heard
the
clink
of
the
blacksmith
forge
half
a
mile
away
in
the
village
once
a
blackbird
dashed
chattering
from
a
hedge
scudded
in
a
long
dip
and
rose
again
over
it
a
robin
followed
her
in
brisk
hops
with
a
kind
of
pathetic
impertinence
in
his
round
eye
as
he
wondered
whether
this
human
creature
footsteps
would
not
break
the
iron
armour
of
the
ground
and
give
him
a
chance
to
live
she
wondered
a
thousand
things
as
she
went
what
kind
of
a
woman
this
was
that
was
coming
how
she
would
look
why
she
had
not
married
ralph
and
above
all
whether
she
understood
whether
she
understood
a
kind
of
frost
had
fallen
on
her
own
soul
she
could
find
no
sustenance
there
it
was
all
there
she
knew
all
the
mysterious
life
that
had
rioted
within
her
like
spring
in
the
convent
breathing
its
fragrances
bewildering
in
its
wealth
of
shape
and
colour
but
an
icy
breath
had
petrified
it
all
it
had
sunk
down
out
of
sight
it
needed
a
soul
like
her
own
feminine
and
sympathetic
a
soul
that
had
experienced
the
same
things
as
her
own
that
knew
the
tenderness
and
love
of
the
saviour
to
melt
that
frigid
covering
and
draw
out
the
essences
and
sweetness
again
that
lay
there
paralysed
by
this
icy
environment
there
were
wheels
at
last
she
gathered
up
her
black
skirt
and
ran
to
the
edge
of
the
low
yews
that
bounded
the
garden
on
the
north
and
as
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
nodding
heads
of
the
postilions
the
plumes
of
their
mounts
and
the
great
swaying
in
the
iron
ruts
she
shrank
back
again
in
an
agony
of
shyness
terrified
of
being
seen
the
sky
had
deepened
to
flaming
orange
in
the
west
barred
by
the
tall
pines
before
she
unlatched
the
to
go
back
to
the
house
the
windows
shone
out
bright
and
inviting
from
the
parlour
on
the
and
from
beneath
the
high
gable
of
the
hall
as
she
came
up
the
slope
mistress
atherton
she
knew
would
be
in
one
of
these
rooms
if
she
had
not
already
gone
up
stairs
and
with
an
instinct
of
shyness
still
strong
within
her
the
girl
slipped
round
to
the
back
and
passed
in
through
the
chapel
the
court
was
lighted
by
a
link
that
flared
beside
one
of
the
doorways
on
the
left
and
a
couple
of
great
trunks
lay
below
it
a
servant
came
out
as
she
stood
there
hesitating
and
she
called
to
him
softly
to
know
where
was
mistress
atherton
she
is
in
the
parlour
mistress
margaret
said
the
man
the
girl
went
slowly
across
to
the
corner
doorway
glancing
at
the
parlour
windows
as
she
passed
but
the
curtains
were
drawn
on
this
side
and
she
could
catch
no
glimpse
of
the
party
within
the
little
entrance
passage
was
dark
but
she
could
hear
a
murmur
of
voices
as
she
stood
there
still
hesitating
then
she
opened
the
door
suddenly
and
went
into
the
room
her
mother
was
speaking
and
the
girl
heard
those
icy
detached
tones
as
she
looked
round
the
group
it
must
be
very
difficult
for
you
mistress
atherton
in
these
days
margaret
saw
her
father
standing
at
the
and
chris
beside
him
and
in
a
moment
saw
that
the
faces
of
both
were
troubled
and
uneasy
a
tall
girl
was
in
the
chair
opposite
her
hands
lying
easily
on
the
arms
and
her
head
thrown
back
almost
negligently
she
was
well
dressed
with
furs
about
her
throat
her
buckled
feet
were
crossed
before
the
blaze
and
her
fingers
shone
with
jewels
her
face
was
pale
her
scarlet
lips
were
smiling
and
there
was
a
certain
keen
and
genial
amusement
in
her
black
eyes
she
looked
magnificent
thought
margaret
still
standing
with
her
hand
on
the
door
too
magnificent
her
father
made
a
movement
it
seemed
of
relief
as
his
daughter
came
in
but
lady
torridon
very
upright
in
her
chair
on
this
side
went
on
immediately
with
your
opinions
mistress
atherton
i
mean
i
suppose
all
that
you
consider
sacred
is
being
insulted
in
your
eyes
the
tall
girl
glanced
at
margaret
with
the
amusement
still
in
her
face
and
then
answered
with
a
deliberate
incisiveness
that
equalled
lady
torridon
own
not
so
difficult
she
said
as
for
those
who
have
no
opinions
there
was
a
momentary
pause
and
then
she
added
as
she
stood
up
and
sir
james
came
forward
i
am
very
sorry
for
them
mistress
torridon
before
lady
torridon
could
answer
sir
james
had
broken
in
this
is
my
daughter
margaret
mistress
atherton
the
two
ladies
saluted
one
another
chapter
ii
a
duel
margaret
watched
beatrice
with
growing
excitement
that
evening
in
which
was
mingled
something
of
awe
and
something
of
attraction
she
had
never
seen
anyone
so
serenely
it
became
evident
during
supper
beyond
the
possibility
of
mistake
that
lady
torridon
had
planned
war
against
the
guest
who
was
a
representative
in
her
eyes
of
all
that
was
and
contemptible
here
was
a
girl
she
seemed
to
tell
herself
who
had
had
every
opportunity
of
emancipation
who
had
been
singularly
favoured
in
being
noticed
by
ralph
and
who
had
audaciously
thrown
him
over
for
the
sake
of
some
ridiculous
scruples
worthy
only
of
idiots
and
nuns
indeed
to
chris
it
was
fairly
plain
that
his
mother
had
consented
so
willingly
to
beatrice
visit
with
the
express
purpose
of
punishing
her
but
beatrice
held
her
own
triumphantly
they
had
not
sat
down
three
minutes
before
lady
torridon
opened
the
assault
with
grave
downcast
face
and
in
her
silkiest
manner
she
went
abruptly
back
to
the
point
where
the
conversation
had
been
interrupted
in
the
parlour
by
margaret
entrance
mistress
atherton
she
observed
playing
delicately
with
her
spoon
i
think
you
said
that
to
your
mind
the
times
were
difficult
for
those
who
had
no
opinions
beatrice
looked
at
her
pleasantly
yes
mistress
torridon
at
least
more
difficult
for
those
than
for
the
others
who
know
their
own
mind
the
other
waited
a
moment
expecting
the
girl
to
justify
herself
but
she
was
forced
to
go
on
abbot
marshall
knew
his
mind
but
it
was
not
easy
for
him
the
news
had
just
arrived
of
the
abbot
execution
do
you
think
not
mistress
i
fear
i
still
hold
my
opinion
and
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
that
unless
we
have
something
to
hold
to
in
these
troublesome
times
we
shall
drift
that
is
all
ah
and
drift
whither
beatrice
smiled
so
genially
as
she
answered
that
the
other
had
no
excuse
for
taking
offence
well
it
might
be
better
not
to
answer
that
lady
torridon
looked
at
her
with
an
impassive
face
to
hell
then
she
said
well
yes
to
hell
said
beatrice
there
was
a
profound
silence
broken
by
the
stifled
merriment
of
a
servant
behind
the
chairs
who
transformed
it
hastily
into
a
cough
sir
james
glanced
across
in
great
distress
at
his
son
but
chris
eyes
twinkled
at
him
lady
torridon
was
silent
a
moment
completely
taken
aback
by
the
suddenness
with
which
the
battle
had
broken
and
amazed
by
the
audacity
she
herself
was
accustomed
to
use
brutality
but
not
to
meet
it
she
laid
her
spoon
carefully
down
ah
she
said
and
you
believe
that
and
for
those
who
hold
wrong
opinions
i
suppose
you
would
believe
the
same
if
they
were
wrong
enough
said
beatrice
and
through
their
fault
surely
we
are
taught
to
believe
that
mistress
torridon
the
elder
woman
said
nothing
at
all
and
went
on
with
her
soup
her
silence
was
almost
more
formidable
than
her
speech
and
she
knew
that
and
contrived
to
make
it
offensive
beatrice
paid
no
sort
of
attention
to
it
however
and
without
looking
at
her
again
began
to
talk
cheerfully
to
sir
james
about
her
journey
from
town
margaret
watched
her
fascinated
her
sedate
beautiful
face
her
lace
and
jewels
her
white
fingers
long
and
straight
that
seemed
to
endorse
the
impression
of
strength
that
her
carriage
and
manner
of
speaking
suggested
as
one
might
watch
a
swordsman
between
the
rounds
of
a
duel
and
calculate
his
chances
she
knew
very
well
that
her
mother
would
not
take
her
first
repulse
easily
and
waited
in
anxiety
for
the
next
clash
of
swords
beatrice
seemed
perfectly
fearless
and
was
talking
about
the
king
with
complete
freedom
and
yet
with
a
certain
discretion
too
he
will
have
his
way
she
said
who
can
doubt
that
lady
torridon
saw
an
opening
for
a
wound
and
leapt
at
it
as
he
had
with
master
more
she
put
in
beatrice
turned
her
head
a
little
but
made
no
answer
and
there
was
not
the
shadow
of
wincing
on
her
steady
face
as
he
had
with
master
more
said
lady
torridon
a
little
louder
we
must
remember
that
he
has
my
lord
cromwell
to
help
him
observed
beatrice
tranquilly
lady
torridon
looked
at
her
again
even
now
she
could
scarcely
believe
that
this
stranger
could
treat
her
with
such
a
supreme
indifference
and
there
was
a
further
sting
too
in
the
girl
answer
for
all
there
understood
the
reference
to
ralph
and
yet
again
it
was
impossible
to
take
offence
margaret
looked
at
her
father
and
saw
again
a
look
of
anxiety
in
his
eyes
he
was
crumbling
his
bread
nervously
as
he
answered
beatrice
my
lord
cromwell
he
began
my
lord
cromwell
has
my
son
ralph
under
him
interrupted
his
wife
perhaps
you
did
not
know
that
mistress
atherton
margaret
again
looked
quickly
up
but
there
was
still
no
sign
of
wincing
on
those
scarlet
lips
or
beneath
the
black
eyebrows
why
of
course
i
knew
it
said
beatrice
looking
straight
at
her
with
large
innocent
eyes
that
was
why
she
stopped
and
lady
torridon
really
roused
now
made
a
false
step
yes
she
said
you
did
not
end
your
sentence
beatrice
cast
an
ironically
despairing
look
behind
her
at
the
servants
well
she
said
if
you
will
have
it
that
was
why
i
would
not
marry
him
did
you
not
know
that
mistress
it
was
so
daring
that
margaret
caught
her
breath
suddenly
and
looked
hopelessly
round
her
father
and
brother
had
their
eyes
steadily
bent
on
the
table
and
the
priest
was
looking
oddly
at
the
quiet
angry
woman
opposite
him
then
sir
james
slid
deftly
in
after
a
sufficient
pause
to
let
the
lesson
sink
home
and
began
to
talk
of
indifferent
things
and
beatrice
answered
him
with
the
same
ease
lady
torridon
made
one
more
attempt
just
before
the
end
of
supper
when
the
servants
had
left
the
room
you
are
living
on
she
corrected
herself
ostentatiously
you
are
living
with
any
other
family
now
mistress
atherton
i
remember
my
son
ralph
telling
me
you
were
almost
one
of
master
more
household
beatrice
met
her
eyes
with
a
delightful
smile
i
am
living
on
with
your
family
at
this
time
mistress
torridon
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
just
then
the
girl
had
not
only
turned
her
hostess
point
but
had
pricked
her
shrewdly
in
riposte
three
times
and
the
last
was
the
sharpest
of
all
lady
torridon
led
the
way
to
the
oak
parlour
in
silence
she
made
no
more
assaults
that
night
but
sat
in
dignified
aloofness
her
hands
on
her
lap
with
an
air
of
being
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
the
others
beatrice
sat
with
margaret
on
the
long
oak
settle
and
talked
genially
to
the
company
at
large
when
compline
had
been
said
sir
james
drew
chris
aside
into
the
court
as
the
others
went
on
in
front
dear
lad
he
said
what
are
we
to
do
this
can
not
go
on
your
mother
chris
smiled
at
him
and
took
his
arm
a
moment
why
father
he
said
what
more
do
we
want
mistress
atherton
can
hold
her
own
but
your
mother
will
insult
her
she
will
not
be
able
said
chris
mistress
atherton
will
not
have
it
did
you
not
see
how
she
enjoyed
it
enjoyed
it
why
yes
her
eyes
shone
well
i
must
speak
to
her
said
sir
james
still
perplexed
come
with
me
chris
carleton
was
just
leaving
the
parlour
as
they
came
up
to
its
outside
door
sir
james
drew
him
into
the
yard
there
were
no
secrets
between
these
two
father
he
said
did
you
notice
do
you
think
mistress
atherton
will
be
able
to
stay
here
he
saw
to
his
astonishment
that
the
priest
melancholy
face
as
the
starlight
fell
on
it
was
smiling
why
yes
sir
james
she
is
happy
enough
but
my
wife
sir
james
i
think
mistress
atherton
may
do
her
good
she
he
hesitated
well
said
the
old
man
she
lady
torridon
has
met
her
match
said
the
chaplain
still
smiling
sir
james
made
a
little
gesture
of
bewilderment
well
come
in
chris
i
do
not
understand
but
if
you
both
think
so
he
broke
off
and
opened
the
door
lady
torridon
was
gone
to
her
room
and
the
two
girls
were
alone
beatrice
was
standing
before
the
hearth
with
her
hands
behind
her
back
a
gallant
upright
figure
as
they
came
in
she
turned
a
cheerful
face
to
them
your
daughter
has
been
apologising
sir
james
she
said
and
there
was
a
ripple
of
amusement
in
her
voice
she
thinks
i
have
been
hardly
treated
she
glanced
at
the
bewildered
margaret
who
was
staring
at
her
under
her
delicate
eyebrows
with
wide
eyes
of
amazement
and
admiration
sir
james
looked
confused
the
truth
is
mistress
atherton
that
i
too
and
my
son
well
not
your
son
said
chris
smiling
you
too
cried
beatrice
and
how
have
i
been
hardly
treated
well
i
thought
perhaps
that
what
was
said
at
supper
began
the
old
man
beginning
to
smile
too
lady
torridon
and
every
one
has
been
all
that
is
hospitable
said
beatrice
it
is
like
old
days
at
chelsea
i
love
and
there
are
so
few
who
practise
it
sir
james
was
still
a
little
perplexed
you
assure
me
mistress
that
you
are
not
distressed
by
by
anything
that
has
passed
distressed
she
cried
why
it
is
a
real
happiness
but
he
was
not
yet
satisfied
you
will
engage
to
tell
me
then
if
you
think
you
are
improperly
treated
by
by
anyone
why
yes
said
the
girl
smiling
into
his
eyes
but
there
is
no
need
to
promise
that
i
am
really
happy
and
i
am
sure
your
daughter
and
i
will
be
good
friends
she
turned
a
little
towards
margaret
and
chris
saw
a
curious
emotion
of
awe
and
astonishment
and
affection
in
his
sister
eyes
come
my
dear
said
beatrice
you
said
you
would
take
me
to
my
room
sir
james
hastened
to
push
open
the
further
door
that
led
to
the
stairs
and
the
two
girls
passed
out
together
then
he
shut
the
door
and
turned
to
his
son
chris
had
begun
to
laugh
chapter
iii
a
it
was
a
very
strange
household
that
christmas
at
overfield
mary
and
her
husband
came
over
with
their
child
and
the
entire
party
with
the
exception
of
the
duellists
themselves
settled
down
to
watch
the
conflict
between
lady
torridon
and
beatrice
atherton
its
prolongation
was
possible
because
for
days
together
the
hostess
retired
into
a
fortress
of
silence
whence
she
looked
out
cynically
shrugged
her
shoulders
smiled
almost
imperceptibly
and
only
sallied
when
she
found
she
could
not
provoke
an
attack
beatrice
never
made
an
assault
was
always
ready
for
the
least
hint
of
peace
but
guarded
deftly
and
struck
hard
when
she
was
directly
threatened
neither
would
she
ever
take
an
insult
the
bitterest
dart
fell
innocuous
on
her
bright
shield
before
she
struck
back
smiling
but
there
were
some
sharp
moments
of
anxiety
now
and
again
as
she
hesitated
how
to
guard
a
silence
would
fall
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
the
talk
and
clatter
at
table
there
would
be
a
momentary
kindling
of
glances
as
from
the
tall
chair
opposite
the
chaplain
a
psychological
atmosphere
of
peril
made
itself
felt
then
the
blow
would
be
delivered
the
weapons
clashed
and
once
more
the
talk
rose
high
and
genial
over
the
battlefield
the
moment
when
beatrice
position
in
the
house
came
nearest
to
being
untenable
was
one
morning
in
january
when
the
whole
party
were
assembled
on
the
steps
to
see
the
sportsmen
off
for
the
day
sir
james
was
down
with
the
foresters
and
hounds
at
the
further
end
of
the
terrace
arranging
the
details
of
the
day
margaret
had
not
yet
come
out
of
chapel
and
lady
torridon
who
had
had
a
long
fit
of
silence
was
standing
with
mary
and
nicholas
at
the
head
of
the
central
stairs
that
led
down
from
the
terrace
to
the
gravel
christopher
and
beatrice
came
out
of
the
house
behind
talking
cheerfully
for
the
two
had
become
great
friends
since
they
had
learnt
to
understand
one
another
and
beatrice
had
confessed
to
him
frankly
that
she
had
been
wrong
and
he
right
in
the
matter
of
ralph
she
had
told
him
this
a
couple
of
days
after
her
arrival
but
there
had
been
a
certain
constraint
in
her
manner
that
forbade
his
saying
much
in
answer
here
they
came
then
now
in
the
frosty
sunshine
he
in
his
habit
and
she
in
her
morning
of
silk
and
lace
talking
briskly
i
was
sure
you
would
understand
father
she
said
as
they
came
up
behind
the
group
then
lady
torridon
turned
and
delivered
her
point
suddenly
and
brutally
of
course
he
will
she
said
i
suppose
then
you
are
not
going
out
mistress
atherton
and
she
glanced
with
an
offensive
contempt
at
the
girl
and
the
monk
beatrice
eyes
narrowed
almost
imperceptibly
and
opened
again
why
no
lady
torridon
i
thought
not
said
the
other
and
again
she
glanced
at
the
two
for
i
see
the
priest
is
not
there
was
a
moment
silence
nick
was
looking
at
his
wife
with
a
face
of
dismay
then
beatrice
answered
smiling
neither
are
you
dear
lady
torridon
is
not
that
enough
to
keep
me
a
short
yelp
of
laughter
broke
from
nicholas
and
he
stooped
to
examine
his
boot
lady
torridon
opened
her
lips
closed
them
again
and
turned
her
back
on
the
girl
but
you
are
cruel
said
beatrice
voice
from
behind
and
the
woman
turned
once
more
venomously
you
do
not
want
me
she
said
you
have
taken
one
son
of
mine
and
now
you
would
take
the
other
is
not
my
daughter
enough
beatrice
instantly
stepped
up
and
put
her
hand
on
the
other
arm
dear
mistress
she
said
and
her
voice
broke
into
tenderness
she
is
not
enough
lady
torridon
jerked
her
arm
away
come
mary
she
said
matters
were
a
little
better
after
that
sir
james
was
not
told
of
the
incident
because
his
son
knew
very
well
that
he
would
not
allow
beatrice
to
stay
another
day
after
the
insult
but
chris
felt
himself
bound
to
consult
those
who
had
heard
what
had
passed
as
to
whether
indeed
it
was
possible
for
her
to
remain
nicholas
grew
crimson
with
indignation
and
vowed
it
was
impossible
mary
hesitated
and
chris
himself
was
doubtful
he
went
at
last
to
beatrice
that
same
evening
and
found
her
alone
in
the
oak
parlour
before
supper
the
sportsmen
had
not
yet
come
back
and
the
other
ladies
were
upstairs
beatrice
affected
to
treat
it
as
nothing
and
it
was
not
till
chris
threatened
to
tell
his
father
that
she
told
him
all
she
thought
i
must
seem
a
vain
fool
to
say
so
she
said
leaning
back
in
her
chair
and
looking
up
at
him
and
perhaps
insolent
too
yet
i
must
say
it
it
is
this
i
believe
that
lady
torridon
ah
how
can
i
say
it
tell
me
said
chris
steadily
looking
away
from
her
beatrice
shifted
a
little
in
her
seat
and
then
stood
up
well
it
is
this
i
do
not
believe
your
mother
is
so
so
is
what
she
sometimes
seems
i
think
she
is
very
sore
and
angry
there
are
a
hundred
reasons
i
think
no
one
has
has
faced
her
before
she
has
been
obeyed
too
much
and
and
i
think
that
if
i
stay
i
may
be
able
i
may
be
some
good
she
ended
lamely
chris
nodded
i
understand
he
said
softly
give
me
another
week
or
two
said
beatrice
i
will
do
my
best
you
have
worked
a
miracle
with
meg
said
chris
i
believe
you
can
work
another
i
will
not
tell
my
father
and
the
others
shall
not
either
a
wonderful
change
had
indeed
come
to
margaret
during
the
last
month
her
whole
soul
so
cramped
now
by
circumstances
had
gone
out
in
adoration
towards
this
stranger
chris
found
it
almost
piteous
to
watch
her
her
shy
looks
the
shiver
that
went
over
her
when
the
brilliant
figure
rustled
into
the
room
or
the
brisk
sentences
were
delivered
from
those
smiling
lips
he
would
see
too
how
their
hands
met
as
they
sat
together
how
margaret
would
sit
distracted
and
hungering
for
attention
eyeing
the
ceiling
the
carpet
her
embroidery
and
how
her
eyes
would
leap
to
meet
a
glance
and
her
face
flush
up
as
beatrice
throw
her
a
soft
word
or
look
and
it
was
the
right
love
too
to
the
monk
eyes
not
a
rival
flame
but
fuel
for
divine
ardour
margaret
spent
longer
not
shorter
time
at
her
prayers
was
more
not
less
devout
at
mass
and
communion
and
her
whole
sore
soul
became
sensitive
and
alive
again
the
winter
had
passed
for
her
the
time
of
the
was
come
she
was
fascinated
by
the
other
gallant
brilliance
religion
for
the
nun
had
up
to
the
present
appeared
a
delicate
thing
that
grew
in
the
shadow
or
in
the
warm
shelter
of
the
cloister
now
it
blossomed
out
in
beatrice
as
a
hardy
bright
plant
that
tossed
its
leaves
in
the
wind
and
exulted
in
sun
and
cold
yet
it
had
its
evening
tendernesses
too
its
subtle
fragrance
when
the
breeze
fell
its
sweet
colours
and
outlines
beatrice
too
could
pray
and
margaret
spiritual
instinct
as
she
knelt
by
her
at
the
or
glanced
at
the
other
face
as
she
came
down
fresh
with
absolution
from
the
chair
in
the
sanctuary
where
the
chaplain
sat
detected
a
glow
of
faith
at
least
as
warm
as
her
own
she
was
astonished
too
at
her
friend
gaiety
for
she
had
expected
so
far
as
her
knowledge
of
human
souls
led
to
expect
anything
a
quiet
convalescent
spirit
recovering
but
slowly
from
the
tragedy
through
which
margaret
knew
she
had
passed
it
seemed
to
her
at
first
as
if
beatrice
must
be
almost
heartless
so
little
did
she
flinch
when
lady
torridon
darted
ralph
name
at
her
or
master
more
or
flicked
her
suddenly
where
the
wound
ought
to
be
and
it
was
not
until
the
guest
had
been
a
month
in
the
house
that
the
nun
understood
they
were
together
one
evening
in
margaret
own
white
little
room
above
the
oak
parlour
beatrice
was
sitting
before
the
fire
with
her
arms
clasped
behind
her
head
waiting
till
the
other
had
finished
her
office
and
looking
round
pleased
in
her
heart
at
the
walls
that
told
their
tale
so
plainly
it
was
almost
exactly
like
a
cell
a
low
oak
bed
stood
under
the
sloping
roof
a
beside
it
and
a
cheap
little
french
image
of
scholastica
over
it
there
was
a
table
with
a
sheet
of
white
paper
a
little
and
two
quills
primly
side
by
side
upon
it
and
at
the
back
stood
a
couple
of
small
bound
volumes
in
which
the
nun
was
accumulating
little
by
little
private
devotions
that
appealed
to
her
a
pair
of
beads
hung
on
a
nail
by
the
window
over
which
was
drawn
an
old
red
curtain
two
brass
candlesticks
with
a
cross
between
them
stood
over
the
hearth
giving
it
a
faint
resemblance
to
an
altar
the
boards
were
bare
except
for
a
strip
of
matting
by
the
bed
and
the
whole
room
walls
floor
ceiling
and
furniture
were
speckless
and
precise
margaret
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
closed
her
book
and
smiled
at
beatrice
you
dear
child
she
answered
margaret
face
shone
with
pleasure
and
she
put
out
her
hand
softly
to
the
other
knee
and
laid
it
there
talk
to
me
said
the
nun
well
said
beatrice
tell
me
about
your
life
in
london
you
never
have
yet
you
know
an
odd
look
passed
over
the
other
face
and
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
laid
her
hands
together
in
her
lap
oh
meg
she
said
i
should
love
to
tell
you
if
i
could
what
would
you
like
to
hear
the
nun
looked
at
her
wondering
why
everything
she
said
shall
i
tell
you
of
chelsea
and
master
more
margaret
nodded
still
looking
at
her
and
beatrice
began
it
was
an
extraordinary
experience
for
the
nun
to
sit
there
and
hear
that
wonderful
tale
poured
out
beatrice
for
the
first
time
threw
open
her
defences
those
protections
of
the
sensitive
inner
life
that
she
had
raised
by
sheer
will
and
showed
her
heart
she
told
her
first
of
her
life
in
the
country
before
she
had
known
anything
of
the
world
of
her
father
friendship
with
more
when
she
was
still
a
child
and
of
his
death
when
she
was
about
sixteen
she
had
had
money
of
her
own
and
had
come
up
to
live
with
more
sisters
and
so
had
gradually
slipped
into
intimacy
at
chelsea
then
she
described
the
life
there
the
ordered
beauty
of
it
all
and
the
marvellous
soul
that
was
its
centre
and
sun
she
told
her
of
more
humour
his
unfailing
gaiety
his
sweet
cynicism
that
shot
through
his
talk
his
tender
affections
and
above
all
for
she
knew
this
would
most
interest
the
nun
his
deep
and
resolute
devotion
to
god
she
described
how
he
had
at
one
time
lived
at
the
charterhouse
and
had
seemed
to
regret
before
the
end
of
his
life
that
he
had
not
become
a
carthusian
she
told
her
of
the
precious
parcel
that
had
been
sent
from
the
tower
to
chelsea
the
day
before
his
death
and
how
she
had
helped
margaret
roper
to
unfasten
it
and
disclose
the
that
he
had
worn
secretly
for
years
and
which
now
he
had
sent
back
for
fear
that
it
should
be
seen
by
unfriendly
eyes
or
praised
by
flattering
tongues
her
face
grew
inexpressibly
soft
and
loving
as
she
talked
more
than
once
her
black
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
her
voice
faltered
and
the
nun
sat
almost
terrified
at
the
emotion
she
had
called
up
it
was
hardly
possible
that
this
tender
feminine
creature
who
talked
so
softly
of
divine
and
human
things
and
of
the
strange
ardent
lawyer
in
whom
both
were
so
manifest
could
be
the
same
stately
lady
of
downstairs
who
fenced
so
gallantly
who
never
winced
at
a
wound
and
trod
so
bravely
over
sharp
perilous
ground
they
killed
him
said
beatrice
king
henry
killed
him
for
that
he
could
not
bear
an
honest
kindly
holy
soul
so
near
his
own
and
we
are
left
to
weep
for
him
of
whom
of
whom
the
world
was
not
worthy
margaret
felt
her
hand
caught
and
caressed
and
the
two
sat
in
silence
a
moment
but
but
began
the
nun
softly
bewildered
by
this
revelation
yes
my
dear
you
did
not
know
how
should
you
what
a
wound
i
carry
here
what
a
wound
we
all
carry
who
knew
him
again
there
was
a
short
silence
margaret
was
searching
for
some
word
of
comfort
but
you
did
what
you
could
for
him
did
you
not
and
and
even
ralph
i
think
i
heard
beatrice
turned
and
looked
at
her
steadily
margaret
read
in
her
face
something
she
could
not
understand
yes
ralph
said
beatrice
questioningly
you
told
father
so
did
you
not
he
did
what
he
could
for
master
more
beatrice
laid
her
other
hand
too
over
margaret
my
dear
i
do
not
know
i
can
not
speak
of
that
but
you
said
margaret
my
pet
you
would
not
hurt
me
would
you
i
do
not
think
i
can
bear
to
speak
of
that
the
nun
gripped
the
other
two
hands
passionately
and
laid
her
cheek
against
them
beatrice
i
did
not
know
i
forgot
beatrice
stooped
and
kissed
her
gently
the
nun
loved
her
tenfold
more
after
that
it
had
been
before
a
kind
of
passionate
admiration
such
as
a
subject
might
feel
for
a
splendid
queen
but
the
queen
had
taken
this
timid
soul
in
through
the
now
into
a
little
inner
chamber
intimate
and
apart
and
had
sat
with
her
there
and
shown
her
everything
her
broken
toys
her
failures
and
more
than
all
her
own
broken
heart
and
as
after
that
evening
margaret
watched
beatrice
again
in
public
heard
her
retorts
and
marked
her
bearing
she
knew
that
she
knew
something
that
the
others
did
not
she
had
the
joy
of
sharing
a
secret
of
pain
but
there
was
one
wound
that
beatrice
did
not
show
her
that
secret
was
reserved
for
one
who
had
more
claim
to
it
and
could
understand
the
nun
could
not
have
interpreted
it
rightly
mary
and
nicholas
went
back
to
great
keynes
at
the
end
of
january
and
beatrice
was
out
on
the
terrace
with
the
others
to
see
them
go
jim
the
little
boy
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
ever
since
he
had
found
that
she
treated
him
like
a
man
with
deference
and
courtesy
and
did
not
talk
about
him
in
his
presence
and
over
his
head
he
was
walking
with
her
now
a
little
apart
as
the
horses
came
round
and
explaining
to
her
how
it
was
that
he
only
rode
a
pony
at
present
and
not
a
horse
my
legs
would
not
reach
mistress
atherton
he
said
protruding
a
small
leather
boot
it
is
not
because
i
am
afraid
or
father
either
i
rode
jess
the
other
day
but
not
astride
i
quite
understand
said
beatrice
respectfully
without
the
shadow
of
laughter
in
her
face
you
see
began
the
boy
then
his
mother
came
up
run
jim
and
hold
my
horse
mistress
beatrice
may
i
have
a
word
with
you
the
two
turned
and
walked
down
to
the
end
of
the
terrace
again
it
is
this
said
mary
looking
at
the
other
from
under
her
plumed
hat
with
her
skirt
gathered
up
with
her
whip
in
her
gloved
hand
i
wished
to
tell
you
about
my
mother
i
have
not
dared
till
now
i
have
never
seen
her
so
stirred
in
my
life
as
she
is
now
i
i
think
she
will
do
anything
you
wish
in
time
it
is
useless
to
feign
that
we
do
not
understand
one
another
anything
you
wish
come
back
to
her
faith
perhaps
treat
my
father
better
she
she
loves
you
i
think
and
yet
dare
not
on
ralph
account
put
in
beatrice
serenely
yes
how
did
you
know
it
is
on
ralph
account
she
can
not
forgive
that
can
you
say
anything
to
her
do
you
think
anything
to
explain
you
understand
i
understand
i
do
not
know
how
i
dare
say
all
this
went
on
mary
blushing
furiously
but
i
must
thank
you
too
for
what
you
have
done
for
my
sister
it
is
wonderful
i
could
have
done
nothing
my
dear
said
beatrice
i
love
your
sister
there
is
no
need
for
thanks
a
loud
voice
hailed
them
sweetheart
shouted
sir
nicholas
standing
with
his
legs
apart
at
the
mounting
steps
the
horses
are
fretted
to
death
you
will
remember
said
mary
hurriedly
as
they
turned
and
god
bless
you
beatrice
lady
torridon
was
indeed
very
quiet
now
it
was
strange
for
the
others
to
see
the
difference
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
been
conquered
by
the
one
weapon
that
she
could
wield
which
was
brutality
as
carleton
had
said
she
had
never
been
faced
before
she
had
been
accustomed
to
regard
devoutness
as
incompatible
with
strong
character
she
had
never
been
resisted
both
her
husband
and
children
had
thought
to
conquer
by
yielding
it
was
easier
to
do
so
and
appeared
more
christian
and
she
herself
like
ralph
was
only
provoked
further
by
passivity
and
now
she
had
met
one
of
the
old
school
who
was
as
ready
in
the
use
of
worldly
weapons
as
herself
she
had
been
ignored
and
pricked
alternately
and
with
astonishing
grace
too
by
one
who
was
certainly
of
that
tone
of
mind
that
she
had
gradually
learnt
to
despise
and
hate
chris
saw
this
before
his
father
but
he
saw
too
that
the
conquest
was
not
yet
complete
his
mother
had
been
cowed
with
respect
as
a
dog
that
is
broken
in
she
had
not
yet
been
melted
with
love
he
had
spoken
to
mary
the
day
before
the
maxwells
departure
and
tried
to
put
this
into
words
and
mary
had
seen
where
the
opening
for
love
lay
through
which
the
work
could
be
done
and
the
result
had
been
the
interview
with
beatrice
and
the
mention
of
ralph
name
but
mary
had
not
a
notion
how
beatrice
could
act
she
only
saw
that
ralph
was
the
one
chink
in
her
mother
armour
and
she
left
it
to
this
girl
who
had
been
so
adroit
up
to
the
present
to
find
how
to
pierce
it
sir
james
had
given
up
trying
to
understand
the
situation
he
had
for
so
long
regarded
his
wife
as
an
irreconcilable
that
he
hoped
for
nothing
better
than
to
be
able
to
keep
her
pacified
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
conversion
seemed
an
idle
dream
but
he
had
noticed
the
change
in
her
manner
and
wondered
what
it
meant
he
hoped
that
the
pendulum
had
not
swung
too
far
and
that
it
was
not
she
who
was
being
bullied
now
by
this
imperious
girl
from
town
he
said
a
word
to
carleton
one
day
about
it
as
they
walked
in
the
garden
father
he
said
i
am
puzzled
what
has
come
to
my
wife
have
you
not
noticed
how
she
has
not
spoken
for
three
days
do
you
think
she
dislikes
mistress
atherton
if
i
thought
that
no
sir
said
the
priest
i
do
not
think
it
is
that
i
think
it
is
the
other
way
about
she
did
dislike
her
but
not
now
you
do
not
think
mistress
atherton
is
is
a
little
discourteous
and
sharp
sometimes
i
have
wondered
whether
that
was
so
chris
thinks
not
however
neither
do
i
sir
i
think
i
think
it
is
all
very
well
as
it
is
i
hope
mistress
atherton
is
to
stay
yet
a
while
she
speaks
of
going
in
a
week
or
two
said
the
old
man
she
has
been
here
six
weeks
now
i
hope
not
said
the
priest
since
you
have
asked
my
opinion
sir
sir
james
sighed
looked
at
the
other
and
then
left
him
to
search
for
his
wife
and
see
if
she
wanted
him
he
was
feeling
a
little
sorry
for
her
a
week
later
the
truth
began
to
come
out
and
beatrice
had
the
opportunity
for
which
she
was
waiting
they
were
all
gathered
before
the
expecting
supper
the
painted
windows
had
died
with
the
daylight
and
the
deep
tones
of
the
woodwork
in
gallery
and
floor
and
walls
had
crept
out
from
the
gloom
into
the
dancing
flare
of
the
fire
and
the
steady
glow
of
the
sconces
the
weather
had
broken
a
day
or
two
before
all
the
afternoon
sheets
of
rain
had
swept
across
the
fields
and
gardens
and
heavy
cheerless
clouds
marched
over
the
sky
the
wind
was
shrilling
now
against
the
north
side
of
the
hall
and
one
window
dripped
a
little
inside
on
to
the
matting
below
it
the
shone
with
silver
and
crockery
and
the
napkins
by
each
place
and
the
door
from
the
kitchen
was
set
wide
for
the
passage
of
the
servants
one
of
whom
waited
discreetly
in
the
opening
for
the
coming
of
the
lady
of
the
house
they
were
all
there
but
she
and
the
minutes
went
by
and
she
did
not
come
sir
james
turned
enquiringly
as
the
door
from
the
court
opened
but
it
was
only
a
wet
shivering
dog
who
had
nosed
it
open
and
now
crept
deprecatingly
towards
the
blaze
you
poor
beast
said
beatrice
drawing
her
skirts
aside
take
my
place
and
she
stepped
away
to
allow
him
to
come
he
looked
gratefully
up
wagged
his
and
lay
down
comfortably
at
the
edge
of
the
tiles
my
wife
is
very
late
said
sir
james
chris
he
stopped
as
footsteps
sounded
in
the
flagged
passage
leading
from
the
living
rooms
and
the
next
moment
the
door
was
flung
open
and
a
woman
ran
forward
with
outstretched
hands
o
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
she
cried
my
lady
is
come
sir
come
chapter
iv
the
elder
son
ralph
had
prospered
exceedingly
since
his
return
from
the
sussex
visitation
he
had
been
sent
on
mission
after
mission
by
cromwell
who
had
learnt
at
last
how
wholly
he
could
be
trusted
and
with
each
success
his
reputation
increased
it
seemed
to
cromwell
that
his
man
was
more
than
he
had
been
at
first
and
when
he
was
told
abruptly
by
ralph
that
his
relations
with
mistress
atherton
had
come
to
an
end
the
politician
was
not
slow
to
connect
cause
and
effect
he
had
always
regretted
the
friendship
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
servant
character
was
sure
to
be
weakened
by
his
alliance
with
a
friend
of
master
more
and
though
he
had
said
nothing
for
ralph
manner
did
not
encourage
questions
he
had
secretly
congratulated
both
himself
and
his
agent
for
so
happy
a
termination
to
an
unfortunate
incident
for
the
meantime
ralph
fortunes
rose
with
his
master
lord
cromwell
now
reigned
in
england
next
after
the
king
in
both
church
and
state
he
held
a
number
of
offices
each
of
which
would
have
been
sufficient
for
an
ordinary
man
but
all
of
which
did
not
overtax
his
amazing
energy
he
stood
absolutely
alone
with
all
the
power
in
his
hands
president
of
the
star
chamber
foreign
minister
and
the
of
the
church
feared
by
churchmen
distrusted
by
statesmen
and
nobles
and
hated
by
all
except
his
own
few
personal
friends
an
unique
figure
that
had
grown
to
gigantic
stature
through
sheer
effort
and
adroitness
and
beneath
his
formidable
shadow
ralph
was
waxing
great
he
had
failed
to
get
lewes
for
himself
for
cromwell
designed
it
for
gregory
his
son
but
he
was
offered
his
choice
among
several
other
great
houses
for
the
present
he
hesitated
to
choose
uncertain
of
his
future
if
his
father
died
there
would
be
overfield
waiting
for
him
so
he
did
not
wish
to
tie
himself
to
one
of
the
yorkshire
houses
if
his
father
lived
he
did
not
wish
to
be
too
near
him
there
was
no
hurry
said
cromwell
there
would
be
houses
and
to
spare
for
the
king
faithful
servants
and
meantime
it
would
be
better
for
torridon
to
remain
in
westminster
and
lay
his
foundations
of
prosperity
deeper
and
wider
yet
before
building
the
title
too
that
cromwell
dangled
before
him
sometimes
that
too
could
wait
until
he
had
chosen
his
place
of
abode
ralph
felt
that
he
was
being
magnificently
treated
by
his
master
and
his
gratitude
and
admiration
grew
side
by
side
with
his
rising
fortune
there
was
no
niggardliness
now
that
cromwell
had
learnt
to
trust
in
him
he
could
draw
as
much
money
as
he
wished
for
the
payment
of
his
or
for
any
other
purpose
and
no
questions
were
asked
the
little
house
at
westminster
grew
rich
in
treasures
his
was
the
very
cope
he
had
taken
from
rusper
his
table
was
heavy
with
chalices
beaten
into
secular
shape
his
was
a
spanish
chasuble
taken
in
the
north
his
servants
were
no
longer
three
or
four
sleeping
in
the
house
there
was
a
brigade
of
them
some
that
attended
for
orders
morning
by
morning
some
that
skirmished
for
him
in
the
country
and
returned
rich
in
documents
and
hearsay
and
a
dozen
waited
on
his
personal
wants
he
dealt
too
with
great
folks
half
a
dozen
abbots
had
been
to
see
him
in
the
last
year
or
two
stately
prelates
that
treated
him
as
an
equal
and
pleaded
for
his
intercession
the
great
nobles
enemies
of
his
master
and
himself
eyed
him
with
respectful
suspicion
as
he
walked
with
cromwell
in
westminster
hall
the
king
had
pulled
his
ears
and
praised
him
ralph
had
stayed
at
greenwich
a
week
at
a
time
when
the
execution
of
the
benedictine
abbots
was
under
discussion
he
had
ridden
down
cheapside
with
henry
on
his
right
and
cromwell
beyond
between
the
shouting
crowds
and
beneath
the
wild
tossing
of
and
tapestry
and
the
windy
pealing
of
a
hundred
brazen
bells
he
had
gone
up
with
norfolk
to
doncaster
a
mouth
through
which
the
king
might
promise
and
threaten
and
had
strode
up
the
steps
beside
the
duke
to
make
an
end
of
the
of
the
northern
rebellion
he
did
not
lack
a
goad
beside
that
of
his
own
ambition
to
drive
him
through
this
desperate
stir
he
found
a
sufficient
one
in
his
memory
he
did
not
think
much
of
his
own
family
except
with
sharp
contempt
he
did
not
even
trouble
to
make
any
special
report
about
chris
or
margaret
but
it
was
impossible
to
remember
beatrice
with
contempt
when
she
had
left
him
kneeling
at
his
table
she
had
left
something
besides
the
sting
of
her
words
and
the
bitter
coldness
of
her
eyes
as
he
looked
back
he
did
not
know
whether
he
loathed
her
or
loved
her
he
only
knew
that
she
affected
him
profoundly
again
and
again
as
he
dealt
brutally
with
some
timid
culprit
or
stood
with
his
hand
on
his
hip
to
direct
the
destruction
of
a
shrine
the
memory
whipped
him
on
his
raw
soul
he
would
show
her
whether
he
were
a
man
or
no
whether
he
depended
on
her
or
no
whether
her
woman
tongue
could
turn
him
or
no
he
was
exercised
now
with
very
different
matters
religious
affairs
for
the
present
had
fallen
into
a
secondary
place
and
home
and
foreign
politics
absorbed
most
of
cromwell
energies
and
time
forces
were
gathering
once
more
against
england
and
the
catholic
powers
were
coming
to
an
understanding
with
one
another
against
the
country
that
had
thrown
off
allegiance
to
the
pope
and
the
empire
there
was
an
opportunity
however
for
henry
propensity
to
marriage
once
more
to
play
a
part
in
politics
he
had
been
three
years
without
a
wife
and
cromwell
had
hastened
for
the
third
time
to
avail
himself
of
the
king
passions
as
an
instrument
in
politics
he
had
understood
that
a
union
between
england
and
the
lutheran
princes
would
cause
a
formidable
obstacle
to
catholic
machinations
and
with
this
in
view
had
excited
henry
by
a
description
and
a
picture
of
the
lady
anne
daughter
of
the
duke
of
cleves
and
of
the
elector
of
saxony
he
had
been
perfectly
successful
in
the
first
stages
the
stout
duchess
had
landed
at
deal
at
the
end
of
december
and
the
marriage
had
been
solemnised
a
few
days
later
but
unpleasant
rumour
had
been
busy
ever
since
it
was
whispered
far
and
wide
that
the
king
loathed
his
wife
and
complained
that
he
had
been
deceived
as
to
her
charms
and
ralph
who
was
more
behind
the
scenes
than
most
men
knew
that
the
rumour
was
only
too
true
he
had
been
present
at
an
abominable
incident
the
day
after
the
marriage
had
taken
place
when
the
king
had
stormed
and
raved
about
the
crying
out
that
he
had
been
deceived
and
adding
many
gross
details
for
the
benefit
of
his
friends
cromwell
had
been
strangely
moody
ever
since
ralph
had
watched
his
heavy
face
day
after
day
staring
vacantly
across
the
room
and
his
hand
that
held
the
pen
dig
and
prick
at
the
paper
beneath
it
even
that
was
not
all
the
alliance
had
provoked
opposition
on
the
continent
instead
of
quelling
it
and
ralph
saw
more
than
one
threatening
piece
of
news
from
abroad
that
hinted
at
a
probable
invasion
of
england
should
cromwell
schemes
take
effect
these
too
however
had
proved
deceptive
and
the
lutheran
princes
whom
he
had
desired
to
conciliate
were
even
already
beginning
to
draw
back
from
the
consequences
of
their
action
ralph
was
in
cromwell
room
one
day
towards
the
end
of
january
when
a
courier
arrived
with
despatches
from
an
agent
who
had
been
following
the
spanish
emperor
pacific
progress
through
france
undertaken
as
a
kind
of
demonstration
against
england
cromwell
tore
open
the
papers
and
glanced
at
them
running
his
quick
attentive
eye
over
this
page
and
that
and
ralph
saw
his
face
grow
stern
and
white
he
tossed
the
papers
on
to
the
table
and
nodded
to
the
courier
to
leave
the
room
then
he
took
up
a
pen
examined
it
dashed
it
point
down
against
the
table
gnawed
his
nails
a
moment
and
then
caught
ralph
eye
we
are
failing
he
said
abruptly
torridon
if
you
are
a
rat
you
had
better
run
i
shall
not
run
sir
said
ralph
god
body
said
his
master
we
shall
all
run
together
i
think
but
not
yet
then
he
took
up
the
papers
again
and
began
to
read
it
was
a
few
days
later
that
ralph
received
the
news
of
his
illness
she
had
written
to
him
occasionally
telling
him
of
his
tiresome
ways
his
brother
arrogance
his
sister
feeble
piety
and
finally
she
had
told
him
of
beatrice
arrival
i
consented
very
gladly
she
had
written
for
i
thought
to
teach
my
lady
a
lesson
or
two
but
i
find
her
very
pert
and
obstinate
i
do
not
understand
my
dear
son
how
you
could
have
wished
to
make
her
your
wife
and
yet
i
will
grant
that
she
has
a
taking
way
with
her
she
seems
to
fear
nothing
but
her
own
superstitions
and
folly
but
i
am
very
happy
to
think
that
all
is
over
between
you
she
never
loved
you
my
ralph
for
she
cares
nothing
when
i
speak
your
name
as
i
have
done
two
or
three
times
nor
yet
master
more
either
i
think
she
has
no
heart
ralph
had
wondered
a
little
as
he
read
this
at
his
mother
curious
interest
in
the
girl
and
he
wondered
too
at
the
report
of
callousness
it
was
her
damned
pride
he
assured
himself
then
one
evening
as
he
arrived
home
from
hackney
where
he
had
slept
the
previous
night
he
found
a
messenger
waiting
for
him
the
letter
had
not
been
sent
on
to
him
as
he
had
not
left
word
where
he
was
going
it
contained
a
single
line
from
his
father
your
mother
is
come
at
once
she
wishes
for
you
it
was
in
the
stormy
blackness
of
a
february
midnight
that
he
rode
up
through
the
lighted
gatehouse
to
his
home
above
the
terrace
as
he
came
up
the
road
the
tall
glimmered
faintly
like
a
gigantic
luminous
door
hung
in
space
and
the
lower
window
of
his
father
room
shone
and
faded
as
the
fire
leapt
within
a
figure
rose
up
suddenly
from
before
the
as
he
came
in
bringing
with
him
a
fierce
gust
of
wet
wind
through
the
opened
door
and
when
he
had
slipped
off
his
dripping
cloak
into
his
servant
hands
he
saw
that
his
father
was
there
two
yards
away
very
stern
and
white
with
outstretched
hands
my
son
said
the
old
man
you
are
too
late
she
died
two
hours
ago
it
was
a
fierce
shock
and
for
a
moment
he
stood
dazed
blinking
at
the
light
holding
his
father
warm
slender
hands
in
his
own
and
trying
to
assimilate
the
news
he
had
been
driven
inwards
and
his
obstinacy
weakened
during
that
long
ride
from
town
through
the
stormy
sunset
into
the
black
howling
night
memories
had
reasserted
themselves
on
the
strength
of
his
anxiety
and
the
past
year
or
two
slipped
from
him
and
left
him
again
the
eldest
son
of
the
house
and
of
his
two
parents
then
as
he
looked
into
the
pale
bearded
face
before
him
and
the
eyes
which
had
looked
into
his
own
a
few
months
ago
with
such
passionate
anger
he
remembered
all
that
was
between
them
dropped
the
hands
and
went
forward
to
the
fire
his
father
followed
him
and
stood
by
him
there
as
he
spread
his
fingers
to
the
blaze
and
told
him
the
details
in
short
detached
sentences
she
had
been
seized
with
pain
and
vomiting
on
the
previous
night
at
supper
time
the
doctor
had
been
sent
for
and
had
declared
the
illness
to
be
an
internal
inflammation
she
had
grown
steadily
worse
on
the
following
day
with
periods
of
unconsciousness
she
had
asked
for
ralph
an
hour
after
she
had
been
taken
ill
the
pain
had
seemed
to
become
fiercer
as
the
hours
went
on
she
had
died
at
ten
that
night
ralph
stood
there
and
listened
his
head
pressed
against
the
high
mantelpiece
and
his
fingers
stretching
and
closing
mechanically
to
supple
the
stiffened
joints
mistress
atherton
was
with
her
all
the
while
said
his
father
she
asked
for
her
ralph
shot
a
glance
sideways
and
down
again
and
he
began
yes
she
was
shriven
and
anointed
thank
god
she
could
not
receive
viaticum
ralph
did
not
know
whether
he
was
glad
or
sorry
at
that
news
it
was
a
proper
proceeding
at
any
rate
as
proper
as
the
candles
and
the
shroud
and
the
funeral
rites
as
regards
grief
he
did
not
feel
it
yet
but
he
was
aware
of
a
profound
sensation
in
his
soul
as
of
a
bruise
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
or
two
then
the
wind
bellowed
suddenly
in
the
chimney
the
tall
window
gave
a
crack
of
sound
and
the
smoke
eddied
out
into
the
room
ralph
turned
round
they
are
with
her
still
said
sir
james
we
can
go
up
presently
the
other
shook
his
head
abruptly
no
he
said
i
will
wait
until
which
is
my
room
your
old
room
said
his
father
i
have
had
a
set
there
for
your
man
will
you
find
your
way
i
must
stay
here
for
mistress
atherton
ralph
nodded
sharply
and
went
out
down
the
hill
it
was
half
an
hour
more
before
beatrice
appeared
and
then
sir
james
looked
up
from
his
chair
at
the
sound
of
a
footstep
and
saw
her
coming
up
the
matted
floor
her
face
was
steady
and
resolute
but
there
were
dark
patches
under
her
eyes
for
she
had
not
slept
for
two
nights
sir
james
stood
up
and
held
out
his
hands
ralph
has
come
he
said
he
is
gone
to
his
room
where
are
the
others
the
priests
are
at
prayers
and
meg
too
she
said
it
is
all
ready
sir
you
may
go
up
when
you
please
i
must
say
a
word
first
said
sir
james
sit
down
mistress
atherton
he
drew
forward
his
chair
for
her
and
himself
stood
up
on
the
hearth
leaning
his
head
on
his
hand
and
looking
down
into
the
fire
it
is
this
he
said
may
our
lord
reward
you
for
what
you
have
done
for
us
beatrice
was
silent
you
know
she
asked
my
pardon
he
said
when
we
were
left
alone
together
you
do
not
know
what
that
means
and
she
gave
me
her
forgiveness
for
all
my
folly
beatrice
drew
a
sharp
breath
in
spite
of
herself
we
have
both
sinned
he
went
on
we
did
not
understand
one
another
and
i
feared
we
should
part
so
that
we
have
not
we
have
to
thank
you
his
old
voice
broke
suddenly
and
beatrice
heard
him
draw
a
long
sobbing
breath
she
knew
she
ought
to
speak
but
her
brain
was
bewildered
with
the
want
of
sleep
and
the
long
struggle
she
could
not
think
of
a
word
to
say
she
felt
herself
on
the
verge
of
hysteria
you
have
done
it
all
he
said
again
presently
she
took
all
that
carleton
said
patiently
enough
he
told
me
it
is
all
your
work
mistress
atherton
she
looked
up
questioningly
with
her
bright
tired
eyes
mistress
atherton
may
i
know
what
you
said
to
her
beatrice
made
a
great
effort
and
recovered
her
i
answered
her
questions
she
said
questions
did
she
ask
you
of
the
faith
did
she
speak
of
me
am
i
asking
too
much
beatrice
shook
her
head
for
a
moment
again
she
could
not
speak
i
am
asking
what
i
should
not
said
the
old
man
no
no
cried
the
girl
you
have
a
right
to
know
wait
i
will
tell
you
again
she
broke
off
and
felt
her
own
breath
begin
to
sob
in
her
throat
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
a
moment
god
forgive
me
said
the
other
i
it
was
about
your
son
ralph
said
beatrice
bravely
though
her
lips
shook
she
she
asked
whether
i
had
ever
loved
him
at
all
and
mistress
beatrice
mistress
beatrice
i
entreat
you
not
to
say
more
and
i
told
her
yes
and
yes
still
chapter
v
the
mummers
it
was
a
strange
meeting
for
beatrice
and
ralph
the
next
morning
she
saw
him
first
from
the
gallery
in
chapel
at
mass
kneeling
by
his
father
motionless
and
upright
and
watched
him
go
down
the
aisle
when
it
was
over
she
waited
a
few
minutes
longer
quieting
herself
marshalling
her
forces
running
her
attention
over
each
movement
or
word
that
might
prove
unruly
in
his
presence
and
then
she
got
up
from
her
knees
and
went
down
it
had
been
an
intolerable
pain
to
tell
the
dying
woman
that
she
loved
her
son
it
tore
open
the
wound
again
for
she
had
never
yet
spoken
that
secret
aloud
to
any
living
soul
not
even
to
her
own
when
the
question
came
as
she
knew
it
would
she
had
not
hesitated
an
instant
as
to
the
answer
and
yet
the
answer
had
materialised
what
had
been
impalpable
before
as
she
had
looked
down
from
the
gallery
this
morning
she
knew
that
she
hated
in
theory
every
detail
of
his
outlook
on
life
he
was
brutal
insincere
he
had
lied
to
her
he
was
living
on
the
fruits
of
sacrilege
he
had
outraged
every
human
tie
he
possessed
and
yet
she
loved
every
hair
of
his
dark
head
every
movement
of
his
strong
hands
it
was
that
that
had
broken
down
the
mother
reserve
she
had
been
beaten
by
the
girl
insolence
as
a
dog
is
beaten
into
respect
she
had
only
one
thing
that
she
had
not
been
able
to
forgive
and
that
was
that
this
girl
had
tossed
aside
her
son
love
then
the
question
had
been
asked
and
answered
and
the
work
had
been
done
the
dying
woman
had
surrendered
wholly
to
the
superior
personality
and
had
obeyed
like
a
child
she
had
a
sense
of
terrible
guilt
as
she
went
downstairs
into
the
passage
that
opened
on
the
court
the
fact
that
she
had
put
into
words
what
had
lain
in
her
heart
made
her
fancy
that
the
secret
was
written
on
her
face
then
again
she
drove
the
imagination
down
by
sheer
will
she
knew
that
she
had
won
back
her
and
could
trust
her
own
discretion
their
greeting
was
that
of
two
acquaintances
there
was
not
the
tremor
of
an
eyelid
of
either
or
a
note
in
either
voice
that
betrayed
that
their
relations
had
once
been
different
ralph
thanked
her
courteously
for
her
attention
to
his
mother
and
she
made
a
proper
reply
then
they
all
sat
down
to
breakfast
then
margaret
had
to
be
attended
to
for
she
was
with
remorse
she
declared
to
beatrice
when
they
went
upstairs
together
that
she
had
been
a
wicked
daughter
that
she
had
resented
her
mother
words
again
and
again
had
behaved
insolently
and
so
forth
beatrice
took
her
in
her
arms
my
dear
she
said
indeed
you
must
leave
all
that
now
come
and
see
her
she
is
at
peace
and
you
must
be
the
bedroom
where
lady
torridon
had
died
was
arranged
as
a
ardente
the
great
bed
had
been
moved
out
into
the
centre
of
the
room
six
tall
candlesticks
with
escutcheons
and
yellow
tapers
formed
a
slender
mystical
wall
of
fire
and
light
about
it
the
windows
were
draped
a
couple
of
kneeling
desks
were
set
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
chris
was
kneeling
at
one
beside
his
father
as
they
went
in
and
mary
maxwell
who
had
arrived
a
few
hours
before
death
had
taken
place
was
by
herself
in
a
corner
beatrice
drew
margaret
to
the
second
desk
pushed
the
book
to
her
and
knelt
by
her
there
lay
the
body
of
the
strange
fierce
lonely
woman
with
her
beautiful
hands
crossed
pale
as
wax
with
a
crucifix
between
them
and
those
great
black
eyebrows
beyond
below
which
lay
the
double
reverse
curve
of
the
lashes
it
seemed
as
if
she
was
watching
them
both
as
her
manner
had
been
in
life
with
a
tranquil
cynicism
and
was
she
at
peace
thought
beatrice
as
she
had
told
her
daughter
just
now
was
it
possible
to
believe
that
that
stormy
vicious
spirit
had
been
quieted
so
suddenly
and
yet
that
would
be
no
greater
miracle
than
that
which
death
had
wrought
to
the
body
if
the
one
was
so
still
why
not
the
other
at
least
she
had
asked
pardon
of
her
husband
for
those
years
of
alienation
she
had
demanded
the
sacraments
of
the
church
beatrice
bowed
her
head
and
prayed
for
the
departed
soul
she
was
disturbed
by
the
soft
opening
of
a
door
and
lifted
her
eyes
to
see
ralph
stand
a
moment
by
the
head
of
the
bed
before
he
sank
on
his
knees
she
could
watch
every
detail
of
his
face
in
the
candlelight
his
thin
tight
lips
his
heavy
eyebrows
so
like
his
mother
his
curved
nostrils
the
clean
sharp
line
of
his
jaw
she
found
herself
analysing
his
processes
of
thought
his
mother
had
been
the
one
member
of
his
family
with
whom
he
had
had
sympathy
they
understood
one
another
these
two
bitter
souls
as
no
one
else
did
except
perhaps
beatrice
herself
how
aloof
they
had
stood
from
all
ordinary
affections
how
keen
must
have
been
their
dual
loneliness
and
what
did
this
snapped
thread
mean
to
him
now
to
what
in
his
opinion
did
the
broken
end
lead
that
had
passed
out
from
the
visible
world
to
the
invisible
did
he
think
that
all
was
over
and
that
the
one
soul
that
had
understood
his
own
had
passed
like
a
candle
flame
into
the
dark
and
she
too
was
she
crying
for
her
son
a
thin
soundless
sobbing
in
the
world
beyond
sight
above
all
did
he
understand
how
alone
he
was
now
how
utterly
eternally
alone
unless
he
turned
his
course
a
great
well
of
pity
broke
up
and
surged
in
her
heart
flooding
her
eyes
with
tears
as
she
looked
at
the
living
son
and
the
dead
mother
and
she
dropped
her
head
on
her
hands
again
and
prayed
for
his
soul
as
well
as
for
hers
it
was
a
very
strange
atmosphere
in
the
house
during
the
day
or
two
that
passed
before
the
funeral
the
household
met
at
meals
and
in
the
parlour
and
chapel
but
seldom
at
other
times
ralph
was
almost
invisible
and
silent
when
he
appeared
there
were
no
explanations
on
either
side
he
behaved
with
a
kind
of
distant
courtesy
to
the
others
answered
their
questions
volunteered
a
word
or
two
sometimes
made
himself
useful
in
small
ways
as
regarded
giving
orders
to
the
servants
inspecting
the
funeral
standard
and
scutcheons
and
making
one
or
two
arrangements
which
fell
to
him
naturally
and
went
out
by
himself
on
horseback
or
on
foot
during
the
afternoon
his
contempt
seemed
to
have
fallen
from
him
he
was
as
courteous
to
chris
as
to
the
others
but
no
word
was
spoken
on
either
side
as
regarded
either
the
past
and
the
great
gulf
that
separated
him
from
the
others
or
the
future
relations
between
him
and
his
home
the
funeral
took
place
three
days
after
death
on
the
saturday
morning
a
requiem
was
sung
in
the
presence
of
the
body
in
the
parish
church
and
beatrice
sat
with
the
mourners
in
the
torridon
chapel
behind
the
black
hearse
set
with
lights
before
the
open
vault
in
the
centre
of
the
pavement
ralph
sat
two
places
beyond
her
with
sir
james
between
and
she
was
again
vividly
conscious
of
his
presence
of
his
movements
as
he
knelt
and
sat
and
again
she
wondered
what
all
the
solemn
ceremonies
meant
to
him
the
yellow
candles
the
black
vestments
the
mysterious
hallowing
of
the
body
with
incense
and
water
counteracting
as
it
were
with
fragrance
and
brightness
the
corruption
and
darkness
of
the
grave
she
walked
back
with
margaret
who
clung
to
her
now
almost
desperately
finding
in
her
sane
serenity
an
antidote
to
her
own
remorse
and
as
she
walked
through
the
garden
and
across
the
moat
with
nicholas
and
mary
coming
behind
she
watched
the
three
men
going
in
front
sir
james
in
the
middle
the
monk
on
his
left
and
the
ralph
on
his
right
and
marvelled
at
the
grim
acting
there
they
went
the
father
and
his
two
sons
side
by
side
in
courteous
silence
she
noticed
ralph
step
forward
to
lift
the
latch
of
the
for
the
others
to
pass
through
and
between
them
lay
an
impassable
gulf
she
found
herself
wondering
whether
the
other
gulf
that
they
had
looked
into
half
an
hour
before
were
so
deep
or
wide
she
was
out
again
with
sir
james
alone
in
the
evening
before
supper
and
learnt
from
him
then
that
ralph
was
to
stay
till
monday
he
has
not
spoken
to
me
of
returning
again
said
the
old
man
of
course
it
is
impossible
do
you
not
think
so
mistress
atherton
it
is
impossible
she
said
what
good
would
be
served
what
good
repeated
the
other
the
evening
was
falling
swiftly
layer
on
layer
of
twilight
as
they
turned
to
come
back
to
the
house
the
steeple
of
the
church
rose
up
on
their
left
slender
and
ghostly
against
the
yellow
sky
out
of
the
black
yews
and
cypresses
that
lay
banked
below
it
they
stopped
and
looked
at
it
a
moment
as
it
aspired
to
heaven
from
the
bones
that
lay
about
its
base
like
an
eternal
resurrection
wrought
in
stone
there
all
about
it
were
the
mortal
and
the
dead
the
stones
and
iron
slabs
leaned
as
they
knew
in
hundreds
about
the
grass
and
round
them
again
stood
the
roofs
beginning
now
to
kindle
under
the
eaves
where
the
living
slept
and
ate
there
was
a
rumbling
of
heavy
carts
somewhere
beyond
the
village
a
crack
or
two
of
a
whip
the
barking
of
a
dog
then
they
turned
again
and
went
up
to
the
house
it
was
the
chaplain
who
was
late
this
evening
for
supper
the
others
waited
a
few
minutes
by
the
fire
but
there
was
no
sign
of
him
a
servant
was
sent
up
to
his
room
and
came
back
to
report
that
he
had
changed
his
cassock
and
gone
out
a
boy
had
come
from
the
said
the
man
ten
minutes
before
and
carleton
had
probably
been
sent
for
they
waited
yet
five
minutes
but
the
priest
did
not
appear
and
they
sat
down
supper
was
nearly
over
before
before
he
came
he
came
in
by
the
from
the
court
splashed
with
mud
and
looking
pale
and
concerned
he
went
straight
up
to
sir
james
may
i
speak
with
you
sir
he
said
the
old
man
got
up
at
once
and
went
down
the
hall
with
him
the
rest
waited
expecting
them
to
return
but
there
was
no
sign
of
them
and
ralph
at
last
rose
and
led
the
way
to
the
as
they
passed
the
door
of
sir
james
room
they
heard
the
sound
of
voices
within
conversation
was
a
very
difficult
matter
that
evening
ralph
had
behaved
with
considerable
grace
and
tact
but
nicholas
had
not
responded
ever
since
his
arrival
on
the
day
before
the
funeral
he
had
eyed
ralph
like
a
strange
dog
intruded
into
a
house
mary
had
hovered
round
her
husband
watchful
and
anxious
stepping
hastily
into
gaps
in
the
conversation
sliding
in
a
sentence
or
two
as
nicholas
licked
his
lips
in
preparation
for
a
snarl
once
even
putting
her
hand
swiftly
on
his
and
drowning
a
growl
with
a
word
of
her
own
ralph
had
been
wonderfully
only
once
had
beatrice
seen
him
show
his
teeth
for
a
moment
as
his
had
scowled
more
plainly
than
usual
the
atmosphere
was
charged
now
that
the
master
of
the
house
was
away
and
as
ralph
took
his
seat
in
his
father
chair
beatrice
had
caught
her
breath
for
a
moment
as
she
saw
the
look
on
nicholas
face
it
seemed
as
if
the
funeral
had
lifted
a
stone
that
had
hitherto
held
the
two
angry
spirits
down
nicholas
after
all
was
but
a
and
ralph
to
his
view
at
least
a
bad
son
she
feared
that
both
might
think
that
a
quarrel
did
not
outrage
decency
but
she
feared
for
nicholas
more
than
for
ralph
ralph
appeared
not
to
notice
the
other
scowl
and
leaned
easily
back
his
head
against
the
carved
heraldry
and
rapped
his
fingers
softly
and
rhythmically
on
the
bosses
of
the
arms
then
she
heard
nicholas
draw
a
slow
venomous
breath
and
the
talk
died
on
mary
lips
beatrice
stood
up
abruptly
in
desperation
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
but
the
movement
checked
nicholas
and
he
glanced
at
her
a
moment
then
mary
recovered
herself
put
her
hand
sharply
on
her
husband
and
slid
out
an
indifferent
sentence
beatrice
saw
eyes
move
swiftly
and
sideways
and
down
again
and
a
tiny
wrinkle
of
a
smile
show
itself
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
but
that
danger
was
passed
and
a
minute
later
they
heard
the
door
of
sir
james
room
opposite
open
and
the
footsteps
of
the
two
men
come
out
ralph
stood
up
at
once
as
his
father
came
in
followed
by
the
priest
and
stepped
back
to
the
there
was
the
faintest
hint
in
the
slight
motion
of
his
hands
to
the
effect
that
he
had
held
his
post
as
the
eldest
son
until
the
rightful
owner
came
but
the
consciousness
of
it
in
beatrice
mind
was
swept
away
as
she
looked
at
the
old
man
standing
with
a
white
stern
face
and
his
hands
clenched
at
his
sides
she
could
see
that
something
impended
and
stood
up
quickly
carleton
has
brought
shocking
news
he
said
abruptly
and
his
eyes
wandered
to
his
eldest
son
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
curtain
a
company
of
mummers
has
arrived
in
the
village
they
they
are
to
give
their
piece
there
was
a
dead
silence
for
a
moment
for
all
knew
what
this
meant
nicholas
sprang
to
his
feet
by
god
they
shall
not
he
said
sir
james
lifted
his
hand
sharply
we
can
not
hinder
it
he
said
the
priests
have
done
what
they
can
the
fellow
tells
them
he
paused
and
again
his
eyes
wandered
to
ralph
the
fellow
tells
them
he
is
under
the
protection
of
my
lord
cromwell
there
was
a
swift
rustle
in
the
room
nicholas
faced
sharply
round
to
the
his
hands
clenched
and
his
face
quivering
ralph
did
not
move
tell
them
father
said
sir
james
the
chaplain
gave
his
account
he
had
been
sent
for
by
the
parish
priest
just
before
supper
and
had
gone
with
him
to
the
barn
that
had
been
hired
for
the
performance
the
carts
had
arrived
that
evening
from
maidstone
and
were
being
unpacked
he
had
seen
the
properties
they
were
of
the
usual
kind
all
the
paraphernalia
for
the
parody
of
the
mass
that
was
usually
given
by
such
actors
he
had
seen
the
vestments
the
friar
habit
the
mask
the
woman
costume
and
wig
all
the
regular
articles
the
manager
had
tried
to
protest
against
the
entrance
had
denied
at
first
that
any
insult
was
intended
to
the
catholic
religion
and
had
finally
taken
refuge
in
defiance
he
had
flung
out
the
properties
before
their
eyes
had
declared
that
no
one
could
hinder
him
from
doing
as
he
pleased
since
the
archbishop
had
not
protested
and
lord
cromwell
had
given
him
his
express
sanction
we
did
all
we
were
able
said
the
priest
master
rector
said
he
would
put
all
the
parishioners
who
came
under
the
ban
of
the
church
the
fellow
snapped
his
fingers
in
his
face
i
told
them
of
sir
wishes
the
death
of
my
lady
it
was
of
no
avail
we
can
do
nothing
the
priest
sallow
face
was
flushed
with
fury
as
he
spoke
and
his
lips
trembled
piteously
with
horror
and
pain
it
was
the
first
time
that
the
mummers
had
been
near
overfield
they
had
heard
tales
of
them
from
other
parts
of
the
country
but
had
hoped
that
their
own
village
would
escape
the
corruption
and
now
it
had
come
he
stood
shaking
as
he
ended
his
account
carleton
says
it
would
be
of
no
avail
for
me
to
go
down
myself
i
wished
to
we
can
do
nothing
again
he
glanced
at
ralph
who
had
sat
down
silently
in
the
shadow
while
the
priest
talked
nicholas
could
be
restrained
no
longer
he
shook
off
his
wife
hand
and
took
a
step
across
the
room
and
you
you
sit
there
you
devil
he
shouted
sir
james
was
with
him
in
a
moment
so
swiftly
that
beatrice
did
not
see
him
move
margaret
was
clinging
to
her
now
whispering
and
sobbing
nick
snapped
out
the
old
man
hold
your
tongue
sir
sit
down
god
blood
bellowed
the
squire
you
bid
me
sit
down
sir
james
gripped
him
so
fiercely
that
he
stepped
back
i
bid
you
sit
down
he
said
ralph
will
you
help
us
ralph
stood
up
instantly
he
had
not
stirred
a
muscle
as
nick
shouted
at
him
i
waited
for
that
sir
he
said
what
is
it
you
would
have
me
do
beatrice
saw
that
his
face
was
quite
quiet
as
he
spoke
his
eyelids
drooped
a
little
and
his
mouth
was
tight
and
firm
he
seemed
not
to
be
aware
of
nicholas
presence
to
hinder
the
said
his
father
there
fell
a
dead
silence
again
i
will
do
it
sir
said
his
son
it
it
is
but
decent
and
in
the
moment
of
profound
astonishment
that
fell
he
came
straight
across
the
room
passed
by
them
all
without
turning
his
head
and
went
out
beatrice
felt
a
fierce
emotion
grip
her
throat
as
she
looked
after
him
and
saw
the
door
close
then
margaret
seized
her
again
and
she
turned
to
quiet
her
she
was
aware
that
sir
james
had
gone
out
after
his
son
after
a
moment
of
silence
and
she
heard
his
footsteps
pass
along
the
flags
outside
oh
god
bless
him
sobbed
margaret
sir
james
came
back
immediately
shook
his
head
went
across
the
room
and
sat
down
in
the
seat
that
ralph
had
left
a
dreadful
stillness
fell
margaret
was
quiet
now
mary
was
sitting
with
her
husband
on
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
chris
rose
presently
and
sat
down
by
his
father
but
no
one
spoke
a
word
then
nicholas
got
up
uneasily
came
across
the
room
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
hearth
warming
himself
beatrice
saw
him
glance
now
and
again
to
the
shadowed
where
the
two
men
sat
he
hummed
a
note
or
two
to
himself
softly
then
turned
round
and
stared
at
the
fire
with
outstretched
hands
the
bell
rang
for
prayers
and
still
without
a
word
being
spoken
they
all
got
up
and
went
out
in
the
same
silence
they
came
back
ralph
servant
was
standing
by
the
door
as
they
entered
if
you
please
sir
ralph
is
come
in
he
bade
me
tell
you
that
all
is
arranged
the
old
man
looked
at
him
swallowed
once
in
his
throat
and
at
last
spoke
it
is
arranged
you
say
it
will
not
take
place
it
will
not
take
place
sir
where
is
mr
ralph
he
is
gone
to
his
room
sir
he
bade
me
tell
you
he
would
be
leaving
early
for
london
chapter
vi
a
catastrophe
ralph
rode
away
early
next
morning
yet
not
so
early
as
to
escape
an
interview
with
his
father
they
met
in
the
hall
sir
james
in
his
loose
morning
gown
and
ralph
booted
and
spurred
with
his
short
cloak
and
tight
cap
the
old
man
took
him
by
the
sleeve
drawing
him
to
the
fire
that
burned
day
and
night
in
winter
ralph
ralph
my
son
he
said
i
must
thank
you
for
last
night
you
have
to
thank
yourself
only
sir
and
my
mother
i
could
do
no
otherwise
it
is
you
began
his
father
it
is
certainly
not
nick
sir
the
hot
fool
nearly
provoked
me
but
you
hate
such
mummery
yourself
my
son
ralph
hesitated
it
is
not
seemly
began
his
father
again
it
is
certainly
not
seemly
but
neither
are
the
common
folk
seemly
did
you
have
much
business
with
them
my
son
ralph
smiled
in
the
firelight
why
no
sir
i
told
them
who
i
was
i
charged
myself
with
the
burden
and
you
will
not
be
in
trouble
with
my
lord
my
lord
has
other
matters
to
think
of
than
a
parcel
of
mummers
then
they
separated
and
ralph
rode
down
the
drive
with
his
servants
behind
him
neither
father
nor
son
had
said
a
word
of
any
return
neither
had
ralph
had
one
private
word
with
beatrice
during
his
three
days
stay
once
he
had
come
into
the
parlour
to
find
her
going
out
at
the
other
door
and
he
had
wondered
whether
she
had
heard
his
step
and
gone
out
on
purpose
but
he
knew
very
well
that
under
the
superficial
courtesy
between
him
and
her
there
lay
something
deeper
some
passionate
emotion
vibrated
like
a
beam
between
them
but
he
did
not
know
even
on
his
side
and
still
less
on
hers
whether
that
emotion
were
one
of
love
or
loathing
it
was
partly
from
the
discomfort
of
the
charged
atmosphere
partly
from
a
shrinking
from
thanks
and
explanations
that
he
had
determined
to
go
up
to
london
a
day
earlier
than
he
had
intended
he
had
a
hatred
of
personal
elaborateness
he
found
cromwell
on
his
arrival
in
london
a
little
less
moody
than
he
had
been
in
the
previous
week
for
he
was
busy
with
preparations
for
the
parliament
that
was
to
meet
in
april
and
to
the
occupation
that
this
gave
him
there
was
added
a
good
deal
of
business
connected
with
negotiations
with
the
emperor
the
dispute
that
at
present
centred
round
the
treatment
of
englishmen
in
spain
and
other
similar
matters
in
reality
ran
its
roots
far
deeper
and
there
were
a
hundred
details
which
occupied
the
minister
but
there
was
still
a
hint
of
storm
in
the
air
cromwell
spoke
brusquely
once
or
twice
without
cause
and
ralph
refrained
from
saying
anything
about
the
affair
at
overfield
but
took
up
his
own
work
again
quietly
a
fortnight
later
however
he
heard
of
it
once
more
he
was
sitting
at
a
second
table
in
cromwell
own
room
in
the
rolls
house
when
one
of
the
secretaries
came
up
with
a
bundle
of
reports
and
laid
them
as
usual
before
ralph
ralph
finished
the
letter
he
was
engaged
on
one
to
barnes
who
had
preached
a
protestant
sermon
at
paul
cross
and
who
now
challenged
bishop
gardiner
to
a
public
disputation
ralph
was
telling
him
to
keep
his
pugnacity
to
himself
and
when
he
had
done
took
up
the
reports
and
ran
his
eyes
over
them
they
were
of
the
usual
nature
complaints
informations
protests
appeals
from
men
of
every
rank
of
life
agents
priests
fanatics
and
he
read
them
quickly
through
docketing
their
contents
at
the
head
of
each
that
his
master
might
be
saved
trouble
at
one
however
he
stopped
glanced
momentarily
at
cromwell
and
then
read
on
it
was
an
illiterate
letter
and
smudged
and
consisted
of
a
complaint
from
a
man
who
signed
himself
robert
benham
against
ralph
torridon
as
he
named
himself
for
hindering
the
performance
of
a
piece
entitled
the
jolly
friar
in
the
parish
of
overfield
on
sunday
february
the
first
torridon
the
writer
stated
had
used
my
lord
cromwell
name
and
authority
in
stopping
the
play
expenses
had
been
incurred
in
connection
with
it
for
a
barn
had
been
hired
and
the
transport
of
the
properties
had
cost
money
and
benham
desired
to
know
whether
these
expenses
would
be
made
good
to
him
and
if
torridon
had
acted
in
accordance
with
my
lord
wishes
ralph
bit
his
pen
in
some
perplexity
when
he
had
finished
making
out
the
document
he
wondered
whether
he
had
better
show
it
to
cromwell
it
might
irritate
him
or
not
according
to
his
mood
if
it
was
destroyed
surely
no
harm
would
be
done
and
yet
ralph
had
a
disinclination
to
destroy
it
he
sat
a
moment
or
two
longer
considering
once
he
took
the
paper
by
the
corners
to
tear
it
then
laid
it
down
again
glanced
once
more
at
the
heavy
intent
face
a
couple
of
yards
away
and
then
by
a
sudden
impulse
took
up
his
pen
and
wrote
a
line
on
the
corner
explaining
the
purport
of
the
paper
initialled
it
and
laid
it
with
the
rest
cromwell
was
so
busy
during
the
rest
of
the
day
that
there
was
no
opportunity
to
explain
the
circumstances
to
him
indeed
he
was
hardly
in
the
room
again
so
great
was
the
crowd
that
waited
on
him
continually
for
interviews
and
ralph
went
away
leaving
the
reports
for
his
chief
to
examine
at
his
leisure
the
next
morning
there
was
a
storm
cromwell
burst
out
on
him
as
soon
as
he
came
in
shut
the
door
torridon
he
snapped
i
must
have
a
word
with
you
ralph
closed
the
door
and
came
across
to
cromwell
table
and
stood
there
apparently
imperturbable
but
with
a
certain
quickening
of
his
pulse
what
is
this
sir
snarled
the
other
taking
up
the
letter
that
was
laid
at
his
hand
is
it
true
ralph
looked
at
him
coolly
what
is
it
my
lord
robert
benham
yes
robert
benham
is
it
true
i
wish
an
answer
certainly
my
lord
it
is
true
you
hindered
this
piece
being
played
and
you
used
my
name
i
told
them
who
i
was
yes
cromwell
slapped
the
paper
down
well
that
is
to
use
my
name
is
it
not
mr
torridon
i
suppose
it
is
you
suppose
it
is
and
tell
me
if
you
please
why
you
hindered
it
i
hindered
it
because
it
was
not
decent
my
mother
had
been
buried
that
day
my
father
asked
me
to
do
so
not
decent
when
the
mummers
have
my
authority
if
your
lordship
does
not
understand
the
indecency
i
can
not
explain
it
ralph
was
growing
angry
now
it
was
not
often
that
cromwell
treated
him
like
a
naughty
boy
and
he
was
beginning
to
resent
it
the
other
stared
at
him
under
black
brows
you
are
insolent
sir
ralph
bowed
see
here
said
cromwell
my
men
must
have
no
master
but
me
they
must
leave
houses
and
brethren
and
sisters
for
my
sake
you
should
understand
that
by
now
and
that
i
repay
them
a
hundredfold
you
have
been
long
enough
in
my
service
to
know
it
i
have
said
enough
you
can
sit
down
mr
torridon
ralph
went
to
his
seat
in
a
storm
of
fury
he
felt
he
was
supremely
in
the
right
in
the
right
in
stopping
the
play
and
still
more
so
for
not
destroying
the
complaint
when
it
was
in
his
hands
he
had
been
scolded
like
a
insulted
and
shouted
down
his
hand
shook
as
he
took
up
his
pen
and
he
kept
his
back
resolutely
turned
to
his
master
once
he
was
obliged
to
ask
him
a
question
and
he
did
so
with
an
icy
aloofness
cromwell
answered
him
curtly
but
not
unkindly
and
he
went
to
his
seat
again
still
angry
when
came
near
he
rose
bowed
slightly
to
cromwell
and
went
towards
the
door
as
his
fingers
touched
the
handle
he
heard
his
name
called
and
turned
round
to
see
the
other
looking
at
him
oddly
torridon
you
will
dine
with
me
i
regret
i
can
not
my
lord
said
ralph
and
went
out
of
the
room
there
were
no
explanations
or
apologies
on
either
side
when
they
met
again
but
in
a
few
days
their
behaviour
to
one
another
was
as
usual
yet
underneath
the
smooth
surface
ralph
heart
rankled
and
pricked
with
resentment
at
the
meeting
of
parliament
in
april
the
business
in
cromwell
hands
grew
more
and
more
heavy
and
distracting
ralph
went
with
him
to
westminster
and
heard
him
deliver
his
eloquent
little
speech
on
the
discord
that
prevailed
in
england
and
the
determination
to
restore
peace
and
concord
on
the
word
of
god
cried
the
statesman
speaking
with
extraordinary
fervour
his
eyes
kindling
as
he
looked
round
the
silent
crowded
benches
and
his
left
hand
playing
with
his
chain
on
the
word
of
god
his
highness
princely
mind
is
fixed
on
this
word
he
depends
for
his
sole
support
and
with
all
his
might
his
majesty
will
labour
that
error
shall
be
taken
away
and
true
doctrines
be
taught
to
his
people
modelled
by
the
rule
of
the
gospel
three
days
later
when
ralph
came
into
his
master
room
cromwell
looked
up
at
him
with
a
strange
animation
in
his
dark
eyes
sir
he
said
i
have
news
that
i
hope
will
please
you
his
grace
intends
to
confer
on
me
one
more
mark
of
his
favour
i
am
to
be
earl
of
essex
it
was
startling
news
ralph
had
supposed
that
the
minister
was
not
standing
so
high
with
the
king
as
formerly
since
the
unfortunate
incident
of
the
cleves
marriage
he
congratulated
him
warmly
it
is
a
happy
omen
said
the
other
let
us
pray
that
it
be
a
constellation
and
not
a
single
star
there
are
others
of
my
friends
torridon
who
have
claim
to
his
highness
gratitude
he
looked
at
him
smiling
and
ralph
felt
his
heart
quicken
once
more
as
it
always
did
at
the
hint
of
an
honour
for
himself
the
business
of
parliament
went
on
and
several
important
bills
became
law
a
was
followed
by
one
that
withdrew
from
most
of
the
towns
of
england
the
protection
of
a
sanctuary
in
the
case
of
certain
specified
crimes
the
navy
was
dealt
with
and
then
in
spite
of
the
promises
of
the
previous
years
a
heavy
was
passed
finally
five
more
catholics
four
priests
and
a
woman
were
attainted
for
high
treason
on
various
charges
ralph
was
not
altogether
happy
as
may
drew
on
there
began
to
be
signs
that
his
master
policy
with
regard
to
the
cleves
alliance
was
losing
ground
in
the
councils
of
the
state
but
cromwell
himself
seemed
to
acquiesce
so
it
appeared
as
if
his
own
mind
was
beginning
to
change
there
was
a
letter
to
pate
the
ambassador
to
the
emperor
that
ralph
had
to
copy
one
day
and
he
gathered
from
it
that
conciliation
was
to
be
used
towards
charles
in
place
of
the
old
defiance
but
he
did
not
see
much
of
parliament
affairs
this
month
cromwell
had
told
him
to
sort
a
large
quantity
of
private
papers
that
had
gradually
accumulated
in
ralph
own
house
at
westminster
for
that
he
desired
the
removal
of
most
of
them
to
his
own
keeping
they
were
an
enormous
mass
of
documents
dealing
with
every
sort
and
kind
of
the
huge
affairs
that
had
passed
through
cromwell
hands
for
the
last
five
years
they
concerned
hundreds
of
persons
living
and
dead
statesmen
nobles
the
foreign
courts
priests
religious
farmers
tradesmen
there
was
scarcely
a
class
that
was
not
represented
there
ralph
sat
hour
after
hour
in
his
chair
with
locked
doors
sorting
docketting
and
destroying
and
amazed
by
this
startling
of
the
vast
work
in
which
he
had
had
a
hand
there
were
secrets
there
that
would
burst
like
a
bomb
if
they
were
made
public
intrigues
bribes
threats
revelations
and
little
by
little
a
bundle
of
the
most
important
documents
accumulated
on
the
table
before
him
the
rest
lay
in
heaps
on
the
floor
those
that
he
had
set
aside
beneath
his
own
eye
were
a
miscellaneous
set
as
regarded
their
contents
the
only
unity
between
them
lay
in
the
fact
that
they
were
especially
perilous
to
cromwell
ralph
felt
as
if
he
were
handling
gunpowder
as
he
took
them
up
one
by
one
or
added
to
the
heap
the
new
coronet
that
my
lord
of
essex
had
lately
put
upon
his
head
would
not
be
there
another
day
if
these
were
made
public
there
would
not
be
left
even
a
head
to
put
it
upon
ralph
knew
that
a
great
minister
like
his
master
was
bound
to
have
a
finger
in
very
curious
affairs
but
he
had
not
recognised
how
exceptional
these
were
nor
how
many
until
he
had
the
bundle
of
papers
before
him
there
were
cases
in
which
persons
accused
and
even
convicted
of
high
treason
had
been
set
at
liberty
on
cromwell
sole
authority
without
reference
to
the
king
there
were
commissions
issued
in
his
name
under
similar
conditions
there
were
papers
containing
drafts
in
cromwell
own
hand
of
statements
of
doctrine
declared
heretical
by
the
six
articles
and
of
which
copies
had
been
distributed
through
the
country
at
his
express
order
there
were
copies
of
letters
to
ordering
the
release
of
convicted
heretics
and
the
imprisonment
of
their
accusers
there
were
evidences
of
enormous
bribes
received
by
him
for
the
perversion
of
justice
ralph
finished
his
task
one
june
evening
and
sat
dazed
with
work
and
excitement
his
fingers
soiled
with
ink
his
tired
eyes
staring
at
the
neat
bundle
before
him
the
privy
council
he
knew
was
sitting
that
afternoon
even
at
this
moment
probably
my
lord
of
essex
was
laying
down
the
law
speaking
in
the
king
name
silencing
his
opponents
by
sheer
force
of
will
but
with
the
royal
power
behind
him
and
here
lay
the
papers
he
imagined
to
himself
with
a
fanciful
recklessness
what
would
happen
if
he
made
his
way
into
the
and
laid
them
on
the
table
it
would
be
just
the
end
of
all
things
for
his
master
there
would
be
no
more
bullying
and
denouncing
then
on
that
side
it
would
be
a
matter
of
a
fight
for
life
the
memory
of
his
own
grudge
only
five
months
old
rose
before
his
mind
and
his
tired
brain
grew
hot
and
cloudy
with
resentment
he
took
up
the
bundle
in
his
hand
and
wielded
it
a
moment
as
a
man
might
test
a
sword
here
was
a
headsman
axe
ground
and
sharp
then
he
was
ashamed
set
the
bundle
down
again
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
stretched
his
arms
yawning
what
a
glorious
evening
it
was
he
must
go
out
and
take
the
air
for
a
little
by
the
river
he
would
walk
down
towards
chelsea
he
rose
up
from
his
chair
and
went
to
the
window
threw
it
open
and
leaned
out
his
house
stood
back
a
little
from
the
street
and
there
was
a
space
of
cobbled
ground
between
his
and
the
uneven
stones
of
the
thoroughfare
opposite
rose
up
one
of
the
tall
westminster
houses
pushing
forward
in
its
upper
stories
with
a
hundred
diamond
panes
bright
in
the
slanting
sunshine
that
poured
down
the
street
from
the
west
overhead
rose
up
the
fantastic
stately
chimneys
against
the
brilliant
evening
sky
and
to
right
and
left
the
street
passed
out
of
sight
in
a
haze
of
sunlight
it
was
a
very
quiet
evening
the
men
had
not
yet
begun
to
stream
homewards
from
their
occupations
and
the
women
were
busy
within
a
chorus
of
birds
sounded
somewhere
overhead
but
there
was
not
a
living
creature
to
be
seen
except
a
dog
asleep
in
the
sunshine
at
the
corner
of
the
gravel
it
was
delicious
to
lean
out
here
away
from
the
fire
that
burned
hot
and
red
in
the
grate
under
its
black
mass
of
papers
that
had
been
destroyed
out
in
the
light
and
air
ralph
determined
that
he
would
let
the
fire
die
now
it
would
not
be
needed
again
he
must
go
out
he
told
himself
and
not
linger
here
he
could
lock
up
the
papers
for
the
present
in
readiness
for
their
transport
next
day
and
he
wondered
vaguely
whether
his
hat
and
cane
were
in
the
below
he
straightened
himself
and
turned
away
from
the
window
noticing
as
he
did
so
the
dog
at
the
corner
of
the
street
sit
up
with
cocked
ears
he
hesitated
and
turned
back
there
was
a
sound
of
furious
running
coming
up
the
street
he
would
just
see
who
the
madman
was
who
ran
like
this
on
a
hot
evening
and
then
go
out
himself
as
he
leaned
again
the
pulsating
steps
came
nearer
they
were
coming
from
the
left
the
direction
of
the
palace
a
moment
later
a
figure
burst
into
sight
and
hatless
with
arms
gathered
to
the
sides
and
head
thrown
back
it
appeared
to
be
a
gentleman
by
the
dress
but
why
should
he
run
like
that
he
dashed
across
the
opening
and
disappeared
ralph
was
interested
he
waited
a
minute
longer
but
the
footsteps
had
ceased
and
he
was
just
turning
once
more
from
the
window
when
another
sound
made
him
stand
and
listen
again
it
came
from
the
same
direction
as
before
and
at
first
he
could
not
make
out
what
it
was
there
was
a
murmur
and
a
pattering
it
came
nearer
and
louder
and
he
could
distinguish
once
more
running
footsteps
were
they
after
a
thief
he
wondered
the
murmur
and
clatter
grew
louder
yet
and
a
second
or
two
later
two
men
burst
into
sight
one
an
apprentice
with
his
leather
apron
flapping
as
he
ran
the
other
a
stoutish
man
like
a
merchant
they
talked
and
gesticulated
as
they
went
the
murmur
behind
swelled
up
there
were
the
voices
of
many
people
men
and
women
talking
screaming
questioning
the
dog
was
on
his
feet
by
now
looking
intently
down
the
street
then
the
first
group
appeared
half
a
dozen
men
walking
fast
or
trotting
talking
eagerly
ralph
could
not
hear
what
they
said
then
a
number
surged
into
sight
all
at
once
jostling
round
a
centre
and
a
clamour
went
up
to
heaven
the
dog
trotted
up
suspiciously
as
if
to
enquire
ralph
grew
excited
he
scarcely
knew
why
he
had
seen
hundreds
of
such
crowds
it
might
mean
anything
from
a
rise
in
butter
to
a
declaration
of
war
but
there
was
something
fiercely
earnest
about
this
mob
was
the
king
ill
he
leaned
further
from
the
window
and
shouted
but
no
one
paid
him
the
slightest
attention
the
crowd
shifted
up
the
street
the
din
growing
as
they
went
there
was
a
sound
of
slammed
doors
windows
opened
opposite
and
heads
craned
out
something
was
shouted
up
and
the
heads
disappeared
ralph
sprang
back
from
the
window
as
more
and
more
surged
into
sight
he
went
to
his
door
glancing
at
his
papers
as
he
ran
across
unlocked
the
door
listened
a
moment
went
on
to
the
landing
and
shouted
for
a
servant
there
was
a
sound
of
footsteps
and
voices
below
the
men
were
already
alert
but
no
answer
came
to
his
call
he
shouted
again
who
is
there
find
out
what
the
disturbance
means
there
was
an
answer
from
one
of
his
men
and
the
street
door
opened
and
closed
again
he
ran
to
the
window
and
saw
his
man
run
out
without
his
doublet
across
the
court
and
seize
a
woman
by
the
arm
he
waited
in
passionate
expectancy
saw
him
drop
the
woman
arm
and
turn
to
another
and
then
run
swiftly
back
to
the
house
there
was
something
sinister
in
the
man
very
movements
across
that
little
space
he
ran
desperately
with
his
head
craning
forward
once
he
stumbled
once
he
glanced
up
at
his
master
and
ralph
caught
a
sight
of
his
face
ralph
was
on
the
landing
as
the
steps
thundered
upstairs
and
met
him
at
the
head
of
the
flight
speak
man
what
is
it
the
servant
lifted
a
face
stamped
with
terror
a
couple
of
feet
below
ralph
they
they
say
what
is
it
they
say
that
the
king
archers
are
about
my
lord
essex
house
ralph
drew
a
swift
breath
well
and
that
my
lord
was
arrested
at
the
council
ralph
turned
and
in
three
steps
was
in
his
room
again
the
key
clacked
in
the
lock
chapter
vii
a
question
of
loyalty
he
did
not
know
how
long
he
stood
there
with
the
bundle
of
papers
gripped
in
his
two
hands
and
the
thoughts
racing
through
his
brain
the
noises
in
the
street
outside
waned
and
waxed
again
as
the
news
swept
down
the
lanes
and
recoiled
with
a
wave
of
excited
crowds
following
it
then
again
they
died
to
a
steady
murmur
as
the
mob
surged
and
clamoured
round
the
palace
and
abbey
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
away
at
last
ralph
sat
down
still
holding
the
papers
he
must
clear
his
brain
and
how
was
that
possible
with
the
images
flashing
through
it
in
endless
and
vivid
succession
for
a
while
he
could
not
steady
himself
the
shock
was
bewildering
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
appalling
drama
essex
was
fallen
then
little
by
little
the
muddy
current
of
thought
began
to
run
clear
he
began
to
understand
what
lay
before
him
and
the
question
that
still
awaited
decision
his
first
instinct
had
been
to
dash
the
papers
on
to
the
fire
and
grind
them
into
the
red
heart
of
the
wood
but
something
had
checked
him
very
slowly
he
began
to
analyse
that
instinct
first
was
it
not
useless
he
knew
he
did
not
possess
one
hundredth
part
of
the
incriminating
evidence
that
was
in
existence
of
what
service
would
it
be
to
his
master
to
destroy
that
one
small
bundle
next
what
would
be
the
result
to
himself
if
he
did
it
was
known
that
he
was
a
trusted
agent
of
the
minister
his
house
would
be
searched
papers
would
be
found
it
would
be
certainly
known
that
he
had
made
away
with
evidence
there
would
be
records
of
what
he
had
in
the
other
houses
and
what
then
on
the
other
hand
if
he
willingly
gave
up
all
that
was
in
his
possession
it
would
go
far
to
free
him
from
complicity
lastly
like
a
venomous
snake
lifting
its
head
his
own
private
resentment
looked
him
in
the
eyes
and
there
was
a
new
sting
added
to
it
now
he
had
lost
all
he
knew
well
enough
wealth
honour
and
position
had
in
a
moment
shrunk
to
cinders
with
cromwell
fall
and
for
these
cinders
he
had
lost
beatrice
too
he
had
sacrificed
her
to
his
master
and
his
master
had
failed
him
a
kind
of
fury
succeeded
to
his
dismay
oh
would
it
not
be
sweet
to
add
even
one
more
stone
to
the
mass
that
was
tottering
over
the
head
of
that
mighty
bully
that
had
promised
and
not
performed
he
blinked
his
eyes
shocked
by
the
horror
of
the
thought
and
gripped
the
bundle
yet
more
firmly
the
memories
of
a
thousand
kindnesses
received
from
his
master
cried
at
the
door
of
his
heart
the
sweat
dropped
from
his
forehead
he
lifted
a
stiff
hand
to
wipe
it
away
and
dropped
it
again
into
its
grip
on
the
papers
then
he
slowly
recapitulated
to
himself
the
reasons
for
not
destroying
them
they
were
overwhelming
convincing
what
was
there
to
set
against
them
one
slender
instinct
only
that
cried
shrill
and
thin
that
in
honour
he
must
burn
that
damning
evidence
burn
it
burn
it
whether
or
no
it
would
help
or
hinder
it
must
be
burnt
then
again
he
recurred
to
the
other
side
told
himself
that
his
instinct
was
no
more
than
a
ludicrous
sentimentality
he
must
be
guided
by
reason
not
impulse
then
he
glanced
at
the
impulse
again
then
the
two
sides
rushed
together
locked
in
conflict
he
moaned
a
little
and
lay
back
in
his
chair
the
bright
sunlight
outside
had
faded
to
a
mellow
evening
atmosphere
before
he
moved
again
and
the
fire
had
died
to
one
dull
core
of
incandescence
as
he
stirred
he
became
aware
that
bells
were
pealing
outside
a
melodious
roar
filled
the
air
somewhere
behind
the
house
five
brazen
voices
shouting
all
together
bellowed
the
exultation
of
the
city
over
the
great
minister
fall
he
was
weary
and
stiff
as
he
stood
up
but
the
fever
had
left
his
brain
and
the
decision
had
been
made
he
relaxed
his
fingers
and
laid
the
bundle
softly
down
on
the
table
from
which
he
had
snatched
it
a
couple
of
hours
before
they
would
be
here
soon
he
knew
he
wondered
they
had
not
come
already
leaving
his
papers
there
he
went
out
taking
the
key
with
him
and
locking
the
door
after
him
he
called
up
one
of
his
men
telling
him
he
would
be
ready
for
supper
immediately
in
the
parlour
downstairs
and
that
any
visitors
who
came
for
him
were
to
be
admitted
at
once
then
he
passed
into
his
bedroom
to
wash
and
change
his
clothes
half
an
hour
later
he
came
upstairs
again
he
had
supped
alone
listening
and
watching
the
window
as
he
ate
but
no
sign
had
come
of
any
arrival
he
had
dressed
with
particular
care
intending
to
be
found
at
his
ease
when
the
searchers
did
arrive
there
must
be
no
sign
of
panic
or
anxiety
he
had
told
his
man
as
he
rose
from
table
to
say
to
any
that
came
for
him
that
they
were
expected
and
to
bring
them
immediately
upstairs
he
unlocked
the
door
of
his
private
room
and
went
in
all
was
as
he
had
left
it
the
floor
between
the
window
and
table
was
white
with
ordered
heaps
of
papers
the
bundle
on
the
table
itself
glimmered
where
he
had
laid
it
the
fire
had
sunk
to
a
spark
he
tenderly
lifted
off
the
masses
of
black
sheets
that
crackled
as
he
touched
them
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
before
that
these
evidences
of
even
a
harmless
destruction
had
better
be
removed
and
he
slid
them
carefully
on
to
a
broad
sheet
of
paper
folded
it
shaking
the
ashes
together
as
he
did
so
and
stood
a
moment
wondering
where
he
should
hide
it
the
room
was
growing
dark
now
he
put
the
package
down
went
to
the
fire
and
blew
it
up
a
little
added
some
wood
and
presently
the
flames
were
dancing
on
the
broad
hearth
as
he
stood
up
again
he
heard
the
knocker
rap
on
his
for
a
moment
he
had
an
instinct
to
run
to
the
window
and
see
who
was
there
but
he
put
it
aside
there
was
scarcely
time
to
hide
the
ashes
and
it
was
best
too
to
give
no
hint
of
anxiety
he
lifted
the
package
of
burnt
papers
once
more
and
stood
hesitating
a
press
would
be
worse
than
useless
as
a
all
such
would
of
course
be
searched
then
a
thought
struck
him
he
stood
up
noiselessly
on
his
chair
the
holbein
portrait
of
cromwell
in
his
furred
gown
and
chain
leaned
forward
from
the
tapestry
over
the
mantelpiece
ralph
set
one
hand
against
the
wall
at
the
side
and
then
tenderly
let
the
package
fall
behind
the
portrait
as
he
did
so
the
painted
and
living
eyes
were
on
a
level
it
seemed
strange
to
him
that
the
faces
were
so
near
together
at
that
moment
and
it
struck
him
with
a
grim
irony
that
the
master
should
be
so
protecting
the
servant
under
these
circumstances
then
he
dropped
lightly
to
the
ground
and
sat
quickly
in
the
chair
snatching
up
the
bundle
of
papers
from
the
table
as
he
did
so
the
steps
were
on
the
landing
now
he
heard
the
crack
of
the
balustrade
but
it
seemed
they
were
coming
very
quietly
there
was
a
moment
silence
the
muscles
of
his
throat
contracted
sharply
then
there
came
the
servant
tap
the
handle
was
turned
ralph
stood
up
quickly
still
holding
the
papers
as
the
door
opened
and
beatrice
stepped
forward
into
the
room
the
door
shut
noiselessly
behind
her
she
stood
there
with
the
firelight
playing
on
her
dark
mantle
the
hood
that
surrounded
her
head
her
pale
face
a
little
flushed
and
her
black
steady
eyes
her
breath
came
quickly
between
her
parted
lips
ralph
stared
at
her
dazed
by
the
shock
still
gripping
the
bundle
of
papers
she
moved
forward
a
step
and
the
spell
snapped
mistress
beatrice
he
said
i
have
come
she
said
what
is
it
you
want
me
she
came
round
the
table
with
an
air
of
eager
expectancy
i
i
did
not
know
said
ralph
but
you
wanted
me
what
is
the
matter
i
heard
you
call
ralph
stared
again
bewildered
call
he
said
yes
i
heard
you
i
was
in
my
room
at
my
aunt
house
ah
a
couple
of
hours
ago
you
called
me
twice
beatrice
then
then
they
told
me
what
had
happened
about
my
lord
essex
i
called
you
repeated
ralph
yes
you
called
me
your
voice
was
quite
close
to
me
at
my
ear
i
thought
you
were
in
the
room
tell
me
what
it
is
she
loosened
her
hold
of
her
mantle
as
she
stood
there
by
the
table
and
it
dropped
open
showing
a
sparkle
of
jewels
at
her
throat
she
threw
back
her
hood
and
it
dropped
on
to
her
shoulders
leaving
visible
the
coiled
masses
of
her
black
hair
set
with
knots
of
ribbon
i
did
not
call
said
ralph
dully
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
mistress
atherton
she
made
a
little
impatient
gesture
ah
yes
she
said
it
is
something
tell
me
quickly
i
suppose
it
has
to
do
with
my
lord
what
is
it
it
is
nothing
said
ralph
again
they
stood
looking
at
one
another
in
silence
beatrice
eyes
ran
a
moment
up
and
down
his
rich
dress
the
papers
in
his
hands
then
wandered
to
the
heaped
floor
the
table
and
returned
to
the
papers
in
his
hands
you
must
tell
me
she
said
what
is
that
you
are
holding
an
angry
terror
seized
ralph
that
is
my
affair
mistress
atherton
what
is
your
business
with
me
she
came
a
step
nearer
and
leant
her
left
hand
on
his
table
he
could
see
those
steady
eyes
on
his
face
she
looked
terribly
strong
and
controlled
indeed
you
must
tell
me
torridon
i
am
come
here
to
do
something
i
do
not
know
what
what
are
those
papers
he
turned
and
dropped
them
on
to
the
chair
behind
him
i
tell
you
again
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
it
is
useless
she
said
have
they
been
to
you
yet
what
do
you
mean
to
do
about
my
lord
you
know
he
is
in
the
tower
i
suppose
so
said
ralph
but
my
counsel
is
my
own
torridon
let
us
have
an
end
of
this
i
know
well
that
you
must
have
many
secrets
against
my
lord
i
tell
you
that
what
i
know
is
nothing
i
have
not
a
hundredth
part
of
his
papers
he
felt
himself
desperate
and
bewildered
like
a
man
being
pushed
to
the
edge
of
a
precipice
step
by
step
but
those
black
eyes
held
and
compelled
him
on
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
was
saying
and
are
these
papers
all
his
what
have
you
been
doing
with
them
my
lord
told
me
to
sort
them
the
words
were
drawn
out
against
his
own
will
and
those
in
your
hand
on
the
chair
what
are
they
ralph
made
one
more
violent
effort
to
regain
the
mastery
if
you
were
not
a
woman
mistress
atherton
i
should
tell
you
you
were
insolent
not
a
ripple
troubled
those
strong
eyes
tell
me
torridon
what
are
they
he
stood
silent
and
furious
i
will
tell
you
what
they
are
she
said
they
are
my
lord
secrets
is
it
not
so
and
you
were
about
to
burn
them
oh
ralph
is
it
not
so
her
voice
had
a
tone
of
entreaty
in
it
he
dropped
his
eyes
overcome
by
the
passion
that
streamed
from
her
is
it
not
so
she
cried
again
do
you
wish
me
to
do
so
he
said
amazed
his
voice
seemed
not
his
own
it
was
as
if
another
spoke
for
him
he
had
the
same
sensation
of
powerlessness
as
once
before
when
she
had
lashed
him
with
her
tongue
in
the
room
downstairs
wish
you
she
cried
why
yes
what
else
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
hers
the
room
seemed
to
have
grown
darker
yet
in
those
few
minutes
he
could
only
see
now
a
shadowed
face
looking
at
him
but
her
bright
passionate
eyes
shone
out
from
it
and
dominated
him
again
he
spoke
in
spite
of
himself
i
shall
not
burn
them
he
said
shall
not
shall
not
i
shall
not
he
said
again
there
was
silence
ralph
soul
was
struggling
desperately
within
him
he
put
out
his
hand
mechanically
and
took
up
the
papers
once
more
as
if
to
guard
them
from
this
fierce
imperious
woman
beatrice
eyes
followed
the
movement
and
then
rested
once
more
on
his
face
then
she
spoke
again
with
a
tense
deliberateness
that
drove
every
word
home
piercing
and
sharp
to
the
very
centre
of
his
spirit
listen
she
said
for
this
is
what
i
came
to
say
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
i
know
every
thought
as
if
it
were
my
own
you
tell
yourself
that
it
is
useless
to
burn
those
secrets
that
there
are
ten
thousand
more
enough
to
cast
my
lord
i
make
no
answer
to
that
you
tell
yourself
that
you
can
only
save
yourself
by
giving
them
up
to
his
enemies
i
make
no
answer
to
that
you
tell
yourself
that
it
will
be
known
if
you
destroy
them
that
you
will
be
counted
as
one
of
his
highness
enemies
i
make
no
answer
to
that
and
i
tell
you
to
burn
them
she
came
a
step
nearer
there
was
not
a
yard
between
them
now
and
the
fire
of
her
words
caught
and
scorched
him
with
their
bitterness
you
have
been
false
to
every
high
and
noble
thing
you
have
been
false
to
your
own
conscience
to
your
father
your
brother
your
sister
your
church
your
king
and
your
god
you
have
been
false
to
love
and
honour
you
have
been
false
to
yourself
and
now
almighty
god
of
his
courtesy
gives
you
one
more
opportunity
an
opportunity
to
be
true
to
your
master
i
say
nothing
of
him
god
is
his
judge
you
know
what
that
verdict
will
be
and
yet
i
bid
you
be
true
to
him
he
has
a
thousand
claims
on
you
you
have
served
him
though
it
be
but
satan
service
yet
it
is
the
highest
that
you
know
god
help
you
he
is
called
friendless
now
shall
that
be
wholly
true
of
him
you
will
be
called
a
traitor
presently
shall
that
be
wholly
true
of
you
or
shall
there
be
one
tiny
point
in
which
you
are
not
false
and
treacherous
as
you
have
been
in
all
other
points
she
stopped
again
looking
him
fiercely
in
the
eyes
from
the
street
outside
there
came
the
sound
of
footsteps
the
ring
of
steel
on
stone
ralph
heard
it
and
his
eyes
rolled
round
to
the
window
but
he
did
not
move
beatrice
was
almost
touching
him
now
he
felt
the
fragrance
that
hung
about
her
envelop
him
for
a
moment
then
he
felt
a
touch
on
the
papers
and
his
fingers
closed
more
tightly
the
steps
outside
grew
louder
and
ceased
and
the
house
suddenly
reverberated
with
a
thunder
of
knocking
beatrice
sprang
back
nay
you
shall
give
me
them
she
said
and
stood
waiting
with
outstretched
hand
ralph
lifted
the
papers
slowly
stared
at
them
and
at
her
then
he
held
them
out
in
a
moment
she
had
snatched
them
and
was
on
her
knees
by
the
hearth
ralph
watched
her
and
listened
to
the
steps
coming
up
the
stairs
the
papers
were
alight
now
the
girl
dashed
her
fingers
among
them
grinding
tearing
separating
the
heavy
pages
they
were
almost
gone
by
now
the
thick
smoke
poured
up
the
chimney
and
still
beatrice
tore
and
dashed
the
ashes
about
there
was
a
knocking
at
the
door
and
the
handle
turned
the
girl
rose
from
her
knees
and
smiled
at
ralph
as
the
door
opened
and
the
pursuivants
stood
there
in
the
opening
chapter
viii
to
charing
chris
had
something
very
like
remorse
after
ralph
had
left
overfield
and
no
words
of
explanation
or
regret
had
been
spoken
on
either
side
he
recognised
that
he
had
not
been
blameless
at
the
beginning
of
their
estrangement
if
indeed
there
ever
had
been
a
beginning
for
their
inflamed
relations
had
existed
to
some
extent
back
into
boyhood
as
far
as
he
could
remember
but
he
had
been
responsible
for
at
least
a
share
in
the
fierce
words
in
ralph
house
after
the
death
of
the
carthusians
he
had
been
insolent
theatrical
and
he
had
not
written
to
acknowledge
it
he
had
missed
another
opportunity
at
lewes
at
least
one
when
pride
had
held
him
back
from
speaking
for
fear
that
he
should
be
thought
to
be
currying
favour
and
now
this
last
opportunity
the
best
of
all
when
ralph
had
been
accessible
and
courteous
affected
chris
imagined
by
the
death
of
his
mother
this
too
had
been
missed
and
he
had
allowed
his
brother
to
ride
away
without
a
word
of
regret
or
more
than
formal
affection
he
was
troubled
at
mass
an
hour
after
ralph
had
gone
the
distraction
came
between
him
and
the
sweet
solemnity
upon
which
he
was
engaged
his
soul
was
dry
and
moody
he
showed
it
in
his
voice
as
a
younger
brother
in
past
years
as
a
monk
and
a
priest
now
he
knew
that
the
duty
of
the
first
step
to
a
reconciliation
had
lain
with
him
and
that
he
had
not
taken
it
it
had
been
a
troubled
household
altogether
when
ralph
had
gone
there
was
first
the
shock
of
lady
torridon
death
and
the
hundred
regrets
that
it
had
left
behind
then
beatrice
too
who
had
helped
them
all
so
much
had
told
them
that
she
must
go
back
to
town
her
aunt
was
alone
in
the
little
house
at
charing
for
the
friend
who
had
spent
christmas
there
was
gone
back
to
the
country
and
margaret
consequently
had
been
almost
in
despair
lastly
sir
james
himself
had
been
troubled
wondering
whether
he
might
not
have
been
warmer
with
ralph
more
outspoken
in
his
gratitude
for
the
affair
of
the
mummers
more
ready
to
welcome
an
explanation
from
his
son
the
shadow
of
ralph
then
rested
on
the
household
and
there
was
something
of
pathos
in
it
he
was
so
much
detached
now
so
lonely
and
it
seemed
that
he
was
content
it
should
be
so
there
were
pressing
matters
too
to
be
arranged
and
weightiest
of
all
those
relating
to
margaret
future
she
would
now
be
the
only
woman
besides
the
servants
in
the
house
and
it
was
growing
less
and
less
likely
that
she
would
be
ever
able
to
take
up
the
religious
life
again
in
england
there
seemed
little
reason
for
her
remaining
in
the
country
unless
indeed
she
threw
aside
the
religious
habit
altogether
and
went
to
live
at
great
keynes
as
mary
preferred
beatrice
made
an
offer
to
receive
her
in
london
for
a
while
but
in
this
case
again
she
would
have
to
wear
secular
dress
the
evening
before
beatrice
left
the
two
sat
and
talked
for
a
couple
of
hours
margaret
was
miserable
she
cried
a
little
clung
to
beatrice
and
then
was
ashamed
of
herself
my
dear
child
said
the
other
it
is
in
your
hands
you
can
do
as
you
please
but
i
can
not
sobbed
the
nun
i
can
not
i
do
not
know
let
me
come
with
you
beatrice
beatrice
then
settled
down
and
talked
to
her
she
told
her
of
her
duty
to
her
father
for
the
present
she
must
remember
that
he
was
lonely
now
in
any
case
she
must
not
think
of
leaving
home
for
another
six
months
in
the
meantime
she
had
to
consider
two
points
first
did
she
consider
herself
in
conscience
bound
to
religion
what
did
the
priest
tell
her
if
she
did
so
consider
herself
then
there
was
no
question
she
must
go
to
bruges
and
join
the
others
secondly
if
not
did
she
think
herself
justified
in
leaving
her
father
in
the
summer
if
so
she
might
either
go
to
great
keynes
or
come
up
for
at
least
a
long
visit
to
charing
and
what
do
you
think
asked
the
girl
piteously
do
you
wish
me
to
tell
you
said
beatrice
margaret
nodded
then
i
think
you
should
go
to
bruges
in
july
or
august
margaret
stared
at
her
the
tears
were
very
near
her
eyes
again
my
darling
i
should
love
to
have
you
in
london
went
on
the
other
caressing
her
of
course
i
should
but
i
can
not
see
that
king
henry
his
notions
make
any
difference
to
your
vows
they
surely
stand
is
it
not
so
my
dear
and
so
after
a
little
more
talk
margaret
consented
her
mind
had
told
her
that
all
along
it
was
her
heart
only
that
protested
against
this
final
separation
from
her
friend
chris
too
agreed
when
she
spoke
to
him
a
day
or
two
later
when
beatrice
had
gone
back
he
said
he
had
been
considering
his
own
case
too
and
that
unless
something
very
marked
intervened
he
proposed
to
follow
dom
anthony
abroad
they
could
travel
together
he
said
finally
when
the
matter
was
laid
before
their
father
he
also
consented
i
shall
do
very
well
he
said
mary
spoke
to
me
of
it
and
nicholas
has
asked
me
to
make
my
home
at
great
keynes
so
if
you
go
my
son
with
meg
in
the
summer
i
shall
finish
matters
here
lease
out
the
estate
and
carleton
and
i
shall
betake
ourselves
there
unless
he
said
unless
ralph
should
come
to
another
mind
as
the
spring
and
early
summer
drew
on
the
news
as
has
been
seen
was
not
reassuring
in
spite
of
the
six
articles
of
the
previous
year
by
which
all
vows
of
chastity
were
declared
binding
before
god
there
was
no
hint
of
making
it
possible
for
the
thousands
of
religious
in
england
still
compelled
by
them
to
return
to
the
life
in
which
such
vows
were
tolerable
the
religious
were
indeed
dispensed
from
obedience
and
poverty
by
the
civil
authority
it
was
possible
for
them
to
buy
inherit
and
occupy
property
but
a
recognition
of
their
corporate
life
was
as
far
as
ever
away
it
was
becoming
plainer
every
day
that
those
who
wished
to
pursue
their
vocation
must
do
so
in
voluntary
exile
and
letters
were
already
being
exchanged
between
the
brother
and
sister
at
home
and
the
representatives
of
their
respective
communities
on
the
continent
then
suddenly
on
the
eleventh
of
june
there
arrived
the
news
of
cromwell
fall
and
of
all
that
it
involved
to
ralph
they
were
at
dinner
when
it
came
there
was
a
door
suddenly
thrust
open
at
the
lower
end
of
the
hall
and
a
courier
white
with
dust
and
stiff
with
riding
limped
up
the
matting
and
delivered
beatrice
letter
it
was
very
short
come
she
had
written
my
lord
of
essex
is
arrested
he
is
in
the
tower
ralph
too
is
there
for
refusing
to
inform
against
him
he
has
behaved
gallantly
there
followed
a
line
from
mistress
jane
atherton
her
aunt
offering
rooms
in
her
own
house
a
wild
confusion
fell
upon
the
household
men
ran
to
and
fro
women
whispered
and
sobbed
in
corners
under
shadow
of
the
king
displeasure
that
lay
on
the
house
the
road
between
the
terrace
and
the
stable
buzzed
with
messengers
ordering
and
for
it
was
not
certain
at
first
that
margaret
would
not
go
a
mounted
groom
dashed
up
for
instructions
and
was
met
by
sir
james
in
his
on
the
terrace
who
bade
him
ride
to
great
keynes
with
the
news
and
entreat
sir
nicholas
maxwell
to
come
up
to
london
and
his
wife
to
overfield
there
was
not
time
to
write
sir
james
own
room
was
in
confusion
his
clothes
lay
tumbled
on
the
ground
and
a
distraught
servant
tossed
them
this
way
and
that
chris
was
changing
his
habit
upstairs
for
it
would
mean
disaster
to
go
to
town
as
a
monk
margaret
was
on
her
knees
in
chapel
silent
and
but
staring
piteously
at
the
compassionate
figure
of
the
great
mother
who
looked
down
on
her
with
her
son
in
her
arms
the
huge
dog
under
the
lifted
his
head
and
bayed
in
answer
as
frantic
figures
fled
across
the
court
before
him
and
over
all
lay
the
hot
june
sky
and
round
about
the
deep
peaceful
woods
a
start
was
made
at
three
sir
james
was
already
in
his
saddle
as
chris
ran
out
an
unfamiliar
figure
in
his
plain
priest
cloak
and
cap
and
great
riding
boots
beneath
a
couple
of
grooms
waited
behind
and
another
held
the
horse
margaret
was
on
the
steps
white
and
steadied
by
prayer
and
the
chaplain
stood
behind
with
a
strong
look
in
his
eyes
as
they
met
those
of
his
patron
take
care
of
her
father
take
care
of
her
her
sister
will
be
here
please
god
oh
god
bless
you
my
dear
pray
for
us
all
jesu
keep
us
all
chris
are
you
mounted
then
they
were
off
and
the
white
dust
rose
in
clouds
about
them
it
was
between
eight
and
nine
as
they
rode
up
the
north
bank
of
the
river
from
london
bridge
to
charing
it
had
been
a
terrible
ride
with
but
few
words
between
the
two
and
long
silences
that
were
the
worst
of
all
as
blotting
out
the
rich
country
and
the
deep
woods
and
the
meadows
and
heathery
hills
on
either
side
of
the
road
through
surrey
visions
moved
and
burned
before
them
such
as
the
king
vengeance
had
made
possible
to
the
imagination
from
far
away
across
the
southwark
fields
chris
had
seen
the
huddled
buildings
of
the
city
the
princely
spire
that
marked
them
and
had
heard
the
sweet
jangling
of
the
thousand
bells
that
told
the
angelus
but
he
had
thought
of
little
but
of
that
high
gateway
under
which
they
must
soon
pass
where
the
pikes
against
the
sky
made
palpable
the
horrors
of
his
thought
he
had
given
one
swift
glance
up
as
he
went
beneath
and
then
his
heart
sickened
as
they
went
on
past
the
houses
and
thomas
chapel
with
gleams
of
the
river
seen
beneath
then
as
he
looked
his
breath
came
sharp
far
down
there
eastwards
seen
for
a
moment
rose
up
the
sombre
towers
where
ralph
lay
and
the
saints
had
suffered
the
old
religious
houses
stretching
in
a
splendid
line
upwards
from
the
augustinian
priory
near
the
along
the
stream
that
flowed
down
from
ludgate
caught
the
last
rays
of
sunlight
high
against
the
rich
sky
as
the
riders
went
along
towards
charing
between
the
tide
and
the
slope
of
grass
on
their
right
and
the
sorrowful
heart
was
overlaid
again
with
sorrow
as
he
looked
at
them
empty
now
and
desolate
where
once
the
praises
of
god
had
sounded
day
and
night
they
stopped
beneath
the
swinging
sign
of
an
inn
with
westminister
towers
blue
and
magical
before
them
to
ask
for
mistress
house
and
were
directed
a
little
further
along
and
nearer
to
the
water
edge
it
was
a
little
old
house
when
they
came
to
it
built
on
a
tiny
private
embankment
that
jutted
out
over
the
flats
of
the
of
plaster
and
timber
with
overhanging
storeys
and
windows
beneath
the
roof
it
stood
by
itself
east
of
the
village
and
almost
before
the
jangle
of
the
bell
had
died
away
beatrice
herself
was
at
the
door
in
her
with
a
face
at
once
radiant
and
constrained
she
took
them
upstairs
immediately
after
directing
the
men
to
take
the
horses
when
they
had
unloaded
the
luggage
back
to
the
inn
where
they
had
enquired
the
way
for
there
was
no
stable
she
said
attached
to
the
house
chris
came
behind
his
father
as
if
in
a
dream
through
the
dark
little
hall
and
up
the
two
flights
on
to
the
first
landing
beatrice
stopped
at
a
door
you
can
say
what
you
will
she
said
before
my
aunt
she
is
of
our
mind
in
these
matters
then
they
were
in
the
room
a
couple
of
candles
burned
on
a
table
before
the
curtained
window
and
an
old
lady
with
a
wrinkled
kindly
face
hobbled
over
from
her
chair
and
greeted
the
two
travellers
i
welcome
you
gentlemen
she
said
if
a
sore
heart
may
say
so
to
sore
hearts
there
was
no
news
of
nicholas
they
were
told
he
had
not
been
heard
of
they
heard
the
story
so
far
as
beatrice
knew
it
but
it
was
softened
for
their
ears
she
had
found
ralph
she
said
hesitating
what
to
do
he
had
been
plainly
bewildered
by
the
sudden
news
they
had
talked
a
while
and
then
he
had
handed
her
the
papers
to
burn
the
magistrate
sent
by
the
council
had
arrived
to
find
the
ashes
still
smoking
he
had
questioned
ralph
sharply
for
he
had
come
with
authority
behind
him
and
ralph
had
refused
to
speak
beyond
telling
him
that
the
bundles
lying
on
the
floor
were
all
the
papers
of
my
lord
essex
that
were
in
his
possession
they
had
laid
hands
on
these
and
then
searched
the
room
a
quantity
of
ashes
beatrice
said
had
fallen
from
behind
a
portrait
over
the
hearth
when
they
had
shifted
it
then
the
magistrate
had
questioned
her
too
enquired
where
she
lived
and
let
her
go
she
had
waited
at
the
corner
of
the
street
and
watched
the
men
come
out
ralph
walked
in
the
centre
as
a
prisoner
she
had
followed
them
to
the
river
had
mixed
with
the
crowd
that
gathered
there
and
had
heard
the
order
given
to
the
wherryman
to
pull
to
the
tower
that
was
all
that
she
knew
thank
god
for
your
son
sir
he
bore
himself
gallantly
there
was
a
silence
as
she
ended
the
old
man
looked
at
her
wondering
and
dazed
it
was
so
sad
that
the
news
scarcely
yet
conveyed
its
message
and
my
lord
essex
he
said
my
lord
is
in
the
tower
too
he
was
arrested
at
the
council
by
the
duke
of
norfolk
the
old
lady
intervened
then
and
insisted
on
their
going
down
to
supper
it
would
be
ready
by
now
she
said
in
the
parlour
downstairs
they
supped
themselves
silent
with
beatrice
leaning
her
arms
on
the
table
and
talking
to
them
in
a
low
voice
telling
them
all
that
was
said
she
did
not
attempt
to
prophesy
smoothly
the
feeling
against
cromwell
she
said
passed
all
belief
the
streets
had
been
filled
with
a
roaring
crowd
last
night
she
had
heard
them
bellowing
till
long
after
dark
the
bells
were
pealed
in
the
city
churches
hour
after
hour
in
triumph
over
the
minister
fall
the
dogs
she
said
fiercely
i
never
thought
to
say
it
but
my
heart
goes
out
to
him
her
spirit
was
infections
chris
felt
a
kind
of
recklessness
tingle
in
his
veins
as
he
listened
to
her
talk
and
watched
her
black
eyes
hot
with
indignation
and
firm
with
purpose
what
if
ralph
were
cast
at
least
it
was
for
faithfulness
of
a
kind
even
the
face
grew
steadier
that
piteous
trembling
of
the
lower
lip
ceased
and
the
horror
left
his
eyes
it
was
hard
to
remain
in
panic
with
that
girl
beside
them
they
had
scarcely
done
supper
when
the
bell
of
the
outer
door
rang
again
and
a
moment
later
nicholas
was
with
them
flushed
with
hard
riding
he
strode
into
the
room
blinking
at
the
lights
and
tossed
his
riding
whip
on
to
the
table
i
have
been
to
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
he
said
i
know
him
of
old
he
promises
nothing
he
tells
me
that
ralph
is
mary
is
gone
to
overfield
god
damn
the
king
he
had
no
more
news
to
give
he
had
sent
off
his
wife
at
once
on
receiving
the
tidings
and
had
started
half
an
hour
later
for
london
he
had
been
ahead
of
them
all
the
way
it
seemed
but
had
spent
a
couple
of
hours
first
in
trying
to
get
admittance
to
the
tower
and
then
in
interviewing
the
lieutenant
but
there
was
no
satisfaction
to
be
gained
there
the
utmost
he
had
wrung
from
him
was
a
promise
that
he
would
see
him
again
and
hear
what
he
had
to
say
then
nicholas
had
to
sup
and
hear
the
whole
story
from
the
beginning
and
chris
left
his
father
to
tell
it
and
went
up
with
beatrice
to
arrange
about
rooms
matters
were
soon
settled
with
the
old
lady
nicholas
and
chris
were
to
sleep
in
one
room
and
sir
james
in
an
another
two
servants
only
could
be
accommodated
in
the
house
the
rest
were
to
put
up
at
the
inn
beatrice
went
off
to
give
the
necessary
orders
mistress
jane
atherton
and
chris
had
a
few
moments
together
before
the
others
came
up
a
sore
heart
said
the
old
lady
again
but
a
glad
one
too
beatrice
has
told
me
everything
i
am
thankful
too
said
chris
softly
i
wonder
if
my
father
understands
he
will
father
he
will
but
even
if
he
does
not
well
god
knows
all
it
was
evident
when
sir
james
came
upstairs
presently
that
he
did
not
understand
anything
yet
except
that
beatrice
thought
that
ralph
had
behaved
well
but
it
is
to
my
lord
essex
who
has
been
the
worker
of
all
the
mischief
that
my
son
is
faithful
is
that
a
good
thing
then
why
yes
said
chris
you
would
not
have
him
faithless
there
too
but
would
he
not
be
on
god
side
at
last
if
he
were
against
cromwell
the
old
man
was
still
too
much
bewildered
to
understand
explanations
and
his
son
was
silent
chris
could
not
sleep
that
night
and
long
after
nicholas
lay
deep
in
his
pillow
with
open
mouth
and
tight
eyes
the
priest
was
at
the
window
looking
out
over
the
river
where
the
moon
hung
like
a
silver
shield
above
southwark
the
meadows
beyond
the
stream
were
dim
and
colourless
here
and
there
a
roof
rose
among
trees
and
straight
across
the
broad
water
to
his
feet
ran
a
path
of
heaving
glory
where
the
strong
ripple
tossed
the
silver
surface
that
streamed
down
upon
it
from
the
moon
london
lay
round
him
as
quiet
as
overfield
and
chris
remembered
with
a
stir
at
his
heart
his
moonlight
bathe
all
those
years
ago
in
the
lake
at
home
when
he
had
come
back
hot
from
hunting
and
had
slipped
down
with
the
chaplain
after
supper
then
the
water
had
seemed
like
a
cool
restful
gulf
in
the
world
of
sensation
the
moon
had
not
been
risen
at
first
only
the
stars
pricked
above
and
below
in
air
and
water
then
the
moon
had
come
up
and
a
path
of
splendour
had
smitten
the
surface
into
sight
he
had
swum
up
it
he
remembered
the
silver
ripple
washing
over
his
shoulders
as
he
went
and
now
those
years
of
monastic
peace
and
storm
had
come
and
gone
sifting
and
penetrating
his
soul
washing
out
from
it
little
by
little
the
heats
and
passions
with
which
he
had
plunged
as
he
looked
back
on
himself
he
was
astonished
at
his
old
complacent
smallness
his
figure
appeared
down
that
avenue
of
years
a
tiny
passionate
thing
gesticulating
feverish
he
remembered
his
serene
certainty
that
he
was
right
and
ralph
wrong
in
every
touch
of
friction
between
them
his
own
furious
and
theatrical
outburst
at
the
death
of
the
carthusians
his
absurd
dignity
on
later
occasions
even
in
those
first
beginnings
of
peace
when
the
inner
life
had
begun
to
well
up
and
envelop
him
he
had
been
narrow
and
he
had
despised
the
common
human
life
not
understanding
that
god
will
was
as
energetic
in
the
bewildering
rush
of
the
current
as
in
the
quiet
sheltered
to
which
he
himself
had
been
called
he
had
been
awakened
from
that
dream
by
the
fall
of
the
priory
and
that
to
which
he
opened
his
eyes
had
been
forced
into
his
consciousness
by
the
months
at
home
when
he
had
had
that
astringent
mingling
of
the
world
and
the
spirit
of
the
interpenetration
of
the
inner
by
the
outer
and
now
for
the
first
time
he
stood
as
a
balanced
soul
between
the
two
alight
with
a
tranquil
grace
within
and
not
afraid
to
look
at
the
darkness
without
he
was
ready
now
for
either
life
to
go
back
to
the
cloister
and
labour
there
for
the
world
at
the
springs
of
energy
or
to
take
his
place
in
the
new
england
and
struggle
at
the
tossing
surface
he
stood
here
now
by
the
hurrying
turbulent
stream
a
wider
and
more
perilous
gulf
than
that
that
had
lain
before
him
as
he
looked
at
the
moonlit
lake
at
overfield
and
yet
over
it
brooded
the
same
quiet
shield
of
heaven
gilding
the
black
swift
flowing
forces
with
the
promise
of
a
presence
greater
than
them
all
he
stood
there
long
staring
and
thinking
chapter
ix
a
the
days
that
followed
were
very
anxious
and
troubled
ones
for
friends
at
charing
they
were
dreadful
too
from
their
very
uneventfulness
on
the
morning
following
their
arrival
chris
went
off
to
the
temple
to
consult
a
lawyer
that
the
lieutenant
had
recommended
to
nicholas
and
brought
him
back
with
him
an
hour
later
the
first
need
to
be
supplied
was
their
lack
of
knowledge
as
to
procedure
and
the
four
men
sat
together
until
dinner
in
the
parlour
on
the
first
floor
looking
over
the
sunlit
river
and
discussed
the
entire
situation
the
lawyer
herries
a
northerner
sat
with
his
back
to
the
window
fingering
a
quill
horizontally
in
his
lean
brown
fingers
and
talking
in
short
sentences
glancing
up
between
them
with
patient
silences
as
the
others
talked
he
seemed
the
very
incarnation
of
the
slow
inaction
that
was
so
infinitely
trying
to
these
anxious
souls
the
three
laymen
did
not
even
know
the
crime
with
which
ralph
was
charged
but
they
soon
learnt
that
the
technical
phrase
for
it
was
misprision
of
treason
torridon
was
arrested
i
understand
said
the
lawyer
by
order
of
council
he
would
have
been
arrested
in
any
case
he
was
known
to
be
privy
to
my
lord
essex
schemes
you
inform
me
that
he
destroyed
evidence
that
will
go
against
him
if
they
can
prove
it
he
drew
the
quill
softly
through
his
lips
and
then
fell
to
fingering
it
again
as
the
others
stared
at
him
however
went
on
herries
that
is
not
our
affair
now
there
will
be
time
for
that
our
question
is
when
will
he
be
charged
and
how
my
lord
essex
may
be
tried
by
a
court
or
attainted
in
parliament
i
should
suppose
the
latter
torridon
will
be
treated
in
the
same
way
if
it
be
the
former
we
can
do
nothing
but
wait
and
prepare
our
case
if
it
be
the
latter
we
must
do
our
utmost
to
keep
his
name
out
of
the
bill
he
went
on
to
explain
his
reasons
for
thinking
that
a
bill
of
attainder
would
be
brought
against
cromwell
it
was
the
customary
method
he
said
for
dealing
with
eminent
culprits
and
its
range
had
been
greatly
extended
by
cromwell
himself
at
this
moment
three
catholics
lay
in
the
tower
attainted
through
the
statesman
own
efforts
for
their
supposed
share
in
a
conspiracy
to
deliver
up
calais
to
the
invaders
who
had
threatened
england
in
the
previous
year
feeling
too
ran
very
high
against
cromwell
the
public
would
be
impatient
of
a
long
trial
and
a
bill
of
attainder
would
give
a
readier
outlet
to
the
fury
against
him
this
then
was
the
danger
but
they
could
do
nothing
said
the
lawyer
to
avert
it
until
they
could
get
information
he
would
charge
himself
with
that
business
and
communicate
with
them
as
soon
as
he
knew
and
then
asked
chris
looking
at
him
desperately
for
the
cold
deliberate
air
of
herries
gave
him
a
terrible
sense
of
the
passionless
process
of
the
law
i
was
about
to
speak
of
that
said
the
lawyer
if
it
goes
as
i
think
it
will
and
torridon
name
is
suggested
for
the
bill
we
must
approach
the
most
powerful
friends
we
can
lay
hold
on
to
use
their
influence
against
his
inclusion
have
you
any
such
sir
he
added
looking
at
sir
james
sharply
over
the
quill
the
old
man
shook
his
head
i
know
no
one
he
said
the
lawyer
pursed
his
lips
then
we
must
do
the
best
we
can
we
can
set
aside
at
once
all
of
my
lord
essex
enemies
and
and
he
has
many
now
two
names
come
to
my
mind
master
ralph
sadler
the
comptroller
and
my
lord
of
canterbury
ah
cried
chris
dropping
his
hand
my
lord
of
canterbury
my
brother
has
had
dealings
with
him
sir
james
straightened
himself
in
his
chair
i
will
ask
no
favour
of
that
fellow
he
said
sternly
the
lawyer
looked
at
him
with
a
cocked
eyebrow
well
sir
he
said
if
you
will
not
you
will
not
but
i
can
not
suggest
a
better
he
is
in
high
favour
with
his
grace
they
say
he
has
already
said
a
word
for
my
lord
essex
not
much
much
would
be
too
much
i
think
but
still
was
something
and
what
of
master
sadler
i
know
nothing
of
him
faltered
the
old
man
there
was
silence
a
moment
well
sir
said
herries
you
can
think
the
matter
over
i
am
for
my
lord
of
canterbury
for
the
reasons
i
have
named
to
you
but
we
can
wait
a
few
days
we
can
do
nothing
until
the
method
of
procedure
is
known
then
he
went
promising
to
let
them
know
as
soon
as
he
had
information
rumours
began
to
run
swiftly
through
the
city
it
was
said
though
untruly
at
that
time
that
cromwell
had
addressed
a
letter
to
the
king
at
henry
own
request
explaining
his
conduct
utterly
denying
that
he
had
said
certain
rash
words
attributed
to
him
and
that
his
majesty
was
greatly
affected
by
it
there
was
immense
excitement
everywhere
a
crowd
assembled
daily
outside
westminster
hall
groups
at
every
corner
of
the
streets
discussed
the
fallen
minister
chances
and
shouts
were
raised
for
those
who
were
known
to
be
his
enemies
the
duke
of
norfolk
rich
and
others
as
they
rode
through
to
the
palace
meanwhile
ralph
friends
could
do
little
nicholas
rode
down
once
or
twice
to
see
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
and
managed
to
extract
a
promise
that
ralph
should
hear
of
their
presence
in
london
but
he
could
not
get
to
see
him
or
hear
any
news
except
that
he
was
in
good
health
and
spirits
and
was
lodged
in
a
private
cell
then
suddenly
one
afternoon
a
small
piece
of
news
arrived
from
herries
to
the
effect
that
cromwell
was
to
be
attainted
and
anxiety
became
intense
as
to
whether
ralph
would
be
included
sir
james
could
eat
nothing
at
supper
but
sat
crumbling
his
bread
while
beatrice
talked
almost
feverishly
in
an
attempt
to
distract
him
finally
he
rose
and
went
out
and
the
others
sat
on
eyeing
one
another
anxious
and
miserable
in
desperation
nicholas
began
to
talk
of
his
visit
to
the
tower
of
the
lieutenant
timidity
and
his
own
insistence
and
they
noticed
nothing
till
the
door
was
flung
open
and
the
old
man
stood
there
his
eyes
bright
and
his
lips
trembling
with
hope
he
held
a
scrap
of
paper
in
his
hand
listen
he
cried
as
the
others
sprang
to
their
feet
a
fellow
has
just
come
from
herries
with
this
he
lifted
the
paper
and
read
torridon
name
is
not
in
the
bill
i
will
be
with
you
thank
god
said
chris
there
was
another
long
discussion
the
following
morning
herries
arrived
about
ten
to
certify
his
news
and
the
four
sat
till
dinner
once
again
talking
and
planning
there
was
not
the
same
desperate
hurry
now
the
first
danger
was
passed
there
was
only
one
thing
that
the
lawyer
could
do
and
that
was
to
repeat
his
advice
to
seek
the
intercession
of
the
archbishop
he
observed
again
that
while
cranmer
had
the
friendship
of
the
fallen
minister
he
had
not
in
any
sense
been
involved
in
his
fall
he
was
still
powerful
with
the
king
and
of
considerable
weight
with
the
council
in
consequence
he
was
likely
therefore
to
be
both
able
and
willing
to
speak
on
behalf
of
cromwell
agent
but
i
would
advise
nothing
to
be
done
until
the
bill
of
attainder
has
come
before
parliament
we
do
not
know
yet
how
far
torridon
action
has
affected
the
evidence
from
what
you
say
gentlemen
and
from
what
i
have
heard
elsewhere
i
should
think
that
the
papers
torridon
destroyed
are
not
essential
to
a
conviction
my
lord
papers
at
his
own
house
are
sufficient
but
they
had
some
difficulty
in
persuading
sir
james
to
consent
to
ask
a
favour
of
the
archbishop
in
his
eyes
cranmer
was
beyond
the
pale
of
decency
he
had
lived
with
two
women
said
the
old
man
whom
he
called
his
wives
although
as
a
priest
he
was
incapable
of
marriage
he
had
violated
his
consecration
oath
he
had
blessed
and
annulled
the
frequent
marriages
of
the
king
with
equal
readiness
he
was
a
heretic
confessed
and
open
on
numberless
points
of
the
catholic
faith
herries
pointed
out
with
laborious
minuteness
that
this
was
beside
the
question
altogether
he
did
not
propose
that
sir
james
torridon
should
go
to
the
archbishop
as
to
a
spiritual
superior
but
as
to
one
who
chanced
to
have
great
influence
if
he
were
a
murderer
it
would
make
no
difference
to
his
advice
chris
broke
in
with
troubled
eyes
indeed
sir
he
said
to
his
father
you
know
how
i
am
with
you
in
all
that
you
say
and
yet
i
am
with
herries
too
i
do
not
understand
god
help
us
cried
the
old
man
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
will
you
talk
with
mistress
beatrice
asked
chris
sir
james
nodded
i
will
do
that
he
said
the
next
day
the
bill
was
passed
and
the
party
in
the
house
at
charing
sat
sick
at
heart
within
doors
hearing
the
crowds
roaring
down
the
street
singing
and
shouting
in
triumph
every
cry
tore
their
hearts
for
was
it
not
against
ralph
master
and
friend
that
they
rejoiced
as
they
sat
at
supper
a
great
battering
broke
out
at
the
door
that
looked
on
to
the
lane
and
they
sprang
up
to
hear
a
drunken
voice
bellowing
at
them
to
come
out
and
shout
for
liberty
nicholas
went
crimson
with
anger
and
he
made
a
movement
towards
the
hall
his
hand
on
his
hilt
ah
sit
down
nick
said
the
monk
the
drunken
fool
is
away
again
and
they
heard
the
steps
reel
on
towards
westminster
it
was
not
until
a
fortnight
later
that
they
went
at
last
to
lambeth
sir
james
had
been
hard
to
persuade
but
beatrice
had
succeeded
at
last
nicholas
had
professed
himself
ready
to
ask
a
favour
of
the
devil
himself
under
the
circumstances
and
chris
himself
continued
to
support
the
lawyer
opinion
he
repeated
his
arguments
again
and
again
then
it
was
necessary
to
make
an
appointment
with
the
archbishop
and
a
day
was
fixed
at
last
my
lord
would
see
them
wrote
a
secretary
at
two
on
the
afternoon
of
july
the
third
beatrice
sat
through
that
long
hot
afternoon
in
the
of
the
upstairs
parlour
looking
out
over
the
wide
river
below
conscious
perhaps
for
the
first
time
of
the
vast
weight
of
responsibility
that
rested
on
her
she
had
seen
them
go
off
in
a
wherry
the
father
and
son
with
nicholas
in
the
stern
and
the
lawyer
facing
them
on
the
they
had
been
terribly
silent
as
they
walked
down
to
the
stairs
had
stood
waiting
there
without
a
word
being
spoken
but
by
herself
as
the
wherry
made
ready
and
she
had
talked
hopelessly
desperately
to
relieve
the
tension
then
they
had
gone
off
sir
james
had
looked
back
at
her
over
his
shoulder
as
the
boat
put
out
and
she
had
seen
his
lips
move
she
had
watched
them
grow
smaller
and
smaller
as
they
went
and
then
when
a
barge
had
come
between
her
and
them
she
had
gone
home
alone
to
wait
for
their
return
and
the
tidings
that
they
would
bring
and
she
in
a
sense
was
responsible
for
it
all
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
visit
to
ralph
he
would
have
handed
the
papers
over
to
the
authorities
he
would
be
at
liberty
now
no
doubt
as
were
other
agents
and
as
she
thought
of
it
her
tortured
heart
asked
again
and
again
whether
after
all
she
had
done
right
she
went
over
the
whole
question
as
she
sat
there
looking
out
over
the
river
towards
lambeth
fingering
the
shutter
glancing
now
and
again
at
the
bent
old
figure
of
her
aunt
in
her
tall
chair
and
listening
to
the
rip
of
the
needle
through
the
silk
could
she
have
done
otherwise
was
her
interference
and
advice
after
all
but
a
piece
of
mad
chivalry
unnecessary
and
unpractical
and
yet
she
knew
that
she
would
do
it
again
if
the
same
circumstances
arose
it
would
be
impossible
to
do
otherwise
reason
was
against
it
herries
had
hinted
as
much
with
a
quick
lifting
of
his
bushy
eyebrows
as
she
had
told
him
the
story
it
would
have
made
no
difference
to
cromwell
ah
but
she
had
not
done
it
for
that
it
was
for
the
sake
of
ralph
himself
that
he
might
not
lose
the
one
opportunity
that
came
to
him
of
making
a
movement
back
towards
the
honour
he
had
forfeited
but
it
was
no
less
torture
to
think
of
it
all
as
she
sat
here
she
had
faced
the
question
before
but
now
the
misery
she
had
watched
during
these
last
three
weeks
had
driven
it
home
day
by
day
she
had
seen
the
old
father
face
grow
lined
and
haggard
as
the
suspense
gnawed
at
his
heart
she
had
watched
him
at
meals
had
seen
him
sit
in
bewildered
grief
striving
for
and
hope
had
seen
him
as
the
light
faded
in
the
parlour
upstairs
sink
deeper
into
himself
his
eyes
hidden
by
his
hand
and
his
grey
pointed
beard
twitching
at
the
trembling
of
his
mouth
once
or
twice
she
had
met
his
eyes
fixed
on
hers
in
a
questioning
stare
and
had
known
what
was
in
his
heart
a
simple
unreproachful
wonder
at
the
strange
events
that
had
made
her
so
intimately
responsible
for
his
son
happiness
she
thought
of
margaret
too
as
she
sat
there
of
the
poor
girl
who
had
so
rested
on
her
believed
in
her
loved
her
there
she
was
now
at
overfield
living
in
a
nightmare
of
suspense
watching
so
eagerly
for
the
scanty
letters
disappointed
every
time
of
the
good
news
for
which
she
hoped
the
burden
was
an
intolerable
one
beatrice
was
scarcely
conscious
of
where
she
sat
or
for
what
she
waited
she
was
living
over
again
every
detail
of
her
relations
with
ralph
she
remembered
how
she
had
seen
him
at
first
at
chelsea
how
he
had
come
out
with
master
more
from
the
door
of
the
new
building
and
across
the
grass
she
had
been
twisting
a
then
as
she
listened
to
the
talk
and
had
tossed
it
on
to
the
dog
back
then
day
by
day
she
had
met
him
he
had
come
at
all
hours
and
she
had
watched
him
for
she
thought
she
had
found
a
man
she
remembered
how
her
interest
had
deepened
how
suddenly
her
heart
had
leapt
that
evening
when
she
came
into
the
hall
and
found
him
sitting
in
the
dark
then
step
by
step
the
friendship
had
grown
till
it
had
revealed
its
radiant
face
at
the
bitterness
of
chris
words
in
the
house
at
westminster
then
her
life
had
become
magical
all
the
world
cried
ralph
to
her
the
trumpets
she
heard
sounded
to
his
praise
the
sunsets
had
shone
for
him
and
her
then
came
the
news
of
the
work
and
her
heart
had
begun
to
question
her
insistently
the
questions
had
become
affirmation
and
in
one
passionate
hour
she
had
gone
to
him
scourged
him
with
her
tongue
and
left
him
she
had
seen
him
again
once
or
twice
in
the
years
that
followed
had
watched
him
from
a
window
hung
with
tapestries
in
cheapside
as
he
rode
down
beside
the
king
and
had
not
dared
to
ask
herself
what
her
heart
so
longed
to
tell
her
then
had
come
the
mother
question
and
the
falling
of
the
veils
then
he
had
called
her
she
never
doubted
that
as
she
sat
alone
in
her
room
one
evening
it
had
come
thin
and
piteous
beatrice
beatrice
he
needed
her
and
she
had
gone
and
meddled
with
his
life
once
more
and
he
lay
in
the
tower
beatrice
my
child
she
turned
from
the
window
her
eyes
blind
with
tears
and
in
a
moment
was
kneeling
at
her
aunt
side
her
face
buried
in
her
lap
and
felt
those
kindly
old
hands
passing
over
her
hair
she
heard
a
murmur
over
her
head
but
scarcely
caught
a
word
there
was
but
one
thing
she
needed
and
that
then
she
knelt
suddenly
upright
listening
and
the
caressing
hand
was
still
beatrice
my
dear
beatrice
there
were
footsteps
on
the
stairs
outside
eager
and
urgent
the
girl
rose
to
her
feet
and
stood
there
swaying
a
little
with
a
restrained
expectation
then
the
door
was
open
and
chris
was
there
flushed
and
radiant
with
the
level
evening
light
full
on
his
face
it
is
all
well
he
cried
my
lord
will
take
us
to
the
king
chapter
x
placentia
the
of
greenwich
house
was
a
magnificent
sight
as
the
four
men
came
up
to
it
one
morning
nearly
three
weeks
later
the
long
row
of
brick
buildings
which
henry
had
named
placentia
with
their
lines
of
windows
broken
by
the
two
clusters
of
slender
towers
and
porticos
beneath
were
fronted
by
broad
platforms
and
a
strip
of
turf
with
steps
leading
down
to
the
water
and
at
each
of
these
entrances
there
continually
moved
brilliant
figures
sentries
with
the
sunlight
flashing
on
their
steel
caps
and
servants
in
the
royal
livery
watermen
in
their
blue
and
badges
here
and
there
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
rocked
gaudy
barges
a
mass
of
gilding
and
colour
with
broad
low
canopies
at
the
stern
and
flags
drooping
at
the
prow
wherries
moved
to
and
fro
like
shooting
across
from
bank
to
bank
with
passengers
above
and
below
the
palace
or
pausing
with
uplifted
oars
as
the
stream
swept
them
down
for
the
visitors
to
stare
and
marvel
at
the
great
buildings
behind
rose
up
the
green
masses
of
trees
against
the
sloping
park
and
over
all
lay
the
july
sky
solemn
flakes
of
cloud
drifting
across
a
field
of
intense
blue
there
had
been
a
delay
in
the
fulfilment
of
the
archbishop
promise
at
one
time
he
himself
was
away
in
the
country
on
affairs
at
another
time
the
king
was
too
much
pressed
cranmer
reported
to
have
such
a
matter
brought
before
him
and
then
suddenly
a
messenger
had
come
across
from
lambeth
with
a
letter
bidding
them
present
themselves
at
greenwich
on
the
following
morning
for
the
day
following
that
had
been
fixed
for
cromwell
execution
and
the
archbishop
hoped
that
the
king
would
be
ready
to
hear
a
word
on
behalf
of
the
agent
whose
loyalty
had
failed
to
save
his
master
the
boatman
suddenly
backed
water
with
his
oar
took
a
stroke
or
two
with
his
right
glancing
over
his
shoulder
and
the
boat
slid
up
to
the
foot
of
the
steps
a
couple
of
watermen
were
already
waiting
there
in
the
livery
and
steadied
the
boat
for
the
four
gentlemen
to
step
out
and
a
moment
later
the
four
were
standing
on
the
platform
looking
about
them
they
were
at
one
of
the
smaller
entrances
to
the
palace
a
hundred
yards
further
down
was
the
royal
entrance
canopied
and
carpeted
with
the
king
barge
rocking
at
the
foot
a
number
of
servants
coming
and
going
on
the
platform
and
the
great
state
windows
overlooking
all
but
here
they
were
in
comparative
quiet
a
small
doorway
with
its
buff
and
sentry
before
it
opened
on
their
right
into
the
interior
of
the
palace
one
of
the
watermen
saluted
the
party
master
torridon
he
said
chris
assented
my
lord
bade
me
take
you
through
to
him
sir
as
soon
as
you
arrived
he
went
before
them
to
the
door
said
a
word
to
the
guard
and
then
the
party
passed
on
through
the
little
into
the
interior
the
corridor
was
plainly
and
severely
furnished
with
matting
chairs
here
and
there
set
along
the
wainscot
pieces
of
stuff
with
crossed
pikes
between
hanging
on
the
walls
through
the
bow
windows
they
caught
a
glimpse
now
and
again
of
a
little
court
or
two
a
shrubbery
and
a
piece
of
lawn
and
once
a
vista
of
the
park
where
henry
in
his
younger
days
used
to
hold
his
a
gallant
and
princely
figure
all
in
green
from
cap
to
shoes
breakfasting
beneath
the
trees
continually
as
they
went
first
in
the
corridor
and
then
through
the
waiting
rooms
at
the
end
they
passed
others
going
to
and
fro
servants
hurrying
on
messages
leisurely
and
magnificent
persons
with
their
hats
on
pages
standing
outside
closed
doors
and
twice
they
were
asked
their
business
for
my
lord
of
canterbury
answered
the
waterman
each
time
it
seemed
to
chris
that
they
must
have
gone
an
immense
distance
before
the
waterman
at
last
stopped
motioning
them
to
go
on
and
a
page
in
purple
livery
stepped
forward
from
a
door
for
my
lord
of
canterbury
said
the
waterman
for
the
last
time
the
page
bowed
turned
and
threw
open
the
door
they
found
themselves
in
a
square
parlour
carpeted
and
hung
with
tapestries
from
floor
to
ceiling
a
second
door
opened
beyond
in
the
window
side
into
another
room
a
round
table
stood
in
the
centre
with
brocaded
chairs
about
it
and
a
long
couch
by
the
fireplace
opposite
rose
up
the
tall
windows
through
which
shone
the
bright
river
with
the
trees
and
buildings
on
the
north
bank
beyond
they
had
hardly
spoken
a
word
to
one
another
since
they
had
left
charing
for
all
that
was
possible
had
been
said
during
the
weeks
of
waiting
for
the
archbishop
summons
cranmer
had
received
them
kindly
though
he
had
not
committed
himself
beyond
promising
to
introduce
them
to
the
king
and
had
expressed
no
opinion
on
the
case
he
had
listened
to
them
courteously
had
nodded
quietly
as
chris
explained
what
it
was
that
ralph
had
done
and
then
almost
without
comment
had
given
his
promise
it
seemed
as
if
the
archbishop
could
not
even
form
an
opinion
and
still
less
express
one
until
he
had
heard
what
his
highness
had
to
say
chris
walked
to
the
window
and
the
lawyer
followed
him
placentia
said
herries
i
do
not
wonder
at
it
it
is
even
more
pleasing
from
within
he
stood
a
prim
black
figure
looking
out
at
the
glorious
view
the
shining
waterway
studded
with
spots
of
colour
the
long
bank
of
the
river
opposite
and
the
spires
of
london
city
lying
in
a
blue
far
away
to
the
left
chris
stared
at
it
too
but
with
unseeing
eyes
it
seemed
as
if
all
power
of
sensation
had
left
him
the
suspense
of
the
last
weeks
had
corroded
the
surfaces
of
his
soul
and
the
intensity
to
which
it
was
now
rising
seemed
to
have
paralysed
what
was
left
he
found
himself
picturing
the
little
house
at
charing
where
beatrice
was
waiting
and
he
knew
praying
and
he
reminded
himself
that
the
next
time
he
saw
her
he
would
know
all
whether
death
or
life
was
to
be
ralph
sentence
the
solemn
quiet
and
the
air
of
rich
and
comfortable
tranquillity
which
the
palace
wore
and
which
had
impressed
itself
on
his
mind
even
in
the
hundred
yards
he
had
walked
in
it
gave
him
an
added
sense
of
what
it
was
that
lay
over
his
brother
the
huge
passionless
forces
with
which
he
had
become
entangled
then
he
turned
round
his
father
was
sitting
at
the
table
his
head
on
his
hand
and
nicholas
was
staring
round
the
grave
room
with
the
solemnity
of
a
child
looking
strangely
rustic
and
out
of
place
in
these
surroundings
it
was
very
quiet
as
chris
leaned
against
the
in
his
secular
habit
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
and
looked
once
a
footstep
passed
in
the
corridor
outside
and
the
floor
vibrated
slightly
to
the
tread
once
a
horn
blew
somewhere
far
away
and
from
the
river
now
and
again
came
the
cry
of
a
waterman
or
the
throb
of
oars
in
rowlocks
sir
james
looked
up
once
opened
his
lips
as
if
to
speak
and
then
dropped
his
head
on
to
his
hand
again
the
waiting
seemed
interminable
chris
turned
round
to
the
window
once
more
slipped
his
breviary
out
of
his
pocket
and
opened
it
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
began
in
nomine
patris
et
filii
then
the
second
door
opened
he
turned
back
abruptly
there
was
a
rustle
of
silk
and
the
archbishop
came
through
in
his
habit
and
gown
chris
bowed
slightly
as
the
prelate
went
past
him
briskly
towards
the
table
where
sir
james
was
now
standing
up
and
searched
his
features
eagerly
for
an
omen
there
was
nothing
to
be
read
there
his
smooth
face
was
smiling
quietly
as
its
manner
was
and
his
wide
lips
were
slightly
parted
master
torridon
you
are
in
good
time
i
am
just
come
from
his
highness
and
will
take
you
to
him
directly
chris
saw
his
father
face
blanch
a
little
as
he
bowed
in
return
nicholas
merely
stared
but
we
have
a
few
minutes
went
on
the
archbishop
sir
thomas
wriothesly
is
with
him
tell
me
again
sir
what
you
wish
me
to
say
sir
james
looked
hesitatingly
to
the
lawyer
herries
he
said
cranmer
turned
round
and
again
made
that
little
bow
to
the
priest
and
the
lawyer
herries
stepped
forward
as
cranmer
sat
down
clasping
his
hands
so
that
the
great
amethyst
showed
on
his
slender
finger
it
is
this
my
lord
he
said
it
is
as
we
told
your
lordship
at
lambeth
this
gentleman
desires
the
king
clemency
towards
ralph
torridon
now
in
the
tower
torridon
has
served
er
cromwell
very
faithfully
we
wish
to
make
no
secret
of
that
he
destroyed
certain
private
papers
though
that
can
not
be
proved
against
him
and
you
will
remember
that
we
were
doubtful
whether
his
highness
should
be
informed
of
that
sir
james
broke
in
suddenly
i
have
been
thinking
of
that
my
lord
i
would
sooner
that
the
grace
knew
everything
i
have
no
wish
that
that
should
be
kept
from
him
the
archbishop
who
had
been
looking
with
smiling
attention
from
one
to
the
other
now
himself
broke
in
i
am
glad
you
think
that
sir
i
think
so
myself
though
it
can
not
be
proved
as
you
say
it
is
far
best
that
his
grace
should
know
all
indeed
i
think
i
should
have
told
him
in
any
case
then
my
lord
if
you
think
well
went
on
herries
you
might
lay
before
his
grace
that
this
is
a
free
and
open
confession
torridon
did
burn
papers
and
important
ones
but
they
would
not
have
served
anything
master
cromwell
was
cast
without
them
but
torridon
did
not
know
that
questioned
the
archbishop
blandly
yes
my
lord
cried
sir
james
he
must
have
known
that
my
lord
cromwell
the
archbishop
lifted
his
hand
delicately
master
cromwell
he
corrected
master
cromwell
went
on
the
old
man
he
must
have
known
that
cromwell
had
others
more
important
that
would
be
certainly
found
and
used
against
him
then
why
did
he
burn
them
you
understand
sir
that
i
only
wish
to
know
what
i
have
to
say
to
his
grace
he
burned
them
my
lord
because
he
could
not
bear
that
his
hand
should
be
lifted
against
his
master
surely
that
is
but
loyal
and
good
the
archbishop
nodded
quietly
three
or
four
times
and
you
desire
that
his
grace
will
take
order
to
have
torridon
released
that
is
it
my
lord
said
the
lawyer
yes
i
understand
and
can
you
give
any
pledge
for
torridon
good
behaviour
he
has
served
cromwell
answered
the
lawyer
very
well
for
many
years
he
has
been
with
him
in
the
matter
of
the
religious
houses
he
was
one
of
the
king
visitors
and
assisted
in
the
the
destruction
of
lewes
priory
and
that
my
lord
is
a
sufficient
sir
james
gave
a
sudden
sob
herries
herries
cranmer
turned
to
him
smiling
i
know
what
you
feel
sir
he
said
but
if
this
is
true
why
it
is
true
god
help
him
cried
the
old
man
then
that
is
what
we
need
sir
as
you
said
just
now
yes
mr
herries
the
lawyer
glanced
at
the
old
man
again
that
is
sufficient
guarantee
my
lord
that
ralph
torridon
is
no
enemy
of
his
grace
projects
i
can
not
bear
that
cried
sir
james
nicholas
who
had
been
looking
awed
and
from
one
to
the
other
took
him
by
the
arm
you
must
father
he
said
it
it
is
devilish
but
it
is
true
chris
have
you
nothing
the
monk
came
forward
a
step
it
is
true
my
lord
he
said
i
was
a
monk
of
lewes
myself
and
you
have
conformed
put
in
the
archbishop
swiftly
i
am
living
at
home
peaceably
said
chris
it
is
true
that
my
brother
did
all
this
but
but
my
father
wishes
that
it
should
not
be
used
in
his
cause
if
it
is
true
said
the
archbishop
it
is
best
to
say
it
we
want
nothing
but
the
bare
truth
but
i
can
not
bear
it
cried
the
old
man
again
chris
came
round
behind
the
archbishop
to
his
father
will
you
leave
it
father
to
my
lord
archbishop
my
lord
understands
what
we
think
sir
james
looked
at
him
dazed
and
bewildered
god
help
us
do
you
think
so
chris
i
think
so
father
my
lord
you
understand
all
the
archbishop
bowed
again
slightly
then
my
lord
we
will
leave
it
all
in
your
hands
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
the
archbishop
rose
that
is
our
signal
he
said
come
gentlemen
his
grace
will
be
ready
immediately
herries
sprang
to
the
door
and
opened
it
bowing
as
the
archbishop
went
through
followed
by
sir
james
and
nicholas
he
and
chris
followed
after
there
was
a
kind
of
dull
recklessness
in
the
monk
heart
as
he
went
through
he
knew
that
he
was
in
more
peril
than
any
of
the
others
and
yet
he
did
not
fear
it
the
faculty
of
fear
had
been
blunted
not
sharpened
by
his
experiences
and
he
passed
on
towards
the
presence
almost
without
a
tremor
the
room
was
empty
except
for
a
page
by
the
further
door
who
opened
it
as
the
party
advanced
and
beyond
was
a
wide
lobby
with
doors
all
round
and
a
staircase
on
the
right
as
they
came
out
the
archbishop
made
a
little
motion
to
the
others
as
he
went
up
gathering
his
skirts
about
him
and
acknowledging
with
his
disengaged
hand
the
salute
of
the
sentry
that
stood
in
the
lobby
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
was
a
broad
landing
then
a
corridor
through
which
they
passed
and
on
they
turned
to
the
left
and
as
they
went
it
was
apparent
that
they
were
near
the
royal
apartments
there
were
thick
leather
rugs
lying
here
and
there
along
the
walls
stood
magnificent
pieces
of
furniture
inlaid
tables
with
tall
upon
them
suits
of
venetian
armour
elaborately
worked
in
silver
and
at
the
door
of
every
room
that
opened
on
the
corridor
there
was
standing
a
sentry
or
a
servant
who
straightened
themselves
at
the
sight
of
the
archbishop
he
carefully
acknowledged
each
salutation
and
nodded
kindly
once
or
twice
there
was
a
heavy
odour
in
the
air
warm
and
fragrant
as
of
mingled
stuffs
and
musk
which
even
the
wide
windows
set
open
towards
the
garden
on
the
right
hand
did
not
wholly
obliterate
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
charing
chris
heart
quickened
the
slow
stages
of
approach
to
the
formidable
presence
had
begun
to
do
their
work
if
he
had
seen
the
king
at
once
he
would
not
have
been
moved
if
he
had
had
an
hour
longer
he
would
have
recovered
from
his
emotion
but
this
swift
ordered
approach
the
suggestiveness
of
the
thick
carpets
and
furniture
the
sight
of
the
silent
figures
waiting
the
musky
smell
in
the
air
all
combined
now
to
work
upon
him
he
began
to
fancy
that
he
was
drawing
nearer
the
presence
of
some
great
that
had
made
its
den
here
that
was
guarded
by
these
discreet
servitors
and
to
which
this
smooth
prelate
in
the
rôle
of
the
principal
keeper
was
guiding
him
any
of
these
before
him
might
mark
the
sanctuary
of
the
labyrinth
where
the
creature
lurked
one
might
open
and
a
savage
face
look
out
dripping
blood
and
slaver
a
page
threw
back
a
door
at
last
and
they
passed
through
but
again
there
was
a
check
it
was
but
one
more
waiting
room
the
dozen
persons
folks
of
all
sorts
a
lawyer
a
soldier
and
others
stood
up
and
bowed
to
the
prelate
then
the
party
sat
down
near
the
further
door
in
dead
silence
and
the
minutes
began
to
pass
there
were
cries
from
the
river
once
or
twice
as
they
waited
once
a
footstep
vibrated
through
the
door
and
twice
a
murmur
of
voices
sounded
and
died
again
then
suddenly
a
hand
was
laid
on
the
handle
from
the
other
side
and
the
archbishop
rose
with
sir
james
beside
him
there
was
still
a
pause
then
a
voice
sounded
loud
and
near
and
there
was
a
general
movement
in
the
room
as
all
rose
to
their
feet
the
door
swung
open
and
the
garter
came
through
bland
and
smiling
his
puffed
silk
sleeves
brushing
against
the
doorpost
as
he
passed
a
face
like
a
mask
smooth
and
expressionless
followed
him
and
nodded
to
the
archbishop
cranmer
turned
slightly
to
his
party
again
made
that
little
movement
and
went
straight
through
chris
followed
with
herries
chapter
xi
the
king
highness
as
chris
knelt
with
the
others
and
the
door
closed
behind
him
he
was
aware
of
a
great
room
with
a
tall
window
looking
on
to
the
river
on
his
left
walls
a
broad
table
heaped
with
papers
in
the
centre
a
high
beamed
ceiling
and
the
thick
carpet
under
his
knees
for
a
moment
he
did
not
see
the
king
the
page
who
had
beckoned
them
in
had
passed
across
the
room
and
chris
eyes
followed
him
out
through
an
inner
door
in
the
corner
then
still
on
his
knees
he
turned
his
eyes
to
see
the
archbishop
going
towards
the
window
and
up
the
step
that
led
on
to
the
dais
that
occupied
the
floor
of
the
oriel
then
he
saw
the
king
a
great
figure
was
seated
opposite
the
side
door
at
which
they
had
entered
on
the
broad
seat
that
ran
round
the
three
sides
of
the
window
the
puffed
sleeves
made
the
shoulders
look
enormous
a
gold
chain
lay
across
them
with
which
the
gross
fingers
were
playing
beneath
the
vast
stomach
swelled
out
into
the
slashed
trunks
and
the
scarlet
legs
were
crossed
one
over
the
other
on
the
head
lay
a
broad
plumed
velvet
cap
and
beneath
it
was
the
wide
square
face
at
once
jovial
and
solemn
with
the
narrow
slits
of
eyes
above
and
the
little
pursed
mouth
fringed
by
reddish
hair
below
that
chris
remembered
in
the
barge
years
before
the
smell
of
musk
lay
heavy
in
the
air
here
was
the
monstrous
then
at
last
sunning
himself
and
waiting
so
the
party
rested
a
moment
or
two
while
the
archbishop
went
across
to
the
dais
he
knelt
again
and
then
stood
up
and
said
a
word
or
two
rapidly
that
chris
could
not
hear
henry
nodded
and
turned
his
bright
narrow
eyes
on
to
them
and
then
made
a
motion
with
his
hand
the
archbishop
turned
round
and
repeated
the
gesture
and
chris
rose
in
his
place
as
did
the
others
master
torridon
your
grace
explained
the
archbishop
with
a
deferential
stoop
of
his
shoulders
your
grace
will
remember
the
king
nodded
abruptly
and
thrust
his
hand
out
chris
touched
his
father
behind
go
forward
he
whispered
kiss
hands
the
old
man
went
forward
a
hesitating
step
or
two
the
archbishop
motioned
sharply
and
sir
james
advanced
again
up
to
the
dais
sank
down
and
lifted
the
hand
to
his
lips
and
fell
back
for
the
others
when
chris
turn
came
and
he
lifted
the
heavy
fingers
he
noticed
for
a
moment
a
wonderful
red
stone
on
the
thumb
and
recognised
it
it
was
the
regal
of
france
that
he
had
seen
years
before
at
his
visit
to
thomas
shrine
at
canterbury
in
a
flash
too
he
remembered
crest
as
he
had
seen
it
on
the
papers
at
lewes
the
holding
up
the
ring
then
he
too
had
fallen
back
and
the
archbishop
was
speaking
your
grace
will
remember
that
there
is
a
ralph
torridon
in
the
tower
an
agent
of
cromwell
the
king
face
moved
slightly
but
he
said
nothing
who
is
awaiting
trial
for
destroying
evidence
it
is
that
at
least
your
grace
that
is
asserted
against
him
but
it
has
not
been
proved
master
torridon
here
tells
me
your
highness
that
it
can
not
be
proved
but
that
he
wishes
to
acknowledge
it
freely
on
his
son
behalf
henry
eyes
shot
back
again
at
the
old
man
ran
over
the
others
and
settled
again
on
cranmer
face
who
was
standing
beside
him
with
his
back
to
the
window
he
is
here
to
plead
for
your
grace
clemency
he
wishes
to
lay
before
your
grace
that
his
son
erred
through
to
cromwell
cause
and
above
all
that
the
evidence
so
destroyed
has
not
affected
the
course
of
justice
god
body
jarred
in
the
harsh
voice
suddenly
it
has
not
nor
shall
it
cranmer
waited
a
moment
with
downcast
eyes
but
the
king
was
silent
again
master
torridon
has
persuaded
me
to
come
with
him
to
your
grace
to
speak
for
him
he
is
not
accustomed
and
who
are
these
fellows
chris
felt
those
keen
eyes
running
over
him
this
is
master
nicholas
maxwell
explained
the
archbishop
indicating
him
master
torridon
and
this
herries
and
the
priest
asked
the
king
the
priest
is
sir
christopher
torridon
living
with
his
father
at
overfield
ha
has
he
always
lived
there
then
no
your
grace
said
cranmer
smoothly
he
was
a
monk
at
lewes
until
the
dissolution
of
the
house
i
have
heard
somewhat
of
his
name
mused
henry
what
is
it
sir
that
i
have
beard
of
you
it
was
perhaps
ralph
torridon
name
that
your
grace
began
cranmer
nay
nay
it
was
not
what
was
it
sir
chris
heart
was
beating
in
his
ears
like
a
drum
now
it
had
come
then
that
peril
that
had
always
been
brooding
on
the
horizon
and
which
he
had
begun
to
despise
he
had
thought
that
there
could
be
no
danger
in
his
going
to
the
king
it
was
so
long
since
lewes
had
fallen
and
his
own
part
had
been
so
small
but
his
grace
memory
was
good
it
seemed
danger
was
close
to
him
incarnate
in
that
overwhelming
presence
he
said
nothing
but
stood
awaiting
detection
it
is
strange
said
henry
i
have
forgot
well
my
lord
i
have
told
your
grace
all
explained
the
archbishop
ralph
torridon
has
not
yet
been
brought
to
trial
and
his
father
hopes
that
your
grace
will
take
into
consideration
these
two
things
that
it
was
a
mistake
of
that
his
son
committed
and
that
it
has
not
hindered
the
course
of
justice
well
well
said
henry
and
that
sounds
to
be
in
reason
we
have
none
too
much
of
either
faithfulness
or
justice
in
these
days
and
there
is
no
other
charge
against
the
fellow
there
is
no
other
charge
your
grace
there
fell
a
complete
silence
for
a
moment
or
two
chris
glanced
up
at
his
father
his
own
heart
uplifted
by
hope
and
saw
the
old
man
face
trembling
with
it
too
the
wrinkled
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
his
lips
quivered
and
chris
could
feel
the
short
cloak
that
hung
against
him
shaking
at
his
hand
nicholas
crimson
face
showed
a
mingling
of
such
emotion
and
solemnity
that
chris
was
seized
with
an
internal
hysterical
spasm
but
it
suddenly
died
within
him
as
he
brought
his
eyes
round
and
saw
that
the
king
was
staring
at
him
moodily
the
archbishop
voice
broke
in
again
are
we
to
understand
your
grace
that
your
grace
clemency
is
extended
to
ralph
torridon
eh
then
said
the
king
peevishly
hold
your
tongue
my
lord
i
am
trying
to
remember
where
is
michael
shall
i
call
him
your
grace
nay
then
let
the
lawyer
ring
the
bell
herries
sprang
to
the
table
at
the
king
gesture
and
struck
the
little
that
stood
there
the
door
where
the
page
had
disappeared
five
minutes
before
opened
silently
and
the
servant
stood
there
michael
said
the
king
and
the
page
vanished
there
was
an
uncomfortable
silence
cranmer
stood
back
a
little
with
an
air
of
patient
deference
and
his
quick
eyes
glanced
up
now
and
again
at
the
party
before
him
there
was
a
certain
uneasiness
in
his
manner
as
chris
could
see
but
the
monk
presently
dropped
his
eyes
again
as
he
saw
that
the
king
was
once
more
looking
at
him
keenly
with
tight
pursed
lips
and
a
puzzled
look
on
his
forehead
the
thoughts
began
to
race
through
chris
brain
he
found
himself
praying
with
desperate
speed
that
michael
whoever
he
was
might
not
know
and
that
the
king
might
not
remember
and
meanwhile
through
another
part
of
his
being
ran
the
thought
of
the
irony
of
his
situation
here
he
was
come
to
plead
for
his
brother
life
and
on
the
brink
of
having
to
plead
for
his
own
the
quiet
room
increased
his
sense
of
the
irony
it
seemed
so
safe
and
strong
and
comfortable
up
here
in
the
rich
room
with
the
tall
window
looking
on
to
the
sunlit
river
in
a
palace
girt
about
with
guards
and
yet
the
very
security
of
it
was
his
danger
he
had
penetrated
into
the
stronghold
of
the
great
beast
that
ruled
england
he
was
within
striking
distance
of
those
claws
and
teeth
then
suddenly
the
creature
stirred
and
snarled
i
know
it
now
sir
you
were
one
of
the
knaves
that
would
not
sign
the
surrender
of
lewes
chris
lifted
his
eyes
and
dropped
them
again
god
body
said
the
king
and
you
come
here
again
there
was
silence
chris
saw
his
father
half
turn
towards
him
with
a
piteous
face
and
perceived
that
the
lawyer
had
drawn
a
little
away
the
king
turned
abruptly
to
cranmer
did
you
know
this
my
lord
before
god
i
did
not
but
his
voice
shook
as
he
answered
chris
was
gripping
his
courage
and
at
last
spoke
we
were
told
it
was
a
act
your
grace
henry
said
nothing
to
this
his
eyes
were
rolling
up
and
down
the
figure
with
tight
thoughtful
lips
cranmer
looked
desperately
at
sir
james
i
did
not
know
that
your
grace
he
said
again
i
only
knew
that
this
priest
brother
had
been
very
active
in
your
grace
business
henry
turned
sharply
eh
he
said
sir
james
hands
rose
and
clasped
themselves
instinctively
cranmer
again
looked
at
him
almost
fiercely
ralph
torridon
was
one
of
the
visitors
explained
the
archbishop
nervously
and
this
fellow
a
monk
cried
the
king
they
must
have
met
at
lewes
your
grace
ah
my
lord
cried
sir
james
suddenly
i
entreated
you
henry
turned
on
him
suddenly
tell
us
the
tale
sir
what
is
all
this
sir
james
took
a
faltering
step
forward
and
then
suddenly
threw
out
his
hands
ah
your
grace
it
is
a
bitter
tale
for
a
father
to
tell
it
is
true
all
of
it
my
son
here
was
a
monk
at
lewes
he
would
not
sign
the
surrender
i
i
approved
him
for
it
i
i
was
there
when
my
son
ralph
cast
him
out
god
blood
cried
the
king
with
a
beaming
face
the
one
brother
cast
the
other
out
chris
saw
the
archbishop
face
suddenly
lighten
as
he
watched
the
king
sideways
but
i
can
not
bear
that
he
should
be
saved
for
that
went
on
the
old
man
piteously
he
was
a
good
servant
to
your
grace
but
a
bad
one
to
our
lord
the
archbishop
drew
a
swift
breath
of
horror
and
his
hands
jerked
but
henry
seemed
not
to
hear
his
little
mouth
had
opened
in
a
round
hole
of
amazed
laughter
and
he
was
staring
at
the
old
man
without
hearing
him
and
you
were
there
he
said
and
your
wife
and
your
aunts
and
sisters
my
wife
is
dead
cried
the
old
man
your
grace
and
on
which
side
was
she
she
was
was
on
your
grace
side
henry
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
for
one
moment
chris
did
not
know
whether
it
was
wrath
or
laughter
that
shook
him
his
face
grew
crimson
and
his
narrow
eyes
disappeared
into
shining
slits
his
fat
hands
were
on
his
knees
and
his
great
body
shook
from
his
round
open
mouth
came
silent
gusts
of
quick
breath
and
he
began
to
sway
a
little
from
side
to
side
across
the
archbishop
face
came
a
deferential
and
sympathetic
smile
and
he
looked
quickly
and
nervously
from
the
king
to
the
group
and
back
again
sir
james
had
fallen
back
a
pace
at
the
king
laughter
and
stood
rigid
and
staring
chris
took
a
step
close
to
him
and
gripped
his
hand
firmly
there
was
a
footstep
behind
and
the
king
leaned
forward
again
wiping
the
tears
away
with
his
sleeve
oh
michael
michael
he
sobbed
here
is
a
fine
tale
a
man
stepped
forward
from
behind
and
stood
expectant
god
what
a
happy
family
said
the
king
and
this
fellow
here
he
motioned
towards
nicholas
with
a
feeble
gesture
he
was
still
weak
with
laughter
the
young
squire
moved
forward
a
step
rigid
and
indignant
i
am
against
your
grace
he
said
sharply
henry
grew
suddenly
grave
eh
that
is
no
way
to
speak
he
said
it
is
the
only
way
i
can
speak
said
nicholas
if
your
grace
desires
the
truth
the
king
looked
at
him
a
moment
but
the
humour
still
shone
in
his
eyes
well
well
it
is
the
truth
i
want
michael
i
sent
for
you
to
know
about
the
priest
here
but
i
know
now
and
is
it
true
that
his
brother
in
the
tower
ralph
torridon
was
one
of
the
visitors
the
man
pursed
his
lips
a
moment
he
was
standing
close
to
chris
a
little
in
front
of
him
yes
your
majesty
oh
well
we
must
let
him
out
i
suppose
if
there
is
nothing
more
against
him
you
shall
tell
me
presently
michael
the
archbishop
looked
swiftly
across
at
the
party
then
your
grace
extends
well
michael
what
is
it
interrupted
the
king
it
is
a
matter
your
majesty
might
wish
to
hear
in
private
said
the
stranger
oh
step
aside
my
lord
and
you
gentlemen
the
king
motioned
down
to
the
further
end
of
the
room
as
michael
came
forward
the
archbishop
stepped
off
the
low
platform
and
led
the
way
down
the
floor
and
the
others
followed
chris
was
in
a
whirl
of
bewilderment
he
could
see
the
king
great
face
interested
and
attentive
as
the
secretary
said
something
in
his
ear
and
then
suddenly
light
up
with
amusement
again
not
a
word
not
a
word
whispered
henry
harshly
very
good
michael
the
secretary
then
whispered
once
more
chris
could
hear
the
sharp
sibilants
but
no
word
the
king
nodded
once
more
and
the
man
stepped
down
off
the
dais
prepare
the
admission
then
said
the
king
after
him
the
secretary
bowed
as
he
turned
and
went
out
of
the
room
once
more
henry
beckoned
come
gentlemen
he
watched
them
with
a
solemn
joviality
as
they
came
up
the
archbishop
in
front
the
father
and
son
together
and
the
two
others
behind
you
are
a
sad
crew
began
the
king
eyeing
them
pleasantly
and
sitting
forward
with
a
hand
on
either
knee
and
i
am
astonished
my
lord
of
canterbury
at
your
companying
with
them
but
we
will
have
mercy
and
remember
your
son
services
master
torridon
in
the
past
that
alone
will
excuse
him
remember
that
that
alone
he
is
the
stronger
man
if
he
turned
out
the
priest
there
and
i
remember
your
son
very
well
too
and
will
forgive
him
but
i
shall
not
employ
him
again
and
his
forgiveness
shall
cover
yours
master
priest
but
you
must
be
off
you
must
be
off
sir
he
barked
suddenly
out
of
these
realms
in
a
week
we
will
have
no
more
treason
from
you
the
fierce
overpowering
personality
flared
out
as
he
spoke
and
chris
felt
his
heart
beat
sick
at
the
force
of
it
and
you
two
gentlemen
went
on
the
king
still
smouldering
you
two
had
best
hold
your
tongues
we
will
not
hear
such
talk
in
our
presence
or
out
of
it
but
we
will
excuse
it
now
there
sir
have
i
said
enough
sir
james
dropped
abruptly
on
his
knees
oh
god
bless
your
grace
he
began
with
the
tears
running
down
henry
made
an
abrupt
gesture
you
shall
go
to
your
son
he
said
and
see
how
he
fares
and
tell
him
this
and
she
shall
have
the
order
of
release
presently
from
me
or
another
again
the
little
mouth
creased
and
twitched
with
amusement
and
i
hope
he
will
be
happy
with
his
mother
you
may
tell
him
that
from
me
the
archbishop
looked
up
mistress
torridon
is
dead
your
grace
he
said
softly
and
questioningly
oh
well
said
the
king
and
thrust
out
his
hand
to
be
kissed
chris
did
not
know
how
they
got
out
of
the
room
they
kissed
hands
again
the
old
man
muttered
out
his
thanks
but
he
seemed
bewildered
by
the
rush
of
events
and
the
supreme
surprise
chris
as
he
backed
away
from
the
presence
saw
for
the
last
time
those
narrow
royal
eyes
fixed
on
him
still
bright
with
amusement
and
expectancy
and
the
great
cheeks
creased
about
the
tiny
mouth
with
an
effort
to
keep
back
laughter
why
was
the
king
laughing
he
wondered
they
waited
a
few
minutes
in
the
for
the
order
that
the
archbishop
had
whispered
to
them
should
be
sent
out
immediately
they
said
nothing
to
one
another
but
the
three
sat
close
looking
into
one
another
eyes
now
and
again
in
astonishment
and
joy
while
herries
stood
a
little
apart
solemn
and
happy
at
the
importance
of
the
rôle
he
had
played
in
the
whole
affair
and
disdaining
even
to
look
at
the
rest
of
the
company
who
sat
on
chairs
and
watched
the
party
the
secretary
came
to
them
in
a
few
minutes
and
handed
them
the
order
my
lord
of
canterbury
is
detained
he
said
he
bade
me
tell
you
gentlemen
that
he
could
not
see
you
again
sir
james
was
standing
up
and
examining
the
order
for
four
he
said
why
yes
said
the
secretary
and
glanced
at
the
four
men
chris
put
his
hand
on
his
father
arm
it
is
all
well
he
whispered
say
nothing
more
it
will
do
for
beatrice
chapter
xii
the
tidings
at
the
tower
they
debated
as
they
stood
on
the
steps
in
the
sunlight
five
minutes
later
as
to
whether
they
should
go
straight
to
the
tower
or
back
to
charing
and
take
beatrice
with
them
they
spoke
softly
to
one
another
as
men
that
have
come
out
from
darkness
to
light
bewildered
by
the
sense
of
freedom
and
freshness
that
lay
round
them
instead
of
the
rooms
the
formidable
dominating
presence
the
suspense
and
the
terror
the
river
laughed
before
them
the
fresh
summer
breeze
blew
up
it
and
above
all
ralph
was
free
and
that
not
only
of
his
prison
but
of
his
hateful
work
it
had
all
been
done
in
those
few
sentences
but
as
yet
they
could
not
realise
it
and
they
regarded
it
as
they
regarded
the
ripples
at
their
feet
the
lapping
wherry
and
london
city
as
a
kind
of
dazzling
picture
which
would
by
and
bye
be
found
to
move
and
live
the
lawyer
congratulated
them
and
they
smiled
back
and
thanked
him
if
you
will
put
me
to
shore
at
london
bridge
said
herries
i
have
a
little
business
i
might
do
there
that
is
if
you
will
be
going
so
far
chris
looked
at
his
father
whose
arm
he
was
holding
we
must
take
her
with
us
he
said
she
has
earned
it
sir
james
nodded
dreamily
and
turned
to
the
boat
to
the
london
bridge
stairs
first
he
said
there
was
a
kind
of
piquant
joy
in
their
hearts
as
they
crept
up
past
the
tower
and
saw
its
mighty
walls
and
guns
across
the
water
he
was
there
but
it
was
not
for
long
they
would
see
him
that
day
and
at
the
latest
they
would
all
leave
it
together
there
were
a
hundred
plans
in
the
old
man
mind
as
he
leaned
gently
forward
and
back
to
the
motion
of
the
boat
and
stared
at
the
bright
water
ralph
and
he
should
live
at
overfield
again
his
son
would
surely
be
changed
by
all
that
had
come
to
him
and
above
all
by
his
own
response
to
the
demands
of
loyalty
they
should
learn
to
understand
one
another
better
now
better
than
ever
before
the
hateful
life
lay
behind
them
of
distrust
and
contempt
ralph
would
come
back
to
his
old
self
and
be
again
as
he
had
been
ten
years
back
before
he
had
been
dazzled
and
drugged
by
the
man
who
was
to
die
next
day
then
he
thought
of
that
man
and
him
even
then
those
strong
walls
held
nothing
but
terror
for
him
terror
and
despair
the
scaffold
was
already
going
up
on
tower
hill
and
as
the
old
man
thought
of
it
he
leaned
forward
and
tried
to
see
over
the
wharf
and
under
the
trees
where
the
rising
ground
lay
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
the
foliage
hid
it
chris
also
silent
beside
him
was
full
of
thoughts
he
would
go
abroad
now
he
knew
with
margaret
as
they
had
intended
the
king
order
was
the
last
sign
of
god
intention
for
him
he
would
place
margaret
with
her
own
sisters
at
bruges
and
then
himself
go
on
to
dom
anthony
and
take
up
the
life
again
he
knew
he
would
meet
some
of
his
old
brethren
in
religion
dom
anthony
had
written
to
say
that
three
or
four
had
already
joined
him
at
cluny
the
prior
he
knew
had
turned
his
back
for
ever
on
the
monastic
life
and
had
been
put
into
a
prebendal
stall
at
lincoln
and
meanwhile
he
would
have
the
joy
of
knowing
that
ralph
was
free
of
his
hateful
business
the
king
would
not
employ
him
again
he
would
live
at
home
now
and
rule
overfield
well
he
and
his
father
together
ah
and
what
if
beatrice
consented
to
rule
it
with
him
surely
now
he
turned
and
looked
at
his
father
as
he
thought
of
it
and
their
eyes
met
chris
leaned
a
little
closer
beatrice
he
said
what
if
she
the
old
man
nodded
tenderly
and
his
drawn
eyes
shone
in
his
face
oh
chris
i
was
thinking
that
then
nicholas
came
out
of
his
maze
ever
since
his
entrance
into
the
palace
except
when
he
had
flared
out
at
the
king
he
had
moved
and
stood
and
sat
in
a
solemn
bewilderment
the
effect
of
the
changed
atmosphere
had
been
to
paralyse
his
simple
and
sturdy
faculties
and
his
face
had
grown
unintelligent
during
the
process
more
than
once
chris
had
been
seized
with
internal
laughter
in
spite
of
the
tragedy
the
rustic
squire
was
so
strangely
incongruous
with
the
situation
but
he
awoke
now
god
bless
me
he
said
wonderingly
it
is
all
over
and
done
god
chris
gave
a
short
yelp
of
laughter
dear
nick
he
said
yes
god
bless
you
indeed
you
spoke
up
well
did
i
do
right
sir
said
the
other
to
sir
james
i
could
not
help
it
i
oh
nick
said
the
old
man
and
leaned
forward
and
put
his
hand
on
his
knee
nicholas
preened
himself
as
he
sat
there
he
would
tell
mary
how
he
had
bearded
his
majesty
and
what
a
diplomatist
was
her
husband
you
did
very
well
sir
put
in
herries
ironically
you
terrified
his
grace
i
think
chris
glanced
at
the
lawyer
but
nicholas
took
it
all
with
the
greatest
complacency
tilted
his
hilt
a
little
forward
smoothed
his
doublet
and
sat
smiling
and
they
reached
the
stairs
presently
and
put
herries
ashore
i
will
be
at
your
house
sir
he
said
when
you
go
to
take
ralph
out
of
prison
the
order
will
be
there
by
the
morning
i
make
no
doubt
he
bowed
and
smiled
and
moved
off
a
stiff
figure
deliberately
picking
its
way
up
the
oozy
steps
to
the
crowded
street
overhead
beatrice
face
was
at
the
window
as
they
came
up
the
tide
later
chris
stood
up
in
the
wherry
when
he
saw
it
and
waved
his
cap
furiously
and
the
face
disappeared
she
was
at
the
landing
stage
before
they
reached
it
a
slender
brilliant
figure
in
her
hood
and
mantle
with
her
aunt
beside
her
chris
stood
up
again
and
cried
between
his
hands
across
the
narrowing
space
that
all
was
well
and
her
face
was
radiant
as
the
boat
slipped
up
to
the
side
and
balanced
there
with
the
boatman
hand
on
the
stone
edging
it
is
all
well
said
chris
again
as
he
stood
by
her
a
moment
later
he
is
to
go
free
and
we
are
to
tell
him
he
dared
not
look
at
her
but
he
was
aware
that
she
stood
very
still
and
rigid
and
that
her
eyes
were
on
his
father
oh
mistress
beatrice
chris
began
to
understand
it
all
a
little
better
a
few
minutes
later
as
the
boat
was
once
again
on
its
way
downstream
he
and
nicholas
had
moved
to
the
bows
of
the
wherry
and
the
girl
and
the
old
man
sat
alone
in
the
stern
they
were
all
very
silent
at
first
chris
leaned
on
his
elbow
and
stared
out
at
the
sliding
banks
the
trees
on
this
side
and
that
the
great
houses
with
their
high
roofs
and
towers
behind
and
their
stone
steps
in
front
the
brilliant
glare
on
the
water
the
hundreds
of
boats
great
barges
flashing
jewels
from
their
dozen
blades
spidery
wherries
making
this
way
and
that
and
his
mind
was
busy
weaving
pictures
he
saw
it
all
now
there
had
been
that
in
beatrice
face
during
the
moment
he
had
looked
at
her
that
was
more
than
sympathy
in
the
shock
of
that
great
joy
the
veils
had
fallen
and
her
soul
had
looked
out
through
her
black
tearful
eyes
there
was
little
doubt
now
as
to
what
would
happen
it
was
not
for
their
sake
alone
or
for
ralph
that
she
had
looked
like
that
she
had
not
said
one
word
but
he
knew
what
was
unspoken
as
they
passed
under
london
bridge
he
turned
a
little
and
looked
across
the
boatmen
shoulder
at
the
two
as
they
sat
there
in
the
stern
and
what
he
saw
confirmed
him
the
old
man
had
flung
an
arm
along
the
back
of
the
seat
and
was
leaning
a
little
forward
talking
in
a
low
voice
his
face
showing
indeed
the
lines
and
wrinkles
that
had
deepened
more
than
ever
during
these
last
weeks
but
irradiated
with
an
extraordinary
joy
and
the
girl
was
beside
him
smiling
with
downcast
eyes
turning
a
quick
look
now
and
again
as
she
sat
there
chris
could
see
her
scarlet
lips
trembling
and
her
hands
clasped
on
her
knee
shifting
a
little
now
and
again
as
she
listened
it
was
a
strange
wooing
the
father
courting
for
the
son
and
the
woman
answering
the
son
through
the
father
and
chris
understood
what
was
the
answer
that
she
was
giving
nicholas
was
watching
it
too
and
presently
the
two
in
the
stern
looked
up
suddenly
first
beatrice
and
then
sir
james
and
their
eyes
flashed
joy
across
and
across
as
the
four
souls
met
five
minutes
later
again
they
were
at
the
tower
stairs
morris
who
had
been
sent
on
by
mistress
jane
atherton
when
she
had
heard
the
news
was
there
holding
his
horse
by
the
bridle
and
behind
him
had
collected
a
little
crowd
of
idlers
he
gave
the
bridle
to
one
of
them
and
came
down
the
steps
to
help
them
out
of
the
boat
you
have
heard
said
chris
as
he
stepped
out
last
yes
father
said
the
servant
chris
looked
at
him
and
his
face
too
seemed
strangely
lighted
up
there
was
still
across
his
cheek
the
shadow
of
a
mark
as
of
an
old
as
they
passed
up
the
steps
they
became
aware
that
the
little
crowd
that
had
waited
at
the
top
was
only
the
detached
fringe
of
a
multitude
that
had
assembled
further
up
the
slope
it
stretched
under
the
trees
as
far
as
they
could
see
to
right
and
left
from
the
outer
wall
of
the
tower
on
the
one
side
to
where
the
rising
ground
on
the
left
was
hidden
under
the
thick
foliage
in
the
foreground
there
was
a
murmur
of
talking
and
laughter
the
ringing
of
the
cracking
of
whips
and
the
cries
of
children
the
backs
of
the
crowd
were
turned
to
the
steps
there
was
plainly
something
going
on
higher
up
the
slope
and
it
seemed
somewhat
away
to
the
left
for
a
moment
chris
did
not
understand
and
he
turned
to
morris
what
is
it
he
asked
the
scaffold
said
the
servant
tersely
at
the
same
moment
high
above
the
murmur
of
the
crowd
came
the
sound
of
heavy
resounding
blows
as
of
wood
on
wood
then
chris
remembered
and
for
one
moment
he
sickened
as
he
walked
his
father
turned
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
as
he
went
with
beatrice
in
front
and
his
eyes
were
eloquent
i
had
forgotten
said
chris
softly
god
help
him
they
turned
in
towards
the
right
almost
immediately
to
the
low
outer
gate
of
the
fortress
and
those
for
the
first
time
remembered
that
the
order
they
carried
was
for
four
only
nicholas
instantly
offered
to
wait
outside
and
let
morris
go
in
morris
flatly
refused
there
was
a
short
consultation
and
then
nicholas
went
up
to
the
sentry
on
guard
with
the
order
in
his
hand
the
man
looked
at
it
glanced
at
the
party
and
then
turned
and
knocked
with
his
halberd
on
the
great
door
behind
and
in
a
minute
or
two
an
officer
came
out
in
his
buff
and
feathers
he
took
the
order
and
ran
his
eyes
over
it
nicholas
explained
the
officer
looked
at
him
a
moment
without
answering
and
the
lady
too
he
said
why
yes
said
nicholas
the
lady
wishes
then
he
broke
off
you
will
have
to
see
the
lieutenant
he
went
on
i
can
let
you
all
through
to
his
lodgings
they
passed
in
with
a
yeoman
to
conduct
them
under
the
low
heavy
vaulting
and
through
to
the
open
way
beyond
on
their
right
was
the
wall
between
them
and
the
river
and
on
their
left
the
enormous
towers
and
battlements
of
the
inner
court
chris
walked
with
morris
behind
remembering
the
last
time
he
was
here
with
the
prior
all
those
years
before
they
had
walked
silently
then
too
but
for
another
reason
they
passed
the
low
traitor
gate
on
their
right
chris
glanced
at
the
green
lapping
water
beneath
it
as
he
went
ralph
had
landed
there
and
turned
up
the
steep
slope
to
the
left
under
the
gateway
of
the
inner
court
and
in
a
minute
or
two
more
were
at
the
door
of
the
lodgings
there
seemed
a
strange
suggestiveness
in
the
silence
and
order
of
the
wide
ward
that
lay
before
them
the
great
white
tower
dominated
the
whole
place
on
the
further
side
huge
and
menacing
pierced
by
its
narrow
windows
set
at
wide
intervals
on
the
left
the
row
of
towers
used
as
prisons
diminished
in
perspective
down
to
where
the
wall
turned
at
right
angles
and
ran
in
behind
the
keep
and
the
great
space
enclosed
by
the
whole
was
almost
empty
there
were
soldiers
on
guard
here
and
there
at
the
doorways
a
servant
hurried
across
the
wide
sunlit
ground
and
once
as
they
waited
a
doctor
in
his
short
gown
came
out
of
one
door
and
disappeared
into
another
and
here
they
waited
for
an
answer
to
their
summons
silent
and
happy
in
their
knowledge
the
place
held
no
terrors
for
them
the
soldier
knocked
again
impatiently
and
again
stood
aside
chris
saw
nicholas
sidle
up
to
the
man
with
something
of
the
same
awe
on
his
face
that
had
been
there
an
hour
ago
my
lord
master
cromwell
he
heard
him
whisper
correcting
himself
the
man
jerked
a
thumb
over
his
shoulder
there
he
said
there
were
three
soldiers
chris
noticed
standing
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
towers
a
little
distance
off
it
was
there
then
that
thomas
cromwell
waited
for
death
hearing
perhaps
from
his
window
the
murmur
of
the
crowd
beyond
the
moat
and
the
blows
of
mallet
on
wood
as
his
scaffold
went
up
then
the
door
opened
and
after
a
word
or
two
the
soldier
motioned
them
in
again
they
had
to
wait
the
lieutenant
they
were
told
had
been
called
away
he
was
expected
back
presently
they
sat
down
still
in
silence
in
the
little
parlour
it
was
a
pleasant
little
room
with
a
wide
hearth
and
two
windows
looking
on
to
the
court
but
the
suspense
was
not
like
that
of
the
morning
now
they
knew
how
it
must
end
there
would
be
a
few
minutes
more
long
perhaps
to
ralph
as
he
sat
in
his
cell
somewhere
not
far
from
them
knowing
nothing
of
the
pardon
that
was
on
its
way
and
then
the
door
would
open
where
day
by
day
for
the
last
six
weeks
the
gaoler
had
come
and
gone
and
the
faces
he
knew
would
be
there
and
it
would
be
from
their
lips
that
he
would
hear
the
message
the
old
man
and
the
girl
still
sat
together
in
the
silent
now
like
the
others
they
had
had
their
explanations
in
the
boat
and
each
knew
what
was
in
the
other
heart
chris
and
nicholas
stood
by
the
hearth
morris
by
the
door
and
there
was
not
the
tremor
of
a
doubt
in
any
of
them
as
to
what
the
future
held
chris
looked
tranquilly
round
the
room
at
the
little
square
table
in
the
centre
the
four
chairs
drawn
close
to
it
with
their
brocade
panels
stained
and
showing
at
the
back
the
dark
ceiling
the
piece
of
tapestry
that
hung
over
the
between
the
doors
it
was
a
martial
scene
faded
and
discoloured
with
ghostly
knights
on
fat
prancing
horses
all
in
inextricable
conflict
a
great
battleaxe
stood
out
against
the
dusky
foliage
of
an
autumn
tree
and
a
stag
with
his
fore
feet
in
the
air
ramped
in
the
foreground
looking
over
his
shoulder
it
was
a
ludicrously
bad
piece
of
work
picked
up
no
doubt
by
some
former
lieutenant
who
knew
more
of
military
than
artistic
matters
and
had
hung
there
how
long
chris
wondered
he
found
himself
criticising
it
detail
by
detail
comparing
it
with
his
own
designs
in
the
antiphonary
he
had
that
antiphonary
still
at
home
he
had
carried
it
off
from
lewes
when
ralph
ralph
had
turned
him
out
he
had
put
it
up
into
a
parcel
on
the
afternoon
of
the
arrival
he
would
show
it
to
ralph
again
now
in
a
day
or
two
at
overfield
they
would
laugh
over
it
together
and
he
would
take
it
with
him
abroad
and
perhaps
finish
it
there
god
work
is
not
so
easily
hindered
after
all
but
all
the
while
the
wandering
stream
of
his
thought
was
lighted
and
penetrated
by
the
radiant
joy
of
his
heart
it
was
all
true
not
a
dream
he
glanced
again
at
the
two
in
the
his
father
was
looking
out
of
the
lattice
but
beatrice
raised
her
eyes
to
his
and
smiled
at
him
sir
james
stood
up
the
lieutenant
is
coming
he
said
a
moment
later
there
were
steps
in
the
flagged
passage
and
a
murmur
of
voices
the
soldier
who
had
brought
them
to
the
lodgings
was
waiting
there
with
the
order
of
admission
and
was
no
doubt
explaining
the
circumstances
then
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
a
tall
man
and
in
an
officer
dress
stood
there
with
the
order
in
his
hand
as
the
two
in
the
rose
to
meet
him
master
torridon
he
said
abruptly
sir
james
stepped
forward
yes
sir
you
have
come
to
see
ralph
torridon
whom
we
have
here
yes
sir
my
son
nicholas
stepped
forward
and
the
lieutenant
nodded
at
him
yes
sir
said
the
officer
to
him
i
could
not
admit
you
before
he
stopped
as
if
embarrassed
and
turned
to
beatrice
and
this
lady
too
yes
master
lieutenant
said
the
old
man
but
but
i
do
not
understand
he
looked
at
the
radiant
faces
before
him
and
then
dropped
his
eyes
i
suppose
you
have
not
heard
then
chris
felt
his
heart
leap
and
then
begin
to
throb
furiously
and
insistently
what
had
happened
why
did
the
man
look
like
that
why
did
he
not
speak
the
lieutenant
came
a
step
forward
and
put
his
hand
on
the
table
he
was
looking
strangely
from
face
to
face
outside
the
court
was
very
still
the
footstep
that
had
passed
on
the
flagstones
a
minute
before
had
ceased
and
there
was
no
sound
but
the
chirp
of
a
bird
under
the
eaves
you
have
not
heard
then
said
the
lieutenant
again
oh
for
god
sake
cried
the
old
man
suddenly
i
have
just
come
from
your
son
said
the
other
steadily
you
are
only
just
in
time
he
is
at
the
point
of
death
chapter

the
release
it
was
morning
and
they
still
sat
in
ralph
cell
the
attendant
had
brought
in
stools
and
a
tall
chair
with
a
broken
back
and
these
were
grouped
round
the
low
wooden
bed
the
old
man
in
the
chair
on
one
side
from
where
he
could
look
down
on
his
son
face
with
beatrice
beside
him
chris
and
nicholas
on
the
other
side
morris
was
everywhere
sitting
on
a
form
by
the
door
in
and
out
with
food
and
medicine
at
his
old
master
bedside
lifting
his
pillow
turning
him
in
bed
holding
his
convulsive
hands
he
had
been
ill
six
days
the
lieutenant
told
them
the
doctor
who
had
been
called
in
from
outside
named
the
disease
it
was
certain
that
he
would
not
recover
and
a
message
to
that
effect
had
been
sent
across
on
the
morning
before
with
the
usual
reports
to
greenwich
they
had
supped
as
they
sat
silently
on
what
the
gaoler
brought
and
had
slept
by
turns
in
the
tall
chair
wakening
at
a
sound
from
the
bed
at
the
movement
of
the
light
across
the
floor
as
morris
slipped
to
and
fro
noiselessly
at
the
chirp
of
the
birds
and
the
noises
of
the
stirring
city
as
the
daylight
broadened
on
the
wall
and
the
narrow
window
grew
bright
and
luminous
and
now
the
morning
was
high
and
they
were
waiting
for
the
end
a
little
table
stood
by
the
door
with
two
candles
guttering
now
in
their
sockets
and
a
tall
crucifix
ivory
and
black
lifting
its
arms
in
the
midst
before
it
stood
two
veiled
vessels
he
will
speak
before
he
passes
the
doctor
had
told
them
the
evening
before
i
do
not
know
whether
he
will
be
able
to
receive
viaticum
chris
raised
himself
a
little
in
his
chair
he
was
stiff
with
leaning
elbows
on
knees
and
he
stretched
out
his
feet
softly
looking
down
still
at
the
bed
his
brother
lay
with
his
back
to
him
the
priest
could
see
the
black
hair
longer
than
court
fashion
allowed
now
the
brown
sinewy
neck
beneath
and
one
arm
outlined
over
his
hip
beneath
the
piled
clothes
the
fingers
were
moving
a
little
contracting
and
loosening
contracting
and
loosening
and
he
could
hear
the
long
slow
breaths
beyond
sat
beatrice
upright
and
quiet
one
hand
in
her
lap
and
the
other
holding
the
father
the
old
man
was
bowed
with
his
head
on
his
other
hand
as
he
had
been
for
the
last
hour
his
back
bent
forward
with
the
burden
and
his
feet
crossed
before
him
from
outside
the
noises
grew
louder
as
the
morning
advanced
there
had
been
the
sound
of
continual
coming
and
going
since
it
was
light
wheels
had
groaned
and
rattled
up
out
of
the
distance
and
ceased
abruptly
and
the
noise
of
hoofs
had
been
like
an
endless
patter
over
the
and
now
as
the
hours
passed
a
murmur
had
been
increasing
a
strange
sound
like
the
wind
in
dry
trees
as
the
huge
crowd
gathered
beatrice
raised
her
eyes
suddenly
the
fortress
itself
which
had
been
quiet
till
now
seemed
to
awaken
abruptly
the
sound
seemed
to
come
to
them
up
the
stairs
but
they
had
learnt
during
those
hours
that
all
sounds
from
within
came
that
way
there
was
a
or
two
short
and
brazen
a
tramp
of
feet
for
a
moment
the
throb
of
drums
then
silence
again
then
the
noise
of
moving
footsteps
that
came
and
went
in
an
instant
and
as
the
sound
came
ralph
stirred
he
swayed
slowly
over
on
to
his
back
his
breath
came
in
little
groans
that
died
to
silence
again
as
he
subsided
and
his
arm
drew
out
and
lay
on
the
bedclothes
chris
could
see
his
face
now
in
sharp
profile
against
beatrice
dark
skirt
white
and
sharp
the
skin
was
tightly
stretched
over
the
nose
and
cheekbones
his
long
thin
lips
were
slightly
open
there
was
a
painful
frown
on
his
forehead
and
his
eyes
squinted
terribly
at
the
ceiling
a
contraction
seized
the
priest
throat
as
he
watched
the
face
was
at
once
so
august
and
so
pitiable
the
lips
began
to
move
again
as
they
had
moved
during
the
night
it
seemed
as
if
the
dying
man
were
talking
and
listening
the
eyelids
twitched
a
little
and
once
he
made
a
movement
as
if
to
rise
up
chris
was
down
on
his
knees
in
a
moment
holding
him
tenderly
down
he
felt
the
thin
hands
come
up
and
fumble
with
his
own
and
noticed
lines
deepen
between
the
flickering
eyelids
then
the
hands
lay
quiet
chris
lifted
his
eyes
and
saw
his
father
face
and
beatrice
watching
something
of
the
augustness
of
the
dying
man
seemed
to
rest
on
the
grey
bearded
lips
and
solemn
eyes
that
looked
down
beatrice
face
was
steady
and
tender
and
as
the
priest
eyes
met
hers
she
nodded
yes
speak
to
him
she
said
chris
threw
a
hand
across
the
bed
and
rested
it
on
the
wooden
frame
and
then
lowered
himself
softly
till
his
mouth
was
at
the
other
ear
ralph
he
said
ralph
do
you
hear
me
then
he
raised
his
face
a
little
and
watched
the
eyelids
were
rising
slowly
but
they
dropped
again
and
there
came
a
little
faint
babbling
from
the
writhing
lips
but
no
words
were
intelligible
then
they
were
silent
he
hears
said
beatrice
softly
the
priest
bent
low
again
and
as
he
did
so
from
outside
came
a
strange
sound
as
of
a
long
monstrous
groan
from
a
thousand
throats
again
the
dying
man
stirred
his
hand
sought
his
brother
arm
and
gripped
it
with
a
kind
of
feeble
strength
then
dropped
again
on
to
the
coverlet
chris
hesitated
a
moment
and
again
glanced
up
and
as
he
did
so
there
was
a
sound
on
the
stairs
he
threw
himself
back
on
his
heels
and
looked
round
as
the
doctor
came
in
with
morris
behind
him
he
was
a
stout
ruddy
man
and
moved
heavily
across
the
floor
but
ralph
seemed
not
to
hear
it
the
doctor
came
to
the
end
of
the
bed
and
stood
staring
down
at
the
dying
man
face
frowning
and
pursing
his
lips
chris
watched
him
intently
for
some
sign
then
he
came
round
by
beatrice
leaned
over
the
bed
and
took
ralph
wrist
softly
into
his
fingers
he
suddenly
seemed
to
remember
himself
and
turned
his
face
abruptly
over
his
shoulder
to
sir
james
there
is
a
man
come
from
the
palace
he
whispered
harshly
i
suppose
it
is
the
pardon
and
chris
saw
him
arch
his
eyebrows
and
purse
his
lips
again
then
he
bent
over
ralph
once
more
then
again
the
doctor
jerked
his
head
towards
the
window
behind
and
spoke
across
to
chris
they
have
him
out
there
he
said
master
cromwell
i
mean
then
he
rose
abruptly
he
can
not
receive
viaticum
and
he
will
not
be
able
to
make
his
confession
i
should
shrive
him
at
once
sir
and
anoint
him
at
once
whispered
chris
the
sooner
the
better
said
the
doctor
there
is
no
telling
chris
rose
swiftly
from
his
knees
and
made
a
sharp
sign
to
morris
then
he
sank
down
once
more
looking
round
and
lifted
the
purple
stole
from
the
floor
where
he
had
laid
it
the
evening
before
and
even
as
he
did
so
his
soul
revolted
he
looked
up
at
beatrice
would
not
she
understand
the
unchivalry
of
the
act
but
the
will
in
her
eyes
compelled
yes
yes
who
could
set
a
limit
to
mercy
he
slipped
the
strip
over
his
shoulders
and
again
bent
down
over
his
brother
with
one
arm
across
the
motionless
body
beatrice
and
sir
james
were
on
their
knees
by
now
nicholas
was
busy
with
morris
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
the
doctor
was
gone
there
was
a
profound
silence
now
outside
as
the
priest
bent
lower
and
lower
till
his
lips
almost
touched
the
ear
of
the
dying
man
and
every
word
of
the
broken
abrupt
sentences
was
audible
to
all
in
the
room
ralph
ralph
dear
brother
you
are
at
the
point
of
death
i
must
shrive
you
you
have
sinned
very
deeply
against
god
and
man
i
shall
anoint
you
afterwards
make
an
act
of
sorrow
in
your
heart
for
all
your
sins
it
will
stand
for
confession
think
of
jesu
love
and
of
his
death
on
the
bitter
cross
the
wounds
that
he
bore
for
us
in
love
give
me
a
sign
if
you
can
that
you
repent
chris
spoke
rapidly
and
leaned
back
a
moment
now
he
was
terrified
of
waiting
he
did
not
know
how
long
it
would
be
but
for
an
intent
instant
he
stared
down
on
the
shadowed
face
again
the
eyelids
flickered
the
lips
formed
words
and
ceased
again
the
priest
glanced
up
scarcely
knowing
why
and
then
again
lowered
himself
that
if
it
were
possible
ralph
might
hear
then
he
spoke
with
a
tense
internal
effort
as
if
to
drive
the
grace
home
te
absolvo
ab
omnibus
censuris
et
peccatis
in
nomine
he
raised
himself
a
little
and
lifted
his
hand
moving
it
sideways
across
and
down
as
he
ended
filii
et
spiritus
the
priest
rose
up
once
more
his
duty
driving
his
emotion
down
he
did
not
dare
to
look
across
at
the
two
figures
beyond
the
bed
or
even
to
question
himself
again
as
to
what
he
was
doing
the
two
men
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
were
waiting
now
they
had
lifted
the
candles
and
crucifix
off
the
table
and
set
them
on
the
bench
by
the
side
chris
went
swiftly
across
the
room
dropped
on
one
knee
rose
again
lifted
the
veiled
vessel
that
stood
in
the
centre
with
the
little
linen
cloth
beneath
and
set
it
all
down
on
the
bench
he
knelt
again
went
a
step
aside
back
to
the
table
lifted
the
other
vessel
and
signed
with
his
head
the
two
men
grasped
the
ends
of
the
table
and
carried
it
across
the
floor
to
the
end
of
the
bed
chris
followed
and
set
down
the
sacred
oils
upon
it
the
cross
and
one
candle
he
whispered
sharply
a
minute
later
he
was
standing
by
the
bed
once
more
he
began
reading
rapidly
off
the
book
that
beatrice
held
steadily
beneath
his
eyes
everlasting
god
who
through
blessed
james
thy
apostle
hast
spoken
saying
is
any
sick
among
you
let
him
call
the
priests
of
the
the
lips
of
the
dying
man
were
moving
again
at
the
sound
of
the
words
was
it
in
protest
or
in
faith
is
what
is
done
without
through
our
ministry
may
be
wrought
within
spiritually
by
thy
divine
power
and
invisibly
by
thy
healing
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
the
lips
were
moving
faster
than
ever
on
the
pillow
the
head
was
beginning
to
turn
from
side
to
side
and
the
mouth
lay
open
began
beatrice
chris
dipped
his
thumb
in
the
vessel
and
sank
swiftly
on
to
his
knees
istam
sanctam
this
holy
the
old
man
leaned
suddenly
forward
on
to
his
knees
and
steadied
that
rolling
head
in
his
two
hands
and
chris
signed
firmly
on
the
eyelids
pressing
them
down
and
feeling
the
fluttering
beneath
his
thumb
as
he
did
so
his
most
loving
mercy
may
the
lord
forgive
thee
whatsoever
thou
hast
sinned
through
ah
that
was
done
dear
god
those
eyes
that
had
drooped
and
sneered
that
had
looked
so
greedily
on
treasure
their
lids
shone
now
with
the
of
god
chris
snatched
a
morsel
of
wool
that
morris
put
forward
from
behind
wiped
the
eyelids
and
dropped
the
fragment
into
the
earthen
basin
at
his
side
istam
sanctam
and
the
ears
were
anointed
the
ears
that
had
listened
to
filth
to
cromwell
plotting
and
to
the
cries
of
the
oppressed
the
nostrils
the
lips
that
had
lied
and
stormed
and
accused
against
god
people
compressed
now
in
his
father
fingers
they
seemed
to
sneer
even
now
and
to
writhe
under
the
soft
oil
the
hands
that
had
been
laid
on
god
portion
that
had
torn
the
vessels
from
the
altar
and
the
cloth
of
gold
from
the
treasury
those
too
were
signed
now
and
lay
twitching
on
the
coverlet
the
bed
clothes
at
the
foot
of
the
wooden
framework
were
lifted
and
laid
back
as
chris
passed
round
to
the
end
and
the
long
feet
icy
cold
were
lying
exposed
side
by
side
istam
sanctam
unctionem
et
suam
piissimam
misericordiam
indulgeat
tibi
domimus
quidquid
peccasti
per
incessum
pedum
then
they
too
were
sealed
with
pardon
the
feet
that
had
been
so
swift
and
unwearied
in
the
war
with
god
that
had
trodden
the
sanctuary
in
his
despite
and
trampled
down
the
hearts
of
his
saints
they
too
were
signed
now
with
the
mark
of
redemption
and
lay
again
under
the
folded
coverlet
at
the
end
of
their
last
journey
a
convulsion
tore
at
the
priest
heart
then
suddenly
in
the
profound
silence
outside
there
broke
out
an
indescribable
clamour
drowning
in
an
instant
the
murmur
of
prayers
within
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
world
of
men
were
there
and
roaring
the
sound
poured
up
through
the
window
across
the
moat
the
boards
of
the
flooring
vibrated
with
the
sound
there
was
the
throb
of
drums
pulsating
through
the
yell
the
screams
of
women
the
barking
of
dogs
and
a
moment
later
like
some
devilish
benediction
the
bells
of
barking
church
pealed
out
mellow
and
jangling
in
an
exultation
of
blood
ralph
struggled
in
his
bed
his
hands
rose
clutching
at
his
throat
tearing
open
his
shirt
before
beatrice
fingers
could
reach
them
the
breath
came
swift
and
hoarse
through
his
open
teeth
and
his
eyelids
flickered
furiously
then
they
opened
and
his
face
grew
quiet
as
he
looked
out
across
the
room
my
my
lord
he
said
the
end
