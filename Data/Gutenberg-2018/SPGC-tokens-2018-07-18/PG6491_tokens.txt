new

chapter
i
the
history
of
the
circumstances
about
to
be
related
began
many
years
ago
or
so
it
seems
in
these
days
it
began
at
least
years
before
the
world
being
rocked
to
and
fro
revealed
in
the
pause
between
each
of
its
heavings
some
startling
suggestion
of
a
new
arrangement
of
its
kaleidoscopic
particles
and
then
immediately
a
and
another
and
another
until
all
belief
in
a
permanency
of
design
seemed
lost
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
waited
helplessly
gazing
at
changing
stars
and
colours
in
a
degree
of
mental
chaos
its
opening
incidents
may
be
dated
from
a
period
when
people
still
had
reason
to
believe
in
permanency
and
had
indeed
many
of
them
sometimes
through
ingenuousness
sometimes
through
stupidity
of
type
acquired
a
singular
confidence
in
the
importance
and
stability
of
their
possessions
desires
ambitions
and
forms
of
conviction
london
at
the
time
in
common
with
other
great
capitals
felt
itself
rather
final
though
priding
itself
on
being
much
more
fluid
and
adaptable
than
it
had
been
fifty
years
previously
in
speaking
of
itself
it
at
least
dealt
with
fixed
customs
and
conditions
and
established
facts
connected
with
them
which
gave
rise
to
brilliant
or
dull
witticisms
one
of
these
heard
not
infrequently
was
to
the
effect
that
in
london
one
might
live
under
an
umbrella
if
one
lived
under
it
in
the
right
neighbourhood
and
on
the
right
side
of
the
street
which
axiom
is
the
reason
that
a
certain
child
through
the
first
six
years
of
her
life
sat
on
certain
days
staring
out
of
a
window
in
a
small
dingy
room
on
the
top
floor
of
a
slice
of
a
house
on
a
narrow
but
highly
fashionable
london
street
and
looked
on
at
the
passing
of
motors
carriages
and
people
in
the
dull
afternoon
grayness
the
room
was
exalted
above
its
station
by
being
called
the
day
nursery
and
another
room
equally
dingy
and
uninviting
was
known
as
the
night
nursery
the
slice
of
a
house
was
inhabited
by
the
very
pretty
its
inordinate
rent
being
reluctantly
paid
by
her
apparently
with
the
assistance
of
those
ravens
who
are
expected
to
supply
the
truly
deserving
the
rent
was
inordinate
only
from
the
standpoint
of
one
regarding
it
soberly
in
connection
with
the
character
of
the
house
itself
which
was
a
gaudy
little
kennel
crowded
between
two
comparatively
stately
mansions
on
one
side
lived
an
inordinately
rich
south
african
millionaire
and
on
the
other
an
inordinately
exalted
person
of
title
which
facts
combined
to
form
sufficient
grounds
for
a
certain
inordinateness
of
rent
was
also
it
may
be
stated
of
the
fibre
which
must
live
on
the
right
side
of
the
street
or
dissolve
into
nothingness
since
as
nearly
nothingness
as
an
embodied
entity
can
achieve
had
nature
seemingly
created
her
at
the
outset
so
light
and
airy
was
the
fair
slim
physical
presentation
of
her
being
to
the
earthly
vision
and
so
almost
impalpably
diaphanous
the
texture
and
form
of
mind
and
character
to
be
observed
by
human
perception
that
among
such
friends
and
enemies
as
so
slight
a
thing
could
claim
she
was
prettily
known
as
feather
her
real
name
amabel
was
not
half
as
charming
and
whimsical
in
its
appropriateness
feather
she
adored
being
called
and
as
it
was
the
fashion
among
the
amazing
if
amusing
circle
in
which
she
spent
her
life
to
call
its
acquaintances
fantastic
pet
names
selected
from
among
the
world
of
birds
beasts
and
fishes
or
inanimate
objects
feather
she
floated
through
her
curious
existence
and
it
so
happened
that
she
was
the
mother
of
the
child
who
so
often
stared
out
of
the
window
of
the
dingy
and
comfortless
day
nursery
too
much
a
child
to
be
more
than
vaguely
conscious
in
a
chaotic
way
that
a
certain
feeling
which
at
times
raged
within
her
and
made
her
little
body
hot
and
restless
was
founded
on
something
like
actual
hate
for
a
special
man
who
had
certainly
taken
no
deliberate
steps
to
cause
her
detestation
feather
had
not
been
called
by
that
delicious
name
when
she
married
robert
who
was
a
beautiful
and
irresponsibly
rather
than
deliberately
bad
young
man
she
was
known
as
amabel
darrel
and
the
loveliest
girl
in
the
lovely
corner
of
the
island
of
jersey
where
her
father
a
country
doctor
had
begotten
a
large
family
of
lovely
creatures
and
brought
them
up
on
the
appallingly
inadequate
proceeds
of
his
totally
inadequate
practice
pretty
female
things
must
be
disposed
of
early
lest
their
market
value
decline
therefore
a
young
man
even
without
obvious
resources
represents
a
sail
in
the
offing
which
is
naturally
welcomed
as
possibly
belonging
to
a
bark
which
may
at
least
bear
away
a
burden
which
the
back
carrying
it
as
part
of
its
pack
will
willingly
shuffle
on
to
other
shoulders
it
is
all
very
well
for
a
man
with
six
lovely
daughters
to
regard
them
as
capital
if
he
has
money
or
position
or
generous
relations
or
if
he
has
energy
and
an
ingenious
unfatigued
mind
but
a
man
who
is
tired
and
neither
clever
nor
important
in
any
degree
and
who
has
reared
his
brood
in
one
of
the
channel
islands
with
a
faded
silly
unattractive
wife
as
his
only
aid
in
any
difficulty
is
wise
in
leaving
the
whole
hopeless
situation
to
chance
and
luck
sometimes
luck
comes
without
assistance
but
almost
invariably
it
does
not
feather
who
was
then
amabel
thought
robert
incredible
good
luck
he
only
drifted
into
her
summer
by
merest
chance
because
a
friend
yacht
in
which
he
was
wandering
about
came
in
for
supplies
a
girl
ariel
in
a
thin
white
frock
and
with
big
larkspur
blue
eyes
yearning
at
you
under
her
flapping
hat
as
she
answers
your
questions
about
the
best
road
to
somewhere
will
not
be
too
difficult
about
showing
the
way
herself
and
there
you
are
at
a
beginning
the
night
after
she
met
in
a
lane
whose
banks
were
thick
with
bluebells
amabel
and
her
sister
alice
huddled
close
together
in
bed
and
talked
almost
pantingly
in
whispers
over
the
possibilities
which
might
reveal
themselves
god
willing
through
a
further
acquaintance
with
they
were
eager
and
breathlessly
anxious
but
they
were
young
young
in
their
eagerness
and
amabel
was
full
of
delight
in
his
good
looks
he
is
so
handsome
alice
she
whispered
actually
hugging
her
not
with
affection
but
exultation
and
he
ca
be
more
than
or
seven
and
i
sure
he
liked
me
you
know
that
way
a
man
has
of
looking
at
you
one
sees
it
even
in
a
place
like
this
where
there
are
only
curates
and
things
he
has
brown
eyes
like
dark
bright
water
in
pools
oh
alice
if
he
should
alice
was
not
perhaps
as
enthusiastic
as
her
sister
amabel
had
seen
him
first
and
in
the
darrel
household
there
was
a
sort
of
unwritten
not
always
observed
code
flimsily
founded
on
first
come
first
served
just
at
the
outset
of
an
acquaintance
one
might
say
hands
off
as
it
were
but
not
for
long
it
does
matter
how
pretty
one
is
they
seldom
do
alice
grumbled
and
he
may
have
a
farthing
alice
whispered
amabel
almost
agonizingly
i
care
a
farthing
if
only
he
would
have
i
a
farthing
have
you
a
farthing
has
anyone
who
ever
comes
here
a
farthing
he
lives
in
london
he
take
me
away
to
live
even
in
a
back
street
in
london
would
be
heaven
and
one
must
as
soon
as
one
possibly
one
must
and
oh
with
another
hug
which
this
time
was
a
shudder
think
of
what
doris
harmer
had
to
do
think
of
his
thick
red
old
neck
and
his
horrid
fatness
and
the
way
he
breathed
through
his
nose
doris
said
that
at
first
it
used
to
make
her
ill
to
look
at
him
she
got
over
it
whispered
alice
she
almost
as
fat
as
he
is
now
and
she
loaded
with
pearls
and
things
i
should
have
to
over
anything
said
amabel
if
this
one
would
i
could
fall
in
love
with
him
in
a
minute
did
you
hear
what
father
said
alice
brought
out
the
words
rather
slowly
and
reluctantly
she
was
not
eager
on
the
whole
to
yield
up
a
detail
which
after
all
added
glow
to
possible
prospects
which
from
her
point
of
view
were
already
irritatingly
glowing
yet
she
could
not
resist
the
impulse
of
excitement
no
you
hear
you
were
out
of
the
room
what
about
something
about
him
i
hope
it
was
horrid
how
could
it
be
he
said
alice
drawled
with
a
touch
of
girlishly
spiteful
indifference
that
if
he
was
one
of
the
poor
he
had
much
chance
of
succeeding
to
the
title
his
uncle
lord
lawdor
is
only
and
he
has
four
splendid
healthy
boys
perfect
little
giants
oh
i
did
know
there
was
a
title
how
splendid
exclaimed
amabel
rapturously
then
after
a
few
moments
innocent
maiden
reflection
she
breathed
with
sweet
hopefulness
from
under
the
sheet
children
so
often
have
scarlet
fever
or
diphtheria
and
you
know
they
say
those
very
strong
ones
are
more
likely
to
die
than
the
other
kind
the
vicar
of
sheen
lost
four
all
in
a
week
and
the
vicar
died
too
the
doctor
said
the
diphtheria
would
have
killed
him
if
the
shock
had
helped
alice
who
had
a
teaspoonful
more
brain
than
her
sister
burst
into
a
fit
of
giggling
it
was
necessary
to
smother
by
stuffing
the
sheet
in
her
mouth
oh
amabel
she
gurgled
you
are
such
a
donkey
you
would
have
been
silly
enough
to
say
that
even
if
people
could
have
heard
you
suppose
he
had
why
should
he
care
said
amabel
simply
one
ca
help
thinking
things
if
it
happened
he
would
be
the
earl
of
lawdor
and
she
fell
again
into
sweet
reflection
while
alice
giggled
a
little
more
then
she
herself
stopped
and
thought
also
after
all
perhaps
one
had
to
be
practical
the
tenor
of
her
thoughts
was
such
that
she
did
not
giggle
again
when
amabel
broke
the
silence
by
whispering
with
tremulous
soft
devoutness
alice
do
you
think
that
praying
really
helps
i
prayed
for
things
but
i
never
got
them
answered
alice
but
you
know
what
the
vicar
said
on
sunday
in
sermon
about
and
ye
shall
receive
perhaps
you
have
prayed
in
the
right
spirit
amabel
suggested
with
true
piety
shall
we
shall
we
try
let
us
get
out
of
bed
and
kneel
down
get
out
of
bed
and
kneel
down
yourself
was
alice
sympathetic
rejoinder
you
would
take
that
much
trouble
for
me
amabel
sat
up
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
in
the
faint
moonlight
and
her
white
she
was
almost
angelic
she
held
the
end
of
the
long
fair
soft
plait
hanging
over
her
shoulder
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
reproach
i
think
you
ought
to
take
some
interest
she
said
plaintively
you
know
there
would
be
more
chances
for
you
and
the
others
if
i
were
not
here
i
wait
until
you
are
not
here
replied
the
unstirred
alice
but
amabel
felt
there
was
no
time
for
waiting
in
this
particular
case
a
yacht
which
came
in
might
so
soon
put
out
she
knelt
down
clasping
her
slim
young
hands
and
bending
her
forehead
upon
them
in
effect
she
implored
that
divine
wisdom
might
guide
robert
in
the
much
desired
path
she
also
made
divers
promises
because
nothing
is
so
easy
as
to
promise
things
she
ended
with
a
gently
fervent
appeal
that
if
her
prayer
were
granted
something
might
happen
which
would
result
in
her
becoming
a
countess
of
lawdor
one
could
not
have
put
the
request
with
greater
tentative
delicacy
she
felt
quite
uplifted
and
a
trifle
saintly
when
she
rose
from
her
knees
alice
had
actually
fallen
asleep
already
and
she
sighed
quite
tenderly
as
she
slipped
into
the
place
beside
her
almost
as
her
lovely
little
head
touched
the
pillow
her
own
eyes
closed
then
she
was
asleep
herself
and
in
the
faintly
moonlit
room
with
the
long
soft
plait
trailing
over
her
shoulder
looked
even
more
like
an
angel
than
before
whether
or
not
as
a
result
of
this
touching
appeal
to
the
throne
of
grace
robert
did
in
three
months
there
was
a
wedding
at
the
very
ancient
village
church
and
the
flowerlike
bridesmaids
followed
a
flower
of
a
bride
to
the
altar
and
later
in
the
day
to
the
station
from
where
and
robert
went
on
their
way
to
london
perhaps
alice
and
olive
also
knelt
by
the
side
of
their
white
beds
the
night
after
the
wedding
for
on
that
propitious
day
two
friends
of
the
bridegroom
one
of
them
the
owner
of
the
yacht
decided
to
return
again
to
the
place
where
there
were
to
be
found
the
most
nymphlike
of
pretty
creatures
a
man
had
ever
by
any
chance
beheld
such
delicate
little
fair
crowned
heads
such
delicious
little
noses
and
slim
white
throats
such
ripples
of
gay
chatter
and
nonsense
when
a
man
has
fortune
enough
of
his
own
why
not
take
the
prettiest
thing
he
sees
so
alice
and
olive
were
borne
away
also
and
poor
and
darrel
breathed
sighs
of
relief
and
there
were
not
only
more
chances
but
causes
for
bright
hopefulness
in
the
once
crowded
house
which
now
had
rooms
to
spare
a
certain
inattention
on
the
part
of
the
deity
was
no
doubt
responsible
for
the
fact
that
something
did
not
happen
to
the
family
of
lord
lawdor
on
the
contrary
his
four
little
giants
of
sons
throve
astonishingly
and
a
few
months
after
the
wedding
lady
lawdor
a
trifle
effusively
as
it
were
presented
her
husband
with
twin
male
infants
so
robust
that
they
were
humorously
known
for
years
afterwards
as
the
twin
herculeses
by
that
time
amabel
had
become
feather
and
despite
ingenious
and
carefully
detailed
method
of
living
upon
nothing
whatever
had
many
reasons
for
knowing
that
life
is
a
back
street
in
london
is
not
a
matter
of
beds
of
roses
since
the
back
street
must
be
the
right
street
and
its
accompaniments
must
wear
an
aspect
of
at
least
seeming
to
belong
to
the
right
order
of
detachment
and
fashionable
ease
one
was
always
in
debt
and
forced
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
duns
and
obliged
to
pretend
things
and
tell
lies
with
aptness
and
outward
gaiety
sometimes
one
actually
was
so
far
driven
to
the
wall
that
one
could
not
keep
most
important
engagements
and
the
invention
of
plausible
excuses
demanded
absolute
genius
the
slice
of
a
house
between
the
two
big
ones
was
a
rash
feature
of
the
honeymoon
but
a
year
of
giving
smart
little
dinners
in
it
and
going
to
smart
big
dinners
from
it
in
a
smart
if
small
brougham
ended
in
a
condition
somewhat
akin
to
the
feat
of
balancing
oneself
on
the
edge
of
a
sword
then
robin
was
born
she
was
an
intruder
and
a
calamity
of
course
nobody
had
contemplated
her
for
a
moment
feather
cried
for
a
week
when
she
first
announced
the
probability
of
her
advent
afterwards
however
she
managed
to
forget
the
approaching
annoyance
and
went
to
parties
and
danced
to
the
last
hour
continuing
to
be
a
great
success
because
her
prettiness
was
delicious
and
her
diaphanous
mentality
was
no
strain
upon
the
minds
of
her
admirers
male
and
female
that
a
feather
should
become
a
parent
gave
rise
to
much
wit
of
light
weight
when
robin
in
the
form
of
a
bundle
of
lace
was
carried
down
by
her
nurse
to
be
exhibited
in
the
gaudy
crowded
little
in
the
slice
of
a
house
in
the
mayfair
street
it
was
the
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
who
asked
the
first
question
about
her
what
will
you
do
with
her
he
inquired
detachedly
the
frequently
referred
to
babe
unborn
could
not
have
presented
a
gaze
of
purer
innocence
than
did
the
lovely
feather
her
eyes
of
larkspur
blueness
were
clear
of
any
thought
or
intention
as
spring
water
is
clear
at
its
unclouded
best
her
ripple
of
a
laugh
was
clear
also
enchantingly
clear
do
repeated
what
is
it
people
with
babies
i
suppose
the
nurse
knows
i
do
i
would
touch
her
for
the
world
she
frightens
me
she
floated
a
trifle
nearer
and
bent
to
look
at
her
i
shall
call
her
robin
she
said
her
name
is
really
roberta
as
she
could
be
called
robert
people
will
turn
round
to
look
at
a
girl
when
they
hear
her
called
robin
besides
she
has
eyes
like
a
robin
i
wish
she
open
them
and
let
you
see
by
chance
she
did
open
them
at
the
moment
quite
slowly
they
were
dark
liquid
brown
and
seemed
to
be
all
lustrous
iris
which
gazed
unmovingly
at
the
object
in
of
focus
that
object
was
the
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
she
is
staring
at
me
there
is
antipathy
in
her
gaze
he
said
and
stared
back
unmovingly
also
but
with
a
sort
of
cold
interest
chapter
ii
the
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
was
not
a
title
to
be
found
in
burke
or
debrett
it
was
a
fine
irony
of
the
head
own
and
having
been
accepted
by
his
acquaintances
was
not
infrequently
used
by
them
in
their
light
moments
in
the
same
spirit
the
peerage
recorded
him
as
a
marquis
and
added
several
lesser
attendant
titles
when
english
society
was
respectable
even
to
stodginess
at
times
was
his
point
of
view
to
be
born
head
of
the
house
was
a
weighty
and
thing
in
fearful
private
denunciatory
interviews
with
one
parents
and
governors
it
was
brought
up
against
one
as
a
final
argument
against
immoral
conduct
such
as
debt
and
not
going
to
church
as
the
head
of
the
house
one
was
called
upon
to
be
an
example
in
the
country
one
appeared
in
one
pew
and
announced
oneself
a
sinner
in
loud
tones
one
had
to
invite
the
rector
to
dinner
with
regularity
and
ladies
of
one
family
gave
tea
and
flannel
petticoats
and
baby
clothes
to
cottagers
men
and
women
were
known
as
and
in
those
halcyon
days
one
represented
things
parties
in
parliament
benevolent
societies
and
british
hospitality
in
the
form
of
astounding
long
dinners
at
which
one
drank
healths
and
made
speeches
in
roseate
youth
one
danced
the
schottische
and
the
polka
and
the
round
waltz
which
lord
byron
denounced
as
indecent
to
recall
the
vigour
of
his
poem
gives
rise
to
a
smile
when
one
chances
to
sup
at
a
cabaret
he
was
considered
very
amusing
when
he
analyzed
his
own
mental
attitude
towards
his
world
in
general
i
was
born
somewhat
too
late
and
somewhat
too
early
he
explained
in
his
light
rather
cold
and
detached
way
i
was
born
and
educated
at
the
closing
of
one
era
and
have
to
adjust
myself
to
living
in
another
i
was
as
it
were
cradled
among
treasured
relics
of
the
ethics
of
the
georges
and
queen
charlotte
and
queen
victoria
in
her
bloom
was
in
my
bloom
in
the
days
when
were
reproved
for
wearing
dresses
cut
too
low
at
drawing
rooms
such
training
gives
curious
interest
to
fashions
in
which
bodices
are
unconsidered
trifles
and
greek
nymphs
who
dance
with
bare
feet
and
beautiful
bare
legs
may
be
one
own
relations
i
trust
i
do
not
seem
even
in
the
shadowiest
way
to
comment
unfavourably
i
merely
look
on
at
the
rapidities
of
change
with
unalloyed
interest
as
the
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
i
am
not
sure
what
i
am
an
example
of
or
to
which
is
why
i
at
times
regard
myself
in
that
capacity
with
a
slightly
ribald
lightness
the
detachment
of
his
question
with
regard
to
the
newborn
infant
of
the
airily
irresponsible
feather
was
in
entire
harmony
with
his
attitude
towards
the
singular
incident
of
life
as
illustrated
by
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
by
none
of
which
he
was
as
far
as
could
be
observed
either
impressed
disturbed
or
prejudiced
his
own
experience
had
been
richly
varied
and
practically
unlimited
in
its
opportunities
for
pleasure
sinful
or
unsinful
indulgence
mitigated
or
unmitigated
wickedness
the
gathering
of
strange
knowledge
and
the
possible
ignoring
of
all
dull
boundaries
this
being
the
case
a
superhuman
charity
alone
could
have
forborne
to
believe
that
his
opportunities
had
been
neglected
in
the
heyday
of
his
youth
wealth
and
lack
of
limitations
in
themselves
would
have
been
quite
enough
to
cause
the
nonconformist
victorian
mind
to
regard
a
young
or
male
as
likely
to
represent
a
fearsome
moral
example
but
these
three
temptations
combined
with
good
looks
and
a
certain
mental
brilliance
were
so
inevitably
the
concomitants
of
elegant
iniquity
that
the
results
might
be
taken
for
granted
that
the
various
worlds
in
which
he
lived
in
various
lands
accepted
him
joyfully
as
an
interesting
and
desirable
of
more
or
less
abominably
sinful
personage
the
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
even
many
years
before
he
became
its
head
regarded
with
the
detachment
which
he
had
even
much
earlier
begun
to
learn
why
should
it
be
in
the
least
matter
what
people
thought
of
one
why
should
it
in
the
least
matter
what
one
thought
of
oneself
and
therefore
why
should
one
think
at
all
he
had
begun
at
the
outset
a
brilliantly
happy
young
pagan
with
this
simple
theory
after
the
passing
of
some
years
he
had
not
been
quite
so
happy
but
had
remained
quite
as
pagan
and
retained
the
theory
which
had
lost
its
first
fine
careless
rapture
and
gained
a
secret
bitterness
he
had
not
married
and
innumerable
stories
were
related
to
explain
the
reason
why
they
were
most
of
them
quite
false
and
none
of
them
quite
true
when
he
ceased
to
be
a
young
man
his
delinquency
was
much
discussed
more
especially
when
his
father
died
and
he
took
his
place
as
the
head
of
his
family
he
was
old
enough
rich
enough
important
enough
for
marriage
to
be
almost
imperative
but
he
remained
unmarried
in
addition
he
seemed
to
consider
his
abstinence
entirely
an
affair
of
his
own
are
you
as
wicked
as
people
say
you
are
a
reckless
young
woman
once
asked
him
she
belonged
to
the
younger
set
which
was
that
season
trying
recklessness
in
a
tentative
way
as
a
new
fashion
i
really
do
know
it
is
so
difficult
to
decide
he
answered
i
could
tell
better
if
i
knew
exactly
what
wickedness
is
when
i
find
out
i
will
let
you
know
so
good
of
you
to
take
an
interest
thirty
years
earlier
he
knew
that
a
young
lady
who
had
heard
he
was
wicked
would
have
perished
in
flames
before
immodestly
mentioning
the
fact
to
him
but
might
have
delicately
attempted
to
offer
first
aid
to
reformation
by
approaching
with
sweetness
the
subject
of
going
to
church
the
reckless
young
woman
looked
at
him
with
an
attention
which
he
was
far
from
being
blind
enough
not
to
see
was
increased
by
his
answer
i
never
know
what
you
mean
she
said
almost
wistfully
neither
do
i
was
his
amiable
response
and
i
am
sure
it
would
not
be
worth
while
going
into
really
we
neither
of
us
know
what
we
mean
perhaps
i
am
as
wicked
as
i
know
how
to
be
and
i
may
have
painful
limitations
or
i
may
not
after
his
father
death
he
spent
rather
more
time
in
london
and
rather
less
in
wandering
over
the
face
of
the
globe
but
by
the
time
he
was
forty
he
knew
familiarly
far
countries
and
near
and
was
intimate
with
most
of
the
peoples
thereof
he
could
have
found
his
way
about
in
the
most
distinctive
parts
of
most
of
the
great
cities
he
had
seen
and
learned
many
things
the
most
absorbing
to
his
mind
had
been
the
ambitions
and
changes
of
nations
statesmen
rulers
and
those
they
ruled
or
were
ruled
by
courts
and
capitals
knew
him
and
his
opportunities
were
such
as
gave
him
all
ease
as
an
onlooker
he
was
outwardly
of
the
type
which
does
not
arouse
caution
in
talkers
and
he
heard
much
which
was
suggestive
even
to
illumination
from
those
to
whom
he
remained
unsuspected
of
being
a
man
who
remembered
things
long
and
was
astute
in
drawing
conclusions
the
fact
remained
however
that
he
possessed
a
remarkable
memory
and
one
which
was
not
a
filled
with
unassorted
and
remnants
but
a
large
and
orderly
space
whose
contents
were
catalogued
and
filed
and
well
enclosed
from
observation
he
was
also
given
to
the
mental
argument
which
follows
a
point
to
its
conclusion
as
a
mere
habit
of
mind
he
saw
and
knew
well
those
who
sat
and
pondered
with
knit
brows
and
cautiously
hovering
hand
at
the
great
which
is
formed
by
the
map
of
europe
he
found
an
enormous
interest
in
watching
their
play
it
was
his
fortune
as
a
result
of
his
position
to
know
persons
who
wore
crowns
and
a
natural
incident
in
whose
lives
it
was
to
receive
the
homage
expressed
by
the
uncovering
of
the
head
and
the
bending
of
the
knee
at
forty
he
looked
back
at
the
time
when
the
incongruousness
the
abnormality
and
the
unsteadiness
of
the
foundations
on
which
such
personages
stood
first
struck
him
the
realization
had
been
in
its
almost
sacrilegious
novelty
and
daring
a
sort
of
thunderbolt
passing
through
his
mind
he
had
at
the
time
spoken
of
it
only
to
one
person
i
have
no
moral
or
ethical
views
to
offer
he
had
said
i
only
see
the
thing
as
it
is
will
disintegrate
i
am
so
at
sea
as
to
what
will
take
its
place
that
i
feel
as
if
the
prospect
were
rather
horrible
one
has
had
the
old
landmarks
and
been
impressed
by
the
old
pomp
and
picturesqueness
so
many
centuries
that
one
can
not
see
the
earth
without
them
there
have
been
kings
even
in
the
cannibal
islands
as
a
statesman
or
a
diplomat
he
would
have
seen
far
but
he
had
been
too
much
occupied
with
life
as
an
entertainment
too
for
work
of
any
order
he
freely
admitted
to
himself
that
he
was
a
worthless
person
but
the
fact
did
not
disturb
him
having
been
born
with
a
certain
order
of
brain
it
observed
and
worked
in
spite
of
him
thereby
adding
flavour
and
interest
to
existence
but
that
was
all
it
can
not
be
said
that
as
the
years
passed
he
quite
enjoyed
the
fact
that
he
knew
he
was
rarely
spoken
of
to
a
stranger
without
its
being
mentioned
that
he
was
the
most
perfectly
dressed
man
in
london
he
rather
detested
the
idea
though
he
was
aware
that
the
truth
was
unimpeachable
the
perfection
of
his
accompaniments
had
arisen
in
his
youth
from
a
secret
feeling
for
fitness
and
harmony
texture
and
colour
gave
him
almost
abnormal
pleasure
his
expression
of
this
as
a
masculine
creature
had
its
limits
which
resulted
in
a
concentration
on
perfection
even
at
however
he
had
never
been
called
a
dandy
and
even
at
no
one
had
as
yet
hinted
at
beau
brummel
though
by
that
time
men
as
well
as
women
frequently
described
to
each
other
the
cut
and
colour
of
the
garments
he
wore
and
tailors
besought
him
to
honour
them
with
crumbs
of
his
patronage
in
the
ambitious
hope
that
they
might
mention
him
as
a
client
and
the
simple
fact
that
he
appeared
in
a
certain
colour
or
cut
set
it
at
once
on
its
way
to
become
a
fashion
to
be
seized
upon
worn
and
exaggerated
until
it
was
dropped
suddenly
by
its
originator
and
lost
in
the
oblivion
of
cheap
imitations
and
cheap
tailor
shops
the
first
exaggeration
of
the
harmony
he
had
created
and
the
original
was
seen
no
more
feather
herself
had
a
marvellous
trick
in
the
collecting
of
her
garments
it
was
a
trick
which
at
times
barely
escaped
assuming
the
proportions
of
absolute
creation
her
passion
for
expressed
itself
in
ingenious
combination
and
quite
startling
uniqueness
of
line
now
and
then
her
slim
fairness
and
gossamer
hair
carried
airily
strange
tilts
and
curves
of
little
or
large
hats
or
daring
tints
other
women
could
not
sustain
but
invariably
strove
to
imitate
however
disastrous
the
results
beneath
soft
drooping
or
oddly
flopping
brims
hopelessly
unbecoming
to
most
faces
hers
looked
out
quaintly
lovely
as
a
pictured
wearing
its
grandmother
bonnet
everything
draped
itself
about
or
clung
to
her
in
entrancing
folds
which
however
whimsical
were
never
grotesque
things
are
always
becoming
to
me
she
said
quite
simply
but
often
i
stick
a
few
pins
into
a
dress
to
tuck
it
up
here
and
there
or
if
i
give
a
hat
a
poke
somewhere
to
make
it
crooked
they
are
much
more
becoming
people
are
always
asking
me
how
i
do
it
but
i
do
know
how
i
bought
a
hat
from
cerise
last
week
and
i
gave
it
two
little
thumps
with
my
fist
one
in
the
crown
and
one
in
the
brim
and
they
made
it
wonderful
the
maid
of
the
most
grand
kind
of
person
tried
to
find
out
from
my
maid
where
i
bought
it
i
would
let
her
tell
of
course
she
created
fashions
and
was
imitated
as
was
the
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
but
she
was
enraptured
by
the
fact
and
the
entire
power
of
such
gray
matter
as
was
held
by
her
small
brain
cells
was
concentrated
upon
her
desire
to
evolve
new
fantasies
and
amazements
for
her
world
before
he
had
been
married
for
a
year
there
began
to
creep
into
the
mind
of
bob
a
fearsome
doubt
remotely
hinting
that
she
might
end
by
becoming
an
awful
bore
in
the
course
of
time
particularly
if
she
also
ended
by
being
less
pretty
she
chattered
so
incessantly
about
nothing
and
was
such
an
extravagant
little
fool
in
her
insistence
on
clothes
clothes
clothes
as
if
they
were
the
breath
of
life
after
watching
her
for
about
two
hours
one
morning
as
she
sat
before
her
mirror
directing
her
maid
to
arrange
and
her
hair
in
different
styles
in
delicate
puffs
and
curls
and
straying
rings
soft
bands
and
loops
in
braids
and
coils
he
broke
forth
into
an
uneasy
short
laugh
and
expressed
himself
though
she
did
not
know
he
was
expressing
himself
and
would
not
have
understood
him
if
she
had
if
you
have
a
soul
and
i
not
at
all
certain
you
have
he
said
it
divided
into
a
dressmaker
and
a
hairdresser
and
a
milliner
shop
it
full
of
tumbled
piles
of
hats
and
frocks
and
diamond
combs
it
an
awful
mess
feather
i
hope
it
a
shoe
shop
and
a
jeweller
as
well
she
laughed
quite
gaily
and
a
i
need
every
one
of
them
it
a
rag
shop
he
said
it
has
nothing
but
chiffons
in
it
if
ever
i
do
think
of
souls
i
think
of
them
as
silly
gauzy
things
floating
about
like
little
balloons
was
her
cheerful
response
that
an
idea
he
answered
with
a
rather
louder
laugh
yours
might
be
made
of
pink
and
blue
gauze
spangled
with
those
things
you
call
paillettes
the
fancy
attracted
her
if
i
had
one
like
that
with
a
pleased
creative
air
it
would
look
rather
ducky
floating
from
my
shoulder
or
even
my
hat
or
my
hair
in
the
evenings
just
held
by
a
tiny
sparkling
chain
fastened
with
a
diamond
pin
and
with
lovely
little
pink
and
blue
streamers
with
the
touch
of
genius
she
had
at
once
relegated
it
to
its
place
in
the
scheme
of
her
universe
and
robert
laughed
even
louder
than
before
you
must
make
me
laugh
she
said
holding
up
her
hand
i
am
having
my
hair
done
to
match
that
quakery
thin
pale
mousey
dress
with
the
tiny
poke
bonnet
and
i
want
to
try
my
face
too
i
must
look
sweet
and
demure
you
must
really
laugh
when
you
wear
a
dress
and
hat
like
that
you
must
only
smile
some
months
earlier
bob
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
believe
that
she
said
this
entirely
without
any
touch
of
humour
but
he
realized
now
that
it
was
so
said
he
had
some
sense
of
humour
of
his
own
and
one
of
his
reasons
for
vaguely
feeling
that
she
might
become
a
bore
was
that
she
had
none
whatever
it
was
at
the
garden
party
where
she
wore
the
thin
quakery
mousey
dress
and
tiny
poke
bonnet
that
the
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
first
saw
her
it
was
at
the
place
of
a
fashionable
artist
who
lived
at
hampstead
and
had
a
garden
and
a
few
fine
old
trees
it
had
been
feather
special
intention
to
strike
this
note
of
delicate
dim
colour
every
other
woman
was
blue
or
pink
or
yellow
or
white
or
flowered
and
she
in
her
filmy
coolness
of
unusual
hue
stood
out
exquisitely
among
them
other
heads
wore
hats
broad
or
curved
or
flopping
hers
looked
like
a
little
nun
or
an
imaginary
portrait
of
a
delicious
young
she
was
more
arresting
than
any
other
female
creature
on
the
emerald
sward
or
under
the
spreading
trees
when
coombe
eyes
first
fell
upon
her
he
was
talking
to
a
group
of
people
and
he
stopped
speaking
someone
standing
quite
near
him
said
afterwards
that
he
had
for
a
second
or
so
become
pale
almost
as
if
he
saw
something
which
frightened
him
who
is
that
under
the
copper
beech
being
talked
to
by
harlow
he
inquired
feather
was
in
fact
listening
with
a
gentle
air
and
with
her
eyelids
down
drooped
to
the
exact
line
harmonious
with
the
angelic
little
poke
bonnet
it
is
robert
we
call
her
he
was
answered
was
there
ever
anything
more
artful
than
that
startling
little
smoky
dress
if
it
was
flame
colour
one
would
see
it
as
quickly
one
would
look
at
it
as
long
said
coombe
one
is
in
danger
of
staring
and
the
little
hat
or
bonnet
which
pokes
and
is
fastened
under
her
pink
ear
by
a
satin
bow
held
by
a
loose
pale
bud
will
someone
rescue
me
from
staring
by
leading
me
to
her
it
wo
be
staring
if
i
am
talking
to
her
please
the
paleness
appeared
again
as
on
being
led
across
the
grass
he
drew
nearer
to
the
copper
beech
he
was
still
rather
pale
when
feather
lifted
her
eyes
to
him
her
eyes
were
so
shaped
by
nature
that
they
looked
like
an
angel
when
they
were
lifted
there
are
eyes
of
that
particular
cut
but
he
had
not
talked
to
her
fifteen
minutes
before
he
knew
that
there
was
no
real
reason
why
he
should
ever
again
lose
his
colour
at
the
sight
of
her
he
had
thought
at
first
there
was
with
the
perception
which
invariably
marked
her
sense
of
fitness
of
things
she
had
begun
in
the
course
of
the
fifteen
minutes
almost
before
the
colour
had
quite
returned
to
his
face
the
story
of
her
husband
idea
of
her
soul
as
a
balloon
of
pink
and
blue
gauze
spangled
with
paillettes
and
of
her
own
inspiration
of
wearing
it
floating
from
her
shoulder
or
her
hair
by
the
light
sparkling
chain
and
with
delicate
ribbon
streamers
she
was
much
delighted
with
his
laugh
though
she
thought
it
had
a
rather
cracked
harsh
sound
she
knew
he
was
an
important
person
and
she
always
felt
she
was
being
a
success
when
people
laughed
exquisite
he
said
i
shall
never
see
you
in
the
future
without
it
but
would
it
be
necessary
to
vary
the
colour
at
times
oh
yes
to
match
things
seriously
i
could
wear
a
pink
and
blue
one
with
this
glancing
over
the
smoky
mousey
thing
or
paillettes
oh
no
not
paillettes
he
agreed
almost
with
gravity
the
harsh
laugh
having
ended
one
could
imagine
the
exact
colour
in
a
moment
one
would
have
to
think
she
reflected
perhaps
a
misty
dim
bluey
thing
like
the
edge
of
a
scarcely
a
colour
at
all
for
an
instant
her
eyes
were
softly
shadowed
as
if
looking
into
a
dream
he
watched
her
fixedly
then
a
woman
who
was
a
sort
of
angel
might
look
like
that
when
she
was
asking
herself
how
much
her
pure
soul
might
dare
to
pray
for
then
he
laughed
again
and
feather
laughed
also
many
practical
thoughts
had
already
begun
to
follow
each
other
hastily
through
her
mind
it
would
be
the
best
possible
thing
for
them
if
he
really
admired
her
bob
was
having
all
sorts
of
trouble
with
people
they
owed
money
to
bills
were
sent
in
again
and
again
and
disagreeable
letters
were
written
her
dressmaker
and
milliner
had
given
her
most
rude
hints
which
could
indeed
be
scarcely
considered
hints
at
all
she
scarcely
dared
speak
to
their
smart
young
footman
who
she
knew
had
only
taken
the
place
in
the
slice
of
a
house
because
he
had
been
told
that
it
might
be
an
opening
to
better
things
she
did
not
know
the
exact
summing
up
at
the
agency
had
been
as
follows
they
a
good
looking
pair
and
he
lord
lawdor
nephew
they
bound
to
have
their
fling
and
smart
people
will
come
to
their
house
because
she
so
pretty
they
last
two
or
three
years
perhaps
and
you
open
the
door
to
the
kind
of
people
who
remember
a
well
young
fellow
if
he
shows
he
knows
his
work
above
the
usual
the
more
men
of
the
class
of
the
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
who
came
in
and
out
of
the
slice
of
a
house
the
more
likely
the
owners
of
it
were
to
get
good
invitations
and
continued
credit
feather
was
aware
besides
which
she
thought
ingenuously
if
he
was
rich
he
would
no
doubt
lend
bob
money
she
had
already
known
that
certain
men
who
liked
her
had
done
it
she
did
not
mind
it
at
all
one
was
obliged
to
have
money
this
was
the
beginning
of
an
acquaintance
which
gave
rise
to
much
argument
over
and
at
dinner
parties
and
in
boudoirs
even
in
corners
of
feather
own
gaudy
little
the
argument
regarded
the
degree
of
coombe
interest
in
her
there
was
always
curiosity
as
to
the
degree
of
his
interest
in
any
woman
especially
and
privately
on
the
part
of
the
woman
herself
casual
and
shallow
observers
said
he
was
quite
infatuated
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
to
a
man
of
his
temperament
the
more
concentrated
of
mind
said
it
was
not
possible
to
a
man
of
his
temperament
and
that
any
attraction
feather
might
have
for
him
was
of
a
kind
special
to
himself
and
that
he
alone
could
explain
it
and
he
would
not
remained
however
the
fact
that
he
managed
to
see
a
great
deal
of
her
it
might
be
said
that
he
even
rather
followed
her
about
and
more
than
one
among
the
specially
concentrated
of
mind
had
seen
him
on
occasion
stand
apart
a
little
and
look
at
her
watch
her
with
an
expression
suggesting
equally
profound
thought
and
the
profound
intention
to
betray
his
private
meditations
in
no
degree
there
was
no
shadow
of
profundity
of
thought
in
his
treatment
of
her
he
talked
to
her
as
she
best
liked
to
be
talked
to
about
herself
her
successes
and
her
clothes
which
were
more
successful
than
anything
else
he
went
to
the
little
but
exceedingly
lively
dinners
the
gave
and
though
he
was
understood
not
to
be
fond
of
dancing
now
and
then
danced
with
her
at
balls
feather
was
guilelessly
doubtless
concerning
him
she
was
quite
sure
that
he
was
in
love
with
her
her
idea
of
that
universal
emotion
was
that
it
was
a
matter
of
clothes
and
propinquity
and
loveliness
and
that
if
one
were
at
all
clever
one
got
things
one
wanted
as
a
result
of
it
her
overwhelming
affection
for
bob
and
his
for
her
had
given
her
life
in
london
and
its
entertaining
accompaniments
her
frankness
in
the
matter
of
this
desirable
capture
when
she
talked
to
her
husband
was
at
once
light
and
friendly
of
course
you
will
be
able
to
get
credit
at
his
tailor
as
you
know
him
so
well
she
said
when
i
persuaded
him
to
go
with
me
to
madame
helene
last
week
she
was
quite
amiable
he
helped
me
to
choose
six
dresses
and
i
believe
she
would
have
let
me
choose
six
more
does
she
think
he
is
going
to
pay
for
them
asked
bob
it
does
matter
what
she
thinks
feather
laughed
very
prettily
does
it
not
a
bit
i
shall
have
the
dresses
what
the
matter
rob
you
look
quite
red
and
cross
i
had
a
headache
for
three
days
he
answered
and
i
feel
hot
and
cross
i
do
care
about
a
lot
of
things
you
say
feather
do
be
silly
she
retorted
i
do
care
about
a
lot
of
things
you
say
and
do
too
for
the
matter
of
that
robert
who
was
sitting
on
a
chair
in
her
grunted
slightly
as
he
rubbed
his
red
and
flushed
forehead
there
a
sort
of
limit
he
commented
he
hesitated
a
little
before
he
added
sulkily
to
the
things
one
says
that
sounds
like
alice
was
her
undisturbed
answer
she
used
to
squabble
at
me
because
i
said
things
but
i
believe
one
of
the
reasons
people
like
me
is
because
i
make
them
laugh
by
saying
things
lord
coombe
laughs
he
is
a
very
good
person
to
know
she
added
practically
somehow
he
counts
do
you
recollect
how
before
we
knew
him
when
he
was
abroad
so
long
people
used
to
bring
him
into
their
talk
as
if
they
could
help
remembering
him
and
what
he
was
like
i
knew
quite
a
lot
about
him
about
his
cleverness
and
his
manners
and
his
way
of
keeping
women
off
without
being
rude
and
the
things
he
says
about
royalties
and
the
aristocracy
going
out
of
fashion
and
about
his
clothes
i
adore
his
clothes
and
i
convinced
he
adores
mine
she
had
in
fact
at
once
observed
his
clothes
as
he
had
crossed
the
grass
to
her
seat
under
the
copper
beech
she
had
seen
that
his
fine
thinness
was
inimitably
fitted
and
presented
itself
to
the
eye
as
that
final
note
of
perfect
line
which
ignores
any
possibility
of
comment
he
did
not
wear
things
they
were
expressions
of
his
mental
subtleties
feather
on
her
part
knew
that
she
wore
her
clothes
carried
them
about
with
her
however
beautifully
i
like
him
she
went
on
i
do
know
anything
about
political
parties
and
the
state
of
europe
so
i
do
understand
the
things
he
says
which
people
think
are
so
brilliant
but
i
like
him
he
is
really
as
old
as
i
thought
he
was
the
first
day
i
saw
him
he
had
a
haggard
look
about
his
mouth
and
eyes
then
he
looked
as
if
a
spangled
pink
and
blue
gauze
soul
with
little
floating
streamers
was
a
relief
to
him
the
child
robin
was
a
year
old
by
that
time
and
staggered
about
uncertainly
in
the
dingy
little
day
nursery
in
which
she
passed
her
existence
except
on
such
occasions
as
her
nurse
who
had
promptly
fallen
in
love
with
the
smart
young
footman
carried
her
down
to
the
kitchen
and
servants
hall
in
the
basement
where
there
was
an
earthy
smell
and
an
abundance
of
cockroaches
the
servants
hall
had
been
given
that
name
in
the
catalogue
of
the
fashionable
agents
who
let
the
home
and
it
was
as
cramped
and
grimy
as
the
two
nurseries
the
next
afternoon
robert
staggered
into
his
and
dropped
on
to
a
sofa
staring
at
her
and
breathing
hard
feather
he
gasped
do
know
what
up
with
me
i
believe
i
awfully
ill
i
ca
see
straight
ca
think
he
fell
over
sidewise
on
to
the
cushions
so
helplessly
that
feather
sprang
at
him
do
rob
do
she
cried
in
actual
anguish
lord
coombe
is
taking
us
to
the
opera
and
to
supper
afterwards
i
going
to
wear
she
stopped
speaking
to
shake
him
and
try
to
lift
his
head
oh
do
try
to
sit
up
she
begged
pathetically
just
try
give
up
till
afterwards
but
she
could
neither
make
him
sit
up
nor
make
him
hear
he
lay
back
heavily
with
his
mouth
open
breathing
stertorously
and
quite
insensible
it
happened
that
the
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
was
announced
at
that
very
moment
even
as
she
stood
wringing
her
hands
over
the
sofa
he
went
to
her
side
and
looked
at
have
you
sent
for
a
doctor
he
inquired
he
only
just
done
it
she
exclaimed
it
more
than
i
can
bear
you
said
the
prince
would
be
at
the
supper
after
the
opera
and
were
you
thinking
of
going
he
put
it
to
her
quietly
i
shall
have
to
send
for
a
nurse
of
course
she
began
he
went
so
far
as
to
interrupt
her
you
had
better
not
go
if
you
pardon
my
saying
so
he
suggested
not
go
not
go
at
all
she
wailed
not
go
at
all
was
his
answer
and
there
was
such
entire
lack
of
encouragement
in
it
that
feather
sat
down
and
burst
into
sobs
in
few
than
two
weeks
robert
was
dead
and
she
was
left
a
lovely
penniless
widow
with
a
child
chapter
iii
two
or
three
decades
earlier
the
prevailing
sentiment
would
have
been
that
poor
little
and
her
situation
were
pathetic
her
acquaintances
would
sympathetically
have
discussed
her
helplessness
and
absolute
lack
of
all
resource
so
very
pretty
so
young
the
mother
of
a
dear
little
girl
left
with
no
income
how
very
sad
what
could
she
do
the
elect
would
have
paid
her
visits
and
sitting
in
her
darkened
earnestly
besought
her
to
trust
to
her
maker
and
suggested
the
scriptures
as
suitable
reading
some
of
them
rare
and
strange
souls
even
in
their
time
would
have
known
what
they
meant
and
meant
what
they
said
in
a
way
they
had
as
yet
only
the
power
to
express
through
the
medium
of
a
certain
shibboleth
the
rest
would
have
used
the
same
forms
merely
because
shibboleth
is
easy
and
always
safe
and
creditable
but
to
feather
immediate
circle
a
multiplicity
of
engagements
fevers
of
eagerness
in
the
attainment
of
pleasures
and
ambitions
anxieties
small
and
large
terrors
and
a
whirl
of
days
left
no
time
for
the
regarding
of
pathetic
aspects
the
tiny
house
up
whose
staircase
tucked
against
a
wall
one
had
seemed
to
have
the
effect
of
crowding
even
when
one
went
alone
to
make
a
call
suddenly
ceased
to
represent
hilarious
little
parties
which
were
as
entertaining
as
they
were
up
to
date
and
noisy
the
most
daring
things
london
gossiped
about
had
been
said
and
done
and
worn
there
novel
social
ventures
had
been
tried
dancing
and
songs
which
seemed
almost
startling
at
first
but
which
were
gradually
being
generally
adopted
there
had
always
been
a
great
deal
of
laughing
and
talking
of
nonsense
and
the
bandying
of
jokes
and
catch
phrases
and
feather
fluttering
about
and
saying
delicious
silly
things
at
which
her
hearers
shouted
with
glee
such
a
place
could
not
suddenly
become
pathetic
it
seemed
almost
indecent
for
robert
to
have
dragged
death
nakedly
into
their
midst
to
have
died
in
his
bed
in
one
of
the
little
bedrooms
to
have
been
put
in
his
coffin
and
carried
down
the
stairs
scraping
the
wall
and
sent
away
in
a
hearse
nobody
could
bear
to
think
of
it
feather
could
bear
it
less
than
anybody
else
it
seemed
incredible
that
such
a
trick
could
have
been
played
her
she
shut
herself
up
in
her
stuffy
little
bedroom
with
its
shrimp
pink
frills
and
draperies
and
cried
lamentably
at
first
she
cried
as
a
child
might
who
was
suddenly
snatched
away
in
the
midst
of
a
party
then
she
began
to
cry
because
she
was
frightened
numbers
of
cards
with
sympathy
had
been
left
at
the
front
door
during
the
first
week
after
the
funeral
they
had
accumulated
in
a
pile
on
the
salver
but
very
few
people
had
really
come
to
see
her
and
while
she
knew
they
had
the
excuse
of
her
recent
bereavement
she
felt
that
it
made
the
house
ghastly
it
had
never
been
silent
and
empty
things
had
always
been
going
on
and
now
there
was
actually
not
a
sound
to
be
heard
no
one
going
up
and
down
stairs
rob
room
cleared
of
all
his
belongings
and
left
orderly
and
empty
the
like
a
gay
little
tomb
without
an
occupant
how
long
would
it
be
before
it
would
be
full
of
people
again
how
long
must
she
wait
before
she
could
decently
invite
anyone
it
was
really
at
this
point
that
fright
seized
upon
her
her
brain
was
not
given
to
activities
of
reasoning
and
followed
no
thought
far
she
had
not
begun
to
ask
herself
questions
as
to
ways
and
means
rob
had
been
winning
at
cards
and
had
borrowed
some
money
from
a
new
acquaintance
so
no
immediate
abyss
had
yawned
at
her
feet
but
when
the
thought
of
future
festivities
rose
before
her
a
sudden
check
made
her
involuntarily
clutch
at
her
throat
she
had
no
money
at
all
bills
were
piled
everywhere
perhaps
now
robert
was
dead
none
of
the
shops
would
give
her
credit
she
remembered
hearing
rob
come
into
the
house
swearing
only
the
day
before
he
was
taken
ill
and
it
had
been
because
he
had
met
on
the
a
collector
of
the
rent
which
was
long
and
must
be
paid
she
had
no
money
to
pay
it
none
to
pay
the
servants
wages
none
to
pay
the
household
bills
none
to
pay
for
the
monthly
hire
of
the
brougham
would
they
turn
her
into
the
street
would
the
servants
go
away
would
she
be
left
without
even
a
carriage
what
could
she
do
about
clothes
she
could
not
wear
anything
but
mourning
now
and
by
the
time
she
was
out
of
mourning
her
old
clothes
would
have
gone
out
of
fashion
the
morning
on
which
this
aspect
of
things
occurred
to
her
she
was
so
terrified
that
she
began
to
run
up
and
down
the
room
like
a
frightened
little
cat
seeing
no
escape
from
the
trap
it
is
caught
in
it
awful
it
awful
it
awful
broke
out
between
her
sobs
what
can
i
do
i
ca
do
anything
there
nothing
to
do
awful
it
awful
it
awful
she
ended
by
throwing
herself
on
the
bed
crying
until
she
was
exhausted
she
had
no
mental
resources
which
would
suggest
to
her
that
there
was
anything
but
crying
to
be
done
she
had
cried
very
little
in
her
life
previously
because
even
in
her
days
of
limitation
she
had
been
able
to
get
more
or
less
what
she
wanted
though
of
course
it
had
generally
been
less
and
crying
made
one
nose
and
eyes
red
on
this
occasion
she
actually
forgot
her
nose
and
eyes
and
cried
until
she
scarcely
knew
herself
when
she
got
up
and
looked
in
the
glass
she
rang
the
bell
for
her
maid
and
sat
down
to
wait
her
coming
tonson
should
bring
her
a
cup
of
beef
tea
it
time
for
lunch
she
thought
i
faint
with
crying
and
she
shall
bathe
my
eyes
with
it
was
not
tonson
custom
to
keep
her
mistress
waiting
but
today
she
was
not
prompt
feather
rang
a
second
time
and
an
impatient
third
and
then
sat
in
her
chair
and
waited
until
she
began
to
feel
as
she
felt
always
in
these
dreadful
days
the
dead
silence
of
the
house
it
was
the
thing
which
most
struck
terror
to
her
soul
that
horrid
stillness
the
servants
whose
place
was
in
the
basement
were
too
much
closed
in
their
gloomy
little
quarters
to
have
made
themselves
heard
upstairs
even
if
they
had
been
inclined
to
during
the
last
few
weeks
feather
had
even
found
herself
wishing
that
they
were
less
well
trained
and
would
make
a
little
noise
do
anything
to
break
the
silence
the
room
she
sat
in
rob
awful
little
room
adjoining
which
was
awful
because
of
what
she
had
seen
for
a
moment
lying
stiff
and
hard
on
the
bed
before
she
was
taken
away
in
hysterics
were
dread
enclosures
of
utter
silence
the
whole
house
was
dumb
the
very
street
had
no
sound
in
it
she
could
not
endure
it
how
dare
tonson
she
sprang
up
and
rang
the
bell
again
and
again
until
its
sound
came
back
to
her
pealing
through
the
place
then
she
waited
again
it
seemed
to
her
that
five
minutes
passed
before
she
heard
the
smart
young
footman
mounting
the
stairs
slowly
she
did
not
wait
for
his
knock
upon
the
door
but
opened
it
herself
how
dare
tonson
she
began
i
have
rung
four
or
five
times
how
dare
she
the
smart
young
footman
manner
had
been
formed
in
a
good
school
it
was
attentive
impersonal
i
do
know
he
answered
what
do
you
mean
what
does
she
mean
where
is
she
feather
felt
almost
breathless
before
his
unperturbed
good
style
i
do
know
he
answered
as
before
then
with
the
same
unbiassed
bearing
added
none
of
us
know
she
has
gone
away
feather
clutched
the
door
handle
because
she
felt
herself
swaying
away
away
the
words
were
a
faint
gasp
she
packed
her
trunk
yesterday
and
carried
it
away
with
her
on
a
about
an
hour
ago
feather
dropped
her
hand
from
the
knob
of
the
door
and
trailed
back
to
the
chair
she
had
left
sinking
into
it
helplessly
who
who
will
dress
me
she
half
wailed
i
do
know
replied
the
young
footman
his
excellent
manner
presuming
no
suggestion
or
opinion
whatever
he
added
however
cook
wishes
to
speak
to
you
tell
her
to
come
to
me
here
feather
said
and
i
i
want
a
cup
of
beef
tea
yes
with
entire
respect
and
the
door
closed
quietly
behind
him
it
was
not
long
before
it
was
opened
again
cook
had
knocked
and
feather
had
told
her
to
come
in
most
cooks
are
stout
but
this
one
was
not
she
was
a
thin
tall
woman
with
square
shoulders
and
a
square
face
somewhat
reddened
by
constant
proximity
to
fires
she
had
been
trained
at
a
cooking
school
she
carried
a
pile
of
small
account
books
but
she
brought
nothing
else
i
wanted
some
beef
tea
cook
said
feather
protestingly
there
is
no
beef
tea
said
cook
there
is
neither
beef
nor
stock
nor
liebig
in
the
house
why
why
not
stammered
feather
and
she
stammered
because
even
her
lack
of
perception
saw
something
in
the
woman
face
which
was
new
to
her
it
was
a
sort
of
finality
she
held
out
the
pile
of
small
books
here
are
the
books
was
her
explanation
perhaps
as
you
do
like
to
be
troubled
with
such
things
you
do
know
how
far
behind
they
are
nothing
has
been
paid
for
months
it
been
an
fight
to
get
the
things
that
was
wanted
it
not
an
agreeable
thing
for
a
cook
to
have
to
struggle
and
plead
had
to
do
it
because
i
had
my
reputation
to
think
of
and
i
send
up
rubbish
when
there
was
company
feather
felt
herself
growing
pale
as
she
sat
and
stared
at
her
cook
drew
near
and
laid
one
little
book
after
another
on
the
small
table
near
her
that
the
butcher
book
she
said
he
sent
nothing
in
for
three
days
we
been
living
on
leavings
he
sent
his
last
he
says
and
he
means
it
this
is
the
baker
he
not
been
for
a
week
i
made
up
rolls
because
i
had
some
flour
left
it
done
now
and
he
done
this
is
groceries
and
mercom
fees
wrote
to
when
the
last
month
supply
came
that
it
would
be
the
last
until
payment
was
made
this
is
wines
and
coal
and
wood
and
laundry
and
milk
and
here
is
wages
which
ca
go
on
any
longer
feather
threw
up
her
hands
and
quite
wildly
oh
go
away
go
away
she
cried
if
lawless
were
here
he
is
cook
interposed
not
fiercely
but
in
a
way
more
terrifying
than
any
ferocity
could
have
been
a
way
which
pointed
steadily
to
the
end
of
things
as
long
as
there
a
gentleman
in
a
house
there
generally
a
sort
of
a
prospect
that
things
may
be
settled
some
way
at
any
rate
there
someone
to
go
and
speak
your
mind
to
even
if
you
have
to
give
up
your
place
but
when
there
no
gentleman
and
nothing
and
nobody
respectable
people
with
their
livings
to
make
have
got
to
protect
themselves
the
woman
had
no
intention
of
being
insolent
her
simple
statement
that
her
employer
death
had
left
nothing
and
nobody
was
prompted
by
no
consciously
ironic
realization
of
the
diaphanousness
of
feather
as
for
the
rest
she
had
been
professionally
trained
to
take
care
of
her
interests
as
well
as
to
cook
and
the
ethics
of
the
days
of
her
grandmother
when
there
had
been
servants
with
actual
affections
had
not
reached
her
oh
go
away
go
feather
almost
shrieked
i
am
going
so
are
edward
and
emma
and
louisa
it
no
use
waiting
and
giving
the
month
notice
we
should
save
the
month
wages
and
the
would
feed
us
we
ca
stay
here
and
starve
and
it
a
time
of
the
year
when
places
has
to
be
looked
for
you
ca
hold
it
against
us
it
better
for
you
to
have
us
out
of
the
house
tonight
which
is
when
our
boxes
will
be
taken
away
then
was
feather
seized
with
a
panic
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
found
herself
facing
mere
common
facts
which
rose
before
her
like
a
solid
wall
of
stone
not
to
be
leapt
or
crept
under
or
bored
through
or
slipped
round
she
was
so
overthrown
and
bewildered
that
she
could
not
even
think
of
any
clever
and
rapidly
constructed
lie
which
would
help
her
indeed
she
was
so
aghast
that
she
did
not
remember
that
there
were
such
things
as
lies
do
you
mean
she
cried
out
that
you
are
all
going
to
leave
the
house
that
there
wo
be
any
servants
to
wait
on
me
that
there
nothing
to
eat
or
drink
that
i
shall
have
to
stay
here
alone
and
starve
we
should
have
to
starve
if
we
stayed
answered
cook
simply
and
of
course
there
are
a
few
things
left
in
the
pantry
and
closets
and
you
might
get
in
a
woman
by
the
day
you
wo
starve
you
got
your
family
in
jersey
we
waited
because
we
thought
and
darrel
would
be
sure
to
come
my
father
is
ill
i
think
he
dying
my
mother
could
not
leave
him
for
a
moment
perhaps
he
dead
now
feather
wailed
you
got
your
london
friends
feather
literally
beat
her
hands
together
my
friends
can
i
go
to
people
houses
and
knock
at
their
front
door
and
tell
them
i
have
any
servants
or
anything
to
eat
can
i
do
that
can
i
and
she
said
it
as
if
she
were
going
crazy
the
woman
had
said
what
she
had
come
to
say
as
spokeswoman
for
the
rest
it
had
not
been
pleasant
but
she
knew
she
had
been
quite
within
her
rights
and
dealt
with
plain
facts
but
she
did
not
enjoy
the
prospect
of
seeing
her
little
fool
of
a
mistress
raving
in
hysterics
you
must
let
yourself
go
she
said
you
better
lie
down
a
bit
and
try
to
get
quiet
she
hesitated
a
moment
looking
at
the
pretty
ruin
who
had
risen
from
her
seat
and
stood
trembling
it
not
my
place
of
course
to
make
suggestions
she
said
quietly
but
had
you
ever
thought
of
sending
for
lord
coombe
feather
actually
found
the
torn
film
of
her
mind
caught
for
a
second
by
something
which
wore
a
form
of
reality
cook
saw
that
her
tremor
appeared
to
verge
on
steadying
itself
coombe
she
faintly
breathed
as
if
to
herself
and
not
to
cook
coombe
his
lordship
was
very
friendly
with
lawless
and
he
seemed
fond
of
coming
to
the
house
was
presented
as
a
sort
of
added
argument
if
you
lie
down
i
bring
you
a
cup
of
tea
though
it
ca
be
beef
feather
staggered
again
to
her
bed
and
dropped
flat
upon
it
flat
as
a
slim
little
pancake
in
folds
of
thin
black
stuff
which
hung
and
floated
i
ca
bring
you
cream
said
cook
as
she
went
out
of
the
room
louisa
has
had
nothing
but
condensed
milk
since
yesterday
to
give
miss
robin
groaned
feather
not
in
horror
of
the
tea
without
cream
though
that
was
awful
enough
in
its
significance
but
because
this
was
the
first
time
since
the
falling
to
pieces
of
her
world
that
she
had
given
a
thought
to
the
added
calamity
of
robin
chapter
iv
if
one
were
to
devote
one
mental
energies
to
speculation
as
to
what
is
going
on
behind
the
noncommittal
fronts
of
any
row
of
houses
in
any
great
city
the
imaginative
mind
might
be
led
far
bricks
mortar
windows
doors
steps
which
lead
up
to
the
threshold
are
what
are
to
be
seen
from
the
outside
nothing
particular
may
be
transpiring
within
the
walls
or
tragedies
crimes
hideous
suffering
may
be
enclosed
the
conclusion
is
obvious
to
banality
but
as
suggestive
as
banal
so
suggestive
in
fact
that
the
and
too
imaginative
had
better
for
their
own
comfort
sake
leave
the
matter
alone
in
most
cases
the
existing
conditions
would
not
be
altered
even
if
one
knocked
at
the
door
and
insisted
on
entering
with
drawn
sword
in
the
form
of
attendant
policeman
the
outside
of
the
slice
of
a
house
in
which
feather
lived
was
still
rather
fresh
from
its
last
decorative
touching
up
it
had
been
painted
cream
colour
and
had
white
doors
and
windows
and
green
window
boxes
with
variegated
vinca
vines
trailing
from
them
and
pink
geraniums
dark
blue
lobelia
and
ferns
filling
the
earth
stuffed
in
by
the
florist
who
provided
such
adornments
frequently
glanced
at
it
and
thought
it
a
nice
little
house
whose
amusing
diminutiveness
was
a
sort
of
attraction
it
was
rather
like
a
new
doll
house
no
one
glancing
at
it
in
passing
at
the
closing
of
this
particular
day
had
reason
to
suspect
that
any
unaccustomed
event
was
taking
place
behind
the
front
the
front
door
brasses
had
been
polished
the
watered
and
no
cries
for
aid
issued
from
the
rooms
behind
them
the
house
was
indeed
quiet
both
inside
and
out
inside
it
was
indeed
even
quieter
than
usual
the
servants
preparation
for
departure
had
been
made
gradually
and
undisturbedly
there
had
been
exhaustive
quiet
discussion
of
the
subject
each
night
for
weeks
even
before
robert
illness
the
smart
young
footman
edward
who
had
means
of
gaining
practical
information
had
constituted
himself
a
sort
of
private
detective
he
had
in
time
learned
all
that
was
to
be
learned
this
it
had
made
itself
clear
to
him
on
investigation
was
not
one
of
those
cases
when
to
wait
for
evolutionary
family
events
might
be
the
part
of
discretion
there
were
no
prospects
ahead
none
at
all
matters
would
only
get
worse
and
the
whole
thing
would
end
in
everybody
not
only
losing
their
unpaid
back
wages
but
having
to
walk
out
into
the
street
through
the
door
of
a
disgraced
household
whose
owners
would
be
turned
out
into
the
street
also
when
their
belongings
were
sold
over
their
heads
better
get
out
before
everything
went
to
pieces
and
there
were
unpleasantnesses
there
would
be
unpleasantnesses
because
there
was
no
denying
that
the
had
been
played
tricks
with
was
only
one
of
a
lot
of
pretty
daughters
whose
father
was
a
poor
country
doctor
in
jersey
he
had
had
a
stroke
himself
and
his
widow
would
have
nothing
to
live
on
when
he
died
that
was
what
lawless
had
to
look
to
as
to
lord
lawdor
edward
had
learned
from
those
who
did
know
that
he
had
never
approved
of
his
nephew
and
that
he
said
he
was
a
fool
for
marrying
and
had
absolutely
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him
he
had
six
boys
and
a
girl
now
and
big
estates
were
what
they
had
been
everyone
knew
there
was
only
one
thing
left
for
cook
and
edward
and
emma
and
louisa
to
do
and
that
was
to
get
out
without
any
talk
or
argument
she
not
one
that
wo
find
someone
to
look
after
her
ended
edward
somebody
or
other
will
take
her
up
because
they
be
sorry
for
her
but
us
lot
are
widows
and
orphans
no
one
going
to
be
sorry
for
us
or
care
a
hang
what
we
been
let
in
for
the
longer
we
stay
the
longer
we
wo
be
paid
he
was
not
a
particularly
depraved
or
cynical
young
footman
but
he
laughed
a
little
at
the
end
of
his
speech
there
the
marquis
he
added
he
been
running
in
and
out
long
enough
to
make
a
good
bit
of
talk
his
time
to
turn
up
after
she
had
taken
her
cup
of
tea
without
cream
feather
had
fallen
asleep
in
reaction
from
her
excited
agitation
it
was
in
accord
with
the
inevitable
trend
of
her
being
that
even
before
her
eyes
closed
she
had
ceased
to
believe
that
the
servants
were
really
going
to
leave
the
house
it
seemed
too
ridiculous
a
thing
to
happen
she
was
possessed
of
no
logic
which
could
lead
her
to
a
realization
of
the
indubitable
fact
that
there
was
no
reason
why
servants
who
could
neither
be
paid
nor
provided
with
food
should
remain
in
a
place
the
mild
stimulation
of
the
tea
also
gave
rise
to
the
happy
thought
that
she
would
not
give
them
any
references
if
they
behaved
badly
it
did
not
present
itself
to
her
that
references
from
a
house
of
cards
which
had
ignominiously
fallen
to
pieces
and
which
henceforth
would
represent
only
shady
failure
would
be
of
no
use
so
she
fell
asleep
when
she
awakened
the
lights
were
lighted
in
the
streets
and
one
directly
across
the
way
threw
its
reflection
into
her
bedroom
it
lit
up
the
little
table
near
which
she
had
sat
and
the
first
thing
she
saw
was
the
pile
of
small
account
books
the
next
was
that
the
light
which
revealed
them
also
fell
brightly
on
the
glass
knob
of
the
door
which
led
into
robert
room
she
turned
her
eyes
away
quickly
with
a
nervous
shudder
she
had
a
horror
of
the
nearness
of
rob
room
if
there
had
been
another
part
of
the
house
in
which
she
could
have
slept
she
would
have
fled
to
it
as
soon
as
he
was
taken
ill
but
the
house
was
too
small
to
have
parts
the
tiny
piled
themselves
on
top
of
the
the
master
bedrooms
on
top
of
the
and
the
nurseries
and
attics
where
robin
and
the
servants
slept
one
on
the
other
at
the
top
of
the
house
so
she
had
been
obliged
to
stay
and
endure
everything
rob
cramped
quarters
had
always
been
full
of
smart
boots
and
the
smell
of
cigars
and
men
clothes
he
had
moved
about
a
good
deal
and
had
whistled
and
laughed
and
sworn
and
grumbled
they
had
neither
of
them
had
bad
tempers
so
that
they
had
not
quarrelled
with
each
other
they
had
talked
through
the
open
door
when
they
were
dressing
and
they
had
invented
clever
tricks
which
helped
them
to
get
out
of
money
scrapes
and
they
had
gossiped
and
made
fun
of
people
and
now
the
door
was
locked
and
the
room
was
a
sort
of
horror
she
could
never
think
of
it
without
seeing
the
stiff
hard
figure
on
the
bed
the
straight
close
line
of
the
mouth
and
the
white
hard
nose
sharpened
and
narrowed
as
rob
had
never
been
somehow
she
particularly
could
not
bear
the
recollection
of
the
sharp
unnatural
modeling
of
the
hard
white
nose
she
could
not
bear
it
she
found
herself
recalling
it
the
moment
she
saw
the
light
on
the
door
handle
and
she
got
up
to
move
about
and
try
to
forget
it
it
was
then
that
she
went
to
the
window
and
looked
down
into
the
street
probably
attracted
by
some
slight
noise
though
she
was
not
exactly
aware
that
she
had
heard
anything
she
must
have
heard
something
however
two
cabs
were
standing
at
the
front
door
and
the
cabman
assisted
by
edward
were
putting
trunks
on
top
of
them
they
were
servants
trunks
and
cook
was
already
inside
the
first
cab
which
was
filled
with
paper
parcels
and
odds
and
ends
even
as
her
mistress
watched
emma
got
in
carrying
a
sedate
she
was
the
and
a
sedate
person
the
first
cab
drove
away
as
soon
as
its
door
was
closed
and
the
cabman
mounted
to
his
seat
louisa
looking
wholly
unprofessional
without
her
nurse
cap
and
apron
and
wearing
a
navy
blue
costume
and
a
hat
with
a
wing
in
it
entered
the
second
cab
followed
by
edward
intensely
suggesting
private
life
and
possible
connection
with
a
bank
the
second
cab
followed
the
first
and
feather
having
lost
her
breath
looked
after
them
as
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
when
they
were
quite
out
of
sight
she
turned
back
into
the
room
the
colour
had
left
her
skin
and
her
eyes
were
so
wide
stretched
and
her
face
so
drawn
and
pinched
with
abject
terror
that
her
prettiness
itself
had
left
her
they
gone
all
of
them
she
gasped
she
stopped
a
moment
her
chest
rising
and
falling
then
she
added
even
more
breathlessly
there
no
one
left
in
the
house
it
empty
this
was
what
was
going
on
behind
the
front
the
white
windows
and
green
of
the
slice
of
a
house
as
motors
and
carriages
passed
it
that
evening
on
their
way
to
dinner
parties
and
theatres
and
later
as
the
policeman
walked
up
and
down
slowly
upon
his
beat
inside
a
dim
light
in
the
small
hall
showed
a
remote
corner
where
on
a
peg
above
a
decorative
seat
hung
a
man
hat
of
the
highest
gloss
and
latest
form
and
on
the
next
peg
a
smart
evening
overcoat
they
had
belonged
to
robert
who
was
dead
and
needed
such
things
no
more
the
same
dim
light
showed
the
steep
narrowness
of
the
staircase
mounting
into
gruesome
little
corners
of
shadows
while
the
miniature
illumined
only
from
the
street
seemed
to
await
an
explanation
of
dimness
and
chairs
unfilled
combined
with
unnatural
silence
it
would
have
been
the
silence
of
the
tomb
but
that
it
was
now
and
then
broken
by
something
like
a
half
smothered
shriek
followed
by
a
sort
of
moaning
which
made
their
way
through
the
ceiling
from
the
room
above
feather
had
at
first
run
up
and
down
the
room
like
a
frightened
cat
as
she
had
done
in
the
afternoon
afterwards
she
had
had
something
like
hysterics
falling
face
downward
upon
the
carpet
and
clutching
her
hair
until
it
fell
down
she
was
not
a
person
to
be
judged
she
was
one
of
the
unexplained
incidents
of
existence
the
hour
has
passed
when
the
clearly
moral
can
sum
up
the
responsibilities
of
a
creature
born
apparently
without
brain
or
soul
or
courage
those
who
aspire
to
such
morals
as
are
expressed
by
fairness
mere
fairness
are
much
given
to
hesitation
courage
had
never
been
demanded
of
feather
so
far
she
had
none
whatever
and
now
she
only
felt
panic
and
resentment
she
had
no
time
to
be
pathetic
about
robert
being
too
much
occupied
with
herself
robert
was
dead
she
was
alive
here
in
an
empty
house
with
no
money
and
no
servants
she
suddenly
and
rather
awfully
realized
that
she
did
not
know
a
single
person
whom
it
would
not
be
frantic
to
expect
anything
from
nobody
had
money
enough
for
themselves
however
rich
they
were
the
richer
they
were
the
more
they
needed
it
was
when
this
thought
came
to
her
that
she
clutched
her
hands
in
her
hair
the
pretty
and
smart
women
and
agreeable
more
or
less
good
looking
men
who
had
chattered
and
laughed
and
made
love
in
her
were
chattering
laughing
and
making
love
in
other
houses
at
this
very
moment
or
they
were
at
the
theatre
applauding
some
fashionable
at
this
very
moment
while
she
lay
on
the
carpet
in
the
dark
and
every
little
room
in
the
house
had
horror
shut
inside
its
closed
doors
particularly
robert
room
which
was
so
hideously
close
to
her
own
and
where
there
seemed
still
to
lie
moveless
on
the
bed
the
stiff
hard
figure
it
was
when
she
recalled
this
that
the
unnatural
silence
of
the
was
intruded
upon
by
the
brief
hysteric
shriek
and
the
moaning
which
made
its
way
through
the
ceiling
she
felt
almost
as
if
the
door
handle
might
turn
and
something
stiff
and
cold
try
to
come
in
so
the
hours
went
on
behind
the
outer
walls
and
the
white
windows
and
gay
and
the
street
became
more
and
more
silent
so
silent
at
last
that
when
the
policeman
walked
past
on
his
beat
his
heavy
regular
footfall
seemed
loud
and
almost
resounding
to
even
vaguely
put
to
herself
any
question
involving
action
would
not
have
been
within
the
scope
of
her
mentality
even
when
she
began
to
realize
that
she
was
beginning
to
feel
faint
for
want
of
food
she
did
not
dare
to
contemplate
going
downstairs
to
look
for
something
to
eat
what
did
she
know
about
downstairs
she
had
never
there
and
had
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
louisa
complaints
that
the
kitchen
and
servants
hall
were
small
and
dark
and
inconvenient
and
that
cockroaches
ran
about
she
had
cheerfully
accepted
the
simple
philosophy
that
london
servants
were
used
to
these
things
and
if
they
did
their
work
it
did
not
really
matter
but
to
go
out
of
one
room
in
the
horrible
stillness
and
creep
downstairs
having
to
turn
up
the
gas
as
one
went
and
to
face
the
basement
steps
and
cockroaches
scuttling
away
would
be
even
more
impossible
than
to
starve
she
sat
upon
the
floor
her
hair
tumbling
about
her
shoulders
and
her
thin
black
dress
crushed
i
give
almost
anything
for
a
cup
of
coffee
she
protested
feebly
and
there
no
use
in
ringing
the
bell
her
mother
ought
to
have
come
whether
her
father
was
ill
or
not
he
was
dead
robert
was
dead
and
her
mother
ought
to
have
come
so
that
whatever
happened
she
would
not
be
quite
alone
and
something
could
be
done
for
her
it
was
probably
this
tender
thought
of
her
mother
which
brought
back
the
recollection
of
her
wedding
day
and
a
certain
wedding
present
she
had
received
it
was
a
pretty
silver
travelling
flask
and
she
remembered
that
it
must
be
in
her
now
and
there
was
some
cognac
left
in
it
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
place
where
the
bag
was
kept
cognac
raised
your
spirits
and
made
you
go
to
sleep
and
if
she
could
sleep
until
morning
the
house
would
not
be
so
frightening
by
daylight
and
something
might
happen
the
little
flask
was
almost
full
neither
she
nor
robert
had
cared
much
about
cognac
she
poured
some
into
a
glass
with
water
and
drank
it
because
she
was
unaccustomed
to
stimulant
it
made
her
feel
quite
warm
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
forgot
that
she
had
been
hungry
and
realized
that
she
was
not
so
frightened
it
was
such
a
relief
not
to
be
terrified
it
was
as
if
a
pain
had
stopped
she
actually
picked
up
one
or
two
of
the
account
books
and
glanced
at
the
totals
if
you
could
pay
bills
you
could
and
nobody
was
put
in
prison
for
debt
in
these
days
besides
she
would
not
have
been
put
in
prison
rob
would
and
rob
was
dead
something
would
happen
something
as
she
began
to
arrange
her
hair
for
the
night
she
remembered
what
cook
had
said
about
lord
coombe
she
has
cried
until
she
did
not
look
as
lovely
as
usual
but
after
she
had
bathed
her
eyes
with
cold
they
began
to
seem
only
shadowy
and
faintly
flushed
and
her
fine
hair
was
wonderful
when
it
hung
over
each
shoulder
in
wide
soft
plaits
she
might
be
a
of
fifteen
a
delicate
lacy
was
one
of
the
most
becoming
things
one
wore
it
was
a
pity
one
could
wear
them
to
parties
there
was
nothing
the
least
indecent
about
them
millicent
hardwicke
had
been
photographed
in
one
of
hers
and
no
one
had
suspected
what
it
was
yes
she
would
send
a
little
note
to
coombe
she
knew
madame
helene
had
only
let
her
have
her
beautiful
mourning
because
the
things
she
had
created
were
quite
unique
thin
gauzy
black
floating
or
clinging
she
had
been
quite
happy
the
morning
she
gave
helene
her
orders
tomorrow
when
she
had
slept
through
the
night
and
it
was
broad
daylight
again
she
would
be
able
to
think
of
things
to
say
in
her
letter
to
lord
coombe
she
would
have
to
be
a
little
careful
because
he
did
not
like
things
to
bore
death
and
widows
might
a
little
at
first
she
had
heard
him
say
once
that
he
did
not
wish
to
regard
himself
in
the
light
of
a
charitable
institution
it
would
do
to
frighten
him
away
perhaps
if
he
continued
coming
to
the
house
and
seemed
very
intimate
the
might
be
managed
she
felt
much
less
helpless
and
when
she
was
ready
for
bed
she
took
a
little
more
cognac
the
flush
had
faded
from
her
and
bloomed
in
delicious
rose
on
her
cheeks
as
she
crept
between
the
cool
sheets
and
nestled
down
on
her
pillow
she
had
a
delightful
sense
of
increasing
comfort
comfort
what
a
beautiful
thing
it
was
to
go
to
sleep
and
then
she
was
disturbed
started
out
of
the
divine
doze
stealing
upon
her
by
a
shrill
prolonged
wailing
shriek
it
came
from
the
night
nursery
and
at
the
moment
it
seemed
almost
worse
than
anything
which
had
occurred
all
through
the
day
it
brought
everything
back
so
hideously
she
had
of
course
forgotten
robin
again
and
it
was
robin
and
louisa
had
gone
away
with
edward
she
had
perhaps
put
the
child
to
sleep
discreetly
before
she
went
and
now
she
had
wakened
and
was
screaming
feather
had
heard
that
she
was
a
child
with
a
temper
but
by
fair
means
or
foul
louisa
had
somehow
managed
to
prevent
her
from
being
a
nuisance
the
shrieks
shocked
her
into
sitting
upright
in
bed
their
shrillness
tearing
through
the
utter
soundlessness
of
the
empty
house
brought
back
all
her
terrors
and
set
her
heart
beating
at
a
gallop
i
i
wo
she
protested
fairly
with
chattering
teeth
i
wo
i
wo
she
had
never
done
anything
for
the
child
since
its
birth
she
did
not
know
how
to
do
anything
she
had
not
wanted
to
know
to
reach
her
now
she
would
be
obliged
to
go
out
in
the
dark
the
she
would
have
to
light
was
actually
close
to
the
outer
door
of
robert
bedroom
the
room
if
she
did
not
die
of
panic
while
she
was
trying
to
light
it
she
would
have
to
make
her
way
almost
in
the
dark
up
the
steep
crooked
little
staircase
which
led
to
the
nurseries
and
the
awful
little
creature
screams
would
be
going
on
all
the
time
making
the
blackness
and
dead
silence
of
the
house
below
more
filled
with
horror
by
contrast
more
shut
off
and
at
the
same
time
more
likely
to
waken
to
some
horror
which
was
new
could
even
if
i
wanted
to
she
quaked
i
dare
i
dare
i
would
do
it
for
a
million
pounds
and
she
flung
herself
down
again
shuddering
and
burrowing
her
head
under
the
coverings
and
pillows
she
dragged
over
her
ears
to
shut
out
the
sounds
the
screams
had
taken
on
a
more
determined
note
and
a
fiercer
shrillness
which
the
still
house
heard
well
and
made
the
most
of
but
they
were
so
far
deadened
for
feather
that
she
began
beneath
her
soft
barrier
to
protest
pantingly
i
should
know
what
to
do
if
i
went
if
no
one
goes
near
her
she
cry
herself
to
sleep
it
it
only
temper
what
a
horrible
wail
it
it
sounds
like
a
a
lost
soul
but
she
did
not
stir
from
the
bed
she
burrowed
deeper
under
the
bed
clothes
and
held
the
pillow
closer
to
her
ears
it
did
sound
like
a
lost
soul
at
times
what
panic
possesses
a
baby
who
cries
in
the
darkness
alone
no
one
will
ever
know
and
one
may
perhaps
give
thanks
to
whatever
gods
there
be
that
the
baby
itself
does
not
remember
what
awful
woe
of
sudden
unprotectedness
when
life
exists
only
through
protection
what
piteous
panic
in
the
midst
of
black
unmercifulness
inarticulate
sound
howsoever
wildly
shrill
can
neither
explain
nor
express
robin
knew
only
louisa
warmth
food
sleep
and
waking
or
if
she
knew
more
she
was
not
yet
aware
that
she
did
she
had
reached
the
age
when
she
generally
slept
through
the
night
she
might
not
have
disturbed
her
mother
until
daylight
but
louisa
had
with
forethought
given
her
an
infant
sleeping
potion
it
had
disagreed
with
and
awakened
her
she
was
uncomfortable
and
darkness
enveloped
her
a
cry
or
so
and
louisa
would
ordinarily
have
come
to
her
sleepy
and
rather
out
of
temper
but
knowing
what
to
do
in
this
strange
night
the
normal
cry
of
warning
and
demand
produced
no
result
no
one
came
the
discomfort
continued
the
blackness
remained
black
the
cries
became
shrieks
but
nothing
followed
the
shrieks
developed
into
prolonged
screams
no
louisa
no
light
no
milk
the
blackness
drew
in
closer
and
became
a
thing
to
be
fought
with
wild
little
beating
hands
not
a
glimmer
not
a
rustle
not
a
sound
then
came
the
cries
of
the
lost
soul
alone
alone
in
a
black
world
of
space
in
which
there
was
not
even
another
lost
soul
and
then
the
panics
of
which
there
have
been
no
records
and
never
will
be
because
if
the
panic
stricken
does
not
die
in
mysterious
convulsions
he
or
she
grows
away
from
the
memory
of
a
formless
past
except
that
perhaps
unexplained
nightmares
from
which
one
wakens
quaking
with
cold
sweat
may
vaguely
repeat
the
long
hidden
thing
what
the
child
robin
knew
in
the
dark
perhaps
the
silent
house
which
echoed
her
might
curiously
have
known
but
the
shrieks
wore
themselves
out
at
last
and
sobs
came
awful
little
sobs
shuddering
through
the
tiny
breast
and
shaking
the
baby
body
a
baby
sobs
are
unspeakable
things
incredible
things
slower
and
slower
robin
came
with
small
deep
gasps
and
chokings
between
and
when
an
uninfantile
druglike
sleep
came
the
bitter
hopeless
beaten
little
sobs
went
on
but
feather
head
was
still
burrowed
under
the
soft
protection
of
the
pillow
chapter
v
the
morning
was
a
brighter
one
than
london
usually
indulges
in
and
the
sun
made
its
way
into
feather
bedroom
to
the
revealing
of
its
coral
pink
glow
and
comfort
she
had
always
liked
her
bedroom
and
had
usually
wakened
in
it
to
the
sense
of
luxuriousness
it
is
possible
a
pet
cat
feels
when
it
wakens
to
stretch
itself
on
a
cushion
with
its
saucer
of
cream
awaiting
it
but
she
did
not
awaken
either
to
a
sense
of
brightness
or
luxury
this
morning
she
had
slept
it
was
true
but
once
or
twice
when
the
pillow
had
slipped
aside
she
had
found
herself
disturbed
by
the
sound
of
the
wailing
of
some
little
animal
which
had
caused
her
automatically
and
really
scarcely
consciously
to
replace
the
pillow
it
had
only
happened
at
long
intervals
because
it
is
nature
that
an
exhausted
baby
falls
asleep
when
it
is
worn
out
robin
had
probably
slept
almost
as
much
as
her
mother
feather
staring
at
the
pinkness
around
her
reached
at
last
with
the
assistance
of
a
certain
physical
consciousness
a
sort
of
spiritless
intention
she
asleep
now
she
murmured
i
hope
she
wo
waken
for
a
long
time
i
feel
faint
i
shall
have
to
find
something
to
eat
if
it
only
biscuits
then
she
lay
and
tried
to
remember
what
cook
had
said
about
her
not
starving
she
said
there
were
a
few
things
left
in
the
pantry
and
closets
perhaps
there
some
condensed
milk
how
do
you
mix
it
up
if
she
cries
i
might
go
and
give
her
some
it
would
be
so
awful
now
it
daylight
she
felt
shaky
when
she
got
out
of
bed
and
stood
on
her
feet
she
had
not
had
a
maid
in
her
girlhood
so
she
could
dress
herself
much
as
she
detested
to
do
it
after
she
had
begun
however
she
could
not
help
becoming
rather
interested
because
the
dress
she
had
worn
the
day
before
had
become
crushed
and
she
put
on
a
fresh
one
she
had
not
worn
at
all
it
was
thin
and
soft
also
and
black
was
quite
startlingly
becoming
to
her
she
would
wear
this
one
when
lord
coombe
came
after
she
wrote
to
him
it
was
silly
of
her
not
to
have
written
before
though
she
knew
he
had
left
town
after
the
funeral
letters
would
be
forwarded
it
will
be
quite
bright
in
the
now
she
said
to
encourage
herself
and
tonson
once
said
that
the
only
places
the
sun
came
into
below
stairs
were
the
pantry
and
kitchen
and
it
only
stayed
about
an
hour
early
in
the
morning
i
must
get
there
as
soon
as
i
can
when
she
had
so
dressed
herself
that
the
reflection
the
mirror
gave
back
to
her
was
of
the
nature
of
a
slight
physical
stimulant
she
opened
her
bedroom
door
and
faced
exploration
of
the
deserted
house
below
with
a
quaking
sense
of
the
proportions
of
the
inevitable
she
got
down
the
narrow
stairs
casting
a
frightened
glance
at
the
emptiness
of
the
which
seemed
to
stare
at
her
as
she
passed
them
there
was
sun
in
the
and
when
she
opened
the
sideboard
she
found
some
wine
in
decanters
and
some
biscuits
and
even
a
few
nuts
and
some
raisins
and
oranges
she
put
them
on
the
table
and
sat
down
and
ate
some
of
them
and
began
to
feel
a
little
less
shaky
if
she
had
been
allowed
time
to
sit
longer
and
digest
and
reflect
she
might
have
reached
the
point
of
deciding
on
what
she
would
write
to
lord
coombe
she
had
not
the
pen
of
a
ready
writer
and
it
must
be
thought
over
but
just
when
she
was
beginning
to
be
conscious
of
the
pleasant
warmth
of
the
sun
which
shone
on
her
shoulders
from
the
window
she
was
almost
startled
our
of
her
chair
by
hearing
again
stealing
down
the
staircase
from
the
upper
regions
that
faint
wail
like
a
little
cat
just
the
moment
the
very
moment
i
begin
to
feel
a
little
quieted
and
try
to
think
she
begins
again
she
cried
out
worse
then
anything
large
crystal
tears
ran
down
her
face
and
upon
the
polished
table
i
suppose
she
would
starve
to
death
if
i
did
give
her
some
food
and
then
should
be
blamed
people
would
be
horrid
about
it
i
got
nothing
to
eat
myself
she
must
at
any
rate
manage
to
stop
the
crying
before
she
could
write
to
coombe
she
would
be
obliged
to
go
down
into
the
pantry
and
look
for
some
condensed
milk
the
creature
had
no
teeth
but
perhaps
she
could
mumble
a
biscuit
or
a
few
raisins
if
she
could
be
made
to
swallow
a
little
port
wine
it
might
make
her
sleepy
the
sun
was
paying
its
brief
morning
visit
to
the
kitchen
and
pantry
when
she
reached
there
but
a
few
cockroaches
scuttled
away
before
her
and
made
her
utter
a
hysterical
little
scream
but
there
was
some
condensed
milk
and
there
was
a
little
warm
water
in
a
kettle
because
the
fire
was
not
quite
out
she
imperfectly
mixed
a
decoction
and
filled
a
bottle
which
ought
not
to
have
been
downstairs
but
had
been
brought
and
left
there
by
louisa
as
a
result
of
tender
moments
with
edward
when
she
put
the
bottle
and
some
biscuits
and
scraps
of
cold
ham
on
a
tray
because
she
could
not
carry
them
all
in
her
hands
her
sense
of
outrage
and
despair
made
her
almost
sob
i
am
just
like
a
servant
carrying
trays
upstairs
she
wept
i
i
might
be
edward
or
or
louisa
and
her
woe
increased
when
she
added
in
the
the
port
wine
and
nuts
and
raisins
and
macaroons
as
viands
which
might
somehow
add
to
infant
diet
and
induce
sleep
she
was
not
sure
of
course
but
she
knew
they
sucked
things
and
liked
sweets
a
baby
left
unattended
to
scream
itself
to
sleep
and
awakening
to
scream
itself
to
sleep
again
does
not
present
to
a
resentful
observer
the
flowerlike
bloom
and
beauty
of
infancy
when
feather
carried
her
tray
into
the
night
nursery
and
found
herself
confronting
the
disordered
crib
on
which
her
offspring
lay
she
felt
the
child
horrible
to
look
at
its
face
was
disfigured
and
its
eyes
almost
closed
she
trembled
all
over
as
she
put
the
bottle
to
its
mouth
and
saw
the
fiercely
hungry
clutch
of
its
hands
it
was
old
enough
to
clutch
and
clutch
it
did
and
suck
furiously
and
starvingly
even
though
actually
forced
to
stop
once
or
twice
at
first
to
give
vent
to
a
thwarted
remnant
of
a
scream
feather
had
only
seen
it
as
downy
whiteness
and
perfume
in
louisa
arms
or
in
its
carriage
it
had
been
a
singularly
vivid
and
baby
at
whom
people
looked
as
they
passed
who
will
give
her
a
bath
wailed
feather
who
will
change
her
clothes
someone
must
could
a
woman
by
the
day
do
it
cook
said
i
could
get
a
woman
by
the
day
and
then
she
remembered
that
one
got
servants
from
agencies
and
where
were
the
agencies
and
even
a
woman
by
the
day
would
demand
wages
and
food
to
eat
and
then
the
front
door
bell
rang
what
could
she
do
what
could
she
do
go
downstairs
and
open
the
door
herself
and
let
everyone
know
let
the
ringer
go
on
ringing
until
he
was
tired
and
went
away
she
was
indeed
hard
driven
even
though
the
wail
had
ceased
as
robin
clutched
her
bottle
to
her
breast
and
fed
with
frenzy
let
them
go
away
let
them
and
then
came
the
wild
thought
that
it
might
be
something
the
something
which
must
happen
when
things
were
at
their
worst
and
if
it
had
come
and
the
house
seemed
to
be
empty
she
did
not
walk
down
the
stairs
she
ran
her
heart
beat
until
she
reached
the
door
out
of
breath
and
when
she
opened
it
stood
their
panting
the
people
who
waited
upon
the
steps
were
strangers
they
were
very
nice
looking
and
quite
young
a
man
and
a
woman
very
perfectly
dressed
the
man
took
a
piece
of
paper
out
of
his
pocketbook
and
handed
it
to
her
with
an
agreeable
apologetic
courtesy
i
hope
we
have
not
called
early
enough
to
disturb
you
he
said
we
waited
until
eleven
but
we
are
obliged
to
catch
a
train
at
half
past
it
is
an
to
view
from
carson
bayle
he
added
this
because
feather
was
staring
at
the
paper
carson
bayle
were
the
agents
they
had
rented
the
house
from
it
was
carson
bayle
collector
robert
had
met
on
the
threshold
and
sworn
at
two
days
before
he
had
been
taken
ill
they
were
letting
the
house
over
her
head
and
she
would
be
turned
out
into
the
street
the
young
man
and
woman
finding
themselves
gazing
at
this
exquisitely
pretty
creature
in
exquisite
mourning
felt
themselves
appallingly
embarrassed
she
was
plainly
the
widow
carson
had
spoken
of
but
why
did
she
open
the
door
herself
and
why
did
she
look
as
if
she
did
not
understand
indignation
against
carson
bayle
began
to
stir
the
young
man
beg
pardon
so
sorry
i
am
afraid
we
ought
not
to
have
come
he
protested
agents
ought
to
know
better
they
said
you
were
giving
up
the
house
at
once
and
we
were
afraid
someone
might
take
it
feather
held
the
order
to
view
in
her
hand
and
snared
at
them
quite
helplessly
there
are
no
no
servants
to
show
it
to
you
she
said
if
you
could
wait
a
few
days
perhaps
she
was
so
lovely
and
madame
helene
filmy
black
creation
was
in
itself
such
an
appeal
that
the
amiable
young
strangers
gave
up
at
once
oh
certainly
certainly
do
excuse
us
carson
and
bayle
ought
not
to
have
we
are
so
sorry
good
morning
good
morning
they
gave
forth
in
discomfited
sympathy
and
politeness
and
really
quite
scurried
away
having
shut
the
door
on
their
retreat
feather
stood
shivering
i
am
going
to
be
turned
out
of
the
house
i
shall
have
to
live
in
the
street
she
thought
where
shall
i
keep
my
clothes
if
i
live
in
the
street
even
she
knew
that
she
was
thinking
idiotically
of
course
if
everything
was
taken
from
you
and
sold
you
would
have
no
clothes
at
all
and
wardrobes
and
drawers
and
closets
would
not
matter
the
realization
that
scarcely
anything
in
the
house
had
been
paid
for
came
home
to
her
with
a
ghastly
shock
she
staggered
upstairs
to
the
first
in
which
there
was
a
silly
pretty
little
buhl
writing
table
she
felt
even
more
senseless
when
she
sank
into
a
chair
before
it
and
drew
a
sheet
of
towards
her
her
thoughts
would
not
connect
themselves
with
each
other
and
she
could
not
imagine
what
she
ought
to
say
in
her
letter
to
coombe
in
fact
she
seemed
to
have
no
thoughts
at
all
she
could
only
remember
the
things
which
had
happened
and
she
actually
found
she
could
write
nothing
else
there
seemed
nothing
else
in
the
world
dear
lord
coombe
trailed
tremulously
over
the
page
the
house
is
quite
empty
the
servants
have
gone
away
i
have
no
money
and
there
is
not
any
food
and
i
am
going
to
be
turned
out
into
the
street
and
the
baby
is
crying
because
it
is
hungry
she
stopped
there
knowing
it
was
not
what
she
ought
to
say
and
as
she
stopped
and
looked
at
the
words
she
began
herself
to
wail
somewhat
as
robin
had
wailed
in
the
dark
when
she
would
not
listen
or
go
to
her
it
was
like
a
beggar
letter
a
beggar
telling
him
that
she
had
no
money
and
no
food
and
would
be
turned
out
for
unpaid
rent
and
that
the
baby
was
crying
because
it
was
starving
it
a
beggar
letter
just
a
beggar
she
cried
out
aloud
to
the
empty
room
and
it
robin
wail
itself
had
not
been
more
hopeless
than
hers
was
as
she
dropped
her
head
and
let
it
lie
on
the
buhl
table
she
was
not
however
even
to
be
allowed
to
let
it
lie
there
for
the
next
instant
there
fell
on
her
startled
ear
quite
echoing
through
the
house
another
ring
at
the
doorbell
and
two
steely
raps
on
the
smart
brass
knocker
it
was
merely
because
she
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
having
just
lost
her
wits
entirely
that
she
got
up
and
trailed
down
the
staircase
again
when
she
opened
the
door
lord
coombe
the
apotheosis
of
exquisite
fitness
in
form
and
perfect
appointment
as
also
of
perfect
expression
was
standing
on
the
threshold
chapter
vi
if
he
had
meant
to
speak
he
changed
his
mind
after
his
first
sight
of
her
he
merely
came
in
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
curious
experiences
with
which
life
had
provided
him
had
added
finish
to
an
innate
aptness
of
observation
and
a
fine
readiness
in
action
if
she
had
been
of
another
type
he
would
have
saved
both
her
and
himself
a
scene
and
steered
ably
through
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
towards
a
point
where
they
could
have
met
upon
a
normal
plane
a
very
pretty
woman
with
whose
affairs
one
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
and
whose
pretty
home
has
been
the
perfection
of
modern
smartness
of
custom
suddenly
opening
her
front
door
in
the
unexplained
absence
of
a
footman
and
confronting
a
visitor
plainly
upon
the
verge
of
hysteria
suggests
the
necessity
of
promptness

gave
him
not
a
breath
space
she
was
in
fact
not
merely
on
the
verge
of
her
hysteria
she
had
gone
farther
and
here
he
was
oh
here
he
was
she
fell
down
upon
her
knees
and
actually
clasped
his
immaculateness
oh
lord
coombe
lord
coombe
lord
coombe
she
said
it
three
times
because
he
presented
to
her
but
the
one
idea
he
did
not
drag
himself
away
from
her
embrace
but
he
distinctly
removed
himself
from
it
you
must
not
fall
upon
your
knees
lawless
he
said
shall
we
go
into
the
i
was
writing
to
you
i
am
starving
but
it
seemed
too
silly
when
i
wrote
it
and
it
true
her
broken
words
were
as
senseless
in
their
sound
as
she
had
thought
them
when
she
saw
them
written
will
you
come
up
into
the
and
tell
me
exactly
what
you
mean
he
said
and
he
made
her
release
him
and
stand
upon
her
feet
as
the
years
had
passed
he
had
detached
himself
from
so
many
weaknesses
and
their
sequelae
of
emotion
that
he
had
felt
himself
a
safely
unreachable
person
he
was
not
young
and
he
knew
enough
of
the
disagreeableness
of
consequences
to
be
adroit
in
keeping
out
of
the
way
of
apparently
harmless
things
which
might
be
annoying
yet
as
he
followed
and
watched
her
stumbling
up
the
stairs
like
a
punished
child
he
was
aware
that
he
was
abnormally
in
danger
of
pitying
her
as
he
did
not
wish
to
pity
people
the
pity
was
also
something
apart
from
the
feeling
that
it
was
hideous
that
a
creature
so
lovely
so
shallow
and
so
fragile
should
have
been
caught
in
the
great
wheels
of
life
he
knew
what
he
had
come
to
talk
to
her
about
but
he
had
really
no
clear
idea
of
what
her
circumstances
actually
were
most
people
had
of
course
guessed
that
her
husband
had
been
living
on
the
edge
of
his
resources
and
was
accustomed
to
debt
and
duns
but
a
lovely
being
greeting
you
by
clasping
your
knees
and
talking
about
starving
in
this
particular
street
in
mayfair
led
one
to
ask
oneself
what
one
was
walking
into
feather
herself
had
not
known
in
fact
neither
had
any
other
human
being
known
that
there
was
a
special
reason
why
he
had
drifted
into
seeming
rather
to
allow
her
about
why
he
had
finally
been
counted
among
the
frequenters
of
the
narrow
house
and
why
he
had
seemed
to
watch
her
a
good
deal
sometimes
with
an
expression
of
serious
interest
sometimes
with
an
air
of
irritation
and
sometimes
with
no
expression
at
all
but
there
existed
this
reason
and
this
it
was
and
this
alone
which
had
caused
him
to
appear
upon
her
threshold
and
it
had
also
been
the
power
which
had
prevented
his
disengaging
himself
with
more
incisive
finality
when
he
found
himself
ridiculously
clasped
about
the
knees
as
one
who
played
the
part
of
an
obdurate
parent
in
a
melodrama
once
in
the
familiar
surroundings
of
her
her
blondness
and
her
black
gauzy
frock
heightened
all
her
effects
so
extraordinarily
that
he
frankly
admitted
to
himself
that
she
possessed
assets
which
would
have
modified
most
things
to
most
men
as
for
feather
when
she
herself
beheld
him
against
the
background
of
the
same
intimate
aspects
the
effect
of
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
manner
in
which
he
sat
down
in
a
chair
and
a
certain
remotely
dim
hint
in
the
hue
of
his
clothes
and
an
almost
concealed
note
of
some
touch
of
colour
which
scarcely
seemed
to
belong
to
anything
worn
were
so
reminiscent
of
the
days
which
now
seemed
past
forever
that
she
began
to
cry
again
he
received
this
with
discreet
lack
of
melodrama
of
tone
you
must
do
that
lawless
he
said
or
i
shall
burst
into
tears
myself
i
am
a
sensitive
creature
oh
do
say
instead
of
lawless
she
implored
sometimes
you
said
i
will
say
it
now
he
answered
if
you
will
not
weep
it
is
an
adorable
name
i
feel
as
if
i
should
never
hear
it
again
she
shuddered
trying
to
dry
her
eyes
it
is
all
over
what
is
all
over
this
turning
a
hopeless
gaze
upon
the
two
tiny
rooms
crowded
with
and
nonsense
the
parties
and
the
fun
and
everything
in
the
world
i
have
only
had
some
biscuits
and
raisins
to
eat
today
and
the
landlord
is
going
to
turn
me
out
it
seemed
almost
too
preposterous
to
quite
credit
that
she
was
uttering
naked
and
yet
after
a
second
gaze
at
her
he
repeated
what
he
had
said
below
stairs
will
you
tell
me
exactly
what
you
mean
then
he
sat
still
and
listened
while
she
poured
it
all
forth
and
as
he
listened
he
realized
that
it
was
the
mere
every
day
fact
that
they
were
sitting
in
the
slice
of
a
house
with
the
front
and
the
great
lady
in
her
mansion
on
one
side
and
the
millionaire
and
his
splendours
on
the
other
which
peculiarly
added
to
a
certain
hint
of
gruesomeness
in
the
situation
it
was
not
necessary
to
add
colour
and
desperation
to
the
story
any
effort
feather
had
made
in
that
direction
would
only
have
detracted
from
the
nakedness
of
its
stark
facts
they
were
quite
enough
in
themselves
in
their
normal
inevitableness
feather
in
her
pale
and
totally
undignified
panic
presented
the
whole
thing
with
clearness
which
had
without
being
aided
by
her
an
actual
dramatic
value
this
in
spite
of
her
mental
dartings
to
and
from
and
dragging
in
of
points
and
bits
of
scenes
which
were
not
connected
with
each
other
only
a
brain
whose
processes
of
inclusion
and
exclusion
were
final
and
rapid
could
have
followed
her
coombe
watched
her
closely
as
she
talked
no
young
widowed
loneliness
and
were
the
background
of
her
anguish
she
was
her
own
background
and
also
her
own
foreground
the
strength
of
the
fine
body
laid
prone
on
the
bed
of
the
room
she
held
in
horror
the
white
rigid
face
whose
good
looks
had
changed
to
something
she
could
not
bear
to
remember
had
no
pathos
which
was
not
concerned
with
the
fact
that
robert
had
amazingly
and
unnaturally
failed
her
by
dying
and
leaving
her
nothing
but
unpaid
bills
this
truth
indeed
made
the
situation
more
poignantly
and
finally
squalid
as
she
brought
forth
one
detail
after
another
there
were
bills
which
had
been
accumulating
ever
since
they
began
their
life
in
the
narrow
house
there
had
been
who
had
been
juggled
with
promises
made
and
supported
by
adroit
tricks
and
cleverly
invented
misrepresentations
and
lies
which
neither
of
the
pair
had
felt
any
compunctions
about
and
had
indeed
laughed
over
coombe
saw
it
all
though
he
also
saw
that
feather
did
not
know
all
she
was
telling
him
he
could
realize
the
gradually
increasing
pressure
and
anger
at
tricks
which
betrayed
themselves
and
the
gathering
determination
on
the
part
of
the
creditors
to
end
the
matter
in
the
only
way
in
which
it
could
be
ended
it
had
come
to
this
before
robert
illness
and
feather
herself
had
heard
of
fierce
interviews
and
had
seen
threatening
letters
but
she
had
not
believed
they
could
mean
all
they
implied
since
things
had
been
allowed
to
go
on
so
long
she
felt
that
they
would
surely
go
on
longer
in
the
same
way
there
had
been
some
serious
threatening
about
the
rent
and
the
furniture
robert
supporting
idea
had
been
that
he
might
perhaps
get
something
out
of
lawdor
who
would
enjoy
being
the
relation
of
a
fellow
who
was
turned
into
the
street
he
ought
to
have
done
something
feather
complained
robert
would
have
been
lord
lawdor
himself
if
his
uncle
had
died
before
he
had
all
those
disgusting
children
she
was
not
aware
that
coombe
frequently
refrained
from
saying
things
to
her
but
occasionally
allowed
himself
not
to
refrain
he
did
not
refrain
now
from
making
a
simple
comment
but
he
is
extremely
robust
and
he
has
the
children
six
stalwart
boys
and
a
stalwart
girl
family
feeling
has
apparently
gone
out
of
fashion
as
she
wandered
on
with
her
story
he
mentally
felt
himself
actually
dragged
into
the
bedroom
and
standing
an
onlooker
when
the
footman
outside
the
door
did
not
know
where
tonson
had
gone
for
a
moment
he
felt
conscious
of
the
presence
of
some
scent
which
would
have
been
sure
to
exhale
itself
from
draperies
and
wardrobe
he
saw
cook
put
the
account
books
on
the
small
table
he
heard
her
he
also
comprehended
her
and
feather
at
the
window
breathlessly
watching
the
two
cabs
with
the
servants
trunks
on
top
and
the
servants
respectably
unprofessional
in
attire
and
going
away
quietly
without
an
unpractical
compunction
he
saw
these
also
and
comprehended
knowing
exactly
why
compunctions
had
no
part
in
domestic
arrangements
why
should
they
when
feather
reached
the
point
where
it
became
necessary
to
refer
to
robin
some
fortunate
memory
of
alice
past
warnings
caused
her
to
feel
quite
suddenly
that
certain
details
might
be
eliminated
she
cried
a
little
at
first
she
said
but
she
fell
asleep
afterwards
i
was
glad
she
did
because
i
was
afraid
to
go
to
her
in
the
dark
was
she
in
the
dark
i
think
so
perhaps
louisa
taught
her
to
sleep
without
a
light
there
was
none
when
i
took
her
some
condensed
milk
this
morning
there
was
only
milk
to
give
her
she
shed
tears
and
choked
as
she
described
her
journey
into
the
lower
regions
and
the
cockroaches
scuttling
away
before
her
into
their
i
must
have
a
nurse
i
must
have
one
she
almost
sniffed
someone
must
change
her
clothes
and
give
her
a
bath
you
ca
coombe
said
i
dropping
her
handkerchief
how
how
can
i
i
do
know
he
answered
and
picked
up
the
handkerchief
with
an
aloof
grace
of
manner
it
was
really
robin
who
was
for
feather
the
he
thought
she
was
in
danger
of
flinging
herself
upon
him
again
she
caught
at
his
arm
and
her
eyes
of
larkspur
blue
were
actually
wild
do
you
see
where
i
am
how
there
is
nothing
and
nobody
you
see
yes
i
see
he
answered
you
are
quite
right
there
is
nothing
and
nobody
i
have
been
to
lawdor
myself
you
have
been
to
talk
to
him
yesterday
that
was
my
reason
for
coming
here
he
will
not
see
you
or
be
written
to
he
says
he
knows
better
than
to
begin
that
sort
of
thing
it
may
be
that
family
feeling
has
not
the
vogue
it
once
had
but
you
may
recall
that
your
husband
infuriated
him
years
ago
also
england
is
a
less
certain
quantity
than
it
once
was
and
the
man
has
a
family
he
will
allow
you
a
hundred
a
year
but
there
he
draws
the
line
a
hundred
a
year
feather
breathed
from
her
delicate
shoulders
hung
floating
sleeves
of
black
transparency
and
she
lifted
one
of
them
and
held
it
out
like
a
night
moth
wing
this
cost
forty
pounds
she
said
her
voice
quite
faint
and
low
a
good
nurse
would
cost
forty
a
cook
and
a
footman
and
a
maid
and
a
coachman
and
the
brougham
i
do
know
how
much
they
would
cost
she
drooped
forward
upon
her
sofa
and
laid
face
downward
on
a
cushion
slim
exquisite
in
line
lost
in
despair
the
effect
produced
was
that
she
gave
herself
into
his
hands
he
felt
as
well
as
saw
it
and
considered
she
had
no
suggestion
to
offer
no
reserve
there
she
was
it
is
an
incredible
sort
of
situation
he
said
in
an
even
tone
rather
as
if
he
were
thinking
aloud
but
it
is
baldly
real
it
is
actually
simple
in
a
street
in
mayfair
a
woman
and
child
might
he
hesitated
a
second
and
a
wailed
word
came
forth
from
the
cushion
starve
he
moved
slightly
and
continued
since
their
bills
have
not
been
paid
the
will
not
send
in
food
servants
will
not
stay
in
a
house
where
they
are
not
fed
and
receive
no
wages
no
landlord
will
allow
a
tenant
to
occupy
his
property
unless
he
pays
rent
it
may
sound
inhuman
but
it
is
only
human
the
cushion
in
which
feather
face
was
buried
retained
a
faint
scent
of
robert
cigar
smoke
and
the
fragrance
brought
back
to
her
things
she
had
heard
him
say
dispassionately
about
lord
coombe
as
well
as
about
other
men
he
had
not
been
a
puritanic
or
condemnatory
person
she
seemed
to
see
herself
groveling
again
on
the
floor
of
her
bedroom
and
to
feel
the
darkness
and
silence
through
which
she
had
not
dared
to
go
to
robin
not
another
night
like
that
no
no
you
must
go
to
jersey
to
your
mother
and
father
coombe
said
a
hundred
a
year
will
help
you
there
in
your
own
home
then
she
sat
upright
and
there
was
something
in
her
lovely
little
countenance
he
had
never
seen
before
it
was
actually
determination
i
have
heard
she
said
of
poor
girls
who
were
driven
by
starvation
to
to
go
on
the
streets
i
would
go
anywhere
before
i
would
go
back
there
anywhere
he
repeated
his
own
countenance
expressing
or
rather
refusing
to
express
something
as
new
as
the
thing
he
had
seen
in
her
own
anywhere
she
cried
and
then
she
did
what
he
had
thought
her
on
the
verge
of
doing
a
few
minutes
earlier
she
fell
at
his
feet
and
embraced
his
knees
she
clung
to
him
she
sobbed
her
pretty
hair
loosened
itself
and
fell
about
her
in
wild
but
enchanting
disorder
oh
lord
coombe
oh
lord
coombe
oh
lord
coombe
she
cried
as
she
had
cried
in
the
hall
he
rose
and
endeavoured
to
disengage
himself
as
he
had
done
before
this
time
with
less
success
because
she
would
not
let
him
go
he
had
the
greatest
possible
objection
to
scenes
lawless
feather
i
beg
you
will
get
up
he
said
but
she
had
reached
the
point
of
not
caring
what
happened
if
she
could
keep
him
he
was
a
gentleman
he
had
everything
in
the
world
what
did
it
matter
i
have
no
one
but
you
and
and
you
always
seemed
to
like
me
i
would
do
anything
anyone
asked
me
if
they
would
take
care
of
me
i
have
always
liked
you
very
much
and
i
did
amuse
you
did
i
you
liked
to
come
here
there
was
something
poignant
about
her
delicate
distraught
loveliness
and
in
the
remoteness
of
his
being
a
shuddering
knowledge
that
it
was
quite
true
that
she
would
do
anything
for
any
man
who
would
take
care
of
her
produced
an
effect
on
him
nothing
else
would
have
produced
also
a
fantastic
and
finely
ironic
vision
of
joseph
and
potiphar
wife
rose
before
him
and
the
vision
of
himself
as
joseph
irked
a
certain
complexness
of
his
mentality
poignant
as
the
thing
was
in
its
modern
way
it
was
also
faintly
ridiculous
then
robin
awakened
and
shrieked
again
the
sound
which
had
gained
strength
through
long
sleep
and
also
through
added
discomfort
quite
rang
through
the
house
what
that
sound
added
to
the
moment
he
himself
would
not
have
been
able
to
explain
until
long
afterwards
but
it
singularly
and
impellingly
added
listen
panted
feather
she
has
begun
again
and
there
is
no
one
to
go
to
her
get
up
lawless
he
said
do
i
understand
that
you
are
willing
that
arrange
this
for
you
he
helped
her
to
her
feet
do
you
mean
really
she
faltered
will
you
will
you
her
uplifted
eyes
were
like
a
young
angel
brimming
with
crystal
drops
which
slipped
as
a
child
tears
slip
down
her
cheeks
she
clasped
her
hands
in
exquisite
appeal
he
stood
for
a
moment
quite
still
his
mind
fled
far
away
and
he
forgot
where
he
was
and
because
of
this
the
little
simpleton
shallow
discretion
deserted
her
if
you
were
a
a
marrying
man
she
said
foolishly
almost
in
a
whisper
he
recovered
himself
i
am
not
with
a
finality
which
cut
as
cleanly
as
a
surgical
knife
something
which
was
not
the
words
was
of
a
succinctness
which
filled
her
with
new
terror
i
i
know
she
whimpered
i
only
said
if
you
were
if
i
were
in
this
instance
it
would
make
no
difference
he
saw
the
kind
of
slippery
silliness
he
was
dealing
with
and
what
it
might
transform
itself
into
if
allowed
a
loophole
there
must
be
no
mistakes
in
her
fright
she
saw
him
for
a
moment
more
distinctly
than
she
had
ever
seen
him
before
and
hideous
dread
beset
her
lest
she
had
blundered
fatally
there
shall
be
none
she
gasped
i
always
knew
there
shall
be
none
at
all
do
you
know
what
you
are
asking
me
he
inquired
yes
yes
i
not
a
girl
you
know
i
been
married
i
go
home
i
ca
starve
or
live
in
awful
lodgings
somebody
must
save
me
do
you
know
what
people
will
say
his
steady
voice
was
slightly
lower
it
wo
be
said
to
me
rather
wildly
nobody
minds
really
he
ceased
altogether
to
look
serious
he
smiled
with
the
light
detached
air
his
world
was
most
familiar
with
no
they
do
really
he
answered
i
had
however
a
slight
preference
for
knowing
whether
you
would
or
not
you
flatter
me
by
intimating
that
you
would
not
he
knew
that
if
he
had
held
out
an
arm
she
would
have
fallen
upon
his
breast
and
wept
there
but
he
was
not
at
the
moment
in
the
mood
to
hold
out
an
arm
he
merely
touched
hers
with
a
light
pressure
let
us
sit
down
and
talk
it
over
he
suggested
a
hansom
drove
up
to
the
door
and
stopped
before
he
had
time
to
seat
himself
hearing
it
he
went
to
the
window
and
saw
a
stout
businesslike
looking
man
get
out
accompanied
by
an
attendant
there
followed
a
loud
authoritative
ringing
of
the
bell
and
an
equally
authoritative
rap
of
the
knocker
this
repeated
itself
feather
who
had
run
to
the
window
and
caught
sight
of
the
stout
man
clutched
his
sleeve
it
the
agent
we
took
the
house
from
we
always
said
we
were
out
it
either
carson
or
bayle
i
do
know
which
coombe
walked
toward
the
staircase
you
ca
open
the
door
she
shrilled
he
has
doubtless
come
prepared
to
open
it
himself
he
answered
and
proceeded
at
leisure
down
the
narrow
stairway
the
caller
had
come
prepared
by
the
time
coombe
stood
in
the
hall
a
latchkey
was
put
in
the
keyhole
and
being
turned
the
door
opened
to
let
in
carson
or
bayle
who
entered
with
an
air
of
angered
determination
followed
by
his
young
man
the
physical
presence
of
the
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
was
always
described
as
a
subtly
impressive
one
several
centuries
of
rather
careful
breeding
had
resulted
in
his
seeming
to
represent
things
by
silent
implication
a
man
who
has
never
found
the
necessity
of
explaining
or
excusing
himself
inevitably
presents
a
front
wholly
unsuggestive
of
uncertainty
the
front
coombe
presented
merely
awaited
explanations
from
others
carson
or
bayle
had
doubtless
contemplated
seeing
a
frightened
servant
trying
to
prepare
a
stammering
obvious
lie
he
confronted
a
tall
thin
man
about
whom
even
if
his
clothes
had
been
totally
different
there
could
be
no
mistake
he
stood
awaiting
an
apology
so
evidently
that
carson
or
bayle
began
to
stammer
himself
even
before
he
had
time
to
dismiss
from
his
voice
the
suggestion
of
bluster
it
would
have
irritated
coombe
immensely
if
he
had
known
that
he
and
a
certain
overcoat
had
been
once
pointed
out
to
the
man
at
sandown
and
that
in
consequence
of
the
overcoat
he
vaguely
recognized
him
i
i
beg
pardon
he
began
quite
so
said
coombe
some
tenants
came
to
look
at
the
house
this
morning
they
had
an
order
to
view
from
us
they
were
sent
away
my
lord
and
decline
to
come
back
the
rent
has
not
been
paid
since
the
first
half
year
there
is
no
one
now
who
can
even
pretend
it
going
to
be
paid
some
step
had
to
be
taken
quite
so
said
coombe
suppose
you
step
into
the
he
led
the
pair
into
the
room
and
pointed
to
chairs
but
neither
the
agent
nor
his
attendant
was
calm
enough
to
sit
down
coombe
merely
stood
and
explained
himself
i
quite
understand
he
said
you
are
entirely
within
your
rights
is
naturally
not
able
to
attend
to
business
for
the
present
as
a
friend
of
her
late
husband
i
will
arrange
matters
for
her
i
am
lord
coombe
she
does
not
wish
to
give
up
the
house
do
send
any
more
possible
tenants
call
at
coombe
house
in
an
hour
and
i
will
give
you
a
cheque
there
were
a
few
awkward
apologetic
moments
and
then
the
front
door
opened
and
shut
the
hansom
jingled
away
and
coombe
returned
to
the
robin
was
still
shrieking
she
wants
some
more
condensed
milk
he
said
do
be
frightened
go
and
give
her
some
i
know
an
elderly
woman
who
understands
children
she
was
a
nurse
some
years
ago
i
will
send
her
here
at
once
kindly
give
me
the
account
books
my
housekeeper
will
send
you
some
servants
the
will
come
for
orders
feather
was
staring
at
him
they
she
stammered
everything
yes
everything
he
answered
do
be
frightened
go
upstairs
and
try
to
stop
her
i
must
go
now
i
never
heard
a
creature
yell
with
such
fury
she
turned
away
and
went
towards
the
second
flight
of
stairs
with
a
rather
dazed
air
she
had
passed
through
a
rather
tremendous
crisis
and
she
was
dazed
he
made
her
feel
so
she
had
never
understood
him
for
a
moment
and
she
did
not
understand
him
now
but
then
she
never
did
understand
people
and
the
whole
situation
was
a
new
one
to
her
if
she
had
not
been
driven
to
the
wall
she
would
have
been
quite
as
respectable
as
she
knew
how
to
be
coombe
called
a
hansom
and
drove
home
thinking
of
many
things
and
looking
even
more
than
usually
detached
he
had
remarked
the
facial
expression
of
the
short
and
stout
man
as
he
had
got
into
his
cab
and
he
was
turning
over
mentally
his
own
exact
knowledge
of
the
views
the
business
mind
would
have
held
and
what
the
business
countenance
would
have
decently
covered
if
he
coombe
had
explained
in
detail
that
he
was
so
far
in
this
particular
case
an
entirely
blameless
character
chapter
vii
the
slice
of
a
house
from
that
time
forward
presented
the
external
aspect
to
which
the
inhabitants
of
the
narrow
and
fashionable
street
and
those
who
passed
through
it
had
been
accustomed
such
individuals
as
had
anticipated
beholding
at
some
early
day
notices
conspicuously
placed
announcing
sale
by
auction
elegant
modern
furniture
were
vaguely
puzzled
as
well
as
surprised
by
the
fact
that
no
such
notices
appeared
even
inconspicuously
also
there
did
not
draw
up
before
the
door
even
as
the
weeks
went
on

and
heavy

their
resultant

note

admirable

fresh
flowers

even
more
correct

to
be
seen

appeared
promptly
every
day
and
were
obsequiously
respectful
in
manner
evidently
the
household
had
not
disintegrated
as
a
result
of
the
death
of
as
it
became
an
established
fact
that
the
household
had
not
fallen
to
pieces
its
frequenters
gradually
returned
to
it
wearing
indeed
the
air
of
people
who
had
never
really
remained
away
from
it
there
had
been
natural
reasons
enough
for
considerate
absence
from
a
house
of
bereavement
and
a
desolate
widow
upon
whose
grief
it
would
have
been
indelicate
to
intrude
as
feather
herself
had
realized
the
circle
of
her
intimates
was
not
formed
of
those
who
could
readily
adjust
themselves
to
entirely
changed
circumstances
if
you
dance
on
a
tight
rope
and
the
rope
is
unexpectedly
withdrawn
where
are
you
you
can
not
continue
dancing
until
the
rope
is
restrung
the
rope
however
being
apparently
made
absolutely
secure
it
was
not
long
before
the
dancing
began
again
feather

shading
itself

the

madame
helene
treated
her
as
a
star
gleaming
through
gradually
dispersing
clouds
her
circle
watched
her
with
secretly
humorous
interest
as
each
fine
veil
of
dimness
was
withdrawn
the
things
she
wears
are
priceless

said
amiably
in
her

where

a
long
thin
young
man
with
a
rather
narrow
face
and
dark
eyes
peering
through
pince
nez
but
i
could
in
places
where
entertainment
as
a
means
of
existence
proceed
so
to
speak
fast
and
furiously
questions
of
taste
are
not
dwelt
upon
at
leisure
you
need
not
hesitate
before
saying
anything
you
liked
in
any
one
so
long
as
it
was
amusing
enough
to
make
somebody
if
not
everybody
laugh
feather
had
made
people
laugh
in
the
same
fashion
in
the
past
the
persons
she
most
admired
were
always
making
sly
little
impudent
comments
and
suggestions
and
the
thwarted
years
on
the
island
of
jersey
had
in
her
case
resulted
in
an
almost
hectic
desire
to
keep
pace
her
efforts
had
usually
been
successes
because
nature
self
had
provided
her
with
the
manner
of
a
silly
pretty
child
who
did
not
know
how
far
she
went
shouts
of
laughter
had
often
greeted
her
and
the
first
time
she
had
for
a
moment
doubted
her
prowess
was
on
an
occasion
when
she
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
coombe
who
stared
at
her
with
an
expression
which
she
would
just
for
one
second
have
felt
might
be
horror
if
she
had
not
been
so
sure
it
could
be
and
must
of
course
be
something
else
one
of
the
things
nobody
ever
understood
in
him
by
the
time
the
softly
swathing
veils
of
vaporous
darkness
were
withdrawn
and
the
tight
rope
assuring
everyone
of
its
permanent
security
became
a
trusted
support
feather
at
her
crowded
little
parties
and
at
other
people
bigger
ones
did
not
remain
wholly
unaware
of
the
probability
that
even
people
who
rather
liked
her
made
among
themselves
more
or
less
witty
comments
upon
her
improved
fortunes
they
were
improved
greatly
bills
were
paid
were
polite
servants
were
respectful
she
had
no
need
to
invent
excuses
and
lies
she
and
robert
had
always
kept
out
of
the
way
of
stodgy
critical
people
so
they
had
been
intimate
with
none
of
the
punctilious
who
might
have
withdrawn
themselves
from
a
condition
of
things
they
chose
to
disapprove
accordingly
she
found
no
gaps
in
her
circle
those
who
had
formed
the
habit
of
amusing
themselves
at
her
house
were
as
ready
as
before
to
amuse
themselves
again
the
fact
remained
however
curiously
perhaps
in
connection
with
the
usual
slightness
of
all
impressions
made
on
her
that
there
was
a
memory
which
never
wholly
left
her
even
when
she
tried
to
force
it
so
far
into
the
background
of
her
existence
that
it
might
almost
be
counted
as
forgotten
it
had
a
trick
of
rising
before
her
it
was
the
memory
of
the
empty
house
as
its
emptiness
had
struck
to
the
centre
of
her
being
when
she
had
turned
from
her
bedroom
window
after
watching
the
servants
drive
away
in
their
cabs
it
was
also
the
memory
of
the
hours
which
had
followed
the
night
in
which
nobody
had
been
in
any
of
the
rooms
no
one
had
gone
up
or
down
the
stairs
when
all
had
seemed
dark
and
hollow
except
the
night
nursery
where
robin
screamed
and
her
own
room
where
she
herself
cowered
under
the
bed
clothes
and
pulled
the
pillow
over
her
head
but
though
the
picture
would
not
let
itself
be
blotted
out
its
effect
was
rather
to
intensify
her
sense
of
relief
because
she
had
slipped
so
safely
from
under
the
wheels
of
destiny
sometimes
she
revealed
artlessly
to
coombe
while
i
am
driving
in
the
park
on
a
fine
afternoon
when
every
one
is
out
and
the
dresses
look
like
the
flower
beds
i
let
myself
remember
it
just
to
make
myself
enjoy
everything
more
by
contrast
the
elderly
woman
who
had
been
a
nurse
in
her
youth
and
who
had
been
sent
by
lord
coombe
temporarily
to
replace
louisa
had
not
remained
long
in
charge
of
robin
she
was
not
young
and
smart
enough
for
a
house
on
the
right
side
of
the
right
street
and
feather
found
a
young
person
who
looked
exactly
as
she
should
when
she
pushed
the
child
carriage
before
her
around
the
square
the
square
out
of
which
the
right
street
branches
and
the
gardens
in
the
middle
of
the
square
to
which
only
privileged
persons
were
admitted
by
private
key
the
basement
kitchen
and
servants
hall
and
the
two
top
floor
nurseries
represented
the
world
to
the
child
robin
for
some
years
when
she
was
old
enough
to
walk
in
the
street
she
was
led
by
the
hand
over
the
ground
she
had
travelled
daily
in
her
baby
carriage
her
first
memory
of
things
was
a
memory
of
standing
on
the
gravel
path
in
the
square
gardens
and
watching
some
sparrows
quarrel
while
andrews
her
nurse
sat
on
a
bench
with
another
nurse
and
talked
in
low
tones
they
were
talking
in
a
way
robin
always
connected
with
servants
and
which
she
naturally
accepted
as
being
the
method
of
expression
of
their
species
much
as
she
accepted
the
mewing
of
cats
and
the
barking
of
dogs
as
she
grew
older
she
reached
the
stage
of
knowing
that
they
were
generally
saying
things
they
did
not
wish
her
to
hear
she
liked
watching
the
sparrows
in
the
gardens
because
she
liked
watching
sparrows
at
all
times
they
were
the
only
friends
she
had
ever
known
though
she
was
not
old
enough
to
call
them
friends
or
to
know
what
friends
meant
andrews
had
taught
her
by
means
of
a
system
of
her
own
to
know
better
than
to
cry
or
to
make
any
protesting
noise
when
she
was
left
alone
in
her
ugly
small
nursery
andrews
idea
of
her
duties
did
not
involve
boring
herself
to
death
by
sitting
in
a
room
on
the
top
floor
when
livelier
entertainment
awaited
her
in
the
basement
where
the
cook
was
a
woman
of
wide
experience
the
housemaid
a
young
person
who
had
lived
in
gay
country
houses
and
the
footman
at
once
a
young
man
of
spirit
and
humour
so
robin
spent
many
hours
of
the
day
taking
them
altogether
quite
by
herself
she
might
have
more
potently
resented
her
isolations
if
she
had
ever
known
any
other
condition
than
that
of
a
child
in
whom
no
one
was
in
the
least
interested
and
in
whom
being
good
could
only
mean
being
passive
under
neglect
and
calling
no
one
attention
to
the
fact
that
she
wanted
anything
from
anybody
as
a
bird
born
in
captivity
lives
in
its
cage
and
perhaps
believes
it
to
be
the
world
robin
lived
in
her
nursery
and
knew
every
square
inch
of
it
with
a
deadly
if
unconscious
sense
of
distaste
and
fatigue
she
was
put
to
bed
and
taken
up
she
was
fed
and
dressed
in
it
and
once
a
day
twice
perhaps
if
andrews
chose
she
was
taken
out
of
it
downstairs
and
into
the
street
that
was
all
and
that
was
why
she
liked
the
sparrows
so
much
and
sparrows
are
worth
watching
if
you
live
in
a
nursery
where
nothing
ever
happens
and
where
when
you
look
out
you
are
so
high
up
that
it
is
not
easy
to
see
the
people
in
the
world
below
in
addition
to
which
it
seems
nearly
always
raining
robin
used
to
watch
them
hopping
about
on
the
slate
roofs
of
the
homes
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
they
fluttered
their
wings
they
picked
up
straws
and
carried
them
away
she
thought
they
must
have
houses
of
their
own
among
the
chimneys
in
places
she
could
not
see
she
fancied
it
would
be
nice
to
hop
about
on
the
top
of
a
roof
oneself
if
one
were
not
at
all
afraid
of
falling
she
liked
the
chippering
and
chirping
sounds
the
birds
made
became
it
sounded
like
talking
and
laughing
like
the
talking
and
laughing
she
sometimes
wakened
out
of
her
sleep
to
lie
and
listen
to
when
the
lady
downstairs
had
a
party
she
often
wondered
what
the
people
were
doing
because
it
sounded
as
if
they
liked
doing
it
very
much
sometimes
when
it
had
rained
two
or
three
days
she
had
a
feeling
which
made
her
begin
to
cry
to
herself
but
not
aloud
she
had
once
had
a
little
black
and
blue
mark
on
her
arm
for
a
week
where
andrews
had
pinched
her
because
she
had
cried
loud
enough
to
be
heard
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
andrews
twisted
and
pinched
the
bit
of
flesh
for
five
minutes
without
letting
it
go
and
she
had
held
her
large
hand
over
her
mouth
as
she
did
it
now
you
keep
that
in
your
mind
she
had
said
when
she
had
finished
and
robin
had
almost
choked
in
her
awful
little
struggle
to
keep
back
all
sound
the
one
thing
andrews
was
surest
of
was
that
nobody
would
come
upstairs
to
the
nursery
to
inquire
the
meaning
of
any
cries
which
were
not
unearthly
enough
to
disturb
the
household
so
it
was
easy
to
regulate
the
existence
of
her
charge
in
such
a
manner
as
best
suited
herself
just
give
her
food
enough
and
keep
her
from
making
silly
noises
when
she
wants
what
she
does
get
said
andrews
to
her
companions
below
stairs
that
one
in
the
is
going
to
interfere
with
the
nursery
not
her
i
know
my
business
and
i
know
how
to
manage
her
kind
i
go
to
her
politely
now
and
then
and
ask
her
permission
to
buy
things
from
best
or
liberty
or
some
other
good
place
she
always
stares
a
minute
when
i
begin
as
if
she
scarcely
understood
what
i
was
talking
about
and
then
she
says
yes
i
suppose
she
must
have
them
and
i
go
and
get
them
i
keep
her
as
well
dressed
as
any
child
in
mayfair
and
she
been
a
beauty
since
she
was
a
year
old
so
she
looks
first
rate
when
i
wheel
her
up
and
down
the
street
so
the
people
can
see
she
well
taken
care
of
and
not
kept
hidden
away
no
one
can
complain
of
her
looks
and
nobody
is
bothered
with
her
that
all
that
wanted
of
me
i
get
good
wages
and
i
get
them
regular
i
do
turn
up
my
nose
at
a
place
like
this
whatever
the
outside
talk
is
who
cares
in
these
days
anyway
fashionable
people
broader
minded
than
they
used
to
be
in
queen
victoria
young
days
they
tell
me
servants
were
no
class
that
did
live
in
families
where
they
kept
the
commandments
fat
lot
the
commandments
give
any
one
trouble
in
these
times
said
jennings
the
footman
who
was
a
wit
there
one
of
i
could
mention
that
been
broken
till
there
no
bits
of
it
left
to
keep
if
i
smashed
that
plate
until
it
was
powder
it
have
to
be
swept
into
the
dust
din
that
what
happened
to
one
or
two
commandments
in
particular
well
remarked
blayne
the
cook
she
do
interfere
and
he
pays
the
bills
prompt
that
do
me
instead
of
commandments
if
you
believe
me
my
mother
told
me
that
in
them
queen
victoria
days
ladies
used
to
inquire
about
cold
meat
and
ask
what
was
done
with
the
dripping
civilisation
gone
beyond
that
commandments
or
no
commandments
he
precious
particular
about
bills
being
paid
volunteered
jennings
with
the
air
of
a
man
of
the
world
i
heard
him
having
a
row
with
her
one
day
about
some
bills
she
had
paid
spent
the
money
for
some
nonsense
and
he
was
pretty
stiff
in
that
queer
way
of
his
quite
right
he
was
too
i
have
been
the
same
myself
pulling
up
his
collar
and
stretching
his
neck
in
a
manner
indicating
exact
knowledge
of
the
natural
sentiments
of
a
marquis
when
justly
annoyed
what
he
intimated
was
that
if
them
bills
was
not
paid
with
the
money
that
was
meant
to
pay
them
the
money
would
be
forthcoming
the
next
time
jennings
was
rather
pleased
by
the
word
forthcoming
and
therefore
he
repeated
it
with
emphasis
it
would
be
forthcoming
that
frighten
her
was
andrews
succinct
observation
it
did
said
jennings
she
have
gone
in
hysterics
if
he
kept
her
down
he
got
a
way
with
him
coombe
has
andrews
laughed
a
brief
dry
laugh
do
you
know
what
the
child
calls
her
she
said
she
calls
her
the
lady
downstairs
she
got
a
sort
of
fancy
for
her
and
tries
to
get
peeps
at
her
when
we
go
out
i
notice
she
always
cranes
her
little
neck
if
we
pass
a
room
she
might
chance
to
be
in
her
pretty
clothes
and
her
laughing
that
does
it
children
drawn
by
bright
colours
and
noise
that
sounds
merry
it
my
belief
the
child
does
know
she
is
her
mother
said
blayne
as
she
opened
an
oven
door
to
look
at
some
rolls
it
my
belief
that
if
i
told
her
she
was
she
would
know
what
the
word
meant
it
was
me
she
got
the
name
from
andrews
still
laughed
as
she
explained
i
used
to
tell
her
about
the
lady
downstairs
would
hear
if
she
made
a
noise
or
i
say
i
let
her
have
a
peep
at
the
lady
downstairs
if
she
was
very
good
i
saw
she
had
a
kind
of
awe
of
her
though
she
liked
her
so
much
so
it
was
a
good
way
of
managing
her
you
may
believe
me
but
for
a
good
bit
i
did
take
in
that
she
did
know
there
was
such
things
as
mothers
and
when
i
did
take
it
in
i
saw
there
any
use
in
trying
to
explain
she
would
have
understood
how
would
you
go
about
to
explain
a
mother
anyway
suggested
jennings
i
have
to
say
that
she
was
the
person
that
had
the
right
to
slap
your
head
if
you
did
do
what
she
told
you
i
have
to
say
that
she
was
the
woman
that
could
keep
you
slaving
at
kitchen
maid
work
fifteen
hours
a
day
said
blayne
my
mother
was
cook
in
a
big
house
and
trained
me
under
her
i
never
had
one
said
andrews
stiffly
the
truth
was
that
she
had
taken
care
of
eight
infant
brothers
and
sisters
while
her
maternal
parent
slept
raucously
under
the
influence
of
beer
when
she
was
not
quarrelling
with
her
offspring
jane
the
housemaid
had
passed
a
not
uncomfortable
childhood
in
the
country
and
was
perhaps
of
a
soft
nature
i
say
that
a
mother
the
one
that
you
belong
to
and
fond
of
you
even
if
she
does
keep
you
straight
she
put
in
her
mother
is
fond
of
her
and
does
keep
herself
straight
said
jennings
so
that
would
do
and
she
does
slap
her
head
or
teach
her
to
do
kitchen
work
put
in
blayne
so
yours
is
no
use
jennings
and
neither
is
mine
miss
andrews
have
to
cook
up
an
explanation
of
her
own
herself
when
she
finds
she
has
to
she
can
get
it
out
of
a
drury
lane
melodrama
said
jennings
with
great
humour
you
have
to
sit
down
some
night
miss
andrews
and
say
time
has
come
me
when
i
must
tell
you
all
in
this
manner
were
and
her
maternal
affections
discussed
below
stairs
the
interesting
fact
remained
that
to
robin
the
lady
downstairs
was
merely
a
radiant
and
beautiful
being
who
floated
through
certain
rooms
laughing
or
chattering
like
a
bird
and
always
wearing
pretty
clothes
which
were
different
each
time
one
beheld
her
sometimes
one
might
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
through
a
door
or
if
one
pressed
one
face
against
the
window
pane
at
the
right
moment
she
might
get
into
her
bright
little
carnage
in
the
street
below
and
after
jennings
had
shut
its
door
she
might
be
seen
to
give
a
lovely
flutter
to
her
clothes
as
she
settled
back
against
the
richly
dark
blue
cushions
it
is
a
somewhat
portentous
thing
to
realize
that
a
newborn
human
creature
can
only
know
what
it
is
taught
the
teaching
may
be
conscious
or
unconscious
intelligent
or
idiotic
exquisite
or
brutal
the
images
presented
by
those
surrounding
it
as
its
perceptions
awaken
day
by
day
are
those
which
record
themselves
on
its
soul
its
brain
its
physical
being
which
is
its
sole
means
of
expressing
during
physical
life
all
it
has
learned
that
which
automatically
becomes
the
law
at
the
dawning
of
newborn
consciousness
remains
to
its
understanding
the
law
of
being
the
law
of
the
universe
to
the
cautious
of
responsibility
this
at
times
wears
the
aspect
of
an
awesome
thing
suggesting
however
remotely
that
it
might
seem
well
perhaps
to
remove
the
shoes
from
one
feet
as
it
were
and
tread
with
deliberate
and
delicate
considering
of
one
steps
as
do
the
reverently
courteous
even
on
the
approaching
of
an
unknown
altar
this
being
acknowledged
a
scientific
as
well
as
a
spiritual
truth
there
remains
no
mystery
in
the
fact
that
robin
at
six
years
old
when
she
watched
the
sparrows
in
the
square
gardens
did
not
know
the
name
of
the
feeling
which
had
grown
within
her
as
a
result
of
her
pleasure
in
the
chance
glimpses
of
the
lady
downstairs
it
was
a
feeling
which
made
her
eager
to
see
her
or
anything
which
belonged
to
her
it
made
her
strain
her
child
ears
to
catch
the
sound
of
her
voice
it
made
her
long
to
hear
andrews
or
the
other
servants
speak
of
her
and
yet
much
too
shy
to
dare
to
ask
any
questions
she
had
found
a
place
on
the
staircase
leading
to
the
nursery
where
by
squeezing
against
the
balustrade
she
could
sometimes
see
the
lady
pass
in
and
out
of
her
pink
bedroom
she
used
to
sit
on
a
step
and
peer
between
the
railing
with
beating
heart
sometimes
after
she
had
been
put
to
bed
for
the
night
and
andrews
was
safely
entertained
downstairs
robin
would
be
awakened
from
her
first
sleep
by
sounds
in
the
room
below
and
would
creep
out
of
bed
and
down
to
her
special
step
and
crouching
in
a
hectic
joy
would
see
the
lady
come
out
with
sparkling
things
in
her
hair
and
round
her
lovely
very
bare
white
neck
and
arms
all
swathed
in
tints
and
draperies
which
made
her
seem
a
vision
of
colour
and
light
she
was
so
radiant
a
thing
that
often
the
child
drew
in
her
breath
with
a
sound
like
a
little
sob
of
ecstasy
and
her
lip
trembled
as
if
she
were
going
to
cry
but
she
did
not
know
that
what
she
felt
was
the
yearning
of
a
thing
called
love
a
quite
simple
and
natural
common
thing
of
which
she
had
no
reason
for
having
any
personal
knowledge
as
she
was
unaware
of
mothers
so
she
was
unaware
of
affection
of
which
andrews
would
have
felt
it
to
be
superfluously
sentimental
to
talk
to
her
on
the
very
rare
occasions
when
the
lady
downstairs
appeared
on
the
threshold
of
the
day
nursery
robin
always
having
been
freshly
dressed
in
one
of
her
nicest
frocks
stood
and
stared
with
immense
startled
eyes
and
answered
in
a
whisper
the
banal
little
questions
put
to
her
the
lady
appeared
at
such
rare
intervals
and
remained
poised
upon
the
threshold
like
a
tropic
plumaged
bird
for
moments
so
brief
that
there
never
was
time
to
do
more
than
lose
breath
and
gaze
as
at
a
sudden
vision
why
she
came
when
she
did
come
robin
did
not
understand
she
evidently
did
not
belong
to
the
small
dingy
nurseries
which
grew
shabbier
every
year
as
they
grew
steadily
more
grimy
under
the
persistent
london
soot
and
fogs
feather
always
held
up
her
draperies
when
she
came
she
would
not
have
come
at
all
but
for
the
fact
that
she
had
once
or
twice
been
asked
if
the
child
was
growing
pretty
and
it
would
have
seemed
absurd
to
admit
that
she
never
saw
her
at
all
i
think
she
rather
pretty
she
said
downstairs
she
round
and
she
has
a
bright
colour
almost
too
bright
and
her
eyes
are
round
too
she
either
rather
stupid
or
she
shy
and
one
as
bad
as
the
other
she
a
child
that
stares
if
when
andrews
had
taken
her
into
the
gardens
she
had
played
with
other
children
robin
would
no
doubt
have
learned
something
of
the
existence
and
normal
attitude
of
mothers
through
the
mere
accident
of
childish
chatter
but
it
somehow
happened
that
she
never
formed
relations
with
the
charges
of
other
nurses
she
took
it
for
granted
for
some
time
that
this
was
because
andrews
had
laid
down
some
mysterious
law
andrews
did
not
seem
to
form
acquaintances
herself
sometimes
she
sat
on
a
bench
and
talked
a
little
to
another
nurse
but
she
seldom
sat
twice
with
the
same
person
it
was
indeed
generally
her
custom
to
sit
alone
crocheting
or
sewing
with
a
rather
lofty
and
exclusive
air
and
to
call
robin
back
to
her
side
if
she
saw
her
slowly
edging
towards
some
other
child
my
rule
is
to
keep
myself
to
myself
she
said
in
the
kitchen
and
to
look
as
if
i
was
the
one
that
would
turn
up
noses
if
noses
was
to
be
turned
up
there
those
that
would
snatch
away
their
children
if
i
let
robin
begin
to
make
up
to
them
some
would
of
course
but
i
not
going
to
run
risks
i
going
to
save
my
own
pride
but
one
morning
when
robin
was
watching
her
sparrows
a
nurse
who
was
an
old
acquaintance
surprised
andrews
by
appearing
in
the
gardens
with
two
little
girls
in
her
charge
they
were
children
of
nine
and
eleven
and
quite
sufficient
for
themselves
apart
from
the
fact
that
they
regarded
robin
as
a
baby
and
therefore
took
no
notice
of
her
they
began
playing
with
skipping
ropes
which
left
their
nurse
free
to
engage
in
delighted
conversation
with
andrews
it
was
conversation
so
delightful
that
robin
was
forgotten
even
to
the
extent
of
being
allowed
to
follow
her
sparrows
round
a
clump
of
shrubbery
and
therefore
out
of
andrews
sight
though
she
was
only
a
few
yards
away
the
sparrows
this
morning
were
quarrelsome
and
suddenly
engaged
in
a
fight
pecking
each
other
furiously
beating
their
wings
and
uttering
shrill
protesting
chipperings
robin
did
not
quite
understand
what
they
were
doing
and
stood
watching
them
with
spellbound
interest
it
was
while
she
watched
them
that
she
heard
footsteps
on
the
gravel
walk
which
stopped
near
her
and
made
her
look
up
to
see
who
was
at
her
side
a
big
boy
in
highland
kilts
and
bonnet
and
sporan
was
standing
by
her
and
she
found
herself
staring
into
a
pair
of
handsome
deep
blue
eyes
blue
like
the
waters
of
a
hillside
tarn
they
were
wide
glowing
friendly
eyes
and
none
like
them
had
ever
looked
into
hers
before
he
seemed
to
her
to
be
a
very
big
boy
indeed
and
in
fact
he
was
unusually
tall
and
broad
for
his
age
but
he
was
only
eight
years
old
and
a
simple
enough
child
pagan
robin
heart
began
to
beat
as
it
did
when
she
watched
the
lady
downstairs
but
there
was
something
different
in
the
beating
it
was
something
which
made
her
red
mouth
spread
and
curve
itself
into
a
smile
which
showed
all
her
small
teeth
so
they
stood
and
stared
at
each
other
and
for
some
strange
strange
reason
created
perhaps
with
the
creating
of
man
and
still
hidden
among
the
deep
secrets
of
the
universe
they
were
drawn
to
each
other
wanted
each
other
knew
each
other
their
advances
were
of
course
of
the
most
primitive
as
primitive
and
as
much
a
matter
of
instinct
as
the
nosing
and
sniffing
of
young
animals
he
spread
and
curved
his
red
mouth
and
showed
the
healthy
whiteness
of
his
own
handsome
teeth
as
she
had
shown
her
smaller
ones
then
he
began
to
run
and
prance
round
in
a
circle
capering
like
a
shetland
pony
to
exhibit
at
once
his
friendliness
and
his
prowess
he
tossed
his
curled
head
and
laughed
to
make
her
laugh
also
and
she
not
only
laughed
but
clapped
her
hands
he
was
more
beautiful
than
anything
she
had
ever
seen
before
in
her
life
and
he
was
plainly
trying
to
please
her
no
child
creature
had
ever
done
anything
like
it
before
because
no
child
creature
had
ever
been
allowed
by
andrews
to
make
friends
with
her
he
on
his
part
was
only
doing
what
any
other
little
boy
animal
would
have
done
expressing
his
child
masculinity
by
showing
off
before
a
little
female
but
to
this
little
female
it
had
never
happened
before
it
was
all
beautifully
elemental
as
does
not
too
often
happen
two
souls
as
well
as
two
bodies
were
drawn
towards
each
other
by
the
magnet
of
being
when
he
had
exhibited
himself
for
a
minute
or
two
he
came
back
to
her
breathing
fast
and
glowing
my
pony
in
scotland
does
that
his
name
is
chieftain
he
is
a
shetland
pony
and
he
is
only
that
high
he
measured
forty
inches
from
the
ground
i
called
donal
what
are
you
called
robin
she
answered
her
lips
and
voice
trembling
with
joy
he
was
so
beautiful
his
hair
was
bright
and
curly
his
broad
forehead
was
clear
white
where
he
had
pushed
back
his
bonnet
with
the
eagle
feather
standing
upright
on
it
his
strong
legs
and
knees
were
white
between
his
tartan
kilt
and
his
rolled
back
stockings
the
clasps
which
held
his
feather
and
the
plaid
over
his
shoulder
were
set
with
fine
stones
in
rich
silver
she
did
not
know
that
he
was
perfectly
equipped
as
a
little
highland
chieftain
the
head
of
his
clan
should
be
they
began
to
play
together
and
the
unknown
fates
which
do
their
work
as
they
choose
so
wrought
on
this
occasion
as
to
cause
andrews
friend
to
set
forth
upon
a
journey
through
a
story
so
exciting
in
its
nature
that
its
hearer
was
held
spellbound
and
oblivious
to
her
surroundings
themselves
once
it
is
true
she
rose
as
in
a
dream
and
walked
round
the
group
of
shrubs
but
the
fates
had
arranged
for
that
moment
also
robin
was
alone
and
was
busily
playing
with
some
leaves
she
had
plucked
and
laid
on
the
seat
of
a
bench
for
some
mysterious
reason
she
looked
good
for
an
hour
safe
occupation
and
andrews
returned
to
her
detailed
and
intimate
version
of
a
great
country
house
scandal
of
which
the
papers
were
full
because
it
had
ended
in
the
divorce
court
donal
had
at
that
special
moment
gone
to
pick
some
of
the
biggest
leaves
from
the
lilac
bush
of
which
the
gardens
contained
numerous
sooty
specimens
the
leaves
robin
was
playing
with
were
some
he
had
plucked
first
to
show
her
a
wonderful
thing
if
you
laid
a
leaf
flat
on
the
seat
of
the
bench
and
were
fortunate
enough
to
possess
a
large
pin
you
could
prick
beautiful
patterns
on
the
greenness
dots
and
circles
and
borders
and
tiny
triangles
of
a
most
decorative
order
neither
donal
nor
robin
had
a
pin
but
donal
had
in
his
rolled
down
stocking
a
little
dirk
the
point
of
which
could
apparently
be
used
for
any
interesting
purpose
it
was
really
he
who
did
the
decoration
but
robin
leaned
against
the
bench
and
looked
on
enthralled
she
had
never
been
happy
before
in
the
entire
course
of
her
brief
existence
she
had
not
known
or
expected
any
conditions
other
than
those
she
was
familiar
with
the
conditions
of
being
fed
and
clothed
kept
clean
and
exercised
but
totally
unloved
and
unentertained
she
did
not
even
know
that
this
nearness
to
another
human
creature
the
exchange
of
companionable
looks
which
were
like
flashes
of
sunlight
the
mutual
outbreaks
of
child
laughter
and
pleasure
were
happiness
to
her
what
she
felt
the
glow
and
delight
of
it
had
no
name
but
she
wanted
it
to
go
on
and
on
never
to
be
put
an
end
to
by
andrews
or
anyone
else
the
boy
donal
was
not
so
unconscious
he
had
been
happy
all
his
life
what
he
felt
was
that
he
had
liked
this
little
girl
the
minute
he
saw
her
she
was
pretty
though
he
thought
her
immensely
younger
than
himself
and
when
she
had
looked
up
at
him
with
her
round
asking
eyes
he
had
wanted
to
talk
to
her
and
make
friends
he
had
not
played
much
with
boys
and
he
had
no
haughty
objection
to
girls
who
liked
him
this
one
did
he
saw
at
once
through
what
means
children
so
quickly
convey
to
each
other
while
seeming
scarcely
to
do
more
than
play
the
entire
history
of
their
lives
and
surroundings
is
a
sort
of
occult
secret
it
is
not
a
matter
of
prolonged
conversation
perhaps
images
created
by
the
briefest
of
unadorned
statements
produce
on
the
unwritten
tablets
of
the
child
mind
immediate
and
complete
impressions
safe
as
the
locked
garden
was
andrews
can
not
have
forgotten
her
charge
for
any
very
great
length
of
time
and
yet
before
donal
hearing
his
attendant
voice
from
her
corner
left
robin
to
join
her
and
be
taken
home
the
two
children
knew
each
other
intimately
robin
knew
that
donal
home
was
in
scotland
where
there
are
hills
and
moors
with
stags
on
them
he
lived
there
with
mother
and
he
had
been
brought
to
london
for
a
visit
the
person
he
called
mother
was
a
woman
who
took
care
of
him
and
he
spoke
of
her
quite
often
robin
did
not
think
she
was
like
andrews
though
she
did
not
in
the
least
know
why
on
his
part
donal
knew
about
the
nurseries
and
the
sparrows
who
hopped
about
on
the
slates
of
the
houses
opposite
robin
did
not
describe
the
nurseries
to
him
but
donal
knew
that
they
were
ugly
and
that
there
were
no
toys
in
them
and
nothing
to
do
also
in
some
mystic
fashion
he
realized
that
andrews
would
not
let
robin
play
with
him
if
she
saw
them
together
and
that
therefore
they
must
make
the
most
of
their
time
full
of
their
joy
in
each
other
they
actually
embarked
upon
an
ingenious
infant
intrigue
which
involved
their
trying
to
meet
behind
the
shrubs
if
they
were
brought
to
the
gardens
the
next
day
donal
was
sure
he
could
come
because
his
nurse
always
did
what
he
asked
of
her
he
was
so
big
now
that
she
was
not
a
real
nurse
but
she
had
been
his
nurse
when
he
was
quite
little
and
mother
liked
her
to
travel
with
them
he
had
a
tutor
but
he
had
stayed
behind
in
scotland
at
braemarnie
which
was
their
house
donal
would
come
tomorrow
and
he
would
look
for
robin
and
when
she
saw
him
she
must
get
away
from
andrews
and
they
would
play
together
again
i
will
bring
one
of
my
picture
books
he
said
grandly
can
you
read
at
all
no
answered
robin
adoring
him
what
are
picture
books
have
you
any
he
blurted
out
no
said
robin
she
looked
at
the
gravel
walk
reflecting
a
moment
thoughtfully
on
the
day
nursery
and
the
night
nursery
then
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
the
glowing
blueness
of
his
and
said
quite
simply
i
have
anything
he
suddenly
remembered
things
his
mother
had
told
him
about
poor
people
perhaps
she
was
poor
could
she
be
poor
when
her
frock
and
hat
and
coat
were
so
pretty
it
was
not
polite
to
ask
but
the
thought
made
him
love
her
more
he
felt
something
warm
rush
all
over
his
body
the
truth
if
he
had
been
old
enough
to
be
aware
of
it
was
that
the
entire
simpleness
of
her
acceptance
of
things
as
they
were
and
a
something
which
was
unconsciousness
of
any
cause
for
complaint
moved
his
child
masculinity
enormously
his
old
nurse
voice
came
from
her
corner
again
i
must
go
to
nanny
he
said
feeling
somehow
as
if
he
had
been
running
fast
i
come
tomorrow
and
bring
two
picture
books
he
was
a
loving
warm
blooded
child
human
thing
and
the
expression
of
affection
was
to
him
a
familiar
natural
impulse
he
put
his
strong
little
arms
round
her
and
kissed
her
full
on
her
mouth
as
he
embraced
her
with
all
his
strength
he
kissed
her
twice
it
was
the
first
time
for
robin
andrews
did
not
kiss
there
was
no
one
else
it
was
the
first
time
and
nature
had
also
made
her
a
loving
warm
blooded
human
thing
how
beautiful
he
was
how
big
how
strong
his
arms
were
and
how
soft
and
warm
his
mouth
felt
she
stood
and
gazed
at
him
with
wide
asking
eyes
and
laughed
a
little
she
had
no
words
because
she
did
not
know
what
had
happened
do
you
like
to
be
kissed
said
donal
uncertain
because
she
looked
so
startled
and
had
not
kissed
him
back
kissed
she
repeated
with
a
small
caught
breath
she
knew
now
what
it
was
it
was
being
kissed
she
drew
nearer
at
once
and
lifted
up
her
face
as
sweetly
and
gladly
as
a
flower
lifts
itself
to
the
sun
kiss
me
again
she
said
quite
eagerly
as
ingenuously
and
heartily
as
before
he
kissed
her
again
and
this
time
she
kissed
too
when
he
ran
quickly
away
she
stood
looking
after
him
with
smiling
trembling
lips
uplifted
joyful
wondering
and
amazed
chapter
viii
when
she
went
back
to
andrews
she
carried
the
pricked
leaves
with
her
she
could
not
have
left
them
behind
from
what
source
she
had
drawn
a
characterizing
passionate
though
silent
strength
of
mind
and
body
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
her
mind
and
her
emotions
had
been
left
utterly
unfed
but
they
were
not
of
the
inert
order
which
scarcely
needs
feeding
her
feeling
for
the
sparrows
had
held
more
than
she
could
have
expressed
her
secret
adoration
of
the
lady
downstairs
was
an
intense
thing
her
immediate
surrender
to
the
desire
in
the
first
pair
of
human
eyes
child
eyes
though
they
were
which
had
ever
called
to
her
being
for
response
was
simple
and
undiluted
rapture
she
had
passed
over
her
little
soul
without
a
moment
delay
and
without
any
knowledge
of
the
giving
it
had
flown
from
her
as
a
bird
might
fly
from
darkness
into
the
sun
donal
was
the
sun
no
special
tendency
to
innate
duplicity
was
denoted
by
the
fact
that
she
had
acquired
through
her
observation
of
andrews
jennings
jane
and
blayne
the
knowledge
that
there
were
things
it
was
best
not
to
let
other
people
know
you
were
careful
about
them
from
the
occult
communications
between
herself
and
donal
which
had
resulted
in
their
intrigue
there
had
of
course
evolved
a
realizing
sense
of
the
value
of
discretion
she
did
not
let
andrews
see
the
decorated
leaves
but
put
them
into
a
small
pocket
in
her
coat
her
machiavellian
intention
was
to
slip
them
out
when
she
was
taken
up
to
the
nursery
andrews
was
always
in
a
hurry
to
go
downstairs
to
her
lunch
and
she
would
be
left
alone
and
could
find
a
place
where
she
could
hide
them
andrews
friend
started
when
robin
drew
near
to
them
the
cheeks
and
lips
were
the
colour
of
jacqueminot
rose
petals
her
eyes
glowed
with
actual
rapture
my
word
that
a
beauty
if
i
ever
saw
one
said
the
woman
first
sight
makes
you
jump
my
word
robin
however
did
not
know
what
she
was
talking
about
and
in
fact
scarcely
heard
her
she
was
thinking
of
donal
she
thought
of
him
as
she
was
taken
home
and
she
did
not
cease
thinking
of
him
during
the
whole
rest
of
the
day
and
far
into
the
night
when
andrews
left
her
she
found
a
place
to
hide
the
pricked
leaves
and
before
she
put
them
away
she
did
what
donal
had
done
to
her
she
kissed
them
she
kissed
them
several
times
because
they
were
leaves
and
he
had
made
the
stars
and
lines
on
them
it
was
almost
like
kissing
donal
but
not
quite
so
beautiful
after
she
was
put
to
bed
at
night
and
andrews
left
her
she
lay
awake
for
a
long
time
she
did
not
want
to
go
to
sleep
because
everything
seemed
so
warm
and
wonderful
and
she
could
think
and
think
and
think
what
she
thought
about
was
donal
face
his
delightful
eyes
his
white
forehead
with
curly
hair
pushed
back
with
his
highland
bonnet
his
plaid
swung
about
when
he
ran
and
jumped
when
he
held
her
tight
the
buttons
of
his
jacket
hurt
her
a
little
because
they
pressed
against
her
body
what
was
mother
like
did
he
kiss
her
what
pretty
stones
there
were
in
his
clasps
and
buckles
how
nice
it
was
to
hear
him
laugh
and
how
fond
he
was
of
laughing
donal
donal
donal
he
liked
to
play
with
her
though
she
was
a
girl
and
so
little
he
would
play
with
her
tomorrow
his
cheeks
were
bright
pink
his
hair
was
bright
his
eyes
were
bright
he
was
all
bright
she
tried
to
see
into
the
blueness
of
his
eyes
again
as
it
seemed
when
they
looked
at
each
other
close
to
as
she
began
to
see
the
clear
colour
she
fell
asleep
the
power
which
had
on
the
first
morning
guided
robin
to
the
seclusion
behind
the
clump
of
shrubs
and
had
provided
andrews
with
an
enthralling
companion
extended
the
next
day
an
even
more
beneficient
and
complete
protection
andrews
was
smitten
with
a
cold
so
alarming
as
to
confine
her
to
bed
having
no
intention
of
running
any
risks
whatsoever
she
promptly
sent
for
a
younger
sister
who
temporarily
being
out
of
place
came
into
the
house
as
substitute
she
was
a
pretty
young
woman
who
assumed
no
special
responsibilities
and
was
fond
of
reading
novels
she
been
trained
to
be
no
trouble
anne
she
amuse
herself
without
bothering
you
as
long
as
you
keep
her
out
andrews
said
of
robin
anne
took
lady
audley
secret
with
her
to
the
gardens
and
having
led
her
charge
to
a
shady
and
comfortable
seat
which
exactly
suited
her
she
settled
herself
for
a
pleasant
morning
now
you
can
play
while
i
read
she
said
to
robin
as
they
had
entered
the
gardens
they
had
passed
not
far
from
the
gate
a
bench
on
which
sat
a
highly
respectable
looking
woman
who
was
hemming
a
delicate
bit
of
cambric
and
evidently
in
charge
of
two
picture
books
which
lay
on
the
seat
beside
her
a
fine
boy
in
highland
kilts
was
playing
a
few
yards
away
robin
felt
something
like
a
warm
flood
rush
over
her
and
her
joy
was
so
great
and
exquisite
that
she
wondered
if
anne
felt
her
hand
trembling
anne
did
not
because
she
was
looking
at
a
lady
getting
into
a
carriage
across
the
street
the
marvel
of
that
early
summer
morning
in
the
gardens
of
a
splendid
but
dingy
london
square
thing
was
not
a
thing
for
which
human
words
could
find
expression
it
was
not
an
earthly
thing
or
at
least
not
a
thing
belonging
to
an
earth
grown
old
a
child
adam
and
eve
might
have
known
something
like
it
in
the
garden
of
eden
it
was
as
clear
and
simple
as
spring
water
and
as
warm
as
the
sun
anne
permission
to
play
once
given
robin
found
her
way
behind
the
group
of
lilacs
and
snowballs
donal
would
come
not
only
because
he
was
so
big
that
nanny
would
let
him
do
what
he
wanted
to
do
but
because
he
would
do
everything
and
anything
in
the
world
donal
donal
her
heart
was
a
mere
baby
heart
but
it
beat
as
if
she
were
seventeen
beat
with
pure
rapture
he
was
all
bright
and
he
would
laugh
and
laugh
the
coming
was
easy
enough
for
donal
he
had
told
his
mother
and
nanny
rejoicingly
about
the
little
girl
he
had
made
friends
with
and
who
had
no
picture
books
but
he
did
not
come
straight
to
her
he
took
his
picture
books
under
his
arm
and
showing
all
his
white
teeth
in
a
joyous
grin
set
out
to
begin
their
play
properly
with
a
surprise
he
did
not
let
her
see
him
coming
but
stalked
her
behind
the
trees
and
bushes
until
he
found
where
she
was
waiting
and
then
thrust
his
face
between
the
branches
of
a
tall
shrub
near
her
and
laughed
the
outright
laugh
she
loved
and
when
she
turned
she
was
looking
straight
into
the
clear
blue
she
had
tried
to
see
when
she
fell
asleep
donal
donal
she
cried
like
a
little
bird
with
but
one
note
the
lilac
and
the
snowball
were
in
blossom
and
there
was
a
big
hawthorn
tree
which
smelt
sweet
and
sweet
they
could
not
see
the
drift
of
smuts
on
the
blossoms
they
only
smelled
the
sweetness
and
sat
under
the
hawthorn
and
sniffed
and
sniffed
the
sun
was
deliciously
warm
and
a
piano
organ
was
playing
beautifully
not
far
away
they
sat
close
to
each
other
so
close
that
the
picture
book
could
lie
open
on
both
pairs
of
knees
and
the
warmth
of
each
young
body
penetrated
the
softness
of
the
other
sometimes
donal
threw
an
arm
around
her
as
she
bent
over
the
page
love
and
caresses
were
not
amazements
to
him
he
accepted
them
as
parts
of
the
normal
joy
of
life
to
robin
they
were
absolute
wonder
the
pictures
were
delight
and
amazement
in
one
donal
knew
all
about
them
and
told
her
stories
she
felt
that
such
splendour
could
have
emanated
only
from
him
it
could
not
occur
to
her
that
he
had
not
invented
them
and
made
the
pictures
he
showed
her
robinson
crusoe
and
robin
hood
the
scent
of
the
hawthorn
and
lilac
intoxicated
them
and
they
laughed
tremendously
because
robin
hood
name
was
like
robin
own
and
he
was
a
man
and
she
was
a
girl
they
could
scarcely
stop
laughing
and
donal
rolled
over
and
over
on
the
grass
half
from
unconquerable
high
spirits
and
half
to
make
robin
laugh
still
more
he
had
some
beautiful
coloured
glass
marbles
in
his
pocket
and
he
showed
her
how
to
play
with
them
and
gave
her
two
of
the
prettiest
he
could
shoot
them
over
the
ground
in
a
way
to
thrill
the
beholder
he
could
hop
on
one
leg
as
far
as
he
liked
he
could
read
out
of
books
do
you
like
me
he
said
once
in
a
pause
between
displays
of
his
prowess
robin
was
kneeling
upon
the
grass
watching
him
and
she
clasped
her
little
hands
as
if
she
were
uttering
a
prayer
oh
yes
yes
she
yearned
yes
yes
i
like
you
he
answered
i
told
my
mother
all
about
you
he
came
to
her
and
knelt
by
her
side
have
you
a
mother
he
asked
no
shaking
her
head
do
you
live
with
your
aunt
no
i
do
live
with
anybody
he
looked
puzzled
is
there
any
lady
in
your
house
he
put
it
to
her
she
brightened
a
little
relieved
to
think
she
had
something
to
tell
him
there
the
lady
downstairs
she
said
she
so
pretty
so
pretty
is
she
he
stopped
and
shook
his
head
she
could
be
your
mother
he
corrected
himself
you
know
about
her
she
wears
pretty
clothes
sometimes
they
float
about
and
sparkle
and
she
wears
little
crowns
on
her
head
or
flowers
she
laughs
robin
described
eagerly
a
great
many
people
come
to
see
her
they
all
laugh
sometimes
they
sing
i
lie
in
bed
and
listen
does
she
ever
come
upstairs
to
the
nursery
inquired
donal
with
a
somewhat
reflective
air
yes
she
comes
and
stands
near
the
door
and
says
she
quite
well
andrews
she
does
not
laugh
then
she
she
looks
at
me
she
stopped
there
feeling
suddenly
that
she
wished
very
much
that
she
had
more
to
tell
what
she
was
saying
was
evidently
not
very
satisfactory
he
seemed
to
expect
more
and
she
had
no
more
to
give
a
sense
of
emptiness
crept
upon
her
and
for
no
reason
she
understood
there
was
a
little
click
in
her
throat
does
she
only
stand
near
the
door
he
suggested
as
one
putting
the
situation
to
a
sort
of
crucial
test
does
she
never
sit
on
a
big
chair
and
take
you
on
her
knee
no
no
in
a
dropped
voice
she
will
not
sit
down
she
says
the
chairs
are
grubby
does
she
love
you
at
all
persisted
donal
does
she
kiss
you
there
was
a
thing
she
had
known
for
what
seemed
to
her
a
long
time
god
knows
in
what
mysterious
fashion
she
had
learned
it
but
learned
it
well
she
had
that
no
human
being
but
herself
was
aware
of
her
knowledge
was
inevitable
to
whom
could
she
have
told
it
but
donal
donal
wanted
to
know
all
about
her
the
little
click
made
itself
felt
in
her
throat
again
she
she
does
like
me
her
dropped
voice
was
the
whisper
of
one
humbled
to
the
dust
by
confession
she
does
like
me
and
the
click
became
another
thing
which
made
her
put
up
her
arm
over
her
eyes
her
round
troubled
child
eyes
which
as
she
had
looked
into
donal
had
widened
with
sudden
bewildered
tears
donal
flung
his
arms
round
her
and
squeezed
his
buttons
into
her
tender
chest
he
hugged
her
close
he
kissed
her
there
was
a
choking
in
his
throat
he
was
hot
all
over
she
does
like
you
she
must
like
you
i
make
her
he
cried
passionately
she
not
your
mother
if
she
was
she
love
you
she
love
you
do
mothers
you
the
small
voice
asked
with
a
half
sob
what
what
love
you
it
was
not
vulgar
curiosity
she
only
wanted
to
find
out
he
loosed
his
embrace
sitting
back
on
his
heels
to
stare
do
you
know
she
shook
her
head
with
soft
meekness
she
answered
big
boys
like
himself
did
not
usually
play
with
such
little
girls
but
something
had
drawn
him
to
her
at
their
first
moment
of
encounter
she
was
like
any
other
little
girls
he
felt
it
all
the
time
and
that
was
part
of
the
thing
which
drew
him
he
was
not
of
course
aware
that
the
male
thrill
at
being
regarded
as
one
who
is
a
god
had
its
power
over
the
emotions
she
making
silly
fun
and
pretending
she
really
did
know
because
she
was
different
it
liking
very
much
it
more
he
explained
my
mother
loves
me
i
i
love
you
stoutly
yes
i
love
you
that
why
i
kissed
you
when
you
cried
she
was
so
uplifted
so
overwhelmed
with
adoring
gratitude
that
as
she
knelt
on
the
grass
she
worshipped
him
i
love
you
she
answered
him
i
love
you
love
you
and
she
looked
at
him
with
such
actual
prayerfulness
that
he
caught
at
her
and
with
manly
promptness
kissed
her
again
this
being
mere
nature
because
he
was
eight
years
old
and
she
was
six
her
tears
flashed
away
and
they
both
laughed
joyously
as
they
sat
down
on
the
grass
again
to
talk
it
over
he
told
her
all
the
pleasant
things
he
knew
about
mothers
the
world
was
full
of
them
it
seemed
full
you
belong
to
them
from
the
time
you
were
a
baby
he
had
not
known
many
personally
because
he
had
always
lived
at
braemarnie
which
was
in
the
country
in
scotland
there
were
no
houses
near
his
home
you
had
to
drive
miles
and
miles
before
you
came
to
a
house
or
a
castle
he
had
not
seen
much
of
other
children
except
a
few
who
lived
at
the
manse
and
belonged
to
the
minister
children
had
fathers
as
well
as
mothers
fathers
did
not
love
you
or
take
care
of
you
quite
as
much
as
mothers
because
they
were
men
but
they
loved
you
too
his
own
father
had
died
when
he
was
a
baby
his
mother
loved
him
as
much
as
he
loved
her
she
was
beautiful
but
it
seemed
to
reveal
itself
not
like
the
lady
downstairs
she
did
not
laugh
very
much
though
she
laughed
when
they
played
together
he
was
too
big
now
to
sit
on
her
knee
but
squeezed
into
the
big
chair
beside
her
when
she
read
or
told
him
stories
he
always
did
what
his
mother
told
him
she
knew
everything
in
the
world
and
so
knew
what
he
ought
to
do
even
when
he
was
a
big
man
he
should
do
what
his
mother
told
him
robin
listened
to
every
word
with
enraptured
eyes
and
bated
breath
this
was
the
story
of
love
and
life
and
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
heard
it
it
was
as
much
a
revelation
as
the
kiss
she
had
spent
her
days
in
the
grimy
nursery
and
her
one
close
intimate
had
been
a
bony
woman
who
had
taught
her
not
to
cry
employing
the
practical
method
of
terrifying
her
into
silence
by
pinching
her
knowing
it
was
quite
safe
to
do
it
it
had
not
been
necessary
to
do
it
often
she
had
seen
people
on
the
streets
but
she
had
only
seen
them
in
passing
by
she
had
not
watched
them
as
she
had
watched
the
sparrows
when
she
was
taken
down
for
a
few
minutes
into
the
basement
she
vaguely
knew
that
she
was
in
the
way
and
that
blayne
and
andrews
and
jennings
low
voices
and
occasional
sidelong
look
meant
that
they
were
talking
about
her
and
did
not
want
her
to
hear
i
have
no
mother
and
no
father
she
explained
quite
simply
to
donal
no
one
kisses
me
no
one
donal
said
feeling
curious
has
no
one
ever
kissed
you
but
me
no
she
answered
donal
laughed
because
children
always
laugh
when
they
do
not
know
what
else
to
do
was
that
why
you
looked
as
if
you
were
frightened
when
i
said
to
you
yesterday
did
know
said
robin
laughing
a
little
too
but
not
very
much
i
was
frightened
i
liked
you
i
kiss
you
as
often
as
you
want
me
to
he
volunteered
nobly
i
used
to
it
because
of
my
mother
i
kiss
you
again
now
and
he
did
it
quite
without
embarrassment
it
was
a
sort
of
manly
gratuity
once
anne
with
her
book
in
her
hand
came
round
the
shrubs
to
see
how
her
charge
was
employing
herself
and
seeing
her
looking
at
pictures
with
a
handsomely
dressed
companion
she
returned
to
lady
audley
secret
feeling
entirely
safe
the
lilac
and
the
hawthorn
tree
continued
to
breathe
forth
warmed
scents
of
paradise
in
the
sunshine
the
piano
organ
went
on
playing
sometimes
nearer
sometimes
farther
away
but
evidently
finding
the
neighbourhood
a
desirable
one
sometimes
the
children
laughed
at
each
other
sometimes
at
pictures
donal
showed
or
stories
he
told
or
at
his
own
extreme
wit
the
boundaries
were
removed
from
robin
world
she
began
to
understand
that
there
was
another
larger
one
containing
wonderful
and
delightful
things
she
had
known
nothing
about
donal
was
revealing
it
to
her
in
everything
he
said
even
when
he
was
not
aware
that
he
was
telling
her
anything
when
eve
was
formed
from
the
rib
of
adam
the
information
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
give
her
regarding
her
surroundings
must
have
filled
her
with
enthralling
interest
and
a
reverence
which
adored
the
planted
enclosure
which
was
the
central
feature
of
the
soot
sprinkled
stately
london
square
was
as
the
garden
of
eden
the
garden
of
eden
it
remained
for
two
weeks
andrews
cold
was
serious
enough
to
require
a
doctor
and
her
sister
anne
continued
to
perform
their
duties
the
weather
was
exceptionally
fine
and
being
a
vain
young
woman
she
liked
to
dress
robin
in
her
pretty
clothes
and
take
her
out
because
she
was
a
beauty
and
attracted
attention
to
her
nurse
as
well
as
to
herself
mornings
spent
under
the
trees
reading
were
entirely
satisfactory
each
morning
the
children
played
together
and
each
night
robin
lay
awake
and
lived
again
the
delights
of
the
past
hours
each
day
she
learned
more
wonders
and
her
young
mind
and
soul
were
fed
there
began
to
stir
in
her
brain
new
thoughts
and
the
beginning
of
questioning
scotland
braemarnie
donal
mother
even
the
manse
and
the
children
in
it
combined
to
form
a
world
of
enchantment
there
were
hills
with
stags
living
in
them
there
were
moors
with
purple
heather
and
yellow
brome
and
gorse
birds
built
their
nests
under
the
bushes
and
donal
pony
knew
exactly
where
to
step
even
in
the
roughest
places
there
were
two
boys
and
two
girls
at
the
manse
and
they
had
a
father
and
a
mother
these
things
were
enough
for
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
to
form
themselves
around
the
centre
of
the
whole
universe
was
donal
with
his
strength
and
his
laugh
and
his
eyes
which
were
so
alive
and
glowing
that
she
seemed
always
to
see
them
she
knew
nothing
about
the
thing
which
was
their
somehow
allure
they
were
asking
eyes
and
eyes
which
gave
the
boy
was
in
truth
a
splendid
creature
his
body
and
beauty
were
perfect
life
and
joyous
perfect
living
his
eyes
asked
other
eyes
for
everything
tell
me
more
they
said
tell
me
more
like
me
answer
me
let
us
give
each
other
everything
in
the
world
he
had
always
been
well
he
had
always
been
happy
he
had
always
been
praised
and
loved
he
had
known
no
other
things
during
the
first
week
in
which
the
two
children
played
together
his
mother
whose
intense
desire
it
was
to
understand
him
observed
in
him
a
certain
absorption
of
mood
when
he
was
not
talking
or
amusing
himself
actively
he
began
to
fall
into
a
habit
of
standing
at
the
windows
often
with
his
chin
in
his
hand
looking
out
as
if
he
were
so
full
of
thought
that
he
saw
nothing
it
was
not
an
old
habit
it
was
a
new
one
what
are
you
thinking
about
donal
she
asked
one
afternoon
he
seemed
to
awaken
as
it
were
when
he
heard
her
he
turned
about
with
his
alluring
smile
i
am
thinking
it
is
funny
he
said
it
is
funny
that
i
should
like
such
a
little
girl
such
a
lot
she
is
years
and
years
younger
than
i
am
but
i
like
her
so
it
is
such
fun
to
tell
her
things
he
marched
over
to
his
mother
writing
table
and
leaned
against
it
what
his
mother
saw
was
that
he
had
an
impassioned
desire
to
talk
about
this
child
she
felt
it
was
a
desire
even
a
trifle
abnormal
in
its
eagerness
she
has
such
a
queer
house
i
think
he
explained
she
has
a
nurse
and
such
pretty
clothes
and
she
is
so
pretty
herself
but
i
do
believe
she
has
any
toys
or
books
in
her
nursery
where
is
her
mother
she
must
be
dead
there
is
no
lady
in
her
house
but
the
lady
downstairs
she
is
very
pretty
and
is
always
laughing
but
she
is
not
her
mother
because
she
does
like
her
and
she
never
kisses
her
i
think
that
the
queerest
thing
of
all
no
one
had
ever
kissed
her
till
i
did
his
mother
was
a
woman
given
to
psychological
analysis
her
eyes
began
to
dwell
on
his
face
with
slightly
anxious
questioning
did
you
kiss
her
she
inquired
yes
i
kissed
her
when
i
said
good
morning
the
first
day
i
thought
she
did
like
me
to
do
it
but
she
did
it
was
only
because
no
one
had
ever
done
it
before
she
likes
it
very
much
he
leaned
farther
over
the
writing
table
and
began
to
pour
forth
his
smile
growing
and
his
eyes
full
of
pleasure
his
mother
was
a
trifle
alarmedly
struck
by
the
feeling
that
he
was
talking
like
a
young
man
in
love
who
can
not
keep
his
tongue
still
though
in
his
case
even
the
youngest
manhood
was
years
away
and
he
made
no
effort
to
conceal
his
sentiments
which
a
young
man
would
certainly
have
striven
to
do
she
got
such
a
pretty
little
face
and
such
a
pretty
mouth
and
cheeks
he
touched
a
jacqueminot
rose
in
a
vase
they
are
the
colour
of
that
today
a
robin
came
with
the
sparrows
and
hopped
about
near
us
we
laughed
and
laughed
because
her
eyes
are
like
the
robin
and
she
is
called
robin
i
wish
you
would
come
into
the
gardens
and
see
her
mother
she
likes
everything
i
do
i
must
come
dear
she
answered
nanny
thinks
she
is
lovely
he
announced
she
says
i
am
in
love
with
her
am
i
mother
you
are
too
young
to
be
in
love
she
said
and
even
when
you
are
older
you
must
not
fall
in
love
with
people
you
know
nothing
about
it
was
an
unconscious
bit
of
scotch
cautiousness
which
she
at
once
realized
was
absurd
and
quite
out
of
place
but
she
realized
it
because
he
stood
up
and
squared
his
shoulders
in
an
odd
way
he
had
not
flushed
even
faintly
before
and
now
a
touch
of
colour
crept
under
his
fair
skin
but
i
do
love
her
he
said
i
do
i
ca
stop
and
though
he
was
quite
simple
and
obviously
little
she
actually
felt
frightened
for
a
moment
chapter
ix
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day
upon
which
this
occurred
coombe
was
standing
in
feather
with
a
cup
of
tea
in
his
hand
and
wearing
the
look
of
a
man
who
is
given
up
to
reflection
i
saw
muir
today
for
the
first
time
for
several
years
he
said
after
a
silence
she
is
in
london
with
the
boy
is
she
as
handsome
as
ever
quite
hers
is
not
the
beauty
that
disappears
it
is
line
and
bearing
and
a
sort
of
splendid
grace
and
harmony
what
is
the
boy
like
coombe
reflected
again
before
he
answered
he
is
amazing
one
so
seldom
sees
anything
approaching
physical
perfection
that
it
strikes
one
a
sort
of
blow
when
one
comes
upon
it
suddenly
face
to
face
is
he
as
beautiful
as
all
that
the
greeks
used
to
make
statues
of
bodies
like
his
they
often
called
them
gods
but
not
always
the
creative
intention
plainly
was
that
all
human
beings
should
be
beautiful
and
he
is
the
expression
of
it
feather
was
pretending
to
embroider
a
pink
flower
on
a
bit
of
gauze
and
she
smiled
vaguely
i
do
know
what
you
mean
she
admitted
with
no
abasement
of
spirit
but
if
ever
there
was
any
intention
of
that
kind
it
has
not
been
carried
out
her
smile
broke
into
a
little
laugh
as
she
stuck
her
needle
into
her
work
i
thinking
of
henry
she
let
drop
in
addition
so
was
i
it
happened
answered
coombe
after
a
second
or
so
of
pause
henry
was
the
next
of
kin
who
was
to
coombe
great
objection
his
heir
presumptive
and
was
universally
admitted
to
be
a
repulsive
sort
of
person
both
physically
and
morally
he
had
brought
into
the
world
a
weakly
and
rickety
framework
and
had
from
mere
boyhood
devoted
himself
to
a
life
which
would
have
undermined
a
hercules
a
relative
may
so
easily
present
the
aspect
of
an
unfortunate
incident
over
which
one
has
no
control
this
was
the
case
with
henry
his
character
and
appearance
were
such
that
even
his
connection
with
an
important
heritage
was
not
enough
to
induce
respectable
persons
to
accept
him
in
any
form
but
if
coombe
remained
without
issue
henry
would
be
the
head
of
the
house
how
is
his
cough
inquired
feather
frightful
he
is
an
emaciated
wreck
and
he
has
no
physical
cause
for
remaining
alive
feather
made
three
or
four
stitches
does
muir
know
she
said
if
muir
is
conscious
of
his
miserable
existence
that
is
all
he
answered
she
is
not
the
woman
to
inquire
of
course
she
can
not
help
knowing
that
when
he
is
done
with
her
boy
takes
his
place
in
the
line
of
succession
oh
yes
she
know
that
put
in
feather
it
was
coombe
who
smiled
now
very
faintly
you
have
a
mistaken
view
of
her
he
said
you
admire
her
very
much
feather
bridled
the
figure
of
this
big
scotch
creature
with
her
line
and
her
splendid
grace
and
harmony
was
enough
to
make
one
bridle
she
does
admire
me
said
coombe
she
is
not
proud
of
me
as
a
connection
she
does
really
want
the
position
for
the
boy
in
her
heart
of
hearts
does
want
it
feather
exclamation
was
a
little
jeer
only
because
she
would
not
have
dared
a
big
one
she
is
scotch
early
victorian
in
some
things
and
extremely
advanced
in
others
he
went
on
she
has
strong
ideas
of
her
own
as
to
how
he
shall
be
brought
up
she
rather
greek
in
her
feeling
for
his
being
as
perfect
physically
and
mentally
as
she
can
help
him
to
be
she
believes
things
it
was
she
who
said
what
you
did
not
understand
about
the
creative
intention
i
suppose
she
is
religious
feather
said
scotch
people
often
are
but
their
religion
is
usually
like
that
creative
a
new
name
for
god
i
suppose
i
ought
to
know
all
about
god
heard
enough
about
him
my
father
was
not
a
clergyman
but
he
was
very
miserable
and
it
made
him
so
religious
that
he
was
almost
one
we
were
every
one
of
us
christened
and
catechized
and
confirmed
and
all
that
so
god
rather
an
old
story
queer
how
old
from
greenland
icy
mountains
to
india
coral
strand
said
coombe
it
an
ancient
search
that
for
the
idea
whether
it
takes
form
in
metal
or
wood
or
stone
well
said
feather
holding
her
bit
of
gauze
away
from
her
the
better
to
criticize
the
pink
flower
as
almost
a
daughter
i
must
say
that
if
there
is
one
thing
god
did
do
it
was
to
fill
the
world
with
beautiful
people
and
things
as
if
it
was
only
to
be
happy
in
it
was
made
to
to
try
us
by
suffering
and
that
sort
of
thing
it
what
d
call
it
something
beginning
with
probation
suggested
coombe
regarding
her
with
an
expression
of
speculative
interest
her
airy
bringing
forth
of
her
glib
little
scraps
of
orthodoxy
as
one
who
fished
them
out
of
a
bag
of
remnants
of
rubbish
was
so
true
to
type
that
it
almost
fascinated
him
for
a
moment
yes
that
it
probation
she
answered
i
knew
it
began
with
a
it
means
paths
and
of
blood
and
if
you
are
religious
you
them
with
bleeding
feet
or
swim
them
as
the
people
do
in
hymns
and
you
praise
and
glorify
all
the
time
you
doing
it
of
course
i
not
religious
myself
and
i
say
i
think
it
pleasant
but
i
do
know
every
body
beautiful
and
perfect
indeed
that
not
religion
it
being
irreligious
good
gracious
think
of
the
cripples
and
lepers
and
hunchbacks
and
the
idea
is
that
god
made
them
all
by
way
of
entertaining
himself
he
put
it
to
her
quietly
well
who
else
did
said
feather
cheerfully
i
do
know
he
said
certain
things
i
heard
muir
say
suggested
to
one
that
it
might
be
interesting
to
think
it
out
did
she
talk
to
you
about
god
at
afternoon
tea
said
feather
it
the
kind
of
thing
a
religious
scotch
woman
might
do
no
she
did
not
talk
to
me
perhaps
that
was
her
mistake
she
might
have
reformed
me
she
never
says
more
to
me
than
civility
demands
and
it
was
not
at
tea
i
accidentally
dropped
in
on
the
bethunes
and
found
an
oriental
had
been
lecturing
there
muir
was
talking
to
him
and
i
heard
her
the
man
seemed
to
be
a
scholar
and
a
deep
thinker
and
as
they
talked
a
group
of
us
stood
and
listened
or
asked
questions
how
funny
said
feather
it
was
not
funny
at
all
it
was
astonishingly
calm
and
serious
and
logical
the
logic
was
the
new
note
i
had
never
thought
of
reason
in
that
connection
reason
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
you
must
have
faith
you
must
just
believe
what
you
told
not
think
at
all
thinking
is
wickedness
unless
you
think
what
you
hear
preached
feather
was
even
a
trifle
delicately
smug
as
she
rattled
off
her
orthodoxy
but
she
laughed
after
she
had
done
with
it
but
it
must
have
been
funny
a
turk
or
a
hindoo
in
a
turban
and
a
thing
like
a
tea
gown
and
muir
in
her
edinburgh
looking
clothes
talking
about
god
you
are
quite
out
of
it
coombe
did
not
smile
at
all
as
he
said
it
the
oriental
was
as
physically
beautiful
as
donal
muir
is
and
muir
no
other
woman
in
the
room
compared
with
her
perhaps
people
who
think
grow
beautiful
feather
was
not
often
alluring
or
coquettish
in
her
manner
to
coombe
but
she
tilted
her
head
prettily
and
looked
down
at
her
flower
through
lovely
lashes
do
think
she
said
and
i
am
not
so
bad
looking
no
he
answered
coldly
you
are
not
at
times
you
look
like
a
young
angel
if
muir
is
like
that
she
said
after
a
brief
pause
i
should
like
to
know
what
she
thinks
of
me
no
you
would
not
neither
should
i
if
she
thinks
at
all
was
his
answer
but
you
remember
you
said
you
did
not
mind
that
sort
of
thing
i
do
why
should
i
it
ca
harm
me
her
hint
of
a
pout
made
her
mouth
entrancing
but
if
she
thinks
good
looks
are
the
result
of
religiousness
i
should
like
to
let
her
see
robin
and
compare
her
with
her
boy
i
saw
robin
in
the
park
last
week
and
she
a
perfect
beauty
last
week
said
coombe
she
does
need
anyone
but
andrews
i
should
bore
her
to
death
if
i
went
and
sat
in
the
nursery
and
stared
at
her
no
one
does
that
sort
of
thing
in
these
days
but
i
should
like
to
see
muir
to
see
the
two
children
together
that
could
not
easily
be
arranged
i
am
afraid
he
said
why
not
his
answer
was
politely
deliberate
she
greatly
disapproves
of
me
i
have
told
you
she
is
not
proud
of
the
relationship
she
does
not
like
me
you
mean
excuse
me
i
mean
exactly
what
i
said
in
telling
you
that
she
has
her
own
very
strong
views
of
the
boy
training
and
surroundings
they
may
be
ridiculous
but
that
sort
of
thing
need
not
trouble
you
feather
held
up
her
hand
and
actually
laughed
if
robin
meets
him
in
ten
years
from
now
that
for
her
very
strong
views
of
his
training
and
surroundings
and
she
snapped
her
fingers
muir
distaste
for
her
son
unavoidable
connection
the
man
he
might
succeed
had
a
firm
foundation
she
had
been
brought
up
in
a
scottish
manse
where
her
father
dominated
as
an
omnipotent
and
almost
divine
authority
as
a
child
of
imagination
she
had
not
been
happy
but
she
had
been
obedient
in
her
girlhood
she
had
varied
from
type
through
her
marriage
with
a
young
man
who
was
a
dreamer
an
advanced
thinker
an
impassioned
greek
scholar
and
a
lover
of
beauty
after
he
had
released
her
from
her
terrors
of
damnation
they
had
been
profoundly
happy
they
were
young
and
at
ease
and
they
read
and
thought
together
ardently
they
explored
new
creeds
and
cults
and
sometimes
found
themselves
talking
nonsense
and
sometimes
discovering
untrodden
paths
of
wisdom
they
were
youthful
enough
to
be
solemn
about
things
at
times
and
clever
enough
to
laugh
at
their
solemnity
when
they
awakened
to
it
helen
muir
left
the
reverent
gloom
of
the
life
at
the
manse
far
behind
despite
her
respect
for
certain
meanings
they
beclouded
i
live
in
a
new
structure
she
said
to
her
husband
but
it
is
built
on
a
foundation
which
is
like
a
solid
subterranean
chamber
i
do
use
the
subterranean
chamber
or
go
into
it
i
do
want
to
but
now
and
then
echoes
almost
noises
make
themselves
heard
in
it
sometimes
i
find
i
have
listened
in
spite
of
myself
she
had
always
been
rather
grave
about
her
little
son
and
when
her
husband
early
death
left
him
and
his
dignified
but
not
large
estate
in
her
care
she
realized
that
there
lay
in
her
hands
the
power
to
direct
a
life
as
she
chose
in
as
far
as
was
humanly
possible
the
pure
blood
and
healthy
tendencies
of
a
long
and
fine
ancestry
expressing
themselves
in
the
boy
splendid
body
and
unusual
beauty
had
set
the
minds
of
two
imaginative
people
working
from
the
first
one
of
muir
deepest
interests
was
the
study
of
development
of
the
race
it
was
he
who
had
planted
in
her
mind
that
daringly
fearless
thought
of
a
human
perfection
as
to
the
intention
of
the
creative
cause
they
used
to
look
at
the
child
as
he
lay
asleep
and
note
the
beauty
of
him
his
hands
his
feet
his
torso
the
tint
and
texture
and
line
of
him
this
is
what
was
meant
in
the
plan
for
every
human
being
how
could
there
be
scamping
and
inefficiency
in
creation
it
is
we
ourselves
who
have
scamped
and
been
incomplete
in
our
thought
and
life
here
he
is
look
at
him
but
he
will
only
develop
as
he
is
if
living
does
not
warp
him
this
was
what
his
father
said
his
mother
was
at
her
gravest
as
she
looked
down
at
the
little
god
in
the
crib
it
as
if
some
power
had
thrust
a
casket
of
loose
jewels
into
our
hands
and
said
is
for
you
to
see
that
not
one
is
lost
she
murmured
then
the
looked
up
and
smiled
are
we
being
solemn
over
a
baby
she
said
perhaps
he
was
always
even
readier
to
smile
than
she
was
an
idea
however
that
there
enough
to
be
solemn
about
not
too
solemn
but
just
solemn
enough
you
are
a
beautiful
thing
fair
helen
why
should
he
be
like
you
neither
of
us
will
forget
what
we
have
just
said
through
her
darkest
hours
of
young
bereavement
she
remembered
the
words
many
times
and
felt
as
if
they
were
a
sort
of
light
she
might
hold
in
her
hand
as
she
trod
the
paths
of
the
afterwards
which
were
in
the
days
before
her
she
lived
with
donal
at
braemarnie
and
lived
for
him
without
neglecting
her
duty
of
being
the
head
of
a
household
and
an
estate
and
also
a
good
and
gracious
neighbour
to
things
and
people
she
kept
watch
over
every
jewel
in
his
casket
great
and
small
he
was
so
much
a
part
of
her
religion
that
sometimes
she
realized
that
the
echoes
from
the
subterranean
chamber
were
perhaps
making
her
a
little
strict
but
she
tried
to
keep
guard
over
herself
he
was
handsome
and
radiant
with
glowing
health
and
vitality
he
was
a
friendly
rejoicing
creature
and
as
full
of
the
joy
of
life
as
a
scampering
moor
pony
he
was
clever
enough
but
not
too
clever
and
he
was
friends
with
the
world
braemarnie
was
picturesquely
ancient
and
beautiful
it
would
be
a
home
of
sufficient
ease
and
luxury
to
be
a
pleasure
but
no
burden
life
in
it
could
be
perfect
and
also
supply
freedom
coombe
court
and
coombe
keep
were
huge
and
castellated
and
demanded
great
things
even
if
the
head
of
the
house
had
been
a
man
to
like
and
be
proud
of
the
accession
of
a
beautiful
young
marquis
would
rouse
the
hounds
of
war
so
to
speak
and
set
them
racing
upon
his
track
even
the
totally
unalluring
henry
had
been
beset
with
temptations
from
his
earliest
years
that
he
promptly
succumbed
to
the
first
only
brought
forth
others
it
did
not
seem
fair
that
a
creature
so
different
a
splendid
fearless
thing
should
be
dragged
from
his
hills
and
moors
and
fair
heather
and
made
to
breathe
the
foul
scent
of
things
of
whose
poison
he
could
know
nothing
she
was
not
an
ignorant
childish
woman
in
her
fine
aloof
way
she
had
learned
much
in
her
stays
in
london
with
her
husband
and
in
their
explorings
of
foreign
cities
this
was
the
reason
for
her
views
of
her
boy
training
and
surroundings
she
had
not
asked
questions
about
coombe
himself
but
it
had
not
been
necessary
once
or
twice
she
had
seen
feather
by
chance
in
spite
of
herself
she
had
heard
about
henry
now
and
then
he
was
furbished
up
and
appeared
briefly
at
coombe
court
or
at
the
keep
it
was
always
briefly
because
he
inevitably
began
to
verge
on
misbehaving
himself
after
hours
had
passed
on
his
last
visit
to
coombe
house
in
town
where
he
had
turned
up
without
invitation
he
had
become
so
frightfully
drunk
that
he
had
been
barely
rescued
from
the
trifling
faux
pas
of
attempting
to
kiss
a
very
young
royal
princess
there
were
quite
definite
objections
to
henry
helen
muir
was
not
proud
of
the
coombe
relationship
and
with
unvaried
and
resourceful
good
breeding
kept
herself
and
her
boy
from
all
chance
of
being
drawn
into
anything
approaching
an
intimacy
donal
knew
nothing
of
his
prospects
there
would
be
time
enough
for
that
when
he
was
older
but
in
the
meantime
there
should
be
no
intercourse
if
it
could
be
avoided
she
had
smiled
at
herself
when
the
echo
had
prompted
her
to
the
hint
of
a
quaint
caution
in
connection
with
his
little
boy
flame
of
delight
in
the
strange
child
he
had
made
friends
with
but
it
had
been
a
flame
and
though
she
had
smiled
she
sat
very
still
by
the
window
later
that
night
and
she
had
felt
a
touch
of
weight
on
her
heart
as
she
thought
it
over
there
were
wonderful
years
when
one
could
give
one
children
all
the
things
they
wanted
she
was
saying
to
herself
the
desires
of
their
child
hearts
the
joy
of
their
child
bodies
their
little
raptures
of
delight
those
were
divine
years
they
were
so
safe
then
donal
was
living
through
those
years
now
he
did
not
know
that
any
happiness
could
be
taken
from
him
he
was
hers
and
she
was
his
it
would
be
horrible
if
there
were
anything
one
could
not
let
him
keep
in
this
early
unshadowed
time
she
was
looking
out
at
the
spring
night
with
all
its
stars
lit
and
gleaming
over
the
park
which
she
could
see
from
her
window
suddenly
she
left
her
chair
and
rang
for
nanny
nanny
she
said
when
the
old
nurse
came
tell
me
something
about
the
little
girl
donal
plays
with
in
the
square
gardens
she
a
bonny
thing
and
finely
dressed
was
the
careful
answer
but
i
do
make
friends
with
strange
nurses
and
i
do
think
much
of
hers
she
a
young
dawdler
who
sits
novel
reading
and
if
master
donal
were
a
young
pickpocket
with
the
measles
the
child
would
be
playing
with
him
just
the
same
as
far
as
i
can
see
the
young
woman
sits
under
a
tree
and
reads
and
the
pretty
little
thing
may
do
what
she
likes
i
keep
my
eye
on
them
however
and
they
in
no
mischief
master
donal
reads
out
of
his
picture
books
and
shows
himself
off
before
her
grandly
and
she
laughs
and
looks
up
to
him
as
if
he
were
a
king
every
lad
child
likes
a
woman
child
to
look
up
to
him
it
pretty
to
see
the
pair
of
them
they
daft
about
each
other
just
wee
things
in
love
at
first
sight
donal
has
known
very
few
girls
those
plain
little
things
at
the
manse
are
too
dull
for
him
his
mother
said
slowly
this
one
not
plain
and
she
not
dull
nanny
answered
my
word
but
she
like
a
bit
of
witch
fire
dancing
with
her
colour
and
her
big
silk
curls
in
a
heap
donal
stares
at
her
like
a
young
man
at
a
beauty
i
wish
we
knew
more
of
her
forbears
i
must
see
her
muir
said
tomorrow
i
go
with
you
both
to
the
gardens
therefore
the
following
day
donal
pranced
proudly
up
the
path
to
his
trysting
place
and
with
him
walked
a
tall
lady
at
whom
people
looked
as
she
passed
she
was
fair
like
donal
and
had
a
small
head
softly
swathed
with
lovely
folds
of
hair
also
her
eyes
were
very
clear
and
calm
donal
was
plainly
proud
and
happy
to
be
with
her
and
was
indeed
prancing
though
his
prance
was
broken
by
walking
steps
at
intervals
robin
was
waiting
behind
the
lilac
bushes
and
her
nurse
was
already
deep
in
the
mystery
of
lady
audley
there
she
is
cried
donal
and
he
ran
to
her
my
mother
has
come
with
me
she
wants
to
see
you
too
and
he
pulled
her
forward
by
her
hand
this
is
robin
mother
this
is
robin
he
panted
with
elation
and
stood
holding
his
prize
as
if
she
might
get
away
before
he
had
displayed
her
his
eyes
lifted
to
his
tall
mother
were
those
of
an
exultant
owner
robin
had
no
desire
to
run
away
to
adore
anything
which
belonged
to
donal
was
only
nature
and
this
tall
fair
wonderful
person
was
a
mother
no
wonder
donal
talked
of
her
so
much
the
child
could
only
look
up
at
her
as
donal
did
so
they
stood
hand
in
hand
like
little
worshippers
before
a
deity
andrews
sister
in
her
pride
had
attired
the
small
creature
like
a
flower
of
spring
her
exquisiteness
and
her
physical
brilliancy
gave
muir
something
not
unlike
a
slight
shock
oh
no
wonder
since
she
was
like
that
she
stooped
and
kissed
the
round
cheek
delicately
donal
wanted
me
to
see
his
little
friend
she
said
i
always
want
to
see
his
playmates
shall
we
walk
round
the
garden
together
and
you
shall
show
me
where
you
play
and
tell
me
all
about
it
she
took
the
small
hand
and
they
walked
slowly
robin
was
at
first
too
much
awed
to
talk
but
as
donal
was
not
awed
at
all
and
continued
his
prancing
and
the
mother
lady
said
pretty
things
about
the
flowers
and
the
grass
and
the
birds
and
even
about
the
pony
at
braemarnie
she
began
now
and
then
to
break
into
a
little
hop
herself
and
presently
into
sudden
ripples
of
laughter
like
a
bird
brief
bubble
of
song
the
tall
lady
hand
was
not
like
andrews
or
the
hand
of
andrews
sister
it
did
not
pull
or
jerk
and
it
had
a
lovely
feeling
the
sensation
she
did
not
know
was
happiness
again
welled
up
within
her
just
one
walk
round
the
garden
and
then
the
tall
lady
sat
down
on
a
seat
to
watch
them
play
it
was
wonderful
she
did
not
read
or
work
she
sat
and
watched
them
as
if
she
wanted
to
do
that
more
than
anything
else
donal
kept
calling
out
to
her
and
making
her
smile
he
ran
backwards
and
forwards
to
her
to
ask
questions
and
tell
her
what
they
were
making
up
to
play
when
they
gathered
leaves
to
prick
stars
and
circles
on
they
did
them
on
the
seat
on
which
she
sat
and
she
helped
them
with
new
designs
several
times
in
the
midst
of
her
play
robin
stopped
and
stood
still
a
moment
with
a
sort
of
puzzled
expression
it
was
because
she
did
not
feel
like
robin
two
people
a
big
boy
and
a
lady
letting
her
play
and
talk
to
them
as
if
they
liked
her
and
had
time
the
truth
was
that
muir
eyes
followed
robin
more
than
they
followed
donal
their
clear
deeps
yearned
over
her
such
a
glowing
vital
little
thing
no
wonder
no
wonder
and
as
she
grew
older
she
would
be
more
vivid
and
compelling
with
every
year
and
donal
was
of
her
kind
his
strength
his
beauty
his
fearless
temperament
how
could
one
with
dignity
and
delicacy
find
out
why
she
had
this
obvious
air
of
belonging
to
nobody
donal
was
an
exact
little
lad
he
had
had
foundation
for
his
curious
scraps
of
her
story
no
mother
no
playthings
or
books
no
one
had
ever
kissed
her
and
she
dressed
and
soignee
like
this
who
was
the
lady
downstairs
a
victoria
was
driving
past
the
gardens
it
was
going
slowly
because
the
two
people
in
it
wished
to
look
at
the
spring
budding
out
of
hyacinths
and
tulips
suddenly
one
of
the
pair
a
figure
whose
early
season
attire
was
itself
spoke
to
the
coachman
stop
here
she
said
i
want
to
get
out
as
the
victoria
drew
up
near
a
gate
she
made
a
light
gesture
what
do
you
think
starling
she
laughed
the
very
woman
we
are
talking
about
is
sitting
in
the
gardens
there
i
know
her
perfectly
though
i
only
saw
her
portrait
at
the
academy
years
ago
yes
there
she
is
muir
you
know
she
clapped
her
hands
and
her
laugh
became
a
delighted
giggle
and
my
robin
is
playing
on
the
grass
near
her
with
a
boy
what
a
joke
it
must
be
the
boy
and
i
wanted
to
see
the
pair
together
coombe
said
could
be
done
and
more
than
anything
i
want
to
speak
to
her
let
get
out
they
got
out
and
this
was
why
helen
muir
turning
her
eyes
a
moment
from
robin
whose
hand
she
was
holding
saw
two
women
coming
towards
her
with
evident
intention
at
least
one
of
them
had
evident
intention
she
was
the
one
whose
light
attire
produced
the
effect
of
being
made
of
hyacinth
petals
because
muir
glance
turned
towards
her
robin
turned
also
she
started
a
little
and
leaned
against
muir
knee
her
eyes
growing
very
large
and
round
indeed
and
filling
with
a
sudden
worshipping
light
it
is
she
ecstatically
sighed
or
rather
gasped
the
lady
downstairs
feather
floated
near
to
the
seat
and
paused
smiling
where
is
your
nurse
robin
she
said
robin
being
always
dazzled
by
the
sight
of
her
did
not
of
course
shine
she
is
reading
under
the
tree
she
answered
tremulously
she
is
only
a
few
yards
away
said
muir
she
knows
robin
is
playing
with
my
boy
and
that
i
am
watching
them
robin
is
your
little
girl
amiably
yes
so
kind
of
you
to
let
her
play
with
your
boy
do
let
her
bore
you
i
am
mrs
there
was
a
little
silence
a
delicate
little
silence
i
recognized
you
as
muir
at
once
said
feather
unperturbed
and
smiling
brilliantly
i
saw
your
portrait
at
the
grosvenor
yes
said
muir
gently
she
had
risen
and
was
beautifully
tall
the
line
was
perfect
and
she
looked
with
a
gracious
calm
into
feather
eyes
donal
allured
by
the
hyacinth
petal
colours
drew
near
robin
made
an
unconscious
little
catch
at
his
plaid
and
whispered
something
is
this
donal
feather
said
are
you
the
lady
downstairs
please
donal
put
in
politely
because
he
wanted
so
to
know
feather
pretty
smile
ended
in
the
prettiest
of
outright
laughs
her
maid
had
told
her
andrews
story
of
the
name
yes
i
believe
that
what
she
calls
me
it
a
nice
name
for
a
mother
is
it
donal
took
a
quick
step
forward
are
you
her
mother
he
asked
eagerly
of
course
i
am
donal
quite
flushed
with
excitement
she
does
know
he
said
he
turned
on
robin
she
your
mother
you
thought
you
had
one
she
your
mother
but
i
am
the
lady
downstairs
too
feather
was
immensely
amused
she
was
not
subtle
enough
to
know
why
she
felt
a
perverse
kind
of
pleasure
in
seeing
the
scotch
woman
standing
so
still
and
that
it
led
her
into
a
touch
of
vulgarity
i
wanted
very
much
to
see
your
boy
she
said
yes
still
gently
from
muir
because
of
coombe
you
know
we
are
such
old
friends
how
queer
that
the
two
little
things
have
made
friends
too
i
did
know
i
am
so
glad
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
you
and
that
i
had
seen
the
portrait
good
morning
goodbye
children
while
she
strayed
airily
away
they
all
watched
her
she
picked
up
her
friend
the
starling
who
not
feeling
concerned
or
needed
had
paused
to
look
at
daffodils
the
children
watched
her
until
her
victoria
drove
away
the
chiffon
ruffles
of
her
flowerlike
parasol
fluttering
in
the
air
muir
had
sat
down
again
and
donal
and
robin
leaned
against
her
they
saw
she
was
not
laughing
any
more
but
they
did
not
know
that
her
eyes
had
something
like
grief
in
them
she
her
mother
donal
cried
she
lovely
too
but
she
her
mother
and
his
voice
and
face
were
equally
puzzled
robin
little
hand
delicately
touched
muir
is
she
she
faltered
helen
muir
took
her
in
her
arms
and
held
her
quite
close
she
kissed
her
yes
she
is
my
lamb
she
said
she
your
mother
she
was
clear
as
to
what
she
must
do
for
donal
sake
it
was
the
only
safe
and
sane
course
but
at
this
age
the
child
was
a
lamb
and
she
could
not
help
holding
her
close
for
a
moment
her
little
body
was
deliciously
soft
and
warm
and
the
big
silk
curls
all
in
a
heap
were
a
fragrance
against
her
breast
chapter
x
donal
talked
a
great
deal
as
he
pranced
home
feather
had
excited
as
well
as
allured
him
why
had
she
told
robin
she
was
her
mother
why
did
she
never
show
her
pictures
in
the
nursery
and
hold
her
on
her
knee
she
was
little
enough
to
be
held
on
knees
did
some
mothers
never
tell
their
children
and
did
the
children
never
find
out
this
was
what
he
wanted
to
hear
explained
he
took
the
gloved
hand
near
him
and
held
it
close
and
a
trifle
authoritatively
i
am
glad
i
know
you
are
my
mother
he
said
i
always
knew
he
was
not
sure
that
the
matter
was
explained
very
clearly
not
as
clearly
as
things
usually
were
but
he
was
not
really
disturbed
he
had
remembered
a
book
he
could
show
robin
tomorrow
and
he
thought
of
that
there
was
also
a
game
in
a
little
box
which
could
be
easily
carried
under
his
arm
his
mother
was
thinking
and
he
was
used
to
that
it
came
on
her
sometimes
and
of
his
own
volition
he
always
on
such
occasion
kept
as
quiet
as
was
humanly
possible
after
he
was
asleep
helen
sent
for
nanny
you
tired
the
woman
said
when
she
saw
her
i
afraid

afternoon

the
little
girl

have
been
playing

unlike

and
because
she
loved
her
and
knew
her
face
and
voice
nanny
watched
her
closely
you
will
be
as
startled
as
i
was
by
some
queer
chance
the
child
mother
was
driving
by
and
saw
us
and
came
in
to
speak
to
me
nanny
she
is
mrs

start

also
reddened
and

sharply

altered
and
are
altering
every
day
muir
said
society
is
not
at
all
inflexible
she
has
a
smart
set
of
her
own
and
she
is
very
pretty
and
evidently
well
provided
for
people
who
choose
to
find
explanations
suggest
that
her
husband
was
a
relation
of
lord
lawdor
and
him
a
canny
scotchman
with
a
new
child
a
year
yes

an
acrid
grimness
muir
hands
clasped
strongly
as
they
lay
on
the
table
before
her

come
within
my
bailiewick
she
said
in
her
quiet
voice
her
life
is
her
own
and
not
mine
words
are
the
wind
that
blows
she
stopped
just
a
moment
and
began
again
we
must
leave
for
scotland
by
the
earliest
train
what
he
do
the
words
escaped
from
the
woman
as
if
involuntarily
she
even
drew
a
quick
breath
he
a
strong
feeling
bairn
strong
he
be
stronger
when
he
is
a
young
man
nanny
desperately
that
is
why
i
must
act
now
there
is
no
half
way
i
do
want
to
be
hard
oh
am
i
hard
am
i
hard
she
cried
out
low
as
if
she
were
pleading
no
you
are
not
he
your
own
flesh
and
blood
nanny
had
never
before
seen
her
mistress
as
she
saw
her
in
the
next
curious
almost
exaggerated
moment
her
hand
flew
to
her
side
he
my
heart
and
my
soul
she
said
he
is
the
very
entrails
of
me
and
it
will
hurt
him
so
and
i
can
not
explain
to
him
because
he
is
too
young
to
understand
he
is
only
a
little
boy
who
must
go
where
he
is
taken
and
he
can
not
help
himself
it
unfair
nanny
was
prone
to
become
more
scotch
as
she
became
moved
but
she
still
managed
to
look
grim
he
canna
help
himsel
she
said
an
waur
still
you
canna
there
was
a
moment
of
stillness
and
then
she
said
i
must
go
and
pack
up
and
walked
out
of
the
room
donal
always
slept
like
a
young
roe
in
the
bracken
and
in
deep
and
rapturous
ease
he
slept
this
night
another
perfectly
joyful
day
had
passed
and
his
mother
had
liked
robin
and
kissed
her
all
was
well
with
the
world
as
long
as
he
had
remained
awake
and
it
had
not
been
long
he
had
thought
of
delightful
things
unfeverishly
of
robin
somehow
at
braemarnie
growing
bigger
very
quickly
big
enough
for
all
sorts
of
games
learning
to
ride
chieftain
even
to
gallop
his
mother
would
buy
another
pony
and
they
could
ride
side
by
side
robin
would
laugh
and
her
hair
would
fly
behind
her
if
they
went
fast
she
would
see
how
fast
he
could
go
she
would
see
him
make
chieftain
jump
they
would
have
picnics
catch
sight
of
deer
and
fawns
delicately
lifting
their
feet
as
they
stepped
she
would
always
look
at
him
with
that
nice
look
in
her
eyes
and
the
little
smile
which
came
and
went
in
a
second
she
was
quite
different
from
the
minister
little
girls
at
the
manse
he
liked
her
he
liked
her
he
was
wakened
by
a
light
in
his
room
and
by
the
sound
of
moving
about
he
sat
up
quickly
and
found
his
mother
standing
by
his
bed
and
nanny
putting
things
into
a
travelling
bag
he
felt
as
if
his
mother
looked
taller
than
she
had
looked
yesterday
and
almost
thin
and
her
face
was
anxious
and
shy
we
let
you
sleep
as
late
as
we
could
donal
she
said
you
must
get
up
quickly
now
and
have
breakfast
something
has
happened
we
are
obliged
to
go
back
to
scotland
by
very
early
train
there
is
not
a
minute
to
waste
at
first
he
only
said
back
yes
dear
get
up
to
braemarnie
yes
dear
laddie
he
felt
himself
grow
hot
and
cold
away
away
he
said
again
vaguely
yes
get
up
dear
he
was
as
she
had
said
only
a
little
boy
and
accustomed
to
do
as
he
was
told
he
was
also
a
fine
sturdy
little
scot
with
a
pride
of
his
own
his
breeding
had
been
of
the
sort
which
did
not
include
insubordinate
scenes
so
he
got
out
of
bed
and
began
to
dress
but
his
mother
saw
that
his
hands
shook
i
shall
not
see
robin
he
said
in
a
queer
voice
she
find
me
when
she
goes
behind
the
lilac
bushes
she
wo
know
why
i
do
come
he
swallowed
very
hard
and
was
dead
still
for
a
few
minutes
though
he
did
not
linger
over
his
dressing
his
mother
felt
that
the
whole
thing
was
horrible
he
was
acting
almost
like
a
young
man
even
now
she
did
not
know
how
she
could
bear
it
she
spoke
to
him
in
a
tone
which
was
actually
rather
humble
if
we
knew
where
she
lived
you
you
could
write
a
little
letter
and
tell
her
about
it
but
we
do
not
where
she
lives
he
answered
her
very
low
that
it
and
she
little
and
she
wo
understand
she
very
little
really
there
was
a
harrowingly
protective
note
in
his
voice
perhaps
she
cry
helen
looking
down
at
him
with
anguished
eyes
he
was
buttoning
his
shoes
made
an
unearthly
effort
to
find
words
but
as
she
said
them
she
knew
they
were
not
the
right
ones
she
will
be
disappointed
of
course
but
she
is
so
little
that
she
will
not
feel
it
as
much
as
if
she
were
bigger
she
will
get
over
it
darling
very
little
girls
do
not
remember
things
long
oh
how
coarse
and
crass
and
stupid
it
sounded
how
coarse
and
crass
and
stupid
to
say
it
to
this
small
defiant
scrap
of
what
seemed
the
inevitable
suffering
of
the
world
the
clear
blue
of
the
eyes
robin
had
dwelt
in
lifted
itself
to
her
there
was
something
almost
fierce
in
it
almost
like
impotent
hatred
of
something
she
wo
he
said
and
she
actually
heard
him
grind
his
little
teeth
after
it
he
did
not
look
like
donal
when
he
was
dressed
and
sat
at
the
breakfast
table
he
did
not
eat
much
of
his
porridge
but
she
saw
that
he
determinedly
ate
some
she
felt
several
times
as
if
he
actually
did
not
look
like
anybody
she
had
ever
seen
and
at
the
same
time
his
fair
hair
his
fair
cheeks
and
the
fair
sturdy
knees
beneath
his
swinging
kilt
made
him
seem
as
much
a
little
boy
as
she
had
ever
known
him
it
was
his
hot
blue
eyes
which
were
different
he
obeyed
her
every
wish
and
followed
where
she
led
when
the
train
laboured
out
of
the
big
station
he
had
taken
a
seat
in
a
corner
and
sat
with
his
face
turned
to
the
window
so
that
his
back
was
towards
her
he
stared
and
stared
at
the
passing
country
and
she
could
only
see
part
of
his
cheek
and
the
side
of
his
neck
she
could
not
help
watching
them
and
presently
she
saw
a
hot
red
glow
under
the
skin
as
if
a
flood
had
risen
it
subsided
in
a
few
moments
but
presently
she
saw
it
rise
again
this
happened
several
times
and
he
was
holding
his
lip
with
his
teeth
once
she
saw
his
shoulders
more
and
he
coughed
obstinately
two
or
three
times
she
knew
that
he
would
die
before
he
would
let
himself
cry
but
she
wished
he
would
descend
to
it
just
this
once
as
the
fields
and
hedges
raced
past
and
he
was
carried
away
away
it
might
be
that
it
was
all
his
manhood
she
was
saving
for
him
he
really
made
her
heart
stand
still
for
a
moment
just
as
she
was
thinking
this
and
saying
it
to
herself
almost
fiercely
he
suddenly
turned
on
her
the
blue
of
his
eyes
was
flaming
and
the
tide
had
risen
again
in
his
cheeks
and
neck
it
was
a
thing
like
rage
she
saw
before
her
a
child
rage
and
impotently
fierce
he
cried
out
as
if
he
were
ending
a
sentence
he
had
not
finished
when
he
spoke
as
he
sat
on
the
floor
buttoning
his
shoes
she
has
no
one
but
me
to
remember
he
said
no
one
but
me
had
ever
even
kissed
her
she
did
know
to
her
amazement
he
clenched
both
his
savage
young
fists
and
shook
them
before
him
it
kill
me
he
raged
she
could
not
hold
herself
back
she
caught
at
him
with
her
arms
and
meant
to
drag
him
to
her
breast
no
no
donal
she
cried
darling
no
no
but
as
suddenly
as
the
queer
unchildish
thing
had
broken
out
did
he
remember
himself
and
boy
shame
at
his
fantastic
emotion
overtook
him
he
had
never
spoken
like
that
to
anyone
before
it
was
almost
as
bad
as
bursting
out
crying
the
red
tide
ebbed
away
and
he
withdrew
himself
awkwardly
from
her
embrace
he
said
not
another
word
and
sat
down
in
his
corner
with
his
back
turned
toward
the
world
that
the
lady
downstairs
who
was
so
fond
of
laughing
and
who
knew
so
many
persons
who
seemed
to
laugh
nearly
all
the
time
might
have
been
joking
about
being
her
mother
presented
itself
to
robin
as
a
vague
solution
of
the
problem
the
lady
had
laughed
when
she
said
it
as
people
so
often
laughed
at
children
perhaps
she
had
only
been
amusing
herself
as
persons
were
apparently
entitled
to
do
even
donal
had
not
seemed
wholly
convinced
and
though
his
mother
had
said
the
lady
downstairs
was
somehow
the
subject
had
been
changed
at
once
muir
had
so
soon
begun
to
tell
them
a
story
robin
was
not
in
the
least
aware
that
she
had
swiftly
distracted
their
attention
from
a
question
any
discussion
of
which
would
have
involved
explanations
she
could
not
have
produced
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
make
it
clear
to
any
child
she
herself
was
helpless
before
the
situation
and
therefore
her
only
refuge
was
to
make
the
two
think
of
other
things
she
had
so
well
done
this
that
robin
had
gone
home
later
only
remembering
the
brightly
transitory
episode
as
she
recalled
others
as
brief
and
bright
when
she
had
stared
at
a
light
and
lovely
figure
standing
on
the
nursery
threshold
and
asking
careless
questions
of
andrews
without
coming
in
and
risking
the
freshness
of
her
draperies
by
contact
with
london
grubbiness
the
child
was
in
fact
too
full
of
the
reality
of
her
happiness
with
donal
and
mother
to
be
more
than
faintly
bewildered
by
a
sort
of
visionary
conundrum
robin
like
donal
slept
perfectly
through
the
night
her
sleep
was
perhaps
made
more
perfect
by
fair
dreams
in
which
she
played
in
the
gardens
and
she
and
donal
ran
to
and
from
the
knees
of
the
mother
lady
to
ask
questions
and
explain
their
games
as
the
child
had
often
in
the
past
looked
up
at
the
sky
so
she
had
looked
up
into
the
clear
eyes
of
the
mother
lady
there
was
something
in
them
which
she
had
never
seen
before
but
which
she
kept
wanting
to
see
again
then
there
came
a
queer
bit
of
a
dream
about
the
lady
downstairs
she
came
dancing
towards
them
dressed
in
hyacinths
and
with
her
arms
full
of
daffodils
she
danced
before
mother
danced
and
laughed
as
if
she
thought
they
were
all
funny
she
threw
a
few
daffodils
at
them
and
then
danced
away
the
daffodils
lay
on
the
gravel
walk
and
they
all
looked
at
them
but
no
one
picked
them
up
afterwards
in
the
dream
muir
suddenly
caught
her
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
and
robin
was
glad
and
felt
warm
all
over
inside
and
out
she
wakened
smiling
at
the
dingy
ceiling
of
the
dingy
room
there
was
but
one
tiny
shadow
in
the
world
which
was
the
fear
that
andrews
would
get
well
too
quickly
she
was
no
longer
in
bed
but
was
well
enough
to
sit
up
and
sew
a
little
before
the
tiny
fire
in
the
atom
of
a
servant
room
grate
the
doctor
would
not
let
her
go
out
yet
therefore
anne
still
remained
in
charge
founding
one
hope
on
previous
knowledge
of
anne
habits
she
might
be
trusted
to
sit
and
read
and
show
no
untoward
curiosity
from
her
bed
robin
could
see
the
sky
was
blue
that
meant
that
she
would
be
taken
out
she
lay
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
and
thought
of
the
joy
before
her
until
anne
came
to
dress
her
and
give
her
her
breakfast
we
put
on
your
smock
this
morning
the
girl
said
when
the
dressing
began
i
like
the
hat
and
socks
that
match
anne
was
not
quite
like
andrews
who
was
not
talkative
she
made
a
conversational
sort
of
remark
after
she
had
tied
the
white
shoes
you
got
pretty
little
aristocratic
legs
of
your
own
she
said
amiably
i
like
my
children
to
have
nice
legs
robin
was
uplifted
in
spirit
by
the
commendation
but
she
hoped
anne
would
put
on
her
own
things
quickly
sometimes
she
was
rather
a
long
time
the
one
course
however
towards
which
discretion
pointed
as
entirely
safe
was
the
continuance
of
being
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
even
quieter
if
such
thing
might
be
so
that
nothing
might
interfere
with
anything
any
one
wanted
to
do
to
interfere
would
have
been
to
attract
attention
and
might
lead
to
delay
so
she
stood
and
watched
the
sparrows
inoffensively
until
anne
called
her
when
she
found
herself
out
on
the
street
her
step
was
so
light
on
the
pavement
that
she
was
rather
like
a
rose
petal
blown
fluttering
along
by
soft
vagrant
puffs
of
spring
air
under
her
flopping
hat
her
eyes
and
lips
and
cheeks
were
so
happy
that
more
than
one
turned
head
over
shoulder
to
look
after
her
your
name
ought
to
be
rose
anne
giggled
involuntarily
as
she
glanced
down
at
her
because
someone
had
stared
she
had
not
meant
to
speak
but
the
words
said
themselves
because
the
time
was
young
june
even
london
sky
and
air
were
wonderful
stray
breaths
of
fragrance
came
and
went
the
green
of
the
trees
in
the
gardens
was
light
and
fresh
and
in
the
curves
and
stars
and
circles
there
were
more
flowers
every
hour
so
that
it
seemed
as
if
blooming
things
with
scents
grew
thick
about
one
feet
it
was
no
wonder
one
felt
light
and
smiled
back
at
nurses
and
governesses
who
looked
up
robin
drew
eyes
became
she
was
like
a
summer
bloom
suddenly
appearing
in
the
spring
garden
nanny
was
not
sitting
on
the
bench
near
the
gate
and
donal
was
not
to
be
seen
amusing
himself
but
he
was
somewhere
just
out
of
sight
or
if
he
had
chanced
to
be
late
he
would
come
very
soon
even
if
his
mother
could
not
come
with
him
though
robin
could
not
believe
she
would
not
to
a
child
thing
both
happiness
and
despair
can
not
be
conceived
of
except
as
lasting
forever
anne
sat
down
and
opened
her
book
she
had
reached
an
exciting
part
and
looked
forward
to
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
morning
robin
hopped
about
for
a
few
minutes
donal
had
taught
her
to
hop
and
she
felt
it
an
accomplishment
entangled
in
the
meshes
of
the
feathery
golden
if
criminal
ringlets
of
lady
audley
anne
did
not
know
when
she
hopped
round
the
curve
of
the
walk
behind
the
lilac
and
snowball
bushes
once
safe
in
her
bit
of
enchanted
land
the
child
stood
still
and
looked
about
her
there
was
no
kilted
figure
to
be
seen
but
it
would
come
towards
her
soon
with
swinging
plaid
and
eagle
feather
standing
up
grandly
in
its
highland
bonnet
he
would
come
soon
perhaps
he
would
come
running
and
the
mother
lady
would
walk
behind
more
slowly
and
smile
robin
waited
and
looked
she
waited
and
looked
she
was
used
to
waiting
but
she
had
never
watched
for
anyone
before
there
had
never
been
any
one
or
anything
to
watch
for
the
newness
of
the
suspense
gave
it
a
sort
of
deep
thrill
at
first
how
long
was
at
first
she
did
not
know
she
stood
and
stood
and
stood
and
looked
at
every
creature
who
entered
the
gate
she
did
not
see
any
one
who
looked
in
the
least
like
donal
or
his
mother
or
nanny
there
were
nurses
and
governesses
and
children
and
a
loitering
lady
or
two
there
were
never
many
people
in
the
gardens
only
those
who
had
keys
she
knew
nothing
about
time
but
at
length
she
knew
that
on
other
mornings
they
had
been
playing
together
before
this
the
small
figure
stood
so
still
for
so
long
that
it
began
to
look
rigid
and
a
nurse
sitting
at
some
distance
said
to
another
what
is
that
child
waiting
for
what
length
of
time
had
passed
before
she
found
herself
looking
slowly
down
at
her
feet
because
of
something
the
something
which
had
drawn
her
eyes
downward
was
that
she
had
stood
so
long
without
moving
that
her
tense
feet
had
begun
vaguely
to
hurt
her
and
the
ache
attracted
her
attention
she
changed
her
position
slightly
and
turned
her
eyes
upon
the
gate
again
he
was
coming
very
soon
he
would
be
sure
to
run
fast
now
and
he
would
be
laughing
donal
donal
she
even
laughed
a
little
low
quivering
laugh
herself
what
is
that
child
waiting
for
i
should
really
like
to
know
the
distant
nurse
said
again
curiously
if
she
had
been
eighteen
years
old
she
would
have
said
to
herself
that
she
was
waiting
hours
and
hours
she
would
have
looked
at
a
little
watch
a
thousand
times
she
would
have
walked
up
and
down
and
round
and
round
the
garden
never
losing
sight
of
the
gate
or
any
other
point
for
that
matter
for
more
than
a
minute
each
sound
of
the
church
clock
striking
a
few
streets
away
would
have
brought
her
young
heart
thumping
into
her
throat
but
a
child
has
no
watch
no
words
out
of
which
to
build
hopes
and
fears
and
reasons
arguments
battling
against
anguish
which
grows
palliations
excuses
robin
could
only
wait
in
the
midst
of
a
slow
dark
rising
tide
of
something
she
had
no
name
for
this
slow
rising
of
an
engulfing
flood
she
felt
when
pins
and
needles
began
to
take
possession
of
her
feet
when
her
legs
ached
and
her
eyes
felt
as
if
they
had
grown
big
and
tightly
strained
donal
donal
donal
who
knows
but
that
some
echo
of
the
terror
against
which
she
had
fought
and
screamed
on
the
night
when
she
had
lain
alone
in
the
dark
in
her
cradle
and
feather
had
hid
her
head
under
the
pillow
came
back
and
closed
slowly
around
and
over
her
filling
her
inarticulate
being
with
panic
which
at
last
reached
its
unbearable
height
she
had
not
really
stood
waiting
the
entire
morning
but
she
was
young
enough
to
think
that
she
had
and
that
at
any
moment
anne
might
come
and
take
her
away
he
had
not
come
running
he
had
not
come
laughing
he
had
not
come
with
his
plaid
swinging
and
his
feather
standing
high
there
came
a
moment
when
her
strained
eyes
no
longer
seemed
to
see
clearly
something
like
a
big
lump
crawled
up
into
her
throat
something
of
the
same
sort
happened
the
day
she
had
burst
into
a
wail
of
loneliness
and
andrews
had
pinched
her
panic
seized
her
she
clutched
the
breast
of
her
frock
and
turned
and
fled
into
a
thick
clump
of
bushes
where
there
was
no
path
and
where
even
donal
had
never
pierced
that
child
has
run
away
at
last
the
distant
nurse
remarked
i
like
to
find
out
what
she
was
waiting
for
the
shrubs
were
part
of
the
enclosing
planting
of
the
gardens
the
children
who
came
to
play
on
the
grass
and
paths
felt
as
if
they
formed
a
sort
of
forest
because
of
this
robin
had
made
her
frantic
dash
to
their
shelter
no
one
would
come
no
one
would
see
her
no
one
would
hear
her
beneath
them
it
was
almost
dark
bereft
broken
and
betrayed
a
little
mad
thing
she
pushed
her
way
into
their
shadow
and
threw
herself
face
downward
a
small
writhing
heap
upon
the
damp
mould
she
could
not
have
explained
what
she
was
doing
or
why
she
had
given
up
all
as
if
some
tidal
wave
had
overwhelmed
her
suddenly
she
knew
that
all
her
new
world
had
gone
forever
and
ever
as
it
had
come
so
it
had
gone
as
she
had
not
doubted
the
permanence
of
its
joy
so
she
knew
that
the
end
had
come
only
the
wisdom
of
the
occult
would
dare
to
suggest
that
from
her
child
mate
squaring
his
sturdy
young
shoulders
against
the
world
as
the
flying
train
sped
on
its
way
some
wave
of
desperate
inchoate
thinking
rushed
backward
there
was
nothing
more
he
would
not
come
back
running
he
was
gone
there
was
no
andrews
to
hear
hidden
in
the
shadow
under
the
shrubs
the
rattle
and
roar
of
the
street
outside
the
railing
drowned
her
mad
little
cries
all
she
had
never
done
before
she
did
then
her
hands
beat
on
the
damp
mould
and
tore
at
it
her
small
feet
beat
it
and
dug
into
it
she
cried
she
sobbed
the
big
lump
in
her
throat
almost
strangled
her
she
writhed
and
did
not
know
she
was
writhing
her
tears
pouring
forth
wet
her
hair
her
face
her
dress
she
did
not
cry
out
donal
donal
because
he
was
nowhere
nowhere
if
andrews
had
seen
her
she
would
have
said
she
was
in
a
tantrum
but
she
was
not
the
world
had
been
torn
away
a
long
time
afterwards
as
it
seemed
to
her
she
crawled
out
from
under
the
shrubs
carrying
her
pretty
flopping
hat
in
her
hand
it
was
not
pretty
any
more
she
had
been
lying
on
it
and
it
was
crushed
and
flat
she
crept
slowly
round
the
curve
to
anne
seeing
her
anne
sprang
to
her
feet
the
rose
was
a
piteous
thing
beaten
to
earth
by
a
storm
the
child
face
was
swollen
and
stained
her
hair
was
tangled
and
damp
there
were
dark
marks
of
mould
on
her
dress
her
hat
her
hands
her
white
cheeks
her
white
shoes
were
also
and
the
feet
in
the
socks
dragged
themselves
heavily
slowly
my
gracious
the
young
woman
almost
shrieked
what
happened
where
have
you
been
did
you
fall
down
ah
my
good
gracious
mercy
me
robin
caught
her
breath
but
did
not
say
a
word
you
fell
down
on
a
flower
bed
where
they
been
watering
the
plants
almost
wept
anne
you
must
have
there
is
that
much
dirt
anywhere
else
in
the
gardens
and
when
she
took
her
charge
home
that
was
the
story
she
told
andrews
out
of
robin
she
could
get
nothing
and
it
was
necessary
to
have
an
explanation
the
truth
of
which
she
knew
nothing
was
but
the
story
of
a
awful
dismay
and
a
child
woe
at
one
of
life
first
betrayals
it
would
be
left
behind
by
the
days
which
came
and
went
it
would
pass
as
all
things
pass
but
the
everlasting
hills
but
in
this
way
it
was
that
it
came
and
wrote
itself
upon
the
tablets
of
a
day
chapter
xi
the
child
always
been
well
andrews
was
standing
the
image
of
exact
correctness
in
her
mistress
bedroom
while
feather
lay
in
bed
with
her
breakfast
on
a
convenient
and
decorative
little
table
it
been
a
thing
i
prided
myself
on
but
i
should
say
she
is
well
now
well
i
suppose
it
only
natural
that
she
should
begin
sometime
remarked
feather
they
always
do
of
course
i
remember
we
all
had
things
when
we
were
children
what
does
the
doctor
say
i
hope
it
is
the
measles
or
the
beginning
of
anything
worse
no
it
is
it
nothing
like
a
child
disease
i
could
have
managed
that
there
good
private
nursing
homes
for
them
in
these
days
everything
taken
care
of
exactly
as
it
should
be
and
no
trouble
of
disinfecting
and
isolating
for
the
family
i
know
what
you
have
wished
to
have
done
you
do
know
your
business
andrews
was
feather
amiable
comment
thank
you
from
andrews
infectious
things
are
easy
managed
if
they
taken
away
quick
but
the
doctor
said
you
must
be
spoken
to
because
perhaps
a
change
was
needed
you
could
take
her
to
ramsgate
or
somewhere
bracing
said
feather
but
what
did
he
say
he
seemed
puzzled
that
what
struck
me
when
i
told
him
about
her
not
eating
and
lying
awake
crying
all
night
to
judge
from
her
looks
in
the
morning
and
getting
thin
and
pale
he
examined
her
very
careful
and
he
looked
queer
and
he
said
child
had
a
shock
of
any
kind
has
she
this
looks
like
what
we
should
call
shock
if
she
were
older
feather
laughed
how
could
a
baby
like
that
have
a
shock
that
what
i
thought
myself
answered
andrews
a
child
that
had
her
hours
regular
and
is
fed
and
bathed
and
sleeps
by
the
clock
and
goes
out
and
plays
by
herself
in
the
gardens
well
watched
over
has
any
chance
to
get
shocks
i
told
him
so
and
he
sat
still
and
watched
her
quite
curious
and
then
he
said
very
slow
little
children
are
a
good
deal
shaken
up
by
a
fall
when
they
are
playing
do
you
remember
any
chance
fall
when
she
cried
a
good
deal
but
you
did
of
course
said
feather
no
i
did
i
keep
my
eye
on
her
pretty
strict
and
should
encourage
wild
running
or
playing
i
do
let
her
play
with
other
children
and
she
not
one
of
those
stumbling
falling
children
i
told
him
the
only
fall
i
ever
knew
of
her
having
was
a
bit
of
a
slip
on
a
soft
flower
bed
that
had
just
been
watered
to
judge
from
the
state
her
clothes
were
in
she
had
cried
because
she
not
used
to
such
things
and
i
think
she
was
frightened
but
there
was
a
scratch
or
a
shadow
of
a
bruise
on
her
even
that
would
have
happened
if
i
been
with
her
it
was
when
i
was
ill
and
my
sister
anne
took
my
place
ann
thought
at
first
that
she
been
playing
with
a
little
boy
she
had
made
friends
with
but
she
found
out
that
the
boy
had
come
that
morning
a
boy
andrews
was
sharp
enough
to
detect
a
new
and
interested
note
what
boy
she
would
have
played
with
any
other
child
if
i
been
there
said
andrews
i
was
pretty
sharp
with
anne
about
it
but
she
said
he
was
an
aristocratic
looking
little
fellow
was
he
in
highland
costume
feather
interrupted
yes
anne
excused
herself
by
saying
she
thought
you
must
know
something
about
him
she
declares
she
saw
you
come
into
the
gardens
and
speak
to
his
mother
quite
friendly
that
was
the
day
before
robin
fell
and
ruined
her
smock
and
things
but
it
was
through
playing
boisterous
with
the
boy
because
he
did
come
that
morning
as
i
said
and
he
never
has
since
andrews
on
this
found
cause
for
being
momentarily
puzzled
by
the
change
of
expression
in
her
mistress
face
was
it
an
odd
little
gleam
of
angry
spite
she
saw
and
never
has
since
has
he
said
with
a
half
laugh
not
once
answered
andrews
and
anne
thinks
it
queer
the
child
never
seemed
to
look
for
him
as
if
she
lost
interest
she
just
droops
and
drags
about
and
does
try
to
play
at
all
how
much
did
she
play
with
him
well
he
was
such
a
fine
little
fellow
and
had
such
a
respectable
elderly
scotch
looking
woman
in
charge
of
him
that
anne
owned
up
that
she
had
thought
there
was
any
objections
to
them
playing
together
she
says
they
were
as
well
behaved
and
quiet
as
children
could
be
andrews
thought
proper
to
further
justify
herself
by
repeating
she
did
think
there
could
be
any
objection
there
could
remarked
i
do
know
the
boy
he
is
a
relation
of
lord
coombe
indeed
with
colourless
civility
anne
said
he
was
a
big
handsome
child
feather
took
a
small
bunch
of
hothouse
grapes
from
her
breakfast
tray
and
after
picking
one
off
suddenly
began
to
laugh
good
gracious
andrews
she
said
he
was
the
how
perfectly
ridiculous
robin
had
never
played
with
a
boy
before
and
she
fell
in
love
with
him
the
little
thing
actually
pining
away
for
him
she
dropped
the
grapes
and
gave
herself
up
to
delicate
mirth
he
was
taken
away
and
disappeared
perhaps
she
fainted
and
fell
into
the
wet
flower
bed
and
spoiled
her
frock
when
she
first
realized
that
he
was
coming
it
did
happen
that
morning
admitted
andrews
smiling
a
little
also
it
does
seem
funny
but
children
take
to
each
other
in
a
queer
way
now
and
then
i
seen
it
upset
them
dreadful
when
they
were
parted
you
must
tell
the
doctor
laughed
feather
then
he
see
there
nothing
to
be
anxious
about
she
get
over
it
in
a
week
it
five
weeks
since
it
happened
remarked
andrews
with
just
a
touch
of
seriousness
five
why
so
it
must
be
i
remember
the
day
i
spoke
to
muir
if
she
that
sort
of
child
you
had
better
keep
her
away
from
boys
how
ridiculous
how
lord
coombe
how
people
will
laugh
when
i
tell
them
she
had
paused
a
second
because
for
that
second
she
was
not
quite
sure
that
coombe
would
laugh
frequently
she
was
of
the
opinion
that
he
did
not
laugh
at
things
when
he
should
have
done
so
but
she
had
had
a
brief
furious
moment
when
she
had
realized
that
the
boy
had
actually
been
whisked
away
she
remembered
the
clearness
of
the
fine
eyes
which
had
looked
directly
into
hers
the
woman
had
been
deciding
then
that
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
or
even
with
her
child
but
the
story
of
robin
worn
by
a
bereft
nursery
passion
for
a
little
boy
whose
mamma
snatched
him
away
as
a
brand
from
the
burning
was
far
too
edifying
not
to
be
related
to
those
who
would
find
it
delicious
it
was
on
the
occasion
a
night
or
so
later
of
a
gathering
at
dinner
of
exactly
the
few
elect
ones
whose
power
to
find
it
delicious
was
the
most
highly
developed
that
she
related
it
it
was
a
very
little
dinner
only
four
people
one
was
the
long
thin
young
man
with
the
good
looking
narrow
face
and
dark
eyes
peering
through
a
pince
nez
the
one
who
had
said
that
got
her
wondrous
clothes
from
helene
but
that
he
could
his
name
was
harrowby
another
was
the
starling
who
was
a
miss
march
who
had
some
years
earlier
led
the
van
of
the
girls
who
prostrated
their
relatives
by
becoming
what
was
then
called
emancipated
the
sign
thereof
being
the
demanding
of
latchkeys
and
the
setting
up
of
bachelor
apartments
the
relatives
had
astonishingly
settled
down
with
the
unmoved
passage
of
time
and
more
modern
emancipation
had
so
far
left
latchkeys
and
bachelor
apartments
behind
it
that
they
began
to
seem
almost
clara
march
however
had
progressed
with
her
day
the
third
diner
was
an
adored
young
actor
with
a
low
veiled
voice
which
combining
itself
with
almond
eyes
and
a
sentimental
and
emotional
curve
of
cheek
and
chin
made
the
most
commonplace
lines
sound
yearningly
impassioned
he
was
not
impassioned
at
all
merely
fond
of
his
pleasures
and
comforts
in
a
way
which
would
end
by
his
becoming
stout
at
present
his
figure
was
perfect
exactly
the
thing
for
the
uniforms
of
royal
persons
of
ruritania
and
places
of
that
ilk
and
the
name
by
which
programmes
presented
him
was
gerald
vesey
feather
house
pleased
him
and
she
herself
liked
being
spoken
to
in
the
veiled
voice
and
gazed
at
by
the
almond
eyes
as
though
insuperable
obstacles
alone
prevented
things
from
being
said
that
she
knew
this
was
not
true
did
not
interfere
with
her
liking
it
besides
he
adored
and
understood
her
clothes
over
coffee
in
the
coombe
joined
them
he
had
not
known
of
the
little
dinner
and
arrived
just
as
feather
was
on
the
point
of
beginning
her
story
you
are
just
in
time
she
greeted
him
i
was
going
to
tell
them
something
to
make
them
laugh
will
it
make
me
laugh
he
inquired
it
ought
to
robin
is
in
love
she
is
five
years
old
and
she
has
been
deserted
and
andrews
came
to
tell
me
that
she
can
neither
eat
nor
sleep
the
doctor
says
she
has
had
a
shock
coombe
did
not
join
in
the
ripple
of
amused
laughter
but
as
he
took
his
cup
of
coffee
he
looked
interested
harrowby
was
interested
too
his
dark
eyes
quite
gleamed
i
suppose
she
is
in
bed
by
now
he
said
if
it
were
not
so
late
i
should
beg
you
to
have
her
brought
down
so
that
we
might
have
a
look
at
her
i
by
way
of
taking
a
psychological
interest
i
psychological
myself
said
the
starling
but
what
do
you
mean
feather
are
you
in
earnest
andrews
is
feather
answered
she
could
manage
measles
but
she
could
not
be
responsible
for
shock
but
she
did
find
out
about
the
love
affair
i
found
that
out
by
mere
chance
do
you
remember
the
day
we
got
out
of
the
victoria
and
went
into
the
gardens
starling
the
time
you
spoke
to
mrs
muir
coombe
turned
slightly
towards
them
feather
nodded
with
a
lightly
significant
air
it
was
her
boy
she
said
and
then
she
laughed
and
nodded
at
coombe
he
was
quite
as
handsome
as
you
said
he
was
no
wonder
poor
robin
fell
prostrate
he
ought
to
be
chained
and
muzzled
by
law
when
he
grows
up
but
so
ought
robin
threw
in
the
starling
in
her
brusque
young
mannish
way
but
robin
only
a
girl
and
she
not
a
parti
laughed
feather
her
eyes
lifted
to
coombe
held
a
sort
of
childlike
malice
after
his
mother
knew
she
was
miss
he
was
not
allowed
to
play
in
the
gardens
again
did
she
take
him
back
to
scotland
they
went
back
to
scotland
answered
coombe
and
of
course
the
boy
was
not
left
behind
have
you
a
child
five
years
old
asked
vesey
in
his
low
voice
of
feather
you
it
seems
absurd
to
me
said
feather
i
never
quite
believe
in
her
i
do
said
vesey
she
impossible
robin
is
a
stimulating
name
put
in
harrowby
is
it
too
late
to
let
us
see
her
if
she
such
a
beauty
as
starling
hints
she
ought
to
be
looked
at
feather
actually
touched
the
bell
by
the
fireplace
a
sudden
caprice
moved
her
the
love
story
had
not
gone
off
quite
as
well
as
she
had
thought
it
would
and
after
all
the
child
was
pretty
enough
to
show
off
she
knew
nothing
in
particular
about
her
daughter
hours
but
if
she
was
asleep
she
could
be
wakened
tell
andrews
she
said
to
the
footman
when
he
appeared
i
wish
miss
robin
to
be
brought
downstairs
they
usually
go
to
bed
at
seven
i
believe
remarked
coombe
but
of
course
i
am
not
an
authority
robin
was
not
asleep
though
she
had
long
been
in
bed
because
she
kept
her
eyes
shut
andrews
had
been
deceived
into
carrying
on
a
conversation
with
her
sister
anne
who
had
come
to
see
her
robin
had
been
lying
listening
to
it
she
had
begun
to
listen
because
they
had
been
talking
about
the
day
she
had
spoiled
her
smock
and
they
had
ended
by
being
very
frank
about
other
things
as
sure
as
you
saw
her
speak
to
the
boy
mother
the
day
before
just
so
sure
she
whisked
him
back
to
scotland
the
next
morning
said
andrews
she
one
of
the
kind
that
particular
lord
coombe
the
reason
she
does
not
want
her
boy
to
see
or
speak
to
him
if
it
can
be
helped
she
wo
have
it
and
when
she
found
out
is
lord
coombe
as
bad
as
they
say
put
in
anne
with
bated
breath
he
must
be
pretty
bad
if
a
boy
that
eight
years
old
has
to
be
kept
out
of
sight
and
sound
of
him
so
it
was
lord
coombe
who
had
somehow
done
it
he
had
made
mother
take
him
away
it
was
lord
coombe
who
was
lord
coombe
it
was
because
he
was
wicked
that
donal
mother
would
not
let
him
play
with
her
because
he
was
wicked
all
at
once
there
came
to
her
a
memory
of
having
heard
his
name
before
she
had
heard
it
several
times
in
the
basement
servants
hall
and
though
she
had
not
understood
what
was
said
about
him
she
had
felt
the
atmosphere
of
cynical
disapproval
of
something
they
had
said
him
and
her
as
if
he
somehow
belonged
to
the
house
on
one
occasion
he
had
been
high
in
the
manner
of
some
reproof
to
jennings
who
being
enraged
freely
expressed
his
opinions
of
his
lordship
character
and
general
reputation
the
impression
made
on
robin
then
had
been
that
he
was
a
person
to
be
condemned
severely
that
the
condemnation
was
the
mere
outcome
of
the
temper
of
an
impudent
young
footman
had
not
conveyed
itself
to
her
and
it
was
the
impression
which
came
back
to
her
now
with
a
new
significance
he
was
the
cause
not
donal
not
donal
mother
but
this
man
who
was
so
bad
that
servants
were
angry
because
he
was
somehow
connected
with
the
house
as
to
his
badness
she
heard
andrews
answer
there
some
that
ca
say
enough
against
him
badness
is
smart
these
days
bad
enough
for
the
boy
mother
to
take
him
away
from
it
what
he
is
in
this
house
that
does
it
she
wo
have
her
boy
playing
with
a
child
like
robin
then
even
as
there
flashed
upon
her
bewilderment
this
strange
revelation
of
her
own
unfitness
for
association
with
boys
whose
mothers
took
care
of
them
jennings
the
young
footman
came
to
the
door
is
she
awake
miss
andrews
he
said
looking
greatly
edified
by
andrews
astonished
countenance
what
on
earth
began
andrews
if
she
is
jennings
winked
humorously
she
to
be
dressed
up
and
taken
down
to
the
to
be
shown
off
i
do
know
whether
it
coombe
idea
or
not
he
there
robin
eyes
flew
wide
open
she
forgot
to
keep
them
shut
she
was
to
go
downstairs
who
wanted
her
who
andrews
had
quite
gasped
here
a
new
break
out
she
exclaimed
i
never
heard
such
a
thing
in
my
life
she
been
in
bed
over
two
hours
i
like
to
know
she
paused
here
because
her
glance
at
the
bed
met
the
dark
liquidity
of
eyes
wide
open
she
got
up
and
walked
across
the
room
you
are
awake
she
said
you
look
as
if
you
had
been
asleep
at
all
you
to
get
up
and
have
your
frock
put
on
the
lady
downstairs
wants
you
in
the
two
months
earlier
such
a
piece
of
information
would
have
awakened
in
the
child
a
delirium
of
delight
but
now
her
vitality
was
lowered
because
her
previously
unawakened
little
soul
had
soared
so
high
and
been
so
dashed
down
to
cruel
earth
again
the
brilliancy
of
the
lady
downstairs
had
been
dimmed
as
a
candle
is
dimmed
by
the
light
of
the
sun
she
felt
only
a
vague
wonder
as
she
did
as
andrews
told
her
wonder
at
the
strangeness
of
getting
up
to
be
dressed
as
it
seemed
to
her
in
the
middle
of
the
night
it
just
the
kind
of
thing
that
would
happen
in
a
house
like
this
grumbled
andrews
as
she
put
on
her
frock
just
anything
that
comes
into
their
heads
they
think
they
a
right
to
do
i
suppose
they
have
too
if
you
rich
and
aristocratic
enough
to
have
your
own
way
why
not
take
it
i
would
myself
the
big
silk
curls
all
in
a
heap
fell
almost
to
the
child
hips
the
frock
andrews
chose
for
her
was
a
fairy
thing
she
is
a
bit
thin
to
be
sure
said
the
girl
anne
but
it
points
her
little
face
and
makes
her
eyes
look
bigger
if
her
mother
got
a
marquis
i
wonder
what
she
get
said
andrews
she
got
a
lot
before
her
this
one
when
the
child
entered
the
andrews
made
her
go
in
alone
while
she
held
herself
properly
a
few
paces
back
like
a
lady
in
waiting
the
room
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
seemed
full
of
colour
and
people
who
were
laughing
there
were
pretty
things
crowding
each
other
everywhere
and
there
were
flowers
on
all
sides
the
lady
downstairs
in
a
sheathlike
sparkling
dress
and
only
a
glittering
strap
seeming
to
hold
it
on
over
her
fair
undressed
shoulders
was
talking
to
a
tall
thin
man
standing
before
the
fireplace
with
a
gold
cup
of
coffee
in
his
hand
as
the
little
thing
strayed
in
with
her
rather
rigid
attendant
behind
her
suddenly
the
laughing
ceased
and
everybody
involuntarily
drew
a
half
startled
breath
everybody
but
the
tall
thin
man
who
quietly
turned
and
set
his
coffee
cup
down
on
the
mantel
piece
behind
him
is
this
what
you
have
been
keeping
up
your
sleeve
said
harrowby
settling
his
pince
nez
i
told
you
said
the
starling
you
could
tell
us
vesey
veiled
voice
dropped
in
softly
it
must
be
seen
to
be
believed
but
still
aside
to
feather
i
do
believe
it
enter
my
only
child
said
feather
come
here
robin
come
to
your
mother
now
was
the
time
robin
went
to
her
and
took
hold
of
a
very
small
piece
of
her
sparkling
dress
are
you
my
mother
she
said
and
then
everybody
burst
into
a
peal
of
laughter
feather
with
the
rest
she
calls
me
the
lady
downstairs
she
said
i
really
believe
she
does
know
she
rather
a
stupid
little
thing
amazing
lack
of
filial
affection
said
lord
coombe
he
was
not
laughing
like
the
rest
and
he
was
looking
down
at
robin
she
thought
him
ugly
and
wicked
looking
vesey
and
harrowby
were
beautiful
by
contrast
before
she
knew
who
he
was
she
disliked
him
she
looked
at
him
askance
under
her
eyelashes
and
he
saw
her
do
it
before
her
mother
spoke
his
name
taking
her
by
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
leading
her
to
him
come
and
let
lord
coombe
look
at
you
she
said
so
it
revealed
itself
to
her
that
it
was
he
this
ugly
one
who
had
done
it
and
hatred
surged
up
in
her
soul
it
was
actually
in
the
eyes
she
raised
to
his
face
and
coombe
saw
it
as
he
had
seen
the
sidelong
glance
and
he
wondered
what
it
meant
shake
hands
with
lord
coombe
feather
instructed
if
you
can
make
a
curtsey
make
one
she
turned
her
head
over
her
shoulders
have
you
taught
her
to
curtsey
andrews
but
andrews
had
not
and
secretly
lost
temper
at
finding
herself
made
to
figure
as
a
nurse
who
had
been
capable
of
omission
outwardly
she
preserved
rigid
calm
i
afraid
not
i
will
at
once
if
you
wish
it
coombe
was
watching
the
inner
abhorrence
in
the
little
face
robin
had
put
her
hand
behind
her
back
she
who
had
never
disobeyed
since
she
was
born
she
had
crossed
a
line
of
development
when
she
had
seen
glimpses
of
the
new
world
through
donal
eyes
what
are
you
doing
you
silly
little
thing
feather
reproved
her
shake
hands
with
lord
coombe
robin
shook
her
head
fiercely
no
no
no
no
she
protested
feather
was
disgusted
this
was
not
the
kind
of
child
to
display
rude
little
thing
andrews
come
and
make
her
do
it
or
take
her
upstairs
she
said
coombe
took
his
gold
coffee
cup
from
the
mantel
she
regards
me
with
marked
antipathy
as
she
did
when
she
first
saw
me
he
summed
the
matter
up
children
and
animals
do
hate
one
without
reason
it
is
some
remote
iniquity
in
my
character
which
the
rest
of
us
have
not
yet
detected
to
robin
he
said
i
do
not
want
to
shake
hands
with
you
if
you
object
i
prefer
to
drink
my
coffee
out
of
this
beautiful
cup
but
andrews
was
seething
having
no
conscience
whatever
she
had
instead
the
pride
of
a
female
devil
in
her
perfection
in
her
professional
duties
that
the
child
she
was
responsible
for
should
stamp
her
with
ignominious
by
conducting
herself
with
as
small
grace
as
an
infant
costermonger
was
more
than
her
special
order
of
flesh
and
blood
could
bear
and
yet
she
must
outwardly
control
the
flesh
and
blood
in
obedience
to
her
mistress
command
she
crossed
the
room
and
bent
down
and
whispered
to
robin
she
intended
that
her
countenance
should
remain
but
when
she
lifted
her
head
she
met
coombe
eyes
and
realized
that
perhaps
it
had
not
she
added
to
her
whisper
nursery
instructions
in
a
voice
of
sugar
be
pretty
mannered
miss
robin
my
dear
and
shake
hands
with
his
lordship
each
person
in
the
little
saw
the
queer
flame
in
the
coombe
himself
was
fantastically
struck
by
the
sudden
thought
that
its
expression
might
have
been
that
of
an
obstinate
young
martyr
staring
at
the
stake
robin
shrilled
out
her
words
andrews
will
pinch
me
andrews
will
pinch
me
but
no
no
and
she
kept
her
hand
behind
her
back
oh
miss
robin
you
naughty
child
cried
andrews
with
pathos
your
poor
andrews
that
takes
such
care
of
you
horrid
little
thing
feather
pettishly
exclaimed
take
her
upstairs
andrews
she
shall
not
come
down
again
harrowby
settling
his
pince
nez
a
little
excitedly
in
the
spurred
novelty
of
his
interest
murmured
if
she
does
want
to
go
she
will
begin
to
shriek
this
looks
as
if
she
were
a
little
termagant
but
she
did
not
shriek
when
andrews
led
her
towards
the
door
the
ugly
one
with
the
wicked
face
was
the
one
who
had
done
it
he
filled
her
with
horror
to
have
touched
him
would
have
been
like
touching
some
wild
beast
of
prey
that
was
all
she
went
with
andrews
quite
quietly
will
you
shake
hands
with
me
said
the
starling
goodnaturedly
as
she
passed
i
hope
she
wo
snub
me
she
dropped
aside
to
harrowby
robin
put
out
her
hand
prettily
shake
mine
suggested
harrowby
and
she
obeyed
him
and
mine
smiled
vesey
with
his
best
allure
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
as
a
result
of
the
allure
probably
a
tiny
smile
flickered
about
the
corners
of
her
mouth
he
did
not
look
wicked
i
remain
an
outcast
remarked
coombe
as
the
door
closed
behind
the
little
figure
i
detest
an
child
said
feather
she
ought
to
be
slapped
we
used
to
be
slapped
if
we
were
rude
she
said
andrews
would
pinch
her
is
pinching
the
customary
discipline
it
ought
to
be
she
deserves
it
feather
was
quite
out
of
temper
but
andrews
is
too
good
to
her
she
is
a
perfect
creature
and
conducts
herself
like
a
clock
there
has
never
been
the
slightest
trouble
in
the
nursery
you
see
how
the
child
looks
though
her
face
is
quite
as
round
as
it
was
she
laughed
disagreeably
and
shrugged
her
white
undressed
shoulders
i
think
it
a
little
horrid
myself
a
child
of
that
age
fretting
herself
thin
about
a
boy
chapter
xii
but
though
she
had
made
no
protest
on
being
taken
out
of
the
robin
had
known
that
what
andrews
whisper
had
promised
would
take
place
when
she
reached
the
nursery
she
was
too
young
to
feel
more
than
terror
which
had
no
defense
whatever
she
had
no
more
defense
against
andrews
than
she
had
had
against
the
man
who
had
robbed
her
of
donal
they
were
both
big
and
powerful
and
she
was
nothing
but
out
of
the
wonders
she
had
begun
to
know
there
had
risen
in
her
before
almost
inert
little
being
a
certain
stirring
for
a
brief
period
she
had
learned
happiness
and
love
and
woe
and
this
evening
inchoate
rebellion
against
an
enemy
andrews
led
by
the
hand
up
the
narrow
staircase
something
she
had
never
led
before
she
was
quite
unaware
of
this
and
as
she
mounted
each
step
her
temper
mounted
also
and
it
was
the
temper
of
an
incensed
personal
vanity
abnormally
strong
in
this
particular
woman
when
they
were
inside
the
nursery
and
the
door
was
shut
she
led
robin
to
the
middle
of
the
small
and
gloomy
room
and
released
her
hand
now
my
lady
she
said
i
going
to
pay
you
out
for
disgracing
me
before
everybody
in
the
she
had
taken
the
child
below
stairs
for
a
few
minutes
before
bringing
her
up
for
the
night
she
had
stopped
in
the
kitchen
for
something
she
wanted
for
herself
she
laid
her
belongings
on
a
chest
of
drawers
and
turned
about
i
going
to
teach
you
a
lesson
you
wo
forget
she
said
what
happened
next
turned
the
woman
quite
sick
with
the
shock
of
amazement
the
child
had
in
the
past
been
a
soft
puppet
she
had
been
automatic
obedience
and
gentleness
privately
andrews
had
somewhat
looked
down
on
her
lack
of
spirit
though
it
had
been
her
own
best
asset
the
outbreak
downstairs
had
been
an
abnormality
and
now
she
stood
before
her
with
hands
clenched
her
little
face
wild
with
defiant
rage
i
scream
i
scream
i
scream
she
shrieked
andrews
actually
heard
herself
gulp
but
she
sprang
up
and
forward
you
scream
she
could
scarcely
believe
her
own
feelings
not
to
mention
the
evidence
of
her
ears
you
scream
the
next
instant
was
more
astonishing
still
robin
threw
herself
on
her
knees
and
scrambled
like
a
cat
she
was
under
the
bed
and
in
the
remotest
corner
against
the
wall
she
was
actually
unreachable
and
she
lay
on
her
back
kicking
madly
hammering
her
heels
against
the
floor
and
uttering
piercing
shrieks
as
something
had
seemed
to
let
itself
go
when
she
writhed
under
the
bushes
in
the
gardens
so
did
something
let
go
now
in
her
overstrung
little
mind
there
ruled
for
this
moment
the
feeling
that
if
she
was
to
be
pinched
she
would
be
pinched
for
a
reason
andrews
knelt
by
the
side
of
the
bed
she
had
a
long
strong
thin
arm
and
it
darted
beneath
and
clutched
but
it
was
not
long
enough
to
attain
the
corner
where
the
kicking
and
screaming
was
going
on
her
temper
became
fury
before
her
impotence
and
her
hideous
realization
of
being
made
ridiculous
by
this
baby
of
six
two
floors
below
the
afterglow
of
the
little
dinner
was
going
on
suppose
even
far
echoes
of
the
screams
should
be
heard
and
make
her
more
ridiculous
still
she
knew
how
they
would
laugh
and
her
mistress
would
make
some
silly
joke
about
robin
being
too
much
for
her
her
fury
rose
so
high
that
she
had
barely
sense
to
realize
that
she
must
not
let
herself
go
too
far
when
she
got
hold
of
the
child
get
hold
of
her
she
would
and
pay
her
out
my
word
she
would
pay
her
out
you
little
devil
she
said
between
her
teeth
wait
till
i
get
hold
of
you
and
robin
shrieked
and
hammered
more
insanely
still
the
bed
was
rather
a
low
one
and
it
was
difficult
for
any
one
larger
than
a
child
to
find
room
beneath
it
the
correct
and
naturally
rigid
andrews
lay
flat
upon
her
stomach
and
wriggled
herself
partly
under
the
edge
just
far
enough
for
her
long
and
strong
arm
and
equally
long
and
strong
clutching
fingers
to
do
their
work
in
her
present
state
of
mind
andrews
would
have
broken
her
back
rather
than
not
have
reached
the
creature
who
so
defied
her
the
strong
fingers
clenched
a
flying
petticoat
and
dragged
at
it
fiercely
the
next
moment
they
clutched
a
frantic
foot
with
a
power
which
could
not
be
broken
away
from
a
jerk
and
a
remorseless
dragging
over
the
carpet
and
robin
was
out
of
the
protecting
darkness
and
in
the
gas
light
again
lying
tumbled
and
in
an
untidy
torn
little
heap
on
the
nursery
floor
andrews
was
panting
but
she
did
not
loose
her
hold
as
she
scrambled
without
a
rag
of
professional
dignity
to
her
feet
my
word
she
breathlessly
gave
forth
i
got
you
now
got
you
now
she
so
looked
that
to
robin
she
seemed
like
the
ugly
man
downstairs
a
sort
of
wicked
wild
beast
whose
mere
touch
would
have
been
horror
even
if
it
did
not
hurt
and
the
child
knew
what
was
coming
she
felt
herself
dragged
up
from
the
floor
and
also
dragged
between
andrew
knees
which
felt
bony
and
hard
as
iron
there
was
no
getting
away
from
them
andrews
had
seated
herself
firmly
on
a
chair
holding
her
between
the
iron
knees
she
put
her
large
hand
over
her
mouth
it
was
a
hand
large
enough
to
cover
more
than
her
mouth
only
the
eyes
seemed
to
flare
wide
and
lustrous
above
it
you
scream
she
said
you
hammer
on
the
floor
with
your
heels
you
behave
like
a
wildcat
you
that
been
like
a
kitten
you
never
done
it
before
and
you
never
do
it
again
if
it
takes
me
three
days
i
make
you
remember
and
then
her
hand
dropped
and
her
jaw
dropped
and
she
sat
staring
with
a
furious
sick
white
face
at
the
open
door
which
she
had
shut
as
she
came
in
the
top
floor
had
always
been
so
safe
the
nursery
had
been
her
own
autocratic
domain
there
had
been
no
human
creature
to
whom
it
would
have
occurred
to
interfere
that
was
it
she
had
been
actually
safe
unheard
in
the
midst
of
the
struggle
the
door
had
been
opened
without
a
knock
there
on
the
threshold
as
stiff
as
a
ramrod
and
with
his
hateful
eyes
uncovering
their
gleam
lord
coombe
was
standing
no
other
than
lord
coombe
having
a
sharp
working
knowledge
of
her
world
andrews
knew
that
it
was
all
up
he
had
come
upstairs
deliberately
she
knew
what
he
had
come
for
he
was
as
clever
as
he
was
bad
and
he
had
seen
something
when
he
glanced
at
her
in
the
now
he
had
heard
and
seen
her
as
she
dragged
robin
from
under
the
bed
come
up
for
that
for
some
queer
evil
reason
of
his
own
the
promptings
of
a
remote
gutter
training
made
her
feel
a
desire
to
use
language
such
as
she
still
had
wisdom
enough
to
restrain
you
are
a
very
great
fool
young
woman
he
said
you
have
nothing
but
your
character
as
a
nurse
to
live
on
a
scene
in
a
police
court
would
ruin
you
there
is
a
society
which
interferes
with
nursery
torture
robin
freed
from
the
iron
grasp
had
slunk
behind
a
chair
he
was
there
again
andrews
body
automatically
responsive
to
rule
and
habit
rose
from
its
seat
and
stood
before
this
member
of
a
class
which
required
an
upright
position
she
knew
better
than
to
attempt
to
excuse
or
explain
she
had
heard
about
the
society
and
she
knew
publicity
would
spell
ruin
and
starvation
she
had
got
herself
into
an
appalling
mess
being
caught
there
you
were
but
that
this
swell
should
actually
have
been
awakened
by
some
whim
to
notice
and
follow
her
up
was
past
her
as
she
would
have
put
it
you
were
going
to
pinch
her
by
instalments
i
suppose
he
said
you
inferred
that
it
might
last
three
days
when
she
said
you
would
in
the
it
occurred
to
me
to
look
into
it
what
are
your
wages
thirty
pounds
a
year
my
lord
go
tomorrow
morning
to
benby
who
engaged
you
for
he
will
be
at
his
office
by
nine
and
will
pay
you
what
is
owed
to
you
and
a
month
wages
in
lieu
of
notice
the
mistress
began
andrews
i
have
spoken
to
mrs
it
was
a
lie
serenely
told
feather
was
doing
a
new
skirt
dance
in
the
she
is
engaged
pack
your
box
jennings
will
call
a
cab
it
was
the
utter
idiotic
hopelessness
of
saying
anything
to
him
which
finished
her
you
might
as
well
talk
to
a
front
door
or
a
street
lamp
any
silly
thing
you
might
try
would
even
reach
his
ears
he
had
no
ears
for
you
you
did
matter
enough
shall
i
leave
her
here
as
she
is
she
said
denoting
robin
undress
her
and
put
her
to
bed
before
you
pack
your
box
absolutely
certain
fine
cold
modulations
in
the
voice
which
stood
for
his
special
plane
of
breeding
had
their
effect
on
her
grovelling
though
raging
soul
he
was
so
exactly
what
he
was
and
what
she
was
not
and
could
never
attain
i
will
stay
here
while
you
do
it
then
go
no
vocabulary
of
the
servants
hall
could
have
encompassed
the
fine
phrase
grand
seigneur
but
when
blayne
and
the
rest
talked
of
him
in
their
least
resentful
and
more
amiable
moods
they
unconsciously
made
efforts
to
express
the
quality
in
him
which
these
two
words
convey
he
had
ways
of
his
own
men
that
paid
a
pretty
woman
bills
and
kept
her
going
in
luxury
jennings
and
blayne
and
the
others
knew
something
about
they
sometimes
began
well
enough
but
as
time
went
on
they
forgot
themselves
and
got
into
the
way
of
being
familiar
and
showing
they
realized
that
they
paid
for
things
and
had
their
rights
most
of
them
began
to
be
almost
like
husbands
speak
slighting
and
sharp
and
be
a
bit
stiff
about
accounts
even
before
servants
they
ran
in
and
out
or
after
a
while
began
to
stay
away
and
not
show
up
for
weeks
he
was
different
so
different
that
it
was
queer
queer
it
certainly
was
that
he
really
came
to
the
place
very
seldom
wherever
they
met
it
did
noticeably
often
happen
in
the
slice
of
a
house
he
came
as
if
he
were
a
visitor
he
took
no
liberties
everything
was
punctiliously
referred
to
benby
who
did
everything
conducted
himself
outwardly
as
if
he
were
a
sort
of
man
of
business
in
employ
it
was
open
to
the
lenient
to
believe
that
she
depended
on
some
mysterious
private
income
there
were
people
who
preferred
to
try
to
believe
this
but
there
were
those
who
in
some
occult
way
knew
exactly
where
her
income
came
from
there
were
in
fact
hypercritical
persons
who
did
not
know
or
notice
her
but
she
had
quite
an
entertaining
smart
circle
which
neither
suspicions
nor
beliefs
prevented
from
placing
her
in
their
visiting
lists
coombe
did
keep
it
up
in
the
most
perfect
manner
some
of
them
said
admiringly
among
themselves
he
showed
extraordinarily
perfect
taste
many
fashionable
open
secrets
accepted
by
a
brilliant
world
were
not
half
so
fastidiously
managed
andrews
knew
he
had
unswervingly
lied
when
he
said
he
had
spoken
to
mrs
but
he
never
failed
to
place
her
in
the
position
of
authority
that
he
should
have
presented
himself
on
the
nursery
floor
was
amazingly
abnormal
enough
to
mean
some
state
of
mind
unregulated
by
all
natural
rules
him
andrews
thought
that
never
steps
out
of
a
visitor
place
in
the
turning
up
on
the
third
floor
without
a
word
one
thing
she
knew
and
that
came
first
behind
all
the
polite
show
he
was
the
head
of
everything
and
he
was
one
that
you
better
not
give
back
a
sound
to
if
you
knew
what
was
good
for
yourself
whatever
people
said
against
his
character
he
was
one
of
the
grand
and
high
ones
a
word
from
him
ever
so
quiet
and
you
be
done
for
she
was
shaking
with
fear
inwardly
but
she
undressed
robin
and
put
her
in
bed
laying
everything
away
and
making
things
tidy
for
the
night
this
is
the
night
nursery
i
suppose
coombe
had
said
when
she
began
he
put
up
his
glasses
and
looked
the
uninviting
little
room
over
he
scrutinized
it
and
she
wondered
what
his
opinion
of
it
might
be
yes
my
lord
the
day
nursery
is
through
that
door
he
walked
through
the
door
in
question
and
she
could
see
that
he
moved
slowly
about
it
examining
the
few
pieces
of
furniture
curiously
still
with
his
glass
in
his
eye
she
had
finished
undressing
robin
and
had
put
her
in
her
bed
before
he
came
back
into
the
sleeping
apartment
by
that
time
exhausted
by
the
unknown
tempest
she
had
passed
through
the
child
had
dropped
asleep
in
spite
of
herself
she
was
too
tired
to
remember
that
her
enemy
was
in
the
next
room
i
have
seen
the
child
with
you
several
times
when
you
have
not
been
aware
of
it
coombe
said
to
her
before
he
went
downstairs
she
has
evidently
been
well
taken
care
of
as
far
as
her
body
is
concerned
if
you
were
not
venomous
if
you
had
merely
struck
her
when
you
lost
your
temper
you
might
have
had
another
trial
i
know
nothing
about
children
but
i
know
something
about
the
devil
and
if
ever
the
devil
was
in
a
woman
face
and
voice
the
devil
was
in
yours
when
you
dragged
the
little
creature
from
under
the
bed
if
you
had
dared
you
would
have
killed
her
look
after
that
temper
young
woman
benby
shall
keep
an
eye
on
you
if
you
take
another
place
as
nurse
and
i
shall
know
where
you
are
my
lord
andrews
gasped
you
would
overlook
a
woman
and
take
her
living
from
her
and
send
her
to
starvation
i
would
take
her
living
from
her
and
send
her
to
starvation
without
a
shadow
of
compunction
was
the
reply
made
in
the
fine
gentleman
cultivated
voice
if
she
were
capable
of
what
you
were
capable
of
tonight
you
are
i
judge
about
forty
and
though
you
are
lean
you
are
a
powerful
woman
the
child
is
i
believe
barely
six
and
then
looking
down
at
her
through
his
glass
he
added
to
her
quite
shuddering
astonishment
in
a
tone
whose
very
softness
made
it
really
awful
to
her
damn
you
damn
you
i
i
swear
i
never
let
myself
go
again
my
lord
the
woman
broke
out
devoutly
i
do
think
you
will
it
would
cost
you
too
much
he
said
then
he
went
down
the
steep
crooked
little
staircase
quite
soundlessly
and
andrews
rather
white
and
breathless
went
and
packed
her
trunk
robin
tired
baby
as
she
was
slept
warm
and
deeply
chapter
xiii
it
was
no
custom
of
his
to
outstay
other
people
in
fact
he
usually
went
away
comparatively
early
feather
could
not
imagine
what
his
reason
could
be
but
she
was
sure
there
was
a
reason
she
was
often
disturbed
by
his
reasons
and
found
it
difficult
to
adjust
herself
to
them
how
even
if
one
had
a
logically
brilliant
mind
could
one
calculate
on
a
male
being
who
seemed
not
exactly
to
belong
to
the
race
of
men
as
a
result
of
the
skirt
dancing
the
furniture
of
the
empty
was
a
little
scattered
and
untidy
but
feather
had
found
a
suitable
corner
among
cushions
on
a
sofa
after
everyone
had
gone
leaving
coombe
alone
with
her
she
wished
he
would
sit
down
but
he
preferred
to
stand
in
his
still
uncomfortable
way
i
know
you
are
going
to
tell
me
something
she
broke
the
silence
i
am
when
i
went
out
of
the
room
i
did
not
drive
round
to
my
club
as
i
said
i
found
myself
obliged
to
i
went
upstairs
to
the
third
floor
to
the
nursery
feather
sat
quite
upright
you
went
up
to
the
nursery
if
this
was
the
reason
for
his
staying
what
on
earth
had
he
come
upon
in
the
region
of
the
third
floor
and
how
ridiculously
unlike
him
to
allow
himself
to
interfere
could
it
be
andrews
and
jennings
surely
andrews
was
too
this
passed
across
her
mind
in
a
flash
you
called
andrews
to
use
her
authority
with
the
child
when
she
would
not
shake
hands
with
me
the
little
creature
for
some
reason
of
her
own
evidently
feels
an
antipathy
to
me
that
interested
me
and
i
watched
her
as
andrews
whispered
in
her
ear
the
vanity
was
stung
i
realized
that
she
whispered
a
threat
a
hint
of
actual
ferocity
showed
in
her
eyes
in
spite
of
herself
robin
turned
pale
andrews
was
quite
right
children
must
be
punished
when
they
are
rude
feather
felt
this
at
once
silly
and
boring
what
did
he
know
about
such
matters
the
child
said
will
pinch
me
and
i
caught
andrews
eye
and
knew
it
was
true
also
that
she
had
done
it
before
i
looked
at
the
woman
long
thin
strong
fingers
they
were
cruel
fingers
i
do
not
take
liberties
as
a
rule
but
i
took
a
liberty
i
excused
myself
and
climbed
three
flights
of
stairs
never
had
feather
been
so
surprised
in
her
life
she
looked
like
a
bewildered
child
but
what
could
it
matter
to
you
she
said
in
soft
amaze
i
do
know
his
answer
came
after
a
moment
pause
i
have
caprices
of
mood
certain
mental
images
made
my
temperature
rise
momentarily
it
did
matter
one
is
like
that
at
times
feline
face
and
her
muscular
fingers
and
the
child
extraordinarily
exquisite
flesh
gave
me
a
second
furious
shudder
feather
quite
broke
in
upon
him
are
you
are
you
fond
of
children
no
he
was
really
abrupt
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
in
my
life
as
being
fond
of
things
that
was
what
i
mean
i
thought
so
feather
faltered
as
if
in
polite
acquiescence
with
a
quite
natural
fact
coombe
proceeded
as
i
went
up
the
stairs
i
heard
screams
and
i
thought
that
the
pinching
had
begun
i
got
up
quickly
and
opened
the
door
and
found
the
woman
lying
flat
on
the
floor
by
the
bed
dragging
out
the
child
who
had
hidden
under
it
the
woman
face
was
devilish
and
so
was
her
voice
i
heard
her
threats
she
got
on
her
feet
and
dragged
the
child
up
and
held
her
between
her
knees
she
clapped
her
hand
over
mouth
to
stifle
her
shrieks
there
i
stopped
her
she
had
a
fright
at
sight
of
me
which
taught
her
something
he
ended
rather
slowly
i
took
the
great
liberty
of
ordering
her
to
pack
her
box
and
leave
the
house
course
with
a
slight
bow
using
you
as
my
authority
andrews
cried
feather
aghast
has
she
gone
would
you
have
kept
her
he
inquired
it
true
that
that
pinching
feather
voice
almost
held
tears
really
hard
pinching
is
is
not
proper
but
andrews
has
been
invaluable
everyone
says
robin
is
better
dressed
and
better
kept
than
other
children
and
she
is
never
allowed
to
make
the
least
noise
one
would
if
one
were
pinched
by
those
devilish
sinewy
fingers
every
time
one
raised
one
voice
yes
she
has
gone
i
ordered
her
to
put
her
charge
to
bed
before
she
packed
i
did
not
leave
her
alone
with
robin
in
fact
i
walked
about
the
two
nurseries
and
looked
them
over
he
had
walked
about
the
night
nursery
and
the
day
nursery
he
the
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
whose
finely
acrid
summing
up
of
things
they
were
all
secretly
afraid
of
if
the
truth
were
known
they
stood
for
her
smart
feverishly
set
in
their
way
they
half
unconsciously
tried
to
propitiate
something
in
him
always
without
producing
the
least
effect
her
mental
vision
presented
to
her
his
image
as
he
had
walked
about
the
horrid
little
rooms
his
somewhat
stiffly
held
head
not
much
below
the
low
ceilings
he
had
taken
in
shabby
carpets
furniture
faded
walls
general
dim
dinginess
it
an
unholy
den
for
anything
to
spend
its
days
in
that
third
floor
he
made
the
statement
detachedly
in
a
way
if
she
six
she
has
lived
six
years
there
and
known
nothing
else
all
london
top
floors
are
like
it
said
feather
and
they
are
all
nurseries
and
school
rooms
where
there
are
children
his
faintly
smiling
glance
took
in
her
slimness
in
its
glittering
sheath
the
zephyr
scarf
floating
from
the
snow
of
her
bared
loveliness
her
delicate
soft
chin
deliciously
lifted
as
she
looked
up
at
him
how
would
you
like
it
he
asked
but
i
am
not
a
child
in
pretty
protest
children
are
are
different
you
look
like
a
child
he
suddenly
said
queerly
as
if
the
aspect
of
her
caught
him
for
an
instant
and
made
him
sometimes
a
woman
does
not
often
she
bloomed
into
a
kind
of
delighted
radiance
you
do
often
pay
me
compliments
she
said
that
is
a
beautiful
one
robin
makes
it
more
beautiful
it
is
a
compliment
he
answered
still
watching
her
in
the
slightly
absent
manner
it
is
a
tragic
truth
he
passed
his
hand
lightly
across
his
eyes
as
if
he
swept
something
away
and
then
both
looked
and
spoke
exactly
as
before
i
have
decided
to
buy
the
long
lease
of
this
house
it
is
for
sale
he
said
casually
i
shall
buy
it
for
the
child
for
robin
said
feather
helplessly
yes
for
robin
it
it
would
be
an
income
whatever
happened
it
is
in
the
very
heart
of
mayfair
she
said
because
in
her
astonishment
almost
consternation
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
he
would
not
buy
it
for
her
he
thought
her
too
silly
to
trust
but
if
it
were
robin
it
would
be
hers
also
a
girl
could
turn
her
own
mother
into
the
street
amid
the
folds
of
her
narrow
being
hid
just
one
spark
of
shrewdness
which
came
to
life
where
she
herself
was
concerned
two
or
three
rooms
not
large
ones
can
be
added
at
the
back
he
went
on
i
glanced
out
of
a
window
to
see
if
it
could
be
done
incomprehensible
as
he
was
one
might
always
be
sure
of
a
certain
princeliness
in
his
inexplicable
methods
he
never
was
personal
or
mean
an
addition
to
the
slice
of
a
house
that
really
was
generous
entrancement
filled
her
that
really
is
kind
of
you
she
murmured
gratefully
it
seems
too
much
to
ask
you
did
not
ask
it
was
his
answer
but
i
shall
benefit
by
it
nothing
could
be
nicer
these
rooms
are
so
much
too
small
glancing
about
her
in
flushed
rapture
and
my
bedroom
is
dreadful
i
obliged
to
use
rob
for
a
the
new
rooms
will
be
for
robin
he
said
an
excellent
method
he
had
discovered
of
entirely
detaching
himself
from
the
excitements
and
emotions
of
other
persons
removed
the
usual
difficulties
in
the
way
of
disappointing
speaking
truths
to
or
embarrassing
people
who
deserved
it
it
was
this
method
which
had
utterly
cast
down
the
defences
of
andrews
feather
was
so
wholly
left
out
of
the
situation
that
she
was
actually
almost
saved
from
its
awkwardness
when
one
is
six
he
explained
one
will
soon
be
seven
nine
twelve
then
the
teens
begin
to
loom
up
and
one
can
not
be
concealed
in
cupboards
on
a
top
floor
even
before
that
time
a
governess
is
necessary
and
even
from
the
abyss
of
my
ignorance
i
see
that
no
respectable
woman
would
stand
either
the
night
or
the
day
nursery
your
daughter
oh
do
call
her
that
cried
feather
my
daughter
it
sounds
as
if
she
were
eighteen
she
felt
as
if
she
had
a
sudden
hideous
little
shock
six
years
had
passed
since
bob
died
a
daughter
a
school
girl
with
long
hair
and
long
legs
to
keep
out
of
the
way
a
girl
to
drag
about
with
one
never
would
she
do
it
three
sixes
are
eighteen
coombe
continued
as
was
impressed
upon
one
in
early
years
by
the
multiplication
table
i
never
saw
you
so
interested
in
anything
before
feather
faltered
climbing
steep
narrow
horrid
stairs
to
her
nursery
dismissing
her
nurse
she
paused
a
second
because
a
very
ugly
little
idea
had
clutched
at
her
it
arose
from
and
was
complicated
with
many
fantastic
half
formed
secret
resentments
of
the
past
it
made
her
laugh
a
shade
hysterical
are
you
going
to
see
that
she
is
properly
brought
up
and
educated
so
that
if
anyone
important
falls
in
love
with
her
she
can
make
a
good
match
hers
was
quite
a
hideous
little
mind
he
was
telling
himself
fearful
in
its
latter
day
casting
aside
of
all
such
small
matters
as
taste
and
feeling
people
stripped
the
garments
from
things
in
these
days
he
laughed
inwardly
at
himself
and
his
unwitting
these
days
senile
severity
mouthed
just
such
phrases
were
they
not
his
own
days
and
the
outcome
of
a
past
which
had
considered
itself
so
much
more
decorous
had
not
boldly
questionable
attitudes
been
held
in
those
other
days
how
long
was
it
since
the
prince
regent
himself
had
flourished
it
was
only
that
these
days
brought
it
all
close
against
one
eyes
but
this
exquisite
creature
had
a
hideous
little
mind
of
her
own
whatsoever
her
day
later
he
confessed
to
himself
that
he
was
unprepared
to
see
her
spring
to
her
feet
and
stand
before
him
absurdly
fantastically
near
being
impassioned
you
think
i
as
too
silly
to
see
anything
she
broke
forth
but
i
do
see
a
long
way
sometimes
i
ca
bear
it
but
i
do
i
do
i
shall
have
a
daughter
she
will
be
the
kind
of
girl
everyone
will
look
at
and
someone
important
may
want
to
marry
her
but
oh
he
was
reminded
of
the
day
when
she
had
fallen
at
his
feet
and
clasped
his
rigid
and
reluctant
knees
this
was
something
of
the
same
feeble
desperation
of
mood
oh
why
someone
like
that
have
wanted
to
marry
me
see
she
was
like
a
pathetic
fairy
as
she
spread
her
nymphlike
arms
how
pretty
i
am
his
gaze
held
her
a
moment
in
the
singular
fashion
with
which
she
had
become
actually
familiar
because
at
long
intervals
she
kept
seeing
it
again
he
quite
gently
took
her
fingers
and
returned
her
to
her
sofa
please
sit
down
again
he
requested
it
will
be
better
she
sat
down
without
another
imbecile
word
to
say
as
for
him
he
changed
the
subject
with
your
permission
benby
will
undertake
the
business
of
the
lease
and
the
building
he
explained
the
plans
will
be
brought
to
you
we
will
go
over
them
together
if
you
wish
there
will
be
decent
rooms
for
robin
and
her
governess
the
two
nurseries
can
be
made
fit
for
human
beings
to
live
in
and
used
for
other
purposes
the
house
will
be
greatly
improved
it
was
nearly
three
when
feather
went
upstairs
to
her
dozing
maid
because
after
he
had
left
her
she
sat
some
time
in
the
empty
untidy
little
and
gazed
straight
before
her
at
a
painted
screen
on
which
shepherdesses
and
swains
were
dancing
in
a
watteau
glade
infested
by
flocks
of
little
loves
chapter
xiv
when
from
robin
embarrassed
young
consciousness
there
had
welled
up
the
hesitating
confession
she
does
like
me
she
could
not
of
course
have
found
words
in
which
to
make
the
reasons
for
her
knowledge
clear
but
they
had
for
herself
no
obscurity
the
fair
being
who
at
rare
intervals
fluttered
on
the
threshold
of
her
world
had
a
way
of
looking
at
her
with
a
shade
of
aloof
distaste
in
her
always
transient
gaze
the
unadorned
fact
was
that
feather
did
not
like
her
she
had
been
outraged
by
her
advent
a
baby
was
absurdly
out
of
the
picture
so
far
as
her
mind
encompassed
a
future
she
saw
herself
flitting
from
flower
to
flower
of
smart
pleasures
and
successes
somehow
with
more
money
and
more
exalted
invitations
something
vaguely
having
happened
to
the
entire
lawdor
progeny
and
she
therefore
occupying
a
position
in
which
it
was
herself
who
could
gracefully
condescend
to
others
there
was
nothing
so
stodgy
as
children
in
the
vision
when
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
she
had
been
consoled
by
the
thought
that
she
had
really
managed
the
whole
thing
very
cleverly
it
was
easier
of
course
to
so
arrange
such
things
in
modern
days
and
in
town
the
day
nursery
and
the
night
nursery
on
the
third
floor
a
young
woman
who
knew
her
business
who
even
knew
what
to
buy
for
a
child
and
where
to
buy
it
without
troubling
any
one
simplified
the
situation
andrews
had
been
quite
wonderful
nobody
can
bother
one
about
a
healthy
handsome
child
who
is
seen
meticulously
cared
for
and
beautifully
dressed
being
pushed
or
led
or
carried
out
in
the
open
air
every
day
but
there
had
arrived
the
special
morning
when
she
had
seen
a
child
who
so
stood
out
among
a
dozen
children
that
she
had
been
startled
when
she
recognized
that
it
was
robin
andrews
had
taken
her
charge
to
hyde
park
that
day
and
feather
was
driving
through
the
row
on
her
way
to
a
knightsbridge
shop
first
her
glance
had
been
caught
by
the
hair
hanging
to
the
little
hips
extraordinary
hair
in
which
andrews
herself
had
a
pride
then
she
had
seen
the
slender
exquisitely
modeled
legs
and
the
dancing
sway
of
the
small
body
a
wonderfully
cut
stitched
and
fagotted
smock
and
hat
she
had
of
course
taken
in
at
a
flash
when
the
child
suddenly
turned
to
look
at
some
little
girls
in
a
pony
cart
the
amazing
damask
of
her
colour
and
form
and
depth
of
eye
had
given
her
another
slight
shock
she
realized
that
what
she
had
thrust
lightly
away
in
a
corner
of
her
third
floor
produced
an
unmistakable
effect
when
turned
out
into
the
light
of
a
gay
world
the
creature
was
tall
too
for
six
years
old
was
she
really
six
it
seemed
incredible
ten
more
years
and
she
would
be
sixteen
had
a
girl
of
fifteen
who
was
a
perfect
catastrophe
she
read
things
and
had
begun
to
talk
about
her
right
to
be
a
woman
emily
was
only
three
years
from
forty
feather
had
reached
the
stage
of
softening
in
her
disdain
of
the
women
in
their
thirties
she
had
found
herself
admitting
that
in
these
days
there
were
women
of
forty
who
had
not
wholly
passed
beyond
the
pale
into
that
outer
darkness
where
there
was
weeping
and
wailing
and
gnashing
of
teeth
but
there
was
no
denying
that
this
six
year
old
baby
with
the
dancing
step
gave
one
almost
hysterically
to
think
her
imagination
could
not
never
had
and
never
would
she
have
allowed
it
to
grasp
any
belief
that
she
herself
could
change
a
feather
no
but
a
creature
of
sixteen
eighteen
with
eyes
that
shape
with
lashes
an
inch
long
with
yards
of
hair
standing
by
one
side
in
ten
years
it
was
ghastly
coombe
in
his
cold
perfunctory
way
climbing
the
crooked
narrow
stairs
dismissing
andrews
looking
over
the
rooms
dismissing
them
so
to
speak
and
then
remaining
after
the
rest
had
gone
to
reveal
to
her
a
new
abnormal
mood
that
in
itself
alone
was
actually
horrible
it
was
abnormal
and
yet
he
had
always
been
more
or
less
like
that
in
all
things
despite
everything
everything
he
had
never
been
in
love
with
her
at
all
at
first
she
had
believed
he
was
then
she
had
tried
to
make
him
care
for
her
he
had
never
failed
her
he
had
done
everything
in
his
grand
seigneur
fashion
nobody
dare
make
gross
comment
upon
her
but
while
he
saw
her
loveliness
as
only
such
a
man
could
she
had
gradually
realized
that
she
had
never
had
even
a
chance
with
him
she
could
not
even
think
that
if
she
had
not
been
so
silly
and
frightened
that
awful
day
six
years
ago
and
had
not
lost
her
head
he
might
have
admired
her
more
and
more
and
in
the
end
asked
her
to
marry
him
he
had
said
there
must
be
no
mistakes
and
she
had
not
been
allowed
to
fall
into
making
one
the
fact
that
she
had
not
had
finally
made
her
feel
the
power
of
a
certain
fascination
in
him
she
thought
it
was
a
result
of
his
special
type
of
looks
his
breeding
the
wonderful
clothes
he
wore
but
it
was
in
truth
his
varieties
of
inaccessibility
a
girl
might
like
him
she
had
said
to
herself
that
night
she
sat
up
late
after
he
left
her
a
girl
who
who
had
sense
might
modern
people
do
grow
old
as
they
used
to
at
he
wo
be
fat
or
bald
and
he
wo
have
lost
his
teeth
people
have
found
out
they
need
he
will
be
as
thin
and
straight
as
he
is
today
and
nothing
can
alter
his
nose
he
will
be
ten
years
cleverer
than
he
is
now
buying
the
house
for
a
child
of
that
age
building
additional
rooms
for
her
in
the
fevered
rapid
whirl
of
the
life
which
was
the
only
one
she
knew
she
had
often
seen
rather
trying

the
folly

being

alter
their

their
views
about
what
they
had
temporarily
believed

permanent

made
for

been
known
to
renew
their
youth
at
the
balls
of
lovely
daughters
in
their
early
teens
and
to
end
by
assuming
the
flowery
chains
of
a
new
allegiance
time
had
of
course
been
when
such
a
volte
face
would
have
aroused
condemnation
and
indignant
discussion
but
a
humorous
leniency
spent
but
little
time
in
selecting
terms
of
severity

had
known
of
several
such
contretemps
ending
in
quite
brilliant
matches
the
enchanting
mothers
usually
consoled
themselves
with
great
ease
and
if
the
party
of
each
part
was
occasionally
wittily
pungent
in
her
comments
on
the
other
everybody
laughed
and
nobody
had
time
to
criticize
a
man
who
had
had
much
to
bestow
and
who
preferred
in
youth
to
bestow
it
upon
himself
was
not
infrequently
more
in
the
mood
for
the
sharing
of
marriage
when
years
had
revealed
to
him
the
distressing
fact
that
he
was
not
and
had
never
been
the
centre
of
the
universe
which
distressing
fact
is
one
so
unfairly
concealed
from
youth
in
bloom
it
was
of
course
but
as
a
vaguely
outlined
vision
that
these
recognitions
floated
through
what
could
only
be
alleged
to
be
feather
mind
because
there
was
no
other
name
for
it
the
dark
little
staircase
the
rejected
and
despised
third
floor
and
coombe
detachedly
announcing
his
plans
for
the
house
had
set
the
so
to
speak
rather
malarious
mist
flowing
around
her
a
trying
thing
was
that
it
did
not
really
dispel
itself
altogether
but
continued
to
hang
about
the
atmosphere
surrounding
other
and
more
cheerful
things
almost
impalpably
it
added
to
the
familiar
feeling
or
lack
of
feeling
with
regard
to
robin
she
had
not
at
all
hated
the
little
thing
it
had
merely
been
quite
true
that
in
an
inactive
way
she
had
not
liked
her
in
the
folds
of
the
vague
mist
quietly
floated
the
truth
that
she
now
liked
her
less
benby
came
to
see
and
talk
to
her
on
the
business
of
the
structural
changes
to
be
made
he
conducted
himself
precisely
as
though
her
views
on
the
matter
were
of
value
and
could
not
in
fact
be
dispensed
with
he
brought
the
architect
plans
with
him
and
explained
them
with
care
they
were
clever
plans
which
made
the
most
of
a
limited
area
he
did
not
even
faintly
smile
when
it
revealed
itself
to
him
as
it
unconsciously
did
that
regarded
their
adroit
arrangement
as
a
singular
misuse
of
space
which
could
have
been
much
better
employed
for
necessities
of
her
own
she
was
much
depressed
by
the
ground
floor
addition
which
might
have
enlarged
her
but
which
was
made
into
a
for
robin
and
her
future
governess
and
that
is
in
addition
to
her
schoolroom
which
might
have
been
thrown
into
the
besides
the
new
bedrooms
which
i
needed
so
much
she
said
the
new
nurse
who
is
a
highly
respectable
person
explained
benby
could
not
have
been
secured
if
she
had
not
known
that
improvements
were
being
made
the
reconstruction
of
the
third
floor
will
provide
suitable
accommodations
the
special
forte
of
dowson
the
new
nurse
was
a
sublimated
respectability
far
superior
to
smartness
she
had
been
mystically
produced
by
benby
and
her
bonnets
and
jackets
alone
would
have
revealed
her
selection
from
almost
occult
treasures
she
wore
bonnets
and
jackets
not
hats
and
coats
in
the
calm
days
of
her
majesty
nurses
dressed
as
she
does
i
do
not
mean
in
the
riotous
later
years
of
her
reign
but
earlier
when
england
dreamed
in
terms
of
crystal
palaces
and
great
exhibitions
she
can
only
be
the
result
of
excavation
coombe
said
of
her
she
was
as
proud
of
her
respectability
as
andrews
had
been
of
her
smartness
this
had
in
fact
proved
an
almost
insuperable
obstacle
to
her
engagement
the
slice
of
a
house
with
its
flocking
in
and
out
of
chattering
smart
people
in
marvellous
clothes
was
not
the
place
for
her
nor
was
the
mistress
of
her
dreams
but
her
husband
had
met
with
an
accident
and
must
be
kept
in
a
hospital
and
an
invalid
daughter
must
live
by
the
seaside
and
suddenly
when
things
were
at
their
worst
with
her
had
come
benby
with
a
firm
determination
to
secure
her
with
wages
such
as
no
other
place
would
offer
besides
which
she
had
observed
as
she
had
lived
things
have
changed
she
reflected
soberly
you
got
to
resign
yourself
and
not
be
too
particular
she
accepted
the
third
floor
as
benby
had
said
because
it
was
to
be
rearranged
and
the
night
and
day
nurseries
being
thrown
into
one
repainted
and
papered
would
make
a
decent
place
to
live
in
at
the
beautiful
little
girl
given
into
her
charge
she
often
looked
in
a
puzzled
way
because
she
knew
a
good
deal
about
children
and
about
this
one
there
was
something
odd
her
examination
of
opened
drawers
and
closets
revealed
piles
of
exquisite
garments
of
all
varieties
all
perfectly
kept
in
these
dingy
holes
which
called
themselves
nurseries
she
found
evidence
that
money
had
been
spent
like
water
so
that
the
child
when
she
was
seen
might
look
like
a
small
princess
but
she
found
no
plaything
no
dolls
or
toys
and
only
one
picture
book
and
that
had
donal
written
on
the
fly
leaf
and
evidently
belonged
to
someone
else
what
exactly
she
would
have
done
when
she
had
had
time
to
think
the
matter
over
she
never
knew
because
a
few
days
after
her
arrival
a
tall
thin
gentleman
coming
up
the
front
steps
as
she
was
going
out
with
robin
stopped
and
spoke
to
her
as
if
he
knew
who
she
was
you
know
the
kind
of
things
children
like
to
play
with
nurse
he
said
she
respectfully
replied
that
she
had
had
long
experience
with
young
desires
she
did
not
know
as
yet
who
he
was
but
there
was
that
about
him
which
made
her
feel
that
while
there
was
no
knowing
what
height
his
particular
exaltation
in
the
matter
of
rank
might
reach
one
would
be
safe
in
setting
it
high
please
go
to
one
of
the
toy
shops
and
choose
for
the
child
what
she
will
like
best
dolls
games
you
will
know
what
to
select
send
the
bill
to
me
at
coombe
house
i
am
lord
coombe
thank
you
my
lord
dowson
answered
with
a
sketch
of
a
curtsey
miss
robin
you
must
hold
out
your
little
hand
and
say
you
to
his
lordship
for
being
so
kind
he
told
dowson
to
buy
you
some
beautiful
dolls
and
picture
books
as
a
present
robin
eyelashes
curled
against
her
under
brows
in
her
wide
still
glance
upward
at
him
here
was
the
one
again
she
shut
her
hand
tightly
into
a
fist
behind
her
back
lord
coombe
smiled
a
little
not
much
she
does
not
like
me
he
said
it
is
not
necessary
that
she
should
give
me
her
hand
i
prefer
that
she
should
if
she
does
want
to
good
morning
dowson
to
the
mind
of
dowson
this
seemed
treating
too
lightly
a
matter
as
serious
as
juvenile
incivility
she
remonstrated
gravely
and
at
length
with
robin
little
girls
must
behave
prettily
to
kind
gentlemen
who
are
friends
of
their
mammas
it
is
dreadful
to
be
rude
and
not
say
you
she
said
but
as
she
talked
she
was
vaguely
aware
that
her
words
passed
by
the
child
ears
as
the
summer
wind
passed
perhaps
it
was
all
a
bit
of
temper
and
would
disappear
and
leave
no
trace
behind
at
the
same
time
there
was
something
queer
about
the
little
thing
she
had
a
listless
way
of
sitting
staring
out
of
the
window
and
seeming
to
have
no
desire
to
amuse
herself
she
was
too
young
to
be
listless
and
she
did
not
care
for
her
food
dowson
asked
permission
to
send
for
the
doctor
and
when
he
came
he
ordered
sea
air
of
course
you
can
take
her
away
for
a
few
weeks
said
here
she
smiled
satirically
and
added
but
i
can
tell
you
what
it
is
all
about
the
little
minx
actually
fell
in
love
with
a
small
boy
she
met
in
the
square
gardens
and
when
his
mother
took
him
from
london
she
began
to
mope
like
a
tiresome
girl
in
her
teens
it
ridiculous
but
is
the
real
trouble
oh
said
dowson
the
low
and
respectful
interjection
expressing
a
shade
of
disapproval
children
do
have
fancies
get
over
it
if
we
give
her
something
else
to
think
of
the
good
woman
went
to
one
of
the
large
toy
shops
and
bought
a
beautiful
doll
a
doll
house
and
some
picture
books
when
they
were
brought
up
to
the
day
nursery
robin
was
asleep
after
a
rather
long
walk
which
dowson
had
decided
would
be
good
for
her
when
she
came
later
into
the
room
after
the
things
had
been
unpacked
she
regarded
them
with
an
expression
of
actual
dislike
is
that
a
beautiful
doll
said
dowson
and
did
you
ever
see
such
a
lovely
house
it
was
kind
lord
coombe
who
gave
them
to
you
just
you
look
at
the
picture
books
robin
put
her
hands
behind
her
back
and
would
not
touch
them
dowson
who
was
a
motherly
creature
with
a
great
deal
of
commonsense
was
set
thinking
she
began
to
make
guesses
though
she
was
not
yet
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
household
to
guess
from
any
firm
foundation
of
knowledge
of
small
things
come
here
dear
she
said
and
drew
the
small
thing
to
her
knee
is
it
because
you
do
love
lord
coombe
she
asked
yes
she
answered
but
why
said
dowson
when
he
is
such
a
kind
gentleman
but
robin
would
not
tell
her
why
and
never
did
she
never
told
any
one
until
years
had
passed
how
this
had
been
the
beginning
of
a
hatred
the
toys
were
left
behind
when
she
was
taken
to
the
seaside
dowson
tried
to
persuade
her
to
play
with
them
several
times
but
she
would
not
touch
them
so
they
were
put
away
feeling
that
she
was
dealing
with
something
unusual
and
being
a
kindly
person
dowson
bought
her
some
playthings
on
her
own
account
they
were
simple
things
but
robin
was
ready
enough
to
like
them
did
you
give
them
to
me
she
asked
yes
i
did
miss
robin
the
child
drew
near
her
after
a
full
minute
of
hesitation
i
will
kiss
you
she
said
solemnly
and
performed
the
rite
as
as
donal
had
done
dear
little
mite
exclaimed
the
surprised
dowson
dear
me
and
there
was
actual
moisture
in
her
eyes
as
she
squeezed
the
small
body
in
her
arms
she
the
strangest
mite
i
ever
nursed
was
her
comment
to
blayne
below
stairs
it
was
so
sudden
and
she
did
it
as
if
never
done
it
before
i
actually
been
thinking
she
had
any
feeling
at
all
no
reason
why
she
should
have
she
been
taken
care
of
by
the
clock
and
dressed
like
a
puppet
but
she
not
been
treated
human
broke
forth
blayne
then
the
whole
story
was
told
the
upstairs
story
with
much
vivid
description
and
the
mentioning
of
many
names
and
the
dotting
of
many
i
dowson
had
heard
certain
things
only
through
vague
rumour
but
now
she
knew
and
began
to
see
her
way
she
had
not
heard
names
before
and
the
definite
inclusion
of
lord
suggested
something
to
her
do
you
think
the
child
could
be
jealous
of
his
lordship
she
suggested
she
might
if
she
knew
anything
about
him
but
she
never
saw
him
until
the
night
she
was
taken
down
into
the
lived
upstairs
like
a
little
dog
in
its
kennel
well
dowson
reflected
aloud
it
sounds
almost
silly
to
talk
of
a
child
hating
any
one
but
that
bit
of
a
thing
eyes
had
fair
hate
in
them
when
she
looked
up
at
him
where
he
stood
that
was
what
puzzled
me
chapter
xv
before
robin
had
been
taken
to
the
seaside
to
be
helped
by
the
bracing
air
of
the
norfolk
coast
to
recover
her
lost
appetite
and
forget
her
small
tragedy
she
had
observed
that
unaccustomed
things
were
taking
place
in
the
house
workmen
came
in
and
out
through
the
mews
at
the
back
and
brought
ladders
with
them
and
tools
in
queer
bags
she
heard
hammerings
which
began
very
early
in
the
morning
and
went
on
all
day
as
andrews
had
trained
her
not
to
ask
tiresome
questions
she
only
crept
now
and
then
to
a
back
window
and
peeped
out
but
in
a
few
days
dowson
took
her
away
when
she
came
back
to
london
she
was
not
taken
up
the
steep
dark
stairs
to
the
third
floor
dowson
led
her
into
some
rooms
she
had
never
seen
before
they
were
light
and
airy
and
had
pretty
walls
and
furniture
a
on
the
ground
floor
had
even
a
round
window
with
plants
in
it
and
a
canary
bird
singing
in
a
cage
may
we
stay
here
she
asked
dowson
in
a
whisper
we
are
going
to
live
here
was
the
answer
and
so
they
did
at
first
feather
occasionally
took
her
intimates
to
see
the
additional
apartments
in
perfect
splendour
is
the
creature
put
up
and
i
with
a
bedroom
like
a
coalhole
and
such
as
you
see
each
time
you
enter
the
house
she
broke
forth
spitefully
one
day
when
she
forgot
herself
she
said
it
to
the
starling
and
harrowby
who
had
been
simply
gazing
about
them
in
fevered
mystification
because
the
new
development
was
a
thing
which
must
invoke
some
more
or
less
interesting
explanation
at
her
outbreak
all
they
could
do
was
to
gaze
at
her
with
impartial
eyes
which
suggested
question
and
feather
shrugged
pettish
shoulders
you
knew
did
do
it
how
could
i
she
said
it
is
a
queer
whim
of
coombe
of
course
it
is
not
the
least
like
him
i
call
it
morbid
after
which
people
knew
about
the
matter
and
found
it
a
subject
for
edifying
and
quite
stimulating
discussion
there
was
something
fantastic
in
the
situation
coombe
was
the
last
man
on
earth
to
have
taken
the
slightest
notice
of
the
child
existence
it
was
believed
that
he
had
never
seen
her
except
in
long
clothes
until
she
had
glared
at
him
and
put
her
hand
behind
her
back
the
night
she
was
brought
into
the
she
had
been
adroitly
kept
tucked
away
in
an
attic
somewhere
and
now
behold
an
addition
of
several
wonderful
small
rooms
built
furnished
and
decorated
for
her
alone
where
she
was
to
live
as
in
a
miniature
palace
attended
by
servitors
coombe
as
a
purveyor
of
nursery
appurtenances
was
regarded
with
humour
the
general
opinion
being
that
the
eruption
of
a
volcano
beneath
his
feet
alone
could
have
awakened
his
somewhat
chill
to
the
recognition
of
any
child
existence
to
be
exact
we
none
of
us
really
know
anything
in
particular
about
his
mental
processes
harrowby
pondered
aloud
he
capable
of
any
number
of
things
we
might
not
understand
if
he
condescended
to
tell
us
about
them
which
he
would
never
attempt
he
has
a
remote
brilliantly
stored
cynical
mind
he
owns
that
he
is
of
an
inhuman
selfishness
i
have
a
suggestion
to
make
but
it
sets
one
searching
through
the
purlieus
of
one
mind
for
an
approximately
reasonable
explanation
why
was
the
starling
inquiry
harrowby
shrugged
his
shoulders
ever
so
lightly
well
one
is
searching
for
reasons
founded
on
axioms
he
shook
his
head
coombe
no
there
was
a
silence
given
to
occult
thought
feather
is
really
in
a
rage
and
is
too
feathery
to
be
able
to
conceal
it

the
years
which
followed
were
changing
years
growing
years
life
and
entertainment
went
on
fast
and
furiously
in
all
parts
of
london
and
in
no
part
more
rapidly
than
in
the
slice
of
a
house
whose
front
always
presented
an
air
of
having
been
freshly
decorated
in
spite
of
summer
rain
and
winter
soot
and
fog
the
plants
in
the
window
boxes
seemed
always
in
bloom
being
magically
replaced
in
the
early
morning
hours
when
they
dared
to
hint
at
flagging

was
said
must
be
renewed
in
some
such
mysterious
morning
way
as
she
merely
grew
prettier
as
she
neared
thirty
and
passed
it
women
did
in
these
days
which
last
phrase
had
always
been
a
useful
one
probably
from
the
time
of
the
flood
old
fogeys
male
and
female
had
used
it
in
the
past
as
a
means
of
scathingly
unfavourable
comparison
growing
flushed
and
almost
gobbling
like
turkey
cocks
in
their
indignation
now
as
a
phrase
it
was
a
support
and
a
mollifier
in
these
days
one
knew
better
how
to
amuse
oneself
was
more
free
to
snatch
at
agreeable
opportunity
less
in
bondage
to
old
fancies
which
had
called
themselves
beliefs
everything
whirled
faster
and
more
lightly
danced
instead
of
marching
robin
vaguely
connected
certain
changes
in
her
existence
with
the
changes
which
took
place
in
the
fashion
of
sleeves
and
skirts
which
appeared
to
produce
radical
effects
in
the
world
she
caught
glimpses
of
sometimes
sleeves
were
closely
fitted
to
arms
then
puffs
sprang
from
them
and
grew
until
they
were
enormous
and
required
delicate
manipulation
when
coats
were
put
on
then
their
lavishness
of
material
fell
from
the
shoulder
to
the
wrists
and
hung
there
swaying
until
some
sudden
development
of
skirt
seemed
to
distract
their
attention
from
themselves
and
they
shrank
into
unimportance
and
skirts
changed
instead
afterwards
sometimes
figures
were
slim
and
encased
in
sheathlike
draperies
sometimes
folds
rippled
about
feet
fullness
crept
here
or
there
or
disappeared
altogether
trains
grew
longer
or
shorter
or
wider
or
narrower
cashmeres
grosgrain
silks
and
heavy
satins
were
suddenly
gone
and
chiffon
wreathed
itself
about
the
world
and
took
possession
of
it
bonnets
ceased
to
exist
and
hats
were
immense
or
tiny
tall
or
flat
tilted
at
the
back
at
the
side
at
the
front
worn
over
the
face
or
dashingly
rolled
back
from
it
feathers
drooped
or
stood
upright
at
heights
which
rose
and
fell
and
changed
position
with
the
changing
seasons
no
garment
or
individual
wore
the
same
aspect
for
more
than
a
month
time
it
was
necessary
to
change
all
things
with
a
rapidity
matching
the
change
of
moods
and
fancies
which
altered
at
the
rate
of
the
automobiles
which
dashed
here
and
there
and
everywhere
through
country
roads
through
town
through
remote
places
with
an
unsparing
swiftness
which
set
a
new
pace
for
the
world
i
can
not
hark
back
regretfully
to
stage
coaches
said
lord
coombe
even
i
was
not
born
early
enough
for
that
but
in
the
days
of
my
youth
and
innocence
express
trains
seemed
almost
supernatural
one
could
drive
a
pair
of
horses
twenty
miles
to
make
a
country
visit
but
one
could
not
drive
back
the
same
day
one
circle
had
its
limitations
and
degrees
of
intimacy
now
it
is
possible
motor
fifty
miles
to
lunch
and
home
to

in
six
days
and
the
eager
flit
from

engagements
can
be
made
by

the
truly
enterprising
can
accept
an
invitation
to
dine
in

on
a
fortnight
notice
telephones
communicate
in
a
few
seconds
and
no
one
is
secure
from
social
intercourse
for
fifteen

acquaintances
and

have
no
limitations
because
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
globe
can
reach
one
by
motor
or
electricity
in
moments
of
fatigue
i
revert
to
the
days
of
queen
anne
with
pleasure
while
these
changes
went
on
robin
lived
in
her
own
world
in
her
own
quarters
at
the
rear
of
the
slice
of
a
house
during
the
early
years
spent
with
dowson
she
learned
gradually
that
life
was
a
better
thing
than
she
had
known
in
the
dreary
gloom
of
the
third
floor
day
and
night
nurseries
she
was
no
longer
left
to
spend
hours
alone
nor
was
she
taken
below
stairs
to
listen
blankly
to
servants
talking
to
each
other
of
mysterious
things
with
which
she
herself
and
the
lady
downstairs
and
him
were
somehow
connected
her
discovery
of
this
fact
being
based
on
the
dropping
of
voices
and
sidelong
glances
at
her
and
sudden
warning
sounds
from
andrews
she
realized
that
dowson
would
never
pinch
her
and
the
rooms
she
lived
in
were
pretty
and
bright
gradually
playthings
and
picture
books
appeared
in
them
which
she
gathered
dowson
presented
her
with
she
gathered
this
from
dowson
herself
she
had
never
played
with
the
doll
and
by
chance
a
day
arriving
when
lord
coombe
encountered
dowson
in
the
street
without
her
charge
he
stopped
her
again
and
spoke
as
before
is
the
little
girl
well
and
happy
nurse
he
asked
quite
well
my
lord
and
much
happier
than
she
used
to
be
did
she
he
hesitated
slightly
like
the
playthings
you
bought
her
dowson
hesitated
more
than
slightly
but
being
a
sensible
woman
and
at
the
same
time
curious
about
the
matter
she
spoke
the
truth
she
would
play
with
them
at
all
my
lord
i
could
persuade
her
to
what
her
child
fancy
was
i
do
know
neither
do
i
except
that
it
is
founded
on
a
distinct
dislike
said
coombe
there
was
a
brief
pause
are
you
fond
of
toys
yourself
dowson
he
inquired
coldly
i
am
that
and
i
know
how
to
choose
them
your
lordship
replied
dowson
with
a
large
shrewd
intelligence
then
oblige
me
by
throwing
away
the
doll
and
its
accompaniments
and
buying
some
toys
for
yourself
at
my
expense
you
can
present
them
to
miss
robin
as
a
personal
gift
she
will
accept
them
from
you
he
passed
on
his
way
and
dowson
looked
after
him
interestedly
if
she
was
his
she
thought
i
should
be
puzzled
but
not
that
i
ever
heard
of
he
got
some
fancy
of
his
own
the
same
as
robin
has
though
you
would
think
it
to
look
at
him
i
like
to
know
what
it
is
it
was
a
fancy
an
old
old
fancy
it
harked
back
nearly
thirty
years
to
the
dark
days
of
youth
and
passion
and
unending
tragedy
whose
anguish
as
it
then
seemed
could
never
pass
but
which
nevertheless
had
faded
with
the
years
as
they
flowed
by
and
yet
left
him
as
he
was
and
had
been
he
was
not
sentimental
about
it
he
smiled
at
himself
drearily
though
never
at
the
memory
when
it
rose
again
and
through
its
vague
power
led
him
to
do
strange
things
curiously
verging
on
the
emotional
and
eccentric
but
even
the
child
who
quite
loathed
him
for
some
fantastic
infant
reason
of
her
own
even
the
child
had
her
part
in
it
his
soul
oddly
withdrew
itself
into
a
far
remoteness
as
he
walked
away
and
piccadilly
became
a
shadow
and
a
dream
dowson
went
home
and
began
to
pack
neatly
in
a
box
the
neglected
doll
and
the
toys
which
had
accompanied
her
robin
seeing
her
doing
it
asked
a
question
are
they
going
back
to
the
shop
no
lord
coombe
is
letting
me
give
them
to
a
little
girl
who
is
very
poor
and
has
to
lie
in
bed
because
her
back
hurts
her
his
lordship
is
so
kind
he
does
not
want
you
to
be
troubled
with
them
he
is
not
angry
he
is
too
good
to
be
angry
that
was
not
true
thought
robin
he
had
done
that
thing
she
remembered
goodness
could
not
have
done
it
only
badness
when
dowson
brought
in
a
new
doll
and
other
wonderful
things
a
little
hand
enclosed
her
wrist
quite
tightly
as
she
was
unpacking
the
boxes
it
was
robin
and
the
small
creature
looked
at
her
with
a
questioning
half
appealing
half
fierce
did
he
send
them
dowson
they
are
a
present
from
me
dowson
answered
comfortably
and
robin
said
again
i
want
to
kiss
you
i
like
to
kiss
you
i
do
to
those
given
to
psychical
interests
and
speculations
it
might
have
suggested
itself
that
on
the
night
when
the
creature
who
had
seemed
to
andrews
a
soft
tissued
puppet
had
suddenly
burst
forth
into
defiance
and
fearless
shrillness
some
cerebral
change
had
taken
place
in
her
from
that
hour
her
softness
had
become
a
thing
of
the
past
dowson
had
not
found
a
baby
but
a
brooding
little
passionate
being
she
was
neither
insubordinate
nor
irritable
but
dowson
was
conscious
of
a
certain
intensity
of
temperament
in
her
she
knew
that
she
was
always
thinking
of
things
of
which
she
said
almost
nothing
only
a
sensible
motherly
curiosity
such
as
dowson
could
have
made
discoveries
but
a
rare
question
put
by
the
child
at
long
intervals
sometimes
threw
a
faint
light
there
were
questions
chiefly
concerning
mothers
and
their
habits
and
customs
they
were
such
as
in
their
very
unconsciousness
revealed
a
strange
past
history
lights
were
most
unconsciously
thrown
by
herself
her
quite
amiable
detachment
from
all
shadow
of
responsibility
her
brilliantly
unending
occupations
her
goings
in
and
out
the
flocks
of
light
almost
noisy
intimates
who
came
in
and
out
with
her
revealed
much
to
a
respectable
person
who
had
soberly
watched
the
world
the
lady
downstairs
is
my
mother
is
she
robin
inquired
gravely
once
yes
my
dear
was
dowson
answer
a
pause
for
consideration
of
the
matter
and
then
from
robin
all
mothers
are
not
alike
dowson
are
they
no
my
dear
with
wisdom
though
she
was
not
yet
seven
life
had
so
changed
for
her
that
it
was
a
far
cry
back
to
the
spring
days
in
the
square
gardens
she
went
back
however
back
into
that
remote
ecstatic
past
the
lady
downstairs
is
not
alike
she
said
at
last
mother
loved
him
she
let
him
sit
in
the
same
chair
with
her
and
read
in
picture
books
she
kissed
him
when
he
was
in
bed
jennings
the
young
footman
who
was
a
humourist
had
of
course
heard
witty
references
to
robin
love
affair
while
in
attendance
and
he
had
equally
of
course
repeated
them
below
stairs
therefore
dowson
had
heard
vague
rumours
but
had
tactfully
refrained
from
mentioning
the
subject
to
her
charge
who
was
donal
she
said
now
but
quite
quietly
robin
did
not
know
that
a
confidante
would
have
made
her
first
agony
easier
to
bear
she
was
not
really
being
confidential
now
but
realizing
dowson
comfortable
kindliness
she
knew
that
it
would
be
safe
to
speak
to
her
he
was
a
big
boy
she
answered
keeping
her
eyes
on
face
he
laughed
and
ran
and
jumped
his
eyes
she
stopped
there
because
she
could
not
explain
what
she
had
wanted
to
say
about
these
joyous
young
eyes
which
were
the
first
friendly
human
ones
she
had
known
he
lives
in
scotland
she
began
again
his
mother
loved
him
he
kissed
me
he
went
away
lord
coombe
sent
him
dawson
could
not
help
her
start
lord
coombe
she
exclaimed
robin
came
close
to
her
and
ground
her
little
fist
into
her
knee
until
its
plumpness
felt
almost
bruised
he
is
bad
bad
bad
and
she
looked
like
a
little
demon
being
a
wise
woman
dowson
knew
at
once
that
she
had
come
upon
a
hidden
child
volcano
and
it
would
be
well
to
let
it
seethe
into
silence
she
was
not
a
clever
person
but
long
experience
had
taught
her
that
there
were
occasions
when
it
was
well
to
leave
a
child
alone
this
one
would
not
answer
if
she
were
questioned
she
would
only
become
stubborn
and
furious
and
no
child
should
be
goaded
into
fury
dowson
had
of
course
learned
that
the
boy
was
a
relative
of
his
lordship
and
had
a
strict
scottish
mother
who
did
not
approve
of
the
slice
of
a
house
his
lordship
might
have
been
concerned
in
the
matter
or
he
might
not
but
at
least
dowson
had
gained
a
side
light
and
how
the
little
thing
had
cared
actually
as
if
she
had
been
a
grown
girl
dowson
found
herself
thinking
uneasily
she
was
rendered
even
a
trifle
more
uneasy
a
few
days
later
when
she
came
upon
robin
sitting
in
a
corner
on
a
footstool
with
a
picture
book
on
her
knee
and
she
recognized
it
as
the
one
she
had
discovered
during
her
first
exploitation
of
the
resources
of
the
third
floor
nursery
it
was
inscribed
donal
and
robin
was
not
looking
at
it
alone
but
at
something
she
held
in
her
hand
something
folded
in
a
crumpled
untidy
bit
of
paper
making
a
reason
for
nearing
her
corner
dowson
saw
what
the
paper
held
the
contents
looked
like
the
broken
fragments
of
some
dried
leaves
the
child
was
gazing
at
them
with
a
piteous
bewildered
face
so
piteous
that
dowson
was
sorry
do
you
want
to
keep
those
she
asked
yes
with
a
caught
breath
yes
i
will
make
you
a
little
silk
bag
to
hold
them
in
dowson
said
actually
feeling
rather
piteous
herself
the
poor
little
lamb
with
her
picture
book
and
her
bits
of
broken
dry
leaves
almost
like
senna
she
sat
down
near
her
and
robin
left
her
footstool
and
came
to
her
she
laid
the
picture
book
on
her
lap
and
the
senna
like
fragments
of
leaves
on
its
open
page
donal
brought
it
to
show
me
she
quavered
he
made
pretty
things
on
the
leaves
with
his
dirk
she
recalled
too
much
too
much
all
at
once
her
eyes
grew
rounder
and
larger
with
inescapable
woe
donal
did
donal
and
suddenly
she
hid
her
face
deep
in
skirts
and
the
tempest
broke
she
was
so
small
a
thing
so
inarticulate
and
these
were
her
dead
dowson
could
only
catch
her
in
her
arms
drag
her
up
on
her
knee
and
rock
her
to
and
fro
good
lord
good
lord
was
her
inward
ejaculation
and
she
not
seven
what
she
do
when
she
seventeen
she
one
of
them
there
no
help
for
it
was
the
beginning
of
an
affection
after
this
when
dowson
tucked
robin
in
bed
each
night
she
kissed
her
she
told
her
stories
and
taught
her
to
sew
and
to
know
her
letters
using
some
discretion
she
found
certain
little
playmates
for
her
in
the
gardens
but
there
were
occasions
when
all
did
not
go
well
and
some
pretty
friendly
child
who
had
played
with
robin
for
a
few
days
suddenly
seemed
to
be
kept
strictly
by
her
nurse
side
once
when
she
was
about
ten
years
old
a
newcomer
a
dramatic
and
too
richly
dressed
little
person
after
a
day
of
wonderful
imaginative
playing
appeared
in
the
gardens
the
morning
following
to
turn
an
ostentatious
cold
shoulder
what
is
the
matter
asked
robin
oh
we
ca
play
with
you
any
more
with
quite
a
flounce
superiority
why
not
said
robin
becoming
haughty
herself
we
ca
it
because
of
lord
coombe
the
little
person
had
really
no
definite
knowledge
of
how
lord
coombe
was
concerned
but
certain
servants
whisperings
of
names
and
mysterious
phrases
had
conveyed
quite
an
enjoyable
effect
of
unknown
iniquity
connected
with
his
lordship
robin
said
nothing
to
dowson
but
walked
up
and
down
the
paths
reflecting
and
building
a
slow
fire
which
would
continue
to
burn
in
her
young
heart
she
had
by
then
passed
the
round
soft
baby
period
and
had
entered
into
that
phase
when
bodies
and
legs
grow
long
and
slender
and
small
faces
lose
their
first
curves
and
begin
to
show
sharper
modeling
accepting
the
situation
in
its
entirety
dowson
had
seen
that
it
was
well
to
first
reach
lord
coombe
with
any
need
of
the
child
afterwards
the
form
of
presenting
it
to
must
be
gone
through
but
if
she
were
first
spoken
to
any
suggestion
might
be
forgotten
or
intentionally
ignored
dowson
became
clever
in
her
calculations
as
to
when
his
lordship
might
be
encountered
and
where
as
if
by
chance
and
therefore
quite
respectfully
sometimes
she
remotely
wondered
if
he
himself
did
not
make
such
encounters
easy
for
her
but
his
manner
never
altered
in
its
somewhat
stiff
expressionless
chill
of
indifference
he
never
was
kindly
in
his
manner
to
the
child
if
he
met
her
dowson
felt
him
at
once
casual
and
lofty
robin
might
have
been
a
bit
of
unconsidered
rubbish
the
sight
of
which
slightly
bored
him
yet
the
singular
fact
remained
that
it
was
to
him
one
must
carefully
appeal
one
afternoon
feather
swept
him
with
one
or
two
others
into
the
with
the
round
window
in
which
flowers
grew
robin
was
sitting
at
a
low
table
making
pothooks
with
a
lead
pencil
on
a
piece
of
paper
dowson
had
given
her
dowson
had
in
fact
set
her
at
the
task
having
heard
from
jennings
that
his
lordship
and
the
other
afternoon
tea
drinkers
were
to
be
brought
into
the
palace
as
feather
ironically
chose
to
call
it
jennings
rather
liked
dowson
and
often
told
her
little
things
she
wanted
to
know
it
was
because
lord
coombe
would
probably
come
in
with
the
rest
that
dowson
had
set
the
low
white
table
in
the
round
windows
and
suggested
the
pothooks
in
course
of
time
there
was
a
fluttering
and
a
chatter
in
the
corridor
feather
was
bringing
some
new
guests
who
had
not
seen
the
place
before
this
is
where
my
daughter
lives
she
is
much
grander
than
i
am
she
said
stand
up
miss
robin
and
make
your
curtsey
whispered
dowson
robin
did
as
she
was
told
and
pretty
brows
ran
up
look
at
her
legs
she
said
she
growing
like
jack
and
the
bean
stalk
though
i
suppose
it
was
only
the
bean
stalk
that
grew
she
stick
through
the
top
of
the
house
soon
look
at
her
legs
i
ask
you
she
always
spoke
as
if
the
child
were
an
inanimate
object
and
she
had
by
this
time
and
by
this
means
managed
to
sweep
from
mind
all
the
old
babyish
worship
of
her
loveliness
and
had
planted
in
its
place
another
feeling
at
this
moment
the
other
feeling
surged
and
burned
they
are
beautiful
legs
remarked
a
laughing
young
man
jocularly
but
perhaps
she
does
not
particularly
want
us
to
look
at
them
wait
until
she
begins
skirt
dancing
and
everybody
laughed
at
once
and
the
child
stood
rigid
the
object
of
their
light
ridicule
not
herself
knowing
that
her
whole
little
being
was
cursing
them
aloud
coombe
stepped
to
the
little
table
and
bestowed
a
casual
glance
on
the
pencil
marks
what
is
she
doing
he
asked
as
casually
of
dowson
she
is
learning
to
make
pothooks
my
lord
dowson
answered
she
a
child
that
wants
to
be
learning
things
i
taught
her
her
letters
and
to
spell
little
words
she
quick
and
old
enough
your
lordship
learning
to
read
and
write
exclaimed
feather
presumption
i
call
it
i
do
know
how
to
read
and
write
least
i
do
know
how
to
spell
do
you
know
how
to
spell
collie
to
the
young
man
whose
name
was
colin
do
you
genevieve
do
you
artie
you
ca
betray
me
into
vulgar
boasting
said
collie
who
does
in
these
days
nobody
but
clerks
at
peter
robinson
lord
coombe
does
but
that
his
tiresome
superior
way
said
feather
he
nearly
forty
years
older
than
most
of
you
that
is
the
reason
coombe
commented
do
deplore
your
youth
and
innocence
they
swept
through
the
rooms
and
examined
everything
in
them
the
truth
was
that
the
by
this
time
well
known
fact
that
the
unexplainable
coombe
had
built
them
made
them
a
curiosity
and
a
sort
of
secret
source
of
jokes
the
party
even
mounted
to
the
upper
story
to
go
through
the
bedrooms
and
it
was
while
they
were
doing
this
that
coombe
chose
to
linger
behind
with
dowson
he
remained
entirely
expressionless
for
a
few
moments
dowson
did
not
in
the
least
gather
whether
he
meant
to
speak
to
her
or
not
but
he
did
you
meant
he
scarcely
glanced
at
her
that
she
was
old
enough
for
a
governess
yes
my
lord
rather
breathless
in
her
hurry
to
speak
before
she
heard
the
high
heels
tapping
on
the
staircase
again
and
one
that
a
good
woman
as
well
as
clever
if
i
may
take
the
liberty
a
good
one
if
if
a
good
one
would
take
the
place
dowson
did
not
attempt
refutation
or
apology
she
knew
better
he
said
no
more
but
sauntered
out
of
the
room
as
he
did
so
robin
stood
up
and
made
the
little
charity
bob
of
a
curtsey
which
had
been
part
of
her
nursery
education
she
was
too
old
now
to
have
refused
him
her
hand
but
he
never
made
any
advances
to
her
he
acknowledged
her
curtsey
with
the
briefest
nod
not
three
minutes
later
the
high
heels
came
tapping
down
the
staircase
and
the
small
gust
of
visitors
swept
away
also
chapter
xvi
the
interview
which
took
place
between
feather
and
lord
coombe
a
few
days
later
had
its
own
special
character
a
governess
will
come
here
tomorrow
at
eleven
he
said
she
is
a
mademoiselle
valle
she
is
accustomed
to
the
educating
of
young
children
she
will
present
herself
for
your
approval
benby
has
done
all
the
rest
feather
flushed
to
her
hair
what
on
earth
can
it
matter
she
cried
it
does
not
matter
to
you
he
answered
it
chances
for
the
time
being
to
matter
to
me
chances
she
flamed
forth
it
was
really
a
queer
little
flame
of
feeling
that
it
you
do
really
care
it
a
caprice
just
because
you
see
she
is
going
to
be
pretty
i
own
he
admitted
that
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
it
has
everything
to
do
with
it
she
threw
out
if
she
had
a
snub
nose
and
thick
legs
you
would
care
for
her
at
all
i
do
say
that
i
do
care
for
her
without
emotion
the
situation
interests
me
here
is
an
extraordinary
little
being
thrown
into
the
world
she
belongs
to
nobody
she
will
have
to
fight
for
her
own
hand
and
she
will
have
to
fight
by
god
with
that
dewy
lure
in
her
eyes
and
her
curved
pomegranate
mouth
she
will
not
know
but
she
will
draw
disaster
then
she
had
better
not
be
taught
anything
at
all
said
feather
it
would
be
an
amusing
thing
to
let
her
grow
up
without
learning
to
read
or
write
at
all
i
know
numbers
of
men
who
would
like
the
novelty
of
it
girls
who
know
so
much
are
a
bore
there
are
a
few
minor
chances
she
ought
to
have
said
coombe
a
governess
is
one
mademoiselle
valle
will
be
here
at
eleven
i
ca
see
that
she
promises
to
be
such
a
beauty
fretted
feather
she
the
kind
of
good
looking
child
who
might
grow
up
into
a
fat
girl
with
staring
black
eyes
like
a
barmaid
occasionally
pretty
women
do
abhor
their
growing
up
daughters
commented
coombe
letting
his
eyes
rest
on
her
interestedly
i
do
abhor
her
with
pathos
touched
with
venom
but
a
big
lumping
girl
hanging
about
ogling
and
wanting
to
be
ogled
when
she
is
passing
through
that
silly
age
and
sometimes
you
speak
to
me
as
a
man
speaks
to
his
wife
when
he
is
tired
of
her
i
beg
your
pardon
coombe
said
you
make
me
feel
like
a
person
who
lives
over
a
shop
at
knightsbridge
or
in
bijou
mansion
off
regent
park
but
he
was
deeply
aware
that
as
an
outcome
of
the
anomalous
position
he
occupied
he
not
infrequently
felt
exactly
this
that
a
governess
chosen
by
coombe
though
he
would
seem
not
to
appear
in
the
matter
would
preside
over
the
new
rooms
feather
knew
without
a
shadow
of
doubt
a
certain
almost
silent
and
always
dominance
over
her
existence
she
accepted
as
the
inevitable
even
while
she
fretted
helplessly
without
him
she
would
be
tossed
a
broken
butterfly
into
the
gutter
she
knew
her
london
no
one
would
pick
her
up
unless
to
break
her
into
smaller
atoms
and
toss
her
away
again
the
freedom
he
allowed
her
after
all
was
wonderful
it
was
because
he
disdained
interference
but
there
was
a
line
not
to
be
crossed
there
must
not
even
be
an
attempt
at
crossing
it
why
he
cared
about
that
she
did
not
know
you
must
be
like
caesar
wife
he
said
rather
grimly
after
an
interview
in
which
he
had
given
her
a
certain
unsparing
warning
and
i
am
nobody
wife
what
did
caesar
wife
do
she
asked
nothing
and
he
told
her
the
story
and
when
she
had
heard
him
tell
it
she
understood
certain
things
clearly
mademoiselle
valle
was
an
intelligent
mature
frenchwoman
she
presented
herself
to
for
inspection
and
in
ten
minutes
realized
that
the
power
to
inspect
and
sum
up
existed
only
on
her
own
side
this
pretty
woman
neither
knew
what
inquiries
to
make
nor
cared
for
such
replies
as
were
given
being
swift
to
reason
and
practical
in
deduction
mademoiselle
valle
did
not
make
the
blunder
of
deciding
that
this
light
presence
argued
that
she
would
be
under
no
supervision
more
serious
the
excellent
benby
one
was
made
aware
acted
and
the
excellent
benby
one
was
made
aware
acted
under
clearly
defined
orders
milord
coombe
among
other
things
the
best
dressed
and
perhaps
the
least
comprehended
man
in
london
was
concerned
in
this
though
on
what
grounds
practical
persons
could
not
explain
to
themselves
his
connection
with
the
narrow
house
on
the
right
side
of
the
right
street
was
entirely
comprehensible
the
lenient
felt
nothing
blatant
or
objectionable
about
it
mademoiselle
valle
herself
was
not
disturbed
by
mere
rumour
the
education
manner
and
morals
of
the
little
girl
she
could
account
for
these
alone
were
to
be
her
affair
and
she
was
competent
to
undertake
their
superintendence
therefore
she
sat
and
listened
with
respectful
intelligence
to
the
birdlike
chatter
of
what
a
pretty
woman
the
silhouette
of
a
jeune
fille
felt
that
on
her
part
she
had
done
all
that
was
required
of
her
i
afraid
she
rather
a
dull
child
mademoiselle
she
said
in
farewell
you
know
children
ways
and
you
understand
what
i
mean
she
has
a
trick
of
staring
and
saying
nothing
i
confess
i
wish
she
was
dull
it
is
impossible
madame
that
she
should
be
dull
said
mademoiselle
with
an
agreeably
implicating
smile
oh
but
quite
impossible
we
shall
see
not
many
days
had
passed
before
she
had
seen
much
at
the
outset
she
recognized
the
effect
of
the
little
girl
with
the
slender
legs
and
feet
and
the
dozen
or
so
of
points
which
go
to
make
a
beauty
the
intense
eyes
first
and
the
deeps
of
them
they
gave
one
furiously
to
think
before
making
up
one
mind
then
she
noted
the
perfection
of
the
rooms
added
to
the
smartly
inconvenient
little
house
where
had
the
child
lived
before
the
addition
had
been
built
thought
and
actual
architectural
genius
only
could
have
done
this
light
and
even
as
much
sunshine
as
london
will
vouchsafe
had
been
arranged
for
comfort
convenience
luxury
had
been
provided
perfect
colour
and
excellent
texture
had
evoked
actual
charm
its
utter
unlikeness
to
the
quarters
london
usually
gives
to
children
even
of
the
fortunate
class
struck
mademoiselle
valle
at
once
madame
had
not
done
this
who
then
had
the
good
dowson
she
at
once
affiliated
with
she
knew
the
excellence
of
her
type
as
it
had
revealed
itself
to
her
in
the
best
peasant
class
trustworthy
simple
but
of
kindly
shrewd
good
sense
and
with
the
power
to
observe
dowson
was
not
a
chatterer
or
given
to
gossip
but
as
a
silent
observer
she
would
know
many
things
and
in
time
when
they
had
become
friendly
enough
to
be
fully
aware
that
each
might
trust
the
other
gentle
and
careful
talk
would
end
in
unconscious
revelation
being
made
by
dowson
that
the
little
girl
was
almost
singularly
attached
to
her
nurse
she
had
marked
early
there
was
something
unusual
in
her
manifestations
of
her
feeling
the
intense
eyes
followed
the
woman
often
as
if
making
sure
of
her
presence
and
reality
the
first
day
of
mademoiselle
residence
in
the
place
she
saw
the
little
thing
suddenly
stop
playing
with
her
doll
and
look
at
dowson
earnestly
for
several
moments
then
she
left
her
seat
and
went
to
the
kind
creature
side
i
want
to
kiss
you
dowie
she
said
to
be
sure
my
lamb
answered
dowson
and
laying
down
her
mending
she
gave
her
a
motherly
hug
after
which
robin
went
back
contentedly
to
her
play
the
frenchwoman
thought
it
a
pretty
bit
of
childish
affectionateness
but
it
happened
more
than
once
during
the
day
and
at
night
mademoiselle
commented
upon
it
she
has
an
affectionate
heart
the
little
one
she
remarked
madame
her
mother
is
so
pretty
and
full
of
gaieties
and
pleasures
that
i
should
not
have
imagined
she
had
much
time
for
caresses
and
the
nursery
even
by
this
time
dowson
had
realized
that
with
mademoiselle
she
was
upon
safe
ground
and
was
in
no
danger
of
betraying
herself
to
a
gossip
she
quietly
laid
down
her
sewing
and
looked
at
her
companion
with
grave
eyes
her
mother
has
never
kissed
her
in
her
life
that
i
am
aware
of
she
said
has
never
mademoiselle
ejaculated
never
just
as
you
see
her
she
is
mademoiselle
dowson
said
any
sensible
woman
would
know
when
she
heard
her
talk
about
her
child
i
found
it
all
out
bit
by
bit
when
first
i
came
here
going
to
talk
plain
and
have
done
with
it
her
first
six
years
she
spent
in
a
sort
of
dog
kennel
on
the
top
floor
of
this
house
no
sun
no
real
fresh
air
two
little
holes
that
were
dingy
and
gloomy
to
dull
a
child
senses
not
a
toy
or
a
bit
of
colour
or
a
picture
but
clothes
fine
enough
for
buckingham
palace
children
and
enough
for
six
fed
and
washed
and
taken
out
every
day
to
be
shown
off
and
a
bad
nurse
miss
a
bad
one
that
kept
her
quiet
by
pinching
her
black
and
blue
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
that
little
angel
cried
mademoiselle
covering
her
eyes
dowson
hastily
wiped
her
own
eyes
she
had
shed
many
a
motherly
tear
over
the
child
it
was
a
relief
to
her
to
open
her
heart
to
a
sympathizer
black
and
blue
she
repeated
and
laughing
and
dancing
and
all
sorts
of
fast
fun
going
on
in
the
she
put
out
her
hand
and
touched
mademoiselle
arm
quite
fiercely
the
little
thing
did
know
she
had
a
mother
she
did
know
what
the
word
meant
i
found
that
out
by
her
innocent
talk
she
used
to
call
her
lady
downstairs
mon
dieu
cried
the
frenchwoman
again
what
a
woman
she
first
heard
of
mothers
from
a
little
boy
she
met
in
the
square
gardens
he
was
the
first
child
she
had
been
allowed
to
play
with
he
was
a
nice
child
and
he
had
a
good
mother
i
only
got
it
bit
by
bit
when
she
did
know
how
much
she
was
telling
me
he
told
her
about
mothers
and
he
kissed
her
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
did
understand
but
it
warmed
her
little
heart
never
forgotten
mademoiselle
even
started
slightly
in
her
chair
being
a
clever
frenchwoman
she
felt
drama
and
all
its
subtle
accompaniments
is
that
why
she
began
it
is
answered
dowson
stoutly
a
kiss
is
an
ordinary
thing
to
her
it
means
something
wonderful
she
got
into
the
way
of
loving
me
bless
her
and
every
now
and
then
it
my
opinion
she
suddenly
remembers
her
lonely
days
when
she
did
know
what
love
was
and
it
just
wells
up
in
her
little
heart
and
she
wants
to
kiss
me
she
always
says
it
that
way
i
want
to
kiss
you
as
if
it
was
something
strange
and
so
to
say
sacred
she
does
know
it
means
almost
nothing
to
most
people
that
why
i
always
lay
down
my
work
and
hug
her
close
you
have
a
good
heart
a
good
one
said
mademoiselle
with
strong
feeling
then
she
put
a
question
who
was
the
little
boy
he
was
a
relation
of
his
lordship
his
lordship
cautiously
the
marquis
lord
coombe
there
was
a
few
minutes
silence
both
women
were
thinking
of
a
number
of
things
and
each
was
asking
herself
how
much
it
would
be
wise
to
say
it
was
dowson
who
made
her
decision
first
and
this
time
as
before
she
laid
down
her
work
what
she
had
to
convey
was
the
thing
which
above
all
others
the
frenchwoman
must
understand
if
she
was
to
be
able
to
use
her
power
to
its
best
effect
a
woman
in
my
place
hears
enough
talk
was
her
beginning
servants
are
given
to
it
the
servants
hall
is
their
theatre
it
matter
whether
tales
are
true
or
not
so
that
they
spicy
but
it
been
my
way
to
credit
just
as
much
as
i
see
and
know
and
to
say
little
about
that
if
a
woman
takes
a
place
in
a
house
let
her
go
or
stay
as
suits
her
best
but
do
let
her
stay
and
either
complain
or
gossip
my
business
here
is
miss
robin
and
i
found
out
for
myself
that
there
just
one
person
that
in
a
queer
unfeeling
way
of
his
own
has
a
fancy
for
looking
after
her
i
say
because
he
never
shows
any
human
signs
of
caring
for
the
child
himself
but
if
there
a
thing
that
ought
to
be
done
for
her
and
a
body
can
contrive
to
let
him
know
it
needed
it
be
done
downstairs
talk
that
i
seemed
to
pay
no
attention
to
has
let
out
that
it
was
him
that
walked
quietly
upstairs
to
the
nursery
where
he
never
set
foot
before
and
opened
the
door
on
andrews
pinching
the
child
she
packed
her
box
and
left
that
night
he
inspected
the
nurseries
and
in
a
few
days
an
architect
was
planning
these
rooms
for
miss
robin
and
for
no
one
else
though
there
was
others
wanted
them
it
was
him
that
told
me
to
order
her
books
and
playthings
and
not
let
her
know
it
because
she
hates
him
it
was
him
i
told
she
needed
a
governess
and
he
found
you
mademoiselle
valle
had
listened
with
profound
attention
here
she
spoke
you
say
continually
or
he
is
lord
coombe
i
not
saying
i
seen
much
of
him
considering
dowson
paused
it
queer
how
seldom
he
comes
here
he
goes
abroad
a
good
deal
he
mixed
up
with
the
highest
and
it
said
he
in
favour
because
he
satirical
and
clever
he
one
gossiped
about
and
he
cares
nothing
for
what
said
what
business
of
mine
is
it
whether
or
not
he
has
all
sorts
of
dens
on
the
continent
where
he
goes
to
racket
he
might
be
a
bishop
for
all
i
see
and
he
the
only
creature
in
this
world
of
the
that
remembers
that
child
a
human
being
just
him
lord
coombe
there
mademoiselle
i
said
a
good
deal
more
and
more
interestedly
had
the
frenchwoman
listened
and
with
an
increasing
hint
of
curiosity
in
her
intelligent
eyes
she
pressed
dowson
fingers
warmly
you
have
not
said
too
much
it
is
well
that
i
should
know
this
of
this
gentleman
as
you
say
he
is
a
man
who
is
much
discussed
i
myself
have
heard
much
of
him
but
of
things
connected
with
another
part
of
his
character
it
is
true
that
he
is
in
favour
with
great
personages
it
is
because
they
are
aware
that
he
has
observed
much
for
many
years
he
is
light
and
ironic
but
he
tells
truths
which
sometimes
startle
those
who
hear
them
jennings
tells
below
stairs
that
he
says
things
it
queer
for
a
lord
to
say
jennings
is
a
sharp
young
snip
and
likes
to
pick
up
things
to
repeat
he
believes
that
his
lordship
idea
is
that
there
a
time
coming
when
the
high
ones
will
lose
their
places
and
thrones
and
kings
will
be
done
away
with
i
would
like
to
go
that
far
myself
said
dowson
gravely
but
i
must
say
that
there
not
that
serious
respect
paid
to
royalty
that
there
was
in
my
young
days
my
word
when
queen
victoria
was
in
her
prime
with
all
her
young
family
around
her
their
little
royal
highnesses
that
were
princes
in
their
highland
kilts
and
the
princesses
in
their
crinolines
and
hats
with
drooping
ostrich
feathers
and
broad
satin
streamers
the
people
just
went
wild
when
she
went
to
a
place
to
unveil
anything
when
the
empress
eugenie
and
the
prince
imperial
appeared
it
was
the
same
thing
said
mademoiselle
a
trifle
sadly
one
recalls
it
now
as
a
dream
passed
away
the
champs
elysees
in
the
afternoon
sunlight
the
imperial
carriage
and
the
glittering
escort
trotting
gaily
the
beautiful
woman
with
the
always
beautiful
costumes
her
charming
smile
the
emperor
with
his
waxed
moustache
and
saturnine
face
it
meant
so
much
and
it
went
so
quickly
one
moment
she
made
a
little
gesture
and
it
is
gone
forever
an
empire
and
all
the
splendour
of
it
two
centuries
ago
it
could
not
have
disappeared
so
quickly
but
now
the
world
is
older
it
does
not
need
toys
so
much
a
republic
is
the
people
and
there
are
more
people
than
kings
it
things
like
that
his
lordship
says
according
to
jennings
said
dowson
jennings
is
never
quite
sure
he
in
earnest
he
has
a
satirical
way
and
the
company
always
laugh
mademoiselle
had
spoken
thoughtfully
and
as
if
half
to
her
inner
self
instead
of
to
dowson
she
added
something
even
more
thoughtfully
now
the
same
kind
of
people
laughed
before
the
french
revolution
she
murmured
i
not
scholar
enough
to
know
much
about
that
that
was
a
long
time
ago
was
it
dowson
remarked
a
long
time
ago
said
mademoiselle
dowson
reply
was
quite
free
from
tragic
reminiscence
well
i
must
say
i
like
a
respectable
royal
family
myself
she
observed
there
something
solid
and
comfortable
about
it
besides
the
coronations
and
weddings
and
procession
with
all
the
pictures
in
the
illustrated
london
news
give
me
a
nice
royal
family
chapter
xvii
a
nice
royal
family
there
had
been
several
of
them
in
europe
for
some
time
an
appreciable
number
of
them
had
prided
themselves
even
a
shade
ostentatiously
upon
their
domesticity
the
moral
views
of
a
few
had
been
believed
to
border
upon
the
high
principles
inscribed
in
copy
books
some
however
had
not
a
more
important
power
or
so
had
veered
from
the
exact
following
of
these
commendable
axioms
had
behaved
according
to
their
royal
will
and
tastes
but
what
would
you
with
a
nation
making
proper
obeisance
before
one
from
infancy
with
trumpets
blaring
forth
joyous
strains
upon
one
mere
appearance
on
any
scene
with
the
proudest
necks
bowed
and
the
most
superb
curtseys
swept
on
one
mere
passing
by
with
all
the
splendour
of
the
opera
on
gala
night
rising
to
its
feet
to
salute
one
mere
entry
into
the
royal
or
imperial
box
while
the
national
anthem
bursts
forth
with
adulatory
and
triumphant
strains
only
a
keen
and
subtle
sense
of
humour
surely
could
curb
errors
of
judgment
arising
from
naturally
mistaken
views
of
one
own
importance
and
value
to
the
entire
universe
still
there
remained
the
fact
that
a
number
of
them
were
and
could
not
be
complained
of
as
bearing
any
likeness
to
the
bloodthirsty
tyrants
and
oppressors
of
past
centuries
the
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
had
attended
the
court
functions
and
been
received
at
the
palaces
and
castles
of
most
of
them
for
in
that
aspect
of
his
character
of
which
mademoiselle
valle
had
heard
more
than
dowson
he
was
intimate
with
and
personages
and
places
a
man
born
among
those
whose
daily
life
builds
as
it
passes
at
least
a
part
of
that
which
makes
history
and
so
records
itself
must
needs
find
companions
acquaintances
enemies
friends
of
varied
character
and
if
he
be
by
chance
a
keen
observer
of
passing
panoramas
can
lack
no
material
for
private
reflection
and
the
accumulation
of
important
facts
that
part
of
his
existence
which
connected
itself
with
the
slice
of
a
house
on
the
right
side
of
the
mayfair
street
was
but
a
small
one
a
feature
of
the
untranslatableness
of
his
character
was
that
he
was
seen
there
but
seldom
his
early
habit
of
crossing
the
channel
frequently
had
gradually
reestablished
itself
as
years
passed
among
his
acquaintances
his
saturday
to
monday
visits
to
continental
cities
remote
or
unremote
were
discussed
with
humour
possibly
upon
these
discussions
were
finally
founded
the
rumours
of
which
dowson
had
heard
but
which
she
had
impartially
declined
to
credit
lively
conjecture
inevitably
figured
largely
in
their
arguments
and
when
persons
of
unrestrained
wit
devote
their
attention
to
airy
persiflage
much
may
be
included
in
their
points
of
view
of
these
conjectural
discussions
no
one
was
more
clearly
aware
than
coombe
himself
and
the
finished
facility
even
felicity
of
his
evasion
of
any
attempt
at
delicately
valued
cross
examination
was
felt
to
be
inhumanly
exasperating
in
one
of
the
older
squares
which
still
remained
stately
through
the
splendour
of
modern
fashion
had
waned
in
its
neighbourhood
there
was
among
the
gloomy
though
imposing
houses
one
in
particular
upon
whose
broad
doorsteps
years
before
the
had
appeared
in
london
lord
coombe
stood
oftener
than
upon
any
other
at
times
his
brougham
waited
before
it
for
hours
and
at
others
he
appeared
on
foot
and
lifted
the
heavy
knocker
with
a
special
accustomed
knock
recognized
at
once
by
any
footman
in
waiting
in
the
hall
who
hearing
it
knew
that
his
mistress
the
old
dowager
duchess
of
darte
would
receive
this
visitor
if
no
other
the
interior
of
the
house
was
of
the
type
which
having
from
the
first
been
massive
and
richly
sombre
had
mellowed
into
a
darker
sombreness
and
richness
as
it
had
stood
unmoved
amid
london
years
and
fogs
the
grandeur
of
decoration
and
furnishing
had
been
too
solid
to
depreciate
through
decay
and
its
owner
had
been
of
no
fickle
mind
led
to
waver
in
taste
by
whims
of
fashion
the
rooms
were
huge
and
lofty
the
halls
and
stairways
spacious
the
fireplaces
furnished
with
immense
grates
of
glittering
steel
which
held
in
winter
beds
of
scarlet
glowing
coal
kept
scarlet
glowing
by
a
special
footman
whose
being
so
to
speak
depended
on
his
fidelity
to
his
task
there
were
many
rooms
whose
doors
were
kept
closed
because
they
were
apparently
never
used
there
were
others
as
little
used
but
thrown
open
warmed
and
brightened
with
flowers
each
day
because
the
duchess
chose
to
catch
glimpses
of
their
cheerfulness
as
she
passed
them
on
her
way
up
or
downstairs
the
house
was
her
own
property
and
after
her
widowhood
when
it
was
emptied
of
her
children
by
their
admirable
marriages
and
she
herself
became
dowager
and
later
a
confirmed
rheumatic
invalid
it
became
doubly
her
home
and
was
governed
by
her
slightest
whim
she
was
not
indeed
an
old
woman
of
caprices
but
her
tastes
not
being
those
of
the
later
day
in
which
she
now
lived
were
regarded
as
a
shade
eccentric
being
firmly
defined
i
will
not
have
my
house
glaring
with
electricity
as
if
it
were
a
shop
in
my
own
rooms
i
will
be
lighted
by
wax
candles
large
ones
as
many
as
you
please
she
said
i
will
not
be
by
telephone
my
servants
may
if
they
like
it
is
not
my
affair
to
deprive
them
of
the
modern
inconveniences
if
they
find
them
convenient
my
senility
does
not
take
the
form
of
insisting
that
the
world
shall
cease
to
revolve
upon
its
axis
it
formed
that
habit
without
my
assistance
and
it
is
to
be
feared
that
it
would
continue
it
in
the
face
of
my
protests
it
was
in
fact
solely
that
portion
of
the
world
affecting
herself
alone
which
she
preferred
to
retain
as
it
had
been
in
the
brilliant
early
years
of
her
life
she
had
been
a
great
beauty
and
also
a
wit
in
the
court
over
which
queen
victoria
had
reigned
she
had
possessed
the
delicate
high
nose
the
soft
full
eyes
the
polished
forehead
the
sloping
white
shoulders
from
which
scarves
floated
or
india
shawls
gracefully
drooped
in
the
books
of
beauty
of
the
day
her
carriage
had
been
noble
her
bloom
perfect
and
when
she
had
driven
through
the
streets
in
attendance
on
her
royal
mistress
the
populace
had
always
chosen
her
as
the
pick
of
all
young
as
she
had
then
been
elderly
statesmen
had
found
her
worth
talking
to
not
as
a
mere
beauty
in
her
teens
but
as
a
creature
of
singular
brilliance
and
clarity
of
outlook
upon
a
world
which
might
have
dazzled
her
youth
the
most
renowned
among
them
had
said
of
her
before
she
was
twenty
that
she
would
live
to
be
one
of
the
cleverest
women
in
europe
and
that
she
had
already
the
logical
outlook
of
a
just
man
of
fifty
she
married
early
and
was
widowed
in
middle
life
in
her
later
years
rheumatic
fever
so
far
disabled
her
as
to
confine
her
to
her
chair
almost
entirely
her
sons
and
daughter
had
homes
and
families
of
their
own
to
engage
them
she
would
not
allow
them
to
sacrifice
themselves
to
her
because
her
life
had
altered
its
aspect
i
have
money
friends
good
servants
and
a
house
i
particularly
like
she
summed
the
matter
up
i
may
be
condemned
to
sit
by
the
fire
but
i
am
not
condemned
to
be
a
bore
to
my
inoffensive
family
i
can
still
talk
and
read
and
i
shall
train
myself
to
become
a
professional
listener
this
will
attract
i
shall
not
only
read
myself
but
i
will
be
read
to
a
strong
young
man
with
a
nice
voice
shall
bring
magazines
and
books
to
me
every
day
and
shall
read
the
best
things
aloud
delightful
people
will
drop
in
to
see
me
and
will
be
amazed
by
my
fund
of
information
it
was
during
the
first
years
of
her
enforced
seclusion
that
coombe
intimacy
with
her
began
he
had
known
her
during
certain
black
days
of
his
youth
and
she
had
comprehended
things
he
did
not
tell
her
she
had
not
spoken
of
them
to
him
but
she
had
silently
given
him
of
something
which
vaguely
drew
him
to
her
side
when
darkness
seemed
to
overwhelm
him
the
occupations
of
her
life
left
her
in
those
earlier
days
little
leisure
for
close
intimacies
but
when
she
began
to
sit
by
her
fire
letting
the
busy
world
pass
by
he
gradually
became
one
of
those
who
dropped
in
in
one
of
the
huge
rooms
she
had
chosen
for
her
own
daily
use
by
the
fire
in
its
shining
grate
she
had
created
an
agreeable
corner
where
she
sat
in
a
chair
marvellous
for
ease
and
comfort
enclosed
from
draughts
by
a
fire
screen
of
antique
chinese
lacquer
a
table
by
her
side
and
all
she
required
within
her
reach
upon
the
table
stood
a
silver
bell
and
at
its
sound
her
companion
her
reader
her
maid
or
her
personally
trained
footman
came
and
went
quietly
and
promptly
as
if
summoned
by
magic
her
life
itself
was
simple
but
a
certain
almost
royal
dignity
surrounded
her
loneliness
her
companion
miss
brent
an
intelligent
mature
woman
who
had
known
a
hard
and
pinched
life
found
at
once
comfort
and
savour
in
it
it
is
not
i
who
am
expensive
this
in
one
of
her
talks
with
coombe
but
to
live
in
a
house
of
this
size
well
kept
by
excellent
servants
who
are
satisfied
with
their
lot
is
not
a
frugal
thing
a
cap
of
tea
for
those
of
my
friends
who
run
in
to
warm
themselves
by
my
fire
in
the
afternoon
a
dinner
or
so
when
i
am
well
enough
to
sit
at
the
head
of
my
table
represent
almost
all
i
now
do
for
the
world
naturally
i
must
see
that
my
tea
is
good
and
that
my
dinners
can
not
be
objected
to
nevertheless
i
sit
here
in
my
chair
and
save
money
for
what
among
those
who
warmed
themselves
by
her
fire
this
man
had
singularly
become
her
friend
and
intimate
when
they
had
time
to
explore
each
other
minds
they
came
upon
curious
discoveries
of
hidden
sympathies
and
mutual
comprehensions
which
were
rich
treasures
they
talked
of
absorbing
things
with
frankness
he
came
to
sit
with
her
when
others
were
not
admitted
because
she
was
in
pain
or
fatigued
he
added
to
neither
her
fatigue
nor
her
pain
but
rather
helped
her
to
forget
them
for
what
he
answered
on
this
day
why
not
for
your
grandchildren
they
will
have
too
much
money
there
are
only
four
of
them
they
will
make
great
marriages
as
their
parents
did
she
said
she
paused
a
second
before
she
added
unless
our
world
revolution
has
broken
into
flame
by
that
time
and
there
are
no
longer
any
great
marriages
to
make
for
among
the
many
things
they
dwelt
on
in
their
talks
along
was
the
chessboard
which
was
the
map
of
europe
over
which
he
had
watched
for
many
years
certain
hands
hover
in
tentative
experimenting
as
to
the
possibilities
of
the
removal
of
the
pieces
from
one
square
to
another
she
too
from
her
youth
had
watched
the
game
with
an
interest
which
had
not
waned
in
her
maturity
and
which
in
her
days
of
sitting
by
the
fire
had
increased
with
every
move
the
hovering
hands
made
she
had
been
familiar
with
political
parties
and
their
leaders
she
had
met
heroes
and
statesmen
she
had
seen
an
unimportant
prince
become
an
emperor
who
from
his
green
and
boastful
youth
aspired
to
rule
the
world
and
whose
theatrical
obsession
had
been
the
sly
jest
of
unwary
nations
too
carelessly
sure
of
the
advance
of
civilization
and
too
indifferently
to
realize
that
a
monomaniac
even
if
treated
as
a
source
of
humour
is
a
perilous
thing
to
leave
unwatched
she
had
known
france
in
all
the
glitter
of
its
showy
empire
and
had
seen
its
imperial
glories
dispersed
as
mist
russia
she
had
watched
with
curiosity
and
dread
on
the
day
when
the
ruler
who
had
bestowed
freedom
on
millions
of
his
people
met
his
reward
in
the
shattering
bomb
which
tore
him
to
fragments
she
had
been
in
petersburg
a
king
who
had
been
assassinated
she
had
known
well
and
had
well
liked
an
empress
whom
a
frenzied
madman
had
stabbed
to
the
heart
had
been
her
friend
her
years
had
been
richly
full
of
varied
events
giving
a
strong
and
mind
reason
for
much
unspoken
thought
of
the
kind
which
leaps
in
advance
of
its
day
experience
and
exact
knowledge
she
had
learned
when
to
speak
and
when
to
be
silent
and
she
oftener
chose
silence
but
she
had
never
ceased
gazing
on
the
world
with
keen
eyes
and
reflecting
upon
its
virtues
and
vagaries
its
depths
and
its
shallows
with
the
help
of
a
clear
and
temperate
brain
by
her
fire
she
sat
an
attracting
presence
though
only
fine
strong
lines
remained
of
beauty
ravaged
by
illness
and
years
the
polished
forehead
was
furrowed
by
the
chisel
of
suffering
the
delicate
high
nose
springing
from
her
waxen
sunken
face
seemed
somewhat
eaglelike
but
the
face
was
still
brilliant
in
its
intensity
of
meaning
and
the
carriage
of
her
head
was
still
noble
not
able
to
walk
except
with
the
assistance
of
a
cane
her
once
exquisite
hands
stiffened
almost
to
uselessness
she
held
her
court
from
her
throne
of
mere
power
and
strong
charm
on
the
afternoons
when
people
ran
in
to
warm
themselves
by
her
fire
the
talk
was
never
dull
and
was
often
wonderful
there
were
those
who
came
quietly
into
the
room
fresh
from
important
scenes
where
subjects
of
weight
to
nations
were
being
argued
closely
perhaps
almost
fiercely
sometimes
the
argument
was
continued
over
cups
of
perfect
tea
near
the
chair
of
the
duchess
and
howsoever
far
it
led
she
was
able
brilliantly
to
follow
with
the
aid
of
books
and
pamphlets
and
magazines
and
the
strong
young
man
with
the
nice
voice
who
was
her
reader
she
kept
pace
with
each
step
of
the
march
of
the
world
it
was
however
the
modern
note
in
her
recollections
of
her
march
in
days
long
past
in
which
coombe
found
mental
food
and
fine
flavour
the
phrase
in
these
days
expressed
in
her
utterance
neither
disparagement
nor
regret
she
who
sat
in
state
in
a
lighted
by
wax
candles
did
so
as
an
affair
of
personal
preference
and
denied
no
claim
of
higher
brilliance
to
electric
illumination
driving
slowly
through
hyde
park
on
sunny
days
when
she
was
able
to
go
out
her
barouche
hinted
at
no
lofty
disdain
of
petrol
and
motor
power
at
the
close
of
her
youth
century
she
looked
forward
with
thrilled
curiosity
to
the
dawning
wonders
of
the
next
if
the
past
had
not
held
so
much
one
might
not
have
learned
to
expect
more
was
her
summing
up
on
a
certain
afternoon
when
he
came
to
report
himself
after
one
of
his
absences
from
england
the
most
important
discovery
of
the
last
fifty
years
has
been
the
revelation
that
no
man
may
any
longer
assume
to
speak
the
last
word
on
any
subject
the
next
man
almost
any
next
man
may
evolve
more
before
that
period
all
elderly
persons
were
final
in
their
dictum
they
said
to
each
other
and
particularly
to
the
young
has
not
been
done
in
my
time
it
was
not
done
in
my
time
it
has
never
been
done
it
never
can
be
done
the
note
of
today
is
it
has
never
been
done
it
will
surely
be
done
soon
said
coombe
ah
we
who
began
life
in
the
most
assured
and
respectable
of
reigns
and
centuries
she
answered
him
have
seen
much
but
these
others
will
see
more
crinolines
mushroom
hats
and
large
families
seemed
to
promise
a
decorum
peaceful
to
dullness
but
there
have
been
battles
murders
and
sudden
deaths
there
have
been
almost
supernatural
inventions
and
discoveries
there
have
been
marvels
of
new
doubts
and
faiths
when
one
sits
and
counts
upon
fingers
the
amazements
the
century
has
provided
one
gasps
and
gazes
with
wide
eyes
into
the
future
i
for
one
feel
rather
as
though
i
had
seen
a
calm
milch
cow
sauntering
at
first
slowly
along
a
path
gradually
evolve
into
a
tiger
a
genie
with
a
hundred
heads
containing
all
the
marvels
of
the
world
a
flying
dragon
with
a
thousand
eyes
oh
we
have
gone
fast
and
far
and
we
shall
go
faster
and
farther
coombe
added
that
is
it
she
answered
are
we
going
too
fast
at
least
so
fast
that
we
forget
things
it
would
be
well
for
us
to
remember
he
had
come
in
that
day
with
a
certain
preoccupied
grimness
of
expression
which
was
not
unknown
to
her
it
was
generally
after
one
of
his
absences
that
he
looked
a
shade
grim
such
as
she
inquired
such
as
catastrophes
in
the
history
of
the
world
which
forethought
and
wisdom
might
have
prevented
the
french
revolution
is
the
obvious
type
of
figure
which
lies
close
at
hand
so
one
picks
it
up
the
french
revolution
its
reign
of
terror
the
orgies
of
carnage
the
cataclysms
of
agony
need
not
have
been
but
they
were
to
put
it
in
words
of
one
syllable
what
was
her
involuntary
exclamation
you
are
seeking
such
similes
as
the
french
revolution
who
knows
how
far
a
madness
may
reach
and
what
reign
of
terror
may
take
form
he
sat
down
and
drew
an
atlas
towards
him
it
always
lay
upon
the
table
on
which
all
the
duchess
desired
was
within
reach
it
was
fat
convenient
of
form
and
agreeable
to
look
at
in
its
cover
of
dull
green
leather
coombe
gesture
of
drawing
it
towards
him
was
a
familiar
one
it
was
frequently
used
as
reference
the
atlas
again
she
said
yes
just
now
i
can
think
of
little
else
i
have
realized
too
much
the
continental
journey
had
lasted
a
month
he
had
visited
more
countries
than
one
in
his
pursuit
of
a
study
he
was
making
of
the
way
in
which
the
wind
was
blowing
particular
straws
for
long
he
had
found
much
to
give
thought
to
in
the
trend
of
movement
in
one
special
portion
of
the
chessboard
it
was
that
portion
of
it
dominated
by
the
ruler
of
whose
obsession
too
careless
nations
made
sly
jest
this
man
he
had
known
from
his
arrogant
and
unendearing
youth
he
had
looked
on
with
unbiassed
curiosity
at
his
development
into
arrogance
so
much
greater
than
its
proportions
touched
the
grotesque
the
rest
of
the
world
had
looked
on
also
but
apparently
merely
in
the
casual
way
which
smiles
and
leaves
to
every
man
even
an
emperor
the
privilege
of
his
own
eccentricities
coombe
had
looked
on
with
a
difference
so
also
had
his
friend
by
her
fireside
this
man
square
of
the
chessboard
had
long
been
the
subject
of
their
private
talks
and
a
cause
for
the
drawing
towards
them
of
the
green
atlas
the
moves
he
made
the
methods
of
his
ruling
the
significance
of
these
methods
were
the
evidence
they
collected
in
their
frequent
arguments
coombe
had
early
begun
to
see
the
whole
thing
as
a
process
a
labour
which
was
a
means
to
a
monstrous
end
there
was
a
certain
thing
he
believed
of
which
they
often
spoke
as
it
he
spoke
of
it
now
through
three
weeks
i
have
been
marking
how
it
grows
he
said
a
whole
nation
with
the
entire
power
of
its
commerce
its
education
its
science
its
religion
guided
towards
one
aim
is
a
curious
study
the
very
babes
are
born
and
bred
and
taught
only
that
one
thought
may
become
an
integral
part
of
their
being
the
most
innocent
and
blue
eyed
of
them
knows
without
a
shadow
of
doubt
that
the
world
has
but
one
reason
for
existence
that
it
may
be
conquered
and
ravaged
by
the
country
that
gave
them
birth
i
have
both
heard
and
seen
it
she
said
one
has
smiled
in
spite
of
oneself
in
listening
to
their
simple
everyday
talk
in
little
schools
in
large
ones
in
little
churches
and
in
imposing
ones
their
faith
is
taught
and
preached
coombe
answered
sometimes
one
can
not
believe
one
hearing
it
is
all
so
ingenuously
and
frankly
unashamed
the
mouthing
boasting
and
threats
of
their
piety
there
exists
for
them
no
god
who
is
not
the
modest
henchman
of
their
emperor
and
whose
attention
is
not
rivetted
on
their
prowess
with
admiration
and
awe
apparently
they
are
his
business
and
he
is
well
paid
by
being
allowed
to
retain
their
confidence
a
lack
of
any
sense
of
humour
is
a
disastrous
thing
commented
the
duchess
the
people
of
other
nations
may
be
fools
doubtless
we
all
are
but
there
is
no
other
which
proclaims
the
fact
abroad
with
such
guileless
outbursts
of
raucous
exultation
and
even
we
you
and
i
who
have
thought
more
than
others
he
said
restlessly
even
we
forget
and
half
smile
there
been
too
much
smiling
she
picked
up
an
illustrated
paper
and
opened
it
at
a
page
filled
by
an
ornate
picture
see
she
said
it
is
because
he
himself
has
made
it
so
easy
with
his
amazing
portraits
of
his
big
boots
and
swords
and
eruption
of
dangling
orders
how
can
one
help
but
smile
when
one
finds
him
glaring
at
one
from
a
newspaper
in
his
superwarlike
attitude
defying
the
universe
with
his
comic
moustachios
and
their
ferocious
waxed
and
bristling
ends
no
one
can
scarcely
believe
that
a
man
can
be
stupid
enough
not
to
realize
that
he
looks
as
if
he
had
deliberately
made
himself
up
to
represent
a
sort
of
terrific
military
bogey
intimating
that
at
he
may
pounce
and
say
there
lies
the
peril
his
pretensions
seem
too
grotesque
to
be
treated
seriously
and
while
he
should
be
watched
as
a
madman
is
watched
he
is
given
a
lifetime
to
we
attack
on
a
world
that
has
ceased
to
believe
in
the
sole
thing
which
is
real
to
himself
you
are
fresh
from
observation
there
was
new
alertness
in
her
eyes
though
she
had
listened
before
i
tell
you
it
grows
he
gave
back
and
lightly
struck
the
table
in
emphasis
do
you
remember
carlyle
the
french
revolution
again
yes
do
you
recall
this
not
fires
fevers
seeds
chemical
mixtures
go
on
growing
observe
too
that
each
grows
with
a
rapidity
proportioned
to
the
madness
and
unhealthiness
there
is
in
it
a
ruler
who
in
an
unaggressive
age
such
as
this
can
concentrate
his
life
and
his
people
on
the
one
ambition
of
plunging
the
world
in
an
ocean
of
blood
in
which
his
own
monomania
can
bathe
in
triumph
good
god
there
is
madness
and
unhealthiness
to
flourish
in
the
world
she
said
yes
it
will
be
the
world
see
he
said
with
a
curve
of
the
finger
which
included
most
of
the
map
of
europe
here
are
countries
engaged
like
the
bandarlog
in
their
own
affairs
quarrelling
snatching
things
from
each
other
blustering
or
amusing
themselves
with
transitory
pomps
and
displays
of
power
here
is
a
huge
empire
whose
immense
population
has
seethed
for
centuries
in
its
hidden
boiling
cauldron
of
rebellion
oh
it
has
seethed
and
only
cruelties
have
repressed
it
now
and
then
it
has
boiled
over
in
assassination
in
high
places
and
one
has
wondered
how
long
its
autocratic
splendour
could
hold
its
own
here
are
small
fierce
helpless
nations
overrun
and
outraged
into
a
chronic
state
of
secret
hatred
here
are
innocent
small
countries
defenceless
through
their
position
and
size
here
is
france
rich
careless
and
cynic
here
is
england
comfortable
to
stolidity
prosperous
and
secure
to
dullness
in
her
own
half
belief
in
a
world
civilization
which
no
longer
argues
in
terms
of
blood
and
steel
and
here
in
a
position
in
the
midst
of
it
all
within
but
a
few
hundreds
of
miles
of
weakness
complicity
disastrous
unreadiness
and
uncertainty
of
purpose
sits
this
man
of
one
dream
who
believes
god
himself
his
vassal
here
he
sits
yes
his
one
dream
he
has
had
no
other
the
duchess
was
poring
over
the
map
also
they
were
as
people
pondering
over
a
strange
and
terrible
game
it
is
his
monomania
it
possessed
him
when
he
was
a
boy
what
napoleon
hoped
to
accomplish
he
has
believed
he
could
attain
by
concentrating
all
the
power
of
people
upon
preparation
for
it
and
by
not
flinching
from
pouring
forth
their
blood
as
if
it
were
the
refuse
water
of
his
gutters
yes
the
blood
the
blood
the
duchess
shuddered
he
would
pour
it
forth
without
a
qualm
coombe
touched
the
map
first
at
one
point
and
then
at
another
see
he
said
again
and
this
time
savagely
this
empire
flattered
and
entangled
by
cunning
this
country
irritated
this
deceived
this
drawn
into
argument
this
and
this
and
this
treated
with
professed
friendship
these
tricked
and
juggled
with
and
then
when
his
plans
are
ripe
and
he
is
made
drunk
with
belief
in
himself
just
one
sodden
insult
or
monstrous
breach
of
faith
which
all
humanity
must
leap
to
resent
and
there
is
our
world
revolution
the
duchess
sat
upright
in
her
chair
why
did
you
let
your
youth
pass
she
said
if
you
had
begun
early
enough
you
could
hare
made
the
country
listen
to
you
why
did
you
do
it
for
the
same
reason
that
all
selfish
grief
and
pleasure
and
indifference
let
the
world
go
by
and
i
am
not
sure
they
would
have
listened
i
speak
freely
enough
now
in
some
quarters
they
listen
but
they
do
nothing
there
is
a
warning
in
the
fact
that
as
he
has
seen
his
youth
leave
him
without
giving
him
his
opportunity
he
has
been
a
disappointed
man
inflamed
and
made
desperate
at
the
outset
he
felt
that
he
must
provide
the
world
with
some
fiction
of
excuse
as
his
obsession
and
arrogance
have
swollen
he
sees
himself
and
his
ambition
as
reason
enough
no
excuse
is
needed
deutschland
uber
alles
is
sufficient
he
pushed
the
map
away
and
his
fire
died
down
he
spoke
almost
in
his
usual
manner
the
conquest
of
the
world
he
said
he
is
a
great
fool
what
would
he
do
with
his
continents
if
he
got
them
what
indeed
pondered
her
grace
continents
even
kingdoms
are
not
like
kittens
in
a
basket
or
puppies
to
be
trained
to
come
to
heel
it
is
part
of
his
monomania
that
he
can
persuade
himself
that
they
are
little
more
coombe
had
been
slowly
swaying
from
the
ribbon
in
his
fingers
he
let
them
continue
to
sway
a
moment
and
then
closed
them
with
a
snap
he
is
a
great
fool
he
said
but
we
oh
my
friend
and
by
i
mean
the
rest
of
the
map
of
europe
we
are
much
greater
fools
a
mad
dog
loose
among
us
and
we
sit
and
smile
and
this
was
in
the
days
before
the
house
with
the
front
had
put
forth
its
first
geraniums
and
lobelias
in
window
boxes
robin
was
not
born
chapter
xviii
in
the
added
suite
of
rooms
at
the
back
of
the
house
robin
grew
through
the
years
in
which
it
was
growing
also
on
the
occasion
when
her
mother
saw
her
she
realized
that
she
was
not
at
least
going
to
look
like
a
barmaid
at
no
period
of
her
least
refulgent
moment
did
she
verge
upon
this
type
dowie
took
care
of
her
and
mademoiselle
valle
educated
her
with
the
assistance
of
certain
masters
who
came
to
give
lessons
in
german
and
italian
why
only
german
and
italian
and
french
said
feather
why
not
latin
and
greek
as
well
if
she
is
to
be
so
accomplished
it
is
modern
languages
one
needs
at
this
period
they
ought
to
be
taught
in
the
board
schools
coombe
replied
they
are
not
accomplishments
but
workman
tools
nationalities
are
not
separated
as
they
once
were
to
be
familiar
with
the
language
of
one
friends
and
one
enemies
is
a
protective
measure
what
country
need
one
protect
oneself
against
when
all
the
kings
and
queens
are
either
married
to
each
other
daughters
or
cousins
or
take
tea
with
each
other
every
year
or
so
just
think
of
the
friendliness
of
germany
for
instance
i
do
said
coombe
very
often
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
i
choose
german
rather
than
latin
and
greek
julius
caesar
and
nero
are
no
longer
reasons
for
alarm
is
the
kaiser
with
his
seventeen
children
and
his
respectable
frau
giggled
feather
all
that
he
cares
about
is
that
women
shall
be
made
to
remember
that
they
are
born
for
nothing
but
to
cook
and
go
to
church
and
have
babies
one
does
wonder
at
the
clothes
they
wear
it
was
not
a
month
after
this
however
when
lord
coombe
again
warming
himself
at
his
old
friend
fire
gave
her
a
piece
of
information
the
german
teacher
herr
wiese
has
hastily
returned
to
his
own
country
he
said
she
lifted
her
eyebrows
inquiringly
he
found
himself
suspected
of
being
a
spy
was
his
answer
with
most
excellent
reason
some
sketches
of
fortifications
were
found
in
a
box
he
left
behind
him
in
his
haste
the
country
all
countries
are
sown
with
those
like
him
mild
spectacled
students
and
clerks
in
warehouses
and
manufactories
are
weighing
and
measuring
resources
governesses
are
making
notes
of
conversation
and
of
any
other
thing
which
may
be
useful
in
time
of
war
if
they
were
caught
at
what
are
now
their
simple
daily
occupations
they
would
be
placed
against
a
wall
and
shot
as
it
is
they
are
allowed
to
play
about
among
us
and
slip
away
when
some
fellow
worker
hint
suggests
it
is
time
german
young
men
are
much
given
to
spending
a
year
or
so
here
in
business
positions
the
duchess
wore
a
thoughtful
air
that
has
been
going
on
for
a
decade
or
so
one
recognizes
their
teuton
type
in
shops
and
in
the
streets
they
say
they
come
to
learn
the
language
and
commercial
methods
not
long
ago
a
pompous
person
who
is
the
owner
of
a
big
shop
pointed
out
to
me
three
of
them
among
his
salesmen
coombe
said
he
plumed
himself
on
his
astuteness
in
employing
them
said
they
worked
for
low
wages
and
cared
for
very
little
else
but
finding
out
how
things
were
done
in
england
it
was
only
business
knowledge
they
were
after
he
said
they
went
about
everywhere
into
factories
and
dock
yards
and
public
buildings
and
made
funny
little
notes
and
sketches
of
things
they
did
understand
so
that
they
could
explain
them
in
germany
in
his
fatuous
insular
way
it
pleased
him
to
regard
them
rather
as
a
species
of
aborigines
benefiting
by
english
civilization
the
english
ass
and
the
german
ass
are
touchingly
alike
the
shade
of
difference
is
that
the
english
ass
sublime
is
in
the
german
ass
the
english
ass
smirks
and
plumes
himself
the
german
ass
blusters
and
bullies
and
defies
do
you
think
of
engaging
another
german
master
for
the
little
girl
the
duchess
asked
the
question
casually
i
have
heard
of
a
quiet
young
woman
who
has
shown
herself
thorough
and
in
a
certain
family
for
three
years
perhaps
she
also
will
disappear
some
day
but
for
the
present
she
will
serve
the
purpose
as
he
had
not
put
into
words
to
others
any
explanation
of
the
story
of
the
small
smart
establishment
in
the
mayfair
street
so
he
had
put
into
words
no
explanation
to
her
that
she
was
aware
of
its
existence
he
knew
but
what
she
thought
of
it
or
imagined
he
himself
thought
of
it
he
had
not
at
any
period
inquired
whatsoever
her
point
of
view
might
be
he
knew
it
would
be
unbiassed
clear
minded
and
wholly
just
she
had
asked
no
question
and
made
no
comment
the
rapid
whirligig
existence
of
the
fashionable
groups
including
in
their
circles
varieties
of
the
type
were
to
be
seen
at
smart
functions
and
to
be
read
of
in
newspapers
and
fashion
reports
if
one
taste
lay
in
the
direction
of
a
desire
to
follow
their
movements
the
time
had
passed
when
pretty
women
of
her
kind
were
cut
off
by
severities
of
opinion
from
the
delights
of
a
world
they
had
thrown
their
dice
daringly
to
gain
the
worldly
old
axiom
be
virtuous
and
you
will
be
happy
had
been
ironically
paraphrased
too
often
please
yourself
and
you
will
be
much
happier
than
if
you
were
virtuous
was
a
practical
reading
but
for
a
certain
secret
which
she
alone
knew
and
which
no
one
would
in
the
least
have
believed
if
she
had
proclaimed
it
from
the
housetops
feather
would
really
have
been
entirely
happy
and
after
all
the
fly
in
her
ointment
was
merely
an
odd
sting
a
fantastic
fate
had
inflicted
on
her
vanity
and
did
not
in
any
degree
affect
her
pleasures
so
many
people
lived
in
glass
houses
that
the
habit
of
throwing
stones
had
fallen
out
of
fashion
as
an
exercise
there
were
those
too
whose
houses
of
glass
adroitly
given
the
air
of
being
respectable
conservatories
engendered
in
the
dwellers
therein
a
leniency
towards
other
vitreous
constructions
as
a
result
of
this
last
circumstance
there
were
times
when
quite
stately
equipages
drew
up
before
door
and
visiting
cards
bearing
the
names
of
acquaintances
much
to
be
desired
were
left
upon
the
salver
presented
by
jennings
again
as
a
result
of
this
circumstance
feather
employed
some
laudable
effort
in
her
desire
to
give
her
own
glass
house
the
conservatory
aspect
her
little
parties
became
less
noisy
if
they
still
remained
lively
she
gave
an
afternoon
now
and
then
to
which
literary
people
and
artists
and
persons
who
did
things
were
invited
she
was
pretty
enough
to
allure
an
occasional
musician
to
do
something
some
new
poet
to
read
or
recite
fashionable
people
were
asked
to
come
and
hear
and
talk
to
them
and
in
this
way
she
threw
out
delicate
fishing
lines
here
and
there
and
again
and
again
drew
up
a
desirable
fish
of
substantial
size
sometimes
the
vague
rumour
connected
with
the
name
of
the
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
was
quite
forgotten
and
she
was
referred
to
amiably
as
that
beautiful
creature
she
was
left
a
widow
when
she
was
nothing
but
a
girl
if
she
had
had
a
little
money
of
her
own
and
if
her
husband
relatives
had
taken
care
of
her
she
would
have
had
a
hard
time
of
it
she
is
amazingly
clever
at
managing
her
small
income
they
added
her
tiny
house
is
one
of
the
jolliest
little
places
in
london
always
full
of
good
looking
people
and
amusing
things
but
before
robin
was
fourteen
she
had
found
out
that
the
house
she
lived
in
was
built
of
glass
and
that
any
chance
stone
would
break
its
panes
even
if
cast
without
particular
skill
in
aiming
she
found
it
out
in
various
ways
but
the
seed
from
which
all
things
sprang
to
the
fruition
of
actual
knowledge
was
the
child
tragedy
through
which
she
had
learned
that
donal
had
been
taken
from
her
because
his
mother
would
not
let
him
love
and
play
with
a
little
girl
whose
mother
let
lord
coombe
come
to
her
house
because
lord
coombe
was
so
bad
that
even
servants
whispered
secrets
about
him
her
first
interpretation
of
this
had
been
that
of
a
mere
baby
but
it
had
filled
her
being
with
detestation
of
him
and
curious
doubts
of
her
mother
donal
mother
who
was
good
and
beautiful
would
not
let
him
come
to
see
her
and
kept
donal
away
from
him
if
the
lady
downstairs
was
good
too
then
why
did
laugh
and
talk
to
him
and
seem
to
like
him
she
had
thought
this
over
for
hours
sometimes
wakening
in
the
night
to
lie
and
puzzle
over
it
feverishly
then
as
time
went
by
she
had
begun
to
remember
that
she
had
never
played
with
any
of
the
children
in
the
square
gardens
it
had
seemed
as
though
this
had
been
because
andrews
would
not
let
her
but
if
she
was
not
fit
to
play
with
donal
perhaps
the
nurses
and
governesses
and
mothers
of
the
other
children
knew
about
it
and
would
not
trust
their
little
girls
and
boys
to
her
damaging
society
she
did
not
know
what
she
could
have
done
to
harm
them
and
oh
how
could
she
have
harmed
donal
but
there
must
be
something
dreadful
about
a
child
whose
mother
knew
bad
people
something
which
other
children
could
catch
like
scarlet
fever
from
this
seed
other
thoughts
had
grown
she
did
not
remain
a
baby
long
a
fervid
little
brain
worked
for
her
picked
up
hints
and
developed
suggestions
set
her
to
singularly
alert
reasoning
which
quickly
became
too
mature
for
her
age
the
quite
horrid
little
girl
who
flouncingly
announced
that
she
could
not
be
played
with
any
more
because
of
lord
coombe
set
a
spark
to
a
train
after
that
time
she
used
to
ask
occasional
carefully
considered
questions
of
dowson
and
mademoiselle
valle
which
puzzled
them
by
their
vagueness
the
two
women
were
mutually
troubled
by
a
moody
habit
she
developed
of
sitting
absorbed
in
her
own
thoughts
and
with
a
concentrated
little
frown
drawing
her
brows
together
they
did
not
know
that
she
was
silently
planning
a
subtle
cross
examination
of
them
both
whose
form
would
be
such
that
neither
of
them
could
suspect
it
of
being
anything
but
innocent
she
felt
that
she
was
growing
cunning
and
deceitful
but
she
did
not
care
very
much
she
possessed
a
clever
and
determined
though
very
young
brain
she
loved
both
dowson
and
mademoiselle
but
she
must
find
out
about
things
for
herself
and
she
was
not
going
to
harm
or
trouble
them
they
would
never
know
she
had
found
out
whatsoever
she
discovered
she
would
keep
to
herself
but
one
does
not
remain
a
baby
long
and
one
is
a
little
girl
only
a
few
years
and
even
during
the
few
years
one
is
growing
and
hearing
and
seeing
all
the
time
after
that
one
is
beginning
to
be
a
rather
big
girl
and
one
has
seen
books
and
newspapers
and
overheard
scraps
of
things
from
servants
if
one
is
brought
up
in
a
convent
and
allowed
to
read
nothing
but
literature
selected
by
nuns
a
degree
of
aloofness
from
knowledge
may
be
counted
upon
though
even
convent
schools
it
is
said
encounter
their
difficulties
in
perfect
discipline
robin
in
her
small
palace
was
well
taken
care
of
but
her
library
was
not
selected
by
nuns
it
was
chosen
with
thought
but
it
was
the
library
of
modern
youth
mademoiselle
valle
theories
of
a
girl
education
were
not
founded
on
a
belief
that
until
marriage
she
should
be
led
about
by
a
string
blindfolded
and
with
ears
stopped
with
wax
that
results
in
a
bleating
lamb
being
turned
out
of
its
fold
to
make
its
way
through
a
jungle
full
of
wild
creatures
and
pitfalls
it
has
never
heard
of
she
said
in
discussing
the
point
with
dowson
she
had
learned
that
lord
coombe
agreed
with
her
he
as
well
as
she
chose
the
books
and
his
taste
was
admirable
its
inclusion
of
an
unobtrusive
care
for
girlhood
did
not
preclude
the
exercise
of
the
intellect
an
early
developed
passion
for
reading
led
the
child
far
and
wide
fiction
history
poetry
biography
opened
up
vistas
to
a
naturally
quick
and
eager
mind
mademoiselle
found
her
a
clever
pupil
and
an
little
being
even
from
the
first
she
always
felt
however
that
in
the
depths
of
her
something
held
itself
hidden
something
she
did
not
speak
of
it
was
some
thought
which
perhaps
bewildered
her
but
which
something
prevented
her
making
clear
to
herself
by
the
asking
of
questions
mademoiselle
valle
finally
became
convinced
that
she
never
would
ask
the
questions
arrived
a
day
when
feather
swept
into
the
palace
with
some
visitors
they
were
two
fair
and
handsome
little
girls
of
thirteen
and
fourteen
whose
mother
having
taken
them
shopping
found
it
would
suit
her
extremely
well
to
drop
then
somewhere
for
an
hour
while
she
went
to
her
dressmaker
feather
was
quite
willing
that
they
should
be
left
with
robin
and
mademoiselle
until
their
own
governess
called
for
them
here
are
eileen
and
winifred
erwyn
robin
she
said
bringing
them
in
talk
to
them
and
show
them
your
books
and
things
until
the
governess
comes
dowson
give
them
some
cakes
and
tea
erwyn
was
one
of
the
most
treasured
of
feather
circle
her
little
girls
governess
was
a
young
frenchwoman
entirely
unlike
mademoiselle
valle
eileen
and
winifred
saw
life
from
their
schoolroom
windows
as
an
open
book
why
not
since
their
governess
and
their
mother
french
maid
conversed
freely
and
had
rather
penetrating
voices
even
when
they
were
under
the
impression
that
they
lowered
them
out
of
deference
to
blameless
youth
eileen
and
winifred
liked
to
remain
awake
to
listen
as
long
as
they
could
after
they
went
to
bed
they
themselves
had
large
curious
eyes
and
were
given
to
whispering
and
giggling
they
talked
a
good
deal
to
robin
and
assumed
fashionable
little
grown
up
airs
they
felt
themselves
mature
creatures
as
compared
to
her
since
she
was
not
yet
thirteen
they
were
so
familiar
with
personages
and
functions
that
robin
felt
that
they
must
have
committed
to
memory
every
morning
the
column
in
the
daily
telegraph
known
as
london
day
by
day
she
sometimes
read
it
herself
because
it
was
amusing
to
her
to
read
about
parties
and
weddings
and
engagements
but
it
did
not
seem
easy
to
remember
winifred
and
eileen
were
delighted
to
display
themselves
in
the
character
of
instructresses
they
entertained
robin
for
a
short
time
but
after
that
she
began
to
dislike
the
shared
giggles
which
so
often
broke
out
after
their
introduction
of
a
name
or
an
incident
it
seemed
to
hint
that
they
were
full
of
amusing
information
which
they
held
back
then
they
were
curious
and
made
remarks
and
asked
questions
she
began
to
think
them
rather
horrid
we
saw
lord
coombe
yesterday
said
winifred
at
last
and
the
unnecessary
giggle
followed
we
think
he
wears
the
most
beautiful
clothes
we
ever
saw
you
remember
his
overcoat
winnie
said
eileen
he
matches
so
and
yet
you
do
know
exactly
how
he
matches
and
she
giggled
also
he
is
the
best
dressed
man
in
london
winifred
stated
quite
grandly
i
think
he
is
handsome
so
do
mademoiselle
and
florine
robin
said
nothing
at
all
what
dowson
privately
called
her
secret
look
made
her
face
very
still
winifred
saw
the
look
and
not
understanding
it
or
her
became
curious
do
you
she
said
no
robin
answered
he
has
a
wicked
face
and
he
old
too
you
think
he
old
because
you
only
about
twelve
inserted
eileen
children
think
everybody
who
is
must
be
old
i
used
to
but
now
people
do
talk
and
think
about
age
as
they
used
to
mademoiselle
says
that
when
a
man
has
distinction
he
is
always
young
and
nicer
than
boys
winifred
who
was
persistent
broke
in
as
to
his
looking
wicked
i
daresay
he
is
wicked
in
a
sort
of
interesting
way
of
course
people
say
all
sorts
of
things
about
him
when
he
was
quite
young
he
was
in
love
with
a
beautiful
little
royal
princess
or
she
was
in
love
with
him
and
her
husband
either
killed
her
or
she
died
of
a
broken
heart
i
do
know
which
mademoiselle
valle
had
left
them
for
a
short
time
feeling
that
they
were
safe
with
their
tea
and
cakes
and
would
feel
more
at
ease
relieved
of
her
presence
she
was
not
long
absent
but
eileen
and
winifred
being
avid
of
gossip
and
generally
eliminated
subjects
got
in
their
work
with
quite
fevered
haste
they
liked
the
idea
of
astonishing
robin
eileen
bent
forward
and
lowered
her
voice
they
do
say
that
once
captain
thorpe
was
fearfully
jealous
of
him
and
people
wonder
that
he
was
among
the
the
word
filled
her
with
even
though
she
only
whispered
it
said
robin
they
both
began
to
whisper
at
once
quite
shrilly
in
their
haste
they
knew
mademoiselle
might
return
at
any
moment
the
great
divorce
case
you
know
the
thorpe
divorce
case
the
papers
are
so
full
of
we
get
the
under
housemaid
to
bring
it
to
us
after
mademoiselle
has
done
with
it
it
so
exciting
you
been
reading
it
oh
no
i
have
answered
robin
and
i
do
know
about
but
if
they
are
anything
horrid
i
daresay
he
was
one
of
them
and
at
that
instant
mademoiselle
returned
and
dowson
brought
in
fresh
cakes
the
governess
who
was
to
call
for
her
charges
presented
herself
not
long
afterwards
and
the
two
enterprising
little
persons
were
taken
away
i
believe
she
jealous
of
lord
coombe
eileen
whispered
to
winifred
after
they
reached
home
so
do
i
said
winifred
wisely
she
ca
help
but
know
how
he
adores
because
she
so
lovely
he
pays
for
all
her
pretty
clothes
it
silly
of
her
to
be
jealous
like
a
baby
robin
sometimes
read
newspapers
though
she
liked
books
better
newspapers
were
not
forbidden
her
she
been
reading
an
enthralling
book
and
had
not
seen
a
paper
for
some
days
she
at
once
searched
for
one
and
finding
it
sat
down
and
found
also
the
thorpe
divorce
case
it
was
not
difficult
of
discovery
as
it
filled
the
principal
pages
with
dramatic
evidence
and
amazing
revelations
dowson
saw
her
bending
over
the
spread
sheets
and
intense
in
her
concentration
what
are
you
reading
my
love
she
asked
the
little
flaming
face
lifted
itself
it
was
unhappy
obstinate
resenting
it
wore
no
accustomed
child
look
and
dowson
felt
rather
startled
i
reading
the
thorpe
divorce
case
dowie
she
answered
deliberately
and
distinctly
dowie
came
close
to
her
it
an
ugly
thing
to
read
my
lamb
she
faltered
do
you
read
it
such
things
ought
to
be
allowed
in
newspapers
and
you
a
little
girl
my
own
dear
robin
elbow
rested
firmly
on
the
table
and
her
chin
firmly
in
her
hand
her
eyes
were
not
like
a
bird
i
nearly
thirteen
she
said
i
growing
up
nobody
can
stop
themselves
when
they
begin
to
grow
up
it
makes
them
begin
to
find
out
things
i
want
to
ask
you
something
dowie
now
lovey
dowie
began
with
tremor
both
she
and
mademoiselle
had
been
watching
the
innocent
growing
up
and
fearing
a
time
would
come
when
the
widening
gaze
would
see
too
much
had
it
come
as
soon
as
this
robin
suddenly
caught
the
kind
woman
wrists
in
her
hands
and
held
them
while
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
her
the
childish
passion
of
dread
and
shyness
in
them
broke
dowson
heart
because
it
was
so
ignorant
and
young
i
growing
up
there
something
i
must
know
something
i
never
knew
how
to
ask
about
it
before
it
was
so
plain
to
dowson
that
she
did
not
know
how
to
ask
about
it
now
someone
said
that
lord
coombe
might
have
been
a
in
the
thorpe
case
these
wicked
children
gasped
dowie
they
not
children
at
all
everybody
horrid
but
you
and
mademoiselle
cried
robin
brokenly
she
held
the
wrists
harder
and
ended
in
a
sort
of
outburst
if
my
father
were
alive
could
he
bring
a
divorce
suit
and
would
lord
coombe
dowson
burst
into
open
tears
and
then
so
did
robin
she
dropped
dowson
wrists
and
threw
her
arms
around
her
waist
clinging
to
it
in
piteous
repentance
no
i
wo
she
cried
out
i
ought
to
try
to
make
you
tell
me
you
ca
i
wicked
to
you
poor
dowie
darling
dowie
i
want
to
kiss
you
dowie
let
me
let
me
she
sobbed
childishly
on
the
comfortable
breast
and
dowie
hugged
her
close
and
murmured
in
a
choked
voice
my
lamb
my
pet
lamb
chapter
xix
mademoiselle
valle
and
dowson
together
realized
that
after
this
the
growing
up
process
was
more
rapid
it
always
seems
incredibly
rapid
to
lookers
on
after
thirteen
but
these
two
watchers
felt
that
in
robin
case
it
seemed
unusually
so
robin
had
always
been
interested
in
her
studies
and
clever
at
them
but
suddenly
she
developed
a
new
concentration
and
it
was
of
an
order
which
her
governess
felt
denoted
the
secret
holding
of
some
object
in
view
she
devoted
herself
to
her
lessons
with
a
quality
of
determination
which
was
new
she
had
previously
been
absorbed
but
not
determined
she
made
amazing
strides
and
seemed
to
aspire
to
a
thoroughness
and
perfection
girls
did
not
commonly
aim
at
especially
at
the
frequently
rather
preoccupied
hour
of
blossoming
mademoiselle
encountered
in
her
an
eagerness
that
she
who
knew
girls
would
have
felt
it
optimistic
to
expect
in
most
cases
she
wanted
to
work
over
hours
she
would
have
read
too
much
if
she
had
not
been
watched
and
gently
coerced
she
was
not
distracted
by
the
society
of
young
people
of
her
own
age
she
indeed
showed
a
definite
desire
to
avoid
such
companionship
what
she
said
to
mademoiselle
valle
one
afternoon
during
a
long
walk
they
took
together
held
its
own
revelation
for
the
older
woman
they
had
come
upon
the
two
erwyns
walking
with
their
attendant
in
kensington
gardens
and
seeing
them
at
some
distance
robin
asked
her
companion
to
turn
into
another
walk
i
do
want
to
meet
them
she
said
hurriedly
i
do
think
i
like
girls
perhaps
it
horrid
of
me
but
i
do
i
do
like
those
two
a
few
minutes
later
after
they
had
walked
in
an
opposite
direction
she
said
thoughtfully
perhaps
the
kind
of
girls
i
should
like
to
know
would
not
like
to
know
me
from
the
earliest
days
of
her
knowledge
of
lord
coombe
mademoiselle
valle
had
seen
that
she
had
no
cause
to
fear
lack
of
comprehension
on
his
part
with
a
perfection
of
method
they
searched
each
intelligence
it
had
become
understood
that
on
such
occasions
as
there
was
anything
she
wished
to
communicate
or
inquire
concerning
benby
in
his
private
room
was
at
mademoiselle
service
and
there
his
lordship
could
also
be
met
personally
by
appointment
there
have
been
no
explanations
mademoiselle
valle
said
to
dowson
he
does
not
ask
to
know
why
i
turn
to
him
and
i
do
not
ask
to
know
why
he
cares
about
this
particular
child
it
is
taken
for
granted
that
is
his
affair
and
not
mine
i
am
paid
well
to
take
care
of
robin
and
he
knows
that
all
i
say
and
do
is
part
of
my
taking
care
of
her
after
the
visit
of
the
erwyn
children
she
had
a
brief
interview
with
coombe
in
which
she
made
for
him
a
clear
sketch
it
was
a
sketch
of
unpleasant
little
minds
avid
and
curious
on
somewhat
exotic
subjects
little
minds
awake
to
rather
common
claptrap
and
gossipy
pinchbeck
interests
yes
unpleasant
luckless
little
persons
i
quite
understand
they
never
appeared
before
they
will
not
appear
again
thank
you
mademoiselle
he
said
the
little
girls
did
not
appear
again
neither
did
any
others
of
their
type
and
the
fact
that
feather
knew
little
of
other
types
was
a
sufficient
reason
for
robin
growing
up
without
companions
of
her
own
age
she
a
lonely
child
after
all
mademoiselle
said
she
always
was
answered
dowie
but
she
fond
of
us
bless
her
heart
and
it
is
loneliness
like
it
was
before
we
came
she
is
not
unhappy
she
is
too
blooming
and
full
of
life
mademoiselle
reflected
we
adore
her
and
she
has
many
interests
it
is
only
that
she
does
not
know
the
companionship
most
young
people
enjoy
perhaps
as
she
has
never
known
it
she
does
not
miss
it
the
truth
was
that
if
the
absence
of
intercourse
with
youth
produced
its
subtle
effect
on
her
she
was
not
aware
of
any
lack
and
a
certain
uncompanioned
habit
of
mind
which
gave
her
much
time
for
dreams
and
thought
was
accepted
by
her
as
a
natural
condition
as
simply
as
her
babyhood
had
accepted
the
limitations
of
the
day
and
night
nurseries
she
was
not
a
creature
but
the
time
came
when
she
became
rather
disturbed
by
the
fact
that
people
looked
at
her
very
often
as
she
walked
in
the
streets
sometimes
they
turned
their
heads
to
look
after
her
occasionally
one
person
walking
with
another
would
say
something
quietly
to
his
or
her
companion
and
they
even
paused
a
moment
to
turn
quite
round
and
look
the
first
few
times
she
noticed
this
she
flushed
prettily
and
said
nothing
to
mademoiselle
valle
who
was
generally
with
her
but
after
her
attention
had
been
attracted
by
the
same
thing
on
several
different
days
she
said
uneasily
am
i
quite
tidy
mademoiselle
quite
mademoiselle
answered
just
a
shade
uneasy
herself
i
began
to
think
that
perhaps
something
had
come
undone
or
my
hat
was
crooked
she
explained
those
two
women
stared
so
then
two
men
in
a
hansom
leaned
forward
and
one
said
something
to
the
other
and
they
both
laughed
a
little
mademoiselle
hurriedly
now
there
are
three
young
men
quite
indignantly
do
let
them
see
you
notice
them
but
i
think
it
rude
they
were
carelessly
joyous
and
not
strictly
youths
who
were
taking
a
holiday
together
and
their
rudeness
was
quite
unintentional
and
without
guile
they
merely
stared
and
obviously
muttered
comments
to
each
other
as
they
passed
each
giving
the
hasty
unconscious
touch
to
his
young
moustache
which
is
the
automatic
sign
of
pleasurable
observation
in
the
human
male
if
she
had
had
companions
of
her
own
age
she
would
have
known
all
about
it
long
ago
mademoiselle
was
thinking
her
intelligent
view
of
such
circumstances
was
that
the
simple
fact
they
arose
from
could
with
perfect
taste
only
be
treated
simply
it
was
a
mere
fact
therefore
why
be
prudish
and
affected
about
it
they
did
not
intend
any
rudeness
she
said
after
they
had
gone
by
they
are
not
much
more
than
boys
and
not
perfectly
behaved
people
often
stare
when
they
see
a
very
pretty
girl
i
am
afraid
i
do
it
myself
you
are
very
pretty
quite
calmly
and
as
one
speaking
without
prejudice
robin
turned
and
looked
at
her
and
the
colour
which
was
like
a
jacqueminot
rose
flooded
her
face
she
was
at
the
flushing
age
her
gaze
was
interested
speculative
and
a
shade
startled
merely
a
shade
oh
she
said
briefly
not
in
exclamation
exactly
but
in
a
sort
of
acceptance
then
she
looked
straight
before
her
and
went
on
walking
with
the
lovely
slightly
swaying
buoyant
step
which
in
itself
drew
attracted
eyes
after
her
if
i
were
a
model
governess
such
as
one
read
of
long
before
you
were
born
mademoiselle
valle
continued
i
should
feel
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
beauty
counts
for
nothing
but
that
is
nonsense
it
counts
a
great
deal
with
some
women
it
counts
for
everything
such
women
are
not
lucky
one
should
thank
heaven
for
it
and
make
the
best
of
it
without
exaggerated
anxiety
both
dowie
and
i
who
love
you
are
grateful
to
le
bon
dieu
that
you
are
pretty
i
have
sometimes
thought
i
was
pretty
when
i
saw
myself
in
the
glass
said
robin
with
unexcited
interest
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
looked
pretty
but
at
the
same
time
i
could
help
knowing
that
everything
is
a
matter
of
taste
and
that
it
might
be
because
i
was
conceited
you
are
not
conceited
answered
the
frenchwoman
i
do
want
to
be
said
robin
i
want
to
be
a
serious
person
with
with
a
strong
character
mademoiselle
smile
was
touched
with
affectionate
doubt
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
to
view
this
lovely
thing
in
the
light
of
a
strong
character
though
after
all
what
exactly
was
strength
she
was
a
warm
intensely
loving
love
compelling
tender
being
having
seen
much
of
the
world
and
of
humanity
and
inhumanity
mademoiselle
valle
had
had
moments
of
being
afraid
for
her
particularly
when
by
chance
she
recalled
the
story
dowson
had
told
her
of
the
bits
of
crushed
and
broken
leaves
a
serious
person
she
said
and
strong
because
i
must
earn
my
own
living
said
robin
i
must
be
strong
enough
to
take
care
of
myself
i
am
going
to
be
a
governess
or
something
here
it
was
revealed
to
mademoiselle
as
in
a
flash
was
the
reason
why
she
had
applied
herself
with
determination
to
her
studies
this
had
been
the
object
in
view
for
reasons
of
her
own
she
intended
to
earn
her
living
with
touched
interest
mademoiselle
valle
waited
wondering
if
she
would
be
frank
about
the
reason
she
merely
said
aloud
a
governess
perhaps
there
may
be
something
else
i
can
do
i
might
be
a
secretary
or
something
like
that
girls
and
women
are
beginning
to
do
so
many
new
things
her
charge
explained
herself
i
do
not
want
to
be
supported
and
given
money
i
mean
i
do
not
want
other
people
to
buy
my
clothes
and
food
and
things
the
newspapers
are
full
of
advertisements
i
could
teach
children
i
could
translate
business
letters
very
soon
i
shall
be
old
enough
to
begin
girls
in
their
teens
do
it
she
had
laid
some
of
her
cards
on
the
table
but
not
all
poor
child
she
was
not
going
into
the
matter
of
her
really
impelling
reasons
but
mademoiselle
valle
was
not
dull
and
her
affection
added
keenness
to
her
mental
observations
also
she
had
naturally
heard
the
story
of
the
thorpe
lawsuit
from
dowson
inevitably
several
points
suggested
themselves
to
her
she
began
reasonably
but
robin
stopped
her
by
turning
her
face
full
upon
her
once
more
and
this
time
her
eyes
were
full
of
clear
significance
she
will
let
me
go
she
said
you
know
she
will
let
me
go
mademoiselle
darling
you
know
she
will
there
was
a
frank
comprehension
and
finality
in
the
words
which
made
a
full
revelation
of
facts
mademoiselle
herself
had
disliked
even
to
allow
to
form
themselves
into
thoughts
the
child
knew
all
sorts
of
things
and
felt
all
sorts
of
things
she
would
probably
never
go
into
details
but
she
was
extraordinarily
harrowingly
aware
she
had
been
learning
to
be
aware
for
years
this
had
been
the
secret
she
had
always
kept
to
herself
if
you
are
planning
this
mademoiselle
said
as
reasonably
as
before
we
must
work
very
seriously
for
the
next
few
years
how
long
do
you
think
it
will
take
asked
robin
she
was
nearing
sixteen
bursting
into
glowing
blossom
a
radiant
touching
thing
whom
one
only
could
visualize
in
flowering
gardens
in
charming
enclosing
rooms
figuratively
embraced
by
every
mature
and
kind
arm
within
reach
of
her
this
presented
itself
before
mademoiselle
valle
with
such
vividness
that
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
control
a
sigh
when
i
feel
that
you
are
ready
i
will
tell
you
she
answered
and
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
help
you
before
i
leave
you
oh
robin
gasped
in
an
involuntarily
childish
way
i
thought
of
that
how
could
i
live
without
you
and
dowie
i
know
you
had
not
thought
of
it
said
mademoiselle
affectionately
you
are
only
a
dear
child
yet
but
that
will
be
part
of
it
you
know
a
governess
or
a
secretary
or
a
young
lady
in
an
office
translating
letters
can
not
take
her
governess
and
maid
with
her
oh
said
robin
again
and
her
eyes
became
suddenly
so
dewy
that
the
person
who
passed
her
at
the
moment
thought
he
had
never
seen
such
wonderful
eyes
in
his
life
so
much
of
her
was
still
child
that
the
shock
of
this
sudden
practical
realization
thrust
the
mature
and
determined
part
of
her
being
momentarily
into
the
background
and
she
could
scarcely
bear
her
alarmed
pain
it
was
true
that
she
had
been
too
young
to
face
her
plan
as
she
must
but
after
the
long
walk
was
over
and
she
found
herself
in
her
bedroom
again
she
was
conscious
of
a
sense
of
being
relieved
of
a
burden
she
had
been
wondering
when
she
could
tell
mademoiselle
and
dowie
of
her
determination
she
had
not
liked
to
keep
it
a
secret
from
them
as
if
she
did
not
love
them
but
it
had
been
difficult
to
think
of
a
way
in
which
to
begin
without
seeming
as
if
she
thought
she
was
quite
grown
up
which
would
have
been
silly
she
had
not
thought
of
speaking
today
but
it
had
all
come
about
quite
naturally
as
a
result
of
mademoiselle
having
told
her
that
she
was
really
very
pretty
so
pretty
that
it
made
people
turn
to
look
at
her
in
the
street
she
had
heard
of
girls
and
women
who
were
like
that
but
she
had
never
thought
it
possible
that
she
she
had
of
course
been
looked
at
when
she
was
very
little
but
she
had
heard
andrews
say
that
people
looked
because
she
had
so
much
hair
and
it
was
like
curled
silk
she
went
to
the
dressing
table
and
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
leaning
forward
that
she
might
see
herself
closely
the
face
which
drew
nearer
and
nearer
had
the
effect
of
some
tropic
flower
because
it
was
so
alive
with
colour
which
seemed
to
palpitate
instead
of
standing
still
her
soft
mouth
was
warm
and
brilliant
with
it
and
the
darkness
of
her
eyes
was
as
it
had
always
been
like
dew
her
brow
were
a
slender
black
velvet
line
and
her
lashes
made
a
thick
softening
shadow
she
saw
they
were
becoming
she
cupped
her
round
chin
in
her
hands
and
studied
herself
with
a
desire
to
be
sure
of
the
truth
without
prejudice
or
self
conceit
the
whole
effect
of
her
was
glowing
and
she
felt
the
glow
as
others
did
she
put
up
a
finger
to
touch
the
velvet
petal
texture
of
her
skin
and
she
saw
how
prettily
pointed
and
slim
her
hand
was
yes
that
was
pretty
and
her
hair
the
way
it
grew
about
her
forehead
and
ears
and
the
back
of
her
neck
she
gazed
at
her
young
curve
and
colour
and
flame
of
life
first
beauty
with
deep
curiosity
singularly
impersonal
for
her
years
she
liked
it
she
began
to
be
grateful
as
mademoiselle
had
said
she
and
dowie
were
yes
if
other
people
liked
it
there
was
no
use
in
pretending
it
would
not
count
if
i
am
going
to
earn
my
living
she
thought
with
entire
gravity
it
may
be
good
for
me
if
i
am
a
governess
it
will
be
useful
because
children
like
pretty
people
and
if
i
am
a
secretary
and
work
in
an
office
i
daresay
men
like
one
to
be
pretty
because
it
is
more
cheerful
she
mentioned
this
to
mademoiselle
valle
who
was
very
kind
about
it
though
she
looked
thoughtful
afterwards
when
a
few
days
later
mademoiselle
had
an
interview
with
coombe
in
benby
comfortable
room
he
appeared
thoughtful
also
as
he
listened
to
her
recital
of
the
incidents
of
the
long
walk
during
which
her
charge
had
revealed
her
future
plans
she
is
a
nice
child
he
said
i
wish
she
did
not
dislike
me
so
much
i
understand
her
villain
as
she
thinks
me
i
am
not
a
genuine
villain
he
added
with
his
cold
smile
but
he
was
saying
it
to
himself
not
to
mademoiselle
this
she
saw
but
singularly
perhaps
she
spoke
as
if
in
reply
of
that
i
am
aware
he
turned
his
head
slightly
with
a
quick
unprepared
movement
yes
he
said
would
your
lordship
pardon
me
if
i
should
say
that
otherwise
i
should
not
ask
your
advice
concerning
a
very
young
girl
he
slightly
waved
his
hand
i
should
have
known
that
if
i
had
thought
of
it
i
do
know
it
mademoiselle
valle
bowed
the
fact
she
said
that
she
seriously
thinks
that
perhaps
beauty
may
be
an
advantage
to
a
young
person
who
applies
for
work
in
the
office
of
a
man
of
business
because
it
may
seem
bright
and
cheerful
to
him
when
he
is
tired
and
out
of
spirits
that
gives
one
furiously
to
think
yes
to
me
she
said
it
milord
with
the
eyes
of
a
little
dove
brooding
over
her
young
i
could
see
her
lifting
them
like
an
angel
to
some
elderly
vaurien
who
would
merely
think
her
a
born
cocotte
here
coombe
rigid
face
showed
thought
indeed
good
god
he
muttered
quite
to
himself
good
god
in
a
low
breathless
voice
villain
or
saint
he
knew
not
one
world
but
many
we
must
take
care
of
her
he
said
next
she
is
not
an
insubordinate
child
she
will
do
nothing
yet
i
have
told
her
she
is
not
yet
ready
mademoiselle
valle
answered
i
have
also
promised
to
tell
her
when
she
is
and
to
help
her
god
help
her
if
we
do
not
he
said
she
is
on
the
whole
as
ignorant
as
a
little
sheep
and
butchers
are
on
the
lookout
for
such
as
she
is
they
suit
them
even
better
than
the
little
things
whose
tendencies
are
perverse
from
birth
an
old
man
with
an
evil
character
may
be
able
to
watch
over
her
from
a
distance
mademoiselle
regarded
him
with
grave
eyes
which
took
in
his
tall
thin
erectness
of
figure
his
bearing
the
perfection
of
his
attire
with
its
unfailing
freshness
which
was
not
newness
do
you
call
yourself
an
old
man
milord
she
asked
i
am
not
decrepit
years
need
not
bring
that
was
his
answer
but
i
believe
i
became
an
old
man
before
i
was
thirty
i
have
grown
no
older
in
that
which
is
really
age
since
then
in
the
moment
silence
which
followed
his
glance
met
mademoiselle
valle
and
fixed
itself
i
am
not
old
enough
or
young
enough
to
be
enamoured
of
little
daughter
he
said
you
need
not
be
told
that
but
you
have
heard
that
there
are
those
who
amuse
themselves
by
choosing
to
believe
that
i
am
a
few
light
and
not
too
fools
she
admitted
without
flinching
no
man
can
do
worse
for
himself
than
to
explain
and
deny
he
responded
with
a
smile
at
once
hard
and
fine
let
them
continue
to
believe
it
chapter
xx
sixteen
passed
by
with
many
other
things
much
more
disturbing
and
important
to
the
world
than
a
girl
birthday
seventeen
was
gone
with
passing
events
more
complicated
still
and
increasingly
significant
but
even
the
owners
of
the
hands
hovering
over
the
chessboard
which
was
the
map
of
europe
did
not
keep
a
watch
on
all
of
them
as
close
as
might
have
been
kept
with
advantage
girls
in
their
teens
are
seldom
interested
in
political
and
diplomatic
conditions
and
robin
was
not
fond
of
newspapers
she
worked
well
and
steadily
under
mademoiselle
guidance
and
her
governess
realized
that
she
was
not
losing
sight
of
her
plans
for
self
support
she
was
made
aware
of
this
by
an
occasional
word
or
so
and
also
by
a
certain
telepathic
union
between
them
little
as
she
cared
for
the
papers
the
child
had
a
habit
of
closely
examining
the
advertisements
every
day
she
read
faithfully
the
columns
devoted
to
those
who
want
employment
or
are
wanted
by
employers
i
look
at
all
the
paragraphs
which
begin
a
young
or
a
woman
or
a
person
and
those
which
say
that
young
person
or
young
woman
or
young
lady
desires
a
position
i
want
to
find
out
what
is
oftenest
needed
she
had
ceased
to
be
disturbed
by
the
eyes
which
followed
her
or
opened
a
little
as
she
passed
she
knew
that
nothing
had
come
undone
or
was
crooked
and
that
untidiness
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
she
accepted
being
looked
at
as
a
part
of
everyday
life
a
certain
friendliness
and
pleasure
in
most
of
the
glances
she
liked
and
was
glad
of
sometimes
men
of
the
flushed
or
elderly
type
displeased
her
by
a
sort
of
boldness
of
manner
and
gaze
but
she
thought
that
they
were
only
silly
giddy
old
things
who
ought
to
go
home
to
their
families
and
stay
with
them
mademoiselle
or
dowie
was
nearly
always
with
her
but
as
she
was
not
a
french
jemme
fille
this
was
not
because
it
was
supposed
that
she
could
not
be
trusted
out
alone
but
because
she
enjoyed
their
affectionate
companionship
there
was
one
man
however
whom
she
greatly
disliked
as
young
girls
will
occasionally
dislike
a
member
of
the
opposite
sex
for
no
special
reason
they
can
wholly
explain
to
themselves
he
was
an
occasional
visitor
of
her
mother
a
personable
young
prussian
officer
of
high
rank
and
title
he
was
blonde
and
military
and
he
brought
his
bearing
and
manner
from
the
court
at
berlin
and
the
click
of
his
heels
as
he
brought
them
smartly
together
when
he
made
his
perfect
automatic
bow
was
one
of
the
things
robin
knew
she
was
reasonless
in
feeling
she
detested
in
him
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
he
was
not
merely
bowing
as
a
a
man
who
is
a
gentleman
does
she
confided
to
mademoiselle
valle
but
as
if
he
had
been
taught
to
do
it
and
to
call
attention
to
it
as
if
no
one
had
ever
known
how
to
do
it
properly
before
it
is
so
flourishing
in
its
stiff
way
that
it
rather
vulgar
that
is
only
personal
fancy
on
your
part
commented
mademoiselle
i
know
it
is
admitted
robin
but
uneasily
but
that
is
what
i
dislike
in
him
most
it
his
eyes
i
suppose
they
are
handsome
eyes
they
are
blue
and
full
rather
too
full
they
have
a
queer
swift
stare
as
if
they
plunged
into
other
eyes
and
tried
to
hold
them
and
say
something
secret
all
in
one
second
you
find
yourself
getting
red
and
trying
to
look
away
i
do
said
mademoiselle
astutely
because
she
wanted
to
hear
the
rest
without
asking
too
many
questions
robin
laughed
just
a
little
you
have
not
seen
him
do
it
i
have
not
seen
him
do
it
myself
very
often
he
comes
to
call
on
mamma
she
never
said
mother
when
he
is
in
london
he
has
been
coming
for
two
or
three
seasons
the
first
time
i
saw
him
i
was
going
out
with
dowie
and
he
was
just
going
upstairs
because
the
hall
is
so
small
we
almost
knocked
against
each
other
and
he
jumped
back
and
made
his
bow
and
he
stared
so
that
i
felt
silly
and
half
frightened
i
was
only
fifteen
then
and
since
then
mademoiselle
valle
inquired
when
he
is
here
it
seems
as
if
i
always
meet
him
somewhere
twice
when
fraulein
hirsch
was
with
me
in
the
square
gardens
he
came
and
spoke
to
us
i
think
he
must
know
her
he
was
very
grand
and
condescendingly
polite
to
her
as
if
he
did
not
forget
she
was
only
a
german
teacher
and
i
was
only
a
little
girl
whose
mamma
he
knew
but
he
kept
looking
at
me
until
i
began
to
hate
him
you
must
not
dislike
people
without
reason
you
dislike
lord
coombe
they
both
make
me
creep
lord
coombe
does
plunge
his
eyes
into
mine
but
he
makes
me
creep
with
his
fishy
coldness
i
feel
as
if
he
were
like
satan
in
his
still
way
that
is
childish
prejudice
and
nonsense
perhaps
the
other
is
too
said
robin
but
they
both
make
me
creep
nevertheless
i
would
rather
die
than
be
obliged
to
let
one
of
them
touch
me
that
was
why
i
would
never
shake
hands
with
lord
coombe
when
i
was
a
little
child
you
think
fraulein
hirsch
knows
the
baron
mademoiselle
inquired
further
i
am
sure
she
does
several
times
when
she
has
gone
out
to
walk
with
me
we
have
met
him
sometimes
he
only
passes
us
and
salutes
but
sometimes
he
stops
and
says
a
few
words
in
a
stiff
magnificent
way
but
he
always
bores
his
eyes
into
mine
as
if
he
were
finding
out
things
about
me
which
i
do
know
myself
he
has
passed
several
times
when
you
have
been
with
me
but
you
may
not
remember
mademoiselle
valle
chanced
however
to
recall
having
observed
the
salute
of
a
somewhat
haughty
masculine
person
whose
military
bearing
in
itself
was
sufficient
to
attract
attention
so
markedly
did
it
suggest
the
clanking
of
spurs
and
accoutrements
and
the
high
lift
of
a
breast
bearing
orders
he
is
count
von
hillern
and
i
wish
he
would
stay
in
germany
said
robin
fraulein
hirsch
had
not
been
one
of
those
who
returned
hastily
to
her
own
country
giving
no
warning
of
her
intention
to
her
employers
she
had
remained
in
london
and
given
her
lessons
faithfully
she
was
a
plain
young
woman
with
a
large
nose
and
pimpled
colourless
face
and
shy
eyes
and
manner
robin
had
felt
sure
that
she
stood
in
awe
of
the
rank
and
military
grandeur
of
her
fellow
countryman
she
looked
shyer
than
ever
when
he
condescended
to
halt
and
address
her
and
her
charge
so
shy
indeed
that
her
glances
seemed
furtive
robin
guessed
that
she
admired
him
but
was
too
humble
to
be
at
ease
when
he
was
near
her
more
than
once
she
had
started
and
turned
red
and
pale
when
she
saw
him
approaching
which
had
caused
robin
to
wonder
if
she
herself
would
feel
as
timid
and
overpowered
by
her
superiors
if
she
became
a
governess
clearly
a
man
like
count
von
hillern
would
then
be
counted
among
her
superiors
and
she
must
conduct
herself
becomingly
even
if
it
led
to
her
looking
almost
stealthy
she
had
on
several
occasions
asked
fraulein
certain
questions
about
governesses
she
had
inquired
as
to
the
age
at
which
one
could
apply
for
a
place
as
instructress
to
children
or
young
girls
fraulein
hirsch
had
begun
her
career
in
germany
at
the
age
of
eighteen
she
had
lived
a
serious
life
full
of
responsibilities
at
home
as
one
of
a
large
family
and
she
had
perhaps
been
rather
mature
for
her
age
in
england
young
women
who
wished
for
situations
answered
advertisements
and
went
to
see
the
people
who
had
inserted
them
in
the
newspapers
she
explained
sometimes
the
results
were
very
satisfactory
fraulein
hirsch
was
very
amiable
in
her
readiness
to
supply
information
robin
did
not
tell
her
of
her
intention
to
find
work
of
some
sort
probably
governessing
but
the
young
german
woman
was
possessed
of
a
mind
made
in
germany
and
was
quite
well
aware
of
innumerable
things
her
charge
did
not
suspect
her
of
knowing
one
of
the
things
she
knew
best
was
that
the
girl
was
a
child
she
was
not
a
child
herself
and
she
was
an
abjectly
bitter
and
wretched
creature
who
had
no
reason
for
hope
she
lived
in
small
lodgings
in
a
street
off
abbey
road
and
in
a
drawer
in
her
dressing
table
she
kept
hidden
a
photograph
of
a
prussian
officer
with
cropped
blond
head
and
handsome
prominent
blue
eyes
arrogantly
gazing
from
beneath
heavy
lids
which
drooped
he
was
of
the
type
the
german
woman
young
and
slim
or
mature
and
stout
privately
worships
as
a
god
whose
relation
to
any
woman
can
only
be
that
of
a
modern
jove
stooping
to
command
service
in
his
teens
he
had
become
accustomed
to
the
female
eye
which
lifts
itself
adoringly
or
casts
the
furtively
excited
glance
of
admiration
or
appeal
it
was
the
way
of
mere
nature
that
it
should
be
so
the
wise
provision
of
a
masculine
god
whose
world
was
created
for
the
supply
and
pleasure
of
males
especially
males
of
the
prussian
army
whose
fixed
intention
it
was
to
dominate
the
world
and
teach
it
obedience
to
such
a
man
so
thoroughly
well
trained
in
the
comprehension
of
the
power
of
his
own
rank
and
values
a
young
woman
such
as
fraulein
hirsch
subservient
and
without
beauty
was
an
unconsidered
object
to
be
as
little
regarded
as
the
pavement
upon
which
one
walks
the
pavement
had
its
uses
and
such
women
had
theirs
they
could
at
least
obey
the
orders
of
those
heaven
had
placed
above
them
and
if
they
showed
docility
and
intelligence
might
be
re
warded
by
a
certain
degree
of
approval
a
presumption
which
would
have
dared
to
acknowledge
to
the
existence
of
the
hidden
photograph
could
not
have
been
encompassed
by
the
being
of
fraulein
hirsch
she
was
in
truth
secretly
enslaved
by
a
burning
secret
passion
which
sometimes
as
she
lay
on
her
hard
bed
at
night
forced
from
her
thin
chest
hopeless
sobs
which
she
smothered
under
the
bedclothes
figuratively
she
would
have
licked
the
boots
of
her
conquering
god
if
he
would
have
looked
at
her
just
if
she
were
human
but
such
a
thing
could
not
have
occurred
to
him
he
did
not
even
think
of
her
as
she
thought
of
herself
torturingly
as
not
young
not
in
any
degree
not
geboren
not
even
female
he
did
not
think
of
her
at
all
except
as
one
of
those
born
to
serve
in
such
manner
as
their
superiors
commanded
she
was
in
england
under
orders
because
she
was
unobtrusive
looking
enough
to
be
a
safe
person
to
carry
on
the
work
she
had
been
given
to
do
she
was
cleverer
than
she
looked
and
could
accomplish
certain
things
without
attracting
any
attention
whatsoever
von
hillern
had
given
her
instructions
now
and
then
which
had
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
see
and
talk
to
her
in
various
places
the
fact
that
she
had
before
her
the
remote
chance
of
seeing
him
by
some
chance
gave
her
an
object
in
life
it
was
enough
to
be
allowed
to
stand
or
sit
for
a
short
time
near
enough
to
have
been
able
to
touch
his
sleeve
if
she
had
had
the
mad
audacity
to
do
it
to
quail
before
his
magnificent
glance
to
hear
his
voice
to
almost
touch
his
strong
white
hand
when
she
gave
him
papers
to
see
that
he
deigned
sometimes
to
approve
of
what
she
had
done
to
assure
him
of
her
continued
obedience
with
servile
politeness
she
was
not
a
nice
woman
or
a
good
one
and
she
had
from
her
birth
accepted
her
place
in
her
world
with
such
finality
that
her
desires
could
not
at
any
time
have
been
of
an
elevated
nature
if
he
had
raised
a
haughty
hand
and
beckoned
to
her
she
would
have
followed
him
like
a
dog
under
any
conditions
he
chose
to
impose
but
he
did
not
raise
his
hand
and
never
would
because
she
had
no
attractions
whatsoever
and
this
she
knew
so
smothered
her
sobs
in
her
bed
at
night
or
lay
awake
fevered
with
anticipation
when
there
was
a
vague
chance
that
he
might
need
her
for
some
reason
and
command
her
presence
in
some
deserted
park
or
country
road
or
cheap
hotel
where
she
could
take
rooms
for
the
night
as
if
she
were
a
passing
visitor
to
london
one
night
she
had
taken
cheap
lodgings
for
a
week
in
a
side
street
in
obedience
to
orders
he
came
in
about
nine
dressed
in
a
manner
whose
object
was
to
dull
the
effect
of
his
grandeur
and
cause
him
to
look
as
much
like
an
ordinary
englishman
as
possible
but
when
the
door
was
closed
and
he
stood
alone
in
the
room
with
her
she
saw
with
the
blissful
pangs
of
an
abjectly
adoring
woman
that
he
automatically
resumed
his
magnificence
of
bearing
his
badly
fitting
overcoat
removed
he
stood
erect
and
drawn
to
his
full
height
so
dominating
the
small
place
and
her
idolatrously
cringing
being
that
her
heart
quaked
within
her
oh
to
dare
to
cast
her
unloveliness
at
his
feet
if
it
were
only
to
be
trampled
upon
and
die
there
no
small
sense
of
humour
existed
in
her
brain
to
save
her
from
her
pathetic
idiocy
romantic
humility
and
touching
sacrifice
to
the
worshipped
one
were
the
ideals
she
had
read
of
in
verse
and
song
all
her
life
only
through
such
servitude
and
sacrifice
could
woman
gain
man
love
and
even
then
only
if
she
had
beauty
and
the
gifts
worthy
of
her
idol
acceptance
it
was
really
his
unmitigated
arrogance
she
worshipped
and
crawled
upon
her
poor
knees
to
adore
her
education
her
very
religion
itself
had
taught
that
it
was
the
sign
of
his
nobility
and
martial
high
breeding
even
the
women
of
his
own
class
believed
something
of
the
same
sort
the
more
romantic
and
sentimental
of
them
rather
enjoying
being
mastered
by
it
to
fraulein
mental
vision
he
was
a
sublimated
and
more
dazzling
german
rochester
and
she
herself
a
more
worthy
because
more
submissive
jane
eyre
ach
gott
his
cropped
head
his
so
beautiful
white
hands
his
proud
eyes
which
deigned
to
look
at
her
from
their
drooping
lids
his
presence
filled
the
shabby
room
with
the
atmosphere
of
a
palace
he
asked
her
a
few
questions
he
required
from
her
certain
notes
she
had
made
without
wasting
a
word
or
glance
he
gave
her
in
detail
certain
further
orders
he
stood
by
the
table
and
it
was
therefore
necessary
that
she
should
approach
him
should
even
stand
quite
near
that
she
might
see
clearly
a
sketch
he
made
hastily
immediately
afterwards
tearing
it
into
fragments
and
burning
it
with
a
match
she
was
obliged
to
stand
so
near
him
that
her
skirt
brushed
his
trouser
leg
his
nearness
and
a
vague
scent
of
cigar
smoke
mingled
with
the
suggestion
of
some
masculine
soap
or
essence
were
so
poignant
in
their
effect
that
she
trembled
and
water
rose
in
her
eyes
in
fact
and
despite
her
terrified
effort
to
control
it
a
miserable
tear
fell
on
her
cheek
and
stood
there
because
she
dared
not
wipe
it
away
because
he
realized
with
annoyance
that
she
was
trembling
he
cast
a
cold
inquiring
glance
at
her
and
saw
the
tear
then
he
turned
away
and
resumed
his
examination
of
her
notes
he
was
not
here
to
make
inquiries
as
to
whether
a
sheep
of
a
woman
was
crying
or
had
merely
a
cold
in
her
head
ach
grovelled
poor
hirsch
in
her
secret
soul
his
patrician
control
of
outward
expression
and
his
indifference
to
all
small
and
paltry
things
it
was
part
not
only
of
his
aristocratic
breeding
but
of
the
splendour
of
his
military
training
it
was
his
usual
custom
to
leave
her
at
once
when
the
necessary
formula
had
been
gone
through
tonight
she
scarcely
dared
to
believe
it
he
seemed
to
have
some
reason
for
slight
delay
he
did
not
sit
down
or
ask
fraulein
hirsch
to
do
so
but
he
did
not
at
once
leave
the
room
he
lighted
a
quite
marvellous
cigar
deigning
a
slight
wave
of
the
admired
hand
which
held
it
designating
that
he
asked
permission
oh
if
she
dared
have
darted
to
him
with
a
match
he
stood
upon
the
hearth
and
asked
a
question
or
so
regarding
her
employer
her
household
her
acquaintances
her
habits
the
sole
link
between
them
was
the
asking
of
questions
and
the
giving
of
private
information
and
therefore
the
matter
of
taste
in
such
matters
did
not
count
as
a
factor
he
might
ask
anything
and
she
must
answer
perhaps
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
seek
some
special
knowledge
among
the
guests
received
but
training
having
developed
in
her
alertness
of
mind
led
her
presently
to
see
that
it
was
not
he
was
chiefly
interested
in
but
a
member
of
her
family
the
very
small
family
which
consisted
of
herself
and
her
daughter
it
was
robin
he
was
enclosing
in
his
network
of
questions
and
she
had
seen
him
look
at
robin
when
he
had
passed
or
spoken
to
them
an
illuminating
flash
brought
back
to
her
that
he
had
cleverly
found
out
from
her
when
they
were
to
walk
together
and
where
they
were
to
go
she
had
not
been
quick
enough
to
detect
this
before
but
she
saw
it
now
girls
who
looked
like
that
yes
but
it
could
not
be
serious
an
english
girl
of
such
family
with
such
a
mother
a
momentary
caprice
such
as
all
young
men
of
his
class
amused
themselves
with
and
forgot
but
nothing
permanent
it
would
not
indeed
be
approved
in
those
high
places
where
obedience
was
the
first
commandment
of
the
decalogue
but
he
did
not
go
he
even
descended
a
shade
from
his
inaccessible
plane
it
was
not
difficult
for
him
to
obtain
details
of
the
odd
loneliness
of
the
girl
position
fraulein
hirsch
was
quite
ready
to
explain
that
in
spite
of
the
easy
morals
and
leniency
of
rank
and
fashion
in
england
she
was
a
sort
of
little
outcast
from
sacred
inner
circles
there
were
points
she
burned
to
make
clear
to
him
and
she
made
them
so
she
was
in
secret
fiercely
desirous
that
he
should
realize
to
the
utmost
that
whatsoever
rashness
this
young
flame
of
loveliness
inspired
in
him
it
was
not
possible
that
he
could
regard
it
with
any
shadow
of
serious
intention
she
had
always
disliked
the
girl
and
now
her
weak
mildness
and
humility
suddenly
transformed
themselves
into
something
else
a
sort
of
maternal
wolfishness
it
did
not
matter
what
happened
to
the
girl
and
whatsoever
befell
or
did
not
befall
her
she
mathilde
hirsch
could
neither
gain
nor
lose
hope
through
it
but
if
she
did
not
displease
him
and
yet
saved
him
from
final
disaster
he
would
perhaps
be
grateful
to
her
and
perhaps
speak
with
approval
or
remember
it
and
his
noble
mother
most
certainly
would
if
she
ever
knew
but
behind
and
under
and
through
all
these
specious
reasonings
was
the
hot
choking
burn
of
the
mad
jealousy
only
her
type
of
luckless
woman
can
know
and
of
whose
colour
she
dare
not
show
the
palest
hint
i
have
found
out
that
for
some
reason
she
thinks
of
taking
a
place
as
governess
she
said
suggest
that
she
go
to
berlin
there
are
good
places
there
was
his
answer
if
she
should
go
her
mother
will
not
feel
any
anxiety
about
her
returned
fraulein
hirsch
if
then
some
young
man
she
meets
in
the
street
makes
love
to
her
and
they
run
away
together
she
will
not
be
pursued
by
her
relatives
fraulein
hirsch
flat
mouth
looked
rather
malicious
her
mother
is
too
busy
to
pursue
her
and
there
is
no
one
else
unless
it
were
lord
coombe
who
is
said
to
want
her
himself
von
hillern
shrugged
his
fine
shoulders
at
his
age
after
the
mother
that
is
like
an
englishman
upon
this
fraulein
hirsch
drew
a
step
nearer
and
fixed
her
eyes
upon
his
as
she
had
never
had
the
joy
of
fixing
them
before
in
her
life
she
dared
it
now
because
she
had
an
interesting
story
to
tell
him
which
he
would
like
to
hear
it
was
like
an
englishman
lord
coombe
had
the
character
of
being
one
of
the
worst
among
them
but
was
too
subtle
and
clever
to
openly
offend
people
it
was
actually
said
that
he
was
educating
the
girl
and
keeping
her
in
seclusion
and
that
it
was
probably
his
colossal
intention
to
marry
her
when
she
was
old
enough
he
had
no
heir
of
his
own
and
he
must
have
beauty
and
innocence
innocence
and
beauty
his
viciousness
would
have
pah
exclaimed
von
hillern
it
is
youth
which
requires
such
things
and
takes
them
that
is
all
imbecile
london
gossip
no
he
would
not
run
after
her
if
she
ran
away
he
is
a
proud
man
and
he
knows
he
would
be
laughed
at
and
he
could
not
get
her
back
from
a
young
man
who
was
her
lover
her
lover
how
it
thrilled
the
burning
heart
her
poor
flat
chest
panted
above
with
what
triumphant
knowledge
of
such
things
he
said
it
no
he
could
not
she
answered
her
eyes
still
on
his
no
one
could
he
laughed
a
little
confidently
but
almost
with
light
indifference
if
she
were
missing
no
particular
search
would
be
made
then
he
said
she
is
pretty
enough
to
suit
berlin
he
seemed
to
think
pleasantly
of
something
as
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
his
eyes
on
the
floor
when
he
lifted
them
there
was
in
their
blue
a
hint
of
ugly
exulting
though
mathilde
hirsch
did
not
think
it
ugly
he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
it
will
be
an
exciting
a
colossal
day
when
we
come
to
london
as
we
shall
it
will
be
as
if
an
ocean
had
collected
itself
into
one
huge
mountain
of
a
wave
and
swept
in
and
overwhelmed
everything
there
will
be
confusion
then
and
the
rushing
up
of
untrained
soldiers
and
shouts
and
yells
and
zeppelins
dropping
bombs
she
so
far
forgot
herself
as
to
pant
out
and
buildings
crashing
and
pavements
and
people
smashed
westminster
and
the
palaces
rocking
and
fat
fools
running
before
bayonets
he
interrupted
her
with
a
short
laugh
uglier
than
the
gleam
in
his
eyes
he
was
a
trifle
excited
and
all
the
women
running
about
screaming
and
trying
to
hide
and
being
pulled
out
we
can
take
any
of
their
pretty
little
high
nosed
women
we
choose
any
of
them
yes
she
answered
biting
her
lip
no
one
would
take
her
she
knew
he
put
on
his
overcoat
and
prepared
to
leave
her
as
he
stood
at
the
door
before
opening
it
he
spoke
in
his
usual
tone
of
mere
command
take
her
to
kensington
gardens
tomorrow
afternoon
he
said
sit
in
one
of
the
seats
near
the
round
pond
and
watch
the
children
sailing
their
boats
i
shall
not
be
there
but
you
will
find
yourself
near
a
quiet
elegant
woman
in
mourning
who
will
speak
to
you
you
are
to
appear
to
recognize
her
as
an
old
acquaintance
follow
her
suggestions
in
everything
after
this
he
was
gone
and
she
sat
down
to
think
it
over
chapter
xxi
she
saw
him
again
during
the
following
week
and
was
obliged
to
tell
him
that
she
had
not
been
able
to
take
her
charge
to
kensington
gardens
on
the
morning
that
he
had
appointed
but
that
as
the
girl
was
fond
of
the
place
and
took
pleasure
in
watching
the
children
sailing
their
boats
on
the
round
pond
it
would
be
easy
to
lead
her
there
he
showed
her
a
photograph
of
the
woman
she
would
find
sitting
on
a
particular
bench
and
he
required
she
should
look
at
it
long
enough
to
commit
the
face
to
memory
it
was
that
of
a
quietly
elegant
woman
with
gentle
eyes
she
will
call
herself
lady
etynge
he
said
you
are
to
remember
that
you
once
taught
her
little
girl
in
paris
there
must
be
no
haste
and
no
mistakes
it
be
well
for
them
to
meet
by
accident
several
times
later
he
aid
to
her
when
lady
etynge
invites
her
to
go
to
her
house
you
will
of
course
go
with
her
you
will
not
stay
lady
etynge
will
tell
you
what
to
do
in
words
he
did
not
involve
himself
by
giving
any
hint
of
his
intentions
so
far
as
expression
went
he
might
have
had
none
whatever
her
secret
conclusion
was
that
he
knew
if
he
could
see
the
girl
under
propitious
circumstances
at
the
house
of
a
clever
and
sympathetic
acquaintance
he
need
have
no
shadow
of
a
doubt
as
to
the
result
of
his
efforts
to
please
her
he
knew
she
was
a
lonely
romantic
creature
who
had
doubtless
read
sentimental
books
and
been
allured
by
their
heroes
she
was
of
course
just
ripe
for
young
peerings
into
the
land
of
love
making
his
had
been
no
peerings
thought
the
pale
hirsch
sadly
what
girl
or
woman
could
resist
the
alluring
demand
of
his
drooping
eyes
if
he
chose
to
allow
warmth
to
fill
them
thinking
of
it
she
almost
gnashed
her
teeth
did
she
not
see
how
he
would
look
bending
his
high
head
and
murmuring
to
a
woman
who
shook
with
joy
under
his
gaze
had
she
not
seen
it
in
her
own
forlorn
hopeless
dreams
what
did
it
matter
if
what
the
world
calls
disaster
befell
the
girl
fraulein
hirsch
would
not
have
called
it
disaster
any
woman
would
have
been
paid
a
thousand
times
over
his
fancy
might
last
a
few
months
perhaps
he
would
take
her
to
berlin
or
to
some
lovely
secret
spot
in
the
mountains
where
he
could
visit
her
what
heaven
what
heaven
she
wept
hiding
her
face
on
her
hot
dry
hands
but
it
would
not
last
long
and
he
would
again
think
only
of
the
immense
work
the
august
machine
of
which
he
was
a
mechanical
part
and
he
would
be
obliged
to
see
and
talk
to
her
mathilde
hirsch
having
forgotten
the
rest
she
could
only
hold
herself
decently
in
check
by
telling
herself
again
and
again
that
it
was
only
natural
that
such
things
should
come
and
go
in
his
magnificent
life
and
that
the
sooner
it
began
the
sooner
it
would
end
it
was
a
lovely
morning
when
her
pupil
walked
with
her
in
kensington
gardens
and
quite
naturally
strolled
towards
the
round
pond
robin
was
happy
because
there
were
flutings
of
birds
in
the
air
gardeners
were
stuffing
crocuses
and
hyacinths
into
the
flower
beds
there
were
little
sweet
scents
floating
about
and
so
it
was
spring
she
pulled
a
bare
looking
branch
of
a
lilac
bush
towards
her
and
stooped
and
kissed
the
tiny
brown
buttons
upon
it
half
shyly
i
ca
help
it
when
i
see
the
first
ones
swelling
on
the
twigs
they
are
working
so
hard
to
break
out
into
green
she
said
one
loves
everything
at
this
time
everything
look
at
the
children
round
the
pond
that
fat
little
boy
in
a
reefer
and
brown
leather
leggings
is
bursting
with
joy
let
us
go
and
praise
his
boat
fraulein
they
went
and
robin
praised
the
boat
until
its
owner
was
breathless
with
rapture
fraulein
hirsch
standing
near
her
looked
furtively
at
all
the
benches
round
the
circle
giving
no
incautiously
interested
glance
to
any
one
of
them
in
particular
presently
however
she
said
i
think
that
is
lady
etynge
sitting
on
the
third
bench
from
here
i
said
to
you
that
i
had
heard
she
was
in
london
i
wonder
if
her
daughter
is
still
in
the
convent
at
tours
when
robin
returned
she
saw
a
quiet
woman
in
perfect
mourning
recognize
fraulein
hirsch
with
a
a
bow
and
smile
which
seemed
to
require
nearer
approach
we
must
go
and
speak
to
her
fraulein
hirsch
said
i
know
she
wil
wish
me
to
present
you
she
is
fond
of
young
girls
because
of
helene
robin
went
forward
prettily
the
woman
was
gentle
looking
and
attracting
she
had
a
sweet
manner
and
was
very
kind
to
fraulein
hirsch
she
seemed
to
know
her
well
and
to
like
her
her
daughter
helene
was
still
in
the
convent
at
tours
but
was
expected
home
very
shortly
she
would
be
glad
to
find
that
fraulein
hirsch
was
in
london
i
have
turned
the
entire
top
story
of
my
big
house
into
a
pretty
suite
for
her
she
has
a
fancy
for
living
high
above
the
street
smiled
lady
etynge
indulgently
perhaps
she
was
a
mother
person
robin
thought
both
her
looks
and
talk
were
kind
and
she
was
very
nice
in
her
sympathetic
interest
in
the
boats
and
the
children
efforts
to
sail
them
i
often
bring
my
book
here
and
forget
to
read
because
i
find
i
am
watching
them
she
said
they
are
so
eager
and
so
triumphant
when
a
boat
gets
across
the
pond
she
went
away
very
soon
and
robin
watched
her
out
of
sight
with
interest
they
saw
her
again
a
few
days
later
and
talked
a
little
more
she
was
not
always
near
the
pond
when
they
came
and
they
naturally
did
not
go
there
each
time
they
walked
together
though
fraulein
hirsch
was
fond
of
sitting
and
watching
the
children
she
had
been
to
take
tea
with
her
former
employer
she
told
robin
one
day
and
she
was
mildly
excited
by
the
preparations
for
helene
who
had
been
educated
entirely
in
a
french
convent
and
was
not
like
an
english
girl
at
all
she
had
always
been
very
delicate
and
the
nuns
seemed
to
know
how
to
take
care
of
her
and
calm
her
nerves
with
their
quiet
ways
her
mother
is
rather
anxious
about
her
coming
to
london
she
has
of
course
no
young
friends
here
and
she
is
so
used
to
the
quiet
of
convent
life
the
fraulein
explained
that
is
why
the
rooms
at
the
top
of
the
house
have
been
arranged
for
her
she
will
hear
so
little
sound
i
confess
i
am
anxious
about
her
myself
lady
etynge
is
wondering
if
she
can
find
a
suitable
young
companion
to
live
in
the
house
with
her
she
must
be
a
young
lady
and
perfectly
educated
and
with
brightness
and
charm
not
a
person
like
myself
but
one
who
can
be
treated
as
an
equal
and
a
friend
almost
a
playmate
it
would
be
an
agreeable
position
commented
robin
thoughtfully
extremely
so
answered
fraulein
hirsch
helene
is
a
most
lovable
and
affectionate
girl
and
lady
etynge
is
rich
enough
to
pay
a
large
salary
helene
is
her
idol
the
suite
of
rooms
is
perfect
in
germany
girls
are
not
spoiled
in
that
way
it
is
not
considered
good
for
them
it
was
quite
natural
since
she
felt
an
interest
in
helene
that
on
their
next
meeting
robin
should
find
pleasure
in
sitting
on
the
green
bench
near
the
girl
mother
and
hear
her
speak
of
her
daughter
she
was
not
diffuse
or
intimate
in
her
manner
helene
first
appeared
in
the
talk
as
a
result
of
a
polite
inquiry
made
by
fraulein
hirsch
robin
gathered
as
she
listened
that
this
particular
girl
was
a
tenderly
loved
and
cared
for
creature
and
was
herself
gentle
and
intelligent
and
loving
she
sounded
like
the
kind
of
a
girl
one
would
be
glad
to
have
for
a
friend
robin
wondered
and
wondered
if
she
would
do
perhaps
out
of
tactful
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
fraulein
hirsch
who
would
not
do
because
she
was
neither
bright
nor
pretty
nor
a
girl
lady
etynge
touched
but
lightly
on
her
idea
that
she
might
find
a
sort
of
sublimated
young
companion
for
her
daughter
it
would
be
difficult
to
advertise
for
what
one
wants
she
said
yes
to
state
that
a
girl
must
be
clever
and
pretty
and
graceful
and
attractive
would
make
it
difficult
for
a
modest
young
lady
to
write
a
suitable
reply
said
fraulein
hirsch
grimly
and
both
lady
etynge
and
robin
smiled
among
your
own
friends
lady
etynge
said
to
robin
a
little
pathetically
in
her
yearning
do
you
know
of
anyone
who
might
know
of
anyone
who
would
fit
in
sometimes
there
are
poor
little
cousins
you
know
or
girls
who
have
an
independent
spirit
and
would
like
to
support
themselves
said
the
fraulein
there
are
such
girls
in
these
advanced
times
i
am
afraid
i
do
know
anyone
answered
robin
modesty
also
prevented
her
from
saying
that
she
thought
she
did
she
herself
was
well
educated
she
was
good
tempered
and
well
bred
and
she
had
known
for
some
time
that
she
was
pretty
perhaps
fraulein
hirsch
may
bring
you
in
to
have
tea
with
me
some
afternoon
when
you
are
out
lady
etynge
said
kindly
before
she
left
them
i
think
you
would
like
to
see
helene
rooms
i
should
be
glad
to
hear
what
another
girl
thinks
of
them
robin
was
delighted
perhaps
this
was
a
way
opening
to
her
she
talked
to
mademoiselle
valle
about
it
and
so
glowed
with
hope
that
mademoiselle
heart
was
moved
do
you
think
i
might
go
she
said
do
you
think
there
is
any
chance
that
i
might
be
the
right
person
am
i
nice
enough
and
well
enough
educated
and
are
my
manners
good
she
did
not
know
exactly
where
lady
etynge
lived
but
believed
it
was
one
of
those
big
houses
in
a
certain
dignified
place
they
both
knew
a
corner
house
she
was
sure
because
by
mere
chance
she
had
one
day
seen
lady
etynge
go
into
such
a
house
as
if
it
were
her
own
she
did
not
know
the
number
but
they
could
ask
fraulein
fraulein
hirsch
was
quite
ready
with
detail
concerning
her
former
patroness
and
her
daughter
she
obviously
admired
them
very
much
her
manner
held
a
touch
of
respectful
reverence
she
described
helene
disposition
and
delicate
nerves
and
the
perfection
of
the
nuns
treatment
of
her
she
described
the
beauty
of
the
interior
of
the
house
its
luxury
and
convenience
and
the
charms
of
the
suite
of
apartments
prepared
for
helene
she
thought
the
number
of
the
house
was
no
a
lady
etynge
was
the
kindest
employer
she
had
ever
had
she
believed
that
miss
and
helene
would
be
delighted
with
each
other
if
they
met
and
her
impression
was
that
lady
etynge
privately
hoped
they
would
become
friends
her
mild
flat
face
was
so
modestly
amiable
that
mademoiselle
valle
who
always
felt
her
unattractive
femininity
pathetic
was
a
little
moved
by
her
evident
pleasure
in
having
been
the
humble
means
of
providing
robin
with
acquaintances
of
an
advantageous
kind
no
special
day
had
been
fixed
upon
for
the
visit
and
the
cup
of
tea
robin
was
eager
in
secret
and
hoped
lady
etynge
would
not
forget
to
remind
them
of
her
invitation
she
did
not
forget
one
afternoon
they
had
not
seen
her
for
several
days
and
had
not
really
expected
to
meet
her
because
they
took
their
walk
later
than
usual
they
found
her
just
rising
from
her
seat
to
go
home
as
they
appeared
our
little
encounters
almost
assume
the
air
of
appointments
she
said
this
is
very
nice
but
i
am
just
going
away
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
wonder
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
looked
at
fraulein
hirsch
pleasantly
i
wonder
if
in
about
an
hour
you
would
bring
miss
to
me
to
have
tea
and
tell
me
if
she
thinks
helene
will
like
her
new
rooms
you
said
you
would
like
to
see
them
brightly
to
robin
you
are
very
kind
i
should
like
it
so
much
was
robin
answer
fraulein
hirsch
was
correctly
appreciative
of
the
condescension
shown
to
her
her
manner
was
the
perfection
of
the
exact
shade
of
unobtrusive
chaperonship
there
was
no
improper
suggestion
of
a
mistaken
idea
that
she
was
herself
a
guest
or
indeed
anything
in
fact
but
a
proper
appendage
to
her
charge
robin
had
never
been
fond
of
fraulein
as
she
was
fond
of
mademoiselle
and
dowie
still
she
was
not
only
an
efficient
teacher
but
also
a
good
walker
and
very
fond
of
long
tramps
which
mademoiselle
was
really
not
strong
enough
for
but
which
robin
slender
young
legs
rejoiced
in
the
two
never
took
cabs
or
buses
but
always
walked
everywhere
they
walked
on
this
occasion
and
about
an
hour
later
arrived
at
a
large
corner
house
in
berford
place
a
tall
and
magnificently
built
footman
opened
the
door
for
them
and
they
were
handed
into
a
drawing
room
much
grander
than
the
one
robin
sometimes
glanced
into
as
she
passed
it
when
she
was
at
home
a
quite
beautiful
tea
equipage
awaited
them
on
a
small
table
but
lady
etynge
was
not
in
the
room
what
a
beautiful
house
to
live
in
said
robin
but
do
you
know
the
number
is
i
looked
as
we
came
in
and
it
is
no
is
it
i
ought
to
have
been
more
careful
answered
fraulein
hirsch
it
is
wrong
to
be
careless
even
in
small
matters
almost
immediately
lady
etynge
came
in
and
greeted
them
with
a
sort
of
gentle
delight
she
drew
robin
down
on
to
a
sofa
beside
her
and
took
her
hand
and
gave
it
a
light
pat
which
was
a
caress
now
you
really
are
here
she
said
i
have
been
so
busy
that
i
have
been
afraid
i
should
not
have
time
to
show
you
the
rooms
before
it
was
too
late
to
make
a
change
if
you
thought
anything
might
be
improved
i
am
sure
nothing
can
improve
them
said
robin
more
than
usual
and
even
a
thought
breathless
because
this
was
really
a
sort
of
adventure
and
she
longed
to
ask
if
by
any
chance
she
would
do
and
she
was
so
afraid
that
she
might
lose
this
amazingly
good
opportunity
merely
because
she
was
too
young
and
inexperienced
to
know
how
she
ought
to
broach
the
subject
she
had
not
thought
yet
of
asking
mademoiselle
valle
how
it
should
be
done
she
was
not
aware
that
she
looked
at
lady
etynge
with
a
heavenly
little
unconscious
appeal
which
made
her
enchanting
lady
etynge
looked
at
her
quite
fixedly
for
an
instant
what
a
child
you
are
and
what
a
colour
your
cheeks
and
lips
are
she
said
you
are
much
much
prettier
than
helene
my
dear
she
got
up
and
brought
a
picture
from
a
side
table
to
show
it
to
her
i
think
she
is
lovely
she
said
is
it
became
i
am
her
mother
oh
no
not
because
you
are
her
mother
exclaimed
robin
she
is
angelic
she
was
rather
angelic
with
her
delicate
uplifted
face
and
her
communion
veil
framing
it
mistily
the
picture
was
placed
near
them
and
robin
looked
at
is
many
times
as
they
took
their
tea
to
be
a
companion
to
a
girl
with
a
face
like
that
would
be
almost
too
much
to
ask
of
one
luck
there
was
actual
yearning
in
robin
heart
suddenly
she
realized
that
she
had
missed
something
all
her
life
without
knowing
that
she
missed
it
it
was
the
friendly
nearness
of
youth
like
her
own
how
she
hoped
that
she
might
make
lady
etynge
like
her
after
tea
was
over
lady
etynge
spoke
pleasantly
to
fraulein
hirsch
i
know
that
you
wanted
to
register
a
letter
there
is
a
just
around
the
corner
would
you
like
to
go
and
register
it
while
i
take
miss
upstairs
you
have
seen
the
rooms
you
will
only
be
away
a
few
minutes
fraulein
hirsch
was
respectfully
appreciative
again
the
letter
really
was
important
it
contained
money
which
she
sent
monthly
to
her
parents
this
month
she
was
rather
late
and
she
would
be
very
glad
to
be
allowed
to
attend
to
the
matter
without
losing
a
post
so
she
went
out
of
the
and
down
the
stairs
and
robin
heard
the
front
door
close
behind
her
with
a
slight
thud
she
had
evidently
opened
and
closed
it
herself
without
waiting
for
the
footman
the
upper
rooms
in
london
houses
even
in
the
large
ones
are
usually
given
up
to
servants
bedrooms
nurseries
and
school
rooms
stately
staircases
become
narrower
as
they
mount
and
the
climber
gets
glimpses
of
apartments
which
are
frequently
bare
whatsoever
their
use
and
if
not
grubby
in
aspect
are
dull
and
uninteresting
but
in
lady
etynge
house
it
was
plain
that
a
good
deal
had
been
done
stairs
had
been
altered
and
widened
walls
had
been
given
fresh
and
delicate
tints
and
one
laid
one
hand
on
cream
white
balustrades
and
trod
on
soft
carpets
a
good
architect
had
taken
interest
in
the
problems
presented
to
him
and
the
result
was
admirable
partitions
must
have
been
removed
to
make
rooms
larger
and
of
better
shape
nothing
could
be
altered
without
spoiling
it
exclaimed
robin
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
sitting
room
all
freshness
and
exquisite
colour
the
very
pictures
on
the
wall
being
part
of
the
harmony
all
that
a
girl
would
want
or
love
was
there
there
was
nothing
left
undone
unremembered
the
soft
chesterfield
lounge
which
was
not
too
big
and
was
placed
near
the
fire
the
writing
table
the
books
the
piano
of
satinwood
inlaid
with
garlands
the
lamp
to
sit
and
read
by
how
glad
she
must
be
to
come
back
to
anyone
who
loves
her
so
said
robin
here
was
a
quilted
basket
with
three
persian
kittens
purring
in
it
and
she
knelt
and
stroked
their
fluffiness
bending
her
slim
neck
and
showing
how
prettily
the
dark
hair
grew
up
from
it
it
was
perhaps
that
at
which
lady
etynge
was
looking
as
she
stood
behind
her
and
watched
her
the
slenderness
and
flexibility
of
her
leaning
body
was
almost
touchingly
lovely
there
were
several
other
rooms
and
each
one
was
in
its
way
more
charming
than
the
other
a
library
in
dresden
blue
and
white
and
with
peculiarly
pretty
windows
struck
the
last
note
of
cosiness
all
the
rooms
had
pretty
windows
with
rather
small
square
panes
enclosed
in
white
frames
it
was
when
she
was
in
this
room
that
robin
took
her
courage
in
her
hands
she
must
not
let
her
chance
go
by
lady
etynge
was
so
kind
she
wondered
if
it
would
seem
gauche
and
too
informal
to
speak
now
she
stood
quite
upright
and
still
though
her
voice
was
not
quite
steady
when
she
began
lady
etynge
she
said
you
remember
what
fraulein
hirsch
said
about
girls
who
wish
to
support
themselves
i
i
am
one
of
them
i
want
very
much
to
earn
my
own
living
i
think
i
am
well
educated
i
have
been
allowed
to
read
a
good
deal
and
my
teachers
mademoiselle
valle
and
fraulein
hirsch
say
i
speak
and
write
french
and
german
well
for
an
english
girl
if
you
thought
i
could
be
a
suitable
companion
for
miss
etynge
i
should
be
very
happy
how
curiously
lady
etynge
watched
her
as
she
spoke
she
did
not
look
displeased
but
there
was
something
in
her
face
which
made
robin
afraid
that
she
was
perhaps
after
all
not
the
girl
who
was
fortunate
enough
to
quite
do
she
felt
her
hopes
raised
a
degree
however
when
lady
etynge
smiled
at
her
do
you
know
i
feel
that
is
very
pretty
of
you
she
said
it
quite
delights
me
as
i
am
an
idolizing
mother
that
my
mere
talk
of
helene
should
have
made
you
like
her
well
enough
to
think
you
might
care
to
live
with
her
and
i
confess
i
am
modern
enough
to
be
pleased
with
your
wishing
to
earn
your
own
living
i
must
said
robin
i
must
i
could
not
bear
not
to
earn
it
she
spoke
a
little
suddenly
and
a
flag
of
new
colour
fluttered
in
her
cheek
when
helene
comes
you
must
meet
if
you
like
each
other
as
i
feel
sure
you
will
and
if
does
not
object
if
it
remains
only
a
matter
of
being
suitable
you
are
suitable
my
dear
you
are
suitable
she
touched
robin
hand
with
the
light
pat
which
was
a
caress
and
the
child
was
radiant
oh
you
are
kind
to
me
the
words
broke
from
her
involuntarily
and
it
is
such
good
fortune
thank
you
thank
you
lady
etynge
the
flush
of
her
joy
and
relief
had
not
died
out
before
the
footman
who
had
opened
the
door
appeared
on
the
threshold
he
was
a
handsome
young
fellow
whose
eyes
were
not
as
professionally
impassive
as
his
face
a
footman
had
no
right
to
dart
a
swift
side
look
at
one
as
people
did
in
the
street
he
did
dart
such
a
glance
robin
saw
and
she
was
momentarily
struck
by
its
being
one
of
those
she
sometimes
objected
to
otherwise
his
manner
was
without
flaw
he
had
only
come
to
announce
to
his
mistress
the
arrival
of
a
caller
when
lady
etynge
took
the
card
from
the
salver
her
expression
changed
she
even
looked
slightly
disturbed
oh
i
am
sorry
she
murmured
i
must
see
her
lifting
her
eyes
to
robin
it
is
an
old
friend
merely
passing
through
london
how
wicked
of
me
to
forget
that
she
wrote
to
say
that
she
might
dash
in
at
any
hour
please
pled
robin
prettily
i
can
run
away
at
once
fraulein
hirsch
must
have
come
back
please
the
lady
asked
me
particularly
to
say
that
she
has
only
a
few
minutes
to
stay
as
she
is
catching
a
train
the
footman
decorously
ventured
if
that
is
the
case
lady
etynge
said
even
relievedly
i
will
leave
you
here
to
look
at
things
until
i
come
back
i
really
want
to
talk
to
you
a
little
more
about
yourself
and
helene
i
ca
let
you
go
she
looked
back
from
the
door
before
she
passed
through
it
amuse
yourself
my
dear
and
then
she
added
hastily
to
the
man
have
you
remembered
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
latch
william
see
if
it
needs
a
locksmith
very
good
my
lady
she
was
gone
and
robin
stood
by
the
sofa
thrilled
with
happiness
and
relief
how
wonderful
it
was
that
through
mere
lucky
chance
she
had
gone
to
watch
the
children
sailing
their
boats
and
that
fraulein
hirsch
had
seen
lady
etynge
what
good
luck
and
how
grateful
she
was
the
thought
which
passed
through
her
mind
was
like
a
little
prayer
of
thanks
how
strange
it
would
be
to
be
really
intimate
with
a
girl
like
herself
or
rather
like
helene
it
made
her
heart
beat
to
think
of
it
how
wonderful
it
would
be
if
helene
actually
loved
her
and
she
loved
helene
something
sprang
out
of
some
depths
of
her
being
where
past
things
were
hidden
the
something
was
a
deadly
little
memory
donal
donal
it
would
be
if
she
loved
helene
and
helene
loved
her
as
new
a
revelation
as
donal
oh
she
remembered
she
heard
the
footman
doing
something
to
the
latch
of
the
door
which
caused
it
to
make
a
clicking
sound
he
was
obeying
orders
and
examining
it
as
she
involuntarily
glanced
at
him
he
bending
over
the
door
handle
raised
his
eyes
sideways
and
glanced
at
her
it
was
an
inexcusable
glance
from
a
domestic
because
it
was
actually
as
if
he
were
taking
the
liberty
of
privately
summing
her
up
taking
her
points
in
for
his
own
entertainment
she
so
resented
the
unprofessional
bad
manners
of
it
that
she
turned
away
and
sauntered
into
the
dresden
blue
and
white
library
and
sat
down
with
a
book
she
was
quite
relieved
when
only
a
few
minutes
later
he
went
away
having
evidently
done
what
he
could
the
book
she
had
picked
up
was
a
new
novel
and
opened
with
an
agreeableness
which
led
her
on
in
fact
it
led
her
on
further
and
for
a
longer
time
than
she
was
aware
of
it
was
her
way
to
become
wholly
absorbed
in
books
when
they
allured
her
she
forgot
her
surroundings
and
forgot
the
passing
of
time
this
was
a
new
book
by
a
strong
man
with
the
gift
which
makes
alive
people
places
things
the
ones
whose
lives
had
taken
possession
of
his
being
in
this
story
were
throbbing
with
vital
truth
she
read
on
and
on
because
from
the
first
page
she
knew
them
as
actual
pulsating
human
creatures
they
looked
into
her
face
they
laughed
she
heard
their
voices
she
cared
for
every
trivial
thing
that
happened
to
them
to
any
of
them
if
one
of
them
picked
a
flower
she
saw
how
he
or
she
held
it
and
its
scent
was
in
the
air
having
been
so
drawn
on
into
a
sort
of
unconsciousness
of
all
else
it
was
inevitable
that
when
she
suddenly
became
aware
that
she
did
not
see
her
page
quite
clearly
she
should
withdraw
her
eyes
from
her
page
and
look
about
her
as
she
did
so
she
started
from
her
comfortable
chair
in
amazement
and
some
alarm
the
room
had
become
so
much
darker
that
it
must
be
getting
late
how
careless
and
silly
she
had
been
where
was
fraulein
hirsch
i
am
only
a
strange
girl
and
lady
etynge
might
so
easily
have
forgotten
me
passed
through
her
mind
her
friend
may
have
stayed
and
they
may
have
had
so
much
to
talk
about
that
of
coarse
i
was
forgotten
but
fraulein
hirsch
how
could
she
then
remembering
the
subservient
humility
of
the
fraulein
mind
she
wondered
if
it
could
have
been
possible
that
she
had
been
too
timid
to
do
more
than
sit
waiting
in
the
hall
perhaps
afraid
to
allow
the
footman
to
disturb
lady
etynge
by
asking
her
where
her
pupil
was
the
poor
meek
silly
thing
i
must
get
away
without
disturbing
anyone
she
thought
i
will
slip
downstairs
and
snatch
fraulein
hirsch
from
her
seat
and
we
will
go
quietly
out
i
can
write
a
nice
note
to
lady
etynge
tomorrow
and
explain
i
hope
she
wo
mind
having
forgotten
me
i
must
make
her
feel
sure
that
it
did
not
matter
in
the
least
i
tell
her
about
the
book
she
replaced
the
book
on
the
shelf
from
which
she
had
taken
it
and
passed
through
into
the
delightful
sitting
room
the
kittens
were
playing
together
on
the
hearth
having
deserted
their
basket
one
of
them
gave
a
soft
airy
pounce
after
her
and
caught
at
her
dress
with
tiny
claws
rolling
over
and
over
after
his
ineffectual
snatch
she
had
not
heard
the
footman
close
the
door
when
he
left
the
room
but
she
found
he
must
have
done
so
as
it
was
now
shut
when
she
turned
the
handle
it
did
not
seem
to
work
well
because
the
door
did
not
open
as
it
ought
to
have
done
she
turned
it
again
and
gave
it
a
little
pull
but
it
still
remained
tightly
shut
she
turned
it
again
still
with
no
result
and
then
she
tried
the
small
latch
perhaps
the
man
had
done
some
blundering
thing
when
he
had
been
examining
it
she
remembered
hearing
several
clicks
she
turned
the
handle
again
and
again
there
was
no
key
in
the
keyhole
so
he
could
not
have
bungled
with
the
key
she
was
quite
aghast
at
the
embarrassment
of
the
situation
how
can
i
get
out
without
disturbing
anyone
if
i
can
not
open
the
door
she
said
how
stupid
i
shall
seem
to
lady
etynge
she
wo
like
it
a
girl
who
could
forget
where
she
was
and
then
not
be
able
to
open
a
door
and
be
obliged
to
bang
until
people
come
suddenly
she
remembered
that
there
had
been
a
door
in
the
bedroom
which
had
seemed
to
lead
out
into
the
hall
she
ran
into
the
room
in
such
a
hurry
that
all
three
kittens
ran
frisking
after
her
she
saw
she
had
not
been
mistaken
there
was
a
door
she
went
to
it
and
turned
the
handle
breathless
with
excitement
and
relief
but
the
handle
of
that
door
also
would
not
open
it
neither
would
the
latch
and
there
was
no
key
oh
she
gasped
oh
then
she
remembered
the
electric
bell
near
the
fireplace
in
the
sitting
room
there
was
one
by
the
fireplace
here
also
no
she
would
ring
the
one
in
the
sitting
room
she
went
to
it
and
pressed
the
button
she
could
not
hear
the
ghost
of
a
sound
and
one
could
generally
hear
something
like
one
she
rang
again
and
waited
the
room
was
getting
darker
oh
how
could
fraulein
hirsch
how
could
she
she
waited
she
waited
fifteen
minutes
by
her
little
watch
twenty
minutes
and
in
their
passing
she
rang
again
she
rang
the
bell
in
the
library
and
the
one
in
the
bedroom
even
the
one
in
the
bathroom
lest
some
might
be
out
of
order
she
slowly
ceased
to
be
embarrassed
and
and
began
to
feel
afraid
though
she
did
not
know
quite
what
she
was
afraid
of
she
went
to
one
of
the
windows
to
look
at
her
watch
again
in
the
vanishing
light
and
saw
that
she
had
been
ringing
the
bells
for
an
hour
she
automatically
put
up
a
hand
and
leaned
against
the
white
frame
of
one
of
the
decorative
small
panes
of
glass
as
she
touched
it
she
vaguely
realized
that
it
was
of
such
a
solidity
that
it
felt
not
like
wood
but
iron
she
drew
her
hand
away
quickly
feeling
a
sweep
of
unexplainable
fear
yes
it
was
fear
and
why
should
she
so
suddenly
feel
it
she
went
back
to
the
door
and
tried
again
to
open
it
as
ineffectively
as
before
then
she
began
to
feel
a
little
cold
and
sick
she
returned
to
the
chesterfield
and
sat
down
on
it
helplessly
it
seems
as
if
i
had
been
locked
in
she
broke
out
in
a
faint
bewildered
wail
of
a
whisper
oh
why
did
they
lock
the
doors
chapter
xxii
she
had
known
none
of
the
absolute
horrors
of
life
which
were
possible
in
that
underworld
which
was
not
likely
to
touch
her
own
existence
in
any
form
why
had
argued
mademoiselle
valle
should
one
fill
a
white
young
mind
with
ugly
images
which
would
deface
with
dark
marks
and
smears
and
could
only
produce
unhappiness
and
perhaps
morbid
broodings
one
does
not
feel
it
is
wise
to
give
a
girl
an
education
in
crime
one
would
not
permit
her
to
read
the
newgate
calendar
for
choice
she
will
be
protected
by
those
who
love
her
and
what
she
must
discover
she
will
discover
that
is
life
which
was
why
her
first
discovery
that
neither
door
could
be
opened
did
not
at
once
fill
her
with
horror
her
first
arguments
were
merely
those
of
a
girl
who
though
her
brain
was
not
inactive
pulp
had
still
a
protected
girl
outlook
she
had
been
overwhelmed
by
a
sense
of
the
awkwardness
of
her
position
and
by
the
dread
that
she
would
be
obliged
to
disturb
and
almost
inevitably
embarrass
and
annoy
lady
etynge
of
course
there
had
been
some
bungling
on
the
part
of
the
impudent
footman
perhaps
actually
at
the
moment
when
he
had
given
his
sidelong
leer
at
herself
instead
of
properly
attending
to
what
he
was
trying
to
do
that
the
bedroom
was
locked
might
be
the
result
of
a
dozen
ordinary
reasons
the
first
hint
of
an
abnormality
of
conditions
came
after
she
had
rung
the
bells
and
had
waited
in
vain
for
response
to
her
summons
there
were
servants
whose
business
it
was
to
answer
bells
at
once
if
all
the
bells
were
out
of
order
why
were
they
out
of
order
when
helene
was
to
return
in
a
few
days
and
her
apartment
was
supposed
to
be
complete
even
to
the
kittens
even
to
the
kittens
it
seems
as
if
i
had
been
locked
in
she
had
whispered
to
the
silence
of
the
room
why
did
they
lock
the
doors
then
she
said
and
her
heart
began
to
thump
and
race
in
her
side
it
has
been
done
on
purpose
they
do
intend
to
let
me
out
for
some
horrible
reason
perhaps
even
her
own
growing
panic
was
not
so
appalling
as
a
sudden
rushing
memory
of
lady
etynge
which
at
this
moment
overthrew
her
lady
etynge
lady
etynge
she
saw
her
gentle
face
and
almost
affectionately
watching
eyes
she
heard
her
voice
as
she
spoke
of
helene
she
felt
the
light
pat
which
was
a
caress
no
no
she
gasped
it
because
her
breath
had
almost
left
her
no
no
she
could
no
one
could
there
is
nothing
as
wicked
as
that
bat
even
as
she
cried
out
the
overthrow
was
utter
and
she
threw
herself
forward
on
the
arm
of
the
couch
and
sobbed
sobbed
with
the
passion
she
had
only
known
on
the
day
long
ago
when
she
had
crawled
into
the
shrubs
and
groveled
in
the
earth
it
was
the
same
kind
of
passion
the
shaken
and
woe
of
a
creature
who
has
trusted
and
hoped
joyously
and
has
been
forever
betrayed
the
face
and
eyes
had
been
so
kind
the
voice
so
friendly
oh
how
could
even
the
wickedest
girl
in
the
world
have
doubted
their
sincerity
unfortunately
or
fortunately
she
knew
nothing
whatever
of
the
mental
processes
of
the
wicked
girls
of
the
world
which
was
why
she
lay
broken
to
pieces
sobbing
sobbing
not
at
the
moment
because
she
was
a
trapped
thing
but
because
lady
etynge
had
a
face
in
whose
gentleness
her
heart
had
trusted
and
rejoiced
when
she
sat
upright
again
her
own
face
as
she
lifted
it
would
have
struck
a
perceptive
onlooker
as
being
as
it
were
the
face
of
another
girl
it
was
and
wild
but
this
was
not
the
cause
of
its
change
the
soft
bird
eyes
were
different
suddenly
amazingly
older
than
they
had
been
when
she
had
believed
in
helene
she
had
no
experience
which
could
reveal
to
her
in
a
moment
the
monstrousness
of
her
danger
but
all
she
had
ever
read
or
vaguely
gathered
of
law
breakers
and
marauders
of
society
collected
itself
into
an
advancing
tidal
wave
of
horror
she
rose
and
went
to
the
window
and
tried
to
open
it
but
it
was
not
intended
to
open
the
decorative
panes
were
of
small
size
and
of
thick
glass
her
first
startled
impression
that
the
white
framework
seemed
to
be
a
painted
metal
was
apparently
founded
on
fact
a
strong
person
might
have
bent
it
with
a
hammer
but
he
could
not
have
broken
it
she
examined
the
windows
in
the
other
rooms
and
they
were
of
the
same
structure
they
are
made
like
that
she
said
to
herself
stonily
to
prevent
people
from
getting
out
she
stood
at
the
front
one
and
looked
down
into
the
broad
stately
place
it
was
a
long
way
to
look
down
and
even
if
the
window
could
be
opened
one
voice
would
not
be
heard
the
street
lamps
were
lighted
and
a
few
people
were
to
be
seen
walking
past
unhurriedly
in
the
big
house
almost
opposite
they
are
going
to
give
a
party
there
is
a
red
carpet
rolled
out
carriages
are
beginning
to
drive
up
and
here
on
the
top
floor
there
is
a
girl
locked
up
and
they
do
know
she
said
it
aloud
and
her
voice
sounded
as
though
it
were
not
her
own
it
was
a
dreadful
voice
and
as
she
heard
it
panic
seized
her
nobody
knew
nobody
her
mother
never
either
knew
or
cared
where
she
was
but
dowie
and
mademoiselle
always
knew
they
would
be
terrified
fraulein
hirsch
had
perhaps
been
told
that
her
pupil
had
taken
a
cab
and
gone
home
and
she
would
return
to
her
lodgings
thinking
she
was
safe
then
only
at
this
moment
and
with
a
suddenness
which
produced
a
sense
of
shock
she
recalled
that
it
was
fraulein
hirsch
who
had
presented
her
to
lady
etynge
fraulein
hirsch
herself
it
was
she
who
had
said
she
had
been
in
her
employ
and
had
taught
helene
helene
it
was
she
who
had
related
anecdotes
about
the
convent
at
tours
and
the
nuns
who
were
so
wise
and
kind
robin
hand
went
up
to
her
forehead
with
a
gesture
fraulein
hirsch
had
made
an
excuse
for
leaving
her
with
lady
etynge
to
be
brought
up
to
the
top
of
the
house
quite
alone
and
locked
in
fraulein
hirsch
had
known
and
there
came
back
to
her
the
memory
of
the
furtive
eyes
whose
sly
adoring
sidelooks
at
count
von
hillern
had
always
though
she
had
tried
not
to
feel
it
been
somehow
glances
she
had
disliked
yes
disliked
it
was
here
by
the
thread
of
fraulein
hirsch
that
count
von
hillern
was
drawn
into
her
mind
once
there
it
was
as
if
he
stood
near
her
quite
close
looking
down
under
his
heavy
drooping
lids
with
stealthy
plunging
eyes
it
had
always
been
when
fraulein
hirsch
had
walked
with
her
that
they
had
met
him
almost
as
if
by
arrangement
there
were
only
two
people
in
the
world
who
might
because
she
herself
had
so
hated
them
dislike
and
choose
in
some
way
to
punish
her
one
was
count
von
hillern
the
other
was
lord
coombe
lord
coombe
she
knew
was
bad
vicious
did
the
things
people
only
hinted
at
without
speaking
of
them
plainly
a
sense
of
instinctive
revolt
in
the
strength
of
her
antipathy
to
von
hillern
made
her
feel
that
he
must
be
of
the
same
order
if
either
of
them
came
into
this
room
now
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
i
could
not
get
out
she
heard
herself
say
it
aloud
in
the
strange
girl
dreadful
voice
as
she
had
heard
herself
speak
of
the
party
in
the
big
house
opposite
she
put
her
soft
slim
hand
up
to
her
soft
slim
throat
i
could
not
get
out
she
repeated
she
ran
to
the
door
and
began
to
beat
on
its
panels
by
this
time
she
knew
it
would
be
no
use
and
yet
she
beat
with
her
hands
until
they
were
bruised
and
then
she
snatched
up
a
book
and
beat
with
that
she
thought
she
must
have
been
beating
half
an
hour
when
she
realized
that
someone
was
standing
outside
in
the
corridor
and
the
someone
said
in
a
voice
she
recognized
as
belonging
to
the
leering
footman
may
as
well
keep
still
miss
you
ca
hammer
it
down
and
no
one
going
to
bother
taking
any
notice
and
then
his
footsteps
retired
down
the
stairs
she
involuntarily
clenched
her
hurt
hands
and
the
shuddering
began
again
though
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
a
rigid
body
and
her
head
thrown
fiercely
back
if
there
are
people
in
the
world
as
hideous
and
monstrous
as
this
let
them
kill
me
if
they
want
to
i
would
rather
be
killed
than
live
they
would
have
to
kill
me
and
she
said
it
in
a
frenzy
of
defiance
of
all
mad
and
base
things
on
earth
her
peril
seemed
to
force
her
thought
to
delve
into
unknown
dark
places
in
her
memory
and
dig
up
horrors
she
had
forgotten
newspaper
stories
of
crime
old
melodramas
and
mystery
romances
in
which
people
disappeared
and
were
long
afterwards
found
buried
under
floors
or
in
cellars
it
was
said
that
the
berford
place
houses
winch
were
old
ones
had
enormous
cellars
under
them
perhaps
other
girls
have
disappeared
and
now
are
buried
in
the
cellars
she
thought
and
the
dreadful
young
voice
added
aloud
because
they
would
have
to
kill
me
one
of
the
persian
kittens
curled
up
in
the
basket
wakened
because
he
heard
it
and
stretched
a
sleepy
paw
and
mewed
at
her
coombe
house
was
one
of
the
old
ones
wearing
somewhat
the
aspect
of
a
stately
barrack
with
a
fine
entrance
its
court
was
enclosed
at
the
front
by
a
stone
wall
outside
which
passing
london
roared
in
low
tumult
the
court
was
surrounded
by
a
belt
of
shrubs
strong
enough
to
defy
the
rain
of
soot
which
fell
quietly
upon
them
day
and
night
the
streets
were
already
lighted
for
the
evening
when
mademoiselle
valle
presented
herself
at
the
massive
front
door
and
asked
for
lord
coombe
the
expression
of
her
face
and
a
certain
intensity
of
manner
caused
the
head
servant
who
wore
no
livery
to
come
forward
instead
of
leaving
her
to
the
footmen
his
lordship
engaged
with
a
business
person
and
must
not
be
disturbed
he
said
he
is
also
going
out
he
will
see
me
replied
mademoiselle
valle
if
you
give
him
this
card
he
will
see
me
she
was
a
plainly
dressed
woman
but
she
had
a
manner
which
removed
her
entirely
from
the
class
of
those
who
merely
came
to
importune
there
was
absolute
certainty
in
the
eyes
she
fixed
with
steadiness
on
the
man
face
he
took
her
card
though
he
hesitated
if
he
does
not
see
me
she
added
he
will
be
very
much
displeased
will
you
come
in
and
take
a
seat
for
a
moment
he
ventured
i
will
inquire
the
great
hall
was
one
of
london
most
celebrated
a
magnificent
staircase
swept
up
from
it
to
landings
whose
walls
were
hung
with
tapestries
the
world
knew
in
a
gilded
chair
like
a
throne
mademoiselle
valle
sat
and
waited
but
she
did
not
wait
long
the
man
without
livery
returned
almost
immediately
he
led
mademoiselle
into
a
room
like
a
sort
of
study
or
apartment
given
up
to
business
matters
mademoiselle
valle
had
never
seen
lord
coombe
ceremonial
evening
effect
more
flawless
tall
thin
and
finely
straight
he
waited
in
the
centre
of
the
room
he
was
evidently
on
the
point
of
going
out
and
the
overcoat
he
had
already
thrown
on
revealed
through
a
suggestion
of
being
winged
that
he
wore
in
his
lapel
a
delicately
fresh
carnation
a
respectable
looking
man
with
a
steady
face
had
been
talking
to
him
and
stepped
quietly
aside
as
mademoiselle
entered
there
seemed
to
be
no
question
of
his
leaving
the
room
coombe
met
his
visitor
half
way
something
has
alarmed
you
very
much
he
said
robin
went
out
with
fraulein
hirsch
this
afternoon
she
said
quickly
they
went
to
kensington
gardens
they
have
not
come
back
and
it
is
nine
they
are
always
at
home
by
six
will
you
sit
down
he
said
the
man
with
the
steady
face
was
listening
intently
and
she
realized
he
was
doing
so
and
that
somehow
it
was
well
that
he
should
i
do
not
think
there
is
time
for
any
one
to
sit
down
she
said
speaking
more
quickly
than
before
it
is
not
only
that
she
has
not
come
back
fraulein
hirsch
has
presented
her
to
one
of
her
old
lady
etynge
robin
was
delighted
with
her
she
has
a
daughter
who
is
in
france
marguerite
staying
with
her
aunt
in
paris
suddenly
put
in
the
voice
of
the
man
from
his
side
of
the
room
helene
at
a
covent
in
tours
corrected
mademoiselle
turning
a
paling
countenance
towards
him
and
then
upon
coombe
lady
etynge
spoke
of
wanting
to
engage
some
nice
girl
as
a
companion
to
her
daughter
who
is
coming
home
robin
thought
she
might
have
the
good
fortune
to
please
her
she
was
to
go
to
lady
etynge
house
to
tea
sine
afternoon
and
be
shown
the
rooms
prepared
for
helene
she
thought
the
mother
charming
did
she
mention
the
address
coombe
asked
at
once
the
house
was
in
berford
large
house
at
a
corner
she
chanced
to
see
lady
etynge
go
into
it
one
day
or
we
should
not
have
known
she
did
not
notice
the
number
fraulein
hirsch
thought
it
was
i
have
the
blue
book
lord
coombe
through
the
peerage
through
the
directory
there
is
no
lady
etynge
and
there
is
no
in
berford
place
that
is
why
i
came
here
the
man
who
had
stood
aside
stepped
forward
again
it
was
as
if
he
answered
some
sign
though
lord
coombe
at
the
moment
crossed
the
hearth
and
rang
the
bell
scotland
yard
knows
that
said
the
man
we
had
our
eyes
on
that
house
for
two
weeks
and
this
kind
of
thing
is
what
we
want
the
double
brougham
was
coombe
order
to
the
servant
who
answered
his
ring
then
he
came
back
to
mademoiselle
barkstow
is
a
detective
he
said
among
the
other
things
he
has
done
for
me
he
has
for
some
time
kept
a
casual
eye
on
robin
she
is
too
lovely
a
child
and
too
friendless
to
be
quite
safe
there
are
blackguards
who
know
when
a
girl
has
not
the
usual
family
protection
he
came
here
to
tell
me
that
she
had
been
seen
sitting
in
kensington
gardens
with
a
woman
scotland
yard
has
reason
to
suspect
a
black
said
barkstow
savagely
if
she
the
one
we
think
she
black
poisonous
sly
one
with
a
face
that
no
girl
could
suspect
coombe
still
countenance
was
so
deadly
in
the
slow
lividness
which
mademoiselle
saw
began
to
manifest
itself
that
she
caught
his
sleeve
with
a
shaking
hand
she
nothing
but
a
baby
she
said
she
does
know
what
a
baby
she
is
i
can
see
her
eyes
frantic
with
terror
she
go
mad
good
god
he
said
in
a
voice
so
low
it
scarcely
audible
he
almost
dragged
her
out
of
the
room
though
as
they
passed
through
the
hall
the
servants
only
saw
that
he
had
given
the
lady
his
two
of
the
younger
footmen
exchanged
glances
with
each
other
which
referred
solely
to
the
inimitableness
of
the
cut
of
his
evening
overcoat
when
they
entered
the
carriage
barkstow
entered
with
them
and
mademoiselle
valle
leaned
forward
with
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
her
face
clutched
in
her
hands
she
was
trying
to
shut
out
from
her
mental
vision
a
memory
of
robin
eyes
if
if
fraulein
hirsch
is
not
true
she
broke
out
once
count
von
hillern
is
concerned
it
has
come
upon
me
like
a
flash
why
did
i
not
see
before
the
party
at
the
big
house
where
the
red
carpet
was
rolled
across
the
pavement
was
at
full
height
when
they
drove
into
the
place
their
brougham
did
not
stop
at
the
corner
but
at
the
end
of
the
line
of
waiting
carriages
coombe
got
out
and
looked
up
and
down
the
thoroughfare
it
must
be
done
quietly
there
must
be
no
scandal
he
said
the
policeman
on
the
beat
is
an
enormous
fellow
you
will
attend
to
him
barkstow
and
barkstow
nodded
and
strolled
away
coombe
walked
up
the
place
and
down
on
the
opposite
side
until
he
was
within
a
few
yards
of
the
corner
house
when
he
reached
this
point
he
suddenly
quickened
his
footsteps
because
he
saw
that
someone
else
was
approaching
it
with
an
air
of
intention
it
was
a
man
not
quite
as
tall
as
himself
but
of
heavier
build
and
with
square
held
shoulders
as
the
man
set
his
foot
upon
the
step
coombe
touched
him
on
the
arm
and
said
something
in
german
the
man
started
angrily
and
then
suddenly
stood
quite
still
and
erect
it
will
be
better
for
us
to
walk
up
the
place
together
lord
coombe
said
with
perfect
politeness
if
he
could
have
been
dashed
down
upon
the
pavement
and
his
head
hammered
in
with
the
handle
of
a
sword
or
if
he
could
have
been
run
through
furiously
again
and
again
either
or
both
of
these
things
would
have
been
done
but
neither
was
possible
it
also
was
not
possible
to
curse
aloud
in
a
fashionable
london
street
such
curses
as
one
uttered
must
be
held
in
one
foaming
mouth
between
one
teeth
count
von
hillern
knew
this
better
than
most
men
would
have
known
it
here
was
one
of
those
english
swine
with
whom
germany
would
deal
in
her
own
way
later
they
walked
back
together
as
if
they
were
acquaintances
taking
a
casual
stroll
there
is
nothing
which
would
so
infuriate
your
a
disgraceful
scandal
lord
coombe
highbred
voice
suggested
undisturbedly
the
high
honour
of
a
german
knightly
bearing
of
a
wearer
of
the
uniform
of
the
all
sort
of
thing
you
know
all
that
sort
of
thing
von
hillern
ground
out
some
low
spoken
and
quite
awful
german
words
if
he
had
not
been
he
had
been
in
some
quiet
the
man
walking
ahead
of
us
is
a
detective
from
scotland
yard
the
particularly
heavy
and
rather
martial
tread
behind
us
is
that
of
a
policeman
much
more
muscular
than
either
of
us
there
is
a
ball
going
on
in
the
large
house
with
the
red
carpet
spread
across
the
pavement
i
know
the
people
who
are
giving
it
there
are
a
good
many
coachmen
and
footmen
about
most
of
them
would
probably
recognize
me
it
became
necessary
for
count
von
hillern
actually
to
wipe
away
certain
flecks
of
foam
from
his
lips
as
he
ground
forth
again
more
varied
and
awful
sentiments
in
his
native
tongue
you
are
going
back
to
berlin
said
coombe
coldly
if
we
english
were
not
such
fools
you
would
not
be
here
you
are
of
course
not
going
into
that
house
von
hillern
burst
into
a
derisive
laugh
you
are
going
yourself
he
said
you
are
a
old
roue
but
you
are
mad
about
her
yourself
in
your
senile
way
you
should
respect
my
age
and
decrepitude
answered
coombe
a
certain
pity
for
my
gray
hairs
would
become
your
youth
shall
we
turn
here
or
will
you
return
to
your
hotel
by
some
other
way
he
felt
as
if
the
man
might
a
burst
a
blood
vessel
if
he
were
obliged
to
further
restrain
himself
von
hillern
wheeled
at
the
corner
and
confronted
him
there
will
come
a
day
he
almost
choked
der
toy
naturally
the
chill
of
coombe
voice
was
a
sound
to
drive
this
particular
man
at
this
particular
moment
raving
mad
and
not
to
be
able
to
go
mad
not
to
be
able
swine
of
a
doddering
englishman
who
would
envy
you
trembling
on
your
lean
shanks
whatsoever
you
can
buy
for
yourself
i
spit
on
do
said
coombe
you
are
sputtering
to
such
an
extent
that
you
really
are
you
know
von
hillern
whirled
round
the
corner
coombe
left
alone
stood
still
a
moment
i
was
in
time
he
said
to
himself
feeling
somewhat
nauseated
by
extraordinary
luck
i
was
in
time
in
earlier
days
one
would
have
said
something
about
and
he
at
once
walked
back
chapter
xxiii
it
was
not
utterly
dark
in
the
room
though
robin
after
passing
her
hands
carefully
over
the
walls
had
found
no
electric
buttons
within
reach
nor
any
signs
of
candles
or
matches
elsewhere
the
night
sky
was
clear
and
brilliant
with
many
stars
and
this
gave
her
an
unshadowed
and
lighted
space
to
look
at
she
went
to
the
window
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
huddled
against
the
wall
with
her
hands
clasped
round
her
knees
looking
up
she
did
this
in
the
effort
to
hold
in
check
a
rising
tide
of
frenzy
which
threatened
her
perhaps
if
she
could
fix
her
eyes
on
the
vault
full
of
stars
she
could
keep
herself
from
going
out
of
her
mind
though
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
she
did
go
out
of
her
mind
she
found
herself
thinking
a
few
seconds
later
after
her
first
entire
acceptance
of
the
hideous
thing
which
had
happened
to
her
she
had
passed
through
nerve
breaking
phases
of
imaginings
the
old
story
of
the
drowning
man
across
whose
brain
rush
all
the
images
of
life
came
back
to
her
she
did
not
know
where
or
when
or
how
she
had
ever
heard
or
read
of
the
ghastly
incidents
which
came
trooping
up
to
her
and
staring
at
her
with
dead
or
mad
eyes
and
awful
faces
perhaps
they
were
old
a
kind
of
delirium
had
seized
her
she
tried
to
stop
their
coming
by
saying
over
and
over
again
the
prayers
dowie
had
taught
her
when
she
was
a
child
and
then
she
thought
with
a
sob
which
choked
her
that
perhaps
they
were
only
prayers
for
a
safe
little
creature
kneeling
by
a
white
did
not
apply
to
a
girl
locked
up
in
a
top
room
which
nobody
knew
about
only
when
she
thought
of
mademoiselle
valle
and
dowie
looking
for
her
with
all
london
spread
out
before
their
helplessness
did
she
cry
after
that
tears
seemed
impossible
the
images
trooped
by
too
close
to
her
the
passion
hidden
within
her
being
which
had
broken
out
when
she
tore
the
earth
under
the
shrubbery
and
which
with
torture
staring
her
in
the
face
had
leaped
in
the
child
soul
and
body
and
made
her
defy
andrews
with
shrieks
leaped
up
within
her
now
she
became
a
young
fury
to
whom
a
mad
fight
with
monstrous
death
was
nothing
she
told
herself
that
she
was
strong
for
a
girl
that
she
could
tear
with
her
nails
she
could
clench
her
teeth
in
a
flesh
she
could
shriek
she
could
battle
like
a
young
madwoman
so
that
they
would
be
forced
to
kill
her
this
was
one
of
the
images
which
rose
op
before
her
again
yet
again
a
thing
which
would
not
remain
away
she
had
not
had
any
food
since
the
afternoon
cap
of
tea
and
she
began
to
feel
the
need
of
it
if
she
became
she
lifted
her
face
desperately
as
she
said
it
and
saw
the
immense
blue
darkness
powdered
with
millions
of
stars
and
curving
over
her
as
it
curved
over
the
hideous
house
and
all
the
rest
of
the
world
how
high
how
immense
how
fathomlessly
still
it
was
how
it
seemed
as
if
there
could
be
nothing
else
that
nothing
else
could
be
real
her
hands
were
clenched
together
hard
and
fiercely
as
she
scrambled
to
her
knees
and
uttered
a
of
prayer
not
a
child
rather
the
cry
of
a
young
fury
making
a
demand
perhaps
a
girl
is
nothing
she
cried
girl
locked
up
in
a
room
but
perhaps
she
is
something
she
may
be
real
too
save
me
save
me
but
if
you
wo
save
me
let
me
be
killed
she
knelt
silent
after
it
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
she
sank
down
and
lay
on
the
floor
with
her
face
on
her
arm
how
it
was
possible
that
even
young
and
as
she
was
such
peace
as
sleep
could
overcome
her
at
such
a
time
one
can
not
say
but
in
the
midst
of
her
torment
she
was
asleep
but
it
was
not
for
long
she
wakened
with
a
start
and
sprang
to
her
feet
shivering
the
carriages
were
still
coming
and
going
with
guests
for
the
big
house
opposite
it
could
not
be
late
though
she
seemed
to
have
been
in
the
place
for
years
long
enough
to
feel
that
it
was
the
hideous
centre
of
the
whole
earth
and
all
sane
and
honest
memories
were
a
dream
she
thought
she
would
begin
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
but
a
sound
she
heard
at
this
very
instant
made
her
stand
stock
still
she
had
known
there
would
be
a
sound
at
last
she
had
waited
for
it
all
the
time
she
had
known
of
course
that
it
would
come
but
she
had
not
even
tried
to
guess
whether
she
would
hear
it
early
or
late
it
would
be
the
sound
of
the
turning
of
the
handle
of
the
locked
door
it
had
come
there
it
was
the
click
of
the
lock
first
and
then
the
creak
of
the
turned
handle
she
went
to
the
window
again
and
stood
with
her
back
against
it
so
that
her
body
was
outlined
against
the
faint
light
would
the
person
come
in
the
dark
or
would
he
carry
a
light
something
began
to
whirl
in
her
brain
what
was
the
low
pumping
thump
she
seemed
to
hear
and
feel
at
the
same
time
it
was
the
awful
thumping
of
her
heart
the
door
opened
not
stealthily
but
quite
in
the
ordinary
way
the
person
who
came
in
did
not
move
stealthily
either
he
came
in
as
though
he
were
making
an
evening
call
how
tall
and
straight
his
body
was
with
a
devilish
elegance
of
line
against
the
background
of
light
in
the
hall
she
thought
she
saw
a
white
flower
on
his
lapel
as
his
overcoat
fell
back
the
leering
footman
had
opened
the
for
him
turn
on
the
lights
a
voice
she
knew
gave
the
order
the
leering
footman
obeyed
touching
a
spot
high
on
the
wall
she
had
vaguely
and
sickeningly
felt
almost
sure
that
it
would
be
either
count
von
hillern
or
lord
coombe
and
it
was
not
count
von
hillern
the
cold
wicked
face
the
ironic
eyes
which
made
her
creep
the
absurd
elderly
perfection
of
dress
even
the
flawless
her
flash
quake
with
repulsion
if
satan
came
into
the
room
he
might
look
like
that
and
make
one
revolting
being
quake
so
i
thought
it
might
be
you
the
strange
girl
voice
said
to
him
aloud
robin
he
said
he
was
moving
towards
her
and
as
she
threw
out
her
madly
clenched
little
hands
he
stopped
and
drew
back
why
did
you
think
i
might
come
he
asked
because
you
are
the
kind
of
a
man
who
would
do
the
things
only
devils
would
do
i
have
you
since
i
was
a
baby
come
and
kill
me
if
you
like
call
the
footman
back
to
help
you
if
yon
like
i
ca
get
away
kill
me
kill
me
kill
me
she
was
lost
in
her
frenzy
and
looked
as
if
she
were
mad
one
moment
he
hesitated
and
then
he
pointed
politely
to
the
sofa
go
and
sit
down
please
he
suggested
it
was
no
more
then
a
courteous
suggestion
i
shall
remain
here
i
have
no
desire
to
approach
you
if
you
pardon
my
saying
so
but
she
would
not
leave
the
window
it
is
natural
that
you
should
be
overwrought
he
said
this
is
a
damnable
thing
you
are
too
young
to
know
the
worst
of
it
you
are
the
worst
of
it
she
cried
you
no
as
the
chill
of
his
even
voice
struck
her
she
wondered
if
he
were
really
human
von
hillern
would
have
been
the
worst
of
it
i
stopped
him
at
the
front
door
and
knew
how
to
send
him
away
now
listen
my
good
child
hate
me
as
ferociously
as
you
like
that
is
a
detail
you
are
in
the
house
of
a
woman
whose
name
stands
for
shame
and
infamy
and
crime
what
are
you
doing
in
it
she
cried
again
in
a
place
where
girls
are
locked
up
in
top
rooms
to
be
killed
i
came
to
take
you
away
i
wish
to
do
it
quietly
it
would
be
rather
horrible
if
the
public
discovered
that
you
have
spent
some
hours
here
if
i
had
not
slipped
in
when
they
were
expecting
von
hillern
and
if
the
servants
were
not
accustomed
to
the
quiet
entrance
of
well
dressed
men
i
could
not
have
got
in
without
an
open
row
and
the
calling
of
the
policemen
which
i
wished
to
avoid
also
the
woman
downstairs
knows
me
and
realized
that
i
was
not
lying
when
i
said
the
house
was
surrounded
and
she
was
on
the
point
of
being
in
she
is
a
woman
of
broad
experience
and
at
once
knew
that
she
might
as
well
keep
quiet
despite
his
cold
eyes
and
the
bad
smile
she
hated
despite
his
almost
dandified
meticulous
attire
and
the
festal
note
of
his
white
flower
which
she
hated
with
the
rest
he
was
perhaps
not
lying
to
her
perhaps
for
the
sake
of
her
mother
he
had
chosen
to
save
her
and
being
the
man
he
was
he
had
been
able
to
make
use
of
his
past
experiences
she
began
to
creep
away
from
the
window
and
she
felt
her
legs
all
at
once
shaking
under
her
by
the
time
she
reached
the
chesterfield
sofa
she
fell
down
by
it
and
began
to
cry
a
sort
of
hysteria
seized
her
and
she
shook
from
head
to
foot
and
clutched
at
the
upholstery
with
weak
hands
which
clawed
she
was
indeed
an
awful
piteous
sight
he
was
perhaps
not
lying
but
she
was
afraid
of
him
yet
i
told
the
men
who
are
waiting
outside
that
if
i
did
not
bring
you
out
in
half
an
hour
they
were
to
break
into
the
house
i
do
not
wish
them
to
break
in
we
have
not
any
time
to
spare
what
you
are
doing
is
quite
natural
but
you
must
try
and
get
up
he
stood
by
her
and
said
this
looking
down
at
her
slender
wrung
body
and
lovely
groveling
head
he
took
a
flask
out
of
his
overcoat
pocket
and
it
was
a
gem
of
goldsmith
art
he
poured
some
wine
into
its
cup
and
bent
forward
to
hold
it
out
to
her
drink
this
and
try
to
stand
on
your
feet
he
said
he
knew
better
than
to
try
to
help
her
to
rise
to
touch
her
in
any
way
seeing
to
what
the
past
hours
had
reduced
her
he
knew
better
there
was
mad
fear
in
her
eyes
when
she
lifted
her
head
and
threw
out
her
hand
again
no
no
she
cried
out
no
i
will
drink
nothing
he
understood
at
once
and
threw
the
wine
into
the
grate
i
see
he
said
you
might
think
it
might
be
drugged
you
are
right
it
might
be
i
ought
to
have
thought
of
that
he
returned
the
flask
to
his
pocket
listen
again
you
must
the
time
will
soon
be
up
and
we
must
not
let
those
fellows
break
in
and
make
a
row
that
will
collect
a
crowd
we
must
go
at
once
mademoiselle
valle
is
waiting
for
you
in
my
carriage
outside
you
will
not
be
afraid
to
drink
wine
she
gives
you
mademoiselle
she
stammered
yes
in
my
carriage
which
is
not
fifty
yards
from
the
house
can
you
stand
on
your
feet
she
got
up
and
stood
but
she
was
still
shuddering
all
over
can
you
walk
downstairs
if
you
can
not
will
you
let
me
carry
you
i
am
strong
spite
of
my
years
i
can
walk
she
whispered
will
you
take
my
arm
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
with
awful
eyes
yes
i
will
take
your
arm
he
offered
it
to
her
with
rigid
punctiliousness
of
manner
he
did
not
even
look
at
her
he
led
her
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
three
flights
of
stairs
as
they
passed
by
the
open
door
the
lovely
woman
who
had
called
herself
lady
etynge
stood
near
it
and
watched
them
with
eyes
no
longer
gentle
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
madam
he
said
when
i
place
this
young
lady
in
the
hands
of
her
governess
i
will
come
back
and
say
it
is
her
governess
fraulein
hirsch
asked
the
woman
lightly
no
she
is
doubtless
on
her
way
back
to
berlin
and
von
hillern
will
follow
her
there
was
only
the
first
floor
flight
of
stairs
now
robin
could
scarcely
see
her
way
but
lord
coombe
held
her
up
firmly
and
in
a
few
moments
more
the
leering
footman
grown
pale
opened
the
large
door
they
crossed
the
pavement
to
the
carriage
and
she
was
helped
in
and
fell
almost
insensible
across
mademoiselle
valle
lap
and
was
caught
in
a
strong
arm
which
shook
as
she
did
ma
cherie
she
heard
the
good
god
oh
the
good
good
god
and
lord
coombe
lord
coombe
coombe
had
gone
back
to
the
house
four
men
returned
with
him
two
in
plain
clothes
and
two
policemen
they
remained
below
but
coombe
went
up
the
staircase
with
the
swift
lightness
of
a
man
of
thirty
he
merely
stood
upon
the
threshold
of
the
this
was
what
he
said
and
his
face
was
entirely
white
his
eyes
appalling
my
coming
back
to
speak
to
you
is
superfluous
and
the
result
of
pure
fury
i
allow
it
to
myself
as
mere
shameless
indulgence
more
is
known
against
you
than
this
things
which
have
gone
farther
and
fared
worse
you
are
not
young
and
you
are
facing
years
of
life
in
prison
your
head
will
be
shaved
your
hands
worn
and
blackened
and
your
nails
broken
with
the
picking
of
oakum
you
will
writhe
in
hopeless
degradation
until
you
are
done
for
you
will
have
time
in
the
night
blackness
if
of
your
cell
to
remember
to
see
faces
to
hear
cries
women
such
as
you
should
learn
what
hell
on
earth
means
you
will
learn
when
he
ended
the
woman
hung
with
her
back
to
the
wall
she
had
staggered
against
her
mouth
opening
and
shutting
helplessly
but
letting
forth
no
sound
he
took
out
an
exquisitely
fresh
handkerchief
and
touched
his
forehead
because
it
was
damp
his
eyes
were
still
appalling
but
his
voice
suddenly
dropped
and
changed
i
have
allowed
myself
to
feel
like
a
madman
he
said
it
has
been
a
rich
experience
good
for
such
a
soul
as
i
own
he
went
downstairs
and
walked
home
because
his
carriage
had
taken
robin
and
mademoiselle
back
to
the
slice
of
a
house
chapter
xxiv
von
hillern
made
no
further
calls
on
his
return
to
berlin
was
immediate
and
fraulein
hirsch
came
no
more
to
give
lessons
in
german
later
coombe
learned
from
the
mam
with
the
steady
face
that
she
had
crossed
the
channel
on
a
night
boat
not
many
hours
after
von
hillern
had
walked
away
from
berford
place
the
exact
truth
was
that
she
had
been
miserably
prowling
about
the
adjacent
streets
held
in
the
neighbourhood
by
some
morbidness
half
thwarted
helpless
passion
half
triumphing
hatred
of
the
young
thing
she
had
betrayed
up
and
down
the
streets
she
had
gone
round
and
round
wringing
her
lean
fingers
together
and
tasting
on
her
lips
the
salt
of
tears
which
rolled
down
her
cheeks
tears
of
torment
and
rage
there
was
the
bitterness
of
death
in
what
by
a
mere
trick
of
chance
came
about
as
she
turned
a
corner
telling
herself
for
the
hundredth
time
that
she
must
go
home
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
a
splendid
figure
swinging
furiously
along
she
staggered
at
the
sight
of
the
tigerish
rage
in
the
white
face
she
recognized
with
a
gasp
it
was
enough
merely
to
behold
it
he
had
met
with
some
disastrous
humiliation
as
for
him
the
direct
intervention
of
that
heaven
whose
special
care
he
was
had
sent
him
a
woman
to
punish
which
so
far
was
at
least
one
thing
arranged
as
it
should
be
he
knew
so
well
how
he
could
punish
her
with
his
mere
contempt
and
displeasure
as
he
could
lash
a
spaniel
crawling
at
his
feet
he
need
not
deign
to
tell
her
what
had
happened
and
he
did
not
he
merely
drew
back
and
stood
in
stiff
magnificence
looking
down
at
her
it
is
through
some
folly
of
yours
he
dropped
in
a
voice
of
vitriol
women
are
always
foolish
they
can
not
hold
their
tongues
or
think
clearly
return
to
berlin
at
once
you
are
not
of
those
whose
conduct
i
can
commend
to
be
trusted
in
the
future
he
was
gone
before
she
could
have
spoken
even
if
she
had
dared
sobbing
gasps
caught
her
breath
as
she
stood
and
watched
him
striding
pitilessly
and
superbly
away
with
what
seemed
to
her
abject
soul
the
swing
and
tread
of
a
martial
god
her
streaming
tears
tasted
salt
indeed
she
might
never
see
him
again
even
from
a
distance
she
would
be
disgraced
and
flung
aside
as
a
blundering
woman
she
had
obeyed
his
every
word
and
done
her
straining
best
as
she
had
licked
the
dust
at
his
feet
but
he
would
never
cast
a
glance
at
her
in
the
future
or
utter
to
her
the
remotest
word
of
his
high
commands
she
so
reeled
as
she
went
her
wretched
way
that
a
policeman
said
to
her
as
he
passed
steady
on
my
girl
best
get
home
and
go
to
bed
to
it
was
stated
by
coombe
that
fraulein
hirsch
had
been
called
back
to
germany
by
family
complications
that
august
orders
should
recall
count
von
hillern
was
easily
understood
such
magnificent
persons
never
shone
upon
society
for
any
length
of
time
that
feather
had
been
making
a
country
home
visit
when
her
daughter
had
faced
tragedy
was
considered
by
lord
coombe
as
a
fortunate
thing
we
will
not
alarm
by
telling
her
what
has
occurred
he
said
to
mademoiselle
valle
what
we
most
desire
is
that
no
one
shall
suspect
that
the
hideous
thing
took
place
a
person
who
was
forgetful
or
careless
might
unintentionally
let
some
word
escape
which
what
he
meant
and
what
mademoiselle
valle
knew
he
meant
also
what
he
knew
she
knew
he
meant
was
that
a
woman
who
was
a
heartless
fool
without
sympathy
or
perception
would
not
have
the
delicacy
to
feel
that
the
girl
must
be
shielded
and
might
actually
see
a
sort
of
ghastly
joke
in
a
story
of
mademoiselle
valle
sacrosanct
charge
simply
walking
out
of
her
enshrining
arms
into
such
a
galere
as
the
most
rackety
and
adventurous
of
pupils
could
scarcely
have
been
led
into
such
a
point
of
view
would
have
been
quite
possible
for
feather
even
probable
in
the
slightly
spiteful
attitude
of
her
light
mind
she
was
away
from
home
only
you
and
i
and
dowie
know
answered
mademoiselle
let
us
remain
the
only
persons
who
know
said
coombe
robin
will
say
nothing
they
both
knew
that
she
had
been
feverish
and
ill
for
several
days
and
dowie
had
kept
her
in
bed
saying
that
she
had
caught
cold
neither
of
the
two
women
had
felt
it
possible
to
talk
to
her
she
had
lain
staring
with
a
deadly
quiet
fixedness
straight
before
her
saying
next
to
nothing
now
and
then
she
shuddered
and
once
she
broke
into
a
mad
fit
of
crying
which
she
seemed
unable
to
control
everything
is
changed
she
said
to
dowie
and
mademoiselle
who
sat
on
either
side
of
her
bed
sometimes
pressing
her
head
down
onto
a
kind
shoulder
sometimes
holding
her
hand
and
patting
it
i
shall
be
afraid
of
everybody
forever
people
who
have
sweet
faces
and
kind
voices
will
make
me
shake
all
over
oh
she
seemed
so
kind
so
kind
it
was
dowie
whose
warm
shoulder
her
face
hidden
on
this
time
and
dowie
was
choked
with
sobs
she
dared
not
let
loose
she
could
only
squeeze
hard
and
kiss
the
silk
curls
all
in
a
heap
poor
tumbled
curls
no
longer
a
child
aye
my
lamb
she
managed
to
say
dowie
poor
pet
lamb
it
the
knowing
that
kind
eyes
kind
ones
she
broke
off
panting
it
the
knowing
i
did
know
before
i
knew
nothing
now
it
all
over
i
afraid
of
all
the
world
not
all
cherie
breathed
mademoiselle
she
sat
upright
against
her
pillows
the
mirror
on
a
dressing
table
reflected
her
image
her
blooming
youth
framed
in
the
wonderful
hair
falling
a
shadow
about
her
she
stared
at
the
reflection
hard
and
questioningly
i
suppose
her
voice
was
pathos
itself
in
its
helplessness
it
is
because
what
you
once
told
me
about
being
pretty
is
true
a
girl
who
looks
like
that
pointing
her
finger
at
the
glass
need
not
think
she
can
earn
her
own
living
i
loathe
it
in
fierce
resentment
at
some
bitter
injustice
it
is
like
being
a
person
under
a
curse
at
this
dowie
broke
down
openly
and
let
her
tears
run
fast
no
no
you
must
say
it
or
think
it
my
dearie
she
wept
it
might
call
down
a
blight
on
it
you
a
young
thing
like
a
garden
flower
and
someone
somewhere
god
bless
him
that
some
glory
in
it
and
you
glory
too
somewhere
he
is
somewhere
let
none
of
them
look
at
me
cried
robin
i
loather
them
too
i
hate
everything
and
everybody
but
you
two
just
you
two
mademoiselle
took
her
in
her
arms
this
time
when
she
sobbed
again
mademoiselle
knew
how
at
this
hour
it
seemed
to
her
that
all
her
world
was
laid
bare
forever
more
when
the
worst
of
the
weeping
was
over
and
she
lay
quiet
but
for
the
deep
catching
breaths
which
lifted
her
breast
in
slow
childish
shudders
at
intervals
she
held
mademoiselle
valle
hand
and
looked
at
her
with
a
faint
wry
smile
you
were
too
kind
to
tell
me
what
a
stupid
little
fool
i
was
when
i
talked
to
you
about
taking
a
place
in
an
office
she
said
i
know
now
that
you
would
not
have
allowed
me
to
do
the
things
i
was
so
sure
i
could
do
it
was
only
my
ignorance
and
conceit
i
ca
answer
advertisements
any
bad
person
can
say
what
they
choose
in
an
advertisement
if
that
woman
had
advertised
she
would
have
described
helene
and
there
was
no
helene
one
of
the
shuddering
catches
of
her
breath
broke
in
here
after
it
she
said
with
a
pitiful
girlishness
of
regret
i
i
could
see
helene
i
have
known
so
few
people
well
enough
to
love
them
no
girls
at
all
i
though
perhaps
we
should
begin
to
love
each
other
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
that
that
she
never
was
alive
at
all
it
leaves
a
sort
of
empty
place
when
she
had
sufficiently
recovered
herself
to
be
up
again
mademoiselle
valle
said
to
her
that
she
wished
her
to
express
her
gratitude
to
lord
coombe
i
will
if
you
wish
it
she
answered
do
you
feel
that
it
is
proper
that
you
should
do
it
do
you
not
wish
it
yourself
inquired
mademoiselle
robin
looked
down
at
the
carpet
for
some
seconds
i
know
she
at
last
admitted
that
it
is
proper
but
i
wish
to
do
it
no
said
mademoiselle
valle
robin
raised
her
eyes
from
the
carpet
and
fixed
them
on
her
it
is
because
of
reasons
she
said
it
is
part
of
the
horror
i
want
to
forget
even
you
may
know
what
it
has
done
to
me
perhaps
i
am
turning
into
a
girl
with
a
bad
mind
bad
thoughts
keep
swooping
down
on
me
like
great
black
ravens
lord
coombe
saved
me
but
i
think
hideous
things
about
him
i
heard
andrews
say
he
was
bad
when
i
was
too
little
to
know
what
it
meant
now
i
know
i
remember
that
he
knew
because
he
chose
to
know
of
his
own
free
will
he
knew
that
woman
and
she
knew
him
how
did
he
know
her
she
took
a
forward
step
which
brought
her
nearer
to
mademoiselle
i
never
told
you
but
i
will
tell
you
now
she
confessed
when
the
door
opened
and
i
saw
him
standing
against
the
light
i
i
did
not
think
he
had
come
to
save
me
mon
dieu
breathed
mademoiselle
in
soft
horror
he
knows
i
am
pretty
he
is
an
old
man
but
he
knows
fraulein
hirsch
once
made
me
feel
actually
sick
by
telling
me
in
her
meek
sly
careful
way
that
he
liked
beautiful
girls
and
the
people
said
he
wanted
a
young
wife
and
had
his
eye
on
me
i
was
rude
to
her
because
it
made
me
so
furious
how
did
he
know
that
woman
so
well
you
see
how
bad
i
have
been
made
he
knows
nearly
all
europe
he
has
seen
the
dark
corners
as
well
as
the
bright
places
perhaps
he
has
saved
other
girls
from
her
he
brought
her
to
punishment
and
was
able
to
do
it
because
he
has
been
on
her
track
for
some
time
you
are
not
bad
but
unjust
you
have
had
too
great
a
shock
to
be
able
to
reason
sanely
just
yet
i
think
he
will
always
make
me
creep
a
little
said
robin
but
i
will
say
anything
you
think
i
ought
to
say
on
an
occasion
when
feather
had
gone
again
to
make
a
visit
in
the
country
mademoiselle
came
into
the
sitting
room
with
the
round
window
in
which
plants
grew
and
coombe
followed
her
robin
looked
up
from
her
book
with
a
little
start
and
then
stood
up
i
have
told
lord
coombe
that
you
wish
that
i
wish
you
to
thank
him
mademoiselle
valle
said
i
came
on
my
own
part
to
tell
you
that
any
expression
of
gratitude
is
entirely
unnecessary
said
coombe
i
must
be
grateful
i
am
grateful
robin
colour
slowly
faded
as
she
said
it
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
seen
him
since
he
had
supported
her
down
the
staircase
which
mounted
to
a
place
of
hell
there
is
nothing
to
which
i
should
object
so
much
as
being
regarded
as
a
benefactor
he
answered
definitely
but
with
entire
lack
of
warmth
the
role
does
not
suit
me
being
an
extremely
bad
man
he
said
it
as
one
who
speaks
wholly
without
prejudice
my
experience
is
wide
i
chance
to
know
things
the
woman
who
called
herself
lady
etynge
is
of
a
class
which
which
does
not
count
me
among
its
clients
i
had
put
certain
authorities
on
her
track
which
was
how
i
discovered
your
whereabouts
when
mademoiselle
valle
told
me
that
you
had
gone
to
take
tea
with
her
mere
chance
you
see
do
be
grateful
to
me
i
beg
of
you
but
to
mademoiselle
valle
why
faltered
robin
vaguely
repelled
as
much
as
ever
did
it
matter
to
you
because
he
answered
oh
the
cold
inhumanness
of
his
gray
eye
you
happened
to
live
in
this
house
i
thought
that
was
perhaps
the
reason
she
said
and
she
felt
that
he
made
her
creep
even
a
shade
more
i
beg
your
pardon
she
added
suddenly
remembering
please
sit
down
thank
you
as
he
sat
i
will
because
i
have
something
more
to
say
to
you
robin
and
mademoiselle
seated
themselves
also
and
listened
there
are
many
hideous
aspects
of
existence
which
are
not
considered
necessary
portions
of
a
girl
education
he
began
they
ought
to
be
put
in
robin
and
her
voice
was
as
hard
as
it
was
young
it
was
a
long
and
penetrating
look
he
gave
her
i
am
not
an
instructor
of
youth
i
have
not
been
called
upon
to
decide
i
do
not
feel
it
my
duty
to
go
even
now
into
detail
you
need
not
broke
in
the
hard
young
voice
i
know
everything
in
the
world
i
black
with
knowing
mademoiselle
will
discuss
that
point
with
you
what
you
have
unfortunately
been
forced
to
learn
is
that
it
is
not
safe
for
a
girl
even
a
girl
without
beauty
to
act
independently
of
older
people
unless
she
has
found
out
how
to
guard
herself
against
devils
the
words
broke
from
him
sharply
with
a
sudden
incongruous
hint
of
ferocity
which
was
almost
startling
you
have
been
frightened
he
said
next
and
you
have
discovered
that
there
are
devils
but
you
have
not
sufficient
experience
to
guard
yourself
against
them
i
have
been
so
frightened
that
i
shall
be
a
coward
a
coward
all
my
life
i
shall
be
afraid
of
every
face
i
see
the
more
to
be
trusted
they
look
the
more
i
shall
fear
them
i
hate
every
one
in
the
world
her
quite
wonderful
eyes
so
they
struck
lord
coombe
flamed
with
a
child
outraged
anguish
a
thunder
shower
of
tears
broke
and
rushed
down
her
cheeks
and
he
rose
and
walking
quietly
to
the
window
full
of
flowers
stood
with
his
back
to
her
for
a
few
moments
she
neither
cared
nor
knew
whether
it
was
because
her
hysteric
emotion
bored
or
annoyed
him
or
because
he
had
the
taste
to
realize
that
she
would
not
wish
to
be
looked
at

feel
no
law
but
its
own
but
all
was
over
during
the
few
moments
and
he
turned
and
walked

to
his
chair
you
want
very
much
to
do
some
work
which
will
insure
your
entire
independence
to
take
some
situation
which
will
support
you
without
aid
from
others
you
are
not
yet
prepared
to
go
out
and
take
the
first
place
which
offers
you
have
been
as
you
say
too
hideously
frightened
and
you
know
there
are
dangers
in
wandering
about
unguided
mademoiselle
valle
turning
his
head
perhaps
you
will
tell
her
what
you
know
of
the
duchess
of
darte
upon
which
mademoiselle
valle
took
hold
of
her
hand
and
entered
into
a
careful
explanation
she
is
a
great
personage
of
whom
there
can
be
no
doubt
she
was
a
lady
of
the
court
she
is
of
advanced
years
and
an
invalid
and
has
a
liking
for
those
who
are
pretty
and
young
she
desires
a
companion
who
is
well
educated
and
young
and
fresh
of
mind
the
companion
who
had
been
with
her
for
many
years
recently
died
if
you
took
her
place
you
would
live
with
her
in
her
town
house
and
go
with
her
to
the
country
after
the
season
your
salary
would
be
liberal
and
no
position
could
be
more
protected
and
dignified
i
have
seen
and
talked
to
her
grace
myself
and
she
will
allow
me
to
take
you
to
her
if
you
desire
to
go
do
not
permit
the
fact
that
she
has
known
me
for
many
years
to
prejudice
you
against
the
proposal
said
coombe
you
might
perhaps
regard
it
rather
as
a
sort
of
guarantee
of
my
conduct
in
the
matter
she
knows
the
worst
of
me
and
still
allows
me
to
retain
her
acquaintance
she
was
brilliant
and
full
of
charm
when
she
was
a
young
woman
and
she
is
even
more
so
now
because
she
is
of
a
rarity
if
i
were
a
girl
and
might
earn
my
living
in
her
service
i
should
feel
that
fortune
had
been
good
to
me
good
robin
eyes
turned
from
one
of
them
to
the
other
from
coombe
to
mademoiselle
valle
and
from
mademoiselle
to
coombe
pathetically
you
you
see
what
has
been
done
to
me
she
said
a
few
weeks
ago
i
should
have
known
that
god
was
providing
for
me
taking
care
of
me
and
now
i
am
still
afraid
i
feel
as
if
she
would
see
that
that
i
am
not
young
and
fresh
any
more
but
black
with
evil
i
am
afraid
of
her
i
am
afraid
of
you
to
coombe
and
of
myself
coombe
rose
evidently
to
go
away
but
you
are
not
afraid
of
mademoiselle
valle
he
put
it
to
her
she
will
provide
the
necessary
references
for
the
duchess
i
will
leave
her
to
help
you
to
decide
robin
rose
also
she
wondered
if
she
ought
not
to
hold
out
her
hand
perhaps
he
saw
her
slight
movement
he
himself
made
none
i
remember
you
objected
to
shaking
hands
as
a
child
he
said
with
an
impersonal
civil
smile
and
the
easy
punctiliousness
of
his
bow
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
go

chapter
xxv
some
days
before
this
the
duchess
of
darte
had
driven
out
in
the
morning
to
make
some
purchases
and
as
she
had
sat
in
her
large
landau
she
had
greatly
missed
miss
brent
who
had
always
gone
with
her
when
she
had
made
necessary
visits
to
the
shops
she
was
not
fond
of
shopping
and
miss
brent
had
privately
found
pleasure
in
it
which
had
made
her
a
cheerful
companion
to
the
quiet
elderly
woman
whose
life
previous
to
her
service
with
this
great
lady
had
been
spent
in
struggles
with
poverty
the
mere
incident
of
entering
shops
and
finding
eager
salesmen
springing
forward
to
meet
her
with
bows
and
amiable
offers
of
ministration
was
to
the
end
of
her
days
an
almost
thrilling
thing
the
duchess
bought
splendidly
though
quietly
knowing
always
what
she
wanted
she
merely
required
that
it
be
produced
and
after
silently
examining
it
gave
orders
that
it
should
be
sent
to
her
there
was
a
dignity
in
her
decision
which
was
impressive
she
never
gave
trouble
or
hesitated
the
staffs
of
employees
in
the
large
shops
knew
and
reveled
in
her
while
they
figuratively
bent
the
knee
miss
brent
had
been
a
happy
satisfied
woman
while
she
had
lived
she
had
died
peacefully
after
a
brief
and
as
it
seemed
at
first
unalarming
illness
at
one
of
her
employer
country
houses
to
which
she
had
been
amiably
sent
down
for
a
holiday
every
kindness
and
attention
had
been
bestowed
upon
her
and
only
a
few
moments
before
she
fell
into
her
last
sleep
she
had
been
talking
pleasantly
of
her
mistress
she
is
a
very
great
lady
miss
hallam
she
had
said
to
her
nurse
she
the
last
of
her
kind
i
often
think
very
great
ladies
seem
to
have
gone
out
if
you
know
what
i
mean
they
gone
out
the
duchess
had
in
fact
said
of
brent
as
she
stood
a
few
days
later
beside
her
coffin
and
looked
down
at
her
contentedly
serene
face
something
not
unlike
what
brent
had
said
of
herself
you
were
a
good
friend
brent
my
dear
she
murmured
i
shall
always
miss
you
i
am
afraid
there
are
no
more
like
you
left
she
was
thinking
of
her
all
the
morning
as
she
drove
slowly
down
to
bond
street
and
piccadilly
as
she
got
out
of
her
carriage
to
go
into
a
shop
she
was
attracted
by
some
photographs
of
beauties
in
a
window
and
paused
to
glance
at
them
many
of
them
were
beauties
whom
she
knew
but
among
them
were
some
of
society
latest
discoveries
the
particular
photographs
which
caught
her
eye
were
two
which
had
evidently
been
purposely
placed
side
by
side
for
an
interesting
reason
the
reason
was
that
the
two
women
while
obviously
belonging
to
periods
of
some
twenty
years
apart
as
the
fashion
of
their
dress
proved
were
in
face
and
form
so
singularly
alike
that
they
bewilderingly
suggested
that
they
were
the
same
person
both
were
exquisitely
nymphlike
fair
and
large
eyed
and
both
had
the
fine
light
hair
which
is
capable
of
forming
itself
into
a
halo
the
duchess
stood
and
looked
at
them
for
the
moment
she
slightly
caught
her
breath
she
was
borne
back
so
swiftly
and
so
far
her
errand
in
the
next
door
shop
was
forgotten
she
went
into
the
one
which
displayed
the
photographs
i
wish
to
look
at
the
two
photographs
which
are
so
much
alike
she
said
to
the
man
behind
the
counter
he
knew
her
as
most
people
did
and
brought
forth
the
photographs
at
once
many
people
are
interested
in
them
your
grace
he
said
it
was
the
amazing
likeness
which
made
me
put
them
beside
each
other
yes
she
answered
it
is
almost
incredible
she
looked
up
from
the
beautiful
young
being
dressed
in
the
mode
of
twenty
years
past
this
is
was
she
corrected
herself
and
paused
the
man
replied
in
a
somewhat
dropped
voice
he
evidently
had
his
reasons
for
feeling
it
discreet
to
do
so
yes
was
she
died
twenty
years
ago
the
young
princess
alixe
of
x
he
said
there
was
a
sad
story
your
grace
no
doubt
remembers
it
was
a
good
deal
talked
about
yes
she
replied
and
said
no
more
but
took
up
the
modern
picture
it
displayed
the
same
almost
floating
airiness
of
type
but
in
this
case
the
original
wore
diaphanous
wisps
of
spangled
tulle
threatening
to
take
wings
and
fly
away
leaving
the
girl
slimness
of
arms
and
shoulders
bereft
of
any
covering
whatsoever
this
one
is
she
questioned
a
a
widow
with
a
daughter
though
she
looks
in
her
teens
she
older
than
the
princess
was
but
she
kept
her
beauty
as
ladies
know
how
to
in
these
days
it
wonderful
to
see
them
side
by
side
but
it
only
a
few
that
saw
her
highness
as
she
was
the
season
she
came
with
the
prince
to
visit
at
windsor
in
queen
victoria
day
did
your
grace
he
checked
himself
feeling
that
he
was
perhaps
somewhat
exceeding
bond
street
limits
yes
i
saw
her
said
the
duchess
if
these
are
for
sale
i
will
take
them
both
i
selling
a
good
many
of
them
people
buy
them
because
the
likeness
makes
them
a
sort
of
curiosity
is
a
very
modern
lady
and
she
is
quite
amused
the
duchess
took
the
two
photographs
home
with
her
and
looked
at
them
a
great
deal
afterwards
as
she
sat
in
her
winged
chair
they
were
on
her
table
when
coombe
came
to
drink
tea
with
her
in
the
afternoon
when
he
saw
them
he
stood
still
and
studied
the
two
faces
silently
for
several
seconds
did
you
ever
see
a
likeness
so
wonderful
he
said
at
last
never
she
answered
or
an
unlikeness
that
is
the
most
wonderful
of
all
the
unlikeness
it
is
the
same
body
inhabited
by
two
souls
from
different
spheres
his
next
words
were
spoken
very
slowly
i
should
have
been
sure
you
would
see
that
he
commented
i
lost
my
breath
for
a
second
when
i
saw
them
side
by
side
in
the
shop
window
and
the
next
moment
i
lost
it
again
because
i
saw
what
i
speak
of
the
utter
world
wide
apartness
it
is
in
their
eyes
she
she
touched
the
silver
frame
enclosing
the
young
princess
was
a
little
saint
a
little
spirit
there
never
was
a
young
human
thing
so
transparently
pure
the
rigid
modeling
of
his
face
expressed
a
thing
which
himself
recognizing
its
presence
he
chose
to
turn
aside
as
he
moved
towards
the
mantel
and
leaned
on
it
the
same
thing
caused
his
voice
to
sound
hoarse
and
low
as
he
spoke
in
answer
saying
something
she
had
not
expected
him
to
say
its
unexpectedness
in
fact
produced
in
her
an
effect
of
shock
and
she
was
the
possession
of
a
brute
incarnate
mad
with
unbridled
lust
and
drink
and
abnormal
furies
she
was
a
child
saint
and
shook
with
terror
before
him
he
killed
her
i
believe
he
did
she
said
unsteadily
after
a
breath
space
of
pause
many
people
believed
so
though
great
effort
was
made
to
silence
the
stories
but
there
were
too
many
stories
and
they
were
so
unspeakable
that
even
those
in
high
places
were
made
furiously
indignant
he
was
not
received
here
at
court
afterwards
his
own
emperor
could
not
condone
what
he
did
public
opinion
was
too
strong
the
stories
were
true
answered
the
hoarse
low
voice
i
myself
by
royal
command
was
a
guest
at
the
schloss
in
the
bavarian
alps
when
it
was
known
that
he
struck
her
repeatedly
with
a
dog
whip
she
was
going
to
have
a
child
one
night
i
was
wandering
in
the
park
in
misery
and
i
heard
shrieks
which
sent
me
in
mad
search
i
do
not
know
what
i
should
have
done
if
i
had
succeeded
but
i
tried
to
force
an
entrance
into
the
wing
from
which
the
shrieks
came
i
was
met
and
stopped
almost
by
open
violence
the
sounds
ceased
she
died
a
week
later
but
the
most
experienced
lying
could
not
hide
some
things
even
royal
menials
may
have
human
blood
in
their
veins
it
was
known
that
there
were
hideous
marks
on
her
little
dead
body
we
heard
we
heard
whispered
the
duchess
he
killed
her
but
she
would
have
died
of
horror
if
he
had
not
struck
her
a
blow
she
began
to
die
from
the
hour
the
marriage
was
forced
upon
her
i
saw
that
when
she
was
with
him
at
windsor
you
were
in
attendance
on
him
the
duchess
said
after
a
little
silence
that
was
when
i
first
knew
you
yes
she
had
added
the
last
sentence
gravely
and
his
reply
was
as
grave
though
his
voice
was
still
hoarse
you
were
sublime
goodness
and
wisdom
when
a
woman
through
the
sheer
quality
of
her
silence
saves
a
man
from
slipping
over
the
verge
of
madness
he
does
not
forget
while
i
was
sane
i
dared
scarcely
utter
her
name
if
i
had
gone
mad
i
should
have
raved
as
madmen
do
for
that
reason
i
was
afraid
i
knew
speech
was
the
greatest
danger
she
answered
him
she
was
a
princess
of
a
royal
house
poor
little
angel
and
she
had
a
husband
whose
vileness
and
violence
all
europe
knew
how
dared
they
give
her
to
him
for
reasons
of
their
own
and
because
she
was
too
humbly
innocent
and
obedient
to
rebel
the
duchess
did
not
ask
questions
the
sublime
goodness
of
which
he
had
spoken
had
revealed
its
perfection
through
the
fact
that
in
the
long
past
days
she
had
neither
questioned
nor
commented
she
had
given
her
strong
soul
secret
support
to
him
and
in
his
unbearable
hours
he
had
known
that
when
he
came
to
her
for
refuge
while
she
understood
his
need
to
the
uttermost
she
would
speak
no
word
even
to
himself
but
today
though
she
asked
no
question
her
eyes
waited
upon
him
as
it
were
this
was
because
she
saw
that
for
some
unknown
reason
a
heavy
veil
had
rolled
back
from
the
past
he
had
chosen
to
keep
hidden
even
from
himself
as
it
were
more
than
from
others
speech
is
always
the
most
dangerous
thing
he
said
only
the
silence
of
years
piled
one
upon
the
other
will
bury
unendurable
things
even
thought
must
be
silenced
i
have
lived
a
lifetime
since
his
words
began
to
come
very
slowly
as
she
listened
she
felt
as
if
he
were
opening
a
grave
and
drawing
from
its
depths
long
buried
things
since
the
night
when
i
met
her
alone
in
a
wood
in
the
park
of
the
schloss
and
lost
hold
of
myself
lost
it
utterly
the
duchess
withered
hands
caught
each
other
in
a
clasp
which
was
almost
like
a
passionate
exclamation
there
was
such
a
night
and
i
was
young
young
not
an
iron
bound
vieillard
then
when
one
is
young
one
anguish
is
the
deluge
which
ends
the
world
forever
i
had
lain
down
and
risen
up
and
spent
every
hour
in
growing
torture
for
months
i
had
been
forced
to
bind
myself
down
with
bands
of
iron
when
i
found
myself
without
warning
face
to
face
with
her
alone
in
the
night
stillness
of
the
wood
the
bands
broke
she
had
dared
to
creep
out
in
secret
to
hide
herself
and
her
heartbroken
terror
in
the
silence
and
darkness
alone
i
knew
it
without
being
told
i
knew
and
i
went
quite
mad
for
the
time
i
was
only
a
boy
i
threw
myself
face
downward
on
the
earth
and
sobbed
embracing
her
young
feet
both
of
them
were
quite
silent
for
a
few
moments
before
he
went
on
she
was
not
afraid
he
said
even
with
something
which
was
like
a
curious
smile
of
tender
pity
at
the
memory
afterwards
when
i
stood
near
her
trembling
she
even
took
my
hand
and
held
it
once
she
kissed
it
humbly
like
a
little
child
while
her
tears
rained
down
never
before
was
there
anything
as
innocently
heartbreaking
she
was
so
piteously
grateful
for
love
of
any
kind
and
so
heart
wrung
by
my
misery
he
paused
again
and
looked
down
at
the
carpet
thinking
then
he
looked
up
at
her
directly
i
need
not
explain
to
you
you
will
know
i
was
my
heart
was
pounding
in
my
side
my
blood
thudded
through
my
veins
every
atom
of
natural
generous
manhood
in
my
being
was
wild
with
fury
at
the
brutal
wrong
done
her
exquisiteness
and
she
she
was
a
young
novice
fresh
from
a
convent
and
very
pious
the
duchess
quiet
voice
put
in
you
understand
he
answered
she
knelt
down
and
prayed
for
her
own
soul
as
well
as
mine
she
thanked
god
that
i
was
kind
and
would
forgive
her
and
go
away
and
only
remember
her
in
my
prayers
she
believed
it
was
possible
it
was
not
but
i
kissed
the
hem
of
her
white
dress
and
left
her
standing
alone
a
little
saint
in
a
woodland
shrine
that
was
what
i
thought
deliriously
as
i
staggered
off
it
was
the
next
night
that
i
heard
her
shrieks
then
she
died
the
duchess
knew
what
else
had
died
the
high
adventure
of
youth
and
joy
of
life
in
him
the
brilliant
spirit
which
had
been
himself
and
whose
utter
withdrawal
from
his
being
had
left
him
as
she
had
seen
him
on
his
return
to
london
in
those
days
which
now
seemed
a
memory
of
a
past
life
in
a
world
which
had
passed
also
he
had
appeared
before
her
late
one
afternoon
and
she
had
for
a
moment
been
afraid
to
look
at
him
because
she
was
struck
to
the
depths
of
her
being
by
a
sense
of
seeing
before
her
a
body
which
had
broken
the
link
holding
it
to
life
and
walked
the
earth
the
crowded
streets
the
ordinary
rooms
where
people
gathered
a
dead
thing
even
while
it
moved
it
gazed
out
of
dead
eyes
and
the
years
had
passed
and
though
they
had
been
friends
he
had
never
spoken
until
now
such
a
thing
must
be
buried
in
a
tomb
covered
with
a
heavy
stone
and
with
a
seal
set
upon
it
i
am
unsealing
a
tomb
he
said
then
after
a
silence
he
added
i
have
of
cause
a
reason
she
bent
her
head
because
she
had
known
this
must
be
the
case
there
is
a
thing
i
wish
you
to
understand
every
woman
could
not
i
shall
understand
because
i
know
you
will
i
need
not
enter
into
exact
detail
you
will
not
find
what
i
say
abnormal
there
had
been
several
pauses
during
his
relation
once
or
twice
he
had
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
as
if
for
calmer
breath
or
to
draw
himself
back
from
a
past
which
had
suddenly
become
again
a
present
of
torment
too
great
to
face
with
modern
steadiness
he
took
breath
so
to
speak
in
this
manner
again
the
years
pass
the
agony
of
being
young
passes
one
slowly
becomes
another
man
he
resumed
i
am
another
man
i
could
not
be
called
a
creature
of
sentiment
i
have
given
myself
interests
in
existence
many
of
them
but
the
sealed
tomb
is
under
one
feet
not
to
allow
oneself
to
acknowledge
its
existence
consciously
is
one
affair
but
the
devil
of
chance
sometimes
chooses
to
play
tricks
such
a
trick
was
played
on
me
he
glanced
down
at
the
two
pictures
at
which
she
herself
was
looking
with
grave
eyes
it
was
the
photograph
of
feather
he
took
up
and
set
a
strange
questioning
gaze
upon
when
i
saw
this
he
said
this
exquisitely
smiling
at
me
under
a
green
tree
in
a
sunny
garden
the
tomb
opened
under
my
feet
and
i
stood
on
the
brink
of
it
again
you
can
not
possibly
put
it
into
words
the
duchess
said
you
need
not
i
know
for
he
had
become
for
the
moment
almost
livid
even
to
her
who
so
well
knew
him
it
was
a
singular
thing
to
see
him
hastily
set
down
the
picture
and
touch
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
she
knew
he
was
about
to
tell
her
his
reason
for
this
unsealing
of
the
tomb
when
he
sat
down
at
her
table
he
did
so
he
did
not
use
many
phrases
but
in
making
clear
his
reasons
he
also
made
clear
to
her
certain
facts
which
most
persons
would
have
ironically
disbelieved
but
no
shadow
of
a
doubt
passed
through
her
mind
because
she
had
through
a
long
life
dwelt
interestedly
on
the
many
variations
in
human
type
she
was
extraordinarily
interested
when
he
ended
with
the
story
of
robin
i
do
not
know
exactly
why
matters
to
me
i
am
quoting
her
mother
he
explained
but
it
happens
that
i
am
determined
to
stand
between
the
child
and
what
would
otherwise
be
the
inevitable
it
is
not
that
she
has
the
slightest
resemblance
to
to
anyone
which
might
awaken
memory
it
is
not
that
she
and
her
mother
are
of
totally
different
types
and
her
detestation
of
me
is
unconquerable
she
believes
me
to
be
the
worst
of
men
when
i
entered
the
room
into
which
the
woman
had
trapped
her
she
thought
that
i
came
as
one
of
the
creature
damnable
clients
you
will
acknowledge
that
my
position
presents
difficulties
in
the
way
of
explanation
to
a
girl
to
most
adults
in
fact
her
childish
frenzy
of
desire
to
support
herself
arises
from
her
loathing
of
the
position
of
accepting
support
from
me
i
sympathize
with
her
entirely
mademoiselle
valle
is
an
intelligent
woman
the
duchess
said
as
though
thinking
the
matter
out
send
her
to
me
and
we
will
talk
the
matter
over
then
she
can
bring
the
child
chapter
xxvi
as
a
result
of
this
her
grace
saw
mademoiselle
valle
alone
a
few
mornings
later
and
talked
to
her
long
and
quietly
their
comprehension
of
each
other
was
complete
before
their
interview
was
at
an
end
the
duchess
interest
in
the
adventure
she
was
about
to
enter
into
had
become
profound
the
sooner
she
is
surrounded
by
a
new
atmosphere
the
better
was
one
of
the
things
the
frenchwoman
had
said
the
prospect
of
an
arrangement
so
perfect
and
so
secure
fills
me
with
the
profoundest
gratitude
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
return
to
my
parents
in
belgium
they
are
old
and
failing
in
health
and
need
me
greatly
i
have
been
sad
and
anxious
for
months
because
i
felt
that
it
would
be
wickedness
to
desert
this
poor
child
i
have
been
torn
in
two
now
i
can
be
at
peace
thank
the
good
god
bring
her
to
me
tomorrow
if
possible
the
duchess
said
when
they
parted
i
foresee
that
i
may
have
something
to
overcome
in
the
fact
that
i
am
lord
coombe
old
friend
but
i
hope
to
be
able
to
overcome
it
she
is
a
baby
she
is
of
great
beauty
she
has
a
passionate
little
soul
of
which
she
knows
nothing
mademoiselle
valle
said
it
with
an
anxious
reflectiveness
i
have
been
afraid
if
i
were
her
mother
her
eyes
sought
those
of
the
older
woman
but
she
has
no
mother
her
grace
answered
her
own
eyes
were
serious
she
knew
something
of
girls
of
young
things
of
the
rush
and
tumult
of
young
life
in
them
and
of
the
outlet
it
demanded
a
baby
who
was
of
great
beauty
and
of
a
passionate
soul
was
no
trivial
undertaking
for
a
rheumatic
old
duchess
but
bring
her
to
me
she
said
so
was
robin
brought
to
the
tall
early
victorian
mansion
in
the
belatedly
stately
square
and
the
chief
thought
in
her
mind
was
that
though
mere
good
manners
demanded
under
the
circumstances
that
she
should
come
to
see
the
dowager
duchess
of
darte
and
be
seen
by
her
if
she
found
that
she
was
like
lord
coombe
she
would
not
be
able
to
endure
the
prospect
of
a
future
spent
in
her
service
howsoever
desirable
such
service
might
outwardly
appear
this
desirableness
mademoiselle
valle
had
made
clear
to
her
she
was
to
be
the
companion
of
a
personage
of
great
and
mature
charm
and
grace
who
desired
not
mere
attendance
but
something
more
which
something
included
the
warmth
and
fresh
brightness
of
happy
youth
and
bloom
she
would
do
for
her
employer
the
things
a
young
relative
might
do
she
would
have
a
suite
of
rooms
of
her
own
and
a
freedom
as
to
hours
and
actions
which
greater
experience
on
her
part
would
have
taught
was
not
the
customary
portion
meted
out
to
a
paid
companion
but
she
knew
nothing
of
paid
service
and
a
preliminary
talk
of
coombe
with
mademoiselle
valle
had
warned
her
against
allowing
any
suspicion
that
this
earning
a
living
had
been
too
obviously
ameliorated
her
life
is
unusual
she
herself
is
unusual
in
a
most
dignified
and
beautiful
way
you
will
it
might
almost
be
said
hold
the
position
of
a
young
lady
in
waiting
was
mademoiselle
gracefully
put
explanation
when
after
they
had
been
ushered
into
the
room
where
her
grace
sat
in
her
beautiful
and
mellow
corner
by
the
fire
robin
advanced
towards
the
highbacked
chair
what
the
old
woman
was
chiefly
conscious
of
was
the
eyes
which
seemed
all
lustrous
iris
there
was
uncommon
appeal
and
fear
in
them
the
blackness
of
their
setting
of
lashes
made
them
look
babyishly
wide
mademoiselle
valle
has
told
me
of
your
wish
to
take
a
position
as
companion
the
duchess
said
after
they
were
seated
i
want
very
much
said
robin
to
support
myself
and
mademoiselle
thinks
that
i
might
fill
such
a
place
if
i
am
not
considered
too
young
you
are
not
too
young
for
me
i
want
something
young
to
come
and
befriend
me
am
i
too
old
for
you
her
smile
had
been
celebrated
fifty
years
earlier
and
it
had
not
changed
a
smile
does
not
she
was
not
like
lord
coombe
in
any
degree
however
remote
she
did
not
belong
to
his
world
robin
thought
if
i
can
do
well
enough
the
things
you
require
done
she
answered
blushing
her
jacqueminot
rose
blush
i
shall
be
grateful
if
you
will
let
me
try
to
do
them
mademoiselle
will
tell
you
that
i
have
no
experience
but
that
i
am
one
who
tries
well
mademoiselle
has
answered
all
my
questions
concerning
your
qualifications
so
satisfactorily
that
i
need
ask
you
very
few
such
questions
as
she
asked
were
not
of
the
order
robin
had
expected
she
led
her
into
talk
and
drew
mademoiselle
valle
into
the
conversation
it
was
talk
which
included
personal
views
of
books
old
gardens
and
old
houses
people
pictures
and
even
lightly
politics
robin
found
herself
quite
incidentally
as
it
were
reading
aloud
to
her
an
italian
poem
she
ceased
to
be
afraid
and
was
at
ease
she
forgot
lord
coombe
the
duchess
listening
and
watching
her
warmed
to
her
task
of
delicate
investigation
and
saw
reason
for
anticipating
agreeably
stimulating
things
she
was
not
taking
upon
herself
a
merely
benevolent
duty
which
might
assume
weight
and
become
a
fatigue
in
fact
she
might
trust
coombe
for
that
after
all
it
was
he
who
had
virtually
educated
the
child
little
as
she
was
aware
of
the
singular
fact
it
was
he
who
had
dragged
her
forth
from
her
dog
kennel
of
a
top
floor
nursery
and
quaintly
incongruous
as
it
seemed
had
found
her
a
respectable
woman
for
a
nurse
and
an
intelligent
person
for
a
governess
and
companion
as
if
he
had
been
a
domesticated
middle
class
widower
with
a
little
girl
to
play
mother
to
she
saw
in
the
situation
more
than
others
would
have
seen
in
it
but
she
saw
also
the
ironic
humour
of
it
coombe
with
the
renowned
cut
of
his
overcoat
the
perfection
of
his
line
and
scarcely
to
be
divined
suggestions
of
hue
coombe
she
did
not
avoid
all
mention
of
his
name
during
the
interview
but
she
spoke
of
him
only
casually
and
though
the
salary
she
offered
was
an
excellent
one
it
was
not
inordinate
robin
could
not
feel
that
she
was
not
being
accepted
as
of
the
class
of
young
persons
who
support
themselves
though
even
the
most
modest
earned
income
would
have
represented
wealth
to
her
ignorance
before
they
parted
she
had
obtained
the
position
so
pleasantly
described
by
mademoiselle
valle
as
being
something
like
that
of
a
young
lady
in
waiting
but
i
am
really
a
companion
and
i
will
do
everything
everything
i
can
so
that
i
shall
be
worth
keeping
she
thought
seriously
she
felt
that
she
should
want
to
be
kept
if
lord
coombe
was
a
friend
of
her
employer
it
was
because
the
duchess
did
not
know
what
others
knew
and
her
house
was
not
his
house
and
the
hideous
thing
she
had
secretly
loathed
would
be
at
an
end
she
would
be
supporting
herself
as
decently
and
honestly
as
mademoiselle
or
dowie
had
supported
themselves
all
their
lives
with
an
air
of
incidentally
recalling
a
fact
the
duchess
said
after
they
had
risen
to
leave
her
mademoiselle
valle
tells
me
you
have
an
elderly
nurse
you
are
very
fond
of
she
seems
to
belong
to
a
class
of
servants
almost
extinct
i
love
her
robin
faltered
because
the
sudden
reminder
brought
back
a
pang
to
her
there
was
a
look
in
her
eyes
which
faltered
also
she
loves
me
i
do
know
how
but
there
she
stopped
such
women
are
very
valuable
to
those
who
know
the
meaning
of
their
type
i
myself
am
always
in
search
of
it
my
dear
miss
brent
was
of
it
though
of
a
different
class
but
most
people
do
not
know
said
robin
it
seems
to
them
and
it
beautiful
dowie
is
an
angel
i
should
like
to
secure
your
dowie
for
my
housekeeper
and
myself
one
of
the
greatest
powers
of
the
celebrated
smile
was
its
power
to
convince
a
competent
person
is
needed
to
take
charge
of
the
linen
if
we
can
secure
an
angel
we
shall
be
fortunate
a
day
or
so
later
she
said
to
coombe
in
describing
the
visit
the
child
face
is
wonderful
if
you
could
but
have
seen
her
eyes
when
i
said
it
it
is
not
the
mere
beauty
of
size
and
shape
and
colour
which
affect
one
it
is
something
else
she
is
a
little
flame
of
feeling
the
something
else
was
in
the
sound
of
her
voice
as
she
answered
she
will
be
in
the
same
house
with
me
sometimes
perhaps
i
may
see
her
and
talk
to
her
oh
how
grateful
i
am
she
might
even
see
and
talk
to
her
as
often
as
she
wished
it
revealed
itself
and
when
she
and
mademoiselle
got
into
their
hansom
cab
to
drive
away
she
caught
at
the
frenchwoman
hand
and
clung
to
it
her
eyelashes
wet
it
is
as
if
there
must
be
goodness
which
takes
care
of
one
she
said
i
used
to
believe
in
it
so
until
i
was
afraid
of
all
the
world
dowie
means
most
of
all
i
did
now
know
how
i
could
bear
to
let
her
go
away
and
since
her
husband
and
her
daughter
died
she
has
no
one
but
me
i
should
have
had
no
one
but
her
if
you
had
gone
back
to
belgium
mademoiselle
and
now
she
will
be
safe
in
the
same
house
with
me
perhaps
the
duchess
will
keep
her
until
she
dies
i
hope
she
will
keep
me
until
i
die
i
will
be
as
good
and
faithful
as
dowie
and
perhaps
the
duchess
will
live
until
i
am
quite
old
and
not
pretty
any
more
and
i
will
make
economies
as
you
have
made
them
mademoiselle
and
save
all
my
salary
and
i
might
be
able
to
end
my
days
in
a
little
cottage
in
the
country
mademoiselle
was
conscious
of
an
actual
physical
drag
at
her
heartstrings
the
pulsating
glow
of
her
young
loveliness
had
never
been
more
moving
and
oh
the
sublime
certainty
of
her
unconsciousness
that
life
lay
between
this
hour
and
that
day
when
she
was
quite
old
and
not
pretty
any
more
and
having
made
economies
could
die
in
a
little
cottage
in
the
country
she
believed
in
her
vision
as
she
had
believed
that
donal
would
come
to
her
in
the
garden
upon
feather
the
revelation
that
her
daughter
had
elected
to
join
the
ranks
of
girls
who
were
mysteriously
determined
to
be
responsible
for
themselves
produced
a
curious
combination
of
effects
it
was
presented
to
her
by
lord
coombe
in
the
form
of
a
simple
impersonal
statement
which
had
its
air
of
needing
no
explanation
she
heard
it
with
eyes
widening
a
little
and
a
smile
slowly
growing
having
heard
she
broke
into
a
laugh
a
rather
treble
laugh
really
she
said
she
is
really
going
to
do
it
to
take
a
situation
she
wants
to
be
independent
and
her
own
life
what
a
joke
for
a
girl
of
mine
she
was
either
really
amused
or
chose
to
seem
so
what
do
you
think
of
it
she
asked
when
she
stopped
laughing
her
eyes
had
curiosity
in
them
i
like
it
he
answered
of
course
i
ought
to
have
remembered
that
you
helped
her
to
an
early
victorian
duchess
she
one
without
a
flaw
the
dowager
duchess
of
darte
the
most
conscientiously
careful
mother
object
it
almost
like
entering
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
in
a
dull
way
she
began
to
laugh
again
as
if
amusing
images
rose
suddenly
before
her
and
what
does
the
duchess
think
of
it
she
said
after
her
laughter
had
ceased
again
how
does
she
reconcile
herself
to
the
idea
of
a
companion
whose
mother
she
would
have
in
her
house
we
need
not
enter
into
that
view
of
the
case
you
decided
some
years
ago
that
it
did
not
matter
to
you
whether
early
victorian
duchesses
included
you
in
their
visiting
lists
or
did
not
more
modern
ones
do
i
believe
quite
beautiful
and
amusing
ones
but
for
that
reason
i
want
this
one
and
those
like
her
they
would
bore
me
but
i
want
them
i
want
them
to
come
to
my
house
and
be
polite
to
me
in
their
stuffy
way
i
want
to
be
invited
to
their
hideous
dinner
parties
and
see
them
sitting
round
their
tables
in
their
awful
family
jewels
of
the
sad
deaths
of
kings
that
shakespeare
you
know
i
heard
it
last
night
at
the
theatre
why
do
you
want
it
coombe
inquired
when
i
ask
you
why
you
show
your
morbid
interest
in
robin
you
say
you
do
know
i
do
know
but
i
do
want
it
she
suddenly
flushed
she
even
showed
her
small
teeth
for
an
extraordinary
moment
she
looked
like
a
little
cat
robin
will
hare
it
she
cried
grinding
a
delicate
fist
into
the
palm
on
her
knee
she
not
eighteen
and
she
a
beauty
and
she
taken
up
by
a
perfectly
decent
old
duchess
she
have
everything
the
dowager
will
marry
her
to
someone
important
help
she
turned
on
him
in
a
flame
of
temper
you
are
capable
of
marrying
her
yourself
there
was
a
a
brief
but
entire
silence
it
was
broken
by
his
saying
she
is
not
capable
of
marrying
me
there
was
brief
but
entire
silence
again
and
it
was
he
who
again
broke
it
his
manner
at
once
cool
and
reasonable
it
is
better
not
to
exhibit
this
kind
of
feeling
let
us
be
quite
frank
there
are
few
things
you
feel
more
strongly
than
that
you
do
not
want
your
daughter
in
the
house
when
she
was
a
child
you
told
me
that
you
detested
the
prospect
of
having
her
on
your
hands
she
is
being
disposed
of
in
the
most
easily
explained
and
enviable
manner
it
true
it
true
feather
murmured
she
began
to
see
advantages
and
the
look
of
a
little
cat
died
out
or
at
least
modified
itself
into
that
of
a
little
cat
upon
whom
dawned
prospects
of
cream
no
mood
ever
held
her
very
long
she
wo
come
back
to
stay
she
said
the
duchess
wo
let
her
i
can
use
her
rooms
and
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
have
them
there
at
least
some
advantage
in
figuring
as
a
sort
of
dame
aux
camelias
chapter
xxvii
the
night
before
robin
went
away
as
she
sat
alone
in
the
dimness
of
one
light
thinking
as
girls
nearly
always
sit
and
think
on
the
eve
of
a
change
because
to
youth
any
change
seems
to
mean
the
final
closing
as
well
as
the
opening
of
ways
the
door
of
her
room
was
opened
and
an
exquisite
and
nymphlike
figure
in
pale
green
stood
exactly
where
the
rays
of
the
reading
lamp
seemed
to
concentrate
themselves
in
an
effort
to
reveal
most
purely
its
delicately
startling
effect
it
was
her
mother
in
a
dress
whose
tint
made
her
a
sort
of
slim
dryad
she
looked
so
pretty
and
young
that
robin
caught
her
breath
as
she
rose
and
went
forward
it
is
your
aged
parent
come
to
give
you
her
blessing
said
feather
i
was
wondering
if
i
might
come
to
your
room
in
the
morning
robin
answered
feather
seated
herself
lightly
she
was
not
intelligent
enough
to
have
any
real
comprehension
of
the
mood
which
had
impelled
her
to
come
she
had
merely
given
way
to
a
secret
sense
of
resentment
of
something
which
annoyed
her
she
knew
however
why
she
had
put
on
the
green
dress
which
made
her
look
like
a
girl
she
was
not
going
to
let
robin
feel
as
if
she
were
receiving
a
visit
from
her
grandmother
she
had
got
that
far
we
do
know
each
other
at
all
do
we
she
said
no
answered
robin
she
could
not
remove
her
eyes
from
her
loveliness
she
brought
up
such
memories
of
the
lady
downstairs
and
the
desolate
child
in
the
shabby
nursery
mothers
are
not
as
intimate
with
their
daughters
as
they
used
to
be
when
it
was
a
sort
of
virtuous
fashion
to
superintend
their
rice
pudding
and
lecture
them
about
their
lessons
we
have
not
seen
each
other
often
no
said
robin
feather
laugh
had
again
the
rather
high
note
coombe
had
noticed
you
have
very
much
to
say
have
you
she
commented
and
you
stare
at
me
as
if
you
were
trying
to
explain
me
i
dare
say
you
know
that
you
have
big
eyes
and
that
they
a
good
colour
but
i
may
as
well
hint
to
you
that
men
do
not
like
to
be
stared
at
as
if
their
deeps
were
being
searched
drop
your
eyelids
robin
lids
dropped
in
spite
of
herself
because
she
was
startled
but
immediately
she
was
startled
again
by
a
note
in
her
voice
a
note
of
added
irritation
do
make
a
habit
of
dropping
them
too
often
it
broke
out
or
it
will
look
as
if
you
did
it
to
show
your
eyelashes
girls
with
tricks
of
that
sort
are
always
laughed
at
alison
carr
lives
sideways
became
she
has
a
pretty
profile
coombe
would
have
recognized
the
little
cat
look
if
he
had
been
watching
her
as
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
scrutinized
her
daughter
the
fact
was
that
she
took
in
her
every
point
being
an
astute
censor
of
other
women
charms
stand
up
she
said
robin
stood
up
because
she
could
not
well
refuse
to
do
so
but
she
coloured
because
she
was
suddenly
ashamed
you
not
little
but
you
not
tall
her
mother
said
against
you
it
the
fashion
for
women
to
be
immensely
tall
now
du
maurier
pictures
in
punch
and
his
idiotic
trilby
did
it
clothes
are
made
for
giantesses
i
do
care
about
it
myself
but
a
girl
rather
out
of
it
if
she
much
less
than
six
feet
high
you
can
sit
down
a
more
singular
interview
between
mother
and
daughter
had
assuredly
rarely
taken
place
as
she
looked
at
the
girl
her
resentment
of
her
increased
each
moment
she
actually
felt
as
if
she
were
beginning
to
lose
her
temper
you
are
what
pious
people
call
out
into
the
world
she
went
on
in
moral
books
mothers
always
give
advice
and
warnings
to
their
girls
when
they
leaving
them
i
can
give
you
some
warnings
you
think
that
because
you
have
been
taken
up
by
a
dowager
duchess
everything
will
be
plain
sailing
you
mistaken
you
think
because
you
are
eighteen
and
pretty
men
will
fall
at
your
feet
i
would
rather
be
hideous
cried
suddenly
passionate
robin
i
hate
men
the
silly
pretty
thing
who
was
responsible
for
her
being
grew
sillier
as
her
irritation
increased
that
what
girls
always
pretend
but
the
youngest
little
idiot
knows
it
is
true
it
men
who
count
it
makes
me
laugh
when
i
think
of
them
and
of
you
you
know
nothing
about
them
and
they
know
everything
about
you
a
clever
man
can
do
anything
he
pleases
with
a
silly
girl
are
they
all
bad
robin
exclaimed
furiously
they
none
of
them
bad
they
only
men
and
that
my
warning
do
imagine
that
when
they
make
love
to
you
they
do
it
as
if
you
were
the
old
duchess
granddaughter
you
will
only
be
her
paid
companion
and
that
a
different
matter
i
will
not
speak
to
one
of
them
robin
actually
began
you
be
obliged
to
do
what
the
duchess
tells
you
to
do
laughed
feather
as
she
realized
her
obvious
power
to
dull
the
glitter
and
glow
of
things
which
she
had
felt
the
girl
must
be
dazzled
and
uplifted
unduly
by
she
was
rather
like
a
spiteful
schoolgirl
entertaining
herself
by
spoiling
an
envied
holiday
for
a
companion
old
men
will
run
after
you
and
you
will
have
to
be
nice
to
them
whether
you
like
it
or
not
a
queer
light
came
into
her
eyes
lord
coombe
is
fond
of
girls
just
out
of
the
schoolroom
but
if
he
begins
to
make
love
to
you
do
allow
yourself
to
feel
too
much
flattered
robin
sprang
toward
her
do
you
think
i
do
abhor
lord
coombe
she
cried
out
forgetting
herself
in
the
desperate
cruelty
of
the
moment
have
i
reason
but
there
she
remembered
and
stopped
but
feather
was
not
shocked
or
alarmed
years
of
looking
things
in
the
face
had
provided
her
with
a
mental
surface
from
which
tilings
rebounded
on
the
whole
it
even
amused
her
and
suited
her
book
that
robin
should
take
this
tone
oh
i
suppose
you
mean
you
know
he
admires
me
and
pays
bills
for
me
where
would
you
have
been
if
he
had
done
it
he
been
a
sort
of
benefactor
i
know
nothing
but
that
even
when
i
was
a
little
child
i
could
not
bear
to
touch
his
hand
cried
robin
then
feather
remembered
several
things
she
had
almost
forgotten
and
she
was
still
more
entertained
i
believe
you
not
forgotten
through
all
these
years
that
the
boy
you
fell
so
indecently
in
love
with
was
taken
away
by
his
mother
because
lord
coombe
was
your
mother
admirer
and
he
was
such
a
sinner
that
even
a
baby
was
contaminated
by
him
donal
muir
is
a
young
man
by
this
time
i
wonder
what
his
mother
would
do
now
if
he
turned
up
at
your
mistress
house
that
what
she
is
you
know
your
mistress
and
began
to
make
love
to
you
she
laughed
outright
you
get
into
all
sorts
of
messes
but
that
would
be
the
nicest
one
robin
could
only
stand
and
gaze
at
her
her
moment
fire
had
died
down
without
warning
out
of
the
past
a
wave
rose
and
overwhelmed
her
then
and
there
it
bore
with
it
the
wild
woe
of
the
morning
when
a
child
had
waited
in
the
spring
sun
and
her
world
had
fallen
into
nothingness
it
came
back
the
anguish
the
utter
helpless
desolation
as
if
she
stood
in
the
midst
of
it
again
as
if
it
had
never
passed
it
was
a
she
could
not
bear
it
do
you
hate
me
as
i
hate
lord
coombe
she
cried
out
do
you
want
unhappy
things
to
happen
to
me
oh
mother
why
she
had
never
said
mother
before
nature
said
it
for
her
here
the
piteous
appeal
of
her
youth
and
lonely
young
rush
of
tears
was
almost
intolerably
sweet
through
some
subtle
cause
it
added
to
the
thing
in
her
which
feather
resented
and
longed
to
trouble
and
to
hurt
you
are
a
spiteful
little
cat
she
sprang
up
to
exclaim
standing
close
and
face
to
face
with
her
you
think
i
am
an
old
thing
and
that
i
jealous
of
you
because
you
pretty
and
a
girl
you
think
women
past
thirty
do
count
you
find
out
muir
will
count
and
she
forty
if
she
a
day
her
son
such
a
beauty
that
people
go
mad
over
him
and
he
worships
her
and
he
her
slave
i
wish
you
would
get
into
some
mess
you
could
get
out
of
do
come
to
me
if
you
do
the
wide
beauty
of
robin
gaze
and
her
tear
wet
bloom
were
too
much
feather
was
quite
close
to
her
the
spiteful
schoolgirl
impulse
got
the
better
of
her
do
make
eyes
at
me
like
that
she
cried
and
she
actually
gave
the
rose
cheek
nearest
her
a
sounding
little
slap
there
she
exclaimed
hysterically
and
she
turned
about
and
ran
out
of
the
room
crying
herself
robin
had
parted
from
mademoiselle
valle
at
charing
cross
station
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
but
the
night
before
they
had
sat
up
late
together
and
talked
a
long
time
in
effect
mademoiselle
had
said
also
you
are
going
out
into
the
world
but
she
had
not
approached
the
matter
in
mood
one
may
have
charge
of
a
girl
and
be
her
daily
companion
for
years
but
there
are
certain
things
the
very
years
themselves
make
it
increasingly
difficult
to
say
to
her
and
after
all
why
should
one
state
difficult
things
in
exact
phrases
unless
one
lacks
breeding
and
is
curious
anxious
she
had
been
at
times
but
not
curious
so
it
was
that
even
on
this
night
of
their
parting
it
was
not
she
who
spoke
it
was
after
a
few
minutes
of
sitting
in
silence
and
looking
at
the
fire
that
robin
broke
in
upon
the
quiet
which
had
seemed
to
hold
them
both
i
must
learn
to
remember
always
that
i
am
a
sort
of
servant
i
must
be
very
careful
it
will
be
easier
for
me
to
realize
that
i
am
not
in
my
own
house
than
it
would
be
for
other
girls
i
have
not
allowed
dowie
to
dress
me
for
a
good
many
weeks
i
have
learned
how
to
do
everything
for
myself
quite
well
but
dowie
will
be
in
the
house
with
you
and
the
duchess
is
very
kind
every
night
i
have
begun
my
prayers
by
thanking
god
for
leaving
me
dowie
the
girl
said
i
have
begun
them
and
ended
them
with
the
same
words
she
looked
about
her
and
then
broke
out
as
if
involuntarily
i
shall
be
away
from
here
i
shall
not
wear
anything
or
eat
anything
or
sleep
on
any
bed
i
have
not
paid
for
myself
these
rooms
are
very
pretty
we
have
been
very
comfortable
here
mademoiselle
said
suddenly
she
felt
that
if
she
waited
a
few
moments
she
would
know
definitely
things
she
had
previously
only
guessed
at
have
you
no
little
regrets
no
answered
robin
no
she
stood
upon
the
hearth
with
her
hands
behind
her
mademoiselle
felt
as
if
her
fingers
were
twisting
themselves
together
and
the
frenchwoman
was
peculiarly
moved
by
the
fact
that
she
looked
like
a
slim
jeune
fille
of
a
creature
saying
a
lesson
the
lesson
opened
in
this
wise
i
do
know
when
i
first
began
to
know
that
i
was
different
from
all
other
children
she
said
in
a
soft
hot
voice
if
a
voice
can
express
heat
perhaps
a
child
who
has
nothing
nothing
is
obliged
to
begin
to
think
before
it
knows
what
thoughts
are
if
they
play
and
are
loved
and
amused
they
have
no
time
for
anything
but
growing
and
being
happy
you
never
saw
the
dreadful
little
rooms
upstairs
dowie
has
told
me
of
them
said
mademoiselle
another
child
might
have
forgotten
them
i
never
shall
i
i
was
so
little
and
they
were
full
of
something
awful
it
was
loneliness
the
first
time
andrews
pinched
me
was
one
day
when
the
thing
frightened
me
and
i
suddenly
began
to
cry
quite
loud
i
used
to
stare
out
of
the
window
and
i
do
know
when
i
noticed
it
first
i
could
see
the
children
being
taken
out
by
their
nurses
and
there
were
always
two
or
three
of
them
and
they
laughed
and
talked
and
skipped
the
nurses
used
to
laugh
and
talk
too
andrews
never
did
when
she
took
me
to
the
gardens
the
other
nurses
sat
together
and
chattered
and
their
children
played
games
with
other
children
once
a
little
girl
began
to
talk
to
me
and
her
nurse
called
her
away
andrews
was
very
angry
and
jerked
me
by
my
arm
and
told
me
that
if
ever
i
spoke
to
a
child
again
she
would
pinch
me
devil
exclaimed
the
frenchwoman
i
used
to
think
and
think
but
i
could
never
understand
how
could
i
a
baby
cried
mademoiselle
valle
and
she
got
up
and
took
her
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
chere
petite
ange
she
murmured
when
she
sat
down
again
her
cheeks
were
wet
robin
were
wet
also
but
she
touched
them
with
her
handkerchief
quickly
and
dried
them
it
was
as
if
she
had
faltered
for
a
moment
in
her
lesson
did
dowie
ever
tell
you
anything
about
donal
she
asked
hesitatingly
something
he
was
the
little
boy
you
played
with
yes
he
was
the
first
human
creature
she
said
it
very
slowly
as
if
trying
to
find
the
right
words
to
express
what
she
meant
the
first
human
creature
i
had
ever
known
you
see
mademoiselle
he
he
knew
everything
he
had
always
been
happy
he
belonged
to
people
and
things
i
belonged
to
nobody
and
nothing
if
i
had
been
like
him
he
would
not
have
seemed
so
wonderful
to
me
i
was
in
a
kind
of
delirium
of
joy
if
a
creature
who
had
been
deaf
dumb
and
blind
had
suddenly
awakened
and
seeing
on
a
summer
day
in
a
world
full
of
flowers
and
sun
it
might
have
seemed
to
them
as
it
seemed
to
me
you
have
remembered
it
through
all
the
years
said
mademoiselle
like
that
it
was
the
first
time
i
became
alive
one
could
not
forget
it
we
only
played
as
children
play
but
it
was
a
delirium
of
joy
i
could
not
bear
to
go
to
sleep
at
night
and
forget
it
for
a
moment
yes
i
remember
it
like
that
there
is
a
dream
i
have
every
now
and
then
and
it
is
more
real
than
than
this
is
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
about
her
i
am
always
in
a
real
garden
playing
with
a
real
donal
and
his
eyes
his
eyes
she
paused
and
thought
there
is
a
look
in
them
that
is
like
it
is
just
like
that
first
morning
the
change
which
passed
over
her
face
the
next
moment
might
have
been
said
to
seem
to
obliterate
all
trace
of
the
childish
memory
he
was
taken
away
by
his
mother
that
was
the
beginning
of
my
finding
out
she
said
i
heard
andrews
talking
to
her
sister
and
in
a
baby
way
i
gathered
that
lord
coombe
had
sent
him
i
hated
lord
coombe
for
years
before
i
found
out
that
he
had
and
that
there
was
another
reason
after
that
it
took
time
to
puzzle
things
out
and
piece
them
together
but
at
last
i
found
out
what
the
reason
had
been
then
i
began
to
make
plans
these
are
not
my
rooms
glancing
about
her
again
these
are
not
my
clothes
with
a
little
pull
at
her
dress
i
not
strong
character
mademoiselle
as
i
wanted
to
be
but
i
have
one
little
regret
not
one
she
kneeled
down
and
put
her
arms
round
her
old
waist
lifting
her
face
i
like
a
leaf
blown
about
by
the
wind
i
do
know
what
it
will
do
with
me
where
do
leaves
go
one
never
knows
really
she
put
her
face
down
on
mademoiselle
knee
then
and
cried
with
soft
bitterness
when
she
bade
her
at
charing
cross
station
and
stood
and
watched
the
train
until
it
was
quite
out
of
sight
afterwards
she
went
back
to
the
rooms
for
which
she
felt
no
regrets
and
before
she
went
to
bed
that
night
feather
came
and
gave
her
farewell
maternal
advice
and
warning
chapter
xxviii
that
a
previously
scarcely
suspected
daughter
of
had
become
a
member
of
the
household
of
the
dowager
duchess
of
darte
stirred
but
a
passing
wave
of
interest
in
a
circle
which
was
not
that
of
herself
and
which
upon
the
whole
but
casually
acknowledged
its
curious
existence
as
a
modern
abnormality
also
the
attitude
of
the
duchess
herself
was
composedly
free
from
any
admission
of
necessity
for
comment
i
have
no
pretty
young
relative
who
can
be
spared
to
come
and
live
with
me
i
am
fond
of
things
pretty
and
young
and
i
am
greatly
pleased
with
what
a
kind
chance
put
in
my
way
she
said
in
her
discussion
of
the
situation
with
coombe
she
measured
it
with
her
customary
fine
acumen
forty
years
ago
it
could
not
have
been
done
the
girl
would
have
been
made
uncomfortable
and
outside
things
could
not
have
been
prevented
from
dragging
themselves
in
filial
piety
in
the
mass
would
have
demanded
that
the
mother
should
be
accounted
for
now
a
genial
knowledge
of
a
variety
in
mothers
leaves
to
play
about
with
her
own
probably
quite
amusing
set
once
poor
robin
would
have
been
held
responsible
for
her
and
so
should
i
my
position
would
have
seemed
to
defy
serious
moral
issues
but
we
have
reached
a
sane
habit
of
detaching
people
from
their
relations
a
nice
condition
we
should
be
in
if
we
had
not
you
of
course
know
that
henry
died
suddenly
in
some
sort
of
fit
at
ostend
coombe
said
it
as
if
in
a
form
of
reply
she
had
naturally
become
aware
of
it
when
the
rest
of
the
world
did
but
had
not
seen
him
since
the
event
one
did
not
suppose
his
constitution
would
have
lasted
so
long
she
answered
you
are
more
fortunate
in
young
donal
muir
have
you
seen
him
and
his
mother
i
made
a
special
journey
to
braemarnie
and
had
a
curious
interview
with
muir
when
i
say
i
do
mean
to
imply
that
it
was
not
entirely
dignified
it
was
curious
only
because
i
realize
that
secretly
she
regards
with
horror
and
dread
the
fact
that
her
boy
is
the
prospective
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
she
does
not
make
a
jest
of
it
as
i
have
had
the
temerity
to
do
it
a
cheap
defense
this
trick
of
making
an
eternal
jest
of
things
but
it
is
a
defense
and
one
has
formed
the
habit
she
has
never
done
it
helen
muir
his
friend
said
on
the
whole
i
believe
she
at
times
knows
that
she
has
been
too
grave
she
was
a
beautiful
creature
passionately
in
love
with
her
husband
when
such
a
husband
is
taken
away
from
such
a
woman
and
his
child
is
left
it
often
happens
that
the
flood
of
her
love
is
turned
into
one
current
and
that
it
is
almost
overwhelming
she
is
too
sane
to
have
coddled
the
boy
and
made
him
effeminate
what
has
she
done
instead
he
is
a
splendid
young
highlander
he
would
be
too
if
he
were
not
as
strong
and
active
as
a
young
stag
all
she
has
done
is
to
so
fill
him
with
the
power
and
sense
of
her
charm
that
he
has
not
seen
enough
of
the
world
or
learned
to
care
for
it
she
is
the
one
woman
on
earth
for
him
and
life
with
her
at
braemarnie
is
all
he
asks
for
your
difficulty
will
be
that
she
will
not
be
willing
to
trust
him
to
your
instructions
i
have
not
as
much
personal
vanity
as
i
may
seem
to
have
coombe
said
i
put
all
egotism
modestly
aside
when
i
talked
to
her
and
tried
to
explain
that
i
would
endeavour
to
see
that
he
came
to
no
harm
in
my
society
my
heir
presumptive
and
i
must
see
something
of
each
other
and
he
must
become
intimate
with
the
prospect
of
his
responsibilities
more
will
be
demanded
of
the
next
marquis
of
coombe
than
has
been
demanded
of
me
and
it
will
be
demanded
not
merely
hoped
for
or
expected
and
it
will
be
the
overwhelming
forces
of
fate
which
will
demand
it
not
mere
tenants
or
constituents
or
the
general
public
have
you
any
views
as
to
what
will
be
demanded
was
her
interested
question
none
neither
has
anyone
else
who
shares
my
opinion
no
one
will
have
any
until
the
readjustment
comes
but
before
the
readjustment
there
will
be
the
pouring
forth
of
blood
the
blood
of
magnificent
lads
like
donal
muir
perhaps
his
own
blood
my
god
and
there
may
be
left
no
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
from
the
duchess
there
will
be
many
a
house
left
without
its
head
houses
great
and
small
and
if
the
peril
of
it
were
more
generally
foreseen
at
this
date
it
would
be
less
perilous
than
it
is
lads
like
that
said
the
old
duchess
bitterly
lads
in
their
strength
and
joy
and
bloom
it
is
hideous
in
all
their
young
virility
and
promise
for
a
next
generation
the
strong
young
fathers
of
forever
unborn
millions
it
damnable
and
it
will
be
so
not
only
in
england
but
all
over
a
blood
drenched
world
it
was
in
this
way
they
talked
to
each
other
of
the
black
tragedy
for
which
they
believed
the
world
stage
already
being
set
in
secret
and
though
there
were
here
and
there
others
who
felt
the
ominous
inevitability
of
the
raising
of
the
curtain
the
rest
of
the
world
looked
on
in
careless
indifference
to
the
significance
of
the
open
training
of
its
actors
and
even
the
resounding
hammerings
of
its
stage
carpenters
and
builders
in
these
days
the
two
discussed
the
matter
more
frequently
and
even
in
the
tone
of
those
who
waited
for
the
approach
of
a
thing
drawing
nearer
every
day
each
time
the
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
made
one
of
his
week
end
visits
to
the
parts
an
englishman
can
reach
only
by
crossing
the
channel
he
returned
with
new
knowledge
of
the
special
direction
in
which
the
wind
veered
in
the
blowing
of
those
straws
he
had
so
long
observed
with
absorbed
interest
above
all
the
common
sounds
of
daily
human
life
one
hears
in
that
one
land
the
rattle
and
clash
of
arms
and
the
unending
thudding
tread
of
marching
feet
he
said
after
one
such
visit
two
generations
of
men
creatures
bred
and
born
and
trained
to
live
as
parts
of
a
huge
death
dealing
machine
have
resulted
in
a
monstrous
construction
each
man
is
a
part
of
it
and
each
part
greatest
ambition
is
to
respond
to
the
shouted
word
of
command
as
a
mechanical
puppet
responds
to
the
touch
of
a
spring
to
each
unit
of
the
millions
love
of
his
own
country
means
only
hatred
of
all
others
and
the
belief
that
no
other
should
be
allowed
existence
the
sacred
creed
of
each
is
that
the
immensity
of
germany
is
such
that
there
can
be
no
room
on
the
earth
for
another
than
itself
blood
and
iron
will
clear
the
world
of
the
inferior
peoples
to
the
masses
that
is
their
god
will
their
god
is
an
understudy
of
their
kaiser
you
are
not
saying
that
as
part
of
the
trick
of
making
a
jest
of
things
i
wish
to
god
i
were
the
poor
huge
inhuman
thing
he
has
built
does
not
know
that
when
he
was
a
boy
he
did
not
play
at
war
and
battles
as
other
boys
do
but
as
a
creature
obsessed
he
has
played
at
soldiers
with
his
people
as
his
toys
throughout
all
his
morbid
life
and
he
has
hungered
and
thirsted
as
he
has
done
it
a
bible
lay
upon
the
table
and
the
duchess
drew
it
towards
her
there
is
a
verse
here
she
said
i
will
find
it
she
turned
the
pages
and
found
it
listen
this
and
lay
it
to
thy
heart
this
day
jehovah
is
god
in
heaven
above
and
on
the
earth
beneath
there
is
none
else
that
is
a
power
which
does
not
confine
itself
to
germany
or
to
england
or
france
or
to
the
map
of
europe
it
is
the
law
of
the
universe
and
even
wilhelm
the
second
can
not
bend
it
to
his
almighty
will
is
none
else
is
none
else
repeated
coombe
slowly
if
there
existed
a
human
being
with
the
power
to
drive
that
home
as
a
truth
into
his
delirious
brain
i
believe
he
would
die
raving
mad
to
him
there
is
no
first
cause
which
was
not
in
germany
and
it
is
one
of
his
most
valuable
theatrical
assets
it
is
part
of
his
paraphernalia
like
the
jangling
of
his
sword
and
the
glitter
of
his
orders
he
shakes
it
before
his
people
to
arrest
the
attention
of
the
simple
and
honest
ones
as
one
jingles
a
rattle
before
a
child
there
are
those
among
them
who
are
not
so
readily
attracted
by
terms
of
blood
and
iron
but
they
will
be
called
upon
to
shed
blood
and
to
pour
forth
their
own
there
will
be
young
things
like
donal
muir
lads
with
ruddy
cheeks
and
with
white
bodies
to
be
torn
to
fragments
she
shuddered
as
she
said
it
i
am
afraid
she
said
i
am
afraid
so
am
i
coombe
answered
of
what
is
coming
what
a
fool
i
have
been
how
long
will
it
be
before
other
men
awaken
to
say
the
same
thing
each
man
folly
is
his
own
shame
he
drew
himself
stiffly
upright
as
a
man
might
who
stood
before
a
firing
squad
i
had
a
life
to
live
or
to
throw
away
because
i
was
hideously
wounded
at
the
outset
i
threw
it
aside
as
done
for
i
said
is
neither
god
nor
devil
vice
nor
virtue
love
nor
hate
i
will
do
and
leave
undone
what
i
choose
i
had
power
and
brain
and
money
a
man
who
could
see
clearly
and
who
had
words
to
choose
from
might
have
stood
firmly
in
the
place
to
which
he
was
born
and
have
spoken
in
a
voice
which
might
have
been
listened
to
he
might
have
fought
against
folly
and
blindness
and
lassitude
i
deliberately
chose
privately
to
sneer
at
the
thought
of
lifting
a
hand
to
serve
any
thing
but
the
cold
fool
who
was
myself
life
passes
quickly
it
does
not
turn
back
he
ended
with
a
short
harsh
laugh
this
is
fear
he
said
fear
clears
a
man
mind
of
rubbish
and
it
is
because
i
am
afraid
that
i
accuse
myself
and
it
is
not
for
myself
or
you
but
for
the
whole
world
which
before
the
end
comes
will
seem
to
fall
into
fragments
you
have
been
seeing
ominous
signs
the
duchess
said
leaning
forward
and
speaking
low
there
have
been
affectionate
visits
to
vienna
there
is
a
certain
thing
in
the
air
in
the
arrogance
of
the
bearing
of
men
clanking
their
sabres
as
they
stride
through
the
streets
there
is
an
exultant
eagerness
in
their
eyes
things
are
said
which
hold
scarcely
concealed
braggart
threats
they
have
always
been
given
to
that
sort
of
thing
but
now
it
strikes
one
as
a
thing
unleashed
or
barely
leashed
at
all
the
background
of
the
sound
of
clashing
arms
and
the
thudding
of
marching
feet
is
more
unendingly
present
one
can
not
get
away
from
it
the
great
munition
factories
are
working
night
and
day
in
the
streets
in
private
houses
in
the
shops
one
hears
and
recognizes
signs
they
are
signs
which
might
not
be
clear
to
one
who
has
not
spent
years
in
looking
on
with
interested
eyes
but
i
have
watched
too
long
to
see
only
the
surface
of
things
the
nation
is
waiting
for
something
waiting
what
will
be
the
pretext
what
the
duchess
pondered
any
pretext
will
do
or
none
except
that
germany
must
have
what
she
wants
and
that
she
is
strong
enough
to
take
it
after
forty
years
of
building
her
machine
and
we
others
have
built
none
we
almost
deserve
whatever
comes
to
us
the
old
woman
face
was
darkly
grave
in
three
villages
where
i
chance
to
be
lord
of
the
manor
i
have
by
means
of
my
own
set
lads
drilling
and
training
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
form
of
amusement
and
an
eccentric
whim
of
mine
and
it
is
a
change
from
eternal
cricket
i
have
given
prizes
and
made
an
occasional
speech
on
the
ground
that
english
brawn
is
so
enviable
a
possession
that
it
ought
to
develop
itself
to
the
utmost
when
i
once
went
to
the
length
of
adding
that
each
englishman
should
be
muscle
fit
and
ready
in
case
of
england
sudden
need
i
saw
the
lads
grin
cheerfully
at
the
thought
of
england
in
any
such
plight
their
innocent
swaggering
belief
that
the
country
is
always
ready
for
everything
moved
my
heart
of
stone
and
it
is
men
like
myself
who
are
to
blame
not
merely
men
of
my
class
but
men
of
my
kind
those
who
have
chosen
to
detach
themselves
from
everything
but
the
living
of
life
as
it
best
pleased
their
tastes
or
served
their
personal
ambitions
are
we
going
to
be
taught
that
man
can
not
argue
without
including
his
fellow
man
are
we
going
to
be
forced
to
learn
it
she
said
yes
forced
nothing
but
force
could
reach
us
the
race
is
an
undeveloped
thing
a
few
centuries
later
it
will
have
evolved
another
sense
this
century
may
see
the
first
huge
step
because
the
power
of
a
cataclysm
sweeps
it
forward
he
turned
his
glance
towards
the
opening
door
robin
came
in
with
some
letters
in
her
hand
he
was
vaguely
aware
that
she
wore
an
aspect
he
was
unfamiliar
with
the
girl
of
had
in
the
past
as
it
went
without
saying
expressed
the
final
note
of
priceless
simplicity
and
mode
the
more
finely
simple
she
looked
the
more
priceless
the
unfamiliarity
in
her
outward
seeming
lay
in
the
fact
that
her
quiet
dun
tweed
dress
with
its
lines
of
white
at
neck
and
wrists
was
not
priceless
though
it
was
well
made
it
in
fact
unobtrusively
suggested
that
it
was
meant
for
service
rather
than
for
adornment
her
hair
was
dressed
closely
and
her
movements
were
very
quiet
coombe
realized
that
her
greeting
of
him
was
delicately
respectful
i
have
finished
the
letters
she
said
to
the
duchess
i
hope
they
are
what
you
want
sometimes
i
am
afraid
do
be
afraid
said
the
duchess
kindly
you
write
very
correct
and
graceful
little
letters
they
are
always
what
i
want
have
you
been
out
today
not
yet
robin
hesitated
a
little
have
i
your
permission
to
ask
james
if
it
will
be
convenient
to
her
to
let
dowie
go
with
me
for
an
hour
yes
as
kindly
as
before
for
two
hours
if
you
like
i
shall
not
drive
this
afternoon
thank
you
said
robin
and
went
out
of
the
room
as
quietly
as
she
had
entered
it
when
the
door
closed
the
duchess
was
smiling
at
lord
coombe
i
understand
her
she
said
she
is
sustained
and
comforted
by
her
pretty
air
of
servitude
she
might
use
dowie
as
her
personal
maid
and
do
next
to
nothing
but
she
waits
upon
herself
and
punctiliously
asks
my
permission
to
approach
james
the
housekeeper
with
any
request
for
a
favour
her
one
desire
is
to
be
sure
that
she
is
earning
her
living
as
other
young
women
do
when
they
are
paid
for
their
work
i
should
really
like
to
pet
and
indulge
her
but
it
would
only
make
her
unhappy
i
invent
tasks
for
her
which
are
quite
unnecessary
for
years
the
little
soul
has
been
yearning
and
praying
for
this
opportunity
to
stand
honestly
on
her
own
feet
and
she
can
scarcely
persuade
herself
that
it
has
been
given
to
her
it
must
not
be
spoiled
for
her
i
send
her
on
errands
my
maid
could
perform
i
have
given
her
a
little
room
with
a
serious
business
air
it
is
full
of
files
and
papers
and
she
sits
in
it
and
copies
things
for
me
and
even
looks
over
accounts
she
is
clever
at
looking
up
references
i
have
let
her
sit
up
quite
late
once
or
twice
searching
for
detail
and
dates
for
my
use
it
made
her
bloom
with
joy
you
are
quite
the
most
delightful
woman
in
the
world
said
coombe
quite
chapter
xxix
in
the
serious
little
room
the
duchess
had
given
to
her
robin
built
for
herself
a
condition
she
called
happiness
she
drew
the
spiritual
substance
from
which
it
was
made
from
her
pleasure
in
the
books
of
reference
closely
fitted
into
their
shelves
in
the
files
for
letters
and
more
imposing
documents
in
the
varieties
of
letter
paper
and
envelopes
of
different
sizes
and
materials
which
had
been
provided
for
her
use
in
case
of
necessity
you
may
not
use
the
more
substantial
ones
often
but
you
must
be
prepared
for
any
unexpected
contingency
the
duchess
had
explained
thereby
smoothing
her
pathway
by
the
suggestion
of
responsibilities
the
girl
did
not
know
the
extent
of
her
employer
consideration
for
her
but
she
knew
that
she
was
kind
with
a
special
grace
and
comprehension
a
subtle
truth
she
also
did
not
recognize
was
that
the
remote
flame
of
her
own
being
was
fiercely
alert
in
its
readiness
to
leap
upward
at
any
suspicion
that
her
duties
were
not
worth
the
payment
made
for
them
and
that
for
any
reason
which
might
include
lord
coombe
she
was
occupying
a
position
which
was
a
sinecure
she
kept
her
serious
little
room
in
order
herself
dusting
and
almost
polishing
the
reference
books
arranging
and
the
files
with
such
exactness
of
system
that
she
could
as
is
the
vaunt
of
the
model
of
orderly
perfection
lay
her
hand
upon
any
document
in
the
dark
she
was
punctuality
self
and
held
herself
in
readiness
at
any
moment
to
appear
at
the
duchess
side
as
if
a
magician
had
instantaneously
transported
her
there
before
the
softly
melodious
private
bell
connected
with
her
room
had
ceased
to
vibrate
the
correctness
of
her
to
deference
to
the
convenience
of
james
the
housekeeper
in
her
simplest
communication
with
dowie
quite
touched
that
respectable
heart
she
a
young
lady
james
remarked
to
dowie
and
a
credit
to
you
and
her
governess
dowson
young
ladies
have
gone
almost
out
of
fashion
mademoiselle
valle
had
spent
her
governessing
days
among
the
highest
my
own
places
were
always
with
nothing
ever
came
near
her
that
could
spoil
her
manners
a
good
heart
she
was
born
with
was
the
civil
reply
of
dowie
nothing
ever
came
near
her
james
politely
checked
what
she
became
conscious
was
a
sort
of
unconscious
exclamation
nothing
said
dowie
going
on
with
her
sheet
hemming
steadily
robin
wrote
letters
and
copied
various
documents
for
the
duchess
she
went
shopping
with
her
and
executed
commissions
to
order
she
was
allowed
to
enter
into
correspondence
with
the
village
schoolmistress
and
the
wife
of
the
vicar
at
darte
norham
and
to
buy
prizes
for
notable
decorum
and
scholarship
in
the
school
and
baby
linen
and
blankets
for
the
maternity
bag
and
other
benevolences
she
liked
buying
prizes
and
the
baby
clothes
very
much
because
though
she
was
unaware
of
the
fact
her
youth
delighted
in
youngness
and
the
fulfilling
of
young
desires
even
oftener
and
more
significantly
than
ever
did
eyes
turn
towards
her
try
to
hold
hers
look
after
her
eagerly
when
she
walked
in
the
streets
or
drove
with
the
duchess
in
the
barouche
more
and
more
she
became
used
to
it
and
gradually
she
ceased
to
be
afraid
of
it
and
began
to
feel
it
nearly
always
there
were
sometimes
exceptions
a
friendly
thing
she
saw
friendliness
in
it
because
when
she
caught
sight
as
she
so
often
did
of
young
things
like
herself
passing
in
pairs
laughing
and
talking
and
turning
to
look
into
each
other
eyes
her
being
told
her
that
it
was
sweet
and
human
and
inevitable
they
always
turned
and
looked
at
each
other
these
pairs
and
then
they
smiled
or
laughed
or
flushed
a
little
as
she
had
not
known
when
first
she
recognized
as
she
looked
down
into
the
street
from
her
nursery
window
that
the
children
nearly
always
passed
in
twos
or
threes
and
laughed
and
skipped
and
talked
so
she
did
not
know
when
she
first
began
to
notice
these
joyous
young
pairs
and
a
certain
touch
of
exultation
in
them
and
feel
that
it
was
sweet
and
quite
a
simple
common
natural
thing
her
noting
and
being
sometimes
moved
by
it
was
as
natural
as
her
pleasure
in
the
opening
of
spring
flowers
or
the
new
thrill
of
spring
birds
but
she
did
not
know
that
either
the
brain
which
has
worked
through
many
years
in
unison
with
the
soul
to
which
it
was
apportioned
has
evolved
a
knowledge
which
has
deep
cognizance
of
the
universal
law
the
brain
of
the
old
duchess
had
so
worked
keeping
pace
always
with
its
guide
never
visualizing
the
possibility
of
working
alone
also
never
falling
into
the
abyss
of
that
human
folly
whose
conviction
is
that
all
that
one
sees
and
gives
a
special
name
to
is
all
that
exists
or
that
the
names
accepted
by
the
world
justly
and
clearly
describe
qualities
yearnings
moods
as
they
are
this
had
developed
within
her
wide
perception
and
a
wisdom
which
was
sane
and
kind
to
tenderness
as
she
drove
through
the
streets
with
robin
beside
her
she
saw
the
following
eyes
she
saw
the
girl
soft
friendly
look
at
the
young
creatures
who
passed
her
glowing
and
uplifted
by
the
joy
of
life
and
she
was
moved
and
even
disturbed
after
her
return
from
one
particular
morning
outing
she
sent
for
dowie
you
have
taken
care
of
miss
robin
since
she
was
a
little
child
she
began
she
was
not
quite
six
when
i
first
went
to
her
your
grace
you
are
not
of
the
women
who
only
feed
and
bathe
a
child
and
keep
her
well
dressed
you
have
been
a
sort
of
mother
to
her
i
tried
to
your
grace
i
loved
her
and
watched
over
her
and
she
loved
me
i
do
believe
that
is
why
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
her
dowie
if
you
were
the
woman
who
merely
comes
and
goes
in
a
child
life
i
could
not
she
is
a
very
beautiful
young
thing
dowie
from
her
little
head
to
her
slim
bits
of
feet
your
grace
no
one
knows
better
than
i
do
the
duchess
renowned
smile
revealed
itself
a
beautiful
young
thing
ought
to
see
and
know
other
beautiful
young
things
and
make
friends
with
them
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
for
their
being
put
in
the
world
since
she
has
been
with
me
she
has
spoken
to
no
one
under
forty
has
she
never
had
young
friends
never
your
grace
once
two
young
baggages
were
left
to
have
tea
with
her
and
they
talked
to
her
about
divorce
scandals
and
corespondents
she
never
wanted
to
see
them
again
dowie
face
set
itself
in
lines
of
perfectly
correct
inexpressiveness
and
she
added
they
set
her
asking
me
questions
i
could
answer
and
she
broke
down
because
she
suddenly
understood
why
no
your
grace
she
not
known
those
of
her
own
age
she
is
of
the
ignorance
of
a
child
the
duchess
thought
it
out
slowly
she
thinks
not
poor
lamb
but
she
is
dowie
answered
the
duchess
eyes
met
hers
and
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
dowie
tried
to
retain
a
steadiness
and
the
duchess
observing
the
intention
knew
that
she
was
free
to
speak
lord
coombe
confided
to
me
that
she
had
passed
through
a
hideous
danger
which
had
made
a
lasting
impression
on
her
she
said
in
a
low
voice
he
told
me
because
he
felt
it
would
explain
certain
reserves
and
fears
in
her
sometimes
she
wakes
up
out
of
nightmares
about
it
said
dowie
and
she
creeps
into
my
room
shivering
and
i
take
her
into
my
bed
and
hold
her
in
my
arms
until
she
over
the
panic
she
says
the
worst
of
it
is
that
she
keeps
thinking
that
there
may
have
been
other
girls
trapped
like
her
and
that
they
did
not
get
away
the
duchess
was
very
thoughtful
she
saw
the
complications
in
which
such
a
horror
would
involve
a
girl
mind
if
she
consorted
with
other
young
things
and
talked
nonsense
with
them
and
shared
their
pleasures
she
would
forget
it
she
said
ah
exclaimed
dowie
that
it
the
question
in
the
duchess
eyes
when
she
lifted
them
required
an
answer
and
she
gave
it
respectfully
the
thing
that
happened
was
only
the
last
touch
put
to
what
gradually
been
finding
out
as
she
grew
from
child
to
young
girl
the
ones
she
would
like
to
know
she
said
it
in
plain
words
once
to
mademoiselle
might
not
want
to
know
her
i
must
take
the
liberty
of
speaking
plain
your
grace
or
it
no
use
me
speaking
at
all
she
holds
it
deep
in
her
mind
that
she
a
sort
of
young
outcast
i
must
convince
her
that
she
is
not
it
was
the
beginning
of
what
the
duchess
had
meant
to
say
but
she
actually
found
herself
pausing
held
for
the
moment
by
dowie
quiet
civil
eye
was
your
grace
in
your
kindness
thinking
was
what
the
excellent
woman
said
yes
that
i
would
invite
young
people
to
meet
her
help
them
to
know
each
other
and
to
make
friends
and
even
as
she
said
it
she
was
conscious
of
being
slightly
under
the
influence
of
wise
gaze
your
grace
only
knows
those
young
people
she
would
like
to
know
it
was
a
mere
simple
statement
people
are
not
as
censorious
as
they
once
were
her
grace
tone
was
intended
to
reply
to
the
suggestion
lying
in
the
words
which
had
worn
the
air
of
statement
without
comment
some
are
not
but
some
are
dowie
answered
there
two
worlds
in
london
now
your
grace
one
is
your
grace
and
one
is
i
have
heard
say
there
are
others
between
but
i
only
know
those
two
the
duchess
pondered
again
you
are
thinking
that
what
miss
robin
said
to
mademoiselle
valle
might
be
true
in
mine
and
perhaps
you
are
not
altogether
wrong
even
if
you
are
not
altogether
right
until
i
went
to
take
care
of
miss
robin
i
had
only
had
places
in
families
set
did
touch
anywhere
what
i
remembering
is
that
there
was
a
strictness
shown
sometimes
even
when
it
seemed
a
bit
harsh
among
the
servants
the
older
ones
said
that
is
was
because
of
the
new
sets
and
their
fast
wicked
ways
one
of
my
young
ladies
once
met
another
young
lady
about
her
own
age
she
was
just
fifteen
at
a
charity
bazaar
and
they
made
friends
and
liked
each
other
very
much
the
young
mother
was
one
there
was
a
lot
of
talk
about
in
connection
with
a
person
of
very
high
station
the
highest
your
grace
and
everyone
knew
the
girl
was
a
lovely
little
creature
and
beautifully
behaved
it
was
said
her
mother
wanted
to
push
her
into
the
world
she
could
get
into
herself
the
acquaintance
was
stopped
your
grace
it
was
put
a
stop
to
at
once
and
my
poor
little
young
lady
quite
broke
her
heart
over
it
and
i
heard
it
was
much
worse
for
the
other
i
will
think
this
over
the
duchess
said
it
needs
thinking
over
i
wished
to
talk
to
you
because
i
have
seen
that
she
has
fixed
little
ideas
regarding
what
she
thinks
is
suited
to
her
position
as
a
paid
companion
and
she
might
not
be
prepared
i
wish
you
to
see
that
she
has
a
pretty
little
frock
or
so
which
she
could
wear
if
she
required
them
she
has
two
your
grace
dowie
smiled
affectionately
as
she
said
it
one
for
evening
and
one
for
special
afternoon
wear
in
case
your
grace
needed
her
to
attend
you
for
some
reason
they
are
as
plain
as
she
dare
make
them
but
when
she
puts
one
on
she
help
giving
it
a
look
yes
she
would
give
it
all
it
needed
her
grace
said
thank
you
dowie
you
may
go
with
her
sketch
of
a
respectful
curtsey
dowie
went
towards
the
door
as
she
approached
it
her
step
became
slower
before
she
reached
it
she
had
stopped
and
there
was
a
remarkable
look
on
her
face
a
suddenly
heroic
look
she
turned
and
made
several
steps
backward
and
paused
again
which
unexpected
action
caused
the
duchess
to
turn
to
glance
at
her
when
she
glanced
her
grace
recognized
the
heroic
look
and
waited
with
a
consciousness
of
some
slight
new
emotion
within
herself
for
its
explanation
your
grace
dowie
began
asking
god
himself
to
give
courage
if
she
was
doing
right
and
to
check
her
if
she
was
making
a
mistake
when
your
grace
was
thinking
of
the
parents
of
other
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
did
it
come
to
you
to
put
it
to
yourself
whether
you
be
willing
she
caught
her
breath
but
ended
quite
clearly
respectfully
reasonably
lady
kathryn
lord
halwyn
lady
kathryn
was
the
duchess
young
granddaughter
lord
halwyn
was
her
extremely
grandson
who
was
in
the
army
the
duchess
understood
what
the
heroic
look
had
meant
and
her
respect
for
it
was
great
its
intention
had
not
been
to
suggest
inclusion
of
george
and
kathryn
in
her
pun
it
had
only
with
pure
justice
put
it
to
her
to
ask
herself
what
her
own
personal
decision
in
such
a
matter
would
be
you
do
feel
as
if
you
were
her
mother
she
said
and
you
are
a
practical
woman
it
is
only
if
i
myself
am
willing
to
take
such
a
step
that
i
have
a
right
to
ask
it
of
other
people
lady
lothwell
is
the
mother
i
must
speak
to
first
her
children
are
mine
though
i
am
a
mere
grandmother
lady
lothwell
was
her
daughter
and
though
she
was
not
regarded
as
victorian
either
of
the
early
or
the
middle
periods
dowie
as
she
returned
to
her
own
comfortable
quarters
wondered
what
would
happen
chapter
xxx
what
did
occur
was
not
at
all
complicated
it
would
not
have
been
possible
for
a
woman
to
have
spent
her
girlhood
with
the
cleverest
mother
of
her
day
and
have
emerged
from
her
training
either
obstinate
or
illogical
lady
lothwell
listened
to
as
much
of
the
history
of
robin
as
her
mother
chose
to
tell
her
and
plainly
felt
an
amiable
interest
in
it
she
knew
much
more
detail
and
gossip
concerning
than
the
duchess
herself
did
she
had
heard
of
the
child
who
was
kept
out
of
sight
and
she
had
been
somewhat
disgusted
by
a
vague
story
of
lord
coombe
abnormal
interest
in
it
and
the
ugly
hint
that
he
had
an
object
in
view
it
was
too
unpleasantly
morbid
to
be
true
of
a
man
her
mother
had
known
for
years
of
course
you
were
not
thinking
of
anything
large
or
formal
she
said
after
a
moment
of
smiling
hesitation
no
i
am
not
launching
a
girl
into
society
i
only
want
to
help
her
to
know
a
few
nice
young
people
who
are
and
she
is
not
the
ordinary
old
lady
companion
and
if
she
were
not
so
strict
with
herself
and
with
me
i
confess
i
should
behave
towards
her
very
much
as
i
should
behave
to
kathryn
if
you
could
spare
her
to
live
with
me
she
is
a
young
thing
because
i
am
known
to
have
one
of
my
eccentric
fancies
for
her
and
because
after
all
her
father
was
well
connected
her
present
position
will
not
be
the
obstacle
she
is
not
the
first
modern
girl
who
has
chosen
to
support
herself
but
is
she
much
too
pretty
much
but
she
does
flaunt
it
but
and
too
pretty
dearest
mamma
lady
lothwell
laughed
again
she
can
do
no
harm
to
kathryn
but
i
own
that
if
george
were
not
at
present
quite
madly
in
love
with
a
darling
being
at
least
fifteen
years
older
than
himself
i
should
pause
to
reflect
stacy
will
keep
him
steady
alan
stacy
you
know
the
one
with
the
magnificent
henna
hair
and
the
eyes
that
droop
no
boy
of
can
resist
her
they
call
her
adorers
infant
school
a
small
dinner
and
a
small
dance
and
george
and
kathryn
may
be
the
beginning
of
an
interesting
experiment
it
would
be
pretty
and
kind
of
you
to
drop
in
during
the
course
of
the
evening
are
you
hoping
to
perhaps
make
a
marriage
for
her
lady
lothwell
asked
the
question
a
shade
disturbedly
you
are
so
amazing
mamma
darling
that
i
know
you
will
do
it
if
you
believe
in
it
you
seem
to
be
able
to
cause
the
things
you
really
want
to
evolve
from
the
universe
she
is
the
kind
of
girl
whose
place
in
the
universe
is
in
the
home
of
some
young
man
whose
own
place
in
the
universe
is
in
the
heart
and
soul
and
life
of
her
kind
of
girl
they
ought
to
carry
out
the
will
of
god
by
falling
passionately
in
love
with
each
other
they
ought
to
marry
each
other
and
have
a
large
number
of
children
as
beautiful
and
rapturously
happy
as
themselves
they
would
assist
in
the
evolution
of
the
race
oh
mamma
how
delightful
you
always
are
for
a
really
brilliant
woman
you
are
the
most
adorable
dreamer
in
the
world
dreams
are
the
only
things
which
are
true
the
rest
are
nothing
but
visions
angel
her
daughter
laughed
a
little
adoringly
as
she
kissed
her
i
will
do
whatever
you
want
me
to
do
i
always
did
i
it
your
way
of
making
one
see
what
you
see
when
you
are
talking
that
does
it
it
was
understood
before
they
parted
that
kathryn
and
george
would
be
present
at
the
small
dinner
and
the
small
dance
and
that
a
few
other
agreeable
young
persons
might
be
trusted
to
join
them
and
that
lady
lothwell
and
perhaps
her
husband
would
drop
in
it
your
being
almost
early
victorian
mamma
which
makes
it
easy
for
you
to
initiate
things
you
will
initiate
little
miss
lawless
it
was
rather
neat
of
her
to
prefer
to
drop
the
there
has
been
less
talk
in
late
years
of
the
different
classes
their
places
and
classes
really
strikes
one
as
vulgar
we
may
our
places
the
duchess
said
we
may
hold
on
to
them
as
firmly
as
we
please
it
is
the
places
themselves
which
are
moving
my
dear
it
is
not
unlike
the
beginning
of
a
landslide
robin
went
to
dowie
room
the
next
evening
and
stood
a
moment
in
silence
watching
her
sewing
before
she
spoke
she
looked
anxious
and
even
pale
her
grace
is
going
to
give
a
party
to
some
young
people
dowie
she
said
she
wishes
me
to
be
present
i
i
do
know
what
to
do
what
you
must
do
my
dear
is
to
put
on
your
best
evening
frock
and
go
downstairs
and
enjoy
yourself
as
the
other
young
people
will
her
grace
wants
you
to
see
someone
your
own
age
was
answer
but
i
am
not
like
the
others
i
am
only
a
girl
earning
her
living
as
a
companion
how
do
i
know
her
grace
knows
dowie
said
and
what
she
asks
you
to
do
it
is
your
duty
to
do
and
do
it
prettily
robin
lost
even
a
shade
more
colour
do
you
realize
that
i
have
never
been
to
a
party
in
my
life
not
even
to
a
children
party
dowie
i
shall
not
know
how
to
behave
myself
you
know
how
to
talk
nicely
to
people
and
you
know
how
to
sit
down
and
rise
from
your
chair
and
move
about
a
room
like
a
quiet
young
lady
you
dance
like
a
fairy
you
wo
be
asked
to
do
anything
more
the
duchess
reflected
robin
aloud
slowly
would
not
let
me
come
downstairs
if
she
did
not
know
that
people
would
be
kind
lady
kathryn
and
lord
halwyn
are
coming
they
are
her
own
grandchildren
dowie
said
how
did
you
know
that
robin
inquired
robin
colour
began
to
come
back
it
not
what
usually
happens
to
girls
in
situations
she
said
her
grace
herself
is
what
usually
happens
said
dowie
there
is
no
one
like
her
for
high
wisdom
and
kindness
having
herself
awakened
to
the
truth
of
this
fact
robin
felt
herself
supported
by
it
one
knew
what
perception
and
clarity
of
experienced
vision
this
one
woman
had
gained
during
her
many
years
of
life
if
she
had
elected
to
do
this
thing
she
had
seen
her
path
clear
before
her
and
was
not
offering
a
gift
which
awkward
chance
might
spoil
or
snatch
away
from
the
hand
held
out
to
receive
it
a
curious
slow
warmth
began
to
creep
about
robin
heart
and
in
its
mounting
gradually
fill
her
being
it
was
true
she
had
been
taught
to
dance
to
move
about
and
speak
prettily
she
had
been
taught
a
great
many
things
which
seemed
to
be
very
carefully
instilled
into
her
mind
and
body
without
any
special
reason
she
had
not
been
aware
that
lord
coombe
and
mademoiselle
valle
had
directed
and
discussed
her
training
as
if
it
had
been
that
of
a
young
royal
person
whose
equipment
must
be
a
flawless
thing
if
the
dowager
duchess
of
darte
had
wished
to
present
her
at
court
some
fair
morning
she
would
have
known
the
length
of
the
train
she
must
wear
where
she
must
make
her
curtseys
and
to
whom
and
to
what
depth
how
to
kiss
the
royal
hand
and
how
to
manage
her
train
when
she
retired
from
the
presence
when
she
had
been
taught
this
she
had
asked
mademoiselle
valle
if
the
training
was
part
of
every
girl
education
and
mademoiselle
had
answered
it
is
best
to
know
everything
even
ceremonials
which
may
or
may
not
prove
of
use
it
all
forms
part
of
a
background
and
prevents
one
from
feeling
unfamiliar
with
customs
when
she
had
passed
the
young
pairs
in
the
streets
she
had
found
an
added
interest
in
them
because
of
this
background
she
could
imagine
them
dancing
together
in
fairy
ball
rooms
whose
lights
and
colours
her
imagination
was
obliged
to
construct
for
her
out
of
its
own
fabric
she
knew
what
the
girls
would
look
like
if
they
went
to
a
drawing
room
and
she
often
wondered
if
they
would
feel
shy
when
the
page
spread
out
their
lovely
peacock
tails
for
them
and
left
them
to
their
own
devices
it
was
mere
nature
that
she
should
have
pondered
and
pondered
and
sometimes
unconsciously
longed
to
feel
herself
part
of
the
flood
of
being
sweeping
past
her
as
she
stood
apart
on
the
brink
of
the
river
the
warmth
about
her
heart
made
it
beat
a
little
faster
she
opened
the
door
of
her
wardrobe
when
she
found
herself
in
her
bedroom
the
dress
hung
modestly
in
its
corner
shrouded
from
the
penetration
of
london
fogs
by
clean
sheeting
it
was
only
white
and
as
simple
as
she
knew
how
to
order
it
but
mademoiselle
had
taken
her
to
a
young
french
person
who
knew
exactly
what
she
was
doing
in
all
cases
and
because
the
girl
had
the
supple
lines
of
a
wood
nymph
and
the
eyes
of
young
antelope
she
had
evolved
that
which
expressed
her
as
a
petal
expresses
its
rose
robin
locked
her
door
and
took
the
dress
down
and
found
the
silk
stockings
and
slippers
which
belonged
to
it
she
put
them
all
on
standing
before
her
long
mirror
and
having
left
no
ungiven
last
touch
she
fell
a
few
steps
backward
and
looked
at
herself
turning
and
balancing
herself
as
a
bird
might
have
done
she
turned
lightly
round
and
round
yes
i
am
she
said
i
am
very
the
next
instant
she
laughed
at
herself
outright
how
silly
how
silly
she
said
almost
everybody
is
more
or
less
i
wonder
if
i
remember
the
new
steps
for
she
had
been
taught
the
new
steps
the
new
walking
and
swayings
and
pauses
and
sudden
swirls
and
swoops
and
her
new
dress
was
as
short
as
other
fashionable
girls
dresses
were
but
in
her
case
revealed
a
haunting
delicacy
of
contour
and
line
so
before
her
mirror
she
danced
alone
and
as
she
danced
her
lips
parted
and
her
breast
rose
and
fell
charmingly
and
her
eyes
lighted
and
glowed
as
any
girl
might
have
done
or
as
a
joyous
girl
nymph
might
have
lighted
as
she
danced
by
a
pool
in
her
forest
seeing
her
loveliness
mirrored
there
something
was
awakening
as
something
had
awakened
when
donal
had
kissed
a
child
under
the
soot
sprinkled
london
trees
chapter
xxxi
the
whole
day
before
the
party
was
secretly
exciting
to
robin
she
knew
how
much
more
important
it
seemed
to
her
than
it
really
was
if
she
had
been
six
years
old
she
might
have
felt
the
same
kind
of
uncertain
thrills
and
tremulous
wonders
she
hid
herself
behind
the
window
curtains
in
her
room
that
she
might
see
the
men
putting
up
the
crimson
and
white
awning
from
the
door
to
the
carriage
step
the
roll
of
red
carpet
they
took
from
their
van
had
a
magic
air
the
ringing
of
the
door
bell
which
meant
that
things
were
being
delivered
the
extra
moving
about
of
servants
the
florists
men
who
went
into
the
and
brought
flowers
and
big
tropical
plants
to
the
conservatory
and
fill
corners
which
were
not
always
decorated
each
and
every
one
of
them
quickened
the
beating
of
her
pulses
if
she
had
belonged
in
her
past
to
the
ordinary
cheerful
world
of
children
she
would
have
felt
by
this
time
no
such
elation
but
she
had
only
known
of
the
existence
of
such
festivities
as
children
parties
because
once
a
juvenile
ball
had
been
given
in
a
house
opposite
her
and
she
had
crouched
in
an
almost
delirious
little
heap
by
the
nursery
window
watching
carriages
drive
up
and
deposit
fluffy
pink
and
white
and
blue
children
upon
the
strip
of
red
carpet
and
had
seen
them
led
or
running
into
the
house
she
had
caught
sounds
of
strains
of
music
and
had
shivered
with
rapture
but
oh
what
worlds
away
from
her
the
party
had
been
she
found
her
way
into
the
which
were
not
usually
thrown
open
they
were
lofty
and
stately
and
seemed
to
her
immense
there
were
splendid
chandeliers
and
side
lights
which
she
thought
looked
as
if
they
would
hold
a
thousand
wax
candles
there
was
a
delightfully
embowered
corner
for
the
musicians
it
was
all
spacious
and
wonderful
in
its
beautiful
completeness
its
preparedness
for
pleasure
she
realized
that
all
of
it
had
always
been
waiting
to
be
used
for
the
happiness
of
people
who
knew
each
other
and
were
young
and
ready
for
delight
when
the
young
lothwells
had
been
children
they
had
had
dances
and
frolicking
games
with
other
children
in
the
huge
rooms
and
had
kicked
up
their
young
heels
on
the
polished
floors
at
christmas
parties
and
on
birthdays
how
wonderful
it
must
have
been
but
they
had
not
known
it
was
wonderful
as
dowie
dressed
her
the
reflection
she
saw
in
the
mirror
gave
back
to
her
an
intensified
robin
whose
curved
lips
almost
quivered
as
they
smiled
the
soft
silk
of
her
hair
looked
like
the
night
and
the
small
rings
on
the
back
of
her
very
slim
white
neck
were
things
to
ensnare
the
eye
and
hold
it
helpless
you
look
your
best
my
dear
dowie
said
as
she
clasped
her
little
necklace
and
it
is
a
good
best
dowie
was
feeling
tremulous
herself
though
she
could
not
have
explained
why
she
thought
that
perhaps
it
was
because
she
wished
that
mademoiselle
could
have
been
with
her
robin
kissed
her
when
the
last
touch
had
been
given
i
going
to
run
down
the
staircase
she
said
if
i
let
myself
walk
slowly
i
shall
have
time
to
feel
queer
and
shy
and
i
might
seem
to
creep
into
the
i
must
creep
in
i
must
walk
in
as
if
i
had
been
to
parties
all
my
life
she
ran
down
and
as
she
did
so
she
looked
like
a
white
bird
flying
but
she
was
obliged
to
stop
upon
the
landing
before
the
door
to
quiet
a
moment
of
excited
breathing
still
when
she
entered
the
room
she
moved
as
she
should
and
held
her
head
poised
with
a
delicately
fearless
air
the
duchess
who
herself
looked
her
best
in
her
fine
old
ivory
profiled
way
gave
her
a
pleased
smile
of
welcome
which
was
almost
affectionate
what
a
perfect
little
frock
she
said
you
are
delightfully
pretty
in
it
is
it
quite
right
said
robin
mademoiselle
chose
it
for
me
it
is
quite
right
right
george
would
say
george
will
sit
near
you
at
dinner
he
is
my
grandson
lord
halwyn
you
know
and
you
will
no
doubt
frequently
hear
him
say
things
are
something
or
other
during
the
evening
kathryn
will
say
things
are
or
i
mention
it
because
you
may
not
know
that
she
means
and
do
let
it
frighten
you
if
you
do
quite
understand
their
language
they
are
dear
handsome
things
sweeping
along
in
the
rush
of
their
bit
of
century
i
do
let
it
frighten
me
that
their
world
seems
to
me
an
entirely
new
planet
robin
drew
a
little
nearer
her
she
felt
something
as
she
had
felt
years
ago
when
she
had
said
to
dowie
i
want
to
kiss
you
dowie
her
eyes
were
pools
of
childish
tenderness
because
she
so
well
understood
the
infinitude
of
the
friendly
tact
which
drew
her
within
its
own
circle
with
the
light
humour
of
its
i
let
them
frighten
me
you
are
kind
kind
to
me
she
said
and
i
am
grateful
grateful
the
extremely
young
people
who
began
very
soon
to
drift
into
the
brilliant
big
room
singly
or
in
pairs
of
brother
and
sister
filled
her
with
innocent
delight
they
were
so
well
built
and
gaily
at
ease
with
each
other
and
their
surroundings
so
perfectly
dressed
and
finished
the
filmy
narrowness
of
delicate
frocks
the
shortness
of
skirts
accentuated
the
youth
and
girlhood
and
added
to
it
a
sort
of
child
kathryn
in
exquisite
wisps
of
gauze
looked
fourteen
instead
of
nearly
twenty
aided
by
a
dimple
in
her
cheek
and
a
small
tilted
nose
a
girl
in
scarlet
tulle
was
like
a
child
out
of
a
nursery
ready
to
dance
about
a
christmas
tree
everyone
seemed
so
young
and
so
suggested
supple
dancing
perhaps
because
dancing
was
going
on
everywhere
and
all
the
world
whether
fashionable
or
unfashionable
was
driven
by
a
passion
for
whirling
swooping
and
inventing
new
postures
and
fantastic
steps
the
young
men
had
slim
straight
bodies
and
light
movements
their
clothes
fitted
their
suppleness
to
perfection
robin
thought
they
all
looked
as
if
they
had
had
a
great
deal
of
delightful
exercise
and
plenty
of
pleasure
all
their
lives
they
were
of
that
stream
which
had
always
seemed
to
be
rushing
past
her
in
bright
pursuit
of
alluring
things
which
belonged
to
them
as
part
of
their
existence
but
which
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
own
youth
now
the
stream
had
paused
as
if
she
had
for
the
moment
some
connection
with
it
the
swift
light
she
was
used
to
seeing
illuminate
glancing
eyes
as
she
passed
people
in
the
street
she
saw
again
and
again
as
new
arrivals
appeared
kathryn
was
quite
excited
by
her
eyes
and
eyelashes
and
george
hovered
about
there
was
a
great
deal
of
hovering
at
the
dinner
table
sleek
young
heads
held
themselves
at
an
angle
which
allowed
of
their
owners
seeing
through
or
around
or
under
floral
decorations
and
alert
young
eyes
showed
an
eager
gleam
after
dinner
was
over
and
dancing
began
the
duchess
smiled
shrewdly
as
she
saw
the
gravitating
masculine
movement
towards
a
certain
point
it
was
the
point
where
robin
stood
with
a
small
growing
circle
about
her
it
was
george
who
danced
with
her
first
he
was
tall
and
slender
and
flexible
and
his
good
shoulders
had
a
military
squareness
of
build
he
had
also
a
nice
square
face
and
a
warmly
blue
eye
and
knew
all
the
latest
steps
and
curves
and
unexpected
swirls
robin
was
an
ozier
wand
and
there
was
no
swoop
or
dart
or
sudden
sway
and
change
she
was
not
alert
at
the
swing
and
lure
of
the
music
the
swift
movement
the
fluttering
of
airy
draperies
as
slim
sister
nymphs
flew
past
her
set
her
pulses
beating
with
sweet
young
joy
a
brief
uncontrollable
ripple
of
laughter
broke
from
her
before
she
had
circled
the
room
twice
how
heavenly
it
is
she
exclaimed
and
lifted
her
eyes
to
halwyn
how
heavenly
they
were
not
safe
eyes
to
lift
in
such
a
way
to
those
of
a
very
young
man
they
gave
george
a
sudden
enjoyable
shock
he
had
heard
of
the
girl
who
was
a
sort
of
sublimated
companion
to
his
grandmother
the
duchess
herself
had
talked
to
him
a
little
about
her
and
he
had
come
to
the
party
intending
to
behave
very
amiably
and
help
the
little
thing
enjoy
herself
he
had
also
encountered
before
in
houses
where
there
were
no
daughters
the
smart
young
companion
who
was
allowed
all
sorts
of
privileges
because
she
knew
how
to
assume
tiresome
little
responsibilities
and
how
to
be
entertaining
enough
to
add
cheer
and
spice
to
the
life
of
the
elderly
and
lonely
sometimes
she
was
a
subtly
appealing
sort
of
girl
and
given
to
being
sympathetic
and
to
liking
sympathy
and
quiet
corners
in
conservatories
or
libraries
and
sometimes
she
was
capable
of
scientific
flirtation
and
required
scientific
management
a
man
had
to
have
his
wits
about
him
this
one
as
she
flew
like
a
blown
leaf
across
the
floor
and
laughed
up
into
his
face
with
wide
eyes
produced
a
new
effect
and
was
a
new
kind
it
you
who
are
heavenly
he
answered
with
a
boy
laugh
you
are
like
a
feather
and
a
willow
wand
you
are
light
too
she
laughed
back
and
you
are
like
steel
as
well
alan
stacy
the
lady
with
the
magnificent
henna
hair
had
recently
given
less
time
to
him
being
engaged
in
the
preliminary
instruction
of
a
new
member
of
the
infant
class
such
things
will
of
course
happen
and
though
george
had
quite
ingenuously
raged
in
secret
the
circumstances
left
him
free
to
hover
and
hovering
was
a
pastime
he
enjoyed
let
us
go
on
like
this
forever
and
ever
he
said
sweeping
half
the
length
of
the
room
with
her
and
whirling
her
as
if
she
were
indeed
a
leaf
in
the
wind
forever
and
ever
i
wish
we
could
but
the
music
will
stop
she
gave
back
music
ought
never
to
stop
never
he
answered
but
the
music
did
stop
and
when
it
began
again
almost
immediately
another
tall
flexible
young
man
made
a
lightning
claim
on
her
and
carried
her
away
only
to
hand
her
to
another
and
he
in
his
turn
to
another
she
was
not
allowed
more
than
a
moment
rest
and
borne
on
the
crest
of
the
wave
of
young
delight
she
did
not
need
more
young
eyes
were
always
laughing
into
hers
and
elating
her
by
a
special
look
of
pleasure
in
everything
she
did
or
said
or
inspired
in
themselves
how
was
she
informed
without
phrases
that
for
this
exciting
evening
she
was
a
creature
without
a
flaw
that
the
loveliness
of
her
eyes
startled
those
who
looked
into
them
that
it
was
a
thrilling
experience
to
dance
with
her
that
somehow
she
was
new
and
apart
and
wonderful
no
slim
and
youth
said
exactly
any
of
these
things
to
her
but
somehow
they
were
conveyed
and
filled
her
with
a
wondering
realization
of
the
fact
that
if
they
were
true
they
were
no
longer
dreadful
and
maddening
since
they
only
made
people
like
and
want
to
dance
with
one
to
dance
to
like
people
and
be
liked
seemed
so
heavenly
natural
and
right
to
be
only
like
air
and
sky
and
free
happy
breathing
there
was
it
was
true
a
blissful
little
uplifted
look
about
her
which
she
herself
was
not
aware
of
but
which
was
singularly
stimulating
to
the
masculine
beholder
it
only
meant
indeed
that
as
she
whirled
and
swayed
and
swooped
laughing
she
was
saying
to
herself
at
intervals
this
is
what
other
girls
feel
like
they
are
happy
like
this
i
am
laughing
and
talking
to
people
just
as
other
girls
do
i
am
robin
but
i
am
enjoying
a
party
like
this
a
young
party
lady
lothwell
sitting
near
her
mother
watched
the
trend
of
affairs
with
an
occasional
queer
interested
smile
well
mamma
darling
she
said
at
last
as
youth
and
beauty
whirled
by
in
a
maelstrom
of
modern
terpsichorean
liveliness
she
is
a
great
success
i
do
know
whether
it
is
quite
what
you
intended
or
not
the
duchess
did
not
explain
what
she
had
intended
she
was
watching
the
trend
also
and
thinking
a
good
deal
on
the
whole
lady
lothwell
had
scarcely
expected
that
she
would
explain
she
rarely
did
she
seldom
made
mistakes
however
kathryn
in
her
scant
gauzy
strips
of
white
and
silver
having
drifted
towards
them
at
the
moment
stood
looking
on
with
a
funny
little
disturbed
expression
on
her
small
face
there
something
about
her
grandmamma
she
said
all
the
girls
see
it
and
no
one
knows
what
it
is
she
sitting
out
for
a
few
minutes
and
just
look
at
george
and
hal
brunton
and
captain
willys
they
are
all
laughing
of
course
and
pretending
to
joke
but
they
would
like
to
eat
each
other
up
perhaps
her
eyelashes
she
looks
out
from
under
them
as
if
they
were
a
curtain
lady
lothwell
queer
little
smile
became
a
queer
little
laugh
yes
it
gives
her
a
look
of
being
ecstatically
happy
and
yet
almost
shy
and
appealing
at
the
same
time
men
ca
stand
it
of
course
none
of
them
are
trying
to
stand
it
answered
little
lady
kathryn
somewhat
in
the
tone
of
a
retort
i
do
believe
she
knows
she
does
it
lady
lothwell
said
quite
reflectively
she
does
not
know
at
all
that
is
the
worst
of
it
commented
the
duchess
then
you
see
that
there
is
a
worst
said
her
daughter
the
duchess
glanced
towards
kathryn
but
fortunately
the
puzzled
fret
of
the
girl
forehead
was
even
at
the
moment
melting
into
a
smile
as
a
young
man
of
much
attraction
descended
upon
her
with
smiles
of
his
own
and
carried
her
into
the
tango
or
fox
trot
or
antelope
galop
whichsoever
it
chanced
to
be
if
she
were
really
aware
of
it
that
would
be
worst
for
other
people
for
us
probably
she
could
look
out
from
under
her
lashes
to
sufficient
purpose
to
call
what
she
wanted
and
take
and
keep
it
as
she
is
not
aware
it
will
make
things
less
easy
for
herself
under
the
circumstances
the
circumstance
of
being
daughter
is
not
an
agreeable
one
said
lady
lothwell
it
might
give
some
adventurous
boys
ideas
when
they
had
time
to
realize
all
it
means
do
you
know
i
am
rather
sorry
for
her
myself
i
should
be
surprised
if
she
were
rather
a
dear
little
thing
she
looks
tender
and
perhaps
she
is
like
the
heroine
of
a
sentimental
novel
i
read
the
other
day
her
chief
slave
said
of
her
walks
into
a
man
heart
through
his
eyes
and
sits
down
there
and
makes
a
warm
place
which
will
never
get
cold
again
rather
nice
i
thought
the
duchess
thought
it
rather
nice
also
get
cold
again
she
repeated
what
a
heavenly
thing
to
happen
to
a
pair
of
creatures
if
she
paused
and
regarded
robin
who
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
was
trying
to
decide
some
parlous
question
of
dances
to
which
there
was
more
than
one
claimant
she
was
sweetly
puckering
her
brow
over
her
card
and
round
her
were
youthful
male
faces
looking
eager
and
even
a
trifle
tense
with
repressed
anxiety
for
the
victory
of
the
moment
oh
lady
lothwell
laughed
as
kitty
says
something
about
her
and
it
not
mere
eyelashes
you
have
let
loose
a
germ
among
us
mamma
my
sweet
and
you
ca
do
anything
with
a
germ
when
you
have
let
it
loose
to
quote
kitty
again
at
george
the
music
which
came
from
the
bower
behind
which
the
musicians
were
hidden
seemed
to
gain
thrill
and
wildness
as
the
hours
went
on
as
the
rooms
grew
warmer
the
flowers
breathed
out
more
reaching
scent
now
and
again
robin
paused
for
a
moment
to
listen
to
strange
delightful
chords
and
to
inhale
passing
waves
of
something
like
mignonette
and
lilies
and
apple
blossoms
in
the
sun
she
thought
there
must
be
some
flower
which
was
like
all
three
in
one
the
rushing
stream
was
carrying
her
with
it
as
it
went
one
of
the
happy
petals
on
its
surface
could
it
ever
cast
her
aside
and
leave
her
on
the
shore
again
while
the
violins
went
singing
on
and
the
thousand
wax
candles
shone
on
the
faint
or
vivid
colours
which
mingled
into
a
sort
of
lovely
haze
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
a
thing
so
enchanting
and
so
real
could
have
an
end
at
all
all
the
other
things
in
her
life
seemed
less
real
tonight
in
the
conservatory
there
was
a
marble
fountain
which
had
long
years
ago
been
brought
from
a
palace
garden
in
rome
it
was
not
as
large
as
it
was
beautiful
and
it
had
been
placed
among
palms
and
tropic
ferns
whose
leaves
and
fronds
it
splashed
merrily
among
and
kept
deliciously
cool
and
there
was
a
quite
intoxicating
perfume
of
warm
damp
moss
and
massed
flowers
and
it
was
the
kind
of
corner
any
young
man
would
feel
it
necessary
to
gravitate
towards
with
a
partner
george
led
robin
to
it
and
she
naturally
sat
upon
the
edge
of
the
marble
basin
and
as
naturally
drew
off
a
glove
and
dipped
her
hand
into
the
water
splashing
it
a
little
because
it
felt
deliciously
cool
george
stood
near
at
first
and
looked
down
at
her
bent
head
it
was
impossible
not
also
to
take
in
her
small
fine
ear
and
the
warm
velvet
white
of
the
lovely
little
nape
of
her
slim
neck
he
took
them
in
with
elated
appreciation
he
was
not
subtle
minded
enough
to
be
aware
that
her
reply
to
a
casual
remark
he
had
made
to
her
at
dinner
had
had
a
remote
effect
upon
him
one
of
the
loveliest
creatures
i
ever
saw
was
a
he
had
said
are
you
related
to
her
i
am
her
daughter
robin
had
answered
and
with
a
slightly
startled
sensation
he
had
managed
to
slip
into
amiably
deft
generalities
while
he
had
secretly
wondered
how
much
his
grandmother
knew
or
did
not
know
an
involuntary
thought
of
feather
had
crossed
his
mind
once
or
twice
during
the
evening
this
was
the
girl
who
it
was
said
had
actually
been
saved
up
for
old
coombe
ugly
morbid
sort
of
idea
if
it
was
true
how
had
the
duchess
got
hold
of
her
and
why
and
what
was
coombe
really
up
to
could
he
have
some
elderly
idea
of
wanting
a
youngster
for
a
wife
occasionally
an
old
chap
did
serve
him
right
if
some
young
chap
took
the
wind
out
of
his
sails
he
was
not
a
desperate
character
but
he
had
been
very
intimate
with
alan
stacy
and
her
friends
and
it
had
made
him
careless
also
robin
had
drawn
him
drawn
him
more
than
he
knew
is
it
still
heavenly
he
asked
how
pointed
her
fingers
were
and
how
soft
and
crushable
her
hand
looked
as
it
splashed
like
a
child
more
heavenly
every
minute
she
answered
he
laughed
outright
the
heavenly
thing
is
the
way
you
are
enjoying
it
yourself
i
never
saw
a
girl
light
up
a
whole
room
before
you
throw
out
stars
as
you
dance
that
like
a
skyrocket
robin
laughed
back
and
it
because
in
all
my
life
i
never
went
to
a
dance
before
never
you
mean
except
to
children
parties
there
were
no
children
parties
this
is
the
first
first
first
well
i
do
see
how
that
happened
but
i
am
glad
it
did
because
it
been
a
great
thing
for
me
to
see
you
at
your
first
first
first
he
sat
down
on
the
fountain
edge
near
her
i
shall
not
forget
it
he
said
i
shall
remember
it
as
long
as
i
live
said
robin
and
she
lifted
her
unsafe
eyes
again
and
smiled
into
his
which
made
them
still
more
unsafe
perhaps
it
was
because
he
was
extremely
young
perhaps
it
was
because
he
was
immoral
perhaps
because
he
had
never
held
a
tight
rein
on
his
fleeting
emotions
even
the
next
moment
he
felt
that
it
was
because
he
was
an
idiot
but
suddenly
he
found
he
had
let
himself
go
and
was
kissing
the
warm
velvet
of
the
slim
little
nape
had
kissed
it
twice
he
had
not
given
himself
time
to
think
what
would
happen
as
a
result
but
what
did
happen
was
humiliating
and
ridiculous
one
furious
splash
of
the
curled
hand
flung
water
into
his
face
and
eyes
and
mouth
while
robin
tore
herself
free
from
him
and
stood
blazing
with
fury
and
woe
for
it
was
not
only
fury
he
saw
you
you
she
cried
and
actually
would
have
swooped
to
the
fountain
again
if
he
had
not
caught
her
arm
he
was
furious
himself
at
himself
and
at
her
you
little
fool
he
gasped
what
did
you
do
that
for
even
if
i
was
a
jackass
there
was
nothing
in
it
you
so
pretty
you
spoiled
everything
she
flamed
everything
everything
i
spoiled
nothing
i
only
been
a
fool
and
it
your
own
fault
for
being
so
pretty
you
spoiled
everything
in
the
world
now
with
a
desolate
horrible
little
sob
now
i
can
only
go
back
back
he
had
a
queer
idea
that
she
spoke
as
if
she
were
cinderella
and
he
had
made
the
clock
strike
twelve
her
voice
had
such
absolute
grief
in
it
that
he
involuntarily
drew
near
her
i
say
he
was
really
breathless
do
speak
like
that
i
beg
pardon
i
grovel
do
oh
kathryn
come
here
this
last
because
at
this
difficult
moment
from
between
the
banks
of
bloom
and
round
the
big
palms
his
sister
kathryn
suddenly
appeared
she
immediately
stopped
short
and
stared
at
them
both
looking
from
one
to
the
other
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
oh
come
and
talk
to
her
george
broke
forth
i
feel
as
if
she
might
scream
in
a
minute
and
call
everybody
in
i
been
a
lunatic
and
she
has
apparently
never
been
kissed
before
tell
her
tell
her
you
been
kissed
yourself
a
queer
little
look
revealed
itself
in
kathryn
face
a
delicate
vein
of
her
grandmother
wisdom
made
part
of
her
outlook
upon
a
rapidly
moving
and
exciting
world
she
had
never
been
or
dull
and
for
a
slight
gauzy
white
and
silver
thing
she
was
astute
do
be
impudent
she
said
to
george
as
she
walked
up
to
robin
and
put
a
cool
hand
on
her
arm
he
only
been
silly
you
better
let
him
off
she
said
she
turned
a
glance
on
george
who
was
wiping
his
sleeve
with
a
handkerchief
and
she
broke
into
a
small
laugh
did
she
push
you
into
the
fountain
she
asked
cheerfully
she
threw
the
fountain
at
me
grumbled
george
i
shall
have
to
dash
off
home
and
change
i
would
replied
kathryn
still
cheerful
you
can
apologize
better
when
you
dry
he
slid
through
the
palms
like
a
snake
and
the
two
girls
stood
and
gazed
at
each
other
robin
flame
had
died
down
and
her
face
had
settled
itself
into
a
sort
of
hardness
kathryn
did
not
know
that
she
herself
looked
at
her
as
the
duchess
might
have
looked
at
another
girl
in
the
quite
different
days
of
her
youth
i
tell
you
something
now
he
gone
she
said
i
have
been
kissed
myself
and
so
have
other
girls
i
know
boys
like
george
do
really
matter
though
of
course
it
bad
manners
but
who
has
got
good
manners
things
rush
so
that
there
scarcely
time
for
manners
at
all
when
an
older
man
makes
a
snatch
at
you
sometimes
detestable
but
to
push
him
into
the
fountain
was
a
good
idea
and
she
laughed
again
i
did
push
him
in
i
wish
you
had
with
a
gleeful
mischief
the
next
moment
however
the
hint
of
a
worried
frown
showed
itself
on
her
forehead
you
see
she
said
protestingly
you
are
so
frightfully
pretty
i
rather
be
a
leper
robin
shot
forth
but
kathryn
did
not
of
course
understand
what
nonsense
she
answered
what
utter
rubbish
you
know
you
would
come
back
to
the
ball
room
i
came
here
because
my
mother
was
asking
for
george
she
turned
to
lead
the
way
through
the
banked
flowers
and
as
she
did
so
added
something
by
the
way
somebody
important
has
been
assassinated
in
one
of
the
balkan
countries
they
are
always
assassinating
people
they
like
it
lord
coombe
has
just
come
in
and
is
talking
it
over
with
grandmamma
i
can
see
they
are
quite
excited
in
their
quiet
way
as
they
neared
the
entrance
to
the
ball
room
she
paused
a
moment
with
a
new
kind
of
impish
smile
every
girl
in
the
room
is
absolutely
shaky
with
thrills
at
this
particular
moment
she
said
and
every
man
feels
himself
bristling
a
little
the
very
best
looking
boy
in
all
england
is
dancing
with
sara
studleigh
he
dropped
in
by
chance
to
call
and
the
duchess
made
him
stay
he
is
a
kind
of
miracle
of
good
looks
and
takingness
robin
said
nothing
she
had
plainly
not
been
interested
in
the
balkan
tragedy
and
she
as
obviously
did
not
care
for
the
miracle
you
do
ask
who
he
is
said
kathryn
i
do
want
to
know
oh
come
you
must
feel
as
sulky
as
that
you
want
to
ask
questions
the
moment
you
see
him
i
did
everyone
does
his
name
is
donal
muir
he
lord
coombe
heir
he
be
the
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
some
day
here
he
comes
quite
excitedly
look
it
was
one
of
the
tricks
of
chance
or
fate
or
whatever
you
will
the
dance
brought
him
within
a
few
feet
of
them
at
that
very
moment
and
the
slow
walking
steps
he
was
taking
held
him
they
were
some
of
the
queer
stealthy
almost
stationary
steps
of
the
argentine
tango
he
was
finely
and
smoothly
fitted
as
the
other
youngsters
were
his
blond
glossed
head
was
set
high
on
a
heroic
column
of
neck
he
was
broad
of
shoulder
but
not
too
broad
slim
of
waist
but
not
too
slim
long
and
strong
of
leg
but
light
and
supple
and
firm
he
had
a
fair
open
brow
and
a
curved
mouth
laughing
to
show
white
teeth
robin
felt
he
ought
to
wear
a
kilt
and
plaid
and
that
an
eagle
feather
ought
to
be
standing
up
from
a
bonnet
on
the
fair
hair
which
would
have
waved
if
it
had
been
allowed
length
enough
he
was
scarcely
two
yards
from
her
now
and
suddenly
almost
as
if
he
had
been
called
he
turned
his
eyes
away
from
sara
studleigh
who
was
the
little
thing
in
christmas
tree
scarlet
they
were
blue
like
the
clear
water
in
a
tarn
when
the
sun
shines
on
it
and
they
were
still
laughing
as
his
mouth
was
straight
into
hers
they
laughed
straight
into
hers
chapter
xxxii
through
all
aeons
since
all
the
worlds
were
made
it
is
at
least
not
unthinkable
that
in
all
the
worlds
of
which
our
own
atom
is
one
there
has
ruled
a
force
illimitable
unconquerable
and
inexplicable
and
whichsoever
its
world
and
whatsoever
the
sign
denoting
or
the
name
given
it
the
force
the
thing
has
been
the
same
upon
our
own
atom
of
the
universe
it
is
given
the
generic
name
of
love
and
its
existence
is
that
which
the
boldest
need
not
defy
the
most
profound
need
not
attempt
to
explain
with
clarity
the
most
brilliantly
sophistical
to
argue
away
its
forms
of
beauty
triviality
magnificence
imbecility
loveliness
stupidity
holiness
purity
and
bestiality
neither
detract
from
nor
add
to
its
unalterable
power
as
the
earth
revolves
upon
its
axis
and
reveals
night
and
day
spring
summer
and
winter
so
it
reveals
this
ceaselessly
working
force
men
who
were
as
gods
have
been
uplifted
or
broken
by
it
fools
have
trifled
with
it
brutes
have
sullied
it
saints
have
worshipped
poets
sung
and
wits
derided
it
as
electricity
is
a
force
death
dealing
or
illuminating
and
power
bestowing
so
is
this
great
impeller
and
it
is
fatuous
howsoever
worldly
wise
or
moderately
sardonic
one
would
choose
to
be
to
hint
ironically
that
its
proportions
are
less
than
the
ages
have
proved
them
whether
a
world
formed
without
a
necessity
for
the
presence
and
assistance
of
this
psychological
factor
would
have
been
a
better
or
a
worse
one
it
is
by
good
fortune
not
here
imperative
that
one
should
attempt
to
decide
what
is
exists
none
of
us
created
it
each
one
will
deal
with
the
impeller
as
he
himself
either
sanely
or
madly
elects
he
will
also
bear
the
consequences
and
so
also
may
others
of
this
force
the
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
and
his
old
friend
knew
much
and
had
often
spoken
to
each
other
they
had
both
been
accustomed
to
recognizing
its
signs
subtle
or
crude
and
watching
their
development
they
had
seen
it
in
the
eyes
of
creatures
young
enough
to
be
called
boys
and
girls
they
had
heard
it
in
musical
laughter
and
in
silly
giggles
they
had
seen
it
express
itself
in
tragedy
and
comedy
and
watched
it
end
in
union
or
in
a
nothingness
which
melted
away
like
a
wisp
of
fog
but
they
knew
it
was
a
thing
omnipresent
and
that
no
one
passed
through
life
untouched
by
it
in
some
degree
years
before
this
evening
two
children
playing
in
a
garden
had
not
know
that
the
power
the
thing
drew
them
with
its
greatest
strength
because
among
myriads
of
atoms
they
two
were
created
for
oneness
enraptured
and
unaware
they
played
together
their
souls
and
bodies
drawn
nearer
each
other
every
hour
so
it
was
that
without
being
portentous
one
may
say
that
when
an
unusually
beautiful
and
unusually
well
dressed
and
perfectly
fitted
young
man
turned
involuntarily
in
the
particular
london
ball
room
in
which
daughter
watched
the
dancers
and
looked
unintentionally
into
the
eyes
of
a
girl
standing
for
a
moment
near
the
wide
entrance
doors
the
inexplicable
and
unconquerable
force
reconnected
its
currents
again
donal
muir
eyes
only
widened
a
little
for
a
second
time
he
had
not
known
why
he
had
suddenly
looked
around
and
he
did
not
know
why
he
was
conscious
of
something
which
startled
him
a
little
you
could
not
actually
stare
at
a
girl
because
your
eyes
chanced
to
get
entangled
in
hers
for
a
second
as
you
danced
past
her
it
was
true
she
was
of
a
startling
prettiness
and
there
was
something
yes
there
was
something
which
drew
the
eye
and
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
it
had
actually
given
him
a
sort
of
electric
shock
he
laughed
at
himself
a
little
and
then
his
open
brow
looked
puzzled
for
a
moment
you
saw
miss
lawless
said
sara
studleigh
who
was
at
the
moment
dancing
prettily
with
him
she
was
guilty
of
something
which
might
have
been
called
a
slight
giggle
but
it
was
i
know
you
saw
miss
lawless
the
pretty
one
near
the
door
there
are
so
many
pretty
ones
near
everything
you
ca
lift
your
eyes
without
seeing
one
donal
answered
what
a
lot
of
them
the
sense
of
having
received
a
slight
electric
shock
made
you
feel
that
you
must
look
again
and
find
out
what
had
caused
it
he
was
thinking
she
is
the
one
with
the
eyelashes
i
have
eyelashes
so
have
you
looking
down
at
hers
with
a
very
taking
expression
hers
were
in
fact
nice
ones
but
ours
are
not
two
inches
long
and
they
do
make
a
big
soft
circle
round
our
eyes
when
we
look
at
anyone
please
look
up
and
let
me
see
said
donal
when
i
asked
you
to
dance
with
me
i
thought
what
a
way
he
had
sara
studleigh
was
thinking
but
perhaps
it
was
the
eyelashes
was
passing
through
donal
mind
very
noticeable
eyelashes
were
rather
arresting
i
knew
you
saw
her
said
sara
studleigh
because
i
have
happened
to
be
near
two
or
three
people
this
evening
when
they
caught
their
first
sight
of
her
what
happens
to
them
asked
donal
muir
they
forget
where
they
are
she
laughed
and
do
say
anything
for
a
few
seconds
i
should
not
want
to
forget
where
i
am
it
would
be
possible
either
answered
donal
but
that
was
it
he
thought
for
a
minute
i
forgot
one
should
not
dance
with
one
girl
and
talk
to
her
about
another
wisely
he
led
her
to
other
subjects
the
music
was
swinging
through
the
air
performing
its
everlasting
miracle
of
swinging
young
souls
and
pulses
with
it
the
warmed
flowers
breathed
more
perceptible
scent
sweet
chatter
and
laughter
swaying
colour
and
glowing
eyes
concentrated
in
making
magic
this
beautiful
young
man
pulses
only
beat
with
the
rest
as
one
with
the
pulse
of
the
universe
lady
lothwell
acting
for
the
duchess
was
very
kind
to
him
finding
him
another
partner
as
soon
as
a
new
dance
began
this
time
her
own
daughter
lady
kathryn
even
while
he
had
been
tangoing
with
sara
studleigh
he
had
seen
the
girl
with
the
eyelashes
whirling
about
with
someone
and
when
he
began
his
dance
with
kathryn
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
almost
immediately
kathryn
spoke
of
her
i
do
know
when
you
will
get
a
dance
with
miss
lawless
she
said
she
is
obliged
to
work
out
mathematical
problems
on
her
programme
i
have
a
setter
who
fixes
his
eyes
on
you
and
waits
without
moving
until
you
look
at
him
and
then
he
makes
a
dart
and
obliged
to
pat
him
he
said
perhaps
if
i
go
and
stand
near
her
and
do
that
she
will
take
notice
of
me
take
notice
of
him
the
enslaving
thing
thought
kathryn
jump
for
all
her
talk
about
lepers
any
girl
would
he
too
nice
there
something
about
him
too
robin
did
not
jump
she
had
no
time
to
do
it
because
one
dance
followed
another
so
quickly
and
some
of
them
were
even
divided
in
two
or
three
pieces
but
the
thrill
of
the
singing
sound
of
the
violins
behind
the
greenery
the
perfume
and
stately
spaces
and
thousand
candlelights
had
suddenly
been
lifted
on
to
another
plane
though
she
had
thought
they
could
reach
no
higher
one
her
whole
being
was
a
keen
fine
awareness
every
moment
she
was
aware
after
all
the
years
from
the
far
away
days
he
had
come
back
no
one
had
dreamed
of
the
queer
half
abnormal
secret
she
had
always
kept
to
herself
as
a
child
as
a
little
girl
as
a
bigger
one
when
she
would
have
died
rather
than
divulge
that
in
her
loneliness
there
had
been
something
she
had
remembered
something
she
had
held
on
to
a
memory
which
she
had
actually
made
a
companion
of
making
pictures
telling
herself
stories
in
the
dark
even
inventing
conversations
which
not
for
one
moment
had
she
thought
would
or
could
ever
take
place
but
they
had
been
living
things
to
her
and
her
one
near
warm
comfort
closer
oh
so
weirdly
closer
than
kind
kind
dowie
and
dearly
beloved
mademoiselle
she
had
wondered
if
the
two
would
have
disapproved
if
they
had
known
if
mademoiselle
would
have
been
shocked
if
she
had
realized
that
sometimes
when
they
walked
together
there
walked
with
them
a
growing
laughing
boy
in
a
swinging
kilt
and
plaid
and
that
he
had
a
voice
and
eyes
that
drew
the
heart
out
of
your
breast
for
joy
at
first
he
had
only
been
a
child
like
herself
but
as
she
had
grown
he
had
grown
with
her
but
always
taller
grander
marvellously
masculine
and
beyond
compare
yet
never
once
had
she
dared
to
believe
or
hope
that
he
could
take
form
before
her
eyes
a
living
thing
he
had
only
been
the
shadow
she
had
loved
and
which
could
not
be
taken
away
from
her
because
he
was
her
secret
and
no
one
could
ever
know
the
music
went
swinging
and
singing
with
notes
which
were
almost
a
pain
and
he
was
in
the
very
room
with
her
donal
donal
he
had
not
known
and
did
not
know
he
had
laughed
into
her
eyes
without
knowing
but
he
had
come
back
a
young
man
now
like
all
the
rest
but
more
beautiful
what
a
laugh
what
wonderful
shoulders
what
wonderful
dancing
how
long
and
strongly
smooth
and
supple
he
was
in
the
line
fabric
of
his
clothes
though
her
mind
did
not
form
these
things
in
words
for
her
it
was
only
that
her
eyes
saw
all
the
charm
of
him
from
head
to
foot
and
told
her
that
he
was
only
more
than
ever
what
he
had
been
in
the
miraculous
first
days
perhaps
he
will
not
find
out
at
all
she
thought
dancing
all
the
while
and
trying
to
talk
as
well
as
think
i
was
too
little
for
him
to
remember
i
only
remembered
because
i
had
nothing
else
oh
if
he
should
not
find
out
she
could
not
go
and
tell
him
even
if
a
girl
could
do
such
a
thing
perhaps
he
could
not
recall
a
childish
incident
of
so
long
ago
such
a
small
small
thing
it
had
only
been
immense
to
her
and
so
much
water
had
flowed
under
his
bridge
bearing
so
many
flotillas
she
had
only
stood
and
looked
down
at
a
thin
trickling
stream
which
carried
no
ships
at
all
it
was
very
difficult
to
keep
her
eyes
from
stealing
even
darting
about
in
search
of
him
his
high
fair
head
with
the
clipped
wave
in
its
hair
could
be
followed
if
one
dared
be
alert
he
danced
with
an
auburn
haired
girl
he
spun
down
the
room
with
a
brown
one
he
paused
for
a
moment
to
show
the
trick
of
a
new
step
to
a
tall
one
with
black
coils
he
was
at
the
end
of
the
room
he
was
tangoing
towards
her
and
she
felt
her
heart
beat
and
beat
he
passed
close
by
and
his
eyes
turned
upon
her
and
after
he
had
passed
a
queer
little
inner
trembling
would
not
cease
oh
if
he
had
looked
a
little
longer
if
her
partner
would
only
carry
her
past
him
and
how
dreadful
she
was
to
let
herself
feel
so
excited
when
he
could
not
be
expected
to
remember
such
a
little
thing
just
a
baby
playing
with
him
in
a
garden
oh
her
heart
giving
a
leap
if
he
would
look
if
he
would
look
when
did
she
first
awaken
to
a
realization
after
what
seemed
years
and
years
of
waiting
and
not
being
able
to
conquer
the
inwardly
trembling
feeling
that
he
was
beginning
to
look
that
somehow
he
had
become
aware
of
her
presence
and
that
it
drew
his
eyes
though
there
was
no
special
recognition
in
them
down
the
full
length
of
the
room
they
met
hers
first
and
again
as
he
passed
with
yet
another
partner
then
when
he
was
resting
between
danced
and
being
very
gay
indeed
though
somehow
he
always
seemed
gay
he
had
been
gay
when
they
played
in
the
gardens
yes
his
eyes
cane
and
found
her
she
thought
he
spoke
of
her
to
someone
near
him
of
course
robin
looked
away
and
tried
not
to
look
again
too
soon
but
when
in
spite
of
intention
and
even
determination
something
forced
her
glance
and
made
it
a
creeping
following
glance
there
were
his
eyes
again
she
was
frightened
each
time
it
happened
but
he
was
not
she
began
to
know
with
new
beatings
of
the
pulse
that
he
no
longer
looked
by
chance
but
because
he
wanted
to
see
her
and
wished
her
to
see
him
as
if
he
had
begun
to
call
to
her
with
a
gay
donal
challenge
it
was
like
that
though
his
demeanour
was
faultlessly
correct
the
incident
of
their
meeting
was
faultlessly
correct
also
when
after
one
of
those
endless
lapses
of
time
lady
lothwell
appeared
and
presented
him
as
if
the
brief
ceremony
were
one
of
the
most
ordinary
in
existence
the
conventional
grace
of
his
bow
said
no
more
than
george
had
said
to
those
looking
on
but
when
he
put
his
arm
round
her
and
they
began
to
sway
together
in
the
dance
robin
wondered
in
terror
if
he
could
not
feel
the
beating
of
her
heart
under
his
hand
if
he
could
it
would
be
horrible
but
it
would
not
stop
to
be
so
near
to
try
to
believe
it
to
try
to
make
herself
remember
that
she
could
mean
nothing
to
him
and
that
it
was
only
she
who
was
shaking
for
nothing
but
she
could
not
help
it
this
was
the
disjointed
kind
of
thing
that
flew
past
her
mental
vision
she
was
not
a
shy
girl
but
she
could
not
speak
curiously
enough
he
also
was
quite
silent
for
several
moments
they
danced
for
a
space
without
a
word
and
they
did
not
notice
that
people
began
to
watch
them
because
they
were
an
attracting
pair
to
watch
and
the
truth
was
that
neither
of
the
two
knew
in
the
least
what
the
other
thought
that
is
a
beautiful
waltz
he
said
at
last
he
said
it
in
a
low
meaning
voice
as
if
it
were
a
sort
of
emotional
confidence
he
had
not
actually
meant
to
speak
in
such
a
tone
but
when
he
realized
what
its
sound
had
been
he
did
not
care
in
the
least
what
was
the
matter
with
him
yes
robin
answered
only
yes
he
had
not
known
when
he
glanced
at
her
first
he
was
saying
mentally
he
could
not
of
course
swear
to
her
now
but
what
an
extraordinary
thing
that
she
was
like
a
swallow
she
was
like
any
swift
flying
thing
on
a
man
arm
one
could
go
on
to
the
end
of
time
once
round
the
great
ball
room
twice
and
as
the
third
round
began
he
gave
a
little
laugh
and
spoke
again
i
am
going
to
ask
you
a
question
may
i
yes
is
your
name
robin
yes
she
could
scarcely
breathe
it
i
thought
it
was
in
the
voice
in
which
he
had
spoken
of
the
music
i
hoped
it
was
after
i
first
began
to
suspect
i
hoped
it
was
it
is
it
is
did
we
he
had
not
indeed
meant
that
his
arm
should
hold
her
a
shade
closer
but
in
spite
of
himself
it
did
because
he
was
after
all
so
little
more
than
a
boy
did
we
play
together
in
a
garden
yes
yes
breathed
robin
we
did
surely
she
heard
a
sound
as
if
he
had
caught
a
quick
breath
but
after
it
there
were
a
few
more
steps
and
another
brief
space
of
silence
i
knew
he
said
next
very
low
i
knew
that
we
played
together
in
a
garden
you
did
not
know
when
you
first
looked
at
me
tonight
innocently
revealing
that
even
his
first
glance
had
been
no
casual
thing
to
her
but
his
answer
revealed
something
too
you
were
near
the
door
just
coming
into
the
room
i
did
know
why
you
startled
me
i
kept
looking
for
you
afterwards
in
the
crowd
i
did
see
you
look
said
robin
softly
revealing
still
more
in
her
utter
inexperience
no
because
you
would
look
at
me
you
were
too
much
engaged
do
you
like
this
step
i
like
them
all
do
you
always
dance
like
this
do
you
always
make
your
partner
feel
as
if
he
had
danced
with
you
all
his
life
it
is
because
we
played
together
in
the
garden
said
robin
and
then
was
quite
terrified
at
herself
because
after
all
after
all
they
were
only
two
conventional
young
people
meeting
for
the
first
time
at
a
dance
not
knowing
each
other
in
the
least
it
was
really
the
first
time
the
meeting
of
two
children
could
not
count
but
the
beating
and
strange
elated
inward
tremor
would
not
stop
as
for
him
he
felt
abnormal
also
and
he
was
usually
a
very
normal
creature
it
was
abnormal
to
be
so
excited
that
he
found
himself
as
it
were
upon
another
plane
because
he
had
recognized
and
was
dancing
with
a
girl
he
had
not
seen
since
she
was
five
or
six
it
was
not
normal
that
he
should
be
possessed
by
a
desire
to
keep
near
to
her
overwhelmed
by
an
impelling
wish
to
talk
to
her
to
ask
her
questions
about
what
about
herself
themselves
the
years
between
about
the
garden
it
began
to
come
back
bit
by
bit
after
i
had
two
fair
looks
you
passed
me
several
times
though
you
did
know
oh
had
she
not
known
i
had
been
promised
some
dances
by
other
people
but
i
went
to
lady
lothwell
she
very
kind
back
swept
the
years
and
it
had
all
begun
again
the
wonderful
happiness
just
as
the
anguish
had
swept
back
on
the
night
her
mother
had
come
to
talk
to
her
as
he
had
brought
it
into
her
dreary
little
world
then
he
brought
it
now
he
had
the
power
she
was
so
happy
that
she
seemed
to
be
only
waiting
to
hear
what
he
would
say
as
if
that
were
enough
there
are
phases
like
this
rare
ones
and
it
was
her
fate
that
through
such
a
phase
she
was
passing
it
was
indeed
true
that
much
more
water
had
passed
under
his
bridge
than
under
hers
but
now
memory
reproduced
for
him
with
an
acuteness
like
actual
pain
a
childish
torment
he
thought
he
had
forgotten
and
it
was
as
if
it
had
been
endured
only
yesterday
and
as
if
the
urge
to
speak
and
explain
was
as
intense
as
it
had
been
on
the
first
day
she
very
little
and
she
wo
understand
he
had
said
to
his
mother
she
very
little
really
perhaps
she
cry
how
monstrous
it
had
seemed
had
she
cried
poor
little
soul
he
looked
down
at
her
eyelashes
her
cheek
had
been
of
the
same
colour
and
texture
then
that
came
back
to
him
too
the
impulse
to
tighten
his
arms
was
infernally
powerful
almost
automatic
she
has
no
one
but
me
to
remember
he
heard
his
own
child
voice
saying
fiercely
good
lord
it
was
as
if
it
had
been
yesterday
he
actually
gulped
something
down
in
his
throat
you
have
rested
much
he
said
aloud
there
a
conservatory
with
marble
seats
and
corners
and
a
fountain
going
will
you
let
me
take
you
there
when
we
stop
dancing
i
want
to
apologize
to
you
the
eyelashes
lifted
themselves
and
made
round
her
eyes
the
big
soft
shadow
of
which
sara
studleigh
had
spoken
a
strong
and
healthy
valvular
organ
in
his
breast
lifted
itself
curiously
at
the
same
time
to
apologize
was
he
speaking
to
her
almost
as
if
she
were
still
four
or
five
it
was
to
the
helplessness
of
those
years
he
was
about
to
explain
and
yet
he
did
not
feel
as
though
he
were
still
eight
i
want
to
tell
you
why
i
never
came
back
to
the
garden
it
was
a
broken
promise
was
it
the
music
had
not
ceased
but
they
stopped
dancing
will
you
come
he
said
and
she
went
with
him
like
a
child
just
as
she
had
followed
in
her
babyhood
it
seemed
only
natural
to
do
what
he
asked
the
conservatory
was
like
an
inner
paradise
now
the
tropically
scented
warmth
the
tiers
on
tiers
of
bloom
above
bloom
the
softened
swing
of
music
the
splash
of
the
fountain
on
water
and
leaves
their
plane
had
lifted
itself
too
they
could
hear
the
splashing
water
and
sometimes
feel
it
in
the
corner
seat
of
marble
he
took
her
to
a
crystal
drop
fell
on
her
hand
when
she
sat
down
the
blue
of
his
eyes
was
vaguely
troubled
and
he
spoke
as
if
he
were
not
certain
of
himself
i
was
wakened
up
in
what
seemed
to
me
the
middle
of
the
night
he
said
as
if
indeed
the
thing
had
happened
only
the
day
before
my
mother
was
obliged
to
go
back
suddenly
to
scotland
i
was
only
a
little
chap
but
it
nearly
finished
me
parents
and
guardians
do
understand
how
gigantic
such
a
thing
can
be
i
had
promised
you
we
had
promised
each
other
had
we
yes
said
robin
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
his
face
open
and
unmoving
such
eyes
such
eyes
all
the
touchingness
of
the
past
was
in
their
waiting
on
his
words
children
little
boys
especially
are
taught
that
they
must
not
cry
out
when
they
are
hurt
as
i
sat
in
the
train
through
the
journey
that
day
i
thought
my
heart
would
burst
in
my
small
breast
i
turned
my
back
and
stared
out
of
the
window
for
fear
my
mother
would
see
my
face
i
always
loved
her
do
you
know
i
think
that
just
then
i
hated
her
i
had
never
hated
anything
before
good
lord
what
a
thing
for
a
little
chap
to
go
through
my
mother
was
an
angel
but
she
did
know
no
said
robin
in
a
small
strange
voice
and
without
moving
her
gaze
she
did
know
he
had
seated
himself
on
a
sort
of
low
marble
stool
near
her
and
he
held
a
knee
with
clasped
hands
they
were
hands
which
held
each
other
for
the
moment
with
a
sort
of
emotional
clinch
his
position
made
him
look
upward
at
her
instead
of
down
it
was
you
i
was
wild
about
he
said
you
see
it
was
you
i
could
have
stood
it
for
myself
the
trouble
was
that
i
felt
i
was
such
a
big
little
chap
i
thought
i
was
years
ages
older
than
you
and
mountains
bigger
his
faint
laugh
was
touched
with
pity
for
the
smallness
of
the
big
little
chap
you
seemed
so
tiny
and
pretty
and
lonely
i
was
as
lonely
as
a
bird
fallen
out
of
its
nest
you
had
told
me
you
had
you
said
no
one
had
ever
kissed
you
i
been
loved
all
my
life
you
had
a
wondering
way
of
fixing
your
eyes
on
me
as
if
i
could
give
you
everything
perhaps
it
was
a
coxy
little
chap
conceit
that
made
me
love
you
for
it
but
perhaps
it
was
you
were
everything
robin
said
and
the
mere
simpleness
of
the
way
in
which
she
said
it
brought
the
garden
so
near
that
he
smelt
the
warm
hawthorn
and
heard
the
distant
piano
organ
and
it
quickened
his
breath
it
was
because
i
kept
seeing
your
eyes
and
hearing
your
laugh
that
i
thought
my
heart
was
bursting
i
knew
you
go
and
wait
for
me
and
gradually
your
little
face
would
begin
to
look
different
i
knew
you
believe
i
come
little
that
was
what
i
kept
saying
to
myself
again
and
again
she
cry
awfully
and
she
think
i
did
it
she
never
know
there
he
hesitated
a
moment
there
was
a
kind
of
mad
shame
in
it
as
if
i
betrayed
your
littleness
and
your
belief
though
i
was
too
young
to
know
what
betraying
was
just
as
she
had
looked
at
him
before
as
if
he
could
give
her
everything
she
was
looking
at
him
now
in
what
other
way
could
she
look
while
he
gave
her
this
wonderful
soothing
binding
softly
all
the
old
wounds
with
unconscious
natural
touch
because
he
had
really
been
all
her
child
being
had
been
irradiated
and
warmed
by
there
was
no
pose
in
his
manner
no
sentimental
or
flirtatious
youth
affecting
of
a
picturesque
attitude
it
was
real
and
he
told
her
this
thing
because
he
must
for
his
own
relief
did
you
cry
he
said
did
my
little
chap
conceit
make
too
much
of
it
i
suppose
i
ought
to
hope
it
did
robin
put
her
hand
softly
against
her
heart
no
she
answered
i
was
only
a
baby
but
i
think
it
killed
something
here
he
caught
a
big
hard
breath
oh
he
said
and
for
a
few
seconds
simply
sat
and
gazed
at
her
but
it
came
to
life
again
he
said
afterwards
i
do
know
i
do
know
what
it
was
perhaps
it
could
only
live
in
a
very
little
creature
but
it
was
killed
i
say
broke
from
him
it
was
like
wringing
a
canary
neck
when
it
was
singing
in
the
sun
a
sudden
swelling
of
the
music
of
a
new
dance
swept
in
to
them
and
he
rose
and
stood
up
before
her
thank
you
for
giving
me
my
chance
to
tell
you
he
said
this
was
the
apology
you
have
been
kind
to
listen
i
wanted
to
listen
robin
said
i
am
glad
i
did
live
a
long
time
and
grow
old
and
die
without
your
telling
me
when
i
saw
you
tonight
i
almost
said
aloud
come
back
i
glad
i
came
it
queer
how
one
can
live
a
thing
over
again
there
have
been
all
the
years
between
for
us
both
for
me
been
all
a
lad
life
tutors
and
eton
and
oxford
and
people
and
lots
of
travel
and
amusement
but
the
minute
i
set
eyes
on
you
near
the
door
something
must
have
begun
to
drag
me
back
i
own
i
never
liked
to
let
myself
dwell
on
that
memory
it
was
a
good
thing
because
it
had
a
trick
of
taking
me
back
in
a
fiendish
way
to
the
little
chap
with
his
heart
bursting
in
the
railway
carriage
and
the
betrayal
feeling
it
morbid
to
let
yourself
grouse
over
what
ca
be
undone
so
you
faded
away
but
when
i
danced
past
you
somehow
i
knew
i
come
on
something
it
made
me
restless
i
could
keep
my
eyes
away
decently
then
all
at
once
i
knew
i
could
tell
you
what
the
effect
was
there
you
were
again
i
was
as
much
obliged
to
tell
you
as
i
should
have
been
if
i
found
you
at
braemarnie
when
i
got
there
that
night
conventions
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
would
not
have
mattered
even
if
you
obviously
thought
i
was
a
fool
you
might
have
thought
so
you
know
no
i
might
answered
robin
there
have
been
no
eton
and
oxford
and
amusements
for
me
this
is
my
first
party
she
rose
as
he
had
done
and
they
stood
for
a
second
or
so
with
their
eyes
resting
on
each
other
each
with
a
young
smile
quivering
into
life
which
neither
was
conscious
of
it
was
she
who
first
wakened
and
came
back
he
saw
a
tiny
pulse
flutter
in
her
throat
and
she
lifted
her
hand
with
a
delicate
gesture
this
dance
was
lord
halwyn
and
we
sat
it
out
we
must
go
back
to
the
ball
room
i
suppose
we
must
he
answered
with
slow
reluctance
but
he
could
scarcely
drag
his
eyes
away
from
hers
even
though
he
obeyed
and
they
turned
and
went
in
the
shining
ball
room
the
music
rose
and
fell
and
swelled
again
into
ecstasy
as
he
took
her
white
young
lightness
in
his
arm
and
they
swayed
and
darted
and
swooped
like
things
of
the
air
while
the
old
duchess
and
lord
coombe
looked
on
almost
unseeing
and
talked
in
murmurs
of
sarajevo
the
end
publishers
note
the
inflexible
limitations
of
magazine
space
necessitated
the
omission
in
its
serial
form
of
so
large
a
portion
of
the
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
as
to
eliminate
much
of
the
charm
of
characterization
and
the
creation
of
atmosphere
and
background
which
add
so
greatly
to
the
power
and
picturesqueness
of
the
author
work
these
values
having
been
unavoidably
lost
in
a
greatly
compressed
version
it
is
the
publishers
desire
to
produce
the
story
in
its
entirety
and
as
during
its
writing
it
developed
into
what
might
be
regarded
as
two
novels
so
distinctly
does
it
deal
with
two
epochs
it
has
been
decided
to
present
it
to
its
public
as
two
separate
books
the
first
the
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
deals
with
social
life
in
london
during
the
evolutionary
period
between
the
late
victorian
years
and
the
reign
of
edward
vii
and
that
of
his
successor
previous
to
the
great
war
it
brings
lord
coombe
and
donal
feather
and
her
girl
robin
to
the
summer
of
it
ends
with
the
ending
of
a
world
which
can
never
again
be
the
same
the
second
novel
robin
to
be
published
later
continues
the
story
of
the
same
characters
facing
existence
however
in
a
world
transformed
by
tragedy
and
in
which
new
aspects
of
character
new
social
economic
and
spiritual
possibilities
are
to
be
confronted
rising
to
the
surface
of
life
as
from
the
depths
of
unknown
seas
readers
of
the
head
of
the
house
of
coombe
will
follow
the
story
of
robin
with
intensified
interest
