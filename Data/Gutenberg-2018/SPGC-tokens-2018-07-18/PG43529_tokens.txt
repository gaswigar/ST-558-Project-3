you
have

for

volume
i
letter
i
from
caroline
ashburn
to
the
honourable
george
valmont
sir
i
am
by
no
means
indifferent
as
to
the
opinion
you
may
form
of
me
in
consequence
of
my
abrupt
and
in
a
degree
rude
conduct
when
you
so
peremptorily
denied
the
boon
i
would
have
begged
on
quitting
your
castle
if
the
reasons
which
guided
your
refusal
were
such
as
fully
satisfied
yourself
however
incompetent
they
might
be
in
my
judgment
i
was
wrong
in
being
offended
and
in
showing
my
resentment
by
something
like
invective
ere
we
had
travelled
two
miles
i
became
sensible
of
my
pride
and
injustice
and
it
is
from
our
first
resting
place
i
thus
present
myself
to
acknowledge
my
fault
to
ask
other
favors
and
to
tell
you
that
i
have
no
pleasure
in
view
equal
to
that
i
expected
to
enjoy
in
the
society
of
miss
valmont
but
though
you
denied
me
the
charm
of
associating
with
your
niece
you
will
not
also
refuse
me
her
correspondence
a
letter
sir
can
not
waft
down
your
the
spirit
of
my
affection
breathed
therein
can
not
disenchant
her
from
the
spell
of
your
authority
no
and
you
surely
will
not
forbid
an
indulgence
so
endearing
to
us
while
unimportant
to
yourself
already
i
feel
assured
of
your
consent
and
with
my
thanks
dismiss
the
subject
as
your
seclusion
of
miss
valmont
from
the
world
is
not
a
plan
of
yesterday
i
imagine
you
are
persuaded
of
its
value
and
propriety
and
i
therefore
see
nothing
which
should
deter
me
from
indulging
the
strong
propensity
i
feel
to
enquire
into
the
nature
of
your
system
a
system
so
opposite
to
the
general
practice
of
mankind
and
which
i
am
inclined
to
think
is
not
as
perfect
as
you
are
willing
to
suppose
remembering
your
contempt
of
the
female
character
i
am
aware
that
you
may
possibly
treat
this
part
of
my
letter
only
with
neglect
or
disdain
gladly
would
i
devise
a
means
by
which
to
induce
you
to
lay
aside
this
prejudice
against
us
and
in
the
language
of
reason
as
from
one
being
to
another
discuss
with
me
the
merits
or
defects
of
your
plan
which
from
its
singularity
on
the
first
view
excited
my
curiosity
and
has
since
from
my
observation
of
some
of
its
consequences
interested
me
by
worthier
feelings
than
that
of
mere
curiosity
if
miss
education
treatment
and
utter
seclusion
were
most
valuable
for
her
why
should
she
yet
so
young
and
removed
from
the
common
misfortunes
of
life
why
should
she
be
unhappy
you
sir
may
not
have
perceived
this
effect
of
your
system
for
although
shut
within
the
same
boundary
and
resident
under
one
roof
you
seldom
see
her
and
when
you
do
see
you
do
not
study
her
i
believe
i
know
more
of
her
mental
temperament
in
our
seven
days
intercourse
than
you
have
learned
in
seven
years
and
i
affirm
that
she
is
unhappy
yet
it
is
only
from
her
sudden
wanderings
in
conversation
and
that
apparent
restlessness
of
dissatisfaction
in
her
which
seeks
change
of
place
because
of
all
places
alike
are
irksome
that
i
ground
my
opinion
for
having
flattered
myself
that
you
would
permit
her
to
accompany
me
from
your
castle
i
passed
the
days
of
my
abode
there
in
closely
observing
miss
valmont
rather
than
in
endeavouring
to
gain
her
entire
confidence
and
have
perhaps
made
but
little
progress
toward
obtaining
a
friendship
to
which
my
heart
aspires
with
zeal
and
affection
in
the
hope
of
a
speedy
and
candid
answer
from
you
i
remain
sir
your
well
wisher
and
humble
servant
caroline
ashburn
letter
ii
from
sibella
valmont
to
caroline
ashburn
i
am
come
from
valmont
can
it
be
oh
yes
i
am
come
from
valmont
presence
to
write
a
letter
a
letter
to
you
ah
miss
ashburn
to
write
a
letter
to
you
by
my
uncle
can
command
ever
be
indulgence
no
no
i
will
not
believe
that
no
not
even
would
i
believe
it
though
when
my
heart
expands
with
swelling
emotion
he
were
then
also
to
command
me
to
miss
ashburn
the
command
of
valmont
in
this
as
in
all
other
instances
is
stern
and
repulsive
but
as
his
commands
are
odious
to
my
acceptation
so
in
equal
degree
is
the
action
of
writing
a
letter
to
you
grateful
delightful
overwhelming
how
came
it
how
have
you
prevailed
oh
teach
me
your
art
to
soften
his
power
to
unloose
the
grasp
of
his
authority
and
i
will
love
you
as
i
believe
i
can
not
love
you
better
than
i
do
for
have
you
not
cast
a
ray
of
cheering
light
upon
my
dungeon
have
you
not
bestowed
upon
me
the
only
charm
of
existence
that
i
have
known
for
many
and
many
a
tedious
day
but
why
did
you
do
so
do
you
love
me
as
i
love
you
you
never
told
me
so
seven
days
and
seven
nights
you
lived
in
our
castle
and
you
walked
with
me
by
day
you
wandered
with
me
by
night
i
talked
to
you
almost
without
you
spoke
infinitely
less
than
i
you
pressed
my
hand
as
it
held
yours
but
you
never
said
love
you
i
love
you
sibella
with
all
my
nor
did
you
ever
quit
your
rest
amidst
the
darkness
of
the
night
to
hover
near
my
chamber
as
i
have
done
near
yes
miss
ashburn
when
at
night
you
had
retired
from
me
i
beheld
only
solitude
and
imprisonment
and
i
have
waited
hours
in
that
forlorn
gallery
that
i
might
catch
the
whisper
of
your
breathings
that
the
consciousness
of
being
near
a
friend
might
restore
me
to
hope
to
hilarity
to
confidence
yet
now
i
recollect
it
and
you
do
love
me
for
you
asked
the
imperious
the
denying
valmont
to
let
you
take
me
from
the
castle
oh
you
did
urge
you
did
you
do
love
i
am
writing
a
letter
to
you
and
perhaps
one
day
i
shall
have
all
my
happiness
i
wish
valmont
would
show
me
the
letter
you
wrote
to
him
he
has
charged
me
to
answer
it
and
i
have
been
obliged
to
walk
a
great
while
and
to
think
a
great
deal
before
i
could
remember
a
word
of
what
he
said
i
was
to
repeat
to
you
and
now
i
do
not
think
i
recollect
the
whole
i
would
return
to
his
study
and
ask
him
to
tell
it
me
again
but
he
has
an
aversion
to
trouble
and
perhaps
irritated
by
my
forgetfulness
might
say
i
should
not
write
to
you
at
ah
if
he
were
to
say
that
miss
ashburn
and
if
it
were
possible
for
me
to
send
a
letter
out
of
the
castle
in
defiance
of
his
commands
do
you
think
i
would
obey
him
no
no
andrew
came
to
me
in
the
wood
to
bid
me
attend
my
uncle
in
his
library
and
i
went
thither
immediately
he
was
but
just
risen
and
a
letter
which
i
suppose
was
your
letter
and
which
must
have
arrived
yesterday
was
laying
open
on
the
table
beside
him
and
when
he
spoke
to
me
he
laid
his
right
hand
upon
the
letter
are
the
hours
child
valmont
said
to
me
soon
after
i
entered
i
have
employed
in
pondering
on
your
welfare
yet
you
are
not
the
docile
and
grateful
creature
i
expected
to
find
you
i
said
in
all
those
hours
of
pondering
you
never
thought
of
the
only
means
by
which
my
welfare
can
be
effected
am
i
therefore
forbidden
to
be
happy
am
i
to
be
unhappy
because
i
and
not
you
discovered
how
i
might
be
very
very
happy
valmont
raised
himself
more
erect
on
his
chair
and
he
frowned
too
reasoning
he
said
tell
you
child
you
can
not
you
shall
not
reason
repine
in
secret
as
much
as
you
please
but
no
reasonings
no
matter
how
sullen
the
submission
if
it
is
submission
i
replied
do
not
think
as
you
do
you
are
not
born
to
think
you
were
not
made
to
think
he
turned
the
letter
on
the
table
as
he
spoke
and
took
a
leaning
attitude
i
can
not
sibella
cried
my
uncle
he
fiercely
recovered
his
upright
posture
and
then
for
i
was
effectually
silenced
he
gradually
and
slowly
fell
back
into
his
reclining
station
indeed
miss
ashburn
i
am
in
some
instances
still
a
mere
child
as
valmont
calls
me
and
yet
i
wish
you
would
account
for
it
for
i
do
not
know
how
i
feel
every
day
bolder
and
bolder
i
can
speak
to
him
when
i
first
meet
him
as
calmly
as
i
can
to
andrew
and
i
can
oppose
him
a
little
and
when
i
have
not
opposed
him
as
much
as
i
wish
to
do
and
have
ran
away
from
the
fight
of
his
face
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
i
take
myself
to
talk
and
say
foolish
sibella
can
a
frown
kill
you
can
your
uncle
though
he
should
be
tenfold
angry
with
you
do
more
to
you
than
he
has
already
done
and
when
my
throbbing
heart
denies
the
possibility
of
that
i
resolve
the
next
time
to
tell
him
every
thing
i
feel
and
then
i
wait
and
long
and
wish
that
the
next
time
would
arrive
when
it
does
arrive
i
begin
without
fear
or
at
least
i
have
only
a
weak
trembling
which
i
should
soon
lose
if
he
did
not
call
up
one
of
those
frowns
which
infallibly
condemn
me
to
silence
and
to
terror
but
i
know
and
he
knows
too
if
he
would
but
own
it
that
i
do
think
that
i
was
born
to
think
and
i
will
think
oh
dear
dear
miss
ashburn
i
am
writing
a
letter
to
you
and
what
was
it
but
my
power
of
thought
which
gave
birth
to
that
affection
which
would
impel
me
on
with
a
rapidity
that
my
pen
can
not
follow
it
seems
to
me
that
my
thought
dictates
volumes
in
an
instant
and
that
in
an
instant
i
have
said
volumes
yet
i
have
only
a
few
pages
of
paper
under
my
eye
and
my
hand
if
valmont
tells
me
i
can
not
cut
the
air
with
wings
i
will
answer
is
true
but
in
imagination
i
can
encompass
the
vast
globe
in
a
second
hail
thought
thought
the
soul
of
existence
not
think
why
do
not
all
forms
in
which
the
pulse
of
life
vibrates
possess
the
power
of
thought
have
i
not
seen
the
worm
crawling
from
his
earthy
bed
to
drink
the
dew
from
the
grass
swiftly
shrink
back
to
his
shelter
his
attentive
ear
alarmed
by
my
approach
the
very
insect
while
sporting
in
the
rapture
of
a
on
my
habit
is
yet
wary
and
vigilant
and
will
rather
leave
his
enjoyment
if
apprehension
seize
him
than
hazard
the
possibility
of
my
inflicting
injury
upon
him
and
what
but
thought
imperceptible
yet
mighty
thought
could
make
a
creature
so
infinitely
diminutive
in
its
proportions
so
apparently
valueless
in
the
creation
shun
the
hand
of
power
and
seek
for
itself
sources
of
enjoyment
i
could
tell
you
miss
ashburn
how
i
have
imagined
i
met
sympathy
and
reflection
in
that
flower
which
enamoured
of
the
sun
mourns
throughout
the
term
of
his
absence
droops
on
her
stalk
and
shuts
her
bosom
to
the
gloom
and
darkness
which
succeeds
nor
bursts
again
into
vigour
and
beauty
till
cheered
by
his
all
inspiring
return
it
is
not
for
you
happy
you
who
live
with
liberty
live
as
free
to
indulge
as
to
form
your
wishes
i
say
it
is
not
for
you
to
find
tongues
in
the
wind
it
is
for
the
imprisoned
sibella
to
feed
on
such
illusions
to
waft
herself
on
the
pinions
of
fancy
beyond
valmont
barriers
within
which
for
the
two
last
years
her
fetters
have
been
insupportable
for
two
years
except
when
she
saw
you
has
she
been
joyless
i
could
talk
of
those
two
years
but
then
i
should
want
also
to
tell
you
miss
ashburn
of
the
previous
hours
the
days
the
months
the
years
that
came
that
smiled
and
passed
away
i
wonder
if
i
should
tire
you
surely
i
think
not
yet
i
have
already
written
much
and
i
have
also
my
uncle
words
to
ah
to
quit
such
a
theme
for
my
uncle
i
told
you
valmont
silenced
me
by
his
frowns
he
was
some
time
silent
himself
he
took
the
letter
from
off
the
table
and
appeared
to
read
parts
of
it
at
length
he
said
ashburn
has
very
properly
apologized
for
her
behaviour
to
me
the
morning
she
went
hence
doubtless
child
you
also
were
much
disappointed
that
i
did
not
consent
to
your
going
with
her
and
her
mother
sir
my
uncle
said
seemingly
surprised
why
not
i
did
not
expect
you
would
suffer
me
to
go
it
was
a
mighty
natural
expectation
my
uncle
looked
angry
he
presently
added
you
wish
to
go
with
them
child
yes
sir
i
did
indeed
wish
was
natural
enough
sibella
that
you
should
wish
for
such
an
indulgence
and
he
said
this
very
mildly
i
alone
am
capable
of
judging
of
its
propriety
miss
ashburn
i
believe
has
been
little
used
to
disappointment
i
pity
her
perhaps
a
miserable
old
age
is
in
store
for
her
i
exclaimed
but
the
exclamation
was
swift
and
low
and
my
uncle
absorbed
in
contemplating
his
own
designs
did
not
hear
me
and
at
last
he
told
me
after
many
pauses
many
slow
speeches
that
you
may
write
letters
to
me
and
that
i
shall
write
letters
to
you
i
would
have
kissed
him
for
i
had
seized
his
hand
but
his
eye
spoke
no
encouragement
and
i
sat
down
again
to
glow
and
to
tremble
part
of
what
followed
has
escaped
me
as
i
feared
it
would
i
remember
that
my
uncle
said
miss
ashburn
from
me
sibella
that
like
all
other
females
she
has
decided
with
more
haste
than
judgment
thus
much
for
valmont
and
now
for
myself
miss
ashburn
no
dear
caroline
adieu
sibella
valmont
letter
iii
from
caroline
ashburn
to
sibella
valmont
thankful
to
valmont
for
his
consent
to
my
request
and
more
and
more
endeared
to
you
my
sibella
by
the
joy
with
which
you
receive
his
consent
i
am
impatient
till
i
have
explained
the
motives
that
withheld
me
while
in
the
woods
of
valmont
from
saying
love
you
i
love
you
sibella
with
all
my
to
have
these
motives
fully
understood
by
you
it
is
necessary
i
should
made
a
sketch
of
my
education
the
incidents
of
my
life
and
their
consequent
effect
upon
my
character
yet
i
know
you
will
continue
to
read
with
avidity
ask
yourself
if
the
ear
of
affection
is
easily
satiated
with
the
communications
of
a
friend
and
wonder
that
you
should
have
repressed
your
wishes
when
they
incited
you
to
unfold
to
me
with
minute
attention
the
feelings
of
your
heart
the
breaks
the
allusions
in
your
letter
led
me
for
a
time
into
the
tormenting
and
silly
practice
of
forming
conjectures
now
i
have
ceased
to
conjecture
but
i
have
not
ceased
to
be
desirous
of
being
admitted
to
your
utmost
confidence
to
the
full
participation
of
your
remembrances
whether
of
joy
or
of
sorrow
you
have
seen
my
mother
sibella
but
people
of
a
superior
class
must
have
superior
forms
and
the
endearing
name
of
mother
is
banished
for
the
cold
title
of
ceremony
ashburn
as
i
am
now
tutored
to
call
her
was
the
very
fashionable
daughter
of
very
fashionable
parents
who
died
when
she
had
attained
the
age
of
and
left
her
in
possession
of
the
most
aspiring
longings
after
splendor
and
dissipation
but
destitute
of
every
means
for
their
gratification
among
the
many
friends
who
came
to
pity
or
advise
one
offered
her
his
assistance
his
proposal
was
abrupt
and
disgusting
but
there
was
no
alternative
he
would
equip
her
to
go
in
search
of
a
wealthy
marriage
among
the
luxurious
inhabitants
of
india
or
with
her
other
professing
friends
he
would
leave
her
to
the
poverty
which
lay
immediately
before
her
the
offer
after
little
deliberation
was
accepted
rather
than
be
poor
she
humbled
the
pride
of
her
birth
and
pretensions
she
strengthened
her
nerves
for
the
voyage
and
having
safely
arrived
in
india
her
recommendations
but
above
all
her
personal
charms
secured
her
the
addresses
of
ashburn
who
though
he
was
neither
young
nor
attractive
had
gold
and
diamonds
in
abundance
a
very
short
interval
elapsed
between
the
commencement
of
their
acquaintance
with
each
other
and
the
celebration
of
their
marriage
after
my
birth
my
father
bowed
to
no
other
idol
than
me
for
although
my
father
had
gained
a
very
handsome
wife
and
my
mother
almost
the
wealthiest
of
husbands
yet
happiness
was
still
at
a
distance
from
them
indolent
in
the
extreme
he
abhorred
every
species
of
pleasure
which
required
a
portion
of
activity
in
its
pursuit
he
equally
abhorred
solitude
and
expected
to
find
in
his
wife
a
lounging
companion
a
partaker
of
his
habits
something
little
differing
from
a
mere
automaton
she
on
the
contrary
was
laborious
in
the
pursuits
of
pleasure
and
dissipation
she
had
pride
and
spirit
to
maintain
her
resolution
of
gratifying
her
own
wishes
he
was
too
idle
to
remonstrate
and
theirs
was
an
union
as
widely
removed
from
the
interruptions
of
bickerings
and
jealousies
as
from
the
confidence
esteem
and
endearments
of
affection
from
me
then
my
father
expected
to
gain
the
satisfaction
his
marriage
had
failed
to
afford
nor
were
his
hopes
better
founded
than
heretofore
admired
adored
by
him
flattered
by
his
slaves
incited
by
indulgencies
showered
upon
me
without
distinction
to
make
demands
the
most
extravagant
and
unattainable
i
oftener
tormented
my
father
by
my
caprice
than
delighted
him
by
my
fondness
but
still
every
species
of
advice
or
of
restraint
was
withheld
and
i
continued
fruitful
in
expedients
for
the
exercise
of
my
power
continued
the
discontented
slave
of
my
own
tyranny
happily
for
me
i
met
with
an
adventure
when
i
was
little
more
than
thirteen
years
of
age
that
wrought
miracles
upon
me
near
to
a
seat
of
my
father
as
near
as
the
cottage
of
poverty
dare
rise
to
the
palace
of
opulence
lived
the
wife
and
family
of
a
poor
industrious
european
the
blue
eyes
of
one
of
their
children
had
spoken
so
submissively
once
or
twice
as
she
viewed
me
passing
that
i
became
enamoured
of
her
interesting
countenance
and
demanded
to
have
her
for
a
playmate
day
after
day
nancy
came
and
my
fondness
for
her
increased
daily
if
the
turbulence
of
my
temper
sometimes
broke
loose
in
the
course
of
our
amusements
i
afterward
endeavoured
by
increased
efforts
of
condescension
to
relieve
nancy
from
the
terror
my
pride
or
violence
had
excited
and
to
impress
her
with
a
strong
sense
of
my
attachment
to
herself
in
her
presence
i
affected
to
be
more
than
commonly
overbearing
and
insolent
to
those
around
us
while
to
her
i
was
attentive
and
obliging
at
length
i
became
resolved
to
have
her
wholly
at
my
command
and
without
troubling
myself
to
enquire
whether
or
not
my
father
would
object
to
my
plan
i
rose
earlier
than
usual
one
morning
and
dispatched
a
messenger
for
nancy
and
while
he
was
absent
pleased
myself
with
anticipating
what
answers
she
would
make
and
what
joy
she
would
evince
when
i
should
tell
her
that
henceforward
she
should
live
with
me
and
should
have
as
fine
clothes
as
fine
apartments
and
as
many
slaves
to
obey
her
as
i
myself
possessed
my
messenger
returned
alone
he
told
me
nancy
was
what
a
disappointment
how
insolent
methought
to
be
ill
when
i
wanted
her
more
than
i
had
ever
wanted
her
before
and
so
much
did
she
appear
to
merit
my
resentment
that
i
gave
orders
she
should
be
forbidden
to
see
me
again
and
that
all
the
valuable
trinkets
i
had
heaped
upon
her
should
be
taken
from
her
by
force
if
she
would
not
yield
them
when
demanded
but
no
sooner
were
the
toys
brought
into
my
presence
than
i
relented
sent
them
back
with
many
additions
and
wept
while
i
delivered
messages
intreating
that
she
would
be
well
by
the
next
day
on
the
morrow
still
no
nancy
came
and
i
passed
the
day
in
alternate
paroxysms
of
rage
and
sorrow
the
third
morning
i
hastened
to
the
cottage
and
the
first
object
i
beheld
was
nancy
blooming
as
health
could
make
her
the
insolence
with
which
i
reproached
the
mother
of
nancy
on
this
occasion
may
be
easily
imagined
but
i
shall
relate
minutely
to
you
sibella
the
good
woman
answer
i
have
never
forgotten
it
she
said
might
as
well
have
told
the
truth
at
once
for
out
it
must
nancy
is
not
sick
in
body
miss
and
if
i
can
help
it
she
sha
be
sick
in
mind
your
papa
is
a
great
rich
man
and
you
will
be
a
great
rich
lady
you
miss
who
are
so
high
born
and
so
rich
need
not
care
if
people
do
hate
you
but
my
nancy
is
a
poor
child
and
will
never
have
a
penny
that
a
of
her
own
earning
she
never
used
to
fleer
and
flout
and
stamp
at
her
little
brothers
and
sisters
as
she
does
since
she
came
to
your
house
miss
and
so
miss
as
she
will
never
be
able
to
pay
folks
for
saying
she
is
good
when
she
is
bad
i
who
am
her
mother
must
make
her
as
good
as
i
can
you
may
be
good
enough
for
a
great
lady
but
nancy
will
never
be
a
great
lady
and
be
as
angry
as
you
will
miss
indeed
she
ca
come
to
your
fine
house
any
more
yes
sibella
she
persisted
in
defiance
of
my
resentment
and
its
probable
consequences
the
worthy
woman
persisted
in
preserving
her
child
from
the
infectious
example
of
my
vices
her
lesson
had
awakened
in
my
mind
a
true
sense
of
my
situation
nor
could
anger
or
disdain
once
force
me
from
the
painful
conviction
that
people
were
hired
and
paid
to
lavish
on
me
their
insincere
encomiums
all
the
instances
of
attention
or
kindness
i
could
recollect
i
believed
had
been
mine
only
because
i
was
rich
and
powerful
i
imagined
i
saw
lurking
hatred
and
loathing
in
every
eye
and
though
i
ceased
to
command
i
resented
with
an
acrimony
almost
past
description
every
effort
that
was
directed
towards
increasing
my
pleasures
or
convenience
these
ebulitions
of
a
wounded
vanity
insensibly
wore
away
while
i
considered
how
much
of
amendment
and
happiness
was
yet
in
my
power
and
at
length
i
began
seriously
to
remedy
the
defects
which
had
made
me
unworthy
to
be
the
companion
of
nancy
but
ere
i
had
courage
to
demand
again
the
society
of
my
little
friend
her
parents
had
removed
to
a
distant
part
of
the
country
and
in
this
instance
frustrated
the
end
of
my
labours
yet
the
labour
itself
had
become
delightful
and
was
amply
rewarded
by
the
satisfaction
betrayed
in
the
eyes
of
my
numerous
attendants
but
who
however
as
i
was
a
great
lady
and
a
rich
lady
durst
not
openly
rejoice
in
my
amendment
i
longed
to
hear
them
burst
into
praises
i
almost
sickened
for
the
accents
of
commendation
but
shame
of
my
former
unworthiness
and
perhaps
a
remaining
degree
of
pride
withheld
me
from
encouraging
such
an
explanation
and
they
continued
silently
to
receive
the
benefits
of
my
reformation
and
now
sibella
i
must
bring
you
back
again
to
my
mother
with
whom
in
these
years
of
childhood
i
have
been
but
little
acquainted
she
hated
children
their
noise
and
prattle
and
monkey
tricks
threw
her
into
hysterics
for
a
few
minutes
after
dinner
i
was
sometimes
admitted
hushed
to
silence
with
a
profusion
of
sweetmeats
and
dismissed
with
a
kiss
or
a
frown
just
as
the
avocations
and
pleasures
of
the
day
happened
to
fix
her
disposition
as
i
grew
older
i
was
occasionally
allowed
to
sit
in
her
or
to
take
the
air
with
her
in
the
same
carriage
and
on
those
occasions
i
reached
the
highest
pinnacle
of
her
confidence
and
used
to
listen
while
she
poured
forth
her
longing
desires
to
return
to
england
as
i
had
been
frequently
disgusted
at
witnessing
the
malignant
feuds
existing
among
the
europeans
resident
in
the
it
was
easy
for
her
to
interest
me
in
the
first
of
her
wishes
namely
that
my
father
would
return
to
england
she
spoke
of
this
island
as
of
the
abode
of
pleasure
she
described
an
almost
innumerable
circle
of
friends
amidst
whose
society
delights
would
abound
my
imagination
gave
a
stronger
colouring
to
her
pictures
i
indulged
the
visionary
theme
till
i
also
panted
to
become
an
inhabitant
of
this
climate
of
peace
joy
and
felicity
no
sooner
had
i
adopted
the
project
than
my
father
lethargic
indolence
gave
way
to
his
desire
of
gratifying
my
wishes
he
vigorously
completed
the
necessary
arrangement
of
his
affairs
and
we
were
in
daily
expectation
of
quitting
india
when
he
was
attacked
by
the
malignant
disease
of
which
he
died
my
mother
was
now
the
uncontrouled
mistress
of
a
world
of
wealth
and
placing
her
remittances
in
a
proper
train
we
speedily
set
sail
for
our
land
of
promise
safely
arrived
in
london
i
expected
ashburn
would
instantly
fly
to
the
embraces
of
her
friends
but
no
a
sumptuous
house
and
equipage
were
first
to
be
prepared
and
while
she
exulted
in
preparation
i
repined
at
her
want
of
sympathy
for
the
feelings
of
those
who
i
imagined
were
expecting
her
with
fondness
and
impatience
alas
sibella
i
had
not
followed
my
mother
three
times
into
her
circles
of
friendship
ere
i
discovered
that
the
enjoyments
she
had
looked
forward
to
during
so
many
years
consisted
only
of
triumphing
with
superiority
of
splendor
over
those
who
formerly
with
the
same
motives
had
triumphed
over
her
here
my
enthusiasm
in
the
search
of
sincere
and
uniform
friendship
would
have
been
extinguished
but
that
my
hopes
yet
rested
on
valmont
of
valmont
my
mother
had
spoken
as
playmate
schoolmate
and
the
confidant
of
juvenile
secrets
separated
said
i
to
myself
near
twenty
years
what
emotions
must
a
first
interview
produce
the
fire
of
youth
in
valmont
and
ashburn
will
be
for
some
moments
renewed
and
i
shall
anticipate
the
effusions
of
my
own
heart
when
it
finds
a
friend
after
exhibiting
our
pomp
at
every
place
of
resort
in
the
metropolis
we
began
our
tour
and
passed
by
several
invitations
to
pay
our
first
visit
at
valmont
castle
what
a
freezing
sensation
crept
in
my
veins
as
we
waited
for
the
raising
of
your
uncle
as
we
rolled
along
his
dark
avenues
such
gloom
such
menacing
grandeur
brought
into
my
mind
a
feeling
totally
opposite
to
the
hilarity
the
glow
of
expectation
i
had
cherished
on
the
journey
many
persons
had
spoken
in
my
hearing
of
valmont
as
the
most
absurd
ridiculous
misanthrope
of
his
age
but
i
had
not
the
highest
respect
for
the
authorities
from
which
the
information
was
derived
and
i
had
also
conceived
with
much
more
fancy
than
judgment
of
the
delights
of
a
life
of
solitude
i
in
my
dream
had
forgotten
the
name
of
castle
and
the
ideas
associating
with
the
name
my
imagination
in
its
reveries
had
blended
elegance
and
simplicity
nature
and
art
with
their
most
fascinating
productions
when
instead
of
smiling
lawns
and
gay
parterres
without
i
found
moats
walls
and
frowning
battlements
that
looked
as
uninviting
on
the
friend
as
threatening
on
the
enemy
turrets
all
cheerless
all
hostile
and
discouraging
to
the
wandering
stranger
the
castle
gothic
magnificence
within
reminded
us
at
every
step
of
the
dignity
of
the
valmont
race
the
apartments
received
their
guests
without
welcome
the
domestics
were
obedient
but
neither
cheerful
nor
attentive
through
carved
saloons
and
arched
galleries
into
which
the
bright
sun
of
spring
can
only
cast
an
oblique
ray
we
were
conducted
to
my
sibella
can
you
not
imagine
you
hear
your
aunt
mingling
complaint
and
compliment
languor
and
restlessness
and
labouring
to
interest
real
sensibility
by
moans
of
imaginary
disease
can
you
not
imagine
my
mother
secretly
urging
her
triumphs
over
the
immured
valmont
by
lamenting
the
slavery
of
pleasure
to
which
she
herself
is
perpetually
compelled
and
can
you
not
see
your
disappointed
disgusted
caroline
ashburn
viewing
caresses
without
warmth
hearkening
to
professions
without
sincerity
your
uncle
entered
the
room
for
a
moment
appearing
to
act
to
speak
to
look
according
to
some
rule
settled
for
the
hour
i
deemed
his
character
too
much
assumed
to
be
quickly
understood
from
the
solemn
pride
which
sat
on
his
brow
i
judged
however
that
he
was
fitted
for
his
castle
and
his
castle
fitted
for
him
here
thought
i
in
this
place
and
with
these
people
have
we
promised
to
remain
for
seven
long
days
and
i
quitted
valmont
to
search
for
amusement
and
variety
in
the
park
and
surrounding
woods
i
must
have
been
devoid
of
taste
and
feeling
if
in
viewing
the
exquisite
scenery
of
the
park
i
had
not
forgotten
the
gloomy
entrance
and
the
dreary
building
i
found
a
seat
on
the
margin
of
that
fine
sheet
of
water
which
is
skirted
by
majestic
wood
and
i
rested
there
till
twilight
began
to
spread
itself
over
the
horizon
who
would
not
sibella
although
evening
had
cast
its
misty
shade
over
the
tall
trees
and
impressed
an
awful
serenity
on
every
surrounding
object
who
would
not
i
say
like
me
have
ventured
into
the
wood
rather
than
have
returned
to
and
valmont
and
their
castle
i
found
the
paths
so
admirably
contrived
in
their
breaks
and
windings
that
i
could
not
forbid
myself
to
proceed
every
now
and
then
i
had
an
imperfect
view
of
something
dark
rugged
and
mountainous
on
a
sudden
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
rude
pile
of
stones
seemingly
carried
to
a
tremendous
height
which
as
suddenly
vanished
from
my
sight
amidst
the
intercepting
branches
a
few
steps
further
it
was
again
before
me
as
a
wild
ruin
tottering
on
the
projecting
point
of
a
rock
silence
solitude
the
twilight
the
objects
filled
my
mind
with
a
species
of
melancholy
fancy
had
become
more
predominant
than
judgment
i
slackened
my
pace
i
breathed
heavily
when
suddenly
turning
into
a
new
path
that
i
expected
would
bring
me
to
the
foot
of
the
rock
i
beheld
a
female
form
clothed
in
white
seated
at
the
foot
of
a
large
oak
her
hair
unrestrained
by
either
hat
or
cap
entirely
shaded
her
face
as
she
bowed
her
head
to
look
on
a
little
fawn
who
in
the
attitude
of
confidence
and
affection
was
laying
across
her
lap
the
names
of
wood
nymph
dryad
and
hymadriad
with
a
confused
number
of
images
arose
in
my
memory
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
reverently
retreating
but
a
moment
pause
prevented
the
romance
of
the
fence
from
thus
imposing
on
my
reason
and
i
resolved
to
examine
whether
the
face
like
the
form
bespoke
more
of
divinity
than
of
mortal
as
i
approached
nearer
away
bounded
the
fawn
up
sprang
the
nymph
again
sibella
i
stood
still
unknowing
whether
to
fall
at
your
feet
or
to
clasp
you
in
my
arms
such
was
our
first
romantic
interview
there
was
something
wild
in
your
air
your
language
was
simple
and
concise
yet
delivered
with
an
impressive
eloquence
and
i
thought
you
altogether
a
phenomenon
my
heart
could
not
help
partaking
the
transport
with
which
you
received
my
promise
of
staying
with
you
in
the
wood
yet
it
was
to
me
incomprehensible
how
you
could
talk
so
familiarly
of
roaming
in
woods
at
night
without
seeming
to
know
any
thing
of
the
ideas
of
loneliness
and
apprehension
generally
supposed
to
belong
to
such
situations
but
my
habits
would
not
so
suddenly
yield
to
your
you
saw
that
the
damp
and
darkness
affected
me
and
you
instantly
led
the
way
to
the
castle
but
you
became
silent
you
sighed
you
walked
at
a
greater
distance
from
me
and
i
began
to
fear
lest
you
could
only
submit
to
be
pleased
in
your
own
way
the
instant
we
entered
the
outer
court
of
the
castle
you
seized
my
hand
and
having
pressed
it
forcibly
to
your
bosom
you
darted
through
a
small
side
door
in
the
building
and
closed
it
after
you
i
was
going
to
follow
way
if
you
please
madam
said
the
servant
who
had
been
sent
to
search
for
me
in
the
park
will
accompany
miss
valmont
said
i
valmont
does
not
see
company
madam
replied
the
man
uncle
does
not
permit
it
i
suffered
myself
to
be
conducted
to
the
supper
room
where
i
related
the
manner
of
our
meeting
the
information
you
had
given
me
of
your
relationship
to
valmont
and
finally
i
spoke
of
the
singular
way
in
which
you
had
quitted
me
and
expressed
my
surprise
at
not
finding
you
of
the
supper
party
valmont
said
you
were
a
strange
unformed
child
valmont
would
gladly
have
been
silent
but
as
i
continually
addressed
myself
to
him
he
could
not
rid
himself
without
gross
rudeness
of
the
necessity
of
answering
me
he
spoke
mysteriously
of
his
systems
and
his
plans
of
his
authority
his
wisdom
and
your
dependence
of
his
right
of
choosing
for
you
and
your
positive
duty
of
obeying
him
without
reserve
or
discussion
at
last
with
tones
and
gestures
by
which
i
was
to
understand
that
he
went
to
the
extreme
of
condescension
in
my
favour
he
consented
that
provided
no
other
company
came
to
visit
him
in
the
time
you
should
associate
with
us
while
we
remained
at
valmont
castle
your
very
extraordinary
seclusion
and
your
extraordinary
self
occupied
my
mind
during
the
greatest
part
of
that
night
i
had
found
you
highly
interesting
and
i
believed
you
to
be
infinitely
amiable
i
thought
i
might
embrace
you
as
the
first
choice
of
my
affections
but
i
doubted
whether
you
might
not
if
now
exposed
to
the
glitter
of
the
world
lose
that
vigour
of
feeling
which
in
solitude
made
you
appear
so
singular
so
attractive
i
longed
to
make
the
experiment
for
my
hopes
of
you
were
stronger
than
my
fears
and
as
i
had
so
far
prevailed
on
valmont
i
flattered
myself
i
should
also
prevail
on
him
to
suffer
me
to
conduct
you
from
the
castle
and
these
were
the
motives
this
the
expectation
dearest
sibella
that
withheld
me
from
confessing
in
valmont
woods
i
loved
you
with
all
my
the
seven
days
i
remained
at
the
castle
i
forbore
although
with
difficulty
to
ask
you
questions
that
i
might
gradually
develope
your
character
as
surrounding
circumstances
should
operate
on
your
feelings
sometimes
i
saw
you
devoted
to
me
sometimes
i
saw
your
imagination
soaring
as
it
were
beyond
the
bounds
prescribed
to
your
person
in
search
of
a
remoter
object
why
dear
sibella
are
you
so
pensive
why
do
you
gaze
on
that
portrait
of
yourself
with
so
much
earnestness
and
why
do
you
caress
that
little
fawn
who
wears
a
collar
inscribed
with
the
initials
till
your
eyes
fill
with
tears
let
me
be
the
partaker
of
your
unrestrained
emotions
while
i
who
have
a
wider
range
of
observation
will
place
my
opinions
before
you
without
check
or
limit
our
next
resting
place
is
to
be
the
seat
of
a
nabob
sir
thomas
barlowe
amongst
whose
laboured
pleasures
i
shall
wish
to
return
to
gloomy
valmont
where
i
found
a
felicity
of
which
i
have
no
promise
in
the
scenes
i
am
now
destined
to
partake
adieu
adieu
caroline
ashburn
letter
iv
from
sibella
valmont
to
caroline
ashburn
was
i
pensive
did
i
gaze
did
i
sigh
did
i
weep
when
you
miss
ashburn
were
with
me
what
do
i
know
when
i
have
only
for
companion
the
faithful
the
exquisite
but
torturing
representation
of
memory
can
i
do
more
than
gaze
and
sigh
and
weep
o
yes
i
can
for
miss
ashburn
i
can
raise
altars
on
a
thousand
spots
in
these
woods
which
were
once
hallowed
by
the
footsteps
of
him
i
love
two
years
have
elapsed
since
he
bade
me
farewel
therefore
did
you
see
me
pensive
that
picture
of
me
was
painted
by
himself
therefore
do
i
gaze
on
it
the
fawn
he
took
from
a
dying
mother
by
him
she
was
nourished
into
familiarity
nina
has
ceased
to
mourn
the
absence
of
her
benefactor
she
is
satisfied
with
my
caresses
but
the
heart
of
sibella
valmont
nor
now
nor
ever
can
find
any
substitute
for
her
clement
montgomery
i
was
nearly
six
years
old
when
they
told
me
that
i
had
lost
my
father
he
had
travelled
a
twelvemonth
before
to
foreign
countries
for
the
benefit
of
his
health
and
i
knew
not
that
his
death
more
than
his
absence
would
deprive
me
of
my
happiness
till
my
uncle
valmont
came
and
carried
me
away
in
his
coach
from
my
governess
my
maid
and
all
the
domestics
who
loved
me
and
whom
i
loved
of
my
father
household
then
indeed
i
mourned
and
my
uncle
attempted
to
soothe
me
he
said
i
must
be
happy
for
i
was
now
dependent
upon
him
and
it
was
my
duty
to
love
him
obey
him
and
be
satisfied
my
swelling
heart
revolted
against
being
commanded
to
be
happy
and
i
found
not
one
person
at
the
castle
who
could
supply
to
me
the
want
of
my
kind
governess
and
kind
maid
except
a
little
dog
that
on
my
first
entrance
had
fawned
on
me
as
if
he
wished
to
make
me
happier
him
i
carried
incessantly
in
my
arms
and
i
told
him
whenever
we
were
alone
how
i
longed
to
get
back
to
my
father
house
and
to
carry
him
along
with
me
in
a
fortnight
after
i
arrived
at
valmont
the
affectionate
little
animal
died
and
i
remained
inconsolable
i
was
sitting
weeping
on
the
hall
steps
when
my
uncle
came
to
me
he
wiped
away
my
tears
bade
me
be
cheerful
and
said
he
had
procured
me
a
better
than
fidelle
my
uncle
led
me
with
him
into
the
library
and
presented
me
to
a
boy
three
years
older
than
myself
blooming
blushing
beautiful
is
my
adopted
son
sibella
said
my
uncle
he
will
henceforth
live
with
you
in
the
castle
take
him
out
child
and
show
him
where
you
find
the
prettiest
flowers
and
the
ripest
fruit
ah
need
i
tell
you
how
we
advanced
from
shyness
to
familiarity
from
familiarity
to
kindness
from
kindness
to
love
all
powerful
all
potent
the
castle
then
seemed
no
prison
the
moat
seemed
no
barrier
sometimes
my
uncle
carried
clement
abroad
to
visit
him
but
then
i
was
sure
of
his
return
even
the
hours
of
instruction
i
shared
with
him
he
had
a
good
an
amiable
tutor
who
delighted
in
teaching
to
me
also
every
science
he
taught
to
clement
and
if
valmont
frowned
upon
me
or
checked
my
industry
clement
was
still
at
my
side
and
i
smiled
through
my
tears
thus
passed
away
the
years
from
six
till
sixteen
on
the
day
that
i
became
sixteen
we
had
run
races
with
our
little
fawn
and
having
wearied
ourselves
with
exertion
we
had
lain
down
to
rest
in
each
other
arms
at
the
foot
of
that
oak
where
you
miss
ashburn
first
beheld
me
my
uncle
broke
our
happy
slumbers
he
came
to
the
oak
and
sternly
commanded
clement
to
rise
and
follow
him
i
followed
too
my
uncle
sat
down
in
his
library
and
appeared
to
meditate
while
we
looked
on
each
other
with
love
and
pity
and
on
him
we
looked
with
suspicion
and
affright
when
my
uncle
began
to
speak
clement
trembled
but
all
my
emotions
were
chained
up
in
astonishment
for
i
heard
him
say
that
clement
should
that
day
quit
the
castle
that
he
should
seek
new
companions
new
countries
new
climates
never
i
cried
i
folded
my
arms
round
my
lover
shalt
not
go
clement
i
said
have
world
enough
no
thou
shalt
not
go
my
clement
valmont
furiously
bade
me
desist
but
he
had
awakened
a
dread
in
my
mind
more
powerful
than
my
dread
of
him
for
a
time
i
expostulated
with
vehemence
and
courage
but
i
could
not
repress
my
tears
and
while
i
was
compelled
to
listen
to
my
uncle
his
tone
his
words
impressed
me
with
my
former
awe
of
him
and
rendered
my
remonstrance
timid
and
useless
to
clement
he
said
are
now
to
leave
these
boyish
follies
and
learn
the
duties
of
a
man
you
shall
mix
with
society
but
remember
that
you
are
not
to
be
attracted
by
its
specious
appearances
scrutinize
into
its
follies
and
enormities
as
i
have
done
and
let
my
precepts
and
instructions
be
your
guide
and
law
remember
clement
that
i
took
you
from
poverty
and
obscurity
remember
too
that
on
your
duty
and
gratitude
depends
your
security
that
child
he
pointed
to
me
me
sir
that
child
is
in
future
to
be
considered
only
as
your
sister
for
you
sibella
he
said
to
me
duties
in
life
are
easily
performed
i
have
chosen
a
part
for
you
and
nothing
is
required
of
you
but
obedience
you
have
heard
me
declare
to
clement
and
i
now
repeat
it
to
you
that
to
clement
montgomery
you
are
to
be
no
more
than
a
sister
this
day
he
quits
us
when
he
shall
return
i
have
not
determined
yes
caroline
my
clement
went
two
years
has
he
roamed
in
a
world
which
i
am
forbidden
to
know
but
alike
in
viewing
the
palace
or
the
cottage
the
burning
mountain
or
the
fertile
plain
must
the
idea
of
sibella
accompany
him
our
minds
our
principles
our
affections
are
the
same
and
while
i
trace
his
never
to
be
forgotten
image
within
my
breast
i
know
how
fondly
he
cherishes
the
remembrance
of
mine
caroline
adieu
i
go
to
the
oak
on
that
consecrated
spot
mountains
seas
continents
dissolve
and
my
spirit
unites
with
his
sibella
valmont
letter
v
from
caroline
ashburn
to
sibella
valmont
yes
dearest
sibella
charming
sibella
in
that
one
short
but
rapid
sentence
you
have
taught
me
to
understand
your
progress
shyness
to
familiarity
from
familiarity
to
kindness
from
kindness
to
love
all
powerful
all
oh
be
that
love
happy
in
its
continuance
as
at
its
commencement
be
it
the
pure
garb
of
your
clement
soul
upon
which
vice
shall
leave
no
spot
nor
wrinkle
be
it
as
you
say
that
hearts
your
affections
your
principles
are
the
and
i
would
trust
this
lover
amidst
allurements
such
as
virtue
held
seldom
rejected
had
seldom
turned
from
without
contamination
your
uncle
my
sibella
i
perceive
intended
you
for
your
lover
and
your
lover
for
you
his
project
then
was
to
place
a
second
adam
and
eve
in
the
garden
of
eden
well
sibella
innocence
remains
with
you
your
eden
will
yet
bloom
for
trust
me
innocence
and
happiness
can
not
long
be
separated
why
will
that
uncle
of
your
so
strenuously
uphold
his
mysterious
reserve
and
silence
i
long
to
ask
him
a
million
of
questions
and
he
knows
that
i
do
and
he
wishes
that
i
should
it
is
not
because
he
is
altogether
convinced
of
the
wisdom
and
utility
of
his
plans
that
he
does
plan
it
is
that
he
will
oppose
himself
to
general
customs
and
general
experience
it
is
singularity
and
not
perfection
that
he
is
in
search
of
and
since
experience
formerly
taught
him
that
even
the
renowned
name
of
valmont
might
mix
undistinguished
with
a
herd
of
less
illustrious
names
he
now
bravely
resolves
to
enforce
the
wonder
of
his
compeers
if
he
can
not
claim
their
reverence
perhaps
with
the
flattering
promises
of
success
he
sometimes
soothes
the
rancour
of
his
solitude
and
occasionally
indeed
his
existence
is
remembered
and
his
whimsies
are
made
the
subject
of
ridicule
contempt
and
laughter
but
some
novel
circumstance
such
as
the
gay
ashburn
visit
to
his
gloomy
retirement
must
call
them
into
this
remembrance
or
the
name
of
valmont
would
rest
as
undisturbed
as
does
in
every
memory
but
his
own
the
deeds
of
his
forefathers
it
is
to
my
mother
excursion
to
valmont
castle
that
i
owe
the
felicity
of
calling
you
my
friend
it
is
to
her
escape
from
thence
as
she
herself
terms
it
that
i
owe
my
knowledge
of
valmont
history
surrounded
on
her
arrival
at
the
house
of
sir
thomas
barlowe
by
a
crowd
of
visitors
as
gay
profuse
and
dissipated
as
herself
she
hastens
to
communicate
her
joy
at
the
agreeable
change
and
to
inveigh
against
the
morose
valmont
and
his
insipid
wife
a
conversation
ensued
of
some
length
for
such
a
subject
during
which
i
discovered
that
two
of
the
party
the
earl
of
ulson
and
colonel
ridson
were
once
the
intimate
companions
of
valmont
the
former
of
these
gentlemen
appeared
eager
to
place
his
defects
in
the
strongest
point
of
view
while
the
latter
with
less
zeal
to
be
sure
but
with
a
sweetness
of
temper
infinitely
endearing
was
willing
to
smooth
the
rugged
parts
of
valmont
character
and
to
place
a
vice
behind
the
glare
of
a
virtue
by
setting
aside
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
the
exaggerations
and
making
also
some
allowance
for
the
palliative
temper
of
colonel
ridson
i
had
succeeded
in
learning
as
much
of
history
as
enables
me
to
form
some
and
i
believe
no
inaccurate
estimate
of
his
worth
abilities
and
character
your
grandfather
sibella
a
being
quite
as
eccentric
tho
less
whimsical
than
your
uncle
lived
in
the
castle
you
now
inhabit
nor
would
he
of
his
own
free
will
have
quitted
that
castle
for
heaven
itself
every
stone
of
the
building
that
had
kept
its
station
in
times
of
turbulence
and
discord
against
the
attack
of
an
enemy
was
to
him
an
idol
if
he
was
thoughtful
it
was
in
recalling
the
great
deeds
of
his
ancestors
if
he
was
talkative
it
was
on
the
same
theme
if
he
had
wishes
they
were
that
he
had
lived
in
those
glorious
days
when
fighting
well
was
the
most
eminent
of
virtues
and
a
strong
fortified
castle
and
obedient
vassals
the
most
valuable
of
possessions
as
is
the
established
practice
in
families
of
such
renown
and
dignity
as
that
to
which
you
my
friend
appertain
the
first
born
son
of
your
grandfather
was
the
only
hope
the
only
joy
the
only
object
of
the
careful
solitude
of
his
anxious
parents
while
your
father
coming
into
the
world
two
years
after
his
brother
was
adored
flattered
and
spoiled
by
no
creature
but
his
nurse
your
uncle
i
understand
received
a
stately
kind
of
education
within
the
castle
walls
and
your
father
happier
because
of
less
consequence
passed
his
early
years
with
other
young
men
of
fashion
at
school
and
at
college
valmont
was
not
a
whit
behind
his
father
in
his
veneration
for
high
birth
but
he
could
not
boast
so
unqualified
a
love
of
fruits
of
armour
nor
did
he
think
that
civil
war
was
the
only
time
when
a
man
could
gather
honours
worthy
of
a
distinguished
name
no
sooner
was
your
uncle
emancipated
from
the
fetters
of
his
minority
than
he
resolved
to
repair
to
court
where
he
expected
to
find
only
his
equals
and
those
equals
alive
to
and
exact
in
the
observance
of
all
that
haughty
decorum
which
valmont
deemed
indispensably
necessary
to
the
well
being
of
social
institutions
poor
man
he
feels
himself
lost
in
the
motley
multitude
sees
his
pretensions
to
notice
and
deference
pushed
aside
by
individuals
obscure
in
their
origin
but
renowned
for
artful
intrigues
for
bold
perseverance
and
dazzling
success
shocked
at
the
contaminating
mixture
he
had
fled
back
with
precipitancy
to
his
castle
but
love
detained
him
for
he
had
made
an
offering
of
his
heart
to
a
woman
of
rank
and
fashion
nothing
could
be
more
unfortunate
than
this
passion
nothing
further
from
congeniality
than
the
minds
and
manners
of
lady
margaret
b
and
valmont
he
just
risen
as
it
were
from
the
tomb
of
his
progenitors
loaded
with
the
punctilio
of
the
last
age
recoiling
from
the
salute
of
every
man
who
could
not
boast
an
unblemished
pedigree
and
lastly
and
most
worthily
possessing
refined
ideas
of
female
delicacy
of
honourable
love
and
of
unchanging
fidelity
and
she
on
the
contrary
a
graceful
coquette
without
an
atom
of
real
tenderness
in
her
heart
and
valuing
her
rank
merely
as
it
gave
her
opportunities
of
extending
her
conquest
lady
margaret
b
was
highly
diverted
with
valmont
formalities
and
in
spite
of
the
torture
her
dissipated
coquettish
manners
inflicted
on
him
she
had
sufficient
power
to
make
him
the
most
ardent
of
her
lovers
in
fine
she
rejected
him
laughed
at
him
despised
him
i
could
not
hear
this
anecdote
nor
can
i
repeat
it
without
a
sensation
of
pain
so
strongly
do
i
enter
into
the
irritable
feelings
of
your
uncle
when
hitherto
accustomed
only
to
receive
homage
and
obedience
he
is
at
once
foiled
in
his
ambition
by
low
born
courtiers
and
betrayed
in
his
love
by
a
high
born
jilt
valmont
consulted
no
other
guide
than
his
passions
and
instantly
drew
an
angry
and
false
picture
of
mankind
with
such
people
as
i
have
spoken
of
he
could
not
associate
for
their
vices
he
abhorred
but
his
mind
had
not
fortitude
enough
had
not
comprehension
enough
to
cast
aside
his
own
prejudices
and
instead
of
attempting
to
reform
mankind
he
retires
to
rail
at
them
and
carries
with
him
the
pride
selfishness
and
love
of
power
in
which
all
the
vices
of
society
originate
wrapped
in
the
impenetrable
selfishness
of
high
birth
valmont
denies
the
possibility
of
eminent
virtue
existing
without
rank
who
shall
presume
to
arraign
his
principles
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
his
actions
to
teach
him
his
duty
i
stand
cries
valmont
within
the
sacred
verge
of
nobility
look
on
that
coat
of
arms
i
derive
from
the
normans
wisdom
in
rags
keep
off
true
his
ancestors
conquered
that
he
should
be
wise
oh
cede
to
him
the
palm
bind
his
brows
with
the
laurel
after
a
few
months
retirement
valmont
ventured
once
more
into
the
heterogeneous
multitude
in
search
of
a
wife
for
i
suspect
he
found
himself
as
ill
qualified
for
solitude
as
society
beside
he
had
formed
the
virtuous
project
of
instructing
a
new
race
to
put
the
old
world
out
of
countenance
i
can
not
but
pause
to
reflect
upon
your
uncle
toils
in
search
of
his
help
mate
he
must
have
a
wife
whose
pedigree
his
future
sons
might
place
beside
his
own
and
he
must
have
one
of
a
temperament
and
character
opposite
to
that
of
lady
margaret
b
and
his
good
stars
his
ill
stars
or
whatever
else
you
please
led
him
to
the
feet
of
valmont
it
is
true
your
aunt
was
neither
as
coquettish
nor
had
she
the
sprightly
wit
nor
the
mischievous
gaiety
of
lady
margaret
but
she
loved
crowds
detested
solitude
and
was
a
votary
of
dissipation
to
convince
her
how
much
he
had
studied
her
inclinations
and
how
much
he
meant
to
gratify
them
no
sooner
was
valmont
in
possession
of
his
bride
then
he
snatched
her
from
the
scenes
where
her
existence
was
alone
valuable
to
her
and
buried
her
amidst
obscurity
and
horror
at
valmont
castle
what
is
the
consequence
she
had
no
mental
accomplishments
in
reserve
for
their
mutual
benefit
and
delight
nor
had
he
mind
enough
to
steal
fire
from
heaven
and
animate
with
life
the
marble
from
the
struggle
of
tempers
and
the
warfare
of
words
she
droops
into
an
hypocondriac
he
degenerates
into
a
cynic
proud
of
himself
alone
among
the
disappointments
produced
by
this
marriage
the
want
of
children
was
the
most
offensive
to
valmont
your
father
who
had
pursued
a
course
of
life
quite
different
from
his
brother
tasting
all
the
excesses
of
dissipation
died
and
very
improperly
in
my
opinion
left
you
to
the
guardianship
of
your
uncle
that
valmont
should
adopt
a
son
from
the
lowly
condition
of
a
cottager
child
has
occasioned
much
wonder
and
many
surmises
however
as
i
do
not
find
any
thing
material
either
to
you
or
me
in
the
conjectures
i
have
listened
to
on
this
occasion
i
shall
not
be
at
the
pains
of
relating
them
but
how
comes
it
to
pass
my
dearest
sibella
that
when
your
uncle
had
the
means
of
gratifying
his
darling
wish
in
educating
two
children
and
one
of
them
a
female
to
whom
according
to
his
creed
nothing
should
be
granted
beyond
what
the
instinct
of
appetite
demands
how
comes
it
i
say
that
you
possess
the
comprehensive
powers
of
intellect
from
what
sources
did
you
derive
that
eager
desire
of
knowledge
of
which
i
find
you
possessed
and
how
came
you
to
be
learned
on
subjects
which
in
the
education
of
females
are
strictly
withheld
to
make
room
for
trifling
gaudy
and
useless
acomplishments
tell
me
by
what
miracle
i
find
you
such
as
you
are
and
let
me
cease
to
wonder
at
you
but
never
let
me
cease
to
love
you
tell
me
too
how
came
you
to
be
dependent
on
your
uncle
does
your
dependence
only
mean
the
protection
due
from
him
who
stands
in
the
place
of
a
parent
to
you
i
wish
to
be
informed
what
explanation
valmont
and
yourself
affix
to
the
term
of
dependent
when
it
is
applied
to
you
for
colonel
ridson
talks
so
familiarly
of
the
fortune
you
must
possess
from
your
mother
and
also
the
wealth
of
the
valmont
family
which
he
says
is
yours
by
heirship
that
i
must
own
i
am
puzzled
i
care
little
about
your
being
rich
but
is
seems
unnatural
and
unjust
to
have
you
a
dependent
on
your
haughty
uncle
ah
my
dear
sibella
how
often
in
a
day
do
i
feast
my
imagination
by
allowing
it
to
bear
me
back
to
you
and
yet
perhaps
our
separation
gives
a
spur
a
stimulus
to
our
friendship
i
am
not
convinced
indeed
but
that
temporary
separations
are
even
useful
between
lovers
and
that
valmont
may
have
acted
rather
wisely
than
otherwise
in
parting
you
and
your
clement
for
a
season
why
he
should
bid
you
remember
him
only
as
a
brother
is
really
too
far
plunged
into
obscurity
for
me
to
discover
do
not
however
suppose
for
an
instant
that
my
affection
for
you
would
decay
were
i
at
liberty
to
enjoy
your
society
as
i
wish
on
the
contrary
i
am
persuaded
that
every
hour
i
should
pass
with
you
would
add
something
to
my
improvement
and
render
us
more
valuable
to
each
other
my
expression
arose
from
my
being
at
that
moment
in
idea
a
partner
of
your
seclusion
and
feeling
that
i
should
want
in
the
same
situation
that
energy
and
activity
which
is
the
support
of
your
solitude
i
am
fond
of
society
and
indeed
i
find
myself
most
excited
when
i
have
most
opportunities
of
observing
the
various
characters
and
pursuits
of
those
around
me
gladly
would
i
possess
the
power
of
selecting
my
society
from
that
happy
privilege
i
am
debarred
but
i
seldom
make
one
of
a
circle
in
which
i
do
not
find
some
novelty
of
character
and
something
either
of
excellence
or
absurdity
from
which
i
may
draw
improvement
yet
a
two
month
visit
at
the
villa
of
sir
thomas
barlowe
is
rather
a
hard
trial
of
my
patience
and
unless
we
are
enlivened
by
new
visitors
i
fear
the
company
here
will
afford
me
but
a
trifling
harvest
of
observation
i
shall
soon
be
glad
to
turn
from
them
to
my
own
resources
and
fly
even
oftener
than
i
now
do
to
the
ever
vivifying
remembrance
of
my
sibella
sir
thomas
barlowe
has
risen
from
some
very
obscure
station
to
the
wealth
and
dignity
of
a
nabob
he
has
risen
too
i
greatly
fear
by
the
same
depredating
practices
which
the
unfortunate
natives
of
india
seem
destined
constantly
to
suffer
from
those
who
perfidiously
call
themselves
the
protectors
of
the
country
sir
thomas
barlowe
riches
have
become
his
punishment
each
morning
his
fears
awaken
with
his
faculties
lest
that
day
should
bring
tidings
of
the
dreaded
scrutiny
and
when
evening
arrives
and
he
struggles
to
yield
himself
to
mirth
and
wine
amidst
the
circle
he
has
assiduously
gathered
round
him
a
word
a
look
or
the
most
remote
hint
or
allusion
gives
his
watchful
terrors
an
alarm
a
sudden
turn
of
his
head
perchance
discovers
his
shadow
on
the
wall
legions
of
threatening
phantoms
then
crowd
upon
his
apprehension
and
the
evening
yet
more
miserable
than
the
day
concludes
with
an
opiate
administered
to
lull
the
feeble
body
into
lethargy
and
hush
the
perturbed
conscience
into
silence
and
my
mother
can
look
on
this
existing
fact
with
indifference
while
i
shudder
those
enormous
sums
of
wealth
she
lavishes
away
that
cluster
of
pearls
she
triumphantly
places
in
her
hair
those
diamonds
heaped
into
different
ornaments
how
were
they
obtained
thousands
perhaps
oh
sibella
i
have
laid
aside
my
ornaments
a
dress
plain
as
your
supersedes
them
lady
barlowe
is
a
composition
of
a
very
curious
kind
she
is
about
forty
years
younger
than
her
husband
is
tolerably
pretty
and
has
a
showy
talent
of
repartee
that
she
mistakes
for
a
sublime
genius
and
her
inclinations
are
perpetually
at
warfare
without
being
able
to
decide
whether
she
shall
be
most
renowned
as
a
wit
or
a
beauty
she
is
extravagantly
fond
of
admiration
which
she
formerly
enjoyed
unlimitedly
being
the
head
toast
of
a
small
county
town
till
she
became
the
wife
of
a
nabob
prosperity
has
not
increased
her
happiness
for
in
the
great
and
gay
world
she
has
found
rivals
of
such
magnitude
that
malice
and
envy
have
strung
up
within
that
bosom
which
till
now
owned
no
inmate
but
vanity
these
are
our
host
and
hostess
the
first
in
precedency
among
the
visitors
ranks
the
earl
of
ulson
an
antiquated
gallant
who
in
public
affects
not
to
feel
the
approaches
of
age
and
in
private
broods
over
the
consciousness
of
its
effects
till
he
sickens
with
ill
nature
the
countess
of
ulson
hates
her
husband
nor
has
she
over
much
charity
and
towards
other
men
she
talks
largely
indeed
of
her
piety
and
the
strict
performance
of
her
manifold
duties
this
amiable
pair
are
attended
by
their
son
and
two
daughters
lord
bowden
is
so
perfectly
satisfied
within
himself
that
if
you
will
take
his
word
for
it
there
is
not
a
more
amiable
and
accomplished
young
man
in
england
his
eldest
sister
lady
mary
bowden
claims
no
praise
beyond
what
is
justly
due
to
the
complacency
of
her
temper
she
is
at
once
too
giddy
and
too
indolent
to
aim
at
meriting
a
more
enlarged
praise
she
loves
dress
company
cards
and
scandal
and
indulges
herself
in
the
use
of
the
latter
as
a
mere
matter
of
course
without
entertaining
the
smallest
particle
of
towards
the
very
persons
she
helps
to
vilify
i
have
endeavoured
to
convince
lady
mary
of
the
folly
of
this
practice
and
she
acknowledges
that
what
i
say
appears
very
much
to
the
purpose
but
then
how
can
she
cease
to
do
what
every
body
does
all
the
beauty
that
exact
regularity
of
feature
and
transparency
of
complexion
can
bestow
is
in
the
possession
of
the
earl
of
youngest
daughter
lady
laura
bowden
beyond
this
description
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
of
her
i
can
perceive
she
entertains
a
very
hearty
contempt
for
her
sister
and
perhaps
she
may
hold
me
in
as
little
estimation
but
a
woman
so
perfectly
well
bred
as
lady
laura
does
not
display
such
sentiments
if
she
entertains
them
unless
some
species
of
rivalship
should
unfortunately
call
her
passions
into
action
i
do
not
think
her
either
witty
or
wise
yet
i
have
been
told
she
bears
the
reputation
of
the
former
and
is
poet
enough
occasionally
to
pen
a
rebus
or
an
acrostic
it
may
be
so
i
have
not
been
favoured
with
her
confidence
a
delicate
languor
pervades
her
manners
and
this
is
generally
honoured
with
the
name
of
sensibility
i
am
apt
to
call
it
affectation
for
the
sensibility
that
i
understand
and
admire
is
extreme
only
in
proportion
to
the
greatness
of
the
occasion
it
does
not
waste
itself
in
vapours
nor
is
it
ever
on
the
watch
for
wasps
and
spiders
colonel
ridson
assures
me
that
lady
laura
bowden
is
admired
by
the
whole
world
and
that
he
must
be
the
happiest
of
men
on
whom
her
ladyship
bestows
a
preference
colonel
ridson
loves
his
white
teeth
and
his
epaulet
he
likes
every
body
praises
every
body
is
attentive
to
every
body
lives
without
attachment
and
will
probably
die
in
the
same
torpid
state
without
ever
knowing
felicity
or
ordinary
misfortune
the
colonel
hitherto
has
been
the
only
unmarried
man
amongst
us
except
lord
bowden
who
really
is
so
assiduous
in
remembering
his
own
recommendations
that
no
one
else
finds
it
necessary
to
remember
him
or
them
at
all
but
we
are
now
to
be
enlivened
it
seems
we
damsels
are
to
be
excited
to
call
forth
our
charms
for
the
conquest
of
a
youth
of
no
common
value
as
his
fame
goes
here
sir
thomas
barlowe
nephew
murden
arrived
at
the
villa
this
very
day
i
know
not
why
i
should
be
particularly
selected
from
the
party
by
sir
thomas
barlowe
to
listen
to
his
encomiums
on
this
nephew
from
the
most
insignificant
occurrences
the
baronet
has
constantly
occasion
to
say
ha
miss
ashburn
if
my
nephew
arthur
was
but
come
if
i
praised
a
dish
of
fruit
at
table
the
nabob
nephew
arthur
had
certainly
done
the
same
thing
let
me
speak
of
walking
or
riding
let
me
complain
of
hail
rain
or
sunshine
arthur
was
still
my
promised
chaperon
the
future
of
all
my
grievances
me
something
said
i
one
day
to
colonel
ridson
this
murden
this
hope
of
the
family
is
very
handsome
replied
the
colonel
is
he
good
amiable
wise
a
miracle
madam
replied
the
colonel
good
amiable
wise
who
could
desire
more
lady
mary
bowden
stood
beside
me
one
afternoon
while
the
baronet
was
reminding
me
of
his
dear
arthur
thomas
i
believe
intends
said
i
to
her
i
shall
be
in
love
by
anticipation
you
know
murden
what
is
he
cried
lady
mary
lifting
up
her
right
hand
to
enforce
the
spirit
of
her
emphasis
is
the
most
abominable
rake
in
the
universe
i
absolutely
started
is
possible
lady
mary
you
should
mean
what
you
say
i
asked
after
a
moment
pause
certainly
replied
her
ladyship
quite
gaily
body
knows
of
hundreds
with
whom
he
has
been
a
very
happy
man
do
not
want
said
i
hear
what
every
body
says
i
want
lady
mary
to
know
your
own
sincere
opinion
of
murden
if
you
have
already
told
me
a
fact
my
situation
to
be
sure
will
oblige
me
to
be
sometimes
in
his
company
but
in
that
case
there
exists
not
a
reptile
however
noxious
or
despicable
from
whom
i
should
shrink
with
more
abhorrence
than
from
this
boasted
nephew
of
the
nabob
god
cried
lady
mary
what
did
i
say
i
protest
i
have
forgotten
already
i
am
sure
i
know
no
harm
in
the
world
of
mr
murden
not
you
tell
me
he
was
an
abominable
rake
say
so
replied
lady
mary
certainly
is
very
engaging
he
admires
fine
women
but
i
do
know
whether
he
has
ever
made
serious
addresses
to
any
one
miss
ashburn
i
tell
you
a
secret
had
better
not
i
do
keep
secrets
all
the
world
knows
it
already
lady
laura
is
quite
fond
of
murden
you
would
have
laughed
to
have
seen
her
last
winter
as
i
did
plunged
over
head
and
ears
in
sentiment
and
sensibility
well
i
do
hate
affectation
you
do
love
good
nature
i
do
said
she
smiling
i
hope
with
all
my
heart
that
my
poor
sister
may
now
secure
her
conquest
unless
indeed
miss
ashburn
it
should
interfere
with
you
neither
the
baronet
hints
the
colonel
all
good
all
wise
nor
the
motley
dubious
character
given
by
lady
mary
bowden
of
murden
would
have
tempted
me
to
devote
thus
much
of
my
paper
to
him
i
have
other
inducements
i
have
heard
that
the
domestics
of
barlowe
hall
anxiously
expected
the
day
of
his
coming
a
gardener
who
has
been
discharged
for
no
worse
fault
i
believe
than
his
being
too
old
assures
himself
that
the
prosperity
of
him
and
his
family
will
be
restored
when
murden
arrives
i
have
heard
also
that
the
neighbouring
cottagers
bless
him
such
a
man
must
have
worth
agnes
who
is
zealous
to
tell
me
all
the
good
she
can
of
any
one
has
related
several
anecdotes
of
murden
from
which
i
learn
that
he
possesses
sympathy
and
benevolence
i
can
not
tell
how
such
qualities
can
exist
in
the
mind
of
a
man
who
is
either
in
principle
or
practice
a
libertine
yet
agnes
also
had
been
told
that
murden
was
a
libertine
i
bade
her
enquire
more
and
she
could
hear
of
no
particular
instances
wherein
the
peace
of
individuals
or
families
had
been
injured
by
him
still
those
with
whom
agnes
conversed
bestowed
on
him
this
hateful
title
i
fear
the
reproach
may
belong
to
him
young
men
are
frequently
carried
into
these
excesses
from
the
pernicious
effect
of
example
sometimes
from
vanity
and
from
a
variety
of
other
causes
all
which
tend
to
one
uniform
effect
to
destroy
the
understanding
deprave
the
heart
corrupt
the
disposition
and
render
loathsome
and
detestable
a
being
that
might
have
lived
an
honour
and
a
blessing
to
his
species
if
murden
is
indeed
devoted
to
this
error
farewel
to
his
benevolent
virtues
to
his
sense
of
justice
and
farewel
to
the
pleasure
and
instruction
i
might
have
gained
in
the
society
of
a
virtuous
man
i
said
murden
was
already
arrived
but
i
have
not
seen
him
he
paid
his
duty
to
his
uncle
in
the
baronet
own
apartment
and
then
retired
to
dress
before
he
would
present
himself
in
the
breakfast
parlour
lady
laura
appeared
impatient
she
was
adorned
in
a
new
morning
dress
perfectly
graceful
and
becoming
the
hour
came
in
which
i
was
to
write
to
my
sibella
and
i
would
not
sacrifice
that
employment
for
twenty
such
introductions
farewel
my
friend
close
to
your
altar
of
love
raise
one
of
friendship
and
i
also
will
meet
you
at
the
oak
caroline
ashburn
letter
vi
from
sibella
valmont
to
caroline
ashburn
a
confused
recollection
sprang
up
in
my
mind
when
you
questioned
me
concerning
my
dependence
on
the
day
of
his
last
departure
my
father
caressed
me
fondly
he
held
me
a
long
time
in
his
arms
and
he
shed
tears
over
me
he
spoke
likewise
at
intervals
not
perhaps
with
any
expectation
of
being
understood
by
me
but
to
relieve
the
weighty
pressure
of
his
thoughts
i
well
remember
that
he
named
my
uncle
he
had
many
papers
on
a
table
before
him
and
i
think
there
was
a
connection
in
his
discourse
between
them
and
me
i
believe
he
spoke
of
some
disposition
of
his
fortune
but
the
time
is
now
remote
and
the
idea
is
indistinct
i
can
not
cloathe
it
in
expression
i
do
not
possess
a
fortune
for
my
uncle
calls
me
dependent
talks
of
obligations
i
owe
to
him
for
the
gratification
of
my
wants
he
talks
of
obligations
who
denies
me
instruction
equality
and
my
clement
he
provides
me
food
and
raiment
are
there
not
thousands
in
the
world
where
you
and
clement
live
who
supply
such
wants
by
labour
and
i
too
could
labour
let
valmont
retire
to
the
shelter
of
his
canopy
and
the
luxury
of
down
i
can
make
the
tree
my
shade
and
the
moss
my
pillow
valmont
calls
himself
my
father
and
himself
such
he
there
rests
satisfied
cold
in
his
temperament
stern
from
his
education
he
imagines
kindness
would
be
indulgence
and
indulgence
folly
ever
on
the
watch
for
faults
the
accent
of
reproof
mingles
with
his
best
commendations
he
demands
my
obedience
too
what
obedience
the
grateful
tribute
to
duty
authorised
by
reason
and
sanctioned
by
the
affections
no
valmont
here
at
least
ceases
to
be
inconsistent
he
never
enlightened
my
understanding
nor
conciliated
my
affections
and
he
demands
only
the
obedience
of
a
fettered
slave
i
am
held
in
the
bondage
of
slavery
and
still
may
valmont
power
constrain
the
forces
of
this
body
but
where
miss
ashburn
is
the
tyrant
that
could
ever
chain
thought
or
put
fetters
on
the
fancy
i
charge
you
cease
to
repeat
my
uncle
useless
prohibition
that
i
should
remember
clement
otherwise
than
as
a
brother
let
him
give
his
barrier
to
the
waves
arrest
the
strong
air
in
its
current
but
dream
not
of
placing
limits
to
the
love
of
clement
and
sibella
do
i
weary
you
with
this
endless
topic
you
read
the
world
i
my
own
heart
imprisoned
during
so
many
years
within
the
narrow
boundary
of
this
castle
and
its
parks
the
same
objects
eternally
before
me
i
look
with
disgust
from
their
perpetual
round
of
succession
nature
herself
spring
summer
autumn
degenerate
into
sameness
where
must
i
turn
me
then
but
to
the
resources
of
my
own
heart
love
has
enriched
it
and
friendship
will
not
reject
its
offerings
yes
they
are
many
my
caroline
various
and
increasing
shall
my
uncle
tell
me
that
my
actions
are
confined
to
the
mechanical
operations
of
the
body
that
i
am
an
imbecile
creature
but
a
reptile
of
more
graceful
form
the
half
finished
work
of
nature
and
destitute
of
the
noblest
ornament
of
humanity
blind
to
conviction
grown
old
in
error
he
would
degrade
me
to
the
subordinate
station
he
describes
he
daringly
asserts
that
i
am
born
to
the
exercise
of
no
will
to
the
exercise
of
no
duties
but
submission
that
wisdom
owns
me
not
knows
me
not
could
not
find
in
me
a
resting
place
is
false
caroline
i
feel
within
the
vivifying
principle
of
intellectual
life
my
expanding
faculties
are
nurtured
by
the
passing
hours
and
want
but
the
beams
of
instruction
to
ripen
into
power
and
energy
that
would
steep
my
present
inactive
life
in
forgetfulness
bonneville
when
shall
i
cease
to
love
thy
memory
to
recal
thy
lessons
it
was
thou
bonneville
who
first
bade
me
cherish
this
stimulating
principle
who
called
the
powers
of
my
mind
forth
from
the
chaos
wherewith
valmont
had
enveloped
them
thou
bonneville
taught
me
that
i
make
an
unimpaired
of
the
vast
brotherhood
of
human
kind
that
i
am
a
being
whose
mistakes
demand
the
conviction
of
reason
but
whose
mind
ought
not
to
bow
down
under
power
and
prejudice
he
of
whom
i
speak
miss
ashburn
was
chosen
to
be
clement
tutor
can
you
conceive
the
sensations
which
swell
within
my
breast
while
i
recal
the
memory
of
this
friend
of
my
infancy
my
friend
ere
i
lost
clement
ere
i
knew
you
caroline
methinks
i
hear
his
voice
i
see
his
gestures
again
he
enters
the
wood
path
again
i
behold
that
countenance
beautiful
in
age
radiant
in
he
speaks
my
soul
hangs
on
his
utterance
all
my
lesser
affections
fade
away
ah
no
no
no
bonneville
is
gone
for
ever
clement
is
torn
from
me
you
are
interdicted
and
i
am
alone
in
the
wood
path
i
hailed
him
by
the
name
of
father
he
called
me
his
child
he
was
enervated
with
disease
the
chill
damps
of
evening
pierced
him
the
wintry
blast
shook
his
feeble
frame
still
would
he
endure
the
damps
of
evening
and
tremble
under
the
cold
blast
rather
than
sibella
should
be
sunk
in
ignorance
and
sloth
for
her
cruel
uncle
had
forbidden
her
an
entrance
into
that
apartment
where
bonneville
gave
clement
his
daily
instruction
five
days
passed
away
and
clement
had
not
met
his
tutor
in
the
library
five
long
evenings
clement
had
taken
his
usual
rides
with
valmont
yet
no
bonneville
had
visited
the
oak
my
mind
anticipated
the
hour
of
his
approach
and
mourned
its
disappointment
my
questions
accumulated
i
stored
up
demand
upon
demand
i
recalled
the
subject
of
all
our
conversations
i
carefully
selected
for
another
investigation
those
parts
which
i
had
not
fully
comprehended
i
arranged
my
doubts
and
perhaps
had
never
so
prepared
my
mind
for
improvement
as
when
i
heard
that
bonneville
was
in
bed
ill
dying
i
flew
to
his
apartment
clement
followed
me
we
saw
him
die
father
my
father
i
cried
will
not
leave
us
we
are
your
children
better
were
it
that
we
should
die
with
you
than
be
left
without
you
my
father
my
father
sobs
and
tears
could
not
delay
the
inexorable
moment
and
my
life
seemed
to
fade
from
me
when
i
found
that
his
lips
were
closed
for
would
you
believe
that
my
uncle
yes
you
would
believe
for
you
know
his
haughty
sternness
but
no
matter
is
past
and
ought
to
be
forgotten
but
a
few
days
and
not
an
eye
save
mine
wept
for
the
absence
of
bonneville
clement
was
satisfied
with
a
new
tutor
the
new
tutor
was
wise
good
and
kind
for
clement
said
so
but
he
strictly
obeyed
valmont
and
sibella
was
abandoned
of
guide
of
father
death
an
object
new
hideous
and
awfully
mysterious
was
now
ever
before
me
multitudes
of
dark
perplexing
ideas
succeeded
each
other
in
my
mind
with
a
rapidity
which
doubt
and
dissatisfaction
created
is
it
said
i
to
myself
what
cause
can
produce
an
effect
so
overwhelming
throughout
life
the
mind
invariably
rules
the
functions
of
the
body
it
transports
itself
from
and
returns
to
its
abode
at
pleasure
it
can
look
back
on
the
past
or
fly
forward
to
the
future
it
passes
all
boundary
of
place
creates
or
annihilates
and
soars
or
dives
into
other
worlds
yet
in
one
moment
its
wearied
tool
the
body
had
extinguished
these
omnipotent
powers
and
to
me
quenched
its
vast
energies
for
ever
i
wrung
my
hands
in
bitterness
and
in
anguish
of
heart
and
i
called
loudly
on
the
name
of
my
lost
instructor
for
i
had
now
no
instructor
caroline
do
not
expect
me
to
speak
again
of
bonneville
the
tumult
the
perplexity
returns
and
no
solution
is
at
hand
to
soothe
or
to
cheer
me
seventeen
days
valmont
his
steward
and
their
labourers
have
occupied
my
wood
my
uncle
himself
gave
me
a
command
not
to
appear
there
during
the
i
said
night
sir
i
am
i
hope
at
liberty
are
child
my
uncle
replied
and
i
failed
not
to
avail
myself
of
the
privilege
on
the
rising
ground
of
the
broad
wood
path
and
nearly
opposite
to
my
oak
i
found
the
earth
dug
away
and
preparations
made
of
which
i
could
not
give
an
explanation
but
from
the
progress
of
a
few
days
labour
a
small
beautiful
edifice
of
white
marble
gradually
rose
under
the
shade
of
a
clump
of
yew
trees
whose
branches
were
reflected
on
the
polished
surface
as
in
a
mirror
its
structure
appeared
to
me
beautiful
i
was
charmed
with
it
as
a
novel
object
i
rejoiced
that
it
was
so
near
my
oak
but
i
stood
utterly
at
a
loss
when
i
attempted
to
form
an
opinion
of
its
design
or
utility
perhaps
when
you
were
at
the
castle
you
became
acquainted
with
the
defects
and
singularities
of
the
two
attendants
whom
my
uncle
assigned
me
andrew
almost
inflexible
in
silence
attempts
when
i
put
him
to
the
trial
to
explain
himself
by
signs
while
his
daughter
possesses
not
that
i
could
ever
discover
in
the
smallest
degree
the
faculty
of
hearing
andrew
often
looks
on
me
with
affection
but
margaret
who
has
a
most
repulsive
countenance
and
demeanour
appears
even
while
i
endeavour
to
conciliate
her
by
kind
looks
to
be
scarcely
conscious
that
i
am
in
existence
with
such
companions
intercourse
is
rigorously
excluded
in
cases
of
peculiar
uncertainty
i
sometimes
venture
to
apply
to
andrew
as
i
did
on
the
morning
after
i
had
seen
the
beautiful
edifice
in
the
wood
path
completed
andrew
said
is
a
tomb
shortly
after
i
called
at
valmont
door
to
inquire
of
her
health
for
she
is
now
recovering
slowly
from
a
severe
indisposition
very
unusually
she
desired
i
might
be
admitted
i
stood
while
i
spoke
to
her
for
the
wood
was
at
liberty
and
i
was
impatient
to
be
gone
the
surprise
of
andrew
concise
information
was
new
in
my
mind
and
i
began
to
describe
the
structure
in
the
wood
path
i
perceived
attendant
directing
strange
looks
and
gestures
to
me
and
i
paused
to
ask
her
meaning
she
positively
denied
the
circumstance
and
i
proceeded
when
i
mentioned
the
name
of
valmont
started
forward
on
the
couch
where
she
sat
a
tomb
cried
she
whom
and
then
again
falling
back
in
seeming
agony
she
added
without
waiting
for
my
reply
i
know
it
well
he
has
opened
a
tomb
for
me
you
madam
i
said
are
not
yet
dead
exclaimed
valmont
looking
fiercely
on
me
yet
dead
insolent
be
gone
i
shall
be
dead
but
too
soon
be
gone
i
say
the
very
sight
of
any
of
your
hated
infidel
race
destroys
me
i
wished
to
understand
how
valmont
anger
and
agitations
were
thus
excited
for
she
began
to
utter
strange
assertions
that
my
uncle
intended
to
murder
her
and
that
he
had
made
me
his
instrument
she
groaned
and
wept
one
of
her
attendants
urged
me
to
withdraw
and
i
complied
from
thence
i
visited
the
tomb
again
i
admired
its
structure
and
its
situation
but
i
could
not
devise
why
a
receptacle
for
the
dead
should
be
reared
amidst
the
living
at
this
time
valmont
himself
followed
by
his
steward
and
by
andrew
came
to
inspect
the
tomb
methought
he
looked
pleased
when
he
saw
me
resting
upon
it
he
viewed
it
round
and
round
walked
to
the
foot
of
the
rock
and
contemplated
it
at
that
distance
ross
did
the
same
but
andrew
stood
still
some
yards
on
the
other
side
my
uncle
spoke
thus
at
intervals
doubt
strange
reports
will
circulate
throughout
the
neighbourhood
of
this
monument
vulgar
fools
who
lend
so
ready
a
belief
to
the
ridiculous
tales
of
that
ruin
will
now
have
another
hinge
on
which
to
turn
their
credulity
take
again
the
attitude
i
saw
you
in
when
i
entered
the
wood
there
child
keep
that
posture
a
short
time
your
figure
improves
the
scene
the
monument
excite
much
wonder
ross
does
indeed
sir
the
steward
replied
wonder
at
the
expence
they
wonder
more
at
the
object
and
still
more
than
that
they
wonder
at
the
unconsecrated
ground
my
impiety
is
i
imagine
the
topic
of
the
country
the
steward
remained
silent
remember
my
orders
and
repeat
them
to
your
fellows
i
will
have
no
idle
tales
fabricated
in
the
servant
hall
are
the
opinions
of
other
men
concerning
holy
and
unholy
to
me
it
belongs
to
men
of
rank
to
spurn
the
prejudices
of
the
multitude
shortly
after
my
uncle
addressed
himself
to
me
strange
message
child
has
been
sent
me
from
valmont
which
you
it
seems
have
caused
what
have
you
been
saying
to
her
i
repeated
the
conversation
my
uncle
smiled
in
scorn
folly
said
he
vicinity
of
a
tomb
becomes
a
mortal
disease
it
is
hard
to
judge
whether
the
understanding
or
the
frame
of
such
animals
is
of
the
weaker
texture
child
you
have
killed
your
aunt
by
reminding
her
that
she
may
one
day
happen
to
be
buried
i
was
startled
with
the
phrase
of
had
killed
my
and
i
began
eagerly
to
speak
my
uncle
interrupted
me
with
saying
is
no
real
harm
done
child
these
nervous
affections
are
tremendous
in
representation
but
trifling
in
reality
you
will
however
do
well
to
remember
that
i
do
not
approve
of
your
frequenting
valmont
apartments
my
uncle
then
left
me
not
quite
satisfied
with
myself
nor
with
his
representation
of
valmont
case
yet
on
a
careful
review
of
the
past
i
did
not
feel
that
my
words
my
manner
or
my
information
could
justly
tend
to
produce
uneasiness
either
to
her
or
me
yet
valmont
persists
in
holding
me
culpable
and
has
twice
rejected
the
messages
i
have
sent
by
andrew
still
caroline
i
do
not
understand
why
my
uncle
should
have
expended
money
to
rear
a
marble
tomb
when
any
spot
of
waste
ground
might
serve
for
the
receptacle
of
a
lifeless
body
nor
can
i
understand
how
valmont
is
injured
by
the
knowledge
of
the
circumstance
my
conversation
with
ross
is
for
the
most
part
beyond
my
comprehension
i
observe
too
that
every
part
of
the
family
more
carefully
even
than
before
now
shun
the
wood
last
night
when
nina
and
i
had
held
our
evening
converse
at
the
oak
till
the
moon
shone
at
her
height
andrew
came
in
search
of
me
he
stood
at
an
unusual
distance
and
having
beckoned
me
to
return
he
with
a
soft
quick
step
hastened
before
me
to
the
castle
thus
dearest
caroline
i
pass
from
the
weight
of
a
tedious
uniformity
to
view
and
wonder
at
the
mysterious
actions
of
mysterious
people
oh
speak
to
me
then
my
friend
you
i
can
understand
you
i
love
admire
revere
speak
to
me
often
caroline
bring
the
varieties
of
your
life
before
me
awaken
my
feelings
with
your
and
let
my
judgment
strengthen
in
your
experience
sibella
valmont
letter
vii
from
caroline
ashburn
to
sibella
valmont
my
dearest
sibella
to
all
that
i
yet
know
of
you
i
give
unmixed
praise
your
own
rectitude
your
own
discernment
and
your
reliance
on
my
sincerity
satisfies
you
of
this
truth
and
i
am
assured
that
i
have
your
sanction
when
i
speak
less
of
yourself
than
of
frailer
mortals
on
casting
my
eye
over
the
foregoing
lines
i
smile
to
perceive
that
i
felt
as
if
it
were
necessary
to
apologize
for
the
strong
propensity
i
have
to
begin
this
letter
as
i
concluded
my
last
namely
with
murden
whom
in
the
moments
of
my
best
opinion
i
can
not
wholly
admire
nor
at
the
worst
of
times
can
i
altogether
condemn
as
he
is
then
or
as
i
think
he
is
take
him
colonel
ridson
you
know
said
murden
was
handsome
so
say
i
at
times
divinely
handsome
but
only
at
times
his
figure
it
is
true
never
loses
its
symmetry
and
grace
but
his
features
strongly
influenced
by
their
governing
power
the
mind
vary
from
beauty
to
deformity
that
is
deformity
of
expression
what
would
lady
mary
lady
laura
or
the
two
miss
winderhams
who
are
lately
added
to
our
party
say
to
hear
me
connect
the
ideas
of
murden
and
deformity
yet
in
their
hearing
incurring
the
terrible
certainty
of
being
arraigned
in
their
judgments
for
want
of
taste
of
being
charged
with
prudery
affectation
and
i
know
not
what
besides
i
shall
dare
repeat
that
i
have
looked
on
murden
and
looked
from
him
again
because
he
appeared
deformed
and
disgusting
the
libertine
is
ever
deformed
the
flatterer
is
ever
disgusting
his
daily
practice
in
this
house
justifies
me
in
bestowing
on
him
the
latter
epithet
i
own
and
i
rejoice
to
own
that
of
the
justice
of
the
former
i
have
my
doubts
vain
he
is
that
he
is
gratified
by
encourages
even
stimulates
the
attention
of
fools
and
coquettes
i
can
not
deny
and
when
i
view
him
indulging
a
weakness
so
contemptible
so
dangerous
i
am
almost
ready
to
believe
he
may
be
any
thing
that
is
vicious
and
that
having
taken
vanity
and
flattery
for
his
guides
he
may
attain
to
the
horrid
perfection
of
a
successful
debauchee
yet
what
man
plunged
in
the
whirlpool
of
debauchery
ever
retained
delicacy
of
sentiment
and
pungency
of
feeling
i
think
murden
possesses
both
what
man
of
debased
inclinations
would
preserve
that
perpetual
delicacy
that
happy
medium
between
neglect
and
encouragement
by
which
murden
regulates
his
conduct
to
lady
laura
bowden
lady
laura
celebrated
as
a
wit
and
beauty
betrays
to
every
observer
her
passion
for
murden
i
dreaded
on
such
an
occasion
to
see
a
vain
young
man
insolent
in
pity
or
barbarous
in
neglect
but
lady
laura
has
not
a
particle
more
or
less
of
his
admiration
his
flattery
and
his
services
than
any
other
lady
of
the
circle
ah
i
feel
already
that
my
description
languishes
the
murden
before
me
is
a
being
of
more
vigour
and
more
interest
than
the
murden
on
my
paper
i
have
failed
in
discriminating
the
contradictory
parts
of
his
character
and
i
give
up
description
leaving
those
circumstances
i
may
on
further
acquaintance
select
from
the
round
of
his
actions
to
speak
for
him
these
insatiable
devourers
of
amusement
tear
me
from
my
pen
the
morning
which
in
my
mother
house
in
town
i
possessed
uncontrouled
is
no
longer
my
own
the
days
are
wasted
in
the
execution
of
projects
that
promise
much
and
perform
nothing
and
i
made
a
whimsical
attempt
the
other
day
to
convince
my
good
friends
here
that
we
ought
at
least
to
be
rational
one
half
of
one
time
if
we
would
find
any
pleasure
in
being
foolish
the
other
half
but
while
i
am
complaining
to
you
sibella
the
party
are
perhaps
complaining
of
me
adieu
for
a
short
time
i
go
to
taste
not
the
simplicity
of
a
golden
age
but
the
simplicity
of
gold
and
tinsel
on
the
banks
of
a
charming
piece
of
water
we
fish
under
a
silken
awning
horns
clarionets
and
bassoons
are
stationed
in
a
neighbouring
grove
with
their
sweet
concords
occasionally
to
soothe
our
fatigues
ices
the
choicest
fruits
and
other
delicate
preparations
for
the
refreshment
of
the
palate
are
at
hand
and
notwithstanding
all
this
costly
care
it
is
very
possible
we
shall
pass
a
listless
morning
return
without
any
increase
of
appetite
or
animal
spirits
and
be
mighty
ready
to
bestow
loud
commendations
on
the
pleasures
of
a
morning
from
which
we
derive
no
other
secret
satisfaction
than
the
certainty
of
its
being
at
an
end
a
summons
the
carriages
are
at
the
door
you
understand
i
hope
that
this
is
a
expedition
therefore
a
coach
and
a
chariot
attends
murden
drives
one
phaeton
colonel
ridson
another
and
ashburn
who
has
arisen
from
the
voluptuous
luxury
of
the
palanquin
and
eight
slaves
to
the
more
active
triumph
of
a
high
seat
reins
and
long
whip
will
drive
lady
laura
bowden
in
her
curricle
it
would
be
vain
for
me
to
attempt
to
sleep
for
i
endure
at
present
a
very
considerable
portion
though
from
a
different
cause
of
those
restless
feelings
which
so
often
my
sibella
urge
you
from
your
bed
i
believe
i
shall
not
go
to
bed
this
night
yet
i
have
not
to
tell
you
that
i
am
roused
to
this
wakefulness
by
events
strikingly
removed
from
the
ordinary
course
of
our
lives
on
the
contrary
the
accidents
of
the
day
though
new
in
their
form
are
by
no
means
of
an
uncommon
character
it
is
alas
no
novelty
for
some
people
to
be
inconsistent
and
for
others
to
imagine
that
rank
and
riches
as
it
places
them
beyond
the
reach
of
the
common
misfortunes
of
life
gives
them
full
privilege
to
censure
the
weak
and
contemn
the
unfortunate
i
hope
benevolence
is
not
a
novelty
i
would
not
subtract
from
the
due
praise
of
any
individual
but
i
feel
it
as
it
were
a
tacit
reproach
upon
human
nature
or
rather
upon
human
manners
when
we
loudly
vaunt
the
benevolent
actions
of
any
single
man
i
love
the
man
be
he
whom
he
may
who
will
perform
the
offices
of
a
brother
to
the
weakest
the
most
despised
of
his
fellow
creatures
but
i
lament
that
the
example
should
be
so
unusual
and
when
seen
rather
vaunted
than
valued
and
speedily
forgotten
i
have
no
reason
to
accuse
myself
of
a
want
of
penetration
our
morning
was
any
thing
but
pleasant
the
air
from
the
water
chilled
sir
thomas
lady
barlowe
could
find
no
scope
amidst
the
very
small
talk
for
one
single
repartee
the
earl
of
ulson
had
the
the
countess
detests
the
music
of
wind
instruments
and
my
mother
found
out
that
she
hated
fishing
the
young
ladies
lost
their
spirits
and
temper
by
losing
murden
whose
absence
occurred
in
such
a
way
as
put
me
out
of
temper
and
out
of
spirits
also
as
we
were
on
the
road
to
the
destined
spot
of
diversion
a
pretty
country
girl
on
a
horse
loaded
with
paniers
drew
up
to
the
while
the
cavalcade
passed
her
i
was
in
murden
phaeton
and
we
were
the
last
carriage
but
one
the
girl
in
making
her
awkward
obeisance
to
the
company
no
sooner
lifted
her
eyes
to
murden
than
she
blushed
deeper
than
scarlet
it
was
a
blush
of
such
deep
shame
of
such
anguish
that
i
felt
a
sudden
pain
like
a
shock
of
electricity
the
time
of
passing
was
so
instantaneous
that
i
could
not
see
what
effect
the
blush
had
at
the
moment
on
murden
countenance
but
when
i
did
look
on
him
i
found
him
lost
in
thought
from
which
he
presently
started
to
gaze
back
upon
the
girl
while
she
continued
in
sight
it
was
palpably
obvious
that
in
this
incident
murden
had
a
concern
more
powerful
than
any
interest
he
took
in
the
party
for
he
remained
dispirited
and
absent
and
after
refusing
to
angle
and
walking
a
few
turns
to
and
fro
on
the
banks
of
the
water
he
said
he
should
join
us
again
before
we
returned
to
dinner
mounted
his
servant
horse
and
disappeared
thus
were
we
left
without
one
satisfied
person
of
the
party
except
the
colonel
ridson
and
the
lord
bowden
we
saw
no
more
of
murden
till
late
in
the
afternoon
i
must
now
my
dear
sibella
call
your
attention
to
the
history
of
an
unfortunate
woman
who
in
occupying
the
greatest
part
of
this
afternoon
gave
scope
to
the
display
of
that
and
that
benevolence
to
which
i
alluded
in
a
former
passage
of
this
letter
when
sir
thomas
barlowe
left
the
east
indies
he
retained
in
his
service
a
young
creole
as
secretary
at
that
time
the
youth
who
was
sanguine
enough
and
young
enough
to
believe
that
his
situation
would
increase
in
gain
and
be
permanent
in
favour
wrote
to
his
mother
whom
he
contributed
to
support
saying
it
was
his
wish
she
should
come
to
england
he
expected
she
would
wait
for
a
remittance
from
him
to
pay
her
passage
but
the
mother
impatient
to
join
her
only
child
sold
her
little
property
borrowed
on
her
son
credit
the
remainder
of
the
money
for
her
passage
and
set
sail
from
bengal
much
about
the
time
that
her
son
with
whom
the
climate
had
disagreed
and
whom
sir
thomas
had
discharged
set
sail
from
england
arrived
in
london
she
hastens
to
sir
thomas
barlowe
house
to
meet
this
beloved
son
the
family
are
in
the
country
the
porter
surlily
assures
her
that
her
son
is
gone
she
will
not
believe
him
demands
the
name
of
sir
thomas
barlowe
country
seat
returns
to
her
lodging
with
trembling
limbs
and
an
aching
heart
writes
a
letter
to
barlowe
hall
which
probably
was
never
sent
and
falls
ill
of
an
ague
and
fever
eight
weeks
the
unhappy
woman
languished
in
the
extreme
of
misery
and
disease
receiving
no
tidings
from
her
son
having
no
friend
no
acquaintance
either
to
pity
or
relieve
her
her
money
all
spent
her
clothes
almost
all
sold
she
availed
herself
of
a
small
recruit
of
strength
and
begged
her
way
half
naked
to
sir
thomas
barlowe
seat
kept
alive
no
doubt
by
the
feeble
hope
that
she
should
yet
find
her
son
at
barlowe
hall
the
tidings
of
her
son
departure
was
confirmed
despair
gave
her
strength
in
spite
of
the
servants
opposition
she
forced
her
way
into
the
dining
parlour
ere
the
dessert
was
yet
removed
she
designed
to
have
thrown
herself
at
the
feet
of
sir
thomas
but
on
whom
did
her
eye
first
fix
on
no
other
than
ashburn
whom
in
her
own
land
in
her
happiest
days
she
had
served
in
the
capacity
of
housekeeper
had
the
apartment
held
the
first
potentates
of
the
earth
i
firmly
believe
they
would
have
been
as
so
many
straws
in
the
poor
woman
way
when
she
rushed
forward
to
ashburn
she
clasped
her
knees
kissed
her
hands
her
gown
the
very
chair
on
which
she
sat
and
was
so
wild
and
extravagant
in
her
joy
that
i
do
not
wonder
at
the
result
i
only
wonder
that
her
intellects
survived
it
was
in
vain
the
company
expressed
their
disgust
at
so
miserable
an
object
in
vain
my
mother
and
sir
thomas
commanded
her
to
rise
and
withdraw
she
would
in
her
imperfect
language
curse
the
climate
of
britain
she
would
intreat
them
to
send
her
back
to
her
own
country
she
would
relate
the
history
of
her
griefs
till
combined
recollections
or
perhaps
the
frigid
countenances
of
those
around
her
wrought
a
passionate
flood
of
tears
and
she
then
quietly
suffered
the
footman
to
conduct
her
from
the
room
the
rigid
countess
of
ulson
instantly
began
a
severe
investigation
of
the
folly
of
the
young
indian
who
sent
so
far
for
his
mother
while
his
own
prosperity
was
yet
wavering
and
uncertain
lady
barlowe
and
the
young
ladies
appeared
disconcerted
the
earl
of
ulson
had
dined
in
his
own
chamber
colonel
ridson
often
shifted
his
seat
ashburn
and
sir
thomas
barlowe
gave
their
assent
to
the
invective
of
lady
ulson
adding
at
the
same
time
all
the
shades
of
imprudence
in
the
enterprise
they
agreed
however
in
the
necessity
of
affording
her
some
relief
two
guineas
from
sir
thomas
and
two
from
ashburn
was
the
sum
contributed
and
with
this
four
guineas
the
servant
was
ordered
to
deliver
the
following
commands
that
she
should
immediately
go
back
to
london
where
she
might
easily
find
employment
for
her
support
till
her
son
should
know
she
was
in
england
and
remit
money
for
her
return
to
india
colonel
ridson
stole
to
the
door
after
the
servant
and
gave
into
his
hand
a
benefaction
for
the
widow
i
had
only
waited
the
conclusion
of
the
nabob
and
my
determination
and
i
now
left
them
the
indian
did
not
as
before
attempt
to
rush
into
the
parlour
but
in
the
hall
she
wrung
her
hands
gnashed
her
teeth
tore
her
hair
exclaiming
she
must
go
back
she
could
not
work
she
could
not
live
in
a
climate
that
would
kill
a
dog
my
remonstrances
she
could
not
hear
i
might
as
well
have
spoken
to
the
dead
it
was
then
that
murden
returned
home
astonished
at
the
frantic
agonies
of
the
poor
distressed
woman
he
enquired
the
cause
from
the
servants
whom
pity
had
drawn
around
her
he
threw
his
whip
out
of
his
hand
and
coming
up
to
the
indian
yes
sibella
this
perhaps
this
very
elegant
fashionable
handsome
and
admired
murden
immediately
lifted
in
his
arms
the
poor
miserable
despised
object
from
whose
touch
others
had
revolted
carried
her
into
an
apartment
and
seated
her
by
himself
on
a
sopha
still
holding
his
arm
round
her
to
prevent
her
relapsing
into
those
violent
excesses
shall
go
back
cried
murden
swear
by
the
god
that
made
me
you
shall
go
back
this
very
hour
if
you
will
but
be
calm
she
looked
on
him
steadily
it
was
such
a
look
sibella
said
murden
ashburn
says
you
shall
go
back
you
know
miss
ashburn
ay
and
you
love
her
too
i
know
you
do
in
a
fainting
voice
she
said
i
shall
die
with
my
poor
joseph
at
last
her
head
fell
upon
murden
breast
and
he
suffered
it
to
remain
there
till
he
found
she
had
become
insensible
he
then
requested
the
housekeeper
to
see
a
bed
prepared
for
her
and
by
his
kind
speeches
and
charming
tones
he
rendered
every
servant
as
eager
to
do
the
poor
woman
service
as
he
himself
had
been
all
this
time
i
forgot
the
country
girl
while
i
attended
the
indian
to
her
bed
murden
visited
the
drawing
room
and
when
i
also
went
thither
i
found
murden
face
in
a
glow
he
was
debating
with
his
uncle
on
the
danger
that
might
befal
his
sick
patient
by
removing
her
from
barlowe
hall
to
the
next
village
and
the
danger
sir
thomas
might
incur
by
allowing
her
to
remain
where
she
was
the
nabob
recollected
she
had
spoken
of
her
fever
in
london
and
already
he
saw
himself
in
the
utmost
danger
and
half
his
family
dead
or
dying
of
the
mortal
disease
any
sum
of
money
any
thing
in
his
house
that
could
tend
to
her
accommodation
she
might
have
so
that
she
was
but
removed
he
absolutely
shook
with
apprehension
and
murden
was
at
length
compelled
to
yield
the
point
a
post
chaise
was
accordingly
got
ready
two
maids
went
in
it
with
her
to
support
her
for
successive
faintings
had
reduced
her
to
the
weakness
of
an
infant
murden
although
it
was
a
rainy
evening
walked
by
the
side
of
the
chaise
to
the
village
to
see
that
she
was
there
taken
proper
care
of
in
the
drawing
room
the
interval
between
this
arrangement
and
the
time
of
murden
return
from
the
village
was
passed
in
a
most
irksome
state
the
weather
would
not
allow
of
walking
or
riding
no
casual
visitors
arrived
every
common
topic
of
conversation
languished
and
each
individual
dreaded
lest
some
other
of
the
party
should
begin
to
speak
of
the
indian
whom
they
were
one
and
all
laboriously
urgent
to
forget
the
entrance
of
tea
and
coffee
was
an
immense
relief
their
cups
were
received
with
unusual
complacency
and
their
drooping
spirits
revived
the
were
just
arranged
when
murden
entered
good
god
what
a
charm
was
diffused
over
his
countenance
he
was
pale
with
fatigue
and
want
of
food
his
linen
soiled
and
his
hair
disordered
with
the
wind
and
rain
but
there
was
such
a
sweetness
in
his
eyes
that
no
heart
could
resist
it
every
one
pronounced
his
name
at
once
murden
breathed
lady
laura
in
the
melting
voice
of
love
then
covered
with
confusion
she
added
murden
you
will
kill
yourself
at
the
same
time
she
made
an
involuntary
motion
for
him
to
seat
himself
between
her
and
her
sister
he
did
so
his
heart
was
open
to
the
reception
of
all
tenderness
he
could
not
reject
lady
tone
he
took
her
hand
i
saw
him
press
it
he
said
something
low
and
soft
and
her
cheeks
were
instantly
suffused
with
a
burning
colour
that
country
girl
thought
i
could
not
help
sighing
for
her
i
sighed
too
for
murden
said
i
to
myself
he
could
suffer
me
to
possess
his
confidence
would
suffer
me
to
advise
exhort
and
intreat
him
to
be
worthy
of
himself
perhaps
while
these
and
other
such
reflections
occupied
my
mind
my
eyes
were
fixed
upon
murden
for
suddenly
i
perceived
that
his
cheek
took
a
stronger
glow
than
even
lady
laura
and
he
sprang
up
from
his
seat
bring
me
some
biscuits
and
a
jelly
said
he
carelessly
i
believe
i
have
not
dined
this
was
enough
to
rouse
sir
thomas
now
cried
the
nabob
ever
any
thing
like
it
you
have
had
no
dinner
and
here
you
are
all
this
time
in
wet
clothes
lord
have
mercy
upon
me
call
your
valet
and
he
began
to
ring
the
bell
furiously
am
sure
arthur
you
will
be
you
will
have
a
fever
you
will
certainly
kill
yourself
as
lady
laura
says
i
had
too
much
compassion
to
look
at
lady
laura
and
so
had
murden
for
he
crossed
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
immediately
withdrew
as
murden
shut
one
door
a
servant
opened
another
and
gave
into
my
hands
your
last
dear
letter
i
retired
to
my
own
chamber
to
read
it
you
are
a
glorious
girl
sibella
you
elevate
you
excite
me
you
awaken
my
mind
to
more
and
more
love
of
those
fervid
qualities
that
shine
so
eminent
in
you
had
your
bonneville
lived
well
fear
not
my
love
the
day
of
your
liberty
will
come
there
are
perhaps
other
bonnevilles
in
the
world
who
will
like
him
delight
to
give
you
that
instruction
for
which
your
mind
pants
already
you
possess
energy
fortitude
and
feeling
and
those
qualities
now
kept
alive
and
fostered
by
your
love
may
one
day
be
called
into
action
by
objects
of
higher
magnitude
of
far
higher
value
forgive
me
than
love
though
it
were
the
love
of
a
sibella
i
stood
at
my
window
to
read
your
letter
the
rain
and
wind
had
ceased
there
was
not
even
breeze
enough
to
shake
away
the
drops
that
yet
rested
upon
the
leaves
the
dim
grey
melancholy
remains
of
day
just
afforded
sufficient
light
to
read
by
and
when
i
had
finished
your
letter
i
threw
up
the
sash
and
leaned
out
thinking
of
you
my
sibella
in
my
imagination
seeing
you
seeing
your
fawn
your
wood
your
oak
your
black
angry
looking
rock
your
solemn
ruin
your
clumps
of
yew
trees
your
white
marble
tomb
and
these
objects
engrossed
my
whole
attention
while
those
which
surrounded
me
became
hid
in
darkness
footsteps
passed
underneath
my
window
through
a
path
leading
to
the
stables
one
voice
said
and
many
a
hard
day
work
have
my
poor
dame
and
i
done
since
and
have
gone
to
bed
to
cry
and
moan
all
night
for
naughtiness
we
were
ashamed
to
show
our
faces
in
our
own
parish
but
your
honour
assures
me
you
wo
forget
her
another
voice
answered
that
i
have
promised
i
will
perform
depend
on
it
the
latter
voice
was
murden
now
i
felt
the
chill
air
of
evening
and
i
shut
down
my
window
you
have
candles
brought
asked
agnes
entering
my
chamber
think
continued
she
that
good
murden
is
not
going
to
send
one
of
the
grooms
eight
miles
for
a
physician
to
come
to
the
poor
indian
because
the
laundry
maid
who
is
just
returned
from
her
told
him
she
is
not
any
better
i
believe
there
never
was
such
a
young
gentleman
you
know
where
he
is
now
said
i
to
the
stables
to
hurry
away
the
groom
any
one
with
him
an
old
farmer
who
has
been
in
his
dressing
room
while
he
dined
i
dare
say
murden
has
been
doing
some
good
thing
or
other
for
him
too
hope
he
has
replied
i
that
i
have
promised
i
will
perform
depend
on
i
repeated
to
myself
me
down
stairs
agnes
said
i
hope
indeed
murden
has
done
him
some
kindness
agnes
looked
at
me
attentively
and
did
not
reply
to
me
i
returned
to
the
drawing
room
divested
of
that
pleasurable
glow
of
feeling
which
i
enjoyed
before
the
voices
spoke
underneath
my
window
as
i
entered
the
room
lord
ulson
was
saying
to
my
mother
a
reference
as
you
propose
madam
would
be
unpardonable
from
me
nor
can
we
possibly
expect
the
lady
will
be
sincere
i
was
surprised
to
understand
from
the
earl
bow
that
i
was
the
subject
of
their
conversation
and
i
requested
that
if
his
lordship
meant
me
he
would
hereafter
never
expect
to
find
me
insincere
and
i
begged
to
know
i
had
merited
the
accusation
ashburn
and
the
earl
mutually
explained
his
lordship
was
persuaded
it
seems
that
a
letter
exciting
such
visible
pleasure
as
that
did
which
the
servant
delivered
to
me
must
be
from
a
favoured
lover
my
mother
was
certain
the
effect
was
produced
by
my
to
use
her
own
expression
and
as
the
earl
was
incredulous
she
was
desirous
of
referring
the
decision
to
me
lady
laura
affectedly
begged
i
would
defend
the
of
friendship
and
my
mother
sneeringly
observed
that
i
had
a
fine
scope
for
my
talents
in
the
present
instance
i
took
your
letter
from
my
pocket
i
unfolded
and
spread
it
open
in
my
lap
is
the
letter
said
i
pretty
hand
said
colonel
ridson
it
is
not
a
female
character
miss
ashburn
the
earl
said
i
asked
if
i
should
read
it
the
earl
professed
to
admire
my
condescension
but
my
mother
yawned
i
selected
two
passages
from
your
letter
and
read
them
lord
ulson
who
had
only
chosen
this
subject
for
want
of
something
to
do
was
now
perfectly
satisfied
and
convinced
for
sir
thomas
had
invited
him
to
piquet
the
colonel
thought
your
stile
very
charming
lady
barlowe
thought
it
very
dull
and
as
no
one
contradicted
her
opinion
the
subject
would
here
have
ended
had
i
not
as
i
put
the
letter
again
into
my
pocket
told
my
mother
that
her
friend
valmont
had
lately
been
a
poor
inanimate
vapoured
being
ashburn
called
her
friend
dying
she
said
of
diseases
whose
slightest
symptom
had
never
reached
her
a
burden
to
herself
and
a
torment
to
every
one
else
nevertheless
her
fate
to
be
pitied
lamented
and
deplored
without
bounds
then
it
became
your
uncle
turn
and
his
sum
of
enormities
was
divided
and
subdivided
into
multitudes
of
sins
so
that
i
was
ready
to
ask
myself
if
i
had
really
ever
known
this
valmont
no
one
spark
of
pity
remained
for
him
no
he
was
neither
pitied
by
ashburn
nor
prayed
for
by
the
countess
of
ulson
when
my
mother
had
exhausted
her
topic
i
said
to
her
pictures
are
vivid
madam
suppose
you
finish
the
family
miss
valmont
what
say
you
of
her
leave
her
to
you
replied
ashburn
only
think
her
a
little
handsome
a
little
proud
a
little
ignorant
and
half
insane
you
can
tell
the
rest
do
miss
ashburn
cried
lady
mary
bowden
dearly
love
to
hear
of
queer
creatures
am
to
add
said
i
that
remains
of
a
already
declared
to
be
proud
ignorant
and
half
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
i
will
this
the
door
opened
and
in
came
murden
and
the
poor
indian
the
country
girl
and
the
old
farmer
who
had
wept
sleepless
nights
for
together
rushed
upon
my
imagination
again
lady
laura
made
room
for
murden
and
again
he
took
his
seat
on
the
same
sopha
i
said
to
myself
as
i
looked
at
him
where
are
the
signs
of
remorse
there
are
none
not
even
the
softened
eye
of
virtuous
resolutions
strange
that
i
read
of
nothing
in
that
face
but
inward
peace
and
freedom
go
on
miss
ashburn
cried
lady
mary
i
did
sibella
i
began
once
more
to
speak
of
you
and
in
a
little
time
i
called
back
a
part
at
least
of
the
vigour
and
warmth
which
murden
entrance
and
a
train
of
fugitive
thought
had
chased
from
me
i
began
with
your
beauty
i
omitted
nothing
which
i
could
devise
to
make
the
picture
worthy
of
the
original
i
spoke
of
the
first
sight
i
had
of
you
the
impressive
effect
at
that
moment
of
your
face
your
form
your
attitude
your
simple
attire
i
appealed
to
my
mother
to
testify
the
singular
beauty
of
your
eyes
your
forehead
your
mouth
your
hair
i
told
them
that
your
hair
had
never
been
distorted
by
fashion
that
parted
from
the
top
of
the
head
and
always
uncovered
it
fell
around
your
shoulder
displaying
at
once
its
profusion
and
its
colour
and
ornamenting
as
well
by
its
shade
as
its
contrast
one
of
the
finest
necks
that
ever
belonged
to
a
human
figure
lady
laura
now
grew
restless
in
her
seat
for
murden
listened
he
had
even
dropped
a
shuttle
he
had
taken
out
of
lady
laura
hand
and
either
inattentively
or
quite
unconsciously
had
allowed
her
ladyship
to
stoop
to
the
ground
for
it
herself
still
he
listened
adorned
by
nature
said
i
what
way
shall
i
further
recommend
her
art
has
disclaimed
her
this
lady
mary
never
out
of
her
uncle
castle
since
she
was
six
years
old
has
been
left
utterly
without
the
skill
of
the
governess
and
waiting
maid
an
old
tutor
indeed
gave
her
some
singular
lessons
on
the
value
of
sincerity
independence
courage
and
capacity
and
she
a
worthy
scholar
of
such
a
teacher
as
indeed
you
may
judge
from
the
specimen
i
read
of
her
letter
has
odd
notions
and
practices
and
half
insane
as
ashburn
says
would
rather
think
herself
born
to
navigate
ships
and
build
edifices
than
to
come
into
a
world
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
twist
her
hair
into
ringlets
learn
to
be
feeble
and
to
find
her
feet
too
hallowed
to
tread
on
the
ground
beneath
her
cries
murden
bending
eagerly
forward
me
miss
ashburn
of
whom
you
speak
a
miss
valmont
said
lady
laura
peevishly
valmont
rejoined
murden
ashburn
do
you
really
speak
of
miss
valmont
really
do
mr
murden
he
did
not
reply
again
but
folding
his
arms
he
leaned
thoughtfully
on
the
back
of
the
sopha
lady
laura
now
quite
out
of
temper
began
to
complain
that
he
was
an
encumbrance
and
forgetting
to
offer
the
least
apology
he
instantly
sprang
up
and
took
a
distant
chair
i
should
tell
you
that
by
this
time
my
mother
sir
thomas
the
earl
and
the
colonel
were
at
cards
so
that
i
had
only
lady
barlowe
and
the
younger
part
of
the
company
for
my
auditors
how
asked
lady
mary
does
this
odd
young
lady
i
must
not
again
say
queer
creature
employ
her
time
with
cats
and
dogs
and
chattering
with
servants
i
suppose
said
lady
barlowe
lady
barlowe
i
replied
resources
of
her
mind
and
to
use
her
own
description
furnish
better
expedients
she
wishes
for
communication
for
intercourse
for
society
but
she
is
too
sincere
to
purchase
any
pleasure
by
artifice
and
concealment
she
is
too
proud
to
tempt
the
servants
from
their
duty
all
of
whom
except
two
are
forbidden
to
approach
her
a
unpolished
footman
brings
her
breakfast
and
supper
to
her
apartment
if
she
is
there
it
is
well
if
not
he
leaves
it
be
the
time
longer
or
shorter
till
she
does
come
her
female
domestic
deaf
and
deformed
would
attend
if
summoned
but
miss
valmont
finds
her
dress
simple
enough
and
her
limbs
robust
enough
to
enable
her
to
perform
all
the
functions
of
her
toilet
a
true
child
of
nature
bold
in
innocence
day
or
night
is
equally
propitious
to
her
rambles
and
always
mentally
alive
she
has
the
glow
of
animation
on
her
cheeks
the
fire
of
vivacity
in
her
eye
alone
in
a
solitary
wood
at
or
at
midnight
midnight
lady
laura
exclaimed
you
did
not
go
alone
into
the
woods
at
midnight
i
removed
the
idea
her
ladyship
and
others
perhaps
had
of
its
impropriety
by
informing
them
your
wood
was
of
small
extent
not
distant
from
the
castle
and
inclosed
within
the
moat
which
by
means
of
a
canal
had
been
carried
round
the
park
as
well
as
castle
human
foot
said
i
those
admitted
over
the
can
enter
this
wood
which
though
small
is
romantic
and
though
gloomy
has
its
beauties
it
rises
on
the
side
of
the
canal
and
terminates
at
the
foot
of
a
rock
it
contains
a
tomb
on
one
part
of
the
rock
are
spread
the
tottering
ruins
of
a
small
chapel
and
hermitage
and
these
objects
serve
to
invite
miss
valmont
to
her
wood
while
they
check
the
approach
of
diseased
imaginations
i
spoke
further
sibella
of
your
favourite
lonely
haunt
the
flying
speed
with
which
i
have
seen
you
bound
there
the
affectionate
caresses
of
your
little
fawn
and
numberless
other
circumstances
lady
laura
was
resolved
neither
to
be
amused
by
the
novelty
nor
seduced
by
the
merit
i
had
attributed
to
you
she
found
you
more
whimsical
than
pleasing
more
daring
than
delicate
she
wished
you
all
manner
of
good
things
and
among
the
rest
that
you
might
not
at
last
fall
in
love
with
one
of
your
uncle
footmen
i
smiled
and
replied
to
her
ladyship
that
your
uncle
wisdom
and
foresight
had
provided
against
that
misfortune
you
already
had
a
lover
worthy
of
you
god
are
you
acquainted
with
clement
montgomery
it
was
murden
from
whom
this
exclamation
burst
and
i
looked
at
him
without
power
to
reply
it
almost
appeared
miraculous
to
hear
any
one
in
that
room
name
clement
montgomery
that
the
montgomery
lady
barlowe
asked
went
abroad
with
murden
madam
said
i
know
clement
montgomery
intimately
he
replied
that
he
did
could
you
be
so
cruel
said
i
did
you
not
interrupt
me
long
since
you
who
know
miss
valmont
lover
must
know
miss
valmont
also
why
did
you
not
take
the
voice
of
that
lover
and
paint
as
you
must
have
heard
him
paint
her
attractive
graces
her
noble
qualities
oh
it
was
barbarous
to
leave
that
to
be
done
by
monotonous
friendship
to
which
the
spirit
of
love
could
alone
do
justice
methinks
his
answer
was
a
very
strange
one
so
cold
so
abrupt
i
felt
displeased
at
the
moment
and
checked
myself
in
some
eager
question
i
was
about
to
ask
respecting
clement
montgomery
murden
reply
sibella
was
that
i
had
done
enough
and
he
withdrew
too
immediately
withdrew
as
if
weary
of
me
and
my
subject
at
supper
his
place
at
table
was
vacant
his
valet
alledged
he
was
writing
letters
sir
thomas
would
be
positive
he
was
ill
we
heard
of
nothing
but
and
it
is
highly
probable
the
house
would
have
been
presently
half
filled
with
physicians
and
sir
thomas
really
in
need
of
them
if
murden
had
not
come
smiling
and
languishing
into
the
supper
room
this
time
i
had
the
honour
of
his
choosing
his
seat
next
me
and
as
i
saw
that
he
only
pretended
to
eat
in
order
to
appease
his
uncle
i
told
him
in
a
low
voice
i
believed
he
was
mind
is
my
disease
he
said
ah
then
thought
i
he
does
perhaps
repent
i
longed
to
talk
to
him
but
i
could
think
of
no
subject
no
name
but
and
peggy
i
had
not
courage
to
mention
i
made
an
awkward
remark
upon
our
ride
to
the
water
side
then
i
introduced
as
awkwardly
and
to
as
little
purpose
the
time
of
my
leaning
out
of
my
chamber
window
murden
unconscious
of
my
meaning
and
allusions
heard
me
composedly
and
i
ended
only
where
i
began
he
found
me
absent
and
embarrassed
and
though
little
suspecting
that
mind
also
his
attentions
were
more
exclusively
mine
than
i
had
ever
before
experienced
them
to
have
been
a
few
minutes
before
the
company
separated
murden
said
to
me
am
informed
miss
ashburn
that
you
intend
visiting
our
poor
indian
morning
i
said
had
ordered
my
horse
early
for
that
purpose
should
request
your
permission
to
attend
you
madam
but
i
am
in
some
sort
engaged
to
eat
my
breakfast
on
brown
bread
and
new
milk
at
a
said
i
madam
rejoined
murden
as
calmly
as
though
he
had
carried
content
and
joy
into
that
instead
of
remorse
and
misery
madam
the
most
charming
spot
in
this
country
my
constant
house
of
call
in
the
shooting
season
many
pleasant
brown
bread
breakfasts
and
suppers
have
i
eaten
there
so
unblushing
so
a
confession
absolutely
startled
me
i
had
already
risen
to
retire
he
rose
also
and
said
you
miss
ashburn
allow
me
to
ride
with
you
in
the
morning
neglect
the
mr
murden
he
replied
time
is
of
little
consequence
i
can
go
there
afterward
but
it
is
said
i
of
infinite
consequence
not
for
the
world
would
i
be
the
means
of
your
dispensing
with
one
title
of
your
promises
to
that
pray
said
i
turning
back
after
having
bade
him
good
night
murden
do
you
correspond
with
clement
montgomery
again
i
became
reconciled
to
him
again
i
was
persuaded
that
he
repented
of
his
error
and
that
he
is
not
hardened
in
his
transgressions
for
he
understood
the
fullest
tendency
of
my
question
his
countenance
instantly
expressed
shame
surprise
and
sorrow
too
and
his
voice
faultered
while
he
said
miss
ashburn
why
should
you
wish
to
know
that
and
when
he
added
do
indeed
madam
correspond
with
montgomery
he
looked
from
me
my
was
more
cordial
than
the
former
one
and
i
hope
that
if
murden
finds
his
breakfast
at
the
less
pleasant
than
heretofore
its
usefulness
will
increase
as
its
pleasure
ceases
bursts
into
my
chamber
in
another
hour
i
shall
prepare
to
visit
the
indian

letter
viii
from
clement
montgomery
to
arthur
murden
infidel
as
thou
art
toward
beauty
and
indolent
as
thou
art
in
friendship
whence
dost
thou
still
derive
the
power
to
attract
the
homage
of
beauty
and
the
zeal
of
friendship
that
janetta
the
empress
of
all
hearts
but
callous
thine
possessed
sensibility
susceptibility
or
even
animation
thou
infidel
arthur
didst
deny
yet
janetta
can
sometimes
torture
her
admiring
clement
by
the
repetition
of
thy
praises
four
letters
of
mine
long
letters
letters
to
which
i
yielded
hours
that
might
have
been
rapturous
in
enjoyments
those
letters
lie
the
last
as
the
first
unanswered
unheeded
in
thy
possession
i
devoutly
thank
the
star
that
shed
its
influence
over
the
hour
of
my
birth
that
it
gave
me
a
temperament
opposite
to
thine
arthur
for
have
i
not
seen
thee
more
than
insensible
even
averse
to
the
offered
favours
of
the
fair
have
i
not
seen
thee
yawn
with
listlessness
at
an
assembly
where
rank
and
splendor
the
delights
of
harmony
and
the
fascinations
of
beauty
filled
my
every
sense
with
exstacy
give
me
the
sphere
of
fashion
and
its
delights
fix
me
in
the
regions
of
ever
varying
novelty
mine
is
life
i
sail
on
an
ocean
of
pleasure
where
are
its
rocks
its
sands
its
secret
whirlpools
or
its
daring
tempests
fables
all
fables
invented
by
the
envious
impotence
of
snarling
cynics
to
crush
the
aspiring
fancy
of
glowing
youth
thy
apathy
murden
i
detest
nay
i
pity
thee
and
i
swear
by
that
pity
i
would
sacrifice
some
portion
of
my
pleasures
to
awaken
thee
to
the
knowledge
of
one
hour
rapture
arthur
how
couldst
thou
slight
the
accomplished
l
how
could
thou
acknowledge
that
she
was
beautiful
yet
tell
me
of
her
defects
defects
good
heaven
defects
in
a
beautiful
kind
and
yielding
woman
arthur
arthur
in
compassion
to
thy
passing
youth
thy
graceful
figure
and
all
those
manly
charms
with
which
thou
art
formed
to
captivate
forget
thy
wild
chimeras
thy
absurd
dreams
of
romantic
useless
perfections
and
make
it
thy
future
creed
that
in
woman
there
can
be
no
crime
but
ugliness
no
weakness
nor
defect
but
cruelty
every
day
every
hour
janetta
brings
me
new
proof
that
thy
judgment
is
worthless
she
has
tenderness
she
has
sensibility
she
does
not
as
thou
didst
assert
receive
my
love
merely
to
enrich
herself
with
its
offerings
and
constancy
she
has
even
more
boundless
than
i
except
for
a
time
could
desire
for
she
talks
of
being
mine
for
ever
and
says
wherever
i
go
thither
will
she
go
also
and
i
will
soothe
her
with
the
flattering
hope
why
should
i
damp
our
present
ardors
by
anticipating
the
hour
when
we
must
part
why
should
i
suffuse
those
brilliant
eyes
with
the
tears
of
sorrow
or
wound
that
fondly
palpitating
heart
by
allowing
her
to
suspect
that
she
but
supplies
the
absence
of
an
rival
ah
let
not
my
thoughts
glance
that
way
let
not
imagination
bring
before
me
the
etherial
beauty
of
my
sibella
let
it
not
transport
me
to
her
arms
within
the
heaven
of
valmont
wood
or
i
shall
be
left
a
form
without
a
soul
and
be
excluded
from
the
enjoyment
that
i
now
admire
as
being
in
absence
my
solace
my
happiness
i
expected
i
should
have
been
dull
without
thee
murden
but
i
hardly
know
except
when
i
am
writing
that
thou
hast
left
me
i
dress
i
dance
i
ride
i
visit
i
am
visited
my
remittances
bring
me
all
i
wish
in
their
profusion
i
adore
and
am
adored
the
nights
and
days
are
alike
devoted
to
an
eternal
round
of
pleasures
and
lassitude
and
i
are
unacquainted
the
hearts
of
men
says
valmont
i
can
not
i
am
fascinated
with
their
manners
i
pant
to
acquire
the
same
soft
polish
and
their
endearing
complaisance
to
my
endeavours
that
graceful
polish
is
already
thine
and
there
i
envy
thee
i
envy
too
thy
reputation
but
i
hate
thy
cold
reserve
why
if
these
triumphs
which
are
attributed
to
thee
be
really
thine
why
conceal
them
others
can
tell
me
of
thy
successes
can
show
me
the
very
objects
for
whom
thou
hast
sighed
whom
thou
hast
obtained
when
i
alledge
that
i
found
thee
constantly
dissatisfied
contemplating
some
imaginary
being
complaining
that
too
much
or
too
little
pride
defective
manners
or
a
defective
mind
gave
thee
an
antidote
against
love
i
am
assured
that
it
was
the
mere
effect
of
an
overweening
vanity
seymour
who
pretends
to
know
thee
much
better
than
i
do
declares
thou
art
vain
beyond
man
belief
or
woman
example
he
is
thy
sworn
enemy
and
well
he
may
provided
his
charges
against
thee
be
true
for
the
other
night
in
the
confidence
of
wine
he
assured
me
that
thou
art
the
seducer
of
his
mistress
a
mistress
fond
and
faithful
till
she
listened
to
thy
seductions
is
it
possible
murden
thou
canst
have
been
thus
dishonourably
cruel
i
doubt
the
veracity
of
seymour
representation
for
i
think
thou
are
not
only
too
strict
for
the
transaction
but
too
inanimate
to
be
assailed
by
the
temptation
prithee
arthur
banish
this
thy
ever
impenetrable
reserve
and
tell
me
truly
whether
thou
art
inflated
with
victory
fastidious
from
change
or
whether
as
i
deem
thee
thou
are
not
really
too
cold
to
love
whether
thou
hast
not
cherished
the
indolent
caprice
of
thy
temper
till
it
has
deadened
thee
into
marble
once
more
i
thank
heaven
i
am
not
like
thee
ever
may
i
thrill
at
the
glance
the
smile
of
beauty
ever
may
i
live
to
know
no
business
but
pleasure
and
may
my
resources
ever
be
as
unconfined
as
my
wishes

montgomery
letter
ix
from
sibella
valmont
to
caroline
ashburn
it
is
now
a
week
since
one
evening
at
sunset
i
carried
your
letters
and
that
portrait
painted
by
clement
in
the
days
when
we
knew
no
sorrow
into
the
wood
where
shutting
out
every
remembrance
save
those
of
love
and
friendship
i
was
for
a
time
wrapped
in
the
sublimity
of
happiness
is
the
mind
so
much
fettered
by
its
earthly
clog
the
body
that
it
can
not
long
sustain
these
lofty
flights
soaring
as
it
were
into
divinity
but
must
ever
sink
back
to
its
portion
of
pains
and
penalties
for
this
i
have
before
experienced
and
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
pain
and
grief
suddenly
burst
in
upon
me
i
rushed
from
the
foot
of
my
oak
to
the
monument
and
resting
there
wept
with
a
bitterness
equal
in
degree
to
my
former
pleasure
nina
was
at
my
side
and
her
flying
from
me
into
the
wood
was
a
signal
that
some
one
approached
i
raised
my
head
and
beheld
descending
from
the
ruin
on
the
rock
the
tall
figure
of
a
venerable
man
with
a
white
and
flowing
beard
he
was
wrapped
in
a
sort
of
loose
gown
a
broad
hat
shaded
part
of
his
face
his
step
was
feeble
he
frequently
tottered
and
when
he
had
come
near
to
me
he
leaned
both
hands
on
his
staff
and
addressed
me
thus
virgin
weep
not
the
spirits
of
the
air
gather
round
you
and
form
a
band
so
sacred
that
the
malignant
demons
hover
at
a
distance
hopeless
of
approach
your
guardian
angel
presides
over
this
grove
here
mildew
mischief
and
mischance
can
not
harm
you
fair
virgin
weep
not
he
paused
i
said
are
you
he
continued
was
the
hallowed
tenant
of
yon
ruined
mansion
once
an
inhabitant
of
earth
it
was
my
lot
to
warn
the
guilty
and
to
soothe
the
mourner
well
may
such
tears
as
thine
draw
me
back
to
earth
i
come
the
spirit
of
consolation
fair
virgin
why
weepest
thou
know
i
said
the
sleep
of
death
is
eternal
that
the
grave
never
gives
back
to
form
and
substance
the
mouldering
body
and
it
indeed
matters
little
to
me
who
or
what
you
are
since
i
well
know
you
can
not
be
what
you
would
seem
i
stepped
down
from
the
monument
and
turned
up
the
wood
path
leading
to
the
castle
cried
he
you
doubt
my
supernatural
mission
view
my
testimony
behold
i
can
renovate
old
age
i
looked
back
the
beard
the
hat
the
mantle
were
cast
aside
and
a
young
man
of
graceful
form
and
fine
physiognomy
appeared
before
me
i
stood
an
instant
in
surprise
and
then
i
again
turned
toward
the
castle
he
stepped
forward
and
intercepted
my
path
with
outspread
arms
me
not
said
he
i
answered
do
not
fear
you
though
i
know
of
no
guardian
angels
but
my
innocence
and
fortitude
he
folded
his
arms
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
and
i
passed
on
without
further
interruption
when
andrew
brought
supper
into
my
apartment
i
asked
if
there
were
strangers
in
the
castle
and
andrew
shook
his
head
by
which
i
understood
that
he
did
not
know
if
there
were
any
the
following
morning
i
expected
my
uncle
commands
to
absent
myself
from
the
wood
and
though
no
message
came
i
did
absent
myself
both
on
that
day
and
on
the
succeeding
day
and
their
nights
confining
all
my
walks
to
the
open
ground
behind
the
castle
and
the
lawn
during
these
two
days
i
was
attended
only
by
margaret
poor
andrew
was
indisposed
banished
from
my
oak
deprived
of
my
nina
society
excluded
even
from
the
slight
intercourse
the
table
afforded
with
and
valmont
for
my
uncle
has
lately
determined
that
it
is
an
indelicate
custom
to
meet
together
at
stated
times
for
the
sole
purpose
of
eating
and
refreshment
is
now
served
up
to
each
in
our
separate
apartments
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
tell
you
caroline
how
much
i
felt
myself
while
these
two
days
and
two
nights
lasted
the
third
day
was
bleak
and
stormy
the
wind
roared
and
showers
fell
frequently
every
one
of
this
household
seems
at
all
times
loath
to
encounter
such
inclemencies
and
i
imagined
that
to
me
alone
these
were
things
of
little
moment
i
went
therefore
to
the
wood
but
ere
nina
had
expressed
half
her
joy
the
stranger
appeared
fly
me
he
said
you
do
not
fear
me
shun
you
replied
i
i
do
not
understand
you
if
you
shun
me
you
can
not
understand
me
do
not
deem
you
worthy
of
enquiry
i
said
you
came
with
pretences
of
falsehood
and
guile
and
those
are
coverings
that
virtue
ever
scorns
philosopher
he
exclaimed
me
how
you
preserve
such
vigour
such
animation
where
you
have
neither
rivalship
to
sustain
nor
admiration
to
excite
are
you
secluded
by
injustice
from
the
world
or
do
you
willingly
forsake
its
delights
to
live
the
life
of
hopeless
recollection
say
does
the
beloved
of
your
soul
sleep
in
that
monument
the
supposition
caroline
was
for
an
instant
too
agonizing
and
i
called
twice
on
the
name
of
clement
with
a
vehemence
that
made
this
man
start
his
face
flushed
with
colour
he
retreated
a
few
steps
and
looked
every
way
around
him
said
i
as
he
again
approached
beloved
lives
our
beings
are
incorporate
as
our
wishes
the
sepulchre
need
not
open
twice
no
tyranny
could
separate
us
in
death
but
who
are
you
i
added
come
hither
to
snatch
from
me
the
moments
i
would
dedicate
to
remembrances
of
past
pleasure
and
to
promising
expectation
then
your
heart
so
narrowed
by
love
that
it
can
admit
neither
friendship
nor
benevolence
i
answered
my
friendship
you
have
no
claim
for
we
are
not
equal
you
wear
a
mask
esteem
and
unreserved
confidence
are
the
only
foundations
of
friendship
as
he
had
done
on
the
former
day
he
again
intercepted
my
path
for
i
was
going
to
quit
the
wood
he
said
hear
me
patiently
or
i
may
cast
a
spell
around
you
he
interrupted
the
reply
i
was
beginning
to
make
thus
do
not
bid
you
fear
me
my
power
is
not
terrible
but
it
is
mighty
tell
me
then
he
added
you
no
sense
of
the
blessings
of
intercourse
have
you
never
reflected
on
the
selfishness
of
solitude
on
the
negative
virtues
of
the
recluse
find
you
here
said
i
valmont
wood
and
i
expect
therefore
that
you
already
know
my
seclusion
is
not
the
effect
of
my
choice
from
whom
other
than
yourself
am
i
to
learn
why
it
is
the
effect
of
your
submission
this
was
a
question
caroline
which
i
had
never
steadily
put
to
myself
and
i
stood
silent
some
moments
before
i
found
my
answer
i
said
am
not
yet
convinced
that
the
time
is
arrived
when
my
submission
ought
to
cease
rather
honestly
confess
he
replied
you
shun
a
stern
contention
with
that
power
which
here
detains
you
but
there
are
other
means
a
secret
escape
if
you
resolve
to
exert
yourself
for
that
purpose
i
said
am
not
weak
enough
to
descend
to
artifice
did
i
think
it
right
to
go
i
should
go
openly
then
might
valmont
try
his
opposing
strength
but
he
would
find
i
could
leap
swim
or
dive
and
that
moats
and
walls
are
feeble
barriers
to
a
determined
will
stay
stay
in
these
woods
for
ever
he
vehemently
exclaimed
not
into
the
world
where
artifice
might
assail
and
example
corrupt
that
noble
sincerity
or
if
as
i
think
your
courage
your
integrity
are
incorruptible
oh
yet
go
not
into
the
world
view
not
its
disgusting
follies
taste
not
its
chilling
disappointments
my
answer
was
am
accustomed
to
listen
to
inconsistencies
you
just
now
spoke
of
the
pleasures
and
blessings
of
society
as
he
did
not
reply
but
stood
as
though
he
was
musing
i
thought
i
could
pass
him
which
i
attempted
to
do
he
immediately
knelt
on
one
knee
before
me
spread
one
hand
on
his
bosom
and
said
are
above
my
controul
i
would
not
dare
profane
you
by
the
single
touch
of
my
finger
but
i
beseech
you
by
that
firmness
that
innocence
which
holds
distrust
and
danger
at
defiance
i
beseech
you
listen
to
me
a
few
short
moments
longer
you
any
thing
to
impart
which
can
interest
me
i
asked
him
have
that
which
ought
to
interest
you
he
rose
from
his
kneeling
posture
and
appeared
to
hesitate
he
then
added
have
many
many
faults
i
am
unstable
in
wise
resolutions
and
yielding
as
childhood
to
temptation
i
wanted
a
guide
a
monitor
i
sought
one
in
the
world
and
found
only
tempters
i
have
quitted
the
world
i
have
chosen
my
abode
in
that
ruin
there
i
would
fain
learn
to
amend
myself
i
want
to
learn
to
be
happy
but
i
come
not
to
that
ruin
to
banish
you
from
this
wood
this
is
your
selected
spot
and
that
is
mine
only
a
few
paces
divides
them
yet
if
you
say
it
must
be
so
the
distance
shall
be
as
impassable
as
though
entire
kingdoms
lay
between
us
ah
reflect
a
moment
before
your
single
word
forms
this
immense
barrier
a
moment
did
i
say
no
reflect
a
day
leave
me
now
in
silence
and
return
the
next
day
when
you
will
and
then
tell
me
if
you
could
not
sometimes
find
me
a
more
sympathizing
auditor
than
trees
and
marble
when
you
would
breathe
complaint
or
utter
joy
go
then
but
a
second
time
he
hesitated
and
when
he
spoke
again
his
articulation
was
changed
from
its
clear
decisive
character
to
a
thicker
lower
utterance
aware
he
said
there
are
certain
requisites
necessary
to
form
the
utility
of
my
solitude
uninterrupted
retirement
and
perfect
secresy
was
i
unjust
caroline
but
his
mention
of
secresy
instantly
filled
my
mind
with
a
supposition
that
his
words
wore
one
form
and
his
intentions
another
i
warned
him
to
depart
i
told
him
i
despised
concealment
that
i
had
ever
scorned
to
separate
my
wishes
from
my
acts
or
my
actions
from
my
words
i
said
his
caution
pointed
out
my
duty
i
bade
him
as
i
then
thought
a
final
adieu
i
proceeded
immediately
to
the
library
to
relate
this
conversation
to
my
uncle
there
i
was
told
that
my
uncle
was
gone
from
the
castle
not
to
return
till
four
days
were
past
i
then
requested
to
be
admitted
into
valmont
dressing
room
and
she
received
me
her
conduct
disgusted
me
extremely
at
the
time
and
i
have
since
thought
it
very
extraordinary
that
valmont
should
doubt
my
veracity
scarcely
had
i
described
the
manner
in
which
the
person
in
the
wood
first
came
to
me
than
valmont
broke
my
narration
by
asking
me
over
and
over
again
i
know
not
how
many
times
i
indeed
seen
a
hermit
come
out
of
the
ruin
was
i
quite
sure
i
had
seen
him
could
it
really
be
true
not
disposed
to
hear
such
offensive
repetitions
i
declined
entering
any
further
into
the
story
and
merely
said
that
if
the
person
was
a
visitor
in
the
castle
it
might
be
proper
for
her
to
signify
to
him
that
his
intrusion
in
the
rock
and
wood
would
be
displeasing
to
my
uncle
and
highly
inconvenient
to
me
i
went
to
my
own
apartments
on
the
next
morning
i
rose
as
i
frequently
do
at
the
first
dawn
of
day
do
you
recollect
the
situation
of
my
apartments
you
will
certainly
remember
that
the
wing
is
rather
distant
from
that
part
of
the
body
of
the
castle
where
most
of
the
family
inhabit
you
know
too
that
my
rooms
open
into
a
long
gallery
but
you
never
explored
this
gallery
my
hours
with
you
were
rich
in
pleasure
and
variety
and
i
thought
not
then
of
the
solitary
haunts
to
which
i
fly
when
i
seek
amusement
and
find
none
this
gallery
at
the
remote
end
from
the
body
of
the
castle
closes
with
a
stair
case
these
stairs
descend
into
a
narrow
and
winding
passage
of
the
west
tower
and
lead
to
the
door
of
the
armoury
it
is
probable
you
never
saw
either
the
west
tower
or
the
armoury
they
are
both
out
of
repair
and
altogether
out
of
use
nor
do
i
recollect
any
that
i
ever
saw
one
of
the
family
enter
them
but
clement
and
myself
in
very
tempestuous
weather
the
armoury
was
a
favourite
place
of
resort
for
us
the
various
implements
and
cases
of
steel
with
which
it
is
furnished
were
subjects
of
wonder
and
conjecture
besides
it
is
a
hall
of
large
dimensions
and
we
possessed
it
so
free
of
interruptions
that
it
served
better
for
play
and
recreation
than
any
other
apartment
we
were
allowed
to
frequent
within
the
castle
at
a
very
early
hour
on
the
succeeding
morning
as
i
before
said
i
rose
and
left
my
chamber
to
walk
in
the
armoury
after
i
had
gone
down
the
stairs
and
as
i
had
nearly
reached
the
end
of
the
dark
stone
passage
i
heard
a
sudden
creaking
noise
but
whether
or
not
it
proceeded
from
the
armoury
i
could
not
be
certain
i
entered
the
armoury
the
door
closed
heavily
after
me
there
was
scarcely
light
enough
to
distinguish
the
surrounding
i
stood
but
all
was
silent
i
walked
about
and
other
thoughts
entirely
effaced
an
impression
of
something
unusual
in
the
noise
till
again
and
in
a
louder
degree
it
assailed
me
i
hastened
toward
the
door
but
the
voice
i
had
heard
in
the
wood
called
me
to
stay
i
turned
round
and
the
same
figure
was
before
me
andrew
interrupts
me
my
uncle
is
returned
home
has
something
to
communicate
and
expects
me
now
i
go
in
continuation
farewel
thou
precious
resemblance
i
must
part
with
thee
from
yesterday
until
the
present
hour
thou
hast
been
mine
farewel
then
exquisite
shadow
caroline
i
left
my
letter
unfinished
yesterday
and
hastened
to
the
library
hither
child
my
uncle
said
as
i
entered
tell
me
if
this
be
a
likeness
he
presented
to
me
a
small
case
and
i
beheld
the
picture
of
clement
i
folded
both
hands
over
it
on
my
bosom
i
had
not
words
to
thank
valmont
but
the
tears
that
rolled
upon
my
cheeks
were
tears
of
gratitude
ordered
clement
my
uncle
continued
send
me
his
portrait
done
by
an
eminent
artist
and
his
obedience
has
been
as
prompt
as
i
could
desire
you
may
retire
sibella
and
take
the
picture
with
you
but
you
are
to
bring
it
back
to
the
library
after
my
dinner
hour
only
conceive
caroline
how
i
flew
back
to
my
apartment
think
how
many
fond
avowals
how
many
rapturous
caresses
i
bestowed
on
the
insensible
image
while
i
eat
it
lay
before
me
and
while
i
slept
the
little
that
i
did
sleep
it
rested
on
my
pillow
i
have
counted
the
stroke
of
five
from
the
great
clock
now
valmont
dines
and
the
picture
is
no
longer
mine
i
have
placed
it
in
its
case
ready
for
the
hand
of
valmont
i
become
dispirited
farewel
precious
shadow
farewel
also
caroline
to
you
sibella
valmont
i
have
torn
the
seal
away
from
this
letter
i
am
breathless
with
the
tidings
clement
my
clement
is
to
return
oh
caroline
caroline
did
you
ever
weep
for
joy
letter
x
from
caroline
ashburn
to
sibella
valmont
certainly
a
picture
is
at
all
times
a
very
pretty
toy
and
i
can
readily
imagine
that
the
picture
of
an
absent
lover
must
be
indeed
a
precious
blessing
but
you
will
forgive
me
sibella
if
i
honestly
confess
that
i
have
a
hundred
times
since
the
receipt
of
your
letter
wished
clement
had
not
been
so
willing
or
his
artist
not
so
ready
oh
that
valmont
had
withheld
the
picture
but
one
hour
longer
then
would
the
womanish
curiosity
of
caroline
ashburn
have
been
gratified
for
trust
me
sibella
your
surprise
at
finding
your
enigmatical
hermit
in
the
armoury
could
not
exceed
my
disappointment
at
leaving
him
and
you
there
without
further
explanation
i
have
imagined
and
imagined
returned
to
the
subject
and
quitted
it
again
more
wearied
than
before
and
though
i
did
after
a
time
discover
that
i
never
should
by
the
mere
aid
of
suppositions
find
of
what
materials
your
hermit
is
composed
yet
i
have
persisted
in
comparing
accidents
and
combining
circumstances
perhaps
totally
remote
from
each
other
with
the
vain
hope
of
tracing
him
knowing
how
much
your
uncle
worships
mystery
i
sometimes
think
it
may
be
one
of
his
stratagems
sometimes
that
psha
the
folly
of
conjecture
grows
with
me
pardon
me
sibella
you
are
above
these
things
uniform
in
rectitude
you
steadily
pursue
the
path
before
you
nor
mislead
yourself
to
follow
the
swervings
of
others
in
compassion
however
to
the
longings
of
your
friend
hasten
to
communicate
the
remainder
of
this
your
adventure
our
poor
indian
is
dead
she
survived
her
reception
at
barlowe
hall
only
about
ten
days
and
during
the
visits
i
made
her
i
never
found
her
capable
of
sustaining
any
conversation
with
me
from
her
as
she
was
long
a
resident
in
the
family
i
hoped
and
expected
to
have
been
informed
by
what
means
my
father
amassed
his
fortune
for
the
suspicions
which
i
find
generally
attached
to
east
indian
riches
sit
heavy
on
my
mind
i
do
not
love
to
encourage
suspicion
for
it
is
cowardly
nor
can
i
indeed
fairly
give
my
opinions
the
name
of
suspicions
for
i
am
persuaded
that
in
whatever
clime
or
country
it
be
found
the
mind
that
grasps
at
such
inordinate
wealth
must
be
vicious
and
that
there
can
be
but
little
to
choose
among
the
degrees
of
vice
wherewith
it
is
obtained
yet
being
convinced
as
to
that
point
i
still
wish
to
know
the
employments
of
my
father
life
for
it
is
possible
there
may
be
some
retribution
to
make
to
individuals
a
voyage
to
india
for
such
a
purpose
sibella
would
be
but
as
a
pleasant
summer
excursion
your
letter
has
been
sent
after
me
to
bath
for
barlowe
hall
no
longer
retains
her
circle
of
gay
visitors
the
ulson
family
have
gone
i
forget
where
and
taken
the
winderhams
with
them
while
we
together
with
sir
thomas
lady
barlowe
and
colonel
ridson
arrived
at
bath
last
week
the
season
is
crowded
and
my
mother
and
the
nabob
think
themselves
fortunate
in
having
been
able
to
secure
one
large
and
commodious
house
for
the
reception
of
both
families
this
arrangement
lady
barlowe
and
ashburn
profess
to
find
very
pleasing
they
declare
a
violent
friendship
for
each
other
and
use
it
as
a
cloak
for
the
workings
of
their
secret
malignities
my
mother
is
the
object
of
lady
barlowe
envy
for
the
nabob
fears
have
made
him
covetous
he
hoards
his
diamonds
in
their
cases
and
lady
glitter
is
by
the
happier
uncontrouled
ashburn
on
the
other
hand
lady
barlowe
has
youth
and
has
beauty
and
these
attractions
ashburn
finds
the
lustre
of
the
diamond
will
not
altogether
outshine
though
there
are
many
among
the
venal
crowd
who
daily
offer
up
at
the
shrine
of
wealth
the
incense
due
to
merit
wit
and
beauty
sir
thomas
i
believe
considers
himself
as
bound
to
play
both
his
own
part
and
his
nephew
and
to
overwhelm
us
with
the
attentions
and
kindnesses
his
ungracious
arthur
withheld
did
i
not
tell
you
or
rather
did
i
not
intimate
that
before
murden
made
his
appearance
amongst
us
the
baronet
evidently
bestowed
him
upon
me
but
alas
scarcely
had
he
arrived
when
his
uncle
remembering
the
value
of
a
certain
old
proverb
left
me
to
seek
another
lover
and
gave
or
would
have
given
his
nephew
to
my
mother
it
was
highly
whimsical
to
see
the
baronet
labours
to
promote
this
end
he
dared
not
be
quite
certain
that
murden
although
dependent
on
him
would
yield
him
an
implicit
obedience
and
yet
according
to
his
understanding
the
scheme
had
so
many
and
such
important
recommendations
that
they
were
not
to
be
hastily
rejected
fearing
to
be
if
not
convinced
should
he
at
once
resort
to
his
nephew
opinion
the
baronet
would
not
venture
to
do
so
but
secure
in
the
presence
of
numbers
he
grew
bold
at
hint
and
soon
made
his
plan
fully
comprehended
by
every
person
present
and
put
his
ingenuity
to
the
trial
to
find
methods
how
to
express
his
disapprobation
without
being
rude
and
offensive
to
the
feelings
of
any
one
i
can
not
say
that
ashburn
appeared
to
think
sir
thomas
very
absurd
in
his
designs
after
playing
this
game
of
hint
till
the
party
talked
of
separating
the
baronet
then
acquired
courage
enough
to
make
a
direct
attack
on
his
nephew
the
latter
gave
an
explicit
refusal
to
the
proposal
and
the
former
for
some
days
lost
his
good
humour
and
his
patience
it
was
i
suppose
in
consequence
of
this
marked
displeasure
from
his
uncle
that
murden
thought
of
paying
a
visit
to
a
friend
at
some
distance
from
barlowe
hall
at
first
sir
thomas
opposed
it
not
but
when
murden
was
actually
on
the
point
of
going
the
nabob
relaxed
his
solemn
displeasure
and
earnestly
requested
arthur
not
to
leave
him
arthur
in
his
turn
became
inflexible
and
would
not
be
intreated
he
had
written
he
said
to
his
friend
and
go
he
must
at
length
however
he
condescendingly
offered
to
hasten
to
join
us
at
bath
and
having
thus
accommodated
their
difference
the
nabob
and
his
nephew
parted
very
good
friends
this
serious
altercation
on
the
subject
of
murden
quitting
our
party
took
place
in
the
breakfast
parlour
lady
mary
bowden
invited
me
soon
after
to
walk
with
her
you
think
said
she
putting
her
arm
through
mine
as
soon
as
we
had
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
hall
door
murden
is
very
obstinately
bent
on
making
this
excursion
think
him
determined
answered
i
perhaps
very
properly
so
hangs
a
tale
said
lady
mary
do
love
tales
lady
mary
she
looked
at
me
and
smiled
i
believe
you
are
willing
to
hear
this
she
said
i
am
resolved
to
tell
it
you
lady
mary
certainly
did
not
lay
that
to
my
charge
of
which
i
was
undeserving
for
i
quietly
suffered
her
to
proceed
in
her
story
it
was
an
accusation
against
murden
that
his
pretended
visit
of
friendship
to
villier
was
in
fact
a
visit
of
a
different
kind
to
a
female
in
villier
neighbourhood
of
whom
lady
mary
said
murden
had
not
been
the
original
seducer
that
she
had
been
lured
from
her
friends
by
another
person
and
that
having
preferred
the
attractions
of
murden
she
made
a
pretence
of
returning
to
her
friends
in
order
to
be
the
more
conveniently
under
his
protection
lady
mary
added
a
number
of
little
corroborating
anecdotes
which
gave
the
affair
a
striking
appearance
of
matter
of
fact
and
i
was
inclined
to
believe
it
till
i
recollected
how
much
my
opinion
had
been
misled
by
appearances
in
the
affair
of
peggy
of
which
i
spoke
to
you
in
my
last
letter
warned
by
that
example
i
began
to
doubt
the
representations
of
her
ladyship
and
begged
she
would
join
with
me
in
having
better
hopes
of
murden
and
endeavouring
to
discountenance
the
unsupported
assertions
that
were
spread
abroad
concerning
him
lady
mary
willingly
promised
and
i
dare
say
as
readily
forgot
it
the
very
next
instant
as
i
told
you
sibella
my
suspicions
of
peggy
i
will
now
tell
you
her
history
at
once
without
going
through
the
round
of
circumstances
that
brought
me
acquainted
with
it
in
murden
own
words
you
have
learned
that
the
pleasant
farm
was
his
house
of
call
in
the
shooting
season
the
farmer
is
an
industrious
and
worthy
man
and
his
daughter
peggy
is
or
rather
was
ere
disappointment
fed
upon
her
bloom
a
very
pretty
girl
joseph
murden
servant
fell
in
love
with
peggy
and
peggy
with
joseph
he
was
sober
he
had
some
expectations
from
friends
and
his
master
thought
very
well
of
him
and
all
this
together
induced
the
father
of
peggy
to
consent
the
marriage
was
settled
as
a
certain
thing
but
a
delay
of
time
was
agreed
on
among
all
parties
and
joseph
went
to
london
with
his
master
it
so
happened
that
at
christmas
joseph
father
died
and
as
he
was
a
shopkeeper
in
a
country
town
joseph
might
if
he
chose
succeed
him
and
marry
peggy
directly
he
consulted
murden
who
approved
much
of
his
designs
and
likewise
gave
him
thirty
pound
to
assist
in
forwarding
them
thus
rich
in
pocket
and
in
expectation
ere
he
commenced
shopkeeper
joseph
went
first
to
stay
a
week
at
peggy
farm
to
settle
the
time
of
marriage
alas
the
week
began
with
much
happiness
and
laid
the
foundation
for
much
sorrow
peggy
became
too
indulgent
to
her
lover
and
in
consequence
her
lover
cruelly
forgot
to
come
back
as
he
had
promised
at
six
weeks
end
and
marry
her
peggy
father
had
a
strong
sense
of
honest
pride
he
disdained
to
solicit
an
ungenerous
man
on
the
contrary
he
exhorted
peggy
to
forget
him
be
industrious
and
hereafter
irreproachable
but
while
he
was
thus
daily
kind
to
peggy
the
poor
old
man
as
he
told
murden
underneath
my
window
wept
through
sleepless
nights
for
peggy
naughtiness
murden
knew
nothing
of
these
transactions
he
had
not
called
at
the
since
he
arrived
at
barlowe
hall
when
we
met
peggy
in
the
narrow
lane
i
can
now
well
account
for
her
blushes
and
his
surprise
he
struck
with
her
appearance
and
her
manner
left
us
to
fish
and
went
to
inform
himself
at
the
farm
why
peggy
was
still
in
that
part
of
the
world
the
father
was
absent
but
the
mother
told
him
the
whole
story
and
he
promised
to
do
all
that
lay
within
his
power
to
restore
the
peace
of
the
family
it
was
peggy
earnest
longing
to
save
herself
from
present
pain
at
any
future
risk
and
murden
thought
it
right
to
forward
her
wishes
he
sent
for
joseph
who
was
growing
rich
at
five
and
twenty
miles
distance
but
who
not
having
more
vices
than
his
neighbours
was
willing
enough
to
be
ruled
by
a
greater
man
than
himself
and
accordingly
became
either
really
or
seemingly
very
penitent
the
end
of
the
whole
is
that
present
disgrace
is
salved
by
marriage
a
foolish
and
impotent
remedy
in
my
opinion
removing
a
partial
evil
most
probably
to
begin
a
lasting
one
how
i
misjudged
murden
in
this
affair
others
too
may
have
misjudged
him
i
persuade
myself
they
have
men
my
dear
sibella
have
not
that
enthusiasm
and
vigour
in
their
friendships
that
we
possess
i
never
could
get
murden
to
talk
much
of
clement
montgomery
though
i
urged
him
to
it
repeatedly
as
an
incentive
thereto
as
well
as
to
gratify
my
own
feelings
i
made
you
and
your
manners
a
perpetual
theme
of
conversation
when
i
held
conversations
with
murden
perhaps
my
descriptions
interested
him
for
he
was
never
unwilling
to
listen
to
me
though
he
uniformly
persisted
in
repressing
my
enquiries
if
they
led
to
the
subject
of
his
friendship
for
clement
with
an
insuperable
too
vain
possibly
to
praise
the
perfections
of
another
yet
too
honest
to
deny
their
existence
inconsistent
being
inconsistent
in
all
things
that
i
know
of
him
except
in
his
conduct
to
his
uncle
there
he
is
firm
settled
and
manly
respectful
but
never
fawning
he
opposes
sir
thomas
without
petulance
and
obeys
him
without
humiliation
such
conduct
will
ever
secure
its
proper
reward
the
nabob
feels
his
superiority
and
still
loves
him
sir
thomas
barlowe
rejoices
i
am
glad
while
ashburn
and
lady
barlowe
are
neither
pleased
nor
displeased
that
is
the
day
of
murden
arrival
the
other
ladies
of
his
acquaintance
here
to
whom
i
have
been
introduced
are
not
so
indifferent
as
the
two
last
mentioned
to
murden
appearance
for
i
have
already
heard
some
praise
him
indiscriminately
as
lady
laura
bowden
would
and
others
comment
upon
his
attractions
and
his
vices
with
as
little
true
feeling
of
either
as
lady
mary
did
i
am
glad
he
comes
to
bath
for
i
shall
now
see
him
amidst
a
multitude
where
new
faces
new
forms
will
continually
present
themselves
where
temptations
will
rush
in
crowds
and
where
the
sober
pace
of
reflection
is
outstripped
by
the
flying
speed
of
pleasure
if
i
do
not
now
learn
to
appreciate
his
character
it
will
be
owing
rather
to
the
idleness
of
my
discernment
than
its
want
of
space
enough
to
practice
in
do
not
imagine
dear
sibella
that
because
i
have
run
through
so
many
lines
without
a
word
of
congratulation
i
am
insensible
to
the
joy
which
swells
in
your
bosom
on
the
expected
return
of
your
lover
i
do
indeed
congratulate
you
your
uncle
becomes
reasonable
his
mysteries
and
his
contradictions
vanish
sibella
expects
her
clement
and
the
heavy
gates
of
valmont
castle
will
fly
back
that
peace
and
liberty
may
enter
nevertheless
in
the
prosperity
of
your
expectations
forget
not
the
hermit
in
the
armoury
and
the
longings
of
your
caroline
ashburn
letter
xi
from
clement
montgomery
to
arthur
murden
dear
arthur
precisely
such
a
command
to
return
home
so
sudden
and
so
unexpected
as
you
received
five
months
past
from
sir
thomas
barlowe
have
i
received
from
valmont
but
the
speed
of
your
obedience
bore
no
proportion
to
mine
for
hither
have
i
come
with
a
rapidity
which
scarcely
yielded
to
rest
and
refreshment
here
i
am
already
arrived
almost
within
sight
of
the
castle
prison
like
towers
and
here
have
i
been
traversing
the
paltry
room
of
an
inn
for
one
hour
and
three
quarters
how
much
longer
i
shall
stay
here
i
know
not
but
by
heaven
were
i
to
depart
with
a
thorough
good
will
it
would
be
to
take
the
road
back
to
the
continent
arthur
arthur
what
a
lesson
it
is
that
i
have
to
get
by
rote
assured
clement
says
valmont
in
his
letter
you
can
not
have
departed
from
the
rule
of
conduct
i
desired
you
to
pursue
i
do
not
doubt
but
that
you
will
joyfully
quit
the
haunts
of
treacherous
sordid
men
to
enjoy
with
me
the
pleasant
solitude
of
valmont
castle
no
one
knows
better
than
yourself
dear
murden
how
closely
i
have
pursued
valmont
of
and
i
think
you
can
guess
also
how
greatly
i
shall
now
the
pleasant
solitude
of
valmont
for
a
week
a
month
perchance
the
blooming
sibella
will
render
the
wilderness
a
world
could
i
flatter
myself
that
valmont
recals
me
to
give
her
to
my
arms
how
i
should
bound
over
the
distance
which
now
separates
us
no
arthur
no
such
blessing
awaits
your
luckless
friend
i
am
to
look
on
her
as
a
sister
says
valmont
good
heaven
and
he
recals
me
to
stand
perpetually
on
the
brink
of
a
precipice
for
how
can
i
hear
her
look
on
her
touch
her
and
be
a
brother
nay
the
very
first
moment
of
my
entrance
into
that
castle
may
undo
me
for
she
will
rush
to
my
embrace
she
will
cover
me
with
kisses
and
his
chilling
eye
will
be
on
me
had
valmont
left
me
with
the
cottagers
my
parents
i
had
never
seen
sibella
then
i
had
dreamed
through
a
stupid
existence
without
knowing
life
and
love
had
he
kept
me
the
recluse
of
his
woods
she
had
by
this
time
infused
her
wild
untamed
spirit
unto
me
and
i
should
have
torn
her
from
him
imagining
we
could
live
on
berries
and
drink
water
no
more
of
that
arthur
no
no
i
now
see
the
full
value
of
my
obedience
to
valmont
commands
for
i
would
by
heaven
rather
this
moment
endure
the
rack
than
be
blasted
to
a
life
of
hateful
indigence
abhorred
poverty
ay
ay
i
must
obey
must
obey
murden
must
while
my
heart
my
desires
my
wishes
are
still
the
same
must
cloak
them
to
please
valmont
eye
to
fit
his
fashion
i
must
be
to
my
charming
sibella
must
abjure
a
world
i
adore
rail
at
men
curse
i
invite
you
to
the
castle
arthur
come
and
visit
me
in
my
disguise
come
and
by
reminding
me
of
times
past
keep
alive
my
hopes
and
expectations
of
times
that
may
come
here
while
i
stay
in
this
inn
i
prepare
for
the
first
essay
of
my
practice
in
the
cynical
science
i
have
been
recollecting
as
well
as
i
could
the
scraps
and
remnants
of
valmont
harangue
of
man
and
womankind
and
i
think
i
have
made
of
my
memory
a
sort
of
common
place
book
of
this
delectable
jargon
from
which
i
can
pick
and
cull
for
all
valmont
occasions
half
an
hour
or
so
i
stood
before
the
to
find
what
face
was
fittest
to
carry
to
the
castle
the
glances
i
have
of
late
been
used
to
may
do
for
the
wood
when
valmont
is
out
of
sight
but
they
will
not
suit
the
library
they
speak
a
promptitude
for
pleasure
i
must
hide
them
under
my
cloak
and
borrow
something
if
i
can
of
sallow
hues
yet
these
prudent
necessary
considerations
found
not
an
entrance
into
my
mind
till
i
came
within
six
miles
of
valmont
castle
i
was
engrossed
by
a
circumstance
that
hastened
me
to
fly
from
the
scene
where
i
had
known
so
much
of
joy
and
pleasure
abandoned
artful
cursed
deceiver
i
speak
arthur
of
janetta
who
has
plundered
duped
and
jilted
me
how
well
she
feigned
her
passion
how
artfully
she
drew
me
on
continually
to
sacrifice
to
her
avarice
and
vanity
till
i
was
almost
beggared
and
with
what
management
did
she
evade
my
first
suspicions
and
elude
my
enquiries
till
at
length
an
accident
gave
me
proof
too
strong
to
be
doubted
or
evaded
that
she
was
falser
than
falsehood
that
she
was
at
once
mine
and
the
mistress
of
her
friend
husband
i
would
not
trust
myself
to
hear
her
plead
in
her
defence
i
would
not
stand
the
fascinations
of
her
divine
face
but
having
received
valmont
letter
an
hour
before
i
ordered
my
clothes
to
be
packed
up
and
without
taking
leave
of
one
single
acquaintance
i
set
off
post
for
england
ha
was
ever
any
thing
more
unfortunate
than
this
ross
steward
and
one
of
the
grooms
from
the
castle
have
come
into
this
inn
and
know
i
am
here
the
groom
i
could
manage
but
ross
is
not
to
be
tampered
with
and
as
sure
as
i
live
he
will
inform
valmont
of
my
passing
half
a
day
so
near
the
castle
had
i
possessed
an
atom
of
common
understanding
i
might
have
foreseen
such
an
accident
and
now
for
want
of
this
small
share
of
foresight
i
am
panic
struck
ross
was
going
from
not
to
the
castle
therefore
i
will
take
one
quarter
of
an
hour
to
chill
my
looks
into
brotherhood
and
then
brave
the
worst
clement
montgomery
letter
xii
from
sibella
valmont
to
caroline
ashburn
hail
dearest
caroline
yes
peace
and
liberty
with
every
blessing
for
which
sibella
pants
will
enter
when
the
gates
of
valmont
castle
fly
back
to
receive
her
clement
i
do
not
count
the
minutes
for
that
would
be
to
make
time
more
tedious
but
i
walk
with
a
quicker
step
with
a
firmer
mien
i
am
ever
seeking
change
of
place
and
sleep
and
i
are
almost
unacquainted
yet
other
countenances
wear
the
uniformity
they
did
before
no
matter
but
a
short
time
and
when
i
went
to
compare
my
own
transports
i
can
look
on
the
eye
or
read
the
heart
of
clement
and
find
them
more
than
equalled
my
thoughts
haste
so
pressingly
to
the
future
that
it
requires
an
effort
stronger
than
you
can
conceive
you
who
expect
no
clement
to
turn
them
back
to
the
detail
you
require
i
can
not
be
minute
as
to
a
conversation
in
which
the
hermit
as
you
call
him
was
chief
speaker
for
some
parts
of
it
i
have
forgotten
and
others
i
did
not
understand
he
spoke
with
a
rapidity
which
made
him
almost
unintelligible
and
his
pauses
seemed
rather
the
effect
of
sudden
anxiety
than
of
attention
to
my
answers
he
talked
of
escapes
and
accidents
in
a
disjointed
manner
so
that
from
his
broken
sentences
one
might
have
supposed
he
meant
i
had
placed
him
in
hazard
and
that
i
had
conducted
him
to
the
armoury
that
which
i
remember
most
clearly
was
the
earnestness
with
which
he
urged
me
to
lay
no
future
restraint
on
myself
he
said
his
interruptions
were
now
ended
but
he
added
and
several
times
repeated
we
should
one
day
or
other
meet
again
he
then
spoke
something
of
dangers
but
i
know
not
whether
they
related
to
himself
or
me
he
was
very
pale
wildness
and
apprehension
were
marked
on
his
features
he
wore
his
hermit
hat
and
cloak
but
the
former
was
quite
and
both
disfigured
by
dust
and
cobwebs
once
in
the
vehemence
of
his
speech
he
raised
his
arm
the
folds
of
his
cloak
became
loosened
and
i
saw
a
sword
glitter
beneath
it
i
left
him
in
the
armoury
nor
have
i
entered
it
since
the
wood
is
all
my
own
again
no
figure
glides
upon
me
but
that
my
imagination
loves
to
form
on
the
day
succeeding
that
in
which
i
found
the
hermit
in
the
armoury
i
saw
valmont
walking
on
the
terrace
i
went
to
her
and
spoke
of
the
circumstance
she
appeared
agitated
by
my
words
she
grasped
my
hand
and
said
the
finger
of
heaven
was
in
it
and
she
talked
further
in
a
strange
way
of
something
that
she
called
and
she
would
not
be
me
she
said
for
worlds
i
do
fear
the
disorder
has
affected
her
intellects
but
a
little
interval
between
me
and
perfect
happiness
i
can
not
write
you
know
caroline
i
love
you
but
now
indeed
i
can
not
write
dearest
caroline
adieu
sibella
valmont
letter
xiii
from
clement
montgomery
to
arthur
murden
all
gone
murden
the
pinnacle
of
my
hopes
and
expectations
is
crumbled
to
the
dust
where
shall
i
turn
me
or
what
consolation
shall
i
ask
arthur
do
not
bestow
on
me
that
insolent
pity
which
only
augments
misfortune
i
am
not
the
same
clement
montgomery
you
formerly
knew
brought
up
in
the
castle
with
homage
and
respect
afterward
introduced
into
the
circles
of
fashion
as
valmont
heir
and
supported
with
an
allowance
equal
to
that
expectation
no
i
am
only
one
to
whom
he
gave
an
accidental
kindness
on
whom
he
bestowed
temporary
favours
and
whom
he
now
condemns
to
the
abhorred
life
of
care
and
plodding
with
the
lower
orders
of
mankind
cursed
be
the
hour
in
which
i
entered
that
inn
from
whence
i
wrote
you
my
last
letter
in
that
hour
my
misfortunes
began
when
i
arrived
at
the
castle
valmont
was
from
home
every
creature
rejoiced
in
my
arrival
even
the
insensible
valmont
lavished
caresses
on
me
and
praised
the
improvements
of
my
person
ah
but
how
can
i
tell
you
of
sibella
joy
i
know
nothing
that
describes
it
so
unrestrained
so
exquisitely
soft
and
tender
exquisitely
delicate
in
all
its
effusions
she
appeared
to
me
quite
a
new
creature
i
could
not
but
acknowledge
to
myself
that
her
charms
surpassed
even
the
faithless
janetta
charms
i
loved
her
the
first
moment
i
beheld
her
better
than
i
had
ever
loved
her
before
and
i
in
secret
cursed
myself
for
having
sacrificed
my
innocence
and
cursed
you
also
arthur
who
once
said
her
in
other
one
hour
i
passed
in
heaven
and
then
valmont
returned
home
ross
came
with
him
i
saw
them
ride
over
the
bridge
and
i
trembled
with
apprehension
valmont
did
not
leave
me
long
in
doubt
for
when
i
would
have
hastened
to
the
library
i
was
stopped
by
his
gentleman
who
denied
me
admittance
three
days
valmont
preserved
his
inflexible
resentment
and
these
three
days
were
passed
with
sibella
she
knew
not
why
her
uncle
was
in
anger
with
me
and
she
reviled
him
and
cheered
me
with
her
smiles
and
sweet
sounds
of
love
that
i
might
not
droop
at
my
reception
she
bade
me
talk
of
the
world
alas
it
was
an
alluring
theme
and
i
talked
with
more
ardor
than
discretion
of
its
abounding
delights
i
did
not
tell
her
though
arthur
of
all
the
delights
i
had
tasted
there
on
the
fourth
morning
a
messenger
came
to
summon
me
to
the
library
i
turned
pale
i
loitered
fly
clement
said
sibella
away
these
apprehensions
recollect
my
dear
dear
clement
that
my
favourite
maxim
is
that
disappointment
should
be
always
the
forerunner
of
pleasure
who
knows
but
valmont
at
this
moment
waits
to
bestow
happiness
on
us
i
went
with
very
different
forebodings
from
sibella
i
entered
valmont
presence
he
received
me
like
a
stern
haughty
judge
i
stood
an
abashed
fearful
culprit
he
bitterly
inveighed
against
my
want
of
duty
in
resting
so
long
in
that
inn
so
near
his
castle
after
two
years
absence
he
demanded
the
reasons
of
my
conduct
and
i
stammered
an
incoherent
something
about
want
of
horses
and
having
had
letters
to
write
he
saw
i
lied
he
knew
i
lied
sir
said
he
after
a
pause
will
pass
that
by
for
the
present
now
give
me
an
account
of
your
travels
and
their
effect
upon
your
opinions
no
matter
what
i
said
arthur
is
enough
to
tell
you
of
the
manner
it
seems
i
had
not
rancour
enough
for
valmont
i
could
not
belie
my
feelings
with
sufficient
warmth
i
could
not
renounce
enormities
i
had
never
known
and
which
have
no
existence
but
in
his
own
inflated
imagination
sensible
that
the
manner
of
my
description
and
expectations
bore
no
sort
of
affinity
i
became
more
and
more
confused
until
one
of
those
frowns
and
gestures
which
at
nine
years
old
made
me
tremble
for
my
life
now
imposed
on
me
a
sudden
silence
my
sentence
remained
unfinished
and
valmont
leaning
upon
the
table
beat
an
angry
tattoo
with
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
his
eyes
rolled
from
one
object
to
another
without
resting
upon
any
thing
it
might
be
a
minute
or
more
perhaps
in
my
estimation
it
was
an
age
that
we
remained
thus
suddenly
sibella
opened
the
door
and
entered
a
little
way
in
a
light
and
cheerful
manner
but
seeing
the
state
we
were
in
she
hesitated
turned
an
enquiring
look
upon
me
and
then
made
a
graceful
bend
to
valmont
now
sibella
said
he
bid
you
come
hither
came
sir
she
replied
in
a
sweet
but
irresolute
accent
and
then
she
again
looked
at
me
say
by
what
authority
do
you
come
since
you
have
not
mine
while
valmont
sternly
asked
that
question
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
my
pale
perplexed
countenance
sir
said
she
anxiously
you
love
clement
now
valmont
made
no
reply
for
two
or
three
seconds
i
dared
not
look
up
to
see
whether
he
was
more
or
less
angry
me
child
said
he
presently
to
sibella
has
that
boy
said
to
you
since
he
returned
so
to
valmont
castle
sibella
paused
me
no
falsehoods
said
he
still
more
sternly
she
repeated
in
a
forcible
tone
the
colour
mounting
higher
in
her
cheeks
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
falsehoods
i
paused
because
i
thought
i
could
not
readily
collect
the
matter
of
our
conversations
into
the
compass
of
one
answer
i
might
indeed
have
done
it
for
they
have
been
uniform
we
have
talked
sir
of
our
unchanging
truth
of
times
past
and
times
to
come
of
the
world
of
its
pleasures
and
its
virtues
of
of
it
cried
valmont
darting
on
me
a
glance
of
extreme
wrath
talked
you
say
of
times
that
are
to
come
pray
who
endowed
you
with
the
gift
of
foretelling
what
times
are
to
come
our
endowments
are
perfectly
natural
we
do
not
presume
to
tell
of
the
future
except
as
far
as
it
is
confined
to
the
feelings
of
our
own
hearts
we
know
fully
and
entirely
know
that
our
hearts
must
cease
to
throb
with
life
when
that
love
is
extinguished
which
was
born
and
nurtured
to
its
growth
under
the
encouragement
of
your
approbation
do
not
frown
on
me
sir
i
i
valmont
did
not
speak
while
sibella
made
a
faultering
stop
she
shortly
went
on
again
thus
confess
sir
that
i
do
fear
you
habit
is
prevalent
with
me
and
i
still
tremble
at
your
frowns
i
would
not
offend
you
but
i
must
expostulate
oh
be
not
i
intreat
you
be
not
angry
with
clement
for
loving
me
he
must
love
me
our
love
is
the
very
soul
of
our
being
give
us
then
sir
new
life
unalloyed
felicity
say
she
seized
my
hand
and
leading
me
close
up
to
valmont
she
added
with
rapid
vehemence
now
that
he
is
mine
and
i
am
his
for
ever
her
emphasis
made
me
tremble
i
had
neither
power
to
brave
him
and
speak
with
her
nor
attempt
conciliating
him
by
withdrawing
my
hand
from
her
in
a
much
less
angry
tone
although
she
had
been
so
much
more
bold
than
he
had
used
to
me
valmont
said
are
strangely
presumptuous
child
have
i
not
told
you
i
have
other
designs
have
i
not
a
right
over
you
you
have
none
replied
sibella
abruptly
right
to
the
exercise
of
an
unjust
power
over
me
why
dream
of
impossibilities
and
talk
of
other
designs
i
tell
you
sir
i
have
looked
on
every
side
and
i
find
it
is
your
caprice
and
no
principle
of
reason
in
you
that
forbids
our
union
had
you
seen
him
arthur
you
could
alone
judge
of
the
rage
into
which
this
daring
speech
threw
valmont
he
sprang
up
caprice
he
vociferated
and
after
bestowing
on
sibella
an
execration
he
rushed
past
us
out
of
the
library
sibella
neither
abashed
nor
terrified
would
have
me
go
with
her
into
the
park
but
i
dared
not
fearing
that
valmont
might
think
i
joined
in
braving
him
if
he
saw
us
together
i
endeavoured
to
persuade
her
it
was
necessary
i
should
remain
in
the
library
and
proper
that
she
should
leave
me
the
lovely
romantic
girl
called
me
weakly
timid
and
left
me
somewhat
displeased
i
sat
out
the
time
of
valmont
absence
from
the
library
full
two
hours
arthur
when
he
came
in
he
said
sir
i
shall
have
occasion
for
you
by
and
by
so
much
prudence
had
i
that
i
did
not
go
near
sibella
but
shut
myself
for
the
rest
of
the
day
in
my
chamber
and
sent
her
word
it
was
by
valmont
order
my
servant
found
her
weeping
with
her
little
favourite
fawn
in
her
arms
at
six
in
the
evening
i
was
again
commanded
to
appear
before
valmont
which
i
did
with
the
most
humble
and
submissive
deportment
i
could
possibly
assume
before
he
spoke
to
me
he
ordered
andrew
to
stand
without
the
door
to
oppose
sibella
if
she
attempted
to
enter
the
library
thus
he
began
did
i
expect
clement
when
i
sent
you
from
valmont
castle
guarded
by
the
lessons
of
my
wisdom
and
experience
that
you
would
return
with
inclinations
so
different
to
those
i
would
have
had
you
possess
your
folly
is
excessive
and
it
will
work
its
own
punishment
and
on
this
theme
he
laboured
most
abundantly
it
would
weary
you
were
i
to
repeat
it
all
the
second
part
of
his
subject
commenced
thus
know
young
man
i
am
young
man
now
arthur
that
i
have
been
a
friend
to
you
a
more
than
common
friend
such
a
one
as
you
will
not
readily
find
among
those
people
you
admire
with
equal
mischief
to
yourself
and
ingratitude
to
me
you
pshaw
i
have
not
patience
to
recount
the
dull
monotony
of
his
charges
let
me
at
once
proceed
to
the
distracting
summing
up
of
the
whole
he
told
me
arthur
that
he
was
about
to
send
me
again
from
valmont
castle
ay
but
how
not
with
affluence
at
my
command
and
honours
in
my
possession
no
like
a
poor
discarded
wretch
condemned
to
disgrace
and
slavery
yes
by
heaven
valmont
with
a
brow
and
heart
of
marble
told
me
he
had
determined
as
the
best
means
of
promoting
my
happiness
that
i
should
go
to
london
and
there
choose
for
myself
a
profession
hereafter
to
live
by
it
and
that
his
friendship
and
assistance
would
always
be
mine
according
to
the
decency
and
propriety
of
my
deportment
i
thought
i
should
have
sunk
upon
the
floor
arthur
the
barbarian
went
on
to
torture
me
in
my
castle
you
remain
but
one
month
from
this
day
and
then
i
shall
give
you
which
will
be
sufficient
for
you
while
you
prepare
your
plans
and
what
future
services
you
require
must
be
regulated
by
your
deserts
young
man
think
continued
valmont
is
my
lot
to
receive
nothing
but
disobedience
and
ingratitude
from
those
to
whom
i
have
shown
most
kindness
you
heard
the
insolence
with
which
sibella
dared
to
arraign
my
conduct
tell
her
from
me
clement
that
she
almost
urged
me
to
counteract
the
great
good
i
intend
her
but
i
will
not
be
rash
tell
her
that
implicit
obedience
and
humble
submission
may
expiate
her
offence
i
declare
solemnly
that
if
she
dares
enter
into
my
presence
to
plead
for
you
while
you
stay
in
the
castle
she
shall
that
instant
be
confined
close
prisoner
in
her
chamber
and
shall
see
you
no
more
if
she
becomes
modest
temperate
and
submissive
and
things
turn
out
as
i
expect
she
will
live
yet
to
be
very
happy
with
the
husband
i
intend
her
much
longer
did
he
enlarge
upon
sibella
offence
his
anger
her
expected
penitence
and
his
future
designs
for
her
i
heard
him
but
imperfectly
the
other
part
of
his
harangue
had
conjured
up
a
horrible
fiend
poverty
glared
before
me
at
length
he
stumbled
on
a
supposition
that
sibella
would
attempt
to
leave
the
castle
with
me
and
i
readily
promised
as
he
desired
that
i
would
neither
make
nor
assist
in
the
attempt
but
would
inform
him
if
she
resolved
on
so
dangerous
and
mad
an
enterprise
not
one
consolating
hint
did
my
ready
obedience
purchase
he
said
indeed
that
the
propriety
of
my
present
deportment
merited
commendation
and
he
dismissed
me
after
four
hours
of
this
cruel
interviews
duration
he
permitted
me
to
stagger
sick
oppressed
drooping
dying
to
my
chamber
and
seek
rest
if
i
could
find
it
i
number
the
moments
with
more
exactness
than
the
sands
of
an
one
month
is
wasted
now
to
one
fortnight
and
the
end
of
that
fortnight
is
wretchedness
certain
and
endless
i
have
not
told
sibella
yet
she
sees
misery
in
my
looks
she
hears
it
in
my
sighs
and
the
contagion
has
reached
her
we
meet
but
seldom
complaint
and
remonstrance
have
usurped
the
place
of
transport
and
endearment
to
her
i
attribute
my
sorrows
to
my
jealousy
of
this
rival
to
whom
valmont
dooms
her
alas
my
jealousy
has
but
a
small
share
in
them
two
years
back
but
to
have
dreamed
another
had
gained
possession
of
her
charms
would
have
driven
me
mad
now
i
know
it
an
inevitable
certainty
and
my
feeble
jealousy
has
none
of
the
fierce
characteristics
of
that
raging
passion
no
it
is
just
fitting
the
groveling
lover
who
is
condemned
to
earn
his
abject
livelihood
she
has
seen
him
too
valmont
in
his
own
inexplicable
way
has
contrived
two
whimsical
meetings
for
them
she
does
not
conjecture
this
having
related
the
circumstance
it
is
removed
from
her
thoughts
and
she
mourns
my
supposed
jealousy
as
a
cruel
misfortune
my
impending
fate
she
must
know
sooner
or
later
and
this
very
morning
when
she
quits
her
apartments
to
go
to
the
wood
i
am
resolved
to
follow
and
tell
her
my
despair
perhaps
she
will
join
in
seeming
to
renounce
me
and
thus
so
far
conciliate
valmont
that
some
pity
may
arise
for
me
in
his
obdurate
breast
you
arthur
may
perhaps
be
as
insensible
to
the
calamities
of
your
friend
as
you
have
hitherto
appeared
to
his
pleasures
i
have
seen
some
letters
that
speak
of
you
and
by
them
i
learn
you
are
not
less
inexplicable
to
others
than
to
me
who
is
this
miss
ashburn
that
sibella
rapturously
speaks
of
i
think
i
should
not
like
her
she
appears
to
have
ideas
i
wonder
valmont
should
have
suffered
her
and
sibella
intercourse
are
you
murden
in
love
with
this
lady
answer
me
these
questions
and
above
all
assure
me
that
you
will
not
breathe
a
whisper
of
this
change
in
my
affairs
to
any
living
creature
sibella
this
instant
crosses
the
lawn
i
depart
on
my
desperate
errand
i
have
performed
my
task
and
gained
nothing
by
it
no
nothing
she
will
not
cruel
as
she
is
she
will
not
soothe
valmont
by
pretending
to
renounce
me
by
heaven
i
do
not
believe
she
loves
me
scarcely
did
she
betray
a
particle
of
surprise
not
one
of
grief
when
i
declared
myself
disinherited
i
expected
to
have
seen
her
frantic
well
then
it
is
all
at
an
end
ay
ay
she
is
wise
she
talks
of
love
to
amuse
me
and
already
prepares
to
yield
herself
to
the
wealthy
lover
valmont
provides
oh
distraction
they
will
live
in
splendor
and
happiness
while
i
an
outcast
the
contemned
unpitied
and
forgotten
farewel
would
i
could
say
for
ever
clement
montgomery
letter
xiv
from
sibella
valmont
to
caroline
ashburn
why
in
that
moment
should
i
turn
coward
and
rush
from
my
purposes
why
did
imagination
cast
an
unusual
gloom
around
me
why
did
i
sigh
and
tremble
such
alone
ought
to
be
the
emotions
of
a
guilty
mind
and
surely
i
am
blameless
i
am
about
to
do
nothing
rash
i
obey
no
impulse
of
passion
i
have
not
separated
duty
and
pleasure
i
have
examined
the
value
of
the
object
i
would
obtain
with
calmness
and
whatever
view
i
take
of
the
means
still
duty
points
to
the
part
i
have
chosen
oh
caroline
could
i
once
have
imagined
that
i
should
require
hours
to
deliberate
whether
i
ought
to
become
the
bride
of
clement
no
longer
the
animated
noble
clement
whose
love
the
very
essence
of
his
existence
soared
beyond
murmurs
jealousies
and
fears
whose
eye
ever
spoke
the
fulness
of
content
he
is
now
wan
desponding
as
ardent
yet
less
chaste
misled
by
the
wild
creations
of
his
distempered
fancy
ashamed
of
poverty
brooding
over
imaginary
evils
over
doubts
fears
jealousies
what
a
dark
and
fatal
cloud
must
have
overspread
the
mind
of
clement
ere
he
could
fear
sibella
for
her
love
is
not
a
mutable
passion
it
is
incorporate
with
her
nature
my
love
and
reason
have
become
one
my
fancy
only
subservient
to
its
predominant
command
clement
still
loves
and
i
know
he
would
view
the
fairest
beauty
the
brightest
grace
with
an
unmoved
look
with
an
unpalpitating
heart
for
who
that
loved
could
be
faithless
but
is
this
cold
this
cruel
uncle
has
done
it
all
he
heaps
secret
on
secret
uncertainty
on
uncertainty
till
the
poor
youth
bewildered
surrounded
overwhelmed
sinks
the
victim
of
conjecture
he
is
no
longer
valmont
heir
and
he
shudders
at
the
prospect
of
earning
his
future
subsistence
valmont
tells
him
we
shall
not
be
united
and
forgetting
that
we
are
not
the
puppets
of
his
power
even
this
useless
threat
clement
loads
with
terror
another
separation
too
is
about
to
take
place
and
he
has
not
once
looked
forward
to
the
hour
when
we
shall
wash
away
the
remembrance
in
tears
of
joy
at
our
and
shall
i
be
content
merely
to
deplore
my
former
clement
giving
nothing
to
restore
him
oh
no
i
had
written
to
him
i
had
even
ascended
the
stairs
to
his
apartment
when
a
sudden
terror
seized
upon
me
i
hastily
hid
the
billet
from
my
view
and
with
the
restlessness
of
an
anxious
mind
first
sought
the
wood
and
then
my
chamber
the
billet
lies
before
me
i
have
examined
its
purport
it
calls
on
clement
to
become
my
husband
for
ought
i
to
withhold
myself
from
giving
him
the
fullest
proof
of
my
affection
from
renovating
him
by
this
proof
because
valmont
cruelly
commands
it
surely
i
ought
not
valmont
presence
and
benediction
might
adorn
with
one
more
smile
the
nuptial
hour
but
is
our
hearts
alone
that
can
bind
the
vow
if
clement
is
not
in
unison
with
mine
if
he
feels
the
necessity
of
other
ties
he
will
refuse
the
offer
and
point
out
to
me
that
i
have
erred
my
courage
rises
the
paleness
of
fear
on
my
cheek
gives
way
to
the
glow
of
hope
i
shall
forget
that
absence
misfortune
and
pain
have
intervened
and
live
over
again
those
hours
of
joy
and
peace
when
our
bosoms
heaved
no
sigh
save
the
rich
sigh
of
transport
and
confidence
i
go
and
will
i
though
now
forbidden
his
presence
go
to
my
uncle
and
conjure
him
to
convince
himself
that
power
and
command
are
useless
when
reason
and
conviction
oppose
them
adieu
sibella
valmont
letter
xv
from
clement
montgomery
to
arthur
murden
read
the
inclosed
dear
arthur
and
imagine
my
sudden
transition
from
despair
to
rapture
i
was
sitting
mute
in
anguish
when
the
divine
form
of
my
sibella
appeared
at
my
chamber
door
she
held
to
me
a
paper
and
as
i
took
it
she
turned
away
sighing
deeply
read
read
i
say
and
partake
if
you
can
my
feelings
but
though
i
tell
you
i
have
just
arisen
from
her
arms
with
your
cold
killing
indifference
it
is
impossible
you
can
form
the
shadow
of
a
resemblance
to
those
transports
which
wrap
my
senses
in
delirium
did
you
think
i
had
not
dared
to
follow
o
yes
it
was
not
to
face
the
stern
valmont
no
it
was
in
secret
to
receive
sibella
to
my
arms
whom
i
love
more
than
life
it
was
to
outplot
valmont
to
enjoy
a
glorious
though
secret
triumph
over
this
rival
this
chosen
this
elected
of
valmont
favour
how
could
i
with
youth
glowing
in
my
veins
love
throbbing
in
my
heart
reject
the
tempting
offer
though
multitudes
of
dangers
threatened
at
a
distance
avaunt
ye
dark
forebodings
ye
gloomy
horrors
assail
not
now
the
enraptured
clement
the
hours
can
not
move
backwards
the
deed
can
not
be
undone
the
moon
and
stars
shone
sole
witnesses
of
our
contract
but
read
murden
write
to
me
instantly
and
say
you
have
for
once
warmed
yourself
into
delight
to
find
something
like
the
state
of
clement
montgomery
exquisite
but
misjudging
charmer
she
would
have
told
valmont
that
she
had
given
herself
to
me
my
arms
my
prayers
could
hardly
restrain
her
from
her
wild
purpose
billet
from
sibella
to
clement
in
the
preceding
when
i
would
speak
i
weep
new
feelings
new
ideas
agitate
my
mind
a
tremor
that
i
can
not
banish
gives
confusion
to
my
thoughts
and
all
i
now
wish
to
express
should
be
regular
forcible
once
had
my
heart
conceived
the
design
with
which
it
now
vibrates
under
a
weight
of
apprehensions
it
had
been
uttered
without
preparation
but
you
are
not
the
same
valmont
mysteries
have
acted
on
you
in
their
full
effect
you
teach
your
brow
caution
you
learn
concealments
you
fear
rivals
rivals
in
sibella
love
oh
no
no
no
but
force
you
say
valmont
power
ah
clement
clement
turn
your
thoughts
back
and
find
its
importance
but
you
can
not
dread
has
seized
up
on
you
and
valmont
heightens
the
threatened
evil
till
it
appears
already
arrived
it
overwhelms
you
with
its
terrors
and
there
is
nought
left
to
sibella
but
remembrance
to
paint
her
clement
let
valmont
dismiss
you
that
bears
not
the
semblance
of
misfortune
but
you
shall
not
go
to
have
your
efforts
chained
down
by
despair
your
vigour
shall
not
be
impaired
by
corroding
doubts
when
you
seek
delight
you
shall
remember
your
love
and
the
present
short
absence
shall
be
the
only
pang
her
idea
can
inflict
come
to
my
apartments
with
pure
hearts
and
hands
we
will
plight
our
fervent
unspotted
faith
say
i
am
your
and
you
are
mine
and
sorrow
and
jealousy
will
vanish
as
a
mist
you
shall
go

transported

to
clement

sir
your
letters
one
and
all
i
suppose
have
come
in
safety
to
my
hands
in
your
last
you
are
urgent
for
my
answer
it
is
this
although
you
montgomery
amuse
your
spleen
or
your
fancy
by
talking
of
my
killing
i
have
such
as
tell
me
your
conduct
is
neither
that
of
a
lover
nor
a
man
farewel
sir
i
renounce
your
friendship
i
desire
only
to
remain
a
stranger
to
your
name
and
remembrance
arthur

letter
xvii
from
arthur
murden
to
clement
montgomery
montgomery
call
me
mad
possessed
curse
me
reproach
me
do
anything
only
that
when
you
have
had
your
revenge
forget
such
a
letter
as
i
wrote
you
last
ever
had
existence
say
it
was
strange
i
say
so
too
call
it
insolent
i
will
confess
it
unaccountable
i
still
join
with
you
it
was
one
of
the
sudden
whirls
of
this
vertigo
brain
of
mine
almost
as
incomprehensible
to
myself
as
to
you
i
have
no
excuses
to
offer
for
the
fit
may
come
again
upon
me
promise
has
no
power
with
me
i
am
the
creature
of
impulse
alas
alas
that
reason
and
consistency
should
thus
become
the
shuttlecocks
of
fancy
now
taking
it
for
granted
that
i
gain
your
pardon
next
have
i
a
long
account
to
settle
with
myself
i
would
not
partake
of
happiness
of
a
common
mould
lay
it
before
me
and
i
disdained
the
petty
prize
stalked
proudly
over
it
and
stalked
on
prying
and
watching
to
seize
hold
on
some
hidden
blessing
that
reserved
itself
to
be
the
reward
of
a
deserving
venturous
hero
like
myself
oh
i
have
embraced
a
cloud
and
the
tormenting
wheel
rolls
round
with
a
rapid
motion
i
know
i
am
talking
algebra
to
you
and
if
you
take
me
for
a
companion
you
must
even
be
content
to
travel
on
in
the
dark
it
is
so
but
why
it
is
i
think
your
best
discernment
will
not
aid
you
to
discover
enquiry
is
useless
expostulation
a
farce
be
patient
and
forgive
me
this
and
other
transgressions
for
i
tell
you
montgomery
you
have
a
potent
revenge
there
is
little
probability
that
you
and
i
should
meet
each
other
as
london
will
be
the
scene
of
your
action
while
i
condemn
myself
to
wander
north
and
south
in
search
of
a
few
grains
of
that
content
i
so
wantonly
gave
the
winds
to
scatter
i
must
have
room
to
vent
my
suffocating
thoughts
i
can
not
be
pinioned
in
the
crowd
and
i
would
rather
seek
converse
with
myself
in
a
charnel
house
than
enter
the
brightest
circles
of
fashion
i
hate
to
be
the
wonder
of
fools
already
is
my
reputation
raised
and
i
have
now
just
sense
enough
in
madness
to
play
my
antics
alone
driven
by
winds
and
storms
i
may
seek
an
occasional
shelter
at
barlowe
hall
whither
if
you
are
so
disposed
you
may
direct
to
arthur
murden
i
believe
montgomery
it
is
necessary
that
i
say
something
more
to
you
the
above
conclusion
is
abrupt
and
harsh
that
i
feel
inclined
to
treat
you
thus
is
the
consequence
of
my
own
folly
rather
than
your
deservings
of
me
let
it
pass
then
i
wish
you
no
ill
but
as
i
told
you
before
i
am
become
the
tool
of
every
changing
impulse
i
sympathize
in
your
change
of
fortune
or
rather
i
feel
a
concern
that
you
should
colour
with
such
darkened
hues
so
unimportant
a
circumstance
i
too
have
counted
upon
heirship
but
let
my
uncle
the
nabob
put
five
hundred
pound
in
my
pocket
and
set
me
down
in
london
petersburg
or
pekin
and
if
i
did
not
walk
my
own
pace
through
the
world
let
me
die
like
a
dog
and
have
no
better
burial
five
hundred
pound
is
a
mine
ah
sigh
not
to
be
foremost
of
the
throng
independence
peace
and
self
approving
reflection
may
be
if
you
will
the
companions
of
your
new
destiny
certainly
valmont
managed
his
plan
of
making
you
a
hermit
with
wonderful
ingenuity
to
send
you
forth
from
your
cave
at
that
very
age
when
the
fancy
runs
gadding
after
novelty
and
shadow
passes
for
substance
he
decked
you
too
with
the
trappings
of
wealth
and
expected
every
man
to
appear
before
you
with
a
label
written
on
his
forehead
of
his
souls
most
secret
he
had
better
have
driven
you
out
to
beg
with
an
empty
wallet
and
then
perhaps
when
one
had
said
another
had
hinted
and
a
third
had
passed
you
and
said
nothing
you
might
possibly
have
returned
to
a
leopard
skin
and
a
hut
of
branches
the
man
after
valmont
own
heart
be
wiser
and
happier
montgomery
than
this
man
has
been
shun
his
weaknesses
and
your
own
you
also
have
your
portion
of
weaknesses
follies
vices
yes
montgomery
the
latter
word
is
not
too
harsh
or
i
should
not
have
had
now
to
pity
you
for
being
duped
by
the
contemptible
janetta
l
other
instances
there
are
for
me
to
cite
they
press
upon
my
feelings
they
wound
they
torture
me
judge
for
yourself
montgomery
upon
the
right
and
wrong
of
your
conduct
and
intentions
i
am
ill
fitted
to
become
your
adviser
how
could
you
so
far
mistake
my
character
as
to
suppose
i
was
the
seducer
of
seymour
mistress
i
think
one
of
your
letters
asserted
so
much
if
to
persuade
a
deceived
girl
to
quit
her
profligate
companion
i
will
not
say
lover
i
should
disgrace
the
name
and
return
to
console
the
latter
days
of
an
aged
grandmother
be
seduction
i
am
guilty
this
i
did
to
seymour
and
his
invectives
or
the
rumours
he
may
spread
are
as
unimportant
and
as
little
troublesome
to
my
repose
as
the
insects
that
are
buzzing
around
me
montgomery
no
more
of
your
phrases
nor
his
accusations
be
assured
i
am
neither
your
marble
nor
seymour
at
a
boyish
age
from
boyish
vanity
i
aimed
to
be
called
a
man
of
pleasure
it
was
easy
to
imitate
the
air
and
manners
of
such
a
man
and
not
less
by
such
imitation
alone
to
arrive
at
the
contemptible
fame
among
persons
equally
ready
to
encourage
the
practice
and
accuse
the
practitioner
i
renounce
the
loathsome
labours
of
the
flatterers
the
despicable
renown
of
the
libertine
miss
ashburn
is
my
monitress
she
began
her
lessons
at
barlowe
hall
and
now
continues
the
instruction
at
bath
do
not
imagine
it
was
done
in
devout
lectures
or
pious
declamations
no
it
was
the
stedfast
modesty
of
her
eye
her
intelligent
condemning
mien
which
said
here
shall
thy
proud
boast
be
stayed
she
was
the
finest
woman
of
our
party
and
all
the
rest
prepared
to
meet
me
with
the
glance
of
approbations
and
the
smile
of
encouragement
yet
she
having
been
forewarned
of
my
renown
preferred
the
hand
or
arm
or
speech
of
a
silly
old
colonel
of
now
she
knows
me
better
no
she
does
not
i
evade
i
fly
her
penetration
montgomery
the
worthiest
feeling
i
know
of
you
is
that
you
lament
your
having
made
your
truth
and
innocence
a
sacrifice
i
am
not
in
love
with
miss
ashburn
i
would
give
an
ear
an
eye
any
thing
i
have
on
earth
except
the
full
confidence
of
my
heart
to
call
her
my
sister
my

seek
venerate

volume
ii
letter
i
from
caroline
ashburn
to
sibella
valmont
i
have
not
answered
your
letter
my
dear
sibella
as
soon
as
you
perhaps
may
have
expected
because
i
was
willing
to
dwell
on
the
circumstances
it
contained
till
the
minutest
shade
was
present
with
me
and
till
i
discovered
exactly
wherein
to
praise
or
wherein
to
blame
the
time
i
have
taken
to
deliberate
has
not
been
thrown
away
for
it
has
excited
ideas
in
my
mind
that
may
prove
of
infinite
service
to
us
both
and
should
i
in
future
find
aught
to
add
or
diminish
from
my
sentiments
i
shall
offer
it
as
frankly
as
i
now
do
my
present
decision
sibella
well
might
you
even
at
the
door
of
clement
apartment
retreat
from
your
enterprise
for
then
at
that
moment
you
wandered
the
first
step
from
your
rectitude
and
had
you
instead
of
sitting
down
to
detail
your
reasons
to
me
enquired
narrowly
into
the
cause
of
your
sensations
you
must
have
discovered
that
error
was
creeping
in
upon
you
and
that
your
native
frankness
and
stedfast
sincerity
were
making
a
vigorous
effort
to
repel
that
of
virtue
have
you
forgotten
my
sibella
when
you
said
am
not
weak
enough
to
descend
to
artifice
did
i
believe
it
right
to
go
i
should
go
openly
then
might
he
try
his
opposing
strength
but
he
would
find
that
i
could
leap
swim
or
dive
and
that
walls
or
moats
are
feeble
barriers
to
a
determined
will
this
was
noble
and
i
promised
myself
that
in
you
i
should
find
the
one
rare
instance
wherein
no
temptation
could
incline
or
terror
affright
into
any
species
of
concealment
i
grant
nothing
could
bring
the
temptation
more
strongly
forward
than
the
state
into
which
clement
and
you
were
forced
but
still
you
should
have
resisted
your
every
thought
should
still
have
flown
to
your
lips
your
every
intention
should
have
been
as
public
to
those
by
whom
you
were
surrounded
as
to
yourself
no
matter
though
it
should
dash
aside
a
present
project
be
openly
firm
in
the
resolution
to
do
right
and
my
life
for
it
the
opposition
of
mistake
and
prejudice
will
bear
no
proportion
in
strength
to
your
perseverance
it
is
evident
that
this
plain
and
necessary
truth
mixed
itself
with
your
ideas
although
the
tumults
of
hope
and
fear
and
the
crowd
of
images
that
were
then
rushing
on
your
mind
dazzled
your
perception
for
you
saw
it
in
part
when
you
resolved
to
declare
to
valmont
in
the
morning
all
that
you
had
done
would
you
had
previously
declared
it
i
know
how
useless
it
is
to
wish
over
the
past
yet
i
must
again
say
would
you
had
previously
declared
it
you
pause
sibella
you
are
convinced
but
you
instantaneously
quit
the
regret
of
that
error
for
selfcongratulation
i
can
enter
into
all
your
feelings
and
i
find
you
now
dwelling
with
pleasure
on
the
supposition
that
i
condemn
only
the
concealment
that
i
look
on
the
contract
itself
as
an
act
of
justice
and
that
i
am
about
to
applaud
you
for
the
fulfillment
of
a
duty
and
herein
it
is
that
i
have
doubted
to
this
one
point
have
i
called
every
present
and
remote
circumstance
and
it
is
from
the
combination
of
circumstances
alone
that
i
have
been
able
to
decide
the
distinction
becomes
nice
between
praise
and
blame
for
i
have
both
to
offer
yet
if
i
judge
aright
some
praise
belongs
to
you
to
the
blame
valmont
has
an
incontestible
title
with
such
an
education
as
he
has
given
you
unless
you
had
been
a
mere
block
without
ideas
it
was
impossible
you
should
not
become
a
romantic
enthusiast
in
whatever
species
of
passion
first
engaged
your
feelings
and
valmont
took
care
to
make
that
first
passion
whatever
cause
can
have
led
him
to
his
present
inconsistency
it
is
as
evident
to
me
as
light
and
sensation
that
it
was
his
settled
plan
to
render
love
for
each
other
the
ruling
feature
of
your
and
clement
character
the
contrivance
was
worthless
but
the
performance
was
admirable
thus
you
and
clement
loved
from
habit
youth
is
always
ardent
and
lively
it
inclines
to
fondness
and
you
had
none
of
the
constraints
which
society
lays
on
the
first
expansions
of
tenderness
you
had
no
claimants
from
kindred
or
family
on
your
affections
for
the
forbidding
valmont
excited
only
fear
and
you
sought
shelter
in
each
other
arms
from
the
terrors
of
his
frown
it
was
not
more
natural
to
breathe
than
to
love
it
was
not
more
natural
to
love
than
to
obey
its
dictates
thus
you
and
clement
secluded
from
the
world
with
your
every
pleasure
arising
only
from
mutual
efforts
to
please
could
not
fail
to
love
from
habit
had
clement
and
you
been
educated
in
the
world
clement
would
still
have
loved
from
habit
because
i
suspect
he
possesses
more
of
softness
than
of
strength
he
would
have
loved
often
and
it
would
have
been
a
trivial
love
neither
arising
to
any
height
nor
directed
by
any
excellence
you
sibella
would
have
loved
from
reflection
from
a
more
intimate
knowledge
of
increasing
virtues
from
the
intercourse
of
mind
then
call
it
friendship
or
call
it
love
it
would
indeed
possess
those
predominant
and
absorbing
qualities
you
describe
and
which
you
now
feel
but
sibella
depend
on
it
clement
had
never
been
the
object
pardon
me
i
do
not
mean
to
wound
you
i
know
you
will
not
shrink
from
truth
and
i
must
therefore
tell
you
that
the
alteration
in
clement
which
you
ascribe
wholly
to
valmont
mysteries
i
ascribe
to
feebleness
of
character
wherever
your
rises
to
superiority
his
sinks
had
he
been
equal
and
had
there
been
no
secresy
in
the
case
i
would
have
hailed
your
i
well
know
my
friend
that
you
did
not
mean
to
separate
duty
and
pleasure
motives
the
most
chaste
and
holy
guided
you
no
forms
or
ceremonies
could
add
an
atom
to
your
purity
or
make
your
in
the
sight
of
heaven
more
a
marriage
yet
do
i
wish
with
all
the
fervency
of
my
soul
this
marriage
had
been
deferred
that
you
had
previously
informed
valmont
is
past
and
repentance
is
only
of
value
as
it
guides
us
in
our
future
actions
we
must
endeavour
to
rouse
clement
from
his
inactivity
i
do
believe
he
is
not
vicious
though
your
uncle
conduct
respecting
him
has
the
worst
of
tendencies
my
sibella
excellence
must
have
placed
a
talisman
around
him
from
which
vice
retires
hopeless
of
influence
this
is
one
great
step
and
as
i
understand
from
murden
he
is
to
be
in
london
i
will
seek
his
friendship
give
a
spur
to
every
lurking
talent
endeavour
to
preserve
him
free
from
taint
and
if
i
had
judged
too
hastily
if
he
is
beyond
what
i
expect
with
what
delight
shall
i
contemplate
the
merits
of
him
whose
fate
you
have
interwoven
with
your
own
ah
how
close
is
the
texture
with
what
firmness
can
you
think
to
what
excess
can
you
love
the
dark
season
of
the
year
is
arrived
the
fashionable
world
haste
to
the
capital
we
are
never
hindmost
of
the
throng
yet
this
once
have
i
urged
forward
our
removal
to
london
with
all
my
influence
for
i
apprehend
the
succession
of
its
gay
diversions
and
the
multiplicity
of
varied
engagements
which
must
then
occupy
my
mother
will
remove
from
her
mind
any
inclination
towards
a
second
marriage
here
opportunity
is
always
at
hand
for
that
despicable
race
of
young
men
who
are
ever
on
the
watch
to
sell
their
persons
and
liberty
to
the
highest
bidder
and
as
ashburn
immensity
of
wealth
is
the
general
topic
her
splendor
the
general
gaze
and
her
vanity
not
a
whit
more
concealed
from
observation
the
fortune
hunters
crowd
around
her
at
first
the
love
of
flattery
appeared
wholly
to
engage
her
and
each
was
acceptable
in
his
turn
till
at
length
the
elegant
person
of
one
youth
became
distinguished
in
a
manner
that
alarmed
me
not
but
i
should
rejoice
to
see
my
mother
yield
herself
to
the
guardianship
of
some
good
man
who
had
sense
enough
to
advise
and
resolution
to
restrain
her
lavish
follies
of
such
an
union
i
have
not
any
hope
and
i
must
if
possible
prevent
her
being
the
dupe
and
victim
of
a
misguided
choice
this
young
man
possessed
in
a
very
emminent
degree
the
advantages
of
person
air
and
address
yet
when
he
directed
his
attentions
wholly
towards
ashburn
there
was
such
evident
constraint
in
his
manner
and
his
professions
were
so
laboured
that
almost
any
other
woman
would
have
condemned
him
ashburn
did
not
she
received
she
encouraged
him
she
led
him
into
every
circle
in
open
triumph
as
her
devoted
lover
while
his
forced
levity
at
one
time
and
at
another
his
pale
cheek
absence
of
mind
and
half
uttered
sighs
told
to
every
observer
that
he
was
a
sacrifice
but
not
a
lover
i
could
not
believe
that
the
affair
would
ever
be
brought
to
so
absurd
a
conclusion
till
i
found
that
the
day
of
marriage
was
actually
fixed
on
i
ought
to
have
interfered
before
for
my
interference
has
now
saved
them
from
the
commission
of
such
a
folly
i
must
sibella
reserve
the
history
of
this
young
man
till
another
letter
i
am
called
from
the
pleasing
occupation
of
writing
to
you
by
an
engagement
with
a
being
more
variable
more
inexplicable
than
any
being
within
my
knowledge
yet
to
me
not
less
interesting
than
any
i
mean
murden
never
need
i
be
wearied
with
the
sameness
of
my
thoughts
while
i
reside
under
one
roof
with
murden
for
let
me
turn
them
on
the
caprices
of
his
conduct
and
i
shall
find
puzzling
varieties
without
end
ever
caroline
ashburn
letter
ii
the
same
to
the
same
henry
davenport
is
the
young
man
of
whom
i
am
to
speak
it
was
publicly
mentioned
here
that
he
was
related
to
several
noble
families
and
at
the
same
time
was
always
hinted
that
he
possessed
no
fortune
this
i
was
ready
to
believe
from
his
addressing
my
mother
constantly
surrounded
with
parties
and
studious
to
avoid
me
it
was
useless
to
attempt
reasoning
with
my
mother
i
therefore
wrote
a
card
to
davenport
requesting
an
hour
conversation
with
him
the
succeeding
morning
he
came
he
was
light
and
gay
in
his
habit
and
address
his
voice
possessed
an
unusual
softness
and
his
cheek
was
flushed
with
an
hectic
colour
equally
proceeding
i
thought
from
want
of
rest
and
intemperance
davenport
said
i
interrupting
his
compliments
will
convince
me
most
that
you
are
pleased
with
this
interview
by
answering
the
questions
i
shall
propose
with
seriousness
and
sincerity
he
folded
his
hands
and
ludicrously
lengthened
his
visage
but
of
this
i
took
no
notice
me
continued
i
and
truly
what
is
your
opinion
of
my
mother
his
levity
instantly
disappeared
and
he
replied
in
a
hurrying
manner
think
ashburn
a
very
charming
a
very
fine
woman
indeed
are
your
motives
sir
for
marrying
her
ashburn
said
he
with
great
quickness
and
removing
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
to
a
chair
next
me
do
respect
and
admire
you
as
much
or
perhaps
more
than
any
woman
on
the
face
of
the
earth
i
would
eat
my
flesh
rather
than
injure
you
and
if
ashburn
give
me
her
hand
i
swear
your
interest
in
her
fortune
shall
not
be
affected
i
do
not
wish
to
be
master
of
the
principal
i
only
want
to
share
some
of
that
income
which
is
lavished
on
o
god
o
god
how
happy
would
the
uncontrouled
independent
present
possession
of
some
of
those
hundreds
make
me
you
can
not
conceive
the
force
with
which
he
uttered
this
and
it
seemed
to
recal
a
world
of
pressing
ideas
to
his
mind
for
i
found
it
necessary
to
wait
till
his
attention
returned
of
itself
the
enjoyment
of
this
income
in
marriage
will
make
you
happy
year
after
year
all
your
life
mr
davenport
miss
ashburn
and
he
looked
at
me
stedfastly
can
not
think
i
would
ever
use
your
mother
you
love
her
sir
have
told
you
miss
ashburn
i
admire
her
i
think
her
a
fine
spirited
woman
you
love
her
sir
rejoined
i
with
more
emphasis
why
yes
no
i
have
a
great
friendship
for
her
but
as
to
love
is
out
of
fashion
it
is
exploded
he
rose
and
walked
towards
the
window
is
a
romance
a
cant
a
whine
a
delirium
a
poison
a
rankling
wound
that
festers
here
here
he
laid
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
leaned
against
the
wainscot
i
sighed
too
for
the
under
tone
of
voice
in
which
he
pronounced
the
last
few
words
was
in
scribably
affecting
he
quickly
started
from
this
posture
and
threw
himself
on
his
knees
before
me
confess
it
all
said
he
am
not
more
wretched
than
desperate
this
marriage
is
my
resource
from
worse
evils
oh
miss
ashburn
by
that
benignity
which
irradiates
your
every
action
i
conjure
you
suffer
it
to
proceed
i
will
be
i
will
honor
and
revere
your
more
i
can
not
promise
i
can
not
allow
me
to
depart
madam
i
can
not
endure
to
be
questioned
and
thus
saying
he
would
have
quitted
the
room
had
i
not
held
him
by
the
arm
and
with
difficulty
prevailed
on
him
again
to
take
his
seat
and
to
listen
to
me
patiently
while
i
pourtrayed
the
evils
of
such
a
marriage
and
the
cruel
injustice
he
was
guilty
of
towards
a
woman
so
chosen
know
all
that
replied
davenport
have
foreseen
it
a
thousand
and
a
thousand
times
i
know
i
am
a
villain
but
ashburn
shall
never
suspect
me
i
will
be
the
obedient
slave
of
her
will
she
shall
mould
me
to
whatever
shape
her
pleasure
inclines
i
will
be
more
docile
than
infancy
i
will
forego
my
very
nature
at
her
command
you
have
not
foreseen
davenport
that
the
time
must
arrive
when
her
volatility
and
incessant
eagerness
after
pleasure
will
cease
to
relieve
you
it
is
in
the
hours
of
age
and
infirmity
that
she
will
call
on
you
for
aid
will
seek
in
your
soothing
voice
in
your
cheering
smile
a
relief
from
pain
and
how
will
you
perform
your
task
in
those
multiplied
moments
my
mother
does
not
want
discernment
and
what
will
be
your
torture
to
see
her
dying
perhaps
under
the
agonizing
reflection
that
the
man
on
whose
honour
she
relied
on
whose
faith
and
sincerity
her
hopes
had
towered
to
felicity
that
her
husband
had
deceived
her
perhaps
had
loved
another
he
became
pale
as
death
i
continued
you
shall
not
hasten
to
this
destruction
i
will
prevent
this
marriage
ashburn
for
heaven
sake
cried
he
have
no
other
means
i
must
marry
i
took
hold
of
his
hand
for
he
trembled
wish
to
be
your
friend
davenport
indeed
i
am
your
friend
at
this
moment
it
is
far
from
my
intention
to
tear
from
you
this
fallacious
hope
without
placing
some
certain
and
honourable
advantage
in
its
stead
let
me
know
your
history
neither
conceal
from
me
your
wants
nor
your
feelings
nor
the
situations
they
have
throw
you
into
and
i
will
undertake
to
do
you
every
service
that
reason
and
humanity
suggest
he
attempted
in
vain
to
answer
throwing
himself
back
in
the
chair
he
covered
his
face
with
an
handkerchief
and
shed
tears
i
believe
it
was
near
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ere
he
recovered
from
his
agitation
and
was
able
to
speak
as
follows
father
was
himself
so
enamoured
of
pomp
that
although
he
allowed
me
an
only
son
to
share
the
magnificence
of
his
town
residence
yet
he
confined
my
sisters
with
their
governess
and
two
servants
to
a
small
house
he
possessed
in
a
cheap
country
i
saw
them
only
once
a
year
and
the
solitude
of
their
abode
was
so
irksome
to
me
that
i
was
always
eager
to
quit
and
unwilling
to
return
at
the
usual
period
however
about
the
time
i
was
to
set
out
on
my
travels
it
was
judged
decent
and
necessary
that
i
should
pay
them
a
visit
of
unusual
length
as
they
were
now
almost
women
and
to
my
great
surprise
i
found
their
old
governess
removed
and
a
young
person
with
them
as
companion
whom
alas
i
did
love
to
distraction
only
were
allotted
to
my
stay
but
i
staid
months
my
mandates
for
my
return
were
no
sooner
read
than
forgotten
all
was
enchantment
and
happiness
my
sisters
loved
arabella
affectionately
and
had
so
little
knowledge
of
the
world
as
to
imagine
our
union
altogether
proper
and
probable
at
length
either
surprised
or
alarmed
at
my
continuance
in
the
country
or
having
certain
intelligence
of
my
engagements
my
father
arrived
one
evening
secretly
and
altogether
unexpectedly
and
while
we
imagined
our
joys
secure
from
interruption
he
listened
behind
the
little
in
which
arabella
and
i
were
interchanging
vows
of
eternal
constancy
till
rage
would
not
permit
him
to
hear
us
longer
then
he
burst
upon
us
and
as
i
defended
my
love
with
vehemence
he
deprived
me
of
present
sensation
by
a
blow
i
recovered
i
was
confined
to
one
room
and
could
obtain
no
tidings
of
arabella
no
intercourse
with
my
sisters
nor
any
intermission
of
the
rigours
of
my
imprisonment
although
i
obstinately
refused
all
sustenance
beyond
the
small
quantity
which
irresistible
hunger
compelled
me
to
eat
against
my
will
in
three
weeks
one
of
my
sisters
found
an
expedient
to
let
me
know
arabella
had
been
turned
out
of
the
house
and
had
taken
shelter
at
the
of
a
relation
about
five
and
twenty
miles
distance
that
my
father
gave
her
the
character
of
an
abandoned
strumpet
and
vowed
i
should
die
in
prison
if
i
did
not
swear
to
renounce
her
for
ever
this
time
i
laboured
night
and
day
in
contriving
my
escape
till
i
effected
it
and
travelled
the
five
and
twenty
miles
with
such
speed
in
my
emaciated
state
that
i
had
no
sooner
thrown
myself
into
arms
than
i
fell
into
fits
a
fever
succeeded
and
during
this
period
the
people
of
the
house
though
excessively
poor
strove
with
all
their
might
to
add
comforts
and
conveniences
to
my
situation
arabella
was
my
nurse
to
them
i
was
bound
by
gratitude
to
her
my
ties
became
strengthened
till
they
excluded
reason
reflection
and
prudence
the
moments
of
returning
health
were
devoted
to
my
affection
our
days
were
passed
alone
our
former
distresses
and
future
prospects
were
alike
forgotten
and
we
became
as
guilty
as
happy
had
we
begun
to
repent
our
error
when
my
father
discovered
my
retreat
and
once
more
tore
me
from
my
love
guarded
fettered
and
enduring
every
species
of
brutal
usage
from
those
employed
about
me
i
was
conveyed
first
to
london
and
then
sent
abroad
where
i
remained
above
two
years
refusing
to
give
her
up
and
refused
upon
any
other
terms
to
be
allowed
to
return
my
father
death
gave
me
liberty
i
flew
to
england
and
found
my
arabella
pining
under
the
accumulated
distresses
of
extreme
poverty
destroyed
reputation
and
a
consumptive
habit
all
which
miseries
were
rendered
doubly
poignant
by
the
possession
of
an
infant
will
not
attempt
madam
to
describe
to
you
what
i
endured
when
i
saw
her
and
my
child
wanting
absolute
necessaries
all
i
could
call
my
own
was
employed
to
procure
medical
advice
for
arabella
and
that
all
was
a
trifle
my
father
to
the
astonishment
of
every
one
had
died
insolvent
my
sisters
were
taken
into
dependence
by
different
relations
and
i
was
turned
adrift
on
the
world
without
knowledge
or
means
to
procure
myself
one
penny
to
assist
those
who
have
no
power
to
assist
themselves
who
have
no
claims
but
on
me
me
the
author
of
their
calamity
i
have
plunged
myself
into
debt
the
man
of
whom
i
have
borrowed
money
pointed
out
to
me
the
plan
of
marrying
your
mother
and
when
i
revolted
at
the
dishonourable
action
he
showed
me
the
opposite
picture
a
what
can
i
do
miss
ashburn
can
i
see
them
die
and
consent
to
linger
out
my
wretched
existence
in
a
prison
no
i
am
driven
by
extremity
of
distress
and
must
go
on
or
perish
arabella
know
you
intend
to
marry
yes
is
she
may
i
see
her
and
her
child
reside
at
the
distance
of
three
miles
from
this
place
i
prevailed
on
davenport
to
ride
with
me
to
the
village
in
which
arabella
resided
and
after
introducing
me
to
her
i
also
prevailed
on
him
to
leave
us
alone
arabella
had
beside
her
a
tambour
frame
at
which
she
worked
when
her
cough
and
cold
sweats
would
permit
her
the
little
girl
played
on
the
floor
she
received
us
with
that
sort
of
composure
which
seemed
to
denote
the
utter
sacrifice
of
all
her
hopes
and
wishes
and
that
nothing
was
now
left
to
excite
agitation
i
said
am
no
stranger
to
your
misfortunes
arabella
in
what
manner
did
you
support
yourself
while
davenport
was
abroad
fancy
works
replied
she
pointing
to
the
frame
endeavoured
also
to
teach
a
school
but
davenport
father
had
spread
such
reports
of
me
which
the
birth
of
my
child
but
too
well
confirmed
that
scarce
any
one
would
give
me
the
least
encouragement
were
your
parents
shopkeepers
madam
who
put
themselves
to
numberless
inconveniences
to
qualify
me
for
earning
my
subsistence
in
a
comfortable
manner
could
i
regain
my
health
and
be
removed
to
some
place
where
no
one
knew
my
faults
davenport
should
not
be
burthened
with
either
of
us
he
should
not
a
tear
rose
but
quickly
withdrew
itself
and
the
serenity
of
a
broken
heart
again
took
possession
of
her
features
have
you
not
urged
davenport
to
engage
in
some
trade
or
profession
madam
he
has
been
brought
up
a
gentleman
trade
would
appear
to
him
an
indelible
disgrace
he
thinks
he
ought
to
respect
the
honour
of
his
family
although
they
will
not
assist
him
and
as
to
a
profession
he
has
not
the
means
can
you
consent
to
live
in
possession
of
his
affection
and
endearments
when
he
is
married
madam
no
replied
arabella
with
firmness
moment
he
becomes
a
husband
he
is
as
dead
to
me
as
if
the
cold
grave
concealed
him
he
loves
ease
he
has
been
used
to
expence
and
pleasure
he
will
enjoy
it
all
i
can
not
live
long
nor
do
i
desire
to
live
i
know
he
never
will
desert
that
poor
babe
do
you
madam
allow
that
innocent
creature
fully
entitled
to
a
father
protection
i
had
just
taken
the
child
on
my
lap
said
i
you
arabella
must
live
to
see
her
possess
it
my
motives
are
not
those
of
curiosity
i
come
to
do
you
service
and
i
insist
that
you
hope
for
better
days
it
shall
be
my
part
to
devise
better
means
than
marriage
for
davenport
i
intend
shortly
to
visit
you
again
i
could
not
converse
with
davenport
any
more
that
day
for
it
was
necessary
i
should
return
and
prepare
myself
to
be
partaker
of
a
very
splendid
entertainment
given
by
sir
thomas
barlowe
to
all
the
fashionable
people
at
bath
i
therefore
engaged
him
to
visit
me
again
the
next
morning
and
we
separated
making
mention
of
the
entertainment
brings
murden
to
my
remembrance
and
as
he
played
a
part
that
very
evening
which
attracted
much
notice
and
gave
rise
to
speculation
i
shall
here
relate
it
before
i
return
to
the
subject
of
davenport
ever
since
murden
joined
us
at
bath
i
have
heard
from
his
female
acquaintance
perpetual
complaints
of
him
he
was
they
say
seducing
irresistible
no
vivacity
was
ever
so
delicate
as
murden
no
flattery
ever
so
dangerous
as
from
him
his
look
his
air
his
voice
his
gestures
all
had
their
own
peculiar
character
of
persuasion
thus
captivating
they
say
he
was
and
they
lament
with
all
the
energy
of
which
they
are
capable
that
he
should
now
have
become
dull
lifeless
and
unbearable
i
too
sibella
have
found
him
transformed
i
see
him
negligent
and
inattentive
to
me
and
others
but
he
is
neither
dull
nor
lifeless
some
vision
of
imagination
seems
to
possess
him
to
infuse
into
him
as
it
were
a
new
existence
i
have
seen
his
cheek
glow
his
eye
beam
i
have
heard
his
breathings
but
half
uttered
and
although
at
such
moments
i
have
suffered
inconvenience
from
the
want
of
his
attention
and
assistance
i
would
rather
have
placed
my
safety
in
hazard
than
have
disturbed
his
alluring
dreams
of
fancy
so
firmly
has
he
become
inaccessible
to
the
temptations
of
dissipation
and
sensuality
that
i
revere
his
transformation
and
long
for
his
confidence
but
alas
i
have
to
regret
that
he
is
secret
and
mysterious
and
that
while
at
bath
he
has
avoided
me
almost
as
constantly
as
he
has
neglected
those
damsels
of
fashion
who
have
been
calling
forth
all
their
enchantments
to
attract
or
subdue
him
to
my
great
surprise
and
some
little
satisfaction
no
sooner
was
the
nabob
ball
in
preparation
than
murden
requested
to
be
my
partner
he
had
never
danced
here
though
he
had
been
frequently
at
the
rooms
and
i
did
expect
to
be
honoured
on
this
occasion
by
my
fair
friends
with
some
very
scornful
looks
and
important
hear
the
result
the
company
assembled
a
numerous
and
brilliant
party
i
had
caught
a
previous
glimpse
of
murden
elegantly
dressed
and
i
expected
every
moment
his
appearance
in
the
that
i
was
engaged
i
answered
to
several
invitations
but
to
whom
was
yet
in
embryo
for
the
first
second
third
and
fourth
minuet
had
been
danced
and
yet
no
partner
for
me
appeared
at
length
he
came
but
not
with
the
smile
of
pleasure
not
with
the
soft
tread
of
politeness
the
complacent
mien
of
attention
no
he
actually
rushed
upon
us
his
features
almost
distorted
with
some
species
of
passion
his
hair
deranged
and
the
powder
showered
on
his
dress
as
if
he
had
been
dashing
his
head
against
some
hard
substance
in
a
paroxysm
of
rage
and
in
this
strange
manner
did
he
with
eager
long
strides
cross
the
saloon
and
throw
himself
into
the
vacant
seat
beside
me
uttering
a
deep
groan
the
eyes
of
every
one
were
upon
him
and
astonishment
imposed
silence
on
every
tongue
ashburn
miss
ashburn
repeated
he
twice
very
loud
then
closed
his
teeth
and
murmured
through
them
some
words
i
could
not
understand
and
several
horrid
imprecations
he
sat
thus
a
few
minutes
his
countenance
varying
from
the
deepest
red
to
a
most
livid
paleness
when
sir
thomas
approached
nephew
why
arthur
what
what
are
you
ill
are
you
and
without
finishing
his
speech
the
baronet
retired
abruptly
for
murden
gnashing
his
teeth
at
that
instant
his
uncle
conceived
he
was
mad
and
i
believe
the
baronet
was
scarce
assured
he
had
escaped
the
infection
a
bolder
man
now
walked
up
no
less
than
the
earl
of
ulson
of
whom
you
have
heard
me
speak
my
soul
murden
this
is
superlatively
unusual
the
ladies
are
actually
terrified
zounds
murden
you
must
we
had
not
the
good
fortune
to
hear
his
lordship
advice
to
the
end
for
murden
utterly
inattentive
to
any
thing
but
his
own
agitations
now
snatched
a
crumpled
letter
from
his
pocket
and
tearing
it
into
a
thousand
pieces
dashed
the
fragments
on
the
floor
he
there
contemplated
them
a
moment
with
a
malignant
smile
then
carefully
gathered
up
every
fragment
and
darted
out
of
the
room
the
band
continued
playing
quite
composedly
but
the
company
assembled
in
separate
groups
to
communicate
their
various
conjectures
on
the
very
extraordinary
gambol
this
extraordinary
young
man
had
been
playing
sir
thomas
gentleman
and
a
valet
were
sent
in
search
of
him
and
ordered
to
enquire
into
his
malady
but
we
were
presently
informed
that
he
was
writing
in
his
own
chamber
and
had
bitterly
sworn
to
blow
out
the
brains
of
whatever
person
should
dare
to
interrupt
him
brains
not
being
a
superfluity
here
we
resolved
to
resume
our
dancing
and
leave
him
alone
to
be
as
mad
as
he
thought
proper
on
the
succeeding
morning
i
met
him
early
and
alone
in
the
breakfast
room
i
was
agitated
with
the
expectation
of
hearing
something
painful
and
astonishing
i
even
intreated
to
be
admitted
to
his
confidence
he
referred
me
to
some
future
period
he
spoke
with
calmness
and
resolution
but
he
seldom
looked
up
when
the
rest
of
the
family
joined
us
my
mother
amused
herself
with
affecting
a
ridiculous
pity
for
him
lady
barlowe
painted
her
astonishment
while
his
uncle
with
much
more
sincerity
laboured
to
impress
us
with
an
adequate
idea
of
the
terror
he
had
suffered
the
preceding
evening
every
syllable
sunk
into
the
soul
of
murden
he
preserved
an
inflexible
and
haughty
silence
but
i
saw
in
his
agitated
countenance
that
he
was
frequently
on
the
point
of
bursting
into
rage
and
madness
sir
thomas
barlowe
will
on
many
occasions
wind
a
shapeless
circumstance
round
and
round
till
he
has
persuaded
himself
he
has
discovered
something
in
it
really
insulting
and
injurious
to
him
he
now
conjectured
surmised
and
talked
of
behaviour
till
he
had
assured
himself
it
could
have
no
other
design
than
to
afflict
him
the
most
affectionate
of
uncles
and
having
for
a
short
time
indulged
in
the
pathos
of
lamentation
he
began
to
weep
although
i
could
scarcely
forbear
smiling
at
sir
thomas
barlowe
folly
yet
i
was
considerably
affected
by
the
sudden
transition
the
tears
produced
in
murden
he
forgot
his
anger
and
his
dejection
he
pressed
his
uncle
hand
soothed
him
with
kind
expressions
and
suddenly
assuming
an
air
of
cheerfulness
began
to
hand
the
cups
and
arrange
the
are
in
love
with
some
creature
you
are
ashamed
of
murden
said
my
mother
will
swear
it
madam
replied
he
do
tell
me
nephew
arthur
said
the
baronet
you
tore
it
to
pieces
so
unmercifully
tell
me
dear
arthur
all
about
that
letter
why
should
he
sibella
have
fixed
his
eyes
on
me
while
the
colour
rushed
from
his
cheek
at
the
mention
of
that
letter
why
did
he
groan
why
did
he
appear
no
more
during
the
whole
of
that
day
why
has
he
since
been
so
uniformly
pensive
why
seek
me
as
a
companion
yet
reject
me
as
a
friend
such
are
the
enquiries
constantly
obtruding
themselves
upon
me
adieu
dear
sibella
the
remainder
of
davenport
story
must
again
be
deferred
till
another
opportunity
caroline
ashburn
letter
iii
from
clement
montgomery
to
arthur
murden
sweet
enthusiast
i
loveliest
romancer
sustained
by
thee
i
could
boldly
defy
the
maxims
of
the
world
could
bear
unmoved
its
taunting
scorns
its
loudest
reproaches
stimulated
by
thy
visionary
precepts
i
could
rush
alone
on
its
host
of
temptations
and
attempt
with
the
giant
step
of
fortitude
to
tread
their
legions
into
nothingness
methinks
arthur
i
see
her
now
and
an
increase
of
warmth
glides
through
every
vein
till
it
reaches
my
heart
which
glows
and
throbs
more
proudly
and
more
proudly
that
the
arbitress
of
its
every
motion
is
sibella
valmont
let
imagination
dress
up
her
most
airy
forms
let
fancy
exhaust
the
riches
of
her
invention
the
vision
thus
created
may
dazzle
may
delude
in
the
absence
of
perfection
but
bring
the
charms
of
sibella
in
contrast
and
it
sinks
into
vapour
painting
and
language
are
alike
incompetent
to
represent
ha
that
thought
again
shoots
across
my
brain
i
i
was
inconstant
oh
i
would
give
an
eye
an
ear
nay
a
limb
that
i
had
never
known
other
embraces
then
i
might
have
been
all
soul
too
what
she
now
is
what
i
can
imagine
but
never
shall
yes
you
gave
the
advice
murden
and
i
deserving
almost
damnation
for
the
deed
stooped
to
gross
allurements
and
obeyed
the
calls
of
appetite
and
i
ought
to
have
braved
death
in
support
of
my
constancy
thank
god
she
can
not
know
it
and
oh
may
annihilation
or
the
worst
of
curses
fall
on
this
head
rather
than
i
again
pollute
myself
or
entertain
one
thought
within
my
breast
that
may
not
rank
with
her
angelic
purity
yes
murden
i
say
purity
ay
and
she
is
as
pure
as
angels
notwithstanding
clement
has
been
admitted
to
her
embraces
for
i
am
her
husband
she
never
heard
of
ties
more
holy
more
binding
than
those
of
the
heart
custom
has
not
placed
its
sordid
restraint
on
her
feelings
nature
forms
her
impulses
oh
she
is
nature
genuine
child
more
lovely
than
painting
can
trace
yet
robust
as
the
peasant
who
climbs
yon
hill
to
toil
for
his
hourly
subsistence
soft
as
her
lover
bounding
wishes
can
desire
yet
stedfast
aspiring
brave
enough
to
lead
an
army
in
the
field
no
cowardly
apprehensions
enter
her
mind
she
shrinks
not
from
the
wintry
blast
let
the
torrent
descend
the
wind
howl
the
lowering
thunder
roar
it
affects
not
her
peace
no
trembling
nerves
has
she
methinks
i
see
her
now
i
hear
again
the
harmony
of
that
voice
now
softening
into
the
scarcely
audible
adieu
now
rising
into
firmness
to
instruct
her
clement
how
to
bear
his
destiny
i
had
just
quitted
valmont
study
where
i
underwent
another
torturing
repetition
of
all
the
inconsistency
of
his
designs
for
us
so
freezing
was
his
language
that
it
appeared
to
chill
sensation
and
when
he
presented
me
the
which
is
to
open
my
prospects
in
life
i
was
scarcely
sensible
either
of
its
value
or
i
believe
i
never
thanked
him
and
though
i
did
not
take
his
offered
hand
its
touch
i
dreaded
more
than
the
torpedo
languid
sunk
and
overwhelmed
i
crawled
with
feeble
steps
to
my
what
a
change
her
vigour
awakened
mine
and
as
though
hope
perseverance
and
courage
had
resigned
themselves
to
her
guidance
she
commanded
them
to
possess
me
wholly
commanded
me
to
receive
the
noble
inmates
and
to
vow
i
would
be
bravely
independent
though
a
bed
of
straw
were
my
portion
and
crumbs
my
fare
i
write
this
letter
at
my
first
resting
place
since
i
quitted
valmont
castle
and
the
benignancy
of
my
lovely
sibella
has
even
chased
my
resentment
towards
you
but
should
an
hour
of
lassitude
perchance
creep
on
me
in
my
banishment
i
may
be
tempted
to
enquire
narrowly
into
the
nature
of
your
very
mysterious
epistles
clement
montgomery
letter
iv
from
sibella
valmont
to
caroline
ashburn
clement
my
clement
is
gone
all
is
silence
around
me
the
trees
have
dropped
their
leafy
ornaments
the
wind
sweeps
through
them
in
mournful
cadence
their
foliage
no
longer
intercepts
my
eye
when
it
would
extend
itself
around
the
vast
horizon
i
now
seated
on
the
ruins
of
the
hermitage
view
this
space
and
tell
myself
it
contains
not
one
being
to
whom
sibella
is
the
object
of
esteem
tenderness
or
concern
oh
caroline
caroline
i
am
weary
of
this
solitude
my
mind
bursts
the
bounds
prescribed
to
my
person
and
impels
itself
forward
to
share
the
advantages
of
society
compelled
to
return
to
its
prison
it
is
disgusted
with
its
own
conceptions
and
sinks
into
languor
and
dissatisfaction
could
it
be
my
parents
who
doomed
me
to
this
slavery
did
they
deem
the
benefits
of
intercourse
a
blessing
too
great
for
their
innocent
offspring
no
it
must
be
valmont
own
plan
is
he
alone
who
could
wish
to
rob
me
of
the
faculties
of
my
soul
and
finding
i
dare
think
dare
aim
to
extend
them
dare
seek
to
be
happy
he
shuns
me
with
aversion
or
loads
me
with
reproach
why
if
he
meant
me
to
degenerate
into
the
mere
brute
did
he
not
chain
me
in
a
cave
shut
out
the
light
of
the
glorious
sun
forbid
me
to
converse
with
intelligent
nature
then
i
might
have
expressed
my
wants
in
a
savage
way
have
ravenously
satisfied
the
calls
of
hunger
or
thirst
and
lying
down
to
enjoy
the
sleep
of
apathy
have
thought
if
i
could
have
thought
at
all
that
this
was
to
be
happy
a
being
superior
to
this
only
in
a
little
craft
did
valmont
design
to
make
me
a
timid
docile
slave
whose
thoughts
will
passions
wishes
should
have
no
standard
of
their
own
but
rise
change
or
die
as
the
will
of
a
master
should
require
such
is
the
height
of
virtues
i
have
heard
valmont
describe
as
my
zenith
of
perfection
he
laments
that
he
suffered
me
to
share
in
clement
education
happy
mistake
then
i
found
i
was
to
be
the
friend
and
companion
of
man
man
the
image
of
divinity
where
then
are
the
boundaries
placed
that
are
to
restrain
my
thought
to
be
the
companion
i
must
be
equal
to
be
the
friend
i
must
have
comprehension
and
judgment
must
be
able
to
assist
or
willing
to
be
taught
in
the
little
intercourse
i
have
had
with
valmont
she
also
has
placed
before
me
her
picture
of
females
a
picture
as
absurd
and
much
more
unintelligible
to
me
than
the
other
she
represents
beauty
as
the
supreme
good
ascribes
to
it
the
most
fabulous
effects
of
power
conquest
and
dominion
she
represented
me
to
myself
as
entering
your
world
and
transformed
me
into
a
being
so
totally
without
description
that
i
ran
from
her
to
seek
again
my
own
nature
to
find
the
friend
and
companion
of
man
you
caroline
are
not
such
as
either
of
these
people
describe
no
nor
am
i
then
shall
i
but
let
me
be
content
a
very
short
time
and
i
shall
join
my
clement
shall
aid
his
labour
with
my
exertions
oh
my
clement
my
love
my
lover
speed
forward
to
the
accomplishment
of
thy
talk
oh
be
thy
desires
as
bounded
as
my
wishes
thy
sibella
covets
no
castles
no
palaces
seek
for
her
but
a
shelter
from
inclemency
and
take
her
therein
to
liberty
to
thee
often
caroline
have
i
imagined
the
useless
parts
of
that
vast
building
converted
into
little
cottages
such
as
i
have
seen
from
the
top
of
its
turrets
fancy
has
instantly
peopled
the
desert
i
have
believed
myself
surrounded
by
an
active
hardy
race
i
have
arisen
to
enjoy
the
delights
of
communication
when
perchance
the
rushing
of
a
silent
fawn
through
the
thicket
has
awakened
me
from
my
trance
has
reminded
me
that
i
too
was
one
of
the
solitary
herd
that
the
castle
with
its
moats
walls
and
battlements
yet
stood
where
gloom
and
silence
hold
their
court
where
valmont
presides
and
denies
sibella
his
presence
and
where
the
inexorable
key
is
turned
on
that
library
lest
she
should
think
too
often
or
too
well
andrew
comes
through
the
wood
he
beckons
holds
up
a
is
your
caroline
i
have
pondered
on
the
contents
of
your
letter
three
days
what
shall
i
say
for
myself
more
than
you
have
already
said
for
me
i
feel
i
confess
that
in
being
secret
i
have
deceived
valmont
have
been
guilty
of
vice
but
how
could
i
tell
me
caroline
for
my
future
benefit
tell
if
you
can
how
could
i
devise
a
means
by
which
i
might
have
preserved
my
sincerity
and
saved
my
lover
i
can
not
remember
it
was
my
clement
peace
happiness
and
welfare
for
which
i
made
the
sacrifice
yet
now
i
feel
it
forcibly
for
i
hesitate
to
declare
the
rest
i
who
knew
no
concealment
have
by
one
deviation
from
my
sincerity
even
become
cowardly
and
irresolute
in
friendship
i
fear
your
censures
caroline
and
dare
think
of
eluding
them
because
too
conscious
that
i
can
not
refute
i
persevere
in
secresy
in
deception
valmont
is
still
unacquainted
with
our
marriage
for
myself
i
had
not
done
this
for
myself
i
could
not
perceive
its
value
or
necessity
i
yielded
to
the
ardent
remonstrances
of
clement
and
promised
to
conceal
our
union
till
his
independence
should
have
placed
him
beyond
the
mischief
of
my
uncle
resentment
ah
let
me
turn
to
seek
solace
in
the
end
for
the
means
be
the
means
what
they
may
the
end
is
effected
my
clement
is
restored
the
energies
of
his
mind
are
renovated
you
will
see
him
caroline
but
you
will
see
no
feebleness
in
his
character
you
will
find
his
love
could
never
be
trifling
you
will
discover
that
we
mutually
love
from
the
knowledge
of
increasing
and
no
fabled
or
real
oblivion
can
shed
its
influence
on
a
love
so
elevated
so
entire
so
utterly
beyond
the
reach
of
annihilation
i
conjure
you
my
friend
by
your
own
words
to
watch
over
my
clement
to
preserve
him
free
from
taint
and
to
restore
him
just
such
as
he
so
lately
quitted
the
arms
of
his
and
your
letter
v
from
arthur
murden
to
caroline
ashburn
madam
that
i
most
ardently
desire
to
possess
your
esteem
is
whether
you
believe
it
or
not
a
fact
i
avow
with
all
possible
sincerity
nor
is
it
less
a
fact
that
i
quitted
bath
so
abruptly
to
avoid
giving
you
my
confidence
the
only
thing
in
the
world
by
which
i
could
be
entitled
to
ask
your
esteem
do
i
then
write
to
you
you
are
about
to
demand
ah
madam
i
have
by
me
a
long
catalogue
of
such
unanswered
questions
why
do
i
do
this
and
why
do
i
do
that
insolently
treads
on
the
heel
of
my
almost
every
action
can
you
find
a
name
more
despicable
than
folly
for
the
will
that
acts
in
opposition
to
acknowledged
reason
if
you
can
apply
that
worst
of
names
to
me
to
my
incomprehensible
conduct
oh
miss
ashburn
almost
without
a
motive
have
i
pursued
a
dream
a
phantasy
the
offspring
of
my
heated
fancy
lent
her
utmost
delusions
and
dressed
the
vision
in
such
glowing
charms
that
neither
prudence
honour
friendship
nor
aught
else
could
stay
me
in
my
course
not
even
the
heavenly
whither
am
i
running
i
would
give
a
world
that
i
could
tell
you
when
where
why
i
dreamt
and
was
awakened
not
for
a
world
wealth
though
would
i
tell
you
is
past
is
done
the
mischief
is
the
phantom
remains
but
the
gilded
hope
that
illumined
her
path
is
gone
despair
casts
its
length
of
shade
around
me
and
sunshine
is
no
more
let
me
recollect
when
i
began
to
write
i
meant
to
request
you
would
say
something
conciliating
for
me
to
sir
thomas
the
letter
i
left
for
him
was
written
in
haste
and
from
a
sudden
impulse
and
probably
expressed
nothing
i
either
meant
or
ought
to
have
said
i
beseech
you
madam
do
this
for
me
i
know
my
uncle
looks
on
me
with
affection
and
i
do
not
consider
myself
entitled
to
make
so
free
with
the
happiness
of
others
as
i
have
done
with
my
own
if
he
has
any
expostulations
to
offer
any
reproaches
to
make
me
let
him
send
them
to
barlowe
hall
there
i
shall
be
some
time
but
let
him
not
ask
me
to
come
to
no
miss
ashburn
the
is
still
in
view
and
though
i
perfectly
understand
its
nature
and
have
no
hope
nor
scarce
a
wish
to
overtake
it
yet
am
i
galloping
after
it
over
hedge
bog
and
briar
from
this
assurance
and
from
the
many
other
things
you
know
of
me
you
will
believe
i
am
in
the
right
to
subscribe
myself
the
infatuated
miserable
murden
letter
vi
from
caroline
ashburn
to
sibella
valmont
for
the
first
time
of
my
life
have
i
become
the
assiduous
watcher
of
windows
the
listener
after
footsteps
and
have
lived
eternally
in
the
drawing
room
yet
has
no
clement
montgomery
appeared
and
i
have
just
now
recollected
that
my
desire
of
knowing
him
will
not
accelerate
his
approach
that
so
much
time
given
to
expectation
is
so
much
thrown
away
and
that
to
employ
the
same
quantity
of
time
in
endeavouring
to
amuse
you
would
be
more
friendly
and
of
course
more
laudable
once
more
then
sibella
we
are
in
london
this
great
metropolis
alike
the
resort
of
him
who
possesses
wealth
and
him
who
seeks
to
attain
it
here
merit
comes
hoping
in
the
vast
concourse
to
find
the
protector
of
talent
and
hither
the
deliberating
villain
hastens
expecting
the
crowd
will
be
at
once
favourable
to
the
practice
of
his
crimes
and
the
means
of
escaping
their
punishment
what
a
field
here
is
opened
for
the
speculator
and
the
moralist
and
often
sibella
do
i
anticipate
the
time
when
we
shall
look
on
the
chequered
scenes
of
life
together
when
but
let
me
give
you
the
remainder
of
davenport
history
while
is
is
yet
fresh
in
my
memory
punctual
to
the
minute
i
had
named
davenport
entered
my
apartment
the
same
species
of
settled
gloom
i
observed
the
preceding
day
in
arabella
marked
his
voice
and
gesture
he
looked
so
familiarized
so
wedded
to
sadness
and
misfortune
that
desirous
of
expressing
in
my
demeanour
the
kindness
my
heart
felt
for
him
i
approached
and
held
out
my
hand
to
receive
his
he
lightly
pressed
it
and
coldly
bowing
retreated
to
a
seat
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
from
that
motion
i
perceived
he
now
viewed
me
as
one
who
had
saved
him
from
the
commission
of
an
action
which
although
of
evil
and
dangerous
tendency
would
have
produced
to
him
a
benefit
he
knew
not
how
in
any
other
way
to
procure
and
that
after
rendering
it
impossible
for
him
to
marry
i
was
about
to
leave
him
with
some
general
advice
to
the
horrors
of
his
situation
this
he
imagined
was
the
utmost
of
my
ability
he
had
convinced
himself
of
the
goodness
of
my
intentions
and
could
not
altogether
call
me
his
enemy
but
he
was
now
looking
round
hopeless
and
despairing
for
the
almost
supernatural
means
which
could
extricate
him
from
his
poverty
and
distress
the
power
was
mine
and
i
hastened
to
relieve
him
from
the
anguish
he
endured
i
told
him
he
should
render
himself
independent
and
happy
that
my
pecuniary
assistance
should
go
hand
and
hand
with
his
endeavours
and
enquired
if
he
had
any
friends
who
could
advise
him
in
the
choice
of
a
profession
a
creature
in
the
world
who
would
not
rather
advise
him
to
end
his
miseries
and
disgrace
with
a
pistol
this
was
davenport
answer
i
recollected
that
i
had
noticed
some
little
intimacy
between
him
and
murden
and
supposing
the
precariousness
of
dependence
must
have
occasionally
led
murden
thoughts
to
the
same
views
i
concluded
his
judgment
would
be
useful
us
consult
murden
said
i
miss
ashburn
cried
davenport
reddening
violently
it
all
yourself
i
will
obey
you
wherever
i
can
but
do
not
command
me
to
the
revolting
task
of
declaring
to
all
the
world
that
i
am
a
beggar
when
murden
and
i
first
knew
each
other
i
was
the
expected
heir
to
a
good
fortune
and
as
i
was
descended
from
some
of
the
first
families
in
the
kingdom
murden
moved
in
a
sphere
below
me
he
stands
where
he
did
but
i
alas
am
yet
i
wo
hear
him
exult
and
triumph
in
affected
no
no
i
could
tell
him
that
even
a
nabob
wealth
can
not
blazen
him
with
the
honours
that
cling
to
the
name
of
davenport
he
spoke
this
with
surprising
bitterness
pity
sake
davenport
said
i
not
lay
on
high
birth
more
infirmities
than
from
its
nature
it
unavoidably
possesses
were
you
ten
times
more
honourably
descended
it
could
not
alter
murden
ability
to
advise
you
it
could
not
degrade
him
or
exalt
you
i
have
seen
you
court
his
conversation
and
did
you
imagine
your
poverty
was
then
a
secret
oh
no
who
could
mistake
the
cause
of
your
seeking
to
become
ashburn
husband
in
defiance
of
his
uncle
displeasure
murden
refused
this
very
marriage
at
the
same
time
i
must
acknowledge
his
firmness
has
not
undergone
the
trial
you
have
suffered
for
he
had
no
arabella
i
believe
davenport
threw
his
arms
across
upon
the
table
by
which
he
sat
laying
his
head
upon
them
the
attitude
prevented
my
seeing
his
face
but
i
thought
he
wept
a
half
supressed
sob
rose
at
intervals
thus
he
remained
for
unwilling
to
press
too
hard
on
his
prejudices
i
relinquished
the
idea
of
consulting
any
other
person
and
sat
silently
examining
plans
for
his
future
service
his
age
his
quickness
of
apprehension
and
his
manners
which
are
pleasing
to
persons
of
every
station
inclined
me
to
think
the
study
of
physic
would
be
well
adapted
to
his
capacity
and
talents
i
made
the
proposal
named
the
sum
i
would
give
him
yearly
till
he
should
be
qualified
to
provide
for
himself
and
his
gratitude
was
expressed
with
the
same
vehemence
which
alike
attends
him
on
trivial
or
important
occasions
you
will
perhaps
wonder
sibella
that
is
if
the
value
of
money
is
at
all
known
to
you
and
if
its
importance
ever
occupies
your
thoughts
how
am
i
enabled
to
make
so
lavish
a
use
of
it
on
our
first
arrival
in
england
my
mother
assigned
me
an
annual
income
proportioned
to
the
splendour
of
her
appearance
and
the
immense
fortune
that
i
am
destined
to
possess
when
her
advantages
in
it
shall
be
eternally
proscribed
that
i
do
not
employ
this
allowance
in
keeping
pace
with
her
elegance
that
i
do
not
blaze
in
jewels
and
riot
in
the
luxury
of
dress
displeases
my
mother
yet
she
continues
me
the
stated
income
flattering
herself
daily
though
daily
disappointed
that
i
will
secure
my
own
indulgencies
by
overlooking
the
errors
reason
tells
me
i
am
to
condemn
in
her
but
to
return
to
davenport
on
the
subsequent
morning
i
ordered
my
horse
very
early
intending
to
pass
an
hour
with
arabella
when
a
servant
informed
me
davenport
and
a
lady
requested
to
see
me
i
hurried
down
stairs
to
chide
davenport
for
suffering
arabella
supposing
it
must
be
her
to
hazard
an
increase
of
her
disorder
by
coming
out
while
the
air
was
raw
and
cold
and
the
morning
fog
not
yet
dispelled
i
opened
the
parlour
door
with
the
reproof
almost
ready
on
my
lips
when
davenport
with
his
eyes
glistening
his
cheeks
glowing
seized
my
hand
and
placed
it
within
that
of
a
young
lady
who
kissed
it
and
with
mingled
ardour
and
pleasure
pressed
it
to
her
bosom
surprised
i
stepped
back
and
looking
alternately
at
her
and
at
davenport
a
strong
resemblance
anticipated
his
introduction
of
a
sister
this
sister
whom
davenport
had
forgotten
in
his
misfortunes
was
newly
married
and
had
arrived
at
bath
the
preceding
evening
with
her
husband
a
merchant
of
the
name
of
beville
davenport
had
related
the
scenes
he
had
passed
through
in
those
glowing
colours
whose
use
is
so
familiar
to
him
and
the
whole
family
were
disposed
to
think
i
had
rendered
them
an
important
service
accepting
beville
invitation
to
dinner
i
was
that
day
introduced
also
to
beville
and
miss
harriot
davenport
davenport
feelings
are
ever
alive
to
extremes
he
was
now
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
he
saw
his
sister
no
longer
the
humble
dependent
of
a
proud
relation
but
the
wife
of
an
affectionate
opulent
husband
sharing
her
advantages
too
with
his
other
sister
then
how
could
davenport
look
at
them
and
remember
either
what
he
had
been
or
might
yet
be
he
was
extravagant
sometimes
brilliant
but
always
fanciful
and
the
incoherencies
of
his
conversation
formed
an
amusing
contrast
with
the
steady
uniform
bluntness
of
beville
he
was
even
too
gay
to
be
grateful
for
instead
of
thanking
his
for
an
offer
of
taking
him
into
immediate
partnership
in
preference
to
the
plan
i
had
proposed
on
terms
so
liberal
as
brought
tears
from
his
sister
eyes
davenport
began
to
ridicule
and
burlesque
trade
he
was
determined
for
this
afternoon
at
least
to
enjoy
his
mirth
in
defiance
of
the
checks
instigations
or
reproaches
of
the
better
inmates
sincerity
and
common
sense
poor
fellow
the
grimace
the
laugh
the
jest
reign
no
longer
for
arabella
can
not
live
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
prospects
of
her
henry
with
his
affection
for
her
child
and
the
present
attentions
of
his
family
to
her
she
calmly
looks
forward
to
that
abode
where
the
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
while
he
suffers
ten
thousand
agonies
in
anticipating
their
eternal
separation
with
beville
and
harriot
davenport
the
remembrance
of
former
transgression
now
lies
dormant
their
former
affection
revives
gains
new
strength
from
the
aid
of
pity
and
instigates
them
to
attend
the
dying
arabella
as
a
sister
but
i
suspect
from
accidental
hints
they
are
yet
infected
with
the
worldly
maxim
that
the
guilt
of
such
a
sailing
remains
wholly
with
the
female
from
whom
in
every
other
instance
of
life
we
look
for
nothing
but
weakness
and
defect
love
more
perhaps
than
reason
has
taught
davenport
a
better
lesson
he
would
certainly
have
married
arabella
and
beville
would
have
supported
him
in
the
resolution
knowing
it
to
be
now
as
much
his
duty
as
it
was
before
their
mutual
duty
to
abstain
from
the
transgression
thus
have
i
saved
davenport
but
not
my
mother
no
she
will
assuredly
marry
to
prove
to
me
her
power
and
she
will
pique
herself
also
on
choosing
a
husband
as
handsome
as
engaging
as
the
fugitive
davenport
in
the
mean
time
flattery
is
flattery
and
the
dose
being
doubled
from
a
female
tongue
approaches
so
near
to
an
equivalent
that
the
immediate
necessity
of
a
lover
becomes
less
urgent
the
happy
ashburn
happy
in
her
acquisitions
has
lately
gained
a
companion
who
can
treble
the
quantity
on
occasion
in
good
english
language
with
the
animation
of
french
vivacity
and
french
action
mademoiselle
laundy
deals
out
her
bursts
of
admiration
and
exstacies
of
rapture
from
one
of
the
prettiest
mouths
in
the
world
shaping
herself
most
to
the
whim
of
the
moment
my
mother
sees
not
that
she
is
young
and
handsome
and
could
a
painting
be
shown
to
ashburn
the
exact
but
silent
representation
of
mademoiselle
laundy
unless
previously
instructed
to
look
for
the
likeness
i
am
positive
she
would
not
recognize
one
feature
of
her
companion
this
young
person
was
born
of
english
parents
who
were
settled
in
france
her
father
being
deprived
of
an
enormous
pension
by
the
change
of
government
chose
rather
to
break
his
heart
than
live
upon
a
contracted
income
which
could
only
furnish
him
with
the
necessaries
of
life
and
such
worthless
accommodations
as
are
beneath
the
enjoyment
of
a
courtier
after
his
decease
a
dutchess
brought
mademoiselle
laundy
to
england
to
try
her
fortune
and
most
opportunely
chance
threw
her
in
our
way
at
the
very
same
time
when
my
mother
was
seized
with
the
rage
of
entertaining
a
companion
money
was
an
object
with
mademoiselle
laundy
but
none
to
ashburn
and
the
former
knew
how
to
hold
off
from
the
bargain
till
the
latter
wishes
and
expectations
were
wound
up
to
the
highest
the
pride
also
of
enabling
her
companion
to
outdress
half
the
fashionable
young
women
about
town
was
doubtless
an
additional
motive
with
ashburn
and
the
enormous
salary
demanded
was
to
me
the
first
unfavourable
specimen
of
mademoiselle
laundy
principles
nor
has
the
young
lady
improved
on
farther
acquaintance
supple
as
she
is
she
can
not
accommodate
the
feigned
artlessness
of
her
countenance
to
the
examination
of
my
eye
native
simplicity
would
neither
court
nor
retire
but
mademoiselle
laundy
invites
my
favour
while
she
evades
my
scrutiny
resigning
her
personal
pretensions
to
charm
and
labouring
incessantly
to
acknowledge
the
already
inflated
superiority
of
the
people
around
her
she
becomes
the
universal
favourite
and
is
hard
to
say
whether
the
unfortunate
mademoiselle
laundy
is
more
necessary
to
ashburn
or
to
ashburn
acquaintance
to
her
establishment
here
however
i
can
not
object
because
i
should
not
be
understood
picking
and
stealing
to
be
sure
are
very
atrocious
things
but
who
ever
thought
of
calling
selfishness
art
and
insincerity
by
the
name
of
vice
oh
no
philosophers
may
speculate
and
dream
over
their
airy
systems
but
we
people
of
fashion
know
better
things
we
know
and
insincerity
to
be
useful
and
important
qualities
the
grand
cement
which
binds
our
intercourse
with
each
other
born
a
superior
race
we
can
bid
truth
and
plain
honesty
depart
and
having
dressed
falsehood
and
guile
in
all
the
fascination
of
the
senses
can
bow
down
before
the
idol
of
our
own
creation
is
all
true
sibella
although
in
rambling
about
your
woods
and
looking
into
your
own
heart
and
arranging
the
matter
of
your
former
studies
you
may
find
what
ought
to
be
you
can
not
discover
one
trait
of
what
really
exists
sir
thomas
barlowe
is
ill
of
the
gout
and
almost
pines
in
his
confinement
for
the
society
of
his
nephew
while
the
whimsical
murden
in
defiance
of
command
or
intreaty
is
capering
about
the
country
nobody
knows
why
nor
nobody
knows
where
murden
why
can
not
i
name
murden
without
feeling
a
portion
of
that
anxiety
which
so
visibly
preys
on
the
happiness
and
throws
a
veil
of
mystery
over
the
actions
of
that
inconsistent
young
man
various
have
been
the
endeavours
i
have
used
to
understand
the
nature
of
his
mind
disease
but
he
has
wrapped
an
impenetrable
fold
of
secresy
around
his
heart
at
times
i
imagined
that
acknowledgment
was
ready
to
burst
from
his
lips
nay
i
even
imagined
at
times
i
had
caught
some
remote
allusions
that
i
thought
i
understood
yet
in
attempting
to
trace
them
to
a
source
i
lost
their
original
form
and
became
more
and
more
entangled
in
the
labyrinths
of
surmise
as
sir
thomas
and
lady
barlowe
regulate
all
their
jaunts
and
expeditions
by
ours
and
as
we
have
together
made
one
household
at
bath
it
was
natural
enough
that
we
should
journey
together
to
london
murden
of
course
was
included
in
the
arrangements
and
he
neither
breathed
a
syllable
of
doubt
or
objection
to
the
plan
the
evening
before
we
quitted
bath
our
party
included
only
four
or
five
visitors
but
had
there
been
twenty
i
must
have
directed
all
my
attention
towards
murden
the
preceding
day
i
had
seen
him
petulant
and
the
preceding
part
of
that
day
i
had
observed
him
to
be
more
than
commonly
pensive
and
absent
he
did
not
appear
at
dinner
but
joined
us
early
in
the
evening
with
smiles
and
gaiety
so
sudden
and
so
singular
a
change
excited
my
wonder
and
curiosity
i
perceived
it
was
not
the
gaiety
of
force
yet
it
had
a
tinge
of
complacent
melancholy
and
from
his
subsequent
conduct
i
am
convinced
it
had
its
origin
in
some
determination
he
had
taken
whether
for
himself
fortunate
or
unfortunate
the
sequel
alone
can
explain
he
shook
my
hand
affectionately
when
he
bade
us
good
night
and
at
breakfast
the
following
morning
we
learned
that
he
had
galloped
away
at
day
break
he
had
left
a
letter
for
his
uncle
not
filled
with
flattering
apologies
never
fear
it
but
containing
a
short
harangue
on
the
impossibility
of
his
going
at
present
to
london
and
a
few
cold
wishes
for
the
general
safety
of
the
party
at
large
since
that
time
i
also
have
been
favoured
with
a
letter
from
him
which
although
it
is
not
intended
to
elucidate
any
part
of
his
conduct
has
brought
back
to
my
mind
with
additional
force
a
surmise
i
formerly
dismissed
as
too
improbable
what
a
length
of
letter
you
see
sibella
how
closely
i
consider
our
feelings
as
united
for
while
i
endure
no
weariness
myself
i
fear
not
the
chance
of
inflicting
it
upon
you
adieu
my
sweet
friend
may
principle
alone
not
personal
fatal
experience
teach
you
that
your
present
system
of
secresy
is
erroneous

letter
vii
from

to
sir
walter
boyer
what
a
life
have
i
led
these
three
days
an
old
house
my
habitation
built
according
to
old
customs
with
its
casements
staring
at
one
another
across
a
narrow
court
and
the
very
offices
turning
their
backs
on
noble
prospects
two
old
men
and
one
ugly
old
woman
my
companions
no
young
nor
pretty
face
abides
within
these
walls
for
thy
poor
amusement
called
up
at
nine
and
what
is
still
worse
sent
to
bed
at
eleven
did
you
ever
go
to
bed
at
eleven
boyer
there
i
wake
and
dose
and
dream
dream
i
hear
the
inspiring
rattle
of
dice
boxes
wake
and
curse
myself
for
ever
having
known
their
enticements
and
then
curse
them
for
not
being
now
beside
me
what
in
the
name
of
wonder
could
have
become
of
you
the
day
i
left
london
your
valet
was
drunk
when
i
stopped
full
of
intelligence
at
your
lodgings
uc
and
hic
was
all
i
could
get
from
the
fellow
for
a
time
and
then
followed
sir
to
be
sure
my
lord
i
tell
you
at
once
my
lord
is
gone
sir
in
a
and
four
my
lord
is
sir
walter
gone
puppy
walter
my
lord
oh
yes
sir
walter
is
gone
i
do
know
where
he
is
gone
sir
walter
drive
on
cried
i
and
home
i
went
to
step
from
my
carriage
to
the
travelling
chaise
in
which
with
my
dear
father
i
was
gently
whirled
down
to
monkton
hall
what
a
life
have
i
led
these
three
days
a
pestilence
on
your
throat
i
say
there
he
sits
walter
the
bird
of
night
and
wisdom
and
with
his
quavering
hoo
oo
oo
calls
on
me
to
be
solemn
if
i
ca
be
wise
i
hate
wisdom
and
had
i
not
a
story
to
tell
you
would
sit
down
and
rail
at
it
every
clock
from
every
steeple
last
wednesday
morning
sounded
seven
as
i
with
pledged
honour
and
empty
pockets
drove
home
from
the
memento
was
insolent
and
i
was
splenetic
i
longed
to
throw
stones
at
the
steeples
and
to
knock
down
each
sturdy
porter
who
looked
into
the
chariot
to
inform
me
by
his
clear
eye
and
vigorous
step
that
he
has
passed
the
night
in
rest
and
had
arisen
poor
indeed
but
happy
impudent
scoundrel
he
a
porter
i
a
viscount
i
undressed
and
went
to
bed
where
i
had
the
felicity
of
ruminating
till
ten
upon
the
vast
increase
of
my
knowledge
and
happiness
since
i
became
so
intimately
connected
with
spellman
and
his
associates
at
which
hour
of
ten
the
earl
sent
a
servant
to
request
i
would
breakfast
with
him
qualms
of
apprehension
stole
upon
me
i
foreboded
strange
discoveries
and
severe
remonstrances
and
as
i
felt
too
humbled
in
my
own
opinion
to
be
insolent
even
to
my
father
i
considered
how
to
avoid
the
interview
till
i
had
mechanically
staggered
into
the
where
i
was
received
with
morning
to
your
lordship
hope
you
are
well
my
lord
said
i
and
throwing
myself
across
the
sopha
we
sipped
a
cup
of
chocolate
in
silence
enquired
for
you
last
evening
said
the
earl
believe
lord
filmar
it
was
extremely
late
ere
you
came
home
was
extremely
late
my
lord
replied
i
as
i
so
readily
agreed
in
his
opinion
the
earl
was
at
a
loss
how
to
proceed
twice
he
removed
his
chair
played
with
a
and
we
finished
our
chocolate
after
the
breakfast
things
were
removed
the
earl
turned
his
chair
more
toward
me
said
he
i
arose
and
wished
his
lordship
a
good
morning
lord
filmar
a
moment
pray
sit
down
hem
i
understand
but
too
well
that
is
i
suspect
i
am
fearful
the
company
you
keep
will
do
you
harm
now
walter
this
man
the
earl
of
elsings
a
peer
of
the
realm
of
great
britain
had
not
courage
to
say
to
his
own
son
thou
art
a
fool
and
wilt
be
a
beggar
thy
companions
are
gamblers
sharpers
and
knaves
and
henceforward
i
command
thee
to
abstain
from
their
society
astonish
me
my
lord
answered
i
with
great
apparent
simplicity
could
not
suppose
i
should
displease
you
by
associating
with
men
of
rank
certainly
not
by
no
means
only
i
would
insinuate
that
play
is
dangerous
and
your
income
small
small
indeed
thought
i
a
considerable
pause
succeeded
and
then
my
father
countenance
brightened
purpose
going
down
this
day
to
sir
gilbert
monkton
said
he
i
wished
him
an
agreeable
journey
must
go
with
me
lord
filmar
pray
excuse
me
sir
consider
the
season
the
place
and
the
society
how
can
your
lordship
plan
such
an
expedition
at
this
part
of
the
year
you
will
inevitably
bring
on
an
ague
or
a
nervous
fever
dear
my
lord
do
think
of
it
replied
the
earl
but
a
view
to
your
interest
could
have
determined
me
to
make
sir
gilbert
a
visit
now
your
interest
lord
filmar
has
strong
claims
upon
me
your
present
income
scarcely
exceeds
and
you
well
know
that
with
all
my
care
and
prudence
i
have
not
so
far
recovered
former
encumbrances
as
to
be
able
to
leave
with
the
title
of
elsings
more
than
a
clear
per
annum
the
earl
paused
hemmed
picked
up
a
scrap
of
paper
then
hemmed
again
and
proceeded
know
i
think
you
know
mr
valmont
i
bowed
assent
and
the
earl
looked
as
if
he
wished
i
had
spoken
but
i
was
resolved
to
hear
him
to
the
end
you
do
know
valmont
a
very
singular
man
he
has
strange
ideas
of
education
in
all
our
conversations
on
the
topic
i
never
could
be
brought
to
coincide
with
him
yet
he
is
a
worthy
man
too
he
has
a
prodigious
fine
estate
at
moor
down
and
that
estate
round
the
castle
is
in
excellent
order
a
strange
gothic
dismal
place
that
castle
of
his
to
be
sure
i
can
not
remember
how
long
it
is
since
it
was
built
but
it
was
a
valmont
built
it
i
know
it
has
never
been
out
of
the
family
yet
i
wonder
he
should
choose
always
to
reside
in
it
and
to
keep
his
niece
in
it
also
his
niece
hem
you
know
lord
filmar
i
am
one
of
miss
valmont
guardians
i
bowed
again
am
told
she
is
very
handsome
she
was
a
beautiful
child
i
have
not
seen
her
these
ten
years
it
was
very
singular
indeed
i
think
to
guard
her
so
closely
from
every
observation
yes
lord
filmar
valmont
mode
of
thinking
is
certainly
very
singular
miss
valmont
father
was
a
most
accomplished
man
and
one
of
my
most
intimate
friends
he
built
a
seat
after
the
italian
manner
tasty
and
elegant
as
you
can
possibly
suppose
he
was
very
fond
of
italy
poor
man
he
died
there
i
wish
i
could
have
prevailed
on
valmont
to
allow
his
niece
a
more
enlarged
education
her
manners
i
think
must
be
constrained
and
ungraceful
but
certainly
as
her
father
brother
valmont
had
a
right
to
claim
the
sole
protection
of
her
person
and
to
bring
her
up
as
he
thought
proper
my
father
paused
and
though
i
could
not
immediately
perceive
the
tendency
of
this
ratiocination
i
was
resolved
not
to
assist
him
and
remained
silent
was
telling
you
lord
filmar
how
much
care
and
pains
i
have
taken
to
redeem
the
elsing
estate
let
me
advise
you
to
leave
off
play
and
to
think
of
settling
yourself
advantageously
would
not
a
beautiful
bride
adorn
the
title
of
lady
filmar
do
not
perceive
answered
i
the
title
of
filmar
wants
any
other
ornament
than
it
already
possesses
remember
dear
sir
i
am
scarcely
two
and
twenty
now
walter
the
earl
was
not
content
with
the
simple
recollections
i
had
urged
to
him
but
he
began
also
to
remember
my
profusion
my
my
follies
if
you
please
and
my
inadequate
provision
for
them
my
lord
cried
i
pray
inform
me
what
fortune
my
poor
lordship
has
a
right
to
expect
as
an
antidote
for
matrimonial
poison
think
replied
my
father
a
lady
of
honourable
descent
of
good
expectations
and
possessing
an
unentailed
six
or
seven
thousand
a
year
would
be
a
very
proper
match
for
you
that
lady
is
miss
valmont
such
thing
no
such
thing
cried
the
earl
almost
starting
from
his
you
dare
lord
filmar
to
assert
that
i
said
so
will
i
not
my
lord
so
far
from
it
i
have
heard
you
repeatedly
declare
she
was
left
wholly
dependent
on
her
uncle
but
why
you
should
then
be
involved
in
the
cares
of
guardianship
or
why
you
should
be
inclined
to
saddle
my
encumbered
estate
with
a
wife
without
a
fortune
i
own
appears
a
little
mysterious
be
the
true
state
of
the
case
what
it
may
and
we
will
talk
of
that
hereafter
is
certain
that
every
working
muscle
of
the
countenance
betrayed
the
insincerity
of
his
assertions
while
he
point
blank
denied
that
he
had
any
reference
to
valmont
niece
when
he
proposed
giving
me
a
bride
i
affected
to
be
convinced
and
with
a
kind
of
lazy
curiosity
played
with
my
dog
and
asked
questions
about
miss
valmont
and
wound
my
father
round
and
round
this
dependent
orphan
till
i
was
nearly
as
assured
as
though
it
were
on
lawyer
deeds
before
me
that
six
or
seven
thousand
pounds
a
year
is
the
lady
marriage
portion
a
saucy
triumphant
smile
at
length
betrayed
me
the
earl
reddened
violently
and
degenerated
into
such
hints
about
certain
affairs
of
mine
that
i
suddenly
jumped
up
said
i
would
attend
him
wherever
he
pleased
wished
his
lordship
a
hasty
good
morning
and
drove
away
to
deposit
my
burthen
of
confidence
with
you
well
then
walter
here
we
are
at
monkton
hall
and
valmont
frowning
fortress
stands
only
at
three
miles
distance
but
still
i
am
not
one
foot
forwarder
in
the
direct
road
of
knowing
why
we
came
hither
in
the
of
windings
and
inuendo
indeed
i
have
made
a
little
progress
i
have
discovered
walter
that
the
earl
has
a
secret
but
have
not
discovered
the
actual
secret
only
i
can
surmise
a
great
deal
i
surmise
that
the
earl
and
valmont
have
laid
a
trap
for
me
and
i
surmise
that
i
shall
tumble
into
the
trap
and
be
almost
smothered
with
gold
and
i
further
surmise
that
the
gold
will
infallibly
find
its
way
out
of
the
trap
and
leave
poor
me
behind
it
i
am
resolved
to
be
perfectly
obedient
and
resigned
to
my
fate
and
you
may
if
you
please
wish
me
joy
for
if
the
dear
creature
is
but
any
thing
like
what
her
uncle
intended
to
make
her
with
his
principles
about
female
weakness
and
female
obedience
i
shall
be
the
least
noosed
of
any
married
man
in
england
she
will
want
no
more
than
a
cage
and
a
closet
and
one
smile
a
month
from
her
sovereign
lord
and
master
gloomy
hall
or
gloomy
castle
some
such
name
i
formerly
gave
that
oh
the
profaner
why
it
is
paradise
the
court
of
cytherea
where
loves
and
graces
sport
on
sideboards
of
massive
plate
and
intrigue
with
wanton
zephyrs
upon
every
acre
of
rich
domain
we
are
invited
to
dinner
walter
this
is
saturday
on
tuesday
down
go
the
draw
bridges
to
admit
me
me
me
the
and
earl
settle
preliminaries
the
is
introduced
she
gazes
with
awe
and
astonishment
on
her
polished
lover
while
i
forget
her
to
remember
her
fortune
at
some
future
period
i
shall
subscribe
myself
your
very
rich
and
happy
humble
servant
filmar
letter
viii
from
sibella
valmont
to
caroline
ashburn
imagine
me
dear
caroline
sitting
down
to
write
to
you
in
the
dead
of
night
by
an
almost
extinguished
taper
somewhat
chilled
with
cold
yet
that
sensation
overpowered
by
the
tremor
of
surprise
of
curiosity
of
emotions
in
fine
which
i
can
not
describe
or
explain
and
shall
i
boast
of
my
strength
yet
suffer
my
heart
to
palpitate
the
colour
to
vary
on
my
cheek
because
an
incident
appears
extraordinary
why
did
i
not
go
back
perhaps
imagination
was
on
the
stretch
and
i
am
yet
this
writing
there
must
but
who
would
or
could
sigh
with
or
for
me
save
one
foolish
weak
sibella
art
thou
turned
coward
then
how
thou
brave
dangers
who
hast
fled
from
a
sound
perchance
a
fancied
sound
too
yes
i
will
return
i
will
not
wait
till
renews
my
courage
but
go
now
to
the
wood
and
examine
this
hark
i
hear
a
noise
good
god
is
it
if
it
should
be
my
clem
oh
no
that
is
impossible
it
was
only
the
sweeping
of
the
wind
through
that
long
gallery
but
i
wo
go
to
the
wood
caroline
i
tremble
more
and
the
cold
increases
my
taper
too
diminishes
fast
but
while
its
light
allows
me
i
will
go
over
the
events
of
the
day
and
night
to
discover
if
distinct
recollection
gives
them
a
different
appearance
from
what
they
now
wear
in
the
confusion
of
my
ideas
to
begin
then
with
the
morning
while
yet
at
breakfast
andrew
entered
my
room
and
intimated
it
was
my
uncle
orders
that
i
should
remain
in
my
own
appartments
all
strange
as
appeared
the
command
i
sought
no
explanation
from
andrew
but
chose
rather
to
submit
to
it
in
its
present
form
than
encounter
the
teazing
unintelligible
signs
of
this
silent
old
man
an
hour
had
hardly
passed
when
i
heard
footstep
in
the
gallery
and
as
he
approached
nearer
my
door
i
called
up
a
firmness
in
my
mien
for
methought
his
visit
to
my
chamber
a
circumstance
i
never
remembered
to
have
taken
place
foreboded
something
uncouth
and
unpleasant
sibella
said
he
entering
in
a
cheerful
manner
look
quite
well
you
will
oblige
me
particularly
by
not
going
into
the
park
there
the
armoury
if
you
want
exercise
only
be
sure
you
go
and
return
by
the
narrow
i
would
not
have
you
seen
for
a
moment
in
any
other
part
of
the
castle
perhaps
i
may
bring
a
friend
to
visit
you
a
friend
of
your
father
child
you
obey
me
sibella
and
andrew
can
inform
you
when
you
are
at
liberty
to
pursue
your
rambles
he
withdrew
an
address
so
familiar
with
a
voice
and
countenance
so
complacent
from
valmont
to
me
was
food
for
reflection
the
friend
too
the
friend
of
my
father
i
felt
not
the
necessity
of
exercise
i
approached
not
the
narrow
i
thought
not
of
the
armoury
i
remained
in
one
posture
and
andrew
entrance
with
my
dinner
first
broke
in
upon
my
reverie
the
meal
ended
and
andrew
gone
it
was
resumed
and
as
long
thinking
will
ever
bring
something
home
to
the
affections
i
had
left
valmont
his
smiles
and
his
friend
to
dwell
on
the
image
of
my
clement
when
my
uncle
led
into
the
room
a
man
somewhat
older
in
appearance
than
himself
of
an
unmeaning
countenance
whose
profusion
of
dress
sat
heavy
on
an
insignificant
form
i
turned
away
scornfully
for
i
thought
it
a
profanation
of
the
term
to
call
this
being
friend
of
my
how
long
he
staid
i
can
not
exactly
tell
too
long
i
thought
then
he
seemed
to
talk
of
me
to
valmont
but
to
me
he
said
little
and
owing
perhaps
to
my
dislike
of
the
man
that
little
i
did
not
rightly
understand
and
never
attempted
to
answer
when
i
saw
andrew
in
the
evening
i
ventured
a
few
questions
and
with
difficulty
learned
there
was
company
in
the
castle
who
were
not
expected
to
go
away
till
late
i
desired
him
to
inform
me
as
soon
as
they
had
departed
and
accordingly
a
little
before
twelve
andrew
opened
my
door
gave
three
distinct
nods
shut
it
after
him
and
departed
i
understood
his
signal
never
had
i
passed
a
day
in
the
house
before
and
i
almost
panted
for
the
enjoyment
of
fresh
air
the
night
was
calm
and
serene
and
the
moon
shone
with
a
frosty
brightness
in
a
clear
unclouded
sky
wrapping
myself
in
a
cloak
i
descended
with
a
quick
and
joyful
step
neither
light
nor
sound
existed
in
the
castle
and
unbarring
the
heavy
doors
i
sallied
out
in
defiance
of
cold
to
enjoy
the
lightness
i
then
felt
at
my
heart
the
moonbeam
directed
my
course
and
i
turned
up
the
hill
at
the
back
part
of
the
castle
where
no
trees
intercepted
the
partial
light
standing
on
the
summit
i
looked
around
and
my
eye
caught
the
glittering
surface
made
resplendent
by
the
moon
reflection
of
that
small
and
beautiful
lake
which
you
may
remember
rises
on
the
skirts
of
my
wood
thither
i
hastened
and
seated
on
the
bank
i
became
enraptured
with
the
scene
all
seemed
in
union
with
my
mind
only
that
an
undisturbed
serenity
reigned
through
nature
and
with
the
peace
in
my
breast
a
tumult
of
delight
claimed
its
share
i
sang
i
gave
vent
to
my
pleasure
in
words
in
exclamations
till
at
length
the
sound
of
two
from
some
very
distant
bell
floated
through
the
air
and
i
rose
to
regain
the
castle
never
in
day
time
did
i
quit
the
park
without
visiting
our
oak
and
now
when
my
heart
bounded
high
with
hope
and
pleasure
it
would
have
been
impious
thus
to
have
departed
as
i
passed
the
rock
its
dark
shade
with
the
gloom
in
which
the
tall
trees
inclosed
me
gave
a
new
colour
to
my
emotions
a
pensive
but
not
a
painful
tenderness
stole
on
me
my
breast
began
to
heave
my
lip
to
tremble
and
having
reached
the
oak
i
threw
myself
on
the
ground
and
sobbed
still
i
felt
no
unhappiness
an
impressive
kind
of
awe
took
place
of
my
former
rapture
and
dictated
that
i
should
dry
my
tears
and
offer
up
a
prayer
for
clement
at
the
foot
of
our
oak
i
knelt
and
audibly
prayed
still
was
i
kneeling
still
were
my
clasped
hands
raised
i
uttered
a
deep
sigh
and
close
behind
me
reverberated
a
prolonged
sigh
if
possible
more
deep
more
forcible
my
taper
emits
its
last
rays
the
moon
is
withdrawn
and
total
darkness
compels
me
to
seek
rest
adieu
the
sigh
was
distinct
it
struck
upon
my
ear
it
almost
reached
my
heart
caroline
dizzy
benumbed
i
could
scarcely
rise
and
as
i
walked
slowly
along
the
open
path
from
the
monument
i
really
tottered
i
believe
i
had
proceeded
fifty
yards
and
i
began
to
tread
with
firmness
and
to
consider
if
the
sound
could
be
real
when
something
whizzed
past
me
and
i
perceived
a
little
white
ball
fall
to
the
ground
and
roll
back
as
it
was
on
the
descent
till
it
stopped
at
my
feet
equally
surprised
but
less
affected
i
turned
quickly
round
i
looked
every
way
but
the
rock
the
trees
the
monument
and
their
respective
yet
mingling
shadows
were
the
only
objects
i
could
discern
i
do
not
remember
stooping
for
the
ball
yet
i
felt
it
in
my
hand
as
i
returned
to
the
castle
i
had
left
my
light
burning
in
the
hall
but
did
not
attempt
to
examine
my
possession
till
i
had
shut
myself
in
my
own
chamber
the
ball
consisted
of
several
folds
of
paper
with
a
small
pebble
in
the
middle
to
give
it
weight
i
suppose
the
inner
fold
contained
lines
written
with
a
pencil
the
character
neat
but
uneven
and
in
places
scarcely
legible
these
were
the
contents
thou
instructed
beauteous
nymph
that
those
planets
to
which
thou
now
liftest
thine
eyes
contain
worlds
whose
myriads
of
inhabitants
differ
in
their
degrees
of
perfection
according
to
the
orb
to
which
they
belong
some
approach
to
immortality
others
are
as
yet
farther
removed
but
all
are
in
a
progressive
state
toward
the
angelic
nature
even
the
lowest
orb
ranks
above
thy
world
one
of
these
latter
planets
i
descend
part
mortal
and
part
etherial
the
former
subjects
me
to
pain
and
grief
but
the
latter
can
exalt
me
to
bliss
too
ecstatic
for
the
confined
sense
of
mere
my
spiritual
nature
places
few
bounds
to
my
wishes
gives
me
invisibility
and
brings
the
world
before
me
at
a
view
i
can
see
into
the
human
bosom
and
art
can
not
baffle
me
in
this
world
i
am
permitted
to
seek
a
friend
and
thee
hallowed
inhabitant
of
this
lower
orb
i
claim
thy
desires
before
thee
if
they
be
many
chose
the
essential
if
they
be
few
name
all
after
sunset
place
the
paper
wherein
thou
hast
written
thy
wishes
on
the
tomb
and
retire
if
another
mortal
claim
a
share
of
those
wishes
my
power
ceases
but
if
they
relate
only
to
thyself
fair
creature
some
one
i
may
gratify
thus
may
we
communicate
to
approach
is
forbidden
to
be
visible
to
thy
eyes
is
denied
me
fly
not
then
from
the
spirit
which
protect
but
can
not
harm
thee
whither
does
recollection
bear
you
caroline
to
the
hermit
of
the
wood
and
armoury
doubtless
the
mysterious
and
whimsical
stile
of
this
written
paper
corresponds
with
the
first
address
of
that
hermit
i
wonder
i
did
not
remember
it
last
night
but
clement
fears
and
the
mode
to
overcome
them
have
been
objects
of
such
magnitude
in
the
heart
of
sibella
that
curiosity
has
ceased
to
intrude
its
train
of
remembrances
and
suppositions
clement
was
right
who
but
through
my
uncle
means
could
find
entrance
into
this
region
of
caution
and
confinement
yes
clement
judged
rightly
it
is
the
man
to
whom
valmont
says
i
must
be
united
will
you
caroline
give
the
inclosed
to
my
clement
read
it
also
and
judge
with
him
for
me
i
wait
your
decision
but
i
wait
unwillingly
sibella
letter
ix
to
clement
montgomery
inclosed
in
the
preceding
do
we
not
create
our
own
misery
my
clement
by
this
submission
mr
valmont
separates
our
persons
because
he
can
not
separate
our
hearts
oh
your
reasonings
were
false
my
love
and
i
was
only
misled
when
i
thought
i
was
convinced
a
short
time
you
said
valmont
shall
know
it
all
and
we
will
be
again
united
why
not
now
i
can
not
feel
i
can
not
understand
these
effects
of
his
displeasure
on
which
you
dwell
why
do
you
dream
of
future
benefits
when
he
tells
you
that
you
are
to
have
none
of
them
when
he
declares
to
you
his
wealth
shall
not
be
your
and
what
of
that
will
joy
and
felicity
be
less
ours
because
we
are
not
rich
we
know
it
can
not
did
you
possess
wealth
beyond
what
i
can
name
i
should
share
its
advantages
then
if
poverty
or
disgrace
be
your
i
demand
to
participate
therein
it
is
my
right
and
twenty
valmonts
shall
not
deprive
of
the
inestimable
privilege
let
me
prove
by
actions
the
boundless
love
i
bear
you
words
are
feeble
where
is
the
language
that
has
energy
enough
to
describe
the
crowd
of
pleasures
which
rush
upon
my
mind
while
i
am
retracing
our
past
scenes
of
happiness
or
that
can
give
its
true
colouring
to
my
regret
when
i
call
up
the
present
separation
which
bids
them
depart
for
a
season
clement
you
are
dismissed
that
another
may
be
introduced
the
man
of
mystery
he
whom
my
uncle
has
chosen
appears
again
say
my
love
shall
i
tell
them
how
useless
are
all
their
preparations
that
you
and
i
have
formed
the
indissoluble
band
i
am
ready
to
do
this
i
wait
but
your
consent
and
then
if
valmont
resents
our
conduct
and
will
not
yield
me
to
you
and
your
freedom
i
must
and
shall
find
means
to
show
him
he
has
no
more
power
over
my
person
than
my
mind
i
will
escape
him
and
fly
to
thee
ever
ever
thy
sibella
letter
x
from
lord
filmar
to
sir
walter
boyer
peaceful
slumbers
attend
thee
wat
the
richer
promising
waking
visions
of
expectation
be
mine
a
very
pretty
apostrophe
that
for
a
young
viscount
i
wonder
if
my
father
ever
forgot
to
go
to
sleep
when
in
bed
and
sprang
up
again
to
write
to
some
contemporary
in
same
of
his
stratagems
intrigues
and
toils
dear
honest
soul
no
his
sonorous
breathings
from
the
next
chamber
salute
my
ears
in
i
certainly
never
was
intended
for
the
elder
son
of
an
earl
oh
i
cry
you
mercy
dame
nature
i
read
i
bow
my
head
in
obedience
a
little
twinkling
star
boyer
darting
his
ray
throw
the
window
traces
my
destiny
on
this
paper
the
heyday
of
the
blood
is
says
the
oracle
art
to
be
a
so
i
will
yes
a
prime
minister
of
great
britain
and
the
more
mischief
i
do
the
better
shall
i
be
qualified
for
the
duties
of
that
high
and
important
station
the
project
i
talked
of
in
my
last
have
you
not
admired
its
tendency
have
you
not
rejoiced
that
the
honours
of
the
elsing
title
is
to
have
a
fresh
gilding
from
the
valmont
coffers
if
you
have
not
already
done
this
i
charge
you
neglect
not
a
moment
the
duties
of
congratulation
for
your
friend
your
happy
friend
filmar
is
assuredly
mind
me
to
be
the
husband
of
miss
valmont
therefore
i
will
read
you
a
letter
or
at
least
a
part
of
a
letter
which
came
from
her
uncle
to
my
father
my
lord
to
pursue
this
subject
a
little
farther
it
is
only
with
a
man
who
is
prepared
by
such
opinions
as
i
have
laid
down
to
keep
his
wife
in
seclusion
that
sibella
valmont
can
be
happy
i
have
purposely
educated
her
to
be
the
tractable
and
obedient
companion
of
a
husband
who
from
early
disappointment
and
a
just
detestation
of
the
miserable
state
of
society
is
willing
to
abandon
the
world
entirely
and
not
to
mislead
you
in
any
way
such
a
one
i
hold
in
view
my
lord
have
acted
with
consistent
delicacy
throughout
our
guardianship
you
readily
yielded
to
my
plans
when
our
trust
commenced
and
you
have
never
attempted
to
counteract
them
by
any
interference
and
i
am
therefore
beholden
to
your
prudence
and
politeness
of
your
lordship
understanding
i
have
so
good
an
opinion
that
i
can
not
apprehend
any
offence
will
be
taken
on
your
part
for
my
declining
the
proposed
alliance
of
lord
filmar
for
my
niece
you
must
be
aware
my
lord
how
very
unfit
her
education
has
rendered
her
to
be
the
wife
of
any
person
who
does
not
in
all
respects
think
as
i
do
you
must
also
suffer
me
to
decline
for
very
good
reasons
your
request
that
lord
filmar
may
see
her
the
child
has
beauty
and
the
interview
for
his
sake
is
much
better
avoided
you
my
lord
have
a
title
to
see
her
whenever
you
are
so
disposed
and
i
hope
as
a
proof
that
we
understand
each
other
that
lord
filmar
will
accompany
you
when
you
honour
valmont
castle
with
your
visits
from
your
friend
and
servant
this
letter
walter
the
earl
called
me
back
to
give
me
at
his
own
chamber
door
after
i
had
bade
him
good
night
do
you
not
observe
how
artfully
valmont
had
arranged
the
manner
of
his
refusal
or
are
you
as
i
was
on
its
first
perusal
a
little
chilled
by
the
contents
i
perceive
by
the
earl
delivering
the
letter
to
me
at
a
time
which
precluded
all
conversation
on
the
subject
that
he
feels
refusal
to
be
unchangeable
now
i
dare
not
tell
him
that
i
have
boldly
resolved
to
take
the
niece
of
valmont
whether
her
uncle
pleases
or
not
because
what
he
calls
his
honour
would
stand
between
me
and
my
project
honour
will
not
pay
my
debts
walter
so
here
you
and
i
part
good
by
to
you
there
we
have
shaken
hands
and
the
musty
fellow
has
marched
off
on
yon
straight
road
while
i
turn
aside
into
this
invention
aid
me
stratagem
be
my
guide
and
do
thou
walter
plot
contrive
and
assist
to
make
me
matter
of
this
prize
assuredly
i
will
be
the
husband
of
miss
valmont
this
have
i
sworn
to
myself
and
this
have
i
repeated
to
you
i
read
valmont
freezing
epistle
and
i
went
to
bed
darkness
and
silence
are
admirable
auxiliaries
to
reflection
first
past
in
array
before
me
my
mortgages
my
debts
and
the
diabolical
stake
i
lost
to
spellman
for
which
i
have
given
notes
that
extend
to
the
uttermost
penny
i
can
raise
then
how
gaily
danced
before
me
the
visions
i
had
indulged
while
i
sounded
my
father
about
this
hidden
fortune
of
miss
valmont
and
while
i
reflected
on
the
wealth
of
her
uncle
but
said
i
uncle
has
refused
me
has
already
selected
a
husband
for
her
and
i
shut
my
eyes
and
sighed
walter
that
sigh
proved
my
salvation
for
it
exhaled
the
dim
vapour
that
had
obstructed
the
operations
of
my
confidence
my
invention
then
how
rapidly
did
my
fancy
teem
with
plan
and
project
how
did
i
reject
one
choose
another
till
at
length
i
called
for
light
and
paper
that
i
might
cool
the
fever
of
my
hopes
by
laying
them
bare
to
your
inspection
i
well
know
what
you
are
walter
a
compound
of
contradictions
when
you
should
believe
you
are
sceptical
where
you
should
doubt
your
faith
is
unshaken
and
i
expect
when
i
tell
you
i
am
more
and
more
convinced
by
the
recollection
of
many
circumstances
and
by
the
earl
awkward
evasions
that
miss
valmont
is
her
father
heiress
i
expect
i
say
that
you
will
assure
me
i
am
deceived
and
as
to
my
resolution
of
stealing
her
you
will
assert
that
it
is
a
project
idle
vain
and
impracticable
yet
were
i
now
to
abandon
the
enterprise
you
would
wonder
at
my
stupidity
would
declare
nothing
could
appear
so
certain
as
her
fortune
and
nothing
so
easy
as
its
attainment
therefore
dear
walter
i
do
not
ask
your
advice
i
only
ask
your
attention
six
or
seven
thousand
a
year
the
lady
a
minor
too
from
the
age
of
six
and
no
expences
incurred
upon
her
education
think
of
these
circumstances
walter
and
if
you
love
arithmetic
cast
up
the
accumulations
of
all
these
years
and
to
make
the
sum
total
of
my
future
possessions
add
the
per
ann
of
her
uncle
who
never
had
any
other
heir
than
this
untutored
sibella
would
not
such
a
sum
convert
even
deformity
into
grace
but
they
say
too
she
has
beauty
her
ignorance
and
barbarism
i
will
forgive
for
i
can
at
all
times
escape
from
a
wife
though
i
can
not
escape
from
the
debts
which
are
hourly
accumulating
to
my
destruction
marry
a
fortune
or
fly
my
country
there
the
alternative
i
choose
the
former
as
to
flying
one
country
i
know
of
no
country
in
which
a
man
may
drink
game
and
spend
his
own
and
other
people
money
so
easily
as
in
that
where
being
born
rather
of
one
parent
than
another
the
delightful
privilege
becomes
as
it
were
part
of
his
legal
inheritance
it
must
be
done
too
if
possible
time
enough
to
prevent
the
necessity
of
a
last
mortgage
to
pay
the
notes
i
gave
to
spellman
i
was
bubbled
out
of
that
money
but
i
was
heated
and
the
rascal
so
cool
i
was
unable
to
detect
him
it
becomes
therefore
a
debt
of
honour
and
someway
or
other
pay
i
must
pshaw
walter
thou
wert
always
a
dunce
at
school
and
at
college
now
art
thou
turning
over
the
page
to
seek
the
parting
scene
me
and
honour
foolish
fellow
didst
thou
never
hear
there
are
two
sorts
of
honour
honour
of
principle
and
honour
of
fashion
honour
of
principle
says
not
steal
miss
valmont
out
of
her
castle
and
pay
thy
poor
tradesmen
before
thou
payest
the
gambler
spellman
here
advances
honour
of
fashion
what
grace
what
ease
in
her
attitudes
how
unlike
is
she
to
the
awkward
fellow
who
has
just
spoken
and
who
without
one
bow
one
smile
stood
as
upright
as
if
he
dared
show
his
face
to
the
gods
but
hark
her
mellifluous
accents
steal
upon
mine
ear
says
she
accomplished
nobleman
for
which
nature
in
her
happiest
mood
designed
you
exercise
the
elegance
of
your
taste
in
the
disposal
of
miss
valmont
wealth
above
all
pay
spellman
or
you
forego
among
the
higher
circles
the
rapture
of
staking
thousands
on
the
cast
of
a
die
it
would
be
strange
if
a
young
man
of
my
accomplishments
did
not
know
how
much
more
useful
and
endearing
a
companion
is
honour
of
fashion
than
honour
of
principle
i
will
go
and
drink
one
bumper
to
the
little
solitary
then
i
go
dream
aye
i
dream
that
we
are
married
for
i
am
upon
honour
there
too
adieu
filmar
since
i
wrote
the
above
i
have
given
four
hours
to
deliberation
on
the
chances
for
and
against
my
design
nor
have
i
found
any
obstacle
which
may
not
be
overcome
though
i
have
not
yet
discovered
the
means
do
not
laugh
at
me
for
i
think
it
no
inconsiderable
step
toward
success
to
have
divined
all
the
probabilities
which
may
oppose
my
success
i
go
to
the
castle
griffiths
shall
attend
me
he
was
once
your
valet
too
need
i
a
more
skilful
engineer
think
you
who
knows
what
opportunities
may
occur
a
sigh
a
glance
a
word
oh
but
i
forget
i
am
not
even
to
look
at
her
says
don
distance
well
well
we
will
talk
of
that
hereafter
twice
have
i
perambulated
around
the
park
but
it
is
so
walled
and
wooded
and
moated
that
the
great
mogul
army
and
elephants
might
be
there
invisible
a
propos
in
the
second
of
these
circuits
which
was
on
yesterday
evening
as
i
was
leading
my
horse
down
a
hill
at
the
bottom
of
which
valmont
moat
forms
a
sudden
angle
i
perceived
a
young
man
walking
hastily
up
the
narrow
lane
towards
the
moat
hearing
my
horse
feet
he
turned
towards
me
then
wheeling
round
he
fled
out
of
sight
in
a
moment
in
one
hand
he
held
a
long
pole
and
in
the
other
a
small
basket
his
figure
was
uncommonly
elegant
and
i
imagined
i
had
some
knowledge
of
him
but
there
are
no
gentlemen
houses
in
this
quarter
except
the
castle
and
monckton
hall
the
little
valley
where
i
saw
him
is
unfrequented
and
scarcely
passable
it
is
so
encumbered
with
brambles
and
underwood
woods
rise
immediately
on
the
other
side
of
the
moat
whose
shade
with
that
of
the
high
barren
and
black
which
shows
its
rugged
side
to
the
valley
spreads
forbidding
gloom
over
the
whole
who
could
this
youth
be
i
wonder
and
where
could
he
be
going
adieu
walter
think
of
letter
xi
from
caroline
ashburn
to
sibella
valmont
i
charge
you
sibella
by
the
value
you
affix
to
my
friendship
that
you
remain
at
present
passive
it
is
a
term
of
probation
for
clement
on
which
the
colouring
of
your
future
days
more
of
this
hereafter
i
write
now
with
a
kind
of
restless
eagerness
images
apprehensions
and
even
hopes
all
finally
resting
on
you
fill
the
place
of
soberer
this
wood
wanderer
this
spirit
mortal
and
part
etherial
fascinates
my
attention
i
see
him
gliding
through
the
paths
you
had
trodden
the
tree
which
screened
him
from
your
view
can
not
conceal
him
from
mine
i
see
him
listen
almost
breathless
to
your
prayer
the
colour
on
his
cheek
hangs
trembling
daring
not
then
to
depart
and
the
throbbings
of
his
agonized
bosom
collect
themselves
while
restrained
and
give
force
to
that
sign
whose
utterance
has
echoed
a
thousand
times
in
my
imagination
i
see
him
dart
the
ball
forward
to
meet
your
feet
and
then
he
rushes
into
the
thickest
gloom
to
hide
himself
if
possible
even
from
himself
this
is
no
spirit
of
your
uncle
choosing
sibella
no
it
is
one
who
has
refined
upon
romance
who
can
give
i
perceive
as
much
enthusiasm
to
the
affections
and
carve
misery
for
himself
as
ingeniously
as
though
he
had
passed
his
days
under
the
safeguard
of
valmont
walls
and
will
protect
but
can
not
harm
in
truth
i
believe
it
go
to
the
wood
then
sibella
see
him
if
possible
and
tell
me
did
symmetry
ever
mould
a
statue
in
finer
proportions
than
his
form
can
boast
his
eye
in
its
passive
state
is
a
clear
grey
its
shape
long
and
the
finest
and
that
ever
adorned
mortal
face
not
excepting
even
your
sibella
belong
to
his
hold
him
in
conversation
and
you
will
see
that
eye
almost
emit
fire
it
will
dazzle
you
with
its
rays
or
if
a
softer
subject
engage
him
it
can
speak
so
submissively
to
the
heart
that
words
become
but
the
secondary
medium
of
his
theme
observe
how
his
hair
bursting
from
confinement
into
natural
ringlets
around
his
temples
contrasts
itself
with
the
fairness
of
his
complexion
fair
without
effeminacy
his
colour
is
of
a
doubtful
kind
for
it
retires
as
you
perceive
it
or
suffuses
the
whole
of
his
fine
countenance
just
as
you
had
begun
to
lament
that
he
was
too
pale
his
nose
and
mouth
though
somewhat
large
and
perhaps
irregular
yet
admirably
correspond
with
the
harmony
of
the
whole
face
you
probably
will
think
clement
glowing
face
handsomer
i
do
not
chase
but
by
one
smile
and
dissatisfaction
of
your
spirit
and
there
will
a
radiance
if
i
may
so
call
it
beam
upon
you
that
my
best
art
fails
to
delineate
i
shall
not
underwrite
the
name
till
you
have
judged
of
my
painting
cease
your
astonishment
my
friend
for
i
am
no
sorceress
and
the
spright
is
too
etherial
too
imaginative
to
hold
counsel
with
a
mere
mortal
like
me
to
the
means
of
his
being
with
you
i
confess
i
have
no
clue
but
if
you
read
my
former
letters
you
will
perhaps
find
mention
of
some
few
of
the
reasons
and
circumstances
which
incline
me
to
infer
i
have
discovered
him
you
will
find
though
what
i
am
now
about
to
tell
you
for
my
heart
only
transmitted
it
to
my
understanding
where
it
remained
to
have
its
justice
and
propriety
closely
yes
sibella
wild
variable
and
inconsistent
as
is
this
spirit
of
your
woods
could
have
loved
him
if
would
have
let
but
is
past
was
a
trace
on
the
sands
love
shall
never
write
its
lasting
characters
on
my
mind
till
my
reason
invites
it
and
where
hopes
rests
not
reason
can
not
abide
clement
eagerness
to
cultivate
our
acquaintance
is
by
no
means
flattering
i
have
known
him
but
a
week
it
was
at
the
opera
that
i
observed
laundy
eye
stealing
to
the
adjoining
box
with
something
more
than
mere
inquisitiveness
mine
followed
a
party
of
young
men
occupied
the
box
all
known
to
me
except
one
and
from
the
position
in
which
the
stranger
sat
neither
laundy
nor
i
could
gain
more
than
an
oblique
view
of
his
face
now
i
do
acknowledge
that
even
this
oblique
view
gave
promise
of
the
whole
being
worthy
of
observation
yet
my
curiosity
lulled
itself
to
repose
till
the
dutchess
de
n
constantly
of
our
parties
arose
at
the
end
of
another
act
to
gaze
around
with
that
confidence
which
women
of
a
certain
rank
deem
infinitely
becoming
in
themselves
though
if
perceived
in
a
shopkeeper
wife
or
daughter
downright
impudence
alone
would
be
called
its
proper
description
screamed
the
dutchess
chevalier
montgomery
clement
for
it
was
your
clement
starting
from
his
former
posture
bowed
hastily
and
having
carelessly
looked
on
the
rest
of
the
party
returned
to
his
seat
poor
i
all
flutter
and
palpitation
eager
to
know
if
this
montgomery
was
the
identical
montgomery
was
almost
in
despair
that
he
should
not
avail
himself
of
the
dutchess
recognition
but
she
was
not
to
be
so
baffled
with
some
trouble
on
account
of
the
nabob
gouty
toe
she
displaced
sir
thomas
and
lady
barlowe
and
got
close
to
the
box
already
had
she
raised
her
fan
to
accost
him
with
the
tap
of
familiarity
when
i
heard
hanway
his
companion
say
and
miss
ashburn
eye
instantly
met
mine
a
smile
gathered
round
his
mouth
and
in
two
seconds
he
was
in
our
box
regularly
introduced
by
hanway
for
the
first
minute
i
was
sure
he
resembled
you
in
the
next
the
likeness
became
indistinct
and
in
two
more
i
lost
it
entirely
his
face
with
all
its
advantages
of
complexion
colour
brilliant
eyes
and
exquisite
teeth
has
not
the
variety
which
your
possesses
though
to
say
here
that
he
is
less
handsome
than
any
creature
upon
earth
is
almost
a
crime
and
the
ladies
scruple
as
little
to
tell
him
he
is
a
phoenix
as
to
think
him
one
we
had
scarcely
any
conversation
that
evening
for
my
mother
and
the
dutchess
vied
with
each
other
in
their
attention
to
montgomery
lady
barlowe
could
not
claim
a
share
of
him
though
sir
thomas
immediately
recollected
clement
and
renewed
their
acquaintance
with
apparent
pleasure
you
remember
montgomery
said
the
nabob
day
you
and
arthur
set
out
for
the
continent
you
dined
with
me
how
much
every
body
was
delighted
with
my
nephew
vivacity
that
very
day
a
gentleman
said
to
me
sir
thomas
and
a
very
great
judge
he
was
i
assure
you
sir
thomas
said
he
your
nephew
will
make
a
figure
in
the
world
if
you
bring
him
into
parliament
what
with
his
abilities
and
his
relationship
to
you
sir
thomas
he
may
stand
almost
any
where
in
this
country
well
montgomery
when
i
sent
for
him
home
so
much
sooner
than
i
first
intended
it
was
because
this
gentleman
advice
appeared
to
me
very
good
and
because
he
further
told
me
no
time
was
to
be
lost
home
arthur
came
and
i
could
have
bought
him
a
borough
the
next
day
indeed
he
said
he
would
neither
buy
votes
or
sell
votes
nor
did
the
conduct
of
parliament
please
him
nor
could
he
in
short
he
had
so
many
faults
to
find
and
objections
to
make
that
he
me
and
i
could
tell
what
to
say
to
him
but
thought
i
he
will
think
better
of
it
and
i
let
the
matter
rest
a
while
and
made
another
proposal
in
the
mean
time
and
had
he
done
as
i
wished
he
would
now
have
been
one
of
the
richest
men
perhaps
in
the
kingdom
yet
upon
my
soul
he
point
blank
refuses
this
too
and
talked
as
much
of
principle
and
integrity
and
i
know
not
what
as
in
case
was
damned
insolent
and
so
i
told
no
nor
had
he
ever
the
modesty
to
ask
my
pardon
but
took
it
all
as
coolly
as
you
can
well
and
when
i
forgave
him
of
my
own
accord
and
behaved
to
him
more
kindly
than
ever
he
has
taken
some
new
freak
into
his
brain
and
playing
so
many
odd
tricks
of
late
that
i
am
actually
afraid
of
him
never
was
such
an
unaccountable
said
lady
barlowe
at
bath
added
my
mother
laughing
letters
are
algebra
to
me
said
clement
i
have
been
half
tempted
to
forswear
his
correspondence
winter
said
hanway
made
conquests
by
dozens
some
cruel
fair
one
is
revenging
i
suppose
her
slighted
in
love
no
doubt
believe
not
replied
clement
and
the
conversation
ended
for
the
dutchess
now
chose
to
talk
and
never
having
seen
this
incomprehensible
irresistible
murden
she
could
not
talk
of
him
you
know
the
party
adjourned
to
sup
at
sir
thomas
barlowe
we
and
the
dutchess
de
n
by
a
previous
engagement
clement
and
hanway
in
consequence
of
the
baronet
pressing
invitations
mademoiselle
laundy
complained
of
indisposition
and
returned
home
immediately
from
the
opera
she
as
well
as
her
friend
the
dutchess
had
been
acquainted
with
clement
in
paris
but
after
the
first
cold
bow
mademoiselle
laundy
remained
unnoticed
by
him
no
man
could
be
more
gallant
more
gay
or
unrestrained
than
your
chevalier
as
the
dutchess
persists
in
calling
him
at
the
nabob
table
we
met
several
persons
of
fashion
to
whom
he
was
already
known
and
by
whom
he
was
treated
with
attention
his
person
and
manners
are
no
trivial
recommendation
and
the
belief
which
every
where
prevails
of
his
being
heir
to
valmont
supports
his
consequence
with
its
due
proportion
of
power
i
debated
with
myself
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
belief
ought
to
pass
without
contradiction
and
foreseeing
many
injurious
consequences
that
might
arise
to
clement
from
the
expences
and
dissipation
which
it
encouraged
i
resolved
to
seek
an
early
opportunity
of
conversing
with
and
encouraging
him
to
disown
the
supposition
no
opportunity
occurred
during
that
evening
but
ere
we
separated
clement
was
engaged
to
dine
on
the
succeeding
day
in
one
of
my
mother
private
parties
i
very
seldom
breakfast
with
my
mother
our
hours
of
rising
and
morning
avocations
are
so
different
however
i
went
to
her
dressing
room
that
morning
purposely
to
talk
of
your
clement
i
spoke
much
of
your
attachment
to
each
other
and
ashburn
immediately
declared
she
would
take
his
constancy
under
her
protection
as
such
elegance
and
accomplishments
she
said
as
those
possessed
by
montgomery
would
be
assailed
with
more
temptation
than
such
charming
candour
and
simplicity
might
be
able
to
withstand
to
miss
laundy
my
mother
appealed
for
her
confirmation
of
clement
praise
and
she
either
did
or
i
fancied
she
did
give
her
assent
with
a
languor
and
inattention
not
usual
to
her
i
had
no
reason
however
to
accuse
her
of
inattention
when
i
hinted
at
the
change
in
clement
expectations
for
although
my
mother
suffered
it
to
pass
unnoticed
mademoiselle
laundy
thought
proper
to
press
questions
on
me
relative
to
this
subject
i
resented
her
inquisitive
curiosity
on
a
point
which
could
not
in
any
way
concern
her
and
declining
to
answer
her
questions
i
quitted
the
room
to
join
private
my
mother
had
invited
clement
that
was
fifteen
visitors
placed
at
a
table
covered
with
the
most
luxurious
delicacies
served
in
gilt
plate
and
surrounded
with
attendants
as
numerous
as
the
company
ashburn
less
splendid
but
more
tasty
than
usual
in
her
dress
and
ornaments
was
studiously
attentive
to
clement
declared
herself
his
guardian
and
spoke
with
rapturous
admiration
of
you
sibella
but
without
naming
you
clement
blushed
bowed
returned
compliment
for
compliment
and
graceful
in
all
his
changes
assumed
an
air
and
mien
of
exultation
sometimes
he
turned
his
eye
toward
mademoiselle
laundy
the
evening
had
far
advanced
before
i
could
engage
him
in
any
conversation
he
then
showed
me
a
letter
from
your
uncle
wherein
to
my
very
great
surprise
valmont
desires
clement
to
be
cautious
in
confiding
his
prospects
or
intentions
to
any
one
bids
him
study
mankind
and
despise
them
tells
him
he
does
not
mean
to
limit
him
to
the
sum
he
has
already
in
his
possession
if
more
should
be
necessary
and
advises
him
to
be
speedy
in
his
choice
of
a
profession
talks
of
the
value
of
disappointment
the
blessings
of
solitude
the
duty
of
obedience
of
his
own
wisdom
his
own
prudence
and
power
begins
with
the
kind
of
appellation
of
dear
adopted
son
concludes
with
the
stern
phrase
of
friend
as
you
conduct
yourself
here
my
interference
ends
henceforward
valmont
plans
and
clement
executes
each
in
his
own
way
your
uncle
has
quite
an
original
genius
sibella
following
no
common
track
he
labours
only
to
make
a
glare
by
strong
opposition
of
colours
and
to
surprise
by
contrariety
of
images
to
clement
murmurs
against
valmont
succeeded
a
little
species
of
delirium
for
i
named
you
and
no
impassioned
epithet
was
omitted
in
the
recital
of
your
whatever
sibella
may
be
my
own
vanity
and
pretensions
i
could
hear
praises
of
your
beauty
from
a
thousand
tongues
without
envy
or
weariness
yet
from
clement
a
slighter
mention
would
have
pleased
me
better
he
is
the
chosen
of
your
heart
and
should
prize
the
mind
you
possess
equal
to
heaven
an
beauty
might
be
forgotten
when
the
present
and
future
contemplation
of
such
a
mind
could
be
brought
in
view
alas
your
lover
is
no
philosopher
he
laments
the
energy
which
i
allow
me
to
indulge
the
percipient
quality
i
suppose
myself
to
possess
and
sketch
montgomery
when
my
messenger
presents
him
the
letter
you
inclosed
to
me
no
sooner
does
he
behold
that
writing
than
sibella
rises
to
his
view
in
all
her
grace
and
loveliness
could
he
give
existence
to
the
vision
that
moment
would
be
too
rich
in
transport
he
trembles
with
an
exquisite
unsatisfied
delight
and
while
the
senseless
paper
receives
his
eager
kisses
he
could
fight
dragons
or
rush
through
fire
to
obtain
at
length
he
well
the
same
sibella
is
there
she
whom
he
calls
the
most
perfect
and
lovely
of
all
creatures
the
same
sibella
whose
enchantments
cast
a
magic
illusion
around
the
woods
of
valmont
the
same
sibella
but
poor
and
dependent
is
now
quitting
those
woods
for
ever
and
ever
she
leaves
behind
her
even
the
trace
of
wealth
and
flies
an
outcast
to
clement
who
involved
in
the
same
ruin
has
neither
fortune
fame
nor
friend
delightful
expectations
vanish
torture
succeeds
and
the
agony
of
this
prospect
to
clement
could
in
no
one
instance
be
equalled
except
perchance
by
the
knowledge
of
your
being
in
the
possession
of
a
rival
and
lost
to
him
for
ever
i
suspect
there
are
some
latent
shades
in
this
picture
which
will
displease
you
but
remember
my
ever
dear
girl
that
early
even
at
the
commencement
of
our
intimacy
we
reciprocally
laid
it
down
as
a
solemn
truth
that
without
full
and
entire
confidence
friendship
is
of
no
value
i
have
said
that
clement
and
you
love
from
habit
nor
let
it
wound
you
that
i
say
so
still
for
i
am
willing
to
seek
conviction
and
though
i
can
not
be
more
candid
than
now
nor
ever
more
worthy
of
your
affection
than
while
i
am
offending
your
heart
to
inform
your
judgment
yet
if
conviction
meet
me
i
shall
be
more
joyful
by
millions
of
degrees
in
owning
i
had
mistaken
at
all
events
whether
clement
approves
or
disapproves
the
intention
your
leaving
your
uncle
and
his
castle
now
would
be
decidedly
wrong
your
education
constantly
in
opposition
to
that
which
a
dependent
should
have
had
unfits
you
for
entering
the
world
without
protection
you
have
so
much
to
learn
of
the
manners
of
society
that
perhaps
any
plan
you
might
form
would
turn
out
the
very
reverse
of
your
stay
patiently
if
you
can
at
any
rate
stay
till
clement
makes
his
final
determination
and
then
i
tell
you
more
of
my
mind
be
happy
my
sweet
my
beloved
friend
you
have
it
largely
in
your
power
and
surely
is
better
to
summons
fortitude
and
walk
boldly
over
a
few
thorns
than
creep
through
miserable
paths
to
avoid
them
or
sit
down
idly
to
bemoan
their
situation
caroline
ashburn
i
have
opened
my
letter
in
consequence
of
a
visit
from
clement
montgomery
he
came
to
me
sibella
agitated
and
trembling
your
letter
had
conjured
up
a
horrible
train
of
fears
and
suppositions
and
he
was
scarcely
assured
the
evil
he
most
dreaded
had
not
already
arrived
cruel
sibella
he
exclaimed
now
perhaps
your
have
for
ever
undone
me
with
mr
valmont
i
reminded
him
that
you
had
said
in
the
concluding
lines
of
your
letter
to
me
that
you
waited
though
unwillingly
for
clement
determination
that
is
true
cried
he
is
my
salvation
dear
miss
ashburn
conjure
her
by
your
love
and
my
own
to
guard
our
secret
faithfully
from
her
uncle
tell
her
she
can
not
judge
of
the
destruction
she
would
hurl
upon
my
head
if
she
were
now
to
betray
me
tell
her
i
intreat
i
insist
that
she
make
not
one
attempt
to
quit
the
will
you
dear
miss
ashburn
undertake
this
kind
office
will
you
turn
the
adorable
romantic
girl
from
her
mad
enterprise
montgomery
i
replied
will
deliver
your
own
message
exactly
in
your
own
words
as
to
my
opinion
i
have
given
it
to
sibella
already
it
is
against
her
quitting
the
castle
i
should
also
have
told
clement
what
were
my
motives
for
wishing
you
to
remain
with
your
uncle
had
not
my
mother
and
mademoiselle
laundy
at
that
instant
entered
the
room
their
presence
however
did
not
prevent
clement
from
thanking
me
with
great
warmth
and
the
worst
of
his
fears
being
now
removed
his
countenance
again
brightened
into
smiles
and
he
readily
acquiesced
in
my
mother
wish
of
his
attending
her
to
convey
him
to
his
lodgings
to
dress
and
as
he
quitted
us
i
bade
him
remember
the
purpose
for
which
he
came
to
london
blushes
covered
his
face
and
he
departed
without
speaking
once
more
adieu
forget
not
the
letter
xii
from
janettea
laundy
to
clement
montgomery
wounded
pride
bids
me
forget
the
cold
cruel
montgomery
but
fatally
for
the
peace
of
janetta
her
love
betrayed
injured
and
neglected
as
it
is
still
is
more
powerful
than
her
pride
i
have
seen
my
family
stripped
of
their
honours
and
possessions
by
a
band
of
ruffians
i
have
been
left
a
destitute
orphan
and
compelled
to
seek
subsistence
in
a
strange
country
compelled
to
descend
even
to
a
species
of
servitude
yet
how
trivial
such
misfortunes
compared
with
the
loss
of
thee
montgomery
how
could
you
leave
me
unjustified
and
unheard
how
could
you
meet
me
as
you
did
this
night
do
you
never
remember
montgomery
the
sacrifices
made
to
you
by
the
undone
janetta
do
you
never
remember
the
hours
of
your
solicitations
vows
and
promises
and
if
you
do
remember
them
can
you
thus
kill
with
scorn
and
aversion
her
who
solicits
your
return
to
your
vows
with
tears
of
passion
love
and
anguish
i
did
not
feign
when
i
pleaded
indisposition
to
excuse
my
attendance
on
ashburn
to
sir
thomas
barlowe
for
which
in
your
presence
and
restrained
by
the
presence
of
others
from
giving
freedom
to
my
emotions
i
suffered
indescribable
torture
what
dangers
do
i
not
incur
by
setting
the
messenger
who
shall
give
you
this
to
watch
your
quitting
the
party
but
you
will
not
montgomery
dear
adored
montgomery
if
you
do
hate
and
despise
me
you
will
not
give
me
up
to
the
contempt
of
others
my
reputation
is
still
sacred
and
but
for
you
the
peace
within
my
bosom
had
now
been
inviolate
i
must
see
you
i
will
see
you
montgomery
do
not
drive
me
to
desperation
i
have
woes
enough
already
let
me
but
once
have
an
interview
to
explain
that
cruel
mistake
of
your
concerning
the
duke
de
n
and
when
i
have
proved
my
innocence
if
you
still
bid
me
languish
under
your
hatred
i
will
then
suffer
in
silence
no
complaint
shall
ever
reach
you
should
you
again
smile
on
me
oh
heavens
the
rapture
of
that
thought
be
assured
i
can
prove
my
innocence
be
assured
you
were
utterly
mistaken
it
was
a
scheme
a
stratagem
for
purposes
i
can
easily
explain
if
you
will
but
give
me
an
interview
the
dutchess
de
n
is
to
this
hour
my
very
best
friend
it
was
she
who
brought
me
to
england
alas
what
a
sad
reverse
of
situation
is
mine
thus
to
sue
with
tears
and
intreaty
for
one
short
hour
conversation
to
him
who
but
a
few
months
past
languished
for
the
slightest
of
my
favours
think
what
a
preference
i
gave
you
over
the
many
who
followed
me
with
their
sighs
think
what
i
was
what
i
have
endured
and
drive
not
to
rage
and
despair
her
who
is
ever
your
and
your
alone
janetta
laundy
letter
xiii
from
the
same
to
the
same
last
night
i
obeyed
the
impulses
of
an
unfortunate
passion
renewed
in
its
utmost
violence
and
weakness
by
the
unexpected
sight
of
you
i
now
obey
the
dictates
of
prudence
and
reflection
and
decline
the
interview
i
last
night
solicited
yes
montgomery
i
see
evidently
that
i
am
sacrificed
to
some
rival
be
it
so
i
am
content
to
resign
you
content
to
endure
this
penance
for
my
past
mistakes
we
will
henceforward
meet
only
as
strangers
i
am
resolved
never
will
i
again
trouble
you
in
any
way
nor
ever
again
yield
to
that
delusion
which
has
brought
upon
me
so
much
misfortune
and
misery
i
have
but
one
request
to
make
and
that
sir
is
a
last
request
remember
that
i
am
friendless
and
dependent
be
generously
silent
you
are
likely
to
be
on
terms
of
intimacy
in
this
family
and
miss
ashburn
is
as
severe
as
penetrating
guard
carefully
a
secret
that
would
ruin
me
in
my
situation
and
every
service
that
gratitude
can
inspire
shall
by
your
from
janetta
laundy
letter
xiv
from
clement
montgomery
to
arthur
murden
valmont
dear
arthur
has
sent
me
to
london
with
in
my
pocket
to
choose
a
profession
not
rash
nor
hasty
in
your
determination
clement
said
he
when
we
parted
with
such
persons
as
have
already
made
their
choice
and
have
from
practice
from
success
or
disappointment
learned
the
exact
value
of
their
several
professions
but
associate
with
them
as
an
independent
man
one
who
seeks
a
variety
of
knowledge
rather
from
inclination
than
necessity
and
under
these
appearances
clement
they
will
court
you
to
receive
their
confidence
even
their
envy
of
your
independence
will
increase
the
freedom
of
their
communications
and
do
you
dream
arthur
that
i
am
practicing
these
grave
maxims
and
hearkening
to
the
jargon
of
law
physic
and
divinity
no
indeed
not
i
the
variety
of
knowledge
i
seek
is
variety
in
pleasures
my
teachers
are
divinities
whose
oracles
more
precious
than
wisdom
can
lead
the
senses
captive
and
enchain
the
will
secret
said
valmont
most
readily
can
i
be
secret
i
would
have
it
remain
a
profound
and
everlasting
secret
never
to
interrupt
the
delicious
enjoyments
which
now
again
hover
within
my
reach
which
i
must
seize
on
i
have
not
the
cold
ability
to
chase
from
me
the
present
smiling
hour
of
offered
delight
because
a
future
hour
may
frown
pleasure
beckons
and
i
follow
i
tread
the
mazy
round
of
her
varieties
youth
vigour
and
fancy
conduct
me
to
her
shrine
the
most
indefatigable
of
her
votaries
alike
i
abjure
retrospect
and
foreboding
as
long
as
i
can
find
means
will
i
elude
the
horrible
change
and
if
the
fatal
hour
of
darkness
must
arrive
why
arthur
it
is
but
to
exert
a
little
manhood
it
is
but
to
remember
that
all
the
charms
of
life
are
passed
by
and
boldly
to
plunge
into
everlasting
darkness
imagine
not
dear
arthur
by
that
doleful
conclusion
that
i
at
all
dread
the
possibility
of
its
arrival
for
on
the
contrary
i
believe
my
dismission
is
a
mere
farce
a
something
with
valmont
to
vary
project
and
prolong
inconsistency
i
have
compared
his
letters
and
his
speeches
combined
circumstances
and
find
them
though
so
various
and
contradictory
yet
full
of
hope
and
promise
one
cause
of
dread
indeed
will
assail
me
i
dread
the
rashness
of
sibella
could
you
suppose
murden
that
she
has
even
talked
of
explaining
the
nature
of
our
intimacy
to
her
uncle
and
of
quitting
his
castle
was
ever
any
thing
so
violent
so
absurd
so
pregnant
with
evil
at
this
scheme
when
i
had
read
her
letter
i
thought
every
chair
in
my
apartment
was
stuffed
with
thorns
nay
i
endured
for
a
time
the
torments
of
the
rack
thank
heaven
miss
ashburn
adopted
my
sense
of
the
extravagant
proposition
undertook
to
dissuade
sibella
and
restored
me
once
more
to
gaiety
courage
and
happiness
yes
arthur
established
in
my
former
lodgings
courted
surrounded
congratulated
by
my
former
friends
i
want
but
your
society
and
the
embraces
of
my
divine
girl
to
be
the
happiest
of
the
happy
thanks
murden
for
your
silence
on
the
subject
of
valmont
threatened
disposal
of
me
i
am
every
where
received
like
my
former
self
oh
had
i
met
one
repulsive
look
or
supercilious
brow
with
your
servant
montgomery
i
surely
should
have
run
mad
miss
ashburn
knows
it
all
and
i
hate
her
most
righteously
i
allow
that
she
is
a
fine
woman
but
her
beauty
is
spoiled
by
her
discernment
i
wish
valmont
would
refuse
sibella
miss
ashburn
correspondence
the
dear
girl
is
already
too
eccentric
yet
could
i
now
gaze
on
that
lovely
face
could
i
now
clasp
that
enchanting
unresisting
form
to
my
bosom
had
she
ten
thousand
faults
i
should
swear
they
were
all
perfections
murden
you
never
saw
any
one
who
can
equal
sibella
valmont
her
charms
can
not
pall
in
possession
ever
a
source
of
new
desire
of
fresh
delight
adoration
must
ever
be
her
lover
tribute
arthur
i
will
make
her
my
wife
whom
would
you
suppose
i
have
to
my
very
great
astonishment
found
here
in
ashburn
family
no
other
than
janetta
laundy
i
first
saw
her
at
the
opera
where
i
overlooked
her
with
the
most
studied
neglect
she
quitted
the
party
abruptly
and
then
the
dutchess
de
n
informed
me
of
the
cruel
reverse
of
fortune
in
the
laundy
family
janetta
with
so
much
beauty
she
who
lately
shone
conspicuous
in
fashion
taste
and
elegance
is
now
absolutely
reduced
to
the
mortifying
state
of
a
humble
companion
upon
my
soul
i
was
shocked
and
notwithstanding
certain
recollections
i
could
not
help
feeling
a
strong
degree
of
interest
and
pity
for
her
a
brilliant
party
whom
we
joined
at
the
supper
table
of
your
uncle
sir
thomas
barlowe
banished
janetta
and
her
misfortunes
from
my
thoughts
but
as
i
was
stepping
into
a
chair
to
return
home
after
i
had
handed
the
dutchess
and
ashburn
to
their
carriages
a
man
put
a
letter
into
my
hand
the
letter
was
from
janetta
written
in
the
true
spirit
of
complaint
and
fondness
she
implored
that
i
would
see
her
asserted
her
innocence
with
respect
to
the
duke
de
n
and
recollecting
the
continued
attachment
of
the
dutchess
to
her
i
was
inclined
to
doubt
the
evidence
of
my
senses
and
half
resolved
to
give
her
an
opportunity
of
justifying
herself
again
the
circumstances
came
rushing
into
my
memory
and
brought
conviction
with
them
i
determined
to
contemn
and
despise
her
and
steadily
to
refuse
the
interview
she
spared
me
the
trouble
for
on
the
next
morning
while
i
was
dressing
to
dine
at
ashburn
a
second
letter
was
given
me
in
which
janetta
with
mingled
love
and
resentment
bids
me
a
final
adieu
at
ashburn
table
janetta
laundy
had
no
rival
in
beauty
she
enforced
the
homage
of
many
eyes
but
she
received
it
with
so
graceful
a
reserve
that
those
who
would
otherwise
have
been
jealous
of
her
attractions
were
irresistibly
impelled
to
own
her
worthy
of
admiration
toward
me
her
countenance
expressed
nothing
but
a
frigid
restraint
once
i
approached
her
seat
and
she
found
an
immediate
pretence
for
withdrawing
and
shall
i
confess
it
to
you
arthur
i
was
in
a
small
degree
mortified
it
has
not
been
merely
one
day
or
two
or
three
that
janetta
has
upheld
her
determination
i
have
been
astonished
at
her
inflexibility
and
perseverance
i
have
almost
doubted
that
she
could
really
love
me
and
be
so
firm
scarce
a
day
passes
in
which
we
are
not
together
for
ashburn
is
extravagantly
fond
of
janetta
and
never
moves
without
her
ashburn
selects
her
parties
as
i
best
approve
and
consults
me
on
all
her
engagements
i
attend
her
every
where
and
thus
janetta
and
i
are
frequently
in
the
same
apartment
in
the
same
carriage
side
by
side
and
considering
former
circumstances
you
will
not
imagine
these
can
be
very
desirable
situations
it
occurred
to
me
one
morning
that
i
ought
in
justice
to
make
janetta
a
present
notwithstanding
her
allowance
from
ashburn
is
really
splendid
accordingly
i
sent
her
a
note
inclosed
in
a
letter
written
as
i
think
with
delicacy
and
propriety
the
note
was
accepted
but
the
letter
remained
unanswered
two
evenings
after
this
we
were
at
ranelagh
where
ashburn
joining
the
ulson
family
janetta
and
i
walked
a
round
or
two
alone
she
then
with
more
coldness
than
i
could
have
thought
possible
thanked
me
for
my
present
and
hoped
my
generosity
would
prove
no
inconvenience
under
the
alteration
of
my
affairs
by
heaven
arthur
her
speech
was
a
thunderbolt
i
was
dumb
for
the
space
of
many
minutes
and
then
stammering
incoherent
blushing
with
shame
and
anger
i
protested
her
meaning
was
an
enigma
that
i
could
not
unravel
hanway
at
that
instant
came
up
and
every
opportunity
of
further
conversation
was
at
an
end
and
how
do
you
suppose
i
aimed
to
settle
the
business
to
prevent
the
cruel
supposition
from
being
whispered
from
one
to
another
around
the
circles
of
my
friends
thus
i
did
it
i
took
another
bank
note
of
and
wrote
another
card
in
which
i
alledged
that
i
could
only
understand
mademoiselle
laundy
hint
as
a
reproof
for
the
smallness
of
the
sum
i
had
before
sent
her
and
intreated
she
would
now
receive
this
as
an
atonement
i
acknowledged
the
whole
was
scarcely
worthy
her
acceptance
but
i
hoped
she
would
consider
i
had
less
at
command
than
in
expectation
i
added
my
fervent
wishes
for
her
happiness
but
said
not
one
word
of
love
still
i
have
no
answer
how
wantonly
cruel
it
is
of
miss
ashburn
to
throw
me
thus
in
the
way
of
torment
and
contempt
no
one
but
herself
could
have
told
janetta
of
the
alteration
in
my
affairs
is
false
there
is
no
alteration
for
have
i
not
four
hundred
pounds
in
my
possession
where
are
you
and
what
are
you
doing
arthur
by
heaven
i
never
think
of
you
without
astonishment
you
whom
fortune
favours
you
so
highly
gifted
to
charm
to
be
sacrificing
the
age
of
delights
in
a
barbarous
solitude
what
upon
earth
can
be
your
inducement
your
uncle
pines
for
you
certainly
you
must
be
either
immoderately
sure
of
your
power
over
him
or
desperately
careless
of
your
interest
all
who
concern
themselves
in
your
fate
apply
to
me
for
the
explanation
of
your
mysterious
conduct
and
finding
i
am
no
more
informed
than
themselves
they
teaze
me
with
their
conjectures
come
arthur
come
banish
melancholy
and
misanthropy
till
age
shall
have
cramped
your
vigour
and
palsied
your
faculties
then
cast
your
dim
sight
upon
the
flying
pleasures
which
you
are
no
longer
able
to
pursue
and
rail
and
be
welcome
but
now
while
the
power
is
your
hasten
to
partake
to
enjoy
the
wealth
of
a
nabob
gilds
the
path
before
you
beauty
spreads
her
allurements
for
you
come
insensible
as
you
are
to
the
inticements
of
beauty
at
least
come
to
interest
if
you
can
not
be
interested
excite
the
sigh
the
languor
which
you
will
not
return
be
again
as
formidable
as
you
once
were
and
let
the
meaner
candidates
who
triumph
in
your
absence
sink
back
to
insignificance
and
neglect
does
not
the
prospect
fire
you
i
know
it
does
or
you
are

to

a
devouring
greediness

would
not

i
expected
when
i

lately
written
you
two
letters
upon
the

hopes

me
that
your

innumerable

neither

find

four
sides

castle
accompanied
only
by
my
father

attended
by
griffiths
armed
as
all
outward
points
like
a

for
i
have
gazed
my
fill
yes
on
her
why
look
you
so
walter
am
i
not
her
predestined
lover
and
has
she
not
per
annum
madam
by
what
artist
was
this
portrait
done
said
i
to
valmont
while
the
and
earl
were
gone
to
visit
the
nymph
of
the
south
wing
with
my
imagination
stealing
after
them
on
tiptoe
by
any
artist
sir
replied
the
lady
was
the
performance
of
clement
montgomery
it
is
drawn
for
my
niece
she
must
have
the
honour
greatly
to
resemble
you
madam
upon
my
soul
the
likeness
is
astonishing
up
rose
valmont
indeed
lord
filmar
though
i
never
observed
it
before
there
is
something
of
me
in
the
turn
of
these
features
but
indisposition
sir
the
cruel
hand
of
sickness
has
made
sad
havock
with
my
face
and
she
pushed
a
little
backward
the
hood
which
had
almost
hid
her
remnant
of
beauty
in
short
dear
walter
i
dined
at
the
castle
my
father
saw
the
lady
and
i
saw
her
picture
my
father
says
and
so
says
the
picture
that
she
is
very
handsome
by
the
answers
to
a
few
questions
artfully
arranged
to
valmont
but
more
certainly
from
the
result
of
griffiths
steady
enquiries
among
the
household
i
learn
that
she
is
a
mere
savage
and
loves
her
fellow
savage
clement
as
she
ought
only
to
love
me
loves
her
fellow
savage
clement
you
exclaim
not
less
strange
than
true
walter
and
if
you
would
know
more
listen
as
i
did
to
the
aforementioned
housekeeper
all
the
youths
my
eyes
ever
beheld
said
luxmere
think
master
clement
montgomery
was
the
handsomest
and
so
affable
my
lord
he
used
to
steal
into
my
room
once
or
twice
every
day
to
eat
sweetmeats
when
miss
valmont
or
his
tutor
did
not
watch
him
who
does
this
master
clement
montgomery
belong
to
said
i
valmont
my
lord
i
tell
you
exactly
how
it
was
nobody
as
far
as
i
know
had
ever
heard
of
this
young
gentleman
till
just
after
the
niece
came
to
the
castle
and
then
the
took
a
journey
and
brought
home
with
him
a
fine
handsome
boy
and
he
gave
a
great
entertainment
all
the
rooms
were
filled
with
company
and
after
dinner
he
led
in
clement
montgomery
and
bade
every
body
look
on
him
as
his
adopted
son
some
people
think
indeed
that
he
is
the
luxmere
affected
to
titter
are
of
that
opinion
said
replied
luxmere
can
be
more
certain
old
andrew
has
lived
five
and
twenty
years
with
valmont
and
he
deny
it
beside
if
you
were
to
see
master
clement
my
lord
you
would
swear
it
he
is
so
handsome
and
so
genteel
is
miss
valmont
handsome
and
genteel
and
affable
mrs
luxmere
know
very
little
about
her
my
lord
although
i
lived
in
the
castle
nine
years
said
the
housekeeper
with
much
abatement
of
her
warmth
valmont
ordered
both
her
and
master
clement
not
to
speak
to
any
one
of
the
household
and
she
never
came
into
my
room
in
her
life
master
clement
used
to
come
so
slily
and
many
a
nice
bit
has
he
been
eating
beside
me
when
miss
valmont
has
been
roaming
the
house
and
grounds
in
search
of
him
she
has
a
suite
of
rooms
entirely
to
herself
in
the
south
wing
and
is
waited
on
by
silent
andrew
and
his
deaf
daughter
is
montgomery
now
said
i
dear
my
lord
you
ca
think
what
strange
things
have
happened
to
him
the
sent
him
abroad
and
he
staid
two
years
and
he
came
home
they
say
so
grown
and
so
improved
it
was
charming
to
think
of
it
yet
that
valmont
has
disinherited
him
and
sent
him
to
london
to
work
for
his
bread
poor
dear
youth
i
know
it
true
my
lord
enough
of
luxmere
it
is
true
walter
that
this
dear
and
handsome
youth
was
brought
up
in
the
castle
with
miss
valmont
every
creature
in
it
bears
testimony
to
his
good
nature
for
he
would
not
only
eat
sweetmeats
slily
with
luxmere
but
he
would
slily
ride
with
the
grooms
tell
stories
with
the
butler
and
so
completely
elude
the
vigilance
of
the
and
his
tutor
that
his
contrivances
are
still
a
famous
topic
in
the
servants
hall
not
so
miss
valmont
she
never
tempted
the
domestics
from
their
obedience
nor
invited
them
to
familiarity
by
that
sacrifice
of
her
integrity
i
like
this
part
of
her
character
nor
am
i
at
all
inclined
to
give
credit
to
the
supposition
which
prevails
among
the
servants
of
her
being
deranged
in
intellect
a
little
too
hardy
of
nerve
for
a
countess
i
confess
she
roams
they
tell
me
in
defiance
of
storm
or
tempest
in
the
woods
nay
even
in
the
echoing
galleries
of
the
terrific
castle
at
and
after
midnight
some
say
she
has
conversed
with
apparitions
others
only
fear
that
she
will
one
day
or
other
encounter
them
but
all
agree
that
while
he
was
here
she
adored
clement
and
since
he
has
been
gone
she
to
an
old
oak
for
his
sake
pays
her
adorations
we
talked
of
this
montgomery
yesterday
at
dinner
his
being
disinherited
is
all
stuff
he
is
valmont
idol
valmont
praised
him
to
the
skies
not
what
he
is
but
what
he
is
to
be
when
all
the
plans
respecting
him
shall
be
completed
yet
he
has
faults
it
seems
wonderful
and
cast
in
valmont
mould
too
what
are
his
faults
think
you
boyer
why
he
admires
the
world
lack
a
day
at
one
and
twenty
but
he
is
to
be
cured
of
this
defect
oh
yes
valmont
possesses
the
grand
secret
he
is
to
the
human
race
and
possesses
the
only
specific
in
nature
to
make
a
perfect
man
were
i
in
montgomery
place
i
would
wind
valmont
round
and
round
my
finger
care
i
for
the
nymph
loving
her
clement
think
you
a
whit
did
he
win
her
by
caresses
i
not
be
behind
hand
or
were
sighs
and
flattery
his
engine
i
can
sigh
and
flatter
too
aye
surely
the
filmar
may
stand
a
competitorship
with
valmont
pupil
in
two
months
or
less
she
shall
herself
decide
upon
our
merits
and
acknowledge
me
the
victor
none
of
your
croakings
walter
when
did
i
fail
of
success
where
i
chose
to
attempt
it
even
among
beauties
armed
with
cunning
and
caution
how
then
shall
i
fail
with
this
unadvised
this
inexperienced
damsel
whom
doubtless
a
man
of
less
might
than
i
could
draw
round
the
world
after
him
in
a
cobweb
should
uncle
valmont
rave
when
i
have
secured
the
prize
i
send
him
among
the
tombs
of
my
ancestors
for
consolation
he
loves
family
and
there
he
may
nose
out
a
long
list
of
rotten
heroes
whose
noble
scent
can
inform
him
that
even
the
blood
of
the
valmonts
may
be
enriched
by
uniting
with
the
offspring
of
the
dust
of
the
filmars
my
necessities
are
urgent
walter
the
day
of
sealing
my
last
mortgage
draws
near
and
if
my
invention
is
not
more
fertile
on
that
account
at
least
my
resolution
is
more
undaunted
were
time
less
pressing
i
might
grow
coy
with
expedient
as
it
is
i
must
snatch
at
bare
probabilities
and
in
faith
be
it
the
wildness
of
the
design
be
it
ambition
avarice
or
be
the
motive
what
it
may
i
grow
more
and
more
enamoured
of
the
heiress
of
valmont
castle
and
more
and
more
fearless
of
whatever
risks
i
may
encounter
to
obtain
her
congratulate
me
walter
on
my
firmness
and
believe
me
in
a
very
considerable
degree
thine
filmar
letter
xvi
from
clement
montgomery
to
arthur
murden
i
write
again
and
again
to
you
arthur
and
you
remain
silent
yet
a
fate
so
various
as
mine
makes
even
communication
enjoyment
various
did
i
say
no
it
was
but
my
apprehensions
that
were
various
the
fate
was
certain
established
beyond
the
reach
of
change
valmont
ever
designed
to
make
me
his
heir
and
designs
it
still
yesterday
brought
me
a
welcome
letter
and
a
more
welcome
remittance
am
known
to
be
your
protector
clement
says
valmont
in
his
letter
it
is
necessary
for
my
honour
that
you
should
preserve
a
degree
of
consequence
among
men
moreover
money
is
the
master
key
to
the
confidence
of
men
use
it
as
such
gratify
their
wants
real
or
artificial
and
they
in
return
will
soon
display
the
sordidness
the
ingratitude
of
their
hearts
precious
doctrines
these
and
arthur
i
being
wiser
than
the
sender
have
dismissed
them
to
keep
their
fellow
maxims
company
in
a
close
shut
drawer
in
my
secretary
where
they
shall
rest
in
peace
until
i
turn
snarling
cynic
also
but
the
intimation
arthur
the
cash
arthur
i
have
not
hoarded
those
in
a
drawer
you
hear
that
it
is
necessary
for
valmont
honor
that
i
preserve
consequence
among
men
ah
dear
sir
leave
me
ever
thus
to
the
support
of
your
honor
among
men
i
will
not
complain
though
you
preserve
wholly
to
yourself
the
felicity
of
being
locked
within
the
walls
of
valmont
castle
i
yield
the
building
and
am
content
alone
to
aim
at
preserving
your
honour
and
dignity
with
the
valued
produce
of
its
rich
acres
this
is
the
first
time
that
valmont
letters
to
me
have
failed
to
mention
sibella
heaven
avert
the
omen
if
it
be
one
yet
surely
for
miss
ashburn
advised
and
i
commanded
surely
she
will
be
silent
murden
was
one
of
the
blind
mistakes
of
fortune
that
sibella
and
i
should
love
each
other
directly
in
the
teeth
of
valmont
designs
and
both
so
absolutely
within
his
power
i
have
been
just
taking
a
view
of
her
what
a
divine
face
some
day
i
will
make
another
copy
of
this
miniature
the
hair
beautiful
as
it
is
falls
too
forward
and
hides
the
exquisite
turn
of
her
neck
how
can
i
endure
to
conceal
the
greater
beauty
and
display
the
less
ah
should
those
lips
lips
promising
eternal
sweets
ever
move
to
the
destruction
of
my
hopes
should
they
betray
me
to
valmont
then
arthur
must
they
never
again
give
joy
to
mine
for
however
sibella
wild
energy
might
inspire
me
while
reclined
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
to
vow
this
and
to
promise
that
of
fortitude
and
forbearance
here
in
the
centre
of
delights
i
feel
that
sibella
is
as
much
a
dreamer
as
her
uncle
a
thousand
wants
occur
that
i
knew
not
in
her
arms
wants
which
possibly
her
refinements
might
call
artificial
yet
to
me
is
their
gratification
so
endeared
as
to
become
necessary
to
my
existence
sooner
would
i
quit
life
than
live
unknown
and
unknowing
misled
by
the
power
of
beauty
methought
sibella
spoke
oracles
while
she
talked
to
me
of
contentment
and
independence
whither
might
not
the
thraldom
of
her
enslaving
charms
have
led
me
was
wonderful
i
escaped
ruin
wonderful
that
i
had
strength
to
persevere
in
opposing
her
intent
of
declaring
to
her
uncle
the
secret
of
that
contract
which
crowned
me
with
happiness
while
it
laid
the
foundation
of
a
world
of
fears
could
you
see
her
and
could
you
taste
the
enticements
of
her
caresses
you
would
wonder
too
heavens
how
will
my
happy
years
roll
on
should
i
become
securely
the
inheritor
of
the
valmont
estates
for
then
will
i
reward
my
fairest
then
will
i
make
her
my
wife
oh
that
i
could
find
some
magic
spell
to
charm
her
to
silence
to
deaden
in
her
the
memory
of
the
past
so
that
i
might
peaceably
enjoy
the
present
without
torturing
apprehensions
to
assail
me
of
valmont
discoveries
of
valmont
resentments
but
enough
of
the
name
of
valmont
faith
murden
my
thoughts
are
never
so
near
the
castle
as
when
i
write
to
you
and
the
reason
is
plain
i
fly
to
my
pen
only
when
a
cessation
from
pleasure
threatens
me
with
lassitude
and
to
such
a
cause
i
am
frank
enough
to
tell
you
you
owe
this
my
letter
it
is
now
one
hour
past
noon
and
i
went
to
bed
at
nine
this
morning
my
limbs
acknowledged
a
most
unusual
portion
of
weariness
but
the
gay
shadows
of
the
night
diversions
flitted
before
me
in
tumultuous
rotation
i
had
moments
of
insensibility
on
my
pillow
but
not
of
rest
and
after
making
a
vain
attempt
of
two
hours
to
find
sleep
i
rose
and
ordered
my
breakfast
a
thought
of
writing
to
you
succeeded
for
tempestuous
weather
will
not
let
me
ride
and
haggard
looks
forbid
me
to
visit
ashburn
fortune
must
be
immense
and
on
my
soul
i
adore
her
spirit
she
does
not
suffer
time
to
steal
by
her
unnoticed
nor
wealth
to
sleep
in
her
possession
i
believe
her
very
dreams
are
occupied
in
forming
variety
of
pleasures
their
succession
is
endless
and
perpetual
yesterday
and
last
night
i
made
one
of
a
brilliant
crowd
of
visitors
who
thronged
to
ashburn
her
new
house
was
purposely
prepared
for
this
occasion
and
no
ornament
that
taste
could
devise
and
wealth
approve
was
wanting
to
render
it
complete
in
elegant
a
suite
of
rich
apartments
were
yesterday
morning
thrown
open
for
the
reception
of
near
persons
it
was
a
breakfast
worthy
to
be
recorded
among
the
enchantments
of
a
persian
tale
and
every
mouth
was
filled
with
applause
and
still
would
the
breakfast
and
concert
have
been
the
universal
theme
had
not
the
more
novel
and
splendid
entertainment
of
the
evening
deservedly
claimed
the
superior
praise
ashburn
cards
had
also
invited
the
company
of
the
morning
to
a
masqued
ball
for
the
night
the
masques
began
to
assemble
about
eleven
ashburn
had
laid
her
commands
on
me
not
to
appear
till
i
judged
the
company
would
be
assembled
no
small
tribute
this
her
command
to
the
vanity
of
your
friend
arthur
she
had
chosen
my
habit
she
had
added
to
it
some
brilliant
ornaments
i
will
be
honest
enough
to
confess
that
to
the
utmost
it
displayed
my
advantages
of
person
and
ashburn
believed
the
effect
of
the
whole
would
be
striking
i
represented
a
winged
mercury
my
habit
of
pale
blue
sattin
was
fastened
close
around
me
with
loops
buttons
and
tassels
of
orient
pearls
these
amounting
to
a
value
i
dare
hardly
guess
at
ashburn
absolutely
forced
upon
me
for
the
occasion
thus
resplendent
i
joined
the
throng
buzzing
whispers
of
mercury
the
mercury
splendid
charming
ran
round
the
walls
but
if
the
mercury
excited
their
astonishment
his
own
surprise
and
delight
was
doubly
triply
excited
by
the
enchantments
which
seemed
to
take
his
senses
prisoner
methought
in
the
morning
i
had
quitted
a
palace
what
name
then
could
i
devise
to
express
the
fanciful
grandeur
of
the
present
scene
every
thing
was
new
such
dispositions
had
been
made
that
the
form
of
the
apartments
appeared
changed
how
the
pillars
lights
music
refreshments
were
disposed
you
may
amuse
yourself
if
taste
will
so
far
aid
you
in
imagining
as
for
me
i
have
no
power
of
description
my
brain
whirls
from
one
dazzling
object
to
another
and
leaves
me
but
an
indistinct
crowded
recollection
of
the
various
beauties
ashburn
was
unmasked
janetta
laundy
had
shone
a
bright
star
of
the
morning
but
what
cloud
had
now
dimmed
her
rays
i
could
not
with
the
best
of
my
endeavours
discover
i
detected
the
dutchess
de
d
and
essayed
to
gain
some
tidings
of
the
recreant
star
but
she
laughed
me
off
without
a
tittle
of
information
suddenly
the
bands
of
music
make
an
abrupt
pause
every
one
looks
round
silent
and
surprised
a
pair
of
folding
doors
fly
open
streams
of
light
burst
upon
the
eye
the
rich
perfumes
of
the
east
pour
forth
their
fragrance
to
the
sense
the
altar
of
taste
appears
raised
like
a
throne
at
the
upper
end
of
the
temple
rows
of
silvered
cupids
present
offerings
and
point
to
the
goddess
who
presides
at
her
own
altar
i
knew
her
form
well
was
worthy
of
the

her
robe
fell
gracefully
behind
loose
from
her
shape
which
a
white
vest
sprinkled
with
golden
stars
admirably
fitted
her
plumes
waved
high
over
a
coronet
of
budding

the
half
blown

her

diamond

its
own
inestimable
fairness
in
short
arthur
who
could
look
on
unmoved
was
ashburn
triumph
of
wealth
but
janetta
uncontrollable
triumph
of
beauty
i
have
many
times
wondered
by
what
charm
janetta
could
arrive
at
such
unbounded
influence
over
her
benefactress
for
certainly
ashburn
has
a
plentiful
share
of
vanity
and
is
ever
aiming
to
excite
admiration
how
then
can
she
forgive
the
youth
and
charms
of
her
companion
in
vain
janetta
last
night
assumed
a
double
portion
of
that
cold
haughtiness
of
demeanour
with
which
she
now
receives
my
advances
to
familiarity
she
personated
the
goddess
of
taste
and
men
would
pay
their
loud
and
daring
homage
to
the
divinity
ashburn
became
piqued
she
spoke
pettishly
to
janetta
and
endeavoured
to
disperse
her
admirers
at
length
she
beckoned
me
from
a
distant
seat
to
which
i
had
retired
somewhat
fatigued
and
dispirited
and
delivered
the
goddess
to
my
protection
we
danced
together
we
did
not
separate
during
the
rest
of
the
entertainment
is
as
it
used
to
be
whispered
the
dutchess
de
n
coming
up
to
the
sopha
on
which
we
sat
you
chevalier
are
so
faithless
added
she
said
i
fixing
my
eyes
on
janetta
grace
misplaces
that
accusation
i
am
constancy
itself
you
ladies
indeed
who
know
the
power
of
your
charms
are
not
to
be
satisfied
with
the
homage
of
a
single
lover
insinuation
sir
replied
janetta
easily
understood
and
if
i
am
happy
enough
to
escape
interruption
from
the
company
i
shall
take
the
present
opportunity
of
freeing
myself
from
your
charges
the
dutchess
will
condescend
to
aid
me
i
believe
montgomery
will
scarcely
doubt
of
the
testimony
of
the
dutchess
de
n
replied
the
dutchess
me
from
lovers
quarrels
for
heaven
sake
my
dear
do
you
suppose
that
you
engross
all
the
charms
of
and
that
poor
i
have
no
better
employment
than
to
shake
my
head
look
grave
and
bear
a
solemn
burden
to
your
serious
speeches
tell
the
story
yourself
child
and
if
the
chevalier
can
look
on
your
face
and
mistrust
you
make
him
a
gay
curtsy
and
follow
me
my
dear
into
yonder
circle
when
the
dutchess
was
gone
janetta
relapsed
into
her
reserve
and
had
i
not
become
extremely
urgent
would
have
deferred
the
explanation
yes
indeed
arthur
i
have
wronged
her
most
shamefully
in
my
suspicions
but
the
story
is
too
long
for
me
to
relate
in
my
present
record
i
drag
through
one
heavy
sentence
after
another
intending
that
each
shall
be
the
last
now
having
by
this
effort
brought
on
an
increase
of
weariness
i
try
what
repose
a
couch
will
afford
me
and
then
away
to
ashburn
and

dear
sir
walter
to
which
of
the
gods
shall
my
hecatomb
blaze
a
burnt
offering
behold
entering
within
those
gates
i
see
the
valmont
coach
i
fly
to
greet
the
welcome
visitants
more
welcome
to
me
than
gold
to
the
miser
than
conquest
to
the
lie
still
thou
throbbing
mischief
down
down
ye
struggling

and
let
the
for
once
spiritless
countenance
of
filmar
conceal
his
hopes
tis
true
boyer
as
as
as
any
thing
that
most
true
here
in
this
very
monkton
hall
is
valmont
ay
and
valmont
too
and
here
i
mean
to
keep
them
only
walter
hail
the
dawn
of
to
morrow
whips
cracking
horses
flying
and
thy
friend
driving
as
fast
as
four
can
carry
him
into
if
you
want
cash
call
on
me
any
day
next
week
you
being
a
friend
i
oblige
but
to
any
one
else
somerville
now
for
instance
or
nugent
will
be
curst
unfortunate
but
i
shall
have
had
a
hard
run
of
late
or
i
shall
be
building
and
want
to
borrow
myself
or
there
will
be
great
arrears
on
my
estates
not
yet
paid
up
but
see
here
comes
a
bowing
cringing
tradesman
who
in
my
days
of
worse
fortune
has
buffeted
me
with
his
looks
many
a
time
and
often
a
a
the
amount
of
your
bill
seems
a
little
enormous
but
i
ca
fatigue
myself
with
looking
into
these
matters
the
steward
pays
you
ay
ay
be
not
troublesome
and
throwing
myself
along
the
sopha
i
may
probably
still
deal
with
sibella
my
dear
raise
these
cushions
under
my
head
psha
child
you
are
devilishly
awkward
there
pooh
throw
that
gauze
shade
of
your
over
sit
down
and
watch
lest
ponto
or
rosetta
should
leap
upon
or
disturb
me
by
the
bye
walter
as
i
am
determined
to
reform
when
i
married
and
become
an
obedient
hopeful
son
and
nephew
if
uncle
valmont
should
think
and
pray
heaven
he
may
my
wife
oh
lord
what
a
shudder
there
is
a
radical
cure
i
assure
i
seized
a
square
piece
of
paper
and
writing
thereon
in
large
characters
placed
it
exactly
opposite
me
and
the
qualm
walter
you
shall
see
wife
written
on
my
page
wife
oh
i
declare
this
scrap
of
paper
is
a
charm
of
infinite
value
if
uncle
valmont
i
say
should
deem
my
wife
education
incomplete
and
desires
to
have
her
longer
under
his
tuition
i
will
yield
her
up
for
one
year
or
two
or
twenty
if
he
there
forbearance
there
magnanimity
dub
me
a
hero
sir
knight
and
place
me
among
the
foremost
talk
of
conquering
a
world
indeed
why
philosophers
of
all
ages
have
agreed
that
the
truest
heroism
is
to
conquer
dub
me
a
hero
i
say
i
grant
you
this
is
all
rattle
that
is
the
manner
not
the
matter
upon
my
honor
and
poor
forced
rattle
too
but
i
must
be
mad
for
i
can
not
be
merry
nor
yet
serious
my
gadding
spirits
are
whirling
this
enterprise
round
and
round
without
ceasing
sometimes
tossing
the
dark
side
toward
me
and
then
ere
i
can
make
one
retracting
reflection
smilingly
presenting
to
me
its
at
that
still
time
of
night
if
my
plan
fail
not
when
graves
yield
up
the
semblance
of
their
dead
my
courtship
is
to
once
begun
it
must
go
on
and
the
second
setting
sun
beholds
me
a
close
your
door
boyer
stir
up
your
fire
and
i
tell
not
now
though
for
enter
griffiths
gentlemen
have
walked
out
to
the
grounds
my
lord
valmont
and
lady
monkton
are
alone
griffiths
i
understand
your
hint
lord
it
will
certainly
take
returning
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
laughing
butler
hates
squire
valmont
and
enjoys
the
thought
of
playing
him
such
a
trick
the
lads
will
have
to
strip
and
turn
out
i
doubt
not
for
this
day
frolic
i
must
provide
for
them
is
our
frolic
and
not
theirs
griffiths
our
plain
fail
can
not
fail
my
lord
well
go
mind
you
give
me
more
water
than
wine
at
dinner
and
now
i
steal
from
a
back
door
make
a
circuit
round
the
house
and
crossing
the
lawn
join
the
dear
good
kind
souls
in
the
drawing
you
shall
hear
from
me
again
presently
walter
i
am
gone
in
reputation
i
mean
to
seek
the
earl
the
baronet
and
the
simple
squire
but
in
propria
persona
returned
to
my
chamber
to
tell
you
a
story
a
story
of
stories
the
ladies
were
in
the
very
heart
of
it
when
i
entered
luckily
i
had
waited
a
sentence
or
two
outside
the
door
or
i
should
have
had
no
clue
to
bespeak
a
continuance
of
the
subject
valmont
was
suspicious
of
me
but
having
persuaded
her
than
i
am
a
sober
sort
of
youth
not
at
all
given
to
and
infidelity
she
proceeded
and
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
listen
with
wondering
eyes
and
gaping
mouth
to
the
particular
account
of
how
where
and
when
miss
valmont
my
wife
that
is
to
be
saw
a
stay
let
me
recollect
a
ghost
is
i
believe
a
terrific
animal
dressed
in
chains
howling
shrieking
and
always
withdrawing
in
a
flash
of
fire
yes
that
a
ghost
this
was
something
more
gentle
and
complacent
valmont
makes
nice
distinctions
i
remember
she
called
it
an
apparition
of
a
spirit
first
appearing
in
the
shape
of
an
old
hermit
then
in
that
of
a
young
handsome
beau
first
walking
manlike
into
a
wood
next
bouncing
up
on
a
sudden
in
an
ay
it
was
a
spirit
sibella
she
poor
little
barbarian
is
no
better
acquainted
with
the
qualities
of
an
apparition
than
of
a
man
for
simply
enough
she
complained
to
valmont
of
the
disturbance
given
by
this
said
shifting
phantom
to
her
meditations
be
sure
lady
monkton
said
valmont
must
laugh
at
most
of
these
stories
but
we
all
know
from
good
authority
such
things
have
been
seen
indeed
i
did
not
altogether
credit
the
very
extraordinary
accounts
i
had
heard
of
the
disturbance
the
valmont
family
had
many
years
ago
received
from
some
thing
that
they
say
inhabits
the
ruin
on
the
rock
and
even
when
my
niece
who
in
such
affairs
is
ignorance
itself
told
me
her
story
i
would
not
be
convinced
till
i
had
sent
three
men
servants
to
search
the
wood
and
the
ruin
if
any
thing
human
had
been
there
it
must
have
been
discovered
the
affair
of
the
armoury
i
only
mentioned
to
my
own
woman
for
i
well
knew
it
was
impossible
that
any
substance
of
flesh
and
blood
out
of
our
own
household
could
get
into
the
armoury
what
can
be
said
lady
monkton
but
that
it
is
to
answer
some
wise
purpose
or
other
valmont
know
said
i
lord
filmar
you
must
judge
poorly
of
my
discretion
to
suppose
that
i
would
tell
valmont
such
an
affair
for
besides
that
there
is
a
shocking
degree
of
impiety
in
people
disbelief
when
the
thing
is
indisputably
true
he
would
torment
the
servants
incessantly
by
sending
them
at
night
into
those
places
and
perhaps
he
might
abridge
the
poor
child
of
her
rambles
around
the
park
miss
valmont
afraid
of
being
alone
asked
lady
monkton
ha
ha
ha
why
she
has
not
one
idea
lady
monkton
belonging
to
a
rational
being
i
assure
you
she
is
not
afraid
of
any
thing
well
really
her
want
of
understanding
is
not
at
all
marvellous
shut
up
in
that
horrid
i
preserve
a
part
of
mine
only
by
reflecting
on
former
days
young
lady
conversation
then
is
not
much
relief
to
you
madam
said
i
indeed
is
her
absence
is
the
relief
my
lord
valmont
was
much
more
kind
than
he
intended
when
he
ordered
his
niece
not
to
frequent
my
it
is
a
thousand
pities
for
the
child
has
a
fine
person
and
is
that
is
had
she
any
thing
like
manners
and
were
not
such
an
absolute
idiot
i
do
think
she
would
be
very
handsome
some
frolic
of
master
clement
montgomery
i
presume
this
apparition
to
be
walter
yet
surely
she
is
not
idiot
enough
to
tell
of
herself
in
such
a
case
ha
woman
woman
still
whether
in
solitude
or
society
i
well
remember
the
fellow
i
saw
tripping
near
yes
yes
he
montgomery
contrives
to
find
secret
admittance
into
that
well
defended
place
and
she
contrives
a
rare
finely
imagined
tale
to
turn
the
people
wits
the
without
and
throw
a
veil
impervious
as
darkness
around
themselves
and
their
yet
hang
it
no
montgomery
said
valmont
was
abroad
on
his
travels
when
this
affair
happened
beside
there
is
a
degree
of
invention
in
the
story
which
must
have
been
beyond
the
capacity
of
so
ignorant
a
heyday
why
i
am
anticipating
eight
and
forty
hours
and
already
beginning
to
feel
myself
accountable
for
my
wife
adventures
peace
be
then
to
the
apparition
ashes
after
the
knot
is
tied
and
i
and
my
bride
are
travelling
homewards
to
receive
forgiveness
and
blessings
i
shall
probably
want
something
to
keep
me
awake
and
the
child
must
tell
me
the
story
in
her
own
way
hark
the
dinner
my
part
in
the
plot
will
soon
be
content
walter
to
trace
it
in
its
several
progressive
steps
toward
the
catastrophe
i
have
not
patience
to
detail
what
is
to
be
and
then
sit
down
to
relate
what
adieu
for
a
few
hours
so
far
so
nay
better
than
good
the
very
elements
have
conspired
to
my
such
a
storm
of
hail
rain
and
thunder
i
never
beheld
at
this
season
of
the
year
the
darkness
was
tremendous
and
shattered
nerves
felt
its
effects
most
powerfully
notwithstanding
the
pompous
harangue
delivered
by
her
caro
sposo
against
such
in
the
midst
of
this
scene
entered
valmont
gentleman
who
bowing
reverently
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
begged
to
know
if
his
lordly
master
would
vouchsafe
to
be
drawn
home
by
one
pair
of
horses
he
came
walter
with
six
for
that
unfortunately
the
postilion
was
very
drunk
exclaimed
valmont
you
say
drunk
the
man
bowed
and
looked
sorry
then
ventured
slowly
to
insinuate
that
he
did
not
deem
the
coachman
perfectly
sober
though
not
absolutely
drunk
he
might
be
able
to
drive
a
pair
of
horses
perhaps
shall
have
my
neck
broken
cried
valmont
all
my
sorrows
will
be
at
an
end
together
and
you
sir
may
be
for
once
satisfied
what
mean
you
said
the
frowning
the
remedy
was
obvious
to
remain
at
monkton
hall
for
the
night
was
proposed
to
valmont
with
great
earnestness
by
sir
gilbert
and
my
lady
and
at
length
acceded
to
by
him
with
due
reluctant
mrs
valmont
smiled
through
her
terrors
to
you
walter
i
give
a
sober
straight
forward
history
but
in
the
opinions
of
my
friends
below
stairs
i
am
fast
approaching
towards
the
honours
which
the
squire
postilion
and
coachman
have
already
purchased
i
affected
to
grow
very
frolicksome
early
after
dinner
and
am
at
length
become
with
the
help
of
claret
and
burgundy
as
properly
intoxicated
to
all
appearance
as
i
find
necessary
to
the
carrying
on
of
my
plan
however
i
am
not
yet
retired
for
the
night
presently
i
mean
to
descend
and
give
them
such
another
specimen
of
my
ability
as
shall
make
my
departure
so
essential
to
their
repose
that
they
will
not
attempt
to
recal
or
disturb
me
a
messenger
boyer
is
gone
to
the
castle
to
give
notice
of
its
master
absence
for
the
night
he
carries
other
tidings
there
also
tidings
to
me
of
great
joy
the
servants
of
valmont
castle
are
held
in
such
constraint
by
their
proud
master
that
to
enjoy
the
pleasures
which
are
permitted
in
other
households
they
are
ever
scheming
the
squire
absence
is
a
festive
holiday
and
griffiths
was
invited
by
the
butler
with
whom
he
has
purposely
scraped
an
intimacy
to
partake
of
the
joy
of
to
day
why
the
invitation
was
neglected
you
may
divine
by
the
messenger
now
sent
to
the
castle
griffiths
informs
the
butler
that
as
valmont
is
safe
at
the
hall
and
lord
filmar
is
safe
in
bed
the
night
is
their
own
he
begs
they
will
prepare
for
mirth
and
gaiety
bids
the
housekeeper
and
her
damsels
put
on
their
dancing
shoes
and
promises
to
join
them
early
accompanied
by
his
brother
who
plays
an
excellent
fiddle
and
is
the
merriest
fellow
alive
such
is
the
substance
of
griffiths
message
to
the
domestics
doubt
them
not
walter
they
will
jump
at
the
opportunity
and
swallow
my
bait
with
all
the
greediness
i
can
desire
it
is
now
past
nine
my
pulse
begins
to
beat
riotously
as
if
i
were
drunk
in
poor
undiscerning
souls
i
have
looked
in
the
glass
all
the
uncertainty
of
my
success
trembles
in
my
eye
all
the
tumult
of
hopes
and
fears
sits
on
my
countenance
yet
these
animals
can
not
perceive
would
it
were
over
the
scene
is
almost
prepared
to
shift
i
am
dismissed
from
the
parlour
and
as
griffiths
tells
them
am
at
rest
now
i
wait
but
his
summons
he
is
gone
to
hint
among
the
servants
here
the
advantage
he
is
about
to
take
of
his
master
infirmity
and
hypocritically
to
request
some
one
will
make
an
excuse
for
him
should
by
chance
awake
and
ring
my
bell
before
he
the
coast
securely
clear
i
quit
the
house
join
griffiths
at
the
lodge
and
at
the
corner
of
a
little
town
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
sir
gilbert
we
are
to
find
griffiths
brother
waiting
in
a
chaise
this
brother
who
would
not
have
been
here
if
we
had
sent
for
him
was
only
a
common
footman
a
week
ago
but
the
two
days
he
has
passed
at
the
inn
in
our
neighbourhood
has
transformed
him
into
a
man
of
property
and
he
does
not
choose
to
go
four
miles
in
the
rain
without
a
covered
carriage
had
it
not
rained
he
would
probably
have
received
a
sprain
in
his
ancle
or
his
knee
the
grand
business
over
for
which
his
assistance
is
required
he
puts
on
the
filmar
livery
and
becomes
my
footman
i
was
going
to
say
my
wife
but
there
hazard
in
that
gratitude
may
beget
love
and
violently
grateful
will
she
be
no
doubt
to
the
man
that
has
helped
to
make
her
walter
i
am
no
coward
yet
i
say
again
would
it
were
over
i
will
put
this
paper
in
my
should
i
get
undetected
into
the
castle
i
shall
have
many
hours
of
waiting
and
to
write
my
thoughts
will
certainly
relieve
me
during
the
tedious
interval
i
hear
griffiths
i
safe
in
the
castle
is
just
eleven
two
will
be
the
earliest
i
dare
attempt
to
seize
my
three
hours
three
ages
i
may
say
to
undergo
all
the
misery
of
expecting
in
every
blast
of
wind
the
destruction
of
my
project
wind
enough
how
it
rolls
floods
of
rain
too
a
horrid
and
tempestuous
night
this
we
must
procure
some
covering
to
shield
her
from
the
storm
till
we
reach
the
chaise
i
will
mention
it
to
griffiths
that
he
may
be
quite
in
readiness
i
should
be
sorry
were
she
to
suffer
by
the
storm
inclemency
does
she
go
unwillingly
she
suffers
enough
in
going
goes
she
willingly
still
she
deserves
not
to
why
thou
cold
whining
filmar
where
is
thy
manhood
only
the
last
stroke
wanting
and
that
the
easiest
to
accomplish
and
thy
scheme
thy
darling
scheme
is
thy
very
valet
claps
the
wings
of
exultation
and
sings
the
song
of
triumph
shame
shame
rouse
thyself
cast
a
look
forward
filmar
yes
walter
i
am
here
happily
supplied
with
a
lighted
taper
by
the
dexterity
and
contrivance
of
securely
stationed
in
one
of
the
best
apartments
where
even
the
mirth
of
the
servants
can
not
reach
me
in
a
buzzing
murmur
there
is
no
hazard
that
any
one
of
them
should
quit
his
diversions
to
wander
among
the
mazy
recesses
of
this
mansion
and
i
do
rejoice
abundantly
in
my
yet
walter
i
may
rejoice
and
feel
the
benumbing
effects
of
this
cold
gloomy
dwellings
these
old
buildings
are
admirably
contrived
to
fix
odd
impressions
on
the
i
do
not
at
all
wonder
that
every
ancient
castle
is
haunted
in
another
such
night
in
another
such
place
and
i
could
swear
i
perceived
shapeless
forms
gliding
around
i
listen
one
minute
to
the
variety
of
sound
produced
by
the
gathering
winds
and
the
next
find
it
hushed
to
so
dead
a
calm
that
the
sound
of
my
breathings
alone
interrupts
the
silence
such
think
of
it
think
of
it
walter
such
are
my
employments
i
wonder
whereabouts
this
armoury
lays
griffiths
could
the
castle
is
amazing
large
yet
griffiths
is
perfectly
skilled
in
its
he
described
to
me
as
we
came
hither
the
situation
of
miss
valmont
they
are
nearer
to
where
i
am
now
stationed
than
to
any
other
habitable
part
of
the
building
the
spacious
gallery
into
which
this
room
opens
runs
the
length
of
the
whole
front
excepting
the
wings
and
the
towers
narrow
long
passages
connect
the
wings
with
the
main
building
and
the
passage
nearest
my
side
of
the
gallery
conducts
you
by
a
short
flight
of
steps
immediately
up
to
miss
valmont
abode
but
this
is
not
the
road
we
are
to
take
because
in
a
little
room
within
that
passage
sleeps
her
attendant
silent
andrew
and
we
choose
not
to
pass
so
near
him
lest
perhaps
these
resounding
walls
tell
him
of
our
our
is
a
more
intricate
path
the
adjoining
antichamber
will
lead
us
to
a
narrower
descending
this
we
shall
cross
some
of
the
lower
apartments
and
making
a
circuit
gain
the
bottom
of
the
west
tower
from
whence
alleys
and
winding
stone
stairs
will
introduce
us
to
the
end
of
miss
gallery
opposite
to
that
we
must
have
entered
had
we
gone
in
the
straight
forward
direction
we
deem
it
advisable
to
descend
with
our
charge
the
same
way
and
to
leave
the
castle
by
a
little
door
in
the
west
tower
it
is
to
be
sure
on
the
wrong
side
and
will
oblige
us
to
carry
our
burthen
if
the
young
lady
should
not
be
disposed
just
then
to
make
use
of
her
limbs
so
much
the
further
griffiths
brother
is
a
strong
bony
fellow
strength
will
be
necessary
if
persuasion
should
fail
and
i
can
not
spare
more
than
ten
minutes
to
try
the
effects
of
my
rhetoric
i
will
enter
first
and
should
a
shriek
of
surprise
or
shriek
of
rapture
remember
my
person
walter
escape
her
the
closed
doors
distance
of
situation
and
sleep
of
security
will
prevent
andrew
from
hearing
indeed
should
he
interfere
it
is
only
the
extra
trouble
of
him
to
good
behaviour
it
did
once
enter
my
thoughts
to
bribe
this
old
fellow
to
our
purposes
but
the
attempt
might
have
wrought
a
discovery
fearing
nothing
he
suspects
nothing
absence
of
all
care
and
a
warm
lull
him
to
repose
and
pleasant
be
his
ours
all
the
hazard
ours
the
reward
i
have
promised
to
griffiths
and
to
his
brother
my
share
of
the
plunder
is
to
them
a
secret
now
though
i
allow
the
damsel
one
squall
yet
i
positively
interdict
any
repetitions
of
the
sort
and
as
you
know
i
immediately
became
the
arbiter
of
her
fate
the
sooner
i
accustom
her
to
implicit
obedience
the
easier
it
will
be
to
both
in
future
walter
i
mend
my
flagging
spirits
begin
to
bound
and
curvet
oh
when
we
are
once
seated
in
that
chaise
and
four
which
now
waits
our
coming
in
a
retired
corner
not
above
a
hundred
yards
from
the
other
side
of
the
moat
how
will
my
imagination
outstrip
the
speed
of
the
horses
dost
thou
talk
of
pursuit
no
no
i
mock
pursuit
supposing
we
get
not
away
till
three
or
four
we
still
shall
have
six
or
seven
hours
advantage
in
point
of
time
then
the
old
dons
wo
dream
which
way
we
are
they
do
not
know
what
you
and
i
do
know
the
great
reward
attendant
on
my
deed
and
sorrowfully
remembering
the
wickedness
and
sinfulness
of
their
own
youthful
hearts
they
will
unrighteously
judge
of
me
and
sit
down
piteously
to
lament
the
loss
of
the
lady
honour
whilst
i
like
a
good
christian
and
worthy
member
of
society
so
far
from
diminishing
am
increasing
her
stock
of
honour
for
the
honour
of
a
virgin
is
but
a
single
portion
whereas
according
to
wise
institutions
the
honour
of
a
wife
is
twofold
she
bearing
her
husband
honour
and
her
own
pray
heaven
the
cargo
be
not
too
mighty
is
lord
filmar
says
one
of
the
party
assembled
at
ten
morning
to
breakfast
in
monkton
hall
parlour
griffiths
to
let
his
lordship
know
we
expect
him
at
breakfast
says
the
earl
told
griffiths
my
lord
replies
the
footman
one
servant
will
always
lie
for
another
he
says
his
lordship
is
asleep
this
produces
many
pleasant
allusions
to
last
night
intemperance
among
the
good
souls
and
they
go
to
breakfast
without
me
now
in
the
steward
room
one
wonders
griffiths
is
not
come
home
a
second
wonders
at
my
good
nature
and
his
faults
and
a
fourth
wonders
i
do
not
awake
amidst
all
this
wit
and
wonder
another
hour
or
two
passes
and
then
two
or
three
more
probably
in
the
surmises
occasioned
by
the
discovery
of
my
absence
the
servants
of
the
castle
in
the
mean
time
are
employed
in
their
usual
occupations
not
at
all
surprised
that
their
visitors
had
quitted
them
early
unseen
because
it
had
been
so
intended
by
them
andrew
indeed
waits
miss
valmont
summons
for
breakfast
and
deems
it
somewhat
tardy
he
concludes
her
walk
to
be
unusually
pleasing
and
eats
his
own
repast
in
peace
and
quietness
at
length
his
thoughts
verge
towards
the
extraordinary
and
he
inclines
to
seek
further
no
andrew
is
in
vain
you
search
no
fair
greets
your
eye
no
voice
answers
to
your
ay
ay
assemble
them
hold
your
convocations
in
the
great
hall
crowd
closer
and
closer
whisper
your
suspicions
lest
the
dread
ear
of
valmont
catch
the
tidings
that
is
gone
who
shall
carry
these
tidings
to
mr
valmont
not
i
not
i
not
i
answers
every
voice
at
once
and
up
to
the
hall
door
drives
his
coach
and
six
away
fly
the
pale
culprits
jostling
against
each
other
confusion
retards
their
speed
and
the
dreadful
secret
is
in
part
betrayed
fye
valmont
fye
do
swear
do
call
hard
names
ca
you
hear
him
walter
declaring
his
rage
and
threatening
his
vengeance
i
can
ill
news
fly
fast
valmont
horses
are
not
turn
your
eyes
to
monkton
hall
see
the
squire
enter
see
the
earl
turn
pale
the
baronet
attempt
to
look
sorry
and
see
them
as
i
before
observed
sitting
in
judgment
on
me
and
putting
their
own
black
constructions
on
my
innocent
intentions
assuredly
walter
could
i
have
commanded
every
circumstance
in
my
own
way
it
could
not
have
happened
more
favourably
valmont
porter
is
ill
and
has
been
removed
from
the
lodge
into
the
house
to
be
better
nursed
two
grooms
were
deputed
to
take
care
of
the
valmont
absent
we
found
it
down
and
down
it
remains
with
what
art
griffiths
drew
off
the
postilion
while
i
got
into
the
chaise
the
lad
had
not
a
suspicion
he
carried
more
than
two
i
crouched
to
the
bottom
as
they
got
out
and
griffiths
whip
up
the
blinds
in
an
instant
he
gave
me
one
complete
fright
for
we
had
agreed
the
postilion
should
follow
them
into
the
house
to
be
paid
while
i
freed
myself
imagine
how
i
trembled
to
hear
them
discharging
him
on
the
spot
and
he
thanking
and
wishing
their
honours
good
night
my
boy
at
length
cried
griffiths
thou
got
a
wet
jacket
indeed
master
replied
the
postilion
well
soaked
you
griping
old
fellow
this
was
addressed
to
the
butler
who
had
come
out
to
meet
them
grow
as
stingy
as
your
master
why
you
offer
the
lad
a
little
inside
clothing
come
postilion
come
you
shall
go
in
and
drink
my
health
in
a
bumper
but
first
my
boy
lead
your
horses
under
that
arch
and
they
escape
being
wetter
then
singing
he
led
the
whole
train
into
the
back
part
of
the
castle
now
this
thought
of
the
arch
was
the
luckiest
imaginable
for
had
any
of
the
grooms
by
chance
staid
loitering
about
the
yard
the
chaise
was
then
so
effectually
screened
they
could
not
have
seen
me
descend
from
it
turning
on
the
right
side
of
the
arch
i
crept
along
the
front
of
the
castle
crossed
the
inner
court
and
the
hall
door
with
one
gentle
push
gave
me
admittance
had
the
door
been
fastened
i
must
have
waited
there
till
griffiths
could
steal
an
opportunity
to
let
me
in
in
this
part
of
the
castle
was
dark
as
darkness
itself
but
as
i
had
been
in
this
apartment
before
and
came
by
the
great
i
found
my
way
hither
without
trip
or
stumble
griff
i
fancied
nay
i
sure
i
heard
a
noise
yet
all
is
silent
it
was
like
the
creaking
of
a
door
and
like
something
rat
probably
the
midnight
tenants
of
the
mansion
good
god
how
slowly
the
minutes
move
only
seventeen
minutes
and
a
half
after
twelve
astonishing
that
must
be
hail
surely
i
never
heard
rain
drive
with
such
the
casements
tremble
i
could
almost
fancy
the
building
rocks
with
the
tempest
violence
what
wonders
will
not
education
custom
and
habit
accomplish
miss
valmont
i
dare
say
feels
no
horror
in
listening
to
such
sounds
nor
tracing
these
murmuring
galleries
lonely
staircases
i
should
not
exist
six
months
in
this
she
must
indeed
be
a
strange
unformed
being
her
portrait
that
i
told
you
of
hangs
in
this
very
room
and
on
my
conscience
it
would
persuade
me
she
is
an
animated
intelligent
creature
but
i
know
is
impossible
and
now
and
then
when
the
per
annum
gets
a
little
into
the
shade
i
anticipate
fearful
things
it
is
fortunate
walter
that
she
has
the
advantages
of
person
for
on
that
account
i
shall
have
a
little
the
less
reluctance
in
showing
her
to
the
world
and
a
little
more
pleasure
in
attempting
to
humanize
yet
i
fear
it
will
be
but
gawky
beauty
neither
and
that
i
robust
health
no
doubt
strong
limbs
hanging
arms
a
gigantic
stride
and
the
stare
of
a
savage
oh
dear
i
must
be
fond
too
i
suppose
as
we
travel
towards
matrimony
but
i
do
feel
the
least
inclined
to
fondness
no
although
i
shall
seize
her
unattired
in
bed
no
not
one
wild
wish
or
mischievous
thought
will
enter
my
my
pulse
will
continue
to
beat
my
blood
keep
in
its
temperate
course
i
shall
be
a
perfect
anchorite
for
me
she
can
have
no
my
merciful
do
i
dream
or
boyer
am
i
not
in
valmont
castle
did
i
not
come
hither
to
carry
off
the
niece
of
valmont
and
was
that
bright
vision
the
sibella
valmont
whom
i
have
so
traduced
hush
walter
repeat
not
my
crime
if
thou
hopest
for
peace
in
this
world
or
happiness
in
the
next
it
could
not
be
her
her
that
i
came
in
search
of
yes
but
it
was
her
angel
as
she
is
in
form
her
heart
is
the
heart
of
a
mortal
still
clement
said
she
and
spreading
one
hand
upon
her
heaving
bosom
sighed
she
addressed
herself
to
that
picture
thou
safe
my
love
terrifying
dreams
disturb
my
rest
she
saw
me
not
for
her
back
was
toward
me
as
she
entered
preserve
my
clement
said
she
again
after
a
pause
she
would
have
continued
thus
soliloquizing
but
i
to
gain
a
view
of
her
face
attempted
to
change
my
attitude
my
cursed
coat
had
somehow
got
entangled
in
the
chair
and
threw
it
against
the
table
as
i
moved
she
turned
around
and
i
as
in
the
presence
of
a
goddess
bowed
lowly
to
the
very
ground
she
then
approached
nearer
and
my
eyes
retreated
from
the
scrutiny
with
which
she
viewed
me
the
examination
lasted
more
than
a
minute
and
all
that
time
i
was
racking
my
invention
to
find
words
to
address
her
but
i
might
as
well
have
been
born
dumb
i
had
neither
articulation
nor
sounds
to
articulate
me
sir
said
she
and
i
like
the
idiot
i
had
been
describing
her
bowed
again
valmont
may
bring
you
here
may
make
this
castle
my
prison
but
my
will
is
free
i
tell
you
sir
i
am
beyond
your
reach
remember
it
i
am
beyond
your
reach
and
away
she
glided
valmont
may
bring
you
why
who
the
devil
could
she
take
me
for
i
thought
valmont
brought
nobody
here
am
beyond
your
say
not
so
sweet
saint
i
would
not
have
you
now
beyond
my
reach
for
a
king
ransom
if
she
should
alarm
the
house
hark
is
she
knew
me
yet
knew
me
defied
me
yet
is
a
stranger
to
my
what
can
all
this
mean
ha
then
it
may
be
true
that
this
frightful
place
has
deranged
her
intellects
certainly
that
is
the
case
she
looked
a
lovely
lunatic
wrapped
up
in
a
loose
gown
her
hair
streaming
at
its
length
and
arisen
in
the
dead
of
night
to
apostrophize
to
her
own
picture
yet
i
am
not
deterred
walter
i
undertake
her
restoration
expect
me
in
london
immediately
i
unsay
all
i
would
not
yield
her
up
to
her
uncle
no
not
for
an
hour
is
she
returned
to
her
bed
i
wonder
oh
my
moderation
is
given
to
the
wind
the
time
draws
near
i
heard
the
clapping
of
distant
i
can
not
i
can
hardly
breathe
boyer
they
shall
neither
of
them
touch
i
will
carry
her
i
could
not
bear
to
see
their
arms
encircle
the
sweet
i
enter
her
chamber
her
face
they
must
behold
but
with
the
same
zeal
that
i
would
feast
mine
own
senses
upon
her
other
charms
will
i
hide
them
from
the
profanation
of
vulgar
eyes
the
great
clock
striking
two
has
just
filled
the
turrets
with
its
griffiths
has
been
with
me
their
gayer
sports
have
ceased
punch
bowls
and
story
telling
succeed
the
dance
and
song
their
animal
spirits
drooping
with
excess
and
fatigue
their
old
midnight
habits
mysterious
tales
of
ghosts
go
round
the
circle
and
each
becomes
desirous
of
seeking
rest
though
fearful
to
separate
a
few
more
bumpers
griffiths
says
will
at
once
bring
them
courage
and
sleep
he
bids
me
assure
myself
of
success
griffiths
and
his
brother
are
to
have
a
chamber
in
the
front
of
the
north
wing
all
the
domestics
he
says
except
andrew
and
his
daughter
lie
in

two
hours
of
this

how
should
you
when
you
come
to
this

my

to
your
my
two
agents
are
here
the
light
is
already
placed
in
the
dark
not
a
sleepless
eye
in
the
castle
but
our
own
all
even
old
andrew
partook
of
the
libations
and
resigned
their
senses
to
seal
my
triumph
griffiths
has
shown
me
a
gagg
it
will
not
sure
be
necessary
should
it
i
will
heal
those
lips
with
kisses
my
lines
no
wonder
on
the
summit
now
i
only
stay
to
seal
this
letter
in
the

arrive

after
it
shall
be

letter
i
from
lord
filmar
to
sir
walter
boyer
dear
walter
two
days
have
i
allowed
you
to
wear
out
your
astonishment
at
my
ingenuity
address
and
perseverance
and
to
exercise
your
imagination
in
following
me
and
my
bride
from
stage
to
stage
of
this
admirably
contrived
does
the
novelty
of
the
adventure
wear
off
happy
knight
to
have
for
thy
chosen
friend
and
bosom
confidant
one
who
can
ever
open
the
field
of
variety
before
thee
and
who
to
cheer
thy
languid
fancy
removes
the
pleasure
on
which
thou
hadst
feasted
to
satiety
and
places
the
view
of
disappointment
in
its
stead
yes
indeed
old
andrew
will
find
miss
valmont
where
he
left
her
and
i
shall
not
be
hanged
for
don
valmont
need
not
swear
and
the
trio
will
not
sit
in
judgment
on
my
i
have
had
my
day
of
rage
and
my
day
of
sullens
and
now
in
the
calmness
of
grief
i
sit
down
to
tell
thee
that
instead
of
being
circled
in
my
fair
one
arms
lord
of
her
wealth
i
am
yet
a
poor
gamester
and
the
guest
of
sir
gilbert
monckton
heigh
ho
had
my
plan
been
over
turned
when
but
half
advanced
or
had
this
family
or
that
even
my
father
or
her
uncle
detected
me
and
torn
her
from
my
gripe
i
had
forgiven
it
but
to
be
defeated
in
the
moment
of
success
by
my
own
agents
my
tools
tools
for
whose
conscience
and
courage
i
had
bargained
such
tools
i
say
to
be
frightened
by
a
bearded
nobody
knows
what
oh
is
too
much
i
swear
when
i
wrote
you
that
letter
i
would
not
have
abated
of
my
utmost
expectations
for
the
chances
against
me
how
could
i
foresee
i
should
have
to
deal
with
a
knavish
sort
of
a
nameless
something
who
upon
earth
would
imagine
in
a
seclusion
so
perfect
this
girl
could
baffle
a
vigilant
guardian
dupe
a
whole
family
and
with
an
art
the
most
refined
intrigue
under
circumstances
and
forms
which
sets
discovery
at
defiance
too
but
my
well
i
described
our
intended
route
and
in
due
process
we
had
crossed
the
antichamber
gone
down
the
winding
stairs
traversed
the
range
of
apartments
below
and
arrived
at
the
west
tower
without
the
single
creaking
of
a
shoe
to
tell
our
progress
but
mind
me
these
brave
fellows
who
had
so
amply
ridiculed
the
believing
souls
of
the
castle
for
their
stories
and
their
ghosts
now
began
to
creep
closer
to
each
and
at
every
puff
of
wind
that
whizzed
past
us
they
shrunk
in
circumference
thus
i
tell
you
we
reached
the
west
tower
a
tower
long
haunted
in
renown
and
of
which
no
apartment
is
either
in
use
or
preservation
we
entered
a
rude
kind
of
saloon
where
we
dimly
saw
mouldering
walls
and
unoccupied
pedestals
scraps
of
its
former
carved
ornaments
were
strewed
upon
the
pavements
and
here
and
there
the
faint
rays
of
our
lanthern
glanced
upon
an
headless
hero
the
saloon
was
cold
and
dreary
a
wintry
blast
crept
round
us
with
the
hollow
murmur
of
emptiness
we
were
treading
ground
of
which
the
apparitions
of
the
castle
had
for
time
immemorial
claimed
the
undisturbed
possession
and
the
panic
struck
hearts
of
my
companions
were
doubtless
anticipating
supernatural
disasters
when
slam
went
some
door
at
no
great
distance
lord
have
mercy
on
us
cried
griffiths
seizing
on
my
arm
while
his
yet
paler
brother
envying
him
the
supposed
protection
forced
himself
between
us
and
i
have
still
the
misfortune
to
bear
tokens
of
his
cowardly
gripe
enraged
with
the
pain
of
this
fellow
pinch
and
the
terror
of
being
surprised
i
shook
him
off
like
a
fly
and
closing
up
the
lanthern
i
listened
attentively
at
each
door
of
the
saloon
and
became
convinced
we
had
heard
only
one
of
the
accidental
noises
of
an
old
and
shattered
building
me
ye
frightened
fools
said
i
at
your
peril
my
lord
whispered
both
cowards
together
were
not
at
all
frightened
and
with
a
look
expressive
enough
i
believe
for
i
was
then
mad
with
apprehension
least
their
ignorance
and
credulity
should
ruin
my
project
i
awed
them
into
silence
i
again
bade
them
follow
with
the
tone
of
authoritative
command
and
cowards
are
at
all
times
most
ready
to
obey
our
next
stage
and
last
except
the
stairs
was
a
winding
narrow
damp
stone
the
devil
certainly
owed
me
a
grudge
since
he
incited
me
to
enter
it
at
that
ten
minutes
sooner
and
i
had
probably
secured
the
damsel
and
had
left
the
invisible
inamorato
to
sigh
as
it
is
now
alass
walter
my
fate
and
fortune
this
passage
was
barely
wide
enough
for
three
to
walk
abreast
i
placed
myself
in
the
middle
and
they
clung
to
me
with
infinite
zeal
i
carried
the
lanthern
and
our
step
was
soft
as
secresy
on
my
part
and
terror
on
their
could
make
turning
an
angle
of
this
infernal
passage
behold
there
came
sweeping
towards
us
a
tall
long
bearded
figure
in
a
black
cloak
and
carrying
a
dark
lanthern
likewise
zounds
what
a
howl
from
griffiths
and
his
brother
the
phantom
fled
i
that
beard
never
never
grew
on
his
chin
he
me
and
i
could
only
keep
him
in
sight
till
like
a
flash
of
lightning
he
darted
through
a
pair
of
heavy
folding
i
expected
nothing
so
surely
as
that
he
had
secured
them
on
the
inside
and
now
grown
desperate
i
resolved
on
a
trial
of
strength
but
the
doors
gave
me
admission
as
readily
as
they
had
done
to
him
and
the
long
swords
helmets
truncheons
and
other
rusty
weapons
and
accoutrements
taught
me
i
was
in
the
armoury
now
walter
heaven
and
himself
only
know
to
this
hour
what
became
of
him
these
eyes
saw
him
enter
but
neither
eyes
or
hands
could
find
him
there
four
narrow
casements
gave
light
to
the
armoury
and
these
were
most
amply
defended
by
cross
bars
of
iron
that
way
he
could
not
vanish
you
and
others
may
talk
of
nursery
prejudices
till
ye
are
hoarse
with
discussion
and
i
will
still
maintain
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
man
to
witness
the
unaccountable
escape
of
this
spright
without
feeling
his
blood
change
its
course
i
honestly
confess
drops
of
cold
dew
stood
on
my
forehead
as
i
paced
round
and
round
this
vast
hall
holding
up
my
lanthern
at
every
fifth
step
to
discover
and
endeavouring
from
each
crack
and
crevice
to
force
an
opening
into
some
other
none
could
i
a
fearful
awe
crept
to
my
i
looked
behind
me
and
around
me
even
the
void
seemed
to
threaten
me
with
something
undefined
and
horrible
baffled
in
my
search
i
turned
my
thoughts
from
the
phantom
to
miss
valmont
and
remembered
with
renewed
courage
that
as
the
spright
declined
giving
me
an
interview
there
sprang
no
apparent
hindrance
to
my
heart
filmar
said
i
to
myself
seek
thy
agents
and
complete
thy
bold
undertaking
no
sooner
were
the
hinges
of
the
closing
armoury
door
silenced
than
i
heard
the
passage
resound
with
the
audible
voice
of
griffiths
brother
repeating
as
follows
the
third
and
fourth
generation
i
believe
in
the
holy
ghost
born
of
the
virgin
mary
and
in
pontius
pilate
crucified
dead
and
buried
but
deliver
us
from
all
evil
the
holy
catholic
church
and
communion
of
saints
and
lead
us
not
into
temptation
to
be
a
light
to
lighten
the
gentiles
father
son
and
holy
ghost
as
it
was
in
the
beginning
i
believe
in
charming
thought
i
this
will
do
exactly
these
echoing
vaults
will
bear
the
tidings
to
miss
valmont
chamber
and
presently
we
shall
be
all
at
prayers
together
there
was
he
kneeling
when
i
came
up
his
face
close
to
the
wall
nor
would
he
open
his
eyes
nor
cease
his
unnatural
jargon
till
i
had
shaken
cuffed
him
and
actually
stamped
and
swore
aloud
for
vexation
verily
knight
the
saddest
of
sorrow
sons
must
have
yielded
to
laughter
had
he
viewed
the
ghastly
countenance
this
poor
wretch
exhibited
and
had
likewise
seen
the
half
raised
under
which
he
scowled
a
fearful
examination
of
my
whole
perceiving
i
had
neither
nor
cloven
foot
cautiously
and
tremblingly
he
ventured
to
lay
three
fingers
on
my
arm
i
did
not
vanish
into
air
as
doubtless
he
expected
and
the
fool
overjoyed
to
find
me
a
real
man
of
flesh
and
blood
sprang
up
with
open
arms
to
embrace
me
desirous
to
elude
the
kindness
i
stepped
aside
his
clumsy
elbow
came
in
contact
with
the
lanthern
dashed
it
from
my
hand
and
left
us
in
total
darkness
with
the
extinguished
light
expired
my
last
hope
to
go
on
was
impossible
and
who
would
not
like
me
have
endeavoured
to
wreak
some
little
vengeance
on
the
stupid
destroyers
of
my
scheme
fortunately
for
them
and
perhaps
in
the
end
for
myself
griffiths
brother
fearing
my
escape
had
seized
me
behind
and
gaining
strength
from
his
terror
pinioned
me
in
spite
of
all
my
struggles
and
threats
till
as
the
price
of
my
own
freedom
i
engaged
to
assist
them
in
getting
safe
from
this
asylum
of
accidents
apparitions
and
harms
do
not
suppose
walter
that
here
ended
my
provocations
no
indeed
for
griffiths
who
had
lain
extended
on
the
ground
since
the
apparition
first
appeared
venting
sighs
groans
and
tears
in
abundance
doubled
his
share
of
my
torments
by
refusing
for
a
full
hour
at
least
either
to
be
soothed
or
scolded
into
the
use
of
his
legs
be
assured
i
had
left
him
to
his
repose
but
the
brother
would
not
take
of
his
embargo
till
all
the
conditions
on
my
part
were
fulfilled
the
door
which
led
to
the
terrace
we
had
opened
ready
on
leaving
the
saloon
and
thither
i
rather
dragged
than
conducted
we
closed
it
after
us
and
then
with
a
bitter
curse
i
bade
them
aid
themselves
and
walked
on
before
ruminating
on
my
fatal
disappointment
and
its
more
fatal
consequences
imagine
what
i
felt
when
we
came
up
to
the
waiting
chaise
horses
money
expended
which
i
want
demands
increased
which
i
can
not
and
so
near
so
very
near
to
well
i
will
not
think
it
was
past
five
when
we
got
back
to
sir
gilbert
i
threw
myself
on
the
bed
but
slept
not
walter
at
breakfast
they
particularly
valmont
and
my
father
wondered
at
the
alteration
in
my
countenance
i
muttered
curses
at
their
inquisitiveness
they
doubtless
thought
it
was
blessings
for
their
consolations
and
kindly
increased
them
not
one
syllable
has
griffiths
breathed
on
the
adventure
we
dress
and
undress
as
mute
as
mourners
at
a
funeral
the
brother
is
too
much
humbled
by
the
affair
of
the
lanthern
to
appear
before
me
at
present
eat
he
must
be
my
disappointment
what
it
may
do
take
him
into
your
household
walter
then
if
i
catch
a
glimpse
of
future
operations
and
find
his
aid
needful
he
would
doubtless
double
his
diligence
and
call
up
his
valour
to
retrieve
a
lost
reputation
order
steele
to
go
on
again
with
the
writings
i
will
be
in
town
to
sign
by
the
heigh
ho
one
last
sigh
to
the
memory
of
my
departing
i
why
walter
these
fashionable
damsels
beat
us
hollow
in
the
ease
and
gaiety
of
impudence
miss
monckton
who
arrived
here
the
day
following
my
disaster
just
now
entered
the
library
and
coming
up
to
the
writing
table
familiarly
peered
over
my
shoulder
oh
you
wretch
cried
she
snatching
the
paper
from
under
my
hand
is
the
volume
of
your
sins
nay
i
protest
i
read
it
and
she
actually
crammed
it
into
her
pocket
said
i
passionately
insist
on
your
giving
me
the
letter
i
insist
on
keeping
it
is
not
a
lady
equal
to
that
of
a
lord
come
hither
she
pulled
me
toward
the
glass
at
guilty
or
not
guilty
ah
filmar
filmar
from
whom
did
you
take
your
lesson
of
blushing
but
let
me
go
let
me
i
die
to
read
the
story
that
i
may
know
whether
you
have
yet
any
chance
for
heaven
i
do
perceive
walter
why
sex
should
be
a
security
against
such
a
revenge
i
could
have
bestowed
with
a
warm
on
miss
i
took
the
next
best
in
my
power
and
had
just
forced
the
paper
from
her
when
in
walked
my
father
and
the
lady
withdrew
would
you
believe
it
the
earl
solemnly
asked
how
i
dared
treat
with
such
impertinence
a
woman
of
miss
monckton
rank
did
i
think
i
was
romping
with
some
chambermaid
assured
my
lord
answered
i
i
made
a
respectful
distinction
in
this
case
it
is
on
the
side
of
the
chambermaid
my
father
looked
his
reply
as
well
as
he
could
walter
and
walked
away
miss
monckton
is
a
coquette
with
all
the
finish
of
high
breeding
she
is
elegant
though
diminutive
highly
accomplished
in
exterior
the
rest
a
yet
her
ease
grace
and
vivacity
would
have
claimed
more
moments
of
admiration
from
me
were
not
my
thoughts
perpetually
gadding
after
this
sibella
valmont
sometimes
arraigning
sometimes
acquitting
her
but
my
heart
has
no
interest
in
the
motive
no
she
is
quite
an
original
formed
rather
to
constitute
the
business
of
a
life
than
the
casual
pleasure
of
a
moment
i
should
hate
uniformity
even
of
happiness
give
me
the
zest
of
an
occasional
hour
of
rapture
snatched
from
a
vortex
of
novelty
whim
and
folly
a
blessed
portion
has
miss
monckton
of
these
latter
recommendations
but
seven
thousand
pounds
ca
buy
me
six
thousand
pounds
per
annum
there
the
bribe
walter
and
if
i
must
have
a
evil
why
let
it
be
the
vice
of
nature
rather
than
a
vice
of
education
and
ay
but
i
forgot
miss
valmont
has
her
art
too
and
a
devilish
art
it
and
now
dare
i
not
with
all
my
zealous
wishes
perpetually
impelling
me
to
the
discovery
yet
dare
i
not
spoil
their
pleasures
to
blast
montgomery
is
to
betray
myself
by
my
soul
walter
she
is
a
most
lovely
clement
clement
art
thou
safe
my
love
what
the
hour
of
assignation
was
past
no
doubt
happy
fellow
favoured
montgomery
who
nightly
turns
the
dwelling
of
horror
into
mahomet
paradise
with
this
houri
be
in
london
to
meet
me
by
the
filmar
this
instant
has
it
shot
across
my
mind
to
ask
valmont
for
letters
to
his
pupil
the
lad
ca
be
here
and
there
too
it
will
afford
me
a
fine
and
safe
opportunity
of
setting
scrutiny
on
foot
adieu
letter
ii
from
arthur
murden
to
clement
montgomery
wilt
make
her
thy
good
god
what
an
implication
and
is
her
claim
yet
to
be
enforced
will
make
her
my
how
often
since
i
read
thy
letter
have
i
repeated
those
words
those
despicable
words
trust
me
clement
i
have
no
settled
ill
will
towards
thee
no
by
heaven
have
i
not
yet
there
are
moments
when
i
hate
thee
heartily
the
severity
with
which
i
speak
may
dissolve
the
bond
of
our
intimacy
was
it
ever
a
bond
of
friendship
carry
me
back
to
its
murden
said
the
good
natured
du
bois
have
a
young
gentleman
committed
to
my
care
whom
i
wish
to
make
known
to
you
and
then
he
expatiated
on
the
greatness
of
your
expectations
the
astonishing
privacy
of
your
education
and
the
singular
naiveté
of
your
manners
such
as
he
described
you
were
and
i
neglected
all
my
former
acquaintance
to
run
with
you
through
the
round
of
town
amusements
with
what
enthusiasm
did
you
enjoy
with
what
fire
did
you
describe
no
moment
of
disgust
or
lassitude
assailed
you
the
existing
pleasure
was
still
the
best
the
greatest
all
to
you
was
rapture
fascination
enchantment
what
a
novelty
methought
how
enviable
and
extraordinary
for
i
had
partaken
of
these
pleasures
without
a
particle
of
enjoyment
frequenting
the
resorts
of
dissipation
from
custom
labouring
to
compel
my
revolting
senses
to
the
gratifications
of
pleasure
struggling
to
wear
a
character
opposite
to
my
inclination
seeking
in
public
to
seduce
the
attentions
of
women
from
whose
hours
of
private
yielding
i
fled
with
disgust
effectually
removed
from
society
which
would
have
taught
me
the
importance
of
mental
pursuits
and
living
in
the
profusion
of
splendor
i
almost
prayed
for
wants
for
a
something
any
thing
that
could
interrupt
the
routine
of
sameness
that
could
make
me
cease
to
be
as
it
were
the
mere
automaton
of
habit
you
charmed
me
i
longed
to
investigate
the
source
of
your
satisfactions
you
did
not
inform
my
understanding
but
you
greatly
interested
my
curiosity
my
uncle
talked
of
my
making
the
grand
tour
and
that
was
your
destiny
likewise
it
must
be
amusing
thought
i
to
travel
with
one
so
volatile
yet
energetic
and
such
an
arrangement
was
speedily
resolved
on
we
travelled
sometimes
you
complained
of
my
indifference
of
the
cold
reserve
that
hung
upon
my
character
but
the
avidity
with
which
you
perpetually
hunted
after
variety
and
the
readiness
wherewith
i
listened
to
your
descriptions
reconciled
you
to
whatever
discordance
you
chanced
to
perceive
between
my
feelings
and
your
am
i
not
right
clement
was
not
this
rather
intimacy
than
friendship
while
we
viewed
the
alps
and
pyrenees
their
sublimity
poured
into
my
mind
a
flood
of
enthusiasm
the
laughing
as
the
french
emphatically
call
it
country
of
italy
filled
me
with
delight
but
memory
can
often
present
such
scenes
with
the
warmth
and
vigour
they
first
bestow
and
even
her
attempts
were
repressed
by
the
multitudes
of
follies
that
perpetually
assailed
us
i
saw
on
every
hand
oppression
priestcraft
and
blindness
neither
my
tutor
nor
my
companions
were
capable
of
stimulating
me
to
inquire
into
the
moral
and
physical
causes
of
the
evils
i
lamented
and
perceiving
only
the
effect
i
concluded
they
were
without
remedy
and
dismissed
the
subject
to
one
point
then
i
chained
my
expectations
and
that
one
point
was
love
and
here
i
quixoted
my
fancy
into
the
wildest
hopes
i
wanted
beauty
without
vanity
talent
without
ostentation
delicacy
without
timidity
and
courage
without
boast
if
i
saw
the
semblance
of
any
of
these
qualities
i
hastened
to
search
for
the
rest
disappointment
succeeded
disappointment
without
producing
any
other
effect
than
to
bring
the
visions
of
my
brain
before
me
with
fresh
allurements
with
increase
of
attributes
you
montgomery
perhaps
happily
for
yourself
have
been
a
stranger
to
this
species
of
refinement
you
could
have
loved
any
where
and
the
utmost
stretch
of
your
powers
of
imagination
will
not
produce
even
a
faint
picture
of
that
life
of
bliss
i
expected
to
enjoy
when
i
should
have
found
my
ideal
fair
one
for
whose
tenderness
i
preserved
my
heart
a
sanctuary
sacred
and
inviolate
what
then
had
been
my
faith
if
when
the
prototype
of
the
ideal
form
did
burst
upon
me
in
existence
i
had
been
the
chosen
above
all
mankind
of
a
heart
corresponding
in
all
things
with
my
own
sir
thomas
commanded
me
home
you
i
left
without
pain
to
him
i
returned
without
yes
i
returned
home
and
soon
it
was
men
clement
ay
then
it
was
you
say
i
advised
you
to
forget
her
in
other
arms
montgomery
why
did
i
advise
and
wherein
was
i
competent
to
judge
had
you
not
already
prepared
other
arms
to
open
for
your
reception
how
could
i
divine
that
she
whom
you
loved
was
not
of
the
race
of
those
beings
to
whom
you
were
constantly
lending
the
epithets
of
charming
lovely
exquisite
angelic
nought
beyond
a
glance
of
transient
admiration
or
a
temporary
delirium
of
the
senses
could
they
excite
in
me
i
sighed
to
find
something
worthy
of
remembrance
you
sighed
to
forget
the
worth
the
inestimable
worth
you
had
known
wearied
with
the
importunity
of
to
god
i
could
forget
her
forget
her
in
other
arms
i
most
readily
did
you
yield
to
the
advice
for
which
as
you
have
justly
said
in
one
of
your
letters
you
deserved
is
your
own
words
clement
you
deserved
damnation
and
what
art
thou
doing
now
now
even
that
she
has
sacrificed
herself
to
save
thee
from
despair
that
she
has
let
thy
heart
tell
thee
her
deserts
let
it
remind
thee
that
she
is
sorrowing
for
thy
safety
preparing
in
mind
and
affection
against
thy
return
ages
of
joy
of
felicity
such
as
never
merciful
heaven
and
thou
art
seeking
reconciliation
with
janetta
laundy
rememberest
thou
montgomery
the
terrific
and
awful
minutes
we
past
on
vesuvius
was
not
that
a
scene
which
while
it
gratified
curiosity
and
exhausted
wonder
made
nature
shrink
with
repugnance
from
the
situation
yet
in
all
the
horrors
of
a
night
worse
than
that
hour
lighted
only
by
the
flame
of
destruction
with
showers
of
thundering
dangers
obstructing
my
footsteps
yet
had
i
been
clement
would
i
have
climbed
that
summit
aye
and
precipitated
myself
into
the
gulph
of
ruin
rather
than
forever
blacken
the
fair
sheet
of
love
by
sinking
to
the
embraces
of
a
prostitute
oh
is
a
stain
indelible
will
all
great
neptune
ocean
wash
this
blood
clean
from
my
hand
no
this
my
hand
will
rather
the
multitudinous
sea
incarnadine
making
the
green
one
red
i
seek
not
to
quarrel
with
you
montgomery
careless
as
to
your
resentment
but
willing
still
to
possess
your
esteem
i
am
not
more
ready
to
declaim
against
your
errors
than
to
confess
my
own
your
are
recoverable
make
peace
with
yourself
and
heaven
while
i
go
not
to
expiate
but
patiently
to
abide
the
punishment
of
mine
this
is
the
last
time
clement
that
mystery
shall
cloud
my
words
and
in
this
very
letter
i
meant
to
have
cast
it
off
i
thought
i
had
torn
myself
for
ever
from
the
enchantment
and
that
reserve
and
secresy
were
at
an
end
but
a
strange
unexpected
circumstance
perchance
productive
of
benefit
to
those
for
whom
i
would
if
possible
sacrifice
more
than
self
leads
me
once
more
to
that
scene
where
my
dearest
wishes
lie
buried
where
i
raised
a
funeral
pile
of
all
my
hopes
of
happiness
in
this
world
was
i
conducted
the
fatal
torch
i
stood
passive
and
witnessed
their
annihilation
one
day
longer
shall
i
remain
at
barlowe
hall
i
only
arrived
here
yesterday
i
may
be
absent
a
week
then
i
return
again
for
a
short
time
to
seek
in
solitude
a
temporary
recruit
of
spirits
and
resolution
much
indeed
do
i
need
them
you
i
have
to
meet
my
uncle
too
all
who
call
themselves
my
friends
for
with
this
emaciated
form
and
mere
emaciated
mind
am
i
coming
to
london
and
what
is
my
business
there
to
take
an
everlasting
leave
of
ye
to
implore
sir
thomas
barlowe
that
he
will
allow
me
but
a
pat
of
the
ample
provision
he
has
given
me
here
to
supply
nature
necessities
in
a
foreign
i
go
abroad
opposition
and
remonstrances
are
a
feather
in
the
i
go
montgomery
to
find
a
life
and
i
are
already
separated
i
breathe
but
i
do
not
live
sleep
and
peace
are
vanished
from
me
how
swift
are
the
ravages
of
an
unhealthy
mind
and
who
would
not
rejoice
when
the
vague
and
fleeting
scene
shall
have
finally
closed
but
a
little
time
montgomery
and
rumour
will
say
or
perhaps
some
stranger
affected
into
sympathy
by
my
youth
will
as
the
least
office
of
humanity
charge
himself
particularly
to
inform
thee
that
it
was
a
sigh
of
resignation
which
liberated
the
agonized
soul
and
forever
sealed
the
lips
of
murden
letter
iii
from
sibella
valmont
to
caroline
ashburn
not
write
me
one
line
did
you
caroline
forbid
him
prudence
and
safety
required
no
such
sacrifice
last
night
i
dreamt
but
why
talk
of
dreams
when
waking
miseries
surround
us
why
need
we
recur
to
those
of
imagination
tell
clement
if
he
meant
a
triumph
tell
him
he
may
congratulate
himself
i
would
neither
conceal
nor
deny
he
has
it
most
here
then
i
in
full
conviction
that
clement
has
already
learned
a
part
of
valmont
lesson
i
yes
i
suffer
myself
to
be
commanded
into
acquiescence
against
which
every
fond
affection
of
my
soul
revolts
tell
clement
that
yet
stay
ask
thy
heart
sibella
that
heart
in
which
love
and
disappointment
mingle
the
bitter
poison
which
corrodes
the
very
vitals
of
thy
peace
whether
this
is
not
the
momentary
effusion
of
a
perhaps
unfounded
resentment
tell
him
not
caroline
or
if
thou
tellest
him
aught
and
i
do
commit
an
error
oh
may
the
tear
which
accompanies
prove
its
atonement
caroline
i
am
incompetent
to
judge
of
his
situation
cares
and
tumults
may
surround
him
and
add
to
the
anguish
of
and
you
my
friend
ah
beware
how
you
judge
him
rashly
the
tender
heart
of
clement
repels
every
approach
of
while
you
seek
to
investigate
you
forgot
to
i
detest
your
picture
of
my
clement
oh
how
ill
do
you
appreciate
that
soul
wherein
the
image
of
sibella
lives
immoveably
and
eternally
undivested
of
her
sway
by
any
outward
form
or
circumstance
is
true
indeed
clement
does
attach
to
success
and
fortune
in
the
world
a
value
unfelt
by
me
who
know
it
not
at
all
and
prized
by
you
only
perhaps
from
its
more
intimate
knowledge
but
for
whose
sake
is
it
caroline
that
he
dreads
my
uncle
resentment
that
he
would
shrink
to
see
me
a
pennyless
outcast
from
favour
is
it
not
is
i
that
am
however
distantly
removed
its
effects
from
all
but
the
discerning
eye
of
love
i
am
his
actuating
principle
does
he
ever
dismiss
this
one
dear
ultimate
object
from
his
thought
is
because
a
lesser
theme
mixing
therewith
would
degrade
the
loved
again
undisturbed
his
ardent
mind
returns
to
the
dear
remembrance
of
past
the
still
dearer
anticipation
of
future
joys
when
hourly
momentarily
they
shall
augment
with
the
increase
of
years
oh
clement
that
love
at
one
and
the
same
instant
created
on
our
sympathizing
hearts
sustained
with
mutual
ardor
through
the
uniform
but
interesting
years
of
childhood
at
length
spurred
on
by
dangers
and
denial
to
form
its
firmest
chastest
tie
is
there
a
temptation
on
earth
or
a
horror
in
futurity
which
could
bribe
or
bid
that
love
seek
to
extinguish
its
smallest
hope
its
least
particle
of
enjoyment
no
no
never
an
impassable
gulph
is
placed
between
that
love
and
a
chasm
wide
deep
immeasurable
as
eternity
how
dared
i
reproach
my
love
how
dared
i
decide
i
whose
mind
is
almost
subdued
by
my
situation
think
caroline
one
hour
heavily
creeps
after
its
fellowed
hour
day
slowly
succeeds
to
day
barely
distinguished
by
another
name
the
sun
shines
one
morning
and
hides
his
beam
the
next
yon
tall
trees
who
bow
their
heads
to
the
wind
on
this
side
may
wave
them
on
the
other
and
here
ends
the
chapter
of
my
night
indeed
brings
variety
amidst
endless
confusions
broken
sleep
and
apalling
visions
create
debility
of
mind
and
body
for
the
ensuing
dawn
it
is
but
the
fainting
embers
of
my
former
animation
that
sometimes
gleam
upon
the
darkness
of
my
soul
and
even
now
now
while
i
acknowledge
and
reprobate
my
folly
i
could
return
to
the
horrors
of
apprehension
could
run
through
volumes
of
dire
presages
affirming
while
i
disbelieved
creating
as
if
to
be
interwoven
in
my
fate
fantastic
shapeless
evils
from
which
my
better
reason
would
turn
and
would
pronounce
the
worthless
offspring
of
misrepresentation
and
falsehood
and
why
caroline
should
i
be
thus
there
is
the
question
that
as
often
as
i
impose
on
myself
as
often
returns
i
knew
clement
was
to
go
and
i
know
he
come
again
what
is
new
in
my
destiny
is
delightful
to
remembrance
it
is
the
sacred
union
plighted
by
our
willing
hearts
in
the
sight
of
heaven
the
confirmation
the
everlasting
bond
of
affection
which
renders
every
blessing
of
this
life
subordinate
from
which
no
change
of
circumstance
could
release
us
nor
not
even
death
itself
shall
cancel
i
heard
clement
speak
one
day
of
some
ceremonials
which
would
be
deemed
necessary
to
the
ratification
of
this
covenant
when
we
should
enter
the
methinks
i
shall
be
loath
to
submit
to
them
the
vow
of
the
heart
is
of
sacred
dignity
forms
and
ceremonies
seem
too
trifling
for
its
nature
but
of
the
customs
of
your
world
caroline
i
am
ignorant
i
write
at
intervals
a
giddiness
returns
upon
me
continually
and
air
is
the
only
remedy
the
last
time
i
quitted
my
pen
i
was
almost
overpowered
and
could
proceed
no
further
than
the
great
hall
door
i
sat
on
the
step
and
leaned
my
head
against
a
pillar
of
the
it
was
not
swooning
for
i
knew
i
was
i
felt
the
cold
wind
blow
on
my
face
but
my
limbs
had
lost
their
faculty
and
my
its
a
chill
oppressive
gripe
seemed
to
fasten
on
my
my
uncle
happened
to
pass
in
from
the
he
spoke
but
i
could
not
reply
i
waved
my
hand
which
he
took
in
his
but
while
he
pressed
it
he
reproved
me
in
an
ungentle
manner
for
sitting
on
the
damp
stone
and
exposed
to
the
raw
air
tears
unbidden
and
almost
unexcited
roll
down
my
cheeks
he
called
andrew
and
i
was
borne
in
and
laid
on
a
sopha
in
the
breakfast
parlour
after
i
recovered
my
uncle
with
a
kinder
tone
of
voice
noticed
an
appearance
of
ill
health
in
my
looks
and
enquired
into
the
nature
of
my
are
too
much
in
the
cold
child
said
i
give
you
permission
to
sit
with
valmont
i
will
join
you
there
presently
i
replied
i
was
engaged
in
my
most
interesting
employment
that
of
writing
to
you
child
said
my
uncle
much
do
you
stand
indebted
to
my
indulgence
for
that
liberty
i
rely
on
your
integrity
that
you
do
not
in
any
one
instance
sibella
abuse
my
confidence
i
was
going
to
answer
and
began
with
your
name
know
said
my
uncle
miss
ashburn
is
very
well
your
friendship
to
her
was
formed
by
accident
and
without
my
concurrence
but
i
had
never
suffered
it
to
continue
had
i
not
found
something
to
approve
in
miss
ashburn
she
has
sensibility
and
affection
that
is
all
you
ought
to
learn
the
rest
is
the
sad
licentiousness
of
her
education
i
could
have
made
her
a
charming
woman
and
as
it
is
she
has
too
much
feeling
for
the
companion
of
women
of
fashion
and
too
little
reserve
for
the
wife
of
a
man
of
delicacy
i
am
giving
orders
to
ross
sibella
he
is
sending
a
packet
to
clement
have
you
any
remembrances
for
your
friend
and
sir
as
most
befits
a
wife
to
a
husband
encouraged
by
the
complacency
of
his
eye
i
threw
myself
at
his
feet
and
assuredly
reserve
and
concealment
would
in
that
moment
have
vanished
had
not
valmont
placed
his
hand
on
my
mouth
hush
child
you
know
i
will
be
happiness
ceases
to
be
a
blessing
if
disappointment
does
not
precede
to
stamp
its
value
go
sibella
your
fate
in
the
husband
i
ordain
for
you
may
not
be
as
desperate
as
you
at
present
perhaps
imagine
repeat
this
to
clement
caroline
a
thousand
times
let
him
fix
his
comment
and
then
judge
of
the
throbbing
expectation
of
my
heart
by
his
own
how
insensibly
my
pen
glides
into
this
dear
engrossing
subject
i
began
this
letter
almost
for
the
sole
purpose
of
telling
you
i
am
no
longer
a
stranger
to
the
as
you
call
him
and
i
have
travelled
through
these
number
of
lines
without
his
idea
having
recurred
to
my
memory
from
the
night
of
the
sigh
and
little
ball
i
sacrificed
the
first
of
my
present
enjoyments
and
entered
the
wood
no
more
the
opposite
hill
from
whence
issues
the
parent
spring
of
the
lake
forms
a
shelter
to
the
little
park
a
spot
of
ground
left
in
its
rude
state
to
produce
furze
for
the
accommodation
of
our
deer
twice
a
day
for
nina
sake
i
ascended
the
hill
sometimes
she
appeared
instantly
from
the
little
oftner
after
i
had
called
loud
and
long
she
would
come
panting
from
the
wood
but
our
meetings
were
less
congenial
than
at
the
foot
of
our
nina
would
bound
that
way
suddenly
stop
and
look
wistfully
from
me
to
the
wood
thus
as
it
were
conjuring
my
return
to
that
beloved
spot
where
she
used
to
share
her
fond
caresses
between
clement
and
myself
and
spring
from
one
embrace
to
be
received
in
the
other
one
afternoon
nina
appeared
on
my
first
call
and
as
i
stooped
to
embrace
her
i
observed
a
folded
paper
tied
to
the
plate
of
her
collar
it
contained
only
wood
is
free
farewel
for
ever
that
nina
should
become
such
a
messenger
must
be
i
concluded
by
the
order
of
valmont
and
the
contrivance
of
a
servant
for
you
caroline
experienced
how
inflexibly
averse
nina
is
to
strangers
even
to
the
domestics
of
the
castle
i
never
saw
her
more
complacent
i
felt
grateful
for
the
tidings
though
i
smiled
to
think
my
uncle
should
thus
continually
strive
to
perplex
and
mislead
my
imagination
it
was
now
near
the
close
of
gathering
clouds
and
fierce
gusts
of
wind
foretold
a
tempest
instead
of
going
to
the
wood
i
returned
to
the
castle
and
scarcely
was
i
housed
when
the
storm
burst
in
its
most
tremendous
violence
you
remember
the
apartment
where
my
portrait
hangs
and
you
have
remarked
the
attractions
of
that
picture
for
me
as
the
work
of
clement
it
is
rather
his
image
than
my
own
there
i
can
vent
the
swelling
sentiment
of
my
heart
and
find
an
auditor
more
interested
than
the
dispersing
winds
to
this
room
and
picture
i
resorted
in
the
dead
of
that
night
to
harmonize
my
feelings
and
collect
my
thoughts
alarmed
and
scattered
by
a
twice
repeated
dream
full
of
terror
and
dismay
there
i
met
a
stranger
i
looked
on
him
intensely
for
i
sought
to
discover
the
likeness
of
whom
you
describe
i
sought
to
recollect
the
features
i
had
seen
in
the
wood
and
armoury
height
and
form
agreed
with
your
description
and
my
remembrance
but
the
countenance
of
this
young
man
was
devoid
of
softness
and
i
thought
possessed
little
interest
he
had
vivacious
dark
eyes
dark
hair
and
a
full
decided
bloom
the
impression
of
former
circumstances
was
still
powerful
in
my
mind
i
remembered
the
paper
i
had
found
on
collar
and
i
concluded
that
this
person
could
be
no
other
than
valmont
chosen
i
addressed
him
accordingly
i
spoke
of
the
weakness
of
his
endeavours
i
defied
his
utmost
power
twice
the
stranger
bowed
in
silence
but
he
never
attempted
to
answer
me
early
the
succeeding
morning
i
decided
on
going
to
the
wood
should
it
be
free
what
a
pleasure
should
the
stranger
be
there
i
had
only
to
repeat
in
a
fuller
manner
the
sense
of
my
last
night
words
and
quit
him
oh
caroline
had
you
ever
loved
but
love
itself
without
separation
could
not
have
taught
you
the
omnipotent
value
a
lover
heart
affixes
to
time
place
and
memory
who
in
revisiting
the
hallowed
ground
of
affection
can
describe
that
slow
eagerness
of
step
that
still
tumult
of
delight
which
restrains
while
it
impels
purchasing
delay
if
these
are
not
the
happiest
moments
of
life
at
least
they
are
most
worthy
living
for
the
soul
expands
into
a
new
existence
the
encumbering
mass
seems
no
longer
her
organ
even
now
caroline
the
charm
returns
infusing
itself
through
every
vein
sending
life
best
blood
in
thrills
to
the
heart
enkindling
pleasure
into
agony
i
can
not
will
not
clement
write
me
one
line
another
letter
shall
inform
you
in
what
manner
i
discovered
him
for
the
personated
hermit
is
your
murden
sibella
letter
iv
from
the
same
to
the
same
i
know
not
precisely
where
to
begin
nor
how
much
of
the
adventure
i
told
you
in
my
last
did
i
not
say
that
while
yet
at
my
oak
nina
entered
the
wood
a
little
below
the
tomb
and
without
observing
me
began
to
climb
the
rock
but
i
think
i
broke
off
before
i
had
mentioned
her
swift
return
at
my
call
and
the
irresolution
she
betrayed
by
running
backward
and
forward
from
me
to
the
rock
and
from
the
rock
back
again
to
me
desirous
to
know
what
her
manner
portended
i
arose
as
if
to
follow
and
away
she
bounded
taking
the
path
up
to
the
hermitage
as
she
ascended
much
swifter
than
i
could
she
waited
on
the
outer
side
of
the
ruin
till
i
also
arrived
and
then
bent
her
course
round
to
the
farther
part
which
being
the
most
perfect
of
the
building
i
imagined
she
had
chosen
for
the
purpose
of
sheltering
her
young
ones
it
is
called
the
chapel
standing
on
a
projecting
point
of
the
rock
it
is
difficult
of
access
for
the
path
is
cumbered
with
loose
stones
from
one
to
the
other
of
which
runs
in
perplexing
branches
the
twining
ivy
high
grass
and
clusters
of
bramble
choak
the
wild
flowers
that
shed
their
inviting
fragrance
on
part
of
the
lower
side
of
the
rock
nor
do
i
remember
ever
but
twice
before
to
have
gone
beyond
the
unroofed
cell
where
clement
and
i
one
happy
spring
morning
raised
a
seat
of
stone
and
plucked
away
the
weeds
that
new
springing
grass
might
mingle
with
our
mossy
there
too
we
planted
a
woodbine
rose
and
jassamine
but
the
cell
refused
nourishment
to
our
favorites
foiled
in
our
attempt
to
make
the
ruin
bloom
a
garden
it
had
no
longer
for
us
any
attractions
nina
wistful
look
as
she
again
stopped
at
the
chapel
entrance
now
tempted
me
on
but
it
could
tempt
me
no
farther
at
the
stairs
my
curiosity
or
at
least
all
inclination
to
gratify
it
terminated
in
one
corner
of
this
small
chapel
where
the
wall
is
yet
undecayed
remains
a
kind
of
altar
some
stones
in
front
have
falled
away
and
discover
a
flight
of
dark
narrow
steps
i
concluded
nina
had
concealed
her
young
in
the
vault
below
for
she
would
not
return
when
i
called
but
i
could
not
think
of
encountering
i
knew
not
what
damp
and
darkness
in
the
hope
of
finding
them
both
suppositions
were
erroneous
the
cell
is
superior
in
dimensions
and
dryness
to
those
above
ground
nor
had
my
fawn
any
offspring
there
this
place
caroline
was
murden
abode
thence
he
ascended
followed
by
nina
and
stood
before
me
the
original
of
your
painting
and
the
same
who
once
in
the
wood
started
from
every
appearance
of
feeble
age
into
youth
and
vigour
he
named
himself
valmont
said
he
no
longer
bear
a
borrowed
character
henceforward
should
you
ever
think
of
me
know
i
am
murden
the
friend
of
clement
montgomery
and
the
acquaintance
i
dare
not
say
more
of
your
miss
ashburn
already
the
victim
of
unsuccessful
love
by
all
my
hopes
of
heaven
i
came
hither
only
to
seek
your
consolations
the
world
can
not
find
time
to
sooth
a
breaking
heart
you
in
solitude
might
but
you
have
no
pity
no
friendship
an
accident
keeps
me
here
this
day
or
i
had
now
been
gone
for
ever
do
not
miss
valmont
do
not
set
your
people
of
the
castle
to
hunt
me
for
i
am
desperate
victim
are
you
said
i
repeated
he
loudly
and
wildly
you
say
whose
miss
valmont
then
turning
away
and
sinking
his
voice
he
said
whose
indeed
do
you
know
added
he
approaching
nearer
to
me
death
is
of
icy
coldness
the
eye
beams
no
tidings
for
the
heart
feels
no
warmth
such
is
my
love
to
me
tell
me
miss
valmont
what
would
you
do
were
clement
thus
die
also
brave
said
murden
with
a
strange
kind
of
smile
witness
thou
unhallowed
gloomy
mansion
for
one
one
moment
of
our
lives
are
we
agreed
miss
valmont
i
shall
never
see
you
more
if
i
have
created
uneasiness
in
your
breast
by
my
strange
visits
to
this
spot
forgive
and
forget
it
ask
me
no
questions
in
some
hour
of
less
anguish
than
the
present
i
will
tell
miss
ashburn
how
and
why
i
came
hither
another
person
there
is
also
to
whom
i
shall
owe
the
hold
for
i
was
going
to
speak
not
name
him
your
last
words
were
also
to
me
your
last
choicest
blessing
no
no
i
will
not
hear
you
speak
again
this
is
our
final
in
peace
and
safety
miss
valmont
return
to
your
wood
and
when
remembrances
of
love
shall
be
no
longer
remembrances
of
happiness
then
and
who
caroline
could
outlive
their
remembrances
of
happiness
i
have
placed
myself
one
minute
in
the
situation
of
this
unfortunate
young
man
i
beheld
the
tomb
close
upon
the
lifeless
form
of
clement
and
in
the
wide
world
there
was
no
longer
room
for
me
murden
descended
to
his
cell
and
i
went
home
to
weep
for
him
will
not
you
weep
for
him
my
friend
and
clement
too
i
feel
you
will
clement
knows
full
well
the
value
of
requited
affection
he
will
sooth
his
friend
but
he
will
not
ask
him
to
live
it
would
be
cruelty
nina
looked
kindly
at
me
but
she
followed
murden
and
since
he
quitted
that
abode
i
often
see
her
descending
the
rock
she
even
appears
to
mourn
his
absence
and
she
looks
around
expectingly
and
starts
at
every
gust
of
wind
as
she
used
when
clement
first
bade
us
adieu
either
to
you
or
clement
i
appeal
for
the
further
history
of
your
drooping
friend
bid
clement
write
be
it
only
three
words
my
and
i
will
wear
it
next
my
heart
a
charm
to
hold
disease
and
foreboding
at
defiance
my
dearest
friend
farewel
sibella
valmont
letter
v
from
arthur
murden
to
caroline
ashburn
when
friendship
and
advice
can
no
longer
avail
him
murden
intreats
a
patient
ear
to
the
history
of
his
misfortunes
intreat
did
he
say
no
madam
he
intreats
nothing
of
you
he
demands
your
ear
demands
your
attention
your
sighs
your
sorrow
and
little
indeed
is
that
though
your
all
of
reparation
for
the
mischievous
eloquence
which
first
instigated
him
to
become
the
poor
valueless
object
of
pity
sighs
and
sorrow
to
tell
you
that
i
love
sibella
valmont
is
no
more
than
montgomery
will
tell
you
but
he
loves
her
in
his
i
in
mine
when
present
her
supreme
and
every
varying
beauty
makes
his
rapture
and
till
he
has
been
a
day
without
her
he
imagines
absence
would
be
absent
or
present
alike
she
fills
my
every
vein
i
love
her
miss
ashburn
as
oh
misery
as
she
loves
clement
judge
me
not
so
absurd
as
to
entertain
hope
although
i
tell
you
i
am
again
returned
to
the
hermit
cell
offer
hope
in
its
most
seducing
form
and
still
would
i
renounce
it
yes
madam
possession
of
sibella
were
i
an
atom
less
to
her
than
she
is
to
me
must
inflict
torture
worse
than
the
present
nor
deem
that
i
would
dare
assail
her
ears
with
my
unauspicious
love
i
have
spoken
in
mystery
and
she
thinks
i
mourn
a
buried
alas
and
so
i
do
montgomery
what
dost
thou
owe
me
yet
was
not
thee
i
meant
to
serve
therefore
thou
owest
me
nothing
thou
canst
find
happiness
any
where
but
in
the
circle
of
thy
arms
and
heart
centres
the
full
measure
of
sibella
wishes
i
would
almost
miss
ashburn
as
soon
have
rushed
into
the
fire
as
again
sustained
the
chilling
beam
of
her
eye
yet
i
have
come
hither
again
have
endured
this
and
more
to
check
the
carniverous
meal
of
anxiety
already
begun
on
her
cheek
bloom
i
have
been
told
and
have
told
sibella
that
instead
of
being
a
dependent
on
her
uncle
she
is
mistress
of
fifty
thousand
pounds
with
infinite
astonishment
she
heard
me
and
is
gone
to
demand
an
explanation
of
valmont
i
requested
her
to
forbear
naming
me
till
i
had
made
a
safe
retreat
from
the
park
for
valmont
is
proud
insolent
and
cruel
and
she
bade
me
wait
her
return
here
that
according
to
reception
of
the
tidings
i
as
clement
friend
might
yield
her
my
prompt
advice
yes
as
clement
friend
she
said
ah
well
may
i
talk
of
endurance
when
i
first
knew
you
madam
at
barlowe
hall
you
won
my
admiration
and
esteem
by
the
uniform
reserve
or
i
may
say
repugnance
of
your
manners
toward
me
i
adored
your
disdain
of
a
character
i
equally
disdained
while
i
contemptibly
descended
to
wear
it
and
though
i
could
not
instantly
resolve
to
cast
aside
the
unmerited
fame
of
my
licentiousness
yet
you
never
moved
or
spoke
that
i
was
not
all
eye
and
ear
however
you
might
contemn
the
abettor
of
impertinence
and
folly
in
lady
margaret
and
lady
laura
bowden
one
evening
you
may
remember
i
abruptly
shook
off
those
interrupters
who
wore
in
my
view
while
they
delivered
their
invidious
suppositions
concerning
the
lovely
being
whose
picture
you
had
so
animatedly
when
your
eulogium
on
sibella
valmont
ceased
i
withdrew
flew
to
my
chamber
and
hastily
locked
the
door
as
if
i
had
newly
found
treasure
to
deposit
there
in
secresy
i
threw
myself
into
a
chair
is
not
all
this
familiar
to
thee
murden
said
i
after
a
pause
thou
not
a
thousand
and
a
thousand
times
in
thy
waking
and
sleeping
visions
described
a
being
thus
artless
thus
feminine
yet
firm
such
an
daughter
of
wisdom
ay
but
i
had
never
personified
her
in
sibella
valmont
though
clement
had
sworn
ten
thousand
fathom
deeper
to
her
beauty
i
could
make
no
more
nor
less
of
it
my
head
ached
and
my
soul
was
burthened
i
went
to
bed
and
dreamt
of
a
wilderness
and
an
angel
and
the
vision
followed
me
through
the
engagements
of
the
succeeding
day
whether
it
was
that
i
more
industriously
fought
it
than
formerly
i
know
not
but
soon
an
opportunity
arose
of
conversing
with
you
alone
it
was
easy
to
lead
to
a
theme
wherein
your
affections
were
as
much
engaged
as
my
curiosity
and
i
heard
every
interesting
particular
of
her
mind
manners
and
seclusion
her
love
of
clement
montgomery
was
also
remembered
to
me
his
love
of
her
never
bore
any
striking
features
and
somehow
her
to
him
seldom
intruded
amidst
my
chimeras
strange
wishes
arose
tremulous
expectations
is
all
curiosity
said
i
to
overcome
the
obstacles
that
forbid
thy
knowledge
of
this
phoenix
is
worthy
the
labour
of
ingenuity
when
you
madam
took
the
road
to
bath
i
unattended
crossed
the
country
to
valmont
castle
three
days
i
passed
in
reviving
and
rejecting
the
scheme
and
during
that
time
had
stationed
myself
at
a
within
a
mile
of
valmont
in
the
farmer
i
recognized
an
old
of
my
day
of
humility
and
one
whom
i
loved
dearly
too
before
my
uncle
was
a
nabob
we
met
each
other
with
an
appearance
of
restraint
and
embarrassment
i
certainly
conscious
of
an
unjust
neglect
of
him
he
perhaps
secretly
despising
the
man
who
preferred
wealth
to
honesty
but
reparation
was
then
in
my
power
and
the
very
critical
moment
at
hand
farmer
richardson
is
rather
given
to
endure
than
to
complain
his
simple
statement
of
a
few
facts
which
led
to
the
service
i
rendered
him
contained
no
invective
told
me
he
was
an
unfortunate
man
to
be
sure
but
valmont
was
not
obliged
to
know
that
as
to
family
concerns
at
the
castle
after
which
i
enquired
he
said
had
occasionally
heard
more
than
he
chose
to
relate
that
the
was
perhaps
proud
and
capricious
but
he
might
have
reasons
for
his
conduct
let
every
man
act
according
to
his
own
conscience
and
the
lord
have
mercy
on
the
greatest
sinner
such
is
honest
richardson
creed
the
farmer
taciturnity
was
amply
contrasted
by
the
loquacity
of
his
hind
formerly
a
domestic
at
the
castle
and
suddenly
discharged
with
that
pride
and
petulance
for
which
its
owner
is
john
thomas
dwelt
at
when
clement
montgomery
was
adopted
when
miss
valmont
was
brought
thither
and
though
i
always
made
him
begin
there
he
constantly
found
means
to
shift
his
ground
to
the
ancient
mysteries
of
the
domain
sinful
lord
turned
penitent
enjoined
to
find
money
and
materials
for
the
structure
it
pleased
a
neighbouring
society
of
devout
fathers
to
erect
on
the
rock
within
the
park
it
was
further
necessary
to
his
salvation
that
this
hermitage
should
be
endowed
on
two
of
the
most
holy
monks
of
the
brotherhood
who
would
undertake
to
live
longest
by
prayer
and
fasting
the
event
proved
the
choice
admirably
founded
without
the
adventitious
aid
of
victuals
and
drink
they
dwelt
i
know
not
what
number
of
years
in
this
practice
of
piety
saw
the
society
from
whence
they
came
broken
and
dispersed
and
peaceably
ended
their
days
in
the
hermitage
selfish
fellows
though
these
saints
according
to
john
thomas
for
dead
they
will
not
yield
possession
to
the
living
but
revisit
still
the
glimpses
of
the
moon
making
night
horrible
i
essayed
to
gain
information
concerning
miss
valmont
and
john
deduction
from
the
little
he
had
seen
and
the
more
he
had
heard
was
that
miss
had
not
a
right
understanding
he
always
thought
master
montgomery
better
natured
of
the
two
and
he
would
be
a
fine
fortune
when
he
came
back
from
foreign
countries
legends
of
the
haunted
ruin
on
which
john
thomas
delighted
to
dwell
first
suggested
to
me
a
hermit
disguise
already
miss
ashburn
you
contemn
the
romance
of
my
scheme
and
its
practicability
seems
impossible
in
expectation
experience
taught
me
how
much
a
little
ingenuity
and
great
perseverance
will
effect
in
all
cases
whether
of
right
or
wrong
jointly
they
can
almost
work
miracles
early
misfortunes
a
life
of
hard
labour
and
little
profit
had
blunted
that
quickness
of
sensation
in
farmer
richardson
which
might
have
led
him
to
conjecture
something
mysterious
of
me
if
i
was
there
to
claim
my
meals
it
was
well
if
not
was
the
same
i
contrived
to
evade
all
enquiries
into
my
absence
whether
it
were
of
the
night
or
day
by
fixing
on
myself
the
character
of
an
eccentric
whimsical
solitary
ah
miss
ashburn
i
smile
to
observe
the
precaution
and
industry
wherewith
i
wrought
my
wretchedness
you
allow
me
to
be
minute
i
know
for
i
know
your
sympathy
and
sincerity
how
this
recapitulation
of
events
has
beguiled
from
me
the
consciousness
of
passing
time
in
this
cell
where
no
ray
of
the
light
ever
penetrated
have
i
by
my
solitary
lamp
counted
the
lagging
moments
throughout
a
day
yet
now
living
over
again
in
remembrance
that
preparatory
fortnight
when
i
was
at
farmer
richardson
was
only
restless
i
have
suffered
hours
to
go
by
without
any
additional
torment
of
suspended
expectation
sibella
is
not
returned
i
thought
i
heard
the
sound
of
her
feet
in
the
chapel
above
but
when
i
ascended
she
was
not
there
i
went
on
to
the
other
side
but
darkness
has
enveloped
the
castle
wood
and
park
i
shall
not
see
her
then
valmont
may
be
from
home
occupied
or
engaged
and
she
can
not
gain
an
hearing
nina
too
has
quitted
me
yet
i
am
less
alone
than
heretofore
the
spirit
of
your
friendship
hovers
round
me
be
my
friend
miss
ashburn
while
existence
cleaves
to
me
and
when
i
am
gone
double
the
portion
of
your
love
to
ah
me
my
heart
has
strange
forebodings
that
she
will
greatly
need
it
a
continuation
of
my
narrative
shall
amuse
the
sleepless
night
who
will
dispute
that
my
claim
to
saintship
is
not
more
incontestible
than
that
of
the
former
fasting
inhabitants
of
this
mansion
the
holy
monks
by
their
mysterious
passages
into
the
castle
could
and
assuredly
did
indemnify
themselves
at
night
for
the
forbearance
of
the
day
but
i
who
have
learned
in
this
cell
and
its
invirons
to
banish
sleep
one
of
nature
greatest
wants
where
shall
i
seek
the
lulling
medicine
which
can
steal
me
from
self
can
anticipate
the
tomb
during
the
fortnight
previous
to
my
first
seeing
miss
valmont
i
reconnoitred
day
after
day
every
inch
of
ground
around
the
moat
and
a
first
circuit
showed
me
that
immediately
beside
the
rock
the
moat
forming
an
angle
is
not
above
a
third
part
as
broad
as
in
any
other
place
this
of
course
rendered
it
much
easier
to
cross
but
that
facility
was
more
than
counterbalanced
by
the
abruptness
of
the
bank
on
the
side
next
the
lane
and
the
slippery
steepness
of
the
rock
on
the
park
side
still
this
seemed
the
place
from
its
great
privacy
and
difficulty
of
access
by
which
i
must
enter
never
but
once
did
i
see
any
creature
approach
it
and
then
i
saw
a
gentleman
on
the
opposite
hill
who
seemed
to
have
lost
his
way
the
exactness
and
solicitude
of
my
observations
at
length
pointed
out
a
tolerable
and
easy
method
of
descending
the
bank
for
i
perceived
stumps
of
trees
irregularly
but
artfully
disposed
which
i
dare
believe
had
been
either
purposely
placed
or
purposely
left
there
for
the
climber
assistance
at
first
this
surprised
me
however
the
whole
business
was
fully
explained
when
measuring
the
depth
of
the
moat
in
separate
places
i
discovered
and
blessed
the
saintly
contrivance
of
the
starving
monks
a
mound
raised
across
the
moat
about
two
feet
below
its
surface
on
which
large
pieces
of
the
rock
were
thrown
their
edges
just
covered
with
water
so
that
with
the
assistance
of
my
pole
i
could
pass
from
one
to
the
other
suffering
little
more
inconvenience
than
a
wet
shoe
of
your
worthy
successor
exclaimed
i
i
receive
the
benefit
of
your
labours
your
work
no
doubt
is
perfect
in
ingenuity
i
shall
tread
in
your
steps
up
the
mountain
rugged
side
and
nightly
visit
my
shrine
as
you
nightly
deserted
yours
yes
miss
ashburn
the
ascent
was
attainable
and
though
time
has
destroyed
some
of
the
useful
works
of
the
holy
fathers
yet
here
and
there
particularly
in
the
more
abrupt
parts
of
the
rock
i
found
steps
formed
by
diligent
heed
of
these
and
other
aids
i
certainly
gained
the
only
path
by
which
i
could
have
reached
my
destination
it
brought
me
on
the
back
of
the
hermitage
to
the
chapel
entrance
which
if
you
have
at
all
noticed
its
situation
you
will
recollect
to
be
so
placed
that
any
one
may
enter
it
without
being
discovered
from
the
wood
or
even
from
the
park
side
of
the
rock
i
will
not
tell
no
i
can
not
tell
you
the
swelling
joy
with
which
i
hailed
myself
master
of
the
ruin
it
commands
no
prospect
save
of
the
where
stands
valmont
monument
and
a
dearer
object
sibella
oak
yet
i
bent
my
eager
view
through
the
chapel
cracked
wall
and
bade
the
winds
bear
to
the
castle
owner
my
proud
defiance
this
my
first
visit
performed
at
twilight
was
only
a
visit
of
inspection
i
discovered
the
stairs
under
the
altar
but
deemed
it
at
least
improper
if
not
dangerous
to
explore
them
without
light
all
my
apparatus
were
forthwith
conveyed
to
the
where
rushes
afforded
them
an
hiding
place
till
i
had
carried
them
to
my
station
a
few
biskets
alone
was
my
provender
but
for
the
supply
of
my
dark
lantern
i
was
abundantly
careful
no
monarch
ever
ascended
a
throne
with
more
bounding
exultation
than
that
which
filled
my
breast
when
i
took
possession
of
this
lower
cell
the
next
day
i
saw
good
god
and
you
have
seen
her
too
at
the
foot
of
her
oak
her
flowing
hair
her
modest
drapery
a
model
for
the
sculptor
a
vision
for
the
poet
i
became
neither
were
i
to
live
ages
i
could
never
describe
her
for
when
her
image
is
most
perfect
with
me
i
have
neither
powers
of
mind
nor
the
common
faculties
of
nature
the
overwhelming
sensation
sinks
me
to
the
earth
montgomery
she
may
live
in
thy
imagination
but
not
in
thy
heart
as
in
mine
surely
i
grow
tedious
in
detail
these
occurrences
were
few
yet
they
swell
in
relation
three
days
elapsed
ere
she
came
again
to
her
wood
doubtless
madam
you
have
already
heard
of
our
feared
me
not
she
left
me
to
inform
mr
in
the
first
moment
of
our
intercourse
i
saw
the
firmness
of
her
character
i
saw
she
knew
not
how
to
threaten
she
could
only
reason
and
resolve
i
dared
not
quit
the
hermitage
in
day
light
but
i
could
provide
for
my
safety
within
it
walking
backward
and
forward
in
my
cell
for
exercise
one
stone
of
the
flooring
had
constantly
resounded
under
my
footsteps
and
as
i
trod
harder
it
appeared
loosened
from
the
rest
grave
or
a
treasure
said
i
and
i
raised
the
stone
there
was
only
a
flight
of
steps
three
times
as
wide
as
those
descending
from
the
chapel
as
i
now
trod
the
ground
of
mystery
this
discovery
excited
no
surprise
and
imagining
myself
securely
and
conveniently
stationed
in
the
cell
i
had
not
the
smallest
inclination
to
explore
further
till
hearing
the
voices
of
people
on
the
rock
who
i
doubted
not
were
coming
in
search
of
me
i
committed
myself
with
my
lantern
to
the
subterraneous
passage
finding
it
well
arched
dry
and
wide
curiosity
led
me
on
for
i
no
sooner
discovered
it
than
i
conjectured
its
secret
communication
with
some
apartment
of
the
castle
it
is
unnecessary
miss
ashburn
to
dwell
on
the
construction
of
this
passage
its
ascents
and
descents
windings
suffice
it
to
say
that
it
seemed
a
journey
of
infinite
length
that
the
crumbling
fragments
of
one
broken
arch
had
nigh
forbidden
my
progress
and
finally
that
this
difficulty
overcome
a
sliding
pannel
of
oak
incomparably
fitted
gave
me
admission
into
the
armoury
from
amidst
the
surrounding
trophies
of
honour
i
snatched
a
sword
determined
therewith
to
defend
myself
against
any
direct
attack
in
the
armoury
i
remained
all
that
night
for
i
thought
it
possible
that
someone
might
be
stationed
to
watch
for
me
in
the
cell
shall
i
not
tell
you
that
a
feeling
which
surmounted
my
apprehensions
of
discovery
chained
me
to
the
armoury
i
was
under
the
same
roof
with
sibella
the
first
dawnings
of
morn
burst
imperfectly
through
the
high
and
grated
casements
and
i
heard
the
creaking
door
of
the
armoury
begin
to
open
i
darted
through
my
pannel
but
the
pannel
shut
heavily
and
with
noise
some
person
had
already
entered
the
armoury
ere
the
pannel
was
quite
closed
i
shuddered
for
the
consequences
that
might
ensue
and
i
retreated
a
few
steps
and
grasped
my
sword
i
heard
the
person
in
the
armoury
walk
and
several
times
pass
the
pannel
the
step
was
light
and
gentle
i
heard
a
sigh
my
heart
took
the
prompt
alarm
i
looked
through
the
crevice
it
was
i
had
almost
said
my
sibella
no
sibella
i
forced
back
the
panel
flew
to
her
trembled
spoke
was
wild
vehement
and
perhaps
utterly
unintelligible
and
here
let
me
pause
miss
ashburn
to
remark
how
strongly
i
discovered
in
her
mind
i
had
pictured
and
panted
to
possess
when
i
first
approached
her
in
the
wood
tottering
under
a
hermit
disguise
i
could
perceive
as
it
were
her
collecting
spirits
embody
themselves
to
repel
my
fraud
matters
little
to
me
said
she
or
what
you
are
since
i
well
know
you
can
not
be
what
you
would
seem
conscious
rectitude
forbade
her
to
fear
me
it
forbade
her
to
mix
me
with
her
ideas
in
one
shape
all
her
all
prevalent
love
forbade
it
in
i
saw
her
once
when
the
time
the
place
the
circumstance
would
have
appalled
me
into
agony
when
unseen
i
echoed
her
bursting
sigh
from
behind
the
monument
i
saw
her
a
moment
mute
with
surprise
then
call
into
her
mien
a
dignity
so
firm
so
undaunted
that
it
might
have
spoken
lessons
to
a
hero
after
miss
valmont
left
me
in
the
armoury
i
waited
another
hour
and
assuring
myself
from
the
still
silence
that
prevailed
my
passage
was
undiscovered
i
returned
to
my
cell
which
i
believe
none
had
entered
since
i
quitted
the
succeeding
night
i
revisited
farmer
richardson
john
thomas
ever
delighted
to
talk
came
on
me
with
a
tale
newly
brought
from
the
castle
namely
that
miss
valmont
had
seen
and
spoken
with
the
hermit
ghost
in
the
wood
and
next
madam
to
prevent
suspicion
and
enquiry
i
deemed
it
proper
to
join
you
and
my
uncle
party
at
bath
there
in
the
midst
of
the
crowds
was
i
alone
i
saw
but
one
form
i
heard
but
one
voice
i
began
to
despise
montgomery
to
assure
myself
against
conviction
that
she
did
not
could
not
love
him
and
had
promised
my
heart
i
know
not
what
of
success
and
felicity
when
the
contrast
past
his
letter
came
and
i
in
the
saloon
in
your
presence
before
a
crowd
of
witnesses
behaved
like
a
fool
and
a
madman
pardon
miss
ashburn
in
consideration
of
my
despair
any
surprise
or
shock
my
conduct
gave
you
never
can
you
know
what
were
the
feelings
of
that
night
love
had
no
concern
therewith
it
was
a
night
of
hatred
revenge
and
rage
adieu
madam
i
have
filled
up
the
last
space
of
my
paper
and
my
narrative
must
rest
till
i
return
to
the
farm
the
blessings
of
an
uncorrupted
mind
ever
ever
be

murden
letter
vi
from
the
same
to
the
same
in
continuation
four
and
twenty
hours
longer
of
fruitless
expectation
did
i
endure
in
that
cell
no
sibella
appeared
did
she
then
forget
her
request
painting
her
future
delights
with
montgomery
has
she
forgotten
the
unblessed
wretch
who
for
her
sake
could
sustain
hunger
and
cold
watching
and
weariness
who
to
hail
the
same
breeze
that
had
saluted
her
quitted
every
indulgence
of
luxury
for
an
abode
that
held
comfort
at
defiance
who
stretched
himself
along
the
bare
stone
rather
than
on
a
bed
of
down
because
from
that
sleepless
couch
he
could
spring
to
gain
an
indistinct
view
of
her
bewitching
form
ay
pour
your
contempt
upon
me
ye
whose
smiles
i
have
beguiled
you
of
view
him
who
bought
your
unprized
tenderness
with
the
empty
breath
of
flattery
view
him
stealing
into
forbidden
paths
only
to
gaze
at
humble
distance
only
to
catch
the
echo
of
a
sigh
a
sigh
breathed
to
another
he
miss
ashburn
who
lives
without
hope
must
for
consolation
yet
surely
this
her
absence
can
not
arise
from
so
more
than
common
an
instance
of
insensibility
some
accident
may
have
prevented
her
return
and
i
am
capricious
and
cruel
while
i
dare
to
accuse
her
of
insensibility
john
thomas
met
me
as
i
returned
to
the
farm
he
was
carrying
malt
to
the
castle
i
will
throw
myself
in
his
way
when
he
comes
home
and
probably
amidst
the
abundance
of
information
he
will
be
eager
to
communicate
i
may
find
something
which
will
elucidate
this
strange
absence
of
miss
valmont
little
remains
madam
for
me
to
add
to
my
confessions
sibella
tender
but
romantic
contract
placed
an
eternal
barrier
between
me
and
the
flattering
illusions
wherewith
fancy
fled
my
flame
i
saw
she
loved
as
i
had
wished
her
to
love
had
i
been
the
object
in
the
first
moments
of
phrenzy
i
wrote
montgomery
a
mad
letter
and
no
sooner
recovered
a
better
frame
of
mind
than
i
dispatched
one
of
apology
which
both
made
my
peace
and
quieted
his
astonishment
for
he
is
not
given
to
look
beyond
the
surface
hours
miss
ashburn
have
i
spent
in
wishing
montgomery
worthier
of
his
fate
sometimes
have
i
calmed
my
swelling
agony
by
reproaching
her
for
loving
him
then
have
humbled
my
proud
heart
to
dust
to
obtain
her
ideal
pardon
her
seclusion
her
enthusiasm
his
reducing
countenance
his
vivacity
of
spirit
and
above
all
his
well
expressed
vehemence
of
love
oh
it
could
not
be
otherwise
she
saw
an
outline
her
imagination
formed
the
rest
no
not
one
single
instance
of
on
clement
account
ever
assailed
me
when
i
first
discovered
that
montgomery
beloved
was
the
selected
friend
of
miss
ashburn
i
then
knew
they
might
be
paired
but
never
mated
to
rival
him
with
one
woman
methought
could
be
little
injury
when
in
her
absence
twenty
others
equally
could
charm
after
miss
valmont
had
irrevocably
given
herself
to
clement
i
resolved
to
travel
for
to
the
antipodes
would
i
have
journeyed
rather
than
met
montgomery
yet
i
tutored
my
heart
into
the
supposition
that
i
still
had
a
friendship
for
that
sibella
had
injured
me
and
was
now
not
a
jot
beyond
my
friend
or
my
friend
wife
dwelling
on
the
delusion
it
insensibly
produced
a
desire
when
clement
went
to
london
of
returning
to
my
hermitage
to
her
park
in
order
to
behold
her
with
firm
composure
with
almost
victim
that
i
am
can
do
her
service
said
i
to
myself
i
can
prevent
her
suspecting
aught
of
the
former
intruder
wishes
she
must
have
something
to
alleviate
the
tedious
uniformity
of
her
existence
and
numberless
plans
to
gratify
and
amuse
her
without
my
having
any
apparent
concern
therein
i
quickly
resolved
upon
you
recollect
madam
perchance
with
disdain
my
abrupt
departure
from
farmer
richardson
rejoiced
to
see
me
john
thomas
was
yet
brimful
of
miss
valmont
and
the
ghost
when
these
industrious
labourers
of
the
day
retired
to
early
rest
i
betook
myself
to
the
now
bleak
and
desolate
hermitage
no
sooner
had
i
deposited
my
lanthorn
and
little
basket
than
i
left
my
cell
intending
to
revisit
not
with
rapture
but
regret
her
selected
paths
it
was
i
think
one
of
the
finest
nights
i
ever
beheld
and
i
must
have
wanted
that
fervour
of
soul
which
gave
birth
to
my
love
had
i
not
been
enchanted
with
the
scene
the
resplendent
moon
now
at
the
summit
of
her
growth
silvered
the
wide
spreading
branches
of
sibella
oak
the
fairest
tree
of
the
forest
her
steady
beam
glittered
over
one
half
the
tomb
the
bending
bough
of
a
cypress
on
the
other
half
shed
irregular
darkness
the
rock
cast
its
pointed
shadow
up
the
light
and
shade
no
longer
blended
but
were
abruptly
contrasted
no
cloud
glided
into
motion
no
zephyr
into
sound
on
the
porch
i
leaned
imagination
was
alive
i
will
not
conceal
aught
from
you
miss
ashburn
an
excess
of
tenderness
even
produced
tears
and
why
need
i
be
ashamed
of
that
emotion
is
not
a
property
of
guilt
and
while
i
wept
i
made
a
vow
at
the
shrine
of
reason
to
abandon
my
mad
enterprise
to
quit
for
ever
and
ever
this
seductive
rock
alas
reason
and
resolution
were
instantaneously
torn
from
me
by
the
sweetest
sound
that
ever
stole
on
the
listening
ear
of
night
you
know
the
rest
enraptured
i
listened
to
her
effusions
unobserved
was
her
shadow
scrawled
with
my
pencil
that
inconsistent
address
sighed
to
her
sigh
and
was
more
delirious
than
ever
prudent
cool
and
considerate
she
came
no
more
i
enticed
her
fawn
into
the
utmost
degree
of
fondness
and
when
nina
returned
to
my
cell
from
the
caresses
of
sibella
she
brought
me
a
pleasure
which
the
universe
to
me
can
not
equal
it
must
require
all
your
faith
madam
to
believe
that
i
lived
thus
without
the
shadow
of
a
motive
beyond
sometimes
seeing
and
sometimes
hearing
her
in
the
strictest
sincerity
i
assure
you
i
had
no
other
although
i
loved
her
to
dotage
although
i
feel
an
internal
testimony
that
i
can
not
live
without
her
yet
was
she
and
is
to
this
moment
more
effectually
banished
from
my
wishes
by
her
contract
with
montgomery
than
she
could
have
been
by
age
disease
or
any
possible
deformity
circumstance
or
accident
might
inflict
the
sweetly
soothing
promise
of
speedy
dissolution
produced
temporary
vigour
it
enabled
me
to
quit
that
vague
and
idle
mode
of
life
unsatisfactory
to
myself
and
cruel
to
sibella
to
brave
the
censures
of
montgomery
to
ask
your
pity
and
finally
determined
me
to
retire
to
a
romantic
and
fit
retreat
for
sorrow
i
once
saw
on
the
banks
of
the
danube
one
absurdity
more
and
i
have
done
by
the
little
fawn
i
sent
my
farewel
to
your
friend
and
waited
only
for
darkness
to
revisit
farmer
richardson
night
came
and
with
it
rain
and
such
an
impervious
mist
that
i
could
not
see
my
hand
when
i
stretched
it
out
nor
was
i
so
lost
to
common
prudence
as
not
to
foresee
the
danger
of
attempting
my
descent
under
such
circumstance
morning
might
afford
me
opportunity
the
sword
i
brought
from
valmont
armoury
still
lay
on
the
floor
of
my
cell
and
a
temptation
arose
of
bearing
it
back
to
its
original
station
to
be
a
last
time
under
the
same
roof
with
sibella
to
offer
a
farewel
prayer
as
near
her
as
i
dared
things
so
apparently
unsatisfactory
of
themselves
as
these
acquire
an
infinity
of
importance
when
the
heart
is
assured
they
never
never
can
be
reacted
the
hour
of
night
made
me
bold
i
ventured
beyond
the
armoury
i
even
intended
seeking
the
room
you
once
spoke
of
and
stealing
from
it
her
portrait
my
beard
and
gown
gave
me
the
privilege
of
spirits
i
thought
to
walk
undisturbed
but
hardly
had
i
trodden
ten
paces
beyond
the
armoury
door
when
i
met
three
men
and
what
was
still
worse
considering
the
imagined
security
of
my
disguise
one
of
them
pursued
me
apprehension
gave
me
wings
i
flew
back
and
had
secured
the
pannel
before
he
entered
the
armoury
then
regained
my
cell
with
all
possible
expedition
this
accident
prevented
my
quitting
the
park
by
least
i
should
be
watched
on
the
next
morning
when
nina
came
panting
down
to
my
cell
i
heard
a
voice
calling
her
back
to
which
every
nerve
vibrated
throughout
my
frame
i
went
up
into
the
chapel
sibella
was
there
i
was
shocked
to
see
her
pale
and
she
heard
me
with
patience
she
looked
on
me
with
pity
above
all
she
gave
me
very
good
advice
in
the
dusk
of
that
evening
i
left
valmont
park
as
eager
now
to
quit
this
place
as
i
had
formerly
been
to
seek
it
i
would
not
even
allow
myself
to
rest
one
night
at
the
farm
but
although
the
evening
was
dark
and
chilling
i
mounted
my
horse
and
bade
richardson
farewel
my
strength
failed
me
my
head
became
dizzy
and
the
bridle
frequently
dropped
from
my
hand
when
i
reached
the
first
village
on
my
road
i
stopped
at
an
inn
and
ordered
a
chaise
to
be
got
ready
for
me
they
showed
me
into
a
room
where
three
or
four
other
persons
were
seated
at
a
table
drinking
i
drew
a
chair
close
to
the
fire
and
turned
my
face
from
them
for
a
minute
after
my
entrance
they
remained
silent
but
observing
i
imagine
that
i
did
not
appear
disposed
to
give
them
any
attention
they
resumed
their
conversation
and
little
should
i
have
known
of
their
subject
had
not
the
name
of
miss
valmont
struck
upon
my
ear
i
turned
round
involuntarily
and
found
the
speaker
was
a
dark
young
man
smartly
dressed
he
was
evidently
in
a
state
of
intoxication
and
his
auditors
not
more
sober
than
himself
were
the
landlord
of
the
inn
and
two
countrymen
i
was
to
tell
you
all
i
know
about
it
said
the
man
would
stare
sure
enough
and
it
is
all
true
as
the
gospel
it
is
my
friend
the
nobleman
i
told
you
of
knows
all
the
business
as
well
as
i
do
ay
ay
and
he
marry
her
too
such
a
devilish
fine
girl
deserves
a
lord
for
her
husband
this
speech
interlarded
with
many
oaths
had
also
frequent
interruptions
from
the
effects
of
his
inebriety
so
that
my
chaise
was
announced
just
as
he
spoke
the
last
word
i
sat
still
and
called
for
wine
they
again
recollected
the
presence
of
a
stranger
another
silence
ensued
and
while
i
lingered
over
my
wine
the
young
man
and
one
other
of
the
company
dropped
asleep
my
interest
in
that
name
would
not
suffer
me
to
depart
i
grew
restless
and
uneasy
i
shifted
my
chair
stirred
the
fire
and
in
so
doing
doubtless
roused
the
sleeper
for
he
started
up
and
vociferated
a
great
oath
see
it
added
he
i
saw
it
myself
with
my
own
eyes
the
lord
defend
us
no
wonder
no
wonder
i
would
sleep
in
old
valmont
skin
to
have
twenty
fine
castles
to
cheat
his
own
daughter
out
of
such
a
fine
fortune
is
enough
to
make
the
ghosts
of
all
her
grandfather
walk
out
of
their
graves
forty
thousand
is
the
least
well
well
said
he
rising
shall
see
the
day
yet
when
a
certain
lord
that
i
know
will
have
her
and
her
fifty
thousand
pounds
too
come
landlord
here
a
safe
deliverance
to
miss
valmont
and
her
money
out
of
the
claws
of
her
old
griping
uncle
having
swallowed
his
bumper
he
staggered
out
of
the
room
and
the
landlord
was
instantly
summoned
to
assist
him
to
bed
from
one
of
the
remaining
guests
i
learned
that
this
man
had
lately
come
from
london
but
his
name
was
unknown
to
them
finding
my
intelligence
at
an
end
i
stepped
into
my
chaise
and
proceeded
towards
barlowe
hall
during
my
journey
i
often
almost
indeed
perpetually
thought
of
the
conversation
i
had
heard
in
the
inn
and
when
i
had
arrived
at
barlowe
hall
and
sat
in
the
same
apartment
where
i
first
heard
you
speak
of
sibella
i
also
recollected
that
colonel
ridson
who
had
been
in
habits
of
intimacy
with
her
father
expressed
both
doubt
and
surprise
when
you
said
miss
valmont
was
dependent
on
her
uncle
this
recollection
added
new
force
to
the
assertions
of
the
young
man
in
the
village
i
became
persuaded
that
some
injury
was
intended
to
miss
valmont
and
resolved
if
possible
to
develop
the
mystery
i
journeyed
back
again
to
the
village
where
my
suspicions
had
first
been
excited
the
young
man
had
departed
the
day
before
and
no
one
could
tell
me
of
his
route
i
now
determined
to
put
it
in
sibella
own
power
to
demand
an
explanation
of
her
uncle
again
but
without
my
hermit
disguise
i
crossed
the
moat
and
ascended
the
rock
when
i
approached
her
in
the
wood
she
looked
on
me
sorrowfully
but
miss
ashburn
there
was
no
welcome
in
her
eye
i
had
neither
power
nor
inclination
to
hold
her
long
in
conversation
i
briefly
related
to
her
my
suspicions
and
as
i
told
you
before
she
bade
me
wait
her
return
in
the
cell
she
returned
no
more
have
i
then
seen
her
for
the
last
time
i
sicken
never
never
never
to
behold
her
oh
for
a
potion
powerful
in
its
nature
rapid
in
its
effect
that
would
overwhelm
these
dregs
of
existence
giving
me
but
time
to
know
the
relief
of
dying
when
life
has
become
hateful
in
continuation
the
carriage
in
which
i
instantly
return
to
barlowe
hall
stands
waiting
before
my
window
i
do
not
fly
through
fear
but
if
valmont
knows
my
secret
visits
and
punishes
her
for
my
faults
he
may
release
her
when
i
am
gone
write
to
me
i
beseech
you
miss
ashburn
and
say
why
sibella
suffers
she
is
a
prisoner
madam
she
has
quarrelled
with
her
uncle
it
is
said
he
struck
heaven
forbid
it
is
said
she
attempted
suicide
but
she
will
tell
you
all
and
for
pity
sake
relieve
my
suspence
though
you
can
not
quell
my
anxiety
respectfully
murden
my
authority
is
derived
from

not

any
person
but
the

letter
vii
from
lord
filmar
to
sir
walter
boyer
to
the
last
hour
i
have
lingered
here
sometimes
in
hope
sometimes
in
fear
still
bold
in
plan
but
irresolute
in
attempt
and
now
when
the
sun
of
my
success
begins
to
beam
upon
me
now
must
i
come
to
london
to
sign
deeds
to
my
shame
and
to
pay
money
for
my
folly
yet
walter
though
i
come
to
london
hither
i
mean
to
return
again
for
as
i
told
you
before
the
sun
of
my
success
begins
to
shine
know
dear
knight
that
things
are
all
we
are
in
great
alarm
great
inquietude
and
considerable
trepidation
but
as
you
may
not
be
perfectly
able
of
yourself
to
reconcile
these
assertions
be
patient
while
i
lend
you
my
assistance
yesterday
being
about
to
quit
the
country
i
thought
proper
to
pay
a
visit
of
duty
to
my
uncle
elect
my
footman
rode
up
and
sounded
the
bell
of
roar
said
the
shaggy
cerberus
on
the
other
side
of
the
moat
while
the
porter
crawling
out
of
his
den
bawled
out
for
our
business
lord
filmar
to
visit
valmont
answered
george
the
porter
walked
n
the
fellow
said
i
has
not
let
down
the
bridge
my
lord
replied
george
and
then
i
swore
again
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
something
less
the
porter
came
back
valmont
compliments
to
lord
filmar
and
he
is
engaged
now
walter
as
you
dote
on
discoveries
tell
me
what
does
your
algebraic
head
make
out
of
this
he
no
indeed
he
nor
that
neither
walter
now
i
discovered
it
in
an
instant
cool
and
penetrating
i
saw
at
once
that
valmont
did
not
choose
to
see
but
why
that
quite
another
matter
filmar
said
my
father
are
the
most
impertinent
prevaricating
puppy
i
ever
knew
in
my
life
lord
replied
i
bowing
modestly
am
told
i
have
the
honour
greatly
to
resemble
your
lordship
you
this
is
all
going
from
the
point
did
you
ever
beating
time
on
one
hand
with
a
letter
he
held
in
the
other
or
indirectly
talk
to
any
one
about
miss
valmont
sir
did
sir
fierce
attitude
pray
what
did
you
say
said
my
lord
that
miss
valmont
was
a
young
lady
well
lord
filmar
is
mighty
well
go
on
sir
ridicule
your
father
for
all
his
acts
of
kindness
to
you
my
lord
is
out
of
the
question
but
indeed
i
never
shall
be
serious
without
knowing
why
and
your
interrogatories
of
the
last
half
hour
are
so
vague
i
can
not
understand
them
you
ask
me
if
i
did
ever
talk
of
miss
valmont
as
a
young
man
naturally
talks
of
a
young
woman
so
may
i
have
talked
of
miss
valmont
the
other
day
for
instance
i
was
riding
with
miss
monckton
should
like
of
all
said
she
see
the
wild
girl
of
the
twice
i
have
visited
there
with
my
mother
but
valmont
wo
suffer
her
to
be
earl
replied
i
she
is
handsome
and
i
too
should
be
charmed
to
see
perhaps
my
lord
i
may
have
made
a
score
such
speeches
and
if
they
are
any
thing
to
the
purpose
i
will
endeavour
to
recollect
them
in
form
and
let
me
see
last
friday
cried
the
earl
are
nothing
to
my
purpose
then
will
you
be
pleased
my
lord
to
tell
me
what
is
a
pause
succeeded
during
which
he
appeared
to
seek
instruction
from
the
contents
of
the
letter
in
his
hand
there
is
any
thing
in
that
letter
my
lord
said
i
stretching
out
my
hand
to
receive
it
relates
to
me
suffer
me
to
read
it
then
i
can
answer
straight
forward
to
the
charge
it
was
not
enough
simply
to
refuse
the
earl
crammed
the
letter
into
his
pocket
hem
said
the
earl
we
came
to
sir
gilbert
i
remember
lord
filmar
you
thought
fit
to
wind
and
pry
into
the
state
of
miss
valmont
fortune
now
if
you
took
upon
you
to
assert
any
thing
to
any
one
from
that
conversation
remember
you
told
a
falsehood
sir
an
absolute
she
has
no
fortune
whatever
sir
not
a
penny
fortune
whatever
sir
not
a
penny
repeated
i
slowly
and
fixing
my
eyes
on
his
he
had
the
grace
almost
to
that
as
it
may
i
never
told
any
falsehoods
in
consequence
of
that
conversation
my
i
might
have
said
if
i
had
thought
proper
that
you
deemed
or
a
year
a
suitable
portion
for
me
and
meant
to
propose
me
to
miss
valmont
sir
if
you
mean
to
put
your
own
construction
on
every
unguarded
disjointed
expression
a
man
drops
in
conversation
you
may
make
something
out
of
nothing
at
any
time
sir
the
discourse
was
disjointed
and
unguarded
enough
but
the
design
was
i
believe
perfectly
i
am
sorry
truly
sorry
the
plan
has
your
lordship
any
further
commands
for
me
said
i
rising
are
piqued
my
lord
replied
my
father
drawing
the
letter
out
of
his
have
cause
enough
to
be
irritated
i
am
sure
my
character
as
a
gentleman
is
at
stake
valmont
here
makes
charges
against
me
which
i
do
quite
understand
i
held
out
my
hand
again
for
the
letter
and
he
again
drew
it
away
my
lord
said
i
perhaps
you
would
rather
read
it
to
me
the
best
information
and
advice
in
my
power
is
altogether
at
your
lordship
devotion
and
if
it
is
secresy
you
require
i
am
dumb
as
the
grave
the
earl
looked
somewhat
doubtful
at
length
he
suffered
me
to
take
the
letter
now
walter
read
this
letter
with
attention
to
the
earl
of
elsings
my
lord
as
i
took
you
to
be
a
man
of
honour
i
fully
relied
on
your
word
and
never
for
an
instant
supposed
you
could
depart
from
the
strict
performance
of
the
promise
you
gave
with
so
much
readiness
and
solemnity
of
concealing
from
all
the
world
the
real
situation
of
miss
valmont
circumstances
till
the
time
when
i
her
uncle
guardian
and
her
only
surviving
relation
should
no
longer
deem
such
a
concealment
necessary
you
knew
my
lord
i
could
have
no
sinister
design
in
teaching
miss
valmont
to
believe
herself
dependent
upon
me
my
integrity
forbids
the
possibility
of
such
a
surmise
and
my
lord
at
once
in
compliance
alone
with
my
own
opinion
of
its
propriety
did
i
resign
to
you
the
entire
care
of
her
estate
reserving
to
myself
the
guardianship
of
her
person
and
the
direction
of
her
education
to
which
cares
the
brother
of
her
father
had
the
most
undoubted
claim
to
the
period
when
miss
valmont
should
have
attained
the
age
of
twenty
i
limited
your
secresy
my
lord
and
this
adds
another
proof
if
another
could
be
necessary
to
the
goodness
of
my
intentions
by
her
father
will
she
becomes
independent
of
her
guardians
at
at
twenty
i
intended
that
herself
and
her
possessions
should
be
given
to
the
husband
for
whom
i
have
purposely
educated
her
and
from
whom
for
the
security
of
their
future
happiness
i
would
carefully
have
hidden
the
knowledge
of
her
fortune
till
that
period
my
precautions
were
taken
with
such
order
and
contrivance
that
i
have
reason
to
believe
it
has
not
even
been
suspected
by
any
creature
that
miss
valmont
is
an
heiress
not
slumber
dear
walter
read
that
line
again
miss
valmont
is
an
yet
now
my
lord
my
niece
herself
is
apprized
of
it
and
has
with
more
zeal
than
either
judgment
or
duty
demanded
an
explanation
of
my
motives
for
treating
her
as
my
dependent
it
is
you
only
who
can
have
conveyed
this
intelligence
to
her
you
my
lord
who
i
am
sorry
to
say
since
you
formed
the
design
of
uniting
miss
valmont
to
your
son
have
forgotten
honour
and
integrity
i
believe
your
son
has
found
entrance
into
my
castle
by
means
a
gentleman
should
scorn
to
use
but
neither
in
his
own
nor
in
his
feigned
name
shall
he
gain
another
admission
my
vigilance
is
awakened
and
in
his
behalf
it
shall
not
slumber
a
second
time
my
lord
i
have
returned
the
accounts
you
sent
for
my
inspection
together
with
the
necessary
acquittals
and
i
request
we
may
not
meet
any
more
as
the
business
till
miss
valmont
is
of
age
may
be
transacted
by
any
agent
you
choose
to
appoint
i
remain
my
lord
henceforth
a
stranger
to
you
and
george
valmont
there
not
said
i
and
in
truth
walter
i
did
not
very
well
know
what
to
say
so
dizzy
had
i
become
in
reading
incontrovertible
acknowledgement
of
his
niece
fortune
together
with
the
unlooked
for
charge
against
me
of
having
stolen
into
his
castle
there
not
said
i
like
a
challenge
implied
here
my
lord
indeed
replied
my
father
with
sufficient
eagerness
you
see
he
desires
we
may
not
meet
but
i
am
rather
in
doubt
filmar
whether
we
ought
or
ought
not
to
send
valmont
a
challenge
am
i
my
lord
but
if
your
will
allow
me
an
hour
to
consider
the
case
i
will
settle
it
if
possible
do
said
the
earl
what
can
he
mean
about
you
and
the
castle
one
sir
but
himself
can
decide
that
matter
i
believe
the
problem
i
had
now
to
solve
consisted
walter
of
three
parts
first
how
miss
valmont
could
have
arrived
at
the
knowledge
of
her
fortune
secondly
how
valmont
could
know
i
had
been
in
the
castle
lastly
and
of
most
importance
whether
all
circumstances
duly
considered
it
would
be
proper
that
i
or
my
father
should
challenge
valmont
my
researches
on
the
first
part
of
my
problem
showed
me
that
it
is
highly
probable
i
shall
never
know
how
miss
valmont
came
by
her
information
till
she
herself
shall
be
in
my
power
to
tell
me
and
further
that
her
knowledge
of
the
affair
will
greatly
tend
to
forward
my
projects
for
no
longer
a
dependent
but
a
prisoner
she
will
be
rejoiced
to
free
herself
at
any
hazard
from
her
uncle
galling
do
you
not
perceive
walter
how
much
my
prospects
are
amended
by
this
disaster
on
the
second
part
i
discovered
that
valmont
can
have
but
an
obscure
and
imperfect
idea
of
my
being
in
the
castle
from
his
mention
of
a
feigned
name
i
bore
no
name
at
all
certainly
my
agents
would
not
betray
me
and
valmont
must
have
spoken
at
random
as
to
the
means
out
of
the
foregone
conclusions
arises
the
answer
to
the
third
part
of
my
problems
it
would
be
highly
improper
for
either
me
or
my
father
to
challenge
valmont
what
a
blessing
it
is
sir
knight
to
find
sympathy
in
our
griefs
from
the
moment
my
father
confided
to
me
this
important
business
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
its
nature
and
my
apparent
concern
he
was
lighter
than
and
valiant
too
talked
big
and
bluff
about
honour
and
satisfaction
and
could
but
just
be
prevailed
on
by
my
intreaties
only
to
write
the
following
pacific
answer
in
which
were
he
not
a
gentleman
the
earl
of
elsings
and
my
honoured
father
you
or
i
might
be
bold
enough
to
say
he
tells
absolute
to
george
valmont
esq
sir
the
charge
you
are
pleased
to
make
against
me
reflects
infinitely
more
disgrace
on
yourself
by
its
injustice
than
on
me
such
an
imputation
deserves
nothing
but
scorn
yet
i
will
answer
it
so
far
as
to
say
that
neither
my
son
nor
any
person
breathing
has
received
from
me
the
smallest
intimation
of
miss
valmont
fortune
my
son
never
was
in
valmont
castle
under
any
other
name
than
that
of
lord
filmar
where
his
behaviour
kept
pace
with
the
dignity
of
his
name
which
will
never
suffer
him
to
intrude
himself
or
his
alliance
where
it
will
not
be
rather
courted
than
accepted
i
am
quite
as
desirous
as
you
sir
can
be
of
dropping
the
acquaintance
and
till
the
time
you
mention
i
shall
as
i
have
ever
done
sacredly
guard
my
trust
wishing
you
may
do
the
same
i
remain
sir
your
humble
servant
elsings
didst
thou
never
dear
walter
see
two
curs
pop
unexpectedly
on
one
another
within
a
yard
and
half
of
a
bone
says
one
softly
setting
down
his
lifted
fore
replies
and
each
clapping
his
cowardly
tail
between
his
legs
slinks
backward
a
little
way
then
ventures
to
turn
round
and
scampers
off
like
a
if
thou
has
wit
to
find
the
moral
thou
mayst
also
apply
as
for
me
having
reached
the
top
round
of
my
information
i
beg
leave
to
resign
you
to
your
cogitations
and
am
as
i
am
filmar
she
is
a
girl
of
spirit
and
on
my
soul
is
infamous
she
should
be
thus
treated
had
the
earl
a
grain
of
kindness
he
would
rescue
her
but
no
he
asserts
he
can
not
possibly
think
of
interfering
in
two
years
she
will
be
of
age
and
then
if
she
should
demand
his
protection
it
will
be
a
different
ah
but
i
wo
say
you
are
to
know
boyer
that
griffiths
has
accidentally
met
his
dear
friend
the
butler
it
was
she
herself
spoke
to
her
uncle
of
having
seen
a
stranger
and
what
she
further
told
him
which
the
butler
does
not
know
irritated
him
to
strike
instantly
she
rushed
from
his
presence
into
the
park
but
finding
herself
pursued
changed
her
direction
which
was
toward
her
favourite
wood
and
flew
to
the
other
side
of
the
park
where
the
wall
not
being
very
perfect
she
climbed
it
rapidly
and
in
sight
of
her
pursuers
threw
herself
headlong
into
the
moat
she
was
taken
up
unhurt
and
is
locked
within
her
own
apartments
either
from
disappointment
terror
or
real
indisposition
she
confines
herself
to
her
bed
and
preserves
a
perfect
silence
whenever
andrew
or
her
female
domestic
approaches
valmont
has
not
seen
her
since
the
prevaricating
confusion
of
some
of
the
servants
made
valmont
suspect
them
of
being
bribed
to
admit
a
stranger
but
the
butler
being
positive
no
one
living
soul
more
than
he
knows
has
been
within
the
walls
he
and
others
think
miss
valmont
has
seen
the
spirit
again
and
is
disordered
in
her
intellects
i
am
completely
that
hermit
miss
monckton
has
seen
montgomery
and
calls
him
a
fine
elegant
fellow
who
makes
love
to
every
pretty
woman
he
meets
if
that
his
forte
he
would
scarcely
be
content
to
creep
like
a
snail
out
of
his
shell
for
a
few
stolen
moments
at
but
what
has
set
me
to
doubt
and
conjecture
is
that
griffiths
has
heard
of
a
very
handsome
man
who
lodges
at
a
farm
hard
by
and
wanders
about
the
country
night
and
day
the
people
say
it
is
a
pity
such
a
sweet
gentleman
should
go
mad
for
love
yet
is
it
possible
any
one
should
know
so
well
how
to
enter
and
escape
but
those
who
had
lived
in
the
secrets
of
the
castle
psha
in
ten
hours
after
you
receive
this
letter
i
hope
to
sup
in
your
new
lodgings
letter
viii
from
george
valmont
to
clement
montgomery
what
does
this
mean
clement
montgomery
sibella
talks
of
a
marriage
with
have
you
dared
sir
to
form
a
marriage
without
my
concurrence
i
should
dispute
the
possibility
but
i
find
from
the
avarice
and
ignorance
of
the
wretches
in
my
household
people
have
been
admitted
for
one
purpose
and
perhaps
others
may
have
been
admitted
for
another
purpose
i
command
you
instantly
to
tell
me
how
far
you
have
proceeded
sir
against
the
obedience
due
to
valmont
letter
ix
from
clement
montgomery
to
george
valmont
dear
sir
an
attempt
would
be
vain
to
express
my
astonishment
at
the
contents
of
your
last
favour
or
my
concern
at
your
supposing
me
guilty
of
so
flagrant
a
commission
of
ingratitude
to
him
who
has
been
my
more
than
father
miss
valmont
mode
of
expression
is
strong
and
vehement
she
may
call
the
early
union
of
our
affections
a
marriage
for
know
of
none
no
sir
however
my
wishes
might
urge
me
forward
however
painful
the
struggle
might
be
and
was
betwixt
my
love
of
her
and
my
duty
to
you
i
sacrificed
my
hopes
in
my
obedience
i
flatter
myself
you
will
rely
on
this
assurance
and
consider
the
assertions
of
your
lovely
niece
as
romantic
as
they
really
are
my
time
sir
had
not
probably
been
spent
to
as
much
advantage
as
it
might
have
been
but
i
dare
venture
to
pronounce
it
not
totally
thrown
away
it
is
true
i
have
not
yet
attached
myself
to
any
particular
profession
although
you
may
expect
i
should
tell
you
of
my
progress
therein
but
without
a
guide
or
director
i
feared
rashly
to
engage
lest
i
should
afterwards
discover
my
abilities
unfitted
to
the
part
i
had
chosen
a
general
knowledge
of
the
nature
and
professors
of
each
previously
gained
according
to
your
advice
i
deemed
might
hereafter
save
me
the
time
at
present
expended
thus
have
i
been
employed
sir
and
thus
i
plead
my
excuse
for
not
having
written
to
you
sooner
may
i
not
presume
to
expect
a
continuance
of
your
favours
whilst
i
continue
to
deserve
them
i
beg
my
dutiful
respects
to
valmont
and
as
i
hope
i
may
offer
my
best
wishes
to
sibella
to
you
sir
i
shall
ever
remain
the
most
grateful
and
respectful
of
your
servants

montgomery
letter
x
from
caroline
ashburn
to
arthur
murden
yes
rash
and
inconsiderate
young
man
i
do
accept
your
confidence
your
offered
friendship
but
remember
i
can
not
profess
myself
the
friend
of
any
one
to
gloss
over
follies
or
vices
a
friend
not
blindly
partial
but
active
to
amend
you
is
the
friend
you
must
at
once
receive
or
at
once
reject
in
me
i
have
heard
myself
called
pedantic
inflexible
opinionated
i
have
been
told
by
some
gentler
people
that
i
am
severe
misjudging
giving
to
those
little
foibles
almost
inseparable
from
human
nature
the
name
of
vice
and
this
may
be
true
for
you
call
yourself
a
foolish
man
i
call
you
nay
start
not
murden
but
lay
your
hand
on
your
heart
and
tell
me
if
you
have
well
employed
your
time
and
talents
if
you
have
done
service
to
human
kind
or
if
you
have
not
in
fraud
and
secresy
bubbled
away
your
happiness
and
if
it
is
the
part
of
a
virtuous
man
to
sigh
with
black
misanthropy
in
solitude
a
few
passive
years
and
then
lie
down
in
the
grave
unblessing
and
unblessed
yet
i
do
pity
you
for
i
have
neither
a
hard
nor
a
cold
heart
nor
a
heart
that
dare
receive
a
sensation
it
will
not
for
your
example
dare
to
yes
i
confess
i
have
loved
you
yet
because
i
could
not
possess
myself
of
the
strong
holds
in
your
heart
shall
i
sink
down
and
die
no
no
i
bade
the
vague
hope
i
refused
to
be
the
worst
of
slaves
the
slave
of
self
and
now
my
friend
more
worthy
than
ever
of
your
friendship
i
am
ready
to
do
any
thing
in
your
behalf
that
reason
can
approve
that
service
is
to
gain
sibella
for
you
again
you
your
false
delicacy
and
false
refinement
fly
to
guard
you
with
their
sevenfold
shield
from
the
but
hear
me
murden
i
would
not
unite
you
as
you
are
to
the
sibella
valmont
whom
you
have
loved
with
all
the
fervour
the
most
impassioned
language
can
describe
the
erring
sibella
while
she
sees
neither
spot
nor
stain
in
him
with
whom
she
has
pledged
herself
in
union
no
i
would
first
subdue
the
fermentation
of
your
senses
teach
you
to
esteem
sibella
worth
pity
her
errors
and
love
her
with
infinite
sincerity
but
not
so
as
to
absorb
your
active
virtues
to
transform
you
from
a
man
into
a
you
are
but
two
beings
in
the
great
brotherhood
of
mankind
and
what
right
have
you
to
separate
your
benevolence
from
your
and
make
a
world
between
you
when
you
can
not
separate
your
wants
also
you
must
be
dependent
for
your
blessings
on
the
great
mass
of
mankind
as
they
in
part
also
depend
on
when
you
can
thus
love
i
would
unite
you
to
sibella
who
in
turn
shall
be
roused
from
the
present
mistaken
zeal
of
her
affections
her
soul
will
renounce
the
union
her
mistakes
have
formed
when
she
knows
clement
as
unworthy
of
her
as
he
really
is
from
a
struggle
perhaps
worse
than
death
she
will
rise
dignified
into
superior
happiness
claim
you
as
her
friend
her
monitor
her
guide
and
devote
her
life
her
love
to
your
virtues
o
yes
i
know
it
well
your
imagination
teems
with
the
rhapsodies
of
passion
i
hear
your
declamation
the
dictates
of
a
fevered
fancy
i
do
pity
you
murden
from
my
soul
and
if
i
did
not
believe
you
able
to
overcome
all
the
misery
you
deplore
i
should
not
pity
you
at
all
i
can
scarcely
picture
to
myself
a
life
more
negative
less
energetic
notwithstanding
your
fervor
than
that
you
would
have
led
with
sibella
had
fortune
placed
you
in
the
situation
clement
stood
with
her
do
not
let
your
burning
brain
consume
you
at
the
supposition
for
highly
gifted
as
you
both
are
mind
can
not
always
feel
in
that
extreme
the
tight
drawn
wire
must
either
snap
or
too
happy
banished
in
rapture
age
would
have
come
upon
you
without
preparation
for
its
arrival
without
proper
nourishment
for
its
abode
in
vain
you
then
turn
to
each
other
for
the
spell
that
guarded
you
from
every
intruding
care
is
broken
and
you
have
lessons
wearisome
tasks
to
learn
which
would
only
have
been
pleasant
relaxations
intermixed
with
the
abounding
delights
of
youth
you
are
both
at
present
the
victims
of
erroneous
educations
but
your
artificial
refinements
being
so
admirably
checked
in
their
growth
now
i
know
not
two
people
upon
earth
so
calculated
so
fitted
for
each
other
as
murden
and
my
resolution
envigorates
with
the
prospect
be
ye
but
what
ye
may
and
the
first
vaunted
pair
of
paradise
were
not
more
happy
i
perceive
not
only
the
value
of
the
work
i
undertake
but
the
labour
also
nor
am
i
deterred
by
the
firmness
wherewith
you
hold
your
resolutions
not
by
the
tedious
scarcely
perceptible
degrees
with
which
i
must
sap
the
foundation
of
sibella
ah
murden
i
suspect
had
she
possessed
equal
advantages
with
yourself
she
would
have
soared
far
beyond
what
you
are
as
yet
by
her
last
letter
i
find
she
discovers
a
deficiency
in
conduct
which
she
struggles
to
hide
from
her
own
he
is
my
best
auxiliary
i
once
thought
him
only
a
negative
character
drawn
this
way
or
that
by
a
thread
now
i
see
he
has
an
incessant
restlessness
after
pomp
and
pleasure
which
nothing
can
subdue
and
to
which
every
thing
must
yield
sibella
in
her
turn
indeed
half
her
hold
at
least
is
gone
if
he
speaks
of
her
now
to
me
she
is
not
as
before
his
adored
an
angel
superior
to
every
thing
in
heaven
or
on
earth
but
one
lady
has
an
eye
almost
as
intelligent
as
sibella
another
a
bloom
of
complexion
scarcely
less
exquisite
and
a
third
in
form
in
graces
moves
a
counterpart
goddess
as
you
say
there
is
a
vehemency
and
energy
in
his
expressions
that
in
the
general
apprehension
cloathe
him
with
attributes
which
never
did
and
never
can
belong
to
him
it
is
but
very
rarely
that
i
partake
of
his
effusions
for
i
am
not
to
his
taste
my
mother
is
his
confidante
and
she
is
quite
fascinated
with
the
descriptions
of
his
love
when
he
was
first
introduced
to
us
i
thought
it
necessary
for
a
reason
you
perhaps
divine
to
mention
the
mutual
attachment
subsisting
between
clement
and
mrs
ashburn
declared
she
would
take
his
constancy
under
her
protection
yes
she
would
guard
him
from
folly
and
temptation
alas
murden
i
am
sick
of
the
scenes
that
surround
me
formerly
we
were
moderate
and
retired
to
what
we
are
now
our
house
is
the
palace
of
luxury
every
varying
effort
of
novelty
is
exerted
to
fill
the
vacant
mind
with
pleasure
useless
are
my
remonstrances
eastern
magnificence
and
eastern
voluptuousness
here
hold
their
court
and
my
mother
borrowing
from
her
splendor
every
other
pretension
to
charm
plunges
deeper
and
deeper
in
the
vortex
of
vanity
fain
would
i
leave
it
all
but
i
dare
not
proscribe
my
little
power
of
doing
come
then
my
friends
you
who
have
already
taken
your
station
in
my
heart
murden
and
sibella
live
for
each
other
live
that
i
may
sometimes
quit
the
drudgery
of
dissipation
to
participate
of
happiness
with
you
if
it
really
was
valmont
design
which
i
very
much
doubt
to
give
clement
up
to
a
profession
nothing
could
be
more
unfortunate
than
his
introduction
here
where
with
his
natural
inclination
to
do
the
same
he
sees
wealth
lavished
without
check
or
restraint
so
highly
does
he
stand
in
my
mother
opinion
for
taste
and
so
animated
are
his
bursts
of
applause
that
no
overstrained
variety
is
received
or
rejected
without
his
to
be
the
confidante
of
a
heart
is
a
novelty
with
ashburn
who
has
had
little
concern
in
affairs
of
the
heart
and
perhaps
to
preserve
him
from
sacrificing
in
her
presence
to
the
vanity
of
others
may
be
her
motive
for
encouraging
him
to
speak
of
his
passion
for
i
have
watched
him
narrowly
and
if
he
has
any
lurking
wishes
here
i
am
persuaded
they
fix
on
mademoiselle
laundy
i
believe
you
never
saw
this
companion
of
ashburn
she
or
i
greatly
mistake
has
of
all
persons
i
know
most
command
over
herself
i
had
almost
forgotten
to
tell
you
that
clement
read
me
a
few
concluding
lines
of
your
last
letter
to
him
what
a
decided
melancholy
have
you
displayed
therein
no
my
dear
friend
you
must
not
shall
not
clement
was
considerably
affected
by
the
representation
of
your
feelings
yet
he
said
you
had
used
him
ill
in
the
foregoing
part
and
he
believed
he
should
never
write
to
you
i
find
he
has
no
suspicions
of
you
and
i
leave
you
to
tell
him
at
your
own
time
and
in
your
own
way
still
i
say
nothing
of
sibella
present
distress
you
cry
i
have
had
no
information
of
it
except
from
yourself
i
have
written
again
to
sibella
and
look
for
an
answer
daily
with
respect
to
her
fortune
i
think
it
probable
that
she
should
be
her
father
heir
but
of
that
we
can
judge
better
when
we
hear
what
her
uncle
says
to
the
charge
alas
i
know
valmont
is
vindictive
proud
and
impatient
of
she
resolute
daring
to
do
aught
she
dare
he
might
strike
as
to
suicide
i
know
her
better
it
would
be
as
remote
from
her
thoughts
under
any
suffering
as
light
from
darkness
oh
murden
she
is
indeed
a
glorious
girl
valmont
promised
me
an
unrestrained
correspondence
with
sibella
and
while
he
is
satisfied
in
the
exercise
of
his
own
power
over
her
person
he
will
as
usual
suffer
her
to
communicate
to
me
the
crowd
of
welcome
and
unwelcome
strangers
passing
to
and
fro
in
her
mind
i
need
scarcely
assure
you
that
whatever
intelligence
i
receive
you
shall
share
the
remain
at
barlowe
hall
for
though
your
uncle
is
very
desirous
that
you
should
come
to
london
i
am
certain
in
your
present
frame
of
mind
you
would
find
yourself
still
more
removed
from
ease
in
the
society
which
sir
thomas
would
provide
for
you
than
in
i
should
be
sorry
to
depend
for
my
happiness
on
that
heart
which
could
invite
pleasure
and
gaiety
to
quell
those
griefs
it
could
not
banish
by
reason
and
reflection
nor
have
i
murden
so
supreme
an
idea
of
your
prudence
as
not
to
foresee
the
birth
of
a
new
folly
should
montgomery
and
you
meet
each
other
farewel
and
may
the
blessing
you
bestowed
on
me
rest
also
with
yourself

it
was
no

filmar
letter
xiv
from
janetta
laundy
to
lord
filmar
my
lord
i
did
suppose
on
the
receipt
of
your
first
letter
that
you
alluded
to
my
calling
one
evening
on
montgomery
and
had
i
not
been
withheld
by
the
unwillingness
i
felt
to
disclose
the
secrets
of
another
person
i
should
certainly
then
have
acknowledged
that
i
paid
a
visit
to
montgomery
but
my
lord
you
compel
me
notwithstanding
my
extreme
reluctance
to
make
this
confession
at
the
same
time
i
must
to
prevent
your
surmises
injurious
to
myself
own
to
you
that
i
called
on
montgomery
the
evening
you
named
by
the
order
of
ashburn
whose
very
particular
friend
he
is
the
commission
my
lord
respected
some
business
of
a
private
nature
therefore
you
will
perceive
how
necessary
it
is
that
you
should
keep
secret
your
knowledge
of
this
transaction
there
is
scarce
any
thing
which
ashburn
would
not
sooner
pardon
in
me
than
this
breach
of
confidence
with
respect
to
my
introducing
you
my
lord
to
montgomery
a
moment
consideration
will
convince
you
of
its
impropriety
in
the
unhappy
and
dependent
situation
which
the
misfortunes
heaped
upon
my
family
have
compelled
me
to
seek
it
is
not
the
least
of
its
afflicting
circumstances
that
i
am
obliged
to
shape
all
my
actions
to
the
will
or
opinions
of
those
by
whom
i
am
surrounded
that
i
should
so
suddenly
claim
an
intimacy
with
a
person
of
lord
filmar
youth
graces
and
accomplishments
might
appear
suspicious
to
ashburn
beside
my
lord
how
do
you
suppose
i
am
to
conduct
myself
in
your
presence
for
although
you
may
have
forgotten
the
time
when
you
could
not
approach
me
without
trembling
i
can
neither
cease
to
remember
nor
cease
to
feel
it
is
not
possible
for
me
to
divine
why
you
should
insist
so
vehemently
on
my
bringing
you
acquainted
with
montgomery
nor
is
it
easy
to
decline
any
request
however
hazardous
the
grant
when
it
is
urged
by
one
who
has
such
claims
although
now
neglected
as
you
have
my
lord
on
me
i
have
studied
in
what
way
with
any
probability
of
safety
to
myself
i
can
gratify
your
wish
and
find
no
other
than
your
renewing
your
acquaintance
with
the
dutchess
de
n
who
is
also
at
this
time
in
london

there
frequently
i
think
my
lord
i
need
hardly
remind
you
of
the
caution
you
ought
to
use
if
by
any
accident
it
appears
that
we
are
acquainted
montgomery
was
in
paris
a
short
time
after
you
left
it
he
was
like
you
intimate
with
my
father
but
he
did
not
gain
the
devoted
heart
of
the
daughter
to
wound
my
reputation
now
would
be
barbarity
were
you
by
any
hint
or
jest
to
create
a
surmise
in
the
breast
of
montgomery
it
would
instantly
be
conveyed
by
him
to
ashburn
and
my
ruin
would
be
certain
i
intreat
you
will
think
of
this
with
attention
and
you
would
be
well
convinced
of
the
attention
it
demands
could
you
know
how
scrupulously
observant
ashburn
is
of
my
conduct
janetta
laundy
letter
xv
from
lord
filmar
to
janetta
laundy
female
friendship
still
so
constant
what
if
french
folks
did
surmise
and
say
strange
things
of
janetta
laundy
and
the
duke
de
n
the
dutchess
well
understands
the
value
of
a
certain
old
proverb
my
secret
and
i
keep
amiable
pair
fear
me
not
janetta
filmar
will
not
breathe
a
whisper
that
shall
disturb
thy
peace
for
he
perfectly
understands
that
montgomery
was
in
paris
after
him
last
night
i
supped
with
the
dutchess
montgomery
was
there
no
wonder
ashburn
is
of
your
janetta
for
she
glared
upon
us
last
night
in
the
fullness
of
her
blaze
and
i
perceived
in
half
an
hour
or
less
that
she
is
tremblingly
alive
to
every
species
of
decorum
whenever
this
lady
again
chooses
to
her
pretty
ambassadress
on
to
he
will
still
i
doubt
not
continue
to
receive
her
with
all
the
respect
due
to
her
do
not
be
angry
janetta
but
encourage
the
dimpling
smile
that
so
well
becomes
you
montgomery
dines
with
me
and
i
am
with
him
to
have
the
felicity
of
basking
in
the
sunshine
of
bright
eyes
at
route
this
evening
filmar
letter
xvi
from
caroline
ashburn
to
arthur
murden
how
strange
an
animal
is
man
how
prone
to
fall
into
habits
and
how
difficult
it
is
to
prescribe
bounds
to
the
growth
of
absurdity
i
did
not
imagine
valmont
would
extend
his
absurdities
so
much
on
the
sudden
nor
do
i
know
how
far
you
will
be
inclined
to
follow
his
example
when
i
tell
you
that
sibella
is
so
really
a
prisoner
even
my
letters
are
denied
access
to
her
yesterday
i
was
honoured
with
a
packet
from
valmont
containing
my
two
last
letters
to
sibella
one
written
in
answer
to
her
previous
to
the
receipt
of
your
and
the
other
written
in
consequence
of
the
information
you
gave
me
of
her
confinement
valmont
in
his
way
treats
me
with
unusual
respect
and
i
can
only
account
for
it
by
supposing
he
was
pleased
with
the
freedom
i
used
when
at
valmont
castle
in
speaking
to
him
of
his
very
improper
seclusion
of
sibella
my
letters
were
returned
unopened
and
with
them
the
following
madam
as
long
as
my
niece
deserved
the
indulgence
of
your
correspondence
i
though
against
the
principle
upon
which
i
formed
her
education
continued
to
allow
it
i
herewith
return
your
last
letters
i
would
not
open
them
because
i
believe
you
to
be
incapable
of
abetting
sibella
in
the
atrocity
of
her
conduct
but
i
shall
hold
myself
justified
therein
if
you
send
any
more
letters
after
you
receive
this
interdiction
truly
sorry
am
i
to
say
that
miss
valmont
proves
herself
unworthy
of
the
long
illustrious
line
from
whom
she
claims
her
name
and
of
whom
she
is
almost
the
only
surviving
descendant
unfortunate
that
house
whose
dignity
is
left
to
be
supported
by
a
female
whether
in
solitude
or
society
i
find
the
female
mind
still
a
mere
compound
of
folly
and
mischief
greatly
do
i
now
regret
i
ever
undertook
its
guardianship
i
have
the
honour
to
be
madam
your
humble
servant
valmont
valmont
scorns
to
flatter
would
you
have
been
so
candid
with
respect
to
the
female
mind
though
once
perhaps
you
enrolled
yourself
among
those
who
endeavour
strictly
to
check
the
growth
of
every
seed
therein
except
mischief
and
folly
my
patience
exhausts
itself
when
i
see
men
of
even
tolerable
talents
aiding
to
sink
lower
than
the
brute
in
value
the
fairest
of
god
a
horse
oh
a
laborious
horse
deserves
to
be
canonized
in
preference
to
the
woman
whose
sole
industry
consists
in
the
active
destruction
of
her
understanding
who
smiles
moves
and
speaks
as
it
were
only
to
prove
herself
unlike
every
production
of
wisdom
and
nature
the
principle
which
moves
this
mischief
is
the
error
males
and
females
partake
concerning
bid
them
form
a
woman
of
an
enlightened
understanding
and
with
the
learning
of
a
scholar
they
never
fail
to
associate
the
manners
of
a
talk
of
one
who
scorns
to
sink
in
apprehensions
who
would
rather
protect
herself
than
sacrifice
herself
who
can
stand
unpropped
in
the
creation
they
expect
a
giant
in
step
and
a
monster
in
if
reason
and
coarseness
were
thus
inseparable
it
were
better
to
take
both
than
to
abandon
both
but
it
is
the
reverse
wherever
coarseness
exists
with
talent
it
is
because
the
talent
is
contracted
let
it
expand
and
the
dignified
grace
and
softness
of
active
virtue
takes
its
more
of
this
hereafter
i
wish
rather
to
reason
than
declaim
and
i
have
at
present
a
heat
of
feeling
that
effectually
precludes
investigation
for
the
ebulitions
of
resentment
doubtless
you
have
already
exclaimed
against
my
seeming
unconcern
for
sibella
you
who
can
not
detach
yourself
a
moment
from
the
concerns
of
your
heart
can
you
forgive
such
a
lapse
in
another
of
what
avail
in
our
present
darkness
to
canvass
it
for
an
age
i
must
do
something
more
morning
i
set
out
for
valmont
castle
and
if
at
my
desire
you
keep
your
station
you
may
depend
on
the
speediest
information
from
your
sincere
friend
caroline
ashburn
letter
xvii
from
lord
filmar
to
sir
walter
boyer
a
pleasant
journey
be
thine
walter
but
if
this
sudden
trip
be
meant
to
evade
the
consequences
of
my
wrath
it
was
unnecessary
truly
i
forgave
you
on
the
spot
in
consequence
of
the
very
ridiculous
situation
you
were
in
turning
with
beseeching
looks
to
me
for
pardon
and
stammering
contradiction
after
contradiction
to
montgomery
which
served
only
to
confirm
the
suspicions
in
his
mind
your
foolish
audible
whisper
had
occasioned
how
guarded
have
i
always
been
when
montgomery
spoke
of
the
valmonts
and
little
did
i
suppose
though
i
knew
your
talent
when
i
urged
him
to
show
you
the
picture
you
could
forget
your
caution
your
shrug
your
leer
your
whisper
struck
montgomery
dumb
and
to
my
explanation
he
appeared
no
less
deaf
yesterday
he
did
not
keep
his
appointment
with
we
accidentally
met
in
the
evening
where
it
had
been
better
we
had
neither
been
but
he
was
distant
and
embarrassed
scarcely
had
griffiths
begun
the
honours
of
my
head
this
morning
than
montgomery
was
announced
and
condescended
to
amuse
himself
with
rosetta
and
ponto
in
the
till
the
business
of
my
sitting
was
at
an
end
by
heaven
he
cried
as
i
entered
the
room
would
at
this
moment
be
irresistible
health
vigour
proportion
and
the
face
of
an
apollo
luckless
be
ever
the
youth
who
shall
presume
to
rival
you
give
you
ten
guineas
for
rosetta
filmar
will
you
sell
her
i
will
not
montgomery
though
you
seem
so
well
to
understand
our
mutual
value
he
drew
from
his
pocket
the
very
miniature
in
the
shagreen
case
your
walter
me
the
honour
filmar
to
accept
this
from
me
valmont
picture
and
of
your
painting
you
are
delirious
montgomery
not
i
never
more
rational
in
my
life
as
this
very
action
evinces
exquisitely
divinely
charming
as
she
is
who
would
stand
a
competition
against
your
person
rank
and
happy
influence
with
mr
valmont
with
mr
valmont
cried
overwhelm
me
with
your
perfections
this
morning
how
natural
that
start
nor
do
you
forget
the
grace
of
the
attitude
i
perceive
it
is
too
late
filmar
be
candid
we
will
not
quarrel
for
as
you
have
so
much
the
start
of
me
in
her
approbation
i
must
resign
with
a
good
grace
can
i
do
more
than
even
yield
to
my
rival
that
resemblance
of
her
enchanting
face
all
i
ask
in
return
is
to
oblige
me
in
kind
offices
with
mr
is
a
curst
strange
business
to
be
sure
but
on
my
soul
valmont
sent
me
to
town
to
study
i
have
no
time
to
spare
as
mum
you
know
as
to
my
i
shall
reform
ere
long
you
to
london
to
study
ha
ha
ha
by
heaven
he
did
to
this
emporium
of
delight
a
strange
being
so
are
you
for
montgomery
if
i
understand
your
meaning
concerning
and
miss
valmont
may
i
my
lord
sir
walter
strange
speech
and
your
confusion
kept
me
awake
two
hours
upon
my
soul
you
have
seen
her
i
know
you
have
and
i
am
sure
valmont
would
suffer
any
man
in
the
kingdom
to
look
at
her
except
the
one
whom
he
designs
for
her
husband
everything
corroborates
the
fact
you
told
me
the
earl
knew
valmont
but
did
you
ever
hint
in
the
most
remote
way
that
you
had
been
in
the
castle
till
sir
walter
question
obliged
you
to
have
recourse
to
that
portrait
in
the
drawing
room
to
excuse
the
implication
ah
filmar
a
divinity
is
destined
for
your
arms
whilst
i
must
sigh
in
secret
over
the
remembrance
of
past
hopes
wo
sigh
alone
montgomery
you
do
profess
anchorism
there
are
other
divinities
he
smiled
one
of
those
enchanting
smiles
which
will
probably
reduce
many
such
divinities
into
frail
mortals
and
then
he
enumerated
in
the
way
of
exclamation
a
number
of
his
favourite
beauties
wonder
you
want
to
give
up
miss
valmont
said
i
that
are
the
favoured
of
so
many
to
give
up
miss
valmont
lord
god
how
can
you
talk
so
ridiculously
filmar
want
to
give
up
an
angel
with
whom
it
were
life
to
die
to
live
from
whom
is
death
is
she
not
torn
from
my
arms
am
i
not
interdicted
and
another
elected
by
heavens
my
lord
your
secresy
was
unkind
but
this
triumph
is
insulting
and
thus
walter
we
passed
away
the
morning
he
affirming
i
denying
i
fairly
overshot
my
mark
in
leading
him
to
talk
so
often
of
sibella
for
he
has
tacked
together
such
a
number
of
scraps
and
ends
that
with
the
aid
of
his
colouring
make
proofs
as
strong
as
of
holy
well
and
if
he
does
speak
of
me
in
this
way
to
valmont
the
man
suspected
me
before
and
all
he
can
now
do
is
to
clap
another
padlock
on
his
caution
there
is
something
unmanly
in
montgomery
conduct
with
studied
vehemence
of
lamentation
he
recanted
his
many
many
former
insinuations
of
his
constant
security
in
miss
valmont
favour
and
unless
it
was
a
preconcerted
plan
between
them
which
i
do
not
think
possible
his
voluntary
resignation
of
her
picture
stamps
him
a
contemptible
my
fingers
had
a
kind
of
tremulous
impulse
towards
the
picture
yet
i
positively
refused
to
accept
it
a
double
dose
of
prudence
this
morning
made
some
amends
for
its
total
absence
last
evening
is
too
true
walter
i
left
the
club
again
without
a
penny
the
earl
will
not
be
in
town
till
next
week
and
till
i
am
in
cash
i
can
not
invent
or
contrive
a
probable
means
of
saving
my
friend
montgomery
the
disgrace
of
being
mistaken
this
youth
makes
a
rapid
progress
in
the
sciences
he
was
as
completely
inducted
last
night
as
your
humble
servant
his
tutor
janetta
laundy
also
is
most
admirably
chosen
and
if
valmont
deems
that
to
be
a
dupe
with
a
beggared
purse
and
shattered
constitution
is
the
antidote
against
society
montgomery
is
going
the
high
road
to
answer
all
his
wishes
your
hint
dear
knight
respecting
ashburn
was
not
lost
upon
me
but
though
i
would
not
marry
for
aught
but
money
i
should
like
to
have
a
wife
thrown
into
the
bargain
whom
i
could
love
now
and
then
i
acknowledge
the
widow
is
as
young
as
any
woman
of
her
years
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
and
in
wealth
i
should
be
an
emperor
but
indeed
walter
i
could
ruin
myself
as
effectually
i
feel
i
could
i
have
all
the
laudable
inclinations
necessary
thereto
with
a
large
fortune
as
with
a
moderate
one
and
then
age
will
come
and
gout
and
bile
and
ill
tempers
and
no
sweet
remembrances
of
smiles
of
dimpling
cheeks
of
melting
eyes
to
cheer
me
were
the
widow
once
turned
of
eighty
the
charms
of
youth
and
beauty
should
not
tempt
me
from
as
it
is
i
could
like
her
daughter
ah
but
miss
ashburn
is
a
searching
eye
she
would
enquire
for
thy
passport
of
virtue
and
morality
filmar
you
perceive
plainly
do
you
walter
that
i
have
no
alternative
but
taking
sibella
valmont
with
her
per
annum
you
have
now
seen
her
picture
tell
me
is
she
not
unequalled
and
may
i
not
sometimes
without
any
violent
effort
of
condescend
to
toy
away
an
hour
or
two
with
though
my
own
wife
a
creature
so
perfect
walter
walter
could
i
drench
in
oblivion
that
youth
with
the
flowing
beard
i
should
be
proud
to
acknowledge
how
often
i
dream
of
this
little
seducer
as
it
certainly
was
not
montgomery
who
could
it
be
and
why
came
he
there
this
interrogation
is
constantly
served
up
with
my
breakfast
it
even
attends
my
undressing
and
has
been
not
unfrequently
my
bedfellow
the
very
quintessence
of
politeness
however
it
never
intrudes
further
than
the
door
of
the
tavern
or
for
the
former
i
now
leave
it
and
thee
thine
filmar
letter
xviii
from
caroline
ashburn
to
arthur
murden
can
you
will
you
my
dear
friend
undertake
to
rescue
sibella
from
the
tyranny
at
present
exercised
over
her
if
you
will
write
me
instantly
three
lines
to
london
where
i
am
now
returning
from
that
place
i
will
relate
the
particulars
of
my
visit
to
valmont
which
will
also
include
my
reasons
for
this
now
i
only
write
while
i
change
horses
at
b
caroline
ashburn
letter
xix
from
arthur
murden
to
caroline
ashburn
madam
when
you
bid
me
live
and
live
for
sibella
i
shut
my
ears
against
the
voice
of
the
name
the
possibility
of
my
rescuing
sibella
and
the
light
and
sun
again
becomes
of
value
to
me
arthur
murden
letter
xx
from
caroline
ashburn
to
arthur
murden
inexorable
as
you
would
persuade
me
you
are
still
i
hope
to
conquer
you
yet
it
must
be
a
future
work
sibella
release
is
our
present
employment
and
though
i
am
not
surprised
at
your
readiness
to
undertake
it
i
am
truly
grateful
in
this
case
i
know
your
heart
and
your
benevolence
are
separated
for
determined
as
you
are
to
live
and
die
without
hope
every
step
that
carries
you
toward
her
increases
your
the
sacrifice
is
great
i
wish
you
would
trust
me
that
in
the
end
it
may
find
a
reward
the
inclosed
letter
you
must
yourself
give
to
sibella
valmont
may
lock
up
the
doors
of
his
castle
but
your
cell
and
pannel
is
not
under
his
dominion
your
hermit
cap
and
gown
secure
your
own
escape
be
sure
you
do
not
escape
alone
read
the
inclosed
and
you
will
find
i
mean
to
join
you
on
the
road
you
will
there
find
also
my
reason
for
not
being
of
your
party
through
the
subterraneous
passage
and
into
the
castle
to
yourself
i
leave
the
conduct
of
the
business
your
brain
is
fertile
in
project
and
on
your
faith
and
delicacy
in
execution
i
would
rely
as
on
my
own
soul
when
i
reached
valmont
park
valmont
sent
an
excuse
for
not
admitting
me
message
after
message
flew
from
the
moat
to
the
castle
and
i
was
compelled
to
stipulate
for
not
seeing
any
one
but
himself
ere
the
word
of
command
was
given
for
me
to
pass
he
received
me
with
a
demeanour
cold
formal
and
haughty
i
assured
him
that
a
motive
equal
to
the
pleasure
i
had
promised
myself
of
seeing
sibella
had
induced
me
to
take
the
journey
perfectly
understand
you
madam
said
he
once
for
all
to
save
you
the
trouble
of
useless
discussion
i
will
not
relax
an
atom
of
my
severity
till
miss
valmont
has
in
some
measure
expiated
her
fault
is
her
fault
sir
fault
repeated
he
starting
perceive
madam
you
are
a
stranger
to
the
cursed
business
and
may
you
remain
so
for
your
own
for
her
and
her
family
sake
clement
montgomery
concerned
he
bit
his
lip
arose
from
his
seat
stifled
anger
contracting
his
brow
see
he
is
said
i
said
valmont
sternly
understanding
should
inform
you
that
affairs
which
concern
the
honour
of
a
family
are
only
to
be
canvassed
by
the
individuals
immediately
belonging
to
it
forget
sir
replied
i
i
am
a
female
and
according
to
your
creed
can
not
possess
is
it
owing
to
this
deficiency
that
i
am
of
opinion
the
honour
of
a
family
as
generally
understood
is
a
matter
quite
opposite
to
the
virtue
of
a
in
the
present
case
i
think
you
clasp
your
honour
and
turn
your
virtue
and
justice
out
of
if
when
you
use
such
terms
in
speaking
of
sibella
you
allude
to
her
contract
with
clement
i
acknowledge
her
in
the
wrong
to
ratify
that
contract
sir
would
be
a
worse
error
for
he
is
undeserving
of
her
but
all
that
and
the
worst
of
errors
she
can
commit
may
ascribe
their
origin
to
yourself
you
are
obliging
but
you
have
not
yet
convinced
me
i
am
under
any
necessity
of
explaining
myself
to
whatever
offences
clement
has
committed
against
me
he
shall
not
fail
of
his
proper
punishment
trust
me
he
shall
i
i
will
you
take
any
refreshment
madam
rising
regret
valmont
is
too
much
indisposed
to
receive
pardon
me
our
conference
must
you
will
excuse
me
but
i
can
not
suffer
you
to
see
miss
it
is
indeed
impossible
i
declined
the
refreshment
lamented
for
valmont
and
objected
to
putting
an
end
to
the
conference
and
this
last
produced
an
altercation
too
diffuse
and
passionate
to
be
related
minutely
i
mentioned
fortune
he
almost
started
with
surprise
he
said
i
could
not
have
heard
it
from
her
for
he
had
refused
her
permission
to
write
to
i
replied
believe
my
informant
was
her
he
called
some
earl
a
lying
scoundrel
and
added
after
a
moment
pause
that
now
it
was
useless
to
keep
it
longer
secret
that
miss
valmont
was
her
father
heiress
since
the
object
of
its
being
concealed
was
utterly
destroyed
he
had
planned
the
concealment
for
her
benefit
and
carried
it
into
execution
only
to
perfect
her
happiness
she
had
indeed
a
noble
fortune
he
said
ill
bestowed
none
of
his
should
go
the
same
way
and
as
to
the
pragmatical
puppy
who
took
the
pains
to
tell
her
of
it
his
scheme
by
the
disclosure
was
effectually
annihilated
as
you
murden
have
no
striking
characteristics
of
the
puppy
i
took
the
liberty
of
asking
valmont
if
he
knew
the
person
to
whom
he
alluded
well
he
replied
well
it
was
the
son
of
sibella
other
guardian
who
wanted
her
wealth
to
amend
his
poverty
believe
not
said
i
i
am
assured
of
it
he
bribed
some
of
the
fools
of
my
family
to
admit
him
they
confess
the
charge
absolutely
but
they
prevaricated
and
talked
backwards
and
forwards
in
such
a
way
as
confirmed
their
guilt
backwards
and
forwards
sir
said
i
proceeds
from
confusion
and
awe
i
am
very
much
inclined
to
believe
your
servants
innocent
in
this
affair
mr
valmont
ashburn
is
extremely
inclined
to
construe
all
i
say
or
do
in
the
way
that
best
pleases
her
but
sibella
herself
saw
this
person
and
herself
gave
me
the
information
i
know
too
and
know
what
you
are
going
to
advance
madam
she
might
tell
you
as
she
did
me
of
his
feigned
name
he
called
himself
some
murden
a
friend
of
clement
he
persuaded
her
to
believe
him
to
be
sir
have
a
friend
called
murden
and
so
had
clement
montgomery
might
it
not
be
him
madam
it
might
not
replied
valmont
no
person
but
her
two
guardians
ever
knew
a
whisper
of
sibella
fortune
i
tell
you
the
earl
disclosed
it
to
his
son
because
he
wanted
his
son
to
marry
i
refused
their
offer
and
their
residence
lately
in
this
neighbourhood
confirms
the
rest
more
you
are
mistaken
valmont
hear
me
out
sir
for
his
fiery
impatience
was
again
blazing
forth
the
secret
was
first
unfolded
i
know
not
but
in
the
immediate
agency
of
conveying
this
intelligence
to
sibella
the
guardian
you
speak
of
had
no
concern
whatever
i
am
much
better
informed
than
you
perhaps
may
imagine
valmont
you
discharged
your
servants
from
passion
not
from
conviction
i
pledge
myself
to
prove
the
truth
of
my
affection
if
you
will
let
us
make
a
compromise
liberate
sibella
give
her
to
my
care
one
month
and
i
will
tell
you
who
the
person
was
and
for
your
future
security
how
he
gained
admission
into
your
park
to
catch
eagles
i
grant
madam
you
are
amazingly
condescending
but
as
the
days
of
enchantment
are
passed
i
am
as
well
instructed
on
the
latter
point
as
i
wish
to
be
for
my
i
am
also
provided
the
suspicious
part
of
my
household
are
gone
and
i
think
i
have
secured
the
fidelity
of
the
rest
your
request
concerning
miss
valmont
passing
from
my
care
to
your
madam
is
not
worthy
of
an
answer
somewhat
indignantly
i
reminded
him
that
an
abuse
of
power
might
be
the
forfeiture
of
power
and
that
the
law
useless
as
it
is
for
the
relief
of
general
oppression
might
reach
this
particular
instance
despise
your
threats
madam
said
valmont
i
do
your
intreaties
the
will
of
the
hon
honorius
valmont
delegated
to
me
the
care
of
her
person
till
the
age
of
then
whoever
aspires
to
the
protection
of
a
disgraced
dishonoured
woman
may
claim
it
but
till
then
madam
i
swear
that
in
the
solitude
and
confinement
of
this
castle
she
shall
weep
for
her
errors
depend
upon
it
madam
whilst
you
favour
us
with
your
abode
in
any
part
of
this
country
the
rigour
of
her
imprisonment
shall
be
tenfold
and
so
saying
he
rang
the
bell
furiously
and
would
have
departed
sir
one
moment
cried
i
and
then
after
a
pause
i
promised
to
quit
the
country
instantly
if
he
would
suffer
me
to
converse
one
quarter
of
an
hour
with
valmont
pray
show
this
lady
to
your
mistress
dressing
room
said
he
sneeringly
to
the
servant
that
appeared
would
be
well
in
your
wisdom
madam
to
make
valmont
influence
of
consequence
before
you
attempt
to
gain
valmont
influence
valmont
having
worn
out
the
variety
of
fancied
indispositions
is
now
fairly
dying
of
inanity
she
was
neither
surprised
at
my
visit
nor
at
all
interested
by
that
which
she
herself
called
the
lamentable
state
of
her
niece
valmont
was
attended
by
her
confidential
servant
whom
i
requested
to
remain
in
the
apartment
for
i
judged
i
should
from
her
gain
more
information
than
from
her
lady
and
i
judged
rightly
she
was
not
only
willing
but
eager
to
tell
me
all
she
knew
it
seems
valmont
has
had
two
interviews
with
his
niece
the
first
was
on
her
leaving
you
in
the
ruin
when
valmont
was
irritated
by
her
persisting
to
declare
herself
married
to
strike
her
she
did
throw
herself
into
the
moat
but
she
received
no
injury
from
that
time
he
ordered
her
to
be
confined
in
the
second
interview
a
painful
circumstance
relating
to
sibella
transpired
in
consequence
of
which
her
uncle
abruptly
commanded
her
from
his
presence
the
discovery
he
had
made
wounded
him
almost
to
madness
and
his
first
transports
of
rage
have
subsided
into
a
constant
gloomy
moroseness
at
times
he
has
been
seen
to
weep
the
circumstance
i
speak
of
has
been
whispered
from
one
to
another
throughout
the
family
and
in
this
way
alone
travelled
to
valmont
for
mortified
pride
would
choak
valmont
attempt
were
he
inclined
to
give
the
secret
utterance
i
can
trace
the
operations
of
his
pride
but
i
am
lost
with
respect
to
his
tears
for
sibella
never
possessed
any
of
his
affection
my
tears
flowed
without
restraint
when
i
learned
this
distressing
circumstance
and
heard
also
that
our
sibella
droops
under
her
cruelty
she
eats
little
sighs
deeply
but
weeps
seldom
was
unnecessary
to
enjoin
silence
to
her
domestics
for
she
never
attempts
to
speak
to
them
they
frequently
hear
her
talk
of
some
letter
which
she
holds
up
between
her
clasped
hands
as
she
traverses
her
apartment
in
extreme
agitation
and
then
she
exclaims
never
never
wrote
it
once
a
day
she
is
conducted
to
the
terrace
but
her
wood
and
all
her
beloved
haunts
are
forbidden
you
murden
could
not
have
borne
the
apathy
with
which
these
and
other
particulars
were
repeated
nor
could
valmont
with
all
my
reasoning
be
prevailed
on
to
suppose
that
she
who
had
been
so
long
governed
should
now
infringe
on
her
obedience
and
endeavour
to
give
aid
and
comfort
to
her
ill
treated
niece
i
had
quitted
valmont
in
anger
i
quitted
valmont
in
sorrow
as
i
crossed
the
square
court
in
front
of
the
building
i
stopped
and
looked
up
with
an
eye
of
tears
to
sibella
windows
no
pale
melancholy
form
appeared
to
my
salute
miss
valmont
said
i
to
the
servant
attending
me
the
same
apartments
as
formerly
the
man
looked
round
every
way
and
replied
in
the
affirmative
scarcely
was
i
reseated
in
the
carriage
when
i
began
to
accuse
myself
as
wanting
friendship
and
humanity
when
i
foolishly
promised
valmont
to
quit
the
country
murden
would
not
have
done
this
thought
i
then
murden
is
the
fittest
person
to
repair
the
error
and
before
i
arrived
at
b
i
had
resolved
to
engage
you
to
take
her
from
this
proud
this
cruel
uncle
i
have
only
now
to
tell
you
why
i
hastened
on
to
london
to
procure
her
an
asylum
the
very
term
proves
to
you
that
ashburn
house
is
out
of
the
question
if
you
know
beville
the
sister
of
davenport
you
know
a
very
amiable
woman
who
will
open
her
arms
and
heart
for
the
reception
of
sibella
it
is
not
my
design
to
make
either
her
retreat
or
the
means
used
in
her
escape
a
secret
but
if
it
is
possible
to
prevent
clement
montgomery
seeing
her
that
i
will
do
to
shield
her
from
valmont
we
must
oppose
authority
it
was
a
strange
in
me
not
to
learn
the
name
of
her
other
guardian
let
me
beseech
you
my
dear
friend
to
arm
yourself
with
fortitude
if
the
circumstance
to
which
i
allude
in
a
part
of
this
letter
betrays
its
own
authenticity
to
you
i
know
your
heart
will
be
rent
with
agony
yet
persevere
ah
i
need
not
say
that
in
itself
it
includes
every
incitement
to
her
relief
use
no
speed
on
my
account
for
i
shall
be
unknown
in
that
obscure
village
seven
miles
the
other
side
of
b
where
you
must
stop
for
me
let
me
know
when
i
may
be
there
and
in
waiting
for
you
i
can
have
no
other
impatience
than
of
being
assured
you
are

safety

need
i
add
a
stronger
recommendation
ah
no
thus
commissioned
you
will
instantly
assure
yourself
he
is
benevolent
noble
just
and
has
not
one
fault
in
his
nature
that
counteracts
the
propriety
of
choosing
him
for
your

i
have
lately
been
in

sibella
i
have
seen
your
cruel
uncle
your
insensible
aunt
but
she
for
whose
sake
i
encountered

was
secluded
from

i
know

of

yes
my

there
you
have
endured
enough
come
away
follow

by

is
not
apt

to
smile
yet
believe
me
his
heart
will
rejoice
in
your
deliverance
though
his

may
talk
of
nothing
but
woe
but
i
dare
not
come
your

were
he
to
find

in

he
would
suspect
a

relieve
you

by

counteract
it

have

this

commit
yourself
wholly

he
will
bring
you
my

with
all
convenient
dispatch
to

fifteen
miles
from

letter
xxii
from
george
valmont
to
clement
montgomery
sir
on
the
very
day
i
received
your
answer
to
my
last
letter
i
discovered
a
circumstance
which
rendered
that
answer
quite
unnecessary
except
to
prove
that
you
are
not
only
a
villain
but
a
cowardly
villain
i
should
have
given
to
myself
the
satisfaction
of
telling
you
thus
much
before
but
i
delayed
for
two
reasons
the
first
till
i
had
completely
banished
every
struggling
effort
of
the
affection
i
once
had
for
you
almost
the
only
affection
i
ever
had
in
my
life
and
the
second
perhaps
a
very
consoling
one
to
you
until
i
had
executed
the
deed
which
comes
herewith
by
which
under
certain
annexed
conditions
you
are
entitled
to
the
possession
of
for
life
however
you
may
be
obliged
by
the
action
you
have
but
little
obligation
to
the
i
hate
and
detest
you
cordially
but
i
would
not
for
my
honour
sake
give
up
to
absolute
beggary
own
my
only
yes
sir
not
legitimate
i
confess
but
in
the
strongest
acceptance
of
the
term
i
cared
not
ten
straws
for
your
mother
yet
from
your
birth
i
felt
a
strange
propensity
to
love
you
i
schemed
and
planned
for
your
advantage
for
your
sake
alone
i
contrived
a
project
by
which
all
the
united
wealth
of
the
valmont
house
would
have
been
showered
on
your
head
i
intended
mark
me
sir
you
should
marry
my
niece
and
take
my
name
burying
the
disgrace
of
your
birth
in
the
nobleness
of
my
possessions
and
as
i
abhorred
that
a
man
who
bore
my
name
should
abandon
himself
to
the
love
of
society
i
sent
you
into
the
world
as
poor
and
adopted
that
you
might
experience
its
disappointments
and
know
how
to
value
your
proper
amply
have
you
rewarded
my
extreme
love
and
constant
labour
i
patiently
undergo
this
statement
because
i
would
have
you
see
exactly
where
you
might
have
stood
and
where
you
stand
the
conditions
of
your
present
independence
are
that
you
never
come
into
my
presence
if
you
once
intrude
by
letter
or
otherwise
i
wipe
away
the
allowance
and
every
trace
of
consideration
for
you
also
the
instant
you
form
any
species
of
intercourse
with
miss
valmont
the
deed
is
cancelled
even
this
paltry
sum
as
it
is
mine
shall
not
help
to
support
infamy
ingratitude
and
make
the
comparison
sir
between
and
per
annum
ha
does
it
gall
you
so
may
it
ever
may
rest
fly
from
your
pillow
and
contentment
from
your
heart
and
men
you
will
know
what
i
have
experienced
since
i
discovered
the
indelible
stain
you
have
fixed
on
my
family
my
equally
worthless
niece
perhaps
may
when
she
is
her
own
mistress
be
inclined
to
reward
your
conduct
with
her
hand
for
if
i
may
judge
by
her
reception
of
your
letter
when
i
gave
it
her
she
is
not
more
the
fool
of
inclination
than
of
remember
she
never
possesses
one
penny
of
mine
if
you
really
have
any
friend
of
the
name
of
murden
pray
offer
him
my
very
sincere
thanks
but
for
his
timely
interference
i
might
have
given
you
a
part
of
your
intended
inheritance
before
i
discovered
your
conduct
in
the
moment
of
acknowledging
you
my
son
i
renounce
you
for
ever
i
cast
you
from
my
affection
and
memory
and
should
you
henceforth
think
of
me
know
that
you
have
an
inveterate
implacable
enemy
in
your

letter
xxiii
from
arthur
murden
to
caroline
ashburn
madam
i
date
my
letter
from
the
farm
richardson
is
my
confidant
he
has
a
sincere
generous
mind
i
stood
before
him
confessed
in
all
my
folly
he
will
give
me
his
utmost
aid
do
not
again
call
me
inexorable
dear
miss
ashburn
i
have
yielded
greatly
indeed
to
you
i
consulted
a
physician
at
as
we
are
so
speedily
to
meet
it
would
be
useless
to
conceal
from
you
that
wherever
it
had
its
beginning
the
disorder
is
not
now
confined
to
my
mind
youth
the
physician
said
was
in
my
favour
the
continent
might
do
me
service
he
ordered
some
medicine
regulated
my
diet
and
when
i
told
him
of
my
leaving
the
hall
immediately
he
shook
my
hand
conviction
speaking
from
his
countenance
that
it
was
his
last
salute
to
me
a
few
restorative
medicines
furnished
me
with
strength
to
reach
the
here
my
purpose
nerves
but
why
do
you
bid
me
fortify
my
heart
oh
my
dear
madam
it
has
been
long
since
fortified
from
the
fatal
night
when
she
gave
herself
to
the
arms
of
clement
my
heart
became
callous
impenetrable
to
the
dart
of
any
new
calamity
and
sometimes
too
i
smile
miss
ashburn
it
is
amazing
into
what
familiar
habits
of
intimacy
i
and
the
misery
that
abides
with
me
have
fallen
fear
me
not
in
this
enterprise
i
have
all
the
determination
of
will
all
the
vigour
of
everything
is
prepared
last
night
accompanied
by
richardson
who
from
his
zealous
apprehensions
for
my
safety
would
not
suffer
me
to
go
alone
i
visited
the
no
interrupters
have
been
there
the
cell
the
stone
and
the
passage
are
still
at
our
richardson
is
too
honest
to
make
an
improper
use
of
the
secret
of
this
ruin
nay
he
was
the
first
to
remind
me
it
would
be
just
when
our
purpose
was
effected
to
give
valmont
its
description
again
i
repeat
every
thing
is
prepared
i
only
wait
for
you
to
inform
me
of
the
nearest
connection
between
her
apartments
and
the
armoury
a
blunder
might
be
fatal
when
you
have
given
me
this
necessary
information
quit
london
to
meet
us
instantly
for
the
night
succeeding
the
receipt
of
your
letter
sibella
shall
bid
adieu
to
her
dungeon
direct
to
richardson
stantorfarm
w
murden
you
blame
with
great
justice
the
little
power
i
possess
of
detaching
myself
from
the
affairs
of
my
last
time
i
wrote
it
escaped
me
till
my
letter
was
gone
and
now
i
have
torn
open
the
seal
to
tell
you
that
mademoiselle
laundy
is
an
abandoned
woman
mistress
in
paris
and
though
i
have
no
positive
proof
i
venture
to
assert
she
holds
the
same
station
in
london
if
it
suits
you
to
inform
ashburn
of
her
companion
principles
on
the
authority
of
my
name
it
is
wholly
at
your
service
letter
xxiv
from
janetta
laundy
to
clement
montgomery
i
ought
to
reproach
you
but
dear
and
irresistible
as
you
are
your
image
montgomery
banishes
every
thing
but
sensations
of
pleasure
what
can
be
the
reason
of
your
sudden
gloom
and
distraction
i
am
sure
the
loss
of
your
money
can
not
be
all
because
you
know
how
easily
you
may
be
supplied
by
ashburn
till
you
have
further
remittances
why
should
you
hesitate
when
i
assure
you
she
would
be
obliged
by
your
making
the
demand
recollect
her
own
words
the
evening
she
compelled
you
to
use
her
at
the
faro
table
and
if
you
will
not
allow
me
to
urge
you
on
another
point
at
least
be
persuaded
to
spare
yourself
fruitless
anxiety
about
your
losses
at
play
still
i
fear
there
is
something
else
and
will
you
not
tell
it
to
janetta
to
your
own
janetta
who
has
sacrificed
her
peace
to
you
what
it
is
that
thus
distresses
you
do
you
remember
how
you
behaved
last
night
i
was
terrified
to
death
at
your
appearance
i
asked
if
you
were
you
struck
your
hand
on
your
forehead
and
said
you
were
undone
the
beauteous
sibella
inconstant
asked
mrs
i
shall
never
forget
the
manner
of
your
answer
you
spoke
through
your
shut
teeth
madam
she
has
ruined
me
then
whirling
round
you
caught
my
hand
and
exclaimed
laundy
i
am
indeed
undone
how
i
trembled
i
tremble
now
to
think
of
it
for
god
sake
my
dear
beloved
montgomery
be
careful
the
hated
the
prying
miss
ashburn
was
by
and
if
she
never
suspected
us
before
i
am
sure
she
does
now
you
went
up
to
lady
barlowe
and
asked
her
fiercely
for
her
nephew
murden
sir
said
miss
ashburn
looking
at
you
with
such
scorn
i
could
have
killed
her
murden
sir
is
at
present
a
sort
of
wandering
knight
errant
sometime
within
a
fortnight
you
will
hear
certain
tidings
of
him
he
may
be
in
london
it
seemed
as
if
you
came
only
to
ask
this
question
for
you
went
away
soon
after
and
though
you
strove
to
be
gayer
you
sighed
so
deeply
i
could
scarcely
contain
myself
i
wept
all
night
and
now
i
am
writing
instead
of
dressing
how
dear
to
me
every
employment
that
has
a
concern
with
my
charming
montgomery
i
know
not
what
excuse
i
shall
make
at
dinner
for
my
melancholy
appearance
but
fears
for
my
own
safety
are
swallowed
up
in
my
apprehensions
for
you
luckily
the
dutchess
is
confined
with
a
i
will
visit
her
and
on
my
way
call
on
you
so
prepare
to
confide
all
your
griefs
to
the
sympathizing
bosom
of
your
janetta
miss
ashburn
two
hours
ago
received
a
letter
which
seemed
to
give
her
great
pleasure
and
while
she
was
reading
it
lord
filmar
came
in
when
she
had
finished
the
letter
she
turned
to
him
i
hear
you
speak
of
some
one
being
ill
my
lord
yes
madam
i
was
enquiring
whether
montgomery
came
here
last
night
to
seek
physicians
or
a
nurse
i
called
on
him
yesterday
morning
and
the
servant
said
his
master
was
very
bad
dreadfully
bad
too
bad
to
be
seen
i
sent
after
dinner
and
he
was
worse
i
drove
to
his
lodgings
just
now
to
make
my
adieus
before
i
leave
town
and
still
he
was
so
bad
i
could
not
be
let
in
yet
i
met
miss
trevors
who
tells
me
he
was
of
the
party
here
last
evening
a
little
out
of
spirits
indeed
but
quite
as
handsome
as
ever
he
is
bad
my
lord
replied
miss
ashburn
fixing
her
eyes
on
me
i
can
very
well
credit
and
ere
long
i
shall
endeavour
to
point
out
some
persons
who
have
the
same
infectious
disorders
unless
you
had
seen
her
look
you
ca
tell
half
the
meaning
this
after
reading
her
letter
again
she
told
ashburn
she
was
going
out
of
town
immediately
and
being
asked
where
she
said
that
could
not
be
explained
till
her
return
her
chaise
is
ordered
and
i
am
delighted
to
think
she
ca
interrupt
us
when
she
is
away
dear
too
dear

faithful

letter
xxv
from
caroline
ashburn
to
arthur
murden
the
long
narrow
passage
where
you
met
those
three
men
you
spoke
of
connects
the
tower
with
the
south
wing
there
you
will
find
a
flight
of
stone
stairs
by
which
she
used
to
descend
to
the
armoury
those
stairs
will
conduct
you
into
the
gallery
belonging
to
sibella
apartments
her
uncle
fond
of
magnificence
appropriated
to
her
use
solely
all
the
suite
of
rooms
on
that
floor
of
the
wing
she
may
be
secured
by
lock
and
key
but
i
do
not
suppose
any
one
is
permitted
to
sleep
near
her
of
that
you
must
run
the
hazard
do
not
wonder
my
lines
are
uneven
for
i
actually
tremble
while
i
follow
you
in
imagination
to
that
gallery
were
i
writing
to
any
one
but
yourself
i
should
bid
you
blend
boldness
and
caution
you
have
done
it
already
ah
my
sweet
friend
my
sibella
but
i
forgot
that
you
are
a
stranger
my
sibella
to
nervous
the
first
word
of
his
errand
will
bless
you
no
murden
mere
assertion
though
aided
by
the
authority
of
your
name
will
not
convince
ashburn
of
her
companion
proflicacy
if
i
can
not
fairly
and
fully
detect
her
practices
i
can
never
remove
her
the
affair
must
rest
till
my
return
and
then
i
will
try
my
utmost
i
thank
you
for
your
information
and
i
have
this
morning
given
miss
laundy
an
information
that
i
understand
her
a
surprising
alteration
is
displayed
in
montgomery
valmont
i
conclude
has
begun
his
explanation
is
approaching
and
do
you
my
friend
school
yourself
before
you
and
he
meet
and
then
you
will
not
cease
to
befriend
him
though
he
may
cease
to
befriend
himself

letter
xxvi
from
clement
montgomery
to
janetta
laundy
and
is
it
come
to
this
you
urged
the
secret
from
me
i
would
fain
have
withheld
and
now
do
you
also
give
me
up
to
despair
oh
janetta
janetta
have
i
deserved
it
of
you
what
was
there
in
that
cruel
letter
of
valmont
which
should
chill
the
ardour
of
love
his
anger
has
blasted
all
the
fair
promises
of
my
life
but
it
could
not
transform
me
into
age
or
ugliness
still
am
i
though
wretched
and
desperate
thy
montgomery
still
adoring
thy
beauty
panting
for
thy
charms
forgive
me
if
these
reproaches
are
injurious
to
your
tenderness
if
you
yet
love
me
forgive
me
alas
you
love
me
not
you
turn
from
me
with
an
averted
eye
you
repulse
my
caresses
you
give
me
up
to
misery
and
despair
and
the
wretched
montgomery
dies
under
your
neglect
farewel
my
janetta
oh
farewel
farewel
then
to
all
the
blooming
pleasures
which
i
gathered
with
an
eager
hand
my
sentence
is
without
appeal
valmont
that
a
father
should
be
so
cruel
dooms
me
to
poverty
and
disgrace
can
i
exist
in
poverty
no
by
heaven
shall
i
languish
in
a
sordid
dwelling
with
there
food
and
covering
and
sicken
over
the
remembrance
of
past
enjoyments
shall
i
live
to
crawl
along
with
steps
enfeebled
by
misfortune
and
view
the
splendid
equipages
of
those
who
were
once
my
associates
pass
me
unheeded
no
i
can
not
endure
it
some
way
or
other
i
must
end
it
all
the
means
of
making
life
desirable
are
denied
me
i
blush
at
my
unmerited
disgrace
i
would
hide
myself
from
every
eye
save
your
janetta
and
when
the
fatal
tidings
are
divulged
abroad
i
shall
surely
expire
with
torture
yet
be
once
more
kind
my
charmer
if
thou
hast
no
kindness
for
the
unfortunate
montgomery
this
once
at
least
affect
it
thou
hast
known
misfortune
have
pity
on
me
come
and
listen
to
my
sighs
let
me
breathe
a
sorrowful
farewel
on
thy
bosom
i
shall
not
ask
this
indulgence
a
second
time
i
will
fly
to
bury
in
solitude
the
short
remnant
of
a
miserable
then
come
and
once
more
bid
my
heart
throb
with
rapturous
sensations
bid
me
for
a
moment
forget
my
doom
remembering
only
what
i
have
been
the
blissful
moment
ended

farewel
to
all
clement
montgomery
letter
xxvii
from
janetta
laundy
to
clement
montgomery
it
is
very
strange
i
should
express
myself
so
ill
as
to
have
my
emotions
of
sorrow
and
regret
mistaken
by
you
for
coldness
and
aversion
it
is
cruel
montgomery
thus
to
accuse
your
janetta
could
i
but
describe
the
anguish
i
suffered
both
on
your
account
and
my
own
you
would
pity
me
yes
montgomery
is
i
should
ask
for
pity
i
who
never
till
now
knew
how
strong
are
the
ties
by
which
my
rival
held
you
barbarous
as
she
is
i
fear
you
still
love
her
she
thinks
only
how
she
can
most
effectually
work
your
ruin
while
you
charge
with
neglect
and
unkindness
the
faithful
janetta
who
is
labouring
to
redress
your
misfortunes
montgomery
there
is
but
one
way
to
talk
of
dying
is
absurd
you
may
feel
a
temporary
languor
the
effect
of
vapour
and
indigestion
but
the
bloom
and
vigour
of
a
constitution
like
your
is
not
so
easily
undermined
trust
me
you
will
live
to
a
good
old
age
even
with
the
despicable
per
annum
your
hard
hearted
father
bestows
on
you
but
it
is
in
your
power
montgomery
to
live
surrounded
by
riches
and
splendor
to
command
the
perpetual
succession
of
pleasures
which
riches
and
splendor
can
procure
remember
the
proposal
i
made
you
one
day
half
in
earnest
half
in
jest
think
of
it
embrace
it
and
send
valmont
back
his
paltry
annuity
in
disdain
you
can
not
be
so
blind
so
mad
as
to
reject
this
only
means
of
your
happiness
renounce
it
and
i
shall
believe
you
reserve
yourself
for
my
rival
the
faithless
and
barbarous
sibella
accept
it
and
all
the
delights
which
janetta
love
can
bestow
are
your
for
ever
why
should
you
hide
yourself
that
form
and
face
were
given
for
better
purposes
bloom
in
success
and
victory
and
leave
to
those
who
possess
not
your
advantages
to
mope
in
dull
obscurity
you
owe
to
yourself
this
triumph
over
the
malice
of
valmont
and
the
cruelty
of
her
who
has
so
wantonly
betrayed
you
to
his
wrath
throw
off
your
foibles
and
your
sorrow
and
call
up
those
alluring
graces
of
your
mien
which
are
so
irresistible
exchange
your
sighs
for
smiles
and
aided
by
the
advantages
of
dress
you
well
know
how
to
choose
come
here
to
dinner
i
have
contrived
that
we
shall
dine
alone
weigh
well
what
i
advise
and
its
motives
and
then
ask
yourself
if
i
deserve
to
be
accused
of
unkindness
ask
yourself
what
that
love
must
be
which
can
content
itself
with
secret
confessions
and
can
yield
its
open
triumph
to
another
in
order
to
secure
your
advantage
consider
these
things
with
attention
dearest
montgomery
and
convince
me
that
you
deserve
all
i
am
willing
to
do
for
you
by
your
instant
compliance
i
can
not
do
not
doubt
you
be
here
by

scoundrel
by

divine
sibella
has
escaped
me
i
have
no
doubt
you
or
some
of
your
diabolical
agents
are
concerned
in
the
the
deed
sir
i
have
your
draught
of
it
must
help
to
amuse
you
it
delights
me
to
think
she
is
not
yet
nineteen
and
that
you
are
pennyless
beg
at
my
gates
if
you
dare
the
worst
of
indignities
are
better
than
your
you

give
you

i
could
give
you
destruction
george
valmont
letter
xxix
from
clement
montgomery
to
george
valmont
since
sir
you
have
extended
my
punishment
to
the
utmost
i
can
incur
no
heavier
penalty
by
thus
intruding
myself
before
you
i
could
offer
many
excuses
sir
for
my
first
fault
but
it
is
now
too
late
only
i
must
say
your
harshness
and
severity
drove
us
to
that
measure
which
in
justice
to
myself
i
must
also
inform
you
miss
valmont
proposed
and
with
which
i
but
reluctantly
complied
but
sir
your
further
charge
is
without
foundation
i
have
neither
any
concern
in
nor
any
knowledge
of
miss
valmont
flight
and
further
to
prove
that
i
would
have
obeyed
you
if
i
could
i
shall
refuse
to
protect
indeed
sir
your
last
letter
has
driven
me
immediately
to
ratify
an
engagement
that
precludes
the
possibility
of
any
further
intercourse
with
miss
valmont
i
remain
sir
your
unhappy
and
repentant
son
clement

letter
xxx
from
arthur
murden
to
caroline
ashburn
there
she
is
madam
she
walks
and
sighs
and
one
little
room
a
small
circumference
contains
murden
and
sibella
when
the
waiter
shut
the
door
and
withdrew
i
would
have
given
an
eye
to
have
detained
she
knows
not
i
am
writing
to
you
for
she
would
have
taken
the
office
on
herself
and
that
would
not
satisfy
it
is
a
relief
madam
to
write
tho
any
thing
upon
earth
would
be
preferable
to
hearing
i
mean
miss
ashburn
till
i
saw
her
i
did
not
understand
well
might
you
warn
me
it
will
be
three
hours
before
we
reach
i
send
this
letter
by
a
man
and
horse
because
in
knowing
that
we
are
safe
you
will
have
at
least
half
an
hour
of
less
anxiety
the
place
where
we
are
now
is
only
a
village
five
miles
out
of
the
road
to
richardson
advised
me
to
make
this
sweep
for
fear
of
a
he
brought
us
here
through
cross
roads
on
his
own
horses
i
have
sent
him
back
and
the
only
chaise
this
little
inn
maintains
is
engaged
for
a
two
hours
airing
for
some
invalid
in
the
have
patience
your
friend
is
safe
richardson
and
myself
possessed
ourselves
of
the
cell
at
half
past
nine
last
then
in
our
disguises
we
prowled
around
the
castle
till
about
eleven
and
heard
the
locking
of
doors
and
saw
in
the
upper
windows
light
after
light
die
away
as
their
possessors
yielded
themselves
to
rest
we
would
not
venture
too
early
i
believe
it
was
past
two
before
we
left
the
all
was
the
stairs
the
gallery
her
apartments
i
seized
richardson
by
the
arm
as
he
attempted
to
turn
the
it
seemed
profanation
i
feared
every
thing
i
would
have
gone
richardson
forbade
me
we
entered
the
antichamber
we
crossed
two
others
the
door
of
a
third
stood
in
that
there
was
a
fire
a
candle
and
a
the
curtains
were
undrawn
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
face
instantly
i
drew
the
door
so
close
as
only
to
admit
my
hand
holding
out
your
i
for
me
i
said
to
richardson
miss
ashburn
dear
miss
valmont
said
he
ashburn
sends
you
this
i
heard
her
start
from
the
what
ashburn
repeated
richardson
ashburn
it
is
a
letter
from
miss
ashburn
she
took
or
rather
snatched
the
letter
and
as
i
withdrew
my
hand
she
shut
the
door
hastily
i
heard
her
utter
an
exclamation
i
could
hear
her
too
burst
into
sobs
and
bless
i
heard
her
also
name
another
at
length
she
asked
without
opening
the
door
if
i
was
indeed
murden
and
if
i
could
take
her
from
the
castle
yes
yes
said
i
away
she
replied
she
was
dressed
in
an
instant
she
opened
the
door
she
came
out
to
what
what
is
the
matter
cried
she
extending
her
arms
as
if
to
save
me
from
why
were
you
not
more
explicit
in
your
letter
miss
ashburn
i
recoiled
from
the
remembrance
of
her
clement
and
as
i
leaned
on
richardson
shoulder
i
closed
my
dim
eyes
and
wished
they
might
never
more
open
upon
recollection
whispered
richardson
are
unmanned
and
so
i
am
miss
ashburn
i
think
too
i
should
love
revenge
i
feel
a
rankling
glow
of
satisfaction
as
she
walks
past
my
chair
that
i
have
so
placed
it
i
can
not
look
up
and
behold
her
i
recovered
strength
and
courage
while
my
horror
remained
she
saw
i
could
hear
and
she
began
to
pour
forth
the
effusions
of
her
gratitude
upon
you
and
she
knew
you
had
been
in
the
castle
her
cruel
uncle
had
informed
her
of
then
said
she
fancied
i
must
die
without
seeing
any
one
that
ever
loved
me
as
she
spoke
i
turned
my
eyes
from
her
now
haggard
and
jaundiced
face
to
my
own
reflected
in
the
mirror
by
which
i
was
standing
corpses
said
i
to
myself
encumber
ye
the
fair
earth
showed
me
a
letter
too
added
she
said
clement
had
renounced
ah
valmont
deceiving
mr
valmont
and
she
waved
her
hand
gracefully
you
known
sibella
heart
as
she
knows
clement
you
away
said
i
you
no
other
preparation
to
make
madam
asked
richardson
night
is
very
cold
this
reminded
her
of
a
she
enquired
if
she
must
swim
across
the
moat
and
said
she
was
sure
she
could
swim
for
she
knew
why
she
had
failed
i
bade
richardson
lead
her
i
expected
to
have
seen
her
much
more
surprised
at
the
strange
path
through
which
she
had
to
from
the
armoury
to
the
cell
she
never
spoke
her
mind
was
overcharged
with
swelling
at
times
we
were
obliged
to
stand
still
she
even
panted
for
freer
respiration
the
i
heard
i
expected
our
it
is
some
travellers
who
have
stopped
to
bait
after
we
had
safely
crossed
the
moat
she
alternately
grasped
our
hands
in
a
tumult
of
joy
named
you
named
me
but
on
the
theme
of
clement
she
rode
behind
i
see
she
is
much
worse
for
the
journey
yet
her
burning
eye
and
vehement
spirits
would
persuade
me
otherwise
she
kindly
ceased
her
torturing
questions
concerning
clement
imagining
by
my
abrupt
answers
i
was
too
ill
to
she
says
you
will
heal
me
for
you
have
healed
miss
ashburn
how
ardently
she
loves
you
i
find
you
will
receive
this
letter
an
hour
before
we
wo
you
thank
and
praise
me
it
is
written
with
a
shaking
hand
and
throbbing
temples
i
know
it
would
be
difficult
to
keep
sibella
from
mounting
the
same
horse
if
she
were
informed
of
the
messenger
when
we
enter
the
chaise
i
will
tell
her
what
i
have
done
murden
letter
xxxi
from
the
same
to
the
same
why
should
i
have
the
rage
of
distraction
without
the
phrenzy
dare
they
tell
me
i
am
a
lunatic
she
is
gone
miss
ashburn
i
have
lost
your
treasure
some
villain
lured
by
the
vestiges
of
her
transcendent
beauty
has
taken
her
from
they
have
forced
me
into
a
bed
the
barbarians
confine
me
wo
you
order
me
to
be
released
oh
sweet
miss
ashburn
wo
you
tell
them
i
must
be
released
now
i
recollect
i
wanted
to
tell
you
all
the
ha
they
fade
from
me
and
i
dream
again
madam
i
keep
the
blue
boar
at
hipsley
and
the
poor
unhappy
gentleman
who
wrote
the
above
came
to
my
house
with
his
lady
yesterday
morning
as
long
as
ever
i
live
i
sha
forget
the
poor
gentleman
ravings
when
he
discovered
that
his
lady
had
ran
away
from
him
and
he
only
came
to
his
senses
about
an
hour
ago
when
he
ordered
us
to
send
for
you
and
he
wrote
till
his
raving
fit
returned
and
it
would
melt
your
heart
madam
to
hear
how
he
is
bemoaning
himself
and
calling
by
the
kindest
names
the
ungrateful
wicked
lady
who
served
him
so
i
saw
her
jump
into
the
chaise
myself
and
she
went
willingly
enough
though
he
wo
believe
it
my
son
brings
you
this
madam
and
i
hope
you
will
tell
us
what
we
must
do
for
the
poor
gentleman

your
ladyship

servant

these
lines
which
thy
friend
pens
to
thee
in
she
follows
on
the
instant

consolations
and
friendship
as
a
reparation
for
the
mischievous
error
into
which
i
had
led
will
you
receive
them
now

such
against
the
manifold
mischiefs
i
have
brought
upon
you
ah
what

i
to
do
with
secret
escapes
i
who
exclaimed
from
the
beginning
against
valmont
secresy
and
prophesied
its
fatal
consequences
must
i
too
conspire
to
make
sibella
the
victim
of
secresy
unhappy
sufferer
yet
more
unhappy
caroline
she
debarred
the
use
of
her
judgment
erred
only
from
mistake
i
alas
have
sinned
against
reason
and
conviction
clement
i
suspect

watched
our
footsteps
i
fear
he
has
secured
ah

fate

caroline
ashburn
letter
xxxiii
from
lord
filmar
to
sir
walter
boyer
i
can
truly
say
i
neither
sit
stand
walk
nor
lie
that
is
the
complete
body
and
soul
together
for
let
the
former
attempt
its
mechanical
motions
as
it
will
the
other
in
a
quite
opposite
direction
is
striking
curvetting
capering
twisting
tumbling
and
playing
more
tricks
than
any
fantastical
ape
in
nature
therefore
dear
walter
you
must
send
me
instantly
a
hundred
guineas
yes
really
if
you
want
to
quiet
my
conscience
you
must
send
me
a
hundred
guineas
nothing
will
quiet
my
conscience
but
matrimony
i
can
not
marry
without
a
hundred
ergo
if
you
do
send
me
a
hundred
guineas
and
i
should
die
and
be
the
sin
will
lay
at
your
door
and
you
will
die
and
be
likewise
as
i
have
much
consideration
for
you
my
dear
walter
and
as
i
know
that
people
who
have
very
weak
heads
have
sometimes
also
very
weak
nerves
i
would
advise
you
to
lay
down
my
letter
unless
you
are
seated
in
some
safe
place
for
should
your
situation
be
dangerous
and
should
the
surprise
i
am
preparing
for
you
rob
you
of
apprehension
down
you
drop
and
leave
me
in
utter
despair
lest
your
executors
should
refuse
me
the
hundred
guineas
well
are
you
settled
to
your
satisfaction
here
it
comes
like
a
thunderbolt
miss
valmont
is
mine
and
i
am
her
your
hundred
guineas
will
buy
a
parson
and
a
prayer
book
and
then
the
a
year
is
mine
also
you
know
dear
walter
that
resolved
to
obtain
the
heiress
of
valmont
castle
i
left
london
to
return
to
monkton
hall
with
a
heart
full
of
promise
and
a
head
full
of
stratagem
fortune
that
dear
blind
inconstant
goddess
who
formerly
was
almost
within
my
grasp
now
dashes
the
projects
of
others
to
the
ground
to
give
my
wishes
their
triumph
some
merlin
with
more
potent
spells
than
mine
broke
the
enchanted
castle
bore
off
the
damsel
and
directed
by
fate
and
fortune
brought
her
on
the
road
to
meet
me
to
the
very
spot
where
it
was
decreed
his
success
should
end
that
mine
might
begin
and
begun
it
has
last
night
i
slept
at
b
and
intended
breakfasting
with
sir
gilbert
monkton
this
morning
i
ordered
the
driver
to
leave
the
high
road
and
cross
the
country
by
which
means
i
should
save
six
miles
of
the
journey
griffiths
had
been
unwell
some
days
and
he
now
appeared
so
cold
and
so
much
indisposed
i
thought
it
prudent
to
give
him
a
breakfast
on
the
road
the
postilion
by
the
luckiest
of
all
chances
drove
up
to
a
pretty
little
inn
that
i
shall
love
dearly
for
six
months
to
come
the
landlady
a
curtsying
civil
woman
was
mighty
sorry
she
had
not
a
better
room
to
receive
my
honour
in
but
her
best
parlour
she
said
was
already
taken
up
with
a
lady
and
gentleman
who
had
arrived
at
seven
in
the
morning
and
she
showed
me
into
a
little
place
which
had
two
excellent
properties
namely
perfect
cleanliness
and
a
good
fire
by
this
good
fire
i
had
sat
five
or
perhaps
ten
minutes
when
griffiths
entered
lord
my
lord
said
he
and
turned
back
to
shut
the
door
have
seen
the
strangest
sight
my
lord
i
have
seen
a
gentleman
at
that
moment
a
was
brought
into
the
room
and
griffiths
grew
downright
pettish
with
the
damsel
who
bore
the
kettle
because
she
did
not
quit
the
room
with
sufficient
speed
his
information
walter
amounted
to
thus
much
that
in
the
passage
he
had
seen
the
gentleman
who
occupied
the
best
parlour
and
that
this
gentleman
of
whom
griffiths
had
had
a
very
distinct
view
certainly
was
or
griffiths
was
much
deceived
the
very
identical
spright
who
reminded
some
of
us
of
our
devotions
in
the
narrow
passage
of
the
west
tower
at
valmont
castle
impossible
said
i
lord
is
true
said
griffiths
i
should
know
him
among
a
thousand
i
know
his
eyes
and
nose
as
well
as
i
know
your
my
lord
this
you
will
allow
walter
was
but
a
very
vague
sort
of
a
supposition
to
ground
any
belief
upon
for
as
eyes
and
noses
are
the
common
lot
of
all
mankind
it
may
happen
now
and
then
that
two
or
more
may
be
greatly
alike
yet
so
diligent
is
hope
and
imagination
i
could
not
persuade
myself
these
eyes
and
this
nose
had
any
owner
but
the
spright
of
the
it
was
miss
valmont
and
her
hermit
my
fancy
said
i
blessed
my
stars
i
cursed
my
stars
i
wondered
how
and
why
they
should
come
hither
then
i
remembered
that
fancy
though
sometimes
a
prophetess
is
rarely
an
oracle
and
i
thought
it
might
not
be
miss
valmont
and
her
i
consulted
much
with
griffiths
and
at
length
had
recourse
to
the
waiter
a
dapper
fellow
with
a
wooden
leg
they
came
he
said
on
horseback
before
seven
a
man
who
conducted
them
did
not
alight
they
were
impatient
to
be
gone
they
waited
for
a
chaise
they
had
ordered
a
breakfast
which
neither
of
them
had
tasted
the
lady
did
not
appear
he
thought
equipped
for
travelling
the
gentleman
was
melancholy
and
the
lady
restless
and
agitated
miss
valmont
whispered
i
to
myself
are
a
fine
couple
said
the
waiter
i
asked
if
he
thought
they
were
a
married
pair
he
answered
he
was
sure
she
must
be
a
married
lady
i
enquired
if
the
gentleman
seemed
to
be
very
fond
of
her
at
all
replied
the
waiter
gentleman
sits
writing
sir
with
his
back
to
her
she
walks
about
the
room
muttering
to
herself
when
i
carried
in
the
breakfast
he
leaned
his
head
against
the
wall
and
groaned
with
his
eyes
shut
it
can
not
be
miss
valmont
and
her
hermit
thought
i
the
lady
handsome
i
asked
the
waiter
thought
she
was
too
pale
to
be
very
handsome
but
he
added
that
in
all
his
born
days
he
never
beheld
such
a
head
of
hair
what
colour
is
it
i
asked
it
was
neither
black
nor
brown
nor
as
red
as
jenny
he
thought
it
was
not
any
colour
but
it
shone
as
if
gold
threads
were
among
it
miss
valmont
whispered
my
forward
heart
i
rose
and
walked
hastily
across
the
room
did
they
talk
about
said
i
do
talk
at
all
sir
the
poor
gentleman
seems
very
bad
and
as
i
told
your
honor
before
she
walks
about
muttering
when
they
first
came
as
i
was
lighting
a
fire
for
them
the
lady
pulled
off
her
hat
just
as
if
she
was
in
a
passion
and
then
she
shook
her
fine
waving
locks
as
though
she
was
proud
of
them
and
she
said
her
head
ached
with
that
cumbrance
and
she
said
something
more
about
customs
and
cumbrances
but
i
forget
what
your
honor
while
she
talked
the
gentleman
looked
so
kind
and
pretty
at
her
it
did
my
heart
good
to
see
him
but
he
is
either
very
ill
or
very
whimmy
for
immediately
while
she
took
off
her
cloak
he
laid
his
head
on
the
table
with
his
face
downward
and
sighed
as
if
his
heart
was
breaking
i
asked
if
he
had
heard
her
call
him
by
any
name
and
the
waiter
replied
he
had
heard
her
twice
name
somebody
as
she
walked
about
the
room
but
to
my
great
disappointment
at
that
moment
his
memory
had
not
retained
the
name
at
this
part
of
our
conference
the
parlour
bell
rang
and
the
waiter
disappeared
not
though
till
i
had
sealed
him
mine
by
a
bribe
and
given
him
orders
to
return
instantly
however
griffiths
who
was
most
zealous
on
this
occasion
thought
proper
to
follow
him
fortunate
was
it
that
he
did
for
my
waiter
dull
at
a
hint
had
received
a
letter
from
the
guest
in
the
parlour
which
without
consulting
my
will
and
pleasure
he
was
quietly
bearing
to
a
courier
ready
mounted
and
waiting
for
it
at
the
inn
door
griffiths
with
a
careless
air
took
the
letter
from
his
hand
it
was
addressed
walter
to
i
began
to
stalk
to
exclaim
to
ejaculate
go
on
filmar
cried
i
and
prosper
henceforward
be
plot
and
stratagem
sanctified
for
miss
ashburn
deigns
to
plot
griffiths
prudently
reminded
me
that
it
would
be
quite
as
well
at
present
to
think
of
miss
valmont
and
leave
miss
ashburn
alone
till
another
opportunity
said
i
folly
is
madness
but
to
think
for
a
moment
of
such
a
project
said
i
ten
minutes
after
and
turning
myself
half
round
in
my
chair
throwing
one
arm
across
its
back
and
one
leg
over
the
other
no
no
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
i
fell
to
shaking
the
uppermost
leg
furiously
might
be
very
easily
managed
though
said
griffiths
then
your
lordship
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
digest
montgomery
bullets
and
miss
ashburn
harder
oh
that
miss
ashburn
can
find
words
to
lash
like
scorpion
stings
say
no
more
of
it
griffiths
i
have
given
her
up
you
please
my
lord
ay
muttered
i
to
myself
her
go
to
her
montgomery
there
are
men
who
perhaps
are
worthy
of
being
loved
as
himself
and
might
perhaps
be
more
capable
of
constancy
there
are
other
women
too
in
the
world
thank
heaven
strange
continued
i
miss
ashburn
with
her
understanding
and
who
must
know
the
imbecility
of
montgomery
love
could
dream
of
joining
in
any
plot
whose
object
was
to
bear
miss
valmont
to
montgomery
for
walter
i
had
by
this
time
concluded
that
the
quondam
hermit
was
some
righteous
of
miss
valmont
and
her
lover
and
i
felt
inclined
to
be
mortally
offended
with
her
because
montgomery
had
so
well
concealed
from
my
penetration
their
mutual
intelligence
i
shifted
to
the
other
side
of
my
seat
and
i
did
not
sigh
but
i
blew
my
breath
from
me
with
much
more
force
than
usual
i
mused
during
the
greater
part
of
an
hour
chaise
is
waiting
my
lord
said
griffiths
as
you
have
quite
done
with
this
affair
if
your
lordship
thinks
proper
it
is
as
well
not
to
keep
the
horses
in
the
well
i
must
say
was
a
fine
opportunity
you
think
so
griffiths
said
i
mildly
the
rogue
exultingly
smiled
and
to
change
my
wavering
into
downright
resolution
he
recapitulated
all
the
probabilities
that
awaited
my
attempt
and
noticed
the
trifling
hazard
that
would
accrue
provided
i
adopted
his
plan
for
the
purpose
should
the
attempt
fail
nor
did
he
forget
an
oblique
glance
or
two
at
certain
prospects
which
he
knew
put
no
inconsiderable
weight
into
the
balance
away
i
cried
the
driver
his
directions
let
him
draw
up
close
to
the
door
before
the
other
chaise
and
let
him
be
sure
to
keep
his
chaise
door
open
but
not
the
step
down
signifies
it
to
thee
walter
of
what
griffiths
plan
consisted
surely
not
nothing
could
be
more
easy
than
at
the
instant
of
their
departure
to
request
a
moment
conversation
with
the
gentleman
nothing
more
simple
than
to
invent
a
tale
of
a
pursuit
to
be
delivered
into
the
attentive
ear
of
miss
valmont
guide
nothing
could
promise
fairer
and
surely
never
did
fulment
better
follow
promise
our
casement
looked
upon
a
garden
and
there
the
melancholy
conductor
of
miss
valmont
came
to
walk
for
a
few
minutes
there
needed
no
screen
to
hide
us
from
his
glance
his
arms
were
folded
and
his
eyes
intensely
fixed
on
the
earth
his
hat
shaded
the
upper
part
of
his
face
so
that
i
could
see
no
part
of
his
said
resemblance
to
the
bearded
youth
of
the
armoury
but
i
observed
with
pleasure
and
thrilling
expectation
that
he
and
i
were
nearly
of
one
stature
both
booted
and
both
wearing
dark
blue
great
coats
this
only
difference
existed
one
of
his
capes
he
had
drawn
round
his
chin
all
mine
lay
on
my
walter
i
could
button
mine
up
on
occasion
george
had
ridden
my
grey
mare
from
town
i
felt
no
way
inclined
to
make
him
a
party
in
the
transaction
and
i
also
wanted
the
mare
for
griffiths
i
therefore
ordered
him
to
return
to
b
and
take
a
stage
for
london
waiting
there
my
further
orders
griffiths
saw
him
mount
a
post
horse
and
led
the
grey
mare
round
the
house
and
fastened
her
to
some
rails
in
readiness
it
was
exactly
two
hours
and
one
quarter
from
the
time
of
our
arrival
before
their
chaise
came
to
the
door
the
horses
were
to
have
a
feed
in
their
harness
the
guests
were
impatient
to
be
gone
i
shuddered
and
as
i
traversed
our
little
room
the
echo
of
my
footsteps
seemed
to
be
blabbing
tell
tales
i
shall
never
walter
know
such
another
minute
as
that
all
in
future
will
be
the
dull
uniformity
of
peace
and
plenty
it
was
done
the
waiter
delivered
griffiths
message
in
the
best
parlour
i
from
a
distant
peeping
station
saw
the
gentleman
walk
to
our
room
i
heard
the
door
shut
the
waiter
stump
away
thrilling
throbbing
with
hope
and
fear
i
walked
up
the
passage
to
their
parlour
wrapped
in
her
cloak
the
hood
drawn
over
her
head
her
hat
in
her
hand
stood
the
fair
expectant
come
said
she
let
us
hasten
the
day
was
gloomy
the
passage
was
dark
i
had
drawn
up
my
cape
and
drawn
down
my
hat
my
hand
took
her
she
tripped
along
no
creature
was
in
sight
i
caught
her
up
in
my
arms
lifted
her
into
the
chaise
and
we
whirled
off
just
as
the
landlady
came
bustling
up
to
the
door
i
had
my
cue
of
silence
and
reserve
in
the
intelligence
i
had
received
from
the
waiter
during
the
first
three
miles
i
neither
spoke
nor
looked
up
she
the
while
clasping
her
hands
and
as
the
waiter
called
it
i
heard
her
pronounce
the
names
of
miss
ashburn
of
montgomery
and
of
some
one
else
for
three
miles
i
say
we
interchanged
not
one
word
then
walter
the
first
word
betrayed
me
and
now
what
a
list
of
sobs
tears
screams
prayers
and
lamentations
you
expect
i
have
not
one
for
you
she
sighed
indeed
and
a
few
drops
forced
a
reluctant
way
but
she
neither
prayed
threatened
nor
lamented
she
demanded
her
liberty
she
reasoned
for
her
liberty
reasoned
with
a
firmness
collected
vigilant
manly
let
me
say
she
remembers
seeing
me
in
the
castle
and
takes
me
for
her
uncle
agent
in
truth
walter
i
suffer
her
to
think
it
still
for
i
do
not
find
when
carefully
examined
that
my
own
character
and
motives
in
this
business
possess
much
to
recommend
them
in
a
little
glen
between
two
hills
of
which
the
barrenness
of
one
frowns
on
the
cultivation
of
the
other
stands
a
farm
embosomed
hid
in
secresy
and
solitude
no
traveller

the
distant
heath
no
horses

its
own

the
print
of
their
hoofs
at
its
entrance
but
even
more
than
usual
gloom
and
dulness
now
reigns
around
it
the
lively
whistle
of
the
ploughman
and
hind
no
longer
chear
the
echoes
of
the
hill
the
farm
yard

emptied
of
its
gabbling
tenants

fit
employment
for
my
time
to
relate
nor
for
your
to
read
the
trifling
adventures
by
which
griffiths
became
acquainted
with
this
fair
daughter
her
circumstances
and
abode
nor
how

wooed
and
won
her
love

three
leagues
distant

scarcely
four
from

a
less
ready
imagination
than
even
thine
walter
might
picture
to
itself
the
manner
in
which
griffiths
deluded
miss
with
a
tale
of
pursuit
and
discovery
the
youth
checked
his
surprise
and
renewed
his
vigour
he
hastened
to
secure
his
lovely
ward

griffiths
mean
while
stole
round
the
inn
mounted
the
grey
mare
and
was
out
of
sight
and
sound
of
the
consequences
i
hear
her
walking

slight
partition

her
chamber
from
mine
no
more
of
those
sighs
my
fair
one
i
thank
heaven
i
am
not
an
agent
of
valmont
neither
he
must
have
used
her
cruelly
she
is
excessively
pale
and
strangely
altered

watchful
sentinel

i

not
to
enter

enterprise

all
the
saucy
gaiety

youth
and
untamed
spirits
could
impart
nay
when
i
began
to
write
this
letter

wore
their
natural

letter
xxxiv
from
caroline
ashburn
to
lady
barlowe
dear
madam
by
a
strange
concurrence
of
accidents
i
am
at
present
attending
murden
who
during
many
days
has
lain
dangerously
ill
in
a
small
country
inn
nine
miles
from
valmont
castle
i
must
leave
it
to
your
prudence
to
acquaint
sir
thomas
barlowe
to
whom
i
know
it
will
be
most
distressing
tidings
that
his
nephew
is
in
danger
but
it
is
necessary
that
sir
thomas
should
know
it
immediately
for
i
have
made
preparations
for
bringing
murden
to
london
that
he
may
have
better
accommodation
and
better
advice
though
i
speak
of
advice
i
dare
not
encourage
any
hope
in
sir
thomas
for
i
have
watched
the
progress
of
his
nephew
disorder
and
i
believe
he
is
only
lingering
abide
he
can
not
sir
thomas
barlowe
loved
this
young
man
as
a
son
and
to
receive
him
scarcely
a
shadow
of
his
former
self
will
create
distressing
emotions
yet
i
beseech
you
to
urge
sir
thomas
carefully
to
avoid
any
strong
expressions
of
sorrow
when
his
nephew
arrives
for
i
have
the
grief
to
tell
you
that
murden
reason
is
shaken
and
dreadful
paroxysms
may
follow
the
slightest
agitation
nought
but
the
power
i
have
long
laboured
to
obtain
and
have
in
part
obtained
over
my
sensations
could
have
preserved
any
degree
of
fortitude
in
me
under
the
most
trying
events
of
my
life
events
which
have
lately
befallen
miss
valmont
and
murden
on
them
i
had
bestowed
the
warmest
tribute
of
my
affections
in
the
enjoyment
of
their
virtues
and
happiness
i
expected
daily
to
augment
my
own
but
alas
it
is
gone
and
my
wretched
hopes
still
wear
their
beautiful
and
alluring
form
while
sinking
in
disappointment
i
am
aware
madam
that
murden
misfortune
can
not
create
more
concern
in
your
breast
than
the
circumstance
of
my
being
with
him
will
raise
wonder
and
curiosity
nor
have
i
any
other
than
a
full
intention
of
making
you
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
that
drew
us
both
hither
whose
sad
termination
has
operated
so
fatally
on
murden
but
i
am
obliged
to
defer
the
relation
till
our
arrival
in
town
both
on
account
of
its
length
of
the
preparations
i
am
making
for
ease
and
safety
on
the
journey
and
the
continual
anxiety
of
watchfulness
which
possesses
me
for
the
sake
of
miss
valmont
to
whom
i
have
been
unhappily
the
cause
of
evils
possibly
worse
than
that
which
has
befallen
murden
i
can
not
name
the
day
when
you
and
sir
thomas
may
expect
us
for
the
time
consumed
in
the
journey
must
be
regulated
by
the
abatement
or
increase
of
murden
disorder
he
shall
travel
in
a
litter
and
i
hope
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
assure
sir
thomas
nothing
shall
be
wanting
to
his
accommodation
that
i
have
means
to
procure

letter
xxxv
from
caroline
ashburn
to
george
valmont
sir
by
the
messenger
of
mine
who
on
his
search
for
my
lost
friend
came
to
your
gates
a
few
days
since
you
were
informed
that
it
was
through
my
means
sibella
escaped
from
your
castle
and
however
stern
may
be
the
anger
you
entertain
against
me
be
assured
sir
it
can
not
exceed
the
vehemence
of
that
and
sorrow
which
now
assail
me
for
having
been
the
contriver
of
so
unjustifiable
an
undertaking
i
send
you
sir
a
pacquet
containing
all
the
letters
i
have
received
from
sibella
and
also
the
letters
that
have
passed
between
murden
and
myself
i
lay
them
before
you
with
the
confidence
that
you
will
afford
them
a
patient
and
temperate
perusal
for
i
think
they
will
serve
to
convince
you
as
they
have
already
convinced
me
by
the
unfortunate
event
to
which
they
have
led
that
however
plausible
and
even
necessary
in
appearance
yet
artifice
and
secresy
are
dangerous
vicious
tools
your
secrets
were
the
preparatory
step
to
the
errors
of
clement
and
sibella
had
sibella
never
departed
from
strict
truth
and
sincerity
she
had
never
formed
her
rash
engagement
with
clement
had
murden
never
with
his
dangerous
refinements
of
fancy
longed
secretly
to
view
this
rare
child
of
seclusion
he
had
not
battered
his
life
and
happiness
for
a
sigh
and
lastly
had
i
not
given
way
to
the
fatal
mistake
that
secresy
could
repair
the
inability
of
reason
i
had
instead
of
availing
myself
of
the
ruin
on
the
rock
ere
now
perhaps
released
sibella
by
convincing
you
and
we
had
all
been

happy
murden
unfinished
letter
from
the
village
of
hipsley
will
show
you
his
deplorable
situation
and
all
that
we
know
concerning
the
loss
of
our
sibella
i
have
six
agents
employed
to
discover
her
but
they
wander
blindly
for
i
have
neither
trace
nor
supposition
to
guide
them
what
can
i
do
sir
if
you
have
any
advice
to
offer
i
hope
you
will
not
withhold
it
from
animosity
to
me
excessively
do
i
love
the
friend
i
have
helped
to
sacrifice
yet
i
can
readily
and
sincerely
forgive
you
the
errors
of
your
conduct
towards
her
oh
then
sir
pardon
mine
and
in
pity
to
the
anxiety
of
my
heart
aid
me
with
your
advice
and
assistance
i
do
not
even
hate
montgomery
though
i
do
despise
him
altogether
you
suspected
him
of
taking
sibella
from
the
castle
i
suspected
him
of
stealing
her
from
murden
he
was
otherwise
employed
i
arrived
in
town
with
my
poor
patient
under
my
protection
yesterday
evening
and
resigned
murden
to
the
care
of
his
uncle
sir
thomas
barlowe
when
i
drove
up
to
my
mother
door
i
found
it
more
than
usually
crowded
with
carriages
and
servants
hung
upon
the
pillars
and
when
several
of
my
mother
footmen
stepped
from
among
the
crowd
i
perceived
they
were
in
new
liveries
adorned
in
the
highest
stile
of
elegant
expence
though
it
was
impossible
not
to
notice
the
uncommon
glare
of
splendor
that
saluted
my
eyes
yet
our
changes
have
always
been
so
various
and
profuse
i
never
thought
of
enquiring
into
the
cause
of
the
present
unfitted
by
my
dress
but
still
more
by
weariness
of
limbs
and
depression
of
mind
to
encounter
company
i
retired
to
my
chamber
and
to
bed
this
morning
my
maid
attended
me
and
with
the
natural
hesitation
of
good
nature
in
relating
disagreeable
tidings
she
informed
me
montgomery
was
married
to
my
mother
sir
it
is
the
fact
last
saturday
my
mother
became
the
bride
of
your
son
and
the
parade
i
witnessed
last
night
was
to
do
honour
to
the
first
complimentors
of
this
extraordinary
hymeneal
the
tidings
stunned
me
for
i
was
no
way
prepared
from
the
conduct
of
either
to
expect
such
an
event
uninvited
and
assuredly
unwelcome
i
visited
their
apartment
the
hour
of
breakfast
and
my
mother
collected
the
utmost
of
her
haughtiness
and
montgomery
his
gay
indifference
to
repel
the
reproaches
they
expected
i
should
be
prompted
to
bestow
on
them
but
sir
they
mistook
me
i
went
only
to
deliver
to
them
a
plain
history
of
the
mischiefs
i
have
heaped
on
murden
and
my
sibella
to
remind
them
how
early
and
alas
how
severe
a
punishment
has
followed
my
deviation
from
rectitude
i
saw
montgomery
countenance
become
pale
and
ghastly
it
was
sir
when
i
spoke
of
miss
valmont
independent
fortune
then
i
believe
all
the
force
of
his
situation
was
present
with
him
may
it
often
recur
and
be
the
preservative
against
future
follies
allow
me
sir
to
say
a
word
or
two
of
him
who
most
loved
your
niece
and
best
deserved
her
murden
intruded
on
your
domain
and
destroyed
some
of
your
unripe
projects
yet
i
persuade
myself
you
will
feel
a
pity
for
his
misfortunes
his
life
pays
the
forfeiture
of
his
curiosity
and
secresy
a
romantic
love
of
miss
valmont
sapped
its
foundation
and
his
nights
of
watching
amidst
the
chilling
damps
of
the
ruin
hastened
the
progress
of
its
destruction
sibella
unaccountable
escape
from
him
at
a
time
when
his
high
toned
feelings
were
wrought
upon
in
a
way
that
i
can
not
express
by
the
in
her
person
drove
him
to
madness
then
it
was
that
i
saw
him
who
once
possessed
every
advantage
of
manly
grace
and
beauty
changed
to
a
living
skeleton
whose
eyes
starting
from
their
sockets
glanced
around
with
wild
horror
and
insanity
oh
sir
it
was
indeed
a
scene
that
called
forth
all
my
fortitude
as
his
delirium
had
no
mischievous
tendencies
it
was
judged
better
to
remove
him
to
london
and
whether
change
of
air
and
place
had
the
salutary
effect
or
the
delirium
had
exhausted
its
force
i
know
not
but
he
became
perfectly
restored
to
reason
before
we
reached
london
that
restoration
was
almost
beyond
my
hopes
and
there
hope
rests
it
dares
not
presume
further
the
most
certain
indications
of
speedy
dissolution
now
appear
and
all
my
time
must
be
given
to
the
endeavour
of
tracing
my
beloved
sibella
and
consoling
the
anxious
murden
for
her
loss
on
his
own
account
consolation
pains
him
all
his
wishes
centre
in
death
and
the
irrevocable
union
will
soon
take
place
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
inform
me
of
the
name
of
sibella
other
guardian
adieu
sir
may
that
peace
which
is
only
to
be
purchased
by
rectitude
become
an
inmate
of
your
abode
caroline
ashburn
letter
xxxvi
lord
filmar
to
sir
walter
boyer
faith
walter
i
have
secured
a
rich
prize
indeed
hear
but
its
estimate
in
the
first
place
a
very
lovely
and
adorable
woman
in
the
second
a
fine
estate
in
the
third
an
heir
in
embrio
to
inherit
it
true
by
the
gods
nevertheless
stop
your
rash
conclusions
for
i
have
heard
her
whole
story
therefore
i
tell
you
that
miss
ashburn
is
an
angel
murden
a
fine
fellow
valmont
an
idiot
sibella
a
saint
and
montgomery
a
scoundrel
though
on
my
soul
she
talked
so
movingly
of
his
fading
i
could
not
for
my
life
persuade
myself
to
tell
her
my
true
opinion
of
him
from
the
little
she
knows
of
murden
her
hermit
and
deliverer
i
long
to
know
more
i
burn
to
tell
you
of
her
wonderful
escape
of
the
marvellous
ruin
on
the
rock
but
i
have
resolved
to
wave
explanations
till
i
i
charge
you
by
your
friendship
breathe
not
a
whisper
of
the
adventure
till
you
see
me
i
am
going
to
restore
her
to
her
friends
her
eloquence
did
part
but
truly
her
condition
did
i
never
bargained
to
pay
off
such
a
mortgage
i
could
love
her
dearly
but
then
you
know
my
name
is
filmar
and
as
a
lord
i
am
bound
in
duty
to
love
and
cherish
no
son
but
a
son
of
my
own
begetting
i
have
dispatched
two
messengers
one
for
carriages
and
another
to
that
inn
at
hipsley
i
do
love
at
all
to
make
enquiries
after
murden
i
wonder
how
he
and
i
shall
adjust
our
i
fear
there
is
a
long
balance
in
his
favour
you
perceive
walter
all
my
secret
plottings
and
contrivings
have
brought
me
to
a
fine
heritage
at
last
murden
can
not
call
me
any
thing
less
than
a
and
will
say
i
deserve
a
thief
punishment
valmont
too
will
want
a
peck
at
me
neither
for
the
credit
of
love
nor
integrity
but
only
because
sibella
is
the
great
great
great
granddaughter
of
some
one
or
other
of
his
grandfather
montgomery
may
pretend
the
honour
of
her
own
phrase
impeached
by
her
residence
with
me
and
if
he
wo
believe
that
until
two
hours
since
i
never
forced
myself
into
her
presence
why
i
shall
be
obliged
by
all
the
laws
of
honour
and
gentlemanship
to
prove
it
by
the
length
of
a
sword
heigh
ho
and
this
pretty
mortal
has
actually
prevailed
on
me
to
endure
the
brunt
and
carry
her
back
to
miss
ashburn
she
has
offered
high
bribes
solid
comforts
made
up
of
duty
and
justice
but
i
have
a
sickly
palate
spoiled
by
other
viands
i
want
a
modern
seasoned
fricassee
alas
i
have
no
alternative
unless
i
shoot
her
and
bury
her
under
a
tree
i
do
know
what
of
that
sort
i
may
be
tempted
to
for
myself
for
when
i
have
no
longer
her
and
her
concerns
to
think
of
i
must
turn
to
my
own
a
pretty
prospect
do
you
know
walter
any
way
that
a
lord
turned
plain
man
can
get
a
living
for
unless
i
heaven
knows
i
must
go
without
it
you
are
admiring
my
forbearance
in
keeping
such
a
distance
walter
but
the
fact
is
i
was
a
coward
daily
almost
hourly
miss
valmont
intreated
she
might
speak
with
me
and
i
as
constantly
with
a
great
many
civil
excuses
declined
the
conversation
what
could
i
have
said
but
what
had
amounted
to
this
valmont
i
ran
away
with
you
because
i
wanted
your
estate
for
want
of
a
as
to
yourself
i
know
nothing
about
you
therefore
how
can
i
care
for
you
methought
walter
when
i
had
your
cash
in
hand
i
should
be
bold
your
cash
came
i
pocketed
it
and
i
proudly
strutted
up
to
miss
the
former
pages
will
tell
you
the
result
the
plot
thickens
and
i
am
more
of
montgomery
sort
than
i
believed
i
mr
murden
is
good
god
walter
who
would
have
thought
on
this
they
told
my
messenger
that
he
has
been
raving
mad
and
that
a
lady
took
him
away
for
london
yesterday
i
dare
not
relate
to
miss
valmont
these
cursed
i
am
impatient
to
yield
her
we
shall
travel
as
fast
as
i
think
her
condition
may
allow
without
danger
filmar
letter
xxxvii
from
george
valmont
to
caroline
ashburn
madam
i
am
certainly
obliged
to
you
for
your
intentions
and
though
i
allow
you
have
sometimes
reason
on
your
side
i
think
you
make
too
little
allowance
for
the
proper
obedience
due
from
children
to
parents
as
a
parent
i
certainly
stood
both
to
clement
and
sibella
and
they
ought
implicitly
to
have
obeyed
my
commands
however
she
poor
child
suffers
sufficiently
and
i
am
willing
to
forgive
though
i
can
never
be
reconciled
to
her
her
pregnancy
will
now
be
known
to
the
world
and
were
i
again
to
receive
her
i
should
in
disgracing
my
family
i
heartily
wish
your
search
may
be
successful
and
i
am
ready
to
reimburse
your
expences
and
also
if
you
find
my
niece
to
allow
her
a
proper
establishment
my
lord
of
elsings
joint
guardian
with
me
in
the
trust
of
miss
valmont
resides
at
present
in
this
neighbourhood
i
have
had
an
interview
with
him
on
the
business
but
i
do
not
discover
that
either
himself
or
any
one
related
to
him
is
any
way
concerned
in
taking
sibella
will
you
take
the
trouble
in
my
name
to
wish
clement
montgomery
all
the
he
may
expect
to
find
in
his
union
with
old
age
folly
and
affectation
madam
your
very
obedient
servant
valmont
letter
xxxviii
from
lord
filmar
to
sir
walter
boyer
your
pardon
walter
that
i
should
pass
your
lodgings
as
i
drove
out
of
town
without
stopping
to
say
a
single
but
let
pity
and
humanity
plead
their
cause
with
ever
so
much
eloquence
yet
the
prejudices
of
custom
are
so
potent
that
a
man
becomes
ashamed
if
his
eyes
give
their
tribute
to
the
feelings
of
his
heart
truly
walter
i
should
have
blushed
at
my
insensibility
if
i
had
not
wept
yesterday
yet
for
weeping
i
drew
up
the
blinds
of
my
chaise
and
to
hide
myself
from
the
finger
of
scorn
bade
the
driver
carry
me
with
all
expedition
to
my
aunt
retreat
at
hayley
lodge
i
must
suppose
for
your
own
sake
boyer
that
when
you
wrote
me
your
hasty
letter
to
the
farm
you
were
uninformed
of
montgomery
marriage
with
ashburn
haste
could
not
excuse
such
an
as
little
as
you
knew
of
miss
valmont
no
no
it
was
not
possible
you
could
be
informed
of
it
and
not
send
me
the
tidings
i
am
an
ass
i
have
not
the
common
discernment
of
a
school
boy
or
i
had
never
talked
of
accommodating
her
condition
by
tardy
travelling
when
i
was
bearing
miss
valmont
to
her
beloved
though
perfidious
clement
speed
flying
speed
was
alone
necessary
to
her
safety
i
spared
neither
money
nor
command
yet
to
her
foundered
not
that
she
complained
never
she
even
thanked
my
zeal
when
her
gasping
sensations
would
give
way
to
utterance
but
i
saw
it
walter
in
her
eyes
i
saw
the
speed
of
her
affections
in
the
convulsive
swells
of
her
bosom
do
not
call
me
ridiculous
but
upon
my
soul
there
were
moments
of
the
journey
that
while
gazing
on
her
i
was
on
the
point
of
grasping
her
in
my
arms
lest
her
very
form
should
dissolve
into
feeling
and
vanish
from
my
protection
once
i
refused
to
proceed
unless
she
would
take
refreshment
she
did
not
plead
and
taking
from
me
a
cup
of
chocolate
her
shaking
hand
raised
it
half
way
to
her
lips
then
returned
it
untasted
to
the
table
i
drew
a
chair
and
deliberately
seated
myself
as
if
resolved
to
put
my
threat
in
practice
after
a
short
silence
said
she
you
ever
known
what
it
is
to
love
i
was
looking
on
the
fire
and
recollecting
some
odd
sensations
that
had
occasionally
crept
to
my
heart
was
about
to
reply
in
the
affirmative
but
turning
my
head
and
meeting
the
full
gaze
of
her
eloquent
eye
an
honest
and
prompt
reply
sprang
to
my
lips
my
soul
and
salvation
never
madam
griffiths
see
the
horses
instantly
put
to
the
chaise
we
alight
no
more
till
we
alight
in
london
montgomery
showed
you
a
silly
portrait
that
he
painted
to
say
it
was
the
likeness
of
miss
valmont
was
a
falsehood
was
a
mere
passive
representation
of
fine
features
let
him
paint
me
their
energy
their
force
the
fulness
of
hope
that
beamed
from
them
yesterday
morning
and
i
will
say
he
is
worthy
of
miss
valmont
love
he
can
not
do
it
walter
he
could
as
soon
be
a
god
she
never
was
beautiful
till
then
not
in
the
fullest
bloom
of
her
vigour
and
prosperity
did
she
ever
equal
herself
such
as
i
saw
her
yesterday
morning
madam
is
miss
ashburn
residence
i
said
as
we
drove
to
the
door
shall
see
my
caroline
first
then
said
miss
valmont
my
clement
agitated
as
i
was
at
the
time
by
her
impatience
and
expectations
i
can
not
suppose
i
enquired
for
any
one
else
than
miss
ashburn
whether
the
servant
imagined
she
was
of
the
party
or
concluded
my
visit
must
be
to
his
mistress
i
know
not
but
he
announced
lord
filmar
in
the
drawing
room
and
i
led
in
the
loveliest
spectre
with
golden
threaded
hair
to
an
apartment
where
montgomery
lolled
negligently
on
one
sopha
and
his
portly
bride
on
another
shall
i
tell
you
how
they
looked
no
for
their
best
looks
are
worthless
but
i
will
tell
you
that
miss
valmont
looked
ardor
love
and
she
raised
her
clasped
hands
one
instant
then
rushed
into
the
arms
of
montgomery
which
involuntarily
opened
to
receive
and
were
compelled
to
sustain
her
a
confused
suspicion
of
something
more
than
usually
wrong
in
montgomery
darted
upon
my
mind
i
looked
wistfully
around
the
apartment
as
it
were
for
a
relief
from
danger
and
my
heart
bounded
as
i
saw
miss
ashburn
enter
the
charming
woman
she
could
make
astonishment
yield
to
better
feelings
with
admirable
presence
of
mind
she
instantly
approached
miss
valmont
saying
dearest
sibella
have
you
no
tokens
for
your
caroline
yes
replied
miss
valmont
many
love
and
gratitude
also
for
my
caroline
happy
happy
world
i
will
live
with
you
in
it
for
ever
miss
ashburn
endeavoured
to
retain
sibella
in
her
embrace
and
began
hurryingly
to
enquire
of
her
where
she
had
been
and
by
what
means
she
had
got
hither
but
miss
valmont
knew
nothing
of
the
past
she
was
alive
only
to
the
present
to
her
own
anticipation
of
the
future
she
turned
back
to
him
say
for
ever
clement
she
would
have
given
herself
a
second
time
to
his
arms
but
an
averted
look
and
staggering
retreat
forbad
her
good
god
walter
methinks
i
see
her
now
never
shall
i
cease
to
remember
the
changes
of
her
countenance
from
rapture
to
astonishment
from
dumb
astonishment
to
doubt
and
from
doubt
the
quick
transition
to
despair
thus
spoke
to
her
the
hesitating
cold
blooded
villain
valmont
you
have
used
me
very
ill
once
i
i
could
have
it
was
barbarous
of
you
who
knew
your
uncle
severe
disposition
a
little
longer
concealment
might
he
paused
miss
ashburn
tears
began
to
flow
for
her
friend
who
showed
no
symptom
of
common
sorrow
miss
ashburn
endeavoured
to
take
her
hands
but
sibella
shrunk
as
if
the
kind
emotions
of
her
nature
were
congealed
a
tear
that
had
lingered
on
her
cheek
the
last
of
her
tears
of
happiness
died
away
her
asking
eye
still
fixed
itself
on
montgomery
nor
could
he
forbear
answering
to
it
know
miss
valmont
me
listen
only
to
me
exclaimed
miss
ashburn
sibella
pushed
her
firmly
aside
and
bent
forward
to
him
would
miss
valmont
he
in
the
same
irresolute
cowardly
cruel
tone
should
be
glad
to
serve
it
will
be
best
that
you
return
to
your
uncle
it
might
have
been
otherwise
but
you
were
always
rash
and
this
is
not
time
for
explanations
i
am
sorry
but
i
can
not
now
give
you
any
protection
for
i
i
am
indeed
yes
madam
i
am
married
we
not
both
married
said
she
with
an
emphasis
that
thrilled
is
this
speak
clement
now
miss
valmont
you
are
childish
said
ashburn
coldly
montgomery
bride
i
mean
man
of
taste
marries
a
woman
after
an
affair
with
her
can
bear
this
no
longer
cried
miss
ashburn
madam
sibella
dear
sibella
turn
your
eyes
on
me
let
not
their
pure
rays
beam
on
a
wretch
so
worthless
devoured
by
emotions
over
which
friendship
had
no
control
she
was
still
deaf
to
miss
ashburn
still
those
pure
eyes
bent
their
gaze
on
montgomery
who
now
trembled
who
now
could
not
ever
articulate
his
broken
sentences
who
fainting
with
guilt
supported
himself
by
leaning
on
the
back
of
that
couch
on
which
he
had
so
lately
reclined
in
the
ease
of
his
basely
purchased
triumph
suddenly
starting
from
this
posture
he
rushed
towards
the
door
whither
clement
exclaimed
miss
valmont
you
take
me
with
you
clement
and
while
without
daring
to
look
on
her
he
disengaged
his
hand
which
she
had
seized
she
rapidly
uttered
in
a
softened
tone
of
voice
lover
husband
all
the
door
shut
upon
montgomery
she
shrieked
miss
ashburn
would
have
embraced
her
but
she
would
not
suffer
it
she
sunk
upon
the
floor
she
crossed
her
arms
upon
her
bosom
with
a
violent
pressure
as
if
to
bind
the
agony
her
teeth
grated
against
each
other
and
every
limb
shuddered
i
had
approached
her
with
miss
ashburn
and
scarcely
less
affected
than
miss
ashburn
herself
i
was
turning
away
to
hide
my
emotions
when
she
sprang
upon
her
feet
in
an
instant
and
grasping
my
arm
shall
not
go
without
me
she
said
sir
i
have
told
you
the
way
carry
me
back
to
the
castle
you
have
forgotten
your
caroline
forgotten
the
kind
murden
who
hazarded
so
much
to
save
you
replied
miss
valmont
never
forgot
any
one
she
took
her
hand
from
my
arm
and
lifted
both
hands
to
her
forehead
she
stood
immoveable
in
deep
musing
for
some
time
me
to
the
castle
at
length
she
exclaimed
without
changing
her
posture
or
looking
at
any
person
valmont
provide
a
dungeon
where
i
can
die
i
will
not
go
to
the
wood
oh
no
nor
to
my
chamber
she
groaned
and
whom
is
it
that
you
weep
thus
she
asked
abruptly
turning
round
to
miss
ashburn
my
sibella
she
bent
forward
and
gazed
intently
in
miss
ashburn
face
as
if
in
search
of
something
is
caroline
said
she
drawing
back
spreading
her
arms
wide
she
looked
down
upon
herself
then
every
muscle
of
her
face
convulsed
with
anguish
she
bent
her
eyes
upon
the
door
that
was
clement
oh
in
short
walter
a
thousand
tender
touches
followed
which
wrung
my
heart
to
pity
while
that
woman
had
the
insolence
and
brutality
to
call
herself
montgomery
wife
but
sibella
did
not
understand
her
or
if
she
did
was
nothing
his
look
his
tones
had
completed
the
work
and
her
mind
could
feel
nothing
beyond
other
dreadful
agonies
followed
but
under
the
suffering
of
those
she
was
patience
itself
she
was
conveyed
to
her
friend
chamber
and
in
three
hours
delivered
of
a
dead
child
i
waited
the
result
alone
in
miss
ashburn
library
canvassing
over
all
the
exquisite
concern
i
had
in
producing
such
misery
to
this
injured
sibella
had
i
been
buried
in
a
quick
sand
on
the
road
to
hipsley
her
noble
minded
caroline
and
the
tender
murden
might
by
due
preparation
have
robbed
clement
perfidy
of
half
its
sting
but
to
come
upon
her
thus
to
hurl
her
down
such
a
precipice
from
the
felicity
of
her
expectations
oh
no
wonder
her
life
should
be
in
danger
and
think
walter
what
i
must
have
felt
when
they
came
to
tell
me
so
in
such
a
moment
who
could
palliate
not
i
indeed
i
did
not
conceal
from
miss
ashburn
an
atom
of
the
truth
and
she
talked
like
an
angel
for
she
not
only
told
me
i
should
amend
but
taught
me
how
to
amend
one
little
satisfaction
indeed
visited
me
under
that
roof
i
saw
janetta
laundy
disgracefully
dismissed
she
it
was
i
doubt
not
that
made
this
match
to
satisfy
her
own
grasping
avarice
by
folly
would
you
believe
that
she
had
so
far
imposed
on
the
credulity
of
ashburn
that
she
dared
sneer
at
my
assertions
luckily
i
had
some
letters
in
my
lately
written
by
her
to
me
and
such
proofs
could
neither
be
denied
nor
parried
as
the
letters
pretty
fully
displayed
the
commerce
with
montgomery
ashburn
poured
on
her
a
torrent
of
abuses
but
scarcely
had
janetta
withdrawn
when
she
complained
that
her
daughter
had
made
her
house
odious
to
her
had
brought
a
rival
to
insult
her
and
finally
she
ordered
a
servant
to
enquire
if
montgomery
would
attend
her
to
the
opera
montgomery
was
no
where
to
be
found
and
next
miss
ashburn
gave
me
a
commission
no
less
walter
than
to
relate
my
worthy
exploits
to
murden
by
the
interest
of
miss
ashburn
name
i
was
admitted
to
his
chamber
when
i
saw
the
wasted
form
and
heard
the
hollow
voice
of
murden
and
knew
for
miss
ashburn
had
told
me
that
love
of
miss
valmont
had
brought
him
thus
near
the
grave
i
shuddered
at
the
idea
of
my
commission
he
heard
me
with
a
composure
which
shocked
while
it
astonished
me
till
i
mentioned
our
entering
ashburn
drawing
room
sir
cried
he
she
then
seen
him
i
replied
has
indeed
sir
said
he
know
all
that
remains
already
not
another
syllable
passed
between
us
till
i
rose
to
go
he
then
offered
me
his
hand
and
said
if
i
would
promise
not
to
pity
him
he
would
ask
to
see
me
again
and
so
he
shall
i
will
if
possible
see
him
before
he
dies
my
messenger
who
brings
you
this
letter
travels
for
tidings
respecting
miss
valmont
adieu
filmar
letter
xxxix
from
caroline
ashburn
to
george
valmont
sir
our
sibella
is
i
write
at
her
and
if
after
one
cool
investigation
of
the
past
you
can
lay
your
hand
on
your
heart
and
say
sibella
offended
me
i
was
ever
just
to
i
will
yield
up
the
earnest
wish
i
have
that
you
should
come
to
london
to
extend
the
forgiveness
you
have
already
granted
to
see
to
bless
her
she
dies
those
convulsive
starts
tell
me
nature
can
not
long
support
the
struggle
she
was
the
only
child
of
your
brother
sir
and
one
among
the
fairest
among
the
daughters
of
men
you
complain
sir
that
my
opinions
pay
too
little
deference
to
the
obedience
due
from
children
to
parents
and
in
answer
to
that
i
must
observe
i
know
not
of
any
opposing
duties
and
wherever
the
commands
of
parents
are
contrary
to
the
justice
due
from
being
to
being
i
hold
obedience
to
be
vice
the
perpetual
hue
and
cry
after
obedience
and
obedience
has
almost
driven
virtue
out
of
the
world
for
be
it
unlimited
unexamined
obedience
to
a
sovereign
to
a
parent
or
husband
the
mind
yielding
itself
to
implicit
unexamined
obedience
loses
its
individual
dignity
and
you
can
expect
no
more
of
a
man
than
of
a
brute
what
is
to
become
of
the
child
who
is
taught
never
to
think
or
act
for
himself
can
a
creature
thus
formed
ever
arrive
at
the
maturity
of
wisdom
how
is
he
who
has
never
reasoned
to
be
enabled
in
his
turn
to
train
his
offspring
otherwise
than
he
himself
was
trained
proud
of
sway
and
dominion
he
gratifies
every
impulse
of
caprice
blindly
commands
while
they
blindly
obey
and
thus
from
one
generation
to
another
the
world
is
peopled
with
slaves
and
the
human
mind
degraded
from
the
station
which
god
had
given
to
it
you
sent
clement
into
the
world
and
you
commanded
him
to
hate
it
but
you
never
told
him
why
it
merited
this
abhorrence
only
he
was
to
hate
because
it
pleased
you
that
he
should
hate
the
world
clement
montgomery
saw
every
thing
new
every
thing
fascinating
and
the
more
he
remembered
he
was
to
hate
the
more
he
loved
the
world
then
you
bid
him
make
himself
independent
and
you
had
not
given
him
one
lesson
of
independence
of
mind
without
which
he
must
ever
be
a
tool
and
dependent
indeed
sir
you
have
no
right
to
withhold
from
him
your
forgiveness
for
you
taught
him
by
your
own
example
to
say
one
thing
and
intend
another
in
your
own
mistakes
you
may
trace
the
foundation
of
his
vices
montgomery
has
indeed
heaped
upon
himself
an
infinite
load
of
mischiefs
and
you
sir
in
the
bitterness
of
your
resentment
could
not
wish
him
a
severer
punishment
than
i
believe
he
at
present
endures
my
beloved
and
sacrificed
friend
was
unhappily
led
into
his
presence
on
the
first
moment
of
her
arrival
she
claimed
him
as
her
own
and
he
must
have
been
marble
itself
had
not
that
interview
and
its
sad
consequences
to
the
deceived
injured
sibella
stung
him
with
remorse
yet
his
repentance
has
more
of
frenzy
than
feeling
several
times
he
attempted
to
force
his
way
into
sibella
chamber
and
finding
me
immoveable
resolved
that
he
should
not
see
her
he
gave
way
to
the
most
violent
bursts
of
indignation
and
invective
whose
chief
object
was
my
mother
at
length
he
quitted
the
house
and
it
is
said
that
in
grief
and
distraction
he
also
quitted
the
kingdom
but
i
understand
his
feeble
and
wavering
character
his
sorrow
will
abate
he
will
be
again
reconciled
to
himself
and
live
abounding
in
all
things
but
esteem
in
consequence
of
montgomery
departure
my
mother
has
vowed
an
everlasting
enmity
to
me
she
has
chosen
another
abode
and
forbidden
me
her
presence
it
is
sir
no
uncommon
case
for
persons
who
would
fly
from
the
consciousness
of
their
follies
to
shelter
themselves
under
resentment
and
accuse
others
of
malignantly
creating
those
misfortunes
for
them
which
were
the
unavoidable
consequences
of
their
own
errors
how
vain
and
futile
are
such
endeavours
and
how
strongly
do
they
help
to
prove
the
value
of
rectitude
which
brings
its
own
consolation
under
every
afflicting
circumstance
of
life
to
press
you
further
on
the
subject
of
your
coming
to
london
or
to
relate
the
particulars
which
have
befallen
sibella
would
be
only
to
give
you
unnecessary
pain
suffer
me
however
to
remind
you
once
more
that
the
moment
approaches
rapidly
upon
us
when
resentment
can
not
agitate
nor
forgiveness
soothe
her
i
remain
sir
your
sincere
well
wisher
caroline
ashburn
letter
xl
from
caroline
ashburn
to
lord
filmar
my
lord
i
scarcely
recollect
the
verbal
message
i
sent
in
answer
to
your
letter
of
yesterday
for
i
was
then
under
the
dominion
of
feelings
more
powerful
than
reason
yet
not
more
powerful
it
was
reason
had
yielded
for
a
time
her
place
i
will
fortify
myself
for
the
relation
of
the
events
of
yesterday
because
i
think
it
will
do
you
a
service
i
am
sure
you
are
not
incorrigible
and
one
example
of
the
wretched
consequences
of
error
has
often
more
power
than
a
volume
of
precepts
it
was
half
past
eleven
yesterday
morning
when
an
attendant
silently
beckoned
me
from
sibella
bed
in
the
antichamber
sir
thomas
gentleman
waited
to
inform
me
that
murden
was
in
my
study
i
could
scarcely
believe
i
was
awake
it
seemed
so
impossible
that
he
should
be
there
madam
said
the
young
man
persuasion
has
been
used
to
prevent
his
rash
design
and
since
sir
thomas
barlowe
by
the
advice
of
the
physicians
positively
refused
his
coming
to
visit
miss
valmont
he
has
neither
taken
rest
nor
sustenance
what
could
we
do
madam
but
indulge
him
how
indeed
could
they
act
otherwise
he
was
brought
my
lord
in
a
chair
and
had
fainted
once
by
the
way
much
affected
by
the
nature
of
his
enterprise
and
by
the
resolution
with
which
he
persisted
in
accomplishing
his
design
i
could
not
restrain
my
tears
when
i
joined
him
in
the
study
he
was
gasping
for
breath
and
seemed
ready
to
drop
from
the
arms
of
the
servant
who
supported
him
as
i
approached
him
and
took
his
hand
he
turned
his
head
away
from
me
an
increase
of
anxiety
and
something
of
ill
nature
contracted
his
brow
for
he
expected
a
decided
opposition
on
my
part
to
the
design
which
he
had
resolved
never
to
relinquish
my
dear
murden
i
said
he
interrupted
me
in
a
peevish
tone
he
came
he
said
to
see
sibella
he
see
her
and
if
i
refused
to
let
him
see
her
he
would
crawl
to
her
chamber
door
and
live
there
whilst
he
did
live
i
would
have
spoken
again
but
he
waved
his
hand
to
express
that
he
would
not
hear
me
and
rested
his
head
on
the
servant
shoulder
the
hand
which
i
still
held
though
he
had
twice
attempted
to
draw
it
from
mine
began
to
endure
a
consuming
heat
a
deep
hectic
colouring
overspread
his
cheek
and
i
imagined
disappointment
was
committing
more
ravages
on
him
in
one
way
than
indulgence
could
in
another
strongly
incited
to
lead
murden
instantly
to
my
friend
chamber
yet
unwilling
to
hazard
so
much
merely
on
my
own
judgment
i
retired
to
consult
with
beville
who
has
kindly
given
me
her
society
and
assistance
since
my
mother
quitted
the
house
beville
suggested
to
me
an
idea
which
determined
me
to
permit
the
interview
unless
sibella
herself
should
object
to
seeing
murden
i
must
tell
you
my
lord
that
from
the
fatal
day
when
you
was
a
feeling
witness
of
her
agonies
sibella
has
been
perfectly
or
rather
horridly
calm
never
has
she
named
clement
nor
has
she
ever
wept
she
insisted
on
having
the
corpse
of
her
infant
brought
to
her
before
its
burial
and
while
she
pressed
it
to
her
burning
bosom
she
said
senseless
earth
in
quitting
life
so
soon
thou
hast
not
lost
but
gained
what
art
thou
nothing
thy
members
will
not
swell
into
strength
and
proportion
life
will
not
inform
them
thy
heart
will
never
beat
and
it
shall
not
babe
thou
art
gone
for
ever
none
laments
for
thee
she
who
should
have
been
thy
mother
weeps
not
for
go
babe
go
to
thy
cold
shelter
soon
will
that
shelter
be
mine
but
i
can
not
afford
thee
warmth
for
i
shall
be
cold
senseless
dead
as
thou
art
as
she
spoke
her
eye
had
no
moisture
and
she
delivered
up
the
infant
without
shedding
one
tear
but
the
oppression
she
endured
for
want
of
this
salutary
relief
was
dreadful
to
behold
beville
was
of
opinion
that
the
altered
and
countenance
of
murden
the
recollection
of
his
kindness
and
his
sufferings
for
her
would
surprise
affect
her
turn
her
consideration
from
herself
to
him
and
call
forth
a
sympathy
which
must
produce
tears
i
had
less
hope
of
the
success
of
the
experiment
in
this
way
to
sibella
than
beville
entertained
yet
i
had
hope
and
i
also
persuaded
myself
that
a
kind
word
from
her
would
give
to
murden
a
renewal
of
vigour
and
prove
the
chearing
companion
of
his
few
remaining
days
sibella
was
at
this
time
more
composed
than
usual
and
on
being
informed
of
murden
desire
she
expressed
an
earnest
wish
to
see
him
i
returned
to
the
study
are
come
to
lead
me
to
her
said
murden
impatiently
i
replied
am
sibella
herself
desires
it
me
give
me
said
he
stretching
forth
his
hand
and
his
servant
presented
some
liquid
he
held
in
a
glass
but
murden
pushed
it
from
him
me
there
said
he
my
strength
is
gone
i
saw
that
he
trembled
excessively
and
gladly
would
i
have
retracted
my
consent
but
it
was
too
late
i
could
nothing
more
than
hasten
the
interview
that
the
expectation
of
it
might
not
prey
on
him
thus
dreadfully
we
prevailed
on
him
to
taste
the
liquid
and
then
his
attendants
carried
him
in
their
arms
to
the
chamber
door
where
at
his
own
desire
they
stood
still
for
a
moment
or
two
when
he
was
borne
into
the
room
he
suddenly
assumed
a
strength
which
had
before
totally
failed
him
and
tottered
to
the
seat
beside
neither
he
gazed
till
he
could
gaze
no
longer
and
leaning
back
his
head
burst
into
a
violent
flood
of
tears
sibella
was
not
moved
she
put
out
her
hand
towards
his
i
lifted
his
and
gave
it
her
murden
said
she
as
she
pressed
his
hand
have
been
very
kind
to
me
tell
me
how
i
can
thank
you
were
once
unkind
to
me
replied
murden
sobbing
hated
me
you
shunned
me
for
i
did
not
know
yet
i
fancied
myself
infallibly
discerning
she
turned
her
head
away
do
not
do
not
turn
from
me
miss
valmont
i
once
talked
with
you
in
the
ruin
do
you
remember
it
you
were
not
so
ill
then
as
you
are
now
you
miss
valmont
was
well
did
think
so
she
said
and
sighed
murden
comprehended
the
fullest
force
of
her
meaning
he
looked
wildly
around
the
apartment
me
go
let
me
go
said
he
eagerly
withdrawing
his
hand
from
sibella
and
attempting
to
rise
i
beckoned
in
his
two
attendants
who
lifted
him
from
his
seat
you
go
and
not
bid
me
farewel
murden
asked
sibella
he
started
at
the
plaintive
off
cried
he
ye
dare
take
me
from
her
ere
my
errand
is
completed
is
completed
my
dear
murden
said
i
have
seen
sibella
bid
her
farewel
and
part
yes
said
he
sitting
down
again
beside
her
shall
part
we
are
now
on
the
very
verge
of
oh
dear
good
miss
ashburn
bless
you
for
ever
as
he
spoke
he
pressed
each
of
my
hands
alternately
to
his
dear
miss
ashburn
fare
you
well
murden
you
must
go
said
i
repeated
he
why
i
know
i
i
have
no
choice
miss
ashburn
but
allow
me
a
little
longer
wo
you
turning
to
sibella
me
a
very
little
longer
i
will
replied
sibella
it
will
give
you
satisfaction
said
he
after
a
pause
during
which
he
gazed
intently
on
sibella
his
countenance
underwent
a
striking
alteration
he
made
a
motion
for
something
to
be
given
to
him
but
when
the
servant
approached
he
put
him
aside
his
head
dropped
against
the
side
of
the
chair
and
the
hand
he
had
just
lifted
to
his
forehead
fell
upon
the
bed
sibella
placed
it
between
both
of
her
he
drew
his
breath
slowly
and
heavily
once
i
thought
he
had
fainted
and
offered
to
support
him
no
no
he
said
and
shortly
after
i
believe
he
slept
at
that
time
all
who
were
in
the
apartment
observed
a
profound
silence
sibella
in
deep
thought
continued
to
hold
his
hand
sometimes
she
looked
upon
murden
and
in
those
expressive
looks
i
read
the
anguish
of
her
heart
she
could
not
as
beville
had
supposed
separate
his
sufferings
from
her
own
i
perceived
that
her
emotions
were
kindling
into
agony
and
i
arose
from
my
seat
undetermined
which
way
i
could
relieve
her
when
a
loud
and
dreadful
groan
from
sibella
roused
murden
from
his
short
interval
of
forgetfulness
have
pity
said
murden
sibella
uttered
a
second
groan
valmont
exclaimed
murden
me
not
a
name
cried
sibella
own
none
what
am
i
a
shadow
a
dream
will
you
oblige
me
added
she
vehemently
grasping
hand
to
him
the
name
you
used
to
me
bid
him
murder
that
oh
your
touch
is
ice
she
exclaimed
throwing
his
hand
suddenly
from
her
have
chilled
my
blood
a
moment
after
she
recollected
herself
murden
said
she
warm
yourself
why
are
you
so
cold
i
too
am
but
a
shadow
replied
murden
me
miss
valmont
i
must
call
you
it
was
when
you
came
to
seek
your
fawn
in
the
ruin
that
you
talked
with
me
there
do
you
remember
it
do
miss
valmont
miss
valmont
methought
you
never
looked
so
lovely
never
was
so
gentle
as
while
you
spake
two
words
only
two
and
can
you
not
remember
that
i
said
to
you
when
remembrances
of
love
shall
be
no
longer
remembrances
of
happiness
then
god
do
you
reproach
me
with
living
cried
sibella
starting
up
in
the
bed
in
a
phrenzy
you
not
i
expired
when
oh
am
i
not
dead
dead
already
let
the
same
grave
receive
us
bending
forward
he
locked
her
in
his
arms
and
sunk
upon
her
pillow
never
to
rise
again
it
is
easier
my
lord
for
you
to
imagine
than
for
me
to
describe
the
consequence
of
yesterday
event
to
my
beloved
and
dying
friend
her
convulsions
become
each
hour
more
and
more
rapid
and
exhausting
yet
she
has
intervals
of
composure
and
even
of
rest
and
these
serve
to
detain
a
little
longer
her
bursting
spirit
within
the
fading
form
oh
cruel
those
who
have
been
the
means
of
thus
early
separating
a
mind
and
form
so
worthy
of
happiness
so
mated
to
each
other
as
for
myself
i
have
endured
much
and
have
much
yet
to
endure
for
remembrances
of
murden
and
sibella
of
their
virtues
and
misfortunes
will
live
with
me
will
be
the
cherished
tender
companions
of
many
hours
nor
shall
that
which
the
world
calls
pleasure
ever
buy
me
from
one
of
those
hours
with
the
richest
of
her
temptations
last
night
while
sibella
slept
i
would
have
slept
also
but
the
scene
of
yesterday
lay
a
cumbrous
load
upon
my
heart
i
rose
and
passed
to
the
chamber
where
the
corpse
of
murden
is
deposited
his
faults
fled
from
me
i
saw
only
murden
i
remembered
him
living
and
now
i
looked
on
him
my
lord
my
lord
what
a
contrast
what
a
pang
a
smile
of
something
more
than
peace
illumines
even
now
the
face
from
whence
animation
is
gone
for
ever
it
was
his
last
smile
the
smile
he
had
so
dearly
purchased
his
heart
indeed
dictated
that
smile
for
it
expanded
with
joy
when
he
felt
he
should
die
with
her
for
whom
he
died
fatal
end
of
an
ungoverned
passion
virtuous
in
its
object
but
vicious
in
its
excess
the
corpse
still
remains
in
the
house
why
should
i
part
with
it
none
loved
him
better
a
sleep
almost
like
death
still
locks
up
the
faculties
of
sibella
during
her
last
interval
from
pain
and
convulsions
she
gave
her
final
directions
and
you
my
lord
are
concerned
therein
valmont
is
sick
sick
at
heart
he
could
not
come
to
london
but
he
sent
his
steward
with
forgiveness
blessings
and
an
earnest
request
that
sibella
would
make
her
own
disposition
of
her
fortune
by
which
he
has
resolved
most
faithfully
to
abide
there
is
a
sum
in
hand
of
near
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
out
of
which
she
has
desired
that
your
debts
may
be
discharged
my
lord
her
request
to
you
is
that
you
will
in
future
refrain
from
the
pernicious
practice
by
which
they
were
incurred
i
have
no
doubt
but
you
will
and
certain
am
i
my
lord
that
you
may
find
means
of
disposing
of
your
time
that
in
real
pleasure
will
beggar
all
comparison
with
those
to
which
you
have
been
accustomed
i
am
summoned
to
sibella
chamber
again
sibella
her
fits
have
ceased
and
death
becomes
gentle
in
its
preparation
my
caroline
said
she
as
i
approached
her
bed
and
let
me
bid
you
farewel
i
find
there
is
something
yet
for
me
to
feel
in
leaving
methought
she
added
after
a
pause
had
been
dead
in
me
i
have
had
strange
feelings
caroline
and
now
i
seem
awakening
from
a
fearful
dream
i
have
lost
the
raging
fire
which
consumed
me
early
scenes
recur
and
here
laying
her
hand
on
her
bosom
swells
as
if
as
if
i
yet
had
affections
so
saying
the
melting
sufferer
burst
into
tears
and
my
fond
hopes
would
have
persuaded
me
that
these
tears
were
the
beginning
of
her
restoration
no
my
lord
it
is
only
fondness
that
could
for
one
moment
entertain
the
supposition
not
let
us
weep
said
she
there
is
a
person
is
i
desire
it
caroline
whom
you
must
forgive
pity
and
befriend
when
you
meet
him
clement
the
name
hung
upon
her
quivering
lips
him
to
be
sincere
tell
all
the
world
so
my
uncle
secrets
could
have
done
me
but
temporary
harm
it
was
mine
own
secrets
destroyed
me
oh
that
fatal
contract
a
long
pause
succeeded
but
she
neither
wept
not
sighed
she
had
folded
her
hands
upon
her
bosom
and
she
looked
intently
upward
again
raising
herself
she
embraced
me
and
then
she
said
murden
he
had
his
secrets
too
and
he
has
died
for
them
my
lord
it
is
she
expired
in
my
arms
yes
they
shall
be
entombed
together
the
dearer
parts
of
my
i
loved
them
both
as
i
never
loved
man
nor
woman
beside
