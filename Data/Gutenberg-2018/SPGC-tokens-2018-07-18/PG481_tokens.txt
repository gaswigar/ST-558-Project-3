in
the
bishop
carriage
by
miriam
michelson
i
when
the
thing
was
at
its
hottest
i
bolted
tom
like
the
darling
he
is
yes
you
are
old
fellow
you
as
precious
to
me
as
as
you
are
to
the
police
if
they
could
only
get
their
hands
on
you
well
tom
drew
off
the
crowd
having
passed
the
old
gentleman
watch
to
me
and
i
made
for
the
women
rooms
the
station
was
crowded
as
it
always
is
in
the
afternoon
and
in
a
minute
i
was
strolling
into
the
big
square
room
saying
slowly
to
myself
to
keep
me
steady
nancy
you
a
college
girl
just
in
from
bryn
mawr
to
meet
your
papa
just
see
if
your
hat
on
straight
i
did
going
up
to
the
big
glass
and
looking
beyond
my
excited
face
to
the
room
behind
me
there
sat
the
woman
who
can
never
nurse
her
baby
except
where
everybody
can
see
her
in
a
railroad
station
there
was
the
woman
who
always
hungry
nibbling
chocolates
out
of
a
box
and
the
woman
fallen
asleep
with
her
hat
on
the
side
and
hairpins
dropping
out
of
her
hair
and
the
woman
who
beside
herself
with
fear
that
she
miss
her
train
and
the
woman
who
is
taking
notes
about
the
other
women
rigs
and
and
i
did
like
the
look
of
that
man
with
the
cap
who
opened
the
swinging
door
a
bit
and
peeped
in
the
women
is
no
place
for
a
man
nor
for
a
girl
who
got
somebody
else
watch
inside
her
waist
luckily
my
back
was
toward
him
but
just
as
the
door
swung
back
he
might
have
caught
the
reflection
of
my
face
in
a
mirror
hanging
opposite
to
the
big
one
i
retreated
going
to
an
inner
room
where
the
ladies
were
having
the
maid
brush
their
gowns
soiled
from
suburban
travel
and
the
dirty
station
the
deuce
is
in
it
the
way
women
stare
i
took
off
my
hat
and
jacket
for
a
reason
to
stay
there
and
hung
them
up
as
leisurely
as
i
could
nance
i
said
under
my
breath
to
the
girl
in
the
mirror
who
gave
a
quick
glance
about
the
room
as
i
bent
to
wash
my
hands
women
stare
they
women
there
no
meaning
in
their
look
if
they
were
men
now
you
might
twitter
i
smoothed
my
hair
and
reached
out
my
hand
to
get
my
hat
and
jacket
when
when
oh
it
was
long
long
enough
to
cover
you
from
your
chin
to
your
heels
it
was
a
dark
warm
red
and
it
had
a
high
collar
of
chinchilla
that
was
fairly
scrumptious
and
just
above
it
the
hat
hung
a
toque
caught
up
on
the
side
with
some
of
the
same
fur
the
black
maid
misunderstood
my
involuntary
gesture
i
had
all
my
best
duds
on
and
when
a
lot
of
women
stare
it
makes
the
woman
they
stare
at
peacock
naturally
and
and
well
ask
tom
what
he
thinks
of
my
style
when
i
on
parade
at
any
rate
it
was
the
maid
fault
she
took
down
the
coat
and
hat
and
held
them
for
me
as
though
they
were
mine
what
could
i
do
just
slip
into
the
beauty
and
set
the
toque
on
my
head
the
fool
girl
that
owned
them
was
having
another
maid
mend
a
tear
in
her
skirt
over
in
the
corner
the
little
place
was
crowded
anyway
i
had
both
the
coat
and
hat
on
and
was
out
into
the
big
anteroom
in
a
jiffy
what
nearly
wrecked
me
was
the
cut
of
that
coat
it
positively
made
me
shiver
with
pleasure
when
i
passed
and
saw
myself
in
that
long
mirror
my
but
i
was
great
the
hang
of
that
coat
the
long
incurving
sweep
in
the
back
and
the
high
fur
collar
up
to
one
nose
even
if
it
is
a
nose
oh
i
stayed
and
looked
a
second
too
long
for
just
as
i
was
pulling
the
flaring
hat
a
bit
over
my
face
the
doors
swung
as
an
old
lady
came
in
and
there
behind
her
was
that
same
curious
man
face
with
the
cap
above
it
trapped
me
not
much
i
did
wait
a
minute
but
threw
the
doors
open
with
a
gesture
that
might
have
belonged
to
the
queen
of
spain
i
almost
ran
into
his
arms
he
gave
an
exclamation
i
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
as
i
hooked
the
collar
close
to
my
throat
and
swept
past
him
he
weakened
that
coat
was
too
jolly
much
for
him
it
was
for
me
too
as
i
ran
down
the
stairs
its
influence
so
worked
on
me
that
i
did
know
just
which
vanderbilt
i
was
i
got
out
on
the
sidewalk
all
right
and
was
just
about
to
take
a
car
when
the
turnstile
swung
round
and
there
was
that
same
man
with
the
cap
his
face
was
a
funny
mixture
of
doubt
and
determination
but
it
meant
the
correction
for
me
nance
olden
it
over
i
said
to
myself
but
it
was
for
it
was
then
that
i
caught
sight
of
the
carriage
it
was
a
fat
low
comfortable
elegant
sober
carriage
wide
and
with
wheels
and
the
two
heavy
horses
were
fat
and
elegant
and
sober
too
and
wide
and
i
did
know
it
was
the
bishop
then
i
did
care
whose
it
was
it
was
empty
and
it
was
mine
i
rather
go
to
the
correction
being
too
young
to
get
to
the
place
you
bound
for
tom
dorgan
in
it
than
in
the
patrol
wagon
at
any
rate
it
was
all
the
chance
i
had
i
slipped
in
closing
the
door
sharply
behind
me
the
man
on
the
box
he
was
wide
and
too
was
tired
waiting
i
suppose
for
he
continued
to
doze
gently
his
high
coachman
collar
up
over
his
ears
i
cursed
that
collar
which
had
prevented
his
hearing
the
door
close
for
then
he
might
have
driven
off
but
it
was
great
inside
soft
and
warm
the
cushions
of
dark
plum
the
seat
wide
and
roomy
a
church
paper
some
notes
for
the
bishop
next
sermon
and
a
copy
of
quo
vadis
i
just
snuggled
down
trust
me
i
leaned
far
back
and
lay
low
when
i
did
peek
out
the
window
i
saw
the
man
with
the
brass
buttons
and
the
cap
turning
to
go
inside
again
victory
he
had
lost
the
scent
who
would
look
for
nancy
olden
in
the
bishop
carriage
now
you
know
how
early
i
got
up
yesterday
to
catch
the
train
so
tom
and
i
could
come
in
with
the
people
and
be
naturally
mingling
with
them
and
you
remember
the
dance
the
night
before
i
had
had
more
than
three
hours
sleep
and
the
snug
warmth
of
that
coach
was
just
nuts
to
me
after
the
freezing
ride
into
town
i
did
dare
get
out
for
fear
of
some
other
man
in
a
cap
and
buttons
somewhere
on
the
lookout
i
knew
they
could
be
on
to
my
or
they
have
nabbed
me
before
this
after
a
bit
i
did
want
to
get
out
i
was
so
warm
and
comfortable
and
elegant
o
tom
you
should
have
seen
your
nance
in
that
coat
and
in
the
bishop
carriage
first
thing
i
knew
i
was
dreaming
you
and
i
were
being
married
and
you
had
brass
buttons
all
over
you
and
i
had
the
cloak
all
right
but
it
was
a
and
the
chinchilla
was
a
wormy
sort
of
orange
blossoms
and
and
i
waked
when
the
handle
of
the
door
turned
and
the
bishop
got
in
asleep
that
what
i
actually
been
asleep
and
what
did
i
do
now
that
easy
fell
asleep
again
there
was
anything
else
to
do
not
really
asleep
this
time
you
know
just
just
asleep
enough
to
be
wide
awake
to
any
chance
there
was
in
it
the
horses
had
started
and
the
carriage
was
across
the
street
before
the
bishop
noticed
me
he
was
a
little
bishop
not
big
and
fat
and
like
the
rig
but
short
and
lean
with
a
little
white
beard
and
the
softest
eye
and
the
softest
heart
and
the
softest
head
just
listen
lord
bless
me
he
exclaimed
hurriedly
putting
on
his
spectacles
and
looking
about
bewildered
i
was
slumbering
sweetly
in
the
corner
but
i
could
see
between
my
lashes
that
he
thought
he
jumped
into
somebody
else
carriage
the
sight
of
his
book
and
his
papers
comforted
him
though
and
before
he
could
make
a
resolution
i
let
the
jolting
of
the
carriage
as
it
crossed
the
throw
me
gently
against
him
daddy
i
murmured
sleepily
letting
my
head
rest
on
his
little
prim
shoulder
that
comforted
him
too
hush
your
laughing
tom
dorgan
i
mean
calling
him
daddy
seemed
to
kind
of
take
the
cuss
off
the
situation
my
child
he
began
very
gently
oh
daddy
i
exclaimed
snuggling
down
close
to
him
you
kept
me
waiting
so
long
i
went
to
sleep
i
thought
you
never
come
he
put
his
arm
about
my
shoulders
in
a
fatherly
way
you
know
i
found
out
later
the
bishop
never
had
had
a
daughter
i
guess
he
thought
he
had
one
now
such
a
simple
dear
old
soul
just
the
same
tom
dorgan
if
he
had
been
my
father
i
never
be
doing
stunts
with
tipsy
watches
for
you
nor
if
i
had
any
father
now
do
get
mad
think
of
the
bishop
with
his
gentle
thin
old
arm
about
my
shoulders
holding
me
for
just
a
second
as
though
i
was
his
daughter
my
think
of
it
and
me
nance
olden
with
that
fat
man
watch
in
my
waist
and
some
girl
beautiful
long
coat
and
hat
on
all
covered
with
chinchilla
there
some
mistake
my
little
girl
he
said
shaking
me
gently
to
wake
me
up
for
i
was
going
to
sleep
again
he
feared
oh
i
knew
you
were
kept
at
the
office
i
interrupted
quickly
i
preferred
to
be
farther
from
the
station
with
that
girl
red
coat
before
i
got
out
we
missed
our
train
anyway
have
we
after
this
daddy
dear
let
not
take
this
route
if
we
go
straight
through
on
the
one
road
we
would
have
this
drive
across
town
every
time
i
was
wondering
before
i
fell
asleep
what
in
the
world
i
do
in
this
big
city
if
you
did
come
he
forgot
to
withdraw
his
arm
so
occupied
was
he
by
my
predicament
what
would
you
do
my
child
if
you
had
had
missed
your
your
father
was
it
clumsy
of
him
he
wanted
to
break
it
to
me
gently
and
this
was
the
best
he
could
do
what
would
i
do
i
gasped
indignantly
why
daddy
imagine
me
alone
and
and
without
money
why
why
how
can
you
there
there
he
said
patting
me
soothingly
on
the
shoulder
that
baby
of
a
bishop
the
very
thought
of
nancy
olden
out
alone
in
the
streets
was
too
much
for
him
he
had
put
his
free
hand
into
his
pocket
and
had
just
taken
out
a
bill
and
was
trying
to
plan
a
way
to
offer
it
to
me
and
reveal
the
fact
to
poor
modest
little
nance
olden
that
he
was
not
her
own
daddy
when
an
awful
thing
happened
we
had
got
up
street
as
far
as
the
when
we
were
caught
in
the
jam
of
carriages
in
front
the
last
afternoon
opera
of
the
season
was
just
over
i
was
so
busy
thinking
what
would
be
my
next
move
that
i
did
notice
much
outside
and
i
did
want
to
move
tom
not
a
bit
playing
the
bishop
daughter
in
a
trailing
coat
of
red
trimmed
with
chinchilla
is
just
your
nancy
graft
but
the
dear
little
bishop
gave
a
jump
that
almost
knocked
the
roof
off
the
carriage
pulled
his
arm
from
behind
me
and
dropped
the
bill
he
held
as
though
it
burned
him
it
fell
in
my
lap
i
jammed
it
into
my
coat
pocket
where
is
it
now
just
you
wait
tom
dorgan
and
you
find
out
i
followed
the
bishop
eyes
his
face
was
scarlet
now
right
next
to
our
carriage
mine
and
the
bishop
there
was
another
not
quite
so
fat
and
heavy
and
big
but
smart
i
tell
you
with
the
silver
harness
jangling
and
the
horses
arching
their
backs
under
their
jackets
monogrammed
in
leather
all
the
same
i
could
see
anything
to
cause
a
loving
father
to
let
go
his
onliest
daughter
in
such
a
hurry
till
the
old
lady
inside
bent
forward
again
and
gave
us
another
look
her
face
told
it
then
it
was
a
big
smooth
face
with
chins
her
hair
was
white
and
her
nose
was
curved
and
the
pearls
in
her
big
ears
brought
out
every
ugly
spot
on
her
face
her
lips
were
thin
and
her
neck
hung
with
diamonds
looked
like
a
bed
with
bolsters
and
pillows
piled
high
and
her
eyes
oh
tom
her
eyes
they
were
little
and
very
gray
and
they
bored
their
way
straight
through
the
windows
hers
and
ours
and
hit
the
bishop
plumb
in
the
face
my
if
i
could
only
have
laughed
the
bishop
the
dear
prim
little
bishop
in
his
own
carriage
with
his
arm
about
a
young
woman
in
red
and
chinchilla
offering
her
a
and
dowager
diamonds
her
eyes
popping
out
of
her
head
at
the
sight
and
she
one
of
the
lady
pillars
of
his
church
oh
tom
it
took
all
of
this
to
make
that
poor
innocent
next
to
me
realize
how
he
looked
in
her
eyes
but
you
see
it
was
over
in
a
minute
the
carriage
wheels
were
unlocked
and
the
blue
coupe
went
whirling
away
and
we
in
the
carriage
followed
slowly
i
decided
that
i
had
enough
now
and
here
in
the
middle
of
all
these
carriages
was
a
bully
good
time
and
place
for
me
to
get
away
i
turned
to
the
bishop
he
was
blushing
like
a
boy
i
blushed
too
yes
i
did
tom
dorgan
but
it
was
because
i
was
bursting
with
laughter
oh
dear
i
exclaimed
in
sudden
dismay
you
not
my
father
no
no
my
dear
i
i
not
he
stammered
his
face
purple
now
with
embarrassment
i
was
just
trying
to
tell
you
you
poor
little
girl
of
your
mistake
and
planning
a
way
to
help
you
when
he
made
a
gesture
of
despair
toward
the
side
where
the
coupe
had
been
i
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
and
shrinking
over
into
the
corner
i
cried
let
me
out
let
me
out
you
not
my
father
oh
let
me
out
why
certainly
child
but
i
old
enough
surely
to
be
and
i
wish
i
wish
i
were
you
do
the
dignity
and
tenderness
and
courtesy
in
his
voice
sort
of
sobered
me
but
all
at
once
i
remembered
the
face
of
dowager
diamonds
and
i
understood
oh
because
of
her
i
said
smiling
and
pointing
to
the
side
where
the
coupe
had
been
my
but
it
was
a
rotten
bad
move
i
ought
to
have
been
strapped
for
it
oh
tom
tom
it
takes
a
red
coat
with
chinchilla
to
make
a
thing
like
me
into
the
girl
he
thought
i
was
he
stiffened
and
sat
up
like
a
prim
little
his
soft
eyes
hurt
like
a
dog
that
been
wounded
i
wo
tell
you
what
i
did
then
no
i
wo
and
you
understand
but
just
that
minute
i
cared
more
for
what
he
thought
of
me
than
whether
i
got
to
the
correction
or
anywhere
else
it
made
us
friends
in
a
minute
and
when
he
stopped
the
carriage
to
let
me
out
my
hand
was
still
in
his
but
i
would
go
i
made
up
my
mind
to
see
him
out
of
his
part
of
the
scrape
and
first
thing
you
know
we
were
driving
up
toward
the
square
if
you
please
to
dowager
diamonds
house
he
thought
it
was
his
scheme
the
poor
lamb
to
put
me
in
her
charge
till
my
lost
daddy
could
send
for
me
he
no
more
idea
that
i
was
steering
him
toward
her
that
he
was
doing
the
only
thing
possible
the
only
square
thing
by
his
reputation
than
he
had
that
nance
olden
had
been
raised
by
the
cruelty
and
then
flung
herself
away
on
the
first
handsome
irish
boy
she
met
that
do
tom
girls
if
you
could
have
seen
dowager
diamonds
face
when
she
came
down
the
stairs
the
bishop
card
in
her
hand
and
into
the
gorgeous
parlor
it
have
been
as
good
as
a
front
seat
at
the
show
she
was
mad
and
she
was
curious
and
she
was
amazed
and
she
was
disarmed
for
the
very
nerve
of
his
bringing
me
to
her
staggered
her
so
that
she
could
hardly
believe
she
seen
what
she
had
my
dear
ramsay
he
began
confused
a
bit
by
his
remembrance
of
how
her
face
had
looked
fifteen
minutes
before
i
bring
to
you
an
unfortunate
child
who
mistook
my
carriage
for
her
father
this
afternoon
at
the
station
she
is
a
college
girl
a
stranger
in
town
and
till
her
father
claims
her
oh
the
baby
the
baby
she
was
stiffening
like
a
rod
before
his
very
eyes
how
did
his
words
explain
his
having
his
arm
round
the
unfortunate
child
his
conscience
was
so
clean
that
the
dear
little
man
actually
overlooked
the
fact
that
it
was
my
presence
in
the
carriage
but
his
conduct
there
that
had
excited
dowager
diamonds
and
did
the
story
sound
thin
i
tell
you
tom
when
it
comes
to
lying
to
a
woman
you
got
to
think
up
something
stronger
than
it
takes
to
make
a
man
believe
in
you
if
you
happen
to
be
female
yourself
i
did
wait
for
him
to
finish
but
waltzed
right
in
i
danced
straight
up
to
that
side
of
beef
with
the
diamonds
still
on
it
and
flinging
my
arms
about
her
turned
a
coy
eye
on
the
bishop
you
said
your
wife
was
out
of
town
daddy
i
cried
gaily
have
you
got
another
wife
besides
mummy
the
poor
bishop
do
you
think
he
tumbled
not
a
bit
not
a
bit
he
sat
there
gasping
like
a
fish
and
dowager
diamonds
surprised
by
my
sudden
attack
stood
bolt
upright
about
as
pleasant
to
hug
as
as
you
are
tom
when
you
jealous
the
trouble
with
the
bishop
set
is
that
it
deadly
slow
now
if
i
had
really
been
the
bishop
daughter
all
right
i
go
on
oh
mummy
i
went
on
quickly
you
know
how
i
said
it
tom
the
way
i
told
you
after
that
last
row
that
dan
christensen
was
near
so
as
you
remember
oh
mummy
you
do
know
how
good
it
feels
to
get
home
out
there
at
that
awful
college
studying
and
studying
and
studying
sometimes
i
thought
i
lose
my
senses
a
girl
out
there
now
suffering
from
nervous
prostration
she
worked
so
hard
preparing
for
the
what
her
name
i
ca
think
i
ca
think
my
head
so
tired
but
it
sounds
like
mine
a
lot
like
mine
once
i
think
it
was
yesterday
i
thought
it
was
mine
and
i
made
up
my
mind
suddenly
to
come
right
home
and
bring
it
with
me
but
it
ca
be
mine
can
it
it
ca
be
my
name
she
got
it
ca
be
mummy
say
it
ca
say
it
ca
tom
i
ought
to
have
gone
on
the
stage
i
go
yet
when
you
sent
up
some
day
yes
i
will
you
be
where
you
ca
stop
me
i
could
see
the
bishop
but
the
dowager
oh
i
got
her
not
so
bad
an
old
body
either
if
you
only
take
her
the
right
way
first
she
was
suspicious
and
then
she
was
scared
and
then
bit
by
bit
the
stiffness
melted
out
of
her
her
arms
came
up
about
me
and
there
i
was
lying
all
comfy
with
the
diamonds
on
her
neck
boring
rosettes
in
my
cheeks
and
she
over
me
and
patting
me
and
telling
me
not
to
get
excited
that
it
was
all
right
and
now
i
was
home
mummy
would
take
care
of
me
she
would
that
she
would
she
did
she
got
me
on
to
a
lounge
soft
as
as
marshmallows
and
she
piled
one
silk
pillow
after
another
behind
my
back
come
dear
let
me
help
you
off
with
your
coat
she
cooed
bending
over
me
oh
mummy
it
so
cold
ca
i
please
keep
it
on
to
let
that
coat
off
me
was
to
give
the
whole
thing
away
my
rig
underneath
though
good
enough
for
your
girl
tom
on
a
holiday
just
what
they
wear
in
the
square
and
d
know
you
say
silly
but
i
had
a
conviction
that
with
that
coat
i
should
say
to
the
nerve
i
had
since
i
got
into
the
bishop
carriage
and
from
there
into
society
i
let
her
take
the
hat
though
and
i
could
see
by
the
way
she
handled
it
that
it
was
all
right
the
thing
her
kind
you
know
oh
the
girl
i
got
it
from
had
good
taste
all
right
i
closed
my
eyes
for
a
moment
as
i
lay
there
and
she
stood
stroking
my
hair
she
must
have
thought
i
fallen
asleep
for
she
turned
to
the
bishop
and
holding
out
her
hand
she
said
softly
my
dear
dear
bishop
you
are
the
the
saintliest
man
on
earth
because
you
are
so
beautifully
yourself
you
must
pardon
me
i
am
ashamed
to
say
it
but
i
shall
have
no
rest
till
i
do
when
i
saw
you
in
the
carriage
downtown
with
that
poor
demented
child
i
thought
for
just
a
moment
oh
can
you
forgive
me
it
shows
what
an
evil
mind
i
have
but
you
who
know
so
well
what
edward
is
what
my
life
has
been
with
him
will
see
how
much
reason
i
have
to
be
suspicious
of
all
men
i
shook
i
laughed
so
hard
what
a
corker
her
edward
must
be
see
tom
poor
old
dowager
up
in
the
square
having
the
same
luck
with
her
man
as
molly
elliott
down
in
the
alley
has
with
hers
i
wonder
if
you
all
alike
no
for
there
the
bishop
he
had
taken
her
hand
sympathizingly
forgivingly
but
his
silence
made
me
curious
i
knew
he
would
let
the
old
lady
believe
for
a
moment
i
was
luny
if
once
he
could
be
sure
himself
that
i
was
you
lie
tom
dorgan
he
would
well
but
the
poor
baby
how
could
he
expect
to
see
through
a
game
that
had
caught
the
dowager
herself
still
i
could
hear
him
walking
softly
toward
me
and
i
felt
him
looking
keenly
down
at
me
long
before
i
opened
my
eyes
when
i
did
you
should
have
seen
him
jump
guilty
he
felt
i
could
see
the
blood
rush
up
under
his
clear
thin
old
skin
soft
as
a
baby
to
find
himself
caught
trying
to
spy
out
my
secret
i
just
looked
up
at
him
you
know
the
way
molly
kid
does
when
he
wakes
i
looked
a
long
long
time
as
though
i
was
puzzled
daddy
i
said
slowly
sitting
up
you
you
are
my
daddy
ai
you
yes
yes
of
course
it
was
the
dowager
who
got
between
him
and
me
hinting
heavily
at
him
with
nods
and
frowns
but
the
dear
old
fellow
only
got
pinker
in
the
effort
to
look
a
lie
and
not
say
it
still
he
looked
relieved
evidently
he
thought
i
was
luny
all
right
but
that
i
had
lucid
intervals
i
heard
him
whisper
something
like
this
to
the
dowager
just
before
the
maid
came
in
with
tea
for
me
yes
tom
dorgan
tea
for
nancy
olden
off
a
silver
salver
out
of
a
cup
like
a
painted
eggshell
my
but
that
almost
floored
me
i
was
afraid
i
give
myself
dead
away
with
all
those
little
jars
and
jugs
so
i
said
i
was
hungry
though
lord
knows
i
had
had
anything
to
eat
since
early
morning
but
the
dowager
sent
the
maid
away
and
took
the
tray
herself
operating
all
the
jugs
and
pots
for
me
and
then
tried
to
feed
me
the
tea
she
was
about
as
handy
as
molly
little
sister
is
with
the
baby
but
i
allowed
myself
to
be
coaxed
and
drank
it
down
tea
tom
dorgan
ever
taste
tea
if
you
knew
how
to
behave
yourself
in
polite
society
i
give
you
a
card
to
my
friend
the
dowager
up
in
the
square
how
to
get
away
that
was
the
thing
that
worried
me
i
just
made
up
my
mind
to
have
a
lucid
interval
when
the
front
door
opened
and
in
walked
tom
you
mighty
cute
so
cute
you
land
us
both
behind
bars
some
day
but
you
ca
guess
who
came
in
on
our
little
family
party
yes
oh
yes
you
met
him
well
the
old
duffer
whose
watch
was
ticking
inside
my
waist
that
very
minute
yes
sir
the
same
fellow
we
spied
getting
full
at
the
little
station
in
the
country
only
he
was
a
bit
mellower
than
when
you
grabbed
his
chain
well
he
was
edward
i
almost
dropped
the
cup
when
i
saw
him
the
dowager
took
it
from
me
saying
there
dear
do
be
nervous
it
only
only
she
got
lost
it
could
be
my
daddy
the
bishop
was
that
but
it
was
her
husband
so
who
could
it
be
evening
bishop
hello
henrietta
back
so
soon
from
the
opera
roared
edward
in
a
big
husky
voice
he
had
more
since
we
saw
him
but
he
walked
straight
as
the
bishop
himself
and
he
a
dear
little
ramrod
ah
his
eyes
lit
up
at
sight
of
me
ah
miss
miss
of
course
i
met
the
young
lady
henrietta
but
hang
me
if
i
forgotten
her
name
miss
miss
murieson
lied
the
old
lady
glibly
a
a
relative
why
mummy
i
said
reproachfully
there
there
it
only
a
joke
is
it
a
joke
edward
she
demanded
laughing
uneasily
joke
he
repeated
with
a
hearty
bellow
of
laughter
best
kind
of
a
joke
i
call
it
to
find
so
pretty
a
girl
right
in
your
own
house
eh
bishop
why
does
he
call
my
father
mummy
i
could
help
it
the
fun
of
hearing
the
dowager
lie
and
knowing
the
bishop
beside
himself
with
the
pain
of
deception
was
too
much
for
me
i
could
see
she
did
dare
trust
her
edward
with
my
sad
story
ho
ho
the
bishop
that
good
no
my
dear
miss
murieson
if
this
lady
your
mother
why
i
must
be
at
least
i
ought
to
be
your
father
as
such
i
going
to
have
all
the
privileges
of
a
parent
bless
me
if
i
not
i
do
suppose
he
have
done
it
if
he
been
sober
but
there
no
telling
when
you
remember
the
reputation
the
dowager
had
given
him
but
he
got
no
further
than
to
put
his
arm
around
me
when
both
the
bishop
and
the
dowager
flew
to
the
rescue
my
but
they
were
shocked
i
could
help
wondering
what
they
have
done
if
edward
had
happened
to
see
the
bishop
in
the
same
sort
of
tableau
earlier
in
the
afternoon
but
i
got
a
lucid
interval
just
then
and
distracted
their
attention
i
stood
for
a
moment
my
head
bent
as
though
i
was
thinking
deeply
i
think
i
go
now
i
said
at
length
i
i
do
understand
exactly
how
i
got
here
i
went
on
looking
from
the
bishop
to
the
dowager
and
back
again
or
how
i
happened
to
miss
my
father
ever
so
much
obliged
to
you
and
if
you
will
give
me
my
hat
i
take
the
next
train
back
to
college
you
do
nothing
of
the
sort
said
the
dowager
promptly
my
dear
you
a
sweet
girl
that
been
studying
too
hard
you
must
go
to
my
room
and
rest
and
stay
for
dinner
do
you
care
sometimes
i
do
know
how
i
get
here
myself
edward
winked
jovially
well
i
did
while
the
dowager
back
was
turned
i
gave
him
the
littlest
one
in
return
for
his
it
made
him
drunker
than
ever
i
think
said
the
bishop
grimly
with
a
significant
glance
at
the
dowager
as
he
turned
just
then
and
saw
the
old
cock
ogling
me
the
young
lady
is
wiser
than
we
i
take
her
to
the
station
the
station
ugh
not
nance
olden
with
the
red
coat
still
on
impossible
my
dear
bishop
interrupted
the
dowager
she
ca
be
permitted
to
go
back
on
the
train
alone
why
miss
miss
murieson
i
see
you
back
all
the
way
to
the
college
door
not
at
all
not
at
all
charmed
first
we
have
dinner
or
first
i
telephone
out
there
and
tell
you
with
us
so
that
if
there
any
rule
or
anything
of
that
sort
the
telephone
this
wretched
edward
with
half
his
wits
gave
me
more
trouble
than
the
bishop
and
the
dowager
put
together
she
jumped
at
the
idea
and
left
the
room
only
to
come
back
again
to
whisper
to
me
what
name
my
dear
what
name
what
name
i
repeated
blankly
what
name
indeed
i
wonder
how
nance
olden
would
have
done
do
hurry
dear
do
perplex
yourself
she
whispered
anxiously
noting
my
bewilderment
there
plenty
of
time
and
it
makes
no
difference
not
a
particle
really
i
put
my
hand
to
my
head
i
ca
think
i
ca
think
there
one
girl
has
nervous
prostration
and
her
name
got
mixed
with
mine
and
i
ca
hush
hush
never
mind
you
shall
come
and
lie
down
in
my
room
you
stay
with
us
anyway
and
we
have
a
doctor
in
bishop
that
right
assented
the
bishop
i
go
get
him
myself
you
you
not
going
i
cried
in
dismay
it
was
real
i
hated
to
see
him
go
nonsense
it
was
edward
who
went
himself
to
telephone
for
the
doctor
and
i
saw
my
time
getting
short
but
the
bishop
had
to
go
anyway
he
looked
out
at
his
horses
shivering
in
front
of
the
house
and
the
sight
hurried
him
my
child
he
said
taking
my
hand
just
let
ramsay
take
care
of
you
do
bother
about
anything
but
just
rest
i
see
you
in
the
morning
he
went
on
noticing
that
i
kind
of
clung
to
him
well
i
did
ca
you
remember
what
i
said
to
you
in
the
carriage
that
i
wished
you
were
my
daughter
i
wish
you
were
indeed
i
do
and
that
i
could
take
you
home
with
me
and
keep
you
child
then
if
when
you
pray
will
you
pray
for
me
as
if
i
was
your
own
daughter
tom
dorgan
you
think
no
prayers
but
a
priest
are
any
good
you
bigoted
snickering
catholic
i
tell
you
if
some
day
i
cut
loose
from
you
and
start
in
over
again
it
be
the
bishop
prayers
that
do
it
the
dowager
and
i
passed
edward
in
the
ball
he
gave
me
a
look
behind
her
back
and
i
gave
him
one
to
match
it
just
practice
you
know
tom
a
girl
can
never
know
when
she
want
to
be
expert
in
these
things
she
made
me
lie
down
on
a
couch
while
she
turned
the
lamp
low
and
then
left
me
alone
in
a
big
palace
of
a
bedroom
filled
with
things
and
i
wanted
everything
i
saw
if
i
could
i
have
lifted
everything
in
sight
but
every
minute
brought
that
doctor
nearer
soon
as
i
could
be
really
sure
she
was
gone
i
got
up
and
hurrying
to
the
long
french
windows
that
opened
on
the
great
stone
piazza
i
unfastened
them
quietly
and
inch
by
inch
i
pushed
them
open
there
within
ten
feet
of
me
stood
edward
no
escape
that
way
he
saw
me
and
was
tiptoeing
heavily
toward
me
when
i
heard
the
door
click
behind
me
and
in
walked
the
dowager
back
again
i
flew
to
her
i
thought
i
heard
some
one
out
there
i
said
it
frightened
me
so
that
i
got
up
to
look
nobody
could
be
out
there
could
they
she
walked
to
the
window
and
put
her
head
out
her
lips
tightened
grimly
no
nobody
could
be
out
there
she
said
breathing
hard
but
you
might
get
nervous
just
thinking
there
might
be
we
go
to
a
room
upstairs
and
go
we
did
in
spite
of
all
i
could
plead
about
feeling
well
enough
now
to
go
alone
and
all
the
rest
of
it
how
was
i
to
get
out
of
a
second
or
window
i
began
to
think
about
the
correction
again
as
i
followed
her
upstairs
and
after
she
left
me
i
just
sat
waiting
for
the
doctor
to
come
and
send
me
there
i
did
much
care
till
i
remembered
the
bishop
i
could
almost
see
his
face
as
it
would
look
when
he
be
called
to
testify
against
me
and
i
be
standing
in
that
pen
in
the
middle
of
the
where
dan
christensen
stood
when
they
tried
him
no
i
could
bear
that
not
without
a
fight
anyway
it
was
for
the
bishop
i
got
into
this
part
of
the
scrape
i
get
out
of
it
so
he
should
know
how
bad
a
thing
a
girl
can
be
while
i
lay
thinking
it
over
the
same
maid
that
had
brought
me
the
tea
came
in
she
was
an
ugly
thin
little
thing
if
she
a
sample
of
the
maids
in
that
house
the
lot
of
them
would
take
the
kink
out
of
your
pretty
hair
thomas
dorgan
esquire
late
of
the
house
of
refuge
and
soon
of
moyamensing
do
throw
things
people
in
my
set
mine
and
the
dowager
do
she
had
been
sent
to
help
me
undress
she
said
and
make
me
comfortable
the
doctor
lived
just
around
the
corner
and
would
be
in
in
a
minute
phew
she
was
very
promising
but
she
was
my
only
chance
i
took
her
i
really
do
need
any
help
thank
you
nora
i
said
chipper
as
a
sparrow
and
remembering
the
name
the
dowager
had
called
her
by
aunt
henrietta
is
too
fussy
do
you
think
oh
of
course
you
wo
say
a
word
against
her
she
told
me
the
other
day
that
she
never
had
a
maid
so
sensible
and
too
as
her
nora
do
you
know
a
mind
to
play
a
joke
on
the
doctor
when
he
comes
you
help
me
wo
you
oh
i
know
you
will
suddenly
i
remembered
the
bill
i
took
it
out
of
my
pocket
yep
tom
that
where
it
went
i
had
to
choose
between
giving
that
skinny
maid
the
biggest
tip
she
ever
got
in
her
life
or
nance
olden
to
the
correction
you
need
swear
tom
dorgan
i
fancy
if
i
got
there
you
got
worse
no
you
bully
you
know
i
would
tell
but
the
police
sort
of
know
how
to
pair
our
kind
in
her
cap
and
apron
i
let
the
doctor
in
and
myself
out
and
i
regret
a
thing
up
there
in
the
square
except
that
lovely
red
coat
with
the
high
collar
and
the
hat
with
the
fur
on
it
i
give
tom
get
me
a
coat
like
that
and
i
marry
you
for
life
no
there
one
thing
i
could
do
better
if
it
was
to
be
done
over
again
i
could
make
that
dear
little
old
bishop
wish
harder
i
been
his
daughter
what
am
i
mooning
about
oh
nothing
there
the
watch
watch
take
it
ii
yes
tom
dorgan
and
i
ca
honestly
say
i
did
have
the
chance
but
if
my
hands
are
empty
my
head
is
full
listen
there
a
girl
i
know
with
short
brown
hair
a
nose
and
gray
eyes
rather
far
apart
you
know
her
too
well
she
ca
help
that
but
this
girl
oh
she
makes
such
a
pretty
boy
and
the
ladies
at
the
hotel
over
in
brooklyn
they
just
dote
on
her
when
she
not
only
a
boy
but
a
her
name
may
be
nancy
when
she
in
petticoats
but
in
trousers
she
nathaniel
in
short
nat
now
nat
in
blue
and
buttons
with
his
nails
kept
better
than
most
boys
with
his
curly
hair
parted
in
the
middle
and
with
a
gentle
tang
to
his
voice
that
makes
him
almost
girlish
who
would
suspect
nat
of
having
a
stolen
in
his
pocket
and
a
pretty
fair
knowledge
of
the
contents
of
almost
every
top
in
the
hotel
not
sarah
kingdon
a
widow
just
arrived
from
philadelphia
and
desperately
gone
on
young
george
moriway
also
fresh
from
philadelphia
and
desperately
gone
on
kingdon
money
the
tips
that
lady
gave
the
bad
boy
nat
i
knew
i
could
make
you
believe
it
any
other
way
that
why
i
passed
on
to
you
the
hotel
woman
you
know
girls
is
a
hotel
woman
because
she
fit
to
be
anything
else
she
lazy
and
selfish
and
little
and
shifted
all
her
legitimate
cares
on
to
the
proprietor
shoulders
she
actually
you
can
understand
and
share
my
indignation
ca
you
tom
as
you
shared
other
things
she
even
gives
over
her
black
tin
box
full
of
valuables
to
the
hotel
clerk
to
put
in
the
safe
the
coward
but
her
vanity
ah
there
where
we
get
her
such
speculators
as
you
and
myself
she
got
to
outshine
the
woman
who
sits
at
the
next
table
and
so
she
borrows
her
diamonds
from
the
clerk
wears
like
the
peacock
she
is
and
trembles
till
they
back
in
the
safe
again
in
the
meantime
she
locks
them
up
in
the
tin
box
which
she
puts
in
her
top
hides
the
key
forgets
where
she
hid
it
and
o
tom
after
searching
for
it
for
hours
and
making
herself
sick
with
anxiety
she
ties
up
her
head
in
a
wet
handkerchief
with
vinegar
on
it
and
rings
the
bell
for
the
he
comes
as
i
said
he
a
prompt
gentle
little
slight
looks
rather
young
for
his
job
but
that
very
youth
and
innocence
of
his
make
him
such
a
fellow
to
trust
nat
says
kingdon
tearfully
pressing
half
a
dollar
into
the
nice
lad
hand
i
i
lost
something
and
i
want
you
to
to
help
me
find
it
yes
says
nat
he
the
soul
of
politeness
it
must
be
here
it
must
be
in
this
room
says
the
lady
getting
wild
with
the
terror
of
losing
i
sure
positive
that
i
went
straight
to
the
and
slipped
it
in
there
and
now
i
ca
find
it
and
i
must
have
it
before
i
go
out
this
afternoon
for
for
a
very
special
reason
my
daughter
evelyn
will
be
home
and
why
do
you
look
for
it
what
is
it
i
told
you
once
my
key
a
little
flat
key
that
locks
a
box
got
she
finishes
distrustfully
have
you
looked
in
the
why
of
course
i
have
you
little
stupid
i
want
you
to
hunt
other
places
where
i
ca
easily
get
there
are
other
places
i
might
have
put
it
but
i
positive
it
was
in
the
well
i
looked
for
that
key
where
where
not
i
looked
under
the
rubbish
in
the
basket
kingdon
often
fooled
thieves
by
dropping
it
there
i
pulled
up
the
corner
of
the
carpet
and
looked
there
it
was
loose
it
had
often
been
used
for
a
i
looked
in
miss
evelyn
boot
and
in
her
ribbon
box
i
emptied
kingdon
full
powder
box
i
climbed
ladders
and
felt
along
cornices
i
looked
through
the
pockets
of
kingdon
gowns
a
clever
it
takes
to
find
a
woman
pocket
but
even
the
real
masculine
ones
among
are
half
feminine
they
had
so
much
to
do
with
women
i
rummaged
through
her
and
in
searching
a
pad
found
a
note
from
moriway
hidden
under
the
corner
i
hid
it
again
carefully
in
my
coat
pocket
a
from
moriway
to
a
woman
twenty
years
older
than
himself
a
bad
lay
tom
dorgan
but
you
need
try
it
at
first
she
watched
every
move
i
made
but
later
as
her
headache
grew
worse
she
got
desperate
so
then
i
put
my
hand
down
into
the
and
found
the
key
where
it
had
slipped
under
a
fold
of
cloth
do
you
suppose
that
woman
was
grateful
she
snatched
it
from
me
i
knew
it
was
there
i
told
you
it
was
there
if
you
had
any
sense
you
have
looked
there
first
the
boys
in
this
hotel
are
so
stupid
that
all
she
nodded
she
was
fitting
the
key
into
the
black
box
she
taken
from
the
top
drawer
nat
had
got
to
the
outside
door
when
he
heard
her
come
shrieking
after
him
nat
nat
come
back
my
diamonds
they
not
here
i
know
i
put
them
back
last
night
i
positive
i
could
swear
to
it
i
can
see
myself
putting
them
in
the
chamois
bag
and
o
my
god
where
can
they
be
this
time
they
gone
nat
could
have
told
her
but
what
the
use
he
felt
she
only
lose
again
if
she
had
so
he
let
them
lie
snug
in
his
trousers
pocket
where
he
had
put
the
chamois
bag
when
his
eyes
lit
on
it
under
the
corner
of
the
carpet
he
might
have
passed
it
over
to
her
then
but
you
see
tom
she
had
told
him
to
look
for
a
bag
it
was
a
key
she
wanted
are
so
stupid
this
time
she
followed
his
every
step
he
could
not
put
his
hand
on
the
smallest
thing
without
rousing
her
suspicion
if
he
hesitated
she
scolded
if
he
hurried
she
fumed
most
unjust
i
call
it
because
he
had
no
thought
of
stealing
just
then
come
she
said
at
last
we
go
down
and
report
it
at
the
desk
had
i
better
wait
here
and
look
again
she
looked
sharply
at
him
no
you
better
do
just
as
i
tell
you
so
down
we
went
and
we
met
moriway
there
she
telephoned
him
the
chambermaid
was
called
the
housekeeper
the
electrical
engineer
who
been
fixing
bells
that
morning
and
as
i
said
a
named
nat
who
told
how
he
just
come
on
duty
when
kingdon
bell
rang
found
her
key
and
returned
it
to
her
and
was
out
of
the
room
when
she
unlocked
the
box
that
was
all
he
knew
is
he
telling
the
truth
moriway
asked
mrs
kingdon
ye
es
i
guess
he
is
but
where
are
the
diamonds
we
must
have
them
you
know
george
she
whispered
and
then
she
turned
and
went
upstairs
leaving
moriway
to
do
the
rest
there
only
one
thing
to
do
major
he
said
to
the
proprietor
search
all
and
then
search
me
it
an
outrage
cried
the
housekeeper
search
me
if
ye
loike
growled
mccarthy
resentfully
oi
there
but
a
minute
the
lady
herself
can
tell
ye
that
katie
the
chambermaid
flushed
painfully
and
there
were
indignant
tears
in
her
eyes
which
i
tell
you
in
confidence
made
a
girl
named
nancy
uncomfortable
but
the
boy
nat
knowing
that
have
no
rights
said
nothing
but
he
thought
he
thought
tom
dorgan
a
lot
of
things
and
a
long
way
ahead
the
peppery
old
major
marched
us
all
off
to
his
private
office
not
much
girls
it
had
come
for
suddenly
the
annunciator
rang
out
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
nat
looked
at
the
bench
it
was
empty
there
was
to
be
a
ball
that
night
and
the
bells
were
going
it
over
all
the
place
number
shouted
the
clerk
at
the
desk
but
number
did
budge
his
heart
was
beating
like
a
hammer
and
the
ting
ng
ng
of
that
bell
calling
him
rang
in
his
head
like
a
song
number
yelled
the
clerk
oh
he
got
a
devil
of
a
temper
has
that
clerk
some
day
tom
when
you
love
me
very
much
go
up
to
the
hotel
and
break
his
face
for
me
boy
confound
you
ca
you
hear
he
shouted
that
time
he
caught
the
major
ear
the
one
that
was
deaf
he
looked
from
powers
black
face
to
the
bench
and
then
to
me
and
all
the
time
the
bell
kept
ringing
like
mad
git
he
said
to
the
boy
and
come
back
in
a
hurry
number
got
but
leisurely
it
would
do
for
a
to
hurry
particularly
when
he
had
such
good
cause
oh
girls
those
stone
stairs
the
servants
stairs
at
the
james
they
fierce
i
tell
you
mag
scrubbing
the
floors
at
the
cruelty
ai
so
bad
but
this
time
i
was
jolly
glad
were
allowed
in
the
elevator
for
there
were
those
diamonds
in
my
pants
pocket
and
i
must
get
rid
of
before
i
got
down
to
the
office
again
so
i
climbed
those
stairs
and
every
step
i
took
my
eye
was
searching
for
a
i
could
have
pitched
the
little
bag
out
of
a
window
but
nancy
olden
was
throwing
diamonds
to
the
birds
any
more
than
mag
here
is
likely
to
cut
off
the
braids
of
red
hair
we
used
to
play
horse
with
when
we
drove
her
about
the
cruelty
yard
one
flight
no
chance
another
everything
bare
as
stone
and
soap
could
keep
it
the
third
flight
my
knees
began
to
tremble
and
not
with
climbing
the
call
came
from
this
floor
but
i
ran
up
a
fourth
just
on
the
chance
and
there
in
a
corner
was
a
fire
hatchet
strapped
to
the
wall
behind
that
hatchet
kingdon
diamonds
might
lie
snug
till
evening
i
put
the
ends
of
my
fingers
first
in
the
little
crack
to
make
sure
the
little
bag
would
drop
to
the
floor
and
then
dived
into
my
pocket
and
and
there
behind
me
stealthily
coming
up
the
last
turn
of
the
stairs
was
george
moriway
do
you
hate
a
man
mag
that
cute
fellow
was
cuter
than
the
old
major
himself
and
had
followed
me
every
inch
of
the
way
there
something
loose
with
this
hatchet
sir
i
said
innocently
looking
down
at
him
oh
there
is
what
an
observing
little
fellow
you
are
never
mind
the
hatchet
just
tell
me
what
number
you
were
sent
to
answer
number
i
repeated
as
though
i
could
see
why
he
wanted
to
know
why
not
much
my
boy
me
sir
ai
you
mistaken
he
looked
at
me
for
full
a
minute
i
stared
him
straight
in
the
eye
a
nasty
eye
he
got
black
and
bloodshot
and
cold
and
full
of
suspicion
but
it
wavered
a
bit
at
the
end
i
may
be
he
said
slowly
but
not
about
the
number
just
you
turn
around
and
get
down
to
all
right
sir
thank
you
very
much
it
might
have
got
me
in
trouble
the
ladies
are
so
particular
about
having
the
bells
answered
quick
i
guess
you
get
in
trouble
all
right
he
said
and
stood
watching
from
where
he
stood
he
could
watch
me
every
inch
of
the
way
till
i
got
to
at
the
end
of
the
hall
kingdon
door
and
the
goods
still
on
me
tom
mind
that
my
but
kingdon
was
wrathy
when
she
saw
me

they
send
you
she
cried
why

you
keep
me
waiting
so
long

chambermaid

rung
a
dozen
times
the
whole
place

crazy
about
that
old
ball
and
no
one
can
get
decent
attention
ca
i
do
what
you
want
i
just
yearned
to
get

that
door

she
snapped

fasten

dress

the
back
we
often

said
softly

i
breathed
again

it
indecent

down
and
send
me
a
maid
she
was
just
closing
the
door
in
my
face
and
moriway
waiting
for
me
to
watch
me
down
again

of
my
coat
but
lordy
i
did
want
to
get
away
a
little
bit
i
let
her
pull
me
in
and
then
i
backed
up
against
the
door
and
shut
it

my
pocket
and
handed
it
to
her
the
poor
old
lady

a

how
old
ladies

one
at
evening
after

face
had
been
massaged
for
an
hour
and
the
manicure
girl
and
the
had
gone
was
so
bad
but
with
the
marks
of
the
morning
tears
on
her
agitated
face
with
the
blood
pounding
up
to
her
temples
where
the
hair
was
thin
and
gray
tom
dorgan
if
i
a
vain
old
fool
like
that
when
i
three
times
as
old
as
i
am

a
stone
around
my
neck
and
take
me
down
and
drop
me
into
the
nearest
water
wo
you

abominable
little
wretch
she
sobbed
i
suppose
you
told
everybody
in
the
office
how
could
i
how
could
you
she
looked
up
the
tears
on
her
flabby
flushed
cheek
i
did
know
myself
i
ca
read
writing
it
was
thin
but
she
wanted
to
believe
it
she
could
have
taken
me
in
her
arms
she
was
so
happy
there
there
she
patted
my
shoulder
and
gave
me
a
dollar
bill
i
was
a
bit
hasty
nat
it
only
a
a
little
business
matter
that
moriway
attending
to
for
me
we
we
finish
it
up
this
afternoon
i
should
like
miss
kingdon
to
know
of
it
because
because
i
never
like
to
worry
her
about
business
you
know
so
do
mention
it
when
she
comes
no
shall
i
fasten
your
dress
i
simply
had
to
stay
in
that
room
till
i
could
get
rid
of
those
diamonds
with
a
faded
old
blush
the
nicest
thing
about
her
i
ever
seen
she
turned
her
back
it
dark
i
coaxed
would
you
mind
coming
nearer
the
window
no
she
would
mind
she
backed
up
to
the
corner
like
a
gentle
little
lamb
while
i
hooked
with
one
hand
i
dropped
the
little
bag
where
the
carpet
was
still
turned
up
and
with
the
toe
of
my
shoe
spread
it
flat
again
you
real
handy
for
a
boy
she
said
pleased
thank
you
i
answered
pleased
myself
moriway
was
still
watching
me
of
course
when
i
came
out
but
i
ran
downstairs
he
following
close
and
when
the
major
got
hold
of
me
i
pulled
my
pockets
inside
out
like
a
little
man
moriway
was
there
at
the
time
i
knew
he
was
convinced
but
he
could
watch
a
all
day
long
and
the
moment
i
was
sure
his
eyes
were
off
me
i
was
ready
to
get
those
diamonds
back
again
but
not
a
call
came
all
that
afternoon
from
the
west
side
of
the
house
except
the
call
of
those
pretty
precious
things
snug
under
the
carpet
calling
calling
to
me
to
come
and
get
them
and
drop
for
good
at
last
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
there
only
one
thing
to
do
when
your
chance
wo
come
to
you
that
is
to
go
to
it
at
about
four
i
lit
out
climbed
to
the
second
story
and
there
mag
i
always
was
the
luckiest
girl
at
the
cruelty
was
i
well
there
was
suite
all
torn
up
plumbers
and
painters
in
there
and
nothing
in
the
world
to
prevent
a
boy
skinning
through
when
no
one
was
watching
out
of
the
window
and
up
the
just
outside
of
kingdon
window
i
lay
still
a
minute
i
had
seen
her
and
moriway
go
out
together
she
all
gay
with
finery
he
carrying
her
bag
the
lace
curtains
in
were
blowing
in
the
breeze
cautiously
i
parted
them
and
looked
in
everything
was
lovely
from
where
i
lay
i
reached
down
and
turned
back
the
flap
of
the
carpet
it
was
too
easy
those
darling
diamonds
seemed
just
to
leap
up
into
my
hand
in
a
moment
i
had
them
tucked
away
in
my
pants
pocket
then
down
the
and
out
through
where
i
told
the
painter
been
to
get
a
toy
the
boy
in
had
dropped
out
of
the
window
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
me
no
one
did
though
i
felt
those
diamonds
shining
like
an
through
my
very
body
i
got
downstairs
and
was
actually
outside
the
door
almost
in
the
street
and
off
to
you
when
a
girl
called
me
here
boy

this
case
she
said

you
know
who
it
was
oh

young
lady

the
girl
with
the
red
coat
and
the
hat
with
the
chinchilla
fur
how
did
they
look
oh
fairly
well
on
a
blonde
but
to
my
taste
the
last
girl
i
seen
in
the
coat
and
hat
was
handsomer
well
i
carried
her
and
followed
her
back
into
the
hotel
i
did
want
to
a
bit
though
that
coat
still
wonder
how
she
got
it
back
she
sailed
up
the
hall
and
into
the
elevator
and
i
had
to
follow
we
got
of
at
the
third
story
and
she
brought
me
right
to
the
door
of
and
then
i
knew
this
must
be
evelyn
kingdon
out
miss
she
did
expect
you
till
did
she
tell
you
that
too
bad
she
is

said

kept
busy
all
day

business
matter
and
that
i
better
not
get

till
but
i
wanted
to
get
here
in
time
for
the
wedding
i
suggested
softly

should
have
seen
her
jump

and
mr
moriway
she
turned
white
has
that
man
followed
her
here

it
for
five
at
the
church
on
the
corner
how
do

know
she
turned
on
me
suddenly
suspicious
well
i
do
know
and
i
the
only
person
in
the
house
that
does
i
do
believe
you
she
took
out
her
key
and
opened
the
door
and
i
followed
her
in
with
the
but
before
i
could
get
it
set
down
on
the
floor
she
had
swooped
on
a
letter
that
was
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
table
had
torn
it
open
and
then
with
a
cry
had
come
whirling
toward
me
where
is
this
church
come
help
me
to
get
to
it
before
five
and
i
oh
you
shall
have
anything
in
the
world
you
want
she
flew
out
into
the
hall
i
after
her
and
first
thing
you
know
we
were
down
in
the
street
around
the
corner
and
there
in
front
of
the
church
was
a
carriage
with
moriway
just
helping
kingdon
out
mother
at
that
cry
the
old
lady
knees
seemed
to
crumble
under
her
her
poor
old
painted
face
looked
out
ghastly
and
ashamed
from
her
wedding
finery
but
evelyn
in
her
red
coat
flew
to
her
and
took
her
in
her
arms
as
though
she
was
a
child
and
like
a
child
kingdon
sobbed
and
made
excuses
and
begged
to
be
forgiven
i
looked
at
moriway
it
was
all
the
pay
i
wanted
particularly
as
i
had
those
little
diamonds
you
just
in
time
miss
kingdon
he
said
uneasily
to
make
your
mother
happy
by
your
presence
at
her
wedding
i
just
in
time
moriway
to
see
that
my
mother
not
made
unhappy
by
your
presence
evelyn
kingdon
remonstrated
come
sarah
moriway
offered
his
arm
the
bride
shook
her
head
she
said
feebly
moriway
breathed
a
swear
miss
kingdon
laughed
i
come
to
take
care
of
you
you
silly
little
mother
dear
it
wo
be
mr
moriway
no
not
next
week
sighed
kingdon
in
fact
mother
changed
her
mind
moriway
she
thinks
it
ungenerous
to
accept
such
a
sacrifice
from
a
man
who
might
be
her
son
do
you
mother
well
perhaps
george
she
looked
up
from
her
shoulder
she
was
crying
all
over
that
precious
red
coat
of
mine
and
her
eyes
lit
on
me
oh
you
wicked
boy
you
told
a
lie
she
gasped
you
did
read
my
letter
i
laughed
laughed
out
loud
it
was
such
a
bully
thing
to
watch
moriway
face
but
that
was
an
unlucky
laugh
of
mine
it
turned
his
wrath
on
me
he
made
a
dive
toward
me
i
ducked
and
ran
oh
how
i
ran
but
if
he
had
slipped
on
the
curb
he
have
had
me
as
he
fell
though
he
let
out
a
yell
stop
thief
stop
thief
thief
thief
thief
may
you
never
hear
it
mag
behind
you
when
you
somebody
diamonds
in
your
pocket
it
sounds
it
sounds
the
way
the
bay
of
the
hounds
must
sound
to
the
hare
it
seems
to
fly
along
with
the
air
at
the
same
time
to
be
behind
you
at
your
side
even
in
front
of
you
i
heard
it
bellowed
in
a
dozen
different
voices
and
every
now
and
then
i
could
hear
moriway
as
i
pelted
on
that
brassy
cruel
bellow
of
his
that
made
my
heart
sick
and
then
all
at
once
i
heard
a
policeman
whistle
that
whistle
was
like
a
signal
i
saw
the
gates
of
the
correction
open
before
me
i
saw
your
nance
tom
in
a
neat
striped
dress
and
she
was
behind
bars
bars
bars
there
were
bars
everywhere
before
me
in
fact
i
felt
them
against
my
very
hands
for
in
my
mad
race
i
had
shot
up
a
blind
alley
a
street
that
ended
in
a
garden
behind
an
iron
fence
i
grabbed
the
diamonds
to
throw
them
from
me
but
i
could
i
just
could
i
jumped
the
fence
where
the
gate
was
low
and
with
that
whistle
flying
shrill
and
shriller
after
me
i
ran
to
the
house
i
might
have
jumped
from
the
of
course
i
might
but
it
was
all
fire
to
me
to
be
caught
at
the
end
is
at
least
no
worse
than
to
be
caught
at
the
beginning
anyhow
it
was
my
one
chance
and
i
took
it
as
unhesitatingly
as
a
rat
takes
a
leap
into
a
trap
to
escape
a
terrier
only
only
it
was
my
luck
that
the
trap
was
set
the
room
was
empty
i
pushed
open
a
glass
door
and
fell
over
an
open
trunk
that
stood
beside
it
it
bruised
my
knee
and
tore
my
hand
but
oh
it
was
nuts
to
me
for
it
was
a
woman
trunk
filled
with
women
things
a
skirt
a
blessed
skirt
and
not
a
striped
one
i
threw
off
the
jacket
and
i
got
into
that
dear
dress
so
quick
it
made
my
head
swim
the
jacket
was
a
bit
tight
but
i
did
button
it
and
i
just
got
a
stiff
little
hat
perched
on
my
head
when
i
heard
the
tramp
of
men
on
the
sidewalk
and
in
the
dusk
saw
the
cop
buttons
at
the
gate
caught
not
much
not
yet
i
threw
open
the
glass
doors
and
walked
out
into
the
garden
miss
omar
i
wonder
if
it
would
be
miss
omar
you
bet
i
did
take
time
to
see
who
it
was
talking
before
i
answered
of
course
i
was
miss
omar
i
was
miss
anybody
that
had
a
right
to
wear
skirts
and
be
inside
those
blessed
gates
ah
h
i
fancied
you
might
be
i
been
expecting
you
it
was
a
lazy
low
voice
with
a
laugh
in
it
and
it
came
from
a
wheeled
chair
where
a
young
man
lay
sallow
he
was
and
slim
and
long
and
helpless
you
could
see
that
by
his
white
hanging
hands
but
his
voice
it
was
what
a
woman
voice
would
be
if
she
were
a
man
it
made
you
perk
up
and
pretend
to
be
somewhere
near
its
level
it
fitted
his
soft
black
clothes
and
his
fine
clean
face
it
meant
silks
and
velvets
and
oh
all
right
tommy
dorgan
if
you
going
to
get
jealous
of
a
voice
excuse
me
mr
latimer
the
cop
came
in
as
he
spoke
moriway
following
the
rest
of
the
hounds
hung
about
there
a
thieving
from
the
hotel
that
somewhere
in
your
grounds
can
i
come
in
and
get
him
in
here
sergeant
are
you
mistaken
no
moriway
here
saw
him
jump
the
gate
not
five
minutes
since
strange
and
i
here
all
the
time
i
may
have
dozed
of
though
certainly
certainly
look
for
the
little
rascal
what
he
stolen
diamonds
tut
tut
enterprising
is
he
miss
omar
you
kindly
reach
the
bell
yonder
no
on
the
table
that
it
and
ring
for
some
one
to
take
the
officer
about
i
rang
do
you
know
what
happened
an
electric
light
strung
on
the
tree
above
the
table
shone
out
and
there
i
stood
under
it
with
moriway
eyes
full
upon
me
great
he
began
just
ring
again
latimer
voice
came
soft
as
silk
my
fingers
trembled
so
the
bell
clattered
out
of
them
and
fell
jangling
to
the
ground
but
it
rang
and
the
light
above
me
went
out
like
magic
i
fell
back
into
a
garden
chair
i
beg
your
pardon
was
moriway
the
name
i
must
have
interrupted
you
but
my
eyes
are
troubling
me
this
evening
and
i
ca
bear
the
light
miss
omar
i
thought
the
housekeeper
had
instructed
you
one
ring
means
lights
two
mean
i
want
burnett
here

comes

sergeant
mulhill

the
place

looking
for
a
thief

will
accompany
the
sergeant
moriway
thank
you
no
if
you
do
mind
i
wait
out
here
that
meant
me
i
moved
toward
the
gate
not
at
all
have
a
seat
miss
omar
sit
down
wo
you
i
sat
down
miss
omar
reads
to
me
moriway
i
an
invalid
as
you
see
dependent
on
the
good
offices
of
my
man
i
find
a
woman
voice
a
soothing
change
it
must
be
particularly
if
the
voice
is
pleasing
miss
omar
i
did
quite
catch
the
name
he
waited
but
miss
omar
had
nothing
to
say
that
minute
yes
that
the
name
you
got
it
all
right
said
latimer
an
uncommon
name
is
it
i
do
think
i
ever
heard
it
before
do
you
know
miss
omar
as
i
heard
your
voice
just
before
we
got
to
the
gate
it
sounded
singularly
boyish
to
me
latimer
does
not
find
it
so
do
you
i
said
as
sweet
as
sweet
as
i
could
coax
how
sweet
that
tom
dorgan
not
at
all
a
little
laugh
came
from
latimer
as
though
he
was
enjoying
a
joke
all
by
himself
but
moriway
jumped
with
satisfaction
he
knew
the
voice
all
right
have
you
a
brother
may
i
ask
he
leaned
over
and
looked
keenly
at
me
i
am
an
orphan
i
said
sadly
with
no
relatives
a
pitiful
position
sneered
moriway
you
look
so
much
like
a
boy
i
know
that
do
you
really
think
so
so
awfully
polite
was
latimer
to
such
a
rat
as
moriway
why
well
wait
i
ca
agree
with
you
do
you
know
i
find
miss
omar
very
feminine
of
course
short
hair
her
hair
is
short
then
typhoid
i
murmured
too
bad
moriway
sneered
yes
i
snapped
i
thought
it
was
at
the
time
my
hair
was
very
heavy
and
long
and
i
had
a
chance
to
sit
in
a
window
at
troyon
where
they
were
advertising
a
hair
tonic
and
rotten
of
course
it
was
i
no
business
to
gabble
and
just
because
you
and
your
new
job
mag
came
to
my
mind
at
that
minute
there
i
went
putting
my
foot
in
it
moriway
laughed
i
did
like
the
sound
of
his
laugh
your
reader
is
versatile
latimer
he
said
yes
latimer
smoothed
the
soft
silk
rug
that
lay
over
him
poverty
and
that
sort
of
versatility
are
often
bedfellows
eh
tell
me
moriway
these
lost
diamonds
are
yours
no
they
belong
to
a
a
friend
of
mine
mrs
kingdon
oh
the
old
lady
who
was
married
this
afternoon
to
a
young
i
could
resist
it
moriway
jumped
out
of
his
seat
she
was
not
married
he
stuttered
she
changed
her
mind
how
sensible
of
her
did
she
find
out
what
a
crook
the
fellow
was
what
was
his
name
morrison
no
middleway
i
have
heard
it
may
i
ask
miss
omar
i
did
have
to
see
his
face
his
voice
told
how
mad
with
rage
he
was
how
you
come
to
be
acquainted
with
a
matter
that
only
the
contracting
parties
could
possibly
know
of
why
they
ca
have
kept
it
very
secret
the
old
lady
and
the
young
rascal
who
was
after
her
money
for
you
see
we
both
knew
of
it
and
i
was
the
bride
and
you
certainly
were
the
groom
were
you
an
exclamation
burst
from
him
latimer
he
stormed
may
i
see
you
a
moment
alone
phew
that
meant
me
but
i
got
up
just
the
same
just
keep
your
seat
miss
omar
oh
that
silken
voice
of
latimer
moriway
i
have
absolutely
no
acquaintance
with
you
i
never
saw
you
till
i
ca
imagine
what
you
may
have
to
say
to
me
that
my
secretary
miss
omar
acts
in
that
capacity
may
not
hear
i
want
to
say
burst
from
moriway
that
she
looks
the
image
of
the
boy
nat
who
stole
kingdon
diamonds
that
the
voice
is
exactly
the
same
that
but
you
have
said
it
moriway
quite
successfully
intimated
it
i
assure
you
she
knows
of
my
of
kingdon
marriage
that
that
boy
nat
found
out
about
and
you
yourself
also
as
miss
omar
mentioned
myself
damn
it
i
moriway
the
man
she
was
going
to
marry
why
should
i
ah
h
latimer
shoulders
shook
with
a
gentle
laugh
well
moriway
gentlemen
do
swear
in
my
garden
particularly
when
ladies
are
present
shall
we
say
good
evening
here
comes
mulhill
now
nothing
sergeant
too
bad
the
rogue
escaped
but
you
catch
him
they
may
get
away
from
you
but
they
never
stay
long
do
they
good
evening
good
evening
mr
moriway
they
tramped
on
and
out
moriway
very
back
showing
his
rage
he
whispered
something
to
the
sergeant
who
turned
to
look
at
me
but
shook
his
head
and
the
gate
clanged
after
them
a
long
sigh
escaped
me
warm
is
it
latimer
leaned
forward
now
would
you
mind
ringing
again
miss
omar
i
bent
and
groped
for
the
bell
and
rang
it
twice
how
quick
you
are
to
learn
he
said
but
i
really
wanted
the
light
this
time
just
light
up
burnett
he
called
to
the
man
who
had
come
out
on
the
porch
the
electric
bulb
flashed
out
again
just
over
my
head
latimer
turned
and
looked
at
me
when
i
could
bear
it
any
longer
i
looked
defiantly
up
at
him
pardon
he
said
smiling
nice
teeth
he
has
and
clear
eyes
i
was
just
looking
for
that
boyish
resemblance
moriway
spoke
of
i
hold
to
my
first
opinion
you
very
feminine
miss
omar
will
you
read
to
me
now
if
you
please
he
pointed
to
a
big
open
book
on
the
table
beside
his
couch
i
think
if
you
do
mind
latimer
i
begin
the
reading
i
got
up
to
go
i
was
through
with
that
garden
now
but
i
do
mind
silken
voice
not
a
bit
of
it
i
turned
on
him
so
furious
i
thought
i
did
care
what
came
of
it
when
over
by
the
great
i
saw
a
man
crouching
moriway
i
sat
down
again
and
pulled
the
book
farther
toward
the
light
we
did
learn
much
poetry
at
the
cruelty
did
we
mag
but
i
know
some
now
just
the
same
when
i
began
to
read
i
heard
only
one
word
moriway
moriway
moriway
but
i
must
have
forgotten
him
after
a
time
and
the
dark
garden
with
the
light
on
only
one
spot
and
the
roses
smelling
and
latimer
lying
perfectly
still
his
face
turned
toward
me
for
i
was
reading
listen
i
bet
i
can
remember
that
part
of
it
if
i
say
it
slow
oh
thou
who
man
of
baser
earth
didst
make
and
with
paradise
devise
the
snake
for
all
the
sin
wherewith
the
face
of
man
is
blacken
man
forgiveness
give
and
take
when
all
at
once
latimer
put
his
hand
on
the
book
i
looked
up
with
a
start
the
shadow
by
the
gate
was
gone
yon
rising
moon
that
looks
for
us
again
how
oft
hereafter
will
she
wax
and
wane
how
oft
hereafter
rising
look
for
us
through
this
same
garden
and
for
one
in
vain
latimer
was
saying
it
without
the
book
and
with
a
queer
smile
that
made
me
feel
i
had
quite
caught
on
thank
you
that
will
do
he
went
on
that
is
enough
miss
he
stopped
i
waited
he
did
not
say
omar
i
looked
him
square
in
the
eye
and
then
i
had
enough
but
what
in
the
devil
did
you
make
believe
for
i
asked
he
smiled
if
ever
you
come
to
lie
on
your
back
day
and
night
year
in
and
year
out
and
know
that
never
in
your
life
will
it
be
any
different
you
may
take
pleasure
in
a
bit
of
excitement
and
and
learn
to
pity
the
under
dog
who
in
this
case
happened
to
be
a
boy
that
leaped
over
the
gate
as
though
his
heart
was
in
his
mouth
just
as
you
would
admire
the
nerve
of
the
young
lady
that
came
out
of
the
house
a
few
minutes
after
in
your
housekeeper
sunday
gown
yes
grin
torn
dorgan
you
wo
grin
long
i
put
down
the
book
and
got
up
to
go
good
night
then
and
thank
you
mr
latimer
good
night
oh
miss
he
did
say
omar
there
is
a
favor
you
might
do
me
sure
i
wondered
what
it
could
be
those
diamonds
i
got
to
have
them
you
know
to
send
them
back
to
their
owner
i
do
mind
helping
a
a
person
who
helps
himself
to
other
people
things
but
i
ca
let
him
get
away
with
his
plunder
without
being
that
kind
of
person
myself
so
why
did
i
lie
because
there
are
some
people
you
do
lie
to
tom
dorgan
do
talk
to
me
you
bully
i
savage
enough
to
have
rings
and
pins
and
a
whole
bagful
of
diamonds
and
to
haul
out
of
your
pocket
and
lay
on
the
table
there
before
him
i
wonder
he
said
slowly
as
he
put
them
away
in
his
own
pocket
what
a
man
like
me
could
do
for
a
girl
like
you
reform
her
i
snarled
show
her
how
to
get
diamonds
honestly
say
tom
let
go
in
for
bigger
game
iii
oh
mag
mag
for
heaven
sake
let
me
talk
to
you
no
do
say
anything
you
must
let
me
tell
you
no
do
call
the
other
girls
i
ca
bear
to
tell
this
to
anybody
but
you
you
know
how
i
kicked
when
tom
hit
on
latimer
as
the
place
we
were
to
scuttle
and
the
harder
i
kicked
the
stubborner
he
got
till
he
swore
he
do
the
job
without
me
if
i
would
come
along
well
this
is
the
rest
of
it
the
house
you
know
stands
at
the
end
of
the
street
if
you
could
walk
through
the
garden
with
the
iron
fence
you
come
right
down
the
bluff
on
to
the
docks
and
out
into
east
river
tom
and
i
came
up
to
it
from
the
docks
last
night
it
was
dark
and
wet
you
remember
the
mud
was
thick
on
my
trousers
nance
olden
a
boy
every
time
when
it
comes
to
doing
business
we
blow
it
all
in
tom

said
as

spend
a
week
at
the
waldorf
and
then

shriek
well

up
just
the
same
do
you
hear
me

shut
up
but
my
teeth
chattered
so
that
tom
stopped
at
the
gate
look
here
nance
are
you
going
to
flunk
say
it
now
yes
or
no
that
made
me
mad
tom
dorgan

first
time
you
went
in
for
a
thing
like
this
i
all
right
you
squeal
before
i
do
that
more
like
here
the
gate

locked
come
nance
with
a
good
strong
swing
he
boosted
me
over
handed
me
the
bag
of
tools
and
sprang
over
himself
he
looked
kind
o
handsome
and
fine
my
tom
as
he
lit
square
and
light
on
his
feet
beside
me
and
because
he
did
i
put
my
arm
in
his
and
gave
it
a
squeeze
oh
mag
it
was
so
funny
going
through
latimer
garden
there
was
the
garden
table
where
i
had
sat
reading
and
thinking
he
took
me
for
miss
omar
there
was
the
bench
where
that
beast
moriway
sat
sneering
at
me
the
wheeled
chair
was
gone
and
it
was
so
late
everything
looked
asleep
but
something
was
left
behind
that
made
me
think
i
heard
latimer
slow
silken
voice
and
made
me
feel
cheap
turned
inside
out
like
an
empty
pocket
a
dirty
ragged
pocket
with
a
seam
in
it
you
stay
here
nancy
and
watch
tom
whispered
you
whistle
once
if
a
cop
comes
inside
the
gate
but
not
before
he
inside
the
gate
do
whistle
too
soon
mind
that
nor
too
loud
i
hear
ye
all
right
and
i
whistle
just
once
if
anything
happens
then
you
run
hear
me
run
like
the
devil
tommy
well
what
nothing
all
right
i
wanted
to
say
but
you
know
tom
mag
were
you
ever
where
you
ought
to
be
at
midnight
alone
no
i
know
you
were
was
your
ugly
little
face
and
your
hair
that
saved
you
the
red
hair
we
used
to
guy
so
at
the
cruelty
i
can
see
you
now
a
thin
little
devil
with
the
tangled
hair
to
the
very
edge
of
your
ragged
skirt
yanked
in
that
first
day
to
the
cruelty
when
the
neighbors
complained
your
crying
would
let
sleep
nights
the
old
woman
had
just
locked
you
in
there
had
she
to
starve
when
she
lit
out
mothers
are
queer
ai
they
when
they
are
queer
i
never
remember
mine
yes
i
go
on
i
stood
it
all
right
for
a
time
out
there
alone
in
the
night
but
i
never
was
one
to
wait
patiently
i
ca
wait
it
is
in
me
but
there
i
had
to
stand
and
just
god
just
wait
if
i
had
waited
so
hard
at
the
very
first
i
would
given
out
so
soon
but
i
stood
so
still
and
listened
so
terribly
hard
that
the
trees
began
to
whisper
and
the
bushes
to
crack
and
creep
i
heard
things
in
my
head
and
ears
that
were
sounding
anywhere
else
and
all
of
a
sudden
tramp
tramp
tramp
i
heard
the
cop
footsteps
he
stopped
over
there
by
the
swinging
electric
light
above
the
gate
i
crouched
down
behind
the
iron
bench
and
my
coat
caught
a
twig
on
a
bush
and
its
crack
ck
was
like
a
yell
i
thought
i
die
i
thought
i
scream
i
thought
i
run
i
thought
i
faint
but
i
did
for
there
asleep
on
a
rug
that
some
one
had
forgotten
to
take
in
was
the
house
cat
i
gave
her
a
quick
slap
and
she
flew
out
and
across
the
path
like
a
flash
the
cop
watched
her
his
hand
on
the
gate
and
passed
on
mag
monahan
if
tom
had
come
out
that
minute
without
a
bean
and
gone
home
with
me
i
been
so
relieved
i
never
have
tried
again
but
he
did
come
nothing
happened
nights
and
nights
and
nights
went
by
and
the
stillness
began
to
sound
again
my
throat
went
choking
mad
i
began
to
shiver
and
i
reached
for
the
rug
the
cat
had
lain
on
funny
how
some
things
strike
you
this
was
latimer
rug
i
had
noticed
it
that
evening
a
warm
soft
mottled
green
that
looked
like
silk
and
fur
mixed
i
could
see
the
way
his
long
white
hands
looked
on
it
and
as
i
touched
it
i
could
hear
his
voice
oh
thou
who
man
of
baser
earth
didst
make
and
with
paradise
devise
the
snake
for
all
the
sin
wherewith
the
face
of
man
is
blacken
man
forgiveness
give
and
take
ever
hear
a
man
like
that
say
a
thing
like
that
no
well
it
different
it
as
if
the
river
had
spoken
or
a
tree
it
so
so
different
that
saved
me
that
verse
that
i
remembered
i
said
it
over
and
over
and
over
again
to
myself
i
fitted
it
to
the
ferry
whistles
on
the
bay
to
the
cop
steps
as
they
passed
again
to
the
roar
of
the
and
the
jangling
of
the
surface
cars
and
right
in
the
middle
of
it
every
drop
of
blood
in
my
body
seemed
to
leak
out
of
me
and
then
come
rushing
back
to
my
head
i
heard
whistle
oh
it
easy
to
say
run
and
i
really
meant
it
when
i
promised
tom
but
you
see
i
had
heard
that
whistle
then
when
it
came
it
changed
everything
it
set
the
devil
in
me
loose
i
felt
as
if
the
world
was
tearing
something
of
mine
away
from
me
stand
for
it
not
nance
olden
i
did
run
but
it
was
toward
the
house
that
whistle
may
have
meant
go
to
me
it
yelled
come
i
got
in
through
the
window
tom
had
left
open
the
place
was
still
quiet
nobody
inside
had
heard
that
whistle
so
far
as
i
could
tell
i
crept
along
the
carpets
were
thick
and
soft
and
silky
as
the
rug
had
my
hands
buried
in
to
keep
warm
along
a
long
hall
and
through
a
great
room
whose
walls
were
thick
with
books
i
was
making
for
a
light
i
could
see
at
the
back
of
the
house
that
where
tom
dorgan
must
be
and
where
i
must
be
to
find
out
to
know
with
my
hands
out
in
front
of
me
i
hurried
but
softly
and
just
as
i
had
reached
the
portieres
below
which
the
light
streamed
my
arms
closed
about
a
thing
cold
as
marble
naked
i
thought
it
was
a
dead
body
upright
there
and
with
a
cry
i
pitched
forward
through
the
curtains
into
the
lighted
room
nance
you
devil
you
recognize
it
yep
it
was
tom
big
tom
dorgan
at
the
foot
of
latimer
bed
his
hands
above
his
head
and
latimer
gun
aimed
right
at
his
heart
think
of
the
pluck
of
that
cripple
will
you
his
eyes
turned
on
me
for
just
a
second
and
then
fixed
themselves
again
on
tom
but
his
voice
went
straight
at
me
all
right
you
are
something
of
a
thankless
devil
i
must
admit
miss
omar
he
said
i
did
say
anything
you
do
say
things
in
answer
to
things
like
that
you
feel
ashamed
what
do
i
care
for
a
man
with
a
voice
like
that
but
you
should
have
heard
how
tom
growl
sounded
after
it
why
the
hell
did
you
light
out
i
could
tom
i
just
could
i
sobbed
there
seems
invariably
to
be
a
misunderstanding
of
signals
where
miss
omar
is
concerned
also
a
disposition
to
use
strong
language
in
the
lady
presence
do
you
young
man
do
you
call
me
miss
omar
i
blazed
stamping
my
foot
he
laughed
a
contemptuous
laugh
i
could
have
killed
him
then
i
hated
him
so
at
least
i
thought
i
could
but
just
then
tom
sent
a
spark
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
to
me
that
meant
it
meant
you
know
mag
what
it
would
have
meant
to
latimer
if
i
had
done
what
tom
eye
said
i
thought
at
first
i
had
done
it
it
passed
through
my
mind
so
quick
the
sweet
words
i
say
the
move
i
make
the
quick
of
the
pistol
and
then
it
was
that
that
sight
of
tom
big
tom
dorgan
with
rage
in
his
heart
and
death
in
his
hand
leaping
on
that
cripple
body
it
made
me
sick
i
stood
there
gasping
stood
a
moment
too
long
for
the
curtains
were
pushed
aside
and
burnett
latimer
servant
and
the
cop
came
in
tom
did
fight
he
no
fool
to
waste
himself
but
i
well
never
mind
about
me
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
crazy
white
face
on
a
boy
body
in
the
great
glass
opposite
and
heard
my
own
voice
break
into
something
i
never
heard
before
tom
stood
at
last
with
the
handcuffs
on
it
your
own
fault
you
damned
little
chump
he
said
to
me
as
they
went
out
you
lie
mag
monahan
he

such
thing
he
may
be
a
hard
man
to
live
with
but
he
mine

tom

tom
what
latimer
well
do
you
know
it
funny
about
him
he
told
the
cop
that
peached
peached
on
tom
so
they
went
off
without
me
why
that
what
he
said
himself
when
we
were
alone
in
order
to
insure
for
myself
another
of
your
most
interesting
visits
i
suppose
miss
not
omar
all
right
tell
me
can
i
do
nothing
for
you
are
you
sick
of
this
sort
of
life
get
tom
out
of
jail
he
shook
his
head
i
too
good
a
friend
of
yours
to
do
you
such
a
turn
i
do
want
any
friend
that
is
tom
he
threw
the
pistol
from
him
and
pulled
himself
up
till
he
sat
looking
at
me
in
heaven
name
what
can
you
see
in
a
fellow
like
that
what
that
to
you
i
turned
to
go
to
me
things
of
that
sort
are
nothing
of
course
to
me
me
that
pot
he
marr
in
making
but
tell
me
can
a
girl
like
you
tell
the
truth
what
made
you
hesitate
when
that
fellow
told
you
with
his
eyes
to
murder
me
how
did
you
know
how
the
glass
see
over
yonder
i
could
watch
every
expression
on
both
your
faces
what
was
it
what
was
it
child
that
made
you
oh
if
you
owe
me
a
single
of
gratitude
tell
me
the
truth
you
said
it
yourself
what
that
line
we
read
the
other
night
about
luckless
pot
his
face
went
gray
and
he
fell
back
on
his
pillows
the
strenuous
life
we
been
leading
him
tom
and
i
was
too
much
for
him
i
guess
do
you
know
i
really
felt
sorry
i
said
it
but
he
is
a
cripple
did
he
expect
me
to
say
he
was
big
and
strong
and
dashing
like
tom
i
left
him
there
and
got
out
and
away
but
do
you
know
what
i
saw
mag
beside
his
bed
just
as
burnett
came
to
put
me
out
my
old
blue
coat
with
the
buttons
the
coat
i
left
in
the
housekeeper
room
when
i
borrowed
her
sunday
rig
the
coat
was
hanging
over
a
chair
and
right
by
it
on
a
table
was
that
big
book
with
a
picture
covering
every
page
still
open
at
that
verse
about
through
this
same
garden
and
for
one
in
vain
iv
no
no
no
no
more
whining
from
nance
olden
listen
to
what
i
got
to
tell
you
mag
listen
you
know
where
i
was
coming
from
yesterday
when
i
passed
window
and
grinned
up
at
you
sitting
there
framed
in
bottles
of
hair
tonic
with
all
that
red
wig
of
yours
streaming
about
you
yep
from
that
little
lawyer
office
i
was
glum
as
mud
i
felt
as
though
tom
and
myself
were
both
flies
caught
by
the
leg
he
by
the
law
and
i
by
the
lawyer
in
a
sticky
mess
and
the
more
we
flapped
our
wings
and
struggled
and
pulled
the
more
we
hurt
and
tore
ourselves
and
the
sooner
we
have
to
give
it
up
oh
that
little
lawyer
that
lives
on
the
tom
dorgans
and
the
nance
oldens
who
do
know
which
way
to
turn
to
get
the
money
he
looks
at
me
out
of
his
red
little
eyes
and
measures
in
dollars
what
i
do
for
tom
and
then
he
sets
his
price
a
notch
higher
than
that
when
i
passed
the
big
department
store
next
to
troyon
i
was
thinking
of
this
and
i
turned
in
there
just
aching
for
some
of
the
boodle
that
flaunts
itself
in
a
poor
girl
face
when
she
desperate
from
every
silk
and
satin
rag
from
every
lace
and
jewel
in
the
place
the
funny
part
of
it
is
that
i
did
want
it
for
myself
but
for
tom
my
soul
mag
though
i
would
have
filled
my
arms
with
everything
i
saw
i
would
have
put
on
one
thing
of
all
the
duds
just
hiked
off
to
soak
and
pay
the
lawyer
i
might
have
been
as
old
and
ugly
and
rich
as
the
woman
opposite
me
who
was
turning
over
laces
on
the
middle
counter
for
all
these
things
meant
to
me
with
tom
in
jail
i
was
thinking
this
as
i
looked
at
her
when
all
at
once
i
saw
you
know
it
takes
a
pretty
quick
touch
sharp
eyes
and
good
nerve
to
get
away
with
the
goods
in
a
big
shop
like
that
or
it
takes
something
altogether
different
it
was
the
different
way
she
did
it
she
took
up
the
piece
of
lace
it
was
a
big
collar
fine
like
a
cobweb
picture
in
threads
you
can
guess
what
it
must
have
been
worth
if
that
old
sinner
mother
douty
gave
me
fifteen
dollars
for
it
she
took
it
up
in
a
quick
eager
way
as
though
she
found
just
what
she
wanted
then
she
took
out
a
lace
sample
from
her
purse
and
held
them
both
up
close
to
her
blinky
little
eyes
looking
at
it
through
a
gold
lorgnette
with
emeralds
in
the
handle
pulling
it
and
feeling
it
with
the
air
of
one
who
knows
a
fine
thing
when
she
sees
it
and
just
what
makes
it
fine
then
she
rustled
off
to
the
door
to
examine
it
closely
in
the
light
and
mag
monahan
she
walked
right
out
with
it
at
least
she
got
beyond
the
inner
doors
when
i
tapped
her
on
the
shoulder
i
beg
pardon
madam
my
best
style
mag
she
pulled
herself
up
haughtily
and
blinked
at
me
she
was
a
little
thin
mummy
of
a
woman
just
wrapped
away
in
silks
and
velvets
but
on
the
inside
of
that
nervous
little
old
body
of
hers
there
must
have
been
some
spring
of
good
material
that
was
all
unwound
yet
she
stood
blinking
at
me
without
a
word
that
lace
you
have
paid
for
it
i
said
her
eyes
fell
from
my
face
to
the
collar
she
held
in
her
hand
her
yellow
face
grew
ghastly
oh
mercy
you
you
do
i
am
a
detective
for
the
store
and
but
sh
we
do
like
any
noise
made
about
these
things
and
you
yourself
would
enjoy
do
you
know
who
i
am
young
woman
she
fumbled
in
her
satchel
and
passed
a
card
to
me
glory
be
guess
mag
oh
you
never
guess
you
dear
old
mag
besides
you
have
got
the
acquaintance
in
high
society
that
nance
olden
can
boast
mills
van
wagenen
oh
mag
shame
on
you
not
to
know
the
name
even
of
the
bishop
of
the
great
state
of
yes
the
lean
short
little
bishop
with
a
little
white
beard
and
the
softest
eye
and
the
softest
heart
and
my
very
own
bishop
nancy
olden
bishop
and
this
was
his
wife
tut
tut
mag
of
course
not
a
bishop
wife
may
be
a
kleptomaniac
it
only
cruelty
girls
that
really
steal
from
stores
i
met
the
bishop
van
wagenen
i
did
say
how
she
would
appreciate
that
story
and
he
was
once
very
kind
to
me
but
he
would
be
the
first
to
tell
me
to
do
my
duty
now
i
do
it
as
quietly
as
i
can
for
his
sake
but
you
must
come
with
me
or
i
must
arrest
she
put
up
a
shaking
hand
dear
little
old
guy
do
do
say
it
it
all
a
mistake
which
can
be
rectified
in
a
moment
i
been
trying
to
match
this
piece
of
lace
for
years
i
got
it
at
malta
when
when
mills
and
i
on
our
honeymoon
when
i
saw
it
there
on
the
counter
i
was
so
delighted
i
never
thought
i
intended
taking
it
to
the
light
to
be
sure
the
pattern
was
the
same
my
eyesight
is
so
wretched
and
when
you
spoke
to
me
it
was
the
first
inkling
i
had
that
i
had
really
taken
it
without
paying
you
certainly
understand
she
pleaded
in
agitation
i
have
no
need
to
steal
you
must
know
that
oh
that
i
would
that
i
could
if
you
will
just
let
me
pay
you
here
now
mag
monahan
do
you
get
to
sneering
she
was
straight
right
on
the
level
all
right
you
could
listen
to
that
cracked
little
voice
of
hers
a
minute
without
being
sure
of
it
i
was
just
about
to
permit
her
graciously
to
pay
me
the
money
for
my
friend
the
dear
bishop
sake
of
course
when
a
big
happened
to
catch
sight
of
us
if
you
come
with
me
van
wagenen
to
a
arrange
your
collar
for
you
i
said
very
loud
and
then
in
a
whisper
of
course
i
understand
but
the
thing
may
look
different
to
other
people
and
that
big
there
gets
a
commission
from
the
newspapers
every
time
he
tells
them
she
gave
a
squawk
for
all
the
world
like
a
little
hen
scuttling
out
of
a
yellow
dog
way
and
we
took
the
elevator
to
the
second
floor
the
minute
i
closed
the
door
of
the
little
she
held
out
the
lace
to
me
i
have
changed
my
mind
she
said
and
shall
give
you
the
lace
back
i
will
not
keep
it
i
can
not
i
can
not
bear
the
sight
of
it
it
terrifies
me
and
shocks
me
i
can
take
no
pleasure
in
it
besides
besides
it
will
be
discipline
for
me
to
do
without
it
now
that
i
have
found
it
after
all
these
years
every
day
i
shall
look
at
the
place
in
my
collection
which
it
would
have
occupied
and
i
shall
say
to
myself
van
wagenen
take
warning
see
to
what
terrible
straits
a
worldly
passion
may
bring
one
what
unconscious
greed
may
do
i
shall
give
the
money
to
mills
for
charity
and
i
will
never
never
fill
that
place
in
my
collection
what
good
will
that
do
i
asked
puzzled
while
i
folded
the
collar
up
into
a
very
small
package
you
mean
that
i
ought
to
submit
to
the
exposure
that
i
deserve
the
lesson
and
the
punishment
not
for
stealing
but
for
being
absorbed
in
worldly
things
perhaps
you
are
right
it
certainly
shows
that
you
have
at
some
time
been
under
mills
spiritual
care
my
dear
i
wonder
if
he
would
insist
whether
i
ought
yes
i
suppose
he
would
oh
a
saleswoman
head
was
thrust
in
the
door
excuse
me
she
said
i
thought
the
room
was
empty
we
just
finished
trying
on
i
said
sweetly
do
go
the
bishop
wife
turned
to
her
her
little
fluttering
hands
held
out
appealingly
and
do
not
misunderstand
me
the
thing
may
seem
wrong
in
your
eyes
as
this
young
woman
says
but
if
you
will
listen
patiently
to
my
explanations
i
am
sure
you
will
see
that
it
was
a
mere
eager
the
fault
of
hardly
the
sin
of
covetousness
and
surely
not
a
crime
i
am
making
this
confession
the
tender
conscience
of
the
dear
blameless
little
soul
she
was
actually
giving
herself
away
worse
she
was
giving
me
away
too
but
i
could
stand
that
i
saw
the
saleswoman
puzzled
face
she
was
a
tall
woman
with
a
big
bust
big
hips
and
the
big
head
all
right
and
she
wore
her
black
rig
for
all
the
world
like
a
cruelty
girl
who
had
stolen
the
matron
skirt
to
play
lady
in
i
got
behind
little
bishop
and
looking
out
over
her
head
i
tapped
my
forehead
significantly
the
saleswoman
tumbled
that
was
all
right
but
so
did
the
wife
for
she
turned
and
caught
me
at
it
you
shall
not
save
me
from
myself
and
what
i
deserve
she
cried
i
am
perfectly
sane
and
you
know
it
and
you
are
doing
me
no
favor
in
trying
to
create
the
contrary
impression
i
demand
an
an
interview
with
the
manager
i
interrupted
i
sure
van
wagenen
can
see
the
manager
just
go
with
the
lady
van
wagenen
and
i
follow
with
the
goods
she
did
it
meek
as
a
lamb
talking
all
the
time
but
never
beginning
at
the
beginning
luckily
for
me
so
that
i
had
time
to
slip
from
one
to
the
next
with
the
lace
up
my
sleeve
out
to
the
elevator
and
down
into
the
street
d
know
what
heaven
must
be
mag
a
place
where
you
always
get
away
with
the
swag
and
where
it
always
just
the
minute
after
you
made
a
killing
cocky
well
i
should
say
i
was
i
was
drunk
enough
with
success
to
take
big
chances
and
just
while
i
was
wishing
for
something
really
big
to
tackle
it
came
along
in
the
shape
of
that
big
he
was
without
a
hat
and
his
eyes
looked
fifty
ways
at
once
but
you
got
to
look
if
you
want
to
catch
nance
olden
i
ran
up
the
stairs
of
the
first
and
rang
the
bell
and
as
i
sailed
up
in
the
elevator
i
saw
the
big
hurry
past
he
lost
the
scent
the
boy
let
me
off
at
the
top
floor
and
after
the
elevator
had
gone
down
i
walked
up
to
the
roof
it
was
fine
up
there
so
still
and
high
with
the
lights
coming
out
down
in
the
town
and
i
took
out
my
pretty
lace
collar
and
put
it
around
my
neck
wishing
i
could
keep
it
and
wishing
that
i
had
at
least
a
glass
to
see
myself
in
it
just
once
when
my
eye
caught
the
window
of
the
next
house
it
would
do
for
a
mirror
all
right
for
the
dark
green
shade
was
down
but
at
sight
of
the
shade
blowing
in
the
wind
i
forgot
all
about
the
collar
it
this
way
mag
when
they
press
you
too
far
and
that
little
rat
of
a
lawyer
had
got
me
most
to
the
wall
i
looked
at
the
window
measuring
the
little
climb
it
would
be
for
me
to
get
to
it
the
house
next
door
was
just
one
story
higher
than
the
one
where
i
was
so
its
top
story
was
on
a
level
with
the
roof
nearly
where
i
stood
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
get
what
would
let
tom
off
easy
or
break
into
jail
myself
and
so
i
did
care
much
what
i
might
fall
into
through
that
window
and
perhaps
because
i
did
care
i
slipped
into
a
dark
hall
and
not
a
thing
stirred
not
a
footstep
creaked
i
felt
like
the
princess
princess
nancy
olden
come
to
wake
the
sleeping
beauty
some
dude
it
be
that
would
have
curly
hair
like
tom
dorgan
and
would
wear
clothes
like
my
friend
latimer
over
in
brooklyn
can
you
see
me
there
standing
on
one
leg
like
a
stork
ready
to
lie
or
to
fly
at
the
first
sound
well
the
first
sound
did
come
neither
did
the
second
in
fact
none
of
came
unless
i
made
myself
softly
as
molly
goes
when
the
baby
just
dropped
off
to
sleep
i
walked
toward
an
open
door
it
was
a
parlor
smelly
with
tobacco
and
with
lots
of
papers
and
books
around
and
nary
a
nor
any
other
kind
i
tried
the
door
of
a
room
next
to
it
a
bedroom
but
no
beauty
silly
do
you
tumble
yet
it
was
a
bachelor
apartment
and
the
bachelor
beauty
was
out
and
princess
nancy
had
the
place
all
to
herself
i
suppose
i
really
ought
to
have
left
my
card
or
he
would
know
who
had
waked
him
but
i
had
intended
to
go
calling
when
i
left
home
so
i
thought
i
look
for
one
of
his
as
a
souvenir
and
anything
else
of
his
i
could
make
use
of
there
were
shirts
i
liked
for
tom
dandy
colored
ones
and
suits
with
checks
in
and
without
but
i
wanted
something
easy
and
small
and
flat
made
of
crackly
printed
yellow
or
green
paper
with
numbers
on
it
how
did
i
know
he
had
anything
like
that
why
mag
mag
monahan

would
think
you
belonged
to
the
bishop

you
so
simple
i
had
to
turn
on
the
electric
light
after
a
bit
it
got
so
dark
and
i
do
like
light
in
other
people
houses

there
was
nothing
in
the
bedroom
except
some
pearl
studs

got
those
and
then
went
back
to
the
parlor
the
desk
caught
my
eye
oh

had
the
loveliest
pictures
on
it
pictures
of
swell
actresses
and
dancers

was
mahogany
with
lots
of
little
drawers
and
two
curvy
side
boxes
i
pulled
open
all
the
drawers
they
were
full
of
papers
all
right
but
they
were
printed
cut
from
newspapers
and
all
about
theaters
you
ca
feed
things
like
this
nance
to
that
shark
of
a
lawyer
i
said
to
myself
pushing
the
box
on
the
side
impatiently
and
then
i
giggled
outright
why
just
i
had
pushed
that
side
box
till
it
swung
aside
on
hinges
i
did
know
about
and
there
in
a
little
secret
nest
was
a
pile
of
those
same
crisp
crinkly
paper
things
i
been
looking
for
three
hundred
and
ten
dollars
mag
monahan

hundred
and
ten

i
turned
the
bills

leaked
out
of
my
hand
on
to
the
floor
the
bachelor
beauty
had
come
home
mag
and
nabbed
the
poor
princess
instead
of
her
catching
him
napping
he
was
a
beauty
either
a
big
stout
fellow
with
a
black
mustache
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
held
me
tight
but
the
look
in
his
eyes
behind
his
glasses
held
me
tighter
i
threw
out
my
arms
over
the
desk
and
hid
my
face
caught
nancy
olden
with
her
hands
dripping
and
not
a
lie
in
her
smart
mouth
he
picked
up
the
bills
i
had
dropped
counted
them
and
put
them
in
his
pocket
then
he
unhooked
a
telephone
and
lifted
the
stand
from
his
desk
hello
spring
please
hello
chief
office

is
obermuller
standard

my
apartments

the
bronsonia

on
the
corner
hold
him
till
you
come

rather
he
put
down

i
pulled
the
pearl
studs
out
of
my
pocket
you
might
as
well
take
these
too
i
said
so
thoughtful
of
you
seeing
that
you
be
searched
but
i
take
anyway
you
intended
them
for
him
you
did
get
anything
else
i
shook
my
head
as
i
lay
there
hum
it
was
half
a
laugh
and
half
a
sneer
i
hated
him
for
it
as
he
sat
leaning
back
on
the
back
legs
of
his
chair
his
thumbs
in
his
i
felt
his
eyes
those
smart
keen
eyes
burning
into
my
miserable
head
i
thought
of
the
lawyer
and
the
deal
he
give
poor
tom
and
all
at
once
you
have
sniffled
yourself
mag
monahan
there
i
was
caught

cop
be
after
me
in
five
minutes
with
tom
jugged
and
me
in
stripes
it
was
very
jolly
and
i
lost
my
nerve
ashamed
huh
he
said
lightly
i
nodded
i
was
ashamed
pity
you
did
get
ashamed
before
you
broke
in
here
what
the
devil
was
there
to
be
ashamed
of
the
sting
in
his
voice
had
cured
me
i
never
was
a
weeper
i
sat
up
my
face
blazing
and
stared
at
him
he
got
me
to
hand
over
to
the
cop
but
he
had
got
me
to
sneer
at
i
saw
by
the
look
he
gave
me
that
he
had
really
seen
me
till
then
well
he
answered
what
the
devil
is
there
to
be
ashamed
of
now
of
being
caught
that
what
oh
he
tilted
back
again
on
his
chair
and
laughed
softly
then
you
not
ashamed
of
your
profession
are
you
of
yours
well
there
a
slight
difference
not
much
whatever
it
may
be
it
your
graft
it
everybody
to
take
all
he
can
get
and
keep
out
of
jail
that
mine
too
but
you
see
i
keep
out
of
jail
i
see
you
not
there

think

need
worry
about
that
i
keep
out
thank
you
imprisonment
for
debt

go
nowadays
debt
i
a
theatrical
manager
my
girl
and
i
not
on
the
inside
which
is
another
way
of
saying
that
a
man
who
ca
swim
has
fallen
overboard
and
when
you
do
go
down
a
little
less
exultation
my
dear
or
i
might
suppose
you
be
glad
when
i
do
well
when
you
know
yourself
going
down
for
the
last
time
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
wo
grasp
at
a
straw
like
like
this
i
nodded
toward
the
open
window
and
the
desk
with
all
its
papers
tumbling
out
not
much
he
shook
his
head
and
bit
the
end
of
a
cigar
with
sharp
white
teeth
it
a
fool
graft
i
and
i
admire
fools
he
lit
his
cigar
and
puffed
a
minute
taking
out
his
watch
to
look
at
it
as
as
though
we
were
waiting
he
and
i
to
go
to
supper
together
oh
how
i
hated
him
honesty
is
the
best
policy
he
went
on
it
the
only
one
the
vain
fool
that
gets
it
into
his
head
or
shall
i
say
her
head
no
well
no
offense
i
assure
you
his
head
then
that
he
smarter
than
a
world
full
of
experience
ought
to
be
put
in
jail
for
his
own
protection
he
too
big
a
jay
to
be
left
out
of
doors
for
five
thousand
years
more
or
less
the
world
has
been
putting
people
like
him
behind
bars
where
they
ca
make
asses
of
themselves
yet
each
year
and
every
day
and
every
hour
a
new
ninny
is
born
who
fancies
he
cleverer
than
all
his
predecessors
put
together
talk
about
suckers
why
they
giants
of
intellect
compared
to
the
mentally
that
five
thousand
years
of
experience
ca
teach
when
the
turn
comes
he
hops
skips
and
jumps
into
the
ring
with
the
old
old
gag
he
thinks
it
new
because
he
himself
is
so
fresh
and
green
i
am
again
he
yells
fellow
that
do
you
up
others
have
tried
it
they
dead
in
jail
or
under
but
me
just
watch
me
we
do
and
after
a
little
we
put
him
with
his
mates
and
a
keeper
in
a
barred
kindergarten
where
fools
that
ca
learn
little
moral
cripples
of
both
sexes
my
dear
belong
bah
he
puffed
out
the
smoke
throwing
his
head
back
in
a
cloud
toward
the
ceiling
i
sprang
from
my
seat
and
faced
him
i
was
tingling
all
through
i
did
care
a
rap
what
became
of
me
for
just
that
minute
i
forgot
about
tom
i
prayed
that
the
cop
would
come
for
a
minute
yet
but
only
that
i
might
answer
him
you
mighty
smart
ai
you
you
can
sit
back
here
and
sneer
at
me
ca
you
and
feel
so
big
and
smart
and
triumphant
what
you
done
but
catch
a
girl
at
her
first
bungling
job
it
makes
you
feel
awfully
cocky
do
it
a
big
man
am
i
bah
i
blew
the
smoke
up
toward
the
ceiling
from
my
mouth
with
just
that
satisfied
gall
that
he
had
had
or
rather
i
pretended
to
he
let
down
the
front
legs
of
his
chair
and
began
to
stare
at
me
and
you
do
know
it
all
mr
manager
not
you
your
do
jump
into
the
ring
because
he
so
full
of
fun
he
ca
stay
out
he
goes
in
for
the
same
reason
the
real
clown
does
because
he
gets
hungry
and
thirsty
and
sleepy
and
tired
like
other
men
and
he
got
to
fill
his
stomach
and
cover
his
back
and
get
a
place
to
sleep
and
because
your
kind
gets
too
much
that
my
kind
gets
so
little
it
has
to
piece
it
out
with
this
sort
of
thing
no
you
do
know
it
quite
all
there
a
girl
named
nancy
olden
that
could
tell
you
a
lot
smart
as
you
are
she
could
show
you
the
inside
of
the
cruelty
where
she
was
put
so
young
she
never
knew
that
children
had
mothers
and
fathers
till
a
girl
named
mag
monahan
told
her
and
then
she
was
mighty
glad
she
had
any
she
thought
that
all
little
girls
were
bloodless
and
dirty
and
all
little
boys
were
filthy
and
had
black
purple
marks
where
their
fathers
had
tried
to
gouge
out
their
eyes
she
thought
all
women
were
like
the
matron
who
came
with
a
visitor
up
to
the
bare
room
where
we
played
without
toys
the
new
dirty
ones
of
us
and
the
old
clean
healing
ones
of
us
and
said
chicks
is
a
lady
who
come
to
see
you
tell
her
how
happy
you
are
here
then
mag
freckled
little
face
her
finger
in
her
mouth
looked
up
like
this
she
was
always
afraid
it
might
be
her
mother
come
for
her
and
the
crippled
boy
jerked
himself
this
way
i
used
to
mimic
him
and
laugh
with
the
rest
of
them
over
the
bare
floor
he
always
hoped
for
a
penny
sometimes
he
even
got
it
and
the
boy
with
the
gouged
eye
he
would
hold
his
pants
up
like
this
he
had
just
come
in
and
there
was
nothing
to
fit
him
and
he
put
his
other
hand
over
his
bad
eye
and
blink
up
at
her
like
this
and
the
littlest
boy
oh
ha
ha
ha
you
ought
have
seen
that
littlest
boy
he
was
in
skirts
an
old
dress
they
given
me
to
wear
the
first
day
i
came
there
were
no
pants
small
enough
for
him
he
back
up
into
the
corner
and
hide
his
face
like
this
and
peep
over
his
shoulder
he
had
a
squint
that
way
that
made
his
face
so
funny
see
it
makes
you
laugh
yourself
but
his
body
my
god
it
was
blue
with
welts
and
me
i
put
the
baby
down
that
been
left
on
the
of
the
cruelty
and
i
waltz
up
to
the
lady
the
nice
patronizing
rich
lady
with
her
handkerchief
to
her
nose
and
her
lorgnette
to
her
eyes
see
like
this
i
knew
just
what
graft
would
work
her
i
knew
what
she
wanted
there
i
learned
so
i
make
her
a
curtsy
like
this
and
in
the
piousest
i
there
was
a
heavy
step
out
in
the
hall
it
was
the
policeman
forgot
while
i
was
talking
i
was
back
back
in
the
empty
garret
at
the
top
of
the
cruelty
i
could
smell
the
smell
of
the
poor
the
dirty
weak
sick
poor
i
could
taste
the
porridge
in
the
thick
little
bowls
like
those
in
the
bear
story
molly
tells
her
kid
i
could
hear
the
stifled
sobs
that
wise
poor
children
give
quiet
ones
so
not
be
beaten
again
i
could
feel
the
night
when
strange
deserted
tortured
babies
lie
for
the
first
time
each
in
his
small
white
cot
the
new
ones
waking
the
old
with
their
cries
in
a
nightmare
of
what
had
happened
before
they
got
to
the
cruelty
i
could
see
the
world
barred
over
as
i
saw
it
first
through
the
cruelty
barred
windows
and
as
i
must
see
it
again
now
that
you
see
you
do
know
it
quite
all
yet
mr
manager
i
spat
it
out
at
him
and
then
walked
to
the
cop

hands
ready
for
the
bracelets
but
there
one
thing
i
do
know
he

big
fellow

on
his
feet

a
minute

was
up
and
between
me
and
the
cop
and
there
is
a
theatrical
man

it
sooner
and
develop
it
better

got
it
girl

got
it
officer

that
rose
diamond
if
you
could
only
see
it
mag
you
sympathize
with
me
and
understand
why
my
fingers
just
itched
for
it
the
first
night
i
saw
her
come
on
my
soul
mag
the
sight
of
it
blazing
on
her
neck
dazzled
me
so
that
it
shut
out
all
the
staring
audience
that
first
night
and
i
even
forgot
to
have
stage
fright
what
doped
you
olden
obermuller
asked
when
the
curtain
went
down
and
we
all
hurried
to
the
wings
i
was
in
the
black
dress
with
the
apron
and
i
looked
up
at
him
still
dazed
by
the
shine
of
that
diamond
and
my
longing
for
it
you
almost
kill
with
your
own
hands
for
a
diamond
like
that
mag
doped
why
what
did
i
do
i
asked
him
that
just
it
he
said
looking
at
me
curiously
but
i
could
feel
his
disappointment
in
me
you
did
do
anything
not
a
blasted
thing
more
than
you
were
told
to
do
the
world
full
of
supers
that
can
do
that
for
just
a
minute
i
forgot
the
diamond
then
it
a
mistake
you
were
wrong
and
and
i
ca
be
an
actress
he
threw
back
his
head
before
he
answered
puffing
a
mouthful
of
smoke
up
at
the
ceiling
as
he
did
the
night
he
caught
me
the
gesture
itself
seemed
to
remind
him
of
what
had
made
him
think
in
the
first
place
he
could
make
an
actress
of
me
for
he
laughed
down
at
me
and
i
saw
he
remembered
well
he
said
we
wait
and
see
i
was
mistaken
though
sure
enough
about
one
thing
that
night
i
looked
up
at
him
you
a
darn
sight
prettier
than
i
thought
you
were
the
gold
brick
you
sold
me
is
all
he
put
out
his
hand
to
touch
my
chin
i
and
he
turned
laughing
to
the
stage
but
he
called
after
me
is
a
beauty
success
going
to
content
you
olden
well
we
wait
and
see
i
drawled
back
at
him
in
his
own
throaty
bass
oh
i
was
drunk
mag
drunk
with
thinking
about
that
diamond
i
care
even
to
please
obermuller
i
just
wanted
the
feel
of
that
diamond
in
my
hand
i
wanted
it
lying
on
my
own
neck
the
lovely
cool
shining
rosy
thing
it
like
the
sunrise
mag
that
beauty
stone
it
just
a
tiny
pool
of
water
blushing
it
how
to
get
it
how
to
get
away
with
it
on
what
we
get
for
that
diamond
tom
and
i
when
his
time
is
up
could
live
for
all
our
lives
and
whoop
it
up
besides
we
could
live
in
paris
where
great
grafters
live
and
grafting
pays
where
if
you
got
wit
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
happen
to
be
a
darn
sight
prettier
you
can
just
spin
the
world
around
your
little
finger
but
do
you
know
even
then
i
could
bear
to
think
of
selling
the
pretty
thing
it
hurt
me
to
think
of
anybody
having
it
but
just
nance
olden
but
i
had
got
it
yet
gray
has
a
to
herself
and
on
her
table
which
is
a
big
box
open
end
down
just
where
the
big
mirror
can
multiply
the
jewels
and
make
you
want
three
times
as
bad
her
big
box
lies
open
while
she
dressing
and
undressing
other
times
it
locked
tight
and
his
lordship
himself
has
it
tight
in
his
own
right
hand
or
his
lordship
man
topham
has
it
just
as
tight
how
to
get
that
diamond
there
was
a
hard
nut
for
nance
olden
sharp
teeth
to
crack
i
only
wanted
that
never
say
i
greedy
mag
gray
could
keep
all
the
rest
of
the
things
the
pigeon
in
rubies
and
pearls
the
tiara
all
in
diamonds
the
chain
of
pearls
and
the
blazing
rings
and
the
all
of
emeralds
and
diamond
stars
but
that
diamond
that
huge
rose
diamond
i
could
i
just
could
let
her
have
it
and
yet
i
did
know
the
first
step
to
take
toward
getting
it
till
beryl
blackburn
helped
me
out
she
one
of
the
charities
like
me
a
tall
bleached
blonde
with
a
pretty
pale
face
and
eyes
and
if
you
believe
her
there
not
a
man
in
the
audience
afternoon
or
evening
that
is
on
her
guess
who
my
latest
she
said
to
me
this
afternoon
while
we
four
charities
stood
in
the
wings
waiting
topham
old
topham
it
all
got
clear
to
me
then
in
a
minute
topham
nothing
i
sneered
beryl
topham
thinks
of
only
one
thing
milady
do
you
fool
yourself
oh
does
he
miss
well
just
to
prove
it
he
let
me
try
on
the
rose
diamond
last
night
there
it
easy
to
say
so
but
i
do
see
the
proof
he
lose
his
job
so
quick
it
make
his
head
spin
if
he
did
it
not
if
he
did
but
if
they
knew
he
did
you
not
tell
not
me
why
would
i
i
do
believe
it
and
i
would
expect
anybody
else
to
i
do
believe
you
could
get
topham
to
budge
from
his
chair
in
gray
if
you
what
you
bet
i
bet
you
the
biggest
box
of
chocolate
creams
at
huyler
done
i
send
for
him
just
before
gray
and
her
lord
come
and
you
see
how
i
see
where
i
be
well
you
be
waiting
in
the
little
hall
right
of
gray
at
and
you
might
as
well
bring
the
creams
with
you
catch
on
mag
at
in
the
evening
i
was
waiting
but
not
in
the
little
hall
of
gray
i
had
gone
home
at
all
after
the
afternoon
performance
you
know
we
play
at
three
and
again
at
i
had
just
hidden
me
away
till
the
rest
were
gone
and
as
soon
as
the
coast
was
clear
i
got
into
gray
pushed
aside
the
chintz
curtains
of
the
big
box
that
makes
her
and
waited
lord
how
the
hours
dragged
i
had
had
anything
to
eat
since
lunch
and
it
got
darker
and
darker
in
there
and
hot
and
close
and
cramped
i
put
in
the
time
much
as
i
could
thinking
of
tom
the
very
first
thing
i
do
after
cashing
in
would
be
to
get
up
to
sing
sing
to
see
him
i
crazy
to
see
him
i
tell
him
the
news
and
see
if
he
could
bribe
a
guard
or
plan
some
scheme
with
me
to
get
out
soon
afraid
me
what
of
if
they
found
me
under
that
box
i
just
give
the
beryl
story
about
the
bet
how
do
you
know
they
believe
it
oh
i
do
care
you
got
to
take
chances
mag
monahan
if
you
go
in
for
big
things
and
this
was
big
huge
do
you
know
how
much
that
diamond
worth
and
do
you
know
how
to
spend
fifty
thousand
i
spent
it
all
there
in
the
box
every
penny
of
it
when
i
got
tired
spending
money
i
dozed
a
bit
and
in
my
dream
spent
it
over
again
and
then
i
waked
and
tried
to
fancy
new
ways
of
getting
rid
of
it
but
my
head
ached
and
my
back
ached
and
my
whole
body
was
so
strained
and
cramped
that
i
was
on
the
point
of
giving
it
all
up
when
that
blessed
old
topham
came
in
he
set
the
big
box
down
with
a
bang
that
nearly
cracked
my
head
he
turned
on
the
lights
and
stood
whistling
tommy
atkins
and
then
suddenly
there
came
a
soft
call
topham
topham
i
leaned
back
and
bit
my
fingers
till
i
knew
i
would
shriek
the
englishman
listened
a
minute
then
the
call
came
again
and
topham
creaked
to
the
door
and
out
in
a
twinkling
i
was
out
too
you
bet
mag
he
had
opened
the
box
at
all
there
it
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
space
framed
by
the
three
glasses
i
pulled
at
the
lid
locked
i
could
have
screamed
with
rage
but
the
sound
of
his
step
outside
the
door
sobered
me
he
was
coming
back
in
a
frantic
hurry
i
turned
toward
the
window
which
i
had
unlocked
when
i
came
in
four
hours
ago
but
i
had
time
to
make
it
i
heard
the
old
fellow
hand
on
the
door
and
i
tumbled
back
into
the
box
in
such
a
rush
that
the
curtains
were
still
waving
when
he
came
in
slowly
he
began
to
place
the
jewels
one
by
one
in
the
order
her
ladyship
puts
them
on
we
charity
girls
had
often
watched
him
from
the
door
he
never
let
one
of
us
put
a
foot
inside
he
was
method
and
order
itself
he
never
changed
the
order
in
which
he
lifted
the
glittering
things
out
nor
the
places
he
put
them
back
in
i
put
my
hand
up
against
the
top
of
the
box
tracing
the
spot
where
each
piece
would
be
lying
think
mag
just
half
an
inch
between
me
and
quarter
of
a
million
oh
i
was
sore
as
i
lay
there
and
i
was
so
either
that
i
get
out
of
it
straight
i
tried
the
beryl
story
lots
of
ways
on
myself
but
somehow
every
time
i
fancied
myself
telling
it
to
obermuller
it
got
tangled
up
and
lay
dumb
and
heavy
inside
of
me
but
at
least
it
would
be
better
to
appear
of
my
own
will
before
the
old
englishman
than
be
discovered
by
lord
gray
and
his
lady
i
had
my
fingers
on
the
curtains
and
in
another
second
i
been
out
when
miss
beryl
blackburn
compliments
topham
and
would
you
step
to
the
door
as
there
something
most
important
she
wants
to
tell
you
oh
i
loved
every
syllable
that
spoke
there
was
a
giggle
behind
his
voice
too
old
topham
was
the
butt
of
every
joke
the
first
call
which
had
fooled
me
must
have
been
from
some
giddy
girl
who
wanted
to
guy
the
old
fellow
she
had
fooled
me
all
right
but
this
this
one
was
the
real
article
there
was
a
pause
topham
must
be
looking
about
to
be
sure
things
were
safe
then
he
creaked
to
the
door
and
shut
it
carefully
behind
him
it
only
took
a
minute
but
in
that
minute
in
that
minute
mag
i
had
the
rose
diamond
clutched
safe
in
my
fingers
i
was
on
the
top
of
the
big
trunk
and
out
of
the
window
oh
the
feel
of
that
beautiful
thing
in
my
hand
i
loved
it
if
it
had
been
worth
a
penny
but
as
it
was
i
adored
it
i
slipped
the
chain
under
my
collar
and
the
diamond
slid
down
my
neck
and
i
felt
its
kiss
on
my
skin
i
flew
down
the
black
corridor
bumping
into
scenery
and
nearly
tripping
two
stage
carpenters
i
heard
ginger
the
ahead
of
me
and
dodged
behind
some
properties
just
in
time
he
went
whistling
past
and
i
got
to
the
stage
door
i
pulled
it
open
tenderly
cautiously
and
turned
to
shut
it
after
me
and
and
something
held
it
open
in
spite
of
me
no
no
mag
it
was
a
man
it
was
a
memory
it
rose
up
there
and
hit
me
right
over
the
heart
the
memory
of
nancy
olden
happiness
the
first
time
she
come
in
this
very
door
feeling
that
she
actually
had
a
right
to
use
a
stage
entrance
feeling
that
she
belonged
she
nancy
to
this
wonderland
of
the
stage
you
must
never
tell
tom
mag
promise
he
would
see
he
understand
i
could
make
him
know
what
i
felt
any
more
than
dare
tell
him
what
i
did
i
shut
the
door
but
not
behind
me
i
shut
it
on
the
street
and
mag
i
shut
for
ever
another
door
too
the
old
door
that
opens
out
on
crooked
street
with
my
hand
on
my
heart
that
was
beating
as
though
it
would
burst
i
flew
back
again
through
the
black
corridor
through
the
wings
and
out
to
obermuller
office
with
both
my
hands
i
ripped
open
the
neck
of
my
dress
and
pulling
the
chain
with
that
great
diamond
hanging
to
it
i
broke
it
with
a
tug
and
threw
the
whole
thing
down
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him
for
god
sake
i
yelled
do
make
it
so
easy
for
me
to
steal
i
do
know
what
happened
for
a
minute
i
could
see
his
face
change
half
a
dozen
ways
in
as
many
seconds
he
took
it
up
in
his
fingers
at
last
it
swung
there
at
the
end
of
the
slender
little
broken
chain
like
a
great
drop
of
shining
water
blushing
and
sparkling
and
trembling
his
hands
trembled
too
and
he
looked
up
at
last
from
the
diamond
to
my
face
it
worth
at
least
fifty
thousand
you
know
valued
at
that
i
did
answer
he
got
up
and
came
over
to
where
i
had
thrown
myself
on
a
bench
what
the
matter
olden
do
i
pay
you
enough
i
want
to
see
tom
i
begged
it
so
long
since

i
nodded
you
poor
little
devil
that
finished
me
i
not
used
to
being
pitied
i
sobbed
and
sobbed
as
though
some
dam
had
broken
inside
of
me
you
see
mag
i
knew
in
that
minute
that
i
been
afraid
deathly
afraid
of
fred
face
when
it
scornful
and
sarcastic
and
of
his
voice
when
it
cuts
the
flesh
of
off
your
very
bones
and
the
contrast
well
it
was
too
much
for
me
but
something
came
quick
to
sober
me
it
was
gray

stormed
in
followed
by
lord
harold
and
topham
and
half
the
company

gray
rose

your
precautions

up
there
who
make
things
soft
and
easy
for
my
tommy
i
had
so
much
to
tell
him
i
knew
just
how
i
take
off
every
member
of
the
company
to
amuse
him
i
had
memorized
every
joke
i
heard
since
i
got
behind
the
curtain
not
very
hard
for
me
things
always
had
a
way
of
sticking
in
my
mind
i
knew
the
newest
songs
in
town
and
the
choruses
of
all
the
old
ones
i
could
show
him
the
latest
tricks
with
cards
i
got
those
at
first
hand
from
professor
haughwout
you
know
how
great
tom
is
on
tricks
i
could
explain
the
disappearing
woman
mystery
and
the
mirror
cabinet
i
knew
the
clog
dance
that
dewitt
and
daniels
do
i
had
pictures
of
the
trained
seals
the
great
elephant
act
mademoiselle
picotte
doing
her
great
dance
and
the
brothers
borodini
in
their
pyramid
tumbling
yes
it
was
a
whole
vaudeville
show
with
refreshments
between
the
acts
that
i
was
taking
up
to
tom
dorgan
i
do
care
much
for
a
lot
of
that
truck
funny
is
it
how
you
get
to
turn
up
your
nose
at
the
things
you
have
given
a
finger
for
once
upon
a
time
but
tom
oh
i
got
everything
pat
for
him
my
big
handsome
tom
dorgan
in
stripes
with
his
curls
all
shaved
off
ugh
i
got
just
so
far
in
my
thoughts
sitting
there
in
the
train
when
i
gave
a
shiver
i
thought
for
a
minute
it
was
at
the
idea
of
my
tom
with
one
of
those
bare
round
on
him
that
look
like
fat
skeleton
faces
but
it
was
it
was
guess
mag
moriway
both
of
us
thought
the
same
thing
of
each
other
for
the
first
second
that
our
eyes
met
i
could
see
that
he
thought
i
was
caught
at
last
and
i
thought
he
been
sharp
once
too
often
and
mag
it
would
be
hard
to
say
which
of
us
would
have
been
happier
if
it
had
been
the
truth
oh
to
meet
moriway
bound
sure
enough
for
sing
sing
he
got
up
and
came
over
to
me
smiling
wickedly
he
took
the
seat
behind
me
and
leaning
forward
said
softly
is
miss
omar
engaged
to
read
to
some
invalid
up
at
sing
sing
and
for
how
long
a
term
i
should
say
engagement
i
got
through
shivering
by
then
i
was
ready
for
him
i
turned
and
looked
at
him
in
that
very
polite
distant
sort
o
way
gray
uses
in
her
act
when
the
charity
superintendent
speaks
to
her
it
the
only
decent
thing
she
does
chances
are
that
that
how
lord
gray
mother
looks
at
her
you
know
my
sister
i
asked
humbly
he
looked
at
me
perplexed
for
just
a
second
sister
be
hanged
he
said
at
last
i
know
you
nat
and
i
glad
to
my
that
you
got
it
in
the
neck
in
spite
of
all
your
smartness
you
altogether
wrong
sir
i
said
very
stately
but
hurt
a
bit
you
know
i
often
been
taken
for
my
sister
but
gentlemen
usually
apologize
when
i
explain
to
them
it
hard
enough
to
have
a
sister
who
i
looked
up
at
him
tearfully
with
my
chin
with
sorrow
he
grinned
liars
should
have
good
memories
he
sneered
miss
omar
said
she
was
an
orphan
you
remember
and
had
not
a
relative
in
the
world
did
she
say
that
did
nora
say
that
i
exclaimed
piteously
oh
what
a
little
liar
she
is
i
suppose
she
thought
it
made
her
more
interesting
to
be
so
alone
more
appealing
to
gentlemen
like
yourself
i
hope
she
was
ungrateful
to
you
too
as
she
was
to
that
kind
latimer
before
he
found
her
out
and
she
had
such
a
good
position
there
too
i
wanted
to
look
at
him
oh
i
wanted
to
but
it
was
my
role
to
sit
there
with
downcast
eyes
just
the
picture
of
holy
grief
i
was
the
good
one
the
good
shocked
sister
and
though
i
was
a
bit
afraid
of
anything
he
could
do
to
me
or
any
game
he
could
put
up
i
yearned
to
make
him
believe
me
just
because
he
was
so
suspicious
so
wickedly
smart
so
sure
he
was
on
but
his
very
silence
sort
of
told
me
he
almost
believed
or
that
he
was
laying
a
trap
will
you
tell
me
he
said
how
you
your
sister
got
latimer
to
lie
for
her
latimer
lie
oh
you
do
know
him
he
expected
a
lady
to
read
to
him
that
very
evening
he
had
never
seen
her
and
when
nora
walked
into
the
garden
after
getting
a
skirt
somewhere
yes
the
housekeeper
it
happened
to
be
her
evening
out
why
he
just
naturally
supposed
nora
was
miss
omar
ah
then
her
name
is
omar
what
might
it
be
i
rather
not
tell
if
you
do
mind
but
when
latimer
found
out
she
had
the
diamonds
he
did
find
out
she
confessed
to
him
nora
not
really
so
bad
a
girl
as
very
interesting
but
it
does
happen
to
be
latimer
version
and
you
say
latimer
would
lie
i
got
pale
but
the
paleness
was
on
the
inside
of
me
think
i
was
going
to
flinch
before
a
chump
like
moriway
even
if
i
had
walked
straight
into
his
trap
it
is
i
exclaimed
no
latimer
note
to
kingdon
said
the
diamonds
were
found
in
the
jacket
the
thief
had
left
behind
him
well
it
only
shows
what
a
bad
habit
lying
is
nora
must
have
fibbed
to
me
for
the
pure
pleasure
of
fibbing
i
never
dare
to
trust
her
again
do
you
believe
then
that
she
did
have
anything
to
do
with
the
hotel
robbery
i
do
hope
so
it
one
less
sin
on
her
wicked
head
it
hard
having
such
a
girl
in
the
family
oh
was
i
grieved
he
looked
me
straight
in
the
eye
i
looked
at
him
i
was
unutterably
sad
about
that
tough
sister
of
mine
and
i
vow
i
looked
holy
then
though
i
never
did
before
and
may
never
again
well
i
only
saw
her
in
the
twilight
he
said
slowly
watching
my
face
all
the
time
you
two
sisters
are
certainly
miraculously
alike
the
train
was
slowing
down
and
i
got
up
with
my
basket
i
stood
right
before
him
my
full
face
turned
toward
him
are
we
i
asked
simply
do
you
think
it
more
the
expression
than
anything
else
and
the
voice
nora
really
much
fairer
than
i
am
he
watched
me
as
i
went
out
i
felt
his
eyes
on
the
back
of
my
jacket
and
i
was
tempted
to
turn
at
the
door
and
make
a
face
at
him
but
i
knew
something
better
and
safer
than
that
i
waited
till
the
train
was
just
pulling
out
and
then
standing
below
his
window
i
motioned
to
him
to
raise
it
he
did
i
thought
you
were
going
to
get
out
here
i
called
are
you
sure
you
do
belong
in
sing
sing
mr
moriway
i
can
see
his
face
yet
mag
and
every
time
i
think
of
it
it
makes
me
nearly
die
of
laughing
he
had
actually
been
fooled
another
time
it
was
worth
the
trip
up
there
to
make
a
guy
of
him
once
more
and
whether
it
was
or
not
mag
it
was
all
i
got
after
all
for
would
you
believe
tom
dorgan
would
turn
out
such
a
sorehead
he
kicked
up
such
a
row
ever
since
he
got
there
that
it
the
dark
cell
for
him
and
solitary
confinement
think
of
it
for
tom
i
begged
i
bluffed
i
cried
i
coaxed
but
many
the
nance
olden
that
has
played
her
game
against
the
rules
of
sing
sing
and
lost
they
would
even
let
me
leave
the
things
for
him
or
give
him
a
message
from
me
and
back
to
the
station
i
had
to
carry
the
basket
and
all
the
schemes
i
had
to
make
old
tom
dorgan
grin
all
the
way
back
i
had
him
in
my
mind
he
a
tiger
tom
when
roused
i
could
see
him
shut
up
there
by
himself
with
not
a
soul
to
talk
to
with
not
a
human
eye
to
look
into
with
not
a
thing
on
earth
to
do
tom
who
action
itself
he
never
was
much
of
a
thinker
and
i
never
saw
him
read
even
a
newspaper
what
would
he
do
to
kill
the
time
ca
you
see
him
there
at
bay
back
on
his
haunches
cursing
and
cursed
alone
in
the
everlasting
black
silence
i
saw
nothing
else
wherever
i
turned
my
eyes
that
terrible
picture
was
before
me
and
always
it
was
just
on
the
verge
of
becoming
something
else
something
worse
he
could
throttle
the
world
with
his
bare
hands
if
it
had
but
one
neck
in
the
mood
he
must
be
in
now
it
was
when
i
could
bear
it
a
moment
longer
that
i
set
my
mind
to
find
something
else
to
think
of
i
found
it
mag
do
you
know
what
it
was
it
was
just
three
words
of
obermuller
earn
it
now
after
all
miss
monahan
this
graft
of
honesty
they
all
preach
so
much
about
has
anything
mysterious
in
it
all
it
is
is
putting
your
wits
to
work
according
to
the
rules
of
the
game
and
not
against
them
i
was
driven
to
it
the
thought
of
big
tom
crouching
for
a
spring
in
the
dark
cell
up
yonder
sent
me
whirling
out
into
the
thinking
place
like
the
picture
of
the
soul
in
the
big
book
at
latimer
i
read
out
of
and
first
thing
you
know
honor
mag
it
was
as
much
fun
planning
how
to
earn
it
now
as
any
lifting
i
ever
schemed
getting
the
best
of
people
that
always
charmed
me
and
here
was
a
way
to
fool
according
to
law
so
busy
i
was
making
it
all
up
that
the
train
pulled
into
the
station
before
i
knew
it
i
gave
a
last
thought
to
that
poor
old
hyena
of
a
tom
and
then
put
him
out
of
my
mind
i
had
other
fish
to
fry
straight
down
to
mother
douty
i
went
with
my
basket
a
fool
girl
mother
on
her
way
up
to
sing
sing
lost
her
basket
and
nance
olden
found
it
it
ought
to
be
worth
a
good
deal
she
grinned
you
could
make
old
douty
believe
that
the
lord
himself
would
steal
if
he
got
a
chance
and
she
knows
the
chances
that
come
butting
up
against
nancy
olden
why
did
i
lie
to
her
not
for
practice
i
assure
you
she
have
beaten
me
down
to
the
last
cent
if
she
thought
it
was
mine
but
she
always
thinks
there
be
a
find
for
her
in
something
that
stolen
so
i
let
her
think
i
stolen
it
in
the
railway
station
and
we
came
to
terms
with
what
she
gave
me
i
bought
a
wig
mag
i
want
you
some
day
when
you
can
get
off
to
come
and
see
that
wig
i
should
wonder
but
you
recognize
it
it
red
of
very
coarse
hair
but
a
wonderful
color
and
so
long
it
yes
it
might
be
your
own
mag
monahan
it
so
much
like
it
i
went
to
the
theater
and
got
my
charity
rig
took
it
home
and
sat
for
hours
there
just
looking
at
both
when
evening
came
i
was
ready
to
earn
it
now
you
see
obermuller
had
given
me
the
whole
day
to
be
away
and
neither
gray
nor
the
other
three
charities
expected
me
back
i
had
to
do
it
on
the
sly
you
sassy
mag
yes
it
was
partly
because
i
love
to
cheat
but
more
because
i
was
bound
to
have
my
chance
once
whether
anybody
else
enjoyed
it
or
not
i
came
to
the
theater
in
my
charity
rig
and
the
wig
it
looked
as
if
i
slept
in
it
and
it
came
down
to
the
draggled
hem
of
the
skirt
all
the
way
there
i
walked
like
you
mag
once
when
a
newsboy
grinned
at
me
and
shouted
carrots
i
grinned
back
your
own
old
cruelty
grin
mag
i
vow
i
felt
so
much
like
you
as
you
used
to
be
that
when
i
lurched
out
on
the
stage
at
last
stumbling
over
my
shoe
laces
and
trying
to
push
the
hair
out
of
my
eyes
you
have
sworn
it
was
little
mag
monahan
i
making
her
debut
in
the
cruelty
room
oh
mag
mag
you
darling
mag
did
you
ever
hear
a
whole
house
a
great
big
theater
full
of
a
peevish
vaudeville
audience
just
rise
at
you
give
one
roar
of
laughter
they
had
expected
at
all
to
give
and
then
settle
down
to
giggle
at
every
move
you
made
girl
alive
i
just
had
they
could
take
their
eyes
off
me
if
i
squirmed
they
howled
if
i
stood
on
one
foot
scratching
the
torn
leg
of
my
stocking
with
the
other
you
know
mag
they
yelled
if
i
grinned
they
just
roared
oh
mag
ca
you
see
do
you
understand
i
was
it
the
center
of
the
stage
i
carried
round
with
me
it
was
just
nancy
olden
and
for
ten
minutes
nancy
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
play
with
my
life
mag
it
just
like
stealing
the
old
graft
exactly
it
so
fascinating
so
busy
and
risky
except
that
they
play
the
game
with
you
and
pay
you
and
love
you
to
fool
when
the
curtain
fell
it
was
different
grays
followed
by
the
charities
all
clean
and
and
not
in
it
not
even
on
the
edge
of
it
stormed
up
to
obermuller
standing
at
the
wings
i
quit
the
show
here
and
now
she
squawked
it
a
shame
a
beastly
shame
how
dare
you
play
me
such
a
trick
fred
obermuller
i
never
was
treated
so
in
my
life
to
have
that
dirty
little
wretch
come
tumbling
on
like
that
without
even
so
much
as
your
telling
me
made
up
all
this
new
business
for
her
it
indecent
anyway
why
i
lost
my
cue
there
was
a
gap
for
a
full
minute
the
whole
act
was
such
a
ghastly
failure
that
i
that
you
better
go
out
now
and
make
your
prettiest
bow
gray
phew
listen
to
the
house
roar
that
what
i
call
applause
go
on
now
she
went
me
i
did
say
a
word
i
looked
at
obermuller
and
and
i
just
did
like
this
yes
winked
mag
monahan
i
was
so
crazily
happy
i
had
to
did
i
but
do
you
know
what
he
did
do
you
know
what
he
did
well
i
suppose
i
am
screaming
and
the
troyons
will
put
me
out
but
he
just
winked
back
and
then
gray
came
trailing
back
into
the
wings
and
the
shrieking
and
thumping
and
whistling
out
in
front
just
went
on
and
on
and
on
and
on
um
i
just
listened
and
loved
it
every
thump
of
it
and
i
stood
there
like
a
demure
little
kitten
or
more
like
mag
monahan
after
had
a
good
licking
and
was
good
and
quiet
and
i
never
so
much
as
budged
till
obermuller
said
well
nance
you
have
earned
it
the
gall
of
you
but
it
only
proves
that
fred
obermuller
never
yet
bought
a
gold
brick
only
let
me
in
on
your
racket
next
time
there
go
on
take
it
it
yours
oh
to
have
fred
obermuller
say
things
like
that
to
you

gave
me
a
bit
of
a
push
was
just
a
i
stumbled
out
on
to
the
stage

why

want

more
why
here
be
a
place
for
me
too
does
it
look
that
way
divil
a
bit
you
croaker
it
looks
it
looks
listen
and
i
tell
you
how
it
looks
it
looks
as
though
gray
and
the
great
gray
rose
diamond
and
the
three
charities
had
all
become
a
bit
of
background
for
nance
olden
to
play
upon
it
looks
as
though
the
audience
likes
the
sound
of
my
voice
as
much
almost
as
i
do
myself
anyway
as
much
as
it
does
the
sight
of
me
it
looks
as
though
the
press
if
you
please
had
discovered
a
new
stage
star
for
down
comes
a
little
reporter
to
interview
me
me
nancy

think
of
that
mag
i
receive
him
all
in
my
charity
rig
and
in
obermuller
office
and
he
asks
me
silly
questions
and
i
tell
him
a
lot
of
nonsense
but
some
truths
too
about
the
cruelty
fancy
he
did
know
what
the
cruelty
was
he
calls
it
and
all
the
time
we
talked
a
german
artist
he
had
brought
with
him
was
sketching
nance
olden
in
different
poses
is
that
the
limit
what
d
think
tom
dorgan
say
to
see
half
a
page
of
nancy
olden
in
the
would
his
eyes
pop
poor
old
tom
no
danger

wo
let
him
have
the
papers
my
old
tommy
what
is
it
mag
oh
what
was
i
saying
yes

how
it
looks
well
it
looks
as
though
the
trust
yes
the
big
and
mighty
short
for
theatrical
trust
you
innocent
had
heard
of
that
same
nance
olden
you
read
about
in
the
papers
for
one
night
last
week
when
i
just
come
of
and
the
house
was
yelling
and
shouting
behind
me
obermuller
meets
me
in
the
wings
and
trots
me
of
to
his
private
office
what
for
i
asked
him
on
the
way
you
find
out
in
a
minute
come
on
i
pulled
up
my
stocking
and
followed
you
know
i
wear
it
in
that
act
without
a
garter
and
it
always
coming
down
the
way
yours
used
to
mag
even
when
it
does
come
down
i
pull
it
up
i
so
in
the
habit
of
doing
it
a
little
bit
of
a
man
with
a
dyspeptic
little
black
mustache
turned
down
at
the
corners
watched
me
come
in
he
grinned
at
my
and
then
at
me
clever
little
girl
he
says
through
his
nose
how
much
do
you
stick
obermuller
for
clever
little
man
say
i
bold
as
brass
and
through
my
own
nose
none
of
your
business
hi
you
olden
roared
obermuller
as
though
i
run
away
and
he
was
trying
to
get
the
bit
from
between
my
teeth
answer
the
gentleman
prettily
do
you
know
a
representative
of
the
mighty
when
you
see
him
ca
you
see
the
syndicate
aureole
about
his
noble
brow
this
gentleman
nance
is
the
great
and
only
max
tausig
he
humbleth
the
exalted
and
uplifteth
the
lowly
or
if
there
more
money
in
it
he
gives
to
him
that
hath
and
steals
from
him
that
has
but
would
mighty
well
like
to
have
he
has
no
conscience
no
bowels
no
heart
but
he
has
got
tin
and
nerve
and
power
to
beat
the
band
in
short
and
for
all
practical
purposes
for
one
in
your
profession
nancy
olden
he
just
god
down
on
your
knees
and
lick
his
boots
trust
gods
wear
boots
patent
leathers
and
thank
him
for
permitting
it
you
lucky
baggage
i
looked
at
the
little
man
the
angry
red
was
just
fading
from
the
top
of
his
bald
head
you
always
were
a
fool
obermuller
he
said
cordially
and
you
were
always
of
your
jokes
if
you
had
been
so
smart
with
your
tongue
you
had
more
friends
and
not
so
many
enemies
in
in
the
heavenly
syndicate
eh
well
i
have
lived
without
you
have
lived
but
but
where
do
i
expect
to
go
when
i
die
good
theatrical
managers
nance
when
they
die
as
individuals
go
to
heaven
they
get
into
the
trust
after
that
they
just
touch
buttons
the
trust
does
the
rest
bad
ones
the
kickers
the
fred
obermullers
go
to
a
place
where
salaries
cease
from
troubling
and
royalties
are
at
rest
it
a
slow
place
where
where
in
short
there
nothing
doing
and
only
one
thing
done
the
kicker
it
that
place
tausig
thinks
i
bound
for
and
it
that
place
he
come
to
rescue
you
from
from
sheer
goodness
of
heart
and
a
wary
eye
for
all
there
in
it
cinch
him
olden
for
all
the
traffic
will
bear
i
looked
from
one
to
the
other
obermuller
big
and
savage
underneath
all
his
gay
talk
i
knew
him
well
enough
to
see
that
the
little
man
his
mouth
turned
down
at
the
corners
and
a
sneer
in
his
eye
for
the
fellow
that
was
clever
enough
to
get
in
with
the
push
you
must
not
give
the
young
woman
the
big
head
obermuller
her
own
is
big
enough
i
bet
as
it
is
i
ai
prepared
to
make
any
startling
offer
to
a
little
girl
that
just
barely
got
her
nose
above
the
wall
the
slightest
shake
might
knock
her
off
altogether
or
she
might
have
strength
enough
in
herself
to
hold
on
but
we
give
her
a
chance
and
because
of
what
it
may
lead
to
if
she
works
hard
because
of
the
opportunities
we
can
give
her
there
ai
so
much
in
it
in
a
money
way
as
you
might
imagine
obermuller
did
say
anything
his
own
lips
and
his
own
eyes
sneered
now
and
he
winked
openly
at
me
which
made
the
little
man
hot
blast
it
he
twanged
i
mean
it
if
you
got
any
notion
through
my
coming
down
to
your
dirty
little
joint
that
we
set
our
hearts
on
having
the
girl
just
get
busy
thinking
something
else
she
may
be
worth
something
to
you
measured
up
against
the
dubs
you
got
but
to
us
to
you
it
not
so
much
your
not
having
her
as
my
having
her
that
exactly
it
ai
our
policy
to
leave
any
doubtful
cards
in
the
enemy
hands
he
can
have
the
bad
ones
he
could
get
the
good
ones
and
the
doubtful
ones
like
this
girl
olden
well
that
just
where
you
mistaken
obermuller
thrust
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
and
put
out
that
square
chin
of
his
like
the
fighter
he
is
girl
olden
is
anything
but
doubtful
she
a
big
card
right
now
if
she
could
be
well
handled
and
the
time
is
so
far
off
when
if
you
get
her
you
people
will
be
just
how
much
is
your
interest
in
her
worth
the
little
man
sneered
obermuller
glared
at
him
and
in
the
pause
i
murmured
demurely
only
a
contract
mag
you
should
have
seen
jump
both
of
the
little
man
with
vexation
the
big
one
with
surprise
a
contract
me
nance
olden
why
mag
you
innocent
of
course
i
had
managers
do
give
contracts
to
girl
burglars
who
never
set
foot
on
the
stage
when
the
little
man
was
gone
obermuller
cornered
me
what
your
game
olden
he
cried
you
too
deep
for
me
i
throw
up
my
hands
come
what
you
got
in
that
smart
little
head
of
yours
are
you
holding
out
for
higher
stakes
do
you
expect
him
to
buy
that
great
contract
and
divvy
the
proceeds
with
me
because
he
will
when
once
they
get
their
eye
on
you
they
have
you
and
to
turn
up
your
nose
at
their
offer
if
in
just
the
way
to
make
them
itch
for
you
but
how
the
deuce
did
you
find
it
out
and
where
do
you
get
your
nerve
from
anyway
a
little
beggar
like
you
to
refuse
an
offer
from
the
and
sit
hatching
your
schemes
on
your
little
old
dollars
a
week
it
have
to
be
twice
now
i
suppose
all
right
just
as
you
say
i
laughed
but
why
are
you
in
the
trust
fred
obermuller
why
are
you
in
society
nance
um
well
because
society
prejudiced
against
lifting
but
the
trust
is
do
you
know
that
a
great
graft
obermuller
lifting
wholesale
why
do
you
get
in
because
a
trust
is
a
lot
of
sailors
on
a
raft
who
keep
their
places
by
kicking
off
the
drowning
hands
that
clutch
at
it
can
you
fancy
a
fellow
like
tausig
stooping
down
to
help
me
tenderly
on
board
to
divide
the
pickings
no
but
i
can
fancy
you
grappling
with
him
till
he
be
glad
to
take
you
on
rather
than
be
pulled
off
himself
you
be
in
with
the
push
would
you
olden
if
you
were
managing
he
asked
with
a
grin
i
be
at
the
top
wherever
that
was
then
why
the
deuce
did
you
jump
at
tausig
offer
were
you
really
crafty
enough
i
am
artiste
monsieur
obermuller
i
gutturaled
like
mademoiselle
picotte
who
dances
on
the
wire
i
moost
have
about
me
those
who
arre
who
arre
congeniale
you
monkey
he
laughed
then
when
tausig
comes
to
buy
your
contract
we
tell
him
to
go
to
thunder
he
laughed
say
mag
that
big
fellow
is
like
a
boy
when
he
pleased
i
guess
that
what
makes
it
such
fun
to
please
him
and
i
who
admired
your
business
sagacity
in
holding
off
nance
he
said
i
thought
you
admired
my
of
mademoiselle
picotte
well
well
why
do
you
make
use
of
it
take
me
round
to
the
theaters
and
let
me
mimic
all
the
swell
actors
and
actresses
i
got
more
chance
with
you
than
with
that
trust
gang
they
would
give
me
room
to
do
my
own
stunt
they
make
me
fit
into
theirs
but
you
but
me
you
think
you
can
wind
me
round
your
finger
not
yet
he
chuckled
i
thought
i
had
him
going
i
saw
nance
olden
spending
her
evenings
at
the
big
broadway
theaters
when
just
at
that
minute
ginger
the
burst
in
with
a
note
say
mag
i
would
like
to
get
that
man
obermuller
hopping
mad
at
me
and
nancy
olden
no
coward
either
but
the
way
he
gritted
his
teeth
at
that
note
and
the
devil
in
his
eyes
when
he
lifted
them
from
it
made
me
wonder
how
i
ever
dared
be
facetious
with
him
i
got
up
to
go
he
forgotten
me
but
he
looked
up
then
that
was
a
great
suggestion
of
yours
olden
to
put
lord
gray
on
to
act
himself
great
his
voice
shook
he
was
so
angry
well
i
snapped
i
was
going
to
let
him
see
that
a
big
man
raging
could
bluff
nance
olden
what
did
he
mean
why
just
this
there
was
lord
harold
gray
the
real
lord
behind
the
scenes
bringing
the
lady
who
was
really
only
a
chorus
girl
to
the
show
in
his
automobile
helping
her
dress
like
a
maid
holding
her
box
of
jewels
as
he
tagged
after
her
like
a
big
newfoundland
smoking
his
one
cigarette
solemnly
and
admiringly
while
she
was
on
the
stage
poking
after
her
like
a
tame
bear
he
a
funny
fellow
that
lord
harold
he
a
tom
dorgan
with
the
brains
and
the
graft
and
and
the
brute
too
mag
washed
out
of
him
a
tom
dorgan
that
been
kept
dressed
in
swagger
clothes
all
his
life
and
living
at
a
big
clean
handsome
stupid
overgrown
boy
yes
i
coming
to
it
when
i
seen
him
go
tagging
after
her
chippy
ladyship
behind
the
scenes
long
enough
i
told
obermuller
one
day
that
it
was
absurd
to
send
the
mock
lady
out
on
the
boards
and
keep
the
live
lord
hidden
behind
he
jumped
at
the
idea
and
they
rigged
up
a
little
act
for
the
two
the
lord
and
the
lady
gray
was
furious
when
she
heard
of
it
their
making
use
of
her
lord
in
such
a
way
but
lord
harold
just
swallowed
his
big
adam
apple
with
a
gulp
or
two
and
said
honor
it
a
blawsted
scheme
you
know
but
i
jolly
sure
make
a
bleddy
ass
of
myself
i
caw
act
you
know
the
ninny
you
know
he
thinks
gray
really
can
but
obermuller
explained
to
him
that
he
need
act
just
be
himself
out
behind
the
wings
and
lo
lord
harold
was
chawmed
and
gray
why
she
gave
in
at
last
pretended
to
anyway
sliding
out
of
the
charity
sketch
and
rehearsing
the
thing
with
him
and
all
that
and
and
do
you
know
what
she
did
mag
nance
olden
may
be
pretty
mean
but
she
would
do
a
trick
like
that
she
waited
till
ten
minutes
before
time
for
the
thing
to
be
put
on
and
then
threw
a
fit
she
so
ill
her
delicate
ladyship
so
ill
she
just
ca
go
on
this
evening
wonder
how
long
she
thinks
such
an
excuse
will
keep
lord
harold
off
when
i
want
him
on
growled
obermuller
throwing
her
note
over
to
me
he
have
liked
to
throw
it
at
me
if
it
been
heavy
enough
to
hurt
he
was
so
thumping
mad
you
see
there
it
was
on
the
program
the
clever
sketch
entitled
theatrical
aristocracy
the
duke
of
portmanteau
lord
harold
gray
the
duchess
lady
gray
the
celebrated
gray
jewels
including
the
great
rose
diamond
will
be
worn
by
lady
gray
in
this
number
no
wonder
obermuller
was
raging
i
looked
at
him
you
do
like
to
tackle
a
fellow
like
that
when
he
dancing
hot
and
yet
you
ache
to
help
him
and
yes
yourself
lord
harold
here
yet
and
the
jewels
i
asked
he
gave
a
short
nod
he
was
thinking
but
so
was
i
then
all
he
wants
is
a
lady
that
all
he
said
sarcastically
well
what
the
matter
with
me
he
gasped
there
nothing
the
matter
with
your
nerve
olden
thank
you
so
much
it
was
the
way
gray
says
it
when
she
tries
to
have
an
english
accent
dress
me
up
fred
obermuller
in
gray
new
silk
gown
and
the
gray
jewels
and
you
never
i
never
set
eyes
on
you
again
you
never
know
if
you
were
in
the
audience
that
it
was
gray
herself
i
can
take
her
off
to
the
life
and
if
the
prompter
stand
by
he
looked
at
me
for
a
full
minute
try
it
olden
he
said
i
did
i
flew
to
gray
she
gone
home
deathly
ill
of
course
they
gave
me
the
best
seamstress
in
the
place
she
let
out
the
waist
a
bit
and
pulled
over
the
lace
to
cover
it
i
got
into
that
mass
of
silk
and
lace
oh
silk
on
silk
and
nance
olden
inside
beryl
blackburn
did
my
hair
and
grace
weston
put
on
my
slippers
topham
himself
hung
me
with
those
gorgeous
shining
diamonds
and
pearls
and
emeralds
till
i
felt
like
an
idol
loaded
with
booty
there
were
so
many
standing
round
me
rigging
me
up
that
i
did
get
a
glimpse
of
the
mirror
till
the
second
before
ginger
called
me
but
in
that
second
in
that
second
mag
monahan
i
saw
a
fairy
with
blazing
cheeks
and
shining
eyes
with
a
diamond
coronet
in
her
brown
hair
puffed
high
and
pearls
on
her
bare
neck
and
arms
and
emeralds
over
the
waist
and
rubies
and
pearls
on
her
fingers
and
sprays
of
diamonds
like
frost
on
the
lace
of
her
skirt
and
diamond
buckles
on
her
very
slippers
and
the
rose
diamond
like
a
sun
outshining
all
the
rest
and
and
mag
it
was
me
how
did
it
go
well
would
it
make
you
think
you
were
a
lady
sure
enough
if
you
could
move
without
that
lace
train
billowing
after
you
without
being
dazzled
with
without
a
truly
lord
tagging
after
you
he
kept
his
head
lord
harold
did
even
if
it
is
a
that
helped
me
at
first
he
was
so
cold
so
stupid
so
slow
so
so
just
himself
and
after
the
first
plunge
i
tell
you
mag
monahan
there
one
thing
that
stronger
than
wine
to
a
woman
it
being
beautiful
oh
and
i
was
beautiful
i
knew
it
before
i
got
that
quick
hush
with
the
full
applause
after
it
and
because
i
was
beautiful
i
got
saucy
and
then
calm
and
then
i
caught
fred
obermuller
voice
he
had
taken
the
book
from
the
prompter
and
stood
there
himself
and
after
that
it
was
easy
sailing
he
was
there
yet
when
the
act
was
over
and
i
trailed
out
followed
by
my
lord
he
let
the
fall
from
his
hands
and
reached
them
both
out
to
me
i
flirted
my
jeweled
fan
at
him
and
swept
him
a
courtesy
cool
no
i
was
not
a
bit
of
it
he
was
daffy
with
the
sight
of
me
in
all
that
glory
and
i
knew
it
nance
he
whispered
you
wonderful
girl
if
i
did
know
about
that
little
thief
up
at
the
bronsonia
i
i
marry
you
alive
just
for
the
fun
of
piling
pretty
things
on
you
the
deuce
you
would
i
sailed
past
him
with
topham
and
my
lord
in
my
wake
they
did
leave
me
till
they
stripped
me
clean
i
felt
like
a
christmas
tree
the
day
after
but
somehow
i
did
care
viii
is
that
you
mag
well
it
about
time
you
came
home
to
look
after
me
fine
chaperon
you
make
miss
monahan
why
did
i
tell
you
the
very
day
we
took
this
flat
what
a
chaperon
was
and
that
you
have
to
be
mine
imagine
nancy
olden
without
a
chaperon
shocking
no
is
late
sit
down
maggie
there
and
let
me
get
the
stool
and
talk
to
you
think
of
us
two
cruelty
girls
both
of
us
two
mangy
kittens
deserted
by
the
old
cats
in
a
city
alleys
and
left
mewing
with
cold
and
hunger
and
dirt
out
in
the
wet
think
of
us
two
in
our
own
flat
mag
i
say
it
makes
me
proud
of
us
there
are
times
when
i
look
at
every
stick
of
furniture
we
own
and
i
try
to
pretend
to
it
all
that
i
used
to
a
decent
roof
over
my
head
and
a
kitchen
parlor
bedroom
and
bath
oh
and
i
forgot
the
telephone
the
other
tenant
left
here
till
its
lease
is
up
but
at
other
times
i
stand
here
in
the
middle
of
it
and
cry
out
to
it
in
my
heart
look
at
me
nancy
olden
a
householder
a
the
head
of
the
family
even
if
it
only
a
family
of
two
and
the
other
one
mag
look
at
me
with
my
name
in
the
directory
milk
bills
and
meat
bills
and
bread
bills
look
at
me
with
a
place
of
my
own
where
nobody
right
greater
than
my
own
where
no
one
has
a
right
but
me
and
mag
a
place
where
where
there
nothing
to
hide
from
the
police
there
the
rub
mag
as
hamlet
says
i
went
to
see
it
the
other
night
so
that
i
could
take
off
the
ophelia
she
used
to
be
a
good
mimic
herself
before
she
tried
to
be
a
leading
lady
it
spoils
you
this
sense
of
safeness
that
goes
with
the
honesty
graft
you
lose
the
quickness
of
the
hunter
and
the
nerve
of
the
hunted
and
worse
you
lose
your
taste
for
the
old
risky
life
you
grow
proud
and
fat
and
you
love
every
stick
in
the
dear
quiet
little
place
that
your
home
your
own
home
you
love
it
so
that
you
be
ashamed
to
sneak
round
where
it
could
see
you
you
who
always
walked
upright
before
it
with
the
step
of
the
mistress
with
nothing
in
the
world
to
be
ashamed
of
nothing
to
prevent
your
staring
each
honest
in
the
face
and
mag
you
try
if
you
me
to
fit
tom
dorgan
in
here
tom
dorgan
in
stripes
and
savage
sulks
still
all
these
months
kept
away
from
the
world
even
the
world
behind
bars
maggie
do
you
wish
tom
was
a
ventriloquist
or
or
an
acrobat
or
but
this
is
what
i
had
to
tell
you
do
you
know
what
a
society
entertainer
is
miss
monahan
no
well
look
at
me
yes
i
one
miss
nance
olden
whose
services
are
worth
fifty
dollars
a
night
at
least
they
were
one
night
ginger
brought
me
the
note
that
made
me
a
society
entertainer
it
was
from
a
paul
b
gates
who
had
been
charmed
by
your
clever
impersonations
miss
olden
and
write
to
know
if
you
have
the
leisure
to
entertain
some
friends
at
my
house
on
thursday
of
this
week
had
i
the
leisure
well
rather
i
showed
the
note
to
gray
just
to
make
her
jealous
oh
yes
she
goes
on
all
right
in
the
act
with
lord
harold
every
night
catch
her
letting
me
wear
those
things
of
hers
twice
well
she
just
turned
up
her
nose
of
course
you
wo
accept
she
said
of
course
i
will
oh
i
only
thought
you
feel
as
i
should
about
appearing
before
a
lot
of
snobs
who
treat
you
like
a
servant
and
who
do
nothing
of
the
sort
and
who
pay
you
well
for
it
put
in
obermuller
he
had
come
up
and
was
reading
the
note
i
had
handed
to
him
you
just
say
yes
nance
he
went
on
after
gray
had
bounced
of
to
her
it
is
such
a
bad
graft
and
and
this
is
just
between
us
two
mind
that
little
beggar
tausig
has
begun
his
tricks
since
you
turned
his
offer
down
they
can
make
things
hot
for
me
and
if
they
do
it
wo
be
so
bad
for
you
to
go
in
for
this
sort
of
thing
unless
you
go
over
to
the
trust
i
shook
my
head
well
this
thing
will
be
an
ad
for
you
besides
if
the
papers
can
be
got
to
notice
it
they
coy
with
their
notices
confound
them
since
tausig
let
them
know
that
big
trust
ads
do
appear
in
the
same
papers
that
boom
shows
how
long
are
you
going
to
stand
it
mr
o
just
as
long
as
i
ca
help
myself
not
a
minute
longer
there
ought
to
be
a
way
some
way
yes
there
ought
but
there
is
they
got
things
down
to
a
fine
point
and
the
fellow
they
do
fear
has
got
to
fear
them
i
put
your
number
early
so
that
you
can
get
off
by
nine
good
luck
nance
at
nine
then
behold
nancy
olden
in
her
white
muslin
dress
and
and
just
to
her
with
a
big
white
muslin
sash
around
her
waist
oh
she
no
baby
is
nance
but
she
looks
like
one
in
this
rig
with
her
short
hair
or
rather
like
a
which
makes
the
stunts
she
does
in
mimicking
the
corkers
of
the
profession
all
the
more
surprising
we
just
a
little
party
said
paul
gates
coming
into
the
bedroom
where
i
was
taking
of
my
wraps
and
i
so
glad
you
could
come
for
my
principal
guest
latimer
is
an
invalid
who
used
to
love
the
theaters
but
has
been
to
one
since
his
attack
many
years
ago
i
count
on
your
giving
him
in
a
way
a
condensed
history
in
action
of
what
is
going
on
on
the
stage
i
told
her
i
would
but
i
did
just
know
what
i
was
saying
think
of
latimer
there
maggie
and
think
of
our
last
meeting
it
made
me
tremble
not
that
i
fancied
for
a
moment
he
betray
me
the
man
that
helps
you
twice
do
hurt
you
the
third
time
no
it
was
that
it
was
only
that
i
longed
to
do
well
well
before
him
so
that
and
then
i
found
myself
in
an
alcove
off
the
parlors
separated
from
them
by
heavy
curtains
it
was
such
a
pretty
little
red
bower
right
behind
me
was
the
red
of
the
turkish
drapery
of
a
cozy
corner
and
just
as
i
took
my
place
under
the
great
chandelier
the
servants
pulled
the
curtains
apart
and
the
lights
went
out
in
the
parlors
in
that
minute
i
got
it
mag
yes
stage
fright
got
it
bad
i
suppose
it
was
coming
to
me
but
lordy
i
had
ever
known
before
what
it
was
i
could
see
the
black
of
the
men
clothes
in
the
long
parlors
in
front
of
me
and
the
white
of
the
women
necks
and
arms
there
were
soft
ends
of
talk
trailing
after
the
first
silence
and
everything
was
so
strange
that
i
seemed
to
hear
two
men
voices
which
sounded
familiar
latimer
silken
voice
and
another
a
heavy
coarse
bass
that
was
the
last
to
be
quieted
i
fancied
that
when
that
last
voice
should
stop
i
could
begin
but
all
at
once
my
mind
seemed
to
turn
a
somersault
and
instead
of
looking
out
upon
them
i
seemed
to
be
looking
in
on
myself
to
see
a
little
girl
in
a
white
dress
standing
alone
under
a
blaze
of
light
in
a
glare
of
red
gazing
fearfully
at
this
queer
new
audience
fail
me
not
nancy
maggie
i
just
took
me
by
the
shoulders
nancy
olden
you
little
thief
i
cried
to
me
inside
of
me
how
dare
you
i
rather
you
steal
the
silver
on
this
woman
than
cheat
her
out
of
what
she
expects
and
what
coming
to
her
nance
really
did
dare
so
she
began
the
first
one
was
bad
i
gave
duse
francesca
you
never
heard
the
wailing
music
in
that
woman
voice
when
she
says
there
is
no
escape
smaragdi
you
have
said
it
the
shadow
is
a
glass
to
me
and
god
lets
me
be
lost
i
gave
them
duse
just
to
show
them
how
swell
i
was
myself
which
shows
what
a
ninny
i
was
the
thing
the
world
loves
is
the
opposite
of
what
it
is
the
of
their
gloves
came
in
to
me
when
i
got
through
they
were
too
polite
to
hiss
but
it
was
necessary
i
was
hissing
myself
inside
of
me
there
was
a
long
nasty
i
could
bear
it
i
could
bear
to
be
a
failure
with
latimer
listening
though
out
there
in
that
queer
i
could
see
him
at
all
but
could
only
make
out
the
couch
where
i
knew
he
must
be
lying
i
just
jumped
into
something
else
to
retrieve
myself
i
can
do
carter
du
barry
to
the
queen
taste
maggie
that
rotten
voice
of
hers
like
mother
douty
but
stronger
and
surer
that
rocky
old
face
pretending
to
look
young
and
beautiful
inside
that
talented
red
hair
of
hers
that
whining
denny
denny
she
squawks
out
every
other
minute
oh
i
can
do
du
barry
all
right
they
thought
i
could
too
those
black
and
white
shadows
out
there
on
the
other
side
of
the
velvet
curtains
but
i
cared
less
for
what
they
thought
than
for
the
fact
that
i
had
drowned
that
sputtering
inside
of
me
and
that
latimer
was
among
them
i
gave
them
warfield
then
i
was
always
good
at
taking
off
the
sheenies
in
the
alley
behind
the
cruelty
remember
i
gave
them
that
little
maude
adams
and
dry
corking
little
fiske
and
henry
miller
when
he
smooths
down
his
white
breeches
lovingly
and
sings
sally
in
our
alley
and
strutting
old
mansfield
and
say
is
it
funny
mag
that
i
seen
all
and
know
all
they
can
do
they
been
my
college
education
that
crowd
not
a
bad
one
either
when
you
come
to
think
of
what
i
wanted
from
it
they
pulled
the
curtains
down
at
the
end
and
i
went
back
to
the
bedroom
i
had
my
hat
and
jacket
on
when
gates
and
some
of
the
younger
ladies
came
to
see
me
there
but
i
caught
no
glimpse
of
latimer
you
think
would
you
that
he
have
made
an
opportunity
to
say
just
one
nice
word
to
me
in
that
easy
soft
voice
of
his
i
tried
to
believe
that
perhaps
he
had
really
seen
me
lying
down
as
he
must
have
been
or
that
he
had
recognized
me
but
i
knew
that
i
could
make
myself
believe
that
and
the
lack
of
just
that
word
from
him
spoiled
all
my
satisfaction
with
myself
and
i
walked
out
with
gates
through
the
hall
and
past
the
feeling
as
hurt
as
though
i
deserved
that
a
man
like
latimer
should
notice
me
the
was
all
lighted
but
empty
the
colored
shaded
candlesticks
glowing
down
on
the
cut
glass
and
silver
on
delicate
china
and
flowers
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
had
come
out
to
supper
yet
at
least
only
one
was
there
he
was
standing
with
his
back
to
me
before
the
sideboard
pouring
out
a
glass
of
something
from
a
decanter
he
turned
at
the
rustle
of
my
starched
skirt
and
as
i
passed
the
door
he
saw
me
i
saw
him
too
and
hurried
away
yes
i
knew
him
just
you
wait
i
got
home
here
earlier
than
i
expected
and
i
just
got
off
my
hat
and
jacket
and
put
away
that
snug
little
check
when
there
came
a
ring
at
the
bell
i
thought
it
was
you
mag
that
you
forgotten
your
key
i
was
so
sure
of
it
that
i
pulled
the
door
open
wide
with
a
flourish
and
and
admitted
edward
yes
edward
husband
of
the
dowager
the
same
old
fellow
with
whisky
now
just
as
he
was
before
he
must
have
been
keeping
it
up
steadily
ever
since
the
day
out
in
the
country
when
tom
lifted
his
watch
it
take
more
than
one
lost
watch
to
cure
edward
i
followed
you
home
miss
murieson
he
said
grabbing
me
by
the
hand
and
pushing
the
door
closed
behind
him
or
is
it
miss
murieson
which
is
your
stage
name
and
which
your
real
one
and
have
you
really
learned
to
remember
it
for
my
part
any
old
name
will
smell
as
sweet
now
that
i
close
to
the
rose
i
jerked
my
hand
away
from
him
i
did
ask
you
to
call
i
said
haughty
as
the
dowager
herself
was
when
first
i
saw
her
in
her
gorgeous
parlor
the
bishop
card
in
her
hand
no
i
noticed
that
he
roared
jovially
you
skinned
out
the
front
door
the
moment
you
saw
me
all
that
was
left
to
me
was
to
skin
after
why
why
he
slapped
his
leg
as
though
he
heard
the
best
joke
in
the
world
to
renew
our
acquaintance
of
course
to
ask
you
if
you
would
like
me
to
buy
you
a
red
coat
and
hat
like
the
one
you
left
behind
you
that
day
over
in
philadelphia
when
you
cut
your
visit
so
short
to
insist
upon
my
privilege
of
relationship
to
call
that
wink
you
gave
me
in
the
hall
that
day
you
little
devil
now
do
look
at
me
like
that
i
say
let
be
friends
wo
you
not
for
a
red
coat
trimmed
with
chinchilla
i
cried
he
got
between
me
and
the
door
prices
gone
up
he
inquired
pleasantly
who
bulling
the
stock
never
you
mind
so
long
as
his
name
is
ramsay
but
why
should
his
name
be
ramsay
he
cooed
just
because
it
is
i
expecting
a
friend
had
you
better
go
home
to
dowager
diamonds
bully
is
that
what
you
call
her
no
i
stay
and
meet
your
friend
better
not
oh
i
not
afraid
does
he
know
as
much
about
you
as
i
do
more
about
your
weakness
for
other
girls
coats
yes
you
do
know
it
all
do
you
and
yet
you
care
for
me
maggie
monahan
i
retreated
before
him
into
the
what
in
the
world
to
do
to
get
rid
of
him
i
think
you
better
go
home
ramsay
i
said
again
decidedly
if
you
do
i
have
to
call
the
janitor
to
put
you
out
call
sweetheart
he
put
you
out
with
me
for
i
tell
him
a
thing
or
two
about
you
and
we
go
and
find
a
better
place
than
this
stock
ca
be
quoted
so
high
after
all
if
this
is
the
best
prospectus
your
friend
can
put
up
why
do
you
call
i
looked
at
him
i
was
thinking
well
he
demanded
i
changed
my
mind
oh
mag
mag
did
you
ever
see
the
man
ugly
as
a
cannibal
he
may
be
and
old
as
the
cannibal
that
could
be
persuaded
he
was
a
his
manner
changed
altogether
he
plumped
down
on
the
lounge
and
patted
the
place
beside
him
invitingly
giving
me
a
wink
that
was
deadly
but
mrs
dowager
i
exclaimed
coquettishly
oh
that
all
right
little
one
she
has
even
missed
me
yet
when
she
playing
bridge
she
forgets
even
to
be
jealous
playing
bridge
i
murmured
sweetly
off
in
philadelphia
while
you
you
naughty
man
oh
he
loved
that
not
so
naughty
as
as
i
like
to
be
he
bellowed
heavily
witty
and
she
is
off
in
philadelphia
either
she
just
round
the
corner
at
gates
and
what
the
matter
nothing
nothing
did
she
recognize
me
oh
that
what
scared
you
is
it
she
did
recognize
you
neither
did
i
till
i
got
that
second
glimpse
of
you
with
your
hat
and
jacket
on
but
even
if
she
had
ho
ho
ho
i
say
do
you
know
you
could
convince
the
bishop
and
henrietta
if
you
talk
till
doomsday
that
that
red
coat
and
hat
we
advertised
were
taken
by
a
little
girl
that
was
daffy
fact
i
swear
it
they
admit
you
took
the
coat
you
little
witch
but
it
was
when
you
were
out
of
your
mind
of
course
of
course
very
fact
that
she
left
the
coat
behind
her
and
took
nothing
else
from
the
house
shows
a
mind
diseased
insisted
henrietta
of
course
of
course
her
coming
for
no
reason
at
all
to
your
house
adds
the
bishop
say
what
was
the
reason
maggie
i
tell
you
a
hard
thing
it
is
when
people
think
worse
of
you
than
you
are
but
better
that
you
feel
most
uncomfortable
i
got
pale
and
sick
inside
of
me
at
the
thought
of
my
poor
little
bishop
i
loved
him
for
believing
me
straight
and
i
been
dying
of
curiosity
to
know
what
was
in
your
wise
little
head
that
day
he
went
on
oh
it
was
wise
all
right
that
wink
you
gave
me
was
perfectly
sane
there
was
method
in
that
madness
of
yours
i
will
tell
you
ramsay
i
said
sweetly
at
supper
supper
yes
the
supper
you
going
to
get
for
me
his
bellowing
laughter
filled
the
place
maggie
our
little
flat
and
our
few
things
do
go
well
with
sounds
like
that
oh
you
all
alike
you
women
he
roared
all
right
supper
it
is
where
shall
we
go
rector
i
pouted
it
so
much
more
cozy
right
here
i
said
i
telephone
brophy
just
round
the
corner
and
they
send
in
the
loveliest
things
oh
they
do
well
tell
to
begin
sending
i
thought
he
follow
me
out
in
the
hall
to
the
but
he
was
having
some
trouble
in
pulling
out
his
purse
to
count
out
his
money
i
suppose
i
got
central
and
asked
for
the
number
oh
yes
i
knew
it
all
right
i
had
called
up
that
same
number
once
already
brophy
why
maggie
monahan
you
ought
to
know
there
no
brophy
at
least
none
that
i
ever
heard
about
with
my
hand
over
the
mouthpiece
so
that
nobody
heard
but
edward
i
ordered
a
supper
fit
for
a
king
or
a
chorus
girl
what
did
i
order
champagne
broiled
lobster
crab
meat
stuffed
pimentoes
kirschkaffee
everything
i
ever
heard
beryl
blackburn
tell
about
say
say
interrupted
edward
coming
out
after
me
that
enough
of
that
stuff
tell
him
to
send
in
a
scotch
and
soda
and
what
for
at
that
moment
the
connection
was
made
and
i
cut
in
sweetly
with
edward
ramsay
just
a
minute
mag
you
should
have
seen
the
man
face
it
was
red
it
was
white
it
was
furious
it
was
frightened
i
put
my
hand
a
moment
over
the
mouthpiece
and
turned
on
him
then
i
got
her
on
the
at
gates
house
shall
i
tell
your
wife
where
you
are
edward
just
a
moment
ramsay
hold
the
wire
some
one
wants
to
speak
with
you
you
little
devil
his
voice
was
thick
with
rage
yes
you
called
me
that
some
time
ago
but
not
in
that
tone
quick
now
the
door
or
waiting
mrs
ramsay
he
moved
toward
the
door
how
i
know
you
wo
tell
her
when
i
gone
he
growled
merely
by
my
saying
that
i
wo
i
answered
curtly
you
in
no
position
to
dictate
terms
i
am
but
i
could
without
leaving
the
latch
the
chain
on
the
door
behind
him
leaving
it
half
open
so
he
must
have
heard
the
rest
yes
ramsay
waiting
i
croaked
like
the
driest
kind
of
i
was
mistaken
it
was
a
message
left
to
be
delivered
to
you
not
some
one
wanting
to
speak
with
you
who
am
i
why
this
is
central
here
is
the
message
be
with
you
in
half
an
hour
signed
yes
that
right
thank
you
good
night
i
hung
up
gave
the
door
a
touch
that
shut
it
in
his
face
and
went
back
into
the
to
throw
open
the
windows
the
place
smelled
of
alcohol
the
moral
atmosphere
left
behind
by
that
bad
old
man
sickened
me
i
leaned
out
and
looked
at
the
stars
and
tried
to
think
of
something
sweet
and
wholesome
and
strengthening
ah
nance
i
cried
to
myself
with
a
sob
i
had
pretended
to
take
it
lightly
enough
when
he
was
here
but
now
if
you
had
heard
of
a
girl
who
like
yourself
this
evening
unexpectedly
met
two
men
she
had
known
and
the
good
man
ignored
her
and
the
bad
one
followed
her
oh
nancy
what
sort
of
girl
would
you
think
she
was
at
heart
what
sort
of
hope
could
you
imagine
her
treasuring
for
her
own
future
and
what
sort
of
significance
would
you
attach
to
and
just
then
the
bell
rang
again
this
time
i
was
sure
it
was
you
and
o
maggie
i
ran
to
the
door
eager
for
the
touch
of
your
hand
and
the
look
in
your
eyes
i
was
afraid
to
be
alone
with
my
own
thoughts
i
was
afraid
of
the
conclusion
to
which
they
were
leading
me
maggie
if
ever
a
girl
needed
comfort
and
encouragement
and
heartening
i
did
then
and
i
got
it
dear
for
there
was
a
man
at
the
door
with
a
great
basket
of
azaleas
pale
pink
they
are
the
sweet
innocent
things
and
a
letter
for
me
here
it
is
let
me
read
it
to
you
my
dear
miss
omar
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
luckless
pot
marred
in
the
making
that
had
the
luck
to
be
of
service
to
a
pipkin
it
was
a
saucy
pipkin
though
a
very
winning
one
and
it
had
all
the
health
and
strength
the
poor
pot
lacked
physically
morally
morally
that
young
pipkin
was
in
a
most
unwholesome
condition
already
its
fair
smooth
surface
was
scratched
and
fouled
it
was
unmindful
of
the
treasure
of
good
it
contained
and
its
responsibility
to
keep
that
good
intact
and
it
seemed
destined
to
crash
itself
to
pieces
among
pots
of
baser
metal
what
the
luckless
pot
did
was
little
being
ignorant
of
the
art
by
which
diamonds
may
be
attained
easily
and
honestly
but
it
gave
the
little
pipkin
a
chance
what
the
pipkin
did
with
that
chance
the
pot
learned
with
such
pleasure
and
satisfaction
as
made
it
impossible
for
him
not
to
share
it
with
her
so
while
he
sent
burnett
out
to
the
conservatory
to
cut
azaleas
he
wrote
her
a
note
to
try
to
convey
to
her
what
he
felt
when
in
that
nicely
polished
neatly
decorated
and
vessel
on
exhibition
in
gates
red
room
he
recognized
the
poor
little
pipkin
of
other
days
the
pot
as
you
know
was
a
sort
of
stranded
bit
of
clay
that
had
never
filled
the
use
for
which
pots
are
created
he
had
little
human
to
interest
him
the
fate
of
the
pipkin
therefore
he
had
often
pondered
on
and
in
spite
of
improbabilities
had
had
faith
in
a
certain
quality
of
brave
sincerity
the
little
thing
showed
a
quality
that
shone
through
acquired
faults
like
a
star
in
a
murky
sky
this
justification
of
his
faith
in
the
pipkin
may
seem
a
small
matter
to
make
so
much
of
and
yet
the
pot
that
sleeps
not
well
o
nights
as
is
the
case
with
damaged
pots
will
take
to
bed
with
him
a
pretty
pleasant
thought
due
just
to
this
but
do
not
think
the
pot
an
idealist
if
he
were
he
might
have
been
tempted
to
mistake
the
pipkin
for
a
statelier
more
pretentious
vessel
a
vase
say
all
graceful
curves
and
embossed
sides
but
shallow
perhaps
possibly
lacking
breadth
no
the
pipkin
is
a
pipkin
made
of
common
clay
even
though
it
has
the
uncommon
sweetness
and
strength
to
overcome
the
tendencies
of
clay
and
fashioned
for
those
common
uses
of
life
deprivation
of
which
to
anything
that
comes
from
the
potter
hands
is
the
most
enduring
the
most
uncommon
sorrow
o
pretty
little
pipkin
thank
the
potter
who
made
you
as
you
are
as
you
will
be
a
thing
that
can
cheer
and
stay
men
souls
by
ministering
to
the
human
needs
of
them
for
you
be
sure
the
potter
good
fellow
and
all
be
well
for
the
pot
he
sails
shortly
or
rather
he
is
to
be
carted
abroad
by
some
optimistic
friends
whose
hopes
he
does
not
share
to
a
celebrated
repair
shop
for
damaged
pots
whether
he
shall
return
patched
and
mended
into
temporary
semblance
of
a
useful
vessel
whether
he
shall
continue
to
be
merely
the
same
old
luckless
pot
or
whether
he
shall
return
at
all
o
pipkin
does
not
matter
much
but
it
has
been
well
that
before
we
two
behind
the
veil
had
passed
we
met
again
and
you
left
me
such
a
fragrant
memory
latimer
o
maggie
maggie
some
day
i
hope
to
see
that
man
and
tell
him
how
sorely
the
pipkin
needed
the
pot
letter
ix
it
all
come
so
quick
maggie
and
it
was
over
so
soon
that
i
hardly
remember
the
beginning
nobody
on
earth
could
have
expected
it
less
than
i
when
i
came
off
in
the
afternoon
i
do
know
what
i
was
thinking
of
as
i
came
into
my
that
used
to
be
gray
the
sight
of
him
seemed
to
cut
me
off
from
myself
as
with
a
knife
but
it
was
of
him
it
may
have
been
that
i
was
chuckling
to
myself
at
the
thought
of
nancy
olden
with
a
all
to
herself
i
ca
ever
quite
get
used
to
that
you
know
though
i
sail
around
there
with
all
the
airs
of
the
leading
lady
sometimes
i
see
a
twinkle
in
fred
obermuller
eye
when
i
catch
him
watching
me
and
goodness
knows
he
been
glum
enough
of
late
but
it
was
yes
i
going
to
tell
you
but
it
rattled
me
a
bit
maggie
so
so
sorry
and
a
little
oh
just
a
little
little
bit
glad
i
slammed
the
door
behind
me
the
old
place
is
out
of
repair
and
the
door
wo
shut
except
with
a
bang
and
i
had
just
squatted
down
on
the
floor
to
unbutton
my
high
shoes
when
i
noticed
the
chintz
curtains
in
front
of
the
high
waver
they
must
have
moved
just
like
that
when
i
was
behind
them
months
it
seems
years
ago
but
you
see
topham
had
never
served
an
apprenticeship
behind
curtains
so
he
suspect
lordy
nancy
i
laughed
to
myself
some
one
thinks
you
got
a
rose
diamond
and
and
at
that
moment
he
parted
the
curtains
and
came
out
yes
tom
tom
dorgan
my
heart
came
beating
up
to
my
throat
and
then
just
as
i
thought
i
should
choke
it
slid
down
to
my
boots
sickening
me
i
did
say
a
word
i
sat
there
my
foot
in
my
lap
staring
at
him
oh
it
is
good
to
get
your
first
glimpse
after
all
these
months
of
the
man
you
love
crouched
like
a
big
bull
in
a
small
space
poking
his
black
head
out
like
a
turtle
that
not
sure
something
wo
be
thrown
at
it
and
then
dragging
his
big
bulk
out
and
standing
over
you
he
used
to
be
trim
tom
and
taut
but
in
those
shapeless
things
the
old
trousers
the
dirty
white
shirt
and
the
vest
too
big
for
him
well
he
said
why
do
you
say
something
tom
voice
mag
do
you
remember
the
merry
irish
boy
voice
with
its
chuckles
like
a
brook
gurgling
as
it
runs
no
is
the
same
voice
it
it
changed
maggie
it
heavy
and
and
coarse
and
brutal
that
what
it
is
it
sounds
like
like
the
knout
like
nance
what
in
hell
i
think
i
frightened
tom
oh
the
ladyfied
airs
of
her
ai

to
faint
miss
olden
i
got
up
no

down

me
about
it
how
how
did
you
get
here
he
went
to
the
door
opened
it
a
bit
and
looked
out
cautiously
mag
mag
it
hurt
me
that
why
do
you
suppose
you
sure
nobody
come
in
he
asked
i
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
forgetting
that
it
did
really
lock
oh
yes
i
sure
i
said
why
why
you
have
got
slow
just
because
i
did
say
to
them
fellows
up
at
the
pen
and
oh
you
escaped
that
what
first
in
fifteen
years

d
think
of
your
tommy
old
girl
eh
ai
he
the
gamest
ai
you
proud
of
him
my
god
mag
proud
of
him

did
know
he
could
see
himself
he
shut
in
like
a
wild
beast
could
see
what
this
year
has
done
for
him
oh
the
change
the
change
in
him
my
boy
tommy
with
the
gay
gallus
manner
and
the
pretty
jolly
brogue
and
the
laughing
mouth
under
his
brown
mustache
and
this
man
his
face
is
old
mag
old
oh
and
hard
and
and
tough
cheap
and
tough
there
something
in
his
eyes
now
and
about
his
shaven
mouth
oh
maggie
maggie
look
here
nance
he
caught
me
by
the
shoulders
knocking
up
my
chin
so
that
he
could
look
down
squarely
at
me
what
your
graft
it
to
be
between
us
what
ye
been
doing
all
this
time
out
with
it
i
want
to
know
i
shook
myself
free
and
faced
him
i
been
tom
dorgan
i
been
to
hear
the
greatest
actors
and
actresses
in
the
world
say
and
do
the
finest
things
in
the
world
watched
princesses
and
kings
even
if
they
only
stage
ones
read
a
new
book
every
night
a
great
picture
book
in
which
the
pictures
move
and
speak
that
the
stage
tom
dorgan
much
of
it
was
true
but
a
girl
who
been
brought
up
by
the
cruelty
have
to
be
told
what
true
and
what
false
i
met
these
people
and
lived
with
them
as
one
does
who
thinks
the
same
thoughts
and
feels
what
others
feel
i
know
the
world
now
tom
dorgan
the
real
world
of
men
and
women
not
the
little
world
of
crooks
nor
yet
the
littler
one
of
fairy
stories
i
got
a
glimpse
too
of
that
other
world
where
all
the
scheming
and
lying
and
cheating
is
changed
as
if
by
magic
into
something
that
deceives
all
right
but
does
hurt
it
the
world
of
art
and
artists
tom
dorgan
where
people
paint
their
lies
or
write
them
or
act
them
where
they
lift
money
all
right
from
men
pockets
but
lift
their
souls
and
their
lives
too
away
from
the
things
that
trouble
and
bore
and
and
degrade
you
need
sneer
it
made
a
different
nance
out
of
me
tom
dorgan
and
oh
but
i
sorry
for
the
pert
little
beggar
we
both
knew
that
lied
and
stole
and
hid
and
ran
and
skulked
she
was
like
a
poor
little
ignorant
traveler
in
a
great
country
where
she
sized
up
the
world
from
the
few
fool

she
was
thrown
in
with
she
aw
cut
it
tom
does
does
it
mean
anything
to
you
ca
it
mean
lots
to
both
of
us
now
that
cut
it
i
tell
you
think
i
killed
one
guard
and
beat
the
other
till
i
broke
every
bone
in
his
body
to
come
here
and
listen
to
such
guff
you
been
having
a
high
old
time
eh
and
you
never
give
a
thought
to
me
up
there
i
might
rotted
in
that
black
hole
for
all
you
care
you
do
i
did
tom
i
did
i
was
shivering
at
the
name
but
i
could
bear
his
thinking
that
way
of
me
i
went
up
once
but
they
would
let
me
see
you
i
wrote
you
but
they
sent
back
the
letters
mag
went
up
too
but
had
to
come
back
and
that
time
i
brought
you
my
voice
trailed
off
in
that
minute
i
saw
myself
on
the
way
up
to
sing
sing
with
the
basket
and
all
my
hopes
and
all
my
schemes
for
amusing
him
and
this
is
what
i
have
seen
if
they
let
me
in
this
big
gruff
murdering
beast
oh
yes
yes
beast
is
what
he
is
and
it
did
make
him
look
it
less
that
he
believed
me
and
and
began
to
think
of
me
in
a
different
way
i
thought
you
would
go
back
on
a
feller
nance
that
why
i
come
straight
to
you
it
was
my
game
to
have
you
hide
me
for
a
day
or
two
till
you
could
make
a
strike
somewhere
and
we
light
out
together
how
ye
fixed
pretty
smart
eh
you
look
it
my
girl
you
look
my
eye
nance
you
look
good
enough
to
eat
and
i
hungry
for
you
maggie
if
i
had
to
die
for
it
i
could
have
moved
then
think
a
man
would
know
when
the
woman
he
holding
in
his
arms
is
fainting
sick
at
the
touch
of
him
a
woman
would
it
was
my
tom
that
i
known
that
i
worked
with
and
played
with
and
it
was
a
great
brute
whose
mouth
who
had
no
eyes
no
ears
no
senses
but
ah
he
laughed
when
i
broke
away
from
him
at
last
he
laughed
and
i
knew
then
i
have
to
tell
him
straight
in
words
tom
i
gasped
you
can
have
all
i
got
and
it
plenty
to
get
you
out
of
the
way
but
but
you
ca
have
me
any
more
that
done
oh
the
beast
in
his
face
it
must
have
looked
like
that
when
the
guard
got
his
last
glimpse
of
it
you
kiddin
me
he
growled
i
shook
my
head
then
he
ripped
it
out
said
the
worst
he
could
and
ended
with
a
curse
the
blood
boiled
in
me
the
old
nance
never
stood
that
she
used
to
sneer
at
other
women
who
did
get
out
of
here
i
cried
go
go
tom
dorgan
i
send
every
cent
i
got
to
you
to
mother
douty
within
two
hours
but
do
you
dare
do
you
dare
you
just
make
up
your
mind
to
drop
these
newfangled
airs
and
mighty
quick
i
tell
you
you
come
with
me
i
need
you
and
i
want
you
and
i
want
you
now
and
i
keep
you
when
once
i
get
you
again
we
hang
together
no
more
o
this
for
me
where
you
get
all
the
soft
and
it
me
for
the
hard
you
belong
to
me
yes
you
do
just
think
back
a
bit
nance
olden
and
remember
the
kind
of
customer
i
am
if
you
forgot
just
let
me
remind
you
that
what
i
know
would
put
you
behind
bars
my
lady
and
it
shall
i
swear
if
i
got
to
go
to
the
chair
for
it
tom
it
was
tom
talking
that
way
to
me
i
could
bear
it
i
made
a
rush
for
the
door
he
got
there
too
and
catching
me
by
the
shoulder
he
lifted
his
fist
but
it
never
fell
mag
i
think
i
could
kill
a
man
who
struck
me
but
just
as
i
shut
my
eyes
and
shivered
away
from
him
while
i
waited
for
the
blow
a
knock
came
at
the
door
and
fred
obermuller
walked
in
eh
oh
excuse
me
i
did
know
there
was
anybody
else
nance
your
face
is
ghastly
what
up
he
said
sharply
he
looked
from
me
to
tom
tom
standing
off
there
ready
to
spring
on
him
to
dart
past
him
to
fly
out
of
the
window
ready
for
anything
only
waiting
to
know
what
the
thing
was
to
be
my
senses
came
back
to
me
then
the
sight
of
obermuller
with
those
keen
quick
eyes
behind
his
glasses
his
strong
square
chin
and
the
whole
poise
of
his
head
and
body
that
makes
men
wait
to
hear
what
he
has
to
say
the
knowledge
that
that
man
was
my
friend
mine
nancy
olden
lifted
me
out
of
the
mud
i
sunk
back
in
and
put
my
feet
again
on
a
level
with
his
tom
i
said
slowly
obermuller
is
a
friend
of
mine
no
listen
what
we
been
talking
about
is
settled
do
bring
it
up
again
it
does
interest
him
and
it
ca
change
me
i
swear
to
you
it
ca
nothing
can
i
going
to
ask
obermuller
to
help
you
without
telling
him
just
what
the
scrape
is
and
and
i
going
to
be
sure
that
he
do
it
just
because
he
because
you
taken
up
with
him
have
you
tom
shouted
savagely
because
she
your
tom
i
cried
tom
oh
yes
now
i
remember
obermuller
got
between
us
as
he
spoke
your
friend
up
in
the
country
that
you
went
to
see
and
could
not
a
very
your
friend
nance
but
farming
i
suppose
tom
plays
the
deuce
with
one
looks
and
another
thing
it
does
it
makes
a
man
forget
sometimes
just
how
to
behave
in
town
be
charmed
tom
to
oblige
a
friend
of
miss
olden
but
i
must
insist
that
he
does
not
talk
like
a
farmer
he
was
quite
close
to
tom
when
he
finished
and
tom
was
glaring
up
at
him
and
mag
i
did
know
which
one
i
was
most
afraid
for
you
look
at
me
that
way
mag
monahan
and
do
you
dare
to
guess
anything
if
you
think
growled
tom
that
i
going
to
let
you
get
off
with
the
girl
you
mighty
now
i
told
you
not
to
say
that
the
reason
i
do
the
thing
she
going
to
ask
of
me
if
it
what
i
think
it
is
is
because
this
girl
a
plucky
little
creature
with
a
soul
big
enough
to
lift
her
out
of
the
muck
you
probably
helped
her
into
it
because
she
got
brains
talent
and
a
heart
it
because
well
it
because
i
feel
like
it
and
she
deserves
a
friend
you
do
know
what
she
is
it
was
a
snarl
from
tom
you
do
oh
yes
i
do
you
cur
i
know
what
she
was
too
and
i
even
know
what
she
will
be
but
that
does
concern
you
the
hell
it
do
obermuller
turned
his
back
on
him
i
was
dumb
and
still
tom
dorgan
had
struck
me
after
all
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
do
nance
obermuller
asked
get
him
away
on
a
steamer
quick
i
murmured
i
could
look
him
in
the
face
without
asking
why
or
what
his
name
is
he
turned
to
tom
well
i
wo
go
not
without
her
because
you
so
fond
of
her
eh
so
fond
your
first
thought
on
quitting
the
country
was
to
come
here
to
get
her
in
trouble
if
been
traced
ah
you
would
like
that
eh
sneered
tom
would
you
well
i
had
my
share
of
it
and
she
ai
still
i
just
what
would
it
be
worth
to
you
to
have
me
out
of
the
way
oh
tom
tom
i
cried
but
obermuller
got
in
front
of
me
it
would
be
worth
exactly
one
dollar
and
cents
i
think
it
will
amount
to
about
that
for
i
guess
the
cars
are
any
too
safe
for
you
or
it
might
be
less
it
may
amount
to
something
more
before
i
get
you
shipped
before
the
mast
on
the
first
boat
but
what
more
important
he
added
bringing
his
fist
down
with
a
mighty
thump
on
the
table
you
have
just
ten
seconds
to
make
up
your
mind
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
ring
for
the
police
i
went
down
to
the
boat
to
see
it
sail
mag
at
seven
this
morning
no
not
to
say
to
him
he
did
know
i
was
there
it
was
to
say
to
my
old
tommy
the
one
i
loved
truly
i
did
love
him
mag
though
he
never
cared
for
me
no
he
did
men
do
pull
down
the
women
they
love
i
know
that
now
if
tom
dorgan
had
ever
cared
for
me
he
would
have
made
a
thief
of
me
if
he
cared
the
last
place
on
earth
he
have
come
to
when
he
knew
the
detectives
would
be
on
his
track
would
have
been
just
the
first
place
he
made
for
if
cared
he
but
it
done
mag
it
all
over
cheap
that
what
he
is
this
tom
dorgan
cheaply
bad
a
cheap
bully
remember
my
wishing
he
have
been
a
ventriloquist
why
that
man
that
tried
to
sell
me
to
obermuller
has
sense
enough
to
be
a
good
oh
the
firm
of
dorgan
olden
is
dissolved
mag
the
retiring
partner
has
gone
into
the
theatrical
business
as
for
dorgan
the
real
one
poor
fellow
jolly
handsome
big
tom
dorgan
he
died
yes
he
died
maggie
and
was
buried
up
there
in
the
prison
graveyard
a
hard
lot
for
a
boy
but
it
not
the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
to
him
he
might
become
a
man
such
a
man
as
that
fellow
that
sailed
away
before
the
mast
this
morning
x
there
i
was
seated
in
a
box
all
alone
miss
nancy
olden
by
courtesy
of
the
management
come
to
listen
to
the
leading
lady
sing
that
i
might
add
her
to
my
collection
of
she
a
fat
leading
lady
very
fair
and
nearly
fifty
i
guess
but
she
got
a
rollicking
husky
voice
in
her
fat
throat
that
sung
the
dollars
down
deep
into
her
pockets
they
say
she
planted
them
deeper
still
in
the
foundations
of
apartment
houses
and
that
now
she
the
richest
on
the
rialto
do
you
know
maggie
darlin
what
i
was
saying
to
myself
there
in
the
box
while
i
watched
the
stage
and
waited
for
obermuller
he
said
drop
in
later
perhaps
nance
i
said
i
kind
of
fancy
that
apartment
sort
of
idea
myself
they
tell
you
nancy
that
when
you
got
the
artistic
temperament
that
that
all
you
ever
have
but
there
a
chance
one
in
a
hundred
for
a
body
to
get
that
temperament
mixed
with
a
business
instinct
it
does
often
happen
but
when
it
does
the
result
is
dollars
it
may
be
nance
i
shrewdly
suspect
it
is
a
fact
that
you
got
that
marvelous
mixture
your
early
successes
miss
olden
in
another
profession
that
i
need
name
would
encourage
the
idea
that
you
not
all
heart
and
no
head
i
think
nance
i
shall
have
you
mimic
the
artists
during
working
hours
and
the
business
men
when
you
at
play
i
fancy
apartment
houses
they
appeal
to
me
call
one
nancy
and
another
hall
and
another
what
i
call
the
third
apartment
house
mr
o
i
asked
aloud
as
i
heard
the
rings
on
the
portiere
behind
me
click
he
did
answer
without
turning
my
head
i
repeated
the
question
and
yet
suddenly
before
he
could
have
answered
i
knew
something
was
wrong
i
turned
and
in
that
moment
a
man
took
the
seat
beside
me
and
another
stood
facing
me
with
his
back
against
the
portieres
miss
olden
the
man
beside
me
asked
yes
nance
olden
the
mimic
who
entertains
at
private
houses
i
nodded
you
you
were
at
paul
gates
just
a
week
ago
and
you
gave
your
specialties
there
yes
yes
what
is
it
you
want
he
was
a
little
man
but
very
muscular
i
could
note
the
play
of
his
muscles
even
in
the
slight
motion
he
made
as
he
turned
his
body
so
as
to
get
between
me
and
the
audience
while
he
leaned
toward
me
watching
me
intently
with
his
small
quick
blue
eyes
we
do
want
to
make
any
scene
here
he
said
very
low
we
want
to
do
it
up
as
quietly
as
we
can
there
might
be
some
mistake
you
know
and
then
you
be
sorry
so
should
we
i
hope
you
be
reasonable
and
it
be
all
the
better
for
you
because
what
are
you
talk
what
i
looked
from
him
to
the
other
fellow
behind
us
he
leaned
a
bit
farther
forward
then
and
pulling
his
coat
partly
open
he
showed
me
a
detective
badge
and
the
other
man
quickly
did
the
same
i
sat
back
in
my
chair
the
fat
star
on
the
stage
with
her
big
mouth
and
big
was
doing
a
up
and
down
close
to
the
footlights
yelling
the
chorus
of
her
song
i
never
mimic
that
song
mag
although
i
can
see
her
and
hear
it
as
plain
as
though
i
listened
and
watched
her
all
my
life
but
no
fun
in
it
for
me
i
hate
the
very
bars
the
orchestra
plays
before
she
begins
to
sing
i
ca
bear
even
to
think
of
the
words
the
whole
of
it
is
full
of
horrible
things
it
smells
of
the
jail
it
looks
like
stripes
it
you
not
going
to
faint
asked
the
man
moving
closer
to
me
me
i
never
fainted
in
my
life
where
is
he
now
tom
dorgan
tom
dorgan
yes
i
was
sure
i
saw
him
sail
but
of
course
i
was
mistaken
he
has
sent
you
after
me
has
he
i
can
hardly
believe
it
of
tom
even
even
yet
i
do
know
anything
that
connects
you
with
dorgan
if
he
was
in
with
you
on
this
you
better
remember
before
you
say
anything
more
that
it
all
be
used
against
you
the
curtain
had
gone
down
and
gone
up
again
i
was
watching
the
star
she
has
such
a
boyish
way
of
nodding
her
head
instead
of
bowing
after
she
waddles
out
to
the
center
and
every
time
she
wipes
her
lips
with
her
lace
handkerchief
as
though
she
just
taken
one
of
the
cocktails
she
makes
in
the
play
with
all
the
skill
of
a
bartender
i
found
myself
doing
the
same
thing
wiping
my
lips
with
that
very
same
gesture
as
though
i
had
a
fat
bare
forearm
like
a
when
all
at
once
the
thought
came
to
me
you
need
bother
nancy
all
up
you
wo
have
any
use
for
it
all
just
what
is
the
charge
i
asked
turning
to
the
man
beside
me
stealing
a
purse
containing
three
hundred
dollars
from
paul
gates
house
on
the
night
of
april
what
it
was
obermuller
he
had
pushed
the
curtains
aside
the
crashing
of
the
orchestra
had
prevented
our
hearing
the
clatter
of
the
rings
he
had
pushed
by
the
man
standing
there
had
come
in
and
he
had
heard
nance
he
cried
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
he
turned
in
his
quick
way
to
the
men
what
are
your
orders
to
take
her
to
her
flat
and
search
it
obermuller
came
over
to
me
then
and
took
my
hand
for
a
minute
it
a
pity
they
do
know
about
the
gray
rose
diamond
he
whispered
helping
me
on
with
my
jacket
they
see
how
silly
this
little
dollar
business
is
brace
up
nance
olden
oh
mag
mag
to
hear
a
man
like
that
talk
to
you
as
though
you
were
his
kind
when
you
have
the
feel
of
the
coarse
prison
stripes
between
your
dry
shaking
fingers
and
the
close
prison
smell
is
already
poisoning
your
nostrils
i
do
see
my
voice
shook
how
you
can
believe
in
me
do
you
he
laughed
that
easy
you
got
brains
nance
and
the
most
imbecile
thing
you
could
do
just
now
when
your
foot
is
already
on
the
ladder
would
be
just
this
to
get
off
in
order
to
pick
up
a
trinket
out
of
the
mud
when
there
a
fortune
up
at
the
top
waiting
for
you
clever
people
do
do
asinine
things
and
other
clever
people
know
that
they
do
you
clever
but
so
am
i
in
my
weak
small
way
come
along
little
girl
he
pulled
my
hand
in
his
arm
and
we
walked
out
followed
by
the
two
men
oh
no
it
was
all
very
quiet
and
looked
just
like
a
little
theater
party
that
had
an
early
supper
engagement
obermuller
nodded
to
the
manager
out
in
the
deserted
lobby
who
stopped
us
and
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
the
star
you
think
me
mad
mag
those
fellows
with
the
badges
were
sure
i
was
but
obermuller
eyes
only
twinkled
and
the
manager
grin
grew
broad
when
catching
up
the
end
of
my
skirt
and
up
and
down
i
sang
under
my
breath
that
that
was
trailing
over
and
over
through
my
head
bravo
bravo
whispered
the
manager
hoarsely
clapping
his
hands
softly
i
gave
one
of
those
quick
funny
boyish
nods
the
star
inside
affects
and
wiped
my
lips
with
my
handkerchief
that
brought
down
my
house
even
the
biggest
fellow
with
the
badge
giggled
recognizingly
and
then
put
his
hand
quickly
in
front
of
his
mouth
and
tried
to
look
severe
and
official
the
color
had
come
back
to
obermuller
face
it
was
worth
dancing
for
that
be
patient
mag
let
me
tell
it
my
way
there
was
room
in
the
coupe
waiting
out
in
front
for
more
than
two
so
obermuller
could
come
in
it
but
he
put
me
in
mag
dear
dear
mag
he
put
me
in
as
if
i
was
a
lady
not
like
gray
a
real
one
a
thing
like
that
counts
when
two
detectives
are
watching
it
counted
afterward
in
the
way
they
treated
me
the
big
man
climbed
up
on
the
seat
with
the
driver
the
fellow
got
in
and
sat
beside
me
closing
the
door
i
be
out
there
almost
as
soon
as
you
are
obermuller
said
standing
a
moment
beside
the
lowered
window
you
good
fellow
i
said
and
then
trying
to
laugh
i
do
as
much
for
you
some
day
he
shook
his
fist
laughingly
at
me
and
i
waved
my
hand
as
we
drove
of
you
know
miss
there
may
be
some
mistake
about
this
said
the
man
next
to
me
and
yes
there
may
be
in
fact
there
is
i
sure
i
be
very
glad
if
it
is
a
mistake
they
do
happen
though
not
often
you
spoke
of
dorgan
did
i
yes
tom
dorgan
who
busted
out
of
sing
sing
the
other
day
surely
you
mistaken
i
said
smiling
right
into
his
blue
eyes
the
tom
dorgan
i
mentioned
is
a
performer
at
the
vaudeville
ever
see
him
n
no
clever
fellow
you
ought
to
perhaps
you
do
recognize
him
under
that
name
on
the
bills
he
professor
haughwout
stage
people
have
so
many
names
you
know
yes
so
have
some
other
people
i
laughed
and
he
grinned
back
at
me
now
that
mean
of
you
i
said
i
never
had
but
one
it
was
all
i
needed
it
flashed
through
me
then
what
a
thing
like
this
might
do
to
a
name
you
know
mag
every
bit
of
recognition
an
actress
steals
from
the
world
is
so
much
capital
it
is
like
the
old
graft
when
you
had
to
begin
new
every
time
you
took
up
a
piece
of
work
and
your
name
the
name
the
world
knows
and
its
knowing
it
makes
it
worth
having
like
everything
that
name
is
the
sum
of
every
scheme
you
planned
of
every
time
you
got
away
with
the
goods
of
every
laugh
lifted
of
every
bit
of
cleverness
you
thought
out
and
embodied
of
everything
that
in
you
of
everything
you
are
but
i
did
dare
think
long
of
this
i
turned
to
him
tell
me
about
this
charge
i
said
where
was
the
purse
whose
was
it
and
why
have
they
missed
it
till
after
a
week
they
missed
it
all
right
that
night
but
gates
wanted
it
kept
quiet
till
the
servants
had
been
shadowed
and
it
was
positively
proved
that
they
had
got
away
with
it
and
then
she
thought
of
me
and
then
she
thought
of
you
i
wonder
why
because
you
were
the
only
person
in
that
room
except
gates
the
lady
who
lost
the
purse
ramsay
and
eh
n
nothing
ramsay
you
said
yes
not
edward
ramsay
of
philadelphia
oh
you
know
the
name
oh
yes
i
know
it
it
was
printed
you
know
in
gold
lettering
on
the
inside
flap
and
i
do
know
well
it
was
and
it
contained
three
hundred
dollars
ramsay
says
she
had
slipped
it
under
the
fold
of
the
spread
at
the
top
of
the
bed
in
the
room
where
you
took
off
your
things
in
presence
and
put
them
on
again
when
no
one
else
was
there
and
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
this
is
all
i
raged
at
him
that
every
bit
of
evidence
you
have
to
warrant
your
treating
an
innocent
girl
like
you
did
behave
like
a
very
innocent
girl
if
you
remember
he
said
dryly
when
i
first
came
into
the
box
in
fact
if
that
fellow
had
just
come
in
then
i
believe
you
confessed
the
whole
job
too
late
he
added
i
did
answer
i
put
my
head
back
against
the
cushions
and
closed
my
eyes
i
could
feel
the
scrutiny
of
his
blue
eyes
on
my
naked
face
your
face
is
so
unprotected
with
the
eyes
closed
like
a
fort
whose
battery
is
withdrawn
but
i
was
tired
it
tires
you
when
you
care
a
year
ago
mag
this
sort
of
thing
the
risk
the
nearness
to
danger
the
chances
one
way
or
the
other
would
have
intoxicated
me
i
used
to
feel
as
though
i
was
dancing
on
a
volcano
and
daring
it
to
explode
the
more
twistings
and
turnings
there
were
to
the
labyrinth
the
greater
glory
it
was
to
get
out
maggie
darlin
you
have
before
you
a
mournful
spectacle
the
degeneration
of
nancy
olden
it
that
she
lost
courage
it
only
that
she
used
to
be
able
to
think
of
only
one
thing
and
now
what
do
you
suppose
it
is
mag
if
you
know
do
you
dare
to
tell
me
when
we
got
to
the
flat
obermuller
was
already
there
at
the
door
i
pulled
out
my
key
and
opened
it
with
a
flourish
wo
you
come
in
gentlemen
and
spend
the
evening
i
asked
they
followed
me
in
first
to
the
parlor
the
two
fellows
threw
off
their
coats
and
searched
that
through
and
through
not
a
drawer
did
they
miss
not
a
bit
of
furniture
did
they
fail
to
move
obermuller
and
i
sat
there
guying
them
as
they
pried
about
in
their
that
trust
business
has
taken
the
life
out
of
him
of
late
all
their
tricks
all
their
squeezings
their
cheatings
their
bossing
and
bragging
and
bullying
have
got
on
to
his
nerves
till
he
looks
like
a
chained
bear
getting
a
drubbing
and
he
swears
that
they
in
a
conspiracy
to
freeze
him
and
a
few
others
like
him
out
he
believes
there
actually
a
paper
in
existence
that
would
prove
it
but
this
affair
of
the
purse
seemed
to
excite
him
till
he
behaved
like
a
bad
and
i
well
nance
olden
was
never
far
behind
at
the
cruelty
when
there
was
anything
going
on
we
trailed
after
them
and
when
finished
with
the
bedrooms
yours
and
mine
i
asked
the
big
fellow
to
come
into
the
kitchen
with
and
me
while
the
detective
tackled
the
and
i
get
up
a
lunch
for
us
all
mag
you
should
have
seen
fred
obermuller
with
a
big
apron
on
him
dressing
the
salad
while
i
was
making
sandwiches
the
cruelty
taught
me
how
to
cook
even
if
it
did
teach
me
other
things
you
have
believed
that
the
trust
had
got
him
by
the
throat
and
was
choking
the
last
breath
out
of
him
you
would
have
believed
that
our
salaries
had
been
paid
for
three
weeks
that
our
houses
were
dwindling
every
night
that
i
was
thinking
about
it
all
there
in
the
back
of
my
head
trying
to
see
a
way
out
of
it
you
know
if
there
is
such
an
agreement
as
obermuller
swears
there
is
it
against
the
law
while
we
rattled
on
the
two
of
us
like
a
couple
of
children
on
a
picnic
when
i
heard
a
crash
behind
me
the
salad
bowl
had
slipped
from
obermuller
fingers
he
stood
with
his
back
turned
to
me
his
eyes
fixed
upon
that
searching
detective
but
he
was
searching
any
more
mag
he
was
standing
still
as
a
pointer
that
scented
game
he
had
moved
the
lounge
out
from
the
wall
and
there
on
the
floor
spread
open
where
it
had
fallen
lay
a
handsome
purse
with
gold
corners
from
where
i
stood
mag
i
could
read
the
plain
gold
lettering
on
the
dark
leather
i
did
have
to
move
it
was
plain
enough
quite
plain
edward
ramsay
hush
hush
mag
if
you
take
on
so
how
can
i
tell
you
the
rest
obermuller
got
in
front
of
me
as
i
started
to
walk
into
the
i
do
know
what
his
idea
was
i
do
suppose
he
does
exactly
if
it
was
to
spare
me
the
sight
of
that
damned
thing
oh
how
i
hated
it
that
purse
i
hated
it
as
if
it
had
been
something
alive
that
could
be
glad
of
what
it
had
done
i
wished
it
was
alive
that
i
could
tear
and
rend
it
and
stamp
on
it
and
throw
it
in
a
fire
and
drag
it
out
again
with
burned
and
bleeding
nails
to
tear
it
again
and
again
i
wanted
to
fall
on
it
and
hide
it
to
push
it
far
far
away
out
of
sight
to
stamp
it
down
down
into
the
very
bottom
of
the
earth
where
it
could
feel
the
hell
it
was
making
for
me
but
i
only
stood
there
stupidly
looking
at
it
having
pushed
past
obermuller
as
though
i
never
wanted
to
see
anything
else
and
then
i
heard
that
fellow
words
well
he
said
pulling
on
his
coat
as
though
he
done
a
good
work
i
guess
you
just
better
come
along
with
me
xi
do
you
think
you
better
get
out
of
this
i
asked
obermuller
as
he
came
into
the
station
a
few
minutes
after
i
got
there
no
i
do
because
because
it
wo
do
you
any
good
to
have
your
name
mixed
up
with
a
thing
like
this
but
it
might
do
you
some
good
i
did
answer
for
a
minute
after
that
i
sat
in
my
chair
my
eyes
bent
on
the
floor
i
counted
the
cracks
between
the
chair
and
the
floor
of
the
office
where
the
chief
was
busy
with
another
case
i
counted
them
six
times
back
and
forth
till
my
eyes
were
clear
and
my
voice
was
steady
you
awfully
good
i
said
looking
up
at
him
as
he
stood
by
me
you
the
best
fellow
i
ever
knew
i
did
know
men
could
be
so
good
to
women
but
you
better
go
please
it
be
bad
enough
when
the
papers
get
hold
of
this
without
having
them
lump
you
in
with
a
bad
lot
like
me
he
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
gave
it
a
quick
little
shake
do
say
that
about
yourself
you
not
a
bad
lot
but
you
saw
the
purse
yes
i
saw
it
but
it
has
proved
anything
to
me
but
this
innocent
nance
or
you
crazy
if
it
the
first
i
want
to
stand
by
you
little
girl
if
it
the
second
good
god
i
got
to
stand
by
you
harder
than
ever
can
you
see
me
sitting
there
mag
in
the
bright
bare
little
room
with
its
electric
lights
still
in
my
white
dress
and
big
white
hat
my
pretty
jacket
fallen
on
the
floor
beside
me
i
could
feel
the
sharp
blue
eyes
of
that
detective
morris
feeding
on
my
miserable
face
but
i
could
feel
too
a
warmth
like
wine
poured
into
me
from
that
big
fellow
voice
i
put
my
hand
up
to
him
and
he
took
it
if
i
innocent
and
can
prove
it
fred
obermuller
i
get
even
with
you
for
for
this
do
you
want
to
do
something
for
me
now
do
i
well
if
you
want
to
help
me
do
sit
there
looking
like
the
criminal
ghost
of
the
girl
i
know
the
blood
rushed
to
my
face
nance
olden
a
sniveling
coward
me
showing
the
white
feather
me
whimpering
like
a
whipped
puppy
me
nance
olden
you
know
i
smiled
up
at
him
i
never
did
enjoy
getting
caught
hush
but
that
better
tell
me
now
a
buzzer
sounded
the
detective
got
up
and
came
over
to
me
chief
ready
he
said
this
way
they
stopped
obermuller
at
the
door
but
he
pushed
past
them
i
want
to
say
just
a
word
to
you
chief
he
said
you
remember
me
i
obermuller
of
the
vaudeville
if
you
send
those
fellows
out
and
let
me
speak
to
you
just
a
moment
i
leave
you
alone
with
miss
olden
the
chief
nodded
to
the
detective
and
he
and
the
other
fellow
went
out
and
shut
the
door
behind
them
i
want
simply
to
call
your
attention
to
the
absurdity
and
unreasonableness
of
this
thing
obermuller
said
leaning
up
against
the
chief
desk
while
he
threw
out
his
left
hand
with
that
big
open
gesture
of
his
and
to
ask
you
to
bear
in
mind
no
matter
what
appearances
may
be
that
miss
olden
is
the
most
talented
girl
on
the
stage
that
in
a
very
short
time
she
will
be
at
the
top
that
just
now
she
is
not
suffering
for
lack
of
money
that
she
not
a
but
a
determined
little
grind
and
that
if
she
did
feel
like
taking
a
plunge
she
knows
that
she
could
get
all
she
wants
from
me
even
even
if
you
ca
pay
salaries
when
they
due
obermuller
the
chief
grinned
under
his
white
mustache
even
though
the
trust
is
pushing
me
to
the
wall
going
to
such
lengths
that
they
liable
criminally
as
well
as
civilly
if
i
could
only
get
my
hands
on
proof
of
their
rascality
it
true
i
ca
pay
salaries
always
when
they
due
but
i
can
still
raise
a
few
hundred
to
help
a
friend
and
miss
olden
is
a
friend
of
mine
if
you
can
prove
that
she
took
this
money
you
prove
only
that
she
gone
mad
but
you
do
all
right
obermuller
you
not
the
lawyer
for
the
defense
come
later
if
it
does
come
i
be
glad
to
bear
in
mind
all
said
and
much
that
you
have
thank
you
good
night
i
wait
for
you
nance
outside
i
going
to
ask
you
a
lot
of
questions
miss
olden
the
old
chief
said
when
we
were
alone
sit
here
please
morris
tells
me
got
more
nerve
than
any
woman
that
ever
come
before
me
so
i
bother
to
reassure
you
you
do
look
like
a
girl
that
easily
frightened
i
have
heard
how
you
danced
in
the
lobby
of
the
manhattan
how
you
guyed
him
at
your
flat
and
were
getting
lunch
and
having
a
regular
picnic
of
a
time
when
when
he
found
that
purse
exactly
now
why
did
you
do
all
that
why
because
i
felt
like
it
i
felt
gay
and
excited
and
not
dreaming
that
that
purse
was
sure
to
be
found
not
dreaming
that
there
was
such
a
purse
in
existence
except
from
the
detective
say
so
and
never
fancying
for
an
instant
that
it
would
be
found
in
my
flat
hm
he
looked
at
me
from
under
his
heavy
wrinkled
old
lids
you
do
get
nice
eyes
from
looking
on
the
nasty
things
in
this
world
mag
why
i
cried
what
kind
of
a
girl
could
cut
up
like
that
when
she
was
on
the
very
edge
of
discovery
a
very
smart
girl
an
actress
a
good
one
a
clever
thief
who
used
to
bluffing
of
course
he
added
softly
you
wo
misunderstand
me
i
simply
suggesting
the
different
kinds
of
girl
that
could
have
done
what
you
did
but
if
you
do
mind
i
do
the
questioning
nance
olden
he
turned
suddenly
on
me
his
manner
changed
and
threatening
what
has
become
of
that
three
hundred
dollars
chief
you
know
just
as
much
about
that
as
i
do
i
threw
up
my
head
and
looked
him
full
in
the
face
it
was
over
now
all
the
shivering
and
trembling
and
fearing
nance
olden
not
a
coward
when
she
fighting
for
her
freedom
and
fighting
alone
without
any
sympathizing
friend
to
weaken
her
he
returned
the
look
with
interest
i
may
know
more
he
said
insinuatingly
possibly
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
no
it
was
put
on
there
never
yet
was
a
man
who
bullied
me
that
did
rouse
the
fighter
in
me
i
swore
to
myself
that
this
old
should
rattle
me
does
it
occur
to
you
that
under
the
circumstances
a
full
confession
might
be
the
very
best
thing
for
you
i
should
wonder
if
these
people
would
be
inclined
to
be
lenient
with
you
if
you
return
the
money
does
it
occur
it
might
occur
to
me
if
i
had
anything
to
confess
about
this
purse
how
long
since
you
seen
edward
ramsay
he
rushed
the
question
at
me
i
jumped
how
do
you
know
i
ever
seen
her
i
do
know
you
have
i
do
believe
you
thank
you
neither
do
i
believe
you
which
is
more
to
the
point
come
answer
the
question
how
long
is
it
since
you
have
seen
the
lady
i
looked
at
him
and
then
i
looked
at
my
glove
and
slowly
pulled
the
fingers
inside
out
and
then
then
i
giggled
suddenly
it
came
to
me
that
silly
little
insane
dodge
of
mine
in
the
bishop
carriage
that
day
the
girl
who
had
lost
her
name
and
the
use
all
that
affair
might
be
to
me
if
ever
i
tell
you
if
you
let
me
think
a
minute
i
said
sweetly
it
it
must
be
all
of
fifteen
months
ah
you
see
i
did
know
that
you
met
the
lady
if
you
wise
you
draw
deductions
as
to
other
things
i
know
that
you
do
think
i
do
and
where
did
you
see
her
in
her
own
home
called
there
he
sneered
alone
no
i
said
very
gently
i
went
there
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
with
the
bishop
yes
it
was
the
bishop
bishop
van
wagenen
indeed
i
could
see
that
he
did
believe
a
word
i
was
saying
which
made
me
happily
eager
to
tell
him
more
yes
we
drove
up
to
the
square
one
afternoon
in
the
carriage
the
fat
one
you
know
we
had
tea
there
at
least
i
did
i
was
to
have
spent
the
night
but
that
enough
of
that
i
chuckled
yes
mag
monahan
i
was
enjoying
myself
i
was
having
a
run
for
my
money
even
if
it
was
the
last
run
i
was
to
have
so
it
fifteen
months
since
you
seen
ramsay
eh
yes
he
turned
on
me
with
a
roar
and
yet
it
only
a
week
since
you
saw
her
at
mrs
gates
oh
no
no
take
care
that
night
at
gates
it
was
dark
you
know
in
the
front
room
i
did
see
ramsay
that
night
i
did
know
she
was
there
at
all
till
till
till
later
i
was
told
who
told
you
her
husband
he
threw
down
his
pencil
look
here
this
is
no
lark
young
woman
and
you
need
trouble
yourself
to
weave
any
more
fairy
tales
ramsay
is
in
a
he
very
his
own
wife
has
seen
him
since
that
night
so
you
see
lying
uselessly
really
so
edward
did
go
back
to
gates
that
night
tut
tut
after
his
telephone
message
too
now
assuming
your
innocence
of
the
theft
miss
olden
what
is
your
theory
how
do
you
account
for
the
presence
of
that
purse
in
your
flat
now
you
hit
the
part
of
it
that
really
puzzles
me
how
do
you
account
for
it
what
is
your
theory
he
got
to
his
feet
pushing
his
chair
back
sharply
my
theory
if
you
want
to
know
it
is
that
you
stole
the
purse
that
your
friend
obermuller
believes
you
did
that
you
got
away
with
the
three
hundred
or
hid
it
away
and
and
what
a
stupid
thief
i
must
be
then
to
leave
the
empty
purse
under
my
lounge
how
do
you
know
it
was
empty
he
demanded
sharply
you
said
so
well
you
gave
me
to
understand
that
it
was
then
what
difference
does
it
make
it
would
be
a
still
stupider
thief
leave
a
full
purse
instead
of
an
empty
one
under
his
own
lounge
yes
and
you
not
stupid
miss
olden
thank
you
i
sorry
i
ca
say
as
much
for
you
i
could
help
it
he
was
such
a
stupid
the
idea
of
telling
me
that
fred
obermuller
believed
me
guilty
the
idea
of
thinking
me
such
a
fool
as
to
believe
that
such
men
as
that
make
criminals
they
so
you
positively
ache
they
so
tempt
you
to
pull
the
wool
over
their
eyes
o
mag
if
the
lord
had
only
made
men
cleverer
there
be
fewer
nancy
oldens
the
chief
blew
a
blast
at
his
that
made
his
purple
cheeks
seem
about
to
burst
my
shoulders
shook
as
i
watched
him
he
was
so
wrathy
and
i
was
still
laughing
when
i
followed
the
detective
out
into
the
where
obermuller
was
pacing
the
floor
at
the
sight
of
my
smiling
face
he
came
rushing
to
me
nance
he
cried
orders
are
morris
came
in
a
bellow
from
the
chief
at
his
door
that
no
further
communication
be
allowed
between
the
prisoner
and
phew
all
the
pertness
leaked
out
of
me
oh
mag
i
do
like
that
word
it
stings
it
binds
it
cuts
i
do
know
what
i
looked
like
then
i
was
thinking
of
me
i
was
watching
obermuller
face
it
seemed
to
grow
old
and
thin
and
haggard
before
my
eyes
as
the
blood
drained
out
of
it
he
turned
with
an
exclamation
to
the
chief
and
and
just
then
there
came
a
long
ring
at
the
telephone
why
did
i
stand
there
o
mag
when
you
on
your
way
to
the
place
i
was
bound
for
when
you
know
that
before
you
set
foot
in
this
same
bright
little
room
again
the
hounds
in
half
a
dozen
cities
will
have
scratched
clean
every
you
had
when
your
every
act
will
be
known
and
and
oh
then
you
wait
mag
you
wait
for
anything
anything
in
the
world
even
a
telephone
call
that
may
only
be
bringing
in
another
wretch
like
yourself
bound
like
yourself
for
the
tombs
the
chief
himself
went
to
answer
it
yes
what
he
growled
well
tell
long
distance
to
get
busy
what
that
francis
that
the
jag
ward
is
it
who
is
it
who
ramsay
i
caught
obermuller
hand
i
do
hear
you
the
chief
roared
oh
yes
yes
we
got
the
thief
but
the
money
no
we
have
got
the
money
the
deuce
you
say
took
it
yourself
out
of
your
wife
purse
yes
yes
but
got
the
what
do
remember
where
you
steady
nance
whispered
obermuller
grabbing
my
other
hand
i
tried
to
stand
steady
but
everything
swayed
and
i
could
hear
the
rest
of
what
the
chief
was
saying
though
all
my
life
seemed
condensed
into
a
listening
but
i
did
hear
when
he
jammed
the
receiver
on
the
hook
and
faced
us
well
they
got
the
money
ramsay
took
the
purse
himself
thinking
it
was
safe
there
under
the
spread
where
any
servant
might
be
tempted
who
chanced
to
uncover
it
you
admit
the
thing
looked
shady
the
reason
ramsay
did
know
of
it
is
because
the
old
man
just
come
to
his
senses
in
a
hospital
and
been
notified
that
the
purse
was
missing
i
want
to
apologize
to
you
chief
i
mumbled
for
thinking
me
stupid
oh
we
were
both
no
for
thinking
me
not
stupid
i
am
stupid
stupid
stupid
the
old
fellow
i
told
you
about
and
the
way
i
telephoned
him
out
of
the
flat
that
night
it
was
ramsay
i
nodded
and
then
crumbled
to
the
floor
it
was
then
that
they
sent
for
you
mag
why
did
i
tell
it
straight
at
the
first
you
dear
old
mag
because
i
did
know
the
straight
of
it
then
myself
i
was
so
i
never
once
thought
of
edward
he
must
have
taken
the
bills
out
of
the
purse
and
then
crammed
them
in
his
pocket
while
he
was
waiting
there
on
the
lounge
and
i
was
pretending
to
telephone
and
but
it
best
as
it
is
oh
so
best
think
mag
two
people
who
knew
her
who
knew
her
mind
believed
in
nancy
olden
in
spite
of
appearances
obermuller
while
we
were
in
the
thick
of
it
and
you
you
dear
girl
while
i
was
telling
you
of
it
xii
when
obermuller
sent
for
me
i
thought
he
wanted
to
see
me
about
that
play
he
writing
in
which
i
to
star
when
the
pigs
begin
to
fly
funniest
thing
in
the
world
about
that
man
mag
he
knows
he
ca
get
bookings
for
any
play
on
earth
that
if
he
did
they
be
canceled
and
any
old
excuse
thrown
at
him
as
soon
as
tausig
heard
of
it
and
could
put
on
the
screws
he
knows
that
there
is
an
unwatched
hole
in
theatrical
america
through
which
he
can
crawl
and
pull
me
and
the
play
in
after
him
and
yet
he
just
ca
let
go
working
on
it
he
loves
it
mag
he
loves
it
as
molly
loved
that
child
of
hers
that
kept
her
nursing
it
all
the
years
of
its
life
and
left
her
feeling
that
the
world
had
been
robbed
of
everything
there
was
for
a
woman
to
do
when
it
died
obermuller
has
told
me
all
the
plot
in
fact
he
worked
it
out
on
me
i
know
it
as
it
is
as
he
wanted
it
to
be
and
as
it
going
to
be
he
tells
me
he
built
it
up
about
me
that
it
will
fit
me
as
never
a
comedy
fitted
a
player
yet
and
that
we
make
such
a
hit
the
play
and
i
together
that
and
then
he
remembers
that
there
no
chance
not
the
ghost
of
one
and
he
falls
to
swearing
at
the
trust
do
you
think
i
said
as
he
began
again
when
i
came
into
his
office
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
quit
cursing
the
syndicate
till
you
got
something
new
to
say
or
something
different
to
rail
about
it
seems
to
me
a
man
likely
to
get
daffy
if
he
keeps
harping
on
oh
i
got
it
all
right
nance
be
sure
of
that
i
got
something
different
to
say
of
them
and
something
new
to
swear
about
done
me
up
that
all
just
as
they
fixed
iringer
and
gaffney
and
howison
tell
me
he
threw
out
his
arms
and
then
let
them
fall
to
his
side
oh
it
easy
he
cried
so
easy
that
i
never
thought
of
it
they
just
bought
the
vaudeville
out
of
hand
and
served
notice
on
me
that
when
my
lease
expires
next
month
they
not
be
able
to
renew
it
that
all
no
not
quite
in
order
to
kill
all
hope
of
a
new
plan
in
me
they
just
let
it
get
to
be
understood
that
any
man
or
woman
that
works
for
obermuller
need
come
round
to
them
at
any
future
time
phew
a
blacklist
not
anything
so
tangible
it
just
a
hint
you
know
but
it
works
all
right
it
works
like
what
are
you
going
to
do
what
can
you
do
shoot
tausig
or
myself
or
both
of
us
nonsense
yes
of
course
it
nonsense
or
rather
it
only
what
i
like
to
do
but
that
not
the
question
never
mind
about
me
it
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
looked
straight
at
me
waiting
but
i
did
answer
i
was
thinking
you
do
realize
nance
what
those
fellows
are
capable
of
when
gaffney
told
me
before
he
gave
up
and
went
west
that
there
was
a
genuine
signed
conspiracy
among
them
to
crush
out
us
independents
i
laughed
at
him
a
dream
gaffney
i
said
it
no
dream
as
you
find
out
when
your
turn
comes
in
time
he
shouted
a
fact
and
what
more
iringer
once
taxed
tausig
to
his
face
with
it
told
him
he
knew
there
was
such
a
document
in
existence
signed
by
the
great
tausig
himself
by
heffelfinger
of
the
pacific
circuit
by
dixon
of
chicago
and
weinstock
of
new
orleans
binding
themselves
to
force
us
fellows
to
the
wall
and
specifying
the
per
cent
of
profit
each
one
of
should
get
on
any
increase
of
business
to
blacklist
every
man
and
woman
that
worked
for
us
to
buy
up
our
debts
and
even
bring
false
attachments
when
now
were
there
enough
real
debts
to
satisfy
they
hard
to
please
if
you
have
creditors
enough
to
suit
he
looked
grim
but
he
did
speak
i
do
believe
it
anyway
o
and
is
good
for
you
to
keep
thinking
about
just
one
thing
you
land
where
iringer
did
if
you
do
look
out
how
did
he
know
about
it
anyway
there
was
a
leak
in
tausig
office
iringer
used
to
be
in
with
them
and
he
had
it
from
a
clerk
who
but
never
mind
that
it
the
blacklisting
i
talking
about
now
gray
just
been
in
to
see
me
to
let
me
know
that
she
quits
at
the
end
of
the
season
and
his
lordship
too
of
course
you
not
burdened
with
a
contract
nance
perhaps
you
better
think
it
over
seriously
for
a
day
or
two
and
decide
if
it
would
be
best
i
do
have
to
i
interrupted
then
nance
he
cried
jumping
up
as
though
he
been
relieved
of
half
his
troubles
i
do
have
to
think
it
over
i
went
on
slowly
not
looking
at
the
hand
he
held
out
to
me
it
does
take
long
to
know
that
when
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
sea
you
better
try
the
devil
rather
than
be
forced
out
into
the
wet
what
you
do
mean
i
knew
he
was
looking
at
me
incredulously
but
i
just
would
meet
his
eye
my
staying
with
you
will
do
you
no
good
was
hurrying
now
to
get
it
over
with
and
it
would
do
me
a
lot
of
harm
i
think
you
right
obermuller
i
better
just
go
over
to
where
it
warm
they
be
glad
to
get
me
and
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
be
glad
to
get
in
with
the
syndicate
even
if
i
ca
make
as
good
terms
as
i
might
have
by
selling
that
contract
which
like
the
famous
conspiracy
you
half
mad
about
never
existed
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
desk
i
caught
one
glimpse
of
his
face
it
was
black
that
was
enough
for
me
i
turned
to
go
ah
but
it
did
miss
olden
it
did
he
sneered
i
wo
believe
it
on
the
word
of
a
man
that
been
in
the
lunatic
asylum
ever
since
he
lost
his
theater
perhaps
you
believe
it
on
mine
i
jumped
on
yours
did
that
little
bully
when
he
lost
his
temper
that
day
at
the
van
twiller
when
we
had
our
last
fight
did
he
pull
a
paper
out
of
his
box
and
shake
it
in
my
face
and
but
you
could
have
them
arrested
for
conspiracy
and
and
the
proof
of
it
could
be
destroyed
and
then
but
i
ca
see
how
this
interests
you
no
no
i
said
thoughtfully
i
only
happened
to
lump
it
in
with
the
contract
we
have
you
and
i
and
as
there
no
contract
why
there
no
need
of
my
waiting
till
the
end
of
the
season
do
you
mean
to
say
you
you
if
done
better
it
be
done
quickly
i
said
macbethically
he
looked
at
me
sitting
there
on
his
desk
his
clenched
fist
on
his
knee
he
looked
for
a
moment
as
though
he
was
about
to
fly
at
me
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
slipped
into
his
chair
leaned
back
and
laughed
it
was
a
pleasant
laugh
mag
no
wait
let
me
tell
you
the
rest
you
are
so
shrewd
olden
so
awfully
shrewd
your
eye
is
so
everlastingly
out
for
the
main
chance
and
you
still
so
young
that
i
predict
a
a
great
future
for
you
i
might
even
suggest
that
by
cultivating
tausig
personally
you
need
no
you
right
i
need
you
can
discount
any
suggestion
i
might
make
you
just
want
to
be
the
first
to
go
over
eh
to
get
there
before
gray
does
to
get
all
there
is
in
it
for
the
first
rebel
that
lays
down
his
arms
not
to
come
in
late
when
submission
is
stale
and
cheap
do
worry
about
terms
you
poor
little
babe
in
the
woods
do
his
own
words
seemed
to
choke
him
do
you
think
i
began
a
bit
unsteadily
i
think
oh
what
a
fool
i
been
that
stiffened
me
of
course
you
have
i
said
cordially
it
silly
to
fight
the
push
is
it
it
only
the
cranks
that
get
cocky
and
think
they
can
upset
the
fellows
on
top
the
thing
to
do
is
to
find
out
which
is
the
stronger
if
you
a
better
man
than
the
other
fellow
down
him
if
he
the
champion
enlist
under
him
but
be
in
it
what
the
use
of
being
a
kicker
all
your
life
you
only
let
some
one
else
come
in
for
the
soft
things
while
you
stay
outside
and
gnaw
your
and
plot
and
plan
and
starve
you
spend
your
life
hoping
to
live
while
the
tausigs
are
living
high
the
thing
to
do
is
to
be
humble
if
you
ca
be
arrogant
if
they
got
you
in
the
door
curse
but
placate
them
think
of
gaffney
herding
sheep
out
in
nevada
of
iringer
in
the
asylum
of
howison
admirable
admirable
he
interrupted
sarcastically
the
only
fault
i
have
to
find
with
your
harangue
is
that
you
misconceived
my
meaning
entirely
but
i
need
enlighten
you
good
morning
miss
olden
he
turned
to
his
desk
and
pulled
out
some
papers
i
knew
he
was
so
desperately
absorbed
in
them
as
he
pretended
to
be
wo
you
shake
hands
i
asked
and
wish
me
luck
he
put
down
his
pen
his
face
was
white
and
hard
but
as
he
looked
at
me
it
gradually
softened
i
suppose
i
suppose
i
am
a
bit
unreasonable
just
this
minute
he
said
slowly
i
hard
hit
and
and
i
do
just
know
the
way
out
still
i
have
any
right
to
to
expect
more
of
you
than
there
is
in
you
you
poor
little
thing
it
not
your
fault
but
mine
that
expected
oh
for
god
sake
nance
go
and
leave
me
alone
i
had
to
take
that
with
me
to
the
van
twiller
and
it
was
pleasant
but
tausig
received
me
with
open
arms
got
tired
of
staying
out
in
the
cold
eh
he
grinned
i
tired
of
vaudeville
i
answered
ca
you
give
me
a
chance
in
a
comedy
hm
ambitious
ai
you
obermuller
has
a
play
all
ready
for
me
written
for
me
he
star
me
fast
enough
if
he
had
the
chance
but
he
never
get
the
chance
oh
i
do
know
but
i
do
he
on
the
toboggan
that
where
they
all
get
my
dear
when
they
get
enough
to
fight
us
but
obermuller
not
like
the
others
he
not
so
easy
and
he
is
so
clever
why
the
plot
of
that
comedy
is
the
bulliest
thing
you
read
it
you
remember
it
oh
i
know
it
by
heart
my
part
of
it
you
see
he
would
keep
away
from
me
while
he
was
thinking
of
it
he
kept
consulting
me
about
everything
in
it
in
a
way
we
worked
over
it
together
the
little
man
looked
at
me
slowly
closing
one
eye
it
is
a
habit
of
his
when
he
going
to
do
something
particularly
nasty
then
in
a
way
as
you
say
it
is
part
yours
hardly
imagine
nance
olden
writing
a
line
of
a
play
still
you
collaborated
that
the
word
i
say
my
dear
if
i
could
read
that
comedy
and
it
was
half
what
you
say
it
is
i
might
i
promise
mind
but
i
might
let
you
have
the
part
that
was
written
for
you
and
put
the
thing
on
has
he
drilled
you
any
eh
he
was
the
best
we
ever
had
before
he
got
the
notion
of
managing
for
himself
and
ruining
himself
well
he
all
that
yet
of
course
he
has
told
me
and
we
agreed
how
the
thing
should
be
done
as
he
write
you
know
he
read
the
thing
over
to
me
and
i
fine
fine
a
reading
from
that
fool
obermuller
would
be
enough
to
open
the
eyes
of
a
clever
woman
i
like
to
read
that
comedy
yes
but
obermuller
would
never
but
olden
might
what
dictate
the
plot
to
my
secretary
mason
in
there
he
nodded
his
head
back
toward
the
inner
room
she
could
give
him
the
plot
and
as
much
of
her
own
part
in
full
as
she
could
remember
you
know
mason
used
to
be
a
newspaper
man
smart
fellow
that
when
he
sober
he
could
piece
out
the
holes
yes
i
looked
at
him
the
little
beast
sat
there
slowly
closing
one
eye
and
opening
it
again
he
looked
like
an
unhealthy
little
frog
with
his
bald
head
his
mouth
that
laughed
while
the
wrinkles
rayed
away
from
his
cold
sneering
eyes
that
had
no
smile
in
them
i
i
would
like
to
make
an
enemy
of
a
man
like
obermuller
mr
tausig
bah
ai
i
told
you
he
on
the
toboggan
but
you
never
can
tell
with
a
man
like
that
suppose
he
got
into
that
combine
with
heffelfinger
and
dixon
and
weinstock
what
you
talking
about
well
it
what
i
heard
but
heffelfinger
and
dixon
and
weinstock
are
all
in
with
us
who
told
you
that
fairy
story
obermuller
himself
the
little
fellow
laughed
his
is
a
creaky
almost
silent
little
laugh
if
a
spider
could
laugh
he
laugh
that
way
they
fooling
him
a
bunch
or
two
never
you
mind
obermuller
he
a
dead
one
oh
he
said
that
you
thought
they
were
in
with
you
but
that
nothing
but
a
written
agreement
would
hold
men
like
that
and
that
you
got
smart
fellow
that
obermuller
he
have
been
a
good
man
to
have
in
the
business
if
it
had
been
for
those
independent
ideas
he
got
he
right
it
takes
so
there
is
an
agreement
i
shouted
in
spite
of
myself
as
i
leaned
forward
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
or
rather
he
let
it
swallow
him
again
what
business
is
that
of
yours
stick
to
the
business
on
hand
get
to
work
on
that
play
with
mason
inside
if
it
good
and
we
decide
to
put
it
on
we
pay
you
five
hundred
dollars
down
in
addition
to
your
salary
if
it
rot
you
have
your
salary
weekly
all
the
time
you
at
it
just
the
same
as
if
you
were
working
till
i
can
place
you
in
the
meantime
keep
your
ears
and
eyes
open
and
watch
things
and
your
mouth
shut
i
speak
to
mason
and
he
be
ready
for
you
morning
come
round
in
the
morning
there
nobody
about
then
and
we
want
to
keep
this
thing
dark
till
it
done
obermuller
must
get
any
idea
what
we
up
to
he
do
love
you
no
for
shaking
him
he
furious
would
even
say
i
done
for
with
him
anyway
i
guess
but
what
could
i
do
nothing
my
dear
nothing
you
a
smart
little
girl
he
chuckled
xiii
just
what
i
been
hoping
for
i
do
know
but
i
knew
that
my
chance
had
come
that
morning
for
a
week
i
had
been
talking
obermuller
comedy
to
mason
the
secretary
in
the
evenings
i
stood
about
in
the
wings
and
watched
the
van
twiller
company
in
brambles
there
was
one
fat
role
in
it
that
i
just
ached
for
but
i
lost
all
that
ache
and
found
another
when
i
overheard
two
of
the
women
talking
about
obermuller
and
me
one
night
he
found
her
and
made
her
one
of
said
just
dug
her
out
of
the
ground
see
what
he
done
for
her
taught
her
every
blessed
thing
she
knows
wrote
her
mimicking
monologues
for
her
gave
her
her
chance
and
and
now
well
tausig
do
pay
salaries
for
nothing
and
she
gets
hers
as
regularly
as
i
draw
mine
what
more
i
do
know
but
she
has
set
foot
on
the
stage
yet
under
tausig
and
they
say
obermuller
i
did
get
the
rest
of
it
so
i
do
know
what
they
say
about
obermuller
i
only
know
what
they
said
to
him
about
me
hard
to
make
men
believe
those
things
but
i
had
to
stand
it
what
could
i
do
i
could
tell
fred
obermuller
that
i
was
making
over
his
play
soul
and
as
much
body
as
i
could
remember
to
tausig
secretary
he
have
found
that
harder
to
believe
than
the
other
thing
it
has
been
a
very
happy
week
for
me
i
can
tell
you
maggie
but
i
forgot
it
all
every
shiver
and
ache
of
it
when
i
came
into
the
office
that
morning
as
usual
and
found
mason
alone
not
altogether
alone
he
had
his
bottle
and
he
had
had
it
and
others
of
the
same
family
all
the
night
before
the
poor
drunken
wretch
had
been
home
at
all
he
was
worse
than
he
been
that
morning
three
days
before
when
i
had
stood
facing
him
and
talking
to
him
while
with
my
hands
behind
my
back
i
was
taking
a
wax
impression
of
the
lock
of
the
desk
and
he
as
unconscious
of
it
all
as
tausig
himself
the
last
page
i
had
dictated
the
day
before
which
he
been
transcribing
from
his
notes
lay
in
front
of
him
the
gas
was
still
burning
directly
above
him
and
a
shade
he
wore
over
his
weak
eyes
had
been
knocked
awry
as
his
poor
old
bald
head
went
bumping
down
on
the
before
him
the
thing
that
favored
me
was
tausig
distrust
of
everybody
connected
with
him
he
hates
his
partners
only
a
bit
less
than
he
hates
the
men
outside
the
trust
the
bigger
and
richer
the
syndicate
grows
the
more
power
and
prosperity
it
has
the
more
he
begrudges
them
their
share
of
it
the
more
he
wants
it
all
for
himself
he
is
madly
suspicious
of
his
clerks
and
hires
others
to
watch
them
to
spy
upon
them
he
is
continually
moving
his
valuables
from
place
to
place
partly
because
he
trusts
no
man
partly
because
he
so
deathly
afraid
his
right
hand
will
find
out
what
his
left
is
doing
he
is
a
full
partner
of
braun
and
lowenthal
with
mental
reservations
he
has
no
confidence
in
either
of
them
half
his
schemes
he
keeps
from
them
the
other
half
he
tells
them
part
of
he
for
ever
afraid
that
the
syndicate
of
which
he
the
head
will
fall
to
pieces
and
become
another
syndicate
of
which
he
wo
be
head
it
all
makes
him
an
unhappy
restless
little
beast
but
it
helped
me
if
it
been
any
question
of
safe
combinations
and
tangled
things
like
that
the
game
would
have
been
all
up
for
nancy
o
but
in
his
official
safe
tausig
keeps
only
such
papers
as
he
wants
braun
and
lowenthal
to
see
and
in
his
private
desk
in
his
private
office
he
keeps
i
stole
past
mason
sleeping
with
his
forehead
on
the
keys
he
be
lettered
like
the
obelisk
when
he
wakes
up
and
crept
into
the
next
room
to
see
just
what
tausig
keeps
in
that
private
desk
of
his
oh
yes
it
was
locked
but
had
i
been
carrying
the
key
to
it
every
minute
for
the
last
hours
there
must
be
a
mine
of
stuff
in
that
desk
of
tausig
mag
the
touch
of
every
paper
in
it
is
slimy
with
some
dirty
trick
some
bad
secret
some
mean
action
it
a
pity
that
i
had
time
to
go
through
all
it
would
have
been
interesting
but
under
a
bundle
of
women
letters
which
that
old
fox
keeps
for
no
good
reason
i
bet
i
lit
on
a
paper
that
made
my
heart
go
bumping
like
a
cart
over
cobbles
yes
there
it
was
just
as
obermuller
had
vowed
it
was
with
cramped
little
signature
followed
by
heffelfinger
dixon
and
weinstock
a
scheme
to
crush
the
business
life
out
of
men
by
the
cleverest
trust
deviltry
a
thing
that
our
uncle
sammy
just
wo
stand
for
and
neither
will
nancy
olden
miss
monahan
she
grabbed
that
precious
paper
with
a
gasp
of
delight
and
closed
the
desk
but
she
bungled
a
bit
there
for
mason
lifted
his
head
and
blinked
dazedly
at
her
for
a
moment
recognized
her
and
shook
his
head
no
work
he
said
no
i
know
i
just
look
over
what
we
done
mason
she
answered
cheerfully
his
poor
head
went
down
again
with
a
bob
and
she
caught
up
the
sheets
of
obermuller
play
she
waited
a
minute
longer
half
because
she
wanted
to
make
sure
mason
was
asleep
again
before
she
tore
the
sheets
across
and
crammed
them
down
into
the
half
because
she
pitied
the
old
fellow
and
was
sorry
to
take
advantage
of
his
condition
but
she
knew
a
cure
for
this
last
sorry
a
way
help
him
later
and
when
she
danced
out
into
the
hall
she
was
the
very
happiest
burglar
in
a
world
chock
full
of
opportunities
oh
she
was
in
such
a
twitter
as
she
did
it
all
that
old
delight
in
doing
somebody
else
up
a
vague
somebody
whose
meannesses
she
know
was
as
nothing
to
the
joy
of
doing
tausig
up
she
was
dancing
on
a
volcano
again
that
incorrigible
nance
oh
but
such
a
volcano
maggie
it
atoned
for
a
year
of
days
when
there
was
nothing
doing
no
excitement
no
risk
nothing
to
keep
a
girl
interested
and
alive
and
maggie
darlin
it
was
a
wonderful
volcano
that
ones
that
last
one
for
it
worked
both
ways
it
paid
up
for
what
i
have
done
this
past
year
and
what
i
never
do
again
in
the
years
to
come
it
made
up
to
me
for
all
i
missed
and
all
i
going
to
miss
it
was
a
reward
of
demerit
for
not
being
respectable
and
a
preventive
of
further
sins
oh
it
was
such
a
volcano
as
never
was
it
was
a
drink
and
a
blue
ribbon
in
one
it
was
a
end
and
a
bully
beginning
it
was
it
was
tausig
coming
in
as
i
was
going
out
suddenly
i
realized
that
but
i
was
in
such
a
mad
whirl
of
excitement
that
i
almost
ran
over
the
little
fellow
before
i
could
stop
myself
phew
what
a
whirlwind
you
are
he
cried
where
are
you
going
oh
good
morning
tausig
i
said
sweetly
i
never
dreamed
be
down
so
early
in
the
morning
what
you
doing
with
the
paper
he
demanded
suspiciously
my
eye
followed
his
i
could
have
beaten
nancy
olden
in
that
minute
for
not
having
sense
enough
to
hide
that
precious
agreement
instead
of
carrying
it
rolled
up
in
her
hand
just
taking
it
home
to
go
over
it
i
said
carelessly
trying
to
pass
him
but
he
barred
my
way
where

he
pursed
up
his
thin
little
lips
and
shook
his
head
but
i
slipped
past
him
in
that
minute
and
got
out
into
the
street
at
i
called
back
as
i
hurried
off
i
got
around
the
corner
in
a
jiffy
oh
i
could
hardly
walk
mag
i
wanted
to
fly
and
dance
and
skip
i
wanted
to
kick
up
my
heels
as
the
children
were
doing
in
the
square
while
the
organ
ground
out
ai
it
a
shame
i
actually
did
a
step
or
two
with
them
to
their
delight
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
i
felt
a
bit
of
a
hand
in
mine
like
a
cool
pink
snowflake
and
oh
a
baby
mag
a
more
than
a
year
old
and
less
than
two
years
young
too
little
to
talk
too
big
not
to
walk
facing
the
world
with
a
winning
smile
and
jabbering
things
in
her
soft
little
lingo
knowing
that
every
woman
she
meets
will
understand
i
did
all
right
she
was
saying
to
me
as
she
kicked
out
her
soft
heelless
little
boot
nancy
olden
i
choose
you
nancy
olden
i
love
you
nancy
olden
i
dare
you
not
to
love
me
nancy
olden
i
defy
you
not
to
laugh
back
at
me
where
in
the
world
she
dropped
from
heaven
knows
the
picked
up
the
shafts
of
his
wagon
and
trundled
it
away
the
piccaninnies
melted
like
magic
but
that
gay
little
flirt
about
a
year
and
a
half
old
just
held
on
to
my
finger
and
gabbled
poetry
i
did
realize
just
then
that
she
was
a
lost
strayed
or
stolen
i
expected
every
moment
some
nurse
or
conceited
mamma
to
appear
and
drag
her
away
from
me
and
i
looked
down
at
her
oh
she
was
just
a
little
bunch
of
soft
stuff
her
face
was
a
giggling
dimple
framed
in
a
big
round
that
had
fallen
from
her
head
and
her
white
dress
with
the
blue
ribbons
at
the
shoulders
was
just
a
little
bit
dirty
i
like
a
little
bit
dirty
why
perhaps
because
i
can
imagine
having
a
little
coquette
of
my
own
a
bit
dirty
like
that
and
ca
just
see
nance
olden
with
a
clean
baby
all
feathers
and
lace
like
a
bored
little
you
a
mouse
i
gurgled
down
at
her
you
a
sweetheart
a
and
suddenly
i
heard
a
cry
and
rush
behind
me
it
was
a
false
alarm
just
a
girl
of
twelve
rushing
round
the
corner
followed
by
a
lot
of
others
it
had
been
meant
for
me
of
course
but
in
the
second
when
i
had
remembered
that
precious
paper
and
tausig
rage
when
he
should
miss
it
i
had
pulled
my
hand
away
from
that
bit
baby
and
started
to
run
the
poor
little
tot
there
is
any
reason
in
the
world
for
the
fancies
they
take
any
more
than
for
our
own
eh
mag
why
should
she
have
been
attracted
to
me
just
because
i
was
so
undignified
as
to
dance
with
the
piccaninnies
but
do
you
know
what
that
little
thing
did
she
thought
i
was
playing
with
her
she
gave
a
crow
of
delight
and
came
bowling
after
me
that
finished
me
i
stooped
and
picked
her
up
in
my
arms
throwing
her
up
in
the
air
to
hear
her
crow
and
feel
her
come
down
again
mouse
i
said
we
just
have
a
little
trip
together
the
nurse
that
lose
you
deserves
to
worry
till
you
found
the
mother
lucky
enough
to
own
you
will
be
benefited
hereafter
by
a
sharp
scare
on
your
account
just
now
come
on
sweetheart
oh
the
feel
of
a
baby
in
your
arms
mag
it
makes
the
cruelty
seem
a
perfectly
unreal
thing
a
thing
one
should
be
unutterably
ashamed
of
imagining
of
accusing
human
nature
of
a
thing
only
an
irredeemably
vile
thing
could
imagine
just
the
weight
of
that
little
body
riding
like
a
bonny
boat
at
anchor
on
your
arm
just
the
cocky
little
way
it
sits
up
chirping
and
confident
just
the
light
touch
of
a
bit
of
a
hand
on
your
collar
just
that
is
enough
to
push
down
brick
walls
to
destroy
pictures
of
bruised
and
maimed
children
that
endure
after
the
injuries
are
healed
to
scatter
records
that
even
i
i
nancy
olden
ca
believe
and
believe
too
that
other
women
have
carried
their
babies
as
i
did
some
other
woman
baby
across
the
square
on
the
other
side
i
set
her
down
i
did
want
to
i
was
greedy
of
every
moment
that
i
had
her
but
i
wanted
to
get
some
change
ready
before
climbing
up
the
steps
to
the
she
clutched
my
dress
as
we
stood
there
a
minute
in
a
perfectly
irresistible
way
i
know
now
why
men
marry
it
to
feel
that
delicious
helpless
clutch
of
weak
fingers
the
clutch
of
dependence
of
trust
of
appeal
i
looked
down
at
her
with
that
same
silly
adoration
i
seen
on
molly
face
for
her
poor
lacking
twisted
boy
at
least
i
did
in
the
beginning
but
gradually
the
expression
of
my
face
must
have
changed
for
all
at
once
i
discovered
what
had
been
done
to
me
my
purse
was
gone
yes
maggie
monahan
clean
gone
my
pocket
had
been
as
neatly
picked
as
i
myself
well
never
mind
as
what
i
threw
back
my
head
and
laughed
aloud
nance
olden
the
great
had
been
done
up
so
cleverly
so
surely
so
prettily
that
she
had
had
an
inkling
of
it
i
wished
i
could
get
a
glimpse
of
the
clever
girl
that
did
it
a
girl
of
course
it
was
do
you
think
any
boy
fingers
could
do
a
job
like
that
and
me
not
even
know
but
i
did
stop
to
wish
very
long
here
was
i
with
the
thing
i
valued
most
in
the
world
still
clutched
in
my
hand
and
not
a
nickel
to
my
name
to
get
me
the
paper
and
the
baby
on
our
way
it
was
the
baby
of
course
that
decided
me
you
ca
be
very
enterprising
when
you
carrying
a
pink
lump
of
sweetness
that
all
at
the
moment
but
may
get
all
the
next
it
you
for
the
nearest
police
station
you
young
tough
i
said
squeezing
her
i
ca
take
you
home
now
and
show
you
to
mag
but
she
giggled
and
gurgled
back
at
me
the
abandoned
thing
as
though
the
police
station
was
just
the
properest
place
for
a
young
lady
of
her
years
it
was
not
so
very
near
either
that
station
my
arm
ached
when
i
got
there
from
carrying
her
but
my
heart
ached
too
to
leave
her
i
told
the
matron
how
and
where
the
little
thing
had
picked
me
up
at
first
she
would
leave
me
but
the
fickle
little
thing
a
glass
of
milk
transferred
all
her
smiles
and
wiles
to
the
matron
then
we
both
went
over
her
clothes
to
find
a
name
or
an
initial
or
a
laundry
mark
but
we
found
nothing
the
matron
offered
me
a
glass
of
milk
too
but
i
was
in
a
hurry
to
be
gone
she
was
a
nice
matron
so
nice
that
i
was
just
about
to
ask
her
for
the
loan
of
when
when
i
heard
a
voice
maggie
in
the
office
adjoining
i
knew
that
voice
all
right
and
i
knew
that
i
had
to
make
a
decision
quick
i
did
i
threw
the
whole
thing
into
the
lap
of
fate
and
when
i
opened
the
door
and
faced
him
i
was
smiling
oh
yes
it
was
tausig
xiv
he
started
as
though
he
could
believe
his
eyes
when
he
saw
me
the
lord
hath
delivered
mine
enemy
into
my
hand
shone
in
his
evil
little
face
why
tausig
i
cried
before
he
could
get
his
breath
how
odd
to
meet
you
here
did
you
find
a
baby
too
did
i
find
he
glared
at
me
i
find
you
that
enough
now
but
the
luncheon
was
to
be
at
i
laughed
and
i
have
changed
my
dress
yet
you
change
it
all
right
for
something
not
so
becoming
if
you
shell
out
that
paper
paper
yes
paper
look
here
if
you
give
it
back
to
me
this
minute
now
i
not
prosecute
you
for
for
for
the
sake
of
my
reputation
i
suggested
softly
yes
he
looked
doubtfully
at
me
mistrusting
the
amiable
deference
of
my
manner
that
would
be
awfully
good
of
you
i
murmured
he
did
not
answer
but
watched
me
as
though
he
was
sure
which
way
i
jump
the
next
moment
i
wonder
what
could
induce
you
to
be
so
forgiving
i
went
on
musingly
what
sort
of
paper
is
this
you
miss
it
must
be
valuable
yes
it
valuable
all
right
come
on
now
quit
your
fooling
and
get
down
to
business
i
going
to
have
that
paper
do
you
know
tausig
i
said
impulsively
if
i
were
you
and
anybody
had
stolen
a
valuable
paper
from
me
i
have
him
arrested
i
would
i
should
not
care
a
rap
what
the
public
exposure
did
to
his
reputation
so
long
so
long
i
grinned
right
up
at
him
so
long
as
it
did
hurt
me
myself
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
mad
oh
he
was
hopping
a
german
burst
from
him
i
know
what
it
meant
but
i
can
imagine
look
here
i
give
you
one
more
chance
he
squeaked
if
you
do
what
you
do
i
was
sure
i
had
him
i
was
sure
from
the
very
whisper
in
which
he
had
spoken
that
the
last
thing
in
the
world
he
wanted
was
to
have
that
agreement
made
public
by
my
arrest
but
i
tripped
up
on
one
thing
i
did
know
there
was
a
middle
way
for
a
man
with
money
his
manner
changed
nance
olden
he
said
aloud
now
i
charge
you
with
stealing
a
valuable
private
paper
of
mine
from
my
desk
here
sergeant
i
had
particularly
noticed
the
sergeant
standing
at
the
other
door
with
his
back
to
us
but
from
the
way
he
came
at
tausig
call
i
knew
he
had
a
private
talk
with
him
and
i
knew
he
found
the
middle
way
this
girl
taken
a
paper
of
mine
i
want
her
searched
tausig
cried
do
you
mean
i
said
that
you
sign
your
name
to
such
a
charge
against
me
he
did
answer
he
had
pulled
the
sergeant
down
and
was
whispering
in
his
ear
i
knew
what
that
meant
it
meant
a
special
pull
and
a
special
way
of
doing
things
and
you
do
well
my
girl
to
give
up
tausig
property
to
him
the
sergeant
said
stiffly
but
what
have
i
got
that
belongs
to
him
i
demanded
he
grinned
and
shrugged
his
big
shoulders
we
a
way
of
finding
out
you
know
here
give
it
up
or
but
what
does
he
say
i
taken
what
charge
is
there
against
me
have
you
the
right
to
search
any
woman
who
walks
in
here
and
what
in
the
world
would
i
want
a
paper
of
tausig
for
you
wo
give
it
up
then
he
tapped
a
bell
a
woman
came
in
i
had
a
bad
minute
there
but
it
did
last
it
was
the
matron
i
brought
the
baby
to
you
take
this
girl
into
the
other
room
and
search
her
thoroughly
the
thing
we
looking
for
the
sergeant
turned
to
tausig
a
small
paper
he
said
eagerly
a
a
contract
just
a
single
sheet
of
legal
cap
paper
it
was
and
signed
by
myself
and
some
other
gentlemen
and
folded
twice
the
woman
looked
at
me
she
was
a
bit
with
hair
but
her
eyes
looked
as
though
they
seen
a
lot
and
learned
not
to
flinch
though
they
still
felt
like
it
i
knew
that
kind
of
look
i
seen
it
at
the
cruelty
what
an
unpleasant
job
this
of
yours
is
i
said
to
her
smiling
up
at
her
for
all
the
world
as
that
tike
of
a
baby
had
smiled
at
me
and
watching
her
melt
just
as
i
had
i
not
make
it
a
bit
harder
this
thing
all
a
mistake
which
way
i
come
back
tausig
to
receive
your
apology
but
you
can
hardly
expect
me
to
go
to
lunch
after
this
he
growled
a
wrathful
resenting
mouthful
but
he
looked
a
bit
puzzled
just
the
same
he
looked
more
puzzled
yet
even
bewildered
when
we
came
back
into
the
main
office
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
woman
and
i
and
she
reported
that
no
paper
of
any
kind
had
she
found
me
oh
i
was
sweet
amiability
personified
with
the
woman
and
with
the
sergeant
who
began
to
furiously
but
with
tausig
what
you
do
mean
to
say
you
not
on
mag
oh
dear
dear
well
you
had
that
beautiful
wig
of
red
hair
that
puts
even
carter
in
the
shade
for
you
never
have
been
a
success
in
in
other
businesses
i
might
name
bamboozled
the
woman
not
a
bit
of
it
you
ca
deceive
women
with
mouths
and
eyes
like
that
it
was
just
that
i
had
a
flash
of
genius
in
the
minute
i
heard
tausig
voice
and
in
spite
of
my
being
so
sure
he
would
have
me
arrested
i
guess
mag
guess
there
was
only
one
way
the
baby
of
course
in
the
moment
i
had
it
was
long
i
stooped
down
pretending
to
kiss
that
cherub
and
in
a
jiffy
i
pinned
that
precious
paper
with
a
to
the
baby
preferring
that
risk
to
risk
i
should
say
it
was
and
now
it
was
up
to
nance
to
make
good
while
tausig
insisted
and
explained
and
expostulated
and
at
last
walked
out
with
the
sergeant
giving
me
a
queer
last
look
that
was
i
stood
chatting
sweetly
with
the
woman
who
had
searched
me
i
did
know
just
how
far
i
might
go
with
her
she
knew
the
paper
was
on
me
and
i
could
see
she
was
disposed
to
believe
i
was
as
nice
as
she
have
liked
me
to
be
but
she
had
a
lot
of
experience
and
she
knew
as
most
women
do
even
without
experience
that
if
there
not
always
fire
where
there
is
smoke
it
because
somebody
been
clever
enough
and
quick
enough
to
cover
the
blaze
well
i
said
putting
out
my
hand
it
been
disagreeable
but
i
obliged
to
you
for
why
where
my
purse
we
must
have
left
it
and
i
turned
to
go
back
into
the
room
where
i
undressed
you
did
have
any
the
words
came
clear
and
cold
and
positive
her
tone
was
like
an
icicle
down
my
back
i
did
have
any
i
exclaimed
why
i
certainly
you
certainly
had
no
purse
for
i
should
have
seen
it
and
searched
it
if
you
had
now
what
do
you
think
of
a
woman
like
that
nancy
olden
i
said
to
myself
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
met
your
match
right
here
when
a
woman
knows
a
fact
and
states
it
with
such
quiet
conviction
without
the
least
unnecessary
emphasis
and
not
a
superfluous
word
that
woman
there
only
one
game
to
play
to
let
you
hang
round
here
a
bit
longer
and
find
out
what
become
of
the
baby
play
it
i
looked
at
her
with
respect
it
was
both
real
and
feigned
of
course
you
must
be
right
i
said
humbly
i
know
you
would
be
likely
to
make
a
mistake
but
just
to
convince
me
do
you
mind
letting
me
go
back
to
look
not
at
all
she
said
placidly
if
i
go
with
you
there
no
reason
why
you
should
not
look
oh
mag
it
was
hard
lines
looking
why
why
because
the
place
was
so
bare
and
so
small
there
were
so
few
things
to
move
and
it
took
such
a
short
time
in
spite
of
all
i
could
do
and
pretend
to
do
that
i
was
in
despair
you
must
be
right
i
said
at
length
looking
woefully
up
at
her
yes
i
knew
i
was
she
said
steadily
i
must
have
lost
it
yes
there
was
no
hope
there
i
turned
to
go
i
lend
you
a
nickel
to
get
home
if
you
leave
me
your
address
she
said
after
a
moment
oh
that
admirable
woman
she
ought
to
be
ruling
empires
instead
of
searching
thieves
look
at
the
balance
of
her
mag
my
best
acting
had
shaken
her
she
had
that
fatal
curiosity
to
understand
motives
that
wrecks
so
many
who
deal
with
we
call
them
the
temporarily
she
was
satisfied
just
not
to
let
me
get
ahead
of
her
in
the
least
particular
but
she
was
mean
and
she
would
lend
me
a
nickel
not
an
emotionally
extravagant
piece
but
just
a
nickel
on
the
chance
that
i
was
what
i
seemed
to
be
oh
i
did
admire
her
but
i
have
been
more
enthusiastic
about
it
if
i
could
have
seen
my
way
clear
to
the
baby
and
the
paper
i
took
the
nickel
and
thanked
her
but
effusiveness
left
her
unmoved
a
wholesome
rock
with
a
neat
white
apron
that
what
she
was
and
still
i
lingered
fancy
nance
olden
just
heartbroken
at
being
compelled
to
leave
a
police
station
but
there
was
nothing
for
it
go
i
had
to
my
head
was
with
schemes
coming
forward
with
suggestions
and
being
dismissed
as
unsuitable
my
thoughts
were
flying
about
at
such
a
dizzy
rate
while
i
stood
there
in
the
doorway
the
woman
patient
hand
on
the
knob
and
her
watchful
eyes
on
me
that
i
actually
mag
i
actually
did
hear
the
matron
voice
the
first
time
she
spoke
the
second
time
though
i
turned
so
happy
i
could
not
keep
the
tremor
out
of
my
voice
i
thought
you
had
gone
long
ago
she
said
oh
we
were
friends
we
two
we
chummed
over
a
baby
which
for
women
is
like
what
taking
a
drink
together
is
for
men
the
admirable
dragon
in
the
blue
dress
did
waver
a
bit
because
her
superior
spoke
pleasantly
to
me
she
only
watched
and
listened
which
puts
you
in
a
difficult
position
when
your
name
nance
olden
you
have
to
tell
the
truth
i
been
detained
i
said
with
dignity
against
my
wish
but
all
over
i
going
now
i
nodded
and
caught
up
my
skirt
oh
i
paused
just
as
the
admirable
dragon
was
closing
the
door
on
me
is
the
baby
asleep
i
wonder
if
i
might
see
her
once
more
my
heart
was
beating
like
an
engine
gone
mad
in
spite
of
my
careless
tone
and
there
was
a
buzzing
in
my
ears
that
deafened
me
but
i
managed
to
stand
still
and
listen
and
then
to
walk
off
as
though
it
did
matter
in
the
least
to
me
while
her
words
came
smashing
the
hope
out
of
me
we
sent
her
with
an
officer
back
to
the
neighborhood
where
you
found
her
he
find
out
where
she
belongs
no
doubt
good
day
xv
ah
me
maggie
the
miserable
nance
that
went
away
from
that
station
to
have
had
your
future
in
your
grasp
like
that
one
of
the
fates
with
the
string
and
then
to
have
it
snatched
from
you
by
an
impish
breeze
and
blown
away
goodness
knows
where
i
do
know
just
which
way
i
turned
after
i
left
that
station
i
did
care
where
i
went
nothing
i
could
think
of
gave
me
any
comfort
i
tried
to
fancy
myself
coming
home
to
you
i
tried
to
see
myself
going
down
to
tell
the
whole
thing
to
obermuller
but
i
could
do
that
there
was
only
one
thing
i
wanted
to
say
to
fred
obermuller
and
that
thing
i
could
say
now
but
nance
olden
not
the
girl
to
go
round
long
like
a
molting
hen
there
was
only
one
chance
in
a
hundred
and
that
was
the
one
i
took
of
course
back
to
the
square
where
you
found
the
baby
nance
i
cried
to
myself
there
the
chance
that
that
admirable
dragon
has
had
her
suspicions
aroused
by
your
connection
with
the
baby
which
she
known
before
and
has
already
dutifully
notified
the
sergeant
the
chance
that
the
baby
is
home
by
now
and
the
paper
found
by
her
mother
will
be
turned
over
to
her
papa
and
then
it
to
your
scheme
there
the
chance
that
but
in
the
heart
of
me
i
did
believe
in
any
chance
but
one
the
chance
that
i
find
that
blessed
baby
and
get
my
fingers
just
once
more
on
that
precious
paper
i
blew
in
the
nickel
on
a
car
and
got
back
to
the
little
square
there
was
another
there
grinding
out
to
which
other
piccaninnies
danced
but
nary
a
little
white
bundle
of
fluff
caught
hold
of
my
hand
i
walked
that
square
till
my
feet
were
sore
it
was
hot
my
throat
was
parched
i
was
hungry
my
head
ached
i
was
hopeless
and
yet
i
just
could
give
it
up
i
had
asked
so
many
children
and
whether
heard
of
the
baby
lost
that
morning
and
brought
back
by
an
officer
that
they
began
to
look
at
me
as
though
i
was
not
quite
right
in
my
mind
the
maids
grabbed
the
children
if
they
started
to
come
near
me
and
the
children
stared
at
me
with
big
round
eyes
as
though
been
told
i
was
an
ogre
who
might
eat
them
i
was
hungry
enough
to
the
little
at
the
entrance
had
a
fascination
for
me
i
found
myself
there
time
and
again
till
i
got
afraid
i
might
actually
try
to
get
of
with
a
peach
or
a
bunch
of
grapes
that
thought
haunted
me
fancy
nance
olden
starved
and
blundering
into
the
cheapest
and
most
easily
detected
species
of
thieving
i
suppose
great
generals
in
their
hour
of
defeat
imagine
themselves
doing
the
feeblest
foolishest
things
as
i
sat
there
on
the
bench
gazing
before
me
i
saw
the
whole
thing
nancy
olden
after
all
her
bragging
her
skirmishing
her
hairbreadth
scapes
and
successes
arrested
in
broad
daylight
and
before
witnesses
for
having
stolen
a
cool
wet
bunch
of
grapes
worth
a
nickel
for
her
hot
dry
hungering
throat
i
saw
the
policeman
that
do
it
he
looked
like
that
sergeant
mulhill
i
met
back
in
latimer
garden
i
saw
the
officer
that
receive
me
he
had
blue
eyes
like
the
detective
that
came
for
me
to
the
manhattan
i
saw
the
woman
jailer
oh
she
was
the
all
right
who
receive
me
without
the
slightest
emotion
show
me
to
a
cell
and
lock
the
door
as
calm
as
little
triumphant
or
affected
as
though
i
had
once
outwitted
that
cleverest
of
creatures
and
outwitted
myself
in
forestalling
her
i
saw
mag
guess
what
i
saw
no
truly
what
i
really
saw
it
made
me
jump
to
my
feet
and
grab
it
with
a
squeal
i
saw
my
own
purse
lying
on
the
gravel
almost
at
my
feet
near
the
little
that
had
tempted
me
blank
empty
it
was
stripped
clean
not
a
penny
left
in
it
not
a
paper
not
a
stamp
not
even
my
key
just
the
same
i
was
glad
to
have
it
it
linked
me
in
a
way
to
the
place
the
clever
little
girl
that
had
stolen
it
had
been
here
in
this
park
on
this
very
spot
the
thought
of
that
cute
young
nance
olden
distracted
my
mind
a
minute
from
my
worry
and
oh
maggie
darlin
i
was
worrying
so
i
walked
up
to
the
with
the
purse
in
my
hand
the
old
fellow
who
kept
it
looked
up
with
an
inviting
smile
lord
knows
he
need
have
encouraged
me
to
buy
if
i
had
a
penny
i
want
to
ask
you
i
said
if
you
remember
selling
a
lot
of
good
things
to
a
little
girl
who
had
a
purse
this
this
morning
i
showed
it
to
him
and
he
turned
it
over
in
his
crippled
old
hands
it
was
full
then
or
fuller
anyway
i
suggested
you
would
want
to
get
her
into
trouble
that
little
girl
he
asked
cautiously
i
laughed
not
i
myself
i
was
going
to
say
well
you
can
imagine
what
i
was
going
to
say
and
that
i
did
say
it
or
anything
like
it
well
there
she
is
kitty
wilson
over
yonder
he
said
i
gasped
it
was
so
unexpected
and
i
turned
to
look
there
on
one
of
the
benches
sat
kitty
wilson
if
i
had
been
blind
as
a
bat
and
full
of
trouble
oh
it
thickens
your
wits
does
trouble
and
blinds
your
eyes
and
muffles
your
ears
i
have
suspected
something
at
the
mere
sight
of
her
for
there
sat
kitty
wilson
enthroned
a
hatless
lank
little
creature
about
twelve
and
near
her
clustered
thick
as
ants
around
a
lump
of
sugar
was
a
crowd
of
children
black
and
white
boys
and
girls
for
kitty
that
deplorable
kitty
had
money
to
burn
or
what
was
even
more
effective
at
her
age
she
had
goodies
to
give
away
her
lap
was
full
of
spoils
she
had
a
sample
of
every
good
thing
the
offered
her
cheeks
and
lips
were
smeary
with
candy
her
dress
was
stained
with
fruit
the
crumbs
of
cake
lingered
still
on
her
chin
and
apron
and
kitty
i
love
a
generous
thief
was
treating
the
gang
it
helped
itself
from
her
abundant
lap
it
munched
and
gobbled
and
asked
for
more
it
was
a
riot
of
a
high
old
time
even
the
birds
were
hopping
about
as
near
as
they
dared
picking
up
the
crumbs
and
the
squirrels
had
peanuts
to
throw
to
the
birds
and
all
on
nancy
olden
money
i
laughed
till
i
shook
it
was
good
to
laugh
nancy
olden
accustomed
to
a
long
dose
of
the
doleful
and
it
does
agree
with
her
i
strolled
over
to
where
my
guests
were
banqueting
you
see
mag
that
where
i
should
rank
with
the
i
too
inquisitive
i
want
to
know
how
the
other
fellow
in
the
case
feels
and
thinks
it
is
enough
for
me
to
see
him
act
kitty
i
said
somehow
a
makes
you
feel
more
of
a
than
a
does
i
hope
you
having
a
good
time
kitty
wilson
but
have
you
lost
something
she
was
chewing
at
the
end
of
a
long
string
of
black
all
right
the
stuff
looks
like
and
she
was
eating
just
because
she
did
want
to
stop
goodness
knows
she
was
full
enough
her
jaws
stopped
though
suddenly
as
she
looked
from
the
empty
purse
in
my
outstretched
hand
to
me
and
took
me
in
oh
i
know
that
pause
intimately
it
says
wait
a
minute
till
i
get
my
breath
and
i
know
how
much
you
know
and
just
what
lie
to
tell
you
but
she
changed
her
mind
when
she
saw
my
face
you
know
mag
if
there
a
thing
that
fixed
in
your
memory
it
the
face
of
the
body
you
done
up
the
respectables
have
their
rogues
gallery
but
we
that
is
the
brigade
have
got
a
fools
gallery
to
correspond
to
it
in
which
of
is
my
picture
now
margaret
that
mean
you
know
my
portrait
hangs
in
both
i
looked
down
on
the
little
beggar
that
had
painted
me
for
the
second
salon
and
lo
in
a
flash
she
was
on
her
feet
the
lapful
of
good
things
tumbled
to
the
ground
and
kitty
was
off
i
was
bitterly
disappointed
in
that
girl
mag
i
was
altogether
mistaken
in
my
diagnosis
of
her
hers
is
only
a
physical
cleverness
a
talented
dexterity
she
had
no
resource
in
time
of
danger
but
her
legs
and
legs
will
not
carry
a
grafter
half
so
far
as
a
good
quick
tongue
and
a
steady
head
she
halted
at
a
safe
distance
and
glared
back
at
me
her
hostility
excited
the
crowd
of
children
her
push
against
me
and
the
braver
ones
jeered
the
things
kitty
only
looked
while
the
thrifty
ones
stooped
and
gathered
up
the
spoil
tell
her
i
would
harm
her
i
said
to
one
of
her
lieutenants
she
says
she
wo
hurt
ye
kit
the
child
screamed
she
dassent
yelled
back
kitty
the
valiant
she
knows
i
peach
on
her
about
the
kid
kid
what
kid
i
cried
all
the
kid
ye
swiped
this
mornin
yah
i
told
the
cop
what
brought
her
back
how
ye
took
her
jest
as
i
kitty
i
cried
you
treasure
and
with
all
my
might
i
ran
after
her
silly
of
course
it
was
i
might
have
known
what
the
short
skirts
above
those
thin
legs
meant
i
could
come
within
fifty
feet
of
her
i
halted
panting
and
she
paused
too
dancing
tantalizingly
half
a
block
away
what
to
do
i
wished
i
had
another
purse
to
bestow
on
that
sad
kitty
but
i
had
nothing
absolutely
nothing
except
all
at
once
i
remembered
it
that
little
pin
you
gave
me
for
christmas
mag
i
took
it
off
and
turned
to
appeal
to
the
nearest
one
of
the
flying
that
had
accompanied
us
you
run
on
to
her
and
tell
her
that
if
she
show
me
the
house
where
that
baby
lives
i
give
her
this
pin
he
sped
on
ahead
and
parleyed
with
kit
and
while
they
talked
i
held
aloft
the
little
pin
so
that
kit
might
see
the
price
she
hesitated
so
long
that
i
feared
she
slip
through
my
hands
but
a
sudden
rival
voice
piping
out
i
show
ye
the
house
missus
was
too
much
for
her
so
with
kit
at
a
safe
distance
in
advance
to
guard
against
treachery
and
a
large
and
enthusiastic
following
i
crossed
the
street
turned
a
corner
walked
down
one
block
and
half
up
another
and
halted
before
a
brownstone
i
flew
up
the
stairs
leaving
my
escort
behind
and
rang
the
bell
it
was
so
terribly
swagger
a
place
which
relieved
me
some
i
want
to
see
the
lady
whose
baby
was
lost
this
morning
i
said
to
the
maid
that
opened
the
door
yes
who
i
tell
her
who
that
stumped
me
not
nance
olden
late
of
the
vaudeville
later
of
the
van
twiller
and
latest
of
the
police
station
no
not
nance
olden
not
tell
her
please
i
said
firmly
that
i
miss
murieson
of
the
and
that
the
city
editor
has
sent
me
here
to
see
her
that
did
it
hooray
for
the
power
of
the
press
she
showed
me
into
a
long
parlor
and
i
sat
down
and
waited
it
was
cool
and
quiet
and
softly
pretty
in
that
long
parlor
the
shades
were
down
the
piano
was
open
the
chairs
were
low
and
softly
cushioned
i
leaned
back
and
closed
my
eyes
exhausted
and
suddenly
mag
i
felt
something
that
was
a
cross
between
a
and
a
snowflake
touch
my
hand
if
it
was
that
delectable
baby
i
caught
her
and
lifted
her
to
my
lap
and
hugged
the
chuckling
thing
as
though
that
was
what
i
came
for
then
in
a
moment
i
remembered
the
paper
and
lifted
her
little
white
slip
it
was
gone
mag
the
had
a
sign
of
the
paper
pinned
to
it
my
head
whirled
in
that
minute
i
suppose
i
was
faint
with
the
heat
with
hunger
and
fatigue
and
worry
but
i
felt
myself
slipping
out
of
things
when
i
heard
the
rustling
of
skirts
and
there
before
me
stood
the
mother
of
my
baby
the
little
wretch
she
deserted
me
and
flew
to
that
pretty
mother
of
hers
in
her
long
cool
white
trailing
things
and
sat
in
her
arms
and
mocked
at
me
it
was
easy
enough
to
begin
talking
i
told
her
a
tale
about
being
a
newspaper
woman
out
on
a
story
how
i
run
across
the
baby
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
must
ask
your
pardon
i
finished
up
for
disturbing
you
but
two
things
sent
me
here
one
to
know
if
the
baby
got
home
safe
and
the
other
i
gulped
to
ask
about
a
paper
with
some
notes
that
i
pinned
to
her
skirt
she
shook
her
head
it
was
in
that
very
minute
that
i
noticed
the
baby
ribbons
were
pink
they
had
been
blue
in
the
morning
of
course
i
suggested
you
had
her
clothes
changed
and
why
yes
of
course
said
baby
mother
the
first
thing
i
did
when
i
got
hold
of
her
was
to
strip
her
and
put
her
in
a
tub
the
second
was
to
discharge
that
gossiping
nurse
for
letting
her
out
of
her
sight
and
the
soiled
things
she
had
on
the
dress
with
the
blue
ribbons
i
find
out
she
said
she
rang
for
the
maid
and
gave
her
an
order
was
it
a
valuable
paper
she
asked
not
very
i
stammered
my
tongue
was
thick
with
hope
and
dread
just
my
notes
you
know
but
i
do
need
them
i
could
carry
the
baby
easily
so
i
pinned
them
on
her
skirt
thinking
thinking
the
maid
came
in
and
dumped
a
little
heap
of
white
before
me
i
fell
on
my
knees
oh
yes
i
prayed
all
right
but
i
searched
too
and
there
it
was
what
i
said
to
that
woman
i
do
know
even
now
i
flew
out
through
the
hall
and
down
the
steps
and
and
there
kitty
wilson
corralled
me
say
where
that
she
cried
here
here
you
darling
i
said
pressing
it
into
her
hand
and
kitty
whenever
you
feel
like
swiping
another
purse
just
do
do
it
it
does
pay
just
you
come
down
to
the
vaudeville
and
ask
for
nance
olden
some
day
and
i
tell
you
why
gee
said
kitty
impressed
shall
shall
i
call
ye
a
hansom
lady
should
she
the
blessed
inspiration
of
her
i
got
into
the
wagon
and
we
drove
down
street
to
the
vaudeville
i
burst
in
past
the
stage
doorkeeper
amazed
to
see
me
and
rushed
into
fred
obermuller
office
there
i
cried
throwing
that
awful
paper
on
the
desk
before
him
now
cinch
fred
obermuller
as
they
cinched
you
it
be
the
holiest
blackmail
that
ever
oh
and
will
you
pay
for
the
hansom
xvi
i
do
remember
much
about
the
first
part
of
the
lunch
i
was
so
hungry
i
wanted
to
eat
everything
in
sight
and
so
happy
that
i
could
eat
a
thing
but
kept
piling
the
things
on
my
plate
and
each
time
i
began
to
talk
he
say
not
now
wait
till
you
rested
and
not
quite
so
famished
i
laughed
do
i
eat
as
though
i
was
starved
you
you
look
tired
nance
well
i
said
slowly
it
been
a
hard
week
it
been
hard
for
me
too
harder
i
think
than
for
you
it
fair
to
me
to
let
me
think
what
i
did
and
say
what
i
did
i
so
sorry
nance
and
ashamed
so
ashamed
you
might
have
told
me
and
have
you
put
your
foot
down
on
the
whole
thing
not
much
he
laughed
he
got
such
a
boyish
laugh
in
spite
of
his
chin
and
his
and
the
bigness
of
him
he
filled
my
glass
for
me
and
helped
me
again
to
the
salad
oh
mag
it
such
fun
to
be
a
woman
and
have
a
man
wait
on
you
like
that
it
such
fun
to
be
hungry
and
to
sit
down
to
a
jolly
little
table
just
big
enough
for
two
with
carnations
nodding
in
the
tall
slim
vase
with
a
fat
waiter
dancing
behind
you
and
something
tempting
in
every
dish
your
eye
falls
on
it
a
gay
happy
easy
world
maggie
darlin
i
vow
i
ca
find
a
dark
corner
in
it
not
none
but
the
swellest
place
in
town
was
good
enough
obermuller
had
said
for
us
to
celebrate
in
the
waiters
looked
queerly
at
us
when
we
came
in
me
in
my
dusty
shoes
and
mussed
hair
and
old
rig
and
in
his
working
togs
but
do
you
suppose
we
cared
he
was
smoking
and
i
was
pretending
to
eat
fruit
when
at
last
i
got
fairly
launched
on
my
story
he
listened
to
it
all
with
never
a
word
of
interruption
sometimes
i
thought
he
was
so
interested
that
he
could
bear
to
miss
a
word
i
said
and
then
again
i
fancied
he
was
listening
at
all
to
me
only
watching
me
and
listening
to
something
inside
of
himself
can
you
see
him
mag
sitting
opposite
me
there
at
the
pretty
little
table
off
in
a
private
room
by
ourselves
he
looked
so
big
and
strong
and
masterful
with
his
eyes
half
closed
watching
me
that
i
hugged
myself
with
delight
to
think
that
i
i
nancy
olden
had
done
something
for
him
he
could
do
for
himself
it
made
me
so
proud
so
tipsily
vain
that
as
i
leaned
forward
eagerly
talking
i
felt
that
same
intoxicating
happiness
i
get
on
the
stage
when
the
audience
is
all
with
me
and
the
two
of
us
myself
and
the
other
fellow
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
footlights
go
careering
off
on
a
jaunt
of
fun
and
fancy
like
two
good
playmates
he
was
silent
a
minute
when
i
got
through
then
he
laid
his
cigar
aside
and
stretched
out
his
hand
to
me
and
the
reason
nance
the
reason
for
it
all
i
looked
up
at
him
i
never
heard
him
speak
like
that
the
reason
i
repeated
yes
the
reason
he
had
caught
my
hand
why
to
down
that
tiger
trust
and
beat
tausig
he
laughed
and
that
was
all
nonsense
nance
olden
there
was
another
reason
there
are
other
tiger
trusts
are
you
going
to
set
up
as
a
and
right
all
syndicate
wrongs
no
there
was
another
a
bigger
reason
nance
i
going
to
tell
it
to
you
what
i
pulled
my
hand
from
his
but
not
before
that
fat
waiter
who
come
in
without
our
noticing
had
got
something
to
grin
about
beg
pardon
sir
he
said
this
message
must
be
for
you
sir
marked
immediate
and
no
one
else
obermuller
took
it
and
tore
it
open
he
smiled
the
oddest
smile
as
he
read
it
and
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
a
full
hearty
bellow
when
he
got
to
the
end
read
it
nance
he
said
passing
it
over
to
me
they
sent
it
on
from
the
office
i
read
it
fred
obermuller
manager
vaudeville
theater
new
york
city
dear
obermuller
i
have
just
learned
from
your
little
protegee
nance
olden
of
a
comedy
you
written
from
what
miss
olden
tells
me
of
the
plot
and
situations
of
and
the
greatest
of
these
your
great
i
judge
the
thing
to
be
something
altogether
out
of
the
common
and
my
secretary
and
reader
mason
agrees
with
me
that
properly
interpreted
and
perhaps
touched
up
here
and
there
the
comedy
ought
to
make
a
hit
would
miss
olden
take
the
leading
role
i
wonder
ca
you
drop
in
this
evening
and
talk
the
matter
over
there
an
opening
for
a
fellow
like
you
with
us
that
just
developed
within
the
past
few
days
and
this
is
strictly
confidential
i
have
succeeded
in
convincing
braun
and
lowenthal
that
their
enmity
is
a
foolish
personal
matter
which
business
men
should
let
stand
in
the
way
of
business
after
all
just
what
is
there
between
you
and
them
a
mere
trifle
a
misunderstanding
that
half
an
hour
talk
over
a
bottle
of
wine
with
a
good
cigar
would
drive
away
if
you
the
man
i
take
you
for
you
drop
in
this
evening
at
the
van
twiller
and
bury
the
hatchet
they
good
fellows
those
two
and
smart
men
even
if
they
are
stubborn
as
sin
counting
on
seeing
you
my
dear
fellow
i
am
most
cordially
m
tausig
i
dropped
the
letter
and
looked
over
at
obermuller
miss
olden
he
said
severely
coming
over
to
my
side
of
the
table
have
you
the
heart
to
harm
a
generous
soul
like
that
he
he
very
prompt
is
he
and
most
and
then
we
laughed
together
you
notice
the
letter
was
marked
personal
obermuller
said
he
was
still
standing
beside
me
no
was
it
i
got
up
too
and
began
to
pull
on
my
gloves
but
my
fingers
shook
so
i
could
do
a
thing
with
them
oh
yes
it
was
that
why
i
showed
it
to
you
nance
nance
you
see
that
there
only
one
way
out
of
this
there
only
one
woman
in
the
world
that
would
do
this
for
me
and
that
i
could
take
it
from
i
clasped
my
hands
helplessly
oh
what
could
i
do
maggie
with
him
there
and
his
arms
ready
for
me
i
i
should
think
you
be
afraid
i
whispered
i
did
dare
look
at
him
he
caught
me
to
him
then
afraid
you
would
care
for
an
old
fellow
like
me
he
laughed
yes
that
the
only
fear
i
had
but
i
lost
it
nancy
nancy
obermuller
when
you
flung
that
paper
down
before
me
that
quite
two
hours
ago
have
i
waited
long
enough
oh
mag
mag
how
can
i
tell
him
do
you
think
he
knows
that
i
am
going
to
be
good
good
that
i
can
be
as
good
for
a
good
man
who
loves
me
as
i
was
bad
for
a
bad
man
i
loved
xvii
philadelphia
january
maggie
dear
i
writing
to
you
just
before
dinner
while
i
wait
for
fred
he
down
at
the
looking
up
advance
sales
i
tell
you
maggie
monahan
we
strictly
in
it
we
obermullers
that
broadway
hit
of
mine
has
preceded
me
here
and
we
got
the
town
i
suspect
in
advance
but
i
not
writing
to
tell
you
this
i
got
something
more
interesting
to
tell
you
my
dear
old
cruelty
chum
i
want
you
to
pretend
to
yourself
that
you
see
me
mag
as
i
came
out
of
the
big
chestnut
street
store
this
afternoon
my
arms
full
of
bundles
i
must
have
on
that
long
coat
to
my
heels
of
dark
warm
red
with
the
long
incurving
back
sweep
and
high
chinchilla
collar
that
fred
ordered
made
for
me
the
very
day
we
were
married
i
must
be
wearing
that
jolly
little
toque
caught
up
on
the
side
with
some
of
the
fur
oh
yes
i
knew
i
was
more
than
a
year
behind
the
times
when
i
got
them
but
a
successful
actress
wears
what
she
pleases
and
the
rest
of
the
world
wears
what
pleases
her
too
besides
fashions
do
mean
so
much
to
you
when
your
husband
tells
you
how
becoming
but
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
bishop
yes
the
bishop
mag
i
had
just
said
nance
olden
to
myself
i
still
speak
to
me
as
nancy
olden
it
good
for
me
mag
keeps
me
humble
and
for
ever
grateful
that
i
so
happy
nance
you
never
be
able
to
carry
all
these
things
and
lift
your
buful
train
too
and
there
never
a
hansom
round
when
it
snowing
and
and
then
i
caught
sight
of
the
carriage
yes
maggie
the
same
fat
low
comfortable
elegant
sober
carriage
wide
and
with
wheels
and
the
two
heavy
horses
fat
and
elegant
and
sober
too
and
wide
and
i
knew
whose
it
was
the
minute
my
eyes
lighted
on
it
and
i
could
i
just
could
resist
it
the
man
on
the
wide
and
was
this
time
i
nodded
to
him
as
i
slipped
in
and
closed
the
door
after
me
i
wait
for
the
bishop
i
said
with
a
assurance
that
left
him
no
alternative
but
to
accept
the
situation
respectfully
oh
dear
dear
it
was
soft
and
warm
inside
as
it
had
been
that
long
day
the
seat
was
wide
and
roomy
the
cushions
had
been
done
over
i
resented
that
but
though
a
different
material
they
were
a
still
darker
plum
and
instead
of
quo
vadis
the
bishop
had
been
reading
resurrection
i
took
it
up
and
glanced
over
it
as
i
sat
there
but
you
know
mag
the
plays
never
appealed
to
me
i
do
go
in
for
the
tragic
perhaps
i
saw
too
much
of
the
real
thing
when
i
was
little
at
any
rate
it
seemed
dull
to
me
and
i
put
it
aside
and
sat
there
dreaming
of
a
little
that
i
knew
once
when
when
the
handle
of
the
door
turned
and
the
bishop
got
in
and
we
were
off
oh
the
little
bishop
the
contrast
between
him
and
the
fat
pompous
rig
caught
me
he
seemed
littler
and
leaner
than
ever
his
little
white
beard
scantier
his
soft
eye
kindlier
and
his
soft
heart
god
bless
my
soul
he
exclaimed
jumping
almost
out
of
his
neat
little
boots
while
he
looked
sharply
over
his
spectacles
what
did
he
see
just
a
ghost
dreaming
in
the
corner
of
his
carriage
it
made
him
doubt
his
eyes
his
sanity
i
do
know
what
he
have
done
if
that
warm
red
ghost
had
got
tired
of
dreaming
and
laughed
outright
daddy
i
murmured
sleepily
oh
that
little
ramrod
of
a
bishop
the
blood
rushed
up
under
his
clear
thin
skin
and
he
sat
up
straight
and
solemn
and
awful
awful
as
such
a
tiny
bishop
could
be
i
fear
miss
you
have
made
a
mistake
he
said
primly
i
looked
at
him
steadily
you
know
i
have
i
said
gently
that
took
some
of
the
starch
out
of
him
but
he
eyed
me
suspiciously
why
do
you
ask
me
where
i
got
the
coat
bishop
van
wagenen
i
said
leaning
over
to
him
he
started
i
suppose
he
just
that
moment
remembered
my
leaving
it
behind
that
day
at
ramsay
lord
bless
me
he
cried
anxiously
you
have
you
have
again
no
i
have
ah
maggie
dear
it
was
worth
a
lot
to
me
to
be
able
to
say
that
no
to
him
it
was
given
to
me
guess
who
gave
it
to
me
he
shook
his
head
my
husband
maggie
monahan
he
did
even
blink
perhaps
in
the
bishop
set
husbands
are
not
uncommon
or
very
likely
they
do
know
what
a
husband
like
fred
obermuller
means
i
congratulate
you
my
child
or
or
did
it
were
you
why
i
never
seen
fred
obermuller
then
i
cried
ca
you
tell
a
difference
bishop
i
pleaded
do
i
look
like
a
an
imposing
married
woman
now
do
i
seem
a
bit
oh
just
a
bit
nicer
his
eyes
twinkled
as
he
bent
to
look
more
closely
at
me
you
look
you
look
my
little
girl
exactly
like
the
pretty
child
i
wished
to
have
for
my
own
daughter
i
caught
his
hand
in
both
of
mine
now
that
like
my
own
own
bishop
i
cried
mag
mag
he
was
blushing
like
a
boy
a
prim
rather
scared
little
that
somehow
yet
oh
i
knew
he
must
feel
kindly
to
me
i
felt
so
fond
of
him
you
see
bishop
van
wagenen
i
began
softly
i
never
had
a
father
and
bless
me
but
you
told
me
that
day
you
had
mistaken
me
for
for
him
the
baby
i
had
forgotten
what
that
old
edward
told
me
that
this
trusting
soul
actually
still
believed
all
i
told
him
what
was
i
to
do
i
tell
you
mag
it
no
light
thing
to
get
accustomed
to
telling
the
truth
you
never
know
where
it
lead
you
here
was
i
just
a
clever
little
lie
or
two
and
the
dear
old
bishop
would
be
happy
and
contented
again
but
no
that
fatal
habit
that
i
acquired
of
telling
the
truth
to
fred
and
you
mastered
me
and
i
fell
you
know
bishop
i
said
shutting
my
eyes
and
speaking
fast
to
get
it
over
as
i
imagine
you
must
mag
when
you
confess
to
father
phelan
that
was
all
a
a
little
the
whole
business
all
of
it
every
last
word
of
it
a
comedy
i
opened
my
eyes
to
laugh
at
him
he
was
so
bewildered
i
mean
a
a
fib
in
fact
many
of
them
i
i
was
just
it
was
long
ago
and
i
had
to
make
you
believe
his
soft
old
eyes
looked
at
me
unbelieving
you
do
mean
to
say
you
deliberately
lied
now
that
was
what
i
did
mean
just
what
i
did
mean
but
not
in
that
tone
of
voice
but
what
could
i
do
i
just
looked
at
him
and
nodded
oh
maggie
i
felt
so
little
and
so
nasty
i
have
felt
like
that
since
i
left
the
cruelty
and
i
not
nasty
maggie
and
i
fred
obermuller
wife
and
and
that
put
a
backbone
in
me
again
fred
obermuller
wife
just
let
anybody
think
worse
of
her
than
she
can
help
from
sheer
love
and
pride
in
that
big
clever
husband
of
hers
now
look
here
bishop
van
wagenen
i
broke
out
if
i
were
the
abandoned
little
wretch
your
eyes
accuse
me
of
being
i
would
be
in
your
carriage
confessing
to
you
this
blessed
minute
when
it
be
so
much
easier
not
to
surely
surely
in
your
experience
you
must
have
met
girls
that
go
wrong
and
then
go
right
for
ever
and
ever
amen
and
i
very
right
now
but
but
it
has
been
hard
for
me
at
times
and
at
those
times
ah
you
must
know
how
sincerely
i
mean
it
at
those
times
i
used
to
try
to
recall
the
sound
of
your
voice
when
you
said
you
like
to
take
me
home
with
you
and
keep
me
if
i
had
been
your
daughter
you
have
had
a
heart
full
of
loving
care
for
me
and
yet
if
i
had
been
and
had
known
that
benevolent
fatherhood
i
should
need
it
less
so
much
less
than
i
did
the
day
i
begged
a
prayer
from
you
but
it
all
right
now
you
do
know
do
you
i
nance
olden
that
made
him
sit
up
and
stare
i
tell
you
even
the
bishop
had
heard
of
nancy
olden
but
suddenly
unaccountably
there
came
a
queer
sad
look
over
his
face
and
his
eyes
would
meet
mine
i
looked
at
him
puzzled
tell
me
what
it
is
i
said
you
evidently
forget
that
you
have
already
told
me
you
are
the
wife
of
ober
obermuller
oh
that
all
right
i
laughed
aloud
i
was
so
relieved
of
course
i
am
and
he
my
manager
and
my
playwright
and
my
secretary
and
my
my
dear
dear
boy
there
i
was
laughing
at
the
end
of
it
i
never
can
laugh
when
i
try
to
tell
what
fred
is
to
me
but
funny
that
won
him
there
there
he
said
patting
me
on
the
shoulder
forgive
me
my
dear
i
am
indeed
glad
to
know
that
you
are
living
happily
i
have
often
thought
of
you
oh
have
you
yes
i
have
even
told
van
wagenen
about
you
and
how
i
was
attracted
to
you
and
believed
ahem
oh
oh
have
you
i
gave
a
wriggle
as
i
remembered
that
maltese
lace
maria
wanted
and
that
i
ugh
but
luckily
he
did
notice
he
had
taken
my
hand
and
was
looking
at
me
over
his
spectacles
in
his
dear
fatherly
old
way
tell
me
now
my
dear
is
there
anything
that
an
old
clergyman
can
do
for
you
i
have
an
engagement
near
here
and
we
may
not
meet
again
i
ca
hope
to
find
you
in
my
carriage
many
more
times
you
are
happy
you
are
living
worthily
child
pardon
me
but
the
stage
oh
the
gentle
courtesy
of
his
manner
i
loved
his
solicitude
girls
like
us
maggie
know
how
to
value
a
thing
like
that
you
know
i
said
slowly
the
thing
that
keeps
a
woman
straight
and
a
man
faithful
is
not
a
matter
of
bricks
and
mortar
nor
ways
of
thinking
nor
habits
of
living
it
something
finer
and
stronger
than
these
it
the
magic
taboo
of
her
love
for
him
and
his
for
her
that
makes
them
sacred
with
that
to
guard
them
why
yes
yes
he
patted
my
hand
softly
still
the
old
see
the
dangers
of
an
environment
that
a
young
and
impulsive
woman
like
you
my
dear
might
be
blind
to
your
associates
my
associates
oh
you
heard
about
beryl
blackburn
well
she
she
just
beryl
you
know
she
was
made
to
live
any
different
some
people
steal
and
some
drink
and
some
gamble
and
some
well
beryl
belongs
to
the
last
class
she
does
pretend
to
be
better
than
she
is
and
just
between
you
and
me
bishop
i
more
respect
for
a
girl
of
that
kind
than
for
grace
weston
whose
husband
is
my
leading
man
you
know
why
she
pulls
the
wool
over
his
eyes
and
makes
him
the
of
the
company
i
ca
stand
her
any
more
than
i
can
marie
avon
who
never
without
two
strings
all
at
once
i
stopped
but
was
it
like
me
to
spoil
it
all
by
bubbling
over
i
tell
you
maggie
too
much
truth
is
good
for
the
bishop
set
they
do
know
how
to
digest
it
i
was
afraid
that
i
lost
him
for
he
spoke
with
a
stately
little
primness
as
the
carriage
just
then
came
to
a
stop
i
had
been
so
interested
talking
that
i
had
noticed
where
we
were
driving
ah
here
we
are
he
said
i
must
ask
you
to
excuse
me
miss
ah
that
is
there
a
public
meeting
of
the
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
children
this
afternoon
that
i
must
attend
then
oh
are
you
bound
for
the
cruelty
too
i
asked
why
so
am
i
and
yes
yes
that
the
cruelty
the
cruelty
stands
just
where
it
did
mag
when
you
and
i
first
saw
it
most
things
do
in
philadelphia
you
know
there
the
same
prim
official
straight
about
the
brick
front
the
steps
do
look
so
steep
now
and
the
building
not
so
high
perhaps
because
of
a
skyscraper
or
two
that
gone
up
since
but
it
chills
your
blood
maggie
darlin
just
as
it
always
did
to
think
what
it
stands
for
not
man
inhumanity
to
man
but
women
cruelty
to
children
maggie
think
of
it
if
you
can
as
though
this
were
the
first
time
you
heard
of
such
a
thing
would
you
believe
it
i
waked
from
that
to
find
myself
marching
up
the
stairs
behind
the
bishop
rigid
little
back
oh
it
was
stiff
and
uncompromising
beryl
blackburn
did
that
for
me
poor
pretty
pagan
beryl
my
coming
with
the
bishop
we
seemed
to
come
together
anyway
made
the
people
think
he
brought
me
so
i
must
be
just
all
right
i
had
the
man
bring
in
the
toys
i
got
out
in
the
carriage
and
i
handed
them
over
to
the
matron
saying
they
for
the
children
i
want
them
to
have
them
all
and
now
please
to
do
whatever
they
want
with
them
there
always
be
others
i
going
to
send
them
right
along
if
you
let
me
so
that
those
who
leave
can
take
something
of
their
very
own
with
them
something
that
never
belonged
to
anybody
else
but
just
themselves
you
understand
it
terrible
do
you
know
to
be
a
deserted
child
or
a
tortured
child
or
a
crippled
child
and
have
nothing
to
do
but
sit
up
in
that
bare
clean
little
room
upstairs
with
a
lot
of
other
strangelings
and
just
think
on
the
cruelty
that
brought
you
here
and
the
cruelty
you
may
get
into
when
you
leave
here
if
i
had
a
doll
if
mag
had
only
had
a
set
of
dishes
or
a
little
tin
kitchen
if
the
boy
with
the
gouged
eye
could
have
had
a
set
of
tools
oh
ca
you
understand
i
became
conscious
then
that
the
matron
a
new
one
mag
ours
is
gone
was
staring
at
me
and
that
the
people
stood
around
listening
as
though
i
gone
mad
who
came
to
my
rescue
why
the
bishop
like
the
manly
little
fellow
he
is
he
forgave
me
even
beryl
in
that
moment
it
nance
olden
ladies
he
said
with
a
dignified
little
wave
of
his
hand
that
served
for
an
introduction
she
begins
her
philadelphia
engagement
in
and
the
greatest
of
these
oh
i
used
to
it
now
maggie
but
i
do
like
it
all
the
buzzed
about
me
and
there
nance
stood
preening
herself
and
crowing
softly
till
till
from
among
the
bunch
of
millinery
one
of
them
stepped
up
to
me
she
had
a
big
smooth
face
with
plenty
of
chins
her
hair
was
white
and
her
nose
was
curved
and
she
rustled
in
silk
and
it
was
dowager
diamonds
alias
henrietta
alias
edward
ramsay
clever
my
how
clever
she
exclaimed
as
though
the
sob
in
my
voice
that
i
could
control
had
been
a
bit
of
acting
she
was
feeling
for
her
glasses
when
she
got
them
and
hooked
them
on
her
nose
and
got
a
good
look
at
me
why
she
just
dropped
them
with
a
smash
upon
the
desk
i
looked
for
a
minute
from
her
to
the
bishop
i
remember
you
very
well
ramsay
i
hope
you
have
forgotten
me
i
often
wanted
to
thank
you
for
your
kindness
i
said
slowly
while
she
as
slowly
recovered
i
think
you
be
glad
to
know
that
i
am
thoroughly
shall
i
tell
ramsay
how
bishop
i
put
it
square
up
to
him
and
he
met
it
like
the
little
man
he
is
perhaps
too
my
bit
of
charity
to
the
cruelty
children
had
pleased
him
i
do
think
it
will
be
necessary
miss
olden
he
said
gently
i
can
do
that
for
you
at
some
future
time
and
i
could
have
hugged
him
but
i
did
dare
we
had
tea
there
in
the
board
rooms
oh
mag
remember
how
we
used
to
peep
into
those
awful
imposing
board
rooms
remember
how
strange
and
resentful
you
felt
like
a
poor
little
nigger
up
at
the
block
when
you
were
brought
in
there
to
be
shown
to
the
woman
called
to
adopt
you
it
was
all
so
strange
that
i
had
to
keep
talking
to
keep
from
dreaming
i
was
talking
away
to
the
matron
and
the
bishop
about
the
going
to
fit
up
out
of
that
bare
little
place
upstairs
perhaps
the
same
child
does
stay
there
very
long
but
there
always
be
children
to
fill
it
more
the
cruel
pity
then
the
bishop
and
i
climbed
up
there
to
see
it
and
plan
about
it
but
i
could
really
see
it
mag
nor
the
poor
little
waifs
that
have
succeeded
us
for
the
tears
in
my
eyes
and
the
ache
at
my
heart
and
the
queer
trick
the
place
has
of
being
peopled
with
you
and
me
and
the
boy
with
the
gouged
eye
and
the
cripple
and
the
rest
he
put
his
gentle
thin
old
arm
about
my
shoulders
for
a
moment
when
he
saw
what
was
the
matter
with
me
oh
he
understands
my
bishop
and
then
we
turned
to
go
downstairs
oh
i
want
i
want
to
do
something
for
them
i
cried
i
want
to
do
something
that
counts
that
got
a
heart
in
it
that
knows
you
knew
did
you
it
was
true
what
i
said
downstairs
i
was
i
am
a
cruelty
girl
help
me
to
help
others
like
me
my
dear
he
said
very
stately
and
sweet
i
be
proud
to
be
your
assistant
you
a
kind
true
heart
and
and
just
at
that
minute
as
i
was
preceding
him
down
the
narrow
steps
a
girl
in
a
red
coat
trimmed
with
chinchilla
and
in
a
red
toque
with
some
of
the
same
fur
blocked
our
way
as
she
was
coming
up
we
looked
at
each
other
you
seen
two
peacocks
spread
their
tails
and
strut
as
they
pass
each
other
well
the
peacock
coming
up
in
it
with
the
one
going
down
her
coat
was
so
fine
nor
so
heavy
nor
so
newly
smartly
cut
her
toque
was
so
big
nor
so
saucy
and
the
fur
on
it
not
to
mention
that
the
descending
peacock
was
a
brunette
and
well
mag
i
had
my
day
miss
evelyn
kingdon
paid
me
back
in
that
minute
for
all
the
envy
i
spent
on
that
pretty
rig
of
hers
she
did
recognize
me
of
course
even
though
the
two
red
coats
were
so
near
as
she
stopped
to
let
me
pass
that
they
kissed
like
sisters
ere
they
parted
but
mag
nancy
olden
never
got
haughty
that
there
was
a
fall
waiting
for
her
back
of
miss
kingdon
stood
kingdon
still
kingdon
thanks
to
nance
olden
and
behind
her
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
was
a
frail
little
bundle
of
black
satin
and
old
lace
i
lost
my
breath
when
the
bishop
hailed
his
wife
maria
he
said
some
men
say
their
wives
first
names
all
the
years
of
their
lives
as
they
said
them
on
their
i
want
you
to
meet
miss
olden
nance
olden
the
comedian
she
the
girl
i
wanted
for
my
daughter
you
remember
it
more
than
a
year
ago
now
since
i
began
to
talk
about
her
i
held
my
breath
while
i
waited
for
her
answer
but
her
poor
eyes
rested
on
my
hot
face
without
a
sign
it
an
old
joke
among
us
she
said
pleasantly
about
the
daughter
we
stood
there
and
chatted
and
the
bishop
turned
away
to
speak
to
kingdon
then
i
seized
my
chance
i
heard
van
wagenen
i
said
softly
and
oh
as
nicely
as
i
could
of
your
fondness
for
lace
we
are
going
abroad
in
the
spring
my
husband
and
i
to
malta
among
other
places
ca
i
get
you
a
piece
there
as
a
souvenir
of
the
bishop
kindness
to
me
her
little
hands
clasped
and
unclasped
with
an
almost
childish
eagerness
oh
thank
you
thank
you
very
much
but
if
you
would
give
the
same
sum
to
charity
i
will
i
laughed
she
could
guess
how
glad
i
was
to
do
this
thing
and
i
spend
just
as
much
on
your
lace
and
be
so
happy
if
you
accept
it
i
promised
henrietta
a
box
for
maggie
and
one
to
kingdon
the
dowager
told
me
she
love
to
come
though
her
husband
is
out
of
town
unfortunately
she
said
but
you
come
with
me
wo
you
bishop
she
said
turning
to
him
and
you
mrs
van
the
bishop
blushed
was
he
thinking
of
beryl
i
wonder
but
i
hear
his
answer
for
it
was
at
that
moment
that
i
caught
fred
voice
he
had
told
me
he
was
going
to
call
for
me
i
think
he
fancied
that
the
old
cruelty
would
depress
me
as
dreams
of
it
have
you
know
and
he
wanted
to
come
and
carry
me
away
from
it
just
as
at
night
when
i
waked
shivering
and
moaning
i
felt
his
dear
arms
lifting
me
out
of
the
black
of
it
but
it
was
anything
but
a
doleful
nance
he
found
and
hurried
down
the
snowy
steps
out
to
a
hansom
and
off
to
rehearsal
for
the
bishop
had
said
to
me
god
bless
you
child
when
he
