preface
a
few
years
ago
the
readers
of
wee
willie
winkie
detected
a
new
vein
running
through
the
editorial
notes
and
announcements
which
prefaced
the
monthly
collection
of
juvenile
literary
efforts
which
made
up
their
little
magazine
there
was
an
originality
and
a
humour
which
they
had
not
noticed
before
and
competitions
were
suggested
to
them
of
a
type
for
a
repetition
of
which
they
clamoured
and
then
presently
a
new
serial
story
began
and
the
hairbreadth
escapes
of
that
immortal
monkey
which
it
recorded
were
breathlessly
followed
by
wee
willie
winkie
army
of
bairns
all
over
the
world
and
when
it
was
concluded
so
numerous
were
the
entreaties
for
a
sequel
that
compulsion
had
to
be
resorted
to
in
order
to
secure
the
revelation
of
the
later
life
of
the
hero
under
a
new
name
and
now
at
last
the
editors
who
were
responsible
for
the
periodical
referred
to
have
to
make
a
confession
once
upon
a
time
they
both
mother
and
daughter
forsook
their
office
and
went
away
to
canada
for
several
months
in
and
during
that
time
their
joint
editorial
chair
was
occupied
by
no
other
than
professor
henry
drummond
and
now
our
readers
will
understand
to
whom
they
are
indebted
for
the
quaint
sayings
and
funny
stories
and
competitions
betokening
someone
who
understood
boys
and
girls
too
and
they
will
be
grateful
to
a
certain
contributor
who
failed
to
send
his
copy
in
time
for
the
monthly
issue
on
one
occasion
and
so
forced
the
then
editor
to
sit
down
and
write
something
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
tried
to
write
fiction
and
as
the
story
grew
under
his
pen
he
began
to
realise
the
joy
of
creation
and
so
it
was
that
in
spite
of
his
playful
deprecation
of
such
nonsense
being
printed
the
adventures
of
the
monkey
that
would
not
kill
came
to
be
told
and
we
know
that
we
can
do
our
old
friends
and
readers
no
greater
kindness
than
to
dedicate
these
chronicles
to
them
in
permanent
form
in
memory
of
one
to
whom
wee
willie
and
his
bairns
were
ever
a
subject
of
affectionate
interest

a
monkey
business
in
the
world
is
usually
to
make
everybody
merry
but
the
special
mission
of
this
one
i
fear
was
to
make
everybody
as
angry
as
ever
they
could
be
in
power
in
fact
this
monkey
positively
shone
how
many
escapes
the
monkey
had
before
the
slave
presented
it
to
the
missionary
from
whom
i
first
heard
of
it
no
one
knows
it
certainly
had
not
much
hair
on
when
it
arrived
and
there
was
an
ominous
scar
on
its
head
and
its
ears
were
not
wholly
symmetrical
but
the
children
were
vastly
delighted
with
it
and
after
much
kind
treatment
the
creature
was
restored
to
rude
health
and
i
must
confess
to
quite
too
rude
spirits
the
children
wanted
him
baptized
by
the
title
of
but
by
a
series
of
exploits
in
which
the
monkey
distinguished
himself
at
the
expense
of
every
member
of
the
household
in
turn
it
became
evident
that
only
one
name
would
fit
a
quadruped
of
his
peculiar
disposition
and
that
was
tricky
therefore
he
was
called
and
as
tricky
he
lived
and
did
die

there
was

in

came
he
ate

everything
broke
everything
stole
everything
did

that
the
average
monkey
ought
not
to
do

they
shut

room
tricky

if
they
put
him
out
of

room
tricky
came
in
by
the
chimney
what
could
you
do
with
such
a
creature
he
could
not
be
kept
in
and
he
could
not
be
kept
out
so
a
was
held
and
tricky
was
sentenced
to
be
given
away
but
by
this
time
the
whole
place
knew
tricky
and
no
one
would
have
him
such
an
unusual
refusal
of
a
present
was
never
known
before
even
the
slave
smiled
sweetly
when
his
old
friend
was
offered
to
him
and
protested
that
to
his
deep
regret
he
was
unable
to
buy
nuts
enough
to
keep
him
the
idea
of
tricky
in
the
woods
of
course
occurred
to
the
genius
of
the
village
and
a
detachment
of
boys
set
off
one
saturday
to
carry
it
into
effect
but
you
might
as
well
have
tried
to
wander

carrier

like
mary
little
lamb
everywhere
these
boys
went
that
monkey
went
when
they
ran
it
ran
when
they
doubled
back
it
doubled
back
and
when
they
got
home
dead
tired
it
was
only
to
find
tricky
laughing
at
them
from
the
church
roof
that
night
the
worst
happened
when
the
people
assembled
for
the
weekly
meeting
there
was
not
found
in
that
church
one
whole
some
one
apparently
had
been
pelting
the
pulpit
with
them
the
cushions
were
torn
the
blinds
were
a
wreck
two
stops
in
the
harmonium
were
pulled
out
bodily
after
the
service
the
missionary
was
solemnly
waited
on
by
a
deputation
they
were
closeted
for
an
hour
and
a
half
but
no
one
except
themselves
ever
knew
what
was
said
or
done
the
only
circumstances
that
one
could
in
any
way
connect
with
this
mysterious
council
was
that
about
midnight
a
small
boat
was
seen
stealthily
putting
out
to
sea
it
contained
two
figures
one
who
rowed
was
the
senior
elder
the
other
who
sat
in
the
stern

chapter
ii
the
day
was
not
yet
broken
when
the
of
the
ship
lying
becalmed
off
the
coast
was
roused
by
a
peculiar
noise
aft
going
to
the
spot
he
was
surprised
to
find
a
monkey
rubbing
itself
on
a
pile
of
the
creature
had
evidently
swum
or
drifted
a
long
distance
and
was
now
endeavouring
to
restore
circulation
jerry
being
a
humane
man
got
it
some
biscuit
and
a
saucer
of
grog
and
waited
developments
these
were
not
slow
to
show
themselves
within
hours
the
commander
of
the
ship
tons
register
was
a
monkey
named
tricky
time
would
fail
me
to
tell
of
the
life
that
monkey
led
them
all
on
board
the
after
the
first
week
only
two
things
lay
between
him
and
death
at
any
moment
one
was
his
inventiveness
tricky
wickedness
was
nothing
if
not
original
every
day
he
was
at
some
new
villainy
and
anything
on
board
ship
is
sacred
there
is
no
published
on
board
ship
but
tricky
was
all
the
comic
papers
rolled
into
one
but
that
was
not
the
main
reason
there
is
a
good
deal
of
quiet
quarrelling
on
board
ship
the
mate
spared
tricky
because
he
thought
he
would
some
day
give
the
captain
a
the
captain
let
him
live
hoping
he
would
do
something
dreadful
to
the
mate
everybody
waited
to
see
tricky
do
something
to
somebody
else
so
he
rose
to
the
highest
rank
in
the
and
was
respected
almost
to
idolatry
by
all
on
board
the
one
day
tricky
was
hanged
formally
deliberately
and
judicially
hanged
what
had
he
done
he
had
killed
the
ship
cat
it
was
a
deliberate
murder
with
no
extenuating
circumstances
and
a
rope
with
a
noose
was
swung
over
the
and
tricky
run
up
in
the
presence
of
all
the
crew
this
happened
about
eight
bells
and
at
dusk
tricky
was
still
hanging
there
very
quiet
and
motionless
next
morning
tricky
was
still
there
as
live
as
you
are
tricky
was
not
hanged
he
was
only
hanging
and
as
everybody
knows
monkeys
rather
like
hanging
in
fact
though
tricky
was
still
up
there
he
had
got
his
hands
well
round
the
rope
and
was
on
the
whole
fairly
at
home
the
rope
round
a
neck
like
tricky
was
a
mere
boa
illustration
next
morning
tricky
was
still
there
the
executioners
were
rather
ashamed
of
themselves
when
they
saw
how
matters
stood
but
instead
of
softening
them
this
dangling
mockery
of
a
dead
monkey
still
further
roused
their
wrath
and
the
boatswain
was
told
off
to
end
the
drama
by
tossing
tricky
into
the
sea
the
boatswain
was
up
the
shrouds
in
a
moment
and
loosening
the
rope
with
one
hand
and
catching
the
monkey
by
the
tail
with
the
other
he
swung
poor
tricky
a
good
yard
over
the
ship
side
into
the
atlantic
when
the
boatswain
descended
upon
the
deck
he
was
greeted
with
a
sudden
deluge
of
rain
it
was
only
tricky
shaking
the
off
the
monkey
had
climbed
up
the
stern
rope
and
reached
the
deck
before
him
what
would
have
happened
next
is
hard
to
predict
but
at
this
point
the
captain
attracted
by
the
scream
of
laughter
which
greeted
the
drenching
of
the
boatswain
came
up
and
was
told
the
sequel
to
the
hanging
now
the
captain
was
a
blunt
man
and
he
avowed
that
neither
man
nor
monkey
who
had
ever
been
hanged
on
board
his
ship
should
ever
be
put
to
death
again
this
was
the
law
on
shore
he
said
and
he
would
see
so
tricky
received
another
lease
of
life
and
thus
the
ship
was
kept
in
hot
water
for
two
months
more
illustration
it
was
only
tricky
shaking
the
off
about
the
end
of
that
period
there
came
a
crisis
the
ship
was
nearing
port
and
a
heavy
cleaning
was
in
progress
among
other
things
the
ship
boats
had
to
be
painted
in
an
evil
hour
one
of
the
men
went
below
to
dinner
and
left
his
standing
on
the
deck
if
tricky
had
lost
such
a
chance
he
would
not
have
been
a
monkey
at
all
needless
to
say
he
rose
to
the
occasion
that
his
supreme
hour
was
come
was
quite
evident
from
the
way
he
set
to
work
at
once
he
began
with
the
parrot
which
he
painted
vermilion
then
he
passed
the
brush
gaily
along
the
newly
varnished
daubed
the
masts
and
shrouds
all
over
obliterated
the
name
on
the
and
wound
up
a
somewhat
successful
performance
by
emptying
the
pot
over
the
captain
best
coat
which
was
laid
in
the
sun
to
get
the
creases
out
i
draw
a
veil
over
what
happened
on
the
during
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
there
was
never
such
a
muster
of
the
crew
since
they
left
port
everybody
seemed
to
have
business
on
deck
when
the
captain
came
up
you
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
i
shall
not
repeat
his
language
nor
try
to
compare
with
anything
earthly
the
voice
with
which
he
ordered
every
man
below
all
i
will
record
is
and
it
is
to
his
everlasting
honour
that
in
that
awful
hour
the
captain
was
true
to
his
vow
you
see
land
he
roared
to
the
steersman
aye
sir
said
the
man
on
the
larboard
bow
said
the
captain
her
head
to
it
illustration
he
began
with
the
parrot
that
night
late
the
ship
stood
close
in
to
a
small
island
on
the
north
coast
of
scotland
and
a
boat
was
solemnly
sent
ashore
and
after
that
tricky
was
no
more
seen
by
any
of
the
crew
of
the
chapter
iii
the
island
on
which
the
captain
of
the
exiled
tricky
was
marked
on
the
chart
but
the
chart
was
wrong
ten
years
before
a
shepherd
had
come
there
and
now
lived
with
his
wife
and
family
near
the
top
of
the
great
you
may
judge
of
the
sensation
when
a
real
live
monkey
appeared
in
the
early
morning
in
this
remote
and
lonely
spot
the
shepherd
was
watching
his
sheep
when
the
apparition
rose
as
it
were
from
the
ground
he
had
never
seen
a
monkey
before
any
more
than
the
sheep
and
sheep
and
shepherd
bolted
like
wildfire
tricky
of
course
followed
the
biped
for
he
had
always
been
accustomed
to
human
society
and
as
the
shepherd
fled
towards
the
hut
he
saw
the
monkey
close
at
his
heels
so
he
made
a
rush
at
the
open
door
and
pulled
it
after
him
with
a
bang
which
almost
brought
down
the
house
illustration
the
shepherd
bolted
like
wildfire
the
fugitive
had
just
got
inside
when
in
a
moment
he
felt
himself
seized
from
behind
it
seemed
as
if
a
powerful
hand
was
dragging
him
backward
and
he
threw
himself
down
on
the
ground
and
roared
with
fear
what
had
happened
was
that
the
flying
end
of
his
plaid
had
got
jammed
in
the
door
but
he
felt
sure
the
evil
spirit
was
holding
him
in
its
clutches
and
it
was
some
time
before
his
startled
wife
could
convince
him
that
there
was
nothing
there
the
good
woman
gathered
him
up
and
soothed
him
and
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
he
told
her
in
a
shivering
voice
about
the
awful
monster
which
had
come
to
slay
them
all
he
had
scarcely
got
out
the
word
when
there
was
a
scurrying
in
the
chimney
and
the
monster
presented
himself
before
them
and
calmly
sat
down
on
the
just
a
puggy
cried
the
shepherd
wife
she
had
been
to
inverness
and
began
to
stroke
tricky
on
the
back
as
she
did
so
she
noticed
that
the
creature
had
a
strand
of
an
old
rope
round
its
neck
and
to
this
was
attached
a
small
piece
of
paper
she
opened
it
and
read
four
words
scrawled
in
a
hasty
hand
hang
wo
drown
the
shepherd
seemed
more
frightened
than
ever
at
this
revelation
hang
wo
drown
he
muttered
we
see
if
it
wo
and
he
reached
over
the
fireplace
for
the
gun
which
he
killed
the
rabbits
with
as
he
loaded
it
it
seemed
to
the
shepherd
wife
as
if
all
the
powder
and
shot
in
the
house
was
being
poured
into
the
barrel
she
pleaded
with
her
husband
to
spare
tricky
life
and
it
almost
looked
as
if
she
had
succeeded
for
the
shepherd
lowered
the
gun
from
his
shoulder
and
stood
for
a
moment
as
if
in
doubt
but
it
was
not
because
of
his
wife
he
stopped
it
was
partly
because
he
was
quite
too
shaky
to
aim
straight
and
partly
because
he
was
too
much
of
a
sportsman
to
shoot
offhand
a
thing
which
was
sitting
quiet
and
still
on
his
own
but
the
main
reason
was
that
he
was
afraid
to
shoot
the
baby
whose
crib
was
just
beside
it
so
he
gave
the
a
kick
with
his
foot
to
dislodge
the
monkey
he
thought
it
would
make
for
the
door
and
there
in
the
open
air
he
would
shoot
it
fair
and
square
but
the
monkey
had
other
views
what
it
wanted
was
something
to
eat
and
the
children
porridge
being
handy
it
put
its
paw
in
and
began
breakfast
the
shepherd
was
too
much
petrified
to
interfere
and
it
was
only
when
tricky
next
spilt
the
over
the
baby
that
he
roused
himself
to
do
his
duty
to
his
family
he
raised
the
gun
once
more
and
watching
his
chance
when
tricky
was
exactly
opposite
the
door
aimed
straight
at
its
heart
and
pulled
the
trigger
now
the
next
moment
that
monkey
ought
to
have
been
scattered
all
over
the
hillside
in
multitudinous
fragments
on
the
contrary
it
was
up
on
the
table
imitating
the
click
of
the
gun
with
a
spoon
not
that
the
shepherd
missed
for
the
first
time
in
its
life
the
rusty
lock
had
and
the
dazed
shepherd
was
more
than
ever
confirmed
in
his
belief
that
the
monkey
was
a
witch
shoot
he
muttered
to
himself
hang
wo
drown
i
have
tried
the
first
i
prove
the
next
so
as
he
was
too
superstitious
to
try
to
shoot
it
again
he
went
out
to
hang
the
monkey
but
there
was
no
tree
on
the
island
all
day
the
shepherd
searched
for
a
place
to
hang
tricky
but
in
vain
that
night
he
lay
thinking
hour
after
hour
where
he
would
hang
it
and
in
the
early
morning
an
inspiration
came
to
him
he
would
try
the
pump
so
he
rose
softly
and
fixed
the
handle
of
the
pump
high
in
the
air
so
that
it
stuck
out
like
a
gallows
and
tied
a
rope
with
a
noose
to
the
end
of
it
then
he
got
tricky
to
perch
on
the
top
of
the
pump
tied
the
rope
round
his
neck
and
all
was
ready
the
shepherd
had
heard
that
the
object
of
hanging
was
to
break
the
neck
of
the
criminal
by
a
sudden
but
as
he
could
not
give
tricky
a
long
enough
drop
he
determined
to
make
up
for
it
in
another
way
so
he
gathered
all
his
strength
and
with
a
tremendous
sweep
of
his
arms
sent
tricky
flying
into
space
of
course
you
know
what
happened
the
rope
it
was
quite
rotten
broke
and
tricky
landed
on
his
four
paws
and
stood
grinning
at
his
executioner
as
if
he
would
like
it
all
over
again
illustration
all
was
ready
that
whole
day
the
sheep
and
lambs
on
the
island
of
were
neglected
all
day
long
you
might
have
seen
the
shepherd
sitting
by
the
plaiting
something
with
his
fingers
round
him
the
ground
was
strewn
with
rushes
some
loose
and
some
in
bundles
but
for
every
one
the
workman
chose
he
threw
away
a
hundred
because
it
was
not
tough
and
strong
and
as
he
plaited
and
twisted
and
knotted
and
tested
there
was
fire
in
the
shepherd
eye
and
thunder
all
over
his
face
at
daybreak
next
morning
the
shepherd
and
the
monkey
once
more
formed
in
procession
and
wended
their
way
to
the
old
pump
the
new
rope
could
hang
an
elephant
it
was
thick
as
a
and
the
shepherd
took
a
full
hour
to
adjust
the
noose
and
get
the
gallows
into
working
order
then
the
fatal
moment
came
with
a
mightier
shove
than
before
the
monkey
was
launched
into
the
air
and
the
rope
stiffened
and
held
like
a
hawser
but
the
executioner
had
not
calculated
everything
the
rope
and
the
were
all
right
but
when
the
gallows
felt
the
shock
the
cracked
off
like
a
match
and
the
old
tube
gave
two
rocks
and
reeled
from
its
moorings
and
lay
split
in
pieces
on
the
ground
jagged
and
needlelike
splinters
at
the
same
moment
scraped
and
pierced
and
gouged
at
the
shepherd
shins
and
tore
his
nether
garments
and
made
him
dance
with
pain
and
rage
if
anything
could
have
added
more
agony
to
the
next
few
minutes
it
was
the
sight
of
tricky
that
ever
gay
animal
was
careering
down
the
hill
straight
towards
the
feeding
sheep
the
was
still
tied
to
its
neck
and
it
clattered
over
the
stones
with
a
noise
weird
enough
to
drive
the
whole
flock
into
the
sea
the
shepherd
knew
there
must
be
a
catastrophe
but
he
was
powerless
to
avert
it
he
was
too
sore
to
follow
so
he
slowly
limped
towards
the
hut
to
nurse
his
wrath
and
his
wounds
chapter
iv
for
three
days
after
the
monkey
had
been
it
did
not
come
near
the
shepherd
or
his
house
a
monkey
has
feelings
to
be
nearly
hanged
is
bad
enough
but
to
have
a
and
a
tied
to
your
neck
is
more
than
any
animal
would
stand
so
tricky
devoted
himself
exclusively
to
the
sheep
for
the
space
of
three
days
with
the
invaluable
aid
of
the
tricky
shepherded
that
flock
not
a
blade
of
grass
was
nibbled
during
this
period
one
prolonged
stampede
was
kept
up
night
and
day
the
lambs
dropped
with
hunger
the
old
sheep
tottered
with
fatigue
the
whole
flock
was
demoralised
in
fact
when
the
of
terror
closed
there
was
not
a
pound
of
sound
mutton
left
on
the
island
why
did
not
the
shepherd
interfere
because
as
we
shall
see
for
these
three
days
he
had
more
urgent
work
to
do
when
the
shepherd
wife
went
out
to
the
pump
that
morning
for
water
to
make
the
porridge
with
she
found
it
a
heap
of
ruins
she
came
back
and
broke
the
tidings
to
the
shepherd
and
said
she
believed
it
had
been
struck
with
lightning
the
shepherd
discreetly
said
nothing
but
presently
stole
sullenly
out
to
inspect
the
damage
once
more
it
was
worse
than
he
thought
a
pump
must
hold
in
both
air
and
water
this
pump
was
rent
and
split
in
a
dozen
places
there
was
no
water
either
to
drink
or
make
the
porridge
with
till
the
tube
was
mended
so
all
that
day
the
shepherd
was
splicing
and
hammering
and
gluing
and
bandaging
all
the
next
day
he
was
doing
the
same
he
got
nothing
to
eat
or
drink
nobody
got
anything
to
eat
or
drink
the
poor
children
were
kept
alive
on
a
single
bowlful
which
happened
to
be
in
the
house
but
this
was
now
finished
and
they
were
crying
out
from
want
positively
if
this
drought
and
famine
had
been
kept
up
for
a
few
days
more
the
island
would
certainly
have
been
restored
to
the
condition
described
on
the
chart
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
the
pump
stood
erect
and
wind
and
once
more
only
one
thing
was
wanting
there
was
no
handle
the
only
thing
left
was
to
try
to
catch
tricky
for
there
was
nothing
else
on
the
island
which
would
make
a
handle
but
just
then
tricky
required
no
catching
at
that
moment
he
was
sitting
on
the
doorstep
contemplating
the
group
round
the
pump
everybody
being
out
he
had
seized
the
opportunity
to
have
a
good
breakfast
consisting
of
every
particle
of
meal
in
the
barrel
and
was
now
enjoying
a
period
of
repose
before
recommencing
hostilities
the
shepherd
made
a
rush
at
him
but
alas
what
he
wanted
was
no
longer
there
a
piece
of
frayed
rope
dangled
on
its
neck
but
the
was
gone
it
took
two
days
more
to
find
it
every
inch
of
the
island
was
patiently
examined
even
the
child
next
the
baby
had
to
join
in
the
search
night
and
day
they
were
all
at
it
and
at
last
it
was
found
by
the
wife
stuck
in
a
all
this
time
no
one
had
leisure
to
kill
tricky
but
on
the
seventh
day
the
shepherd
rose
with
murder
written
on
his
brow
the
monkey
would
not
shoot
and
he
would
not
hang
it
remained
to
try
what
drowning
would
do
so
he
tied
a
large
stone
round
the
monkey
neck
and
led
him
forth
to
the
edge
of
the
great
illustration
he
took
monkey
and
stone
and
heaved
them
over
the
cliff
a
hundred
feet
below
the
sea
lay
like
a
mirror
and
the
shepherd
as
he
looked
over
for
a
deep
place
saw
the
great
fronds
of
the
and
the
and
the
anemones
lying
motionless
in
the
crystal
waters
then
he
took
the
monkey
and
the
stone
in
his
great
hands
examined
the
knots
hastily
and
with
one
sudden
swing
heaved
them
over
the
cliff
the
shepherd
would
much
rather
at
this
point
have
retired
from
the
scene
but
he
dared
not
he
could
not
trust
that
monkey
an
actual
certificate
of
death
was
due
to
himself
and
to
his
family
so
he
peered
over
the
cliff
and
saw
the
splash
in
the
sea
and
watched
the
ripples
clearing
off
till
the
stood
out
again
with
every
shell
distinct
and
there
sure
enough
was
tricky
down
among
the
safely
moored
to
his
gravestone
and
the
yard
of
good
rope
holding
like
a
the
shepherd
rose
for
the
first
time
since
that
monkey
set
foot
upon
the
island
and
breathed
freely
then
he
slowly
went
back
to
the
house
and
told
the
tale
of
the
end
of
tricky
it
was
not
till
midnight
that
tricky
came
back
of
course
you
knew
tricky
would
come
back
you
knew
the
rope
would
slip
over
the
stone
or
break
or
be
eaten
through
by
a
great
fish
or
something
and
though
none
of
these
things
happened
it
is
certainly
true
that
that
night
at
midnight
tricky
did
turn
up
perhaps
i
should
say
turn
down
for
he
came
in
as
usual
by
the
chimney
but
the
exact
way
in
which
this
singular
creature
escaped
from
its
watery
grave
must
be
reserved
for
another
chapter
chapter
v
if
the
shepherd
had
stood
looking
over
the
cliff
for
one
moment
longer
he
would
have
witnessed
a
curious
scene
every
schoolboy
knows
that
a
stone
is
lighter
in
water
than
in
air
how
the
monkey
knew
this
or
whether
he
did
or
did
not
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
his
actions
were
certainly
those
of
a
philosopher
for
instead
of
resigning
himself
to
his
fate
he
bent
down
and
grasped
the
stone
which
held
him
to
his
watery
grave
picked
it
up
in
his
arms
and
walked
calmly
along
the
bottom
towards
the
shore
with
a
supreme
effort
he
next
got
the
stone
edged
on
to
a
ledge
but
now
that
it
was
half
out
of
the
water
it
was
once
more
too
heavy
to
lift
and
tricky
lay
in
great
perplexity
in
the
shallow
water
wondering
how
ever
he
was
to
get
out
of
this
fresh
dilemma
there
appeared
nothing
for
it
but
to
attack
the
rope
with
his
teeth
and
for
an
hour
tricky
worked
at
the
tough
strands
but
without
almost
any
success
after
another
hour
work
the
monkey
made
an
appalling
discovery
when
he
began
work
the
water
was
only
up
to
his
knees
and
to
his
consternation
it
now
covered
him
up
to
his
middle
in
a
short
time
more
it
came
up
to
his
neck
and
it
was
clear
to
tricky
that
if
the
ledge
went
on
sinking
at
this
rate
he
was
a
dead
monkey
tricky
thought
he
knew
all
about
the
sea
but
in
the
foreign
sea
where
he
had
lived
with
the
missionary
there
were
no
tides
and
this
creeping
in
of
the
water
greatly
disturbed
his
peace
of
mind
to
his
great
joy
however
he
found
that
the
stone
now
wholly
covered
with
water
was
once
more
light
enough
to
lift
and
he
trundled
it
along
the
ledge
till
the
water
became
too
shallow
to
move
it
further
just
above
this
point
was
another
ledge
high
and
dry
above
and
the
yard
of
rope
was
just
long
enough
to
allow
the
monkey
to
take
up
his
position
there
and
shake
himself
dry
in
the
sun
now
this
shaking
process
suggested
an
idea
to
tricky
a
very
obvious
one
to
you
or
me
but
a
real
inspiration
to
a
monkey
tricky
noticed
that
the
very
part
of
the
rope
where
he
had
been
gnawing
rested
against
the
sharp
edge
of
the
rocky
ledge
and
that
one
frayed
strand
had
suddenly
parted
while
he
was
shaking
himself
the
in
fact
was
a
regular
knife
and
after
much
and
hard
rubbing
and
many
rests
tricky
found
himself
within
three
or
four
strands
of
freedom
it
was
all
but
midnight
when
the
last
strand
parted
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
the
gallant
monkey
crawled
up
the
cliff
and
stood
once
more
at
the
door
of
his
executioner
house
i
am
afraid
you
will
be
as
much
surprised
as
tricky
was
at
the
startling
discovery
he
made
when
he
got
there
the
cottage
was
on
fire
for
days
you
will
remember
there
had
been
no
food
in
the
shepherd
home
but
that
day
the
family
had
celebrated
the
mending
of
the
pump
by
a
great
banquet
and
a
washing
such
a
fire
was
lit
as
had
not
blazed
on
the
hearth
for
years
and
when
it
grew
dark
the
red
sparks
flew
into
the
air
and
fell
in
dangerous
showers
upon
the
dry
thatched
roof
the
wind
too
rose
about
nightfall
and
fanned
one
smouldering
square
of
turf
into
life
and
when
tricky
reached
the
spot
at
least
half
the
roof
was
already
in
a
blaze
but
tricky
was
hungry
after
his
day
adventures
and
the
chimney
end
of
the
roof
being
still
untouched
by
the
fire
he
jumped
on
to
the
roof
and
down
into
the
kitchen
with
a
bound
the
cradle
lay
as
usual
close
to
the
side
of
the
fire
and
the
monkey
in
passing
must
have
swished
it
with
his
tail
for
the
infant
broke
into
a
sudden
yell
which
rang
through
the
room
and
woke
the
shepherd
with
a
start
the
good
man
was
awake
not
a
moment
too
soon
had
the
monkey
arrived
five
minutes
later
the
whole
family
must
have
perished
the
smoke
had
already
filled
the
other
room
and
was
pouring
in
in
rolling
clouds
below
the
kitchen
door
with
one
thunderstruck
glare
at
the
who
had
wakened
him
so
opportunely
and
who
now
occupied
his
usual
throne
on
the
violently
sneezing
out
smoke
and
wondering
whether
it
was
not
better
to
be
drowned
the
shepherd
rushed
towards
the
door
to
save
the
two
elder
children
who
lay
locked
in
slumber
in
the
burning
room
beyond
seizing
them
in
his
arms
he
bore
them
safely
to
the
open
air
and
then
returned
for
his
wife
and
the
other
children
tricky
followed
at
their
heels
and
the
next
moment
the
rescued
family
stood
in
a
shivering
group
helplessly
watching
the
flames
the
roof
soon
fell
in
and
in
the
morning
all
that
remained
of
the
shepherd
house
was
a
few
charred
rafters
on
the
spot
where
the
shepherd
cottage
was
burned
now
stands
a
noble
lighthouse
it
was
put
up
a
few
months
after
the
fire
and
one
of
the
three
is
the
shepherd
the
second
is
a
man
who
is
fond
of
telling
tales
of
the
sea
and
how
he
was
once
mate
of
a
ship
called
the
the
third
keeper
of
the
lighthouse
is
a
quadruped
called
tricky
the
affection
between
him
and
the
is
peculiar
other
people
think
there
is
some
history
connected
with
it
but
the
shepherd
never
says
much
when
asked
if
it
is
really
true
that
the
monkey
can
not
be
killed
he
always
replies
but
that
is
not
why
it
is
alive
only
on
one
occasion
was
the
shepherd
known
to
add
anything
to
that
remark
it
was
one
night
when
tricky
had
held
back
the
baby
it
had
just
learned
to
creep
from
tumbling
over
the
cliff
then
the
shepherd
smiled
as
he
threw
tricky
a
whole
bagful
of
nuts
and
said
monkey
wo
kill
nor
let
anybody
else
kill

tricky

chapter
i
i
suppose
you
thought
the
monkey
i
told
you
about
before
was
dead
but
my
opinion
is
that
he
is
still
alive
at
least
i
am
pretty
sure
it
is
the
same
monkey
that
i
have
now
to
tell
you
about
though
i
can
not
be
quite
sure
in
the
first
place
this
new
monkey
was
very
like
tricky
and
in
the
second
place
it
was
a
monkey
that
not
now
i
never
heard
before
of
any
monkey
that
would
not
kill
except
one
and
that
was
tricky
another
thing
that
makes
me
think
it
is
the
same
monkey
is
that
tricky
disappeared
from
the
island
where
we
saw
him
last
no
one
knows
how
it
happened
but
there
was
a
coincidence
about
the
time
which
i
must
relate
one
morning
a
boat
crew
landed
on
the
island
where

to

their
the
was
kind
to
them
for
they
were
foreigners
and
showed
them
all
over
the
lighthouse
and
when
they
got
to
the
very
top
they
found
the
monkey
dusting
the
lamps
just
like
a
human
being
the
sailors
were
much
astonished
and
one
of
them
who
could
speak
a
little
english
wanted
to
buy
tricky
for
two
pounds
when
the
heard
this
he
was
very
angry
and
ordered
them
all
down
the
ladder
this
made
the
men
angry
in
turn
for
they
did
not
know
the
reason
why
the
loved
the
monkey
and
they
told
him
they
would
not
forget
the
way
he
had
insulted
them
of
course
he
had
not
insulted
them
at
all
but
foreign
sailors
are
sometimes
and
these
men
came
from
a
country
where
slights
are
easily
felt
the
sailors
spent
the
whole
day
on
shore
as
the
wind
was
unfavourable
for
getting
out
to
sea
but
no
one
saw
them
enter
the
lighthouse
again
next
morning
all
that
the
saw
of
the
sailors
and
their
ship
was
the
tips
of
their
dipping
over
the
horizon
edge
and
all
that
he
saw
of
the
monkey
that
would
not
kill
after
searching
night
and
day
for
a
week
was
nothing

to

read
one
morning
the
following
paragraph
in
the
francisco
tale
of
the
captain
dawkins
of
the
which
has
just
arrived
in
this
port
from
liverpool
reports
a
singular
occurrence
about
ten
days
out
from
home
the
observed
what
he
took
to
be
a
great
but
which
on
further
inspection
turned
out
to
be
a
quantity
of
wreckage
on
approaching
the
spot
the
figure
of
a
boy
was
distinctly
observed
clinging
to
the
broken
portion
of
a
mast
and
obviously
still
alive
a
small
boat
was
instantly
lowered
the
ship
crew
meantime
making
signals
to
the
boy
to
inform
him
that
he
was
being
rescued
after
a
suspense
of
some
the
boat
returned
with
the
extraordinary
intelligence
that
the
figure
seen
was
not
that
of
a
boy
but
of
a
monkey
search
among
the
wreckage
for
human
remains
proved
unavailing
and
it
is
feared
that
a
serious
catastrophe
has
occurred
the
only
clue
to
the
nationality
of
the
vessel
which
it
is
only
too
plain
has
met
with
a
disastrous
fate

the
letters

what
interested
donald
donald
he
was
always
called
in
this
story
was
not
the
monkey
but
the
arrival
of
the
for
the
captain
was
a
friend
of
his
and
was
bringing
him
some
tools
from
home
in
this
very
ship
though
donald
was
now
a
he
came
out
from
scotland
when
quite
a
lad
his
father
was
a
small
farmer
in
skye
and
dying
early
the
family
emigrated
to
america
as
it
was
to
get
these
tools
that
donald
came
in
to
san
francisco
he
soon
found
his
way
to
the
harbour
and
finding
out
the
walked
on
board
no
one
was
visible
on
deck
so
donald
sat
down
on
a
coil
of
rope
to
wait
he
had
not
been
there
three
minutes
when
a
matted
head
and
two
very
brilliant
eyes
suddenly
shot
up
the
companion
and
a
monkey
sprang
in
front
of
him
and
stared
into
his
face
donald
much
startled
by
this
apparition
called
out
in
a
loud
voice
for
the
creature
to
go
away
but
the
moment
the
words
were
spoken
the
monkey
sprang
on
his
back
and
clasped
its
long
hairy
arms
about
his
neck
the
miner
shook
it
off
in
terror
and
tried
to
run
ashore
but
the
monkey
followed
frisking
and
gambolling
round
him
and
chasing
him
all
over
the
quay
donald
soon
discovered
however
that
the
monkey
meant
no
harm
and
a
few
days
later
an
explanation
of
this
sudden
outburst
of
interest
in
a
stranger
the
captain
told
donald
that
the
monkey
had
never
been
known
to
behave
like
this
before
broke
in
upon
the
miner
mind
he
remembered
that
when
he
suddenly
spoke
to
the
monkey
he
had
called
to
it
under
the
impulse
of
a
sudden
fear
i
suppose
the
language
of
his
boyhood
had
started
to
his
lips
and
the
words
came
out
unconsciously
air
which
means
away
what
made
donald
remember
the
circumstance
was
this
that
whenever
afterwards
he
used
the
highland
tongue
the
monkey
manifested
peculiar
signs
of
joy
the
only
way
the
miner
could
account
for
this
singular
fact
was
to
suppose
that
somehow
or
other
this
monkey
had
once
belonged
to
some
one
who
used
the
gaelic
language
a
suggestion
however
which
people
generally
laughed
at
the
miner
always
maintained
nevertheless
that
the
monkey
really
knew
gaelic
and
he
seldom
spoke
to
it
in
any
other
language
of
course
people
said
this
was
simply
to
show
off
that
he
knew
two
languages
i
do
not
know
whether
the
miner
bought
the
monkey
or
whether
the
captain
gave
it
to
him
or
whether
it
ran
away
but
it
is
certain
that
from
this
hour
it
belonged
to
donald
when
he
left
the
ship
with
his
tools
the
monkey
followed
trotting
after
him
like
a
dog
all
the
way
till
he
reached
his
lodgings
the
miner
then
went
into
the
house
and
shut
the
door
leaving
the
monkey
outside
in
ten
minutes
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
boys
in
san
francisco
had
gathered
in
that
street
they
formed
a
crowd
round
the
door
which
almost
stopped
the
traffic
and
when
the
policeman
shortly
appeared
he
was
rather
disgusted
to
find
that
it
was
only
a
monkey
performing
gymnastic
exercises
on
a
roughly
ringing
the
bell
he
ordered
donald
to
take
in
his
monkey
donald
replied
meekly
that
he
was
not
responsible
for
the
monkey
but
the
officer
said
he
would
be
summoned
for
the
thoroughfare
and
causing
a
breach
of
the
peace
if
he
did
not
take
in
his
guest
at
once
so
donald
had
to
submit
for
he
saw
there
would
be
no
rest
in
san
francisco
till
this
wayward
creature
had
its
will
and
was
safe
inside
that
night
donald
had
a
serious
talk
with
the
monkey
as
it
sat
upright
in
its
chair
at
supper
he
told
it
that
if
it
would
behave
itself
he
would
take
it
up
to
the
rocky
mountains
to
the
gold
diggings
the
monkey
seemed
to
understand
for
it
put
down
a
lump
of
cheese
it
was
about
to
eat
skipped
off
its
chair
and
nestled
against
big
donald
side
only
one
other
thing
happened
that
night
donald
gave
the
monkey
its
name
he
called
it
because
it
stuck
to
him

iii
next
morning
donald
and
gum
started
from
san
francisco
by
an
early
train
on
their
way
to
silver
creek
the
appearance
of
the
monkey
in
the
railway
carriage
created
much
amusement
among
the
passengers
and
donald
had
to
stand
a
of
questions
as
to
whether
it
belonged
to
his
or
to
a
the
fun
was
stopped
in
a
little
while
by
the
entrance
of
the
conductor
who
demanded
ticket
gum
not
having
a
ticket
an
angry
discussion
arose
on
the
subject
of
fare
but
donald
said
he
would
only
pay
when
the
conductor
showed
him
the
correct
price
for
a
monkey
printed
in
black
and
white
in
the
official
books
there
being
no
special
mention
in
these
volumes
of
monkeys
on
tour
donald
declined
to
pay
a
cent
and
the
conductor
departed
vowing
he
would
put
gum
out
of
the
train
at
the
next
station
when
the
next
station
came
however
donald
and
the
monkey
were
entrenched
in
a
corner
the
latter
tightly
grasped
in
the
miner
great
arms
and
the
conductor
after
a
glance
at
the
situation
decided
to
wait
for
a
more
convenient
season
in
america
the
conductor
instead
of
entering
the
carriages
only
when
the
train
stops
moves
about
all
the
time
from
one
carriage
to
another
so
that
as
the
station
for
silver
creek
was
still
eleven
hours
distant
he
had
little
doubt
his
chance
would
come
illustration
buried
his
teeth
in
the
conductor
wrist
and
come
it
did
it
was
a
piping
hot
day
even
for
california
and
late
in
the
afternoon
donald
fell
asleep
his
arms
were
still
clasped
round
the
monkey
and
the
conductor
would
never
have
succeeded
in
his
object
but
for
an
accident
it
happened
that
about
that
time
the
train
was
approaching
an
important
junction
and
part
of
every
ticket
had
to
be
given
up
at
that
point
in
america
a
railway
ticket
is
sometimes
half
a
yard
in
length
and
pieces
have
to
be
torn
off
from
point
to
point
to
avoid
the
disturbance
caused
by
this
operation
miners
cowboys
and
others
are
in
the
habit
of
wearing
their
tickets
slipped
into
the
band
of
their
great
hats
and
donald
was
in
this
inviting
position
when
the
conductor
came
round
he
snatched
it
out
of
the
hat
to
tear
off
the
necessary
piece
when
the
monkey
thinking
a
theft
was
meant
sprang
at
the
man
and
buried
his
teeth
in
his
wrist
roaring
with
pain
the
conductor
seized
his
assailant
by
the
throat
and
before
donald
could
come
to
the
rescue
tossed
him
out
of
the
window
the
train
was
dashing
round
a
curve
at
thirty
miles
an
hour
and
when
donald
stretched
out
his
neck
to
find
out
whether
gum
was
killed
it
was
with
small
hope
of
ever
seeing
him
more
for
two
minutes
the
miner
gazed
at
the
receding
distance
then
without
uttering
a
word
turned
round
and
felled
the
conductor
to
the
floor
chapter
iv
when
the
train
rolled
into
the
junction
about
an
hour
after
donald
went
into
the
refreshment
room
to
quiet
his
nerves
with
a
cup
of
cocoa
he
was
about
to
take
his
seat
again
in
the
carriage
when
he
observed
a
crowd
on
the
platform
opposite
the
at
the
rear
end
of
the
train
making
his
way
to
the
spot
and
looking
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
what
was
his
amazement
to
see
gum
seated
on
the
coupling
apparatus
and
looking
about
him
with
perfect
serenity
one
hand
held
an
iron
rod
and
with
the
other
he
scratched
his
head
and
but
for
a
great
splash
of
brown
earth
on
one
side
the
monkey
seemed
wholly
untouched
by
his
adventure
a
single
word
in
gaelic
from
donald
made
the
monkey
spring
from
its
perch
and
over
the
heads
of
the
people
into
his
arms
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
strange
friends
were
pursuing
their
journey
again
as
if
nothing
had
happened
a
new
conductor
was
now
on
the
train
and
donald
made
friends
with
him
by
reciting
the
whole
adventure
so
that
they
were
allowed
to
end
the
day
in
peace
about
midnight
the
two
got
out
at
a
roadside
station
where
they
spent
the
night
and
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
set
out
by
coach
for
silver
creek
from
silver
creek
donald
cabin
was
still
thirty
miles
walk
over
the
mountains
and
after
another
day
hard
toiling
they
reached
the
spot
chapter
v
after
a
long
journey
over
the
mountains
donald
reached
his
log
cabin
on
the
silver
creek
the
monkey
however
did
not
find
quite
so
immediate
a
welcome
as
himself
from
donald
wife
the
only
pet
her
children
had
ever
seen
before
was
a
baby
puma
which
the
miner
had
picked
out
of
the
stream
one
day
in
a
state
donald
had
mistaken
it
for
a
kitten
of
some
new
brand
and
it
was
not
until
some
weeks
later
when
it
sprang
upon
his
little
girl
and
buried
his
claws
in
her
neck
that
he
realised
what
sort
of
plaything
the
puma
is
the
lion
of
the
rocky
mountains
he
had
introduced
into
his
family
so
donald
wife
was
suspicious
of
pets
and
when
she
saw
the
monkey
she
was
sure
it
was
another
lion
and
would
not
allow
it
to
enter
the
door
but
gum
had
other
ways
of
entering
houses
than
by
doors
and
finally
he
was
received
as
a
lawful
member
of
the
family
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
could
not
be
kept
out
the
new
guest
gave
little
trouble
most
of
the
day
the
monkey
spent
with
donald
at
the
mine
he
went
off
with
him
when
he
went
to
work
in
the
morning
and
gambolled
round
him
till
he
came
home
for
supper
and
very
soon
an
incident
happened
which
more
than
reconciled
donald
wife
to
her
strange
visitor
donald
was
a
poor
one
he
had
to
work
very
hard
to
get
enough
of
the
precious
dust
to
keep
his
family
in
food
but
his
spirits
were
kept
up
by
the
constant
hope
that
he
would
strike
a
richer
bed
and
make
his
fortune
the
way
he
got
the
gold
was
to
take
the
sand
and
gravel
from
the
banks
of
the
river
and
wash
it
about
in
a
pan
till
all
the
lighter
particles
passed
off
with
the
water
leaving
the
little
spangles
of
gold
at
the
bottom
sometimes
a
week
would
pass
without
the
miner
getting
more
than
a
thimbleful
but
occasionally
he
would
find
a
few
lumps
as
big
as
a
pea
one
day
however
just
as
donald
was
getting
discouraged
a
piece
of
great
befell
him
he
had
been
particularly
depressed
that
day
for
no
gold
at
all
had
rewarded
his
search
for
a
week
and
the
family
were
already
in
debt
for
flour
and
clothes
but
thanks
to
the
monkey
he
was
able
to
go
home
to
his
wife
with
the
largest
gold
nugget
that
had
been
seen
in
that
valley
for
many
years
gum
had
been
skirmishing
about
as
usual
on
the
gravel
heaps
when
some
loose
pebbles
were
dislodged
by
his
paws
and
as
they
rolled
down
he
must
have
been
attracted
by
the
yellow
glitter
in
one
large
lump
for
the
next
moment
he
had
picked
up
the
nugget
and
laid
it
with
a
wag
of
his
tail
at
donald
feet
the
miner
almost
wept
for
gladness
and
taking
gum
up
in
his
arms
as
if
he
were
a
child
hurried
home
to
proclaim
his
fortune
that
night
the
family
had
a
great
feast
and
gum
health
was
drunk
in
the
strongest
tea
the
mining
camp
could
furnish
perhaps
if
they
had
known
what
was
shortly
to
happen
they
would
not
have
slept
quite
so
soundly

two
nights
after
the
wheel
of
fortune
gave
an
turn
donald
wife
was
so
proud
of
the
nugget
that
she
could
not
keep
the
news
to
herself
and
next
morning
although
donald
had
carefully
told
her
to
keep
it
quiet
confided
his
to
another
miner
wife
who
lived
a
few
hundred
yards
off
this
worthy
woman
told
another
and
in
hours
the
fame
of
donald
nugget
was
spread
from
end
to
end
of
the
valley
this
would
not
have
mattered
in
most
places
but
mining
districts
are
peopled
by
criminals
and
adventurers
of
all
kinds
and
among
these
were
some
lawless
characters
whose
chief
business
was
to
get
gold
in
some
other
way
than
by
working
for
it
two
of
these
men
brothers
who
lived
with
their
families
at
the
lower
end
of
the
valley
determined
that
they
should
possess
themselves
of
donald
nugget
covering
their
faces
with
black
masks
and
armed
with
revolvers
they
set
off
about
midnight
for
the
miner
cabin
the
family
were
fast
asleep
and
the
robbers
noiselessly
pushed
up
the
window
and
entered
the
room
where
donald
slept
pointing
a
loaded
revolver
at
his
head
one
of
the
men
roughly
awoke
him
and
told
him
if
he
moved
or
cried
out
he
would
blow
out
his
brains
and
murder
every
one
in
the
house
donald
was
too
familiar
with
stories
of
camp
crime
to
resist
an
attack
so
sudden
and
though
a
loaded
revolver
was
under
his
own
pillow
he
saw
his
disadvantage
and
for
the
sake
of
his
wife
and
children
controlled
himself
with
a

the

him

the

you
mean

donald
made
no

if
he
said
it
was
gone
the
robbers
would
have
simply
sneaked
home
for
donald
was
known
in
these
parts
as
a
man
who
never
told
a
lie
once
more
the
robber
asked
him
but
donald
remained
silent
this
was
enough
if
it
had
really
been
gone
donald
would
have
certainly
said
so
so
while
the
first
man
stood
with
a
revolver
at
his
ear
the
second
proceeded
to
search
the
house
drawers
boxes
and
cupboards
were
opened
and
ransacked
in
quick
succession
every
corner
of
the
two
rooms
was
examined
the
very
dishes
on
the
shelf
were
turned
upside
down
and
the
smashed
to
pieces
with
a
blow
in
case
it
should
have
been
hidden

try

the
man

revolver

the
old
bear
and

if
i

it
once
more
the
house
was
ransacked
from
top
to
bottom
and
the
robber
was
about
to
abandon
the
search
when
a
sudden
thought
occurred
to
him
on
the
ticked
a
wooden
american
clock
about
two
feet
high
the
man
opened
the
door
in
the
case
and
fumbled
about
with
his
finger
next
moment
he
had
drawn
out
the
nugget
he
bent
over
the
fire
to
get
a
better
look
at
it
and
then
proceeded
to
weigh
it
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
to
see
how
much
it
was
worth
the
other
robber
unable
to
restrain
his
curiosity
moved
likewise
toward
the
fire
when
the
first
checked
him
with
an
angry
cry
and
sent
him
back
to
his
victim
side
to
continue
his
guard
another
moment
and
donald
would
have
had
his
revolver
out
and
the
nugget
would
have
been
saved
but
there
was
another
spectator
of
this
scene
on
whom
the
thieves
had
scarcely
reckoned
in
his
usual
berth
crouched
at
the
side
of
the
fireplace
sat
gum
the
robber
was
weighing
the
gold
in
his
hand
turning
it
round
and
round
and
gloating
over
it
when
the
glitter
from
the
precious
metal
attracted
the
monkey
eye
it
seemed
to
feel
some
sense
of
property
in
this
gold
for
quick
as
lightning
one
hairy
paw
brushed
the
hand
and
the
next
moment
the
nugget
was
gone
with
a
great
oath
the
robber
turned
on
gum
and
dealt
it
a
blow
on
the
head
which
knocked
it
senseless
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
but
before
that
blow
fell
two
things
happened
with
one
hand
held
out
to
protect
itself
against
this
sudden
onslaught
the
monkey
made
a
grab
at
its
assailant
face
and
tore
off
the
black
mask
so
that
donald
instantly
recognised
the
man
in
the
glow
of
the
firelight
with
the
other
hand
which
held
the
gold
the
monkey
swiftly
transferred
the
nugget
to
its
mouth
the
robber
eye
followed
this
last
movement
however
and
he
picked
up
gum
roughly
and
proceeded
to
wrench
open
its
jaws
he
felt
all
round
his
mouth
but
the
nugget
was
not
there
he
held
the
senseless
body
up
by
the
tail
and
shook
it
but
no
gold
appeared
he
took
his
head
between
his
knees
and
sounded
all
over
its
throat
but
the
nugget
was
not
to
be
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
not
there
the
blow
which
had
fallen
upon
the
monkey
head
had
knocked
it
down
its
throat
gum
had
swallowed
the
nugget
what
was
to
be
done
now
if
the
robber
had
had
a
knife
in
his
pocket
gum
would
have
been
a
dead
monkey
in
two
seconds
but
while
he
was
unsuccessfully
feeling
for
his
knife
gum
suddenly
came
to
and
with
one
violent
wriggle
shook
itself
free
and
sprang
on
the
highest
shelf
the
robber
gave
chase
then
followed
the
most
comical
hunt
you
ever
saw
the
robber
face
being
now
exposed
he
had
no
idea
that
donald
had
already
recognised
him
he
was
afraid
to
turn
round
and
he
had
to
keep
up
the
hunt
without
once
facing
in
the
direction
where
donald
lay
with
the
result
that
he
was
fairly
baffled
and
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
hard
work
gave
up
the
chase
all
that
remained
now
was
to
blind
donald
roughly
approaching
the
bed
the
robber
drew
the
blankets
over
face
and
told
him
he
would
shoot
him
if
he
dared
to
stir
as
an
extra
precaution
the
miner
revolver
was
taken
out
of
reach
and
then
both
men
started
with
a
piece
of
rope
to
secure
the
monkey
clever
as
gum
was
he
was
scarcely
a
match
for
two
men
who
as
noted
were
experts
in
the
use
of
the
lasso
and
in
a
short
time
the
monkey
was
ignominiously
driven
from
his
perch
on
a
rafter
tied
up
in
and
swung
over
the
shoulder
of
one
of
the
men
then
the
robbers
wished
donald
a
grim
and
marched
off
with
their
as
they
were
going
out
of
the
door
donald
called
after
them
ye
blackguards
and
mark
my
words
if
ye
lay
a
hand
on
that
monkey
ye
regret
it
as
long
as
ye
live
this
made
the
men
a
little
frightened
for
although
they
did
not
like
to
confess
it
to
one
another
there
was
something
about
gum
that
was
canny
anyhow
whether
it
was
fear
of
the
monkey
or
of
their
own
consciences
instead
of
killing
gum
as
soon
as
they
left
the
house
they
carried
it
all
the
way
home
with
them
discussing
which
of
them
was
to
kill
it
and
how
it
was
to
be
done
chapter
vii
when
the
thieves
reached
home
after
a
hasty
breakfast
they
continued
the
discussion
as
to
how
the
purse
was
to
be
opened
and
the
nugget
secured
unfortunately
for
them
the
monkey
had
struggled
out
of
the
as
soon
as
it
reached
the
house
and
the
robbers
children
at
once
seized
upon
it
and
claimed
it
as
their
pet
when
they
were
told
it
would
have
to
be
killed
the
youngest
child
a
little
girl
so
lovely
that
even
a
bad
father
could
not
help
loving
her
burst
into
tears
and
putting
her
arms
round
the
robber
neck
prayed
and
entreated
him
to
spare
its
life
and
let
her
play
with
it
now
wicked
as
this
man
was
this
child
had
a
mysterious
influence
over
him
and
though
he
was
resolved
to
kill
gum
and
that
immediately
he
determined
that
she
should
not
see
it
done
nor
even
know
that
he
had
done
it
besides
this
it
would
never
do
to
let
the
people
in
the
valley
know
that
they
had
killed
the
monkey
for
donald
would
surely
go
in
search
of
it
so
after
consulting
together
for
some
time
the
robbers
decided
on
a
plan
for
killing
gum
without
anybody
being
any
the
wiser
they
knew
that
if
they
shot
it
or
drowned
it
or
slew
it
with
a
knife
the
children
would
be
angry
and
the
story
would
certainly
be
told
to
their
playmates
and
passed
on
in
time
to
donald
family
so
a
very
diabolical
scheme
was
hatched
the
only
way
they
could
think
of
for
killing
gum
without
any
one
seeing
or
without
either
of
them
being
actually
present
at
the
death
was
to
it
up
with
this
method
had
another
advantage
which
neither
of
the
men
liked
to
confess
weighed
with
them
but
in
reality
it
was
this
more
than
anything
else
that
made
them
think
of
the
gunpowder
at
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
these
men
were
cowards
and
after
the
strange
threat
which
donald
had
uttered
as
they
were
leaving
his
house
they
were
secretly
afraid
lay
a
hand
upon
gum
a
monkey
was
a
very
mysterious
creature
they
had
never
had
anything
to
do
with
one
before
gum
face
had
a
curious
human
look
and
to
murder
it
in
cold
blood
was
almost
like
murdering
a
man
so
the
gunpowder
idea
seemed
the
very
solution
that
was
needed
and
they
set
about
their
preparations
at
once
while
one
of
the
men
remained
at
the
kitchen
fire
with
the
family
to
allay
suspicion
the
other
after
pocketing
a
little
can
of
miners
a
couple
of
feet
of
fuse
and
a
piece
of
string
strolled
out
to
the
wood
behind
the
cabin
on
the
pretence
of
giving
the
monkey
a
walk
as
soon
as
a
low
thicket
screened
the
pair
from
view
the
robber
tied
the
monkey
to
the
trunk
of
a
tree
then
he
lashed
the
can
of
gunpowder
tightly
to
the
monkey
tail
passed
one
end
of
the
fuse
into
it
through
a
small
hole
struck
a
match
and
lighted
the
other
end
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
fuse
was
fairly
lit
and
the
red
fire
slowly
creeping
upwards
he
ran
back
as
fast
as
he
could
to
the
house
meantime
the
other
man
had
got
a
concertina
from
the
shelf
and
was
playing
with
all
his
might
to
drown
the
sound
of
the
explosion
when
the
executioner
arrived
out
of
breath
though
he
was
he
joined
noisily
in
the
dance
which
the
children
had
set
up
the
moment
the
concertina
began
to
play
and
presently
such
a
stamping
and
shouting
was
going
on
in
the
cottage
that
the
sound
of
an
earthquake
would
have
been
quenched
suddenly
an
awful
interruption
occurred
through
the
open
door
the
monkey
bounded
in
and
taking
up
its
place
in
the
midst
of
the
circle
joined
in
the
dance
from
its
neck
dangled
a
piece
of
string
burnt
at
the
point
but
what
made
the
children
shriek
with
laughter
was
a
small
tin
can
tied
to
its
tail
which
clattered
about
with
every
turn
of
the
body
and
strange
to
say
had
a
sort
of
little
tail
of
its
own
which
appeared
to
be
on
fire
for
little
puffs
of
smoke
were
coming
from
it
and
a
red
colour
glowed
at
the
tip
the
moment
the
robbers
caught
sight
of
this
apparition
there
was
a
yell
of
fear
which
paralysed
the
children
into
rigid
statues
the
men
faces
were
livid
with
terror
and
some
seconds
passed
before
either
had
recovered
his
senses
sufficiently
to
act
then
one
man
with
a
great
sweep
of
his
arms
caught
up
all
the
children
into
one
tumble
bunch
and
flung
them
screaming
with
pain
and
surprise
under
the
bed
of
the
adjoining
room
the
other
who
was
directly
responsible
for
the
mischief
seeing
that
the
only
chance
to
save
his
house
and
himself
was
to
get
gum
outside
clutched
the
smoking
monkey
in
his
arms
and
rushed
to
the
door
quick
as
the
movement
was
it
was
not
quick
enough
those
inside
heard
a
deafening
report
the
house
was
filled
with
smoke
the
doorway
became
a
heap
of
fallen
timber
and
the
blackened
body
of
a
man
lay
groaning
among
the
charred
ruins
one
of
the
robbers
their
wives
and
all
the
children
were
safe
but
when
the
smoke
cleared
away
and
the
body
by
the
door
was
examined
life
was
all
but
extinct
for
weeks
the
robber
hung
between
life
and
death
it
forms
no
part
of
this
story
to
tell
what
pains
he
suffered
or
what
agonies
of
mind
he
passed
through

how
when
months
after
he
was
able
to
crawl
from
his
bed
and
go
out
into
the
air
it
was
to
see
never
more
the
sunlight
or
the
flowers
with
his
sightless
eyes
certainly
words
had
come
true
when
the
miner
heard
that
evening
what
had
happened

he
had
already
sent
off

nearest
with

late
that
afternoon
the
monkey
turned
up
at
his
old
home
donald
found
him
lying
at
the
door
an
almost
unrecognisable
object
thanks
to
the
way
the
robber
had
carried
him
one
half
of
his
body
was
untouched
but
the
other
half
was
a
pitiable
spectacle
and
the
long
curly
tail
great
ornament
and
plaything
was
blown
off
by
the
root
the
poor
creature
had
swooned
but
that
he
had
lain
there
an
hour
or
two
in
great
pain
was
plain
from
the
way
the
gravel
was
tossed
about
in
all
directions
round
him
donald
was
greatly
touched
and
lifting
him
up
in
his
arms
as
tenderly
as
if
he
were
a
child
placed
him
in
his
own
bed
and
dressed
his
burns
after
a
long
sleep
it
awoke
and
donald
who
had
sat
silently
by
his
side
bent
over
to
allow
it
to
lick
his
face
the
moment
it
opened
its
mouth
the
miner
sprang
from
his
chair
as
if
he
had
been
shot
for
there
between
his
teeth

monkey
held
the
nugget

of
precious
things
which
he
delights
to
show
to
the
many
visitors
who
flock
to

of
all
these

by

finder
of

gum
found
the
nugget
and
how
it
was
stolen
and

brought
back
and

gum
got
better
the
two
went

the
big
lump
was
found

searched

lump

was
