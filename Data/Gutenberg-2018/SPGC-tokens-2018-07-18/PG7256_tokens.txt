the
gift
of
the
magi
by
henry
one
dollar
and
cents
that
was
all
and
sixty
cents
of
it
was
in
pennies
pennies
saved
one
and
two
at
a
time
by
bulldozing
the
grocer
and
the
vegetable
man
and
the
butcher
until
one
cheeks
burned
with
the
silent
imputation
of
parsimony
that
such
close
dealing
implied
three
times
della
counted
it
one
dollar
and
cents
and
the
next
day
would
be
christmas
there
was
clearly
nothing
to
do
but
flop
down
on
the
shabby
little
couch
and
howl
so
della
did
it
which
instigates
the
moral
reflection
that
life
is
made
up
of
sobs
sniffles
and
smiles
with
sniffles
predominating
while
the
mistress
of
the
home
is
gradually
subsiding
from
the
first
stage
to
the
second
take
a
look
at
the
home
a
furnished
flat
at
per
week
it
did
not
exactly
beggar
description
but
it
certainly
had
that
word
on
the
lookout
for
the
mendicancy
squad
in
the
vestibule
below
was
a
into
which
no
letter
would
go
and
an
electric
button
from
which
no
mortal
finger
could
coax
a
ring
also
appertaining
thereunto
was
a
card
bearing
the
name
james
dillingham
young
the
dillingham
had
been
flung
to
the
breeze
during
a
former
period
of
prosperity
when
its
possessor
was
being
paid
per
week
now
when
the
income
was
shrunk
to
though
they
were
thinking
seriously
of
contracting
to
a
modest
and
unassuming
but
whenever
james
dillingham
young
came
home
and
reached
his
flat
above
he
was
called
jim
and
greatly
hugged
by
james
dillingham
young
already
introduced
to
you
as
della
which
is
all
very
good
della
finished
her
cry
and
attended
to
her
cheeks
with
the
powder
rag
she
stood
by
the
window
and
looked
out
dully
at
a
gray
cat
walking
a
gray
fence
in
a
gray
backyard
tomorrow
would
be
christmas
day
and
she
had
only
with
which
to
buy
jim
a
present
she
had
been
saving
every
penny
she
could
for
months
with
this
result
twenty
dollars
a
week
does
go
far
expenses
had
been
greater
than
she
had
calculated
they
always
are
only
to
buy
a
present
for
jim
her
jim
many
a
happy
hour
she
had
spent
planning
for
something
nice
for
him
something
fine
and
rare
and
sterling
something
just
a
little
bit
near
to
being
worthy
of
the
honor
of
being
owned
by
jim
there
was
a
between
the
windows
of
the
room
perhaps
you
have
seen
a
pierglass
in
an
flat
a
very
thin
and
very
agile
person
may
by
observing
his
reflection
in
a
rapid
sequence
of
longitudinal
strips
obtain
a
fairly
accurate
conception
of
his
looks
della
being
slender
had
mastered
the
art
suddenly
she
whirled
from
the
window
and
stood
before
the
glass
her
eyes
were
shining
brilliantly
but
her
face
had
lost
its
color
within
twenty
seconds
rapidly
she
pulled
down
her
hair
and
let
it
fall
to
its
full
length
now
there
were
two
possessions
of
the
james
dillingham
youngs
in
which
they
both
took
a
mighty
pride
one
was
jim
gold
watch
that
had
been
his
father
and
his
grandfather
the
other
was
della
hair
had
the
queen
of
sheba
lived
in
the
flat
across
the
airshaft
della
would
have
let
her
hair
hang
out
the
window
some
day
to
dry
just
to
depreciate
her
majesty
jewels
and
gifts
had
king
solomon
been
the
janitor
with
all
his
treasures
piled
up
in
the
basement
jim
would
have
pulled
out
his
watch
every
time
he
passed
just
to
see
him
pluck
at
his
beard
from
envy
so
now
della
beautiful
hair
fell
about
her
rippling
and
shining
like
a
cascade
of
brown
waters
it
reached
below
her
knee
and
made
itself
almost
a
garment
for
her
and
then
she
did
it
up
again
nervously
and
quickly
once
she
faltered
for
a
minute
and
stood
still
while
a
tear
or
two
splashed
on
the
worn
red
carpet
on
went
her
old
brown
jacket
on
went
her
old
brown
hat
with
a
whirl
of
skirts
and
with
the
brilliant
sparkle
still
in
her
eyes
she
fluttered
out
the
door
and
down
the
stairs
to
the
street
where
she
stopped
the
sign
read
mme
sofronie
hair
goods
of
all
kinds
one
flight
up
della
ran
and
collected
herself
panting
madame
large
too
white
chilly
hardly
looked
the
sofronie
will
you
buy
my
hair
asked
della
i
buy
hair
said
madame
take
yer
hat
off
and
let
have
a
sight
at
the
looks
of
it
down
rippled
the
brown
cascade
twenty
dollars
said
madame
lifting
the
mass
with
a
practised
hand
give
it
to
me
quick
said
della
oh
and
the
next
two
hours
tripped
by
on
rosy
wings
forget
the
hashed
metaphor
she
was
ransacking
the
stores
for
jim
present
she
found
it
at
last
it
surely
had
been
made
for
jim
and
no
one
else
there
was
no
other
like
it
in
any
of
the
stores
and
she
had
turned
all
of
them
inside
out
it
was
a
platinum
fob
chain
simple
and
chaste
in
design
properly
proclaiming
its
value
by
substance
alone
and
not
by
meretricious
ornamentation
as
all
good
things
should
do
it
was
even
worthy
of
the
watch
as
soon
as
she
saw
it
she
knew
that
it
must
be
jim
it
was
like
him
quietness
and
value
the
description
applied
to
both
dollars
they
took
from
her
for
it
and
she
hurried
home
with
the
cents
with
that
chain
on
his
watch
jim
might
be
properly
anxious
about
the
time
in
any
company
grand
as
the
watch
was
he
sometimes
looked
at
it
on
the
sly
on
account
of
the
old
leather
strap
that
he
used
in
place
of
a
chain
when
della
reached
home
her
intoxication
gave
way
a
little
to
prudence
and
reason
she
got
out
her
curling
irons
and
lighted
the
gas
and
went
to
work
repairing
the
ravages
made
by
generosity
added
to
love
which
is
always
a
tremendous
task
dear
friends
a
mammoth
task
within
forty
minutes
her
head
was
covered
with
tiny
curls
that
made
her
look
wonderfully
like
a
truant
schoolboy
she
looked
at
her
reflection
in
the
mirror
long
carefully
and
critically
if
jim
does
kill
me
she
said
to
herself
before
he
takes
a
second
look
at
me
he
say
i
look
like
a
coney
island
chorus
girl
but
what
could
i
do
oh
what
could
i
do
with
a
dollar
and
cents
at
the
coffee
was
made
and
the
was
on
the
back
of
the
stove
hot
and
ready
to
cook
the
chops
jim
was
never
late
della
doubled
the
fob
chain
in
her
hand
and
sat
on
the
corner
of
the
table
near
the
door
that
he
always
entered
then
she
heard
his
step
on
the
stair
away
down
on
the
first
flight
and
she
turned
white
for
just
a
moment
she
had
a
habit
of
saying
a
little
silent
prayer
about
the
simplest
everyday
things
and
now
she
whispered
please
god
make
him
think
i
am
still
pretty
the
door
opened
and
jim
stepped
in
and
closed
it
he
looked
thin
and
very
serious
poor
fellow
he
was
only
and
to
be
burdened
with
a
family
he
needed
a
new
overcoat
and
he
was
without
gloves
jim
stopped
inside
the
door
as
immovable
as
a
setter
at
the
scent
of
quail
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
della
and
there
was
an
expression
in
them
that
she
could
not
read
and
it
terrified
her
it
was
not
anger
nor
surprise
nor
disapproval
nor
horror
nor
any
of
the
sentiments
that
she
had
been
prepared
for
he
simply
stared
at
her
fixedly
with
that
peculiar
expression
on
his
face
della
wriggled
off
the
table
and
went
for
him
jim
darling
she
cried
do
look
at
me
that
way
i
had
my
hair
cut
off
and
sold
because
i
could
have
lived
through
christmas
without
giving
you
a
present
it
grow
out
again
you
wo
mind
will
you
i
just
had
to
do
it
my
hair
grows
awfully
fast
say
christmas
jim
and
let
be
happy
you
do
know
what
a
nice
what
a
beautiful
nice
gift
i
got
for
you
you
cut
off
your
hair
asked
jim
laboriously
as
if
he
had
not
arrived
at
that
patent
fact
yet
even
after
the
hardest
mental
labor
cut
it
off
and
sold
it
said
della
do
you
like
me
just
as
well
anyhow
i
me
without
my
hair
ai
i
jim
looked
about
the
room
curiously
you
say
your
hair
is
gone
he
said
with
an
air
almost
of
idiocy
you
need
look
for
it
said
della
it
sold
i
tell
you
sold
and
gone
too
it
christmas
eve
boy
be
good
to
me
for
it
went
for
you
maybe
the
hairs
of
my
head
were
numbered
she
went
on
with
sudden
serious
sweetness
but
nobody
could
ever
count
my
love
for
you
shall
i
put
the
chops
on
jim
out
of
his
trance
jim
seemed
quickly
to
wake
he
enfolded
his
della
for
ten
seconds
let
us
regard
with
discreet
scrutiny
some
inconsequential
object
in
the
other
direction
eight
dollars
a
week
or
a
million
a
year
what
is
the
difference
a
mathematician
or
a
wit
would
give
you
the
wrong
answer
the
magi
brought
valuable
gifts
but
that
was
not
among
them
this
dark
assertion
will
be
illuminated
later
on
jim
drew
a
package
from
his
overcoat
pocket
and
threw
it
upon
the
table
do
make
any
mistake
dell
he
said
about
me
i
do
think
there
anything
in
the
way
of
a
haircut
or
a
shave
or
a
shampoo
that
could
make
me
like
my
girl
any
less
but
if
you
unwrap
that
package
you
may
see
why
you
had
me
going
a
while
at
first
white
fingers
and
nimble
tore
at
the
string
and
paper
and
then
an
ecstatic
scream
of
joy
and
then
alas
a
quick
feminine
change
to
hysterical
tears
and
wails
necessitating
the
immediate
employment
of
all
the
comforting
powers
of
the
lord
of
the
flat
for
there
lay
the
combs
the
set
of
combs
side
and
back
that
della
had
worshipped
long
in
a
broadway
window
beautiful
combs
pure
tortoise
shell
with
jewelled
rims
just
the
shade
to
wear
in
the
beautiful
vanished
hair
they
were
expensive
combs
she
knew
and
her
heart
had
simply
craved
and
yearned
over
them
without
the
least
hope
of
possession
and
now
they
were
hers
but
the
tresses
that
should
have
adorned
the
coveted
adornments
were
gone
but
she
hugged
them
to
her
bosom
and
at
length
she
was
able
to
look
up
with
dim
eyes
and
a
smile
and
say
my
hair
grows
so
fast
jim
and
then
della
leaped
up
like
a
little
singed
cat
and
cried
oh
oh
jim
had
not
yet
seen
his
beautiful
present
she
held
it
out
to
him
eagerly
upon
her
open
palm
the
dull
precious
metal
seemed
to
flash
with
a
reflection
of
her
bright
and
ardent
spirit
is
it
a
dandy
jim
i
hunted
all
over
town
to
find
it
you
have
to
look
at
the
time
a
hundred
times
a
day
now
give
me
your
watch
i
want
to
see
how
it
looks
on
it
instead
of
obeying
jim
tumbled
down
on
the
couch
and
put
his
hands
under
the
back
of
his
head
and
smiled
dell
said
he
let
put
our
christmas
presents
away
and
keep
a
while
they
too
nice
to
use
just
at
present
i
sold
the
watch
to
get
the
money
to
buy
your
combs
and
now
suppose
you
put
the
chops
on
the
magi
as
you
know
were
wise
men
wonderfully
wise
men
who
brought
gifts
to
the
babe
in
the
manger
they
invented
the
art
of
giving
christmas
presents
being
wise
their
gifts
were
no
doubt
wise
ones
possibly
bearing
the
privilege
of
exchange
in
case
of
duplication
and
here
i
have
lamely
related
to
you
the
uneventful
chronicle
of
two
foolish
children
in
a
flat
who
most
unwisely
sacrificed
for
each
other
the
greatest
treasures
of
their
house
but
in
a
last
word
to
the
wise
of
these
days
let
it
be
said
that
of
all
who
give
gifts
these
two
were
the
wisest
of
all
who
give
and
receive
gifts
such
as
they
are
wisest
everywhere
they
are
wisest
they
are
the
magi
