a
man
of
his
day
as
the
milvains
sat
down
to
breakfast
the
clock
of
wattleborough
parish
church
struck
eight
it
was
two
miles
away
but
the
strokes
were
borne
very
distinctly
on
the
west
wind
this
autumn
morning
jasper
listening
before
he
cracked
an
egg
remarked
with
cheerfulness
there
s
a
man
being
hanged
in
london
at
this
surely
it
isn
t
necessary
to
let
us
know
that
said
his
sister
maud
coldly
and
in
such
a
tone
too
protested
his
sister
dora
who
is
it
inquired
mrs
milvain
looking
at
her
son
with
pained
forehead
i
don
t
know
it
happened
to
catch
my
eye
in
the
paper
yesterday
that
someone
was
to
be
hanged
at
newgate
this
morning
there
s
a
certain
satisfaction
in
reflecting
that
it
is
not
that
s
your
selfish
way
of
looking
at
things
said
maud
well
returned
jasper
seeing
that
the
fact
came
into
my
head
what
better
use
could
i
make
of
it
i
could
curse
the
brutality
of
an
age
that
sanctioned
such
things
or
i
could
grow
doleful
over
the
misery
of
the
poor
fellow
but
those
emotions
would
be
as
little
profitable
to
others
as
to
myself
it
just
happened
that
i
saw
the
thing
in
a
light
of
consolation
things
are
bad
with
me
but
not
so
bad
as
that
i
might
be
going
out
between
jack
ketch
and
the
chaplain
to
be
hanged
instead
of
that
i
am
eating
a
really
fresh
egg
and
very
excellent
buttered
toast
with
coffee
as
good
as
can
be
reasonably
expected
in
this
part
of
the
do
try
boiling
the
milk
mother
the
tone
in
which
i
spoke
was
spontaneous
being
so
it
needs
no
he
was
a
young
man
of
well
built
though
a
trifle
meagre
and
of
pale
complexion
he
had
hair
that
was
very
nearly
black
and
a
face
best
described
perhaps
as
of
bureaucratic
type
the
clothes
he
wore
were
of
expensive
material
but
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
service
his
collar
curled
over
at
the
corners
and
his
necktie
was
of
the
two
sisters
dora
aged
twenty
was
the
more
like
him
in
visage
but
she
spoke
with
a
gentleness
which
seemed
to
indicate
a
different
character
maud
who
was
had
bold
handsome
features
and
very
beautiful
hair
of
russet
tinge
hers
was
not
a
face
that
readily
smiled
their
mother
had
the
look
and
manners
of
an
invalid
though
she
sat
at
table
in
the
ordinary
way
all
were
dressed
as
ladies
though
very
simply
the
room
which
looked
upon
a
small
patch
of
garden
was
furnished
with
comfort
only
one
or
two
objects
suggesting
the
decorative
spirit
of
a
man
who
comes
to
be
hanged
pursued
jasper
impartially
has
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
he
has
brought
society
to
its
last
resource
he
is
a
man
of
such
fatal
importance
that
nothing
will
serve
against
him
but
the
supreme
effort
of
law
in
a
way
you
know
that
is
in
a
way
repeated
maud
scornfully
suppose
we
talk
of
something
else
suggested
dora
who
seemed
to
fear
a
conflict
between
her
sister
and
jasper
almost
at
the
same
moment
a
diversion
was
afforded
by
the
arrival
of
the
post
there
was
a
letter
for
mrs
milvain
a
letter
and
newspaper
for
her
son
whilst
the
girls
and
their
mother
talked
of
unimportant
news
communicated
by
the
one
correspondent
jasper
read
the
missive
addressed
to
himself
this
is
from
reardon
he
remarked
to
the
younger
girl
things
are
going
badly
with
him
he
is
just
the
kind
of
fellow
to
end
by
poisoning
or
shooting
but
why
can
t
get
anything
done
and
begins
to
be
sore
troubled
on
his
wife
s
is
he
ill
overworked
i
suppose
but
it
s
just
what
i
foresaw
he
isn
t
the
kind
of
man
to
keep
up
literary
production
as
a
paying
business
in
favourable
circumstances
he
might
write
a
fairly
good
book
once
every
two
or
three
years
the
failure
of
his
last
depressed
him
and
now
he
is
struggling
hopelessly
to
get
another
done
before
the
winter
season
those
people
will
come
to
the
enjoyment
with
which
he
anticipates
it
murmured
maud
looking
at
her
mother
not
at
all
said
jasper
it
s
true
i
envied
the
fellow
because
he
persuaded
a
handsome
girl
to
believe
in
him
and
share
his
risks
but
i
shall
be
very
sorry
if
he
goes
to
the
to
the
dogs
he
s
my
one
serious
friend
but
it
irritates
me
to
see
a
man
making
such
large
demands
upon
fortune
one
must
be
more
modest
as
i
am
because
one
book
had
a
sort
of
success
he
imagined
his
struggles
were
over
he
got
a
hundred
pounds
for
on
neutral
ground
and
at
once
counted
on
a
continuance
of
payments
in
geometrical
proportion
i
hinted
to
him
that
he
couldn
t
keep
it
up
and
he
smiled
with
tolerance
no
doubt
thinking
he
judges
me
by
but
i
didn
t
do
anything
of
the
toast
please
dora
i
m
a
stronger
man
than
reardon
i
can
keep
my
eyes
open
and
is
his
wife
the
kind
of
person
to
grumble
asked
mrs
milvain
well
yes
i
suspect
that
she
is
the
girl
wasn
t
content
to
go
into
modest
rooms
they
must
furnish
a
flat
i
rather
wonder
he
didn
t
start
a
carriage
for
her
well
his
next
book
brought
only
another
hundred
and
now
even
if
he
finishes
this
one
it
s
very
doubtful
if
he
ll
get
as
much
the
optimist
was
practically
a
mr
yule
may
leave
them
some
money
said
dora
yes
but
he
may
live
another
ten
years
and
he
would
see
them
both
in
marylebone
workhouse
before
he
advanced
sixpence
or
i
m
much
mistaken
in
him
her
mother
has
only
just
enough
to
live
upon
can
t
possibly
help
them
her
brother
wouldn
t
give
or
lend
twopence
has
mr
reardon
no
relatives
i
never
heard
him
make
mention
of
a
single
one
no
he
has
done
the
fatal
thing
a
man
in
his
position
if
he
marry
at
all
must
take
either
a
or
an
heiress
and
in
many
ways
the
is
how
can
you
say
that
asked
dora
you
never
cease
talking
about
the
advantages
of
oh
i
don
t
mean
that
for
me
the
would
be
preferable
by
no
means
but
for
a
man
like
reardon
he
is
absurd
enough
to
be
conscientious
likes
to
be
called
an
artist
and
so
on
he
might
possibly
earn
a
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
if
his
mind
were
at
rest
and
that
would
be
enough
if
he
had
married
a
decent
little
dressmaker
he
wouldn
t
desire
superfluities
and
the
quality
of
his
work
would
be
its
own
reward
as
it
is
he
s
and
i
repeat
said
maud
that
you
enjoy
the
nothing
of
the
kind
if
i
seem
to
speak
exultantly
it
s
only
because
my
intellect
enjoys
the
clear
perception
of
a
a
little
marmalade
dora
the
but
this
is
very
sad
jasper
said
mrs
milvain
in
her
way
i
suppose
they
can
t
even
go
for
a
holiday
quite
out
of
the
not
even
if
you
invited
them
to
come
here
for
a
week
now
mother
urged
maud
that
s
impossible
you
know
very
i
thought
we
might
make
an
effort
dear
a
holiday
might
mean
everything
to
no
no
fell
from
jasper
thoughtfully
i
don
t
think
you
d
get
along
very
well
with
mrs
reardon
and
then
if
her
uncle
is
coming
to
mr
yule
s
you
know
that
would
be
i
suppose
it
would
though
those
people
would
only
stay
a
day
or
two
miss
harrow
why
can
t
mr
yule
make
them
friends
those
two
lots
of
people
asked
dora
you
say
he
s
on
good
terms
with
i
suppose
he
thinks
it
s
no
business
of
jasper
mused
over
the
letter
from
his
friend
ten
years
hence
he
said
if
reardon
is
still
alive
i
shall
be
lending
him
a
smile
of
irony
rose
to
maud
s
lips
dora
laughed
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
exclaimed
their
brother
you
have
no
faith
but
just
understand
the
difference
between
a
man
like
reardon
and
a
man
like
me
he
is
the
old
type
of
unpractical
artist
i
am
the
literary
man
of
he
won
t
make
concessions
or
rather
he
can
t
make
them
he
can
t
supply
the
market
i
well
you
may
say
that
at
present
i
do
nothing
but
that
s
a
great
mistake
i
am
learning
my
business
literature
nowadays
is
a
trade
putting
aside
men
of
genius
who
may
succeed
by
mere
cosmic
force
your
successful
man
of
letters
is
your
skilful
tradesman
he
thinks
first
and
foremost
of
the
markets
when
one
kind
of
goods
begins
to
go
off
slackly
he
is
ready
with
something
new
and
appetising
he
knows
perfectly
all
the
possible
sources
of
income
whatever
he
has
to
sell
he
ll
get
payment
for
it
from
all
sorts
of
various
quarters
none
of
your
unpractical
selling
for
a
lump
sum
to
a
middleman
who
will
make
six
distinct
profits
now
look
you
if
i
had
been
in
reardon
s
place
i
d
have
made
four
hundred
at
least
out
of
the
optimist
i
should
have
gone
shrewdly
to
work
with
magazines
and
newspapers
and
foreign
publishers
and
all
sorts
of
people
reardon
can
t
do
that
kind
of
thing
he
s
behind
his
age
he
sells
a
manuscript
as
if
he
lived
in
sam
johnson
s
grub
street
but
our
grub
street
of
is
quite
a
different
place
it
is
supplied
with
telegraphic
communication
it
knows
what
literary
fare
is
in
demand
in
every
part
of
the
world
its
inhabitants
are
men
of
business
however
it
sounds
ignoble
said
maud
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
my
dear
girl
now
as
i
tell
you
i
am
slowly
but
surely
learning
the
business
my
line
won
t
be
novels
i
have
failed
in
that
direction
i
m
not
cut
out
for
the
work
it
s
a
pity
of
course
there
s
a
great
deal
of
money
in
it
but
i
have
plenty
of
scope
in
ten
years
i
repeat
i
shall
be
making
my
thousand
a
i
don
t
remember
that
you
stated
the
exact
sum
before
maud
observed
let
it
pass
and
to
those
who
have
shall
be
given
when
i
have
a
decent
income
of
my
own
i
shall
marry
a
woman
with
an
income
somewhat
larger
so
that
casualties
may
be
provided
dora
exclaimed
laughing
it
would
amuse
me
very
much
if
the
reardons
got
a
lot
of
money
at
mr
yule
s
death
and
that
can
t
be
ten
years
off
i
m
i
don
t
see
that
there
s
any
chance
of
their
getting
much
replied
jasper
meditatively
mrs
reardon
is
only
his
niece
the
man
s
brother
and
sister
will
have
the
first
helping
i
suppose
and
then
if
it
comes
to
the
second
generation
the
literary
yule
has
a
daughter
and
by
her
being
invited
here
i
should
think
she
s
the
favourite
niece
no
no
depend
upon
it
they
won
t
get
anything
at
having
finished
his
breakfast
he
leaned
back
and
began
to
unfold
the
london
paper
that
had
come
by
post
had
mr
reardon
any
hopes
of
that
kind
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
do
you
think
inquired
mrs
milvain
reardon
good
heavens
no
would
he
were
capable
of
such
forethought
in
a
few
minutes
jasper
was
left
alone
in
the
room
when
the
servant
came
to
clear
the
table
he
strolled
slowly
away
humming
a
tune
the
house
was
pleasantly
situated
by
the
roadside
in
a
little
village
named
finden
opposite
stood
the
church
a
plain
low
building
as
it
was
in
the
town
of
wattleborough
droves
of
beasts
and
sheep
occasionally
went
by
or
the
rattle
of
a
grazier
s
cart
sounded
for
a
moment
on
ordinary
days
the
road
saw
few
vehicles
and
pedestrians
were
rare
mrs
milvain
and
her
daughters
had
lived
here
for
the
last
seven
years
since
the
death
of
the
father
who
was
a
veterinary
surgeon
the
widow
enjoyed
an
annuity
of
two
hundred
and
forty
pounds
terminable
with
her
life
the
children
had
nothing
of
their
own
maud
acted
irregularly
as
a
teacher
of
music
dora
had
an
engagement
as
visiting
governess
in
a
wattleborough
family
twice
a
year
as
a
rule
jasper
came
down
from
london
to
spend
a
fortnight
with
them
marked
the
middle
of
his
autumn
visit
and
the
strained
relations
between
him
and
his
sisters
which
invariably
made
the
second
week
rather
trying
for
all
in
the
house
had
already
become
noticeable
in
the
course
of
the
morning
jasper
had
half
an
hour
s
private
talk
with
his
mother
after
which
he
set
off
to
roam
in
the
sunshine
shortly
after
he
had
left
the
house
maud
her
domestic
duties
dismissed
for
the
time
came
into
the
parlour
where
mrs
milvain
was
reclining
on
the
sofa
jasper
wants
more
money
said
the
mother
when
maud
had
sat
in
meditation
for
a
few
minutes
of
course
i
knew
that
i
hope
you
told
him
he
couldn
t
have
i
really
didn
t
know
what
to
say
returned
mrs
milvain
in
a
feeble
tone
of
worry
then
you
must
leave
the
matter
to
me
that
s
all
there
s
no
money
for
him
and
there
s
an
end
of
maud
set
her
features
in
sullen
determination
there
was
a
brief
silence
what
s
he
to
do
maud
to
do
how
do
other
people
do
what
do
dora
and
i
do
you
don
t
earn
enough
for
your
support
my
oh
well
broke
from
the
girl
of
course
if
you
grudge
us
our
food
and
lodging
don
t
be
so
you
know
very
well
i
am
far
from
grudging
you
anything
dear
but
i
only
meant
to
say
that
jasper
does
earn
something
you
it
s
a
disgraceful
thing
that
he
doesn
t
earn
as
much
as
he
needs
we
are
sacrificed
to
him
as
we
always
have
been
why
should
we
be
pinching
and
stinting
to
keep
him
in
idleness
but
you
really
can
t
call
it
idleness
maud
he
is
studying
his
pray
call
it
trade
he
prefers
it
how
do
i
know
that
he
s
studying
anything
what
does
he
mean
by
studying
and
to
hear
him
speak
scornfully
of
his
friend
mr
reardon
who
seems
to
work
hard
all
through
the
year
it
s
disgusting
mother
at
this
rate
he
will
never
earn
his
own
living
who
hasn
t
seen
or
heard
of
such
men
if
we
had
another
hundred
a
year
i
would
say
nothing
but
we
can
t
live
on
what
he
leaves
us
and
i
m
not
going
to
let
you
try
i
shall
tell
jasper
plainly
that
he
s
got
to
work
for
his
own
another
silence
and
a
longer
one
mrs
milvain
furtively
wiped
a
tear
from
her
cheek
it
seems
very
cruel
to
refuse
she
said
at
length
when
another
year
may
give
him
the
opportunity
he
s
waiting
opportunity
what
does
he
mean
by
his
opportunity
he
says
that
it
always
comes
if
a
man
knows
how
to
and
the
people
who
support
him
may
starve
meanwhile
now
just
think
a
bit
mother
suppose
anything
were
to
happen
to
you
what
becomes
of
dora
and
me
and
what
becomes
of
jasper
too
it
s
the
truest
kindness
to
him
to
compel
him
to
earn
a
living
he
gets
more
and
more
incapable
of
you
can
t
say
that
maud
he
earns
a
little
more
each
year
but
for
that
i
should
have
my
doubts
he
has
made
thirty
pounds
already
this
year
and
he
only
made
about
the
whole
of
last
we
must
be
fair
to
him
you
know
i
can
t
help
feeling
that
he
knows
what
he
s
about
and
if
he
does
succeed
he
ll
pay
us
all
maud
began
to
gnaw
her
fingers
a
disagreeable
habit
she
had
in
privacy
then
why
doesn
t
he
live
more
economically
i
really
don
t
see
how
he
can
live
on
less
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
london
you
know
the
cheapest
place
in
the
nonsense
maud
but
i
know
what
i
m
saying
i
ve
read
quite
enough
about
such
things
he
might
live
very
well
indeed
on
thirty
shillings
a
week
even
buying
his
clothes
out
of
but
he
has
told
us
so
often
that
it
s
no
use
to
him
to
live
like
that
he
is
obliged
to
go
to
places
where
he
must
spend
a
little
or
he
makes
no
well
all
i
can
say
is
exclaimed
the
girl
impatiently
it
s
very
lucky
for
him
that
he
s
got
a
mother
who
willingly
sacrifices
her
daughters
to
that
s
how
you
always
break
out
you
don
t
care
what
unkindness
you
say
it
s
a
simple
dora
never
speaks
like
because
she
s
afraid
to
be
no
because
she
has
too
much
love
for
her
mother
i
can
t
bear
to
talk
to
you
maud
the
older
i
get
and
the
weaker
i
get
the
more
unfeeling
you
are
to
scenes
of
this
kind
were
no
uncommon
thing
the
clash
of
tempers
lasted
for
several
minutes
then
maud
flung
out
of
the
room
an
hour
later
at
she
was
rather
more
caustic
in
her
remarks
than
usual
but
this
was
the
only
sign
that
remained
of
the
stormy
mood
jasper
renewed
the
conversation
look
here
he
began
why
don
t
you
girls
write
something
i
m
convinced
you
could
make
money
if
you
tried
there
s
a
tremendous
sale
for
religious
stories
why
not
patch
one
together
i
am
quite
why
don
t
you
do
it
yourself
retorted
maud
i
can
t
manage
stories
as
i
have
told
you
but
i
think
you
could
in
your
place
i
d
make
a
speciality
of
you
know
the
kind
of
thing
i
mean
they
sell
like
hot
cakes
and
there
s
so
deuced
little
enterprise
in
the
business
if
you
d
give
your
mind
to
it
you
might
make
hundreds
a
better
say
abandon
your
mind
to
why
there
you
are
you
re
a
sharp
enough
girl
you
can
quote
as
well
as
anyone
i
and
please
why
am
i
to
take
up
an
inferior
kind
of
work
inferior
oh
if
you
can
be
a
george
eliot
begin
at
the
earliest
opportunity
i
merely
suggested
what
seemed
practicable
but
i
don
t
think
you
have
genius
maud
people
have
got
that
ancient
prejudice
so
firmly
rooted
in
their
heads
that
one
mustn
t
write
save
at
the
dictation
of
the
holy
spirit
i
tell
you
writing
is
a
business
get
together
fair
specimens
of
the
prize
study
them
discover
the
essential
points
of
such
composition
hit
upon
new
attractions
then
go
to
work
methodically
so
many
pages
a
day
there
s
no
question
of
the
divine
afflatus
that
belongs
to
another
sphere
of
life
we
talk
of
literature
as
a
trade
not
of
homer
dante
and
shakespeare
if
i
could
only
get
that
into
poor
reardon
s
head
he
thinks
me
a
gross
beast
often
enough
what
the
devil
i
mean
what
on
earth
is
there
in
typography
to
make
everything
it
deals
with
sacred
i
don
t
advocate
the
propagation
of
vicious
literature
i
speak
only
of
good
coarse
marketable
stuff
for
the
world
s
vulgar
you
just
give
it
a
thought
maud
talk
it
over
with
he
resumed
presently
i
maintain
that
we
people
of
brains
are
justified
in
supplying
the
mob
with
the
food
it
likes
we
are
not
geniuses
and
if
we
sit
down
in
a
spirit
of
gravity
we
shall
produce
only
commonplace
stuff
let
us
use
our
wits
to
earn
money
and
make
the
best
we
can
of
our
lives
if
only
i
had
the
skill
i
would
produce
novels
the
trashiest
that
ever
sold
fifty
thousand
copies
but
it
needs
skill
mind
you
and
to
deny
it
is
a
gross
error
of
the
literary
pedants
to
please
the
vulgar
you
must
one
way
or
another
incarnate
the
genius
of
vulgarity
for
my
own
part
i
shan
t
be
able
to
address
the
bulkiest
multitude
my
talent
doesn
t
lend
itself
to
that
form
i
shall
write
for
the
upper
of
intellect
the
people
who
like
to
feel
that
what
they
are
reading
has
some
special
cleverness
but
who
can
t
distinguish
between
stones
and
paste
that
s
why
i
m
so
slow
in
warming
to
the
work
every
month
i
feel
surer
of
myself
however
that
last
thing
of
mine
in
the
west
end
distinctly
hit
the
mark
it
wasn
t
too
flashy
it
wasn
t
too
solid
i
heard
fellows
speak
of
it
in
the
mrs
milvain
kept
glancing
at
maud
with
eyes
which
desired
her
attention
to
these
utterances
none
the
less
half
an
hour
after
dinner
jasper
found
himself
encountered
by
his
sister
in
the
garden
on
her
face
a
look
which
warned
him
of
what
was
coming
i
want
you
to
tell
me
something
jasper
how
much
longer
shall
you
look
to
mother
for
support
i
mean
it
literally
let
me
have
an
idea
of
how
much
longer
it
will
he
looked
away
and
reflected
to
leave
a
margin
was
his
reply
let
us
say
twelve
better
say
your
favourite
ten
years
at
no
i
speak
by
the
card
in
twelve
months
time
if
not
before
i
shall
begin
to
pay
my
debts
my
dear
girl
i
have
the
honour
to
be
a
tolerably
individual
i
know
what
i
m
and
let
us
suppose
mother
were
to
die
within
half
a
year
i
should
make
shift
to
do
very
you
and
please
what
of
dora
and
me
you
would
write
maud
turned
away
and
left
him
he
knocked
the
dust
out
of
the
pipe
he
had
been
smoking
and
again
set
off
for
a
stroll
along
the
lanes
on
his
countenance
was
just
a
trace
of
solicitude
but
for
the
most
part
he
wore
a
thoughtful
smile
now
and
then
he
stroked
his
jaws
with
thumb
and
fingers
occasionally
he
became
observant
of
wayside
details
of
the
colour
of
a
maple
leaf
the
shape
of
a
tall
thistle
the
consistency
of
a
fungus
at
the
few
people
who
passed
he
looked
keenly
surveying
them
from
head
to
foot
on
turning
at
the
limit
of
his
walk
he
found
himself
almost
face
to
face
with
two
persons
who
were
coming
along
in
silent
companionship
their
appearance
interested
him
the
one
was
a
man
of
fifty
grizzled
hard
featured
slightly
bowed
in
the
shoulders
he
wore
a
grey
felt
hat
with
a
broad
brim
and
a
decent
suit
of
broadcloth
with
him
was
a
girl
of
perhaps
in
a
dress
with
very
little
ornament
and
a
yellow
straw
hat
of
the
shape
originally
appropriated
to
males
her
dark
hair
was
cut
short
and
lay
in
innumerable
crisp
curls
father
and
daughter
obviously
the
girl
to
a
casual
eye
was
neither
pretty
nor
beautiful
but
she
had
a
grave
and
impressive
face
with
a
complexion
of
ivory
tone
her
walk
was
gracefully
modest
and
she
seemed
to
be
enjoying
the
country
air
jasper
mused
concerning
them
when
he
had
walked
a
few
yards
he
looked
back
at
the
same
moment
the
unknown
man
also
turned
his
head
where
the
deuce
have
i
seen
them
him
and
the
girl
too
milvain
asked
himself
and
before
he
reached
home
the
recollection
he
sought
flashed
upon
his
mind
the
museum
of
course
chapter
ii
the
house
of
yule
i
think
said
jasper
as
he
entered
the
room
where
his
mother
and
maud
were
busy
with
plain
needlework
i
must
have
met
alfred
yule
and
his
how
did
you
recognise
them
mrs
milvain
inquired
i
passed
an
old
buffer
and
a
girl
whom
i
know
by
sight
at
the
british
museum
it
wasn
t
near
yule
s
house
but
they
were
taking
a
they
may
have
come
already
when
miss
harrow
was
here
last
she
said
in
about
a
no
mistaking
them
for
people
of
these
parts
even
if
i
hadn
t
remembered
their
faces
both
of
them
are
obvious
dwellers
in
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
is
miss
yule
such
a
fright
then
asked
maud
a
fright
not
at
all
a
good
example
of
the
modern
literary
girl
i
suppose
you
have
the
oddest
ideas
of
such
people
no
i
rather
like
the
look
of
her
simpatica
i
should
think
as
that
ass
whelpdale
would
say
a
very
delicate
pure
complexion
though
morbid
nice
eyes
figure
not
spoilt
yet
but
of
course
i
may
be
wrong
about
their
later
in
the
afternoon
jasper
s
conjecture
was
rendered
a
certainty
maud
had
walked
to
wattleborough
where
she
would
meet
dora
on
the
latter
s
return
from
her
teaching
and
mrs
milvain
sat
alone
in
a
mood
of
depression
there
was
a
ring
at
the
and
the
servant
admitted
miss
harrow
this
lady
acted
as
housekeeper
to
mr
john
yule
a
wealthy
resident
in
this
neighbourhood
she
was
the
sister
of
his
deceased
wife
a
thin
kindly
woman
of
the
greater
part
of
her
life
she
had
spent
as
a
governess
her
position
now
was
more
agreeable
and
the
removal
of
her
anxiety
about
the
future
had
developed
qualities
of
cheerfulness
which
formerly
no
one
would
have
suspected
her
to
possess
the
acquaintance
between
mrs
milvain
and
her
was
only
of
twelve
months
standing
prior
to
that
mr
yule
had
inhabited
a
house
at
the
end
of
wattleborough
remote
from
finden
our
london
visitors
came
yesterday
she
began
by
saying
mrs
milvain
mentioned
her
son
s
encounter
an
hour
or
two
ago
no
doubt
it
was
they
said
the
visitor
mrs
yule
hasn
t
come
i
hardly
expected
she
would
you
know
so
very
unfortunate
when
there
are
difficulties
of
that
kind
isn
t
it
she
smiled
confidentially
the
poor
girl
must
feel
it
said
mrs
milvain
i
m
afraid
she
does
of
course
it
narrows
the
circle
of
her
friends
at
home
she
s
a
sweet
girl
and
i
should
so
like
you
to
meet
her
do
come
and
have
tea
with
us
afternoon
will
you
or
would
it
be
too
much
for
you
just
now
will
you
let
the
girls
call
and
then
perhaps
miss
yule
will
be
so
good
as
to
come
and
see
me
i
wonder
whether
mr
milvain
would
like
to
meet
her
father
i
have
thought
that
perhaps
it
might
be
some
advantage
to
him
alfred
is
so
closely
connected
with
literary
people
you
i
feel
sure
he
would
be
glad
replied
mrs
milvain
but
what
of
jasper
s
friendship
with
mrs
edmund
yule
and
the
reardons
mightn
t
it
be
a
little
awkward
oh
i
don
t
think
so
unless
he
himself
felt
it
so
there
would
be
no
need
to
mention
that
i
should
say
and
really
it
would
be
so
much
better
if
those
estrangements
came
to
an
end
john
makes
no
scruple
of
speaking
freely
about
everyone
and
i
don
t
think
alfred
regards
mrs
edmund
with
any
serious
unkindness
if
mr
milvain
would
walk
over
with
the
young
ladies
it
would
be
very
then
i
think
i
may
promise
that
he
will
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
where
he
is
at
this
moment
we
don
t
see
very
much
of
him
except
at
he
won
t
be
with
you
much
longer
i
suppose
perhaps
a
before
miss
harrow
s
departure
maud
and
dora
reached
home
they
were
curious
to
see
the
young
lady
from
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
books
and
gladly
accepted
the
invitation
offered
them
they
set
out
on
the
following
afternoon
in
their
brother
s
company
it
was
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
s
walk
to
mr
yule
s
habitation
a
small
house
in
a
large
garden
jasper
was
coming
hither
for
the
first
time
his
sisters
now
and
then
visited
miss
harrow
but
very
rarely
saw
mr
yule
himself
who
made
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
he
cared
little
for
female
society
in
wattleborough
and
the
neighbourhood
opinions
varied
greatly
as
to
this
gentleman
s
character
but
women
seldom
spoke
very
favourably
of
him
miss
harrow
was
reticent
concerning
her
no
one
however
had
any
reason
to
believe
that
she
found
life
under
his
roof
disagreeable
that
she
lived
with
him
at
all
was
of
course
occasionally
matter
for
comment
certain
wattleborough
ladies
having
their
doubts
regarding
the
position
of
a
deceased
wife
s
sister
under
such
circumstances
but
no
one
was
seriously
exercised
about
the
relations
between
this
sober
lady
of
and
a
man
of
in
broken
health
a
word
of
the
family
history
john
alfred
and
edmund
yule
were
the
sons
of
a
wattleborough
stationer
each
was
well
educated
up
to
the
age
of
seventeen
at
the
town
s
grammar
school
the
eldest
who
was
a
lad
but
showed
capacities
for
business
worked
at
first
with
his
father
endeavouring
to
add
a
bookselling
department
to
the
trade
in
stationery
but
the
life
of
home
was
not
much
to
his
taste
and
at
he
obtained
a
clerk
s
place
in
the
office
of
a
london
newspaper
three
years
after
his
father
died
and
the
small
patrimony
which
fell
to
him
he
used
in
making
himself
practically
acquainted
with
the
details
of
paper
manufacture
his
aim
being
to
establish
himself
in
partnership
with
an
acquaintance
who
had
started
a
small
in
hertfordshire
his
speculation
succeeded
and
as
years
went
on
he
became
a
thriving
manufacturer
his
brother
alfred
in
the
meantime
had
drifted
from
work
at
a
london
bookseller
s
into
the
modern
grub
street
his
adventures
in
which
region
will
concern
us
hereafter
edmund
carried
on
the
wattleborough
business
but
with
small
success
between
him
and
his
eldest
brother
existed
a
good
deal
of
affection
and
in
the
end
john
offered
him
a
share
in
his
flourishing
paper
works
whereupon
edmund
married
deeming
himself
well
established
for
life
but
john
s
temper
was
a
difficult
one
edmund
and
he
quarrelled
parted
and
when
the
younger
died
aged
about
forty
he
left
but
moderate
provision
for
his
widow
and
two
children
only
when
he
had
reached
middle
age
did
john
marry
the
experiment
could
not
be
called
successful
and
mrs
yule
died
three
years
later
childless
at
john
yule
retired
from
active
business
he
came
back
to
the
scenes
of
his
early
life
and
began
to
take
an
important
part
in
the
municipal
affairs
of
wattleborough
he
was
then
a
remarkably
robust
man
fond
of
exercise
he
made
it
one
of
his
chief
efforts
to
encourage
the
local
volunteer
movement
the
cricket
and
football
clubs
public
sports
of
every
kind
showing
no
sympathy
whatever
with
those
persons
who
wished
to
establish
free
libraries
lectures
and
the
like
at
his
own
expense
he
built
for
the
volunteers
a
handsome
he
founded
a
public
gymnasium
and
finally
he
allowed
it
to
be
rumoured
that
he
was
going
to
present
the
town
with
a
park
but
by
presuming
too
far
upon
the
bodily
vigour
which
prompted
these
activities
he
passed
of
a
sudden
into
the
state
of
a
confirmed
invalid
on
an
autumn
expedition
in
the
hebrides
he
slept
one
night
under
the
open
sky
with
the
result
that
he
had
an
all
but
fatal
attack
of
rheumatic
fever
after
that
though
the
direction
of
his
interests
was
unchanged
he
could
no
longer
set
the
example
to
wattleborough
youth
of
muscular
manliness
the
infliction
did
not
improve
his
temper
for
the
next
year
or
two
he
was
constantly
at
warfare
with
one
or
other
of
his
colleagues
and
friends
ill
brooking
that
the
familiar
control
of
various
local
interests
should
fall
out
of
his
hands
but
before
long
he
appeared
to
resign
himself
to
his
fate
and
at
present
wattleborough
saw
little
of
him
it
seemed
likely
that
he
might
still
found
the
park
which
was
to
bear
his
name
but
perhaps
it
would
only
be
done
in
consequence
of
directions
in
his
will
it
was
believed
that
he
could
not
live
much
longer
with
his
kinsfolk
he
held
very
little
communication
alfred
yule
a
battered
man
of
letters
had
visited
wattleborough
only
twice
including
the
present
occasion
since
john
s
return
hither
mrs
edmund
yule
with
her
daughter
now
mrs
reardon
had
been
only
once
three
years
ago
these
two
families
as
you
have
heard
were
not
on
terms
of
amity
with
each
other
owing
to
difficulties
between
mrs
alfred
and
mrs
edmund
but
john
seemed
to
regard
both
impartially
perhaps
the
only
real
warmth
of
feeling
he
had
ever
known
was
bestowed
upon
edmund
and
miss
harrow
had
remarked
that
he
spoke
with
somewhat
more
interest
of
edmund
s
daughter
amy
than
of
alfred
s
daughter
marian
but
it
was
doubtful
whether
the
sudden
disappearance
from
the
earth
of
all
his
relatives
would
greatly
have
troubled
him
he
lived
a
life
of
curious
reading
newspapers
little
else
and
talking
with
old
friends
who
had
stuck
to
him
in
spite
of
his
irascibility
miss
harrow
received
her
visitors
in
a
small
and
soberly
furnished
she
was
nervous
probably
because
of
jasper
milvain
whom
she
had
met
but
once
last
spring
and
who
on
that
occasion
had
struck
her
as
an
alarmingly
modern
young
man
in
the
shadow
of
a
sat
a
slight
girl
whose
short
curly
hair
and
thoughtful
countenance
jasper
again
recognised
when
it
was
his
turn
to
be
presented
to
miss
yule
he
saw
that
she
doubted
for
an
instant
whether
or
not
to
give
her
hand
yet
she
decided
to
do
so
and
there
was
something
very
pleasant
to
him
in
its
warm
softness
she
smiled
with
a
slight
embarrassment
meeting
his
look
only
for
a
second
i
have
seen
you
several
times
miss
yule
he
said
in
a
friendly
way
though
without
knowing
your
name
it
was
under
the
great
she
laughed
readily
understanding
his
phrase
i
am
there
very
often
was
her
reply
what
great
dome
asked
miss
harrow
with
surprise
that
of
the
british
museum
explained
jasper
known
to
some
of
us
as
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
books
people
who
often
work
there
necessarily
get
to
know
each
other
by
sight
in
the
same
way
i
knew
miss
yule
s
father
when
i
happened
to
pass
him
in
the
road
the
three
girls
began
to
converse
together
perforce
of
trivialities
marian
yule
spoke
in
rather
slow
tones
thoughtfully
gently
she
had
linked
her
fingers
and
laid
her
hands
palms
downwards
upon
her
lap
a
nervous
action
her
accent
was
pure
unpretentious
and
she
used
none
of
the
fashionable
turns
of
speech
which
would
have
suggested
the
habit
of
intercourse
with
distinctly
metropolitan
society
you
must
wonder
how
we
exist
in
this
place
remarked
maud
rather
i
envy
you
marian
answered
with
a
slight
emphasis
the
door
opened
and
alfred
yule
presented
himself
he
was
tall
and
his
head
seemed
a
disproportionate
culmination
to
his
meagre
body
it
was
so
large
and
massively
featured
intellect
and
uncertainty
of
temper
were
equally
marked
upon
his
visage
his
brows
were
knitted
in
a
permanent
expression
of
severity
he
had
thin
smooth
hair
grizzled
whiskers
a
shaven
chin
in
the
multitudinous
wrinkles
of
his
face
lay
a
history
of
laborious
and
stormy
life
one
readily
divined
in
him
a
struggling
and
embittered
man
though
he
looked
older
than
his
years
he
had
by
no
means
the
appearance
of
being
beyond
the
ripeness
of
his
mental
vigour
it
pleases
me
to
meet
you
mr
milvain
he
said
as
he
stretched
out
his
bony
hand
your
name
reminds
me
of
a
paper
in
the
wayside
a
month
or
two
ago
which
you
will
perhaps
allow
a
veteran
to
say
was
not
ill
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
noticing
it
replied
jasper
there
was
positively
a
touch
of
visible
warmth
upon
his
cheek
the
allusion
had
come
so
unexpectedly
that
it
caused
him
keen
pleasure
mr
yule
seated
himself
awkwardly
crossed
his
legs
and
began
to
stroke
the
back
of
his
left
hand
which
lay
on
his
knee
he
seemed
to
have
nothing
more
to
say
at
present
and
allowed
miss
harrow
and
the
girls
to
support
conversation
jasper
listened
with
a
smile
for
a
minute
or
two
then
he
addressed
the
have
you
seen
the
study
this
week
mr
yule
did
you
notice
that
it
contains
a
very
favourable
review
of
a
novel
which
was
tremendously
abused
in
the
same
columns
three
weeks
ago
mr
yule
started
but
jasper
could
perceive
at
once
that
his
emotion
was
not
disagreeable
you
don
t
say
yes
the
novel
is
miss
hawk
s
on
the
how
will
the
editor
get
out
of
this
h
m
of
course
mr
fadge
is
not
immediately
responsible
but
it
ll
be
unpleasant
for
him
decidedly
he
smiled
grimly
you
hear
this
marian
how
is
it
explained
father
may
be
accident
of
course
but
well
there
s
no
knowing
i
think
it
very
likely
this
will
be
the
end
of
mr
fadge
s
tenure
of
office
rackett
the
proprietor
only
wants
a
plausible
excuse
for
making
a
change
the
paper
has
been
going
downhill
for
the
last
year
i
know
of
two
publishing
houses
who
have
withdrawn
their
advertising
from
it
and
who
never
send
their
books
for
review
everyone
foresaw
that
kind
of
thing
from
the
day
mr
fadge
became
editor
the
tone
of
his
paragraphs
has
been
detestable
two
reviews
of
the
same
novel
eh
and
diametrically
opposed
ha
ha
gradually
he
had
passed
from
quiet
appreciation
of
the
joke
to
undisguised
mirth
and
pleasure
his
utterance
of
the
name
mr
fadge
sufficiently
intimated
that
he
had
some
cause
of
personal
discontent
with
the
editor
of
the
study
the
author
remarked
milvain
ought
to
make
a
good
thing
out
of
will
no
doubt
ought
to
write
at
once
to
the
papers
calling
attention
to
this
sample
of
critical
impartiality
ha
ha
he
rose
and
went
to
the
window
where
for
several
minutes
he
stood
gazing
at
vacancy
the
same
grim
smile
still
on
his
face
jasper
in
the
meantime
amused
the
ladies
his
sisters
had
heard
him
on
the
subject
already
with
a
description
of
the
two
antagonistic
notices
but
he
did
not
trust
himself
to
express
so
freely
as
he
had
done
at
home
his
opinion
of
reviewing
in
general
it
was
more
than
probable
that
both
yule
and
his
daughter
did
a
good
deal
of
such
work
suppose
we
go
into
the
garden
suggested
miss
harrow
presently
it
seems
a
shame
to
sit
indoors
on
such
a
lovely
hitherto
there
had
been
no
mention
of
the
master
of
the
house
but
mr
yule
now
remarked
to
jasper
my
brother
would
be
glad
if
you
would
come
and
have
a
word
with
him
he
isn
t
quite
well
enough
to
leave
his
room
so
as
the
ladies
went
gardenwards
jasper
followed
the
man
of
letters
upstairs
to
a
room
on
the
first
floor
here
in
a
deep
cane
chair
which
was
placed
by
the
open
window
sat
john
yule
he
was
completely
dressed
save
that
instead
of
coat
he
wore
a
the
facial
likeness
between
him
and
his
brother
was
very
strong
but
john
s
would
universally
have
been
judged
the
finer
countenance
illness
notwithstanding
he
had
a
complexion
which
contrasted
in
its
pure
colour
with
alfred
s
parchmenty
skin
and
there
was
more
finish
about
his
features
his
abundant
hair
was
reddish
his
long
moustache
and
trimmed
beard
a
lighter
shade
of
the
same
hue
so
you
too
are
in
league
with
the
doctors
was
his
bluff
greeting
as
he
held
a
hand
to
the
young
man
and
inspected
him
with
a
look
of
slighting
well
that
certainly
is
one
way
of
regarding
the
literary
profession
admitted
jasper
who
had
heard
enough
of
john
s
way
of
thinking
to
understand
the
remark
a
young
fellow
with
all
the
world
before
him
too
hang
it
mr
milvain
is
there
no
less
pernicious
work
you
can
turn
your
hand
to
i
m
afraid
not
mr
yule
after
all
you
know
you
must
be
held
in
a
measure
responsible
for
my
how
s
that
i
understand
that
you
have
devoted
most
of
your
life
to
the
making
of
paper
if
that
article
were
not
so
cheap
and
so
abundant
people
wouldn
t
have
so
much
temptation
to
alfred
yule
uttered
a
short
laugh
i
think
you
are
cornered
i
wish
answered
john
that
you
were
both
condemned
to
write
on
such
paper
as
i
chiefly
made
it
was
a
special
kind
of
used
by
he
chuckled
inwardly
and
at
the
same
time
reached
out
for
a
box
of
cigarettes
on
a
table
near
him
his
brother
and
jasper
each
took
one
as
he
offered
them
and
began
to
smoke
you
would
like
to
see
literary
production
come
entirely
to
an
end
said
milvain
i
should
like
to
see
the
business
of
literature
there
s
a
distinction
of
course
but
on
the
whole
i
should
say
that
even
the
business
serves
a
good
what
purpose
it
helps
to
spread
civilisation
exclaimed
john
scornfully
what
do
you
mean
by
civilisation
do
you
call
it
civilising
men
to
make
them
weak
flabby
creatures
with
ruined
eyes
and
dyspeptic
stomachs
who
is
it
that
reads
most
of
the
stuff
that
s
poured
out
daily
by
the
ton
from
the
just
the
men
and
women
who
ought
to
spend
their
leisure
hours
in
exercise
the
people
who
earn
their
bread
by
sedentary
pursuits
and
who
need
to
live
as
soon
as
they
are
free
from
the
desk
or
the
counter
not
to
moon
over
small
print
your
board
schools
your
popular
press
your
spread
of
education
machinery
for
ruining
the
country
that
s
what
i
call
you
have
done
a
good
deal
i
think
to
counteract
those
influences
in
i
hope
so
and
if
only
i
had
kept
the
use
of
my
limbs
i
d
have
done
a
good
deal
more
i
have
an
idea
of
offering
substantial
prizes
to
men
and
women
engaged
in
sedentary
work
who
take
an
oath
to
abstain
from
all
reading
and
keep
it
for
a
certain
number
of
years
there
s
a
good
deal
more
need
for
that
than
for
abstinence
from
strong
liquor
if
i
could
have
had
my
way
i
would
have
revived
his
brother
laughed
with
contemptuous
impatience
you
would
doubtless
like
to
see
military
conscription
introduced
into
england
said
jasper
of
course
i
should
you
talk
of
civilising
there
s
no
such
way
of
civilising
the
masses
of
the
people
as
by
fixed
military
service
before
mental
training
must
come
training
of
the
body
go
about
the
continent
and
see
the
effect
of
military
service
on
loutish
peasants
and
the
lowest
classes
of
town
population
do
you
know
why
it
isn
t
even
more
successful
because
the
damnable
education
movement
interferes
if
germany
would
shut
up
her
schools
and
universities
for
the
next
quarter
of
a
century
and
go
ahead
like
blazes
with
military
training
there
d
be
a
nation
such
as
the
world
has
never
seen
after
that
they
might
begin
a
little
again
say
an
hour
and
a
half
a
day
for
everyone
above
nine
years
old
do
you
suppose
mr
milvain
that
society
is
going
to
be
reformed
by
you
people
who
write
for
money
why
you
are
the
very
first
class
that
will
be
swept
from
the
face
of
the
earth
as
soon
as
the
reformation
really
begins
alfred
puffed
at
his
cigarette
his
thoughts
were
occupied
with
mr
fadge
and
the
study
he
was
considering
whether
he
could
aid
in
bringing
public
contempt
upon
that
literary
organ
and
its
editor
milvain
listened
to
the
elder
man
s
diatribe
with
much
amusement
you
now
pursued
john
what
do
you
write
about
nothing
in
particular
i
make
a
salable
page
or
two
out
of
whatever
strikes
my
exactly
you
don
t
even
pretend
that
you
ve
got
anything
to
say
you
live
by
inducing
people
to
give
themselves
mental
indigestion
and
bodily
too
for
that
do
you
know
mr
yule
that
you
have
suggested
a
capital
idea
to
me
if
i
were
to
take
up
your
views
i
think
it
isn
t
at
all
unlikely
that
i
might
make
a
good
thing
of
writing
against
writing
it
should
be
my
literary
specialty
to
rail
against
literature
the
reading
public
should
pay
me
for
telling
them
that
they
oughtn
t
to
read
i
must
think
it
carlyle
has
anticipated
you
threw
in
alfred
yes
but
in
an
antiquated
way
i
would
base
my
polemic
on
the
newest
he
developed
the
idea
facetiously
whilst
john
regarded
him
as
he
might
have
watched
a
performing
monkey
there
again
your
new
philosophy
exclaimed
the
invalid
why
it
isn
t
even
wholesome
stuff
the
kind
of
reading
that
most
of
you
force
on
the
public
now
there
s
the
man
who
has
married
one
of
my
nieces
poor
lass
reardon
his
name
is
you
know
him
i
dare
say
just
for
curiosity
i
had
a
look
at
one
of
his
books
it
was
called
the
of
all
the
morbid
trash
i
ever
saw
that
beat
everything
i
thought
of
writing
him
a
letter
advising
a
couple
of
pills
before
bedtime
for
a
few
jasper
glanced
at
alfred
yule
who
wore
a
look
of
indifference
that
man
deserves
penal
servitude
in
my
opinion
pursued
john
i
m
not
sure
that
it
isn
t
my
duty
to
offer
him
a
couple
of
hundred
a
year
on
condition
that
he
writes
no
milvain
with
a
clear
vision
of
his
friend
in
london
burst
into
laughter
but
at
that
point
alfred
rose
from
his
chair
shall
we
rejoin
the
ladies
he
said
with
a
certain
pedantry
of
phrase
and
manner
which
often
characterised
him
think
over
your
ways
whilst
you
re
still
young
said
john
as
he
shook
hands
with
his
visitor
your
brother
speaks
quite
seriously
i
suppose
jasper
remarked
when
he
was
in
the
garden
with
alfred
i
think
so
it
s
amusing
now
and
then
but
gets
rather
tiresome
when
you
hear
it
often
you
are
not
personally
acquainted
with
mr
fadge
i
didn
t
even
know
his
name
until
you
mentioned
the
most
malicious
man
in
the
literary
world
there
s
no
uncharitableness
in
feeling
a
certain
pleasure
when
he
gets
into
a
scrape
i
could
tell
you
incredible
stories
about
him
but
that
kind
of
thing
is
probably
as
little
to
your
taste
as
it
is
to
miss
harrow
and
her
companions
having
caught
sight
of
the
pair
came
towards
them
tea
was
to
be
brought
out
into
the
garden
so
you
can
sit
with
us
and
smoke
if
you
like
said
miss
harrow
to
alfred
you
are
never
quite
at
your
ease
i
think
without
a
but
the
man
of
letters
was
too
preoccupied
for
society
in
a
few
minutes
he
begged
that
the
ladies
would
excuse
his
withdrawing
he
had
two
or
three
letters
to
write
before
which
was
early
at
finden
jasper
relieved
by
the
veteran
s
departure
began
at
once
to
make
himself
very
agreeable
company
when
he
chose
to
lay
aside
the
topic
of
his
own
difficulties
and
ambitions
he
could
converse
with
a
spontaneous
gaiety
which
readily
won
the
of
listeners
naturally
he
addressed
himself
very
often
to
marian
yule
whose
attention
complimented
him
she
said
little
and
evidently
was
at
no
time
a
free
talker
but
the
smile
on
her
face
indicated
a
mood
of
quiet
enjoyment
when
her
eyes
wandered
it
was
to
rest
on
the
beauties
of
the
garden
the
moving
patches
of
golden
sunshine
the
forms
of
gleaming
cloud
jasper
liked
to
observe
her
as
she
turned
her
head
there
seemed
to
him
a
particular
grace
in
the
movement
her
head
and
neck
were
admirably
formed
and
the
short
hair
drew
attention
to
this
it
was
agreed
that
miss
harrow
and
marian
should
come
on
the
second
day
after
to
have
tea
with
the
milvains
and
when
jasper
took
leave
of
alfred
yule
the
latter
expressed
a
wish
that
they
might
have
a
walk
together
one
of
these
mornings
chapter
iii
holiday
jasper
s
favourite
walk
led
him
to
a
spot
distant
perhaps
a
mile
and
a
half
from
home
from
a
tract
of
common
he
turned
into
a
short
lane
which
crossed
the
great
western
railway
and
thence
by
a
stile
into
certain
meadows
forming
a
compact
little
valley
one
recommendation
of
this
retreat
was
that
it
lay
sheltered
from
all
winds
to
jasper
a
wind
was
objectionable
along
the
bottom
ran
a
clear
shallow
stream
overhung
with
elder
and
hawthorn
bushes
and
close
by
the
wooden
bridge
which
spanned
it
was
a
great
ash
tree
making
shadow
for
cows
and
sheep
when
the
sun
lay
hot
upon
the
open
field
it
was
rare
for
anyone
to
come
along
this
path
save
farm
labourers
morning
and
evening
but
the
afternoon
that
followed
his
visit
to
john
yule
s
house
he
saw
from
a
distance
that
his
on
the
wooden
bridge
was
occupied
someone
else
had
discovered
the
pleasure
there
was
in
watching
the
sparkle
of
the
water
as
it
flowed
over
the
clean
sand
and
stones
a
girl
in
a
hat
yes
and
precisely
the
person
he
had
hoped
at
the
first
glance
that
it
might
be
he
made
no
haste
as
he
drew
nearer
on
the
descending
path
at
length
his
footstep
was
heard
marian
yule
turned
her
head
and
clearly
recognised
him
she
assumed
an
upright
position
letting
one
of
her
hands
rest
upon
the
rail
after
the
exchange
of
ordinary
greetings
jasper
leaned
back
against
the
same
support
and
showed
himself
disposed
for
talk
when
i
was
here
late
in
the
spring
he
said
this
ash
was
only
just
budding
though
everything
else
seemed
in
full
an
ash
is
it
murmured
marian
i
didn
t
know
i
think
an
oak
is
the
only
tree
i
can
distinguish
yet
she
added
quickly
i
knew
that
the
ash
was
late
some
lines
of
tennyson
come
to
my
which
are
those
delaying
as
the
tender
ash
delays
to
clothe
herself
when
all
the
woods
are
green
somewhere
in
the
i
don
t
remember
so
i
won
t
pretend
to
though
i
should
do
so
as
a
she
looked
at
him
oddly
and
seemed
about
to
laugh
yet
did
not
you
have
had
little
experience
of
the
country
jasper
continued
very
little
you
i
think
have
known
it
from
childhood
in
a
sort
of
way
i
was
born
in
wattleborough
and
my
people
have
always
lived
here
but
i
am
not
very
rural
in
temperament
i
have
really
no
friends
here
either
they
have
lost
interest
in
me
or
i
in
them
what
do
you
think
of
the
girls
my
sisters
the
question
though
put
with
perfect
simplicity
was
embarrassing
they
are
tolerably
intellectual
jasper
went
on
when
he
saw
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
her
to
answer
i
want
to
persuade
them
to
try
their
hands
at
literary
work
of
some
kind
or
other
they
give
lessons
and
both
hate
would
literary
work
be
less
burdensome
said
marian
without
looking
at
him
rather
more
so
you
think
she
hesitated
it
depends
of
course
on
on
several
to
be
sure
jasper
agreed
i
don
t
think
they
have
any
marked
faculty
for
such
work
but
as
they
certainly
haven
t
for
teaching
that
doesn
t
matter
it
s
a
question
of
learning
a
business
i
am
going
through
my
apprenticeship
and
find
it
a
long
affair
money
would
shorten
it
and
unfortunately
i
have
yes
said
marian
turning
her
eyes
upon
the
stream
money
is
a
help
in
without
it
one
spends
the
best
part
of
one
s
life
in
toiling
for
that
first
foothold
which
money
could
at
once
purchase
to
have
money
is
becoming
of
more
and
more
importance
in
a
literary
career
principally
because
to
have
money
is
to
have
friends
year
by
year
such
influence
grows
of
more
account
a
lucky
man
will
still
occasionally
succeed
by
dint
of
his
own
honest
perseverance
but
the
chances
are
dead
against
anyone
who
can
t
make
private
interest
with
influential
people
his
work
is
simply
overwhelmed
by
that
of
the
men
who
have
better
don
t
you
think
that
even
really
good
work
will
sooner
or
later
be
recognised
later
rather
than
sooner
and
very
likely
the
man
can
t
wait
he
starves
in
the
meantime
you
understand
that
i
am
not
speaking
of
genius
i
mean
marketable
literary
work
the
quantity
turned
out
is
so
great
that
there
s
no
hope
for
the
special
attention
of
the
public
unless
one
can
afford
to
advertise
hugely
take
the
instance
of
a
successful
man
of
letters
take
ralph
warbury
whose
name
you
ll
see
in
the
first
magazine
you
happen
to
open
but
perhaps
he
is
a
friend
of
yours
oh
no
well
i
wasn
t
going
to
abuse
him
i
was
only
going
to
ask
is
there
any
quality
which
distinguishes
his
work
from
that
of
twenty
struggling
writers
one
could
name
of
course
not
he
s
a
clever
prolific
man
so
are
they
but
he
began
with
money
and
friends
he
came
from
oxford
into
the
thick
of
advertised
people
his
name
was
mentioned
in
print
six
times
a
week
before
he
had
written
a
dozen
articles
this
kind
of
thing
will
become
the
rule
men
won
t
succeed
in
literature
that
they
may
get
into
society
but
will
get
into
society
that
they
may
succeed
in
yes
i
know
it
is
true
said
marian
in
a
low
voice
there
s
a
friend
of
mine
who
writes
novels
jasper
pursued
his
books
are
not
works
of
genius
but
they
are
glaringly
distinct
from
the
ordinary
circulating
novel
well
after
one
or
two
attempts
he
made
half
a
success
that
is
to
say
the
publishers
brought
out
a
second
edition
of
the
book
in
a
few
months
there
was
his
opportunity
but
he
couldn
t
use
it
he
had
no
friends
because
he
had
no
money
a
book
of
half
that
merit
if
written
by
a
man
in
the
position
of
warbury
when
he
started
would
have
established
the
reputation
of
a
lifetime
his
influential
friends
would
have
referred
to
it
in
leaders
in
magazine
articles
in
speeches
in
sermons
it
would
have
run
through
numerous
editions
and
the
author
would
have
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
write
another
book
and
demand
his
price
but
the
novel
i
m
speaking
of
was
practically
forgotten
a
year
after
its
appearance
it
was
whelmed
beneath
the
flood
of
next
season
s
marian
urged
a
hesitating
objection
but
under
the
circumstances
wasn
t
it
in
the
author
s
power
to
make
friends
was
money
really
indispensable
why
yes
because
he
chose
to
marry
as
a
bachelor
he
might
possibly
have
got
into
the
right
circles
though
his
character
would
in
any
case
have
made
it
difficult
for
him
to
curry
favour
but
as
a
married
man
without
means
the
situation
was
hopeless
once
married
you
must
live
up
to
the
standard
of
the
society
you
frequent
you
can
t
be
entertained
without
entertaining
in
return
now
if
his
wife
had
brought
him
only
a
couple
of
thousand
pounds
all
might
have
been
well
i
should
have
advised
him
in
sober
seriousness
to
live
for
two
years
at
the
rate
of
a
thousand
a
year
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
would
have
been
earning
enough
to
continue
at
pretty
much
the
same
rate
of
well
i
ought
rather
to
say
that
the
average
man
of
letters
would
be
able
to
do
that
as
for
reardon
he
stopped
the
name
had
escaped
him
unawares
reardon
said
marian
looking
up
you
are
speaking
of
him
i
have
betrayed
myself
miss
but
what
does
it
matter
you
have
only
spoken
in
his
i
feared
the
name
might
affect
you
marian
delayed
her
reply
it
is
true
she
said
we
are
not
on
friendly
terms
with
my
cousin
s
family
i
have
never
met
mr
reardon
but
i
shouldn
t
like
you
to
think
that
the
mention
of
his
name
is
disagreeable
to
it
made
me
slightly
uncomfortable
yesterday
the
fact
that
i
am
well
acquainted
with
mrs
edmund
yule
and
that
reardon
is
my
friend
yet
i
didn
t
see
why
that
should
prevent
my
making
your
father
s
surely
not
i
shall
say
nothing
about
it
i
mean
as
you
uttered
the
name
there
was
a
pause
in
the
dialogue
they
had
been
speaking
almost
confidentially
and
marian
seemed
to
become
suddenly
aware
of
an
oddness
in
the
situation
she
turned
towards
the
uphill
path
as
if
thinking
of
resuming
her
walk
you
are
tired
of
standing
still
said
jasper
may
i
walk
back
a
part
of
the
way
with
you
thank
you
i
shall
be
they
went
on
for
a
few
minutes
in
silence
have
you
published
anything
with
your
signature
miss
yule
jasper
at
length
inquired
nothing
i
only
help
father
a
the
silence
that
again
followed
was
broken
this
time
by
marian
when
you
chanced
to
mention
mr
reardon
s
name
she
said
with
a
diffident
smile
in
which
lay
that
suggestion
of
humour
so
delightful
upon
a
woman
s
face
you
were
going
to
say
something
more
about
him
only
that
he
broke
off
and
laughed
now
how
boyish
it
was
wasn
t
it
i
remember
doing
just
the
same
thing
once
when
i
came
home
from
school
and
had
an
exciting
story
to
tell
with
preservation
of
anonymities
of
course
i
blurted
out
a
name
in
the
first
minute
or
two
to
my
father
s
great
amusement
he
told
me
that
i
hadn
t
the
diplomatic
character
i
have
been
trying
to
acquire
it
ever
since
but
why
it
s
one
of
the
essentials
of
success
in
any
kind
of
public
life
and
i
mean
to
succeed
you
know
i
feel
that
i
am
one
of
the
men
who
do
succeed
but
i
beg
your
pardon
you
asked
me
a
question
really
i
was
only
going
to
say
of
reardon
what
i
had
said
before
that
he
hasn
t
the
tact
requisite
for
acquiring
then
i
may
hope
that
it
isn
t
his
marriage
with
my
cousin
which
has
proved
a
fatal
misfortune
in
no
case
replied
milvain
averting
his
look
would
he
have
used
his
and
now
do
you
think
he
has
but
poor
prospects
i
wish
i
could
see
any
chance
of
his
being
estimated
at
his
right
value
it
s
very
hard
to
say
what
is
before
i
knew
my
cousin
amy
when
we
were
children
said
marian
presently
she
gave
promise
of
yes
she
is
and
the
kind
of
woman
to
be
of
help
to
such
a
husband
i
hardly
know
how
to
answer
miss
yule
said
jasper
looking
frankly
at
her
perhaps
i
had
better
say
that
it
s
unfortunate
they
are
marian
cast
down
her
eyes
to
whom
isn
t
it
a
misfortune
pursued
her
companion
poverty
is
the
root
of
all
social
ills
its
existence
accounts
even
for
the
ills
that
arise
from
wealth
the
poor
man
is
a
man
labouring
in
fetters
i
declare
there
is
no
word
in
our
language
which
sounds
so
hideous
to
me
as
shortly
after
this
they
came
to
the
bridge
over
the
railway
line
jasper
looked
at
his
watch
will
you
indulge
me
in
a
piece
of
childishness
he
said
in
less
than
five
minutes
a
london
express
goes
by
i
have
often
watched
it
here
and
it
amuses
me
would
it
weary
you
to
wait
i
should
like
to
she
replied
with
a
laugh
the
line
ran
along
a
deep
cutting
from
either
side
of
which
grew
hazel
bushes
and
a
few
larger
trees
leaning
upon
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
jasper
kept
his
eye
in
the
westward
direction
where
the
gleaming
rails
were
visible
for
more
than
a
mile
suddenly
he
raised
his
finger
you
hear
marian
had
just
caught
the
sound
of
the
train
she
looked
eagerly
and
in
a
few
moments
saw
it
approaching
the
front
of
the
engine
blackened
nearer
and
nearer
coming
on
with
dread
force
and
speed
a
blinding
rush
and
there
burst
against
the
bridge
a
great
volley
of
sunlit
steam
milvain
and
his
companion
ran
to
the
opposite
parapet
but
already
the
whole
train
had
emerged
and
in
a
few
seconds
it
had
disappeared
round
a
sharp
curve
the
leafy
branches
that
grew
out
over
the
line
swayed
violently
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
perturbed
air
if
i
were
ten
years
younger
said
jasper
laughing
i
should
say
that
was
jolly
it
enspirits
me
it
makes
me
feel
eager
to
go
back
and
plunge
into
the
fight
upon
me
it
has
just
the
opposite
effect
fell
from
marian
in
very
low
tones
oh
don
t
say
that
well
it
only
means
that
you
haven
t
had
enough
holiday
yet
i
have
been
in
the
country
more
than
a
week
a
few
days
more
and
i
must
be
off
how
long
do
you
think
of
staying
not
much
more
than
a
week
i
you
are
coming
to
have
tea
with
us
jasper
remarked
a
propos
of
nothing
then
he
returned
to
another
subject
that
was
in
his
thoughts
it
was
by
a
train
like
that
that
i
first
went
up
to
london
not
really
the
first
time
i
mean
when
i
went
to
live
there
seven
years
ago
what
spirits
i
was
in
a
boy
of
eighteen
going
to
live
independently
in
london
think
of
it
you
went
straight
from
school
i
was
for
two
years
at
redmayne
college
after
leaving
wattleborough
grammar
school
then
my
father
died
and
i
spent
nearly
half
a
year
at
home
i
was
meant
to
be
a
teacher
but
the
prospect
of
entering
a
school
by
no
means
appealed
to
me
a
friend
of
mine
was
studying
in
london
for
some
civil
service
so
i
declared
that
i
would
go
and
do
the
same
did
you
succeed
not
i
i
never
worked
properly
for
that
kind
of
thing
i
read
voraciously
and
got
to
know
london
i
might
have
gone
to
the
dogs
you
know
but
by
when
i
had
been
in
london
a
year
a
pretty
clear
purpose
began
to
form
in
me
strange
to
think
that
you
were
growing
up
there
all
the
time
i
may
have
passed
you
in
the
street
now
and
marian
laughed
and
i
did
at
length
see
you
at
the
british
museum
you
they
turned
a
corner
of
the
road
and
came
full
upon
marian
s
father
who
was
walking
in
this
direction
with
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
so
here
you
are
he
exclaimed
looking
at
the
girl
and
for
the
moment
paying
no
attention
to
jasper
i
wondered
whether
i
should
meet
then
more
dryly
how
do
you
do
mr
milvain
in
a
tone
of
easy
indifference
jasper
explained
how
he
came
to
be
accompanying
miss
yule
shall
i
walk
on
with
you
father
marian
asked
scrutinising
his
rugged
features
just
as
you
please
i
don
t
know
that
i
should
have
gone
much
further
but
we
might
take
another
way
jasper
readily
adapted
himself
to
the
wish
he
discerned
in
mr
yule
at
once
he
offered
in
the
most
natural
way
nothing
was
said
on
either
side
about
another
meeting
the
young
man
proceeded
homewards
but
on
arriving
did
not
at
once
enter
the
house
behind
the
garden
was
a
field
used
for
the
grazing
of
horses
he
entered
it
by
the
unfastened
gate
and
strolled
idly
hither
and
thither
now
and
then
standing
to
observe
a
poor
beast
all
skin
and
bone
which
had
presumably
been
sent
here
in
the
hope
that
a
little
more
labour
might
still
be
exacted
from
it
if
it
were
suffered
to
repose
for
a
few
weeks
there
were
sores
upon
its
back
and
legs
it
stood
in
a
fixed
attitude
of
despondency
just
flicking
away
troublesome
flies
with
its
grizzled
tail
it
was
when
he
went
in
maud
was
not
at
home
and
mrs
milvain
tormented
by
a
familiar
headache
kept
her
room
so
jasper
and
dora
sat
down
together
each
had
an
open
book
on
the
table
throughout
the
meal
they
exchanged
only
a
few
words
going
to
play
a
little
jasper
suggested
when
they
had
gone
into
the
if
you
she
sat
down
at
the
piano
whilst
her
brother
lay
on
the
sofa
his
hands
clasped
beneath
his
head
dora
did
not
play
badly
but
an
absentmindedness
which
was
commonly
observable
in
her
had
its
effect
upon
the
music
she
at
length
broke
off
idly
in
the
middle
of
a
passage
and
began
to
linger
on
careless
chords
then
without
turning
her
head
she
asked
were
you
serious
in
what
you
said
about
writing
storybooks
quite
i
see
no
reason
why
you
shouldn
t
do
something
in
that
way
but
i
tell
you
what
when
i
get
back
i
ll
inquire
into
the
state
of
the
market
i
know
a
man
who
was
once
engaged
at
jolly
monk
s
the
chief
publishers
of
that
kind
of
thing
you
know
i
must
look
him
up
what
a
mistake
it
is
to
neglect
any
acquaintance
and
get
some
information
out
of
him
but
it
s
obvious
what
an
immense
field
there
is
for
anyone
who
can
just
hit
the
taste
of
the
new
generation
of
board
school
children
mustn
t
be
too
that
kind
of
thing
is
falling
out
of
date
but
you
d
have
to
cultivate
a
particular
kind
of
vulgarity
there
s
an
idea
i
ll
write
a
paper
on
the
characteristics
of
that
new
generation
it
may
bring
me
a
few
guineas
and
it
would
be
a
help
to
but
what
do
you
know
about
the
subject
asked
dora
doubtfully
what
a
comical
question
it
is
my
business
to
know
something
about
every
subject
or
to
know
where
to
get
the
well
said
dora
after
a
pause
there
s
no
doubt
maud
and
i
ought
to
think
very
seriously
about
the
future
you
are
aware
jasper
that
mother
has
not
been
able
to
save
a
penny
of
her
i
don
t
see
how
she
could
have
done
of
course
i
know
what
you
re
thinking
but
for
me
it
would
have
been
possible
i
don
t
mind
confessing
to
you
that
the
thought
troubles
me
a
little
now
and
then
i
shouldn
t
like
to
see
you
two
going
off
governessing
in
strangers
houses
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
am
very
honestly
working
for
the
end
which
i
am
convinced
will
be
most
profitable
i
shall
not
desert
you
you
needn
t
fear
that
but
just
put
your
heads
together
and
cultivate
your
writing
faculty
suppose
you
could
both
together
earn
about
a
hundred
a
year
in
grub
street
it
would
be
better
than
governessing
wouldn
t
it
you
say
you
don
t
know
what
miss
yule
writes
well
i
know
a
little
more
about
her
than
i
did
yesterday
i
ve
had
an
hour
s
talk
with
her
this
indeed
met
her
down
in
the
leggatt
fields
i
find
she
doesn
t
write
independently
just
helps
her
father
what
the
help
amounts
to
i
can
t
say
there
s
something
very
attractive
about
her
she
quoted
a
line
or
two
of
tennyson
the
first
time
i
ever
heard
a
woman
speak
blank
verse
with
any
kind
of
she
was
walking
alone
yes
on
the
way
back
we
met
old
yule
he
seemed
rather
grumpy
i
thought
i
don
t
think
she
s
the
kind
of
girl
to
make
a
paying
business
of
literature
her
qualities
are
personal
and
it
s
pretty
clear
to
me
that
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
books
by
no
means
agrees
with
her
disposition
possibly
old
yule
is
something
of
a
he
doesn
t
impress
me
very
favourably
do
you
think
you
will
keep
up
their
acquaintance
in
london
can
t
say
i
wonder
what
sort
of
a
woman
that
mother
really
is
can
t
be
so
very
gross
i
should
miss
harrow
knows
nothing
about
her
except
that
she
was
a
quite
uneducated
but
dash
it
by
this
time
she
must
have
got
decent
manners
of
course
there
may
be
other
objections
mrs
reardon
knows
nothing
against
midway
in
the
following
morning
as
jasper
sat
with
a
book
in
the
garden
he
was
surprised
to
see
alfred
yule
enter
by
the
gate
i
thought
began
the
visitor
who
seemed
in
high
spirits
that
you
might
like
to
see
something
i
received
this
he
unfolded
a
london
evening
paper
and
indicated
a
long
letter
from
a
casual
correspondent
it
was
written
by
the
authoress
of
on
the
boards
and
drew
attention
with
much
expenditure
of
witticism
to
the
conflicting
notices
of
that
book
which
had
appeared
in
the
study
jasper
read
the
thing
with
laughing
appreciation
just
what
one
expected
and
i
have
private
letters
on
the
subject
added
mr
yule
there
has
been
something
like
a
personal
conflict
between
fadge
and
the
man
who
looks
after
the
minor
notices
fadge
more
so
charged
the
other
man
with
a
design
to
damage
him
and
the
paper
there
s
talk
of
legal
proceedings
an
immense
joke
he
laughed
in
his
peculiar
croaking
way
do
you
feel
disposed
for
a
turn
along
the
lanes
mr
milvain
by
all
there
s
my
mother
at
the
window
will
you
come
in
for
a
moment
with
a
step
of
quite
unusual
sprightliness
mr
yule
entered
the
house
he
could
talk
of
but
one
subject
and
mrs
milvain
had
to
listen
to
a
laboured
account
of
the
blunder
just
committed
by
the
study
it
was
alfred
s
yule
s
characteristic
that
he
could
do
nothing
lighthandedly
he
seemed
always
to
converse
with
effort
he
took
a
seat
with
stiff
ungainliness
he
walked
with
a
stumbling
or
sprawling
gait
when
he
and
jasper
set
out
for
their
ramble
his
loquacity
was
in
strong
contrast
with
the
taciturn
mood
he
had
exhibited
yesterday
and
the
day
before
he
fell
upon
the
general
aspects
of
contemporary
literature
the
evil
of
the
time
is
the
multiplication
of
ephemerides
hence
a
demand
for
essays
descriptive
articles
fragments
of
criticism
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
supply
of
even
tolerable
work
the
men
who
have
an
aptitude
for
turning
out
this
kind
of
thing
in
vast
quantities
are
enlisted
by
every
new
periodical
with
the
result
that
their
productions
are
ultimately
watered
down
into
worthlessness
well
now
there
s
fadge
years
ago
some
of
fadge
s
work
was
not
without
a
certain
a
certain
conditional
promise
of
of
comparative
merit
but
now
his
writing
in
my
opinion
is
altogether
beneath
consideration
how
rackett
could
be
so
benighted
as
to
give
him
the
study
especially
after
a
man
like
henry
hawkridge
passes
my
comprehension
did
you
read
a
paper
of
his
a
few
months
back
in
the
wayside
a
preposterous
rehabilitation
of
elkanah
settle
ha
ha
that
s
what
such
men
are
driven
to
elkanah
settle
and
he
hadn
t
even
a
competent
acquaintance
with
his
paltry
subject
will
you
credit
that
he
twice
or
thrice
referred
to
settle
s
reply
to
absalom
and
achitophel
by
the
title
of
absalom
transposed
when
every
schoolgirl
knows
that
the
thing
was
called
achitophel
transposed
this
was
monstrous
enough
but
there
was
something
still
more
contemptible
he
positively
i
assure
you
attributed
the
play
of
epsom
wells
to
crowne
i
should
have
presumed
that
every
student
of
even
the
most
trivial
primer
of
literature
was
aware
that
epsom
wells
was
written
by
shadwell
now
if
one
were
to
take
shadwell
for
the
subject
of
a
paper
one
might
very
well
show
how
unjustly
his
name
has
fallen
into
contempt
it
has
often
occurred
to
me
to
do
this
but
shadwell
never
deviates
into
the
sneer
in
my
opinion
is
entirely
unmerited
for
my
own
part
i
put
shadwell
very
high
among
the
dramatists
of
his
time
and
i
think
i
could
show
that
his
absolute
worth
is
by
no
means
inconsiderable
shadwell
has
distinct
vigour
of
dramatic
conception
his
dialogue
and
as
he
talked
the
man
kept
describing
imaginary
geometrical
figures
with
the
end
of
his
he
very
seldom
raised
his
eyes
from
the
ground
and
the
stoop
in
his
shoulders
grew
more
and
more
pronounced
until
at
a
little
distance
one
might
have
taken
him
for
a
hunchback
at
one
point
jasper
made
a
pause
to
speak
of
the
pleasant
wooded
prospect
that
lay
before
them
his
companion
regarded
it
absently
and
in
a
moment
or
two
asked
did
you
ever
come
across
cottle
s
poem
on
the
malvern
hills
no
it
contains
a
couple
of
the
richest
lines
ever
put
into
print
it
needs
the
evidence
of
close
deduction
to
know
that
i
shall
ever
reach
the
top
perfectly
serious
poetry
mind
you
he
barked
in
laughter
impossible
to
interest
him
in
anything
apart
from
literature
yet
one
saw
him
to
be
a
man
of
solid
understanding
and
not
without
perception
of
humour
he
had
read
vastly
his
memory
was
a
literary
cyclopaedia
his
failings
obvious
enough
were
the
results
of
a
strong
and
somewhat
pedantic
individuality
ceaselessly
at
conflict
with
unpropitious
circumstances
towards
the
young
man
his
demeanour
varied
between
a
shy
cordiality
and
a
dignified
reserve
which
was
in
danger
of
seeming
pretentious
on
the
homeward
part
of
the
walk
he
made
a
few
discreet
inquiries
regarding
milvain
s
literary
achievements
and
prospects
and
the
frank
of
the
replies
appeared
to
interest
him
but
he
expressed
no
desire
to
number
jasper
among
his
acquaintances
in
town
and
of
his
own
professional
or
private
concerns
he
said
not
a
word
whether
he
could
be
any
use
to
me
or
not
i
don
t
exactly
know
jasper
remarked
to
his
mother
and
sisters
at
dinner
i
suspect
it
s
as
much
as
he
can
do
to
keep
a
footing
among
the
younger
tradesmen
but
i
think
he
might
have
said
he
was
willing
to
help
me
if
he
perhaps
replied
maud
your
large
way
of
talking
made
him
think
any
such
offer
you
have
still
to
learn
said
jasper
that
modesty
helps
a
man
in
no
department
of
modern
life
people
take
you
at
your
own
valuation
it
s
the
men
who
declare
boldly
that
they
need
no
help
to
whom
practical
help
comes
from
all
sides
as
likely
as
not
yule
will
mention
my
name
to
someone
a
young
fellow
who
seems
to
see
his
way
pretty
clear
before
the
other
man
will
repeat
it
to
somebody
else
a
young
fellow
whose
way
is
clear
before
him
and
so
i
come
to
the
ears
of
a
man
who
thinks
just
the
fellow
i
want
i
must
look
him
up
and
ask
him
if
he
ll
do
a
but
i
should
like
to
see
these
yules
at
home
i
must
fish
for
an
in
the
afternoon
miss
harrow
and
marian
came
at
the
expected
hour
jasper
purposely
kept
out
of
the
way
until
he
was
summoned
to
the
the
milvain
girls
were
so
far
from
effusive
even
towards
old
acquaintances
that
even
the
people
who
knew
them
best
spoke
of
them
as
rather
cold
and
perhaps
a
trifle
condescending
there
were
people
in
wattleborough
who
declared
their
airs
of
superiority
ridiculous
and
insufferable
the
truth
was
that
nature
had
endowed
them
with
a
larger
share
of
brains
than
was
common
in
their
circle
and
had
added
that
touch
of
pride
which
harmonised
so
ill
with
the
restrictions
of
poverty
their
life
had
a
tone
of
melancholy
the
painful
reserve
which
characterises
a
certain
clearly
defined
class
in
the
present
day
had
they
been
born
twenty
years
earlier
the
children
of
that
veterinary
surgeon
would
have
grown
up
to
a
very
different
and
in
all
probability
a
much
happier
existence
for
their
education
would
have
been
limited
to
the
strictly
needful
and
certainly
in
the
case
of
the
girls
nothing
would
have
encouraged
them
to
look
beyond
the
simple
life
possible
to
a
poor
man
s
offspring
but
whilst
maud
and
dora
were
still
with
their
homely
schoolmistress
wattleborough
saw
fit
to
establish
a
girls
high
school
and
the
moderateness
of
the
fees
enabled
these
sisters
to
receive
an
intellectual
training
wholly
incompatible
with
the
material
conditions
of
their
life
to
the
relatively
poor
who
are
so
much
worse
off
than
the
poor
absolutely
education
is
in
most
cases
a
mocking
cruelty
the
burden
of
their
brother
s
support
made
it
very
difficult
for
maud
and
dora
even
to
dress
as
became
their
intellectual
station
amusements
holidays
the
purchase
of
such
simple
luxuries
as
were
all
but
indispensable
to
them
could
not
be
thought
of
it
resulted
that
they
held
apart
from
the
society
which
would
have
welcomed
them
for
they
could
not
bear
to
receive
without
offering
in
turn
the
necessity
of
giving
lessons
galled
them
they
felt
and
with
every
reason
that
it
made
their
position
ambiguous
so
that
though
they
could
not
help
knowing
many
people
they
had
no
intimates
they
encouraged
no
one
to
visit
them
and
visited
other
houses
as
little
as
might
be
in
marian
yule
they
divined
a
sympathetic
nature
she
was
unlike
any
girl
with
whom
they
had
hitherto
associated
and
it
was
the
impulse
of
both
to
receive
her
with
unusual
friendliness
the
habit
of
reticence
could
not
be
at
once
overcome
and
marian
s
own
timidity
was
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
free
intercourse
but
jasper
s
conversation
at
tea
helped
to
smooth
the
course
of
things
i
wish
you
lived
anywhere
near
us
dora
said
to
their
visitor
as
the
three
girls
walked
in
the
garden
afterwards
and
maud
echoed
the
wish
it
would
be
very
nice
was
marian
s
reply
i
have
no
friends
of
my
own
age
in
none
not
one
she
was
about
to
add
something
but
in
the
end
kept
silence
you
seem
to
get
along
with
miss
yule
pretty
well
after
all
said
jasper
when
the
family
were
alone
again
did
you
anticipate
anything
else
maud
asked
it
seemed
doubtful
up
at
yule
s
house
well
get
her
to
come
here
again
before
i
go
but
it
s
a
pity
she
doesn
t
play
the
piano
he
added
musingly
for
two
days
nothing
was
seen
of
the
yules
jasper
went
each
afternoon
to
the
stream
in
the
valley
but
did
not
again
meet
marian
in
the
meanwhile
he
was
growing
restless
a
fortnight
always
exhausted
his
capacity
for
enjoying
the
companionship
of
his
mother
and
sisters
and
this
time
he
seemed
anxious
to
get
to
the
end
of
his
holiday
for
all
that
there
was
no
continuance
of
the
domestic
bickering
which
had
begun
whatever
the
reason
maud
behaved
with
unusual
mildness
to
her
brother
and
jasper
in
turn
was
gently
disposed
to
both
the
girls
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
it
was
saturday
he
kept
silence
through
breakfast
and
just
as
all
were
about
to
rise
from
the
table
he
made
a
sudden
announcement
i
shall
go
to
london
this
this
afternoon
all
exclaimed
but
monday
is
your
no
i
shall
go
this
afternoon
by
the
and
he
left
the
room
mrs
milvain
and
the
girls
exchanged
looks
i
suppose
he
thinks
the
sunday
will
be
too
wearisome
said
the
mother
perhaps
so
maud
agreed
carelessly
half
an
hour
later
just
as
dora
was
ready
to
leave
the
house
for
her
engagements
in
wattleborough
her
brother
came
into
the
hall
and
took
his
hat
saying
i
ll
walk
a
little
way
with
you
if
you
don
t
when
they
were
in
the
road
he
asked
her
in
an
offhand
manner
do
you
think
i
ought
to
say
to
the
yules
or
won
t
it
signify
i
should
have
thought
you
would
wish
i
don
t
care
about
it
and
you
see
there
s
been
no
hint
of
a
wish
on
their
part
that
i
should
see
them
in
london
no
i
ll
just
leave
you
to
say
for
but
they
expect
to
see
us
or
you
told
them
you
were
not
going
till
monday
and
you
don
t
know
but
mr
yule
might
mean
to
say
something
well
i
had
rather
he
didn
t
replied
jasper
with
a
laugh
oh
indeed
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
he
laughed
again
i
m
afraid
of
that
girl
no
it
won
t
do
you
understand
that
i
m
a
practical
man
and
i
shall
keep
clear
of
dangers
these
days
of
holiday
idleness
put
all
sorts
of
nonsense
into
one
s
dora
kept
her
eyes
down
and
smiled
ambiguously
you
must
act
as
you
think
fit
she
remarked
at
length
exactly
now
i
ll
turn
back
you
ll
be
with
us
at
dinner
they
parted
but
jasper
did
not
keep
to
the
straight
way
home
first
of
all
he
loitered
to
watch
a
at
work
then
he
turned
into
a
lane
which
led
up
the
hill
on
which
was
john
yule
s
house
even
if
he
had
purposed
making
a
farewell
call
it
was
still
far
too
early
all
he
wanted
to
do
was
to
pass
an
hour
of
the
morning
which
threatened
to
lie
heavy
on
his
hands
so
he
rambled
on
and
went
past
the
house
and
took
the
which
would
lead
him
circuitously
home
again
his
mother
desired
to
speak
to
him
she
was
in
the
in
the
parlour
maud
was
practising
music
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
of
something
i
did
yesterday
jasper
mrs
milvain
began
you
see
my
dear
we
have
been
rather
straitened
lately
and
my
health
you
know
grows
so
uncertain
and
all
things
considered
i
have
been
feeling
very
anxious
about
the
girls
so
i
wrote
to
your
uncle
william
and
told
him
that
i
must
positively
have
that
money
i
must
think
of
my
own
children
before
the
matter
referred
to
was
this
the
deceased
mr
milvain
had
a
brother
who
was
a
struggling
shopkeeper
in
a
midland
town
some
ten
years
ago
william
milvain
on
the
point
of
bankruptcy
had
borrowed
a
hundred
and
seventy
pounds
from
his
brother
in
wattleborough
and
this
debt
was
still
unpaid
for
on
the
death
of
jasper
s
father
repayment
of
the
loan
was
impossible
for
william
and
since
then
it
had
seemed
hopeless
that
the
sum
would
ever
be
recovered
the
poor
shopkeeper
had
a
large
family
and
mrs
milvain
notwithstanding
her
own
position
had
never
felt
able
to
press
him
her
relative
however
often
spoke
of
the
business
and
declared
his
intention
of
paying
whenever
he
could
you
can
t
recover
by
law
now
you
know
said
jasper
but
we
have
a
right
to
the
money
law
or
no
law
he
must
pay
he
will
simply
refuse
and
be
justified
poverty
doesn
t
allow
of
honourable
feeling
any
more
than
of
compassion
i
m
sorry
you
wrote
like
that
you
won
t
get
anything
and
you
might
as
well
have
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
mrs
milvain
was
not
able
to
appreciate
this
characteristic
remark
anxiety
weighed
upon
her
and
she
became
irritable
i
am
obliged
to
say
jasper
that
you
seem
rather
thoughtless
if
it
were
only
myself
i
would
make
any
sacrifice
for
you
but
you
must
remember
now
listen
mother
he
interrupted
laying
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
i
have
been
thinking
about
all
this
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
i
shall
do
my
best
to
ask
you
for
no
more
money
it
may
or
may
not
be
practicable
but
i
ll
have
a
try
so
don
t
worry
if
uncle
writes
that
he
can
t
pay
just
explain
why
you
wrote
and
keep
him
gently
in
mind
of
the
thing
that
s
all
one
doesn
t
like
to
do
brutal
things
if
one
can
avoid
them
you
the
young
man
went
to
the
parlour
and
listened
to
maud
s
music
for
awhile
but
restlessness
again
drove
him
forth
towards
eleven
o
clock
he
was
again
ascending
in
the
direction
of
john
yule
s
house
again
he
had
no
intention
of
calling
but
when
he
reached
the
iron
gates
he
lingered
i
will
by
jove
he
said
within
himself
at
last
just
to
prove
i
have
complete
command
of
myself
it
s
to
be
a
display
of
strength
not
at
the
house
door
he
inquired
for
mr
alfred
yule
that
gentleman
had
gone
in
the
carriage
to
wattleborough
half
an
hour
ago
with
his
brother
miss
yule
yes
she
was
within
jasper
entered
the
waited
a
few
moments
and
marian
appeared
she
wore
a
dress
in
which
milvain
had
not
yet
seen
her
and
it
had
the
effect
of
making
him
regard
her
attentively
the
smile
with
which
she
had
come
towards
him
passed
from
her
face
which
was
perchance
a
little
warmer
of
hue
than
commonly
i
m
sorry
your
father
is
away
miss
yule
jasper
began
in
an
animated
voice
i
wanted
to
say
to
him
i
return
to
london
in
a
few
you
are
going
sooner
than
you
intended
yes
i
feel
i
mustn
t
waste
any
more
time
i
think
the
country
air
is
doing
you
good
you
certainly
look
better
than
when
i
passed
you
that
first
i
feel
better
my
sisters
are
anxious
to
see
you
again
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
they
come
up
this
marian
had
seated
herself
on
the
sofa
and
her
hands
were
linked
upon
her
lap
in
the
same
way
as
when
jasper
spoke
with
her
here
before
the
palms
downward
the
beautiful
outline
of
her
bent
head
was
relieved
against
a
broad
strip
of
sunlight
on
the
wall
behind
her
they
deplore
he
continued
in
a
moment
that
they
should
come
to
know
you
only
to
lose
you
again
so
soon
i
have
quite
as
much
reason
to
be
sorry
she
answered
looking
at
him
with
the
slightest
possible
smile
but
perhaps
they
will
let
me
write
to
them
and
hear
from
them
now
and
they
would
think
it
an
honour
country
girls
are
not
often
invited
to
correspond
with
literary
ladies
in
he
said
it
with
as
much
jocoseness
as
civility
allowed
then
at
once
rose
father
will
be
very
sorry
marian
began
with
one
quick
glance
towards
the
window
and
then
another
towards
the
door
perhaps
he
might
possibly
be
able
to
see
you
before
you
go
jasper
stood
in
hesitation
there
was
a
look
on
the
girl
s
face
which
under
other
circumstances
would
have
suggested
a
ready
answer
i
mean
she
added
hastily
he
might
just
call
or
even
see
you
at
the
station
oh
i
shouldn
t
like
to
give
mr
yule
any
trouble
it
s
my
own
fault
for
deciding
to
go
i
shall
leave
by
the
he
offered
his
hand
i
shall
look
for
your
name
in
the
magazines
miss
oh
i
don
t
think
you
will
ever
find
it
he
laughed
incredulously
shook
hands
with
her
a
second
time
and
strode
out
of
the
room
head
erect
feeling
proud
of
himself
when
dora
came
home
at
he
informed
her
of
what
he
had
done
a
very
interesting
girl
he
added
impartially
i
advise
you
to
make
a
friend
of
her
who
knows
but
you
may
live
in
london
some
day
and
then
she
might
be
valuable
morally
i
mean
for
myself
i
shall
do
my
best
not
to
see
her
again
for
a
long
time
she
s
jasper
was
unaccompanied
when
he
went
to
the
station
whilst
waiting
on
the
platform
he
suffered
from
apprehension
lest
alfred
yule
s
seamed
visage
should
present
itself
but
no
acquaintance
approached
him
safe
in
the
corner
of
his
carriage
he
smiled
at
the
last
glimpse
of
the
familiar
fields
and
began
to
think
of
something
he
had
decided
to
write
for
the
west
end
chapter
iv
an
author
and
his
wife
eight
flights
of
stairs
consisting
alternately
of
eight
and
nine
steps
amy
had
made
the
calculation
and
wondered
what
was
the
cause
of
this
arrangement
the
ascent
was
trying
but
then
no
one
could
contest
the
respectability
of
the
abode
in
the
flat
immediately
beneath
resided
a
successful
musician
whose
carriage
and
pair
came
at
a
regular
hour
each
afternoon
to
take
him
and
his
wife
for
a
most
respectable
drive
in
this
special
building
no
one
else
seemed
at
present
to
keep
a
carriage
but
all
the
tenants
were
gentlefolk
and
as
to
living
up
at
the
very
top
why
there
were
distinct
advantages
as
so
many
people
of
moderate
income
are
nowadays
hastening
to
discover
the
noise
from
the
street
was
diminished
at
this
height
no
possible
tramplers
could
establish
themselves
above
your
head
the
air
was
bound
to
be
purer
than
that
of
inferior
strata
finally
one
had
the
flat
roof
whereon
to
sit
or
expatiate
in
sunny
weather
true
that
a
gentle
rain
of
soot
was
wont
to
interfere
with
one
s
comfort
out
there
in
the
open
but
such
minutiae
are
easily
forgotten
in
the
fervour
of
domestic
description
it
was
undeniable
that
on
a
fine
day
one
enjoyed
extensive
views
the
green
ridge
from
hampstead
to
highgate
with
primrose
hill
and
the
foliage
of
regent
s
park
in
the
foreground
the
suburban
spaces
of
st
john
s
wood
maida
vale
kilburn
westminster
abbey
and
the
houses
of
parliament
lying
low
by
the
side
of
the
hidden
river
and
a
glassy
gleam
on
hills
which
meant
the
crystal
palace
then
the
clouded
majesty
of
eastern
london
crowned
by
st
paul
s
dome
these
things
one
s
friends
were
expected
to
admire
sunset
often
afforded
rich
effects
but
they
were
for
solitary
musing
a
a
bedroom
a
kitchen
but
the
kitchen
was
called
or
even
parlour
at
need
for
the
lent
itself
to
concealment
behind
an
ornamental
screen
the
walls
displayed
pictures
and
bookcases
and
a
tiny
scullery
which
lay
apart
sufficed
for
the
coarser
domestic
operations
this
was
amy
s
territory
during
the
hours
when
her
husband
was
working
or
endeavouring
to
work
of
necessity
edwin
reardon
used
the
front
room
as
his
study
his
stood
against
the
window
each
wall
had
its
shelves
of
serried
literature
vases
busts
engravings
all
of
the
inexpensive
kind
served
for
ornaments
a
recently
emancipated
from
the
board
school
came
at
seven
each
morning
and
remained
until
two
o
clock
by
which
time
the
reardons
had
dined
on
special
occasions
her
services
were
enlisted
for
later
hours
but
it
was
reardon
s
habit
to
begin
the
serious
work
of
the
day
at
about
three
o
clock
and
to
continue
with
brief
interruptions
until
ten
or
eleven
in
many
respects
an
awkward
arrangement
but
enforced
by
the
man
s
temperament
and
his
poverty
one
evening
he
sat
at
his
desk
with
a
slip
of
manuscript
paper
before
him
it
was
the
hour
of
sunset
his
outlook
was
upon
the
backs
of
certain
large
houses
skirting
regent
s
park
and
lights
had
begun
to
show
here
and
there
in
the
windows
in
one
room
a
man
was
discoverable
dressing
for
dinner
he
had
not
thought
it
worth
while
to
lower
the
blind
in
another
some
people
were
playing
billiards
the
higher
windows
reflected
a
rich
glow
from
the
western
sky
for
two
or
three
hours
reardon
had
been
seated
in
much
the
same
attitude
occasionally
he
dipped
his
pen
into
the
ink
and
seemed
about
to
write
but
each
time
the
effort
was
abortive
at
the
head
of
the
paper
was
inscribed
chapter
but
that
was
all
and
now
the
sky
was
dusking
over
darkness
would
soon
fall
he
looked
something
older
than
his
years
which
were
on
his
face
was
the
pallor
of
mental
suffering
often
he
fell
into
a
fit
of
absence
and
gazed
at
vacancy
with
wide
miserable
eyes
returning
to
consciousness
he
fidgeted
nervously
on
his
chair
dipped
his
pen
for
the
hundredth
time
bent
forward
in
feverish
determination
to
work
useless
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
wished
to
put
into
words
and
his
brain
refused
to
construct
the
simplest
sentence
the
colours
faded
from
the
sky
and
night
came
quickly
reardon
threw
his
arms
upon
the
desk
let
his
head
fall
forward
and
remained
so
as
if
asleep
presently
the
door
opened
and
a
young
clear
voice
made
inquiry
don
t
you
want
the
lamp
edwin
the
man
roused
himself
turned
his
chair
a
little
and
looked
towards
the
open
door
come
here
his
wife
approached
it
was
not
quite
dark
in
the
room
for
a
glimmer
came
from
the
opposite
houses
what
s
the
matter
can
t
you
do
anything
i
haven
t
written
a
word
at
this
rate
one
goes
crazy
come
and
sit
by
me
a
minute
i
ll
get
the
no
come
and
talk
to
me
we
can
understand
each
other
nonsense
you
have
such
morbid
ideas
i
can
t
bear
to
sit
in
the
at
once
she
went
away
and
quickly
reappeared
with
a
which
she
placed
on
the
square
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
draw
down
the
blind
she
was
a
slender
girl
but
not
very
tall
her
shoulders
seemed
rather
broad
in
proportion
to
her
waist
and
the
part
of
her
figure
below
it
the
hue
of
her
hair
was
ruddy
gold
loosely
arranged
tresses
made
a
superb
crown
to
the
beauty
of
her
small
refined
head
yet
the
face
was
not
of
distinctly
feminine
type
with
short
hair
and
appropriate
clothing
she
would
have
passed
unquestioned
as
a
handsome
boy
of
seventeen
a
spirited
boy
too
and
one
much
in
the
habit
of
giving
orders
to
inferiors
her
nose
would
have
been
perfect
but
for
ever
so
slight
a
crook
which
made
it
preferable
to
view
her
in
full
face
than
in
profile
her
lips
curved
sharply
out
and
when
she
straightened
them
of
a
sudden
the
effect
was
not
reassuring
to
anyone
who
had
counted
upon
her
for
facile
humour
in
harmony
with
the
broad
shoulders
she
had
a
strong
neck
as
she
bore
the
lamp
into
the
room
a
slight
turn
of
her
head
showed
splendid
muscles
from
the
ear
downward
it
was
a
magnificently
bust
one
thought
in
looking
at
her
of
the
head
which
some
honest
sculptor
has
wrought
with
his
own
hand
from
the
marble
block
there
was
a
suggestion
of
planes
and
of
the
chisel
the
atmosphere
was
cold
ruddiness
would
have
been
quite
out
of
place
on
her
cheeks
and
a
flush
must
have
been
the
rarest
thing
there
her
age
was
not
quite
she
had
been
wedded
nearly
two
years
and
had
a
child
ten
months
old
as
for
her
dress
it
was
unpretending
in
fashion
and
colour
but
of
admirable
fit
every
detail
of
her
appearance
denoted
scrupulous
personal
refinement
she
walked
well
you
saw
that
the
foot
however
gently
was
firmly
planted
when
she
seated
herself
her
posture
was
instantly
graceful
and
that
of
one
who
is
indifferent
about
support
for
the
back
what
is
the
matter
she
began
why
can
t
you
get
on
with
the
story
it
was
the
tone
of
friendly
remonstrance
not
exactly
of
affection
not
at
all
of
tender
solicitude
reardon
had
risen
and
wished
to
approach
her
but
could
not
do
so
directly
he
moved
to
another
part
of
the
room
then
came
round
to
the
back
of
her
chair
and
bent
his
face
upon
her
shoulder
amy
i
think
it
s
all
over
with
me
i
don
t
think
i
shall
write
any
don
t
be
so
foolish
dear
what
is
to
prevent
your
writing
perhaps
i
am
only
out
of
sorts
but
i
begin
to
be
horribly
afraid
my
will
seems
to
be
fatally
weakened
i
can
t
see
my
way
to
the
end
of
anything
if
i
get
hold
of
an
idea
which
seems
good
all
the
sap
has
gone
out
of
it
before
i
have
got
it
into
working
shape
in
these
last
few
months
i
must
have
begun
a
dozen
different
books
i
have
been
ashamed
to
tell
you
of
each
new
beginning
i
write
twenty
pages
perhaps
and
then
my
courage
fails
i
am
disgusted
with
the
thing
and
can
t
go
on
with
it
can
t
my
fingers
refuse
to
hold
the
pen
in
mere
writing
i
have
done
enough
to
make
much
more
than
three
volumes
but
it
s
all
because
of
your
morbid
conscientiousness
there
was
no
need
to
destroy
what
you
had
written
it
was
all
good
enough
for
the
don
t
use
that
word
amy
i
hate
it
you
can
t
afford
to
hate
it
was
her
rejoinder
in
very
practical
tones
however
it
was
before
you
must
write
for
the
market
now
you
have
admitted
that
he
kept
silence
where
are
you
she
went
on
to
ask
what
have
you
actually
done
two
short
chapters
of
a
story
i
can
t
go
on
with
the
three
volumes
lie
before
me
like
an
interminable
desert
impossible
to
get
through
them
the
idea
is
stupidly
artificial
and
i
haven
t
a
living
character
in
the
public
don
t
care
whether
the
characters
are
living
or
don
t
stand
behind
me
like
that
it
s
such
an
awkward
way
of
talking
come
and
sit
he
drew
away
and
came
to
a
position
whence
he
could
see
her
face
but
kept
at
a
distance
yes
he
said
in
a
different
way
that
s
the
worst
of
what
is
that
you
well
it
s
no
that
i
what
she
did
not
look
at
him
her
lips
after
she
had
spoken
drew
in
a
little
that
your
disposition
towards
me
is
being
affected
by
this
miserable
failure
you
keep
saying
to
yourself
that
i
am
not
what
you
thought
me
perhaps
you
even
feel
that
i
have
been
guilty
of
a
sort
of
deception
i
don
t
blame
you
it
s
natural
i
ll
tell
you
quite
honestly
what
i
do
think
she
replied
after
a
short
silence
you
are
much
weaker
than
i
imagined
difficulties
crush
you
instead
of
rousing
you
to
true
it
has
always
been
my
but
don
t
you
feel
it
s
rather
unmanly
this
state
of
things
you
say
you
love
me
and
i
try
to
believe
it
but
whilst
you
are
saying
so
you
let
me
get
nearer
and
nearer
to
miserable
hateful
poverty
what
is
to
become
of
me
of
us
shall
you
sit
here
day
after
day
until
our
last
shilling
is
spent
no
of
course
i
must
do
when
shall
you
begin
in
earnest
in
a
day
or
two
you
must
pay
this
quarter
s
rent
and
that
will
leave
us
just
about
fifteen
pounds
in
the
world
where
is
the
rent
at
christmas
to
come
from
what
are
we
to
live
upon
there
s
all
sorts
of
clothing
to
be
bought
there
ll
be
all
the
extra
expenses
of
winter
surely
it
s
bad
enough
that
we
have
had
to
stay
here
all
the
summer
no
holiday
of
any
kind
i
have
done
my
best
not
to
grumble
about
it
but
i
begin
to
think
that
it
would
be
very
much
wiser
if
i
did
she
squared
her
shoulders
and
gave
her
head
just
a
little
shake
as
if
a
fly
had
troubled
her
you
bear
everything
very
well
and
kindly
said
reardon
my
behaviour
is
contemptible
i
know
that
good
heavens
if
i
only
had
some
business
to
go
to
something
i
could
work
at
in
any
state
of
mind
and
make
money
out
of
given
this
chance
i
would
work
myself
to
death
rather
than
you
should
lack
anything
you
desire
but
i
am
at
the
mercy
of
my
brain
it
is
dry
and
powerless
how
i
envy
those
clerks
who
go
by
to
their
offices
in
the
morning
there
s
the
day
s
work
cut
out
for
them
no
question
of
mood
and
feeling
they
have
just
to
work
at
something
and
when
the
evening
comes
they
have
earned
their
wages
they
are
free
to
rest
and
enjoy
themselves
what
an
insane
thing
it
is
to
make
literature
one
s
only
means
of
support
when
the
most
trivial
accident
may
at
any
time
prove
fatal
to
one
s
power
of
work
for
weeks
or
months
no
that
is
the
unpardonable
sin
to
make
a
trade
of
an
art
i
am
rightly
served
for
attempting
such
a
brutal
he
turned
away
in
a
passion
of
misery
how
very
silly
it
is
to
talk
like
this
came
in
amy
s
voice
clearly
critical
art
must
be
practised
as
a
trade
at
all
events
in
our
time
this
is
the
age
of
trade
of
course
if
one
refuses
to
be
of
one
s
time
and
yet
hasn
t
the
means
to
live
independently
what
can
result
but
breakdown
and
wretchedness
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
you
could
do
fairly
good
work
and
work
which
would
sell
if
only
you
would
bring
yourself
to
look
at
things
in
a
more
practical
way
it
s
what
mr
milvain
is
always
saying
you
milvain
s
temperament
is
very
different
from
mine
he
is
naturally
and
hopeful
i
am
naturally
the
opposite
what
you
and
he
say
is
true
enough
the
misfortune
is
that
i
can
t
act
upon
it
i
am
no
uncompromising
artistic
pedant
i
am
quite
willing
to
try
and
do
the
kind
of
work
that
will
sell
under
the
circumstances
it
would
be
a
kind
of
insanity
if
i
refused
but
power
doesn
t
answer
to
the
will
my
efforts
are
utterly
vain
i
suppose
the
prospect
of
pennilessness
is
itself
a
hindrance
the
fear
haunts
me
with
such
terrible
real
things
pressing
upon
me
my
imagination
can
shape
nothing
substantial
when
i
have
laboured
out
a
story
i
suddenly
see
it
in
a
light
of
such
contemptible
triviality
that
to
work
at
it
is
an
impossible
you
are
ill
that
s
the
fact
of
the
matter
you
ought
to
have
had
a
holiday
i
think
even
now
you
had
better
go
away
for
a
week
or
two
do
edwin
impossible
it
would
be
the
merest
pretence
of
holiday
to
go
away
and
leave
you
here
no
shall
i
ask
mother
or
jack
to
lend
us
some
money
that
would
be
but
this
state
of
things
is
intolerable
reardon
walked
the
length
of
the
room
and
back
again
your
mother
has
no
money
to
lend
dear
and
your
brother
would
do
it
so
unwillingly
that
we
can
t
lay
ourselves
under
such
an
yet
it
will
come
to
that
you
know
remarked
amy
calmly
no
it
shall
not
come
to
that
i
must
and
will
get
something
done
long
before
christmas
if
only
you
he
came
and
took
one
of
her
hands
if
only
you
will
give
me
more
sympathy
dearest
you
see
that
s
one
side
of
my
weakness
i
am
utterly
dependent
upon
you
your
kindness
is
the
breath
of
life
to
me
don
t
refuse
it
but
i
have
done
nothing
of
the
you
begin
to
speak
very
coldly
and
i
understand
your
feeling
of
disappointment
the
mere
fact
of
your
urging
me
to
do
anything
that
will
sell
is
a
proof
of
bitter
disappointment
you
would
have
looked
with
scorn
at
anyone
who
talked
to
me
like
that
two
years
ago
you
were
proud
of
me
because
my
work
wasn
t
altogether
common
and
because
i
had
never
written
a
line
that
was
meant
to
attract
the
vulgar
all
that
s
over
now
if
you
knew
how
dreadful
it
is
to
see
that
you
have
lost
your
hopes
of
me
well
but
i
haven
t
altogether
amy
replied
meditatively
i
know
very
well
that
if
you
had
a
lot
of
money
you
would
do
better
things
than
thank
you
a
thousand
times
for
saying
that
my
but
you
see
we
haven
t
money
and
there
s
little
chance
of
our
getting
any
that
scrubby
old
uncle
won
t
leave
anything
to
us
i
feel
too
sure
of
it
i
often
feel
disposed
to
go
and
beg
him
on
my
knees
to
think
of
us
in
his
she
laughed
i
suppose
it
s
impossible
and
would
be
useless
but
i
should
be
capable
of
it
if
i
knew
it
would
bring
reardon
said
nothing
i
didn
t
think
so
much
of
money
when
we
were
married
amy
continued
i
had
never
seriously
felt
the
want
of
it
you
know
i
did
think
there
s
no
harm
in
confessing
it
that
you
were
sure
to
be
rich
some
day
but
i
should
have
married
you
all
the
same
if
i
had
known
that
you
would
win
only
you
are
sure
of
that
well
i
think
so
but
i
know
the
value
of
money
better
now
i
know
it
is
the
most
powerful
thing
in
the
world
if
i
had
to
choose
between
a
glorious
reputation
with
poverty
and
a
contemptible
popularity
with
wealth
i
should
choose
the
no
i
perhaps
you
are
he
turned
away
with
a
sigh
yes
you
are
right
what
is
reputation
if
it
is
deserved
it
originates
with
a
few
score
of
people
among
the
many
millions
who
would
never
have
recognised
the
merit
they
at
last
applaud
that
s
the
lot
of
a
great
genius
as
for
a
mediocrity
like
me
what
ludicrous
absurdity
to
fret
myself
in
the
hope
that
folks
will
say
i
am
above
the
average
after
all
is
there
sillier
vanity
than
this
a
year
after
i
have
published
my
last
book
i
shall
be
practically
forgotten
ten
years
later
i
shall
be
as
absolutely
forgotten
as
one
of
those
novelists
of
the
early
part
of
this
century
whose
names
one
doesn
t
even
recognise
what
fatuous
posing
amy
looked
askance
at
him
but
replied
nothing
and
yet
he
continued
of
course
it
isn
t
only
for
the
sake
of
reputation
that
one
tries
to
do
uncommon
work
there
s
the
shrinking
from
conscious
insincerity
of
workmanship
which
most
of
the
writers
nowadays
seem
never
to
feel
it
s
good
enough
for
the
market
that
satisfies
them
and
perhaps
they
are
justified
i
can
t
pretend
that
i
rule
my
life
by
absolute
ideals
i
admit
that
everything
is
relative
there
is
no
such
thing
as
goodness
or
badness
in
the
absolute
sense
of
course
perhaps
i
am
absurdly
inconsistent
when
though
knowing
my
work
can
t
be
first
rate
i
strive
to
make
it
as
good
as
possible
i
don
t
say
this
in
irony
amy
i
really
mean
it
it
may
very
well
be
that
i
am
just
as
foolish
as
the
people
i
ridicule
for
moral
and
religious
superstition
this
habit
of
mine
is
superstitious
how
well
i
can
imagine
the
answer
of
some
popular
novelist
if
he
heard
me
speak
scornfully
of
his
books
my
dear
fellow
he
might
say
do
you
suppose
i
am
not
aware
that
my
books
are
rubbish
i
know
it
just
as
well
as
you
do
but
my
vocation
is
to
live
comfortably
i
have
a
luxurious
house
a
wife
and
children
who
are
happy
and
grateful
to
me
for
their
happiness
if
you
choose
to
live
in
a
garret
and
what
s
worse
make
your
wife
and
children
share
it
with
you
that
s
your
the
man
would
be
abundantly
but
said
amy
why
should
you
assume
that
his
books
are
rubbish
good
work
succeeds
now
and
i
speak
of
the
common
kind
of
success
which
is
never
due
to
literary
merit
and
if
i
speak
bitterly
well
i
am
suffering
from
my
powerlessness
i
am
a
failure
my
poor
girl
and
it
isn
t
easy
for
me
to
look
with
charity
on
the
success
of
men
who
deserved
it
far
less
than
i
did
when
i
was
still
able
to
of
course
edwin
if
you
make
up
your
mind
that
you
are
a
failure
you
will
end
by
being
so
but
i
m
convinced
there
s
no
reason
that
you
should
fail
to
make
a
living
with
your
pen
now
let
me
advise
you
put
aside
all
your
strict
ideas
about
what
is
worthy
and
what
is
unworthy
and
just
act
upon
my
advice
it
s
impossible
for
you
to
write
a
novel
very
well
then
do
a
short
story
of
a
kind
that
s
likely
to
be
popular
you
know
mr
milvain
is
always
saying
that
the
long
novel
has
had
its
day
and
that
in
future
people
will
write
shilling
books
why
not
try
give
yourself
a
week
to
invent
a
sensational
plot
and
then
a
fortnight
for
the
writing
have
it
ready
for
the
new
season
at
the
end
of
october
if
you
like
don
t
put
your
name
to
it
your
name
certainly
would
have
no
weight
with
this
sort
of
public
just
make
it
a
matter
of
business
as
mr
milvain
says
and
see
if
you
can
t
earn
some
he
stood
and
regarded
her
his
expression
was
one
of
pained
perplexity
you
mustn
t
forget
amy
that
it
needs
a
particular
kind
of
faculty
to
write
stories
of
this
sort
the
invention
of
a
plot
is
just
the
thing
i
find
most
but
the
plot
may
be
as
silly
as
you
like
providing
it
holds
the
attention
of
vulgar
readers
think
of
the
hollow
statue
what
could
be
more
idiotic
yet
it
sells
by
i
don
t
think
i
can
bring
myself
to
that
reardon
said
in
a
low
voice
very
well
then
will
you
tell
me
what
you
propose
to
do
i
might
perhaps
manage
a
novel
in
two
volumes
instead
of
he
seated
himself
at
the
and
stared
at
the
blank
sheets
of
paper
in
an
anguish
of
hopelessness
it
will
take
you
till
christmas
said
amy
and
then
you
will
get
perhaps
fifty
pounds
for
i
must
do
my
best
i
ll
go
out
and
try
to
get
some
ideas
i
he
broke
off
and
looked
steadily
at
his
wife
what
is
it
she
asked
suppose
i
were
to
propose
to
you
to
leave
this
flat
and
take
cheaper
rooms
he
uttered
it
in
a
shamefaced
way
his
eyes
falling
amy
kept
silence
we
might
sublet
it
he
continued
in
the
same
tone
for
the
last
year
of
the
and
where
do
you
propose
to
live
amy
inquired
coldly
there
s
no
need
to
be
in
such
a
dear
neighbourhood
we
could
go
to
one
of
the
outer
districts
one
might
find
three
unfurnished
rooms
for
about
a
week
less
than
half
our
rent
you
must
do
as
seems
good
to
for
heaven
s
sake
amy
don
t
speak
to
me
in
that
way
i
can
t
stand
that
surely
you
can
see
that
i
am
driven
to
think
of
every
possible
resource
to
speak
like
that
is
to
abandon
me
say
you
can
t
or
won
t
do
it
but
don
t
treat
me
as
if
you
had
no
share
in
my
miseries
she
was
touched
for
the
moment
i
didn
t
mean
to
speak
unkindly
dear
but
think
what
it
means
to
give
up
our
home
and
position
that
is
open
confession
of
failure
it
would
be
i
won
t
think
of
it
i
have
three
months
before
christmas
and
i
will
finish
a
book
i
really
can
t
see
why
you
shouldn
t
just
do
a
certain
number
of
pages
every
day
good
or
bad
never
mind
let
the
pages
be
finished
now
you
have
got
two
chapters
no
that
won
t
do
i
must
think
of
a
better
amy
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
there
you
are
what
does
the
subject
matter
get
this
book
finished
and
sold
and
then
do
something
better
next
give
me
just
to
think
perhaps
one
of
the
old
stories
i
have
thrown
aside
will
come
back
in
a

light
i

go
out
for
an
hour
you
don
t
mind
being
left
alone
you
mustn
t
think
of
such
trifles
as
but
nothing
that
concerns
you
in
the
slightest
way
is
a
trifle
to
me
nothing
i
can

that
you
should

darling
a
little
he
knelt
by
her
and
looked
up
into
her
face
say
only
one
or
two
kind
words
like
you
used
to
she
passed
her
hand
lightly
over
his
hair
and
murmured
something
with
a
faint
smile
then
reardon
took
his
hat
and
stick
and
descended
the
eight
flights
of
stone
steps
and
walked
in
the
darkness
round
the
outer
circle
of
regent
s
park
racking
his
fagged
brain
in
a
hopeless
search
for
characters
situations
motives
chapter
the
way
hither
even
in
of
his
marriage
month
he
had
foreseen
this
possibility
but
fate
had
hitherto
rescued
him
in
sudden
ways
when
he
was
on
the
brink
of
and
it
was
hard
to
imagine
that
this
culmination
of
triumphant
joy
could
be
a
preface
to
base
miseries
he
was
the
son
of
a
man
who
had
followed
many
different
pursuits
and
in
none
had
done
much
more
than
earn
a
livelihood
at
the
age
of
forty
when
edwin
his
only
child
was
ten
years
old
mr
reardon
established
himself
in
the
town
of
hereford
as
a
photographer
and
there
he
abode
until
his
death
nine
years
after
occasionally
risking
some
speculation
not
inconsistent
with
the
photographic
business
but
always
with
the
result
of
losing
the
little
capital
he
ventured
mrs
reardon
died
when
edwin
had
reached
his
fifteenth
year
in
breeding
and
education
she
was
superior
to
her
husband
to
whom
moreover
she
had
brought
something
between
four
and
five
hundred
pounds
her
temper
was
passionate
in
both
senses
of
the
word
and
the
marriage
could
hardly
be
called
a
happy
one
though
it
was
never
disturbed
by
serious
discord
the
photographer
was
a
man
of
whims
and
idealisms
his
wife
had
a
strong
vein
of
worldly
ambition
they
made
few
friends
and
it
was
mrs
reardon
s
frequently
expressed
desire
to
go
and
live
in
london
where
fortune
she
thought
might
be
kinder
to
them
reardon
had
all
but
made
up
his
mind
to
try
this
venture
when
he
suddenly
became
a
widower
after
that
he
never
summoned
energy
to
embark
on
new
enterprises
the
boy
was
educated
at
an
excellent
local
school
at
eighteen
he
had
a
far
better
acquaintance
with
the
ancient
classics
than
most
lads
who
have
been
expressly
prepared
for
a
university
and
thanks
to
an
anglicised
swiss
who
acted
as
an
assistant
in
mr
reardon
s
business
he
not
only
read
french
but
could
talk
it
with
a
certain
haphazard
fluency
these
attainments
however
were
not
of
much
practical
use
the
best
that
could
be
done
for
edwin
was
to
place
him
in
the
office
of
an
estate
agent
his
health
was
indifferent
and
it
seemed
likely
that
exercise
of
which
he
would
have
a
good
deal
under
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
case
might
counteract
the
effects
of
study
too
closely
pursued
at
his
father
s
death
he
came
into
possession
practically
it
was
put
at
his
disposal
at
once
though
he
was
little
more
than
nineteen
of
about
two
hundred
pounds
a
for
five
hundred
had
been
sacrificed
to
exigencies
not
very
long
before
he
had
no
difficulty
in
deciding
how
to
use
this
money
his
mother
s
desire
to
live
in
london
had
in
him
the
force
of
an
inherited
motive
as
soon
as
possible
he
released
himself
from
his
uncongenial
occupations
converted
into
money
all
the
possessions
of
which
he
had
not
immediate
need
and
betook
himself
to
the
metropolis
to
become
a
literary
man
of
course
his
capital
lasted
him
nearly
four
years
for
notwithstanding
his
age
he
lived
with
painful
economy
the
strangest
life
of
almost
absolute
loneliness
from
a
certain
point
of
tottenham
court
road
there
is
visible
a
certain
garret
window
in
a
certain
street
which
runs
parallel
with
that
thoroughfare
for
the
greater
part
of
these
four
years
the
garret
in
question
was
reardon
s
home
he
paid
only
a
week
for
the
privilege
of
living
there
his
food
cost
him
about
a
shilling
a
day
on
clothing
and
other
unavoidable
expenses
he
laid
out
some
five
pounds
yearly
then
he
bought
books
volumes
which
cost
anything
between
twopence
and
two
shillings
further
than
that
he
durst
not
go
a
strange
time
i
assure
you
when
he
had
completed
his
year
he
desired
to
procure
a
reader
s
ticket
for
the
british
museum
now
this
was
not
such
a
simple
matter
as
you
may
suppose
it
was
necessary
to
obtain
the
signature
of
some
respectable
householder
and
reardon
was
acquainted
with
no
such
person
his
landlady
was
a
decent
woman
enough
and
a
payer
of
rates
and
taxes
but
it
would
look
odd
to
say
the
least
of
it
to
present
oneself
in
great
russell
street
armed
with
this
person
s
recommendation
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
take
a
bold
step
to
force
himself
upon
the
attention
of
a
stranger
the
thing
from
which
his
pride
had
always
shrunk
he
wrote
to
a
novelist
a
man
with
whose
works
he
had
some
sympathy
i
am
trying
to
prepare
myself
for
a
literary
career
i
wish
to
study
in
the
of
the
british
museum
but
have
no
acquaintance
to
whom
i
can
refer
in
the
ordinary
way
will
you
help
me
i
mean
in
this
particular
only
that
was
the
substance
of
his
letter
for
reply
came
an
invitation
to
a
house
in
the
with
fear
and
trembling
reardon
answered
the
summons
he
was
so
shabbily
attired
he
was
so
diffident
from
the
habit
of
living
quite
alone
he
was
horribly
afraid
lest
it
should
be
supposed
that
he
looked
for
other
assistance
than
he
had
requested
well
the
novelist
was
a
rotund
and
jovial
man
his
dwelling
and
his
person
smelt
of
money
he
was
so
happy
himself
that
he
could
afford
to
be
kind
to
others
have
you
published
anything
he
inquired
for
the
young
man
s
letter
had
left
this
uncertain
nothing
i
have
tried
the
magazines
but
as
yet
without
but
what
do
you
write
chiefly
essays
on
literary
i
can
understand
that
you
would
find
a
difficulty
in
disposing
of
them
that
kind
of
thing
is
supplied
either
by
men
of
established
reputation
or
by
anonymous
writers
who
have
a
regular
engagement
on
papers
and
magazines
give
me
an
example
of
your
i
have
written
something
lately
about
oh
dear
oh
dear
forgive
me
mr
reardon
my
feelings
were
too
much
for
me
those
names
have
been
my
horror
ever
since
i
was
a
schoolboy
far
be
it
from
me
to
discourage
you
if
your
line
is
to
be
solid
literary
criticism
i
will
only
mention
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
such
work
is
indifferently
paid
and
in
very
small
demand
it
hasn
t
occurred
to
you
to
try
your
hand
at
fiction
in
uttering
the
word
he
beamed
to
him
it
meant
a
thousand
or
so
a
year
i
am
afraid
i
have
no
talent
for
the
novelist
could
do
no
more
than
grant
his
genial
signature
for
the
specified
purpose
and
add
good
wishes
in
abundance
reardon
went
home
with
his
brain
in
a
whirl
he
had
had
his
first
glimpse
of
what
was
meant
by
literary
success
that
luxurious
study
with
its
shelves
of
books
its
beautiful
pictures
its
warm
fragrant
air
great
heavens
what
might
not
a
man
do
who
sat
at
his
ease
amid
such
surroundings
he
began
to
work
at
the
but
at
the
same
time
he
thought
often
of
the
novelist
s
suggestion
and
before
long
had
written
two
or
three
short
stories
no
editor
would
accept
them
but
he
continued
to
practise
himself
in
that
art
and
by
degrees
came
to
fancy
that
after
all
perhaps
he
had
some
talent
for
fiction
it
was
significant
however
that
no
native
impulse
had
directed
him
to
his
intellectual
temper
was
that
of
the
student
the
scholar
but
strongly
blended
with
a
love
of
independence
which
had
always
made
him
think
with
distaste
of
a
teacher
s
life
the
stories
he
wrote
were
scraps
of
immature
psychology
the
last
thing
a
magazine
would
accept
from
an
unknown
man
his
money
dwindled
and
there
came
a
winter
during
which
he
suffered
much
from
cold
and
hunger
what
a
blessed
refuge
it
was
there
under
the
great
dome
when
he
must
else
have
sat
in
his
windy
garret
with
the
mere
pretence
of
a
fire
the
was
his
true
home
its
warmth
enwrapped
him
kindly
the
peculiar
odour
of
its
atmosphere
at
first
a
cause
of
headache
grew
dear
and
delightful
to
him
but
he
could
not
sit
here
until
his
last
penny
should
be
spent
something
practical
must
be
done
and
practicality
was
not
his
strong
point
friends
in
london
he
had
none
but
for
an
occasional
conversation
with
his
landlady
he
would
scarcely
have
spoken
a
dozen
words
in
a
week
his
disposition
was
the
reverse
of
democratic
and
he
could
not
make
acquaintances
below
his
own
intellectual
level
solitude
fostered
a
sensitiveness
which
to
begin
with
was
extreme
the
lack
of
stated
occupation
encouraged
his
natural
tendency
to
dream
and
procrastinate
and
hope
for
the
improbable
he
was
a
recluse
in
the
midst
of
millions
and
viewed
with
dread
the
necessity
of
going
forth
to
fight
for
daily
food
little
by
little
he
had
ceased
to
hold
any
correspondence
with
his
former
friends
at
hereford
the
only
person
to
whom
he
still
wrote
and
from
whom
he
still
heard
was
his
mother
s
father
an
old
man
who
lived
at
derby
retired
from
the
business
of
a
draper
and
spending
his
last
years
pleasantly
enough
with
a
daughter
who
had
remained
single
edwin
had
always
been
a
favourite
with
his
grandfather
though
they
had
met
only
once
or
twice
during
the
past
eight
years
but
in
writing
he
did
not
allow
it
to
be
understood
that
he
was
in
actual
want
and
he
felt
that
he
must
come
to
dire
extremities
before
he
could
bring
himself
to
beg
assistance
he
had
begun
to
answer
advertisements
but
the
state
of
his
wardrobe
forbade
his
applying
for
any
but
humble
positions
once
or
twice
he
presented
himself
personally
at
offices
but
his
reception
was
so
mortifying
that
death
by
hunger
seemed
preferable
to
a
continuance
of
such
experiences
the
injury
to
his
pride
made
him
savagely
arrogant
for
days
after
the
last
rejection
he
hid
himself
in
his
garret
hating
the
world
he
sold
his
little
collection
of
books
and
of
course
they
brought
only
a
trifling
sum
that
exhausted
he
must
begin
to
sell
his
clothes
and
then
but
help
was
at
hand
one
day
he
saw
it
advertised
in
a
newspaper
that
the
secretary
of
a
hospital
in
the
north
of
london
was
in
need
of
a
clerk
application
was
to
be
made
by
letter
he
wrote
and
two
days
later
to
his
astonishment
received
a
reply
asking
him
to
wait
upon
the
secretary
at
a
certain
hour
in
a
fever
of
agitation
he
kept
the
appointment
and
found
that
his
business
was
with
a
young
man
in
the
very
highest
spirits
who
walked
up
and
down
a
little
office
the
hospital
was
of
the
special
order
a
house
of
no
great
size
and
treated
the
matter
in
hand
as
an
excellent
joke
i
thought
you
know
of
engaging
someone
much
younger
quite
a
lad
in
fact
but
look
there
those
are
the
replies
to
my
he
pointed
to
a
heap
of
five
or
six
hundred
letters
and
laughed
consumedly
impossible
to
read
them
all
you
know
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
fairest
thing
would
be
to
shake
them
together
stick
my
hand
in
and
take
out
one
by
chance
if
it
didn
t
seem
very
promising
i
would
try
a
second
time
but
the
first
letter
was
yours
and
i
thought
the
fair
thing
to
do
was
at
all
events
to
see
you
you
know
the
fact
is
i
am
only
able
to
offer
a
pound
a
i
shall
be
very
glad
indeed
to
take
that
said
reardon
who
was
bathed
in
perspiration
then
what
about
references
and
so
on
proceeded
the
young
man
chuckling
and
rubbing
his
hands
together
the
applicant
was
engaged
he
had
barely
strength
to
walk
home
the
sudden
relief
from
his
miseries
made
him
for
the
first
time
sensible
of
the
extreme
physical
weakness
into
which
he
had
sunk
for
the
next
week
he
was
very
ill
but
he
did
not
allow
this
to
interfere
with
his
new
work
which
was
easily
learnt
and
not
burdensome
he
held
this
position
for
three
years
and
during
that
time
important
things
happened
when
he
had
recovered
from
his
state
of
and
was
living
in
comfort
a
pound
a
week
is
a
very
large
sum
if
you
have
previously
had
to
live
on
ten
shillings
reardon
found
that
the
impulse
to
literary
production
awoke
in
him
more
strongly
than
ever
he
generally
got
home
from
the
hospital
about
six
o
clock
and
the
evening
was
his
own
in
this
leisure
time
he
wrote
a
novel
in
two
volumes
one
publisher
refused
it
but
a
second
offered
to
bring
it
out
on
the
terms
of
half
profits
to
the
author
the
book
appeared
and
was
well
spoken
of
in
one
or
two
papers
but
profits
there
were
none
to
divide
in
the
third
year
of
his
clerkship
he
wrote
a
novel
in
three
volumes
for
this
his
publishers
gave
him
pounds
with
again
a
promise
of
half
the
profits
after
deduction
of
the
sum
advanced
again
there
was
no
pecuniary
success
he
had
just
got
to
work
upon
a
third
book
when
his
grandfather
at
derby
died
and
left
him
four
hundred
pounds
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
recover
his
freedom
four
hundred
pounds
at
the
rate
of
eighty
pounds
a
year
meant
five
years
of
literary
endeavour
in
that
period
he
could
certainly
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
his
destiny
to
live
by
the
pen
in
the
meantime
his
relations
with
the
secretary
of
the
hospital
carter
by
name
had
grown
very
friendly
when
reardon
began
to
publish
books
the
mr
carter
looked
upon
him
with
something
of
awe
and
when
the
literary
man
ceased
to
be
a
clerk
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
association
on
equal
terms
between
him
and
his
former
employer
they
continued
to
see
a
good
deal
of
each
other
and
carter
made
reardon
acquainted
with
certain
of
his
friends
among
whom
was
one
john
yule
an
selfish
young
man
who
had
a
place
in
a
government
office
the
time
of
solitude
had
gone
by
for
reardon
he
began
to
develop
the
power
that
was
in
him
those
two
books
of
his
were
not
of
a
kind
to
win
popularity
they
dealt
with
no
particular
class
of
society
unless
one
makes
a
distinct
class
of
people
who
have
brains
and
they
lacked
local
colour
their
interest
was
almost
purely
psychological
it
was
clear
that
the
author
had
no
faculty
for
constructing
a
story
and
that
pictures
of
active
life
were
not
to
be
expected
of
him
he
could
never
appeal
to
the
multitude
but
strong
characterisation
was
within
his
scope
and
an
intellectual
fervour
appetising
to
a
small
section
of
refined
readers
marked
all
his
best
pages
he
was
the
kind
of
man
who
can
not
struggle
against
adverse
conditions
but
whom
prosperity
warms
to
the
exercise
of
his
powers
anything
like
the
cares
of
responsibility
would
sooner
or
later
harass
him
into
unproductiveness
that
he
should
produce
much
was
in
any
case
out
of
the
question
possibly
a
book
every
two
or
three
years
might
not
prove
too
great
a
strain
upon
his
delicate
mental
organism
but
for
him
to
attempt
more
than
that
would
certainly
be
fatal
to
the
peculiar
merit
of
his
work
of
this
he
was
dimly
conscious
and
on
receiving
his
legacy
he
put
aside
for
nearly
twelve
months
the
new
novel
he
had
begun
to
give
his
mind
a
rest
he
wrote
several
essays
much
maturer
than
those
which
had
formerly
failed
to
find
acceptance
and
two
of
these
appeared
in
magazines
the
money
thus
earned
he
spent
at
a
tailor
s
his
friend
carter
ventured
to
suggest
this
mode
of
outlay
his
third
book
sold
for
fifty
pounds
it
was
a
great
improvement
on
its
predecessors
and
the
reviews
were
generally
favourable
for
the
story
which
followed
on
neutral
ground
he
received
a
hundred
pounds
on
the
strength
of
that
he
spent
six
months
travelling
in
the
south
of
europe
he
returned
to
london
at
and
on
the
second
day
after
his
arrival
befell
an
incident
which
was
to
control
the
rest
of
his
life
busy
with
the
pictures
in
the
grosvenor
gallery
he
heard
himself
addressed
in
a
familiar
voice
and
on
turning
he
was
aware
of
mr
carter
resplendent
in
fashionable
summer
attire
and
accompanied
by
a
young
lady
of
some
charms
reardon
had
formerly
feared
encounters
of
this
kind
too
conscious
of
the
defects
of
his
attire
but
at
present
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
shirk
social
intercourse
he
was
passably
dressed
and
the
of
travel
had
benefited
his
appearance
in
no
slight
degree
carter
presented
him
to
the
young
lady
of
whom
the
novelist
had
already
heard
as
affianced
to
his
friend
whilst
they
stood
conversing
there
approached
two
ladies
evidently
mother
and
daughter
whose
attendant
was
another
of
reardon
s
acquaintances
mr
john
yule
this
gentleman
stepped
briskly
forward
and
welcomed
the
returned
wanderer
let
me
introduce
you
he
said
to
my
mother
and
sister
your
fame
has
made
them
anxious
to
know
reardon
found
himself
in
a
position
of
which
the
novelty
was
embarrassing
but
scarcely
disagreeable
here
were
five
people
grouped
around
him
all
of
whom
regarded
him
unaffectedly
as
a
man
of
importance
for
though
strictly
speaking
he
had
no
fame
at
all
these
persons
had
kept
up
with
the
progress
of
his
small
repute
and
were
all
distinctly
glad
to
number
among
their
acquaintances
an
unmistakable
author
one
too
who
was
fresh
from
italy
and
greece
mrs
yule
a
lady
rather
too
pretentious
in
her
tone
to
be
attractive
to
a
man
of
reardon
s
refinement
hastened
to
assure
him
how
well
his
books
were
known
in
her
house
though
for
the
run
of
ordinary
novels
we
don
t
care
miss
yule
not
at
all
pretentious
in
speech
and
seemingly
reserved
of
disposition
was
good
enough
to
show
frank
interest
in
the
author
as
for
the
poor
author
himself
well
he
merely
fell
in
love
with
miss
yule
at
first
sight
and
there
was
an
end
of
the
matter
a
day
or
two
later
he
made
a
call
at
their
house
in
the
region
of
westbourne
park
it
was
a
small
house
and
rather
showily
than
handsomely
furnished
no
one
after
visiting
it
would
be
astonished
to
hear
that
mrs
edmund
yule
had
but
a
small
income
and
that
she
was
often
put
to
desperate
expedients
to
keep
up
the
gloss
of
easy
circumstances
in
the
gauzy
and
fluffy
and
varnishy
little
reardon
found
a
youngish
gentleman
already
in
conversation
with
the
widow
and
her
daughter
this
proved
to
be
one
mr
jasper
milvain
also
a
man
of
letters
mr
milvain
was
glad
to
meet
reardon
whose
books
he
had
read
with
decided
interest
really
exclaimed
mrs
yule
i
don
t
know
how
it
is
that
we
have
had
to
wait
so
long
for
the
pleasure
of
knowing
you
mr
reardon
if
john
were
not
so
selfish
he
would
have
allowed
us
a
share
in
your
acquaintance
long
ten
weeks
thereafter
miss
yule
became
mrs
reardon
it
was
a
time
of
frantic
exultation
with
the
poor
fellow
he
had
always
regarded
the
winning
of
a
beautiful
and
intellectual
wife
as
the
crown
of
a
successful
literary
career
but
he
had
not
dared
to
hope
that
such
a
triumph
would
be
his
life
had
been
too
hard
with
him
on
the
whole
he
who
hungered
for
sympathy
who
thought
of
a
woman
s
love
as
the
prize
of
mortals
supremely
blessed
had
spent
the
fresh
years
of
his
youth
in
monkish
solitude
now
of
a
sudden
came
friends
and
flattery
ay
and
love
itself
he
was
rapt
to
the
seventh
heaven
indeed
it
seemed
that
the
girl
loved
him
she
knew
that
he
had
but
a
hundred
pounds
or
so
left
over
from
that
little
inheritance
that
his
books
sold
for
a
trifle
that
he
had
no
wealthy
relatives
from
whom
he
could
expect
anything
yet
she
hesitated
not
a
moment
when
he
asked
her
to
marry
him
i
have
loved
you
from
the
how
is
that
possible
he
urged
what
is
there
lovable
in
me
i
am
afraid
of
waking
up
and
finding
myself
in
my
old
garret
cold
and
you
will
be
a
great
i
implore
you
not
to
count
on
that
in
many
ways
i
am
wretchedly
weak
i
have
no
such
confidence
in
then
i
will
have
confidence
for
but
can
you
love
me
for
my
own
sake
love
me
as
a
man
i
love
you
and
the
words
sang
about
him
filled
the
air
with
a
mad
pulsing
of
intolerable
joy
made
him
desire
to
fling
himself
in
passionate
humility
at
her
feet
to
weep
hot
tears
to
cry
to
her
in
insane
worship
he
thought
her
beautiful
beyond
anything
his
heart
had
imagined
her
warm
gold
hair
was
the
rapture
of
his
eyes
and
of
his
reverent
hand
though
slenderly
fashioned
she
was
so
gloriously
strong
not
a
day
of
illness
in
her
life
said
mrs
yule
and
one
could
readily
believe
it
she
spoke
with
such
a
sweet
decision
her
i
love
you
was
a
bond
with
eternity
in
the
simplest
as
in
the
greatest
things
she
saw
his
wish
and
acted
frankly
upon
it
no
pretty
petulance
no
affectation
of
languishing
none
of
the
weaknesses
of
woman
and
so
exquisitely
fresh
in
her
twenty
years
of
maidenhood
with
bright
young
eyes
that
seemed
to
bid
defiance
to
all
the
years
to
come
he
went
about
like
one
dazzled
with
excessive
light
he
talked
as
he
had
never
talked
before
recklessly
exultantly
insolently
in
the
nobler
sense
he
made
friends
on
every
hand
he
welcomed
all
the
world
to
his
bosom
he
felt
the
benevolence
of
a
god
i
love
you
it
breathed
like
music
at
his
ears
when
he
fell
asleep
in
weariness
of
joy
it
awakened
him
on
the
morrow
as
with
a
glorious
ringing
summons
to
renewed
life
delay
why
should
there
be
delay
amy
wished
nothing
but
to
become
his
wife
idle
to
think
of
his
doing
any
more
work
until
he
sat
down
in
the
home
of
which
she
was
mistress
his
brain
burned
with
visions
of
the
books
he
would
henceforth
write
but
his
hand
was
incapable
of
anything
but
a
and
what
letters
reardon
never
published
anything
equal
to
those
i
have
received
your
poem
amy
replied
to
one
of
them
and
she
was
right
not
a
letter
but
a
poem
he
had
sent
her
with
every
word
on
fire
the
hours
of
talk
it
enraptured
him
to
find
how
much
she
had
read
and
with
what
clearness
of
understanding
latin
and
greek
no
ah
but
she
should
learn
them
both
that
there
might
be
nothing
wanting
in
the
communion
between
his
thought
and
hers
for
he
loved
the
old
writers
with
all
his
heart
they
had
been
such
strength
to
him
in
his
days
of
misery
they
would
go
together
to
the
charmed
lands
of
the
south
no
not
now
for
their
marriage
holiday
amy
said
that
would
be
an
imprudent
expense
but
as
soon
as
he
had
got
a
good
price
for
a
book
will
not
the
publishers
be
kind
if
they
knew
what
happiness
lurked
in
embryo
within
their
foolish
he
woke
of
a
sudden
in
the
early
hours
of
one
morning
a
week
before
the
you
know
that
kind
of
awaking
so
complete
in
an
instant
caused
by
the
pressure
of
some
troublesome
thought
upon
the
dreaming
brain
suppose
i
should
not
succeed
henceforth
suppose
i
could
never
get
more
than
this
poor
hundred
pounds
for
one
of
the
long
books
which
cost
me
so
much
labour
i
shall
perhaps
have
children
to
support
and
amy
how
would
amy
bear
poverty
he
knew
what
poverty
means
the
chilling
of
brain
and
heart
the
unnerving
of
the
hands
the
slow
gathering
about
one
of
fear
and
shame
and
impotent
wrath
the
dread
feeling
of
helplessness
of
the
world
s
base
indifference
poverty
poverty
and
for
hours
he
could
not
sleep
his
eyes
kept
filling
with
tears
the
beating
of
his
heart
was
low
and
in
his
solitude
he
called
upon
amy
with
pitiful
entreaty
do
not
forsake
me
i
love
you
i
love
you
but
that
went
by
six
days
five
days
four
days
will
one
s
heart
burst
with
happiness
the
flat
is
taken
is
furnished
up
there
towards
the
sky
eight
flights
of
stone
steps
you
re
a
confoundedly
lucky
fellow
reardon
remarked
milvain
who
had
already
become
very
intimate
with
his
new
friend
a
good
fellow
too
and
you
deserve
but
at
first
i
had
a
horrible
i
guess
what
you
mean
no
i
wasn
t
even
in
love
with
her
though
i
admired
her
she
would
never
have
cared
for
me
in
any
case
i
am
not
sentimental
the
deuce
i
mean
it
in
an
inoffensive
sense
she
and
i
are
rather
too
much
alike
i
how
do
you
mean
asked
reardon
puzzled
and
not
very
well
pleased
there
s
a
great
deal
of
pure
intellect
about
miss
yule
you
know
she
was
sure
to
choose
a
man
of
the
passionate
i
think
you
are
talking
nonsense
my
dear
well
perhaps
i
am
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
by
no
means
completed
my
study
of
women
yet
it
is
one
of
the
things
in
which
i
hope
to
be
a
specialist
some
day
though
i
don
t
think
i
shall
ever
make
use
of
it
in
novels
rather
perhaps
in
three
days
two
days
one
day
now
let
every
joyous
sound
which
the
great
globe
can
utter
ring
forth
in
one
burst
of
harmony
is
it
not
well
done
to
make
the
chant
merrily
when
a
marriage
is
over
here
in
london
we
can
have
no
such
music
but
for
us
my
dear
one
all
the
roaring
life
of
the
great
city
is
sweet
pure
face
under
its
the
face
which
shall
if
fate
spare
it
be
as
dear
to
me
many
a
long
year
hence
as
now
at
the
culminating
moment
of
my
life
as
he
trudged
on
in
the
dark
his
tortured
memory
was
living
through
that
time
again
the
images
forced
themselves
upon
him
however
much
he
tried
to
think
of
quite
other
things
of
some
fictitious
story
on
which
he
might
set
to
work
in
the
case
of
his
earlier
books
he
had
waited
quietly
until
some
suggestive
situation
some
group
of
congenial
characters
came
with
sudden
delightfulness
before
his
mind
and
urged
him
to
write
but
nothing
so
spontaneous
could
now
be
hoped
for
his
brain
was
too
weary
with
months
of
fruitless
harassing
endeavour
moreover
he
was
trying
to
devise
a
plot
the
kind
of
literary
which
might
excite
interest
in
the
mass
of
readers
and
this
was
alien
to
the
natural
working
of
his
imagination
he
suffered
the
torments
of
nightmare
an
oppression
of
the
brain
and
heart
which
must
soon
be
intolerable
chapter
vi
the
practical
friend
when
her
husband
had
set
forth
amy
seated
herself
in
the
study
and
took
up
a
new
library
volume
as
if
to
read
but
she
had
no
real
intention
of
doing
so
it
was
always
disagreeable
to
her
to
sit
in
the
manner
of
one
totally
unoccupied
with
hands
on
lap
and
even
when
she
consciously
gave
herself
up
to
musing
an
open
book
was
generally
before
her
she
did
not
in
truth
read
much
nowadays
since
the
birth
of
her
child
she
had
seemed
to
care
less
than
before
for
disinterested
study
if
a
new
novel
that
had
succeeded
came
into
her
hands
she
perused
it
in
a
very
practical
spirit
commenting
to
reardon
on
the
features
of
the
work
which
had
made
it
popular
formerly
she
would
have
thought
much
more
of
its
purely
literary
merits
for
which
her
eye
was
very
keen
how
often
she
had
given
her
husband
a
thrill
of
exquisite
pleasure
by
pointing
to
some
merit
or
defect
of
which
the
common
reader
would
be
totally
insensible
now
she
spoke
less
frequently
on
such
subjects
her
interests
were
becoming
more
personal
she
liked
to
hear
details
of
the
success
of
popular
authors
about
their
wives
or
husbands
as
the
case
might
be
their
arrangements
with
publishers
their
methods
of
work
the
gossip
columns
of
literary
papers
and
of
some
that
were
not
literary
had
an
attraction
for
her
she
talked
of
questions
such
as
international
copyright
was
anxious
to
get
an
insight
into
the
practical
conduct
of
journals
and
magazines
liked
to
know
who
read
for
the
to
an
impartial
observer
it
might
have
appeared
that
her
intellect
was
growing
more
active
and
mature
more
than
half
an
hour
passed
it
was
not
a
pleasant
train
of
thought
that
now
occupied
her
her
lips
were
drawn
together
her
brows
were
slightly
wrinkled
the
which
at
other
times
was
agreeably
expressed
upon
her
features
had
become
rather
too
cold
and
decided
at
one
moment
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
heard
a
sound
in
the
bedroom
the
doors
were
purposely
left
ajar
and
her
head
turned
quickly
to
listen
the
look
in
her
eyes
instantaneously
softening
but
all
remained
quiet
the
street
would
have
been
silent
but
for
a
cab
that
now
and
then
passed
the
swing
of
a
hansom
or
the
roll
of
a
and
within
the
buildings
nothing
whatever
was
audible
yes
a
footstep
briskly
mounting
the
stone
stairs
not
like
that
of
the
postman
a
visitor
perhaps
to
the
other
flat
on
the
topmost
landing
but
the
final
pause
was
in
this
direction
and
then
came
a
sharp
at
the
door
amy
rose
immediately
and
went
to
open
jasper
milvain
raised
his
urban
silk
hat
then
held
out
his
hand
with
the
greeting
of
frank
friendship
his
inquiries
were
in
so
loud
a
voice
that
amy
checked
him
with
a
forbidding
gesture
you
ll
wake
willie
by
jove
i
always
forget
he
exclaimed
in
subdued
tones
does
the
infant
flourish
oh
yes
reardon
out
i
got
back
on
saturday
evening
but
couldn
t
come
round
before
it
was
monday
how
close
it
is
in
here
i
suppose
the
roof
gets
so
heated
during
the
day
glorious
weather
in
the
country
and
i
ve
no
end
of
things
to
tell
you
he
won
t
be
long
i
suppose
i
think
he
left
his
hat
and
stick
in
the
passage
came
into
the
study
and
glanced
about
as
if
he
expected
to
see
some
change
since
he
was
last
here
three
weeks
ago
so
you
have
been
enjoying
yourself
said
amy
as
after
listening
for
a
moment
at
the
door
she
took
a
seat
oh
a
little
freshening
of
the
faculties
but
whose
acquaintance
do
you
think
i
have
made
down
there
yes
your
uncle
alfred
and
his
daughter
were
staying
at
john
yule
s
and
i
saw
something
of
them
i
was
invited
to
the
did
you
speak
of
us
to
miss
yule
only
i
happened
to
meet
her
on
a
walk
and
in
a
blundering
way
i
mentioned
reardon
s
name
but
of
course
it
didn
t
matter
in
the
least
she
inquired
about
you
with
a
good
deal
of
interest
asked
if
you
were
as
beautiful
as
you
promised
to
be
years
amy
laughed
doesn
t
that
proceed
from
your
fertile
invention
mr
milvain
not
a
bit
of
it
what
would
be
your
natural
question
concerning
her
do
you
think
she
gave
promise
of
good
looks
i
m
afraid
i
can
t
say
that
she
did
she
had
a
good
face
but
rather
i
jasper
threw
back
his
head
and
seemed
to
contemplate
an
object
in
memory
well
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
most
people
called
her
a
trifle
plain
even
now
and
yet
no
that
s
hardly
possible
after
all
she
has
no
colour
wears
her
hair
short
oh
i
don
t
mean
the
smooth
boyish
hair
with
a
parting
not
the
kind
of
hair
that
would
be
lank
if
it
grew
long
curly
all
over
looks
uncommonly
well
i
assure
you
she
has
a
capital
head
odd
girl
very
odd
girl
quiet
thoughtful
not
very
happy
i
m
afraid
seems
to
think
with
dread
of
a
return
to
indeed
but
i
had
understood
that
she
was
a
reading
enough
for
six
people
probably
perhaps
her
health
is
not
very
robust
oh
i
knew
her
by
sight
quite
well
had
seen
her
at
the
she
s
the
kind
of
girl
that
gets
into
one
s
head
you
know
suggestive
much
more
in
her
than
comes
out
until
one
knows
her
very
well
i
should
hope
so
remarked
amy
with
a
peculiar
smile
but
that
s
by
no
means
a
matter
of
course
they
didn
t
invite
me
to
come
and
see
them
in
i
suppose
marian
mentioned
your
acquaintance
with
this
branch
of
the
family
i
think
not
at
all
events
she
promised
me
she
wouldn
amy
looked
at
him
inquiringly
in
a
puzzled
way
she
promised
you
voluntarily
we
got
rather
sympathetic
your
uncle
alfred
i
mean
is
a
remarkable
man
but
i
think
he
regarded
me
as
a
youth
of
no
particular
importance
well
how
do
things
go
amy
shook
her
head
no
progress
none
whatever
he
can
t
work
i
begin
to
be
afraid
that
he
is
really
ill
he
must
go
away
before
the
fine
weather
is
over
do
persuade
him
i
wish
you
could
have
had
a
holiday
with
out
of
the
question
now
i
m
sorry
to
say
i
must
work
savagely
but
can
t
you
all
manage
a
fortnight
somewhere
hastings
eastbourne
it
would
be
simply
rash
one
goes
on
saying
what
does
a
pound
or
two
matter
but
it
begins
at
length
to
matter
a
great
i
know
confound
it
all
think
how
it
would
amuse
some
rich
grocer
s
son
who
pitches
his
to
the
waiter
when
he
has
dined
himself
into
good
humour
but
i
tell
you
what
it
is
you
must
really
try
to
influence
him
towards
practicality
don
t
you
think
he
paused
and
amy
sat
looking
at
her
hands
i
have
made
an
attempt
she
said
at
length
in
a
distant
undertone
you
really
have
jasper
leaned
forward
his
clasped
hands
hanging
between
his
knees
he
was
scrutinising
her
face
and
amy
conscious
of
the
too
fixed
regard
at
length
moved
her
head
uneasily
it
seems
very
clear
to
me
she
said
that
a
long
book
is
out
of
the
question
for
him
at
present
he
writes
so
slowly
and
is
so
fastidious
it
would
be
a
fatal
thing
to
hurry
through
something
weaker
even
than
the
you
think
the
optimist
weak
jasper
asked
half
absently
i
don
t
think
it
worthy
of
edwin
i
don
t
see
how
anyone
can
i
have
wondered
what
your
opinion
was
yes
he
ought
to
try
a
new
tack
i
just
then
there
came
the
sound
of
a
opening
the
outer
door
jasper
lay
back
in
his
chair
and
waited
with
a
smile
for
his
expected
friend
s
appearance
amy
made
no
movement
oh
there
you
are
said
reardon
presenting
himself
with
the
dazzled
eyes
of
one
who
has
been
in
darkness
he
spoke
in
a
voice
of
genial
welcome
though
it
still
had
the
note
of
depression
when
did
you
get
back
milvain
began
to
recount
what
he
had
told
in
the
first
part
of
his
conversation
with
amy
as
he
did
so
the
latter
withdrew
and
was
absent
for
five
minutes
on
reappearing
she
said
you
ll
have
some
supper
with
us
mr
milvain
i
think
i
will
shortly
after
all
repaired
to
the
where
conversation
had
to
be
carried
on
in
a
low
tone
because
of
the
proximity
of
the
bedchamber
in
which
lay
the
sleeping
child
jasper
began
to
tell
of
certain
things
that
had
happened
to
him
since
his
arrival
in
town
it
was
a
curious
coincidence
but
have
you
heard
of
what
the
study
has
been
doing
i
should
rather
think
so
replied
reardon
his
face
lighting
up
with
no
small
delicious
isn
t
it
exclaimed
his
wife
i
thought
it
too
good
to
be
true
when
edwin
heard
of
it
from
mr
all
three
laughed
in
subdued
chorus
for
the
moment
reardon
became
a
new
man
in
his
exultation
over
the
contradictory
reviewers
oh
biffen
told
you
did
he
well
continued
jasper
it
was
an
odd
thing
but
when
i
reached
my
lodgings
on
saturday
evening
there
lay
a
note
from
horace
barlow
inviting
me
to
go
and
see
him
on
sunday
afternoon
out
at
wimbledon
the
special
reason
being
that
the
editor
of
the
study
would
be
there
and
barlow
thought
i
might
like
to
meet
him
now
this
letter
gave
me
a
fit
of
laughter
not
only
because
of
those
precious
reviews
but
because
alfred
yule
had
been
telling
me
all
about
this
same
editor
who
rejoices
in
the
name
of
fadge
your
uncle
mrs
reardon
declares
that
fadge
is
the
most
malicious
man
in
the
literary
profession
though
that
s
saying
such
a
very
great
deal
well
never
mind
of
course
i
was
delighted
to
go
and
meet
fadge
at
barlow
s
i
found
the
queerest
collection
of
people
most
of
them
women
of
the
inkiest
description
the
great
fadge
himself
surprised
me
i
expected
to
see
a
gaunt
bilious
man
and
he
was
the
rosiest
and
dumpiest
little
dandy
you
can
imagine
a
fellow
of
i
dare
say
with
thin
yellow
hair
and
blue
eyes
and
a
manner
of
extreme
innocence
fadge
flattered
me
with
confidential
chat
and
i
discovered
at
length
why
barlow
had
asked
me
to
meet
him
it
s
fadge
that
is
going
to
edit
culpepper
s
new
monthly
you
ve
heard
about
it
and
he
had
actually
thought
it
worth
while
to
enlist
me
among
contributors
now
how
s
that
for
a
piece
of
news
the
speaker
looked
from
reardon
to
amy
with
a
smile
of
vast
significance
i
rejoice
to
hear
it
said
reardon
fervently
you
see
you
see
cried
jasper
forgetting
all
about
the
infant
in
the
next
room
all
things
come
to
the
man
who
knows
how
to
wait
but
i
m
hanged
if
i
expected
a
thing
of
this
kind
to
come
so
soon
why
i
m
a
man
of
distinction
my
doings
have
been
noted
the
admirable
qualities
of
my
style
have
drawn
attention
i
m
looked
upon
as
one
of
the
coming
men
thanks
i
confess
in
some
measure
to
old
barlow
he
seems
to
have
amused
himself
with
cracking
me
up
to
all
and
sundry
that
last
thing
of
mine
in
the
west
end
has
done
me
a
vast
amount
of
good
it
seems
and
alfred
yule
himself
had
noticed
that
paper
in
the
wayside
that
s
how
things
work
you
know
reputation
comes
with
a
burst
just
when
you
re
not
looking
for
anything
of
the
what
s
the
new
magazine
to
be
called
asked
amy
why
they
propose
the
current
not
bad
in
a
way
though
you
imagine
a
fellow
saying
have
you
seen
the
current
current
at
all
events
the
tone
is
to
be
up
to
date
and
the
articles
are
to
be
short
no
padding
merum
sal
from
cover
to
cover
what
do
you
think
i
have
undertaken
to
do
for
a
start
a
paper
consisting
of
sketches
of
typical
readers
of
each
of
the
principal
daily
and
weekly
papers
a
deuced
good
idea
you
know
my
own
of
course
but
deucedly
hard
to
carry
out
i
shall
rise
to
the
occasion
see
if
i
don
t
i
ll
rival
fadge
himself
in
maliciousness
though
i
must
confess
i
discovered
no
particular
malice
in
the
fellow
s
way
of
talking
the
article
shall
make
a
sensation
i
ll
spend
a
whole
month
on
it
and
make
it
a
perfect
piece
of
now
that
s
the
kind
of
thing
that
inspires
me
with
awe
and
envy
said
reardon
i
could
no
more
write
such
a
paper
than
an
article
on
tis
my
vocation
hal
you
might
think
i
hadn
t
experience
enough
to
begin
with
but
my
intuition
is
so
strong
that
i
can
make
a
little
experience
go
an
immense
way
most
people
would
imagine
i
had
been
wasting
my
time
these
last
few
years
just
sauntering
about
reading
nothing
but
periodicals
making
acquaintance
with
loafers
of
every
description
the
truth
is
i
have
been
collecting
ideas
and
ideas
that
are
convertible
into
coin
of
the
realm
my
boy
i
have
the
special
faculty
of
an
extempore
writer
never
in
my
life
shall
i
do
anything
of
solid
literary
value
i
shall
always
despise
the
people
i
write
for
but
my
path
will
be
that
of
success
i
have
always
said
it
and
now
i
m
sure
of
does
fadge
retire
from
the
study
then
inquired
reardon
when
he
had
received
this
tirade
with
a
friendly
laugh
yes
he
does
was
going
to
it
seems
in
any
case
of
course
i
heard
nothing
about
the
two
reviews
and
i
was
almost
afraid
to
smile
whilst
fadge
was
talking
with
me
lest
i
should
betray
my
thought
did
you
know
anything
about
the
fellow
before
not
didn
t
know
who
edited
the
nor
i
either
remarkable
what
a
number
of
illustrious
obscure
are
going
about
but
i
have
still
something
else
to
tell
you
i
m
going
to
set
my
sisters
afloat
in
how
well
i
don
t
see
why
they
shouldn
t
try
their
hands
at
a
little
writing
instead
of
giving
lessons
which
doesn
t
suit
them
a
bit
last
night
when
i
got
back
from
wimbledon
i
went
to
look
up
davies
perhaps
you
don
t
remember
my
mentioning
him
a
fellow
who
was
at
jolly
and
monk
s
the
publishers
up
to
a
year
ago
he
edits
a
trade
journal
now
and
i
see
very
little
of
him
however
i
found
him
at
home
and
had
a
long
practical
talk
with
him
i
wanted
to
find
out
the
state
of
the
market
as
to
such
wares
as
jolly
and
monk
dispose
of
he
gave
me
some
very
useful
hints
and
the
result
was
that
i
went
off
this
morning
and
saw
monk
himself
no
jolly
exists
at
present
mr
monk
i
began
in
my
blandest
tone
you
know
it
i
am
requested
to
call
upon
you
by
a
lady
who
thinks
of
preparing
a
little
volume
to
be
called
a
child
s
history
of
the
english
her
idea
is
that
and
so
on
well
i
got
on
admirably
with
monk
especially
when
he
learnt
that
i
was
to
be
connected
with
culpepper
s
new
venture
he
smiled
upon
the
project
and
said
he
should
be
very
glad
to
see
a
specimen
chapter
if
that
pleased
him
we
could
then
discuss
but
has
one
of
your
sisters
really
begun
such
a
book
inquired
amy
neither
of
them
knows
anything
of
the
matter
but
they
are
certainly
capable
of
doing
the
kind
of
thing
i
have
in
mind
which
will
consist
largely
of
anecdotes
of
prominent
statesmen
i
myself
shall
write
the
specimen
chapter
and
send
it
to
the
girls
to
show
them
what
i
propose
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
they
make
some
fifty
pounds
out
of
it
the
few
books
that
will
be
necessary
they
can
either
get
at
a
wattleborough
library
or
i
can
send
your
energy
is
remarkable
all
of
a
sudden
said
reardon
yes
the
hour
has
come
i
find
there
is
a
tide
to
quote
something
that
has
the
charm
of
the
supper
which
consisted
of
bread
and
butter
cheese
sardines
cocoa
was
now
over
and
jasper
still
enlarging
on
his
recent
experiences
and
future
prospects
led
the
way
back
to
the
not
very
long
after
this
amy
left
the
two
friends
to
their
pipes
she
was
anxious
that
her
husband
should
discuss
his
affairs
privately
with
milvain
and
give
ear
to
the
practical
advice
which
she
knew
would
be
tendered
him
i
hear
that
you
are
still
stuck
fast
began
jasper
when
they
had
smoked
awhile
in
silence
getting
rather
serious
i
should
fear
isn
t
it
yes
repeated
reardon
in
a
low
voice
come
come
old
man
you
can
t
go
on
in
this
way
would
it
or
wouldn
t
it
be
any
use
if
you
took
a
seaside
holiday
not
the
least
i
am
incapable
of
holiday
if
the
opportunity
were
offered
do
something
i
must
or
i
shall
fret
myself
into
very
well
what
is
it
to
be
i
shall
try
to
manufacture
two
volumes
they
needn
t
run
to
more
than
about
two
hundred
and
seventy
pages
and
those
well
spaced
this
is
refreshing
this
is
practical
but
look
now
let
it
be
something
rather
sensational
couldn
t
we
invent
a
good
title
something
to
catch
eye
and
ear
the
title
would
suggest
the
story
you
reardon
laughed
contemptuously
but
the
scorn
was
directed
rather
against
himself
than
milvain
let
s
try
he
muttered
both
appeared
to
exercise
their
minds
on
the
problem
for
a
few
minutes
then
jasper
slapped
his
knee
how
would
this
do
the
weird
sisters
devilish
good
eh
suggests
all
sorts
of
things
both
to
the
vulgar
and
the
educated
nothing
brutally
about
it
you
but
what
does
it
suggest
to
you
oh
mysterious
girls
or
women
think
it
there
was
another
long
silence
reardon
s
face
was
that
of
a
man
in
blank
misery
i
have
been
trying
he
said
at
length
after
an
attempt
to
speak
which
was
checked
by
a
huskiness
in
his
throat
to
explain
to
myself
how
this
state
of
things
has
come
about
i
almost
think
i
can
do
how
that
abroad
and
the
extraordinary
shock
of
happiness
which
followed
at
once
upon
it
have
disturbed
the
balance
of
my
nature
it
was
adjusted
to
circumstances
of
hardship
privation
struggle
a
temperament
like
mine
can
t
pass
through
such
a
violent
change
of
conditions
without
being
greatly
affected
i
have
never
since
been
the
man
i
was
before
i
left
england
the
stage
i
had
then
reached
was
the
result
of
a
slow
and
elaborate
building
up
i
could
look
back
and
see
the
processes
by
which
i
had
grown
from
the
boy
who
was
a
mere
bookworm
to
the
man
who
had
all
but
succeeded
as
a
novelist
it
was
a
perfectly
natural
sober
development
but
in
the
last
two
years
and
a
half
i
can
distinguish
no
order
in
living
through
it
i
have
imagined
from
time
to
time
that
my
powers
were
coming
to
their
ripest
but
that
was
mere
delusion
intellectually
i
have
fallen
back
the
probability
is
that
this
wouldn
t
matter
if
only
i
could
live
on
in
peace
of
mind
i
should
recover
my
equilibrium
and
perhaps
once
more
understand
myself
but
the
due
course
of
things
is
troubled
by
my
he
spoke
in
a
slow
meditative
way
in
a
monotonous
voice
and
without
raising
his
eyes
from
the
ground
i
can
understand
put
in
jasper
that
there
may
be
philosophical
truth
in
all
this
all
the
same
it
s
a
great
pity
that
you
should
occupy
your
mind
with
such
a
pity
no
i
must
remain
a
reasoning
creature
disaster
may
end
by
driving
me
out
of
my
wits
but
till
then
i
won
t
abandon
my
heritage
of
let
us
have
it
out
then
you
think
it
was
a
mistake
to
spend
those
months
abroad
a
mistake
from
the
practical
point
of
view
that
vast
broadening
of
my
horizon
lost
me
the
command
of
my
literary
resources
i
lived
in
italy
and
greece
as
a
student
concerned
especially
with
the
old
civilisations
i
read
little
but
greek
and
latin
that
brought
me
out
of
the
track
i
had
laboriously
made
for
myself
i
often
thought
with
disgust
of
the
kind
of
work
i
had
been
doing
my
novels
seemed
vapid
stuff
so
wretchedly
and
shallowly
modern
if
i
had
had
the
means
i
should
have
devoted
myself
to
the
life
of
a
scholar
that
i
quite
believe
is
my
natural
life
it
s
only
the
influence
of
recent
circumstances
that
has
made
me
a
writer
of
novels
a
man
who
can
t
journalise
yet
must
earn
his
bread
by
literature
nowadays
inevitably
turns
to
fiction
as
the
elizabethan
men
turned
to
the
drama
well
but
i
should
have
got
back
i
think
into
the
old
line
of
work
it
was
my
marriage
that
completed
what
the
time
abroad
had
he
looked
up
suddenly
and
added
i
am
speaking
as
if
to
myself
you
of
course
don
t
misunderstand
me
and
think
i
am
accusing
my
no
i
don
t
take
you
to
mean
that
by
any
no
no
of
course
not
all
that
s
wrong
is
my
accursed
want
of
money
but
that
threatens
to
be
such
a
fearful
wrong
that
i
begin
to
wish
i
had
died
before
my
then
amy
would
have
been
saved
the
philistines
are
right
a
man
has
no
business
to
marry
unless
he
has
a
secured
income
equal
to
all
natural
demands
i
behaved
with
the
grossest
selfishness
i
might
have
known
that
such
happiness
was
never
meant
for
do
you
mean
by
all
this
that
you
seriously
doubt
whether
you
will
ever
be
able
to
write
again
in
awful
seriousness
i
doubt
it
replied
reardon
with
haggard
face
it
strikes
me
as
extraordinary
in
your
position
i
should
work
as
i
never
had
done
because
you
are
the
kind
of
man
who
is
roused
by
necessity
i
am
overcome
by
it
my
nature
is
feeble
and
luxurious
i
never
in
my
life
encountered
and
overcame
a
practical
yes
when
you
got
the
work
at
the
all
i
did
was
to
write
a
letter
and
chance
made
it
my
view
of
the
case
reardon
is
that
you
are
simply
certainly
i
am
but
the
ailment
is
desperately
complicated
tell
me
do
you
think
i
might
possibly
get
any
kind
of
stated
work
to
do
should
i
be
fit
for
any
place
in
a
newspaper
office
for
instance
i
fear
not
you
are
the
last
man
to
have
anything
to
do
with
if
i
appealed
to
my
publishers
could
they
help
me
i
don
t
see
how
they
would
simply
say
write
a
book
and
we
ll
buy
yes
there
s
no
help
but
if
only
you
were
able
to
write
short
stories
fadge
might
be
but
what
s
the
use
i
suppose
i
might
get
ten
guineas
at
most
for
such
a
story
i
need
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
at
least
even
if
i
could
finish
a
book
i
doubt
if
they
would
give
me
a
hundred
again
after
the
failure
of
the
optimist
no
they
wouldn
but
to
sit
and
look
forward
in
this
way
is
absolutely
fatal
my
dear
fellow
get
to
work
at
your
story
call
it
the
weird
sisters
or
anything
better
that
you
can
devise
but
get
it
done
so
many
pages
a
day
if
i
go
ahead
as
i
begin
to
think
i
shall
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
assure
you
good
notices
in
a
lot
of
papers
your
misfortune
has
been
that
you
had
no
influential
friends
how
has
the
study
been
in
the
habit
of
treating
you
i
ll
make
an
opportunity
of
talking
about
your
books
to
fadge
i
think
fadge
and
i
shall
get
on
pretty
well
together
alfred
yule
hates
the
man
fiercely
for
some
reason
or
other
by
the
way
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
i
broke
short
off
with
the
yules
on
oh
i
had
begun
to
think
far
too
much
about
the
girl
wouldn
t
do
you
know
i
must
marry
someone
with
money
and
a
good
deal
of
it
that
s
a
settled
point
with
then
you
are
not
at
all
likely
to
meet
them
in
london
not
at
all
and
if
i
get
allied
with
fadge
no
doubt
yule
will
involve
me
in
his
savage
feeling
you
see
how
wisely
i
acted
i
have
a
scent
for
the
prudent
they
talked
for
a
long
time
but
again
chiefly
of
milvain
s
affairs
reardon
indeed
cared
little
to
say
anything
more
about
his
own
talk
was
mere
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
for
the
spring
of
his
volition
seemed
to
be
broken
and
whatever
resolve
he
might
utter
he
knew
that
everything
depended
on
influences
he
could
not
even
foresee
chapter
vii
marian
s
home
three
weeks
after
her
return
from
the
country
which
took
place
a
week
later
than
that
of
jasper
milvain
marian
yule
was
working
one
afternoon
at
her
usual
place
in
the
museum
it
was
three
o
clock
and
with
the
interval
of
half
an
hour
at
midday
when
she
went
away
for
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
sandwich
she
had
been
closely
occupied
since
nine
her
task
at
present
was
to
collect
materials
for
a
paper
on
french
authoresses
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
kind
of
thing
which
her
father
supplied
on
stipulated
terms
for
anonymous
publication
marian
was
by
this
time
almost
able
to
complete
such
a
piece
of
manufacture
herself
and
her
father
s
share
in
it
was
limited
to
a
few
hints
and
corrections
the
greater
part
of
the
work
by
which
yule
earned
his
moderate
income
was
anonymous
volumes
and
articles
which
bore
his
signature
dealt
with
much
the
same
subjects
as
his
unsigned
matter
but
the
writing
was
laboured
with
a
conscientiousness
unusual
in
men
of
his
position
the
result
unhappily
was
not
correspondent
with
the
efforts
alfred
yule
had
made
a
recognisable
name
among
the
critical
writers
of
the
day
seeing
him
in
the
of
a
periodical
most
people
knew
what
to
expect
but
not
a
few
forbore
the
cutting
open
of
the
pages
he
occupied
he
was
learned
copious
occasionally
mordant
in
style
but
grace
had
been
denied
to
him
he
had
of
late
begun
to
perceive
the
fact
that
those
passages
of
marian
s
writing
which
were
printed
just
as
they
came
from
her
pen
had
merit
of
a
kind
quite
distinct
from
anything
of
which
he
himself
was
capable
and
it
began
to
be
a
question
with
him
whether
it
would
not
be
advantageous
to
let
the
girl
sign
these
compositions
a
matter
of
business
to
be
sure
at
all
events
in
the
first
instance
for
a
long
time
marian
had
scarcely
looked
up
from
the
desk
but
at
this
moment
she
found
it
necessary
to
refer
to
the
invaluable
larousse
as
so
often
happened
the
particular
volume
of
which
she
had
need
was
not
upon
the
shelf
she
turned
away
and
looked
about
her
with
a
gaze
of
weary
disappointment
at
a
little
distance
were
standing
two
young
men
engaged
as
their
faces
showed
in
facetious
colloquy
as
soon
as
she
observed
them
marian
s
eyes
fell
but
the
next
moment
she
looked
again
in
that
direction
her
face
had
wholly
changed
she
wore
a
look
of
timid
expectancy
the
men
were
moving
towards
her
still
talking
and
laughing
she
turned
to
the
shelves
and
affected
to
search
for
a
book
the
voices
drew
near
and
one
of
them
was
well
known
to
her
now
she
could
hear
every
word
now
the
speakers
were
gone
by
was
it
possible
that
mr
milvain
had
not
recognised
her
she
followed
him
with
her
eyes
and
saw
him
take
a
seat
not
far
off
he
must
have
passed
without
even
being
aware
of
her
she
went
back
to
her
place
and
for
some
minutes
sat
trifling
with
a
pen
when
she
made
a
show
of
resuming
work
it
was
evident
that
she
could
no
longer
apply
herself
as
before
every
now
and
then
she
glanced
at
people
who
were
passing
there
were
intervals
when
she
wholly
lost
herself
in
reverie
she
was
tired
and
had
even
a
slight
headache
when
the
hand
of
the
clock
pointed
to
three
she
closed
the
volume
from
which
she
had
been
copying
extracts
and
began
to
collect
her
papers
a
voice
spoke
close
behind
her
where
s
your
father
miss
yule
the
speaker
was
a
man
of
sixty
short
stout
tonsured
by
the
hand
of
time
he
had
a
broad
flabby
face
the
colour
of
an
ancient
turnip
save
where
one
of
the
cheeks
was
marked
with
a
mulberry
stain
his
eyes
in
a
yellow
setting
glared
with
inquisitiveness
and
his
mouth
was
that
of
the
confirmed
gossip
for
eyebrows
he
had
two
little
patches
of
reddish
stubble
for
moustache
what
looked
like
a
bit
of
discoloured
tow
and
scraps
of
similar
material
hanging
beneath
his
creasy
chin
represented
a
beard
his
garb
must
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
museum
service
it
consisted
of
a
jacket
something
between
brown
and
blue
hanging
in
capacious
shapelessness
a
waistcoat
half
open
for
lack
of
buttons
and
with
one
of
the
pockets
coming
unsewn
a
pair
of
trousers
which
had
all
run
to
knee
necktie
he
had
none
and
his
linen
made
distinct
appeal
to
the
laundress
marian
shook
hands
with
him
he
went
away
at
two
was
her
reply
to
his
question
how
annoying
i
wanted
particularly
to
see
him
i
have
been
running
about
all
day
and
couldn
t
get
here
before
something
important
most
important
at
all
events
i
can
tell
you
but
i
entreat
that
you
won
t
breathe
a
word
save
to
your
mr
quarmby
that
was
his
name
had
taken
a
vacant
chair
and
drawn
it
close
to
marian
s
he
was
in
a
state
of
joyous
excitement
and
talked
in
thick
rather
pompous
tones
with
a
pant
at
the
end
of
a
sentence
to
emphasise
the
extremely
confidential
nature
of
his
remarks
he
brought
his
head
almost
in
contact
with
the
girl
s
and
one
of
her
thin
delicate
hands
was
covered
with
his
red
podgy
fingers
i
ve
had
a
talk
with
nathaniel
walker
he
continued
a
long
talk
a
talk
of
vast
importance
you
know
walker
no
no
how
should
you
he
s
a
man
of
business
close
friend
of
rackett
s
rackett
you
know
the
owner
of
the
upon
this
he
made
a
grave
pause
and
glared
more
excitedly
than
ever
i
have
heard
of
mr
rackett
said
marian
of
course
of
course
and
you
must
also
have
heard
that
fadge
leaves
the
study
at
the
end
of
this
year
eh
father
told
me
it
was
rackett
and
he
have
done
nothing
but
quarrel
for
months
the
paper
is
falling
off
seriously
well
now
when
i
came
across
nat
walker
this
afternoon
the
first
thing
he
said
to
me
was
you
know
alfred
yule
pretty
well
i
think
pretty
well
i
answered
why
i
ll
tell
you
he
said
but
it
s
between
you
and
me
you
understand
rackett
is
thinking
about
him
in
connection
with
the
i
m
delighted
to
hear
to
tell
you
the
truth
went
on
nat
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
yule
gets
the
editorship
but
you
understand
that
it
would
be
altogether
premature
to
talk
about
now
what
do
you
think
of
this
eh
it
s
very
good
news
answered
marian
i
should
think
so
ho
ho
mr
quarmby
laughed
in
a
peculiar
way
which
was
the
result
of
long
years
of
in
the
but
not
a
breath
to
anyone
but
your
father
he
ll
be
here
break
it
gently
to
him
you
know
he
s
an
excitable
man
can
t
take
things
quietly
like
i
do
ho
ho
his
suppressed
laugh
ended
in
a
fit
of
coughing
the
cough
when
he
had
recovered
from
it
he
pressed
marian
s
hand
with
paternal
fervour
and
waddled
off
to
chatter
with
someone
else
marian
replaced
several
books
on
the
returned
others
to
the
central
desk
and
was
just
leaving
the
room
when
again
a
voice
made
demand
upon
her
attention
miss
yule
one
moment
if
you
please
it
was
a
tall
meagre
man
dressed
with
the
painful
neatness
of
poverty
the
edges
of
his
were
carefully
darned
his
black
necktie
and
a
which
covered
his
baldness
were
evidently
of
home
manufacture
he
smiled
softly
and
timidly
with
blue
rheumy
eyes
two
or
three
recent
cuts
on
his
chin
and
neck
were
the
result
of
conscientious
shaving
with
an
unsteady
hand
i
have
been
looking
for
your
father
he
said
as
marian
turned
isn
t
he
here
he
has
gone
mr
ah
then
would
you
do
me
the
kindness
to
take
a
book
for
him
in
fact
it
s
my
little
essay
on
the
historical
drama
just
he
spoke
with
nervous
hesitation
and
in
a
tone
which
seemed
to
make
apology
for
his
existence
oh
father
will
be
very
glad
to
have
if
you
will
kindly
wait
one
minute
miss
yule
it
s
at
my
place
over
he
went
off
with
long
strides
and
speedily
came
back
panting
in
his
hand
a
thin
new
volume
my
kind
regards
to
him
miss
yule
you
are
quite
well
i
hope
i
won
t
detain
and
he
backed
into
a
man
who
was
coming
inobservantly
this
way
marian
went
to
the
ladies
put
on
her
hat
and
jacket
and
left
the
museum
some
one
passed
out
through
the
a
moment
before
her
and
as
soon
as
she
had
issued
beneath
the
portico
she
saw
that
it
was
jasper
milvain
she
must
have
followed
him
through
the
hall
but
her
eyes
had
been
cast
down
the
young
man
was
now
alone
as
he
descended
the
steps
he
looked
to
left
and
right
but
not
behind
him
marian
followed
at
a
distance
of
two
or
three
yards
nearing
the
gateway
she
quickened
her
pace
a
little
so
as
to
pass
out
into
the
street
almost
at
the
same
moment
as
milvain
but
he
did
not
turn
his
head
he
took
to
the
right
marian
had
fallen
back
again
but
she
still
followed
at
a
very
little
distance
his
walk
was
slow
and
she
might
easily
have
passed
him
in
quite
a
natural
way
in
that
case
he
could
not
help
seeing
her
but
there
was
an
uneasy
suspicion
in
her
mind
that
he
really
must
have
noticed
her
in
the
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
seen
him
since
their
parting
at
finden
had
he
any
reason
for
avoiding
her
did
he
take
it
ill
that
her
father
had
shown
no
desire
to
keep
up
his
acquaintance
she
allowed
the
interval
between
them
to
become
greater
in
a
minute
or
two
milvain
turned
up
charlotte
street
and
so
she
lost
sight
of
him
in
tottenham
court
road
she
waited
for
an
omnibus
that
would
take
her
to
the
remoter
part
of
camden
town
obtaining
a
corner
seat
she
drew
as
far
back
as
possible
and
paid
no
attention
to
her
at
a
point
in
camden
road
she
at
length
alighted
and
after
ten
minutes
walk
reached
her
destination
in
a
quiet
called
st
paul
s
crescent
consisting
of
small
decent
houses
that
at
which
she
paused
had
an
exterior
promising
comfort
within
the
windows
were
clean
and
neatly
curtained
and
the
polishable
appurtenances
of
the
door
gleamed
to
perfection
she
admitted
herself
with
a
and
went
straight
upstairs
without
encountering
anyone
descending
again
in
a
few
moments
she
entered
the
front
room
on
the
this
served
both
as
parlour
and
it
was
comfortably
furnished
without
much
attempt
at
adornment
on
the
walls
were
a
few
autotypes
and
old
engravings
a
recess
between
fireplace
and
window
was
fitted
with
shelves
which
supported
hundreds
of
volumes
the
overflow
of
yule
s
library
the
table
was
laid
for
a
meal
it
best
suited
the
convenience
of
the
family
to
dine
at
five
o
clock
a
long
evening
so
necessary
to
most
literary
people
was
thus
assured
marian
as
always
when
she
had
spent
a
day
at
the
museum
was
faint
with
weariness
and
hunger
she
cut
a
small
piece
of
bread
from
a
loaf
on
the
table
and
sat
down
in
an
easy
chair
presently
appeared
a
short
slight
woman
of
middle
age
plainly
dressed
in
serviceable
grey
her
face
could
never
have
been
very
comely
and
it
expressed
but
moderate
intelligence
its
lines
however
were
those
of
gentleness
and
good
feeling
she
had
the
look
of
one
who
is
making
a
painful
effort
to
understand
something
this
was
fixed
upon
her
features
and
probably
resulted
from
the
peculiar
conditions
of
her
life
rather
early
aren
t
you
marian
she
said
as
she
closed
the
door
and
came
forward
to
take
a
seat
yes
i
have
a
little
oh
dear
is
that
beginning
again
mrs
yule
s
speech
was
seldom
ungrammatical
and
her
intonation
was
not
flagrantly
vulgar
but
the
accent
of
the
london
poor
which
brands
as
with
hereditary
baseness
still
clung
to
her
words
rendering
futile
such
propriety
of
phrase
as
she
owed
to
years
of
association
with
educated
people
in
the
same
degree
did
her
bearing
fall
short
of
that
which
distinguishes
a
lady
the
london
is
rarely
capable
of
raising
herself
or
being
raised
to
a
place
in
life
above
that
to
which
she
was
born
she
can
not
learn
how
to
stand
and
sit
and
move
like
a
woman
bred
to
refinement
any
more
than
she
can
fashion
her
tongue
to
graceful
speech
mrs
yule
s
behaviour
to
marian
was
marked
with
a
singular
diffidence
she
looked
and
spoke
affectionately
but
not
with
a
mother
s
freedom
one
might
have
taken
her
for
a
trusted
servant
waiting
upon
her
mistress
whenever
opportunity
offered
she
watched
the
girl
in
a
curiously
furtive
way
that
puzzled
look
on
her
face
becoming
very
noticeable
her
consciousness
was
never
able
to
accept
as
a
familiar
and
unimportant
fact
the
vast
difference
between
herself
and
her
daughter
marian
s
superiority
in
native
powers
in
delicacy
of
feeling
in
the
results
of
education
could
never
be
lost
sight
of
under
ordinary
circumstances
she
addressed
the
girl
as
if
tentatively
however
sure
of
anything
from
her
own
point
of
view
she
knew
that
marian
as
often
as
not
had
quite
a
different
criterion
she
understood
that
the
girl
frequently
expressed
an
opinion
by
mere
reticence
and
hence
the
carefulness
with
which
when
conversing
she
tried
to
discover
the
real
effect
of
her
words
in
marian
s
features
hungry
too
she
said
seeing
the
crust
marian
was
nibbling
you
really
must
have
more
lunch
dear
it
isn
t
right
to
go
so
long
you
ll
make
yourself
have
you
been
out
marian
asked
yes
i
went
to
mrs
yule
sighed
and
looked
very
unhappy
by
going
to
holloway
was
always
meant
a
visit
to
her
own
relatives
a
married
sister
with
three
children
and
a
brother
who
inhabited
the
same
house
to
her
husband
she
scarcely
ever
ventured
to
speak
of
these
persons
yule
had
no
intercourse
with
them
but
marian
was
always
willing
to
listen
sympathetically
and
her
mother
often
exhibited
a
touching
gratitude
for
this
condescension
as
she
deemed
it
are
things
no
better
the
girl
inquired
worse
as
far
as
i
can
see
john
has
begun
his
drinking
again
and
him
and
tom
quarrel
every
night
there
s
no
peace
in
the
if
ever
mrs
yule
lapsed
into
gross
errors
of
pronunciation
or
phrase
it
was
when
she
spoke
of
her
kinsfolk
the
subject
seemed
to
throw
her
back
into
a
former
condition
he
ought
to
go
and
live
by
himself
said
marian
referring
to
her
mother
s
brother
the
thirsty
john
so
he
ought
to
be
sure
i
m
always
telling
them
so
but
there
you
don
t
seem
to
be
able
to
persuade
them
they
re
that
silly
and
obstinate
and
susan
she
only
gets
angry
with
me
and
tells
me
not
to
talk
in
a
way
i
m
sure
i
never
say
a
word
that
could
offend
her
i
m
too
careful
for
that
and
there
s
annie
no
doing
anything
with
her
she
s
about
the
streets
at
all
hours
and
what
ll
be
the
end
of
it
no
one
can
say
they
re
getting
that
ragged
all
of
them
it
isn
t
susan
s
fault
indeed
it
isn
t
she
does
all
that
woman
can
but
tom
hasn
t
brought
home
ten
shillings
the
last
month
and
it
seems
to
me
as
if
he
was
getting
careless
i
gave
her
it
was
all
i
could
do
and
the
worst
of
it
is
they
think
i
could
do
so
much
more
if
i
liked
they
re
always
hinting
that
we
are
rich
people
and
it
s
no
good
my
trying
to
persuade
them
they
think
i
m
telling
falsehoods
and
it
s
very
hard
to
be
looked
at
in
that
way
it
is
indeed
you
can
t
help
it
mother
i
suppose
their
suffering
makes
them
unkind
and
that
s
just
what
it
does
my
dear
you
never
said
anything
truer
poverty
will
make
the
best
people
bad
if
it
gets
hard
enough
why
there
s
so
much
of
it
in
the
world
i
m
sure
i
can
t
i
suppose
father
will
be
back
soon
he
said
mr
quarmby
has
been
telling
me
something
which
is
wonderfully
good
news
if
it
s
really
true
but
i
can
t
help
feeling
doubtful
he
says
that
father
may
perhaps
be
made
editor
of
the
study
at
the
end
of
this
mrs
yule
of
course
understood
in
outline
these
affairs
of
the
literary
world
she
thought
of
them
only
from
the
pecuniary
point
of
view
but
that
made
no
essential
distinction
between
her
and
the
mass
of
literary
people
my
word
she
exclaimed
what
a
thing
that
would
be
for
us
marian
had
begun
to
explain
her
reluctance
to
base
any
hopes
on
mr
quarmby
s
prediction
when
the
sound
of
a
postman
s
knock
at
the
caused
her
mother
to
disappear
for
a
moment
it
s
for
you
said
mrs
yule
returning
from
the
marian
took
the
letter
and
examined
its
address
with
interest
it
must
be
one
of
the
miss
milvains
yes
dora
after
jasper
s
departure
from
finden
his
sisters
had
seen
marian
several
times
and
the
mutual
liking
between
her
and
them
had
been
confirmed
by
opportunity
of
conversation
the
promise
of
correspondence
had
hitherto
waited
for
fulfilment
it
seemed
natural
to
marian
that
the
younger
of
the
two
girls
should
write
maud
was
attractive
and
agreeable
and
probably
clever
but
dora
had
more
spontaneity
in
friendship
it
will
amuse
you
to
hear
wrote
dora
that
the
literary
project
our
brother
mentioned
in
a
letter
whilst
you
were
still
here
is
really
to
come
to
something
he
has
sent
us
a
specimen
chapter
written
by
himself
of
the
child
s
history
of
parliament
and
maud
thinks
she
could
carry
it
on
in
that
style
if
there
s
no
hurry
she
and
i
have
both
set
to
work
on
english
histories
and
we
shall
be
authorities
before
long
jolly
and
monk
offer
thirty
pounds
for
the
little
book
if
it
suits
them
when
finished
with
certain
possible
profits
in
the
future
trust
jasper
for
making
a
bargain
so
perhaps
our
literary
career
will
be
something
more
than
a
joke
after
all
i
hope
it
may
anything
rather
than
a
life
of
teaching
we
shall
be
so
glad
to
hear
from
you
if
you
still
care
to
trouble
about
country
and
so
on
marian
read
with
a
pleased
smile
then
acquainted
her
mother
with
the
contents
i
am
very
glad
said
mrs
yule
it
s
so
seldom
you
get
a
marian
seemed
desirous
of
saying
something
more
and
her
mother
had
a
thoughtful
look
suggestive
of
sympathetic
curiosity
is
their
brother
likely
to
call
here
mrs
yule
asked
with
misgiving
no
one
has
invited
him
to
was
the
girl
s
quiet
reply
he
wouldn
t
come
without
that
it
s
not
likely
that
he
even
knows
the
your
father
won
t
be
seeing
him
i
suppose
by
chance
perhaps
i
don
t
it
was
very
rare
indeed
for
these
two
to
touch
upon
any
subject
save
those
of
everyday
interest
in
spite
of
the
affection
between
them
their
exchange
of
confidence
did
not
go
very
far
mrs
yule
who
had
never
exercised
maternal
authority
since
marian
s
earliest
childhood
claimed
no
maternal
privileges
and
marian
s
natural
reserve
had
been
strengthened
by
her
mother
s
respectful
aloofness
the
english
fault
of
domestic
reticence
could
scarcely
go
further
than
it
did
in
their
case
its
exaggeration
is
of
course
one
of
the
characteristics
of
those
unhappy
families
severed
by
differences
of
education
between
the
old
and
young
i
think
said
marian
in
a
forced
tone
that
father
hasn
t
much
liking
for
mr
she
wished
to
know
if
her
mother
had
heard
any
private
remarks
on
this
subject
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
ask
directly
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
replied
mrs
yule
smoothing
her
dress
he
hasn
t
said
anything
to
me
an
awkward
silence
the
mother
had
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
mantelpiece
and
was
thinking
hard
otherwise
said
marian
he
would
have
said
something
i
should
think
about
meeting
in
but
is
there
anything
in
this
gentleman
that
he
wouldn
t
like
i
don
t
know
of
impossible
to
pursue
the
dialogue
marian
moved
uneasily
then
rose
said
something
about
putting
the
letter
away
and
left
the
room
shortly
after
alfred
yule
entered
the
house
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
him
to
come
home
in
a
mood
of
silent
moroseness
and
this
evening
the
first
glimpse
of
his
face
was
sufficient
warning
he
entered
the
and
stood
on
the
hearthrug
reading
an
evening
paper
his
wife
made
a
pretence
of
straightening
things
upon
the
table
well
he
exclaimed
irritably
it
s
after
five
why
isn
t
dinner
served
it
s
just
coming
even
the
average
man
of
a
certain
age
is
an
alarming
creature
when
dinner
delays
itself
the
literary
man
in
such
a
moment
goes
beyond
all
parallel
if
there
be
added
the
fact
that
he
has
just
returned
from
a
very
unsatisfactory
interview
with
a
publisher
wife
and
daughter
may
indeed
regard
the
situation
as
appalling
marian
came
in
and
at
once
observed
her
mother
s
frightened
face
father
she
said
hoping
to
make
a
diversion
mr
hinks
has
sent
you
his
new
book
and
wishes
then
take
mr
hinks
s
new
book
back
to
him
and
tell
him
that
i
have
quite
enough
to
do
without
reading
tedious
trash
he
needn
t
expect
that
i
m
going
to
write
a
notice
of
it
the
simpleton
pesters
me
beyond
endurance
i
wish
to
know
if
you
please
he
added
with
savage
calm
when
dinner
will
be
ready
if
there
s
time
to
write
a
few
letters
just
tell
me
at
once
that
i
mayn
t
waste
half
an
marian
resented
this
unreasonable
anger
but
she
durst
not
reply
at
that
moment
the
servant
appeared
with
a
smoking
joint
and
mrs
yule
followed
carrying
dishes
of
vegetables
the
man
of
letters
seated
himself
and
carved
angrily
he
began
his
meal
by
drinking
half
a
glass
of
ale
then
he
ate
a
few
mouthfuls
in
a
quick
hungry
way
his
head
bent
closely
over
the
plate
it
happened
commonly
enough
that
dinner
passed
without
a
word
of
conversation
and
that
seemed
likely
to
be
the
case
this
evening
to
his
wife
yule
seldom
addressed
anything
but
a
curt
inquiry
or
caustic
comment
if
he
spoke
humanly
at
table
it
was
to
marian
ten
minutes
passed
then
marian
resolved
to
try
any
means
of
clearing
the
atmosphere
mr
quarmby
gave
me
a
message
for
you
she
said
a
friend
of
his
nathaniel
walker
has
told
him
that
mr
rackett
will
very
likely
offer
you
the
editorship
of
the
yule
stopped
in
the
act
of
mastication
he
fixed
his
eyes
intently
on
the
sirloin
for
half
a
minute
then
by
way
of
the
and
the
turned
them
upon
marian
s
face
walker
told
him
that
pooh
it
was
a
great
secret
i
wasn
t
to
breathe
a
word
to
any
one
but
walker
s
a
fool
and
quarmby
s
an
ass
remarked
her
father
but
there
was
a
tremulousness
in
his
bushy
eyebrows
his
forehead
half
unwreathed
itself
he
continued
to
eat
more
slowly
and
as
if
with
appreciation
of
the
viands
what
did
he
say
repeat
it
to
me
in
his
marian
did
so
as
nearly
as
possible
he
listened
with
a
scoffing
expression
but
still
his
features
relaxed
i
don
t
credit
rackett
with
enough
good
sense
for
such
a
proposal
he
said
deliberately
and
i
m
not
very
sure
that
i
should
accept
it
if
it
were
made
that
fellow
fadge
has
all
but
ruined
the
paper
it
will
amuse
me
to
see
how
long
it
takes
him
to
make
culpepper
s
new
magazine
a
distinct
a
silence
of
five
minutes
ensued
then
yule
said
of
a
sudden
where
is
hinks
s
book
marian
reached
it
from
a
side
table
under
this
roof
literature
was
regarded
almost
as
a
necessary
part
of
table
garnishing
i
thought
it
would
be
bigger
than
this
yule
muttered
as
he
opened
the
volume
in
a
way
peculiar
to
bookish
men
a
page
was
turned
down
as
if
to
draw
attention
to
some
passage
yule
put
on
his
eyeglasses
and
soon
made
a
discovery
which
had
the
effect
of
completing
the
transformation
of
his
visage
his
eyes
glinted
his
chin
worked
in
pleasurable
emotion
in
a
moment
he
handed
the
book
to
marian
indicating
the
small
type
of
a
it
embodied
an
effusive
eulogy
introduced
a
propos
of
some
literary
discussion
of
mr
alfred
yule
s
critical
acumen
scholarly
research
lucid
style
and
sundry
other
distinguished
merits
that
is
kind
of
him
said
marian
good
old
hinks
i
suppose
i
must
try
to
get
him
may
i
see
asked
mrs
yule
under
her
breath
bending
to
marian
her
daughter
passed
on
the
volume
and
mrs
yule
read
the
footnote
with
that
look
of
slow
apprehension
which
is
so
pathetic
when
it
signifies
the
heart
s
thwarted
by
the
mind
s
defect
that
ll
be
good
for
you
alfred
won
t
it
she
said
glancing
at
her
husband
certainly
he
replied
with
a
smile
of
contemptuous
irony
if
hinks
goes
on
he
ll
establish
my
and
he
took
a
draught
of
ale
like
one
who
is
reinvigorated
for
the
battle
of
life
marian
regarding
him
askance
mused
on
what
seemed
to
her
a
strange
anomaly
in
his
character
it
had
often
surprised
her
that
a
man
of
his
temperament
and
powers
should
be
so
dependent
upon
the
praise
and
blame
of
people
whom
he
justly
deemed
his
inferiors
yule
was
glancing
over
the
pages
of
the
work
a
pity
the
man
can
t
write
what
a
vocabulary
obstruent
reliable
particularization
fabulosity
different
to
averse
to
did
one
ever
come
across
such
a
mixture
of
antique
pedantry
and
modern
vulgarism
surely
he
has
his
name
from
the
german
hinken
eh
marian
with
a
laugh
he
tossed
the
book
away
again
his
mood
was
wholly
changed
he
gave
various
evidences
of
enjoying
the
meal
and
began
to
talk
freely
with
his
daughter
finished
the
authoresses
not
no
hurry
when
you
have
time
i
want
you
to
read
ditchley
s
new
book
and
jot
down
a
selection
of
his
worst
sentences
i
ll
use
them
for
an
article
on
contemporary
style
it
occurred
to
me
this
he
smiled
grimly
mrs
yule
s
face
exhibited
much
contentment
which
became
radiant
joy
when
her
husband
remarked
casually
that
the
custard
was
very
well
made
dinner
over
he
rose
without
ceremony
and
went
off
to
his
study
the
man
had
suffered
much
and
toiled
stupendously
it
was
not
inexplicable
that
dyspepsia
and
many
another
ill
that
literary
flesh
is
heir
to
racked
him
sore
go
back
to
the
days
when
he
was
an
assistant
at
a
bookseller
s
in
holborn
already
ambition
devoured
him
and
the
genuine
love
of
knowledge
goaded
his
brain
he
allowed
himself
but
three
or
four
hours
of
sleep
he
wrought
doggedly
at
languages
ancient
and
modern
he
tried
his
hand
at
metrical
translations
he
planned
tragedies
practically
he
was
living
in
a
past
age
his
literary
ideals
were
formed
on
the
study
of
boswell
the
head
assistant
in
the
shop
went
away
to
pursue
a
business
which
had
come
into
his
hands
on
the
death
of
a
relative
it
was
a
small
publishing
concern
housed
in
an
alley
off
the
strand
and
mr
polo
a
singular
name
to
become
well
known
in
the
course
of
time
had
his
ideas
about
its
possible
extension
among
other
instances
of
activity
he
started
a
penny
weekly
paper
called
all
sorts
and
in
the
pages
of
this
periodical
alfred
yule
first
appeared
as
an
author
before
long
he
became
of
all
sorts
then
actual
director
of
the
paper
he
said
to
the
bookseller
and
his
literary
career
fairly
began
mr
polo
used
to
say
that
he
never
knew
a
man
who
could
work
so
many
consecutive
hours
as
alfred
yule
a
faithful
account
of
all
that
the
young
man
learnt
and
wrote
from
to
that
is
from
his
to
his
thirtieth
year
would
have
the
look
of
burlesque
exaggeration
he
had
set
it
before
him
to
become
a
celebrated
man
and
he
was
not
unaware
that
the
attainment
of
that
end
would
cost
him
quite
exceptional
labour
seeing
that
nature
had
not
favoured
him
with
brilliant
parts
no
matter
his
name
should
be
spoken
among
men
unless
he
killed
himself
in
the
struggle
for
success
in
the
meantime
he
married
living
in
a
garret
and
supplying
himself
with
the
materials
of
his
scanty
meals
he
was
in
the
habit
of
making
purchases
at
a
little
chandler
s
shop
where
he
was
waited
upon
by
a
young
girl
of
no
beauty
but
as
it
seemed
to
him
of
amiable
disposition
one
holiday
he
met
this
girl
as
she
was
walking
with
a
younger
sister
in
the
streets
he
made
her
nearer
acquaintance
and
before
long
she
consented
to
be
his
wife
and
share
his
garret
his
brothers
john
and
edmund
cried
out
that
he
had
made
an
unpardonable
fool
of
himself
in
marrying
so
much
beneath
him
that
he
might
well
have
waited
until
his
income
improved
this
was
all
very
well
but
they
might
just
as
reasonably
have
bidden
him
reject
plain
food
because
a
few
years
hence
he
would
be
able
to
purchase
luxuries
he
could
not
do
without
nourishment
of
some
sort
and
the
time
had
come
when
he
could
not
do
without
a
wife
many
a
man
with
brains
but
no
money
has
been
compelled
to
the
same
step
educated
girls
have
a
pronounced
distaste
for
london
garrets
not
one
in
fifty
thousand
would
share
poverty
with
the
brightest
genius
ever
born
seeing
that
marriage
is
so
often
indispensable
to
that
very
success
which
would
enable
a
man
of
parts
to
mate
equally
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
look
below
one
s
own
level
and
be
grateful
to
the
untaught
woman
who
has
pity
on
one
s
loneliness
unfortunately
alfred
yule
was
not
so
grateful
as
he
might
have
been
his
marriage
proved
far
from
unsuccessful
he
might
have
found
himself
united
to
a
vulgar
shrew
whereas
the
girl
had
the
great
virtues
of
humility
and
kindliness
she
endeavoured
to
learn
of
him
but
her
dulness
and
his
impatience
made
this
attempt
a
failure
her
human
qualities
had
to
suffice
and
they
did
until
yule
began
to
lift
his
head
above
the
literary
mob
previously
he
often
lost
his
temper
with
her
but
never
expressed
or
felt
repentance
of
his
marriage
now
he
began
to
see
only
the
disadvantages
of
his
position
and
forgetting
the
facts
of
the
case
to
imagine
that
he
might
well
have
waited
for
a
wife
who
could
share
his
intellectual
existence
mrs
yule
had
to
pass
through
a
few
years
of
much
bitterness
already
a
martyr
to
dyspepsia
and
often
suffering
from
bilious
headaches
of
extreme
violence
her
husband
now
and
then
lost
all
control
of
his
temper
all
sense
of
kind
feeling
even
of
decency
and
reproached
the
poor
woman
with
her
ignorance
her
stupidity
her
low
origin
naturally
enough
she
defended
herself
with
such
weapons
as
a
sense
of
cruel
injustice
supplied
more
than
once
the
two
all
but
parted
it
did
not
come
to
an
actual
rupture
chiefly
because
yule
could
not
do
without
his
wife
her
tendance
had
become
indispensable
and
then
there
was
the
child
to
consider
from
the
first
it
was
yule
s
dread
lest
marian
should
be
infected
with
her
mother
s
faults
of
speech
and
behaviour
he
would
scarcely
permit
his
wife
to
talk
to
the
child
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
marian
was
sent
to
a
and
in
her
tenth
year
she
went
as
weekly
boarder
to
an
establishment
at
fulham
any
sacrifice
of
money
to
insure
her
growing
up
with
the
tongue
and
manners
of
a
lady
it
can
scarcely
have
been
a
light
trial
to
the
mother
to
know
that
contact
with
her
was
regarded
as
her
child
s
greatest
danger
but
in
her
humility
and
her
love
for
marian
she
offered
no
resistance
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
one
day
the
little
girl
hearing
her
mother
make
some
flagrant
grammatical
error
turned
to
the
other
parent
and
asked
gravely
why
doesn
t
mother
speak
as
properly
as
we
do
well
that
is
one
of
the
results
of
such
marriages
one
of
the
myriad
miseries
that
result
from
poverty
the
end
was
gained
at
all
hazards
marian
grew
up
everything
that
her
father
desired
not
only
had
she
the
bearing
of
refinement
but
it
early
became
obvious
that
nature
had
well
endowed
her
with
brains
from
the
nursery
her
talk
was
of
books
and
at
the
age
of
twelve
she
was
already
able
to
give
her
father
some
assistance
as
an
amanuensis
at
that
time
edmund
yule
was
still
living
he
had
overcome
his
prejudices
and
there
was
intercourse
between
his
household
and
that
of
the
literary
man
intimacy
it
could
not
be
called
for
mrs
edmund
who
was
the
daughter
of
a
had
much
difficulty
in
behaving
to
mrs
alfred
with
show
of
suavity
still
the
cousins
amy
and
marian
from
time
to
time
saw
each
other
and
were
not
unsuitable
companions
it
was
the
death
of
amy
s
father
that
brought
these
relations
to
an
end
left
to
the
control
of
her
own
affairs
mrs
edmund
was
not
long
in
giving
offence
to
mrs
alfred
and
so
to
alfred
himself
the
man
of
letters
might
be
inconsiderate
enough
in
his
behaviour
to
his
wife
but
as
soon
as
anyone
else
treated
her
with
disrespect
that
was
quite
another
matter
purely
on
this
account
he
quarrelled
violently
with
his
brother
s
widow
and
from
that
day
the
two
families
kept
apart
the
chapter
of
quarrels
was
one
of
no
small
importance
in
alfred
s
life
his
difficult
temper
and
an
sense
of
neglected
merit
frequently
put
him
at
war
with
publishers
editors
and
he
had
an
unhappy
trick
of
exciting
the
hostility
of
men
who
were
most
likely
to
be
useful
to
him
with
mr
polo
for
instance
who
held
him
in
esteem
and
whose
commercial
success
made
him
a
valuable
connection
alfred
ultimately
broke
on
a
trifling
matter
of
personal
dignity
later
came
the
great
quarrel
with
clement
fadge
an
affair
of
considerable
advantage
in
the
way
of
advertisement
to
both
the
men
concerned
it
happened
in
the
year
at
that
time
yule
was
editor
of
a
weekly
paper
called
the
balance
a
literary
organ
which
aimed
high
and
failed
to
hit
the
circulation
essential
to
its
existence
fadge
a
younger
man
did
reviewing
for
the
balance
he
was
in
needy
circumstances
and
had
wrought
himself
into
yule
s
good
opinion
by
judicious
flattery
but
with
a
clear
eye
for
the
main
chance
mr
fadge
soon
perceived
that
yule
could
only
be
of
temporary
use
to
him
and
that
the
editor
of
a
weekly
which
lost
no
opportunity
of
throwing
scorn
upon
yule
and
all
his
works
would
be
a
much
more
profitable
conquest
he
succeeded
in
transferring
his
services
to
the
more
flourishing
paper
and
struck
out
a
special
line
of
work
by
the
free
exercise
of
a
malicious
flippancy
which
was
then
without
rival
in
the
periodical
press
when
he
had
thoroughly
got
his
hand
in
it
fell
to
mr
fadge
in
the
mere
way
of
business
to
review
a
volume
of
his
old
editor
s
a
rather
pretentious
and
longwinded
but
far
from
worthless
essay
on
imagination
as
a
national
the
notice
was
a
masterpiece
its
exquisite
virulence
set
the
literary
circles
chuckling
concerning
the
authorship
there
was
no
mystery
and
alfred
yule
had
the
indiscretion
to
make
a
violent
reply
a
savage
assault
upon
fadge
in
the
columns
of
the
balance
fadge
desired
nothing
better
the
uproar
which
arose
chaff
fury
grave
comments
sneering
spite
could
only
result
in
drawing
universal
attention
to
his
anonymous
cleverness
and
throwing
ridicule
upon
the
heavy
conscientious
man
well
you
probably
remember
all
about
it
it
ended
in
the
disappearance
of
yule
s
struggling
paper
and
the
establishment
on
a
firm
basis
of
fadge
s
reputation
it
would
be
difficult
to
mention
any
department
of
literary
endeavour
in
which
yule
did
not
at
one
time
or
another
try
his
fortune
turn
to
his
name
in
the
museum
catalogue
the
list
of
works
appended
to
it
will
amuse
you
in
his
thirtieth
year
he
published
a
novel
it
failed
completely
and
the
same
result
awaited
a
similar
experiment
five
years
later
he
wrote
a
drama
of
modern
life
and
for
some
years
strove
to
get
it
acted
but
in
vain
finally
it
appeared
for
the
closet
giving
clement
fadge
such
an
opportunity
as
he
seldom
enjoyed
the
one
noteworthy
thing
about
these
productions
and
about
others
of
equally
mistaken
direction
was
the
sincerity
of
their
workmanship
had
yule
been
content
to
manufacture
a
novel
or
a
play
with
due
disregard
for
literary
honour
he
might
perchance
have
made
a
mercantile
success
but
the
poor
fellow
had
not
pliancy
enough
for
this
he
took
his
efforts
au
grand
serieux
thought
he
was
producing
works
of
art
pursued
his
ambition
in
a
spirit
of
fierce
conscientiousness
in
spite
of
all
he
remained
only
a
journeyman
the
kind
of
work
he
did
best
was
poorly
paid
and
could
bring
no
fame
at
the
age
of
fifty
he
was
still
living
in
a
poor
house
in
an
obscure
quarter
he
earned
enough
for
his
actual
needs
and
was
under
no
pressing
fear
for
the
morrow
so
long
as
his
faculties
remained
unimpaired
but
there
was
no
disguising
from
himself
that
his
life
had
been
a
failure
and
the
thought
tormented
him
now
there
had
come
unexpectedly
a
gleam
of
hope
if
indeed
the
man
rackett
thought
of
offering
him
the
editorship
of
the
study
he
might
even
yet
taste
the
triumphs
for
which
he
had
so
vehemently
longed
the
study
was
a
weekly
paper
of
fair
repute
fadge
had
harmed
it
no
doubt
of
that
by
giving
it
a
tone
which
did
not
suit
the
majority
of
its
readers
serious
people
who
thought
that
the
criticism
of
contemporary
writing
offered
an
opportunity
for
something
better
than
a
display
of
malevolent
wit
but
a
return
to
the
old
earnestness
would
doubtless
set
all
right
again
and
the
joy
of
sitting
in
that
dictatorial
chair
the
delight
of
having
his
own
organ
once
more
of
making
himself
a
power
in
the
world
of
letters
of
emphasising
to
a
large
audience
his
developed
methods
of
criticism
an
embittered
man
is
a
man
beset
by
evil
temptations
the
study
contained
each
week
certain
columns
of
flying
gossip
and
when
he
thought
of
this
yule
also
thought
of
clement
fadge
and
sundry
other
of
his
worst
enemies
how
the
gossip
column
can
be
used
for
hostile
purposes
yet
without
the
least
overt
offence
he
had
learnt
only
too
well
sometimes
the
mere
omission
of
a
man
s
name
from
a
list
of
authors
can
mortify
and
injure
in
our
day
the
manipulation
of
such
paragraphs
has
become
a
fine
art
but
you
recall
numerous
illustrations
alfred
knew
well
enough
how
incessantly
the
tempter
would
be
at
his
ear
he
said
to
himself
that
in
certain
instances
yielding
would
be
no
dishonour
he
himself
had
many
a
time
been
mercilessly
treated
in
the
very
interest
of
the
public
it
was
good
that
certain
men
should
suffer
a
snubbing
and
his
fingers
itched
to
have
hold
of
the
editorial
pen
ha
ha
like
the
he
snuffed
the
battle
afar
off
no
work
this
evening
though
there
were
tasks
which
pressed
for
completion
his
study
the
only
room
on
the
ground
level
except
the
was
small
and
even
a
good
deal
of
the
floor
was
encumbered
with
books
but
he
found
space
for
walking
nervously
hither
and
thither
he
was
doing
this
when
about
nine
his
wife
appeared
at
the
door
bringing
him
a
cup
of
coffee
and
some
biscuits
his
wonted
supper
marian
generally
waited
upon
him
at
this
time
and
he
asked
why
she
had
not
come
she
has
one
of
her
headaches
again
i
m
sorry
to
say
mrs
yule
replied
i
persuaded
her
to
go
to
bed
having
placed
the
tray
upon
the
table
books
had
to
be
pushed
aside
she
did
not
seem
disposed
to
withdraw
are
you
busy
alfred
why
i
thought
i
should
like
just
to
speak
of
she
was
using
the
opportunity
of
his
good
humour
yule
spoke
to
her
with
the
usual
carelessness
but
not
forbiddingly
what
is
it
those
holloway
people
i
ll
no
no
it
s
about
marian
she
had
a
letter
from
one
of
those
young
ladies
this
what
young
ladies
asked
yule
with
impatience
of
this
circuitous
approach
the
miss
well
there
s
no
harm
that
i
know
of
they
re
decent
yes
so
you
told
me
but
she
began
to
speak
about
their
brother
and
what
about
him
do
say
what
you
want
to
say
and
have
done
with
it
i
can
t
help
thinking
alfred
that
she
s
disappointed
you
didn
t
ask
him
to
come
yule
stared
at
her
in
slight
surprise
he
was
still
not
angry
and
seemed
quite
willing
to
consider
this
matter
suggested
to
him
so
timorously
oh
you
think
so
well
i
don
t
know
why
should
i
have
asked
him
it
was
only
because
miss
harrow
seemed
to
wish
it
that
i
saw
him
down
there
i
have
no
particular
interest
in
him
and
as
for
he
broke
off
and
seated
himself
mrs
yule
stood
at
a
distance
we
must
remember
her
age
she
said
why
yes
of
he
mused
and
began
to
nibble
a
biscuit
and
you
know
alfred
she
never
does
meet
any
young
men
i
ve
often
thought
it
wasn
t
right
to
h
m
but
this
lad
milvain
is
a
very
doubtful
sort
of
customer
to
begin
with
he
has
nothing
and
they
tell
me
his
mother
for
the
most
part
supports
him
i
don
t
quite
approve
of
that
she
isn
t
well
off
and
he
ought
to
have
been
making
a
living
by
now
he
has
a
kind
of
cleverness
may
do
something
but
there
s
no
being
sure
of
these
thoughts
were
not
coming
into
his
mind
for
the
first
time
on
the
occasion
when
he
met
milvain
and
marian
together
in
the
country
road
he
had
necessarily
reflected
upon
the
possibilities
of
such
intercourse
and
with
the
issue
that
he
did
not
care
to
give
any
particular
encouragement
to
its
continuance
he
of
course
heard
of
milvain
s
call
and
he
purposely
refrained
from
seeing
the
young
man
after
that
the
matter
took
no
very
clear
shape
in
his
meditations
he
saw
no
likelihood
that
either
of
the
young
people
would
think
much
of
the
other
after
their
parting
and
time
enough
to
trouble
one
s
head
with
such
subjects
when
they
could
no
longer
be
postponed
it
would
not
have
been
pleasant
to
him
to
foresee
a
life
of
spinsterhood
for
his
daughter
but
she
was
young
and
she
was
a
valuable
assistant
how
far
did
that
latter
consideration
weigh
with
him
he
put
the
question
pretty
distinctly
to
himself
now
that
his
wife
had
broached
the
matter
thus
unexpectedly
was
he
prepared
to
behave
with
deliberate
selfishness
never
yet
had
any
conflict
been
manifested
between
his
interests
and
marian
s
practically
he
was
in
the
habit
of
counting
upon
her
aid
for
an
indefinite
period
if
indeed
he
became
editor
of
the
study
why
in
that
case
her
assistance
would
be
less
needful
and
indeed
it
seemed
probable
that
young
milvain
had
a
future
before
him
but
in
any
case
he
said
aloud
partly
continuing
his
thoughts
partly
replying
to
a
look
of
disappointment
on
his
wife
s
face
how
do
you
know
that
he
has
any
wish
to
come
and
see
marian
i
don
t
know
anything
about
it
of
and
you
may
have
made
a
mistake
about
her
what
made
you
think
she
had
him
in
mind
well
it
was
her
way
of
speaking
you
know
and
then
she
asked
if
you
had
got
a
dislike
to
she
did
h
m
well
i
don
t
think
milvain
is
any
good
to
marian
he
s
just
the
kind
of
man
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
a
girl
for
the
fun
of
the
mrs
yule
looked
alarmed
oh
if
you
really
think
that
don
t
let
him
come
i
wouldn
t
for
i
don
t
say
it
for
he
took
a
sip
of
his
coffee
i
have
had
no
opportunity
of
observing
him
with
much
attention
but
he
s
not
the
kind
of
man
i
care
then
no
doubt
it
s
better
as
it
yes
i
don
t
see
that
anything
could
be
done
now
we
shall
see
whether
he
gets
on
i
advise
you
not
to
mention
him
to
oh
no
i
won
she
moved
as
if
to
go
away
but
her
heart
had
been
made
uneasy
by
that
short
conversation
which
followed
on
marian
s
reading
the
letter
and
there
were
still
things
she
wished
to
put
into
words
if
those
young
ladies
go
on
writing
to
her
i
dare
say
they
ll
often
speak
about
their
yes
it
s
rather
and
you
know
alfred
he
may
have
asked
them
to
do
i
suppose
there
s
one
subject
on
which
all
women
can
be
subtle
muttered
yule
smiling
the
remark
was
not
a
kind
one
but
he
did
not
make
it
worse
by
his
tone
the
listener
failed
to
understand
him
and
looked
with
her
familiar
expression
of
mental
effort
we
can
t
help
that
he
added
with
reference
to
her
suggestion
if
he
has
any
serious
thoughts
well
let
him
go
on
and
wait
for
it
s
a
great
pity
isn
t
it
that
she
can
t
see
more
people
of
the
right
kind
no
use
talking
about
it
things
are
as
they
are
i
can
t
see
that
her
life
is
it
isn
t
very
you
think
not
i
m
sure
it
isn
if
i
get
the
study
things
may
be
different
though
but
it
s
no
use
talking
about
what
can
t
be
helped
now
don
t
you
go
encouraging
her
to
think
herself
lonely
and
so
on
it
s
best
for
her
to
keep
close
to
work
i
m
sure
of
perhaps
it
i
ll
think
it
mrs
yule
silently
left
the
room
and
went
back
to
her
sewing
she
had
understood
that
though
and
the
what
can
t
be
such
allusions
reminded
her
of
a
time
unhappier
than
the
present
when
she
had
been
wont
to
hear
plainer
language
she
knew
too
well
that
had
she
been
a
woman
of
education
her
daughter
would
not
now
be
suffering
from
loneliness
it
was
her
own
choice
that
she
did
not
go
with
her
husband
and
marian
to
john
yule
s
she
made
an
excuse
that
the
house
could
not
be
left
to
one
servant
but
in
any
case
she
would
have
remained
at
home
for
her
presence
must
needs
be
an
embarrassment
both
to
father
and
daughter
alfred
was
always
ashamed
of
her
before
strangers
he
could
not
conceal
his
feeling
either
from
her
or
from
other
people
who
had
reason
for
observing
him
marian
was
not
perhaps
ashamed
but
such
companionship
put
restraint
upon
her
freedom
and
would
it
not
always
be
the
same
supposing
mr
milvain
were
to
come
to
this
house
would
it
not
repel
him
when
he
found
what
sort
of
person
marian
s
mother
was
she
shed
a
few
tears
over
her
needlework
at
midnight
the
study
door
opened
yule
came
to
the
to
see
that
all
was
right
and
it
surprised
him
to
find
his
wife
still
sitting
there
why
are
you
so
late
i
ve
forgot
the
forgotten
forgotten
don
t
go
back
to
that
kind
of
language
again
come
put
the
light
part
two
chapter
viii
to
the
winning
side
of
the
acquaintances
yule
had
retained
from
his
earlier
years
several
were
in
the
category
of
men
with
unpresentable
wives
there
was
hinks
for
instance
whom
though
in
anger
he
spoke
of
him
as
a
bore
alfred
held
in
some
genuine
regard
hinks
made
perhaps
a
hundred
a
year
out
of
a
kind
of
writing
which
only
certain
publishers
can
get
rid
of
and
of
this
income
he
spent
about
a
third
on
books
his
wife
was
the
daughter
of
a
laundress
in
whose
house
he
had
lodged
thirty
years
ago
when
new
to
london
but
already
with
hunger
they
lived
in
complete
harmony
but
mrs
hinks
who
was
four
years
the
elder
still
spoke
the
laundress
tongue
unmitigated
and
immitigable
another
pair
were
mr
and
mrs
gorbutt
in
this
case
there
were
no
narrow
circumstances
to
contend
with
for
the
wife
originally
a
nursemaid
not
long
after
her
marriage
inherited
house
property
from
a
relative
mr
gorbutt
deemed
himself
a
poet
since
his
accession
to
an
income
he
had
published
at
his
own
expense
a
yearly
volume
of
verses
the
only
result
being
to
keep
alive
rancour
in
his
wife
who
was
both
parsimonious
and
vain
making
no
secret
of
it
mrs
gorbutt
rued
the
day
on
which
she
had
wedded
a
man
of
letters
when
by
waiting
so
short
a
time
she
would
have
been
enabled
to
aim
at
a
prosperous
tradesman
who
kept
his
gig
and
had
everything
handsome
about
him
mrs
yule
suspected
not
without
reason
that
this
lady
had
an
inclination
to
strong
liquors
thirdly
came
mr
and
mrs
christopherson
who
were
poor
as
church
mice
even
in
a
friend
s
house
they
wrangled
incessantly
and
made
revelations
of
their
home
life
the
husband
worked
casually
at
irresponsible
journalism
but
his
chosen
study
was
metaphysics
for
many
years
he
had
had
a
huge
and
profound
book
on
hand
which
he
believed
would
bring
him
fame
though
he
was
not
so
unsettled
in
mind
as
to
hope
for
anything
else
when
an
article
or
two
had
earned
enough
money
for
immediate
necessities
he
went
off
to
the
british
museum
and
then
the
difficulty
was
to
recall
him
to
profitable
exertions
yet
husband
and
wife
had
an
affection
for
each
other
mrs
christopherson
came
from
camberwell
where
her
father
once
upon
a
time
was
the
smallest
of
small
butchers
disagreeable
stories
were
whispered
concerning
her
earlier
life
and
probably
the
metaphysician
did
not
care
to
look
back
in
that
direction
they
had
had
three
children
all
were
happily
buried
these
men
were
capable
of
better
things
than
they
had
done
or
would
ever
do
in
each
case
their
failure
to
fulfil
youthful
promise
was
largely
explained
by
the
unpresentable
wife
they
should
have
waited
they
might
have
married
a
social
equal
at
something
between
fifty
and
sixty
another
old
friend
was
mr
quarmby
unwedded
he
and
perpetually
exultant
over
men
who
as
he
phrased
it
had
noosed
themselves
he
made
a
fair
living
but
like
dr
johnson
had
no
passion
for
clean
linen
yule
was
not
disdainful
of
these
old
companions
and
the
fact
that
all
had
a
habit
of
looking
up
to
him
increased
his
pleasure
in
their
occasional
society
if
as
happened
once
or
twice
in
half
a
year
several
of
them
were
gathered
together
at
his
house
he
tasted
a
sham
kind
of
social
and
intellectual
authority
which
he
could
not
help
relishing
on
such
occasions
he
threw
off
his
habitual
gloom
and
talked
vigorously
making
natural
display
of
his
learning
and
critical
ability
the
topic
sooner
or
later
was
that
which
is
inevitable
in
such
a
circle
the
demerits
the
pretentiousness
the
personal
weaknesses
of
prominent
contemporaries
in
the
world
of
letters
then
did
the
room
ring
with
scornful
laughter
with
boisterous
satire
with
shouted
irony
with
fierce
invective
after
an
evening
of
that
kind
yule
was
unwell
and
miserable
for
several
days
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
mr
quarmby
inveterate
chatterbox
of
the
and
other
resorts
should
keep
silence
concerning
what
he
had
heard
of
mr
rackett
s
intentions
the
rumour
soon
spread
that
alfred
yule
was
to
succeed
fadge
in
the
direction
of
the
study
with
the
necessary
consequence
that
yule
found
himself
an
object
of
affectionate
interest
to
a
great
many
people
of
whom
he
knew
little
or
nothing
at
the
same
time
the
genuine
old
friends
pressed
warmly
about
him
with
congratulations
with
hints
of
their
sincere
readiness
to
assist
in
filling
the
columns
of
the
paper
all
this
was
not
disagreeable
but
in
the
meantime
yule
had
heard
nothing
whatever
from
mr
rackett
himself
and
his
doubts
did
not
diminish
as
week
after
week
went
by
the
event
justified
him
at
the
end
of
october
appeared
an
authoritative
announcement
that
fadge
s
successor
would
be
not
alfred
yule
but
a
gentleman
who
till
of
late
had
been
quietly
working
as
a
in
the
provinces
and
who
had
neither
friendships
nor
enmities
among
the
people
of
the
london
literary
press
a
young
man
comparatively
fresh
from
the
university
and
said
to
be
strong
in
pure
scholarship
the
choice
as
you
are
aware
proved
a
good
one
and
the
study
became
an
organ
of
more
repute
than
ever
yule
had
been
secretly
conscious
that
it
was
not
to
men
such
as
he
that
positions
of
this
kind
are
nowadays
entrusted
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
he
was
not
disappointed
but
when
mr
quarmby
approached
him
with
blank
face
he
spoke
certain
wrathful
words
which
long
rankled
in
that
worthy
s
mind
at
home
he
kept
sullen
silence
no
not
to
such
men
as
he
poor
and
without
social
recommendations
besides
he
was
growing
too
old
in
literature
as
in
most
other
pursuits
the
press
of
energetic
young
men
was
making
it
very
hard
for
a
veteran
even
to
hold
the
little
he
had
won
by
hard
fighting
still
quarmby
s
story
had
not
been
without
foundation
it
was
true
that
the
proprietor
of
the
study
had
for
a
moment
thought
of
alfred
yule
doubtless
as
the
natural
contrast
to
clement
fadge
whom
he
would
have
liked
to
mortify
if
the
thing
were
possible
but
counsellors
had
proved
to
mr
rackett
the
disadvantages
of
such
a
choice
mrs
yule
and
her
daughter
foresaw
but
too
well
the
results
of
this
disappointment
notwithstanding
that
alfred
announced
it
to
them
with
dry
indifference
the
month
that
followed
was
a
time
of
misery
for
all
in
the
house
day
after
day
yule
sat
at
his
meals
in
sullen
muteness
to
his
wife
he
scarcely
spoke
at
all
and
his
conversation
with
marian
did
not
go
beyond
necessary
questions
and
remarks
on
topics
of
business
his
face
became
so
strange
a
colour
that
one
would
have
thought
him
suffering
from
an
attack
of
jaundice
bilious
headaches
exasperated
his
savage
mood
mrs
yule
knew
from
long
experience
how
worse
than
useless
it
was
for
her
to
attempt
consolation
in
silence
was
her
only
safety
nor
did
marian
venture
to
speak
directly
of
what
had
happened
but
one
evening
when
she
had
been
engaged
in
the
study
and
was
now
saying
she
laid
her
cheek
against
her
father
s
an
unwonted
caress
which
had
a
strange
effect
upon
him
the
expression
of
sympathy
caused
his
thoughts
to
reveal
themselves
as
they
never
yet
had
done
before
his
daughter
it
might
have
been
very
different
with
me
he
exclaimed
abruptly
as
if
they
had
already
been
conversing
on
the
subject
when
you
think
of
my
failures
and
you
must
often
do
so
now
you
are
grown
up
and
understand
things
don
t
forget
the
obstacles
that
have
been
in
my
way
i
don
t
like
you
to
look
upon
your
father
as
a
thickhead
who
couldn
t
be
expected
to
succeed
look
at
fadge
he
married
a
woman
of
good
social
position
she
brought
him
friends
and
influence
but
for
that
he
would
never
have
been
editor
of
the
study
a
place
for
which
he
wasn
t
in
the
least
fit
but
he
was
able
to
give
dinners
he
and
his
wife
went
into
society
everybody
knew
him
and
talked
of
him
how
has
it
been
with
me
i
live
here
like
an
animal
in
its
hole
and
go
blinking
about
if
by
chance
i
find
myself
among
the
people
with
whom
i
ought
naturally
to
associate
if
i
had
been
able
to
come
in
direct
contact
with
rackett
and
other
men
of
that
kind
to
dine
with
them
and
have
them
to
dine
with
me
to
belong
to
a
club
and
so
on
i
shouldn
t
be
what
i
am
at
my
age
my
one
opportunity
when
i
edited
the
balance
wasn
t
worth
much
there
was
no
money
behind
the
paper
we
couldn
t
hold
out
long
enough
but
even
then
if
i
could
have
assumed
my
proper
social
standing
if
i
could
have
opened
my
house
freely
to
the
right
kind
of
people
how
was
it
possible
marian
could
not
raise
her
head
she
recognised
the
portion
of
truth
in
what
he
said
but
it
shocked
her
that
he
should
allow
himself
to
speak
thus
her
silence
seemed
to
remind
him
how
painful
it
must
be
to
her
to
hear
these
accusations
of
her
mother
and
with
a
sudden
he
dismissed
her
she
went
up
to
her
room
and
wept
over
the
wretchedness
of
all
their
lives
her
loneliness
had
seemed
harder
to
bear
than
ever
since
that
last
holiday
for
a
moment
in
the
lanes
about
finden
there
had
come
to
her
a
vision
of
joy
such
as
fate
owed
her
youth
but
it
had
faded
and
she
could
no
longer
hope
for
its
return
she
was
not
a
woman
but
a
mere
machine
for
reading
and
writing
did
her
father
never
think
of
this
he
was
not
the
only
one
to
suffer
from
the
circumstances
in
which
poverty
had
involved
him
she
had
no
friends
to
whom
she
could
utter
her
thoughts
dora
milvain
had
written
a
second
time
and
more
recently
had
come
a
letter
from
maud
but
in
replying
to
them
she
could
not
give
a
true
account
of
herself
impossible
to
them
from
what
she
wrote
they
would
imagine
her
contentedly
busy
absorbed
in
the
affairs
of
literature
to
no
one
could
she
make
known
the
aching
sadness
of
her
heart
the
dreariness
of
life
as
it
lay
before
her
that
beginning
of
between
her
and
her
mother
had
led
to
nothing
mrs
yule
found
no
second
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
husband
about
jasper
milvain
and
purposely
she
refrained
from
any
further
hint
or
question
to
marian
everything
must
go
on
as
hitherto
the
days
darkened
through
november
rains
and
fogs
marian
went
her
usual
way
to
the
museum
and
toiled
there
among
the
other
toilers
perhaps
once
a
week
she
allowed
herself
to
stray
about
the
alleys
of
the
scanning
furtively
those
who
sat
at
the
desks
but
the
face
she
might
perchance
have
discovered
was
not
there
one
day
at
the
end
of
the
month
she
sat
with
books
open
before
her
but
by
no
effort
could
fix
her
attention
upon
them
it
was
gloomy
and
one
could
scarcely
see
to
read
a
taste
of
fog
grew
perceptible
in
the
warm
headachy
air
such
profound
discouragement
possessed
her
that
she
could
not
even
maintain
the
pretence
of
study
heedless
whether
anyone
observed
her
she
let
her
hands
fall
and
her
head
droop
she
kept
asking
herself
what
was
the
use
and
purpose
of
such
a
life
as
she
was
condemned
to
lead
when
already
there
was
more
good
literature
in
the
world
than
any
mortal
could
cope
with
in
his
lifetime
here
was
she
exhausting
herself
in
the
manufacture
of
printed
stuff
which
no
one
even
pretended
to
be
more
than
a
commodity
for
the
day
s
market
what
unspeakable
folly
to
write
was
not
that
the
joy
and
the
privilege
of
one
who
had
an
urgent
message
for
the
world
her
father
she
knew
well
had
no
such
message
he
had
abandoned
all
thought
of
original
production
and
only
wrote
about
writing
she
herself
would
throw
away
her
pen
with
joy
but
for
the
need
of
earning
money
and
all
these
people
about
her
what
aim
had
they
save
to
make
new
books
out
of
those
already
existing
that
yet
newer
books
might
in
turn
be
made
out
of
theirs
this
huge
library
growing
into
unwieldiness
threatening
to
become
a
trackless
desert
of
print
how
intolerably
it
weighed
upon
the
spirit
oh
to
go
forth
and
labour
with
one
s
hands
to
do
any
poorest
commonest
work
of
which
the
world
had
truly
need
it
was
ignoble
to
sit
here
and
support
the
paltry
pretence
of
intellectual
dignity
a
few
days
ago
her
startled
eye
had
caught
an
advertisement
in
the
newspaper
headed
literary
machine
had
it
then
been
invented
at
last
some
automaton
to
supply
the
place
of
such
poor
creatures
as
herself
to
turn
out
books
and
articles
alas
the
machine
was
only
one
for
holding
volumes
conveniently
that
the
work
of
literary
manufacture
might
be
physically
lightened
but
surely
before
long
some
edison
would
make
the
true
automaton
the
problem
must
be
comparatively
such
a
simple
one
only
to
throw
in
a
given
number
of
old
books
and
have
them
reduced
blended
modernised
into
a
single
one
for
s
consumption
the
fog
grew
thicker
she
looked
up
at
the
windows
beneath
the
dome
and
saw
that
they
were
a
dusky
yellow
then
her
eye
discerned
an
official
walking
along
the
upper
gallery
and
in
pursuance
of
her
grotesque
humour
her
mocking
misery
she
likened
him
to
a
black
lost
soul
doomed
to
wander
in
an
eternity
of
vain
research
along
endless
shelves
or
again
the
readers
who
sat
here
at
these
radiating
lines
of
desks
what
were
they
but
hapless
flies
caught
in
a
huge
web
its
nucleus
the
great
circle
of
the
catalogue
darker
darker
from
the
towering
wall
of
volumes
seemed
to
emanate
visible
motes
intensifying
the
obscurity
in
a
moment
the
circumference
of
the
room
would
be
but
a
featureless
but
then
flashed
forth
the
sputtering
whiteness
of
the
electric
light
and
its
ceaseless
hum
was
henceforth
a
new
source
of
headache
it
reminded
her
how
little
work
she
had
done
she
must
she
must
force
herself
to
think
of
the
task
in
hand
a
machine
has
no
business
to
refuse
its
duty
but
the
pages
were
blue
and
green
and
yellow
before
her
eyes
the
uncertainty
of
the
light
was
intolerable
right
or
wrong
she
would
go
home
and
hide
herself
and
let
her
heart
unburden
itself
of
tears
on
her
way
to
return
books
she
encountered
jasper
milvain
face
to
face
no
possibility
of
his
avoiding
her
and
indeed
he
seemed
to
have
no
such
wish
his
countenance
lighted
up
with
unmistakable
pleasure
at
last
we
meet
as
they
say
in
the
melodramas
oh
do
let
me
help
you
with
those
volumes
which
won
t
even
let
you
shake
hands
how
do
you
do
how
do
you
like
this
weather
and
how
do
you
like
this
light
it
s
very
that
ll
do
both
for
weather
and
light
but
not
for
yourself
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
are
you
just
going
i
have
scarcely
been
here
times
since
i
came
back
to
but
you
are
writing
still
oh
yes
but
i
draw
upon
my
genius
and
my
stores
of
observation
and
the
living
marian
received
her
vouchers
for
the
volumes
and
turned
to
face
jasper
again
there
was
a
smile
on
her
lips
the
fog
is
terrible
milvain
went
on
how
do
you
get
home
by
omnibus
from
tottenham
court
then
do
let
me
go
a
part
of
the
way
with
you
i
live
in
mornington
road
up
yonder
you
know
i
have
only
just
come
in
to
waste
half
an
hour
and
after
all
i
think
i
should
be
better
at
home
your
father
is
all
right
i
hope
he
is
not
quite
i
m
sorry
to
hear
that
you
are
not
exactly
up
to
the
mark
either
what
weather
what
a
place
to
live
in
this
london
in
winter
it
would
be
a
little
better
down
at
a
good
deal
better
i
should
think
if
the
weather
were
bad
it
would
be
bad
in
a
natural
way
but
this
is
artificial
i
don
t
let
it
affect
me
much
said
milvain
just
of
late
i
have
been
in
remarkably
good
spirits
i
m
doing
a
lot
of
work
no
end
of
work
more
than
i
ve
ever
i
am
very
where
are
your
things
i
think
there
s
a
ladies
vestry
somewhere
isn
t
there
oh
then
will
you
go
and
get
ready
i
ll
wait
for
you
in
the
hall
but
i
am
taking
it
for
granted
that
you
were
going
i
was
quite
the
quite
seemed
excessive
it
made
jasper
smile
and
also
he
added
that
i
shall
not
annoy
you
by
offering
my
company
why
should
it
annoy
me
good
milvain
had
only
to
wait
a
minute
or
two
he
surveyed
marian
from
head
to
foot
when
she
appeared
an
impertinence
as
unintentional
as
that
occasionally
noticeable
in
his
speech
and
smiled
approval
they
went
out
into
the
fog
which
was
not
one
of
london
s
densest
but
made
walking
disagreeable
enough
you
have
heard
from
the
girls
i
think
jasper
resumed
your
sisters
yes
they
have
been
so
kind
as
to
write
to
told
you
all
about
their
great
work
i
hope
it
ll
be
finished
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
bits
they
have
sent
me
will
do
very
well
indeed
i
knew
they
had
it
in
them
to
put
sentences
together
now
i
want
them
to
think
of
patching
up
something
or
other
for
the
english
girl
you
know
the
paper
i
have
heard
of
i
happen
to
know
mrs
boston
wright
who
edits
it
met
her
at
a
house
the
other
day
and
told
her
frankly
that
she
would
have
to
give
my
sisters
something
to
do
it
s
the
only
way
to
get
on
one
has
to
take
it
for
granted
that
people
are
willing
to
help
you
i
have
made
a
host
of
new
acquaintances
just
i
m
glad
to
hear
it
said
marian
do
you
know
but
how
should
you
i
am
going
to
write
for
the
new
magazine
the
indeed
edited
by
that
man
your
father
has
no
affection
for
him
i
he
has
no
reason
to
have
mr
no
no
fadge
is
an
offensive
fellow
when
he
likes
and
i
fancy
he
very
often
does
like
well
i
must
make
what
use
of
him
i
can
you
won
t
think
worse
of
me
because
i
write
for
him
i
know
that
one
can
t
exercise
choice
in
such
true
i
shouldn
t
like
to
think
that
you
regard
me
as
a
individual
a
natural
marian
laughed
there
s
no
danger
of
my
thinking
but
the
fog
was
making
their
eyes
water
and
getting
into
their
throats
by
when
they
reached
tottenham
court
road
they
were
both
thoroughly
uncomfortable
the
bus
had
to
be
waited
for
and
in
the
meantime
they
talked
scrappily
coughily
in
the
vehicle
things
were
a
little
better
but
here
one
could
not
converse
with
freedom
what
pestilent
conditions
of
life
exclaimed
jasper
putting
his
face
rather
near
to
marian
s
i
wish
to
goodness
we
were
back
in
those
quiet
fields
you
remember
with
the
september
sun
warm
about
us
shall
you
go
to
finden
again
before
long
i
really
don
t
i
m
sorry
to
say
my
mother
is
far
from
well
in
any
case
i
must
go
at
christmas
but
i
m
afraid
it
won
t
be
a
cheerful
arrived
in
hampstead
road
he
offered
his
hand
for
i
wanted
to
talk
about
all
sorts
of
things
but
perhaps
i
shall
find
you
again
some
he
jumped
out
and
waved
his
hat
in
the
lurid
fog
shortly
before
the
end
of
december
appeared
the
first
number
of
the
current
yule
had
once
or
twice
referred
to
the
forthcoming
magazine
with
acrid
contempt
and
of
course
he
did
not
purchase
a
copy
so
young
milvain
has
joined
fadge
s
hopeful
standard
he
remarked
a
day
or
two
later
at
breakfast
they
say
his
paper
is
remarkably
clever
i
could
wish
it
had
appeared
anywhere
else
evil
communications
but
i
shouldn
t
think
there
s
any
personal
connection
said
marian
very
likely
not
but
milvain
has
been
invited
to
contribute
you
see
do
you
think
he
ought
to
have
refused
oh
no
it
s
nothing
to
me
nothing
mrs
yule
glanced
at
her
daughter
but
marian
seemed
unconcerned
the
subject
was
dismissed
in
introducing
it
yule
had
had
his
purpose
there
had
always
been
an
unnatural
avoidance
of
milvain
s
name
in
conversation
and
he
wished
to
have
an
end
of
this
hitherto
he
had
felt
a
troublesome
uncertainty
regarding
his
position
in
the
matter
from
what
his
wife
had
told
him
it
seemed
pretty
certain
that
marian
was
disappointed
by
the
abrupt
closing
of
her
brief
acquaintance
with
the
young
man
and
yule
s
affection
for
his
daughter
caused
him
to
feel
uneasy
in
the
thought
that
perhaps
he
had
deprived
her
of
a
chance
of
happiness
his
conscience
readily
took
hold
of
an
excuse
for
justifying
the
course
he
had
followed
milvain
had
gone
over
to
the
enemy
whether
or
not
the
young
man
understood
how
relentless
the
hostility
was
between
yule
and
fadge
mattered
little
the
probability
was
that
he
knew
all
about
it
in
any
case
intimate
relations
with
him
could
not
have
survived
this
alliance
with
fadge
so
that
after
all
there
had
been
wisdom
in
letting
the
acquaintance
lapse
to
be
sure
nothing
could
have
come
of
it
milvain
was
the
kind
of
man
who
weighed
opportunities
every
step
he
took
would
be
regulated
by
considerations
of
advantage
at
all
events
that
was
the
impression
his
character
had
made
upon
yule
any
hopes
that
marian
might
have
been
induced
to
form
would
assuredly
have
ended
in
disappointment
it
was
kindness
to
interpose
before
things
had
gone
so
far
henceforth
if
milvain
s
name
was
unavoidable
it
should
be
mentioned
just
like
that
of
any
other
literary
man
it
seemed
very
unlikely
indeed
that
marian
would
continue
to
think
of
him
with
any
special
and
personal
interest
the
fact
of
her
having
got
into
correspondence
with
his
sisters
was
unfortunate
but
this
kind
of
thing
rarely
went
on
for
very
long
yule
spoke
of
the
matter
with
his
wife
that
evening
has
marian
heard
from
those
girls
at
finden
lately
she
had
a
letter
one
afternoon
last
do
you
see
these
letters
no
she
told
me
what
was
in
them
at
first
but
now
she
doesn
she
hasn
t
spoken
to
you
again
of
milvain
not
a
well
i
understood
what
i
was
about
yule
remarked
with
the
confident
air
of
one
who
doesn
t
wish
to
remember
that
he
had
ever
felt
doubtful
there
was
no
good
in
having
the
fellow
here
he
has
got
in
with
a
set
that
i
don
t
at
all
care
for
if
she
ever
says
anything
you
understand
you
can
just
let
me
marian
had
already
procured
a
copy
of
the
current
and
read
it
privately
of
the
cleverness
of
milvain
s
contribution
there
could
be
no
two
opinions
it
drew
the
attention
of
the
public
and
all
notices
of
the
new
magazine
made
special
reference
to
this
article
with
keen
interest
marian
sought
after
comments
of
the
press
when
it
was
possible
she
cut
them
out
and
put
them
carefully
away
january
passed
and
february
she
saw
nothing
of
jasper
a
letter
from
dora
in
the
first
week
of
march
made
announcement
that
the
child
s
history
of
the
english
parliament
would
be
published
very
shortly
it
told
her
too
that
mrs
milvain
had
been
very
ill
indeed
but
that
she
seemed
to
recover
a
little
strength
as
the
weather
improved
of
jasper
there
was
no
mention
a
week
later
came
the
news
that
mrs
milvain
had
suddenly
died
this
letter
was
received
at
the
envelope
was
an
ordinary
one
and
so
little
did
marian
anticipate
the
nature
of
its
contents
that
at
the
first
sight
of
the
words
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
pain
her
father
who
had
turned
from
the
table
to
the
fireside
with
his
newspaper
looked
round
and
asked
what
was
the
matter
mrs
milvain
died
the
day
before
indeed
he
averted
his
face
again
and
seemed
disposed
to
say
no
more
but
in
a
few
moments
he
inquired
what
are
her
daughters
likely
to
do
i
have
no
do
you
know
anything
of
their
circumstances
i
believe
they
will
have
to
depend
upon
nothing
more
was
said
afterwards
mrs
yule
made
a
few
sympathetic
inquiries
but
marian
was
very
brief
in
her
replies
ten
days
after
that
on
a
sunday
afternoon
when
marian
and
her
mother
were
alone
in
the
they
heard
the
knock
of
a
visitor
at
the
front
door
yule
was
out
and
there
was
no
likelihood
of
the
visitor
s
wishing
to
see
anyone
but
him
they
listened
the
servant
went
to
the
door
and
after
a
murmur
of
voices
came
to
speak
to
her
mistress
it
s
a
gentleman
called
mr
milvain
the
girl
reported
in
a
way
that
proved
how
seldom
callers
presented
themselves
he
asked
for
mr
yule
and
when
i
said
he
was
out
then
he
asked
for
miss
mother
and
daughter
looked
anxiously
at
each
other
mrs
yule
was
nervous
and
helpless
show
mr
milvain
into
the
study
said
marian
with
sudden
decision
are
you
going
to
see
him
there
asked
her
mother
in
a
hurried
whisper
i
thought
you
would
prefer
that
to
his
coming
in
yes
yes
but
suppose
father
comes
back
before
he
s
gone
what
will
it
matter
you
forget
that
he
asked
for
father
oh
yes
then
don
t
marian
scarcely
less
agitated
than
her
mother
was
just
leaving
the
room
when
she
turned
back
again
if
father
comes
in
you
will
tell
him
before
he
goes
into
the
study
yes
i
the
fire
in
the
study
was
on
the
point
of
extinction
this
was
the
first
thing
marian
s
eye
perceived
on
entering
and
it
gave
her
assurance
that
her
father
would
not
be
back
for
some
hours
evidently
he
had
intended
it
to
go
out
small
economies
of
this
kind
unintelligible
to
people
who
have
always
lived
at
ease
had
been
the
rule
with
him
with
a
sensation
of
gladness
at
having
free
time
before
her
marian
turned
to
where
milvain
was
standing
in
front
of
one
of
the
bookcases
he
wore
no
symbol
of
mourning
but
his
countenance
was
far
graver
than
usual
and
rather
paler
they
shook
hands
in
silence
i
am
so
grieved
marian
began
with
broken
voice
thank
you
i
know
the
girls
have
told
you
all
about
it
we
knew
for
the
last
month
that
it
must
come
before
long
though
there
was
a
deceptive
improvement
just
before
the
please
to
sit
down
mr
milvain
father
went
out
not
long
ago
and
i
don
t
think
he
will
be
back
very
it
was
not
really
mr
yule
i
wished
to
see
said
jasper
frankly
if
he
had
been
at
home
i
should
have
spoken
with
him
about
what
i
have
in
mind
but
if
you
will
kindly
give
me
a
few
minutes
it
will
be
much
marian
glanced
at
the
expiring
fire
her
curiosity
as
to
what
milvain
had
to
say
was
mingled
with
an
anxious
doubt
whether
it
was
not
too
late
to
put
on
fresh
coals
already
the
room
was
growing
very
chill
and
this
appearance
of
inhospitality
troubled
her
do
you
wish
to
save
it
jasper
asked
understanding
her
look
and
movement
i
m
afraid
it
has
got
too
i
think
not
life
in
lodgings
has
made
me
skilful
at
this
kind
of
thing
let
me
try
my
he
took
the
tongs
and
carefully
disposed
small
pieces
of
coal
upon
the
glow
that
remained
marian
stood
apart
with
a
feeling
of
shame
and
annoyance
but
it
is
so
seldom
that
situations
in
life
arrange
themselves
with
dramatic
propriety
and
after
all
this
vulgar
necessity
made
the
beginning
of
the
conversation
easier
that
will
be
all
right
now
said
jasper
at
length
as
little
tongues
of
flame
began
to
shoot
here
and
there
marian
said
nothing
but
seated
herself
and
waited
i
came
up
to
town
yesterday
jasper
began
of
course
we
have
had
a
great
deal
to
do
and
think
about
miss
harrow
has
been
very
kind
indeed
to
the
girls
so
have
several
of
our
old
friends
in
wattleborough
it
was
necessary
to
decide
at
once
what
maud
and
dora
are
going
to
do
and
it
is
on
their
account
that
i
have
come
to
see
you
the
listener
kept
silence
with
a
face
of
sympathetic
attention
we
have
made
up
our
minds
that
they
may
as
well
come
to
london
it
s
a
bold
step
i
m
by
no
means
sure
that
the
result
will
justify
it
but
i
think
they
are
perhaps
right
in
wishing
to
try
they
will
go
on
with
literary
work
well
it
s
our
hope
that
they
may
be
able
to
of
course
there
s
no
chance
of
their
earning
enough
to
live
upon
for
some
time
but
the
matter
stands
like
this
they
have
a
trifling
sum
of
money
on
which
at
a
pinch
they
could
live
in
london
for
perhaps
a
year
and
a
half
in
that
time
they
may
find
their
way
to
a
sort
of
income
at
all
events
the
chances
are
that
a
year
and
a
half
hence
i
shall
be
able
to
help
them
to
keep
body
and
soul
the
money
of
which
he
spoke
was
the
debt
owed
to
their
father
by
william
milvain
in
consequence
of
mrs
milvain
s
pressing
application
half
of
this
sum
had
at
length
been
paid
and
the
remainder
was
promised
in
a
year
s
time
greatly
to
jasper
s
astonishment
in
addition
there
would
be
the
trifle
realised
by
the
sale
of
furniture
though
most
of
this
might
have
to
go
in
payment
of
rent
unless
the
house
could
be
relet
immediately
they
have
made
a
good
beginning
said
marian
she
spoke
mechanically
for
it
was
impossible
to
keep
her
thoughts
under
control
if
maud
and
dora
came
to
live
in
london
it
might
bring
about
a
most
important
change
in
her
life
she
could
scarcely
imagine
the
happiness
of
having
two
such
friends
always
near
on
the
other
hand
how
would
it
be
regarded
by
her
father
she
was
at
a
loss
amid
conflicting
emotions
it
s
better
than
if
they
had
done
nothing
at
all
jasper
replied
to
her
remark
and
the
way
they
knocked
that
trifle
together
promises
well
they
did
it
very
quickly
and
in
a
far
more
workmanlike
way
than
i
should
have
thought
no
doubt
they
share
your
own
perhaps
so
of
course
i
know
that
i
have
talent
of
a
kind
though
i
don
t
rate
it
very
high
we
shall
have
to
see
whether
they
can
do
anything
more
than
mere
booksellers
work
they
are
both
very
young
you
know
i
think
they
may
be
able
to
write
something
that
ll
do
for
the
english
girl
and
no
doubt
i
can
hit
upon
a
second
idea
that
will
appeal
to
jolly
and
monk
at
all
events
they
ll
have
books
within
reach
and
better
opportunities
every
way
than
at
how
do
their
friends
in
the
country
think
of
it
very
dubiously
but
then
what
else
was
to
be
expected
of
course
the
respectable
and
intelligible
path
marked
out
for
both
of
them
points
to
a
lifetime
of
governessing
but
the
girls
have
no
relish
for
that
they
d
rather
do
almost
anything
we
talked
over
all
the
aspects
of
the
situation
seriously
enough
it
is
desperately
serious
no
doubt
of
that
i
told
them
fairly
all
the
hardships
they
would
have
to
face
described
the
typical
london
lodgings
and
so
on
still
there
s
an
adventurous
vein
in
them
and
they
decided
for
the
risk
if
it
came
to
the
worst
i
suppose
they
could
still
find
governess
let
us
hope
better
yes
but
now
i
should
have
felt
far
more
reluctant
to
let
them
come
here
in
this
way
hadn
t
it
been
that
they
regard
you
as
a
friend
morning
you
will
probably
hear
from
one
or
both
of
them
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
if
i
had
left
them
to
tell
you
all
this
but
i
felt
i
should
like
to
see
you
and
put
it
in
my
own
way
i
think
you
ll
understand
this
feeling
miss
yule
i
wanted
in
fact
to
hear
from
yourself
that
you
would
be
a
friend
to
the
poor
oh
you
already
know
that
i
shall
be
so
very
glad
to
see
them
marian
s
voice
lent
itself
very
naturally
and
sweetly
to
the
expression
of
warm
feeling
emphasis
was
not
her
habit
it
only
needed
that
she
should
put
off
her
ordinary
reserve
utter
quietly
the
emotional
thought
which
so
seldom
might
declare
itself
and
her
tones
had
an
exquisite
womanliness
jasper
looked
full
into
her
face
in
that
case
they
won
t
miss
the
comfort
of
home
so
much
of
course
they
will
have
to
go
into
very
modest
lodgings
indeed
i
have
already
been
looking
about
i
should
like
to
find
rooms
for
them
somewhere
near
my
own
place
it
s
a
decent
neighbourhood
and
the
park
is
at
hand
and
then
they
wouldn
t
be
very
far
from
you
they
thought
it
might
be
possible
to
make
a
joint
establishment
with
me
but
i
m
afraid
that
s
out
of
the
question
the
lodgings
we
should
want
in
that
case
everything
considered
would
cost
more
than
the
sum
of
our
expenses
if
we
live
apart
besides
there
s
no
harm
in
saying
that
i
don
t
think
we
should
get
along
very
well
together
we
re
all
of
us
rather
quarrelsome
to
tell
the
truth
and
we
try
each
other
s
marian
smiled
and
looked
puzzled
shouldn
t
you
have
thought
that
i
have
seen
no
signs
of
i
m
not
sure
that
the
worst
fault
is
on
my
side
why
should
one
condemn
oneself
against
conscience
maud
is
perhaps
the
hardest
to
get
along
with
she
has
a
sort
of
arrogance
an
exaggeration
of
something
i
am
quite
aware
of
in
myself
you
have
noticed
that
trait
in
me
arrogance
i
think
not
you
have
which
goes
into
extremes
now
and
then
but
putting
myself
aside
i
feel
pretty
sure
that
the
girls
won
t
seem
quarrelsome
to
you
they
would
have
to
be
very
fractious
indeed
before
that
were
we
shall
continue
to
be
friends
i
am
jasper
let
his
eyes
wander
about
the
room
this
is
your
father
s
study
perhaps
it
would
have
seemed
odd
to
mr
yule
if
i
had
come
in
and
begun
to
talk
to
him
about
these
purely
private
affairs
he
knows
me
so
very
slightly
but
in
calling
here
for
the
first
time
an
unusual
embarrassment
checked
him
i
will
explain
to
father
your
very
natural
wish
to
speak
of
these
things
said
marian
with
tact
she
thought
uneasily
of
her
mother
in
the
next
room
to
her
there
appeared
no
reason
whatever
why
jasper
should
not
be
introduced
to
mrs
yule
yet
she
could
not
venture
to
propose
it
remembering
her
father
s
last
remarks
about
milvain
in
connection
with
fadge
s
magazine
she
must
wait
for
distinct
permission
before
offering
the
young
man
encouragement
to
repeat
his
visit
perhaps
there
was
complicated
trouble
in
store
for
her
impossible
to
say
how
her
father
s
and
rankling
antipathies
might
affect
her
intercourse
even
with
the
two
girls
but
she
was
of
independent
years
she
must
be
allowed
the
choice
of
her
own
friends
the
pleasure
she
had
in
seeing
jasper
under
this
roof
in
hearing
him
talk
with
such
intimate
friendliness
strengthened
her
to
resist
timid
thoughts
when
will
your
sisters
arrive
she
asked
i
think
in
a
very
few
days
when
i
have
fixed
upon
lodgings
for
them
i
must
go
back
to
finden
then
they
will
return
with
me
as
soon
as
we
can
get
the
house
emptied
it
s
rather
miserable
selling
things
one
has
lived
among
from
childhood
a
friend
in
wattleborough
will
house
for
us
what
we
really
can
t
bear
to
part
it
must
be
very
sad
marian
murmured
you
know
said
the
other
suddenly
that
it
s
my
fault
the
girls
are
left
in
such
a
hard
position
marian
looked
at
him
with
startled
eyes
his
tone
was
quite
unfamiliar
to
her
mother
had
an
annuity
he
continued
it
ended
with
her
life
but
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
me
she
could
have
saved
a
good
deal
out
of
it
until
the
last
year
or
two
i
have
earned
nothing
and
i
have
spent
more
than
was
strictly
necessary
well
i
didn
t
live
like
that
in
mere
recklessness
i
knew
i
was
preparing
myself
for
remunerative
work
but
it
seems
too
bad
now
i
m
sorry
for
it
i
wish
i
had
found
some
way
of
supporting
myself
the
end
of
mother
s
life
was
made
far
more
unhappy
than
it
need
have
been
i
should
like
you
to
understand
all
the
listener
kept
her
eyes
on
the
ground
perhaps
the
girls
have
hinted
it
to
you
jasper
added
selfishness
that
s
one
of
my
faults
it
isn
t
a
brutal
kind
of
selfishness
the
thought
of
it
often
enough
troubles
me
if
i
were
rich
i
should
be
a
generous
and
good
man
i
know
i
should
so
would
many
another
poor
fellow
whose
worst
features
come
out
under
hardship
this
isn
t
a
heroic
type
of
course
not
i
am
a
civilised
man
that
s
marian
could
say
nothing
you
wonder
why
i
am
so
impertinent
as
to
talk
about
myself
like
this
i
have
gone
through
a
good
deal
of
mental
pain
these
last
few
weeks
and
somehow
i
can
t
help
showing
you
something
of
my
real
thoughts
just
because
you
are
one
of
the
few
people
i
regard
with
sincere
respect
i
don
t
know
you
very
well
but
quite
well
enough
to
respect
you
my
sisters
think
of
you
in
the
same
way
i
shall
do
many
a
base
thing
in
life
just
to
get
money
and
reputation
i
tell
you
this
that
you
mayn
t
be
surprised
if
anything
of
that
kind
comes
to
your
ears
i
can
t
afford
to
live
as
i
should
like
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
smile
people
who
are
going
to
live
unworthily
don
t
declare
it
in
this
i
oughtn
t
to
a
few
minutes
ago
i
had
no
intention
of
saying
such
things
it
means
i
am
rather
overstrung
i
suppose
but
it
s
all
true
he
rose
and
began
to
run
his
eye
along
the
shelves
nearest
to
him
well
now
i
will
go
miss
marian
stood
up
as
he
approached
it
s
all
very
well
he
said
smiling
for
me
to
encourage
my
sisters
in
the
hope
that
they
may
earn
a
living
but
suppose
i
can
t
even
do
it
myself
it
s
by
no
means
certain
that
i
shall
make
ends
meet
this
you
have
every
reason
to
hope
i
i
like
to
hear
people
say
that
but
it
ll
mean
savage
work
when
we
were
all
at
finden
last
year
i
told
the
girls
that
it
would
be
another
twelve
months
before
i
could
support
myself
now
i
am
forced
to
do
it
and
i
don
t
like
work
my
nature
is
lazy
i
shall
never
write
for
writing
s
sake
only
to
make
money
all
my
plans
and
efforts
will
have
money
in
view
all
i
shan
t
allow
anything
to
come
in
the
way
of
my
material
i
wish
you
every
success
said
marian
without
looking
at
him
and
without
a
smile
thank
you
but
that
sounds
too
much
like
i
trust
we
are
to
be
friends
for
all
that
indeed
i
hope
we
may
they
shook
hands
and
he
went
towards
the
door
but
before
opening
it
he
asked
did
you
read
that
thing
of
mine
in
the
current
yes
i
it
wasn
t
bad
i
think
it
seemed
to
me
very
clever
yes
that
s
the
word
it
had
a
success
too
i
have
as
good
a
thing
half
done
for
the
april
number
but
i
ve
felt
too
to
go
on
with
it
the
girls
shall
let
you
know
when
they
are
in
marian
followed
him
into
the
passage
and
watched
him
as
he
opened
the
front
door
when
it
had
closed
she
went
back
into
the
study
for
a
few
minutes
before
rejoining
her
mother
chapter
ix
invita
minerva
after
all
there
came
a
day
when
edwin
reardon
found
himself
regularly
at
work
once
more
ticking
off
his
stipulated
quantum
of
manuscript
each
hours
he
wrote
a
very
small
hand
sixty
written
slips
of
the
kind
of
paper
he
habitually
used
would
represent
thanks
to
the
astonishing
system
which
prevails
in
such
matters
large
type
wide
spacing
frequency
of
blank
pages
a
passable
volume
on
an
average
he
could
write
four
such
slips
a
day
so
here
we
have
fifteen
days
for
the
volume
and
for
the
completed
book
days
an
eternity
in
the
looking
forward
yet
the
calculation
gave
him
a
encouragement
at
that
rate
he
might
have
his
book
sold
by
christmas
it
would
certainly
not
bring
him
a
hundred
pounds
perhaps
but
even
that
small
sum
would
enable
him
to
pay
the
quarter
s
rent
and
then
give
him
a
short
time
if
only
two
or
three
weeks
of
mental
rest
if
such
rest
could
not
be
obtained
all
was
at
an
end
with
him
he
must
either
find
some
new
means
of
supporting
himself
and
his
family
or
have
done
with
life
and
its
responsibilities
altogether
the
latter
alternative
was
often
enough
before
him
he
seldom
slept
for
more
than
two
or
three
consecutive
hours
in
the
night
and
the
time
of
wakefulness
was
often
terrible
the
various
sounds
which
marked
the
stages
from
midnight
to
dawn
had
grown
miserably
familiar
to
him
worst
torture
to
his
mind
was
the
chiming
and
striking
of
clocks
two
of
these
were
in
general
audible
that
of
marylebone
parish
church
and
that
of
the
adjoining
workhouse
the
latter
always
sounded
several
minutes
after
its
ecclesiastical
neighbour
and
with
a
difference
of
note
which
seemed
to
reardon
very
appropriate
a
thin
querulous
voice
reminding
one
of
the
community
it
represented
after
lying
awake
for
awhile
he
would
hear
quarters
sounding
if
they
ceased
before
the
fourth
he
was
glad
for
he
feared
to
know
what
time
it
was
if
the
hour
was
complete
he
waited
anxiously
for
its
number
two
three
even
four
were
grateful
there
was
still
a
long
time
before
he
need
rise
and
face
the
dreaded
task
the
horrible
four
blank
slips
of
paper
that
had
to
be
filled
ere
he
might
sleep
again
but
such
restfulness
was
only
for
a
moment
no
sooner
had
the
workhouse
bell
become
silent
than
he
began
to
toil
in
his
weary
imagination
or
else
incapable
of
that
to
vision
fearful
hazards
of
the
future
the
soft
breathing
of
amy
at
his
side
the
contact
of
her
warm
limbs
often
filled
him
with
intolerable
dread
even
now
he
did
not
believe
that
amy
loved
him
with
the
old
love
and
the
suspicion
was
like
a
cold
weight
at
his
heart
that
to
retain
even
her
wifely
sympathy
her
wedded
tenderness
he
must
achieve
the
impossible
the
impossible
for
he
could
no
longer
deceive
himself
with
a
hope
of
genuine
success
if
he
earned
a
bare
living
that
would
be
the
utmost
and
with
bare
livelihood
amy
would
not
could
not
be
content
if
he
were
to
die
a
natural
death
it
would
be
well
for
all
his
wife
and
the
child
would
be
looked
after
they
could
live
with
mrs
edmund
yule
and
certainly
it
would
not
be
long
before
amy
married
again
this
time
a
man
of
whose
competency
to
maintain
her
there
would
be
no
doubt
his
own
behaviour
had
been
cowardly
selfishness
oh
yes
she
had
loved
him
had
been
eager
to
believe
in
him
but
there
was
always
that
voice
of
warning
in
his
mind
he
foresaw
he
knew
and
if
he
killed
himself
not
here
no
lurid
horrors
for
that
poor
girl
and
her
relatives
but
somewhere
at
a
distance
under
circumstances
which
would
render
the
recovery
of
his
body
difficult
yet
would
leave
no
doubt
of
his
death
would
that
again
be
cowardly
the
opposite
when
once
it
was
certain
that
to
live
meant
poverty
and
wretchedness
amy
s
grief
however
sincere
would
be
but
a
short
trial
compared
with
what
else
might
lie
before
her
the
burden
of
supporting
her
and
willie
would
be
a
very
slight
one
if
she
went
to
live
in
her
mother
s
house
he
considered
the
whole
matter
night
after
night
until
perchance
it
happened
that
sleep
had
pity
upon
him
for
an
hour
before
the
time
of
rising
autumn
was
passing
into
winter
dark
days
which
were
always
an
oppression
to
his
mind
began
to
be
frequent
and
would
soon
succeed
each
other
remorselessly
well
if
only
each
of
them
represented
four
written
slips
milvain
s
advice
to
him
had
of
course
proved
useless
the
sensational
title
suggested
nothing
or
only
ragged
shapes
of
incomplete
humanity
that
fluttered
mockingly
when
he
strove
to
fix
them
but
he
had
decided
upon
a
story
of
the
kind
natural
to
him
a
thin
story
and
one
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
spin
into
three
volumes
his
own
at
all
events
the
title
was
always
a
matter
for
when
the
book
was
finished
he
had
never
yet
chosen
it
before
beginning
for
a
week
he
got
on
at
the
desired
rate
then
came
once
more
the
crisis
he
had
anticipated
a
familiar
symptom
of
the
malady
which
falls
upon
outwearied
imagination
there
were
floating
in
his
mind
five
or
six
possible
subjects
for
a
book
all
dating
back
to
the
time
when
he
first
began
when
ideas
came
freshly
to
him
if
he
grasped
desperately
at
one
of
these
and
did
his
best
to
develop
it
for
a
day
or
two
he
could
almost
content
himself
characters
situations
lines
of
motive
were
laboriously
schemed
and
he
felt
ready
to
begin
writing
but
scarcely
had
he
done
a
chapter
or
two
when
all
the
structure
fell
into
flatness
he
had
made
a
mistake
not
this
story
but
that
other
one
was
what
he
should
have
taken
the
other
one
in
question
left
out
of
mind
for
a
time
had
come
back
with
a
face
of
new
possibility
it
invited
him
tempted
him
to
throw
aside
what
he
had
already
written
good
now
he
was
in
more
hopeful
train
but
a
few
days
and
the
experience
repeated
itself
no
not
this
story
but
that
third
one
of
which
he
had
not
thought
for
a
long
time
how
could
he
have
rejected
so
hopeful
a
subject
for
months
he
had
been
living
in
this
way
endless
circling
perpetual
beginning
followed
by
frustration
a
sign
of
exhaustion
it
of
course
made
exhaustion
more
complete
at
times
he
was
on
the
of
imbecility
his
mind
looked
into
a
cloudy
chaos
a
shapeless
whirl
of
nothings
he
talked
aloud
to
himself
not
knowing
that
he
did
so
little
phrases
which
indicated
dolorously
the
subject
of
his
preoccupation
often
escaped
him
in
the
street
what
could
i
make
of
that
now
well
suppose
i
made
him
but
no
that
wouldn
t
do
and
so
on
it
had
happened
that
he
caught
the
eye
of
some
one
passing
fixed
in
surprise
upon
him
so
young
a
man
to
be
talking
to
himself
in
evident
distress
the
expected
crisis
came
even
now
that
he
was
savagely
determined
to
go
on
at
any
cost
to
write
let
the
result
be
what
it
would
his
will
prevailed
a
day
or
two
of
anguish
such
as
there
is
no
describing
to
the
inexperienced
and
again
he
was
dismissing
slip
after
slip
a
sigh
of
thankfulness
at
the
completion
of
each
one
it
was
a
fraction
of
the
whole
a
fraction
a
fraction
the
ordering
of
his
day
was
thus
at
nine
after
breakfast
he
sat
down
to
his
desk
and
worked
till
one
then
came
dinner
followed
by
a
walk
as
a
rule
he
could
not
allow
amy
to
walk
with
him
for
he
had
to
think
over
the
remainder
of
the
day
s
toil
and
companionship
would
have
been
fatal
at
about
three
he
again
seated
himself
and
wrote
until
six
when
he
had
a
meal
then
once
more
to
work
from
seven
to
ten
numberless
were
the
experiments
he
had
tried
for
the
day
s
division
the
slightest
interruption
of
the
order
for
the
time
being
put
him
out
of
gear
amy
durst
not
open
his
door
to
ask
however
necessary
a
question
sometimes
the
three
hours
labour
of
a
morning
resulted
in
lines
corrected
into
illegibility
his
brain
would
not
work
he
could
not
recall
the
simplest
synonyms
intolerable
faults
of
composition
drove
him
mad
he
would
write
a
sentence
beginning
thus
she
took
a
book
with
a
look
of
or
thus
a
revision
of
this
decision
would
have
made
him
an
object
of
or
if
the
period
were
otherwise
inoffensive
it
ran
in
a
rhythmic
gallop
which
was
torment
to
the
ear
all
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
his
former
books
had
been
noticeably
good
in
style
he
had
an
appreciation
of
shapely
prose
which
made
him
scorn
himself
for
the
kind
of
stuff
he
was
now
turning
out
i
can
t
help
it
it
must
go
the
time
is
things
were
better
as
a
rule
in
the
evening
occasionally
he
wrote
a
page
with
fluency
which
recalled
his
fortunate
years
and
then
his
heart
gladdened
his
hand
trembled
with
joy
description
of
locality
deliberate
analysis
of
character
or
motive
demanded
far
too
great
an
effort
for
his
present
condition
he
kept
as
much
as
possible
to
dialogue
the
space
is
filled
so
much
more
quickly
and
at
a
pinch
one
can
make
people
talk
about
the
paltriest
incidents
of
life
there
came
an
evening
when
he
opened
the
door
and
called
to
amy
what
is
it
she
answered
from
the
bedroom
i
m
busy
with
come
as
soon
as
you
are
in
ten
minutes
she
appeared
there
was
apprehension
on
her
face
she
feared
he
was
going
to
lament
his
inability
to
work
instead
of
that
he
told
her
joyfully
that
the
first
volume
was
finished
thank
goodness
she
exclaimed
are
you
going
to
do
any
more
i
think
not
if
you
will
come
and
sit
with
willie
doesn
t
seem
very
well
he
can
t
get
to
you
would
like
to
stay
with
him
a
little
while
i
ll
come
she
closed
the
door
reardon
brought
a
chair
to
the
fireside
and
allowed
himself
to
forget
the
two
volumes
that
had
still
to
be
struggled
through
in
a
grateful
sense
of
the
portion
that
was
achieved
in
a
few
minutes
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
would
be
delightful
to
read
a
scrap
of
the
odyssey
he
went
to
the
shelves
on
which
were
his
classical
books
took
the
desired
volume
and
opened
it
where
odysseus
speaks
to
nausicaa
for
never
yet
did
i
behold
one
of
mortals
like
to
thee
neither
man
nor
woman
i
am
awed
as
i
look
upon
thee
in
delos
once
hard
by
the
altar
of
apollo
i
saw
a
young
shooting
up
with
even
such
a
yes
yes
that
was
not
written
at
so
many
pages
a
day
with
a
workhouse
clock
clanging
its
admonition
at
the
poet
s
ear
how
it
freshened
the
soul
how
the
eyes
grew
dim
with
a
rare
joy
in
the
sounding
of
those
nobly
sweet
hexameters
amy
came
into
the
room
again
listen
said
reardon
looking
up
at
her
with
a
bright
smile
do
you
remember
the
first
time
that
i
read
you
this
and
he
turned
the
speech
into
free
prose
amy
laughed
i
remember
it
well
enough
we
were
alone
in
the
i
had
told
the
others
that
they
must
make
shift
with
the
for
that
evening
and
you
pulled
the
book
out
of
your
pocket
unexpectedly
i
laughed
at
your
habit
of
always
carrying
little
books
the
cheerful
news
had
brightened
her
if
she
had
been
summoned
to
hear
lamentations
her
voice
would
not
have
rippled
thus
soothingly
reardon
thought
of
this
and
it
made
him
silent
for
a
minute
the
habit
was
ominous
he
said
looking
at
her
with
an
uncertain
smile
a
practical
literary
man
doesn
t
do
such
milvain
for
instance
with
curious
frequency
she
mentioned
the
name
of
milvain
her
unconsciousness
in
doing
so
prevented
reardon
from
thinking
about
the
fact
still
he
had
noted
it
did
you
understand
the
phrase
slightingly
he
asked
slightingly
yes
a
little
of
course
it
always
has
that
sense
on
your
lips
i
in
the
light
of
this
answer
he
mused
upon
her
instance
true
he
had
occasionally
spoken
of
jasper
with
something
less
than
respect
but
amy
was
not
in
the
habit
of
doing
so
i
hadn
t
any
such
meaning
just
then
he
said
i
meant
quite
simply
that
my
bookish
habits
didn
t
promise
much
for
my
success
as
a
i
see
but
you
didn
t
think
of
it
in
that
way
at
the
he
sighed
no
at
least
at
least
what
well
no
on
the
whole
i
had
good
amy
twisted
her
fingers
together
impatiently
edwin
let
me
tell
you
something
you
are
getting
too
fond
of
speaking
in
a
discouraging
way
now
why
should
you
do
so
i
don
t
like
it
it
has
one
disagreeable
effect
on
me
and
that
is
when
people
ask
me
about
you
how
you
are
getting
on
i
don
t
quite
know
how
to
answer
they
can
t
help
seeing
that
i
am
uneasy
i
speak
so
differently
from
what
i
used
do
you
really
indeed
i
can
t
help
it
as
i
say
it
s
very
much
your
own
well
but
granted
that
i
am
not
of
a
very
sanguine
nature
and
that
i
easily
fall
into
gloomy
ways
of
talk
what
is
amy
here
for
yes
yes
but
but
i
am
not
here
only
to
try
and
keep
you
in
good
spirits
am
i
she
asked
it
prettily
with
a
smile
like
that
of
maidenhood
heaven
forbid
i
oughtn
t
to
have
put
it
in
that
absolute
way
i
was
half
joking
you
know
but
unfortunately
it
s
true
that
i
can
t
be
as
as
i
could
wish
does
that
make
you
impatient
with
me
a
little
i
can
t
help
the
feeling
and
i
ought
to
try
to
overcome
it
but
you
must
try
on
your
side
as
well
why
should
you
have
said
that
thing
just
now
you
re
quite
right
it
was
a
few
weeks
ago
i
didn
t
expect
you
to
be
cheerful
things
began
to
look
about
as
bad
as
they
could
but
now
that
you
ve
got
a
volume
finished
there
s
hope
once
hope
of
what
quality
reardon
durst
not
say
what
rose
in
his
thoughts
a
very
small
poor
hope
hope
of
money
enough
to
struggle
through
another
half
year
if
indeed
enough
for
he
had
learnt
that
amy
was
not
to
be
told
the
whole
truth
about
anything
as
he
himself
saw
it
it
was
a
pity
to
the
ideal
wife
a
man
speaks
out
all
that
is
in
him
she
had
infinitely
rather
share
his
full
conviction
than
be
treated
as
one
from
whom
facts
must
be
disguised
she
says
let
us
face
the
worst
and
talk
of
it
together
you
and
no
amy
was
not
the
ideal
wife
from
that
point
of
view
but
the
moment
after
this
had
traversed
his
consciousness
he
condemned
himself
and
looked
with
the
joy
of
love
into
her
clear
eyes
yes
there
s
hope
once
more
my
dearest
no
more
gloomy
talk
i
have
read
you
something
now
you
shall
read
something
to
me
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
delighted
myself
with
listening
to
you
what
shall
it
be
i
feel
rather
too
tired
do
you
i
have
had
to
look
after
willie
so
much
but
read
me
some
more
homer
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
reardon
reached
for
the
book
again
but
not
readily
his
face
showed
disappointment
their
evenings
together
had
never
been
the
same
since
the
birth
of
the
child
willie
was
always
an
excuse
valid
enough
for
amy
s
feeling
tired
the
little
boy
had
come
between
him
and
the
mother
as
must
always
be
the
case
in
poor
homes
most
of
all
where
the
poverty
is
relative
reardon
could
not
pass
the
subject
without
a
remark
but
he
tried
to
speak
humorously
there
ought
to
be
a
huge
public
creche
in
london
it
s
monstrous
that
an
educated
mother
should
have
to
be
but
you
know
very
well
i
think
nothing
of
that
a
creche
indeed
no
child
of
mine
should
go
to
any
such
there
it
was
she
grudged
no
trouble
on
behalf
of
the
child
that
was
love
whereas
but
then
maternal
love
was
a
mere
matter
of
course
as
soon
as
you
get
two
or
three
hundred
pounds
for
a
book
she
added
laughing
there
ll
be
no
need
for
me
to
give
so
much
two
or
three
hundred
pounds
he
repeated
it
with
a
shake
of
the
head
ah
if
that
were
possible
but
that
s
really
a
paltry
sum
what
would
fifty
novelists
you
could
name
say
if
they
were
offered
three
hundred
pounds
for
a
book
how
much
do
you
suppose
even
markland
got
for
his
last
didn
t
sell
it
at
all
ten
to
one
gets
a
which
will
bring
him
five
or
six
hundred
pounds
before
the
book
ceases
to
be
talked
never
mind
i
m
sick
of
the
word
so
am
she
sighed
commenting
thus
on
her
acquiescence
but
look
amy
if
i
try
to
be
cheerful
in
spite
of
natural
dumps
wouldn
t
it
be
fair
for
you
to
put
aside
thoughts
of
money
yes
read
some
homer
dear
let
us
have
odysseus
down
in
hades
and
ajax
stalking
past
him
oh
i
like
that
so
he
read
rather
coldly
at
first
but
soon
warming
amy
sat
with
folded
arms
a
smile
on
her
lips
her
brows
knitted
to
the
epic
humour
in
a
few
minutes
it
was
as
if
no
difficulties
threatened
their
life
every
now
and
then
reardon
looked
up
from
his
translating
with
a
delighted
laugh
in
which
amy
joined
when
he
had
returned
the
book
to
the
shelf
he
stepped
behind
his
wife
s
chair
leaned
upon
it
and
put
his
cheek
against
hers
amy
yes
dear
do
you
still
love
me
a
little
much
more
than
a
though
i
am
sunk
to
writing
a
wretched
is
it
so
bad
as
all
that
confoundedly
bad
i
shall
be
ashamed
to
see
it
in
print
the
proofs
will
be
a
oh
but
why
why
it
s
the
best
i
can
do
dearest
so
you
don
t
love
me
enough
to
hear
that
if
i
didn
t
love
you
i
might
be
calmer
about
it
edwin
it
s
dreadful
to
me
to
think
of
what
they
will
say
in
the
curse
the
reviews
his
mood
had
changed
on
the
instant
he
stood
up
with
darkened
face
trembling
angrily
i
want
you
to
promise
me
something
amy
you
won
t
read
a
single
one
of
the
notices
unless
it
is
forced
upon
your
attention
now
promise
me
that
neglect
them
absolutely
as
i
do
they
re
not
worth
a
glance
of
your
eyes
and
i
shan
t
be
able
to
bear
it
if
i
know
you
read
all
the
contempt
that
will
be
poured
on
i
m
sure
i
shall
be
glad
enough
to
avoid
it
but
other
people
our
friends
read
it
that
s
the
you
know
that
their
praise
would
be
valueless
so
have
strength
to
disregard
the
blame
let
our
friends
read
and
talk
as
much
as
they
like
can
t
you
console
yourself
with
the
thought
that
i
am
not
contemptible
though
i
may
have
been
forced
to
do
poor
work
people
don
t
look
at
it
in
that
but
darling
he
took
her
hands
strongly
in
his
own
i
want
you
to
disregard
other
people
you
and
i
are
surely
everything
to
each
other
are
you
ashamed
of
me
of
me
myself
no
not
ashamed
of
you
but
i
am
sensitive
to
people
s
talk
and
but
that
means
they
make
you
feel
ashamed
of
me
what
else
there
was
silence
edwin
if
you
find
you
are
unable
to
do
good
work
you
mustn
t
do
bad
we
must
think
of
some
other
way
of
making
a
have
you
forgotten
that
you
urged
me
to
write
a
trashy
sensational
story
she
coloured
and
looked
annoyed
you
misunderstood
me
a
sensational
story
needn
t
be
trash
and
then
you
know
if
you
had
tried
something
entirely
unlike
your
usual
work
that
would
have
been
excuse
enough
if
people
had
called
it
a
people
people
we
can
t
live
in
solitude
edwin
though
really
we
are
not
far
from
he
did
not
dare
to
make
any
reply
to
this
amy
was
so
exasperatingly
womanlike
in
avoiding
the
important
issue
to
which
he
tried
to
confine
her
another
moment
and
his
tone
would
be
that
of
irritation
so
he
turned
away
and
sat
down
to
his
desk
as
if
he
had
some
thought
of
resuming
work
will
you
come
and
have
some
supper
amy
asked
rising
i
have
been
forgetting
that
morning
s
chapter
has
still
to
be
thought
edwin
i
can
t
think
this
book
will
really
be
so
poor
you
couldn
t
possibly
give
all
this
toil
for
no
no
not
if
i
were
in
sound
health
but
i
am
far
from
come
and
have
supper
with
me
dear
and
think
he
turned
and
smiled
at
her
i
hope
i
shall
never
be
able
to
resist
an
invitation
from
you
the
result
of
all
this
was
of
course
that
he
sat
down
in
anything
but
the
right
mood
to
his
work
next
morning
amy
s
anticipation
of
criticism
had
made
it
harder
than
ever
for
him
to
labour
at
what
he
knew
to
be
bad
and
as
would
have
it
in
a
day
or
two
he
caught
his
first
winter
s
cold
for
several
years
a
succession
of
influenzas
lumbagoes
had
tormented
him
from
october
to
may
in
planning
his
present
work
and
telling
himself
that
it
must
be
finished
before
christmas
he
had
not
lost
sight
of
these
possible
interruptions
but
he
said
to
himself
other
men
have
worked
hard
in
seasons
of
illness
i
must
do
the
all
very
well
but
reardon
did
not
belong
to
the
heroic
class
a
feverish
cold
now
put
his
powers
and
resolution
to
the
test
through
one
hideous
day
he
nailed
himself
to
the
desk
and
wrote
a
quarter
of
a
page
the
next
day
amy
would
not
let
him
rise
from
bed
he
was
wretchedly
ill
in
the
night
he
had
talked
about
his
work
deliriously
causing
her
no
slight
alarm
if
this
goes
on
she
said
to
him
in
the
morning
you
ll
have
brain
fever
you
must
rest
for
two
or
three
teach
me
how
to
i
wish
i
rest
had
indeed
become
out
of
the
question
for
two
days
he
could
not
write
but
the
result
upon
his
mind
was
far
worse
than
if
he
had
been
at
the
desk
he
looked
a
haggard
creature
when
he
again
sat
down
with
the
accustomed
blank
slip
before
him
the
second
volume
ought
to
have
been
much
easier
work
than
the
first
it
proved
far
harder
messieurs
and
mesdames
the
critics
are
wont
to
point
out
the
weakness
of
second
volumes
they
are
generally
right
simply
because
a
story
which
would
have
made
a
tolerable
book
the
common
run
of
stories
refuses
to
fill
three
books
reardon
s
story
was
in
itself
weak
and
this
second
volume
had
to
consist
almost
entirely
of
laborious
padding
if
he
wrote
three
slips
a
day
he
did
well
and
the
money
was
melting
melting
despite
amy
s
efforts
at
economy
she
spent
as
little
as
she
could
not
a
luxury
came
into
their
home
articles
of
clothing
all
but
indispensable
were
left
unpurchased
but
to
what
purpose
was
all
this
impossible
now
that
the
book
should
be
finished
and
sold
before
the
money
had
all
run
out
at
the
end
of
november
reardon
said
to
his
wife
one
morning
i
finish
the
second
and
in
a
week
she
replied
we
shan
t
have
a
shilling
he
had
refrained
from
making
inquiries
and
amy
had
forborne
to
tell
him
the
state
of
things
lest
it
should
bring
him
to
a
dead
stop
in
his
writing
but
now
they
must
needs
discuss
their
position
in
three
weeks
i
can
get
to
the
end
said
reardon
with
unnatural
calmness
then
i
will
go
personally
to
the
publishers
and
beg
them
to
advance
me
something
on
the
manuscript
before
they
have
read
couldn
t
you
do
that
with
the
first
two
volumes
no
i
can
t
indeed
i
can
t
the
other
thing
will
be
bad
enough
but
to
beg
on
an
incomplete
book
and
such
a
book
i
can
t
there
were
drops
on
his
forehead
they
would
help
you
if
they
knew
said
amy
in
a
low
voice
perhaps
i
can
t
say
they
can
t
help
every
poor
devil
no
i
will
sell
some
books
i
can
pick
out
fifty
or
sixty
that
i
shan
t
much
amy
knew
what
a
wrench
this
would
be
the
imminence
of
distress
seemed
to
have
softened
her
edwin
let
me
take
those
two
volumes
to
the
publishers
and
ask
heavens
no
that
s
impossible
ten
to
one
you
will
be
told
that
my
work
is
of
such
doubtful
value
that
they
can
t
offer
even
a
guinea
till
the
whole
book
has
been
considered
i
can
t
allow
you
to
go
dearest
this
morning
i
ll
choose
some
books
that
i
can
spare
and
after
dinner
i
ll
ask
a
man
to
come
and
look
at
them
don
t
worry
yourself
i
can
finish
in
three
weeks
i
m
sure
i
can
if
i
can
get
you
three
or
four
pounds
you
could
make
it
do
couldn
t
you
she
averted
her
face
as
she
spoke
you
shall
have
he
still
spoke
very
quietly
if
the
books
won
t
bring
enough
there
s
my
watch
oh
lots
of
he
turned
abruptly
away
and
amy
went
on
with
her
household
work
chapter
x
the
friends
of
the
family
it
was
natural
that
amy
should
hint
dissatisfaction
with
the
loneliness
in
which
her
days
were
mostly
spent
she
had
never
lived
in
a
large
circle
of
acquaintances
the
narrowness
of
her
mother
s
means
restricted
the
family
to
intercourse
with
a
few
old
friends
and
such
new
ones
as
were
content
with
teacup
entertainment
but
her
tastes
were
social
and
the
maturing
process
which
followed
upon
her
marriage
made
her
more
conscious
of
this
than
she
had
been
before
already
she
had
allowed
her
husband
to
understand
that
one
of
her
strongest
motives
in
marrying
him
was
the
belief
that
he
would
achieve
distinction
at
the
time
she
doubtless
thought
of
his
coming
fame
only
or
principally
as
it
concerned
their
relations
to
each
other
her
pride
in
him
was
to
be
one
phase
of
her
love
now
she
was
well
aware
that
no
degree
of
distinction
in
her
husband
would
be
of
much
value
to
her
unless
she
had
the
pleasure
of
witnessing
its
effect
upon
others
she
must
shine
with
reflected
light
before
an
admiring
assembly
the
more
conscious
she
became
of
this
requirement
of
her
nature
the
more
clearly
did
she
perceive
that
her
hopes
had
been
founded
on
an
error
reardon
would
never
be
a
great
man
he
would
never
even
occupy
a
prominent
place
in
the
estimation
of
the
public
the
two
things
amy
knew
might
be
as
different
as
light
and
darkness
but
in
the
grief
of
her
disappointment
she
would
rather
have
had
him
flare
into
a
worthless
popularity
than
flicker
down
into
total
extinction
which
it
almost
seemed
was
to
be
his
fate
she
knew
so
well
how
people
were
talking
of
him
and
her
even
her
unliterary
acquaintances
understood
that
reardon
s
last
novel
had
been
anything
but
successful
and
they
must
of
course
ask
each
other
how
the
reardons
were
going
to
live
if
the
business
of
proved
unremunerative
her
pride
took
offence
at
the
mere
thought
of
such
conversations
presently
she
would
become
an
object
of
pity
there
would
be
talk
of
poor
mrs
it
was
intolerable
so
during
the
last
half
year
she
had
withheld
as
much
as
possible
from
the
intercourse
which
might
have
been
one
of
her
chief
pleasures
and
to
disguise
the
true
cause
she
made
pretences
which
were
a
satire
upon
her
state
of
mind
alleging
that
she
had
devoted
herself
to
a
serious
course
of
studies
that
the
care
of
house
and
child
occupied
all
the
time
she
could
spare
from
her
intellectual
pursuits
the
worst
of
it
was
she
had
little
faith
in
the
efficacy
of
these
fictions
in
uttering
them
she
felt
an
unpleasant
warmth
upon
her
cheeks
and
it
was
not
difficult
to
detect
a
look
of
doubt
in
the
eyes
of
the
listener
she
grew
angry
with
herself
for
being
dishonest
and
with
her
husband
for
making
such
dishonesty
needful
the
female
friend
with
whom
she
had
most
trouble
was
mrs
carter
you
remember
that
on
the
occasion
of
reardon
s
first
meeting
with
his
future
wife
at
the
grosvenor
gallery
there
were
present
his
friend
carter
and
a
young
lady
who
was
shortly
to
bear
the
name
of
that
spirited
young
man
the
carters
had
now
been
married
about
a
year
they
lived
in
bayswater
and
saw
much
of
a
certain
world
which
imitates
on
a
lower
plane
the
amusements
and
affectations
of
society
proper
mr
carter
was
still
secretary
to
the
hospital
where
reardon
had
once
earned
his
twenty
shillings
a
week
but
by
voyaging
in
the
seas
of
charitable
enterprise
he
had
come
upon
supplementary
sources
of
income
for
instance
he
held
the
post
of
secretary
to
the
barclay
trust
a
charity
whose
moderate
funds
were
largely
devoted
to
the
support
of
gentlemen
engaged
in
administering
it
this
young
man
with
his
air
of
pleasing
vivacity
had
early
ingratiated
himself
with
the
kind
of
people
who
were
likely
to
be
of
use
to
him
he
had
his
reward
in
the
shape
of
offices
which
are
only
procured
through
private
influence
his
wife
was
a
lively
and
rather
clever
girl
she
had
a
genuine
regard
for
amy
and
much
respect
for
reardon
her
ambition
was
to
form
a
circle
of
distinctly
intellectual
acquaintances
and
she
was
constantly
inviting
the
reardons
to
her
house
a
real
live
novelist
is
not
easily
drawn
into
the
world
where
mrs
carter
had
her
being
and
it
annoyed
her
that
all
attempts
to
secure
amy
and
her
husband
for
clock
teas
and
small
parties
had
of
late
failed
on
the
afternoon
when
reardon
had
visited
a
bookseller
with
a
view
of
raising
money
he
was
again
shut
up
in
his
study
dolorously
at
work
amy
was
disturbed
by
the
sound
of
a
visitor
s
the
little
servant
went
to
the
door
and
returned
followed
by
mrs
carter
under
the
best
of
circumstances
it
was
awkward
to
receive
any
but
intimate
friends
during
the
hours
when
reardon
sat
at
his
desk
the
little
with
its
screen
to
conceal
the
kitchen
range
offered
nothing
more
than
homely
comfort
and
then
the
servant
had
to
be
disposed
of
by
sending
her
into
the
bedroom
to
take
care
of
willie
privacy
in
the
strict
sense
was
impossible
for
the
servant
might
listen
at
the
door
one
room
led
out
of
the
other
to
all
the
conversation
that
went
on
yet
amy
could
not
request
her
visitors
to
speak
in
a
low
tone
for
the
first
year
these
difficulties
had
not
been
felt
reardon
made
a
point
of
leaving
the
front
room
at
his
wife
s
disposal
from
three
to
six
it
was
only
when
dread
of
the
future
began
to
press
upon
him
that
he
sat
in
the
study
all
day
long
you
see
how
complicated
were
the
miseries
of
the
situation
one
torment
involved
another
and
in
every
quarter
subjects
of
discontent
were
multiplied
mrs
carter
would
have
taken
it
ill
had
she
known
that
amy
did
not
regard
her
as
strictly
an
intimate
they
addressed
each
other
by
their
christian
names
and
conversed
without
ceremony
but
amy
was
always
dissatisfied
when
the
young
woman
burst
with
laughter
and
animated
talk
into
this
abode
of
concealed
poverty
edith
was
not
the
kind
of
person
with
whom
one
can
quarrel
she
had
a
kind
heart
and
was
never
disagreeably
pretentious
had
circumstances
allowed
it
amy
would
have
given
frank
welcome
to
such
friendship
she
would
have
been
glad
to
accept
as
many
invitations
as
edith
chose
to
offer
but
at
present
it
did
her
harm
to
come
in
contact
with
mrs
carter
it
made
her
envious
cold
to
her
husband
resentful
against
fate
why
can
t
she
leave
me
alone
was
the
thought
that
rose
in
her
mind
as
edith
entered
i
shall
let
her
see
that
i
don
t
want
her
your
husband
at
work
edith
asked
with
a
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
study
as
soon
as
they
had
exchanged
kisses
and
greetings
yes
he
is
and
you
are
sitting
alone
as
usual
i
feared
you
might
be
out
an
afternoon
of
sunshine
isn
t
to
be
neglected
at
this
time
of
is
there
sunshine
amy
inquired
coldly
why
look
do
you
mean
to
say
you
haven
t
noticed
it
what
a
comical
person
you
are
sometimes
i
suppose
you
have
been
over
head
and
ears
in
books
all
day
how
is
willie
very
well
thank
mayn
t
i
see
him
if
you
amy
stepped
to
the
bedroom
door
and
bade
the
servant
bring
willie
for
exhibition
edith
who
as
yet
had
no
child
of
her
own
always
showed
the
most
flattering
admiration
of
this
infant
it
was
so
manifestly
sincere
that
the
mother
could
not
but
be
moved
to
a
grateful
friendliness
whenever
she
listened
to
its
expression
even
this
afternoon
the
usual
effect
followed
when
edith
had
made
a
pretty
and
tender
fool
of
herself
for
several
minutes
amy
bade
the
servant
make
tea
at
this
moment
the
door
from
the
passage
opened
and
reardon
looked
in
well
if
this
isn
t
marvellous
cried
edith
i
should
as
soon
have
expected
the
heavens
to
fall
as
what
asked
reardon
with
a
pale
smile
as
you
to
show
yourself
when
i
am
i
should
like
to
say
that
i
came
on
purpose
to
see
you
mrs
carter
but
it
wouldn
t
be
true
i
m
going
out
for
an
hour
so
that
you
can
take
possession
of
the
other
room
if
you
like
going
out
said
amy
with
a
look
of
surprise
nothing
nothing
i
mustn
t
he
just
inquired
of
mrs
carter
how
her
husband
was
and
withdrew
the
door
of
the
flat
was
heard
to
close
after
him
let
us
go
into
the
study
then
said
amy
again
in
rather
a
cold
voice
on
reardon
s
desk
were
lying
slips
of
blank
paper
edith
approaching
on
tiptoe
with
what
was
partly
make
believe
partly
genuine
awe
looked
at
the
literary
apparatus
then
turned
with
a
laugh
to
her
friend
how
delightful
it
must
be
to
sit
down
and
write
about
people
one
has
invented
ever
since
i
have
known
you
and
mr
reardon
i
have
been
tempted
to
try
if
i
couldn
t
write
a
have
you
and
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
how
you
can
resist
the
temptation
i
feel
sure
you
could
write
books
almost
as
clever
as
your
husband
i
have
no
intention
of
you
don
t
seem
very
well
oh
i
think
i
am
as
well
as
she
guessed
that
her
husband
was
once
more
brought
to
a
standstill
and
this
darkened
her
humour
again
one
of
my
reasons
for
coming
said
edith
was
to
beg
and
entreat
and
implore
you
and
mr
reardon
to
dine
with
us
next
wednesday
now
don
t
put
on
such
a
severe
face
are
you
engaged
that
evening
yes
in
the
ordinary
way
edwin
can
t
possibly
leave
his
but
for
one
poor
evening
it
s
such
ages
since
we
saw
i
m
very
sorry
i
don
t
think
we
shall
ever
be
able
to
accept
invitations
in
amy
spoke
thus
at
the
prompting
of
a
sudden
impulse
a
minute
ago
no
such
definite
declaration
was
in
her
mind
never
exclaimed
edith
but
why
whatever
do
you
mean
we
find
that
social
engagements
consume
too
much
time
amy
replied
her
explanation
just
as
much
of
an
impromptu
as
the
announcement
had
been
you
see
one
must
either
belong
to
society
or
not
married
people
can
t
accept
an
occasional
invitation
from
friends
and
never
do
their
social
duty
in
return
we
have
decided
to
withdraw
altogether
at
all
events
for
the
present
i
shall
see
no
one
except
my
edith
listened
with
a
face
of
astonishment
you
won
t
even
see
me
she
exclaimed
indeed
i
have
no
wish
to
lose
your
friendship
yet
i
am
ashamed
to
ask
you
to
come
here
when
i
can
never
return
your
oh
please
don
t
put
it
in
that
way
but
it
seems
so
very
edith
could
not
help
conjecturing
the
true
significance
of
this
resolve
but
as
is
commonly
the
case
with
people
in
easy
circumstances
she
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
her
friends
were
so
straitened
as
to
have
a
difficulty
in
supporting
the
ordinary
obligations
of
a
civilised
state
i
know
how
precious
your
husband
s
time
is
she
added
as
if
to
remove
the
effect
of
her
last
remark
surely
there
s
no
harm
in
my
saying
we
know
each
other
well
enough
you
wouldn
t
think
it
necessary
to
devote
an
evening
to
entertaining
us
just
because
you
had
given
us
the
pleasure
of
your
company
i
put
it
very
stupidly
but
i
m
sure
you
understand
me
amy
don
t
refuse
just
to
come
to
our
house
now
and
i
m
afraid
we
shall
have
to
be
consistent
but
do
you
think
this
is
a
wise
thing
to
do
wise
you
know
what
you
once
told
me
about
how
necessary
it
was
for
a
novelist
to
study
all
sorts
of
people
how
can
mr
reardon
do
this
if
he
shuts
himself
up
in
the
house
i
should
have
thought
he
would
find
it
necessary
to
make
new
as
i
said
returned
amy
it
won
t
be
always
like
this
for
the
present
edwin
has
quite
enough
she
spoke
distantly
it
irritated
her
to
have
to
invent
excuses
for
the
sacrifice
she
had
just
imposed
on
herself
edith
sipped
the
tea
which
had
been
offered
her
and
for
a
minute
kept
silence
when
will
mr
reardon
s
next
book
be
published
she
asked
at
length
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
not
before
the
i
shall
look
so
anxiously
for
it
whenever
i
meet
new
people
i
always
turn
the
conversation
to
novels
just
for
the
sake
of
asking
them
if
they
know
your
husband
s
she
laughed
merrily
which
is
seldom
the
case
i
should
think
said
amy
with
a
smile
of
indifference
well
my
dear
you
don
t
expect
ordinary
to
know
about
mr
reardon
i
wish
my
acquaintances
were
a
better
kind
of
people
then
of
course
i
should
hear
of
his
books
more
often
but
one
has
to
make
the
best
of
such
society
as
offers
if
you
and
your
husband
forsake
me
i
shall
feel
it
a
sad
loss
i
shall
amy
gave
a
quick
glance
at
the
speaker
s
face
oh
we
must
be
friends
just
the
same
she
said
more
naturally
than
she
had
spoken
hitherto
but
don
t
ask
us
to
come
and
dine
just
now
all
through
this
winter
we
shall
be
very
busy
both
of
us
indeed
we
have
decided
not
to
accept
any
invitations
at
then
so
long
as
you
let
me
come
here
now
and
then
i
must
give
in
i
promise
not
to
trouble
you
with
any
more
complaining
but
how
you
can
live
such
a
life
i
don
t
know
i
consider
myself
more
of
a
reader
than
women
generally
are
and
i
should
be
mortally
offended
if
anyone
called
me
frivolous
but
i
must
have
a
good
deal
of
society
really
and
truly
i
can
t
live
without
no
said
amy
with
a
smile
which
meant
more
than
edith
could
interpret
it
seemed
slightly
condescending
there
s
no
knowing
perhaps
if
i
had
married
a
literary
man
she
paused
smiling
and
musing
but
then
i
haven
t
you
she
laughed
albert
is
anything
but
a
bookworm
as
you
you
wouldn
t
wish
him
to
oh
no
not
a
bookworm
to
be
sure
we
suit
each
other
very
well
indeed
he
likes
society
just
as
much
as
i
do
it
would
be
the
death
of
him
if
he
didn
t
spend
of
every
day
with
lively
that
s
rather
a
large
portion
but
then
you
count
yourself
among
the
lively
they
exchanged
looks
and
laughed
together
of
course
you
think
me
rather
silly
to
want
to
talk
so
much
with
silly
people
edith
went
on
but
then
there
s
generally
some
amusement
to
be
got
you
know
i
don
t
take
life
quite
so
seriously
as
you
do
people
are
people
after
all
it
s
good
fun
to
see
how
they
live
and
hear
how
they
amy
felt
that
she
was
playing
a
sorry
part
she
thought
of
sour
grapes
and
of
the
fox
who
had
lost
his
tail
worst
of
all
perhaps
edith
suspected
the
truth
she
began
to
make
inquiries
about
common
acquaintances
and
fell
into
an
easier
current
of
gossip
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
visitor
s
departure
reardon
came
back
amy
had
guessed
aright
the
necessity
of
selling
his
books
weighed
upon
him
so
that
for
the
present
he
could
do
nothing
the
evening
was
spent
gloomily
with
very
little
conversation
next
day
came
the
bookseller
to
make
his
inspection
reardon
had
chosen
out
and
ranged
upon
a
table
nearly
a
hundred
volumes
with
a
few
exceptions
they
had
been
purchased
the
tradesman
examined
them
rapidly
what
do
you
ask
he
inquired
putting
his
head
aside
i
prefer
that
you
should
make
an
offer
reardon
replied
with
the
helplessness
of
one
who
lives
remote
from
traffic
i
can
t
say
more
than
two
pounds
that
is
at
the
rate
of
sixpence
a
volume
to
me
that
s
about
the
average
value
of
books
like
perhaps
the
offer
was
a
fair
one
perhaps
it
was
not
reardon
had
neither
time
nor
spirit
to
test
the
possibilities
of
the
market
he
was
ashamed
to
betray
his
need
by
higgling
i
ll
take
it
he
said
in
a
voice
a
messenger
was
sent
for
the
books
that
afternoon
he
stowed
them
skilfully
in
two
bags
and
carried
them
downstairs
to
a
cart
that
was
waiting
reardon
looked
at
the
gaps
left
on
his
shelves
many
of
those
vanished
volumes
were
dear
old
friends
to
him
he
could
have
told
you
where
he
had
picked
them
up
and
when
to
open
them
recalled
a
past
moment
of
intellectual
growth
a
mood
of
hope
or
despondency
a
stage
of
struggle
in
most
of
them
his
name
was
written
and
there
were
often
pencilled
notes
in
the
margin
of
course
he
had
chosen
from
among
the
most
valuable
he
possessed
such
a
multitude
must
else
have
been
sold
to
make
this
sum
of
two
pounds
ten
books
are
cheap
you
know
at
need
one
can
buy
a
homer
for
fourpence
a
sophocles
for
sixpence
it
was
not
rubbish
that
he
had
accumulated
at
so
small
expenditure
but
the
library
of
a
poor
student
battered
bindings
stained
pages
supplanted
editions
he
loved
his
books
but
there
was
something
he
loved
more
and
when
amy
glanced
at
him
with
eyes
of
sympathy
he
broke
into
a
cheerful
laugh
i
m
only
sorry
they
have
gone
for
so
little
tell
me
when
the
money
is
nearly
at
an
end
again
and
you
shall
have
more
it
s
all
right
the
novel
will
be
done
and
that
night
he
worked
until
twelve
o
clock
doggedly
fiercely
the
next
day
was
sunday
as
a
rule
he
made
it
a
day
of
rest
and
almost
perforce
for
the
depressing
influence
of
sunday
in
london
made
work
too
difficult
then
it
was
the
day
on
which
he
either
went
to
see
his
own
particular
friends
or
was
visited
by
them
do
you
expect
anyone
this
evening
amy
inquired
biffen
will
look
in
i
dare
say
perhaps
i
think
i
shall
take
willie
to
mother
s
i
shall
be
back
before
amy
don
t
say
anything
about
the
no
i
suppose
they
always
ask
you
when
we
think
of
removing
over
the
way
he
pointed
in
a
direction
that
suggested
marylebone
workhouse
amy
tried
to
laugh
but
a
woman
with
a
child
in
her
arms
has
no
keen
relish
for
such
jokes
i
don
t
talk
to
them
about
our
affairs
she
said
that
s
she
left
home
about
three
o
clock
the
servant
going
with
her
to
carry
the
child
at
five
a
familiar
knock
sounded
through
the
flat
it
was
a
heavy
rap
followed
by
light
ones
like
a
reverberating
echo
the
last
stroke
scarcely
audible
reardon
laid
down
his
book
but
kept
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
went
to
the
door
a
tall
thin
man
stood
there
with
a
slouch
hat
and
long
grey
overcoat
he
shook
hands
silently
hung
his
hat
in
the
passage
and
came
forward
into
the
study
his
name
was
harold
biffen
and
to
judge
from
his
appearance
he
did
not
belong
to
the
race
of
common
mortals
his
excessive
meagreness
would
all
but
have
qualified
him
to
enter
an
exhibition
in
the
capacity
of
living
skeleton
and
the
garments
which
hung
upon
this
framework
would
perhaps
have
sold
for
at
an
dealer
s
but
the
man
was
superior
to
these
accidents
of
flesh
and
raiment
he
had
a
fine
face
large
gentle
eyes
nose
slightly
aquiline
small
and
delicate
mouth
thick
black
hair
fell
to
his
he
wore
a
heavy
moustache
and
a
full
beard
in
his
gait
there
was
a
singular
dignity
only
a
man
of
cultivated
mind
and
graceful
character
could
move
and
stand
as
he
did
his
first
act
on
entering
the
room
was
to
take
from
his
pocket
a
pipe
a
pouch
a
little
and
a
box
of
matches
all
of
which
he
arranged
carefully
on
a
corner
of
the
central
table
then
he
drew
forward
a
chair
and
seated
himself
take
your
off
said
reardon
thanks
not
this
why
the
deuce
not
not
this
evening
the
reason
as
soon
as
reardon
sought
for
it
was
obvious
biffen
had
no
ordinary
coat
beneath
the
other
to
have
referred
to
this
fact
would
have
been
indelicate
the
novelist
of
course
understood
it
and
smiled
but
with
no
mirth
let
me
have
your
sophocles
were
the
visitor
s
next
words
reardon
offered
him
a
volume
of
the
oxford
pocket
classics
i
prefer
the
wunder
it
s
gone
my
gone
wanted
a
little
biffen
uttered
a
sound
in
which
remonstrance
and
sympathy
were
blended
i
m
sorry
to
hear
that
very
sorry
well
this
must
do
now
i
want
to
know
how
you
scan
this
chorus
in
the
oedipus
reardon
took
the
volume
considered
and
began
to
read
aloud
with
metric
emphasis
choriambics
eh
cried
the
other
possible
of
course
but
treat
them
as
ionics
a
minore
with
an
anacrusis
and
see
if
they
don
t
go
he
involved
himself
in
terms
of
pedantry
and
with
such
delight
that
his
eyes
gleamed
having
delivered
a
technical
lecture
he
began
to
read
in
illustration
producing
quite
a
different
effect
from
that
of
the
rhythm
as
given
by
his
friend
and
the
reading
was
by
no
means
that
of
a
pedant
rather
of
a
poet
for
half
an
hour
the
two
men
talked
greek
metres
as
if
they
lived
in
a
world
where
the
only
hunger
known
could
be
satisfied
by
grand
or
sweet
cadences
they
had
first
met
in
an
amusing
way
not
long
after
the
publication
of
his
book
on
neutral
ground
reardon
was
spending
a
week
at
hastings
a
rainy
day
drove
him
to
the
circulating
library
and
as
he
was
looking
along
the
shelves
for
something
readable
a
voice
near
at
hand
asked
the
attendant
if
he
had
anything
by
edwin
the
novelist
turned
in
astonishment
that
any
casual
mortal
should
inquire
for
his
books
seemed
incredible
of
course
there
was
nothing
by
that
author
in
the
library
and
he
who
had
asked
the
question
walked
out
again
on
the
morrow
reardon
encountered
this
same
man
at
a
lonely
part
of
the
shore
he
looked
at
him
and
spoke
a
word
or
two
of
common
civility
they
got
into
conversation
with
the
result
that
edwin
told
the
story
of
yesterday
the
stranger
introduced
himself
as
harold
biffen
an
author
in
a
small
way
and
a
teacher
whenever
he
could
get
pupils
an
abusive
review
had
interested
him
in
reardon
s
novels
but
as
yet
he
knew
nothing
of
them
but
the
names
their
tastes
were
found
to
be
in
many
respects
sympathetic
and
after
returning
to
london
they
saw
each
other
frequently
biffen
was
always
in
dire
poverty
and
lived
in
the
oddest
places
he
had
seen
harder
trials
than
even
reardon
himself
the
teaching
by
which
he
partly
lived
was
of
a
kind
quite
unknown
to
the
respectable
tutorial
world
in
these
days
of
examinations
numbers
of
men
in
a
poor
position
clerks
chiefly
conceive
a
hope
that
by
passing
this
that
or
the
other
formal
test
they
may
open
for
themselves
a
new
career
not
a
few
such
persons
nourish
preposterous
ambitions
there
are
warehouse
clerks
privately
preparing
without
any
means
or
prospect
of
them
for
a
call
to
the
bar
drapers
assistants
who
go
in
for
the
preliminary
examination
of
the
college
of
surgeons
and
untaught
men
innumerable
who
desire
to
procure
enough
show
of
education
to
be
eligible
for
a
curacy
candidates
of
this
stamp
frequently
advertise
in
the
newspapers
for
cheap
tuition
or
answer
advertisements
which
are
intended
to
appeal
to
them
they
pay
from
sixpence
to
an
hour
rarely
as
much
as
the
latter
sum
occasionally
it
happened
that
harold
biffen
had
three
or
four
such
pupils
in
hand
and
extraordinary
stories
he
could
draw
from
his
large
experience
in
this
sphere
then
as
to
his
but
shortly
after
the
discussion
of
greek
metres
he
fell
upon
the
subject
of
his
literary
projects
and
by
no
means
for
the
first
time
developed
the
theory
on
which
he
worked
i
have
thought
of
a
new
way
of
putting
it
what
i
really
aim
at
is
an
absolute
realism
in
the
sphere
of
the
ignobly
decent
the
field
as
i
understand
it
is
a
new
one
i
don
t
know
any
writer
who
has
treated
ordinary
vulgar
life
with
fidelity
and
seriousness
zola
writes
deliberate
tragedies
his
vilest
figures
become
heroic
from
the
place
they
fill
in
a
strongly
imagined
drama
i
want
to
deal
with
the
essentially
unheroic
with
the
life
of
that
vast
majority
of
people
who
are
at
the
mercy
of
paltry
circumstance
dickens
understood
the
possibility
of
such
work
but
his
tendency
to
melodrama
on
the
one
hand
and
his
humour
on
the
other
prevented
him
from
thinking
of
it
an
instance
now
as
i
came
along
by
regent
s
park
half
an
hour
ago
a
man
and
a
girl
were
walking
close
in
front
of
me
i
passed
them
slowly
and
heard
a
good
deal
of
their
talk
it
was
part
of
the
situation
that
they
should
pay
no
heed
to
a
stranger
s
proximity
now
such
a
as
that
has
absolutely
never
been
written
down
it
was
entirely
decent
yet
vulgar
to
the
nth
power
dickens
would
have
made
it
ludicrous
a
gross
injustice
other
men
who
deal
with
life
would
perhaps
have
preferred
idealising
it
an
absurdity
for
my
own
part
i
am
going
to
reproduce
it
verbatim
without
one
single
impertinent
suggestion
of
any
point
of
view
save
that
of
honest
reporting
the
result
will
be
something
unutterably
tedious
precisely
that
is
the
stamp
of
the
ignobly
decent
life
if
it
were
anything
but
tedious
it
would
be
untrue
i
speak
of
course
of
its
effect
upon
the
ordinary
i
couldn
t
do
it
said
reardon
certainly
you
couldn
t
you
well
you
are
a
psychological
realist
in
the
sphere
of
culture
you
are
impatient
of
vulgar
in
a
great
measure
because
my
life
has
been
martyred
by
and
for
that
very
same
reason
i
delight
in
them
cried
biffen
you
are
repelled
by
what
has
injured
you
i
am
attracted
by
it
this
divergence
is
very
interesting
but
for
that
we
should
have
resembled
each
other
so
closely
you
know
that
by
temper
we
are
rabid
idealists
both
of
i
suppose
but
let
me
go
on
i
want
among
other
things
to
insist
upon
the
fateful
power
of
trivial
incidents
no
one
has
yet
dared
to
do
this
seriously
it
has
often
been
done
in
farce
and
that
s
why
farcical
writing
so
often
makes
one
melancholy
you
know
my
stock
instances
of
the
kind
of
thing
i
mean
there
was
poor
allen
who
lost
the
most
valuable
opportunity
of
his
life
because
he
hadn
t
a
clean
shirt
to
put
on
and
williamson
who
would
probably
have
married
that
rich
girl
but
for
the
grain
of
dust
that
got
into
his
eye
and
made
him
unable
to
say
or
do
anything
at
the
critical
reardon
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
there
you
are
cried
biffen
with
friendly
annoyance
you
take
the
conventional
view
if
you
wrote
of
these
things
you
would
represent
them
as
they
are
laughable
asserted
the
other
however
serious
to
the
persons
concerned
the
mere
fact
of
grave
issues
in
life
depending
on
such
paltry
things
is
monstrously
ludicrous
life
is
a
huge
farce
and
the
advantage
of
possessing
a
sense
of
humour
is
that
it
enables
one
to
defy
fate
with
mocking
that
s
all
very
well
but
it
isn
t
an
original
view
i
am
not
lacking
in
sense
of
humour
but
i
prefer
to
treat
these
aspects
of
life
from
an
impartial
standpoint
the
man
who
laughs
takes
the
side
of
a
cruel
omnipotence
if
one
can
imagine
such
a
thing
i
want
to
take
no
side
at
all
simply
to
say
look
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
i
admire
your
honesty
biffen
said
reardon
sighing
you
will
never
sell
work
of
this
kind
yet
you
have
the
courage
to
go
on
with
it
because
you
believe
in
i
don
t
know
i
may
perhaps
sell
it
some
in
the
meantime
said
reardon
laying
down
his
pipe
suppose
we
eat
a
morsel
of
something
i
m
rather
in
the
early
days
of
his
marriage
reardon
was
wont
to
offer
the
friends
who
looked
in
on
sunday
evening
a
substantial
supper
by
degrees
the
meal
had
grown
simpler
until
now
in
the
depth
of
his
poverty
he
made
no
pretence
of
hospitable
entertainment
it
was
only
because
he
knew
that
biffen
as
often
as
not
had
nothing
whatever
to
eat
that
he
did
not
hesitate
to
offer
him
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
and
a
cup
of
tea
they
went
into
the
back
room
and
over
the
spartan
fare
continued
to
discuss
aspects
of
fiction
i
shall
never
said
biffen
write
anything
like
a
dramatic
scene
such
things
do
happen
in
life
but
so
very
rarely
that
they
are
nothing
to
my
purpose
even
when
they
happen
it
is
in
a
shape
that
would
be
useless
to
the
ordinary
novelist
he
would
have
to
cut
away
this
circumstance
and
add
that
why
i
should
like
to
know
such
conventionalism
results
from
stage
necessities
fiction
hasn
t
yet
outgrown
the
influence
of
the
stage
on
which
it
originated
whatever
a
man
writes
for
effect
is
wrong
and
only
in
your
view
there
may
surely
exist
such
a
thing
as
the
art
of
it
is
worked
out
we
must
have
a
rest
from
it
you
now
the
best
things
you
have
done
are
altogether
in
conflict
with
novelistic
conventionalities
it
was
because
that
blackguard
review
of
on
neutral
ground
clumsily
hinted
this
that
i
first
thought
of
you
with
interest
no
no
let
us
copy
life
when
the
man
and
woman
are
to
meet
for
a
great
scene
of
passion
let
it
all
be
frustrated
by
one
or
other
of
them
having
a
bad
cold
in
the
head
and
so
on
let
the
pretty
girl
get
a
disfiguring
pimple
on
her
nose
just
before
the
ball
at
which
she
is
going
to
shine
show
the
numberless
repulsive
features
of
common
decent
life
seriously
coldly
not
a
hint
of
facetiousness
or
the
thing
becomes
about
eight
o
clock
reardon
heard
his
wife
s
knock
at
the
door
on
opening
he
saw
not
only
amy
and
the
servant
the
latter
holding
willie
in
her
arms
but
with
them
jasper
milvain
i
have
been
at
mrs
yule
s
jasper
explained
as
he
came
in
have
you
anyone
here
ah
then
we
ll
discuss
that
s
over
for
the
evening
greek
metres
thank
heaven
the
three
men
seated
themselves
with
joking
and
laughter
and
the
smoke
of
their
pipes
gathered
thickly
in
the
little
room
it
was
half
an
hour
before
amy
joined
them
tobacco
was
no
disturbance
to
her
and
she
enjoyed
the
kind
of
talk
that
was
held
on
these
occasions
but
it
annoyed
her
that
she
could
no
longer
play
the
hostess
at
a
merry
why
ever
are
you
sitting
in
your
overcoat
mr
biffen
were
her
first
words
when
she
entered
please
excuse
me
mrs
reardon
it
happens
to
be
more
convenient
this
she
was
puzzled
but
a
glance
from
her
husband
warned
her
not
to
pursue
the
subject
biffen
always
behaved
to
amy
with
a
sincerity
of
respect
which
had
made
him
a
favourite
with
her
to
him
poor
fellow
reardon
seemed
supremely
blessed
that
a
struggling
man
of
letters
should
have
been
able
to
marry
and
such
a
wife
was
miraculous
in
biffen
s
eyes
a
woman
s
love
was
to
him
the
unattainable
ideal
already
years
old
he
had
no
prospect
of
ever
being
rich
enough
to
assure
himself
a
daily
dinner
marriage
was
wildly
out
of
the
question
sitting
here
he
found
it
very
difficult
not
to
gaze
at
amy
with
uncivil
persistency
seldom
in
his
life
had
he
conversed
with
educated
women
and
the
sound
of
this
clear
voice
was
always
more
delightful
to
him
than
any
music
amy
took
a
place
near
to
him
and
talked
in
her
most
charming
way
of
such
things
as
she
knew
interested
him
biffen
s
deferential
attitude
as
he
listened
and
replied
was
in
strong
contrast
with
the
careless
ease
which
marked
jasper
milvain
the
realist
would
never
smoke
in
amy
s
presence
but
jasper
puffed
jovial
clouds
even
whilst
she
was
conversing
with
him
whelpdale
came
to
see
me
last
night
remarked
milvain
presently
his
novel
is
refused
on
all
hands
he
talks
of
earning
a
living
as
a
commission
agent
for
some
i
can
t
understand
how
his
book
should
be
positively
refused
said
reardon
the
last
wasn
t
altogether
a
very
nearly
and
this
one
consists
of
nothing
but
a
series
of
conversations
between
two
people
it
is
really
a
dialogue
not
a
novel
at
all
he
read
me
some
twenty
pages
and
i
no
longer
wondered
that
he
couldn
t
sell
oh
but
it
has
considerable
merit
put
in
biffen
the
talk
is
remarkably
but
what
s
the
good
of
talk
that
leads
to
nothing
protested
jasper
it
s
a
bit
of
real
yes
but
it
has
no
market
value
you
may
write
what
you
like
so
long
as
people
are
willing
to
read
you
whelpdale
s
a
clever
fellow
but
he
can
t
hit
a
practical
like
some
other
people
i
have
heard
of
said
reardon
laughing
but
the
odd
thing
is
that
he
always
strikes
one
as
don
t
you
feel
that
mrs
reardon
he
and
amy
talked
for
a
few
minutes
and
reardon
seemingly
lost
in
meditation
now
and
then
observed
them
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
at
eleven
o
clock
husband
and
wife
were
alone
again
you
don
t
mean
to
say
exclaimed
amy
that
biffen
has
sold
his
coat
or
pawned
but
why
not
the
overcoat
partly
i
should
think
because
it
s
the
warmer
of
the
two
partly
perhaps
because
the
other
would
fetch
that
poor
man
will
die
of
starvation
some
day
i
think
it
not
i
hope
you
gave
him
something
to
eat
oh
yes
but
i
could
see
he
didn
t
like
to
take
as
much
as
he
wanted
i
don
t
think
of
him
with
so
much
pity
as
i
used
to
that
s
a
result
of
suffering
amy
set
her
lips
and
sighed
chapter
xi
respite
the
last
volume
was
written
in
fourteen
days
in
this
achievement
reardon
rose
almost
to
heroic
pitch
for
he
had
much
to
contend
with
beyond
the
mere
labour
of
composition
scarcely
had
he
begun
when
a
sharp
attack
of
lumbago
fell
upon
him
for
two
or
three
days
it
was
torture
to
support
himself
at
the
desk
and
he
moved
about
like
a
cripple
upon
this
ensued
headaches
general
enfeeblement
and
before
the
end
of
the
fortnight
it
was
necessary
to
think
of
raising
another
small
sum
of
money
he
took
his
watch
to
the
pawnbroker
s
you
can
imagine
that
it
would
not
stand
as
security
for
much
and
sold
a
few
more
books
all
this
notwithstanding
here
was
the
novel
at
length
finished
when
he
had
written
the
end
he
lay
back
closed
his
eyes
and
let
time
pass
in
blankness
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
remained
to
determine
the
title
but
his
brain
refused
another
effort
after
a
few
minutes
feeble
search
he
simply
took
the
name
of
the
chief
female
character
margaret
home
that
must
do
for
the
book
already
with
the
penning
of
the
last
word
all
its
scenes
personages
dialogues
had
slipped
away
into
oblivion
he
knew
and
cared
nothing
more
about
them
amy
you
will
have
to
correct
the
proofs
for
me
never
as
long
as
i
live
will
i
look
upon
a
page
of
this
accursed
novel
it
has
all
but
killed
the
point
is
replied
amy
that
here
we
have
it
complete
pack
it
up
and
take
it
to
the
publishers
i
and
you
will
ask
them
to
advance
you
a
few
pounds
i
but
that
undertaking
was
almost
as
hard
to
face
as
a
rewriting
of
the
last
volume
would
have
been
reardon
had
such
superfluity
of
sensitiveness
that
for
his
own
part
he
would
far
rather
have
gone
hungry
than
ask
for
money
not
legally
his
due
there
was
no
choice
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
it
would
be
certainly
a
month
before
he
heard
the
publishers
terms
and
perhaps
the
christmas
season
might
cause
yet
more
delay
without
borrowing
he
could
not
provide
for
the
expenses
of
more
than
another
week
or
two
his
parcel
under
his
arm
he
entered
the
office
and
desired
to
see
that
member
of
the
firm
with
whom
he
had
previously
had
personal
relations
this
gentleman
was
not
in
town
he
would
be
away
for
a
few
days
reardon
left
the
manuscript
and
came
out
into
the
street
again
he
crossed
and
looked
up
at
the
publishers
windows
from
the
opposite
pavement
do
they
suspect
in
what
wretched
circumstances
i
am
would
it
surprise
them
to
know
all
that
depends
upon
that
budget
of
paltry
scribbling
i
suppose
not
it
must
be
a
daily
experience
with
them
well
i
must
write
a
begging
it
was
raining
and
windy
he
went
slowly
homewards
and
was
on
the
point
of
entering
the
public
door
of
the
flats
when
his
uneasiness
became
so
great
that
he
turned
and
walked
past
if
he
went
in
he
must
at
once
write
his
appeal
for
money
and
he
felt
that
he
could
not
the
degradation
seemed
too
great
was
there
no
way
of
getting
over
the
next
few
weeks
rent
of
course
would
be
due
at
christmas
but
that
payment
might
be
postponed
it
was
only
a
question
of
buying
food
and
fuel
amy
had
offered
to
ask
her
mother
for
a
few
pounds
it
would
be
cowardly
to
put
this
task
upon
her
now
that
he
had
promised
to
meet
the
difficulty
himself
what
man
in
all
london
could
and
would
lend
him
money
he
reviewed
the
list
of
his
acquaintances
but
there
was
only
one
to
whom
he
could
appeal
with
the
slightest
hope
that
was
carter
half
an
hour
later
he
entered
that
same
hospital
door
through
which
some
years
ago
he
had
passed
as
a
applicant
for
work
the
matron
met
him
is
mr
carter
here
no
sir
but
we
expect
him
any
minute
will
you
wait
he
entered
the
familiar
office
and
sat
down
at
the
table
where
he
had
been
wont
to
work
a
young
clerk
was
writing
if
only
all
the
events
of
the
last
few
years
could
be
undone
and
he
with
no
soul
dependent
upon
him
be
once
more
earning
his
pound
a
week
in
this
room
what
a
happy
man
he
was
in
those
days
nearly
half
an
hour
passed
it
is
the
common
experience
of
beggars
to
have
to
wait
then
carter
came
in
with
quick
step
he
wore
a
heavy
ulster
of
the
latest
fashion
new
gloves
a
resplendent
silk
hat
his
cheeks
were
rosy
from
the
east
wind
ha
reardon
how
do
how
do
delighted
to
see
you
are
you
very
busy
well
no
not
particularly
a
few
cheques
to
sign
and
we
re
just
getting
out
our
christmas
appeals
you
remember
he
laughed
gaily
there
was
a
remarkable
freedom
from
snobbishness
in
this
young
man
the
fact
of
reardon
s
intellectual
superiority
had
long
ago
counteracted
carter
s
social
prejudices
i
should
like
to
have
a
word
with
right
you
are
they
went
into
a
small
inner
room
reardon
s
pulse
beat
at
his
tongue
was
cleaving
to
his
palate
what
is
it
old
man
asked
the
secretary
seating
himself
and
flinging
one
of
his
legs
over
the
other
you
look
rather
seedy
do
you
know
why
the
deuce
don
t
you
and
your
wife
look
us
up
now
and
then
i
ve
had
a
hard
pull
to
finish
my
finished
is
it
i
m
glad
to
hear
that
when
ll
it
be
out
i
ll
send
scores
of
people
to
mudie
s
after
it
thanks
but
i
don
t
think
much
of
it
to
tell
you
the
oh
we
know
what
that
reardon
was
talking
like
an
automaton
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
turned
screws
and
pressed
levers
for
the
utterance
of
his
next
words
i
may
as
well
say
at
once
what
i
have
come
for
could
you
lend
me
ten
pounds
for
a
month
in
fact
until
i
get
the
money
for
my
book
the
secretary
s
countenance
fell
though
not
to
that
expression
of
utter
coldness
which
would
have
come
naturally
under
the
circumstances
to
a
great
many
vivacious
men
he
seemed
genuinely
embarrassed
by
jove
i
confound
it
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
haven
t
ten
pounds
to
lend
upon
my
word
i
haven
t
reardon
these
infernal
housekeeping
expenses
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
old
man
that
edith
and
i
have
been
pushing
the
pace
he
laughed
and
thrust
his
hands
down
into
his
we
pay
such
a
darned
rent
you
know
hundred
and
we
ve
only
just
been
saying
we
should
have
to
draw
it
mild
for
the
rest
of
the
winter
but
i
m
infernally
sorry
upon
my
word
i
and
i
am
sorry
to
have
annoyed
you
by
the
unseasonable
devilish
seasonable
reardon
i
assure
you
cried
the
secretary
and
roared
at
his
joke
it
put
him
into
a
better
temper
than
ever
and
he
said
at
length
i
suppose
a
fiver
wouldn
t
be
much
use
for
a
month
you
say
i
might
manage
a
fiver
i
it
would
be
very
useful
but
on
no
account
if
no
no
i
could
manage
a
fiver
for
a
month
shall
i
give
you
a
cheque
i
m
ashamed
not
a
bit
of
it
i
ll
go
and
write
the
reardon
s
face
was
burning
of
the
conversation
that
followed
when
carter
again
presented
himself
he
never
recalled
a
word
the
bit
of
paper
was
crushed
together
in
his
hand
out
in
the
street
again
he
all
but
threw
it
away
dreaming
for
the
moment
that
it
was
a
bus
ticket
or
a
patent
medicine
bill
he
reached
home
much
after
the
amy
was
surprised
at
his
long
absence
got
anything
she
asked
it
was
half
his
intention
to
deceive
her
to
say
that
the
publishers
had
advanced
him
five
pounds
but
that
would
be
his
first
word
of
untruth
to
amy
and
why
should
he
be
guilty
of
it
he
told
her
all
that
had
happened
the
result
of
this
frankness
was
something
that
he
had
not
anticipated
amy
exhibited
profound
vexation
oh
you
shouldn
t
have
done
that
she
exclaimed
why
didn
t
you
come
home
and
tell
me
i
would
have
gone
to
mother
at
but
does
it
matter
of
course
it
does
she
replied
sharply
mr
carter
will
tell
his
wife
and
how
pleasant
that
is
i
never
thought
of
that
and
perhaps
it
wouldn
t
have
seemed
to
me
so
annoying
as
it
does
to
very
likely
she
turned
abruptly
away
and
stood
at
a
distance
in
gloomy
muteness
well
she
said
at
length
there
s
no
helping
it
now
come
and
have
your
you
have
taken
away
my
nonsense
i
suppose
you
re
dying
of
they
had
a
very
uncomfortable
meal
exchanging
few
words
on
amy
s
face
was
a
look
more
resembling
bad
temper
than
anything
reardon
had
ever
seen
there
after
dinner
he
went
and
sat
alone
in
the
study
amy
did
not
come
near
him
he
grew
stubbornly
angry
remembering
the
pain
he
had
gone
through
he
felt
that
amy
s
behaviour
to
him
was
cruel
she
must
come
and
speak
when
she
would
at
six
o
clock
she
showed
her
face
in
the
doorway
and
asked
if
he
would
come
to
tea
thank
you
he
replied
i
had
rather
stay
as
you
and
he
sat
alone
until
about
nine
it
was
only
then
he
recollected
that
he
must
send
a
note
to
the
publishers
calling
their
attention
to
the
parcel
he
had
left
he
wrote
it
and
closed
with
a
request
that
they
would
let
him
hear
as
soon
as
they
conveniently
could
as
he
was
putting
on
his
hat
and
coat
to
go
out
and
post
the
letter
amy
opened
the
door
you
re
going
out
shall
you
be
long
i
think
he
was
away
only
a
few
minutes
on
returning
he
went
first
of
all
into
the
study
but
the
thought
of
amy
alone
in
the
other
room
would
not
let
him
rest
he
looked
in
and
saw
that
she
was
sitting
without
a
fire
you
can
t
stay
here
in
the
cold
i
m
afraid
i
must
get
used
to
it
she
replied
affecting
to
be
closely
engaged
upon
some
sewing
that
strength
of
character
which
it
had
always
delighted
him
to
read
in
her
features
was
become
an
ominous
hardness
he
felt
his
heart
sink
as
he
looked
at
her
is
poverty
going
to
have
the
usual
result
in
our
case
he
asked
drawing
nearer
i
never
pretended
that
i
could
be
indifferent
to
still
don
t
you
care
to
try
and
resist
it
she
gave
no
answer
as
usual
in
conversation
with
an
aggrieved
woman
it
was
necessary
to
go
back
from
the
general
to
the
particular
i
m
afraid
he
said
that
the
carters
already
knew
pretty
well
how
things
were
going
with
that
s
a
very
different
thing
but
when
it
comes
to
asking
them
for
money
i
m
very
sorry
i
would
rather
have
done
anything
if
i
had
known
how
it
would
annoy
if
we
have
to
wait
a
month
five
pounds
will
be
very
little
use
to
she
detailed
all
manner
of
expenses
that
had
to
be
met
outlay
there
was
no
possibility
of
avoiding
so
long
as
their
life
was
maintained
on
its
present
basis
however
you
needn
t
trouble
any
more
about
it
i
ll
see
to
it
now
you
are
free
from
your
book
try
to
come
and
sit
by
the
fire
there
s
small
chance
of
rest
for
me
if
we
are
thinking
unkindly
of
each
a
doleful
christmas
week
after
week
went
by
and
reardon
knew
that
amy
must
have
exhausted
the
money
he
had
given
her
but
she
made
no
more
demands
upon
him
and
necessaries
were
paid
for
in
the
usual
way
he
suffered
from
a
sense
of
humiliation
sometimes
he
found
it
difficult
to
look
in
his
wife
s
face
when
the
publishers
letter
came
it
contained
an
offer
of
pounds
for
the
copyright
of
margaret
home
more
to
be
paid
if
the
sale
in
form
should
reach
a
certain
number
of
copies
here
was
failure
put
into
unmistakable
figures
reardon
said
to
himself
that
it
was
all
over
with
his
profession
of
authorship
the
book
could
not
possibly
succeed
even
to
the
point
of
completing
his
hundred
pounds
it
would
meet
with
universal
contempt
and
indeed
deserved
nothing
better
shall
you
accept
this
asked
amy
after
dreary
silence
no
one
else
would
offer
terms
as
will
they
pay
you
at
once
i
must
ask
them
well
it
was
pounds
in
hand
the
cheque
came
as
soon
as
it
was
requested
and
reardon
s
face
brightened
for
the
moment
blessed
money
root
of
all
good
until
the
world
invent
some
saner
economy
how
much
do
you
owe
your
mother
he
inquired
without
looking
at
amy
six
pounds
she
answered
coldly
and
five
to
carter
and
rent
twelve
pounds
ten
we
shall
have
a
matter
of
fifty
pounds
to
go
on
chapter
xii
work
without
hope
the
prudent
course
was
so
obvious
that
he
marvelled
at
amy
s
failing
to
suggest
it
for
people
in
their
circumstances
to
be
paying
a
rent
of
fifty
pounds
when
a
home
could
be
found
for
half
the
money
was
recklessness
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
letting
the
flat
for
this
last
year
of
their
lease
and
the
cost
of
removal
would
be
trifling
the
mental
relief
of
such
a
change
might
enable
him
to
front
with
courage
a
problem
in
any
case
very
difficult
and
as
things
were
desperate
three
months
ago
in
a
moment
of
profoundest
misery
he
had
proposed
this
step
courage
failed
him
to
speak
of
it
again
amy
s
look
and
voice
were
too
vivid
in
his
memory
was
she
not
capable
of
such
a
sacrifice
for
his
sake
did
she
prefer
to
let
him
bear
all
the
responsibility
of
whatever
might
result
from
a
futile
struggle
to
keep
up
appearances
between
him
and
her
there
was
no
longer
perfect
confidence
her
silence
meant
reproach
and
whatever
might
have
been
the
case
before
there
was
no
doubt
that
she
now
discussed
him
with
her
mother
possibly
with
other
people
it
was
not
likely
that
she
concealed
his
own
opinion
of
the
book
he
had
just
finished
all
their
acquaintances
would
be
prepared
to
greet
its
publication
with
private
scoffing
or
with
mournful
shaking
of
the
head
his
feeling
towards
amy
entered
upon
a
new
phase
the
stability
of
his
love
was
a
source
of
pain
condemning
himself
he
felt
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
wronged
a
coldness
which
was
far
from
representing
the
truth
began
to
affect
his
manner
and
speech
and
amy
did
not
seem
to
notice
it
at
all
events
she
made
no
kind
of
protest
they
no
longer
talked
of
the
old
subjects
but
of
those
mean
concerns
of
material
life
which
formerly
they
had
agreed
to
dismiss
as
quickly
as
possible
their
relations
to
each
other
not
long
ago
an
inexhaustible
topic
would
not
bear
spoken
comment
both
were
too
conscious
of
the
when
they
looked
that
way
in
the
time
of
waiting
for
the
publishers
offer
and
now
again
when
he
was
asking
himself
how
he
should
use
the
respite
granted
him
reardon
spent
his
days
at
the
british
museum
he
could
not
read
to
much
purpose
but
it
was
better
to
sit
here
among
strangers
than
seem
to
be
idling
under
amy
s
glance
sick
of
imaginative
writing
he
turned
to
the
studies
which
had
always
been
most
congenial
and
tried
to
shape
out
a
paper
or
two
like
those
he
had
formerly
disposed
of
to
editors
among
his
unused
material
lay
a
mass
of
notes
he
had
made
in
a
reading
of
diogenes
laertius
and
it
seemed
to
him
now
that
he
might
make
something
salable
out
of
these
anecdotes
of
the
philosophers
in
a
happier
mood
he
could
have
written
delightfully
on
such
a
subject
not
learnedly
but
in
the
strain
of
a
modern
man
whose
humour
and
sensibility
find
free
play
among
the
classic
ghosts
even
now
he
was
able
to
recover
something
of
the
light
touch
which
had
given
value
to
his
published
essays
meanwhile
the
first
number
of
the
current
had
appeared
and
jasper
milvain
had
made
a
palpable
hit
amy
spoke
very
often
of
the
article
called
typical
readers
and
her
interest
in
its
author
was
freely
manifested
whenever
a
mention
of
jasper
came
under
her
notice
she
read
it
out
to
her
husband
reardon
smiled
and
appeared
glad
but
he
did
not
care
to
discuss
milvain
with
the
same
frankness
as
formerly
one
evening
at
the
end
of
january
he
told
amy
what
he
had
been
writing
at
the
museum
and
asked
her
if
she
would
care
to
hear
it
read
i
began
to
wonder
what
you
were
doing
she
replied
then
why
didn
t
you
ask
me
i
was
rather
afraid
why
afraid
it
would
have
seemed
like
reminding
you
that
you
know
what
i
that
a
month
or
two
more
will
see
us
at
the
same
crisis
again
still
i
had
rather
you
had
shown
an
interest
in
my
after
a
pause
amy
asked
do
you
think
you
can
get
a
paper
of
this
kind
accepted
it
isn
t
impossible
i
think
it
s
rather
well
done
let
me
read
you
a
page
where
will
you
send
it
she
interrupted
to
the
why
not
try
the
current
ask
milvain
to
introduce
you
to
mr
fadge
they
pay
much
better
you
but
this
isn
t
so
well
suited
for
fadge
and
i
much
prefer
to
be
independent
as
long
as
it
s
that
s
one
of
your
faults
edwin
remarked
his
wife
mildly
it
s
only
the
strongest
men
that
can
make
their
way
independently
you
ought
to
use
every
means
that
seeing
that
i
am
so
weak
i
didn
t
think
it
would
offend
you
i
only
meant
no
no
you
are
quite
right
certainly
i
am
one
of
the
men
who
need
all
the
help
they
can
get
but
i
assure
you
this
thing
won
t
do
for
the
what
a
pity
you
will
go
back
to
those
musty
old
times
now
think
of
that
article
of
milvain
s
if
only
you
could
do
something
of
that
kind
what
do
people
care
about
diogenes
and
his
tub
and
his
lantern
my
dear
girl
diogenes
laertius
had
neither
tub
nor
lantern
that
i
know
of
you
are
making
a
mistake
but
it
doesn
t
no
i
don
t
think
it
the
caustic
note
was
not
very
pleasant
on
amy
s
lips
whoever
he
was
the
mass
of
readers
will
be
frightened
by
his
well
we
have
to
recognise
that
the
mass
of
readers
will
never
care
for
anything
i
you
will
never
convince
me
that
you
couldn
t
write
in
a
popular
way
if
you
tried
i
m
sure
you
are
quite
as
clever
as
milvain
reardon
made
an
impatient
gesture
do
leave
milvain
aside
for
a
little
he
and
i
are
as
unlike
as
two
men
could
be
what
s
the
use
of
constantly
comparing
us
amy
looked
at
him
he
had
never
spoken
to
her
so
brusquely
how
can
you
say
that
i
am
constantly
comparing
you
if
not
in
spoken
words
then
in
your
that
s
not
a
very
nice
thing
to
say
you
make
it
so
unmistakable
amy
what
i
mean
is
that
you
are
always
regretting
the
difference
between
him
and
me
you
lament
that
i
can
t
write
in
that
attractive
way
well
i
lament
it
myself
for
your
sake
i
wish
i
had
milvain
s
peculiar
talent
so
that
i
could
get
reputation
and
money
but
i
haven
t
and
there
s
an
end
of
it
it
irritates
a
man
to
be
perpetually
told
of
his
i
will
never
mention
milvain
s
name
again
said
amy
coldly
now
that
s
ridiculous
and
you
know
i
feel
the
same
about
your
irritation
i
can
t
see
that
i
have
given
any
cause
for
then
we
ll
talk
no
more
of
the
reardon
threw
his
manuscript
aside
and
opened
a
book
amy
never
asked
him
to
resume
his
intention
of
reading
what
he
had
written
however
the
paper
was
accepted
it
came
out
in
the
wayside
for
march
and
reardon
received
seven
pounds
ten
for
it
by
that
time
he
had
written
another
thing
of
the
same
gossipy
kind
suggested
by
pliny
s
letters
the
pleasant
occupation
did
him
good
but
there
was
no
possibility
of
pursuing
this
course
margaret
home
would
be
published
in
april
he
might
get
the
pounds
contingent
upon
a
certain
sale
yet
that
could
in
no
case
be
paid
until
the
middle
of
the
year
and
long
before
then
he
would
be
penniless
his
respite
drew
to
an
end
but
now
he
took
counsel
of
no
one
as
far
as
it
was
possible
he
lived
in
solitude
never
seeing
those
of
his
acquaintances
who
were
outside
the
literary
world
and
seldom
even
his
colleagues
milvain
was
so
busy
that
he
had
only
been
able
to
look
in
twice
or
thrice
since
christmas
and
reardon
nowadays
never
went
to
jasper
s
lodgings
he
had
the
conviction
that
all
was
over
with
the
happiness
of
his
married
life
though
how
the
events
which
were
to
express
this
ruin
would
shape
themselves
he
could
not
foresee
amy
was
revealing
that
aspect
of
her
character
to
which
he
had
been
blind
though
a
practical
man
would
have
perceived
it
from
the
first
so
far
from
helping
him
to
support
poverty
she
perhaps
would
even
refuse
to
share
it
with
him
he
knew
that
she
was
slowly
drawing
apart
already
there
was
a
divorce
between
their
minds
and
he
tortured
himself
in
uncertainty
as
to
how
far
he
retained
her
affections
a
word
of
tenderness
a
caress
no
longer
met
with
response
from
her
her
softest
mood
was
that
of
mere
comradeship
all
the
warmth
of
her
nature
was
expended
upon
the
child
reardon
learnt
how
easy
it
is
for
a
mother
to
forget
that
both
parents
have
a
share
in
her
offspring
he
was
beginning
to
dislike
the
child
but
for
willie
s
existence
amy
would
still
love
him
with
undivided
heart
not
perhaps
so
passionately
as
once
but
still
with
lover
s
love
and
amy
understood
or
at
all
events
remarked
this
change
in
him
she
was
aware
that
he
seldom
asked
a
question
about
willie
and
that
he
listened
with
indifference
when
she
spoke
of
the
little
fellow
s
progress
in
part
offended
she
was
also
in
part
pleased
but
for
the
child
mere
poverty
he
said
to
himself
should
never
have
sundered
them
in
the
strength
of
his
passion
he
could
have
overcome
all
her
disappointments
and
indeed
but
for
that
new
care
he
would
most
likely
never
have
fallen
to
this
extremity
of
helplessness
it
is
natural
in
a
weak
and
sensitive
man
to
dream
of
possibilities
disturbed
by
the
force
of
circumstance
for
one
hour
which
he
gave
to
conflict
with
his
present
difficulties
reardon
spent
many
in
contemplation
of
the
happiness
that
might
have
been
even
yet
it
needed
but
a
little
money
to
redeem
all
amy
had
no
extravagant
aspirations
a
home
of
simple
refinement
and
freedom
from
anxiety
would
restore
her
to
her
nobler
self
how
could
he
find
fault
with
her
she
knew
nothing
of
such
sordid
life
as
he
had
gone
through
and
to
lack
money
for
necessities
seemed
to
her
degrading
beyond
endurance
why
even
the
ordinary
artisan
s
wife
does
not
suffer
such
privations
as
hers
at
the
end
of
the
past
year
for
lack
of
that
little
money
his
life
must
be
ruined
of
late
he
had
often
thought
about
the
rich
uncle
john
yule
who
might
perhaps
leave
something
to
amy
but
the
hope
was
so
uncertain
and
supposing
such
a
thing
were
to
happen
would
it
be
perfectly
easy
to
live
upon
his
wife
s
bounty
perhaps
exhausting
a
small
capital
so
that
some
years
hence
their
position
would
be
no
better
than
before
not
long
ago
he
could
have
taken
anything
from
amy
s
hand
would
it
be
so
simple
since
the
change
that
had
come
between
them
having
written
his
second
it
was
rejected
by
two
editors
and
he
had
no
choice
but
to
hold
it
over
until
sufficient
time
had
elapsed
to
allow
of
his
again
trying
the
wayside
he
saw
that
he
must
perforce
plan
another
novel
but
this
time
he
was
resolute
not
to
undertake
three
volumes
the
advertisements
informed
him
that
numbers
of
authors
were
abandoning
that
procrustean
system
hopeless
as
he
was
he
might
as
well
try
his
chance
with
a
book
which
could
be
written
in
a
few
weeks
and
why
not
a
glaringly
artificial
story
with
a
sensational
title
it
could
not
be
worse
than
what
he
had
last
written
so
without
a
word
to
amy
he
put
aside
his
purely
intellectual
work
and
began
once
more
the
search
for
a
this
was
towards
the
end
of
february
the
proofs
of
margaret
home
were
coming
in
day
by
day
amy
had
offered
to
correct
them
but
after
all
he
preferred
to
keep
his
shame
to
himself
as
long
as
possible
and
with
a
hurried
reading
he
dismissed
sheet
after
sheet
his
imagination
did
not
work
the
more
happily
for
this
repugnant
task
still
he
hit
at
length
upon
a
conception
which
seemed
absurd
enough
for
the
purpose
before
him
whether
he
could
persevere
with
it
even
to
the
extent
of
one
volume
was
very
doubtful
but
it
should
not
be
said
of
him
that
he
abandoned
his
wife
and
child
to
penury
without
one
effort
of
the
kind
that
milvain
and
amy
herself
had
recommended
writing
a
page
or
two
of
manuscript
daily
and
with
several
holocausts
to
retard
him
he
had
done
nearly
a
quarter
of
the
story
when
there
came
a
note
from
jasper
telling
of
mrs
milvain
s
death
he
handed
it
across
the
to
amy
and
watched
her
as
she
read
it
i
suppose
it
doesn
t
alter
his
position
amy
remarked
without
much
interest
i
suppose
not
appreciably
he
told
me
once
his
mother
had
a
sufficient
income
but
whatever
she
leaves
will
go
to
his
sisters
i
should
think
he
has
never
said
much
to
nearly
three
weeks
passed
before
they
heard
anything
more
from
jasper
himself
then
he
wrote
again
from
the
country
saying
that
he
purposed
bringing
his
sisters
to
live
in
london
another
week
and
one
evening
he
appeared
at
the
door
a
want
of
heartiness
in
reardon
s
reception
of
him
might
have
been
explained
as
gravity
natural
under
the
circumstances
but
jasper
had
before
this
become
conscious
that
he
was
not
welcomed
here
quite
so
cheerily
as
in
the
old
days
he
remarked
it
distinctly
on
that
evening
when
he
accompanied
amy
home
from
mrs
yule
s
since
then
he
had
allowed
his
pressing
occupations
to
be
an
excuse
for
the
paucity
of
his
visits
it
seemed
to
him
perfectly
intelligible
that
reardon
sinking
into
literary
insignificance
should
grow
cool
to
a
man
entering
upon
a
successful
career
the
vein
of
cynicism
in
jasper
enabled
him
to
pardon
a
weakness
of
this
kind
which
in
some
measure
flattered
him
but
he
both
liked
and
respected
reardon
and
at
present
he
was
in
the
mood
to
give
expression
to
his
warmer
feelings
your
book
is
announced
i
see
he
said
with
an
accent
of
pleasure
as
soon
as
he
had
seated
himself
i
didn
t
know
yes
new
novel
by
the
author
of
on
neutral
down
for
the
sixteenth
of
april
and
i
have
a
proposal
to
make
about
it
will
you
let
me
ask
fadge
to
have
it
noticed
in
books
of
the
month
in
the
may
current
i
strongly
advise
you
to
let
it
take
its
chance
the
book
isn
t
worth
special
notice
and
whoever
undertook
to
review
it
for
fadge
would
either
have
to
lie
or
stultify
the
jasper
turned
to
amy
now
what
is
to
be
done
with
a
man
like
this
what
is
one
to
say
to
him
mrs
reardon
edwin
dislikes
the
book
amy
replied
carelessly
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
we
know
quite
well
that
in
anything
he
writes
there
ll
be
something
for
a
reviewer
to
make
a
good
deal
of
if
fadge
will
let
me
i
should
do
the
thing
neither
reardon
nor
his
wife
spoke
of
course
went
on
milvain
looking
at
the
former
if
you
had
rather
i
left
it
alone
i
had
much
rather
please
don
t
say
anything
about
there
was
an
awkward
silence
amy
broke
it
by
saying
are
your
sisters
in
town
mr
milvain
yes
we
came
up
two
days
ago
i
found
lodgings
for
them
not
far
from
mornington
road
poor
girls
they
don
t
quite
know
where
they
are
yet
of
course
they
will
keep
very
quiet
for
a
time
then
i
must
try
to
get
friends
for
them
well
they
have
one
already
your
cousin
miss
yule
she
has
already
been
to
see
i
m
very
glad
of
amy
took
an
opportunity
of
studying
his
face
there
was
again
a
silence
as
if
of
constraint
reardon
glancing
at
his
wife
said
with
hesitation
when
they
care
to
see
other
visitors
i
m
sure
amy
would
be
very
glad
certainly
his
wife
added
thank
you
very
much
of
course
i
knew
i
could
depend
on
mrs
reardon
to
show
them
kindness
in
that
way
but
let
me
speak
frankly
of
something
my
sisters
have
made
quite
a
friend
of
miss
yule
since
she
was
down
there
last
year
wouldn
t
that
he
turned
to
amy
cause
you
a
little
awkwardness
amy
had
a
difficulty
in
replying
she
kept
her
eyes
on
the
ground
you
have
had
no
quarrel
with
your
cousin
remarked
reardon
none
whatever
it
s
only
my
mother
and
my
i
can
t
imagine
miss
yule
having
a
quarrel
with
anyone
said
jasper
then
he
added
quickly
well
things
must
shape
themselves
naturally
we
shall
see
for
the
present
they
will
be
fully
occupied
of
course
it
s
best
that
they
should
be
i
shall
see
them
every
day
and
miss
yule
will
come
pretty
often
i
dare
reardon
caught
amy
s
eye
but
at
once
looked
away
again
my
word
exclaimed
milvain
after
a
moment
s
meditation
it
s
well
this
didn
t
happen
a
year
ago
the
girls
have
no
income
only
a
little
cash
to
go
on
with
we
shall
have
our
work
set
it
s
a
precious
lucky
thing
that
i
have
just
got
a
sort
of
reardon
muttered
an
assent
and
what
are
you
doing
now
jasper
inquired
suddenly
writing
a
i
m
glad
to
hear
that
any
special
plan
for
its
publication
then
why
not
offer
it
to
jedwood
he
s
publishing
a
series
of
novels
you
know
of
jedwood
don
t
you
he
was
culpepper
s
manager
started
business
about
half
a
year
ago
and
it
looks
as
if
he
would
do
well
he
married
that
woman
what
s
her
name
who
wrote
mr
henderson
s
wives
never
heard
of
nonsense
miss
wilkes
of
course
well
she
married
this
fellow
jedwood
and
there
was
a
great
row
about
something
or
other
between
him
and
her
publishers
mrs
boston
wright
told
me
all
about
it
an
astonishing
woman
that
a
cyclopaedia
of
the
day
s
small
talk
i
m
quite
a
favourite
with
her
she
s
promised
to
help
the
girls
all
she
can
well
but
i
was
talking
about
jedwood
why
not
offer
him
this
book
of
yours
he
s
eager
to
get
hold
of
the
new
writers
advertises
hugely
he
has
the
whole
back
page
of
the
study
about
every
other
week
i
suppose
miss
wilkes
s
profits
are
paying
for
it
he
has
just
given
markland
two
hundred
pounds
for
a
paltry
little
tale
that
would
scarcely
swell
out
to
a
volume
markland
told
me
himself
you
know
that
i
ve
scraped
an
acquaintance
with
him
oh
i
suppose
i
haven
t
seen
you
since
then
he
s
a
dwarfish
fellow
with
only
one
eye
mrs
boston
wright
cries
him
up
at
every
who
is
mrs
boston
wright
asked
reardon
laughing
impatiently
edits
the
english
girl
you
know
she
s
had
an
extraordinary
life
was
born
in
mauritius
no
ceylon
i
forget
some
such
place
married
a
sailor
at
fifteen
was
shipwrecked
somewhere
and
only
restored
to
life
after
terrific
efforts
her
story
leaves
it
all
rather
vague
then
she
turns
up
as
a
newspaper
correspondent
at
the
cape
gave
up
that
and
took
to
some
kind
of
farming
i
forget
where
married
again
first
husband
lost
in
aforementioned
shipwreck
this
time
a
baptist
minister
and
began
to
devote
herself
to
in
liverpool
husband
burned
to
death
somewhere
she
s
next
discovered
in
the
thick
of
literary
society
in
london
a
wonderful
woman
i
assure
you
must
be
nearly
fifty
but
she
looks
he
paused
then
added
impulsively
let
me
take
you
to
one
of
her
evenings
nine
on
thursday
do
persuade
him
mrs
reardon
reardon
shook
his
head
no
no
i
should
be
horribly
out
of
my
i
can
t
see
why
you
would
meet
all
sorts
of
people
those
you
ought
to
have
met
long
ago
better
still
let
me
ask
her
to
send
an
invitation
for
both
of
you
i
m
sure
you
d
like
her
mrs
reardon
there
s
a
good
deal
of
humbug
about
her
it
s
true
but
some
solid
qualities
as
well
no
one
has
a
word
to
say
against
her
and
it
s
a
splendid
advertisement
to
have
her
for
a
friend
she
ll
talk
about
your
books
and
articles
till
all
is
amy
gave
a
questioning
look
at
her
husband
but
reardon
moved
in
an
uncomfortable
way
we
ll
see
about
it
he
said
some
day
let
me
know
whenever
you
feel
disposed
but
about
jedwood
i
happen
to
know
a
man
who
reads
for
heavens
cried
reardon
who
don
t
you
know
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
at
present
it
s
a
large
part
of
my
business
to
make
acquaintances
why
look
you
a
man
who
has
to
live
by
miscellaneous
writing
couldn
t
get
on
without
a
vast
variety
of
acquaintances
one
s
own
brain
would
soon
run
dry
a
clever
fellow
knows
how
to
use
the
brains
of
other
amy
listened
with
an
unconscious
smile
which
expressed
keen
interest
oh
pursued
jasper
when
did
you
see
whelpdale
last
haven
t
seen
him
for
a
long
you
don
t
know
what
he
s
doing
the
fellow
has
set
up
as
a
literary
he
has
an
advertisement
in
the
study
every
week
to
young
authors
and
literary
aspirants
something
of
the
kind
advice
given
on
choice
of
subjects
mss
read
corrected
and
recommended
to
publishers
moderate
a
fact
and
what
s
more
he
made
six
guineas
in
the
first
fortnight
so
he
says
at
all
events
now
that
s
one
of
the
finest
jokes
i
ever
heard
a
man
who
can
t
get
anyone
to
publish
his
own
books
makes
a
living
by
telling
other
people
how
to
write
but
it
s
a
confounded
swindle
oh
i
don
t
know
he
s
capable
of
correcting
the
grammar
of
literary
aspirants
and
as
for
recommending
to
publishers
well
anyone
can
recommend
i
reardon
s
indignation
yielded
to
laughter
it
s
not
impossible
that
he
may
thrive
by
this
kind
of
not
at
all
assented
jasper
shortly
after
this
he
looked
at
his
watch
i
must
be
off
my
friends
i
have
something
to
write
before
i
can
go
to
my
and
it
ll
take
me
three
hours
at
least
old
man
let
me
know
when
your
story
s
finished
and
we
ll
talk
about
it
and
think
about
mrs
boston
wright
oh
and
about
that
review
in
the
current
i
wish
you
d
let
me
do
it
talk
it
over
with
your
guide
philosopher
and
he
indicated
amy
who
laughed
in
a
forced
way
when
he
was
gone
the
two
sat
without
speaking
for
several
minutes
do
you
care
to
make
friends
with
those
girls
asked
reardon
at
length
i
suppose
in
decency
i
must
call
upon
them
i
suppose
you
may
find
them
very
oh
they
conversed
with
their
own
thoughts
for
a
while
then
reardon
burst
out
laughing
well
there
s
the
successful
man
you
see
some
day
he
ll
live
in
a
mansion
and
dictate
literary
opinions
to
the
how
has
he
offended
you
offended
me
not
at
all
i
am
glad
of
his
cheerful
why
should
you
refuse
to
go
among
those
people
it
might
be
good
for
you
in
several
if
the
chance
had
come
when
i
was
publishing
my
best
work
i
dare
say
i
shouldn
t
have
refused
but
i
certainly
shall
not
present
myself
as
the
author
of
margaret
home
and
the
rubbish
i
m
now
then
you
must
cease
to
write
yes
i
must
cease
to
write
and
do
what
i
wish
to
heaven
i
knew
chapter
xiii
a
warning
in
the
spring
list
of
mr
jedwood
s
publications
announcement
was
made
of
a
new
work
by
alfred
yule
it
was
called
english
prose
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
consisted
of
a
number
of
essays
several
of
which
had
already
seen
the
light
in
periodicals
strung
into
continuity
the
final
chapter
dealt
with
contemporary
writers
more
especially
those
who
served
to
illustrate
the
author
s
theme
that
journalism
is
the
destruction
of
prose
style
on
certain
popular
writers
of
the
day
there
was
an
outpouring
of
gall
which
was
not
likely
to
be
received
as
though
it
were
sweet
ointment
the
book
met
with
rather
severe
treatment
in
critical
columns
it
could
scarcely
be
ignored
the
safest
mode
of
attack
when
one
s
author
has
no
expectant
public
and
only
the
most
skilful
could
write
of
it
in
a
hostile
spirit
without
betraying
that
some
of
its
strokes
had
told
an
evening
newspaper
which
piqued
itself
on
independence
indulged
in
laughing
appreciation
of
the
polemical
chapter
and
the
next
day
printed
a
scornful
letter
from
a
correspondent
who
assailed
both
book
and
reviewer
for
the
moment
people
talked
more
of
alfred
yule
than
they
had
done
since
his
memorable
conflict
with
clement
fadge
the
publisher
had
hoped
for
this
mr
jedwood
was
an
energetic
and
sanguine
man
who
had
entered
upon
his
business
with
a
determination
to
rival
in
a
year
or
so
the
houses
which
had
slowly
risen
into
commanding
stability
he
had
no
great
capital
but
the
stroke
of
fortune
which
had
wedded
him
to
a
popular
novelist
enabled
him
to
count
on
steady
profit
from
one
source
and
boundless
faith
in
his
own
judgment
urged
him
to
an
initial
outlay
which
made
the
prudent
shake
their
heads
he
talked
much
of
the
new
era
foresaw
revolutions
in
publishing
and
planned
every
week
a
score
of
untried
ventures
which
should
appeal
to
the
democratic
generation
just
maturing
in
the
meantime
was
ready
to
publish
anything
which
seemed
likely
to
get
talked
about
the
may
number
of
the
current
in
its
article
headed
books
of
the
month
devoted
about
half
a
page
to
english
prose
in
the
nineteenth
this
notice
was
a
consummate
example
of
the
flippant
style
of
attack
flippancy
the
most
hopeless
form
of
intellectual
vice
was
a
characterising
note
of
mr
fadge
s
periodical
his
monthly
comments
on
publications
were
already
looked
for
with
eagerness
by
that
growing
class
of
readers
who
care
for
nothing
but
what
can
be
made
matter
of
ridicule
the
hostility
of
other
reviewers
was
awkward
and
ineffectual
compared
with
this
venomous
banter
which
entertained
by
showing
that
in
the
book
under
notice
there
was
neither
entertainment
nor
any
other
kind
of
interest
to
assail
an
author
without
increasing
the
number
of
his
readers
is
the
perfection
of
journalistic
skill
and
the
current
had
it
stood
alone
would
fully
have
achieved
this
end
as
it
was
silence
might
have
been
better
tactics
but
mr
fadge
knew
that
his
enemy
would
smart
under
the
poisoned
and
that
was
something
gained
on
the
day
that
the
current
appeared
its
treatment
of
alfred
yule
was
discussed
in
mr
jedwood
s
private
office
mr
quarmby
who
had
intimate
relations
with
the
publisher
happened
to
look
in
just
as
a
young
man
one
of
mr
jedwood
s
readers
was
expressing
a
doubt
whether
fadge
himself
was
the
author
of
the
review
but
there
s
fadge
s
all
down
the
page
cried
mr
quarmby
he
inspired
the
thing
of
course
but
i
rather
think
it
was
written
by
that
fellow
think
so
asked
the
publisher
well
i
know
with
certainty
that
the
notice
of
markland
s
novel
is
his
writing
and
i
have
reasons
for
suspecting
that
he
did
yule
s
book
as
smart
youngster
that
remarked
mr
jedwood
who
is
he
somebody
s
illegitimate
son
i
believe
replied
the
source
of
trustworthy
information
with
a
laugh
denham
says
he
met
him
in
new
york
a
year
or
two
ago
under
another
name
excuse
me
interposed
mr
quarmby
there
s
some
mistake
in
all
he
went
on
to
state
what
he
knew
from
yule
himself
concerning
milvain
s
history
though
in
this
instance
a
corrector
mr
quarmby
took
an
opportunity
a
few
hours
later
of
informing
mr
hinks
that
the
attack
on
yule
in
the
current
was
almost
certainly
written
by
young
milvain
with
the
result
that
when
the
rumour
reached
yule
s
ears
it
was
delivered
as
an
undoubted
and
fact
it
was
a
month
prior
to
this
that
milvain
made
his
call
upon
marian
yule
on
the
sunday
when
her
father
was
absent
when
told
of
the
visit
yule
assumed
a
manner
of
indifference
but
his
daughter
understood
that
he
was
annoyed
with
regard
to
the
sisters
who
would
shortly
be
living
in
london
he
merely
said
that
marian
must
behave
as
discretion
directed
her
if
she
wished
to
invite
the
miss
milvains
to
st
paul
s
crescent
he
only
begged
that
the
times
and
seasons
of
the
household
might
not
be
disturbed
as
her
habit
was
marian
took
refuge
in
silence
nothing
could
have
been
more
welcome
to
her
than
the
proximity
of
maud
and
dora
but
she
foresaw
that
her
own
home
would
not
be
freely
open
to
them
perhaps
it
might
be
necessary
to
behave
with
simple
frankness
and
let
her
friends
know
the
embarrassments
of
the
situation
but
that
could
not
be
done
in
the
first
instance
the
unkindness
would
seem
too
great
a
day
after
the
arrival
of
the
girls
she
received
a
note
from
dora
and
almost
at
once
replied
to
it
by
calling
at
her
friends
lodgings
a
week
after
that
maud
and
dora
came
to
st
paul
s
crescent
it
was
sunday
and
mr
yule
purposely
kept
away
from
home
they
had
only
been
once
to
the
house
since
then
again
without
meeting
mr
yule
marian
however
visited
them
at
their
lodgings
frequently
now
and
then
she
met
jasper
there
the
latter
never
spoke
of
her
father
and
there
was
no
question
of
inviting
him
to
repeat
his
call
in
the
end
marian
was
obliged
to
speak
on
the
subject
with
her
mother
mrs
yule
offered
an
occasion
by
asking
when
the
miss
milvains
were
coming
again
i
don
t
think
i
shall
ever
ask
them
again
marian
replied
her
mother
understood
and
looked
troubled
i
must
tell
them
how
it
is
that
s
all
the
girl
went
on
they
are
sensible
they
won
t
be
offended
with
but
your
father
has
never
had
anything
to
say
against
them
urged
mrs
yule
not
a
word
to
me
marian
i
d
tell
you
the
truth
if
he
it
s
too
disagreeable
all
the
same
i
can
t
invite
them
here
with
pleasure
father
has
grown
prejudiced
against
them
all
and
he
won
t
change
no
i
shall
just
tell
it
s
very
hard
for
you
sighed
her
mother
if
i
thought
i
could
do
any
good
by
speaking
but
i
can
t
my
i
know
it
mother
let
us
go
on
as
we
did
the
day
after
this
when
yule
came
home
about
the
hour
of
dinner
he
called
marian
s
name
from
within
the
study
marian
had
not
left
the
house
her
work
had
been
set
in
the
shape
of
a
long
task
of
copying
from
disorderly
manuscript
she
left
the
in
obedience
to
her
father
s
summons
here
s
something
that
will
afford
you
amusement
he
said
holding
to
her
the
new
number
of
the
current
and
indicating
the
notice
of
his
book
she
read
a
few
lines
then
threw
the
thing
on
to
the
table
that
kind
of
writing
sickens
me
she
exclaimed
with
anger
in
her
eyes
only
base
and
heartless
people
can
write
in
that
way
you
surely
won
t
let
it
trouble
you
oh
not
for
a
moment
her
father
answered
with
exaggerated
show
of
calm
but
i
am
surprised
that
you
don
t
see
the
literary
merit
of
the
work
i
thought
it
would
distinctly
appeal
to
there
was
a
strangeness
in
his
voice
as
well
as
in
the
words
which
caused
her
to
look
at
him
inquiringly
she
knew
him
well
enough
to
understand
that
such
a
notice
would
irritate
him
profoundly
but
why
should
he
go
out
of
his
way
to
show
it
her
and
with
this
peculiar
acerbity
of
manner
why
do
you
say
that
father
it
doesn
t
occur
to
you
who
may
probably
have
written
it
she
could
not
miss
his
meaning
astonishment
held
her
mute
for
a
moment
then
she
said
surely
mr
fadge
wrote
it
himself
i
am
told
not
i
am
informed
on
very
good
authority
that
one
of
his
young
gentlemen
has
the
credit
of
you
refer
of
course
to
mr
milvain
she
replied
quietly
but
i
think
that
can
t
be
he
looked
keenly
at
her
he
had
expected
a
more
decided
protest
i
see
no
reason
for
disbelieving
i
see
every
reason
until
i
have
your
this
was
not
at
all
marian
s
natural
tone
in
argument
with
him
she
was
wont
to
be
submissive
i
was
told
he
continued
hardening
face
and
voice
by
someone
who
had
it
from
yule
was
conscious
of
untruth
in
this
statement
but
his
mood
would
not
allow
him
to
speak
ingenuously
and
he
wished
to
note
the
effect
upon
marian
of
what
he
said
there
were
two
beliefs
in
him
on
the
one
hand
he
recognised
fadge
in
every
line
of
the
writing
on
the
other
he
had
a
perverse
satisfaction
in
convincing
himself
that
it
was
milvain
who
had
caught
so
successfully
the
master
s
manner
he
was
not
the
kind
of
man
who
can
resist
an
opportunity
of
justifying
to
himself
and
others
a
course
into
which
he
has
been
led
by
mingled
feelings
all
more
or
less
unjustifiable
how
should
jedwood
know
asked
marian
yule
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
if
these
things
didn
t
get
about
among
editors
and
publishers
in
this
case
there
s
a
and
why
pray
his
voice
trembled
with
choler
why
need
there
be
a
mistake
because
mr
milvain
is
quite
incapable
of
reviewing
your
book
in
such
a
there
is
your
mistake
my
girl
milvain
will
do
anything
that
s
asked
of
him
provided
he
s
well
enough
marian
reflected
when
she
raised
her
eyes
again
they
were
perfectly
calm
what
has
led
you
to
think
that
don
t
i
know
the
type
of
man
noscitur
ex
sociis
have
you
latin
enough
for
that
you
ll
find
that
you
are
misinformed
marian
replied
and
therewith
went
from
the
room
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
converse
longer
a
resentment
such
as
her
father
had
never
yet
excited
in
her
such
indeed
as
she
had
seldom
if
ever
conceived
threatened
to
force
utterance
for
itself
in
words
which
would
change
the
current
of
her
whole
life
she
saw
her
father
in
his
worst
aspect
and
her
heart
was
shaken
by
an
unnatural
revolt
from
him
let
his
assurance
of
what
he
reported
be
ever
so
firm
what
right
had
he
to
make
this
use
of
it
his
behaviour
was
spiteful
suppose
he
entertained
suspicions
which
seemed
to
make
it
his
duty
to
warn
her
against
milvain
this
was
not
the
way
to
go
about
it
a
father
actuated
by
simple
motives
of
affection
would
never
speak
and
look
thus
it
was
the
hateful
spirit
of
literary
rancour
that
ruled
him
the
spirit
that
made
people
eager
to
believe
all
evil
that
blinded
and
maddened
never
had
she
felt
so
strongly
the
unworthiness
of
the
existence
to
which
she
was
condemned
that
contemptible
review
and
now
her
father
s
ignoble
passion
such
things
were
enough
to
make
all
literature
appear
a
morbid
excrescence
upon
human
life
forgetful
of
the
time
she
sat
in
her
bedroom
until
a
knock
at
the
door
and
her
mother
s
voice
admonished
her
that
dinner
was
waiting
an
impulse
all
but
caused
her
to
say
that
she
would
rather
not
go
down
for
the
meal
that
she
wished
to
be
left
alone
but
this
would
be
weak
peevishness
she
just
looked
at
the
glass
to
see
that
her
face
bore
no
unwonted
signs
and
descended
to
take
her
place
as
usual
throughout
the
dinner
there
passed
no
word
of
conversation
yule
was
at
his
blackest
he
gobbled
a
few
mouthfuls
then
occupied
himself
with
the
evening
paper
on
rising
he
said
to
marian
have
you
copied
the
whole
of
that
the
tone
would
have
been
uncivil
if
addressed
to
an
impertinent
servant
not
much
more
than
half
was
the
cold
reply
can
you
finish
it
i
m
afraid
not
i
am
going
then
i
must
do
it
myself
and
he
went
to
the
study
mrs
yule
was
in
an
anguish
of
nervousness
what
is
it
dear
she
asked
of
marian
in
a
pleading
whisper
oh
don
t
quarrel
with
your
father
don
t
i
can
t
be
a
slave
mother
and
i
can
t
be
treated
what
is
it
let
me
go
and
speak
to
it
s
no
use
we
can
t
live
in
for
mrs
yule
this
was
unimaginable
disaster
she
had
never
dreamt
that
marian
the
still
gentle
marian
could
be
driven
to
revolt
and
it
had
come
with
the
suddenness
of
a
thunderclap
she
wished
to
ask
what
had
taken
place
between
father
and
daughter
in
the
brief
interview
before
dinner
but
marian
gave
her
no
chance
quitting
the
room
upon
those
last
trembling
words
the
girl
had
resolved
to
visit
her
friends
the
sisters
and
tell
them
that
in
future
they
must
never
come
to
see
her
at
home
but
it
was
no
easy
thing
for
her
to
stifle
her
conscience
and
leave
her
father
to
toil
over
that
copying
which
had
need
of
being
finished
not
her
will
but
her
exasperated
feeling
had
replied
to
him
that
she
would
not
do
the
work
already
it
astonished
her
that
she
had
really
spoken
such
words
and
as
the
throbbing
of
her
pulses
subsided
she
saw
more
clearly
into
the
motives
of
this
wretched
tumult
which
possessed
her
her
mind
was
harassed
with
a
fear
lest
in
defending
milvain
she
had
spoken
foolishly
had
he
not
himself
said
to
her
that
he
might
be
guilty
of
base
things
just
to
make
his
way
perhaps
it
was
the
intolerable
pain
of
imagining
that
he
had
already
made
good
his
words
which
robbed
her
of
and
made
her
meet
her
father
s
rudeness
with
defiance
impossible
to
carry
out
her
purpose
she
could
not
deliberately
leave
the
house
and
spend
some
hours
away
with
the
thought
of
such
wrath
and
misery
left
behind
her
gradually
she
was
returning
to
her
natural
self
fear
and
penitence
were
chill
at
her
heart
she
went
down
to
the
study
tapped
and
entered
father
i
said
something
that
i
did
not
really
mean
of
course
i
shall
go
on
with
the
copying
and
finish
it
as
soon
as
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
my
he
was
in
his
usual
place
already
working
at
marian
s
task
he
spoke
in
a
low
thick
voice
spend
your
evening
as
you
choose
i
have
no
need
of
i
behaved
very
forgive
me
have
the
goodness
to
go
away
you
hear
me
his
eyes
were
inflamed
and
his
discoloured
teeth
showed
themselves
savagely
marian
durst
not
really
durst
not
approach
him
she
hesitated
but
once
more
a
sense
of
hateful
injustice
moved
within
her
and
she
went
away
as
quietly
as
she
had
entered
she
said
to
herself
that
now
it
was
her
perfect
right
to
go
whither
she
would
but
the
freedom
was
only
in
theory
her
submissive
and
timid
nature
kept
her
at
home
and
upstairs
in
her
own
room
for
if
she
went
to
sit
with
her
mother
of
necessity
she
must
talk
about
what
had
happened
and
that
she
felt
unable
to
do
some
friend
to
whom
she
could
unbosom
all
her
sufferings
would
now
have
been
very
precious
to
her
but
maud
and
dora
were
her
only
intimates
and
to
them
she
might
not
make
the
full
confession
which
gives
solace
mrs
yule
did
not
venture
to
intrude
upon
her
daughter
s
privacy
that
marian
neither
went
out
nor
showed
herself
in
the
house
proved
her
troubled
state
but
the
mother
had
no
confidence
in
her
power
to
comfort
at
the
usual
time
she
presented
herself
in
the
study
with
her
husband
s
coffee
the
face
which
was
for
an
instant
turned
to
her
did
not
invite
conversation
but
distress
obliged
her
to
speak
why
are
you
cross
with
marian
alfred
you
had
better
ask
what
she
means
by
her
extraordinary
a
word
of
harsh
rebuff
was
the
most
she
had
expected
thus
encouraged
she
timidly
put
another
question
how
has
she
behaved
i
suppose
you
have
ears
but
wasn
t
there
something
before
that
you
spoke
so
angry
to
spoke
so
angry
did
i
she
is
out
i
suppose
no
she
hasn
t
gone
that
ll
do
don
t
disturb
me
any
she
did
not
venture
to
linger
the
breakfast
next
morning
seemed
likely
to
pass
without
any
interchange
of
words
but
when
yule
was
pushing
back
his
chair
marian
who
looked
pale
and
ill
addressed
a
question
to
him
about
the
work
she
would
ordinarily
have
pursued
at
the
he
answered
in
a
tone
and
for
a
few
minutes
they
talked
on
the
subject
much
as
at
any
other
time
half
an
hour
after
marian
set
forth
for
the
museum
in
the
usual
way
her
father
stayed
at
home
it
was
the
end
of
the
episode
for
the
present
marian
felt
that
the
best
thing
would
be
to
ignore
what
had
happened
as
her
father
evidently
purposed
doing
she
had
asked
his
forgiveness
and
it
was
harsh
in
him
to
have
repelled
her
but
by
now
she
was
able
once
more
to
take
into
consideration
all
his
trials
and
toils
his
embittered
temper
and
the
new
wound
he
had
received
that
he
should
resume
his
wonted
manner
was
sufficient
evidence
of
regret
on
his
part
gladly
she
would
have
unsaid
her
resentful
words
she
had
been
guilty
of
a
childish
outburst
of
temper
and
perhaps
had
prepared
worse
sufferings
for
the
future
and
yet
perhaps
it
was
as
well
that
her
father
should
be
warned
she
was
not
all
submission
he
might
try
her
beyond
endurance
there
might
come
a
day
when
perforce
she
must
stand
face
to
face
with
him
and
make
it
known
she
had
her
own
claims
upon
life
it
was
as
well
he
should
hold
that
possibility
in
view
this
evening
no
work
was
expected
of
her
not
long
after
dinner
she
prepared
for
going
out
to
her
mother
she
mentioned
she
should
be
back
about
ten
o
clock
give
my
kind
regards
to
them
dear
if
you
like
to
said
mrs
yule
just
above
her
breath
certainly
i

recruits
marian
walked
to
the
nearest
point
of
camden
road
and
there
waited
for
an
omnibus
which
conveyed
her
to
within
easy
reach
of
the
street
where
maud
and
dora
milvain
had
their
lodgings
this
was
at
the
of
regent
s
park
and
no
great
distance
from
mornington
road
where
jasper
still
dwelt
on
learning
that
the
young
ladies
were
at
home
and
alone
she
ascended
to
the
second
floor
and
knocked
that
s
right
exclaimed
dora
s
pleasant
voice
as
the
door
opened
and
the
visitor
showed
herself
and
then
came
the
friendly
greeting
which
warmed
marian
s
heart
the
greeting
which
until
lately
no
house
in
london
could
afford
her
the
girls
looked
oddly
out
of
place
in
this
with
its
vulgar
furniture
and
paltry
ornaments
maud
especially
so
for
her
fine
figure
was
well
displayed
by
the
dress
of
mourning
and
her
pale
handsome
face
had
as
little
congruence
as
possible
with
a
background
of
humble
circumstances
dora
impressed
one
as
a
simpler
nature
but
she
too
had
distinctly
the
note
of
refinement
which
was
out
of
harmony
with
these
surroundings
they
occupied
only
two
rooms
the
being
they
purchased
food
for
themselves
and
prepared
their
own
meals
excepting
dinner
during
the
first
week
a
good
many
tears
were
shed
by
both
of
them
it
was
not
easy
to
transfer
themselves
from
the
comfortable
country
home
to
this
bare
corner
of
lodgers
london
maud
as
appeared
at
the
first
glance
was
less
disposed
than
her
sister
to
make
the
best
of
things
her
countenance
wore
an
expression
rather
of
discontent
than
of
sorrow
and
she
did
not
talk
with
the
same
readiness
as
dora
on
the
round
table
lay
a
number
of
books
when
disturbed
the
sisters
had
been
engaged
in
studious
reading
i
m
not
sure
that
i
do
right
in
coming
again
so
soon
said
marian
as
she
took
off
her
things
your
time
is
so
are
you
replied
dora
laughing
it
s
only
under
protest
that
we
work
in
the
evening
when
we
have
been
hard
at
it
all
we
have
news
for
you
too
said
maud
who
sat
languidly
on
an
uneasy
chair
good
i
hope
someone
called
to
see
us
yesterday
i
dare
say
you
can
guess
who
it
amy
perhaps
and
how
did
you
like
her
the
sisters
seemed
to
have
a
difficulty
in
answering
dora
was
the
first
to
speak
we
thought
she
was
sadly
out
of
spirits
indeed
she
told
us
that
she
hasn
t
been
very
well
lately
but
i
think
we
shall
like
her
if
we
come
to
know
her
it
was
rather
awkward
marian
the
elder
sister
explained
we
felt
obliged
to
say
something
about
mr
reardon
s
books
but
we
haven
t
read
any
of
them
yet
you
know
so
i
just
said
that
i
hoped
soon
to
read
his
new
novel
i
suppose
you
have
seen
reviews
of
it
she
asked
at
once
of
course
i
ought
to
have
had
the
courage
to
say
no
but
i
admitted
that
i
had
seen
one
or
two
jasper
showed
us
them
she
looked
very
much
annoyed
and
after
that
we
didn
t
find
much
to
talk
the
reviews
are
very
disagreeable
said
marian
with
a
troubled
face
i
have
read
the
book
since
i
saw
you
the
other
day
and
i
am
afraid
it
isn
t
good
but
i
have
seen
many
worse
novels
more
kindly
jasper
says
it
s
because
mr
reardon
has
no
friends
among
the
still
replied
marian
i
m
afraid
they
couldn
t
have
given
the
book
much
praise
if
they
wrote
honestly
did
amy
ask
you
to
go
and
see
her
yes
but
she
said
it
was
uncertain
how
long
they
would
be
living
at
their
present
address
and
really
we
can
t
feel
sure
whether
we
should
be
welcome
or
not
just
marian
listened
with
bent
head
she
too
had
to
make
known
to
her
friends
that
they
were
not
welcome
in
her
own
home
but
she
knew
not
how
to
utter
words
which
would
sound
so
unkind
your
brother
she
said
after
a
pause
will
soon
find
suitable
friends
for
before
long
replied
dora
with
a
look
of
amusement
he
s
going
to
take
us
to
call
on
mrs
boston
wright
i
hardly
thought
he
was
serious
at
first
but
he
says
he
really
means
marian
grew
more
and
more
silent
at
home
she
had
felt
that
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
explain
her
troubles
to
these
sympathetic
girls
but
now
the
time
had
come
for
speaking
she
was
oppressed
by
shame
and
anxiety
true
there
was
no
absolute
necessity
for
making
the
confession
this
evening
and
if
she
chose
to
resist
her
father
s
prejudice
things
might
even
go
on
in
a
seemingly
natural
way
but
the
loneliness
of
her
life
had
developed
in
her
a
sensitiveness
which
could
not
endure
situations
such
as
the
present
difficulties
which
are
of
small
account
to
people
who
take
their
part
in
active
social
life
harassed
her
to
the
destruction
of
all
peace
dora
was
not
long
in
noticing
the
dejected
mood
which
had
come
upon
her
friend
what
s
troubling
you
marian
something
i
can
hardly
bear
to
speak
of
perhaps
it
will
be
the
end
of
your
friendship
for
me
and
i
should
find
it
very
hard
to
go
back
to
my
old
the
girls
gazed
at
her
in
doubt
at
first
whether
she
spoke
seriously
what
can
you
mean
dora
exclaimed
what
crime
have
you
been
committing
maud
who
leaned
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
searched
marian
s
face
curiously
but
said
nothing
has
mr
milvain
shown
you
the
new
number
of
the
current
marian
went
on
to
ask
they
replied
with
a
negative
and
maud
added
he
has
nothing
in
it
this
month
except
a
a
review
repeated
marian
in
a
low
voice
yes
of
somebody
s
markland
s
supplied
dora
marian
drew
a
breath
but
remained
for
a
moment
with
her
eyes
cast
down
do
go
on
dear
urged
dora
whatever
are
you
going
to
tell
us
there
s
a
notice
of
father
s
book
continued
the
other
a
very
one
it
s
written
by
the
editor
mr
fadge
father
and
he
have
been
very
unfriendly
for
a
long
time
perhaps
mr
milvain
has
told
you
something
about
it
dora
replied
that
he
had
i
don
t
know
how
it
is
in
other
professions
marian
resumed
but
i
hope
there
is
less
envy
hatred
and
malice
than
in
this
of
ours
the
name
of
literature
is
often
made
hateful
to
me
by
the
things
i
hear
and
read
my
father
has
never
been
very
fortunate
and
many
things
have
happened
to
make
him
bitter
against
the
men
who
succeed
he
has
often
quarrelled
with
people
who
were
at
first
his
friends
but
never
so
seriously
with
anyone
as
with
mr
fadge
his
feeling
of
enmity
goes
so
far
that
it
includes
even
those
who
are
in
any
way
associated
with
mr
fadge
i
am
sorry
to
say
she
looked
with
painful
anxiety
from
one
to
the
other
of
her
hearers
this
has
turned
him
against
your
brother
and
her
voice
was
checked
by
agitation
we
were
afraid
of
this
said
dora
in
a
tone
of
sympathy
jasper
feared
it
might
be
the
case
added
maud
more
coldly
though
with
friendliness
why
i
speak
of
it
at
all
marian
hastened
to
say
is
because
i
am
so
afraid
it
should
make
a
difference
between
yourselves
and
oh
don
t
think
that
dora
exclaimed
i
am
so
ashamed
marian
went
on
in
an
uncertain
tone
but
i
think
it
will
be
better
if
i
don
t
ask
you
to
come
and
see
me
it
sounds
ridiculous
it
is
ridiculous
and
shameful
i
couldn
t
complain
if
you
refused
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
don
t
let
it
trouble
you
urged
maud
with
perhaps
a
trifle
more
of
magnanimity
in
her
voice
than
was
needful
we
quite
understand
indeed
it
shan
t
make
any
difference
to
but
marian
had
averted
her
face
and
could
not
meet
these
assurances
with
any
show
of
pleasure
now
that
the
step
was
taken
she
felt
that
her
behaviour
had
been
very
weak
unreasonable
harshness
such
as
her
father
s
ought
to
have
been
met
more
steadily
she
had
no
right
to
make
it
an
excuse
for
such
incivility
to
her
friends
yet
only
in
some
such
way
as
this
could
she
make
known
to
jasper
milvain
how
her
father
regarded
him
which
she
felt
it
necessary
to
do
now
his
sisters
would
tell
him
and
henceforth
there
would
be
a
clear
understanding
on
both
sides
that
state
of
things
was
painful
to
her
but
it
was
better
than
ambiguous
relations
jasper
is
very
sorry
about
it
said
dora
glancing
rapidly
at
marian
but
his
connection
with
mr
fadge
came
about
in
such
a
natural
way
added
the
eldest
sister
and
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
refuse
impossible
i
know
marian
replied
earnestly
don
t
think
that
i
wish
to
justify
my
father
but
i
can
understand
him
and
it
must
be
very
difficult
for
you
to
do
so
you
can
t
know
as
i
do
how
intensely
he
has
suffered
in
these
wretched
ignoble
quarrels
if
only
you
will
let
me
come
here
still
in
the
same
way
and
still
be
as
friendly
to
me
my
home
has
never
been
a
place
to
which
i
could
have
invited
friends
with
any
comfort
even
if
i
had
had
any
to
invite
there
were
always
reasons
but
i
can
t
speak
of
my
dear
marian
appealed
dora
don
t
distress
yourself
so
do
believe
that
nothing
whatever
has
happened
to
change
our
feeling
to
you
has
there
maud
nothing
whatever
we
are
not
unreasonable
girls
i
am
more
grateful
to
you
than
i
can
it
had
seemed
as
if
marian
must
give
way
to
the
emotions
which
all
but
choked
her
voice
she
overcame
them
however
and
presently
was
able
to
talk
in
pretty
much
her
usual
way
though
when
she
smiled
it
was
but
faintly
maud
tried
to
lead
her
thoughts
in
another
direction
by
speaking
of
work
in
which
she
and
dora
were
engaged
already
the
sisters
were
doing
a
new
piece
of
compilation
for
messrs
jolly
and
monk
it
was
more
exacting
than
their
initial
task
for
the
book
market
and
would
take
a
much
longer
time
a
couple
of
hours
went
by
and
marian
had
just
spoken
of
taking
her
leave
when
a
man
s
step
was
heard
rapidly
ascending
the
nearest
flight
of
stairs
here
s
jasper
remarked
dora
and
in
a
moment
there
sounded
a
short
sharp
summons
at
the
door
jasper
it
was
he
came
in
with
radiant
face
his
eyes
blinking
before
the
lamplight
well
girls
ha
how
do
you
do
miss
yule
i
had
just
the
vaguest
sort
of
expectation
that
you
might
be
here
it
seemed
a
likely
night
i
don
t
know
why
i
say
dora
we
really
must
get
two
or
three
decent
for
your
room
i
ve
seen
some
outside
a
furniture
shop
in
hampstead
road
about
six
shillings
apiece
there
s
no
sitting
on
chairs
such
as
that
on
which
he
tried
to
dispose
himself
when
he
had
flung
aside
his
trappings
creaked
and
shivered
ominously
you
hear
i
shall
come
plump
on
to
the
floor
if
i
don
t
mind
my
word
what
a
day
i
have
had
i
ve
just
been
trying
what
i
really
could
do
in
one
day
if
i
worked
my
hardest
now
just
listen
it
deserves
to
be
chronicled
for
the
encouragement
of
aspiring
youth
i
got
up
at
and
whilst
i
breakfasted
i
read
through
a
volume
i
had
to
review
by
the
review
was
written
of
a
column
of
the
evening
who
is
the
unfortunate
author
interrupted
maud
caustically
not
unfortunate
at
all
i
had
to
crack
him
up
otherwise
i
couldn
t
have
done
the
job
so
quickly
it
s
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
write
laudation
only
an
inexperienced
grumbler
would
declare
it
was
easier
to
find
fault
the
book
was
billington
s
vagaries
pompous
idiocy
of
course
but
he
lives
in
a
big
house
and
gives
dinners
well
from
to
i
smoked
a
cigar
and
reflected
feeling
that
the
day
wasn
t
badly
begun
at
eleven
i
was
ready
to
write
my
saturday
causerie
for
the
will
o
the
wisp
it
took
me
till
close
upon
one
o
clock
which
was
rather
too
long
i
can
t
afford
more
than
an
hour
and
a
half
for
that
job
at
one
i
rushed
out
to
a
dirty
little
in
hampstead
road
was
back
again
by
a
quarter
to
two
having
in
the
meantime
sketched
a
paper
for
the
west
end
pipe
in
mouth
i
sat
down
to
leisurely
artistic
work
by
five
half
the
paper
was
done
the
other
half
remains
for
from
five
to
i
read
four
newspapers
and
two
magazines
and
from
to
a
quarter
to
six
i
jotted
down
several
ideas
that
had
come
to
me
whilst
reading
at
six
i
was
again
in
the
dirty
satisfying
a
ferocious
hunger
home
once
more
at
and
for
two
hours
wrote
steadily
at
a
long
affair
i
have
in
hand
for
the
current
then
i
came
here
thinking
hard
all
the
way
what
say
you
to
this
have
i
earned
a
night
s
repose
and
what
s
the
value
of
it
all
asked
maud
probably
from
ten
to
twelve
guineas
if
i
i
meant
what
was
the
literary
value
of
it
said
his
sister
with
a
smile
equal
to
that
of
the
contents
of
a
mouldy
pretty
much
what
i
oh
but
it
answers
the
purpose
urged
dora
and
it
does
no
one
any
honest
cried
jasper
there
are
few
men
in
london
capable
of
such
a
feat
many
a
fellow
could
write
more
in
quantity
but
they
couldn
t
command
my
market
it
s
rubbish
but
rubbish
of
a
very
special
kind
of
fine
marian
had
not
yet
spoken
save
a
word
or
two
in
reply
to
jasper
s
greeting
now
and
then
she
just
glanced
at
him
but
for
the
most
part
her
eyes
were
cast
down
now
jasper
addressed
her
a
year
ago
miss
yule
i
shouldn
t
have
believed
myself
capable
of
such
activity
in
fact
i
wasn
t
capable
of
it
you
think
such
work
won
t
be
too
great
a
strain
upon
you
she
asked
oh
this
isn
t
a
specimen
day
you
know
i
shall
very
likely
do
nothing
but
finish
my
west
end
article
in
an
easy
two
or
three
hours
there
s
no
knowing
i
might
perhaps
keep
up
the
high
pressure
if
i
tried
but
then
i
couldn
t
dispose
of
all
the
work
little
by
little
or
perhaps
rather
quicker
than
that
i
shall
extend
my
scope
for
instance
i
should
like
to
do
two
or
three
leaders
a
week
for
one
of
the
big
dailies
i
can
t
attain
unto
that
just
not
political
leaders
by
no
means
that
s
not
my
line
the
kind
of
thing
in
which
one
makes
a
column
out
of
what
would
fill
six
lines
of
respectable
prose
you
call
a
cigar
a
convoluted
weed
and
so
on
you
know
that
passes
for
facetiousness
i
ve
never
really
tried
my
hand
at
that
style
yet
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
i
managed
it
brilliantly
some
day
i
ll
write
a
few
exercises
just
take
two
lines
of
some
good
prose
writer
and
expand
them
into
twenty
in
different
ways
excellent
mental
gymnastics
marian
listened
to
his
flow
of
talk
for
a
few
minutes
longer
then
took
the
opportunity
of
a
brief
silence
to
rise
and
put
on
her
hat
jasper
observed
her
but
without
rising
he
looked
at
his
sisters
in
a
hesitating
way
at
length
he
stood
up
and
declared
that
he
too
must
be
off
this
coincidence
had
happened
once
before
when
he
met
marian
here
in
the
evening
at
all
events
you
won
t
do
any
more
work
said
dora
no
i
shall
read
a
page
of
something
or
other
over
a
glass
of
whisky
and
seek
the
sleep
of
a
man
who
has
done
his
why
the
whisky
asked
maud
do
you
grudge
me
such
poor
solace
i
don
t
see
the
need
of
nonsense
maud
exclaimed
her
sister
he
needs
a
little
stimulant
when
he
works
so
each
of
the
girls
gave
marian
s
hand
a
significant
pressure
as
she
took
leave
of
them
and
begged
her
to
come
again
as
soon
as
she
had
a
free
evening
there
was
gratitude
in
her
eyes
the
evening
was
clear
and
not
very
cold
it
s
rather
late
for
you
to
go
home
said
jasper
as
they
left
the
house
may
i
walk
part
of
the
way
with
you
marian
replied
with
a
low
thank
i
think
you
get
on
pretty
well
with
the
girls
don
t
you
i
hope
they
are
as
glad
of
my
friendship
as
i
am
of
pity
to
see
them
in
a
place
like
that
isn
t
it
they
ought
to
have
a
good
house
with
plenty
of
servants
it
s
bad
enough
for
a
civilised
man
to
have
to
rough
it
but
i
hate
to
see
women
living
in
a
sordid
way
don
t
you
think
they
could
both
play
their
part
in
a
with
a
little
experience
surely
there
s
no
doubt
of
maud
would
look
really
superb
if
she
were
handsomely
dressed
she
hasn
t
a
common
face
by
any
means
and
dora
is
pretty
i
think
well
they
shall
go
and
see
some
people
before
long
the
difficulty
is
one
doesn
t
like
it
to
be
known
that
they
live
in
such
a
crib
but
i
daren
t
advise
them
to
go
in
for
expense
one
can
t
be
sure
that
it
would
repay
them
though
now
in
my
own
case
if
i
could
get
hold
of
a
few
thousand
pounds
i
should
know
how
to
use
it
with
the
certainty
of
return
it
would
save
me
probably
a
clear
ten
years
of
life
i
mean
i
should
go
at
a
jump
to
what
i
shall
be
ten
years
hence
without
the
help
of
money
but
they
have
such
a
miserable
little
bit
of
capital
and
everything
is
still
so
uncertain
one
daren
t
speculate
under
the
marian
made
no
reply
you
think
i
talk
of
nothing
but
money
jasper
said
suddenly
looking
down
into
her
face
i
know
too
well
what
it
means
to
be
without
yes
but
you
do
just
a
little
despise
me
indeed
i
don
t
mr
if
that
is
sincere
i
m
very
glad
i
take
it
in
a
friendly
sense
i
am
rather
despicable
you
know
it
s
part
of
my
business
to
be
so
but
a
friend
needn
t
regard
that
there
is
the
man
apart
from
his
the
silence
was
then
unbroken
till
they
came
to
the
lower
end
of
park
street
the
junction
of
roads
which
lead
to
hampstead
to
highgate
and
to
holloway
shall
you
take
an
omnibus
jasper
asked
she
hesitated
or
will
you
give
me
the
pleasure
of
walking
on
with
you
you
are
tired
perhaps
not
the
for
the
rest
of
her
answer
she
moved
forward
and
they
crossed
into
the
obscurity
of
camden
road
shall
i
be
doing
wrong
mr
milvain
marian
began
in
a
very
low
voice
if
i
ask
you
about
the
authorship
of
something
in
this
month
s
current
i
m
afraid
i
know
what
you
refer
to
there
s
no
reason
why
i
shouldn
t
answer
a
question
of
the
it
was
mr
fadge
himself
who
reviewed
my
father
s
book
it
was
confound
him
i
don
t
know
another
man
who
could
have
done
the
thing
so
vilely
i
suppose
he
was
only
replying
to
my
father
s
attack
upon
him
and
his
your
father
s
attack
is
honest
and
straightforward
and
justifiable
and
well
put
i
read
that
chapter
of
his
book
with
huge
satisfaction
but
has
anyone
suggested
that
another
than
fadge
was
capable
of
that
masterpiece
yes
i
am
told
that
mr
jedwood
the
publisher
has
somehow
made
a
jedwood
and
what
mistake
father
heard
that
you
were
the
i
jasper
stopped
short
they
were
in
the
rays
of
a
and
could
see
each
other
s
faces
and
he
believes
that
i
m
afraid
and
you
believe
believed
it
not
for
a
i
shall
write
a
note
to
mr
marian
was
silent
a
while
then
said
wouldn
t
it
be
better
if
you
found
a
way
of
letting
mr
jedwood
know
the
truth
perhaps
you
are
jasper
was
very
grateful
for
the
suggestion
in
that
moment
he
had
reflected
how
rash
it
would
be
to
write
to
alfred
yule
on
such
a
subject
with
whatever
prudence
in
expressing
himself
such
a
letter
coming
under
the
notice
of
the
great
fadge
might
do
its
writer
serious
harm
yes
you
are
right
he
repeated
i
ll
stop
that
rumour
at
its
source
i
can
t
guess
how
it
started
for
aught
i
know
some
enemy
hath
done
this
though
i
don
t
quite
discern
the
motive
thank
you
very
much
for
telling
me
and
still
more
for
refusing
to
believe
that
i
could
treat
mr
yule
in
that
way
even
as
a
matter
of
business
when
i
said
that
i
was
despicable
i
didn
t
mean
that
i
could
sink
quite
to
such
a
point
as
that
if
only
because
it
was
your
father
he
checked
himself
and
they
walked
on
for
several
yards
without
speaking
in
that
case
jasper
resumed
at
length
your
father
doesn
t
think
of
me
in
a
very
friendly
way
he
scarcely
could
no
no
and
i
quite
understand
that
the
mere
fact
of
my
working
for
fadge
would
prejudice
him
against
me
but
that
s
no
reason
i
hope
why
you
and
i
shouldn
t
be
friends
i
hope
i
don
t
know
that
my
friendship
is
worth
much
jasper
continued
talking
into
the
upper
air
a
habit
of
his
when
he
discussed
his
own
character
i
shall
go
on
as
i
have
begun
and
fight
for
some
of
the
good
things
of
life
but
your
friendship
is
valuable
if
i
am
sure
of
it
i
shall
be
at
all
events
within
sight
of
the
better
marian
walked
on
with
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
to
her
surprise
she
discovered
presently
that
they
had
all
but
reached
st
paul
s
crescent
thank
you
for
having
come
so
far
she
said
pausing
ah
you
are
nearly
home
why
it
seems
only
a
few
minutes
since
we
left
the
girls
now
i
ll
run
back
to
the
whisky
of
which
maud
may
it
do
you
good
said
marian
with
a
laugh
a
speech
of
this
kind
seemed
unusual
upon
her
lips
jasper
smiled
as
he
held
her
hand
and
regarded
her
then
you
can
speak
in
a
joking
way
do
i
seem
so
very
dull
dull
by
no
means
but
sage
and
sober
and
reticent
and
exactly
what
i
like
in
my
friend
because
it
contrasts
with
my
own
habits
all
the
better
that
merriment
lies
below
it
goodnight
miss
he
strode
off
and
in
a
minute
or
two
turned
his
head
to
look
at
the
slight
figure
passing
into
darkness
marian
s
hand
trembled
as
she
tried
to
insert
her
when
she
had
closed
the
door
very
quietly
behind
her
she
went
to
the
mrs
yule
was
just
laying
aside
the
sewing
on
which
she
had
occupied
herself
throughout
the
lonely
evening
i
m
rather
late
said
the
girl
in
a
voice
of
subdued
joyousness
yes
i
was
getting
a
little
uneasy
oh
there
s
no
you
have
been
enjoying
yourself
i
can
i
have
had
a
pleasant
in
the
retrospect
it
seemed
the
pleasantest
she
had
yet
spent
with
her
friends
though
she
had
set
out
in
such
a
different
mood
her
mind
was
relieved
of
two
anxieties
she
felt
sure
that
the
girls
had
not
taken
ill
what
she
told
them
and
there
was
no
longer
the
least
doubt
concerning
the
authorship
of
that
review
in
the
current
she
could
confess
to
herself
now
that
the
assurance
from
jasper
s
lips
was
not
superfluous
he
might
have
weighed
profit
against
other
considerations
and
have
written
in
that
way
of
her
father
she
had
not
felt
that
absolute
confidence
which
defies
every
argument
from
human
frailty
and
now
she
asked
herself
if
faith
of
that
unassailable
kind
is
ever
possible
is
it
not
only
the
poet
s
dream
the
far
ideal
marian
often
went
thus
far
in
her
speculation
her
candour
was
allied
with
clear
insight
into
the
possibilities
of
falsehood
she
was
not
readily
the
victim
of
illusion
thinking
much
and
speaking
little
she
had
not
come
to
her
year
without
perceiving
what
a
distance
lay
between
a
girl
s
dream
of
life
as
it
might
be
and
life
as
it
is
had
she
invariably
disclosed
her
thoughts
she
would
have
earned
the
repute
of
a
very
sceptical
and
slightly
cynical
person
but
with
what
rapturous
tumult
of
the
heart
she
could
abandon
herself
to
a
belief
in
human
virtues
when
their
suggestion
seemed
to
promise
her
a
future
of
happiness
alone
in
her
room
she
sat
down
only
to
think
of
jasper
milvain
and
extract
from
the
memory
of
his
words
his
looks
new
sustenance
for
her
hungry
heart
jasper
was
the
first
man
who
had
ever
evinced
a
man
s
interest
in
her
until
she
met
him
she
had
not
known
a
look
of
compliment
or
a
word
addressed
to
her
emotions
he
was
as
far
as
possible
from
representing
the
lover
of
her
imagination
but
from
the
day
of
that
long
talk
in
the
fields
near
wattleborough
the
thought
of
him
had
supplanted
dreams
on
that
day
she
said
to
herself
i
could
love
him
if
he
cared
to
seek
my
love
premature
perhaps
why
yes
but
one
who
is
starving
is
not
wont
to
feel
reluctance
at
the
suggestion
of
food
the
first
man
who
had
approached
her
with
display
of
feeling
and
energy
and
youthful
handsome
too
it
seemed
to
her
her
womanhood
went
eagerly
to
meet
him
since
then
she
had
made
careful
study
of
his
faults
each
conversation
had
revealed
to
her
new
weakness
and
follies
with
the
result
that
her
love
had
grown
to
a
reality
he
was
so
human
and
a
youth
of
all
but
monastic
seclusion
had
prepared
her
to
love
the
man
who
aimed
with
frank
energy
at
the
joys
of
life
a
taint
of
pedantry
would
have
repelled
her
she
did
not
ask
for
high
intellect
or
great
attainments
but
vivacity
courage
determination
to
succeed
were
delightful
to
her
senses
her
ideal
would
not
have
been
a
literary
man
at
all
certainly
not
a
man
likely
to
be
prominent
in
journalism
rather
a
man
of
action
one
who
had
no
restraints
of
commerce
or
official
routine
but
in
jasper
she
saw
the
qualities
that
attracted
her
apart
from
the
accidents
of
his
position
ideal
personages
do
not
descend
to
girls
who
have
to
labour
at
the
british
museum
it
seemed
a
marvel
to
her
and
of
good
augury
that
even
such
a
man
as
jasper
should
have
crossed
her
path
it
was
as
though
years
had
passed
since
their
first
meeting
upon
her
return
to
london
had
followed
such
long
periods
of
hopelessness
yet
whenever
they
encountered
each
other
he
had
look
and
speech
for
her
with
which
surely
he
did
not
greet
every
woman
from
the
first
his
way
of
regarding
her
had
shown
frank
interest
and
at
length
had
come
the
confession
of
his
respect
his
desire
to
be
something
more
to
her
than
a
mere
acquaintance
it
was
scarcely
possible
that
he
should
speak
as
he
several
times
had
of
late
if
he
did
not
wish
to
draw
her
towards
him
that
was
the
hopeful
side
of
her
thoughts
it
was
easy
to
forget
for
a
time
those
words
of
his
which
one
might
think
were
spoken
as
distinct
warning
but
they
crept
into
the
memory
unwelcome
importunate
as
soon
as
imagination
had
built
its
palace
of
joy
why
did
he
always
recur
to
the
subject
of
money
i
shall
allow
nothing
to
come
in
my
way
he
once
said
that
as
if
meaning
certainly
not
a
love
affair
with
a
girl
who
is
he
emphasised
the
word
friend
as
if
to
explain
that
he
offered
and
asked
nothing
more
than
friendship
but
it
only
meant
that
he
would
not
be
in
haste
to
declare
himself
of
a
certainty
there
was
conflict
between
his
ambition
and
his
love
but
she
recognised
her
power
over
him
and
exulted
in
it
she
had
observed
his
hesitancy
this
evening
before
he
rose
to
accompany
her
from
the
house
her
heart
laughed
within
her
as
the
desire
drew
him
and
henceforth
such
meetings
would
be
frequent
with
each
one
her
influence
would
increase
how
kindly
fate
had
dealt
with
her
in
bringing
maud
and
dora
to
london
it
was
within
his
reach
to
marry
a
woman
who
would
bring
him
wealth
he
had
that
in
mind
she
understood
it
too
well
but
not
one
moment
s
advantage
would
she
relinquish
he
must
choose
her
in
her
poverty
and
be
content
with
what
his
talents
could
earn
for
him
her
love
gave
her
the
right
to
demand
this
sacrifice
let
him
ask
for
her
love
and
the
sacrifice
would
no
longer
seem
one
so
passionately
would
she
reward
him
he
would
ask
it
she
was
full
of
a
rich
confidence
partly
no
doubt
the
result
of
reaction
from
her
miseries
he
had
said
at
parting
that
her
character
was
so
well
suited
to
his
that
he
liked
her
and
then
he
had
pressed
her
hand
so
warmly
before
long
he
would
ask
her
love
the
unhoped
was
all
but
granted
her
she
could
labour
on
in
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
books
for
a
ray
of
dazzling
sunshine
might
at
any
moment
strike
into
its
musty
gloom
chapter
xv
the
last
resource
the
past
twelve
months
had
added
several
years
to
edwin
reardon
s
seeming
age
at
he
would
generally
have
been
taken
for
forty
his
bearing
his
personal
habits
were
no
longer
those
of
a
young
man
he
walked
with
a
stoop
and
pressed
noticeably
on
the
stick
he
carried
it
was
rare
for
him
to
show
the
countenance
which
tells
of
present
cheerfulness
or
glad
there
was
no
spring
in
his
step
his
voice
had
fallen
to
a
lower
key
and
often
he
spoke
with
that
hesitation
in
choice
of
words
which
may
be
noticed
in
persons
whom
defeat
has
made
ceaseless
perplexity
and
dread
gave
a
wandering
sometimes
a
wild
expression
to
his
eyes
he
seldom
slept
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
as
a
rule
he
was
conscious
all
through
the
night
of
a
kind
of
fighting
between
physical
weariness
and
wakeful
toil
of
the
mind
it
often
happened
that
some
wholly
imaginary
obstacle
in
the
story
he
was
writing
kept
him
under
a
sense
of
effort
throughout
the
dark
hours
now
and
again
he
woke
reasoned
with
himself
and
remembered
clearly
that
the
torment
was
without
cause
but
the
short
relief
thus
afforded
soon
passed
in
the
recollection
of
real
distress
in
his
unsoothing
slumber
he
talked
aloud
frequently
wakening
amy
generally
he
seemed
to
be
holding
a
dialogue
with
someone
who
had
imposed
an
intolerable
task
upon
him
he
protested
passionately
appealed
argued
in
the
strangest
way
about
the
injustice
of
what
was
demanded
once
amy
heard
him
begging
for
money
positively
begging
like
some
poor
wretch
in
the
street
it
was
horrible
and
made
her
shed
tears
when
he
asked
what
he
had
been
saying
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
tell
him
when
the
striking
clocks
summoned
him
remorselessly
to
rise
and
work
he
often
reeled
with
dizziness
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
greatest
happiness
attainable
would
be
to
creep
into
some
dark
warm
corner
out
of
the
sight
and
memory
of
men
and
lie
there
torpid
with
a
blessed
that
death
was
slowly
overcoming
him
of
all
the
sufferings
collected
into
each
hours
this
of
rising
to
a
new
day
was
the
worst
the
story
which
he
had
calculated
would
take
him
four
or
five
weeks
was
with
difficulty
finished
in
two
months
march
winds
made
an
invalid
of
him
at
one
time
he
was
threatened
with
bronchitis
and
for
several
days
had
to
abandon
even
the
effort
to
work
in
previous
winters
he
had
been
wont
to
undergo
a
good
deal
of
martyrdom
from
the
london
climate
but
never
in
such
a
degree
as
now
mental
illness
seemed
to
have
enfeebled
his
body
it
was
strange
that
he
succeeded
in
doing
work
of
any
kind
for
he
had
no
hope
from
the
result
this
one
last
effort
he
would
make
just
to
complete
the
undeniableness
of
his
failure
and
then
literature
should
be
thrown
behind
him
what
other
pursuit
was
possible
to
him
he
knew
not
but
perhaps
he
might
discover
some
mode
of
earning
a
livelihood
had
it
been
a
question
of
gaining
a
pound
a
week
as
in
the
old
days
he
might
have
hoped
to
obtain
some
clerkship
like
that
at
the
hospital
where
no
commercial
experience
or
aptitude
was
demanded
but
in
his
present
position
such
an
income
would
be
useless
could
he
take
amy
and
the
child
to
live
in
a
garret
on
less
than
a
hundred
a
year
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
maintain
outward
decency
already
his
own
clothing
began
to
declare
him
and
but
for
gifts
from
her
mother
amy
would
have
reached
the
like
pass
they
lived
in
dread
of
the
pettiest
casual
expense
for
the
day
of
pennilessness
was
again
approaching
amy
was
oftener
from
home
than
had
been
her
custom
occasionally
she
went
away
soon
after
breakfast
and
spent
the
whole
day
at
her
mother
s
house
it
saves
food
she
said
with
a
bitter
laugh
when
reardon
once
expressed
surprise
that
she
should
be
going
again
so
soon
and
gives
you
an
opportunity
of
bewailing
your
hard
fate
he
returned
coldly
the
reproach
was
ignoble
and
he
could
not
be
surprised
that
amy
left
the
house
without
another
word
to
him
yet
he
resented
that
as
he
had
resented
her
sorrowful
jest
the
feeling
of
unmanliness
in
his
own
position
tortured
him
into
a
mood
of
perversity
through
the
day
he
wrote
only
a
few
lines
and
on
amy
s
return
he
resolved
not
to
speak
to
her
there
was
a
sense
of
repose
in
this
change
of
attitude
he
encouraged
himself
in
the
view
that
amy
was
treating
him
with
cruel
neglect
she
surprised
that
her
friendly
questions
elicited
no
answer
looked
into
his
face
and
saw
a
sullen
anger
of
which
hitherto
reardon
had
never
seemed
capable
her
indignation
took
fire
and
she
left
him
to
himself
for
a
day
or
two
he
persevered
in
his
muteness
uttering
a
word
only
when
it
could
not
be
avoided
amy
was
at
first
so
resentful
that
she
contemplated
leaving
him
to
his
and
dwelling
at
her
mother
s
house
until
he
chose
to
recall
her
but
his
face
grew
so
haggard
in
fixed
misery
that
compassion
at
length
prevailed
over
her
injured
pride
late
in
the
evening
she
went
to
the
study
and
found
him
sitting
unoccupied
edwin
what
do
you
want
he
asked
indifferently
why
are
you
behaving
to
me
like
this
surely
it
makes
no
difference
to
you
how
i
behave
you
can
easily
forget
that
i
exist
and
live
your
own
what
have
i
done
to
make
this
change
in
you
is
it
a
change
you
know
it
how
did
i
behave
before
he
asked
glancing
at
her
like
yourself
kindly
and
if
i
always
did
so
in
spite
of
things
that
might
have
embittered
another
man
s
temper
i
think
it
deserved
some
return
of
kindness
from
what
things
do
you
mean
circumstances
for
which
neither
of
us
is
to
i
am
not
conscious
of
having
failed
in
kindness
said
amy
distantly
then
that
only
shows
that
you
have
forgotten
your
old
self
and
utterly
changed
in
your
feeling
to
me
when
we
first
came
to
live
here
could
you
have
imagined
yourself
leaving
me
alone
for
long
miserable
days
just
because
i
was
suffering
under
misfortunes
you
have
shown
too
plainly
that
you
don
t
care
to
give
me
the
help
even
of
a
kind
word
you
get
away
from
me
as
often
as
you
can
as
if
to
remind
me
that
we
have
no
longer
any
interests
in
common
other
people
are
your
confidants
you
speak
of
me
to
them
as
if
i
were
purposely
dragging
you
down
into
a
mean
how
can
you
know
what
i
say
about
you
isn
t
it
true
he
asked
flashing
an
angry
glance
at
her
it
is
not
true
of
course
i
have
talked
to
mother
about
our
difficulties
how
could
i
help
it
and
to
other
not
in
a
way
that
you
could
find
fault
in
a
way
that
makes
me
seem
contemptible
to
them
you
show
them
that
i
have
made
you
poor
and
unhappy
and
you
are
glad
to
have
their
what
you
mean
is
that
i
oughtn
t
to
see
anyone
there
s
no
other
way
of
avoiding
such
a
reproach
as
this
so
long
as
i
don
t
laugh
and
sing
before
people
and
assure
them
that
things
couldn
t
be
more
hopeful
i
shall
be
asking
for
their
sympathy
and
against
you
i
can
t
understand
your
i
m
afraid
there
is
very
little
in
me
that
you
can
understand
so
long
as
my
prospects
seemed
bright
you
could
sympathise
readily
enough
as
soon
as
ever
they
darkened
something
came
between
us
amy
you
haven
t
done
your
duty
your
love
hasn
t
stood
the
test
as
it
should
have
done
you
have
given
me
no
help
besides
the
burden
of
cheerless
work
i
have
had
to
bear
that
of
your
growing
coldness
i
can
t
remember
one
instance
when
you
have
spoken
to
me
as
a
wife
might
a
wife
who
was
something
more
than
a
man
s
the
passion
in
his
voice
and
the
harshness
of
the
accusation
made
her
unable
to
reply
you
said
rightly
he
went
on
that
i
have
always
been
kind
and
gentle
i
never
thought
i
could
speak
to
you
or
feel
to
you
in
any
other
way
but
i
have
undergone
too
much
and
you
have
deserted
me
surely
it
was
too
soon
to
do
that
so
long
as
i
endeavoured
my
utmost
and
loved
you
the
same
as
ever
you
might
have
remembered
all
you
once
said
to
me
you
might
have
given
me
help
but
you
haven
t
cared
the
impulses
which
had
part
in
this
outbreak
were
numerous
and
complex
he
felt
all
that
he
expressed
but
at
the
same
time
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
the
choice
between
two
ways
of
uttering
his
emotion
the
tenderly
appealing
and
the
sternly
reproachful
he
took
the
latter
course
because
it
was
less
natural
to
him
than
the
former
his
desire
was
to
impress
amy
with
the
bitter
intensity
of
his
sufferings
pathos
and
loving
words
seemed
to
have
lost
their
power
upon
her
but
perhaps
if
he
yielded
to
that
other
form
of
passion
she
would
be
shaken
out
of
her
coldness
the
stress
of
injured
love
is
always
tempted
to
speech
which
seems
its
contradiction
reardon
had
the
strangest
mixture
of
pain
and
pleasure
in
flinging
out
these
first
words
of
wrath
that
he
had
ever
addressed
to
amy
they
consoled
him
under
the
humiliating
sense
of
his
weakness
and
yet
he
watched
with
dread
his
wife
s
countenance
as
she
listened
to
him
he
hoped
to
cause
her
pain
equal
to
his
own
for
then
it
would
be
in
his
power
at
once
to
throw
off
this
disguise
and
soothe
her
with
every
softest
word
his
heart
could
suggest
that
she
had
really
ceased
to
love
him
he
could
not
durst
not
believe
but
his
nature
demanded
frequent
assurance
of
affection
amy
had
abandoned
too
soon
the
caresses
of
their
ardent
time
she
was
absorbed
in
her
maternity
and
thought
it
enough
to
be
her
husband
s
friend
ashamed
to
make
appeal
directly
for
the
tenderness
she
no
longer
offered
he
accused
her
of
utter
indifference
of
abandoning
him
and
all
but
betraying
him
that
in
she
might
show
what
really
was
in
her
heart
but
amy
made
no
movement
towards
him
how
can
you
say
that
i
have
deserted
you
she
returned
with
cold
indignation
when
did
i
refuse
to
share
your
poverty
when
did
i
grumble
at
what
we
have
had
to
go
through
ever
since
the
troubles
really
began
you
have
let
me
know
what
your
thoughts
were
even
if
you
didn
t
speak
them
you
have
never
shared
my
lot
willingly
i
can
t
recall
one
word
of
encouragement
from
you
but
many
many
which
made
the
struggle
harder
for
then
it
would
be
better
for
you
if
i
went
away
altogether
and
left
you
free
to
do
the
best
for
yourself
if
that
is
what
you
mean
by
all
this
why
not
say
it
plainly
i
won
t
be
a
burden
to
you
someone
will
give
me
a
and
you
would
leave
me
without
regret
your
only
care
would
be
that
you
were
still
bound
to
me
you
must
think
of
me
what
you
like
i
don
t
care
to
defend
you
won
t
admit
then
that
i
have
anything
to
complain
of
i
seem
to
you
simply
in
a
bad
temper
without
a
cause
to
tell
you
the
truth
that
s
just
what
i
do
think
i
came
here
to
ask
what
i
had
done
that
you
were
angry
with
me
and
you
break
out
furiously
with
all
sorts
of
vague
reproaches
you
have
much
to
endure
i
know
that
but
it
s
no
reason
why
you
should
turn
against
me
i
have
never
neglected
my
duty
is
the
duty
all
on
my
side
i
believe
there
are
very
few
wives
who
would
be
as
patient
as
i
have
reardon
gazed
at
her
for
a
moment
then
turned
away
the
distance
between
them
was
greater
than
he
had
thought
and
now
he
repented
of
having
given
way
to
an
impulse
so
alien
to
his
true
feelings
anger
only
estranged
her
whereas
by
speech
of
a
different
kind
he
might
have
won
the
caress
for
which
he
hungered
amy
seeing
that
he
would
say
nothing
more
left
him
to
himself
it
grew
late
in
the
night
the
fire
had
gone
out
but
reardon
still
sat
in
the
cold
room
thoughts
of
were
again
haunting
him
as
they
had
done
during
the
black
months
of
last
year
if
he
had
lost
amy
s
love
and
all
through
the
mental
impotence
which
would
make
it
hard
for
him
even
to
earn
bread
why
should
he
still
live
affection
for
his
child
had
no
weight
with
him
it
was
amy
s
child
rather
than
his
and
he
had
more
fear
than
pleasure
in
the
prospect
of
willie
s
growing
to
manhood
he
had
just
heard
the
workhouse
clock
strike
two
when
without
the
warning
of
a
footstep
the
door
opened
amy
came
in
she
wore
her
and
her
hair
was
arranged
for
the
night
why
do
you
stay
here
she
asked
it
was
not
the
same
voice
as
before
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
have
you
been
crying
amy
never
mind
do
you
know
what
time
it
is
he
went
towards
her
why
have
you
been
crying
there
are
many
things
to
cry
amy
have
you
any
love
for
me
still
or
has
poverty
robbed
me
of
it
all
i
have
never
said
that
i
didn
t
love
you
why
do
you
accuse
me
of
such
things
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
held
her
passionately
and
kissed
her
face
again
and
again
amy
s
tears
broke
forth
anew
why
should
we
come
to
such
utter
ruin
she
sobbed
oh
try
try
if
you
can
t
save
us
even
yet
you
know
without
my
saying
it
that
i
do
love
you
it
s
dreadful
to
me
to
think
all
our
happy
life
should
be
at
an
end
when
we
thought
of
such
a
future
together
is
it
impossible
can
t
you
work
as
you
used
to
and
succeed
as
we
felt
confident
you
would
don
t
despair
yet
edwin
do
do
try
whilst
there
is
still
time
darling
darling
if
only
i
could
i
have
thought
of
something
dearest
do
as
you
proposed
last
year
find
a
tenant
for
the
flat
whilst
we
still
have
a
little
money
and
then
go
away
into
some
quiet
country
place
where
you
can
get
back
your
health
and
live
for
very
little
and
write
another
book
a
good
book
that
ll
bring
you
reputation
again
i
and
willie
can
go
and
live
at
mother
s
for
the
summer
months
do
this
it
would
cost
you
so
little
living
alone
wouldn
t
it
you
would
know
that
i
was
well
cared
for
mother
would
be
willing
to
have
me
for
a
few
months
and
it
s
easy
to
explain
that
your
health
has
failed
that
you
re
obliged
to
go
away
for
a
but
why
shouldn
t
you
go
with
me
if
we
are
to
let
this
place
we
shouldn
t
have
enough
money
i
want
to
free
your
mind
from
the
burden
whilst
you
are
writing
and
what
is
before
us
if
we
go
on
in
this
way
you
don
t
think
you
will
get
much
for
what
you
re
writing
now
do
you
reardon
shook
his
head
then
how
can
we
live
even
till
the
end
of
the
year
something
must
be
done
you
know
if
we
get
into
poor
lodgings
what
hope
is
there
that
you
ll
be
able
to
write
anything
good
but
amy
i
have
no
faith
in
my
power
of
oh
it
would
be
different
a
few
days
a
week
or
a
fortnight
of
real
holiday
in
this
spring
weather
go
to
some
seaside
place
how
is
it
possible
that
all
your
talent
should
have
left
you
it
s
only
that
you
have
been
so
anxious
and
in
such
poor
health
you
say
i
don
t
love
you
but
i
have
thought
and
thought
what
would
be
best
for
you
to
do
how
you
could
save
yourself
how
can
you
sink
down
to
the
position
of
a
poor
clerk
in
some
office
that
can
t
be
your
fate

it
s
incredible
oh
after
such
bright
hopes
make
one
more
effort
have
you
forgotten
that
we
were
to
go
to
the
south
together
you
were
to
take
me
to
italy
and
greece
how
can
that
ever
be
if
you
fail
utterly
in
literature
how
can
you
ever
hope
to
earn
more
than
bare
sustenance
at
any
other
kind
of
work
he
all
but
lost
consciousness
of
her
words
in
gazing
at
the
face
she
held
up
to
his
you
love
me
say
again
that
you
love
me
dear
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
but
i
am
so
afraid
of
the
future
i
can
t
bear
poverty
i
have
found
that
i
can
t
bear
it
and
i
dread
to
think
of
your
becoming
only
an
ordinary
man
reardon
laughed
but
i
am
not
only
an
ordinary
man
amy
if
i
never
write
another
line
that
won
t
undo
what
i
have
done
it
s
little
enough
to
be
sure
but
you
know
what
i
am
do
you
only
love
the
author
in
me
don
t
you
think
of
me
apart
from
all
that
i
may
do
or
not
do
if
i
had
to
earn
my
living
as
a
clerk
would
that
make
me
a
clerk
in
soul
you
shall
not
fall
to
that
it
would
be
too
bitter
a
shame
to
lose
all
you
have
gained
in
these
long
years
of
work
let
me
plan
for
you
do
as
i
wish
you
are
to
be
what
we
hoped
from
the
first
take
all
the
summer
months
how
long
will
it
be
before
you
can
finish
this
short
book
a
week
or
then
finish
it
and
see
what
you
can
get
for
it
and
try
at
once
to
find
a
tenant
to
take
this
place
off
our
hands
that
would
be
pounds
saved
for
the
rest
of
the
year
you
could
live
on
so
little
by
yourself
couldn
t
you
oh
on
ten
shillings
a
week
if
need
but
not
to
starve
yourself
you
know
don
t
you
feel
that
my
plan
is
a
good
one
when
i
came
to
you
i
meant
to
speak
of
this
but
you
were
so
cruel
forgive
me
dearest
love
i
was
half
a
madman
you
have
been
so
cold
to
me
for
a
long
i
have
been
distracted
it
was
as
if
we
were
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
edge
of
a
have
you
spoken
to
your
mother
about
this
he
asked
uneasily
no
not
exactly
this
but
i
know
she
will
help
us
in
this
he
had
seated
himself
and
was
holding
her
in
his
arms
his
face
laid
against
hers
i
shall
dread
to
part
from
you
amy
that
s
such
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
it
may
mean
that
we
are
never
to
live
as
husband
and
wife
but
how
could
it
it
s
just
to
prevent
that
danger
if
we
go
on
here
till
we
have
no
money
what
s
before
us
then
wretched
lodgings
at
the
best
and
i
am
afraid
to
think
of
that
i
can
t
trust
myself
if
that
should
come
to
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
anxiously
i
hate
poverty
so
it
brings
out
all
the
worst
things
in
me
you
know
i
have
told
you
that
before
edwin
but
you
would
never
forget
that
you
are
my
wife
i
hope
not
but
i
can
t
think
of
it
i
can
t
face
it
that
would
be
the
very
worst
that
can
befall
us
and
we
are
going
to
try
our
utmost
to
escape
from
it
was
there
ever
a
man
who
did
as
much
as
you
have
done
in
literature
and
then
sank
into
hopeless
poverty
oh
many
but
at
your
age
i
mean
surely
not
at
your
age
i
m
afraid
there
have
been
such
poor
fellows
think
how
often
one
hears
of
hopeful
beginnings
new
reputations
and
then
you
hear
no
more
of
course
it
generally
means
that
the
man
has
gone
into
a
different
career
but
sometimes
sometimes
what
the
he
pointed
downward
penury
and
despair
and
a
miserable
oh
but
those
men
haven
t
a
wife
and
child
they
would
struggle
darling
they
do
struggle
but
it
s
as
if
an
weight
were
round
their
necks
it
drags
them
lower
and
lower
the
world
has
no
pity
on
a
man
who
can
t
do
or
produce
something
it
thinks
worth
money
you
may
be
a
divine
poet
and
if
some
good
fellow
doesn
t
take
pity
on
you
you
will
starve
by
the
roadside
society
is
as
blind
and
brutal
as
fate
i
have
no
right
to
complain
of
my
own
it
s
my
own
fault
in
a
sense
that
i
can
t
continue
as
well
as
i
began
if
i
could
write
books
as
good
as
the
early
ones
i
should
earn
money
for
all
that
it
s
hard
that
i
must
be
kicked
aside
as
worthless
just
because
i
don
t
know
a
it
shan
t
be
i
have
only
to
look
into
your
face
to
know
that
you
will
succeed
after
all
yours
is
the
kind
of
face
that
people
come
to
know
in
he
kissed
her
hair
and
her
eyes
and
her
mouth
how
well
i
remember
your
saying
that
before
why
have
you
grown
so
good
to
me
all
at
once
my
amy
hearing
you
speak
like
that
i
feel
there
s
nothing
beyond
my
reach
but
i
dread
to
go
away
from
you
if
i
find
that
it
is
hopeless
if
i
am
alone
somewhere
and
know
that
the
effort
is
all
in
vain
then
well
i
can
leave
you
free
if
i
can
t
support
you
it
will
be
only
just
that
i
should
give
you
back
your
i
don
t
understand
she
raised
herself
and
looked
into
his
eyes
we
won
t
talk
of
that
if
you
bid
me
go
on
with
the
struggle
i
shall
do
amy
had
hidden
her
face
and
lay
silently
in
his
arms
for
a
minute
or
two
then
she
murmured
it
is
so
cold
here
and
so
late
come
so
early
there
goes
three
o
the
next
day
they
talked
much
of
this
new
project
as
there
was
sunshine
amy
accompanied
her
husband
for
his
walk
in
the
afternoon
it
was
long
since
they
had
been
out
together
an
open
carriage
that
passed
followed
by
two
young
girls
on
horseback
gave
a
familiar
direction
to
reardon
s
thoughts
if
one
were
as
rich
as
those
people
they
pass
so
close
to
us
they
see
us
and
we
see
them
but
the
distance
between
is
infinity
they
don
t
belong
to
the
same
world
as
we
poor
wretches
they
see
everything
in
a
different
light
they
have
powers
which
would
seem
supernatural
if
we
were
suddenly
endowed
with
of
course
assented
his
companion
with
a
sigh
just
fancy
if
one
got
up
in
the
morning
with
the
thought
that
no
reasonable
desire
that
occurred
to
one
throughout
the
day
need
remain
ungratified
and
that
it
would
be
the
same
any
day
and
every
day
to
the
end
of
one
s
life
look
at
those
houses
every
detail
within
and
without
luxurious
to
have
such
a
home
as
that
and
they
are
empty
creatures
who
live
they
do
live
amy
at
all
events
whatever
may
be
their
faculties
they
all
have
free
scope
i
have
often
stood
staring
at
houses
like
these
until
i
couldn
t
believe
that
the
people
owning
them
were
mere
human
beings
like
myself
the
power
of
money
is
so
hard
to
realise
one
who
has
never
had
it
marvels
at
the
completeness
with
which
it
transforms
every
detail
of
life
compare
what
we
call
our
home
with
that
of
rich
people
it
moves
one
to
scornful
laughter
i
have
no
sympathy
with
the
stoical
point
of
view
between
wealth
and
poverty
is
just
the
difference
between
the
whole
man
and
the
maimed
if
my
lower
limbs
are
paralysed
i
may
still
be
able
to
think
but
then
there
is
such
a
thing
in
life
as
walking
as
a
poor
devil
i
may
live
nobly
but
one
happens
to
be
made
with
faculties
of
enjoyment
and
those
have
to
fall
into
atrophy
to
be
sure
most
rich
people
don
t
understand
their
happiness
if
they
did
they
would
move
and
talk
like
gods
which
indeed
they
amy
s
brow
was
shadowed
a
wise
man
in
reardon
s
position
would
not
have
chosen
this
subject
to
dilate
upon
the
difference
he
went
on
between
the
man
with
money
and
the
man
without
is
simply
this
the
one
thinks
how
shall
i
use
my
life
and
the
other
how
shall
i
keep
myself
alive
a
physiologist
ought
to
be
able
to
discover
some
curious
distinction
between
the
brain
of
a
person
who
has
never
given
a
thought
to
the
means
of
subsistence
and
that
of
one
who
has
never
known
a
day
free
from
such
cares
there
must
be
some
special
cerebral
development
representing
the
mental
anguish
kept
up
by
i
should
say
put
in
amy
that
it
affects
every
function
of
the
brain
it
isn
t
a
special
point
of
suffering
but
a
misery
that
colours
every
true
can
i
think
of
a
single
subject
in
all
the
sphere
of
my
experience
without
the
consciousness
that
i
see
it
through
the
medium
of
poverty
i
have
no
enjoyment
which
isn
t
tainted
by
that
thought
and
i
can
suffer
no
pain
which
it
doesn
t
increase
the
curse
of
poverty
is
to
the
modern
world
just
what
that
of
slavery
was
to
the
ancient
rich
and
destitute
stand
to
each
other
as
free
man
and
bond
you
remember
the
line
of
homer
i
have
often
quoted
about
the
demoralising
effect
of
enslavement
poverty
degrades
in
the
same
it
has
had
its
effect
upon
me
i
know
that
too
well
said
amy
with
bitter
frankness
reardon
glanced
at
her
and
wished
to
make
some
reply
but
he
could
not
say
what
was
in
his
thoughts
he
worked
on
at
his
story
before
he
had
reached
the
end
of
it
margaret
home
was
published
and
one
day
arrived
a
parcel
containing
the
six
copies
to
which
an
author
is
traditionally
entitled
reardon
was
not
so
old
in
authorship
that
he
could
open
the
packet
without
a
slight
flutter
of
his
pulse
the
book
was
tastefully
got
up
amy
exclaimed
with
pleasure
as
she
caught
sight
of
the
cover
and
lettering
it
may
succeed
edwin
it
doesn
t
look
like
a
book
that
fails
does
it
she
laughed
at
her
own
childishness
but
reardon
had
opened
one
of
the
volumes
and
was
glancing
over
the
beginning
of
a
chapter
good
god
he
cried
what
hellish
torment
it
was
to
write
that
page
i
did
it
one
morning
when
the
fog
was
so
thick
that
i
had
to
light
the
lamp
it
brings
cold
sweat
to
my
forehead
to
read
the
words
and
to
think
that
people
will
skim
over
it
without
a
suspicion
of
what
it
cost
the
writer
what
execrable
style
a
potboy
could
write
better
who
are
to
have
copies
no
one
if
i
could
help
it
but
i
suppose
your
mother
will
expect
one
and
milvain
i
suppose
so
he
replied
indifferently
but
not
unless
he
asks
for
it
poor
old
biffen
of
course
though
it
ll
make
him
despise
me
then
one
for
ourselves
that
leaves
two
to
light
the
fire
with
we
have
been
rather
short
of
since
we
couldn
t
afford
our
daily
will
you
let
me
give
one
to
mrs
carter
as
you
he
took
one
set
and
added
it
to
the
row
of
his
productions
which
stood
on
a
topmost
shelf
amy
laid
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
contemplated
the
effect
of
this
addition
the
works
of
edwin
reardon
she
said
with
a
smile
the
work
at
all
events
rather
a
different
thing
unfortunately
amy
if
only
i
were
back
at
the
time
when
i
wrote
on
neutral
ground
and
yet
had
you
with
me
how
full
my
mind
was
in
those
days
then
i
had
only
to
look
and
i
saw
something
now
i
strain
my
eyes
but
can
make
out
nothing
more
than
nebulous
grotesques
i
used
to
sit
down
knowing
so
well
what
i
had
to
say
now
i
strive
to
invent
and
never
come
at
anything
suppose
you
pick
up
a
needle
with
warm
supple
fingers
try
to
do
it
when
your
hand
is
stiff
and
numb
with
cold
there
s
the
difference
between
my
manner
of
work
in
those
days
and
what
it
is
but
you
are
going
to
get
back
your
health
you
will
write
better
than
we
shall
see
of
course
there
was
a
great
deal
of
miserable
struggle
even
then
but
i
remember
it
as
insignificant
compared
with
the
hours
of
contented
work
i
seldom
did
anything
in
the
mornings
except
think
and
prepare
towards
evening
i
felt
myself
getting
ready
and
at
last
i
sat
down
with
the
first
lines
buzzing
in
my
head
and
i
used
to
read
a
great
deal
at
the
same
time
whilst
i
was
writing
on
neutral
ground
i
went
solidly
through
the
divina
commedia
a
canto
each
day
very
often
i
wrote
till
after
midnight
but
occasionally
i
got
my
quantum
finished
much
earlier
and
then
i
used
to
treat
myself
to
a
ramble
about
the
streets
i
can
recall
exactly
the
places
where
some
of
my
best
ideas
came
to
me
you
remember
the
scene
in
prendergast
s
lodgings
that
flashed
on
me
late
one
night
as
i
was
turning
out
of
leicester
square
into
the
slum
that
leads
to
clare
market
ah
how
well
i
remember
and
i
went
home
to
my
garret
in
a
state
of
delightful
fever
and
scribbled
notes
furiously
before
going
to
don
t
trouble
it
ll
all
come
back
to
but
in
those
days
i
hadn
t
to
think
of
money
i
could
look
forward
and
see
provision
for
my
needs
i
never
asked
myself
what
i
should
get
for
the
book
i
assure
you
that
never
came
into
my
head
never
the
work
was
done
for
its
own
sake
no
hurry
to
finish
it
if
i
felt
that
i
wasn
t
up
to
the
mark
i
just
waited
till
the
better
mood
returned
on
neutral
ground
took
me
seven
months
now
i
have
to
write
three
volumes
in
nine
weeks
with
the
lash
stinging
on
my
back
if
i
miss
a
he
brooded
for
a
little
i
suppose
there
must
be
some
rich
man
somewhere
who
has
read
one
or
two
of
my
books
with
a
certain
interest
if
only
i
could
encounter
him
and
tell
him
plainly
what
a
cursed
state
i
am
in
perhaps
he
would
help
me
to
some
means
of
earning
a
couple
of
pounds
a
week
one
has
heard
of
such
in
the
old
yes
i
doubt
if
it
ever
happens
now
coleridge
wouldn
t
so
easily
meet
with
his
gillman
nowadays
well
i
am
not
a
coleridge
and
i
don
t
ask
to
be
lodged
under
any
man
s
roof
but
if
i
could
earn
money
enough
to
leave
me
good
long
evenings
unspoilt
by
fear
of
the
workhouse
amy
turned
away
and
presently
went
to
look
after
her
little
boy
a
few
days
after
this
they
had
a
visit
from
milvain
he
came
about
ten
o
clock
in
the
evening
i
m
not
going
to
stay
he
announced
but
where
s
my
copy
of
margaret
home
i
am
to
have
one
i
suppose
i
have
no
particular
desire
that
you
should
read
it
returned
reardon
but
i
have
read
it
my
dear
fellow
got
it
from
the
library
on
the
day
of
publication
i
had
a
suspicion
that
you
wouldn
t
send
me
a
copy
but
i
must
possess
your
opera
here
it
is
hide
it
away
you
may
as
well
sit
down
for
a
few
i
confess
i
should
like
to
talk
about
the
book
if
you
don
t
mind
it
isn
t
so
utterly
and
damnably
bad
as
you
make
out
you
know
the
misfortune
was
that
you
had
to
make
three
volumes
of
it
if
i
had
leave
to
cut
it
down
to
one
it
would
do
you
credit
the
motive
is
good
yes
just
good
enough
to
show
how
badly
it
s
milvain
began
to
expatiate
on
that
topic
the
evils
of
the
system
a
monster
sucking
the
blood
of
english
novelists
one
might
design
an
allegorical
cartoon
for
a
comic
literary
paper
why
doesn
t
such
a
thing
exist
a
weekly
paper
treating
of
things
and
people
literary
in
a
facetious
spirit
it
would
be
caviare
to
the
general
but
might
be
supported
i
should
think
the
editor
would
probably
be
assassinated
for
anyone
in
my
position
said
reardon
how
is
it
possible
to
abandon
the
three
volumes
it
is
a
question
of
payment
an
author
of
moderate
repute
may
live
on
a
yearly
novel
i
mean
the
man
who
is
obliged
to
sell
his
book
out
and
out
and
who
gets
from
one
to
two
hundred
pounds
for
it
but
he
would
have
to
produce
four
novels
to
obtain
the
same
income
and
i
doubt
whether
he
could
get
so
many
published
within
the
twelve
months
and
here
comes
in
the
benefit
of
the
libraries
from
the
commercial
point
of
view
the
libraries
are
indispensable
do
you
suppose
the
public
would
support
the
present
number
of
novelists
if
each
book
had
to
be
purchased
a
sudden
change
to
that
system
would
throw
of
the
novelists
out
of
but
there
s
no
reason
why
the
libraries
shouldn
t
circulate
novels
in
one
profits
would
be
less
i
suppose
people
would
take
the
minimum
well
to
go
to
the
concrete
what
about
your
own
all
but
and
you
ll
offer
it
to
jedwood
go
and
see
him
personally
he
s
a
very
decent
fellow
i
milvain
stayed
only
half
an
hour
the
days
when
he
was
wont
to
sit
and
talk
at
large
through
a
whole
evening
were
no
more
partly
because
of
his
diminished
leisure
but
also
for
a
less
simple
reason
the
growth
of
something
like
estrangement
between
him
and
reardon
you
didn
t
mention
your
plans
said
amy
when
the
visitor
had
been
gone
some
time
reardon
was
content
with
the
negative
and
his
wife
made
no
further
remark
the
result
of
advertising
the
flat
was
that
two
or
three
persons
called
to
make
inspection
one
of
them
a
man
of
military
appearance
showed
himself
anxious
to
come
to
terms
he
was
willing
to
take
the
tenement
from
next
june
but
wished
if
possible
to
enter
upon
possession
sooner
than
that
nothing
could
be
better
said
amy
in
colloquy
with
her
husband
if
he
will
pay
for
the
extra
time
we
shall
be
only
too
reardon
mused
and
looked
gloomy
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
regard
the
experiment
before
him
with
hopefulness
and
his
heart
sank
at
the
thought
of
parting
from
amy
you
are
very
anxious
to
get
rid
of
me
he
answered
trying
to
smile
yes
i
am
she
exclaimed
but
simply
for
your
own
good
as
you
know
very
suppose
i
can
t
sell
this
book
you
will
have
a
few
pounds
send
your
pliny
article
to
the
wayside
if
you
come
to
an
end
of
all
your
money
mother
shall
lend
you
i
am
not
very
likely
to
do
much
work
in
that
oh
but
you
will
sell
the
book
you
ll
get
twenty
pounds
for
it
and
that
alone
would
keep
you
for
three
months
think
three
months
of
the
best
part
of
the
year
at
the
seaside
oh
you
will
do
wonders
the
furniture
was
to
be
housed
at
mrs
yule
s
neither
of
them
durst
speak
of
selling
it
that
would
have
sounded
too
ominous
as
for
the
locality
of
reardon
s
retreat
amy
herself
had
suggested
worthing
which
she
knew
from
a
visit
a
few
years
ago
the
advantages
were
its
proximity
to
london
and
the
likelihood
that
very
cheap
lodgings
could
be
found
either
in
the
town
or
near
it
one
room
would
suffice
for
the
hapless
author
and
his
expenses
beyond
a
trifling
rent
would
be
confined
to
mere
food
oh
yes
he
might
manage
on
considerably
less
than
a
pound
a
week
amy
was
in
much
better
spirits
than
for
a
long
time
she
appeared
to
have
convinced
herself
that
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
issue
of
this
perilous
scheme
that
her
husband
would
write
a
notable
book
receive
a
satisfactory
price
for
it
and
so
their
home
yet
her
moods
varied
greatly
after
all
there
was
delay
in
the
letting
of
the
flat
and
this
caused
her
annoyance
it
was
whilst
the
negotiations
were
still
pending
that
she
made
her
call
upon
maud
and
dora
milvain
reardon
did
not
know
of
her
intention
to
visit
them
until
it
had
been
carried
out
she
mentioned
what
she
had
done
in
almost
a
casual
manner
i
had
to
get
it
over
she
said
when
reardon
exhibited
surprise
and
i
don
t
think
i
made
a
very
favourable
you
told
them
i
suppose
what
we
are
going
to
do
no
i
didn
t
say
a
word
of
but
why
not
it
can
t
be
kept
a
secret
milvain
will
have
heard
of
it
already
i
should
think
from
your
from
mother
but
it
s
the
rarest
thing
for
him
to
go
there
do
you
imagine
he
is
a
constant
visitor
i
thought
it
better
to
say
nothing
until
the
thing
is
actually
done
who
knows
what
may
happen
she
was
in
a
strange
nervous
state
and
reardon
regarded
her
uneasily
he
talked
very
little
in
these
days
and
passed
hours
in
dark
reverie
his
book
was
finished
and
he
awaited
the
publisher
s
decision
part
three
chapter
xvi
rejection
one
of
reardon
s
minor
worries
at
this
time
was
the
fear
that
by
chance
he
might
come
upon
a
review
of
margaret
since
the
publication
of
his
first
book
he
had
avoided
as
far
as
possible
all
knowledge
of
what
the
critics
had
to
say
about
him
his
nervous
temperament
could
not
bear
the
agitation
of
reading
these
remarks
which
however
inept
define
an
author
and
his
work
to
so
many
people
incapable
of
judging
for
themselves
no
man
or
woman
could
tell
him
anything
in
the
way
of
praise
or
blame
which
he
did
not
already
know
quite
well
commendation
was
pleasant
but
it
so
often
aimed
amiss
and
censure
was
for
the
most
part
so
unintelligent
in
the
case
of
this
latest
novel
he
dreaded
the
sight
of
a
review
as
he
would
have
done
a
gash
from
a
rusty
knife
the
judgments
could
not
but
be
damnatory
and
their
expression
in
journalistic
phrase
would
disturb
his
mind
with
evil
rancour
no
one
would
have
insight
enough
to
appreciate
the
nature
and
cause
of
his
book
s
demerits
every
comment
would
be
wide
of
the
mark
sneer
ridicule
trite
objection
would
but
madden
him
with
a
sense
of
injustice
his
position
was
illogical
one
result
of
the
moral
weakness
which
was
allied
with
his
aesthetic
sensibility
putting
aside
the
worthlessness
of
current
reviewing
the
critic
of
an
isolated
book
has
of
course
nothing
to
do
with
its
author
s
state
of
mind
and
body
any
more
than
with
the
condition
of
his
purse
reardon
would
have
granted
this
but
he
could
not
command
his
emotions
he
was
in
passionate
revolt
against
the
base
necessities
which
compelled
him
to
put
forth
work
in
no
way
representing
his
healthy
powers
his
artistic
criterion
not
he
had
written
this
book
but
his
accursed
poverty
to
assail
him
as
the
author
was
in
his
feeling
to
be
guilty
of
brutal
insult
when
by
a
notice
in
one
of
the
daily
papers
came
under
his
eyes
it
made
his
blood
boil
with
a
fierceness
of
hatred
only
possible
to
him
in
a
profoundly
morbid
condition
he
could
not
steady
his
hand
for
half
an
hour
after
yet
this
particular
critic
only
said
what
was
quite
true
that
the
novel
contained
not
a
single
striking
scene
and
not
one
living
character
reardon
had
expressed
himself
about
it
in
almost
identical
terms
but
he
saw
himself
in
the
position
of
one
sickly
and
all
but
destitute
man
against
a
relentless
world
and
every
blow
directed
against
him
appeared
dastardly
he
could
have
cried
coward
to
the
writer
who
wounded
him
the
sensational
story
which
was
now
in
mr
jedwood
s
hands
had
perhaps
more
merit
than
margaret
home
its
brevity
and
the
fact
that
nothing
more
was
aimed
at
than
a
concatenation
of
brisk
events
made
it
not
unreadable
but
reardon
thought
of
it
with
humiliation
if
it
were
published
as
his
next
work
it
would
afford
final
proof
to
such
sympathetic
readers
as
he
might
still
retain
that
he
had
hopelessly
written
himself
out
and
was
now
endeavouring
to
adapt
himself
to
an
inferior
public
in
spite
of
his
dire
necessities
he
now
and
then
hoped
that
jedwood
might
refuse
the
thing
at
moments
he
looked
with
sanguine
eagerness
to
the
three
or
four
months
he
was
about
to
spend
in
retirement
but
such
impulses
were
the
mere
outcome
of
his
nervous
disease
he
had
no
faith
in
himself
under
present
conditions
the
permanence
of
his
sufferings
would
mean
the
sure
destruction
of
powers
he
still
possessed
though
they
were
not
at
his
command
yet
he
believed
that
his
mind
was
made
up
as
to
the
advisability
of
trying
this
last
resource
he
was
impatient
for
the
day
of
departure
and
in
the
interval
merely
killed
time
as
best
he
might
he
could
not
read
and
did
not
attempt
to
gather
ideas
for
his
next
book
the
delusion
that
his
mind
was
resting
made
an
excuse
to
him
for
the
barrenness
of
day
after
day
his
pliny
article
had
been
despatched
to
the
wayside
and
would
possibly
be
accepted
but
he
did
not
trouble
himself
about
this
or
other
details
it
was
as
though
his
mind
could
do
nothing
more
than
grasp
the
bald
fact
of
impending
destitution
with
the
steps
towards
that
final
stage
he
seemed
to
have
little
concern
one
evening
he
set
forth
to
make
a
call
upon
harold
biffen
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
the
realist
called
to
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
a
copy
of
margaret
home
left
at
his
lodgings
when
he
was
out
biffen
resided
in
clipstone
street
a
thoroughfare
discoverable
in
the
dim
district
which
lies
between
portland
place
and
tottenham
court
road
on
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
reardon
learnt
that
his
friend
was
at
home
he
ascended
to
the
third
storey
and
tapped
at
a
door
which
allowed
rays
of
lamplight
to
issue
from
great
gaps
above
and
below
a
sound
of
voices
came
from
within
and
on
entering
he
perceived
that
biffen
was
engaged
with
a
pupil
they
didn
t
tell
me
you
had
a
visitor
he
said
i
ll
call
again
no
need
to
go
away
replied
biffen
coming
forward
to
shake
hands
take
a
book
for
a
few
minutes
mr
baker
won
t
it
was
a
very
small
room
with
a
ceiling
so
low
that
the
tall
lodger
could
only
just
stand
upright
with
safety
perhaps
three
inches
intervened
between
his
head
and
the
plaster
which
was
cracked
grimy
cobwebby
a
small
scrap
of
weedy
carpet
lay
in
front
of
the
fireplace
elsewhere
the
chinky
boards
were
unconcealed
the
furniture
consisted
of
a
round
table
which
kept
such
imperfect
balance
on
its
central
support
that
the
lamp
entrusted
to
it
looked
in
a
dangerous
position
of
three
small
chairs
a
small
with
sundry
rude
appurtenances
and
a
which
the
tenant
opened
at
the
hour
of
repose
and
spread
with
certain
primitive
trappings
at
present
kept
in
a
cupboard
there
was
no
bookcase
but
a
few
hundred
battered
volumes
were
arranged
some
on
the
floor
and
some
on
a
rough
chest
the
weather
was
too
characteristic
of
an
english
spring
to
make
an
empty
grate
agreeable
to
the
eye
but
biffen
held
it
an
axiom
that
fires
were
unseasonable
after
the
first
of
may
the
individual
referred
to
as
mr
baker
who
sat
at
the
table
in
the
attitude
of
a
student
was
a
robust
young
man
of
judging
from
his
cheeks
and
huge
hands
as
well
as
from
the
garb
he
wore
one
would
have
presumed
that
study
was
not
his
normal
occupation
there
was
something
of
the
riverside
about
him
he
might
be
a
dockman
or
even
a
bargeman
he
looked
intelligent
however
and
bore
himself
with
much
modesty
now
do
endeavour
to
write
in
shorter
sentences
said
biffen
who
sat
down
by
him
and
resumed
the
lesson
reardon
having
taken
up
a
volume
this
isn
t
bad
it
isn
t
bad
at
all
i
assure
you
but
you
have
put
all
you
had
to
say
into
three
appalling
periods
whereas
you
ought
to
have
made
about
a
there
it
is
sir
there
it
is
exclaimed
the
man
smoothing
his
wiry
hair
i
can
t
break
it
up
the
thoughts
come
in
a
lump
if
i
may
say
so
to
break
it
up
there
s
the
art
of
reardon
could
not
refrain
from
a
glance
at
the
speaker
and
biffen
whose
manner
was
very
grave
and
kindly
turned
to
his
friend
with
an
explanation
of
the
difficulties
with
which
the
student
was
struggling
mr
baker
is
preparing
for
the
examination
of
the
outdoor
customs
department
one
of
the
subjects
is
english
composition
and
really
you
know
that
isn
t
quite
such
a
simple
matter
as
some
people
baker
beamed
upon
the
visitor
with
a
homely
smile
i
can
make
headway
with
the
other
things
sir
he
said
striking
the
table
lightly
with
his
clenched
fist
there
s
handwriting
there
s
orthography
there
s
arithmetic
i
m
not
afraid
of
one
of
em
as
mr
biffen
ll
tell
you
sir
but
when
it
comes
to
compersition
that
brings
out
the
sweat
on
my
forehead
i
do
assure
you
you
re
not
the
only
man
in
that
case
mr
baker
replied
reardon
it
s
thought
a
tough
job
in
general
is
it
sir
it
is
two
hundred
marks
for
compersition
continued
the
man
now
how
many
would
they
have
given
me
for
this
bit
of
a
try
mr
biffen
well
well
i
can
t
exactly
say
but
you
improve
you
improve
decidedly
peg
away
for
another
week
or
oh
don
t
fear
me
sir
i
m
not
easily
beaten
when
i
ve
set
my
mind
on
a
thing
and
i
ll
break
up
the
compersition
yet
see
if
i
don
t
again
his
fist
descended
upon
the
table
in
a
way
that
reminded
one
of
the
cracking
a
nut
the
lesson
proceeded
for
about
ten
minutes
reardon
under
pretence
of
reading
following
it
with
as
much
amusement
as
anything
could
excite
in
him
nowadays
at
length
mr
baker
stood
up
collected
his
papers
and
books
and
seemed
about
to
depart
but
after
certain
uneasy
movements
and
glances
he
said
to
biffen
in
a
subdued
voice
perhaps
i
might
speak
to
you
outside
the
door
a
minute
sir
he
and
the
teacher
went
out
the
door
closed
and
reardon
heard
sounds
of
muffled
conversation
in
a
minute
or
two
a
heavy
footstep
descended
the
stairs
and
biffen
the
room
now
that
s
a
good
honest
fellow
he
said
in
an
amused
tone
it
s
my
but
he
didn
t
like
to
fork
out
money
before
you
a
very
unusual
delicacy
in
a
man
of
that
standing
he
pays
me
sixpence
for
an
hour
s
lesson
that
brings
me
two
shillings
a
week
i
sometimes
feel
a
little
ashamed
to
take
his
money
but
then
the
fact
is
he
s
a
good
deal
better
off
than
i
will
he
get
a
place
in
the
customs
do
you
think
oh
i
ve
no
doubt
of
it
if
it
seemed
unlikely
i
should
have
told
him
so
before
this
to
be
sure
that
s
a
point
i
have
often
to
consider
and
once
or
twice
my
delicacy
has
asserted
itself
at
the
expense
of
my
pocket
there
was
a
poor
consumptive
lad
came
to
me
not
long
ago
and
wanted
latin
lessons
talked
about
going
in
for
the
london
on
his
way
to
the
pulpit
i
couldn
t
stand
it
after
a
lesson
or
two
i
told
him
his
cough
was
too
bad
and
he
had
no
right
to
study
until
he
got
into
better
health
that
was
better
i
think
than
saying
plainly
he
had
no
chance
on
earth
but
the
food
i
bought
with
his
money
was
choking
me
oh
yes
baker
will
make
his
way
right
enough
a
good
modest
fellow
you
noticed
how
respectfully
he
spoke
to
me
it
doesn
t
make
any
difference
to
him
that
i
live
in
a
garret
like
this
i
m
a
man
of
education
and
he
can
separate
this
fact
from
my
biffen
why
don
t
you
get
some
decent
position
surely
you
what
position
no
school
would
take
me
i
have
neither
credentials
nor
conventional
clothing
for
the
same
reason
i
couldn
t
get
a
private
tutorship
in
a
rich
family
no
no
it
s
all
right
i
keep
myself
alive
and
i
get
on
with
my
i
ve
decided
to
write
a
book
called
mr
bailey
what
s
the
idea
an
objectionable
word
that
better
say
what
s
the
reality
well
mr
bailey
is
a
grocer
in
a
little
street
by
here
i
have
dealt
with
him
for
a
long
time
and
as
he
s
a
talkative
fellow
i
ve
come
to
know
a
good
deal
about
him
and
his
history
he
s
fond
of
talking
about
the
struggle
he
had
in
his
first
year
of
business
he
had
no
money
of
his
own
but
he
married
a
woman
who
had
saved
pounds
out
of
a
cat
business
you
should
see
that
woman
a
big
coarse
squinting
creature
at
the
time
of
the
marriage
she
was
a
widow
and
years
old
now
i
m
going
to
tell
the
true
story
of
mr
bailey
s
marriage
and
of
his
progress
as
a
grocer
it
ll
be
a
great
book
a
great
book
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
fervid
with
his
conception
there
ll
be
nothing
bestial
in
it
you
know
the
decently
ignoble
as
i
ve
so
often
said
the
thing
ll
take
me
a
year
at
least
i
shall
do
it
slowly
lovingly
one
volume
of
course
the
length
of
the
ordinary
french
novel
there
s
something
fine
in
the
title
don
t
you
think
mr
bailey
grocer
i
envy
you
old
fellow
said
reardon
sighing
you
have
the
right
fire
in
you
you
have
zeal
and
energy
well
what
do
you
think
i
have
decided
to
do
i
should
like
to
reardon
gave
an
account
of
his
project
the
other
listened
gravely
seated
across
a
chair
with
his
arms
on
the
back
your
wife
is
in
agreement
with
this
oh
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
say
that
amy
had
suggested
it
she
has
great
hopes
that
the
change
will
be
just
what
i
i
should
say
so
too
if
you
were
going
to
rest
but
if
you
have
to
set
to
work
at
once
it
seems
to
me
very
never
mind
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
discourage
me
if
this
fails
i
think
upon
my
soul
i
think
i
shall
kill
pooh
exclaimed
biffen
gently
with
a
wife
like
yours
just
because
of
no
no
there
ll
be
some
way
out
of
it
i
passed
mrs
reardon
this
morning
but
she
didn
t
see
me
it
was
in
tottenham
court
road
and
milvain
was
with
her
i
felt
myself
too
seedy
in
appearance
to
stop
and
in
tottenham
court
road
that
was
not
the
detail
of
the
story
which
chiefly
held
reardon
s
attention
yet
he
did
not
purposely
make
a
misleading
remark
his
mind
involuntarily
played
this
trick
i
only
saw
them
just
as
they
were
passing
pursued
biffen
oh
i
knew
i
had
something
to
tell
you
have
you
heard
that
whelpdale
is
going
to
be
married
reardon
shook
his
head
in
a
preoccupied
way
i
had
a
note
from
him
this
morning
telling
me
he
asked
me
to
look
him
up
and
he
d
let
me
know
all
about
it
let
s
go
together
shall
we
i
don
t
feel
much
in
the
humour
for
whelpdale
i
ll
walk
with
you
and
go
on
no
no
come
and
see
him
it
ll
do
you
good
to
talk
a
but
i
must
positively
eat
a
mouthful
before
we
go
i
m
afraid
you
won
t
care
to
join
he
opened
his
cupboard
and
brought
out
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
saucer
of
dripping
with
salt
and
pepper
better
dripping
this
than
i
ve
had
for
a
long
time
i
get
it
at
mr
bailey
s
that
isn
t
his
real
name
of
course
he
assures
me
it
comes
from
a
large
hotel
where
his
wife
s
sister
is
a
and
that
it
s
perfectly
pure
they
very
often
mix
flour
with
it
you
know
and
perhaps
more
obnoxious
things
that
an
economical
man
doesn
t
care
to
reflect
upon
now
with
a
little
pepper
and
salt
this
bread
and
dripping
is
as
appetising
food
as
i
know
i
often
make
a
dinner
of
i
have
done
the
same
myself
before
now
do
you
ever
buy
i
should
think
so
i
get
magnificent
pennyworths
at
a
shop
in
cleveland
street
of
a
very
rich
quality
indeed
excellent
faggots
they
have
there
too
i
ll
give
you
a
supper
of
them
some
night
before
you
biffen
rose
to
enthusiasm
in
the
contemplation
of
these
dainties
he
ate
his
bread
and
dripping
with
knife
and
fork
this
always
made
the
fare
seem
more
substantial
is
it
very
cold
out
he
asked
rising
from
the
table
need
i
put
my
overcoat
on
this
overcoat
purchased
three
years
ago
hung
on
a
comparative
ease
of
circumstances
had
restored
to
the
realist
his
ordinary
indoor
garment
a
morning
coat
of
the
cloth
called
diagonal
rather
large
for
him
but
in
better
preservation
than
the
other
articles
of
his
attire
reardon
judging
the
overcoat
necessary
his
friend
carefully
brushed
it
and
drew
it
on
with
a
caution
which
probably
had
reference
to
starting
seams
then
he
put
into
the
pocket
his
pipe
his
pouch
his
and
his
matches
murmuring
to
himself
a
greek
iambic
line
which
had
come
into
his
head
a
propos
of
nothing
obvious
go
out
he
said
and
then
i
ll
extinguish
the
lamp
mind
the
second
step
down
as
they
issued
into
clipstone
street
turned
northward
crossed
euston
road
and
came
into
albany
street
where
in
a
house
of
decent
exterior
mr
whelpdale
had
his
present
abode
a
girl
who
opened
the
door
requested
them
to
walk
up
to
the
topmost
storey
a
cheery
voice
called
to
them
from
within
the
room
at
which
they
knocked
this
lodging
spoke
more
distinctly
of
civilisation
than
that
inhabited
by
biffen
it
contained
the
minimum
supply
of
furniture
needed
to
give
it
somewhat
the
appearance
of
a
study
but
the
articles
were
in
good
condition
one
end
of
the
room
was
concealed
by
a
chintz
curtain
scrutiny
would
have
discovered
behind
the
draping
the
essential
equipments
of
a
bedchamber
mr
whelpdale
sat
by
the
fire
smoking
a
cigar
he
was
a
but
graceful
and
man
of
thirty
with
wavy
chestnut
hair
and
a
trimmed
beard
which
became
him
well
at
present
he
wore
a
and
was
without
collar
welcome
gents
both
he
cried
facetiously
ages
since
i
saw
you
reardon
i
ve
been
reading
your
new
book
uncommonly
good
things
in
it
here
and
there
uncommonly
whelpdale
had
the
weakness
of
being
unable
to
tell
a
disagreeable
truth
and
a
tendency
to
flattery
which
had
always
made
reardon
rather
uncomfortable
in
his
society
though
there
was
no
need
whatever
of
his
mentioning
margaret
home
he
preferred
to
frame
smooth
fictions
rather
than
keep
a
silence
which
might
be
construed
as
unfavourable
criticism
in
the
last
volume
he
went
on
i
think
there
are
one
or
two
things
as
good
as
you
ever
did
i
do
reardon
made
no
acknowledgment
of
these
remarks
they
irritated
him
for
he
knew
their
insincerity
biffen
understanding
his
friend
s
silence
struck
in
on
another
subject
who
is
this
lady
of
whom
you
write
to
me
ah
quite
a
story
i
m
going
to
be
married
reardon
a
serious
marriage
light
your
pipes
and
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
startled
you
i
suppose
biffen
unlikely
news
eh
some
people
would
call
it
a
rash
step
i
dare
say
we
shall
just
take
another
room
in
this
house
that
s
all
i
think
i
can
count
upon
an
income
of
a
couple
of
guineas
a
week
and
i
have
plans
without
end
that
are
pretty
sure
to
bring
in
reardon
did
not
care
to
smoke
but
biffen
lit
his
pipe
and
waited
with
grave
interest
for
the
romantic
narrative
whenever
he
heard
of
a
poor
man
s
persuading
a
woman
to
share
his
poverty
he
was
eager
of
details
perchance
he
himself
might
yet
have
that
heavenly
good
fortune
well
began
whelpdale
crossing
his
legs
and
watching
a
wreath
he
had
just
puffed
from
the
cigar
you
know
all
about
my
literary
advisership
the
business
goes
on
reasonably
well
i
m
going
to
extend
it
in
ways
i
ll
explain
to
you
presently
about
six
weeks
ago
i
received
a
letter
from
a
lady
who
referred
to
my
advertisements
and
said
she
had
the
manuscript
of
a
novel
which
she
would
like
to
offer
for
my
opinion
two
publishers
had
refused
it
but
one
with
complimentary
phrases
and
she
hoped
it
mightn
t
be
impossible
to
put
the
thing
into
acceptable
shape
of
course
i
wrote
optimistically
and
the
manuscript
was
sent
to
me
well
it
wasn
t
actually
bad
by
jove
you
should
have
seen
some
of
the
things
i
have
been
asked
to
recommend
to
publishers
it
wasn
t
hopelessly
bad
by
any
means
and
i
gave
serious
thought
to
it
after
exchange
of
several
letters
i
asked
the
authoress
to
come
and
see
me
that
we
might
save
postage
stamps
and
talk
things
over
she
hadn
t
given
me
her
address
i
had
to
direct
to
a
stationer
s
in
bayswater
she
agreed
to
come
and
did
come
i
had
formed
a
sort
of
idea
but
of
course
i
was
quite
wrong
imagine
my
excitement
when
there
came
in
a
very
beautiful
girl
a
tremendously
interesting
girl
about
just
the
kind
of
girl
that
most
strongly
appeals
to
me
dark
pale
rather
slender
no
there
s
no
describing
her
there
really
isn
t
you
must
wait
till
you
see
i
hope
the
consumption
was
only
a
figure
of
speech
remarked
biffen
in
his
grave
way
oh
there
s
nothing
serious
the
matter
i
think
a
slight
cough
poor
the
deuce
interjected
reardon
oh
nothing
nothing
it
ll
be
all
right
well
now
of
course
we
talked
over
the
story
in
good
earnest
you
know
little
by
little
i
induced
her
to
speak
of
herself
this
after
she
d
come
two
or
three
times
and
she
told
me
lamentable
things
she
was
absolutely
alone
in
london
and
hadn
t
had
sufficient
food
for
weeks
had
sold
all
she
could
of
her
clothing
and
so
on
her
home
was
in
birmingham
she
had
been
driven
away
by
the
brutality
of
a
stepmother
a
friend
lent
her
a
few
pounds
and
she
came
to
london
with
an
unfinished
novel
well
you
know
this
kind
of
thing
would
be
enough
to
make
me
to
any
girl
let
alone
one
who
to
begin
with
was
absolutely
my
ideal
when
she
began
to
express
a
fear
that
i
was
giving
too
much
time
to
her
that
she
wouldn
t
be
able
to
pay
my
fees
and
so
on
i
could
restrain
myself
no
longer
on
the
spot
i
asked
her
to
marry
me
i
didn
t
practise
any
deception
mind
i
told
her
i
was
a
poor
devil
who
had
failed
as
a
realistic
novelist
and
was
earning
bread
in
haphazard
ways
and
i
explained
frankly
that
i
thought
we
might
carry
on
various
kinds
of
business
together
she
might
go
on
with
her
and
so
on
but
she
was
frightened
i
had
been
too
abrupt
that
s
a
fault
of
mine
you
know
but
i
was
so
confoundedly
afraid
of
losing
her
and
i
told
her
as
much
biffen
smiled
this
would
be
exciting
he
said
if
we
didn
t
know
the
end
of
the
yes
pity
i
didn
t
keep
it
a
secret
well
she
wouldn
t
say
yes
but
i
could
see
that
she
didn
t
absolutely
say
no
in
any
case
i
said
you
ll
let
me
see
you
often
fees
be
hanged
i
ll
work
day
and
night
for
you
i
ll
do
my
utmost
to
get
your
novel
and
i
implored
her
to
let
me
lend
her
a
little
money
it
was
very
difficult
to
persuade
her
but
at
last
she
accepted
a
few
shillings
i
could
see
in
her
face
that
she
was
hungry
just
imagine
a
beautiful
girl
absolutely
hungry
it
drove
me
frantic
but
that
was
a
great
point
gained
after
that
we
saw
each
other
almost
every
day
and
at
last
she
consented
did
indeed
i
can
hardly
believe
it
yet
we
shall
be
married
in
a
fortnight
s
i
congratulate
you
said
reardon
so
do
i
sighed
biffen
the
day
before
yesterday
she
went
to
birmingham
to
see
her
father
and
tell
him
all
about
the
affair
i
agreed
with
her
it
was
as
well
the
old
fellow
isn
t
badly
off
and
he
may
forgive
her
for
running
away
though
he
s
under
his
wife
s
thumb
it
appears
i
had
a
note
yesterday
she
had
gone
to
a
friend
s
house
for
the
first
day
i
hoped
to
have
heard
again
this
morning
must
in
any
case
i
live
as
you
may
imagine
in
wild
excitement
of
course
if
the
old
man
stumps
up
a
wedding
present
all
the
better
but
i
don
t
care
we
ll
make
a
living
somehow
what
do
you
think
i
m
writing
just
now
an
author
s
guide
you
know
the
kind
of
thing
they
sell
splendidly
of
course
i
shall
make
it
a
good
advertisement
of
my
business
then
i
have
a
splendid
idea
i
m
going
to
advertise
taught
in
ten
lessons
what
do
you
think
of
that
no
swindle
not
a
bit
of
it
i
am
quite
capable
of
giving
the
ordinary
man
or
woman
ten
very
useful
lessons
i
ve
been
working
out
the
scheme
it
would
amuse
you
vastly
reardon
the
first
lesson
deals
with
the
question
of
subjects
local
colour
that
kind
of
thing
i
gravely
advise
people
if
they
possibly
can
to
write
of
the
wealthy
middle
class
that
s
the
popular
subject
you
know
lords
and
ladies
are
all
very
well
but
the
real
thing
to
take
is
a
story
about
people
who
have
no
titles
but
live
in
good
philistine
style
i
urge
study
of
horsey
matters
especially
that
s
very
important
you
must
be
well
up
too
in
military
grades
know
about
sandhurst
and
so
on
boating
is
an
important
topic
you
see
oh
i
shall
make
a
great
thing
of
this
i
shall
teach
my
wife
carefully
and
then
let
her
advertise
lessons
to
girls
they
ll
prefer
coming
to
a
woman
you
biffen
leant
back
and
laughed
noisily
how
much
shall
you
charge
for
the
course
asked
reardon
that
ll
depend
i
shan
t
refuse
a
guinea
or
two
but
some
people
may
be
made
to
pay
five
someone
knocked
at
the
door
and
a
voice
said
a
letter
for
you
mr
he
started
up
and
came
back
into
the
room
with
face
illuminated
yes
it
s
from
birmingham
posted
this
morning
look
what
an
exquisite
hand
she
writes
he
tore
open
the
envelope
in
delicacy
reardon
and
biffen
averted
their
eyes
there
was
silence
for
a
minute
then
a
strange
ejaculation
from
whelpdale
caused
his
friends
to
look
up
at
him
he
had
gone
pale
and
was
frowning
at
the
sheet
of
paper
which
trembled
in
his
hand
no
bad
news
i
hope
biffen
ventured
to
say
whelpdale
let
himself
sink
into
a
chair
now
if
this
isn
t
too
bad
he
exclaimed
in
a
thick
voice
if
this
isn
t
monstrously
unkind
i
never
heard
anything
so
gross
as
this
never
the
two
waited
trying
not
to
smile
she
writes
that
she
has
met
an
old
lover
in
birmingham
that
it
was
with
him
she
had
with
her
father
at
all
that
she
ran
away
to
annoy
him
and
frighten
him
that
she
has
made
it
up
again
and
they
re
going
to
be
married
he
let
the
sheet
fall
and
looked
so
utterly
woebegone
that
his
friends
at
once
exerted
themselves
to
offer
such
consolation
as
the
case
admitted
of
reardon
thought
better
of
whelpdale
for
this
emotion
he
had
not
believed
him
capable
of
it
it
isn
t
a
case
of
vulgar
cheating
cried
the
forsaken
one
presently
don
t
go
away
thinking
that
she
writes
in
real
distress
and
penitence
she
does
indeed
oh
the
devil
why
did
i
let
her
go
to
birmingham
a
fortnight
more
and
i
should
have
had
her
safe
but
it
s
just
like
my
luck
do
you
know
that
this
is
the
third
time
i
ve
been
engaged
to
be
married
no
by
jove
the
fourth
and
every
time
the
girl
has
got
out
of
it
at
the
last
moment
what
an
unlucky
beast
i
am
a
girl
who
was
positively
my
ideal
i
haven
t
even
a
photograph
of
her
to
show
you
but
you
d
be
astonished
at
her
face
why
in
the
devil
s
name
did
i
let
her
go
to
birmingham
the
visitors
had
risen
they
felt
uncomfortable
for
it
seemed
as
if
whelpdale
might
find
vent
for
his
distress
in
tears
we
had
better
leave
you
suggested
biffen
it
s
very
hard
it
is
look
here
read
the
letter
for
yourselves
do
they
declined
and
begged
him
not
to
insist
but
i
want
you
to
see
what
kind
of
girl
she
is
it
isn
t
a
case
of
farcical
deceiving
not
a
bit
of
it
she
implores
me
to
forgive
her
and
blames
herself
no
end
just
my
luck
the
third
no
the
fourth
time
by
jove
never
was
such
an
unlucky
fellow
with
women
it
s
because
i
m
so
damnably
poor
that
s
it
of
course
reardon
and
his
companion
succeeded
at
length
in
getting
away
though
not
till
they
had
heard
the
virtues
and
beauty
of
the
vanished
girl
described
again
and
again
in
much
detail
both
were
in
a
state
of
depression
as
they
left
the
house
what
think
you
of
this
story
asked
biffen
is
this
possible
in
a
woman
of
any
merit
anything
is
possible
in
a
woman
reardon
replied
harshly
they
walked
in
silence
as
far
as
portland
road
station
there
with
an
assurance
that
he
would
come
to
a
before
leaving
london
reardon
parted
from
his
friend
and
turned
westward
as
soon
as
he
had
entered
amy
s
voice
called
to
him
here
s
a
letter
from
jedwood
edwin
he
stepped
into
the
study
it
came
just
after
you
went
out
and
it
has
been
all
i
could
do
to
resist
the
temptation
to
open
why
shouldn
t
you
have
opened
it
said
her
husband
carelessly
he
tried
to
do
so
himself
but
his
shaking
hand
thwarted
him
at
first
succeeding
at
length
he
found
a
letter
in
the
publisher
s
own
writing
and
the
first
word
that
caught
his
attention
was
with
an
angry
effort
to
command
himself
he
ran
through
the
communication
then
held
it
out
to
amy
she
read
and
her
countenance
fell
mr
jedwood
regretted
that
the
story
offered
to
him
did
not
seem
likely
to
please
that
particular
public
to
whom
his
series
of
novels
made
appeal
he
hoped
it
would
be
understood
that
in
declining
he
by
no
means
expressed
an
adverse
judgment
on
the
story
itself
it
doesn
t
surprise
me
said
reardon
i
believe
he
is
quite
right
the
thing
is
too
empty
to
please
the
better
kind
of
readers
yet
not
vulgar
enough
to
please
the
but
you
ll
try
someone
else
i
don
t
think
it
s
much
they
sat
opposite
each
other
and
kept
silence
jedwood
s
letter
slipped
from
amy
s
lap
to
the
ground
so
said
reardon
presently
i
don
t
see
how
our
plan
is
to
be
carried
oh
it
must
be
but
how
you
ll
get
seven
or
eight
pounds
from
the
wayside
and
hadn
t
we
better
sell
the
furniture
instead
of
his
look
checked
her
it
seems
to
me
amy
that
your
one
desire
is
to
get
away
from
me
on
whatever
don
t
begin
that
over
again
she
exclaimed
fretfully
if
you
don
t
believe
what
i
say
they
were
both
in
a
state
of
intolerable
nervous
tension
their
voices
quivered
and
their
eyes
had
an
unnatural
brightness
if
we
sell
the
furniture
pursued
reardon
that
means
you
ll
never
come
back
to
me
you
wish
to
save
yourself
and
the
child
from
the
hard
life
that
seems
to
be
before
yes
i
do
but
not
by
deserting
you
i
want
you
to
go
and
work
for
us
all
so
that
we
may
live
more
happily
before
long
oh
how
wretched
this
is
she
burst
into
hysterical
weeping
but
reardon
instead
of
attempting
to
soothe
her
went
into
the
next
room
where
he
sat
for
a
long
time
in
the
dark
when
he
returned
amy
was
calm
again
her
face
expressed
a
cold
misery
where
did
you
go
this
morning
he
asked
as
if
wishing
to
talk
of
common
things
i
told
you
i
went
to
buy
those
things
for
oh
there
was
a
silence
biffen
passed
you
in
tottenham
court
road
he
added
i
didn
t
see
no
he
said
you
didn
perhaps
said
amy
it
was
just
when
i
was
speaking
to
mr
you
met
milvain
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
i
can
t
mention
every
trifle
that
no
of
course
amy
closed
her
eyes
as
if
in
weariness
and
for
a
minute
or
two
reardon
observed
her
countenance
so
you
think
we
had
better
sell
the
i
shall
say
nothing
more
about
it
you
must
do
as
seems
best
to
you
are
you
going
to
see
your
mother
yes
i
thought
you
would
like
to
come
no
there
s
no
good
in
my
he
again
rose
and
that
night
they
talked
no
more
of
their
difficulties
though
on
the
morrow
sunday
it
would
be
necessary
to
decide
their
course
in
every
detail
chapter
xvii
the
parting
amy
did
not
go
to
church
before
her
marriage
she
had
done
so
as
a
mere
matter
of
course
accompanying
her
mother
but
reardon
s
attitude
with
regard
to
the
popular
religion
speedily
became
her
own
she
let
the
subject
lapse
from
her
mind
and
cared
neither
to
defend
nor
to
attack
where
dogma
was
concerned
she
had
no
sympathies
with
mysticism
her
nature
was
strongly
practical
with
something
of
zeal
for
intellectual
attainment
superadded
this
sunday
morning
she
was
very
busy
with
domestic
minutiae
reardon
noticed
what
looked
like
preparations
for
packing
and
being
as
little
disposed
for
conversation
as
his
wife
he
went
out
and
walked
for
a
couple
of
hours
in
the
hampstead
region
dinner
over
amy
at
once
made
ready
for
her
journey
to
westbourne
park
then
you
won
t
come
she
said
to
her
husband
no
i
shall
see
your
mother
before
i
go
away
but
i
don
t
care
to
till
you
have
settled
it
was
half
a
year
since
he
had
met
mrs
yule
she
never
came
to
their
dwelling
and
reardon
could
not
bring
himself
to
visit
her
you
had
very
much
rather
we
didn
t
sell
the
furniture
amy
asked
ask
your
mother
s
opinion
that
shall
there
ll
be
the
expense
of
moving
it
you
know
unless
money
comes
from
the
wayside
you
ll
only
have
two
or
three
pounds
reardon
made
no
reply
he
was
overcome
by
the
bitterness
of
shame
i
shall
say
then
pursued
amy
who
spoke
with
averted
face
that
i
am
to
go
there
for
good
on
tuesday
i
mean
of
course
for
the
summer
i
suppose
then
he
turned
suddenly
upon
her
do
you
really
imagine
that
at
the
end
of
the
summer
i
shall
be
a
rich
man
what
do
you
mean
by
talking
in
this
way
if
the
furniture
is
sold
to
supply
me
with
a
few
pounds
for
the
present
what
prospect
is
there
that
i
shall
be
able
to
buy
new
how
can
we
look
forward
at
all
replied
amy
it
has
come
to
the
question
of
how
we
are
to
subsist
i
thought
you
would
rather
get
money
in
this
way
than
borrow
of
mother
when
she
has
the
expense
of
keeping
me
and
you
are
right
muttered
reardon
do
as
you
think
amy
was
in
her
most
practical
mood
and
would
not
linger
for
purposeless
talk
a
few
minutes
and
reardon
was
left
alone
he
stood
before
his
bookshelves
and
began
to
pick
out
the
volumes
which
he
would
take
away
with
him
just
a
few
the
indispensable
companions
of
a
bookish
man
who
still
clings
to
life
his
homer
his
shakespeare
the
rest
must
be
sold
he
would
get
rid
of
them
morning
all
together
they
might
bring
him
a
couple
of
sovereigns
then
his
clothing
amy
had
fulfilled
all
the
domestic
duties
of
a
wife
his
wardrobe
was
in
as
good
a
state
as
circumstances
allowed
but
there
was
no
object
in
burdening
himself
with
winter
garments
for
if
he
lived
through
the
summer
at
all
he
would
be
able
to
repurchase
such
few
poor
things
as
were
needful
at
present
he
could
only
think
of
how
to
get
together
a
few
coins
so
he
made
a
heap
of
such
things
as
might
be
sold
the
furniture
if
it
must
go
the
price
could
scarcely
be
more
than
ten
or
twelve
pounds
well
perhaps
fifteen
to
be
sure
in
this
way
his
summer
s
living
would
be
abundantly
provided
for
he
thought
of
biffen
enviously
biffen
if
need
be
could
support
life
on
three
or
four
shillings
a
week
happy
in
the
thought
that
no
mortal
had
a
claim
upon
him
if
he
starved
to
death
well
many
another
lonely
man
has
come
to
that
end
if
he
preferred
to
kill
himself
who
would
be
distressed
spoilt
child
of
fortune
the
bells
of
st
marylebone
began
to
clang
for
afternoon
service
in
the
idleness
of
dull
pain
his
thoughts
followed
their
summons
and
he
marvelled
that
there
were
people
who
could
imagine
it
a
duty
or
find
it
a
solace
to
go
and
sit
in
that
twilight
church
and
listen
to
the
droning
of
prayers
he
thought
of
the
wretched
millions
of
mankind
to
whom
life
is
so
barren
that
they
must
needs
believe
in
a
recompense
beyond
the
grave
for
that
he
neither
looked
nor
longed
the
bitterness
of
his
lot
was
that
this
world
might
be
a
sufficing
paradise
to
him
if
only
he
could
clutch
a
poor
little
share
of
current
coin
he
had
won
the
world
s
greatest
prize
a
woman
s
love
but
could
not
retain
it
because
his
pockets
were
empty
that
he
should
fail
to
make
a
great
name
this
was
grievous
disappointment
to
amy
but
this
alone
would
not
have
estranged
her
it
was
the
dread
and
shame
of
penury
that
made
her
heart
cold
to
him
and
he
could
not
in
his
conscience
scorn
her
for
being
thus
affected
by
the
vulgar
circumstances
of
life
only
a
few
supreme
natures
stand
unshaken
under
such
a
trial
and
though
his
love
of
amy
was
still
passionate
he
knew
that
her
place
was
among
a
certain
class
of
women
and
not
on
the
isolated
pinnacle
where
he
had
at
first
visioned
her
it
was
entirely
natural
that
she
shrank
at
the
test
of
squalid
suffering
a
little
money
and
he
could
have
rested
secure
in
her
love
for
then
he
would
have
been
able
to
keep
ever
before
her
the
best
qualities
of
his
heart
and
brain
upon
him
too
penury
had
its
debasing
effect
as
he
now
presented
himself
he
was
not
a
man
to
be
admired
or
loved
it
was
all
simple
and
intelligible
enough
a
situation
that
would
be
misread
only
by
shallow
idealism
worst
of
all
she
was
attracted
by
jasper
milvain
s
energy
and
promise
of
success
he
had
no
ignoble
suspicions
of
amy
but
it
was
impossible
for
him
not
to
see
that
she
habitually
contrasted
the
young
journalist
who
laughingly
made
his
way
among
men
with
her
grave
dispirited
husband
who
was
not
even
capable
of
holding
such
position
as
he
had
gained
she
enjoyed
milvain
s
conversation
it
put
her
into
a
good
humour
she
liked
him
personally
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
she
had
observed
a
jealous
tendency
in
reardon
s
attitude
to
his
former
friend
always
a
harmful
suggestion
to
a
woman
formerly
she
had
appreciated
her
husband
s
superiority
she
had
smiled
at
milvain
s
commoner
stamp
of
mind
and
character
but
tedious
repetition
of
failure
had
outwearied
her
and
now
she
saw
milvain
in
the
sunshine
of
progress
dwelt
upon
the
worldly
advantages
of
gifts
and
a
temperament
such
as
his
again
simple
and
intelligible
enough
living
apart
from
her
husband
she
could
not
be
expected
to
forswear
society
and
doubtless
she
would
see
milvain
pretty
often
he
called
occasionally
at
mrs
yule
s
and
would
not
do
so
less
often
when
he
knew
that
amy
was
to
be
met
there
there
would
be
chance
encounters
like
that
of
yesterday
of
which
she
had
chosen
to
keep
silence
a
dark
fear
began
to
shadow
him
in
yielding
thus
passively
to
stress
of
circumstances
was
he
not
exposing
his
wife
to
a
danger
which
outweighed
all
the
ills
of
poverty
as
one
to
whom
she
was
inestimably
dear
was
he
right
in
allowing
her
to
leave
him
if
only
for
a
few
months
he
knew
very
well
that
a
man
of
strong
character
would
never
have
entertained
this
project
he
had
got
into
the
way
of
thinking
of
himself
as
too
weak
to
struggle
against
the
obstacles
on
which
amy
insisted
and
of
looking
for
safety
in
retreat
but
what
was
to
be
the
end
of
this
weakness
if
the
summer
did
not
at
all
advance
him
he
knew
better
than
amy
could
how
unlikely
it
was
that
he
should
recover
the
energies
of
his
mind
in
so
short
a
time
and
under
such
circumstances
only
the
feeble
man
s
temptation
to
postpone
effort
had
made
him
consent
to
this
step
and
now
that
he
was
all
but
beyond
turning
back
the
perils
of
which
he
had
thought
too
little
forced
themselves
upon
his
mind
he
rose
in
anguish
and
stood
looking
about
him
as
if
aid
might
somewhere
be
visible
presently
there
was
a
knock
at
the
front
door
and
on
opening
he
beheld
the
vivacious
mr
carter
this
gentleman
had
only
made
two
or
three
calls
here
since
reardon
s
marriage
his
appearance
was
a
surprise
i
hear
you
are
leaving
town
for
a
time
he
exclaimed
edith
told
me
yesterday
so
i
thought
i
d
look
you
he
was
in
spring
costume
and
exhaled
fresh
odours
the
contrast
between
his
prosperous
animation
and
reardon
s
quietness
could
not
have
been
more
striking
going
away
for
your
health
they
tell
me
you
ve
been
working
too
hard
you
know
you
mustn
t
overdo
it
and
where
do
you
think
of
going
to
it
isn
t
at
all
certain
that
i
shall
go
reardon
replied
i
thought
of
a
few
weeks
somewhere
at
the
i
advise
you
to
go
north
went
on
carter
cheerily
you
want
a
tonic
you
know
get
up
into
scotland
and
do
some
boating
and
fishing
that
kind
of
thing
you
d
come
back
a
new
man
edith
and
i
had
a
turn
up
there
last
year
you
know
it
did
me
heaps
of
oh
i
don
t
think
i
should
go
so
far
as
but
that
s
just
what
you
want
a
regular
change
something
bracing
you
don
t
look
at
all
well
that
s
the
fact
a
winter
in
london
tries
any
man
it
does
me
i
know
i
ve
been
seedy
myself
these
last
few
weeks
edith
wants
me
to
take
her
over
to
paris
at
the
end
of
this
month
and
i
think
it
isn
t
a
bad
idea
but
i
m
so
confoundedly
busy
in
the
autumn
we
shall
go
to
norway
i
think
it
seems
to
be
the
right
thing
to
do
nowadays
why
shouldn
t
you
have
a
run
over
to
norway
they
say
it
can
be
done
very
cheaply
the
steamers
take
you
for
next
to
he
talked
on
with
the
joyous
satisfaction
of
a
man
whose
income
is
assured
and
whose
future
teems
with
a
succession
of
lively
holidays
reardon
could
make
no
answer
to
such
suggestions
he
sat
with
a
fixed
smile
on
his
face
have
you
heard
said
carter
presently
that
we
re
opening
a
branch
of
the
hospital
in
the
city
road
no
i
hadn
t
heard
of
it
ll
only
be
for
open
three
mornings
and
three
evenings
who
ll
represent
you
there
i
shall
look
in
now
and
then
of
course
there
ll
be
a
clerk
like
at
the
old
he
talked
of
the
matter
in
detail
of
the
doctors
who
would
attend
and
of
certain
new
arrangements
to
be
tried
have
you
engaged
the
clerk
reardon
asked
not
yet
i
think
i
know
a
man
who
ll
suit
me
you
wouldn
t
be
disposed
to
give
me
the
chance
reardon
spoke
huskily
and
ended
with
a
broken
laugh
you
re
rather
above
my
figure
nowadays
old
man
exclaimed
carter
joining
in
what
he
considered
the
jest
shall
you
pay
a
pound
a
week
shillings
it
ll
have
to
be
a
man
who
can
be
trusted
to
take
money
from
the
paying
well
i
am
serious
will
you
give
me
the
place
carter
gazed
at
him
and
checked
another
laugh
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
the
fact
is
reardon
replied
i
want
variety
of
occupation
i
can
t
stick
at
writing
for
more
than
a
month
or
two
at
a
time
it
s
because
i
have
tried
to
do
so
that
well
practically
i
have
broken
down
if
you
will
give
me
this
clerkship
it
will
relieve
me
from
the
necessity
of
perpetually
writing
novels
i
shall
be
better
for
it
in
every
way
you
know
that
i
m
equal
to
the
job
you
can
trust
me
and
i
dare
say
i
shall
be
more
useful
than
most
clerks
you
could
it
was
done
most
happily
done
on
the
first
impulse
a
minute
more
of
pause
and
he
could
not
have
faced
the
humiliation
his
face
burned
his
tongue
was
parched
i
m
floored
cried
carter
i
shouldn
t
have
thought
but
of
course
if
you
really
want
it
i
can
hardly
believe
yet
that
you
re
serious
why
not
will
you
promise
me
the
work
well
when
shall
i
have
to
begin
the
place
ll
be
opened
week
but
how
about
your
holiday
oh
let
that
stand
over
it
ll
be
holiday
enough
to
occupy
myself
in
a
new
way
an
old
way
too
i
shall
enjoy
he
laughed
merrily
relieved
beyond
measure
at
having
come
to
what
seemed
an
end
of
his
difficulties
for
half
an
hour
they
continued
to
talk
over
the
affair
well
it
s
a
comical
idea
said
carter
as
he
took
his
leave
but
you
know
your
own
business
when
amy
returned
reardon
allowed
her
to
put
the
child
to
bed
before
he
sought
any
conversation
she
came
at
length
and
sat
down
in
the
study
mother
advises
us
not
to
sell
the
furniture
were
her
first
words
i
m
glad
of
that
as
i
had
quite
made
up
my
mind
not
there
was
a
change
in
his
way
of
speaking
which
she
at
once
noticed
have
you
thought
of
something
yes
carter
has
been
here
and
he
happened
to
mention
that
they
re
opening
an
department
of
the
hospital
in
the
city
road
he
ll
want
someone
to
help
him
there
i
asked
for
the
post
and
he
promised
it
the
last
words
were
hurried
though
he
had
resolved
to
speak
with
deliberation
no
more
feebleness
he
had
taken
a
decision
and
would
act
upon
it
as
became
a
responsible
man
the
post
said
amy
what
post
in
plain
english
the
clerkship
it
ll
be
the
same
work
as
i
used
to
have
registering
patients
receiving
their
letters
and
so
on
the
pay
is
to
be
shillings
a
amy
sat
upright
and
looked
steadily
at
him
is
this
a
joke
far
from
it
dear
it
s
a
blessed
you
have
asked
mr
carter
to
take
you
back
as
a
clerk
i
and
you
propose
that
we
shall
live
on
shillings
a
week
oh
no
i
shall
be
engaged
only
three
mornings
in
the
week
and
three
evenings
in
my
free
time
i
shall
do
literary
work
and
no
doubt
i
can
earn
fifty
pounds
a
year
by
it
if
i
have
your
sympathy
to
help
me
i
shall
go
and
look
for
rooms
some
distance
from
here
in
islington
i
think
we
have
been
living
far
beyond
our
means
that
must
come
to
an
end
we
ll
have
no
more
keeping
up
of
sham
appearances
if
i
can
make
my
way
in
literature
well
and
good
in
that
case
our
position
and
prospects
will
of
course
change
but
for
the
present
we
are
poor
people
and
must
live
in
a
poor
way
if
our
friends
like
to
come
and
see
us
they
must
put
aside
all
snobbishness
and
take
us
as
we
are
if
they
prefer
not
to
come
there
ll
be
an
excuse
in
our
amy
was
stroking
the
back
of
her
hand
after
a
long
silence
she
said
in
a
very
quiet
but
very
resolute
tone
i
shall
not
consent
to
in
that
case
amy
i
must
do
without
your
consent
the
rooms
will
be
taken
and
our
furniture
transferred
to
to
me
that
will
make
no
difference
returned
his
wife
in
the
same
voice
as
before
i
have
decided
as
you
told
me
to
to
go
with
willie
to
mother
s
next
tuesday
you
of
course
must
do
as
you
please
i
should
have
thought
a
summer
at
the
seaside
would
have
been
more
helpful
to
you
but
if
you
prefer
to
live
in
islington
reardon
approached
her
and
laid
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
amy
are
you
my
wife
or
not
i
am
certainly
not
the
wife
of
a
clerk
who
is
paid
so
much
a
he
had
foreseen
a
struggle
but
without
certainty
of
the
form
amy
s
opposition
would
take
for
himself
he
meant
to
be
gently
resolute
calmly
regardless
of
protest
but
in
a
man
to
whom
such
is
a
matter
of
conscious
effort
tremor
of
the
nerves
will
always
interfere
with
the
line
of
conduct
he
has
conceived
in
advance
already
reardon
had
spoken
with
far
more
bluntness
than
he
proposed
involuntarily
his
voice
slipped
from
earnest
determination
to
the
note
of
absolutism
and
as
is
wont
to
be
the
case
the
sound
of
these
strange
tones
instigated
him
to
further
utterances
of
the
same
kind
he
lost
control
of
himself
amy
s
last
reply
went
through
him
like
an
electric
shock
and
for
the
moment
he
was
a
mere
husband
defied
by
his
wife
the
male
stung
to
exertion
of
his
brute
force
against
the
physically
weaker
sex
however
you
regard
me
you
will
do
what
i
think
fit
i
shall
not
argue
with
you
if
i
choose
to
take
lodgings
in
whitechapel
there
you
will
come
and
he
met
amy
s
full
look
and
was
conscious
of
that
in
it
which
corresponded
to
his
own
brutality
she
had
become
suddenly
a
much
older
woman
her
cheeks
were
tight
drawn
into
thinness
her
lips
were
bloodlessly
hard
there
was
an
unknown
furrow
along
her
forehead
and
she
glared
like
the
animal
that
defends
itself
with
tooth
and
claw
do
as
you
think
fit
indeed
could
amy
s
voice
sound
like
that
great
heaven
with
just
such
accent
he
had
heard
a
wrangling
woman
retort
upon
her
husband
at
the
street
corner
is
there
then
no
essential
difference
between
a
woman
of
this
world
and
one
of
that
does
the
same
nature
lie
beneath
such
unlike
surfaces
he
had
but
to
do
one
thing
to
seize
her
by
the
arm
drag
her
up
from
the
chair
dash
her
back
again
with
all
his
force
there
the
transformation
would
be
complete
they
would
stand
towards
each
other
on
the
natural
footing
with
an
added
curse
perhaps
instead
of
that
he
choked
struggled
for
breath
and
shed
tears
amy
turned
scornfully
away
from
him
blows
and
a
curse
would
have
overawed
her
at
all
events
for
the
moment
she
would
have
felt
yes
he
is
a
man
and
i
have
put
my
destiny
into
his
his
tears
moved
her
to
a
feeling
cruelly
exultant
they
were
the
sign
of
her
superiority
it
was
she
who
should
have
wept
and
never
in
her
life
had
she
been
further
from
such
display
of
weakness
this
could
not
be
the
end
however
and
she
had
no
wish
to
terminate
the
scene
they
stood
for
a
minute
without
regarding
each
other
then
reardon
faced
to
her
you
refuse
to
live
with
me
then
yes
if
this
is
the
kind
of
life
you
offer
you
would
be
more
ashamed
to
share
your
husband
s
misfortunes
than
to
declare
to
everyone
that
you
had
deserted
him
i
shall
declare
to
everyone
the
simple
truth
you
have
the
opportunity
of
making
one
more
effort
to
save
us
from
degradation
you
refuse
to
take
the
trouble
you
prefer
to
drag
me
down
into
a
lower
rank
of
life
i
can
t
and
won
t
consent
to
that
the
disgrace
is
yours
it
s
fortunate
for
me
that
i
have
a
decent
home
to
go
fortunate
for
you
you
make
yourself
unutterably
contemptible
i
have
done
nothing
that
justifies
you
in
leaving
me
it
is
for
me
to
judge
what
i
can
do
and
what
i
can
t
a
good
woman
would
see
no
degradation
in
what
i
ask
of
you
but
to
run
away
from
me
just
because
i
am
poorer
than
you
ever
thought
i
should
be
he
was
incoherent
a
thousand
passionate
things
that
he
wished
to
say
clashed
together
in
his
mind
and
confused
his
speech
defeated
in
the
attempt
to
act
like
a
strong
man
he
could
not
yet
recover
knew
not
how
to
tone
his
utterances
yes
of
course
that
s
how
you
will
put
it
said
amy
that
s
how
you
will
represent
me
to
your
friends
my
friends
will
see
it
in
a
different
they
will
regard
you
as
a
martyr
no
one
shall
make
a
martyr
of
me
you
may
be
sure
i
was
unfortunate
enough
to
marry
a
man
who
had
no
delicacy
no
regard
for
my
i
am
not
the
first
woman
who
has
made
a
mistake
of
this
no
delicacy
no
regard
for
your
feelings
have
i
always
utterly
misunderstood
you
or
has
poverty
changed
you
to
a
woman
i
can
t
recognise
he
came
nearer
and
gazed
desperately
into
her
face
not
a
muscle
of
it
showed
susceptibility
to
the
old
influences
do
you
know
amy
he
added
in
a
lower
voice
that
if
we
part
now
we
part
for
ever
i
m
afraid
that
is
only
too
she
moved
aside
you
mean
that
you
wish
it
you
are
weary
of
me
and
care
for
nothing
but
how
to
make
yourself
i
shall
argue
no
more
i
am
tired
to
death
of
then
say
nothing
but
listen
for
the
last
time
to
my
view
of
the
position
we
have
come
to
when
i
consented
to
leave
you
for
a
time
to
go
away
and
try
to
work
in
solitude
i
was
foolish
and
even
insincere
both
to
you
and
to
myself
i
knew
that
i
was
undertaking
the
impossible
it
was
just
putting
off
the
evil
day
that
was
all
putting
off
the
time
when
i
should
have
to
say
plainly
i
can
t
live
by
literature
so
i
must
look
out
for
some
other
i
shouldn
t
have
been
so
weak
but
that
i
knew
how
you
would
regard
such
a
decision
as
that
i
was
afraid
to
tell
the
truth
afraid
now
when
carter
of
a
sudden
put
this
opportunity
before
me
i
saw
all
the
absurdity
of
the
arrangements
we
had
made
it
didn
t
take
me
a
moment
to
make
up
my
mind
anything
was
to
be
chosen
rather
than
a
parting
from
you
on
false
pretences
a
ridiculous
affectation
of
hope
where
there
was
no
he
paused
and
saw
that
his
words
had
no
effect
upon
her
and
a
grievous
share
of
the
fault
lies
with
you
amy
you
remember
very
well
when
i
first
saw
how
dark
the
future
was
i
was
driven
even
to
say
that
we
ought
to
change
our
mode
of
living
i
asked
you
if
you
would
be
willing
to
leave
this
place
and
go
into
cheaper
rooms
and
you
know
what
your
answer
was
not
a
sign
in
you
that
you
would
stand
by
me
if
the
worst
came
i
knew
then
what
i
had
to
look
forward
to
but
i
durst
not
believe
it
i
kept
saying
to
myself
she
loves
me
and
as
soon
as
she
really
understands
that
was
all
if
i
had
been
a
wise
man
i
should
have
spoken
to
you
in
a
way
you
couldn
t
mistake
i
should
have
told
you
that
we
were
living
recklessly
and
that
i
had
determined
to
alter
it
i
have
no
delicacy
no
regard
for
your
feelings
oh
if
i
had
had
less
i
doubt
whether
you
can
even
understand
some
of
the
considerations
that
weighed
with
me
and
made
me
cowardly
though
i
once
thought
there
was
no
refinement
of
sensibility
that
you
couldn
t
enter
into
yes
i
was
absurd
enough
to
say
to
myself
it
will
look
as
if
i
had
consciously
deceived
her
she
may
suffer
from
the
thought
that
i
won
her
at
all
hazards
knowing
that
i
should
soon
expose
her
to
poverty
and
all
sorts
of
impossible
to
speak
of
that
again
i
had
to
struggle
desperately
on
trying
to
hope
oh
if
you
knew
his
voice
gave
way
for
an
instant
i
don
t
understand
how
you
could
be
so
thoughtless
and
heartless
you
knew
that
i
was
almost
mad
with
anxiety
at
times
surely
any
woman
must
have
had
the
impulse
to
give
what
help
was
in
her
power
how
could
you
hesitate
had
you
no
suspicion
of
what
a
relief
and
encouragement
it
would
be
to
me
if
you
said
yes
we
must
go
and
live
in
a
simpler
way
if
only
as
a
proof
that
you
loved
me
how
i
should
have
welcomed
that
you
helped
me
in
nothing
you
threw
all
the
responsibility
upon
me
always
bearing
in
mind
i
suppose
that
there
was
a
refuge
for
you
even
now
i
despise
myself
for
saying
such
things
of
you
though
i
know
so
bitterly
that
they
are
true
it
takes
a
long
time
to
see
you
as
such
a
different
woman
from
the
one
i
worshipped
in
passion
i
can
fling
out
violent
words
but
they
don
t
yet
answer
to
my
actual
feeling
it
will
be
long
enough
yet
before
i
think
contemptuously
of
you
you
know
that
when
a
light
is
suddenly
extinguished
the
image
of
it
still
shows
before
your
eyes
but
at
last
comes
the
amy
turned
towards
him
once
more
instead
of
saying
all
this
you
might
be
proving
that
i
am
wrong
do
so
and
i
will
gladly
confess
that
you
are
wrong
i
don
t
see
your
you
might
prove
that
you
are
willing
to
do
your
utmost
to
save
me
from
amy
i
have
done
my
utmost
i
have
done
more
than
you
can
no
you
have
toiled
on
in
illness
and
anxiety
i
know
that
but
a
chance
is
offered
you
now
of
working
in
a
better
way
till
that
is
tried
you
have
no
right
to
give
all
up
and
try
to
drag
me
down
with
i
don
t
know
how
to
answer
i
have
told
you
so
often
you
can
t
understand
me
i
can
i
can
her
voice
trembled
for
the
first
time
i
know
that
you
are
so
ready
to
give
in
to
difficulties
listen
to
me
and
do
as
i
bid
she
spoke
in
the
strangest
tone
of
command
it
was
command
not
exhortation
but
there
was
no
harshness
in
her
voice
go
at
once
to
mr
carter
tell
him
you
have
made
a
ludicrous
mistake
in
a
fit
of
low
spirits
anything
you
like
to
say
tell
him
you
of
course
couldn
t
dream
of
becoming
his
clerk
at
once
you
understand
me
edwin
go
now
this
have
you
determined
to
see
how
weak
i
am
do
you
wish
to
be
able
to
despise
me
more
completely
still
i
am
determined
to
be
your
friend
and
to
save
you
from
yourself
go
at
once
leave
all
the
rest
to
me
if
i
have
let
things
take
their
course
till
now
it
shan
t
be
so
in
future
the
responsibility
shall
be
with
me
only
do
as
i
tell
you
know
it
s
impossible
it
is
not
i
will
find
money
no
one
shall
be
allowed
to
say
that
we
are
parting
no
one
has
any
such
idea
yet
you
are
going
away
for
your
health
just
three
summer
months
i
have
been
far
more
careful
of
appearances
than
you
imagine
but
you
give
me
credit
for
so
little
i
will
find
the
money
you
need
until
you
have
written
another
book
i
promise
i
undertake
it
then
i
will
find
another
home
for
us
of
the
proper
kind
you
shall
have
no
trouble
you
shall
give
yourself
entirely
to
intellectual
things
but
mr
carter
must
be
told
at
once
before
he
can
spread
a
report
if
he
has
spoken
he
must
contradict
what
he
has
but
you
amaze
me
amy
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
look
upon
it
as
a
veritable
disgrace
my
taking
this
clerkship
i
do
i
can
t
help
my
nature
i
am
ashamed
through
and
through
that
you
should
sink
to
but
everyone
knows
that
i
was
a
clerk
once
very
few
people
know
it
and
then
that
isn
t
the
same
thing
it
doesn
t
matter
what
one
has
been
in
the
past
especially
a
literary
man
everyone
expects
to
hear
that
he
was
once
poor
but
to
fall
from
the
position
you
now
have
and
to
take
weekly
wages
you
surely
can
t
know
how
people
of
my
world
regard
of
your
world
i
had
thought
your
world
was
the
same
as
mine
and
knew
nothing
whatever
of
these
it
is
getting
late
go
and
see
mr
carter
and
afterwards
i
will
talk
as
much
as
you
he
might
perhaps
have
yielded
but
the
unemphasised
contempt
in
that
last
sentence
was
more
than
he
could
bear
it
demonstrated
to
him
more
completely
than
set
terms
could
have
done
what
a
paltry
weakling
he
would
appear
in
amy
s
eyes
if
he
took
his
hat
down
from
the
peg
and
set
out
to
obey
her
orders
you
are
asking
too
much
he
said
with
unexpected
coldness
if
my
opinions
are
so
valueless
to
you
that
you
dismiss
them
like
those
of
a
troublesome
child
i
wonder
you
think
it
worth
while
to
try
and
keep
up
appearances
about
me
it
is
very
simple
make
known
to
everyone
that
you
are
in
no
way
connected
with
the
disgrace
i
have
brought
upon
myself
put
an
advertisement
in
the
newspapers
to
that
effect
if
you
like
as
men
do
about
their
wives
debts
i
have
chosen
my
part
i
can
t
stultify
myself
to
please
she
knew
that
this
was
final
his
voice
had
the
true
ring
of
shame
in
revolt
then
go
your
way
and
i
will
go
mine
amy
left
the
room
when
reardon
went
into
the
bedchamber
an
hour
later
he
unfolded
a
that
stood
there
threw
some
rugs
upon
it
and
so
lay
down
to
pass
the
night
he
did
not
close
his
eyes
amy
slept
for
an
hour
or
two
before
dawn
and
on
waking
she
started
up
and
looked
anxiously
about
the
room
but
neither
spoke
there
was
a
pretence
of
ordinary
breakfast
the
little
servant
necessitated
that
when
she
saw
her
husband
preparing
to
go
out
amy
asked
him
to
come
into
the
study
how
long
shall
you
be
away
she
asked
curtly
it
is
doubtful
i
am
going
to
look
for
then
no
doubt
i
shall
be
gone
when
you
come
back
there
s
no
object
now
in
my
staying
here
till
as
you
do
you
wish
lizzie
still
to
come
no
please
to
pay
her
wages
and
dismiss
her
here
is
some
i
think
you
had
better
let
me
see
to
he
flung
the
coin
on
to
the
table
and
opened
the
door
amy
stepped
quickly
forward
and
closed
it
again
this
is
our
is
it
she
asked
her
eyes
on
the
ground
as
you
wish
it
you
will
remember
that
i
have
not
wished
in
that
case
you
have
only
to
go
with
me
to
the
new
i
can
then
you
have
made
your
she
did
not
prevent
his
opening
the
door
this
time
and
he
passed
out
without
looking
at
her
his
return
was
at
three
in
the
afternoon
amy
and
the
child
were
gone
the
servant
was
gone
the
table
in
the
was
spread
as
if
for
one
person
s
meal
he
went
into
the
bedroom
amy
s
trunks
had
disappeared
the
child
s
cot
was
covered
over
in
the
study
he
saw
that
the
sovereign
he
had
thrown
on
to
the
table
still
lay
in
the
same
place
as
it
was
a
very
cold
day
he
lit
a
fire
whilst
it
burnt
up
he
sat
reading
a
torn
portion
of
a
newspaper
and
became
quite
interested
in
the
report
of
a
commercial
meeting
in
the
city
a
thing
he
would
never
have
glanced
at
under
ordinary
circumstances
the
fragment
fell
at
length
from
his
hands
his
head
drooped
he
sank
into
a
troubled
sleep
about
six
he
had
tea
then
began
the
packing
of
the
few
books
that
were
to
go
with
him
and
of
such
other
things
as
could
be
enclosed
in
box
or
portmanteau
after
a
couple
of
hours
of
this
occupation
he
could
no
longer
resist
his
weariness
so
he
went
to
bed
before
falling
asleep
he
heard
the
two
familiar
clocks
strike
eight
this
evening
they
were
in
unusual
accord
and
the
querulous
notes
from
the
workhouse
sounded
between
the
deeper
ones
from
st
marylebone
reardon
tried
to
remember
when
he
had
last
observed
this
the
matter
seemed
to
have
a
peculiar
interest
for
him
and
in
dreams
he
worried
himself
with
a
grotesque
speculation
thence
derived
chapter
xviii
the
old
home
before
her
marriage
mrs
edmund
yule
was
one
of
seven
motherless
sisters
who
constituted
the
family
of
a
dentist
slenderly
provided
in
the
matter
of
income
the
pinching
and
paring
which
was
a
chief
employment
of
her
energies
in
those
early
days
had
disagreeable
effects
upon
a
character
disposed
rather
to
generosity
than
the
reverse
during
her
husband
s
lifetime
she
had
enjoyed
rather
too
eagerly
all
the
good
things
which
he
put
at
her
command
sometimes
forgetting
that
a
wife
has
duties
as
well
as
claims
and
in
her
widowhood
she
indulged
a
pretentiousness
and
querulousness
which
were
the
natural
but
not
amiable
results
of
suddenly
restricted
circumstances
like
the
majority
of
london
people
she
occupied
a
house
of
which
the
rent
absurdly
exceeded
the
due
proportion
of
her
income
a
pleasant
foible
turned
to
such
good
account
by
london
landlords
whereas
she
might
have
lived
with
a
good
deal
of
modest
comfort
her
existence
was
a
perpetual
effort
to
conceal
the
squalid
background
of
what
was
meant
for
the
eyes
of
her
friends
and
neighbours
she
kept
only
two
servants
who
were
so
ill
paid
and
so
relentlessly
overworked
that
it
was
seldom
they
remained
with
her
for
more
than
three
months
in
dealings
with
other
people
whom
she
perforce
employed
she
was
often
guilty
of
incredible
meanness
as
for
instance
when
she
obliged
her
dressmaker
to
purchase
material
for
her
and
then
postponed
payment
alike
for
that
and
for
the
work
itself
to
the
last
possible
moment
this
was
not
heartlessness
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
the
woman
not
only
knew
that
her
behaviour
was
shameful
she
was
in
truth
ashamed
of
it
and
sorry
for
her
victims
but
life
was
a
battle
she
must
either
crush
or
be
crushed
with
sufficient
means
she
would
have
defrauded
no
one
and
would
have
behaved
generously
to
many
with
barely
enough
for
her
needs
she
set
her
face
and
defied
her
feelings
inasmuch
as
she
believed
there
was
no
choice
she
would
shed
tears
over
a
pitiful
story
of
want
and
without
shadow
of
hypocrisy
it
was
hard
it
was
cruel
such
things
oughtn
t
to
be
allowed
in
a
world
where
there
were
so
many
rich
people
the
next
day
she
would
argue
with
her
charwoman
about
halfpence
and
end
by
paying
the
poor
creature
what
she
knew
was
inadequate
and
unjust
for
the
simplest
reason
she
hadn
t
more
to
give
without
submitting
to
privations
which
she
considered
intolerable
but
whilst
she
could
be
a
positive
hyena
to
strangers
to
those
who
were
akin
to
her
and
those
of
whom
she
was
fond
her
affectionate
kindness
was
remarkable
one
observes
this
peculiarity
often
enough
it
reminds
one
how
savage
the
social
conflict
is
in
which
those
little
groups
of
people
stand
serried
against
their
common
enemies
relentless
to
all
others
among
themselves
only
the
more
tender
and
zealous
because
of
the
danger
no
mother
was
ever
more
devoted
her
son
a
gentleman
of
quite
noteworthy
selfishness
had
board
and
lodging
beneath
her
roof
on
nominal
terms
and
under
no
stress
of
pecuniary
trouble
had
mrs
yule
called
upon
him
to
make
the
slightest
sacrifice
on
her
behalf
her
daughter
she
loved
with
profound
tenderness
and
had
no
will
that
was
opposed
to
amy
s
and
it
was
characteristic
of
her
that
her
children
were
never
allowed
to
understand
of
what
baseness
she
often
became
guilty
in
the
determination
to
support
appearances
john
yule
naturally
suspected
what
went
on
behind
the
scenes
on
one
occasion
since
amy
s
marriage
he
had
involuntarily
overheard
a
dialogue
between
his
mother
and
a
servant
on
the
point
of
departing
which
made
even
him
feel
ashamed
but
from
amy
every
paltriness
and
meanness
had
always
been
concealed
with
the
utmost
care
mrs
yule
did
not
scruple
to
lie
heroically
when
in
danger
of
being
detected
by
her
daughter
yet
this
energetic
lady
had
no
social
ambitions
that
pointed
above
her
own
stratum
she
did
not
aim
at
intimacy
with
her
superiors
merely
at
superiority
among
her
intimates
her
circle
was
not
large
but
in
that
circle
she
must
be
regarded
with
the
respect
due
to
a
woman
of
refined
tastes
and
personal
distinction
her
little
dinners
might
be
of
rare
occurrence
but
to
be
invited
must
be
felt
a
privilege
mrs
edmund
yule
must
sound
well
on
people
s
lips
never
be
the
occasion
of
those
peculiar
smiles
which
she
herself
was
rather
fond
of
indulging
at
the
mention
of
other
people
s
names
the
question
of
amy
s
marriage
had
been
her
constant
thought
from
the
time
when
the
little
girl
shot
into
a
woman
grown
for
amy
no
common
match
no
acceptance
of
a
husband
merely
for
money
or
position
few
men
who
walked
the
earth
were
mates
for
amy
but
years
went
on
and
the
man
of
undeniable
distinction
did
not
yet
present
himself
suitors
offered
but
amy
smiled
coldly
at
their
addresses
in
private
not
seldom
scornfully
and
her
mother
though
growing
anxious
approved
then
of
a
sudden
appeared
edwin
reardon
a
literary
man
well
it
was
one
mode
of
distinction
happily
a
novelist
novelists
now
and
then
had
considerable
social
success
mr
reardon
it
was
true
did
not
impress
one
as
a
man
likely
to
push
forward
where
the
battle
called
for
rude
vigour
but
amy
soon
assured
herself
that
he
would
have
a
reputation
far
other
than
that
of
the
average
successful
storyteller
the
best
people
would
regard
him
he
would
be
welcomed
in
the
penetralia
of
culture
superior
persons
would
say
oh
i
don
t
read
novels
as
a
rule
but
of
course
mr
reardon
s
if
that
really
were
to
be
the
case
all
was
well
for
mrs
yule
could
appreciate
social
and
intellectual
differences
alas
alas
what
was
the
end
of
those
shining
anticipations
first
of
all
mrs
yule
began
to
make
less
frequent
mention
of
my
mr
edwin
next
she
never
uttered
his
name
save
when
inquiries
necessitated
it
then
the
most
intimate
of
her
intimates
received
little
hints
which
were
not
quite
easy
to
interpret
mr
reardon
is
growing
so
very
eccentric
has
an
odd
distaste
for
society
occupies
himself
with
all
sorts
of
interests
no
i
m
afraid
we
shan
t
have
another
of
his
novels
for
some
time
i
think
he
writes
anonymously
a
good
deal
and
really
such
curious
eccentricities
many
were
the
tears
she
wept
after
her
depressing
colloquies
with
amy
and
as
was
to
be
expected
she
thought
severely
of
the
cause
of
these
sorrows
on
the
last
occasion
when
he
came
to
her
house
she
received
him
with
such
extreme
civility
that
reardon
thenceforth
disliked
her
whereas
before
he
had
only
thought
her
a
and
silly
woman
alas
for
amy
s
marriage
with
a
man
of
distinction
from
step
to
step
of
descent
till
here
was
downright
catastrophe
bitter
enough
in
itself
but
most
lamentable
with
reference
to
the
friends
of
the
family
how
was
it
to
be
explained
this
return
of
amy
to
her
home
for
several
months
whilst
her
husband
was
no
further
away
than
worthing
the
bald
horrible
truth
impossible
yet
mr
milvain
knew
it
and
the
carters
must
guess
it
what
colour
could
be
thrown
upon
such
vulgar
distress
the
worst
was
not
yet
it
declared
itself
this
may
morning
when
quite
unexpectedly
a
cab
drove
up
to
the
house
bringing
amy
and
her
child
and
her
trunks
and
her
and
her
from
the
window
mrs
yule
was
aware
of
this
arrival
and
in
a
few
moments
she
learnt
the
unspeakable
cause
she
burst
into
tears
genuine
as
ever
woman
shed
there
s
no
use
in
that
mother
said
amy
whose
temper
was
in
a
dangerous
state
nothing
worse
can
happen
that
s
one
oh
it
s
disgraceful
disgraceful
sobbed
mrs
yule
what
we
are
to
say
i
can
not
i
shall
say
nothing
whatever
people
can
scarcely
have
the
impertinence
to
ask
us
questions
when
we
have
shown
that
they
are
but
there
are
some
people
i
can
t
help
giving
some
explanation
to
my
dear
child
he
is
not
in
his
right
mind
i
m
convinced
of
it
there
he
is
not
in
his
right
that
s
nonsense
mother
he
is
as
sane
as
i
but
you
have
often
said
what
strange
things
he
says
and
does
you
know
you
have
amy
that
talking
in
his
sleep
i
ve
thought
a
great
deal
of
it
since
you
told
me
about
that
and
and
so
many
other
things
my
love
i
shall
give
it
to
be
understood
that
he
has
become
so
very
odd
in
his
ways
that
i
can
t
have
that
replied
amy
with
decision
don
t
you
see
that
in
that
case
i
should
be
behaving
very
badly
i
can
t
see
that
at
all
there
are
many
reasons
as
you
know
very
well
why
one
shouldn
t
live
with
a
husband
who
is
at
all
suspected
of
mental
derangement
you
have
done
your
utmost
for
him
and
this
would
be
some
sort
of
explanation
you
know
i
am
so
convinced
that
there
is
truth
in
it
of
course
i
can
t
prevent
you
from
saying
what
you
like
but
i
think
it
would
be
very
wrong
to
start
a
rumour
of
this
there
was
less
resolve
in
this
utterance
amy
mused
and
looked
wretched
come
up
to
the
dear
said
her
mother
for
they
had
held
their
conversation
in
the
room
nearest
to
the
what
a
state
your
mind
must
be
in
oh
dear
oh
dear
she
was
a
slender
woman
still
pretty
in
face
and
dressed
in
a
way
that
emphasised
her
abiding
charms
her
voice
had
something
of
plaintiveness
and
altogether
she
was
of
frailer
type
than
her
daughter
is
my
room
ready
amy
inquired
on
the
stairs
i
m
sorry
to
say
it
isn
t
dear
as
i
didn
t
expect
you
till
tomorrow
but
it
shall
be
seen
to
this
addition
to
the
household
was
destined
to
cause
grave
difficulties
with
the
domestic
slaves
but
mrs
yule
would
prove
equal
to
the
occasion
on
amy
s
behalf
she
would
have
worked
her
servants
till
they
perished
of
exhaustion
before
her
eyes
use
my
room
for
the
present
she
added
i
think
the
girl
has
finished
up
there
but
wait
here
i
ll
just
go
and
see
to
things
were
not
quite
satisfactory
as
it
proved
you
should
have
heard
the
change
that
came
in
that
sweetly
plaintive
voice
when
it
addressed
the
luckless
housemaid
it
was
not
brutal
not
at
all
but
so
sharp
hard
unrelenting
the
voice
of
the
goddess
poverty
herself
perhaps
sounds
like
that
mad
was
he
to
be
spoken
of
in
a
low
voice
and
with
finger
pointing
to
the
forehead
there
was
something
ridiculous
as
well
as
repugnant
in
such
a
thought
but
it
kept
possession
of
amy
s
mind
she
was
brooding
upon
it
when
her
mother
came
into
the
and
he
positively
refused
to
carry
out
the
former
plan
refused
said
it
was
how
could
it
be
useless
there
s
something
so
unaccountable
in
his
i
don
t
think
it
unaccountable
replied
amy
it
s
weak
and
selfish
that
s
all
he
takes
the
first
miserable
employment
that
offers
rather
than
face
the
hard
work
of
writing
another
she
was
quite
aware
that
this
did
not
truly
represent
her
husband
s
position
but
an
uneasiness
of
conscience
impelled
her
to
harsh
speech
but
just
fancy
exclaimed
her
mother
what
can
he
mean
by
asking
you
to
go
and
live
with
him
on
shillings
a
week
upon
my
word
if
his
mind
isn
t
disordered
he
must
have
made
a
deliberate
plan
to
get
rid
of
amy
shook
her
head
you
mean
asked
mrs
yule
that
he
really
thinks
it
possible
for
all
of
you
to
be
supported
on
those
wages
the
last
word
was
chosen
to
express
the
utmost
scorn
he
talked
of
earning
fifty
pounds
a
year
by
even
then
it
could
only
make
about
a
hundred
a
year
my
dear
child
it
s
one
of
two
things
either
he
is
out
of
his
mind
or
he
has
purposely
cast
you
amy
laughed
thinking
of
her
husband
in
the
light
of
the
latter
alternative
there
s
no
need
to
seek
so
far
for
explanations
she
said
he
has
failed
that
s
all
just
like
a
man
might
fail
in
any
other
business
he
can
t
write
like
he
used
to
it
may
be
all
the
result
of
i
don
t
know
his
last
book
you
see
is
positively
refused
he
has
made
up
his
mind
that
there
s
nothing
but
poverty
before
him
and
he
can
t
understand
why
i
should
object
to
live
like
the
wife
of
a
well
i
only
know
that
he
has
placed
you
in
an
exceedingly
difficult
position
if
he
had
gone
away
to
worthing
for
the
summer
we
might
have
made
it
seem
natural
people
are
always
ready
to
allow
literary
men
to
do
rather
odd
things
up
to
a
certain
point
we
should
have
behaved
as
if
there
were
nothing
that
called
for
explanation
but
what
are
we
to
do
now
like
her
multitudinous
kind
mrs
yule
lived
only
in
the
opinions
of
other
people
what
others
would
say
was
her
ceaseless
preoccupation
she
had
never
conceived
of
life
as
something
proper
to
the
individual
independence
in
the
directing
of
one
s
course
seemed
to
her
only
possible
in
the
case
of
very
eccentric
persons
or
of
such
as
were
altogether
out
of
society
amy
had
advanced
intellectually
far
beyond
this
standpoint
but
lack
of
courage
disabled
her
from
acting
upon
her
convictions
people
must
know
the
truth
i
suppose
she
answered
dispiritedly
now
confession
of
the
truth
was
the
last
thing
that
would
occur
to
mrs
yule
when
social
relations
were
concerned
her
whole
existence
was
based
on
bold
denial
of
actualities
and
as
is
natural
in
such
persons
she
had
the
ostrich
instinct
strongly
developed
though
very
acute
in
the
discovery
of
her
friends
shams
and
lies
she
deceived
herself
ludicrously
in
the
matter
of
concealing
her
own
embarrassments
but
the
fact
is
my
dear
she
answered
we
don
t
know
the
truth
ourselves
you
had
better
let
yourself
be
directed
by
me
it
will
be
better
at
first
if
you
see
as
few
people
as
possible
i
suppose
you
must
say
something
or
other
to
two
or
three
of
your
own
friends
if
you
take
my
advice
you
ll
be
rather
mysterious
let
them
think
what
they
like
anything
is
better
than
to
say
plainly
my
husband
can
t
support
me
and
he
has
gone
to
work
as
a
clerk
for
weekly
be
mysterious
darling
depend
upon
it
that
s
the
the
conversation
was
pursued
with
brief
intervals
all
through
the
day
in
the
afternoon
two
ladies
paid
a
call
but
amy
kept
out
of
sight
between
six
and
seven
john
yule
returned
from
his
gentlemanly
occupations
as
he
was
generally
in
a
touchy
temper
before
dinner
had
soothed
him
nothing
was
said
to
him
of
the
latest
development
of
his
sister
s
affairs
until
late
in
the
evening
he
was
allowed
to
suppose
that
reardon
s
departure
for
the
seaside
had
taken
place
a
day
sooner
than
had
been
arranged
behind
the
was
a
comfortable
little
chamber
set
apart
as
john
s
sanctum
here
he
smoked
and
entertained
his
male
friends
and
contemplated
the
portraits
of
those
female
ones
who
would
not
have
been
altogether
at
their
ease
in
mrs
yule
s
not
long
after
dinner
his
mother
and
sister
came
to
talk
with
him
in
this
retreat
with
some
nervousness
mrs
yule
made
known
to
him
what
had
taken
place
amy
the
while
stood
by
the
table
and
glanced
over
a
magazine
that
she
had
picked
up
well
i
see
nothing
to
be
surprised
at
was
john
s
first
remark
it
was
pretty
certain
he
d
come
to
this
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
long
are
we
to
be
at
the
expense
of
supporting
amy
and
her
youngster
this
was
practical
and
just
what
mrs
yule
had
expected
from
her
son
we
can
t
consider
such
things
as
that
she
replied
you
don
t
wish
i
suppose
that
amy
should
go
and
live
in
a
back
street
at
islington
and
be
hungry
every
other
day
and
soon
have
no
decent
clothes
i
don
t
think
jack
would
be
greatly
distressed
amy
put
in
quietly
this
is
a
woman
s
way
of
talking
replied
john
i
want
to
know
what
is
to
be
the
end
of
it
all
i
ve
no
doubt
it
s
uncommonly
pleasant
for
reardon
to
shift
his
responsibilities
on
to
our
shoulders
at
this
rate
i
think
i
shall
get
married
and
live
beyond
my
means
until
i
can
hold
out
no
longer
and
then
hand
my
wife
over
to
her
relatives
with
my
compliments
it
s
about
the
coolest
business
that
ever
came
under
my
but
what
is
to
be
done
asked
mrs
yule
it
s
no
use
talking
sarcastically
john
or
making
yourself
we
are
not
called
upon
to
find
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
reardon
must
get
a
decent
berth
somebody
or
other
must
pitch
him
into
the
kind
of
place
that
suits
men
who
can
do
nothing
in
particular
carter
ought
to
be
able
to
help
i
should
you
know
very
well
said
amy
that
places
of
that
kind
are
not
to
be
had
for
the
asking
it
may
be
years
before
any
such
opportunity
confound
the
fellow
why
the
deuce
doesn
t
he
go
on
with
his
there
s
plenty
of
money
to
be
made
out
of
but
he
can
t
write
jack
he
has
lost
his
that
s
all
bosh
amy
if
a
fellow
has
once
got
into
the
swing
of
it
he
can
keep
it
up
if
he
likes
he
might
write
his
two
novels
a
year
easily
enough
just
like
twenty
other
men
and
women
look
here
i
could
do
it
myself
if
i
weren
t
too
lazy
and
that
s
what
s
the
matter
with
reardon
he
doesn
t
care
to
i
have
thought
that
myself
observed
mrs
yule
it
really
is
too
ridiculous
to
say
that
he
couldn
t
write
some
kind
of
novels
if
he
chose
look
at
miss
blunt
s
last
book
why
anybody
could
have
written
that
i
m
sure
there
isn
t
a
thing
in
it
i
couldn
t
have
imagined
well
all
i
want
to
know
is
what
s
amy
going
to
do
if
things
don
t
alter
she
shall
never
want
a
home
as
long
as
i
have
one
to
share
with
john
s
natural
procedure
when
beset
by
difficulties
was
to
find
fault
with
everyone
all
round
himself
maintaining
a
position
of
irresponsibility
it
s
all
very
well
mother
but
when
a
girl
gets
married
she
takes
her
husband
i
have
always
understood
for
better
or
worse
just
as
a
man
takes
his
wife
to
tell
the
truth
it
seems
to
me
amy
has
put
herself
in
the
wrong
it
s
deuced
unpleasant
to
go
and
live
in
back
streets
and
to
go
without
dinner
now
and
then
but
girls
mustn
t
marry
if
they
re
afraid
to
face
these
don
t
talk
so
monstrously
john
exclaimed
his
mother
how
could
amy
possibly
foresee
such
things
the
case
is
quite
an
extraordinary
not
so
uncommon
i
assure
you
some
one
was
telling
me
the
other
day
of
a
married
lady
well
educated
and
blameless
who
goes
to
work
at
a
shop
somewhere
or
other
because
her
husband
can
t
support
and
you
wish
to
see
amy
working
in
a
shop
no
i
can
t
say
i
do
i
m
only
telling
you
that
her
bad
luck
isn
t
unexampled
it
s
very
fortunate
for
her
that
she
has
amy
had
taken
a
seat
apart
she
sat
with
her
head
leaning
on
her
hand
why
don
t
you
go
and
see
reardon
john
asked
of
his
mother
what
would
be
the
use
perhaps
he
would
tell
me
to
mind
my
own
by
jingo
precisely
what
you
would
be
doing
i
think
you
ought
to
see
him
and
give
him
to
understand
that
he
s
behaving
in
a
confoundedly
ungentlemanly
way
evidently
he
s
the
kind
of
fellow
that
wants
stirring
up
i
ve
half
a
mind
to
go
and
see
him
myself
where
is
this
slum
that
he
s
gone
to
live
in
we
don
t
know
his
address
so
long
as
it
s
not
the
kind
of
place
where
one
would
be
afraid
of
catching
a
fever
i
think
it
wouldn
t
be
amiss
for
me
to
look
him
you
ll
do
no
good
by
that
said
amy
indifferently
confound
it
it
s
just
because
nobody
does
anything
that
things
have
come
to
this
pass
the
conversation
was
of
course
profitless
john
could
only
return
again
and
again
to
his
assertion
that
reardon
must
get
a
decent
at
length
amy
left
the
room
in
weariness
and
disgust
i
suppose
they
have
quarrelled
terrifically
said
her
brother
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
i
am
afraid
well
you
must
do
as
you
please
but
it
s
confounded
hard
lines
that
you
should
have
to
keep
her
and
the
kid
you
know
i
can
t
afford
to
my
dear
i
haven
t
asked
you
no
but
you
ll
have
the
devil
s
own
job
to
make
ends
meet
i
know
that
well
i
shall
manage
all
right
you
re
a
plucky
woman
but
it
s
too
bad
reardon
s
a
humbug
that
s
my
opinion
i
shall
have
a
talk
with
carter
about
him
i
suppose
he
has
transferred
all
their
furniture
to
the
slum
he
can
t
have
removed
yet
it
was
only
this
morning
that
he
went
to
search
for
oh
then
i
tell
you
what
it
is
i
shall
look
in
there
the
first
thing
morning
and
just
talk
to
him
in
a
fatherly
way
you
needn
t
say
anything
to
amy
but
i
see
he
s
just
the
kind
of
fellow
that
if
everyone
leaves
him
alone
he
ll
be
content
with
carter
s
shillings
for
the
rest
of
his
life
and
never
trouble
his
head
about
how
amy
is
to
this
proposal
mrs
yule
readily
assented
on
going
upstairs
she
found
that
amy
had
all
but
fallen
asleep
upon
a
settee
in
the
you
are
quite
worn
out
with
your
troubles
she
said
go
to
bed
and
have
a
good
long
yes
i
the
neat
fresh
bedchamber
seemed
to
amy
a
delightful
haven
of
rest
she
turned
the
key
in
the
door
with
an
enjoyment
of
the
privacy
thus
secured
such
as
she
had
never
known
in
her
life
for
in
maidenhood
safe
solitude
was
a
matter
of
course
to
her
and
since
marriage
she
had
not
passed
a
night
alone
willie
was
fast
asleep
in
a
little
bed
shadowed
by
her
own
in
an
impulse
of
maternal
love
and
gladness
she
bent
over
the
child
and
covered
his
face
with
kisses
too
gentle
to
awaken
him
how
clean
and
sweet
everything
was
it
is
often
said
by
people
who
are
exquisitely
ignorant
of
the
matter
that
cleanliness
is
a
luxury
within
reach
even
of
the
poorest
very
far
from
that
only
with
the
utmost
difficulty
with
wearisome
exertion
with
harassing
sacrifice
can
people
who
are
pinched
for
money
preserve
a
moderate
purity
in
their
persons
and
their
surroundings
by
painful
degrees
amy
had
accustomed
herself
to
compromises
in
this
particular
which
in
the
early
days
of
her
married
life
would
have
seemed
intensely
disagreeable
if
not
revolting
a
housewife
who
lives
in
the
country
and
has
but
a
patch
of
back
garden
or
even
a
kitchen
can
if
she
thinks
fit
take
her
place
at
the
and
relieve
her
mind
on
laundry
matters
but
to
the
inhabitant
of
a
miniature
flat
in
the
heart
of
london
anything
of
that
kind
is
out
of
the
question
when
amy
began
to
cut
down
her
laundress
s
bill
she
did
it
with
a
sense
of
degradation
one
grows
accustomed
however
to
such
unpleasant
necessities
and
already
she
had
learnt
what
was
the
minimum
of
expenditure
for
one
who
is
troubled
with
a
lady
s
instincts
no
no
cleanliness
is
a
costly
thing
and
a
troublesome
thing
when
appliances
and
means
have
to
be
improvised
it
was
in
part
the
understanding
she
had
gained
of
this
side
of
the
life
of
poverty
that
made
amy
shrink
in
dread
from
the
still
narrower
lodgings
to
which
reardon
invited
her
she
knew
how
subtly
one
s
can
be
undermined
by
sordid
conditions
the
difference
between
the
life
of
educated
people
and
that
of
the
uneducated
poor
is
not
greater
in
visible
details
than
in
the
minutiae
of
privacy
and
amy
must
have
submitted
to
an
extraordinary
change
before
it
would
have
been
possible
for
her
to
live
at
ease
in
the
circumstances
which
satisfy
a
decent
woman
she
was
prepared
for
final
parting
from
her
husband
rather
than
try
to
effect
that
change
in
herself
she
undressed
at
leisure
and
stretched
her
limbs
in
the
cold
soft
fragrant
bed
a
sigh
of
profound
relief
escaped
her
how
good
it
was
to
be
alone
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
was
sleeping
as
peacefully
as
the
child
who
shared
her
room
at
breakfast
in
the
morning
she
showed
a
bright
almost
a
happy
face
it
was
long
long
since
she
had
enjoyed
such
a
night
s
rest
so
undisturbed
with
unwelcome
thoughts
on
the
threshold
of
sleep
and
on
awaking
her
life
was
perhaps
wrecked
but
the
thought
of
that
did
not
press
upon
her
for
the
present
she
must
enjoy
her
freedom
it
was
like
a
recovery
of
girlhood
there
are
few
married
women
who
would
not
sooner
or
later
accept
with
joy
the
offer
of
some
months
of
a
maidenly
liberty
amy
would
not
allow
herself
to
think
that
her
wedded
life
was
at
an
end
with
a
woman
s
strange
faculty
of
closing
her
eyes
against
facts
that
do
not
immediately
concern
her
she
tasted
the
relief
of
the
present
and
let
the
future
lie
unregarded
reardon
would
get
out
of
his
difficulties
sooner
or
later
somebody
or
other
would
help
him
that
was
the
dim
background
of
her
agreeable
sensations
he
suffered
no
doubt
but
then
it
was
just
as
well
that
he
should
suffering
would
perhaps
impel
him
to
effort
when
he
communicated
to
her
his
new
address
he
could
scarcely
neglect
to
do
that
she
would
send
a
not
unfriendly
letter
and
hint
to
him
that
now
was
his
opportunity
for
writing
a
book
as
good
a
book
as
those
which
formerly
issued
from
his
if
he
found
that
literature
was
in
truth
a
thing
of
the
past
with
him
then
he
must
exert
himself
to
obtain
a
position
worthy
of
an
educated
man
yes
in
this
way
she
would
write
to
him
without
a
word
that
could
hurt
or
offend
she
ate
an
excellent
breakfast
and
made
known
her
enjoyment
of
it
i
am
so
glad
replied
her
mother
you
have
been
getting
quite
thin
and
quite
consumptive
remarked
john
looking
up
from
his
newspaper
shall
i
make
arrangements
for
a
daily
landau
at
the
livery
stables
round
here
you
can
if
you
like
replied
his
sister
it
would
do
both
mother
and
me
good
and
i
have
no
doubt
you
could
afford
it
quite
oh
indeed
you
re
a
remarkable
young
woman
let
me
tell
you
i
suppose
your
husband
is
breakfasting
on
bread
and
water
i
hope
not
and
i
don
t
think
it
very
jack
jack
interposed
mrs
yule
softly
her
son
resumed
his
paper
and
at
the
end
of
the
meal
rose
with
an
unwonted
briskness
to
make
his
preparations
for
departure
chapter
xix
the
past
revived
nor
would
it
be
true
to
represent
edwin
reardon
as
rising
to
the
new
day
wholly
disconsolate
he
too
had
slept
unusually
well
and
with
returning
consciousness
the
sense
of
a
burden
removed
was
more
instant
than
that
of
his
loss
and
all
the
dreary
circumstances
attaching
to
it
he
had
no
longer
to
fear
the
effects
upon
amy
of
such
a
grievous
change
as
from
their
homelike
flat
to
the
couple
of
rooms
he
had
taken
in
islington
for
the
moment
this
relief
helped
him
to
bear
the
pain
of
all
that
had
happened
and
the
uneasiness
which
troubled
him
when
he
reflected
that
his
wife
was
henceforth
a
charge
to
her
mother
of
course
for
the
moment
only
he
had
no
sooner
begun
to
move
about
to
prepare
his
breakfast
amid
the
relics
of
last
evening
s
meal
to
think
of
all
the
detestable
work
he
had
to
do
before
night
than
his
heart
sank
again
his
position
was
as
dolorous
as
that
of
any
man
who
awoke
that
morning
to
the
brutal
realities
of
life
if
only
for
the
shame
of
it
how
must
they
be
speaking
of
him
amy
s
relatives
and
her
friends
a
novelist
who
couldn
t
write
novels
a
husband
who
couldn
t
support
his
wife
and
child
a
literate
who
made
eager
application
for
illiterate
work
at
paltry
wages
how
interesting
it
would
all
sound
in
humorous
gossip
and
what
hope
had
he
that
things
would
ever
be
better
with
him
had
he
done
well
had
he
done
wisely
would
it
not
have
been
better
to
have
made
that
one
last
effort
there
came
before
him
a
vision
of
quiet
nooks
beneath
the
sussex
cliffs
of
the
long
lines
of
green
breakers
bursting
into
foam
he
heard
the
and
tasted
the
briny
freshness
of
the
inspiration
after
all
would
perchance
have
come
to
him
if
amy
s
love
had
but
been
of
more
enduring
quality
if
she
had
strengthened
him
for
this
last
endeavour
with
the
brave
tenderness
of
an
ideal
wife
but
he
had
seen
such
hateful
things
in
her
eyes
her
love
was
dead
and
she
regarded
him
as
the
man
who
had
spoilt
her
hopes
of
happiness
it
was
only
for
her
own
sake
that
she
urged
him
to
strive
on
let
his
be
the
toil
that
hers
might
be
the
advantage
if
he
succeeded
she
would
be
glad
if
i
were
dead
she
would
be
he
had
the
conviction
of
it
oh
yes
she
would
shed
tears
they
come
so
easily
to
women
but
to
have
him
dead
and
out
of
her
way
to
be
saved
from
her
anomalous
position
to
see
once
more
a
chance
in
life
she
would
welcome
it
but
there
was
no
time
for
brooding
he
had
to
sell
all
the
things
that
were
superfluous
and
to
make
arrangements
for
the
removal
of
his
effects
by
wednesday
night
in
accordance
with
his
agreement
the
flat
must
be
free
for
the
new
occupier
he
had
taken
only
two
rooms
and
fortunately
as
things
were
three
would
have
cost
more
than
he
was
likely
to
be
able
to
afford
for
a
long
time
the
rent
of
the
two
was
to
be
and
how
if
amy
had
consented
to
come
could
he
have
met
the
expenses
of
their
living
out
of
his
weekly
shillings
how
could
he
have
pretended
to
do
literary
work
in
such
cramped
quarters
he
who
had
never
been
able
to
write
a
line
save
in
strict
seclusion
in
his
despair
he
had
faced
the
impossible
amy
had
shown
more
wisdom
though
in
a
spirit
of
unkindness
towards
ten
o
clock
he
was
leaving
the
flat
to
go
and
find
people
who
would
purchase
his
books
and
old
clothing
and
other
superfluities
but
before
he
could
close
the
door
behind
him
an
approaching
step
on
the
stairs
caught
his
attention
he
saw
the
shining
silk
hat
of
a
gentleman
it
was
john
yule
ha
john
exclaimed
looking
up
a
minute
or
two
and
i
should
have
been
too
late
i
he
spoke
in
quite
a
friendly
way
and
on
reaching
the
landing
shook
hands
are
you
obliged
to
go
at
once
or
could
i
have
a
word
with
you
come
they
entered
the
study
which
was
in
some
disorder
reardon
made
no
reference
to
circumstances
but
offered
a
chair
and
seated
himself
have
a
cigarette
said
yule
holding
out
a
box
of
them
no
thank
you
i
don
t
smoke
so
then
i
ll
light
one
myself
it
always
makes
talk
easier
to
me
you
re
on
the
point
of
moving
i
suppose
yes
i
reardon
tried
to
speak
in
quite
a
simple
way
with
no
admission
of
embarrassment
he
was
not
successful
and
to
his
visitor
the
tone
seemed
rather
offensive
i
suppose
you
ll
let
amy
know
your
new
address
certainly
why
should
i
conceal
it
no
no
i
didn
t
mean
to
suggest
that
but
you
might
be
taking
it
for
granted
that
that
the
rupture
was
final
i
there
had
never
been
any
intimacy
between
these
two
men
reardon
regarded
his
wife
s
brother
as
rather
snobbish
and
disagreeably
selfish
john
yule
looked
upon
the
novelist
as
a
prig
and
now
of
late
as
a
shuffling
untrustworthy
fellow
it
appeared
to
john
that
his
was
assuming
a
manner
wholly
unjustifiable
and
he
had
a
difficulty
in
behaving
to
him
with
courtesy
reardon
on
the
other
hand
felt
injured
by
the
turn
his
visitor
s
remarks
were
taking
and
began
to
resent
the
visit
altogether
i
take
nothing
for
granted
he
said
coldly
but
i
m
afraid
nothing
is
to
be
gained
by
a
discussion
of
our
difficulties
the
time
for
that
is
over
i
can
t
quite
see
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
time
has
just
please
tell
me
to
begin
with
do
you
come
on
amy
s
behalf
in
a
way
yes
she
hasn
t
sent
me
but
my
mother
and
i
are
so
astonished
at
what
is
happening
that
it
was
necessary
for
one
or
other
of
us
to
see
i
think
it
is
all
between
amy
and
difficulties
between
husband
and
wife
are
generally
best
left
to
the
people
themselves
i
know
but
the
fact
is
there
are
peculiar
circumstances
in
the
present
case
it
can
t
be
necessary
for
me
to
explain
reardon
could
find
no
suitable
words
of
reply
he
understood
what
yule
referred
to
and
began
to
feel
the
full
extent
of
his
humiliation
you
mean
of
course
he
began
but
his
tongue
failed
him
well
we
should
really
like
to
know
how
long
it
is
proposed
that
amy
shall
remain
with
her
john
was
perfectly
it
took
much
to
disturb
his
equanimity
he
smoked
his
cigarette
which
was
in
an
amber
mouthpiece
and
seemed
to
enjoy
its
flavour
reardon
found
himself
observing
the
perfection
of
the
young
man
s
boots
and
trousers
that
depends
entirely
on
my
wife
herself
he
replied
mechanically
how
so
i
offer
her
the
best
home
i
reardon
felt
himself
a
poor
pitiful
creature
and
hated
the
man
who
made
him
feel
so
but
really
reardon
began
the
other
uncrossing
and
recrossing
his
legs
do
you
tell
me
in
seriousness
that
you
expect
amy
to
live
in
such
lodgings
as
you
can
afford
on
a
pound
a
week
i
don
t
i
said
that
i
had
offered
her
the
best
home
i
could
i
know
it
s
impossible
of
either
he
must
speak
thus
or
break
into
senseless
wrath
it
was
hard
to
hold
back
the
angry
words
that
were
on
his
lips
but
he
succeeded
and
he
was
glad
he
had
done
so
then
it
doesn
t
depend
on
amy
said
john
i
suppose
you
see
no
reason
then
why
she
shouldn
t
live
as
at
present
for
an
indefinite
time
to
john
whose
perspicacity
was
not
remarkable
reardon
s
changed
tone
conveyed
simply
an
impression
of
bland
impudence
he
eyed
his
rather
haughtily
i
can
only
say
returned
the
other
who
was
become
wearily
indifferent
that
as
soon
as
i
can
afford
a
decent
home
i
shall
give
my
wife
the
opportunity
of
returning
to
but
pray
when
is
that
likely
to
be
john
had
passed
the
bounds
his
manner
was
too
frankly
contemptuous
i
see
no
right
you
have
to
examine
me
in
this
fashion
reardon
exclaimed
with
mrs
yule
i
should
have
done
my
best
to
be
patient
if
she
had
asked
these
questions
but
you
are
not
justified
in
putting
them
at
all
events
not
in
this
i
m
very
sorry
you
speak
like
this
reardon
said
the
other
with
calm
insolence
it
confirms
unpleasant
ideas
you
what
do
you
mean
why
one
can
t
help
thinking
that
you
are
rather
too
much
at
your
ease
under
the
circumstances
it
isn
t
exactly
an
everyday
thing
you
know
for
a
man
s
wife
to
be
sent
back
to
her
own
people
reardon
could
not
endure
the
sound
of
these
words
he
interrupted
hotly
i
can
t
discuss
it
with
you
you
are
utterly
unable
to
comprehend
me
and
my
position
utterly
it
would
be
useless
to
defend
myself
you
must
take
whatever
view
seems
to
you
the
natural
john
having
finished
his
cigarette
rose
the
natural
view
is
an
uncommonly
disagreeable
one
he
said
however
i
have
no
intention
of
quarrelling
with
you
i
ll
only
just
say
that
as
i
take
a
share
in
the
expenses
of
my
mother
s
house
this
question
decidedly
concerns
me
and
i
ll
add
that
i
think
it
ought
to
concern
you
a
good
deal
more
than
it
seems
reardon
ashamed
already
of
his
violence
paused
upon
these
remarks
it
shall
he
uttered
at
length
coldly
you
have
put
it
clearly
enough
to
me
and
you
shan
t
have
spoken
in
vain
is
there
anything
else
you
wish
to
say
thank
you
i
think
they
parted
with
distant
civility
and
reardon
closed
the
door
behind
his
visitor
he
knew
that
his
character
was
seen
through
a
distorting
medium
by
amy
s
relatives
to
some
extent
by
amy
herself
but
hitherto
the
reflection
that
this
must
always
be
the
case
when
a
man
of
his
kind
is
judged
by
people
of
the
world
had
strengthened
him
in
defiance
an
endeavour
to
explain
himself
would
be
maddeningly
hopeless
even
amy
did
not
understand
aright
the
troubles
through
which
his
intellectual
and
moral
nature
was
passing
and
to
speak
of
such
experiences
to
mrs
yule
or
to
john
would
be
equivalent
to
addressing
them
in
alien
tongues
he
and
they
had
no
common
criterion
by
reference
to
which
he
could
make
himself
intelligible
the
practical
tone
in
which
john
had
explained
the
opposing
view
of
the
situation
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
proceed
as
he
had
purposed
amy
would
never
come
to
him
in
his
poor
lodgings
her
mother
her
brother
all
her
advisers
would
regard
such
a
thing
as
out
of
the
question
very
well
recognising
this
he
must
also
recognise
his
wife
s
claim
upon
him
for
material
support
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
supply
her
with
means
sufficient
to
live
upon
but
what
he
could
afford
she
should
have
when
he
went
out
it
was
with
a
different
purpose
from
that
of
half
an
hour
ago
after
a
short
search
in
the
direction
of
edgware
road
he
found
a
dealer
in
furniture
whom
he
requested
to
come
as
soon
as
possible
to
the
flat
on
a
matter
of
business
an
hour
later
the
man
kept
his
appointment
having
brought
him
into
the
study
reardon
said
i
wish
to
sell
everything
in
this
flat
with
a
few
exceptions
that
i
ll
point
out
to
you
very
good
sir
was
the
reply
let
s
have
a
look
through
the
that
the
price
offered
would
be
strictly
a
minimum
reardon
knew
well
enough
the
dealer
was
a
rough
and
rather
dirty
fellow
with
the
distrustful
glance
which
distinguishes
his
class
men
of
reardon
s
type
when
hapless
enough
to
be
forced
into
vulgar
commerce
are
doubly
at
a
disadvantage
not
only
their
ignorance
but
their
sensitiveness
makes
them
ready
victims
of
even
the
least
subtle
man
of
business
to
deal
on
equal
terms
with
a
person
you
must
be
able
to
assert
with
calm
confidence
that
you
are
not
to
be
cheated
reardon
was
too
well
aware
that
he
would
certainly
be
cheated
and
shrank
scornfully
from
the
higgling
of
the
market
moreover
he
was
in
a
state
of
mind
and
cared
for
little
but
to
be
done
with
the
hateful
details
of
this
process
of
ruin
he
pencilled
a
list
of
the
articles
he
must
retain
for
his
own
use
it
would
of
course
be
cheaper
to
take
a
bare
room
than
furnished
lodgings
and
every
penny
he
could
save
was
of
importance
to
him
the
with
necessary
linen
and
blankets
a
table
two
chairs
a
strictly
the
indispensable
things
no
need
to
complete
the
list
then
there
were
a
few
valuable
which
belonged
rather
to
amy
than
to
him
these
he
would
get
packed
and
send
to
westbourne
park
the
dealer
made
his
calculation
with
many
at
the
vendor
and
what
may
you
ask
for
the
lot
please
to
make
an
most
of
the
things
has
had
a
good
deal
of
wear
i
know
i
know
just
let
me
hear
what
you
will
well
if
you
want
a
valuation
i
say
eighteen
pound
it
was
more
than
reardon
had
expected
though
much
less
than
a
man
who
understood
such
affairs
would
have
obtained
that
s
the
most
you
can
give
wouldn
t
pay
me
to
give
a
sixpence
more
you
see
he
began
to
point
out
defects
but
reardon
cut
him
short
can
you
take
them
away
at
once
at
wunst
would
two
o
clock
do
yes
it
and
might
you
want
these
other
things
takin
anywheres
yes
but
not
till
they
have
to
go
to
islington
what
would
you
do
it
for
this
bargain
also
was
completed
and
the
dealer
went
his
way
thereupon
reardon
set
to
work
to
dispose
of
his
books
by
one
he
had
sold
them
for
a
couple
of
guineas
at
two
came
the
cart
that
was
to
take
away
the
furniture
and
at
four
o
clock
nothing
remained
in
the
flat
save
what
had
to
be
removed
on
the
morrow
the
next
thing
to
be
done
was
to
go
to
islington
forfeit
a
week
s
rent
for
the
two
rooms
he
had
taken
and
find
a
single
room
at
the
lowest
possible
cost
on
the
way
he
entered
an
and
satisfied
his
hunger
for
he
had
had
nothing
since
breakfast
it
took
him
a
couple
of
hours
to
discover
the
ideal
garret
it
was
found
at
length
in
a
narrow
little
running
out
of
upper
street
the
rent
was
a
week
at
seven
o
clock
he
sat
down
in
what
once
was
called
his
study
and
wrote
the
following
letter
enclosed
in
this
envelope
you
will
find
twenty
pounds
i
have
been
reminded
that
your
relatives
will
be
at
the
expense
of
your
support
it
seemed
best
to
me
to
sell
the
furniture
and
now
i
send
you
all
the
money
i
can
spare
at
present
you
will
receive
a
box
containing
several
things
i
did
not
feel
justified
in
selling
as
soon
as
i
begin
to
have
my
payment
from
carter
half
of
it
shall
be
sent
to
you
every
week
my
address
is
manville
street
upper
street
edwin
he
enclosed
the
money
in
notes
and
gold
and
addressed
the
envelope
to
his
wife
she
must
receive
it
this
very
night
and
he
knew
not
how
to
ensure
that
save
by
delivering
it
himself
so
he
went
to
westbourne
park
by
train
and
walked
to
mrs
yule
s
house
at
this
hour
the
family
were
probably
at
dinner
yes
the
window
of
the
showed
lights
within
whilst
those
of
the
were
in
shadow
after
a
little
hesitation
he
rang
the
servants
bell
when
the
door
opened
he
handed
his
letter
to
the
girl
and
requested
that
it
might
be
given
to
mrs
reardon
as
soon
as
possible
with
one
more
hasty
glance
at
the
window
amy
was
perhaps
enjoying
her
unwonted
comfort
he
walked
quickly
away
as
he
what
had
been
his
home
its
bareness
made
his
heart
sink
an
hour
or
two
had
sufficed
for
this
devastation
nothing
remained
upon
the
uncarpeted
floors
but
the
needments
he
would
carry
with
him
into
the
wilderness
such
few
evidences
of
civilisation
as
the
poorest
can
not
well
dispense
with
anger
revolt
a
sense
of
outraged
love
all
manner
of
confused
passions
had
sustained
him
throughout
this
day
of
toil
now
he
had
leisure
to
know
how
faint
he
was
he
threw
himself
upon
his
and
lay
for
more
than
an
hour
in
torpor
of
body
and
mind
but
before
he
could
sleep
he
must
eat
though
it
was
cold
he
could
not
exert
himself
to
light
a
fire
there
was
some
food
still
in
the
cupboard
and
he
consumed
it
in
the
fashion
of
a
tired
labourer
with
the
plate
on
his
lap
using
his
fingers
and
a
knife
what
had
he
to
do
with
delicacies
he
felt
utterly
alone
in
the
world
unless
it
were
biffen
what
mortal
would
give
him
kindly
welcome
under
any
roof
these
stripped
rooms
were
symbolical
of
his
life
losing
money
he
had
lost
everything
be
thankful
that
you
exist
that
these
morsels
of
food
are
still
granted
you
man
has
a
right
to
nothing
in
this
world
that
he
can
not
pay
for
did
you
imagine
that
love
was
an
exception
foolish
idealist
love
is
one
of
the
first
things
to
be
frightened
away
by
poverty
go
and
live
upon
your
a
week
and
on
your
memories
of
the
in
this
room
he
had
sat
with
amy
on
their
return
from
the
wedding
holiday
shall
you
always
love
me
as
you
do
now
for
ever
for
ever
even
if
i
disappointed
you
if
i
failed
how
could
that
affect
my
love
the
voices
seemed
to
be
lingering
still
in
a
sad
faint
echo
so
short
a
time
it
was
since
those
words
were
uttered
his
own
fault
a
man
has
no
business
to
fail
least
of
all
can
he
expect
others
to
have
time
to
look
back
upon
him
or
pity
him
if
he
sink
under
the
stress
of
conflict
those
behind
will
trample
over
his
body
they
can
t
help
it
they
themselves
are
borne
onwards
by
resistless
pressure
he
slept
for
a
few
hours
then
lay
watching
the
light
of
dawn
as
it
revealed
his
desolation
the
morning
s
post
brought
him
a
large
heavy
envelope
the
aspect
of
which
for
a
moment
puzzled
him
but
he
recognised
the
handwriting
and
understood
the
editor
of
the
wayside
in
a
note
begged
to
return
the
paper
on
pliny
s
letters
which
had
recently
been
submitted
to
him
he
was
sorry
it
did
not
strike
him
as
quite
so
interesting
as
the
other
contributions
from
reardon
s
pen
this
was
a
trifle
for
the
first
time
he
received
a
rejected
piece
of
writing
without
distress
he
even
laughed
at
the
artistic
completeness
of
the
situation
the
money
would
have
been
welcome
but
on
that
very
account
he
might
have
known
it
would
not
come
the
cart
that
was
to
transfer
his
property
to
the
room
in
islington
arrived
about
by
that
time
he
had
dismissed
the
last
details
of
business
in
relation
to
the
flat
and
was
free
to
go
back
to
the
obscure
world
whence
he
had
risen
he
felt
that
for
two
years
and
a
half
he
had
been
a
pretender
it
was
not
natural
to
him
to
live
in
the
manner
of
people
who
enjoy
an
assured
income
he
belonged
to
the
class
of
casual
back
to
obscurity
carrying
a
bag
which
contained
a
few
things
best
kept
in
his
own
care
he
went
by
train
to
king
s
cross
and
thence
walked
up
pentonville
hill
to
upper
street
and
his
own
little
manville
street
was
not
unreasonably
squalid
the
house
in
which
he
had
found
a
home
was
not
alarming
in
its
appearance
and
the
woman
who
kept
it
had
an
honest
face
amy
would
have
shrunk
in
apprehension
but
to
one
who
had
experience
of
london
garrets
this
was
a
rather
favourable
specimen
of
its
kind
the
door
closed
more
satisfactorily
than
poor
biffen
s
for
instance
and
there
were
not
many
of
those
in
the
floor
which
gave
admission
to
piercing
little
draughts
not
a
pane
of
the
window
was
cracked
not
one
a
man
might
live
here
comfortably
could
memory
be
destroyed
there
s
a
letter
come
for
you
said
the
landlady
as
she
admitted
him
you
ll
find
it
on
your
he
ascended
hastily
the
letter
must
be
from
amy
as
no
one
else
knew
his
address
yes
and
its
contents
were
these
as
you
have
really
sold
the
furniture
i
shall
accept
half
this
money
that
you
send
i
must
buy
clothing
for
myself
and
willie
but
the
other
ten
pounds
i
shall
return
to
you
as
soon
as
possible
as
for
your
offer
of
half
what
you
are
to
receive
from
mr
carter
that
seems
to
me
ridiculous
in
any
case
i
can
not
take
it
if
you
seriously
abandon
all
further
hope
from
literature
i
think
it
is
your
duty
to
make
every
effort
to
obtain
a
position
suitable
to
a
man
of
your
amy
doubtless
amy
thought
it
was
her
duty
to
write
in
this
way
not
a
word
of
sympathy
he
must
understand
that
no
one
was
to
blame
but
himself
and
that
her
hardships
were
equal
to
his
own
in
the
bag
he
had
brought
with
him
there
were
writing
materials
standing
at
the
mantelpiece
he
forthwith
penned
a
reply
to
this
letter
the
money
is
for
your
support
as
far
as
it
will
go
if
it
comes
back
to
me
i
shall
send
it
again
if
you
refuse
to
make
use
of
it
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
put
it
aside
and
consider
it
as
belonging
to
willie
the
other
money
of
which
i
spoke
will
be
sent
to
you
once
a
month
as
our
concerns
are
no
longer
between
us
alone
i
must
protect
myself
against
anyone
who
would
be
likely
to
accuse
me
of
not
giving
you
what
i
could
afford
for
your
advice
i
thank
you
but
remember
that
in
withdrawing
from
me
your
affection
you
have
lost
all
right
to
offer
me
he
went
out
and
posted
this
at
once
by
three
o
clock
the
furniture
of
his
room
was
arranged
he
had
not
kept
a
carpet
that
was
luxury
and
beyond
his
due
his
score
of
volumes
must
rank
upon
the
mantelpiece
his
clothing
must
be
kept
in
the
trunk
cups
plates
knives
forks
and
spoons
would
lie
in
the
little
open
cupboard
the
lowest
section
of
which
was
for
his
supply
of
coals
when
everything
was
in
order
he
drew
water
from
a
tap
on
the
landing
and
washed
himself
then
with
his
bag
went
out
to
make
purchases
a
loaf
of
bread
butter
sugar
condensed
milk
a
remnant
of
tea
he
had
brought
with
him
on
returning
he
lit
as
small
a
fire
as
possible
put
on
his
kettle
and
sat
down
to
meditate
how
familiar
it
all
was
to
him
and
not
unpleasant
for
it
brought
back
the
days
when
he
had
worked
to
such
good
purpose
it
was
like
a
restoration
of
youth
of
amy
he
would
not
think
knowing
his
bitter
misery
she
could
write
to
him
in
cold
hard
words
without
a
touch
even
of
womanly
feeling
if
ever
they
were
to
meet
again
the
advance
must
be
from
her
side
he
had
no
more
tenderness
for
her
until
she
strove
to
revive
it
next
morning
he
called
at
the
hospital
to
see
carter
the
secretary
s
peculiar
look
and
smile
seemed
to
betray
a
knowledge
of
what
had
been
going
on
since
sunday
and
his
first
words
confirmed
this
impression
of
reardon
s
you
have
removed
i
hear
yes
i
had
better
give
you
my
new
reardon
s
tone
was
meant
to
signify
that
further
remark
on
the
subject
would
be
unwelcome
musingly
carter
made
a
note
of
the
address
you
still
wish
to
go
on
with
this
affair
come
and
have
some
lunch
with
me
then
and
afterwards
we
ll
go
to
the
city
road
and
talk
things
over
on
the
the
vivacious
young
man
was
not
quite
so
genial
as
of
wont
but
he
evidently
strove
to
show
that
the
renewal
of
their
relations
as
employer
and
clerk
would
make
no
difference
in
the
friendly
intercourse
which
had
since
been
established
the
invitation
to
lunch
evidently
had
this
purpose
i
suppose
said
carter
when
they
were
seated
in
a
restaurant
you
wouldn
t
object
to
anything
better
if
a
chance
turned
up
i
should
take
it
to
be
but
you
don
t
want
a
job
that
would
occupy
all
your
time
you
re
going
on
with
writing
of
course
not
for
the
present
i
then
you
would
like
me
to
keep
a
i
haven
t
anything
in
view
nothing
whatever
but
one
hears
of
things
i
should
be
obliged
to
you
if
you
could
help
me
to
anything
having
brought
himself
to
this
admission
reardon
felt
more
at
ease
to
what
purpose
should
he
keep
up
transparent
pretences
it
was
manifestly
his
duty
to
earn
as
much
money
as
he
could
in
whatever
way
let
the
man
of
letters
be
forgotten
he
was
seeking
for
remunerative
employment
just
as
if
he
had
never
written
a
line
amy
did
not
return
the
ten
pounds
and
did
not
write
again
so
presumably
she
would
accept
the
moiety
of
his
earnings
he
was
glad
of
it
after
paying
for
rent
there
would
be
left
ten
shillings
something
like
three
pounds
that
still
remained
to
him
he
would
not
reckon
this
must
be
for
casualties
was
enough
for
his
needs
in
the
old
times
he
had
counted
it
a
competency
which
put
his
mind
quite
at
rest
the
day
came
and
he
entered
upon
his
duties
in
city
road
it
needed
but
an
hour
or
two
and
all
the
intervening
time
was
cancelled
he
was
back
once
more
in
the
days
of
no
reputation
a
harmless
clerk
a
decent
chapter
xx
the
end
of
waiting
it
was
more
than
a
fortnight
after
reardon
s
removal
to
islington
when
jasper
milvain
heard
for
the
first
time
of
what
had
happened
he
was
coming
down
from
the
office
of
the
one
afternoon
after
a
talk
with
the
editor
concerning
a
paragraph
in
his
last
week
s
causerie
which
had
been
complained
of
as
libellous
and
which
would
probably
lead
to
the
case
so
much
desired
by
everyone
connected
with
the
paper
when
someone
descending
from
a
higher
storey
of
the
building
overtook
him
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
turned
and
saw
whelpdale
what
brings
you
on
these
premises
he
asked
as
they
shook
hands
a
man
i
know
has
just
been
made
of
chat
upstairs
he
has
half
promised
to
let
me
do
a
column
of
answers
to
cosmetics
fashions
cookery
i
m
not
so
versatile
as
all
that
unfortunately
no
the
general
information
column
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
inform
me
through
the
medium
of
your
invaluable
paper
what
was
the
exact
area
devastated
by
the
great
fire
of
london
that
kind
of
thing
you
know
hopburn
that
s
the
fellow
s
name
tells
me
that
his
predecessor
always
called
the
paper
because
of
the
frightful
difficulty
he
had
in
filling
it
up
each
week
what
a
capital
column
that
is
of
yours
in
i
know
nothing
like
it
in
english
journalism
upon
my
word
i
don
t
glad
you
like
it
some
people
are
less
fervent
in
their
jasper
recounted
the
affair
which
had
just
been
under
discussion
in
the
office
it
may
cost
a
couple
of
thousands
but
the
advertisement
is
worth
that
patwin
thinks
barlow
is
delighted
he
wouldn
t
mind
paying
double
the
money
to
make
those
people
a
for
a
week
or
they
issued
into
the
street
and
walked
on
together
milvain
with
his
keen
eye
and
critical
smile
unmistakably
the
modern
young
man
who
cultivates
the
art
of
success
his
companion
of
a
less
pronounced
type
but
distinguished
by
a
certain
subtlety
of
countenance
a
blending
of
the
sentimental
and
the
shrewd
of
course
you
know
all
about
the
reardons
said
whelpdale
haven
t
seen
or
heard
of
them
lately
what
is
it
then
you
don
t
know
that
they
have
parted
parted
i
only
heard
about
it
last
night
biffen
told
me
reardon
is
doing
clerk
s
work
at
a
hospital
somewhere
in
the
and
his
wife
has
gone
to
live
at
her
mother
s
ho
ho
exclaimed
jasper
thoughtfully
then
the
crash
has
come
of
course
i
knew
it
must
be
impending
i
m
sorry
for
i
m
sorry
for
his
trust
you
for
thinking
of
women
first
it
s
in
an
honourable
way
my
dear
fellow
i
m
a
slave
to
women
true
but
all
in
an
honourable
way
after
that
last
adventure
of
mine
most
men
would
be
savage
and
cynical
wouldn
t
they
now
i
m
nothing
of
the
kind
i
think
no
worse
of
women
not
a
bit
i
reverence
them
as
much
as
ever
there
must
be
a
good
deal
of
magnanimity
in
me
don
t
you
think
jasper
laughed
unrestrainedly
but
it
s
the
simple
truth
pursued
the
other
you
should
have
seen
the
letter
i
wrote
to
that
girl
at
birmingham
all
charity
and
forgiveness
i
meant
it
every
word
of
it
i
shouldn
t
talk
to
everyone
like
this
you
know
but
it
s
as
well
to
show
a
friend
one
s
best
qualities
now
and
is
reardon
still
living
at
the
old
place
no
no
they
sold
up
everything
and
let
the
flat
he
s
in
lodgings
somewhere
or
other
i
m
not
quite
intimate
enough
with
him
to
go
and
see
him
under
the
circumstances
but
i
m
surprised
you
know
nothing
about
i
haven
t
seen
much
of
them
this
year
reardon
well
i
m
afraid
he
hasn
t
very
much
of
the
virtue
you
claim
for
yourself
it
rather
annoys
him
to
see
me
going
really
his
character
never
struck
me
in
that
you
haven
t
come
enough
in
contact
with
him
at
all
events
i
can
t
explain
his
change
of
manner
in
any
other
way
but
i
m
sorry
for
him
i
am
indeed
at
a
hospital
i
suppose
carter
has
given
him
the
old
job
again
don
t
know
biffen
doesn
t
talk
very
freely
about
it
there
s
a
good
deal
of
delicacy
in
biffen
you
know
a
thoroughly
fellow
and
so
is
reardon
i
believe
though
no
doubt
he
has
his
oh
an
excellent
fellow
but
weakness
isn
t
the
word
why
i
foresaw
all
this
from
the
very
beginning
the
first
hour
s
talk
i
ever
had
with
him
was
enough
to
convince
me
that
he
d
never
hold
his
own
but
he
really
believed
that
the
future
was
clear
before
him
he
imagined
he
d
go
on
getting
more
and
more
for
his
books
an
extraordinary
thing
that
that
girl
had
such
faith
in
him
they
parted
soon
after
this
and
milvain
went
homeward
musing
upon
what
he
had
heard
it
was
his
purpose
to
spend
the
whole
evening
on
some
work
which
pressed
for
completion
but
he
found
an
unusual
difficulty
in
settling
to
it
about
eight
o
clock
he
gave
up
the
effort
arrayed
himself
in
the
costume
of
black
and
white
and
journeyed
to
westbourne
park
where
his
destination
was
the
house
of
mrs
edmund
yule
of
the
servant
who
opened
to
him
he
inquired
if
mrs
yule
was
at
home
and
received
an
answer
in
the
affirmative
any
company
with
her
a
lady
mrs
then
please
to
give
my
name
and
ask
if
mrs
yule
can
see
he
was
speedily
conducted
to
the
where
he
found
the
lady
of
the
house
her
son
and
mrs
carter
for
mrs
reardon
his
eye
sought
in
vain
i
m
so
glad
you
have
come
said
mrs
yule
in
a
confidential
tone
i
have
been
wishing
to
see
you
of
course
you
know
of
our
sad
trouble
i
have
heard
of
it
only
from
mr
reardon
himself
no
i
haven
t
seen
i
do
wish
you
had
we
should
have
been
so
anxious
to
know
how
he
impressed
how
he
impressed
me
my
mother
has
got
hold
of
the
notion
put
in
john
yule
that
he
s
not
exactly
compos
mentis
i
ll
admit
that
he
went
on
in
a
queer
sort
of
way
the
last
time
i
saw
and
my
husband
thinks
he
is
rather
strange
remarked
mrs
carter
he
has
gone
back
to
the
hospital
i
understand
to
a
new
branch
that
has
just
been
opened
in
the
city
road
replied
mrs
yule
and
he
s
living
in
a
dreadful
place
one
of
the
most
shocking
alleys
in
the
worst
part
of
islington
i
should
have
gone
to
see
him
but
i
really
feel
afraid
they
give
me
such
an
account
of
the
place
and
everyone
agrees
that
he
has
such
a
very
wild
look
and
speaks
so
between
ourselves
said
john
there
s
no
use
in
exaggerating
he
s
living
in
a
vile
hole
that
s
true
and
carter
says
he
looks
miserably
ill
but
of
course
he
may
be
as
sane
as
we
are
jasper
listened
to
all
this
with
no
small
astonishment
and
mrs
reardon
he
asked
i
m
sorry
to
say
she
is
far
from
well
replied
mrs
yule
she
has
been
obliged
to
keep
her
room
you
can
imagine
what
a
shock
it
has
been
to
her
it
came
with
such
extraordinary
suddenness
without
a
word
of
warning
her
husband
announced
that
he
had
taken
a
clerkship
and
was
going
to
remove
immediately
to
the
fancy
and
this
when
he
had
already
arranged
as
you
know
to
go
to
the
south
coast
and
write
his
next
book
under
the
influences
of
the
sea
air
he
was
anything
but
well
we
all
knew
that
and
we
had
all
joined
in
advising
him
to
spend
the
summer
at
the
seaside
it
seemed
better
that
he
should
go
alone
mrs
reardon
would
of
course
have
gone
down
for
a
few
days
now
and
then
and
at
a
moment
s
notice
everything
is
changed
and
in
such
a
dreadful
way
i
can
not
believe
that
this
is
the
behaviour
of
a
sane
man
jasper
understood
that
an
explanation
of
the
matter
might
have
been
given
in
much
more
homely
terms
it
was
natural
that
mrs
yule
should
leave
out
of
sight
the
sufficient
but
ignoble
cause
of
her
s
behaviour
you
see
in
what
a
painful
position
we
are
placed
continued
the
euphemistic
lady
it
is
so
terrible
even
to
hint
that
mr
reardon
is
not
responsible
for
his
actions
yet
how
are
we
to
explain
to
our
friends
this
extraordinary
state
of
things
my
husband
is
afraid
mr
reardon
may
fall
seriously
ill
said
mrs
carter
and
how
dreadful
in
such
a
place
as
that
it
would
be
so
kind
of
you
to
go
and
see
him
mr
milvain
urged
mrs
yule
we
should
be
so
glad
to
hear
what
you
certainly
i
will
go
replied
jasper
will
you
give
me
his
address
he
remained
for
an
hour
and
before
his
departure
the
subject
was
discussed
with
rather
more
frankness
than
at
first
even
the
word
money
was
once
or
twice
heard
mr
carter
has
very
kindly
promised
said
mrs
yule
to
do
his
best
to
hear
of
some
position
that
would
be
suitable
it
seems
a
most
shocking
thing
that
a
successful
author
should
abandon
his
career
in
this
deliberate
way
who
could
have
imagined
anything
of
the
kind
two
years
ago
but
it
is
clearly
quite
impossible
for
him
to
go
on
as
at
present
if
there
is
really
no
reason
for
believing
his
mind
a
cab
was
summoned
for
mrs
carter
and
she
took
her
leave
suppressing
her
native
cheerfulness
to
the
tone
of
the
occasion
a
minute
or
two
after
milvain
left
the
house
he
had
walked
perhaps
twenty
yards
almost
to
the
end
of
the
silent
street
in
which
his
friends
house
was
situated
when
a
man
came
round
the
corner
and
approached
him
at
once
he
recognised
the
figure
and
in
a
moment
he
was
face
to
face
with
reardon
both
stopped
jasper
held
out
his
hand
but
the
other
did
not
seem
to
notice
it
you
are
coming
from
mrs
yule
s
said
reardon
with
a
strange
smile
by
the
gaslight
his
face
showed
pale
and
sunken
and
he
met
jasper
s
look
with
fixedness
yes
i
am
the
fact
is
i
went
there
to
hear
of
your
address
why
haven
t
you
let
me
know
about
all
this
you
went
to
the
flat
no
i
was
told
about
you
by
reardon
turned
in
the
direction
whence
he
had
come
and
began
to
walk
slowly
jasper
kept
beside
him
i
m
afraid
there
s
something
amiss
between
us
reardon
said
the
latter
just
glancing
at
his
companion
there
s
something
amiss
between
me
and
everyone
was
the
reply
in
an
unnatural
voice
you
look
at
things
too
gloomily
am
i
detaining
you
you
were
going
then
come
to
my
rooms
and
let
us
see
if
we
can
t
talk
more
in
the
old
your
old
way
of
talk
isn
t
much
to
my
taste
milvain
it
has
cost
me
too
jasper
gazed
at
him
was
there
some
foundation
for
mrs
yule
s
seeming
extravagance
this
reply
sounded
so
meaningless
and
so
unlike
reardon
s
manner
of
speech
that
the
younger
man
experienced
a
sudden
alarm
cost
you
too
much
i
don
t
understand
they
had
turned
into
a
broader
thoroughfare
which
however
was
little
frequented
at
this
hour
reardon
his
hands
thrust
into
the
pockets
of
a
shabby
overcoat
and
his
head
bent
forward
went
on
at
a
slow
pace
observant
of
nothing
for
a
moment
or
two
he
delayed
reply
then
said
in
an
unsteady
voice
your
way
of
talking
has
always
been
to
glorify
success
to
insist
upon
it
as
the
one
end
a
man
ought
to
keep
in
view
if
you
had
talked
so
to
me
alone
it
wouldn
t
have
mattered
but
there
was
generally
someone
else
present
your
words
had
their
effect
i
can
see
that
now
it
s
very
much
owing
to
you
that
i
am
deserted
now
that
there
s
no
hope
of
my
ever
jasper
s
first
impulse
was
to
meet
this
accusation
with
indignant
denial
but
a
sense
of
compassion
prevailed
it
was
so
painful
to
see
the
defeated
man
wandering
at
night
near
the
house
where
his
wife
and
child
were
comfortably
sheltered
and
the
tone
in
which
he
spoke
revealed
such
profound
misery
that
s
a
most
astonishing
thing
to
say
jasper
replied
of
course
i
know
nothing
of
what
has
passed
between
you
and
your
wife
but
i
feel
certain
that
i
have
no
more
to
do
with
what
has
happened
than
any
other
of
your
you
may
feel
as
certain
as
you
will
but
your
words
and
your
example
have
influenced
my
wife
against
me
you
didn
t
intend
that
i
don
t
suppose
it
for
a
moment
it
s
my
misfortune
that
s
that
i
intended
nothing
of
the
kind
you
need
hardly
say
i
should
think
but
you
are
deceiving
yourself
in
the
strangest
way
i
m
afraid
to
speak
plainly
i
m
afraid
of
offending
you
but
can
you
recall
something
that
i
said
about
the
time
of
your
marriage
you
didn
t
like
it
then
and
certainly
it
won
t
be
pleasant
to
you
to
remember
it
now
if
you
mean
that
your
wife
has
grown
unkind
to
you
because
you
are
unfortunate
there
s
no
need
to
examine
into
other
people
s
influence
for
an
explanation
of
reardon
turned
his
face
towards
the
speaker
then
you
have
always
regarded
my
wife
as
a
woman
likely
to
fail
me
in
time
of
need
i
don
t
care
to
answer
a
question
put
in
that
way
if
we
are
no
longer
to
talk
with
the
old
friendliness
it
s
far
better
we
shouldn
t
discuss
things
such
as
well
practically
you
have
answered
of
course
i
remember
those
words
of
yours
that
you
refer
to
whether
you
were
right
or
wrong
doesn
t
affect
what
i
he
spoke
with
a
dull
doggedness
as
though
mental
fatigue
did
not
allow
him
to
say
more
it
s
impossible
to
argue
against
such
a
charge
said
milvain
i
am
convinced
it
isn
t
true
and
that
s
all
i
can
answer
but
perhaps
you
think
this
extraordinary
influence
of
mine
is
still
being
used
against
you
i
know
nothing
about
it
reardon
replied
in
the
same
unmodulated
voice
well
as
i
have
told
you
this
was
my
first
visit
to
mrs
yule
s
since
your
wife
has
been
there
and
i
didn
t
see
her
she
isn
t
very
well
and
keeps
her
room
i
m
glad
it
happened
so
that
i
didn
t
meet
her
henceforth
i
shall
keep
away
from
the
family
altogether
so
long
at
all
events
as
your
wife
remains
with
them
of
course
i
shan
t
tell
anyone
why
that
would
be
impossible
but
you
shan
t
have
to
fear
that
i
am
decrying
you
by
jove
an
amiable
figure
you
make
of
me
i
have
said
what
i
didn
t
wish
to
say
and
what
i
oughtn
t
to
have
said
you
must
misunderstand
me
i
can
t
help
reardon
had
been
walking
for
hours
and
was
in
truth
exhausted
he
became
mute
jasper
whose
misrepresentation
was
wilful
though
not
maliciously
so
also
fell
into
silence
he
did
not
believe
that
his
conversations
with
amy
had
seriously
affected
the
course
of
events
but
he
knew
that
he
had
often
said
things
to
her
in
private
which
would
scarcely
have
fallen
from
his
lips
if
her
husband
had
been
present
little
depreciatory
phrases
wrong
rather
in
tone
than
in
terms
which
came
of
his
irresistible
desire
to
assume
superiority
whenever
it
was
possible
he
too
was
weak
but
with
quite
another
kind
of
weakness
than
reardon
s
his
was
the
weakness
of
vanity
which
sometimes
leads
a
man
to
commit
treacheries
of
which
he
would
believe
himself
incapable
he
took
refuge
in
the
pretence
of
misconception
which
again
was
a
betrayal
of
littleness
they
drew
near
to
westbourne
park
station
you
are
living
a
long
way
from
here
jasper
said
coldly
are
you
going
by
train
no
you
said
my
wife
was
ill
oh
not
at
least
i
didn
t
understand
that
it
was
anything
serious
why
don
t
you
walk
back
to
the
house
i
must
judge
of
my
own
true
i
beg
your
pardon
i
take
the
train
here
so
i
ll
say
they
nodded
to
each
other
but
did
not
shake
hands
a
day
or
two
later
milvain
wrote
to
mrs
yule
and
told
her
that
he
had
seen
reardon
he
did
not
describe
the
circumstances
under
which
the
interview
had
taken
place
but
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
reardon
was
in
a
state
of
nervous
illness
and
made
by
suffering
quite
unlike
himself
that
he
might
be
on
the
way
to
positive
mental
disease
seemed
likely
enough
unhappily
i
myself
can
be
of
no
use
to
him
he
has
not
the
same
friendly
feeling
for
me
as
he
used
to
have
but
it
is
very
certain
that
those
of
his
friends
who
have
the
power
should
exert
themselves
to
raise
him
out
of
this
fearful
slough
of
despond
if
he
isn
t
effectually
helped
there
s
no
saying
what
may
happen
one
thing
is
certain
i
think
he
is
past
helping
himself
sane
literary
work
can
not
be
expected
from
him
it
seems
a
monstrous
thing
that
so
good
a
fellow
and
one
with
such
excellent
brains
too
should
perish
by
the
way
when
influential
people
would
have
no
difficulty
in
restoring
him
to
health
and
all
the
months
of
summer
went
by
jasper
kept
his
word
and
never
visited
mrs
yule
s
house
but
once
in
july
he
met
that
lady
at
the
carters
and
heard
then
what
he
knew
from
other
sources
that
the
position
of
things
was
unchanged
in
august
mrs
yule
spent
a
fortnight
at
the
seaside
and
amy
accompanied
her
milvain
and
his
sisters
accepted
an
invitation
to
visit
friends
at
wattleborough
and
were
out
of
town
about
three
weeks
the
last
ten
days
being
passed
in
the
isle
of
wight
it
was
an
extravagant
holiday
but
dora
had
been
ailing
and
her
brother
declared
that
they
would
all
work
better
for
the
change
alfred
yule
with
his
wife
and
daughter
rusticated
somewhere
in
kent
dora
and
marian
exchanged
letters
and
here
is
a
passage
from
one
written
by
the
former
jasper
has
shown
himself
in
an
unusually
amiable
light
since
we
left
town
i
looked
forward
to
this
holiday
with
some
misgivings
as
i
know
by
experience
that
it
doesn
t
do
for
him
and
us
to
be
too
much
together
he
gets
tired
of
our
company
and
then
his
selfishness
believe
me
he
has
a
good
deal
of
it
comes
out
in
a
way
we
don
t
appreciate
but
i
have
never
known
him
so
forbearing
to
me
he
is
particularly
kind
on
account
of
my
headaches
and
general
shakiness
it
isn
t
impossible
that
this
young
man
if
all
goes
well
with
him
may
turn
out
far
better
than
maud
and
i
ever
expected
but
things
will
have
to
go
very
well
if
the
improvement
is
to
be
permanent
i
only
hope
he
may
make
a
lot
of
money
before
long
if
this
sounds
rather
gross
to
you
i
can
only
say
that
jasper
s
moral
nature
will
never
be
safe
as
long
as
he
is
exposed
to
the
risks
of
poverty
there
are
such
people
you
know
as
a
poor
man
i
wouldn
t
trust
him
out
of
my
sight
with
money
he
will
be
a
tolerable
creature
as
men
dora
no
doubt
had
her
reasons
for
writing
in
this
strain
she
would
not
have
made
such
remarks
in
conversation
with
her
friend
but
took
the
opportunity
of
being
at
a
distance
to
communicate
them
in
writing
on
their
return
the
two
girls
made
good
progress
with
the
book
they
were
manufacturing
for
messrs
jolly
and
monk
and
early
in
october
it
was
finished
dora
was
now
writing
little
things
for
the
english
girl
and
maud
had
begun
to
review
an
occasional
novel
for
an
illustrated
paper
in
spite
of
their
poor
lodgings
they
had
been
brought
into
social
relations
with
mrs
boston
wright
and
a
few
of
her
friends
their
position
was
understood
and
in
accepting
invitations
they
had
no
fear
lest
unwelcome
people
should
pounce
down
upon
them
in
their
shabby
little
the
younger
sister
cared
little
for
society
such
as
jasper
procured
them
with
marian
yule
for
a
companion
she
would
have
been
quite
content
to
spend
her
evenings
at
home
but
maud
relished
the
introduction
to
strangers
she
was
admired
and
knew
it
prudence
could
not
restrain
her
from
buying
a
handsomer
dress
than
those
she
had
brought
from
her
country
home
and
it
irked
her
sorely
that
she
might
not
reconstruct
all
her
equipment
to
rival
the
appearance
of
girls
whom
she
studied
and
envied
her
disadvantages
for
the
present
were
insuperable
she
had
no
one
to
chaperon
her
she
could
not
form
intimacies
because
of
her
poverty
a
rare
invitation
to
luncheon
a
permission
to
call
at
the
sacred
hour
of
this
was
all
she
could
hope
for
i
advise
you
to
possess
your
soul
in
patience
jasper
said
to
her
as
they
talked
one
day
on
the
you
are
not
to
blame
that
you
live
without
conventional
protection
but
it
necessitates
your
being
very
careful
these
people
you
are
getting
to
know
are
not
rigid
about
social
observances
and
they
won
t
exactly
despise
you
for
poverty
all
the
same
their
charity
mustn
t
be
tested
too
severely
be
very
quiet
for
the
present
let
it
be
seen
that
you
understand
that
your
position
isn
t
quite
regular
i
mean
of
course
do
so
in
a
modest
and
nice
way
as
soon
as
ever
it
s
possible
we
ll
arrange
for
you
to
live
with
someone
who
will
preserve
appearances
all
this
is
contemptible
of
course
but
we
belong
to
a
contemptible
society
and
can
t
help
ourselves
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
spoil
your
chances
by
rashness
be
content
to
wait
a
little
till
some
more
money
comes
midway
in
october
about
eight
one
evening
jasper
received
an
unexpected
visit
from
dora
he
was
in
his
smoking
and
reading
a
novel
anything
wrong
he
asked
as
his
sister
entered
no
but
i
m
alone
this
evening
and
i
thought
i
would
see
if
you
were
in
where
s
maud
then
she
went
to
see
the
lanes
this
afternoon
and
mrs
lane
invited
her
to
go
to
the
gaiety
she
said
a
friend
whom
she
had
invited
couldn
t
come
and
the
ticket
would
be
wasted
maud
went
back
to
dine
with
them
she
ll
come
home
in
a
why
is
mrs
lane
so
affectionate
all
at
once
take
your
things
off
i
have
nothing
to
miss
radway
was
going
as
who
s
miss
radway
don
t
you
know
her
she
s
staying
with
the
lanes
maud
says
she
writes
for
the
west
and
will
that
fellow
lane
be
with
them
i
think
jasper
mused
contemplating
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
i
suppose
she
was
in
rare
excitement
pretty
well
she
has
wanted
to
go
to
the
gaiety
for
a
long
time
there
s
no
harm
is
there
dora
asked
the
question
with
that
absent
air
which
girls
are
wont
to
assume
when
they
touch
on
doubtful
subjects
harm
no
idiocy
and
lively
music
that
s
all
it
s
too
late
or
i
d
have
taken
you
for
the
joke
of
the
thing
confound
it
she
ought
to
have
better
oh
she
looked
very
nice
in
that
pooh
but
i
don
t
care
for
her
to
be
running
about
with
the
lanes
lane
is
too
big
a
blackguard
it
reflects
upon
his
wife
to
a
certain
they
gossiped
for
half
an
hour
then
a
tap
at
the
door
interrupted
them
it
was
the
landlady
mr
whelpdale
has
called
to
see
you
sir
i
mentioned
as
miss
milvain
was
here
so
he
said
he
wouldn
t
come
up
unless
you
sent
to
ask
jasper
smiled
at
dora
and
said
in
a
low
voice
what
do
you
say
shall
he
come
up
he
can
behave
just
as
you
please
ask
him
to
come
up
mrs
thompson
mr
whelpdale
presented
himself
he
entered
with
much
more
ceremony
than
when
milvain
was
alone
on
his
visage
was
a
grave
respectfulness
his
step
was
light
his
whole
bearing
expressed
diffidence
and
pleasurable
anticipation
my
younger
sister
whelpdale
said
jasper
with
subdued
amusement
the
dealer
in
literary
advice
made
a
bow
which
did
him
no
discredit
and
began
to
speak
in
a
low
reverential
tone
not
at
all
disagreeable
to
the
ear
his
breeding
in
truth
had
been
that
of
a
gentleman
and
it
was
only
of
late
years
that
he
had
fallen
into
the
hungry
region
of
new
grub
street
how
s
the
manual
going
off
milvain
inquired
excellently
we
have
sold
nearly
six
my
sister
is
one
of
your
readers
i
believe
she
has
studied
the
book
with
much
really
you
have
really
read
it
miss
milvain
dora
assured
him
that
she
had
and
his
delight
knew
no
bounds
it
isn
t
all
rubbish
by
any
means
said
jasper
graciously
in
the
chapter
on
writing
for
magazines
there
are
one
or
two
very
good
hints
what
a
pity
you
can
t
apply
your
own
advice
whelpdale
now
that
s
horribly
unkind
of
you
protested
the
other
you
might
have
spared
me
this
evening
but
unfortunately
it
s
quite
true
miss
milvain
i
point
the
way
but
i
haven
t
been
able
to
travel
it
myself
you
mustn
t
think
i
have
never
succeeded
in
getting
things
published
but
i
can
t
keep
it
up
as
a
profession
your
brother
is
the
successful
man
a
marvellous
facility
i
envy
him
few
men
at
present
writing
have
such
please
don
t
make
him
more
conceited
than
he
naturally
is
interposed
dora
what
news
of
biffen
asked
jasper
presently
he
says
he
shall
finish
mr
bailey
grocer
in
about
a
month
he
read
me
one
of
the
later
chapters
the
other
night
it
s
really
very
fine
most
remarkable
writing
it
seems
to
me
it
will
be
scandalous
if
he
can
t
get
it
published
it
will
i
do
hope
he
may
said
dora
laughing
i
have
heard
so
much
of
mr
bailey
that
it
will
be
a
great
disappointment
if
i
am
never
to
read
i
m
afraid
it
would
give
you
very
little
pleasure
whelpdale
replied
hesitatingly
the
matter
is
so
very
and
the
hero
grocer
shouted
jasper
mirthfully
oh
but
it
s
quite
decent
only
rather
depressing
the
decently
ignoble
or
the
ignobly
decent
which
is
biffen
s
formula
i
saw
him
a
week
ago
and
he
looked
hungrier
than
ah
but
poor
reardon
i
passed
him
at
king
s
cross
not
long
ago
he
didn
t
see
me
walks
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
always
and
i
hadn
t
the
courage
to
stop
him
he
s
the
ghost
of
his
old
self
he
can
t
live
dora
and
her
brother
exchanged
a
glance
it
was
a
long
time
since
jasper
had
spoken
to
his
sisters
about
the
reardons
nowadays
he
seldom
heard
either
of
husband
or
wife
the
conversation
that
went
on
was
so
agreeable
to
whelpdale
that
he
lost
consciousness
of
time
it
was
past
eleven
o
clock
when
jasper
felt
obliged
to
remind
him
dora
i
think
i
must
be
taking
you
the
visitor
at
once
made
ready
for
departure
and
his
was
as
respectful
as
his
entrance
had
been
though
he
might
not
say
what
he
thought
there
was
very
legible
upon
his
countenance
a
hope
that
he
would
again
be
privileged
to
meet
miss
dora
milvain
not
a
bad
fellow
in
his
way
said
jasper
when
dora
and
he
were
alone
again
not
at
she
had
heard
the
story
of
whelpdale
s
hapless
wooing
half
a
year
ago
and
her
recollection
of
it
explained
the
smile
with
which
she
spoke
never
get
on
i
m
afraid
jasper
pursued
he
has
his
allowance
of
twenty
pounds
a
year
and
makes
perhaps
fifty
or
sixty
more
if
i
were
in
his
position
i
should
go
in
for
some
kind
of
regular
business
he
has
people
who
could
help
him
fellow
but
what
s
the
use
of
that
if
you
ve
no
money
they
set
out
together
and
walked
to
the
girls
lodgings
dora
was
about
to
use
her
but
jasper
checked
her
no
there
s
a
light
in
the
kitchen
still
better
knock
as
we
re
so
but
why
never
mind
do
as
i
tell
the
landlady
admitted
them
and
jasper
spoke
a
word
or
two
with
her
explaining
that
he
would
wait
until
his
elder
sister
s
return
the
darkness
of
the
windows
had
shown
that
maud
was
not
yet
back
what
strange
fancies
you
have
remarked
dora
when
they
were
upstairs
so
have
people
in
general
a
letter
lay
on
the
table
it
was
addressed
to
maud
and
dora
recognised
the
handwriting
as
that
of
a
wattleborough
friend
there
must
be
some
news
here
she
said
mrs
haynes
wouldn
t
write
unless
she
had
something
special
to
say
just
upon
midnight
a
cab
drew
up
before
the
house
dora
ran
down
to
open
the
door
to
her
sister
who
came
in
with
very
bright
eyes
and
more
colour
than
usual
on
her
cheeks
how
late
for
you
to
be
here
she
exclaimed
on
entering
the
and
seeing
jasper
i
shouldn
t
have
felt
comfortable
till
i
knew
that
you
were
back
all
what
fear
was
there
she
threw
off
her
wraps
laughing
well
have
you
enjoyed
yourself
oh
yes
she
replied
carelessly
this
letter
for
me
what
has
mrs
haynes
got
to
say
i
wonder
she
opened
the
envelope
and
began
to
glance
hurriedly
over
the
sheet
of
paper
then
her
face
changed
what
do
you
think
mr
yule
is
dead
dora
uttered
an
exclamation
jasper
displayed
the
keenest
interest
he
died
yesterday
no
it
would
be
the
day
before
yesterday
he
had
a
fit
of
some
kind
at
a
public
meeting
was
taken
to
the
hospital
because
it
was
nearest
and
died
in
a
few
hours
so
that
has
come
at
last
now
what
ll
be
the
result
of
it
i
wonder
when
shall
you
be
seeing
marian
asked
her
brother
she
might
come
but
won
t
she
go
to
the
funeral
suggested
dora
perhaps
there
s
no
saying
i
suppose
her
father
will
at
all
events
the
day
before
yesterday
then
the
funeral
will
be
on
saturday
i
should
ought
i
to
write
to
marian
asked
dora
no
i
wouldn
t
was
jasper
s
reply
better
wait
till
she
lets
you
hear
that
s
sure
to
be
soon
she
may
have
gone
to
wattleborough
this
afternoon
or
be
going
the
letter
from
mrs
haynes
was
passed
from
hand
to
hand
everybody
feels
sure
it
said
that
a
great
deal
of
his
money
will
be
left
for
public
purposes
the
ground
for
the
park
being
already
purchased
he
is
sure
to
have
made
provision
for
carrying
out
his
plans
connected
with
it
but
i
hope
your
friends
in
london
may
it
was
some
time
before
jasper
could
put
an
end
to
the
speculative
conversation
and
betake
himself
homewards
and
even
on
getting
back
to
his
lodgings
he
was
little
disposed
to
go
to
bed
this
event
of
john
yule
s
death
had
been
constantly
in
his
mind
but
there
was
always
a
fear
that
it
might
not
happen
for
long
enough
the
sudden
announcement
excited
him
almost
as
much
as
if
he
were
a
relative
of
the
deceased
confound
his
public
purposes
was
the
thought
upon
which
he
at
length
slept
chapter
xxi
mr
yule
leaves
town
since
the
domestic
incidents
connected
with
that
unpleasant
review
in
the
current
the
relations
between
alfred
yule
and
his
daughter
had
suffered
a
permanent
change
though
not
in
a
degree
noticeable
by
any
one
but
the
two
concerned
to
all
appearances
they
worked
together
and
conversed
very
much
as
they
had
been
wont
to
do
but
marian
was
made
to
feel
in
many
subtle
ways
that
her
father
no
longer
had
complete
confidence
in
her
no
longer
took
the
same
pleasure
as
formerly
in
the
skill
and
conscientiousness
of
her
work
and
yule
on
his
side
perceived
too
clearly
that
the
girl
was
preoccupied
with
something
other
than
her
old
wish
to
aid
and
satisfy
him
that
she
had
a
new
life
of
her
own
alien
to
and
in
some
respects
irreconcilable
with
the
existence
in
which
he
desired
to
confirm
her
there
was
no
renewal
of
open
disagreement
but
their
conversations
frequently
ended
by
tacit
mutual
consent
at
a
point
which
threatened
divergence
and
in
yule
s
case
every
such
warning
was
a
cause
of
intense
irritation
he
feared
to
provoke
marian
and
this
fear
was
again
a
torture
to
his
pride
beyond
the
fact
that
his
daughter
was
in
constant
communication
with
the
miss
milvains
he
knew
and
could
discover
nothing
of
the
terms
on
which
she
stood
with
the
girls
brother
and
this
ignorance
was
harder
to
bear
than
full
assurance
of
a
disagreeable
fact
would
have
been
that
a
man
like
jasper
milvain
whose
name
was
every
now
and
then
forced
upon
his
notice
as
a
rising
periodicalist
and
a
faithful
henchman
of
the
unspeakable
fadge
that
a
young
fellow
of
such
excellent
prospects
should
seriously
attach
himself
to
a
girl
like
marian
seemed
to
him
highly
improbable
save
indeed
for
the
one
consideration
that
milvain
who
assuredly
had
a
very
keen
eye
to
chances
might
regard
the
girl
as
a
niece
of
old
john
yule
and
therefore
worth
holding
in
view
until
it
was
decided
whether
or
not
she
would
benefit
by
her
uncle
s
decease
fixed
in
his
antipathy
to
the
young
man
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
admit
any
but
a
base
motive
on
milvain
s
side
if
indeed
marian
and
jasper
were
more
to
each
other
than
slight
acquaintances
and
he
persuaded
himself
that
anxiety
for
the
girl
s
welfare
was
at
least
as
strong
a
motive
with
him
as
mere
prejudice
against
the
ally
of
fadge
and
it
might
be
the
reviewer
of
english
milvain
was
quite
capable
of
playing
fast
and
loose
with
a
girl
and
marian
owing
to
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
her
position
would
easily
be
misled
by
the
pretence
of
a
clever
speculator
that
she
had
never
spoken
again
about
the
review
in
the
current
might
receive
several
explanations
perhaps
she
had
not
been
able
to
convince
herself
either
for
or
against
milvain
s
authorship
perhaps
she
had
reason
to
suspect
that
the
young
man
was
the
author
perhaps
she
merely
shrank
from
reviving
a
discussion
in
which
she
might
betray
what
she
desired
to
keep
secret
this
last
was
the
truth
finding
that
her
father
did
not
recur
to
the
subject
marian
concluded
that
he
had
found
himself
to
be
misinformed
but
yule
though
he
heard
the
original
rumour
denied
by
people
whom
in
other
matters
he
would
have
trusted
would
not
lay
aside
the
doubt
that
flattered
his
prejudices
if
milvain
were
not
the
writer
of
the
review
he
very
well
might
have
been
and
what
certainty
could
be
arrived
at
in
matters
of
literary
gossip
there
was
an
element
of
jealousy
in
the
father
s
feeling
if
he
did
not
love
marian
with
all
the
warmth
of
which
a
parent
is
capable
at
least
he
had
more
affection
for
her
than
for
any
other
person
and
of
this
he
became
strongly
aware
now
that
the
girl
seemed
to
be
turning
from
him
if
he
lost
marian
he
would
indeed
be
a
lonely
man
for
he
considered
his
wife
of
no
account
intellectually
again
he
demanded
an
entire
allegiance
from
his
daughter
he
could
not
bear
to
think
that
her
zeal
on
his
behalf
was
diminishing
that
perhaps
she
was
beginning
to
regard
his
work
as
futile
and
antiquated
in
comparison
with
that
of
the
new
generation
yet
this
must
needs
be
the
result
of
frequent
intercourse
with
such
a
man
as
milvain
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
remarked
it
in
her
speech
and
manner
and
at
times
he
with
difficulty
restrained
himself
from
a
reproach
or
a
sarcasm
which
would
have
led
to
trouble
had
he
been
in
the
habit
of
dealing
harshly
with
marian
as
with
her
mother
of
course
his
position
would
have
been
simpler
but
he
had
always
respected
her
and
he
feared
to
lose
that
measure
of
respect
with
which
she
repaid
him
already
he
had
suffered
in
her
esteem
perhaps
more
than
he
liked
to
think
and
the
increasing
embitterment
of
his
temper
kept
him
always
in
danger
of
the
conflict
he
dreaded
marian
was
not
like
her
mother
she
could
not
submit
to
tyrannous
usage
warned
of
that
he
did
his
utmost
to
avoid
an
outbreak
of
discord
constantly
hoping
that
he
might
come
to
understand
his
daughter
s
position
and
perhaps
discover
that
his
greatest
fear
was
unfounded
twice
in
the
course
of
the
summer
he
inquired
of
his
wife
whether
she
knew
anything
about
the
milvains
but
mrs
yule
was
not
in
marian
s
confidence
i
only
know
that
she
goes
to
see
the
young
ladies
and
that
they
do
writing
of
some
she
never
even
mentions
their
brother
to
you
never
i
haven
t
heard
his
name
from
her
since
she
told
me
the
miss
milvains
weren
t
coming
here
he
was
not
sorry
that
marian
had
taken
the
decision
to
keep
her
friends
away
from
st
paul
s
crescent
for
it
saved
him
a
recurring
annoyance
but
on
the
other
hand
if
they
had
continued
to
come
he
would
not
have
been
thus
completely
in
the
dark
as
to
her
intercourse
with
jasper
scraps
of
information
must
now
and
then
have
been
gathered
by
his
wife
from
the
girls
talk
throughout
the
month
of
july
he
suffered
much
from
his
wonted
bilious
attacks
and
mrs
yule
had
to
endure
a
double
share
of
his
that
which
was
naturally
directed
against
her
and
that
of
which
marian
was
the
cause
in
august
things
were
slightly
better
but
with
the
return
to
labour
came
a
renewal
of
yule
s
sullenness
and
savageness
sundry
pieces
of
of
a
professional
kind
warnings
as
he
too
well
understood
that
it
was
growing
more
and
more
difficult
for
him
to
hold
his
own
against
the
new
writers
exasperated
his
quarrel
with
destiny
the
gloom
of
a
cold
and
stormy
september
was
doubly
wretched
in
that
house
on
the
far
borders
of
camden
town
but
in
october
the
sun
reappeared
and
it
seemed
to
mollify
the
literary
man
s
mood
just
when
mrs
yule
and
marian
began
to
hope
that
this
long
distemper
must
surely
come
to
an
end
there
befell
an
incident
which
at
the
best
of
times
would
have
occasioned
misery
and
which
in
the
present
juncture
proved
disastrous
it
was
one
morning
about
eleven
yule
was
in
his
study
marian
was
at
the
museum
mrs
yule
had
gone
shopping
there
came
a
sharp
knock
at
the
front
door
and
the
servant
on
opening
was
confronted
with
a
woman
who
asked
in
a
peremptory
voice
if
mrs
yule
was
at
home
no
then
is
mr
yule
yes
mum
but
i
m
afraid
he
s
i
don
t
care
i
must
see
him
say
that
mrs
goby
wants
to
see
him
at
the
servant
not
without
apprehensions
delivered
this
message
at
the
door
of
the
study
mrs
goby
who
is
mrs
goby
exclaimed
the
man
of
letters
irate
at
the
disturbance
there
sounded
an
answer
out
of
the
passage
for
the
visitor
had
followed
close
i
am
mrs
goby
of
the
olloway
road
wife
of
mr
goby
aberdasher
i
just
want
to
speak
to
you
mr
yule
if
you
please
seeing
that
mrs
yule
isn
t
yule
started
up
in
fury
and
stared
at
the
woman
to
whom
the
servant
had
reluctantly
given
place
what
business
can
you
have
with
me
if
you
wish
to
see
mrs
yule
come
again
when
she
is
at
no
mr
yule
i
will
not
come
again
cried
the
woman
red
in
the
face
i
thought
i
might
have
had
respectable
treatment
here
at
all
events
but
i
see
you
re
pretty
much
like
your
relations
in
the
way
of
behaving
to
people
though
you
do
wear
better
clothes
and
i
s
pose
call
yourself
a
gentleman
i
won
t
come
again
and
you
shall
just
hear
what
i
ve
got
to
say
she
closed
the
door
violently
and
stood
in
an
attitude
of
robust
defiance
what
s
all
this
about
asked
the
enraged
author
overcoming
an
impulse
to
take
mrs
goby
by
the
shoulders
and
throw
her
out
though
he
might
have
found
some
difficulty
in
achieving
this
feat
who
are
you
and
why
do
you
come
here
with
your
brawling
i
m
the
respectable
wife
of
a
respectable
man
that
s
who
i
am
mr
yule
if
you
want
to
know
and
i
always
thought
mrs
yule
was
the
same
from
the
dealings
we
ve
had
with
her
at
the
shop
though
not
knowing
any
more
of
her
it
s
true
except
that
she
lived
in
st
paul
s
crezzent
and
so
she
may
be
respectable
though
i
can
t
say
as
her
husband
behaves
himself
very
much
like
what
he
pretends
to
be
but
i
can
t
say
as
much
for
her
relations
in
perker
street
olloway
which
i
s
pose
they
re
your
relations
as
well
at
least
by
marriage
and
if
they
think
they
re
going
to
insult
me
and
use
their
blackguard
tongues
what
are
you
talking
about
shouted
yule
who
was
driven
to
frenzy
by
the
mention
of
his
wife
s
humble
family
what
have
i
to
do
with
these
people
what
have
you
to
do
with
them
i
s
pose
they
re
your
relations
ain
t
they
and
i
s
pose
the
girl
annie
rudd
is
your
niece
ain
t
she
at
least
she
s
your
wife
s
niece
and
that
comes
to
the
same
thing
i
ve
always
understood
though
i
dare
say
a
gentleman
as
has
so
many
books
about
him
can
correct
me
if
i
ve
made
a
she
looked
scornfully
though
also
with
some
surprise
round
the
volumed
walls
and
what
of
this
girl
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
say
what
your
business
is
yes
i
will
have
the
goodness
i
s
pose
you
know
very
well
that
i
took
your
niece
annie
rudd
as
a
domestic
servant
she
repeated
this
precise
definition
as
a
domestic
servant
because
mrs
yule
appened
to
arst
me
if
i
knew
of
a
place
for
a
girl
of
that
kind
as
hadn
t
been
out
before
but
could
be
trusted
to
do
her
best
to
give
satisfaction
to
a
good
mistress
i
s
pose
you
know
that
i
know
nothing
of
the
kind
what
have
i
to
do
with
servants
well
whether
you
ve
much
to
do
with
them
or
little
that
s
how
it
was
and
nicely
she
s
paid
me
out
has
your
niece
miss
rudd
of
all
the
trouble
i
ever
had
with
a
girl
and
now
when
she
s
run
away
back
ome
and
when
i
take
the
trouble
to
go
arfter
her
i
m
to
be
insulted
and
abused
as
never
was
oh
they
re
a
nice
respectable
family
those
rudds
mrs
rudd
that
s
mrs
yule
s
sister
what
a
nice
lady
she
is
to
be
sure
if
i
was
to
repeat
the
language
but
there
i
wouldn
t
lower
myself
and
i
ve
been
a
brute
of
a
mistress
i
my
servants
and
i
don
t
give
em
enough
to
eat
and
i
pay
em
worse
than
any
woman
in
london
that
s
what
i
ve
learnt
about
myself
by
going
to
perker
street
olloway
and
when
i
come
here
to
ask
mrs
yule
what
she
means
by
recommending
such
a
creature
from
such
a
ome
i
get
insulted
by
her
gentleman
yule
was
livid
with
rage
but
the
extremity
of
his
scorn
withheld
him
from
utterance
of
what
he
felt
as
i
said
all
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
i
will
let
mrs
yule
know
that
you
have
called
i
have
no
more
time
to
mrs
goby
repeated
at
still
greater
length
the
details
of
her
grievance
but
long
before
she
had
finished
yule
was
sitting
again
at
his
desk
in
ostentatious
disregard
of
her
finally
the
exasperated
woman
flung
open
the
door
railed
in
a
loud
voice
along
the
passage
and
left
the
house
with
an
alarming
crash
it
was
not
long
before
mrs
yule
returned
before
taking
off
her
things
she
went
down
into
the
kitchen
with
certain
purchases
and
there
she
learnt
from
the
servant
what
had
happened
during
her
absence
fear
and
trembling
possessed
her
the
sick
faint
dread
always
excited
by
her
husband
s
wrath
but
she
felt
obliged
to
go
at
once
to
the
study
the
scene
that
took
place
there
was
one
of
ignoble
violence
on
yule
s
part
and
on
that
of
his
wife
of
terrified
changing
at
length
to
dolorous
resentment
of
the
harshness
with
which
she
was
treated
when
it
was
over
yule
took
his
hat
and
went
out
he
did
not
return
for
the
meal
and
when
marian
late
in
the
afternoon
came
back
from
the
museum
he
was
still
absent
not
finding
her
mother
in
the
parlour
marian
called
at
the
head
of
the
kitchen
stairs
the
servant
answered
saying
that
mrs
yule
was
up
in
her
bedroom
and
that
she
didn
t
seem
well
marian
at
once
went
up
and
knocked
at
the
bedroom
door
in
a
moment
or
two
her
mother
came
out
showing
a
face
of
tearful
misery
what
is
it
mother
what
s
the
matter
they
went
into
marian
s
room
where
mrs
yule
gave
free
utterance
to
her
lamentations
i
can
t
put
up
with
it
marian
your
father
is
too
hard
with
me
i
was
wrong
i
dare
say
and
i
might
have
known
what
would
have
come
of
it
but
he
couldn
t
speak
to
me
worse
if
i
did
him
all
the
harm
i
could
on
purpose
it
s
all
about
annie
because
i
found
a
place
for
her
at
mrs
goby
s
in
the
olloway
road
and
now
mrs
goby
s
been
here
and
seen
your
father
and
told
him
she
s
been
insulted
by
the
rudds
because
annie
went
off
home
and
she
went
after
her
to
make
inquiries
and
your
father
s
in
such
a
passion
about
it
as
never
was
that
woman
mrs
goby
rushed
into
the
study
when
he
was
working
it
was
this
morning
when
i
happened
to
be
out
and
she
throws
all
the
blame
on
me
for
recommending
her
such
a
girl
and
i
did
it
for
the
best
that
i
did
annie
promised
me
faithfully
she
d
behave
well
and
never
give
me
trouble
and
she
seemed
thankful
to
me
because
she
wasn
t
happy
at
home
and
now
to
think
of
her
causing
all
this
disturbance
i
oughtn
t
to
have
done
such
a
thing
without
speaking
about
it
to
your
father
but
you
know
how
afraid
i
am
to
say
a
word
to
him
about
those
people
and
my
sister
s
told
me
so
often
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
never
helping
her
and
her
children
she
thinks
i
could
do
such
a
lot
if
i
only
liked
and
now
that
i
did
try
to
do
something
see
what
comes
of
it
marian
listened
with
a
confusion
of
wretched
feelings
but
her
sympathies
were
strongly
with
her
mother
as
well
as
she
could
understand
the
broken
story
her
father
seemed
to
have
no
just
cause
for
his
pitiless
rage
though
such
an
occasion
would
be
likely
enough
to
bring
out
his
worst
faults
is
he
in
the
study
she
asked
no
he
went
out
at
twelve
o
clock
and
he
s
never
been
back
since
i
feel
as
if
i
must
do
something
i
can
t
bear
with
it
marian
he
tells
me
i
m
the
curse
of
his
life
yes
he
said
that
i
oughtn
t
to
tell
you
i
know
i
oughtn
t
but
it
s
more
than
i
can
bear
i
ve
always
tried
to
do
my
best
but
it
gets
harder
and
harder
for
me
but
for
me
he
d
never
be
in
these
bad
tempers
it
s
because
he
can
t
look
at
me
without
getting
angry
he
says
i
ve
kept
him
back
all
through
his
life
but
for
me
he
might
have
been
far
better
off
than
he
is
it
may
be
true
i
ve
often
enough
thought
it
but
i
can
t
bear
to
have
it
told
me
like
that
and
to
see
it
in
his
face
every
time
he
looks
at
me
i
shall
have
to
do
something
he
d
be
glad
if
only
i
was
out
of
his
father
has
no
right
to
make
you
so
unhappy
said
marian
i
can
t
see
that
you
did
anything
blameworthy
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
your
duty
to
try
and
help
annie
and
if
it
turned
out
unfortunately
that
can
t
be
helped
you
oughtn
t
to
think
so
much
of
what
father
says
in
his
anger
i
believe
he
hardly
knows
what
he
does
say
don
t
take
it
so
much
to
heart
i
ve
tried
my
best
marian
sobbed
the
poor
woman
who
felt
that
even
her
child
s
sympathy
could
not
be
perfect
owing
to
the
distance
put
between
them
by
marian
s
education
and
refined
sensibilities
i
ve
always
thought
it
wasn
t
right
to
talk
to
you
about
such
things
but
he
s
been
too
hard
with
me
i
think
it
was
better
you
should
tell
me
it
can
t
go
on
like
this
i
feel
that
just
as
you
do
i
must
tell
father
that
he
is
making
our
lives
a
burden
to
oh
you
mustn
t
speak
to
him
like
that
marian
i
wouldn
t
for
anything
make
unkindness
between
you
and
your
father
that
would
be
the
worst
thing
i
d
done
yet
i
d
rather
go
away
and
work
for
my
own
living
than
make
trouble
between
you
and
it
isn
t
you
who
make
trouble
it
s
father
i
ought
to
have
spoken
to
him
before
this
i
had
no
right
to
stand
by
and
see
how
much
you
suffered
from
his
the
longer
they
talked
the
firmer
grew
marian
s
resolve
to
front
her
father
s
tyrannous
and
in
one
way
or
another
to
change
the
intolerable
state
of
things
she
had
been
weak
to
hold
her
peace
so
long
at
her
age
it
was
a
simple
duty
to
interfere
when
her
mother
was
treated
with
such
flagrant
injustice
her
father
s
behaviour
was
unworthy
of
a
thinking
man
and
he
must
be
made
to
feel
that
yule
did
not
return
dinner
was
delayed
for
half
an
hour
then
marian
declared
that
they
would
wait
no
longer
they
two
made
a
sorry
meal
and
afterwards
went
together
into
the
at
eight
o
clock
they
heard
the
front
door
open
and
yule
s
footstep
in
the
passage
marian
rose
don
t
speak
till
whispered
her
mother
catching
at
the
girl
s
arm
let
it
be
till
marian
i
must
speak
we
can
t
live
in
this
she
reached
the
study
just
as
her
father
was
closing
the
door
behind
him
yule
seeing
her
enter
glared
with
bloodshot
eyes
shame
and
sullen
anger
were
blended
on
his
countenance
will
you
tell
me
what
is
wrong
father
marian
asked
in
a
voice
which
betrayed
her
nervous
suffering
yet
indicated
the
resolve
with
which
she
had
come
i
am
not
at
all
disposed
to
talk
of
the
matter
he
replied
with
the
awkward
rotundity
of
phrase
which
distinguished
him
in
his
worst
humour
for
information
you
had
better
go
to
mrs
goby
or
a
person
of
some
such
name
in
holloway
road
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
it
was
very
unfortunate
that
the
woman
came
and
troubled
you
about
such
things
but
i
can
t
see
that
mother
was
to
blame
i
don
t
think
you
ought
to
be
so
angry
with
it
cost
marian
a
terrible
effort
to
address
her
father
in
these
terms
when
he
turned
fiercely
upon
her
she
shrank
back
and
felt
as
if
strength
must
fail
her
even
to
stand
you
can
t
see
that
she
was
to
blame
isn
t
it
entirely
against
my
wish
that
she
keeps
up
any
intercourse
with
those
low
people
am
i
to
be
exposed
to
insulting
disturbance
in
my
very
study
because
she
chooses
to
introduce
girls
of
bad
character
as
servants
to
vulgar
women
i
don
t
think
annie
rudd
can
be
called
a
girl
of
bad
character
and
it
was
very
natural
that
mother
should
try
to
do
something
for
her
you
have
never
actually
forbidden
her
to
see
her
a
thousand
times
i
have
given
her
to
understand
that
i
utterly
disapproved
of
such
association
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
this
girl
was
as
likely
as
not
to
discredit
her
if
she
had
consulted
me
i
should
at
once
have
forbidden
anything
of
the
kind
she
was
aware
of
that
she
kept
it
secret
from
me
knowing
that
it
would
excite
my
displeasure
i
will
not
be
drawn
into
such
squalid
affairs
i
won
t
have
my
name
spoken
in
such
connection
your
mother
has
only
herself
to
blame
if
i
am
angry
with
your
anger
goes
beyond
all
bounds
at
the
very
worst
mother
behaved
imprudently
and
with
a
very
good
motive
it
is
cruel
that
you
should
make
her
suffer
as
she
is
marian
was
being
strengthened
to
resist
her
blood
grew
hot
the
sensation
which
once
before
had
brought
her
to
the
verge
of
conflict
with
her
father
possessed
her
heart
and
brain
you
are
not
a
suitable
judge
of
my
behaviour
replied
yule
severely
i
am
driven
to
speak
we
can
t
go
on
living
in
this
way
father
for
months
our
home
has
been
almost
ceaselessly
wretched
because
of
the
you
are
always
in
mother
and
i
must
defend
ourselves
we
can
t
bear
it
any
longer
you
must
surely
feel
how
ridiculous
it
is
to
make
such
a
thing
as
happened
this
morning
the
excuse
for
violent
anger
how
can
i
help
judging
your
behaviour
when
mother
is
brought
to
the
point
of
saying
that
she
would
rather
leave
home
and
everything
than
endure
her
misery
any
longer
i
should
be
wrong
if
i
didn
t
speak
to
you
why
are
you
so
unkind
what
serious
cause
has
mother
ever
given
you
i
refuse
to
argue
such
questions
with
then
you
are
very
unjust
i
am
not
a
child
and
there
s
nothing
wrong
in
my
asking
you
why
home
is
made
a
place
of
misery
instead
of
being
what
home
ought
to
you
prove
that
you
are
a
child
in
asking
for
explanations
which
ought
to
be
clear
enough
to
you
mean
that
mother
is
to
blame
for
everything
the
subject
is
no
fit
one
to
be
discussed
between
a
father
and
his
daughter
if
you
can
not
see
the
impropriety
of
it
be
so
good
as
to
go
away
and
reflect
and
leave
me
to
my
marian
came
to
a
pause
but
she
knew
that
his
rebuke
was
mere
unworthy
evasion
she
saw
that
her
father
could
not
meet
her
look
and
this
perception
of
shame
in
him
impelled
her
to
finish
what
she
had
begun
i
will
say
nothing
of
mother
then
but
speak
only
for
myself
i
suffer
too
much
from
your
unkindness
you
ask
too
much
you
mean
that
i
exact
too
much
work
from
you
asked
her
father
with
a
look
which
might
have
been
directed
to
a
recalcitrant
clerk
no
but
that
you
make
the
conditions
of
my
work
too
hard
i
live
in
constant
fear
of
your
indeed
when
did
i
last
you
or
threaten
you
i
often
think
that
threats
or
even
would
be
easier
to
bear
than
an
unchanging
gloom
which
always
seems
on
the
point
of
breaking
into
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
your
criticism
of
my
disposition
and
manner
but
unhappily
i
am
too
old
to
reform
life
has
made
me
what
i
am
and
i
should
have
thought
that
your
knowledge
of
what
my
life
has
been
would
have
gone
far
to
excuse
a
lack
of
cheerfulness
in
the
irony
of
this
laborious
period
was
full
of
his
voice
quavered
at
the
close
and
a
tremor
was
noticeable
in
his
stiff
frame
it
isn
t
lack
of
cheerfulness
that
i
mean
father
that
could
never
have
brought
me
to
speak
like
if
you
wish
me
to
admit
that
i
am
surly
irritable
i
make
no
difficulty
about
that
the
charge
is
true
enough
i
can
only
ask
you
again
what
are
the
circumstances
that
have
ruined
my
temper
when
you
present
yourself
here
with
a
general
accusation
of
my
behaviour
i
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
you
ask
of
me
what
you
wish
me
to
say
or
do
i
must
beg
you
to
speak
plainly
are
you
suggesting
that
i
should
make
provision
for
the
support
of
you
and
your
mother
away
from
my
intolerable
proximity
my
income
is
not
large
as
i
think
you
are
aware
but
of
course
if
a
demand
of
this
kind
is
seriously
made
i
must
do
my
best
to
comply
with
it
hurts
me
very
much
that
you
can
understand
me
no
better
than
i
am
sorry
i
think
we
used
to
understand
each
other
but
that
was
before
you
were
subjected
to
the
influence
of
in
his
perverse
frame
of
mind
he
was
ready
to
give
utterance
to
any
thought
which
confused
the
point
at
issue
this
last
allusion
was
suggested
to
him
by
a
sudden
pang
of
regret
for
the
pain
he
was
causing
marian
he
defended
himself
against
by
hinting
at
the
true
reason
of
much
of
his
harshness
i
am
subjected
to
no
influence
that
is
hostile
to
you
marian
replied
you
may
think
that
but
in
such
a
matter
it
is
very
easy
for
you
to
deceive
of
course
i
know
what
you
refer
to
and
i
can
assure
you
that
i
don
t
deceive
yule
flashed
a
searching
glance
at
her
can
you
deny
that
you
are
on
terms
of
friendship
with
a
a
person
who
would
at
any
moment
rejoice
to
injure
me
i
am
friendly
with
no
such
person
will
you
say
whom
you
are
thinking
of
it
would
be
useless
i
have
no
wish
to
discuss
a
subject
on
which
we
should
only
disagree
marian
kept
silence
for
a
moment
then
said
in
a
low
unsteady
voice
it
is
perhaps
because
we
never
speak
of
that
subject
that
we
are
so
far
from
understanding
each
other
if
you
think
that
mr
milvain
is
your
enemy
that
he
would
rejoice
to
injure
you
you
are
grievously
when
i
see
a
man
in
close
alliance
with
my
worst
enemy
and
looking
to
that
enemy
for
favour
i
am
justified
in
thinking
that
he
would
injure
me
if
the
right
kind
of
opportunity
offered
one
need
not
be
very
deeply
read
in
human
nature
to
have
assurance
of
but
i
know
mr
milvain
you
know
him
far
better
than
you
can
i
am
sure
you
draw
conclusions
from
general
principles
but
i
know
that
they
don
t
apply
in
this
i
have
no
doubt
you
sincerely
think
so
i
repeat
that
nothing
can
be
gained
by
such
a
discussion
as
one
thing
i
must
tell
you
there
was
no
truth
in
your
suspicion
that
mr
milvain
wrote
that
review
in
the
current
he
assured
me
himself
that
he
was
not
the
writer
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
yule
looked
askance
at
her
and
his
face
displayed
solicitude
which
soon
passed
however
into
a
smile
of
sarcasm
the
gentleman
s
word
no
doubt
has
weight
with
father
what
do
you
mean
broke
from
marian
whose
eyes
of
a
sudden
flashed
stormily
would
mr
milvain
tell
me
a
lie
i
shouldn
t
like
to
say
that
it
is
impossible
replied
her
father
in
the
same
tone
as
before
but
what
right
have
you
to
insult
him
so
grossly
i
have
every
right
my
dear
child
to
express
an
opinion
about
him
or
any
other
man
provided
i
do
it
honestly
i
beg
you
not
to
strike
attitudes
and
address
me
in
the
language
of
the
stage
you
insist
on
my
speaking
plainly
and
i
have
spoken
plainly
i
warned
you
that
we
were
not
likely
to
agree
on
this
literary
quarrels
have
made
you
incapable
of
judging
honestly
in
things
such
as
this
i
wish
i
could
have
done
for
ever
with
the
hateful
profession
that
so
poisons
men
s
believe
me
my
girl
said
her
father
incisively
the
simpler
thing
would
be
to
hold
aloof
from
such
people
as
use
the
profession
in
a
spirit
of
unalloyed
selfishness
who
seek
only
material
advancement
and
who
whatever
connection
they
form
have
nothing
but
in
and
he
glared
at
her
with
much
meaning
marian
both
had
remained
standing
all
through
the
dialogue
cast
down
her
eyes
and
became
lost
in
brooding
i
speak
with
profound
conviction
pursued
her
father
and
however
little
you
credit
me
with
such
a
motive
out
of
desire
to
guard
you
against
the
dangers
to
which
your
inexperience
is
exposed
it
is
perhaps
as
well
that
you
have
afforded
me
this
there
sounded
at
the
that
duplicated
which
generally
announces
the
bearer
of
a
telegram
yule
interrupted
himself
and
stood
in
an
attitude
of
waiting
the
servant
was
heard
to
go
along
the
passage
to
open
the
door
and
then
return
towards
the
study
yes
it
was
a
telegram
such
despatches
rarely
came
to
this
house
yule
tore
the
envelope
read
its
contents
and
stood
with
gaze
fixed
upon
the
slip
of
paper
until
the
servant
inquired
if
there
was
any
reply
for
the
boy
to
take
with
him
no
he
slowly
crumpled
the
envelope
and
stepped
aside
to
throw
it
into
the
the
telegram
he
laid
on
his
desk
marian
stood
all
the
time
with
bent
head
he
now
looked
at
her
with
an
expression
of
meditative
displeasure
i
don
t
know
that
there
s
much
good
in
resuming
our
conversation
he
said
in
quite
a
changed
tone
as
if
something
of
more
importance
had
taken
possession
of
his
thoughts
and
had
made
him
almost
indifferent
to
the
past
dispute
but
of
course
i
am
quite
willing
to
hear
anything
you
would
still
like
to
say
marian
had
lost
her
vehemence
she
was
absent
and
melancholy
i
can
only
ask
you
she
replied
to
try
and
make
life
less
of
a
burden
to
i
shall
have
to
leave
town
for
a
few
days
no
doubt
it
will
be
some
satisfaction
to
you
to
hear
marian
s
eyes
turned
involuntarily
towards
the
telegram
as
for
your
occupation
in
my
absence
he
went
on
in
a
hard
tone
which
yet
had
something
tremulous
emotional
making
it
quite
different
from
the
voice
he
had
hitherto
used
that
will
be
entirely
a
matter
for
your
own
judgment
i
have
felt
for
some
time
that
you
assisted
me
with
less
than
formerly
and
now
that
you
have
frankly
admitted
it
i
shall
of
course
have
very
little
satisfaction
in
requesting
your
aid
i
must
leave
it
to
you
consult
your
own
it
was
resentful
but
not
savage
between
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
his
speech
he
softened
to
a
sort
of
pathos
i
can
t
pretend
replied
marian
that
i
have
as
much
pleasure
in
the
work
as
i
should
have
if
your
mood
were
i
am
sorry
i
might
perhaps
have
made
greater
efforts
to
appear
at
ease
when
i
was
do
you
mean
physical
suffering
physical
and
mental
but
that
can
t
concern
you
during
my
absence
i
will
think
of
your
reproof
i
know
that
it
is
deserved
in
some
degree
if
it
is
possible
you
shall
have
less
to
complain
of
in
he
looked
about
the
room
and
at
length
seated
himself
his
eyes
were
fixed
in
a
direction
away
from
marian
i
suppose
you
had
dinner
somewhere
marian
asked
after
catching
a
glimpse
of
his
worn
colourless
face
oh
i
had
a
mouthful
of
something
it
doesn
t
it
seemed
as
if
he
found
some
special
pleasure
in
assuming
this
tone
of
martyrdom
just
now
at
the
same
time
he
was
becoming
more
absorbed
in
thought
shall
i
have
something
brought
up
for
you
father
something
oh
no
no
on
no
he
rose
again
impatiently
then
approached
his
desk
and
laid
a
hand
on
the
telegram
marian
observed
this
movement
and
examined
his
face
it
was
set
in
an
expression
of
eagerness
you
have
nothing
more
to
say
then
he
turned
sharply
upon
her
i
feel
that
i
haven
t
made
you
understand
me
but
i
can
say
nothing
i
understand
you
very
well
too
well
that
you
should
misunderstand
and
mistrust
me
i
suppose
is
natural
you
are
young
and
i
am
old
you
are
still
full
of
hope
and
i
have
been
so
often
deceived
and
defeated
that
i
dare
not
let
a
ray
of
hope
enter
my
mind
judge
me
judge
me
as
hardly
as
you
like
my
life
has
been
one
long
bitter
struggle
and
if
now
i
say
he
began
a
new
sentence
that
only
the
hard
side
of
life
has
been
shown
to
me
small
wonder
if
i
have
become
hard
myself
desert
me
go
your
own
way
as
the
young
always
do
but
bear
in
mind
my
warning
remember
the
caution
i
have
given
he
spoke
in
a
strangely
sudden
agitation
the
arm
with
which
he
leaned
upon
the
table
trembled
violently
after
a
moment
s
pause
he
added
in
a
thick
voice
leave
me
i
will
speak
to
you
again
in
the
impressed
in
a
way
she
did
not
understand
marian
at
once
obeyed
and
rejoined
her
mother
in
the
parlour
mrs
yule
gazed
anxiously
at
her
as
she
entered
don
t
be
afraid
said
marian
with
difficulty
bringing
herself
to
speak
i
think
it
will
be
was
that
a
telegram
that
came
her
mother
inquired
after
a
silence
yes
i
don
t
know
where
it
was
from
but
father
said
he
would
have
to
leave
town
for
a
few
they
exchanged
looks
perhaps
your
uncle
is
very
ill
said
the
mother
in
a
low
voice
perhaps
the
evening
passed
drearily
fatigued
with
her
emotions
marian
went
early
to
bed
she
even
slept
later
than
usual
in
the
morning
and
on
descending
she
found
her
father
already
at
the
no
greeting
passed
and
there
was
no
conversation
during
the
meal
marian
noticed
that
her
mother
kept
glancing
at
her
in
a
peculiarly
grave
way
but
she
felt
ill
and
dejected
and
could
fix
her
thoughts
on
no
subject
as
he
left
the
table
yule
said
to
her
i
want
to
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
i
shall
be
in
the
she
joined
him
there
very
soon
he
looked
coldly
at
her
and
said
in
a
distant
tone
the
telegram
last
night
was
to
tell
me
that
your
uncle
is
dead
he
died
of
apoplexy
at
a
meeting
in
wattleborough
i
shall
go
down
this
morning
and
of
course
remain
till
after
the
funeral
i
see
no
necessity
for
your
going
unless
of
course
it
is
your
desire
to
do
no
i
should
do
as
you
i
think
you
had
better
not
go
to
the
museum
whilst
i
am
away
you
will
occupy
yourself
as
you
think
i
shall
go
on
with
the
harrington
as
you
please
i
don
t
know
what
mourning
it
would
be
decent
for
you
to
wear
you
must
consult
with
your
mother
about
that
that
is
all
i
wished
to
his
tone
was
dismissal
marian
had
a
struggle
with
herself
but
she
could
find
nothing
to
reply
to
his
cold
phrases
and
an
hour
or
two
afterwards
yule
left
the
house
without
soon
after
his
departure
there
was
a
visitor
s
at
the
door
it
heralded
mrs
goby
in
the
interview
which
then
took
place
marian
assisted
her
mother
to
bear
the
vigorous
onslaughts
of
the
haberdasher
s
wife
for
more
than
two
hours
mrs
goby
related
her
grievances
against
the
fugitive
servant
against
mrs
yule
against
mr
yule
meeting
with
no
irritating
opposition
she
was
able
in
this
space
of
time
to
cool
down
to
the
temperature
of
normal
intercourse
and
when
she
went
forth
from
the
house
again
it
was
in
a
mood
of
dignified
displeasure
which
she
felt
to
be
some
recompense
for
the
injuries
of
yesterday
a
result
of
this
annoyance
was
to
postpone
conversation
between
mother
and
daughter
on
the
subject
of
john
yule
s
death
until
a
late
hour
of
the
afternoon
marian
was
at
work
in
the
study
or
endeavouring
to
work
for
her
thoughts
would
not
fix
themselves
on
the
matter
in
hand
for
many
minutes
together
and
mrs
yule
came
in
with
more
than
her
customary
diffidence
have
you
nearly
done
for
dear
enough
for
the
present
i
she
laid
down
her
pen
and
leant
back
in
the
chair
marian
do
you
think
your
father
will
be
rich
i
have
no
idea
mother
i
suppose
we
shall
know
very
her
tone
was
dreamy
she
seemed
to
herself
to
be
speaking
of
something
which
scarcely
at
all
concerned
her
of
vague
possibilities
which
did
not
affect
her
habits
of
thought
if
that
happens
continued
mrs
yule
in
a
low
tone
of
distress
i
don
t
know
what
i
shall
marian
looked
at
her
questioningly
i
can
t
wish
that
it
mayn
t
happen
her
mother
went
on
i
can
t
for
his
sake
and
for
yours
but
i
don
t
know
what
i
shall
do
he
d
think
me
more
in
his
way
than
ever
he
d
wish
to
have
a
large
house
and
live
in
quite
a
different
way
and
how
could
i
manage
then
i
couldn
t
show
myself
he
d
be
too
much
ashamed
of
me
i
shouldn
t
be
in
my
place
even
you
d
feel
ashamed
of
you
mustn
t
say
that
mother
i
have
never
given
you
cause
to
think
no
my
dear
you
haven
t
but
it
would
be
only
natural
i
couldn
t
live
the
kind
of
life
that
you
re
fit
for
i
shall
be
nothing
but
a
hindrance
and
a
shame
to
both
of
to
me
you
would
never
be
either
hindrance
or
shame
be
quite
sure
of
that
and
as
for
father
i
am
all
but
certain
that
if
he
became
rich
he
would
be
a
very
much
kinder
man
a
better
man
in
every
way
it
is
poverty
that
has
made
him
worse
than
he
naturally
is
it
has
that
effect
on
almost
everybody
money
does
harm
too
sometimes
but
never
i
think
to
people
who
have
a
good
heart
and
a
strong
mind
father
is
naturally
a
man
riches
would
bring
out
all
the
best
in
him
he
would
be
generous
again
which
he
has
almost
forgotten
how
to
be
among
all
his
disappointments
and
battlings
don
t
be
afraid
of
that
change
but
hope
for
mrs
yule
gave
a
troublous
sigh
and
for
a
few
minutes
pondered
anxiously
i
wasn
t
thinking
so
much
about
myself
she
said
at
length
it
s
the
hindrance
i
should
be
to
father
just
because
of
me
he
mightn
t
be
able
to
use
his
money
as
he
d
wish
he
d
always
be
feeling
that
if
it
wasn
t
for
me
things
would
be
so
much
better
for
him
and
for
you
as
you
must
remember
marian
replied
that
at
father
s
age
people
don
t
care
to
make
such
great
changes
his
home
life
i
feel
sure
wouldn
t
be
so
very
different
from
what
it
is
now
he
would
prefer
to
use
his
money
in
starting
a
paper
or
magazine
i
know
that
would
be
his
first
thought
if
more
acquaintances
came
to
his
house
what
would
that
matter
it
isn
t
as
if
he
wished
for
fashionable
society
they
would
be
literary
people
and
why
ever
shouldn
t
you
meet
with
them
i
ve
always
been
the
reason
why
he
couldn
t
have
many
that
s
a
great
mistake
if
father
ever
said
that
in
his
bad
temper
he
knew
it
wasn
t
the
truth
the
chief
reason
has
always
been
his
poverty
it
costs
money
to
entertain
friends
time
as
well
don
t
think
in
this
anxious
way
mother
if
we
are
to
be
rich
it
will
be
better
for
all
of
marian
had
every
reason
for
seeking
to
persuade
herself
that
this
was
true
in
her
own
heart
there
was
a
fear
of
how
wealth
might
affect
her
father
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
face
the
darker
prospect
for
her
so
much
depended
on
that
hope
of
a
revival
of
generous
feeling
under
sunny
influences
it
was
only
after
this
conversation
that
she
began
to
reflect
on
all
the
possible
consequences
of
her
uncle
s
death
as
yet
she
had
been
too
much
disturbed
to
grasp
as
a
reality
the
event
to
which
she
had
often
looked
forward
though
as
to
something
still
remote
and
of
quite
uncertain
results
perhaps
at
this
moment
though
she
could
not
know
it
the
course
of
her
life
had
undergone
the
most
important
change
perhaps
there
was
no
more
need
for
her
to
labour
upon
this
article
she
was
manufacturing
she
did
not
think
it
probable
that
she
herself
would
benefit
directly
by
john
yule
s
will
there
was
no
certainty
that
even
her
father
would
for
he
and
his
brother
had
never
been
on
cordial
terms
but
on
the
whole
it
seemed
likely
that
he
would
inherit
money
enough
to
free
him
from
the
toil
of
writing
for
periodicals
he
himself
anticipated
that
what
else
could
be
the
meaning
of
those
words
in
which
and
it
was
before
the
arrival
of
the
news
he
had
warned
her
against
people
who
made
connections
only
with
in
view
this
threw
a
sudden
light
upon
her
father
s
attitude
towards
jasper
milvain
evidently
he
thought
that
jasper
regarded
her
as
a
possible
heiress
sooner
or
later
that
suspicion
was
rankling
in
his
mind
doubtless
it
intensified
the
prejudice
which
originated
in
literary
animosity
was
there
any
truth
in
his
suspicion
she
did
not
shrink
from
admitting
that
there
might
be
jasper
had
from
the
first
been
so
frank
with
her
had
so
often
repeated
that
money
was
at
present
his
chief
need
if
her
father
inherited
substantial
property
would
it
induce
jasper
to
declare
himself
more
than
her
friend
she
could
view
the
possibility
of
that
and
yet
not
for
a
moment
be
shaken
in
her
love
it
was
plain
that
jasper
could
not
think
of
marrying
until
his
position
and
prospects
were
greatly
improved
practically
his
sisters
depended
upon
him
what
folly
it
would
be
to
draw
back
if
circumstances
led
him
to
avow
what
hitherto
he
had
so
slightly
disguised
she
had
the
conviction
that
he
valued
her
for
her
own
sake
if
the
obstacle
between
them
could
only
be
removed
what
matter
how
would
he
be
willing
to
abandon
clement
fadge
and
come
over
to
her
father
s
side
if
yule
were
able
to
found
a
magazine
had
she
read
or
heard
of
a
girl
who
went
so
far
in
concessions
marian
would
have
turned
away
her
delicacy
offended
in
her
own
case
she
could
indulge
to
the
utmost
that
practicality
which
colours
a
woman
s
thought
even
in
mid
passion
the
cold
exhibition
of
ignoble
scheming
will
repel
many
a
woman
who
for
her
own
heart
s
desire
is
capable
of
that
same
compromise
with
her
strict
sense
of
honour
marian
wrote
to
dora
milvain
telling
her
what
had
happened
but
she
refrained
from
visiting
her
friends
each
night
found
her
more
restless
each
morning
less
able
to
employ
herself
she
shut
herself
in
the
study
merely
to
be
alone
with
her
thoughts
to
be
able
to
walk
backwards
and
forwards
or
sit
for
hours
in
feverish
reverie
from
her
father
came
no
news
her
mother
was
suffering
dreadfully
from
suspense
and
often
had
eyes
red
with
weeping
absorbed
in
her
own
hopes
and
fears
whilst
every
hour
harassed
her
more
intolerably
marian
was
unable
to
play
the
part
of
an
encourager
she
had
never
known
such
exclusiveness
of
yule
s
return
was
unannounced
early
in
the
afternoon
when
he
had
been
absent
five
days
he
entered
the
house
deposited
his
in
the
passage
and
went
upstairs
marian
had
come
out
of
the
study
just
in
time
to
see
him
up
on
the
first
landing
at
the
same
moment
mrs
yule
ascended
from
the
kitchen
wasn
t
that
father
yes
he
has
gone
did
he
say
anything
marian
shook
her
head
they
looked
at
the
then
went
into
the
parlour
and
waited
in
silence
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
yule
s
foot
was
heard
on
the
stairs
he
came
down
slowly
paused
in
the
passage
entered
the
parlour
with
his
usual
grave
cold
countenance
chapter
xxii
the
legatees
each
day
jasper
came
to
inquire
of
his
sisters
if
they
had
news
from
wattleborough
or
from
marian
yule
he
exhibited
no
impatience
spoke
of
the
matter
in
a
disinterested
tone
still
he
came
daily
one
afternoon
he
found
dora
working
alone
maud
he
was
told
had
gone
to
lunch
at
mrs
lane
s
so
soon
again
she
s
getting
very
thick
with
those
people
and
why
don
t
they
ask
you
maud
has
told
them
that
i
don
t
care
to
go
it
s
all
very
well
but
she
mustn
t
neglect
her
work
did
she
write
anything
last
night
or
this
morning
dora
bit
the
end
of
her
pen
and
shook
her
head
why
not
the
invitation
came
about
five
o
clock
and
it
seemed
to
unsettle
precisely
that
s
what
i
m
afraid
of
she
isn
t
the
kind
of
girl
to
stick
at
work
if
people
begin
to
send
her
invitations
but
i
tell
you
what
it
is
you
must
talk
seriously
to
her
she
has
to
get
her
living
you
know
mrs
lane
and
her
set
are
not
likely
to
be
much
use
that
s
the
worst
of
it
they
ll
merely
waste
her
time
and
make
her
his
sister
executed
an
elaborate
bit
of
on
some
waste
paper
her
lips
were
drawn
together
and
her
brows
wrinkled
at
length
she
broke
the
silence
by
saying
marian
hasn
t
been
jasper
seemed
to
pay
no
attention
she
looked
up
at
him
and
saw
that
he
was
in
thought
did
you
go
to
those
people
last
night
she
inquired
yes
miss
rupert
was
he
spoke
as
if
the
name
would
be
familiar
to
his
hearer
but
dora
seemed
at
a
loss
who
is
miss
rupert
didn
t
i
tell
you
about
her
i
thought
i
did
oh
i
met
her
first
of
all
at
barlow
s
just
after
we
got
back
from
the
seaside
rather
an
interesting
girl
she
s
a
daughter
of
manton
rupert
the
advertising
agent
i
want
to
get
invited
to
their
house
useful
people
you
but
is
an
advertising
agent
a
gentleman
jasper
laughed
do
you
think
of
him
as
a
at
all
events
he
is
enormously
wealthy
and
has
a
magnificent
house
at
chislehurst
the
girl
goes
about
with
her
stepmother
i
call
her
a
girl
but
she
must
be
nearly
thirty
and
mrs
rupert
looks
only
two
or
three
years
older
i
had
quite
a
long
talk
with
her
miss
rupert
i
mean
last
night
she
told
me
she
was
going
to
stay
next
week
with
the
barlows
so
i
shall
have
a
run
out
to
wimbledon
one
dora
looked
at
him
inquiringly
just
to
see
miss
rupert
she
asked
meeting
his
eyes
to
be
sure
why
not
oh
ejaculated
his
sister
as
if
the
question
did
not
concern
her
she
isn
t
exactly
pursued
jasper
meditatively
with
a
quick
glance
at
the
listener
but
fairly
intellectual
plays
very
well
and
has
a
nice
contralto
voice
she
sang
that
new
thing
of
tosti
s
what
do
you
call
it
i
thought
her
rather
masculine
when
i
first
saw
her
but
the
impression
wears
off
when
one
knows
her
better
she
rather
takes
to
me
i
but
began
dora
after
a
minute
s
silence
but
what
inquired
her
brother
with
an
air
of
interest
i
don
t
quite
understand
in
general
or
with
reference
to
some
particular
what
right
have
you
to
go
to
places
just
to
see
this
miss
rupert
what
right
he
laughed
i
am
a
young
man
with
my
way
to
make
i
can
t
afford
to
lose
any
opportunity
if
miss
rupert
is
so
good
as
to
take
an
interest
in
me
i
have
no
objection
she
s
old
enough
to
make
friends
for
oh
then
you
consider
her
simply
a
friend
i
shall
see
how
things
go
but
pray
do
you
consider
yourself
perfectly
free
asked
dora
with
some
indignation
why
shouldn
t
i
then
i
think
you
have
been
behaving
very
jasper
saw
that
she
was
in
earnest
he
stroked
the
back
of
his
head
and
smiled
at
the
wall
with
regard
to
marian
you
mean
of
course
i
but
marian
understands
me
perfectly
i
have
never
for
a
moment
tried
to
make
her
think
that
well
to
put
it
plainly
that
i
was
in
love
with
her
in
all
our
conversations
it
has
been
my
one
object
to
afford
her
insight
into
my
character
and
to
explain
my
position
she
has
no
excuse
whatever
for
misinterpreting
me
and
i
feel
assured
that
she
has
done
nothing
of
the
very
well
if
you
feel
satisfied
with
yourself
but
come
now
dora
what
s
all
this
about
you
are
marian
s
friend
and
of
course
i
don
t
wish
you
to
say
a
word
about
her
but
let
me
explain
myself
i
have
occasionally
walked
part
of
the
way
home
with
marian
when
she
and
i
have
happened
to
go
from
here
at
the
same
time
now
there
was
nothing
whatever
in
our
talk
at
such
times
that
anyone
mightn
t
have
listened
to
we
are
both
intellectual
people
and
we
talk
in
an
intellectual
way
you
seem
to
have
rather
ideas
provincial
ideas
a
girl
like
marian
yule
claims
the
new
privileges
of
woman
she
would
resent
it
if
you
supposed
that
she
couldn
t
be
friendly
with
a
man
without
attributing
intentions
to
him
to
use
the
old
word
we
don
t
live
in
wattleborough
where
liberty
is
rendered
impossible
by
the
cackling
of
no
but
well
it
seems
to
me
rather
strange
that
s
all
we
had
better
not
talk
about
it
any
but
i
have
only
just
begun
to
talk
about
it
i
must
try
to
make
my
position
intelligible
to
you
now
suppose
a
quite
impossible
thing
that
marian
inherited
some
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
pounds
i
should
forthwith
ask
her
to
be
my
oh
indeed
i
see
no
reason
for
sarcasm
it
would
be
a
most
rational
proceeding
i
like
her
very
much
but
to
marry
her
supposing
she
would
have
me
without
money
would
he
a
gross
absurdity
simply
spoiling
my
career
and
leading
to
all
sorts
of
no
one
would
suggest
that
you
should
marry
as
things
no
but
please
to
bear
in
mind
that
to
obtain
money
somehow
or
other
and
i
see
no
other
way
than
by
marriage
is
necessary
to
me
and
that
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
i
am
not
at
all
likely
to
get
a
big
editorship
for
some
years
to
come
and
i
don
t
feel
disposed
to
make
myself
prematurely
old
by
toiling
for
a
few
hundreds
per
annum
in
the
meantime
now
all
this
i
have
frankly
and
fully
explained
to
marian
i
dare
say
she
suspects
what
i
should
do
if
she
came
into
possession
of
money
there
s
no
harm
in
that
but
she
knows
perfectly
well
that
as
things
are
we
remain
intellectual
then
listen
to
me
jasper
if
we
hear
that
marian
gets
nothing
from
her
uncle
you
had
better
behave
honestly
and
let
her
see
that
you
haven
t
as
much
interest
in
her
as
that
would
be
it
would
be
well
no
it
wouldn
t
strictly
speaking
my
interest
in
marian
wouldn
t
suffer
at
all
i
should
know
that
we
could
be
nothing
but
friends
that
s
all
hitherto
i
haven
t
known
what
might
come
to
pass
i
don
t
know
yet
so
far
from
following
your
advice
i
shall
let
marian
understand
that
if
anything
i
am
more
her
friend
than
ever
seeing
that
henceforth
there
can
be
no
i
can
only
tell
you
that
maud
would
agree
with
me
in
what
i
have
been
then
both
of
you
have
distorted
i
think
not
it
s
you
who
are
my
dear
girl
haven
t
i
been
showing
you
that
no
man
could
be
more
more
straightforward
you
have
been
talking
nonsense
nonsense
oh
this
female
lack
of
logic
then
my
argument
has
been
utterly
thrown
away
now
that
s
one
of
the
things
i
like
in
miss
rupert
she
can
follow
an
argument
and
see
consequences
and
for
that
matter
so
can
marian
i
only
wish
it
were
possible
to
refer
this
question
to
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
dora
called
come
in
and
marian
herself
appeared
what
an
odd
thing
exclaimed
jasper
lowering
his
voice
i
was
that
moment
saying
i
wished
it
were
possible
to
refer
a
question
to
dora
reddened
and
stood
in
an
embarrassed
attitude
it
was
the
old
dispute
whether
women
in
general
are
capable
of
logic
but
pardon
me
miss
yule
i
forget
that
you
have
been
occupied
with
sad
things
since
i
last
saw
dora
led
her
to
a
chair
asking
if
her
father
had
returned
yes
he
came
back
jasper
and
his
sister
could
not
think
it
likely
that
marian
had
suffered
much
from
grief
at
her
uncle
s
death
practically
john
yule
was
a
stranger
to
her
yet
her
face
bore
the
signs
of
acute
mental
trouble
and
it
seemed
as
if
some
agitation
made
it
difficult
for
her
to
speak
the
awkward
silence
that
fell
upon
the
three
was
broken
by
jasper
who
expressed
a
regret
that
he
was
obliged
to
take
his
leave
maud
is
becoming
a
young
lady
of
society
he
said
just
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
as
he
moved
towards
the
door
if
she
comes
back
whilst
you
are
here
miss
yule
warn
her
that
that
is
the
path
of
destruction
for
literary
you
should
bear
that
in
mind
yourself
remarked
dora
with
a
significant
look
oh
i
am
enough
to
make
society
serve
my
own
marian
turned
her
head
with
a
sudden
movement
which
was
checked
before
she
had
quite
looked
round
to
him
the
phrase
he
uttered
last
appeared
to
have
affected
her
in
some
way
her
eyes
fell
and
an
expression
of
pain
was
on
her
brows
for
a
moment
i
can
only
stay
a
few
minutes
she
said
bending
with
a
faint
smile
towards
dora
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
i
have
come
on
my
way
from
the
where
you
have
tired
yourself
to
death
as
usual
i
can
no
i
have
done
scarcely
anything
i
only
pretended
to
read
my
mind
is
too
much
troubled
have
you
heard
anything
about
my
uncle
s
will
nothing
i
thought
it
might
have
been
spoken
of
in
wattleborough
and
some
friend
might
have
written
to
you
but
i
suppose
there
has
hardly
been
time
for
that
i
shall
surprise
you
very
much
father
receives
nothing
but
i
have
a
legacy
of
five
thousand
dora
kept
her
eyes
down
then
what
do
you
think
continued
marian
my
cousin
amy
has
ten
thousand
good
gracious
what
a
difference
that
will
make
yes
indeed
and
her
brother
john
has
six
thousand
but
nothing
to
their
mother
there
are
a
good
many
other
legacies
but
most
of
the
property
goes
to
the
wattleborough
park
yule
park
it
will
be
called
and
to
the
volunteers
and
things
of
that
kind
they
say
he
wasn
t
as
rich
as
people
do
you
know
what
miss
harrow
gets
she
has
the
house
for
her
life
and
fifteen
hundred
and
your
father
nothing
whatever
nothing
not
a
penny
oh
i
am
so
grieved
i
think
it
so
unkind
so
wrong
amy
and
her
brother
to
have
sixteen
thousand
pounds
and
father
nothing
i
can
t
understand
it
there
was
no
unkind
feeling
between
him
and
father
he
knew
what
a
hard
life
father
has
had
doesn
t
it
seem
heartless
what
does
your
father
say
i
think
he
feels
the
unkindness
more
than
he
does
the
disappointment
of
course
he
must
have
expected
something
he
came
into
the
room
where
mother
and
i
were
and
sat
down
and
began
to
tell
us
about
the
will
just
as
if
he
were
speaking
to
strangers
about
something
he
had
read
in
the
newspaper
that
s
the
only
way
i
can
describe
it
then
he
got
up
and
went
away
into
the
study
i
waited
a
little
and
then
went
to
him
there
he
was
sitting
at
work
as
if
he
hadn
t
been
away
from
home
at
all
i
tried
to
tell
him
how
sorry
i
was
but
i
couldn
t
say
anything
i
began
to
cry
foolishly
he
spoke
kindly
to
me
far
more
kindly
than
he
has
done
for
a
long
time
but
he
wouldn
t
talk
about
the
will
and
i
had
to
go
away
and
leave
him
poor
mother
for
all
she
was
afraid
that
we
were
going
to
be
rich
is
at
his
your
mother
was
afraid
said
dora
because
she
thought
herself
unfitted
for
life
in
a
large
house
and
feared
we
should
think
her
in
our
she
smiled
sadly
poor
mother
she
is
so
humble
and
so
good
i
do
hope
that
father
will
be
kinder
to
her
but
there
s
no
telling
yet
what
the
result
of
this
may
be
i
feel
guilty
when
i
stand
before
but
he
must
feel
glad
that
you
have
five
thousand
marian
delayed
her
reply
for
a
moment
her
eyes
down
yes
perhaps
he
is
glad
of
perhaps
he
can
t
help
thinking
dora
what
use
he
could
have
made
of
it
it
has
always
been
his
greatest
wish
to
have
a
literary
paper
of
his
own
like
the
study
you
know
he
would
have
used
the
money
in
that
way
i
am
but
all
the
same
he
ought
to
feel
pleasure
in
your
good
marian
turned
to
another
subject
think
of
the
reardons
what
a
change
all
at
once
what
will
they
do
i
wonder
surely
they
won
t
continue
to
live
apart
we
shall
hear
from
whilst
they
were
discussing
the
affairs
of
that
branch
of
the
family
maud
returned
there
was
on
her
handsome
face
and
she
greeted
marian
but
coldly
throwing
off
her
hat
and
gloves
and
mantle
she
listened
to
the
repeated
story
of
john
yule
s
bequests
but
why
ever
has
mrs
reardon
so
much
more
than
anyone
else
she
asked
we
can
only
suppose
it
is
because
she
was
the
favourite
child
of
the
brother
he
liked
best
yet
at
her
wedding
he
gave
her
nothing
and
spoke
contemptuously
of
her
for
marrying
a
literary
fortunate
for
her
poor
husband
that
her
uncle
was
able
to
forgive
her
i
wonder
what
s
the
date
of
the
will
who
knows
but
he
may
have
rewarded
her
for
quarrelling
with
mr
this
excited
a
laugh
i
don
t
know
when
the
will
was
made
said
marian
and
i
don
t
know
whether
uncle
had
even
heard
of
the
reardons
misfortunes
i
suppose
he
must
have
done
my
cousin
john
was
at
the
funeral
but
not
my
aunt
i
think
it
most
likely
father
and
john
didn
t
speak
a
word
to
each
other
fortunately
the
relatives
were
lost
sight
of
in
the
great
crowd
of
wattleborough
people
there
was
an
enormous
procession
of
maud
kept
glancing
at
her
sister
the
had
not
altogether
passed
from
her
face
but
it
was
now
blended
with
reflectiveness
a
few
moments
more
and
marian
had
to
hasten
home
when
she
was
gone
the
sisters
looked
at
each
other
five
thousand
pounds
murmured
the
elder
i
suppose
that
is
considered
i
suppose
he
was
here
when
marian
came
but
didn
t
then
you
ll
take
him
the
news
this
evening
yes
replied
dora
then
after
musing
he
seemed
annoyed
that
you
were
at
the
lanes
maud
made
a
movement
of
indifference
what
has
been
putting
you
out
things
were
rather
stupid
some
people
who
were
to
have
come
didn
t
turn
up
and
well
it
doesn
t
she
rose
and
glanced
at
herself
in
the
little
oblong
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
did
jasper
ever
speak
to
you
of
a
miss
rupert
asked
dora
not
that
i
what
do
you
think
he
told
me
in
the
calmest
way
that
he
didn
t
see
why
marian
should
think
of
him
as
anything
but
the
most
ordinary
friend
said
he
had
never
given
her
reason
to
think
anything
indeed
and
miss
rupert
is
someone
who
has
the
honour
of
his
preference
he
says
she
is
about
thirty
and
rather
masculine
but
a
great
heiress
jasper
is
shameful
what
do
you
expect
i
consider
it
is
your
duty
to
let
marian
know
everything
he
says
otherwise
you
help
to
deceive
her
he
has
no
sense
of
honour
in
such
dora
was
so
impatient
to
let
her
brother
have
the
news
that
she
left
the
house
as
soon
as
she
had
had
tea
on
the
chance
of
finding
jasper
at
home
she
had
not
gone
a
dozen
yards
before
she
encountered
him
in
person
i
was
afraid
marian
might
still
be
with
you
he
said
laughing
i
should
have
asked
the
landlady
well
we
can
t
stand
talking
here
you
had
better
come
he
was
in
too
much
excitement
to
wait
just
tell
me
what
has
she
dora
walked
quickly
towards
the
house
looking
annoyed
nothing
at
all
then
what
has
her
father
he
has
nothing
replied
his
sister
and
she
has
five
thousand
jasper
walked
on
with
bent
head
he
said
nothing
more
until
he
was
upstairs
in
the
where
maud
greeted
him
carelessly
mrs
reardon
anything
dora
informed
him
what
he
cried
incredulously
ten
thousand
you
don
t
say
so
he
burst
into
uproarious
laughter
so
reardon
is
rescued
from
the
slum
and
the
clerk
s
desk
well
i
m
glad
by
jove
i
am
i
should
have
liked
it
better
if
marian
had
had
the
ten
thousand
and
he
the
five
but
it
s
an
excellent
joke
perhaps
the
next
thing
will
be
that
he
ll
refuse
to
have
anything
to
do
with
his
wife
s
money
that
would
be
just
like
after
amusing
himself
with
this
subject
for
a
few
minutes
more
he
turned
to
the
window
and
stood
there
in
silence
are
you
going
to
have
tea
with
us
dora
inquired
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
her
on
a
repetition
of
the
inquiry
he
answered
absently
yes
i
may
as
well
then
i
can
go
home
and
get
to
during
the
remainder
of
his
stay
he
talked
very
little
and
as
maud
also
was
in
an
abstracted
mood
tea
passed
almost
in
silence
on
the
point
of
departing
he
asked
when
is
marian
likely
to
come
here
again
i
haven
t
the
least
idea
answered
dora
he
nodded
and
went
his
way
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
work
at
a
magazine
article
which
he
had
begun
this
morning
and
on
reaching
home
he
spread
out
his
papers
in
the
usual
businesslike
fashion
the
subject
out
of
which
he
was
manufacturing
copy
had
its
difficulties
and
was
not
altogether
congenial
to
him
this
morning
he
had
laboured
with
unwonted
effort
to
produce
about
a
page
of
manuscript
and
now
that
he
tried
to
resume
the
task
his
thoughts
would
not
centre
upon
it
jasper
was
too
young
to
have
thoroughly
mastered
the
art
of
somnambulistic
composition
to
write
he
was
still
obliged
to
give
exclusive
attention
to
the
matter
under
treatment
dr
johnson
s
saying
that
a
man
may
write
at
any
time
if
he
will
set
himself
doggedly
to
it
was
often
upon
his
lips
and
had
even
been
of
help
to
him
as
no
doubt
it
has
to
many
another
man
obliged
to
compose
amid
distracting
circumstances
but
the
formula
had
no
efficacy
this
evening
twice
or
thrice
he
rose
from
his
chair
paced
the
room
with
a
determined
brow
and
sat
down
again
with
vigorous
clutch
of
the
pen
still
he
failed
to
excogitate
a
single
sentence
that
would
serve
his
purpose
i
must
have
it
out
with
myself
before
i
can
do
anything
was
his
thought
as
he
finally
abandoned
the
endeavour
i
must
make
up
my
to
this
end
he
settled
himself
in
an
and
began
to
smoke
cigarettes
some
dozen
of
these
aids
to
reflection
only
made
him
so
nervous
that
he
could
no
longer
remain
alone
he
put
on
his
hat
and
overcoat
and
went
out
to
find
that
it
was
raining
heavily
he
returned
for
an
umbrella
and
before
long
was
walking
aimlessly
about
the
strand
unable
to
make
up
his
mind
whether
to
turn
into
a
theatre
or
not
instead
of
doing
so
he
sought
a
certain
upper
room
of
a
familiar
restaurant
where
the
day
s
papers
were
to
be
seen
and
perchance
an
acquaintance
might
be
met
only
men
were
there
reading
and
smoking
and
all
were
unknown
to
him
he
drank
a
glass
of
lager
beer
skimmed
the
news
of
the
evening
and
again
went
out
into
the
bad
weather
after
all
it
was
better
to
go
home
everything
he
encountered
had
an
unsettling
effect
upon
him
so
that
he
was
further
than
ever
from
the
decision
at
which
he
wished
to
arrive
in
mornington
road
he
came
upon
whelpdale
who
was
walking
slowly
under
an
umbrella
i
ve
just
called
at
your
all
right
come
back
if
you
but
perhaps
i
shall
waste
your
time
said
whelpdale
with
unusual
diffidence
reassured
he
gladly
returned
to
the
house
milvain
acquainted
him
with
the
fact
of
john
yule
s
death
and
with
its
result
so
far
as
it
concerned
the
reardons
they
talked
of
how
the
couple
would
probably
behave
under
this
decisive
change
of
circumstances
biffen
professes
to
know
nothing
about
mrs
reardon
said
whelpdale
i
suspect
he
keeps
his
knowledge
to
himself
out
of
regard
for
reardon
it
wouldn
t
surprise
me
if
they
live
apart
for
a
long
time
not
very
likely
it
was
only
want
of
they
re
not
at
all
suited
to
each
other
mrs
reardon
no
doubt
repents
her
marriage
bitterly
and
i
doubt
whether
reardon
cares
much
for
his
as
there
s
no
way
of
getting
divorced
they
ll
make
the
best
of
it
ten
thousand
pounds
produce
about
four
hundred
a
year
it
s
enough
to
live
and
be
miserable
on
if
they
no
longer
love
each
you
re
such
a
sentimental
fellow
cried
jasper
i
believe
you
seriously
think
that
love
the
sort
of
frenzy
you
understand
by
it
ought
to
endure
throughout
married
life
how
has
a
man
come
to
your
age
with
such
primitive
ideas
well
i
don
t
know
perhaps
you
err
a
little
in
the
opposite
i
haven
t
much
faith
in
marrying
for
love
as
you
know
what
s
more
i
believe
it
s
the
very
rarest
thing
for
people
to
be
in
love
with
each
other
reardon
and
his
wife
perhaps
were
an
instance
perhaps
i
m
not
quite
sure
about
her
as
a
rule
marriage
is
the
result
of
a
mild
preference
encouraged
by
circumstances
and
deliberately
heightened
into
strong
sexual
feeling
you
of
all
men
know
well
enough
that
the
same
kind
of
feeling
could
be
produced
for
almost
any
woman
who
wasn
t
the
same
kind
of
feeling
but
there
s
vast
difference
of
to
be
sure
i
think
it
s
only
a
matter
of
degree
when
it
rises
to
the
point
of
frenzy
people
may
strictly
be
said
to
be
in
love
and
as
i
tell
you
i
think
that
comes
to
pass
very
rarely
indeed
for
my
own
part
i
have
no
experience
of
it
and
think
i
never
shall
i
can
t
say
the
they
laughed
i
dare
say
you
have
imagined
yourself
in
love
or
really
been
so
for
aught
i
know
a
dozen
times
how
the
deuce
you
can
attach
any
importance
to
such
feeling
where
marriage
is
concerned
i
don
t
well
now
said
whelpdale
i
have
never
upheld
the
theory
at
least
not
since
i
was
sixteen
that
a
man
can
be
in
love
only
once
or
that
there
is
one
particular
woman
if
he
misses
whom
he
can
never
be
happy
there
may
be
thousands
of
women
whom
i
could
love
with
equal
i
object
to
the
word
love
altogether
it
has
been
vulgarised
let
us
talk
about
compatibility
now
i
should
say
that
no
doubt
and
speaking
scientifically
there
is
one
particular
woman
supremely
fitted
to
each
man
i
put
aside
consideration
of
circumstances
we
know
that
circumstances
will
disturb
any
degree
of
abstract
fitness
but
in
the
nature
of
things
there
must
be
one
woman
whose
nature
is
specially
well
adapted
to
harmonise
with
mine
or
with
yours
if
there
were
any
means
of
discovering
this
woman
in
each
case
then
i
have
no
doubt
it
would
be
worth
a
man
s
utmost
effort
to
do
so
and
any
amount
of
erotic
jubilation
would
be
reasonable
when
the
discovery
was
made
but
the
thing
is
impossible
and
what
s
more
we
know
what
ridiculous
fallibility
people
display
when
they
imagine
they
have
found
the
best
substitute
for
that
indiscoverable
this
is
what
makes
me
impatient
with
sentimental
talk
about
marriage
an
educated
man
mustn
t
play
so
into
the
hands
of
ironic
destiny
let
him
think
he
wants
to
marry
a
woman
but
don
t
let
him
exaggerate
his
feelings
or
idealise
their
there
s
a
good
deal
in
all
that
admitted
whelpdale
though
discontentedly
there
s
more
than
a
good
deal
there
s
the
last
word
on
the
subject
the
days
of
romantic
love
are
gone
by
the
scientific
spirit
has
put
an
end
to
that
kind
of
romantic
love
was
inextricably
blended
with
all
sorts
of
superstitions
belief
in
personal
immortality
in
superior
beings
in
all
the
rest
of
it
what
we
think
of
now
is
moral
and
intellectual
and
physical
compatibility
i
mean
if
we
are
reasonable
and
if
we
are
not
so
unfortunate
as
to
fall
in
love
with
an
incompatible
added
whelpdale
laughing
well
that
is
a
form
of
unreason
a
blind
desire
which
science
could
explain
in
each
case
i
rejoice
that
i
am
not
subject
to
that
form
of
you
positively
never
were
in
love
as
you
understand
it
never
but
i
have
felt
a
very
distinct
based
on
what
you
think
compatibility
yes
not
strong
enough
to
make
me
lose
sight
of
prudence
and
advantage
no
not
strong
enough
for
he
seemed
to
be
reassuring
himself
then
of
course
that
can
t
be
called
love
said
whelpdale
perhaps
not
but
as
i
told
you
a
preference
of
this
kind
can
be
heightened
into
emotion
if
one
chooses
in
the
case
of
which
i
am
thinking
it
easily
might
be
and
i
think
it
very
improbable
indeed
that
i
should
repent
it
if
anything
led
me
to
indulge
such
an
whelpdale
smiled
this
is
very
interesting
i
hope
it
may
lead
to
i
don
t
think
it
will
i
am
far
more
likely
to
marry
some
woman
for
whom
i
have
no
preference
but
who
can
serve
me
i
confess
that
amazes
me
i
know
the
value
of
money
as
well
as
you
do
but
i
wouldn
t
marry
a
rich
woman
for
whom
i
had
no
preference
by
jove
no
yes
yes
you
are
a
consistent
doomed
to
perpetual
disappointment
said
the
other
looking
disconsolately
about
the
room
courage
my
boy
i
have
every
hope
that
i
shall
see
you
marry
and
i
admit
the
danger
of
that
but
shall
i
tell
you
something
i
have
observed
each
woman
i
fall
in
love
with
is
of
a
higher
type
than
the
one
jasper
roared
irreverently
and
his
companion
looked
hurt
but
i
am
perfectly
serious
i
assure
you
to
go
back
only
three
or
four
years
there
was
the
daughter
of
my
landlady
in
barham
street
well
a
nice
girl
enough
but
limited
decidedly
limited
next
came
that
girl
at
the
stationer
s
you
remember
she
was
distinctly
an
advance
both
in
mind
and
person
then
there
was
miss
embleton
yes
i
think
she
made
again
an
advance
she
had
been
at
bedford
college
you
know
and
was
really
a
girl
of
considerable
attainments
morally
admirable
afterwards
he
paused
the
maiden
from
birmingham
wasn
t
it
said
jasper
again
exploding
yes
it
was
well
i
can
t
be
quite
sure
but
in
many
respects
that
girl
was
my
ideal
she
really
as
you
once
or
twice
told
me
at
the
i
really
believe
she
would
rank
above
miss
embleton
at
all
events
from
my
point
of
view
and
that
s
everything
you
know
it
s
the
effect
a
woman
produces
on
one
that
has
to
be
the
next
should
be
a
paragon
said
jasper
the
next
whelpdale
again
looked
about
the
room
but
added
nothing
and
fell
into
a
long
silence
when
left
to
himself
jasper
walked
about
a
little
then
sat
down
at
his
for
he
felt
easier
in
mind
and
fancied
that
he
might
still
do
a
couple
of
hours
work
before
going
to
bed
he
did
in
fact
write
lines
but
with
the
effort
came
back
his
former
mood
very
soon
the
pen
dropped
and
he
was
once
more
in
the
throes
of
anxious
mental
debate
he
sat
till
after
midnight
and
when
he
went
to
his
bedroom
it
was
with
a
lingering
step
which
proved
him
still
a
prey
to
indecision
part
four
chapter
xxiii
a
proposed
investment
alfred
yule
s
behaviour
under
his
disappointment
seemed
to
prove
that
even
for
him
the
uses
of
adversity
could
be
sweet
on
the
day
after
his
return
home
he
displayed
a
most
unwonted
mildness
in
such
remarks
as
he
addressed
to
his
wife
and
his
bearing
towards
marian
was
gravely
gentle
at
meals
he
conversed
or
rather
monologised
on
literary
topics
with
occasionally
one
of
his
grim
jokes
pointed
for
marian
s
appreciation
he
became
aware
that
the
girl
had
been
overtaxing
her
strength
of
late
and
suggested
a
few
weeks
of
recreation
among
new
novels
the
coldness
and
gloom
which
had
possessed
him
when
he
made
a
formal
announcement
of
the
news
appeared
to
have
given
way
before
the
sympathy
manifested
by
his
wife
and
daughter
he
was
now
sorrowful
but
resigned
he
explained
to
marian
the
exact
nature
of
her
legacy
it
was
to
be
paid
out
of
her
uncle
s
share
in
a
wholesale
stationery
business
with
which
john
yule
had
been
connected
for
the
last
twenty
years
but
from
which
he
had
not
long
ago
withdrawn
a
large
portion
of
his
invested
capital
this
house
was
known
as
turberville
a
name
which
marian
now
heard
for
the
first
time
i
knew
nothing
of
his
association
with
them
said
her
father
they
tell
me
that
seven
or
eight
thousand
pounds
will
be
realised
from
that
source
it
seems
a
pity
that
the
investment
was
not
left
to
you
intact
whether
there
will
be
any
delay
in
withdrawing
the
money
i
can
t
the
executors
were
two
old
friends
of
the
deceased
one
of
them
a
former
partner
in
his
concern
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
about
an
hour
after
dinner
was
over
mr
hinks
called
at
the
house
as
usual
he
went
into
the
study
before
long
came
a
second
visitor
mr
quarmby
who
joined
yule
and
hinks
the
three
had
all
sat
together
for
some
time
when
marian
who
happened
to
be
coming
down
stairs
saw
her
father
at
the
study
door
ask
your
mother
to
let
us
have
some
supper
at
a
quarter
to
ten
he
said
urbanely
and
come
in
won
t
you
we
are
only
it
had
not
often
happened
that
marian
was
invited
to
join
parties
of
this
kind
do
you
wish
me
to
come
she
asked
yes
i
should
like
you
to
if
you
have
nothing
particular
to
marian
informed
mrs
yule
that
the
visitors
would
have
supper
and
then
went
to
the
study
mr
quarmby
was
smoking
a
pipe
mr
hinks
who
on
grounds
of
economy
had
long
since
given
up
tobacco
sat
with
his
hands
in
his
trouser
pockets
and
his
long
thin
legs
tucked
beneath
the
chair
both
rose
and
greeted
marian
with
more
than
ordinary
warmth
will
you
allow
me
five
or
six
more
puffs
asked
mr
quarmby
laying
one
hand
on
his
ample
stomach
and
elevating
his
pipe
as
if
it
were
a
glass
of
beaded
liquor
i
shall
then
have
as
many
more
as
you
like
marian
replied
the
easiest
chair
was
placed
for
her
mr
hinks
hastening
to
perform
this
courtesy
and
her
father
apprised
her
of
the
topic
they
were
discussing
what
s
your
view
marian
is
there
anything
to
be
said
for
the
establishment
of
a
literary
academy
in
england
mr
quarmby
beamed
benevolently
upon
her
and
mr
hinks
his
scraggy
neck
at
full
length
awaited
her
reply
with
a
look
of
the
most
respectful
attention
i
really
think
we
have
quite
enough
literary
quarrelling
as
it
is
the
girl
replied
casting
down
her
eyes
and
smiling
mr
quarmby
uttered
a
hollow
chuckle
mr
hinks
laughed
thinly
and
exclaimed
very
good
indeed
very
good
yule
affected
to
applaud
with
impartial
smile
it
wouldn
t
harmonise
with
the
spirit
remarked
mr
hinks
with
an
air
of
diffident
profundity
yule
held
forth
on
the
subject
for
a
few
minutes
in
laboured
phrases
presently
the
conversation
turned
to
periodicals
and
the
three
men
were
unanimous
in
an
opinion
that
no
existing
monthly
or
quarterly
could
be
considered
as
representing
the
best
literary
opinion
we
want
remarked
mr
quarmby
we
want
a
monthly
review
which
shall
deal
exclusively
with
literature
the
fortnightly
the
contemporary
they
are
very
well
in
their
way
but
then
they
are
mere
miscellanies
you
will
find
one
solid
literary
article
amid
a
confused
mass
of
politics
and
economics
and
general
articles
on
the
currency
and
railway
statistics
and
views
of
evolution
said
mr
hinks
with
a
look
as
if
something
were
grating
between
his
teeth
the
quarterlies
put
in
yule
well
the
original
idea
of
the
quarterlies
was
that
there
are
not
enough
important
books
published
to
occupy
solid
reviewers
more
than
four
times
a
year
that
may
be
true
but
then
a
literary
monthly
would
include
much
more
than
professed
reviews
hinks
s
essays
on
the
historical
drama
would
have
come
out
in
it
very
well
or
your
spanish
poets
i
threw
out
the
idea
to
jedwood
the
other
day
said
mr
quarmby
and
he
seemed
to
nibble
at
yes
yes
came
from
yule
but
jedwood
has
so
many
irons
in
the
fire
i
doubt
if
he
has
the
necessary
capital
at
command
just
now
no
doubt
he
s
the
man
if
some
capitalist
would
join
no
enormous
capital
needed
opined
mr
quarmby
the
thing
would
pay
its
way
almost
from
the
first
it
would
take
a
place
between
the
literary
weeklies
and
the
quarterlies
the
former
are
too
academic
the
latter
too
massive
for
multitudes
of
people
who
yet
have
strong
literary
tastes
foreign
publications
should
be
liberally
dealt
with
but
as
hinks
says
no
meddling
with
the
books
that
are
no
books
biblia
abiblia
nothing
about
essays
on
bimetallism
and
treatises
for
or
against
even
here
in
the
freedom
of
a
friend
s
study
he
laughed
his
laugh
folding
both
hands
upon
his
expansive
waistcoat
fiction
i
presume
a
serial
of
the
better
kind
might
be
admitted
said
yule
that
would
be
advisable
no
doubt
but
strictly
of
the
better
oh
strictly
of
the
better
kind
chimed
in
mr
hinks
they
pursued
the
discussion
as
if
they
were
an
editorial
committee
planning
a
review
of
which
the
first
number
was
shortly
to
appear
it
occupied
them
until
mrs
yule
announced
at
the
door
that
supper
was
ready
during
the
meal
marian
found
herself
the
object
of
unusual
attention
her
father
troubled
to
inquire
if
the
cut
of
cold
beef
he
sent
her
was
to
her
taste
and
kept
an
eye
on
her
progress
mr
hinks
talked
to
her
in
a
tone
of
respectful
sympathy
and
mr
quarmby
was
paternally
jovial
when
he
addressed
her
mrs
yule
would
have
kept
silence
in
her
ordinary
way
but
this
evening
her
husband
made
several
remarks
which
he
had
adapted
to
her
intellect
and
even
showed
that
a
reply
would
be
graciously
received
mother
and
daughter
remained
together
when
the
men
withdrew
to
their
tobacco
and
toddy
neither
made
allusion
to
the
wonderful
change
but
they
talked
more
than
for
a
long
time
on
the
morrow
yule
began
by
consulting
marian
with
regard
to
the
disposition
of
matter
in
an
essay
he
was
writing
what
she
said
he
weighed
carefully
and
seemed
to
think
that
she
had
set
his
doubts
at
rest
poor
old
hinks
he
said
presently
with
a
sigh
breaking
up
isn
t
he
he
positively
totters
in
his
walk
i
m
afraid
he
s
the
kind
of
man
to
have
a
paralytic
stroke
it
wouldn
t
astonish
me
to
hear
at
any
moment
that
he
was
lying
what
ever
would
become
of
him
in
that
case
goodness
knows
one
might
ask
the
same
of
so
many
of
us
what
would
become
of
me
for
instance
if
i
were
incapable
of
work
marian
could
make
no
reply
there
s
something
i
ll
just
mention
to
you
he
went
on
in
a
lowered
tone
though
i
don
t
wish
you
to
take
it
too
seriously
i
m
beginning
to
have
a
little
trouble
with
my
she
looked
at
him
startled
with
your
eyes
nothing
i
hope
but
well
i
think
i
shall
see
an
oculist
one
doesn
t
care
to
face
a
prospect
of
failing
sight
perhaps
of
cataract
or
something
of
that
kind
still
it
s
better
to
know
the
facts
i
should
by
all
means
go
to
an
oculist
said
marian
earnestly
don
t
disturb
yourself
about
it
it
may
be
nothing
at
all
but
in
any
case
i
must
change
my
he
rustled
over
some
slips
of
manuscript
whilst
marian
regarded
him
anxiously
now
i
appeal
to
you
marian
he
continued
could
i
possibly
save
money
out
of
an
income
that
has
never
exceeded
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
and
often
i
mean
even
in
latter
years
has
been
much
less
i
don
t
see
how
you
in
one
way
of
course
i
have
managed
it
my
life
is
insured
for
five
hundred
pounds
but
that
is
no
provision
for
possible
disablement
if
i
could
no
longer
earn
money
with
my
pen
what
would
become
of
me
marian
could
have
made
an
encouraging
reply
but
did
not
venture
to
utter
her
thoughts
sit
down
said
her
father
you
are
not
to
work
for
a
few
days
and
i
myself
shall
be
none
the
worse
for
a
morning

rest
poor
old

i
suppose
we
shall
help
him
among
us
somehow
quarmby
of
course
is
comparatively
flourishing
well
we
have
been
companions
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
we
three
when
i
first
met
quarmby
i
was
a
grub
street
gazetteer
and
i
think
he
was
even
poorer
than
i
a
life
of
toil
a
life
of
toil
that
it
has
been
he
threw
an
arm
over
the
back
of
his
chair
what
did
you
think
of
our
imaginary
review
the
thing
we
were
talking
about
last
night
there
are
so
many
periodicals
replied
marian
doubtfully
so
many
my
dear
child
if
we
live
another
ten
years
we
shall
see
the
number
is
it
desirable
that
there
should
be
such
growth
of
periodicals
well
from
one
point
of
view
no
no
doubt
they
take
up
the
time
which
some
people
would
give
to
solid
literature
but
on
the
other
hand
there
s
a
far
greater
number
of
people
who
would
probably
not
read
at
all
but
for
the
temptations
of
these
short
and
new
articles
and
they
may
be
induced
to
pass
on
to
substantial
works
of
course
it
all
depends
on
the
quality
of
the
periodical
matter
you
offer
now
magazines
like
he
named
two
or
three
of
popular
stamp
might
very
well
be
dispensed
with
unless
one
regards
them
as
an
alternative
to
the
talking
of
scandal
or
any
other
vicious
result
of
total
idleness
but
such
a
monthly
as
we
projected
would
be
of
distinct
literary
value
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
someone
or
other
will
shortly
establish
i
am
afraid
said
marian
i
haven
t
so
much
sympathy
with
literary
undertakings
as
you
would
like
me
to
money
is
a
great
fortifier
of
since
she
had
become
really
conscious
of
her
position
as
the
owner
of
five
thousand
pounds
marian
spoke
with
a
steadier
voice
walked
with
firmer
step
mentally
she
felt
herself
altogether
a
less
dependent
being
she
might
have
confessed
this
lukewarmness
towards
literary
enterprise
in
the
anger
which
her
father
excited
eight
or
nine
days
ago
but
at
that
time
she
could
not
have
uttered
her
opinion
calmly
deliberately
as
now
the
smile
which
accompanied
the
words
was
also
new
it
signified
deliverance
from
pupilage
i
have
felt
that
returned
her
father
after
a
slight
pause
to
command
his
voice
that
it
might
be
suave
instead
of
scornful
i
greatly
fear
that
i
have
made
your
life
something
of
a
martyrdom
don
t
think
i
meant
that
father
i
am
speaking
only
of
the
general
question
i
can
t
be
quite
so
zealous
as
you
are
that
s
all
i
love
books
but
i
could
wish
people
were
content
for
a
while
with
those
we
already
my
dear
marian
don
t
suppose
that
i
am
out
of
sympathy
with
you
here
alas
how
much
of
my
work
has
been
mere
drudgery
mere
labouring
for
a
livelihood
how
gladly
i
would
have
spent
much
more
of
my
time
among
the
great
authors
with
no
thought
of
making
money
of
them
if
i
speak
approvingly
of
a
scheme
for
a
new
periodical
it
is
greatly
because
of
my
he
paused
and
looked
at
her
marian
returned
the
look
you
would
of
course
write
for
it
she
said
marian
why
shouldn
t
i
edit
it
why
shouldn
t
it
be
your
property
my
property
she
checked
a
laugh
there
came
into
her
mind
a
more
disagreeable
suspicion
than
she
had
ever
entertained
of
her
father
was
this
the
meaning
of
his
softened
behaviour
was
he
capable
of
calculated
hypocrisy
that
did
not
seem
consistent
with
his
character
as
she
knew
it
let
us
talk
it
over
said
yule
he
was
in
visible
agitation
and
his
voice
shook
the
idea
may
well
startle
you
at
first
it
will
seem
to
you
that
i
propose
to
make
away
with
your
property
before
you
have
even
come
into
possession
of
he
laughed
but
in
fact
what
i
have
in
mind
is
merely
an
investment
for
your
capital
and
that
an
admirable
one
five
thousand
pounds
at
three
per
one
doesn
t
care
to
reckon
on
more
represents
a
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
now
there
can
be
very
little
doubt
that
if
it
were
invested
in
literary
property
such
as
i
have
in
mind
it
would
bring
you
five
times
that
interest
and
before
long
perhaps
much
more
of
course
i
am
now
speaking
in
the
roughest
outline
i
should
have
to
get
trustworthy
advice
complete
and
detailed
estimates
would
be
submitted
to
you
at
present
i
merely
suggest
to
you
this
form
of
he
watched
her
face
eagerly
greedily
when
marian
s
eyes
rose
to
his
he
looked
away
then
of
course
she
said
you
don
t
expect
me
to
give
any
decided
of
course
not
of
course
not
i
merely
put
before
you
the
chief
advantages
of
such
an
investment
as
i
am
a
selfish
old
fellow
i
ll
talk
about
the
benefit
to
myself
first
of
all
i
should
be
editor
of
the
new
review
i
should
draw
a
stipend
sufficient
to
all
my
needs
quite
content
at
first
to
take
far
less
than
another
man
would
ask
and
to
progress
with
the
advance
of
the
periodical
this
position
would
enable
me
to
have
done
with
mere
drudgery
i
should
only
write
when
i
felt
called
to
do
so
when
the
spirit
moved
again
he
laughed
as
though
desirous
of
keeping
his
listener
in
good
humour
my
eyes
would
be
greatly
spared
he
dwelt
on
that
point
waiting
its
effect
on
marian
as
she
said
nothing
he
proceeded
and
suppose
i
really
were
doomed
to
lose
my
sight
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
the
proprietor
of
this
periodical
would
willingly
grant
a
small
annuity
to
the
man
who
had
firmly
established
it
i
see
the
force
of
all
that
said
marian
but
it
takes
for
granted
that
the
periodical
will
be
it
does
in
the
hands
of
a
publisher
like
jedwood
a
vigorous
man
of
the
new
school
its
success
could
scarcely
be
do
you
think
five
thousand
pounds
would
be
enough
to
start
such
a
review
well
i
can
say
nothing
definite
on
that
point
for
one
thing
the
coat
must
be
made
according
to
the
cloth
expenditure
can
be
largely
controlled
without
endangering
success
then
again
i
think
jedwood
would
take
a
share
in
the
venture
these
are
details
at
present
i
only
want
to
familiarise
you
with
the
thought
that
an
investment
of
this
sort
will
very
probably
offer
itself
to
it
would
be
better
if
we
called
it
a
speculation
said
marian
smiling
uneasily
her
one
object
at
present
was
to
oblige
her
father
to
understand
that
the
suggestion
by
no
means
lured
her
she
could
not
tell
him
that
what
he
proposed
was
out
of
the
question
though
as
yet
that
was
the
light
in
which
she
saw
it
his
subtlety
of
approach
had
made
her
feel
justified
in
dealing
with
him
in
a
way
he
must
see
that
she
was
not
to
be
cajoled
obviously
and
in
the
nature
of
the
case
he
was
urging
a
proposal
in
which
he
himself
had
all
faith
but
marian
knew
his
judgment
was
far
from
infallible
it
mitigated
her
sense
of
behaving
unkindly
to
reflect
that
in
all
likelihood
this
disposal
of
her
money
would
be
the
worst
possible
for
her
own
interests
and
therefore
for
his
if
indeed
his
dark
forebodings
were
warranted
then
upon
her
would
fall
the
care
of
him
and
the
steadiness
with
which
she
faced
that
responsibility
came
from
a
hope
of
which
she
could
not
speak
name
it
as
you
will
returned
her
father
hardly
suppressing
a
note
of
irritation
true
every
commercial
enterprise
is
a
speculation
but
let
me
ask
you
one
question
and
beg
you
to
reply
frankly
do
you
distrust
my
ability
to
conduct
this
periodical
she
did
she
knew
that
he
was
not
in
touch
with
the
interests
of
the
day
and
that
all
manner
of
considerations
akin
to
the
prime
end
of
selling
his
review
would
make
him
an
untrustworthy
editor
but
how
could
she
tell
him
this
my
opinion
would
be
worthless
she
replied
if
jedwood
were
disposed
to
put
confidence
in
me
you
also
would
there
s
no
need
to
talk
of
that
now
father
indeed
i
can
t
say
anything
that
would
sound
like
a
he
flashed
a
glance
at
her
then
she
was
more
than
doubtful
but
you
have
no
objection
marian
to
talk
in
a
friendly
way
of
a
project
that
would
mean
so
much
to
me
but
i
am
afraid
to
encourage
you
she
replied
frankly
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
whether
i
can
do
as
you
wish
or
yes
yes
i
perfectly
understand
that
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
regard
you
as
a
child
to
be
led
independently
of
your
own
views
and
wishes
with
so
large
a
sum
of
money
at
stake
it
would
be
monstrous
if
i
acted
rashly
and
tried
to
persuade
you
to
do
the
same
the
matter
will
have
to
be
most
gravely
she
spoke
mechanically
but
if
only
it
should
come
to
something
you
don
t
know
what
it
would
mean
to
me
yes
father
i
know
very
well
how
you
think
and
feel
about
do
you
he
leaned
forward
his
features
working
under
stress
of
emotion
if
i
could
see
myself
the
editor
of
an
influential
review
all
my
bygone
toils
and
sufferings
would
be
as
nothing
i
should
rejoice
in
them
as
the
steps
to
this
triumph
meminisse
juvabit
my
dear
i
am
not
a
man
fitted
for
subordinate
places
my
nature
is
framed
for
authority
the
failure
of
all
my
undertakings
rankles
so
in
my
heart
that
sometimes
i
feel
capable
of
every
brutality
every
meanness
every
hateful
cruelty
to
you
i
have
behaved
shamefully
don
t
interrupt
me
marian
i
have
treated
you
abominably
my
child
my
dear
daughter
and
all
the
time
with
a
full
sense
of
what
i
was
doing
that
s
the
punishment
of
faults
such
as
mine
i
hate
myself
for
every
harsh
word
and
angry
look
i
have
given
you
at
the
time
i
hated
myself
father
no
no
let
me
speak
marian
you
have
forgiven
me
i
know
it
you
were
always
ready
to
forgive
dear
can
i
ever
forget
that
evening
when
i
spoke
like
a
brute
and
you
came
afterwards
and
addressed
me
as
if
the
wrong
had
been
on
your
side
it
burns
in
my
memory
it
wasn
t
i
who
spoke
it
was
the
demon
of
failure
of
humiliation
my
enemies
sit
in
triumph
and
scorn
at
me
the
thought
of
it
is
infuriating
have
i
deserved
this
am
i
the
inferior
of
of
those
men
who
have
succeeded
and
now
try
to
trample
on
me
no
i
am
not
i
have
a
better
brain
and
a
better
heart
listening
to
this
strange
outpouring
marian
more
than
forgave
the
hypocrisy
of
the
last
day
or
two
nay
could
it
be
called
hypocrisy
it
was
only
his
better
self
declared
at
the
impulse
of
a
passionate
hope
why
should
you
think
so
much
of
these
troubles
father
is
it
such
a
great
matter
that
people
triumph
over
you
he
clutched
at
the
word
you
admit
they
are
that
i
feel
very
sure
that
mr
fadge
then
you
are
not
on
his
side
against
me
how
could
you
suppose
such
a
thing
well
well
we
won
t
talk
of
that
perhaps
it
isn
t
a
great
matter
no
from
a
philosophical
point
of
view
such
things
are
unspeakably
petty
but
i
am
not
much
of
a
he
laughed
with
a
break
in
his
voice
defeat
in
life
is
defeat
after
all
and
unmerited
failure
is
a
bitter
curse
you
see
i
am
not
too
old
to
do
something
yet
my
sight
is
failing
but
i
can
take
care
of
it
if
i
had
my
own
review
i
would
write
every
now
and
then
a
critical
paper
in
my
very
best
style
you
remember
poor
old
hinks
s
note
about
me
in
his
book
we
laughed
at
it
but
he
wasn
t
so
far
wrong
i
have
many
of
those
qualities
a
man
is
conscious
of
his
own
merits
as
well
as
of
his
defects
i
have
done
a
few
admirable
things
you
remember
my
paper
on
lord
herbert
of
cherbury
no
one
ever
wrote
a
more
subtle
piece
of
criticism
but
it
was
swept
aside
among
the
rubbish
of
the
magazines
and
it
s
just
because
of
my
pungent
phrases
that
i
have
excited
so
much
enmity
wait
wait
let
me
have
my
own
review
and
leisure
and
satisfaction
of
mind
heavens
what
i
will
write
how
i
will
scarify
that
is
unworthy
of
you
how
much
better
to
ignore
your
enemies
in
such
a
position
i
should
carefully
avoid
every
word
that
betrayed
personal
well
well
you
are
of
course
right
my
good
girl
and
i
believe
i
should
do
injustice
to
myself
if
i
made
you
think
that
those
ignoble
motives
are
the
strongest
in
me
no
it
isn
t
so
from
my
boyhood
i
have
had
a
passionate
desire
of
literary
fame
deep
down
below
all
the
surface
faults
of
my
character
the
best
of
my
life
has
gone
by
and
it
drives
me
to
despair
when
i
feel
that
i
have
not
gained
the
position
due
to
me
there
is
only
one
way
of
doing
this
now
and
that
is
by
becoming
the
editor
of
an
important
periodical
only
in
that
way
shall
i
succeed
in
forcing
people
to
pay
attention
to
my
claims
many
a
man
goes
to
his
grave
unrecognised
just
because
he
has
never
had
a
fair
judgment
nowadays
it
is
the
unscrupulous
men
of
business
who
hold
the
attention
of
the
public
they
blow
their
trumpets
so
loudly
that
the
voices
of
honest
men
have
no
chance
of
being
marian
was
pained
by
the
humility
of
his
pleading
with
her
for
what
was
all
this
but
an
endeavour
to
move
her
sympathies
and
by
the
necessity
she
was
under
of
seeming
to
turn
a
deaf
ear
she
believed
that
there
was
some
truth
in
his
estimate
of
his
own
powers
though
as
an
editor
he
would
almost
certainly
fail
as
a
man
of
letters
he
had
probably
done
far
better
work
than
some
who
had
passed
him
by
on
their
way
to
popularity
circumstances
might
enable
her
to
assist
him
though
not
in
the
way
he
proposed
the
worst
of
it
was
that
she
could
not
let
him
see
what
was
in
her
mind
he
must
think
that
she
was
simply
balancing
her
own
satisfaction
against
his
when
in
truth
she
suffered
from
the
conviction
that
to
yield
would
be
as
unwise
in
regard
to
her
father
s
future
as
it
would
be
perilous
to
her
own
prospect
of
happiness
shall
we
leave
this
to
be
talked
of
when
the
money
has
been
paid
over
to
me
she
said
after
a
silence
yes
don
t
suppose
i
wish
to
influence
you
by
dwelling
on
my
own
hardships
that
would
be
contemptible
i
have
only
taken
this
opportunity
of
making
myself
better
known
to
you
i
don
t
readily
talk
of
myself
and
in
general
my
real
feelings
are
hidden
by
the
faults
of
my
temper
in
suggesting
how
you
could
do
me
a
great
service
and
at
the
same
time
reap
advantage
for
yourself
i
couldn
t
but
remember
how
little
reason
you
have
to
think
kindly
of
me
but
we
will
postpone
further
talk
you
will
think
over
what
i
have
said
marian
promised
that
she
would
and
was
glad
to
bring
the
conversation
to
an
end
when
sunday
came
yule
inquired
of
his
daughter
if
she
had
any
engagement
for
the
afternoon
yes
i
have
she
replied
with
an
effort
to
disguise
her
embarrassment
i
m
sorry
i
thought
of
asking
you
to
come
with
me
to
quarmby
s
shall
you
be
away
through
the
evening
till
about
nine
o
clock
i
ah
never
mind
never
he
tried
to
dismiss
the
matter
as
if
it
were
of
no
moment
but
marian
saw
the
shadow
that
passed
over
his
countenance
this
was
just
after
breakfast
for
the
remainder
of
the
morning
she
did
not
meet
him
and
at
the
dinner
he
was
silent
though
he
brought
no
book
to
the
table
with
him
as
he
was
wont
to
do
when
in
his
dark
moods
marian
talked
with
her
mother
doing
her
best
to
preserve
the
appearance
of
cheerfulness
which
was
natural
since
the
change
in
yule
s
demeanour
she
chanced
to
meet
her
father
in
the
passage
just
as
she
was
going
out
he
smiled
it
was
more
like
a
grin
of
pain
and
nodded
but
said
nothing
when
the
front
door
closed
he
went
into
the
parlour
mrs
yule
was
reading
or
at
all
events
turning
over
a
volume
of
an
illustrated
magazine
where
do
you
suppose
she
has
gone
he
asked
in
a
voice
which
was
only
distant
not
offensive
to
the
miss
milvains
i
believe
mrs
yule
answered
looking
aside
did
she
tell
you
so
no
we
don
t
talk
about
he
seated
himself
on
the
corner
of
a
chair
and
bent
forward
his
chin
in
his
hand
has
she
said
anything
to
you
about
the
review
not
a
she
glanced
at
him
timidly
and
turned
a
few
pages
of
her
book
i
wanted
her
to
come
to
quarmby
s
because
there
ll
be
a
man
there
who
is
anxious
that
jedwood
should
start
a
magazine
and
it
would
be
useful
for
her
to
hear
practical
opinions
there
d
be
no
harm
if
you
just
spoke
to
her
about
it
now
and
then
of
course
if
she
has
made
up
her
mind
to
refuse
me
it
s
no
use
troubling
myself
any
more
i
should
think
you
might
find
out
what
s
really
going
only
dire
stress
of
circumstances
could
have
brought
alfred
yule
to
make
distinct
appeal
for
his
wife
s
help
there
was
no
underhand
plotting
between
them
to
influence
their
daughter
mrs
yule
had
as
much
desire
for
the
happiness
of
her
husband
as
for
that
of
marian
but
she
felt
powerless
to
effect
anything
on
either
side
if
ever
she
says
anything
i
ll
let
you
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
a
right
to
question
i
can
t
do
that
unfortunately
there
are
a
good
many
things
you
can
t
with
that
remark
familiar
to
his
wife
in
substance
though
the
tone
of
it
was
less
caustic
than
usual
he
rose
and
sauntered
from
the
room
he
spent
a
gloomy
hour
in
the
study
then
went
off
to
join
the
literary
circle
at
mr
quarmby
s
chapter
xxiv
jasper
s
magnanimity
occasionally
milvain
met
his
sisters
as
they
came
out
of
church
on
sunday
morning
and
walked
home
to
have
dinner
with
them
he
did
so
though
the
sky
was
cheerless
and
a
strong
wind
made
it
anything
but
agreeable
to
wait
about
in
open
spaces
are
you
going
to
mrs
wright
s
this
afternoon
he
asked
as
they
went
on
together
i
thought
of
going
replied
maud
marian
will
be
with
you
ought
both
to
go
you
mustn
t
neglect
that
he
said
nothing
more
just
then
but
when
presently
he
was
alone
with
dora
in
the
for
a
few
minutes
he
turned
with
a
peculiar
smile
and
remarked
quietly
i
think
you
had
better
go
with
maud
this
but
i
can
t
i
expect
marian
at
that
s
just
why
i
want
you
to
she
looked
her
surprise
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
marian
we
ll
manage
it
in
this
way
at
a
quarter
to
three
you
two
shall
start
and
as
you
go
out
you
can
tell
the
landlady
that
if
miss
yule
comes
she
is
to
wait
for
you
as
you
won
t
be
long
she
ll
come
upstairs
and
i
shall
be
there
you
see
dora
turned
half
away
disturbed
a
little
but
not
displeased
and
what
about
miss
rupert
she
asked
oh
miss
rupert
may
go
to
jericho
for
all
i
care
i
m
in
a
magnanimous
very
i
ve
no
well
you
ll
do
this
one
of
the
results
of
poverty
you
see
one
can
t
even
have
a
private
conversation
with
a
friend
without
plotting
to
get
the
use
of
a
room
but
there
shall
be
an
end
of
this
state
of
he
nodded
significantly
thereupon
dora
left
the
room
to
speak
with
her
sister
the
device
was
put
into
execution
and
jasper
saw
his
sisters
depart
knowing
that
they
were
not
likely
to
return
for
some
three
hours
he
seated
himself
comfortably
by
the
fire
and
mused
five
minutes
had
hardly
gone
by
when
he
looked
at
his
watch
thinking
marian
must
be
unpunctual
he
was
nervous
though
he
had
believed
himself
secure
against
such
weakness
his
presence
here
with
the
purpose
he
had
in
his
mind
seemed
to
him
distinctly
a
concession
to
impulses
he
ought
to
have
controlled
but
to
this
resolve
he
had
come
and
it
was
now
too
late
to
recommence
the
arguments
with
himself
too
late
well
not
strictly
so
he
had
committed
himself
to
nothing
up
to
the
last
moment
of
freedom
he
could
always
that
was
doubtless
marian
s
knock
at
the
front
door
he
jumped
up
walked
the
length
of
the
room
sat
down
on
another
chair
returned
to
his
former
seat
then
the
door
opened
and
marian
came
in
she
was
not
surprised
the
landlady
had
mentioned
to
her
that
mr
milvain
was
upstairs
waiting
the
return
of
his
sisters
i
am
to
make
dora
s
excuses
jasper
said
she
begged
you
would
forgive
her
that
you
would
oh
and
you
were
to
be
sure
to
take
off
your
hat
he
added
in
a
laughing
tone
and
to
let
me
put
your
umbrella
in
the
corner
like
he
had
always
admired
the
shape
of
marian
s
head
and
the
beauty
of
her
short
soft
curly
hair
as
he
watched
her
uncovering
it
he
was
pleased
with
the
grace
of
her
arms
and
the
pliancy
of
her
slight
figure
which
is
usually
your
chair
i
m
sure
i
don
t
when
one
goes
to
see
a
friend
frequently
one
gets
into
regular
habits
in
these
matters
in
biffen
s
garret
i
used
to
have
the
most
uncomfortable
chair
it
was
ever
my
lot
to
sit
upon
still
i
came
to
feel
an
affection
for
it
at
reardon
s
i
always
had
what
was
supposed
to
be
the
most
luxurious
seat
but
it
was
too
small
for
me
and
i
eyed
it
resentfully
on
sitting
down
and
have
you
any
news
about
the
reardons
yes
i
am
told
that
reardon
has
had
the
offer
of
a
secretaryship
to
a
boys
home
or
something
of
the
kind
at
croydon
but
i
suppose
there
ll
be
no
need
for
him
to
think
of
that
surely
not
oh
there
s
no
why
should
he
do
work
of
that
kind
now
perhaps
his
wife
will
tell
him
that
she
wants
her
money
all
for
marian
laughed
it
was
very
rarely
that
jasper
had
heard
her
laugh
at
all
and
never
so
spontaneously
as
this
he
liked
the
music
you
haven
t
a
very
good
opinion
of
mrs
reardon
she
said
she
is
a
difficult
person
to
judge
i
never
disliked
her
by
any
means
but
she
was
decidedly
out
of
place
as
the
wife
of
a
struggling
author
perhaps
i
have
been
a
little
prejudiced
against
her
since
reardon
quarrelled
with
me
on
her
marian
was
astonished
at
this
explanation
of
the
rupture
between
milvain
and
his
friend
that
they
had
not
seen
each
other
for
some
months
she
knew
from
jasper
himself
but
no
definite
cause
had
been
assigned
i
may
as
well
let
you
know
all
about
it
milvain
continued
seeing
that
he
had
disconcerted
the
girl
as
he
meant
to
i
met
reardon
not
long
after
they
had
parted
and
he
charged
me
with
being
in
great
part
the
cause
of
his
the
listener
did
not
raise
her
eyes
you
would
never
imagine
what
my
fault
was
reardon
declared
that
the
tone
of
my
conversation
had
been
morally
injurious
to
his
wife
he
said
i
was
always
glorifying
worldly
success
and
that
this
had
made
her
discontented
with
her
lot
sounds
rather
ludicrous
don
t
you
think
it
was
very
reardon
was
in
desperate
earnest
poor
fellow
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
fear
there
may
have
been
something
in
his
complaint
i
told
him
at
once
that
i
should
henceforth
keep
away
from
mrs
edmund
yule
s
and
so
i
have
done
with
the
result
of
course
that
they
suppose
i
condemn
mrs
reardon
s
behaviour
the
affair
was
a
nuisance
but
i
had
no
choice
i
you
say
that
perhaps
your
talk
really
was
harmful
to
it
may
have
been
though
such
a
danger
never
occurred
to
then
amy
must
be
very
to
be
influenced
by
such
a
paltry
fellow
to
be
influenced
by
anyone
in
such
a
you
think
the
worse
of
me
for
this
story
jasper
asked
i
don
t
quite
understand
it
how
did
you
talk
to
her
as
i
talk
to
everyone
you
have
heard
me
say
the
same
things
many
a
time
i
simply
declare
my
opinion
that
the
end
of
literary
work
unless
one
is
a
man
of
genius
is
to
secure
comfort
and
repute
this
doesn
t
seem
to
me
very
scandalous
but
mrs
reardon
was
perhaps
too
urgent
in
repeating
such
views
to
her
husband
she
saw
that
in
my
case
they
were
likely
to
have
solid
results
and
it
was
a
misery
to
her
that
reardon
couldn
t
or
wouldn
t
work
in
the
same
practical
way
it
was
very
and
you
are
inclined
to
blame
me
no
because
i
am
so
sure
that
you
only
spoke
in
the
way
natural
to
you
without
a
thought
of
such
jasper
smiled
that
s
precisely
the
truth
nearly
all
men
who
have
their
way
to
make
think
as
i
do
but
most
feel
obliged
to
adopt
a
false
tone
to
talk
about
literary
conscientiousness
and
so
on
i
simply
say
what
i
think
with
no
pretences
i
should
like
to
be
conscientious
but
it
s
a
luxury
i
can
t
afford
i
ve
told
you
all
this
often
enough
you
but
it
hasn
t
been
morally
injurious
to
you
he
said
with
a
laugh
not
at
all
still
i
don
t
like
jasper
was
startled
he
gazed
at
her
ought
he
then
to
have
dealt
with
her
less
frankly
had
he
been
mistaken
in
thinking
that
the
unusual
openness
of
his
talk
was
attractive
to
her
she
spoke
with
quite
unaccustomed
decision
indeed
he
had
noticed
from
her
entrance
that
there
was
something
unfamiliar
in
her
way
of
conversing
she
was
so
much
more
than
of
wont
and
did
not
seem
to
treat
him
with
the
same
deference
the
same
subdual
of
her
own
personality
you
don
t
like
it
he
repeated
calmly
it
has
become
rather
tiresome
to
you
i
feel
sorry
that
you
should
always
represent
yourself
in
an
unfavourable
he
was
an
acute
man
but
the
with
which
he
had
entered
upon
this
dialogue
his
conviction
that
he
had
but
to
speak
when
he
wished
to
receive
assurance
of
marian
s
devotion
prevented
him
from
understanding
the
tone
of
independence
she
had
suddenly
adopted
with
more
modesty
he
would
have
felt
more
subtly
at
this
juncture
would
have
divined
that
the
girl
had
an
exquisite
pleasure
in
drawing
back
now
that
she
saw
him
approaching
her
with
unmistakable
purpose
that
she
wished
to
be
wooed
in
less
fashion
before
confessing
what
was
in
her
heart
for
the
moment
he
was
disconcerted
those
last
words
of
hers
had
a
slight
tone
of
superiority
the
last
thing
he
would
have
expected
upon
her
lips
yet
i
surely
haven
t
always
appeared
so
to
you
he
said
no
not
but
you
are
in
doubt
concerning
the
real
man
i
m
not
sure
that
i
understand
you
you
say
that
you
do
really
think
as
you
so
i
do
i
think
that
there
is
no
choice
for
a
man
who
can
t
bear
poverty
i
have
never
said
though
that
i
had
pleasure
in
mean
necessities
i
accept
them
because
i
can
t
help
it
was
a
delight
to
marian
to
observe
the
anxiety
with
which
he
turned
to
never
in
her
life
had
she
felt
this
joy
of
holding
a
position
of
command
it
was
nothing
to
her
that
jasper
valued
her
more
because
of
her
money
impossible
for
it
to
be
otherwise
satisfied
that
he
did
value
her
to
begin
with
for
her
own
sake
she
was
very
willing
to
accept
money
as
her
ally
in
the
winning
of
his
love
he
scarcely
loved
her
yet
as
she
understood
the
feeling
but
she
perceived
her
power
over
him
and
passion
taught
her
how
to
exert
it
but
you
resign
yourself
very
cheerfully
to
the
necessity
she
said
looking
at
him
with
merely
intellectual
eyes
you
had
rather
i
lamented
my
fate
in
not
being
able
to
devote
myself
to
nobly
unremunerative
work
there
was
a
note
of
irony
here
it
caused
her
a
tremor
but
she
held
her
position
that
you
never
do
so
would
make
one
think
but
i
won
t
speak
that
i
neither
care
for
good
work
nor
am
capable
of
it
jasper
finished
her
sentence
i
shouldn
t
have
thought
it
would
make
you
think
instead
of
replying
she
turned
her
look
towards
the
door
there
was
a
footstep
on
the
stairs
but
it
passed
i
thought
it
might
be
dora
she
said
she
won
t
be
here
for
another
couple
of
hours
at
least
replied
jasper
with
a
slight
smile
but
you
said
i
sent
her
to
mrs
boston
wright
s
that
i
might
have
an
opportunity
of
talking
to
you
will
you
forgive
the
stratagem
marian
resumed
her
former
attitude
the
faintest
smile
hovering
about
her
lips
i
m
glad
there
s
plenty
of
time
he
continued
i
begin
to
suspect
that
you
have
been
misunderstanding
me
of
late
i
must
set
that
i
don
t
think
i
have
misunderstood
that
may
mean
something
very
disagreeable
i
know
that
some
people
whom
i
esteem
have
a
very
poor
opinion
of
me
but
i
can
t
allow
you
to
be
one
of
them
what
do
i
seem
to
you
what
is
the
result
on
your
mind
of
all
our
conversations
i
have
already
told
not
seriously
do
you
believe
i
am
capable
of
generous
feeling
to
say
no
would
be
to
put
you
in
the
lowest
class
of
men
and
that
a
very
small
good
then
i
am
not
among
the
basest
but
that
doesn
t
give
me
very
distinguished
claims
upon
your
consideration
whatever
i
am
i
am
high
in
some
of
my
which
of
them
for
instance
i
have
been
daring
enough
to
hope
that
you
might
love
marian
delayed
for
a
moment
then
said
quietly
why
do
you
call
that
daring
because
i
have
enough
of
thought
to
believe
that
a
woman
who
is
worthy
of
a
man
s
love
is
higher
than
he
and
condescends
in
giving
herself
to
his
voice
was
not
convincing
the
phrase
did
not
sound
natural
on
his
lips
it
was
not
thus
that
she
had
hoped
to
hear
him
speak
whilst
he
expressed
himself
thus
conventionally
he
did
not
love
her
as
she
desired
to
be
loved
i
don
t
hold
that
view
she
said
it
doesn
t
surprise
me
you
are
very
reserved
on
all
subjects
and
we
have
never
spoken
of
this
but
of
course
i
know
that
your
thought
is
never
commonplace
hold
what
view
you
like
of
woman
s
position
that
doesn
t
affect
is
yours
commonplace
then
desperately
love
is
a
very
old
and
common
thing
and
i
believe
i
love
you
in
the
old
and
common
way
i
think
you
beautiful
you
seem
to
me
womanly
in
the
best
sense
full
of
charm
and
sweetness
i
know
myself
a
coarse
being
in
comparison
all
this
has
been
felt
and
said
in
the
same
way
by
men
infinite
in
variety
must
i
find
some
new
expression
before
you
can
believe
me
marian
kept
silence
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
he
said
the
thought
is
as
inevitable
as
my
consciousness
of
for
an
instant
she
looked
at
him
yes
you
look
the
thought
why
have
i
not
spoken
to
you
in
this
way
before
why
have
i
waited
until
you
are
obliged
to
suspect
my
sincerity
my
thought
is
not
so
easily
read
then
said
marian
to
be
sure
it
hasn
t
a
gross
form
but
i
know
you
wish
whatever
your
real
feeling
towards
me
that
i
had
spoken
a
fortnight
ago
you
would
wish
that
of
any
man
in
my
position
merely
because
it
is
painful
to
you
to
see
a
possible
insincerity
well
i
am
not
insincere
i
have
thought
of
you
as
of
no
other
woman
for
some
time
but
yes
you
shall
have
the
plain
coarse
truth
which
is
good
in
its
way
no
doubt
i
was
afraid
to
say
that
i
loved
you
you
don
t
flinch
so
far
so
good
now
what
harm
is
there
in
this
confession
in
the
common
course
of
things
i
shouldn
t
be
in
a
position
to
marry
for
perhaps
three
or
four
years
and
even
then
marriage
would
mean
difficulties
restraints
obstacles
i
have
always
dreaded
the
thought
of
marriage
with
a
poor
income
you
remember
love
in
a
hut
with
water
and
a
crust
is
love
forgive
us
cinders
ashes
dust
you
know
that
is
not
always
i
dare
but
for
the
vast
majority
of
mortals
there
s
the
instance
of
the
reardons
they
were
in
love
with
each
other
if
ever
two
people
were
but
poverty
ruined
everything
i
am
not
in
the
confidence
of
either
of
them
but
i
feel
sure
each
has
wished
the
other
dead
what
else
was
to
be
expected
should
i
have
dared
to
take
a
wife
in
my
present
circumstances
a
wife
as
poor
as
myself
you
will
be
in
a
much
better
position
before
long
said
marian
if
you
loved
me
why
should
you
have
been
afraid
to
ask
me
to
have
confidence
in
your
future
it
s
all
so
uncertain
it
may
be
another
ten
years
before
i
can
count
on
an
income
of
five
or
six
hundred
pounds
if
i
have
to
struggle
on
in
the
common
but
tell
me
what
is
your
aim
in
life
what
do
you
understand
by
success
yes
i
will
tell
you
my
aim
is
to
have
easy
command
of
all
the
pleasures
desired
by
a
cultivated
man
i
want
to
live
among
beautiful
things
and
never
to
be
troubled
by
a
thought
of
vulgar
difficulties
i
want
to
travel
and
enrich
my
mind
in
foreign
countries
i
want
to
associate
on
equal
terms
with
refined
and
interesting
people
i
want
to
be
known
to
be
familiarly
referred
to
to
feel
when
i
enter
a
room
that
people
regard
me
with
some
he
looked
steadily
at
her
with
bright
eyes
and
that
s
all
asked
marian
that
is
very
much
perhaps
you
don
t
know
how
i
suffer
in
feeling
myself
at
a
disadvantage
my
instincts
are
strongly
social
yet
i
can
t
be
at
my
ease
in
society
simply
because
i
can
t
do
justice
to
myself
want
of
money
makes
me
the
inferior
of
the
people
i
talk
with
though
i
might
be
superior
to
them
in
most
things
i
am
ignorant
in
many
ways
and
merely
because
i
am
poor
imagine
my
never
having
been
out
of
england
it
shames
me
when
people
talk
familiarly
of
the
continent
so
with
regard
to
all
manner
of
amusements
and
pursuits
at
home
impossible
for
me
to
appear
among
my
acquaintances
at
the
theatre
at
concerts
i
am
perpetually
at
a
disadvantage
i
haven
t
fair
play
suppose
me
possessed
of
money
enough
to
live
a
full
and
active
life
for
the
next
five
years
why
at
the
end
of
that
time
my
position
would
be
secure
to
him
that
hath
shall
be
given
you
know
how
universally
true
that
and
yet
came
in
a
low
voice
from
marian
you
say
that
you
love
you
mean
that
i
speak
as
if
no
such
thing
as
love
existed
but
you
asked
me
what
i
understood
by
success
i
am
speaking
of
worldly
things
now
suppose
i
had
said
to
you
my
one
aim
and
desire
in
life
is
to
win
your
love
could
you
have
believed
me
such
phrases
are
always
untrue
i
don
t
know
how
it
can
give
anyone
pleasure
to
hear
them
but
if
i
say
to
you
all
the
satisfactions
i
have
described
would
be
immensely
heightened
if
they
were
shared
with
a
woman
who
loved
me
there
is
the
simple
marian
s
heart
sank
she
did
not
want
truth
such
as
this
she
would
have
preferred
that
he
should
utter
the
poor
common
falsehoods
hungry
for
passionate
love
she
heard
with
a
sense
of
desolation
all
this
calm
reasoning
that
jasper
was
of
cold
temperament
she
had
often
feared
yet
there
was
always
the
consoling
thought
that
she
did
not
see
with
perfect
clearness
into
his
nature
now
and
then
had
come
a
flash
a
hint
of
possibilities
she
had
looked
forward
with
trembling
eagerness
to
some
sudden
revelation
but
it
seemed
as
if
he
knew
no
word
of
the
language
which
would
have
called
such
joyous
response
from
her
expectant
soul
we
have
talked
for
a
long
time
she
said
turning
her
head
as
if
his
last
words
were
of
no
significance
as
dora
is
not
coming
i
think
i
will
go
she
rose
and
went
towards
the
chair
on
which
lay
her
things
at
once
jasper
stepped
to
her
side
you
will
go
without
giving
me
any
answer
answer
to
what
will
you
be
my
wife
it
is
too
soon
to
ask
me
too
soon
haven
t
you
known
for
months
that
i
thought
of
you
with
far
more
than
friendliness
how
was
it
possible
i
should
know
that
you
have
explained
to
me
why
you
would
not
let
your
real
feelings
be
the
reproach
was
merited
and
not
easy
to
be
outfaced
he
turned
away
for
an
instant
then
with
a
sudden
movement
caught
both
her
hands
whatever
i
have
done
or
said
or
thought
in
the
past
that
is
of
no
account
now
i
love
you
marian
i
want
you
to
be
my
wife
i
have
never
seen
any
other
girl
who
impressed
me
as
you
did
from
the
first
if
i
had
been
weak
enough
to
try
to
win
anyone
but
you
i
should
have
known
that
i
had
turned
aside
from
the
path
of
my
true
happiness
let
us
forget
for
a
moment
all
our
circumstances
i
hold
your
hands
and
look
into
your
face
and
say
that
i
love
you
whatever
answer
you
give
i
love
you
till
now
her
heart
had
only
fluttered
a
little
it
was
a
great
part
of
her
distress
that
the
love
she
had
so
long
nurtured
seemed
shrinking
together
into
some
far
corner
of
her
being
whilst
she
listened
to
the
discourses
which
prefaced
jasper
s
declaration
she
was
nervous
painfully
touched
with
maidenly
shame
but
could
not
abandon
herself
to
that
delicious
emotion
which
ought
to
have
been
the
fulfilment
of
all
her
secret
imaginings
now
at
length
there
began
a
throbbing
in
her
bosom
keeping
her
face
averted
her
eyes
cast
down
she
waited
for
a
repetition
of
the
note
that
was
in
that
last
i
love
she
felt
a
change
in
the
hands
that
held
hers
a
warmth
a
moist
softness
it
caused
a
shock
through
her
veins
he
was
trying
to
draw
her
nearer
but
she
kept
at
full
arm
s
length
and
looked
irresponsive
marian
she
wished
to
answer
but
a
spirit
of
perversity
held
her
tongue
marian
don
t
you
love
me
or
have
i
offended
you
by
my
way
of
speaking
persisting
she
at
length
withdrew
her
hands
jasper
s
face
expressed
something
like
dismay
you
have
not
offended
me
she
said
but
i
am
not
sure
that
you
don
t
deceive
yourself
in
thinking
for
the
moment
that
i
am
necessary
to
your
the
emotional
current
which
had
passed
from
her
flesh
to
his
whilst
their
hands
were
linked
made
him
incapable
of
standing
aloof
from
her
he
saw
that
her
face
and
neck
were
warmer
hued
and
her
beauty
became
more
desirable
to
him
than
ever
yet
you
are
more
to
me
than
anything
else
in
the
compass
of
life
he
exclaimed
again
pressing
forward
i
think
of
nothing
but
you
you
yourself
my
beautiful
gentle
thoughtful
marian
his
arm
captured
her
and
she
did
not
resist
a
sob
then
a
strange
little
laugh
betrayed
the
passion
that
was
at
length
unfolded
in
her
you
do
love
me
marian
i
love
and
there
followed
the
antiphony
of
ardour
that
finds
its
first
utterance
a
subdued
music
often
interrupted
ever
returning
upon
the
same
rich
note
marian
closed
her
eyes
and
abandoned
herself
to
the
luxury
of
the
dream
it
was
her
first
complete
escape
from
the
world
of
intellectual
routine
her
first
taste
of
life
all
the
pedantry
of
her
daily
toil
slipped
away
like
a
cumbrous
garment
she
was
clad
only
in
her
womanhood
once
or
twice
a
shudder
of
strange
went
through
her
and
she
felt
guilty
immodest
but
upon
that
sensation
followed
a
surge
of
passionate
joy
obliterating
memory
and
forethought
how
shall
i
see
you
jasper
asked
at
length
where
can
we
meet
it
was
a
difficulty
the
season
no
longer
allowed
lingerings
under
the
open
sky
but
marian
could
not
go
to
his
lodgings
and
it
seemed
impossible
for
him
to
visit
her
at
her
home
will
your
father
persist
in
unfriendliness
to
me
she
was
only
just
beginning
to
reflect
on
all
that
was
involved
in
this
new
relation
i
have
no
hope
that
he
will
change
she
said
sadly
he
will
refuse
to
countenance
your
marriage
i
shall
disappoint
him
and
grieve
him
bitterly
he
has
asked
me
to
use
my
money
in
starting
a
new
which
he
is
to
edit
yes
do
you
think
there
would
be
any
hope
of
its
success
jasper
shook
his
head
your
father
is
not
the
man
for
that
marian
i
don
t
say
it
disrespectfully
i
mean
that
he
doesn
t
seem
to
me
to
have
that
kind
of
aptitude
it
would
be
a
disastrous
i
felt
that
of
course
i
can
t
think
of
it
she
smiled
raising
her
face
to
his
don
t
trouble
said
jasper
wait
a
little
till
i
have
made
myself
independent
of
fadge
and
a
few
other
men
and
your
father
shall
see
how
heartily
i
wish
to
be
of
use
to
him
he
will
miss
your
help
i
m
afraid
yes
i
shall
feel
it
a
cruelty
when
i
have
to
leave
him
he
has
only
just
told
me
that
his
sight
is
beginning
to
fail
oh
why
didn
t
his
brother
leave
him
a
little
money
it
was
such
unkindness
surely
he
had
a
much
better
right
than
amy
or
than
myself
either
but
literature
has
been
a
curse
to
father
all
his
life
my
uncle
hated
it
and
i
suppose
that
was
why
he
left
father
but
how
am
i
to
see
you
often
that
s
the
first
question
i
know
what
i
shall
do
i
must
take
new
lodgings
for
the
girls
and
myself
all
in
the
same
house
we
must
have
two
then
you
will
come
to
my
room
without
any
difficulty
these
astonishing
proprieties
are
so
easily
satisfied
after
you
will
really
do
that
yes
i
shall
go
and
look
for
rooms
then
when
you
come
you
can
always
ask
for
maud
or
dora
you
know
they
will
be
very
glad
of
a
change
to
more
respectable
i
won
t
stay
to
see
them
now
jasper
said
marian
her
thoughts
turning
to
the
girls
very
well
you
are
safe
for
another
hour
but
to
make
certain
you
shall
go
at
a
quarter
to
five
your
mother
won
t
be
against
us
poor
mother
no
but
she
won
t
dare
to
justify
me
before
i
feel
as
if
i
should
play
a
mean
part
in
leaving
it
to
you
to
tell
your
father
marian
i
will
brave
it
out
and
go
and
see
oh
it
would
be
better
not
then
i
will
write
to
him
such
a
letter
as
he
can
t
possibly
take
in
ill
marian
pondered
this
proposal
you
shall
do
that
jasper
if
you
are
willing
but
not
yet
you
don
t
wish
him
to
know
at
once
we
had
better
wait
a
little
you
know
she
added
laughing
that
my
legacy
is
only
in
name
mine
as
yet
the
will
hasn
t
been
proved
and
then
the
money
will
have
to
be
she
informed
him
of
the
details
jasper
listened
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
they
were
now
sitting
on
chairs
drawn
close
to
each
other
it
was
with
a
sense
of
relief
that
jasper
had
passed
from
dithyrambs
to
conversation
on
practical
points
marian
s
excited
sensitiveness
could
not
but
observe
this
and
she
kept
watching
the
motions
of
his
countenance
at
length
he
even
let
go
her
hand
you
would
prefer
he
said
reflectively
that
nothing
should
be
said
to
your
father
until
that
business
is
finished
if
you
consent
to
oh
i
have
no
doubt
it
s
as
her
little
phrase
of
and
its
tremulous
tone
called
for
another
answer
than
this
jasper
fell
again
into
thought
and
clearly
it
was
thought
of
practical
things
i
think
i
must
go
now
jasper
she
said
must
you
well
if
you
had
he
rose
though
she
was
still
seated
marian
moved
a
few
steps
away
but
turned
and
approached
him
again
do
you
really
love
me
she
asked
taking
one
of
his
hands
and
folding
it
between
her
own
i
do
indeed
love
you
marian
are
you
still
doubtful
you
re
not
sorry
that
i
must
go
but
i
am
dearest
i
wish
we
could
sit
here
undisturbed
all
through
the
her
touch
had
the
same
effect
as
before
his
blood
warmed
again
and
he
pressed
her
to
his
side
stroking
her
hair
and
kissing
her
forehead
are
you
sorry
i
wear
my
hair
short
she
asked
longing
for
more
praise
than
he
had
bestowed
on
her
sorry
it
is
perfect
everything
else
seems
vulgar
compared
with
this
way
of
yours
how
strange
you
would
look
with
plaits
and
that
kind
of
thing
i
am
so
glad
it
pleases
there
is
nothing
in
you
that
doesn
t
please
me
my
thoughtful
you
called
me
that
before
do
i
seem
so
very
thoughtful
so
grave
and
sweetly
reserved
and
with
eyes
so
full
of
she
quivered
with
delight
her
face
hidden
against
his
breast
i
seem
to
be
jasper
everything
in
the
world
is
new
to
me
and
i
am
strange
to
myself
i
have
never
known
an
hour
of
happiness
till
now
and
i
can
t
believe
yet
that
it
has
come
to
she
at
length
attired
herself
and
they
left
the
house
together
of
course
not
unobserved
by
the
landlady
jasper
walked
about
half
the
way
to
st
paul
s
crescent
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
address
a
letter
for
her
to
the
care
of
his
sisters
but
in
a
day
or
two
the
change
of
lodgings
would
be
effected
when
they
had
parted
marian
looked
back
but
jasper
was
walking
quickly
away
his
head
bent
in
profound
meditation
chapter
xxv
a
fruitless
meeting
refuge
from
despair
is
often
found
in
the
passion
of
and
that
spirit
of
obstinate
resistance
which
it
engenders
in
certain
natures
the
extreme
of
is
intolerable
and
leads
to
but
there
are
less
fortunate
beings
whom
the
vehemence
of
their
revolt
against
fate
strengthens
to
endure
in
suffering
these
latter
are
rather
imaginative
than
passionate
the
stages
of
their
woe
impress
them
as
the
acts
of
a
drama
which
they
can
not
bring
themselves
to
cut
short
so
various
are
the
possibilities
of
its
dark
motive
the
intellectual
man
who
kills
himself
is
most
often
brought
to
that
decision
by
conviction
of
his
insignificance
merges
in
and
the
humiliated
soul
is
intolerant
of
existence
he
who
survives
under
like
conditions
does
so
because
misery
magnifies
him
in
his
own
estimate
it
was
by
force
of
commiserating
his
own
lot
that
edwin
reardon
continued
to
live
through
the
first
month
after
his
parting
from
amy
once
or
twice
a
week
sometimes
early
in
the
evening
sometimes
at
midnight
or
later
he
haunted
the
street
at
westbourne
park
where
his
wife
was
dwelling
and
on
each
occasion
he
returned
to
his
garret
with
a
fortified
sense
of
the
injustice
to
which
he
was
submitted
of
revolt
against
the
circumstances
which
had
driven
him
into
outer
darkness
of
bitterness
against
his
wife
for
saving
her
own
comfort
rather
than
share
his
downfall
at
times
he
was
not
far
from
that
state
of
sheer
distraction
which
mrs
edmund
yule
preferred
to
suppose
that
he
had
reached
an
extraordinary
arrogance
now
and
then
possessed
him
he
stood
amid
his
poor
surroundings
with
the
sensations
of
an
outraged
exile
and
laughed
aloud
in
furious
contempt
of
all
who
censured
or
pitied
him
on
hearing
from
jasper
milvain
that
amy
had
fallen
ill
or
at
all
events
was
suffering
in
health
from
what
she
had
gone
through
he
felt
a
momentary
pang
which
all
but
determined
him
to
hasten
to
her
side
the
reaction
was
a
feeling
of
distinct
pleasure
that
she
had
her
share
of
pain
and
even
a
hope
that
her
illness
might
become
grave
he
pictured
himself
summoned
to
her
sick
chamber
imagined
her
begging
his
forgiveness
but
it
was
not
merely
nor
in
great
part
a
malicious
satisfaction
he
succeeded
in
believing
that
amy
suffered
because
she
still
had
a
remnant
of
love
for
him
as
the
days
went
by
and
he
heard
nothing
disappointment
and
resentment
occupied
him
at
length
he
ceased
to
haunt
the
neighbourhood
his
desires
grew
sullen
he
became
fixed
in
the
resolve
to
hold
entirely
apart
and
doggedly
await
the
issue
at
the
end
of
each
month
he
sent
half
the
money
he
had
received
from
carter
simply
enclosing
postal
orders
in
an
envelope
addressed
to
his
wife
the
first
two
remittances
were
in
no
way
acknowledged
the
third
brought
a
short
note
from
amy
as
you
continue
to
send
these
sums
of
money
i
had
perhaps
better
let
you
know
that
i
can
not
use
them
for
any
purposes
of
my
own
perhaps
a
sense
of
duty
leads
you
to
make
this
sacrifice
but
i
am
afraid
it
is
more
likely
that
you
wish
to
remind
me
every
month
that
you
are
undergoing
privations
and
to
pain
me
in
this
way
what
you
have
sent
i
have
deposited
in
the
post
office
savings
bank
in
willie
s
name
and
i
shall
continue
to
do
for
a
day
or
two
reardon
persevered
in
an
intention
of
not
replying
but
the
desire
to
utter
his
turbid
feelings
became
in
the
end
too
strong
he
wrote
i
regard
it
as
quite
natural
that
you
should
put
the
worst
interpretation
on
whatever
i
do
as
for
my
privations
i
think
very
little
of
them
they
are
a
trifle
in
comparison
with
the
thought
that
i
am
forsaken
just
because
my
pocket
is
empty
and
i
am
far
indeed
from
thinking
that
you
can
be
pained
by
whatever
i
may
undergo
that
would
suppose
some
generosity
in
your
this
was
no
sooner
posted
than
he
would
gladly
have
recalled
it
he
knew
that
it
was
undignified
that
it
contained
as
many
falsehoods
as
lines
and
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
for
having
written
so
but
he
could
not
pen
a
letter
of
retractation
and
there
remained
with
him
a
new
cause
of
exasperated
wretchedness
excepting
the
people
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
at
the
hospital
he
had
no
society
but
that
of
biffen
the
realist
visited
him
once
a
week
and
this
friendship
grew
closer
than
it
had
been
in
the
time
of
reardon
s
prosperity
biffen
was
a
man
of
so
much
natural
delicacy
that
there
was
a
pleasure
in
imparting
to
him
the
details
of
private
sorrow
though
profoundly
sympathetic
he
did
his
best
to
oppose
reardon
s
harsher
judgments
of
amy
and
herein
he
gave
his
friend
a
satisfaction
which
might
not
be
avowed
i
really
do
not
see
he
exclaimed
as
they
sat
in
the
garret
one
night
of
midsummer
how
your
wife
could
have
acted
otherwise
of
course
i
am
quite
unable
to
judge
the
attitude
of
her
mind
but
i
think
i
can
t
help
thinking
from
what
i
knew
of
her
that
there
has
been
strictly
a
misunderstanding
between
you
it
was
a
hard
and
miserable
thing
that
she
should
have
to
leave
you
for
a
time
and
you
couldn
t
face
the
necessity
in
a
just
spirit
don
t
you
think
there
s
some
truth
in
this
way
of
looking
at
it
as
a
woman
it
was
her
part
to
soften
the
hateful
necessity
she
made
it
i
m
not
sure
that
you
don
t
demand
too
much
of
her
unhappily
i
know
little
or
nothing
of
women
but
i
have
a
suspicion
that
one
oughtn
t
to
expect
heroism
in
them
any
more
than
in
the
women
of
the
lower
classes
i
think
of
women
as
creatures
to
be
protected
is
a
man
justified
in
asking
them
to
be
stronger
than
himself
of
course
replied
reardon
there
s
no
use
in
demanding
more
than
a
character
is
capable
of
but
i
believed
her
of
finer
stuff
my
bitterness
comes
of
the
i
suppose
there
were
faults
of
temper
on
both
sides
and
you
saw
at
last
only
each
other
s
i
saw
the
truth
which
had
always
been
disguised
from
biffen
persisted
in
looking
doubtful
and
in
secret
reardon
thanked
him
for
it
as
the
realist
progressed
with
his
novel
mr
bailey
grocer
he
read
the
chapters
to
reardon
not
only
for
his
own
satisfaction
but
in
great
part
because
he
hoped
that
this
example
of
productivity
might
in
the
end
encourage
the
listener
to
resume
his
own
literary
tasks
reardon
found
much
to
criticise
in
his
friend
s
work
it
was
noteworthy
that
he
objected
and
condemned
with
much
less
hesitation
than
in
his
better
days
for
sensitive
reticence
is
one
of
the
virtues
wont
to
be
assailed
by
suffering
at
all
events
in
the
weaker
natures
biffen
purposely
urged
these
discussions
as
far
as
possible
and
doubtless
they
benefited
reardon
for
the
time
but
the
defeated
novelist
could
not
be
induced
to
undertake
another
practical
illustration
of
his
own
views
occasionally
he
had
an
impulse
to
plan
a
story
but
an
hour
s
turning
it
over
in
his
mind
sufficed
to
disgust
him
his
ideas
seemed
barren
vapid
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
write
half
a
dozen
pages
and
the
mere
thought
of
a
whole
book
overcame
him
with
the
dread
of
insurmountable
difficulties
immeasurable
toil
in
time
however
he
was
able
to
read
he
had
a
pleasure
in
contemplating
the
little
collection
of
sterling
books
that
alone
remained
to
him
from
his
library
the
sight
of
many
volumes
would
have
been
a
weariness
but
these
few
when
he
was
again
able
to
think
of
books
at
all
were
as
friendly
countenances
he
could
not
read
continuously
but
sometimes
he
opened
his
shakespeare
for
instance
and
dreamed
over
a
page
or
two
from
such
glimpses
there
remained
in
his
head
a
line
or
a
short
passage
which
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
wherever
he
went
generally
some
example
of
sweet
or
sonorous
metre
which
had
a
soothing
effect
upon
him
with
odd
result
on
one
occasion
he
was
walking
in
one
of
the
back
streets
of
islington
and
stopped
idly
to
gaze
into
the
window
of
some
small
shop
standing
thus
he
forgot
himself
and
presently
recited
aloud
caesar
tis
his
schoolmaster
an
argument
that
he
is
pluck
d
when
hither
he
sends
so
poor
a
pinion
of
his
wing
which
had
superfluous
kings
for
messengers
not
many
moons
gone
the
last
two
lines
he
uttered
a
second
time
enjoying
their
magnificent
sound
and
then
was
brought
back
to
consciousness
by
the
loud
mocking
laugh
of
two
men
standing
close
by
who
evidently
looked
upon
him
as
a
strayed
lunatic
he
kept
one
suit
of
clothes
for
his
hours
of
attendance
at
the
hospital
it
was
still
decent
and
with
much
care
would
remain
so
for
a
long
time
that
which
he
wore
at
home
and
in
his
street
wanderings
declared
poverty
at
every
point
it
had
been
discarded
before
he
left
the
old
abode
in
his
present
state
of
mind
he
cared
nothing
how
disreputable
he
looked
to
these
seedy
habiliments
were
the
token
of
his
degradation
and
at
times
he
regarded
them
happening
to
see
himself
in
a
shop
mirror
with
pleasurable
contempt
the
same
spirit
often
led
him
for
a
meal
to
the
poorest
of
places
where
he
rubbed
elbows
with
ragged
creatures
who
had
somehow
obtained
the
price
of
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
he
liked
to
contrast
himself
with
these
comrades
in
misfortune
this
is
the
rate
at
which
the
world
esteems
me
i
am
worth
no
better
provision
than
or
else
instead
of
emphasising
the
contrast
he
defiantly
took
a
place
among
the
miserables
of
the
nether
world
and
nursed
hatred
of
all
who
were
one
of
these
he
desired
to
regard
with
gratitude
but
found
it
difficult
to
support
that
feeling
carter
the
vivacious
though
at
first
perfectly
unembarrassed
in
his
relations
with
the
city
road
clerk
gradually
exhibited
a
change
of
demeanour
reardon
occasionally
found
the
young
man
s
eye
fixed
upon
him
with
a
singular
expression
and
the
secretary
s
talk
though
still
as
a
rule
genial
was
wont
to
suffer
curious
interruptions
during
which
he
seemed
to
be
musing
on
something
reardon
had
said
or
on
some
point
of
his
behaviour
the
explanation
of
this
was
that
carter
had
begun
to
think
there
might
be
a
foundation
for
mrs
yule
s
hypothesis
that
the
novelist
was
not
altogether
in
his
sound
senses
at
first
he
scouted
the
idea
but
as
time
went
on
it
seemed
to
him
that
reardon
s
countenance
certainly
had
a
gaunt
wildness
which
suggested
disagreeable
things
especially
did
he
remark
this
after
his
return
from
an
august
holiday
in
norway
on
coming
for
the
first
time
to
the
city
road
branch
he
sat
down
and
began
to
favour
reardon
with
a
lively
description
of
how
he
had
enjoyed
himself
abroad
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
such
talk
was
not
likely
to
inspirit
the
man
who
had
passed
his
august
between
the
garret
and
the
hospital
but
he
observed
before
long
that
his
listener
was
glancing
hither
and
thither
in
rather
a
strange
way
you
haven
t
been
ill
since
i
saw
you
he
inquired
oh
no
but
you
look
as
if
you
might
have
been
i
say
we
must
manage
for
you
to
have
a
fortnight
off
you
know
this
i
have
no
wish
for
it
said
reardon
i
ll
imagine
i
have
been
to
norway
it
has
done
me
good
to
hear
of
your
i
m
glad
of
that
but
it
isn
t
quite
the
same
thing
you
know
as
having
a
run
somewhere
oh
much
better
to
enjoy
myself
may
be
mere
selfishness
but
to
enjoy
another
s
enjoyment
is
the
purest
satisfaction
good
for
body
and
soul
i
am
cultivating
what
s
that
a
highly
rarefied
form
of
happiness
the
curious
thing
about
it
is
that
it
won
t
grow
unless
you
have
just
twice
as
much
faith
in
it
as
is
required
for
assent
to
the
athanasian
oh
carter
went
away
more
than
puzzled
he
told
his
wife
that
evening
that
reardon
had
been
talking
to
him
in
the
most
extraordinary
fashion
no
understanding
a
word
he
said
all
this
time
he
was
on
the
for
employment
that
would
be
more
suitable
to
his
unfortunate
clerk
whether
slightly
demented
or
not
reardon
gave
no
sign
of
inability
to
discharge
his
duties
he
was
conscientious
as
ever
and
might
unless
he
changed
greatly
be
relied
upon
in
positions
of
more
responsibility
than
his
present
one
and
at
length
early
in
october
there
came
to
the
secretary
s
knowledge
an
opportunity
with
which
he
lost
no
time
in
acquainting
reardon
the
latter
repaired
that
evening
to
clipstone
street
and
climbed
to
biffen
s
chamber
he
entered
with
a
cheerful
look
and
exclaimed
i
have
just
invented
a
riddle
see
if
you
can
guess
it
why
is
a
london
like
the
human
body
biffen
looked
with
some
concern
at
his
friend
so
unwonted
was
a
sally
of
this
kind
why
is
a
london
haven
t
the
least
because
the
brains
are
always
at
the
top
not
bad
i
think
eh
well
no
it
ll
pass
distinctly
professional
though
the
general
public
would
fail
to
see
the
point
i
m
afraid
but
what
has
come
to
you
good
tidings
carter
has
offered
me
a
place
which
will
be
a
decided
improvement
a
house
found
or
rooms
at
all
events
and
salary
a
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
by
plutus
that
s
good
hearing
some
duties
attached
i
suppose
i
m
afraid
that
was
inevitable
as
things
go
it
s
the
secretaryship
of
a
home
for
destitute
boys
at
croydon
the
post
is
far
from
a
sinecure
carter
assures
me
there
s
a
great
deal
of
purely
secretarial
work
and
there
s
a
great
deal
of
practical
work
some
of
it
rather
rough
i
fancy
it
seems
doubtful
whether
i
am
exactly
the
man
the
present
holder
is
a
burly
fellow
over
six
feet
high
delighting
in
gymnastics
and
rather
fond
of
a
fight
now
and
then
when
opportunity
offers
but
he
is
departing
at
christmas
going
somewhere
as
a
missionary
and
i
can
have
the
place
if
i
as
i
suppose
you
do
yes
i
shall
try
it
biffen
waited
a
little
then
asked
i
suppose
your
wife
will
go
with
you
there
s
no
reardon
tried
to
answer
indifferently
but
it
could
be
seen
that
he
was
agitated
between
hopes
and
fears
you
ll
ask
her
at
all
events
oh
yes
was
the
reply
but
surely
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
she
ll
come
a
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
without
rent
to
pay
why
that
s
affluence
the
rooms
i
might
occupy
are
in
the
home
itself
amy
won
t
take
very
readily
to
a
dwelling
of
that
kind
and
croydon
isn
t
the
most
inviting
close
to
delightful
yes
yes
but
amy
doesn
t
care
about
you
misjudge
her
reardon
you
are
too
harsh
i
implore
you
not
to
lose
the
chance
of
setting
all
right
again
if
only
you
could
be
put
into
my
position
for
a
moment
and
then
be
offered
the
companionship
of
such
a
wife
as
yours
reardon
listened
with
a
face
of
lowering
excitement
i
should
be
perfectly
within
my
rights
he
said
sternly
if
i
merely
told
her
when
i
have
taken
the
position
and
let
her
ask
me
to
take
her
back
if
she
you
have
changed
a
great
deal
this
last
year
replied
biffen
shaking
his
head
a
great
deal
i
hope
to
see
you
your
old
self
again
before
long
i
should
have
declared
it
impossible
for
you
to
become
so
rugged
go
and
see
your
wife
there
s
a
good
no
i
shall
write
to
go
and
see
her
i
beg
you
no
good
ever
came
of
between
two
people
who
have
misunderstood
each
other
go
to
westbourne
park
and
be
reasonable
be
more
than
reasonable
the
happiness
of
your
life
depends
on
what
you
do
now
be
content
to
forget
whatever
wrong
has
been
done
you
to
think
that
a
man
should
need
persuading
to
win
back
such
a
wife
in
truth
there
needed
little
persuasion
perverseness
one
of
the
forms
or
issues
of
made
him
strive
against
his
desire
and
caused
him
to
adopt
a
tone
of
acerbity
in
excess
of
what
he
felt
but
already
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
see
amy
even
if
this
excuse
had
not
presented
itself
he
must
very
soon
have
yielded
to
the
longing
for
a
sight
of
his
wife
s
face
which
day
by
day
increased
among
all
the
conflicting
passions
of
which
he
was
the
victim
a
month
or
two
ago
when
the
summer
sunshine
made
his
confinement
to
the
streets
a
daily
torture
he
convinced
himself
that
there
remained
in
him
no
trace
of
his
love
for
amy
there
were
moments
when
he
thought
of
her
with
repugnance
as
a
cold
selfish
woman
who
had
feigned
affection
when
it
seemed
her
interest
to
do
so
but
brutally
declared
her
true
self
when
there
was
no
longer
anything
to
be
hoped
from
him
that
was
the
of
misery
love
even
passion
was
still
alive
in
the
depths
of
his
being
the
animation
with
which
he
sped
to
his
friend
as
soon
as
a
new
hope
had
risen
was
the
best
proof
of
his
feeling
he
went
home
and
wrote
to
amy
i
have
a
reason
for
wishing
to
see
you
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
appoint
an
hour
on
sunday
morning
when
i
can
speak
with
you
in
private
it
must
be
understood
that
i
shall
see
no
one
she
would
receive
this
by
the
first
post
saturday
and
doubtless
would
let
him
hear
in
reply
some
time
in
the
afternoon
impatience
allowed
him
little
sleep
and
the
next
day
was
a
long
weariness
of
waiting
the
evening
he
would
have
to
spend
at
the
hospital
if
there
came
no
reply
before
the
time
of
his
leaving
home
he
knew
not
how
he
should
compel
himself
to
the
ordinary
routine
of
work
yet
the
hour
came
and
he
had
heard
nothing
he
was
tempted
to
go
at
once
to
westbourne
park
but
reason
prevailed
with
him
when
he
again
entered
the
house
having
walked
at
his
utmost
speed
from
the
city
road
the
letter
lay
waiting
for
him
it
had
been
pushed
beneath
his
door
and
when
he
struck
a
match
he
found
that
one
of
his
feet
was
upon
the
white
envelope
amy
wrote
that
she
would
be
at
home
at
eleven
morning
not
another
word
in
all
probability
she
knew
of
the
offer
that
had
been
made
to
him
mrs
carter
would
have
told
her
was
it
of
good
or
of
ill
omen
that
she
wrote
only
these
words
half
through
the
night
he
plagued
himself
with
suppositions
now
thinking
that
her
brevity
promised
a
welcome
now
that
she
wished
to
warn
him
against
expecting
anything
but
a
cold
offended
demeanour
at
seven
he
was
dressed
two
hours
and
a
half
had
to
be
killed
before
he
could
start
on
his
walk
westward
he
would
have
wandered
about
the
streets
but
it
rained
he
had
made
himself
as
decent
as
possible
in
appearance
but
he
must
necessarily
seem
an
odd
sunday
visitor
at
a
house
such
as
mrs
yule
s
his
soft
felt
hat
never
brushed
for
months
was
a
greyish
green
and
stained
round
the
band
with
perspiration
his
necktie
was
discoloured
and
worn
coat
and
waistcoat
might
pass
muster
but
of
the
trousers
the
less
said
the
better
one
of
his
boots
was
patched
and
both
were
all
but
heelless
very
well
let
her
see
him
thus
let
her
understand
what
it
meant
to
live
on
twelve
and
sixpence
a
week
though
it
was
cold
and
wet
he
could
not
put
on
his
overcoat
three
years
ago
it
had
been
a
fairly
good
ulster
at
present
the
edges
of
the
sleeves
were
frayed
two
buttons
were
missing
and
the
original
hue
of
the
cloth
was
indeterminable
at
nine
he
set
out
and
struggled
with
his
shabby
umbrella
against
wind
and
rain
down
pentonville
hill
up
euston
road
all
along
marylebone
road
then
towards
the
point
of
his
destination
it
was
a
good
six
miles
from
the
one
house
to
the
other
but
he
arrived
before
the
appointed
time
and
had
to
stray
about
until
the
cessation
of
and
the
striking
of
clocks
told
him
it
was
eleven
then
he
presented
himself
at
the
familiar
door
on
his
asking
for
mrs
reardon
he
was
at
once
admitted
and
led
up
to
the
the
servant
did
not
ask
his
name
then
he
waited
for
a
minute
or
two
feeling
himself
a
squalid
wretch
amid
the
dainty
furniture
the
door
opened
amy
in
a
simple
but
very
becoming
dress
approached
to
within
a
yard
of
him
after
the
first
glance
she
had
averted
her
eyes
and
she
did
not
offer
to
shake
hands
he
saw
that
his
muddy
and
shapeless
boots
drew
her
attention
do
you
know
why
i
have
come
he
asked
he
meant
the
tone
to
be
conciliatory
but
he
could
not
command
his
voice
and
it
sounded
rough
hostile
i
think
so
amy
answered
seating
herself
gracefully
she
would
have
spoken
with
less
dignity
but
for
that
accent
of
his
the
carters
have
told
you
yes
i
have
heard
about
there
was
no
promise
in
her
manner
she
kept
her
face
turned
away
and
reardon
saw
its
beautiful
profile
hard
and
cold
as
though
in
marble
it
doesn
t
interest
you
at
all
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
a
better
prospect
offers
for
he
did
not
sit
down
and
was
holding
his
rusty
hat
behind
his
back
you
speak
as
if
it
in
no
way
concerned
yourself
is
that
what
you
wish
me
to
understand
won
t
it
be
better
if
you
tell
me
why
you
have
come
here
as
you
are
resolved
to
find
offence
in
whatever
i
say
i
prefer
to
keep
silence
please
to
let
me
know
why
you
have
asked
to
see
reardon
turned
abruptly
as
if
to
leave
her
but
checked
himself
at
a
little
distance
both
had
come
to
this
meeting
prepared
for
a
renewal
of
amity
but
in
these
first
few
moments
each
was
so
disagreeably
impressed
by
the
look
and
language
of
the
other
that
a
revulsion
of
feeling
undid
all
the
more
hopeful
effects
of
their
long
severance
on
entering
amy
had
meant
to
offer
her
hand
but
the
unexpected
meanness
of
reardon
s
aspect
shocked
and
restrained
her
all
but
every
woman
would
have
experienced
that
shrinking
from
the
livery
of
poverty
amy
had
but
to
reflect
and
she
understood
that
her
husband
could
in
no
wise
help
this
shabbiness
when
he
parted
from
her
his
wardrobe
was
already
in
a
condition
and
how
was
he
to
have
purchased
new
garments
since
then
none
the
less
such
attire
degraded
him
in
her
eyes
it
symbolised
the
melancholy
decline
which
he
had
suffered
intellectually
on
reardon
his
wife
s
elegance
had
the
same
repellent
effect
though
this
would
not
have
been
the
case
but
for
the
expression
of
her
countenance
had
it
been
possible
for
them
to
remain
together
during
the
first
five
minutes
without
exchange
of
words
sympathies
might
have
prevailed
on
both
sides
the
first
speech
uttered
would
most
likely
have
harmonised
with
their
gentler
thoughts
but
the
mischief
was
done
so
speedily
a
man
must
indeed
be
graciously
endowed
if
his
personal
appearance
can
defy
the
disadvantage
of
cheap
modern
clothing
worn
into
shapelessness
reardon
had
no
such
remarkable
physique
and
it
was
not
wonderful
that
his
wife
felt
ashamed
of
him
strictly
ashamed
he
seemed
to
her
a
social
inferior
the
impression
was
so
strong
that
it
resisted
all
memory
of
his
spiritual
qualities
she
might
have
anticipated
this
state
of
things
and
have
armed
herself
to
encounter
it
but
somehow
she
had
not
done
so
for
more
than
five
months
she
had
been
living
among
people
who
dressed
well
the
contrast
was
too
suddenly
forced
upon
her
she
was
especially
susceptible
in
such
matters
and
had
become
none
the
less
so
under
the
demoralising
influence
of
her
misfortunes
true
she
soon
began
to
feel
ashamed
of
her
shame
but
that
could
not
annihilate
the
natural
feeling
and
its
results
i
don
t
love
him
i
can
t
love
thus
she
spoke
to
herself
with
immutable
decision
she
had
been
doubtful
till
now
but
all
doubt
was
at
an
end
had
reardon
been
practical
man
enough
to
procure
by
hook
or
by
crook
a
decent
suit
of
clothes
for
this
interview
that
ridiculous
trifle
might
have
made
all
the
difference
in
what
was
to
result
he
turned
again
and
spoke
with
the
harshness
of
a
man
who
feels
that
he
is
despised
and
is
determined
to
show
an
equal
contempt
i
came
to
ask
you
what
you
propose
to
do
in
case
i
go
to
i
have
no
proposal
to
make
that
means
then
that
you
are
content
to
go
on
living
here
if
i
have
no
choice
i
must
make
myself
but
you
have
a
none
has
yet
been
offered
then
i
offer
it
now
said
reardon
speaking
less
aggressively
i
shall
have
a
dwelling
rent
free
and
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
perhaps
it
would
be
more
in
keeping
with
my
station
if
i
say
that
i
shall
have
something
less
than
three
pounds
a
week
you
can
either
accept
from
me
half
this
money
as
up
to
now
or
come
and
take
your
place
again
as
my
wife
please
to
decide
what
you
will
i
will
let
you
know
by
letter
in
a
few
it
seemed
impossible
to
her
to
say
she
would
return
yet
a
refusal
to
do
so
involved
nothing
less
than
separation
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
postponement
of
decision
was
her
only
resource
i
must
know
at
once
said
reardon
i
can
t
answer
at
if
you
don
t
i
shall
understand
you
to
mean
that
you
refuse
to
come
to
me
you
know
the
circumstances
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
consult
with
anyone
else
you
can
answer
me
immediately
if
you
i
don
t
wish
to
answer
you
immediately
amy
replied
paling
slightly
then
that
decides
it
when
i
leave
you
we
are
strangers
to
each
amy
made
a
rapid
study
of
his
countenance
she
had
never
entertained
for
a
moment
the
supposition
that
his
wits
were
unsettled
but
none
the
less
the
constant
recurrence
of
that
idea
in
her
mother
s
talk
had
subtly
influenced
her
against
her
husband
it
had
confirmed
her
in
thinking
that
his
behaviour
was
inexcusable
and
now
it
seemed
to
her
that
anyone
might
be
justified
in
holding
him
demented
so
reckless
was
his
utterance
it
was
difficult
to
know
him
as
the
man
who
had
loved
her
so
devotedly
who
was
incapable
of
an
unkind
word
or
look
if
that
is
what
you
prefer
she
said
there
must
be
a
formal
separation
i
can
t
trust
my
future
to
your
you
mean
it
must
be
put
into
the
hands
of
a
lawyer
yes
i
that
will
be
the
best
no
very
well
i
will
speak
with
my
friends
about
your
friends
he
exclaimed
bitterly
but
for
those
friends
of
yours
this
would
never
have
happened
i
wish
you
had
been
alone
in
the
world
and
a
kind
wish
all
things
yes
it
is
a
kind
wish
then
your
marriage
with
me
would
have
been
binding
you
would
have
known
that
my
lot
was
yours
and
the
knowledge
would
have
helped
your
weakness
i
begin
to
see
how
much
right
there
is
on
the
side
of
those
people
who
would
keep
women
in
subjection
you
have
been
allowed
to
act
with
independence
and
the
result
is
that
you
have
ruined
my
life
and
debased
your
own
if
i
had
been
strong
enough
to
treat
you
as
a
child
and
bid
you
follow
me
wherever
my
own
fortunes
led
it
would
have
been
as
much
better
for
you
as
for
me
i
was
weak
and
i
suffer
as
all
weak
people
you
think
it
was
my
duty
to
share
such
a
home
as
you
have
at
present
you
know
it
was
and
if
the
choice
had
lain
between
that
and
earning
your
own
livelihood
you
would
have
thought
that
even
such
a
poor
home
might
be
made
tolerable
there
were
possibilities
in
you
of
better
things
than
will
ever
come
out
there
followed
a
silence
amy
sat
with
her
eyes
gloomily
fixed
on
the
carpet
reardon
looked
about
the
room
but
saw
nothing
he
had
thrown
his
hat
into
a
chair
and
his
fingers
worked
nervously
together
behind
his
back
will
you
tell
me
he
said
at
length
how
your
position
is
regarded
by
these
friends
of
yours
i
don
t
mean
your
mother
and
brother
but
the
people
who
come
to
this
i
have
not
asked
such
people
for
their
still
i
suppose
some
sort
of
explanation
has
been
necessary
in
your
intercourse
with
them
how
have
you
represented
your
relations
with
me
i
can
t
see
that
that
concerns
in
a
manner
it
does
certainly
it
matters
very
little
to
me
how
i
am
thought
of
by
people
of
this
kind
but
one
doesn
t
like
to
be
reviled
without
cause
have
you
allowed
it
to
be
supposed
that
i
have
made
life
with
me
intolerable
for
you
no
i
have
not
you
insult
me
by
asking
the
question
but
as
you
don
t
seem
to
understand
feelings
of
that
kind
i
may
as
well
answer
you
then
have
you
told
them
the
truth
that
i
became
so
poor
you
couldn
t
live
with
me
i
have
never
said
that
in
so
many
words
but
no
doubt
it
is
understood
it
must
be
known
also
that
you
refused
to
take
the
step
which
might
have
helped
you
out
of
your
what
step
she
reminded
him
of
his
intention
to
spend
half
a
year
in
working
at
the
seaside
i
had
utterly
forgotten
it
he
returned
with
a
mocking
laugh
that
shows
how
ridiculous
such
a
thing
would
have
you
are
doing
no
literary
work
at
all
amy
asked
do
you
imagine
that
i
have
the
peace
of
mind
necessary
for
anything
of
that
sort
this
was
in
a
changed
voice
it
reminded
her
so
strongly
of
her
husband
before
his
disasters
that
she
could
not
frame
a
reply
do
you
think
i
am
able
to
occupy
myself
with
the
affairs
of
imaginary
people
i
didn
t
necessarily
mean
that
i
can
forget
myself
then
in
the
study
of
literature
i
wonder
whether
you
really
think
of
me
like
that
how
in
heaven
s
name
do
you
suppose
i
spend
my
leisure
time
she
made
no
answer
do
you
think
i
take
this
calamity
as
as
you
do
amy
i
am
far
from
taking
it
yet
you
are
in
good
health
i
see
no
sign
that
you
have
she
kept
silence
her
suffering
had
been
slight
enough
and
chiefly
due
to
considerations
of
social
propriety
but
she
would
not
avow
this
and
did
not
like
to
make
admission
of
it
to
herself
before
her
friends
she
frequently
affected
to
conceal
a
profound
sorrow
but
so
long
as
her
child
was
left
to
her
she
was
in
no
danger
of
falling
a
victim
to
sentimental
troubles
and
certainly
i
can
t
believe
it
he
continued
now
you
declare
your
wish
to
be
formally
separated
from
i
have
declared
no
such
indeed
you
have
if
you
can
hesitate
a
moment
about
returning
to
me
when
difficulties
are
at
an
end
that
tells
me
you
would
prefer
final
i
hesitate
for
this
reason
amy
said
after
reflecting
you
are
so
very
greatly
changed
from
what
you
used
to
be
that
i
think
it
doubtful
if
i
could
live
with
changed
yes
that
is
true
i
am
afraid
but
how
do
you
think
this
change
will
affect
my
behaviour
to
you
remember
how
you
have
been
speaking
to
and
you
think
i
should
treat
you
brutally
if
you
came
into
my
power
not
brutally
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
but
with
faults
of
temper
which
i
couldn
t
bear
i
have
my
own
faults
i
can
t
behave
as
meekly
as
some
women
it
was
a
small
concession
but
reardon
made
much
of
it
did
my
faults
of
temper
give
you
any
trouble
during
the
first
year
of
our
married
life
he
asked
gently
no
she
admitted
they
began
to
afflict
you
when
i
was
so
hard
driven
by
difficulties
that
i
needed
all
your
sympathy
all
your
forbearance
did
i
receive
much
of
either
from
you
amy
i
think
you
did
until
you
demanded
impossible
things
of
it
was
always
in
your
power
to
rule
me
what
pained
me
worst
and
hardened
me
against
you
was
that
i
saw
you
didn
t
care
to
exert
your
influence
there
was
never
a
time
when
i
could
have
resisted
a
word
of
yours
spoken
out
of
your
love
for
me
but
even
then
i
am
afraid
you
no
longer
loved
me
and
now
he
broke
off
and
stood
watching
her
face
have
you
any
love
for
me
left
burst
from
his
lips
as
if
the
words
all
but
choked
him
in
the
utterance
amy
tried
to
shape
some
evasive
answer
but
could
say
nothing
is
there
ever
so
small
a
hope
that
i
might
win
some
love
from
you
again
if
you
wish
me
to
come
and
live
with
you
when
you
go
to
croydon
i
will
do
but
that
is
not
answering
me
it
s
all
i
can
then
you
mean
that
you
would
sacrifice
yourself
out
of
what
out
of
pity
for
me
let
us
do
you
wish
to
see
willie
asked
amy
instead
of
replying
no
it
is
you
i
have
come
to
see
the
child
is
nothing
to
me
compared
with
you
it
is
you
who
loved
me
who
became
my
wife
you
only
i
care
about
tell
me
you
will
try
to
be
as
you
used
to
be
give
me
only
that
hope
amy
i
will
ask
nothing
except
that
i
can
t
say
anything
except
that
i
will
come
to
croydon
if
you
wish
and
reproach
me
always
because
you
have
to
live
in
such
a
place
away
from
your
friends
without
a
hope
of
the
social
success
which
was
your
dearest
ambition
her
practical
denial
that
she
loved
him
wrung
this
taunt
from
his
anguished
heart
he
repented
the
words
as
soon
as
they
were
spoken
what
is
the
good
exclaimed
amy
in
irritation
rising
and
moving
away
from
him
how
can
i
pretend
that
i
look
forward
to
such
a
life
with
any
hope
he
stood
in
mute
misery
inwardly
cursing
himself
and
his
fate
i
have
said
i
will
come
she
continued
her
voice
shaken
with
nervous
tension
ask
me
or
not
as
you
please
when
you
are
ready
to
go
there
i
can
t
talk
about
i
shall
not
ask
you
he
replied
i
will
have
no
woman
slave
dragging
out
a
weary
life
with
me
either
you
are
my
willing
wife
or
you
are
nothing
to
i
am
married
to
you
and
that
can
t
be
undone
i
repeat
that
i
shan
t
refuse
to
obey
you
i
shall
say
no
she
moved
to
a
distance
and
there
seated
herself
half
turned
from
him
i
shall
never
ask
you
to
come
said
reardon
breaking
a
short
silence
if
our
married
life
is
ever
to
begin
again
it
must
be
of
your
seeking
come
to
me
of
your
own
will
and
i
shall
never
reject
you
but
i
will
die
in
utter
loneliness
rather
than
ask
you
he
lingered
a
few
moments
watching
her
she
did
not
move
then
he
took
his
hat
went
in
silence
from
the
room
and
left
the
house
it
rained
harder
than
before
as
no
trains
were
running
at
this
hour
he
walked
in
the
direction
where
he
would
be
likely
to
meet
with
an
omnibus
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
one
passed
which
was
any
use
to
him
when
he
reached
home
he
was
in
cheerless
plight
enough
to
make
things
pleasanter
one
of
his
boots
had
let
in
water
abundantly
the
first
sore
throat
of
the
season
no
doubt
he
muttered
to
himself
nor
was
he
disappointed
by
tuesday
the
cold
had
firm
grip
of
him
a
day
or
two
of
influenza
or
sore
throat
always
made
him
so
weak
that
with
difficulty
he
supported
the
least
physical
exertion
but
at
present
he
must
go
to
his
work
at
the
hospital
why
stay
at
home
to
what
purpose
spare
himself
it
was
not
as
if
life
had
any
promise
for
him
he
was
a
machine
for
earning
so
much
money
a
week
and
would
at
least
give
faithful
work
for
his
wages
until
the
day
of
final
breakdown
but
midway
in
the
week
carter
discovered
how
ill
his
clerk
was
you
ought
to
be
in
bed
my
dear
fellow
with
gruel
and
mustard
plasters
and
all
the
rest
of
it
go
home
and
take
care
of
yourself
i
insist
upon
before
leaving
the
office
reardon
wrote
a
few
lines
to
biffen
whom
he
had
visited
on
the
monday
come
and
see
me
if
you
can
i
am
down
with
a
bad
cold
and
have
to
keep
in
for
the
rest
of
the
week
all
the
same
i
feel
far
more
cheerful
bring
a
new
chapter
of
your
exhilarating
chapter
xxvi
married
woman
s
property
on
her
return
from
church
that
sunday
mrs
edmund
yule
was
anxious
to
learn
the
result
of
the
meeting
between
amy
and
her
husband
she
hoped
fervently
that
amy
s
anomalous
position
would
come
to
an
end
now
that
reardon
had
the
offer
of
something
better
than
a
mere
clerkship
john
yule
never
ceased
to
grumble
at
his
sister
s
permanence
in
the
house
especially
since
he
had
learnt
that
the
money
sent
by
reardon
each
month
was
not
made
use
of
why
it
should
not
be
applied
for
household
expenses
passed
his
understanding
it
seems
to
me
he
remarked
several
times
that
the
fellow
only
does
his
bare
duty
in
sending
it
what
is
it
to
anyone
else
whether
he
lives
on
twelve
shillings
a
week
or
twelve
pence
it
is
his
business
to
support
his
wife
if
he
can
t
do
that
to
contribute
as
much
to
her
support
as
possible
amy
s
scruples
are
all
very
fine
if
she
could
afford
them
it
s
very
nice
to
pay
for
your
delicacies
of
feeling
out
of
other
people
s
there
ll
have
to
be
a
formal
separation
was
the
startling
announcement
with
which
amy
answered
her
mother
s
inquiry
as
to
what
had
passed
a
separation
but
my
dear
mrs
yule
could
not
express
her
disappointment
and
dismay
we
couldn
t
live
together
it
s
no
use
but
at
your
age
amy
how
can
you
think
of
anything
so
shocking
and
then
you
know
it
will
be
impossible
for
him
to
make
you
a
sufficient
i
shall
have
to
live
as
well
as
i
can
on
the
pounds
a
year
if
you
can
t
afford
to
let
me
stay
with
you
for
that
i
must
go
into
cheap
lodgings
in
the
country
like
poor
mrs
butcher
this
was
wild
talking
for
amy
the
interview
had
upset
her
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
she
kept
apart
in
her
own
room
on
the
morrow
mrs
yule
succeeded
in
eliciting
a
clear
account
of
the
conversation
which
had
ended
so
hopelessly
i
would
rather
spend
the
rest
of
my
days
in
the
workhouse
than
beg
him
to
take
me
back
was
amy
s
final
comment
uttered
with
the
earnestness
which
her
mother
understood
but
too
well
but
you
are
willing
to
go
back
dear
i
told
him
then
you
must
leave
this
to
me
the
carters
will
let
us
know
how
things
go
on
and
when
it
seems
to
be
time
i
must
see
edwin
i
can
t
allow
that
anything
you
could
say
on
your
own
account
would
be
useless
and
there
is
nothing
to
say
from
mrs
yule
kept
her
own
counsel
she
had
a
full
month
before
her
during
which
to
consider
the
situation
but
it
was
clear
to
her
that
these
young
people
must
be
brought
together
again
her
estimate
of
reardon
s
mental
condition
had
undergone
a
sudden
change
from
the
moment
when
she
heard
that
a
respectable
post
was
within
his
reach
she
decided
that
he
was
strange
but
then
all
men
of
literary
talent
had
marked
singularities
and
doubtless
she
had
been
too
hasty
in
interpreting
the
peculiar
features
natural
to
a
character
such
as
his
a
few
days
later
arrived
the
news
of
their
relative
s
death
at
wattleborough
this
threw
mrs
yule
into
a
commotion
at
first
she
decided
to
accompany
her
son
and
be
present
at
the
funeral
after
changing
her
mind
twenty
times
she
determined
not
to
go
john
must
send
or
bring
back
the
news
as
soon
as
possible
that
it
would
be
of
a
nature
sensibly
to
affect
her
own
position
if
not
that
of
her
children
she
had
little
doubt
her
husband
had
been
the
favourite
brother
of
the
deceased
and
on
that
account
there
was
no
saying
how
handsome
a
legacy
she
might
receive
she
dreamt
of
houses
in
south
kensington
of
social
ambitions
gratified
even
thus
late
on
the
morning
after
the
funeral
came
a
postcard
announcing
john
s
return
by
a
certain
train
but
no
scrap
of
news
was
added
just
like
that
irritating
boy
we
must
go
to
the
station
to
meet
him
you
ll
come
won
t
you
amy
amy
readily
consented
for
she
too
had
hopes
though
circumstances
blurred
them
mother
and
daughter
were
walking
about
the
platform
half
an
hour
before
the
train
was
due
their
agitation
would
have
been
manifest
to
anyone
observing
them
when
at
length
the
train
rolled
in
and
john
was
discovered
they
pressed
eagerly
upon
him
don
t
you
excite
yourself
he
said
gruffly
to
his
mother
there
s
no
reason
mrs
yule
glanced
in
dismay
at
amy
they
followed
john
to
a
cab
and
took
places
with
him
now
don
t
be
provoking
jack
just
tell
us
at
by
all
means
you
haven
t
a
i
haven
t
you
are
joking
ridiculous
boy
never
felt
less
disposed
to
i
assure
after
staring
out
of
the
window
for
a
minute
or
two
he
at
length
informed
amy
of
the
extent
to
which
she
profited
by
her
uncle
s
decease
then
made
known
what
was
bequeathed
to
himself
his
temper
grew
worse
every
moment
and
he
replied
savagely
to
each
successive
question
concerning
the
other
items
of
the
will
what
have
you
to
grumble
about
asked
amy
whose
face
was
exultant
notwithstanding
the
drawbacks
attaching
to
her
good
fortune
if
uncle
alfred
receives
nothing
at
all
and
mother
has
nothing
you
ought
to
think
yourself
very
it
s
very
easy
for
you
to
say
that
with
your
ten
but
is
it
her
own
asked
mrs
yule
is
it
for
her
separate
use
of
course
it
is
she
gets
the
benefit
of
last
year
s
married
woman
s
property
act
the
will
was
executed
in
january
this
year
and
i
dare
say
the
old
curmudgeon
destroyed
a
former
one
what
a
splendid
act
of
parliament
that
is
cried
amy
the
only
one
worth
anything
that
i
ever
heard
but
my
dear
began
her
mother
in
a
tone
of
protest
however
she
reserved
her
comment
for
a
more
fitting
time
and
place
and
merely
said
i
wonder
whether
he
had
heard
what
has
been
going
on
do
you
think
he
would
have
altered
his
will
if
he
had
asked
amy
with
a
smile
of
security
why
the
deuce
he
should
have
left
you
so
much
in
any
case
is
more
than
i
can
understand
growled
her
brother
what
s
the
use
to
me
of
a
paltry
thousand
or
two
it
isn
t
enough
to
invest
isn
t
enough
to
do
anything
you
may
depend
upon
it
your
cousin
marian
thinks
her
five
thousand
good
for
something
said
mrs
yule
who
was
at
the
funeral
don
t
be
so
surly
jack
tell
us
all
about
it
i
m
sure
if
anyone
has
cause
to
be
it
s
poor
thus
they
talked
amid
the
rattle
of
the
by
when
they
reached
home
silence
had
fallen
upon
them
and
each
one
was
sufficiently
occupied
with
private
thoughts
mrs
yule
s
servants
had
a
terrible
time
of
it
for
the
next
few
days
too
affectionate
to
turn
her
against
john
and
amy
she
relieved
herself
by
severity
to
the
domestic
slaves
as
an
english
matron
is
of
course
justified
in
doing
her
daughter
s
position
caused
her
even
more
concern
than
before
she
constantly
lamented
to
herself
oh
why
didn
t
he
die
before
she
was
married
in
which
case
amy
would
never
have
dreamt
of
wedding
a
penniless
author
amy
declined
to
discuss
the
new
aspect
of
things
until
hours
after
john
s
return
then
she
said
i
shall
do
nothing
whatever
until
the
money
is
paid
to
me
and
what
i
shall
do
then
i
don
t
you
are
sure
to
hear
from
edwin
opined
mrs
yule
i
think
not
he
isn
t
the
kind
of
man
to
behave
in
that
then
i
suppose
you
are
bound
to
take
the
first
step
that
i
shall
never
she
said
so
but
the
sudden
happiness
of
finding
herself
wealthy
was
not
without
its
softening
effect
on
amy
s
feelings
generous
impulses
alternated
with
moods
of
discontent
the
thought
of
her
husband
in
his
squalid
lodgings
tempted
her
to
forget
injuries
and
disillusions
and
to
play
the
part
of
a
generous
wife
it
would
be
possible
now
for
them
to
go
abroad
and
spend
a
year
or
two
in
healthful
travel
the
result
in
reardon
s
case
might
be
wonderful
he
might
recover
all
the
energy
of
his
imagination
and
resume
his
literary
career
from
the
point
he
had
reached
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
on
the
other
hand
was
it
not
more
likely
that
he
would
lapse
into
a
life
of
scholarly
such
as
he
had
often
told
her
was
his
ideal
in
that
event
what
tedium
and
regret
lay
before
her
ten
thousand
pounds
sounded
well
but
what
did
it
represent
in
reality
a
poor
four
hundred
a
year
perhaps
mere
decency
of
obscure
existence
unless
her
husband
could
glorify
it
by
winning
fame
if
he
did
nothing
she
would
be
the
wife
of
a
man
who
had
failed
in
literature
she
would
not
be
able
to
take
a
place
in
society
life
would
be
supported
without
struggle
nothing
more
to
be
hoped
this
view
of
the
future
possessed
her
strongly
when
on
the
second
day
she
went
to
communicate
her
news
to
mrs
carter
this
amiable
lady
had
now
become
what
she
always
desired
to
be
amy
s
intimate
friend
they
saw
each
other
very
frequently
and
conversed
of
most
things
with
much
frankness
it
was
between
eleven
and
twelve
in
the
morning
when
amy
paid
her
visit
and
she
found
mrs
carter
on
the
point
of
going
out
i
was
coming
to
see
you
cried
edith
why
haven
t
you
let
me
know
of
what
has
happened
you
have
heard
i
suppose
albert
heard
from
your
i
supposed
he
would
and
i
haven
t
felt
in
the
mood
for
talking
about
it
even
with
they
went
into
mrs
carter
s
boudoir
a
tiny
room
full
of
such
pretty
things
as
can
be
purchased
nowadays
by
anyone
who
has
a
few
shillings
to
spare
and
tolerable
taste
either
of
their
own
or
at
had
she
been
left
to
her
instincts
edith
would
have
surrounded
herself
with
objects
representing
a
much
earlier
stage
of
artistic
development
but
she
was
quick
to
imitate
what
fashion
declared
becoming
her
husband
regarded
her
as
a
remarkable
authority
in
all
matters
of
personal
or
domestic
ornamentation
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
inquired
examining
amy
from
head
to
foot
as
if
she
thought
that
the
inheritance
of
so
substantial
a
sum
must
have
produced
visible
changes
in
her
friend
i
am
going
to
do
but
surely
you
re
not
in
low
spirits
what
have
i
to
rejoice
about
they
talked
for
a
while
before
amy
brought
herself
to
utter
what
she
was
thinking
isn
t
it
a
most
ridiculous
thing
that
married
people
who
both
wish
to
separate
can
t
do
so
and
be
quite
free
again
i
suppose
it
would
lead
to
all
sorts
of
troubles
don
t
you
think
so
people
say
about
every
new
step
in
civilisation
what
would
have
been
thought
twenty
years
ago
of
a
proposal
to
make
all
married
women
independent
of
their
husbands
in
money
matters
all
sorts
of
absurd
dangers
were
foreseen
no
doubt
and
it
s
the
same
now
about
divorce
in
america
people
can
get
divorced
if
they
don
t
suit
each
other
at
all
events
in
some
of
the
states
and
does
any
harm
come
of
it
just
the
opposite
i
should
edith
mused
such
speculations
were
daring
but
she
had
grown
accustomed
to
think
of
amy
as
an
advanced
woman
and
liked
to
imitate
her
in
this
respect
it
does
seem
reasonable
she
murmured
the
law
ought
to
encourage
such
separations
instead
of
forbidding
them
amy
pursued
if
a
husband
and
wife
find
that
they
have
made
a
mistake
what
useless
cruelty
it
is
to
condemn
them
to
suffer
the
consequences
for
the
whole
of
their
lives
i
suppose
it
s
to
make
people
careful
said
edith
with
a
laugh
if
so
we
know
that
it
has
always
failed
and
always
will
fail
so
the
sooner
such
a
profitless
law
is
altered
the
better
isn
t
there
some
society
for
getting
that
kind
of
reform
i
would
subscribe
fifty
pounds
a
year
to
help
it
wouldn
t
you
yes
if
i
had
it
to
spare
replied
the
other
then
they
both
laughed
but
edith
the
more
naturally
not
on
my
own
account
you
know
she
added
it
s
because
women
who
are
happily
married
can
t
and
won
t
understand
the
position
of
those
who
are
not
that
there
s
so
much
difficulty
in
reforming
marriage
but
i
understand
you
amy
and
i
grieve
about
you
what
you
are
to
do
i
can
t
oh
it
s
easy
to
see
what
i
shall
do
of
course
i
have
no
choice
really
and
i
ought
to
have
a
choice
that
s
the
hardship
and
the
wrong
of
it
perhaps
if
i
had
i
should
find
a
sort
of
pleasure
in
sacrificing
there
were
some
new
novels
on
the
table
amy
took
up
a
volume
presently
and
glanced
over
a
page
or
two
i
don
t
know
how
you
can
go
on
reading
that
sort
of
stuff
book
after
book
she
exclaimed
oh
but
people
say
this
last
novel
of
markland
s
is
one
of
his
best
or
worst
novels
are
all
the
same
nothing
but
love
love
love
what
silly
nonsense
it
is
why
don
t
people
write
about
the
really
important
things
of
life
some
of
the
french
novelists
do
several
of
balzac
s
for
instance
i
have
just
been
reading
his
cousin
pons
a
terrible
book
but
i
enjoyed
it
ever
so
much
because
it
was
nothing
like
a
love
story
what
rubbish
is
printed
about
love
i
get
rather
tired
of
it
sometimes
admitted
edith
with
amusement
i
should
hope
you
do
indeed
what
downright
lies
are
accepted
as
indisputable
that
about
love
being
a
woman
s
whole
life
who
believes
it
really
love
is
the
most
insignificant
thing
in
most
women
s
lives
it
occupies
a
few
months
possibly
a
year
or
two
and
even
then
i
doubt
if
it
is
often
the
first
edith
held
her
head
aside
and
pondered
smilingly
i
m
sure
there
s
a
great
opportunity
for
some
clever
novelist
who
will
never
write
about
love
at
but
then
it
does
come
into
yes
for
a
month
or
two
as
i
say
think
of
the
biographies
of
men
and
women
how
many
pages
are
devoted
to
their
love
affairs
compare
those
books
with
novels
which
profess
to
be
biographies
and
you
see
how
false
such
pictures
are
think
of
the
very
words
novel
romance
what
do
they
mean
but
exaggeration
of
one
bit
of
life
that
may
be
true
but
why
do
people
find
the
subject
so
interesting
because
there
is
so
little
love
in
real
life
that
s
the
truth
of
it
why
do
poor
people
care
only
for
stories
about
the
rich
the
same
how
clever
you
are
amy
am
i
it
s
very
nice
to
be
told
so
perhaps
i
have
some
cleverness
of
a
kind
but
what
use
is
it
to
me
my
life
is
being
wasted
i
ought
to
have
a
place
in
the
society
of
clever
people
i
was
never
meant
to
live
quietly
in
the
background
oh
if
i
hadn
t
been
in
such
a
hurry
and
so
inexperienced
oh
i
wanted
to
ask
you
said
edith
soon
after
this
do
you
wish
albert
to
say
anything
about
you
at
the
hospital
there
s
no
reason
why
he
shouldn
you
won
t
even
write
to
say
i
shall
do
since
the
parting
from
her
husband
there
had
proceeded
in
amy
a
noticeable
maturing
of
intellect
probably
the
one
thing
was
a
consequence
of
the
other
during
that
last
year
in
the
flat
her
mind
was
held
captive
by
material
cares
and
this
arrest
of
her
natural
development
doubtless
had
much
to
do
with
the
appearance
of
acerbity
in
a
character
which
had
displayed
so
much
sweetness
so
much
womanly
grace
moreover
it
was
arrest
at
a
critical
point
when
she
fell
in
love
with
edwin
reardon
her
mind
had
still
to
undergo
the
culture
of
circumstances
though
a
woman
in
years
she
had
seen
nothing
of
life
but
a
few
phases
of
artificial
society
and
her
education
had
not
progressed
beyond
the
final
schoolgirl
stage
submitting
herself
to
reardon
s
influence
she
passed
through
what
was
a
highly
useful
training
of
the
intellect
but
with
the
result
that
she
became
clearly
conscious
of
the
divergence
between
herself
and
her
husband
in
endeavouring
to
imbue
her
with
his
own
literary
tastes
reardon
instructed
amy
as
to
the
natural
tendencies
of
her
mind
which
till
then
she
had
not
clearly
understood
when
she
ceased
to
read
with
the
eyes
of
passion
most
of
the
things
which
were
reardon
s
supreme
interests
lost
their
value
for
her
a
sound
intelligence
enabled
her
to
think
and
feel
in
many
directions
but
the
special
line
of
her
growth
lay
apart
from
that
in
which
the
novelist
and
classical
scholar
had
directed
her
when
she
found
herself
alone
and
independent
her
mind
acted
like
a
spring
when
pressure
is
removed
after
a
few
weeks
of
desoeuvrement
she
obeyed
the
impulse
to
occupy
herself
with
a
kind
of
reading
alien
to
reardon
s
sympathies
the
solid
periodicals
attracted
her
and
especially
those
articles
which
dealt
with
themes
of
social
science
anything
that
savoured
of
newness
and
boldness
in
philosophic
thought
had
a
charm
for
her
palate
she
read
a
good
deal
of
that
kind
of
literature
which
may
be
defined
as
specialism
popularised
writing
which
addresses
itself
to
educated
but
not
strictly
studious
persons
and
which
forms
the
reservoir
of
conversation
for
society
above
the
sphere
of
turf
and
thus
for
instance
though
she
could
not
undertake
the
volumes
of
herbert
spencer
she
was
intelligently
acquainted
with
the
tenor
of
their
contents
and
though
she
had
never
opened
one
of
darwin
s
books
her
knowledge
of
his
main
theories
and
illustrations
was
respectable
she
was
becoming
a
typical
woman
of
the
new
time
the
woman
who
has
developed
concurrently
with
journalistic
enterprise
not
many
days
after
that
conversation
with
edith
carter
she
had
occasion
to
visit
mudie
s
for
the
new
number
of
some
periodical
which
contained
an
appetising
title
as
it
was
a
sunny
and
warm
day
she
walked
to
new
oxford
street
from
the
nearest
metropolitan
station
whilst
waiting
at
the
library
counter
she
heard
a
familiar
voice
in
her
proximity
it
was
that
of
jasper
milvain
who
stood
talking
with
a
lady
as
amy
turned
to
look
at
him
his
eye
met
hers
clearly
he
had
been
aware
of
her
the
review
she
desired
was
handed
to
her
she
moved
aside
and
turned
over
the
pages
then
milvain
walked
up
he
was
armed
in
the
fashions
of
suave
society
no
bohemianism
of
garb
or
person
for
jasper
knew
he
could
not
afford
that
kind
of
economy
on
her
part
amy
was
much
better
dressed
than
usual
a
costume
suited
to
her
position
of
bereaved
heiress
what
a
time
since
we
met
said
jasper
taking
her
delicately
gloved
hand
and
looking
into
her
face
with
his
most
effective
smile
and
why
asked
amy
indeed
i
hardly
know
i
hope
mrs
yule
is
well
quite
thank
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
draw
back
to
let
her
pass
and
so
make
an
end
of
the
colloquy
but
amy
though
she
moved
forward
added
a
remark
i
don
t
see
your
name
in
any
of
this
month
s
i
have
nothing
signed
this
month
a
short
review
in
the
current
that
s
but
i
suppose
you
write
as
much
as
ever
yes
but
chiefly
in
weekly
papers
just
now
you
don
t
see
the
oh
yes
and
i
think
i
can
generally
recognise
your
they
issued
from
the
library
which
way
are
you
going
jasper
inquired
with
something
more
of
the
old
freedom
i
walked
from
gower
street
station
and
i
think
as
it
s
so
fine
i
shall
walk
back
he
accompanied
her
they
turned
up
museum
street
and
amy
after
a
short
silence
made
inquiry
concerning
his
sisters
i
am
sorry
i
saw
them
only
once
but
no
doubt
you
thought
it
better
to
let
the
acquaintance
end
i
really
didn
t
think
of
it
in
that
way
at
all
jasper
replied
we
naturally
understood
it
so
when
you
even
ceased
to
call
but
don
t
you
feel
that
there
would
have
been
a
good
deal
of
awkwardness
in
my
coming
to
mrs
yule
s
seeing
that
you
looked
at
things
from
my
husband
s
point
of
view
oh
that
s
a
mistake
i
have
only
seen
your
husband
once
since
he
went
to
amy
gave
him
a
look
of
surprise
you
are
not
on
friendly
terms
with
him
well
we
have
drifted
apart
for
some
reason
he
seemed
to
think
that
my
companionship
was
not
very
profitable
so
it
was
better
on
the
whole
that
i
should
see
neither
you
nor
amy
was
wondering
whether
he
had
heard
of
her
legacy
he
might
have
been
informed
by
a
wattleborough
correspondent
even
if
no
one
in
london
had
told
him
do
your
sisters
keep
up
their
friendship
with
my
cousin
marian
she
asked
quitting
the
previous
difficult
topic
oh
yes
he
smiled
they
see
a
great
deal
of
each
then
of
course
you
have
heard
of
my
uncle
s
death
yes
i
hope
all
your
difficulties
are
now
at
an
amy
delayed
a
moment
then
said
i
hope
so
without
any
emphasis
do
you
think
of
spending
this
winter
abroad
it
was
the
nearest
he
could
come
to
a
question
concerning
the
future
of
amy
and
her
husband
everything
is
still
quite
uncertain
but
tell
me
something
about
our
old
acquaintances
how
does
mr
biffen
get
on
i
scarcely
ever
see
him
but
i
think
he
pegs
away
at
an
interminable
novel
which
no
one
will
publish
when
it
s
done
whelpdale
i
meet
he
talked
of
the
latter
s
projects
and
achievements
in
a
lively
strain
your
own
prospects
continue
to
brighten
no
doubt
said
amy
i
really
think
they
do
things
go
fairly
well
and
i
have
lately
received
a
promise
of
very
valuable
from
whom
a
relative
of
amy
turned
to
interrogate
him
with
a
look
a
relative
you
mean
yes
they
were
passing
bedford
square
amy
glanced
at
the
trees
now
almost
bare
of
foliage
then
her
eyes
met
jasper
s
and
she
smiled
significantly
i
should
have
thought
your
aim
would
have
been
far
more
ambitious
she
said
with
distinct
utterance
marian
and
i
have
been
engaged
for
some
time
indeed
i
remember
now
how
you
once
spoke
of
her
and
you
will
be
married
soon
probably
before
the
end
of
the
year
i
see
that
you
are
criticising
my
motives
i
am
quite
prepared
for
that
in
everyone
who
knows
me
and
the
circumstances
but
you
must
remember
that
i
couldn
t
foresee
anything
of
this
kind
it
enables
us
to
marry
sooner
that
s
i
am
sure
your
motives
are
unassailable
replied
amy
still
with
a
smile
i
imagined
that
you
wouldn
t
marry
for
years
and
then
some
distinguished
person
this
throws
new
light
upon
your
you
thought
me
so
desperately
scheming
and
oh
dear
no
but
well
to
be
sure
i
can
t
say
that
i
know
marian
i
haven
t
seen
her
for
years
and
years
she
may
be
admirably
suited
to
depend
upon
it
i
think
she
s
likely
to
shine
in
society
she
is
a
brilliant
girl
full
of
tact
and
insight
scarcely
all
that
he
looked
dubiously
at
his
companion
then
you
have
abandoned
your
old
ambitions
amy
pursued
not
a
bit
of
it
i
am
on
the
way
to
achieve
and
marian
is
the
ideal
wife
to
assist
you
from
one
point
of
view
yes
pray
why
all
this
ironic
questioning
not
ironic
at
it
sounded
very
much
like
it
and
i
know
from
of
old
that
you
have
a
tendency
that
the
news
surprised
me
a
little
i
confess
but
i
see
that
i
am
in
danger
of
offending
let
us
wait
another
five
years
and
then
i
will
ask
your
opinion
as
to
the
success
of
my
marriage
i
don
t
take
a
step
of
this
kind
without
maturely
considering
it
have
i
made
many
blunders
as
yet
as
yet
not
that
i
know
do
i
impress
you
as
one
likely
to
commit
follies
i
had
rather
wait
a
little
before
answering
that
is
to
say
you
prefer
to
prophesy
after
the
event
very
well
we
shall
in
the
length
of
gower
street
they
talked
of
several
other
things
less
personal
by
degrees
the
tone
of
their
conversation
had
become
what
it
was
used
to
be
now
and
then
almost
confidential
you
are
still
at
the
same
lodgings
asked
amy
as
they
drew
near
to
the
railway
station
i
moved
yesterday
so
that
the
girls
and
i
could
be
under
the
same
roof
until
the
next
you
will
let
us
know
when
that
takes
place
he
promised
and
with
exchange
of
smiles
which
were
something
like
a
challenge
they
took
leave
of
each
other
chapter
xxvii
the
lonely
man
a
touch
of
congestion
in
the
right
lung
was
a
warning
to
reardon
that
his
of
insufficient
food
and
general
waste
of
strength
would
make
the
coming
winter
a
hard
time
for
him
worse
probably
than
the
last
biffen
responding
in
person
to
the
summons
found
him
in
bed
waited
upon
by
a
gaunt
dry
sententious
woman
of
sixty
not
the
landlady
but
a
lodger
who
was
glad
to
earn
one
meal
a
day
by
any
means
that
offered
it
wouldn
t
be
very
nice
to
die
here
would
it
said
the
sufferer
with
a
laugh
which
was
cut
short
by
a
cough
one
would
like
a
comfortable
room
at
least
why
i
don
t
know
i
dreamt
last
night
that
i
was
in
a
ship
that
had
struck
something
and
was
going
down
and
it
wasn
t
the
thought
of
death
that
most
disturbed
me
but
a
horror
of
being
plunged
in
the
icy
water
in
fact
i
have
had
just
the
same
feeling
on
shipboard
i
remember
waking
up
midway
between
corfu
and
brindisi
on
that
shaky
tub
of
a
greek
boat
we
were
rolling
a
good
deal
and
i
heard
a
sort
of
alarmed
rush
and
shouting
up
on
deck
it
was
so
warm
and
comfortable
in
the
berth
and
i
thought
with
intolerable
horror
of
the
possibility
of
sousing
into
the
black
don
t
talk
my
boy
advised
biffen
let
me
read
you
the
new
chapter
of
mr
it
may
induce
a
refreshing
reardon
was
away
from
his
duties
for
a
week
he
returned
to
them
with
a
feeling
of
extreme
shakiness
an
indisposition
to
exert
himself
and
a
complete
disregard
of
the
course
that
events
were
taking
it
was
fortunate
that
he
had
kept
aside
that
small
store
of
money
designed
for
emergencies
he
was
able
to
draw
on
it
now
to
pay
his
doctor
and
provide
himself
with
better
nourishment
than
usual
he
purchased
new
boots
too
and
some
articles
of
warm
clothing
of
which
he
stood
in
need
an
alarming
outlay
a
change
had
come
over
him
he
was
no
longer
rendered
miserable
by
thoughts
of
amy
seldom
indeed
turned
his
mind
to
her
at
all
his
secretaryship
at
croydon
was
a
haven
within
view
the
income
of
pounds
the
other
half
to
go
to
his
wife
would
support
him
luxuriously
and
for
anything
beyond
that
he
seemed
to
care
little
next
sunday
he
was
to
go
over
to
croydon
and
see
the
institution
one
evening
of
calm
weather
he
made
his
way
to
clipstone
street
and
greeted
his
friend
with
more
show
of
than
he
had
been
capable
of
for
at
least
two
years
i
have
been
as
nearly
as
possible
a
happy
man
all
he
said
when
his
pipe
was
well
lit
partly
the
sunshine
i
suppose
there
s
no
saying
if
the
mood
will
last
but
if
it
does
all
is
well
with
me
i
regret
nothing
and
wish
for
a
morbid
state
of
mind
was
biffen
s
opinion
no
doubt
of
that
but
i
am
content
to
be
indebted
to
morbidness
one
must
have
a
rest
from
misery
somehow
another
kind
of
man
would
have
taken
to
drinking
that
has
tempted
me
now
and
then
i
assure
you
but
i
couldn
t
afford
it
did
you
ever
feel
tempted
to
drink
merely
for
the
sake
of
forgetting
trouble
often
enough
i
have
done
it
i
have
deliberately
spent
a
certain
proportion
of
the
money
that
ought
to
have
gone
for
food
in
the
cheapest
kind
of
strong
ha
that
s
interesting
but
it
never
got
the
force
of
a
habit
you
had
to
break
no
partly
i
dare
say
because
i
had
the
warning
of
poor
sykes
before
my
you
never
see
that
poor
fellow
never
he
must
be
dead
i
think
he
would
die
either
in
the
hospital
or
the
well
said
reardon
musing
cheerfully
i
shall
never
become
a
drunkard
i
haven
t
that
diathesis
to
use
your
expression
doesn
t
it
strike
you
that
you
and
i
are
very
respectable
persons
we
really
have
no
vices
put
us
on
a
social
pedestal
and
we
should
be
shining
lights
of
morality
i
sometimes
wonder
at
our
inoffensiveness
why
don
t
we
run
amuck
against
law
and
order
why
at
the
least
don
t
we
become
savage
revolutionists
and
harangue
in
regent
s
park
of
a
sunday
because
we
are
passive
beings
and
were
meant
to
enjoy
life
very
quietly
as
we
can
t
enjoy
we
just
suffer
quietly
that
s
all
i
want
to
talk
about
a
difficulty
in
one
of
the
fragments
of
euripides
did
you
ever
go
through
the
fragments
this
made
a
diversion
for
half
an
hour
then
reardon
returned
to
his
former
line
of
thought
as
i
was
entering
patients
yesterday
there
came
up
to
the
table
a
tall
very
quiet
girl
poorly
dressed
but
as
neat
as
could
be
she
gave
me
her
name
then
i
asked
occupation
she
said
at
once
i
m
unfortunate
i
couldn
t
help
looking
up
at
her
in
surprise
i
had
taken
it
for
granted
she
was
a
dressmaker
or
something
of
the
kind
and
do
you
know
i
never
felt
so
strong
an
impulse
to
shake
hands
to
show
sympathy
and
even
respect
in
some
way
i
should
have
liked
to
say
why
i
am
unfortunate
too
such
a
good
patient
face
she
i
distrust
such
appearances
said
biffen
in
his
quality
of
realist
well
so
do
i
as
a
rule
but
in
this
case
they
were
convincing
and
there
was
no
need
whatever
for
her
to
make
such
a
declaration
she
might
just
as
well
have
said
anything
else
it
s
the
merest
form
i
shall
always
hear
her
voice
saying
i
m
unfortunate
she
made
me
feel
what
a
mistake
it
was
for
me
to
marry
such
a
girl
as
amy
i
ought
to
have
looked
about
for
some
simple
that
was
the
kind
of
wife
indicated
for
me
by
circumstances
if
i
had
earned
a
hundred
a
year
she
would
have
thought
we
were
i
should
have
been
an
authority
to
her
on
everything
under
the
sun
and
above
it
no
ambition
would
have
unsettled
her
we
should
have
lived
in
a
couple
of
poor
rooms
somewhere
and
we
should
have
loved
each
what
a
shameless
idealist
you
are
said
biffen
shaking
his
head
let
me
sketch
the
true
issue
of
such
a
marriage
to
begin
with
the
girl
would
have
married
you
in
firm
persuasion
that
you
were
a
gentleman
in
temporary
difficulties
and
that
before
long
you
would
have
plenty
of
money
to
dispose
of
disappointed
in
this
hope
she
would
have
grown
querulous
selfish
all
your
endeavours
to
make
her
understand
you
would
only
have
resulted
in
widening
the
impassable
gulf
she
would
have
misconstrued
your
every
sentence
found
food
for
suspicion
in
every
harmless
joke
tormented
you
with
the
vulgarest
forms
of
jealousy
the
effect
upon
your
nature
would
have
been
degrading
in
the
end
you
must
have
abandoned
every
effort
to
raise
her
to
your
own
level
and
either
have
sunk
to
hers
or
made
a
rupture
who
doesn
t
know
the
story
of
such
attempts
i
myself
ten
years
ago
was
on
the
point
of
committing
such
a
folly
but
heaven
be
praised
an
accident
saved
you
never
told
me
that
and
don
t
care
to
now
i
prefer
to
forget
well
you
can
judge
for
yourself
but
not
for
me
of
course
i
might
have
chosen
the
wrong
girl
but
i
am
supposing
that
i
had
been
fortunate
in
any
case
there
would
have
been
a
much
better
chance
than
in
the
marriage
that
i
your
marriage
was
sensible
enough
and
a
few
years
hence
you
will
be
a
happy
man
you
seriously
think
amy
will
come
back
to
me
of
course
i
upon
my
word
i
don
t
know
that
i
desire
because
you
are
in
a
strangely
unhealthy
i
rather
think
i
regard
the
matter
more
sanely
than
ever
yet
i
am
quite
free
from
sexual
bias
i
can
see
that
amy
was
not
my
fit
intellectual
companion
and
all
emotion
at
the
thought
of
her
has
gone
from
me
the
word
love
is
a
weariness
to
me
if
only
our
idiotic
laws
permitted
us
to
break
the
legal
bond
how
glad
both
of
us
would
be
you
are
depressed
and
anaemic
get
yourself
in
flesh
and
view
things
like
a
man
of
this
but
don
t
you
think
it
the
best
thing
that
can
happen
to
a
man
if
he
outgrows
passion
in
certain
circumstances
no
in
all
and
any
the
best
moments
of
life
are
those
when
we
contemplate
beauty
in
the
purely
artistic
spirit
objectively
i
have
had
such
moments
in
greece
and
italy
times
when
i
was
a
free
spirit
utterly
remote
from
the
temptations
and
harassings
of
sexual
emotion
what
we
call
love
is
mere
turmoil
who
wouldn
t
release
himself
from
it
for
ever
if
the
possibility
offered
oh
there
s
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
that
of
reardon
s
face
was
illumined
with
the
glow
of
an
exquisite
memory
haven
t
i
told
you
he
said
of
that
marvellous
sunset
at
athens
i
was
on
the
pnyx
had
been
rambling
about
there
the
whole
afternoon
for
i
dare
say
a
couple
of
hours
i
had
noticed
a
growing
rift
of
light
in
the
clouds
to
the
west
it
looked
as
if
the
dull
day
might
have
a
rich
ending
that
rift
grew
broader
and
brighter
the
only
bit
of
light
in
the
sky
on
parnes
there
were
white
strips
of
ragged
mist
hanging
very
low
the
same
on
hymettus
and
even
the
peak
of
lycabettus
was
just
hidden
of
a
sudden
the
sun
s
rays
broke
out
they
showed
themselves
first
in
a
strangely
beautiful
way
striking
from
behind
the
seaward
hills
through
the
pass
that
leads
to
eleusis
and
so
gleaming
on
the
nearer
slopes
of
aigaleos
making
the
clefts
black
and
the
rounded
parts
of
the
mountain
wonderfully
brilliant
with
golden
colour
all
the
rest
of
the
landscape
remember
was
untouched
with
a
ray
of
light
this
lasted
only
a
minute
or
two
then
the
sun
itself
sank
into
the
open
patch
of
sky
and
shot
glory
in
every
direction
broadening
beams
smote
upwards
over
the
dark
clouds
and
made
them
a
lurid
yellow
to
the
left
of
the
sun
the
gulf
of
aegina
was
all
golden
mist
the
islands
floating
in
it
vaguely
to
the
right
over
black
salamis
lay
delicate
strips
of
pale
blue
indescribably
pale
and
you
remember
it
very
as
if
i
saw
it
now
but
wait
i
turned
eastward
and
there
to
my
astonishment
was
a
magnificent
rainbow
a
perfect
semicircle
stretching
from
the
foot
of
parnes
to
that
of
hymettus
framing
athens
and
its
hills
which
grew
brighter
and
brighter
the
brightness
for
which
there
is
no
name
among
colours
hymettus
was
of
a
soft
misty
warmth
a
something
tending
to
purple
its
ridges
marked
by
exquisitely
soft
and
indefinite
shadows
the
rainbow
coming
right
down
in
front
the
acropolis
simply
glowed
and
blazed
as
the
sun
descended
all
these
colours
grew
richer
and
warmer
for
a
moment
the
landscape
was
nearly
crimson
then
suddenly
the
sun
passed
into
the
lower
stratum
of
cloud
and
the
splendour
died
almost
at
once
except
that
there
remained
the
northern
half
of
the
rainbow
which
had
become
double
in
the
west
the
clouds
were
still
glorious
for
a
time
there
were
two
shaped
like
great
expanded
wings
edged
with
stop
cried
biffen
or
i
shall
clutch
you
by
the
throat
i
warned
you
before
that
i
can
t
stand
those
live
in
hope
scrape
together
twenty
pounds
and
go
there
if
you
die
of
hunger
i
shall
never
have
twenty
shillings
was
the
despondent
answer
i
feel
sure
you
will
sell
mr
it
s
kind
of
you
to
encourage
me
but
if
mr
bailey
is
ever
sold
i
don
t
mind
undertaking
to
eat
my
duplicate
of
the
but
now
you
remember
what
led
me
to
that
what
does
a
man
care
for
any
woman
on
earth
when
he
is
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
that
kind
but
it
is
only
one
of
life
s
i
am
only
maintaining
that
it
is
the
best
and
infinitely
preferable
to
sexual
emotion
it
leaves
no
doubt
no
bitterness
of
any
kind
poverty
can
t
rob
me
of
those
memories
i
have
lived
in
an
ideal
world
that
was
not
deceitful
a
world
which
seems
to
me
when
i
recall
it
beyond
the
human
sphere
bathed
in
diviner
it
was
four
or
five
days
after
this
that
reardon
on
going
to
his
work
in
city
road
found
a
note
from
carter
it
requested
him
to
call
at
the
main
hospital
at
eleven
the
next
morning
he
supposed
the
appointment
had
something
to
do
with
his
business
at
croydon
whither
he
had
been
in
the
mean
time
some
unfavourable
news
perhaps
any
misfortune
was
likely
he
answered
the
summons
punctually
and
on
entering
the
general
office
was
requested
by
the
clerk
to
wait
in
mr
carter
s
private
room
the
secretary
had
not
yet
arrived
his
waiting
lasted
some
ten
minutes
then
the
door
opened
and
admitted
not
carter
but
mrs
edmund
yule
reardon
stood
up
in
perturbation
he
was
anything
but
prepared
or
disposed
for
an
interview
with
this
lady
she
came
towards
him
with
hand
extended
and
a
countenance
of
suave
friendliness
i
doubted
whether
you
would
see
me
if
i
let
you
know
she
said
forgive
me
this
little
bit
of
scheming
will
you
i
have
something
so
very
important
to
speak
to
you
he
said
nothing
but
kept
a
demeanour
of
courtesy
i
think
you
haven
t
heard
from
amy
mrs
yule
asked
not
since
i
saw
and
you
don
t
know
what
has
come
to
pass
i
have
heard
of
i
am
come
to
see
you
quite
on
my
own
responsibility
quite
i
took
mr
carter
into
my
confidence
but
begged
him
not
to
let
mrs
carter
know
lest
she
should
tell
amy
i
think
he
will
keep
his
promise
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
really
my
duty
to
do
whatever
i
could
in
these
sad
sad
reardon
listened
respectfully
but
without
sign
of
feeling
i
had
better
tell
you
at
once
that
amy
s
uncle
at
wattleborough
is
dead
and
that
in
his
will
he
has
bequeathed
her
ten
thousand
mrs
yule
watched
the
effect
of
this
for
a
moment
none
was
visible
but
she
saw
at
length
that
reardon
s
lips
trembled
and
his
eyebrows
twitched
i
am
glad
to
hear
of
her
good
fortune
he
said
distantly
and
in
even
tones
you
will
feel
i
am
sure
continued
his
that
this
must
put
an
end
to
your
most
unhappy
how
can
it
have
that
result
it
puts
you
both
in
a
very
different
position
does
it
not
but
for
your
distressing
circumstances
i
am
sure
there
would
never
have
been
such
unpleasantness
never
neither
you
nor
amy
is
the
kind
of
person
to
take
a
pleasure
in
disagreement
let
me
beg
you
to
go
and
see
her
again
everything
is
so
different
now
amy
has
not
the
faintest
idea
that
i
have
come
to
see
you
and
she
mustn
t
on
any
account
be
told
for
her
worst
fault
is
that
sensitive
pride
of
hers
and
i
m
sure
you
won
t
be
offended
edwin
if
i
say
that
you
have
very
much
the
same
failing
between
two
such
sensitive
people
differences
might
last
a
lifetime
unless
one
could
be
persuaded
to
take
the
first
step
do
be
generous
a
woman
is
privileged
to
be
a
little
obstinate
it
is
always
said
overlook
the
fault
and
persuade
her
to
let
bygones
be
there
was
an
involuntary
affectedness
in
mrs
yule
s
speech
which
repelled
reardon
he
could
not
even
put
faith
in
her
assurance
that
amy
knew
nothing
of
this
intercession
in
any
case
it
was
extremely
distasteful
to
him
to
discuss
such
matters
with
mrs
yule
under
no
circumstances
could
i
do
more
than
i
already
have
done
he
replied
and
after
what
you
have
told
me
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
go
and
see
her
unless
she
expressly
invites
oh
if
only
you
would
overcome
this
sensitiveness
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
do
so
my
poverty
as
you
justly
say
was
the
cause
of
our
parting
but
if
amy
is
no
longer
poor
that
is
very
far
from
a
reason
why
i
should
go
to
her
as
a
suppliant
for
but
do
consider
the
facts
of
the
case
independently
of
feeling
i
really
think
i
don
t
go
too
far
in
saying
that
at
least
some
some
provocation
was
given
by
you
first
of
all
i
am
so
very
very
far
from
wishing
to
say
anything
disagreeable
i
am
sure
you
feel
that
but
wasn
t
there
some
little
ground
for
complaint
on
amy
s
part
wasn
t
there
now
reardon
was
tortured
with
nervousness
he
wished
to
be
alone
to
think
over
what
had
happened
and
mrs
yule
s
urgent
voice
rasped
upon
his
ears
its
very
smoothness
made
it
worse
there
may
have
been
ground
for
grief
and
concern
he
answered
but
for
complaint
no
i
think
but
i
understand
the
voice
sounded
rather
irritable
now
that
you
positively
reproached
and
upbraided
her
because
she
was
reluctant
to
go
and
live
in
some
very
shocking
i
may
have
lost
my
temper
after
amy
had
shown
but
i
can
t
review
our
troubles
in
this
am
i
to
plead
in
vain
i
regret
very
much
that
i
can
t
possibly
do
as
you
wish
it
is
all
between
amy
and
myself
interference
by
other
people
can
not
do
any
i
am
sorry
you
should
use
such
a
word
as
interference
replied
mrs
yule
bridling
a
little
very
sorry
indeed
i
confess
it
didn
t
occur
to
me
that
my
to
you
could
be
seen
in
that
believe
me
that
i
didn
t
use
the
word
then
you
refuse
to
take
any
step
towards
a
restoration
of
good
feeling
i
am
obliged
to
and
amy
would
understand
perfectly
why
i
say
his
earnestness
was
so
unmistakable
that
mrs
yule
had
no
choice
but
to
rise
and
bring
the
interview
to
an
end
she
commanded
herself
sufficiently
to
offer
a
regretful
hand
i
can
only
say
that
my
daughter
is
very
very
reardon
lingered
a
little
after
her
departure
then
left
the
hospital
and
walked
at
a
rapid
pace
in
no
particular
direction
ah
if
this
had
happened
in
the
first
year
of
his
marriage
what
more
blessed
man
than
he
would
have
walked
the
earth
but
it
came
after
irreparable
harm
no
amount
of
wealth
could
undo
the
ruin
caused
by
poverty
it
was
natural
for
him
as
soon
as
he
could
think
with
deliberation
to
turn
towards
his
only
friend
but
on
calling
at
the
house
in
clipstone
street
he
found
the
garret
empty
and
no
one
could
tell
him
when
its
occupant
was
likely
to
be
back
he
left
a
note
and
made
his
way
back
to
islington
the
evening
had
to
be
spent
at
the
hospital
but
on
his
return
biffen
sat
waiting
for
him
you
called
about
twelve
didn
t
you
the
visitor
inquired
i
was
at
the
odd
thing
but
it
always
happens
so
that
i
should
have
spoken
of
sykes
the
other
night
last
night
i
came
upon
a
crowd
in
oxford
street
and
the
nucleus
of
it
was
no
other
than
sykes
himself
very
drunk
and
disorderly
in
the
grip
of
two
policemen
nothing
could
be
done
for
him
i
was
useless
as
bail
he
e
en
had
to
sleep
in
the
cell
but
i
went
this
morning
to
see
what
would
become
of
him
such
a
spectacle
when
they
brought
him
forward
it
was
only
five
shillings
fine
and
to
my
astonishment
he
produced
the
money
i
joined
him
outside
it
required
a
little
courage
and
had
a
long
talk
with
him
he
s
writing
a
london
letter
for
some
provincial
daily
and
the
first
payment
had
thrown
him
off
his
reardon
laughed
gaily
and
made
inquiries
about
the
eccentric
gentleman
only
when
the
subject
was
exhausted
did
he
speak
of
his
own
concerns
relating
quietly
what
he
had
learnt
from
mrs
yule
biffen
s
eyes
widened
so
reardon
cried
with
exultation
there
is
the
last
burden
off
my
mind
henceforth
i
haven
t
a
care
the
only
thing
that
still
troubled
me
was
my
inability
to
give
amy
enough
to
live
upon
now
she
is
provided
for
in
secula
seculorum
isn
t
this
grand
news
decidedly
but
if
she
is
provided
for
so
are
biffen
you
know
me
better
could
i
accept
a
farthing
of
her
money
this
has
made
our
coming
together
again
for
ever
impossible
unless
unless
dead
things
can
come
to
life
i
know
the
value
of
money
but
i
can
t
take
it
from
the
other
kept
silence
no
but
now
everything
is
well
she
has
her
child
and
can
devote
herself
to
bringing
the
boy
up
and
i
but
i
shall
be
rich
on
my
own
account
a
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
it
would
be
a
farce
to
offer
amy
her
share
of
it
by
all
the
gods
of
olympus
we
will
go
to
greece
together
you
and
i
pooh
i
swear
it
let
me
save
for
a
couple
of
years
and
then
get
a
good
month
s
holiday
or
more
if
possible
and
as
pallas
athene
liveth
we
shall
find
ourselves
at
marseilles
going
aboard
some
boat
of
the
messageries
i
can
t
believe
yet
that
this
is
true
come
we
will
have
a
supper
come
out
into
upper
street
and
let
us
eat
drink
and
be
merry
you
are
beside
yourself
but
never
mind
let
us
rejoice
by
all
means
there
s
every
that
poor
girl
now
at
last
she
ll
be
at
who
amy
of
course
i
m
delighted
on
her
account
ah
but
if
it
had
come
a
long
time
ago
in
the
happy
days
then
she
too
would
have
gone
to
greece
wouldn
t
she
everything
in
life
comes
too
soon
or
too
late
what
it
would
have
meant
for
her
and
for
me
she
would
never
have
hated
me
then
never
biffen
am
i
base
or
contemptible
she
thinks
so
that
s
how
poverty
has
served
me
if
you
had
seen
her
how
she
looked
at
me
when
we
met
the
other
day
you
would
understand
well
enough
why
i
couldn
t
live
with
her
now
not
if
she
entreated
me
to
that
would
make
me
base
if
you
like
gods
how
ashamed
i
should
be
if
i
yielded
to
such
a
temptation
and
once
he
had
worked
himself
to
such
intensity
of
feeling
that
at
length
his
voice
choked
and
tears
burst
from
his
eyes
come
out
and
let
us
have
a
walk
said
biffen
on
leaving
the
house
they
found
themselves
in
a
thick
fog
through
which
trickled
drops
of
warm
rain
nevertheless
they
pursued
their
purpose
and
presently
were
seated
in
one
of
the
boxes
of
a
small
their
only
companion
in
the
place
was
a
who
had
just
finished
a
meal
and
was
now
nodding
into
slumber
over
his
plate
and
cup
reardon
ordered
fried
ham
and
eggs
the
luxury
of
the
poor
and
when
the
attendant
woman
was
gone
away
to
execute
the
order
he
burst
into
excited
laughter
here
we
sit
two
literary
men
how
should
we
be
regarded
by
he
named
two
or
three
of
the
successful
novelists
of
the
day
with
what
magnificent
scorn
they
would
turn
from
us
and
our
squalid
feast
they
have
never
known
struggle
not
they
they
are
men
university
men
club
men
society
men
an
income
of
less
than
three
or
four
hundred
a
year
is
inconceivable
to
them
that
seems
the
minimum
for
an
educated
man
s
support
it
would
be
to
think
of
them
with
rancour
but
by
apollo
i
know
that
we
should
change
places
with
them
if
the
work
we
have
done
were
justly
weighed
against
what
does
it
matter
we
are
different
types
of
intellectual
workers
i
think
of
them
savagely
now
and
then
but
only
when
hunger
gets
a
trifle
too
keen
their
work
answers
a
demand
ours
or
mine
at
all
events
doesn
t
they
are
in
touch
with
the
reading
multitude
they
have
the
sentiments
of
the
respectable
they
write
for
their
class
well
you
had
your
circle
of
readers
and
if
things
hadn
t
gone
against
you
by
this
time
you
certainly
could
have
counted
on
your
three
or
four
hundred
a
it
s
unlikely
that
i
should
ever
have
got
more
than
two
hundred
pounds
for
a
book
and
to
have
kept
at
my
best
i
must
have
been
content
to
publish
once
every
two
or
three
years
the
position
was
untenable
with
no
private
income
and
i
must
needs
marry
a
wife
of
dainty
instincts
what
astounding
impudence
no
wonder
fate
pitched
me
aside
into
the
they
ate
their
ham
and
eggs
and
exhilarated
themselves
with
a
cup
of
chicory
called
coffee
then
biffen
drew
from
the
pocket
of
his
venerable
overcoat
the
volume
of
euripides
he
had
brought
and
their
talk
turned
once
more
to
the
land
of
the
sun
only
when
the
was
closed
did
they
go
forth
again
into
the
foggy
street
and
at
the
top
of
pentonville
hill
they
stood
for
ten
minutes
debating
a
metrical
effect
in
one
of
the
fragments
day
after
day
reardon
went
about
with
a
fever
upon
him
by
evening
his
pulse
was
always
rapid
and
no
extremity
of
weariness
brought
him
a
refreshing
sleep
in
conversation
he
seemed
either
depressed
or
excited
more
often
the
latter
save
when
attending
to
his
duties
at
the
hospital
he
made
no
pretence
of
employing
himself
if
at
home
he
sat
for
hours
without
opening
a
book
and
his
walks
excepting
when
they
led
him
to
clipstone
street
were
aimless
the
hours
of
postal
delivery
found
him
waiting
in
an
anguish
of
suspense
at
eight
o
clock
each
morning
he
stood
by
his
window
listening
for
the
postman
s
knock
in
the
street
as
it
approached
he
went
out
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
if
the
knock
sounded
at
the
door
of
his
house
he
leaned
over
the
banisters
trembling
in
expectation
but
the
letter
was
never
for
him
when
his
agitation
had
subsided
he
felt
glad
of
the
disappointment
and
laughed
and
sang
one
day
carter
appeared
at
the
city
road
establishment
and
made
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
his
clerk
in
private
i
suppose
he
said
with
a
smile
they
ll
have
to
look
out
for
someone
else
at
croydon
by
no
means
the
thing
is
settled
i
go
at
you
really
mean
that
seeing
that
reardon
was
not
disposed
even
to
allude
to
private
circumstances
the
secretary
said
no
more
and
went
away
convinced
that
misfortunes
had
turned
the
poor
fellow
s
brain
wandering
in
the
city
about
this
time
reardon
encountered
his
friend
the
realist
would
you
like
to
meet
sykes
asked
biffen
i
am
just
going
to
see
where
does
he
live
in
some
indiscoverable
hole
to
save
fuel
he
spends
his
mornings
at
some
the
admission
is
only
a
penny
and
there
he
can
see
all
the
papers
and
do
his
writing
and
enjoy
a
grateful
they
repaired
to
the
haunt
in
question
a
flight
of
stairs
brought
them
to
a
small
room
in
which
were
exposed
the
daily
newspapers
another
ascent
and
they
were
in
a
room
devoted
to
magazines
chess
and
refreshments
yet
another
and
they
reached
the
department
of
weekly
publications
lastly
at
the
top
of
the
house
they
found
a
lavatory
and
a
chamber
for
the
use
of
those
who
desired
to
write
the
walls
of
this
last
retreat
were
of
blue
plaster
and
sloped
inwards
from
the
floor
along
them
stood
school
desks
with
benches
and
in
one
place
was
suspended
a
ragged
and
dirty
card
announcing
that
paper
and
envelopes
could
be
purchased
downstairs
an
enormous
basket
full
of
and
a
small
stove
occupied
two
corners
ink
blotches
satirical
designs
and
much
scribbling
in
pen
and
pencil
served
for
mural
adornment
from
the
adjacent
lavatory
came
sounds
of
splashing
and
spluttering
and
the
busy
street
far
below
sent
up
its
confused
noises
two
persons
only
sat
at
the
desks
one
was
a
clerk
evidently
engaged
in
replying
to
advertisements
in
front
of
him
lay
two
or
three
finished
letters
and
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
were
several
crumpled
sheets
of
representing
abortive
essays
in
composition
the
other
man
also
occupied
with
the
pen
looked
about
forty
years
old
and
was
clad
in
a
very
rusty
suit
of
tweeds
on
the
bench
beside
him
lay
a
grey
overcoat
and
a
silk
hat
which
had
for
some
time
been
moulting
his
face
declared
the
habit
to
which
he
was
a
victim
but
it
had
nothing
repulsive
in
its
lineaments
and
expression
on
the
contrary
it
was
pleasing
amiable
and
rather
quaint
at
this
moment
no
one
would
have
doubted
his
sobriety
with
turned
back
so
as
to
give
free
play
to
his
right
hand
and
wrist
revealing
meanwhile
a
flannel
shirt
of
singular
colour
and
with
his
collar
unbuttoned
he
wore
no
tie
to
leave
his
throat
at
ease
as
he
bent
myopically
over
the
paper
he
was
writing
at
express
speed
evidently
in
the
full
rush
of
the
ardour
of
composition
the
veins
of
his
forehead
were
dilated
and
his
chin
pushed
forward
in
a
way
that
made
one
think
of
a
racing
horse
are
you
too
busy
to
talk
asked
biffen
going
to
his
side
i
am
upon
my
soul
i
am
exclaimed
the
other
looking
up
in
alarm
for
the
love
of
heaven
don
t
put
me
out
a
quarter
of
an
hour
all
right
i
ll
come
up
the
friends
went
downstairs
and
turned
over
the
papers
now
let
s
try
him
again
said
biffen
when
considerably
more
than
the
requested
time
had
elapsed
they
went
up
and
found
mr
sykes
in
an
attitude
of
melancholy
meditation
he
had
turned
back
his
coat
sleeve
had
buttoned
his
collar
and
was
eyeing
the
slips
of
completed
manuscript
biffen
presented
his
companion
and
mr
sykes
greeted
the
novelist
with
much
geniality
what
do
you
think
this
is
he
exclaimed
pointing
to
his
work
the
first
instalment
of
my
autobiography
for
the
shropshire
weekly
anonymous
of
course
but
strictly
veracious
with
the
omission
of
sundry
little
personal
failings
which
are
nothing
to
the
point
i
call
it
through
the
wilds
of
literary
an
old
friend
of
mine
edits
the
herald
and
i
m
indebted
to
him
for
the
his
voice
was
a
trifle
husky
but
he
spoke
like
a
man
of
education
most
people
will
take
it
for
fiction
i
wish
i
had
inventive
power
enough
to
write
fiction
anything
like
it
i
have
published
novels
mr
reardon
but
my
experience
in
that
branch
of
literature
was
peculiar
as
i
may
say
it
has
been
in
most
others
to
which
i
have
applied
myself
my
first
stories
were
written
for
the
young
lady
s
favourite
and
most
remarkable
productions
they
were
i
promise
you
that
was
fifteen
years
ago
in
the
days
of
my
versatility
i
could
throw
off
my
supplemental
novelette
of
fifteen
thousand
words
without
turning
a
hair
and
immediately
after
it
fall
to
fresh
as
a
daisy
on
the
illustrated
history
of
the
united
states
which
i
was
then
doing
for
edward
coghlan
but
presently
i
thought
myself
too
good
for
the
favourite
in
an
evil
day
i
began
to
write
novels
aiming
at
reputation
it
wouldn
t
do
i
persevered
for
five
years
and
made
about
five
failures
then
i
went
back
to
bowring
take
me
on
again
old
man
will
you
bowring
was
a
man
of
few
words
he
said
blaze
away
my
and
i
tried
to
but
it
was
no
use
i
had
got
out
of
the
style
my
writing
was
too
literary
by
a
long
chalk
for
a
whole
year
i
deliberately
strove
to
write
badly
but
bowring
was
so
pained
with
the
feebleness
of
my
efforts
that
at
last
he
sternly
bade
me
avoid
his
sight
what
the
devil
he
roared
one
day
do
you
mean
by
sending
me
stories
about
men
and
women
you
ought
to
know
better
than
that
a
fellow
of
your
experience
so
i
had
to
give
it
up
and
there
was
an
end
of
my
career
as
a
writer
of
he
shook
his
head
sadly
biffen
he
continued
when
i
first
made
his
acquaintance
had
an
idea
of
writing
for
the
working
classes
and
what
do
you
think
he
was
going
to
offer
them
stories
about
the
working
classes
nay
never
hang
your
head
for
it
old
boy
it
was
excusable
in
the
days
of
your
youth
why
mr
reardon
as
no
doubt
you
know
well
enough
nothing
can
induce
working
men
or
women
to
read
stories
that
treat
of
their
own
world
they
are
the
most
consumed
idealists
in
creation
especially
the
women
again
and
again
have
said
to
me
oh
i
don
t
like
that
book
it
s
nothing
but
real
it
s
the
fault
of
women
in
general
remarked
reardon
so
it
is
but
it
comes
out
with
delicious
naivete
in
the
working
classes
now
educated
people
like
to
read
of
scenes
that
are
familiar
to
them
though
i
grant
you
that
the
picture
must
be
idealised
if
you
re
to
appeal
to
more
than
one
in
a
thousand
the
working
classes
detest
anything
that
tries
to
represent
their
daily
life
it
isn
t
because
that
life
is
too
painful
no
no
it
s
downright
snobbishness
dickens
goes
down
only
with
the
best
of
them
and
then
solely
because
of
his
strength
in
farce
and
his
presently
the
three
went
out
together
and
had
dinner
at
an
a
la
mode
beef
shop
mr
sykes
ate
little
but
took
copious
libations
of
porter
at
twopence
a
pint
when
the
meal
was
over
he
grew
taciturn
can
you
walk
westwards
biffen
asked
i
m
afraid
not
afraid
not
in
fact
i
have
an
appointment
at
two
at
aldgate
they
parted
from
him
now
he
ll
go
and
soak
till
he
s
unconscious
said
biffen
poor
fellow
pity
he
ever
earns
anything
at
all
the
workhouse
would
be
better
i
should
no
no
let
a
man
drink
himself
to
death
rather
i
have
a
horror
of
the
workhouse
remember
the
clock
at
marylebone
i
used
to
tell
you
unphilosophic
i
don
t
think
i
should
be
unhappy
in
the
workhouse
i
should
have
a
certain
satisfaction
in
the
thought
that
i
had
forced
society
to
support
me
and
then
the
absolute
freedom
from
care
why
it
s
very
much
the
same
as
being
a
man
of
independent
it
was
about
a
week
after
this
midway
in
november
that
there
at
length
came
to
manville
street
a
letter
addressed
in
amy
s
hand
it
arrived
at
three
one
afternoon
reardon
heard
the
postman
but
he
had
ceased
to
rush
out
on
every
such
occasion
and
he
was
feeling
ill
lying
upon
the
bed
he
had
just
raised
his
head
wearily
when
he
became
aware
that
someone
was
mounting
to
his
room
he
sprang
up
his
face
and
neck
flushing
this
time
amy
began
dear
edwin
the
sight
of
those
words
made
his
brain
swim
you
must
of
course
have
heard
she
wrote
that
my
uncle
john
has
left
me
ten
thousand
pounds
it
has
not
yet
come
into
my
possession
and
i
had
decided
that
i
would
not
write
to
you
till
that
happened
but
perhaps
you
may
altogether
misunderstand
my
silence
if
this
money
had
come
to
me
when
you
were
struggling
so
hard
to
earn
a
living
for
us
we
should
never
have
spoken
the
words
and
thought
the
thoughts
which
now
make
it
so
difficult
for
me
to
write
to
you
what
i
wish
to
say
is
that
although
the
property
is
legally
my
own
i
quite
recognise
that
you
have
a
right
to
share
in
it
since
we
have
lived
apart
you
have
sent
me
far
more
than
you
could
really
afford
believing
it
your
duty
to
do
so
now
that
things
are
so
different
i
wish
you
as
well
as
myself
to
benefit
by
the
change
i
said
at
our
last
meeting
that
i
should
be
quite
prepared
to
return
to
you
if
you
took
that
position
at
croydon
there
is
now
no
need
for
you
to
pursue
a
kind
of
work
for
which
you
are
quite
unfitted
and
i
repeat
that
i
am
willing
to
live
with
you
as
before
if
you
will
tell
me
where
you
would
like
to
make
a
new
home
i
shall
gladly
agree
i
do
not
think
you
would
care
to
leave
london
permanently
and
certainly
i
should
not
please
to
let
me
hear
from
you
as
soon
as
possible
in
writing
like
this
i
feel
that
i
have
done
what
you
expressed
a
wish
that
i
should
do
i
have
asked
you
to
put
an
end
to
our
separation
and
i
trust
that
i
have
not
asked
in
vain
yours
always
amy
the
letter
fell
from
his
hand
it
was
such
a
letter
as
he
might
have
expected
but
the
beginning
misled
him
and
as
his
agitation
throbbed
itself
away
he
suffered
an
encroachment
of
despair
which
made
him
for
a
time
unable
to
move
or
even
think
his
reply
written
by
the
dreary
twilight
which
represented
sunset
ran
thus
dear
amy
i
thank
you
for
your
letter
and
i
appreciate
your
motive
in
writing
it
but
if
you
feel
that
you
have
done
what
i
expressed
a
wish
that
you
should
do
you
must
have
strangely
misunderstood
me
the
only
one
thing
that
i
wished
was
that
by
some
miracle
your
love
for
me
might
be
revived
can
i
persuade
myself
that
this
is
the
letter
of
a
wife
who
desires
to
return
to
me
because
in
her
heart
she
loves
me
if
that
is
the
truth
you
have
been
most
unfortunate
in
trying
to
express
yourself
you
have
written
because
it
seemed
your
duty
to
do
so
but
indeed
a
sense
of
duty
such
as
this
is
a
mistaken
one
you
have
no
love
for
me
and
where
there
is
no
love
there
is
no
mutual
obligation
in
marriage
perhaps
you
think
that
regard
for
social
conventions
will
necessitate
your
living
with
me
again
but
have
more
courage
refuse
to
act
falsehoods
tell
society
it
is
base
and
brutal
and
that
you
prefer
to
live
an
honest
life
i
can
not
share
your
wealth
dear
but
as
you
have
no
longer
need
of
my
help
as
we
are
now
quite
independent
of
each
other
i
shall
cease
to
send
the
money
which
hitherto
i
have
considered
yours
in
this
way
i
shall
have
enough
and
more
than
enough
for
my
necessities
so
that
you
will
never
have
to
trouble
yourself
with
the
thought
that
i
am
suffering
privations
at
christmas
i
go
to
croydon
and
i
will
then
write
to
you
again
for
we
may
at
all
events
be
friendly
my
mind
is
relieved
from
ceaseless
anxiety
on
your
account
i
know
now
that
you
are
safe
from
that
accursed
poverty
which
is
to
blame
for
all
our
sufferings
you
i
do
not
blame
though
i
have
sometimes
done
so
my
own
experience
teaches
me
how
kindness
can
be
embittered
by
misfortune
some
great
and
noble
sorrow
may
have
the
effect
of
drawing
hearts
together
but
to
struggle
against
destitution
to
be
crushed
by
care
about
shillings
and
sixpences
that
must
always
degrade
no
other
reply
than
this
is
possible
so
i
beg
you
not
to
write
in
this
way
again
let
me
know
if
you
go
to
live
elsewhere
i
hope
willie
is
well
and
that
his
growth
is
still
a
delight
and
happiness
to
you
edwin
that
one
word
dear
occurring
in
the
middle
of
the
letter
gave
him
pause
as
he
read
the
lines
over
should
he
not
obliterate
it
and
even
in
such
a
way
that
amy
might
see
what
he
had
done
his
pen
was
dipped
in
the
ink
for
that
purpose
but
after
all
he
held
his
hand
amy
was
still
dear
to
him
say
what
he
might
and
if
she
noted
the
word
if
she
pondered
over
it
a
street
gas
lamp
prevented
the
room
from
becoming
absolutely
dark
when
he
had
closed
the
envelope
he
lay
down
on
his
bed
again
and
watched
the
flickering
yellowness
upon
the
ceiling
he
ought
to
have
some
tea
before
going
to
the
hospital
but
he
cared
so
little
for
it
that
the
trouble
of
boiling
water
was
too
great
the
flickering
light
grew
fainter
he
understood
at
length
that
this
was
caused
by
fog
that
had
begun
to
descend
the
fog
was
his
enemy
it
would
be
wise
to
purchase
a
respirator
if
this
hideous
weather
continued
for
sometimes
his
throat
burned
and
there
was
a
rasping
in
his
chest
which
gave
disagreeable
admonition
he
fell
asleep
for
half
an
hour
and
on
awaking
he
was
feverish
as
usual
at
this
time
of
day
well
it
was
time
to
go
to
his
work
ugh
that
first
mouthful
of
fog
chapter
xxviii
interim
the
rooms
which
milvain
had
taken
for
himself
and
his
sisters
were
modest
but
more
expensive
than
their
old
quarters
as
the
change
was
on
his
account
he
held
himself
responsible
for
the
extra
outlay
but
for
his
immediate
prospects
this
step
would
have
been
unwarrantable
as
his
earnings
were
only
just
sufficient
for
his
needs
on
the
previous
footing
he
had
resolved
that
his
marriage
must
take
place
before
christmas
till
that
event
he
would
draw
when
necessary
upon
the
girls
little
store
and
then
repay
them
out
of
marian
s
dowry
and
what
are
we
to
do
when
you
are
married
asked
dora
the
question
was
put
on
the
first
evening
of
their
being
all
under
the
same
roof
the
trio
had
had
supper
in
the
girls
and
it
was
a
moment
for
frank
conversation
dora
rejoiced
in
the
coming
marriage
her
brother
had
behaved
honourably
and
marian
she
trusted
would
be
very
happy
notwithstanding
disagreement
with
her
father
which
seemed
inevitable
maud
was
by
no
means
so
well
pleased
though
she
endeavoured
to
wear
smiles
it
looked
to
her
as
if
jasper
had
been
guilty
of
a
kind
of
weakness
not
to
be
expected
in
him
marian
as
an
individual
could
not
be
considered
an
appropriate
wife
for
such
a
man
with
such
a
future
and
as
for
her
five
thousand
pounds
that
was
ridiculous
had
it
been
ten
something
can
be
made
of
ten
thousand
but
a
paltry
five
maud
s
ideas
on
such
subjects
had
notably
expanded
of
late
and
one
of
the
results
was
that
she
did
not
live
so
harmoniously
with
her
sister
as
for
the
first
few
months
of
their
london
career
i
have
been
thinking
a
good
deal
about
that
replied
jasper
to
the
younger
girl
s
question
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
smoked
a
cigarette
i
thought
at
first
of
taking
a
flat
but
then
a
flat
of
the
kind
i
should
want
would
be
twice
the
rent
of
a
large
house
if
we
have
a
house
with
plenty
of
room
in
it
you
might
come
and
live
with
us
after
a
time
at
first
i
must
find
you
decent
lodgings
in
our
you
show
a
good
deal
of
generosity
jasper
said
maud
but
pray
remember
that
marian
isn
t
bringing
you
five
thousand
a
i
regret
to
say
that
she
isn
t
what
she
brings
me
is
five
hundred
a
year
for
ten
years
that
s
how
i
look
at
it
my
own
income
will
make
it
something
between
six
or
seven
hundred
at
first
and
before
long
probably
more
like
a
thousand
i
am
quite
cool
and
collected
i
understand
exactly
where
i
am
and
where
i
am
likely
to
be
ten
years
hence
marian
s
money
is
to
be
spent
in
obtaining
a
position
for
myself
at
present
i
am
spoken
of
as
a
smart
young
fellow
and
that
kind
of
thing
but
no
one
would
offer
me
an
editorship
or
any
other
serious
help
wait
till
i
show
that
i
have
helped
myself
and
hands
will
be
stretched
to
me
from
every
side
tis
the
way
of
the
world
i
shall
belong
to
a
club
i
shall
give
nice
quiet
little
dinners
to
selected
people
i
shall
let
it
be
understood
by
all
and
sundry
that
i
have
a
social
position
thenceforth
i
am
quite
a
different
man
a
man
to
be
taken
into
account
and
what
will
you
bet
me
that
i
don
t
stand
in
the
foremost
rank
of
literary
reputabilities
ten
years
hence
i
doubt
whether
six
or
seven
hundred
a
year
will
be
enough
for
if
not
i
am
prepared
to
spend
a
thousand
bless
my
soul
as
if
two
or
three
years
wouldn
t
suffice
to
draw
out
the
mean
qualities
in
the
kind
of
people
i
am
thinking
of
i
say
ten
to
leave
myself
a
great
marian
approves
this
i
haven
t
distinctly
spoken
of
it
but
she
approves
whatever
i
think
the
girls
laughed
at
his
way
of
pronouncing
this
and
let
us
just
suppose
that
you
are
so
unfortunate
as
to
fail
there
s
no
supposing
it
unless
of
course
i
lose
my
health
i
am
not
presuming
on
any
wonderful
development
of
powers
such
as
i
am
now
i
need
only
to
be
put
on
the
little
pedestal
of
a
decent
independence
and
plenty
of
people
will
point
fingers
of
admiration
at
me
you
don
t
fully
appreciate
this
mind
it
wouldn
t
do
if
i
had
no
qualities
i
have
the
qualities
they
only
need
bringing
into
prominence
if
i
am
an
unknown
man
and
publish
a
wonderful
book
it
will
make
its
way
very
slowly
or
not
at
all
if
i
become
a
known
man
publish
that
very
same
book
its
praise
will
echo
over
both
hemispheres
i
should
be
within
the
truth
if
i
had
said
a
vastly
inferior
book
but
i
am
in
a
bland
mood
at
present
suppose
poor
reardon
s
novels
had
been
published
in
the
full
light
of
reputation
instead
of
in
the
struggling
dawn
which
was
never
to
become
day
wouldn
t
they
have
been
magnified
by
every
critic
you
have
to
become
famous
before
you
can
secure
the
attention
which
would
give
he
delivered
this
apophthegm
with
emphasis
and
repeated
it
in
another
form
you
have
to
obtain
reputation
before
you
can
get
a
fair
hearing
for
that
which
would
justify
your
repute
it
s
the
old
story
of
the
french
publisher
who
said
to
dumas
make
a
name
and
i
ll
publish
anything
you
but
how
the
diable
cries
the
author
am
i
to
make
a
name
if
i
can
t
get
published
if
a
man
can
t
hit
upon
any
other
way
of
attracting
attention
let
him
dance
on
his
head
in
the
middle
of
the
street
after
that
he
may
hope
to
get
consideration
for
his
volume
of
poems
i
am
speaking
of
men
who
wish
to
win
reputation
before
they
are
toothless
of
course
if
your
work
is
strong
and
you
can
afford
to
wait
the
probability
is
that
half
a
dozen
people
will
at
last
begin
to
shout
that
you
have
been
monstrously
neglected
as
you
have
but
that
happens
when
you
are
hoary
and
sapless
and
when
nothing
under
the
sun
delights
he
lit
a
new
cigarette
now
i
my
dear
girls
am
not
a
man
who
can
afford
to
wait
first
of
all
my
qualities
are
not
of
the
kind
which
demand
the
recognition
of
posterity
my
writing
is
for
most
distinctly
hodiernal
it
has
no
value
save
in
reference
to
the
question
is
how
can
i
get
the
eyes
of
men
fixed
upon
me
the
answer
by
pretending
i
am
quite
independent
of
their
gaze
i
shall
succeed
without
any
kind
of
doubt
and
then
i
ll
have
a
medal
struck
to
celebrate
the
day
of
my
but
jasper
was
not
quite
so
well
assured
of
the
prudence
of
what
he
was
about
to
do
as
he
wished
his
sisters
to
believe
the
impulse
to
which
he
had
finally
yielded
still
kept
its
force
indeed
was
stronger
than
ever
since
the
intimacy
of
lovers
dialogue
had
revealed
to
him
more
of
marian
s
heart
and
mind
undeniably
he
was
in
love
not
passionately
not
with
the
consuming
desire
which
makes
every
motive
seem
paltry
compared
with
its
own
satisfaction
but
still
quite
sufficiently
in
love
to
have
a
great
difficulty
in
pursuing
his
daily
tasks
this
did
not
still
the
voice
which
bade
him
remember
all
the
opportunities
and
hopes
he
was
throwing
aside
since
the
plighting
of
troth
with
marian
he
had
been
over
to
wimbledon
to
the
house
of
his
friend
and
patron
mr
horace
barlow
and
there
he
had
again
met
with
miss
rupert
this
lady
had
no
power
whatever
over
his
emotions
but
he
felt
assured
that
she
regarded
him
with
strong
interest
when
he
imagined
the
possibility
of
contracting
a
marriage
with
miss
rupert
who
would
make
him
at
once
a
man
of
solid
means
his
head
drooped
and
he
wondered
at
his
precipitation
it
had
to
be
confessed
that
he
was
the
victim
of
a
vulgar
weakness
he
had
declared
himself
not
of
the
first
order
of
progressive
men
the
conversation
with
amy
reardon
did
not
tend
to
put
his
mind
at
rest
amy
was
astonished
at
so
indiscreet
a
step
in
a
man
of
his
calibre
ah
if
only
amy
herself
were
free
with
her
ten
thousand
pounds
to
dispose
of
she
he
felt
sure
did
not
view
him
with
indifference
was
there
not
a
touch
of
pique
in
the
elaborate
irony
with
which
she
had
spoken
of
his
choice
but
it
was
idle
to
look
in
that
direction
he
was
anxious
on
his
sisters
account
they
were
clever
girls
and
with
energy
might
before
long
earn
a
bare
subsistence
but
it
began
to
be
doubtful
whether
they
would
persevere
in
literary
work
maud
it
was
clear
had
conceived
hopes
of
quite
another
kind
her
intimacy
with
mrs
lane
was
effecting
a
change
in
her
habits
her
dress
even
her
modes
of
speech
a
few
days
after
their
establishment
in
the
new
lodgings
jasper
spoke
seriously
on
this
subject
with
the
younger
girl
i
wonder
whether
you
could
satisfy
my
curiosity
in
a
certain
matter
he
said
do
you
by
chance
know
how
much
maud
gave
for
that
new
jacket
in
which
i
saw
her
yesterday
dora
was
reluctant
to
answer
i
don
t
think
it
was
very
that
is
to
say
it
didn
t
cost
twenty
guineas
well
i
hope
not
i
notice
too
that
she
has
been
purchasing
a
new
oh
that
was
very
inexpensive
she
trimmed
it
did
she
is
there
any
particular
any
quite
special
reason
for
this
expenditure
i
really
can
t
say
that
s
ambiguous
you
know
perhaps
it
means
you
won
t
allow
yourself
to
say
no
maud
doesn
t
tell
me
about
things
of
that
he
took
opportunities
of
investigating
the
matter
with
the
result
that
some
ten
days
after
he
sought
private
colloquy
with
maud
herself
she
had
asked
his
opinion
of
a
little
paper
she
was
going
to
send
to
a
ladies
illustrated
weekly
and
he
summoned
her
to
his
own
room
i
think
this
will
do
pretty
well
he
said
there
s
rather
too
much
thought
in
it
perhaps
suppose
you
knock
out
one
or
two
of
the
less
obvious
reflections
and
substitute
a
wholesome
commonplace
you
ll
have
a
better
chance
i
assure
but
i
shall
make
it
no
you
ll
probably
make
it
worth
a
guinea
or
so
you
must
remember
that
the
people
who
read
women
s
papers
are
irritated
simply
irritated
by
anything
that
isn
t
glaringly
obvious
they
hate
an
unusual
thought
the
art
of
writing
for
such
papers
indeed
for
the
public
in
general
is
to
express
vulgar
thought
and
feeling
in
a
way
that
flatters
the
vulgar
thinkers
and
feelers
just
abandon
your
mind
to
it
and
then
let
me
see
it
maud
took
up
the
manuscript
and
glanced
over
it
with
a
contemptuous
smile
having
observed
her
for
a
moment
jasper
threw
himself
back
in
the
chair
and
said
as
if
casually
i
am
told
that
mr
dolomore
is
becoming
a
great
friend
of
the
girl
s
face
changed
she
drew
herself
up
and
looked
away
towards
the
window
i
don
t
know
that
he
is
a
great
still
he
pays
enough
attention
to
you
to
excite
whose
remark
that
of
several
people
who
go
to
mrs
lane
i
don
t
know
any
reason
for
it
said
maud
coldly
look
here
maud
you
don
t
mind
if
i
give
you
a
friendly
warning
she
kept
silence
with
a
look
of
superiority
to
all
monition
dolomore
pursued
her
brother
is
all
very
well
in
his
way
but
that
way
isn
t
yours
i
believe
he
has
a
good
deal
of
money
but
he
has
neither
brains
nor
principle
there
s
no
harm
in
your
observing
the
nature
and
habits
of
such
individuals
but
don
t
allow
yourself
to
forget
that
they
are
altogether
beneath
there
s
no
need
whatever
for
you
to
teach
me
replied
the
girl
i
m
quite
sure
of
that
but
you
are
inexperienced
on
the
whole
i
do
rather
wish
that
you
would
go
less
frequently
to
mrs
lane
s
it
was
rather
an
unfortunate
choice
of
yours
very
much
better
if
you
could
have
got
on
a
good
footing
with
the
barnabys
if
you
are
generally
looked
upon
as
belonging
to
the
lanes
set
it
will
make
it
difficult
for
you
to
get
in
with
the
better
maud
was
not
to
be
drawn
into
argument
and
jasper
could
only
hope
that
his
words
would
have
some
weight
with
her
the
mr
dolomore
in
question
was
a
young
man
of
rather
offensive
type
athletic
dandiacal
and
it
astonished
jasper
that
his
sister
could
tolerate
such
an
empty
creature
for
a
moment
who
has
not
felt
the
like
surprise
with
regard
to
women
s
inclinations
he
talked
with
dora
about
it
but
she
was
not
in
her
sister
s
confidence
i
think
you
ought
to
have
some
influence
with
her
jasper
said
maud
won
t
allow
anyone
to
interfere
in
her
private
it
would
be
unfortunate
if
she
made
me
quarrel
with
oh
surely
there
isn
t
any
danger
of
that
i
don
t
know
she
mustn
t
be
jasper
himself
saw
a
good
deal
of
miscellaneous
society
at
this
time
he
could
not
work
so
persistently
as
usual
and
with
wise
tactics
he
used
the
seasons
of
enforced
leisure
to
extend
his
acquaintance
marian
and
he
were
together
twice
a
week
in
the
evening
of
his
old
bohemian
associates
he
kept
up
intimate
relations
with
one
only
and
that
was
whelpdale
this
was
in
a
measure
obligatory
for
whelpdale
frequently
came
to
see
him
and
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
repel
a
man
who
was
always
making
known
how
highly
he
esteemed
the
privilege
of
milvain
s
friendship
and
whose
company
on
the
whole
was
agreeable
enough
at
the
present
juncture
whelpdale
s
cheery
flattery
was
a
distinct
assistance
it
helped
to
support
jasper
in
his
and
to
keep
the
brightest
complexion
on
the
prospect
to
which
he
had
committed
himself
whelpdale
is
anxious
to
make
marian
s
acquaintance
jasper
said
to
his
sisters
one
day
shall
we
have
him
here
tomorrow
evening
just
as
you
like
maud
replied
you
won
t
object
dora
oh
no
i
rather
like
mr
if
i
were
to
repeat
that
to
him
he
d
go
wild
with
delight
but
don
t
be
afraid
i
shan
t
i
ll
ask
him
to
come
for
an
hour
and
trust
to
his
discretion
not
to
bore
us
by
staying
too
a
note
was
posted
to
whelpdale
he
was
invited
to
present
himself
at
eight
o
clock
by
which
time
marian
would
have
arrived
jasper
s
room
was
to
be
the
scene
of
the
assembly
and
punctual
to
the
minute
the
literary
adviser
appeared
he
was
dressed
with
all
the
finish
his
wardrobe
allowed
and
his
face
beamed
with
gratification
it
was
rapture
to
him
to
enter
the
presence
of
these
three
girls
one
of
whom
he
had
held
in
romantic
remembrance
since
his
one
meeting
with
her
at
jasper
s
old
lodgings
his
eyes
melted
with
tenderness
as
he
approached
dora
and
saw
her
smile
of
gracious
recognition
by
maud
he
was
profoundly
impressed
marian
inspired
him
with
no
awe
but
he
fully
appreciated
the
charm
of
her
features
and
her
modest
gravity
after
all
it
was
to
dora
that
his
eyes
turned
again
most
naturally
he
thought
her
exquisite
and
rather
than
be
long
without
a
glimpse
of
her
he
contented
himself
with
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
hem
of
her
dress
and
the
that
occasionally
peeped
from
beneath
it
as
was
to
be
expected
in
such
a
circle
conversation
soon
turned
to
the
subject
of
literary
struggles
i
always
feel
it
rather
humiliating
said
jasper
that
i
have
gone
through
no
very
serious
hardships
it
must
be
so
gratifying
to
say
to
young
fellows
who
are
just
beginning
ah
i
remember
when
i
was
within
an
ace
of
starving
to
death
and
then
come
out
with
grub
street
reminiscences
of
the
most
appalling
kind
unfortunately
i
have
always
had
enough
to
i
haven
t
exclaimed
whelpdale
i
have
lived
for
five
days
on
a
few
cents
worth
of
in
the
what
are
mr
whelpdale
asked
dora
delighted
with
the
question
whelpdale
described
that
undesirable
species
of
food
it
was
in
troy
he
went
on
troy
to
think
that
a
man
should
live
on
in
a
town
called
troy
tell
us
those
adventures
cried
jasper
it
s
a
long
time
since
i
heard
them
and
the
girls
will
enjoy
it
dora
looked
at
him
with
such
interest
that
the
traveller
needed
no
further
persuasion
it
came
to
pass
in
those
days
he
began
that
i
inherited
from
my
godfather
a
small
a
very
small
sum
of
money
i
was
making
strenuous
efforts
to
write
for
magazines
with
absolutely
no
encouragement
as
everybody
was
talking
just
then
of
the
centennial
exhibition
at
philadelphia
i
conceived
the
brilliant
idea
of
crossing
the
atlantic
in
the
hope
that
i
might
find
valuable
literary
material
at
the
exhibition
or
exposition
as
they
called
it
and
elsewhere
i
won
t
trouble
you
with
an
account
of
how
i
lived
whilst
i
still
had
money
sufficient
that
no
one
would
accept
the
articles
i
sent
to
england
and
that
at
last
i
got
into
perilous
straits
i
went
to
new
york
and
thought
of
returning
home
but
the
spirit
of
adventure
was
strong
in
me
i
ll
go
west
i
said
to
myself
there
i
am
bound
to
find
and
go
i
did
taking
an
emigrant
ticket
to
chicago
it
was
december
and
i
should
like
you
to
imagine
what
a
journey
of
a
thousand
miles
by
an
emigrant
train
meant
at
that
season
the
cars
were
deadly
cold
and
what
with
that
and
the
hardness
of
the
seats
i
found
it
impossible
to
sleep
it
reminded
me
of
tortures
i
had
read
about
i
thought
my
brain
would
have
burst
with
the
need
of
sleeping
at
cleveland
in
ohio
we
had
to
wait
several
hours
in
the
night
i
left
the
station
and
wandered
about
till
i
found
myself
on
the
edge
of
a
great
cliff
that
looked
over
lake
erie
a
magnificent
picture
brilliant
moonlight
and
all
the
lake
away
to
the
horizon
frozen
and
covered
with
snow
the
clocks
struck
two
as
i
stood
he
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
servant
who
brought
coffee
nothing
could
be
more
welcome
cried
dora
mr
whelpdale
makes
one
feel
quite
there
was
laughter
and
chatting
whilst
maud
poured
out
the
beverage
then
whelpdale
pursued
his
narrative
i
reached
chicago
with
not
quite
five
dollars
in
my
pockets
and
with
a
courage
which
i
now
marvel
at
i
paid
immediately
four
dollars
and
a
half
for
a
week
s
board
and
lodging
well
i
said
to
myself
for
a
week
i
am
safe
if
i
earn
nothing
in
that
time
at
least
i
shall
owe
nothing
when
i
have
to
turn
out
into
the
it
was
a
rather
dirty
little
in
wabash
avenue
and
occupied
as
i
soon
found
almost
entirely
by
actors
there
was
no
fireplace
in
my
bedroom
and
if
there
had
been
i
couldn
t
have
afforded
a
fire
but
that
mattered
little
what
i
had
to
do
was
to
set
forth
and
discover
some
way
of
making
money
don
t
suppose
that
i
was
in
a
desperate
state
of
mind
how
it
was
i
don
t
quite
know
but
i
felt
decidedly
cheerful
it
was
pleasant
to
be
in
this
new
region
of
the
earth
and
i
went
about
the
town
like
a
tourist
who
has
abundant
he
sipped
his
coffee
i
saw
nothing
for
it
but
to
apply
at
the
office
of
some
newspaper
and
as
i
happened
to
light
upon
the
biggest
of
them
first
of
all
i
put
on
a
bold
face
marched
in
asked
if
i
could
see
the
editor
there
was
no
difficulty
whatever
about
this
i
was
told
to
ascend
by
means
of
the
elevator
to
an
upper
storey
and
there
i
walked
into
a
comfortable
little
room
where
a
youngish
man
sat
smoking
a
cigar
at
a
table
covered
with
print
and
manuscript
i
introduced
myself
stated
my
business
can
you
give
me
work
of
any
kind
on
your
paper
well
what
experience
have
you
had
none
the
editor
smiled
i
m
very
much
afraid
you
would
be
no
use
to
us
but
what
do
you
think
you
could
do
well
now
there
was
but
one
thing
that
by
any
possibility
i
could
do
i
asked
him
do
you
publish
any
fiction
short
stories
yes
we
re
always
glad
of
a
short
story
if
it
s
this
was
a
big
daily
paper
they
have
weekly
supplements
of
all
conceivable
kinds
of
matter
well
i
said
if
i
write
a
story
of
english
life
will
you
consider
it
with
i
left
him
and
went
out
as
if
my
existence
were
henceforth
provided
he
laughed
heartily
and
was
joined
by
his
hearers
it
was
a
great
thing
to
be
permitted
to
write
a
story
but
then
what
story
i
went
down
to
the
shore
of
lake
michigan
walked
there
for
half
an
hour
in
an
icy
wind
then
i
looked
for
a
stationer
s
shop
and
laid
out
a
few
of
my
remaining
cents
in
the
purchase
of
pen
ink
and
paper
my
stock
of
all
these
things
was
at
an
end
when
i
left
new
york
then
back
to
the
impossible
to
write
in
my
bedroom
the
temperature
was
below
zero
there
was
no
choice
but
to
sit
down
in
the
common
room
a
place
like
the
of
a
poor
commercial
hotel
in
england
a
dozen
men
were
gathered
about
the
fire
smoking
talking
quarrelling
favourable
conditions
you
see
for
literary
effort
but
the
story
had
to
be
written
and
write
it
i
did
sitting
there
at
the
end
of
a
deal
table
i
finished
it
in
less
than
a
couple
of
days
a
good
long
story
enough
to
fill
three
columns
of
the
huge
paper
i
stand
amazed
at
my
power
of
concentration
as
often
as
i
think
of
it
and
was
it
accepted
asked
dora
you
shall
hear
i
took
my
manuscript
to
the
editor
and
he
told
me
to
come
and
see
him
again
next
morning
i
didn
t
forget
the
appointment
as
i
entered
he
smiled
in
a
very
promising
way
and
said
i
think
your
story
will
do
i
ll
put
it
into
the
saturday
supplement
call
on
saturday
morning
and
i
ll
remunerate
how
well
i
remember
that
word
remunerate
i
have
had
an
affection
for
the
word
ever
since
and
remunerate
me
he
did
scribbled
something
on
a
scrap
of
paper
which
i
presented
to
the
cashier
the
sum
was
eighteen
dollars
behold
me
saved
he
sipped
his
coffee
again
i
have
never
come
across
an
english
editor
who
treated
me
with
anything
like
that
consideration
and
general
kindliness
how
the
man
had
time
in
his
position
to
see
me
so
often
and
do
things
in
such
a
human
way
i
can
t
understand
imagine
anyone
trying
the
same
at
the
office
of
a
london
newspaper
to
begin
with
one
couldn
t
see
the
editor
at
all
i
shall
always
think
with
profound
gratitude
of
that
man
with
the
peaked
brown
beard
and
pleasant
but
did
the
come
after
that
inquired
dora
alas
they
did
for
some
months
i
supported
myself
in
chicago
writing
for
that
same
paper
and
for
others
but
at
length
the
flow
of
my
inspiration
was
checked
i
had
written
myself
out
and
i
began
to
grow
wanted
to
get
back
to
england
the
result
was
that
i
found
myself
one
day
in
new
york
again
but
without
money
enough
to
pay
for
a
passage
home
i
tried
to
write
one
more
story
but
it
happened
as
i
was
looking
over
newspapers
in
a
that
i
saw
one
of
my
chicago
tales
copied
into
a
paper
published
at
troy
now
troy
was
not
very
far
off
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
i
went
there
the
editor
of
this
paper
might
be
disposed
to
employ
me
seeing
he
had
a
taste
for
my
fiction
and
i
went
up
the
hudson
by
steamboat
on
landing
at
troy
i
was
as
badly
off
as
when
i
reached
chicago
i
had
less
than
a
dollar
and
the
worst
of
it
was
i
had
come
on
a
vain
errand
the
editor
treated
me
with
scant
courtesy
and
no
work
was
to
be
got
i
took
a
little
room
paying
for
it
day
by
day
and
in
the
meantime
i
fed
on
those
loathsome
buying
a
handful
in
the
street
now
and
then
and
i
assure
you
i
looked
starvation
in
the
what
sort
of
a
town
is
troy
asked
marian
speaking
for
the
first
time
don
t
ask
me
they
make
straw
hats
there
principally
and
they
sell
more
i
remember
but
you
didn
t
starve
to
death
said
maud
no
i
just
didn
t
i
went
one
afternoon
into
a
lawyer
s
office
thinking
i
might
get
some
copying
work
and
there
i
found
an
old
man
sitting
with
an
open
bible
on
his
knees
he
explained
to
me
that
he
wasn
t
the
lawyer
that
the
lawyer
was
away
on
business
and
that
he
was
just
guarding
the
office
well
could
he
help
me
he
meditated
and
a
thought
occurred
to
him
go
he
said
to
a
and
ask
for
mr
freeman
sterling
he
is
just
starting
on
a
business
tour
and
wants
a
young
man
to
accompany
i
didn
t
dream
of
asking
what
the
business
was
but
sped
as
fast
as
my
trembling
limbs
would
carry
me
to
the
address
he
had
mentioned
i
asked
for
mr
freeman
sterling
and
found
him
he
was
a
photographer
and
his
business
at
present
was
to
go
about
getting
orders
for
the
reproducing
of
old
portraits
a
young
fellow
he
said
he
liked
the
look
of
me
and
on
the
spot
engaged
me
to
assist
him
in
a
visitation
he
would
pay
for
my
board
and
lodging
and
give
me
a
commission
on
all
the
orders
i
obtained
forthwith
i
sat
down
to
a
square
meal
and
ate
my
conscience
how
i
ate
you
were
not
eminently
successful
in
that
pursuit
i
think
said
jasper
i
don
t
think
i
got
orders
yet
that
good
samaritan
supported
me
for
five
or
six
weeks
whilst
we
travelled
from
troy
to
boston
it
couldn
t
go
on
i
was
ashamed
of
myself
at
last
i
told
him
that
we
must
part
upon
my
word
i
believe
he
would
have
paid
my
expenses
for
another
month
why
i
can
t
understand
but
he
had
a
vast
respect
for
me
because
i
had
written
in
newspapers
and
i
do
seriously
think
that
he
didn
t
like
to
tell
me
i
was
a
useless
fellow
we
parted
on
the
very
best
of
terms
in
and
you
again
had
recourse
to
asked
dora
well
no
in
the
meantime
i
had
written
to
someone
in
england
begging
the
loan
of
just
enough
money
to
enable
me
to
get
home
the
money
came
a
day
after
i
had
seen
sterling
off
by
an
hour
and
a
half
quickly
passed
and
jasper
who
wished
to
have
a
few
minutes
of
marian
s
company
before
it
was
time
for
her
to
go
cast
a
significant
glance
at
his
sisters
dora
said
innocently
you
wished
me
to
tell
you
when
it
was
nine
and
marian
rose
this
was
a
signal
whelpdale
could
not
disregard
immediately
he
made
ready
for
his
own
departure
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
was
gone
his
face
at
the
last
moment
expressing
blended
delight
and
pain
too
good
of
you
to
have
asked
me
to
come
he
said
with
gratitude
to
jasper
who
went
to
the
door
with
him
you
are
a
happy
man
by
jove
a
happy
man
when
jasper
returned
to
the
room
his
sisters
had
vanished
marian
stood
by
the
fire
he
drew
near
to
her
took
her
hands
and
repeated
laughingly
whelpdale
s
last
words
is
it
true
she
asked
tolerably
true
i
then
i
am
as
happy
as
you
he
released
her
hands
and
moved
a
little
apart
marian
i
have
been
thinking
about
that
letter
to
your
father
i
had
better
get
it
written
don
t
you
think
she
gazed
at
him
with
troubled
eyes
perhaps
you
had
though
we
said
it
might
be
delayed
until
yes
i
know
but
i
suspect
you
had
rather
i
didn
t
wait
any
longer
isn
t
that
the
truth
partly
do
just
as
you
wish
i
ll
go
and
see
him
if
you
i
am
so
afraid
no
writing
will
be
very
well
then
he
shall
have
the
letter
don
t
let
it
come
before
the
last
post
i
had
so
much
rather
not
manage
it
if
you
very
well
now
go
and
say
to
the
girls
it
s
a
vile
night
and
you
must
get
home
as
soon
as
she
turned
away
but
again
came
towards
him
murmuring
just
a
word
or
two
about
the
letter
no
you
haven
t
said
he
laughed
and
you
couldn
t
go
away
contentedly
unless
i
repeated
for
the
hundredth
time
that
i
love
you
marian
searched
his
countenance
do
you
think
it
foolish
i
live
only
on
those
well
they
are
better
than
oh
don
t
i
can
t
bear
to
jasper
was
unable
to
understand
that
such
a
jest
sounded
to
her
like
profanity
she
hid
her
face
against
him
and
whispered
the
words
that
would
have
enraptured
her
had
they
but
come
from
his
lips
the
young
man
found
it
pleasant
enough
to
be
worshipped
but
he
could
not
reply
as
she
desired
a
few
phrases
of
tenderness
and
his
was
exhausted
he
even
grew
weary
when
something
more
the
indefinite
something
was
vaguely
required
of
him
you
are
a
dear
good
girl
he
said
stroking
her
short
soft
hair
which
was
exquisite
to
the
hand
now
go
and
get
she
left
him
but
stood
for
a
few
moments
on
the
landing
before
going
to
the
girls
room
chapter
xxix
catastrophe
marian
had
finished
the
rough
draft
of
a
paper
on
james
harrington
author
of
her
father
went
through
it
by
the
midnight
lamp
and
the
next
morning
made
his
comments
a
black
sky
and
sooty
rain
strengthened
his
inclination
to
sit
by
the
study
fire
and
talk
at
large
in
a
tone
of
flattering
benignity
those
paragraphs
on
the
rota
club
strike
me
as
singularly
happy
he
said
tapping
the
manuscript
with
the
mouthpiece
of
his
pipe
perhaps
you
might
say
a
word
or
two
more
about
cyriac
skinner
one
mustn
t
be
too
allusive
with
general
readers
their
ignorance
is
incredible
but
there
is
so
little
to
add
to
this
paper
so
little
to
alter
that
i
couldn
t
feel
justified
in
sending
it
as
my
own
work
i
think
it
is
altogether
too
good
to
appear
anonymously
you
must
sign
it
marian
and
have
the
credit
that
is
due
to
oh
do
you
think
it
s
worth
while
answered
the
girl
who
was
far
from
easy
under
this
praise
of
late
there
had
been
too
much
of
it
it
made
her
regard
her
father
with
suspicions
which
increased
her
sense
of
trouble
in
keeping
a
momentous
secret
from
him
yes
yes
you
had
better
sign
it
i
ll
undertake
there
s
no
other
girl
of
your
age
who
could
turn
out
such
a
piece
of
work
i
think
we
may
fairly
say
that
your
apprenticeship
is
at
an
end
before
long
he
smiled
anxiously
i
may
be
counting
upon
you
as
a
valued
contributor
and
that
reminds
me
would
you
be
disposed
to
call
with
me
on
the
jedwoods
at
their
house
next
sunday
marian
understood
the
intention
that
lay
beneath
this
proposal
she
saw
that
her
father
would
not
allow
himself
to
seem
discouraged
by
the
silence
she
maintained
on
the
great
subject
which
awaited
her
decision
he
was
endeavouring
gradually
to
involve
her
in
his
ambitions
to
carry
her
forward
by
insensible
steps
it
pained
her
to
observe
the
suppressed
eagerness
with
which
he
looked
for
her
reply
i
will
go
if
you
wish
father
but
i
had
rather
i
feel
sure
you
would
like
mrs
jedwood
one
has
no
great
opinion
of
her
novels
but
she
is
a
woman
of
some
intellect
let
me
book
you
for
next
sunday
surely
i
have
a
claim
to
your
companionship
now
and
marian
kept
silence
yule
puffed
at
his
pipe
then
said
with
a
speculative
air
i
suppose
it
has
never
even
occurred
to
you
to
try
your
hand
at
fiction
i
haven
t
the
least
inclination
that
you
would
probably
do
something
rather
good
if
you
tried
but
i
don
t
urge
it
my
own
efforts
in
that
line
were
a
mistake
i
m
disposed
to
think
not
that
the
things
were
worse
than
multitudes
of
books
which
nowadays
go
down
with
the
but
i
never
quite
knew
what
i
wished
to
be
at
in
fiction
i
wasn
t
content
to
write
a
mere
narrative
of
the
exciting
kind
yet
i
couldn
t
hit
upon
subjects
of
intellectual
cast
that
altogether
satisfied
me
well
well
i
have
tried
my
hand
at
most
kinds
of
literature
assuredly
i
merit
the
title
of
man
of
you
certainly
what
should
you
think
of
that
title
for
a
review
letters
it
has
never
been
used
so
far
as
i
know
i
like
the
word
how
much
better
a
man
of
letters
than
a
literary
man
and
apropos
of
that
when
was
the
word
literature
first
used
in
our
modern
sense
to
signify
a
body
of
writing
in
johnson
s
day
it
was
pretty
much
the
equivalent
of
our
you
remember
his
saying
it
is
surprising
how
little
literature
people
his
dictionary
i
believe
defines
the
word
as
learning
skill
in
letters
nothing
it
was
characteristic
of
yule
to
dwell
with
gusto
on
little
points
such
as
this
he
prosed
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
a
pause
every
now
and
then
whilst
he
kept
his
pipe
alight
i
think
letters
wouldn
t
be
amiss
he
said
at
length
returning
to
the
suggestion
which
he
wished
to
keep
before
marian
s
mind
it
would
clearly
indicate
our
scope
no
articles
on
bimetallism
as
quarmby
said
wasn
t
it
quarmby
he
laughed
idly
yes
i
must
ask
jedwood
how
he
likes
the
though
marian
feared
the
result
she
was
glad
when
jasper
made
up
his
mind
to
write
to
her
father
since
it
was
determined
that
her
money
could
not
be
devoted
to
establishing
a
review
the
truth
ought
to
be
confessed
before
yule
had
gone
too
far
in
nursing
his
dangerous
hope
without
the
support
of
her
love
and
all
the
prospects
connected
with
it
she
would
hardly
have
been
capable
of
giving
a
distinct
refusal
when
her
reply
could
no
longer
be
postponed
to
hold
the
money
merely
for
her
own
benefit
would
have
seemed
to
her
too
selfish
however
slight
her
faith
in
the
project
on
which
her
father
built
so
exultantly
when
it
was
declared
that
she
had
accepted
an
offer
of
marriage
a
sacrifice
of
that
kind
could
no
longer
be
expected
of
her
opposition
must
direct
itself
against
the
choice
she
had
made
it
would
be
stern
perhaps
relentless
but
she
felt
able
to
face
any
extremity
of
wrath
her
nerves
quivered
but
in
her
heart
was
an
exhaustless
source
of
courage
that
a
change
had
somehow
come
about
in
the
girl
yule
was
aware
he
observed
her
with
the
closest
study
day
after
day
her
health
seemed
to
have
improved
after
a
long
spell
of
work
she
had
not
the
air
of
despondent
weariness
which
had
sometimes
irritated
him
sometimes
made
him
uneasy
she
was
more
womanly
in
her
bearing
and
speech
and
exercised
an
independence
appropriate
indeed
to
her
years
but
such
as
had
not
formerly
declared
itself
the
question
with
her
father
was
whether
these
things
resulted
simply
from
her
consciousness
of
possessing
what
to
her
seemed
wealth
or
something
else
had
happened
of
the
nature
that
he
dreaded
an
alarming
symptom
was
the
increased
attention
she
paid
to
her
personal
appearance
its
indications
were
not
at
all
prominent
but
yule
on
the
watch
for
such
things
did
not
overlook
them
true
this
also
might
mean
nothing
but
a
sense
of
relief
from
narrow
means
a
girl
would
naturally
adorn
herself
a
little
under
the
circumstances
his
doubts
came
to
an
end
two
days
after
that
proposal
of
a
title
for
the
new
review
as
he
sat
in
his
study
the
servant
brought
him
a
letter
delivered
by
the
last
evening
post
the
handwriting
was
unknown
to
him
the
contents
were
these
dear
mr
yule
it
is
my
desire
to
write
to
you
with
perfect
frankness
and
as
simply
as
i
can
on
a
subject
which
has
the
deepest
interest
for
me
and
which
i
trust
you
will
consider
in
that
spirit
of
kindness
with
which
you
received
me
when
we
first
met
at
finden
on
the
occasion
of
that
meeting
i
had
the
happiness
of
being
presented
to
miss
yule
she
was
not
totally
a
stranger
to
me
at
that
time
i
used
to
work
pretty
regularly
in
the
museum
and
there
i
had
seen
miss
yule
had
ventured
to
observe
her
at
moments
with
a
young
man
s
attention
and
had
felt
my
interest
aroused
though
i
did
not
know
her
name
to
find
her
at
finden
seemed
to
me
a
very
unusual
and
delightful
piece
of
good
fortune
when
i
came
back
from
my
holiday
i
was
conscious
of
a
new
purpose
in
life
a
new
desire
and
a
new
motive
to
help
me
on
in
my
chosen
career
my
mother
s
death
led
to
my
sisters
coming
to
live
in
london
already
there
had
been
friendly
correspondence
between
miss
yule
and
the
two
girls
and
now
that
the
opportunity
offered
they
began
to
see
each
other
frequently
as
i
was
often
at
my
sisters
lodgings
it
came
about
that
i
met
miss
yule
there
from
time
to
time
in
this
way
was
confirmed
my
attachment
to
your
daughter
the
better
i
knew
her
the
more
worthy
i
found
her
of
reverence
and
love
would
it
not
have
been
natural
for
me
to
seek
a
renewal
of
the
acquaintance
with
yourself
which
had
been
begun
in
the
country
gladly
i
should
have
done
so
before
my
sisters
coming
to
london
i
did
call
one
day
at
your
house
with
the
desire
of
seeing
you
but
unfortunately
you
were
not
at
home
very
soon
after
that
i
learnt
to
my
extreme
regret
that
my
connection
with
the
current
and
its
editor
would
make
any
repetition
of
my
visit
very
distasteful
to
you
i
was
conscious
of
nothing
in
my
literary
life
that
could
justly
offend
you
and
at
this
day
i
can
say
the
same
but
i
shrank
from
the
appearance
of
importunity
and
for
some
months
i
was
deeply
distressed
by
the
fear
that
what
i
most
desired
in
life
had
become
unattainable
my
means
were
very
slight
i
had
no
choice
but
to
take
such
work
as
offered
and
mere
chance
had
put
me
into
a
position
which
threatened
ruin
to
the
hope
that
you
would
some
day
regard
me
as
a
not
unworthy
suitor
for
your
daughter
s
hand
circumstances
have
led
me
to
a
step
which
at
that
time
seemed
impossible
having
discovered
that
miss
yule
returned
the
feeling
i
entertained
for
her
i
have
asked
her
to
be
my
wife
and
she
has
consented
it
is
now
my
hope
that
you
will
permit
me
to
call
upon
you
miss
yule
is
aware
that
i
am
writing
this
letter
will
you
not
let
her
plead
for
me
seeing
that
only
by
an
unhappy
chance
have
i
been
kept
aloof
from
you
marian
and
i
are
equally
desirous
that
you
should
approve
our
union
without
that
approval
indeed
something
will
be
lacking
to
the
happiness
for
which
we
hope
believe
me
to
be
sincerely
yours
jasper
half
an
hour
after
reading
this
yule
was
roused
from
a
fit
of
the
gloomiest
brooding
by
marian
s
entrance
she
came
towards
him
timidly
with
pale
countenance
he
had
glanced
round
to
see
who
it
was
but
at
once
turned
his
head
again
will
you
forgive
me
for
keeping
this
secret
from
you
father
forgive
you
he
replied
in
a
hard
deliberate
voice
i
assure
you
it
is
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
me
you
are
long
since
of
age
and
i
have
no
power
whatever
to
prevent
your
falling
a
victim
to
any
schemer
who
takes
your
fancy
it
would
be
folly
in
me
to
discuss
the
question
i
recognise
your
right
to
have
as
many
secrets
as
may
seem
good
to
you
to
talk
of
forgiveness
is
the
merest
no
i
spoke
sincerely
if
it
had
seemed
possible
i
should
gladly
have
let
you
know
about
this
from
the
first
that
would
have
been
natural
and
right
but
you
know
what
prevented
i
do
i
will
try
to
hope
that
even
a
sense
of
shame
had
something
to
do
with
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
said
marian
coldly
i
have
never
had
reason
to
feel
be
it
so
i
trust
you
may
never
have
reason
to
feel
repentance
may
i
ask
when
you
propose
to
be
married
i
don
t
know
when
it
will
take
as
soon
i
suppose
as
your
uncle
s
executors
have
discharged
a
piece
of
business
which
is
distinctly
germane
to
the
matter
does
your
mother
know
i
have
just
told
very
well
then
it
seems
to
me
that
there
s
nothing
more
to
be
do
you
refuse
to
see
mr
milvain
most
decidedly
i
do
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
inform
him
that
that
is
my
reply
to
his
i
don
t
think
that
is
the
behaviour
of
a
gentleman
said
marian
her
eyes
beginning
to
gleam
with
resentment
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
your
will
you
tell
me
father
in
plain
words
why
you
dislike
mr
milvain
i
am
not
inclined
to
repeat
what
i
have
already
fruitlessly
told
you
for
the
sake
of
a
clear
understanding
however
i
will
let
you
know
the
practical
result
of
my
dislike
from
the
day
of
your
marriage
with
that
man
you
are
nothing
to
me
i
shall
distinctly
forbid
you
to
enter
my
house
you
make
your
choice
and
go
your
own
way
i
shall
hope
never
to
see
your
face
their
eyes
met
and
the
look
of
each
seemed
to
fascinate
the
other
if
you
have
made
up
your
mind
to
that
said
marian
in
a
shaking
voice
i
can
remain
here
no
longer
such
words
are
senselessly
cruel
i
shall
leave
the
i
repeat
that
you
are
of
age
and
perfectly
independent
it
can
be
nothing
to
me
how
soon
you
go
you
have
given
proof
that
i
am
of
less
than
no
account
to
you
and
doubtless
the
sooner
we
cease
to
afflict
each
other
the
it
seemed
as
if
the
effect
of
these
conflicts
with
her
father
were
to
develop
in
marian
a
vehemence
of
temper
which
at
length
matched
that
of
which
yule
was
the
victim
her
face
outlined
to
express
a
gentle
gravity
was
now
haughtily
passionate
nostrils
and
lips
thrilled
with
wrath
and
her
eyes
were
magnificent
in
their
dark
fieriness
you
shall
not
need
to
tell
me
that
again
she
answered
and
immediately
left
him
she
went
into
the
where
mrs
yule
was
awaiting
the
result
of
the
interview
mother
she
said
with
stern
gentleness
this
house
can
no
longer
be
a
home
for
me
i
shall
go
away
and
live
in
lodgings
until
the
time
of
my
mrs
yule
uttered
a
cry
of
pain
and
started
up
oh
don
t
do
that
marian
what
has
he
said
to
you
come
and
talk
to
me
darling
tell
me
what
he
s
said
don
t
look
like
that
she
clung
to
the
girl
despairingly
terrified
by
a
transformation
she
would
have
thought
impossible
he
says
that
if
i
marry
mr
milvain
he
hopes
never
to
see
my
face
again
i
can
t
stay
here
you
shall
come
and
see
me
and
we
will
be
the
same
to
each
other
as
always
but
father
has
treated
me
too
unjustly
i
can
t
live
near
him
after
he
doesn
t
mean
it
sobbed
her
mother
he
says
what
he
s
sorry
for
as
soon
as
the
words
are
spoken
he
loves
you
too
much
my
darling
to
drive
you
away
like
that
it
s
his
disappointment
marian
that
s
all
it
is
he
counted
on
it
so
much
i
ve
heard
him
talk
of
it
in
his
sleep
he
made
so
sure
that
he
was
going
to
have
that
new
magazine
and
the
disappointment
makes
him
that
he
doesn
t
know
what
he
s
saying
only
wait
and
see
he
ll
tell
you
he
didn
t
mean
it
i
know
he
will
only
leave
him
alone
till
he
s
had
time
to
get
over
it
do
forgive
him
this
it
s
like
a
madman
to
talk
in
that
way
said
the
girl
releasing
herself
whatever
his
disappointment
i
can
t
endure
it
i
have
worked
hard
for
him
very
hard
ever
since
i
was
old
enough
and
he
owes
me
some
kindness
some
respect
it
would
be
different
if
he
had
the
least
reason
for
his
hatred
of
jasper
it
is
nothing
but
insensate
prejudice
the
result
of
his
quarrels
with
other
people
what
right
has
he
to
insult
me
by
representing
my
future
husband
as
a
scheming
hypocrite
my
love
he
has
had
so
much
to
bear
it
s
made
him
so
then
i
am
too
and
the
sooner
we
are
apart
the
better
as
he
said
oh
but
you
have
always
been
such
a
patient
my
patience
is
at
an
end
when
i
am
treated
as
if
i
had
neither
rights
nor
feelings
however
wrong
the
choice
i
had
made
this
was
not
the
way
to
behave
to
me
his
disappointment
is
there
a
natural
law
then
that
a
daughter
must
be
sacrificed
to
her
father
my
husband
will
have
as
much
need
of
that
money
as
my
father
has
and
he
will
be
able
to
make
far
better
use
of
it
it
was
wrong
even
to
ask
me
to
give
my
money
away
like
that
i
have
a
right
to
happiness
as
well
as
other
she
was
shaken
with
hysterical
passion
the
natural
consequence
of
this
outbreak
in
a
nature
such
as
hers
her
mother
in
the
meantime
grew
stronger
by
force
of
profound
love
that
at
length
had
found
its
opportunity
of
expression
presently
she
persuaded
marian
to
come
upstairs
with
her
and
before
long
the
overburdened
breast
was
relieved
by
a
flow
of
tears
but
marian
s
purpose
remained
unshaken
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
see
each
other
day
after
day
she
said
when
calmer
he
can
t
control
his
anger
against
me
and
i
suffer
too
much
when
i
am
made
to
feel
like
this
i
shall
take
a
lodging
not
far
off
where
you
can
see
me
but
you
have
no
money
marian
replied
mrs
yule
miserably
no
money
as
if
i
couldn
t
borrow
a
few
pounds
until
all
my
own
comes
to
me
dora
milvain
can
lend
me
all
i
shall
want
it
won
t
make
the
least
difference
to
her
i
must
have
my
money
very
soon
at
about
eleven
mrs
yule
went
downstairs
and
entered
the
study
if
you
are
coming
to
speak
about
marian
said
her
husband
turning
upon
her
with
savage
eyes
you
can
save
your
breath
i
won
t
hear
her
name
she
faltered
but
overcame
her
weakness
you
are
driving
her
away
from
us
alfred
it
isn
t
right
oh
it
isn
t
right
if
she
didn
t
go
i
should
so
understand
that
and
if
i
go
you
have
seen
the
last
of
me
make
your
choice
make
your
choice
he
had
yielded
himself
to
that
perverse
frenzy
which
impels
a
man
to
acts
and
utterances
most
wildly
at
conflict
with
reason
his
sense
of
the
monstrous
irrationality
to
which
he
was
committed
completed
what
was
begun
in
him
by
the
bitterness
of
a
great
frustration
if
i
wasn
t
a
poor
helpless
woman
replied
his
wife
sinking
upon
a
chair
and
crying
without
raising
her
hands
to
her
face
i
d
go
and
live
with
her
till
she
was
married
and
then
make
a
home
for
myself
but
i
haven
t
a
penny
and
i
m
too
old
to
earn
my
own
living
i
should
only
be
a
burden
to
that
shall
be
no
hindrance
cried
yule
go
by
all
means
you
shall
have
a
sufficient
allowance
as
long
as
i
can
continue
to
work
and
when
i
m
past
that
your
lot
will
be
no
harder
than
mine
your
daughter
had
the
chance
of
making
provision
for
my
old
age
at
no
expense
to
herself
but
that
was
asking
too
much
of
her
go
by
all
means
and
leave
me
to
make
what
i
can
of
the
rest
of
my
life
perhaps
i
may
save
a
few
years
still
from
the
curse
brought
upon
me
by
my
own
it
was
idle
to
address
him
mrs
yule
went
into
the
and
there
sat
weeping
for
an
hour
then
she
extinguished
the
lights
and
crept
upstairs
in
silence
yule
passed
the
night
in
the
study
towards
morning
he
slept
for
an
hour
or
two
just
long
enough
to
let
the
fire
go
out
and
to
get
thoroughly
chilled
when
he
opened
his
eyes
a
muddy
twilight
had
begun
to
show
at
the
window
the
sounds
of
a
clapping
door
within
the
house
which
had
probably
awakened
him
made
him
aware
that
the
servant
was
already
up
he
drew
up
the
blind
there
seemed
to
be
a
frost
for
the
moisture
of
last
night
had
all
disappeared
and
the
yard
upon
which
the
window
looked
was
unusually
clean
with
a
glance
at
the
black
grate
he
extinguished
his
lamp
and
went
out
into
the
passage
a
few
minutes
groping
for
his
overcoat
and
hat
and
he
left
the
house
his
purpose
was
to
warm
himself
with
a
vigorous
walk
and
at
the
same
time
to
shake
off
if
possible
the
nightmare
of
his
rage
and
hopelessness
he
had
no
distinct
feeling
with
regard
to
his
behaviour
of
the
past
evening
he
neither
justified
nor
condemned
himself
he
did
not
ask
himself
whether
marian
would
leave
her
home
or
if
her
mother
would
take
him
at
his
word
and
also
depart
these
seemed
to
be
details
which
his
brain
was
too
weary
to
consider
but
he
wished
to
be
away
from
the
wretchedness
of
his
house
and
to
let
things
go
as
they
would
whilst
he
was
absent
as
he
closed
the
front
door
he
felt
as
if
he
were
escaping
from
an
atmosphere
that
threatened
to
stifle
him
his
steps
directing
themselves
more
by
habit
than
with
any
deliberate
choice
he
walked
towards
camden
road
when
he
had
reached
camden
town
he
was
attracted
by
a
a
draught
of
the
steaming
liquid
no
matter
its
quality
would
help
his
blood
to
circulate
he
laid
down
his
penny
and
first
warmed
his
hands
by
holding
them
round
the
cup
whilst
standing
thus
he
noticed
that
the
objects
at
which
he
looked
had
a
blurred
appearance
his
eyesight
seemed
to
have
become
worse
this
morning
only
a
result
of
his
insufficient
sleep
perhaps
he
took
up
a
scrap
of
newspaper
that
lay
on
the
stall
he
could
read
it
but
one
of
his
eyes
was
certainly
weaker
than
the
other
trying
to
see
with
that
one
alone
he
found
that
everything
became
misty
he
laughed
as
if
the
threat
of
new
calamity
were
an
amusement
in
his
present
state
of
mind
and
at
the
same
moment
his
look
encountered
that
of
a
man
who
had
drawn
near
to
him
a
man
of
middle
age
whose
face
did
not
correspond
with
his
attire
will
you
give
me
a
cup
of
coffee
asked
the
stranger
in
a
low
voice
and
with
shamefaced
manner
it
would
be
a
great
the
accent
was
that
of
good
breeding
yule
hesitated
in
surprise
for
a
moment
then
said
have
one
by
all
means
would
you
care
for
anything
to
eat
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
i
think
i
should
be
none
the
worse
for
one
of
those
solid
slices
of
bread
and
the
was
just
extinguishing
his
lights
the
frosty
sky
showed
a
pale
gleam
of
sunrise
hard
times
i
m
afraid
remarked
yule
as
his
beneficiary
began
to
eat
the
luncheon
with
much
appearance
of
grateful
appetite
very
hard
he
had
a
small
thin
colourless
countenance
with
large
pathetic
eyes
a
slight
moustache
and
curly
beard
his
clothes
were
such
as
would
be
worn
by
some
very
poor
clerk
i
came
here
an
hour
ago
he
continued
with
the
hope
of
meeting
an
acquaintance
who
generally
goes
from
this
station
at
a
certain
time
i
have
missed
him
and
in
doing
so
i
missed
what
i
had
thought
my
one
chance
of
a
breakfast
when
one
has
neither
dined
nor
supped
on
the
previous
day
breakfast
becomes
a
meal
of
some
true
take
another
i
am
greatly
obliged
to
not
at
all
i
have
known
hard
times
myself
and
am
likely
to
know
i
trust
not
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
positively
begged
i
should
have
been
too
much
ashamed
to
beg
of
the
kind
of
men
who
are
usually
at
these
places
they
certainly
have
no
money
to
spare
i
was
thinking
of
making
an
appeal
at
a
baker
s
shop
but
it
is
very
likely
i
should
have
been
handed
over
to
a
policeman
indeed
i
don
t
know
what
i
should
have
done
the
last
point
of
endurance
was
almost
reached
i
have
no
clothes
but
these
i
wear
and
they
are
few
enough
for
the
season
still
i
suppose
the
waistcoat
must
have
he
did
not
talk
like
a
beggar
who
is
trying
to
excite
compassion
but
with
a
sort
of
detached
curiosity
concerning
the
difficulties
of
his
position
you
can
find
nothing
to
do
said
the
man
of
letters
positively
nothing
by
profession
i
am
a
surgeon
but
it
s
a
long
time
since
i
practised
fifteen
years
ago
i
was
comfortably
established
at
wakefield
i
was
married
and
had
one
child
but
my
capital
ran
out
and
my
practice
never
anything
to
boast
of
fell
to
nothing
i
succeeded
in
getting
a
place
as
an
assistant
to
a
man
at
chester
we
sold
up
and
started
on
the
he
paused
looking
at
yule
in
a
strange
way
what
happened
then
you
probably
don
t
remember
a
railway
accident
that
took
place
near
crewe
in
that
year
it
was
i
and
my
wife
and
child
were
alone
in
a
carriage
that
was
splintered
one
moment
i
was
talking
with
them
in
fairly
good
spirits
and
my
wife
was
laughing
at
something
i
had
said
the
next
there
were
two
crushed
bleeding
bodies
at
my
feet
i
had
a
broken
arm
that
was
all
well
they
were
killed
on
the
instant
they
didn
t
suffer
that
has
been
my
one
yule
kept
the
silence
of
sympathy
i
was
in
a
lunatic
asylum
for
more
than
a
year
after
that
continued
the
man
unhappily
i
didn
t
lose
my
senses
at
the
moment
it
took
two
or
three
weeks
to
bring
me
to
that
pass
but
i
recovered
and
there
has
been
no
return
of
the
disease
don
t
suppose
that
i
am
still
of
unsound
mind
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
poverty
will
bring
me
to
that
again
in
the
end
but
as
yet
i
am
perfectly
sane
i
have
supported
myself
in
various
ways
no
i
don
t
drink
i
see
the
question
in
your
face
but
i
am
physically
weak
and
to
quote
mrs
gummidge
things
go
contrary
with
there
s
no
use
lamenting
this
breakfast
has
helped
me
on
and
i
feel
in
much
better
your
surgical
knowledge
is
no
use
to
you
the
other
shook
his
head
and
sighed
did
you
ever
give
any
special
attention
to
diseases
of
the
eyes
special
no
but
of
course
i
had
some
acquaintance
with
the
could
you
tell
by
examination
whether
a
man
was
threatened
with
cataract
or
anything
of
that
kind
i
think
i
i
am
speaking
of
the
stranger
made
a
close
scrutiny
of
yule
s
face
and
asked
certain
questions
with
reference
to
his
visual
sensations
i
hardly
like
to
propose
it
he
said
at
length
but
if
you
were
willing
to
accompany
me
to
a
very
poor
room
that
i
have
not
far
from
here
i
could
make
the
examination
i
will
go
with
they
turned
away
from
the
stall
and
the
led
into
a
yule
wondered
at
himself
for
caring
to
seek
such
a
singular
consultation
but
he
had
a
pressing
desire
to
hear
some
opinion
as
to
the
state
of
his
eyes
whatever
the
stranger
might
tell
him
he
would
afterwards
have
recourse
to
a
man
of
recognised
standing
but
just
now
companionship
of
any
kind
was
welcome
and
the
poor
hungry
fellow
with
his
dolorous
had
made
appeal
to
his
sympathies
to
give
money
under
guise
of
a
fee
would
be
better
than
merely
offering
alms
this
is
the
house
said
his
guide
pausing
at
a
dirty
door
it
isn
t
inviting
but
the
people
are
honest
so
far
as
i
know
my
room
is
at
the
lead
on
answered
yule
in
the
room
they
entered
was
nothing
noticeable
it
was
only
the
poorest
possible
kind
of
or
all
but
the
poorest
possible
daylight
had
now
succeeded
to
dawn
yet
the
first
thing
the
stranger
did
was
to
strike
a
match
and
light
a
candle
will
you
kindly
place
yourself
with
your
back
to
the
window
he
said
i
am
going
to
apply
what
is
called
the
catoptric
test
you
have
probably
heard
of
it
my
ignorance
of
scientific
matters
is
the
other
smiled
and
at
once
offered
a
simple
explanation
of
the
term
by
the
appearance
of
the
candle
as
it
reflected
itself
in
the
patient
s
eye
it
was
possible
he
said
to
decide
whether
cataract
had
taken
hold
upon
the
organ
for
a
minute
or
two
he
conducted
his
experiment
carefully
and
yule
was
at
no
loss
to
read
the
result
upon
his
face
how
long
have
you
suspected
that
something
was
wrong
the
surgeon
asked
as
he
put
down
the
candle
for
several
you
haven
t
consulted
anyone
no
one
i
have
kept
putting
it
off
just
tell
me
what
you
have
the
back
of
the
right
lens
is
affected
beyond
a
that
means
i
take
it
that
before
very
long
i
shall
be
practically
blind
i
don
t
like
to
speak
with
an
air
of
authority
after
all
i
am
only
a
surgeon
who
has
bungled
himself
into
pauperdom
you
must
see
a
competent
man
that
much
i
can
tell
you
in
all
earnestness
do
you
use
your
eyes
much
fourteen
hours
a
day
that
s
h
m
you
are
a
literary
man
i
think
i
am
my
name
is
alfred
he
had
some
faint
hope
that
the
name
might
be
recognised
that
would
have
gone
far
for
the
moment
to
counteract
his
trouble
but
not
even
this
poor
satisfaction
was
to
be
granted
him
to
his
hearer
the
name
evidently
conveyed
nothing
see
a
competent
man
mr
yule
science
has
advanced
rapidly
since
the
days
when
i
was
a
student
i
am
only
able
to
assure
you
of
the
existence
of
they
talked
for
half
an
hour
until
both
were
shaking
with
cold
then
yule
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
you
will
of
course
allow
me
to
offer
such
return
as
i
am
able
he
said
the
information
isn
t
pleasant
but
i
am
glad
to
have
he
laid
five
shillings
on
the
chest
of
drawers
there
was
no
table
the
stranger
expressed
his
gratitude
my
name
is
duke
he
said
and
i
was
christened
victor
possibly
because
i
was
doomed
to
defeat
in
life
i
wish
you
could
have
associated
the
memory
of
me
with
happier
they
shook
hands
and
yule
quitted
the
house
he
came
out
again
by
camden
town
station
the
had
disappeared
the
traffic
of
the
great
highway
was
growing
uproarious
among
all
the
strugglers
for
existence
who
rushed
this
way
and
that
alfred
yule
felt
himself
a
man
chosen
for
fate
s
heaviest
infliction
he
never
questioned
the
accuracy
of
the
stranger
s
judgment
and
he
hoped
for
no
mitigation
of
the
doom
it
threatened
his
life
was
over
and
wasted
he
might
as
well
go
home
and
take
his
place
meekly
by
the
fireside
he
was
beaten
soon
to
be
a
useless
old
man
a
burden
and
annoyance
to
whosoever
had
pity
on
him
it
was
a
curious
effect
of
the
imagination
that
since
coming
into
the
open
air
again
his
eyesight
seemed
to
be
far
worse
than
before
he
irritated
his
nerves
of
vision
by
incessant
tests
closing
first
one
eye
then
the
other
comparing
his
view
of
nearer
objects
with
the
appearance
of
others
more
remote
fancying
an
occasional
pain
which
could
have
had
no
connection
with
his
disease
the
literary
projects
which
had
stirred
so
actively
in
his
mind
twelve
hours
ago
were
become
an
insubstantial
memory
to
the
one
crushing
blow
had
succeeded
a
second
which
was
fatal
he
could
hardly
recall
what
special
piece
of
work
he
had
been
engaged
upon
last
night
his
thoughts
were
such
as
if
actual
blindness
had
really
fallen
upon
him
at
eight
he
entered
the
house
mrs
yule
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
she
looked
at
him
then
turned
away
towards
the
kitchen
he
went
upstairs
on
coming
down
again
he
found
breakfast
ready
as
usual
and
seated
himself
at
the
table
two
letters
waited
for
him
there
he
opened
them
when
mrs
yule
came
into
the
room
a
few
moments
later
she
was
astonished
by
a
burst
of
loud
mocking
laughter
from
her
husband
excited
as
it
appeared
by
something
he
was
reading
is
marian
up
he
asked
turning
to
her
she
is
not
coming
to
breakfast
then
just
take
that
letter
to
her
and
ask
her
to
read
mrs
yule
ascended
to
her
daughter
s
bedroom
she
knocked
was
bidden
enter
and
found
marian
packing
clothes
in
a
trunk
the
girl
looked
as
if
she
had
been
up
all
night
her
eyes
bore
the
traces
of
much
weeping
he
has
come
back
dear
said
mrs
yule
in
the
low
voice
of
apprehension
and
he
says
you
are
to
read
this
marian
took
the
sheet
unfolded
it
and
read
as
soon
as
she
had
reached
the
end
she
looked
wildly
at
her
mother
seemed
to
endeavour
vainly
to
speak
then
fell
to
the
floor
in
unconsciousness
the
mother
was
only
just
able
to
break
the
violence
of
her
fall
having
snatched
a
pillow
and
placed
it
beneath
marian
s
head
she
rushed
to
the
door
and
called
loudly
for
her
husband
who
in
a
moment
appeared
what
is
it
she
cried
to
him
look
she
has
fallen
down
in
a
faint
why
are
you
treating
her
like
this
attend
to
her
yule
replied
roughly
i
suppose
you
know
better
than
i
do
what
to
do
when
a
person
the
swoon
lasted
for
several
minutes
what
s
in
the
letter
asked
mrs
yule
whilst
chafing
the
lifeless
hands
her
money
s
lost
the
people
who
were
to
pay
it
have
just
she
won
t
get
anything
most
likely
nothing
at
the
letter
was
a
private
communication
from
one
of
john
yule
s
executors
it
seemed
likely
that
the
demand
upon
turberville
for
an
account
of
the
deceased
partner
s
share
in
their
business
had
helped
to
bring
about
a
crisis
in
affairs
that
were
already
unstable
something
might
be
recovered
in
the
legal
proceedings
that
would
result
but
there
were
circumstances
which
made
the
outlook
very
doubtful
as
marian
came
to
herself
her
father
left
the
room
an
hour
afterwards
mrs
yule
summoned
him
again
to
the
girl
s
chamber
he
went
and
found
marian
lying
on
the
bed
looking
like
one
who
had
been
long
i
wish
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
she
said
without
raising
herself
must
my
legacy
necessarily
be
paid
out
of
that
investment
it
must
those
are
the
terms
of
the
if
nothing
can
be
recovered
from
those
people
i
have
no
remedy
none
whatever
that
i
can
but
when
a
firm
is
bankrupt
they
generally
pay
some
portion
of
their
debts
sometimes
i
know
nothing
of
the
this
of
course
happens
to
me
marian
said
with
intense
bitterness
none
of
the
other
legatees
will
suffer
i
suppose
someone
must
but
to
a
very
small
of
course
when
shall
i
have
direct
information
you
can
write
to
mr
holden
you
have
his
thank
you
that
s
he
was
dismissed
and
went
quietly
away
part
five
chapter
xxx
waiting
on
destiny
throughout
the
day
marian
kept
her
room
her
intention
to
leave
the
house
was
of
course
abandoned
she
was
the
prisoner
of
fate
mrs
yule
would
have
tended
her
with
unremitting
devotion
but
the
girl
desired
to
be
alone
at
times
she
lay
in
silent
anguish
frequently
her
tears
broke
forth
and
she
sobbed
until
weariness
overcame
her
in
the
afternoon
she
wrote
a
letter
to
mr
holden
begging
that
she
might
be
kept
constantly
acquainted
with
the
progress
of
things
at
five
her
mother
brought
tea
wouldn
t
it
be
better
if
you
went
to
bed
now
marian
she
suggested
to
bed
but
i
am
going
out
in
an
hour
or
oh
you
can
t
dear
it
s
so
bitterly
cold
it
wouldn
t
be
good
for
i
have
to
go
out
mother
so
we
won
t
speak
of
it
was
not
safe
to
reply
mrs
yule
sat
down
and
watched
the
girl
raise
the
cup
to
her
mouth
with
trembling
hand
this
won
t
make
any
difference
to
you
in
the
end
my
darling
the
mother
ventured
to
say
at
length
alluding
for
the
first
time
to
the
effect
of
the
catastrophe
on
marian
s
immediate
prospects
of
course
not
was
the
reply
in
a
tone
of
mr
milvain
is
sure
to
have
plenty
of
money
before
you
feel
much
better
now
don
t
you
much
i
am
quite
well
at
seven
marian
went
out
finding
herself
weaker
than
she
had
thought
she
stopped
an
empty
cab
that
presently
passed
her
and
so
drove
to
the
milvains
lodgings
in
her
agitation
she
inquired
for
mr
milvain
instead
of
for
dora
as
was
her
habit
it
mattered
very
little
for
the
landlady
and
her
servants
were
of
course
under
no
misconception
regarding
this
young
lady
s
visits
jasper
was
at
home
and
working
he
had
but
to
look
at
marian
to
see
that
something
wretched
had
been
going
on
at
her
home
naturally
he
supposed
it
the
result
of
his
letter
to
mr
yule
your
father
has
been
behaving
brutally
he
said
holding
her
hands
and
gazing
anxiously
at
her
there
is
something
far
worse
than
that
worse
she
threw
off
her
outdoor
things
then
took
the
fatal
letter
from
her
pocket
and
handed
it
to
him
jasper
gave
a
whistle
of
consternation
and
looked
vacantly
from
the
paper
to
marian
s
countenance
how
the
deuce
comes
this
about
he
exclaimed
why
wasn
t
your
uncle
aware
of
the
state
of
things
perhaps
he
was
he
may
have
known
that
the
legacy
was
a
mere
you
are
the
only
one
affected
so
father
says
it
s
sure
to
be
the
this
has
upset
you
horribly
i
can
see
sit
down
marian
when
did
the
letter
come
this
and
you
have
been
fretting
over
it
all
day
but
come
we
must
keep
up
our
courage
you
may
get
something
substantial
out
of
the
scoundrels
even
whilst
he
spoke
his
eyes
wandered
absently
on
the
last
word
his
voice
failed
and
he
fell
into
abstraction
marian
s
look
was
fixed
upon
him
and
he
became
conscious
of
it
he
tried
to
smile
what
were
you
writing
she
asked
making
involuntary
diversion
from
the
calamitous
theme
rubbish
for
the
listen
to
this
paragraph
about
english
concert
it
was
as
necessary
to
him
as
to
her
to
have
a
respite
before
the
graver
discussion
began
he
seized
gladly
the
opportunity
she
offered
and
read
several
pages
of
manuscript
slipping
from
one
topic
to
another
to
hear
him
one
would
have
supposed
that
he
was
in
his
ordinary
mood
he
laughed
at
his
own
jokes
and
points
they
ll
have
to
pay
me
more
was
the
remark
with
which
he
closed
i
only
wanted
to
make
myself
indispensable
to
them
and
at
the
end
of
this
year
i
shall
feel
pretty
sure
of
that
they
ll
have
to
give
me
two
guineas
a
column
by
jove
they
and
you
may
hope
for
much
more
than
that
mayn
t
you
before
long
oh
i
shall
transfer
myself
to
a
better
paper
presently
it
seems
to
me
i
must
be
stirring
to
some
he
gave
her
a
significant
look
what
shall
we
do
jasper
work
and
wait
i
there
s
something
i
must
tell
you
father
said
i
had
better
sign
that
harrington
article
myself
if
i
do
that
i
shall
have
a
right
to
the
money
i
think
it
will
at
least
be
eight
guineas
and
why
shouldn
t
i
go
on
writing
for
myself
for
us
you
can
help
me
to
think
of
first
of
all
what
about
my
letter
to
your
father
we
are
forgetting
all
about
he
refused
to
marian
avoided
closer
description
of
what
had
happened
it
was
partly
that
she
felt
ashamed
of
her
father
s
unreasoning
wrath
and
feared
lest
jasper
s
pride
might
receive
an
injury
from
which
she
in
turn
would
suffer
partly
that
she
was
unwilling
to
pain
her
lover
by
making
display
of
all
she
had
undergone
oh
he
refused
to
reply
surely
that
is
extreme
what
she
dreaded
seemed
to
be
coming
to
pass
jasper
stood
rather
stiffly
and
threw
his
head
back
you
know
the
reason
dear
that
prejudice
has
entered
into
his
very
life
it
is
not
you
he
dislikes
that
is
impossible
he
thinks
of
you
only
as
he
would
of
anyone
connected
with
mr
well
well
it
isn
t
a
matter
of
much
moment
but
what
i
have
in
mind
is
this
will
it
be
possible
for
you
whilst
living
at
home
to
take
a
position
of
independence
and
say
that
you
are
going
to
work
for
your
own
profit
at
least
i
might
claim
half
the
money
i
can
earn
and
i
was
thinking
more
of
of
what
when
i
am
your
wife
i
may
be
able
to
help
i
could
earn
thirty
or
forty
pounds
a
year
i
think
that
would
pay
the
rent
of
a
small
she
spoke
with
shaken
voice
her
eyes
fixed
upon
his
face
but
my
dear
marian
we
surely
oughtn
t
to
think
of
marrying
so
long
as
expenses
are
so
nicely
fitted
as
all
that
no
i
only
meant
she
faltered
and
her
tongue
became
silent
as
her
heart
sank
it
simply
means
pursued
jasper
seating
himself
and
crossing
his
legs
that
i
must
move
heaven
and
earth
to
improve
my
position
you
know
that
my
faith
in
myself
is
not
small
there
s
no
knowing
what
i
might
do
if
i
used
every
effort
but
upon
my
word
i
don
t
see
much
hope
of
our
being
able
to
marry
for
a
year
or
two
under
the
most
favourable
no
i
quite
understand
can
you
promise
to
keep
a
little
love
for
me
all
that
time
he
asked
with
a
constrained
smile
you
know
me
too
well
to
i
thought
you
seemed
a
little
his
tone
was
not
altogether
that
which
makes
banter
pleasant
between
lovers
marian
looked
at
him
fearfully
was
it
possible
for
him
in
truth
so
to
misunderstand
her
he
had
never
satisfied
her
heart
s
desire
of
infinite
love
she
never
spoke
with
him
but
she
was
oppressed
with
the
suspicion
that
his
love
was
not
as
great
as
hers
and
worse
still
that
he
did
not
wholly
comprehend
the
which
she
strove
to
make
plain
in
every
word
you
don
t
say
that
seriously
jasper
but
answer
how
can
you
doubt
that
i
would
wait
faithfully
for
you
for
years
if
it
were
necessary
it
mustn
t
be
years
that
s
very
certain
i
think
it
preposterous
for
a
man
to
hold
a
woman
bound
in
that
hopeless
but
what
question
is
there
of
holding
me
bound
is
love
dependent
on
fixed
engagements
do
you
feel
that
if
we
agreed
to
part
your
love
would
be
at
once
a
thing
of
the
past
why
no
of
course
oh
but
how
coldly
you
speak
jasper
she
could
not
breathe
a
word
which
might
be
interpreted
as
fear
lest
the
change
of
her
circumstances
should
make
a
change
in
his
feeling
yet
that
was
in
her
mind
the
existence
of
such
a
fear
meant
of
course
that
she
did
not
entirely
trust
him
and
viewed
his
character
as
something
less
than
noble
very
seldom
indeed
is
a
woman
free
from
such
doubts
however
absolute
her
love
and
perhaps
it
is
just
as
rare
for
a
man
to
credit
in
his
heart
all
the
praises
he
speaks
of
his
beloved
passion
is
compatible
with
a
great
many
of
these
imperfections
of
intellectual
esteem
to
see
more
clearly
into
jasper
s
personality
was
for
marian
to
suffer
the
more
intolerable
dread
lest
she
should
lose
him
she
went
to
his
side
her
heart
ached
because
in
her
great
misery
he
had
not
fondled
her
and
intoxicated
her
senses
with
loving
words
how
can
i
make
you
feel
how
much
i
love
you
she
murmured
you
mustn
t
be
so
literal
dearest
women
are
so
desperately
it
comes
out
even
in
their
marian
was
not
without
perception
of
the
irony
of
such
an
opinion
on
jasper
s
lips
i
am
content
for
you
to
think
so
she
said
there
is
only
one
fact
in
my
life
of
any
importance
and
i
can
never
lose
sight
of
well
now
we
are
quite
sure
of
each
other
tell
me
plainly
do
you
think
me
capable
of
forsaking
you
because
you
have
perhaps
lost
your
money
the
question
made
her
wince
if
delicacy
had
held
her
tongue
it
had
no
control
of
his
how
can
i
answer
that
better
she
said
than
by
saying
i
love
you
it
was
no
answer
and
jasper
though
obtuse
compared
with
her
understood
that
it
was
none
but
the
emotion
which
had
prompted
his
words
was
genuine
enough
her
touch
the
perfume
of
her
passion
had
their
exalting
effect
upon
him
he
felt
in
all
sincerity
that
to
forsake
her
would
be
a
baseness
revenged
by
the
loss
of
such
a
wife
there
s
an
uphill
fight
before
me
that
s
all
he
said
instead
of
the
pretty
smooth
course
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
but
i
don
t
fear
it
marian
i
m
not
the
fellow
to
be
beaten
you
shall
be
my
wife
and
you
shall
have
as
many
luxuries
as
if
you
had
brought
me
a
luxuries
oh
how
childish
you
seem
to
think
me
not
a
bit
of
it
luxuries
are
a
most
important
part
of
life
i
had
rather
not
live
at
all
than
never
possess
them
let
me
give
you
a
useful
hint
if
ever
i
seem
to
you
to
flag
just
remind
me
of
the
difference
between
these
lodgings
and
a
richly
furnished
house
just
hint
to
me
that
the
journalist
goes
about
in
his
carriage
and
can
give
his
wife
a
box
at
the
theatre
just
ask
me
casually
how
i
should
like
to
run
over
to
the
riviera
when
london
fogs
are
thickest
you
understand
that
s
the
way
to
keep
me
at
it
like
a
you
are
right
all
those
things
enable
one
to
live
a
better
and
fuller
life
oh
how
cruel
that
i
that
we
are
robbed
in
this
way
you
can
have
no
idea
how
terrible
a
blow
it
was
to
me
when
i
read
that
letter
this
she
was
on
the
point
of
confessing
that
she
had
swooned
but
something
restrained
her
your
father
can
hardly
be
sorry
said
jasper
i
think
he
speaks
more
harshly
than
he
feels
the
worst
was
that
until
he
got
your
letter
he
had
kept
hoping
that
i
would
let
him
have
the
money
for
a
new
well
for
the
present
i
prefer
to
believe
that
the
money
isn
t
all
lost
if
the
blackguards
pay
ten
shillings
in
the
pound
you
will
get
two
thousand
five
hundred
out
of
them
and
that
s
something
but
how
do
you
stand
will
your
position
be
that
of
an
ordinary
creditor
i
am
so
ignorant
i
know
nothing
of
such
but
of
course
your
interests
will
be
properly
looked
after
put
yourself
in
communication
with
this
mr
holden
i
ll
have
a
look
into
the
law
on
the
subject
let
us
hope
as
long
as
we
can
by
jove
there
s
no
other
way
of
facing
no
mrs
reardon
and
the
rest
of
them
are
safe
enough
i
suppose
oh
no
confound
them
it
grows
upon
one
one
doesn
t
take
in
the
whole
of
such
a
misfortune
at
once
we
must
hold
on
to
the
last
rag
of
hope
and
in
the
meantime
i
ll
half
work
myself
to
death
are
you
going
to
see
the
girls
not
you
must
tell
dora
will
cry
her
eyes
out
upon
my
word
maud
ll
have
to
draw
in
her
horns
i
must
frighten
her
into
economy
and
hard
he
again
lost
himself
in
anxious
reverie
marian
couldn
t
you
try
your
hand
at
fiction
she
started
remembering
that
her
father
had
put
the
same
question
so
recently
i
m
afraid
i
could
do
nothing
worth
that
isn
t
exactly
the
question
could
you
do
anything
that
would
sell
with
very
moderate
success
in
fiction
you
might
make
three
times
as
much
as
you
ever
will
by
magazine
a
girl
like
you
oh
you
might
manage
i
should
a
girl
like
me
well
i
mean
that
and
that
kind
of
thing
would
be
very
much
in
your
marian
was
not
given
to
blushing
very
few
girls
are
even
on
strong
provocation
for
the
first
time
jasper
saw
her
cheeks
colour
deeply
and
it
was
with
anything
but
pleasure
his
words
were
coarsely
inconsiderate
and
wounded
her
i
think
that
is
not
my
work
she
said
coldly
looking
away
but
surely
there
s
no
harm
in
my
saying
he
paused
in
astonishment
i
meant
nothing
that
could
offend
i
know
you
didn
t
jasper
but
you
make
me
think
that
don
t
be
so
literal
again
my
dear
girl
come
here
and
forgive
she
did
not
approach
but
only
because
the
painful
thought
he
had
excited
kept
her
to
that
spot
come
marian
then
i
must
come
to
he
did
so
and
held
her
in
his
arms
try
your
hand
at
a
novel
dear
if
you
can
possibly
make
time
put
me
in
it
if
you
like
and
make
me
an
insensible
masculine
the
experiment
is
worth
a
try
i
m
certain
at
all
events
do
a
few
chapters
and
let
me
see
them
a
chapter
needn
t
take
you
more
than
a
couple
of
hours
i
should
marian
refrained
from
giving
any
promise
she
seemed
irresponsive
to
his
caresses
that
thought
which
at
times
gives
trouble
to
all
women
of
strong
emotions
was
working
in
her
had
she
been
too
demonstrative
and
made
her
love
too
cheap
now
that
jasper
s
love
might
be
endangered
it
behoved
her
to
use
any
arts
which
nature
prompted
and
so
for
once
he
was
not
wholly
satisfied
with
her
and
at
their
parting
he
wondered
what
subtle
change
had
affected
her
manner
to
him
why
didn
t
marian
come
to
speak
a
word
said
dora
when
her
brother
entered
the
girls
about
ten
o
clock
you
knew
she
was
with
me
then
we
heard
her
voice
as
she
was
going
she
brought
me
some
enspiriting
news
and
thought
it
better
i
should
have
the
reporting
of
it
to
with
brevity
he
made
known
what
had
befallen
cheerful
isn
t
it
the
kind
of
thing
that
strengthens
one
s
trust
in
the
girls
were
appalled
maud
who
was
reading
by
the
fireside
let
her
book
fall
to
her
lap
and
knit
her
brows
darkly
then
your
marriage
must
be
put
off
of
course
said
dora
well
i
shouldn
t
be
surprised
if
that
were
found
necessary
replied
her
brother
caustically
he
was
able
now
to
give
vent
to
the
feeling
which
in
marian
s
presence
was
suppressed
partly
out
of
consideration
for
her
and
partly
owing
to
her
influence
and
shall
we
have
to
go
back
to
our
old
lodgings
again
inquired
maud
jasper
gave
no
answer
but
kicked
a
footstool
savagely
out
of
his
way
and
paced
the
room
oh
do
you
think
we
need
said
dora
with
unusual
protest
against
economy
remember
that
it
s
a
matter
for
your
own
consideration
jasper
replied
at
length
you
are
living
on
your
own
resources
you
maud
glanced
at
her
sister
but
dora
was
preoccupied
why
do
you
prefer
to
stay
here
jasper
asked
abruptly
of
the
younger
girl
it
is
so
very
much
nicer
she
replied
with
some
embarrassment
he
bit
the
ends
of
his
moustache
and
his
eyes
glared
at
the
impalpable
thwarting
force
that
to
imagination
seemed
to
fill
the
air
about
him
a
lesson
against
being
he
muttered
again
kicking
the
footstool
did
you
make
that
considerate
remark
to
marian
asked
maud
there
would
have
been
no
harm
if
i
had
done
she
knows
that
i
shouldn
t
have
been
such
an
ass
as
to
talk
of
marriage
without
the
prospect
of
something
to
live
i
suppose
she
s
wretched
said
dora
what
else
can
you
expect
and
did
you
propose
to
release
her
from
the
burden
of
her
engagement
maud
inquired
it
s
a
confounded
pity
that
you
re
not
rich
maud
replied
her
brother
with
an
involuntary
laugh
you
would
have
a
brilliant
reputation
for
he
walked
about
and
ejaculated
splenetic
phrases
on
the
subject
of
his
we
are
here
and
here
we
must
stay
was
the
final
expression
of
his
mood
i
have
only
one
superstition
that
i
know
of
and
that
forbids
me
to
take
a
step
backward
if
i
went
into
poorer
lodgings
again
i
should
feel
it
was
inviting
defeat
i
shall
stay
as
long
as
the
position
is
tenable
let
us
get
on
to
christmas
and
then
see
how
things
look
heavens
suppose
we
had
married
and
after
that
lost
the
money
you
would
have
been
no
worse
off
than
plenty
of
literary
men
said
dora
perhaps
not
but
as
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
be
considerably
better
off
than
most
literary
men
that
reflection
wouldn
t
console
me
much
things
are
in
statu
quo
that
s
all
i
have
to
rely
upon
my
own
efforts
what
s
the
time

i
can
get
two
hours
work
before
going
to
and
nodding
a
he
left
them
when
marian
entered
the
house
and
went
upstairs
she
was
followed
by
her
mother
on
mrs
yule
s
countenance
there
was
a
new
distress
she
had
been
crying
recently
have
you
seen
him
the
mother
asked
yes
we
have
talked
about
what
does
he
wish
you
to
do
dear
there
s
nothing
to
be
done
except
father
has
been
telling
me
something
marian
said
mrs
yule
after
a
long
silence
he
says
he
is
going
to
be
blind
there
s
something
the
matter
with
his
eyes
and
he
went
to
see
someone
about
it
this
afternoon
he
ll
get
worse
and
worse
until
there
has
been
an
operation
and
perhaps
he
ll
never
be
able
to
use
his
eyes
properly
the
girl
listened
in
an
attitude
of
despair
he
has
seen
an
oculist
a
really
good
doctor
he
says
he
went
to
one
of
the
and
how
did
he
speak
to
you
he
doesn
t
seem
to
care
much
what
happens
he
talked
of
going
to
the
workhouse
and
things
like
that
but
it
couldn
t
ever
come
to
that
could
it
marian
wouldn
t
somebody
help
him
there
s
not
much
help
to
be
expected
in
this
world
answered
the
girl
physical
weariness
brought
her
a
few
hours
of
oblivion
as
soon
as
she
had
lain
down
but
her
sleep
came
to
an
end
in
the
early
morning
when
the
pressure
of
evil
dreams
forced
her
back
to
consciousness
of
real
sorrows
and
cares
a
sky
added
its
weight
to
crush
her
spirit
at
the
hour
when
she
usually
rose
it
was
still
all
but
as
dark
as
midnight
her
mother
s
voice
at
the
door
begged
her
to
lie
and
rest
until
it
grew
lighter
and
she
willingly
complied
feeling
indeed
scarcely
capable
of
leaving
her
bed
the
thick
black
fog
penetrated
every
corner
of
the
house
it
could
be
smelt
and
tasted
such
an
atmosphere
produces
languor
even
in
the
vigorous
and
hopeful
to
those
wasted
by
suffering
it
is
the
very
reek
of
the
bottomless
pit
poisoning
the
soul
her
face
colourless
as
the
pillow
marian
lay
neither
sleeping
nor
awake
in
blank
extremity
of
woe
tears
now
and
then
ran
down
her
cheeks
and
at
times
her
body
was
shaken
with
a
throe
such
as
might
result
from
anguish
of
the
torture
chamber
midway
in
the
morning
when
it
was
still
necessary
to
use
artificial
light
she
went
down
to
the
the
course
of
household
life
had
been
thrown
into
confusion
by
the
disasters
of
the
last
day
or
two
mrs
yule
who
occupied
herself
almost
exclusively
with
questions
of
economy
cleanliness
and
routine
had
not
the
heart
to
pursue
her
round
of
duties
and
this
morning
though
under
normal
circumstances
she
would
have
been
busy
in
turning
out
the
she
moved
aimlessly
and
despondently
about
the
house
giving
the
servant
contradictory
orders
and
then
blaming
herself
for
her
in
the
troubles
of
her
husband
and
her
daughter
she
had
scarcely
greater
share
so
far
as
active
participation
went
than
if
she
had
been
only
a
faithful
old
housekeeper
she
could
only
grieve
and
lament
that
such
discord
had
come
between
the
two
whom
she
loved
and
that
in
herself
was
no
power
even
to
solace
their
distresses
marian
found
her
standing
in
the
passage
with
a
duster
in
one
hand
and
a
in
the
other
your
father
has
asked
to
see
you
when
you
come
down
mrs
yule
whispered
i
ll
go
to
marian
entered
the
study
her
father
was
not
in
his
place
at
the
nor
yet
seated
in
the
chair
which
he
used
when
he
had
leisure
to
draw
up
to
the
fireside
he
sat
in
front
of
one
of
the
bookcases
bent
forward
as
if
seeking
a
volume
but
his
chin
was
propped
upon
his
hand
and
he
had
maintained
this
position
for
a
long
time
he
did
not
immediately
move
when
he
raised
his
head
marian
saw
that
he
looked
older
and
she
noticed
or
fancied
she
did
that
there
was
some
unfamiliar
peculiarity
about
his
eyes
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
coming
he
began
with
distant
formality
since
i
saw
you
last
i
have
learnt
something
which
makes
a
change
in
my
position
and
prospects
and
it
is
necessary
to
speak
on
the
subject
i
won
t
detain
you
more
than
a
few
he
coughed
and
seemed
to
consider
his
next
words
perhaps
i
needn
t
repeat
what
i
have
told
your
mother
you
have
learnt
it
from
her
i
dare
yes
with
much
thank
you
but
we
will
leave
aside
that
aspect
of
the
matter
for
a
few
more
months
i
may
be
able
to
pursue
my
ordinary
work
but
before
long
i
shall
certainly
be
disabled
from
earning
my
livelihood
by
literature
whether
this
will
in
any
way
affect
your
own
position
i
don
t
know
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
whether
you
still
purpose
leaving
this
house
i
have
no
means
of
doing
is
there
any
likelihood
of
your
marriage
taking
place
let
us
say
within
four
months
only
if
the
executors
recover
my
money
or
a
large
portion
of
i
understand
my
reason
for
asking
is
this
my
lease
of
this
house
terminates
at
the
end
of
next
march
and
i
shall
certainly
not
be
justified
in
renewing
it
if
you
are
able
to
provide
for
yourself
in
any
way
it
will
be
sufficient
for
me
to
rent
two
rooms
after
that
this
disease
which
affects
my
eyes
may
be
only
temporary
in
due
time
an
operation
may
render
it
possible
for
me
to
work
again
in
hope
of
that
i
shall
probably

and

summons
the
chances
are
that
you
have
neither
understanding
nor
sympathy
for
men
such
as
edwin
reardon
and
harold
biffen
they
merely
provoke
you
they
seem
to
you
inert
flabby
weakly
envious
foolishly
obstinate
impiously
mutinous
and
many
other
things
you
are
made
angrily

by
their
failure
to
get

s
eye
in
short
take
a
leaf
from
the
book
of
mr
jasper
milvain
but
try
to
imagine
a
personality
wholly
unfitted
for
the
rough
and
tumble
of
the
world
s
from
the
familiar
point
of
view
these
men
were
worthless
view
them
in
possible
relation
to
a
humane
order
of
society
and
they
are
admirable
citizens
nothing
is
easier
than
to
condemn
a
type
of
character
which
is
unequal
to
the
coarse
demands
of
life
as
it
suits
the
average
man
these
two
were
richly
endowed
with
the
kindly
and
the
imaginative
virtues
if
fate
threw
them
amid
incongruous
circumstances
is
their
endowment
of
less
value
you
scorn
their
passivity
but
it
was
their
nature
and
their
merit
to
be
passive
gifted
with
independent
means
each
of
them
would
have
taken
quite
a
different
aspect
in
your
eyes
the
sum
of
their
faults
was
their
inability
to
earn
money
but
indeed
that
inability
does
not
call
for
unmingled
disdain
it
was
very
weak
of
harold
biffen
to
come
so
near
perishing
of
hunger
as
he
did
in
the
days
when
he
was
completing
his
novel
but
he
would
have
vastly
preferred
to
eat
and
be
satisfied
had
any
method
of
obtaining
food
presented
itself
to
him
he
did
not
starve
for
the
pleasure
of
the
thing
i
assure
you
pupils
were
difficult
to
get
just
now
and
writing
that
he
had
sent
to
magazines
had
returned
upon
his
hands
he
pawned
such
of
his
possessions
as
he
could
spare
and
he
reduced
his
meals
to
the
minimum
nor
was
he
uncheerful
in
his
cold
garret
and
with
his
empty
stomach
for
mr
bailey
grocer
drew
steadily
to
an
end
he
worked
very
slowly
the
book
would
make
perhaps
two
volumes
of
ordinary
novel
size
but
he
had
laboured
over
it
for
many
months
patiently
affectionately
scrupulously
each
sentence
was
as
good
as
he
could
make
it
harmonious
to
the
ear
with
words
of
precious
meaning
skilfully
set
before
sitting
down
to
a
chapter
he
planned
it
minutely
in
his
mind
then
he
wrote
a
rough
draft
of
it
then
he
elaborated
the
thing
phrase
by
phrase
he
had
no
thought
of
whether
such
toil
would
be
recompensed
in
coin
of
the
realm
nay
it
was
his
conviction
that
if
with
difficulty
published
it
could
scarcely
bring
him
money
the
work
must
be
significant
that
was
all
he
cared
for
and
he
had
no
society
of
admiring
friends
to
encourage
him
reardon
understood
the
merit
of
the
workmanship
but
frankly
owned
that
the
book
was
repulsive
to
him
to
the
public
it
would
be
worse
than
repulsive
tedious
utterly
uninteresting
no
matter
it
drew
to
its
end
the
day
of
its
completion
was
made
memorable
by
an
event
decidedly
more
exciting
even
to
the
author
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
there
remained
half
a
page
to
be
written
biffen
had
already
worked
about
nine
hours
and
on
breaking
off
to
appease
his
hunger
he
doubted
whether
to
finish
or
to
postpone
the
last
lines
till
tomorrow
the
discovery
that
only
a
small
crust
of
bread
lay
in
the
cupboard
decided
him
to
write
no
more
he
would
have
to
go
out
to
purchase
a
loaf
and
that
was
disturbance
but
stay
had
he
enough
money
he
searched
his
pockets
two
pence
and
two
farthings
no
more
you
are
probably
not
aware
that
at
bakers
shops
in
the
poor
quarters
the
price
of
the
loaf
varies
sometimes
from
week
to
week
at
present
as
biffen
knew
it
was
twopence
a
common
figure
but
harold
did
not
possess
three
farthings
only
two
reflecting
he
remembered
to
have
passed
yesterday
a
shop
where
the
bread
was
marked
twopence
halfpenny
it
was
a
shop
in
a
very
obscure
little
street
off
hampstead
road
some
distance
from
clipstone
street
thither
he
must
repair
he
had
only
his
hat
and
a
muffler
to
put
on
for
again
he
was
wearing
his
overcoat
in
default
of
the
under
one
and
his
ragged
umbrella
to
take
from
the
corner
so
he
went
forth
to
his
delight
the
twopence
halfpenny
announcement
was
still
in
the
baker
s
window
he
obtained
a
loaf
wrapped
it
in
the
piece
of
paper
he
had
brought
small
bakers
decline
to
supply
paper
for
this
purpose
and
strode
joyously
homeward
again
having
eaten
he
looked
longingly
at
his
manuscript
but
half
a
page
more
should
he
not
finish
it
the
temptation
was
irresistible
he
sat
down
wrought
with
unusual
speed
and
at
ten
wrote
with
magnificent
flourish
the
his
fire
was
out
and
he
had
neither
coals
nor
wood
but
his
feet
were
frozen
into
lifelessness
impossible
to
go
to
bed
like
this
he
must
take
another
turn
in
the
streets
it
would
suit
his
humour
to
ramble
a
while
had
it
not
been
so
late
he
would
have
gone
to
see
reardon
who
expected
the
communication
of
this
glorious
news
so
again
he
locked
his
door
downstairs
he
stumbled
over
something
or
somebody
in
the
dark
who
is
that
he
cried
the
answer
was
a
loud
snore
biffen
went
to
the
bottom
of
the
house
and
called
to
the
landlady
mrs
willoughby
who
is
asleep
on
the
stairs
why
i
spect
it
s
mr
briggs
replied
the
woman
indulgently
don
t
you
mind
him
mr
biffen
there
s
no
arm
he
s
only
had
a
little
too
much
i
ll
go
up
an
make
him
go
to
bed
as
soon
as
i
ve
got
my
ands
the
necessity
for
waiting
till
then
isn
t
obvious
remarked
the
realist
with
a
chuckle
and
went
his
way
he
walked
at
a
sharp
pace
for
more
than
an
hour
and
about
midnight
drew
near
to
his
own
quarter
again
he
had
just
turned
up
by
the
middlesex
hospital
and
was
at
no
great
distance
from
clipstone
street
when
a
yell
and
scamper
caught
his
attention
a
group
of
loafing
blackguards
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
had
suddenly
broken
up
and
as
they
rushed
off
he
heard
the
word
fire
this
was
too
common
an
occurrence
to
disturb
his
equanimity
he
wondered
absently
in
which
street
the
fire
might
be
but
trudged
on
without
a
thought
of
making
investigation
repeated
yells
and
rushes
however
assailed
his
apathy
two
women
came
tearing
by
him
and
he
shouted
to
them
where
is
it
in
clipstone
street
they
say
one
screamed
back
he
could
no
longer
be
unconcerned
if
in
his
own
street
the
conflagration
might
be
in
the
very
house
he
inhabited
and
in
that
case
he
set
off
at
a
run
ahead
of
him
was
a
thickening
throng
its
position
indicating
the
entrance
to
clipstone
street
soon
he
found
his
progress
retarded
he
had
to
dodge
this
way
and
that
to
force
progress
to
guard
himself
against
overthrows
by
the
torrent
of
ruffiandom
which
always
breaks
forth
at
the
cry
of
fire
he
could
now
smell
the
smoke
and
all
at
once
a
black
volume
of
it
bursting
from
upper
windows
alarmed
his
sight
at
once
he
was
aware
that
if
not
his
own
dwelling
it
must
be
one
of
those
on
either
side
that
was
in
flames
as
yet
no
engine
had
arrived
and
straggling
policemen
were
only
just
beginning
to
make
their
way
to
the
scene
of
uproar
by
dint
of
violent
effort
biffen
moved
forward
yard
by
yard
a
tongue
of
flame
which
suddenly
illumined
the
fronts
of
the
houses
put
an
end
to
his
doubt
let
me
get
past
he
shouted
to
the
gaping
and
swaying
mass
of
people
in
front
of
him
i
live
there
i
must
go
upstairs
to
save
something
his
educated
accent
moved
attention
repeating
the
demand
again
and
again
he
succeeded
in
getting
forward
and
at
length
was
near
enough
to
see
that
people
were
dragging
articles
of
furniture
out
on
to
the
pavement
that
you
mr
biffen
cried
someone
to
him
he
recognised
the
face
of
a
is
it
possible
to
get
up
to
my
room
broke
frantically
from
his
lips
you
ll
never
get
up
there
it
s
that
briggs
the
epithet
was
alliterative
as
upset
his
lamp
and
i
ope
he
ll
well
get
roasted
to
biffen
leaped
on
to
the
threshold
and
crashed
against
mrs
willoughby
the
landlady
who
was
carrying
a
huge
bundle
of
household
linen
i
told
you
to
look
after
that
drunken
brute
he
said
to
her
can
i
get
upstairs
what
do
i
care
whether
you
can
or
not
the
woman
shrieked
my
god
and
all
them
new
chairs
as
i
bought
he
heard
no
more
but
bounded
over
a
confusion
of
obstacles
and
in
a
moment
was
on
the
landing
of
the
first
storey
here
he
encountered
a
man
who
had
not
lost
his
head
a
stalwart
mechanic
engaged
in
slipping
clothes
on
to
two
little
children
if
somebody
don
t
drag
that
fellow
briggs
down
he
ll
be
dead
observed
the
man
he
s
layin
outside
his
door
i
pulled
him
out
but
i
can
t
do
no
more
for
smoke
grew
thick
on
the
staircase
burning
was
as
yet
confined
to
that
front
room
on
the
second
floor
tenanted
by
briggs
the
disastrous
but
in
all
likelihood
the
ceiling
was
ablaze
and
if
so
it
would
be
all
but
impossible
for
biffen
to
gain
his
own
chamber
which
was
at
the
back
on
the
floor
above
no
one
was
making
an
attempt
to
extinguish
the
fire
personal
safety
and
the
rescue
of
their
possessions
alone
occupied
the
thoughts
of
such
people
as
were
still
in
the
house
desperate
with
the
dread
of
losing
his
manuscript
his
toil
his
one
hope
the
realist
scarcely
stayed
to
listen
to
a
warning
that
the
fumes
were
impassable
with
head
bent
he
rushed
up
to
the
next
landing
there
lay
briggs
perchance
already
stifled
and
through
the
open
door
biffen
had
a
horrible
vision
of
furnace
fury
to
go
yet
higher
would
have
been
madness
but
for
one
encouragement
he
knew
that
on
his
own
storey
was
a
ladder
giving
access
to
a
by
which
he
might
issue
on
to
the
roof
whence
escape
to
the
adjacent
houses
would
be
practicable
again
a
leap
forward
in
fact
not
two
minutes
elapsed
from
his
commencing
the
ascent
of
the
stairs
to
the
moment
when
all
but
fainting
he
thrust
the
key
into
his
door
and
fell
forward
into
purer
air
fell
for
he
was
on
his
knees
and
had
begun
to
suffer
from
a
sense
of
failing
power
a
sick
whirling
of
the
brain
a
terror
of
hideous
death
his
manuscript
was
on
the
table
where
he
had
left
it
after
regarding
and
handling
it
with
joyful
though
it
was
pitch
dark
in
the
room
he
could
at
once
lay
his
hand
on
the
heap
of
paper
now
he
had
it
now
it
was
jammed
tight
under
his
left
arm
now
he
was
out
again
on
the
landing
in
smoke
more
deadly
than
ever
he
said
to
himself
if
i
can
not
instantly
break
out
by
the
it
s
all
over
with
that
the
exit
would
open
to
a
vigorous
thrust
he
knew
having
amused
himself
not
long
ago
by
going
on
to
the
roof
he
touched
the
ladder
sprang
upwards
and
felt
the
trap
above
him
but
he
could
not
push
it
back
i
m
a
dead
man
flashed
across
his
mind
and
all
for
the
sake
of
mr
bailey
a
frenzied
effort
the
last
of
which
his
muscles
were
capable
and
the
door
yielded
his
head
was
now
through
the
aperture
and
though
the
smoke
swept
up
about
him
that
gasp
of
cold
air
gave
him
strength
to
throw
himself
on
the
flat
portion
of
the
roof
that
he
had
reached
so
for
a
minute
or
two
he
lay
then
he
was
able
to
stand
to
survey
his
position
and
to
walk
along
by
the
parapet
he
looked
down
upon
the
surging
and
shouting
crowd
in
clipstone
street
but
could
see
it
only
at
intervals
owing
to
the
smoke
that
rolled
from
the
front
windows
below
him
what
he
had
now
to
do
he
understood
perfectly
this
roof
was
divided
from
those
on
either
hand
by
a
stack
of
chimneys
to
get
round
the
end
of
these
stacks
was
impossible
or
at
all
events
too
dangerous
a
feat
unless
it
were
the
last
resource
but
by
climbing
to
the
apex
of
the
slates
he
would
be
able
to
reach
the
to
drag
himself
up
to
them
and
somehow
to
tumble
over
on
to
the
safer
side
to
this
undertaking
he
forthwith
addressed
himself
without
difficulty
he
reached
the
ridge
standing
on
it
he
found
that
only
by
stretching
his
arm
to
the
utmost
could
he
grip
the
top
of
a
had
he
the
strength
necessary
to
raise
himself
by
such
a
hold
and
suppose
the
pot
broke
his
life
was
still
in
danger
the
increasing
volumes
of
smoke
warned
him
that
in
a
few
minutes
the
uppermost
storey
might
be
in
flames
he
took
off
his
overcoat
to
allow
himself
more
freedom
of
action
the
manuscript
now
an
encumbrance
must
precede
him
over
the
and
there
was
only
one
way
of
effecting
that
with
care
he
stowed
the
papers
into
the
pockets
of
the
coat
then
he
rolled
the
garment
together
tied
it
up
in
its
own
sleeves
took
a
deliberate
aim
and
the
bundle
was
for
the
present
in
safety
now
for
the
gymnastic
endeavour
standing
on
tiptoe
he
clutched
the
rim
of
the
and
strove
to
raise
himself
the
hold
was
firm
enough
but
his
arms
were
far
too
puny
to
perform
such
work
even
when
death
would
be
the
penalty
of
failure
too
long
he
had
lived
on
insufficient
food
and
sat
over
the
debilitating
desk
he
swung
this
way
and
that
trying
to
throw
one
of
his
knees
as
high
as
the
top
of
the
brickwork
but
there
was
no
chance
of
his
succeeding
dropping
on
to
the
slates
he
sat
there
in
perturbation
he
must
cry
for
help
in
front
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
stand
by
the
parapet
owing
to
the
black
clouds
of
smoke
now
mingled
with
sparks
perchance
he
might
attract
the
notice
of
some
person
either
in
the
yards
behind
or
at
the
back
windows
of
other
houses
the
night
was
so
obscure
that
he
could
not
hope
to
be
seen
voice
alone
must
be
depended
upon
and
there
was
no
certainty
that
it
would
be
heard
far
enough
though
he
stood
in
his
in
a
bitter
wind
no
sense
of
cold
affected
him
his
face
was
beaded
with
perspiration
drawn
forth
by
his
futile
struggle
to
climb
he
let
himself
slide
down
the
rear
slope
and
holding
by
the
end
of
the
chimney
brickwork
looked
into
the
yards
at
the
same
instant
a
face
appeared
to
him
that
of
a
man
who
was
trying
to
obtain
a
glimpse
of
this
roof
from
that
of
the
next
house
by
thrusting
out
his
head
beyond
the
block
of
chimneys
hollo
cried
the
stranger
what
are
you
doing
there
trying
to
escape
of
course
help
me
to
get
on
to
your
by
god
i
expected
to
see
the
fire
coming
through
already
are
you
the
as
upset
his
lamp
an
fired
the
bloomin
ouse
not
i
he
s
lying
drunk
on
the
stairs
dead
by
this
by
god
i
wouldn
t
have
helped
you
if
you
d
been
him
how
are
you
coming
round
blest
if
i
see
you
ll
break
your
bloomin
neck
if
you
try
this
corner
you
ll
have
to
come
over
the
chimneys
wait
till
i
get
a
and
a
rope
shouted
biffen
the
man
disappeared
for
five
minutes
to
biffen
it
seemed
half
an
hour
he
felt
or
imagined
he
felt
the
slates
getting
hot
beneath
him
and
the
smoke
was
again
catching
his
breath
but
at
length
there
was
a
shout
from
the
top
of
the
the
rescuer
had
seated
himself
on
one
of
the
pots
and
was
about
to
lower
on
biffen
s
side
a
ladder
which
had
enabled
him
to
ascend
from
the
other
biffen
planted
the
lowest
rung
very
carefully
on
the
ridge
of
the
roof
climbed
as
lightly
as
possible
got
a
footing
between
two
pots
the
ladder
was
then
pulled
over
and
both
men
descended
in
safety
have
you
seen
a
coat
lying
about
here
was
biffen
s
first
question
i
threw
mine
what
did
you
do
that
for
there
are
some
valuable
papers
in
the
they
searched
in
vain
on
neither
side
of
the
roof
was
the
coat
discoverable
you
must
have
pitched
it
into
the
street
said
the
man
this
was
a
terrible
blow
biffen
forgot
his
rescue
from
destruction
in
lament
for
the
loss
of
his
manuscript
he
would
have
pursued
the
fruitless
search
but
his
companion
who
feared
that
the
fire
might
spread
to
adjoining
houses
insisted
on
his
passing
through
the
and
descending
the
if
the
coat
fell
into
the
street
biffen
said
when
they
were
down
on
the
ground
floor
of
course
it
s
lost
it
would
be
stolen
at
once
but
may
not
it
have
fallen
into
your
back
yard
he
was
standing
in
the
midst
of
a
cluster
of
alarmed
people
who
stared
at
him
in
astonishment
for
the
reek
through
which
he
had
fought
his
way
had
given
him
the
aspect
of
a
sweep
his
suggestion
prompted
someone
to
run
into
the
yard
with
the
result
that
a
muddy
bundle
was
brought
in
and
exhibited
to
him
is
this
your
coat
mister
heaven
be
thanked
that
s
it
there
are
valuable
papers
in
the
he
unrolled
the
garment
felt
to
make
sure
that
mr
bailey
was
safe
and
finally
put
it
on
will
anyone
here
let
me
sit
down
in
a
room
and
give
me
a
drink
of
water
he
asked
feeling
now
as
if
he
must
drop
with
exhaustion
the
man
who
had
rescued
him
performed
this
further
kindness
and
for
half
an
hour
whilst
tumult
indescribable
raged
about
him
biffen
sat
recovering
his
strength
by
that
time
the
firemen
were
hard
at
work
but
one
floor
of
the
burning
house
had
already
fallen
through
and
it
was
probable
that
nothing
but
the
shell
would
be
saved
after
giving
a
full
account
of
himself
to
the
people
among
whom
he
had
come
harold
declared
his
intention
of
departing
his
need
of
repose
was
imperative
and
he
could
not
hope
for
it
in
this
proximity
to
the
fire
as
he
had
no
money
his
only
course
was
to
inquire
for
a
room
at
some
house
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
where
the
people
would
receive
him
in
a
charitable
spirit
with
the
aid
of
the
police
he
passed
to
where
the
crowd
was
thinner
and
came
out
into
cleveland
street
here
most
of
the
were
open
and
he
made
several
applications
for
hospitality
but
either
his
story
was
doubted
or
his
grimy
appearance
predisposed
people
against
him
at
length
when
again
his
strength
was
all
but
at
an
end
he
made
appeal
to
a
policeman
surely
you
can
tell
he
protested
after
explaining
his
position
that
i
don
t
want
to
cheat
anybody
i
shall
have
money
if
no
one
will
take
me
in
you
must
haul
me
on
some
charge
to
the
i
shall
have
to
lie
down
on
the
pavement
in
a
the
officer
recognised
a
man
who
was
standing
on
a
threshold
close
by
he
stepped
up
to
him
and
made
representations
which
were
successful
in
a
few
minutes
biffen
took
possession
of
an
underground
room
furnished
as
a
bedchamber
which
he
agreed
to
rent
for
a
week
his
landlord
was
not
ungracious
and
went
so
far
as
to
supply
him
with
warm
water
that
he
might
in
a
measure
cleanse
himself
this
operation
rapidly
performed
the
hapless
author
flung
himself
into
bed
and
before
long
was
fast
asleep
when
he
went
upstairs
about
nine
o
clock
in
the
morning
he
discovered
that
his
host
kept
an
lost
everything
have
you
asked
the
man
sympathetically
everything
except
the
clothes
i
wear
and
some
papers
that
i
managed
to
save
all
my
books
burnt
biffen
shook
his
head
dolorously
your
cried
the
dealer
in
oil
dear
dear
and
what
might
your
business
be
the
author
corrected
this
misapprehension
in
the
end
he
was
invited
to
break
his
fast
which
he
did
right
willingly
then
with
assurances
that
he
would
return
before
nightfall
he
left
the
house
his
steps
were
naturally
first
directed
to
clipstone
street
the
familiar
abode
was
a
gruesome
ruin
still
smoking
neighbours
informed
him
that
mr
briggs
s
body
had
been
brought
forth
in
a
horrible
condition
but
this
was
the
only
loss
of
life
that
had
happened
thence
he
struck
eastward
and
at
eleven
came
to
manville
street
islington
he
found
reardon
by
the
fireside
looking
very
ill
and
speaking
with
hoarseness
another
cold
it
looks
like
it
i
wish
you
would
take
the
trouble
to
go
and
buy
me
some
that
would
suit
my
then
what
would
suit
mine
behold
me
undeniably
a
philosopher
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
words
omnia
mecum
he
recounted
his
adventures
and
with
such
humorous
vivacity
that
when
he
ceased
the
two
laughed
together
as
if
nothing
more
amusing
had
ever
been
heard
ah
but
my
books
my
books
exclaimed
biffen
with
a
genuine
groan
and
all
my
notes
at
one
fell
swoop
if
i
didn
t
laugh
old
friend
i
should
sit
down
and
cry
indeed
i
should
all
my
classics
with
years
of
scribbling
in
the
margins
how
am
i
to
buy
them
again
you
rescued
mr
he
must
repay
biffen
had
already
laid
the
manuscript
on
the
table
it
was
dirty
and
crumpled
but
not
to
such
an
extent
as
to
render
copying
necessary
lovingly
he
smoothed
the
pages
and
set
them
in
order
then
he
wrapped
the
whole
in
a
piece
of
brown
paper
which
reardon
supplied
and
wrote
upon
it
the
address
of
a
firm
of
publishers
have
you
i
ll
write
to
them
impossible
to
call
in
my
present
indeed
his
attire
was
more
like
that
of
a
bankrupt
costermonger
than
of
a
man
of
letters
collar
he
had
none
for
the
griminess
of
that
he
wore
last
night
had
necessitated
its
being
thrown
aside
round
his
throat
was
a
dirty
handkerchief
his
coat
had
been
brushed
but
its
recent
experiences
had
brought
it
one
stage
nearer
to
that
dissolution
which
must
very
soon
be
its
fate
his
grey
trousers
were
now
black
and
his
boots
looked
as
if
they
had
not
been
cleaned
for
weeks
shall
i
say
anything
about
the
character
of
the
book
he
asked
seating
himself
with
pen
and
paper
shall
i
hint
that
it
deals
with
the
ignobly
decent
better
let
them
form
their
own
judgment
replied
reardon
in
his
hoarse
voice
then
i
ll
just
say
that
i
submit
to
them
a
novel
of
modern
life
the
scope
of
which
is
in
some
degree
indicated
by
its
title
pity
they
can
t
know
how
nearly
it
became
a
holocaust
and
that
i
risked
my
life
to
save
it
if
they
re
good
enough
to
accept
it
i
ll
tell
them
the
story
and
now
reardon
i
m
ashamed
of
myself
but
can
you
without
inconvenience
lend
me
ten
shillings
i
must
write
to
two
pupils
to
inform
them
of
my
change
of
address
from
garret
to
cellar
and
i
must
ask
help
from
my
prosperous
brother
he
gives
it
me
unreluctantly
i
know
but
i
am
always
loth
to
apply
to
him
may
i
use
your
paper
for
these
purposes
the
brother
of
whom
he
spoke
was
employed
in
a
house
of
business
at
liverpool
the
two
had
not
met
for
years
but
they
corresponded
and
were
on
terms
such
as
harold
indicated
when
he
had
finished
his
letters
and
had
received
the
from
reardon
he
went
his
way
to
deposit
the
parcel
at
the
publishers
the
clerk
who
received
it
from
his
hands
probably
thought
that
the
author
might
have
chosen
a
more
respectable
messenger
two
days
later
early
in
the
evening
the
friends
were
again
enjoying
each
other
s
company
in
reardon
s
room
both
were
invalids
for
biffen
had
of
course
caught
a
cold
from
his
exposure
in
on
the
roof
and
he
was
suffering
from
the
shock
to
his
nerves
but
the
thought
that
his
novel
was
safe
in
the
hands
of
publishers
gave
him
energy
to
resist
these
influences
the
absence
of
the
pipe
for
neither
had
any
palate
for
tobacco
at
present
was
the
only
external
peculiarity
of
this
meeting
there
seemed
no
reason
why
they
should
not
meet
frequently
before
the
parting
which
would
come
at
christmas
but
reardon
was
in
a
mood
of
profound
sadness
and
several
times
spoke
as
if
already
he
were
bidding
his
friend
farewell
i
find
it
difficult
to
think
he
said
that
you
will
always
struggle
on
in
such
an
existence
as
this
to
every
man
of
mettle
there
does
come
an
opportunity
and
it
surely
is
time
for
yours
to
present
itself
i
have
a
superstitious
faith
in
mr
if
he
leads
you
to
triumph
don
t
altogether
forget
don
t
talk
what
ages
it
seems
since
that
day
when
i
saw
you
in
the
library
at
hastings
and
heard
you
ask
in
vain
for
my
book
and
how
grateful
i
was
to
you
i
wonder
whether
any
mortal
ever
asks
for
my
books
nowadays
some
day
when
i
am
well
established
at
croydon
you
shall
go
to
mudie
s
and
make
inquiry
if
my
novels
ever
by
any
chance
leave
the
shelves
and
then
you
shall
give
me
a
true
and
faithful
report
of
the
answer
you
get
he
is
quite
forgotten
the
attendant
will
say
be
sure
of
i
think
to
have
had
even
a
small
reputation
and
to
have
outlived
it
is
a
sort
of
anticipation
of
death
the
man
edwin
reardon
whose
name
was
sometimes
spoken
in
a
tone
of
interest
is
really
and
actually
dead
and
what
remains
of
me
is
resigned
to
that
i
have
an
odd
fancy
that
it
will
make
death
itself
easier
it
is
as
if
only
half
of
me
had
now
to
biffen
tried
to
give
a
lighter
turn
to
the
gloomy
subject
thinking
of
my
fiery
adventure
he
said
in
his
tone
of
dry
deliberation
i
find
it
vastly
amusing
to
picture
you
as
a
witness
at
the
inquest
if
i
had
been
choked
and
consumed
no
doubt
it
would
have
been
made
known
that
i
rushed
upstairs
to
save
some
particular
piece
of
property
several
people
heard
me
say
so
and
you
alone
would
be
able
to
conjecture
what
this
was
imagine
the
gaping
wonderment
of
the
coroner
s
jury
the
daily
telegraph
would
have
made
a
leader
out
of
me
this
poor
man
was
so
strangely
deluded
as
to
the
value
of
a
novel
in
manuscript
which
it
appears
he
had
just
completed
that
he
positively
sacrificed
his
life
in
the
endeavour
to
rescue
it
from
the
and
the
saturday
would
have
had
a
column
of
sneering
jocosity
on
the
irrepressibly
sanguine
temperament
of
authors
at
all
events
i
should
have
had
my
day
of
but
what
an
ignoble
death
it
would
have
been
he
pursued
perishing
in
the
garret
of
a
which
caught
fire
by
the
overturning
of
a
drunkard
s
lamp
one
would
like
to
end
where
would
you
wish
to
die
asked
reardon
musingly
at
home
replied
the
other
with
pathetic
emphasis
i
have
never
had
a
home
since
i
was
a
boy
and
am
never
likely
to
have
one
but
to
die
at
home
is
an
unreasoning
hope
i
still
if
you
had
never
come
to
london
what
would
you
have
now
been
almost
certainly
a
schoolmaster
in
some
small
town
and
one
might
be
worse
off
than
that
you
yes
one
might
live
peaceably
enough
in
such
a
position
and
i
i
should
be
in
an
s
office
earning
a
sufficient
salary
and
most
likely
married
to
some
unambitious
country
girl
i
should
have
lived
an
intelligible
life
instead
of
only
trying
to
live
aiming
at
modes
of
life
beyond
my
reach
my
mistake
was
that
of
numberless
men
nowadays
because
i
was
conscious
of
brains
i
thought
that
the
only
place
for
me
was
london
it
s
easy
enough
to
understand
this
common
delusion
we
form
our
ideas
of
london
from
old
literature
we
think
of
london
as
if
it
were
still
the
one
centre
of
intellectual
life
we
think
and
talk
like
chatterton
but
the
truth
is
that
intellectual
men
in
our
day
do
their
best
to
keep
away
from
london
when
once
they
know
the
place
there
are
libraries
everywhere
papers
and
magazines
reach
the
north
of
scotland
as
soon
as
they
reach
brompton
it
s
only
on
rare
occasions
for
special
kinds
of
work
that
one
is
bound
to
live
in
london
and
as
for
recreation
why
now
that
no
english
theatre
exists
what
is
there
in
london
that
you
can
t
enjoy
in
almost
any
part
of
england
at
all
events
a
yearly
visit
of
a
week
would
be
quite
sufficient
for
all
the
special
features
of
the
town
london
is
only
a
huge
shop
with
an
hotel
on
the
upper
storeys
to
be
sure
if
you
make
it
your
artistic
subject
that
s
a
different
thing
but
neither
you
nor
i
would
do
that
by
deliberate
i
think
it
s
a
huge
misfortune
this
attraction
exercised
by
london
on
young
men
of
brains
they
come
here
to
be
degraded
or
to
perish
when
their
true
sphere
is
a
life
of
peaceful
remoteness
the
type
of
man
capable
of
success
in
london
is
more
or
less
callous
and
cynical
if
i
had
the
training
of
boys
i
would
teach
them
to
think
of
london
as
the
last
place
where
life
can
be
lived
and
the
place
where
you
are
most
likely
to
die
in
squalid
the
one
happy
result
of
my
experiences
said
reardon
is
that
they
have
cured
me
of
ambition
what
a
miserable
fellow
i
should
be
if
i
were
still
possessed
with
the
desire
to
make
a
name
i
can
t
even
recall
very
clearly
that
state
of
mind
my
strongest
desire
now
is
for
peaceful
obscurity
i
am
tired
out
i
want
to
rest
for
the
remainder
of
my
you
won
t
have
much
rest
at
oh
it
isn
t
impossible
my
time
will
be
wholly
occupied
in
a
round
of
all
but
mechanical
duties
and
i
think
that
will
be
the
best
medicine
for
my
mind
i
shall
read
very
little
and
that
only
in
the
classics
i
don
t
say
that
i
shall
always
be
content
in
such
a
position
in
a
few
years
perhaps
something
pleasanter
will
offer
but
in
the
meantime
it
will
do
very
well
then
there
is
our
expedition
to
greece
to
look
forward
to
i
am
quite
in
earnest
about
that
the
year
after
next
if
we
are
both
alive
assuredly
we
the
year
after
biffen
smiled
dubiously
i
have
demonstrated
to
you
mathematically
that
it
is
you
have
but
so
are
a
great
many
other
things
that
one
does
not
dare
to
hope
someone
knocked
at
the
door
opened
it
and
said
here
s
a
telegram
for
you
mr
the
friends
looked
at
each
other
as
if
some
fear
had
entered
the
minds
of
both
reardon
opened
the
despatch
it
was
from
his
wife
and
ran
thus
willie
is
ill
of
diphtheria
please
come
to
us
at
once
i
am
staying
with
mrs
carter
at
her
mother
s
at
the
full
address
was
given
you
hadn
t
heard
of
her
going
there
said
biffen
when
he
had
read
the
lines
no
i
haven
t
seen
carter
for
several
days
or
perhaps
he
would
have
told
me
brighton
at
this
time
of
year
but
i
believe
there
s
a
fashionable
season
about
now
isn
t
there
i
suppose
that
would
account
for
he
spoke
in
a
slighting
tone
but
showed
increasing
agitation
of
course
you
will
go
i
must
though
i
m
in
no
condition
for
making
a
his
friend
examined
him
anxiously
are
you
feverish
at
all
this
evening
reardon
held
out
a
hand
that
the
other
might
feel
his
pulse
the
beat
was
rapid
to
begin
with
and
had
been
heightened
since
the
arrival
of
the
telegram
but
go
i
must
the
poor
little
fellow
has
no
great
place
in
my
heart
but
when
amy
sends
for
me
i
must
go
perhaps
things
are
at
the
when
is
there
a
train
have
you
a
time
table
biffen
was
despatched
to
the
nearest
shop
to
purchase
one
and
in
the
meanwhile
reardon
packed
a
few
necessaries
in
a
small
ancient
and
worn
but
the
object
of
his
affection
because
it
had
accompanied
him
on
his
wanderings
in
the
south
when
harold
returned
his
appearance
excited
reardon
s
astonishment
he
was
white
from
head
to
foot
snow
it
must
have
been
falling
heavily
for
an
hour
or
can
t
be
helped
i
must
the
nearest
station
for
departure
was
london
bridge
and
the
next
train
left
at
by
reardon
s
watch
it
was
now
about
five
minutes
to
seven
i
don
t
know
whether
it
s
possible
he
said
in
confused
hurry
but
i
must
try
there
isn
t
another
train
till
ten
past
nine
come
with
me
to
the
station
both
were
ready
they
rushed
from
the
house
and
sped
through
the
soft
steady
fall
of
snowflakes
into
upper
street
here
they
were
several
minutes
before
they
found
a
disengaged
cab
questioning
the
driver
they
learnt
what
they
would
have
known
very
well
already
but
for
their
excitement
impossible
to
get
to
london
bridge
station
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
better
to
go
on
all
the
same
was
reardon
s
opinion
if
the
snow
gets
deep
i
shall
perhaps
not
be
able
to
have
a
cab
at
all
but
you
had
better
not
come
i
forgot
that
you
are
as
much
out
of
sorts
as
i
how
can
you
wait
a
couple
of
hours
alone
in
with
you
diphtheria
is
pretty
sure
to
be
fatal
to
a
child
of
that
age
isn
t
it
reardon
asked
when
they
were
speeding
along
city
road
i
m
afraid
there
s
much
why
did
she
send
what
an
absurd
question
you
seem
to
have
got
into
a
thoroughly
morbid
state
of
mind
about
her
do
be
human
and
put
away
your
obstinate
in
my
position
you
would
have
acted
precisely
as
i
have
done
i
have
had
no
i
might
but
we
have
both
of
us
too
little
practicality
the
art
of
living
is
the
art
of
compromise
we
have
no
right
to
foster
sensibilities
and
conduct
ourselves
as
if
the
world
allowed
of
ideal
relations
it
leads
to
misery
for
others
as
well
as
ourselves
genial
coarseness
is
what
it
behoves
men
like
you
and
me
to
cultivate
your
reply
to
your
wife
s
last
letter
was
preposterous
you
ought
to
have
gone
to
her
of
your
own
accord
as
soon
as
ever
you
heard
she
was
rich
she
would
have
thanked
you
for
such
disregard
of
delicacies
let
there
be
an
end
of
this
nonsense
i
implore
you
reardon
stared
through
the
glass
at
the
snow
that
fell
thicker
and
thicker
what
are
we
you
and
i
pursued
the
other
we
have
no
belief
in
immortality
we
are
convinced
that
this
life
is
all
we
know
that
human
happiness
is
the
origin
and
end
of
all
moral
considerations
what
right
have
we
to
make
ourselves
and
others
miserable
for
the
sake
of
an
obstinate
idealism
it
is
our
duty
to
make
the
best
of
circumstances
why
will
you
go
cutting
your
loaf
with
a
razor
when
you
have
a
serviceable
still
reardon
did
not
speak
the
cab
rolled
on
almost
silently
you
love
your
wife
and
this
summons
she
sends
is
proof
that
her
thought
turns
to
you
as
soon
as
she
is
in
perhaps
she
only
thought
it
her
duty
to
let
the
child
s
father
know
perhaps
perhaps
perhaps
cried
biffen
contemptuously
there
goes
the
razor
again
take
the
plain
human
construction
of
what
happens
ask
yourself
what
the
vulgar
man
would
do
and
do
likewise
that
s
the
only
safe
rule
for
they
were
both
hoarse
with
too
much
talking
and
for
the
last
half
of
the
drive
neither
spoke
at
the
they
ate
and
drank
together
but
with
poor
pretence
of
appetite
as
long
as
possible
they
kept
within
the
warmed
rooms
reardon
was
pale
and
had
anxious
restless
eyes
he
could
not
remain
seated
though
when
he
had
walked
about
for
a
few
minutes
the
trembling
of
his
limbs
obliged
him
to
sink
down
it
was
an
unutterable
relief
to
both
when
the
moment
of
the
train
s
starting
approached
they
clasped
hands
warmly
and
exchanged
a
few
last
requests
and
promises
forgive
my
plain
speech
old
fellow
said
biffen
go
and
be
happy
then
he
stood
alone
on
the
platform
watching
the
red
light
on
the
last
carriage
as
the
train
whirled
away
into
darkness
and
storm
chapter
xxxii
reardon
becomes
practical
reardon
had
never
been
to
brighton
and
of
his
own
accord
never
would
have
gone
he
was
prejudiced
against
the
place
because
its
name
has
become
suggestive
of
fashionable
imbecility
and
the
snobbishness
which
tries
to
model
itself
thereon
he
knew
that
the
town
was
a
mere
portion
of
london
transferred
to
the
and
as
he
loved
the
strand
and
the
breakers
for
their
own
sake
to
think
of
them
in
such
connection
could
be
nothing
but
a
trial
of
his
temper
something
of
this
species
of
irritation
affected
him
in
the
first
part
of
his
journey
and
disturbed
the
mood
of
kindliness
with
which
he
was
approaching
amy
but
towards
the
end
he
forgot
this
in
a
growing
desire
to
be
beside
his
wife
in
her
trouble
his
impatience
made
the
hour
and
a
half
seem
interminable
the
fever
which
was
upon
him
had
increased
he
coughed
frequently
his
breathing
was
difficult
though
constantly
moving
he
felt
as
if
in
the
absence
of
excitement
his
one
wish
would
have
been
to
lie
down
and
abandon
himself
to
lethargy
two
men
who
sat
with
him
in
the
carriage
had
spread
a
rug
over
their
knees
and
amused
themselves
with
playing
cards
for
trifling
sums
of
money
the
sight
of
their
foolish
faces
the
sound
of
their
laughs
the
talk
they
interchanged
exasperated
him
to
the
last
point
of
endurance
but
for
all
that
he
could
not
draw
his
attention
from
them
he
seemed
condemned
by
some
spiritual
tormentor
to
take
an
interest
in
their
endless
games
and
to
observe
their
visages
until
he
knew
every
line
with
a
hateful
intimacy
one
of
the
men
had
a
moustache
of
unusual
form
the
ends
curved
upward
with
peculiar
suddenness
and
reardon
was
constrained
to
speculate
as
to
the
mode
of
training
by
which
this
singularity
had
been
produced
he
could
have
shed
tears
of
nervous
distraction
in
his
inability
to
turn
his
thoughts
upon
other
things
on
alighting
at
his
journey
s
end
he
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
shivering
an
intense
and
sudden
chill
which
made
his
teeth
chatter
in
an
endeavour
to
overcome
this
he
began
to
run
towards
the
row
of
cabs
but
his
legs
refused
such
exercise
and
coughing
compelled
him
to
pause
for
breath
still
shaking
he
threw
himself
into
a
vehicle
and
was
driven
to
the
address
amy
had
mentioned
the
snow
on
the
ground
lay
thick
but
no
more
was
falling
heedless
of
the
direction
which
the
cab
took
he
suffered
his
physical
and
mental
unrest
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
then
a
stoppage
told
him
that
the
house
was
reached
on
his
way
he
had
heard
a
clock
strike
eleven
the
door
opened
almost
as
soon
as
he
had
rung
the
bell
he
mentioned
his
name
and
the
conducted
him
to
a
on
the
the
house
was
quite
a
small
one
but
seemed
to
be
well
furnished
one
lamp
burned
on
the
table
and
the
fire
had
sunk
to
a
red
glow
saying
that
she
would
inform
mrs
reardon
at
once
the
servant
left
him
alone
he
placed
his
bag
on
the
floor
took
off
his
muffler
threw
back
his
overcoat
and
sat
waiting
the
overcoat
was
new
but
the
garments
beneath
it
were
his
poorest
those
he
wore
when
sitting
in
his
garret
for
he
had
neither
had
time
to
change
them
nor
thought
of
doing
so
he
heard
no
approaching
footstep
but
amy
came
into
the
room
in
a
way
which
showed
that
she
had
hastened
downstairs
she
looked
at
him
then
drew
near
with
both
hands
extended
and
laid
them
on
his
shoulders
and
kissed
him
reardon
shook
so
violently
that
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
remain
standing
he
seized
one
of
her
hands
and
pressed
it
against
his
lips
how
hot
your
breath
is
she
said
and
how
you
tremble
are
you
ill
a
bad
cold
that
s
all
he
answered
thickly
and
coughed
how
is
willie
in
great
danger
the
doctor
is
coming
again
we
thought
that
was
his
you
didn
t
expect
me
i
couldn
t
feel
sure
whether
you
would
why
did
you
send
for
me
amy
because
willie
was
in
danger
and
you
felt
i
ought
to
know
about
it
yes
and
because
i
she
burst
into
tears
the
display
of
emotion
came
very
suddenly
her
words
had
been
spoken
in
a
firm
voice
and
only
the
pained
knitting
of
her
brows
had
told
what
she
was
suffering
if
willie
dies
what
shall
i
do
oh
what
shall
i
do
broke
forth
between
her
sobs
reardon
took
her
in
his
arms
and
laid
his
hand
upon
her
head
in
the
old
loving
way
do
you
wish
me
to
go
up
and
see
him
amy
of
course
but
first
let
me
tell
you
why
we
are
here
edith
mrs
carter
was
coming
to
spend
a
week
with
her
mother
and
she
pressed
me
to
join
her
i
didn
t
really
wish
to
i
was
unhappy
and
felt
how
impossible
it
was
to
go
on
always
living
away
from
you
oh
that
i
had
never
come
then
willie
would
have
been
as
well
as
tell
me
when
and
how
it
she
explained
briefly
then
went
on
to
tell
of
other
circumstances
i
have
a
nurse
with
me
in
the
room
it
s
my
own
bedroom
and
this
house
is
so
small
it
will
be
impossible
to
give
you
a
bed
here
edwin
but
there
s
an
hotel
only
a
few
yards
yes
yes
don
t
trouble
about
but
you
look
so
ill
you
are
shaking
so
is
it
a
cold
you
have
had
long
oh
my
old
habit
you
remember
one
cold
after
another
all
through
the
accursed
winter
what
does
that
matter
when
you
speak
kindly
to
me
once
more
i
had
rather
die
now
at
your
feet
and
see
the
old
gentleness
when
you
look
at
me
than
live
on
estranged
from
you
no
don
t
kiss
me
i
believe
these
vile
are
but
your
lips
are
so
hot
and
parched
and
to
think
of
your
coming
this
journey
on
such
a
night
good
old
biffen
came
to
the
station
with
me
he
was
angry
because
i
had
kept
away
from
you
so
long
have
you
given
me
your
heart
again
amy
oh
it
has
all
been
a
wretched
mistake
but
we
were
so
poor
now
all
that
is
over
if
only
willie
can
be
saved
to
me
i
am
so
anxious
for
the
doctor
s
coming
the
poor
little
child
can
hardly
draw
a
breath
how
cruel
it
is
that
such
suffering
should
come
upon
a
little
creature
who
has
never
done
or
thought
ill
you
are
not
the
first
dearest
who
has
revolted
against
nature
s
let
us
go
up
at
once
edwin
leave
your
coat
and
things
here
mrs
winter
edith
s
mother
is
a
very
old
lady
she
has
gone
to
bed
and
i
dare
say
you
wouldn
t
care
to
see
mrs
carter
no
no
only
you
and
when
the
doctor
comes
hadn
t
you
better
ask
his
advice
for
yourself
we
shall
see
don
t
trouble
about
they
went
softly
up
to
the
first
floor
and
entered
a
bedroom
fortunately
the
light
here
was
very
dim
or
the
nurse
who
sat
by
the
child
s
bed
must
have
wondered
at
the
eccentricity
with
which
her
patient
s
father
attired
himself
bending
over
the
little
sufferer
reardon
felt
for
the
first
time
since
willie
s
birth
a
strong
fatherly
emotion
tears
rushed
to
his
eyes
and
he
almost
crushed
amy
s
hand
as
he
held
it
during
the
spasm
of
his
intense
feeling
he
sat
here
for
a
long
time
without
speaking
the
warmth
of
the
chamber
had
the
reverse
of
an
assuaging
effect
upon
his
difficult
breathing
and
his
frequent
short
cough
it
seemed
to
oppress
and
confuse
his
brain
he
began
to
feel
a
pain
in
his
right
side
and
could
not
sit
upright
on
the
chair
amy
kept
regarding
him
without
his
being
aware
of
it
does
your
head
ache
she
whispered
he
nodded
but
did
not
speak
oh
why
doesn
t
the
doctor
come
i
must
send
in
a
few
but
as
soon
as
she
had
spoken
a
bell
rang
in
the
lower
part
of
the
house
amy
had
no
doubt
that
it
announced
the
promised
visit
she
left
the
room
and
in
a
minute
or
two
returned
with
the
medical
man
when
the
examination
of
the
child
was
over
reardon
requested
a
few
words
with
the
doctor
in
the
room
downstairs

ll

back
to
you
he
whispered
to
amy
the
two
descended
together
and
entered
the
is
there
any
hope
for
the
little
fellow
reardon
asked
yes
there
was
hope
a
favourable
turn
might
be
expected
now
i
wish
to
trouble
you
for
a
moment
on
my
own
account
i
shouldn
t
be
surprised
if
you
tell
me
that
i
have
congestion
of
the
the
doctor
a
suave
man
of
fifty
had
been
inspecting
his
interlocutor
with
curiosity
he
now
asked
the
necessary
questions
and
made
an
examination
have
you
had
any
lung
trouble
before
this
he
inquired
gravely
slight
congestion
of
the
right
lung
not
many
weeks
i
must
order
you
to
bed
immediately
why
have
you
allowed
your
symptoms
to
go
so
far
without
i
have
just
come
down
from
london
interrupted
reardon
tut

tut
to
bed
this
moment

dear
sir

inflammation
and
i
can

have
a
bed

the
nearest

the
one

my
wife

this
is
serious
wait
till
she
is
out
of
her
anxiety
about
the
you
will
need
the
services
of
a
nurse
a
most
unfortunate
thing
that
you
are
obliged
to
go
to
the
it
can
t
be
helped
if
a
nurse
is
necessary
i
must
engage
he
had
the
strange
sensation
of
knowing
that
whatever
was
needful
could
be
paid
for
it
relieved
his
mind
immensely
to
the
rich
illness
has
none
of
the
worst
horrors
only
understood
by
the
poor
don
t
speak
a
word
more
than
you
can
help
said
the
doctor
as
he
watched
reardon
withdraw
amy
stood
on
the
lower
stairs
and
came
down
as
soon
as
her
husband
showed
himself
the
doctor
is
good
enough
to
take
me
in
his
carriage
he
whispered
it
is
better
that
i
should
go
to
bed
and
get
a
good
night
s
rest
i
wish
i
could
have
sat
with
you
is
it
anything
you
look
worse
than
when
you
came
a
feverish
cold
don
t
give
it
a
thought
dearest
go
to
willie
she
threw
her
arms
about
him
i
shall
come
to
see
you
if
you
are
not
able
to
be
here
by
nine
in
the
morning
she
said
and
added
the
name
of
the
hotel
to
which
he
was
to
go
at
this
establishment
the
doctor
was
well
known
by
midnight
reardon
lay
in
a
comfortable
room
a
huge
cataplasm
fixed
upon
him
and
other
needful
arrangements
made
a
waiter
had
undertaken
to
visit
him
at
intervals
through
the
night
and
the
man
of
medicine
promised
to
return
as
soon
as
possible
after
daybreak
what
sound
was
that
soft
and
continuous
remote
now
clearer
now
confusedly
murmuring
he
must
have
slept
but
now
he
lay
in
sudden
perfect
consciousness
and
that
music
fell
upon
his
ears
ah
of
course
it
was
the
rising
tide
he
was
near
the
divine
sea
the
enabled
him
to
discern
the
principal
objects
in
the
room
and
he
let
his
eyes
stray
idly
hither
and
thither
but
this
moment
of
peacefulness
was
brought
to
an
end
by
a
fit
of
coughing
and
he
became
troubled
profoundly
troubled
in
mind
was
his
illness
really
dangerous
he
tried
to
draw
a
deep
breath
but
could
not
he
found
that
he
could
only
lie
on
his
right
side
with
any
ease
and
with
the
effort
of
turning
he
exhausted
himself
in
the
course
of
an
hour
or
two
all
his
strength
had
left
him
vague
fears
flitted
harassingly
through
his
thoughts
if
he
had
inflammation
of
the
lungs
that
was
a
disease
of
which
one
might
die
and
speedily
death
no
no
no
impossible
at
such
a
time
as
this
when
amy
his
own
dear
wife
had
come
back
to
him
and
had
brought
him
that
which
would
insure
their
happiness
through
all
the
years
of
a
long
life
he
was
still
quite
a
young
man
there
must
be
great
reserves
of
strength
in
him
and
he
had
the
will
to
live
the
prevailing
will
the
passionate
desire
of
happiness
how
he
had
alarmed
himself
why
now
he
was
calmer
again
and
again
could
listen
to
the
music
of
the
breakers
not
all
the
folly
and
baseness
that
paraded
along
this
strip
of
the
shore
could
change
the
sea
s
eternal
melody
in
a
day
or
two
he
would
walk
on
the
sands
with
amy
somewhere
quite
out
of
sight
of
the
repulsive
town
but
willie
was
ill
he
had
forgotten
that
poor
little
boy
in
future
the
child
should
be
more
to
him
though
never
what
the
mother
was
his
own
love
won
again
and
for
ever
again
an
interval
of
unconsciousness
brought
to
an
end
by
that
aching
in
his
side
he
breathed
very
quickly
could
not
help
doing
so
he
had
never
felt
so
ill
as
this
never
was
it
not
near
morning
then
he
dreamt
he
was
at
patras
was
stepping
into
a
boat
to
be
rowed
out
to
the
steamer
which
would
bear
him
away
from
greece
a
magnificent
night
though
at
the
end
of
december
a
sky
of
deep
blue
thick
set
with
stars
no
sound
but
the
steady
splash
of
the
oars
or
perhaps
a
voice
from
one
of
the
many
vessels
that
lay
anchored
in
the
harbour
each
showing
its
the
water
was
as
deep
a
blue
as
the
sky
and
sparkled
with
reflected
radiance
and
now
he
stood
on
deck
in
the
light
of
early
morning
southward
lay
the
ionian
islands
he
looked
for
ithaca
and
grieved
that
it
had
been
passed
in
the
hours
of
darkness
but
the
nearest
point
of
the
main
shore
was
a
rocky
promontory
it
reminded
him
that
in
these
waters
was
fought
the
battle
of
actium
the
glory
vanished
he
lay
once
more
a
sick
man
in
a
hired
chamber
longing
for
the
dull
english
dawn
at
eight
o
clock
came
the
doctor
he
would
allow
only
a
word
or
two
to
be
uttered
and
his
visit
was
brief
reardon
was
chiefly
anxious
to
have
news
of
the
child
but
for
this
he
would
have
to
wait
at
ten
amy
entered
the
bedroom
reardon
could
not
raise
himself
but
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
took
hers
and
gazed
eagerly
at
her
she
must
have
been
weeping
he
felt
sure
of
that
and
there
was
an
expression
on
her
face
such
as
he
had
never
seen
there
how
is
willie
better
dear
much
he
still
searched
her
face
ought
you
to
leave
him
hush
you
mustn
t
tears
broke
from
her
eyes
and
reardon
had
the
conviction
that
the
child
was
dead
the
truth
amy
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
by
the
bedside
and
pressed
her
wet
cheek
against
his
hand
i
am
come
to
nurse
you
dear
husband
she
said
a
moment
after
standing
up
again
and
kissing
his
forehead
i
have
only
you
his
heart
sank
and
for
a
moment
so
great
a
terror
was
upon
him
that
he
closed
his
eyes
and
seemed
to
pass
into
utter
darkness
but
those
last
words
of
hers
repeated
themselves
in
his
mind
and
at
length
they
brought
a
deep
solace
poor
little
willie
had
been
the
cause
of
the
first
coldness
between
him
and
amy
her
love
for
him
had
given
place
to
a
mother
s
love
for
the
child
now
it
would
be
as
in
the
first
days
of
their
marriage
they
would
again
be
all
in
all
to
each
other
you
oughtn
t
to
have
come
feeling
so
ill
she
said
to
him
you
should
have
let
me
know
he
smiled
and
kissed
her
hand
and
you
kept
the
truth
from
me
last
night
in
she
checked
herself
knowing
that
agitation
must
be
harmful
to
him
she
had
hoped
to
conceal
the
child
s
death
but
the
effort
was
too
much
for
her
overstrung
nerves
and
indeed
it
was
only
possible
for
her
to
remain
an
hour
or
two
by
this
for
she
was
exhausted
by
her
night
of
watching
and
the
sudden
agony
with
which
it
had
concluded
shortly
after
amy
s
departure
a
professional
nurse
came
to
attend
upon
what
the
doctor
had
privately
characterised
as
a
very
grave
case
by
the
evening
its
gravity
was
in
no
respect
diminished
the
sufferer
had
ceased
to
cough
and
to
make
restless
movements
and
had
become
lethargic
later
he
spoke
deliriously
or
rather
muttered
for
his
words
were
seldom
intelligible
amy
had
returned
to
the
room
at
four
o
clock
and
remained
till
far
into
the
night
she
was
physically
exhausted
and
could
do
little
but
sit
in
a
chair
by
the
bedside
and
shed
silent
tears
or
gaze
at
vacancy
in
the
woe
of
her
sudden
desolation
telegrams
had
been
exchanged
with
her
mother
who
was
to
arrive
in
brighton
morning
the
child
s
funeral
would
probably
be
on
the
third
day
from
this
when
she
rose
to
go
away
for
the
night
leaving
the
nurse
in
attendance
reardon
seemed
to
lie
in
a
state
of
unconsciousness
but
just
as
she
was
turning
from
the
bed
he
opened
his
eyes
and
pronounced
her
name
i
am
here
edwin
she
answered
bending
over
him
will
you
let
biffen
know
he
said
in
low
but
very
clear
tones
that
you
are
ill
dear
i
will
write
at
once
or
telegraph
if
you
like
what
is
his
address
he
had
closed
his
eyes
again
and
there
came
no
reply
amy
repeated
her
question
twice
she
was
turning
from
him
in
hopelessness
when
his
voice
became
audible
i
can
t
remember
his
new
address
i
know
it
but
i
can
t
she
had
to
leave
him
thus
the
next
day
his
breathing
was
so
harassed
that
he
had
to
be
raised
against
pillows
but
throughout
the
hours
of
daylight
his
mind
was
clear
and
from
time
to
time
he
whispered
words
of
tenderness
in
reply
to
amy
s
look
he
never
willingly
relinquished
her
hand
and
repeatedly
he
pressed
it
against
his
cheek
or
lips
vainly
he
still
endeavoured
to
recall
his
friend
s
address
couldn
t
mr
carter
discover
it
for
you
amy
asked
perhaps
you
might
she
would
have
suggested
applying
to
jasper
milvain
but
that
name
must
not
be
mentioned
whelpdale
also
would
perchance
know
where
biffen
lived
but
whelpdale
s
address
he
had
also
forgotten
at
night
there
were
long
periods
of
delirium
not
mere
confused
muttering
but
continuous
talk
which
the
listeners
could
follow
perfectly
for
the
most
part
the
sufferer
s
mind
was
occupied
with
revival
of
the
distress
he
had
undergone
whilst
making
those
last
efforts
to
write
something
worthy
of
himself
amy
s
heart
was
wrung
as
she
heard
him
living
through
that
time
of
supreme
misery
misery
which
she
might
have
done
so
much
to
alleviate
had
not
selfish
fears
and
irritated
pride
caused
her
to
draw
further
and
further
from
him
hers
was
the
kind
of
penitence
which
is
forced
by
sheer
stress
of
circumstances
on
a
nature
which
resents
any
form
of
humiliation
she
could
not
abandon
herself
to
unreserved
grief
for
what
she
had
done
or
omitted
and
the
sense
of
this
defect
made
a
great
part
of
her
affliction
when
her
husband
lay
in
mute
lethargy
she
thought
only
of
her
dead
child
and
mourned
the
loss
but
his
delirious
utterances
constrained
her
to
break
from
that
bittersweet
preoccupation
to
confuse
her
mourning
with
and
with
fears
though
unconsciously
he
was
addressing
her
i
can
do
no
more
amy
my
brain
seems
to
be
worn
out
i
can
t
compose
i
can
t
even
think
look
i
have
been
sitting
here
for
hours
and
i
have
done
only
that
little
bit
half
a
dozen
lines
such
poor
stuff
too
i
should
burn
it
only
i
can
t
afford
i
must
do
my
regular
quantity
every
day
no
matter
what
it
the
nurse
who
was
present
when
he
talked
in
this
way
looked
to
amy
for
an
explanation
my
husband
is
an
author
amy
answered
not
long
ago
he
was
obliged
to
write
when
he
was
ill
and
ought
to
have
been
i
always
thought
it
must
be
hard
work
writing
books
said
the
nurse
with
a
shake
of
her
head
you
don
t
understand
me
the
voice
pursued
dreadful
as
a
voice
always
is
when
speaking
independently
of
the
will
you
think
i
am
only
a
poor
creature
because
i
can
do
nothing
better
than
this
if
only
i
had
money
enough
to
rest
for
a
year
or
two
you
should
see
just
because
i
have
no
money
i
must
sink
to
this
degradation
and
i
am
losing
you
as
well
you
don
t
love
me
he
began
to
moan
in
anguish
but
a
happy
change
presently
came
over
his
dreaming
he
fell
into
animated
description
of
his
experiences
in
greece
and
italy
and
after
talking
for
a
long
time
he
turned
his
head
and
said
in
a
perfectly
natural
tone
amy
do
you
know
that
biffen
and
i
are
going
to
greece
she
believed
he
spoke
consciously
and
replied
you
must
take
me
with
you
he
paid
no
attention
to
this
remark
but
went
on
with
the
same
deceptive
accent
he
deserves
a
holiday
after
nearly
getting
burnt
to
death
to
save
his
novel
imagine
the
old
fellow
plunging
headlong
into
the
flames
to
rescue
his
manuscript
don
t
say
that
authors
can
t
be
heroic
and
he
laughed
gaily
another
morning
broke
it
was
possible
said
the
doctors
a
second
had
been
summoned
that
a
crisis
which
drew
near
might
bring
the
favourable
turn
but
amy
formed
her
own
opinion
from
the
way
in
which
the
nurse
expressed
herself
she
felt
sure
that
the
gravest
fears
were
entertained
before
noon
reardon
awoke
from
what
had
seemed
natural
sleep
save
for
the
rapid
breathing
and
of
a
sudden
recollected
the
number
of
the
house
in
cleveland
street
at
which
biffen
was
now
living
he
uttered
it
without
explanation
amy
at
once
conjectured
his
meaning
and
as
soon
as
her
surmise
was
confirmed
she
despatched
a
telegram
to
her
husband
s
friend
that
evening
as
amy
was
on
the
point
of
returning
to
the
after
having
dined
at
her
friend
s
house
it
was
announced
that
a
gentleman
named
biffen
wished
to
see
her
she
found
him
in
the
and
even
amid
her
distress
it
was
a
satisfaction
to
her
that
he
presented
a
far
more
conventional
appearance
than
in
the
old
days
all
the
garments
he
wore
even
his
hat
gloves
and
boots
were
new
a
surprising
state
of
things
explained
by
the
fact
of
his
commercial
brother
having
sent
him
a
present
of
ten
pounds
a
practical
expression
of
sympathy
with
him
in
his
recent
calamity
biffen
could
not
speak
he
looked
with
alarm
at
amy
s
pallid
face
in
a
few
words
she
told
him
of
reardon
s
condition
i
feared
this
he
replied
under
his
breath
he
was
ill
when
i
saw
him
off
at
london
bridge
but
willie
is
better
i
trust
amy
tried
to
answer
but
tears
filled
her
eyes
and
her
head
drooped
harold
was
overcome
with
a
sense
of
fatality
grief
and
dread
held
him
motionless
they
conversed
brokenly
for
a
few
minutes
then
left
the
house
biffen
carrying
the
with
which
he
had
travelled
hither
when
they
reached
the
hotel
he
waited
apart
until
it
was
ascertained
whether
he
could
enter
the
amy
rejoined
him
and
said
with
a
faint
smile
he
is
conscious
and
was
very
glad
to
hear
that
you
had
come
but
don
t
let
him
try
to
speak
the
change
that
had
come
over
his
friend
s
countenance
was
to
harold
of
course
far
more
gravely
impressive
than
to
those
who
had
watched
at
the
bedside
in
the
drawn
features
large
sunken
eyes
thin
and
discoloured
lips
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
read
too
surely
the
presage
of
doom
after
holding
the
shrunken
hand
for
a
moment
he
was
convulsed
with
an
agonising
sob
and
had
to
turn
away
amy
saw
that
her
husband
wished
to
speak
to
her
she
bent
over
him
ask
him
to
stay
dear
give
him
a
room
in
the
i
biffen
sat
down
by
the
bedside
and
remained
for
half
an
hour
his
friend
inquired
whether
he
had
yet
heard
about
the
novel
the
answer
was
a
shake
of
the
head
when
he
rose
reardon
signed
to
him
to
bend
down
and
whispered
it
doesn
t
matter
what
happens
she
is
mine
the
next
day
was
very
cold
but
a
blue
sky
gleamed
over
land
and
sea
the
drives
and
promenades
were
thronged
with
people
in
exuberant
health
and
spirits
biffen
regarded
this
spectacle
with
resentful
scorn
at
another
time
it
would
have
moved
him
merely
to
mirth
but
not
even
the
sound
of
the
breakers
when
he
had
wandered
as
far
as
possible
from
human
contact
could
help
him
to
think
with
resignation
of
the
injustice
which
triumphs
so
flagrantly
in
the
destinies
of
men
towards
amy
he
had
no
shadow
of
unkindness
the
sight
of
her
in
tears
had
impressed
him
as
profoundly
in
another
way
as
that
of
his
friend
s
wasted
features
she
and
reardon
were
again
one
and
his
love
for
them
both
was
stronger
than
any
emotion
of
tenderness
he
had
ever
known
in
the
afternoon
he
again
sat
by
the
bedside
every
symptom
of
the
sufferer
s
condition
pointed
to
an
approaching
end
a
face
that
had
grown
cadaverous
livid
lips
breath
drawn
in
hurrying
gasps
harold
despaired
of
another
look
of
recognition
but
as
he
sat
with
his
forehead
resting
on
his
hand
amy
touched
him
reardon
had
turned
his
face
in
their
direction
and
with
a
conscious
gaze
i
shall
never
go
with
you
to
greece
he
said
distinctly
there
was
silence
again
biffen
did
not
move
his
eyes
from
the
deathly
mask
in
a
minute
or
two
he
saw
a
smile
soften
its
lineaments
and
reardon
again
spoke
how
often
you
and
i
have
quoted
it
we
are
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
on
and
our
the
remaining
words
were
indistinguishable
and
as
if
the
effort
of
utterance
had
exhausted
him
his
eyes
closed
and
he
sank
into
lethargy
when
he
came
down
from
his
bedroom
on
the
following
morning
biffen
was
informed
that
his
friend
had
died
between
two
and
three
o
clock
at
the
same
time
he
received
a
note
in
which
amy
requested
him
to
come
and
see
her
late
in
the
afternoon
he
spent
the
day
in
a
long
walk
along
the
eastward
cliffs
again
the
sun
shone
brilliantly
and
the
sea
was
flecked
with
foam
upon
its
changing
green
and
azure
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
before
known
solitude
even
through
all
the
years
of
his
lonely
and
sad
existence
at
sunset
he
obeyed
amy
s
summons
he
found
her
calm
but
with
the
signs
of
long
weeping
at
the
last
moment
she
said
he
was
able
to
speak
to
me
and
you
were
mentioned
he
wished
you
to
have
all
that
he
has
left
in
his
room
at
islington
when
i
come
back
to
london
will
you
take
me
there
and
let
me
see
the
room
just
as
when
he
lived
in
it
let
the
people
in
the
house
know
what
has
happened
and
that
i
am
responsible
for
whatever
will
be
her
resolve
to
behave
composedly
gave
way
as
soon
as
harold
s
broken
voice
had
replied
hysterical
sobbing
made
further
speech
from
her
impossible
and
biffen
after
holding
her
hand
reverently
for
a
moment
left
her
alone
chapter
xxxiii
the
sunny
way
on
an
evening
of
early
summer
six
months
after
the
death
of
edwin
reardon
jasper
of
the
facile
pen
was
bending
over
his
desk
writing
rapidly
by
the
warm
western
light
which
told
that
sunset
was
near
not
far
from
him
sat
his
younger
sister
she
was
reading
and
the
book
in
her
hand
bore
the
title
mr
bailey
how
will
this
do
jasper
exclaimed
suddenly
throwing
down
his
pen
and
he
read
aloud
a
critical
notice
of
the
book
with
which
dora
was
occupied
a
notice
of
the
frankly
eulogistic
species
beginning
with
it
is
seldom
nowadays
that
the
luckless
reviewer
of
novels
can
draw
the
attention
of
the
public
to
a
new
work
which
is
at
once
powerful
and
original
and
ending
the
word
is
a
bold
one
but
we
do
not
hesitate
to
pronounce
this
book
a
is
that
for
the
current
asked
dora
when
he
had
finished
no
for
the
west
end
fadge
won
t
allow
anyone
but
himself
to
be
lauded
in
that
style
i
may
as
well
do
the
notice
for
the
current
now
as
i
ve
got
my
hand
he
turned
to
his
desk
again
and
before
daylight
failed
him
had
produced
a
piece
of
more
cautious
writing
very
favourable
on
the
whole
but
with
reserves
and
slight
censures
this
also
he
read
to
dora
you
wouldn
t
suspect
they
were
written
by
the
same
man
eh
no
you
have
changed
the
style
very
i
doubt
if
they
ll
be
much
use
most
people
will
fling
the
book
down
with
yawns
before
they
re
half
through
the
first
volume
if
i
knew
a
doctor
who
had
many
cases
of
insomnia
in
hand
i
would
recommend
mr
bailey
to
him
as
a
oh
but
it
is
really
clever
jasper
not
a
doubt
of
it
i
half
believe
what
i
have
written
and
if
only
we
could
get
it
mentioned
in
a
leader
or
two
and
so
on
old
biffen
s
fame
would
be
established
with
the
better
sort
of
readers
but
he
won
t
sell
three
hundred
copies
i
wonder
whether
robertson
would
let
me
do
a
notice
for
his
paper
biffen
ought
to
be
grateful
to
you
if
he
knew
said
dora
laughing
yet
now
there
are
people
who
would
cry
out
that
this
kind
of
thing
is
disgraceful
it
s
nothing
of
the
kind
speaking
seriously
we
know
that
a
really
good
book
will
more
likely
than
not
receive
fair
treatment
from
two
or
three
reviewers
yes
but
also
more
likely
than
not
it
will
be
swamped
in
the
flood
of
literature
that
pours
forth
week
after
week
and
won
t
have
attention
fixed
long
enough
upon
it
to
establish
its
repute
the
struggle
for
existence
among
books
is
nowadays
as
severe
as
among
men
if
a
writer
has
friends
connected
with
the
press
it
is
the
plain
duty
of
those
friends
to
do
their
utmost
to
help
him
what
matter
if
they
exaggerate
or
even
lie
the
simple
sober
truth
has
no
chance
whatever
of
being
listened
to
and
it
s
only
by
volume
of
shouting
that
the
ear
of
the
public
is
held
what
use
is
it
to
biffen
if
his
work
struggles
to
slow
recognition
ten
years
hence
besides
as
i
say
the
growing
flood
of
literature
swamps
everything
but
works
of
primary
genius
if
a
clever
and
conscientious
book
does
not
spring
to
success
at
once
there
s
precious
small
chance
that
it
will
survive
suppose
it
were
possible
for
me
to
write
a
round
dozen
reviews
of
this
book
in
as
many
different
papers
i
would
do
it
with
satisfaction
depend
upon
it
this
kind
of
thing
will
be
done
on
that
scale
before
long
and
it
s
quite
natural
a
man
s
friends
must
be
helped
by
whatever
means
as
biffen
himself
would
i
dare
say
he
doesn
t
even
think
of
you
as
a
friend
very
likely
not
it
s
ages
since
i
saw
him
but
there
s
much
magnanimity
in
my
character
as
i
have
often
told
you
it
delights
me
to
be
generous
whenever
i
can
afford
dusk
was
gathering
about
them
as
they
sat
talking
there
came
a
tap
at
the
door
and
the
summons
to
enter
was
obeyed
by
mr
whelpdale
i
was
passing
he
said
in
his
respectful
voice
and
couldn
t
resist
the
jasper
struck
a
match
and
lit
the
lamp
in
this
clearer
light
whelpdale
was
exhibited
as
a
young
man
of
greatly
improved
exterior
he
wore
a
waistcoat
a
necktie
of
subtle
hue
and
delicate
gloves
prosperity
breathed
from
his
whole
person
it
was
in
fact
only
a
moderate
prosperity
to
which
he
had
as
yet
attained
but
the
future
beckoned
to
him
flatteringly
early
in
this
year
his
enterprise
as
literary
adviser
had
brought
him
in
contact
with
a
man
of
some
pecuniary
resources
who
proposed
to
establish
an
agency
for
the
convenience
of
authors
who
were
not
skilled
in
disposing
of
their
productions
to
the
best
advantage
under
the
name
of
fleet
this
business
was
shortly
set
on
foot
and
whelpdale
s
services
were
retained
on
satisfactory
terms
the
birth
of
the
syndicate
system
had
given
new
scope
to
literary
agencies
and
mr
fleet
was
a
man
of
keen
eye
for
commercial
opportunities
well
have
you
read
biffen
s
book
asked
jasper
wonderful
isn
t
it
a
work
of
genius
i
am
convinced
ha
you
have
it
there
miss
dora
but
i
m
afraid
it
is
hardly
for
and
why
not
mr
whelpdale
you
should
only
read
of
beautiful
things
of
happy
lives
this
book
must
depress
but
why
will
you
imagine
me
such
a
person
asked
dora
you
have
so
often
spoken
like
this
i
have
really
no
ambition
to
be
a
doll
of
such
superfine
the
habitual
flatterer
looked
deeply
concerned
pray
forgive
me
he
murmured
humbly
leaning
forwards
towards
the
girl
with
eyes
which
deprecated
her
displeasure
i
am
very
far
indeed
from
attributing
weakness
to
you
it
was
only
the
natural
unreflecting
impulse
one
finds
it
so
difficult
to
associate
you
even
as
merely
a
reader
with
such
squalid
scenes
the
ignobly
decent
as
poor
biffen
calls
it
is
so
very
far
from
that
sphere
in
which
you
are
naturally
at
there
was
some
slight
affectation
in
his
language
but
the
tone
attested
sincere
feeling
jasper
was
watching
him
with
half
an
eye
and
glancing
occasionally
at
dora
no
doubt
said
the
latter
it
s
my
story
in
the
english
girl
that
inclines
you
to
think
me
a
sort
of
young
so
far
from
that
miss
dora
i
was
only
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
tell
you
how
exceedingly
delighted
i
have
been
with
the
last
two
weeks
instalments
in
all
seriousness
i
consider
that
story
of
yours
the
best
thing
of
the
kind
that
ever
came
under
my
notice
you
seem
to
me
to
have
discovered
a
new
genre
such
writing
as
this
has
surely
never
been
offered
to
girls
and
all
the
readers
of
the
paper
must
be
immensely
grateful
to
you
i
run
eagerly
to
buy
the
paper
each
week
i
assure
you
i
do
the
stationer
thinks
i
purchase
it
for
a
sister
i
suppose
but
each
section
of
the
story
seems
to
be
better
than
the
last
mark
the
prophecy
which
i
now
make
when
this
tale
is
published
in
a
volume
its
success
will
be
great
you
will
be
recognised
miss
dora
as
the
new
writer
for
modern
english
the
subject
of
this
panegyric
coloured
a
little
and
laughed
unmistakably
she
was
pleased
look
here
whelpdale
said
jasper
i
can
t
have
this
dora
s
conceit
please
to
remember
is
to
begin
with
only
a
little
less
than
my
own
and
you
will
make
her
unendurable
her
tale
is
well
enough
in
its
way
but
then
its
way
is
a
very
humble
i
deny
it
cried
the
other
excitedly
how
can
it
be
called
a
humble
line
of
work
to
provide
reading
which
is
at
once
intellectual
and
moving
and
exquisitely
pure
for
the
most
important
part
of
the
population
the
educated
and
refined
young
people
who
are
just
passing
from
girlhood
to
womanhood
the
most
important
fiddlestick
you
are
grossly
irreverent
my
dear
milvain
i
can
not
appeal
to
your
sister
for
she
s
too
modest
to
rate
her
own
sex
at
its
true
value
but
the
vast
majority
of
thoughtful
men
would
support
me
you
yourself
do
though
you
affect
this
profane
way
of
speaking
and
we
know
he
looked
at
dora
that
he
wouldn
t
talk
like
this
if
miss
yule
were
jasper
changed
the
topic
of
conversation
and
presently
whelpdale
was
able
to
talk
with
more
calmness
the
young
man
since
his
association
with
fleet
had
become
fertile
in
suggestions
of
literary
enterprise
and
at
present
he
was
occupied
with
a
project
of
special
hopefulness
i
want
to
find
a
capitalist
he
said
who
will
get
possession
of
that
paper
chat
and
transform
it
according
to
an
idea
i
have
in
my
head
the
thing
is
doing
very
indifferently
but
i
am
convinced
it
might
be
made
splendid
property
with
a
few
changes
in
the
way
of
conducting
the
paper
is
rubbish
remarked
jasper
and
the
kind
of
rubbish
oddly
enough
which
doesn
t
attract
precisely
but
the
rubbish
is
capable
of
being
made
a
very
valuable
article
if
it
were
only
handled
properly
i
have
talked
to
the
people
about
it
again
and
again
but
i
can
t
get
them
to
believe
what
i
say
now
just
listen
to
my
notion
in
the
first
place
i
should
slightly
alter
the
name
only
slightly
but
that
little
alteration
would
in
itself
have
an
enormous
effect
instead
of
chat
i
should
call
it
jasper
exploded
with
mirth
that
s
brilliant
he
cried
a
stroke
of
genius
are
you
serious
or
are
you
making
fun
of
me
i
believe
it
is
a
stroke
of
genius
chat
doesn
t
attract
anyone
but
would
sell
like
hot
cakes
as
they
say
in
america
i
know
i
am
right
laugh
as
you
on
the
same
principle
cried
jasper
if
the
tatler
were
changed
to
its
circulation
would
be
whelpdale
smote
his
knee
in
delight
an
admirable
idea
many
a
true
word
uttered
in
joke
and
this
is
an
instance
a
magnificent
title
the
very
thing
to
catch
the
dora
was
joining
in
the
merriment
and
for
a
minute
or
two
nothing
but
bursts
of
laughter
could
be
heard
now
do
let
me
go
on
implored
the
man
of
projects
when
the
noise
subsided
that
s
only
one
change
though
a
most
important
one
what
i
next
propose
is
this
i
know
you
will
laugh
again
but
i
will
demonstrate
to
you
that
i
am
right
no
article
in
the
paper
is
to
measure
more
than
two
inches
in
length
and
every
inch
must
be
broken
into
at
least
two
superb
but
you
are
joking
mr
whelpdale
exclaimed
dora
no
i
am
perfectly
serious
let
me
explain
my
principle
i
would
have
the
paper
address
itself
to
the
that
is
to
say
the
great
new
generation
that
is
being
turned
out
by
the
board
schools
the
young
men
and
women
who
can
just
read
but
are
incapable
of
sustained
attention
people
of
this
kind
want
something
to
occupy
them
in
trains
and
on
buses
and
trams
as
a
rule
they
care
for
no
newspapers
except
the
sunday
ones
what
they
want
is
the
lightest
and
frothiest
of
information
bits
of
stories
bits
of
description
bits
of
scandal
bits
of
jokes
bits
of
statistics
bits
of
foolery
am
i
not
right
everything
must
be
very
short
two
inches
at
the
utmost
their
attention
can
t
sustain
itself
beyond
two
inches
even
chat
is
too
solid
for
them
they
want
jasper
had
begun
to
listen
seriously
there
s
something
in
this
whelpdale
he
remarked
ha
i
have
caught
you
cried
the
other
delightedly
of
course
there
s
something
in
it
but
began
dora
and
checked
herself
you
were
going
to
say
whelpdale
bent
towards
her
with
deference
surely
these
poor
silly
people
oughtn
t
to
be
encouraged
in
their
whelpdale
s
countenance
fell
he
looked
ashamed
of
himself
but
jasper
came
speedily
to
the
rescue
that
s
twaddle
dora
fools
will
be
fools
to
the
world
s
end
answer
a
fool
according
to
his
folly
supply
a
simpleton
with
the
reading
he
craves
if
it
will
put
money
in
your
pocket
you
have
discouraged
poor
whelpdale
in
one
of
the
most
notable
projects
of
modern
i
shall
think
no
more
of
it
said
whelpdale
gravely
you
are
right
miss
again
jasper
burst
into
merriment
his
sister
reddened
and
looked
uncomfortable
she
began
to
speak
timidly
you
said
this
was
for
reading
in
trains
and
buses
whelpdale
caught
at
hope
yes
and
really
you
know
it
may
be
better
at
such
times
to
read
than
to
be
altogether
vacant
or
to
talk
unprofitably
i
am
not
sure
i
bow
to
your
opinion
so
long
as
they
only
read
the
paper
at
such
times
said
dora
still
hesitating
one
knows
by
experience
that
one
really
can
t
fix
one
s
attention
in
travelling
even
an
article
in
a
newspaper
is
often
too
exactly
and
if
you
find
it
so
what
must
be
the
case
with
the
mass
of
untaught
people
the
it
might
encourage
in
some
of
them
a
taste
for
reading
don
t
you
think
it
might
assented
dora
musingly
and
in
that
case
you
would
be
doing
good
distinct
good
they
smiled
joyfully
at
each
other
then
whelpdale
turned
to
jasper
you
are
convinced
that
there
is
something
in
this
seriously
i
think
there
is
it
would
all
depend
on
the
skill
of
the
fellows
who
put
the
thing
together
every
week
there
ought
always
to
be
one
strongly
sensational
item
we
won
t
call
it
article
for
instance
you
might
display
on
a
placard
what
the
queen
eats
or
how
gladstone
s
collars
are
made
things
of
that
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
and
then
you
know
added
whelpdale
glancing
anxiously
at
dora
when
people
had
been
attracted
by
these
devices
they
would
find
a
few
things
that
were
really
profitable
we
would
give
nicely
written
little
accounts
of
exemplary
careers
of
heroic
deeds
and
so
on
of
course
nothing
whatever
that
could
be
really
demoralising
va
sans
well
what
i
was
going
to
say
was
this
would
you
come
with
me
to
the
office
of
chat
and
have
a
talk
with
my
friend
lake
the
i
know
your
time
is
very
valuable
but
then
you
re
often
running
into
the
and
chat
is
just
upstairs
you
what
use
should
i
be
oh
all
the
use
in
the
world
lake
would
pay
most
respectful
attention
to
your
opinion
though
he
thinks
so
little
of
mine
you
are
a
man
of
note
i
am
nobody
i
feel
convinced
that
you
could
persuade
the
chat
people
to
adopt
my
idea
and
they
might
be
willing
to
give
me
a
contingent
share
of
contingent
profits
if
i
had
really
shown
them
the
way
to
a
good
jasper
promised
to
think
the
matter
over
whilst
their
talk
still
ran
on
this
subject
a
packet
that
had
come
by
post
was
brought
into
the
room
opening
it
milvain
exclaimed
ha
this
is
lucky
there
s
something
here
that
may
interest
you
proofs
yes
a
paper
i
have
written
for
the
he
looked
at
dora
who
smiled
how
do
you
like
the
title
the
novels
of
edwin
reardon
you
don
t
say
so
cried
the
other
what
a
fellow
you
are
milvain
now
that
s
really
a
kind
thing
to
have
done
by
jove
i
must
shake
hands
with
you
i
must
indeed
poor
reardon
poor
old
fellow
his
eyes
gleamed
with
moisture
dora
observing
this
looked
at
him
so
gently
and
sweetly
that
it
was
perhaps
well
he
did
not
meet
her
eyes
the
experience
would
have
been
altogether
too
much
for
him
it
has
been
written
for
three
months
said
jasper
but
we
have
held
it
over
for
a
practical
reason
when
i
was
engaged
upon
it
i
went
to
see
mortimer
and
asked
him
if
there
was
any
chance
of
a
new
edition
of
reardon
s
books
he
had
no
idea
the
poor
fellow
was
dead
and
the
news
seemed
really
to
affect
him
he
promised
to
consider
whether
it
would
be
worth
while
trying
a
new
issue
and
before
long
i
heard
from
him
that
he
would
bring
out
the
two
best
books
with
a
decent
cover
and
so
on
provided
i
could
get
my
article
on
reardon
into
one
of
the
monthlies
this
was
soon
settled
the
editor
of
the
wayside
answered
at
once
when
i
wrote
to
him
that
he
should
be
very
glad
to
print
what
i
proposed
as
he
had
a
real
respect
for
reardon
next
month
the
books
will
be
out
neutral
ground
and
hubert
mortimer
said
he
was
sure
these
were
the
only
ones
that
would
pay
for
themselves
but
we
shall
see
he
may
alter
his
opinion
when
my
article
has
been
read
it
to
us
now
jasper
will
you
asked
dora
the
request
was
supported
by
whelpdale
and
jasper
needed
no
pressing
he
seated
himself
so
that
the
lamplight
fell
upon
the
pages
and
read
the
article
through
it
was
an
excellent
piece
of
writing
see
the
wayside
june
and
in
places
touched
with
true
emotion
any
intelligent
reader
would
divine
that
the
author
had
been
personally
acquainted
with
the
man
of
whom
he
wrote
though
the
fact
was
nowhere
stated
the
praise
was
not
exaggerated
yet
all
the
best
points
of
reardon
s
work
were
admirably
brought
out
one
who
knew
jasper
might
reasonably
have
doubted
before
reading
this
whether
he
was
capable
of
so
worthily
appreciating
the
nobler
man
i
never
understood
reardon
so
well
before
declared
whelpdale
at
the
close
this
is
a
good
thing
well
done
it
s
something
to
be
proud
of
miss
yes
i
feel
that
it
is
she
replied
mrs
reardon
ought
to
be
very
grateful
to
you
milvain
do
you
ever
see
her
i
have
met
her
only
once
since
his
death
by
of
course
she
will
marry
again
i
wonder
who
ll
be
the
fortunate
man
fortunate
do
you
think
asked
dora
quietly
without
looking
at
him
oh
i
spoke
rather
cynically
i
m
afraid
whelpdale
hastened
to
reply
i
was
thinking
of
her
money
indeed
i
knew
mrs
reardon
only
very
i
don
t
think
you
need
regret
it
dora
remarked
oh
well
come
come
put
in
her
brother
we
know
very
well
that
there
was
little
enough
blame
on
her
there
was
great
blame
dora
exclaimed
she
behaved
shamefully
i
wouldn
t
speak
to
her
i
wouldn
t
sit
down
in
her
company
bosh
what
do
you
know
about
it
wait
till
you
are
married
to
a
man
like
reardon
and
reduced
to
utter
whoever
my
husband
was
i
would
stand
by
him
if
i
starved
to
if
he
you
i
am
not
talking
of
such
cases
mrs
reardon
had
never
anything
of
the
kind
to
fear
it
was
impossible
for
a
man
such
as
her
husband
to
behave
harshly
her
conduct
was
cowardly
faithless
unwomanly
trust
one
woman
for
thinking
the
worst
of
another
observed
jasper
with
something
like
a
sneer
dora
gave
him
a
look
of
strong
disapproval
one
might
have
suspected
that
brother
and
sister
had
before
this
fallen
into
disagreement
on
the
delicate
topic
whelpdale
felt
obliged
to
interpose
and
had
of
course
no
choice
but
to
support
the
girl
i
can
only
say
he
remarked
with
a
smile
that
miss
dora
takes
a
very
noble
point
of
view
one
feels
that
a
wife
ought
to
be
staunch
but
it
s
so
very
unsafe
to
discuss
matters
in
which
one
can
not
know
all
the
we
know
quite
enough
of
the
facts
said
dora
with
delightful
pertinacity
indeed
perhaps
we
do
assented
her
slave
then
turning
to
her
brother
well
once
more
i
congratulate
you
i
shall
talk
of
your
article
incessantly
as
soon
as
it
appears
and
i
shall
pester
every
one
of
my
acquaintances
to
buy
reardon
s
books
though
it
s
no
use
to
him
poor
fellow
still
he
would
have
died
more
contentedly
if
he
could
have
foreseen
this
biffen
will
be
profoundly
grateful
to
you
i
m
i
m
doing
what
i
can
for
him
too
run
your
eye
over
these
whelpdale
exhausted
himself
in
terms
of
satisfaction
you
deserve
to
get
on
my
dear
fellow
in
a
few
years
you
will
be
the
aristarchus
of
our
literary
when
the
visitor
rose
to
depart
jasper
said
he
would
walk
a
short
distance
with
him
as
soon
as
they
had
left
the
house
the
future
aristarchus
made
a
confidential
communication
it
may
interest
you
to
know
that
my
sister
maud
is
shortly
to
be
indeed
may
i
ask
to
whom
a
man
you
don
t
know
his
name
is
dolomore
a
fellow
in
rich
then
i
hope
tolerably
i
dare
say
he
has
three
or
four
thousand
a
year
gracious
heavens
why
that
s
but
whelpdale
did
not
look
quite
so
much
satisfaction
as
his
words
expressed
is
it
to
be
soon
he
inquired
at
the
end
of
the
season
make
no
difference
to
dora
and
me
of
oh
really
no
difference
at
all
you
will
let
me
come
and
see
you
both
just
in
the
old
way
milvain
why
the
deuce
shouldn
t
you
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
by
jove
i
really
don
t
know
how
i
should
get
on
if
i
couldn
t
look
in
of
an
evening
now
and
then
i
have
got
so
much
into
the
habit
of
it
and
i
m
a
lonely
beggar
you
know
i
don
t
go
into
society
and
really
he
broke
off
and
jasper
began
to
speak
of
other
things
when
milvain
the
house
dora
had
gone
to
her
own
it
was
not
quite
ten
o
clock
taking
one
set
of
the
proofs
of
his
reardon
article
he
put
it
into
a
large
envelope
then
he
wrote
a
short
letter
which
began
dear
mrs
reardon
and
ended
very
sincerely
yours
the
communication
itself
being
as
follows
i
venture
to
send
you
the
proofs
of
a
paper
which
is
to
appear
in
next
month
s
wayside
in
the
hope
that
it
may
seem
to
you
not
badly
done
and
that
the
reading
of
it
may
give
you
pleasure
if
anything
occurs
to
you
which
you
would
like
me
to
add
or
if
you
desire
any
omission
will
you
do
me
the
kindness
to
let
me
know
of
it
as
soon
as
possible
and
your
suggestion
shall
at
once
be
adopted
i
am
informed
that
the
new
edition
of
on
neutral
ground
and
hubert
reed
will
be
ready
next
month
need
i
say
how
glad
i
am
that
my
friend
s
work
is
not
to
be
forgotten
this
note
he
also
put
into
the
envelope
which
he
made
ready
for
posting
then
he
sat
for
a
long
time
in
profound
thought
shortly
after
eleven
his
door
opened
and
maud
came
in
she
had
been
dining
at
mrs
lane
s
her
attire
was
still
simple
but
of
quality
which
would
have
signified
recklessness
but
for
the
outlook
whereof
jasper
spoke
to
whelpdale
the
girl
looked
very
beautiful
there
was
a
flush
of
health
and
happiness
on
her
cheek
and
when
she
spoke
it
was
in
a
voice
that
rang
quite
differently
from
her
tones
of
a
year
ago
the
pride
which
was
natural
to
her
had
now
a
firm
support
she
moved
and
uttered
herself
in
queenly
fashion
has
anyone
been
she
asked
oh
i
wanted
to
ask
you
jasper
do
you
think
it
wise
to
let
him
come
quite
so
often
there
s
a
difficulty
you
see
i
can
hardly
tell
him
to
sheer
off
and
he
s
really
a
decent
that
may
be
but
i
think
it
s
rather
unwise
things
are
changed
in
a
few
months
dora
will
be
a
good
deal
at
my
house
and
will
see
all
sorts
of
yes
but
what
if
they
are
the
kind
of
people
she
doesn
t
care
anything
about
you
must
remember
old
girl
that
her
tastes
are
quite
different
from
yours
i
say
nothing
but
perhaps
it
s
as
well
they
should
you
say
nothing
but
you
add
an
insult
returned
maud
with
a
smile
of
superb
disregard
we
won
t
reopen
the
oh
dear
no
and
i
have
a
letter
from
dolomore
it
came
just
after
you
well
he
is
quite
willing
to
settle
upon
you
a
third
of
his
income
from
the
collieries
he
tells
me
it
will
represent
between
seven
and
eight
hundred
a
year
i
think
it
rather
little
you
know
but
i
congratulate
myself
on
having
got
this
out
of
don
t
speak
in
that
unpleasant
way
it
was
only
your
abruptness
that
made
any
kind
of
i
have
my
own
opinion
on
that
point
and
i
shall
beg
leave
to
keep
it
probably
he
will
think
me
still
more
abrupt
when
i
request
as
i
am
now
going
to
do
an
interview
with
his
is
that
allowable
asked
maud
anxiously
can
you
do
that
with
any
decency
if
not
then
i
must
do
it
with
indecency
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
remember
that
if
i
don
t
look
after
your
interests
no
one
else
will
it
s
perhaps
fortunate
for
you
that
i
have
a
good
deal
of
the
man
of
business
about
me
dolomore
thought
i
was
a
dreamy
literary
fellow
i
don
t
say
that
he
isn
t
entirely
honest
but
he
shows
something
of
a
disposition
to
play
the
autocrat
and
i
by
no
means
intend
to
let
him
if
you
had
a
father
dolomore
would
have
to
submit
his
affairs
to
examination
i
stand
to
you
in
loco
parentis
and
i
shall
bate
no
jot
of
my
but
you
can
t
say
that
his
behaviour
hasn
t
been
perfectly
i
don
t
wish
to
i
think
on
the
whole
he
has
behaved
more
honourably
than
was
to
be
expected
of
a
man
of
his
kind
but
he
must
treat
me
with
respect
my
position
in
the
world
is
greatly
superior
to
his
and
by
the
gods
i
will
be
treated
respectfully
it
wouldn
t
be
amiss
maud
if
you
just
gave
him
a
hint
to
that
all
i
have
to
say
is
jasper
don
t
do
me
an
irreparable
injury
you
might
without
meaning
no
fear
whatever
of
it
i
can
behave
as
a
gentleman
and
i
only
expect
dolomore
to
do
the
their
conversation
lasted
for
a
long
time
and
when
he
was
again
left
alone
jasper
again
fell
into
a
mood
of
thoughtfulness
by
a
late
post
on
the
following
day
he
received
this
letter
dear
mr
milvain
i
have
received
the
proofs
and
have
just
read
them
i
hasten
to
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
no
suggestion
of
mine
could
possibly
improve
this
article
it
seems
to
me
perfect
in
taste
in
style
in
matter
no
one
but
you
could
have
written
this
for
no
one
else
understood
edwin
so
well
or
had
given
such
thought
to
his
work
if
he
could
but
have
known
that
such
justice
would
be
done
to
his
memory
but
he
died
believing
that
already
he
was
utterly
forgotten
that
his
books
would
never
again
be
publicly
spoken
of
this
was
a
cruel
fate
i
have
shed
tears
over
what
you
have
written
but
they
were
not
only
tears
of
bitterness
it
can
not
but
be
a
consolation
to
me
to
think
that
when
the
magazine
appears
so
many
people
will
talk
of
edwin
and
his
books
i
am
deeply
grateful
to
mr
mortimer
for
having
undertaken
to
republish
those
two
novels
if
you
have
an
opportunity
will
you
do
me
the
great
kindness
to
thank
him
on
my
behalf
at
the
same
time
i
must
remember
that
it
was
you
who
first
spoke
to
him
on
this
subject
you
say
that
it
gladdens
you
to
think
edwin
will
not
be
forgotten
and
i
am
very
sure
that
the
friendly
office
you
have
so
admirably
performed
will
in
itself
reward
you
more
than
any
poor
expression
of
gratitude
from
me
i
write
hurriedly
anxious
to
let
you
hear
as
soon
as
possible
believe
me
dear
mr
milvain
yours
sincerely

a
check
marian
was
at
work
as
usual
in
the
she
did
her
best
during
the
hours
spent
here
to
convert
herself
into
the
literary
machine
which
it
was
her
hope
would
some
day
be
invented
for
construction
in
a
less
sensitive
material
than
human
tissue
her
eyes
seldom
strayed
beyond
the
limits
of
the
desk
and
if
she
had
occasion
to
rise
and
go
to
the
reference
shelves
she
looked
at
no
one
on
the
way
yet
she
herself
was
occasionally
an
object
of
interested
regard
several
readers
were
acquainted
with
the
chief
facts
of
her
position
they
knew
that
her
father
was
now
incapable
of
work
and
was
waiting
till
his
diseased
eyes
should
be
ready
for
the
operator
it
was
surmised
moreover
that
a
good
deal
depended
upon
the
girl
s
literary
exertions
mr
quarmby
and
his
gossips
naturally
took
the
darkest
view
of
things
they
were
convinced
that
alfred
yule
could
never
recover
his
sight
and
they
had
a
dolorous
satisfaction
in
relating
the
story
of
marian
s
legacy
of
her
relations
with
jasper
milvain
none
of
these
persons
had
heard
yule
had
never
spoken
of
that
matter
to
any
one
of
his
friends
jasper
had
to
look
in
this
morning
for
a
hurried
consultation
of
certain
encyclopaedic
volumes
and
it
chanced
that
marian
was
standing
before
the
shelves
to
which
his
business
led
him
he
saw
her
from
a
little
distance
and
paused
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
turn
back
for
a
moment
he
wore
a
look
of
doubt
and
worry
but
after
all
he
proceeded
at
the
sound
of
his
marian
started
she
was
standing
with
an
open
book
in
hand
and
looked
up
with
a
gleam
of
joy
on
her
face
i
wanted
to
see
you
she
said
subduing
her
voice
to
the
tone
of
ordinary
conversation
i
should
have
come
this
you
wouldn
t
have
found
me
at
home
from
five
to
seven
i
shall
be
frantically
busy
and
then
i
have
to
rush
off
to
dine
with
some
i
couldn
t
see
you
before
five
is
it
something
important
yes
it
i
tell
you
what
if
you
could
meet
me
at
gloucester
gate
at
four
then
i
shall
be
glad
of
half
an
hour
in
the
park
but
i
mustn
t
talk
now
i
m
driven
to
my
wits
end
gloucester
gate
at
four
sharp
i
don
t
think
it
ll
he
dragged
out
a
tome
of
the
marian
nodded
and
returned
to
her
seat
at
the
appointed
hour
she
was
waiting
near
the
entrance
of
regent
s
park
which
jasper
had
mentioned
not
long
ago
there
had
fallen
a
light
shower
but
the
sky
was
clear
again
at
five
minutes
past
four
she
still
waited
and
had
begun
to
fear
that
the
passing
rain
might
have
led
jasper
to
think
she
would
not
come
another
five
minutes
and
from
a
hansom
that
rattled
hither
at
full
speed
the
familiar
figure
alighted
do
forgive
me
he
exclaimed
i
couldn
t
possibly
get
here
before
let
us
go
to
the
they
betook
themselves
to
that
strip
of
the
park
which
skirts
the
canal
i
m
so
afraid
that
you
haven
t
really
time
said
marian
who
was
chilled
and
confused
by
this
show
of
hurry
she
regretted
having
made
the
appointment
it
would
have
been
much
better
to
postpone
what
she
had
to
say
until
jasper
was
at
leisure
yet
nowadays
the
hours
of
leisure
seemed
to
come
so
rarely
if
i
get
home
at
five
it
ll
be
all
right
he
replied
what
have
you
to
tell
me
marian
we
have
heard
about
the
money
at
oh
he
avoided
looking
at
her
and
what
s
the
upshot
i
shall
have
nearly
fifteen
hundred
so
much
as
that
well
that
s
better
than
nothing
isn
t
it
very
much
they
walked
on
in
silence
marian
stole
a
glance
at
her
companion
i
should
have
thought
it
a
great
deal
she
said
presently
before
i
had
begun
to
think
of
fifteen
hundred
well
it
means
fifty
pounds
a
year
i
he
chewed
the
end
of
his
moustache
let
us
sit
down
on
this
bench
fifteen
hundred
h
m
and
nothing
more
is
to
be
hoped
for
nothing
i
should
have
thought
men
would
wish
to
pay
their
debts
even
after
they
had
been
bankrupt
but
they
tell
us
we
can
t
expect
anything
more
from
these
you
are
thinking
of
walter
scott
and
that
kind
of
thing
jasper
laughed
oh
that
s
quite
unbusinesslike
it
would
be
setting
a
pernicious
example
nowadays
well
and
what
s
to
be
done
marian
had
no
answer
for
such
a
question
the
tone
of
it
was
a
new
stab
to
her
heart
which
had
suffered
so
many
during
the
past
now
i
ll
ask
you
frankly
jasper
went
on
and
i
know
you
will
reply
in
the
same
spirit
would
it
be
wise
for
us
to
marry
on
this
money
on
this
money
she
looked
into
his
face
with
painful
earnestness
you
mean
he
said
that
it
can
t
be
spared
for
that
purpose
what
she
really
meant
was
uncertain
even
to
herself
she
had
wished
to
hear
how
jasper
would
receive
the
news
and
thereby
to
direct
her
own
course
had
he
welcomed
it
as
offering
a
possibility
of
their
marriage
that
would
have
gladdened
her
though
it
would
then
have
been
necessary
to
show
him
all
the
difficulties
by
which
she
was
beset
for
some
time
they
had
not
spoken
of
her
father
s
position
and
jasper
seemed
willing
to
forget
all
about
that
complication
of
their
troubles
but
marriage
did
not
occur
to
him
and
he
was
evidently
quite
prepared
to
hear
that
she
could
no
longer
regard
this
money
as
her
own
to
be
freely
disposed
of
this
was
on
one
side
a
relief
but
on
the
other
it
confirmed
her
fears
she
would
rather
have
heard
him
plead
with
her
to
neglect
her
parents
for
the
sake
of
being
his
wife
love
excuses
everything
and
his
selfishness
would
have
been
easily
lost
sight
of
in
the
assurance
that
he
still
desired
her
you
say
she
replied
with
bent
head
that
it
would
bring
us
fifty
pounds
a
year
if
another
fifty
were
added
to
that
my
father
and
mother
would
be
supported
in
case
the
worst
comes
i
might
earn
fifty
you
wish
me
to
understand
marian
that
i
mustn
t
expect
that
you
will
bring
me
anything
when
we
are
his
tone
was
that
of
acquiescence
not
by
any
means
of
displeasure
he
spoke
as
if
desirous
of
saying
for
her
something
she
found
a
difficulty
in
saying
for
herself
jasper
it
is
so
hard
for
me
so
hard
for
me
how
could
i
help
remembering
what
you
told
me
when
i
promised
to
be
your
wife
i
spoke
the
truth
rather
brutally
he
replied
in
a
kind
voice
let
all
that
be
unsaid
forgotten
we
are
in
quite
a
different
position
now
be
open
with
me
marian
surely
you
can
trust
my
common
sense
and
good
feeling
put
aside
all
thought
of
things
i
have
said
and
don
t
be
restrained
by
any
fear
lest
you
should
seem
to
me
unwomanly
you
can
t
be
that
what
is
your
own
wish
what
do
you
really
wish
to
do
now
that
there
is
no
uncertainty
calling
for
postponements
marian
raised
her
eyes
and
was
about
to
speak
as
she
regarded
him
but
with
the
first
accent
her
look
fell
i
wish
to
be
your
he
waited
thinking
and
struggling
with
himself
yet
you
feel
that
it
would
be
heartless
to
take
and
use
this
money
for
our
own
purposes
what
is
to
become
of
my
parents
jasper
but
then
you
admit
that
the
fifteen
hundred
pounds
won
t
support
them
you
talk
of
earning
fifty
pounds
a
year
for
need
i
cease
to
write
dear
if
we
were
married
wouldn
t
you
let
me
help
them
but
my
dear
girl
you
are
taking
for
granted
that
we
shall
have
enough
for
i
didn
t
mean
at
once
she
explained
hurriedly
in
a
short
time
in
a
year
you
are
getting
on
so
well
you
will
soon
have
a
sufficient
income
i
am
jasper
rose
let
us
walk
as
far
as
the
next
seat
don
t
speak
i
have
something
to
think
moving
on
beside
him
she
slipped
her
hand
softly
within
his
arm
but
jasper
did
not
put
the
arm
into
position
to
support
hers
and
her
hand
fell
again
dropped
suddenly
they
reached
another
bench
and
again
became
seated
it
comes
to
this
marian
he
said
with
portentous
gravity
support
you
i
could
i
have
little
doubt
of
that
maud
is
provided
for
and
dora
can
make
a
living
for
herself
i
could
support
you
and
leave
you
free
to
give
your
parents
whatever
you
can
earn
by
your
own
work
but
he
paused
significantly
it
was
his
wish
that
marian
should
supply
the
consequence
but
she
did
not
speak
very
well
he
exclaimed
then
when
are
we
to
be
married
the
tone
of
resignation
was
too
marked
jasper
was
not
good
as
a
comedian
he
lacked
subtlety
we
must
wait
fell
from
marian
s
lips
in
the
whisper
of
despair
wait
but
how
long
he
inquired
dispassionately
do
you
wish
to
be
freed
from
your
engagement
jasper
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
reply
with
a
plain
yes
and
so
have
done
with
his
perplexities
he
feared
the
girl
s
face
and
he
feared
his
own
subsequent
emotions
don
t
talk
in
that
way
marian
the
question
is
simply
this
are
we
to
wait
a
year
or
are
we
to
wait
five
years
in
a
year
s
time
i
shall
probably
be
able
to
have
a
small
house
somewhere
out
in
the
suburbs
if
we
are
married
then
i
shall
be
happy
enough
with
so
good
a
wife
but
my
career
will
take
a
different
shape
i
shall
just
throw
overboard
certain
of
my
ambitions
and
work
steadily
on
at
earning
a
livelihood
if
we
wait
five
years
i
may
perhaps
have
obtained
an
editorship
and
in
that
case
i
should
of
course
have
all
sorts
of
better
things
to
offer
but
dear
why
shouldn
t
you
get
an
editorship
all
the
same
if
you
are
married
i
have
explained
to
you
several
times
that
success
of
that
kind
is
not
compatible
with
a
small
house
in
the
suburbs
and
all
the
ties
of
a
narrow
income
as
a
bachelor
i
can
go
about
freely
make
acquaintances
dine
at
people
s
houses
perhaps
entertain
a
useful
friend
now
and
then
and
so
on
it
is
not
merit
that
succeeds
in
my
line
it
is
merit
plus
opportunity
marrying
now
i
cut
myself
off
from
opportunity
that
s
she
kept
silence
decide
my
fate
for
me
marian
he
pursued
magnanimously
let
us
make
up
our
minds
and
do
what
we
decide
to
do
indeed
it
doesn
t
concern
me
so
much
as
yourself
are
you
content
to
lead
a
simple
unambitious
life
or
should
you
prefer
your
husband
to
be
a
man
of
some
distinction
i
know
so
well
what
your
own
wish
is
but
to
wait
for
years
you
will
cease
to
love
me
and
will
only
think
of
me
as
a
hindrance
in
your
well
now
when
i
said
five
years
of
course
i
took
a
round
number
three
two
might
make
all
the
difference
to
let
it
be
just
as
you
wish
i
can
bear
anything
rather
than
lose
your
you
feel
then
that
it
will
decidedly
be
wise
not
to
marry
whilst
we
are
still
so
poor
yes
whatever
you
are
convinced
of
is
he
again
rose
and
looked
at
his
watch
jasper
you
don
t
think
that
i
have
behaved
selfishly
in
wishing
to
let
my
father
have
the
money
i
should
have
been
greatly
surprised
if
you
hadn
t
wished
it
i
certainly
can
t
imagine
you
saying
oh
let
them
do
as
best
they
can
that
would
have
been
selfish
with
a
now
you
are
speaking
kindly
must
you
go
jasper
i
must
indeed
two
hours
work
i
am
bound
to
get
before
seven
o
and
i
have
been
making
it
harder
for
you
by
disturbing
your
no
no
it
s
all
right
now
i
shall
go
at
it
with
all
the
more
energy
now
we
have
come
to
a
dora
has
asked
me
to
go
to
kew
on
sunday
shall
you
be
able
to
come
dear
by
jove
no
i
have
three
engagements
on
sunday
afternoon
i
ll
try
and
keep
the
sunday
after
i
will
what
are
the
engagements
she
asked
timidly
as
they
walked
back
towards
gloucester
gate
he
answered
her
question
showing
how
unpardonable
it
would
be
to
neglect
the
people
concerned
then
they
parted
jasper
going
off
at
a
smart
pace
homewards
marian
turned
down
park
street
and
proceeded
for
some
distance
along
camden
road
the
house
in
which
she
and
her
parents
now
lived
was
not
quite
so
far
away
as
st
paul
s
crescent
they
rented
four
rooms
one
of
which
had
to
serve
both
as
alfred
yule
s
and
for
the
gatherings
of
the
family
at
meals
mrs
yule
generally
sat
in
the
kitchen
and
marian
used
her
bedroom
as
a
study
about
half
the
collection
of
books
had
been
sold
those
that
remained
were
still
a
respectable
library
almost
covering
the
walls
of
the
room
where
their
disconsolate
possessor
passed
his
mournful
days
he
could
read
for
a
few
hours
a
day
but
only
large
type
and
fear
of
consequences
kept
him
well
within
the
limit
of
such
indulgence
laid
down
by
his
advisers
though
he
inwardly
spoke
as
if
his
case
were
hopeless
yule
was
very
far
from
having
resigned
himself
to
this
conviction
indeed
the
prospect
of
spending
his
latter
years
in
darkness
and
idleness
was
too
dreadful
to
him
to
be
accepted
so
long
as
a
glimmer
of
hope
remained
he
saw
no
reason
why
the
customary
operation
should
not
restore
him
to
his
old
pursuits
and
he
would
have
borne
it
ill
if
his
wife
or
daughter
had
ever
ceased
to
oppose
the
despair
which
it
pleased
him
to
affect
on
the
whole
he
was
noticeably
patient
at
the
time
of
their
removal
to
these
lodgings
seeing
that
marian
prepared
herself
to
share
the
change
as
a
matter
of
course
he
let
her
do
as
she
would
without
comment
nor
had
he
since
spoken
to
her
on
the
subject
which
had
proved
so
dangerous
confidence
between
them
there
was
none
yule
addressed
his
daughter
in
a
grave
cold
civil
tone
and
marian
replied
gently
but
without
tenderness
for
mrs
yule
the
disaster
to
the
family
was
distinctly
a
gain
she
could
not
but
mourn
her
husband
s
affliction
yet
he
no
longer
visited
her
with
the
fury
or
contemptuous
impatience
of
former
days
doubtless
the
fact
of
needing
so
much
tendance
had
its
softening
influence
on
the
man
he
could
not
turn
brutally
upon
his
wife
when
every
hour
of
the
day
afforded
him
some
proof
of
her
absolute
devotion
of
course
his
exercise
was
still
unhindered
and
in
this
season
of
the
returning
sun
he
walked
a
great
deal
decidedly
to
the
advantage
of
his
general
health
which
again
must
have
been
a
source
of
benefit
to
his
temper
of
evenings
marian
sometimes
read
to
him
he
never
requested
this
but
he
did
not
reject
the
kindness
this
afternoon
marian
found
her
father
examining
a
volume
of
prints
which
had
been
lent
him
by
mr
quarmby
the
table
was
laid
for
dinner
owing
to
marian
s
frequent
absence
at
the
museum
no
change
had
been
made
in
the
order
of
meals
and
yule
sat
by
the
window
his
book
propped
on
a
second
chair
a
whiteness
in
his
eyes
showed
how
the
disease
was
progressing
but
his
face
had
a
more
wholesome
colour
than
a
year
ago
mr
hinks
and
mr
gorbutt
inquired
very
kindly
after
you
said
the
girl
as
she
seated
herself
oh
is
hinks
out
again
yes
but
he
looks
very
they
conversed
of
such
matters
until
mrs
yule
now
her
own
servant
brought
in
the
dinner
after
the
meal
marian
was
in
her
bedroom
for
about
an
hour
then
she
went
to
her
father
who
sat
in
idleness
smoking
what
is
your
mother
doing
he
asked
as
she
entered
some
i
had
perhaps
better
say
he
spoke
rather
stiffly
and
with
averted
face
that
i
make
no
exclusive
claim
to
the
use
of
this
room
as
i
can
no
longer
pretend
to
study
it
would
be
idle
to
keep
up
the
show
of
privacy
that
mustn
t
be
disturbed
perhaps
you
will
mention
to
your
mother
that
she
is
quite
at
liberty
to
sit
here
whenever
she
it
was
characteristic
of
him
that
he
should
wish
to
deliver
this
permission
by
proxy
but
marian
understood
how
much
was
implied
in
such
an
announcement
i
will
tell
mother
she
said
but
at
this
moment
i
wished
to
speak
to
you
privately
how
would
you
advise
me
to
invest
my
money
yule
looked
surprised
and
answered
with
cold
dignity
it
is
strange
that
you
should
put
such
a
question
to
me
i
should
have
supposed
your
interests
were
in
the
hands
of
of
some
competent
this
will
be
my
private
affair
father
i
wish
to
get
as
high
a
rate
of
interest
as
i
safely
i
really
must
decline
to
advise
or
interfere
in
any
way
but
as
you
have
introduced
this
subject
i
may
as
well
put
a
question
which
is
connected
with
it
could
you
give
me
any
idea
as
to
how
long
you
are
likely
to
remain
with
us
at
least
a
year
was
the
answer
and
very
likely
much
am
i
to
understand
then
that
your
marriage
is
indefinitely
postponed
yes
and
will
you
tell
me
why
i
can
only
say
that
it
has
seemed
better
to
both
of
yule
detected
the
sorrowful
emotion
she
was
endeavouring
to
suppress
his
conception
of
milvain
s
character
made
it
easy
for
him
to
form
a
just
surmise
as
to
the
reasons
for
this
postponement
he
was
gratified
to
think
that
marian
might
learn
how
rightly
he
had
judged
her
wooer
and
an
involuntary
pity
for
the
girl
did
not
prevent
his
hoping
that
the
detestable
alliance
was
doomed
with
difficulty
he
refrained
from
smiling
i
will
make
no
comment
on
that
he
remarked
with
a
certain
emphasis
but
do
you
imply
that
this
investment
of
which
you
speak
is
to
be
solely
for
your
own
advantage
for
mine
and
for
yours
and
mother
there
was
a
silence
of
a
minute
or
two
as
yet
it
had
not
been
necessary
to
take
any
steps
for
raising
money
but
a
few
months
more
would
see
the
family
without
resources
save
those
provided
by
marian
who
without
discussion
had
been
simply
setting
aside
what
she
received
for
her
work
you
must
be
well
aware
said
yule
at
length
that
i
can
not
consent
to
benefit
by
any
such
offer
when
it
is
necessary
i
shall
borrow
on
the
security
of
why
should
you
do
that
father
marian
interrupted
my
money
is
yours
if
you
refuse
it
as
a
gift
then
why
may
not
i
lend
to
you
as
well
as
a
stranger
repay
me
when
your
eyes
are
restored
for
the
present
all
our
anxieties
are
at
an
end
we
can
live
very
well
until
you
are
able
to
write
for
his
sake
she
put
it
in
his
way
supposing
him
never
able
to
earn
anything
then
indeed
would
come
a
time
of
hardship
but
she
could
not
contemplate
that
the
worst
would
only
befall
them
in
case
she
was
forsaken
by
jasper
and
if
that
happened
all
else
would
be
of
little
account
this
has
come
upon
me
as
a
surprise
said
yule
in
his
most
reserved
tone
i
can
give
no
definite
reply
i
must
think
of
should
you
like
me
to
ask
mother
to
bring
her
sewing
here
now
asked
marian
rising
yes
you
may
do
in
this
way
the
awkwardness
of
the
situation
was
overcome
and
when
marian
next
had
occasion
to
speak
of
money
matters
no
serious
objection
was
offered
to
her
proposal
dora
milvain
of
course
learnt
what
had
come
to
pass
to
anticipate
criticism
her
brother
imparted
to
her
the
decision
at
which
marian
and
he
had
arrived
she
reflected
with
an
air
of
discontent
so
you
are
quite
satisfied
was
her
question
at
length
that
marian
should
toil
to
support
her
parents
as
well
as
herself
can
i
help
it
i
shall
think
very
ill
of
you
if
you
don
t
marry
her
in
a
year
at
i
tell
you
marian
has
made
a
deliberate
choice
she
understands
me
perfectly
and
is
quite
satisfied
with
my
projects
you
will
have
the
kindness
dora
not
to
disturb
her
faith
in
i
agree
to
that
and
in
return
i
shall
let
you
know
when
she
begins
to
suffer
from
hunger
it
won
t
be
very
long
till
then
you
may
be
sure
how
do
you
suppose
three
people
are
going
to
live
on
a
hundred
a
year
and
it
s
very
doubtful
indeed
whether
marian
can
earn
as
much
as
fifty
pounds
never
mind
i
shall
let
you
know
when
she
is
beginning
to
starve
and
doubtless
that
will
amuse
at
the
end
of
july
maud
was
married
between
mr
dolomore
and
jasper
existed
no
superfluous
kindness
each
resenting
the
other
s
but
jasper
when
once
satisfied
of
his
proposed
s
straightforwardness
was
careful
not
to
give
offence
to
a
man
who
might
some
day
serve
him
provided
this
marriage
resulted
in
moderate
happiness
to
maud
it
was
undoubtedly
a
magnificent
stroke
of
luck
mrs
lane
the
lady
who
has
so
often
been
casually
mentioned
took
upon
herself
those
offices
in
connection
with
the
ceremony
which
the
bride
s
mother
is
wont
to
perform
at
her
house
was
held
the
and
such
other
absurdities
of
usage
as
recommend
themselves
to
society
dora
of
course
played
the
part
of
a
bridesmaid
and
jasper
went
through
his
duties
with
the
suave
seriousness
of
a
man
who
has
convinced
himself
that
he
can
not
afford
to
despise
anything
that
the
world
sanctions
about
the
same
time
occurred
another
event
which
was
to
have
more
importance
for
this
aspiring
little
family
than
could
as
yet
be
foreseen
whelpdale
s
noteworthy
idea
triumphed
the
weekly
paper
called
chat
was
thoroughly
transformed
and
appeared
as
from
the
first
number
the
success
of
the
enterprise
was
beyond
doubt
in
a
month
s
time
all
england
was
ringing
with
the
fame
of
this
noble
new
development
of
journalism
the
proprietor
saw
his
way
to
a
solid
fortune
and
other
men
who
had
money
to
embark
began
to
scheme
imitative
publications
it
was
clear
that
the
would
soon
be
abundantly
provided
with
literature
to
their
taste
whelpdale
s
exultation
was
unbounded
but
in
the
fifth
week
of
the
life
of
something
happened
which
threatened
to
overturn
his
sober
reason
jasper
was
walking
along
the
strand
one
afternoon
when
he
saw
his
ingenious
friend
approaching
him
in
a
manner
scarcely
to
be
accounted
for
unless
whelpdale
s
abstemiousness
had
for
once
given
way
before
convivial
invitation
the
young
man
s
hat
was
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
his
coat
flew
wildly
as
he
rushed
forwards
with
perspiring
face
and
glaring
eyes
he
would
have
passed
without
observing
jasper
had
not
the
latter
called
to
him
then
he
turned
round
laughed
insanely
grasped
his
acquaintance
by
the
wrists
and
drew
him
aside
into
a
court
what
do
you
think
he
panted
what
do
you
think
has
happened
not
what
one
would
suppose
i
hope
you
seem
to
have
gone
i
ve
got
lake
s
place
on
cried
the
other
hoarsely
two
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
lake
and
the
editor
quarrelled
pummelled
each
other
neither
know
nor
care
what
it
was
about
my
fortune
s
made
you
re
a
modest
man
remarked
jasper
smiling
certainly
i
am
i
have
always
admitted
it
but
remember
that
there
s
my
connection
with
fleet
as
well
no
need
to
give
that
up
presently
i
shall
be
making
a
clear
six
hundred
my
dear
sir
a
clear
six
hundred
if
a
penny
satisfactory
so
but
you
must
remember
that
i
m
not
a
big
gun
like
you
why
my
dear
milvain
a
year
ago
i
should
have
thought
an
income
of
two
hundred
a
glorious
competence
i
don
t
aim
at
such
things
as
are
fit
for
you
you
won
t
be
content
till
you
have
thousands
of
course
i
know
that
but
i
m
a
humble
fellow
yet
no
by
jingo
i
m
not
in
one
way
i
m
not
i
must
confess
in
what
instance
are
you
arrogant
i
can
t
tell
you
not
yet
this
is
neither
time
nor
place
i
say
when
will
you
dine
with
me
i
shall
give
a
dinner
to
half
a
dozen
of
my
acquaintances
somewhere
or
other
poor
old
biffen
must
come
when
can
you
dine
give
me
a
week
s
notice
and
i
ll
fit
it
that
dinner
came
duly
off
on
the
day
that
followed
jasper
and
dora
left
town
for
their
holiday
they
went
to
the
channel
islands
and
spent
more
than
half
of
the
three
weeks
they
had
allowed
themselves
in
sark
passing
over
from
guernsey
to
that
island
they
were
amused
to
see
a
copy
of
in
the
hands
of
an
obese
and
man
is
he
one
of
the
asked
dora
laughing
not
in
whelpdale
s
sense
of
the
word
but
strictly
speaking
no
doubt
he
is
the
constitute
a
very
large
class
indeed
how
large
the
huge
success
of
that
paper
is
demonstrating
i
ll
write
to
whelpdale
and
let
him
know
that
his
benefaction
has
extended
even
to
this
letter
was
written
and
in
a
few
days
there
came
a
reply
why
the
fellow
has
written
to
you
as
well
exclaimed
jasper
taking
up
a
second
letter
both
were
on
the
table
of
their
when
they
came
to
their
lodgings
for
lunch
that
s
his
it
looks
like
dora
hummed
an
air
as
she
regarded
the
envelope
then
she
took
it
away
with
her
to
her
room
upstairs
what
had
he
to
say
jasper
inquired
when
she
came
down
again
and
seated
herself
at
the
table
oh
a
friendly
letter
what
does
he
say
to
you
dora
had
never
looked
so
animated
and
fresh
of
colour
since
leaving
london
her
brother
remarked
this
and
was
glad
to
think
that
the
air
of
the
channel
should
be
doing
her
so
much
good
he
read
whelpdale
s
letter
aloud
it
was
facetious
but
oddly
respectful
the
reverence
that
fellow
has
for
me
is
astonishing
he
observed
with
a
laugh
the
queer
thing
is
it
increases
the
better
he
knows
dora
laughed
for
five
minutes
oh
what
a
splendid
epigram
she
exclaimed
it
is
indeed
a
queer
thing
jasper
did
you
mean
that
to
be
a
good
joke
or
was
it
better
still
by
coming
out
unintentionally
you
are
in
remarkable
spirits
old
girl
would
you
mind
letting
me
see
that
letter
of
yours
he
held
out
his
hand
i
left
it
upstairs
dora
replied
carelessly
rather
presumptuous
in
him
it
seems
to
oh
he
writes
quite
as
respectfully
to
me
as
he
does
to
you
she
returned
with
a
peculiar
smile
but
what
business
has
he
to
write
at
all
it
s
confounded
impertinence
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
shall
give
him
a
hint
to
remember
his
dora
could
not
be
quite
sure
whether
he
spoke
seriously
or
not
as
both
of
them
had
begun
to
eat
with
an
excellent
appetite
a
few
moments
were
allowed
to
pass
before
the
girl
again
spoke
his
position
is
as
good
as
ours
she
said
at
length
as
good
as
ours
the
of
a
paltry
rag
like
and
assistant
to
a
literary
agency
he
makes
considerably
more
money
than
we
money
what
s
money
dora
was
again
mirthful
oh
of
course
money
is
nothing
we
write
for
honour
and
glory
don
t
forget
to
insist
on
that
when
you
reprove
mr
whelpdale
no
doubt
it
will
impress
late
in
the
evening
of
that
day
when
the
brother
and
sister
had
strolled
by
moonlight
up
to
the
windmill
which
occupies
the
highest
point
of
sark
and
as
they
stood
looking
upon
the
pale
expanse
of
sea
dotted
with
the
gleam
of
near
and
far
dora
broke
the
silence
to
say
quietly
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
mr
whelpdale
wants
to
know
if
i
will
marry
the
deuce
he
does
cried
jasper
with
a
start
if
i
didn
t
half
suspect
something
of
that
kind
what
astounding
impudence
you
seriously
think
so
well
don
t
you
you
hardly
know
him
to
begin
with
and
then
oh
confound
it
very
well
i
ll
tell
him
that
his
impudence
astonishes
you
will
certainly
of
course
in
civil
terms
but
don
t
let
this
make
any
difference
between
you
and
him
just
pretend
to
know
nothing
about
it
no
harm
is
you
are
speaking
in
earnest
quite
he
has
written
in
a
very
proper
way
and
there
s
no
reason
whatever
to
disturb
our
friendliness
with
him
i
have
a
right
to
give
directions
in
a
matter
like
this
and
you
ll
please
to
obey
before
going
to
bed
dora
wrote
a
letter
to
mr
whelpdale
not
indeed
accepting
his
offer
forthwith
but
conveying
to
him
with
much
gracefulness
an
unmistakable
encouragement
to
persevere
this
was
posted
on
the
morrow
and
its
writer
continued
to
benefit
most
remarkably
by
the
sun
and
breezes
and
of
sark
soon
after
their
return
to
london
dora
had
the
satisfaction
of
paying
the
first
visit
to
her
sister
at
the
dolomores
house
in
ovington
square
maud
was
established
in
the
midst
of
luxuries
and
talked
with
laughing
scorn
of
the
days
when
she
inhabited
grub
street
her
literary
tastes
were
henceforth
to
serve
as
merely
a
note
of
distinction
an
added
grace
which
made
evident
her
superiority
to
the
and
people
among
whom
she
was
content
to
shine
on
the
one
hand
she
had
contact
with
the
world
of
fashionable
literature
on
the
other
with
that
of
fashionable
ignorance
mrs
lane
s
house
was
a
of
the
two
spheres
i
shan
t
be
there
very
often
remarked
jasper
as
dora
and
he
discussed
their
sister
s
magnificence
that
s
all
very
well
in
its
way
but
i
aim
at
something
so
do
i
dora
replied
i
m
very
glad
to
hear
that
i
confess
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
were
rather
too
cordial
with
whelpdale
one
must
behave
civilly
mr
whelpdale
quite
understands
you
are
sure
of
that
he
didn
t
seem
quite
so
gloomy
as
he
ought
to
have
the
success
of
keeps
him
in
good
it
was
perhaps
a
week
after
this
that
mrs
dolomore
came
quite
unexpectedly
to
the
house
by
regent
s
park
as
early
as
eleven
o
clock
in
the
morning
she
had
a
long
talk
in
private
with
dora
jasper
was
not
at
home
when
he
returned
towards
evening
dora
came
to
his
room
with
a
countenance
which
disconcerted
him
is
it
true
she
asked
abruptly
standing
before
him
with
her
hands
strained
together
that
you
have
been
representing
yourself
as
no
longer
engaged
to
marian
who
has
told
you
so
that
doesn
t
matter
i
have
heard
it
and
i
want
to
know
from
you
that
it
is
jasper
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
walked
apart
i
can
take
no
notice
he
said
with
indifference
of
anonymous
well
then
i
will
tell
you
how
i
have
heard
maud
came
this
morning
and
told
me
that
mrs
betterton
had
been
asking
her
about
it
mrs
betterton
had
heard
from
mrs
from
mrs
lane
and
from
whom
did
she
hear
pray
that
i
don
t
know
is
it
true
or
not
i
have
never
told
anyone
that
my
engagement
was
at
an
end
replied
jasper
deliberately
the
girl
met
his
eyes
then
i
was
right
she
said
of
course
i
told
maud
that
it
was
impossible
to
believe
this
for
a
moment
but
how
has
it
come
to
be
said
you
might
as
well
ask
me
how
any
lie
gets
into
circulation
among
people
of
that
sort
i
have
told
you
the
truth
and
there
s
an
end
of
dora
lingered
for
a
while
but
left
the
room
without
saying
anything
more
she
sat
up
late
mostly
engaged
in
thinking
though
at
times
an
open
book
was
in
her
hand
it
was
nearly
twelve
when
a
very
light
rap
at
the
door
caused
her
to
start
she
called
and
jasper
came
in
why
are
you
still
up
he
asked
avoiding
her
look
as
he
moved
forward
and
took
a
leaning
attitude
behind
an
oh
i
don
t
know
do
you
want
anything
there
was
a
pause
then
jasper
said
in
an
unsteady
voice
i
am
not
given
to
lying
dora
and
i
feel
confoundedly
uncomfortable
about
what
i
said
to
you
early
this
evening
i
didn
t
lie
in
the
ordinary
sense
it
s
true
enough
that
i
have
never
told
anyone
that
my
engagement
was
at
an
end
but
i
have
acted
as
if
it
were
and
it
s
better
i
should
tell
his
sister
gazed
at
him
with
indignation
you
have
acted
as
if
you
were
free
yes
i
have
proposed
to
miss
rupert
how
mrs
lane
and
that
lot
have
come
to
know
anything
about
this
i
don
t
understand
i
am
not
aware
of
any
connecting
link
between
them
and
the
ruperts
or
the
barlows
either
perhaps
there
are
none
most
likely
the
rumour
has
no
foundation
in
their
knowledge
still
it
is
better
that
i
should
have
told
you
miss
rupert
has
never
heard
that
i
was
engaged
nor
have
her
friends
the
barlows
at
least
i
don
t
see
how
they
could
have
done
she
may
have
told
mrs
barlow
of
my
proposal
probably
would
and
this
may
somehow
have
got
round
to
those
other
people
but
maud
didn
t
make
any
mention
of
miss
rupert
did
she
dora
replied
with
a
cold
negative
well
there
s
the
state
of
things
it
isn
t
pleasant
but
that
s
what
i
have
do
you
mean
that
miss
rupert
has
accepted
you
no
i
wrote
to
her
she
answered
that
she
was
going
to
germany
for
a
few
weeks
and
that
i
should
have
her
reply
whilst
she
was
away
i
am
but
what
name
is
to
be
given
to
behaviour
such
as
this
listen
didn
t
you
know
perfectly
well
that
this
must
be
the
end
of
it
do
you
suppose
i
thought
you
utterly
shameless
and
cruel
beyond
words
i
suppose
i
am
both
it
was
a
moment
of
desperate
temptation
though
i
had
dined
at
the
ruperts
you
remember
and
it
seemed
to
me
there
was
no
mistaking
the
girl
s
don
t
call
her
a
girl
broke
in
dora
scornfully
you
say
she
is
several
years
older
than
well
at
all
events
she
s
intellectual
and
very
rich
i
yielded
to
the
and
deserted
marian
just
when
she
has
most
need
of
help
and
consolation
it
s
frightful
jasper
moved
to
another
chair
and
sat
down
he
was
much
perturbed
look
here
dora
i
regret
it
i
do
indeed
and
what
s
more
if
that
woman
refuses
me
as
it
s
more
than
likely
she
will
i
will
go
to
marian
and
ask
her
to
marry
me
at
once
i
promise
his
sister
made
a
movement
of
contemptuous
impatience
and
if
the
woman
doesn
t
refuse
you
then
i
can
t
help
it
but
there
s
one
thing
more
i
will
say
whether
i
marry
marian
or
miss
rupert
i
sacrifice
my
strongest
feelings
in
the
one
case
to
a
sense
of
duty
in
the
other
to
worldly
advantage
i
was
an
idiot
to
write
that
letter
for
i
knew
at
the
time
that
there
was
a
woman
who
is
far
more
to
me
than
miss
rupert
and
all
her
money
a
woman
i
might
perhaps
marry
don
t
ask
any
questions
i
shall
not
answer
them
as
i
have
said
so
much
i
wished
you
to
understand
my
position
fully
you
know
the
promise
i
have
made
don
t
say
anything
to
marian
if
i
am
left
free
i
shall
marry
her
as
soon
as
and
so
he
left
the
room
for
a
fortnight
and
more
he
remained
in
uncertainty
his
life
was
very
uncomfortable
for
dora
would
only
speak
to
him
when
necessity
compelled
her
and
there
were
two
meetings
with
marian
at
which
he
had
to
act
his
part
as
well
as
he
could
at
length
came
the
expected
letter
very
nicely
expressed
very
friendly
very
complimentary
but
a
refusal
he
handed
it
to
dora
across
the
saying
with
a
pinched
smile
now
you
can
look
cheerful
again
i

chapter
xxxv
fever
and
rest
milvain
s
skilful
efforts
notwithstanding
mr
bailey
grocer
had
no
success
by
two
publishers
the
book
had
been
declined
the
firm
which
brought
it
out
offered
the
author
half
profits
and
fifteen
pounds
on
account
greatly
to
harold
biffen
s
satisfaction
but
reviewers
in
general
were
either
angry
or
coldly
contemptuous
let
mr
biffen
bear
in
mind
said
one
of
these
sages
that
a
novelist
s
first
duty
is
to
tell
a
mr
biffen
wrote
another
seems
not
to
understand
that
a
work
of
art
must
before
everything
else
afford
a
pretentious
book
of
the
genre
was
the
brief
comment
of
a
society
journal
a
weekly
of
high
standing
began
its
short
notice
in
a
rage
here
is
another
of
those
intolerable
productions
for
which
we
are
indebted
to
the
spirit
of
grovelling
realism
this
author
let
it
be
said
is
never
offensive
but
then
one
must
go
on
to
describe
his
work
by
a
succession
of
negatives
it
is
never
interesting
never
profitable
never
and
the
rest
the
eulogy
in
the
west
end
had
a
few
timid
echoes
that
in
the
current
would
have
secured
more
imitators
but
unfortunately
it
appeared
when
most
of
the
reviewing
had
already
been
done
and
as
jasper
truly
said
only
a
concurrence
of
powerful
testimonials
could
have
compelled
any
number
of
people
to
affect
an
interest
in
this
book
the
first
duty
of
a
novelist
is
to
tell
a
story
the
perpetual
repetition
of
this
phrase
is
a
warning
to
all
men
who
propose
drawing
from
the
life
biffen
only
offered
a
slice
of
biography
and
it
was
found
to
lack
flavour
he
wrote
to
mrs
reardon
i
can
not
thank
you
enough
for
this
very
kind
letter
about
my
book
i
value
it
more
than
i
should
the
praises
of
all
the
reviewers
in
existence
you
have
understood
my
aim
few
people
will
do
that
and
very
few
indeed
could
express
it
with
such
clear
if
amy
had
but
contented
herself
with
a
civil
acknowledgment
of
the
volumes
he
sent
her
she
thought
it
a
kindness
to
write
to
him
so
appreciatively
to
exaggerate
her
approval
the
poor
fellow
was
so
lonely
yes
but
his
loneliness
only
became
intolerable
when
a
beautiful
woman
had
smiled
upon
him
and
so
forced
him
to
dream
perpetually
of
that
supreme
joy
of
life
which
to
him
was
forbidden
it
was
a
fatal
day
that
on
which
amy
put
herself
under
his
guidance
to
visit
reardon
s
poor
room
at
islington
in
the
old
times
harold
had
been
wont
to
regard
his
friend
s
wife
as
the
perfect
woman
seldom
in
his
life
had
he
enjoyed
female
society
and
when
he
first
met
amy
it
was
years
since
he
had
spoken
with
any
woman
above
the
rank
of
a
keeper
or
a
her
beauty
seemed
to
him
of
a
very
high
order
and
her
mental
endowments
filled
him
with
an
exquisite
delight
not
to
be
appreciated
by
men
who
have
never
been
in
his
position
when
the
rupture
came
between
amy
and
her
husband
harold
could
not
believe
that
she
was
in
any
way
to
blame
held
to
reardon
by
strong
friendship
he
yet
accused
him
of
injustice
to
amy
and
what
he
saw
of
her
at
brighton
confirmed
him
in
this
judgment
when
he
accompanied
her
to
manville
street
he
allowed
her
of
course
to
remain
alone
in
the
room
where
reardon
had
lived
but
amy
presently
summoned
him
and
asked
him
questions
every
tear
she
shed
watered
a
growth
of
passionate
tenderness
in
the
solitary
man
s
heart
parting
from
her
at
length
he
went
to
hide
his
face
in
darkness
and
think
of
her
think
of
her
a
fatal
day
there
was
an
end
of
all
his
peace
all
his
capacity
for
labour
his
patient
endurance
of
penury
once
when
he
was
about
he
had
been
in
love
with
a
girl
of
gentle
nature
and
fair
intelligence
on
account
of
his
poverty
he
could
not
even
hope
that
his
love
might
be
returned
and
he
went
away
to
bear
the
misery
as
best
he
might
since
then
the
life
he
had
led
precluded
the
forming
of
such
attachments
it
would
never
have
been
possible
for
him
to
support
a
wife
of
however
humble
origin
at
intervals
he
felt
the
full
weight
of
his
loneliness
but
there
were
happily
long
periods
during
which
his
greek
studies
and
his
efforts
in
realistic
fiction
made
him
indifferent
to
the
curse
laid
upon
him
but
after
that
hour
of
intimate
speech
with
amy
he
never
again
knew
rest
of
mind
or
heart
accepting
what
reardon
had
bequeathed
to
him
he
removed
the
books
and
furniture
to
a
room
in
that
part
of
the
town
which
he
had
found
most
convenient
for
his
singular
tutorial
pursuits
the
winter
did
not
pass
without
days
of
all
but
starvation
but
in
march
he
received
his
fifteen
pounds
for
mr
bailey
and
this
was
a
fortune
putting
him
beyond
the
reach
of
hunger
for
full
six
months
not
long
after
that
he
yielded
to
a
temptation
that
haunted
him
day
and
night
and
went
to
call
upon
amy
who
was
still
living
with
her
mother
at
westbourne
park
when
he
entered
the
amy
was
sitting
there
alone
she
rose
with
an
exclamation
of
frank
pleasure
i
have
often
thought
of
you
lately
mr
biffen
how
kind
to
come
and
see
me
he
could
scarcely
speak
her
beauty
as
she
stood
before
him
in
the
graceful
black
dress
was
anguish
to
his
excited
nerves
and
her
voice
was
so
cruel
in
its
conventional
warmth
when
he
looked
at
her
eyes
he
remembered
how
their
brightness
had
been
dimmed
with
tears
and
the
sorrow
he
had
shared
with
her
seemed
to
make
him
more
than
an
ordinary
friend
when
he
told
her
of
his
success
with
the
publishers
she
was
delighted
oh
when
is
it
to
come
out
i
shall
watch
the
advertisements
so
will
you
allow
me
to
send
you
a
copy
mrs
reardon
can
you
really
spare
one
of
the
he
would
receive
he
scarcely
knew
how
to
dispose
of
three
and
amy
expressed
her
gratitude
in
the
most
charming
way
she
had
gained
much
in
point
of
manner
during
the
past
twelve
months
her
ten
thousand
pounds
inspired
her
with
the
confidence
necessary
to
a
perfect
demeanour
that
slight
hardness
which
was
wont
to
be
perceptible
in
her
tone
had
altogether
passed
away
she
seemed
to
be
cultivating
flexibility
of
voice
mrs
yule
came
in
and
was
all
graciousness
then
two
callers
presented
themselves
biffen
s
pleasure
was
at
an
end
as
soon
as
he
had
to
adapt
himself
to
polite
dialogue
he
escaped
as
speedily
as
possible
he
was
not
the
kind
of
man
that
deceives
himself
as
to
his
own
aspect
in
the
eyes
of
others
be
as
kind
as
she
might
amy
could
not
set
him
strutting
she
viewed
him
as
a
poor
devil
who
often
had
to
pawn
his
coat
a
man
of
parts
who
would
never
get
on
in
the
world
a
friend
to
be
thought
of
kindly
because
her
dead
husband
had
valued
him
nothing
more
than
that
he
understood
perfectly
the
limits
of
her
feeling
but
this
could
not
put
restraint
upon
the
emotion
with
which
he
received
any
most
trifling
utterance
of
kindness
from
her
he
did
not
think
of
what
was
but
of
what
under
changed
circumstances
might
be
to
encourage
such
fantasy
was
the
idlest
but
he
had
gone
too
far
in
this
form
of
indulgence
he
became
the
slave
of
his
inflamed
imagination
in
that
letter
with
which
he
replied
to
her
praises
of
his
book
perchance
he
had
allowed
himself
to
speak
too
much
as
he
thought
he
wrote
in
reckless
delight
and
did
not
wait
for
the
prudence
of
a
later
hour
when
it
was
past
recall
he
would
gladly
have
softened
many
of
the
expressions
the
letter
contained
i
value
it
more
than
the
praises
of
all
the
reviewers
in
existence
would
amy
be
offended
at
that
yours
in
gratitude
and
reverence
he
had
signed
himself
the
kind
of
phrase
that
comes
naturally
to
a
passionate
man
when
he
would
fain
say
more
than
he
dares
to
what
purpose
this
unless
indeed
he
wished
to
learn
once
and
for
ever
by
the
gentlest
of
repulses
that
his
homage
was
only
welcome
so
long
as
it
kept
well
within
conventional
terms
he
passed
a
month
of
distracted
idleness
until
there
came
a
day
when
the
need
to
see
amy
was
so
imperative
that
it
mastered
every
consideration
he
donned
his
best
clothes
and
about
four
o
clock
presented
himself
at
mrs
yule
s
house
by
ill
luck
there
happened
to
be
at
least
half
a
dozen
callers
in
the
the
strappado
would
have
been
preferable
in
his
eyes
to
such
an
ordeal
as
this
moreover
he
was
convinced
that
both
amy
and
her
mother
received
him
with
far
less
cordiality
than
on
the
last
occasion
he
had
expected
it
but
he
bit
his
lips
till
the
blood
came
what
business
had
he
among
people
of
this
kind
no
doubt
the
visitors
wondered
at
his
comparative
shabbiness
and
asked
themselves
how
he
ventured
to
make
a
call
without
the
regulation
hat
it
was
a
wretched
and
foolish
mistake
ten
minutes
saw
him
in
the
street
again
vowing
that
he
would
never
approach
amy
more
not
that
he
found
fault
with
her
the
blame
was
entirely
his
own
he
lived
on
the
third
floor
of
a
house
in
goodge
street
above
a
baker
s
shop
the
bequest
of
reardon
s
furniture
was
a
great
advantage
to
him
as
he
had
only
to
pay
rent
for
a
bare
room
the
books
too
came
as
a
godsend
since
the
destruction
of
his
own
he
had
now
only
one
pupil
and
was
not
exerting
himself
to
find
others
his
old
energy
had
forsaken
him
for
the
failure
of
his
book
he
cared
nothing
it
was
no
more
than
he
anticipated
the
work
was
done
the
best
he
was
capable
of
and
this
satisfied
him
it
was
doubtful
whether
he
loved
amy
in
the
true
sense
of
exclusive
desire
she
represented
for
him
all
that
is
lovely
in
womanhood
to
his
starved
soul
and
senses
she
was
woman
the
complement
of
his
frustrate
being
circumstance
had
made
her
the
means
of
exciting
in
him
that
natural
force
which
had
hitherto
either
been
dormant
or
had
yielded
to
the
resolute
will
companionless
inert
he
suffered
the
tortures
which
are
so
ludicrous
and
contemptible
to
the
happily
married
life
was
barren
to
him
and
would
soon
grow
hateful
only
in
sleep
could
he
cast
off
the
unchanging
thoughts
and
desires
which
made
all
else
meaningless
and
rightly
meaningless
he
revolted
against
the
unnatural
constraints
forbidding
him
to
complete
his
manhood
by
what
fatality
was
he
alone
of
men
withheld
from
the
winning
of
a
woman
s
love
he
could
not
bear
to
walk
the
streets
where
the
faces
of
beautiful
women
would
encounter
him
when
he
must
needs
leave
the
house
he
went
about
in
the
poor
narrow
ways
where
only
spectacles
of
coarseness
and
want
and
toil
would
be
presented
to
him
yet
even
here
he
was
too
often
reminded
that
the
of
the
class
to
which
poverty
is
natural
were
not
condemned
to
endure
in
solitude
only
he
who
belonged
to
no
class
who
was
rejected
alike
by
his
fellows
in
privation
and
by
his
equals
in
intellect
must
die
without
having
known
the
touch
of
a
loving
woman
s
hand
the
summer
went
by
and
he
was
unconscious
of
its
warmth
and
light
how
his
days
passed
he
could
not
have
said
one
evening
in
early
autumn
as
he
stood
before
the
at
the
end
of
goodge
street
a
familiar
voice
accosted
him
it
was
whelpdale
s
a
month
or
two
ago
he
had
stubbornly
refused
an
invitation
to
dine
with
whelpdale
and
other
acquaintances
you
remember
what
the
occasion
was
and
since
then
the
prosperous
young
man
had
not
crossed
his
path
i
ve
something
to
tell
you
said
the
assailer
taking
hold
of
his
arm
i
m
in
a
tremendous
state
of
mind
and
want
someone
to
share
my
delight
you
can
walk
a
short
way
i
hope
not
too
busy
with
some
new
book
biffen
gave
no
answer
but
went
whither
he
was
led
you
are
writing
a
new
book
i
suppose
don
t
be
discouraged
old
fellow
mr
bailey
will
have
his
day
yet
i
know
men
who
consider
it
an
undoubted
work
of
genius
what
s
the
next
to
deal
with
i
haven
t
decided
yet
replied
harold
merely
to
avoid
argument
he
spoke
so
seldom
that
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
was
strange
to
him
thinking
over
it
i
suppose
in
your
usual
solid
way
don
t
be
hurried
but
i
must
tell
you
of
this
affair
of
mine
you
know
dora
milvain
i
have
asked
her
to
marry
me
and
by
the
powers
she
has
given
me
an
encouraging
answer
not
an
actual
yes
but
encouraging
she
s
away
in
the
channel
islands
and
i
wrote
he
talked
on
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
with
a
sudden
movement
the
listener
freed
himself
i
can
t
go
any
farther
he
said
hoarsely
whelpdale
was
disconcerted
i
have
been
boring
you
that
s
a
confounded
fault
of
mine
i
know
biffen
had
waved
his
hand
and
was
gone
a
week
or
two
more
would
see
him
at
the
end
of
his
money
he
had
no
lessons
now
and
could
not
write
from
his
novel
nothing
was
to
be
expected
he
might
apply
again
to
his
brother
but
such
dependence
was
unjust
and
unworthy
and
why
should
he
struggle
to
preserve
a
life
which
had
no
prospect
but
of
misery
it
was
in
the
hours
following
his
encounter
with
whelpdale
that
he
first
knew
the
actual
desire
of
death
the
simple
longing
for
extinction
one
must
go
far
in
suffering
before
the
innate
is
thus
truly
overcome
weariness
of
bodily
anguish
may
induce
this
perversion
of
the
instincts
less
often
that
despair
of
suppressed
emotion
which
had
fallen
upon
harold
through
the
night
he
kept
his
thoughts
fixed
on
death
in
its
aspect
of
repose
of
eternal
oblivion
and
herein
he
had
found
solace
the
next
night
it
was
the
same
moving
about
among
common
needs
and
occupations
he
knew
not
a
moment
s
cessation
of
but
when
he
lay
down
in
the
darkness
a
hopeful
summons
whispered
to
him
night
which
had
been
the
worst
season
of
his
pain
had
now
grown
friendly
it
came
as
an
anticipation
of
the
sleep
that
is
everlasting
a
few
more
days
and
he
was
possessed
by
a
calm
of
spirit
such
as
he
had
never
known
his
resolve
was
taken
not
in
a
moment
of
supreme
conflict
but
as
the
result
of
a
subtle
process
by
which
his
imagination
had
become
in
love
with
death
turning
from
contemplation
of
life
s
one
rapture
he
looked
with
the
same
intensity
of
desire
to
a
state
that
had
neither
fear
nor
hope
one
afternoon
he
went
to
the
museum
and
was
busy
for
a
few
minutes
in
consultation
of
a
volume
which
he
took
from
the
shelves
of
medical
literature
on
his
way
homeward
he
entered
two
or
three
chemists
shops
something
of
which
he
had
need
could
be
procured
only
in
very
small
quantities
but
repetition
of
his
demand
in
different
places
supplied
him
sufficiently
when
he
reached
his
room
he
emptied
the
contents
of
sundry
little
bottles
into
one
larger
and
put
this
in
his
pocket
then
he
wrote
rather
a
long
letter
addressed
to
his
brother
at
liverpool
it
had
been
a
beautiful
day
and
there
wanted
still
a
couple
of
hours
before
the
warm
golden
sunlight
would
disappear
harold
stood
and
looked
round
his
room
as
always
it
presented
a
neat
orderly
aspect
but
his
eye
caught
sight
of
a
volume
which
stood
upside
down
and
this
fault
particularly
hateful
to
a
bookish
man
he
rectified
he
put
his
square
on
the
table
closed
the
lid
of
the
inkstand
arranged
his
pens
then
he
took
his
hat
and
stick
locked
the
door
behind
him
and
went
downstairs
at
the
foot
he
spoke
to
his
landlady
and
told
her
that
he
should
not
return
that
night
as
soon
as
possible
after
leaving
the
house
he
posted
his
letter
his
direction
was
westward
walking
at
a
steady
purposeful
pace
with
cheery
countenance
and
eyes
that
gave
sign
of
pleasure
as
often
as
they
turned
to
the
clouds
he
struck
across
kensington
gardens
and
then
on
towards
fulham
where
he
crossed
the
thames
to
putney
the
sun
was
just
setting
he
paused
a
few
moments
on
the
bridge
watching
the
river
with
a
quiet
smile
and
enjoying
the
splendour
of
the
sky
up
putney
hill
he
walked
slowly
when
he
reached
the
top
it
was
growing
dark
but
an
unwonted
effect
in
the
atmosphere
caused
him
to
turn
and
look
to
the
east
an
exclamation
escaped
his
lips
for
there
before
him
was
the
moon
a
perfect
globe
vast
and
red
he
gazed
at
it
for
a
long
time
when
the
daylight
had
entirely
passed
he
went
forward
on
to
the
heath
and
rambled
as
if
idly
to
a
secluded
part
where
trees
and
bushes
made
a
deep
shadow
under
the
full
moon
it
was
still
quite
warm
and
scarcely
a
breath
of
air
moved
among
the
reddening
leaves
sure
at
length
that
he
was
remote
from
all
observation
he
pressed
into
a
little
copse
and
there
reclined
on
the
grass
leaning
against
the
stem
of
a
tree
the
moon
was
now
hidden
from
him
but
by
looking
upward
he
could
see
its
light
upon
a
long
faint
cloud
and
the
blue
of
the
placid
sky
his
mood
was
one
of
ineffable
peace
only
thoughts
of
beautiful
things
came
into
his
mind
he
had
reverted
to
an
earlier
period
of
life
when
as
yet
no
mission
of
literary
realism
had
been
imposed
upon
him
and
when
his
passions
were
still
soothed
by
natural
hope
the
memory
of
his
friend
reardon
was
strongly
present
with
him
but
of
amy
he
thought
only
as
of
that
star
which
had
just
come
into
his
vision
above
the
edge
of
dark
foliage
beautiful
but
infinitely
remote
recalling
reardon
s
voice
it
brought
to
him
those
last
words
whispered
by
his
dying
companion
he
remembered
them
now
we
are
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
on
and
our
little
life
is
rounded
with
a
sleep
chapter
xxxvi
jasper
s
delicate
case
only
when
he
received
miss
rupert
s
refusal
to
become
his
wife
was
jasper
aware
how
firmly
he
had
counted
on
her
accepting
him
he
told
dora
with
sincerity
that
his
proposal
was
a
piece
of
foolishness
so
far
from
having
any
regard
for
miss
rupert
he
felt
towards
her
with
something
of
antipathy
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
conscious
of
ardent
emotions
if
not
love
for
another
woman
who
would
be
no
bad
match
even
from
the
commercial
point
of
view
yet
so
strong
was
the
effect
upon
him
of
contemplating
a
large
fortune
that
in
despite
of
reason
and
desire
he
lived
in
eager
expectation
of
the
word
which
should
make
him
rich
and
for
several
hours
after
his
disappointment
he
could
not
overcome
the
impression
of
calamity
a
part
of
that
impression
was
due
to
the
engagement
which
he
must
now
fulfil
he
had
pledged
his
word
to
ask
marian
to
marry
him
without
further
delay
to
shuffle
out
of
this
duty
would
make
him
too
ignoble
even
in
his
own
eyes
its
discharge
meant
as
he
had
expressed
it
that
he
was
doomed
he
would
deliberately
be
committing
the
very
error
always
so
flagrant
to
him
in
the
case
of
other
men
who
had
crippled
themselves
by
early
marriage
with
a
penniless
woman
but
events
had
enmeshed
him
circumstances
had
proved
fatal
because
in
his
salad
days
he
dallied
with
a
girl
who
had
indeed
many
charms
step
by
step
he
had
come
to
the
necessity
of
sacrificing
his
prospects
to
that
raw
attachment
and
to
make
it
more
irritating
this
happened
just
when
the
way
began
to
be
much
clearer
before
him
unable
to
think
of
work
he
left
the
house
and
wandered
gloomily
about
regent
s
park
for
the
first
time
in
his
recollection
the
confidence
which
was
wont
to
inspirit
him
gave
way
to
an
attack
of
sullen
discontent
he
felt
himself
by
destiny
and
therefore
by
marian
who
was
fate
s
instrument
it
was
not
in
his
nature
that
this
mood
should
last
long
but
it
revealed
to
him
those
darker
possibilities
which
his
egoism
would
develop
if
it
came
seriously
into
conflict
with
overmastering
misfortune
a
hope
a
craven
hope
insinuated
itself
into
the
cracks
of
his
infirm
resolve
he
would
not
examine
it
but
conscious
of
its
existence
he
was
able
to
go
home
in
somewhat
better
spirits
he
wrote
to
marian
if
possible
she
was
to
meet
him
at
nine
next
morning
at
gloucester
gate
he
had
reasons
for
wishing
this
interview
to
take
place
on
neutral
ground
early
in
the
afternoon
when
he
was
trying
to
do
some
work
there
arrived
a
letter
which
he
opened
with
impatient
hand
the
writing
was
mrs
reardon
s
and
he
could
not
guess
what
she
had
to
communicate
dear
mr
milvain
i
am
distressed
beyond
measure
to
read
in
this
morning
s
newspaper
that
poor
mr
biffen
has
put
an
end
to
his
life
doubtless
you
can
obtain
more
details
than
are
given
in
this
bare
report
of
the
discovery
of
his
body
will
you
let
me
hear
or
come
and
see
me
he
read
and
was
astonished
absorbed
in
his
own
affairs
he
had
not
opened
the
newspaper
it
lay
folded
on
a
chair
hastily
he
ran
his
eye
over
the
columns
and
found
at
length
a
short
paragraph
which
stated
that
the
body
of
a
man
who
had
evidently
committed
suicide
by
taking
poison
had
been
found
on
putney
heath
that
papers
in
his
pockets
identified
him
as
one
harold
biffen
lately
resident
in
goodge
street
tottenham
court
road
and
that
an
inquest
would
be
held
he
went
to
dora
s
room
and
told
her
of
the
event
but
without
mentioning
the
letter
which
had
brought
it
under
his
notice
i
suppose
there
was
no
alternative
between
that
and
starvation
i
scarcely
thought
of
biffen
as
likely
to
kill
himself
if
reardon
had
done
it
i
shouldn
t
have
felt
the
least
mr
whelpdale
will
be
bringing
us
information
no
doubt
said
dora
who
as
she
spoke
thought
more
of
that
gentleman
s
visit
than
of
the
event
that
was
to
occasion
it
really
one
can
t
grieve
there
seemed
no
possibility
of
his
ever
earning
enough
to
live
decently
upon
but
why
the
deuce
did
he
go
all
the
way
out
there
consideration
for
the
people
in
whose
house
he
lived
i
dare
say
biffen
had
a
good
deal
of
native
dora
felt
a
secret
wish
that
someone
else
possessed
more
of
that
desirable
quality
leaving
her
jasper
made
a
rapid
though
careful
toilet
and
was
presently
on
his
way
to
westbourne
park
it
was
his
hope
that
he
should
reach
mrs
yule
s
house
before
any
ordinary
afternoon
caller
could
arrive
and
so
he
did
he
had
not
been
here
since
that
evening
when
he
encountered
reardon
on
the
road
and
heard
his
reproaches
to
his
great
satisfaction
amy
was
alone
in
the
he
held
her
hand
a
trifle
longer
than
was
necessary
and
returned
more
earnestly
the
look
of
interest
with
which
she
regarded
him
i
was
ignorant
of
this
affair
when
your
letter
came
he
began
and
i
set
out
immediately
to
see
i
hoped
you
would
bring
me
some
news
what
can
have
driven
the
poor
man
to
such
extremity
poverty
i
can
only
suppose
but
i
will
see
whelpdale
i
hadn
t
come
across
biffen
for
a
long
was
he
still
so
very
poor
asked
amy
compassionately
i
m
afraid
so
his
book
failed
oh
if
i
had
imagined
him
still
in
such
distress
surely
i
might
have
done
something
to
help
him
so
often
the
regretful
remark
of
one
s
friends
when
one
has
been
permitted
to
perish
with
amy
s
sorrow
was
mingled
a
suggestion
of
tenderness
which
came
of
her
knowledge
that
the
dead
man
had
worshipped
her
perchance
his
death
was
in
part
attributable
to
that
hopeless
love
he
sent
me
a
copy
of
his
novel
she
said
and
i
saw
him
once
or
twice
after
that
but
he
was
much
better
dressed
than
in
former
days
and
i
thought
having
this
subject
to
converse
upon
put
the
two
more
quickly
at
ease
than
could
otherwise
have
been
the
case
jasper
was
closely
observant
of
the
young
widow
her
finished
graces
made
a
strong
appeal
to
his
admiration
and
even
in
some
degree
awed
him
he
saw
that
her
beauty
had
matured
and
it
was
more
distinctly
than
ever
of
the
type
to
which
he
paid
reverence
amy
might
take
a
foremost
place
among
brilliant
women
at
a
in
grand
toilet
she
would
be
superb
at
polite
receptions
people
would
whisper
who
is
that
biffen
fell
out
of
the
dialogue
it
grieved
me
very
much
said
amy
to
hear
of
the
misfortune
that
befell
my
the
legacy
affair
why
yes
it
was
a
pity
especially
now
that
her
father
is
threatened
with
is
it
so
serious
i
heard
indirectly
that
he
had
something
the
matter
with
his
eyes
but
i
didn
t
know
they
may
be
able
to
operate
before
long
and
perhaps
it
will
be
successful
but
in
the
meantime
marian
has
to
do
his
this
explains
the
the
delay
fell
from
amy
s
lips
as
she
smiled
jasper
moved
uncomfortably
it
was
a
voluntary
gesture
the
whole
situation
explains
it
he
replied
with
some
show
of
impulsiveness
i
am
very
much
afraid
marian
is
tied
during
her
father
s
indeed
but
there
is
her
no
companion
for
her
father
as
i
think
you
know
even
if
mr
yule
recovers
his
sight
it
is
not
at
all
likely
that
he
will
be
able
to
work
as
before
our
difficulties
are
so
grave
that
he
paused
and
let
his
hand
fail
despondently
i
hope
it
isn
t
affecting
your
work
your
progress
to
some
extent
necessarily
i
have
a
good
deal
of
will
you
remember
and
what
i
have
set
my
mind
upon
no
doubt
i
shall
some
day
achieve
but
one
makes
there
was
silence
the
last
three
years
he
continued
have
made
no
slight
difference
in
my
position
recall
where
i
stood
when
you
first
knew
me
i
have
done
something
since
then
i
think
and
by
my
own
steady
indeed
you
just
now
i
am
in
need
of
a
little
encouragement
you
don
t
notice
any
falling
off
in
my
work
recently
no
do
you
see
my
things
in
the
current
and
so
on
generally
i
don
t
think
i
miss
many
of
your
articles
sometimes
i
believe
i
have
detected
you
when
there
was
no
and
dora
has
been
doing
well
her
story
in
that
girls
paper
has
attracted
attention
it
s
a
great
deal
to
have
my
mind
at
rest
about
both
the
girls
but
i
can
t
pretend
to
be
in
very
good
he
rose
well
i
must
try
to
find
out
something
more
about
poor
oh
you
are
not
going
yet
mr
milvain
not
assuredly
because
i
wish
to
but
i
have
work
to
he
stepped
aside
but
came
back
as
if
on
an
impulse
may
i
ask
you
for
your
advice
in
a
very
delicate
matter
amy
was
a
little
disturbed
but
she
collected
herself
and
smiled
in
a
way
that
reminded
jasper
of
his
walk
with
her
along
gower
street
let
me
hear
what
it
he
sat
down
again
and
bent
forward
if
marian
insists
that
it
is
her
duty
to
remain
with
her
father
am
i
justified
or
not
in
freely
consenting
to
that
i
scarcely
understand
has
marian
expressed
a
wish
to
devote
herself
in
that
way
not
distinctly
but
i
suspect
that
her
conscience
points
to
it
i
am
in
serious
doubt
on
the
one
hand
he
explained
in
a
tone
of
candour
who
will
not
blame
me
if
our
engagement
terminates
in
circumstances
such
as
these
on
the
other
you
are
aware
that
her
father
objects
in
the
strongest
way
to
this
marriage
no
i
didn
t
know
he
will
neither
see
me
nor
hear
of
me
merely
because
of
my
connection
with
fadge
think
of
that
poor
girl
thus
situated
and
i
could
so
easily
put
her
at
rest
by
renouncing
all
claim
upon
i
surmise
that
that
you
yourself
would
also
be
put
at
rest
by
such
a
decision
don
t
look
at
me
with
that
ironical
smile
he
pleaded
what
you
have
said
is
true
and
really
why
should
i
not
be
glad
of
it
i
couldn
t
go
about
declaring
that
i
was
heartbroken
in
any
event
i
must
be
content
for
people
to
judge
me
according
to
their
disposition
and
judgments
are
pretty
sure
to
be
unfavourable
what
can
i
do
in
either
case
i
must
to
a
certain
extent
be
in
the
wrong
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
wrong
from
the
there
was
a
slight
movement
about
amy
s
lips
as
these
words
were
uttered
she
kept
her
eyes
down
and
waited
before
replying
the
case
is
too
delicate
i
fear
for
my
yes
i
feel
it
and
perhaps
i
oughtn
t
to
have
spoken
of
it
at
all
well
i
ll
go
back
to
my
scribbling
i
am
so
very
glad
to
have
seen
you
it
was
good
of
you
to
take
the
trouble
to
come
whilst
you
have
so
much
on
your
again
jasper
held
the
white
soft
hand
for
a
superfluous
moment
the
next
morning
it
was
he
who
had
to
wait
at
the
rendezvous
he
was
pacing
the
pathway
at
least
ten
minutes
before
the
appointed
time
when
marian
joined
him
she
was
panting
from
a
hurried
walk
and
this
affected
jasper
disagreeably
he
thought
of
amy
reardon
s
air
of
repose
and
how
impossible
it
would
be
for
that
refined
person
to
fall
into
such
disorder
he
observed
too
with
more
disgust
than
usual
the
signs
in
marian
s
attire
of
encroaching
poverty
her
unsatisfactory
gloves
her
mantle
out
of
fashion
yet
for
such
feelings
he
reproached
himself
and
the
reproach
made
him
angry
they
walked
together
in
the
same
direction
as
when
they
met
here
before
marian
could
not
mistake
the
air
of
restless
trouble
on
her
companion
s
smooth
countenance
she
had
divined
that
there
was
some
grave
reason
for
this
summons
and
the
panting
with
which
she
had
approached
was
half
caused
by
the
anxious
beats
of
her
heart
jasper
s
long
silence
again
was
ominous
he
began
abruptly
you
ve
heard
that
harold
biffen
has
committed
suicide
no
she
replied
looking
shocked
poisoned
himself
you
ll
find
something
about
it
in
today
s
he
gave
her
such
details
as
he
had
obtained
then
added
there
are
two
of
my
companions
fallen
in
the
battle
i
ought
to
think
myself
a
lucky
fellow
marian
what
you
are
better
fitted
to
fight
your
way
more
of
a
brute
you
you
know
very
well
i
don
t
you
have
more
energy
and
more
well
it
remains
to
be
seen
how
i
shall
come
out
when
i
am
weighted
with
graver
cares
than
i
have
yet
she
looked
at
him
inquiringly
but
said
nothing
i
have
made
up
my
mind
about
our
affairs
he
went
on
presently
marian
if
ever
we
are
to
be
married
it
must
be
the
words
were
so
unexpected
that
they
brought
a
flush
to
her
cheeks
and
neck
now
yes
will
you
marry
me
and
let
us
take
our
chance
her
heart
throbbed
violently
you
don
t
mean
at
once
jasper
you
would
wait
until
i
know
what
father
s
fate
is
to
be
well
now
there
s
the
point
you
feel
yourself
indispensable
to
your
father
at
present
not
indispensable
but
wouldn
t
it
seem
very
unkind
i
should
be
so
afraid
of
the
effect
upon
his
health
jasper
so
much
depends
we
are
told
upon
his
general
state
of
mind
and
body
it
would
be
dreadful
if
i
were
the
cause
of
she
paused
and
looked
up
at
him
touchingly
i
understand
that
but
let
us
face
our
position
suppose
the
operation
is
successful
your
father
will
certainly
not
be
able
to
use
his
eyes
much
for
a
long
time
if
ever
and
perhaps
he
would
miss
you
as
much
then
as
now
suppose
he
does
not
regain
his
sight
could
you
then
leave
him
dear
i
can
t
feel
it
would
be
my
duty
to
renounce
you
because
my
father
had
become
blind
and
if
he
can
see
pretty
well
i
don
t
think
i
need
remain
with
has
one
thing
occurred
to
you
will
he
consent
to
receive
an
allowance
from
a
person
whose
name
is
mrs
milvain
i
can
t
be
sure
she
replied
much
troubled
and
if
he
obstinately
refuses
what
then
what
is
before
him
marian
s
head
sank
and
she
stood
still
why
have
you
changed
your
mind
so
jasper
she
inquired
at
length
because
i
have
decided
that
the
indefinitely
long
engagement
would
be
unjust
to
you
and
to
myself
such
engagements
are
always
dangerous
sometimes
they
deprave
the
character
of
the
man
or
she
listened
anxiously
and
reflected
everything
he
went
on
would
be
simple
enough
but
for
your
domestic
difficulties
as
i
have
said
there
is
the
very
serious
doubt
whether
your
father
would
accept
money
from
you
when
you
are
my
wife
then
again
shall
we
be
able
to
afford
such
an
allowance
i
thought
you
felt
sure
of
that
i
m
not
very
sure
of
anything
to
tell
the
truth
i
am
harassed
i
can
t
get
on
with
my
i
am
very
very
it
isn
t
your
fault
marian
and
well
then
there
s
only
one
thing
to
do
let
us
wait
at
all
events
till
your
father
has
undergone
the
operation
whichever
the
result
you
say
your
own
position
will
be
the
except
jasper
that
if
father
is
helpless
i
must
find
means
of
assuring
his
in
other
words
if
you
can
t
do
that
as
my
wife
you
must
remain
marian
after
a
silence
marian
regarded
him
steadily
you
see
only
the
difficulties
in
our
way
she
said
in
a
colder
voice
they
are
many
i
know
do
you
think
them
insurmountable
upon
my
word
they
almost
seem
so
jasper
exclaimed
distractedly
they
were
not
so
great
when
we
spoke
of
marriage
a
few
years
a
few
years
he
echoed
in
a
cheerless
voice
that
is
just
what
i
have
decided
is
impossible
marian
you
shall
have
the
plain
truth
i
can
trust
your
faith
but
i
can
t
trust
my
own
i
will
marry
you
now
but
years
hence
how
can
i
tell
what
may
happen
i
don
t
trust
you
say
you
will
marry
me
now
that
sounds
as
if
you
had
made
up
your
mind
to
a
i
didn
t
mean
that
to
face
difficulties
whilst
they
spoke
the
sky
had
grown
dark
with
a
heavy
cloud
and
now
spots
of
rain
began
to
fall
jasper
looked
about
him
in
annoyance
as
he
felt
the
moisture
but
marian
did
not
seem
aware
of
it
but
shall
you
face
them
willingly
i
am
not
a
man
to
repine
and
grumble
put
up
your
umbrella
what
do
i
care
for
a
drop
of
rain
she
exclaimed
with
passionate
sadness
when
all
my
life
is
at
stake
how
am
i
to
understand
you
every
word
you
speak
seems
intended
to
dishearten
me
do
you
no
longer
love
me
why
need
you
conceal
it
if
that
is
the
truth
is
that
what
you
mean
by
saying
you
distrust
yourself
if
you
do
so
there
must
be
reason
for
it
in
the
present
could
i
distrust
myself
can
i
force
myself
in
any
manner
to
believe
that
i
shall
ever
cease
to
love
you
jasper
opened
his
umbrella
we
must
see
each
other
again
marian
we
can
t
stand
and
talk
in
the
rain
confound
it
cursed
climate
where
you
can
never
be
sure
of
a
clear
sky
for
five
minutes
i
can
t
go
till
you
have
spoken
more
plainly
jasper
how
am
i
to
live
an
hour
in
such
uncertainty
as
this
do
you
love
me
or
not
do
you
wish
me
to
be
your
wife
or
are
you
sacrificing
yourself
i
do
wish
it
her
emotion
had
an
effect
upon
him
and
his
voice
trembled
but
i
can
t
answer
for
myself
no
not
for
a
year
and
how
are
we
to
marry
now
in
face
of
all
these
what
can
i
do
what
can
i
do
she
sobbed
oh
if
i
were
but
heartless
to
everyone
but
to
you
if
i
could
give
you
my
money
and
leave
my
father
and
mother
to
their
fate
perhaps
some
could
do
that
there
is
no
natural
law
that
a
child
should
surrender
everything
for
her
parents
you
know
so
much
more
of
the
world
than
i
do
can
t
you
advise
me
is
there
no
way
of
providing
for
my
father
good
god
this
is
frightful
marian
i
can
t
stand
it
live
as
you
are
doing
let
us
wait
and
at
the
cost
of
losing
you
i
will
be
faithful
to
you
and
your
voice
says
you
promise
it
out
of
he
had
made
a
pretence
of
holding
his
umbrella
over
her
but
marian
turned
away
and
walked
to
a
little
distance
and
stood
beneath
the
shelter
of
a
great
tree
her
face
averted
from
him
moving
to
follow
he
saw
that
her
frame
was
shaken
by
soundless
sobbing
when
his
footsteps
came
close
to
her
she
again
looked
at
him
i
know
now
she
said
how
foolish
it
is
when
they
talk
of
love
being
unselfish
in
what
can
there
be
more
selfishness
i
feel
as
if
i
could
hold
you
to
your
promise
at
any
cost
though
you
have
made
me
understand
that
you
regard
our
engagement
as
your
great
misfortune
i
have
felt
it
for
weeks
oh
for
months
but
i
couldn
t
say
a
word
that
would
seem
to
invite
such
misery
as
this
you
don
t
love
me
jasper
and
that
s
an
end
of
everything
i
should
be
shamed
if
i
married
whether
i
love
you
or
not
i
feel
as
if
no
sacrifice
would
be
too
great
that
would
bring
you
the
happiness
you
deserve
she
repeated
bitterly
why
do
i
deserve
it
because
i
long
for
it
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
there
s
no
such
thing
as
deserving
happiness
or
misery
come
to
us
by
is
it
in
my
power
to
make
you
happy
no
because
it
isn
t
in
your
power
to
call
dead
love
to
life
again
i
think
perhaps
you
never
loved
me
jasper
i
could
give
my
right
hand
if
you
had
said
you
loved
me
before
i
can
t
put
it
into
words
it
sounds
too
base
and
i
don
t
wish
to
imply
that
you
behaved
basely
but
if
you
had
said
you
loved
me
before
that
i
should
have
it
always
to
you
will
do
me
no
wrong
if
you
charge
me
with
baseness
he
replied
gloomily
if
i
believe
anything
i
believe
that
i
did
love
you
but
i
knew
myself
and
i
should
never
have
betrayed
what
i
felt
if
for
once
in
my
life
i
could
have
been
the
rain
pattered
on
the
leaves
and
the
grass
and
still
the
sky
darkened
this
is
wretchedness
to
both
of
us
jasper
added
let
us
part
now
marian
let
me
see
you
i
can
t
see
you
again
what
can
you
say
to
me
more
than
you
have
said
now
i
should
feel
like
a
beggar
coming
to
you
i
must
try
and
keep
some
little
if
i
am
to
live
at
then
let
me
help
you
to
think
of
me
with
indifference
remember
me
as
a
man
who
disregarded
priceless
love
such
as
yours
to
go
and
make
himself
a
proud
position
among
fools
and
knaves
indeed
that
s
what
it
comes
to
it
is
you
who
reject
me
and
rightly
one
who
is
so
much
at
the
mercy
of
a
vulgar
ambition
as
i
am
is
no
fit
husband
for
you
soon
enough
you
would
thoroughly
despise
me
and
though
i
should
know
it
was
merited
my
perverse
pride
would
revolt
against
it
many
a
time
i
have
tried
to
regard
life
practically
as
i
am
able
to
do
theoretically
but
it
always
ends
in
hypocrisy
it
is
men
of
my
kind
who
succeed
the
conscientious
and
those
who
really
have
a
high
ideal
either
perish
or
struggle
on
in
marian
had
overcome
her
excess
of
emotion
there
is
no
need
to
disparage
yourself
she
said
what
can
be
simpler
than
the
truth
you
loved
me
or
thought
you
did
and
now
you
love
me
no
longer
it
is
a
thing
that
happens
every
day
either
in
man
or
woman
and
all
that
honour
demands
is
the
courage
to
confess
the
truth
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
as
soon
as
you
knew
that
i
was
burdensome
to
you
marian
will
you
do
this
will
you
let
our
engagement
last
for
another
six
months
but
without
our
meeting
during
that
time
but
to
what
purpose
then
we
would
see
each
other
again
and
both
would
be
able
to
speak
calmly
and
we
should
both
know
with
certainty
what
course
we
ought
to
that
seems
to
me
childish
it
is
easy
for
you
to
contemplate
months
of
postponement
there
must
be
an
end
now
i
can
bear
it
no
the
rain
fell
unceasingly
and
with
it
began
to
mingle
an
autumnal
mist
jasper
delayed
a
moment
then
asked
calmly
are
you
going
to
the
museum
go
home
again
for
this
morning
marian
you
can
t
work
i
must
and
i
have
no
time
to
lose
she
gave
him
her
hand
they
looked
at
each
other
for
an
instant
then
marian
left
the
shelter
of
the
tree
opened
her
umbrella
and
walked
quickly
away
jasper
did
not
watch
her
he
had
the
face
of
a
man
who
is
suffering
a
severe
humiliation
a
few
hours
later
he
told
dora
what
had
come
to
pass
and
without
extenuation
of
his
own
conduct
his
sister
said
very
little
for
she
recognised
genuine
suffering
in
his
tones
and
aspect
but
when
it
was
over
she
sat
down
and
wrote
to
marian
i
feel
far
more
disposed
to
congratulate
you
than
to
regret
what
has
happened
now
that
there
is
no
necessity
for
silence
i
will
tell
you
something
which
will
help
you
to
see
jasper
in
his
true
light
a
few
weeks
ago
he
actually
proposed
to
a
woman
for
whom
he
does
not
pretend
to
have
the
slightest
affection
but
who
is
very
rich
and
who
seemed
likely
to
be
foolish
enough
to
marry
him
yesterday
morning
he
received
her
final
answer
a
refusal
i
am
not
sure
that
i
was
right
in
keeping
this
a
secret
from
you
but
i
might
have
done
harm
by
interfering
you
will
understand
though
surely
you
need
no
fresh
proof
how
utterly
unworthy
he
is
of
you
you
can
not
i
am
sure
you
can
not
regard
it
as
a
misfortune
that
all
is
over
between
you
dearest
marian
do
not
cease
to
think
of
me
as
your
friend
because
my
brother
has
disgraced
himself
if
you
can
t
see
me
at
least
let
us
write
to
each
other
you
are
the
only
friend
i
have
of
my
own
sex
and
i
could
not
bear
to
lose
and
much
more
of
the
same
tenor
several
days
passed
before
there
came
a
reply
it
was
written
with
undisturbed
kindness
of
feeling
but
in
few
words
for
the
present
we
can
not
see
each
other
but
i
am
very
far
from
wishing
that
our
friendship
should
come
to
an
end
i
must
only
ask
that
you
will
write
to
me
without
the
least
reference
to
these
troubles
tell
me
always
about
yourself
and
be
sure
that
you
can
not
tell
me
too
much
i
hope
you
may
soon
be
able
to
send
me
the
news
which
was
foreshadowed
in
our
last
talk
though
foreshadowed
is
a
wrong
word
to
use
of
coming
happiness
isn
t
it
that
paper
i
sent
to
mr
trenchard
is
accepted
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
your
criticism
when
it
comes
out
don
t
spare
my
style
which
needs
a
great
deal
of
chastening
i
have
been
thinking
couldn
t
you
use
your
holiday
in
sark
for
a
story
to
judge
from
your
letters
you
could
make
an
excellent
background
of
dora
sighed
and
shook
her
little
head
and
thought
of
her
brother
with
unspeakable
disdain
chapter
xxxvii
rewards
when
the
fitting
moment
arrived
alfred
yule
underwent
an
operation
for
cataract
and
it
was
believed
at
first
that
the
result
would
be
favourable
this
hope
had
but
short
duration
though
the
utmost
prudence
was
exercised
evil
symptoms
declared
themselves
and
in
a
few
months
time
all
prospect
of
restoring
his
vision
was
at
an
end
anxiety
and
then
the
fatal
assurance
undermined
his
health
with
blindness
there
fell
upon
him
the
debility
of
premature
old
age
the
position
of
the
family
was
desperate
marian
had
suffered
much
all
the
winter
from
attacks
of
nervous
disorder
and
by
no
effort
of
will
could
she
produce
enough
literary
work
to
supplement
adequately
the
income
derived
from
her
fifteen
hundred
pounds
in
the
summer
of
things
were
at
the
worst
marian
saw
no
alternative
but
to
draw
upon
her
capital
and
so
relieve
the
present
at
the
expense
of
the
future
she
had
a
mournful
warning
before
her
eyes
in
the
case
of
poor
hinks
and
his
wife
who
were
now
kept
from
the
workhouse
only
by
charity
but
at
this
juncture
the
rescuer
appeared
mr
quarmby
and
certain
of
his
friends
were
already
making
a
subscription
for
the
yules
benefit
when
one
of
their
number
mr
jedwood
the
publisher
came
forward
with
a
proposal
which
relieved
the
minds
of
all
concerned
mr
jedwood
had
a
brother
who
was
the
director
of
a
public
library
in
a
provincial
town
and
by
this
means
he
was
enabled
to
offer
marian
yule
a
place
as
assistant
in
that
institution
she
would
receive
pounds
a
year
and
thus
adding
her
own
income
would
be
able
to
put
her
parents
beyond
the
reach
of
want
the
family
at
once
removed
from
london
and
the
name
of
yule
was
no
longer
met
with
in
periodical
literature
by
an
interesting
coincidence
it
was
on
the
day
of
this
departure
that
there
appeared
a
number
of
the
west
end
in
which
the
place
of
honour
that
of
the
week
s
celebrity
was
occupied
by
clement
fadge
a
coloured
portrait
of
this
illustrious
man
challenged
the
admiration
of
all
who
had
literary
tastes
and
two
columns
of
panegyric
recorded
his
career
for
the
encouragement
of
aspiring
youth
this
article
of
course
unsigned
came
from
the
pen
of
jasper
milvain
it
was
only
by
indirect
channels
that
jasper
learnt
how
marian
and
her
parents
had
been
provided
for
dora
s
correspondence
with
her
friend
soon
languished
in
the
nature
of
things
this
could
not
but
happen
and
about
the
time
when
alfred
yule
became
totally
blind
the
girls
ceased
to
hear
anything
of
each
other
an
event
which
came
to
pass
in
the
spring
sorely
tempted
dora
to
write
but
out
of
good
feeling
she
refrained
for
it
was
then
that
she
at
length
decided
to
change
her
name
for
that
of
whelpdale
jasper
could
not
quite
reconcile
himself
to
this
condescension
in
various
discourses
he
pointed
out
to
his
sister
how
much
higher
she
might
look
if
she
would
only
have
a
little
patience
whelpdale
will
never
be
a
man
of
any
note
a
good
fellow
i
admit
but
borne
in
all
senses
let
me
impress
upon
you
my
dear
girl
that
i
have
a
future
before
me
and
that
there
is
no
reason
with
your
charm
of
person
and
mind
why
you
should
not
marry
brilliantly
whelpdale
can
give
you
a
decent
home
i
admit
but
as
regards
society
he
will
be
a
drag
upon
it
happens
jasper
that
i
have
promised
to
marry
him
replied
dora
in
a
significant
tone
well
i
regret
it
but
you
are
of
course
your
own
mistress
i
shall
make
no
unpleasantness
i
don
t
dislike
whelpdale
and
i
shall
remain
on
friendly
terms
with
that
is
very
kind
of
you
said
his
sister
suavely
whelpdale
was
frantic
with
exultation
when
the
day
of
the
wedding
had
been
settled
he
rushed
into
jasper
s
study
and
fairly
shed
tears
before
he
could
command
his
voice
there
is
no
mortal
on
the
surface
of
the
globe
so
happy
as
i
am
he
gasped
i
can
t
believe
it
why
in
the
name
of
sense
and
justice
have
i
been
suffered
to
attain
this
blessedness
think
of
the
days
when
i
all
but
starved
in
my
albany
street
garret
scarcely
better
off
than
poor
dear
old
biffen
why
should
i
have
come
to
this
and
biffen
have
poisoned
himself
in
despair
he
was
a
thousand
times
a
better
and
cleverer
fellow
than
i
and
poor
old
reardon
dead
in
misery
could
i
for
a
moment
compare
with
him
my
dear
fellow
said
jasper
calmly
compose
yourself
and
be
logical
in
the
first
place
success
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
moral
deserts
and
then
both
reardon
and
biffen
were
hopelessly
unpractical
in
such
an
admirable
social
order
as
ours
they
were
bound
to
go
to
the
dogs
let
us
be
sorry
for
them
but
let
us
recognise
causas
rerum
as
biffen
would
have
said
you
have
exercised
ingenuity
and
perseverance
you
have
your
and
when
i
think
that
i
might
have
married
fatally
on
thirteen
or
fourteen
different
occasions
i
implore
you
never
to
tell
dora
those
stories
about
me
i
should
lose
all
her
respect
do
you
remember
the
girl
from
birmingham
he
laughed
wildly
heaven
be
praised
that
she
threw
me
over
eternal
gratitude
to
all
and
sundry
of
the
girls
who
have
plunged
me
into
wretchedness
i
admit
that
you
have
run
the
gauntlet
and
that
you
have
had
marvellous
escapes
but
be
good
enough
to
leave
me
alone
for
the
present
i
must
finish
this
review
by
only
one
word
i
don
t
know
how
to
thank
dora
how
to
express
my
infinite
sense
of
her
goodness
will
you
try
to
do
so
for
me
you
can
speak
to
her
with
calmness
will
you
tell
her
what
i
have
said
to
you
oh
i
should
recommend
a
cooling
draught
of
some
kind
look
in
at
a
chemist
s
as
you
walk
the
heavens
did
not
fall
before
the
and
the
wedded
pair
betook
themselves
for
a
few
weeks
to
the
continent
they
had
been
back
again
and
established
in
their
house
at
earl
s
court
for
a
month
when
one
morning
about
twelve
o
clock
jasper
dropped
in
as
though
casually
dora
was
writing
she
had
no
thought
of
entirely
abandoning
literature
and
had
in
hand
at
present
a
very
pretty
tale
which
would
probably
appear
in
the
english
girl
her
boudoir
in
which
she
sat
could
not
well
have
been
daintier
and
more
appropriate
to
the
charming
characteristics
of
its
mistress
mrs
whelpdale
affected
no
literary
slovenliness
she
was
dressed
in
light
colours
and
looked
so
lovely
that
even
jasper
paused
on
the
threshold
with
a
smile
of
admiration
upon
my
word
he
exclaimed
i
am
proud
of
my
sisters
what
did
you
think
of
maud
last
night
wasn
t
she
superb
she
certainly
did
look
very
well
but
i
doubt
if
she
s
very
that
is
her
own
look
out
i
told
her
plainly
enough
my
opinion
of
dolomore
but
she
was
in
such
a
tremendous
you
are
detestable
jasper
is
it
inconceivable
to
you
that
a
man
or
woman
should
be
disinterested
when
they
marry
by
no
maud
didn
t
marry
for
money
any
more
than
i
you
remember
the
northern
farmer
doan
t
thou
marry
for
money
but
go
where
money
an
admirable
piece
of
advice
well
maud
made
a
mistake
let
us
say
dolomore
is
a
clown
and
now
she
knows
it
why
if
she
had
waited
she
might
have
married
one
of
the
leading
men
of
the
day
she
is
fit
to
be
a
duchess
as
far
as
appearance
goes
but
i
was
never
snobbish
i
care
very
little
about
titles
what
i
look
to
is
intellectual
combined
with
financial
why
that
is
what
distinction
he
looked
round
the
room
with
a
smile
you
are
not
uncomfortable
here
old
girl
i
wish
mother
could
have
lived
till
i
wish
it
very
very
often
dora
replied
in
a
moved
voice
we
haven
t
done
badly
drawbacks
considered
now
you
may
speak
of
money
as
scornfully
as
you
like
but
suppose
you
had
married
a
man
who
could
only
keep
you
in
lodgings
how
would
life
look
to
you
who
ever
disputed
the
value
of
money
but
there
are
things
one
mustn
t
sacrifice
to
gain
i
suppose
so
well
i
have
some
news
for
you
dora
i
am
thinking
of
following
your
dora
s
face
changed
to
grave
anticipation
and
who
is
it
amy
his
sister
turned
away
with
a
look
of
intense
annoyance
you
see
i
am
disinterested
myself
he
went
on
i
might
find
a
wife
who
had
wealth
and
social
standing
but
i
choose
amy
an
abominable
choice
no
an
excellent
choice
i
have
never
yet
met
a
woman
so
well
fitted
to
aid
me
in
my
career
she
has
a
trifling
sum
of
money
which
will
be
useful
for
the
next
year
or
two
what
has
she
done
with
the
rest
of
it
then
oh
the
ten
thousand
is
intact
but
it
can
t
be
seriously
spoken
of
it
will
keep
up
appearances
till
i
get
my
editorship
and
so
on
we
shall
be
married
early
in
august
i
think
i
want
to
ask
you
if
you
will
go
and
see
on
no
account
i
couldn
t
be
civil
to
jasper
s
brows
blackened
this
is
idiotic
prejudice
dora
i
think
i
have
some
claim
upon
you
i
have
shown
some
kindness
you
have
and
i
am
not
ungrateful
but
i
dislike
mrs
reardon
and
i
couldn
t
bring
myself
to
be
friendly
with
you
don
t
know
too
well
you
yourself
have
taught
me
to
know
her
don
t
compel
me
to
say
what
i
think
of
she
is
beautiful
and
and
i
don
t
know
a
womanly
quality
that
she
doesn
t
possess
you
will
offend
me
most
seriously
if
you
speak
a
word
against
then
i
will
be
silent
but
you
must
never
ask
me
to
meet
never
never
then
we
shall
quarrel
i
haven
t
deserved
this
dora
if
you
refuse
to
meet
my
wife
on
terms
of
decent
friendliness
there
s
no
more
intercourse
between
your
house
and
mine
you
have
to
choose
persist
in
this
fatuous
obstinacy
and
i
have
done
with
you
so
be
it
that
is
your
final
answer
dora
who
was
now
as
angry
as
he
gave
a
short
affirmative
and
jasper
at
once
left
her
but
it
was
very
unlikely
that
things
should
rest
at
this
pass
the
brother
and
sister
were
bound
by
a
strong
mutual
affection
and
whelpdale
was
not
long
in
effecting
a
compromise
my
dear
wife
he
exclaimed
in
despair
at
the
threatened
calamity
you
are
right
a
thousand
times
but
it
s
impossible
for
you
to
be
on
ill
terms
with
jasper
there
s
no
need
for
you
to
see
much
of
mrs
reardon
i
hate
her
she
killed
her
husband
i
am
sure
of
my
darling
i
mean
by
her
base
conduct
she
is
a
cold
cruel
unprincipled
creature
jasper
makes
himself
more
than
ever
contemptible
by
marrying
all
the
same
in
less
than
three
weeks
mrs
whelpdale
had
called
upon
amy
and
the
call
was
returned
the
two
women
were
perfectly
conscious
of
reciprocal
dislike
but
they
smothered
the
feeling
beneath
conventional
suavities
jasper
was
not
backward
in
making
known
his
gratitude
for
dora
s
concession
and
indeed
it
became
clear
to
all
his
intimates
that
this
marriage
would
be
by
no
means
one
of
mere
interest
the
man
was
in
love
at
last
if
he
had
never
been
before
let
lapse
the
ensuing
twelve
months
and
come
to
an
evening
at
the
end
of
july
mr
and
mrs
milvain
are
entertaining
a
small
and
select
party
of
friends
at
dinner
their
house
in
bayswater
is
neither
large
nor
internally
magnificent
but
it
will
do
very
well
for
the
temporary
sojourn
of
a
young
man
of
letters
who
has
much
greater
things
in
confident
expectation
who
is
a
good
deal
talked
of
who
can
gather
clever
and
worthy
people
at
his
table
and
whose
matchless
wife
would
attract
men
of
taste
to
a
very
much
poorer
abode
jasper
had
changed
considerably
in
appearance
since
that
last
holiday
that
he
spent
in
his
mother
s
house
at
finden
at
present
he
would
have
been
taken
for
though
only
in
his
year
his
hair
was
noticeably
thinning
his
moustache
had
grown
heavier
a
wrinkle
or
two
showed
beneath
his
eyes
his
voice
was
softer
yet
firmer
it
goes
without
saying
that
his
evening
uniform
lacked
no
point
of
perfection
and
somehow
it
suggested
a
more
elaborate
care
than
that
of
other
men
in
the
room
he
laughed
frequently
and
with
a
throwing
back
of
the
head
which
seemed
to
express
a
spirit
of
triumph
amy
looked
her
years
to
the
full
but
her
type
of
beauty
as
you
know
was
independent
of
youthfulness
that
suspicion
of
masculinity
observable
in
her
when
she
became
reardon
s
wife
impressed
one
now
only
as
the
consummate
grace
of
a
woman
you
saw
that
at
forty
at
fifty
she
would
be
one
of
the
stateliest
of
dames
when
she
bent
her
head
towards
the
person
with
whom
she
spoke
it
was
an
act
of
queenly
favour
her
words
were
uttered
with
just
enough
deliberation
to
give
them
the
value
of
an
opinion
she
smiled
with
a
delicious
shade
of
irony
her
glance
intimated
that
nothing
could
be
too
subtle
for
her
understanding
the
guests
numbered
six
and
no
one
of
them
was
insignificant
two
of
the
men
were
about
jasper
s
age
and
they
had
already
made
their
mark
in
literature
the
third
was
a
novelist
of
circulating
fame
spirally
crescent
the
three
of
the
stronger
sex
were
excellent
modern
types
with
sweet
lips
attuned
to
epigram
and
good
broad
brows
the
novelist
at
one
point
put
an
interesting
question
to
amy
is
it
true
that
fadge
is
leaving
the
current
it
is
rumoured
i
going
to
one
of
the
quarterlies
they
say
remarked
a
lady
he
is
getting
terribly
autocratic
have
you
heard
the
delightful
story
of
his
telling
mr
rowland
to
persevere
as
his
last
work
was
one
of
considerable
promise
mr
rowland
was
a
man
who
had
made
a
merited
reputation
when
fadge
was
still
on
the
lower
rungs
of
journalism
amy
smiled
and
told
another
anecdote
of
the
great
editor
whilst
speaking
she
caught
her
husband
s
eye
and
perhaps
this
was
the
reason
why
her
story
at
the
close
seemed
rather
amiably
pointless
not
a
common
fault
when
she
narrated
when
the
ladies
had
withdrawn
one
of
the
younger
men
in
a
conversation
about
a
certain
magazine
remarked
thomas
always
maintains
that
it
was
killed
by
that
solemn
old
stager
alfred
yule
by
the
way
he
is
dead
himself
i
jasper
bent
forward
alfred
yule
is
dead
so
jedwood
told
me
this
morning
he
died
in
the
country
somewhere
blind
and
fallen
on
evil
days
poor
old
all
the
guests
were
ignorant
of
any
tie
of
kindred
between
their
host
and
the
man
spoken
of
i
believe
said
the
novelist
that
he
had
a
clever
daughter
who
used
to
do
all
the
work
he
signed
that
used
to
be
a
current
bit
of
scandal
in
fadge
s
oh
there
was
much
exaggeration
in
that
remarked
jasper
blandly
his
daughter
assisted
him
doubtless
but
in
quite
a
legitimate
way
one
used
to
see
her
at
the
the
subject
was
dropped
an
hour
and
a
half
later
when
the
last
stranger
had
taken
his
leave
jasper
examined
two
or
three
letters
which
had
arrived
since
and
were
lying
on
the
hall
table
with
one
of
them
open
in
his
hand
he
suddenly
sprang
up
the
stairs
and
leaped
rather
than
stepped
into
the
amy
was
reading
an
evening
paper
look
at
this
he
cried
holding
the
letter
to
her
it
was
a
communication
from
the
publishers
who
owned
the
current
they
stated
that
the
editorship
of
that
review
would
shortly
be
resigned
by
mr
fadge
and
they
inquired
whether
milvain
would
feel
disposed
to
assume
the
vacant
chair
amy
sprang
up
and
threw
her
arms
about
her
husband
s
neck
uttering
a
cry
of
delight
so
soon
oh
this
is
great
this
is
glorious
do
you
think
this
would
have
been
offered
to
me
but
for
the
spacious
life
we
have
led
of
late
never
was
i
right
in
my
calculations
amy
did
i
ever
doubt
it
he
returned
her
embrace
ardently
and
gazed
into
her
eyes
with
profound
tenderness
doesn
t
the
future
brighten
it
has
been
very
bright
to
me
jasper
since
i
became
your
and
i
owe
my
fortune
to
you
dear
girl
now
the
way
is
smooth
they
placed
themselves
on
a
settee
jasper
with
an
arm
about
his
wife
s
waist
as
if
they
were
newly
plighted
lovers
when
they
had
talked
for
a
long
time
milvain
said
in
a
changed
tone
i
am
told
that
your
uncle
is
he
mentioned
how
the
news
had
reached
him
i
must
make
inquiries
i
suppose
there
will
be
a
notice
in
the
study
and
some
of
the
other
papers
i
hope
somebody
will
make
it
an
opportunity
to
have
a
hit
at
that
ruffian
fadge
it
doesn
t
much
matter
now
how
you
speak
of
fadge
but
i
was
a
trifle
anxious
when
i
heard
your
story
at
oh
you
can
afford
to
be
more
what
are
you
thinking
about
why
do
you
look
sad
yes
i
know
i
know
i
ll
try
to
forgive
i
can
t
help
thinking
at
times
of
the
poor
girl
amy
life
will
be
easier
for
her
now
with
only
her
mother
to
support
someone
spoke
of
her
this
evening
and
repeated
fadge
s
lie
that
she
used
to
do
all
her
father
s
she
was
capable
of
doing
it
i
must
seem
to
you
rather
a
woman
in
comparison
isn
t
it
true
my
dearest
you
are
a
perfect
woman
and
poor
marian
was
only
a
clever
do
you
know
i
never
could
help
imagining
that
she
had
on
her
fingers
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
say
it
unkindly
it
was
touching
to
me
at
the
time
for
i
knew
how
fearfully
hard
she
she
nearly
ruined
your
life
remember
jasper
was
silent
you
will
never
confess
it
and
that
is
a
fault
in
she
loved
me
perhaps
as
a
loves
but
you
never
loved
amy
examined
his
face
as
he
spoke
her
image
is
very
faint
before
me
jasper
pursued
and
soon
i
shall
scarcely
be
able
to
recall
it
yes
you
are
right
she
nearly
ruined
me
and
in
more
senses
than
one
poverty
and
struggle
under
such
circumstances
would
have
made
me
a
detestable
creature
as
it
is
i
am
not
such
a
bad
fellow
she
laughed
and
caressed
his
cheek
no
i
am
far
from
a
bad
fellow
i
feel
kindly
to
everyone
who
deserves
it
i
like
to
be
generous
in
word
and
deed
trust
me
there
s
many
a
man
who
would
like
to
be
generous
but
is
made
despicably
mean
by
necessity
what
a
true
sentence
that
is
of
landor
s
it
has
been
repeated
often
enough
that
vice
leads
to
misery
will
no
man
declare
that
misery
leads
to
vice
i
have
much
of
the
weakness
that
might
become
viciousness
but
i
am
now
far
from
the
possibility
of
being
vicious
of
course
there
are
men
like
fadge
who
seem
only
to
grow
meaner
the
more
prosperous
they
are
but
these
are
exceptions
happiness
is
the
nurse
of
and
independence
the
root
of
true
the
glorious
privilege
of
being
independent
yes
burns
understood
the
matter
go
to
the
piano
dear
and
play
me
something
if
i
don
t
mind
i
shall
fall
into
whelpdale
s
vein
and
talk
about
my
blessedness
ha
isn
t
the
world
a
glorious
place
for
rich
yes
for
rich
people
how
i
pity
the
poor
devils
play
anything
better
still
if
you
will
sing
my
nightingale
so
amy
first
played
and
then
sang
and
jasper
lay
back
in
dreamy
bliss
