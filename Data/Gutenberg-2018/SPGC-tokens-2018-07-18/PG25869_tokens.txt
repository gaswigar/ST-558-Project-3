chapter
i
welcome
home
i
do
think
waiting
for
a
steamer
is
the
horridest
pokiest
performance
in
the
world
you
never
know
when
they
coming
no
matter
how
much
they
sight
them
and
signal
them
and
wireless
them
allen
was
not
pettish
and
she
spoke
half
laughingly
but
she
was
wearied
with
her
long
wait
for
the
in
which
she
expected
her
daughter
nan
and
incidentally
fairfield
and
patty
there
there
my
dear
said
her
husband
soothingly
i
think
it
will
soon
arrive
now
i
think
so
too
declared
kenneth
harper
who
was
looking
down
the
river
through
i
just
sure
i
see
that
whale
of
a
boat
in
the
dim
distance
and
i
think
i
see
patty
yellow
head
sticking
over
the
bow
do
you
cried
allen
eagerly
do
you
see
nan
i
not
positive
that
i
do
but
we
soon
shall
know
for
that
surely
the
it
surely
was
and
though
the
last
quarter
hour
of
waiting
seemed
longer
than
all
the
rest
at
last
the
big
ship
was
in
front
of
them
and
swinging
around
in
midstream
they
could
see
the
fairfields
clearly
now
but
not
being
within
hearing
distance
they
could
only
express
their
welcome
by
frantic
wavings
of
hands
handkerchiefs
and
flags
but
at
last
the
gangplank
was
put
in
place
and
at
last
the
fairfields
crossed
it
and
then
an
enthusiastic
and
somewhat
incoherent
scene
of
reunion
followed
beside
and
allen
and
kenneth
harper
roger
and
elise
farrington
were
there
to
meet
the
and
the
young
people
seized
on
patty
as
if
they
would
never
let
her
go
again
my
but
you
grown
said
kenneth
looking
at
her
admiringly
i
mean
you
looking
older
you
know
i
only
a
year
older
returned
patty
laughing
and
you
that
yourself
why
so
i
am
but
you
changed
somehow
i
do
know
just
how
honest
kenneth
looked
so
puzzled
that
elise
laughed
at
him
and
said
nonsense
ken
it
her
clothes
she
has
a
foreign
effect
but
it
will
soon
wear
off
in
new
york
i
glad
to
see
you
again
patty
we
think
it
would
be
so
long
when
we
parted
in
paris
last
spring
no
indeed
and
i
glad
to
be
home
again
though
i
have
had
a
terribly
good
time
now
i
suppose
we
must
see
about
our
luggage
yes
said
roger
you
be
sorry
you
brought
so
many
fine
clothes
when
you
have
to
pay
duty
on
them
well
duty
first
and
pleasure
afterward
said
kenneth
come
on
patty
i
help
you
oh
dear
said
allen
must
we
wait
for
all
this
botheration
i
so
tired
of
waiting
no
you
need
said
fairfield
kindly
you
and
nan
and
allen
jump
in
a
taxicab
and
go
home
i
keep
patty
with
me
and
any
other
of
the
young
people
who
care
to
stay
and
we
settle
matters
here
in
short
order
the
young
people
all
cared
to
stay
and
though
they
had
to
wait
some
time
when
at
last
they
did
get
a
customs
inspector
he
proved
to
be
both
courteous
and
expeditious
oh
do
spoil
my
best
hat
cried
patty
in
dismay
as
he
laid
thoughtless
hands
on
a
befeathered
creation
that
i
wo
was
the
hearty
response
and
the
hat
was
laid
back
in
its
box
as
carefully
as
an
infant
in
its
cradle
i
have
ladies
in
my
own
family
and
i
know
just
how
you
feel
about
it
i
perfectly
willing
to
declare
all
my
dutiable
goods
went
on
patty
but
i
do
hate
to
have
my
nice
things
all
tumbled
up
quite
right
quite
right
amiably
agreed
the
inspector
who
had
fallen
a
victim
to
patty
pretty
face
and
bright
smiles
well
you
did
get
through
easily
patty
said
elise
after
it
was
over
and
the
trunks
despatched
by
express
when
we
came
home
mother
was
half
a
day
fussing
over
customs
it
patty
winning
ways
as
does
it
said
kenneth
she
hypnotised
that
fat
inspector
with
a
mere
glance
of
her
eye
nonsense
said
patty
laughing
it
an
easy
trick
they
always
nice
and
kind
if
you
jolly
them
a
little
bit
jolly
me
said
kenneth
and
see
how
nice
and
kind
i
be
you
kind
enough
as
you
are
returned
patty
if
you
were
any
kinder
i
be
overwhelmed
with
obligations
but
how
are
we
all
going
to
get
into
this
taxicab
five
into
one
wo
go
that
easy
said
roger
i
perch
outside
with
the
chauffeur
no
let
me
said
kenneth
but
after
a
controversy
roger
won
the
day
and
climbed
into
the
front
seat
fairfield
kenneth
and
the
two
girls
settled
themselves
inside
and
off
they
started
for
the
fairfields
home
in
street
i
do
see
much
change
in
the
old
town
remarked
patty
as
they
neared
the
flatiron
you
do
eh
observed
kenneth
well
there
the
metropolitan
tower
i
guess
you
say
that
pretty
fine
if
you
have
seen
the
campanile
in
venice
but
i
did
returned
patty
i
was
too
late
for
the
old
one
and
too
soon
for
the
new
but
is
this
a
campanile
father
what
a
campanile
pure
and
simple
a
campanile
ought
always
to
be
pure
and
simple
of
line
said
fairfield
but
if
you
mean
what
is
it
specifically
it
a
bell
tower
listen
you
hear
the
now
oh
what
lovely
chimes
cried
patty
let
move
father
and
take
a
house
beneath
the
shadow
of
a
great
clock
i
moved
enough
for
a
while
my
child
if
i
once
get
seated
at
my
own
fireside
i
shall
stay
there
how
christmassy
things
look
went
on
patty
gazing
out
of
the
cab
window
it
only
the
middle
of
december
but
the
streets
are
crowded
and
there
are
holly
wreaths
in
some
of
the
windows
you
wo
have
to
buy
many
christmas
presents
will
you
patty
said
elise
i
suppose
you
brought
home
enough
italian
trinkets
to
supply
all
your
friends
yes
we
did
laughed
patty
i
daresay
my
friends
will
get
tired
of
busts
of
dante
and
models
of
the
forum
do
give
those
to
me
if
you
have
a
roman
scarf
nobody
else
wants
i
thank
you
kindly
all
right
elise
i
remember
that
and
if
i
have
i
daresay
i
can
buy
one
in
the
new
york
shops
wicked
girl
do
attempt
any
such
deception
on
your
tried
and
true
friend
oh
patty
do
you
remember
the
day
we
got
lost
in
paris
and
then
the
two
girls
plunged
into
a
flood
of
reminiscences
that
lasted
all
the
way
home
come
in
of
course
we
come
in
said
roger
as
he
assisted
them
from
the
cab
and
patty
graciously
invited
him
that
what
we
here
for
we
all
coming
in
and
if
we
heartily
urged
we
may
stay
to
dinner
in
reality
allen
who
was
temporarily
hostess
in
her
house
had
invited
kenneth
and
the
two
farringtons
to
dine
in
order
to
make
a
gay
for
patty
very
cosy
and
attractive
the
house
looked
as
after
more
than
a
absence
patty
once
again
stepped
inside
it
had
been
closed
while
and
fairfield
were
away
but
a
few
days
before
their
return
allen
nan
mother
had
come
over
from
philadelphia
and
opened
the
house
and
made
it
cheery
and
livable
a
bright
fire
glowed
in
the
library
flowers
were
all
about
and
hung
in
the
windows
it
good
to
be
home
again
said
patty
as
she
sank
into
an
and
threw
aside
her
furs
it
good
to
have
you
here
responded
elise
i
missed
you
terribly
me
too
said
roger
while
kenneth
added
so
say
we
all
of
us
always
a
favourite
wherever
she
went
patty
was
specially
beloved
by
her
young
friends
in
new
york
and
so
the
reunion
was
a
happy
one
to
all
concerned
before
dinner
was
announced
patty
flew
up
to
her
own
room
to
change
her
travelling
costume
for
a
pretty
little
come
on
elise
she
said
and
soon
the
two
girls
were
cosily
chatting
in
patty
you
look
so
different
with
your
hair
done
up
said
elise
were
you
sorry
to
give
up

hate
to
feel

way

only

patty
i
do
know
nan

planned

she
waited
to
see
her
mother
first
but
i

allen

invite
us
to
philadelphia
to
spend
christmas
with
her
you
do

you

oh
i

to
elise

all
the
girls
they
all
well
and
crazy
to
see

hilda

making
you
the
loveliest
christmas
present
you

but
of
course
i
promised

it
no
do
tell
me
i
rather
be
surprised
come
on
i
ready
let
go
down
and
talk
to
the
boys
patty
had
done
up
her
pretty
hair
in
the
prevailing
fashion
of
the
day
but
though
the
soft
braids
encircled
her
head
many
little
golden
curls
escaped
and
made
a
soft
outline
round
her
face
her
frock
of
pale
rose
colour
had
a
collarless
lace
yoke
and
was
very
becoming
you
can
wear
any
colour
patty
declared
elise
of
course
blue
is
yours
by
right
but
you
dear
in
that
pinky
thing
ah
sweet
chub
i
hoped
i
should
be
dear
to
thee
in
any
old
thing
remarked
patty
as
slipping
her
arm
through
that
of
elise
the
two
girls
went
downstairs
ha
patty
resplendent
exclaimed
roger
as
they
entered
the
library
do
you
dare
to
be
a
young
lady
patty
fairfield
or
i
shall
cut
your
acquaintance
not
i
do
be
alarmed
roger
i
am
still
childlike
and
bland
your
cousin
ethelyn
is
going
to
make
her
d√©but
next
week
i
have
a
bid
to
the
ceremonies
yes
so
have
i
well
let
her
out
if
she
likes
i
prefer
to
in
for
another
year
anyway
so
do
i
said
elise
mother
says
i
ought
to
come
out
next
winter
but
i
not
bothering
about
it
yet
let
have
a
good
time
this
winter
then
said
kenneth
while
all
children
if
you
girls
come
out
next
winter
you
be
so
gay
with
dances
and
parties
i
ca
play
with
you
at
all
all
right
agreed
patty
but
have
you
time
to
play
yourself
ken
i
thought
you
were
fearfully
busy
absorbing
the
laws
of
the
united
states
oh
i
do
have
to
hammer
at
that
all
day
and
some
evenings
too
but
it
an
unwritten
law
that
a
fellow
must
have
some
fun
so
i
take
an
afternoon
off
now
and
then
to
come
round
and
tease
you
girls
then
dinner
was
announced
and
following
their
elders
the
young
people
went
out
to
the
oh
how
pretty
cried
patty
as
she
saw
the
table
for
the
decoration
though
simple
was
most
effective
along
the
centre
of
the
white
cloth
lay
a
long
bed
of
holly
leaves
on
which
the
word
welcome
was
outlined
in
holly
berries
there
were
no
other
flowers
and
the
glossy
green
and
vivid
scarlet
made
a
charming
centrepiece
surrounded
as
it
was
by
dainty
silver
glass
and
china
it
good
to
be
here
once
more
said
nan
as
she
took
her
place
at
the
head
of
her
own
table
right
you
are
said
fairfield
as
he
sat
opposite
her
mother
allen
it
was
kind
of
you
to
arrange
this
hearty
welcome
home
for
us
it
does
half
express
my
joy
at
having
you
here
again
said
allen
as
she
looked
affectionately
at
her
daughter
then
the
conversation
turned
upon
christmas
and
christmas
plans
i
must
have
nan
with
me
at
christmas
said
allen
and
i
shall
count
on
fred
also
of
course
patty
dear
i
want
you
too
if
you
care
to
come
but
oh
allen
broke
in
elise
divide
the
family
with
me
wo
you
if
you
have
and
fairfield
wo
you
let
me
take
patty
as
elise
had
hinted
this
to
allen
while
they
were
at
the
steamer
dock
waiting
for
patty
the
good
lady
was
not
greatly
surprised
and
she
knew
that
patty
would
prefer
to
be
in
new
york
with
her
young
friends
rather
than
in
philadelphia
so
it
was
settled
that
patty
should
spend
christmas
with
elise
much
to
the
joy
of
both
girls
and
also
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
two
boys
we
have
a
gay
old
time
said
roger
we
have
a
tree
and
a
dance
and
a
boar
head
whatever
that
thing
is
i
never
did
know
i
do
know
either
confessed
patty
but
we
find
out
for
we
must
have
all
the
modern
improvements
i
should
call
a
boar
head
a
modern
improvement
said
fairfield
smiling
but
ours
will
be
said
saucy
patty
for
it
will
be
such
an
improvement
on
the
sort
they
used
to
have
and
we
have
carols
and
waits
what
are
waits
said
elise
why
waits
said
patty
do
you
know
what
waits
are
why
just
oh
yes
said
elise
i
understand
you
explain
things
so
clearly
patty
yes
does
she
agreed
kenneth
never
mind
elise
i
be
a
wait
and
show
you
do
said
elise
i
much
rather
see
than
be
one
just
think
patty
christmas
is
only
ten
days
off
can
you
be
ready
oh
yes
said
patty
smiling
why
i
could
get
ready
for
two
christmases
in
ten
days
wonderful
girl
commented
roger
i
thought
ladies
were
always
behind
time
with
their
christmas
preparations
i
thought
they
always
said
does
seem
christmas
is
so
near
and
things
like
that
i
have
half
my
presents
ready
said
kenneth
in
an
exaggerated
feminine
voice
i
have
finished
that
pink
pincushion
for
sadie
nor
the
blue
bedroom
slippers
for
bella
roger
took
the
cue
nor
i
he
said
also
mimicking
a
fussy
womanish
manner
but
i
never
get
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
until
near
christmas
day
then
i
run
round
and
try
to
do
everything
at
once
do
you
tie
up
your
presents
in
tissue
paper
and
asked
kenneth
turning
to
roger
as
if
in
earnest
oh
yes
and
i
stick
on
those
foolish
little
seals
and
holly
tags
anything
to
make
it
fussy
and
fluttery
gracious
said
patty
that
reminds
me
i
suppose
i
must
get
that
holly
ribbon
and
tissue
paper
flummery
i
forgot
all
about
it
what
do
they
use
this
year
elise
white
tissue
paper
no
red
it
so
nice
and
cheery
yes
said
roger
most
christmas
presents
need
a
cheery
paper
it
counteracts
the
depressing
effect
of
an
unwelcome
gift
do
pay
any
attention
to
him
said
elise
he
putting
on
airs
he
thinks
it
funny
to
talk
like
that
but
you
just
ought
to
see
him
on
christmas
he
simply
adores
his
presents
and
fairly
gloats
over
every
one
sure
i
do
said
roger
heartily
but
when
you
get
a
purple
necktie
or
a
it
nice
to
have
a
cheery
red
paper
round
it
well
i
have
a
lovely
present
for
you
said
patty
but
i
shall
take
the
precaution
of
wrapping
it
in
red
paper
chapter
ii
an
advance
christmas
gift
the
ten
days
before
christmas
flew
by
like
bandersnatches
patty
had
a
long
list
of
friends
to
whom
she
wanted
to
give
presents
and
though
she
had
brought
home
a
lot
of
what
kenneth
called
foreign
junk
she
had
no
notion
of
giving
it
all
away
of
course
the
lovely
fans
beads
and
scarves
she
brought
made
lovely
gifts
for
the
girls
and
the
little
curios
and
souvenirs
were
all
right
for
the
boys
but
there
were
so
many
friends
and
her
relatives
beside
that
she
soon
realised
she
would
have
little
left
for
herself
and
though
unselfish
she
did
want
to
retain
some
mementos
of
her
foreign
trip
so
shopping
was
necessary
and
nearly
every
day
she
went
with
nan
or
elise
to
buy
the
christmas
wares
that
the
city
shops
displayed
and
i
do
think
she
said
that
things
are
just
as
pretty
and
just
as
cheap
here
as
over
there
some
things
agreed
nan
yes
i
mean
just
the
regular
wares
of
course
for
roman
silks
and
florentine
mosaics
it
better
to
shop
where
they
grow
what
father
going
to
give
me
nan
inquisitive
creature
i
should
tell
you
if
i
knew
but
as
i
know
and
he
does
either
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
he
be
glad
of
a
hint
what
would
you
like
honestly
i
do
know
of
a
thing
is
it
awful
to
have
everything
you
want
you
a
contented
little
girl
patty
and
that
a
noble
trait
i
admit
but
just
at
christmas
time
it
trying
now
if
you
only
wanted
a
watch
or
a
diamond
ring
or
some
trifle
like
that
i
be
glad
to
give
your
father
a
hint
thank
you
stepmamma
said
patty
smiling
but
i
have
a
watch
and
too
young
for
diamonds
i
ca
help
it
if
i
amply
supplied
with
this
world
goods
and
think
of
the
lots
of
gifts
i
get
anyway
perhaps
father
better
just
give
me
the
money
and
let
me
put
it
in
the
bank
against
a
rainy
day
why
patty
you
not
getting
mercenary
i
hope
what
do
you
want
of
money
in
the
bank
patty
looked
earnest
no
i
do
think
i
mercenary
she
said
slowly
but
nan
you
never
know
what
may
happen
suppose
father
should
lose
all
his
money
nonsense
he
ca
do
that
it
most
carefully
invested
and
you
know
patty
he
thinks
of
retiring
from
business
in
a
year
or
two
more
i
know
it
said
patty
with
a
little
sigh
i
know
we
rich
not
wealthy
like
the
farringtons
but
plenty
rich
enough
only
you
often
hear
of
rich
men
losing
their
money
and
sometimes
i
think
i
ought
to
save
up
some
goosie
said
nan
smiling
fondly
at
her
do
bother
your
curly
head
about
such
things
before
it
necessary
all
right
then
i
wo
said
patty
shaking
the
curly
head
and
smiling
back
that
afternoon
she
went
to
see
clementine
morse
clementine
had
called
one
day
when
patty
was
not
at
home
so
this
was
the
first
time
the
girls
had
met
since
patty
return
the
maid
asked
patty
to
go
right
up
to
clementine
own
room
and
there
patty
found
her
friend
surrounded
by
what
looked
like
a
whirlwind
of
rags
on
tables
chairs
and
even
on
the
floor
were
scraps
and
bits
of
silks
satins
ribbons
and
laces
and
in
a
low
chair
sat
clementine
sewing
rapidly
as
if
for
dear
life
but
at
sight
of
patty
she
jumped
up
upsetting
her
and
flew
to
greet
her
guest
you
dear
thing
she
cried
as
she
embraced
her
i
was
so
sorry
not
to
see
you
when
i
called
i
should
have
come
again
but
i
so
rushed
with
christmas
work
that
i
ca
go
anywhere
until
christmas
is
over
do
take
off
your
things
and
sit
down
and
do
mind
if
i
go
on
sewing
will
you
i
can
talk
just
as
well
you
know
apparently
you
can
said
patty
laughing
for
as
she
chatted
clementine
had
already
resumed
her
work
and
her
fingers
flew
nimbly
along
the
satin
seams
what
you
doing
dressing
dolls
said
clementine
as
she
threaded
her
needle
and
still
to
do
but
their
underclothing
is
done
so
it
only
a
matter
of
frocks
and
some
hats
did
you
have
a
good
time
in
europe
clementine
talked
very
fast
apparently
to
keep
time
with
her
flying
fingers
and
as
patty
picked
up
a
lot
of
dry
goods
in
order
that
she
might
occupy
the
chair
they
were
in
her
hostess
rattled
on
how
did
you
like
venice
was
it
lovely
by
moonlight
oh
would
you
put
this
scarlet
velvet
on
the
spangled
lace
or
save
it
for
this
white
chiffon
clementine
do
keep
still
a
minute
cried
patty
you
drive
me
frantic
what
you
doing
with
all
these
dolls
dressing
them
how
did
you
like
paris
was
it
very
gay
and
was
london
smoky
foggy
i
mean
yes
everything
was
gay
or
smoky
or
lovely
by
moonlight
or
just
what
it
ought
to
be
now
tell
me
you
dress
four
hundred
million
dolls
all
at
once
oh
they
for
the
sunshine
babies
was
naples
very
dirty
how
did
you
like
clementine
you
leave
the
map
of
europe
alone
i
talking
now
what
are
sunshine
babies
why
the
babies
that
the
sunshine
society
gives
a
christmas
to
and
there
oceans
of
babies
and
they
all
want
dolls
i
guess
the
boys
must
like
dolls
too
they
want
so
many
and
oh
patty
they
the
dearest
little
things
the
babies
i
mean
and
i
just
to
dress
dolls
for
them
i
rather
do
it
than
to
make
presents
for
my
rich
friends
suddenly
patty
felt
a
great
wave
of
she
had
planned
and
prepared
gifts
for
all
her
friends
and
for
most
of
her
relatives
but
for
the
poor
she
had
done
nothing
to
charity
she
had
given
no
thought
and
at
christmas
when
all
the
world
should
feel
the
spirit
of
good
will
to
men
she
had
utterly
neglected
to
remember
those
less
fortunate
than
herself
what
the
matter
said
clementine
dismayed
by
patty
expression
of
remorse
i
a
pig
said
patty
there
no
other
word
for
such
a
horrid
thing
as
i
am
why
clementine
i
made
presents
for
nearly
everybody
i
know
and
i
have
done
a
thing
for
charity
did
you
ever
know
such
an
ungrateful
wretch
oh
it
is
too
late
yet
said
clementine
not
quite
understanding
why
patty
was
so
serious
about
it
here
help
me
sew
these
she
tossed
her
some
tiny
satin
sleeves
already
cut
and
basted
and
offered
a
furnished
i
will
said
patty
and
in
a
few
moments
she
too
was
sewing
as
deftly
if
not
quite
so
rapidly
as
clementine
you
see
clem
she
went
on
i
been
so
busy
ever
since
i
came
home
that
i
simply
forgot
the
poor
people
and
now
it
too
late
it
too
late
to
make
things
agreed
clementine
but
not
too
late
to
buy
them
but
i
spent
all
my
christmas
money
said
patty
contritely
father
gives
me
a
liberal
allowance
and
then
extra
for
christmas
money
and
it
just
about
all
gone
and
i
hate
to
ask
him
for
more
well
never
mind
patsy
you
can
make
up
for
it
next
year
and
if
you
help
me
dress
these
dolls
that
will
square
up
your
conscience
no
it
wo
but
i
find
a
way
to
do
something
somehow
are
these
sunshine
people
all
babies
oh
no
the
society
helps
all
sorts
of
poor
people
children
and
too
mother
is
one
of
the
directors
and
we
do
a
lot
of
this
every
year
well
i
help
you
a
while
this
afternoon
but
i
wo
have
another
chance
you
see
just
about
every
moment
is
taken
up
from
now
till
christmas
you
going
to
the
farringtons
are
you
yes
for
three
or
four
days
while
nan
and
father
are
in
philadelphia
at
nan
mother
you
coming
to
the
christmas
eve
dance
of
course
yes
indeed
it
to
be
a
lovely
party
the
farringtons
always
have
such
beautiful
entertainments
now
patty
do
tell
me
about
your
trip
so
patty
told
many
tales
of
her
stay
in
paris
and
in
england
and
of
her
pleasure
trip
through
italy
and
as
she
talked
her
fingers
flew
and
she
had
soon
completed
three
doll
dresses
that
were
quite
as
pretty
and
as
clementine
now
i
must
go
she
said
at
last
i
glad
to
have
been
of
a
little
help
and
next
year
i
help
you
a
lot
though
i
suppose
your
sunshine
babies
have
dolls
when
it
is
christmas
oh
yes
these
are
for
their
tree
you
know
well
clem
if
i
should
have
some
money
left
me
unexpectedly
is
it
too
late
to
buy
some
toys
for
the
tree
i
do
know
said
clementine
but
we
can
ask
mother
she
know
they
found
morse
in
her
tying
up
parcels
and
addressing
them
patty
soon
discovered
that
these
were
all
charitable
gifts
and
not
presents
to
morse
own
friends
i
so
glad
i
came
here
she
said
after
the
welcoming
greetings
were
over
for
it
has
roused
my
charitable
instincts
i
am
quite
sure
morse
i
can
send
some
toys
for
your
society
tree
if
you
want
them
want
them
indeed
we
do
why
patty
there
are
forty
little
boys
who
want
drums
or
trumpets
and
we
can
only
give
them
candy
and
an
orange
it
harder
than
you
think
to
get
subscriptions
to
our
funds
at
christmas
time
and
though
we
dolls
enough
we
do
so
want
toys
for
the
boys
well
i
send
you
some
morse
i
send
them
do
you
care
what
they
are
no
indeed
drums
or
balls
or
tin
carts
anything
that
a
can
play
with
well
you
may
depend
on
me
for
the
forty
said
patty
smiling
for
she
had
formed
a
sudden
secret
resolve
why
patty
dear
how
kind
of
you
i
am
so
glad
for
those
children
were
on
my
mind
and
i
already
asked
every
one
i
know
to
give
to
our
fund
you
are
a
generous
little
girl
and
i
know
it
will
gladden
your
own
heart
as
well
as
the
children
patty
ran
away
and
all
the
way
home
her
heart
was
full
of
her
project
if
he
will
only
consent
she
thought
if
not
i
do
know
how
i
shall
keep
my
promise
oh
well
i
know
i
can
coax
him
to
say
yes
after
dinner
that
evening
patty
put
her
plan
into
action
father
fairfield
she
said
what
are
you
going
to
give
me
for
a
christmas
gift
well
pattykins
that
not
considered
a
correct
question
in
polite
society
then
let
be
impolite
just
for
this
once
do
tell
me
daddy
you
embarrass
me
exceedingly
young
lady
said
fairfield
smiling
at
her
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
bought
you
anything
oh
i
so
glad
exclaimed
patty
for
father
i
want
to
ask
you
a
great
favour
wo
you
give
me
the
money
instead
and
let
me
spend
it
as
i
like
that
would
be
a
funny
christmas
gift
i
thought
you
liked
some
pretty
trinket
tied
up
in
holly
paper
and
red
ribbons
and
santa
claus
seals
and
served
to
you
on
a
silver
salver
well
i
do
from
other
people
but
from
you
i
just
want
the
money
that
my
present
would
cost
and
i
want
it
now
bless
my
soul
she
wants
it
now
why
patsy
what
are
you
going
to
do
buy
stock
no
but
i
do
want
it
father
wo
you
give
it
to
me
and
i
tell
you
afterward
what
i
going
to
do
with
it
i
tell
you
now
said
nan
smiling
at
the
pair
she
going
to
put
it
in
the
bank
because
she
afraid
she
be
poor
some
day
i
do
wonder
you
think
that
stepmothery
said
patty
her
eyes
twinkling
at
nan
for
i
did
tell
you
so
but
since
then
i
changed
my
mind
and
though
i
want
my
present
from
father
in
cash
i
going
to
spend
it
before
christmas
and
not
put
it
in
the
bank
at
all
well
you
are
a
weathercock
patty
but
before
morning
you
will
have
changed
your
mind
again
no
indeedy
it
made
up
to
stay
this
time
so
give
me
the
money
like
a
duck
of
a
daddy
wo
you
patty
was
very
wheedlesome
as
she
caressed
her
father
cheek
and
smiled
into
his
eyes
well
as
you
do
often
make
a
serious
request
and
as
you
seem
to
be
in
dead
earnest
this
time
i
rather
think
i
shall
have
to
say
yes
oh
you
dear
good
lovely
father
cried
patty
embracing
him
will
you
give
it
to
me
now
and
how
much
will
it
be
patty
said
nan
laughing
you
positively
sordid
i
never
saw
you
so
greedy
for
money
before
patty
laughed
outright
now
that
she
had
gained
her
point
she
felt
in
gay
spirits
friends
she
said
you
see
before
you
a
pauper
a
penniless
pauper
therefore
and
because
of
which
and
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
i
am
in
immediate
need
of
money
i
stoop
to
this
means
of
obtaining
it
and
as
aforesaid
i
like
it
now
she
held
out
her
rosy
palm
to
her
father
and
stood
waiting
expectantly
only
one
hand
exclaimed
fairfield
in
surprise
i
thought
such
a
grasping
young
woman
would
expect
both
hands
filled
all
right
said
patty
and
she
promptly
extended
her
other
palm
too
putting
both
his
hands
in
his
pockets
fairfield
drew
them
out
again
and
then
laid
a
goldpiece
on
each
of
patty
outstretched
palms
oh
you
dear
daddy
she
cried
as
she
clasped
the
gold
in
her
fingers
you
lovely
parent
this
is
the
nicest
christmas
gift
i
ever
had
and
now
i
tell
you
all
about
it
so
she
told
them
quite
seriously
how
she
had
really
forgotten
to
give
the
poor
and
the
suffering
any
share
of
her
own
christmas
cheer
and
how
this
was
the
only
way
she
could
think
of
to
remedy
her
neglect
and
it
so
lovely
she
concluded
for
there
are
forty
little
and
with
this
money
i
can
get
them
each
a
present
so
you
can
said
nan
i
go
with
you
to
select
them
and
if
we
can
get
some
cheaper
than
fifty
cents
and
i
think
we
can
have
a
little
left
for
extras
that
so
agreed
patty
they
often
have
lovely
toys
for
about
cents
and
i
could
get
some
marbles
or
something
to
fill
up
to
fill
up
what
asked
her
father
oh
to
fill
up
the
tree
or
i
get
some
ornaments
or
some
tinsel
to
decorate
it
oh
father
you
are
so
good
to
me
this
is
a
lovely
christmas
present
chapter
iii
the
day
before
christmas
fairfield
gift
to
his
wife
was
a
beautiful
and
as
they
were
going
away
for
the
holiday
he
presented
it
to
her
the
day
before
christmas
it
was
practically
a
gift
to
patty
as
well
for
the
whole
family
could
enjoy
it
it
perfectly
lovely
said
nan
as
they
all
started
out
for
a
little
spin
to
try
it
i
had
so
much
trouble
of
late
with
taxicabs
that
it
a
genuine
comfort
to
have
my
own
car
at
my
beck
and
call
it
a
lovely
car
fred
and
patty
and
i
shall
just
about
live
in
it
i
want
you
to
enjoy
it
returned
fairfield
and
you
may
have
every
confidence
in
the
chauffeur
he
most
highly
recommended
by
a
man
i
know
well
and
he
both
careful
and
skilful
a
man
too
observed
patty
i
like
his
looks
and
his
mode
of
address
but
if
this
car
is
partly
my
present
then
i
ought
not
to
have
had
that
gold
money
to
buy
drums
with
oh
yes
you
ought
said
her
father
that
was
your
individual
gift
in
this
car
you
and
nan
are
partners
by
the
way
puss
did
you
ever
get
your
forty
drums
i
did
hear
about
them
you
lucky
that
you
did
hear
them
laughed
patty
yes
i
did
get
them
not
all
drums
some
other
toys
and
i
took
them
down
to
the
sunshine
place
yesterday
i
went
with
morse
and
clementine
you
know
the
kiddywids
had
their
christmas
tree
the
little
poor
children
and
such
a
noise
you
never
heard
they
yelled
and
shouted
for
glee
and
they
banged
drums
and
tooted
horns
and
then
they
sang
songs
and
i
think
i
never
knew
such
a
noisy
celebration
even
on
the
fourth
of
july
and
were
they
glad
to
get
your
gifts
oh
yes
indeed
why
just
think
father
the
little
girls
all
had
dolls
but
if
i
had
taken
the
gifts
for
the
boys
they
would
only
have
had
candy
or
an
orange
next
christmas
i
going
to
do
more
for
them
i
glad
to
see
your
charitable
spirit
waking
up
i
want
you
to
be
a
mere
social
butterfly
but
you
know
you
need
wait
for
christmas
to
make
the
poor
babies
happy
no
i
know
it
daddy
dear
and
after
christmas
is
over
i
going
to
try
to
do
some
good
in
the
world
now
patty
said
nan
do
you
go
in
for
settlement
work
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
wo
let
you
you
not
strong
enough
for
it
i
do
know
exactly
what
settlement
work
is
said
patty
but
i
do
know
i
not
going
to
be
a
mere
butterfly
i
going
to
accomplish
something
worth
while
well
wait
till
the
holiday
season
is
over
advised
fairfield
you
made
forty
boys
happy
now
turn
your
attention
to
making
your
family
and
friends
happy
what
are
you
going
to
give
your
poor
old
father
for
a
christmas
gift
i
should
like
to
know
i
have
any
such
relative
as
you
describe
returned
patty
smiling
at
him
affectionately
i
have
a
young
and
handsome
father
and
i
think
he
seems
to
be
rather
a
rich
gentleman
also
i
have
a
gift
awaiting
him
at
home
and
i
think
we
better
be
going
there
i
do
too
said
nan
we
none
too
much
time
to
get
our
luncheon
and
go
to
the
train
oh
what
a
comfort
it
will
be
to
go
to
the
train
in
our
own
yes
said
patty
and
then
miller
can
come
back
and
take
me
over
to
elise
so
home
they
went
and
had
their
own
little
christmas
celebration
before
they
went
their
separate
ways
this
is
a
christmas
feast
said
patty
as
they
sat
at
their
own
luncheon
table
she
had
placed
a
sprig
of
holly
at
each
plate
and
a
vase
of
poinsettia
blossoms
graced
the
centre
of
the
table
this
soup
is
in
place
of
the
boar
head
she
went
on
gaily
and
i
know
we
are
going
to
have
chicken
croquettes
which
we
will
pretend
are
the
roast
turkey
and
then
we
have
our
presents
as
i
know
you
two
will
fly
for
your
train
as
soon
as
you
leave
the
table
so
patty
gave
nan
her
present
which
was
a
lovely
white
couch
pillow
of
lace
and
embroidery
and
nan
gave
patty
a
picture
to
hang
in
her
own
room
it
was
a
beautiful
a
venetian
scene
and
patty
was
delighted
with
it
then
patty
gave
her
father
a
gold
penholder
which
she
had
had
made
expressly
for
him
and
engraved
with
his
name
why
that
fine
pattykins
he
exclaimed
i
can
only
write
poems
with
a
pen
like
that
it
not
made
for
business
letters
i
sure
of
course
it
is
said
patty
gaily
it
to
keep
on
your
desk
in
the
library
here
at
home
and
you
must
use
it
just
for
social
correspondence
or
or
to
sign
checks
for
us
suggested
nan
smiling
that
just
what
i
do
with
it
declared
fairfield
it
a
gem
of
a
pen
patty
you
know
my
weakness
for
fine
desk
appointments
you
nan
gave
her
husband
a
watch
fob
on
which
hung
a
locket
containing
a
miniature
of
her
own
sweet
face
neither
patty
nor
her
father
had
seen
this
before
as
nan
had
been
careful
to
keep
the
matter
secret
in
order
to
surprise
them
it
was
a
real
work
of
art
and
so
winsome
was
the
pictured
face
that
patty
cried
out
in
admiration
what
a
stunner
you
are
nan
i
realise
you
were
so
but
it
exactly
like
you
that
a
compliment
patty
laughed
nan
but
i
surmise
that
you
mean
well
i
do
so
i
think
it
a
lovely
picture
of
a
lovely
lady
there
that
much
better
said
nan
as
patty
caught
her
round
the
shoulders
and
kissed
her
affectionately
give
me
the
lady
said
fairfield
taking
nan
into
his
own
arms
as
the
portrait
is
a
gift
to
me
i
will
kiss
her
for
it
myself
do
said
patty
but
if
you
give
her
more
than
three
kisses
lose
your
train
it
getting
pretty
late
is
it
cried
fairfield
then
jane
bring
in
those
two
boxes
i
left
in
your
charge
will
you
yes
sir
cried
the
waitress
and
leaving
the
room
she
returned
in
a
moment
with
two
large
white
boxes
these
are
christmas
gifts
to
the
two
loveliest
ladies
i
know
said
fairfield
gallantly
tendering
a
box
to
each
but
i
had
my
christmas
gift
from
you
exclaimed
patty
and
so
have
i
cried
nan
nevertheless
these
are
laid
at
your
feet
said
fairfield
calmly
depositing
the
boxes
on
the
floor
in
front
of
them
oh
well
we
may
as
well
see
what
they
are
said
patty
untying
the
white
ribbons
that
fastened
her
box
nan
did
likewise
and
in
a
moment
they
were
both
rapturously
exclaiming
over
two
sets
of
white
furs
that
nestled
in
billows
of
white
tissue
paper
nan
furs
were
ermine
and
patty
were
soft
fluffy
white
fox
and
so
beautiful
were
they
that
the
two
recipients
donned
them
at
once
and
posed
side
by
side
before
the
mirror
admiring
themselves
and
each
other
then
with
a
simultaneous
impulse
they
turned
to
thank
the
donor
and
fairfield
found
himself
suddenly
entangled
in
four
arms
and
two
boas
while
two
immense
muffs
met
at
the
back
of
his
neck
and
enveloped
his
head
and
ears
have
mercy
he
cried
come
one
at
a
time
ca
you
yes
yes
glad
you
pleased
but
do
get
this
fur
out
of
my
mouth
i
feel
as
if
i
were
attacked
by
polar
bears
oh
fathery
fairfield
patty
cried
you
are
the
dearest
thing
in
the
world
how
you
know
i
wanted
furs
and
white
fox
of
all
things
and
ermine
for
nan
oh
but
you
a
good
gentleman
is
he
stepmother
he
do
said
nan
smiling
roguishly
at
her
husband
who
somehow
seemed
satisfied
with
this
faint
praise
now
scamper
he
cried
if
you
would
see
your
mother
you
must
leave
here
in
less
than
an
hour
can
you
be
ready
i
ca
but
i
will
replied
nan
gaily
as
she
ran
away
to
prepare
for
her
journey
patty
too
went
to
her
room
to
get
ready
for
her
visit
at
the
farringtons
she
was
to
stay
three
days
and
as
there
were
several
parties
planned
for
her
entertainment
she
packed
a
small
trunk
with
several
of
her
prettiest
gowns
also
she
had
a
suitcase
full
of
gifts
for
the
christmas
tree
which
was
to
be
part
of
the
festivities
she
bade
her
parents
when
they
started
and
watched
the
new
disappear
round
the
corner
then
returned
to
her
own
preparations
i
do
have
lovely
things
she
thought
to
herself
as
she
folded
her
dainty
garments
and
laid
them
in
their
places
then
she
glanced
again
at
her
new
furs
i
have
too
much
she
thought
it
is
fair
for
one
girl
to
have
so
much
when
so
many
poor
people
have
nothing
i
wonder
what
i
ought
to
do
about
it
poor
patty
was
confronting
the
problem
that
has
troubled
and
baffled
so
many
honest
hearts
but
the
more
she
thought
about
it
the
more
it
seemed
insoluble
at
any
rate
it
would
be
absurd
to
give
my
white
furs
or
my
chiffon
frocks
to
poor
people
she
concluded
for
they
could
use
them
well
after
the
holidays
i
going
to
see
what
i
can
do
but
now
i
must
hurry
or
i
be
late
an
hour
or
two
later
she
found
herself
in
the
farringtons
home
what
lovely
furs
patty
exclaimed
farrington
and
how
well
they
suit
you
they
were
extremely
becoming
and
patty
pretty
face
with
its
soft
colour
and
smiling
eyes
rose
like
a
flower
from
the
white
fur
at
her
throat
yes
are
they
beautiful
patty
responded
father
just
gave
them
to
me
and
i
so
pleased
with
them
and
well
you
may
be
now
you
girls
run
away
and
play
for
i
a
thousand
things
to
do
indeed
farrington
was
in
a
whirlpool
of
presents
that
she
was
both
sending
and
receiving
maids
and
footmen
were
running
hither
and
thither
bringing
messages
or
carrying
out
orders
and
as
the
whole
house
was
full
of
warmth
and
light
and
the
spicy
fragrance
of
christmas
greens
patty
fairly
revelled
in
the
pleasant
atmosphere
she
was
of
a
nature
very
susceptible
to
surroundings
like
a
cat
she
loved
to
bask
in
warm
sunshine
or
in
a
luxurious
place
moreover
she
was
fond
of
elise
and
so
looked
forward
to
her
three
days
visit
with
glad
anticipation
after
patty
had
laid
aside
her
things
the
two
girls
sat
down
to
chat
in
the
big
hall
on
the
second
floor
of
the
mansion
a
was
blazing
and
soft
lights
cast
a
delightful
glow
elise
said
patty
somewhat
suddenly
do
you
think
we
have
too
much
riches
and
things
elise
stared
at
her
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
patty
laughed
at
her
friend
blank
expression
but
she
went
on
i
mean
just
what
i
say
of
course
you
have
lots
more
riches
and
things
than
i
have
but
i
think
we
all
have
too
much
when
we
think
of
the
poor
people
who
have
any
oh
you
mean
socialism
exclaimed
elise
suddenly
enlightened
no
i
do
mean
socialism
i
mean
plain
charity
do
you
think
we
ought
to
give
away
more
why
yes
if
you
like
said
elise
who
was
greatly
puzzled
do
you
want
me
to
subscribe
to
some
charity
i
will
well
perhaps
i
hold
you
to
that
said
patty
slowly
for
after
the
holidays
i
going
to
try
to
do
something
in
the
matter
i
do
know
just
what
i
have
thought
it
out
yet
but
i
not
going
to
be
what
my
father
calls
a
social
butterfly
and
i
do
believe
you
want
to
either
no
i
do
but
do
leave
it
all
till
after
the
holidays
patty
for
now
i
want
you
to
help
me
with
some
christmas
presents
elise
looked
so
worried
and
so
beseeching
that
patty
laughed
then
she
kissed
her
and
said
all
right
lisa
mine
command
me
my
services
are
at
your
disposal
so
the
girls
went
up
to
the
sun
parlour
where
elise
had
all
her
choicest
belongings
and
where
she
now
had
her
array
of
christmas
gifts
the
room
was
entirely
of
glass
and
by
a
careful
arrangement
of
double
panes
and
concealed
was
made
comfortable
even
in
the
coldest
weather
flowers
and
plants
were
round
the
sides
birds
in
gilt
cages
sang
and
twittered
and
gilt
wicker
furniture
gave
the
place
a
dainty
french
effect
that
was
charming
on
the
tables
were
strewn
christmas
gifts
of
all
sorts
i
just
tying
up
the
last
ones
said
elise
do
be
afraid
to
look
yours
is
safely
hidden
away
now
here
what
i
want
to
know
she
picked
up
a
gold
seal
ring
which
however
had
no
crest
or
monogram
cut
on
it
and
a
bronze
paper
cutter
they
lovely
said
patty
as
she
looked
at
them
who
catches
these
that
just
what
i
do
know
i
bought
the
ring
for
roger
and
the
paper
cutter
for
kenneth
harper
he
coming
but
i
like
to
change
them
about
and
give
the
ring
to
ken
and
the
paper
knife
to
roger
would
you
no
i
would
said
patty
bluntly
why
do
you
want
to
do
such
a
thing
the
ring
is
much
the
handsomer
gift
said
elise
who
had
turned
a
trifle
pink
of
course
it
is
said
patty
and
that
why
you
should
give
it
to
your
brother
it
too
personal
a
gift
to
give
to
a
boy
friend
that
what
i
was
afraid
of
said
elise
with
a
little
sigh
but
roger
wo
care
for
it
at
all
and
kenneth
would
like
it
heaps
you
gave
it
to
him
asked
patty
quickly
oh
i
do
know
yes
perhaps
so
nonsense
elise
you
too
young
to
give
rings
to
young
men
ken
is
a
young
man
he
only
a
boy
well
he
over
and
anyway
i
know
it
would
be
right
for
you
to
give
him
a
ring
your
mother
would
like
it
at
all
oh
she
would
care
well
she
ought
to
and
i
think
she
would
now
do
be
silly
give
the
ring
to
roger
and
if
you
want
something
grander
than
this
bronze
jig
for
ken
get
him
a
book
as
handsome
a
book
as
you
choose
but
a
book
or
something
that
impersonal
not
a
ring
or
a
or
anything
like
that
but
he
gave
you
a
necklace
the
day
we
sailed
for
paris
it
was
only
a
locket
with
the
merest
thread
of
a
gold
chain
and
anyway
i
never
wore
it
but
once
or
twice
well
you
ought
to
have
accepted
it
if
a
personal
gift
is
so
reprehensible
elise
you
a
goose
said
patty
losing
her
patience
at
last
a
gift
like
that
is
not
in
very
good
taste
from
a
boy
to
a
girl
but
from
a
girl
to
a
boy
it
very
much
worse
and
anyway
it
was
different
in
my
case
for
ken
and
i
are
old
friends
which
you
and
he
are
not
and
beside
father
knew
about
it
and
he
said
as
a
parting
keepsake
it
was
all
right
but
at
a
christmas
tree
in
your
own
house
elise
you
make
a
great
mistake
if
you
give
kenneth
harper
a
seal
ring
all
right
patty
you
know
i
always
do
just
as
you
say
so
i
give
it
to
roger
patty
knew
she
had
judged
rightly
in
the
matter
but
she
also
knew
that
elise
was
greatly
disappointed
at
her
decision
she
had
already
noticed
that
elise
liked
handsome
kenneth
but
if
she
did
that
was
only
an
added
reason
why
she
should
not
make
him
a
present
of
a
ring
she
ought
to
have
had
more
sense
patty
said
to
herself
indignantly
and
i
sorry
if
she
sorry
but
i
could
let
her
do
such
a
foolish
thing
chapter
iv
a
splendid
tree
the
christmas
eve
dinner
was
set
for
an
early
hour
that
the
younger
farrington
children
might
take
part
in
the
festivities
beside
elise
and
roger
there
were
two
younger
girls
louise
and
hester
and
bobby
aged
ten
when
patty
went
down
to
the
she
found
these
three
eager
with
anticipation
of
the
christmas
frolic
about
to
begin
kenneth
harper
was
there
too
but
there
were
no
other
guests
as
this
evening
was
to
be
a
family
celebration
soon
the
other
members
of
the
household
appeared
and
then
dinner
was
announced
and
they
all
went
to
the
farrington
offered
his
arm
to
patty
and
escorted
her
out
first
as
guest
of
honour
farrington
followed
with
kenneth
and
then
the
five
farrington
children
came
out
less
formally
a
burst
of
applause
greeted
their
first
sight
of
the
dinner
table
it
was
indeed
a
christmas
feast
to
the
eye
as
well
as
to
the
palate
in
the
centre
of
the
table
was
a
christmas
tree
decorated
with
tinsel
and
gay
ornaments
and
lighted
by
tiny
electric
bulbs
at
each
plate
also
was
a
tiny
christmas
tree
whose
standards
bore
the
names
of
the
diners
here
mine
cried
bobby
as
he
slid
into
his
chair
oh
what
a
jolly
dinner
on
the
little
place
trees
hung
nuts
and
bonbons
which
were
to
be
eaten
at
the
pleasure
of
the
performer
as
roger
expressed
it
the
table
was
also
decked
with
holly
and
red
ribbons
and
the
various
viands
as
they
were
served
were
shaped
or
decorated
in
keeping
with
the
occasion
the
farrington
household
was
conducted
on
a
most
elaborate
plan
and
their
dinners
were
usually
very
formal
and
conventional
but
was
an
exception
and
save
for
the
solemn
butler
and
grave
footmen
everybody
in
the
room
was
bubbling
over
with
laughter
and
merriment
i
not
hungry
any
more
declared
bobby
after
he
had
done
full
justice
to
several
courses
let
hurry
up
and
have
the
tree
wait
bobs
advised
hester
we
have
had
the
ice
cream
yet
oh
that
so
said
bobby
ca
we
have
it
now
mother
and
skip
these
flummerydiddles
he
looked
scornfully
at
the
dainty
salad
that
had
just
been
placed
before
him
but
farrington
only
smiled
not
caring
to
remind
him
of
the
laws
of
table
etiquette
on
a
festive
occasion
have
patience
bobby
dear
she
said
the
ice
cream
will
come
next
and
too
you
know
the
longer
the
dinner
the
later
you
can
sit
up
that
so
agreed
bobby
my
but
christmas
eve
is
fun
wish
i
could
sit
up
late
every
night
but
it
would
be
christmas
eve
every
night
said
patty
smiling
at
the
boy
that
so
neither
no
more
it
would
well
i
wish
it
was
christmas
eve
every
night
then
that
right
laughed
patty
make
a
good
big
wish
while
you
about
it
then
the
ice
cream
was
served
and
of
course
it
was
in
shapes
of
christmas
trees
and
santa
clauses
and
sprigs
of
holly
and
christmas
bells
and
patty
portion
was
a
lovely
spray
of
mistletoe
bough
ho
ho
laughed
kenneth
seeing
it
across
the
table
another
good
chance
lost
you
know
the
penalty
patty
if
you
caught
under
the
mistletoe
but
of
course
if
you
eat
mistletoe
the
charm
fails
i
willing
it
should
said
patty
as
she
took
up
her
spoon
i
not
pining
for
a
rustic
swain
to
kiss
me
the
mistletoe
bough
patty
looked
very
roguish
and
provoking
as
she
said
this
and
farrington
said
gallantly
ah
no
perhaps
not
but
the
swains
are
doing
the
pining
without
doubt
now
roger
sat
on
the
other
side
of
patty
and
as
his
father
finished
speaking
he
said
apparently
apropos
of
nothing
mother
are
these
your
spode
plates
or
are
they
cauldon
ware
they
spode
roger
why
do
you
want
to
know
are
you
suddenly
becoming
interested
in
china
yes
he
replied
are
you
sure
mother
these
are
spode
he
lifted
the
handsome
plate
in
front
of
him
and
gazed
intently
at
the
mark
on
its
under
side
as
he
held
it
just
above
the
level
of
his
eyes
be
careful
roger
you
spill
your
ice
cream
admonished
his
father
no
i
wo
sir
he
said
as
he
replaced
his
plate
but
i
never
saw
spode
with
this
decoration
before
let
me
look
at
yours
patty
he
took
up
patty
plate
of
ice
cream
and
lifting
it
quite
high
studied
the
stamp
on
that
suddenly
he
moved
it
until
the
dish
of
mistletoe
ice
cream
was
directly
over
patty
head
fairly
caught
he
cried
under
the
mistletoe
and
before
patty
caught
the
jest
roger
had
kissed
her
pretty
pink
cheek
and
then
calmly
restored
her
plate
of
ice
cream
to
its
place
in
front
of
her
you
villain
she
cried
glaring
at
him
and
pretending
to
be
greatly
offended
but
smiling
in
spite
of
herself
at
his
clever
ruse
good
for
you
my
boy
cried
farrington
clapping
his
hands
i
wish
i
had
thought
of
that
myself
but
it
a
game
that
wo
work
twice
indeed
it
wo
said
patty
i
take
care
of
that
and
she
began
to
eat
her
mistletoe
ice
cream
in
proof
of
her
words
it
never
can
happen
again
said
kenneth
in
sad
tones
as
he
watched
the
mistletoe
disappear
but
i
not
give
up
all
hope
it
still
christmas
eve
and
there
are
other
mistletoes
and
other
manners
and
other
girls
said
patty
glancing
mischievously
at
elise
yes
there
are
four
of
us
said
louise
so
innocently
that
they
all
laughed
all
right
louise
said
kenneth
you
find
a
nice
big
spray
of
mistletoe
after
dinner
and
wear
it
in
that
big
topknot
bow
of
yours
and
i
promise
to
kiss
you
on
both
cheeks
but
louise
was
too
shy
to
respond
to
this
repartee
and
she
dropped
her
eyes
in
confusion
now
said
farrington
as
she
rose
from
the
table
we
have
our
christmas
waits
sing
carols
and
then
we
have
our
tree
the
children
understood
this
and
hester
and
bobby
at
once
ran
out
of
the
room
a
few
moments
later
they
returned
dressed
in
trailing
white
robes
like
surplices
and
before
they
reached
the
their
childish
voices
could
be
heard
singing
carols
they
had
been
well
trained
and
sang
very
prettily
and
as
they
appeared
in
the
doorway
patty
could
scarcely
believe
that
these
demure
little
figures
were
the
two
merry
children
after
two
or
three
carols
by
the
waits
the
whole
party
joined
in
a
christmas
chorus
and
patty
clear
soprano
rang
out
sweetly
in
the
harmony
what
a
lovely
voice
you
have
patty
dear
said
farrington
as
the
song
was
done
it
has
improved
greatly
since
i
heard
you
last
are
you
taking
lessons
i
shall
farrington
after
we
get
fairly
settled
father
wants
me
to
begin
as
soon
as
he
can
find
the
right
teacher
yes
indeed
you
must
do
so
it
would
be
a
shame
not
to
cultivate
such
a
talent
as
that
you
improved
patty
declared
kenneth
my
but
your
voice
is
stunning
i
expect
we
see
you
on
the
concert
stage
yet
more
likely
on
a
fifth
avenue
stage
said
patty
laughing
now
for
the
tree
exclaimed
bobby
who
had
thrown
aside
his
white
robe
and
was
ready
for
the
fun
to
begin
the
tree
had
been
set
up
in
the
indoor
which
was
in
the
casino
this
casino
practically
another
house
opened
from
the
great
hall
of
the
farrington
mansion
and
its
various
apartments
were
devoted
to
different
sorts
of
amusements
the
tennis
court
made
a
fine
setting
for
the
christmas
celebration
and
had
been
carefully
prepared
for
the
great
event
the
floor
was
covered
with
white
canton
flannel
so
arranged
over
slight
ridges
and
hummocks
that
it
looked
exactly
like
a
field
of
drifted
snow
the
tree
at
the
end
of
the
room
was
the
largest
that
could
be
obtained
and
was
loaded
with
beautiful
ornaments
and
decorations
and
glittering
with
electric
lights
of
all
colours
patty
had
seen
many
christmas
trees
but
never
such
a
large
or
splendid
one
and
it
almost
took
her
breath
away
i
did
know
trees
ever
grew
so
big
she
said
how
you
get
it
into
the
house
it
difficult
said
farrington
i
had
to
engineer
the
job
myself
but
bobby
asked
for
a
big
tree
and
as
the
children
are
growing
up
so
fast
i
wanted
to
humour
him
as
patty
had
often
said
for
a
millionaire
farrington
was
the
kindest
man
she
ever
knew
though
wealthy
he
had
no
desire
for
display
or
ostentatious
extravagance
but
he
loved
to
please
his
children
and
was
sufficiently
rewarded
by
their
enjoyment
of
the
pleasures
he
provided
now
he
was
as
frankly
delighted
with
bobby
enthusiasm
as
bobby
was
with
his
tree
come
on
old
chappie
he
cried
you
shall
be
santa
claus
and
distribute
the
gifts
meantime
the
older
ones
were
admiring
the
decorations
of
the
room
round
the
walls
were
smaller
evergreen
trees
of
varying
heights
giving
the
effect
of
a
clearing
in
a
grove
of
evergreens
the
ceiling
had
been
draped
across
with
dark
blue
material
and
was
studded
with
stars
made
of
tiny
electric
lights
bunches
and
wreaths
of
holly
tied
with
red
ribbons
gave
a
touch
of
colour
to
the
general
effect
and
in
one
corner
beneath
a
green
arched
bower
a
chime
of
bells
pealed
softly
at
intervals
altogether
the
whole
place
breathed
the
very
spirit
of
christmas
and
so
perfect
were
the
appointments
that
no
false
note
marred
the
harmony
of
it
all
now
for
the
presents
cried
bobby
oh
daddy
there
my
railroad
wo
you
other
people
wait
till
i
see
how
it
works
the
others
all
laughed
at
the
eager
apologetic
little
face
as
bobby
found
it
impossible
to
curb
his
impatience
to
see
his
new
toy
it
was
indeed
a
fine
electric
railway
and
every
one
became
interested
as
farrington
began
to
take
it
from
its
box
and
put
the
parts
together
this
is
the
way
it
goes
dad
said
roger
kneeling
on
the
floor
beside
his
father
no
this
way
said
kenneth
as
he
adjusted
some
of
the
parts
quite
content
to
wait
for
their
gifts
farrington
and
the
girls
stood
round
watching
the
proceedings
with
interest
and
soon
patty
and
elise
were
down
on
the
floor
too
breathlessly
waiting
the
completion
of
the
structure
and
cheering
gaily
as
the
first
train
went
successfully
round
the
long
track
other
trains
followed
switches
were
set
signals
opened
or
closed
bridges
crossed
and
all
the
manoeuvres
of
a
real
railroad
repeated
in
miniature
i
have
had
so
much
fun
since
i
was
a
kid
said
kenneth
rising
from
the
floor
and
mopping
his
heated
brow
with
his
handkerchief
nor
i
declared
farrington
i
rather
rig
up
that
toy
for
that
boy
of
mine
than
than
to
own
a
real
railroad
i
believe
you
would
said
his
wife
laughing
and
now
suppose
you
see
what
santa
claus
has
for
the
rest
of
us
father
all
in
said
roger
you
sit
on
that
heap
of
snow
dad
and
kenneth
and
i
will
unload
these
groaning
branches
bobby
was
too
absorbed
in
his
cars
to
think
of
anything
else
so
the
little
girls
acted
as
messengers
to
distribute
the
gifts
from
the
tree
and
this
performance
was
a
lengthy
one
parcel
after
parcel
daintily
wrapped
and
tied
was
given
to
patty
and
of
course
the
farringtons
had
many
more
but
patty
had
a
great
quantity
for
knowing
where
she
was
to
spend
her
christmas
all
her
young
friends
had
sent
gifts
to
her
at
the
farringtons
and
the
accumulation
was
almost
as
great
as
elise
i
helpless
said
patty
as
she
sat
with
her
lap
full
of
gifts
boxes
and
papers
strewn
all
about
her
on
the
floor
and
louise
or
hester
still
bringing
her
more
parcels
let
me
help
you
said
kenneth
as
he
picked
up
a
lot
of
her
belongings
as
he
was
only
a
dinner
guest
of
course
kenneth
had
no
such
array
of
gifts
though
the
farringtons
had
given
him
some
pretty
trifles
and
patty
gave
him
a
charming
little
tanagra
statuette
she
had
brought
from
florence
see
what
elise
gave
me
he
remarked
as
he
showed
the
bronze
jolly
is
it
yes
indeed
returned
patty
relieved
to
see
that
elise
had
not
given
him
the
ring
after
all
it
be
fine
to
cut
your
briefs
when
you
a
real
lawyer
what
are
briefs
anyway
little
girls
should
use
words
of
which
they
do
know
the
meaning
said
kenneth
reprovingly
well
anyway
if
they
brief
enough
they
wo
need
cutting
returned
patty
saucily
and
then
returned
to
the
opening
of
her
own
presents
she
had
pretty
little
gifts
from
hilda
henderson
lorraine
hamilton
clementine
morse
and
many
of
the
other
girls
some
of
whom
she
had
not
seen
since
her
return
to
new
york
is
it
lovely
to
have
so
many
friends
said
she
looking
over
her
pile
of
gifts
at
kenneth
do
you
love
them
all
he
asked
smiling
back
at
her
happy
face
oh
indeed
i
do
not
exactly
because
they
given
me
all
these
pretty
things
for
i
love
the
girls
just
as
much
in
the
summer
time
as
at
christmas
but
because
they
my
friends
and
so
i
love
them
boys
are
your
friends
too
suggested
kenneth
of
course
they
are
patty
agreed
and
i
love
them
too
i
guess
i
love
everybody
rather
a
big
order
said
roger
coming
up
just
then
loving
everybody
you
ca
give
a
very
large
portion
to
each
one
no
said
patty
pretending
to
look
downcast
now
is
that
bad
well
never
mind
i
plenty
of
gratitude
to
go
round
anyway
and
i
offer
you
a
big
share
of
that
roger
for
this
silver
box
do
you
like
it
oh
please
like
it
patty
of
course
i
do
it
exquisite
workmanship
and
i
shall
use
it
for
well
it
seems
most
too
prosaic
but
it
exactly
the
right
shape
and
size
for
hairpins
then
use
it
for
why
not
cried
roger
evidently
pleased
that
patty
could
find
a
use
for
his
gift
and
see
what
ken
gave
me
went
on
patty
as
she
held
up
a
small
crystal
ball
i
long
wanted
a
crystal
and
this
is
a
beauty
what
it
for
asked
roger
curiously
it
looks
like
a
marble
marble
indeed
why
roger
it
a
crystal
a
japanese
rock
crystal
is
it
glass
no
ignorant
one
is
not
glass
but
a
curio
of
rare
and
occult
value
in
it
i
read
the
future
the
past
and
the
present
yes
it
is
a
present
i
know
said
roger
and
in
the
laugh
at
this
sally
the
subject
was
dropped
but
roger
secretly
vowed
to
look
up
the
subject
of
crystals
and
find
out
why
patty
was
so
pleased
with
a
marble
elise
is
simply
snowed
under
said
kenneth
as
they
heard
rapturous
exclamations
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
where
elise
was
examining
her
gifts
think
of
it
cried
patty
she
had
everything
a
girl
could
possibly
want
yesterday
and
now
she
has
a
few
bushels
more
it
was
literally
true
getting
free
somehow
of
her
own
impedimenta
patty
ran
over
to
see
elise
things
you
look
like
a
fancy
bazaar
gone
to
smash
she
declared
as
she
saw
elise
in
the
midst
of
her
christmas
portion
i
feel
like
an
international
exhibition
returned
elise
i
gifts
from
all
parts
of
the
known
world
and
unknown
said
kenneth
picking
up
various
gimcracks
of
whose
name
or
use
he
had
no
idea
but
this
is
what
i
like
best
she
went
on
smiling
at
kenneth
as
she
held
up
the
dainty
little
he
had
given
her
i
shall
use
this
only
when
calling
on
my
dearest
friends
good
for
you
he
returned
glad
you
like
it
and
as
i
know
you
lots
of
dearest
friends
i
promise
when
it
worn
out
to
give
you
another
elise
looked
a
trifle
disappointed
at
this
offhand
response
to
her
more
earnest
speech
but
she
only
smiled
gaily
and
turned
the
subject
chapter
v
skating
and
dancing
kenneth
thinks
an
awful
lot
of
you
patty
said
elise
as
after
the
christmas
party
was
all
over
the
girls
were
indulging
in
a
chat
pooh
said
patty
who
in
kimono
and
bedroom
slippers
nestled
in
a
big
in
front
of
the
in
elise
known
ken
for
years
and
we
do
think
a
lot
of
each
other
but
you
take
that
tone
elise
it
a
boy
and
girl
chumminess
and
you
know
it
why
ken
does
think
any
more
of
me
than
roger
does
oh
roger
why
he
perfectly
gone
on
you
he
worships
the
ground
you
walk
on
surely
patty
you
noticed
roger
devotion
what
the
matter
with
you
elise
where
you
get
these
crazy
notions
about
devotion
and
worship
if
you
excuse
my
french
you
make
me
tired
do
you
like
to
have
the
boys
devoted
to
you
patty
no
i
do
i
like
their
jolly
friendship
of
course
i
like
to
talk
to
ken
and
roger
or
to
clifford
morse
or
any
of
the
boys
of
our
set
but
as
for
i
do
see
any
none
so
blind
as
those
who
wo
see
said
elise
who
had
finished
brushing
her
hair
and
now
sank
down
on
an
ottoman
by
patty
side
well
then
i
stay
blind
for
i
do
want
to
see
devoted
swains
worshipping
the
persian
rugs
i
walk
on
though
if
you
mean
these
beautiful
rugs
that
are
on
all
the
floors
of
your
house
elise
i
know
that
i
blame
the
swains
so
much
by
the
way
i
suppose
some
of
them
are
rugs
anyway
so
that
makes
it
all
the
more
appropriate
oh
patty
you
such
a
silly
you
not
like
other
girls
you
surprise
me
elise
also
you
flatter
me
i
had
an
idea
i
belonged
to
the
common
herd
patty
you
be
serious
roger
is
terribly
in
love
with
you
really
elise
how
interesting
now
what
would
you
do
in
a
case
like
that
i
consider
it
seriously
at
any
rate
patty
put
one
finger
to
her
forehead
frowned
deeply
and
gazed
into
the
fire
for
fully
half
a
minute
then
she
said
i
considered
elise
and
all
i
can
think
of
is
the
who
considered
very
well
and
gave
the
piper
a
penny
do
you
suppose
roger
would
care
for
a
penny
he
would
if
you
gave
it
to
him
returned
elise
who
was
almost
petulant
at
patty
continued
raillery
then
he
shall
have
it
rich
as
the
farringtons
are
if
the
son
of
the
house
wants
a
penny
of
my
fortune
it
shall
not
be
denied
him
patty
had
risen
and
was
stalking
up
and
down
the
room
with
jerky
strides
and
dramatic
waving
of
her
arms
her
golden
hair
hung
in
a
curly
cloud
over
her
blue
silk
kimono
and
her
voice
thrilled
with
a
tragic
intensity
though
of
course
exaggerated
to
a
ludicrous
degree
having
finished
her
speech
patty
retained
her
dramatic
pose
and
glared
at
elise
like
a
very
young
and
pretty
lady
macbeth
oh
patty
cried
elise
forgetting
the
subject
in
hand
you
ought
to
be
an
actress
do
you
know
you
were
quite
stunning
when
you
flung
yourself
round
so
and
patty
with
your
voice
your
singing
voice
i
mean
you
ought
to
go
on
the
stage
will
you
patty
i
love
to
see
you
an
opera
singer
elise
you
crazy
suppose
i
should
go
on
the
stage
what
would
become
of
all
these
devoted
swains
who
are
worshipping
my
feetsteps
bother
the
swains
patty
my
heart
is
set
upon
it
you
must
be
an
actress
i
mean
a
really
nice
gentle
refined
one
like
maude
adams
or
eleanor
robson
oh
they
are
so
sweet
and
such
noble
grand
women
elise
you
have
lovely
ambitions
for
your
friends
what
about
yourself
wo
you
be
a
dear
i
want
you
to
be
as
ambitious
for
you
as
you
are
for
me
patty
stop
your
fooling
i
was
quite
in
earnest
then
you
better
begin
fooling
it
more
sensible
than
your
earnestness
now
i
going
to
run
away
to
bed
and
leave
you
to
dream
that
you
a
whizzing
round
a
ring
on
a
arab
steed
girlie
alone
in
her
room
patty
smiled
to
herself
at
elise
foolishness
and
yet
though
she
had
no
desire
to
be
an
actress
patty
had
sometimes
dreamed
of
herself
as
a
concert
singer
enchanting
her
audiences
with
her
clear
sweet
voice
which
was
fine
and
true
if
not
great
she
was
ambitious
though
as
yet
not
definitely
so
and
elise
words
had
roused
a
dormant
desire
to
be
or
to
do
something
worth
while
and
not
as
she
thought
to
herself
be
a
mere
social
butterfly
then
she
smiled
again
as
she
thought
of
elise
talk
about
ken
and
roger
but
here
no
answering
chord
was
touched
as
chums
she
thoroughly
liked
both
boys
but
the
thought
of
any
more
serious
liking
only
roused
a
feeling
of
amusement
in
her
mind
perhaps
i
may
be
glad
to
have
somebody
in
love
with
me
some
day
she
thought
but
it
will
be
many
years
from
now
and
meantime
i
want
to
do
a
whole
lot
of
things
that
are
really
worth
doing
then
with
a
whimsical
thought
that
to
sleep
was
the
thing
most
worth
doing
at
the
present
moment
patty
tumbled
into
the
soft
white
nest
prepared
for
her
and
was
soon
sound
asleep
christmas
day
was
one
of
the
finest
no
snow
but
a
clear
cold
bracing
air
that
was
exhilarating
to
breathe
skating
this
afternoon
said
roger
after
the
merry
christmas
greetings
had
been
exchanged
yes
indeed
cried
patty
and
elise
in
one
breath
let
get
up
a
party
shall
us
went
on
roger
and
skate
till
dusk
and
then
all
come
back
here
and
have
tea
under
the
christmas
tree
lovely
cried
elise
but
patty
hesitated
you
know
we
have
the
dance
on
for
she
said
patty
was
not
robust
and
continuous
exertions
often
tired
her
nan
had
cautioned
her
not
to
attempt
too
much
gaiety
during
this
visit
and
she
wanted
to
rest
before
the
evening
dance
oh
pshaw
said
elise
there
be
lots
of
time
the
dance
wo
begin
till
nine
anyway
so
patty
agreed
and
roger
went
off
to
invite
his
skating
party
by
telephone
he
secured
kenneth
and
the
two
morses
and
then
he
hung
up
the
receiver
that
enough
he
declared
i
do
like
a
big
skating
party
slip
away
girls
and
get
your
bonnets
and
shawls
the
car
be
here
in
half
an
hour
the
girls
went
off
to
dress
and
patty
viewed
her
new
skating
costume
with
decided
approval
it
was
all
of
white
a
white
cloth
frock
with
short
skirt
white
broadcloth
coat
and
a
russian
turban
of
white
cloth
and
fur
long
white
leather
leggings
and
her
christmas
furs
which
added
a
charming
touch
to
the
costume
as
being
more
comfortable
for
skating
she
had
returned
to
her
former
mode
of
and
so
two
big
white
ribbon
bows
bloomed
at
the
back
of
her
head
these
and
the
short
skirt
quite
took
away
air
and
made
her
seem
a
little
girl
again
hello
baby
said
roger
as
he
saw
her
come
downstairs
with
rosy
cheeks
and
eyes
sparkling
with
pleasurable
anticipation
for
patty
loved
to
skate
said
patty
putting
her
finger
in
her
mouth
and
assuming
a
vacant
babyish
stare
roger
laughed
at
her
foolishness
and
then
elise
came
along
and
they
all
went
out
to
the
car
elise
suit
was
of
crimson
cloth
bordered
with
dark
fur
and
as
a
consequence
the
two
girls
together
made
a
pretty
picture
you
such
a
comfort
patty
elise
said
as
they
climbed
into
the
big
car
you
always
dress
just
right
to
harmonise
with
my
clothes
sure
you
do
said
roger
looking
at
the
two
girls
admiringly
no
fellow
on
the
ice
will
escort
such
beautiful
ladies
as
i
have
in
my
charge
now
we
pick
up
ken
and
the
morses
and
then
make
a
dash
for
the
pole
they
reached
the
park
by
three
so
had
nearly
two
hours
of
skating
before
the
dusk
fell
patty
was
a
superior
skater
and
so
were
most
of
the
others
for
roger
had
chosen
his
party
with
care
skate
with
me
patty
will
you
said
roger
just
at
the
same
moment
that
kenneth
said
of
course
you
skate
with
me
patty
patty
looked
at
both
boys
with
a
comical
smile
thank
you
she
said
but
i
always
like
to
pick
out
my
own
escort
then
turning
to
clifford
morse
she
said
skate
with
me
wo
you
cliff
we
a
good
team
we
are
that
he
replied
greatly
pleased
if
a
little
surprised
at
patty
invitation
kenneth
and
roger
grinned
at
each
other
and
then
turned
quickly
to
the
other
girls
who
had
not
heard
the
little
parley
of
course
roger
skated
with
clementine
morse
and
kenneth
with
elise
which
arrangement
quite
satisfied
the
beauty
you
look
like
little
red
said
kenneth
as
they
started
off
with
long
gliding
strokes
do
be
a
wolf
and
eat
me
up
laughed
elise
for
kenneth
had
fur
on
his
cap
and
overcoat
and
with
his
big
fur
gloves
seemed
almost
like
some
big
animal
you
skate
beautifully
elise
said
kenneth
and
all
you
girls
do
look
at
clementine
is
she
graceful
yes
agreed
elise
and
so
is
patty
patty
echoed
kenneth
she
is
a
poem
on
ice
she
was
and
elise
knew
it
but
a
naughty
little
jealousy
burned
in
her
heart
at
ken
words
she
bravely
tried
to
down
it
however
and
said
yes
she
is
she
a
poem
in
every
way
well
i
do
know
about
that
in
some
ways
she
more
of
a
jolly
merry
jingle
a
nonsense
rhyme
suggested
elise
falling
in
with
his
metaphor
yes
how
quick
you
are
to
see
what
i
mean
now
clementine
is
a
lyric
she
glides
so
gracefully
along
and
i
asked
elise
laughing
at
his
witty
characterisation
you
well
i
ca
judge
unless
i
see
you
skate
off
by
yourself
elise
did
so
and
kenneth
watched
the
figure
gracefully
pirouetting
and
skilfully
executing
difficult
steps
well
she
said
as
she
returned
to
him
and
again
they
joined
hands
and
glided
along
in
unison
well
you
delightful
on
ice
you
a
will
o
the
wisp
but
i
want
to
be
a
poem
of
some
sort
the
other
girls
are
kenneth
smiled
at
the
pretty
anxious
face
you
are
a
poem
you
one
of
those
little
french
forms
a
virelay
or
a
triolet
elise
was
a
little
uncertain
as
to
what
these
were
exactly
but
she
resolved
to
look
them
up
as
soon
as
she
reached
home
at
any
rate
she
knew
kenneth
meant
to
be
complimentary
and
she
smiled
with
pleasure
then
the
others
joined
them
and
they
all
skated
together
for
a
time
and
then
the
sun
set
and
roger
said
they
must
go
home
he
was
a
most
reliable
boy
and
always
took
charge
of
their
little
expeditions
or
outings
elise
never
thought
of
questioning
his
authority
so
again
they
all
bundled
into
the
car
and
started
homeward
i
ought
to
go
right
home
said
clementine
oh
come
round
for
a
cup
of
christmas
tea
said
roger
and
i
take
you
home
in
half
an
hour
so
the
morses
consented
and
the
six
merry
young
people
had
tea
under
the
christmas
tree
and
told
stories
by
the
firelight
and
laughed
and
chatted
until
clementine
declared
she
must
go
or
she
never
get
back
in
time
for
the
dance
what
are
you
going
to
wear
patsy
asked
elise
as
they
went
upstairs
arm
in
arm
i
a
new
frock
of
course
did
you
think
i
come
to
your
dance
in
one
i
worn
before
nay
i
hold
miss
farrington
in
too
high
esteem
for
that
well
scurry
into
it
for
i
crazy
to
see
it
if
it
prettier
than
mine
i
wo
let
you
go
down
to
the
ballroom
it
wo
be
returned
patty
do
worry
about
that
but
when
the
two
girls
were
dressed
patty
frock
though
not
so
expensive
was
quite
as
attractive
as
elise
patty
was
of
satin
veiled
all
over
with
a
delicate
thin
material
of
the
same
shade
a
pearl
trimming
encircled
the
slightly
throat
and
the
short
sleeves
it
was
very
becoming
to
pretty
patty
and
she
knew
herself
that
she
had
never
looked
better
elise
gown
was
of
white
silk
draped
with
silvered
lace
it
was
lovely
and
suited
elise
dark
hair
and
eyes
and
really
both
girls
were
pictures
but
patty
face
was
sunny
and
happy
while
elise
red
mouth
drooped
in
a
little
curve
of
discontent
the
girl
was
discontented
by
nature
and
though
she
had
everything
that
heart
could
wish
she
was
never
brimming
over
with
content
and
happiness
as
patty
always
was
the
dance
was
in
the
tennis
court
where
a
smooth
crash
had
replaced
the
snowy
floor
of
the
christmas
eve
celebration
the
christmas
tree
still
stood
there
as
it
formed
a
beautiful
decoration
for
that
end
of
the
ballroom
it
was
not
a
large
party
for
farrington
would
not
allow
elise
to
act
like
a
young
lady
out
in
society
about
thirty
young
people
were
asked
and
the
hours
were
from
nine
till
twelve
but
the
music
was
of
the
finest
and
as
patty
favourite
amusement
was
dancing
she
had
a
most
enjoyable
time
an
exquisite
dancer
she
was
of
course
besieged
by
partners
but
in
her
merry
wholehearted
way
she
treated
them
all
alike
showing
favouritism
to
none
and
dancing
with
less
desirable
partners
as
pleasantly
and
happily
as
with
those
she
liked
better
roger
grumbled
at
this
you
wasted
on
a
fellow
like
harry
barr
he
said
as
he
and
patty
started
for
a
turn
he
dances
like
a
and
yet
you
bob
along
with
him
as
smilingly
as
if
you
were
dancing
with
a
decent
tripper
why
not
returned
patty
he
pleasant
and
kind
he
does
like
a
and
he
ca
help
his
dancing
or
rather
his
lack
of
it
for
you
ca
call
those
gymnastics
of
his
dancing
oh
roger
there
mr
hepworth
sure
enough
hepworth
had
just
come
in
and
as
patty
spoke
he
caught
her
eye
and
smiled
she
smiled
back
and
when
the
dance
was
over
asked
roger
to
take
her
to
him
old
hepworth
said
roger
in
surprise
you
ca
waste
time
on
him
patty
your
dance
card
is
full
you
know
i
do
care
i
must
just
speak
to
him
i
have
seen
him
since
i
came
home
whoever
belongs
to
my
next
dance
can
wait
a
few
minutes
all
right
come
on
then
roger
led
her
across
the
room
and
with
a
smiling
face
and
in
tones
of
glad
welcome
she
said
oh
hepworth
how
do
you
do
patty
he
exclaimed
taking
her
hands
in
his
i
so
glad
to
see
you
again
there
was
a
thrill
in
his
voice
that
startled
her
but
she
only
said
and
so
am
i
glad
to
see
you
why
have
you
been
to
call
on
me
i
just
returned
from
a
southern
trip
only
reached
new
york
and
here
i
am
here
i
am
too
but
i
ca
talk
to
you
now
my
programme
is
full
and
i
make
it
a
point
always
to
keep
my
engagements
not
one
dance
left
said
hepworth
looking
over
the
scribbled
card
not
one
i
so
sorry
but
of
course
i
did
know
you
were
coming
of
course
not
run
along
now
and
enjoy
yourself
and
i
call
on
you
if
i
may
some
time
when
you
are
at
home
yes
do
said
patty
realising
that
hepworth
was
the
same
kind
thoughtful
friend
he
had
always
been
i
wonder
why
i
so
glad
to
see
him
she
thought
to
herself
as
she
walked
away
with
her
new
partner
but
i
am
all
the
same
chapter
vi
a
fair
proposition
it
was
on
the
afternoon
of
new
year
day
that
hepworth
came
to
call
on
patty
she
was
at
home
again
having
returned
from
her
visit
to
elise
a
few
days
after
christmas
you
know
i
am
he
said
as
he
greeted
the
fairfield
family
and
joined
their
circle
round
the
library
fire
but
i
suppose
you
thought
i
was
quite
so
as
to
make
calls
on
new
year
day
however
i
not
quite
doing
that
as
this
is
the
only
call
i
shall
make
we
glad
to
see
you
any
day
in
the
year
said
nan
cordially
and
patty
added
indeed
we
are
i
been
wondering
why
you
did
come
round
busy
said
hepworth
smiling
at
her
an
artist
life
is
not
a
leisure
one
is
anybody
asked
fairfield
the
tendency
of
the
age
is
to
rush
and
hurry
all
the
time
what
a
contrast
to
a
hundred
years
ago
and
a
good
contrast
too
declared
nan
if
the
world
still
jogged
along
at
a
hundred
years
ago
rate
we
would
have
no
no
a√´roplanes
no
no
north
pole
suggested
her
husband
true
enough
nan
to
accomplish
things
we
must
be
busy
i
want
to
get
busy
said
patty
no
i
do
mean
that
for
slang
as
her
father
looked
at
her
reprovingly
but
i
want
to
do
something
that
is
really
worth
while
the
usual
ambition
of
extreme
youth
said
hepworth
looking
at
her
kindly
if
quizzically
do
you
want
to
reform
the
world
and
in
what
way
not
exactly
reform
it
said
patty
smiling
back
at
him
reform
has
such
a
serious
sound
but
i
do
want
to
make
it
brighter
and
better
that
a
good
phrase
too
observed
hepworth
still
teasingly
but
patty
you
do
make
the
world
brighter
and
better
just
by
being
in
it
that
too
easy
and
anyway
i
expect
to
remain
in
it
for
some
several
years
yet
and
i
want
to
do
something
beside
just
ah
well
you
can
doubtless
find
some
outlet
for
your
enthusiasms
what
she
really
wants
said
her
father
is
to
be
an
operatic
star
and
sing
into
phonographs
added
nan
mischievously
yes
smiled
patty
and
have
my
picture
in
the
backs
of
magazines
that
right
said
hepworth
aim
high
while
you
about
it
i
can
aim
high
enough
returned
patty
but
i
not
sure
i
can
sing
high
enough
oh
you
only
need
to
come
high
enough
to
be
an
operatic
star
said
hepworth
who
was
in
merry
mood
but
seriously
said
patty
who
was
in
earnest
mood
i
do
want
to
do
good
i
do
mean
in
a
public
way
but
in
a
charity
way
oh
and
no
not
exactly
i
mean
to
help
people
who
have
no
sweetness
and
light
in
their
lives
oh
patty
groaned
nan
if
you
on
that
tack
you
hopeless
what
have
you
been
reading
young
maiden
own
ruskin
or
up
and
not
down
and
lend
a
ten
supplemented
fairfield
you
need
laugh
began
patty
pouting
a
little
then
she
laughed
herself
and
went
on
yes
you
may
laugh
if
you
want
to
i
know
i
sound
ridiculous
but
i
tell
you
people
i
going
to
make
good
you
may
make
good
said
her
father
but
you
never
be
good
until
you
stop
using
slang
how
often
my
daughter
have
i
told
you
oh
cut
it
out
daddy
said
patty
dimpling
with
laughter
for
she
knew
her
occasional
slang
phrases
amused
her
father
even
though
they
annoyed
him
if
you
help
me
noble
things
not
dream
them
all
day
long
i
promise
to
talk
only
in
purest
english
undefiled
goodness
patty
said
nan
you
a
walking
cyclop√¶dia
of
poetical
quotations
and
you
a
running
commentary
on
them
returned
patty
promptly
which
remark
sent
hepworth
off
in
peals
of
laughter
oh
patty
he
exclaimed
i
afraid
you
going
to
grow
up
clever
that
would
be
fatal
to
your
ambition
be
good
sweet
child
and
let
who
will
be
clever
nobody
can
be
both
i
can
declared
patty
i
show
you
missouri
people
yet
fairfield
groaned
at
this
new
burst
of
slang
but
hepworth
only
laughed
she
get
over
it
he
said
a
few
years
of
these
aims
of
hers
will
make
her
so
that
she
wo
even
see
the
meaning
of
a
slang
phrase
though
i
must
admit
i
think
some
of
them
very
apt
myself
they
sure
are
said
irrepressible
patty
giggling
at
her
frown
but
i
tell
you
one
thing
went
on
hepworth
whatever
line
you
decide
upon
let
it
be
something
that
needs
no
training
i
mean
if
you
choose
to
go
in
for
organised
charity
or
settlement
work
well
and
good
but
do
attempt
red
cross
nursing
or
kindergarten
teaching
or
anything
that
requires
technical
knowledge
for
in
these
days
only
trained
labour
succeeds
and
only
expert
at
that
oh
pshaw
said
patty
i
do
mean
to
earn
money
though
if
i
wanted
to
i
sure
i
could
why
if
i
to
earn
my
own
living
i
could
do
it
as
easy
as
anything
i
not
so
sure
of
that
said
hepworth
gravely
it
is
so
easy
for
a
young
woman
to
earn
her
living
without
a
technical
education
in
some
line
well
patty
you
never
have
to
earn
your
own
living
said
her
father
smiling
so
do
worry
about
that
but
i
agree
with
our
friend
that
you
could
do
it
if
you
did
have
to
that
sounds
so
irish
daddy
that
i
think
it
as
bad
as
slang
however
i
see
you
are
all
of
unsympathetic
nature
so
i
wo
confide
in
you
further
as
to
my
aims
or
ambitions
i
have
noticed
any
confidences
yet
murmured
nan
only
appeals
for
help
patty
gave
her
a
withering
glance
the
subject
is
dropped
she
said
let
us
now
talk
about
the
weather
no
said
hepworth
let
me
tell
you
a
story
let
me
tell
you
of
a
girl
i
met
down
south
who
if
she
only
had
patty
determination
and
force
of
character
might
achieve
success
and
even
renown
do
tell
us
about
her
said
nan
for
hepworth
was
always
an
interesting
talker
she
lives
in
virginia
and
her
name
is
christine
farley
a
friend
of
mine
down
there
asked
me
to
look
at
some
of
her
drawings
and
i
saw
at
once
that
the
girl
has
real
talent
if
not
genius
of
course
you
would
know
said
nan
for
hepworth
himself
was
a
portrait
painter
of
high
repute
yes
she
really
has
done
some
remarkable
work
but
she
is
poor
and
lives
in
a
small
country
town
she
has
already
learned
all
the
local
teachers
can
give
her
and
needs
the
technical
training
of
a
good
art
school
with
a
year
of
such
training
she
could
easily
become
i
am
sure
a
successful
illustrator
at
least
after
a
year
study
i
know
she
could
get
good
work
to
do
and
then
she
would
rapidly
become
known
ca
she
manage
to
do
this
in
some
way
asked
fairfield
no
she
is
ambitious
in
her
work
but
in
no
other
way
she
is
shy
and
timid
a
country
girl
inexperienced
in
the
ways
of
the
world
ignorant
of
city
life
and
desperately
afraid
of
new
york
which
to
her
is
a
name
for
all
unknown
terrors
goose
said
patty
oh
i
sorry
for
her
of
course
but
as
an
american
girl
she
ought
to
have
more
spunk
southern
girls
do
have
spunk
patty
said
her
father
with
a
merry
twinkle
in
his
eye
do
they
well
i
guess
i
ought
to
know
i
a
southern
girl
myself
at
least
i
was
until
i
was
fourteen
perhaps
you
achieved
your
spunk
since
you
came
north
then
said
hepworth
for
i
agree
with
your
father
southern
girls
do
not
have
much
energy
of
character
at
least
miss
farley
has
she
about
nineteen
or
twenty
but
she
as
childish
as
a
girl
of
fourteen
except
in
her
work
there
she
excels
any
one
of
her
age
i
ever
known
can
nothing
be
done
in
the
matter
asked
nan
i
do
know
i
told
they
very
proud
people
and
would
not
accept
charity
of
course
she
never
can
earn
anything
by
her
work
if
she
stays
at
home
and
as
she
ca
get
away
it
seems
to
be
a
deadlock
i
like
to
help
her
said
patty
slowly
i
do
think
she
ought
to
have
ingenuity
enough
to
help
herself
but
if
she
has
i
like
to
help
her
how
can
you
asked
nan
i
do
know
but
the
way
to
find
out
how
to
do
things
is
to
do
them
oh
dear
moaned
hepworth
in
mock
despair
i
said
i
feared
you
were
clever
do
say
those
things
patty
you
ruin
your
reputation
as
a
beauty
pooh
said
patty
who
sometimes
did
know
whether
hepworth
was
teasing
her
or
not
that
is
a
clever
thing
to
say
well
if
you
do
mean
it
for
an
epigram
i
forgive
you
but
let
it
happen
again
now
as
to
christine
farley
i
let
you
be
clever
for
once
if
you
turn
your
cleverness
to
devising
some
way
to
aid
her
to
an
art
education
can
you
think
of
any
way
i
can
think
of
dozens
returned
patty
but
the
only
thing
to
do
is
for
her
to
come
to
new
york
get
a
scholarship
at
the
art
school
and
then
board
in
a
hall
bedroom
art
students
always
do
that
and
they
have
jolly
good
times
with
chafing
dishes
and
palette
knives
and
such
things
i
read
about
yes
said
hepworth
but
how
is
she
to
pay
the
board
for
the
hall
bedroom
they
are
really
quite
poor
i
told
well
said
patty
scornfully
anybody
the
merest
infant
could
earn
enough
money
outside
class
hours
to
pay
a
small
sum
like
that
i
should
hope
why
how
much
would
such
board
cost
patty
child
said
her
father
you
do
know
much
of
social
economics
do
you
i
fancy
the
young
woman
could
board
properly
for
about
twelve
or
fifteen
dollars
a
week
eh
hepworth
yes
i
daresay
fifteen
dollars
a
week
would
cover
her
expenses
including
her
art
materials
of
course
this
would
mean
literally
the
bedroom
in
a
very
modest
well
went
on
patty
and
do
you
mean
to
say
that
this
girl
earn
fifteen
dollars
a
week
and
attend
her
classes
too
i
mean
to
say
just
that
said
hepworth
seriously
i
agree
with
you
said
nan
why
i
could
earn
fifteen
dollars
a
week
and
stay
at
home
from
the
classes
oh
nan
cried
patty
you
could
i
sure
you
could
why
i
bet
i
could
earn
fifteen
dollars
a
week
and
have
plenty
of
time
left
for
my
practising
my
club
meetings
motoring
skating
and
all
the
things
i
want
to
do
beside
fifteen
dollars
a
week
is
gently
gently
my
girl
said
her
father
for
patty
cheeks
were
pink
with
the
earnestness
of
her
argument
fifteen
dollars
a
week
seems
nothing
to
you
because
you
have
all
the
money
you
want
but
where
is
your
sense
of
proportion
your
idea
of
relative
values
the
value
of
fifteen
dollars
handed
out
to
you
willingly
by
a
loving
father
or
the
value
of
fifteen
dollars
earned
from
a
grudging
employer
are
totally
different
matters
i
do
care
said
patty
i
know
i
could
earn
that
much
a
week
and
i
believe
this
other
girl
could
do
so
if
she
had
somebody
to
make
her
think
she
could
there
a
good
deal
in
that
said
hepworth
thoughtfully
miss
farley
does
need
somebody
to
make
her
think
she
can
do
things
but
the
life
of
an
art
student
is
a
busy
one
and
i
sure
she
could
earn
much
money
while
she
studying
but
fifteen
dollars
a
week
is
much
persisted
patty
anybody
could
earn
that
look
here
puss
said
her
father
sometimes
you
show
a
bravery
of
assertion
that
ought
to
be
put
to
the
test
now
i
make
a
proposition
to
you
in
the
presence
of
these
two
witnesses
if
you
earn
fifteen
dollars
in
one
week
any
week
i
agree
to
pay
the
board
of
this
miss
farley
in
new
york
for
a
year
while
she
pursues
her
art
studies
oh
father
will
you
cried
patty
what
a
duck
you
are
of
course
i
can
earn
the
money
easily
wait
a
moment
there
are
conditions
or
rather
stipulations
you
must
not
do
anything
unbecoming
a
quiet
refined
girl
but
i
know
you
would
do
that
anyway
you
must
not
engage
in
any
pursuit
that
keeps
you
away
from
your
home
after
five
in
the
afternoon
oh
interrupted
patty
i
do
propose
to
go
out
washing
i
shall
do
light
work
of
some
sort
at
home
but
never
you
mind
what
i
do
of
course
it
will
be
nothing
you
could
possibly
object
to
i
earn
fifteen
dollars
in
less
than
a
week
a
week
though
is
the
proposition
when
you
bring
me
fifteen
dollars
earned
by
yourself
unassisted
in
the
space
of
seven
days
i
carry
out
my
part
of
the
bargain
but
the
girl
wo
accept
it
said
patty
regretfully
i
trusting
to
your
tact
and
nan
to
offer
the
opportunity
to
her
in
such
a
way
that
she
will
accept
it
could
that
be
done
hepworth
why
yes
i
daresay
it
could
be
managed
and
you
are
very
generous
fairfield
but
i
ca
say
i
have
much
hope
of
patty
success
success
is
always
a
foregone
conclusion
said
that
young
woman
saucily
and
now
at
last
i
have
an
aim
in
life
i
shall
begin
and
we
see
the
others
laughed
for
no
one
could
take
pretty
patty
very
seriously
except
herself
but
do
tell
anybody
she
added
as
the
doorbell
rang
they
all
promised
they
would
and
then
elise
and
roger
came
in
to
bring
new
year
greetings
and
the
conversation
took
a
lighter
and
merrier
turn
chapter
vii
department
g
alone
in
her
own
room
that
same
night
patty
thought
out
her
great
project
she
was
not
at
all
doubtful
of
her
success
she
was
only
choosing
among
the
various
methods
of
earning
money
that
occurred
to
her
all
were
easy
and
some
of
them
even
seemed
delightful
occupations
father
is
an
angel
she
thought
to
herself
a
big
splendid
angel
he
knew
i
could
do
my
part
easily
enough
and
he
only
made
it
a
stipulation
because
he
did
want
to
shoulder
the
whole
affair
outright
he
wanted
me
to
feel
i
had
a
hand
in
it
he
so
tactful
and
dear
well
i
do
my
part
so
well
he
have
nothing
to
complain
of
then
i
get
nan
to
write
to
the
girl
and
invite
her
here
for
a
few
days
or
a
week
then
i
rather
guess
we
can
gently
persuade
her
to
accept
the
goods
the
gods
provide
considering
the
matter
as
settled
patty
went
to
sleep
and
dreamed
happily
of
her
coming
triumphs
as
a
do
you
go
to
business
miss
fairfield
asked
her
father
at
the
breakfast
table
yes
fairfield
that
is
i
shall
occupy
myself
with
my
with
my
occupation
indeed
that
is
logical
at
any
rate
would
it
be
indiscreet
to
inquire
the
nature
of
said
occupation
it
would
be
not
only
indiscreet
but
useless
for
i
decline
to
tell
but
it
is
work
i
shall
do
at
home
i
no
desire
to
enter
an
office
and
you
do
need
a
stenographer
anyway
do
you
no
and
if
i
did
i
should
take
you
you
too
young
and
too
not
desirable
traits
in
office
work
i
may
get
over
them
both
said
patty
smiling
at
him
you
probably
will
said
nan
before
you
succeeded
in
this
ridiculous
scheme
you
undertaken
now
nannikins
do
desert
micawber
in
that
cruel
fashion
patty
flung
back
gaily
the
game
never
out
till
it
played
out
you
know
and
this
game
is
even
yet
begun
you
be
played
out
before
the
game
is
said
her
father
oh
daddy
i
that
slang
i
am
truly
so
well
mind
now
puss
you
not
to
tire
yourself
too
much
remember
when
you
worked
yourself
to
death
at
your
commencement
celebration
yes
but
i
had
a
lot
of
experience
since
that
and
i
much
weller
and
stronger
yes
you
well
but
you
not
of
a
very
strong
constitution
and
never
will
be
so
remember
and
do
overdo
not
i
can
earn
fifteen
dollars
a
week
and
more
too
i
know
without
overdoing
myself
then
i
must
be
off
i
hear
the
report
of
your
first
day
work
the
family
separated
and
patty
ran
singing
away
to
make
her
preparations
for
the
campaign
what
you
doing
asked
nan
as
she
went
rummaging
in
the
linen
closet
nothing
naughty
replied
patty
giggling
curb
your
curiosity
stepmothery
for
it
wo
be
gratified
nan
laughed
and
went
away
and
patty
proceeded
to
select
certain
very
pretty
embroidered
doilies
and
centrepieces
two
of
each
these
she
laid
carefully
in
a
flat
box
which
she
tied
up
into
a
neat
parcel
then
she
put
on
her
plainest
cloth
suit
and
a
small
dark
hat
and
was
ready
to
start
nan
she
said
looking
in
at
the
library
door
what
time
do
you
want
the
motor
oh
about
eleven
or
twelve
keep
it
as
long
as
you
like
it
only
ten
now
i
be
back
in
less
than
an
hour
i
sure
returned
nan
good
luck
to
you
she
thought
patty
scheme
ridiculous
but
harmless
for
she
knew
the
girl
well
enough
to
know
she
would
do
anything
that
might
lead
her
into
an
unpleasant
position
but
she
feared
that
her
boundless
enthusiasm
would
urge
her
on
beyond
the
bounds
of
her
nervous
strength
though
soundly
healthy
patty
was
and
stopped
at
no
amount
of
exertion
to
attain
a
desired
end
more
than
once
this
nervous
energy
of
hers
had
caused
physical
collapse
which
was
what
nan
feared
for
her
now
but
patty
feared
nothing
for
herself
and
going
out
to
the
waiting
she
gave
the
chauffeur
an
address
down
in
the
lower
part
of
broadway
it
was
so
unusual
that
miller
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
said
deferentially
this
is
downtown
miss
patty
are
you
sure
the
number
is
right
yes
that
all
right
she
returned
smiling
go
ahead
so
he
went
ahead
and
after
a
long
ride
southward
the
car
stopped
in
the
crowded
mercantile
portion
of
lower
broadway
patty
got
out
and
looked
a
little
apprehensively
at
the
unfamiliar
surroundings
wait
for
me
she
said
to
miller
and
then
turned
determinedly
to
the
door
yes
the
number
was
right
there
was
the
sign
monongahela
art
embroidery
company
on
the
window
patty
opened
the
big
door
and
went
in
she
had
fancied
it
would
be
like
the
shops
to
which
she
was
accustomed
where
polite
stepped
up
and
asked
her
wishes
but
it
was
not
at
all
like
that
it
was
more
like
a
large
warehouse
partitions
that
rose
only
part
way
to
the
ceiling
divided
off
small
rooms
or
departments
all
of
which
were
piled
high
with
boxes
or
crates
the
aisles
between
these
were
narrow
and
the
whole
place
was
rather
dark
moreover
there
seemed
to
be
nobody
about
patty
sat
down
in
a
chair
and
waited
a
few
moments
but
no
one
appeared
so
she
got
up
again
here
where
i
need
my
pluck
she
said
to
herself
not
frightened
but
wondering
at
the
situation
i
go
ahead
but
i
feel
like
alice
in
wonderland
i
know
i
fall
into
a
treacle
well
she
traversed
half
the
length
of
the
long
building
when
she
saw
a
man
writing
in
one
of
the
small
compartments
he
looked
up
at
her
and
then
apparently
without
interest
in
her
presence
there
resumed
his
work
patty
was
a
little
annoyed
at
what
she
thought
discourtesy
and
said
i
come
to
answer
your
advertisement
fourth
floor
said
the
man
indicating
the
direction
by
pointing
his
penholder
across
the
room
but
not
looking
up
thank
you
said
patty
in
a
tone
intended
to
rebuke
his
own
lack
of
manners
but
he
only
went
on
writing
and
she
turned
to
look
for
the
elevator
she
could
see
none
however
so
she
walked
on
thinking
how
like
a
maze
was
this
succession
of
small
rooms
and
little
cross
aisles
when
she
saw
another
man
writing
in
another
coop
she
said
politely
will
you
please
direct
me
to
the
elevator
what
said
the
man
looking
at
her
patty
repeated
her
request
ai
none
he
said
want
work
though
unpolished
he
was
not
rude
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
patty
said
yes
i
do
have
to
hoof
it
then
three
flights
up
department
all
right
said
patty
whose
spirits
always
rose
when
she
encountered
difficulties
she
saw
the
staircase
now
a
rough
wooden
structure
of
unplaned
boards
and
no
balusters
but
she
trudged
up
the
long
flight
hopefully
the
next
floor
seemed
to
be
full
of
whirring
looms
and
the
noise
was
as
patty
described
it
afterward
like
the
buzzing
of
a
billion
bees
but
asking
no
further
directions
she
ascended
the
next
staircase
and
the
next
until
she
found
herself
on
the
fourth
floor
several
people
were
bustling
about
here
all
seeming
to
be
very
busy
and
preoccupied
where
is
department
g
she
inquired
of
a
man
hurrying
by
ask
at
the
desk
he
replied
without
pausing
this
was
ambiguous
as
there
were
more
than
a
score
of
desks
about
each
tenanted
by
a
busy
man
more
often
than
not
accompanied
by
a
stenographer
oh
dear
what
a
place
thought
patty
no
one
would
attend
to
her
wants
no
one
seemed
to
notice
her
she
believed
she
could
stand
there
all
day
if
she
chose
without
being
spoken
to
clearly
she
must
take
the
initiative
she
saw
a
woman
at
a
desk
and
decided
to
address
her
where
is
department
g
please
she
asked
g
said
the
woman
looking
blank
yes
the
man
downstairs
told
me
it
was
on
the
fourth
floor
this
the
fourth
floor
yes
it
is
then
where
is
department
g
g
yes
i
do
know
i
sure
who
does
know
i
do
know
the
absurdity
of
this
conversation
made
patty
smile
which
seemed
to
irritate
the
other
i
ca
help
it
if
i
do
know
she
snapped
out
i
new
here
myself
only
came
yesterday
i
do
know
where
g
is
i
sure
excuse
me
said
patty
sorry
that
she
had
smiled
and
she
turned
away
she
caught
a
boy
as
he
passed
whistling
and
said
do
know
where
department
g
is
sure
said
the
boy
grinning
at
her
sashay
straight
acrost
de
room
pipe
de
guy
wit
de
goggles
thank
you
said
patty
restraining
her
desire
to
smile
at
the
funny
little
chap
she
went
over
to
the
desk
indicated
the
man
seated
there
looked
at
her
over
his
glasses
and
said
to
embroider
yes
said
patty
take
a
chair
wait
a
few
moments
i
busy
relieved
at
having
reached
her
goal
patty
sat
down
in
the
chair
indicated
and
waited
she
waited
five
minutes
and
then
ten
and
then
fifteen
the
man
was
busy
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
he
dashed
off
memoranda
gave
them
to
messengers
telephoned
whisked
drawers
open
and
shut
and
seemed
to
be
in
a
very
whirl
of
business
as
there
was
no
indication
of
a
cessation
patty
grew
impatient
at
last
and
said
can
you
attend
to
my
business
soon
if
not
i
call
some
other
day
yes
said
the
man
passing
his
hand
across
his
brow
a
little
wearily
he
looked
tired
and
overworked
and
patty
felt
sorry
for
him
but
he
whirled
round
in
his
office
chair
and
asked
her
quite
civilly
what
she
wanted
you
advertised
for
embroiderers
began
patty
feeling
rather
small
and
worthless
so
i
came
yes
yes
said
the
man
as
she
paused
can
you
embroider
we
use
only
the
best
have
you
samples
of
your
work
i
have
said
patty
beginning
to
untie
her
box
but
her
fingers
trembled
and
she
could
unknot
the
cord
the
man
took
it
from
her
not
rudely
but
as
if
every
moment
were
precious
deftly
he
opened
the
parcel
and
gave
a
quick
glance
at
exquisite
needlework
on
the
doilies
and
centrepieces
she
had
brought
do
it
yourself
he
asked
already
closing
the
box
again
yes
of
course
said
patty
indignant
at
the
implication
no
offence
that
all
right
your
work
goes
report
at
department
b
he
handed
her
the
box
whirled
round
to
his
desk
and
was
immediately
at
his
work
again
patty
realised
she
was
dismissed
and
taking
her
box
she
started
for
the
stairs
she
passed
the
boy
again
and
feeling
almost
as
if
she
were
meeting
an
old
friend
in
a
strange
land
she
said
where
is
department
b
caught
on
didjer
he
grinned
good
fer
youse
b
first
floor
that
way
he
pointed
a
grimy
finger
in
the
direction
she
should
take
and
went
on
whistling
down
the
three
flights
of
stairs
went
patty
and
thanks
to
the
clarity
of
the
one
direction
she
soon
found
department
b
this
was
in
charge
of
a
woman
rather
past
middle
age
sent
by
mr
myers
she
inquired
looking
at
patty
coldly
i
was
sent
by
the
man
in
department
g
returned
patty
he
said
my
work
would
do
and
that
i
was
to
report
to
you
all
right
how
much
do
you
want
said
the
woman
how
much
do
you
pay
returned
patty
do
be
impertinent
miss
i
mean
how
much
work
do
you
want
oh
said
patty
who
was
quite
innocent
of
any
intent
to
offend
why
i
want
enough
to
last
a
week
well
that
depends
on
how
fast
you
work
said
the
woman
speaking
with
some
asperity
come
now
do
you
want
a
dozen
or
two
dozen
or
what
patty
was
strongly
tempted
to
say
what
thank
you
but
she
refrained
knowing
it
was
no
occasion
for
foolery
i
do
know
till
i
see
them
she
replied
are
they
elaborate
pieces
here
they
are
said
the
woman
taking
some
pieces
of
work
from
a
box
her
tone
seemed
to
imply
that
she
was
conferring
an
enormous
favour
on
patty
by
showing
them
they
were
rather
large
centrepieces
all
of
the
same
pattern
which
was
stamped
but
not
embroidered
there
a
lot
of
work
on
those
remarked
patty
oh
you
green
said
the
woman
she
jerked
out
another
similar
centrepiece
on
which
a
small
section
perhaps
of
the
whole
was
worked
in
silks
this
is
what
you
to
do
she
explained
in
a
tired
cross
voice
you
work
this
corner
and
that
all
who
works
the
rest
asked
patty
amazed
at
this
plan
why
the
buyer
we
sell
these
to
the
shops
they
sell
them
to
people
who
use
this
finished
corner
as
a
guide
to
do
the
rest
of
the
piece
you
understand
yes
i
can
now
that
you
explain
it
returned
patty
then
if
i
take
a
dozen
i
to
work
just
that
little
corner
on
each
one
is
that
it
that
it
said
the
woman
wearily
as
if
she
were
making
the
explanation
for
the
thousandth
time
as
she
probably
was
you
can
take
this
as
a
guide
for
yourself
she
went
on
a
little
more
kindly
and
here
the
silks
did
you
say
a
dozen
wait
a
minute
said
patty
how
much
do
you
pay
five
dollars
apiece
i
suppose
yes
i
take
a
dozen
the
woman
gave
a
hard
little
laugh
five
dollars
apiece
she
said
not
much
we
pay
five
dollars
a
dozen
a
dozen
five
dollars
for
all
that
work
why
each
of
those
corners
is
as
much
work
as
a
whole
doily
yes
just
about
do
you
work
fast
yes
pretty
fast
patty
was
doing
some
mental
calculation
three
dozen
of
those
pieces
meant
an
interminable
lot
of
work
but
it
also
meant
fifteen
dollars
and
patty
spirit
was
now
fully
roused
i
take
three
dozen
she
said
decidedly
and
i
bring
them
back
finished
a
week
from
my
you
must
be
a
swift
worker
said
the
woman
in
a
disinterested
voice
she
was
already
sorting
out
silks
as
with
a
practised
hand
and
making
all
into
a
parcel
patty
was
about
to
offer
her
a
visiting
card
as
she
assumed
she
must
give
her
address
when
the
woman
said
eighteen
dollars
please
what
said
patty
what
for
security
you
do
suppose
we
let
everybody
walk
off
with
our
materials
and
never
come
back
do
you
do
you
doubt
my
honesty
said
patty
haughtily
do
doubt
anybody
honesty
was
the
reply
some
folks
do
have
any
to
doubt
but
it
the
rule
of
the
house
six
dollars
a
dozen
is
the
deposit
price
for
that
pattern
but
eighteen
dollars
is
more
than
you
going
to
pay
me
for
the
work
said
patty
yes
said
the
woman
but
ca
you
understand
this
is
a
deposit
to
protect
ourselves
if
you
never
return
or
if
you
spoil
the
work
if
you
bring
it
back
in
satisfactory
condition
at
the
appointed
time
we
return
your
deposit
and
pay
you
the
price
agreed
upon
for
the
work
oh
i
see
said
patty
taking
out
her
purse
and
it
does
seem
fair
but
is
it
hard
for
poor
girls
to
put
up
that
deposit
yes
it
is
the
woman
face
softened
a
little
but
they
get
it
back
if
they
do
the
work
right
and
suppose
i
bring
it
back
unfinished
or
only
part
done
if
what
you
do
is
done
right
you
get
paid
and
if
the
pieces
you
do
do
are
unsoiled
and
in
good
condition
we
redeem
them
but
if
you
care
for
steady
work
here
you
better
not
take
you
can
accomplish
thank
you
said
patty
slowly
i
keep
the
three
dozen
said
the
woman
curtly
and
turned
away
with
a
tired
sigh
patty
went
out
to
the
street
and
found
miller
looking
exceedingly
anxious
about
the
prolonged
absence
of
his
young
mistress
a
look
of
relief
overspread
his
face
as
she
appeared
and
when
she
got
into
the
car
and
said
home
miller
he
started
with
an
air
of
decided
satisfaction
chapter
viii
embroidered
blossoms
it
was
after
twelve
when
patty
reached
home
and
she
found
nan
with
her
wraps
on
rather
anxiously
awaiting
her
patty
wherever
have
you
been
all
this
time
she
cried
as
patty
came
in
with
her
big
bundle
laying
the
foundations
of
my
great
career
and
oh
nan
it
was
pretty
awful
i
in
for
it
i
can
tell
you
what
a
goose
you
are
but
nan
smiled
affectionately
at
the
rosy
excited
face
of
her
stepdaughter
well
i
going
out
on
a
short
errand
patty
i
be
home
to
luncheon
at
one
and
then
you
must
tell
me
all
about
it
patty
ran
up
to
her
own
room
and
flinging
off
her
hat
and
coat
sat
down
to
open
her
bundle
of
work
it
was
appalling
the
portion
to
be
embroidered
looked
larger
than
it
had
done
in
the
shop
and
the
pattern
was
one
of
the
most
intricate
and
elaborate
she
had
ever
seen
thank
goodness
they
all
alike
thought
poor
patty
after
i
do
one
the
others
will
be
easier
she
flew
for
her
embroidery
hoops
and
and
began
at
once
on
one
of
the
centrepieces
the
pattern
was
a
floral
design
tied
with
and
interlaced
with
a
conventional
the
shading
of
the
blossoms
was
complicated
and
showed
many
shades
of
each
colour
the
were
of
a
solid
colour
but
required
close
fine
stitches
of
a
tedious
nature
while
the
part
seemed
to
present
an
interminable
task
patty
was
a
skilful
embroiderer
and
realised
at
her
first
glance
that
she
had
a
fearful
amount
of
work
before
her
but
as
yet
she
was
undismayed
and
cheerfully
started
in
on
the
flowers
she
selected
the
right
silks
cut
the
skeins
neatly
and
put
them
in
thread
papers
for
she
thought
if
i
allow
my
silks
to
get
tangled
or
mixed
up
it
will
delay
me
of
course
at
one
nan
came
to
her
room
did
you
hear
the
luncheon
gong
she
said
no
replied
patty
looking
up
is
it
one
already
for
goodness
gracious
sake
patty
what
you
doing
is
your
yes
said
patty
proudly
displaying
a
wild
rose
beautifully
worked
and
carefully
tinted
do
i
do
it
nicely
indeed
you
do
your
embroidery
is
always
exquisite
but
are
you
going
to
work
that
whole
centrepiece
no
only
a
section
see
just
this
much
patty
indicated
the
portion
she
was
to
work
but
she
did
say
that
she
had
more
carefully
laid
away
in
a
box
to
do
within
the
week
well
agreed
nan
that
not
such
a
terrific
task
but
will
they
give
you
fifteen
dollars
for
that
piece
no
said
patty
smiling
a
little
grimly
but
there
are
others
oho
a
lot
of
them
a
dozen
i
suppose
they
always
give
out
work
by
dozens
well
girlie
i
do
want
to
be
discouraging
but
you
ca
do
a
dozen
in
a
week
come
on
down
to
luncheon
at
the
table
patty
gave
nan
a
graphic
description
of
her
experiences
though
more
or
less
shocked
at
the
whole
performance
nan
could
help
laughing
at
patty
dramatic
recital
and
the
way
in
which
she
mimicked
the
various
people
and
yet
nan
she
said
it
really
pathetic
they
all
seemed
so
busy
and
so
tired
the
woman
who
gave
me
the
work
was
like
a
machine
as
if
she
just
fed
out
centrepieces
to
people
who
came
for
them
i
sure
she
has
smiled
for
fourteen
years
the
only
gay
one
in
the
place
was
the
boy
and
he
talked
such
fearful
slang
it
cured
me
of
ever
using
it
again
father
will
be
glad
of
that
anyway
hereafter
i
shall
converse
in
henry
james
diction
why
nan
he
said
de
guy
wit
de
goggles
what
did
he
mean
asked
nan
puzzled
oh
he
meant
the
gentleman
wearing
spectacles
how
did
you
know
intuition
i
suppose
and
then
he
pointed
to
the
man
in
question
patty
you
get
more
slangy
still
if
you
go
among
such
people
no
i
wo
there
no
cure
like
an
awful
example
watch
the
elegance
of
my
conversation
from
now
on
and
besides
nan
you
must
act
as
if
i
associated
with
them
socially
i
assure
you
i
was
quite
the
haughty
lady
but
that
slangy
boy
was
an
angel
unawares
i
probably
be
there
yet
but
for
his
kindly
aid
well
i
suppose
you
have
to
carry
this
absurd
scheme
through
and
patty
i
help
you
in
any
way
i
can
do
you
want
me
to
wind
silks
or
something
no
ducky
stepmother
of
mine
the
only
way
you
can
help
is
to
head
off
callers
i
can
do
the
work
if
i
can
keep
at
it
but
if
the
girls
come
bothering
round
i
never
get
it
done
now
this
afternoon
i
want
to
do
a
lot
so
if
any
one
asks
for
me
wo
you
gently
but
firmly
refuse
to
let
them
see
me
make
yourself
so
entertaining
that
they
forget
my
existence
i
try
said
nan
dubiously
but
if
it
elise
or
clementine
they
insist
on
seeing
you
let
insist
tell
i
have
a
sick
headache
for
i
feel
sure
i
shall
before
the
afternoon
over
now
patty
i
wo
have
that
sort
of
thing
you
may
work
an
hour
or
so
then
you
must
rest
or
go
for
a
drive
or
chat
with
the
girls
or
something
i
will
other
days
nan
but
i
want
to
put
in
the
solid
afternoon
working
so
i
know
how
much
i
can
accomplish
have
you
really
a
dozen
of
those
things
to
do
patty
yes
i
have
patty
did
dare
say
she
had
three
dozen
and
if
i
do
well
this
afternoon
i
can
calculate
how
long
the
work
will
take
oh
nan
i
do
want
to
succeed
it
is
only
the
work
you
know
it
the
principle
i
hate
to
be
baffled
and
i
be
a
stubborn
look
came
into
patty
pretty
eyes
a
look
which
nan
knew
well
a
look
which
meant
that
the
indomitable
will
might
be
broken
but
not
bent
and
that
patty
would
persevere
in
her
chosen
course
until
she
conquered
or
was
herself
defeated
so
after
luncheon
she
returned
to
her
task
a
little
less
certain
of
success
than
she
had
been
but
no
less
persevering
the
work
was
agreeable
to
her
she
loved
to
embroider
and
the
dainty
design
and
exquisite
colouring
appealed
to
her
√¶sthetic
sense
had
it
been
only
one
centrepiece
and
had
she
not
felt
hurried
it
would
have
been
a
happy
outlook
but
as
she
carefully
matched
the
shades
of
silk
to
the
sample
piece
she
found
that
it
took
a
great
deal
of
time
to
get
the
tints
exactly
right
but
that
only
for
the
first
one
she
thought
hopefully
for
all
the
others
i
shall
know
just
which
silks
to
use
i
lay
them
in
order
so
there
be
no
doubt
about
it
her
habits
of
method
and
system
stood
her
in
good
stead
now
and
her
skeins
carefully
marked
were
laid
in
order
on
her
little
but
though
her
fingers
fairly
flew
the
pattern
progressed
slowly
she
even
allowed
herself
to
leave
long
stitches
on
the
wrong
side
a
thing
she
never
did
in
her
own
embroidery
she
tried
to
do
all
the
petals
of
one
tint
at
once
to
avoid
delay
of
changing
the
silks
she
used
every
effort
to
make
her
head
save
her
hands
but
the
result
was
that
both
head
and
hands
became
heated
and
nervous
this
wo
do
she
said
to
herself
as
the
silk
frazzled
between
her
trembling
fingers
if
i
get
nervous
i
never
accomplish
anything
she
forced
herself
to
be
calm
and
to
move
more
slowly
but
the
mental
strain
of
hurry
and
the
physical
strain
of
eyes
and
muscles
made
her
jerky
and
the
stitches
began
to
be
less
true
and
correct
i
be
sensible
she
thought
i
take
ten
minutes
off
and
relax
she
went
downstairs
singing
and
trying
to
assume
a
careless
demeanour
going
into
nan
she
said
work
going
on
finely
i
came
down
for
a
glass
of
water
and
to
rest
a
minute
any
one
been
here
no
said
nan
pleasantly
pretending
not
to
notice
patty
flushed
cheeks
and
tired
eyes
really
she
had
several
times
stolen
on
tiptoe
to
patty
door
and
anxiously
looked
at
her
bending
over
her
work
but
patty
did
know
this
and
wise
nan
concluded
the
time
to
speak
was
not
yet
no
no
one
came
in
to
disturb
you
which
is
fortunate
you
sensible
dear
to
rest
a
bit
jane
will
bring
you
some
water
polly
want
a
cracker
no
thank
you
i
not
hungry
nan
that
awfully
fine
work
yes
i
know
it
patsy
but
remember
you
do
to
do
it
give
the
thing
a
fair
trial
and
if
it
does
go
easily
give
it
up
and
try
something
else
it
goes
easily
enough
it
is
that
but
you
know
yourself
you
do
really
good
embroidery
if
you
do
it
too
rapidly
you
ca
but
you
do
such
wonderfully
perfect
work
that
i
should
think
you
could
afford
to
slight
it
a
little
and
still
have
it
better
than
other
people
nan
you
such
a
comfort
cried
patty
jumping
up
to
embrace
her
stepmother
you
always
say
just
the
very
right
thing
now
i
going
back
to
work
i
feel
all
rested
now
and
i
sure
i
can
finish
a
lot
why
nan
fairfield
for
goodness
sake
is
it
really
four
patty
had
just
noticed
the
time
and
was
aghast
two
solid
hours
she
had
worked
and
only
a
small
portion
of
one
piece
was
done
she
dreamed
the
time
had
flown
so
and
thought
it
about
three
slightly
disheartened
at
this
discovery
she
went
back
to
work
at
first
the
silks
went
smoothly
enough
then
hurry
and
close
application
brought
on
the
fidgets
again
before
five
she
had
to
turn
on
the
electric
lights
and
then
to
her
dismay
the
tints
of
the
silks
changed
and
she
could
tell
yellow
from
pink
or
green
from
gray
well
she
thought
i
work
the
they
of
one
solid
colour
and
it
straight
sailing
straight
sailing
it
was
but
very
tedious
an
untrue
stitch
spoiled
the
smooth
continuance
of
the
embroidery
that
was
to
represent
tied
ribbon
bows
an
untrue
stitch
and
she
made
several
had
to
be
picked
out
and
done
over
and
this
often
meant
frayed
silk
or
an
unsightly
needle
hole
in
the
linen
long
before
patty
thought
it
was
time
the
for
dinner
sounded
she
jumped
greatly
surprised
at
the
flight
of
time
but
also
relieved
that
now
she
lay
aside
her
work
she
longed
to
throw
herself
down
on
her
couch
and
rest
but
there
was
no
time
for
that
however
after
she
bathed
and
dressed
she
felt
refreshed
and
it
was
a
bright
patty
who
danced
downstairs
to
greet
her
father
if
he
thought
her
cheeks
unusually
pink
or
her
eyes
nervously
bright
he
made
no
allusion
to
it
well
puss
how
goes
the
he
said
patting
her
shoulder
it
progressing
father
she
replied
but
if
you
just
as
leave
we
wo
talk
about
it
i
tell
you
all
about
it
after
i
finish
it
all
right
pattykins
we
business
people
never
like
to
shop
and
then
fairfield
who
had
been
somewhat
enlightened
by
nan
as
to
how
matters
stood
chatted
gaily
of
other
things
and
patty
forgot
her
troublesome
work
and
was
quite
her
own
gay
saucy
self
again
kenneth
dropped
in
in
the
evening
to
bring
a
song
which
he
had
promised
patty
they
tried
it
over
together
and
then
patty
said
would
you
mind
ken
if
i
ask
you
not
to
stay
any
longer
something
i
want
to
do
and
mind
of
course
not
i
rather
fancy
we
good
enough
friends
not
to
misunderstand
each
other
if
you
let
me
come
and
make
up
my
time
some
other
night
i
skip
out
now
so
quick
you
ca
see
me
fly
all
right
said
patty
smiling
at
his
hearty
chummy
manner
i
do
wish
you
would
i
not
often
busy
as
you
know
i
know
it
lady
i
going
to
leave
you
now
and
with
a
hearty
handshake
and
a
merry
smile
kenneth
went
away
and
patty
went
to
her
own
room
i
can
work
on
that
part
she
said
to
herself
and
then
i
get
up
early
and
do
the
rest
of
the
flowers
before
breakfast
her
task
had
begun
to
look
hopeless
but
she
was
not
yet
ready
to
admit
it
and
she
assured
herself
that
of
course
the
others
would
go
much
more
rapidly
than
the
first
she
took
down
her
hair
and
braided
it
into
a
long
pigtail
then
she
put
on
a
comfortable
kimono
and
sat
down
to
work
she
stitched
and
she
stitched
and
she
stitched
at
the
monotonous
over
and
over
doggedly
she
kept
on
though
her
shoulders
ached
her
eyes
smarted
and
her
fingers
trembled
with
a
kind
of
whimsical
pathos
she
repeated
to
herself
hood
song
of
the
shirt
and
said
under
her
breath
stitch
stitch
till
the
cock
is
crowing
aloof
or
whatever
it
is
then
she
saw
by
her
watch
that
it
was
eleven
i
just
finish
this
bow
she
thought
and
then
i
stop
but
before
the
bow
was
finished
there
was
a
tap
at
her
door
who
there
said
patty
in
a
voice
which
carried
no
invitation
to
enter
it
us
said
nan
firmly
if
ungrammatically
and
we
coming
in
and
fairfield
entered
and
patty
trying
to
make
the
best
of
it
looked
up
and
smiled
how
do
you
do
she
said
take
seats
wo
you
i
just
amusing
myself
you
see
but
the
tired
voice
had
a
quiver
in
it
for
all
at
once
patty
saw
that
she
had
failed
she
had
worked
hard
all
the
afternoon
and
evening
and
had
not
finished
one
of
her
pieces
it
was
this
discovery
that
upset
her
rather
than
the
unexpected
visit
from
her
parents
girlie
this
wo
do
began
her
father
in
his
kindest
tones
i
know
it
cried
patty
throwing
down
her
work
and
flinging
herself
into
her
father
arms
i
ca
do
it
daddy
i
ca
i
have
done
one
yet
and
i
never
can
do
exclaimed
nan
patty
are
you
crazy
i
think
i
must
have
been
said
patty
laughing
a
little
hysterically
as
she
took
the
great
pile
of
centrepieces
from
a
wardrobe
and
threw
them
into
nan
lap
but
but
you
said
a
dozen
said
nan
bewildered
oh
no
i
did
returned
patty
said
did
i
bring
a
dozen
and
i
said
yes
also
i
brought
two
dozen
more
to
do
in
a
week
said
nan
in
an
awe
struck
voice
yes
to
do
in
a
week
said
patty
mimicking
nan
tones
and
then
they
both
laughed
but
fairfield
did
laugh
his
limited
knowledge
of
embroidery
made
him
ignorant
of
how
much
work
three
dozen
might
mean
but
he
knew
the
effect
it
had
already
had
on
patty
and
he
knew
it
was
time
to
interfere
my
child
he
began
but
patty
interrupted
him
do
waste
words
daddy
dear
she
said
it
all
over
i
tried
and
failed
but
remember
this
is
only
my
first
attempt
the
fact
that
she
realised
her
failure
was
in
a
way
a
relief
for
the
strain
of
effort
was
over
and
she
could
now
see
the
absurdity
of
the
task
she
had
undertaken
she
had
reached
what
some
one
has
called
the
peace
of
defeat
and
her
spirits
reacted
as
after
an
escape
from
peril
i
must
have
been
crazy
nan
she
said
sitting
down
beside
her
on
the
couch
just
think
i
worked
about
six
hours
and
i
done
about
half
of
one
piece
and
i
brought
this
statement
of
the
case
gave
fairfield
a
clearer
idea
and
he
laughed
too
no
patty
i
think
i
need
say
nothing
more
i
see
you
know
when
beaten
and
i
fancy
you
wo
touch
needle
to
that
pile
of
work
again
i
hope
you
can
settle
matters
with
your
if
not
i
help
you
out
but
i
want
to
congratulate
you
on
your
pluck
and
perseverance
even
if
well
even
if
they
were
crazy
supplemented
patty
chapter
ix
slips
and
sleeves
the
next
morning
nan
went
with
patty
to
take
the
centrepieces
back
to
the
embroidery
company
i
shall
really
like
to
see
that
woman
said
nan
as
they
reached
the
shop
i
sorry
for
her
said
patty
she
so
pathetically
weary
and
so
she
was
and
when
nan
saw
her
she
felt
sorry
for
her
too
could
work
as
fast
as
you
thought
she
said
to
patty
not
unkindly
but
with
the
hard
smile
that
seemed
to
be
permanently
fastened
to
her
face
no
i
could
confessed
patty
i
only
worked
part
of
one
piece
brought
all
the
rest
back
in
good
order
and
i
want
you
to
redeem
them
in
her
mechanical
way
the
woman
took
the
untouched
centrepieces
looked
at
them
critically
and
laid
them
aside
then
she
took
up
the
piece
patty
had
worked
on
i
have
to
deduct
for
this
she
said
a
dollar
and
a
half
what
do
you
mean
asked
nan
angry
at
what
she
considered
gross
injustice
miss
fairfield
does
not
ask
payment
she
is
giving
you
all
that
work
she
has
spoiled
this
piece
for
our
use
she
works
nicely
enough
but
no
two
people
work
exactly
alike
so
no
one
else
could
now
take
this
and
complete
the
corner
so
you
see
the
piece
is
valueless
and
we
must
charge
for
it
moreover
i
should
have
to
deduct
fifty
cents
if
it
had
been
finished
because
long
stitches
show
on
the
wrong
side
and
you
do
allow
that
said
nan
never
we
deduct
for
that
or
for
soiling
the
work
or
for
using
wrong
colours
well
said
patty
return
me
as
much
of
my
deposit
as
is
due
me
and
we
consider
the
incident
closed
stolidly
the
woman
opened
a
drawer
counted
out
sixteen
dollars
and
a
half
and
gave
it
to
patty
who
said
and
stalked
out
of
the
shop
nan
followed
and
when
they
were
seated
in
the
both
broke
into
peals
of
laughter
oh
patty
cried
nan
what
a
financier
you
are
you
nearly
killed
yourself
working
yesterday
and
now
you
paid
a
dollar
and
a
half
for
the
privilege
pooh
said
patty
nothing
of
the
sort
i
paid
a
dollar
and
a
half
for
some
valuable
experience
and
i
think
i
got
it
cheap
enough
yes
i
suppose
you
did
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
next
for
i
know
you
well
enough
to
know
you
not
going
to
give
up
your
scheme
entirely
indeed
i
not
but
i
going
to
frivol
i
worked
hard
enough
yesterday
to
deserve
a
rest
and
i
going
to
take
it
come
on
let
go
somewhere
nice
to
luncheon
and
then
go
to
a
matin√©e
it
wednesday
very
well
i
think
you
do
need
recreation
i
take
you
to
cherry
for
luncheon
and
then
we
go
to
see
a
comic
opera
or
some
light
comedy
you
a
great
comfort
nan
said
patty
you
always
do
just
the
right
thing
but
you
need
think
you
can
divert
my
mind
to
the
extent
of
making
me
give
up
this
plan
of
mine
for
i
wo
do
that
i
know
you
wo
but
next
time
do
try
something
easier
i
shall
i
already
made
up
my
mind
what
it
to
be
and
truly
dead
easy
i
thought
your
friend
cured
you
of
using
slang
said
nan
smiling
i
thought
so
too
said
patty
with
an
air
of
innocent
surprise
it
queer
how
one
can
be
mistaken
true
to
her
determination
patty
started
out
again
the
following
morning
to
get
an
occupation
as
they
all
termed
it
again
miller
was
amazed
at
the
address
given
him
but
he
said
nothing
and
proceeded
to
drive
patty
to
it
it
was
even
less
attractive
than
the
former
shop
being
nothing
more
or
less
than
an
establishment
where
white
work
was
given
out
how
many
asked
the
woman
in
charge
and
profiting
by
past
experience
patty
said
one
dozen
the
woman
took
her
name
and
address
in
a
quick
way
one
dollar
a
dozen
she
said
must
be
returned
within
the
week
deductions
made
for
all
imperfections
she
handed
patty
a
large
bundle
done
up
in
newspaper
and
with
flaming
cheeks
patty
walked
out
of
the
shop
home
miller
she
said
and
though
the
man
was
too
well
trained
to
look
surprised
he
could
keep
an
expression
of
astonishment
out
of
his
eyes
when
he
saw
patty
burden
on
the
way
home
she
opened
the
parcel
there
were
in
it
twelve
infants
slips
of
rather
coarse
muslin
they
were
cut
out
but
not
basted
patty
looked
a
little
doubtful
then
she
thought
oh
pshaw
it
very
different
from
that
fine
embroidery
i
can
swish
these
through
the
in
no
time
at
all
reaching
home
she
threw
the
over
her
bundle
and
hurried
into
the
house
with
it
patty
called
nan
as
she
whisked
upstairs
to
her
own
room
come
here
wo
you
yes
in
a
minute
patty
called
back
flying
on
upstairs
and
depositing
the
bundle
in
a
wardrobe
she
locked
the
door
and
hid
the
key
then
went
demurely
downstairs
occupation
all
right
asked
nan
smiling
yes
said
patty
jauntily
good
work
this
time
not
so
fine
and
fussy
well
i
only
wanted
to
tell
you
that
elise
telephoned
and
wants
you
to
go
to
a
concert
with
her
this
afternoon
i
forget
where
it
is
she
said
for
you
to
call
her
up
as
soon
as
you
came
home
all
right
i
will
said
patty
and
she
went
to
the
telephone
at
once
it
a
lovely
concert
nan
she
said
as
she
returned
jigamarigski
is
going
to
sing
and
afterward
i
to
go
home
with
elise
to
dinner
and
they
bring
me
home
what
shall
i
wear
wear
your
light
green
cloth
suit
and
your
furs
said
nan
after
a
moment
consideration
and
your
big
white
beaver
hat
it
too
dressy
an
affair
for
your
black
hat
apparently
the
occupation
was
forgotten
for
during
luncheon
time
patty
chatted
about
the
concert
and
other
matters
and
at
two
she
went
away
you
look
lovely
said
nan
as
in
her
pretty
cloth
suit
and
white
hat
and
furs
patty
came
to
say
the
concert
proved
most
enjoyable
dinner
at
the
farringtons
was
equally
so
and
when
patty
reached
home
at
about
nine
she
had
much
to
tell
nan
and
her
father
who
were
always
glad
to
hear
of
her
social
pleasures
and
the
occupation
asked
fairfield
how
is
it
progressing
nicely
thank
you
returned
patty
i
picked
an
easy
one
this
time
one
has
to
learn
you
know
smiling
she
went
to
her
room
that
night
determined
to
attack
the
work
next
morning
and
hurry
it
through
but
next
morning
came
a
note
from
clementine
asking
patty
to
go
to
the
photographer
with
her
at
ten
and
as
patty
had
promised
to
do
this
when
called
on
she
did
like
to
refuse
and
anyway
she
thought
a
week
is
a
week
whatever
day
i
begin
this
new
work
i
shall
have
a
week
from
that
day
to
earn
the
fifteen
dollars
in
then
that
afternoon
was
so
fine
she
went
for
a
with
nan
and
the
next
day
some
guests
came
to
luncheon
and
naturally
patty
could
absent
herself
without
explanation
and
then
came
sunday
and
so
it
was
monday
morning
before
patty
began
her
new
work
excuse
me
to
any
one
who
comes
nan
she
said
as
she
left
the
breakfast
table
i
have
to
work
and
i
must
be
interrupted
very
well
said
nan
i
think
myself
it
time
you
began
if
going
to
accomplish
anything
armed
with
her
pile
of
work
and
her
basket
of
sewing
materials
patty
went
up
to
the
fourth
floor
where
a
small
room
was
set
apart
as
a
it
was
rarely
used
save
by
the
maids
for
nan
was
not
fond
of
sewing
but
there
was
a
good
there
and
ample
light
and
space
full
of
enthusiasm
patty
seated
herself
at
the
and
picked
up
the
work
i
be
very
systematic
she
thought
i
do
all
the
side
seams
first
then
all
the
hems
then
i
stitch
up
all
the
little
sleeves
at
once
the
plan
worked
well
the
simple
little
garments
had
but
two
seams
and
setting
the
machine
stitch
rather
long
patty
whizzed
the
little
white
slips
through
one
after
the
other
singing
in
time
to
her
treadle
oh
it
too
easy
she
thought
as
in
a
short
time
the
seams
were
neatly
stitched
now
for
the
hems
these
were
a
little
more
troublesome
as
they
had
to
be
folded
and
basted
but
still
it
was
an
easy
task
and
patty
worked
away
like
a
busy
bee
now
for
the
babykins
sleeves
she
said
but
just
then
the
luncheon
gong
sounded
not
really
cried
patty
aloud
as
she
glanced
at
her
watch
but
in
very
truth
it
was
one
and
it
was
a
thoughtful
patty
who
walked
slowly
downstairs
nan
she
exclaimed
the
trouble
with
an
occupation
is
that
not
time
enough
in
a
day
or
a
to
do
anything
nan
nodded
her
head
sagaciously
i
always
noticed
that
she
said
it
only
when
you
playing
that
there
any
time
if
you
try
to
work
there
no
time
at
all
not
a
bit
echoed
patty
and
what
there
is
glides
through
your
fingers
before
you
know
it
she
hurried
through
her
luncheon
and
returned
to
the
she
was
not
tired
but
there
was
a
great
deal
yet
to
do
the
tiny
sleeves
she
put
through
the
machine
one
after
another
until
she
had
in
a
long
chain
linked
by
a
single
stitch
oh
method
and
system
accomplish
wonders
she
thought
as
she
snipped
the
sleeves
apart
and
rapidly
folded
hems
round
the
little
wrists
but
even
with
method
and
system
is
a
large
number
and
as
patty
turned
the
last
hem
twilight
fell
and
she
turned
on
the
lights
goodness
gracious
she
thought
i
yet
all
these
sleeves
to
set
and
stitch
in
and
the
fronts
to
finish
off
and
a
buttonhole
to
work
in
each
neckband
but
it
was
only
four
and
by
six
they
were
all
finished
but
the
buttonholes
and
patty
was
nearly
finished
too
she
had
not
realised
how
physically
tired
she
was
running
the
all
day
was
an
unusual
exertion
and
when
she
reached
her
own
room
with
her
arms
full
of
the
little
white
garments
she
threw
them
on
the
bed
and
threw
herself
on
the
couch
weary
in
every
bone
and
muscle
well
what
luck
said
nan
appearing
at
patty
doorway
herself
all
dressed
for
dinner
oh
nan
cried
patty
laughing
me
legs
is
broke
and
me
arms
is
broke
and
me
back
is
broke
but
i
not
nervous
or
worried
and
going
to
win
out
this
time
but
nan
i
just
go
down
to
dinner
send
jane
up
with
a
tray
there
a
dear
and
tell
father
i
all
right
but
i
do
care
to
mingle
in
society
well
i
glad
you
in
good
spirits
said
nan
half
annoyed
half
laughing
as
she
saw
the
pile
of
white
work
on
the
bed
run
along
nan
there
a
good
lady
said
patty
jumping
up
and
urging
nan
out
the
door
before
father
comes
up
to
learn
the
latest
news
from
the
seat
of
war
tell
him
everything
is
all
right
and
i
earning
my
living
with
neatness
and
despatch
only
working
girls
simply
ca
get
into
chiffons
and
dine
with
the
reassured
by
patty
gay
air
nan
went
downstairs
laughing
and
told
her
husband
that
she
believed
patty
would
yet
accomplish
her
project
these
experiences
will
do
her
no
harm
said
fairfield
after
hearing
nan
story
so
long
as
she
does
get
nervous
or
mentally
upset
we
let
her
go
on
with
her
experiment
she
a
peculiar
nature
and
has
a
wonderful
amount
of
for
one
so
young
i
always
heard
you
were
called
stubborn
said
nan
smiling
though
i
never
seen
it
specially
exemplified
in
your
case
one
does
need
to
be
stubborn
with
such
an
angelic
disposition
as
yours
in
the
house
he
returned
and
nan
smiled
happily
for
she
knew
the
words
were
lovingly
in
earnest
meantime
patty
was
sitting
luxuriously
in
a
big
eating
her
dinner
from
the
tray
jane
had
brought
her
this
is
rather
fun
she
thought
and
my
but
running
a
does
give
one
an
appetite
i
could
eat
two
i
verily
believe
thank
goodness
i
no
more
stitching
to
do
having
despatched
her
dinner
perhaps
a
trifle
hastily
patty
reluctantly
left
her
big
for
a
small
rocker
by
the
she
wearily
picked
up
a
little
gown
cut
a
buttonhole
at
the
throat
and
proceeded
to
work
it
as
she
was
so
skilful
at
embroidery
of
course
this
was
easy
work
but
patty
was
tired
and
her
fingers
almost
refused
to
push
the
needle
through
the
cloth
about
ten
nan
came
upstairs
patty
was
just
sewing
on
the
last
button
the
buttonholes
being
all
done
this
fact
made
her
jubilant
nan
she
cried
what
you
think
i
made
a
whole
dozen
of
these
patty
you
do
mean
it
why
my
dear
child
how
could
you
on
the
machine
and
they
done
neatly
are
they
yes
they
are
indeed
but
patty
what
i
hate
to
tell
you
but
oh
what
is
it
nan
is
the
material
wrong
side
out
no
you
goosie
there
no
right
or
wrong
side
to
cotton
cloth
but
well
tell
me
every
one
of
these
little
sleeves
is
made
upside
down
oh
nan
it
ca
be
yes
they
are
dearie
see
this
wider
part
should
have
been
at
the
top
oh
nan
what
shall
i
do
i
thought
they
were
sort
of
flowing
sleeves
you
know
ones
i
mean
no
they
set
wrong
oh
patty
why
did
you
let
me
help
you
but
you
told
me
to
keep
away
yes
i
know
i
did
now
i
spoiled
the
whole
dozen
i
like
them
just
as
well
that
way
myself
but
i
know
they
for
it
patty
i
do
think
you
ought
to
do
work
anyway
how
much
are
they
going
to
pay
you
a
dollar
a
dozen
and
you
done
a
dozen
in
a
day
that
wo
bring
you
fifteen
dollars
in
a
week
well
i
thought
the
second
dozen
would
go
faster
and
it
probably
will
and
of
course
i
sha
make
that
mistake
with
the
sleeves
again
truly
nan
it
a
heap
easier
than
embroidery
well
do
worry
over
it
said
nan
kissing
her
take
a
hot
bath
and
hop
into
bed
perhaps
you
have
found
the
right
work
after
all
nan
did
really
think
she
had
but
patty
had
begun
to
look
worried
and
nan
feared
she
would
be
able
to
sleep
but
sleep
she
did
from
sheer
physical
exhaustion
and
woke
next
morning
almost
unable
to
move
every
muscle
in
her
body
was
lame
from
her
strenuous
machine
work
she
could
rise
from
her
bed
and
could
scarcely
raise
her
head
from
the
pillow
when
catherine
nan
maid
came
to
her
room
patty
said
faintly
ask
fairfield
to
come
up
please
nan
came
and
patty
looked
at
her
comically
as
she
said
nan
i
vanquished
but
not
subdued
i
just
one
mass
of
lameness
and
ache
but
if
you
think
i
given
up
my
plan
you
greatly
mistaken
however
i
through
with
work
and
i
sewed
my
last
sew
on
a
machine
why
patty
girl
you
really
ill
said
nan
sympathetically
no
i
not
i
perfectly
well
just
a
trifle
lame
from
yesterday
i
stay
in
bed
and
nan
dear
if
you
love
me
take
those
slips
back
to
the
kind
lady
who
let
me
have
them
to
play
with
make
her
pay
you
a
dollar
for
the
dozen
and
do
let
her
deduct
more
than
a
dollar
for
the
of
the
sleeves
tell
her
they
prettier
that
way
anyway
and
catharine
do
please
rub
me
with
some
healing
lotion
or
something
for
i
as
lame
as
a
patty
said
nan
solemnly
the
occasion
requires
strong
language
so
i
will
remark
in
all
seriousness
that
you
do
beat
all
chapter
x
the
clever
goldfish
financially
patty
came
out
just
even
on
her
work
for
though
the
woman
paid
nan
the
dollar
for
the
dozen
finished
garments
she
deducted
the
same
amount
for
the
wrongly
placed
sleeves
she
also
grumbled
at
the
long
machine
stitch
patty
had
used
but
patience
was
exhausted
and
giving
the
woman
a
calm
stare
she
walked
out
of
the
shop
it
perfectly
awful
she
said
to
patty
when
relating
her
adventure
to
think
of
the
poor
girls
who
are
really
trying
to
earn
their
living
by
white
work
it
all
very
well
for
you
who
are
only
experimenting
but
suppose
a
real
worker
gets
all
her
pay
deducted
there
hardly
enough
pay
to
pay
for
deducting
it
anyway
said
patty
oh
nan
it
is
dreadful
i
suppose
lots
of
poor
girls
who
feel
as
tired
and
lame
as
i
do
this
morning
have
to
go
straight
back
to
their
and
run
it
all
day
of
course
they
do
and
often
they
of
delicate
constitutions
and
insufficiently
nourished
it
makes
me
feel
awful
things
are
unevenly
divided
in
this
world
are
they
nan
they
are
my
dear
but
as
that
problem
has
baffled
wiser
heads
than
yours
it
useless
for
you
to
worry
over
it
you
ca
reform
the
world
no
and
i
do
intend
to
try
but
i
can
do
something
to
help
i
know
i
can
that
where
people
show
their
lack
of
a
sense
of
proportion
i
know
i
ca
do
anything
for
the
world
as
a
world
but
if
i
can
help
in
a
few
individual
cases
that
will
be
my
share
for
instance
if
i
can
help
this
christine
farley
to
an
art
education
and
so
to
a
successful
career
why
that
so
much
to
the
good
and
though
father
has
set
me
a
hard
task
to
bring
it
about
i
going
to
do
it
yet
your
father
would
have
set
you
such
a
task
if
you
had
declared
it
was
no
task
at
all
you
said
you
could
earn
your
living
easily
in
a
dozen
different
ways
already
you
discarded
two
that
leaves
me
ten
said
patty
airily
ten
ways
of
earning
a
living
is
a
fair
show
i
can
discard
nine
more
and
still
have
a
chance
all
right
patsy
i
glad
you
not
disheartened
and
i
suppose
you
are
learning
something
of
the
conditions
of
our
social
economy
gracious
nan
how
you
talk
are
you
quite
sure
you
know
what
you
mean
no
but
i
thought
you
would
said
nan
and
with
that
parting
shot
she
left
the
room
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
before
patty
dawdled
downstairs
her
shoulders
and
the
back
of
her
neck
still
ached
but
otherwise
she
felt
all
right
again
and
her
spirits
had
risen
proportionately
about
four
kenneth
called
bringing
a
mysterious
burden
which
he
carried
with
great
care
he
knew
of
patty
scheme
and
though
he
appreciated
the
nobility
of
her
endeavour
he
could
not
feel
very
sanguine
hopes
of
her
success
you
not
cut
out
for
a
patty
he
had
said
to
her
like
a
butterfly
making
bread
but
i
do
want
to
be
a
butterfly
patty
had
pouted
oh
i
do
mean
butterfly
as
so
many
people
do
to
represent
a
frivolous
useless
person
i
have
a
great
respect
for
butterflies
myself
and
you
radiate
the
same
effect
of
joy
happiness
gladness
and
beauty
as
a
butterfly
does
when
hovering
around
in
the
golden
sunshine
of
a
summer
day
why
ken
i
did
know
you
were
a
poet
but
you
have
proved
your
case
yes
i
have
it
your
mission
in
life
to
be
happy
and
so
to
make
others
happy
this
you
can
do
without
definite
effort
so
stick
to
your
calling
and
let
the
more
prosaic
people
the
plodders
earn
wages
let
me
earn
the
wages
of
my
country
and
i
care
not
who
makes
it
smile
patty
had
rejoined
and
there
the
subject
had
dropped
when
he
arrived
carrying
what
was
evidently
something
fragile
patty
greeted
him
gaily
i
not
working
she
said
so
you
can
stay
an
hour
if
you
like
well
i
will
and
if
you
wait
till
i
set
down
this
precious
burden
i
shake
hands
with
you
i
come
like
the
greeks
bearing
gifts
a
gift
oh
what
is
it
i
crazy
to
see
it
well
it
a
gift
but
incidentally
it
a
plan
for
if
you
really
want
to
you
may
as
well
do
it
in
an
interesting
way
yes
said
patty
demurely
for
she
well
knew
he
was
up
to
some
sort
of
foolery
my
attempts
so
far
though
absorbing
were
not
really
interesting
well
this
is
declared
kenneth
who
was
carefully
taking
the
tissue
papers
from
his
gift
which
proved
to
be
a
glass
globe
containing
two
goldfish
they
are
darby
and
juliet
he
remarked
as
he
looked
anxiously
into
the
bowl
i
am
so
tired
of
hackneyed
pairs
of
names
that
i
varied
these
but
wo
you
send
for
some
more
water
i
had
to
bring
them
with
only
a
little
for
fear
i
spill
it
and
they
seem
to
have
drunk
it
nearly
all
up
nonsense
they
do
drink
the
water
they
only
swim
in
it
that
the
trouble
there
is
enough
for
them
to
swim
in
and
yet
there
too
much
for
them
to
drink
patty
rang
for
jane
who
then
brought
them
a
pitcher
of
ice
water
kenneth
poured
it
in
but
at
the
sudden
cold
deluge
darby
and
juliet
began
to
behave
in
an
extraordinary
manner
they
flew
madly
round
and
round
the
bowl
hitting
each
other
and
breathing
in
gasps
the
water
too
cold
cried
patty
of
course
it
is
said
kenneth
get
some
hot
water
wo
you
patty
ran
herself
for
the
hot
water
and
returned
with
a
pitcher
full
do
you
want
a
little
mustard
she
said
giggling
i
know
taken
cold
a
hot
mustard
is
fine
for
colds
and
that
is
very
odd
because
they
have
any
feet
quoted
kenneth
as
he
poured
the
hot
water
in
very
slowly
do
you
want
a
bath
thermometer
went
on
patty
no
when
they
stop
wriggling
it
warm
enough
there
now
they
all
right
kenneth
set
down
the
hot
water
pitcher
and
looked
with
pride
on
the
two
fish
who
had
certainly
stopped
wriggling
they
awful
quiet
said
patty
are
you
sure
they
all
right
i
think
you
boiled
them
nothing
of
the
sort
they
like
warmth
only
it
makes
them
sort
of
dormant
suggested
patty
yes
clever
child
dormant
and
now
while
they
sleep
i
tell
you
my
plan
you
see
these
are
extra
intelligent
goldfish
especially
juliet
the
one
with
a
black
spot
on
her
shoulder
well
you
only
to
train
them
a
bit
and
then
give
exhibitions
of
your
trained
goldfish
you
no
idea
what
a
hit
it
will
make
kenneth
you
a
genius
cried
patty
meeting
his
fun
halfway
lots
easier
than
white
work
come
on
help
me
train
them
wo
you
how
do
we
begin
they
still
sleepy
said
kenneth
looking
at
the
inert
fish
they
need
stirring
up
i
get
a
spoon
said
patty
promptly
no
just
waggle
the
water
with
your
finger
they
come
up
patty
waggled
the
water
with
her
finger
but
darby
only
blinked
at
her
while
juliet
flounced
petulantly
she
observed
kenneth
and
a
trifle
but
she
wo
stand
scolding
let
take
her
out
and
pet
her
a
little
how
do
you
get
her
out
with
a
hook
and
line
no
silly
you
must
be
kind
to
them
here
puss
puss
puss
come
come
but
juliet
haughtily
ignored
the
invitation
and
huddled
in
the
bottom
of
the
bowl
try
this
said
patty
running
to
the
and
returning
with
a
silver
fish
server
this
worked
beautifully
and
kenneth
scooped
up
juliet
who
lay
quietly
on
the
broad
silver
blade
blinking
at
them
reproachfully
she
hungry
ken
see
how
she
opens
and
shuts
her
mouth
no
she
trying
to
talk
i
told
you
she
was
clever
i
daresay
you
can
teach
her
to
sing
she
looks
just
as
you
do
when
you
take
a
high
note
you
horrid
boy
but
she
does
really
anyway
let
feed
them
what
do
they
eat
i
brought
their
food
with
me
it
some
patent
stuff
very
well
advertised
here
julie
gently
slipping
juliet
back
into
the
water
ken
scattered
some
food
on
the
surface
both
fish
rose
to
the
occasion
and
greedily
ate
the
floating
particles
that
the
trouble
said
ken
they
have
no
judgment
they
overeat
and
then
they
die
of
apoplexy
and
too
if
they
eat
too
much
you
train
them
to
stand
on
their
tails
and
beg
oh
will
they
learn
to
do
that
and
what
else
can
we
teach
them
oh
anything
acrobatic
trapeze
work
and
that
but
they
sleepy
now
you
fed
them
too
much
for
just
an
afternoon
tea
let
leave
them
to
their
nap
and
train
them
after
they
wake
up
all
right
let
sit
down
and
talk
seriously
patty
you
always
ready
to
talk
seriously
of
late
that
why
i
brought
you
some
nonsense
fish
to
lighten
your
mood
a
little
do
you
worry
about
my
mood
ken
it
light
enough
but
i
want
you
to
help
me
earn
my
living
for
a
week
will
you
that
i
will
not
i
be
no
party
to
your
foolishness
now
ken
went
on
patty
for
she
knew
his
bark
was
worse
than
his
bite
i
do
want
you
to
do
anything
much
but
in
your
law
office
where
you
studying
are
there
some
papers
i
can
copy
or
something
like
that
patty
you
a
back
number
that
that
you
mean
is
all
out
of
date
in
these
days
of
typewriters
and
manifold
thigamajigs
we
lawyers
do
have
much
copying
done
by
hand
except
perhaps
engrossing
can
you
do
that
how
prettily
you
say
lawyers
teased
patty
of
course
i
do
i
getting
in
practice
against
the
time
it
be
true
but
if
you
really
want
to
copy
buy
a
nice
spencerian
and
fill
up
its
pages
it
be
about
as
valuable
as
any
other
work
of
the
sort
ken
you
horrid
so
unsympathetic
i
crool
only
to
be
kind
you
must
know
patty
that
copying
is
out
of
the
question
well
never
mind
then
let
talk
of
something
else
sit
upon
the
ground
and
tell
strange
stories
of
the
death
of
kings
oh
ken
that
reminds
me
you
know
my
crystal
ball
i
do
indeed
i
selected
it
with
utmost
care
yes
it
a
gem
perfectly
flawless
well
i
get
it
and
see
if
we
can
see
things
in
it
patty
ran
for
her
crystal
and
returning
to
the
library
held
it
up
to
the
fading
sunlight
and
tried
to
look
into
it
that
is
the
way
patty
you
have
to
lay
it
on
black
velvet
or
something
dark
oh
do
you
well
here
a
dark
mat
on
this
table
try
that
they
gazed
intently
into
the
ball
and
though
they
could
see
nothing
patty
felt
a
weird
sense
of
uncanniness
ken
laughed
when
she
declared
this
and
said
nothing
in
the
world
but
suggestion
you
think
a
japanese
crystal
to
make
you
feel
supernatural
and
so
you
imagine
it
does
but
it
does
any
such
nonsense
now
i
tell
you
why
i
like
them
only
because
they
so
flawlessly
perfect
in
shape
colour
texture
if
you
can
call
it
texture
but
i
mean
material
or
substance
there
is
an
attribute
that
they
possess
except
in
perfection
that
a
great
thing
patty
and
you
ca
say
it
of
anything
else
the
stars
said
patty
trying
to
look
wise
oh
pshaw
i
mean
things
made
by
man
great
pictures
she
suggested
their
perfection
is
a
matter
of
opinion
one
man
deems
a
picture
perfect
another
man
does
not
but
a
crystal
ball
is
indubitably
perfect
indubitably
is
an
awful
big
word
said
patty
i
afraid
of
it
never
mind
said
kenneth
kindly
i
wo
let
it
hurt
you
then
the
doorbell
rang
and
in
a
moment
in
came
elise
and
roger
hello
ken
said
elise
we
came
for
patty
to
go
skating
will
you
go
too
i
ca

said
patty
i
too
tired
and
it
too
late
anyway
you
stay
here
and
we
have
tea
all
right
i
do
care
said
elise
taking
off
her
furs
the
quartette
gathered
round
the
library
fire
and
jane
brought
in
the
tea
things
patty
made
tea
very
prettily
for
she
excelled
in
domestic
accomplishments
and
as
she
handed
kenneth
his
cup
she
said
roguishly
there
a
perfect
cup
of
tea
i
can
assure
you
perfect
tea
all
right
returned
ken
sipping
it
but
a
cup
of
tea
ca
be
a
perfect
thing
as
it
has
complete
symmetry
of
form
what
are
you
two
talking
about
demanded
elise
who
did
want
ken
and
patty
to
have
secrets
from
which
she
was
excluded
speaking
of
crystal
balls
said
patty
i
show
you
one
elise
a
big
one
too
get
darby
and
juliet
wo
you
please
ken
kenneth
obligingly
brought
the
glass
globe
in
from
the
where
they
had
left
the
goldfish
to
be
by
themselves
how
jolly
cried
elise
and
what
lovely
goldfish
these
are
the
real
japanese
ones
are
they
yes
said
patty
smiling
at
ken
being
japanese
they
perfect
of
their
kind
make
them
stand
on
their
tails
and
beg
kenneth
oh
will
they
do
that
said
elise
only
on
wednesdays
and
saturdays
said
kenneth
gravely
and
on
fridays
they
sing
is
their
rest
day
they
look
morbid
said
roger
shall
i
jolly
them
up
a
bit
let
give
them
tea
said
elise
tilting
her
spoon
until
a
few
drops
fell
into
the
water
you
make
them
nervous
warned
patty
and
juliet
is
anyway
then
nan
came
in
from
her
afternoon
round
of
calls
and
then
fairfield
arrived
and
they
too
were
called
upon
to
make
friends
with
darby
and
juliet
goldfish
always
make
me
think
of
a
story
about
whistler
said
fairfield
it
seems
whistler
once
had
a
room
in
a
house
in
florence
directly
over
a
person
who
had
some
pet
goldfish
in
a
bowl
every
pleasant
day
the
bowl
was
set
out
on
the
balcony
which
was
exactly
beneath
whistler
balcony
for
days
he
resisted
the
temptation
to
fish
for
them
with
a
bent
pin
and
a
string
but
at
last
he
succumbed
to
his
angling
instincts
and
caught
them
all
then
remorseful
at
what
he
had
done
he
fried
them
to
a
fine
golden
brown
and
returned
them
to
their
owner
on
a
platter
ugh
cried
nan
what
a
horrid
story
why
do
they
always
tack
unpleasant
stories
on
poor
old
whistler
now
i
know
a
lovely
story
about
a
goldfish
which
i
will
relate
it
is
said
to
be
the
composition
of
a
small
boston
schoolchild
robin
lovely
goldfish
who
teached
you
how
to
fly
who
sticked
the
fur
upon
your
breast
was
god
was
god
what
done
it
is
that
lovely
it
is
indeed
agreed
kenneth
if
that
boston
precocity
it
more
attractive
than
i
thought
but
it
does
rhyme
said
elise
no
said
patty
that
the
beauty
of
it
it
blank
verse
as
the
greatest
poetry
often
is
do
go
yet
elise
stay
to
dinner
you
no
i
ca
stay
patty
dear
will
you
go
skating
patty
hesitated
she
wanted
to
go
but
also
she
wanted
to
get
at
that
occupation
of
hers
for
she
had
a
new
one
in
view
she
was
about
to
say
she
would
go
skating
however
when
she
saw
a
twinkle
in
her
father
eye
that
made
her
change
her
mind
ca
elise
she
said
i
an
engagement
will
telephone
you
some
day
when
i
can
go
well
do
wait
too
long
the
ice
will
be
all
gone
then
the
young
people
went
away
and
patty
went
thoughtfully
upstairs
to
her
room
to
dress
for
dinner
chapter
xi
a
busy
morning
the
next
morning
patty
came
down
to
breakfast
wearing
a
plain
street
costume
a
small
but
very
well
made
hat
and
a
look
of
determination
fresh
start
said
her
father
smiling
kindly
at
her
yes
she
replied
and
this
time
i
conquer
i
see
success
already
perching
on
my
banners
well
i
do
then
declared
nan
i
see
you
coming
home
not
with
your
shield
but
on
it
now
do
be
a
wet
blanket
and
throw
cold
water
on
my
plans
said
patty
a
little
mixed
in
her
metaphor
but
smiling
placidly
at
her
stepmother
this
time
it
really
a
most
sensible
undertaking
that
going
to
undertake
sounds
as
if
you
were
going
into
the
undertaking
business
said
her
father
but
i
assume
you
do
mean
that
no
i
go
into
a
pleasanter
atmosphere
than
that
suggests
and
one
in
which
i
feel
sure
i
can
accomplish
good
work
well
patty
said
fairfield
it
lucky
you
of
a
sanguine
temperament
i
glad
to
see
you
not
disheartened
by
failure
not
i
to
me
a
failure
only
means
a
more
vigorous
attempt
next
time
now
nan
i
shall
be
away
all
day
until
about
five
wo
you
play
with
darby
and
juliet
a
little
so
they
wo
get
lonesome
oh
yes
i
amuse
them
but
patty
where
are
you
going
never
mind
pretty
stepmothery
do
ask
questions
for
they
wo
be
answered
if
all
goes
well
i
tell
you
on
my
return
fairfield
looked
serious
patty
he
said
you
know
you
not
to
do
anything
unbecoming
or
ridiculous
do
you
go
and
sell
goods
behind
a
counter
or
anything
extreme
like
that
no
sir
i
wo
i
promise
not
to
put
myself
in
the
public
eye
in
any
such
fashion
and
you
may
trust
me
father
not
to
do
anything
of
which
you
disapprove
if
you
knew
all
about
it
that
a
good
well
go
ahead
in
your
mad
career
and
if
you
keep
your
part
of
the
bargain
i
keep
mine
patty
started
off
and
this
time
she
gave
miller
an
address
not
so
far
away
as
before
when
he
brought
the
to
a
standstill
before
a
fashionable
millinery
shop
he
felt
none
of
the
surprise
that
he
had
when
he
took
patty
to
what
he
considered
inappropriate
places
now
miller
said
patty
as
she
got
out
of
the
car
you
are
not
to
wait
for
me
but
i
want
you
to
return
here
for
me
at
five
here
miss
fairfield
yes
right
here
come
exactly
at
five
and
wait
for
me
to
come
out
yes
miss
fairfield
said
miller
and
patty
turned
and
entered
the
shop
i
sorry
i
sent
him
away
she
thought
to
herself
for
i
may
not
want
to
stay
well
i
can
go
home
in
a
though
patty
costume
was
plain
and
inconspicuous
it
bore
so
evidently
the
stamp
of
taste
and
refinement
that
the
saleswoman
who
met
her
assumed
she
had
come
to
buy
a
hat
but
it
was
early
for
fashionable
ladies
to
be
out
shopping
so
the
rather
supercilious
young
woman
greeted
patty
with
a
cautious
air
of
reserve
it
was
so
different
from
the
effusive
manner
usually
shown
to
nan
and
patty
when
they
really
went
shopping
that
patty
was
secretly
much
amused
but
as
she
was
also
secretly
greatly
embarrassed
it
was
with
an
uncertain
air
that
she
said
i
am
not
shopping
i
wish
to
see
madame
villard
madame
is
not
here
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
have
come
in
answer
to
her
advertisement
for
an
assistant
milliner
oh
said
the
young
woman
raising
her
eyebrows
and
at
once
showing
an
air
of
haughty
condescension
you
should
have
asked
for
the
forewoman
not
madame
patty
sense
of
humour
got
the
better
of
her
resentment
and
it
was
with
difficulty
she
repressed
a
smile
as
she
answered
indeed
well
it
is
not
yet
too
late
to
correct
my
error
will
you
show
me
to
the
forewoman
patty
inflections
were
not
in
the
least
sarcastic
in
fact
her
whole
manner
was
gentle
and
gracious
but
something
in
her
tone
perhaps
the
note
of
amusement
made
the
saleswoman
look
at
her
suddenly
and
sharply
but
patty
face
was
demure
and
showed
only
a
desire
to
be
conducted
to
the
right
person
come
this
way
said
the
young
woman
shortly
and
she
led
patty
between
some
heavy
curtains
to
a
back
room
this
is
our
forewoman
miss
she
said
as
she
ushered
patty
into
her
presence
miss
was
an
important
looking
woman
who
took
in
every
detail
of
patty
appearance
in
a
series
of
careful
and
systematic
glances
she
seemed
puzzled
at
what
she
saw
and
said
inquiringly
miss
miss
fairfield
said
patty
pleasantly
and
i
have
come
in
answer
to
your
advertisement
for
assistant
milliner
you
miss
was
surprised
out
of
her
usual
calm
by
the
amazing
proposition
of
the
young
stranger
yes
said
patty
quite
calm
herself
i
can
trim
hats
very
prettily
did
you
trim
the
one
you
have
on
well
no
admitted
patty
i
brought
this
from
paris
but
i
am
sure
i
can
trim
hats
to
suit
you
may
i
try
what
experience
have
you
had
well
not
any
professional
experience
you
see
it
is
only
recently
that
i
have
desired
to
earn
my
own
living
oh
sudden
reverses
murmured
miss
thinking
she
had
solved
the
problem
well
my
dear
you
have
evidently
been
brought
up
a
lady
so
it
will
be
hard
for
you
to
find
work
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
can
not
employ
you
as
i
engage
only
skilled
workwomen
but
trimming
hats
does
require
professional
skill
said
patty
only
good
taste
and
a
a
sort
of
knack
at
bows
and
things
miss
laughed
everything
requires
professional
skill
she
returned
a
course
of
training
is
necessary
for
any
position
but
if
you
try
me
said
patty
quite
unconscious
that
her
tone
was
pleading
just
give
me
a
day
trial
and
if
i
do
make
good
you
need
pay
me
anything
miss
was
more
puzzled
than
ever
insistent
though
patty
was
it
did
seem
to
her
the
insistence
of
a
poor
girl
wanting
to
earn
her
bread
it
was
more
like
the
determination
of
a
wilful
child
to
attain
its
desire
so
moved
rather
by
curiosity
to
see
how
it
would
turn
out
than
a
belief
in
patty
ability
she
said
coldly
i
will
do
as
you
ask
you
may
go
to
the
workroom
for
but
on
the
understanding
that
unless
you
show
unusual
skill
or
aptitude
to
learn
you
are
not
to
be
paid
anything
nor
are
you
to
come
all
right
said
patty
smiling
jubilantly
at
having
received
her
opportunity
at
least
miss
took
her
to
a
workroom
where
several
girls
were
busily
engaged
in
various
sorts
of
millinery
work
sit
here
miss
fairfield
and
miss
indicated
a
chair
at
one
end
of
a
long
table
you
may
line
this
hat
then
she
gave
patty
an
elaborate
velvet
hat
trimmed
with
feathers
and
materials
for
sewing
she
also
gave
her
white
silk
for
the
lining
of
the
hat
and
a
piece
stamped
with
gilt
letters
which
patty
knew
must
be
placed
inside
the
crown
it
all
seemed
easy
too
easy
in
fact
for
patty
aspired
to
making
velvet
rosettes
and
placing
ostrich
plumes
but
she
knew
she
was
being
tested
and
she
set
to
work
at
her
task
with
energy
though
she
had
never
lined
a
hat
before
she
knew
in
a
general
way
how
it
should
be
done
and
she
tried
to
go
about
it
with
an
air
of
experience
the
other
girls
at
the
table
cast
furtive
glances
at
her
though
they
were
not
rude
they
showed
that
air
of
hostile
criticism
so
often
shown
by
habitu√©s
to
a
newcomer
though
based
on
nothing
but
prejudiced
curiosity
but
as
patty
began
to
cut
the
lining
she
saw
involuntary
smiles
spring
to
their
faces
she
knew
that
she
must
be
cutting
it
wrongly
but
it
seemed
to
her
the
only
way
to
cut
it
so
she
went
on
the
girls
began
to
nudge
each
other
and
to
smile
more
openly
and
to
her
own
chagrin
patty
felt
her
cheeks
growing
red
with
embarrassment
she
was
tempted
to
speak
pleasantly
to
them
and
ask
what
her
mistake
was
but
a
strange
notion
of
honesty
forbade
this
she
had
said
at
home
that
she
believed
it
would
be
possible
for
her
to
earn
her
living
without
special
instruction
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
if
she
now
asked
for
advice
it
would
be
like
getting
special
training
though
in
a
small
degree
so
she
went
calmly
on
with
her
work
cut
and
fitted
the
hat
lining
and
carefully
sewed
it
in
the
hat
remembering
that
the
stitch
she
used
on
her
white
work
had
been
criticised
as
too
long
she
now
was
careful
to
take
very
short
stitches
and
she
used
her
utmost
endeavour
to
make
her
work
neat
and
dainty
miss
passed
her
chair
two
or
three
times
while
the
work
was
in
progress
but
she
made
no
comment
of
any
sort
it
was
perhaps
eleven
when
patty
completed
the
task
next
time
miss
came
by
her
she
handed
her
the
hat
with
an
unmistakable
air
of
triumph
i
done
it
patty
thought
to
herself
exultantly
i
lined
that
hat
and
if
i
do
say
it
that
should
it
done
perfectly
neat
smooth
and
correct
in
every
particular
while
patty
was
indulging
in
these
thoughts
miss
took
the
hat
from
her
hand
she
gave
it
a
quick
glance
then
she
looked
at
patty
had
patty
looked
more
meek
had
she
seemed
to
await
miss
opinion
of
her
work
the
result
might
have
been
different
but
patty
expression
was
so
plainly
that
of
a
conquering
hero
she
showed
so
palpably
her
pride
in
her
own
achievement
that
miss
eyes
narrowed
and
her
face
hardened
without
a
word
to
patty
she
handed
the
hat
to
a
young
woman
at
another
table
and
said
line
this
hat
miss
harrigan
yes
said
the
girl
and
even
as
patty
watched
her
she
began
to
snip
deftly
at
patty
small
careful
stitches
and
in
a
few
moments
the
lining
was
out
and
the
girl
was
shaping
and
cutting
a
new
one
with
a
quick
sure
touch
and
with
not
so
much
as
a
glance
in
patty
direction
the
other
girls
the
ones
at
patty
table
looked
horrified
but
they
did
not
look
openly
at
patty
furtively
they
darted
glances
at
her
from
beneath
lids
and
then
as
furtively
glanced
at
each
other
it
all
struck
patty
humorously
to
have
her
careful
work
discarded
and
snipped
out
to
be
replaced
by
skilled
labour
seemed
so
funny
that
she
wanted
to
laugh
aloud
but
she
was
also
deeply
chagrined
at
her
failure
and
so
it
was
an
uncertain
attitude
of
mind
that
showed
upon
her
face
as
miss
again
approached
her
without
making
any
reference
to
the
work
she
had
already
done
miss
gave
patty
a
hat
frame
and
some
thick
soft
satin
cover
the
frame
neatly
miss
fairfield
was
all
she
said
and
walked
away
patty
understood
it
was
her
own
independent
and
assured
attitude
that
had
led
miss
to
pursue
this
course
she
did
for
a
moment
think
that
all
beginners
were
treated
like
this
but
she
had
asked
to
be
given
a
fair
trial
and
she
was
getting
it
moreover
she
half
suspected
that
miss
knew
she
was
not
really
under
the
necessity
of
earning
her
own
living
though
wearing
her
plainest
clothes
all
the
details
of
her
costume
betokened
an
affluence
that
could
be
concealed
astute
patty
began
to
think
that
miss
saw
through
her
and
that
she
was
cleverly
getting
even
with
her
however
she
took
the
hat
frame
and
the
satin
and
set
to
work
in
thorough
earnest
though
not
poor
she
could
not
have
tried
any
harder
to
succeed
had
she
been
in
direst
want
but
as
to
her
work
she
was
very
much
at
sea
she
knew
she
had
to
get
the
satin
on
to
the
frame
without
crease
or
wrinkle
she
knew
exactly
how
it
ought
to
look
when
done
for
she
had
a
hat
of
that
sort
herself
and
the
material
covered
the
foundation
as
creaselessly
as
paint
i
sure
it
only
needs
gumption
thought
patty
hopefully
here
my
real
chance
to
prove
that
it
does
need
a
series
of
lessons
to
get
some
satin
smoothly
on
a
crinoline
frame
if
i
do
it
neatly
she
wo
ask
some
other
girl
to
do
it
over
paying
no
attention
to
the
covert
glances
of
her
companions
patty
set
to
work
she
cut
carefully
she
fitted
neatly
she
pinned
and
she
basted
she
smoothed
and
she
patted
and
finally
she
sewed
with
tiny
close
stitches
placed
evenly
and
with
great
precision
so
absorbed
did
she
become
in
her
task
that
she
failed
to
notice
the
departure
of
the
others
at
noon
alone
she
sat
there
at
the
table
snipping
sewing
pinning
and
patting
the
somewhat
refractory
satin
it
was
almost
one
when
she
finished
and
looked
up
suddenly
to
see
miss
standing
watching
her
why
are
you
doing
this
she
said
to
patty
as
she
took
the
hat
from
the
girl
hands
patty
sat
up
all
at
once
conscious
of
great
pain
in
the
back
of
her
neck
from
her
continued
cramped
position
at
work
because
i
want
to
earn
money
replied
patty
not
pertly
but
in
a
tone
of
obstinate
intent
is
it
done
right
miss
looked
at
patty
with
an
air
of
kindliness
and
willingness
to
help
her
tell
me
all
about
it
she
said
but
patty
was
in
no
mood
for
confidences
and
with
a
shade
of
hauteur
in
her
manner
she
said
again
is
it
done
right
does
it
suit
you
at
patty
rejection
of
her
advances
miss
also
became
reserved
again
and
said
simply
i
can
not
use
it
why
not
demanded
patty
it
is
covered
smoothly
and
neatly
it
shows
no
crease
nor
fold
it
is
not
right
said
miss
it
is
not
done
right
because
you
do
not
know
how
to
do
it
you
have
never
been
taught
how
to
cover
hats
or
how
to
line
them
consequently
you
can
not
do
them
right
the
other
girls
had
gone
to
luncheon
so
the
two
were
alone
in
the
room
patty
knew
that
miss
was
telling
her
the
truth
and
yet
she
resented
it
a
red
spot
burned
in
each
cheek
as
she
answered
but
the
hat
is
covered
perfectly
what
matter
then
whether
i
have
been
taught
or
not
excuse
me
it
is
covered
perfectly
the
stitches
are
too
small
too
small
exclaimed
patty
why
i
did
know
stitches
could
be
too
the
other
smiled
that
is
my
argument
she
said
you
of
course
stitches
should
be
small
for
ordinary
sewing
and
for
many
sorts
of
work
but
not
for
millinery
here
long
stitches
are
wanted
but
they
must
be
rightly
set
not
careless
long
stitches
why
said
patty
somewhat
subdued
now
because
a
better
effect
can
be
produced
with
long
stitches
you
see
your
stitches
are
small
and
true
but
every
one
shows
with
a
skilful
long
stitch
no
stitch
is
seen
at
all
it
is
what
we
call
a
blind
stitch
and
can
only
be
successfully
done
by
skilled
workers
who
have
been
taught
and
who
have
also
had
practice
patty
was
silent
a
moment
then
she
said
miss
we
agreed
that
i
was
to
have
a
day
trial
yes
miss
fairfield
i
will
stand
by
my
word
then
may
i
select
my
own
work
for
the
afternoon
yes
said
miss
wondering
whether
after
all
this
pretty
young
girl
could
be
a
harmless
lunatic
then
i
want
to
trim
hats
make
bows
you
know
sew
on
flowers
or
feathers
or
adjust
lace
may
i
do
such
things
as
that
miss
hesitated
yes
she
said
finally
if
you
will
be
careful
not
to
injure
the
materials
you
see
if
your
work
should
have
to
be
done
over
i
want
the
materials
spoiled
i
promise
said
patty
slowly
but
first
will
you
not
go
out
for
your
lunch
no
thank
you
i
not
hungry
please
bring
me
my
work
at
once
chapter
xii
three
hats
but
miss
sent
patty
a
cup
of
hot
bouillon
and
some
biscuit
which
she
ate
right
there
at
her
and
it
was
a
kindly
act
for
though
patty
did
realise
it
she
was
really
faint
for
want
of
food
and
also
for
fresh
air
the
room
though
large
had
many
occupants
and
now
the
girls
began
to
come
back
from
their
luncheon
and
their
chatter
made
patty
head
ache
but
she
was
doing
some
deep
thinking
her
theories
about
unskilled
labour
had
received
a
hard
blow
and
she
was
beginning
to
think
her
millinery
efforts
were
not
going
to
be
successful
but
i
a
chance
yet
she
thought
as
miss
came
bringing
two
hats
and
a
large
box
of
handsome
trimmings
the
other
girls
stared
at
this
for
they
knew
that
patty
morning
efforts
had
been
far
from
successful
but
patty
only
smiled
at
them
in
a
pleasant
but
impersonal
manner
as
she
took
up
her
new
work
her
confidence
returned
she
knew
she
could
do
what
she
was
now
about
to
attempt
for
added
to
her
natural
taste
and
love
of
colour
she
had
been
critically
interested
in
hats
while
in
paris
and
while
visiting
her
friend
lady
kitty
who
was
especially
extravagant
in
her
millinery
purchases
after
a
period
of
thought
patty
decided
on
her
scheme
of
trimming
for
the
two
hats
before
her
and
then
set
blithely
to
work
one
was
to
be
a
simple
style
of
decoration
the
other
much
more
complicated
taking
up
the
elaborate
one
first
patty
went
at
it
with
energy
and
with
an
assured
touch
for
she
had
the
effect
definitely
pictured
in
her
imagination
and
was
sure
she
could
materialise
it
and
she
did
after
about
two
hours
hard
work
patty
achieved
a
triumph
she
held
up
the
finished
hat
and
every
girl
at
the
table
uttered
an
ah
of
admiration
at
the
beautiful
sight
without
response
other
than
a
quiet
smile
patty
took
up
the
second
hat
this
was
simple
but
daring
in
its
very
simplicity
a
black
velvet
gainsborough
with
broad
rolling
brim
patty
turned
it
smartly
up
at
one
side
and
fastened
it
with
a
rosette
of
dull
blue
velvet
and
a
silver
buckle
just
then
miss
came
in
where
did
that
hat
come
from
she
said
pointing
to
patty
finished
confection
i
trimmed
it
said
patty
nonchalantly
have
you
some
silver
hatpins
miss
you
trimmed
it
exclaimed
the
forewoman
ignoring
patty
question
and
taking
up
the
trimmed
hat
yes
do
you
like
it
it
a
marvel
it
looks
like
a
french
hat
how
did
you
know
enough
to
trim
it
like
this
i
thought
it
would
look
well
that
way
but
these
twists
of
velvet
they
have
a
touch
yes
said
patty
inwardly
exultant
but
outwardly
calm
and
now
she
went
on
this
hat
is
of
another
type
it
not
finished
asked
miss
eyeing
the
hat
in
uncertainty
and
yet
any
other
trimming
would
spoil
its
lines
just
so
said
patty
placidly
you
see
all
it
needs
now
is
two
large
silver
hatpins
like
this
see
patty
pulled
two
hatpins
from
her
own
hat
which
she
still
had
on
and
placed
them
carefully
in
the
hat
she
held
in
her
hand
these
pins
are
too
small
but
you
see
what
i
mean
miss
did
see
she
saw
that
two
larger
pins
would
finish
the
hat
with
just
the
right
touch
while
any
other
decoration
would
spoil
it
she
looked
at
patty
curiously
you
a
genius
miss
fairfield
she
said
will
you
trim
another
hat
yes
said
patty
looking
at
her
watch
it
only
four
may
i
have
an
evening
hat
please
you
may
have
whatever
you
like
come
and
select
for
yourself
patty
went
to
the
cases
and
chose
a
large
white
beaver
with
soft
broad
brim
i
will
make
you
a
picture
hat
to
put
in
your
window
she
said
smiling
she
selected
some
trimmings
and
returned
to
her
seat
at
the
table
it
was
rather
more
than
half
an
hour
later
when
she
showed
miss
her
work
there
not
much
work
on
it
patty
said
slowly
i
spent
the
time
thinking
it
out
there
was
not
much
work
on
it
to
be
sure
and
yet
it
was
a
hat
of
great
distinction
the
white
brim
rolled
slightly
back
and
where
it
touched
the
low
crown
it
met
two
immense
roses
one
black
and
one
of
palest
pink
two
slight
sprays
of
foliage
made
of
black
velvet
leaves
nestled
between
the
roses
and
completed
the
trimming
the
roses
were
of
abnormal
size
and
great
beauty
but
it
was
the
mode
of
their
adjustment
that
secured
the
extremely
effect
miss
eyes
sparkled
it
a
masterpiece
she
said
clasping
her
hands
in
admiration
you
have
trimmed
hats
before
miss
fairfield
no
said
patty
but
i
always
knew
i
could
do
it
yes
you
can
said
miss
will
you
come
now
and
talk
to
madame
ushered
into
the
presence
of
madame
villard
patty
suddenly
experienced
a
revulsion
of
feeling
her
triumph
over
miss
seemed
small
and
petty
she
was
conscious
of
a
revolt
against
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
place
the
suavity
of
miss
manner
the
artificial
grandeur
of
madame
villard
filled
her
with
aversion
and
she
wanted
only
to
get
away
and
get
back
to
her
own
home
not
for
any
amount
per
week
would
she
come
again
to
this
dreadful
place
she
knew
it
was
unreasonable
she
knew
that
if
she
were
to
earn
her
living
it
could
not
be
in
a
sheltered
luxurious
home
but
must
perforce
be
in
some
unattractive
workroom
but
rather
a
department
store
thought
poor
patty
than
in
this
place
with
these
overdressed
overmannered
women
who
ape
fine
manners
patty
was
overwrought
and
nervous
her
long
hard
day
had
worn
her
out
and
it
was
no
wonder
she
felt
a
distaste
for
the
whole
thing
you
are
certainly
clever
said
madame
villard
patronisingly
as
she
looked
at
the
hats
miss
held
up
for
her
inspection
i
am
glad
to
offer
you
a
permanent
position
here
you
will
have
to
learn
the
rudiments
of
the
work
as
the
most
gifted
genius
should
always
be
familiar
with
the
foundations
of
his
own
art
will
you
agree
to
come
to
me
every
day
patty
hesitated
she
hated
the
thought
of
coming
every
day
even
if
but
for
a
week
and
yet
here
was
the
opportunity
she
was
in
search
of
trimming
hats
was
easy
enough
work
probably
they
would
make
her
learn
lining
and
covering
at
once
then
the
thought
occurred
to
her
that
it
would
be
honest
to
pretend
she
was
coming
regularly
when
she
meant
to
do
so
only
for
a
week
suppose
i
try
it
for
a
week
she
suggested
then
if
either
of
us
wishes
to
do
so
we
can
terminate
the
contract
very
well
said
madame
who
thought
to
herself
she
could
make
this
young
genius
trim
a
great
many
hats
in
a
week
do
you
agree
to
that
at
what
salary
asked
patty
faintly
for
she
felt
as
if
she
were
condemning
herself
to
a
week
of
torture
well
said
madame
villard
as
you
are
so
ignorant
of
the
work
i
ought
not
to
give
you
any
recompense
at
all
but
as
you
evince
such
an
aptitude
for
trimming
i
am
willing
to
say
five
dollars
a
week
five
dollars
a
week
repeated
patty
slowly
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
patty
did
not
mean
to
be
rude
or
impertinent
indeed
for
the
moment
she
was
not
even
thinking
of
herself
she
was
thinking
how
a
poor
girl
who
had
her
living
to
earn
would
feel
at
an
offer
of
five
dollars
for
six
long
days
of
work
in
that
dreadful
atmosphere
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
mechanically
and
she
said
it
more
because
of
madame
villard
look
of
amazement
than
because
of
any
regret
at
her
own
blunt
speech
i
should
have
spoken
so
frankly
but
the
compensation
you
offer
is
utterly
inadequate
patty
glanced
at
her
watch
and
then
began
drawing
on
her
gloves
with
an
air
of
finality
but
wait
wait
miss
fairfield
exclaimed
the
madame
who
had
no
wish
to
let
her
genius
thus
slip
away
from
her
i
like
your
work
i
may
say
i
think
it
shows
touches
of
real
talent
also
you
have
unusually
good
taste
in
view
of
these
things
i
will
overlook
still
further
your
ignorance
of
the
details
of
the
work
and
i
will
give
you
seven
dollars
a
week
madame
said
patty
i
am
inexperienced
in
the
matter
of
wages
but
i
feel
sure
that
you
either
employ
inferior
workwomen
or
that
you
underpay
them
i
do
know
which
but
i
assure
you
that
i
could
not
think
of
accepting
your
offer
of
seven
dollars
a
week
would
you
come
for
ten
asked
madame
villard
eagerly
no
said
patty
shortly
for
twelve
then
this
is
my
ultimate
offer
and
you
would
do
well
to
consider
it
carefully
i
have
never
paid
so
much
to
any
workwoman
and
i
offer
it
to
you
only
because
i
chance
to
like
your
style
of
work
and
that
is
your
ultimate
offer
said
patty
looking
at
her
squarely
yes
and
i
am
foolish
to
offer
that
but
as
we
agreed
it
is
only
for
one
week
and
so
spare
your
arguments
madame
i
do
not
accept
your
proposal
twelve
dollars
a
week
is
not
enough
and
now
i
will
bid
you
am
i
entitled
to
pay
for
my
day
work
with
patty
final
refusal
the
manner
of
madame
villard
had
changed
no
longer
placating
and
bland
she
frowned
angrily
as
she
said
pay
indeed
you
should
be
charged
for
the
materials
you
spoiled
in
your
morning
work
but
in
the
afternoon
said
patty
i
trimmed
three
hats
that
will
bring
you
big
profits
nothing
of
the
sort
snapped
madame
the
hats
you
trimmed
are
nothing
of
any
moment
any
of
my
girls
could
have
done
as
well
then
why
do
you
pay
them
twelve
dollars
a
week
cried
patty
whose
harassed
nerves
were
making
her
irritable
i
will
call
our
financial
account
even
but
if
any
of
your
workwomen
can
trim
hats
that
you
like
as
well
as
those
that
i
trimmed
i
trust
you
will
give
them
the
salary
you
offered
me
patty
bowed
politely
and
then
with
a
more
kindly
bow
and
smile
to
miss
she
went
through
the
draperies
through
the
front
salesroom
and
out
at
the
front
door
the
milliner
and
her
forewoman
followed
her
with
a
dignified
slowness
but
reached
the
window
in
time
to
see
patty
get
into
an
which
rolled
rapidly
away
she
one
of
those
society
women
who
spy
out
what
wages
we
pay
said
madame
villard
with
conviction
she
not
old
enough
for
that
returned
miss
but
she
not
looking
for
real
work
either
i
ca
make
her
out
well
we
have
three
stunning
hats
anyway
put
them
in
the
window
and
you
may
as
well
put
paris
labels
inside
they
have
an
air
of
the
real
thing
that
evening
patty
regaled
her
parents
with
a
truthful
account
of
her
day
i
again
she
said
laughing
but
the
whole
performance
was
so
funny
i
must
tell
you
about
it
could
you
have
coaxed
fifteen
dollars
a
week
out
of
her
asked
fairfield
after
patty
had
told
how
madame
villard
price
had
gradually
increased
oh
father
i
was
so
afraid
she
say
fifteen
then
i
should
have
felt
that
i
ought
to
go
to
her
for
a
week
for
i
may
not
get
another
such
chance
but
i
could
live
in
that
place
a
week
i
i
could
why
asked
nan
curiously
i
do
know
exactly
why
returned
patty
thoughtfully
but
mostly
because
it
all
so
artificial
and
untrue
miss
talks
as
if
she
were
a
superior
being
madame
villard
talks
as
if
she
were
a
royal
personage
they
talk
about
their
customers
and
each
other
in
a
sort
of
grandiose
way
that
is
as
sickening
as
it
is
absurd
i
know
how
to
express
it
but
i
rather
work
in
a
place
where
everybody
is
real
and
claims
only
such
honour
and
glory
as
absolutely
belong
to
them
i
hate
pretence
good
little
patty
said
her
father
heartily
i
glad
you
do
oh
i
tell
you
my
girl
you
learn
some
valuable
lessons
even
if
you
achieve
your
fifteen
dollars
but
i
shall
do
that
too
father
you
need
think
i
conquered
yet
pooh
what
three
failures
to
a
determined
nature
like
mine
what
indeed
laughed
fairfield
go
ahead
my
plucky
little
heroine
you
strike
it
right
yet
i
sure
i
shall
declared
patty
with
such
a
air
of
complacency
that
both
her
hearers
laughed
chapter
xiii
the
thursday
club
as
patty
was
temporarily
out
of
an
occupation
she
went
skating
the
next
day
with
the
farringtons
and
kenneth
indeed
the
four
were
so
often
together
that
they
began
to
call
themselves
the
quartette
after
a
jolly
skate
which
made
their
cheeks
rosy
they
all
went
back
to
patty
as
they
usually
did
after
skating
i
think
you
might
come
to
my
house
sometimes
said
elise
oh
i
have
to
go
to
patty
to
look
after
the
goldfish
said
kenneth
i
thought
darby
swam
lame
the
last
time
i
saw
him
does
he
patty
no
not
now
but
juliet
has
a
cold
and
i
afraid
of
rheumatism
setting
in
no
said
kenneth
she
too
young
for
rheumatism
but
she
may
have
knee
you
must
be
very
careful
about
draughts
the
goldfish
were
a
source
of
fun
for
the
quartette
the
fish
themselves
were
quiet
inoffensive
little
creatures
but
the
ready
imagination
of
the
young
people
invested
them
with
all
sorts
of
strange
qualities
both
physical
and
mental
juliet
still
sulky
about
that
thimble
said
roger
as
they
all
looked
into
the
fishes
globe
i
gave
her
patty
thimble
yesterday
to
wear
for
a
hat
and
it
did
suit
her
at
all
i
should
say
not
cried
patty
she
thought
it
was
a
helmet
you
must
take
her
for
joan
of
arc
she
did
wear
a
helmet
said
elise
laughing
well
she
wore
armour
they
belong
together
anyway
juliet
does
know
but
that
joan
of
arc
wore
a
helmet
oh
is
that
what
made
her
so
sulky
said
roger
nice
disposition
i
must
say
she
nervous
put
in
kenneth
and
a
little
morbid
poor
thing
patty
i
think
a
little
iron
in
the
water
would
do
her
good
send
for
a
flatiron
patty
said
roger
i
know
it
would
help
her
if
you
set
it
carefully
on
top
of
her
i
wo
do
it
said
patty
poor
juliet
is
flat
enough
now
she
eat
enough
to
keep
a
bird
alive
let
go
away
and
leave
her
to
sleep
that
will
fatten
her
maybe
lullaby
julie
in
the
sang
roger
when
the
wind
blows
the
billows
will
roll
continued
elise
fanning
the
water
in
the
globe
with
a
newspaper
when
the
bowl
breaks
the
fishes
will
fall
contributed
patty
and
ken
wound
up
by
singing
and
the
cat
will
eat
juliet
darby
and
all
oh
horrible
cried
patty
indeed
she
wo
my
beautiful
pets
shall
never
meet
that
cruel
fate
leaving
juliet
to
her
much
needed
nap
they
all
strolled
into
the
library
let
be
a
club
said
elise
just
us
four
you
know
all
right
said
patty
who
loved
clubs
what
sort
of
a
club
musical
said
elise
we
all
sing
musical
clubs
are
foolish
said
roger
let
be
a
dramatic
club
dramatic
clubs
are
too
much
work
said
patty
and
four
is
enough
for
that
anyway
let
do
good
oh
patty
groaned
kenneth
you
getting
so
eleemosynary
there
no
fun
in
you
mercy
gracious
cried
patty
was
that
fearful
word
you
said
ken
no
do
say
it
over
again
i
ca
stand
all
of
it
at
once
well
we
have
to
stand
you
grumbled
kenneth
and
you
all
the
time
now
what
foolishness
are
you
going
to
fly
at
next
trying
to
earn
a
dishonest
penny
i
thinking
of
going
out
as
a
cook
said
patty
her
eyes
twinkling
cooking
is
the
only
thing
i
really
know
how
to
do
but
i
can
do
that
you
be
fine
as
cook
said
roger
may
i
come
round
thursday
afternoons
and
take
you
out
i
i
only
have
every
other
thursday
said
patty
demurely
and
the
other
thursday
you
wo
be
there
but
what
about
this
club
we
organising
make
it
musical
said
kenneth
and
then
while
one
of
us
is
playing
or
singing
some
classical
selection
the
others
can
indulge
in
merry
conversation
you
may
as
well
make
it
the
patty
club
said
elise
as
i
suppose
it
will
always
meet
here
though
not
really
jealous
of
her
friend
popularity
elise
always
resented
the
fact
that
the
young
people
would
rather
be
at
patty
than
at
her
own
home
the
reason
was
that
the
fairfield
house
though
handsomely
appointed
was
not
so
formally
grand
as
the
farringtons
and
there
was
always
an
atmosphere
of
cordiality
and
hospitality
at
patty
while
at
elise
it
was
oppressively
formal
and
dignified
oh
pshaw
said
patty
ignoring
elise
unkind
intent
i
wo
have
you
always
here
we
take
turns
of
course
all
right
said
elise
every
other
week
at
my
house
and
every
other
week
here
but
do
you
think
we
ought
to
have
more
than
four
members
no
i
do
declared
kenneth
promptly
and
we
do
want
any
musical
nonsense
or
any
dramatic
foolishness
either
let
just
have
fun
if
it
pleasant
weather
we
go
skating
or
sleighing
or
motoring
or
whatever
you
like
if
it
is
we
stay
indoors
or
go
to
a
matin√©e
or
concert
or
something
like
that
lovely
cried
elise
but
if
we
to
go
to
matin√©es
we
have
to
meet
saturdays
or
wednesdays
amended
patty
let
meet
wednesdays
i
always
have
engagements
on
saturdays
all
right
shall
we
call
it
the
wednesday
club
then
no
elise
said
roger
gravely
that
too
obvious
we
will
call
it
the
thursday
club
because
we
meet
on
wednesday
see
no
i
do
see
said
elise
looking
puzzled
why
explained
roger
you
see
we
spend
all
day
thursday
thinking
over
the
good
time
we
had
on
wednesday
but
that
is
the
real
reason
said
patty
giggling
the
real
reason
we
call
it
the
thursday
club
is
because
it
meets
on
wednesday
that
it
patsy
said
ken
approvingly
for
he
and
patty
had
the
same
love
for
nonsense
though
more
practical
elise
could
always
understand
it
well
then
the
thursday
club
will
meet
here
next
wednesday
said
patty
unless
i
am
otherwise
engaged
for
she
just
happened
to
think
that
on
that
day
she
might
be
again
attempting
to
earn
her
fifteen
dollars
what
the
thursday
club
may
i
belong
said
a
pleasant
voice
and
hepworth
came
in
oh
how
do
you
do
cried
patty
jumping
up
and
offering
both
hands
i
so
glad
to
see
you
do
sit
down
i
came
round
said
hepworth
after
greeting
the
others
in
hopes
i
could
corral
a
cup
of
tea
i
thought
you
ran
a
we
do
said
patty
ringing
a
bell
nearby
that
is
we
always
have
tea
when
nan
is
home
and
we
can
just
as
well
have
it
when
she
is
i
suppose
you
young
people
do
care
for
tea
went
on
hepworth
looking
a
little
enviously
at
the
merry
group
who
indeed
did
care
whether
they
had
tea
or
not
oh
yes
we
do
said
patty
we
love
it
but
we
we
just
forgot
it
we
were
so
engrossed
in
organising
a
club
but
the
others
did
not
follow
up
this
conversational
beginning
and
even
before
the
tea
was
brought
elise
said
she
must
go
nonsense
said
patty
do
go
yet
but
elise
was
decided
so
away
she
went
and
of
course
roger
went
too
and
i
going
said
kenneth
as
patty
having
followed
elise
out
into
the
hall
he
joined
them
there
oh
do
you
go
ken
said
patty
yes
i
rather
when
hepworth
comes
you
get
so
all
of
a
sudden
with
your
how
do
you
do
and
your
kenneth
mimicked
patty
voice
which
did
sound
different
when
she
spoke
to
hepworth
ken
you
very
unjust
said
patty
her
cheeks
flushing
of
course
i
have
to
give
hepworth
tea
when
he
asks
for
it
and
if
i
seem
more
with
him
it
because
he
so
much
older
than
you
are
he
is
indeed
about
twelve
years
older
too
old
to
be
your
friend
he
ought
to
be
calling
on
mrs
fairfield
he
is
he
calls
on
us
both
i
think
you
very
silly
this
conversation
had
been
in
undertones
while
elise
was
donning
her
hat
and
furs
and
great
was
her
curiosity
when
patty
turned
from
kenneth
with
an
offended
or
hurt
expression
on
her
face
what
the
matter
with
you
two
she
asked
bluntly
nothing
said
ken
looking
humble
patty
been
begging
me
to
be
more
polite
to
the
goldfish
nonsense
laughed
patty
your
manners
are
above
reproach
ken
thanks
fair
lady
he
replied
with
a
chesterfieldian
bow
and
then
the
three
went
away
did
i
drive
off
your
young
friends
patty
said
hepworth
as
she
returned
to
the
library
where
jane
was
already
setting
forth
the
tea
things
patty
was
nonplussed
he
certainly
had
driven
them
away
but
she
exactly
tell
him
so
you
need
answer
he
said
laughing
at
her
dismayed
expression
i
am
sorry
they
do
like
me
but
until
you
show
that
you
do
i
shall
continue
to
come
here
i
hope
you
will
said
patty
earnestly
it
is
that
they
do
like
you
hepworth
it
that
they
think
you
do
like
them
what
oh
i
do
mean
exactly
that
but
they
think
that
you
think
children
almost
and
you
bored
by
them
i
not
bored
by
you
and
you
a
child
almost
well
i
do
know
how
it
is
said
patty
throwing
off
all
responsibility
in
the
matter
but
i
like
them
and
i
like
you
and
yet
i
rather
have
you
at
different
times
which
do
you
like
better
asked
hepworth
he
knew
it
was
a
foolish
question
but
it
was
uttered
almost
involuntarily
them
said
patty
but
she
gave
him
such
a
roguish
smile
as
she
said
it
that
he
almost
thought
she
meant
the
opposite
still
she
went
on
with
what
was
palpably
a
mock
regret
i
shall
have
to
put
up
with
you
for
the
present
so
be
as
young
as
you
can
how
many
lumps
please
two
you
see
i
can
be
very
young
yes
said
patty
approvingly
it
is
young
to
take
two
lumps
but
now
tell
me
something
about
miss
farley
have
you
heard
from
her
or
of
her
lately
yes
i
have
said
hepworth
as
he
stirred
his
tea
that
is
heard
of
her
my
friend
down
in
virginia
who
knows
miss
farley
has
sent
me
another
of
her
sketches
and
it
proves
more
positively
than
ever
that
the
girl
has
real
genius
but
patty
i
want
you
to
give
up
this
scheme
of
yours
to
help
her
it
was
good
of
your
father
to
make
the
offer
he
did
but
i
do
want
you
racing
around
to
these
dreadful
places
looking
for
work
i
going
to
get
some
other
people
interested
in
miss
farley
and
i
sure
her
art
education
can
be
managed
in
some
way
willingly
subscribe
the
whole
sum
needed
myself
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
arrange
it
that
way
she
never
accept
it
if
she
knew
and
it
difficult
to
deceive
her
patty
looked
serious
i
do
wonder
you
think
i
ca
do
what
i
set
out
to
do
she
said
slowly
for
i
made
so
many
ridiculous
failures
already
but
please
do
lose
faith
in
me
yet
give
me
one
or
two
more
chances
hepworth
looked
kindly
into
patty
earnest
eyes
do
take
this
thing
too
seriously
he
said
but
i
want
to
take
it
seriously
you
think
i
a
child
a
butterfly
i
assure
you
i
am
neither
i
think
you
adorable
whatever
you
are
was
on
the
tip
of
gilbert
hepworth
tongue
but
he
did
not
say
it
though
he
cared
more
for
patty
than
for
anything
on
earth
he
had
vowed
to
himself
the
girl
should
never
know
it
he
was
and
patty
but
eighteen
and
he
knew
that
was
too
great
a
discrepancy
in
years
for
him
ever
to
hope
to
win
her
affections
so
he
contented
himself
with
an
occasional
evening
call
or
once
in
a
while
dropping
in
at
tea
time
resolved
never
to
show
to
patty
herself
the
high
regard
he
had
for
her
she
had
told
him
of
her
various
unsuccessful
attempts
at
earning
her
living
and
he
deeply
regretted
that
he
had
been
the
means
of
bringing
about
the
situation
he
did
not
share
fairfield
opinion
that
the
experience
was
a
good
one
for
patty
and
would
broaden
her
views
of
humanity
in
general
and
teach
her
a
few
lessons
please
give
up
the
notion
he
urged
after
they
had
talked
the
matter
over
indeed
i
wo
returned
patty
at
least
not
until
i
proved
to
my
own
satisfaction
that
my
theories
are
wrong
and
i
do
think
yet
that
they
are
i
still
believe
i
can
earn
fifteen
dollars
a
week
without
having
had
special
training
for
any
work
surely
i
ought
to
have
time
to
prove
myself
right
yes
you
ought
to
have
time
said
hepworth
gently
but
you
ought
not
to
do
it
at
all
it
an
absurd
proposition
the
whole
thing
and
as
i
unfortunately
brought
it
about
i
want
to
ask
you
please
to
drop
it
no
sir
said
patty
gravely
but
wagging
a
roguish
forefinger
at
him
people
ca
undo
their
mistakes
so
easily
if
as
you
say
you
brought
about
this
painful
situation
then
you
must
sit
patiently
by
and
watch
me
as
i
flounder
about
in
the
various
sloughs
of
despond
oh
patty
do
please
drop
it
all
for
my
sake
patty
looked
up
in
surprise
at
his
earnest
tones
but
she
only
laughed
gaily
and
said
nixy
not
i
not
by
no
means
but
i
give
in
to
this
extent
agree
not
to
make
more
than
three
more
attempts
if
i
ca
succeed
in
three
more
efforts
i
give
up
the
game
and
confess
myself
a
butterfly
and
an
idiot
the
only
symptoms
of
idiocy
are
shown
in
your
making
three
more
attempts
said
hepworth
who
was
almost
angry
at
persistence
oh
pooh
i
probably
sha
make
three
more
i
just
somehow
feel
sure
i
succeed
the
very
next
time
a
sanguine
idiot
is
the
most
hopeless
sort
said
hepworth
with
a
resigned
air
may
i
ask
what
you
intend
to
attempt
next
you
may
ask
but
you
ca
be
answered
for
i
do
yet
know
myself
i
two
or
three
tempting
plans
but
i
do
know
which
to
choose
thought
of
taking
a
place
as
cook
patty
do
you
dare
do
such
a
thing
to
think
of
you
in
a
kitchen
under
orders
oh
child
how
you
patty
laughed
outright
at
hepworth
dismay
cheer
up
she
cried
i
did
mean
it
but
you
think
skilled
labour
is
necessary
and
truly
i
skilled
in
cooking
i
really
am
yes
trifles
and
fancy
desserts
well
those
are
good
things
for
a
cook
to
know
patty
promise
me
you
wo
take
any
sort
of
a
servant
position
oh
i
ca
promise
that
i
fancy
i
make
a
rather
good
or
but
i
promise
you
i
wo
be
a
cook
much
as
i
like
to
fuss
with
a
i
should
like
to
be
kept
in
a
kitchen
and
boil
and
roast
things
all
the
time
i
should
say
not
well
since
i
ca
persuade
you
to
give
up
your
foolish
notion
do
go
on
and
get
through
with
your
three
attempts
as
soon
as
possible
remember
you
promised
not
more
than
three
i
promise
said
patty
with
much
solemnity
and
then
nan
and
fairfield
came
in
hepworth
appealed
at
once
to
fairfield
telling
him
what
he
had
already
told
patty
nonsense
hepworth
said
patty
father
i
glad
you
started
the
ball
rolling
it
has
done
patty
a
bit
of
harm
so
far
and
it
will
be
an
experience
she
always
remember
let
her
go
ahead
she
ca
succeed
but
she
can
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
she
tried
i
not
so
sure
she
ca
succeed
said
nan
standing
up
for
patty
who
looked
a
little
crestfallen
at
the
remarks
of
her
father
good
for
you
nan
cried
patty
i
justify
your
faith
in
me
yet
i
know
hepworth
thinks
i
good
for
nothing
but
daddy
ought
to
know
me
better
hepworth
seemed
not
to
notice
this
petulant
outburst
and
only
said
remember
you
promised
to
withdraw
from
the
arena
after
three
more
conflicts
they
wo
be
conflicts
said
patty
and
there
wo
be
but
one
anyway
so
much
the
better
said
hepworth
calmly
chapter
xiv
van
reypen
it
was
about
a
week
later
nothing
further
had
been
said
or
done
in
the
matter
of
patty
occupation
and
and
fairfield
wondered
what
plan
was
slowly
brewing
under
the
mop
of
golden
curls
hepworth
began
to
hope
his
words
had
had
an
effect
after
all
and
was
about
to
lay
the
case
of
miss
farley
before
some
other
true
and
tried
friends
but
he
had
practically
promised
patty
to
give
her
time
for
three
more
attempts
so
he
waited
one
day
patty
came
into
the
house
just
in
time
for
luncheon
nan
she
said
as
they
sat
down
at
the
table
i
struck
it
right
this
time
said
nan
raising
her
eyebrows
quizzically
yes
i
have
you
need
laugh
like
that
i
did
laugh
yes
you
did
behind
your
eyes
but
i
saw
you
now
as
i
tell
you
this
time
conquers
good
for
you
patsy
let
me
congratulate
you
let
me
do
it
now
lest
i
should
be
able
to
do
it
later
huh
i
thought
you
had
faith
in
me
and
so
i
have
patty
girl
said
nan
growing
serious
all
at
once
i
truly
have
also
i
help
you
if
i
can
that
just
it
nan
you
can
help
me
this
time
and
i
going
to
tell
you
all
about
it
before
i
start
in
going
to
tell
me
now
yes
because
i
go
this
afternoon
go
where
that
just
it
i
go
to
take
a
position
as
a
companion
to
an
elderly
lady
and
i
shall
stay
a
week
i
take
some
clothes
in
a
suitcase
or
small
trunk
and
after
i
gone
you
must
tell
father
and
make
it
all
right
with
him
but
patty
he
said
at
the
outset
you
must
be
home
by
five
every
day
whatever
you
were
doing
yes
but
that
referred
to
occupations
by
the
day
now
that
i
decided
to
take
this
sort
of
a
position
which
is
really
more
appropriate
to
a
lady
of
my
standing
you
must
explain
to
him
that
i
ca
come
home
at
five
because
i
have
to
stay
all
the
time
nights
and
all
patty
you
crazy
no
i
not
i
determined
i
even
stubborn
if
you
like
but
so
that
settled
now
you
said
you
help
me
are
you
going
to
back
out
no
i
not
but
i
ca
approve
of
it
oh
you
can
if
you
try
hard
enough
just
think
how
much
properer
it
is
for
me
to
be
companion
to
a
lovely
lady
in
her
own
house
than
to
be
racing
around
lower
broadway
for
patchwork
that
so
said
nan
and
then
she
realised
that
if
she
knew
where
patty
was
going
they
could
go
and
bring
her
home
at
any
time
if
fairfield
wished
well
she
went
on
who
your
lovely
lady
van
reypen
patty
fairfield
not
van
reypen
yes
the
very
one
is
it
gay
she
a
bit
eccentric
and
she
advertised
for
a
companion
saying
the
application
must
be
a
written
one
so
i
pranced
up
to
her
house
this
morning
and
secured
the
position
but
she
said
to
apply
by
letter
yes
that
why
i
went
myself
i
sent
up
my
card
and
a
message
that
i
had
come
in
answer
to
her
advertisement
she
sent
back
word
that
i
could
go
home
and
write
to
her
i
said
i
write
then
and
there
so
i
helped
myself
to
her
library
desk
and
wrote
out
a
regular
application
in
less
than
five
minutes
i
was
summoned
to
her
august
presence
and
after
looking
me
over
she
engaged
me
at
once
how
that
for
quick
action
but
does
she
know
who
you
are
why
she
knows
my
name
and
that
all
but
she
a
why
she
sort
of
an
institution
yes
i
know
she
a
public
benefactor
and
all
that
but
really
very
interesting
though
i
fancy
she
has
a
quick
temper
however
made
the
agreement
for
a
week
then
if
either
of
us
wants
to
back
out
we
at
liberty
to
do
so
she
was
willing
to
arrange
it
that
way
she
insisted
on
it
she
never
takes
anybody
until
after
a
week
trial
what
are
your
duties
oh
almost
nothing
i
not
a
social
secretary
or
anything
like
that
merely
a
companion
to
be
with
her
and
read
to
her
occasionally
or
perhaps
sing
to
her
and
go
to
drive
with
her
and
that
about
all
no
one
else
in
the
family
i
do
think
so
she
did
speak
of
any
one
except
her
secretary
and
servants
she
rather
and
the
house
is
dear
all
crystal
chandeliers
and
old
frescoed
walls
and
ceilings
and
elaborate
why
nan
it
be
fun
to
be
there
a
week
and
so
well
so
safe
and
pleasant
you
know
and
so
correct
and
seemly
why
if
i
really
had
to
earn
my
own
living
i
could
do
better
than
to
be
companion
to
van
reypen
no
i
suppose
not
what
is
the
salary
ah
that
the
beauty
of
it
it
just
fifteen
dollars
a
week
and
as
i
get
and
lodging
beside
i
really
doing
better
than
i
agreed
to
i
do
like
it
patty
said
nan
after
a
few
moments
thought
but
it
better
in
some
ways
than
the
other
things
you
done
go
on
and
i
truly
do
all
i
can
to
talk
your
father
into
letting
you
stay
there
a
week
but
if
he
wo
consent
i
ca
help
it
why
of
course
he
consent
nan
if
you
put
it
to
him
right
you
can
make
him
see
anything
as
you
see
it
if
you
try
you
know
you
can
well
go
ahead
i
suppose
a
week
will
pass
and
anyway
you
probably
come
flying
home
after
a
couple
of
days
no
i
going
to
stay
the
week
if
it
finishes
me
i
tired
of
defeats
this
time
i
conquer
you
may
help
me
pack
if
you
like
you
wo
need
many
frocks
will
you
said
nan
as
they
went
up
to
patty
room
no
just
some
light
dressy
things
for
evening
she
rather
formal
and
some
plain
morning
gowns
nan
helped
patty
with
her
selection
and
a
small
trunk
was
filled
with
what
they
considered
an
appropriate
wardrobe
for
a
companion
at
about
four
patty
started
in
the
van
reypen
received
her
pleasantly
and
as
they
sat
chatting
over
a
cup
of
tea
patty
felt
more
like
an
honoured
guest
than
a
subordinate
then
van
reypen
dismissed
her
saying
go
to
your
room
now
my
dear
and
occupy
yourself
as
you
choose
until
dinner
is
at
seven
there
will
be
no
guests
but
you
will
wear
a
light
pretty
gown
if
you
please
i
am
punctilious
in
such
matters
patty
went
to
her
room
greatly
pleased
with
the
turn
events
had
taken
she
wished
she
could
telephone
home
how
pleasantly
she
was
getting
along
but
she
thought
wiser
not
to
do
that
so
soon
as
it
neared
she
put
on
one
of
her
prettiest
dresses
a
light
blue
chiffon
with
a
touch
of
silver
embroidery
round
the
throat
and
short
sleeves
a
few
minutes
before
seven
she
went
slowly
down
the
dark
old
staircase
with
its
massive
newels
and
balusters
as
she
reached
the
middle
steps
she
observed
an
attractive
but
young
man
in
the
hall
he
had
not
noticed
her
light
steps
and
patty
paused
a
moment
to
look
at
him
as
she
stood
wondering
who
he
might
be
he
chanced
to
turn
and
saw
her
the
young
man
ran
his
eyes
swiftly
from
the
cloud
of
blue
chiffon
up
to
the
smiling
face
with
its
crown
of
massed
golden
hair
which
a
saucy
bow
of
blue
ribbon
did
its
best
to
hold
in
place
his
face
promptly
lost
its
bored
expression
and
with
his
hands
still
in
his
pockets
he
involuntarily
breathed
a
long
low
whistle
the
sound
seemed
to
bring
back
his
lost
wits
and
quickly
drawing
his
hands
into
view
he
stepped
forward
saying
i
beg
your
pardon
for
that
unconventional
note
of
admiration
but
i
trust
you
will
accept
it
as
the
tribute
for
which
it
was
meant
this
was
an
easy
opening
and
patty
was
quite
ready
to
respond
gaily
when
she
suddenly
remembered
her
position
in
the
house
and
wondered
if
a
companion
ought
to
speak
to
a
strange
young
man
in
the
same
language
a
young
person
in
society
might
use
thank
you
she
said
uncertainly
and
her
shy
hesitation
completely
captured
the
heart
of
philip
van
reypen
come
on
down
i
wo
eat
you
he
said
reassuringly
you
are
i
assume
a
guest
of
my
aunt
i
am
van
reypen
companion
said
patty
but
though
she
made
the
announcement
demurely
enough
the
funny
side
of
it
all
struck
her
so
forcibly
that
she
had
difficulty
to
keep
the
corners
of
her
mouth
from
showing
her
amusement
by
jove
exclaimed
the
young
man
aunty
van
always
is
lucky
now
her
nephew
does
that
prove
her
good
luck
said
patty
unable
to
be
prim
in
the
face
of
this
light
gaiety
yes
indeed
come
on
down
and
get
acquainted
and
you
agree
with
me
i
do
believe
i
ought
to
said
patty
hesitatingly
placing
one
little
foot
on
the
next
step
below
and
then
pausing
again
you
see
i
never
been
a
companion
before
but
i
do
think
it
right
for
me
to
precede
van
reypen
into
the
ah
well
perhaps
not
stay
on
the
stairs
then
if
you
think
that
the
proper
place
i
daresay
it
is
i
never
was
a
companion
either
so
not
sure
but
sit
down
wo
you
i
sit
here
if
i
may
young
van
reypen
dropped
onto
a
stair
a
few
steps
below
patty
who
sat
down
too
feeling
decidedly
at
her
ease
for
upon
occasion
a
staircase
was
one
of
her
favourite
haunts
it
like
a
party
she
said
smiling
i
love
to
sit
on
a
staircase
at
a
party
do
you
and
so
provocative
of
sociability
did
the
staircase
prove
that
when
van
reypen
came
down
in
all
the
glory
of
her
black
velvet
and
old
lace
she
nearly
tumbled
over
two
chatting
young
people
who
seemed
to
be
very
good
friends
philip
you
here
she
exclaimed
and
a
casual
observer
would
have
said
she
was
not
too
well
pleased
yes
aunty
van
are
you
as
glad
to
see
me
as
i
am
to
see
you
been
making
miss
fairfield
acquaintance
you
may
introduce
us
if
you
like
but
it
is
really
necessary
so
it
seems
said
the
old
lady
drily
but
as
i
have
some
regard
for
the
conventions
i
will
present
to
you
miss
fairfield
my
and
nephew
philip
van
reypen
what
an
awful
reputation
to
live
up
to
said
patty
smiling
at
the
debonair
philip
who
quite
looked
the
part
his
aunt
assigned
to
him
awful
but
not
at
all
difficult
he
responded
gaily
and
patty
followed
as
he
escorted
his
aunt
to
the
the
little
was
a
gay
one
van
reypen
became
mildly
amiable
under
the
influence
of
the
young
people
merry
chatter
and
patty
felt
that
so
far
at
least
a
companion
lot
was
not
such
a
very
unhappy
one
after
dinner
however
the
young
man
was
sent
peremptorily
away
he
begged
to
stay
but
his
aunt
ordered
him
off
declaring
that
she
had
seen
enough
of
him
and
he
was
not
to
return
for
a
week
at
least
philip
went
away
sulkily
declaring
that
he
would
call
the
very
next
morning
to
inquire
after
his
aunt
health
i
trust
you
are
not
flirtatiously
inclined
miss
fairfield
said
van
reypen
as
the
two
sat
alone
in
the
large
and
rather
sombre
i
am
not
said
patty
honestly
i
like
gay
and
merry
conversation
but
as
your
companion
i
consider
myself
entirely
at
your
orders
and
have
no
mind
to
chatter
if
you
do
not
wish
me
to
do
so
that
is
right
said
van
reypen
approvingly
you
can
not
have
many
friends
in
your
present
position
of
course
and
you
must
not
feel
flattered
at
philip
apparent
admiration
of
you
he
is
a
most
impressionable
youth
and
is
caught
by
every
new
face
he
sees
patty
smiled
at
the
idea
of
her
being
unduly
impressed
by
van
reypen
glances
she
had
given
him
no
thought
save
as
a
young
man
but
she
pleasantly
assured
van
reypen
that
she
would
give
her
nephew
no
further
consideration
and
though
van
reypen
looked
sharply
at
patty
face
she
saw
only
an
honest
desire
to
please
her
employer
the
evening
was
long
and
uninteresting
at
van
reypen
request
patty
read
to
her
and
then
sang
for
her
but
the
lady
was
critical
and
declared
that
the
reading
was
too
fast
and
the
singing
too
loud
so
that
when
at
last
it
was
bedtime
patty
wondered
whether
she
was
giving
satisfaction
or
not
but
she
was
engaged
for
a
week
anyway
and
whether
satisfactory
or
not
van
reypen
must
keep
her
for
that
length
of
time
and
that
was
all
patty
wanted
she
woke
next
morning
with
a
pang
of
homesickness
it
was
a
bit
forlorn
to
wake
up
as
a
hired
companion
instead
of
as
a
beloved
daughter
in
her
own
father
house
but
resolutely
putting
aside
such
thoughts
she
forced
herself
to
think
of
her
good
fortune
in
securing
her
present
position
i
glad
i
here
she
assured
herself
as
she
dashed
cold
water
into
her
suspiciously
reddened
eyes
i
know
i
shall
have
all
sorts
of
odd
and
interesting
adventures
here
and
i
determined
to
be
happy
whatever
happens
and
anyway
it
will
be
over
soon
a
week
is
long
putting
on
a
trim
morning
dress
of
soft
old
rose
cashmere
with
a
fine
embroidered
white
yoke
she
went
sedately
down
to
the
breakfast
room
she
had
been
told
to
come
to
breakfast
at
nine
and
the
clock
struck
the
hour
just
as
she
crossed
the
threshold
instead
of
her
employer
she
was
astounded
to
see
philip
van
reypen
calmly
seated
at
the
table
jolly
to
see
you
again
he
cried
as
he
jumped
up
to
greet
her
just
thought
i
run
in
for
a
bite
of
breakfast
and
to
inquire
how
aunty
van
cold
is
i
did
know
she
had
a
cold
said
patty
primly
trying
to
act
as
she
thought
a
companion
ought
to
act
neither
did
i
said
the
irrepressible
philip
but
i
did
know
but
she
might
have
caught
one
in
the
night
a
germ
flying
in
at
the
window
or
something
mindful
of
van
reypen
admonitions
patty
tried
not
to
appear
interested
in
the
young
man
remarks
but
it
was
impossible
to
ignore
the
fact
that
he
was
interested
in
her
she
responded
to
his
gay
banter
in
monosyllables
and
kept
her
dancing
eyes
veiled
by
their
own
lids
but
this
only
served
to
pique
philip
curiosity
i
a
notion
to
spend
the
day
here
with
aunty
van
he
said
and
then
patty
glanced
up
at
him
in
positive
alarm
do
she
cried
and
her
face
betokened
a
genuine
distress
why
not
said
the
surprised
young
man
have
you
learned
to
dislike
me
so
cordially
already
amiable
patty
could
stand
for
this
misinterpretation
of
her
attitude
and
her
involuntary
smiling
glance
was
a
sufficient
disclaimer
but
she
was
saved
the
necessity
of
a
verbal
reply
for
just
at
that
moment
van
reypen
came
into
the
room
chapter
xv
persistent
philip
why
philip
van
reypen
exclaimed
you
are
indeed
growing
attentive
to
your
aged
aunt
aunt
he
returned
gallantly
and
belonging
to
the
early
at
that
i
told
you
i
should
call
this
morning
and
i
like
another
egg
please
aunty
you
may
have
all
the
eggs
you
want
but
i
am
not
at
all
pleased
with
your
presence
here
after
i
expressly
forbade
it
oh
it
is
a
crime
to
call
on
one
own
aunt
is
it
it
extremely
rude
i
have
a
busy
day
before
me
and
i
do
want
a
bothersome
nephew
around
van
reypen
was
exceedingly
fond
of
philip
and
loved
to
have
him
at
her
house
but
it
was
easy
to
be
seen
now
that
she
considered
him
far
too
much
interested
in
pretty
patty
and
partly
because
he
was
interested
and
partly
to
tease
his
aunt
the
young
man
declared
his
intention
of
spending
the
day
with
them
i
ca
have
you
philip
said
van
reypen
decidedly
i
want
you
to
go
away
immediately
after
breakfast
just
my
luck
grumbled
her
nephew
i
never
can
do
anything
i
want
to
well
i
go
downtown
but
i
be
back
here
to
luncheon
do
talk
nonsense
said
van
reypen
shortly
you
do
nothing
of
the
sort
the
rest
of
the
meal
was
not
very
enjoyable
van
reypen
was
clearly
displeased
at
her
nephew
presence
patty
did
not
think
it
wise
to
take
any
active
part
in
the
conversation
and
though
philip
was
in
gay
spirits
it
was
not
easy
to
be
merry
alone
patty
could
help
smiling
at
his
audacious
speeches
but
she
kept
her
eyes
down
on
her
plate
and
endeavoured
to
ignore
the
young
presence
for
she
knew
this
was
what
reypen
wished
her
to
do
now
you
may
go
said
the
hostess
as
philip
finished
his
egg
i
like
to
enjoy
a
cup
of
coffee
in
peace
oh
i
peaceful
declared
philip
crossing
his
hands
on
his
breast
and
rolling
up
his
eyes
with
an
angelic
expression
philip
said
his
aunt
so
icily
that
the
young
man
rose
from
the
table
and
stalked
out
of
the
room
now
said
van
reypen
we
are
rid
of
him
but
in
a
few
moments
the
smiling
face
again
appeared
at
the
door
i
forgot
to
say
to
miss
fairfield
he
announced
cheerfully
may
i
do
that
aunty
van
reypen
gave
an
annoyed
humph
and
patty
taking
her
cue
bowed
very
coldly
and
said
van
reypen
in
an
utterly
impersonal
tone
philip
chuckled
and
went
away
slamming
the
street
door
behind
him
as
a
final
annoyance
to
his
aunt
you
must
think
him
a
rude
boy
miss
fairfield
she
said
but
he
delights
to
tease
me
and
unless
i
am
positively
cross
to
him
he
never
lets
up
but
he
is
really
devoted
to
me
and
i
assure
you
he
scarcely
noted
your
presence
at
all
of
course
not
said
patty
with
great
difficulty
restraining
a
burst
of
laughter
no
one
could
dream
of
philip
van
reypen
observing
a
companion
patty
did
not
mean
this
for
sarcasm
she
desired
only
to
set
van
reypen
mind
at
rest
and
then
the
subject
of
philip
was
dropped
soon
after
breakfast
van
reypen
conducted
patty
to
a
pleasant
morning
room
and
asked
her
to
read
the
newspaper
aloud
and
do
try
to
read
slower
she
added
i
hate
rapid
gabbling
patty
had
resolved
not
to
take
offence
at
the
brusque
remarks
which
she
knew
would
be
hurled
at
her
so
somewhat
meekly
she
took
up
the
paper
and
began
it
was
a
trying
task
if
she
read
an
account
of
anything
unpleasant
she
was
peremptorily
stopped
if
the
news
was
dry
or
prosy
that
was
also
cut
off
short
read
me
the
fashion
notes
said
van
reypen
at
last
so
patty
read
a
whole
page
about
the
latest
modes
and
her
hearer
was
greatly
interested
she
then
told
patty
of
some
new
gowns
she
was
having
made
and
seemed
pleased
at
patty
intelligent
comments
on
them
why
you
have
good
taste
she
exclaimed
as
if
making
a
surprising
discovery
i
will
take
you
with
me
this
afternoon
when
i
go
to
madame
leval
to
try
on
my
gowns
very
well
said
patty
and
now
van
reypen
i
sure
nothing
more
of
interest
in
the
paper
what
shall
i
do
next
heavens
miss
fairfield
do
ask
such
a
question
as
that
you
are
here
to
entertain
me
i
am
not
to
provide
amusement
for
you
why
do
you
suppose
i
have
you
here
if
not
to
make
my
time
pass
pleasantly
patty
was
bewildered
at
this
outburst
though
she
knew
her
duties
would
be
light
she
supposed
they
would
be
clearly
defined
and
not
left
to
her
own
invention
but
she
was
anxious
to
please
and
she
said
pleasantly
i
think
that
really
what
i
meant
but
i
did
express
myself
very
well
and
you
see
i
do
yet
quite
know
your
tastes
do
you
like
fancy
work
i
know
a
lovely
new
crochet
stitch
i
could
show
you
no
i
hate
crocheting
the
wool
gets
all
snarled
up
and
the
pattern
gets
wrong
every
few
stitches
then
we
dismiss
that
do
you
like
to
play
cards
i
know
cribbage
and
some
other
games
that
two
can
play
no
i
detest
cards
i
think
it
is
very
foolish
to
sit
and
fumble
with
bits
of
painted
pasteboard
poor
patty
was
at
her
wits
end
she
had
not
expected
to
be
a
professional
entertainer
and
she
did
know
what
to
suggest
next
she
felt
sure
van
reypen
would
care
to
listen
to
any
more
reading
just
then
she
hesitated
to
propose
music
as
it
had
not
been
very
successful
the
night
before
on
a
sudden
impulse
she
said
do
you
like
to
see
dancing
i
can
do
some
pretty
fancy
dances
it
seemed
an
absurd
thing
to
say
but
patty
had
ransacked
her
brain
to
think
what
professional
entertainers
did
and
that
was
all
she
could
think
of
except
recitations
and
those
she
hated
herself
yes
i
do
cried
van
reypen
so
emphatically
that
patty
jumped
i
love
to
see
dancing
if
you
can
do
it
which
i
doubt
i
wish
you
would
dance
for
me
and
this
evening
we
go
to
see
that
new
dancer
that
the
town
is
wild
over
if
you
really
can
dance
you
appreciate
it
as
i
do
to
me
dancing
is
a
fine
art
and
should
be
considered
so
but
it
rarely
is
do
you
require
music
of
course
i
prefer
it
but
i
can
dance
without
we
try
it
without
first
then
if
i
wish
to
i
ask
delia
my
to
play
for
you
she
plays
fairly
well
or
if
it
suits
me
i
may
play
myself
patty
made
no
response
to
these
suggestions
but
followed
van
reypen
to
the
great
at
one
end
of
which
was
a
grand
piano
try
it
without
music
first
was
the
order
and
patty
walked
to
the
other
end
of
the
long
room
while
van
reypen
seated
herself
on
a
sofa
serenely
conscious
of
her
proficiency
in
the
art
patty
felt
no
embarrassment
and
swaying
gently
as
if
listening
to
rhythm
she
began
a
pretty
little
fancy
dance
that
she
had
learned
some
years
ago
she
danced
beautifully
and
she
loved
to
dance
so
she
made
a
most
effective
picture
as
she
pirouetted
back
and
forth
or
from
side
to
side
of
the
long
room
beautiful
said
van
reypen
as
patty
paused
in
front
of
her
and
bowed
you
are
a
charming
dancer
i
do
know
when
i
enjoyed
anything
so
much
are
you
tired
will
you
dance
again
i
not
at
all
tired
said
patty
i
like
to
dance
and
i
very
glad
it
pleases
you
can
you
do
a
minuet
asked
the
old
lady
after
patty
had
finished
another
dance
a
gay
little
spanish
fandango
yes
but
i
like
music
for
that
good
i
will
play
myself
with
great
dignity
van
reypen
rose
and
walked
to
the
piano
patty
adjusted
the
for
her
and
she
ran
her
delicate
old
fingers
lightly
over
the
keys
i
sadly
out
of
practice
she
said
but
i
can
play
a
tinkling
minuet
and
you
may
dance
to
it
she
began
a
melodious
little
air
and
patty
after
listening
a
moment
nodded
her
head
and
ran
to
take
her
place
van
reypen
was
so
seated
at
the
piano
that
she
could
watch
dance
and
in
a
moment
the
two
were
in
harmony
and
patty
was
gliding
and
bowing
in
a
charming
minuet
while
van
reypen
played
in
perfect
sympathy
the
dance
was
nearly
over
when
patty
discovered
the
smiling
face
of
philip
van
reypen
in
the
doorway
his
aunt
could
not
see
him
and
patty
saw
only
his
reflection
in
the
mirror
he
gave
her
a
pleading
glance
and
put
his
finger
on
his
lip
entreating
her
silence
so
she
went
on
without
seeming
to
see
him
but
she
wondered
what
his
aunt
would
say
after
the
dance
was
over
indeed
the
funny
side
of
the
situation
struck
her
so
forcibly
that
she
unconsciously
smiled
broadly
at
her
own
thoughts
that
right
said
van
reypen
as
the
dancing
and
music
both
came
to
an
end
i
am
glad
to
see
you
smile
as
you
dance
i
have
seen
some
dancers
who
look
positively
agonised
as
they
do
difficult
steps
patty
smiled
again
remembering
that
she
had
had
a
reason
to
smile
as
she
danced
and
she
wondered
why
philip
did
appear
but
he
did
and
except
that
she
had
seen
him
so
clearly
in
the
mirror
and
he
had
asked
her
silently
but
unmistakably
not
to
divulge
the
fact
of
his
presence
she
would
have
thought
she
only
imagined
him
there
in
the
doorway
you
dance
wonderfully
well
went
on
van
reypen
you
have
had
very
good
training
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
dance
for
me
often
but
and
please
remember
this
never
when
any
one
else
is
here
i
wish
you
to
dance
for
me
only
if
i
have
guests
or
if
my
nephew
is
here
you
are
not
to
dance
this
was
almost
too
much
for
patty
gravity
for
she
well
knew
the
old
lady
was
foolishly
alarmed
lest
her
nephew
should
fall
in
love
with
a
humble
companion
and
knowing
that
the
said
nephew
had
gleefully
watched
the
dance
it
was
difficult
not
to
show
her
amusement
but
she
only
said
i
will
remember
van
reypen
she
could
tell
of
the
intruder
after
his
frantic
appeal
to
her
for
silence
so
she
determined
to
ignore
the
episode
now
you
may
do
as
you
like
until
luncheon
time
said
van
reypen
for
i
shall
go
to
my
room
and
lie
down
for
a
rest
my
maid
will
attend
me
so
i
will
bid
you
adieu
until
one
wander
round
the
house
if
you
choose
you
will
find
much
to
interest
you
right
you
are
thought
patty
to
herself
i
do
believe
i
have
to
wander
far
to
find
a
jolly
comrade
to
interest
me
but
she
well
knew
if
philip
van
reypen
was
still
in
the
house
and
if
she
should
encounter
him
and
chat
with
him
it
would
greatly
enrage
the
old
lady
and
thought
patty
since
i
made
good
with
my
dancing
it
a
shame
to
spoil
my
record
by
talking
to
sir
philip
but
he
is
pleasant
determined
to
do
her
duty
she
went
straight
to
her
own
room
though
tempted
to
wander
round
the
house
and
sure
enough
though
she
did
know
it
van
reypen
was
watching
her
from
behind
the
draperies
his
face
fell
as
he
saw
her
go
up
the
stairs
and
though
he
waited
some
time
she
did
not
return
saucy
puss
he
thought
but
i
have
a
chat
with
her
yet
going
to
the
library
he
scribbled
a
note
and
sent
it
by
a
servant
to
miss
fairfield
room
the
note
said
do
come
down
and
talk
to
a
lonely
neglected
waif
if
only
for
a
few
minutes
patty
laughed
as
she
read
it
but
she
only
said
to
the
maid
who
brought
it
please
say
to
van
reypen
that
there
is
no
answer
the
maid
departed
but
in
less
than
ten
minutes
returned
with
another
note
you
afraid
of
aunty
van
come
on
i
will
protect
you
just
for
a
few
moments
chat
on
the
stairs
again
patty
sent
the
message
there
is
no
answer
soon
came
a
third
note
i
think
you
are
horrid
and
you
do
dance
prettily
at
all
oho
thought
patty
getting
saucy
is
he
she
made
no
response
whatever
to
the
maid
this
time
but
she
was
not
greatly
surprised
when
another
note
came
if
you
do
come
down
i
going
out
to
drown
myself
patty
began
to
be
annoyed
the
servants
must
think
all
this
very
strange
and
yet
surely
she
could
not
help
it
wait
a
moment
delia
she
said
please
say
to
van
reypen
that
i
will
see
him
in
the
library
at
once
after
a
moment
she
followed
the
maid
downstairs
and
went
straight
to
the
library
where
the
young
man
awaited
her
his
face
lighted
up
with
gladness
as
he
held
out
his
hand
forgive
me
if
i
was
impertinent
he
said
with
such
a
charming
air
of
apology
that
patty
had
to
smile
i
forgive
the
impertinence
she
returned
but
you
are
making
real
trouble
for
me
what
do
you
mean
he
cried
looking
dismayed
i
mean
that
i
am
your
aunt
companion
and
trying
to
earn
my
living
thereby
now
if
you
persist
in
secretly
coming
to
the
house
pardon
me
if
i
am
frank
and
if
you
persist
in
sending
foolish
notes
to
me
your
aunt
will
not
let
me
stay
here
and
i
shall
lose
a
good
position
through
your
unkindness
patty
was
very
much
in
earnest
and
her
words
were
sincere
but
her
innate
sense
of
humour
could
fail
to
see
the
ridiculous
side
of
it
all
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
dimpled
though
she
kept
her
eyes
resolutely
cast
down
it
a
shame
the
way
she
keeps
you
tied
to
her
apron
string
he
blurted
out
uncertain
whether
patty
was
coquetting
or
really
distressed
not
at
all
she
replied
i
here
to
attend
on
her
pleasure
and
my
place
is
by
her
side
whenever
she
wants
me
there
how
can
any
one
help
wanting
you
there
broke
out
philip
so
explosively
that
patty
instead
of
being
offended
burst
into
a
ringing
laugh
oh
you
are
too
funny
she
exclaimed
van
reypen
said
you
were
given
to
saying
things
like
that
to
everybody
i
do
say
them
to
everybody
yes
you
do
your
aunt
says
so
but
now
that
you
said
it
to
me
you
go
away
and
stay
away
how
long
patty
thought
quickly
till
next
friday
a
week
from
oh
you
want
to
get
acclimatised
all
by
yourself
yes
said
patty
demurely
i
do
and
if
you
only
keep
away
you
know
your
aunt
asked
you
not
to
come
back
for
a
week
if
you
keep
away
till
next
friday
i
never
ask
you
another
favour
huh
that
no
inducement
i
love
to
have
you
ask
me
favours
well
then
i
never
shall
if
you
do
grant
this
first
one
and
if
i
do
if
you
do
i
promise
you
almost
anything
you
ask
that
a
large
order
well
if
i
stay
away
from
this
house
until
you
get
solid
with
aunty
van
i
said
a
week
well
friday
if
i
stay
away
a
week
will
you
persuade
aunty
to
invite
me
to
dinner
next
friday
night
i
will
can
you
persuade
her
to
do
that
i
sure
i
can
by
that
time
patty
eyes
were
dancing
she
had
come
to
van
reypen
on
thursday
she
would
therefore
leave
on
thursday
and
she
was
sure
that
lady
would
have
no
objections
to
inviting
her
nephew
to
dinner
after
her
companion
departure
are
you
going
to
stay
demanded
philip
suspiciously
i
here
a
week
on
trial
said
patty
demurely
your
aunt
need
keep
me
longer
if
i
do
suit
her
and
i
know
i
wo
suit
her
if
she
thinks
i
receive
notes
from
her
nephew
oh
i
see
you
here
a
week
on
trial
and
if
i
am
chummy
with
you
aunty
van
wo
keep
you
oh
yes
why
of
course
to
be
sure
well
miss
fairfield
i
make
this
sacrifice
for
your
benefit
i
will
keep
away
from
here
during
your
trial
week
then
in
return
you
promise
to
use
your
influence
to
get
me
an
invitation
to
dine
here
next
friday
i
do
returned
patty
but
do
you
need
an
invitation
to
a
house
where
you
seem
to
feel
so
much
at
home
only
when
you
in
it
declared
the
young
man
frankly
i
think
aunty
van
fears
i
mean
to
kidnap
you
i
do
i
sure
you
do
said
patty
flashing
a
smile
at
him
i
think
we
could
be
good
friends
and
i
hope
we
shall
be
but
not
until
after
next
friday
chapter
xvi
an
invitation
declined
philip
van
reypen
went
away
and
his
aunt
never
knew
that
he
had
been
to
her
house
on
that
occasion
i
glad
that
boy
has
sense
enough
to
keep
away
when
i
tell
him
to
she
remarked
at
luncheon
and
patty
hastily
took
a
sip
of
water
to
hide
her
uncontrollable
smile
yes
he
seems
to
obey
you
she
said
by
way
of
being
agreeable
he
does
he
a
good
boy
but
too
impressionable
he
captivated
by
every
girl
he
meets
so
i
warn
you
again
miss
fairfield
not
to
notice
his
pretended
interest
in
you
patty
tossed
her
head
a
little
haughtily
do
not
be
alarmed
van
reypen
she
said
i
have
no
interest
whatever
in
your
nephew
she
was
a
little
annoyed
at
the
absurd
speeches
of
the
old
lady
and
determined
to
put
a
stop
to
them
i
should
hope
not
was
the
reply
a
person
in
your
position
should
not
aspire
to
association
with
young
gentlemen
like
my
nephew
patty
was
really
angry
at
this
but
her
common
sense
came
to
her
aid
if
she
elected
to
play
the
part
of
a
dependent
she
must
accept
the
consequences
but
she
allowed
herself
a
pointed
rejoinder
perhaps
not
she
said
yet
i
suppose
a
companion
of
van
would
meet
only
the
best
people
that
of
course
but
you
can
not
meet
them
as
an
equal
no
agreed
patty
meekly
then
to
herself
she
said
only
a
week
of
this
only
six
days
now
that
afternoon
they
went
to
the
dressmaker
patty
put
on
a
smart
tailored
costume
and
almost
regretted
that
she
had
left
her
white
furs
at
home
but
she
and
nan
had
agreed
that
they
were
too
elaborate
for
her
use
as
a
companion
so
she
wore
a
small
neckpiece
and
muff
of
chinchilla
but
it
suited
well
her
cloth
suit
and
plain
but
chic
black
velvet
hat
the
dressmaker
an
modiste
looked
at
patty
with
interest
recognising
in
her
costume
the
work
of
adept
hands
moreover
patty
praise
and
criticism
of
van
reypen
new
gowns
showed
her
to
be
a
young
woman
of
taste
and
knowledge
in
such
matters
both
the
modiste
and
her
aristocratic
patron
were
a
little
puzzled
at
patty
attitude
which
though
modest
and
deferential
was
yet
sure
and
true
in
its
judgments
and
opinions
at
last
when
van
reypen
was
undergoing
some
tedious
fitting
patty
had
an
inspiration
may
i
be
excused
long
enough
to
telephone
she
asked
certainly
said
van
reypen
who
was
in
high
good
humour
because
of
her
new
finery
take
all
the
time
you
like
patty
had
noticed
a
telephone
booth
in
the
hall
and
shutting
herself
in
it
she
called
up
nan
by
good
fortune
nan
was
at
home
and
answered
at
once
oh
began
patty
giggling
i
so
much
to
tell
you
and
it
all
so
funny
i
ca
say
a
word

at
the
dressmaker
now
and
i
took
this
chance
to
call
you
up
because
i
wo
be
overheard
oh
nan
it
great
fun

me

principal
facts

and
stop
giggling

she
kind

she
patronising

you
a
pleasant
room

you
want
to
come
home

you
happy
there
oh
nan
wait
a
minute

goodness
sake
yes
she
patronising
she
wo
let
me
speak
to
her
grand
nephew
oh
i
do
mean
her
grand
nephew
i
mean
her
grand
gorgeous
extraordinary
nephew
but
i

and
never
mind
about
him
anyway

nan
it
seems
as
if
i

away
from
home

year
and
what
do
you
think
i
have
to
dance
for
her
to
amuse
her
patty
not
really
well

do
that
all
right
sure
i
can
oh
she
a
peach
do
reprove
my
slang
nan
i
have
to
be
so
precise
when

duty

i
must
say
now
i
write
you
a
long
letter
as
soon
as
i

a
chance

to

mlle
thingamajig

and

the
opera
so
you

i
not
dull
oh
patty
i
wish
you
drop
it
all
and
come
home
i
do
like
it
and
fred
does
either
all
be
over
soon
only
six
days
more
expect
me
home
next
thursday
afternoon
love
to
all
patty
patty
hung
up
the
receiver
for
she
knew
if
she
talked
any
longer
get
homesick
the
sound
of
nan
familiar
voice
made
her
long
for
her
home
and
her
people
but
patty
was
plucky
and
also
she
was
doggedly
determined
to
succeed
this
time
so
she
went
back
to
van
reypen
with
a
placid
countenance
and
sat
for
an
hour
or
more
complimenting
and
admiring
the
costumes
in
process
of
construction
somehow
the
afternoon
dragged
itself
away
and
the
evening
at
the
theatre
passed
pleasantly
enough
but
the
succeeding
days
went
slowly
van
reypen
was
difficult
to
please
she
was
fretty
irritable
inconsequent
and
unjust
what
suited
her
one
day
displeased
her
highly
the
next
so
long
as
patty
praised
complimented
and
flattered
her
all
went
fairly
well
but
if
patty
inadvertently
disagreed
with
her
or
expressed
a
contrary
opinion
there
was
a
scene
and
again
if
patty
seemed
especially
meek
and
mild
van
reypen
would
say
do
sit
there
and
assent
to
everything
i
say
do
have
some
mind
of
your
own
express
an
honest
opinion
even
though
it
may
differ
from
mine
then
if
patty
did
this
it
would
bring
down
vials
of
wrath
on
her
inoffensive
head
often
she
was
at
her
wits
end
to
know
what
to
say
but
her
sense
of
humour
never
deserted
her
and
if
she
said
something
feeling
sure
she
was
going
to
get
sorely
berated
for
saying
it
she
was
able
to
smile
inwardly
when
the
scathing
retort
was
uttered
sunday
was
an
especially
hard
day
it
was
stormy
so
they
could
not
go
out
so
van
reypen
bade
patty
read
sermons
to
her
when
patty
did
so
she
either
fell
asleep
and
then
waking
suddenly
declared
that
patty
had
been
skipping
or
else
she
argued
contrary
to
the
doctrines
expressed
in
the
sermons
and
expected
patty
to
combat
her
arguments
i
tired
of
hearing
you
read
she
said
at
last
you
do
read
abominably
first
you
go
along
in
staccato
jerks
then
you
drone
in
a
monotone
philip
is
a
fine
reader
i
love
to
hear
philip
read
i
wish
he
come
in
i
wonder
why
he
does
probably
because
here
he
must
have
taken
a
violent
dislike
to
you
miss
fairfield
do
you
think
so
said
patty
almost
choking
with
suppressed
laughter
at
this
version
of
philip
attitude
toward
her
yes
i
sure
he
did
for
usually
he
likes
my
companions
especially
if
they
pretty
and
you
pretty
miss
fairfield
not
the
type
i
admire
myself
i
prefer
brunettes
but
still
you
are
pretty
in
your
own
way
thank
you
said
patty
meekly
and
you
especially
pretty
when
you
dance
i
wish
you
could
dance
for
me
now
but
of
course
i
would
let
you
dance
on
sunday
that
the
worst
of
sundays
there
so
little
one
can
do
shall
i
sing
hymns
to
you
inquired
patty
gently
for
she
really
felt
sorry
for
the
discontented
old
lady
yes
if
you
like
was
the
not
very
gracious
rejoinder
and
without
accompaniment
patty
sang
the
old
hymns
in
her
true
sweet
voice
the
twilight
was
falling
and
as
patty
soothing
music
continued
van
reypen
fell
asleep
in
her
chair
exhausted
by
a
really
difficult
day
patty
also
dropped
into
a
doze
and
the
two
slept
peacefully
in
their
chairs
in
front
of
the
dying
embers
of
the
wood
fire
it
was
thus
that
philip
van
reypen
found
them
as
he
came
softly
in
at
five
well
i
be
excused
he
said
to
himself
if
i
ever
saw
anything
to
beat
that
his
gaze
had
wandered
from
his
sleeping
aunt
to
patty
now
sound
asleep
in
a
big
armchair
the
crimson
velvet
made
a
perfect
background
for
her
golden
curls
a
bit
tumbled
by
her
afternoon
exertions
at
being
entertaining
her
posture
was
one
of
graceful
relaxation
and
pretty
patty
had
never
looked
prettier
than
she
did
then
asleep
in
the
faint
firelight
by
jove
exclaimed
the
young
man
but
not
aloud
if
that
is
the
prettiest
sight
ever
i
believe
there
a
tradition
that
one
may
kiss
a
lady
whom
one
finds
asleep
in
her
chair
but
i
wo
she
a
dear
little
girl
and
she
sha
be
teased
then
philip
van
reypen
deliberately
and
noiselessly
lifted
another
large
armchair
and
carefully
disposing
his
own
goodly
proportioned
frame
within
it
proceeded
to
fall
asleep
himself
or
if
not
really
asleep
he
gave
an
exceedingly
good
imitation
of
it
patty
woke
first
as
she
slowly
opened
her
eyes
she
saw
philip
dimly
through
the
now
rapidly
gathering
dusk
quick
as
a
flash
she
took
in
the
situation
and
shut
her
eyes
again
though
not
until
philip
had
seen
her
from
beneath
his
own
quivering
lids
after
a
time
she
peeped
again
why
play
he
whispered
what
about
your
promise
she
returned
also
under
her
breath
had
to
come
aunty
telephoned
for
me
oh
then
van
reypen
awoke
who
here
she
cried
out
oh
philip
you
she
heartily
kissed
her
nephew
and
then
rang
for
lights
and
tea
miss
fairfield
she
said
not
untimidly
but
with
decision
you
are
weary
and
i
not
surprised
at
it
go
to
your
room
and
rest
until
dinner
time
i
will
send
your
tea
to
you
there
yes
van
reypen
said
patty
demurely
and
with
a
slight
impersonal
bow
to
philip
she
left
the
room
oh
i
say
aunty
van
exclaimed
the
young
man
as
patty
disappeared
do
send
her
away
be
quiet
philip
said
his
aunt
you
know
you
do
like
her
and
she
needs
a
rest
do
like
her
echoed
philip
does
a
cat
like
cream
aunty
van
what
the
matter
with
you
anyway
who
is
she
she
my
companion
was
the
stern
response
my
hired
companion
and
i
do
not
wish
you
to
treat
her
as
an
equal
equal
she
superior
to
anything
i
ever
seen
yet
oh
you
rogue
you
say
that
or
its
equivalent
about
every
girl
you
meet
pooh
nonsense
but
i
say
aunty
she
come
down
to
dinner
she
yes
i
suppose
so
but
mind
now
philip
you
not
to
talk
to
her
as
if
she
were
of
your
own
class
no
i
wo
reassured
by
the
knowledge
that
he
should
see
her
again
philip
was
most
affable
and
agreeable
and
chatted
with
his
aunt
in
a
happy
frame
of
mind
patty
exiled
to
her
own
room
decided
to
write
to
nan
she
filled
several
sheets
with
accounts
of
her
doings
at
van
reypen
and
gloated
over
the
fact
that
there
were
now
but
four
days
of
her
week
left
i
shall
win
this
time
she
wrote
and
though
life
here
is
not
a
bed
of
roses
yet
it
is
not
so
very
bad
and
when
the
week
is
over
i
shall
look
back
at
it
with
lots
of
funny
thoughts
oh
nan
prepare
a
fatted
calf
for
thursday
night
for
i
shall
come
home
a
veritable
prodigal
son
of
course
i
do
mean
this
literally
we
have
lovely
things
to
eat
here
but
it
hame
fain
wad
i
be
i
wo
write
again
probably
get
no
chance
but
send
miller
for
me
at
four
on
thursday
afternoon
after
writing
the
letter
patty
felt
less
homesick
it
seemed
somehow
to
bring
thursday
nearer
to
write
about
it
she
began
to
dress
for
dinner
and
in
a
spirit
of
mischief
she
took
pains
to
make
a
most
fetching
toilette
her
frock
was
of
white
mousseline
de
soie
that
twinkled
into
foolish
little
ruffles
all
round
the
hem
more
tiny
frills
gambolled
around
the
circular
neck
and
nestled
against
patty
soft
round
arms
her
curly
hair
was
parted
and
massed
low
at
the
back
of
her
neck
and
behind
one
ear
she
tucked
a
pink
rosebud
the
long
dreamy
day
had
roused
in
patty
a
contrary
wilfulness
and
she
was
quite
ready
for
fun
if
any
came
her
way
at
dinner
van
reypen
monopolised
the
conversation
she
talked
mostly
to
philip
but
occasionally
addressed
a
remark
to
patty
she
was
exceedingly
polite
to
her
but
made
her
feel
that
her
share
of
the
conversation
must
be
formal
and
conventional
then
she
would
chatter
to
her
nephew
about
matters
unknown
to
patty
and
then
perhaps
again
throw
an
observation
about
the
weather
at
her
companion
patty
accepted
all
this
willingly
enough
but
philip
did
he
could
keep
his
eyes
off
patty
who
was
looking
her
very
prettiest
and
whose
own
eyes
when
she
raised
them
were
full
of
smiles
but
in
vain
he
endeavoured
to
make
her
talk
to
him
patty
remembered
van
reypen
injunctions
and
though
her
bewitching
personality
made
such
effort
useless
she
tried
to
be
absolutely
and
uninterestingly
silent
aunty
van
said
philip
at
last
giving
up
his
attempts
to
make
patty
converse
let
have
a
little
theatre
party
night
shall
us
i
get
a
box
and
if
you
and
miss
fairfield
will
go
i
be
delighted
i
go
with
pleasure
replied
his
aunt
but
miss
fairfield
will
be
obliged
to
decline
she
has
been
out
late
too
often
since
she
has
been
here
and
she
needs
rest
so
invite
the
delafields
instead
and
that
will
make
a
pleasant
quartette
for
an
instant
patty
was
furiously
angry
at
this
summary
disposal
of
herself
but
when
she
saw
philip
face
she
almost
screamed
with
laughter
crestfallen
faintly
expressed
his
appearance
he
was
crushed
and
looked
absolutely
stunned
how
he
is
under
his
aunt
thumb
thought
patty
secretly
disgusted
at
his
lack
of
but
she
suddenly
changed
her
mind
thank
you
aunty
van
she
heard
him
saying
in
a
cool
determined
voice
but
i
prefer
to
choose
my
own
guests
i
do
not
care
to
ask
the
delafields
unless
you
especially
desire
it
i
am
sorry
miss
fairfield
can
not
go
but
i
trust
you
will
honour
me
with
your
presence
philip
had
scored
van
reypen
well
knew
if
she
went
alone
with
her
nephew
under
such
conditions
he
would
be
sulky
all
the
evening
nor
could
she
insist
on
having
the
delafields
asked
after
the
way
he
had
put
it
she
then
nobly
endeavoured
to
undo
the
mischief
she
had
wrought
no
philip
i
do
care
especially
about
the
delafields
and
if
miss
fairfield
thinks
it
will
not
tire
her
too
much
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
her
accept
your
kindness
his
kindness
indeed
patty
felt
like
saying
do
you
know
i
am
patricia
fairfield
and
it
is
i
who
confer
an
honour
when
i
accept
an
invitation
it
was
exactly
pride
but
patty
had
been
brought
up
in
an
atmosphere
of
somewhat
chivalry
and
it
jarred
on
her
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
to
have
philip
invitation
to
her
referred
to
as
a
kindness
so
she
decided
to
take
a
stand
herself
i
thank
you
for
your
van
reypen
she
said
with
just
the
slightest
emphasis
on
but
i
can
not
accept
it
i
quite
agree
with
van
reypen
that
i
need
rest
the
speech
was
absurd
on
the
face
of
it
for
patty
rosy
dimpled
cheeks
and
sparkling
eyes
betokened
no
weariness
or
lassitude
but
van
reypen
accepted
this
evidence
of
the
girl
obedience
to
her
wishes
and
said
you
are
right
miss
fairfield
and
my
nephew
will
excuse
you
from
his
party
philip
sent
her
a
reproachful
glance
and
patty
dropped
her
eyes
again
wishing
dinner
was
over
at
last
the
ladies
left
the
table
and
philip
rose
and
held
aside
the
porti√®re
while
his
aunt
passed
through
as
patty
followed
he
detained
her
a
moment
and
whispered
it
is
cruel
of
you
to
punish
me
for
my
aunt
unkindness
i
ca
help
it
said
patty
and
as
her
troubled
eyes
met
his
angry
ones
they
both
smiled
and
peace
was
restored
after
friday
whispered
patty
as
she
went
through
the
doorway
after
friday
he
repeated
puzzled
by
her
words
but
reassured
by
her
smiles
and
then
van
reypen
sent
patty
to
her
room
for
the
night
and
when
philip
came
to
the
he
found
he
was
destined
to
be
entertained
by
his
aunt
alone
of
course
said
patty
to
her
own
reflection
in
her
mirror
a
companion
ca
expect
to
sit
with
quality
but
it
does
seem
a
shame
to
dress
up
pretty
like
this
and
then
be
sent
to
bed
at
nine
never
mind
only
three
evenings
more
in
this
house
and
then
victory
for
patty
fairfield
chapter
xvii
the
road
to
success
patty
adhered
to
her
resolution
not
to
go
to
the
theatre
on
monday
night
but
when
she
saw
van
reypen
and
philip
start
off
she
secretly
regretted
her
decision
she
loved
fun
and
gaiety
and
it
suddenly
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
been
foolishly
sensitive
about
van
reypen
attitude
toward
her
however
it
could
be
helped
now
so
she
prepared
to
spend
the
evening
reading
in
the
library
she
would
have
liked
to
hold
a
long
telephone
conversation
with
nan
and
her
father
but
she
thought
she
had
better
not
for
there
were
so
many
house
servants
on
duty
that
a
maid
or
a
footman
would
be
likely
to
overhear
her
she
played
the
piano
and
sang
a
little
then
she
wandered
about
the
large
and
lonely
rooms
patty
was
a
sociable
creature
and
had
never
before
spent
an
evening
entirely
alone
unless
when
engaged
in
some
important
and
engrossing
work
but
after
a
while
the
telephone
rang
and
when
the
told
her
the
call
was
for
her
she
flew
to
the
instrument
with
glad
anticipation
hello
she
cried
and
hello
returned
a
familiar
voice
oh
ken
of
all
people
how
you
know
i
was
here
oh
i
found
it
out
how
are
you
may
i
come
to
see
you
no
indeed
i
a
companion
i
not
expected
to
have
callers
but
glad
to
talk
to
you
this
way
i
alone
in
the
house
except
for
the
servants
alone
then
let
me
come
up
for
a
few
minutes
and
chat
no
van
reypen
would
like
it
i
sure
but
oh
ken
i
making
good
this
time
on
thursday
the
week
will
be
up
and
i
get
my
fifteen
dollars

that
gay
you
a
plucky
girl
patty
and
i
congratulate
you
is
it
very
horrid
no
it
is
exactly
horrid
but
i
fearfully
homesick
but
it
only
three
more
days
now
and
wo
i
be
glad
to
get
home
and
we
be
glad
to
have
you
the
goldfish
are
dull
and
moping
and
we
all
want
our
patty
back
again
that
nice
of
you
but
ken
how
did
you
know
where
to
find
me
i
made
nan
and
father
promise
not
to
tell
well
i
may
as
well
confess
i
basely
worried
it
out
of
miller
i
asked
him
where
he
took
you
to
last
thursday
afternoon
oh
i
meant
to
tell
him
not
to
tell
but
i
forgot
it
well
it
matter
much
as
you
chanced
to
strike
a
time
when
i
alone
but
call
me
up
again
i
not
supposed
to
have
any
social
acquaintances
good
for
you
patty
if
you
play
the
game
play
it
well
i
expect
a
prim
demure
companion
as
ever
was
of
course
i
am
and
if
the
lady
did
have
such
a
fishy
nephew
i
get
along
beautifully
oho
a
nephew
eh
and
he
smitten
with
your
charms
as
they
always
are
in
novels
yes
said
patty
in
a
simpering
tone
oh
yes
i
ca
see
you
but
i
know
you
have
your
finger
in
your
mouth
and
your
eyes
shyly
cast
down
you
clever
murmured
patty
giggling
but
now
you
may
go
ken
for
i
do
want
to
talk
to
you
any
more
come
round
thursday
night
ca
you
and
welcome
me
home
pooh
you
late
with
your
invitation
fairfield
has
already
invited
me
to
dinner
that
very
evening
good
well
for
now
i
have
reasons
for
wishing
to
discontinue
this
conversation
and
i
have
reasons
for
wishing
to
keep
on
if
you
tired
talking
sing
to
me
art
so
near
and
yet
so
far
hummed
patty
in
her
clear
sweet
voice
no
do
sing
central
will
think
you
a
concert
well
till
thursday
said
patty
and
hung
up
the
receiver
but
she
felt
much
more
cheerful
at
having
talked
with
kenneth
and
the
coming
days
seemed
easier
to
bear
they
proved
however
to
be
quite
hard
enough
the
very
next
day
when
patty
went
down
to
the
breakfast
room
determined
to
do
her
best
to
please
van
reypen
she
found
that
lady
suffering
from
an
attack
of
neuralgia
though
not
a
serious
one
it
seriously
affected
her
temper
and
she
was
cross
and
irritable
to
a
degree
that
patty
had
never
seen
equalled
she
snapped
at
the
servants
she
was
short
of
speech
to
patty
she
found
fault
with
everything
from
the
coffee
to
the
cat
after
breakfast
they
went
to
the
sunny
pleasant
morning
room
and
patty
made
up
her
mind
to
a
hard
day
then
she
had
an
inspiration
she
remembered
how
susceptible
van
reypen
was
to
flattery
and
she
determined
to
see
if
large
doses
of
it
would
cure
her
ill
temper
how
lovely
your
hair
is
said
patty
apropos
of
nothing
i
do
so
admire
white
hair
and
yours
is
so
abundant
and
of
such
fine
texture
as
she
had
hoped
van
reypen
smiled
in
a
pleased
way
ah
miss
fairfield
you
should
have
seen
it
when
i
was
a
girl
it
was
phenomenal
but
of
late
years
it
has
come
out
sadly
you
still
have
quantities
said
patty
and
very
truthfully
too
and
its
silvery
whiteness
is
so
becoming
to
your
complexion
do
you
think
so
said
van
reypen
smiling
most
amiably
i
think
it
much
wiser
not
to
colour
one
hair
for
so
many
people
turn
gray
quite
young
yes
they
do
i
several
friends
with
gray
hair
who
are
very
young
women
indeed
yes
agreed
the
other
comfortably
white
hair
no
longer
indicates
that
a
woman
is
advanced
in
years
you
speak
very
sensibly
miss
fairfield
patty
smiled
to
herself
at
the
success
of
her
little
ruse
and
after
all
she
thought
i
telling
her
only
the
truth
her
hair
is
lovely
and
she
may
as
well
know
i
appreciate
it
have
you
ever
tried
she
went
on
wearing
it
in
a
coronet
braid
no
i
thought
i
should
like
to
but
i
worn
puffs
so
long
i
know
how
to
change
let
me
do
it
for
you
said
patty
i
sure
i
could
dress
it
to
please
you
at
any
rate
it
would
do
no
harm
to
try
so
up
they
went
to
van
reypen
dressing
room
and
patty
spent
most
of
the
morning
trying
and
discussing
different
modes
of
van
reypen
maid
was
present
and
she
admired
patty
cleverness
and
deftness
at
the
work
you
have
a
touch
declared
van
reypen
as
she
surveyed
herself
by
the
aid
of
a
you
positively
frenchy
in
your
touch
where
did
you
learn
it
have
you
ever
been
a
no
said
patty
suppressing
her
smiles
i
never
have
but
i
spent
a
winter
in
paris
and
i
picked
up
some
french
notions
i
suppose
you
certainly
did
you
are
clever
with
your
fingers
i
can
see
that
can
you
trim
hats
yes
i
can
said
patty
smiling
to
herself
at
the
recollection
of
her
experiences
with
mme
villard
humph
you
seem
pretty
sure
of
yourself
i
wish
you
trim
one
for
me
then
but
i
do
want
you
to
spoil
the
materials
i
do
my
best
said
patty
meekly
and
van
reypen
instructed
her
maid
to
bring
out
some
boxes
this
she
said
taking
up
a
finished
hat
is
one
my
milliner
has
just
sent
home
and
i
think
it
a
fright
now
here
a
last
year
hat
but
the
plumes
are
lovely
if
you
could
untrim
this
first
one
and
transfer
these
plumes
and
then
add
these
roses
what
do
you
think
secretly
patty
thought
the
new
hat
was
lovely
just
as
it
was
but
her
plan
that
morning
was
to
humour
the
testy
old
lady
and
if
possible
make
her
forget
her
neuralgic
pains
so
she
took
the
hats
and
sat
down
to
rip
and
retrim
them
meantime
van
reypen
instructed
her
maid
to
practise
dressing
her
hair
in
the
fashion
patty
had
done
it
but
the
maid
was
not
very
deft
in
the
art
and
soon
patty
heard
van
reypen
shrilly
exclaiming
stupid
not
that
way
you
have
neither
taste
nor
brains
place
the
braid
higher
no
not
so
high
as
that
oh
you
an
idiot
deeming
it
best
not
to
interfere
patty
went
on
with
her
work
also
van
reypen
went
on
with
her
scolding
which
so
upset
the
maid
that
she
fell
to
weeping
and
thereby
roused
her
mistress
to
still
greater
ire
crying
are
you
she
exclaimed
if
you
had
such
a
painful
neck
and
shoulder
as
i
have
you
well
might
cry
but
to
cry
about
nothing
bah
leave
me
and
do
not
return
until
you
can
be
pleasant
miss
fairfield
will
you
please
finish
putting
up
my
hair
patty
laid
down
her
work
and
did
as
she
was
requested
she
was
sorry
for
the
maid
and
incensed
at
van
reypen
injustice
and
disagreeableness
but
she
felt
intuitively
that
it
was
the
best
plan
to
be
herself
kind
and
affable
oh
yes
i
do
it
she
said
pleasantly
your
hat
is
almost
finished
and
we
can
try
it
on
with
your
hair
done
this
way
i
sure
the
effect
will
be
charming
mollified
at
this
van
reypen
smiled
benignly
on
her
companion
and
also
smiled
admiringly
at
her
own
mirrored
reflection
now
said
patty
as
a
little
later
she
brought
the
completed
hat
for
inspection
i
will
try
this
on
and
see
how
it
looks
van
reypen
seated
herself
again
in
front
of
her
dressing
mirror
and
with
gestures
worthy
of
madame
villard
herself
patty
placed
the
hat
on
her
head
it
most
becoming
began
patty
when
van
reypen
interrupted
her
becoming
she
cried
it
is
dreadful
it
is
it
makes
me
look
like
an
old
woman
with
an
angry
jerk
she
snatched
the
offending
hat
from
her
head
and
threw
it
across
the
room
patty
was
about
to
give
a
horrified
exclamation
when
the
funny
side
of
it
struck
her
and
she
burst
into
laughter
van
reypen
was
really
an
elderly
lady
and
her
angry
surprise
at
being
made
to
look
like
one
seemed
very
funny
to
patty
but
in
a
moment
she
understood
the
case
she
had
thought
the
hat
in
question
of
too
youthful
a
type
for
van
reypen
and
in
retrimming
it
had
made
it
more
subdued
and
of
a
quieter
more
elderly
fashion
but
she
now
realised
that
she
had
been
expected
to
make
it
of
even
gayer
effect
than
it
had
shown
at
first
this
was
an
easy
matter
and
picking
up
the
hat
she
straightened
it
out
and
hastily
catching
up
a
bunch
of
pink
roses
and
a
glittering
buckle
she
said
oh
it
is
finished
yet
these
other
trimmings
i
want
to
put
in
place
while
the
hat
is
on
your
head
oh
said
van
reypen
only
but
she
sat
down
again
and
patty
replaced
the
hat
and
then
adjusted
the
roses
and
the
buckle
giving
the
whole
a
dainty
pretty
effect
which
though
perhaps
was
really
very
becoming
to
the
old
lady
charming
she
exclaimed
letting
her
recent
display
of
bad
temper
go
without
apology
i
felt
sure
you
could
do
it
this
afternoon
we
will
go
out
to
the
shops
and
buy
some
materials
and
you
shall
make
me
another
hat
they
did
so
and
though
it
meant
an
afternoon
of
rather
strenuous
shopping
patty
did
mind
it
much
for
van
reypen
could
fly
into
a
rage
in
the
presence
of
the
salespeople
and
so
the
days
dragged
by
patty
had
hard
work
to
keep
her
own
temper
when
her
employer
was
unreasonably
cross
and
snappish
but
she
stuck
to
her
plan
of
flattering
her
and
it
worked
well
more
often
than
not
nor
was
she
insincere
there
were
so
many
admirable
qualities
and
traits
of
van
reypen
that
she
really
admired
it
was
easy
enough
to
tell
her
so
and
invariably
the
lady
was
pleased
but
she
often
broke
out
into
foolish
unjustifiable
rages
and
then
patty
had
to
wait
meekly
until
they
passed
over
but
when
at
last
wednesday
evening
had
gone
by
and
she
went
to
her
room
knowing
it
was
the
last
night
she
should
spend
under
that
roof
she
was
glad
indeed
another
week
of
this
would
give
me
nervous
prostration
she
said
to
herself
but
my
week
is
up
and
that
means
success
i
have
really
and
truly
succeeded
in
earning
my
own
living
for
a
week
and
glad
and
proud
of
it
i
knew
i
should
succeed
but
i
confess
i
think
i
score
so
many
failures
first
but
perhaps
that
makes
my
success
all
the
sweeter
anyway
i
jolly
glad
i
going
home
wow
but
i
homesick
then
she
tumbled
into
bed
and
soon
forgot
her
homesickness
in
a
sound
dreamless
sleep
patty
had
been
uncertain
whether
to
tell
van
reypen
the
true
story
of
her
week
of
companionship
or
not
but
on
thursday
morning
she
decided
she
would
do
so
and
as
it
chanced
after
breakfast
van
reypen
herself
opened
the
way
for
patty
confidences
miss
fairfield
she
said
as
they
sat
down
in
the
library
you
know
our
trial
week
is
up
yes
van
reypen
and
you
remember
that
either
of
us
has
the
privilege
of
terminating
our
engagement
i
do
remember
and
though
i
fear
you
will
be
greatly
disappointed
i
must
tell
you
that
i
have
decided
that
i
can
not
keep
you
as
my
companion
as
patty
afterward
told
nan
she
was
struck
all
of
a
heap
she
had
been
wondering
how
she
should
persuade
van
reypen
to
let
her
go
and
now
the
lady
was
voluntarily
dismissing
her
it
was
so
sudden
and
so
unexpected
that
patty
showed
her
surprise
by
her
look
of
blank
amazement
i
knew
you
feel
dreadful
about
it
went
on
van
reypen
with
real
regret
in
her
tone
but
i
can
not
help
it
you
are
not
by
nature
fitted
for
the
position
you
are
i
do
exactly
know
how
to
express
it
but
you
are
not
of
a
subservient
disposition
no
said
patty
i
not
but
i
have
tried
to
do
as
you
wanted
me
to
yes
i
could
see
that
but
you
are
too
to
be
successful
in
a
position
of
this
kind
you
should
be
more
deferential
in
spirit
as
well
as
in
manner
do
i
make
myself
clear
you
do
van
reypen
said
patty
smiling
so
clear
that
i
am
going
to
tell
you
the
truth
about
this
whole
business
i
not
really
obliged
to
earn
my
own
living
i
have
a
happy
home
and
loving
parents
my
father
though
not
a
millionaire
is
wealthy
and
generous
enough
to
supply
all
my
wants
and
the
reason
i
took
this
position
with
you
is
a
special
and
peculiar
one
which
i
will
tell
you
about
if
you
care
to
hear
you
sly
puss
cried
van
reypen
with
a
smile
that
indicated
relief
rather
than
dismay
at
patty
revelation
then
you
been
only
masquerading
as
a
companion
yes
said
patty
smiling
back
at
her
that
about
the
size
of
it
chapter
xviii
home
again
after
patty
had
told
van
reypen
the
whole
story
of
her
efforts
to
earn
her
living
for
a
week
and
why
she
had
undertaken
such
a
thing
she
found
herself
occupying
a
changed
place
in
that
lady
regard
it
was
fine
of
you
perfectly
fine
van
reypen
declared
to
sacrifice
yourself
your
tastes
and
your
time
for
a
noble
end
like
that
do
praise
me
more
than
i
deserve
said
patty
smiling
i
did
begin
the
game
with
a
charitable
motive
but
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
easy
when
i
found
it
difficult
i
fear
i
kept
on
rather
from
stubbornness
than
anything
else
i
do
call
it
stubbornness
miss
fairfield
i
call
it
commendable
perseverance
and
i
glad
you
told
me
your
story
of
course
i
would
have
wished
you
to
tell
me
at
first
for
had
i
known
it
i
would
have
taken
you
but
you
have
honestly
tried
to
do
your
work
well
and
you
succeeded
as
well
as
you
could
but
as
i
told
you
you
are
not
made
for
that
sort
of
thing
your
disposition
is
not
that
of
a
subordinate
and
i
am
glad
you
do
not
really
have
to
be
one
you
have
earned
your
salary
this
week
however
and
i
gladly
pay
you
the
fifteen
dollars
we
agreed
upon
van
reypen
handed
patty
the
money
and
as
the
girl
took
it
she
said
earnestly
as
you
may
well
believe
van
reypen
this
money
means
more
to
me
than
any
i
have
ever
before
received
in
my
life
it
is
the
first
i
have
ever
earned
by
my
own
exertions
and
unless
i
meet
with
reverses
of
fortune
it
will
probably
be
the
last
but
more
than
that
it
proves
my
success
in
the
somewhat
doubtful
enterprise
i
undertook
and
it
assures
a
chance
at
least
of
another
girl
success
in
life
i
am
greatly
interested
in
your
young
art
student
went
on
van
reypen
can
you
not
bring
her
to
see
me
when
she
comes
and
perhaps
i
may
be
of
use
to
her
in
some
friendly
way
how
good
you
are
exclaimed
patty
she
was
surprised
at
the
complete
change
of
demeanour
in
van
reypen
though
of
course
she
realised
it
was
due
to
the
fact
that
she
was
now
looked
upon
as
a
social
equal
and
not
a
dependent
it
is
all
so
uncertain
yet
patty
went
on
i
do
know
exactly
how
we
are
to
persuade
the
girl
to
come
north
at
all
she
is
of
a
proud
and
sensitive
nature
that
would
reject
anything
like
charity
well
you
will
doubtless
arrange
the
matter
somehow
and
when
you
do
remember
that
i
shall
be
glad
to
help
in
any
way
i
can
thank
you
very
much
said
patty
it
may
be
that
you
can
indeed
help
us
and
now
van
reypen
may
i
read
to
you
or
something
you
know
my
week
is
up
until
this
afternoon
not
literally
perhaps
but
for
the
few
hours
that
are
left
of
your
stay
with
me
i
shall
look
upon
you
as
a
guest
not
a
and
as
i
always
like
to
entertain
my
guests
pleasantly
i
shall
if
you
agree
telephone
for
philip
to
come
to
luncheon
with
us
the
old
lady
eyes
twinkled
at
the
idea
of
philip
surprise
at
the
changed
conditions
and
patty
smiled
too
as
she
expressed
her
assent
when
philip
arrived
he
was
of
course
amazed
at
his
aunt
demeanour
she
not
only
seemed
to
approve
of
miss
fairfield
but
treated
her
as
an
honoured
guest
and
seemed
more
than
willing
that
philip
should
chat
socially
with
her
soon
she
explained
to
him
the
cause
of
her
sudden
change
of
attitude
philip
laughed
heartily
i
suspected
something
of
the
sort
he
said
miss
fairfield
did
strike
me
as
being
of
the
and
willin
to
please
variety
she
tried
her
best
but
her
deference
was
forced
and
her
meekness
assumed
but
she
did
it
well
said
van
reypen
oh
yes
very
well
still
i
like
her
better
in
her
natural
r√¥le
of
society
lady
oh
not
that
protested
patty
i
not
really
a
society
lady
in
fact
i
not
yet
i
just
a
new
york
girl
were
you
born
here
asked
van
reypen
no
said
patty
laughing
i
was
born
south
and
i
only
lived
north
about
five
years
one
of
those
i
spent
abroad
and
one
or
two
outside
of
new
york
so
when
i
say
i
a
new
york
girl
i
only
mean
that
i
live
here
now
may
i
come
to
see
you
asked
philip
where
do
you
live
i
live
on
street
said
patty
and
you
may
come
to
tea
some
wednesday
if
you
like
that
my
mother
and
i
often
receive
with
her
i
see
you
well
brought
up
said
van
reypen
nodding
her
head
approvingly
i
a
bit
surprised
though
that
your
mother
allowed
you
to
undertake
this
escapade
well
you
see
she
my
stepmother
she
only
six
years
older
than
i
am
so
she
has
much
jurisdiction
over
me
and
as
for
my
father
well
really
i
ran
away
the
luncheon
was
a
merry
feast
for
van
reypen
made
a
gala
affair
of
it
and
though
there
were
but
the
three
at
table
there
was
extra
elaboration
of
viands
and
decorations
philip
van
reypen
was
in
his
gayest
humour
and
his
aunt
was
beaming
and
affable
so
they
were
really
sorry
when
it
was
time
for
patty
to
say
at
four
miller
came
for
her
and
when
patty
saw
the
familiar
her
homesickness
came
back
like
a
big
wave
and
with
farewells
speedy
though
cordial
she
gladly
let
philip
hand
her
into
the
limousine
home
miller
she
said
with
a
glad
ring
in
her
voice
and
then
with
a
final
bow
and
smile
to
the
van
reypens
she
started
off
discharged
she
thought
smiling
to
herself
did
give
satisfaction
too
to
be
a
companion
huh
patty
fairfield
i
do
think
you
much
of
a
success
she
was
talking
to
the
reflection
of
herself
in
the
small
mirror
opposite
her
face
but
the
happy
and
smiling
countenance
she
saw
there
tally
with
her
remarks
oh
well
she
thought
i
only
agreed
to
earn
my
living
for
a
week
and
i
done
it
i
done
it
she
opened
her
purse
to
make
sure
the
precious
fifteen
dollars
was
still
there
and
she
looked
at
it
proudly
she
had
more
money
than
that
in
another
part
of
her
purse
but
no
bills
could
ever
look
so
valuable
as
the
ten
and
five
van
reypen
had
paid
her
at
last
she
reached
home
and
as
she
ran
up
the
steps
the
door
flew
open
and
she
saw
nan
and
her
father
with
smiling
faces
awaiting
her
oh
people
she
cried
oh
you
people
she
flung
herself
indiscriminately
into
their
open
arms
embracing
both
at
once
then
she
produced
her
precious
bills
and
waving
them
aloft
cried
i
succeeded
i
really
succeeded
behold
the
proofs
of
success
good
for
you
girlie
cried
her
father
you
have
succeeded
indeed
but
do
you
ever
dare
cut
up
such
a
prank
again
no
do
implored
nan
i
had
the
most
awful
time
the
whole
week
every
night
fred
vowed
he
was
going
to
bring
you
home
and
i
had
to
beg
him
not
to
i
wanted
you
to
win
and
i
felt
sure
you
would
this
time
but
you
owe
it
to
me
for
if
i
had
worked
so
hard
to
prevent
it
your
father
would
have
gone
after
you
long
ago
good
for
you
nan
cried
patty
you
been
a
trump
you
helped
me
through
every
time
in
all
my
failures
and
in
my
one
success
oh
i
so
much
to
tell
you
of
my
experiences
they
were
awfully
funny
they
keep
till
later
said
nan
you
must
run
and
dress
now
ken
and
the
farringtons
are
coming
to
dinner
to
help
us
celebrate
your
success
so
patty
went
dancing
away
to
her
own
room
singing
gaily
in
her
delight
at
being
once
more
at
home
oh
you
booful
room
she
cried
aloud
as
she
reached
her
own
door
all
full
of
pretty
things
and
fresh
flowers
and
my
own
dear
books
and
pictures
and
and
everything
she
threw
herself
on
the
couch
and
kissed
the
very
sofa
cushions
in
her
joy
at
seeing
them
again
then
she
made
her
toilette
and
put
on
one
of
her
prettiest
and
most
becoming
frocks
oh
daddy
dear
she
cried
meeting
him
in
the
hall
on
her
way
down
it
has
done
me
lots
of
good
to
be
homeless
for
a
week
i
appreciate
my
own
dear
home
so
much
more
but
you
were
away
from
it
for
a
year
oh
that
different
travelling
or
visiting
is
one
thing
but
working
for
your
living
is
quite
another
oh
lose
all
your
fortune
will
you
father
i
do
want
to
have
to
go
out
into
the
cold
world
and
earn
my
own
support
then
it
is
as
easy
as
you
thought
it
was
oh
dear
no
it
is
easy
at
all
it
dreadful
every
way
i
tried
was
worse
than
every
other
but
i
succeeded
did
i
yes
you
did
you
fulfilled
your
part
of
the
contract
and
when
the
time
comes
i
ready
to
fulfil
mine
we
have
to
see
hepworth
about
that
replied
patty
then
kenneth
and
the
two
farringtons
came
and
the
wonderful
fifteen
dollars
had
to
be
shown
to
them
and
they
had
to
be
told
all
about
patty
harrowing
experiences
i
never
again
express
an
opinion
on
matters
i
do
know
anything
about
declared
patty
just
think
i
only
said
i
thought
it
would
be
to
earn
fifteen
dollars
a
week
and
look
what
i
been
through
in
consequence
but
i
won
at
last
plucky
patty
said
kenneth
appreciatively
i
knew
you
win
if
it
took
all
summer
but
it
was
a
complete
triumph
confessed
patty
for
she
have
kept
me
another
week
she
practically
discharged
me
fired
cried
roger
in
glee
fired
from
your
last
place
wanted
a
situation
oh
patty
you
do
beat
all
then
patty
told
them
of
her
own
surprise
when
van
reypen
told
her
she
would
not
do
as
a
permanent
companion
and
they
all
laughed
heartily
at
the
funny
description
she
gave
of
the
scene
never
mind
said
her
father
you
fulfilled
the
conditions
a
week
was
the
stipulated
time
and
nothing
was
said
about
your
outlook
for
a
second
week
the
next
night
hepworth
came
and
the
whole
story
was
told
over
again
to
him
he
did
take
it
so
lightly
as
the
young
people
had
done
but
looked
at
patty
sympathetically
and
said
poor
little
girl
you
did
have
a
hard
time
did
you
yes
i
did
replied
patty
though
nobody
else
seems
to
realise
that
the
kindness
in
hepworth
glance
seemed
to
bring
back
to
her
all
those
long
lonely
weary
hours
and
she
felt
grateful
that
one
at
least
understood
what
she
had
suffered
it
was
worth
spending
that
awful
week
to
achieve
your
purpose
he
went
on
but
i
well
know
how
hard
it
was
for
a
girl
like
you
and
i
fancy
it
was
none
too
easy
to
find
yourself
at
the
beck
and
call
of
another
woman
no
it
was
said
patty
surprised
at
his
insight
how
did
you
know
that
because
you
are
an
independent
young
person
and
accustomed
to
ordering
your
own
times
and
seasons
so
i
sure
to
be
obedient
to
orders
was
somewhat
galling
it
was
and
patty
emphatic
nod
of
her
head
proved
to
hepworth
that
he
had
struck
a
true
chord
and
now
said
fairfield
when
can
i
make
my
offer
good
how
can
we
induce
the
rising
young
artist
to
come
to
the
metropolis
to
seek
fame
and
fortune
it
will
be
difficult
said
hepworth
as
she
is
not
only
proud
and
sensitive
but
very
shy
i
think
if
fairfield
would
write
one
of
her
kind
and
tactful
letters
that
miss
farley
would
be
persuaded
by
it
why
ca
i
write
a
kind
and
tactful
letter
asked
patty
it
my
picnic
you
could
write
a
tactful
letter
to
save
your
life
said
hepworth
looking
at
her
with
a
grave
smile
patty
returned
his
look
and
she
wondered
to
herself
why
she
was
angry
with
him
for
making
such
a
speech
but
as
she
well
knew
when
hepworth
made
a
seemingly
rude
speech
it
was
really
rude
but
it
was
usually
true
she
knew
herself
she
could
write
such
a
letter
as
this
occasion
required
and
she
knew
that
nan
could
so
she
smiled
meekly
at
hepworth
and
said
no
i
could
but
nan
can
be
tactful
to
beat
the
band
oh
patty
said
her
father
did
you
talk
like
that
to
van
reypen
no
wonder
she
discharged
you
no
i
did
daddy
truly
i
did
i
never
used
a
word
of
slang
that
whole
week
except
one
day
when
i
talked
to
nan
over
the
telephone
soon
you
be
old
enough
to
begin
to
think
it
time
to
stop
using
it
at
all
observed
hepworth
and
again
patty
took
his
mild
reproof
in
good
part
well
i
write
said
nan
shall
i
ask
miss
farley
to
come
to
visit
us
wo
she
think
that
rather
queer
do
put
it
just
that
way
advised
hepworth
say
that
you
as
a
friend
of
mine
are
interested
in
her
career
and
say
that
if
she
will
come
to
new
york
for
a
week
and
stay
with
you
you
think
you
can
help
her
make
arrangements
for
a
course
in
the
art
school
your
own
tact
will
dress
up
the
idea
so
as
to
make
it
palatable
to
her
pride
wo
it
be
fun
exclaimed
patty
it
will
be
almost
like
adopting
a
sister
what
is
she
like
hepworth
like
me
she
is
about
as
unlike
you
as
it
is
possible
for
a
girl
to
be
she
is
very
slender
dark
and
timid
with
the
air
of
a
frightened
animal
i
scare
her
to
death
declared
patty
with
conviction
i
sure
i
shall
i
do
mean
on
purpose
but
i
so
so
you
know
yes
you
are
agreed
hepworth
as
he
joined
in
the
general
laughter
but
that
of
yours
is
a
quality
that
i
wish
miss
farley
possessed
it
is
really
a
sort
of
brave
impulse
and
quick
determination
that
makes
you
dash
into
danger
or
enterprise
of
any
kind
and
win
added
patty
saucily
yes
and
win
after
a
time
oh
well
she
replied
tossing
her
head
bruce
spider
made
seven
attempts
before
he
succeeded
so
i
think
my
record
pretty
fair
i
think
so
too
said
hepworth
heartily
and
i
congratulate
you
on
your
plucky
perseverance
and
your
indomitable
will
you
put
up
a
brave
fight
and
you
won
i
know
how
you
suffered
under
that
petty
tyranny
and
your
success
in
such
circumstances
was
a
triumph
thank
you
said
patty
greatly
pleased
at
this
sincere
praise
from
one
whom
she
so
greatly
respected
it
would
have
been
harder
still
if
i
had
had
a
good
sense
of
humour
lots
of
times
when
i
wanted
to
cry
i
laughed
instead
hurrah
for
you
patty
girl
cried
her
father
i
rather
you
have
a
good
sense
of
humour
than
a
talent
for
oh
you
back
number
exclaimed
patty
they
do
do
now
daddy
well
china
painting
or
whatever
the
present
fad
is
but
hepworth
seemed
not
to
place
so
high
a
value
on
a
sense
of
humour
for
he
said
gravely
i
congratulate
you
on
your
steadfastness
of
purpose
which
is
one
of
the
finest
traits
of
your
character
thank
you
said
patty
with
dancing
eyes
you
give
it
a
nice
name
but
it
is
a
family
trait
with
us
fairfields
and
has
usually
been
called
well
supplemented
her
father
i
sure
that
just
as
good
a
name
chapter
xix
christine
comes
with
her
usual
tact
and
cleverness
nan
managed
the
whole
matter
successfully
she
wrote
to
the
friends
of
hepworth
in
the
south
who
were
interested
in
miss
farley
and
they
persuaded
the
girl
to
go
north
for
a
week
and
see
if
she
could
see
her
way
clear
to
staying
there
as
it
turned
out
miss
farley
had
some
acquaintances
in
new
york
and
when
their
invitation
was
added
to
that
of
fairfield
she
decided
to
make
the
trip
patty
and
nan
made
ready
for
her
with
great
care
and
kindness
a
guest
room
was
specially
prepared
for
her
use
and
patty
adorned
it
with
some
of
her
own
pet
pictures
a
few
good
casts
and
certain
bits
of
that
she
thought
would
appeal
to
an
art
student
if
hepworth
had
said
the
girl
had
real
talent
i
be
hopeless
of
the
whole
thing
said
nan
for
i
do
think
the
most
futile
sort
of
young
woman
is
the
one
who
dabbles
in
art
with
a
big
a
oh
christine
farley
is
that
sort
declared
patty
i
do
believe
she
wears
her
hair
tumbling
down
and
a
byron
collar
with
a
big
black
ribbon
bow
at
her
throat
i
used
to
see
that
sort
copying
in
the
art
galleries
in
paris
and
they
hopeless
but
i
imagine
miss
farley
is
a
tidy
little
thing
and
her
genius
is
too
real
for
those
effects
well
then
i
put
this
photograph
of
the
hermes
in
here
in
place
of
this
art
calendar
she
like
it
better
of
course
she
will
and
i
going
to
put
a
pretty
kimono
and
slippers
in
the
wardrobe
probably
she
wo
have
pretty
ones
and
i
know
she
love
if
you
owned
a
white
elephant
patty
you
get
a
kimono
for
it
would
you
i
would
i
love
kimonos
pretty
ones
and
besides
it
would
fit
an
elephant
better
than
a
directoire
gown
would
patty
what
a
goose
you
are
there
now
the
room
looks
lovely
the
flowers
are
just
right
not
too
many
and
just
in
the
right
places
yes
agreed
patty
if
she
does
like
this
room
i
wash
my
hands
of
her
but
she
will
and
she
did
when
the
small
shy
southern
girl
arrived
that
afternoon
and
patty
herself
showed
her
up
to
her
room
she
seemed
to
respond
at
once
to
the
warm
cosiness
of
the
place
it
just
such
a
room
as
i
often
imagined
but
i
never
seen
she
said
smiling
round
upon
the
dainty
attractive
appointments
you
dear
cried
patty
throwing
her
arms
round
her
guest
and
kissing
her
when
she
had
first
met
christine
downstairs
she
was
embarrassed
herself
at
the
southern
girl
painful
shyness
when
miss
farley
had
tried
to
speak
words
of
greeting
a
lump
came
into
her
throat
and
she
could
speak
at
all
to
put
her
more
at
her
ease
patty
had
led
her
at
once
upstairs
and
now
the
presence
of
only
patty
and
the
view
of
the
welcoming
room
made
her
forget
her
embarrassment
and
seem
more
like
her
natural
self
i
can
not
thank
you
she
began
i
am
a
bit
bewildered
by
it
all
of
course
you
are
said
patty
cheerily
do
bother
about
thanks
and
do
feel
shy
let
pretend
we
known
each
other
for
years
long
enough
to
use
first
names
may
i
take
your
hat
off
christine
tears
sprang
to
christine
farley
eyes
at
this
welcome
and
she
said
you
make
me
ashamed
of
my
stupid
shyness
really
i
try
to
overcome
it
patty
and
soon
the
two
girls
were
chatting
cosily
and
veritably
as
if
they
had
been
acquainted
a
long
time
presently
nan
came
in
if
you
prefer
miss
farley
she
said
you
need
come
down
to
dinner
i
have
a
tray
sent
up
here
i
know
you
tired
with
your
journey
no
thank
you
fairfield
i
not
tired
and
i
think
i
go
down
the
girl
would
have
greatly
preferred
to
accept
the
offer
of
dining
in
her
own
room
but
she
felt
it
her
duty
to
conquer
the
absurd
timidity
which
made
her
dread
facing
strangers
at
dinner
i
be
glad
if
you
will
said
nan
simply
fairfield
will
like
to
welcome
you
and
hepworth
will
be
the
only
other
guest
you
are
not
afraid
of
him
oh
no
said
christine
her
face
lighting
up
at
thought
of
her
kind
friend
he
has
been
so
good
to
me
his
criticisms
of
my
work
helped
me
more
than
any
of
my
teachers
yes
he
is
an
able
artist
and
a
man
of
true
kindness
and
worth
agreed
nan
very
well
miss
farley
we
dine
at
seven
now
nan
began
patty
smiling
that
the
wrong
tone
we
going
to
make
this
girlie
feel
homelike
and
comfortable
and
omit
all
formality
we
going
to
call
her
by
her
first
name
and
we
going
to
treat
her
as
one
of
ourselves
now
you
just
revise
that
little
speech
of
dine
at
seven
miss
farley
all
right
said
nan
quickly
catching
patty
idea
i
glad
to
revise
it
how
this
dinner
at
seven
christine
but
you
hop
into
your
clothes
and
come
on
down
earlier
that
a
lot
better
said
patty
approvingly
patting
her
shoulder
while
christine
farley
who
was
all
unaccustomed
to
this
sort
of
raillery
looked
on
in
admiration
you
see
she
said
i
only
very
plain
clothes
i
not
at
all
familiar
with
the
ways
of
society
or
even
of
people
oh
pooh
said
patty
emphatically
if
not
very
elegantly
do
you
bother
about
that
in
this
house
trot
out
your
frocks
and
i
tell
you
what
to
put
on
after
some
consideration
she
selected
a
frock
of
that
peculiar
shade
known
as
ashes
of
roses
it
was
of
soft
merino
and
made
very
simply
with
long
straight
lines
do
you
like
that
said
christine
looking
pleased
that
my
newest
one
and
i
designed
it
myself
see
i
wear
this
with
it
she
took
from
her
box
a
dull
silver
girdle
and
chatelaine
of
antique
carved
silver
and
a
comb
for
her
hair
of
similar
style
lovely
cried
patty
oh
you
an
artist
all
right
dress
your
hair
low
in
a
soft
coil
but
of
course
you
know
how
to
do
that
i
send
louise
to
hook
you
up
and
i
come
back
for
you
when
i
dressed
for
now
waving
her
hand
gaily
laughing
patty
ran
away
to
her
own
room
and
christine
sank
down
in
a
big
chair
to
collect
her
senses
it
was
all
so
new
and
strange
to
her
brought
up
in
the
plainest
circumstances
the
warmth
and
light
and
fragrance
of
this
home
seemed
to
her
like
fairyland
and
nan
and
patty
in
their
gay
moods
and
their
happy
seemed
as
if
of
a
different
race
of
beings
from
herself
but
i
learn
it
she
thought
with
a
determination
which
she
had
rarely
felt
and
scarce
knew
she
possessed
her
nature
was
one
that
needed
a
spur
or
help
from
another
and
then
she
was
ready
to
do
her
part
too
but
she
could
not
take
the
initiative
and
now
realising
the
disinterested
kindness
of
these
good
people
her
sense
of
gratitude
made
her
resolve
to
meet
their
kindness
with
appreciation
yes
she
said
to
herself
as
she
deftly
dressed
her
hair
in
front
of
the
mirror
i
conquer
this
silly
timidity
if
it
kills
me
i
take
patty
fairfield
for
a
model
and
i
acquire
that
very
same
ease
and
grace
that
she
has
christine
was
imitative
by
nature
and
it
seemed
to
her
now
that
she
could
never
feel
stupidly
embarrassed
again
but
after
patty
came
to
take
her
downstairs
and
as
they
neared
the
door
the
foolish
shyness
all
returned
and
she
was
white
and
trembling
as
she
crossed
the
hall
brace
up
whispered
patty
understanding
you
looking
lovely
christine
now
be
gay
and
chattery
chattery
indeed
her
tongue
seemed
paralysed
her
very
neck
felt
strained
and
stiff
and
she
stumbled
over
the
rug
in
her
effort
to
stop
trembling
in
her
own
room
alone
with
patty
and
nan
she
had
overcome
this
but
now
in
the
brilliantly
lighted
and
the
presence
of
other
people
the
terrible
timidity
returned
and
christine
made
a
most
unsuccessful
entrance
but
fairfield
ignored
the
girl
embarrassment
and
said
cordially
but
quietly
how
do
you
do
miss
farley
i
am
very
glad
to
welcome
you
here
his
kind
handclasp
reassured
her
even
more
than
his
pleasant
words
and
then
hepworth
greeted
her
you
did
well
to
come
he
said
i
am
glad
to
see
you
in
new
york
at
last
but
christine
could
recover
herself
and
so
as
the
kindest
thing
to
do
the
rest
rather
let
her
alone
and
chatted
on
other
subjects
gradually
she
grew
less
agitated
and
as
their
merry
waxed
gay
and
frivolous
her
determination
returned
that
she
too
would
acquire
this
accomplishment
then
dinner
was
announced
and
though
outwardly
calm
the
southern
girl
was
inwardly
in
great
trepidation
lest
she
commit
some
ignorant
error
in
etiquette
but
she
was
of
gentle
birth
and
breeding
and
innately
refined
so
she
knew
intuitively
regarding
all
points
save
perhaps
some
modern
trifles
of
conventional
usage
nan
who
was
watching
her
though
unobserved
led
the
conversation
around
to
subjects
in
which
christine
might
be
likely
to
be
interested
and
was
rewarded
at
last
by
seeing
the
girl
face
light
up
with
an
enjoyment
unmarred
by
gradually
she
was
induced
to
take
some
part
in
their
talk
and
once
she
told
an
anecdote
of
her
own
experience
without
seeming
aware
of
her
unusual
surroundings
she
do
thought
patty
it
is
ignorance
or
inexperience
the
greatest
trouble
it
just
ingrowing
shyness
and
she
got
to
get
over
it
i
see
that
she
does
too
hepworth
read
patty
unspoken
thoughts
in
her
eyes
and
nodded
approval
patty
nodded
back
with
a
dimpling
smile
and
christine
seeing
it
vowed
afresh
to
gain
the
ability
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
herself
for
all
southern
girls
have
a
touch
of
the
coquette
in
their
natures
but
poor
christine
was
nearly
choked
out
by
the
weeds
of
timidity
and
after
dinner
it
was
easier
they
went
to
the
cosy
library
and
the
atmosphere
seemed
more
informal
hepworth
brought
up
the
subject
of
miss
farley
work
and
she
was
persuaded
to
fetch
some
sketches
to
show
them
though
not
able
to
appreciate
the
fine
points
of
promise
as
hepworth
did
they
were
all
greatly
pleased
with
them
and
fairfield
declared
them
wonderful
in
her
own
field
christine
was
fearless
and
quite
sure
of
herself
she
talked
intelligently
about
pictures
and
many
pleasant
plans
were
made
for
taking
her
to
see
several
collections
then
on
exhibition
as
well
as
to
the
metropolitan
and
other
art
galleries
nan
and
patty
exchanged
pleased
glances
as
christine
talked
eagerly
and
with
shining
eyes
and
pink
cheeks
about
her
own
aims
and
ambitions
hepworth
was
responsive
and
advised
her
on
some
minor
points
but
the
great
question
of
her
art
education
in
new
york
was
not
touched
upon
that
first
evening
christine
had
grown
almost
gay
in
her
chatter
when
kenneth
was
announced
like
a
sensitive
plant
at
a
human
touch
she
lost
all
her
poise
her
face
turned
white
and
her
lips
quivered
as
she
braced
herself
for
the
ordeal
of
meeting
a
stranger
oh
thought
patty
almost
disgusted
at
this
foolishness
she
is
the
limit
but
nan
appreciated
more
truly
the
real
state
of
the
case
and
knew
that
christine
had
borne
just
about
all
she
could
and
that
owing
to
physical
fatigue
and
mental
strain
her
nerves
were
just
about
ready
to
give
way
how
do
you
do
kenneth
said
nan
airily
too
bad
you
did
come
earlier
i
am
just
taking
our
little
guest
away
from
this
admiring
crowd
who
are
tiring
her
all
out
with
their
admiration
she
may
just
say
to
you
and
then
i
going
to
carry
her
off
miss
farley
this
is
our
kenneth
mr
harper
stimulated
by
nan
support
and
by
the
sudden
chance
for
release
christine
managed
to
acknowledge
the
introduction
prettily
enough
and
then
gladly
let
nan
take
her
upstairs
to
bed
i
sorry
i
so
horrid
said
the
girl
as
nan
helped
her
take
off
her
gown
nonsense
replied
nan
cheerily
you
were
horrid
a
bit
you
looked
lovely
and
behaved
like
a
little
lady
your
nerves
are
overwrought
and
i
do
wonder
just
tumble
into
bed
dearie
and
forget
everything
in
all
the
world
except
that
you
among
warm
friends
nan
had
most
comforting
ways
and
soon
christine
forgot
her
troubles
in
a
happy
sleep
meantime
kenneth
was
admiring
her
sketches
whew
he
said
she
a
genius
all
right
but
such
a
shy
little
mouse
never
can
succeed
as
an
artist
yes
she
will
declared
patty
her
shyness
will
wear
off
in
new
york
i
going
to
eradicate
it
from
her
somehow
and
then
we
going
to
make
a
famous
artist
of
her
you
can
be
a
great
help
to
her
patty
said
hepworth
if
any
one
makes
christine
think
she
can
do
things
she
can
do
them
yes
i
see
that
already
agreed
patty
and
i
going
to
be
the
one
to
make
her
think
she
can
do
them
huh
teased
kenneth
you
think
you
can
make
anybody
think
they
think
anything
sure
said
patty
complacently
well
do
teach
miss
farley
to
talk
slang
said
fairfield
laughing
for
it
would
be
too
incongruous
with
that
madonna
face
of
hers
she
is
like
a
madonna
is
she
said
patty
thoughtfully
i
been
trying
to
think
what
her
face
reminded
me
of
yes
she
is
said
hepworth
and
as
i
feel
pretty
sure
you
teach
her
to
use
slang
why
do
you
take
this
occasion
to
discontinue
the
use
of
it
yourself
ca
do
it
returned
patty
there
are
times
in
my
mad
career
when
nothing
expresses
what
i
want
to
say
so
well
as
a
mild
bit
of
slang
i
never
say
anything
very
dreadful
of
course
you
do
declared
kenneth
who
loved
to
take
patty
part
against
hepworth
why
you
would
be
patty
if
you
used
only
dictionary
english
all
the
slang
miss
farley
gets
from
you
will
do
her
good
rather
than
harm
she
needs
it
in
her
i
agree
with
the
spirit
of
that
if
not
the
letter
said
hepworth
kindly
and
patty
said
yes
she
needs
to
be
jollied
and
you
take
it
from
me
she
going
to
get
jollied
chapter
xx
a
satisfactory
conclusion
as
nan
had
surmised
christine
was
worn
out
by
her
day
of
fatigue
and
excitement
and
the
next
morning
found
her
possessed
of
better
mental
poise
and
a
more
placid
manner
and
as
more
days
went
by
the
girl
improved
greatly
in
demeanour
and
bearing
and
lost
to
a
great
degree
her
look
of
startled
fear
and
painful
of
course
this
was
not
accomplished
completely
or
all
at
once
but
helped
by
the
kind
gentleness
of
nan
and
affectionate
chaffing
of
patty
christine
grew
more
accustomed
to
the
pleasant
social
atmosphere
into
which
she
had
been
so
suddenly
thrown
they
visited
picture
galleries
and
went
to
the
shops
and
went
driving
and
motoring
and
though
christine
could
not
be
persuaded
to
go
to
afternoon
teas
or
to
formal
luncheons
yet
she
enjoyed
the
pleasures
she
had
and
grew
every
day
more
at
her
ease
in
society
her
own
determination
helped
her
greatly
she
purposed
to
yet
become
as
unaffected
and
as
patty
and
though
she
knew
she
could
never
acquire
patty
inborn
gaiety
of
spirit
she
resolved
to
come
as
near
to
it
as
she
could
with
her
naturally
quiet
disposition
the
two
girls
became
fast
friends
and
after
a
few
days
patty
ventured
to
broach
the
subject
of
christine
career
to
her
surprise
christine
was
quite
ready
to
talk
about
it
and
asked
patty
advice
as
to
ways
and
means
i
already
learned
she
said
that
i
have
some
talent
and
that
i
need
the
instruction
and
experience
that
i
can
get
here
and
can
not
get
at
home
when
i
once
make
up
my
mind
to
a
thing
i
spare
no
effort
to
achieve
it
and
now
i
determined
to
get
an
art
education
by
some
manner
or
means
hooray
for
you
cried
patty
for
christine
cheeks
glowed
and
her
eyes
sparkled
with
the
force
of
her
speech
that
the
way
to
talk
christine
you
do
me
proud
now
go
on
what
have
you
in
mind
tell
your
aunt
patty
all
about
it
christine
smiled
at
patty
funny
little
ways
but
she
went
on
bravely
i
want
to
stay
in
new
york
for
a
year
at
least
i
afraid
of
it
desperately
so
the
very
sound
of
the
traffic
scares
me
out
of
my
wits
but
i
going
to
conquer
that
and
i
going
to
conquer
my
shyness
and
timidity
and
all
the
foolish
things
that
stand
in
my
way
that
the
ticket
cried
patty
clapping
her
hands
good
old
christine
go
in
and
win
wait
a
bit
patty
that
all
very
well
so
far
as
determination
and
will
are
concerned
and
i
can
do
it
my
will
is
strong
and
i
know
i
started
now
on
the
right
track
but
there
are
many
hard
facts
to
face
there
a
sordid
side
to
the
question
that
ca
be
solved
by
and
determination
hepworth
thinks
i
can
get
a
scholarship
practically
without
cost
but
in
addition
to
that
i
have
to
pay
my
board
you
know
and
i
have
very
little
money
my
dear
old
father
can
send
me
a
small
allowance
but
we
are
a
large
family
and
he
is
not
rich
so
i
want
to
know
if
you
think
i
could
earn
enough
by
some
work
outside
my
classes
to
pay
my
board
say
about
fifteen
dollars
a
week
do
you
patty
could
help
it
this
question
from
christine
was
too
much
she
was
sitting
on
a
couch
and
she
put
her
head
down
into
a
big
soft
pillow
and
shook
with
laughter
did
think
a
girl
could
earn
fifteen
dollars
a
week
she
indeed
with
a
strange
sound
between
a
gurgle
and
a
choke
she
ran
out
of
the
room
not
for
worlds
would
she
have
christine
think
she
was
laughing
at
her
so
in
a
moment
she
had
straightened
her
grinning
face
smothered
her
giggles
and
returned
saying
excuse
me
please
i
had
a
sudden
choking
spell
what
were
you
saying
you
poor
dear
may
i
get
you
a
glass
of
water
no
thanks
i
all
right
now
as
to
your
question
no
christine
i
do
think
you
could
earn
fifteen
dollars
a
week
no
nor
fifteen
cents
a
week
while
you
occupied
with
your
lessons
christine
looked
aghast
oh
patty
she
said
then
what
am
i
to
do
i
thought
you
say
yes
i
could
earn
that
sum
easily
again
patty
wanted
to
laugh
a
month
ago
she
would
have
said
that
very
thing
christine
she
said
gently
listen
to
me
we
fairfields
and
hepworth
all
take
an
interest
in
you
and
in
your
career
we
all
feel
sure
you
will
yet
be
a
great
artist
of
course
our
belief
is
founded
on
hepworth
assertions
but
we
know
he
is
capable
of
judging
now
you
must
have
that
year
of
study
and
by
that
time
hepworth
feels
sure
you
can
earn
quite
a
lot
of
money
by
illustrating
and
whatever
he
thinks
goes
well
said
christine
as
patty
paused
uncertain
how
to
proceed
well
you
see
went
on
patty
suddenly
deciding
that
the
plain
outspoken
facts
were
best
father
has
offered
to
pay
your
board
for
a
year
at
some
nice
pleasant
and
mercy
the
matter
for
christine
had
turned
first
a
blazing
fiery
red
and
then
as
white
as
chalk
and
seemed
about
to
tumble
off
her
chair
brace
up
there
cried
patty
shaking
her
by
the
shoulder
do
you
faint
or
do
anything
silly
i
take
it
all
back
father
would
do
such
a
thing
you
misunderstand
said
christine
smiling
faintly
through
now
rapidly
falling
tears
i
almost
fainted
from
sheer
gladness
oh
i
thought
you
were
angry
and
offended
and
insulted
and
mad
as
hops
and
everything
like
that
oh
no
cried
the
other
why
patty
it
is
charity
it
great
big
splendid
kindness
and
it
just
a
loan
you
understand
i
can
pay
it
back
in
a
couple
of
years
after
i
once
begin
to
earn
money
patty
you
do
know
how
sure
i
am
of
my
own
ability
now
that
i
understand
my
limitations
i
ca
explain
it
but
i
see
success
ahead
as
surely
as
i
see
the
blue
sky
out
of
that
window
christine
gazed
out
of
the
window
with
rapt
eyes
as
if
she
saw
visions
of
the
fame
and
glory
that
were
yet
to
be
her
portion
you
duck
cried
patty
embracing
her
you
just
splendiferous
that
the
loveliest
way
you
could
have
taken
father
offer
he
is
great
big
splendid
kindness
personified
and
i
so
glad
you
see
it
that
evening
fairfield
ratified
patty
statements
and
definitely
offered
to
pay
christine
board
bills
for
a
year
to
patty
surprise
christine
showed
no
shyness
or
agitation
as
she
answered
him
only
nan
understood
that
the
girl
gratitude
was
too
real
and
too
deep
for
any
troublesome
to
disturb
it
fairfield
she
said
i
accept
your
offer
with
unspeakable
thankfulness
it
means
my
whole
career
and
i
assure
you
i
shall
reach
my
goal
of
course
it
is
a
financial
loan
but
after
a
year
i
shall
be
in
a
position
to
begin
to
pay
it
back
and
it
shall
be
promptly
paid
do
not
think
i
have
unfounded
faith
in
my
success
i
know
what
i
already
possess
and
what
more
i
need
and
though
my
progress
to
fame
may
be
slow
and
take
many
long
years
yet
after
a
year
tuition
i
shall
be
able
to
command
a
comfortable
income
in
return
for
my
work
christine
eyes
shone
with
earnestness
and
steadfast
purpose
and
her
face
seemed
to
be
fairly
transfigured
hers
was
no
idle
boasting
it
was
clear
to
be
seen
she
spoke
from
a
positive
knowledge
of
herself
and
indeed
she
only
corroborated
what
hepworth
had
said
of
her
put
it
that
way
if
you
like
said
fairfield
kindly
we
need
not
talk
now
about
repayment
just
go
ahead
and
find
a
cosy
pleasant
and
then
ho
for
brushes
and
and
hurrah
for
our
artist
so
genial
were
his
words
and
manner
that
christine
caught
his
spirit
of
vivacity
and
responded
hurrah
for
the
fairfields
so
it
was
all
settled
and
hepworth
was
more
than
delighted
when
he
learned
all
about
it
patty
gave
a
little
afternoon
tea
for
christine
the
last
day
of
her
stay
and
though
christine
would
have
greatly
preferred
not
to
be
present
she
yielded
to
patty
entreaties
and
did
her
best
to
overcome
her
shyness
and
be
a
satisfactory
guest
of
honour
she
a
beauty
is
she
said
roger
to
patty
as
they
stood
looking
at
christine
while
the
tea
was
in
progress
yes
said
patty
when
she
is
talking
to
her
own
sort
of
people
see
those
are
really
big
artists
and
she
is
a
bit
afraid
or
embarrassed
but
put
some
society
girls
near
her
and
she
crumples
all
up
she
get
over
it
said
roger
and
i
say
patty
you
did
a
big
thing
getting
her
here
for
of
course
it
all
due
to
you
and
your
plucky
perseverance
in
that
foolish
scheme
of
earning
your
living
huh
it
was
foolish
since
it
succeeded
said
patty
airily
well
the
success
is
foolish
but
your
first
attempts
were
i
do
care
it
was
good
experience
i
learned
a
lot
and
i
not
sorry
for
my
part
of
it
not
even
the
part
that
made
you
acquainted
with
me
said
a
merry
voice
and
patty
turned
to
see
philip
van
reypen
holding
out
a
hand
in
greeting
no
cried
patty
as
she
cordially
shook
hands
with
the
young
man
no
not
sorry
for
that
part
for
that
was
the
success
i
do
want
to
be
returned
philip
gaily
but
that
sounds
as
if
meeting
me
were
the
success
that
was
what
i
meant
said
patty
smiling
and
dimpling
but
it
remains
to
be
seen
perhaps
we
can
make
that
a
success
also
do
let
us
try
said
philip
