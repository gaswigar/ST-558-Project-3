the
blessed
damozel
leaned
out
from
the
gold
bar
of
heaven
her
eyes
were
deeper
much
than
a
deep
water
even
she
had
three
lilies
in
her
hand
and
the
stars
in
her
hair
were
seven
ii
her
robe
ungirt
from
clasp
to
hem
no
wrought
flowers
did
adorn
but
a
white
rose
of
mary
s
gift
on
the
neck
meetly
worn
and
her
hair
lying
down
her
back
was
yellow
like
ripe
corn
iii
herseemed
she
scarce
had
been
a
day
one
of
god
s
choristers
the
wonder
was
not
yet
quite
gone
from
that
still
look
of
hers
albeit
to
them
she
left
her
day
had
counted
as
ten
years
iv
to
it
is
ten
years
of
years
yet
now
here
in
this
place
surely
she
leaned
o
er
me
hair
fell
all
about
my
face
nothing
the
of
leaves
the
whole
year
sets
apace
illustration
surely
she
leaned
o
er
me
it
was
the
terrace
of
god
s
house
that
she
was
standing
on
by
god
built
over
the
sheer
depth
in
which
space
is
begun
so
high
that
looking
downward
thence
she
could
scarce
see
the
sun
vi
it
lies
from
heaven
across
the
flood
of
ether
as
a
bridge
beneath
the
tides
of
day
and
night
with
flame
and
blackness
ridge
the
void
as
low
as
where
this
earth
spins
like
a
fretful
midge
vii
but
in
those
tracts
with
her
it
was
the
peace
of
utter
light
and
silence
for
no
breeze
may
stir
along
the
steady
flight
of
seraphim
no
echo
there
beyond
all
depth
or
height
viii
heard
hardly
some
of
her
new
friends
playing
at
holy
games
spake
among
themselves
their
virginal
chaste
names
and
the
souls
mounting
up
to
god
went
by
her
like
thin
flames
ix
and
still
she
bowed
herself
and
stooped
into
the
vast
waste
calm
till
her
bosom
s
pressure
must
have
made
the
bar
she
leaned
on
warm
and
the
lilies
lay
as
if
asleep
along
her
bended
arm
x
from
the
fixt
lull
of
heaven
she
saw
time
like
a
pulse
shake
fierce
through
all
the
worlds
her
gaze
still
strove
in
that
steep
gulph
to
pierce
the
swarm
and
then
she
spake
as
when
the
stars
sang
in
their
spheres
xi
i
wish
that
he
were
come
to
me
for
he
will
come
she
said
have
i
not
prayed
in
solemn
heaven
on
earth
has
he
not
prayed
are
not
two
prayers
a
perfect
strength
and
shall
i
feel
afraid
xii
when
round
his
head
the
aureole
clings
and
he
is
clothed
in
white
i
ll
take
his
hand
and
go
with
him
to
the
deep
wells
of
light
and
we
will
step
down
as
to
a
stream
and
bathe
there
in
god
s
sight
illustration
we
two
will
stand
beside
that
xiii
we
two
will
stand
beside
that
shrine
occult
withheld
untrod
whose
lamps
tremble
continually
with
prayer
sent
up
to
god
and
where
each
need
revealed
expects
its
patient
period
xiv
we
two
will
lie
i
the
shadow
of
that
living
mystic
tree
within
whose
secret
growth
the
dove
sometimes
is
felt
to
be
while
every
leaf
that
his
plumes
touch
saith
his
name
audibly
xv
and
i
myself
will
teach
to
i
myself
lying
the
songs
i
sing
here
which
his
mouth
shall
pause
in
hushed
and
slow
finding
some
knowledge
at
each
pause
and
some
new
thing
to
know
xvi
alas
to
wise
simple
mind
these
things
were
all
but
known
before
they
trembled
on
her
sense
her
voice
had
caught
their
tone
alas
for
lonely
heaven
alas
for
life
wrung
out
alone
illustration
and
i
myself
will
teach
to
xvii
alas
and
though
the
end
were
reached
was
part
understood
or
borne
in
trust
and
for
her
sake
shall
this
too
be
found
good
may
the
close
lips
that
knew
not
prayer
praise
ever
though
they
would

are

xx
he
shall
fear
haply
and
be
dumb
then
will
i
lay
my
cheek
to
his
and
tell
about
our
love
not
once
abashed
or
weak
and
the
dear
mother
will
approve
my
pride
and
let
me
speak

herself
shall
bring
us
hand
in
hand
to
him
round
whom
all
souls
unnumber
d
solemn
heads
bowed
with
their
aureoles
and
angels
meeting
us
shall
sing
to
their
citherns
and
citoles
xxii
there
will
i
ask
of
christ
the
lord
thus
much
for
him
and
me
to
have
more
blessing
than
on
earth
in
nowise
but
to
be
as
then
we
were
as
then
at
peace
yea
verily
xxiii
yea
verily
when
he
is
come
we
will
do
thus
and
thus
till
this
my
vigil
seem
quite
strange
and
almost
fabulous
we
two
will
live
at
once
one
life
and
peace
will
be
with
us
xxiv
she
gazed
and
listened
and
then
said
less
sad
of
speech
than
mild
all
this
is
when
he
comes
she
ceased
the
light
thrilled
past
her
filled
with
angels
in
strong
level
lapse
her
eyes
prayed
and
she
smiled
illustration
and
laid
her
face
between
her
hands
xxv
i
saw
her
smile
but
soon
their
flight
was
vague
mid
the
poised
spheres
and
then
she
cast
her
arms
along
the
golden
barriers
and
laid
her
face
between
her
hands
and
wept
i
heard
her
tears
