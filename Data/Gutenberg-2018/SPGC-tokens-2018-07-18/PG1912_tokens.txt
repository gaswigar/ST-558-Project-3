my
dear
ferdinand
if
the
chances
of
the
world
of
literature
sua
fata
should
allow
these
lines
to
be
an
enduring
record
that
will
still
be
but
a
trifle
in
return
for
the
trouble
you
have
taken
you
the
hozier
the

of
these
studies
of

you
to

the

the
hundred
great
names
that
form
the
aristocracy
of
the
human

owe
their
lordly
mottoes
and
ingenious
armorial
bearings
indeed
the
armorial
of
the
etudes
devised
by
ferdinand
de
gramont
gentleman
is
a
complete
manual
of
french
heraldry
in
which
nothing
is
forgotten
not
even
the
arms
of
the
empire
and
i
shall
preserve
it
as
a
monument
of
friendship
and
of
benedictine
patience
what
profound
knowledge
of
the
old
feudal
spirit
is
to
be
seen
in
the
motto
of
the
beauseants
sedens
melius
in
that
of
the
espards
partem
in
that
of
the
vandenesses

and
what
elegance
in
the
thousand
details
of
the
learned
symbolism
which
will
always
show
how
far
accuracy
has
been
carried
in
my
work
to
which
you

of
the

to

floods
the
flats
at
the
foot
of
these
slopes
leaving
a
yellow
alluvium
that
is
extremely
fertile
excepting
in
those
places
where
it
has
deluged
them
with
sand
and
destroyed
them
forever
by
one
of
those
terrible
risings
which
are
also
incidental
to
the
vistula
the
loire
of
the
northern
coast
the
hill
on
which
the
houses
of
sancerre
are
grouped
is
so
far
from
the
river
that
the
little
of
thrives
on
the
life
of
sancerre
there
wine
is
shipped
and
oak
staves
are
landed
with
all
the
produce
brought
from
the
upper
and
lower
loire
at
the
period
when
this
story
begins
the
suspension
bridges
at
cosne
and
at
were
already
built
travelers
from
paris
to
sancerre
by
the
southern
road
were
no
longer
ferried
across
the
river
from
cosne
to
and
this
of
itself
is
enough
to
show
that
the
great
of
was
a
thing
of
the
past
for
the
house
of
orleans
has
always
had
a
care
for
substantial
improvements
though
somewhat
after
the
fashion
of
a
husband
who
makes
his
wife
presents
out
of
her
marriage
portion
excepting
that
part
of
sancerre
which
occupies
the
little
plateau
the
streets
are
more
or
less
steep
and
the
town
is
surrounded
by
slopes
known
as
the
great
ramparts
a
name
which
shows
that
they
are
the
highroads
of
the
place
outside
the
ramparts
lies
a
belt
of
vineyards
wine
forms
the
chief
industry
and
the
most
important
trade
of
the
country
which
yields
several
vintages
of
wine
full
of
aroma
and
so
nearly
resembling
the
wines
of
burgundy
that
the
vulgar
palate
is
deceived
so
sancerre
finds
in
the
wineshops
of
paris
the
quick
market
indispensable
for
liquor
that
will
not
keep
for
more
than
seven
or
eight
years
below
the
town
lie
a
few
villages
fontenoy
and
almost
suburbs
reminding
us
by
their
situation
of
the
smiling
vineyards
about
neuchatel
in
switzerland
the
town
still
bears
much
of
its
ancient
aspect
the
streets
are
narrow
and
paved
with
pebbles
carted
up
from
the
loire
some
old
houses
are
to
be
seen
there
the
citadel
a
relic
of
military
power
and
feudal
times
stood
one
of
the
most
terrible
sieges
of
our
religious
wars
when
french
calvinists
far
outdid
the
ferocious
cameronians
of
walter
scott
s
tales
the
town
of
sancerre
rich
in
its
greater
past
but
widowed
now
of
its
military
importance
is
doomed
to
an
even
less
glorious
future
for
the
course
of
trade
lies
on
the
right
bank
of
the
loire
the
sketch
here
given
shows
that
sancerre
will
be
left
more
and
more
lonely
in
spite
of
the
two
bridges
connecting
it
with
cosne
sancerre
the
pride
of
the
left
bank
numbers
three
thousand
five
hundred
inhabitants
at
most
while
at
cosne
there
are
now
more
than
six
thousand
within
half
a
century
the
part
played
by
these
two
towns
standing
opposite
each
other
has
been
reversed
the
advantage
of
situation
however
remains
with
the
historic
town
whence
the
view
on
every
side
is
perfectly
enchanting
where
the
air
is
deliciously
pure
the
vegetation
splendid
and
the
residents
in
harmony
with
nature
are
friendly
souls
good
fellows
and
devoid
of
puritanism
though
of
the
population
are
calvinists
under
such
conditions
though
there
are
the
usual
disadvantages
of
life
in
a
small
town
and
each
one
lives
under
the
officious
eye
which
makes
private
life
almost
a
public
concern
on
the
other
hand
the
spirit
of
township
a
sort
of
patriotism
which
can
not
indeed
take
the
place
of
a
love
of
home
flourishes
triumphantly
thus
the
town
of
sancerre
is
exceedingly
proud
of
having
given
birth
to
one
of
the
glories
of
modern
medicine
horace
bianchon
and
to
an
author
of
secondary
rank
etienne
lousteau
one
of
our
most
successful
journalists
the
district
included
under
the
municipality
of
sancerre
distressed
at
finding
itself
practically
ruled
by
seven
or
eight
large
landowners
the
of
the
elections
tried
to
shake
off
the
electoral
yoke
of
a
creed
which
had
reduced
it
to
a
rotten
borough
this
little
conspiracy
plotted
by
a
handful
of
men
whose
vanity
was
provoked
failed
through
the
jealousy
which
the
elevation
of
one
of
them
as
the
inevitable
result
roused
in
the
breasts
of
the
others
this
result
showed
the
radical
defect
of
the
scheme
and
the
remedy
then
suggested
was
to
rally
round
a
champion
at
the
next
election
in
the
person
of
one
of
the
two
men
who
so
gloriously
represented
sancerre
in
paris
circles
this
idea
was
extraordinarily
advanced
for
the
provinces
for
since
the
nomination
of
parochial
dignitaries
has
increased
so
greatly
that
real
statesmen
are
becoming
rare
indeed
in
the
lower
chamber
in
point
of
fact
this
plan
of
very
doubtful
outcome
was
hatched
in
the
brain
of
the
superior
woman
of
the
borough
femina
but
with
a
view
to
personal
interest
this
idea
was
so
widely
rooted
in
this
lady
s
past
life
and
so
entirely
comprehended
her
future
prospects
that
it
can
scarcely
be
understood
without
some
sketch
of
her
antecedent
career
sancerre
at
that
time
could
boast
of
a
superior
woman
long
misprized
indeed
but
now
about
enjoying
a
pretty
extensive
local
reputation
this
too
was
the
period
at
which
two
sancerrois
in
paris
were
attaining
each
in
his
own
line
to
the
highest
degree
of
glory
for
one
and
of
fashion
for
the
other
etienne
lousteau
a
writer
in
reviews
signed
his
name
to
contributions
to
a
paper
that
had
eight
thousand
subscribers
and
bianchon
already
chief
physician
to
a
hospital
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
member
of
the
academy
of
sciences
had
just
been
made
a
professor
if
it
were
not
that
the
word
would
to
many
readers
seem
to
imply
a
degree
of
blame
it
might
be
said
that
george
sand
created
so
true
is
it
that
morally
speaking
all
good
has
a
reverse
of
evil
this
leprosy
of
sentimentality
would
have
been
charming
still
has
its
good
side
in
that
the
woman
attacked
by
it
bases
her
assumption
of
superiority
on
feelings
scorned
she
is
a
of
sentiment
and
she
is
rather
less
of
a
bore
love
to
some
extent
neutralizing
literature
the
most
conspicuous
result
of
george
sand
s
celebrity
was
to
elicit
the
fact
that
france
has
a
perfectly
enormous
number
of
superior
women
who
have
however
till
now
been
so
generous
as
to
leave
the
field
to
the
marechal
de
saxe
s
granddaughter
the
superior
woman
of
sancerre

at
la
baudraye

and
in
one
within
ten
minutes
of
the
town
and
in
the
village
or
if
you
will
the
suburb
of
the
la
baudrayes
of
the
present
day
have
as
is
frequently
the
case
thrust
themselves
in
and
are
but
a
substitute
for
those
la
baudrayes
whose
name
glorious
in
the
crusades
figured
in
the
chief
events
of
the
history
of
le
berry
the
story
must
be
told
in
the
time
of
louis
xiv
a
certain
sheriff
named
milaud
whose
forefathers
had
been
furious
calvinists
was
converted
at
the
time
of
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
to
encourage
this
movement
in
one
of
the
of
calvinism
the
king
gave
said
milaud
a
good
appointment
in
the
waters
and
forests
granted
him
arms
and
the
title
of
sire
or
lord
de
la
baudraye
with
the
fief
of
the
old
and
genuine
la
baudrayes
the
descendants
of
the
famous
captain
la
baudraye
fell
sad
to
say
into
one
of
the
snares
laid
for
heretics
by
the
new
decrees
and
were
hanged
an
unworthy
deed
of
the
great
king
s
under
louis
xv
milaud
de
la
baudraye
from
being
a
mere
squire
was
made
chevalier
and
had
influence
enough
to
obtain
for
his
son
a
cornet
s
commission
in
the
musketeers
this
officer
perished
at
fontenoy
leaving
a
child
to
whom
king
louis
xvi
subsequently
granted
the
privileges
by
patent
of

the
duc
de
nivernais
and
fancied
himself
obliged
to
follow
the
nobility
into
exile
but
he
took
care
to
carry
his
money
with
him
thus
the

able
to
assist
more
than

of

rank

perhaps
tired
of

sancerre
bought
back

out
of
a
feeling
of
vanity
and
imaginary
pride
quite
intelligible
in
a
sheriff
s
grandson
though
under
the
consulate
his
prospects
were
but
slender
all
the
more
so
indeed
because
the
had
small
hopes
of
his
heir

perpetuating
the
new
race
of

jean
athanase
polydore
milaud
de
la
baudraye
his
only
son
more
than
delicate
from
his
birth
was
very
evidently
the
child
of
a
man
whose
constitution
had
early
been
exhausted
by
the
excesses
in
which
rich
men
indulge
who
then
marry
at
the
first
stage
of
premature
old
age
and
thus
bring
degeneracy
into
the
highest
circles
of
society
during
the
years
of
the
emigration
madame
de
la
baudraye
a
girl
of
no
fortune
chosen
for
her
noble
birth
had
patiently
reared
this
sallow
sickly
boy
for
whom
she
had
the
devoted
love
mothers

for
such
changeling
creatures
her
death
she
was
a
casteran
de
la
tour
contributed
to
bring
about
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
s
return
to
france
this
lucullus
of
the
milauds
when
he
died
left
his
son

fief
stripped
indeed
of
its
fines
and
dues
but
graced
with

considerable
sum
of

and

in
a
pocketbook
full
of
verses
with
this
inscription
on
the
wrapper
vanitatum
et
omnia
young
la
baudraye
did
not
die
but
he
owed
his
life
to
habits
of
monastic
strictness
to
the
economy
of
action
which
fontenelle
preached
as
the
religion
of
the
invalid
and
above
all
to
the
air
of
sancerre
and
the
influence
of
its
fine
elevation
whence
a
panorama
over
the
valley
of
the
loire
may
be
seen
extending
for
forty
leagues
from
to
young
la
baudraye
added
several
plots
to
his
vineyards
and
devoted
himself
to
the
culture
of
the
vine
the
restoration
seemed
to
him
at
first
so
insecure
that
he
dared
not
go
to
paris
to
claim
his
debts
but
after
napoleon
s
death
he
tried
to
turn
his
father
s
collection
of
autographs
into
money
though
not
understanding
the
deep
philosophy
which
had
thus
mixed
up
i
o
u
s
and
copies
of
verses
but
the
winegrower
lost
so
much
time
in
impressing
his
identity
on
the
duke
of
navarreins
and
others
as
he
phrased
it
that
he
came
back
to
sancerre
to
his
beloved
vintage
without
having
obtained
anything
but
offers
of
service
the
restoration
had
raised
the
nobility
to
such
a
degree
of
lustre
as
made
la
baudraye
wish
to
justify
his
ambitions
by
having
an
heir
this
happy
result
of
matrimony
he
considered
doubtful
or
he
would
not
so
long
have
postponed
the
step
however
finding
himself
still
above
ground
in
at
the
age
of
a
length
of
years
which
no
doctor
astrologer
or
midwife
would
have
dared
to
promise
him
he
hoped
to
earn
the
reward
of
his
sober
life
and
yet
his
choice
showed
such
a
lack
of
prudence
in
regard
to
his
frail
constitution
that
the
malicious
wit
of
a
country
town
could
not
help
thinking
it
must
be
the
result
of
some
deep
calculation
just
at
this
time
his
eminence
monseigneur
the
archbishop
of
bourges
had
converted
to
the
catholic
faith
a
young
person
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
citizen
families
who
were
the
first
upholders
of
calvinism
and
who
thanks
to
their
obscurity
or
to
some
compromise
with
heaven
had
escaped
from
the
persecutions
under
louis
xiv
the
piedefers
a
name
that
was
obviously
one
of
the
quaint
nicknames
assumed
by
the
champions
of
the
reformation
had
set
up
as
highly
respectable
cloth
merchants
but
in
the
reign
of
louis
abraham
piedefer
fell
into
difficulties
and
at
his
death
in
left
his
two
children
in
extreme
poverty
one
of
them
tobie
piedefer
went
out
to
the
indies
leaving
the
pittance
they
had
inherited
to
his
elder
brother
during
the
revolution
moise
piedefer
bought
up
the
nationalized
land
pulled
down
abbeys
and
churches
with
all
the
zeal
of
his
ancestors
oddly
enough
and
married
a
catholic
the
only
daughter
of
a
member
of
the
convention
who
had
perished
on
the
scaffold
this
ambitious
piedefer
died
in
leaving
a
little
girl
of
remarkable
beauty
this
child
brought
up
in
the
calvinist
faith
was
named
dinah
in
accordance
with
the
custom
in
use
among
the
sect
of
taking
their
christian
names
from
the
bible
so
as
to
have
nothing
in
common
with
the
saints
of
the
roman
church
mademoiselle
dinah
piedefer
was
placed
by
her
mother
in
one
of
the
best
schools
in
bourges
that
kept
by
the
demoiselles
chamarolles
and
was
soon
as
highly
distinguished
for
the
qualities
of
her
mind
as
for
her
beauty
but
she
found
herself
snubbed
by
girls
of
birth
and
fortune
destined
to
play
a
greater
part
in
the
world
than
a
mere
plebeian
the
daughter
of
a
mother
who
was
dependent
on
the
settlement
of
piedefer
s
estate
dinah
having
raised
herself
for
the
moment
above
her
companions
now
aimed
at
remaining
on
a
level
with
them
for
the
rest
of
her
life
she
determined
therefore
to
renounce
calvinism
in
the
hope
that
the
cardinal
would
extend
his
favor
to
his
proselyte
and
interest
himself
in
her
prospects
you
may
from
this
judge
of
mademoiselle
dinah
s
superiority
since
at
the
age
of
seventeen
she
was
a
convert
solely
from
ambition
the
archbishop
possessed
with
the
idea
that
dinah
piedefer
would
adorn
society
was
anxious
to
see
her
married
but
every
family
to
whom
the
prelate
made
advances
took
fright
at
a
damsel
gifted
with
the
looks
of
a
princess
who
was
reputed
to
be
the
cleverest
of
mademoiselle
chamarolles
pupils
and
who
at
the
somewhat
theatrical
ceremonial
of
always
took
a
leading
part
a
thousand
crowns
a
year
which
was
as
much
as
she
could
hope
for
from
the
estate
of
la
hautoy
when
divided
between
the
mother
and
daughter
would
be
a
mere
trifle
in
comparison
with
the
expenses
into
which
a
husband
would
be
led
by
the
personal
advantages
of
so
brilliant
a
creature
as
soon
as
all
these
facts
came
to
the
ears
of
little
polydore
de
la
baudraye
for
they
were
the
talk
of
every
circle
in
the
department
of
the
cher
he
went
to
bourges
just
when
madame
piedefer
a
devotee
at
high
services
had
almost
made
up
her
own
mind
and
her
daughter
s
to
take
the
first
comer
with
pockets
the
first
as
they
say
in
le
berry
and
if
the
cardinal
was
delighted
to
receive
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
was
even
better
pleased
to
receive
a
wife
from
the
hands
of
the
cardinal
the
little
gentleman
only
demanded
of
his
eminence
a
formal
promise
to
support
his
claims
with
the
president
of
the
council
to
enable
him
to
recover
his
debts
from
the
duc
de
navarreins
and
others
by
a
lien
on
their
indemnities
this
method
however
seemed
to
the
able
minister
then
occupying
the
pavillon
marsan
rather
too
sharp
practice
and
he
gave
the
to
understand
that
his
business
should
be
attended
to
all
in
good
time
it
is
easy
to
imagine
the
excitement
produced
in
the
sancerre
district
by
the
news
of
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
s
imprudent
marriage
it
is
quite
intelligible
said
president
boirouge
the
little
man
was
very
much
startled
as
i
am
told
at
hearing
that
handsome
young
milaud
the
s
deputy
at
nevers
say
to
monsieur
de
clagny
as
they
were
looking
at
the
turrets
of
la
baudraye
that
will
be
mine
some
but
says
clagny
he
may
marry
and
have
impossible
so
you
may
imagine
how
such
a
changeling
as
little
la
baudraye
must
hate
that
colossal
there
was
at
nevers
a
plebeian
branch
of
the
milauds
which
had
grown
so
rich
in
the
cutlery
trade
that
the
present
representative
of
that
branch
had
been
brought
up
to
the
civil
service
in
which
he
had
enjoyed
the
patronage
of
marchangy
now
dead
it
will
be
as
well
to
eliminate
from
this
story
in
which
moral
developments
play
the
principal
part
the
baser
material
interests
which
alone
occupied
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
by
briefly
relating
the
results
of
his
negotiations
in
paris
this
will
also
throw
light
on
certain
mysterious
phenomena
of
contemporary
history
and
the
underground
difficulties
in
matters
of
politics
which
hampered
the
ministry
at
the
time
of
the
restoration
the
promises
of
ministers
were
so
illusory
that
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
determined
on
going
to
paris
at
the
time
when
the
cardinal
s
presence
was
required
there
by
the
sitting
of
the
chambers
this
is
how
the
duc
de
navarreins
the
principal
debtor
threatened
by
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
got
out
of
the
scrape
the
country
gentleman
lodging
at
the
hotel
de
mayence
rue
near
the
place
vendome
one
morning
received
a
visit
from
a
confidential
agent
of
the
ministry
who
was
an
expert
in
winding
up
business
this
elegant
personage
who
stepped
out
of
an
elegant
cab
and
was
dressed
in
the
most
elegant
style
was
requested
to
walk
up
to
no
that
is
to
say
to
the
third
floor
to
a
small
room
where
he
found
his
provincial
concocting
a
cup
of
coffee
over
his
bedroom
fire
is
it
to
monsieur
milaud
de
la
baudraye
that
i
have
the
honor
yes
said
the
little
man
draping
himself
in
his
after
examining
this
garment
the
illicit
offspring
of
an
old
chine
wrapper
of
madame
piedefer
s
and
a
gown
of
the
late
lamented
madame
de
la
baudraye
the
emissary
considered
the
man
the
and
the
little
stove
on
which
the
milk
was
boiling
in
a
tin
saucepan
as
so
homogeneous
and
characteristic
that
he
deemed
it
needless
to
beat
about
the
bush
i
will
lay
a
wager
monsieur
said
he
audaciously
that
you
dine
for
forty
sous
at
hurbain
s
in
the
palais
pray
why
oh
i
know
you
having
seen
you
there
replied
the
parisian
with
perfect
gravity
all
the
princes
creditors
dine
there
you
know
that
you
recover
scarcely
ten
per
cent
on
debts
from
these
fine
gentlemen
i
would
not
give
you
five
per
cent
on
a
debt
to
be
recovered
from
the
estate
of
the
late
duc
d
orleans
nor
even
he
added
in
a
low
voice
from
so
you
have
come
to
buy
up
the
bills
said
la
baudraye
thinking
himself
very
clever
buy
them
said
his
visitor
why
what
do
you
take
me
for
i
am
monsieur
des
lupeaulx
master
of
appeals
to
the
ministry
and
i
have
come
to
propose
an
what
is
that
of
course
monsieur
you
know
the
position
of
your
debtor
of
my
debtors
well
monsieur
you
understand
the
position
of
your
debtors
they
stand
high
in
the
king
s
good
graces
but
they
have
no
money
and
are
obliged
to
make
a
good
again
you
know
the
difficulties
of
the
political
situation
the
aristocracy
has
to
be
rehabilitated
in
the
face
of
a
very
strong
force
of
the
third
estate
the
king
s
idea
and
france
does
him
scant
justice
is
to
create
a
peerage
as
a
national
institution
analogous
to
the
english
peerage
to
realize
this
grand
idea
we
need
years
and
the
duc
de
navarreins
who
is
as
you
know
first
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
to
the
king
does
not
repudiate
his
debt
but
he
can
not
now
be
consider
the
state
of
politics
we
are
emerging
from
the
pit
of
the
and
you
yourself
are
noble
he
simply
can
not
pay
monsieur
you
are
hasty
said
des
lupeaulx
listen
he
can
not
pay
in
money
well
then
you
a
clever
man
can
take
payment
in
favors
royal
or
what
when
in
my
father
put
down
one
hundred
thousand
my
dear
sir
recrimination
is
useless
listen
to
a
simple
statement
in
political
arithmetic
the
collectorship
at
sancerre
is
vacant
a
certain
of
the
forces
has
a
claim
on
it
but
he
has
no
chance
of
getting
it
you
have
the
chance
and
no
claim
you
will
get
the
place
you
will
hold
it
for
three
months
you
will
then
resign
and
monsieur
gravier
will
give
twenty
thousand
francs
for
it
in
addition
the
order
of
the
legion
of
honor
will
be
conferred
on
well
that
is
something
said
the
tempted
by
the
money
rather
than
by
the
red
ribbon
but
then
said
des
lupeaulx
you
must
show
your
gratitude
to
his
excellency
by
restoring
to
monseigneur
the
duc
de
navarreins
all
your
claims
on
la
baudraye
returned
to
sancerre
as
collector
of
taxes
six
months
later
he
was
superseded
by
monsieur
gravier
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
agreeable
financiers
who
had
served
under
the
empire
and
who
was
of
course
presented
by
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
to
his
wife
as
soon
as
he
was
released
from
his
functions
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
returned
to
paris
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
some
other
debtors
this
time
he
was
made
a
referendary
under
the
great
seal
baron
and
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
he
sold
the
appointment
as
referendary
and
then
the
baron
de
la
baudraye
called
on
his
last
remaining
debtors
and
reappeared
at
sancerre
as
master
of
appeals
with
an
appointment
as
royal
commissioner
to
a
commercial
association
established
in
the
nivernais
at
a
salary
of
six
thousand
francs
an
absolute
sinecure
so
the
worthy
la
baudraye
who
was
supposed
to
have
committed
a
financial
blunder
had
in
fact
done
very
good
business
in
the
choice
of
a
wife
thanks
to
sordid
economy
and
an
indemnity
paid
him
for
the
estate
belonging
to
his
father
nationalized
and
sold
in
by
the
year
the
little
man
could
realize
the
dream
of
his
whole
life
by
paying
four
hundred
thousand
francs
down
and
binding
himself
to
further
instalments
which
compelled
him
to
live
for
six
years
on
the
air
as
it
came
to
use
his
own
expression
he
was
able
to
purchase
the
estate
of
anzy
on
the
banks
of
the
loire
about
two
leagues
above
sancerre
and
its
magnificent
castle
built
by
philibert
de
l
orme
the
admiration
of
every
connoisseur
and
for
five
centuries
the
property
of
the
uxelles
family
at
last
he
was
one
of
the
great
landowners
of
the
province
it
is
not
absolutely
certain
that
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
an
entail
had
been
created
by
letters
patent
dated
back
to
december
including
the
estates
of
anzy
of
la
baudraye
and
of
la
hautoy
was
any
compensation
to
dinah
on
finding
herself
reduced
to
unconfessed
penuriousness
till
this
sketch
of
the
financial
policy
of
the
first
baron
de
la
baudraye
explains
the
man
completely
those
who
are
familiar
with
the
manias
of
country
folks
will
recognize
in
him
the
which
becomes
such
a
consuming
passion
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
a
sort
of
avarice
displayed
in
the
sight
of
the
sun
which
often
leads
to
ruin
by
a
want
of
balance
between
the
interest
on
mortgages
and
the
products
of
the
soil
those
who
from
till
had
merely
laughed
at
the
little
man
as
they
saw
him
trotting
to
and
attending
to
his
business
like
a
merchant
living
on
his
vineyards
found
the
answer
to
the
riddle
when
the
seized
his
prey
after
waiting
for
the
day
when
the
extravagance
of
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
culminated
in
the
sale
of
that
splendid
property
madame
piedefer
came
to
live
with
her
daughter
the
combined
fortunes
of
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
and
his
who
had
been
content
to
accept
an
annuity
of
twelve
hundred
francs
on
the
lands
of
la
hautoy
which
she
handed
over
to
him
amounted
to
an
acknowledged
income
of
about
fifteen
thousand
francs
during
the
early
days
of
her
married
life
dinah
had
effected
some
alterations
which
had
made
the
house
at
la
baudraye
a
very
pleasant
residence
she
turned
a
spacious
forecourt
into
a
formal
garden
pulling
down
presses
and
shabby
outhouses
behind
the
which
though
small
did
not
lack
style
with
its
turrets
and
gables
she
laid
out
a
second
garden
with
shrubs
and
lawns
and
divided
it
from
the
vineyards
by
a
wall
hidden
under
creepers
she
also
made
everything
within
doors
as
comfortable
as
their
narrow
circumstances
allowed
in
order
not
to
be
ruined
by
a
young
lady
so
very
superior
as
dinah
seemed
to
be
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
was
shrewd
enough
to
say
nothing
as
to
the
recovery
of
debts
in
paris
this
dead
secrecy
as
to
his
money
matters
gave
a
touch
of
mystery
to
his
character
and
lent
him
dignity
in
his
wife
s
eyes
during
the
first
years
of
their
married
life
so
majestic
is
silence
the
alterations
effected
at
la
baudraye
made
everybody
eager
to
see
the
young
mistress
all
the
more
so
because
dinah
would
never
show
herself
nor
receive
any
company
before
she
felt
quite
settled
in
her
home
and
had
thoroughly
studied
the
inhabitants
and
above
all
her
taciturn
husband
when
one
spring
morning
in
pretty
madame
de
la
baudraye
was
first
seen
walking
on
the
mall
in
a
blue
velvet
dress
with
her
mother
in
black
velvet
there
was
quite
an
excitement
in
sancerre
this
dress
confirmed
the
young
woman
s
reputation
for
superiority
brought
up
as
she
had
been
in
the
capital
of
le
berry
every
one
was
afraid
lest
in
entertaining
this
phoenix
of
the
department
the
conversation
should
not
be
clever
enough
and
of
course
everybody
was
constrained
in
the
presence
of
madame
de
la
baudraye
who
produced
a
sort
of
terror
among
the
as
they
admired
a
carpet
of
indian
in
the
la
baudraye
a
pompadour
carved
and
gilt
brocade
window
curtains
and
a
japanese
bowl
full
of
flowers
on
the
round
table
among
a
selection
of
the
newest
books
when
they
heard
the
fair
dinah
playing
at
sight
without
making
the
smallest
demur
before
seating
herself
at
the
piano
the
idea
they
conceived
of
her
superiority
assumed
vast
proportions
that
she
might
never
allow
herself
to
become
careless
or
the
victim
of
bad
taste
dinah
had
determined
to
keep
herself
up
to
the
mark
as
to
the
fashions
and
latest
developments
of
luxury
by
an
active
correspondence
with
anna
grossetete
her
bosom
friend
at
mademoiselle
chamarolles
school
anna
thanks
to
a
fine
fortune
had
married
the
comte
de
fontaine
s
third
son
thus
those
ladies
who
visited
at
la
baudraye
were
perpetually
piqued
by
dinah
s
success
in
leading
the
fashion
do
what
they
would
they
were
always
behind
or
as
they
say
on
the
turf
distanced
while
all
these
trifles
gave
rise
to
malignant
envy
in
the
ladies
of
sancerre
dinah
s
conversation
and
wit
engendered
absolute
aversion
in
her
ambition
to
keep
her
mind
on
the
level
of
parisian
brilliancy
madame
de
la
baudraye
allowed
no
vacuous
small
talk
in
her
presence
no
compliments
no
pointless
remarks
she
would
never
endure
the
yelping
of
the
backstairs
slander
which
forms
the
staple
of
talk
in
the
country
she
liked
to
hear
of
discoveries
in
science
or
art
or
the
latest
pieces
at
the
theatres
the
newest
poems
and
by
airing
the
cant
words
of
the
day
she
made
a
show
of
uttering
thoughts
the
abbe
duret
cure
of
sancerre
an
old
man
of
a
lost
type
of
clergy
in
france
a
man
of
the
world
with
a
liking
for
cards
had
not
dared
to
indulge
this
taste
in
so
liberal
a
district
as
sancerre
he
therefore
was
delighted
at
madame
de
la
baudraye
s
coming
and
they
got
on
together
to
admiration
the
one
vicomte
de
chargeboeuf
was
delighted
to
find
in
madame
de
la
baudraye
s
a
sort
of
oasis
where
there
was
a
truce
to
provincial
life
as
to
monsieur
de
clagny
the
public
prosecutor
his
admiration
for
the
fair
dinah
kept
him
bound
to
sancerre
the
enthusiastic
lawyer
refused
all
promotion
and
became
a
quite
pious
adorer
of
this
angel
of
grace
and
beauty
he
was
a
tall
lean
man
with
a
minatory
countenance
set
off
by
terrible
eyes
in
deep
black
circles
under
enormous
eyebrows
and
his
eloquence
very
unlike
his
could
be
incisive
monsieur
gravier
was
a
little
round
man
who
in
the
days
of
the
empire
had
been
a
charming
it
was
this
accomplishment
that
had
won
him
the
high
position
of
of
the
forces
having
mixed
himself
up
in
certain
important
matters
in
spain
with
generals
at
that
time
in
opposition
he
had
made
the
most
of
these
connections
to
the
minister
who
in
consideration
of
the
place
he
had
lost
promised
him
the
receivership
at
sancerre
and
then
allowed
him
to
pay
for
the
appointment
the
frivolous
spirit
and
light
tone
of
the
empire
had
become
ponderous
in
monsieur
gravier
he
did
not
or
would
not
understand
the
wide
difference
between
manners
under
the
restoration
and
under
the
empire
still
he
conceived
of
himself
as
far
superior
to
monsieur
de
clagny
his
style
was
in
better
taste
he
followed
the
fashion
was
to
be
seen
in
a
buff
waistcoat
gray
trousers
and
neat
coats
he
wore
a
fashionable
silk
tie
slipped
through
a
diamond
ring
while
the
lawyer
never
dressed
in
anything
but
black
coat
trousers
and
waistcoat
alike
and
those
often
shabby
these
four
men
were
the
first
to
go
into
ecstasies
over
dinah
s
cultivation
good
taste
and
refinement
and
pronounced
her
a
woman
of
most
superior
mind
then
the
women
said
to
each
other
madame
de
la
baudraye
must
laugh
at
us
behind
our
this
view
which
was
more
or
less
correct
kept
them
from
visiting
at
la
baudraye
dinah
attainted
and
convicted
of
pedantry
because
she
spoke
grammatically
was
nicknamed
the
sappho
of
at
last
everybody
made
insolent
game
of
the
great
qualities
of
the
woman
who
had
thus
roused
the
enmity
of
the
ladies
of
sancerre
and
they
ended
by
denying
a
superiority
after
all
merely
comparative
which
emphasized
their
ignorance
and
did
not
forgive
it
where
the
whole
population
is
a
straight
shape
is
the
monstrosity
dinah
was
regarded
as
monstrous
and
dangerous
and
she
found
herself
in
a
desert
astonished
at
seeing
the
women
of
the
neighborhood
only
at
long
intervals
and
for
visits
of
a
few
minutes
dinah
asked
monsieur
de
clagny
the
reason
of
this
state
of
things
you
are
too
superior
a
woman
to
be
liked
by
other
women
said
the
lawyer
monsieur
gravier
when
questioned
by
the
forlorn
fair
only
after
much
entreaty
replied
well
lady
fair
you
are
not
satisfied
to
be
merely
charming
you
are
clever
and
well
educated
you
know
every
book
that
comes
out
you
love
poetry
you
are
a
musician
and
you
talk
delightfully
women
can
not
forgive
so
much
men
said
to
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
you
who
have
such
a
superior
woman
for
a
wife
are
very
fortunate
and
at
last
he
himself
would
say
i
who
have
a
superior
woman
for
a
wife
am
very
fortunate
etc
madame
piedefer
flattered
through
her
daughter
also
allowed
herself
to
say
such
things
my
daughter
who
is
a
very
superior
woman
was
writing
yesterday
to
madame
de
fontaine
such
and
such
a
those
who
know
the
world
france
paris
know
how
true
it
is
that
many
celebrities
are
thus
created
two
years
later
by
the
end
of
the
year
dinah
de
la
baudraye
was
accused
of
not
choosing
to
have
any
visitors
but
men
then
it
was
said
that
she
did
not
care
for
women
and
that
was
a
crime
not
a
thing
could
she
do
not
her
most
trifling
action
could
escape
criticism
and
misrepresentation
after
making
every
sacrifice
that
a
woman
can
make
and
placing
herself
entirely
in
the
right
madame
de
la
baudraye
was
so
rash
as
to
say
to
a
false
friend
who
condoled
with
her
on
her
isolation
i
would
rather
have
my
bowl
empty
than
with
anything
in
it
this
speech
produced
a
terrible
effect
on
sancerre
and
was
cruelly
retorted
on
the
sappho
of
when
seeing
her
childless
after
five
years
of
married
life
de
la
baudraye
became
a
byword
for
laughter
to
understand
this
provincial
witticism
readers
may
be
reminded
of
the
bailli
de
ferrette
some
no
doubt
having
known
him
of
whom
it
was
said
that
he
was
the
bravest
man
in
europe
for
daring
to
walk
on
his
legs
and
who
was
accused
of
putting
lead
in
his
shoes
to
save
himself
from
being
blown
away
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
a
sallow
and
almost
diaphanous
creature
would
have
been
engaged
by
the
bailli
de
ferrette
as
first
if
that
diplomatist
had
been
the
grand
duke
of
baden
instead
of
being
merely
his
envoy
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
whose
legs
were
so
thin
that
for
mere
decency
he
wore
false
calves
whose
thighs
were
like
the
arms
of
an
average
man
whose
body
was
not
unlike
that
of
a
cockchafer
would
have
been
an
advantageous
foil
to
the
bailli
de
ferrette
as
he
walked
the
little
s
often
twisted
round
on
to
his
shins
so
little
did
he
make
a
secret
of
them
and
he
would
thank
any
one
who
warned
him
of
this
little
mishap
he
wore
black
silk
stockings
and
a
white
waistcoat
till
after
his
marriage
he
adopted
blue
trousers
and
boots
with
heels
which
made
sancerre
declare
that
he
had
added
two
inches
to
his
stature
that
he
might
come
up
to
his
wife
s
chin
for
ten
years
he
was
always
seen
in
the
same
little
coat
with
large
buttons
and
a
black
stock
that
accentuated
his
cold
stingy
face
lighted
up
by
eyes
as
keen
and
passionless
as
a
cat
s
being
very
gentle
as
men
are
who
act
on
a
fixed
plan
of
conduct
he
seemed
to
make
his
wife
happy
by
never
contradicting
her
he
allowed
her
to
do
the
talking
and
was
satisfied
to
move
with
the
deliberate
tenacity
of
an
insect
dinah
adored
for
her
beauty
in
which
she
had
no
rival
and
admired
for
her
cleverness
by
the
most
gentlemanly
men
of
the
place
encouraged
their
admiration
by
conversations
for
which
it
was
subsequently
asserted
she
prepared
herself
beforehand
finding
herself
listened
to
with
rapture
she
soon
began
to
listen
to
herself
enjoyed
haranguing
her
audience
and
at
last
regarded
her
friends
as
the
chorus
in
a
tragedy
there
only
to
give
her
her
cues
in
fact
she
had
a
very
fine
collection
of
phrases
and
ideas
derived
either
from
books
or
by
assimilating
the
opinions
of
her
companions
and
thus
became
a
sort
of
mechanical
instrument
going
off
on
a
round
of
phrases
as
soon
as
some
chance
remark
released
the
spring
to
do
her
justice
dinah
was
choke
full
of
knowledge
and
read
everything
even
medical
books
statistics
science
and
jurisprudence
for
she
did
not
know
how
to
spend
her
days
when
she
had
reviewed
her
and
given
her
orders
to
the
gardener
gifted
with
an
excellent
memory
and
the
talent
which
some
women
have
for
hitting
on
the
right
word
she
could
talk
on
any
subject
with
the
lucidity
of
a
studied
style
and
so
men
came
from
cosne
from
la
charite
and
from
nevers
on
the
right
bank
from
lere
vailly
argent
blancafort
and
aubigny
on
the
left
bank
to
be
introduced
to
madame
de
la
baudraye
as
they
used
in
switzerland
to
be
introduced
to
madame
de
stael
those
who
only
once
heard
the
round
of
tunes
emitted
by
this
musical
went
away
amazed
and
told
such
wonders
of
dinah
as
made
all
the
women
jealous
for
ten
leagues
round
there
is
an
indescribable
mental
headiness
in
the
admiration
we
inspire
or
in
the
effect
of
playing
a
part
which
fends
off
criticism
from
reaching
the
idol
an
atmosphere
produced
perhaps
by
unceasing
nervous
tension
forms
a
sort
of
halo
through
which
the
world
below
is
seen
how
otherwise
can
we
account
for
the
perennial
good
faith
which
leads
to
so
many
repeated
presentments
of
the
same
effects
and
the
constant
ignoring
of
warnings
given
by
children
such
a
terror
to
their
parents
or
by
husbands
so
familiar
as
they
are
with
the
peacock
airs
of
their
wives
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
had
the
frankness
of
a
man
who
opens
an
umbrella
at
the
first
drop
of
rain
when
his
wife
was
started
on
the
subject
of
negro
emancipation
or
the
improvement
of
convict
prisons
he
would
take
up
his
little
blue
cap
and
vanish
without
a
sound
in
the
certainty
of
being
able
to
get
to
to
see
off
a
cargo
of
puncheons
and
return
an
hour
later
to
find
the
discussion
approaching
a
close
or
if
he
had
no
business
to
attend
to
he
would
go
for
a
walk
on
the
mall
whence
he
commanded
the
lovely
panorama
of
the
loire
valley
and
take
a
draught
of
fresh
air
while
his
wife
was
performing
a
sonata
in
words
or
a
dialectical
duet
once
fairly
established
as
a
superior
woman
dinah
was
eager
to
prove
her
devotion
to
the
most
remarkable
creations
of
art
she
threw
herself
into
the
propaganda
of
the
romantic
school
including
under
art
poetry
and
painting
literature
and
sculpture
furniture
and
the
opera
thus
she
became
a
mediaevalist
she
was
also
interested
in
any
treasures
that
dated
from
the
renaissance
and
employed
her
allies
as
so
many
devoted
commission
agents
soon
after
she
was
married
she
had
become
possessed
of
the
rougets
furniture
sold
at
issoudun
early
in
she
purchased
some
very
good
things
at
nivernais
and
the
at
the
new
year
and
on
her
birthday
her
friends
never
failed
to
give
her
some
curiosities
these
fancies
found
favor
in
the
eyes
of
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
they
gave
him
an
appearance
of
sacrificing
a
few
crowns
to
his
wife
s
taste
in
point
of
fact
his
land
mania
allowed
him
to
think
of
nothing
but
the
estate
of
anzy
these
antiquities
at
that
time
cost
much
less
than
modern
furniture
by
the
end
of
five
or
six
years
the
the
the
two
and
the
boudoir
which
dinah
had
arranged
on
the
ground
floor
of
la
baudraye
every
spot
even
to
the
staircase
were
crammed
with
masterpieces
collected
in
the
four
adjacent
departments
these
surroundings
which
were
called
by
the
neighbors
were
quite
in
harmony
with
dinah
all
these
marvels
so
soon
to
be
the
rage
struck
the
imagination
of
the
strangers
introduced
to
her
they
came
expecting
something
unusual
and
they
found
their
expectations
surpassed
when
behind
a
bower
of
flowers
they
saw
these
catacombs
full
of
old
things
piled
up
as
sommerard
used
to
pile
them
that
old
mortality
of
furniture
and
then
these
finds
served
as
so
many
springs
which
turned
on
by
a
question
played
off
an
essay
on
jean
goujon
michel
columb
germain
pilon
boulle
van
huysum
and
boucher
the
great
native
painter
of
le

on
brustolone

was

the
thirteenth

and
seventeenth
centuries
on
the
glazes
of
bernard

the
enamels

the
engravings
of
albrecht
durer
whom
she
called
dur
on
illuminations
on
vellum
on
gothic
architecture
early
decorated
flamboyant
and
pure
enough
to
turn
an
old
man
s
brain
and
fire
a
young
man
with
enthusiasm
madame
de
la
baudraye
possessed
with
the
idea
of
waking
up
sancerre
tried
to
form
a
literary
circle
the
presiding
judge
monsieur
boirouge
who
happened
to
have
a
house
and
garden
on
his
hands
part
of
the
property
favored
the
notion
of
this
the
wily
judge
talked
over
the
rules
of
the
society
with
madame
de
la
baudraye
he
proposed
to
figure
as
one
of
the
founders
and
to
let
the
house
for
fifteen
years
to
the
literary
club
by
the
time
it
had
existed
a
year
the
members
were
playing
dominoes
billiards
and
bouillotte
and
drinking
mulled
wine
punch
and
liqueurs
a
few
elegant
little
suppers
were
then
given
and
some
masked
balls
during
the
carnival
as
to
literature
there
were
the
newspapers
politics
and
business
were
discussed
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
was
constantly
there
on
his
wife
s
account
as
she
said
jestingly
this
result
deeply
grieved
the
superior
woman
who
despaired
of
sancerre
and
collected
the
wit
of
the
neighborhood
in
her
own
nevertheless
and
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
messieurs
de
chargeboeuf
gravier
and
de
clagny
of
the
abbe
duret
and
the
two
chief
magistrates
of
a
young
doctor
and
a
young
assistant
judge
all
blind
admirers
of
dinah
s
there
were
occasions
when
weary
of
discussion
they
allowed
themselves
an
excursion
into
the
domain
of
agreeable
frivolity
which
constitutes
the
common
basis
of
worldly
conversation
monsieur
gravier
called
this
from
grave
to
the
abbe
duret
s
rubber
made
another
pleasing
variety
on
the
monologues
of
the
oracle
the
three
rivals
tired
of
keeping
their
minds
up
to
the
level
of
the
high
range
of
discussion
as
they
called
their
conversation
but
not
daring
to
confess
it
would
sometimes
turn
with
ingratiating
hints
to
the
old
priest
monsieur
le
cure
is
dying
for
his
game
they
would
say
the
wily
priest
lent
himself
very
readily
to
the
little
trick
he
protested
we
should
lose
too
much
by
ceasing
to
listen
to
our
inspired
hostess
and
so
he
would
incite
dinah
s
magnanimity
to
take
pity
at
last
on
her
dear
abbe
this
bold
manoeuvre
a
device
of
the
s
was
repeated
with
so
much
skill
that
dinah
never
suspected
her
slaves
of
escaping
to
the
prison
yard
so
to
speak
of
the
cardtable
and
they
would
leave
her
one
of
the
younger
functionaries
to
harry
one
young
landowner
and
the
dandy
of
sancerre
fell
away
from
dinah
s
good
graces
in
consequence
of
some
rash
demonstrations
after
soliciting
the
honor
of
admission
to
this
little
circle
where
he
flattered
himself
he
could
snatch
the
blossom
from
the
constituted
authorities
who
guarded
it
he
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
yawn
in
the
middle
of
an
explanation
dinah
was
favoring
him
with
for
the
fourth
time
it
is
true
of
the
philosophy
of
kant
monsieur
de
la
thaumassiere
the
grandson
of
the
historian
of
le
berry
was
thenceforth
regarded
as
a
man
entirely
bereft
of
soul
and
brains
the
three
devotees
each
submitted
to
these
exorbitant
demands
on
their
mind
and
attention
in
hope
of
a
crowning
triumph
when
at
last
dinah
should
become
human
for
neither
of
them
was
so
bold
as
to
imagine
that
dinah
would
give
up
her
innocence
as
a
wife
till
she
should
have
lost
all
her
illusions
in
when
she
was
surrounded
by
adorers
dinah
completed
her
twentieth
year
and
the
abbe
duret
kept
her
in
a
sort
of
fervid
catholicism
so
her
worshipers
had
to
be
content
to
overwhelm
her
with
little
attentions
and
small
services
only
too
happy
to
be
taken
for
the
of
this
sovereign
lady
by
strangers
admitted
to
spend
an
evening
or
two
at
la
baudraye
madame
de
la
baudraye
is
a
fruit
that
must
be
left
to
this
was
the
opinion
of
monsieur
gravier
who
was
waiting
as
to
the
lawyer
he
wrote
letters
four
pages
long
to
which
dinah
replied
in
soothing
speech
as
she
walked
leaning
on
his
arm
round
and
round
the
lawn
after
dinner
madame
de
la
baudraye
thus
guarded
by
three
passions
and
always
under
the
eye
of
her
pious
mother
escaped
the
malignity
of
slander
it
was
so
evident
to
all
sancerre
that
no
two
of
these
three
men
would
ever
leave
the
third
alone
with
madame
de
la
baudraye
that
their
jealousy
was
a
comedy
to
the
to
reach
from
caesar
s
gate
there
is
a
way
much
shorter
than
that
by
the
ramparts
down
what
is
known
in
mountainous
districts
as
a
called
at
sancerre
or
alley
the
name
is
significant
as
applied
to
a
path
down
the
steepest
part
of
the
hillside
thickly
strewn
with
stones
and
shut
in
by
the
high
banks
of
the
vineyards
on
each
side
by
way
of
the
the
distance
from
sancerre
to
la
baudraye
is
much
abridged
the
ladies
of
the
place
jealous
of
the
sappho
of
were
wont
to
walk
on
the
mall
looking
down
this
longchamp
of
the
bigwigs
whom
they
would
stop
and
engage
in
conversation
sometimes
the
and
sometimes
the
public
prosecutor
and
who
would
listen
with
every
sign
of
impatience
or
uncivil
absence
of
mind
as
the
turrets
of
la
baudraye
are
visible
from
the
mall
many
a
younger
man
came
to
contemplate
the
abode
of
dinah
while
envying
the
ten
or
twelve
privileged
persons
who
might
spend
their
afternoons
with
the
queen
of
the
neighborhood
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
was
not
slow
to
discover
the
advantage
he
as
dinah
s
husband
held
over
his
wife
s
adorers
and
he
made
use
of
them
without
any
disguise
obtaining
a
remission
of
taxes
and
gaining
two
lawsuits
in
every
litigation
he
used
the
public
prosecutor
s
name
with
such
good
effect
that
the
matter
was
carried
no
further
and
like
all
undersized
men
he
was
contentious
and
litigious
in
business
though
in
the
gentlest
manner
at
the
same
time
the
more
certainly
guiltless
she
was
the
less
conceivable
did
madame
de
la
baudraye
s
position
seem
to
the
prying
eyes
of
these
women
frequently
at
the
house
of
the
presidente
de
boirouge
the
ladies
of
a
certain
age
would
spend
a
whole
evening
discussing
the
la
baudraye
household
among
themselves
of
course
they
all
had
suspicions
of
a
mystery
a
secret
such
as
always
interests
women
who
have
had
some
experience
of
life
and
in
fact
at
la
baudraye
one
of
those
slow
and
monotonous
conjugal
tragedies
was
being
played
out
which
would
have
remained
for
ever
unknown
if
the
merciless
scalpel
of
the
nineteenth
century
guided
by
the
insistent
demand
for
novelty
had
not
dissected
the
darkest
corners
of
the
heart
or
at
any
rate
those
which
the
decency
of
past
centuries
left
unopened
and
that
domestic
drama
sufficiently
accounts
for
dinah
s
immaculate
virtue
during
her
early
married
life
a
young
lady
whose
triumphs
at
school
had
been
the
outcome
of
her
pride
and
whose
first
scheme
in
life
had
been
rewarded
by
a
victory
was
not
likely
to
pause
in
such
a
brilliant
career
frail
as
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
might
seem
he
was
really
an
good
match
for
mademoiselle
dinah
piedefer
but
what
was
the
hidden
motive
of
this
country
landowner
when
at
he
married
a
girl
of
seventeen
and
what
could
his
wife
make
out
of
the
bargain
this
was
the
text
of
dinah
s
first
meditations
the
little
man
never
behaved
quite
as
his
wife
expected
to
begin
with
he
allowed
her
to
take
the
five
precious
acres
now
wasted
in
pleasure
grounds
round
la
baudraye
and
paid
almost
with
generosity
the
seven
or
eight
thousand
francs
required
by
dinah
for
improvements
in
the
house
enabling
her
to
buy
the
furniture
at
the
rougets
sale
at
issoudun
and
to
redecorate
her
rooms
in
various
styles
mediaeval
louis
and
pompadour
the
young
wife
found
it
difficult
to
believe
that
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
was
so
miserly
as
he
was
reputed
or
else
she
must
have
great
influence
with
him
the
illusion
lasted
a
year
and
a
half
after
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
s
second
journey
to
paris
dinah
discovered
in
him
the
artic
coldness
of
a
provincial
miser
whenever
money
was
in
question
the
first
time
she
asked
for
supplies
she
played
the
sweetest
of
the
comedies
of
which
eve
invented
the
secret
but
the
little
man
put
it
plainly
to
his
wife
that
he
gave
her
two
hundred
francs
a
month
for
her
personal
expenses
and
paid
madame
piedefer
twelve
hundred
francs
a
year
as
a
charge
on
the
lands
of
la
hautoy
and
that
this
was
two
hundred
francs
a
year
more
than
was
agreed
to
under
the
marriage
settlement
i
say
nothing
of
the
cost
of
housekeeping
he
said
in
conclusion
you
may
give
your
friends
cake
and
tea
in
the
evening
for
you
must
have
some
amusement
but
i
who
spent
but
fifteen
hundred
francs
a
year
as
a
bachelor
now
spend
six
thousand
including
rates
and
repairs
and
this
is
rather
too
much
in
relation
to
the
nature
of
our
property
a
winegrower
is
never
sure
of
what
his
expenses
may
be
the
making
the
duty
the
casks
while
the
returns
depend
on
a
scorching
day
or
a
sudden
frost
small
owners
like
us
whose
income
is
far
from
being
fixed
must
base
their
estimates
on
their
minimum
for
they
have
no
means
of
making
up
a
deficit
or
a
loss
what
would
become
of
us
if
a
wine
merchant
became
bankrupt
in
my
opinion
promissory
notes
are
so
many
to
live
as
we
are
living
we
ought
always
to
have
a
year
s
income
in
hand
and
count
on
no
more
than
of
our
any
form
of
resistance
is
enough
to
make
a
woman
vow
to
subdue
it
dinah
flung
herself
against
a
will
of
iron
padded
round
with
gentleness
she
tried
to
fill
the
little
man
s
soul
with
jealousy
and
alarms
but
it
was
stockaded
with
insolent
confidence
he
left
dinah
when
he
went
to
paris
with
all
the
conviction
of
medor
in
angelique
s
fidelity
when
she
affected
cold
disdain
to
nettle
this
changeling
by
the
scorn
a
courtesan
sometimes
shows
to
her
protector
and
which
acts
on
him
with
the
certainty
of
the
screw
of
a
winepress
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
gazed
at
his
wife
with
fixed
eyes
like
those
of
a
cat
which
in
the
midst
of
domestic
broils
waits
till
a
blow
is
threatened
before
stirring
from
its
place
the
strange
speechless
uneasiness
that
was
perceptible
under
his
mute
indifference
almost
terrified
the
young
wife
of
twenty
she
could
not
at
first
understand
the
selfish
quiescence
of
this
man
who
might
be
compared
to
a
cracked
pot
and
who
in
order
to
live
regulated
his
existence
with
the
unchangeable
regularity
which
a
clockmaker
requires
of
a
clock
so
the
little
man
always
evaded
his
wife
while
she
always
hit
out
as
it
were
ten
feet
above
his
head
dinah
s
fits
of
fury
when
she
saw
herself
condemned
never
to
escape
from
la
baudraye
and
sancerre
are
more
easily
imagined
than
described
she
who
had
dreamed
of
handling
a
fortune
and
managing
the
dwarf
whom
she
the
giant
had
at
first
humored
in
order
to
command
in
the
hope
of
some
day
making
her
appearance
on
the
greater
stage
of
paris
she
accepted
the
vulgar
incense
of
her
attendant
knights
with
a
view
to
seeing
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
s
name
drawn
from
the
electoral
urn
for
she
supposed
him
to
be
ambitious
after
seeing
him
return
thrice
from
paris
each
time
a
step
higher
on
the
social
ladder
but
when
she
struck
on
the
man
s
heart
it
was
as
though
she
had
tapped
on
marble
the
man
who
had
been
and
referendary
who
was
now
master
of
appeals
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
royal
commissioner
was
but
a
mole
throwing
up
its
little
hills
round
and
round
a
vineyard
then
some
lamentations
were
poured
into
the
heart
of
the
public
prosecutor
of
the
even
of
monsieur
gravier
and
they
all
increased
in
their
devotion
to
this
sublime
victim
for
like
all
women
she
never
mentioned
her
speculative
schemes
and
again
like
all
women
finding
such
speculation
vain
she
ceased
to
speculate
dinah
tossed
by
mental
storms
was
still
undecided
when
in
the
autumn
of
the
news
was
told
of
the
purchase
by
the
baron
de
la
baudraye
of
the
estate
of
anzy
then
the
little
old
man
showed
an
impulsion
of
pride
and
glee
which
for
a
few
months
changed
the
current
of
his
wife
s
ideas
she
fancied
there
was
a
hidden
vein
of
greatness
in
the
man
when
she
found
him
applying
for
a
patent
of
entail
in
his
triumph
the
baron
exclaimed
dinah
you
shall
be
a
countess
yet
there
was
then
a
reunion
between
the
husband
and
wife
such
as
can
never
endure
and
which
only
humiliated
and
fatigued
a
woman
whose
apparent
superiority
was
unreal
while
her
unseen
superiority
was
genuine
this
whimsical
medley
is
commoner
than
people
think
dinah
who
was
ridiculous
from
the
perversity
of
her
cleverness
had
really
great
qualities
of
soul
but
circumstances
did
not
bring
these
rarer
powers
to
light
while
a
provincial
life
debased
the
small
change
of
her
wit
from
day
to
day
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
on
the
contrary
devoid
of
soul
of
strength
and
of
wit
was
fated
to
figure
as
a
man
of
character
simply
by
pursuing
a
plan
of
conduct
which
he
was
too
feeble
to
change
there
was
in
their
lives
a
first
phase
lasting
six
years
during
which
dinah
alas
became
utterly
provincial
in
paris
there
are
several
kinds
of
women
the
duchess
and
the
financier
s
wife
the
ambassadress
and
the
consul
s
wife
the
wife
of
the
minister
who
is
a
minister
and
of
him
who
is
no
longer
a
minister
then
there
is
the
lady
quite
the
lady
of
the
right
bank
of
the
seine
and
of
the
left
but
in
the
country
there
is
but
one
kind
of
woman
and
she
poor
thing
is
the
provincial
woman
this
remark
points
to
one
of
the
sores
of
modern
society
it
must
be
clearly
understood
france
in
the
nineteenth
century
is
divided
into
two
broad
zones
paris
and
the
provinces
the
provinces
jealous
of
paris
paris
never
thinking
of
the
provinces
but
to
demand
money
of
old
paris
was
the
capital
of
the
provinces
and
the
court
ruled
the
capital
now
all
paris
is
the
court
and
all
the
country
is
the
town
however
lofty
beautiful
and
clever
a
girl
born
in
any
department
of
france
may
be
on
entering
life
if
like
dinah
piedefer
she
marries
in
the
country
and
remains
there
she
inevitably
becomes
the
provincial
woman
in
spite
of
every
determination
the
commonplace
of
ideas
indifference
to
dress
the
culture
of
vulgar
people
swamp
the
sublimer
essence
hidden
in
the
youthful
plant
all
is
over
it
falls
into
decay
how
should
it
be
otherwise
from
their
earliest
years
girls
bred
in
the
country
see
none
but
provincials
they
can
not
imagine
anything
superior
their
choice
lies
among
mediocrities
provincial
fathers
marry
their
daughters
to
provincial
sons
crossing
the
races
is
never
thought
of
and
the
brain
inevitably
degenerates
so
that
in
many
country
towns
intellect
is
as
rare
as
the
breed
is
hideous
mankind
becomes
dwarfed
in
mind
and
body
for
the
fatal
principle
of
conformity
of
fortune
governs
every
matrimonial
alliance
men
of
talent
artists
superior
brains
every
bird
of
brilliant
plumage
flies
to
paris
the
provincial
woman
inferior
in
herself
is
also
inferior
through
her
husband
how
is
she
to
live
happy
under
this
crushing
twofold
consciousness
but
there
is
a
third
and
terrible
element
besides
her
congenital
and
conjugal
inferiority
which
contributes
to
make
the
figure
arid
and
gloomy
to
reduce
it
narrow
it
distort
it
fatally
is
not
one
of
the
most
flattering
unctions
a
woman
can
lay
to
her
soul
the
assurance
of
being
something
in
the
existence
of
a
superior
man
chosen
by
herself
wittingly
as
if
to
have
some
revenge
on
marriage
wherein
her
tastes
were
so
little
consulted
but
if
in
the
country
the
husbands
are
inferior
beings
the
bachelors
are
no
less
so
when
a
provincial
wife
commits
her
little
sin
she
falls
in
love
with
some
handsome
native
some
indigenous
dandy
a
youth
who
wears
gloves
and
is
supposed
to
ride
well
but
she
knows
at
the
bottom
of
her
soul
that
her
fancy
is
in
pursuit
of
the
commonplace
more
or
less
well
dressed
dinah
was
preserved
from
this
danger
by
the
idea
impressed
upon
her
of
her
own
superiority
even
if
she
had
not
been
as
carefully
guarded
in
her
early
married
life
as
she
was
by
her
mother
whose
presence
never
weighed
upon
her
till
the
day
when
she
wanted
to
be
rid
of
it
her
pride
and
her
high
sense
of
her
own
destinies
would
have
protected
her
flattered
as
she
was
to
find
herself
surrounded
by
admirers
she
saw
no
lover
among
them
no
man
here
realized
the
poetical
ideal
which
she
and
anna
grossetete
had
been
wont
to
sketch
when
stirred
by
the
involuntary
temptations
suggested
by
the
homage
she
received
she
asked
herself
if
i
had
to
make
a
choice
who
should
it
be
she
owned
to
a
preference
for
monsieur
de
chargeboeuf
a
gentleman
of
good
family
whose
appearance
and
manners
she
liked
but
whose
cold
nature
selfishness
and
narrow
ambition
never
rising
above
a
prefecture
and
a
good
marriage
repelled
her
at
a
word
from
his
family
who
were
alarmed
lest
he
should
be
killed
for
an
intrigue
the
vicomte
had
already
deserted
a
woman
he
had
loved
in
the
town
where
he
previously
had
been
monsieur
de
clagny
on
the
other
hand
the
only
man
whose
mind
appealed
to
hers
whose
ambition
was
founded
on
love
and
who
knew
what
love
means
dinah
thought
perfectly
odious
when
dinah
saw
herself
condemned
to
six
years
residence
at
sancerre
she
was
on
the
point
of
accepting
the
devotion
of
monsieur
le
vicomte
de
chargeboeuf
but
he
was
appointed
to
a
prefecture
and
left
the
district
to
monsieur
de
clagny
s
great
satisfaction
the
new
was
a
married
man
whose
wife
made
friends
with
dinah
the
lawyer
had
now
no
rival
to
fear
but
monsieur
gravier
now
monsieur
gravier
was
the
typical
man
of
forty
of
whom
women
make
use
while
they
laugh
at
him
whose
hopes
they
intentionally
and
remorselessly
encourage
as
we
are
kind
to
a
beast
of
burden
in
six
years
among
all
the
men
who
were
introduced
to
her
from
twenty
leagues
round
there
was
not
one
in
whose
presence
dinah
was
conscious
of
the
excitement
caused
by
personal
beauty
by
a
belief
in
promised
happiness
by
the
impact
of
a
superior
soul
or
the
anticipation
of
a
love
affair
even
an
unhappy
one
thus
none
of
dinah
s
choicest
faculties
had
a
chance
of
developing
she
swallowed
many
insults
to
her
pride
which
was
constantly
suffering
under
the
husband
who
so
calmly
walked
the
stage
as
supernumerary
in
the
drama
of
her
life
compelled
to
bury
her
wealth
of
love
she
showed
only
the
surface
to
the
world
now
and
then
she
would
try
to
rouse
herself
try
to
form
some
manly
resolution
but
she
was
kept
in
leading
strings
by
the
need
for
money
and
so
slowly
and
in
spite
of
the
ambitious
protests
and
grievous
recriminations
of
her
own
mind
she
underwent
the
provincial
metamorphosis
here
described
each
day
took
with
it
a
fragment
of
her
spirited
determination
she
had
laid
down
a
rule
for
the
care
of
her
person
which
she
gradually
departed
from
though
at
first
she
kept
up
with
the
fashions
and
the
little
novelties
of
elegant
life
she
was
obliged
to
limit
her
purchases
by
the
amount
of
her
allowance
instead
of
six
hats
caps
or
gowns
she
resigned
herself
to
one
gown
each
season
she
was
so
much
admired
in
a
certain
bonnet
that
she
made
it
do
duty
for
two
seasons
so
it
was
in
everything
not
unfrequently
her
artistic
sense
led
her
to
sacrifice
the
requirements
of
her
person
to
secure
some
bit
of
gothic
furniture
by
the
seventh
year
she
had
come
so
low
as
to
think
it
convenient
to
have
her
morning
dresses
made
at
home
by
the
best
needlewoman
in
the
neighborhood
and
her
mother
her
husband
and
her
friends
pronounced
her
charming
in
these
inexpensive
costumes
which
did
credit
to
her
taste
her
ideas
were
imitated
as
she
had
no
standard
of
comparison
dinah
fell
into
the
snares
that
surround
the
provincial
woman
if
a
parisian
woman
s
hips
are
too
narrow
or
too
full
her
inventive
wit
and
the
desire
to
please
help
to
find
some
heroic
remedy
if
she
has
some
defect
some
ugly
spot
or
small
disfigurement
she
is
capable
of
making
it
an
adornment
this
is
often
seen
but
the
provincial
woman
never
if
her
waist
is
too
short
and
her
figure
ill
balanced
well
she
makes
up
her
mind
to
the
worst
and
her
adorers
or
they
do
not
adore
her
must
take
her
as
she
is
while
the
parisian
always
insists
on
being
taken
for
what
she
is
not
hence
the
preposterous
bustles
the
audacious
flatness
the
ridiculous
fulness
the
hideous
outlines
ingeniously
displayed
to
which
a
whole
town
will
become
accustomed
but
which
are
so
astounding
when
a
provincial
woman
makes
her
appearance
in
paris
or
among
parisians
dinah
who
was
extremely
slim
showed
it
off
to
excess
and
never
knew
a
dull
moment
when
it
became
ridiculous
when
reduced
by
the
dull
weariness
of
her
life
she
looked
like
a
skeleton
in
clothes
and
her
friends
seeing
her
every
day
did
not
observe
the
gradual
change
in
her
appearance
this
is
one
of
the
natural
results
of
a
provincial
life
in
spite
of
marriage
a
young
woman
preserves
her
beauty
for
some
time
and
the
town
is
proud
of
her
but
everybody
sees
her
every
day
and
when
people
meet
every
day
their
perception
is
dulled
if
like
madame
de
la
baudraye
she
loses
her
color
it
is
scarcely
noticed
or
again
if
she
flushes
a
little
that
is
intelligible
and
interesting
a
little
neglect
is
thought
charming
and
her
face
is
so
carefully
studied
so
well
known
that
slight
changes
are
scarcely
noticed
and
regarded
at
last
as
beauty
when
dinah
ceased
to
have
a
new
dress
with
a
new
season
she
seemed
to
have
made
a
concession
to
the
philosophy
of
the
place
it
is
the
same
with
matters
of
speech
choice
of
words
and
ideas
as
it
is
with
matters
of
feeling
the
mind
can
rust
as
well
as
the
body
if
it
is
not
rubbed
up
in
paris
but
the
thing
on
which
provincialism
most
sets
its
stamp
is
gesture
gait
and
movement
these
soon
lose
the
briskness
which
paris
constantly
keeps
alive
the
provincial
is
used
to
walk
and
move
in
a
world
devoid
of
accident
or
change
there
is
nothing
to
be
avoided
so
in
paris
she
walks
on
as
raw
recruits
do
never
remembering
that
there
may
be
hindrances
for
there
are
none
in
her
way
in
her
native
place
where
she
is
known
where
she
is
always
in
her
place
and
every
one
makes
way
for
her
thus
she
loses
all
the
charm
of
the
unforeseen
and
have
you
ever
noticed
the
effect
on
human
beings
of
a
life
in
common
by
the
ineffaceable
instinct
of
simian
mimicry
they
all
tend
to
copy
each
other
each
one
without
knowing
it
acquires
the
gestures
the
tone
of
voice
the
manner
the
attitudes
the
very
countenance
of
others
in
six
years
dinah
had
sunk
to
the
pitch
of
the
society
she
lived
in
as
she
acquired
monsieur
de
clagny
s
ideas
she
assumed
his
tone
of
voice
she
unconsciously
fell
into
masculine
manners
from
seeing
none
but
men
she
fancied
that
by
laughing
at
what
was
ridiculous
in
them
she
was
safe
from
catching
it
but
as
often
happens
some
hue
of
what
she
laughed
at
remained
in
the
grain
a
parisian
woman
sees
so
many
examples
of
good
taste
that
a
contrary
result
ensues
in
paris
women
learn
to
seize
the
hour
and
moment
when
they
may
appear
to
advantage
while
madame
de
la
baudraye
accustomed
to
take
the
stage
acquired
an
indefinable
theatrical
and
domineering
manner
the
air
of
a
coming
forward
on
the
boards
of
which
ironical
smiles
would
soon
have
cured
her
in
the
capital
but
after
she
had
acquired
this
stock
of
absurdities
and
deceived
by
her
worshipers
imagined
them
to
be
added
graces
a
moment
of
terrible
awakening
came
upon
her
like
the
fall
of
an
avalanche
from
a
mountain
in
one
day
she
was
crushed
by
a
frightful
comparison
in
after
the
departure
of
monsieur
de
chargeboeuf
she
was
excited
by
the
anticipation
of
a
little
pleasure
she
was
expecting
the
baronne
de
fontaine
anna
s
husband
who
was
now
under
the
minister
of
finance
took
advantage
of
leave
of
absence
on
the
occasion
of
his
father
s
death
to
take
his
wife
to
italy
anna
wished
to
spend
the
day
at
sancerre
with
her
this
meeting
was
strangely
disastrous
anna
who
at
school
had
been
far
less
handsome
than
dinah
now
as
baronne
de
fontaine
was
a
thousand
times
handsomer
than
the
baronne
de
la
baudraye
in
spite
of
her
fatigue
and
her
traveling
dress
anna
stepped
out
of
an
elegant
traveling
chaise
loaded
with
paris
milliners
boxes
and
she
had
with
her
a
lady
s
maid
whose
airs
quite
frightened
dinah
all
the
difference
between
a
woman
of
paris
and
a
provincial
was
at
once
evident
to
dinah
s
intelligent
eye
she
saw
herself
as
her
friend
saw
her
and
anna
found
her
altered
beyond
recognition
anna
spent
six
thousand
francs
a
year
on
herself
alone
as
much
as
kept
the
whole
household
at
la
baudraye
in
hours
the
friends
had
exchanged
many
confidences
and
the
parisian
seeing
herself
so
far
superior
to
the
phoenix
of
mademoiselle
chamarolles
school
showed
her
provincial
friend
such
kindness
such
attentions
while
giving
her
certain
explanations
as
were
so
many
stabs
to
dinah
though
she
perfectly
understood
that
anna
s
advantages
all
lay
on
the
surface
while
her
own
were
for
ever
buried
when
anna
had
left
madame
de
la
baudraye
by
this
time
fell
into
the
depths
of
despair
what
is
it
that
ails
you
asked
monsieur
de
clagny
seeing
her
so
dejected
anna
said
she
has
learned
to
live
while
i
have
been
learning
to
a
was
in
fact
being
enacted
in
madame
de
la
baudraye
s
house
in
harmony
with
her
struggles
over
money
matters
and
her
successive
transformations
a
drama
to
which
no
one
but
monsieur
de
clagny
and
the
abbe
duret
ever
knew
the
clue
when
dinah
in
sheer
idleness
or
perhaps
sheer
vanity
revealed
the
secret
of
her
anonymous
fame
though
a
mixture
of
verse
and
prose
is
a
monstrous
anomaly
in
french
literature
there
must
be
exceptions
to
the
rule
this
tale
will
be
one
of
the
two
instances
in
these
studies
of
violation
of
the
laws
of
narrative
for
to
give
a
just
idea
of
the
unconfessed
struggle
which
may
excuse
though
it
can
not
absolve
dinah
it
is
necessary
to
give
an
analysis
of
a
poem
which
was
the
outcome
of
her
deep
despair
her
patience
and
her
resignation
alike
broken
by
the
departure
of
the
vicomte
de
chargeboeuf
dinah
took
the
worthy
abbe
s
advice
to
exhale
her
evil
thoughts
in
verse
a
proceeding
which
perhaps
accounts
for
some
poets
you
will
find
such
relief
as
those
who
write
epitaphs
or
elegies
over
those
whom
they
have
lost
pain
is
soothed
in
the
heart
as
lines
surge
up
in
the
this
strange
production
caused
a
great
ferment
in
the
departments
of
the
allier
the
nievre
and
the
cher
proud
to
possess
a
poet
capable
of
rivalry
with
the
glories
of
paris
la
by
was
published
in
the
du
a
review
which
for
eighteen
months
maintained
its
existence
in
spite
of
provincial
indifference
some
knowing
persons
at
nevers
declared
that
jan
diaz
was
making
fun
of
the
new
school
just
then
bringing
out
its
eccentric
verse
full
of
vitality
and
imagery
and
of
brilliant
effects
produced
by
defying
the
muse
under
pretext
of
adapting
german
english
and
romanesque
mannerisms
the
poem
began
with
this
ballad
ah
if
you
knew
the
fragrant
plain
the
air
the
sky
of
golden
spain
its
fervid
noons
its
balmy
spring
sad
daughters
of
the
northern
gloom
of
love
of
heav
n
of
native
home
you
never
would
presume
to
sing
for
men
are
there
of
other
mould
than
those
who
live
in
this
dull
cold
and
there
to
music
low
and
sweet
sevillian
maids
from
eve
till
dawn
dance
lightly
on
the
moonlit
lawn
in
satin
shoes
on
dainty
feet
ah
you
would
be
the
first
to
blush
over
your
dancers
romp
and
rush
and
your
too
hideous
carnival
that
turns
your
cheeks
all
chill
and
blue
and
skips
the
mud
in
d
shoe
a
truly
dismal
festival
to
girls
and
in
a
squalid
room
paquita
sang
the
murky
town
beneath
was
rouen
whence
the
slender
spires
rise
to
chew
the
storm
with
teeth
rouen
so
hideous
noisy
full
of
rage
and
here
followed
a
magnificent
description
of
rouen
where
dinah
had
never
been
written
with
the
affected
brutality
which
a
little
later
inspired
so
many
imitations
of
juvenal
a
contrast
drawn
between
the
life
of
a
manufacturing
town
and
the
careless
life
of
spain
between
the
love
of
heaven
and
of
human
beauty
and
the
worship
of
machinery
in
short
between
poetry
and
sordid
then
jan
diaz
accounted
for
paquita
s
horror
of
normandy
by
saying
seville
you
see
had
been
her
native
home
seville
where
skies
are
blue
and
evening
sweet
she
at
thirteen
the
sovereign
of
the
town
had
lovers
at
her
feet
for
her
three
toreadors
had
gone
to
death
or
victory
the
prize
to
be
a
kiss
one
kiss
from
those
red
lips
of
sweetest
breath
a
touch
of
bliss
the
features
of
the
spanish
girl
s
portrait
have
served
so
often
as
those
of
the
courtesan
in
so
many
that
it
would
be
tiresome
to
quote
here
the
hundred
lines
of
description
to
judge
of
the
lengths
to
which
audacity
had
carried
dinah
it
will
be
enough
to
give
the
conclusion
according
to
madame
de
la
baudraye
s
ardent
pen
paquita
was
so
entirely
created
for
love
that
she
can
hardly
have
met
with
a
knight
worthy
of
her
for
in
her
passionate
fire
every
man
would
have
swooned
from
the
heat
when
she
at
love
s
feast
in
her
fervid
desire
as
yet
had
but
taken
her
seat
and
yet
she
could
quit
the
joys
of
seville
its
woods
and
fields
of
for
a
norman
soldier
who
won
her
love
and
carried
her
away
to
his
hearth
and
home
she
did
not
weep
for
her
andalusia
the
soldier
was
her
whole
joy
but
the
day
came
when
he
was
compelled
to
start
for
russia
in
the
footsteps
of
the
great
nothing
could
be
more
dainty
than
the
description
of
the
parting
between
the
spanish
girl
and
the
normandy
captain
of
artillery
who
in
the
delirium
of
passion
expressed
with
feeling
worthy
of
byron
exacted
from
paquita
a
vow
of
absolute
fidelity
in
the
cathedral
at
rouen
in
front
of
the
alter
of
the
blessed
virgin
who
though
a
maid
is
a
woman
and
never
forgives
when
lovers
are
false
to
their
vows
a
large
part
of
the
poem
was
devoted
to
describing
paquita
s
sufferings
when
alone
in
rouen
waiting
till
the
campaign
was
over
she
stood
writhing
at
the
window
bars
as
she
watched
happy
couples
go
by
she
suppressed
her
passion
in
her
heart
with
a
determination
that
consumed
her
she
lived
on
narcotics
and
exhausted
herself
in
dreams
almost
she
died
but
still
her
heart
was
true
and
when
at
last
her
soldier
came
again
he
found
her
beauty
ever
fresh
and
new
he
had
not
loved
in
vain
but
he
pale
and
frozen
by
the
cold
of
russia
chilled
to
the
very
marrow
met
his
yearning
fair
one
with
a
melancholy
the
whole
poem
was
written
up
to
this
situation
which
was
worked
out
with
such
vigor
and
boldness
as
too
entirely
justified
the
abbe
duret
paquita
on
reaching
the
limits
set
to
real
love
did
not
like
julie
and
heloise
throw
herself
into
the
ideal
no
she
rushed
into
the
paths
of
vice
which
is
no
doubt
shockingly
natural
but
she
did
it
without
any
touch
of
magnificence
for
lack
of
means
as
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
in
rouen
men
impassioned
enough
to
place
paquita
in
a
suitable
setting
of
luxury
and
splendor
this
horrible
realism
emphasized
by
gloomy
poetic
feeling
had
inspired
some
passages
such
as
modern
poetry
is
too
free
with
rather
too
like
the
flayed
anatomical
figures
known
to
artists
as
then
by
a
highly
philosophical
revulsion
after
describing
the
house
of
where
the
andalusian
ended
her
days
the
writer
came
back
to
the
ballad
at
the
opening
paquita
now
is
faded
shrunk
and
old
but
she
it
was
who
sang
if
you
but
knew
the
fragrant
plain
the
air
the
sky
of
golden
spain
etc
the
gloomy
vigor
of
this
poem
running
to
about
six
hundred
lines
and
serving
as
a
powerful
foil
to
use
a
painter
s
word
to
the
two
at
the
beginning
and
end
the
masculine
utterance
of
inexpressible
grief
alarmed
the
woman
who
found
herself
admired
by
three
departments
under
the
black
cloak
of
the
anonymous
while
she
fully
enjoyed
the
intoxicating
delights
of
success
dinah
dreaded
the
malignity
of
provincial
society
where
more
than
one
woman
if
the
secret
should
slip
out
would
certainly
find
points
of
resemblance
between
the
writer
and
paquita
reflection
came
too
late
dinah
shuddered
with
shame
at
having
made
copy
of
some
of
her
woes

no
more

abbe
duret
you
will
cease
to
be

nevers
bourges
were
searched
to
find
jan
diaz
but
dinah
was
impenetrable
to
remove
any
evil
impression
in
case
any
unforeseen
chance
should
betray
her
name
she
wrote
a
charming
poem
in
two
cantos
on
a
legend
of
the
nivernais
once
upon
a
time
the
folks
of
nevers
and
the
folks
of
at
war
with
each
other
came
at
daybreak
to
fight
a
battle
in
which
one
or
other
should
perish
and
met
in
the
forest
of
faye
and
then
there
stood
between
them
under
an
oak
a
priest
whose
aspect
in
the
morning
sun
was
so
commanding
that
the
foes
at
his
bidding
heard

as
he
performed
it

oak

at
the
words
of
the
gospel

made

still
shown
in
the
forest
of

this
poem
immeasurably
superior
to
la
was
far
less
admired
after
these
two
attempts
madame
de
la
baudraye
feeling
herself
a
poet
had
a
light
on
her
brow
and
a
flash
in
her
eyes
that
made
her
handsomer
than
ever
she
cast
longing
looks
at
paris
aspiring
to
fame
and
fell
back
into
her
den
of
la
baudraye
her
daily
squabbles
with
her
husband
and
her
little
circle
where
everybody
s
character
intentions
and
remarks
were
too
well
known
not
to
have
become
a
bore
though
she
found
relief
from
her
dreary
life
in
literary
work
and
poetry
echoed
loudly
in
her
empty
life
though
she
thus
found
an
outlet
for
her
energies
literature
increased
her
hatred
of
the
gray
and
ponderous
provincial
atmosphere
when
after
the
revolution
of
the
glory
of
george
sand
was
reflected
on
le
berry
many
a
town
envied
la
chatre
the
privilege
of
having
given
birth
to
this
rival
of
madame
de
stael
and
camille
maupin
and
were
ready
to
do
homage
to
minor
feminine
talent
thus
there
arose
in
france
a
vast
number
of
tenth
muses
young
girls
or
young
wives
tempted
from
a
silent
life
by
the
bait
of
glory
very
strange
doctrines
were
proclaimed
as
to
the
part
women
should
play
in
society
though
the
sound
common
sense
which
lies
at
the
root
of
the
french
nature
was
not
perverted
women
were
suffered
to
express
ideas
and
profess
opinions
which
they
would
not
have
owned
to
a
few
years
previously
monsieur
de
clagny
took
advantage
of
this
outbreak
of
freedom
to
collect
the
works
of
jan
diaz
in
a
small
volume
printed
by
desroziers
at
moulins
he
wrote
a
little
notice
of
the
author
too
early
snatched
from
the
world
of
letters
which
was
amusing
to
those
who
were
in
the
secret
but
which
even
then
had
not
the
merit
of
novelty
such
practical
jokes
capital
so
long
as
the
author
remains
unknown
fall
rather
flat
if
subsequently
the
poet
stands
confessed
from
this
point
of
view
however
the
memoir
of
jan
diaz
born
at
bourges
in
the
son
of
a
spanish
prisoner
may
very
likely
some
day
deceive
the
compiler
of
some
nothing
is
overlooked
neither
the
names
of
the
professors
at
the
bourges
college
nor
those
of
his
deceased
schoolfellows
such
as
lousteau
bianchon
and
other
famous
natives
of
the
province
who
it
is
said
knew
the
dreamy
melancholy
boy
and
his
precocious
bent
towards
poetry
an
elegy
called

at

a
tale

as
the
work

was
engaged
on
at
the
time
of
his
death
constituted
the
whole
of
these
literary
remains
and
the
poet
s
last
hours
full
of
misery
and
despair
could
not
fail
to
wring
the
hearts
of
the
feeling
public
of
the
nievre
the
bourbonnais
the

and
the

he

two
hundred
copies
were

sold
about
fifty
in

this
average
of
tender
and
poetic
souls
in
three
departments
of
france
is
enough
to
revive
the
enthusiasm
of
writers
as
to
the
which
nowadays
is
more
apt
to
expend
itself
in
business
than
in
books
when
monsieur
de

had
given

in
which
he
credited
him
with
all
the
fine
qualities
we
discover
in
those
who
are
dead
and
buried
lousteau
warned
by
his
who
could
not
remember
jan
diaz
waited
for
information
from
sancerre
and
learned
that
jan
diaz
was
a
pseudonym
assumed
by
a
woman
then
in
and
around
sancerre
madame
de
la
baudraye
became
the
rage
she
was
the
future
rival
of
george
sand
from
sancerre
to
bourges
a
poem
was
praised
which
at
any
other
time
would
certainly
have
been
hooted
the
provincial
public
like
every
french
public
perhaps
does
not
share
the
love
of
the
king
of
the
french
for
the
happy
medium
it
lifts
you
to
the
skies
or
drags
you
in
the
mud
by
this
time
the
good
abbe
madame
de
la
baudraye
s
counselor
was
dead
he
would
certainly
have
prevented
her
rushing
into
public
life
but
three
years
of
work
without
recognition
weighed
on
dinah
s
soul
and
she
accepted
the
clatter
of
fame
as
a
substitute
for
her
disappointed
ambitions
poetry
and
dreams
of
celebrity
which
had
lulled
her
grief
since
her
meeting
with
anna
grossetete
no
longer
sufficed
to
exhaust
the
activity
of
her
morbid
heart
the
abbe
duret
who
had
talked
of
the
world
when
the
voice
of
religion
was
impotent
who
understood
dinah
and
promised
her
a
happy
future
by
assuring
her
that
god
would
compensate
her
for
her
sufferings
bravely
endured
this
good
old
man
could
no
longer
stand
between
the
opening
to
sin
and
the
handsome
young
woman
he
had
called
his
daughter
the
wise
old
priest
had
more
than
once
endeavored
to
enlighten
dinah
as
to
her
husband
s
character
telling
her
that
the
man
could
hate
but
women
are
not
ready
to
believe
in
such
force
in
weak
natures
and
hatred
is
too
constantly
in
action
not
to
be
a
vital
force
dinah
finding
her
husband
incapable
of
love
denied
him
the
power
to
hate
do
not
confound
hatred
and
vengeance
said
the
abbe
they
are
two
different
sentiments
one
is
the
instinct
of
small
minds
the
other
is
the
outcome
of
law
which
great
souls
obey
god
is
avenged
but
he
does
not
hate
hatred
is
a
vice
of
narrow
souls
they
feed
it
with
all
their
meanness
and
make
it
a
pretext
for
sordid
tyranny
so
beware
of
offending
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
he
would
forgive
an
infidelity
because
he
could
make
capital
of
it
but
he
would
be
doubly
implacable
if
you
should
touch
him
on
the
spot
so
cruelly
wounded
by
monsieur
milaud
of
nevers
and
would
make
your
life
now
at
the
time
when
the
whole
countryside
nevers
and
sancerre
le
morvan
and
le
berry
was
priding
itself
on
madame
de
la
baudraye
and
lauding
her
under
the
name
of
jan
diaz
little
la
baudraye
felt
her
glory
a
mortal
blow
he
alone
knew
the
secret
source
of
la
when
this
terrible
work
was
spoken
of
everybody
said
of
dinah
poor
woman
poor
soul
the
women
rejoiced
in
being
able
to
pity
her
who
had
so
long
oppressed
them
never
had
dinah
seemed
to
stand
higher
in
the
eyes
of
the
neighborhood
the
shriveled
old
man
more
wrinkled
yellower
feebler
than
ever
gave
no
sign
but
dinah
sometimes
detected
in
his
eyes
as
he
looked
at
her
a
sort
of
icy
venom
which
gave
the
lie
to
his
increased
politeness
and
gentleness
she
understood
at
last
that
this
was
not
as
she
had
supposed
a
mere
domestic
squabble
but
when
she
forced
an
explanation
with
her
insect
as
monsieur
gravier
called
him
she
found
the
cold
hard
impassibility
of
steel
she
flew
into
a
passion
she
reproached
him
for
her
life
these
eleven
years
past
she
made
intentionally
what
women
call
a
scene
but
little
la
baudraye
sat
in
an
armchair
with
his
eyes
shut
and
listened
phlegmatically
to
the
storm
and
as
usual
the
dwarf
got
the
better
of
his
wife
dinah
saw
that
she
had
done
wrong
in
writing
she
vowed
never
to
write
another
line
and
she
kept
her
vow
then
was
there
desolation
in
the
sancerrois
why
did
not
madame
de
la
baudraye
compose
any
more
verses
was
the
universal
cry
at
this
time
madame
de
la
baudraye
had
no
enemies
every
one
rushed
to
see
her
not
a
week
passed
without
fresh
introductions
the
wife
of
the
presiding
judge
an
august
desired
her
son
a
youth
of
to
pay
his
humble
respects
to
la
baudraye
and
flattered
herself
that
she
might
see
her
gatien
in
the
good
graces
of
this
superior
the
words
superior
woman
had
superseded
the
absurd
nickname
of
sappho
of
this
lady
who
for
nine
years
had
led
the
opposition
was
so
delighted
at
the
good
reception
accorded
to
her
son
that
she
became
loud
in
her
praises
of
the
muse
of
sancerre
after
all
she
exclaimed
in
reply
to
a
tirade
from
madame
de
clagny
who
hated
her
husband
s
supposed
mistress
she
is
the
handsomest
and
cleverest
woman
in
the
whole
province
after
scrambling
through
so
many
brambles
and
setting
off
on
so
many
different
roads
after
dreaming
of
love
in
splendor
and
scenting
the
darkest
dramas
thinking
such
terrible
joys
would
be
cheaply
purchased
so
weary
was
she
of
her
dreary
existence
one
day
dinah
fell
into
the
pit
she
had
sworn
to
avoid
seeing
monsieur
de
clagny
always
sacrificing
himself
and
at
last
refusing
a
high
appointment
in
paris
where
his
family
wanted
to
see
him
she
said
to
herself
he
loves
me
she
vanquished
her
repulsion
and
seemed
willing
to
reward
so
much
constancy
it
was
to
this
impulse
of
generosity
on
her
part
that
a
coalition
was
due
formed
in
sancerre
to
secure
the
return
of
monsieur
de
clagny
at
the
next
elections
madame
de
la
baudraye
had
dreamed
of
going
to
paris
in
the
wake
of
the
new
deputy
but
in
spite
of
the
most
solemn
promises
the
hundred
and
fifty
votes
to
be
recorded
in
favor
of
this
adorer
of
the
lovely
dinah
who
hoped
to
see
this
defender
of
the
widow
and
the
orphan
wearing
the
gown
of
the
keeper
of
the
seals
figured
as
an
imposing
minority
of
fifty
votes
the
jealousy
of
the
president
de
boirouge
and
monsieur
gravier
s
hatred
for
he
believed
in
the
candidate
s
supremacy
in
dinah
s
heart
had
been
worked
upon
by
a
young
and
for
this
worthy
deed
the
allies
got
the
young
man
made
a
prefet
elsewhere
i
shall
never
cease
to
regret
said
he
as
he
quitted
sancerre
that
i
did
not
succeed
in
pleasing
madame
de
la
baudraye
that
would
have
made
my
triumph
complete
the
household
that
was
thus
racked
by
domestic
troubles
was
calm
on
the
surface
here
were
two
but
resigned
beings
and
the
indescribable
propriety
the
lie
that
society
insists
on
and
which
to
dinah
was
an
unendurable
yoke
why
did
she
long
to
throw
off
the
mask
she
had
worn
for
twelve
years
whence
this
weariness
which
every
day
increased
her
hope
of
finding
herself
a
widow
the
reader
who
has
noted
all
the
phases
of
her
existence
will
have
understood
the
various
illusions
by
which
dinah
like
many
another
woman
had
been
deceived
after
an
attempt
to
master
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
she
had
indulged
the
hope
of
becoming
a
mother
between
those
miserable
disputes
over
household
matters
and
the
melancholy
conviction
as
to
her
fate
quite
a
long
time
had
elapsed
then
when
she
had
looked
for
consolation
the
consoler
monsieur
de
chargeboeuf
had
left
her
thus
the
overwhelming
temptation
which
commonly
causes
women
to
sin
had
hitherto
been
absent
for
if
there
are
after
all
some
women
who
make
straight
for
unfaithfulness
are
there
not
many
more
who
cling
to
hope
and
do
not
fall
till
they
have
wandered
long
in
a
labyrinth
of
secret
woes
such
was
dinah
she
had
so
little
impulse
to
fail
in
her
duty
that
she
did
not
care
enough
for
monsieur
de
clagny
to
forgive
him
his
defeat
then
the
move
to
the
chateau
d
anzy
the
rearrangement
of
her
collected
treasures
and
curiosities
which
derived
added
value
from
the
splendid
setting
which
philibert
de
lorme
seemed
to
have
planned
on
purpose
for
this
museum
occupied
her
for
several
months
giving
her
leisure
to
meditate
one
of
those
decisive
steps
that
startle
the
public
ignorant
of
the
motives
which
however
it
sometimes
discovers
by
dint
of
gossip
and
suppositions
madame
de
la
baudraye
had
been
greatly
struck
by
the
reputation
of
lousteau
who
was
regarded
as
a
lady
s
man
of
the
first
water
in
consequence
of
his
intimacies
among
actresses
she
was
anxious
to
know
him
she
read
his
books
and
was
fired
with
enthusiasm
less
perhaps
for
his
talents
than
for
his
successes
with
women
and
to
attract
him
to
the
country
she
started
the
notion
that
it
was
obligatory
on
sancerre
to
return
one
of
its
great
men
at
the
elections
she
made
gatien
boirouge
write
to
the
great
physician
bianchon
whom
he
claimed
as
a
cousin
through
the
popinots
then
she
persuaded
an
old
friend
of
the
departed
madame
lousteau
to
stir
up
the
journalist
s
ambitions
by
letting
him
know
that
certain
persons
in
sancerre
were
firmly
bent
on
electing
a
deputy
from
among
the
distinguished
men
in
paris
tired
of
her
commonplace
neighbors
madame
de
la
baudraye
would
thus
at
last
meet
really
illustrious
men
and
might
give
her
fall
the
lustre
of
fame
neither
lousteau
nor
bianchon
replied
they
were
waiting
perhaps
till
the
holidays
bianchon
who
had
won
his
professor
s
chair
the
year
before
after
a
brilliant
contest
could
not
leave
his
lectures
in
the
month
of
september
when
the
vintage
was
at
its
height
the
two
parisians
arrived
in
their
native
province
and
found
it
absorbed
in
the
unremitting
toil
of
the
of
there
could
therefore
be
no
public
demonstration
in
their
favor
we
have
fallen
flat
said
lousteau
to
his
companion
in
the
slang
of
the
stage
in
lousteau
worn
by
sixteen
years
of
struggle
in
the
capital
and
aged
quite
as
much
by
pleasure
as
by
penury
hard
work
and
disappointments
looked
though
he
was
no
more
than
he
was
already
bald
and
had
assumed
a
byronic
air
in
harmony
with
his
early
decay
and
the
lines
furrowed
in
his
face
by
in
champagne
he
ascribed
these
of
dissipation
to
the
severities
of
a
literary
life
declaring
that
the
press
was
murderous
and
he
gave
it
to
be
understood
that
it
consumed
superior
talents
so
as
to
lend
a
grace
to
his
exhaustion
in
his
native
town
he
thought
proper
to
exaggerate
his
affected
contempt
of
life
and
his
spurious
misanthropy
still
his
eyes
could
flash
with
fire
like
a
volcano
supposed
to
be
extinct
and
he
endeavored
by
dressing
fashionably
to
make
up
for
the
lack
of
youth
that
might
strike
a
woman
s
eye
horace
bianchon
who
wore
the
ribbon
of
the
legion
of
honor
was
fat
and
burly
as
beseems
a
fashionable
physician
with
a
patriarchal
air
his
hair
thick
and
long
a
prominent
brow
the
frame
of
a
hard
worker
and
the
calm
expression
of
a
philosopher
this
somewhat
prosaic
personality
set
off
his
more
frivolous
companion
to
advantage
the
two
great
men
remained
unrecognized
during
a
whole
morning
at
the
inn
where
they
had
put
up
and
it
was
only
by
chance
that
monsieur
de
clagny
heard
of
their
arrival
madame
de
la
baudraye
in
despair
at
this
despatched
gatien
boirouge
who
had
no
vineyards
to
beg
the
two
gentlemen
to
spend
a
few
days
at
the
chateau
d
anzy
for
the
last
year
dinah
had
played
the
chatelaine
and
spent
the
winter
only
at
la
baudraye
monsieur
gravier
the
public
prosecutor
the
presiding
judge
and
gatien
boirouge
combined
to
give
a
banquet
to
the
great
men
to
meet
the
literary
personages
of
the
town
on
hearing
that
the
beautiful
madame
de
la
baudraye
was
jan
diaz
the
parisians
went
to
spend
three
days
at
anzy
fetched
in
a
sort
of
wagonette
driven
by
gatien
himself
the
young
man
under
a
genuine
illusion
spoke
of
madame
de
la
baudraye
not
only
as
the
handsomest
woman
in
those
parts
a
woman
so
superior
that
she
might
give
george
sand
a
qualm
but
as
a
woman
who
would
produce
a
great
sensation
in
paris
hence
the
extreme
though
suppressed
astonishment
of
doctor
bianchon
and
the
waggish
journalist
when
they
beheld
on
the
garden
steps
of
anzy
a
lady
dressed
in
thin
black
cashmere
with
a
deep
tucker
in
effect
like
a
cut
short
for
they
quite
understood
the
pretentiousness
of
such
extreme
simplicity
dinah
also
wore
a
black
velvet
cap
like
that
in
the
portrait
of
raphael
and
below
it
her
hair
fell
in
thick
curls
this
attire
showed
off
a
rather
pretty
figure
fine
eyes
and
handsome
eyelids
somewhat
faded
by
the
weariful
life
that
has
been
described
in
le
berry
the
singularity
of
this
costume
was
a
cloak
for
the
romantic
affectations
of
the
superior
woman
on
seeing
the
affectations
of
their
too
amiable
hostess
which
were
indeed
affectations
of
soul
and
mind
the
friends
glanced
at
each
other
and
put
on
a
deeply
serious
expression
to
listen
to
madame
de
la
baudraye
who
made
them
a
set
speech
of
thanks
for
coming
to
cheer
the
monotony
of
her
days
dinah
walked
her
guests
round
and
round
the
lawn
ornamented
with
large
vases
of
flowers
which
lay
in
front
of
the
chateau
d
anzy
how
is
it
said
lousteau
the
practical
joker
that
so
handsome
a
woman
as
you
and
apparently
so
superior
should
have
remained
buried
in
the
country
what
do
you
do
to
make
life
endurable
ah
that
is
the
crux
said
the
lady
it
is
unendurable
utter
despair
or
dull
resignation
there
is
no
third
alternative
that
is
the
arid
soil
in
which
our
existence
is
rooted
and
on
which
a
thousand
stagnant
ideas
fall
they
can
not
fertilize
the
ground
but
they
supply
food
for
the
etiolated
flowers
of
our
desert
souls
never
believe
in
indifference
indifference
is
either
despair
or
resignation
then
each
woman
takes
up
the
pursuit
which
according
to
her
character
seems
to
promise
some
amusement
some
rush
into
and
washing
household
management
the
rural
joys
of
the
vintage
or
the
harvest
bottling
fruit
embroidering
handkerchiefs
the
cares
of
motherhood
the
intrigues
of
a
country
town
others
torment
a
piano
which
at
the
end
of
seven
years
sounds
like
an
old
kettle
and
ends
its
asthmatic
life
at
the
chateau
d
anzy
some
pious
dames
talk
over
the
different
brands
of
the
word
of
god
the
abbe
fritaud
as
compared
with
the
abbe
guinard
they
play
cards
in
the
evening
dance
with
the
same
partners
for
twelve
years
running
in
the
same
rooms
at
the
same
dates
this
delightful
life
is
varied
by
solemn
walks
on
the
mall
visits
of
politeness
among
the
women
who
ask
each
other
where
they
bought
their
gowns
conversation
is
bounded
on
the
south
by
remarks
on
the
intrigues
lying
hidden
under
the
stagnant
water
of
provincial
life
on
the
north
by
proposed
marriages
on
the
west
by
jealousies
and
on
the
east
by
sour
remarks
and
so
she
went
on
striking
an
attitude
you
see
a
woman
wrinkled
at
ten
years
before
the
time
fixed
by
the
rules
of
doctor
bianchon
a
woman
whose
skin
is
ruined
at
an
early
age
who
turns
as
yellow
as
a
quince
when
she
is
yellow
at
all
we
have
seen
some
turn
green
when
we
have
reached
that
point
we
try
to
justify
our
normal
condition
then
we
turn
and
rend
the
terrible
passion
of
paris
with
teeth
as
sharp
as
rat
s
teeth
we
have
puritan
women
here
sour
enough
to
tear
the
laces
of
parisian
finery
and
eat
out
all
the
poetry
of
your
parisian
beauties
who
undermine
the
happiness
of
others
while
they
cry
up
their
walnuts
and
rancid
bacon
glorify
this
squalid
and
the
dingy
color
and
conventual
small
of
our
delightful
life
at
i
admire
such
courage
madame
said
bianchon
when
we
have
to
endure
such
misfortunes
it
is
well
to
have
the
wit
to
make
a
virtue
of
amazed
at
the
brilliant
move
by
which
dinah
thus
placed
provincial
life
at
the
mercy
of
her
guests
in
anticipation
of
their
sarcasms
gatien
boirouge
nudged
lousteau
s
elbow
with
a
glance
and
a
smile
which
said
well
did
i
say
too
much
but
madame
said
lousteau
you
are
proving
that
we
are
still
in
paris
i
shall
steal
this
gem
of
description
it
will
be
worth
ten
thousand
francs
to
me
in
an
oh
monsieur
she
retorted
never
trust
provincial
and
why
not
said
lousteau
madame
de
la
baudraye
was
wily
enough
an
innocent
form
of
cunning
to
be
sure
to
show
the
two
parisians
one
of
whom
she
would
choose
to
be
her
conquerer
the
snare
into
which
he
would
fall
reflecting
that
she
would
have
the
upper
hand
at
the
moment
when
he
should
cease
to
see
it
when
you
first
come
said
she
you
laugh
at
us
then
when
you
have
forgotten
the
impression
of
paris
brilliancy
and
see
us
in
our
own
sphere
you
pay
court
to
us
if
only
as
a
pastime
and
you
who
are
famous
for
your
past
passions
will
be
the
object
of
attentions
which
will
flatter
you
then
take
care
cried
dinah
with
a
coquettish
gesture
raising
herself
above
provincial
absurdities
and
lousteau
s
irony
by
her
own
sarcastic
speech
when
a
poor
little
woman
has
an
eccentric
passion
for
some
superior
man
some
parisian
who
has
wandered
into
the
provinces
it
is
to
her
something
more
than
a
sentiment
she
makes
it
her
occupation
and
part
of
all
her
life
there
is
nothing
more
dangerous
than
the
attachment
of
such
a
woman
she
compares
she
studies
she
reflects
she
dreams
and
she
will
not
give
up
her
dream
she
thinks
still
of
the
man
she
loves
when
he
has
ceased
to
think
of
her
now
one
of
the
catastrophes
that
weigh
most
heavily
on
a
woman
in
the
provinces
is
that
abrupt
termination
of
her
passion
which
is
so
often
seen
in
england
in
the
country
a
life
under
minute
observation
as
keen
as
an
indian
s
compels
a
woman
either
to
keep
on
the
rails
or
to
start
aside
like
a
steam
engine
wrecked
by
an
obstacle
the
strategies
of
love
the
coquetting
which
form
half
the
composition
of
a
parisian
woman
are
utterly
unknown
that
is
true
said
lousteau
there
is
in
a
woman
s
heart
a
store
of
surprises
as
in
some
dear
me
dinah
went
on
a
woman
will
have
spoken
to
you
three
times
in
the
course
of
a
winter
and
without
your
knowing
it
you
will
be
lodged
in
her
heart
then
comes
a
picnic
an
excursion
what
not
and
all
is
said
or
if
you
prefer
it
all
is
done
this
conduct
which
seems
odd
to
unobserving
persons
is
really
very
natural
a
poet
such
as
you
are
or
a
philosopher
an
observer
like
doctor
bianchon
instead
of
vilifying
the
provincial
woman
and
believing
her
depraved
would
be
able
to
guess
the
wonderful
unrevealed
poetry
every
chapter
in
short
of
the
sweet
romance
of
which
the
last
phrase
falls
to
the
benefit
of
some
happy
or
some
provincial
the
provincial
women
i
have
met
in
paris
said
lousteau
were
in
fact
rapid
in
their
proceedings
my
word
they
are
strange
said
the
lady
giving
a
significant
shrug
of
her
shoulders
they
are
like
the
playgoers
who
book
for
the
second
performance
feeling
sure
that
the
piece
will
not
fail
replied
the
journalist
and
what
is
the
cause
of
all
these
woes
asked
bianchon
paris
is
the
monster
that
brings
us
grief
replied
the
superior
woman
the
evil
is
seven
leagues
round
and
devastates
the
whole
land
provincial
life
is
not
it
is
only
when
a
nation
is
divided
into
fifty
minor
states
that
each
can
have
a
physiognomy
of
its
own
and
then
a
woman
reflects
the
glory
of
the
sphere
where
she
reigns
this
social
phenomenon
i
am
told
may
be
seen
in
italy
switzerland
and
germany
but
in
france
as
in
every
country
where
there
is
but
one
capital
a
dead
level
of
manners
must
necessarily
result
from
then
you
would
say
that
manners
could
only
recover
their
individuality
and
native
distinction
by
the
formation
of
a
federation
of
french
states
into
one
empire
said
lousteau
that
is
hardly
to
be
wished
for
france
would
have
to
conquer
too
many
countries
said
bianchon
this
misfortune
is
unknown
in
england
exclaimed
dinah
london
does
not
exert
such
tyranny
as
that
by
which
paris
oppresses
france
for
which
indeed
french
ingenuity
will
at
last
find
a
remedy
however
it
has
a
worse
disease
in
its
vile
hypocrisy
which
is
a
far
greater
evil
the
english
aristocracy
said
lousteau
hastening
to
put
a
word
in
for
he
foresaw
a
byronic
paragraph
has
the
advantage
over
ours
of
assimilating
every
form
of
superiority
it
lives
in
the
midst
of
magnificent
parks
it
is
in
london
for
no
more
than
two
months
it
lives
in
the
country
flourishing
there
and
making
it
yes
said
madame
de
la
baudraye
london
is
the
capital
of
trade
and
speculation
and
the
centre
of

the
aristocracy
hold
a
mote
there
for
sixty
days
only
it
gives
and
takes
the
passwords
of
the
day

in
on
the
legislative
cookery
reviews
the
girls
to
marry
the
carriages
to
be
sold
exchanges
greetings
and
is
away
again
and
is
so
far
from
amusing
that
it
can
not
bear
itself
for
more
than
the
few
days
known
as
the
hence
said
lousteau
hoping
to
stop
this
nimble
tongue
by
an
epigram
in
perfidious
albion
as
the
has
it
you
may
happen
to
meet
a
charming
woman
in
any
part
of
the
but
charming
women
replied
madame
de
la
baudraye
with
a
smile
here
is
my
mother
i
will
introduce
you
said
she
seeing
madame
piedefer
coming
towards
them
having
introduced
the
two
paris
lions
to
the
ambitious
skeleton
that
called
itself
woman
under
the
name
of
madame
piedefer
a
tall
lean
personage
with
a
red
face
teeth
that
were
doubtfully
genuine
and
hair
that
was
undoubtedly
dyed
dinah
left
her
visitors
to
themselves
for
a
few
minutes
well
said
gatien
to
lousteau
what
do
you
think
of
her
i
think
that
the
clever
woman
of
sancerre
is
simply
the
greatest
chatterbox
replied
the
journalist
a
woman
who
wants
to
see
you
deputy
cried
gatien
an
angel
forgive
me
i
forgot
you
were
in
love
with
her
said
lousteau
forgive
the
cynicism
of
an
old
ask
bianchon
i
have
no
illusions
left
i
see
things
as
they
are
the
woman
has
evidently
dried
up
her
mother
like
a
partridge
left
to
roast
at
too
fierce
a
gatien
de
boirouge
contrived
to
let
madame
de
la
baudraye
know
what
the
journalist
had
said
of
her
in
the
course
of
the
dinner
which
was
copious
not
to
say
splendid
and
the
lady
took
care
not
to
talk
too
much
while
it
was
proceeding
this
lack
of
conversation
betrayed
gatien
s
indiscretion
etienne
tried
to
regain
his
footing
but
all
dinah
s
advances
were
directed
to
bianchon
however
through
the
evening
the
baroness
was
gracious
to
lousteau
again
have
you
never
observed
what
great
meanness
may
be
committed
for
small
ends
thus
the
haughty
dinah
who
would
not
sacrifice
herself
for
a
fool
who
in
the
depths
of
the
country
led
such
a
wretched
life
of
struggles
of
suppressed
rebellion
of
unuttered
poetry
who
to
get
away
from
lousteau
had
climbed
the
highest
and
steepest
peak
of
her
scorn
and
who
would
not
have
come
down
if
she
had
seen
the
sham
byron
at
her
feet
suddenly
stepped
off
it
as
she
recollected
her
album
madame
de
la
baudraye
had
caught
the
mania
for
autographs
she
possessed
an
oblong
volume
which
deserved
the
name
of
album
better
than
most
as
of
the
pages
were
still
blank
the
baronne
de
fontaine
who
had
kept
it
for
three
months
had
with
great
difficulty
obtained
a
line
from
rossini
six
bars
written
by
meyerbeer
the
four
lines
that
victor
hugo
writes
in
every
album
a
verse
from
lamartine
a
few
words
from
beranger
ne
pouvait
se
consoler
du
depart
d
the
first
words
of
written
by
george
sand
scribe
s
famous
lines
on
the
umbrella
a
sentence
from
charles
nodier
an
outline
of
distance
by
jules
dupre
the
signature
of
david
d
angers
and
three
notes
written
by
hector
berlioz
monsieur
de
clagny
during
a
visit
to
paris
added
a
song
by
lacenaire
a
much
coveted
autograph
two
lines
from
fieschi
and
an
extremely
short
note
from
napoleon
which
were
pasted
on
to
pages
of
the
album
then
monsieur
gravier
in
the
course
of
a
tour
had
persuaded
mademoiselle
mars
to
write
her
name
on
this
album
with
mademoiselles
georges
taglioni
and
grisi
and
some
distinguished
actors
such
as
frederick
lemaitre
monrose
bouffe
rubini
lablache
nourrit
and
arnal
for
he
knew
a
set
of
old
fellows
brought
up
in
the
seraglio
as
they
phrased
it
who
did
him
this
favor
this
beginning
of
a
collection
was
all
the
more
precious
to
dinah
because
she
was
the
only
person
for
ten
leagues
round
who
owned
an
album
within
the
last
two
years
however
several
young
ladies
had
acquired
such
books
in
which
they
made
their
friends
and
acquaintances
write
more
or
less
absurd
quotations
or
sentiments
you
who
spend
your
lives
in
collecting
autographs
simple
and
happy
souls
like
dutch
tulip
fanciers
you
will
excuse
dinah
when
in
her
fear
of
not
keeping
her
guests
more
than
two
days
she
begged
bianchon
to
enrich
the
volume
she
handed
to
him
with
a
few
lines
of
his
writing
the
doctor
made
lousteau
smile
by
showing
him
this
sentence
on
the
first
page
what
makes
the
populace
dangerous
is
that
it
has
in
its
pocket
an
absolution
for
every
crime
j
b
de
we
will
second
the
man
who
is
brave
enough
to
plead
in
favor
of
the
monarchy
desplein
s
great
pupil
whispered
to
lousteau
and
he
wrote
below
the
distinction
between
napoleon
and
a
is
evident
only
to
society
nature
takes
no
account
of
it
thus
democracy
which
resists
inequality
constantly
appeals
to
nature
ah
cried
dinah
amazed
you
rich
men
take
a
gold
piece
out
of
your
purse
as
poor
men
bring
out
a
farthing
i
do
not
know
she
went
on
turning
to
lousteau
whether
it
is
taking
an
unfair
advantage
of
a
guest
to
hope
for
a
few
lines
nay
madame
you
flatter
me
bianchon
is
a
great
man
but
i
am
too
insignificant
twenty
years
hence
my
name
will
be
more
difficult
to
identify
than
that
of
the
public
prosecutor
whose
axiom
written
in
your
album
will
designate
him
as
an
obscurer
montesquieu
and
i
should
want
at
least
hours
to
improvise
some
sufficiently
bitter
reflections
for
i
could
only
describe
what
i
i
wish
you
needed
a
fortnight
said
madame
de
la
baudraye
graciously
as
she
handed
him
the
book
i
should
keep
you
here
all
the
at
five
next
morning
all
the
party
in
the
chateau
d
anzy
were
astir
little
la
baudraye
having
arranged
a
day
s
sport
for
the
parisians
less
for
their
pleasure
than
to
gratify
his
own
conceit
he
was
delighted
to
make
them
walk
over
the
twelve
hundred
acres
of
waste
land
that
he
was
intending
to
reclaim
an
undertaking
that
would
cost
some
hundred
thousand
francs
but
which
might
yield
an
increase
of
thirty
to
sixty
thousand
francs
a
year
in
the
returns
of
the
estate
of
anzy
do
you
know
why
the
public
prosecutor
has
not
come
out
with
us
asked
gatien
boirouge
of
monsieur
gravier
why
he
told
us
that
he
was
obliged
to
sit
the
minor
cases
are
before
the
court
replied
the
other
and
did
you
believe
that
cried
gatien
well
my
papa
said
to
me
monsieur
lebas
will
not
join
you
early
for
monsieur
de
clagny
has
begged
him
as
his
deputy
to
sit
for
him
indeed
said
gravier
changing
countenance
and
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
is
gone
to
la
charite
but
why
do
you
meddle
in
such
matters
said
bianchon
to
gatien
horace
is
right
said
lousteau
i
can
not
imagine
why
you
trouble
your
heads
so
much
about
each
other
you
waste
your
time
in
horace
bianchon
looked
at
etienne
lousteau
as
much
as
to
say
that
newspaper
epigrams
and
the
satire
of
the
funny
column
were
incomprehensible
at
sancerre
on
reaching
a
copse
monsieur
gravier
left
the
two
great
men
and
gatien
under
the
guidance
of
a
keeper
to
make
their
way
through
a
little
ravine
well
we
must
wait
for
monsieur
gravier
said
bianchon
when
they
had
reached
a
clearing
you
may
be
a
great
physician
said
gatien
but
you
are
ignorant
of
provincial
life
you
mean
to
wait
for
monsieur
gravier
by
this
time
he
is
running
like
a
hare
in
spite
of
his
little
round
stomach
he
is
within
twenty
minutes
of
anzy
by
now
gatien
looked
at
his
watch
good
he
will
be
just
in
where
at
the
chateau
for
breakfast
replied
gatien
do
you
suppose
i
could
rest
easy
if
madame
de
la
baudraye
were
alone
with
monsieur
de
clagny
there
are
two
of
them
now
they
will
keep
an
eye
on
each
other
dinah
will
be
well
ah
ha
then
madame
de
la
baudraye
has
not
yet
made
up
her
mind
said
lousteau
so
mamma
thinks
for
my
part
i
am
afraid
that
monsieur
de
clagny
has
at
last
succeeded
in
bewitching
madame
de
la
baudraye
if
he
has
been
able
to
show
her
that
he
had
any
chance
of
putting
on
the
robes
of
the
keeper
of
the
seals
he
may
have
hidden
his
moleskin
complexion
his
terrible
eyes
his
touzled
mane
his
voice
like
a
hoarse
crier
s
his
bony
figure
like
that
of
a
starveling
poet
and
have
assumed
all
the
charms
of
adonis
if
dinah
sees
monsieur
de
clagny
as
she
may
see
him
as
a
handsome
youth
eloquence
has
great
besides
madame
de
la
baudraye
is
full
of
ambition
she
does
not
like
sancerre
and
dreams
of
the
glories
of
but
what
interest
have
you
in
all
this
said
lousteau
if
she
is
in
love
with
the
public
prosecutor
ah
you
think
she
will
not
love
him
for
long
and
you
hope
to
succeed
you
who
live
in
paris
said
gatien
meet
as
many
different
women
as
there
are
days
in
the
year
but
at
sancerre
where
there
are
not
half
a
dozen
and
where
of
those
six
five
set
up
for
the
most
extravagant
virtue
when
the
handsomest
of
them
all
keeps
you
at
an
infinite
distance
by
looks
as
scornful
as
though
she
were
of
the
blood
royal
a
young
man
of
may
surely
be
allowed
to
make
a
guess
at
her
secrets
since
she
must
then
treat
him
with
some
consideration
so
that
is
what
you
call
it
in
these
parts
said
the
journalist
with
a
smile
i
should
suppose
madame
de
la
baudraye
to
have
too
much
good
taste
to
trouble
her
head
about
that
ugly
ape
said
bianchon
horace
said
lousteau
look
here
o
learned
interpreter
of
human
nature
let
us
lay
a
trap
for
the
public
prosecutor
we
shall
be
doing
our
friend
gatien
a
service
and
get
a
laugh
out
of
it
i
do
not
love
public
you
have
a
keen
intuition
of
destiny
said
horace
but
what
can
we
do
well
after
dinner
we
will
tell
sundry
little
anecdotes
of
wives
caught
out
by
their
husbands
killed
murdered
under
the
most
terrible
then
we
shall
see
the
faces
that
madame
de
la
baudraye
and
de
clagny
will
not
amiss
said
bianchon
one
or
the
other
must
surely
by
look
or
gesture
i
know
a
newspaper
editor
lousteau
went
on
addressing
gatien
who
anxious
to
forefend
a
grievous
fate
will
take
no
stories
but
such
as
tell
the
tale
of
lovers
burned
hewn
pounded
or
cut
to
pieces
of
wives
boiled
fried
or
baked
he
takes
them
to
his
wife
to
read
hoping
that
sheer
fear
will
keep
her
faithful
satisfied
with
that
humble
alternative
poor
man
you
see
my
dear
to
what
the
smallest
error
may
lead
you
says
he
epitomizing
arnolfe
s
address
to
madame
de
la
baudraye
is
quite
guiltless
this
youth
sees
double
said
bianchon
madame
piedefer
seems
to
me
far
too
pious
to
invite
her
daughter
s
lover
to
the
chateau
d
anzy
madame
de
la
baudraye
would
have
to
hoodwink
her
mother
her
husband
her
maid
and
her
mother
s
maid
that
is
too
much
to
do
i
acquit
well
with
more
reason
because
her
husband
never
quits
her
said
gatien
laughing
at
his
own
wit
we
can
easily
remember
two
or
three
stories
that
will
make
dinah
quake
said
lousteau
young
man
and
you
too
bianchon
let
me
beg
you
to
maintain
a
stern
demeanor
be
thorough
diplomatists
an
easy
manner
without
exaggeration
and
watch
the
faces
of
the
two
criminals
you
know
without
seeming
to
do
so
out
of
the
corner
of
your
eye
or
in
a
glass
on
the
sly
this
morning
we
will
hunt
the
hare
this
evening
we
will
hunt
the
public
the
evening
began
with
a
triumph
for
lousteau
who
returned
the
album
to
the
lady
with
this
elegy
written
in
it
spleen
you
ask
for
verse
from
me
the
feeble
prey
of
this
world
a
waif
and
stray
with
none
to
whom
to
cling
from
me
unhappy
purblind
hopeless
devil
who
e
en
in
what
is
good
see
only
evil
in
any
earthly
thing
this
page
the
pastime
of
a
dame
so
fair
may
not
reflect
the
shadow
of
my
care
for
all
things
have
their
place
of
love
to
ladies
bright
the
poet
sings
of
joy
and
balls
and
dress
and
dainty
things
nay
or
of
god
and
grace
it
were
a
bitter
jest
to
bid
the
pen
of
one
so
worn
with
life
so
hating
men
depict
a
scene
of
joy
would
you
exult
in
sight
to
one
born
blind
or
cruel
of
a
mother
s
love
remind
some
hapless
orphan
boy
when
cold
despair
has
gripped
a
heart
still
fond
when
there
is
no
young
heart
that
will
respond
to
it
in
love
the

is
a
lie
if
there
is
none
to
weep

soon
must

give
me
your
pity
often
i
blaspheme
the
sacred
name
of
god
does
it
not
seem
that
i
was
born
in
vain
why
should
i
bless
him
or
why
thank
him

he
might
have
made
me

i
am

etienne
lousteau
september
chateau
d
anzy
and
you
have
written
those
verses
since
yesterday
cried
clagny
in
a
suspicious
tone
dear
me
yes
as
i
was
following
the
game
it
is
only
too
evident
i
would
gladly
have
done
something
better
for
the
verses
are
exquisite
cried
dinah
casting
up
her
eyes
to
heaven
they
are
alas
the
expression
of
a
too
genuine
feeling
replied
lousteau
in
a
tone
of
deep
dejection
the
reader
will
of
course
have
guessed
that
the
journalist
had
stored
these
lines
in
his
memory
for
ten
years
at
least
for
he
had
written
them
at
the
time
of
the
restoration
in
disgust
at
being
unable
to
get
on
madame
de
la
baudraye
gazed
at
him
with
such
pity
as
the
woes
of
genius
inspire
and
monsieur
de
clagny
who
caught
her
expression
turned
in
hatred
against
this
sham
the
name
of
an
elegy
written
by
millevoye
he
sat
down
to
backgammon
with
the
cure
of
sancerre
the
presiding
judge
s
son
was
so
extremely
obliging
as
to
place
a
lamp
near
the
two
players
in
such
a
way
as
that
the
light
fell
full
on
madame
de
la
baudraye
who
took
up
her
work
she
was
embroidering
in
coarse
wool
a
the
three
conspirators
sat
close
at
hand
for
whom
are
you
decorating
that
pretty
basket
madame
said
lousteau
for
some
charity
lottery
perhaps
no
she
said
i
think
there
is
too
much
display
in
charity
done
to
the
sound
of
a
you
are
very
indiscreet
said
monsieur
gravier
can
there
be
any
indiscretion
said
lousteau
in
inquiring
who
the
happy
mortal
may
be
in
whose
room
that
basket
is
to
stand
there
is
no
happy
mortal
in
the
case
said
dinah
it
is
for
monsieur
de
la
the
public
prosecutor
looked
slily
at
madame
de
la
baudraye
and
her
work
as
if
he
had
said
to
himself
i
have
lost
my
why
madame
may
we
not
think
him
happy
in
having
a
lovely
wife
happy
in
her
decorating
his
so
charmingly
the
colors
are
red
and
black
like
robin
goodfellow
if
ever
i
marry
i
only
hope
that
twelve
years
after
my
wife
s
embroidered
baskets
may
still
be
for
and
why
should
they
not
be
for
you
said
the
lady
fixing
her
fine
gray
eyes
full
of
invitation
on
etienne
s
face
parisians
believe
in
nothing
said
the
lawyer
bitterly
the
virtue
of
women
is
doubted
above
all
things
with
terrible
insolence
yes
for
some
time
past
the
books
you
have
written
you
paris
authors
your
farces
your
dramas
all
your
atrocious
literature
turn
on
adultery
come
come
monsieur
the
public
prosecutor
retorted
etienne
laughing
i
left
you
to
play
your
game
in
peace
i
did
not
attack
you
and
here
you
are
bringing
an
indictment
against
me
on
my
honor
as
a
journalist
i
have
launched
above
a
hundred
articles
against
the
writers
you
speak
of
but
i
confess
that
in
attacking
them
it
was
to
attempt
something
like
criticism
be
just
if
you
condemn
them
you
must
condemn
homer
whose
turns
on
helen
of
troy
you
must
condemn
milton
s
eve
and
her
serpent
seem
to
me
a
pretty
little
case
of
symbolical
adultery
you
must
suppress
the
psalms
of
david
inspired
by
the
highly
adulterous
love
affairs
of
that
louis
xiv
of
judah
you
must
make
a
bonfire
of
le
tartuffe
l
ecole
des

phedre

le

de

s
petrarch
s

all

the
history
of
france
and
of
rome
etc
excepting
bossuet
s
des
and
pascal
s
i
do
not
think
there
are
many
books
left
to
read
if
you
insist
on
eliminating
all
those
in
which
illicit
love
is
much
loss
that
would
be
said
monsieur
de
clagny
etienne
nettled
by
the
superior
air
assumed
by
monsieur
de
clagny
wanted
to
infuriate
him
by
one
of
those
jests
which
consist
in
defending
an
opinion
in
which
we
have
no
belief
simply
to
rouse
the
wrath
of
a
poor
man
who
argues
in
good
faith
a
regular
journalist
s
pleasantry
if
we
take
up
the
political
attitude
into
which
you
would
force
yourself
he
went
on
without
heeding
the
lawyer
s
remark
and
assume
the
part
of
public
prosecutor
of
all
the
ages
for
every
government
has
its
public
ministry
well
the
catholic
religion
is
infected
at
its
by
a
startling
instance
of
illegal
union
in
the
opinion
of
king
herod
and
of
pilate
as
representing
the
roman
empire
joseph
s
wife
figured
as
an
adulteress
since
by
her
avowal
joseph
was
not
the
father
of
jesus
the
heathen
judge
could
no
more
recognize
the
immaculate
conception
than
you
yourself
would
admit
the
possibility
of
such
a
miracle
if
a
new
religion
should
nowadays
be
preached
as
based
on
a
similar
mystery
do
you
suppose
that
a
judge
and
jury
in
a
police
court
would
give
credence
to
the
operation
of
the
holy
ghost
and
yet
who
can
venture
to
assert
that
god
will
never
again
redeem
mankind
is
it
any
better
now
than
it
was
under
tiberius
your
argument
is
blasphemy
said
monsieur
de
clagny
i
grant
it
said
the
journalist
but
not
with
malicious
intent
you
can
not
suppress
historical
fact
in
my
opinion
pilate
when
he
sentenced
jesus
and
anytus
who
spoke
for
the
aristocratic
party
at
athens
when
he
insisted
on
the
death
of
socrates
both
represented
established
social
interests
which
held
themselves
legitimate
invested
with
powers
and
obliged
to
defend
themselves
pilate
and
anytus
in
their
time
were
not
less
logical
than
the
public
prosecutors
who
demanded
the
heads
of
the
sergeants
of
la
rochelle
who
at
this
day
are
guillotining
the
republicans
who
take
up
arms
against
the
throne
as
established
by
the
revolution
of
july
and
the
innovators
who
aim
at
upsetting
society
for
their
own
advantage
under
pretence
of
organizing
it
on
a
better
footing
in
the
eyes
of
the
great
families
of
greece
and
rome
socrates
and
jesus
were
criminals
to
those
ancient
aristocracies
their
opinions
were
akin
to
those
of
the
mountain
and
if
their
followers
had
been
victorious
they
would
have
produced
a
little
in
the
roman
empire
or
in
what
are
you
trying
to
come
to
monsieur
asked
the
lawyer
to
adultery
for
thus
monsieur
a
buddhist
as
he
smokes
his
pipe
may
very
well
assert
that
the
christian
religion
is
founded
in
adultery
as
we
believe
that
mahomet
is
an
impostor
that
his
koran
is
an
epitome
of
the
old
testament
and
the
gospels
and
that
god
never
had
the
least
intention
of
constituting
that
his
if
there
were
many
men
like
you
in
france
and
there
are
more
than
enough
unfortunately
all
government
would
be
and
there
would
be
no
religion
at
all
said
madame
piedefer
who
had
been
making
strangely
wry
faces
all
through
this
discussion
you
are
paining
them
very
much
said
bianchon
to
lousteau
in
an
undertone
do
not
talk
of
religion
you
are
saying
things
that
are
enough
to
upset
if
i
were
a
writer
or
a
romancer
said
monsieur
gravier
i
should
take
the
side
of
the
luckless
husbands
i
who
have
seen
many
things
and
strange
things
too
know
that
among
the
ranks
of
deceived
husbands
there
are
some
whose
attitude
is
not
devoid
of
energy
men
who
at
a
crisis
can
be
very
dramatic
to
use
one
of
your
words
monsieur
he
said
addressing
etienne
you
are
very
right
my
dear
monsieur
gravier
said
lousteau
i
never
thought
that
deceived
husbands
were
ridiculous
on
the
contrary
i
think
highly
of
them
do
you
not
think
a
husband
s
confidence
a
sublime
thing
said
bianchon
he
believes
in
his
wife
he
does
not
suspect
her
he
trusts
her
implicitly
but
if
he
is
so
weak
as
to
trust
her
you
make
game
of
him
if
he
is
jealous
and
suspicious
you
hate
him
what
then
i
ask
you
is
the
happy
medium
for
a
man
of
spirit
if
monsieur
de
clagny
had
not
just
expressed
such
vehement
disapproval
of
the
immorality
of
stories
in
which
the
matrimonial
compact
is
violated
i
could
tell
you
of
a
husband
s
revenge
said
lousteau
monsieur
de
clagny
threw
the
dice
with
a
convulsive
jerk
and
dared
not
look
up
at
the
journalist
a
story
from
you
cried
madame
de
la
baudraye
i
should
hardly
have
dared
to
hope
for
such
a
treat
it
is
not
my
story
madame
i
am
not
clever
enough
to
invent
such
a
tragedy
it
was
told
me
and
how
delightfully
by
one
of
our
greatest
writers
the
finest
literary
musician
of
our
day
charles
well
tell
it
said
dinah
i
never
met
monsieur
nodier
so
you
have
no
comparison
to
not
long
after
the
brumaire
etienne
began
there
was
as
you
know
a
call
to
arms
in
brittany
and
la
vendee
the
first
consul
anxious
before
all
things
for
peace
in
france
opened
negotiations
with
the
rebel
chiefs
and
took
energetic
military
measures
but
while
combining
his
plans
of
campaign
with
the
insinuating
charm
of
italian
diplomacy
he
also
set
the
machiavelian
springs
of
the
police
in
movement
fouche
then
being
at
its
head
and
none
of
these
means
were
superfluous
to
stifle
the
fire
of
war
then
blaring
in
the
west
at
this
time
a
young
man
of
the
maille
family
was
despatched
by
the
chouans
from
brittany
to
saumur
to
open
communications
between
certain
magnates
of
that
town
and
its
environs
and
the
leaders
of
the
royalist
party
the
envoy
was
in
fact
arrested
on
the
very
day
he
landed
for
he
traveled
by
boat
disguised
as
a
master
mariner
however
as
a
man
of
practical
intelligence
he
had
calculated
all
the
risks
of
the
undertaking
his
passport
and
papers
were
all
in
order
and
the
men
told
off
to
take
him
were
afraid
of
blundering
the
chevalier
de
beauvoir
i
now
remember
his
name
had
studied
his
part
well
he
appealed
to
the
family
whose
name
he
had
borrowed
persisted
in
his
false
address
and
stood
his
examination
so
boldly
that
he
would
have
been
set
at
large
but
for
the
blind
belief
that
the
spies
had
in
their
instructions
which
were
unfortunately
only
too
minute
in
this
dilemma
the
authorities
were
more
ready
to
risk
an
arbitrary
act
than
to
let
a
man
escape
to
whose
capture
the
minister
attached
great
importance
in
those
days
of
liberty
the
agents
of
the
powers
in
authority
cared
little
enough
for
what
we
now
regard
as
the
chevalier
was
therefore
imprisoned
provisionally
until
the
superior
officials
should
come
to
some
decision
as
to
his
identity
he
had
not
long
to
wait
for
it
orders
were
given
to
guard
the
prisoner
closely
in
spite
of
his
denials
the
chevalier
de
beauvoir
was
next
transferred
in
obedience
to
further
orders
to
the
castle
of
l
escarpe
a
name
which
sufficiently
indicates
its
situation
this
fortress
perched
on
very
high
rocks
has
precipices
for
its
trenches
it
is
reached
on
all
sides
by
steep
and
dangerous
paths
and
like
every
ancient
castle
its
principal
gate
has
a
drawbridge
over
a
wide
moat
the
commandant
of
this
prison
delighted
to
have
charge
of
a
man
of
family
whose
manners
were
most
agreeable
who
expressed
himself
well
and
seemed
highly
educated
received
the
chevalier
as
a
godsend
he
offered
him
the
freedom
of
the
place
on
parole
that
they
might
together
the
better
defy
its
dulness
the
prisoner
was
more
than
content
beauvoir
was
a
loyal
gentleman
but
unfortunately
he
was
also
a
very
handsome
youth
he
had
attractive
features
a
dashing
air
a
pleasing
address
and
extraordinary
strength
well
made
active
full
of
enterprise
and
loving
danger
he
would
have
made
an
admirable
leader
of
guerillas
and
was
the
very
man
for
the
part
the
commandant
gave
his
prisoner
the
most
comfortable
room
entertained
him
at
his
table
and
at
first
had
nothing
but
praise
for
the
vendean
this
officer
was
a
corsican
and
married
his
wife
was
pretty
and
charming
and
he
thought
her
perhaps
not
to
be
trusted
at
any
rate
he
was
as
jealous
as
a
corsican
and
a
rather
soldier
may
be
the
lady
took
a
fancy
to
beauvoir
and
he
found
her
very
much
to
his
taste
perhaps
they
loved
love
in
a
prison
is
quick
work
did
they
commit
some
imprudence
was
the
sentiment
they
entertained
something
warmer
than
the
superficial
gallantry
which
is
almost
a
duty
of
men
towards
women
beauvoir
never
fully
explained
this
rather
obscure
episode
of
the
story
it
is
at
least
certain
that
the
commandant
thought
himself
justified
in
treating
his
prisoner
with
excessive
severity
beauvoir
was
placed
in
the
dungeon
fed
on
black
bread
and
cold
water
and
fettered
in
accordance
with
the
traditions
of
the
treatment
lavished
on
captives
his
cell
under
the
was
vaulted
with
hard
stone
the
walls
were
of
desperate
thickness
the
tower
overlooked
the
precipice
when
the
luckless
man
had
convinced
himself
of
the
impossibility
of
escape
he
fell
into
those
which
are
at
once
the
comfort
and
the
crowning
despair
of
prisoners
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
trifles
which
in
such
cases
seem
so
important
he
counted
the
hours
and
the
days
he
studied
the
melancholy
trade
of
being
prisoner
he
became
absorbed
in
himself
and
learned
the
value
of
air
and
sunshine
then
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
he
was
attacked
by
that
terrible
malady
that
fever
for
liberty
which
drives
prisoners
to
those
heroic
efforts
of
which
the
prodigious
achievements
seem
to
us
impossible
though
true
and
which
my
friend
the
doctor
and
he
turned
to
bianchon
would
perhaps
ascribe
to
some
unknown
forces
too
recondite
for
his
physiological
analysis
to
detect
some
mysteries
of
the
human
will
of
which
the
obscurity
baffles
bianchon
shook
his
head
in
negation
beauvoir
was
eating
his
heart
out
for
death
alone
could
set
him
free
one
morning
the
turnkey
whose
duty
it
was
to
bring
him
his
food
instead
of
leaving
him
when
he
had
given
him
his
meagre
pittance
stood
with
his
arms
folded
looking
at
him
with
strange
meaning
conversation
between
them
was
brief
and
the
warder
never
began
it
the
chevalier
was
therefore
greatly
surprised
when
the
man
said
to
him
of
course
monsieur
you
know
your
own
business
when
you
insist
on
being
always
called
monsieur
lebrun
or
citizen
lebrun
it
is
no
concern
of
mine
ascertaining
your
name
is
no
part
of
my
duty
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
whether
you
call
yourself
peter
or
paul
if
every
man
minds
his
own
business
the
cows
will
not
stray
at
the
same
time
know
said
he
with
a
wink
that
you
are
monsieur
chevalier
de
beauvoir
and
cousin
to
madame
la
duchesse
de
heh
he
added
after
a
short
silence
during
which
he
looked
at
his
prisoner
beauvoir
seeing
that
he
was
safe
under
lock
and
key
did
not
imagine
that
his
position
could
be
any
the
worse
if
his
real
name
were
known
well
and
supposing
i
were
the
chevalier
de
beauvoir
what
should
i
gain
by
that
said
he
oh
there
is
everything
to
be
gained
by
it
replied
the
jailer
in
an
undertone
i
have
been
paid
to
help
you
to
get
away
but
wait
a
minute
if
i
were
suspected
in
the
smallest
degree
i
should
be
shot
out
of
hand
so
i
have
said
that
i
will
do
no
more
in
the
matter
than
will
just
earn
the
look
here
said
he
taking
a
small
file
out
of
his
pocket
this
is
your
key
with
this
you
can
cut
through
one
of
your
bars
by
the
mass
but
it
will
not
be
any
easy
job
he
went
on
glancing
at
the
narrow
loophole
that
let
daylight
into
the
dungeon
it
was
in
a
splayed
recess
under
the
deep
cornice
that
ran
round
the
top
of
the
tower
between
the
brackets
that
supported
the
embrasures
monsieur
said
the
man
you
must
take
care
to
saw
through
the
iron
low
enough
to
get
your
body
i
will
get
through
never
fear
said
the
prisoner
but
high
enough
to
leave
a
stanchion
to
fasten
a
cord
to
the
warder
went
on
and
where
is
the
cord
asked
beauvoir
here
said
the
man
throwing
down
a
knotted
rope
it
is
made
of
raveled
linen
that
you
may
be
supposed
to
have
contrived
it
yourself
and
it
is
long
enough
when
you
have
got
to
the
bottom
knot
let
yourself
drop
gently
and
the
rest
you
must
manage
for
yourself
you
will
probably
find
a
carriage
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
and
friends
looking
out
for
you
but
i
know
nothing
about
i
need
not
remind
you
that
there
is
a
to
the
right
of
the
tower
you
will
take
care
of
course
to
choose
a
dark
night
and
wait
till
the
sentinel
is
asleep
you
must
take
your
chance
of
being
shot
but
all
right
all
right
at
least
i
shall
not
rot
here
cried
the
young
man
well
that
may
happen
nevertheless
replied
the
jailer
with
a
stupid
expression
beauvoir
thought
this
was
merely
one
of
the
aimless
remarks
that
such
folks
indulge
in
the
hope
of
freedom
filled
him
with
such
joy
that
he
could
not
be
troubled
to
consider
the
words
of
a
man
who
was
no
more
than
a
better
sort
of
peasant
he
set
to
work
at
once
and
had
filed
the
bars
through
in
the
course
of
the
day
fearing
a
visit
from
the
governor
he
stopped
up
the
breaches
with
bread
crumb
rubbed
in
rust
to
make
it
look
like
iron
he
hid
his
rope
and
waited
for
a
favorable
night
with
the
intensity
of
anticipation
the
deep
anguish
of
soul
that
makes
a
prisoner
s
life
dramatic
at
last
one
murky
night
an
autumn
night
he
finished
cutting
through
the
bars
tied
the
cord
firmly
to
the
stump
and
perched
himself
on
the
sill
outside
holding
on
by
one
hand
to
the
piece
of
iron
remaining
then
he
waited
for
the
darkest
hour
of
the
night
when
the
sentinels
would
probably
be
asleep
this
would
be
not
long
before
dawn
he
knew
the
hours
of
their
rounds
the
length
of
each
watch
every
detail
with
which
prisoners
almost
involuntarily
become
familiar
he
waited
till
the
moment
when
one
of
the
had
spent
of
his
watch
and
gone
into
his
box
for
shelter
from
the
fog
then
feeling
sure
that
the
chances
were
at
the
best
for
his
escape
he
let
himself
down
knot
by
knot
hanging
between
earth
and
sky
and
clinging
to
his
rope
with
the
strength
of
a
giant
all
was
well
at
the
last
knot
but
one
just
as
he
was
about
to
let
himself
drop
a
prudent
impulse
led
him
to
feel
for
the
ground
with
his
feet
and
he
found
no
footing
the
predicament
was
awkward
for
a
man
bathed
in
sweat
tired
and
perplexed
and
in
a
position
where
his
life
was
at
stake
on
even
chances
he
was
about
to
risk
it
when
a
trivial
incident
stopped
him
his
hat
fell
off
happily
he
listened
for
the
noise
it
must
make
in
striking
the
ground
and
he
heard
not
a
sound
the
prisoner
felt
vaguely
suspicious
as
to
this
state
of
affairs
he
began
to
wonder
whether
the
commandant
had
not
laid
a
trap
for
him
but
if
so
why
torn
by
doubts
he
almost
resolved
to
postpone
the
attempt
till
another
night
at
any
rate
he
would
wait
for
the
first
gleam
of
day
when
it
would
still
not
be
impossible
to
escape
his
great
strength
enabled
him
to
climb
up
again
to
his
window
still
he
was
almost
exhausted
by
the
time
he
gained
the
sill
where
he
crouched
on
the
lookout
exactly
like
a
cat
on
the
parapet
of
a
gutter
before
long
by
the
pale
light
of
dawn
he
perceived
as
he
waved
the
rope
that
there
was
a
little
interval
of
a
hundred
feet
between
the
lowest
knot
and
the
pointed
rocks
below
thank
you
my
friend
the
governor
said
he
with
characteristic
coolness
then
after
a
brief
meditation
on
this
revenge
he
thought
it
wise
to
return
to
his
cell
he
laid
his
outer
clothes
conspicuously
on
the
bed
left
the
rope
outside
to
make
it
seem
that
he
had
fallen
and
hid
himself
behind
the
door
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
treacherous
turnkey
arming
himself
with
one
of
the
iron
bars
he
had
filed
out
the
jailer
who
returned
rather
earlier
than
usual
to
secure
the
dead
man
s
leavings
opened
the
door
whistling
as
he
came
in
but
when
he
was
at
arm
s
length
beauvoir
hit
him
such
a
tremendous
blow
on
the
head
that
the
wretch
fell
in
a
heap
without
a
cry
the
bar
had
cracked
his
skull
the
chevalier
hastily
stripped
him
and
put
on
his
clothes
mimicked
his
walk
and
thanks
to
the
early
hour
and
the
undoubting
confidence
of
the
warders
of
the
great
gate
he
walked
out
and
it
did
not
seem
to
strike
either
the
lawyer
or
madame
de
la
baudraye
that
there
was
in
this
narrative
the
least
allusion
that
should
apply
to
them
those
in
the
little
plot
looked
inquiringly
at
each
other
evidently
surprised
at
the
perfect
coolness
of
the
two
supposed
lovers
oh
i
can
tell
you
a
better
story
than
that
said
bianchon
let
us
hear
said
the
audience
at
a
sign
from
lousteau
conveying
that
bianchon
had
a
reputation
as
a
among
the
stock
of
narratives
he
had
in
store
for
every
clever
man
has
a
fund
of
anecdotes
as
madame
de
la
baudraye
had
a
collection
of
phrases
the
doctor
chose
that
which
is
known
as
grande
and
is
so
famous
indeed
that
it
was
put
on
the
stage
at
the
under
the
title
of
so
it
is
not
necessary
to
repeat
it
here
though
it
was
then
new
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
chateau
d
anzy
and
it
was
told
with
the
same
finish
of
gesture
and
tone
which
had
won
such
praise
for
bianchon
when
at
mademoiselle
des
touches
he
had
told
it
for
the
first
time
the
final
picture
of
the
spanish
grandee
starved
to
death
where
he
stood
in
the
cupboard
walled
up
by
madame
de
merret
s
husband
and
that
husband
s
last
word
as
he
replied
to
his
wife
s
entreaty
you
swore
on
that
crucifix
that
there
was
no
one
in
that
closet
produced
their
full
effect
there
was
a
silent
minute
highly
flattering
to
bianchon
do
you
know
gentlemen
said
madame
de
la
baudraye
love
must
be
a
mighty
thing
that
it
can
tempt
a
woman
to
put
herself
in
such
a
position
i
who
have
certainly
seen
some
strange
things
in
the
course
of
my
life
said
gravier
was
cognizant
in
spain
of
an
adventure
of
the
same
you
come
forward
after
two
great
performers
said
madame
de
la
baudraye
with
coquettish
flattery
as
she
glanced
at
the
two
parisians
but
never
mind
some
little
time
after
his
entry
into
madrid
said
the
the
grand
duke
of
berg
invited
the
magnates
of
the
capital
to
an
entertainment
given
to
the
newly
conquered
city
by
the
french
army
in
spite
of
the
splendor
of
the
affair
the
spaniards
were
not
very
cheerful
their
ladies
hardly
danced
at
all
and
most
of
the
company
sat
down
to
cards
the
gardens
of
the
duke
s
palace
were
so
brilliantly
illuminated
that
the
ladies
could
walk
about
in
as
perfect
safety
as
in
broad
daylight
the
fete
was
of
imperial
magnificence
nothing
was
grudged
to
give
the
spaniards
a
high
idea
of
the
emperor
if
they
were
to
measure
him
by
the
standard
of
his
officers
in
an
arbor
near
the
house
between
one
and
two
in
the
morning
a
party
of
french
officers
were
discussing
the
chances
of
war
and
the
not
too
hopeful
outlook
prognosticated
by
the
conduct
of
the
spaniards
present
at
that
grand
ball
i
can
only
tell
you
said
the
of
the
company
of
which
i
was
paymaster
i
applied
formally
to
prince
murat
only
yesterday
to
be
recalled
without
being
afraid
exactly
of
leaving
my
bones
in
the
peninsula
i
would
rather
dress
the
wounds
made
by
our
worthy
neighbors
the
germans
their
weapons
do
not
run
quite
so
deep
into
the
body
as
these
castilian
daggers
besides
a
certain
dread
of
spain
is
with
me
a
sort
of
superstition
from
my
earliest
youth
i
have
read
spanish
books
and
a
heap
of
gloomy
romances
and
tales
of
adventures
in
this
country
have
given
me
a
serious
prejudice
against
its
manners
and
customs
well
now
since
my
arrival
in
madrid
i
have
already
been
not
indeed
the
hero
but
the
accomplice
of
a
dangerous
intrigue
as
dark
and
mysterious
as
any
romance
by
lady
radcliffe
i
am
apt
to
attend
to
my
presentiments
and
i
am
off
murat
will
not
refuse
me
leave
for
thanks
to
our
varied
services
we
always
have
influential
since
you
mean
to
cut
your
stick
tell
us
what
s
up
said
an
old
republican
colonel
who
cared
not
a
rap
for
imperial
gentility
and
choice
language
the
looked
about
him
cautiously
as
if
to
make
sure
who
were
his
audience
and
being
satisfied
that
no
spaniard
was
within
hearing
he
said
we
are
none
but
frenchmen
then
with
pleasure
colonel
hulot
about
six
days
since
i
was
quietly
going
home
at
about
eleven
at
night
after
leaving
general
montcornet
whose
hotel
is
but
a
few
yards
from
mine
we
had
come
away
together
from
the
s
where
we
had
played
rather
high
at
suddenly
at
the
corner
of
a
narrow
two
strangers
or
rather
two
demons
rushed
upon
me
and
flung
a
large
cloak
round
my
head
and
arms
i
yelled
out
as
you
may
suppose
like
a
dog
that
is
thrashed
but
the
cloth
smothered
my
voice
and
i
was
lifted
into
a
chaise
with
dexterous
rapidity
when
my
two
companions
released
me
from
the
cloak
i
heard
these
dreadful
words
spoken
by
a
woman
in
bad
french
if
you
cry
out
or
if
you
attempt
to
escape
if
you
make
the
very
least
suspicious
demonstration
the
gentleman
opposite
to
you
will
stab
you
without
hesitation
so
you
had
better
keep
now
i
will
tell
you
why
you
have
been
carried
off
if
you
will
take
the
trouble
to
put
your
hand
out
in
this
direction
you
will
find
your
case
of
instruments
lying
between
us
we
sent
a
messenger
for
them
to
your
rooms
in
your
name
you
will
need
them
we
are
taking
you
to
a
house
that
you
may
save
the
honor
of
a
lady
who
is
about
to
give
birth
to
a
child
that
she
wishes
to
place
in
this
gentleman
s
keeping
without
her
husband
s
knowledge
though
monsieur
rarely
leaves
his
wife
with
whom
he
is
still
passionately
in
love
watching
over
her
with
all
the
vigilance
of
spanish
jealousy
she
had
succeeded
in
concealing
her
condition
he
believes
her
to
be
you
must
bring
the
child
into
the
world
the
dangers
of
this
enterprise
do
not
concern
us
only
you
must
obey
us
otherwise
the
lover
who
is
sitting
opposite
to
you
in
this
carriage
and
who
does
not
understand
a
word
of
french
will
kill
you
on
the
least
rash
and
who
are
you
i
asked
feeling
for
the
speaker
s
hand
for
her
arm
was
inside
the
sleeve
of
a
soldier
s
uniform
i
am
my
lady
s
said
she
and
ready
to
reward
you
with
my
own
person
if
you
show
yourself
gallant
and
helpful
in
our
gladly
said
i
seeing
that
i
was
inevitably
started
on
a
perilous
adventure
under
favor
of
the
darkness
i
felt
whether
the
person
and
figure
of
the
girl
were
in
keeping
with
the
idea
i
had
formed
of
her
from
her
tone
of
voice
the
good
soul
had
no
doubt
made
up
her
mind
from
the
first
to
accept
all
the
chances
of
this
strange
act
of
kidnapping
for
she
kept
silence
very
obligingly
and
the
coach
had
not
been
more
than
ten
minutes
on
the
way
when
she
accepted
and
returned
a
very
satisfactory
kiss
the
lover
who
sat
opposite
to
me
took
no
offence
at
an
occasional
quite
involuntary
kick
as
he
did
not
understand
french
i
conclude
he
paid
no
heed
to
them
i
can
be
your
mistress
on
one
condition
only
said
the
woman
in
reply
to
the
nonsense
i
poured
into
her
ear
carried
away
by
the
fervor
of
an
improvised
passion
to
which
everything
was
unpropitious
and
what
is
it
that
you
will
never
attempt
to
find
out
whose
servant
i
am
if
i
am
to
go
to
you
it
must
be
at
night
and
you
must
receive
me
in
the
very
good
said
i
we
had
got
as
far
as
this
when
the
carriage
drew
up
under
a
garden
wall
you
must
allow
me
to
bandage
your
eyes
said
the
maid
you
can
lean
on
my
arm
and
i
will
lead
she
tied
a
handkerchief
over
my
eyes
fastening
it
in
a
tight
knot
at
the
back
of
my
head
i
heard
the
sound
of
a
key
being
cautiously
fitted
to
the
lock
of
a
little
side
door
by
the
speechless
lover
who
had
sat
opposite
to
me
in
a
moment
the
whose
shape
was
slender
and
who
walked
with
an
elegant
jauntiness
as
they
call
it
monsieur
gravier
explained
in
a
superior
tone
a
word
which
describes
the
swing
which
women
contrive
to
give
a
certain
part
of
their
dress
that
shall
be
the
it
is
the
who
is
speaking
the
narrator
went
on
led
me
along
the
gravel
walks
of
a
large
garden
till
at
a
certain
spot
she
stopped
from
the
louder
sound
of
our
footsteps
i
concluded
that
we
were
close
to
the
house
now
silence
said
she
in
a
whisper
and
mind
what
you
are
about
do
not
overlook
any
of
my
signals
i
can
not
speak
without
terrible
danger
for
both
of
us
and
at
this
moment
your
life
is
of
the
first
then
she
added
my
mistress
is
in
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
to
get
into
it
we
must
pass
through
her
husband
s
room
and
close
to
his
bed
do
not
cough
walk
softly
and
follow
me
closely
so
as
not
to
knock
against
the
furniture
or
tread
anywhere
but
on
the
carpets
i
laid
here
the
lover
gave
an
impatient
growl
as
a
man
annoyed
by
so
much
delay
the
woman
said
no
more
i
heard
a
door
open
i
felt
the
warm
air
of
the
house
and
we
stole
in
like
thieves
presently
the
girl
s
light
hand
removed
the
bandage
i
found
myself
in
a
lofty
and
spacious
room
badly
lighted
by
a
smoky
lamp
the
window
was
open
but
the
jealous
husband
had
fitted
it
with
iron
bars
i
was
in
the
bottom
of
a
sack
as
it
were
on
the
ground
a
woman
was
lying
on
a
mat
her
head
was
covered
with
a
muslin
veil
but
i
could
see
her
eyes
through
it
full
of
tears
and
flashing
with
the
brightness
of
stars
she
held
a
handkerchief
in
her
mouth
biting
it
so
hard
that
her
teeth
were
set
in
it
i
never
saw
finer
limbs
but
her
body
was
writhing
with
pain
like
a
thrown
on
the
fire
the
poor
creature
had
made
a
sort
of
struts
of
her
legs
by
setting
her
feet
against
a
chest
of
drawers
and
with
both
hands
she
held
on
to
the
bar
of
a
chair
her
arms
outstretched
with
every
vein
painfully
swelled
she
might
have
been
a
criminal
undergoing
torture
but
she
did
not
utter
a
cry
there
was
not
a
sound
all
three
speechless
and
motionless
the
husband
snored
with
reassuring
regularity
i
wanted
to
study
the
s
face
but
she
had
put
on
a
mask
which
she
had
removed
no
doubt
during
our
drive
and
i
could
see
nothing
but
a
pair
of
black
eyes
and
a
pleasingly
rounded
figure
the
lover
threw
some
towels
over
his
mistress
legs
and
folded
the
muslin
veil
double
over
her
face
as
soon
as
i
had
examined
the
lady
with
care
i
perceived
from
certain
symptoms
which
i
had
noted
once
before
on
a
very
sad
occasion
in
my
life
that
the
infant
was
dead
i
turned
to
the
maid
in
order
to
tell
her
this
instantly
the
suspicious
stranger
drew
his
dagger
but
i
had
time
to
explain
the
matter
to
the
woman
who
explained
in
a
word
or
two
to
him
in
a
low
voice
on
hearing
my
opinion
a
quick
slight
shudder
ran
through
him
from
head
to
foot
like
a
lightning
flash
i
fancied
i
could
see
him
turn
pale
under
his
black
velvet
mask
the
took
advantage
of
a
moment
when
he
was
bending
in
despair
over
the
dying
woman
who
had
turned
blue
to
point
to
some
glasses
of
lemonade
standing
on
a
table
at
the
same
time
shaking
her
head
negatively
i
understood
that
i
was
not
to
drink
anything
in
spite
of
the
dreadful
thirst
that
parched
my
throat
the
lover
was
thirsty
too
he
took
an
empty
glass
poured
out
some
fresh
lemonade
and
drank
it
off
at
this
moment
the
lady
had
a
violent
attack
of
pain
which
showed
me
that
now
was
the
time
to
operate
i
summoned
all
my
courage
and
in
about
an
hour
had
succeeded
in
delivering
her
of
the
child
cutting
it
up
to
extract
it
the
spaniard
no
longer
thought
of
poisoning
me
understanding
that
i
had
saved
the
mother
s
life
large
tears
fell
on
his
cloak
the
woman
uttered
no
sound
but
she
trembled
like
a
hunted
animal
and
was
bathed
in
sweat
at
one
horribly
critical
moment
she
pointed
in
the
direction
of
her
husband
s
room
he
had
turned
in
his
sleep
and
she
alone
had
heard
the
rustle
of
the
sheets
the
creaking
of
the
bed
or
of
the
curtain
we
all
paused
and
the
lover
and
the
through
the
eyeholes
of
their
masks
gave
each
other
a
look
that
said
if
he
wakes
shall
we
kill
him
at
that
instant
i
put
out
my
hand
to
take
the
glass
of
lemonade
the
spaniard
had
drunk
of
he
thinking
that
i
was
about
to
take
one
of
the
full
glasses
sprang
forward
like
a
cat
and
laid
his
long
dagger
over
the
two
poisoned
goblets
leaving
me
his
own
and
signing
to
me
to
drink
what
was
left
so
much
was
conveyed
by
this
quick
action
and
it
was
so
full
of
good
feeling
that
i
forgave
him
his
atrocious
schemes
for
killing
me
and
thus
burying
every
trace
of
this
event
after
two
hours
of
care
and
alarms
the
maid
and
i
put
her
mistress
to
bed
the
lover
forced
into
so
perilous
an
adventure
had
to
provide
means
in
case
of
having
to
fly
a
packet
of
diamonds
stuck
to
paper
these
he
put
into
my
pocket
without
my
knowing
it
and
i
may
add
parenthetically
that
as
i
was
ignorant
of
the
spaniard
s
magnificent
gift
my
servant
stole
the
jewels
the
day
after
and
went
off
with
a
perfect
fortune
i
whispered
my
instructions
to
the
as
to
the
further
care
of
her
patient
and
wanted
to
be
gone
the
maid
remained
with
her
mistress
which
was
not
very
reassuring
but
i
was
on
my
guard
the
lover
made
a
bundle
of
the
dead
infant
and
the
clothes
tying
it
up
tightly
and
hiding
it
under
his
cloak
he
passed
his
hand
over
my
eyes
as
if
to
bid
me
to
see
nothing
and
signed
to
me
to
take
hold
of
the
skirt
of
his
coat
he
went
first
out
of
the
room
and
i
followed
not
without
a
parting
glance
at
my
lady
of
an
hour
she
seeing
the
spaniard
had
gone
out
snatched
off
her
mask
and
showed
me
an
exquisite
face
when
i
found
myself
in
the
garden
in
the
open
air
i
confess
that
i
breathed
as
if
a
heavy
load
had
been
lifted
from
my
breast
i
followed
my
guide
at
a
respectful
distance
watching
his
least
movement
with
keen
attention
having
reached
the
little
door
he
took
my
hand
and
pressed
a
seal
to
my
lips
set
in
a
ring
which
i
had
seen
him
wearing
on
a
finger
of
his
left
hand
and
i
gave
him
to
understand
that
this
significant
sign
would
be
obeyed
in
the
street
two
horses
were
waiting
we
each
mounted
one
my
spaniard
took
my
bridle
held
his
own
between
his
teeth
for
his
right
hand
held
the
bloodstained
bundle
and
we
went
off
at
lightning
speed
i
could
not
see
the
smallest
object
by
which
to
retrace
the
road
we
came
by
at
dawn
i
found
myself
close
by
my
own
door
and
the
spaniard
fled
towards
the
atocha
and
you
saw
nothing
which
could
lead
you
to
suspect
who
the
woman
was
whom
you
had
attended
the
colonel
asked
of
the
surgeon
one
thing
only
he
replied
when
i
turned
the
unknown
lady
over
i
happened
to
remark
a
mole
on
her
arm
about
down
as
big
as
a
lentil
and
surrounded
with
brown
at
this
instant
the
rash
speaker
turned
pale
all
our
eyes
that
had
been
fixed
on
his
followed
his
glance
and
we
saw
a
spaniard
whose
glittering
eyes
shone
through
a
clump
of
on
finding
himself
the
object
of
our
attention
the
man
vanished
with
the
swiftness
of
a
sylph
a
young
captain
rushed
in
pursuit
by
heaven
cried
the
surgeon
that
basilisk
stare
has
chilled
me
through
my
friends
i
can
hear
bells
ringing
in
my
ears
i
may
take
leave
of
you
you
will
bury
me
here
what
a
fool
you
are
exclaimed
colonel
hulot
falcon
is
on
the
track
of
the
spaniard
who
was
listening
and
he
will
call
him
to
well
cried
one
and
another
seeing
the
captain
return
quite
out
of
breath
the
devil
s
in
it
said
falcon
the
man
went
through
a
wall
i
believe
as
i
do
not
suppose
that
he
is
a
wizard
i
fancy
he
must
belong
to
the
house
he
knows
every
corner
and
turning
and
easily
i
am
done
for
said
the
surgeon
in
a
gloomy
voice
come
come
keep
calm
bega
said
i
his
name
was
bega
we
will
sit
on
watch
with
you
till
you
leave
we
will
not
leave
you
this
in
point
of
fact
three
young
officers
who
had
been
losing
at
play
went
home
with
the
surgeon
to
his
lodgings
and
one
of
us
offered
to
stay
with
him
within
two
days
bega
had
obtained
his
recall
to
france
he
made
arrangements
to
travel
with
a
lady
to
whom
murat
had
given
a
strong
escort
and
had
just
finished
dinner
with
a
party
of
friends
when
his
servant
came
to
say
that
a
young
lady
wished
to
speak
to
him
the
surgeon
and
the
three
officers
went
down
suspecting
mischief
the
stranger
could
only
say
be
on
your
guard
when
she
dropped
down
dead
it
was
the
who
finding
she
had
been
poisoned
had
hoped
to
arrive
in
time
to
warn
her
lover
devil
take
it
cried
captain
falcon
that
is
what
i
call
love
no
woman
on
earth
but
a
spaniard
can
run
about
with
a
dose
of
poison
in
her
inside
bega
remained
strangely
pensive
to
drown
the
dark
presentiments
that
haunted
him
he
sat
down
to
table
again
and
with
his
companions
drank
immoderately
the
whole
party
went
early
to
bed
half
drunk
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
hapless
bega
was
aroused
by
the
sharp
rattle
of
the
curtain
rings
pulled
violently
along
the
rods
he
sat
up
in
bed
in
the
mechanical
trepidation
which
we
all
feel
on
waking
with
such
a
start
he
saw
standing
before
him
a
spaniard
wrapped
in
a
cloak
who
fixed
on
him
the
same
burning
gaze
that
he
had
seen
through
the
bushes
bega
shouted
out
help
help
come
at
once
friends
but
the
spaniard
answered
his
cry
of
distress
with
a
bitter
opium
grows
for
all
said
he
having
thus
pronounced
sentence
as
it
were
the
stranger
pointed
to
the
three
other
men
sleeping
soundly
took
from
under
his
cloak
the
arm
of
a
woman
freshly
amputated
and
held
it
out
to
bega
pointing
to
a
mole
like
that
he
had
so
rashly
described
is
it
the
same
he
asked
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
the
man
had
set
on
the
bed
bega
recognized
the
arm
and
his
speechless
amazement
was
answer
enough
without
waiting
for
further
information
the
lady
s
husband
stabbed
him
to
the
you
must
tell
that
to
the
marines
said
lousteau
it
needs
their
robust
faith
to
swallow
it
can
you
tell
me
which
told
the
tale
the
dead
man
or
the
spaniard
monsieur
replied
the
i
nursed
poor
bega
who
died
five
days
after
in
dreadful
that
is
not
the
end
at
the
time
of
the
expedition
sent
out
to
restore
ferdinand
vii
i
was
appointed
to
a
place
in
spain
but
happily
for
me
i
got
no
further
than
tours
when
i
was
promised
the
post
of
receiver
here
at
sancerre
on
the
eve
of
setting
out
i
was
at
a
ball
at
madame
de
listomere
s
where
we
were
to
meet
several
spaniards
of
high
rank
on
rising
from
the
i
saw
a
spanish
grandee
an
in
exile
who
had
been
about
a
fortnight
in
touraine
he
had
arrived
very
late
at
this
ball
his
first
appearance
in
society
accompanied
by
his
wife
whose
right
arm
was
perfectly
motionless
everybody
made
way
in
silence
for
this
couple
whom
we
all
watched
with
some
excitement
imagine
a
picture
by
murillo
come
to
life
under
black
and
hollow
brows
the
man
s
eyes
were
like
a
fixed
blaze
his
face
looked
dried
up
his
bald
skull
was
red
and
his
frame
was
a
terror
to
behold
he
was
so
emaciated
his
wife
no
you
can
not
imagine
her
her
figure
had
the
supple
swing
for
which
the
spaniards
created
the
word
though
pale
she
was
still
beautiful
her
complexion
was
dazzlingly
fair
a
rare
thing
in
a
spaniard
and
her
gaze
full
of
the
spanish
sun
fell
on
you
like
a
stream
of
melted
lead
madame
said
i
to
her
towards
the
end
of
the
evening
what
occurrence
led
to
the
loss
of
your
arm
i
lost
it
in
the
war
of
independence
said
spain
is
a
strange
country
said
madame
de
la
baudraye
it
still
shows
traces
of
arab
oh
said
the
journalist
laughing
the
mania
for
cutting
off
arms
is
an
old
one
there
it
turns
up
every
now
and
then
like
some
of
our
newspaper
hoaxes
for
the
subject
has
given
plots
for
plays
on
the
spanish
stage
so
early
as
then
do
you
think
me
capable
of
inventing
such
a
story
said
monsieur
gravier
nettled
by
lousteau
s
impertinent
tone
quite
incapable
of
such
a
thing
said
the
journalist
with
grave
irony
pooh
said
bianchon
the
inventions
of
romances
and
are
quite
as
often
transferred
from
their
books
and
pieces
into
real
life
as
the
events
of
real
life
are
made
use
of
on
the
stage
or
adapted
to
a
tale
i
have
seen
the
comedy
of
played
out
with
the
exception
of
the
close
orgon
s
eyes
could
not
be
opened
to
the
and
the
of
by
benjamin
constant
is
constantly
enacted
cried
lousteau
and
do
you
suppose
asked
madame
de
la
baudraye
that
such
adventures
as
monsieur
gravier
has
related
could
ever
occur
now
and
in
france
dear
me
cried
clagny
of
the
ten
or
twelve
startling
crimes
that
are
annually
committed
in
france
quite
half
are
mixed
up
with
circumstances
at
least
as
extraordinary
as
these
and
often
outdoing
them
in
romantic
details
indeed
is
not
this
proved
by
the
reports
in
the
des
the
police
news
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
worst
abuses
of
the
press
this
newspaper
which
was
started
only
in
or
was
not
in
existence
when
i
began
my
professional
career
and
the
facts
of
the
crime
i
am
about
to
speak
of
were
not
known
beyond
the
limits
of
the
department
where
it
was
committed
in
the
quarter
of
at
tours
a
woman
whose
husband
had
disappeared
at
the
time
when
the
army
of
the
loire
was
disbanded
and
who
had
mourned
him
deeply
was
conspicuous
for
her
excess
of
devotion
when
the
mission
priests
went
through
all
the
provinces
to
restore
the
crosses
that
had
been
destroyed
and
to
efface
the
traces
of
revolutionary
impiety
this
widow
was
one
of
their
most
zealous
proselytes
she
carried
a
cross
and
nailed
to
it
a
silver
heart
pierced
by
an
arrow
and
for
a
long
time
after
she
went
every
evening
to
pray
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
which
was
erected
behind
the
cathedral
apse
at
last
overwhelmed
by
remorse
she
confessed
to
a
horrible
crime
she
had
killed
her
husband
as
fualdes
was
murdered
by
bleeding
him
she
had
salted
the
body
and
packed
it
in
pieces
into
old
casks
exactly
as
if
it
have
been
pork
and
for
a
long
time
she
had
taken
a
piece
every
morning
and
thrown
it
into
the
loire
her
confessor
consulted
his
superiors
and
told
her
that
it
would
be
his
duty
to
inform
the
public
prosecutor
the
woman
awaited
the
action
of
the
law
the
public
prosecutor
and
the
examining
judge
on
examining
the
cellar
found
the
husband
s
head
still
in
pickle
in
one
of
the
wretched
woman
said
the
judge
to
the
accused
since
you
were
so
barbarous
as
to
throw
your
husband
s
body
into
the
river
why
did
you
not
get
rid
of
the
head
then
there
would
have
been
no
i
often
tried
monsieur
said
she
but
it
was
too
well
and
what
became
of
the
woman
asked
the
two
parisians
she
was
sentenced
and
executed
at
tours
replied
the
lawyer
but
her
repentance
and
piety
had
attracted
interest
in
spite
of
her
monstrous
and
do
you
suppose
said
bianchon
that
we
know
all
the
tragedies
that
are
played
out
behind
the
curtain
of
private
life
that
the
public
never
lifts
it
seems
to
me
that
human
justice
is
ill
adapted
to
judge
of
crimes
as
between
husband
and
wife
it
has
every
right
to
intervene
as
the
police
but
in
equity
it
knows
nothing
of
the
heart
of
the
the
victim
has
in
many
cases
been
for
so
long
the
tormentor
said
madame
de
la
baudraye
guilelessly
that
the
crime
would
sometimes
seem
almost
excusable
if
the
accused
could
tell
this
reply
led
up
to
by
bianchon
and
by
the
story
which
clagny
had
told
left
the
two
parisians
excessively
puzzled
as
to
dinah
s
position
at
bedtime
council
was
held
one
of
those
discussions
which
take
place
in
the
passages
of
old
where
the
bachelors
linger
candle
in
hand
for
mysterious
conversations
monsieur
gravier
was
now
informed
of
the
object
in
view
during
this
entertaining
evening
which
had
brought
madame
de
la
baudraye
s
innocence
to
light
but
after
all
said
lousteau
our
hostess
serenity
may
indicate
deep
depravity
instead
of
the
most
innocence
the
public
prosecutor
looks
to
me
quite
capable
of
suggesting
that
little
la
baudraye
should
be
put
in
pickle
he
is
not
to
return
till
who
knows
what
may
happen
in
the
course
of
the
night
said
gatien
we
will
know
cried
monsieur
gravier
in
the
life
of
a
country
house
a
number
of
practical
jokes
are
considered
admissible
some
of
them
odiously
treacherous
monsieur
gravier
who
had
seen
so
much
of
the
world
proposed
setting
seals
on
the
door
of
madame
de
la
baudraye
and
of
the
public
prosecutor
the
ducks
that
denounced
the
poet
ibycus
are
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
single
hair
that
these
country
spies
fasten
across
the
opening
of
a
door
by
means
of
two
little
flattened
pills
of
wax
fixed
so
high
up
or
so
low
down
that
the
trick
is
never
suspected
if
the
gallant
comes
out
of
his
own
door
and
opens
the
other
the
broken
hair
tells
the
tale
when
everybody
was
supposed
to
be
asleep
the
doctor
the
journalist
the
receiver
of
taxes
and
gatien
came
barefoot
like
robbers
and
silently
fastened
up
the
two
doors
agreeing
to
come
again
at
five
in
the
morning
to
examine
the
state
of
the
fastenings
imagine
their
astonishment
and
gatien
s
delight
when
all
four
candle
in
hand
and
with
hardly
any
clothes
on
came
to
look
at
the
hairs
and
found
them
in
perfect
preservation
on
both
doors
is
it
the
same
wax
asked
monsieur
gravier
are
they
the
same
hairs
asked
lousteau
yes
replied
gatien
this
quite
alters
the
matter
cried
lousteau
you
have
been
beating
the
bush
for
a
monsieur
gravier
and
gatien
exchanged
questioning
glances
which
were
meant
to
convey
is
there
not
something
offensive
to
us
in
that
speech
ought
we
to
laugh
or
to
be
angry
if
dinah
is
virtuous
said
the
journalist
in
a
whisper
to
bianchon
she
is
worth
an
effort
on
my
part
to
pluck
the
fruit
of
her
first
the
idea
of
carrying
by
storm
a
fortress
that
had
for
nine
years
stood
out
against
the
besiegers
of
sancerre
smiled
on
lousteau
with
this
notion
in
his
head
he
was
the
first
to
go
down
and
into
the
garden
hoping
to
meet
his
hostess
and
this
chance
fell
out
all
the
more
easily
because
madame
de
la
baudraye
on
her
part
wished
to
converse
with
her
critic
half
such
chances
are
planned
you
were
out
shooting
yesterday
monsieur
said
madame
de
la
baudraye
this
morning
i
am
rather
puzzled
as
to
how
to
find
you
any
new
amusement
unless
you
would
like
to
come
to
la
baudraye
where
you
may
study
more
of
our
provincial
life
than
you
can
see
here
for
you
have
made
but
one
mouthful
of
my
absurdities
however
the
saying
about
the
handsomest
girl
in
the
world
is
not
less
true
of
the
poor
provincial
woman
that
little
simpleton
gatien
has
i
suppose
related
to
you
a
speech
i
made
simply
to
make
him
confess
that
he
adored
you
said
etienne
your
silence
during
dinner
the
day
before
yesterday
and
throughout
the
evening
was
enough
to
betray
one
of
those
indiscretions
which
we
never
commit
in
what
can
i
say
i
do
not
flatter
myself
that
you
will
understand
me
in
fact
i
laid
a
plot
for
the
telling
of
all
those
stories
yesterday
solely
to
see
whether
i
could
rouse
you
and
monsieur
de
clagny
to
a
pang
of
oh
be
quite
easy
your
innocence
is
fully
proved
if
you
had
the
slightest
fancy
for
that
estimable
magistrate
you
would
have
lost
all
your
value
in
my
i
love
perfection
you
do
not
you
can
not
love
that
cold
taciturn
little
usurer
on
wine
casks
and
land
who
would
leave
any
man
in
the
lurch
for
centimes
on
a
renewal
oh
i
have
fully
recognized
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
s
similarity
to
a
parisian
their
nature
is
at
handsome
well
conducted
and
childless
i
assure
you
madame
i
never
saw
the
problem
of
virtue
more
admirably
the
author
of
la
must
have
dreamed
many
dreams
i
can
speak
of
such
things
without
the
hypocritical
gloss
lent
them
by
young
men
for
i
am
old
before
my
time
i
have
no
illusions
left
can
a
man
have
any
illusions
in
the
trade
i
follow
by
opening
the
game
in
this
tone
lousteau
cut
out
all
excursions
in
the
de
where
genuine
passion
beats
the
bush
so
long
he
went
straight
to
the
point
and
placed
himself
in
a
position
to
force
the
offer
of
what
women
often
make
a
man
pray
for
for
years
witness
the
hapless
public
prosecutor
to
whom
the
greatest
favor
had
consisted
in
clasping
dinah
s
hand
to
his
heart
more
tenderly
than
usual
as
they
walked
happy
man
and
madame
de
la
baudraye
to
be
true
to
her
reputation
as
a
superior
woman
tried
to
console
the
manfred
of
the
press
by
prophesying
such
a
future
of
love
as
he
had
not
had
in
his
mind
you
have
sought
pleasure
said
she
but
you
have
never
loved
believe
me
true
love
often
comes
late
in
life
remember
monsieur
de
gentz
who
fell
in
love
in
his
old
age
with
fanny
ellsler
and
left
the
revolution
of
july
to
take
its
course
while
he
attended
the
dancer
s
it
seems
to
me
unlikely
replied
lousteau
i
can
still
believe
in
love
but
i
have
ceased
to
believe
in
woman
there
are
in
me
i
suppose
certain
defects
which
hinder
me
from
being
loved
for
i
have
often
been
thrown
over
perhaps
i
have
too
strong
a
feeling
for
the
ideal
like
all
men
who
have
looked
too
closely
into
reality
madame
de
la
baudraye
at
last
heard
the
mind
of
a
man
who
flung
into
the
wittiest
parisian
circles
represented
to
her
its
most
daring
axioms
its
almost
artless
depravity
its
advanced
convictions
who
if
he
were
not
really
superior
acted
superiority
extremely
well
etienne
performing
before
dinah
had
all
the
success
of
a
first
night
of
sancerre
scented
the
storms
the
atmosphere
of
paris
she
spent
one
of
the
most
delightful
days
of
her
life
with
lousteau
and
bianchon
who
told
her
strange
tales
about
the
great
men
of
the
day
the
anecdotes
which
will
some
day
form
the
of
our
century
sayings
and
doings
that
were
the
common
talk
of
paris
but
quite
new
to
her
of
course
lousteau
spoke
very
ill
of
the
great
female
celebrity
of
le
berry
with
the
obvious
intention
of
flattering
madame
de
la
baudraye
and
leading
her
into
literary
confidences
by
suggesting
that
she
could
rival
so
great
a
writer
this
praise
intoxicated
madame
de
la
baudraye
and
monsieur
de
clagny
monsieur
gravier
and
gatien
all
thought
her
warmer
in
her
manner
to
etienne
than
she
had
been
on
the
previous
day
dinah
s
three
greatly
regretted
having
all
gone
to
sancerre
to
blow
the
trumpet
in
honor
of
the
evening
at
anzy
nothing
to
hear
them
had
ever
been
so
brilliant
the
hours
had
fled
on
feet
so
light
that
none
had
marked
their
pace
the
two
parisians
they
spoke
of
as
perfect
prodigies
these
exaggerated
reports
loudly
proclaimed
on
the
mall
brought
sixteen
persons
to
anzy
that
evening
some
in
family
coaches
some
in
wagonettes
and
a
few
bachelors
on
hired
saddle
horses
by
about
seven
o
clock
this
provincial
company
had
made
a
more
or
less
graceful
entry
into
the
huge
anzy
which
dinah
warned
of
the
invasion
had
lighted
up
giving
it
all
the
lustre
it
was
capable
of
by
taking
the
holland
covers
off
the
handsome
furniture
for
she
regarded
this
assembly
as
one
of
her
great
triumphs
lousteau
bianchon
and
dinah
exchanged
meaning
looks
as
they
studied
the
attitudes
and
listened
to
the
speeches
of
these
visitors
attracted
by
curiosity
what
invalided
ribbons
what
ancestral
laces
what
ancient
flowers
more
imaginative
than
imitative
were
boldly
displayed
on
some
perennial
caps
the
presidente
boirouge
bianchon
s
cousin
exchanged
a
few
words
with
the
doctor
from
whom
she
extracted
some
advice
gratis
by
expatiating
on
certain
pains
in
the
chest
which
she
declared
were
nervous
but
which
he
ascribed
to
chronic
indigestion
simply
drink
a
cup
of
tea
every
day
an
hour
after
dinner
as
the
english
do
and
you
will
get
over
it
for
what
you
suffer
from
is
an
english
malady
bianchon
replied
very
gravely
he
is
certainly
a
great
physician
said
the
presidente
coming
back
to
madame
de
clagny
madame
and
madame
gorju
the
mayor
s
wife
they
say
replied
madame
de
clagny
behind
her
fan
that
dinah
sent
for
him
not
so
much
with
a
view
to
the
elections
as
to
ascertain
why
she
has
no
in
the
first
excitement
of
this
success
lousteau
introduced
the
great
doctor
as
the
only
possible
candidate
at
the
ensuing
elections
but
bianchon
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
new
remarked
that
it
seemed
to
him
almost
impossible
to
give
up
science
in
favor
of
politics
only
a
physician
without
a
practice
said
he
could
care
to
be
returned
as
a
deputy
nominate
statesmen
thinkers
men
whose
knowledge
is
universal
and
who
are
capable
of
placing
themselves
on
the
high
level
which
a
legislator
should
occupy
that
is
what
is
lacking
in
our
chambers
and
what
our
country
two
or
three
young
ladies
some
of
the
younger
men
and
the
elder
women
stared
at
lousteau
as
if
he
were
a
mountebank
monsieur
gatien
boirouge
declares
that
monsieur
lousteau
makes
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
by
his
writings
observed
the
mayor
s
wife
to
madame
de
clagny
can
you
believe
it
is
it
possible
why
a
public
prosecutor
gets
but
a
thousand
crowns
monsieur
gatien
said
madame
chandier
get
monsieur
lousteau
to
talk
a
little
louder
i
have
not
heard
him
what
pretty
boots
he
wears
said
mademoiselle
chandier
to
her
brother
and
how
they
shine
yes
patent
why
haven
t
you
the
same
lousteau
began
to
feel
that
he
was
too
much
on
show
and
saw
in
the
manners
of
the
good
townsfolk
indications
of
the
desires
that
had
brought
them
there
what
trick
can
i
play
them
thought
he
at
this
moment
the
footman
so
called
a
put
into
livery
brought
in
the
letters
and
papers
and
among
them
a
packet
of
proof
which
the
journalist
left
for
bianchon
for
madame
de
la
baudraye
on
seeing
the
parcel
of
which
the
form
and
string
were
obviously
from
the
printers
exclaimed
what
does
literature
pursue
you
even
here
not
literature
replied
he
but
a
review
in
which
i
am
now
finishing
a
story
to
come
out
ten
days
hence
i
have
reached
the
stage
of
be
concluded
in
our
so
i
was
obliged
to
give
my
address
to
the
printer
oh
we
eat
very
bread
at
the
hands
of
these
speculators
in
black
and
white
i
will
give
you
a
description
of
these
editors
of
when
will
the
conversation
begin
madame
de
clagny
asked
of
dinah
as
one
might
ask
when
do
the
fireworks
go
off
i
fancied
we
should
hear
some
amusing
stories
said
madame
popinot
to
her
cousin
the
presidente
boirouge
at
this
moment
when
the
good
folks
of
sancerre
were
beginning
to
murmur
like
an
impatient
pit
lousteau
observed
that
bianchon
was
lost
in
meditation
inspired
by
the
wrapper
round
the
proofs
what
is
it
asked
etienne
why
here
is
the
most
fascinating
romance
possible
on
some
spoiled
proof
used
to
wrap
yours
in
here
read
it
or
roman
let
us
see
said
lousteau
taking
the
sheet
the
doctor
held
out
to
him
and
he
read
aloud
as
follows
olympia
cavern
rinaldo
indignant
at
his
companions
cowardice
for
they
had
no
courage
but
in
the
open
field
and
dared
not
venture
into
rome
looked
at
them
with
scorn
then
i
go
alone
said
he
he
seemed
to
reflect
and
then
he
went
on
you
are
poor
wretches
i
shall
proceed
alone
and
have
the
rich
booty
to
you
hear
me
my
captain
said
lamberti
if
you
should
be
captured
without
having
succeeded
god
protects
me
said
rinaldo
pointing
to
the
sky
with
these
words
he
went
out
and
on
his
way
he
met
the
steward
that
is
the
end
of
the
page
said
lousteau
to
whom
every
one
had
listened
devoutly
he
is
reading
his
work
to
us
said
gatien
to
madame
s
son
from
the
first
word
ladies
said
the
journalist
jumping
at
an
opportunity
of
mystifying
the
natives
it
is
evident
that
the
brigands
are
in
a
cave
but
how
careless
romancers
of
that
date
were
as
to
details
which
are
nowadays
so
closely
so
elaborately
studied
under
the
name
of
local
if
the
robbers
were
in
a
cavern
instead
of
pointing
to
the
sky
he
ought
to
have
pointed
to
the
vault
above
in
spite
of
this
inaccuracy
rinaldo
strikes
me
as
a
man
of
spirit
and
his
appeal
to
god
is
quite
italian
there
must
have
been
a
touch
of
local
color
in
this
romance
why
what
with
brigands
and
a
cavern
and
one
lamberti
who
could
foresee
future
possibilities
there
is
a
whole
melodrama
in
that
page
add
to
these
elements
a
little
intrigue
a
peasant
maiden
with
her
hair
dressed
high
short
skirts
and
a
hundred
or
so
of
bad
oh
the
public
will
crowd
to
see
it
and
then
rinaldo
how
well
the
name
suits
lafont
by
giving
him
black
whiskers
trousers
a
cloak
a
moustache
a
pistol
and
a
peaked
hat
if
the
manager
of
the
vaudeville
theatre
were
but
bold
enough
to
pay
for
a
few
newspaper
articles
that
would
secure
fifty
performances
and
six
thousand
francs
for
the
author
s
rights
if
only
i
were
to
cry
it
up
in
my
columns
to
proceed
or
roman
revenge
the
duchess
of
bracciano
found
her
glove
adolphe
who
had
brought
her
back
to
the
orange
grove
might
certainly
have
supposed
that
there
was
some
purpose
in
her
ness
for
at
this
moment
the
arbor
was
deserted
the
sound
of
the
tivities
was
audible
in
the
distance
the
puppet
show
that
had
been
promised
had
attracted
all
the
guests
to
the
ballroom
never
had
olympia
looked
more
beautiful
her
lover
s
eyes
met
hers
with
an
answering
glow
and
they
stood
each
other
there
was
a
ment
of
silence
delicious
to
their
souls
and
impossible
to
describe
they
sat
down
on
the
same
bench
where
they
had
sat
in
the
presence
of
the
cavaliere
paluzzi
and
the
devil
take
it
our
rinaldo
has
vanished
cried
lousteau
but
a
literary
man
once
started
by
this
page
would
make
rapid
progress
in
the
comprehension
of
the
plot
the
duchesse
olympia
is
a
lady
who
could
intentionally
forget
her
gloves
in
a
deserted
unless
she
may
be
classed
between
the
oyster
and
of
an
office
the
two
creatures
nearest
to
marble
in
the
zoological
kingdom
it
is
impossible
to
discern
in

bianchon
began
a
woman
of
thirty
madame
de
la
baudraye
hastily
interposed
fearing
some
all
too
medical
term
then
adolphe
must
be
the
doctor
went
on
for
an
italian
woman
at
thirty
is
equivalent
to
a
parisian
of
from
these
two
facts
the
romance
may
easily
be
reconstructed
said
lousteau
and
this
cavaliere
paluzzi
what
a
man
the
style
is
weak
in
these
two
passages
the
author
was
perhaps
a
clerk
in
the
excise
office
and
wrote
the
novel
to
pay
his
tailor
in
his
time
said
bianchon
the
censor
flourished
you
must
show
as
much
indulgence
to
a
man
who
underwent
the
ordeal
by
scissors
in
as
to
those
who
went
to
the
scaffold
in
do
you
understand
in

least
asked
madame
gorju
timidly
of
madame
de
clagny
the
public
prosecutor
s
wife
who
to
use
a
phrase
of
monsieur
gravier
s
might
have
put
a
cossack
to
flight
in
straightened
herself
in
her
chair
like
a
horseman
in
his
stirrups
and
made
a
face
at
her
neighbor
conveying
they
are
looking
at
us
we
must
smile
as
if
we
charming
said
the
mayoress
to
gatien
pray
go
on
monsieur
lousteau
looked
at
the
two
women
two
indian
idols
and
contrived
to
keep
his
countenance
he
thought
it
desirable
to
say
attention
before
going

sud
denly
cardinal
borborigano
stood
before
the
duchess
his
face
was
gloomy
his
brow
was
dark
with
clouds
and
a
bitter
smile
lurked
in
his
wrinkles
madame
said
he
you
are
under
suspicion
if
you
are
guilty
fly
if
you
are
not

because
whether
criminal
or

said
she
the
duke
of
bracciano
will
reappear
when
i
find
it
needful
to
prove
that
he
is

borborigano
exclaimed
bianchon
by
the
pope
s
keys
if
you
do
not
agree
with
me
that
there
is
a
magnificent
creation
in
the
very
name
if
at
those
words
rustled
in
the
you
do
not
feel
all
the
poetry
thrown
into
the
part
of
schedoni
by
radcliffe
in
black
you
do
not
deserve
to
read
a
for
my
part
said
dinah
who
had
some
pity
on
the
eighteen
faces
gazing
up
at
lousteau
i
see
how
the
story
is
progressing
i
know
it
all
i
am
in
rome
i
can
see
the
body
of
a
murdered
husband
whose
wife
as
bold
as
she
is
wicked
has
made
her
bed
on
the
crater
of
a
volcano
every
night
at
every
kiss
she
says
to
herself
all
will
be
discovered
can
you
see
her
said
lousteau
clasping
monsieur
adolphe
in
her
arms
to
her
heart
throwing
her
whole
life
into
a
kiss
adolphe
i
see
as
a
young
man
but
not
clever
the
sort
of
man
an
italian
woman
likes
rinaldo
hovers
behind
the
scenes
of
a
plot
we
do
not
know
but
which
must
be
as
full
of
incident
as
a
melodrama
by
pixerecourt
or
we
can
imagine
rinaldo
crossing
the
stage
in
the
background
like
a
figure
in
one
of
victor
hugo
s
he
perhaps
is
the
husband
exclaimed
madame
de
la
baudraye
do
you
understand
anything
of
it
all
madame
piedefer
asked
of
the
presidente
why
it
is
charming
said
dinah
to
her
mother
all
the
good
folks
of
sancerre
sat
with
eyes
as
large
as
pieces
go
on
i
beg
said
the
hostess
lousteau
went
on
olympia
your
key
have
you
lost
it
it
is
in
the
let
us
can
the
cardinal
have
taken
it
no
here
it
what
danger
we
have
escaped
olympia
looked
at
the
key
and
fancied
she
recognized
it
as
her
own
but
rinaldo
had
changed
it
his
cunning
had
triumphed
he
had
the
right
key
like
a
modern
cartouche
he
was
no
less
skilful
than
bold
and
suspecting
that
nothing
but
a
vast
treasure
could
require
a
duchess
to
carry
it
constantly
at
her
belt
guess
cried
lousteau
the
corresponding
page
is
not
here
we
must
look
to
page
to
relieve
our
olympia
if
the
key
had
been
lost
he
would
now
be
a
dead
dead
but
ought
you
not
to
grant
the
last
request
he
made
and
to
give
him
his
liberty
on
the
ditions
you
do
not
know
but
silence
i
took
you
for
my
lover
not
for
my
adolphe
was
silent
and
then
comes
an
exquisite
galloping
goat
a
drawn
by
normand
and
cut
by
the
names
are
signed
said
lousteau
well
and
then
said
such
of
the
audience
as
understood
that
is
the
end
of
the
chapter
said
lousteau
the
fact
of
this
tailpiece
changes
my
views
as
to
the
authorship
to
have
his
book
got
up
under
the
empire
with
vignettes
engraved
on
wood
the
writer
must
have
been
a
councillor
of
state
or
madame
or
the
late
lamented
desforges
or
adolphe
was
ah
cried
bianchon
the
duchess
must
have
been
under
if
there
is
no
more
invent
a
conclusion
said
madame
de
la
baudraye
you
see
said
lousteau
the
waste
sheet
has
been
printed
fair
on
one
side
only
in
printer
s
lingo
it
is
a
back
sheet
or
to
make
it
clearer
the
other
side
which
would
have
to
be
printed
is
covered
all
over
with
pages
printed
one
above
another
all
experiments
in
making
up
it
would
take
too
long
to
explain
to
you
all
the
complications
of
a
sheet
but
you
may
understand
that
it
will
show
no
more
trace
of
the
first
twelve
pages
that
were
printed
on
it
than
you
would
in
the
least
remember
the
first
stroke
of
the
bastinado
if
a
pasha
condemned
you
to
have
fifty
on
the
soles
of
your
i
am
quite
bewildered
said
madame
to
monsieur
gravier
i
am
vainly
trying
to
connect
the
councillor
of
state
the
cardinal
the
key
and
the
you
have
not
the
key
to
the
jest
said
monsieur
gravier
well
no
more
have
i
fair
lady
if
that
can
comfort
but
here
is
another
sheet
said
bianchon
hunting
on
the
table
where
the
proofs
had
been
laid
capital
said
lousteau
and
it
is
complete
and
uninjured
it
is
signed
iv
j
second
edition
ladies
the
figure
iv
means
that
this
is
part
of
the
fourth
volume
the
letter
j
the
tenth
letter
of
the
alphabet
shows
that
this
is
the
tenth
sheet
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
to
me
that
in
spite
of
any
publisher
s
tricks
this
romance
in
four
duodecimo
volumes
had
a
great
success
since
it
came
to
a
second
we
will
read
on
and
find
a
clue
to
the
mystery
or
roman
revenge
corridor
but
finding
that
he
was
pursued
by
the
duchess
people
oh
get
along
but
said
madame
de
la
baudraye
some
important
events
have
taken
place
between
your
waste
sheet
and
this
this
complete
sheet
madame
this
precious
sheet
but
does
the
waste
sheet
in
which
the
duchess
forgets
her
gloves
in
the
arbor
belong
to
the
fourth
volume
well
deuce
take
it
to
proceed
rinaldo
saw
no
safer
refuge
than
to
make
forthwith
for
the
cellar
where
the
treasures
of
the
bracciano
ily
no
doubt
lay
hid
as
light
of
foot
as
camilla
sung
by
the
latin
poet
he
flew
to
the
entrance
to
the
baths
of
vespasian
the
torchlight
already
flickered
on
the
walls
when
rinaldo
with
the
readiness
stowed
on
him
by
nature
discovered
the
door
concealed
in
the
work
and
suddenly
vanished
a
hideous
thought
then
flashed
on
rinaldo
s
brain
like
lightning
ing
a
cloud
he
was
imprisoned
he
felt
the
wall
with
uneasy
haste
yes
this
sheet
follows
the
waste
sheet
the
last
page
of
the
damaged
sheet
was
and
this
is
in
fact
since
rinaldo
who
in
the
earlier
fragment
stole
the
key
of
the
duchess
treasure
by
exchanging
it
for
another
very
much
like
it
is
now
on
the
sheet
in
the
palace
of
the
dukes
of
bracciano
the
story
seems
to
me
to
be
advancing
to
a
conclusion
of
some
kind
i
hope
it
is
as
clear
to
you
as
it
is
to
i
understand
that
the
festivities
are
over
the
lovers
have
returned
to
the
bracciano
palace
it
is
night
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
rinaldo
will
have
a
good
and
adolphe
too
said
president
boirouge
who
was
considered
rather
free
in
his
speech
and
the
style
said
rinaldo
who
saw
better
refuge
than
to
make
for
the
it
is
quite
clear
that
neither
maradan
nor
treuttel
and
wurtz
nor
doguereau
were
the
printers
said
lousteau
for
they
employed
correctors
who
revised
the
proofs
a
luxury
in
which
our
publishers
might
very
well
indulge
and
the
writers
of
the
present
day
would
benefit
greatly
some
scrubby
pamphlet
printer
on
the
quay
what
quay
a
lady
asked
of
her
neighbor
they
spoke
of
baths
pray
go
on
said
madame
de
la
baudraye
at
any
rate
it
is
not
by
a
councillor
said
bianchon
it
may
be
by
madame
hadot
replied
lousteau
what
has
madame
hadot
of
la
charite
to
do
with
it
the
presidente
asked
of
her
son
this
madame
hadot
my
dear
friend
the
hostess
answered
was
an
authoress
who
lived
at
the
time
of
the
what
did
women
write
in
the
emperor
s
time
asked
madame
what
of
madame
de
genlis
and
madame
de
stael
cried
the
public
prosecutor
piqued
on
dinah
s
account
by
this
remark
to
be
sure
i
beg
you
to
go
on
said
madame
de
la
baudraye
to
lousteau
lousteau
went
on
saying
page
olympia
and
gave
a
shriek
of
despair
when
he
had
vainly
sought
any
trace
of
a
secret
spring
it
was
impossible
to
ignore
the
horrible
truth
the
door
cleverly
constructed
to
serve
the
vengeful
purposes
of
the
duchess
could
not
be
opened
from
within
rinaldo
laid
his
cheek
against
the
wall
in
various
spots
nowhere
could
he
feel
the
warmer
air
from
the
passage
he
had
hoped
he
might
find
a
crack
that
would
show
him
where
there
was
an
opening
in
the
wall
but
nothing
nothing
the
whole
seemed
to
be
of
one
block
of
marble
then
he
gave
a
hollow
roar
like
that
of
a
hyaena
well
we
fancied
that
the
cry
of
the
hyaena
was
a
recent
invention
of
our
own
said
lousteau
and
here
it
was
already
known
to
the
literature
of
the
empire
it
is
even
introduced
with
a
certain
skill
in
natural
history
as
we
see
in
the
word
make
no
more
comments
monsieur
said
madame
de
la
baudraye
there
you
see
cried
bianchon
interest
the
romantic
demon
has
you
by
the
collar
as
he
had
me
a
while
read
on
cried
de
clagny
i
what
a
coxcomb
said
the
presiding
judge
in
a
whisper
to
his
neighbor
the
he
wants
to
please
madame
de
la
baudraye
replied
the
new
well
then
i
will
read
straight
on
said
lousteau
solemnly
everybody
listened
in
dead
silence
or
roman
revenge
a
deep
groan
answered
rinaldo
s
cry
but
in
his
alarm
he
took
it
for
an
echo
so
weak
and
hollow
was
the
sound
it
could
not
proceed
from
any
human
breast
santa
maria
said
the
voice
if
i
stir
from
this
spot
i
shall
never
find
it
again
thought
naldo
when
he
had
recovered
his
usual
presence
of
mind
if
i
knock
i
shall
be
discovered
what
am
i
to
do
who
is
here
asked
the
voice
hallo
cried
the
brigand
do
the
toads
here
talk
i
am
the
duke
of
bracciano
whoever
you
may
be
if
you
are
not
a
follower
of
the
duchess
in
the
name
of
all
the
saints
come
towards
olympia
i
should
have
to
know
where
to
find
you
monsieur
le
duc
said
naldo
with
the
insolence
of
a
man
who
knows
himself
to
be
necessary
i
can
see
you
my
friend
for
my
eyes
are
accustomed
to
the
darkness
listen
walk
straight
forward
good
now
turn
to
the
left
come
on
this
way
there
we
are
close
to
each
rinaldo
putting
out
his
hands
as
a
precaution
touched
some
iron
bars
i
am
being
deceived
cried
the
bandit
no
you
are
touching
my
cage
or
roman
revenge
sit
down
on
a
broken
shaft
of
phyry
that
is
how
can
the
duke
of
bracciano
be
in
a
cage
asked
the
brigand
my
friend
i
have
been
here
for
thirty
months
standing
up
unable
to
sit
down
but
you
who
are
you
i
am
rinaldo
prince
of
the
pagna
the
chief
of
brave
men
whom
the
law
describes
as
miscreants
whom
all
the
ladies
admire
and
whom
judges
hang
in
obedience
to
an
old
god
be
praised
i
am
saved
an
honest
man
would
have
been
afraid
whereas
i
am
sure
of
coming
to
an
understanding
with
you
cried
the
duke
oh
my
worthy
olympia
deliverer
you
must
be
armed
to
the
most
true
do
you
happen
to
have
yes
files
pincers
di
i
came
to
borrow
the
ures
of
the
bracciani
on
a
long
you
will
earn
a
handsome
share
of
them
very
legitimately
my
good
rinaldo
and
we
may
possibly
go
man
hunting
together
you
surprise
me
eccellenza
listen
to
me
rinaldo
i
will
say
nothing
of
the
craving
for
vengeance
that
gnaws
at
my
heart
i
have
been
here
for
thirty
months
you
too
are
italian
you
will
or
roman
revenge
derstand
me
alas
my
friend
my
fatigue
and
my
horrible
tion
are
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
rage
that
devours
my
soul
the
duchess
of
bracciano
is
still
one
of
the
most
beautiful
women
in
rome
i
loved
her
well
enough
to
be
jealous
you
her
husband
yes
i
was
wrong
no
it
is
not
the
correct
thing
to
be
sure
said
rinaldo
my
jealousy
was
roused
by
the
duchess
conduct
the
duke
went
on
the
event
proved
me
right
a
young
frenchman
fell
in
love
with
olympia
and
she
loved
him
i
had
proofs
of
their
reciprocal
affection
pray
excuse
me
ladies
said
lousteau
but
i
find
it
impossible
to
go
on
without
remarking
to
you
how
direct
this
empire
literature
is
going
to
the
point
without
any
details
a
characteristic
as
it
seems
to
me
of
a
primitive
time
the
literature
of
that
period
holds
a
place
between
the
summaries
of
chapters
in
and
the
categorical
reports
of
a
public
office
it
had
ideas
but
refrained
from
expressing
them
it
was
so
scornful
it
was
observant
but
would
not
communicate
its
observations
to
any
one
it
was
so
miserly
nobody
but
fouche
ever
mentioned
what
he
had
observed
at
that
time
to
quote
the
words
of
one
of
the
most
imbecile
critics
in
the
des
deux
literature
was
content
with
a
clear
sketch
and
the
simple
outline
of
all
antique
statues
it
did
not
dance
over
its
i
should
think
not
it
had
no
periods
to
dance
over
it
had
no
words
to
play
with
you
were
plainly
told
that
lubin
loved
toinette
that
toinette
did
not
love
lubin
that
lubin
killed
toinette
and
the
police
caught
lubin
who
was
put
in
prison
tried
at
the
assizes
and
a
strong
sketch
a
clear
outline
what
a
noble
drama
well
in
these
days
the
barbarians
make
words
like
a
hair
in
a
frost
said
monsieur
de
clagny
so
those
are
the
airs
you
affect
retorted
lousteau
the
rendering
given
above
is
only
intended
to
link
the
various
speeches
into
coherence
it
has
no
resemblance
with
the
french
in
the
original
font
chatoyer
les
et
quelquefois
les
dit
monsieur
de
clagny
ah
lousteau
vous
vous
donnez
de
ces
literally
and
sometimes
the
ah
are
those
the
airs
you
assume
the
play
on
the
insertion
of
the
letter
r

no
meaning
in
english
what
can
he
mean
asked
madame
de
clagny
puzzled
by
this
vile
pun
i
seem
to
be
walking
in
the
dark
replied
the
mayoress
the
jest
would
be
lost
in
an
explanation
remarked
gatien
nowadays
lousteau
went
on
a
novelist
draws
characters
and
instead
of
a
simple
outline
he
unveils
the
human
heart
and
gives
you
some
interest
either
in
lubin
or
in
for
my
part
i
am
alarmed
at
the
progress
of
public
knowledge
in
the
matter
of
literature
said
bianchon
like
the
russians
beaten
by
charles
who
at
least
learned
the
art
of
war
the
reader
has
learned
the
art
of
writing
formerly
all
that
was
expected
of
a
romance
was
that
it
should
be
interesting
as
to
style
no
one
cared
for
that
not
even
the
author
as
to
ideas
zero
as
to
local
color
by
degrees
the
reader
has
demanded
style
interest
pathos
and
complete
information
he
insists
on
the
five
literary
senses
invention
style
thought
learning
and
feeling
then
some
criticism
commenting
on
everything
the
critic
incapable
of
inventing
anything
but
calumny
pronounces
every
work
that
proceeds
from
a
not
perfect
brain
to
be
deformed
some
magicians
as
walter
scott
for
instance
having
appeared
in
the
world
who
combined
all
the
five
literary
senses
such
writers
as
had
but
one
wit
or
learning
style
or
feeling
these
cripples
these
acephalous
maimed
or
purblind
creatures
in
a
literary
sense
have
taken
to
shrieking
that
all
is
lost
and
have
preached
a
crusade
against
men
who
were
spoiling
the
business
or
have
denounced
their
the
history
of
your
last
literary
quarrel
dinah
observed
for
pity
s
sake
come
back
to
the
duke
of
bracciano
cried
monsieur
de
clagny
to
the
despair
of
all
the
company
lousteau
went
on
with
the
sheet
olympia
i
then
wished
to
make
sure
of
my
misfortune
that
i
might
be
avenged
under
the
protection
of
providence
and
the
law
the
duchess
guessed
my
intentions
we
were
at
war
in
our
purposes
before
we
fought
with
poison
in
our
hands
we
tried
to
tempt
each
other
to
such
confidence
as
we
could
not
feel
i
to
induce
her
to
drink
a
potion
she
to
get
sion
of
me
she
was
a
woman
and
she
won
the
day
for
women
have
a
snare
more
than
we
men
i
fell
into
it
i
was
happy
but
i
awoke
next
day
in
this
iron
cage
all
through
the
day
i
bellowed
with
rage
in
the
or
roman
revenge
darkness
of
this
cellar
over
which
is
the
duchess
bedroom
at
night
an
ingenious
counterpoise
acting
as
a
lift
raised
me
through
the
floor
and
i
saw
the
duchess
in
her
lover
s
arms
she
threw
me
a
piece
of
bread
my
daily
pittance
thus
have
i
lived
for
thirty
months
from
this
marble
prison
my
cries
can
reach
no
ear
there
is
no
chance
for
me
i
will
hope
no
more
indeed
the
duchess
room
is
at
the
furthest
end
of
the
palace
and
when
i
am
carried
up
there
none
can
hear
my
voice
each
time
i
see
my
wife
she
shows
me
the
olympia
poison
i
had
prepared
for
her
and
her
lover
i
crave
it
for
myself
but
she
will
not
let
me
die
she
gives
me
bread
and
i
eat
it
i
have
done
well
to
eat
and
live
i
had
not
reckoned
on
robbers
yes
eccellenza
when
those
fools
the
honest
men
are
asleep
we
are
wide
oh
rinaldo
all
i
possess
shall
be
yours
we
will
share
my
treasure
like
brothers
i
would
give
you
everything
even
to
my
duchy
eccellenza
procure
from
the
pope
an
absolution
articulo
it
would
be
of
more
use
to
me
in
my
walk
of
or
roman
revenge
what
you
will
only
file
through
the
bars
of
my
cage
and
lend
me
your
dagger
we
have
but
little
time
quick
quick
oh
if
my
teeth
were
but
files
i
have
tried
to
eat
through
this
eccellenza
said
rinaldo
i
have
already
filed
through
one
you
are
a
god
your
wife
was
at
the
fete
given
by
the
princess
villaviciosa
she
brought
home
her
little
frenchman
she
is
drunk
with
you
have
plenty
of
have
you
done
olympia
your
dagger
said
the
duke
eagerly
to
the
brigand
here
it
good
i
hear
the
clatter
of
the
do
not
forget
me
cried
the
robber
who
knew
what
gratitude
was
no
more
than
my
father
cried
the
duke
said
rinaldo
lord
how
he
flies
up
he
added
to
self
as
the
duke
no
more
than
his
father
if
that
is
all
he
means
to
do
for
and
i
or
roman
revenge
had
sworn
a
vow
never
to
injure
a
woman
but
let
us
leave
the
robber
for
a
moment
to
his
meditations
and
go
up
like
the
duke
to
the
rooms
in
the
palace
another
tailpiece
a
cupid
on
a
snail
and
page
is
blank
said
the
journalist
then
there
are
two
more
blank
pages
before
we
come
to
the
word
it
is
such
a
joy
to
write
when
one
is
unhappily
so
happy
as
to
be
a
novelist
conclusion
never
had
the
duchess
been
more
lovely
she
came
from
her
bath
clothed
like
a
goddess
and
on
seeing
olympia
adolphe
voluptuously
reclining
on
piles
of
cushions
you
are
beautiful
said
she
and
so
are
you
olympia
and
you
still
love
me
more
and
more
said
he
ah
none
but
a
frenchman
knows
how
to
love
cried
the
duchess
do
you
love
me
well
night
then
come
and
with
an
impulse
of
love
and
hate
whether
it
was
that
cardinal
borborigano
had
reminded
her
of
her
husband
or
that
she
felt
wonted
passion
to
display
she
pressed
the
springs
and
held
out
her
arms
that
is
all
said
lousteau
for
the
foreman
has
torn
off
the
rest
in
wrapping
up
my
proofs
but
it
is
enough
to
show
that
the
author
was
full
of
i
can
not
make
head
or
tail
of
it
said
gatien
boirouge
who
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
of
the
party
from
sancerre
nor
i
replied
monsieur
gravier
and
yet
it
is
a
novel
of
the
time
of
the
empire
said
lousteau
by
the
way
in
which
the
brigand
is
made
to
speak
said
monsieur
gravier
it
is
evident
that
the
author
knew
nothing
of
italy
banditti
do
not
allow
themselves
such
graceful
madame
gorju
came
up
to
bianchon
seeing
him
pensive
and
with
a
glance
towards
her
daughter
mademoiselle
euphemie
gorju
the
owner
of
a
fairly
good
fortune
what
a
rhodomontade
said
she
the
prescriptions
you
write
are
worth
more
than
all
that
the
mayoress
had
elaborately
worked
up
this
speech
which
in
her
opinion
showed
strong
judgment
well
madame
we
must
be
lenient
we
have
but
twenty
pages
out
of
a
thousand
said
bianchon
looking
at
mademoiselle
gorju
whose
figure
threatened
terrible
things
after
the
birth
of
her
first
child
well
monsieur
de
clagny
said
lousteau
we
were
talking
yesterday
of
the
forms
of
revenge
invented
by
husbands
what
do
you
say
to
those
invented
by
wives
i
say
replied
the
public
prosecutor
that
the
romance
is
not
by
a
councillor
of
state
but
by
a
woman
for
extravagant
inventions
the
imagination
of
women
far
outdoes
that
of
men
witness
by
shelley
by
george
sand
the
works
of
anne
radcliffe
and
the
new
prometheus
of
camille
de
dinah
looked
steadily
at
monsieur
de
clagny
making
him
feel
by
an
expression
that
gave
him
a
chill
that
in
spite
of
the
illustrious
examples
he
had
quoted
she
regarded
this
as
a
reflection
on
la
pooh
said
little
baudraye
the
duke
of
bracciano
whom
his
wife
puts
into
a
cage
and
to
whom
she
shows
herself
every
night
in
the
arms
of
her
lover
will
kill
her
and
do
you
call
that
revenge
our
laws
and
our
society
are
far
more
why
little
la
baudraye
is
talking
said
monsieur
boirouge
to
his
wife
why
the
woman
is
left
to
live
on
a
small
allowance
the
world
turns
its
back
on
her
she
has
no
more
finery
and
no
respect
paid
her
the
two
things
which
in
my
opinion
are
the
of
woman
said
the
little
old
man
but
she
has
happiness
said
madame
de
la
baudraye
sententiously
no
said
the
master
of
the
house
lighting
his
candle
to
go
to
bed
for
she
has
a
for
a
man
who
thinks
of
nothing
but
his
and
poles
he
has
some
spunk
said
lousteau
well
he
must
have
something
replied
bianchon
madame
de
la
baudraye
the
only
person
who
could
hear
bianchon
s
remark
laughed
so
knowingly
and
at
the
same
time
so
bitterly
that
the
physician
could
guess
the
mystery
of
this
woman
s
life
her
premature
wrinkles
had
been
puzzling
him
all
day
but
dinah
did
not
guess
on
her
part
the
ominous
prophecy
contained
for
her
in
her
husband
s
little
speech
which
her
kind
old
abbe
duret
if
he
had
been
alive
would
not
have
failed
to
elucidate
little
la
baudraye
had
detected
in
dinah
s
eyes
when
she
glanced
at
the
journalist
returning
the
ball
of
his
jests
that
swift
and
luminous
flash
of
tenderness
which
gilds
the
gleam
of
a
woman
s
eye
when
prudence
is
cast
to
the
winds
and
she
is
fairly
carried
away
dinah
paid
no
more
heed
to
her
husband
s
hint
to
her
to
observe
the
proprieties
than
lousteau
had
done
to
dinah
s
significant
warnings
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
any
other
man
than
bianchon
would
have
been
surprised
at
lousteau
s
immediate
success
but
he
was
so
much
the
doctor
that
he
was
not
even
nettled
at
dinah
s
marked
preference
for
the
than
the
in
fact
dinah
herself
famous
was
naturally
more
alive
to
wit
than
to
fame
love
generally
prefers
contrast
to
similitude
everything
was
against
the
physician
his
frankness
his
simplicity
and
his
profession
and
this
is
why
women
who
want
to
love
and
dinah
wanted
to
love
as
much
as
to
be
loved
have
an
instinctive
aversion
for
men
who
are
devoted
to
an
absorbing
occupation
in
spite
of
superiority
they
are
all
women
in
the
matter
of
encroachment
lousteau
a
poet
and
journalist
and
a
libertine
with
a
veneer
of
misanthropy
had
that
tinsel
of
the
intellect
and
led
the
life
that
attracts
women
the
blunt
good
sense
and
keen
insight
of
the
really
great
man
weighed
upon
dinah
who
would
not
confess
her
own
smallness
even
to
herself
she
said
in
her
mind
the
doctor
is
perhaps
the
better
man
but
i
do
not
like
then
again
she
reflected
on
his
professional
duties
wondering
whether
a
woman
could
ever
be
anything
but
a
to
a
medical
man
who
saw
so
many
subjects
in
the
course
of
a
day
s
work
the
first
sentence
of
the
aphorism
written
by
bianchon
in
her
album
was
a
medical
observation
striking
so
directly
at
woman
that
dinah
could
not
fail
to
be
hit
by
it
and
then
bianchon
was
leaving
on
the
morrow
his
practice
required
his
return
what
woman
short
of
having
cupid
s
mythological
dart
in
her
heart
could
decide
in
so
short
a
time
these
little
things
which
lead
to
such
great
catastrophes
having
been
seen
in
a
mass
by
bianchon
he
pronounced
the
verdict
he
had
come
to
as
to
madame
de
la
baudraye
in
a
few
words
to
lousteau
to
the
journalist
s
great
amazement
while
the
two
friends
stood
talking
together
a
storm
was
gathering
in
the
sancerre
circle
who
could
not
in
the
least
understand
lousteau
s
paraphrases
and
commentaries
and
who
vented
it
on
their
hostess
far
from
finding
in
his
talk
the
romance
which
the
public
prosecutor
the
the
presiding
judge
and
his
deputy
lebas
had
discovered
there
to
say
nothing
of
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
and
dinah
the
ladies
now
gathered
round
the
took
the
matter
as
a
practical
joke
and
accused
the
muse
of
sancerre
of
having
a
finger
in
it
they
had
all
looked
forward
to
a
delightful
evening
and
had
all
strained
in
vain
every
faculty
of
their
mind
nothing
makes
provincial
folks
so
angry
as
the
notion
of
having
been
a
for
paris
folks
madame
piedefer
left
the
table
to
say
to
her
daughter
do
go
and
talk
to
the
ladies
they
are
quite
annoyed
by
your
lousteau
could
not
fail
to
see
dinah
s
great
superiority
over
the
best
women
of
sancerre
she
was
better
dressed
her
movements
were
graceful
her
complexion
was
exquisitely
white
by
candlelight
in
short
she
stood
out
against
this
background
of
old
faces
shy
and
girls
like
a
queen
in
the
midst
of
her
court
visions
of
paris
faded
from
his
brain
lousteau
was
accepting
the
provincial
surroundings
and
while
he
had
too
much
imagination
to
remain
unimpressed
by
the
royal
splendor
of
this
chateau
the
beautiful
carvings
and
the
antique
beauty
of
the
rooms
he
had
also
too
much
experience
to
overlook
the
value
of
the
personality
which
completed
this
gem
of
the
renaissance
so
by
the
time
the
visitors
from
sancerre
had
taken
their
leave
one
by
one
for
they
had
an
hour
s
drive
before
them
when
no
one
remained
in
the
but
monsieur
de
clagny
monsieur
lebas
gatien
and
monsieur
gravier
who
were
all
to
sleep
at
anzy
the
journalist
had
already
changed
his
mind
about
dinah
his
opinion
had
gone
through
the
evolution
that
madame
de
la
baudraye
had
so
audaciously
prophesied
at
their
first
meeting
ah
what
things
they
will
say
about
us
on
the
drive
home
cried
the
mistress
of
the
house
as
she
returned
to
the
after
seeing
the
president
and
the
presidente
to
their
carriage
with
madame
and
mademoiselle
the
rest
of
the
evening
had
its
pleasant
side
in
the
intimacy
of
a
small
party
each
one
brought
to
the
conversation
his
contribution
of
epigrams
on
the
figure
the
visitors
from
sancerre
had
cut
during
lousteau
s
comments
on
the
paper
wrapped
round
the
proofs
my
dear
fellow
said
bianchon
to
lousteau
as
they
went
to
bed
they
had
an
enormous
room
with
two
beds
in
it
you
will
be
the
happy
man
of
this
woman
s
choice
piedefer
do
you
think
so
it
is
quite
natural
you
are
supposed
here
to
have
had
many
mistresses
in
paris
and
to
a
woman
there
is
something
indescribably
inviting
in
a
man
whom
other
women
favor
something
attractive
and
fascinating
is
it
that
she
prides
herself
on
being
longer
remembered
than
all
the
rest
that
she
appeals
to
his
experience
as
a
sick
man
will
pay
more
to
a
famous
physician
or
that
she
is
flattered
by
the
revival
of
a
heart
vanity
and
the
senses
count
for
so
much
in
love
affairs
said
lousteau
that
there
may
be
some
truth
in
all
those
hypotheses
however
if
i
remain
it
will
be
in
consequence
of
the
certificate
of
innocence
without
ignorance
that
you
have
given
dinah
she
is
handsome
is
she
not
love
will
make
her
beautiful
said
the
doctor
and
after
all
she
will
be
a
rich
widow
some
day
or
other
and
a
child
would
secure
her
the
in
the
master
of
la
baudraye
s
fortune
why
it
is
quite
an
act
of
virtue
to
make
love
to
her
said
lousteau
rolling
himself
up
in
the
and
with
your
help
yes
i
well
on
the
following
day
madame
de
la
baudraye
to
whom
her
husband
had
six
months
since
given
a
pair
of
horses
which
he
also
used
in
the
fields
and
an
old
carriage
that
rattled
on
the
road
decided
that
she
would
take
bianchon
so
far
on
his
way
as
cosne
where
he
would
get
into
the
lyons
diligence
as
it
passed
through
she
also
took
her
mother
and
lousteau
but
she
intended
to
drop
her
mother
at
la
baudraye
to
go
on
to
cosne
with
the
two
parisians
and
return
alone
with
etienne
she
was
elegantly
dressed
as
the
journalist
at
once
perceived
bronze
kid
boots
gray
silk
stockings
a
muslin
dress
a
green
silk
scarf
with
shaded
fringe
at
the
ends
and
a
pretty
black
lace
bonnet
with
flowers
in
it
as
to
lousteau
the
wretch
had
assumed
his
patent
leather
boots
trousers
of
english
kerseymere
with
pleats
in
front
a
very
open
waistcoat
showing
a
particularly
fine
shirt
and
the
black
brocade
waterfall
of
his
handsome
cravat
and
a
very
thin
very
short
black
monsieur
de
clagny
and
monsieur
gravier
looked
at
each
other
feeling
rather
silly
as
they
beheld
the
two
parisians
in
the
carriage
while
they
like
two
simpletons
were
left
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
who
stood
at
the
top
waving
his
little
hand
in
a
little
farewell
to
the
doctor
could
not
forbear
from
smiling
as
he
heard
monsieur
de
clagny
say
to
monsieur
gravier
you
should
have
escorted
them
on
at
this
juncture
gatien
riding
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
s
quiet
little
mare
came
out
of
the
side
road
from
the
stables
and
joined
the
party
in
the
chaise
ah
good
said
the
the
boy
has
mounted
what
a
bore
cried
dinah
as
she
saw
gatien
in
thirteen
years
for
i
have
been
married
nearly
thirteen
years
i
have
never
had
three
hours
liberty
married
madame
said
the
journalist
with
a
smile
you
remind
me
of
a
saying
of
michaud
s
he
was
so
witty
he
was
setting
out
for
the
holy
land
and
his
friends
were
remonstrating
with
him
urging
his
age
and
the
perils
of
such
an
expedition
and
then
said
one
you
are
married
said
he
so
little
even
the
rigid
madame
piedefer
could
not
repress
a
smile
i
should
not
be
surprised
to
see
monsieur
de
clagny
mounted
on
my
pony
to
complete
the
escort
said
dinah
well
if
the
public
prosecutor
does
not
pursue
us
you
can
get
rid
of
this
little
fellow
at
sancerre
bianchon
must
of
course
have
left
something
behind
on
his
table
the
notes
for
the
first
lecture
of
his
course
and
you
can
ask
gatien
to
go
back
to
anzy
to
fetch
this
simple
little
plot
put
madame
de
la
baudraye
into
high
spirits
from
the
road
between
anzy
to
sancerre
a
glorious
landscape
frequently
comes
into
view
of
the
noble
stretches
of
the
loire
looking
like
a
lake
and
it
was
got
over
very
pleasantly
for
dinah
was
happy
in
finding
herself
well
understood
love
was
discussed
in
theory
a
subject
allowing
lovers
to
take
the
measure
as
it
were
of
each
other
s
heart
the
journalist
took
a
tone
of
refined
corruption
to
prove
that
love
obeys
no
law
that
the
character
of
the
lovers
gives
infinite
variety
to
its
incidents
that
the
circumstances
of
social
life
add
to
the
multiplicity
of
its
manifestations
that
in
love
all
is
possible
and
true
and
that
any
given
woman
after
resisting
every
temptation
and
the
seductions
of
the
most
passionate
lover
may
be
carried
off
her
feet
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
by
a
fancy
an
internal
whirlwind
of
which
god
alone
would
ever
know
the
secret
why
said
he
is
not
that
the
key
to
all
the
adventures
we
have
talked
over
these
three
days
past
for
these
three
days
indeed
dinah
s
lively
imagination
had
been
full
of
the
most
insidious
romances
and
the
conversation
of
the
two
parisians
had
affected
the
woman
as
the
most
mischievous
reading
might
have
done
lousteau
watched
the
effects
of
this
clever
manoeuvre
to
seize
the
moment
when
his
prey
whose
readiness
to
be
caught
was
hidden
under
the
abstraction
caused
by
irresolution
should
be
quite
dizzy
dinah
wished
to
show
la
baudraye
to
her
two
visitors
and
the
farce
was
duly
played
out
of
remembering
the
papers
left
by
bianchon
in
his
room
at
anzy
gatien
flew
off
at
a
gallop
to
obey
his
sovereign
madame
piedefer
went
to
do
some
shopping
in
sancerre
and
dinah
went
on
to
cosne
alone
with
the
two
friends
lousteau
took
his
seat
by
the
lady
bianchon
riding
backwards
the
two
friends
talked
affectionately
and
with
deep
compassion
for
the
fate
of
this
choice
nature
so
ill
understood
and
in
the
midst
of
such
vulgar
surroundings
bianchon
served
lousteau
well
by
making
fun
of
the
public
prosecutor
of
monsieur
gravier
and
of
gatien
there
was
a
tone
of
such
genuine
contempt
in
his
remarks
that
madame
de
la
baudraye
dared
not
take
the
part
of
her
adorers
i
perfectly
understand
the
position
you
have
maintained
said
the
doctor
as
they
crossed
the
loire
you
were
inaccessible
excepting
to
that
which
often
leads
to
and
not
one
of
those
men
it
is
very
certain
is
capable
of
disguising
what
at
an
early
stage
of
life
is
disgusting
to
the
senses
in
the
eyes
of
a
refined
woman
to
you
now
love
is
indispensable
cried
dinah
looking
curiously
at
the
doctor
do
you
mean
that
you
prescribe
love
to
me
if
you
go
on
living
as
you
live
now
in
three
years
you
will
be
hideous
replied
bianchon
in
a
dictatorial
tone
monsieur
said
madame
de
la
baudraye
almost
frightened
forgive
my
friend
said
lousteau
half
jestingly
he
is
always
the
medical
man
and
to
him
love
is
merely
a
question
of
hygiene
but
he
is
quite
disinterested
it
is
for
your
sake
only
that
he
speaks
as
is
evident
since
he
is
starting
in
an
hour
at
cosne
a
little
crowd
gathered
round
the
old
repainted
chaise
with
the
arms
on
the
panels
granted
by
louis
xiv
to
the
new
la
baudraye
gules
a
pair
of
scales
or
on
a
chief
azure
color
on
color
three
argent
for
supporters
two
greyhounds
argent
collared
azure
chained
or
the
ironical
motto
sic
patet
fides

had
been
inflicted
on
the
converted
calvinist
by
hozier
the
satirical
let
us
get
out
they
will
come
and
find
us
said
the
baroness
desiring
her
coachman
to
keep
watch
dinah
took
bianchon
s
arm
and
the
doctor
set
off
by
the
banks
of
the
loire
at
so
rapid
a
pace
that
the
journalist
had
to
linger
behind
the
physician
had
explained
by
a
single
wink
that
he
meant
to
do
lousteau
a
good
turn
you
have
been
attracted
by
etienne
said
bianchon
to
dinah
he
has
appealed
strongly
to
your
imagination
last
night
we
were
talking
about
he
loves
you
but
he
is
frivolous
and
difficult
to
hold
his
poverty
compels
him
to
live
in
paris
while
everything
condemns
you
to
live
at
take
a
lofty
view
of
life
make
lousteau
your
friend
do
not
ask
too
much
of
him
he
will
come
three
times
a
year
to
spend
a
few
days
with
you
and
you
will
owe
to
him
your
beauty
happiness
and
fortune
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
may
live
to
be
a
hundred
but
he
might
die
in
a
few
days
if
he
should
leave
off
the
flannel
in
which
he
swathes
himself
so
run
no
risks
be
prudent
both
of
say
not
a
work
i
have
read
your
madame
de
la
baudraye
was
defenceless
under
this
serried
attack
and
in
the
presence
of
a
man
who
spoke
at
once
as
a
doctor
a
confessor
and
confidential
friend
indeed
said
she
can
you
suppose
that
any
woman
would
care
to
compete
with
a
journalist
s
mistresses
monsieur
lousteau
strikes
me
as
agreeable
and
witty
but
he
is
dinah
had
turned
back
and
was
obliged
to
check
the
flow
of
words
by
which
she
tried
to
disguise
her
intentions
for
etienne
who
seemed
to
be
studying
progress
in
cosne
was
coming
to
meet
them
believe
me
said
bianchon
what
he
wants
is
to
be
truly
loved
and
if
he
alters
his
course
of
life
it
will
be
to
the
benefit
of
his
dinah
s
coachman
hurried
up
breathlessly
to
say
that
the
diligence
had
come
in
and
they
walked
on
quickly
madame
de
la
baudraye
between
the
two
men
my
children
said
bianchon
before
they
got
into
the
town
you
have
my
blessing
he
released
madame
de
la
baudraye
s
hand
from
his
arm
and
allowed
lousteau
to
draw
it
into
his
with
a
tender
look
as
he
pressed
it
to
his
heart
what
a
difference
to
dinah
etienne
s
arm
thrilled
her
deeply
bianchon
s
had
not
stirred
her
in
the
least
she
and
the
journalist
exchanged
one
of
those
glowing
looks
that
are
more
than
an
avowal
only
provincial
women
wear
muslin
gowns
in
these
days
thought
lousteau
to
himself
the
only
stuff
which
shows
every
crease
this
woman
who
has
chosen
me
for
her
lover
will
make
a
fuss
over
her
frock
if
she
had
but
put
on
a
foulard
skirt
i
should
be
what
is
the
meaning
of
these
difficulties
while
lousteau
was
wondering
whether
dinah
had
put
on
a
muslin
gown
on
purpose
to
protect
herself
by
an
insuperable
obstacle
bianchon
with
the
help
of
the
coachman
was
seeing
his
luggage
piled
on
the
diligence
finally
he
came
to
take
leave
of
dinah
who
was
excessively
friendly
with
him
go
home
madame
la
baronne
leave
me
here
gatien
will
be
coming
he
added
in
an
undertone
it
is
getting
late
said
he
aloud
great
man
cried
lousteau
shaking
hands
with
bianchon
when
the
journalist
and
madame
de
la
baudraye
side
by
side
in
the
rickety
old
chaise
had
recrossed
the
loire
they
both
were
unready
to
speak
in
these
circumstances
the
first
words
that
break
the
silence
are
full
of
terrible
meaning
do
you
know
how
much
i
love
you
said
the
journalist
point
blank
victory
might
gratify
lousteau
but
defeat
could
cause
him
no
grief
this
indifference
was
the
secret
of
his
audacity
he
took
madame
de
la
baudraye
s
hand
as
he
spoke
these
decisive
words
and
pressed
it
in
both
his
but
dinah
gently
released
it
yes
i
am
as
good
as
an
actress
or
a
she
said
in
a
voice
that
trembled
though
she
spoke
lightly
but
can
you
suppose
that
a
woman
who
in
spite
of
her
absurdities
has
some
intelligence
will
have
reserved
the
best
treasures
of
her
heart
for
a
man
who
will
regard
her
merely
as
a
transient
pleasure
i
am
not
surprised
to
hear
from
your
lips
the
words
which
so
many
men
have
said
to
me
but
the
coachman
turned
round
here
comes
monsieur
gatien
said
he
i
love
you
i
will
have
you
you
shall
be
mine
for
i
have
never
felt
for
any
woman
the
passion
i
have
for
you
said
lousteau
in
her
ear
in
spite
of
my
will
perhaps
said
she
with
a
smile
at
least
you
must
seem
to
have
been
assaulted
to
save
my
honor
said
the
parisian
to
whom
the
fatal
immaculateness
of
clean
muslin
suggested
a
ridiculous
notion
before
gatien
had
reached
the
end
of
the
bridge
the
outrageous
journalist
had
crumpled
up
madame
de
la
baudraye
s
muslin
dress
to
such
an
effect
that
she
was
absolutely
not
presentable
oh
monsieur
she
exclaimed
in
dignified
reproof
you
defied
me
said
the
parisian
but
gatien
now
rode
up
with
the
vehemence
of
a
duped
lover
to
regain
a
little
of
madame
de
la
baudraye
s
esteem
lousteau
did
his
best
to
hide
the
tumbled
dress
from
gatien
s
eyes
by
leaning
out
of
the
chaise
to
speak
to
him
from
dinah
s
side
go
back
to
our
inn
said
he
there
is
still
time
the
diligence
does
not
start
for
half
an
hour
the
papers
are
on
the
table
of
the
room
bianchon
was
in
he
wants
them
particularly
for
he
will
be
lost
without
his
notes
for
the
pray
go
gatien
said
dinah
to
her
young
adorer
with
an
imperious
glance
and
the
boy
thus
commanded
turned
his
horse
and
was
off
with
a
loose
rein
go
quickly
to
la
baudraye
cried
lousteau
to
the
coachman
madame
is
not
well
your
mother
only
will
know
the
secret
of
my
trick
added
he
taking
his
seat
by
dinah
you
call
such
infamous
conduct
a
trick
cried
madame
de
la
baudraye
swallowing
down
a
few
tears
that
dried
up
with
the
fire
of
outraged
pride
she
leaned
back
in
the
corner
of
the
chaise
crossed
her
arms
and
gazed
out
at
the
loire
and
the
landscape
at
anything
rather
than
at
lousteau
the
journalist
put
on
his
most
ingratiating
tone
and
talked
till
they
reached
la
baudraye
where
dinah
fled
indoors
trying
not
to
be
seen
by
any
one
in
her
agitation
she
threw
herself
on
a
sofa
and
burst
into
tears
if
i
am
an
object
of
horror
to
you
of
aversion
or
scorn
i
will
go
said
lousteau
who
had
followed
her
and
he
threw
himself
at
her
feet
it
was
at
this
crisis
that
madame
piedefer
came
in
saying
to
her
daughter
what
is
the
matter
what
has
happened
give
your
daughter
another
dress
at
once
said
the
audacious
parisian
in
the
prim
old
lady
s
ear
hearing
the
mad
gallop
of
gatien
s
horse
madame
de
la
baudraye
fled
to
her
bedroom
followed
by
her
mother
there
are
no
papers
at
the
inn
said
gatien
to
lousteau
who
went
out
to
meet
him
and
you
found
none
at
the
chateau
d
anzy
either
replied
lousteau
you
have
been
making
a
fool
of
me
said
gatien
in
a
cold
set
voice
quite
so
replied
lousteau
madame
de
la
baudraye
was
greatly
annoyed
by
your
choosing
to
follow
her
without
being
invited
believe
me
to
bore
a
woman
is
a
bad
way
of
courting
her
dinah
has
played
you
a
trick
and
you
have
given
her
a
laugh
it
is
more
than
any
of
you
has
done
in
these
thirteen
years
past
you
owe
that
success
to
bianchon
for
your
cousin
was
the
author
of
the
farce
of
the
will
the
horse
get
over
it
asked
lousteau
with
a
laugh
while
gatien
was
wondering
whether
to
be
angry
or
not
the
horse
said
gatien
at
this
moment
madame
de
la
baudraye
came
in
dressed
in
a
velvet
gown
and
accompanied
by
her
mother
who
shot
angry
flashes
at
lousteau
it
would
have
been
too
rash
for
dinah
to
seem
cold
or
severe
to
lousteau
in
gatien
s
presence
and
etienne
taking
advantage
of
this
offered
his
arm
to
the
supposed
lucretia
however
she
declined
it
do
you
mean
to
cast
off
a
man
who
has
vowed
to
live
for
you
said
he
walking
close
beside
her
i
shall
stop
at
sancerre
and
go
home
are
you
coming
mamma
said
madame
de
la
baudraye
to
madame
piedefer
thus
avoiding
a
reply
to
the
direct
challenge
by
which
lousteau
was
forcing
her
to
a
decision
lousteau
handed
the
mother
into
the
chaise
he
helped
madame
de
la
baudraye
by
gently
taking
her
arm
and
he
and
gatien
took
the
front
seat
leaving
the
saddle
horse
at
la
baudraye
you
have
changed
your
gown
said
gatien
blunderingly
to
dinah
madame
la
baronne
was
chilled
by
the
cool
air
off
the
river
replied
lousteau
bianchon
advised
her
to
put
on
a
warm
dinah
turned
as
red
as
a
poppy
and
madame
piedefer
assumed
a
stern
expression
poor
bianchon
he
is
on
the
road
to
paris
a
noble
soul
said
lousteau
oh
yes
cried
madame
de
la
baudraye
he
is
full
of
delicate
feeling
we
were
in
such
good
spirits
when
we
set
out
said
lousteau
now
you
are
overdone
and
you
speak
to
me
so
bitterly
why
are
you
not
accustomed
to
being
told
how
handsome
and
how
clever
you
are
for
my
part
i
say
boldly
before
gatien
i
give
up
paris
i
mean
to
stay
at
sancerre
and
swell
the
number
of
your
i
feel
so
young
again
in
my
native
district
i
have
quite
forgotten
paris
and
all
its
wickedness
and
its
bores
and
its
wearisome
yes
my
life
seems
in
a
way
dinah
allowed
lousteau
to
talk
without
even
looking
at
him
but
at
last
there
was
a
moment
when
this
serpent
s
rhodomontade
was
really
so
inspired
by
the
effort
he
made
to
affect
passion
in
phrases
and
ideas
of
which
the
meaning
though
hidden
from
gatien
found
a
loud
response
in
dinah
s
heart
that
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
this
look
seemed
to
crown
lousteau
s
joy
his
wit
flowed
more
freely
and
at
last
he
made
madame
de
la
baudraye
laugh
when
under
circumstances
which
so
seriously
compromise
her
pride
a
woman
has
been
made
to
laugh
she
is
finally
committed
as
they
drove
in
by
the
spacious
graveled
forecourt
with
its
lawn
in
the
middle
and
the
large
vases
filled
with
flowers
which
so
well
set
off
the
facade
of
anzy
the
journalist
was
saying
when
women
love
they
forgive
everything
even
our
crimes
when
they
do
not
love
they
can
not
forgive
anything
not
even
our
do
you
forgive
me
he
added
in
madame
de
la
baudraye
s
ear
and
pressing
her
arm
to
his
heart
with
tender
emphasis
and
dinah
could
not
help
smiling
all
through
dinner
and
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
etienne
was
in
the
most
delightful
spirits
inexhaustibly
cheerful
but
while
thus
giving
vent
to
his
intoxication
he
now
and
then
fell
into
the
dreamy
abstraction
of
a
man
who
seems
rapt
in
his
own
happiness
after
coffee
had
been
served
madame
de
la
baudraye
and
her
mother
left
the
men
to
wander
about
the
gardens
monsieur
gravier
then
remarked
to
monsieur
de
clagny
did
you
observe
that
madame
de
la
baudraye
after
going
out
in
a
muslin
gown
came
home
in
a
velvet
as
she
got
into
the
carriage
at
cosne
the
muslin
dress
caught
on
a
brass
nail
and
was
torn
all
the
way
down
replied
lousteau
oh
exclaimed
gatien
stricken
to
the
heart
by
hearing
two
such
different
explanations
the
journalist
who
understood
took
gatien
by
the
arm
and
pressed
it
as
a
hint
to
him
to
be
silent
a
few
minutes
later
etienne
left
dinah
s
three
adorers
and
took
possession
of
little
la
baudraye
then
gatien
was
as
to
the
events
of
the
day
monsieur
gravier
and
monsieur
de
clagny
were
dismayed
to
hear
that
on
the
return
from
cosne
lousteau
had
been
alone
with
dinah
and
even
more
so
on
hearing
the
two
versions
explaining
the
lady
s
change
of
dress
and
the
three
discomfited
gentlemen
were
in
a
very
awkward
position
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
next
day
each
on
various
business
was
obliged
to
leave
anzy
dinah
remained
with
her
mother
lousteau
and
her
husband
the
annoyance
vented
by
the
three
victims
gave
rise
to
an
organized
rebellion
in
sancerre
the
surrender
of
the
muse
of
le
berry
of
the
nivernais
and
of
morvan
was
the
cause
of
a
perfect
hue
and
cry
of
slander
evil
report
and
various
guesses
in
which
the
story
of
the
muslin
gown
held
a
prominent
place
no
dress
dinah
had
ever
worn
had
been
so
much
commented
on
or
was
half
as
interesting
to
the
girls
who
could
not
conceive
what
the
connection
might
be
that
made
the
married
women
laugh
between
love
and
a
muslin
gown
the
presidente
boirouge
furious
at
her
son
s
discomfiture
forgot
the
praise
she
had
lavished
on
the
poem
of
and
fulminated
terrific
condemnation
on
the
woman
who
could
publish
such
a
disgraceful
work
the
wretched
woman
commits
every
crime
she
writes
about
said
she
perhaps
she
will
come
to
the
same
end
as
her
heroine
dinah
s
fate
among
the
good
folks
of
sancerre
was
like
that
of
marechal
soult
in
the
opposition
newspapers
as
long
as
he
is
minister
he
lost
the
battle
of
toulouse
whenever
he
is
out
of
the
government
he
won
it
while
she
was
virtuous
dinah
was
a
match
for
camille
de
maupin
a
rival
of
the
most
famous
women
but
as
soon
as
she
was
happy
she
was
an
monsieur
de
clagny
was
her
valiant
champion
he
went
several
times
to
the
chateau
d
anzy
to
acquire
the
right
to
contradict
the
rumors
current
as
to
the
woman
he
still
faithfully
adored
even
in
her
fall
and
he
maintained
that
she
and
lousteau
were
engaged
together
on
some
great
work
but
the
lawyer
was
laughed
to
scorn
the
month
of
october
was
lovely
autumn
is
the
finest
season
in
the
valley
of
the
loire
but
in
it
was
unusually
glorious
nature
seemed
to
aid
and
abet
dinah
who
as
bianchon
had
predicted
gradually
developed
a
passion
in
one
month
she
was
an
altered
woman
she
was
surprised
to
find
in
herself
so
many
inert
and
dormant
qualities
hitherto
in
abeyance
to
her
lousteau
seemed
an
angel
for
the
crowning
need
of
a
great
nature
had
made
a
new
woman
of
her
dinah
was
alive
she
had
found
an
outlet
for
her
powers
she
saw
vistas
in
the
future
in
short
she
was
happy
happy
without
alarms
or
hindrances
the
vast
castle
the
gardens
the
park
the
forest
favored
love
lousteau
found
in
madame
de
la
baudraye
an
artlessness
nay
if
you
will
an
innocence
of
mind
which
made
her
very
original
there
was
much
more
of
the
unexpected
and
winning
in
her
than
in
a
girl
lousteau
was
quite
alive
to
a
form
of
flattery
which
in
most
women
is
assumed
but
which
in
dinah
was
genuine
she
really
learned
from
him
the
ways
of
love
he
really
was
the
first
to
reign
in
her
heart
and
indeed
he
took
the
trouble
to
be
exceedingly
amiable
men
like
women
have
a
stock
in
hand
of
recitatives
of
of
airs
and
refrains
shall
we
say
of
recipes
although
we
speak
of
love
which
each
one
believes
to
be
exclusively
his
own
men
who
have
reached
lousteau
s
age
try
to
distribute
the
movements
of
this
repertoire
through
the
whole
opera
of
a
passion
lousteau
regarding
this
adventure
with
dinah
as
a
mere
temporary
connection
was
eager
to
stamp
himself
on
her
memory
in
indelible
lines
and
during
that
beautiful
october
he
was
prodigal
of
his
most
entrancing
melodies
and
most
elaborate
in
fact
he
exhausted
every
resource
of
the
stage
management
of
love
to
use
an
expression
borrowed
from
the
theatrical
dictionary
and
admirably
descriptive
of
his
manoeuvres
if
that
woman
ever
forgets
me
he
would
sometimes
say
to
himself
as
they
returned
together
from
a
long
walk
in
the
woods
i
will
owe
her
no
grudge
she
will
have
found
something
when
two
beings
have
sung
together
all
the
duets
of
that
enchanting
score
and
still
love
each
other
it
may
be
said
that
they
love
truly
lousteau
however
had
not
time
to
repeat
himself
for
he
was
to
leave
anzy
in
the
early
days
of
november
his
paper
required
his
presence
in
paris
before
breakfast
on
the
day
before
he
was
to
leave
the
journalist
and
dinah
saw
the
master
of
the
house
come
in
with
an
artist
from
nevers
who
restored
carvings
of
all
kinds
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
lousteau
what
is
to
be
done
to
the
chateau
this
is
what
i
am
going
to
do
said
the
little
man
leading
lousteau
the
local
artist
and
dinah
out
on
the
terrace
he
pointed
out
on
the
front
of
the
building
a
shield
supported
by
two
sirens
not
unlike
that
which
may
be
seen
on
the
arcade
now
closed
through
which
there
used
to
be
a
passage
from
the
quai
des
tuileries
to
the
courtyard
of
the
old
louvre
and
over
which
the
words
may
still
be
seen
du
cabinet
du
this
shield
bore
the
arms
of
the
noble
house
of
uxelles
namely
or
and
gules
party
per
fess
with
two
lions
or
dexter
and
sinister
as
supporters
above
a
knight
s
helm
mantled
of
the
tincture
of
the
shield
and
surmounted
by
a
ducal
coronet
motto
paroist
a
proud
and
sonorous
device
i
want
to
put
my
own
coat
of
arms
in
the
place
of
that
of
the
uxelles
and
as
they
are
repeated
six
times
on
the
two
fronts
and
the
two
wings
it
is
not
a
trifling
your
arms
so
new
and
since
exclaimed
dinah
have
i
not
created
an
entail
i
could
understand
it
if
you
had
children
said
the
journalist
oh
said
the
old
man
madame
de
la
baudraye
is
still
young
there
is
no
time
this
allusion
made
lousteau
smile
he
did
not
understand
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
there
didine
said
he
in
dinah
s
ear
what
a
waste
of
remorse
dinah
begged
him
to
give
her
one
day
more
and
the
lovers
parted
after
the
manner
of
certain
theatres
which
give
ten
last
performances
of
a
piece
that
is
paying
and
how
many
promises
they
made
how
many
solemn
pledges
did
not
dinah
exact
and
the
unblushing
journalist
give
her
dinah
with
superiority
of
the
superior
woman
accompanied
lousteau
in
the
face
of
all
the
world
as
far
as
cosne
with
her
mother
and
little
la
baudraye
when
ten
days
later
madame
de
la
baudraye
saw
in
her
at
la
baudraye
monsieur
de
clagny
gatien
and
gravier
she
found
an
opportunity
of
saying
to
each
in
turn
i
owe
it
to
monsieur
lousteau
that
i
discovered
that
i
had
not
been
loved
for
my
own
and
what
noble
speeches
she
uttered
on
man
on
the
nature
of
his
feelings
on
the
end
of
his
base
passions
and
so
forth
of
dinah
s
three
worshipers
monsieur
de
clagny
only
said
to
her
i
love
you
come
what
may
and
dinah
accepted
him
as
her
confidant
lavished
on
him
all
the
marks
of
friendship
which
women
can
devise
for
the
gurths
who
are
ready
thus
to
wear
the
collar
of
gilded
slavery
in
paris
once
more
lousteau
had
in
a
few
weeks
lost
the
impression
of
the
happy
time
he
had
spent
at
the
chateau
d
anzy
this
is
why
lousteau
lived
by
his
pen
in
this
century
especially
since
the
triumph
of
the
the
commonplace
citizen
who
takes
good
care
not
to
imitate
francis
or
louis
to
live
by
the
pen
is
a
form
of
penal
servitude
to
which
a
would
prefer
death
to
live
by
the
pen
means
to
create
to
create
and
and
incessantly
or
to
seem
to
create
and
the
imitation
costs
as
dear
as
the
reality
so
besides
his
daily
contribution
to
a
newspaper
which
was
like
the
stone
of
sisyphus
and
which
came
every
monday
crashing
down
on
to
the
feather
of
his
pen
etienne
worked
for
three
or
four
literary
magazines
still
do
not
be
alarmed
he
put
no
artistic
conscientiousness
into
his
work
this
man
of
sancerre
had
a
facility
a
carelessness
if
you
call
it
so
which
ranked
him
with
those
writers
who
are
mere
scriveners
literary
hacks
in
paris
in
our
day
cuts
a
man
off
from
every
pretension
to
a
literary
position
when
he
can
do
no
more
or
no
longer
cares
for
advancement
the
man
who
can
write
becomes
a
journalist
and
a
hack
the
life
he
leads
is
not
unpleasing
beginners
in
every
walk
of
life
actresses
at
the
outset
or
the
close
of
a
career
publishers
and
authors
all
make
much
of
these
writers
of
the
ready
pen
lousteau
a
thorough
man
about
town
lived
at
scarcely
any
expense
beyond
paying
his
rent
he
had
boxes
at
all
the
theatres
the
sale
of
the
books
he
reviewed
or
left
unreviewed
paid
for
his
gloves
and
he
would
say
to
those
authors
who
published
at
their
own
expense
i
have
your
book
always
in
my
hands
he
took
toll
from
vanity
in
the
form
of
drawings
or
pictures
every
day
had
its
engagements
to
dinner
every
night
its
theatre
every
morning
was
filled
up
with
callers
visits
and
lounging
his
serial
in
the
paper
two
novels
a
year
for
weekly
magazines
and
his
miscellaneous
articles
were
the
tax
he
paid
for
this
life
and
yet
to
reach
this
position
etienne
had
struggled
for
ten
years
at
the
present
time
known
to
the
literary
world
liked
for
the
good
or
the
mischief
he
did
with
equally
facile
good
humor
he
let
himself
float
with
the
stream
never
caring
for
the
future
he
ruled
a
little
set
of
newcomers
he
had
friendships
or
rather
habits
of
fifteen
years
standing
and
men
with
whom
he
supped
and
dined
and
indulged
his
wit
he
earned
from
seven
to
eight
hundred
francs
a
month
a
sum
which
he
found
quite
insufficient
for
the
prodigality
peculiar
to
the
impecunious
indeed
lousteau
found
himself
now
just
as
hard
up
as
when
on
first
appearing
in
paris
he
had
said
to
himself
if
i
had
but
five
hundred
francs
a
month
i
should
be
rich
the
cause
of
this
phenomenon
was
as
follows
lousteau
lived
in
the
rue
des
martyrs
in
pretty
rooms
with
a
garden
and
splendidly
furnished
when
he
settled
there
in
he
had
come
to
an
agreement
with
an
upholsterer
that
kept
his
pocket
money
low
for
a
long
time
these
rooms
were
let
for
twelve
hundred
francs
the
months
of
january
april
july
and
october
were
as
he
phrased
it
his
indigent
months
the
rent
and
the
porter
s
account
cleaned
him
out
lousteau
took
no
fewer
hackney
cabs
spend
a
hundred
francs
in
breakfasts
all
the
same
smoked
thirty
francs
worth
of
cigars
and
could
never
refuse
the
mistress
of
a
day
a
dinner
or
a
new
dress
he
thus
dipped
so
deeply
into
the
fluctuating
earnings
of
the
following
months
that
he
could
no
more
find
a
hundred
francs
on
his
now
when
he
was
making
seven
or
eight
hundred
francs
a
month
than
he
could
in
when
he
was
hardly
getting
two
hundred
tired
sometimes
by
the
incessant
vicissitudes
of
a
literary
life
and
as
much
bored
by
amusement
as
a
courtesan
lousteau
would
get
out
of
the
tideway
and
sit
on
the
bank
and
say
to
one
and
another
of
his
intimate
allies
nathan
or
bixiou
as
they
sat
smoking
in
his
scrap
of
garden
looking
out
on
an
evergreen
lawn
as
big
as
a
what
will
be
the
end
of
us
white
hairs
are
giving
us
respectful
hints
lord
we
shall
marry
when
we
choose
to
give
as
much
thought
to
the
matter
as
we
give
to
a
drama
or
a
novel
said
nathan
and
florine
retorted
bixiou
oh
we
all
have
a
florine
said
etienne
flinging
away
the
end
of
his
cigar
and
thinking
of
madame
schontz
madame
schontz
was
a
pretty
enough
woman
to
put
a
very
high
price
on
the
interest
on
her
beauty
while
reserving
absolute
ownership
for
lousteau
the
man
of
her
heart
like
all
those
women
who
get
the
name
in
paris
of
from
the
church
of
notre
dame
de
lorette
round
about
which
they
dwell
she
lived
in
the
rue
flechier
a
stone
s
throw
from
lousteau
this
lady
took
a
pride
and
delight
in
teasing
her
friends
by
boasting
of
having
a
wit
for
her
lover
these
details
of
lousteau
s
life
and
fortune
are
indispensable
for
this
penury
and
this
bohemian
existence
of
a
man
to
whom
parisian
luxury
had
become
a
necessity
were
fated
to
have
a
cruel
influence
on
dinah
s
life
those
to
whom
the
bohemia
of
paris
is
familiar
will
now
understand
how
it
was
that
by
the
end
of
a
fortnight
the
journalist
up
to
his
ears
in
the
literary
environment
could
laugh
about
his
baroness
with
his
friends
and
even
with
madame
schontz
to
such
readers
as
regard
such
things
as
utterly
mean
it
is
almost
useless
to
make
excuses
which
they
will
not
accept
what
did
you
do
at
sancerre
asked
bixiou
the
first
time
he
met
lousteau
i
did
good
service
to
three
worthy
provincials
a
of
taxes
a
little
cousin
of
his
and
a
public
prosecutor
who
for
ten
years
had
been
dancing
round
and
round
one
of
the
hundred
tenth
muses
who
adorn
the
departments
said
he
but
they
had
no
more
dared
to
touch
her
than
we
touch
a
decorated
cream
at
dessert
till
some
person
has
made
a
hole
in
poor
boy
said
bixiou
i
said
you
had
gone
to
sancerre
to
turn
pegasus
out
to
your
joke
is
as
stupid
as
my
muse
is
handsome
retorted
lousteau
ask
bianchon
my
dear
a
muse
and
a
poet
a
homoeopathic
cure
then
said
bixiou
on
the
tenth
day
lousteau
received
a
letter
with
the
sancerre
good
very
good
said
lousteau
beloved
friend
idol
of
my
heart
and
soul
twenty
pages
of
it
all
at
one
sitting
and
dated
midnight
she
writes
when
she
finds
herself
alone
poor
woman
ah
ha
and
a
postscript
i
dare
not
ask
you
to
write
to
me
as
i
write
every
day
still
i
hope
to
have
a
few
lines
from
my
dear
one
every
week
to
relieve
my
what
a
pity
to
burn
it
all
it
is
really
well
written
said
lousteau
to
himself
as
he
threw
the
ten
sheets
of
paper
into
the
fire
after
having
read
them
that
woman
was
born
to
reel
off
copy
lousteau
was
not
much
afraid
of
madame
schontz
who
really
loved
him
for
himself
but
he
had
supplanted
a
friend
in
the
heart
of
a
marquise
this
marquise
a
lady
nowise
coy
sometimes
dropped
in
unexpectedly
at
his
rooms
in
the
evening
arriving
veiled
in
a
hackney
coach
and
she
as
a
literary
woman
allowed
herself
to
hunt
through
all
his
drawers
a
week
later
lousteau
who
hardly
remembered
dinah
was
startled
by
another
budget
from
sancerre
eight
leaves
sixteen
pages
he
heard
a
woman
s
step
he
thought
it
announced
a
search
from
the
marquise
and
tossed
these
rapturous
and
entrancing
proofs
of
affections
into
the
fire
unread
a
woman
s
letter
exclaimed
madame
schontz
as
she
came
in
the
paper
the
wax
are
scented
here
you
are
sir
said
a
porter
from
the
coach
office
setting
down
two
huge
hampers
in
the
carriage
paid
please
to
sign
my
carriage
paid
cried
madame
schontz
it
must
have
come
from
yes
madame
said
the
porter
your
tenth
muse
is
a
remarkably
intelligent
woman
said
the
courtesan
opening
one
of
the
hampers
while
lousteau
was
writing
his
name
i
like
a
muse
who
understands
housekeeping
and
who
can
make
game
pies
as
well
as
blots
and
oh
what
beautiful
flowers
she
went
on
opening
the
second
hamper
why
you
could
get
none
finer
in
paris
and
here
and
here
a
hare
partridges
half
a
roebuck
we
will
ask
your
friends
and
have
a
famous
dinner
for
athalie
has
a
special
talent
for
dressing
lousteau
wrote
to
dinah
but
instead
of
writing
from
the
heart
he
was
clever
the
letter
was
all
the
more
insidious
it
was
like
one
of
mirabeau
s
letters
to
sophie
the
style
of
a
true
lover
is
transparent
it
is
a
clear
stream
which
allows
the
bottom
of
the
heart
to
be
seen
between
two
banks
bright
with
the
trifles
of
existence
and
covered
with
the
flowers
of
the
soul
that
blossom
afresh
every
day
full
of
intoxicating
beauty
but
only
for
two
beings
as
soon
as
a
love
letter
has
any
charm
for
a
third
reader
it
is
beyond
doubt
the
product
of
the
head
not
of
the
heart
but
a
woman
will
always
be
beguiled
she
always
believes
herself
to
be
the
determining
cause
of
this
flow
of
wit
by
the
end
of
december
lousteau
had
ceased
to
read
dinah
s
letters
they
lay
in
a
heap
in
a
drawer
of
his
chest
that
was
never
locked
under
his
shirts
which
they
scented
then
one
of
those
chances
came
to
lousteau
which
such
bohemians
ought
to
clutch
by
every
hair
in
the
middle
of
december
madame
schontz
who
took
a
real
interest
in
etienne
sent
to
beg
him
to
call
on
her
one
morning
on
business
my
dear
fellow
you
have
a
chance
of
i
can
marry
very
often
happily
my
when
i
say
marrying
i
mean
marrying
well
you
have
no
prejudices
i
need
not
mince
matters
this
is
the
position
a
young
lady
has
got
into
trouble
her
mother
knows
nothing
of
even
a
kiss
her
father
is
an
honest
notary
a
man
of
honor
he
has
been
wise
enough
to
keep
it
dark
he
wants
to
get
his
daughter
married
within
a
fortnight
and
he
will
give
her
a
fortune
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
for
he
has
three
other
children
but
and
it
is
not
a
bad
idea
he
will
add
a
hundred
thousand
francs
under
the
rose
hand
to
hand
to
cover
the
damages
they
are
an
old
family
of
paris
citizens
rue
des
lombards
well
then
why
does
not
the
lover
marry
her
what
a
romance
such
things
are
nowhere
to
be
heard
of
but
in
the
rue
des
but
do
not
take
it
into
your
head
that
a
jealous
brother
murdered
the
seducer
the
young
man
died
in
the
most
commonplace
way
of
a
pleurisy
caught
as
he
came
out
of
the
theatre
a
and
penniless
the
man
entrapped
the
daughter
in
order
to
marry
into
the
business
a
judgment
from
heaven
i
call
it
where
did
you
hear
the
story
from
malaga
the
notary
is
her
what
cardot
the
son
of
that
little
old
man
in
florentine
s
first
friend
just
so
malaga
whose
fancy
is
a
little
tomtit
of
a
fiddler
of
eighteen
can
not
in
conscience
make
such
a
boy
marry
the
girl
besides
she
has
no
cause
to
do
him
an
ill
indeed
monsieur
cardot
wants
a
man
of
thirty
at
least
our
notary
i
feel
sure
will
be
proud
to
have
a
famous
man
for
his
so
just
feel
yourself
all
you
will
pay
your
debts
you
will
have
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
and
be
a
father
without
any
trouble
on
your
part
what
do
you
say
to
that
to
the
good
and
after
all
you
only
marry
a
very
consolable
widow
there
is
an
income
of
fifty
thousand
francs
in
the
house
and
the
value
of
the
connection
so
in
due
time
you
may
look
forward
to
not
less
than
fifteen
thousand
francs
a
year
more
for
your
share
and
you
will
enter
a
family
holding
a
fine
political
position
cardot
is
the
of
old
camusot
the
depute
who
lived
so
long
with
fanny
yes
said
lousteau
old
camusot
married
little
daddy
cardot
s
eldest
daughter
and
they
had
high
times
together
well
madame
schontz
went
on
and
madame
cardot
the
notary
s
wife
was
a
chiffreville
manufacturers
of
chemical
products
the
aristocracy
of
these
days
potash
i
tell
you
still
this
is
the
unpleasant
side
of
the
matter
you
will
have
a
terrible
a
woman
capable
of
killing
her
daughter
if
she
knew
this
cardot
woman
is
a
bigot
she
has
lips
like
two
faded
narrow
pink
ribbons
a
man
of
the
town
like
you
would
never
pass
muster
with
that
woman
who
in
her
way
will
spy
out
your
bachelor
life
and
know
every
fact
of
the
past
however
cardot
says
he
means
to
exert
his
paternal
authority
the
poor
man
will
be
obliged
to
do
the
civil
to
his
wife
for
some
days
a
woman
made
of
wood
my
dear
fellow
malaga
who
has
seen
her
calls
her
a
penitential
scrubber
cardot
is
a
man
of
forty
he
will
be
mayor
of
his
district
and
perhaps
be
elected
deputy
he
is
prepared
to
give
in
lieu
of
the
hundred
thousand
francs
a
nice
little
house
in
the
rue
with
a
forecourt
and
a
garden
which
cost
him
no
more
than
sixty
thousand
at
the
time
of
the
july
overthrow
he
would
sell
and
that
would
be
an
opportunity
for
you
to
go
and
come
at
the
house
to
see
the
daughter
and
be
civil
to
the
and
it
would
give
you
a
look
of
property
in
madame
cardot
s
eyes
you
would
be
housed
like
a
prince
in
that
little
mansion
then
by
camusot
s
interest
you
may
get
an
appointment
as
librarian
to
some
public
office
where
there
is
no
well
and
then
if
you
invest
your
money
in
backing
up
a
newspaper
you
will
get
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
on
it
you
can
earn
six
your
librarianship
will
bring
you
in
can
you
do
better
for
yourself
if
you
were
to
marry
a
lamb
without
spot
it
might
be
a
light
woman
by
the
end
of
two
years
what
is
the
damage
an
anticipated
dividend
it
is
quite
the
fashion
take
my
word
for
it
you
can
do
no
better
than
come
to
dine
with
malaga
you
will
meet
your
he
will
know
the
secret
has
been
let
out
by
malaga
with
whom
he
can
not
be
angry
and
then
you
are
master
of
the
situation
as
to
your
wife
why
her
misconduct
leaves
you
as
free
as
a
bachelor
your
language
is
as
blunt
as
a
cannon
i
love
you
for
your
own
sake
that
is
all
and
i
can
reason
well
why
do
you
stand
there
like
a
wax
image
of
there
is
nothing
to
meditate
over
marriage
is
heads
or
tails
well
you
have
tossed
heads
you
shall
have
my
reply
said
lousteau
i
would
sooner
have
it
at
once
malaga
will
write
you
up
well
then
lousteau
spent
the
evening
in
writing
a
long
letter
to
the
marquise
giving
her
the
reasons
which
compelled
him
to
marry
his
constant
poverty
the
torpor
of
his
imagination
his
white
hairs
his
moral
and
physical
exhaustion
in
short
four
pages
of
as
to
dinah
i
will
send
her
a
circular
announcing
the
marriage
said
he
to
himself
as
bixiou
says
i
have
not
my
match
for
knowing
how
to
dock
the
tail
of
a
lousteau
who
at
first
had
been
on
some
ceremony
with
himself
by
next
day
had
come
to
the
point
of
dreading
lest
the
marriage
should
not
come
off
he
was
pressingly
civil
to
the
notary
i
knew
monsieur
your
father
said
he
at
florentine
s
so
i
may
well
know
you
here
at
mademoiselle
turquet
s
like
father
like
son
a
very
good
fellow
and
a
philosopher
was
little
daddy
cardot
excuse
me
we
always
called
him
so
at
that
time
florine
florentine
tullia
coralie
and
mariette
were
the
five
fingers
of
your
hand
so
to
speak
it
is
fifteen
years
ago
my
follies
as
you
may
suppose
are
a
thing
of
the
in
those
days
it
was
pleasure
that
ran
away
with
me
now
i
am
ambitious
but
in
our
day
to
get
on
at
all
a
man
must
be
free
from
debt
have
a
good
income
a
wife
and
a
family
if
i
pay
taxes
enough
to
qualify
me
i
may
be
a
deputy
yet
like
any
other
maitre
cardot
appreciated
this
profession
of
faith
lousteau
had
laid
himself
out
to
please
and
the
notary
liked
him
feeling
himself
more
at
his
ease
as
may
be
easily
imagined
with
a
man
who
had
known
his
father
s
secrets
than
he
would
have
been
with
another
on
the
following
day
lousteau
was
introduced
to
the
cardot
family
as
the
purchaser
of
the
house
in
the
rue
and
three
days
later
he
dined
there
cardot
lived
in
an
old
house
near
the
place
du
chatelet
in
this
house
everything
was
economy
covered
every
scrap
of
gilding
with
green
gauze
all
the
furniture
wore
holland
covers
though
it
was
impossible
to
feel
a
shade
of
uneasiness
as
to
the
wealth
of
the
inhabitants
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
no
one
could
suppress
a
yawn
boredom
perched
in
every
nook
the
curtains
hung
dolefully
the
was
like
harpagon
s
even
if
lousteau
had
not
known
all
about
malaga
he
could
have
guessed
that
the
notary
s
real
life
was
spent
elsewhere
the
journalist
saw
a
tall
fair
girl
with
blue
eyes
at
once
shy
and
languishing
the
elder
brother
took
a
fancy
to
him
he
was
the
fourth
clerk
in
the
office
but
strongly
attracted
by
the
snares
of
literary
fame
though
destined
to
succeed
his
father
the
younger
sister
was
twelve
years
old
lousteau
assuming
a
little
jesuitical
air
played
the
monarchist
and
churchman
for
the
benefit
of
the
mother
was
quite
smooth
deliberate
and
complimentary
within
three
weeks
of
their
introduction
at
his
fourth
dinner
there
felicie
cardot
who
had
been
watching
lousteau
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
carried
him
a
cup
of
coffee
where
he
stood
in
the
window
recess
and
said
in
a
low
voice
with
tears
in
her
eyes
i
will
devote
my
whole
life
monsieur
to
thanking
you
for
your
sacrifice
in
favor
of
a
poor
girl
lousteau
was
touched
there
was
so
much
expression
in
her
look
her
accent
her
attitude
she
would
make
a
good
man
happy
thought
he
pressing
her
hand
in
reply
madame
cardot
looked
upon
her
as
a
man
with
a
future
before
him
but
above
all
the
fine
qualities
she
ascribed
to
him
she
was
most
delighted
by
his
high
tone
of
morals
etienne
prompted
by
the
wily
notary
had
pledged
his
word
that
he
had
no
natural
children
no
tie
that
could
endanger
the
happiness
of
her
dear
felicie
you
may
perhaps
think
i
go
rather
too
far
said
the
bigot
to
the
journalist
but
in
giving
such
a
jewel
as
my
felicie
to
any
man
one
must
think
of
the
future
i
am
not
one
of
those
mothers
who
want
to
be
rid
of
their
daughters
monsieur
cardot
hurries
matters
on
urges
forward
his
daughter
s
marriage
he
wishes
it
over
this
is
the
only
point
on
which
we
though
with
a
man
like
you
monsieur
a
literary
man
whose
youth
has
been
preserved
by
hard
work
from
the
moral
shipwreck
now
so
prevalent
we
may
feel
quite
safe
still
you
would
be
the
first
to
laugh
at
me
if
i
looked
for
a
husband
for
my
daughter
with
my
eyes
shut
i
know
you
are
not
an
innocent
and
i
should
be
very
sorry
for
my
felicie
if
you
were
this
was
said
in
a
whisper
but
if
you
had
any
for
instance
monsieur
you
have
heard
of
madame
roguin
the
wife
of
a
notary
who
unhappily
for
our
faculty
was
sadly
notorious
madame
roguin
has
ever
since
been
kept
by
a
banker
yes
du
tillet
replied
etienne
but
he
bit
his
tongue
as
he
recollected
how
rash
it
was
to
confess
to
an
acquaintance
with
du
tillet
well
monsieur
if
you
were
a
mother
would
you
not
quake
at
the
thought
that
madame
du
tillet
s
fate
might
be
your
child
s
at
her
age
and
de
granville
to
have
as
a
rival
a
woman
of
fifty
and
more
sooner
would
i
see
my
daughter
dead
than
give
her
to
a
man
who
had
such
a
connection
with
a
married
woman
a
grisette
an
actress
you
take
her
and
leave
there
is
no
danger
in
my
opinion
from
women
of
that
stamp
love
is
their
trade
they
care
for
no
one
one
down
and
another
to
come
on
but
a
woman
who
has
sinned
against
duty
must
hug
her
sin
her
only
excuse
is
constancy
if
such
a
crime
can
ever
have
an
excuse
at
least
that
is
the
view
i
hold
of
a
respectable
woman
s
fall
and
that
is
what
makes
it
so
terrible
instead
of
looking
for
the
meaning
of
these
speeches
etienne
made
a
jest
of
them
at
malaga
s
whither
he
went
with
his
elect
for
the
notary
and
the
journalist
were
the
best
of
friends
lousteau
had
already
given
himself
the
airs
of
a
person
of
importance
his
life
at
last
was
to
have
a
purpose
he
was
in
luck
s
way
and
in
a
few
days
would
be
the
owner
of
a
delightful
little
house
in
the
rue
he
was
going
to
be
married
to
a
charming
woman
he
would
have
about
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
and
could
give
the
reins
to
his
ambition
the
young
lady
loved
him
and
he
would
be
connected
with
several
respectable
families
in
short
he
was
in
full
sail
on
the
blue
waters
of
hope
madame
cardot
had
expressed
a
wish
to
see
the
prints
for
one
of
the
illustrated
volumes
which
the
french
publishers
were
at
that
time
bringing
out
and
lousteau
had
taken
the
first
numbers
for
the
lady
s
inspection
the
lawyer
s
wife
had
a
scheme
of
her
own
she
had
borrowed
the
book
merely
to
return
it
she
wanted
an
excuse
for
walking
in
on
her
future
quite
unexpectedly
the
sight
of
those
bachelor
rooms
which
her
husband
had
described
as
charming
would
tell
her
more
she
thought
as
to
lousteau
s
habits
of
life
than
any
information
she
could
pick
up
her
madame
camusot
who
knew
nothing
of
the
fateful
secret
was
terrified
at
such
a
marriage
for
her
niece
monsieur
camusot
a
councillor
of
the
supreme
court
old
camusot
s
son
by
his
first
marriage
had
given
his
who
was
cardot
s
sister
a
far
from
flattering
account
of
the
journalist
lousteau
clever
as
he
was
did
not
think
it
strange
that
the
wife
of
a
rich
notary
should
wish
to
inspect
a
volume
costing
fifteen
francs
before
deciding
on
the
purchase
your
clever
man
never
condescends
to
study
the
who
escape
his
ken
by
this
want
of
attention
and
while
he
is
making
game
of
them
they
are
at
leisure
to
throttle
him
so
one
day
early
in
january
madame
cardot
and
her
daughter
took
a
hackney
coach
and
went
to
the
rue
des
martyrs
to
return
the
parts
of
to
felicie
s
betrothed
both
delighted
at
the
thought
of
seeing
lousteau
s
rooms
these
domiciliary
visitations
are
not
unusual
in
the
old
citizen
class
the
porter
at
the
front
gate
was
not
in
but
his
daughter
on
being
informed
by
the
worthy
lady
that
she
was
in
the
presence
of
monsieur
lousteau
s
future
and
bride
handed
over
the
key
of
the
apartment
all
the
more
readily
because
madame
cardot
placed
a
gold
piece
in
her
hand
it
was
by
this
time
about
noon
the
hour
at
which
the
journalist
would
return
from
breakfasting
at
the
cafe
anglais
as
he
crossed
the
open
space
between
the
church
of
de
lorette
and
the
rue
des
martyrs
lousteau
happened
to
look
at
a
hired
coach
that
was
toiling
up
the
rue
du
and
he
fancied
it
was
a
dream
when
he
saw
the
face
of
dinah
he
stood
frozen
to
the
spot
when
on
reaching
his
house
he
beheld
his
didine
at
the
coach
door
what
has
brought
you
here
he
he
adopted
the
familiar
the
formality
of
was
out
of
the
question
to
a
woman
he
must
get
rid
of
why
my
love
cried
she
have
you
not
read
my
letters
certainly
i
have
said
lousteau
well
then
well
then
you
are
a
father
replied
the
country
lady
faugh
cried
he
disregarding
the
barbarity
of
such
an
exclamation
well
thought
he
to
himself
she
must
be
prepared
for
the
he
signed
to
the
coachman
to
wait
gave
his
hand
to
madame
de
la
baudraye
and
left
the
man
with
the
chaise
full
of
trunks
vowing
that
he
would
send
away
as
he
said
to
himself
the
woman
and
her
luggage
back
to
the
place
she
had
come
from
monsieur
monsieur
called
out
little
pamela
the
child
had
some
sense
and
felt
that
three
women
must
not
be
allowed
to
meet
in
a
bachelor
s
rooms
well
well
said
lousteau
dragging
dinah
along
pamela
concluded
that
the
lady
must
be
some
relation
however
she
added
the
key
is
in
the
door
your
is
in
his
agitation
while
madame
de
la
baudraye
was
pouring
out
a
flood
of
words
etienne
understood
the
child
to
say
mother
is
there
the
only
circumstance
that
suggested
itself
as
possible
and
he
went
in
felicie
and
her
mother
who
were
by
this
time
in
the
crept
into
a
corner
on
seeing
etienne
enter
with
a
woman
at
last
etienne
my
dearest
i
am
yours
for
life
cried
dinah
throwing
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
clasping
him
closely
while
he
took
the
key
from
the
outside
of
the
door
life
is
a
perpetual
anguish
to
me
in
that
house
at
anzy
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
when
the
time
came
for
me
to
proclaim
my
happiness
well
i
had
not
the
here
i
am
your
wife
with
your
child
and
you
have
not
written
to
me
you
have
left
me
two
months
without
a
but
dinah
you
place
me
in
the
greatest
difficulty
do
you
love
me
how
can
i
do
otherwise
than
love
you
but
would
you
not
have
been
wiser
to
remain
at
sancerre
i
am
in
the
most
abject
poverty
and
i
fear
to
drag
you
into
it
your
misery
will
be
paradise
to
me
i
only
ask
to
live
here
never
to
go
out
good
god
that
is
all
very
fine
in
words
but
dinah
sat
down
and
melted
into
tears
as
she
heard
this
speech
roughly
spoken
lousteau
could
not
resist
this
distress
he
clasped
the
baroness
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
do
not
cry
didine
said
he
and
as
he
uttered
the
words
he
saw
in
the
mirror
the
figure
of
madame
cardot
looking
at
him
from
the
further
end
of
the
rooms
come
didine
go
with
pamela
and
get
your
trunks
unloaded
said
he
in
her
ear
go
do
not
cry
we
will
be
happy
he
led
her
to
the
door
and
then
came
back
to
divert
the
storm
monsieur
said
madame
cardot
i
congratulate
myself
on
having
resolved
to
see
for
myself
the
home
of
the
man
who
was
to
have
been
my
if
my
daughter
were
to
die
of
it
she
should
never
be
the
wife
of
such
a
man
as
you
you
must
devote
yourself
to
making
your
didine
happy
and
the
virtuous
lady
walked
out
followed
by
felicie
who
was
crying
too
for
she
had
become
accustomed
to
etienne
the
dreadful
madame
cardot
got
into
her
again
staring
insolently
at
the
hapless
dinah
in
whose
heart
the
sting
still
rankled
of
that
is
all
very
fine
in
words
but
who
nevertheless
like
every
woman
in
love
believed
in
the
murmured
do
not
cry
didine
lousteau
who
was
not
lacking
in
the
sort
of
decision
which
grows
out
of
the
vicissitudes
of
a
life
reflected
thus
didine
is
when
once
she
knows
of
my
proposed
marriage
she
will
sacrifice
herself
for
my
future
prospects

i
know
how
i
can
manage
to
let
her

hit
on
a

tune

didine
once
out

he
went
on
talking

himself

by

to
the

in
all
paris
most
delighted
in
such
practical
jokes
in
the
slang
of
artists
a
charge
lousteau
made
a
great
show
of
settling
the
muse
of
sancerre
in
his
apartment
he
busied
himself
in
arranging
the
luggage
she
had
brought
and
informed
her
as
to
the
persons
and
ways
of
the
house
with
such
perfect
good
faith
and
a
glee
which
overflowed
in
kind
words
and
caresses
that
dinah
believed
herself
the
woman
in
the
world
these
rooms
where
everything
bore
the
stamp
of
fashion
pleased
her
far
better
than
her
old
chateau
pamela
migeon
the
intelligent
damsel
of
fourteen
was
questioned
by
the
journalist
as
to
whether
she
would
like
to
be
to
the
imposing
baroness
pamela
perfectly
enchanted
entered
on
her
duties
at
once
by
going
off
to
order
dinner
from
a
restaurant
on
the
boulevard
dinah
was
able
to
judge
of
the
extreme
poverty
that
lay
hidden
under
the
purely
superficial
elegance
of
this
bachelor
home
when
she
found
none
of
the
necessaries
of
life
as
she
took
possession
of
the
closets
and
drawers
she
indulged
in
the
fondest
dreams
she
would
alter
etienne
s
habits
she
would
make
him
she
would
fill
his
cup
of
domestic
happiness
the
novelty
of
the
position
hid
its
disastrous
side
dinah
regarded
reciprocated
love
as
the
absolution
of
her
sin
she
did
not
yet
look
beyond
the
walls
of
these
rooms
pamela
whose
wits
were
as
sharp
as
those
of
a
went
straight
to
madame
schontz
to
beg
the
loan
of
some
plate
telling
her
what
had
happened
to
lousteau
after
making
the
child
welcome
to
all
she
had
madame
schontz
went
off
to
her
friend
malaga
that
cardot
might
be
warned
of
the
catastrophe
that
had
befallen
his
future
the
journalist
not
in
the
least
uneasy
about
the
crisis
as
affecting
his
marriage
was
more
and
more
charming
to
the
lady
from
the
provinces
the
dinner
was
the
occasion
of
the
delightful
child
of
lovers
set
at
liberty
and
happy
to
be
free
when
they
had
had
their
coffee
and
lousteau
was
sitting
in
front
of
the
fire
dinah
on
his
knee
pamela
ran
in
with
a
scared
face
here
is
monsieur
bixiou

into
the
bedroom
said
the
journalist
to
his
mistress
i
will
soon
get
rid
of
him

is
one
of
my
most
intimate
friends
and
i
shall
have
to
explain

him
my
new
start
in

for
two
and
a
blue
velvet
bonnet
cried
bixiou
i
am
ah
that
is
what
comes
of
marrying

go
through
some
partings
how
rich
one
feels
when
one
begins
to
move
one
s
sticks
heh
who
talks
of
marrying
said
lousteau
what
are
you
not
going
to
be
married
then
cried
bixiou
no
no
my
word
what
next
are
you
making
a
fool
of
yourself
if
you
please
what
you
who
by
the
mercy
of
heaven
have
come
across
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
and
a
house
and
a
wife
connected
with
all
the
first
families
of
the
better
middle
class
a
wife
in
short
out
of
the
rue
des
lombards
that
will
do
bixiou
enough
it
is
at
an
end
be
off
be
off
i
have
a
friend
s
privileges
and
i
shall
take
every
advantage
of
what
has
come
over
you
what
has
come
over
me
is
my
lady
from
sancerre
she
is
a
mother
and
we
are
going
to
live
together
happily
to
the
end
of
our
you
would
have
heard
it
so
you
may
as
well
be
told
it
many
are
falling
on
my
head
as
arnal
says
but
if
this
woman
really
loves
you
my
dear
fellow
she
will
go
back
to
the
place
she
came
from
did
any
provincial
woman
ever
yet
find
her
in
paris
she
will
wound
all
your
vanities
have
you
forgotten
what
a
provincial
is
she
will
bore
you
as
much
when
she
is
happy
as
when
she
is
sad
she
will
have
as
great
a
talent
for
escaping
grace
as
a
parisian
has
in
inventing
it
lousteau
listen
to
me
that
a
passion
should
lead
you
to
forget
to
some
extent
the
times
in
which
we
live
is
conceivable
but
i
my
dear
fellow
have
not
the
mythological
bandage
over
my
well
then
consider
your
position
for
fifteen
years
you
have
been
tossing
in
the
literary
world
you
are
no
longer
young
you
have
padded
the
hoof
till
your
soles
are
worn
through
yes
my
boy
you
turn
your
socks
under
like
a
street
urchin
to
hide
the
holes
so
that
the
legs
cover
the
heels
in
short
the
joke
is
too
stale
your
excuses
are
more
familiar
than
a
patent
medicine
i
may
say
to
you
like
the
regent
to
cardinal
dubois
that
is
kicking
enough
said
lousteau
laughing
oh
venerable
young
man
replied
bixiou
the
iron
has
touched
the
sore
to
the
quick
you
are
worn
out
aren
t
you
well
then
in
the
heyday
of
youth
under
the
pressure
of
penury
what
have
you
done
you
are
not
in
the
front
rank
and
you
have
not
a
thousand
francs
of
your
own
that
is
the
of
the
situation
can
you
in
the
decline
of
your
powers
support
a
family
by
your
pen
when
your
wife
if
she
is
an
honest
woman
will
not
have
at
her
command
the
resources
of
the
woman
of
the
streets
who
can
extract
her
note
from
the
depths
where
milord
keeps
it
safe
you
are
rushing
into
the
lowest
depths
of
the
social
theatre
and
this
is
only
the
financial
side
now
consider
the
political
position
we
are
struggling
in
an
essentially
age
in
which
honor
virtue
talent
learning
genius
in
short
is
summed
up
in
paying
your
way
owing
nobody
anything
and
conducting
your
affairs
with
judgment
be
steady
be
respectable
have
a
wife
and
children
pay
your
rent
and
taxes
serve
in
the
national
guard
and
be
on
the
same
pattern
as
all
the
men
of
your
company
then
you
may
indulge
in
the
loftiest
pretensions
rise
to
the
ministry
and
you
have
the
best
chances
possible
since
you
are
no
montmorency
you
were
preparing
to
fulfil
all
the
conditions
insisted
on
for
turning
out
a
political
personage
you
are
capable
of
every
mean
trick
that
is
necessary
in
office
even
of
pretending
to
be
commonplace
you
would
have
acted
it
to
the
life
and
just
for
a
woman
who
will
leave
you
in
the
lurch
the
end
of
every
eternal
passion
in
three
five
or
seven
years
after
exhausting
your
last
physical
and
intellectual
powers
you
turn
your
back
on
the
sacred
hearth
on
the
rue
des
lombards
on
a
political
career
on
thirty
thousand
francs
per
annum
on
respectability
and
respect
ought
that
to
be
the
end
of
a
man
who
has
done
with
illusions
if
you
had
kept
a
pot
boiling
for
some
actress
who
gave
you
your
fun
for
it
well
that
is
what
you
may
call
a
cabinet
matter
but
to
live
with
another
man
s
wife
it
is
a
draft
at
sight
on
disaster
it
is
bolting
the
bitter
pills
of
vice
with
none
of
the
that
will
do
one
word
answers
it
all
i
love
madame
de
la
baudraye
and
prefer
her
to
every
fortune
to
every
position
the
world
can
i
may
have
been
carried
away
by
a
gust
of
ambition
but
everything
must
give
way
to
the
joy
of
being
a
ah
ha
you
have
a
fancy
for
paternity
but
wretched
man
we
are
the
fathers
only
of
our
legitimate
children
what
is
a
brat
that
does
not
bear
your
name
the
last
chapter
of
the
your
child
will
be
taken
from
you
we
have
seen
that
story
in
twenty
plays
these
ten
years
past
society
my
dear
boy
will
drop
upon
you
sooner
or
later
read
once
dear
me
i
fancy
i
can
see
you
when
you
and
she
are
used
to
each
other
i
see
you
dejected
bereft
of
position
and
fortune
and
fighting
like
the
shareholders
of
a
bogus
company
when
they
are
tricked
by
a
director
your
director
is
say
no
more
but
i
have
only
just
begun
said
bixiou
listen
my
dear
boy
marriage
has
been
out
of
favor
for
some
time
past
but
apart
from
the
advantages
it
offers
in
being
the
only
recognized
way
of
certifying
heredity
as
it
affords
a
young
man
though
penniless
the
opportunity
of
making
his
fortune
in
two
months
it
survives
in
spite
of
disadvantages
and
there
is
not
the
man
living
who
would
not
repent
sooner
or
later
of
having
by
his
own
fault
lost
the
chance
of
marrying
thirty
thousand
francs
a
you
won
t
understand
me
cried
lousteau
in
a
voice
of
exasperation
go
away
she
is
there
i
beg
your
pardon
why
did
you
not
tell
me
sooner
you
are
of
age
and
so
is
she
he
added
in
a
lower
voice
but
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
dinah
she
will
make
you
repent
bitterly
of
your
happiness
if
it
is
a
folly
i
intend
to
commit
a
man
gone
overboard
cried
bixiou
devil
take
those
friends
who
think
they
have
a
right
to
preach
to
you
said
lousteau
opening
the
door
of
the
bedroom
where
he
found
madame
de
la
baudraye
sunk
in
an
armchair
and
dabbing
her
eyes
with
an
embroidered
handkerchief
oh
why
did
i
come
here
sobbed
she
good
heavens
why
indeed
etienne
i
am
not
so
provincial
as
you
think
you
are
making
a
fool
of
darling
angel
replied
lousteau
taking
dinah
in
his
arms
lifting
her
from
her
chair
and
dragging
her
half
dead
into
the
we
have
both
pledged
our
future
it
is
sacrifice
for
sacrifice
while
i
was
loving
you
at
sancerre
they
were
engaging
me
to
be
married
here
but
i
oh
i
was
extremely
distressed
i
am
going
cried
dinah
starting
wildly
to
her
feet
and
turning
to
the
door
you
will
stay
here
my
didine
all
is
at
an
end
and
is
this
fortune
so
lightly
earned
after
all
must
i
not
marry
a
gawky
creature
with
a
red
nose
the
daughter
of
a
notary
and
saddle
myself
with
a
stepmother
who
could
give
madame
de
piedefer
points
on
the
score
of
bigotry
pamela
flew
in
and
whispered
in
lousteau
s
ear
madame
schontz
lousteau
rose
leaving
dinah
on
the
sofa
and
went
out
it
is
all
over
with
you
my
dear
said
the
woman
cardot
does
not
mean
to
quarrel
with
his
wife
for
the
sake
of
a
the
lady
made
a
scene
something
like
a
scene
i
can
tell
you
so
to
conclude
the
who
was
the
late
s
deputy
for
two
years
agrees
to
take
the
girl
with
the
mean
wretch
exclaimed
lousteau
what
in
two
hours
he
has
made
up
his
mind
bless
me
that
is
simple
enough
the
rascal
who
knew
all
the
dead
man
s
little
secrets
guessed
what
a
fix
his
master
was
in
from
overhearing
a
few
words
of
the
squabble
with
madame
cardot
the
notary
relies
on
your
honor
and
good
feeling
for
the
affair
is
settled
the
clerk
whose
conduct
has
been
admirable
went
so
far
as
to
attend
mass
a
finished
hypocrite
i
say
just
suits
the
mamma
you
and
cardot
will
still
be
friends
he
is
to
be
a
director
in
an
immense
financial
concern
and
he
may
be
of
use
to
so
you
have
been
waked
from
a
sweet
i
have
lost
a
fortune
a
wife
and
and
a
mistress
said
madame
schontz
smiling
here
you
are
more
than
married
you
will
be
insufferable
you
will
be
always
wanting
to
get
home
there
will
be
nothing
loose
about
you
neither
your
clothes
nor
your
habits
and
after
all
my
arthur
does
things
in
style
i
will
be
faithful
to
him
and
cut
malaga
s
acquaintance
let
me
peep
at
her
through
the
door
your
sancerre
muse
she
went
on
is
there
no
finer
bird
than
that
to
be
found
in
the
desert
she
exclaimed
you
are
cheated
she
is
dignified
lean
lachrymose
she
only
needs
lady
dudley
s
turban
what
is
it
now
asked
madame
de
la
baudraye
who
had
heard
the
rustle
of
a
silk
dress
and
the
murmur
of
a
woman
s
voice
it
is
my
darling
that
we
are
now
indissolubly
i
have
just
had
an
answer
to
the
letter
you
saw
me
write
which
was
to
break
off
my
marriage
so
that
was
the
party
which
you
gave
up
oh
i
will
be
more
than
your
wife
i
am
your
slave
i
give
you
my
life
said
the
poor
deluded
creature
i
did
not
believe
i
could
love
you
more
than
i
did
now
i
shall
not
be
a
mere
incident
but
your
whole
life
yes
my
beautiful
my
generous
swear
to
me
said
she
that
only
death
shall
divide
lousteau
was
ready
to
sweeten
his
vows
with
the
most
fascinating
prettinesses
and
this
was
why
between
the
door
of
the
apartment
where
he
had
taken
the
lorette
s
farewell
kiss
and
that
of
the
where
the
muse
was
reclining
bewildered
by
such
a
succession
of
shocks
lousteau
had
remembered
little
de
la
baudraye
s
precarious
health
his
fine
fortune
and
bianchon
s
remark
about
dinah
she
will
be
a
rich
widow
and
he
said
to
himself
i
would
a
hundred
times
rather
have
madame
de
la
baudraye
for
a
wife
than
felicie
his
plan
of
action
was
quickly
decided
on
he
determined
to
play
the
farce
of
passion
once
more
and
to
perfection
his
mean
and
his
false
vehemence
of
passion
had
disastrous
results
madame
de
la
baudraye
when
she
set
out
from
sancerre
for
paris
had
intended
to
live
in
rooms
of
her
own
quite
near
to
lousteau
but
the
proofs
of
devotion
her
lover
had
given
her
by
giving
up
such
brilliant
prospects
and
yet
more
the
perfect
happiness
of
the
first
days
of
their
illicit
union
kept
her
from
mentioning
such
a
parting
the
second
day
was
to
be
and
indeed
was
a
high
festival
in
which
such
a
suggestion
proposed
to
her
angel
would
have
been
a
discordant
note
lousteau
on
his
part
anxious
to
make
dinah
feel
herself
dependent
on
him
kept
her
in
a
state
of
constant
intoxication
by
incessant
amusement
these
circumstances
hindered
two
persons
so
clever
as
these
were
from
avoiding
the
slough
into
which
they
fell
that
of
a
life
in
common
a
piece
of
folly
of
which
unfortunately
many
instances
may
be
seen
in
paris
in
literary
circles
and
thus
was
the
whole
programme
played
out
of
a
provincial
amour
so
satirically
described
by
lousteau
to
madame
de
la
baudraye
a
fact
which
neither
he
nor
she
remembered
passion
is
born
a
this
winter
in
paris
was
to
madame
de
la
baudraye
all
that
the
month
of
october
had
been
at
sancerre
etienne
to
initiate
his
wife
into
paris
life
varied
this
honeymoon
by
evenings
at
the
play
where
dinah
would
only
go
to
the
stage
box
at
first
madame
de
la
baudraye
preserved
some
remnants
of
her
countrified
modesty
she
was
afraid
of
being
seen
she
hid
her
happiness
she
would
say
monsieur
de
clagny
or
monsieur
gravier
may
have
followed
me
to
she
was
afraid
on
sancerre
even
in
paris
lousteau
who
was
excessively
vain
educated
dinah
took
her
to
the
best
dressmakers
and
pointed
out
to
her
the
most
fashionable
women
advising
her
to
take
them
as
models
for
imitation
and
madame
de
la
baudraye
s
provincial
appearance
was
soon
a
thing
of
the
past
lousteau
when
his
friends
met
him
was
congratulated
on
his
conquest
all
through
that
season
etienne
wrote
little
and
got
very
much
into
debt
though
dinah
who
was
proud
bought
all
her
clothes
out
of
her
savings
and
fancied
she
had
not
been
the
smallest
expense
to
her
beloved
by
the
end
of
three
months
dinah
was
acclimatized
she
had
reveled
in
the
music
at
the
italian
opera
she
knew
the
pieces
on
at
all
theatres
and
the
actors
and
jests
of
the
day
she
had
become
inured
to
this
life
of
perpetual
excitement
this
rapid
torrent
in
which
everything
is
forgotten
she
no
longer
craned
her
neck
or
stood
with
her
nose
in
the
air
like
an
image
of
amazement
at
the
constant
surprises
that
paris
has
for
a
stranger
she
had
learned
to
breathe
that
witty
vitalizing
teeming
atmosphere
where
clever
people
feel
themselves
in
their
element
and
which
they
can
no
longer
bear
to
quit
one
morning
as
she
read
the
papers
for
lousteau
had
them
all
two
lines
carried
her
back
to
sancerre
and
the
past
two
lines
that
seemed
not
unfamiliar
as
follows
monsieur
le
baron
de
clagny
public
prosecutor
to
the
criminal
court
at
sancerre
has
been
appointed
deputy
public
prosecutor
to
the
supreme
court
in
how
well
that
worthy
lawyer
loves
you
said
the
journalist
smiling
poor
man
said
she
what
did
i
tell
you
he
is
following
etienne
and
dinah
were
just
then
at
the
most
dazzling
and
fervid
stage
of
a
passion
when
each
is
perfectly
accustomed
to
the
other
and
yet
love
has
not
lost
its
freshness
and
relish
the
lovers
know
each
other
well
but
all
is
not
yet
understood
they
have
not
been
a
second
time
to
the
same
secret
haunts
of
the
soul
they
have
not
studied
each
other
till
they
know
as
they
must
later
the
very
thought
word
and
gesture
that
responds
to
every
event
the
greatest
and
the
smallest
enchantment
reigns
there
are
no
collisions
no
differences
of
opinion
no
cold
looks
their
two
souls
are
always
on
the
same
side
and
dinah
would
speak
the
magical
words
emphasized
by
the
yet
more
magical
expression
and
looks
which
every
woman
can
use
under
such
circumstances
when
you
cease
to
love
me
kill
if
you
should
cease
to
love
me
i
believe
i
could
kill
you
first
and
myself
to
this
sweet
exaggeration
lousteau
would
reply
all
i
ask
of
god
is
to
see
you
as
constant
as
i
shall
be
it
is
you
who
will
desert
me
my
love
is
supreme
echoed
lousteau
come
now
suppose
i
am
dragged
away
to
a
bachelor
party
and
find
there
one
of
my
former
mistresses
and
she
makes
fun
of
me
i
out
of
vanity
behave
as
if
i
were
free
and
do
not
come
in
here
till
next
morning
would
you
still
love
me
a
woman
is
only
sure
of
being
loved
when
she
is
preferred
and
if
you
came
back
to
me
if
oh
you
make
me
understand
what
the
happiness
would
be
of
forgiving
the
man
i
well
then
i
am
truly
loved
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
cried
lousteau
at
last
you
understand
that
said
she
lousteau
proposed
that
they
should
each
write
a
letter
setting
forth
the
reasons
which
would
compel
them
to
end
by
suicide
once
in
possession
of
such
a
document
each
might
kill
the
other
without
danger
in
case
of
infidelity
but
in
spite
of
mutual
promises
neither
wrote
the
letter
the
journalist
happy
for
the
moment
promised
himself
that
he
would
deceive
dinah
when
he
should
be
tired
of
her
and
would
sacrifice
everything
to
the
requirements
of
that
deception
to
him
madame
de
la
baudraye
was
a
fortune
in
herself
at
the
same
time
he
felt
the
yoke
dinah
by
consenting
to
this
union
showed
a
generous
mind
and
the
power
derived
from
in
this
absolute
intimacy
in
which
both
lovers
put
off
their
masks
the
young
woman
never
abdicated
her
modesty
her
masculine
rectitude
and
the
strength
peculiar
to
ambitious
souls
which
formed
the
basis
of
her
character
lousteau
involuntarily
held
her
in
high
esteem
as
a
parisian
dinah
was
superior
to
the
most
fascinating
courtesan
she
could
be
as
amusing
and
as
witty
as
malaga
but
her
extensive
information
her
habits
of
mind
her
vast
reading
enabled
her
to
generalize
her
wit
while
the
florines
and
the
schontzes
exerted
theirs
over
a
very
narrow
circle
there
is
in
dinah
said
etienne
to
bixiou
the
stuff
to
make
both
a
ninon
and
a
de
a
woman
who
combines
an
encyclopaedia
and
a
seraglio
is
very
dangerous
replied
the
mocking
spirit
when
the
expected
infant
became
a
visible
fact
madame
de
la
baudraye
would
be
seen
no
more
but
before
shutting
herself
up
never
to
go
out
unless
into
the
country
she
was
bent
on
being
present
at
the
first
performance
of
a
play
by
nathan
this
literary
solemnity
occupied
the
minds
of
the
two
thousand
persons
who
regard
themselves
as
constituting
all
dinah
who
had
never
been
at
a
first
night
s
performance
was
very
full
of
natural
curiosity
she
had
by
this
time
arrived
at
such
a
pitch
of
affection
for
lousteau
that
she
gloried
in
her
misconduct
she
exerted
a
sort
of
savage
strength
to
defy
the
world
she
was
determined
to
look
it
in
the
face
without
turning
her
head
aside
she
dressed
herself
to
perfection
in
a
style
suited
to
her
delicate
looks
and
the
sickly
whiteness
of
her
face
her
pallid
complexion
gave
her
an
expression
of
refinement
and
her
black
hair
in
smooth
bands
enhanced
her
pallor
her
brilliant
gray
eyes
looked
finer
than
ever
set
in
dark
rings
but
a
terribly
distressing
incident
awaited
her
by
a
very
simple
chance
the
box
given
to
the
journalist
on
the
first
tier
was
next
to
that
which
anna
grossetete
had
taken
the
two
intimate
friends
did
not
even
bow
neither
chose
to
acknowledge
the
other
at
the
end
of
the
first
act
lousteau
left
his
seat
abandoning
dinah
to
the
fire
of
eyes
the
glare
of
while
the
baronne
de
fontaine
and
the
comtesse
marie
de
vandenesse
who
accompanied
her
received
some
of
the
most
distinguished
men
of
fashion
dinah
s
solitude
was
all
the
more
distressing
because
she
had
not
the
art
of
putting
a
good
face
to
the
matter
by
examining
the
company
through
her
in
vain
did
she
try
to
assume
a
dignified
and
thoughtful
attitude
and
fix
her
eyes
on
vacancy
she
was
overpoweringly
conscious
of
being
the
object
of
general
attention
she
could
not
disguise
her
discomfort
and
lapsed
a
little
into
provincialism
displaying
her
handkerchief
and
making
involuntary
movements
of
which
she
had
almost
cured
herself
at
last
between
the
second
and
third
acts
a
man
had
himself
admitted
to
dinah
s
box
it
was
monsieur
de
clagny
i
am
happy
to
see
you
to
tell
you
how
much
i
am
pleased
by
your
promotion
said
she
oh
madame
for
whom
should
i
come
to
paris
what
said
she
have
i
anything
to
do
with
your
appointment
everything
said
he
since
you
left
sancerre
it
had
become
intolerable
to
me
i
was
dying
your
sincere
friendship
does
me
good
replied
she
holding
out
her
hand
i
am
in
a
position
to
make
much
of
my
true
friends
i
now
know
their
i
feared
i
must
have
lost
your
esteem
but
the
proof
you
have
given
me
by
this
visit
touches
me
more
deeply
than
your
ten
years
you
are
an
object
of
curiosity
to
the
whole
house
said
the
lawyer
oh
my
dear
is
this
a
part
for
you
to
be
playing
could
you
not
be
happy
and
yet
remain
honored
i
have
just
heard
that
you
are
monsieur
etienne
lousteau
s
mistress
that
you
live
together
as
man
and
wife
you
have
broken
for
ever
with
society
even
if
you
should
some
day
marry
your
lover
the
time
will
come
when
you
will
feel
the
want
of
the
respectability
you
now
despise
ought
you
not
to
be
in
a
home
of
your
own
with
your
mother
who
loves
you
well
enough
to
protect
you
with
her
aegis
appearances
at
least
would
be
i
am
in
the
wrong
to
have
come
here
replied
she
that
is
i
have
bid
farewell
to
all
the
advantages
which
the
world
confers
on
women
who
know
how
to
reconcile
happiness
and
the
proprieties
my
abnegation
is
so
complete
that
i
only
wish
i
could
clear
a
vast
space
about
me
to
make
a
desert
of
my
love
full
of
god
of
and
of
we
have
made
too
many
sacrifices
on
both
sides
not
to
be
united
united
by
disgrace
if
you
will
but
indissolubly
one
i
am
happy
so
happy
that
i
can
love
freely
my
friend
and
confide
in
you
more
than
of
old
for
i
need
a
the
lawyer
was
magnanimous
nay
truly
great
to
this
declaration
in
which
dinah
s
soul
thrilled
he
replied
in
heartrending
tones
i
wanted
to
go
to
see
you
to
be
sure
that
you
were
loved
i
shall
now
be
easy
and
no
longer
alarmed
as
to
your
but
will
your
lover
appreciate
the
magnitude
of
your
sacrifice
is
there
any
gratitude
in
his
affection
come
to
the
rue
des
martyrs
and
you
will
see
yes
i
will
call
he
replied
i
have
already
passed
your
door
without
daring
to
inquire
for
you
do
not
yet
know
the
literary
world
there
are
glorious
exceptions
no
doubt
but
these
men
of
letters
drag
terrible
evils
in
their
train
among
these
i
account
publicity
as
one
of
the
greatest
for
it
blights
everything
a
woman
may
commit
herself
with
with
a
public
prosecutor
the
baronne
put
in
with
a
smile
well
and
then
after
a
rupture
there
is
still
something
to
fall
back
on
the
world
has
known
nothing
but
with
a
more
or
less
famous
man
the
public
is
thoroughly
informed
why
look
there
what
an
example
you
have
close
at
hand
you
are
sitting
back
to
back
with
the
comtesse
marie
vandenesse
who
was
within
an
ace
of
committing
the
utmost
folly
for
a
more
celebrated
man
than
lousteau
for
nathan
and
now
they
do
not
even
recognize
each
other
after
going
to
the
very
edge
of
the
precipice
the
countess
was
saved
no
one
knows
how
she
neither
left
her
husband
nor
her
house
but
as
a
famous
man
was
scorned
she
was
the
talk
of
the
town
for
a
whole
winter
but
her
husband
s
great
fortune
great
name
and
high
position
but
for
the
admirable
management
of
that
true
statesman
whose
conduct
to
his
wife
they
say
was
perfect
she
would
have
been
ruined
in
her
position
no
other
woman
would
have
remained
respected
as
she
and
how
was
sancerre
when
you
came
away
asked
madame
de
la
baudraye
to
change
the
subject
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
announced
that
your
expected
confinement
after
so
many
years
made
it
necessary
that
it
should
take
place
in
paris
and
that
he
had
insisted
on
your
going
to
be
attended
by
the
first
physicians
replied
monsieur
de
clagny
guessing
what
it
was
that
dinah
most
wanted
to
know
and
so
in
spite
of
the
commotion
to
which
your
departure
gave
rise
you
still
have
your
legal
why
she
exclaimed
can
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
still
hope
your
husband
madame
did
what
he
always
does
made
a
little
the
lawyer
left
the
box
when
the
journalist
returned
bowing
with
dignity
you
are
a
greater
hit
than
the
piece
said
etienne
to
dinah
this
brief
triumph
brought
greater
happiness
to
the
poor
woman
than
she
had
ever
known
in
the
whole
of
her
provincial
existence
still
as
they
left
the
theatre
she
was
very
grave
what
ails
you
my
didine
asked
lousteau
i
am
wondering
how
a
woman
succeeds
in
conquering
the
world
there
are
two
ways
one
is
by
being
madame
de
stael
the
other
is
by
having
two
hundred
thousand
francs
a
society
said
she
asserts
its
hold
on
us
by
appealing
to
our
vanity
our
love
of
pooh
we
will
be
philosophers
that
evening
was
the
last
gleam
of
the
delusive
in
which
madame
de
la
baudraye
had
lived
since
coming
to
paris
three
days
later
she
observed
a
cloud
on
lousteau
s
brow
as
he
walked
round
the
little
smoking
a
cigar
this
woman
who
had
acquired
from
her
husband
the
habit
and
the
pleasure
of
never
owing
anybody
a
sou
was
informed
that
the
household
was
penniless
with
two
quarters
rent
owing
and
on
the
eve
in
fact
of
an
execution
this
reality
of
paris
life
pierced
dinah
s
heart
like
a
thorn
she
repented
of
having
tempted
etienne
into
the
extravagances
of
love
it
is
so
difficult
to
pass
from
pleasure
to
work
that
happiness
has
wrecked
more
poems
than
sorrows
ever
helped
to
flow
in
sparkling
jets
dinah
happy
in
seeing
etienne
taking
his
ease
smoking
a
cigar
after
breakfast
his
face
beaming
as
he
basked
like
a
lizard
in
the
sunshine
could
not
summon
up
courage
enough
to
make
herself
the
of
a
magazine
it
struck
her
that
through
the
worthy
migeon
pamela
s
father
she
might
pawn
the
few
jewels
she
possessed
on
which
her
uncle
for
she
was
learning
to
talk
the
slang
of
the
town
advanced
her
nine
hundred
francs
she
kept
three
hundred
for
her
and
the
expenses
of
her
illness
and
joyfully
presented
the
sum
due
to
lousteau
who
was
ploughing
furrow
by
furrow
or
if
you
will
line
by
line
through
a
novel
for
a
periodical
dearest
heart
said
she
finish
your
novel
without
making
any
sacrifice
to
necessity
polish
the
style
work
up
the
i
have
played
the
fine
lady
too
long
i
am
going
to
be
the
housewife
and
attend
to
for
the
last
four
months
etienne
had
been
taking
dinah
to
the
cafe
riche
to
dine
every
day
a
corner
being
always
kept
for
them
the
countrywoman
was
in
dismay
at
being
told
that
five
hundred
francs
were
owing
for
the
last
fortnight
what
we
have
been
drinking
wine
at
six
francs
a
bottle
a
sole
costs
five
francs
and
twenty
centimes
for
a
roll
she
exclaimed
as
she
looked
through
the
bill
lousteau
showed
her
well
it
makes
very
little
difference
to
us
whether
we
are
robbed
at
a
restaurant
or
by
a
cook
said
lousteau
henceforth
for
the
cost
of
your
dinner
you
shall
live
like
a
having
induced
the
landlord
to
let
her
have
a
kitchen
and
two
servants
rooms
madame
de
la
baudraye
wrote
a
few
lines
to
her
mother
begging
her
to
send
her
some
linen
and
a
loan
of
a
thousand
francs
she
received
two
trunks
full
of
linen
some
plate
and
two
thousand
francs
sent
by
the
hand
of
an
honest
and
pious
cook
recommended
her
by
her
mother
ten
days
after
the
evening
at
the
theatre
when
they
had
met
monsieur
de
clagny
came
to
call
at
four
o
clock
after
coming
out
of
court
and
found
madame
de
la
baudraye
making
a
little
cap
the
sight
of
this
proud
and
ambitious
woman
whose
mind
was
so
accomplished
and
who
had
queened
it
so
well
at
the
chateau
d
anzy
now
condescending
to
household
cares
and
sewing
for
the
coming
infant
moved
the
poor
lawyer
who
had
just
left
the
bench
and
as
he
saw
the
pricks
on
one
of
the
taper
fingers
he
had
so
often
kissed
he
understood
that
madame
de
la
baudraye
was
not
merely
playing
at
this
maternal
task
in
the
course
of
this
first
interview
the
magistrate
saw
to
the
depths
of
dinah
s
soul
this
perspicacity
in
a
man
so
much
in
love
was
a
superhuman
effort
he
saw
that
didine
meant
to
be
the
journalist
s
guardian
spirit
and
lead
him
into
a
nobler
road
she
had
seen
that
the
difficulties
of
his
practical
life
were
due
to
some
moral
defects
between
two
beings
united
by
love
in
one
so
genuine
and
in
the
other
so
well
feigned
more
than
one
confidence
had
been
exchanged
in
the
course
of
four
months
notwithstanding
the
care
with
which
etienne
wrapped
up
his
true
self
a
word
now
and
then
had
not
failed
to
enlighten
dinah
as
to
the
previous
life
of
a
man
whose
talents
were
so
hampered
by
poverty
so
perverted
by
bad
examples
so
thwarted
by
obstacles
beyond
his
courage
to
surmount
he
will
be
a
greater
man
if
life
is
easy
to
him
said
she
to
herself
and
she
strove
to
make
him
happy
to
give
him
the
sense
of
a
sheltered
home
by
dint
of
such
economy
and
method
as
are
familiar
to
provincial
folks
thus
dinah
became
a
housekeeper
as
she
had
become
a
poet
by
the
soaring
of
her
soul
towards
the
heights
his
happiness
will
be
my
these
words
wrung
from
madame
de
la
baudraye
by
her
friend
the
lawyer
accounted
for
the
existing
state
of
things
the
publicity
of
his
triumph
flaunted
by
etienne
on
the
evening
of
the
first
performance
had
very
plainly
shown
the
lawyer
what
lousteau
s
purpose
was
to
etienne
madame
de
la
baudraye
was
to
use
his
own
phrase
a
fine
feather
in
his
far
from
preferring
the
joys
of
a
shy
and
mysterious
passion
of
hiding
such
exquisite
happiness
from
the
eyes
of
the
world
he
found
a
vulgar
satisfaction
in
displaying
the
first
woman
of
respectability
who
had
ever
honored
him
with
her
affection
the
judge
however
was
for
some
time
deceived
by
the
attentions
which
any
man
would
lavish
on
any
woman
in
madame
de
la
baudraye
s
situation
and
lousteau
made
them
doubly
charming
by
the
ingratiating
ways
characteristic
of
men
whose
manners
are
naturally
attractive
there
are
in
fact
men
who
have
something
of
the
monkey
in
them
by
nature
and
to
whom
the
assumption
of
the
most
engaging
forms
of
sentiment
is
so
easy
that
the
actor
is
not
detected
and
lousteau
s
natural
gifts
had
been
fully
developed
on
the
stage
on
which
he
had
hitherto
figured
between
the
months
of
april
and
july
when
dinah
expected
her
confinement
she
discovered
why
it
was
that
lousteau
had
not
triumphed
over
poverty
he
was
idle
and
had
no
power
of
will
the
brain
to
be
sure
must
obey
its
own
laws
it
recognizes
neither
the
exigencies
of
life
nor
the
voice
of
honor
a
man
can
not
write
a
great
book
because
a
woman
is
dying
or
to
pay
a
discreditable
debt
or
to
bring
up
a
family
at
the
same
time
there
is
no
great
talent
without
a
strong
will
these
twin
forces
are
requisite
for
the
erection
of
the
vast
edifice
of
personal
glory
a
distinguished
genius
keeps
his
brain
in
a
productive
condition
just
as
the
knights
of
old
kept
their
weapons
always
ready
for
battle
they
conquer
indolence
they
deny
themselves
enervating
pleasures
or
indulge
only
to
a
fixed
limit
proportioned
to
their
powers
this
explains
the
life
of
such
men
as
walter
scott
cuvier
voltaire
newton
buffon
bayle
bossuet
leibnitz
lopez
de
vega
calderon
boccacio
aretino
aristotle
in
short
every
man
who
delighted
governed
or
led
his
contemporaries
a
man
may
and
ought
to
pride
himself
more
on
his
will
than
on
his
talent
though
talent
has
its
germ
in
a
cultivated
gift
will
means
the
incessant
conquest
of
his
instincts
of
proclivities
subdued
and
mortified
and
difficulties
of
every
kind
heroically
defeated
the
abuse
of
smoking
encouraged
lousteau
s
indolence
tobacco
which
can
lull
grief
inevitably
numbs
a
man
s
energy
then
while
the
cigar
deteriorated
him
physically
criticism
as
a
profession
morally
stultified
a
man
so
easily
tempted
by
pleasure
criticism
is
as
fatal
to
the
critic
as
seeing
two
sides
to
a
question
is
to
a
pleader
in
these
professions
the
judgment
is
undermined
the
mind
loses
its
lucid
rectitude
the
writer
lives
by
taking
sides
thus
we
may
distinguish
two
kinds
of
criticism
as
in
painting
we
may
distinguish
art
from
practical
dexterity
criticism
after
the
pattern
of
most
contemporary
is
the
expression
of
judgments
formed
at
random
in
a
more
or
less
witty
way
just
as
an
advocate
pleads
in
court
on
the
most
contradictory
briefs
the
newspaper
critic
always
finds
a
subject
to
work
up
in
the
book
he
is
discussing
done
after
this
fashion
the
business
is
well
adapted
to
indolent
brains
to
men
devoid
of
the
sublime
faculty
of
imagination
or
possessed
of
it
indeed
but
lacking
courage
to
cultivate
it
every
play
every
book
comes
to
their
pen
as
a
subject
making
no
demand
on
their
imagination
and
of
which
they
simply
write
a
report
seriously
or
in
irony
according
to
the
mood
of
the
moment
as
to
an
opinion
whatever
it
may
be
french
wit
can
always
justify
it
being
admirably
ready
to
defend
either
side
of
any
case
and
conscience
counts
for
so
little
these
have
so
little
value
for
their
own
words
that
they
will
loudly
praise
in
the
greenroom
the
work
they
tear
to
tatters
in
print
nay
men
have
been
known
to
transfer
their
services
from
one
paper
to
another
without
being
at
the
pains
to
consider
that
the
opinions
of
the
new
sheet
must
be
diametrically
antagonistic
to
those
of
the
old
madame
de
la
baudraye
could
smile
to
see
lousteau
with
one
article
on
the
legitimist
side
and
one
on
the
side
of
the
new
dynasty
both
on
the
same
occasion
she
admired
the
maxim
he
preached
we
are
the
attorneys
of
public
the
other
kind
of
criticism
is
a
science
it
necessitates
a
thorough
comprehension
of
each
work
a
lucid
insight
into
the
tendencies
of
the
age
the
adoption
of
a
system
and
faith
in
fixed
principles
that
is
to
say
a
scheme
of
jurisprudence
a
and
a
verdict
the
critic
is
then
a
magistrate
of
ideas
the
censor
of
his
time
he
fulfils
a
sacred
function
while
in
the
former
case
he
is
but
an
acrobat
who
turns
somersaults
for
a
living
so
long
as
he
had
a
leg
to
stand
on
between
claude
vignon
and
lousteau
lay
the
gulf
that
divides
mere
dexterity
from
art
dinah
whose
mind
was
soon
freed
from
rust
and
whose
intellect
was
by
no
means
narrow
had
ere
long
taken
literary
measure
of
her
idol
she
saw
lousteau
working
up
to
the
last
minute
under
the
most
discreditable
compulsion
and
scamping
his
work
as
painters
say
of
a
picture
from
which
sound
technique
is
absent
but
she
would
excuse
him
by
saying
he
is
a
poet
so
anxious
was
she
to
justify
him
in
her
own
eyes
when
she
thus
guessed
the
secret
of
many
a
writer
s
existence
she
also
guessed
that
lousteau
s
pen
could
never
be
trusted
to
as
a
resource
then
her
love
for
him
led
her
to
take
a
step
she
would
never
had
thought
of
for
her
own
sake
through
her
mother
she
tried
to
negotiate
with
her
husband
for
an
allowance
but
without
etienne
s
knowledge
for
as
she
thought
it
would
be
an
offence
to
his
delicate
feelings
which
must
be
considered
a
few
days
before
the
end
of
july
dinah
crumbled
up
in
her
wrath
the
letter
from
her
mother
containing
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
s
ultimatum
madame
de
la
baudraye
can
not
need
an
allowance
in
paris
when
she
can
live
in
perfect
luxury
at
her
chateau
of
anzy
she
may
lousteau
picked
up
this
letter
and
read
it
i
will
avenge
you
said
he
to
dinah
in
the
ominous
tone
that
delights
a
woman
when
her
antipathies
are
flattered
five
days
after
this
bianchon
and
duriau
the
famous
ladies
doctor
were
engaged
at
lousteau
s
for
he
ever
since
little
la
baudraye
s
reply
had
been
making
a
great
display
of
his
joy
and
importance
over
the
advent
of
the
infant
monsieur
de
clagny
and
madame
piedefer
sent
for
in
all
haste
were
to
be
the
godparents
for
the
cautious
magistrate
feared
lest
lousteau
should
commit
some
compromising
blunder
madame
de
la
baudraye
gave
birth
to
a
boy
that
might
have
filled
a
queen
with
envy
who
hoped
for
an
bianchon
and
monsieur
de
clagny
went
off
to
register
the
child
at
the
mayor
s
office
as
the
son
of
monsieur
and
madame
de
la
baudraye
unknown
to
etienne
who
on
his
part
rushed
off
to
a
printer
s
to
have
this
circular
set
up
madame
la
baronne
de
la
baudraye
is
happily
delivered
of
a
monsieur
etienne
lousteau
has
the
pleasure
of
informing
you
of
the
the
mother
and
child
are
doing
lousteau
had
already
sent
out
sixty
of
these
announcements
when
monsieur
de
clagny
on
coming
to
make
inquiries
happened
to
see
the
list
of
persons
at
sancerre
to
whom
lousteau
proposed
to
send
this
amazing
notice
written
below
the
names
of
the
persons
in
paris
to
whom
it
was
already
gone
the
lawyer
confiscated
the
list
and
the
remainder
of
the
circulars
showed
them
to
madame
piedefer
begging
her
on
no
account
to
allow
lousteau
to
carry
on
this
atrocious
jest
and
jumped
into
a
cab
the
devoted
friend
then
ordered
from
the
same
printer
another
announcement
in
the
following
words
madame
la
baronne
de
la
baudraye
is
happily
delivered
of
a
monsieur
le
baron
de
la
baudraye
has
the
honor
of
informing
you
of
the
mother
and
child
are
doing
after
seeing
the
proofs
destroyed
the
form
of
type
everything
that
could
bear
witness
to
the
existence
of
the
former
document
monsieur
de
clagny
set
to
work
to
intercept
those
that
had
been
sent
in
many
cases
he
changed
them
at
the
porter
s
lodge
he
got
back
thirty
into
his
own
hands
and
at
last
after
three
days
of
hard
work
only
one
of
the
original
notes
existed
that
namely
sent
to
nathan
five
times
had
the
lawyer
called
on
the
great
man
without
finding
him
by
the
time
monsieur
de
clagny
was
admitted
after
requesting
an
interview
the
story
of
the
announcement
was
known
to
all
paris
some
persons
regarded
it
as
one
of
those
waggish
calumnies
a
sort
of
stab
to
which
every
reputation
even
the
most
ephemeral
is
exposed
others
said
they
had
read
the
paper
and
returned
it
to
some
friend
of
the
la
baudraye
family
a
great
many
declaimed
against
the
immorality
of
journalists
in
short
this
last
remaining
specimen
was
regarded
as
a
curiosity
florine
with
whom
nathan
was
living
had
shown
it
about
stamped
in
the
post
as
paid
and
addressed
in
etienne
s
hand
so
as
soon
as
the
judge
spoke
of
the
announcement
nathan
began
to
smile
give
up
that
monument
of
recklessness
and
folly
cried
he
that
autograph
is
one
of
those
weapons
which
an
athlete
in
the
circus
can
not
afford
to
lay
down
that
note
proves
that
lousteau
has
no
heart
no
taste
no
dignity
that
he
knows
nothing
of
the
world
nor
of
public
morality
that
he
insults
himself
when
he
can
find
no
one
else
to
none
but
the
son
of
a
provincial
citizen
imported
from
sancerre
to
become
a
poet
but
who
is
only
the
of
some
contemptible
magazine
could
ever
have
sent
out
such
a
circular
letter
as
you
must
allow
monsieur
this
is
a
document
indispensable
to
the
archives
of
the
lousteau
flatters
me
he
may
ask
for
my
excuse
me
i
forgot
you
were
a
judge
i
have
gone
through
a
passion
for
a
lady
a
great
lady
as
far
superior
to
madame
de
la
baudraye
as
your
fine
feeling
monsieur
is
superior
to
lousteau
s
vulgar
retaliation
but
i
would
have
died
rather
than
utter
her
name
a
few
months
of
her
airs
and
graces
cost
me
a
hundred
thousand
francs
and
my
prospects
for
life
but
i
do
not
think
the
price
too
high
and
i
have
never
murmured
if
a
woman
betrays
the
secret
of
her
passion
it
is
the
supreme
offering
of
her
love
but
a
man
he
must
be
a
lousteau
no
i
would
not
give
up
that
paper
for
a
thousand
monsieur
said
the
lawyer
at
last
after
an
eloquent
battle
lasting
half
an
hour
i
have
called
on
fifteen
or
sixteen
men
of
letters
about
this
affair
and
can
it
be
that
you
are
the
only
one
immovable
by
an
appeal
of
honor
it
is
not
for
etienne
lousteau
that
i
plead
but
for
a
woman
and
child
both
equally
ignorant
of
the
damage
done
to
their
fortune
their
prospects
and
their
who
knows
monsieur
whether
you
might
not
some
day
be
compelled
to
plead
for
some
favor
of
justice
for
a
friend
for
some
person
whose
honor
was
dearer
to
you
than
your
it
might
be
remembered
against
you
that
you
had
been
can
such
a
man
as
you
are
hesitate
added
monsieur
de
clagny
i
only
wished
you
to
understand
the
extent
of
the
sacrifice
replied
nathan
giving
up
the
letter
as
he
reflected
on
the
judge
s
influence
and
accepted
this
implied
bargain
when
the
journalist
s
stupid
jest
had
been
counteracted
monsieur
de
clagny
went
to
give
him
a
rating
in
the
presence
of
madame
piedefer
but
he
found
lousteau
fuming
with
irritation
what
i
did
monsieur
i
did
with
a
purpose
replied
etienne
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
has
sixty
thousand
francs
a
year
and
refuses
to
make
his
wife
an
allowance
i
wished
to
make
him
feel
that
the
child
is
in
my
yes
monsieur
i
quite
suspected
it
replied
the
lawyer
for
that
reason
i
readily
agreed
to
be
little
polydore
s
godfather
and
he
is
registered
as
the
son
of
the
baron
and
baronne
de
la
baudraye
if
you
have
the
feelings
of
a
father
you
ought
to
rejoice
in
knowing
that
the
child
is
heir
to
one
of
the
finest
entailed
estates
in
and
pray
sir
is
the
mother
to
die
of
hunger
be
quite
easy
said
the
lawyer
bitterly
having
dragged
from
lousteau
the
expression
of
feeling
he
had
so
long
been
expecting
i
will
undertake
to
transact
the
matter
with
monsieur
de
la
monsieur
de
clagny
left
the
house
with
a
chill
at
his
heart
dinah
his
idol
was
loved
for
her
money
would
she
not
when
too
late
have
her
eyes
opened
poor
woman
said
the
lawyer
as
he
walked
away
and
this
justice
we
will
do
him
for
to
whom
should
justice
be
done
unless
to
a
judge
he
loved
dinah
too
sincerely
to
regard
her
degradation
as
a
means
of
triumph
one
day
he
was
all
pity
and
devotion
he
really
loved
her
the
care
and
nursing
of
the
infant
its
cries
the
quiet
needed
for
the
mother
during
the
first
few
days
and
the
ubiquity
of
madame
piedefer
were
so
entirely
adverse
to
literary
labors
that
lousteau
moved
up
to
the
three
rooms
taken
on
the
first
floor
for
the
old
bigot
the
journalist
obliged
to
go
to
the
first
performances
without
dinah
and
living
apart
from
her
found
an
indescribable
charm
in
the
use
of
his
liberty
more
than
once
he
submitted
to
be
taken
by
the
arm
and
dragged
off
to
some
jollification
more
than
once
he
found
himself
at
the
house
of
a
friend
s
mistress
in
the
heart
of
bohemia
he
again
saw
women
brilliantly
young
and
splendidly
dressed
in
whom
economy
seemed
treason
to
their
youth
and
power
dinah
in
spite
of
her
striking
beauty
after
nursing
her
baby
for
three
months
could
not
stand
comparison
with
these
perishable
blossoms
so
soon
faded
but
so
showy
as
long
as
they
live
rooted
in
opulence
home
life
had
nevertheless
a
strong
attraction
for
etienne
in
three
months
the
mother
and
daughter
with
the
help
of
the
cook
from
sancerre
and
of
little
pamela
had
given
the
apartment
a
quite
changed
appearance
the
journalist
found
his
breakfast
and
his
dinner
served
with
a
sort
of
luxury
dinah
handsome
and
nicely
dressed
was
careful
to
anticipate
her
dear
etienne
s
wishes
and
he
felt
himself
the
king
of
his
home
where
everything
even
the
baby
was
subject
to
his
selfishness
dinah
s
affection
was
to
be
seen
in
every
trifle
lousteau
could
not
possibly
cease
the
entrancing
deceptions
of
his
unreal
passion
dinah
meanwhile
was
aware
of
a
source
of
ruin
both
to
her
love
and
to
the
household
in
the
kind
of
life
into
which
lousteau
had
allowed
himself
to
drift
at
the
end
of
ten
months
she
weaned
her
baby
installed
her
mother
in
the
upstairs
rooms
and
restored
the
family
intimacy
which
indissolubly
links
a
man
and
woman
when
the
woman
is
loving
and
clever
one
of
the
most
striking
circumstances
in
benjamin
constant
s
novel
one
of
the
explanations
of
ellenore
s
desertion
is
the
want
of
daily
or
if
you
will
of
nightly
intercourse
between
her
and
adolphe
each
of
the
lovers
has
a
separate
home
they
have
both
submitted
to
the
world
and
saved
appearances
ellenore
repeatedly
left
to
herself
is
compelled
to
vast
labors
of
affection
to
expel
the
thoughts
of
release
which
captivate
adolphe
when
absent
the
constant
exchange
of
glances
and
thoughts
in
domestic
life
gives
a
woman
such
power
that
a
man
needs
stronger
reasons
for
desertion
than
she
will
ever
give
him
so
long
as
she
loves
him
this
was
an
entirely
new
phase
both
to
etienne
and
to
dinah
dinah
intended
to
be
indispensable
she
wanted
to
infuse
fresh
energy
into
this
man
whose
weakness
smiled
upon
her
for
she
thought
it
a
security
she
found
him
subjects
sketched
the
treatment
and
at
a
pinch
would
write
whole
chapters
she
revived
the
vitality
of
this
dying
talent
by
transfusing
fresh
blood
into
his
veins
she
supplied
him
with
ideas
and
opinions
in
short
she
produced
two
books
which
were
a
success
more
than
once
she
saved
lousteau
s
by
dictating
correcting
or
finishing
his
articles
when
he
was
in
despair
at
his
own
lack
of
ideas
the
secret
of
this
collaboration
was
strictly
preserved
madame
piedefer
knew
nothing
of
it
this
mental
galvanism
was
rewarded
by
improved
pay
enabling
them
to
live
comfortably
till
the
end
of
lousteau
became
used
to
seeing
dinah
do
his
work
and
he
paid
her
as
the
french
people
say
in
their
vigorous
lingo
in
monkey
money
nothing
for
her
pains
this
expenditure
in
becomes
a
treasure
which
generous
souls
prize
and
the
more
she
gave
the
more
she
loved
lousteau
the
time
soon
came
when
dinah
felt
that
it
would
be
too
bitter
a
grief
ever
to
give
him
up
but
then
another
child
was
coming
and
this
year
was
a
terrible
trial
in
spite
of
the
precautions
of
the
two
women
etienne
contracted
debts
he
worked
himself
to
death
to
pay
them
off
while
dinah
was
laid
up
and
knowing
him
as
she
did
she
thought
him
heroic
but
after
this
effort
appalled
at
having
two
women
two
children
and
two
maids
on
his
hands
he
was
incapable
of
the
struggle
to
maintain
a
family
by
his
pen
when
he
had
failed
to
maintain
even
himself
so
he
let
things
take
their
chance
then
the
ruthless
speculator
exaggerated
the
farce
of
at
home
to
secure
greater
liberty
abroad
dinah
proudly
endured
the
burden
of
life
without
support
the
one
idea
he
loves
me
gave
her
superhuman
strength
she
worked
as
hard
as
the
most
energetic
spirits
of
our
time
at
the
risk
of
her
beauty
and
health
didine
was
to
lousteau
what
mademoiselle
delachaux
was
to
gardane
in
diderot
s
noble
and
true
tale
but
while
sacrificing
herself
she
committed
the
magnanimous
blunder
of
sacrificing
dress
she
had
her
gowns
dyed
and
wore
nothing
but
black
she
stank
of
black
as
malaga
said
making
fun
mercilessly
of
lousteau
by
the
end
of
etienne
following
the
example
of
louis
had
by
dint
of
gradual
capitulations
of
conscience
come
to
the
point
of
establishing
a
distinction
between
his
own
money
and
the
housekeeping
money
just
as
louis
xv
drew
the
line
between
his
privy
purse
and
the
public
moneys
he
deceived
dinah
as
to
his
earnings
on
discovering
this
baseness
madame
de
la
baudraye
went
through
fearful
tortures
of
jealousy
she
wanted
to
live
two
lives
the
life
of
the
world
and
the
life
of
a
literary
woman
she
accompanied
lousteau
to
every
performance
and
could
detect
in
him
many
impulses
of
wounded
vanity
for
her
black
attire
rubbed
off
as
it
were
on
him
clouding
his
brow
and
sometimes
leading
him
to
be
quite
brutal
he
was
really
the
woman
of
the
two
and
he
had
all
a
woman
s
exacting
perversity
he
would
reproach
dinah
for
the
dowdiness
of
her
appearance
even
while
benefiting
by
the
sacrifice
which
to
a
mistress
is
so
cruel
exactly
like
a
woman
who
after
sending
a
man
through
a
gutter
to
save
her
honor
tells
him
she
can
not
bear
dirt
when
he
comes
out
dinah
then
found
herself
obliged
to
gather
up
the
rather
loose
reins
of
power
by
which
a
clever
woman
drives
a
man
devoid
of
will
but
in
so
doing
she
could
not
fail
to
lose
much
of
her
moral
lustre
such
suspicions
as
she
betrayed
drag
a
woman
into
quarrels
which
lead
to
disrespect
because
she
herself
comes
down
from
the
high
level
on
which
she
had
at
first
placed
herself
next
she
made
some
concession
lousteau
was
allowed
to
entertain
several
of
his
friends
nathan
bixiou
blondet
finot
whose
manners
language
and
intercourse
were
depraving
they
tried
to
convince
madame
de
la
baudraye
that
her
principles
and
aversions
were
a
survival
of
provincial
prudishness
and
they
preached
the
creed
of
woman
s
superiority
before
long
her
jealousy
put
weapons
into
lousteau
s
hands
during
the
carnival
of
she
disguised
herself
to
go
to
the
balls
at
the
and
to
suppers
where
she
met
courtesans
in
order
to
keep
an
eye
on
all
etienne
s
amusements
on
the
day
of
or
rather
at
eight
on
the
morning
after
dinah
came
home
from
the
ball
in
her
fancy
dress
to
go
to
bed
she
had
gone
to
spy
on
lousteau
who
believing
her
to
be
ill
had
engaged
himself
for
that
evening
to
fanny
beaupre
the
journalist
warned
by
a
friend
had
behaved
so
as
to
deceive
the
poor
woman
only
too
ready
to
be
deceived
as
she
stepped
out
of
the
hired
cab
dinah
met
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
to
whom
the
porter
pointed
her
out
the
little
old
man
took
his
wife
by
the
arm
saying
in
an
icy
tone
so
this
is
you
madame
this
sudden
advent
of
conjugal
authority
before
which
she
felt
herself
so
small
and
above
all
these
words
almost
froze
the
heart
of
the
unhappy
woman
caught
in
the
costume
of
a
to
escape
etienne
s
eye
the
more
effectually
she
had
chosen
a
dress
he
was
not
likely
to
detect
her
in
she
took
advantage
of
the
mask
she
still
had
on
to
escape
without
replying
changed
her
dress
and
went
up
to
her
mother
s
rooms
where
she
found
her
husband
waiting
for
her
in
spite
of
her
assumed
dignity
she
blushed
in
the
old
man
s
presence
what
do
you
want
of
me
monsieur
she
asked
are
we
not
separated
forever
actually
yes
said
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
legally
madame
piedefer
was
telegraphing
signals
to
her
daughter
which
dinah
presently
observed
and
understood
nothing
could
have
brought
you
here
but
your
own
interests
she
said
in
a
bitter
tone
interests
said
the
little
man
coldly
for
we
have
two
your
uncle
silas
piedefer
is
dead
at
new
york
where
after
having
made
and
lost
several
fortunes
in
various
parts
of
the
world
he
has
finally
left
some
seven
or
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
they
say
twelve
but
there
is
to
be
sold
i
am
the
chief
in
our
common
interests
and
act
for
oh
cried
dinah
in
everything
that
relates
to
business
i
trust
no
one
but
monsieur
de
clagny
he
knows
the
law
come
to
terms
with
him
what
he
does
will
be
done
i
have
no
occasion
for
monsieur
de
clagny
answered
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
to
take
my
children
from
you
your
children
exclaimed
dinah
your
children
to
whom
you
have
not
sent
a
sou
children
she
burst
into
a
loud
shout
of
laughter
but
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
s
unmoved
coolness
threw
ice
on
the
explosion
your
mother
has
just
brought
them
to
show
me
he
went
on
they
are
charming
boys
i
do
not
intend
to
part
from
them
i
shall
take
them
to
our
house
at
anzy
if
it
were
only
to
save
them
from
seeing
their
mother
disguised
like
a
silence
said
madame
de
la
baudraye
imperatively
what
do
you
want
of
me
that
brought
you
here
a
power
of
attorney
to
receive
our
uncle
silas
dinah
took
a
pen
wrote
two
lines
to
monsieur
de
clagny
and
desired
her
husband
to
call
again
in
the
afternoon
at
five
o
clock
monsieur
de
clagny
who
had
been
promoted
to
the
post
of
enlightened
madame
de
la
baudraye
as
to
her
position
still
he
undertook
to
arrange
everything
by
a
bargain
with
the
old
fellow
whose
visit
had
been
prompted
by
avarice
alone
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
to
whom
his
wife
s
power
of
attorney
was
indispensable
to
enable
him
to
deal
with
the
business
as
he
wished
purchased
it
by
certain
concessions
in
the
first
place
he
undertook
to
allow
her
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
so
long
as
she
found
it
convenient
so
the
document
was
worded
to
reside
in
paris
the
children
each
on
attaining
the
age
of
six
were
to
be
placed
in
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
s
keeping
finally
the
lawyer
extracted
the
payment
of
the
allowance
in
advance
little
la
baudraye
who
came
jauntily
enough
to
say
to
his
wife
and
children
appeared
in
a
white
overcoat
he
was
so
firm
on
his
feet
and
so
exactly
like
the
la
baudraye
of
that
dinah
despaired
of
ever
burying
the
dreadful
little
dwarf
from
the
garden
where
he
was
smoking
a
cigar
the
journalist
could
watch
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
for
so
long
as
it
took
the
little
reptile
to
cross
the
forecourt
but
that
was
enough
for
lousteau
it
was
plain
to
him
that
the
little
man
had
intended
to
wreck
every
hope
of
his
dying
that
his
wife
might
have
conceived
this
short
scene
made
a
considerable
change
in
the
writer
s
secret
scheming
as
he
smoked
a
second
cigar
he
seriously
reviewed
the
position
his
life
with
madame
de
la
baudraye
had
hitherto
cost
him
quite
as
much
as
it
had
cost
her
to
use
the
language
of
business
the
two
sides
of
the
account
balanced
and
they
could
if
necessary
cry
quits
considering
how
small
his
income
was
and
how
hardly
he
earned
it
lousteau
regarded
himself
morally
speaking
as
the
creditor
it
was
no
doubt
a
favorable
moment
for
throwing
the
woman
over
tired
at
the
end
of
three
years
of
playing
a
comedy
which
never
can
become
a
habit
he
was
perpetually
concealing
his
weariness
and
this
fellow
who
was
accustomed
to
disguise
none
of
his
feelings
compelled
himself
to
wear
a
smile
at
home
like
that
of
a
debtor
in
the
presence
of
his
creditor
this
compulsion
was
every
day
more
intolerable
hitherto
the
immense
advantages
he
foresaw
in
the
future
had
given
him
strength
but
when
he
saw
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
embark
for
the
united
states
as
briskly
as
if
it
were
to
go
down
to
rouen
in
a
steamboat
he
ceased
to
believe
in
the
future
he
went
in
from
the
garden
to
the
pretty
where
dinah
had
just
taken
leave
of
her
husband
etienne
said
madame
de
la
baudraye
do
you
know
what
my
lord
and
master
has
proposed
to
me
in
the
event
of
my
wishing
to
return
to
live
at
anzy
during
his
absence
he
has
left
his
orders
and
he
hopes
that
my
mother
s
good
advice
will
weigh
with
me
and
that
i
shall
go
back
there
with
my
it
is
very
good
advice
replied
lousteau
drily
knowing
the
passionate
disclaimer
that
dinah
expected
and
indeed
begged
for
with
her
eyes
the
tone
the
words
the
cold
look
all
hit
the
hapless
woman
so
hard
who
lived
only
in
her
love
that
two
large
tears
trickled
slowly
down
her
cheeks
while
she
did
not
speak
a
word
and
lousteau
only
saw
them
when
she
took
out
her
handkerchief
to
wipe
away
these
two
beads
of
anguish
what
is
it
didine
he
asked
touched
to
the
heart
by
this
excessive
sensibility
just
as
i
was
priding
myself
on
having
won
our
freedom
said
she
at
the
cost
of
my
fortune
by
selling
what
is
most
precious
to
a
mother
s
heart
selling
my
children
for
he
is
to
have
them
from
the
age
of
six
and
i
can
not
see
them
without
going
to
sancerre
and
that
is
torture
ah
dear
god
what
have
i
done
lousteau
knelt
down
by
her
and
kissed
her
hands
with
a
lavish
display
of
coaxing
and
petting
you
do
not
understand
me
said
he
i
blame
myself
for
i
am
not
worth
such
sacrifices
dear
angel
i
am
in
a
literary
sense
a
quite
man
if
the
day
comes
when
i
can
no
longer
cut
a
figure
at
the
bottom
of
the
newspaper
the
editors
will
let
me
lie
like
an
old
shoe
flung
into
the
rubbish
heap
remember
we
dancers
have
no
retiring
pension
the
state
would
have
too
many
clever
men
on
its
hands
if
it
started
on
such
a
career
of
beneficence
i
am
and
i
am
as
idle
as
a
marmot
i
feel
it
i
know
it
and
he
took
her
by
the
hand
my
love
can
only
be
fatal
to
you
as
you
know
at
i
lived
on
florine
but
what
is
excusable
in
a
youth
what
then
seems
smart
and
charming
is
a
disgrace
to
a
man
of
forty
hitherto
we
have
shared
the
burden
of
existence
and
it
has
not
been
lovely
for
this
year
and
half
out
of
devotion
to
me
you
wear
nothing
but
black
and
that
does
me
no
dinah
gave
one
of
those
magnanimous
shrugs
which
are
worth
all
the
words
ever
yes
etienne
went
on
i
know
you
sacrifice
everything
to
my
whims
even
your
beauty
and
i
with
a
heart
worn
out
in
past
struggles
a
soul
full
of
dark
presentiments
as
to
the
future
i
can
not
repay
your
exquisite
love
with
an
equal
affection
we
were
very
happy
without
a
cloud
for
a
long
well
then
i
can
not
bear
to
see
so
sweet
a
poem
end
badly
am
i
wrong
madame
de
la
baudraye
loved
etienne
so
truly
that
this
prudence
worthy
of
de
clagny
gratified
her
and
stanched
her
tears
he
loves
me
for
myself
alone
thought
she
looking
at
him
with
smiling
eyes
after
four
years
of
intimacy
this
woman
s
love
now
combined
every
shade
of
affection
which
our
powers
of
analysis
can
discern
and
which
modern
society
has
created
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
of
our
age
whose
death
is
a
recent
loss
to
the
world
of
letters
beyle
stendhal
was
the
first
to
delineate
them
to
perfection
lousteau
could
produce
in
dinah
the
acute
agitation
which
may
be
compared
to
magnetism
that
upsets
every
power
of
the
mind
and
body
and
overcomes
every
instinct
of
resistance
in
a
woman
a
look
from
him
or
his
hand
laid
on
hers
reduced
her
to
implicit
obedience
a
kind
word
or
a
smile
wreathed
the
poor
woman
s
soul
with
flowers
a
fond
look
elated
a
cold
look
depressed
her
when
she
walked
taking
his
arm
and
keeping
step
with
him
in
the
street
or
on
the
boulevard
she
was
so
entirely
absorbed
in
him
that
she
lost
all
sense
of
herself
fascinated
by
this
fellow
s
wit
magnetized
by
his
airs
his
vices
were
but
trivial
defects
in
her
eyes
she
loved
the
puffs
of
cigar
smoke
that
the
wind
brought
into
her
room
from
the
garden
she
went
to
inhale
them
and
made
no
wry
faces
hiding
herself
to
enjoy
them
she
hated
the
publisher
or
the
newspaper
editor
who
refused
lousteau
money
on
the
ground
of
the
enormous
advances
he
had
had
already
she
deluded
herself
so
far
as
to
believe
that
her
bohemian
was
writing
a
novel
for
which
the
payment
was
to
come
instead
of
working
off
a
debt
long
since
incurred
this
no
doubt
is
true
love
and
includes
every
mode
of
loving
the
love
of
the
heart
and
of
the
head
passion
caprice
and
taste
to
accept
beyle
s
definitions
didine
loved
him
so
wholly
that
in
certain
moments
when
her
critical
judgment
just
by
nature
and
constantly
exercised
since
she
had
lived
in
paris
compelled
her
to
read
to
the
bottom
of
lousteau
s
soul
sense
was
still
too
much
for
reason
and
suggested
excuses
and
what
am
i
she
replied
a
woman
who
has
put
herself
outside
the
pale
since
i
have
sacrificed
all
a
woman
s
honor
why
should
you
not
sacrifice
to
me
some
of
a
man
s
honor
do
we
not
live
outside
the
limits
of
social
conventionality
why
not
accept
from
me
what
nathan
can
accept
from
florine
we
will
square
accounts
when
we
part
and
only
death
can
part
us
you
know
my
happiness
is
your
honor
etienne
as
my
constancy
and
your
happiness
are
mine
if
i
fail
to
make
you
happy
all
is
at
an
end
if
i
cause
you
a
pang
condemn
me
our
debts
are
paid
we
have
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
and
between
us
we
can
certainly
make
eight
thousand
francs
a
year
i
will
write
theatrical
with
fifteen
hundred
francs
a
month
we
shall
be
as
rich
as
be
quite
easy
i
will
have
some
lovely
dresses
and
give
you
every
day
some
gratified
vanity
as
on
the
first
night
of
nathan
s
play
and
what
about
your
mother
who
goes
to
mass
every
day
and
wants
to
bring
a
priest
to
the
house
and
make
you
give
up
this
way
of
life
every
one
has
a
pet
vice
you
smoke
she
preaches
at
me
poor
woman
but
she
takes
great
care
of
the
children
she
takes
them
out
she
is
absolutely
devoted
and
idolizes
me
would
you
hinder
her
from
crying
what
will
be
thought
of
me
but
we
do
not
live
for
the
world
cried
she
raising
etienne
and
making
him
sit
by
her
besides
we
shall
be
married
some
day
we
have
the
risks
of
a
sea
voyage
i
never
thought
of
that
said
lousteau
simply
and
he
added
to
himself
time
enough
to
part
when
little
la
baudraye
is
safe
back
from
that
day
forth
etienne
lived
in
luxury
and
dinah
on
first
nights
could
hold
her
own
with
the
best
dressed
women
in
paris
lousteau
was
so
fatuous
as
to
affect
among
his
friends
the
attitude
of
a
man
overborne
bored
to
extinction
ruined
by
madame
de
la
baudraye
oh
what
would
i
not
give
to
the
friend
who
would
deliver
me
from
dinah
but
no
one
ever
can
said
he
she
loves
me
enough
to
throw
herself
out
of
the
window
if
i
told
the
journalist
was
duly
pitied
he
would
take
precautions
against
dinah
s
jealousy
when
he
accepted
an
invitation
and
then
he
was
shamelessly
unfaithful
monsieur
de
clagny
really
in
despair
at
seeing
dinah
in
such
disgraceful
circumstances
when
she
might
have
been
so
rich
and
in
so
wretched
a
position
at
the
time
when
her
original
ambitions
would
have
been
fulfilled
came
to
warn
her
to
tell
her
you
are
betrayed
and
she
only
replied
i
know
the
lawyer
was
silenced
still
he
found
his
tongue
to
say
one
thing
madame
de
la
baudraye
interrupted
him
when
he
had
scarcely
spoken
a
word
do
you
still
love
me
she
asked
i
would
lose
my
soul
for
you
he
exclaimed
starting
to
his
feet
the
hapless
man
s
eyes
flashed
like
torches
he
trembled
like
a
leaf
his
throat
was
rigid
his
hair
thrilled
to
the
roots
he
believed
he
was
so
blessed
as
to
be
accepted
as
his
idol
s
avenger
and
this
poor
joy
filled
him
with
rapture
why
are
you
so
startled
said
she
making
him
sit
down
again
that
is
how
i
love
the
lawyer
understood
this
argument
and
there
were
tears
in
the
eyes
of
the
judge
who
had
just
condemned
a
man
to
death
lousteau
s
satiety
that
odious
conclusion
of
such
illicit
relations
had
betrayed
itself
in
a
thousand
little
things
which
are
like
grains
of
sand
thrown
against
the
panes
of
the
little
magical
hut
where
those
who
love
dwell
and
dream
these
grains
of
sand
which
grow
to
be
pebbles
had
never
been
discerned
by
dinah
till
they
were
as
big
as
rocks
madame
de
la
baudraye
had
at
last
thoroughly
understood
lousteau
s
character
he
is
she
said
to
her
mother
a
poet
defenceless
against
disaster
mean
out
of
laziness
not
for
want
of
heart
and
rather
too
prone
to
pleasure
in
short
a
great
cat
whom
it
is
impossible
to
hate
what
would
become
of
him
without
me
i
hindered
his
marriage
he
has
no
prospects
his
talent
would
perish
in
oh
my
dinah
madame
piedefer
had
exclaimed
what
a
hell
you
live
in
what
is
the
feeling
that
gives
you
strength
enough
to
persist
i
will
be
a
mother
to
him
she
had
replied
there
are
certain
horrible
situations
in
which
we
come
to
no
decision
till
the
moment
when
our
friends
discern
our
dishonor
we
accept
compromises
with
ourself
so
long
as
we
escape
a
censor
who
comes
to
play
prosecutor
monsieur
de
clagny
as
clumsy
as
a
tortured
man
had
been
torturing
dinah
to
preserve
my
love
i
will
be
all
that
madame
de
pompadour
was
to
preserve
her
power
said
she
to
herself
when
monsieur
de
clagny
had
left
her
and
this
phrase
sufficiently
proves
that
her
love
was
becoming
a
burden
to
her
and
would
presently
be
a
toil
rather
than
a
pleasure
the
part
now
assumed
by
dinah
was
horribly
painful
and
lousteau
made
it
no
easier
to
play
when
he
wanted
to
go
out
after
dinner
he
would
perform
the
tenderest
little
farces
of
affection
and
address
dinah
in
words
full
of
devotion
he
would
take
her
by
the
chain
and
when
he
had
bruised
her
with
it
even
while
he
hurt
her
the
lordly
ingrate
would
say
did
i
wound
you
these
false
caresses
and
deceptions
had
degrading
consequences
for
dinah
who
believed
in
a
revival
of
his
love
the
mother
alas
gave
way
to
the
mistress
with
shameful
readiness
she
felt
herself
a
mere
plaything
in
the
man
s
hands
and
at
last
she
confessed
to
herself
well
then
i
will
be
his
plaything
finding
joy
in
it
the
rapture
of
damnation
when
this
woman
of
a
really
manly
spirit
pictured
herself
as
living
in
solitude
she
felt
her
courage
fail
she
preferred
the
anticipated
and
inevitable
miseries
of
this
fierce
intimacy
to
the
absence
of
the
joys
which
were
all
the
more
exquisite
because
they
arose
from
the
midst
of
remorse
of
terrible
struggles
with
herself
of
a
persuaded
to
be
at
every
moment
she
seemed
to
come
across
the
pool
of
bitter
water
found
in
a
desert
and
drunk
with
greater
relish
than
the
traveler
would
find
in
sipping
the
finest
wines
at
a
prince
s
table
when
dinah
wondered
to
herself
at
midnight
will
he
come
home
or
will
he
not
she
was
not
alive
again
till
she
heard
the
familiar
sound
of
lousteau
s
boots
and
his
ring
at
the
bell
she
would
often
try
to
restrain
him
by
giving
him
pleasure
she
would
hope
to
be
a
match
for
her
rivals
and
leave
them
no
hold
on
that
agitated
heart
how
many
times
a
day
would
she
rehearse
the
tragedy
of
dernier
jour
d
un
saying
to
herself
we
and
how
often
would
a
word
a
look
a
kiss
full
of
apparently
artless
feeling
bring
her
back
to
the
depths
of
her
love
it
was
terrible
more
than
once
had
she
meditated
suicide
as
she
paced
the
little
town
garden
where
a
few
pale
flowers
bloomed
in
fact
she
had
not
yet
exhausted
the
vast
treasure
of
devotion
and
love
which
a
loving
woman
bears
in
her
heart
the
romance
of
was
her
bible
her
study
for
above
all
else
she
would
not
be
an
ellenore
she
allowed
herself
no
tears
she
avoided
all
the
bitterness
so
cleverly
described
by
the
critic
to
whom
we
owe
an
analysis
of
this
striking
work
whose
comments
indeed
seemed
to
dinah
almost
superior
to
the
book
and
she
read
again
and
again
this
fine
essay
by
the
only
real
critic
who
has
written
in
the
des
deux
an
article
now
printed
at
the
beginning
of
the
new
edition
of
no
she
would
say
to
herself
as
she
repeated
the
author
s
fateful
words
no
i
will
not
give
my
requests
the
form
of
an
order
i
will
not
fly
to
tears
as
a
means
of
revenge
i
will
not
condemn
the
things
i
once
approved
without
reservation
i
will
not
dog
his
footsteps
with
a
prying
eye
if
he
plays
truant
he
shall
not
on
his
return
see
a
scornful
lip
whose
kiss
is
an
unanswerable
no
my
silence
shall
not
be
a
reproach
nor
my
first
word
a
i
will
not
be
like
every
other
woman
she
went
on
laying
on
her
table
the
little
yellow
paper
volume
which
had
already
attracted
lousteau
s
remark
what
are
you
studying
if
for
one
day
only
he
should
recognize
my
merits
and
say
that
victim
never
uttered
a
cry
it
will
be
all
i
ask
and
besides
the
others
only
have
him
for
an
hour
i
have
him
for
life
thinking
himself
justified
by
his
private
tribunal
in
punishing
his
wife
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
robbed
her
to
achieve
his
cherished
enterprise
of
reclaiming
three
thousand
acres
of
moorland
to
which
he
had
devoted
himself
ever
since
living
like
a
mouse
he
manipulated
the
property
left
by
monsieur
silas
piedefer
so
ingeniously
that
he
contrived
to
reduce
the
proved
value
to
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
while
pocketing
twelve
hundred
thousand
he
did
not
announce
his
return
but
while
his
wife
was
enduring
unspeakable
woes
he
was
building
farms
digging
trenches
and
ploughing
rough
ground
with
a
courage
that
ranked
him
among
the
most
remarkable
agriculturists
of
the
province
the
four
hundred
thousand
francs
he
had
filched
from
his
wife
were
spent
in
three
years
on
this
undertaking
and
the
estate
of
anzy
was
expected
to
return
thousand
francs
a
year
of
net
profits
after
the
taxes
were
paid
the
eight
hundred
thousand
he
invested
at
four
and
a
half
per
cent
in
the
funds
buying
at
eighty
francs
at
the
time
of
the
financial
crisis
brought
about
by
the
ministry
of
the
first
of
march
as
it
was
called
by
thus
securing
to
his
wife
an
income
of
thousand
francs
he
considered
himself
no
longer
in
her
debt
could
he
not
restore
the
odd
twelve
hundred
thousand
as
soon
as
the
four
and
a
half
per
cents
had
risen
above
a
hundred
he
was
now
the
greatest
man
in
sancerre
with
the
exception
of
one
the
richest
proprietor
in
france
whose
rival
he
considered
himself
he
saw
himself
with
an
income
of
a
hundred
and
forty
thousand
francs
of
which
ninety
thousand
formed
the
revenue
from
the
lands
he
had
entailed
having
calculated
that
besides
this
net
income
he
paid
ten
thousand
francs
in
taxes
three
thousand
in
working
expenses
ten
thousand
to
his
wife
and
twelve
hundred
to
his
he
would
say
in
the
literary
circles
of
sancerre
i
am
reputed
miserly
and
said
to
spend
nothing
but
my
outlay
amounts
to
thousand
five
hundred
francs
a
year
and
i
have
still
to
pay
for
the
education
of
my
two
children
i
daresay
it
is
not
a
pleasing
fact
to
the
milauds
of
nevers
but
the
second
house
of
la
baudraye
may
yet
have
as
noble
a
center
as
the
i
shall
most
likely
go
to
paris
and
petition
the
king
of
the
french
to
grant
me
the
title
of
count
monsieur
roy
is
a
count
and
my
wife
would
be
pleased
to
be
madame
la
and
this
was
said
with
such
splendid
coolness
that
no
one
would
have
dared
to
laugh
at
the
little
man
only
monsieur
boirouge
the
presiding
judge
remarked
in
your
place
i
should
not
be
happy
unless
i
had
a
well
i
shall
go
to
paris
before
long
said
the
baron
in
the
early
part
of
madame
de
la
baudraye
feeling
that
she
was
to
lousteau
no
more
than
a
reserve
in
the
background
had
again
sacrificed
herself
absolutely
to
secure
his
comfort
she
had
resumed
her
black
raiment
but
now
it
was
in
sign
of
mourning
for
her
pleasure
was
turning
to
remorse
she
was
too
often
put
to
shame
not
to
feel
the
weight
of
the
chain
and
her
mother
found
her
sunk
in
those
moods
of
meditation
into
which
visions
of
the
future
cast
unhappy
souls
in
a
sort
of
torpor
madame
piedefer
by
the
advice
of
her
spiritual
director
was
on
the
watch
for
the
moment
of
exhaustion
which
the
priest
told
her
would
inevitably
supervene
and
then
she
pleaded
in
behalf
of
the
children
she
restricted
herself
to
urging
that
dinah
and
lousteau
should
live
apart
not
asking
her
to
give
him
up
in
real
life
these
violent
situations
are
not
closed
as
they
are
in
books
by
death
or
cleverly
contrived
catastrophes
they
end
far
less
poetically
in
disgust
in
the
blighting
of
every
flower
of
the
soul
in
the
commonplace
of
habit
and
very
often
too
in
another
passion
which
robs
a
wife
of
the
interest
which
is
traditionally
ascribed
to
women
so
when
common
sense
the
law
of
social
proprieties
family
interest
all
the
mixed
elements
which
since
the
restoration
have
been
dignified
by
the
mane
of
public
morals
out
of
sheer
aversion
to
the
name
of
the
catholic
religion
where
this
is
seconded
by
a
sense
of
insults
a
little
too
offensive
when
the
fatigue
of
constant
has
almost
reached
the
point
of
exhaustion
and
when
under
these
circumstances
a
too
cruel
blow
one
of
those
mean
acts
which
a
man
never
lets
a
woman
know
of
unless
he
believes
himself
to
be
her
assured
master
puts
the
crowning
touch
to
her
revulsion
and
disenchantment
the
moment
has
come
for
the
intervention
of
the
friend
who
undertakes
the
cure
madame
piedefer
had
no
great
difficulty
now
in
removing
the
film
from
her
daughter
s
eyes
she
sent
for
monsieur
de
clagny
who
completed
the
work
by
assuring
madame
de
la
baudraye
that
if
she
would
give
up
etienne
her
husband
would
allow
her
to
keep
the
children
and
to
live
in
paris
and
would
restore
her
to
the
command
of
her
own
fortune
and
what
a
life
you
are
leading
said
he
with
care
and
judgment
and
the
support
of
some
pious
and
charitable
persons
you
may
have
a
salon
and
conquer
a
position
paris
is
not
dinah
left
it
to
monsieur
de
clagny
to
negotiate
a
reconciliation
with
the
old
man
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
had
sold
his
wine
well
he
had
sold
his
wool
he
had
felled
his
timber
and
without
telling
his
wife
he
had
come
to
paris
to
invest
two
hundred
thousand
francs
in
the
purchase
of
a
delightful
residence
in
the
rue
de
l
arcade
that
was
being
sold
in
liquidation
of
an
aristocratic
house
that
was
in
difficulties
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
council
for
the
department
since
and
now
paying
ten
thousand
francs
in
taxes
he
was
doubly
qualified
for
a
peerage
under
the
conditions
of
the
new
legislation
some
time
before
the
elections
of
he
had
put
himself
forward
as
candidate
unless
he
were
meanwhile
called
to
the
upper
house
as
peer
of
france
at
the
same
time
he
asked
for
the
title
of
count
and
for
promotion
to
the
higher
grade
of
the
legion
of
honor
in
the
matter
of
the
elections
the
dynastic
nominations
now
in
the
event
of
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
being
won
over
to
the
government
sancerre
would
be
more
than
ever
a
rotten
borough
of
royalism
monsieur
de
clagny
whose
talents
and
modesty
were
more
and
more
highly
appreciated
by
the
authorities
gave
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
his
support
he
pointed
out
that
by
raising
this
enterprising
agriculturist
to
the
peerage
a
guarantee
would
be
offered
to
such
important
undertakings
monsieur
de
la
baudraye
then
a
count
a
peer
of
france
and
commander
of
the
legion
of
honor
was
vain
enough
to
wish
to
cut
a
figure
with
a
wife
and
handsomely
appointed
he
wanted
to
enjoy
life
he
said
he
therefore
addressed
a
letter
to
his
wife
dictated
by
monsieur
de
clagny
begging
her
to
live
under
his
roof
and
to
furnish
the
house
giving
play
to
the
taste
of
which
the
evidences
he
said
had
charmed
him
at
the
chateau
d
anzy
the
newly
made
count
pointed
out
to
his
wife
that
while
the
interests
of
their
property
forbade
his
leaving
sancerre
the
education
of
their
boys
required
her
presence
in
paris
the
accommodating
husband
desired
monsieur
de
clagny
to
place
sixty
thousand
francs
at
the
disposal
of
madame
la
comtesse
for
the
interior
decoration
of
their
mansion
requesting
that
she
would
have
a
marble
tablet
inserted
over
the
gateway
with
the
inscription
de
la
he
then
accounted
to
his
wife
for
the
money
derived
from
the
estate
of
silas
piedefer
told
her
of
the
investment
at
four
and
a
half
per
cent
of
the
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
he
had
brought
from
new
york
and
allowed
her
that
income
for
her
expenses
including
the
education
of
the
children
as
he
would
be
compelled
to
stay
in
paris
during
some
part
of
the
session
of
the
house
of
peers
he
requested
his
wife
to
reserve
for
him
a
little
suite
of
rooms
in
an
over
the
kitchens
bless
me
why
he
is
growing
young
again
a
gentleman
a
magnifico
what
will
he
become
next
it
is
quite
alarming
said
madame
de
la
baudraye
he
now
fulfils
all
your
wishes
at
the
age
of
twenty
replied
the
lawyer
the
comparison
of
her
future
prospects
with
her
present
position
was
unendurable
to
dinah
only
the
day
before
anna
de
fontaine
had
turned
her
head
away
in
order
to
avoid
seeing
her
bosom
friend
at
the
chamarolles
school
i
am
a
countess
said
dinah
to
herself
i
shall
have
the
peer
s
blue
on
my
carriage
and
the
leaders
of
the
literary
world
in
my
and
i
will
look
at
her
and
it
was
this
little
triumph
that
told
with
all
its
weight
at
the
moment
of
her
rehabilitation
as
the
world
s
contempt
had
of
old
weighed
on
her
happiness
one
fine
day
in
may
madame
de
la
baudraye
paid
all
her
little
household
debts
and
left
a
thousand
crowns
on
top
of
the
packet
of
receipted
bills
after
sending
her
mother
and
the
children
away
to
the
hotel
de
la
baudraye
she
awaited
lousteau
dressed
ready
to
leave
the
house
when
the
deposed
king
of
her
heart
came
into
dinner
she
said
i
have
upset
the
pot
my
dear
madame
de
la
baudraye
requests
the
pleasure
of
your
company
at
the
de
she
carried
off
lousteau
quite
bewildered
by
the
light
and
easy
manners
assumed
by
the
woman
who
till
that
morning
has
been
the
slave
of
his
least
whim
for
she
too
had
been
acting
a
farce
for
two
months
past
madame
de
la
baudraye
is
figged
out
as
if
for
a
first
night
said
he
the
slang
abbreviation
for
a
first
performance
do
not
forget
the
respect
you
owe
to
madame
de
la
baudraye
said
dinah
gravely
i
do
not
mean
to
understand
such
a
word
as
didine
a
rebel
said
he
putting
his
arm
round
her
waist
there
is
no
such
person
as
didine
you
have
killed
her
my
dear
she
replied
releasing
herself
i
am
taking
you
to
the
first
performance
of
la
comtesse
de
la
it
is
true
then
that
our
insect
is
a
peer
of
france
the
nomination
is
to
be
gazetted
in
this
evening
s
as
i
am
told
by
monsieur
de
clagny
who
is
promoted
to
the
court
of
well
it
is
quite
right
said
the
journalist
the
entomology
of
society
ought
to
be
represented
in
the
upper
my
friend
we
are
parting
for
ever
said
madame
de
la
baudraye
trying
to
control
the
trembling
of
her
voice
i
have
dismissed
the
two
servants
when
you
go
in
you
will
find
the
house
in
order
and
no
debts
i
shall
always
feel
a
mother
s
affection
for
you
but
in
secret
let
us
part
calmly
without
a
fuss
like
decent
people
have
you
had
a
fault
to
find
with
my
conduct
during
the
past
six
years
none
but
that
you
have
spoiled
my
life
and
wrecked
my
prospects
said
he
in
a
hard
tone
you
have
read
benjamin
constant
s
book
very
diligently
you
have
even
studied
the
last
critique
on
it
but
you
have
read
with
a
woman
s
eyes
though
you
have
one
of
those
superior
intellects
which
would
make
a
fortune
of
a
poet
you
have
never
dared
to
take
the
man
s
point
of
view
that
book
my
dear
is
of
both
we
agreed
that
books
were
male
or
female
dark
or
fair
in
women
see
nothing
but
ellenore
young
men
see
only
adolphe
men
of
experience
see
ellenore
and
adolphe
political
men
see
the
whole
of
social
existence
you
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
read
the
soul
of
adolphe
any
more
than
your
critic
indeed
who
saw
only
ellenore
what
kills
that
poor
fellow
my
dear
is
that
he
has
sacrificed
his
future
for
a
woman
that
he
never
can
be
what
he
might
have
been
an
ambassador
a
minister
a
chamberlain
a
poet
and
rich
he
gives
up
six
years
of
his
energy
at
that
stage
of
his
life
when
a
man
is
ready
to
submit
to
the
hardships
of
any
apprenticeship
to
a
petticoat
which
he
outstrips
in
the
career
of
ingratitude
for
the
woman
who
has
thrown
over
her
first
lover
is
certain
sooner
or
later
to
desert
the
second
adolphe
is
in
fact
a
german
who
has
not
spirit
enough
to
be
false
to
ellenore
there
are
adolphes
who
spare
their
ellenores
all
ignominious
quarreling
and
reproaches
who
say
to
themselves
i
will
not
talk
of
what
i
have
sacrificed
i
will
not
for
ever
be
showing
the
stump
of
my
wrist
to
let
that
incarnate
selfishness
i
have
made
my
queen
as
ramorny
does
in
fair
maid
of
but
men
like
that
my
dear
get
cast
aside
adolphe
is
a
man
of
birth
an
aristocratic
nature
who
wants
to
get
back
into
the
highroad
to
honors
and
recover
his
social
birthright
his
blighted
you
at
this
moment
are
playing
both
parts
you
are
suffering
from
the
pangs
of
having
lost
your
position
and
think
yourself
justified
in
throwing
over
a
hapless
lover
whose
misfortune
it
has
been
that
he
fancied
you
so
far
superior
as
to
understand
that
though
a
man
s
heart
ought
to
be
true
his
sex
may
be
allowed
to
indulge
its
and
do
you
suppose
that
i
shall
not
make
it
my
business
to
restore
to
you
all
you
have
lost
by
me
be
quite
easy
said
madame
de
la
baudraye
astounded
by
this
attack
your
ellenore
is
not
dying
and
if
god
gives
her
life
if
you
amend
your
ways
if
you
give
up
courtesans
and
actresses
we
will
find
you
a
better
match
than
a
felicie
the
two
lovers
were
sullen
lousteau
affected
dejection
he
aimed
at
appearing
hard
and
cold
while
dinah
really
distressed
listened
to
the
reproaches
of
her
heart
why
said
lousteau
presently
why
not
end
as
we
ought
to
have
begun
hide
our
love
from
all
eyes
and
see
each
other
in
secret
never
cried
the
countess
with
an
icy
look
do
you
not
comprehend
that
we
are
after
all
but
finite
creatures
our
feelings
seem
infinite
by
reason
of
our
anticipation
of
heaven
but
here
on
earth
they
are
limited
by
the
strength
of
our
physical
being
there
are
some
feeble
mean
natures
which
may
receive
an
endless
number
of
wounds
and
live
on
but
there
are
some
more
souls
which
snap
at
last
under
repeated
blows
you
have
oh
enough
cried
he
no
more
copy
your
dissertation
is
unnecessary
since
you
can
justify
yourself
by
merely
saying
i
have
ceased
to
love
what
she
exclaimed
in
bewilderment
is
it
i
who
have
ceased
to
love
certainly
you
have
calculated
that
i
gave
you
more
trouble
more
vexation
than
pleasure
and
you
desert
your
partner
i
desert
cried
she
clasping
her
hands
have
not
you
yourself
just
said
never
well
then
yes
she
repeated
vehemently
this
final
spoken
in
the
fear
of
falling
once
more
under
lousteau
s
influence
was
interpreted
by
him
as
the
of
his
power
since
dinah
remained
insensible
to
his
sarcastic
scorn
the
journalist
could
not
suppress
a
tear
he
was
losing
a
sincere
and
unbounded
affection
he
had
found
in
dinah
the
gentlest
la
valliere
the
most
delightful
pompadour
that
any
egoist
short
of
a
king
could
hope
for
and
like
a
boy
who
has
discovered
that
by
dint
of
tormenting
a
cockchafer
he
has
killed
it
lousteau
shed
a
tear
madame
de
la
baudraye
rushed
out
of
the
private
room
where
they
had
been
dining
paid
the
bill
and
fled
home
to
the
rue
de
l
arcade
scolding
herself
and
thinking
herself
a
brute
dinah
who
had
made
her
house
a
model
of
comfort
now
metamorphosed
herself
this
double
metamorphosis
cost
thirty
thousand
francs
more
than
her
husband
had
anticipated
the
fatal
accident
which
in
deprived
the
house
of
orleans
of
the
having
necessitated
a
meeting
of
the
chambers
in
august
of
that
year
little
la
baudraye
came
to
present
his
titles
to
the
upper
house
sooner
than
he
had
expected
and
then
saw
what
his
wife
had
done
he
was
so
much
delighted
that
he
paid
the
thirty
thousand
francs
without
a
word
just
as
he
had
formerly
paid
eight
thousand
for
decorating
la
baudraye
on
his
return
from
the
luxembourg
where
he
had
been
presented
according
to
custom
by
two
of
his
peers
the
baron
de
nucingen
and
the
marquis
de
montriveau
the
new
count
met
the
old
duc
de
chaulieu
a
former
creditor
walking
along
umbrella
in
hand
while
he
himself
sat
perched
in
a
low
chaise
on
which
his
was
resplendent
with
the
motto
sic
patet
fides
et
this
contrast
filled
his
heart
with
a
large
draught
of
the
balm
on
which
the
middle
class
has
been
getting
drunk
ever
since
madame
de
la
baudraye
was
shocked
to
see
her
husband
improved
and
looking
better
than
on
the
day
of
his
marriage
the
little
dwarf
full
of
rapturous
delight
at
triumphed
in
the
life
which
had
so
long
been
denied
him
in
the
family
which
his
handsome
cousin
milaud
of
nevers
had
declared
he
would
never
have
and
in
his
wife
who
had
asked
monsieur
and
madame
de
clagny
to
dinner
to
meet
the
cure
of
the
parish
and
his
two
sponsors
to
the
chamber
of
peers
he
petted
the
children
with
fatuous
delight
the
handsome
display
on
the
table
met
with
his
approval
these
are
the
fleeces
of
the
berry
sheep
said
he
showing
monsieur
de
nucingen
the
surmounted
by
his
coronet
they
are
of
silver
you
see
though
consumed
by
melancholy
which
she
concealed
with
the
determination
of
a
really
superior
woman
dinah
was
charming
witty
and
above
all
young
again
in
her
court
mourning
you
might
declare
cried
la
baudraye
to
monsieur
de
nucingen
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
to
his
wife
that
the
countess
was
not
yet
ah
ha
matame
is
a
voman
of
dirty
replied
the
baron
who
was
prone
to
remarks
which
he
took
to
be
the
small
change
of
conversation
in
every
sense
of
the
words
replied
the
countess
i
am
in
fact
and
mean
to
set
up
a
little
passion
oh
yes
my
wife
ruins
me
in
curiosities
and
china
images
she
started
that
mania
at
an
early
age
said
the
marquis
de
montriveau
with
a
smile
yes
said
la
baudraye
with
a
cold
stare
at
the
marquis
whom
he
had
known
at
bourges
you
know
that
in
and
she
picked
a
million
francs
worth
of
treasures
anzy
is
a
perfect
what
a
cool
hand
thought
monsieur
de
clagny
as
he
saw
this
little
country
miser
quite
on
the
level
of
his
new
position
but
misers
have
savings
of
all
kinds
ready
for
use
on
the
day
after
the
vote
on
the
regency
had
passed
the
chambers
the
little
count
went
back
to
sancerre
for
the
vintage
and
resumed
his
old
habits
in
the
course
of
that
winter
the
comtesse
de
la
baudraye
with
the
support
of
the
to
the
court
of
appeals
tried
to
form
a
little
circle
of
course
she
had
an
at
home
day
she
made
a
selection
among
men
of
mark
receiving
none
but
those
of
serious
purpose
and
ripe
years
she
tried
to
amuse
herself
by
going
to
the
opera
french
and
italian
twice
a
week
she
appeared
there
with
her
mother
and
madame
de
clagny
who
was
made
by
her
husband
to
visit
dinah
still
in
spite
of
her
cleverness
her
charming
manners
her
fashionable
stylishness
she
was
never
really
happy
but
with
her
children
on
whom
she
lavished
all
her
disappointed
affection
worthy
monsieur
de
clagny
tried
to
recruit
women
for
the
countess
circle
and
he
succeeded
but
he
was
more
successful
among
the
advocates
of
piety
than
the
women
of
fashion
and
they
bore
her
said
he
to
himself
with
horror
as
he
saw
his
idol
matured
by
grief
pale
from
remorse
and
then
in
all
the
splendor
of
recovered
beauty
restored
by
a
life
of
luxury
and
care
for
her
boys
this
devoted
friend
encouraged
in
his
efforts
by
her
mother
and
by
the
cure
was
full
of
expedient
every
wednesday
he
introduced
some
celebrity
from
germany
england
italy
or
prussia
to
his
dear
countess
he
spoke
of
her
as
a
quite
exceptional
woman
to
people
to
whom
she
hardly
addressed
two
words
but
she
listened
to
them
with
such
deep
attention
that
they
went
away
fully
convinced
of
her
superiority
in
paris
dinah
conquered
by
silence
as
at
sancerre
she
had
conquered
by
loquacity
now
and
then
some
smart
saying
about
affairs
or
sarcasm
on
an
absurdity
betrayed
a
woman
accustomed
to
deal
with
ideas
the
woman
who
four
years
since
had
given
new
life
to
lousteau
s
articles
this
phase
was
to
the
poor
lawyer
s
hapless
passion
like
the
late
season
known
as
the
indian
summer
after
a
sunless
year
he
affected
to
be
older
than
he
was
to
have
the
right
to
befriend
dinah
without
doing
her
an
injury
and
kept
himself
at
a
distance
as
though
he
were
young
handsome
and
compromising
like
a
man
who
has
happiness
to
conceal
he
tried
to
keep
his
little
attentions
a
profound
secret
and
the
trifling
gifts
which
dinah
showed
to
every
one
he
endeavored
to
suggest
a
dangerous
meaning
for
his
little
services
he
plays
at
passion
said
the
countess
laughing
she
made
fun
of
monsieur
de
clagny
to
his
face
and
the
lawyer
said
she
notices
i
impress
that
poor
man
so
deeply
said
she
to
her
mother
laughing
that
if
i
would
say
yes
i
believe
he
would
say
one
evening
monsieur
de
clagny
and
his
wife
were
taking
his
dear
countess
home
from
the
theatre
and
she
was
deeply
pensive
they
had
been
to
the
first
performance
of
leon
gozlan
s
first
play
main
droite
et
la
main
the
right
hand
and
the
left
what
are
you
thinking
about
asked
the
lawyer
alarmed
at
his
idol
s
dejection
this
deep
and
persistent
melancholy
though
disguised
by
the
countess
was
a
perilous
malady
for
which
monsieur
de
clagny
knew
no
remedy
for
true
love
is
often
clumsy
especially
when
it
is
not
reciprocated
true
love
takes
its
expression
from
the
character
now
this
good
man
loved
after
the
fashion
of
alceste
when
madame
de
la
baudraye
wanted
to
be
loved
after
the
manner
of
philinte
the
meaner
side
of
love
can
never
get
on
with
the
misanthrope
s
loyalty
thus
dinah
had
taken
care
never
to
open
her
heart
to
this
man
how
could
she
confess
to
him
that
she
sometimes
regretted
the
slough
she
had
left
she
felt
a
void
in
this
fashionable
life
she
had
no
one
for
whom
to
dress
or
whom
to
tell
of
her
successes
and
triumphs
sometimes
the
memory
of
her
wretchedness
came
to
her
mingled
with
memories
of
consuming
joys
she
would
hate
lousteau
for
not
taking
any
pains
to
follow
her
she
would
have
liked
to
get
tender
or
furious
letters
from
him
dinah
made
no
reply
so
monsieur
de
clagny
repeated
the
question
taking
the
countess
hand
and
pressing
it
between
his
own
with
devout
respect
will
you
have
the
right
hand
or
the
left
said
she
smiling
the
left
said
he
for
i
suppose
you
mean
the
truth
or
a
well
then
i
saw
him
she
said
speaking
into
the
lawyer
s
ear
and
as
i
saw
him
looking
so
sad
so
out
of
heart
i
said
to
myself
has
he
a
cigar
has
he
any
money
if
you
wish
for
the
truth
i
can
tell
it
you
said
the
lawyer
he
is
living
as
a
husband
with
fanny
beaupre
you
have
forced
me
to
tell
you
this
secret
i
should
never
have
told
you
for
you
might
have
suspected
me
perhaps
of
an
ungenerous
madame
de
la
baudraye
grasped
his
hand
your
husband
said
she
to
her
chaperon
is
one
of
the
rarest
souls
ah
why
she
shrank
into
her
corner
looking
out
of
the
window
but
she
did
not
finish
her
sentence
of
which
the
lawyer
could
guess
the
end
why
had
not
lousteau
a
little
of
your
husband
s
generosity
of
heart
this
information
served
however
to
cure
dinah
of
her
melancholy
she
threw
herself
into
the
whirl
of
fashion
she
wished
for
success
and
she
achieved
it
still
she
did
not
make
much
way
with
women
and
found
it
difficult
to
get
introductions
in
the
month
of
march
madame
piedefer
s
friends
the
priests
and
monsieur
de
clagny
made
a
fine
stroke
by
getting
madame
de
la
baudraye
appointed
receiver
of
subscriptions
for
the
great
charitable
work
founded
by
madame
de
carcado
then
she
was
commissioned
to
collect
from
the
royal
family
their
donations
for
the
benefit
of
the
sufferers
from
the
earthquake
at
guadeloupe
the
marquise
d
espard
to
whom
monsieur
de
canalis
read
the
list
of
ladies
thus
appointed
one
evening
at
the
opera
said
on
hearing
that
of
the
countess
i
have
lived
a
long
time
in
the
world
and
i
can
remember
nothing
finer
than
the
manoeuvres
undertaken
for
the
rehabilitation
of
madame
de
la
in
the
early
spring
which
by
some
whim
of
our
planets
smiled
on
paris
in
the
first
week
of
march
in
making
the
green
and
leafy
before
longchamp
fanny
beaupre
s
attache
had
seen
madame
de
la
baudraye
several
times
without
being
seen
by
her
more
than
once
he
was
stung
to
the
heart
by
one
of
those
promptings
of
jealousy
and
envy
familiar
to
those
who
are
born
and
bred
provincials
when
he
beheld
his
former
mistress
comfortably
ensconced
in
a
handsome
carriage
well
dressed
with
dreamy
eyes
and
his
two
little
boys
one
at
each
window
he
accused
himself
with
all
the
more
virulence
because
he
was
waging
war
with
the
sharpest
poverty
of
all
poverty
unconfessed
like
all
essentially
light
and
frivolous
natures
he
cherished
the
singular
point
of
honor
which
consists
in
never
derogating
in
the
eyes
of
one
s
own
little
public
which
makes
men
on
the
bourse
commit
crimes
to
escape
expulsion
from
the
temple
of
the
goddess
and
has
given
some
criminals
courage
enough
to
perform
acts
of
virtue
lousteau
dined
and
breakfasted
and
smoked
as
if
he
were
a
rich
man
not
for
an
inheritance
would
he
have
bought
any
but
the
dearest
cigars
for
himself
as
well
as
for
the
playwright
or
author
with
whom
he
went
into
the
shop
the
journalist
took
his
walks
abroad
in
patent
leather
boots
but
he
was
constantly
afraid
of
an
execution
on
goods
which
to
use
the
bailiff
s
slang
had
already
received
the
last
sacrament
fanny
beaupre
had
nothing
left
to
pawn
and
her
salary
was
pledged
to
pay
her
debts
after
exhausting
every
possible
advance
of
pay
from
newspapers
magazines
and
publishers
etienne
knew
not
of
what
ink
he
could
churn
gold
so
ruthlessly
suppressed
could
no
longer
as
of
old
cash
i
o
u
s
drawn
over
the
green
table
by
beggary
in
despair
in
short
the
journalist
was
reduced
to
such
extremity
that
he
had
just
borrowed
a
hundred
francs
of
the
poorest
of
his
friends
bixiou
from
whom
he
had
never
yet
asked
for
a
franc
what
distressed
lousteau
was
not
the
fact
of
owing
five
thousand
francs
but
seeing
himself
bereft
of
his
elegance
and
of
the
furniture
purchased
at
the
cost
of
so
many
privations
and
added
to
by
madame
de
la
baudraye
on
april
the
a
yellow
poster
torn
down
by
the
porter
after
being
displayed
on
the
wall
announced
the
sale
of
a
handsome
suite
of
furniture
on
the
following
saturday
the
day
fixed
for
sales
under
legal
authority
lousteau
was
taking
a
walk
smoking
cigars
and
seeking
ideas
for
in
paris
ideas
are
in
the
air
they
smile
on
you
from
a
street
corner
they
splash
up
with
a
spurt
of
mud
from
under
the
wheels
of
a
cab
thus
loafing
he
had
been
seeking
ideas
for
articles
and
subjects
for
novels
for
a
month
past
and
had
found
nothing
but
friends
who
carried
him
off
to
dinner
or
to
the
play
and
who
intoxicated
his
woes
telling
him
that
champagne
would
inspire
him
beware
said
the
virulent
bixiou
one
night
the
man
who
would
at
the
same
moment
give
a
comrade
a
hundred
francs
and
stab
him
to
the
heart
with
a
sarcasm
if
you
go
to
sleep
drunk
every
night
one
day
you
will
wake
up
on
the
day
before
the
friday
the
unhappy
wretch
although
he
was
accustomed
to
poverty
felt
like
a
man
condemned
to
death
of
old
he
would
have
said
well
the
furniture
is
very
old
i
will
buy
but
he
was
incapable
now
of
literary
legerdemain
publishers
undermined
by
piracy
paid
badly
the
newspapers
made
close
bargains
with
writers
as
the
opera
managers
did
with
tenors
that
sang
flat
he
walked
on
his
eye
on
the
crowd
though
seeing
nothing
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
every
feature
of
his
face
twitching
and
an
affected
smile
on
his
lips
then
he
saw
madame
de
la
baudraye
go
by
in
a
carriage
she
was
going
to
the
boulevard
by
the
rue
de
la
chaussee
d
antin
to
drive
in
the
bois
there
is
nothing
else
left
said
he
to
himself
and
he
went
home
to
smarten
himself
up
that
evening
at
seven
he
arrived
in
a
hackney
cab
at
madame
de
la
baudraye
s
door
and
begged
the
porter
to
send
a
note
up
to
the
countess
a
few
lines
as
follows
would
madame
la
comtesse
do
monsieur
lousteau
the
favor
of
receiving
him
for
a
moment
and
at
once
this
note
was
sealed
with
a
seal
which
as
lovers
they
had
both
used
madame
de
la
baudraye
had
had
the
word
engraved
on
a
genuine
oriental
carnelian
a
potent
word
a
woman
s
word
the
word
that
accounts
for
everything
even
for
the
creation
the
countess
had
just
finished
dressing
to
go
to
the
opera
friday
was
her
night
in
turn
for
her
box
at
the
sight
of
this
seal
she
turned
pale
i
will
come
she
said
tucking
the
note
into
her
dress
she
was
firm
enough
to
conceal
her
agitation
and
begged
her
mother
to
see
the
children
put
to
bed
she
then
sent
for
lousteau
and
received
him
in
a
boudoir
next
to
the
great
with
open
doors
she
was
going
to
a
ball
after
the
opera
and
was
wearing
a
beautiful
dress
of
brocade
in
stripes
alternately
plain
and
flowered
with
pale
blue
her
gloves
trimmed
with
tassels
showed
off
her
beautiful
white
arms
she
was
shimmering
with
lace
and
all
the
dainty
trifles
required
by
fashion
her
hair
dressed
la
gave
her
a
look
of
elegance
a
necklace
of
pearls
lay
on
her
bosom
like
bubbles
on
snow
what
is
the
matter
monsieur
said
the
countess
putting
out
her
foot
from
below
her
skirt
to
rest
it
on
a
velvet
cushion
i
thought
i
hoped
i
was
quite
if
i
should
reply
you
would
refuse
to
believe
me
said
lousteau
who
remained
standing
or
walked
about
the
room
chewing
the
flowers
he
plucked
from
the
full
of
plants
that
scented
the
room
for
a
moment
silence
reigned
madame
de
la
baudraye
studying
lousteau
saw
that
he
was
dressed
as
the
most
fastidious
dandy
might
have
been
you
are
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
can
help
me
or
hold
out
a
plank
to
me
for
i
am
drowning
and
have
already
swallowed
more
than
one
mouthful
said
he
standing
still
in
front
of
dinah
and
seeming
to
yield
to
an
overpowering
impulse
since
you
see
me
here
it
is
because
my
affairs
are
going
to
the
that
is
enough
said
she
i
there
was
another
pause
during
which
lousteau
turned
away
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
seemed
to
wipe
away
a
tear
how
much
do
you
want
etienne
she
went
on
in
motherly
tones
we
are
at
this
moment
old
comrades
speak
to
me
as
you
would
to
to
to
save
my
furniture
from
vanishing
into
thin
air
morning
at
the
auction
mart
eighteen
hundred
francs
to
repay
my
friends
as
much
again
three
quarters
rent
to
the
landlord
whom
you
my
uncle
wants
five
hundred
francs
and
you
to
live
on
oh
i
have
my
pen
it
is
heavier
to
lift
than
any
one
could
believe
who
reads
your
articles
said
she
with
a
subtle
i
have
not
such
a
sum
as
you
need
but
come
at
eight
the
bailiff
will
surely
wait
till
nine
especially
if
you
bring
him
away
to
pay
she
must
she
felt
dismiss
lousteau
who
affected
to
be
unable
to
look
at
her
she
herself
felt
such
pity
as
might
cut
every
social
gordian
knot
thank
you
she
added
rising
and
offering
her
hand
to
lousteau
your
confidence
has
done
me
good
it
is
long
indeed
since
my
heart
has
known
such
joy
lousteau
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
tenderly
to
his
heart
a
drop
of
water
in
the
desert
and
sent
by
the
hand
of
an
angel
god
always
does
things
handsomely
he
spoke
half
in
jest
and
half
pathetically
but
believe
me
as
a
piece
of
acting
it
was
as
fine
as
talma
s
in
his
famous
part
of
which
was
played
throughout
with
touches
of
this
kind
dinah
felt
his
heart
beating
through
his
coat
it
was
throbbing
with
satisfaction
for
the
journalist
had
had
a
narrow
escape
from
the
hulks
of
justice
but
it
also
beat
with
a
very
natural
fire
at
seeing
dinah
rejuvenescent
and
restored
by
wealth
madame
de
la
baudraye
stealing
an
examining
glance
at
etienne
saw
that
his
expression
was
in
harmony
with
the
flowers
of
love
which
as
she
thought
had
blossomed
again
in
that
throbbing
heart
she
tried
to
look
once
into
the
eyes
of
the
man
she
had
loved
so
well
but
the
seething
blood
rushed
through
her
veins
and
mounted
to
her
brain
their
eyes
met
with
the
same
fiery
glow
as
had
encouraged
lousteau
on
the
quay
by
the
loire
to
crumple
dinah
s
muslin
gown
the
bohemian
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
she
yielded
and
their
cheeks
were
touching
here
comes
my
mother
hide
cried
dinah
in
alarm
and
she
hurried
forward
to
intercept
madame
piedefer
mamma
said
she
this
word
was
to
the
stern
old
lady
a
coaxing
expression
which
never
failed
of
its
effect
will
you
do
me
a
great
favor
take
the
carriage
and
go
yourself
to
my
banker
monsieur
mongenod
with
a
note
i
will
give
you
and
bring
back
six
thousand
francs
come
come
it
is
an
act
of
charity
come
into
my
and
she
dragged
away
her
mother
who
seemed
very
anxious
to
see
who
it
was
that
her
daughter
had
been
talking
with
in
the
boudoir
two
days
afterwards
madame
piedefer
held
a
conference
with
the
cure
of
the
parish
after
listening
to
the
lamentations
of
the
old
mother
who
was
in
despair
the
priest
said
very
gravely
any
moral
regeneration
which
is
not
based
on
a
strong
religious
sentiment
and
carried
out
in
the
bosom
of
the
church
is
built
on
the
many
means
of
grace
enjoined
by
the
catholic
religion
small
as
they
are
and
not
understood
are
so
many
dams
necessary
to
restrain
the
violence
of
evil
promptings
persuade
your
daughter
to
perform
all
her
religious
duties
and
we
shall
save
her
within
ten
days
of
this
meeting
the
hotel
de
la
baudraye
was
shut
up
the
countess
the
children
and
her
mother
in
short
the
whole
household
including
a
tutor
had
gone
away
to
sancerre
where
dinah
intended
to
spend
the
summer
she
was
everything
that
was
nice
to
the
count
people
said
and
so
the
muse
of
sancerre
had
simply
come
back
to
family
and
married
life
but
certain
evil
tongues
declared
that
she
had
been
compelled
to
come
back
for
that
the
little
peer
s
wishes
would
no
doubt
be
fulfilled
he
hoped
for
a
little
girl
gatien
and
monsieur
gravier
lavished
every
care
every
servile
attention
on
the
handsome
countess
gatien
who
during
madame
de
la
baudraye
s
long
absence
had
been
to
paris
to
learn
the
art
of
or
dandyism
was
supposed
to
have
a
good
chance
of
finding
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
disenchanted
superior
