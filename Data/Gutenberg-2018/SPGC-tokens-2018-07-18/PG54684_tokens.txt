introduction
one
who
loves
simplicity
or
respects
sincerity
any
one
who
feels
the
tie
binding
us
all
together
in
the
helplessness
of
our
common
human
life
and
running
from
the
lowliest
as
well
as
the
highest
to
the
mystery
immeasurably
above
the
whole
earth
must
find
a
rare
and
tender
pleasure
in
this
simple
story
of
an
italian
fishing
village
i
can
not
promise
that
it
will
interest
any
other
sort
of
readers
but
i
do
not
believe
that
any
other
sort
are
worth
interesting
and
so
i
can
praise
signor
verga
s
book
without
reserve
as
one
of
the
most
perfect
pieces
of
literature
that
i
know
when
we
talk
of
the
great
modern
movement
towards
reality
we
speak
without
the
documents
if
we
leave
this
book
out
of
the
count
for
i
can
think
of
no
other
novel
in
which
the
facts
have
been
more
faithfully
reproduced
or
with
a
profounder
regard
for
the
poetry
that
resides
in
facts
and
resides
nowhere
else
signor
verdi
began
long
ago
in
his
dei
life
of
the
fields
to
give
proof
of
his
fitness
to
live
in
our
time
and
after
some
excursions
in
the
region
of
french
naturalism
he
here
returns
to
the
original
sources
of
his
inspiration
and
offers
us
a
masterpiece
of
the
finest
realism
he
is
i
believe
a
sicilian
of
that
meridional
race
among
whom
the
italian
language
first
took
form
and
who
in
these
latest
days
have
done
some
of
the
best
things
in
italian
literature
it
is
of
the
far
south
that
he
writes
and
of
people
whose
passions
are
elemental
and
whose
natures
are
simple
the
characters
therefore
are
types
of
good
and
of
evil
of
good
and
of
generosity
of
truth
and
of
falsehood
they
are
not
the
less
personal
for
this
reason
and
the
life
which
they
embody
is
none
the
less
veritable
it
will
be
well
for
the
reader
who
comes
to
this
book
with
the
usual
prejudices
against
the
southern
italians
to
know
that
such
souls
as
padron
ntoni
and
maruzza
la
longa
with
their
impassioned
conceptions
of
honor
and
duty
exist
among
them
and
that
such
love
idyls
as
that
of
mena
and
alfio
so
sweet
so
pure
and
the
happier
but
not
less
charming
romance
of
alessio
and
nunziata
are
passages
of
a
life
supposed
wholly
benighted
and
degraded
this
poet
as
i
must
call
the
author
does
again
the
highest
office
of
poetry
in
making
us
intimate
with
the
hearts
of
men
of
another
faith
race
and
condition
and
teaching
us
how
like
ourselves
they
are
in
all
that
is
truest
in
them
padron
ntoni
and
la
longa
luca
mena
alfio
nunziata
alessio
if
harshlier
named
might
pass
for
new
england
types
which
we
boast
the
product
of
puritanism
but
which
are
really
the
product
of
conscience
and
order
the
children
of
disorder
who
move
through
the
story
the
selfish
the
vicious
the
greedy
like
don
sylvestro
and
la
vespa
and
goosefoot
and
or
the
merely
weak
like
poor
ntoni
malavoglia
are
not
so
different
from
our
own
images
either
when
seen
in
this
clear
glass
which
falsifies
and
distorts
nothing
few
tales
i
think
are
more
moving
more
full
of
heartbreak
than
this
for
few
are
so
honest
by
this
i
mean
that
the
effect
in
it
is
precisely
that
which
the
author
aimed
at
he
meant
to
let
us
see
just
what
manner
of
men
and
women
went
to
make
up
the
life
of
a
little
italian
town
of
the
present
day
and
he
meant
to
let
the
people
show
themselves
with
the
least
possible
explanation
or
comment
from
him
the
transaction
of
the
story
is
in
the
highest
degree
dramatic
but
events
follow
one
another
with
the
even
sequence
of
hours
on
the
clock
you
are
not
prepared
to
value
them
beforehand
they
are
not
advertised
to
tempt
your
curiosity
like
feats
promised
at
the
circus
in
the
fashion
of
the
feebler
novels
often
it
is
in
the
retrospect
that
you
recognize
their
importance
and
perceive
their
full
significance
in
this
most
subtly
artistic
management
of
his
material
the
author
is
most
a
master
and
almost
more
than
any
other
he
has
the
rare
gift
of
trusting
the
intelligence
of
his
reader
he
seems
to
have
no
more
sense
of
authority
or
supremacy
concerning
the
personages
than
any
one
of
them
would
have
in
telling
the
story
and
he
has
as
completely
freed
himself
from
literosity
as
the
most
unlettered
among
them
under
his
faithful
touch
life
seems
mainly
sad
in
trezza
because
life
is
mainly
sad
everywhere
and
because
men
there
have
not
yet
adjusted
themselves
to
the
only
terms
which
can
render
life
tolerable
anywhere
they
are
still
rivals
traitors
enemies
and
have
not
learned
that
in
the
vast
orphanage
of
nature
they
have
no
resource
but
love
and
union
among
themselves
and
submission
to
the
unfathomable
wisdom
which
was
before
they
were
yet
seen
aright
this
picture
of
a
little
bit
of
the
world
very
common
and
low
down
and
far
off
has
a
consolation
which
no
one
need
miss
there
as
in
every
part
of
the
world
and
in
the
whole
world
goodness
brings
not
pleasure
not
happiness
but
it
brings
peace
and
rest
to
the
soul
and
lightens
all
burdens
the
trial
and
the
sorrow
go
on
for
good
and
evil
alike
only
those
who
choose
the
evil
have
no
peace
howells
the
house
by
the
i
the
malavoglia
were
as
numerous
as
the
stones
on
the
old
road
to
trezza
there
were
some
even
at
ognino
and
at
aci
castello
and
good
and
brave
seafaring
folk
quite
the
opposite
of
what
they
might
appear
to
be
from
their
nickname
of
the
as
is
but
right
in
fact
in
the
parish
books
they
were
called
toscani
but
that
meant
nothing
because
since
the
world
was
a
world
at
ognino
at
trezza
and
at
aci
castello
they
had
been
known
as
malavoglia
from
father
to
son
who
had
always
had
boats
on
the
water
and
tiles
in
the
sun
now
at
trezza
there
remained
only
padron
ntoni
and
his
family
who
owned
the
which
was
anchored
in
the
sand
below
the
by
the
side
of
uncle
cola
s
and
padron
fortunato
cipolla
s
bark
the
tempests
which
had
scattered
all
the
other
malavoglia
to
the
four
winds
had
passed
over
the
house
by
the
and
the
boat
anchored
under
the
tank
without
doing
any
great
damage
and
padron
ntoni
to
explain
the
miracle
used
to
say
showing
his
closed
fist
a
fist
which
looked
as
if
it
were
made
of
walnut
wood
to
pull
a
good
oar
the
five
fingers
must
help
one
he
also
said
men
are
like
the
fingers
of
the
hand
the
thumb
must
be
the
thumb
and
the
little
finger
the
little
and
padron
ntoni
s
little
family
was
really
disposed
like
the
fingers
of
a
hand
first
he
came
the
thumb
who
ordered
the
fasts
and
the
feasts
in
the
house
then
bastian
his
son
called
bastianazzo
because
he
was
as
big
and
as
grand
as
the
saint
christopher
which
was
painted
over
the
arch
of
the
in
town
and
big
and
grand
as
he
was
he
went
right
about
at
the
word
of
command
and
wouldn
t
have
blown
his
nose
unless
his
father
had
told
him
to
do
it
so
he
took
to
wife
la
longa
when
his
father
said
to
him
take
her
then
came
la
longa
a
little
woman
who
attended
to
her
weaving
her
salting
of
anchovies
and
her
babies
as
a
good
should
do
last
the
grandchildren
in
the
order
of
their
age
ntoni
the
eldest
a
big
fellow
of
twenty
who
was
always
getting
cuffs
from
his
grandfather
and
then
kicks
a
little
farther
down
if
the
cuffs
had
been
heavy
enough
to
disturb
his
equilibrium
luca
who
had
more
sense
than
the
big
one
the
grandfather
said
mena
filomena
surnamed
sant
agata
because
she
was
always
at
the
loom
and
the
proverb
goes
woman
at
the
loom
hen
in
the
coop
and
mullet
in
january
alessio
our
urchin
that
was
his
grandfather
all
over
and
lia
rosalia
as
yet
neither
fish
nor
flesh
on
sunday
when
they
went
into
church
one
after
another
they
looked
like
a
procession
padron
ntoni
was
in
the
habit
of
using
certain
proverbs
and
sayings
of
old
times
for
said
he
the
sayings
of
the
ancients
never
lie
without
a
pilot
the
boat
won
t
go
to
be
pope
one
must
begin
by
being
sacristan
or
stick
to
the
trade
you
know
somehow
you
ll
manage
to
go
be
content
to
be
what
your
father
was
then
you
ll
be
neither
a
knave
nor
an
ass
and
other
wise
saws
therefore
the
house
by
the
medlar
was
prosperous
and
padron
ntoni
passed
for
one
of
the
weighty
men
of
the
village
to
that
extent
that
they
would
have
made
him
a
communal
councillor
only
don
silvestro
the
who
was
very
knowing
insisted
that
he
was
a
rotten
a
reactionary
who
went
in
for
the
bourbons
and
conspired
for
the
return
of
franceschello
that
he
might
tyrannize
over
the
village
as
he
tyrannized
over
his
own
house
padron
ntoni
instead
did
not
even
know
franceschello
by
sight
and
used
to
say
he
who
has
the
management
of
a
house
can
not
sleep
when
he
likes
for
he
who
commands
must
give
in
december
ntoni
the
eldest
grandson
was
called
up
for
the
naval
conscription
padron
ntoni
had
recourse
to
the
of
the
village
who
are
those
who
can
help
us
if
they
like
but
don
giammaria
the
vicar
replied
that
he
deserved
it
and
that
it
was
the
fruit
of
that
satanic
revolution
which
they
had
made
hanging
that
tricolored
handkerchief
to
the
campanile
don
franco
the
druggist
on
the
other
hand
laughed
under
his
beard
and
said
it
was
quite
time
there
should
be
a
revolution
and
that
then
they
would
send
all
those
fellows
of
the
draft
and
the
taxes
flying
and
there
would
be
no
more
soldiers
but
everybody
would
go
out
and
fight
for
their
country
if
there
was
need
of
it
then
padron
ntoni
begged
and
prayed
him
for
the
love
of
god
to
make
the
revolution
quickly
before
his
grandson
ntoni
went
for
a
soldier
as
if
don
franco
had
it
in
his
pocket
so
that
at
last
the
druggist
flew
into
a
rage
then
don
silvestro
the
dislocated
his
jaws
with
laughter
at
the
talk
and
finally
he
said
that
by
means
of
certain
little
packets
slipped
into
certain
pockets
that
he
knew
of
they
might
manage
to
get
his
nephew
found
defective
in
some
way
and
sent
back
for
a
year
unfortunately
the
doctor
when
he
saw
the
tall
youth
told
him
that
his
only
defect
was
to
be
planted
like
a
column
on
those
big
ugly
feet
that
looked
like
the
leaves
of
a
but
such
feet
as
that
would
be
of
more
use
on
the
deck
of
ah
in
certain
rough
times
that
were
coming
than
pretty
small
ones
in
tight
boots
and
so
he
took
ntoni
without
saying
by
your
la
longa
when
the
conscripts
went
up
to
their
quarters
trotted
breathless
by
the
side
of
her
son
reminding
him
that
he
must
always
remember
to
keep
round
his
neck
the
piece
of
the
madonna
s
dress
that
she
had
given
him
and
to
send
home
news
whenever
any
one
came
that
way
that
he
knew
and
she
would
give
him
money
to
buy
paper
the
grandfather
being
a
man
said
nothing
but
felt
a
lump
in
his
throat
too
and
would
not
look
his
in
the
face
so
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
angry
with
her
so
they
returned
to
aci
trezza
silent
with
bowed
heads
bastianazzo
who
had
unloaded
the
in
a
great
hurry
went
to
meet
them
at
the
top
of
the
street
and
when
he
saw
them
coming
sadly
with
their
shoes
in
their
hands
had
no
heart
to
speak
but
turned
round
and
went
back
with
them
to
the
house
la
longa
rushed
away
to
the
kitchen
longing
to
find
herself
alone
with
the
familiar
saucepans
and
padron
ntoni
said
to
his
son
go
and
say
something
to
that
poor
child
she
can
bear
it
no
the
day
after
they
all
went
back
to
the
station
of
aci
castello
to
see
the
train
pass
with
the
conscripts
who
were
going
to
messina
and
waited
behind
the
bars
hustled
by
the
crowd
for
more
than
an
hour
finally
the
train
arrived
and
they
saw
their
boys
all
swarming
with
their
heads
out
of
the
little
windows
like
oxen
going
to
a
fair
the
singing
the
laughter
and
the
noise
made
it
seem
like
the
festa
of
trecastagni
and
in
the
flurry
and
the
fuss
they
forgot
their
aching
hearts
for
a
while
adieu
ntoni
adieu
mamma
addio
remember
remember
near
by
on
the
margin
of
the
ditch
pretending
to
be
cutting
grass
for
the
calf
was
cousin
tudda
s
sara
but
cousin
venera
the
zuppidda
hobbler
went
on
whispering
that
she
had
come
there
to
see
padron
ntoni
s
ntoni
with
whom
she
used
to
talk
over
the
wall
of
the
garden
she
had
seen
them
herself
with
those
very
eyes
which
the
worms
would
one
day
devour
certain
it
is
that
ntoni
waved
his
hand
to
sara
and
that
she
stood
still
with
the
sickle
in
her
hand
gazing
at
the
train
as
long
as
it
was
there
to
la
longa
it
seemed
that
that
wave
of
the
hand
had
been
stolen
from
her
and
when
she
met
cousin
tudda
s
sara
on
the
piazza
public
square
or
at
the
tank
where
they
washed
she
turned
her
back
on
her
for
a
long
time
after
then
the
train
moved
off
hissing
and
screaming
so
as
to
drown
the
adieus
and
the
songs
and
then
the
curious
crowd
dispersed
leaving
only
a
few
poor
women
and
some
poor
devils
that
still
stood
clinging
to
the
bars
without
knowing
why
then
one
by
one
they
also
moved
away
and
padron
ntoni
guessing
that
his
must
have
a
bitter
taste
in
her
mouth
spent
two
centimes
for
a
glass
of
water
with
in
it
for
her
cousin
venera
the
zuppidda
to
comfort
her
gossip
la
longa
said
to
her
now
you
may
set
your
heart
at
rest
for
for
five
years
you
may
look
upon
your
son
as
dead
and
think
no
more
about
but
they
did
think
of
him
all
the
time
at
the
house
by
the
medlar
now
it
would
be
a
plate
too
many
which
la
longa
found
in
her
hand
when
she
was
getting
supper
ready
now
some
knot
or
other
that
nobody
could
tie
like
ntoni
in
the
rigging
and
when
some
rope
had
to
be
pulled
taut
or
turn
some
screw
the
grandfather
groaning
ejaculated
here
we
want
ntoni
or
do
you
think
i
have
a
wrist
like
that
boy
s
the
mother
passing
the
shuttle
through
the
loom
that
went
one
two
three
thought
of
the
boum
boum
of
the
engine
that
had
dragged
away
her
son
which
had
sounded
ever
since
in
her
heart
one
two
three
the
grandpapa
too
had
certain
singular
methods
of
consolation
what
will
you
have
a
little
soldiering
will
do
that
boy
good
he
always
liked
better
to
carry
his
two
arms
out
of
a
sunday
than
to
work
with
them
for
his
or
when
he
has
learned
how
salt
the
bread
is
that
one
eats
elsewhere
he
won
t
growl
any
longer
about
the
minestra
at
macaroni
of
inferior
quality
finally
there
arrived
the
first
letter
from
ntoni
which
convulsed
the
village
he
said
that
the
women
oft
there
swept
the
streets
with
their
silk
petticoats
and
that
on
the
mole
there
was
punch
s
theatre
and
that
they
sold
those
little
round
cheeses
that
rich
people
eat
for
two
centimes
and
that
one
could
not
get
along
without
soldi
that
did
well
enough
at
trezza
where
unless
one
went
to
santuzza
s
at
the
tavern
one
didn
t
know
how
to
spend
one
s
money
set
him
up
with
his
cheeses
the
glutton
said
his
grandfather
he
can
t
help
it
though
he
always
was
like
that
if
i
hadn
t
held
him
at
the
font
in
these
arms
i
should
have
said
don
giammaria
had
put
sugar
in
his
mouth
instead
of
the
mangiacarubbe
when
she
was
at
the
tank
and
cousin
tudda
s
sara
was
by
went
on
saying
certainly
those
ladies
with
the
silk
dresses
waited
on
purpose
for
padron
ntoni
s
ntoni
to
steal
him
away
they
haven
t
got
any
down
there
the
others
held
their
sides
with
laughing
and
henceforth
the
envious
girls
called
ntoni
ntoni
had
sent
his
portrait
too
all
the
girls
at
the
tank
had
seen
it
as
sara
showed
it
to
one
after
another
passing
it
under
her
apron
and
the
mangiacarubbe
shivered
with
jealousy
he
looked
like
saint
michael
the
archangel
with
those
feet
planted
on
a
fine
carpet
and
a
curtain
behind
his
head
like
that
of
the
madonna
at
ognino
and
he
was
so
handsome
so
clean
and
smooth
and
neat
that
the
mother
that
bore
him
wouldn
t
have
known
him
and
poor
la
longa
was
never
tired
of
gazing
at
the
curtain
and
the
carpet
and
that
pillar
against
which
her
son
stood
up
stiff
as
a
post
scratching
with
his
hand
the
back
of
a
beautiful
and
she
thanked
god
and
the
saints
who
had
placed
her
boy
in
the
midst
of
such
splendors
she
kept
the
portrait
on
the
bureau
under
the
glass
globe
which
covered
the
figure
of
the
good
shepherd
so
that
she
said
her
prayers
to
it
the
zuppidda
said
and
thought
she
had
a
great
treasure
on
the
bureau
and
after
all
sister
mariangela
the
santuzza
had
just
such
another
anybody
that
cared
to
might
see
it
that
cousin
mariano
cinghialenta
had
given
her
and
she
kept
it
nailed
upon
the
tavern
counter
among
the
bottles
but
after
a
while
ntoni
got
hold
of
a
comrade
who
could
write
and
then
he
let
himself
go
in
abuse
of
the
hard
life
on
board
ship
the
discipline
the
superiors
the
thin
rice
soup
and
the
tight
shoes
a
letter
that
wasn
t
worth
the
twenty
centimes
for
the
postage
said
padron
ntoni
la
longa
scolded
about
the
writing
that
looked
like
a
lot
of
fishhooks
and
said
nothing
worth
hearing
bastianazzo
shook
his
head
saying
no
it
wasn
t
good
at
all
and
that
if
it
had
been
he
he
would
have
always
put
nice
things
to
please
people
down
there
on
the
paper
pointing
at
it
with
a
finger
as
big
as
the
pin
of
a
rowlock
if
it
were
only
out
of
compassion
for
la
longa
who
since
her
boy
was
gone
went
about
like
a
cat
that
had
lost
her
kitten
padron
ntoni
went
in
secret
first
to
don
giammaria
and
then
to
don
franco
the
druggist
and
got
the
letter
read
to
him
by
both
of
them
and
as
they
were
of
opposite
ways
of
thinking
he
was
persuaded
that
it
was
really
written
there
as
they
said
and
then
he
went
on
saying
to
bastianazzo
and
to
his
wife
didn
t
i
tell
you
that
boy
ought
to
have
been
born
rich
like
padron
cipolla
s
son
that
he
might
have
nothing
to
do
but
lie
in
the
sun
and
scratch
himself
meanwhile
the
year
was
a
bad
one
and
the
fish
had
to
be
given
for
the
souls
of
the
dead
now
that
christians
had
taken
to
eating
meat
on
friday
like
so
many
turks
besides
the
men
who
remained
at
home
were
not
enough
to
manage
the
boat
and
sometimes
they
had
to
take
la
locca
s
menico
by
the
day
to
help
the
king
did
this
way
you
see
he
took
the
boys
just
as
they
got
big
enough
to
earn
their
living
while
they
were
little
and
had
to
be
fed
he
left
them
at
home
and
there
was
mena
too
the
girl
was
seventeen
and
the
youths
began
to
stop
and
stare
at
her
as
she
went
into
church
so
it
was
necessary
to
work
with
hands
and
feet
too
to
drive
that
boat
at
the
house
by
the
padron
ntoni
therefore
to
drive
the
bark
had
arranged
with
uncle
crucifix
an
affair
concerning
certain
lupins
to
be
bought
on
credit
and
sold
again
at
riposto
where
cousin
cinghialenta
the
carrier
said
there
was
a
boat
loading
for
trieste
in
fact
the
lupins
were
beginning
to
rot
but
they
were
all
that
were
to
be
had
at
trezza
and
that
old
rascal
knew
that
the
was
eating
her
head
off
and
doing
nothing
so
he
pretended
to
be
very
stupid
indeed
eh
too
much
is
it
let
it
alone
then
but
i
can
t
take
a
centime
less
i
can
t
on
my
conscience
i
must
answer
for
my
soul
to
god
i
can
t
and
shook
his
head
till
it
looked
in
real
earnest
like
a
bell
without
a
clapper
this
conversation
took
place
at
the
door
of
the
church
at
ognino
on
the
first
sunday
in
september
which
was
the
feast
of
our
lady
there
was
a
great
concourse
of
people
from
all
the
neighborhood
and
there
was
present
also
cousin
agostino
goosefoot
who
by
talking
and
joking
managed
to
get
them
to
agree
upon
two
scudi
and
ten
the
bag
to
be
paid
by
the
month
it
was
always
so
with
uncle
crucifix
he
said
because
he
had
that
cursed
weakness
of
not
being
able
to
say
no
as
if
you
couldn
t
say
no
when
you
like
sneered
goosefoot
you
re
like
the
and
he
told
him
what
he
was
like
coarse
flat
beans
when
la
longa
heard
of
the
business
of
the
lupins
she
opened
her
eyes
very
wide
indeed
as
they
sat
with
their
elbows
on
the
after
supper
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
felt
the
weight
of
that
sum
of
forty
scudi
on
her
stomach
but
she
said
nothing
because
women
have
nothing
to
do
with
such
things
and
padron
ntoni
explained
to
her
how
if
the
affair
was
successful
there
would
be
bread
for
the
winter
and
for
mena
and
bastiano
could
go
and
come
in
a
week
from
riposto
with
la
locca
s
menico
bastiano
meantime
snuffed
the
candle
and
said
nothing
so
the
affair
of
the
lupins
was
arranged
and
the
voyage
of
the
which
was
the
oldest
boat
in
the
village
but
was
supposed
to
be
very
lucky
maruzza
had
a
heavy
heart
but
did
not
speak
he
went
about
indefatigably
preparing
everything
putting
the
boat
in
order
and
filling
the
cupboard
with
provisions
for
the
journey
fresh
bread
the
jar
with
oil
the
onions
and
putting
the
coat
under
the
deck
the
men
had
been
very
busy
all
day
with
that
usurer
uncle
crucifix
who
had
sold
a
pig
in
a
poke
and
the
lupins
were
spoiling
swore
that
he
knew
nothing
about
it
in
god
s
truth
bargaining
is
no
cheating
was
he
likely
to
throw
his
soul
to
the
pigs
and
goosefoot
scolded
and
blasphemed
like
one
possessed
to
bring
them
to
agreement
swearing
that
such
a
thing
had
never
happened
to
him
before
and
he
thrust
his
hands
among
the
lupins
and
held
them
up
before
god
and
the
madonna
calling
them
to
witness
at
last
red
panting
desperate
he
made
a
wild
proposition
and
flung
it
in
the
face
of
uncle
crucifix
who
pretended
to
be
quite
stupefied
and
of
the
malavoglia
with
the
sacks
in
their
hands
there
pay
it
at
christmas
instead
of
paying
so
much
a
month
and
you
will
gain
two
soldi
the
sack
now
make
an
end
of
it
holy
devil
and
he
began
to
measure
them
in
god
s
name
one
the
went
off
on
saturday
towards
evening
when
the
ave
maria
should
have
been
ringing
only
the
bell
was
silent
because
master
cirino
the
sacristan
had
gone
to
carry
a
pair
of
new
boots
to
don
silvestro
the
at
that
hour
the
girls
crowded
like
a
flight
of
sparrows
about
the
fountain
and
the
was
shining
brightly
already
just
over
the
mast
of
the
like
a
lamp
maruzza
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
stood
on
the
shore
without
speaking
while
her
husband
loosed
the
sail
and
the
danced
on
the
broken
waves
by
the
fariglione
like
a
duck
clear
south
wind
and
dark
north
go
fearlessly
forth
said
padron
ntoni
from
the
landing
looking
towards
the
mountains
dark
with
clouds
la
locca
s
menico
who
was
in
the
with
bastianazzo
called
out
something
which
was
lost
in
the
sound
of
the
sea
he
said
you
may
give
the
money
to
his
mother
for
his
brother
is
out
of
work
called
bastianazzo
and
that
was
the
last
word
that
was
heard
rocks
rising
straight
out
of
the
sea
separate
from
the
shore
ii
the
whole
place
nothing
was
talked
of
but
the
affair
of
the
lupins
and
as
la
longa
returned
with
lia
from
the
beach
the
gossips
came
to
their
doors
to
see
her
pass
oh
a
regular
golden
business
shouted
as
he
hitched
along
with
his
crooked
leg
behind
padron
ntoni
who
went
and
sat
down
on
the
with
padron
fortunato
cipolla
and
locca
menico
s
brother
who
were
taking
the
air
there
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
uncle
crucifix
screamed
as
if
you
had
been
pulling
out
his
but
you
needn
t
mind
that
he
has
plenty
of
quills
the
old
boy
oh
we
had
a
time
of
it
you
can
say
as
much
for
your
part
too
can
t
you
padron
ntoni
but
for
padron
ntoni
you
know
i
d
throw
myself
off
the
cliffs
any
day
so
i
would
before
god
and
uncle
crucifix
listens
to
me
because
he
knows
what
a
big
ladle
means
a
big
ladle
you
know
that
stirs
a
big
pot
where
there
s
more
than
two
hundred
scudi
a
year
why
old
wouldn
t
know
how
to
blow
his
nose
if
i
wasn
t
by
to
show
him
la
locca
s
son
hearing
them
talk
of
uncle
crucifix
who
was
really
his
uncle
because
he
was
la
locca
s
brother
felt
his
heart
swelling
with
family
affection
we
are
relations
he
repeated
when
i
go
there
to
work
by
the
day
he
gives
me
only
halfwages
and
no
wine
because
we
are
old
goosefoot
sneered
he
does
it
for
your
good
so
that
you
shouldn
t
take
to
drinking
and
that
he
may
have
more
money
to
leave
you
when
he
then
old
goosefoot
went
on
amusing
himself
by
speaking
ill
now
of
one
now
of
another
as
it
happened
but
so
without
malice
that
no
one
could
catch
him
in
anything
actionable
he
said
to
la
locca
s
son
your
uncle
wants
to
nobble
your
cousin
vespa
wasp
out
of
her
garden
trying
to
get
her
to
let
him
have
it
for
half
what
it
s
worth
making
her
believe
he
ll
marry
her
but
if
la
vespa
succeeds
in
drawing
him
on
you
may
go
whistle
for
your
inheritance
and
you
ll
lose
the
wages
he
hasn
t
given
you
and
the
wine
you
didn
t
then
they
began
to
dispute
for
padron
ntoni
insisted
upon
it
that
after
all
uncle
was
a
christian
and
hadn
t
quite
thrown
his
brains
into
the
gutter
to
go
and
marry
his
brother
s
what
has
christian
to
do
with
it
or
turk
either
growled
goosefoot
he
s
mad
you
mean
he
s
as
rich
as
a
pig
what
does
he
want
of
that
little
garden
of
vespa
s
as
big
as
a
and
she
has
nothing
but
i
ought
to
know
how
big
it
is
it
lies
along
my
vineyard
said
padron
cipolla
puffing
himself
like
a
turkey
you
call
that
a
vineyard
four
sneered
goosefoot
between
the
the
vines
grow
and
if
saint
francis
will
send
us
a
good
shower
of
rain
you
ll
see
if
i
don
t
have
some
good
wine
the
sun
went
to
bed
loaded
with
rain
or
with
when
the
sun
goes
to
bed
heavy
one
must
look
for
a
west
wind
said
padron
ntoni
goosefoot
couldn
t
bear
cipolla
s
sententious
way
of
talking
thinking
because
he
was
rich
he
must
know
everything
and
could
make
the
poor
people
swallow
whatever
nonsense
he
chose
to
talk
one
wants
rain
and
one
wants
wind
he
wound
up
padron
cipolla
wants
rain
for
his
vines
and
padron
ntoni
wants
a
wind
to
push
the
poop
of
the
you
know
the
proverb
curly
is
the
sea
a
fresh
wind
there
ll
be
the
stars
are
shining
at
midnight
the
wind
will
change
don
t
you
hear
the
on
the
road
there
was
heard
the
sound
of
heavy
carts
slowly
passing
night
or
day
somebody
s
always
going
about
the
world
said
cipolla
a
little
later
on
now
that
they
could
no
longer
see
the
sea
or
the
fields
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
only
trezza
in
the
world
and
everybody
wondered
where
the
carts
could
be
going
at
that
hour
before
midnight
the
will
have
rounded
the
cape
of
the
mills
and
the
wind
won
t
trouble
her
any
padron
ntoni
thought
of
nothing
but
the
and
when
they
were
not
talking
of
her
he
said
nothing
and
sat
like
a
post
among
the
talkers
you
ought
to
go
across
the
street
to
the
druggist
s
where
they
are
talking
politics
you
d
make
a
fine
figure
among
them
listen
how
they
shout
that
s
don
giammaria
said
la
locca
s
son
disputing
with
don
the
druggist
was
holding
a
conversation
at
the
door
of
his
shop
with
the
vicar
and
two
or
three
others
as
he
was
a
cultured
person
he
got
the
newspaper
and
read
it
too
and
let
others
read
it
and
he
had
the
of
the
french
which
he
kept
under
the
glass
mortar
because
he
quarrelled
about
it
every
day
with
don
giammaria
the
vicar
to
pass
the
time
and
they
got
positively
bilious
over
it
but
they
couldn
t
have
lived
a
day
without
seeing
each
other
on
saturdays
when
the
paper
came
don
franco
went
so
far
as
to
burn
a
candle
for
half
an
hour
or
even
for
a
whole
hour
at
the
risk
of
a
scolding
from
his
wife
so
as
to
explain
his
ideas
properly
and
not
go
to
bed
like
a
brute
as
uncle
cipolla
and
old
malavoglia
did
in
the
summer
besides
there
was
no
need
of
a
candle
for
they
could
stand
under
the
lamp
at
the
door
when
mastro
cirino
lighted
it
and
sometimes
don
michele
the
brigadier
of
the
customs
guard
joined
them
and
don
silvestro
the
too
coming
back
from
his
vineyard
stopped
for
a
moment
then
don
franco
would
say
rubbing
his
hands
that
they
were
quite
a
parliament
and
go
off
behind
his
counter
passing
his
fingers
through
his
long
beard
like
a
comb
with
a
shrewd
little
grin
as
if
he
were
going
to
eat
somebody
for
his
breakfast
and
would
let
slip
broken
phrases
under
his
breath
full
of
hidden
meaning
so
that
it
was
plain
enough
that
he
knew
more
than
all
the
world
put
together
and
don
giammaria
couldn
t
bear
the
sight
of
him
and
grew
yellow
with
fury
and
spit
latin
at
him
don
silvestro
for
his
part
was
greatly
amused
to
see
how
he
poisoned
his
blood
trying
to
straighten
out
a
dog
s
legs
he
said
without
a
chance
of
making
a
centime
by
it
he
at
least
didn
t
lose
his
temper
as
they
and
for
that
reason
they
said
in
the
place
that
he
had
the
best
farms
in
trezza
that
he
had
come
to
a
barefooted
ragamuffin
added
old
goosefoot
he
would
set
the
disputants
at
each
other
as
if
they
had
been
dogs
and
laughed
fit
to
split
his
sides
with
shrill
cries
of
ah
ah
ah
like
a
cackling
hen
goosefoot
went
off
again
with
the
old
story
that
if
don
silvestro
had
been
willing
to
stay
where
he
belonged
it
would
be
a
spade
he
d
be
wielding
now
and
not
a
pen
would
you
give
him
your
granddaughter
mena
said
cipolla
at
last
turning
to
padron
ntoni
each
to
his
own
business
leave
the
wolf
to
look
after
the
padron
cipolla
kept
on
nodding
his
head
all
the
more
that
there
had
been
some
talk
between
him
and
padron
ntoni
of
marrying
mena
to
his
son
brasi
if
the
lupin
business
went
on
well
the
dowry
would
be
paid
down
in
cash
and
the
affair
settled
immediately
the
girl
as
she
has
been
trained
and
the
tow
as
it
has
been
spun
said
padron
malavoglia
at
last
and
padron
cipolla
agreed
that
everybody
in
the
place
knew
that
la
longa
had
brought
up
her
girl
beautifully
that
anybody
who
passed
through
the
alley
behind
the
house
by
the
medlar
at
the
hour
at
which
they
were
talking
could
hear
the
sound
of
sant
agata
s
loom
cousin
maruzza
didn
t
waste
her
oil
after
dark
that
she
didn
t
he
said
la
longa
just
as
she
came
back
from
the
beach
sat
down
at
the
window
to
prepare
the
thread
for
the
loom
cousin
mena
is
not
seen
but
heard
and
she
stays
at
the
loom
day
and
night
like
sant
agata
said
the
neighbors
that
s
the
way
to
bring
up
girls
replied
maruzza
instead
of
letting
them
stay
gaping
out
the
window
don
t
go
after
the
girl
at
the
window
says
the
some
of
them
though
staring
out
of
window
manage
to
catch
the
foolish
fish
that
pass
said
her
cousin
anna
from
the
opposite
door
cousin
anna
really
her
cousin
this
time
not
only
called
so
by
way
of
had
reason
and
to
spare
for
this
speech
for
that
great
hulking
fellow
her
son
rocco
had
tacked
himself
on
to
the
mangiacarubbe
s
and
she
was
always
leaning
out
of
the
window
toasting
her
face
in
the
sun
gossip
grazia
goosefoot
hearing
that
there
was
a
conversation
going
on
came
to
her
door
with
her
apron
full
of
the
beans
she
was
shelling
and
railed
about
the
mice
who
had
made
her
sack
like
a
sieve
eating
holes
all
over
it
as
if
they
had
had
wits
like
christians
so
the
talk
became
general
because
those
accursed
little
brutes
had
done
maruzza
all
sorts
of
harm
too
cousin
anna
had
her
house
full
of
them
too
since
she
had
lost
her
cat
a
beast
worth
its
weight
in
gold
who
had
died
of
a
kick
from
uncle
tino
the
gray
cats
are
the
best
to
catch
mice
they
d
go
after
them
into
a
needle
s
one
shouldn
t
open
the
door
to
the
cat
by
night
for
an
old
woman
at
aci
sant
antonio
got
killed
that
way
by
thieves
who
stole
her
cat
three
days
before
and
then
brought
her
back
half
starved
to
mew
at
the
door
and
the
poor
woman
couldn
t
bear
to
hear
the
creature
out
in
the
street
at
that
hour
and
opened
the
door
and
so
the
wretches
got
in
nowadays
the
rascals
invent
all
sorts
of
tricks
to
gain
their
ends
and
at
trezza
one
saw
faces
now
that
nobody
had
ever
seen
on
the
coast
coming
pretending
to
be
fishing
and
catching
up
the
clothes
that
were
out
to
dry
if
they
could
manage
it
they
had
stolen
a
new
sheet
from
poor
nunziata
that
way
poor
girl
robbing
her
who
worked
so
hard
to
feed
those
little
brothers
that
her
father
left
on
her
hands
when
he
went
off
seeking
his
fortune
in
alexandria
in
egypt
nunziata
was
like
what
cousin
anna
herself
had
been
when
her
husband
died
and
left
her
with
that
houseful
of
little
children
and
rocco
the
biggest
of
them
no
higher
than
her
knee
then
after
all
the
trouble
of
rearing
him
great
lazy
fellow
she
must
stand
by
and
see
the
mangiacarubbe
carry
him
into
the
midst
of
this
gossiping
came
venera
la
zuppidda
wife
to
bastiano
the
calker
she
lived
at
the
foot
of
the
lane
and
always
appeared
unexpectedly
like
the
devil
at
the
litany
who
came
from
nobody
knew
where
to
say
his
say
like
the
rest
for
that
matter
she
muttered
your
son
rocco
never
helped
you
a
bit
if
he
got
hold
of
a
soldo
he
spent
it
at
the
la
zuppidda
knew
everything
that
went
on
in
the
place
and
for
this
reason
they
said
she
went
about
all
day
barefoot
with
that
distaff
that
she
was
always
holding
over
her
head
to
keep
the
thread
off
the
gravel
playing
the
spy
she
was
the
spinning
was
only
a
pretext
she
always
told
gospel
truth
that
was
a
habit
of
hers
and
people
who
didn
t
like
to
have
the
truth
told
about
them
accused
her
of
being
a
wicked
slanderer
one
of
those
whose
tongues
dropped
gall
bitter
mouth
spits
gall
says
the
proverb
and
a
bitter
mouth
she
had
for
that
barbara
of
hers
that
she
had
never
been
able
to
marry
so
naughty
and
rude
she
was
and
with
all
that
she
would
like
to
give
her
victor
emmanuel
s
son
for
a
husband
a
nice
one
she
is
the
mangiacarubbe
she
went
on
a
hussy
that
has
called
the
whole
village
one
after
another
under
her
window
choose
no
woman
at
the
window
says
the
proverb
and
vanni
pizzuti
gave
her
the
figs
he
stole
from
mastro
philip
the
ortolano
and
they
ate
them
together
in
the
vineyard
under
the
i
saw
them
myself
and
peppi
joe
naso
the
butcher
after
he
began
to
be
jealous
of
mariano
cinghialenta
the
carter
used
to
throw
all
the
horns
of
the
beasts
he
killed
behind
her
door
so
that
they
said
he
combed
his
head
under
the
mangiacarubbe
s
that
cousin
anna
instead
took
it
easily
don
t
you
know
don
giammaria
says
it
is
a
mortal
sin
to
speak
evil
of
one
s
neighbors
don
giammaria
had
better
preach
to
his
own
sister
donna
rosolina
replied
la
zuppidda
and
not
let
her
go
playing
off
the
airs
of
a
young
girl
at
don
silvestro
when
he
goes
past
the
house
and
with
don
michele
the
brigadier
she
s
dying
to
get
married
with
all
that
fat
too
and
at
her
age
she
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
the
lord
s
will
be
done
said
cousin
anna
in
conclusion
when
my
husband
died
rocco
wasn
t
taller
than
this
spindle
and
his
sisters
were
all
younger
than
he
perhaps
i
ve
lost
my
soul
for
them
grief
hardens
the
heart
they
say
and
hard
work
the
hands
but
the
harder
they
are
the
better
one
can
work
with
them
my
daughters
will
do
as
i
have
done
and
while
there
are
stones
in
the
we
shall
have
enough
to
live
on
look
at
nunziata
she
s
as
wise
as
an
old
and
she
works
for
those
babies
as
if
she
had
borne
them
and
where
is
nunziata
that
she
doesn
t
come
back
asked
la
longa
of
a
group
of
ragged
little
fellows
who
sat
whining
on
the
steps
of
the
tumbledown
little
house
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
when
they
heard
their
sister
s
name
they
began
to
howl
in
chorus
i
saw
her
go
down
to
the
beach
after
broom
to
burn
said
cousin
anna
and
your
son
alessio
was
with
her
the
children
stopped
howling
to
listen
then
began
to
cry
again
all
at
once
and
the
biggest
one
perched
like
a
little
chicken
on
the
top
step
said
gravely
after
a
while
i
don
t
know
where
she
the
neighbors
all
came
out
like
snails
in
a
shower
and
all
along
the
little
street
was
heard
a
perpetual
chatter
from
one
door
to
another
even
alfio
mosca
who
had
the
had
opened
his
window
and
a
great
smell
of
came
out
of
it
mena
had
left
the
loom
and
come
out
on
the
oh
sant
agata
they
all
cried
and
made
a
great
fuss
over
her
aren
t
you
thinking
of
marrying
your
mena
asked
la
zuppidda
in
a
low
tone
of
maruzza
she
s
already
eighteen
come
i
know
her
age
she
was
born
in
the
year
of
the
earthquake
like
my
barbara
whoever
wants
my
barbara
must
first
please
at
this
moment
was
heard
a
sound
of
boughs
scraping
on
the
road
and
up
came
luca
and
who
couldn
t
be
seen
under
the
big
bundle
of
they
were
so
little
oh
nunziata
called
out
the
neighbors
were
not
you
afraid
at
this
hour
so
far
from
home
i
was
with
them
said
alessio
i
was
late
washing
with
cousin
anna
and
then
i
had
nothing
to
light
the
fire
the
little
girl
lighted
the
lamp
and
began
to
get
ready
for
supper
the
children
trotting
up
and
down
the
little
kitchen
after
her
so
that
she
looked
like
a
hen
with
her
chickens
alessio
had
thrown
down
his
fagot
and
stood
gazing
out
of
the
door
gravely
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
oh
nunziata
called
out
mena
from
the
doorstep
when
you
ve
lighted
the
fire
come
over
here
for
a
nunziata
left
alessio
to
look
after
her
fire
and
ran
across
to
perch
herself
on
the
landing
beside
sant
agata
to
enjoy
a
little
rest
hand
in
hand
with
her
friend
friend
alfio
mosca
is
cooking
his
broad
beans
now
observed
nunziata
after
a
little
he
is
like
you
poor
fellow
you
have
neither
of
you
any
one
to
get
the
minestra
ready
by
the
time
you
come
home
tired
in
the
yes
it
is
true
that
and
he
knows
how
to
sew
and
to
wash
and
mend
his
nunziata
knew
everything
that
alfio
did
and
knew
every
inch
of
her
neighbor
s
house
as
if
it
had
been
the
palm
of
her
hand
now
she
said
he
has
gone
to
get
wood
now
he
is
cleaning
his
donkey
and
she
watched
his
light
as
it
moved
about
the
house
sant
agata
laughed
and
nunziata
said
that
to
be
precisely
like
a
woman
alfio
only
wanted
a
petticoat
so
concluded
mena
when
he
marries
his
wife
will
go
round
with
the
and
he
ll
stay
at
home
and
look
after
the
the
mothers
grouped
about
the
street
talked
about
alfio
mosca
too
and
how
la
vespa
swore
that
she
wouldn
t
have
him
for
a
husband
so
said
la
zuppidda
because
the
wasp
had
her
own
nice
little
property
and
wanted
to
marry
somebody
who
owned
something
better
than
a
she
has
been
casting
sheep
s
eyes
at
her
uncle
the
little
rogue
the
girls
for
their
parts
defended
alfio
against
that
ugly
wasp
and
nunziata
felt
her
heart
swell
with
contempt
at
the
way
they
scorned
alfio
only
because
he
was
poor
and
alone
in
the
world
and
all
of
a
sudden
she
said
to
mena
if
i
was
grown
up
i
d
marry
him
so
i
would
if
they
d
let
mena
was
going
to
say
something
herself
but
she
changed
the
subject
suddenly
are
you
going
to
town
for
the
all
souls
festa
no
i
can
t
leave
the
house
all
we
are
to
go
if
the
business
of
the
lupins
goes
well
grandpapa
says
then
she
thought
a
minute
and
added
cousin
alfio
he
s
going
too
to
sell
his
nuts
at
the
and
the
girls
sat
silent
thinking
of
the
feast
of
all
souls
and
how
alfio
was
going
there
to
sell
his
nuts
old
uncle
crucifix
how
quietly
he
puts
vespa
in
his
pocket
began
cousin
anna
all
over
again
that
s
what
she
wants
cried
la
zuppidda
in
her
abrupt
way
to
be
pocketed
la
vespa
wants
just
that
and
nothing
else
she
s
always
in
his
house
on
one
pretext
or
another
slipping
in
like
a
cat
with
something
good
for
him
to
eat
or
drink
and
the
old
man
never
refuses
what
costs
him
nothing
she
fattens
him
up
like
a
pig
for
christmas
i
tell
you
she
asks
nothing
better
than
to
get
into
his
every
one
had
something
to
say
about
uncle
crucifix
who
was
always
whining
when
instead
he
had
money
by
the
shovelful
for
la
zuppidda
one
day
when
the
old
man
was
ill
had
seen
a
chest
under
his
bed
as
big
as
that
la
longa
felt
the
weight
of
the
forty
scudi
of
debt
for
the
lupins
and
changed
the
subject
because
one
hears
also
in
the
dark
and
they
could
hear
the
voice
of
uncle
crucifix
talking
with
don
giammaria
who
was
crossing
the
piazza
close
by
while
la
zuppidda
broke
off
her
abuse
of
him
to
wish
him
don
silvestro
laughed
his
hen
s
cackle
and
this
fashion
of
laughing
enraged
the
apothecary
who
had
never
had
any
patience
for
that
matter
he
left
that
to
such
asses
as
wouldn
t
get
up
another
revolution
no
you
never
had
any
shouted
don
giammaria
to
him
you
have
no
place
to
put
and
don
franco
who
was
a
little
man
went
into
a
fury
and
called
ugly
names
after
the
priest
which
could
be
heard
all
across
the
piazza
in
the
dark
old
hard
as
a
stone
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
took
care
to
repeat
that
all
that
was
nothing
to
him
he
attended
to
his
own
as
if
the
affairs
of
the
company
of
the
happy
death
were
not
your
affairs
said
don
giammaria
and
nobody
paying
a
soldo
any
more
when
it
is
a
question
of
putting
their
hands
in
their
pockets
these
people
are
a
lot
of
protestants
worse
than
that
heathen
apothecary
and
let
the
box
of
the
confraternity
become
a
nest
for
mice
it
was
positively
beastly
don
franco
from
his
shop
sneered
at
them
all
at
the
top
of
his
voice
trying
to
imitate
don
silvestro
s
cackling
laugh
which
was
enough
to
madden
anybody
but
everybody
knew
that
the
druggist
was
a
freemason
and
don
giammaria
called
out
to
him
from
the
piazza
you
d
find
the
money
fast
enough
if
it
was
for
schools
or
for
illuminations
the
apothecary
didn
t
answer
for
his
wife
just
then
appeared
at
the
window
and
uncle
crucifix
when
he
was
far
enough
off
not
to
be
heard
by
don
silvestro
the
clerk
who
gobbled
up
the
salary
for
the
master
of
the
elementary
school
it
is
nothing
to
me
he
repeated
but
in
my
time
there
weren
t
so
many
lamps
nor
so
many
schools
and
we
were
a
deal
better
you
never
were
at
school
and
you
can
manage
your
affairs
well
and
i
know
my
catechism
too
said
uncle
crucifix
not
to
be
behindhand
in
politeness
in
the
heat
of
dispute
don
giammaria
lost
the
pavement
which
he
could
cross
with
his
eyes
shut
and
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
his
neck
and
of
letting
slip
god
forgive
us
a
very
naughty
word
at
least
if
they
d
light
their
lamps
in
these
days
one
must
look
after
one
s
steps
concluded
uncle
crucifix
don
giammaria
pulled
him
by
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
to
tell
him
about
this
one
and
that
one
in
the
middle
of
the
piazza
in
the
dark
of
the
lamplighter
who
stole
the
oil
and
don
silvestro
who
winked
at
it
and
of
the
sindic
giufà
who
let
himself
be
led
by
the
nose
nodded
his
head
in
assent
mechanically
though
they
couldn
t
see
each
other
and
don
giammaria
as
he
passed
the

in
review
said
this
one
is
a
thief
that

is
a
rascal
the
other
is
a
jacobin
so
you

goosefoot
there
talking
with

malavoglia
and
padron
cipolla
another
heretic
that
one
a
demagogue
he
is
with
that
crooked
leg
of
his
and
when
he
went
limping
across
the
piazza
he
moved
out
of
his
way
and
watched
him
distrustfully
trying
to
find
out
what
he
was
after
hitching
about
that
way
he
has
the
cloven
foot
like
the
devil
he
muttered
uncle
crucifix
shrugged
his
shoulders
again
and
repeated
that
he
was
an
honest
man
that
he
didn
t
mix
himself
up
with
padron
cipolla
was
another
old
fool
a
regular
balloon
that
fellow
to
let
himself
be
blindfolded
by
old
goosefoot
and
padron
ntoni
too
he
ll
get
a
fall
before

one
may
expect
anything
in
these
honest
men

to
their
own
business
repeated
uncle

instead
uncle

sitting
up
like

president
on

church
steps
went
on
uttering
wise
sentences

the

listening
with
his
mouth
open
scratching
his
head
bravo
he
said
that
way
they
wouldn
t
find
any
fish
at
messina
nor

and
instead
they
came
from

by
the

at
a
for

the
best

growled

knocking
at
the
door
of
his
house
all
a
lot
of
thieves
he
went
on
muttering
with
the
knocker
in
his
hand
following
with
suspicious
eye
the
form
of
the
brigadier
who
disappeared
in
the
darkness
towards
the
tavern
and
wondering
what
he
was
doing
at
the
tavern
protecting
honest
men
s
goods
all
the
same
daddy
tino
knew
why
don
michele
went
in
the
direction
of
the
tavern
to
protect
the
interests
of
honest
people
for
he
had
spent
whole
nights
watching
for
him
behind
the
big
elm
to
find
out
and
he
used
to
say
he
goes
to
talk
on
the
sly
with
uncle
santoro
santuzza
s
father
those
fellows
that
the
king
feeds
must
all
be
spies
and
know
all
about
everybody
s
business
in
trezza
and
everywhere
else
and
old
uncle
santoro
blind
as
he
is
blinking
like
a
bat
in
the
sunshine
at
the
tavern
door
knows
everything
that
goes
on
in
the
place
and
could
call
us
by
name
one
after
another
only
by
the
maruzza
hearing
the
bell
strike
went
into
the
house
quickly
to
spread
the
cloth
on
the
table
the
gossips
little
by
little
had
disappeared
and
as
the
village
went
to
sleep
the
sea
became
audible
once
more
at
the
foot
of
the
little
street
and
every
now
and
then
it
gave
a
great
sigh
like
a
sleepless
man
turning
on
his
bed
only
down
by
the
tavern
where
the
red
light
shone
the
noise
continued
and
rocco

in

twinkled
faster
than

out
over

out
obliquely
like
saint
andrew
the
sea
moved
at
the
foot
of
the
street
softly
softly
and
at
long
intervals
was
heard
the
rumbling
of
some
cart
passing
in
the
dark
grinding
on
the
stones
and
going
out
into
the
wide
world
so
wide
so
wide
that
if
one
could
walk
forever
one
couldn
t
get
to
the
end
of
it
and
there
were
people
going
up
and
down
in
this
wide
world
that
knew
nothing
of

of

out
once

twice
on
the
landing
before
closing

looking
at
the

twinkled
more
than
they
need
have
done
and
then
muttered

song
under

red
light
at
the
tavern

iii
midnight
the
wind
began
to
howl
as
if
all
the
cats
in
the
place
had
been
on
the
roof
and
to
shake
the
shutters
the
sea
roared
round
the

as
if
all
the
bulls
of
the
fair
of

had
been
there
and
the
day
opened
as
black
as
the
soul
of

an
ugly
september
sunday
dawned
a
sunday
in
false

which
lets
loose
a
tempest
on

between

from

were
all
drawn
up
on

well
fastened
to
the
great

under

the

amused
themselves
by
hissing
and
howling
whenever
there
passed
by
some
lonely
sail
far
out
at
sea
tossed
amid
mist
and
foam
dancing
up
and
down
as
if
chased
by
the
devil
the
women
instead
made
the
sign
of

as
if
they
could

with
their

were
on

silent
as

but
she
could
not
stand
still
a

and
went
up
and
down
and
in
and
out
without
stopping
like
a
hen
that
is
going
to
lay
an
egg
the
men
were
at
the
tavern
or
in
pizzuti

shop
or
under
the
butcher

shed
watching
the
rain
sniffing
the

with

up
on

looking
out
for

shrugging
his

then
when

is
stolen

shut

of

with
a
very
big

in

have
touched

on
chill
and
sad
now
and
then
there
came
a
blast
of
north
wind
bringing
a
shower
of
fine
cold
rain
it
was
one
of
those
evenings
when
if
the
bark
lies
high
and
safe
with
her
belly
in
the
sand
one
enjoys
watching
the
simmering
pot
with
the
baby
between
one

knees
and
listening
to
the
housewife
trotting
to
and
fro
behind
one

preferred
going
to
the

to
enjoy
the
sunday
which
seemed
likely
to
last
over

as
well
and
the

shone
in

until

sitting
out
there

cliffs
to
watch
the
sea
which
from
that
point
could
be
seen
quite
well
and
hearing
the
moaning
waves
she
felt
faint
and
sick
but
said
nothing
the
little
girl
cried
and
these
poor
things
forgotten
up
there
on
the
rocks
seemed
like
souls
in
purgatory
the
little
one
s
cries
made
the
mother
quite
sick
it
seemed
like
an
evil
omen
she
couldn
t
think
what
to
do
to
keep
the
child
quiet
and
she
sang
to
her
song
after
song
with
a
trembling
voice
loaded
with
the
men
on
their
way
back
from
the
tavern
with
pot
of
oil
or
flask
of
wine
stopped
to
exchange
a
few
words
with
la
longa
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
some
of
bastianazzo
s
special
friends
cipolla
for
example
or
mangiacarubbe
walking
out
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
giving
a
look
out
to
see
in
what
sort
of
a
temper
the
old
growler
was
going
to
sleep
in
went
up
to
cousin
maruzza
asking
about
her
husband
and
staying
a
few
minutes
to
keep
her
company
pipe
in
mouth
or
talking
softly
among
themselves
the
poor
little
woman
frightened
by
these
unusual
attentions
looked
at
them
with
sad
scared
eyes
and
held
her
baby
tight
in
her
arms
as
if
they
had
tried
to
steal
it
from
her
at
last
the
hardest
or
the
most
compassionate
of
them
took
her
by
the
arm
and
led
her
home
she
let
herself
be
led
only
saying
over
and
over
again
o
blessed
virgin
o
blessed
virgin
mary
the
children
clung
to
her
skirts
as
if
they
had
been
afraid
somebody
was
going
to
steal
something
from
them
too
when
they
passed
before
the
tavern
all
the
customers
stopped
talking
and
came
to
the
door
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
gazing
at
her
as
if
she
were
already
a
curiosity
mumbled
old
santoro
under
his
breath
that
poor
bastianazzo
always
gave
me
something
when
his
father
let
him
have
a
soldo
to
spend
for
the
poor
little
thing
who
did
not
even
know
she
was
a
widow
went
on
crying
o
blessed
virgin
o
blessed
virgin
o
virgin
mary
before
the
steps
of
her
house
the
neighbors
were
waiting
for
her
talking
among
themselves
in
a
low
voice
when
they
saw
her
coming
mammy
and
her
cousin
anna
came
towards
her
silently
with
folded
hands
then
she
wound
her
hands
wildly
in
her
hair
and
with
a
distracted
screech
rushed
to
hide
herself
in
the
house
what
a
misfortune
they
said
among
themselves
in
the
street
and
the
boat
was
loaded
forty
scudi
worth
of
lupins
iv
worst
part
of
it
was
that
the
lupins
had
been
bought
on
credit
and
uncle
crucifix
was
not
content
with
fair
words
and
rotten
he
was
called
because
he
was
deaf
on
one
side
and
turned
that
side
when
people
wanted
to
pay
him
with
talk
saying
the
payment
can
be
he
lived
by
lending
to
his
friends
having
no
other
trade
and
for
this
reason
he
stood
about
all
day
in
the
piazza
or
with
his
back
to
the
wall
of
the
church
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
that
ragged
old
jacket
that
nobody
would
have
given
him
a
soldo
for
but
he
had
as
much
money
as
you
wanted
and
if
any
one
wanted
ten
francs
he
was
ready
to
lend
them
right
off
on
pledge
of
course
he
who
lends
money
without
security
loses
his
friends
his
goods
and
his
wits
with
the
bargain
that
they
should
be
paid
back
on
sunday
in
silver
with
the
account
signed
and
a
carlino
more
for
interest
as
was
but
right
for
in
affairs
there
s
no
friendship
that
counts
he
also
bought
a
whole
cargo
of
fish
in
the
lump
with
discount
if
the
poor
fellow
who
had
taken
the
fish
wanted
his
money
down
but
they
must
be
weighed
with
his
scales
that
were
as
false
as
judas
s
so
they
said
to
be
sure
such
fellows
were
never
contented
and
had
one
arm
long
and
the
other
short
like
saint
francesco
and
he
would
advance
the
money
for
the
port
taxes
if
they
wanted
it
and
only
took
the
money
beforehand
and
half
a
pound
of
bread
per
head
and
a
little
quarter
flask
of
wine
and
wanted
no
more
for
he
was
a
christian
and
one
of
those
who
knew
that
for
what
one
does
in
this
world
one
must
answer
to
god
in
short
he
was
a
real
providence
for
all
who
were
in
tight
places
and
had
invented
a
hundred
ways
of
being
useful
to
his
neighbors
and
without
being
a
seaman
he
had
boats
and
tackle
and
everything
for
such
as
hadn
t
them
and
lent
them
contenting
himself
with
a
third
of
the
fish
and
something
for
the
boat
that
counted
as
much
as
the
wages
of
a
man
and
something
more
for
the
tackle
for
he
lent
the
tackle
too
and
the
end
was
that
the
boat
ate
up
all
the
profits
so
that
they
called
it
the
devil
s
boat
and
when
they
asked
him
why
he
didn
t
go
to
sea
too
and
risk
his
own
skin
instead
of
swallowing
everything
at
other
people
s
expense
he
would
say
bravo
and
if
an
accident
happened
lord
avert
it
and
if
i
lost
my
life
who
would
attend
to
my
business
he
did
attend
to
his
business
and
would
have
hired
out
his
very
shirt
but
he
wanted
to
be
paid
without
so
much
talk
and
there
was
no
use
arguing
with
him
because
he
was
deaf
and
more
than
that
wasn
t
quite
right
in
his
head
and
couldn
t
say
anything
but
bargaining
s
no
cheating
or
the
honest
man
is
known
when
now
his
enemies
were
laughing
in
their
sleeves
at
him
on
account
of
those
blessed
lupins
that
the
devil
had
swallowed
and
he
must
say
a
for
bastianazzo
too
when
the
funeral
ceremony
took
place
along
with
the
other
brothers
of
the
happy
death
with
the
bag
over
his
head
the
windows
of
the
little
church
flashed
in
the
sunshine
and
the
sea
was
smooth
and
still
so
that
it
no
longer
seemed
the
same
that
had
robbed
la
longa
of
her
husband
wherefore
the
brothers
were
rather
in
a
hurry
wanting
to
get
away
each
to
his
own
work
now
that
the
weather
had
cleared
up
this
time
the
malavoglia
were
all
there
on
their
knees
before
the
bier
washing
the
pavement
with
their
tears
as
if
the
dead
man
had
been
really
there
inside
those
four
boards
with
the
lupins
round
his
neck
that
uncle
crucifix
had
given
him
on
credit
because
he
had
always
known
padron
ntoni
for
an
honest
man
but
if
they
meant
to
cheat
him
out
of
his
goods
on
the
pretext
that
bastianazzo
was
drowned
they
might
as
well
cheat
our
lord
christ
by
the
holy
devil
himself
he
would
put
padron
ntoni
in
the
hulks
for
it
there
was
law
even
at
trezza
meanwhile
don
giammaria
flung
two
or
three
asperges
of
on
the
bier
and
mastro
cirino
went
round
with
an
extinguisher
putting
out
the
candles
the
brothers
strode
over
the
benches
with
arms
over
their
heads
pulling
off
their
habits
and
uncle
crucifix
went
and
gave
a
pinch
of
snuff
to
padron
ntoni
by
the
way
of
consolation
for
after
all
when
one
is
an
honest
man
one
leaves
a
good
name
behind
one
and
wins
paradise
and
this
is
what
he
had
said
to
those
who
asked
him
about
his
lupins
with
the
malavoglia
i
m
safe
for
they
are
honest
people
and
don
t
mean
to
leave
poor
bastianazzo
in
the
claws
of
the
padron
ntoni
might
see
for
himself
that
everything
had
been
done
without
skimping
in
honor
of
the
dead
so
much
for
the
mass
so
much
for
the
tapers
so
much
for
the
requiem
he
counted
it
all
off
on
his
big
fingers
in
their
white
cotton
gloves
and
the
children
looked
with
open
mouths
at
all
these
things
which
cost
so
much
and
were
for
papa
the
catafalque
the
tapers
the
and
the
baby
seeing
the
lights
and
hearing
the
organ
began
to
laugh
and
to
dance
the
house
by
the
medlar
was
full
of
people
sad
is
the
house
where
there
is
the
visit
for
the
everybody
passing
and
seeing
the
poor
little
orphaned
malavoglia
at
the
door
with
dirty
faces
and
hands
in
their
pockets
shook
their
heads
saying
poor
cousin
maruzza
now
her
hard
times
are
the
neighbors
brought
things
as
the
custom
is
macaroni
eggs
wine
all
the
gifts
of
god
that
one
could
only
finish
if
one
was
really
happy
and
cousin
alfio
mosca
came
with
a
chicken
in
his
hands
take
this
cousin
mena
he
said
i
only
wish
i
d
been
in
your
father
s
place
i
swear
it
at
least
i
should
not
have
been
missed
and
there
would
have
been
none
to
mourn
for
mena
leaning
against
the
kitchen
door
with
her
apron
over
her
face
felt
her
heart
beat
as
if
it
would
fly
out
of
her
breast
like
that
of
the
poor
frightened
bird
she
held
in
her
hand
the
dowry
of
sant
agata
had
gone
down
down
in
the
and
the
people
who
came
to
make
the
visit
of
condolence
in
the
house
by
the
medlar
looked
round
at
the
things
as
if
they
saw
uncle
crucifix
s
claws
already
grasping
at
them
some
sat
perched
on
chairs
and
went
off
without
having
spoken
a
word
like
regular
stockfish
as
they
were
but
whoever
had
a
tongue
in
their
heads
tried
to
keep
up
some
sort
of
conversation
to
drive
away
melancholy
and
to
rouse
those
poor
malavoglia
who
went
on
crying
all
day
long
like
four
fountains
uncle
cipolla
related
how
there
was
a
rise
of
a
franc
to
a
barrel
in
the
price
of
anchovies
which
might
interest
padron
ntoni
if
he
still
had
any
anchovies
on
hand
he
himself
had
reserved
a
hundred
barrels
which
now
came
in
very
well
and
he
talked
of
poor
cousin
bastianazzo
too
rest
his
soul
how
no
one
could
have
expected
it
a
man
like
that
in
the
prime
of
life
and
positively
bursting
with
health
and
strength
poor
fellow
there
was
the
sindaco
too
master
croce
calta
called
also
giufà
with
don
silvestro
the
and
he
stood
sniffing
with
nose
in
the
air
so
that
people
said
he
was
waiting
for
the
wind
to
see
what
way
to
turn
looking
now
at
one
who
was
speaking
now
at
another
as
if
he
were
watching
the
leaves
in
the
wind
in
real
earnest
and
if
he
spoke
he
mumbled
so
no
one
could
hear
him
and
if
don
silvestro
laughed
he
laughed
too
no
funeral
without
laughter
no
marriage
without
the
druggist
s
wife
twisted
about
on
her
chair
with
disgust
at
the
trifling
conversation
sitting
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
a
long
face
as
is
the
custom
in
town
under
such
circumstances
so
that
people
became
dumb
at
the
sight
of
her
as
if
the
corpse
itself
had
been
sitting
there
and
for
this
reason
she
was
called
the
lady
don
silvestro
strutted
about
among
the
women
and
started
forward
every
minute
to
offer
a
chair
to
some
that
he
might
hear
his
new
boots
creak
they
ought
to
be
burned
alive
those
muttered
la
zuppidda
yellow
as
a
lemon
and
she
said
it
aloud
too
right
in
the
face
of
don
silvestro
just
as
if
he
had
been
one
of
the
she
knew
very
well
what
they
were
after
these
bookworms
with
their
shiny
boots
without
stockings
they
were
always
trying
to
slip
into
people
s
houses
to
carry
off
the
dowry
and
the
daughters
tis
not
you
i
want
my
dear
tis
your
money
for
that
she
had
left
her
daughter
barbara
at
home
those
faces
i
don
t
it
s
a
beastly
shame
cried
donna
rosolina
the
priest
s
sister
red
as
a
turke
fanning
herself
with
her
handkerchief
and
she
railed
at
garibaldi
who
had
brought
in
the
taxes
and
nowadays
nobody
could
live
and
nobody
got
married
any
more
as
if
that
mattered
to
donna
rosolina
now
murmured
goosefoot
donna
rosolina
meanwhile
went
on
talking
to
don
silvestro
of
the
lot
of
work
she
had
on
her
hands
thirty
yards
of
warp
on
the
loom
the
beans
to
dry
for
winter
all
the
to
be
made
she
had
a
secret
for
making
it
so
that
it
kept
fresh
all
winter
she
always
got
the
spices
from
town
on
purpose
and
used
the
best
quality
of
salt
a
house
without
a
woman
never
goes
on
well
but
the
woman
must
have
brains
and
know
how
to
use
her
hands
as
she
did

little
geese

now
he

praying
for

sitting
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
pale
and
limp
as

to

looking
at

shaking
his
head
not
knowing
what
to

with
that
big

sticking
in
his
breast

began
but
caught

and
stopped
short
with
the
dear
times
that
are
coming
added
padron

this
year
when
it
hasn

rained
since
saint
clare
and
if
it
wasn

for
this
last
storm
when
the
was
lost
that
was
a
real
blessing
the
famine
this
year
would
be
solid
enough
to
cut
with
a
each
one
talked
of
his
own
trouble
to
comfort
the
malavoglia
and
show
them
that
they
were
not
the
only
ones
that
had
trouble
troubles
old
and
new
some
have
many
and
some
have
few
and
such
as
stood
outside
in
the
garden
looked
up
at
the
sky
to
see
if
there
was
any
chance
of
more
rain
that
was
needed
more
than
bread
was
padron
cipolla
knew
why
it
didn
t
rain
any
longer
as
it
used
to
do
it
rained
no
longer
on
account
of
that
cursed
that
drew
all
the
rain
to
itself
and
carried
it
daddy
tino
and
uncle
mangiacarubbe
at
this
stood
staring
with
open
mouths
for
there
was
precisely
on
the
road
to

one
of
those
very
but
don

began
to
laugh
with
his
hen
s
cackle
ah
ah
ah
and
padron
cipolla
jumped
up
from
the
wall
in
a
fury
and
railed
at
brutes
with
ears
as
long
as
an
ass
didn
t
everybody
know
that
the
telegraph
carried
the
news
from
one
place
to
another
this
was
because
inside
the
wires
there
was
a
certain
fluid
like
the
sap
in
the
vines
and
in
the
same
way
it
sucked
the
rain
out
of
the
sky
and
carried
it
off
where
there
was
more
need
of
it
they
might
go
and
ask
the
apothecary
who
said
it
himself
and
it
was
for
this
reason
that
they
had
made
a
law
that
whoever
broke
the
should
go
to
prison
then
don
silvestro
had
no
more
to
say
and
put
his
tongue
between
his
teeth
saints
of
paradise
some
one
ought
to
cut
down
those
and
burn
them
began
uncle
zuppiddu
but
no
one
listened
to
him
and
to
change
the
subject
looked
round
the
garden
a
nice
piece
of
ground
said
uncle
when
it
is
well
worked
it
gives
food
enough
for
a
whole
the
house
of
the
malavoglia
had
always
been
one
of
the
first
in
trezza
but
now
with
bastianazzo
drowned
and
ntoni
gone
for
a
soldier
and
mena
to
be
married
and
all
those
hungry
little
ones
it
was
a
house
that
leaked
at
every
seam
in
fact
what
could
it
be
worth
the
house
every
one
stretched
out
his
neck
from
the
garden
measuring
the
house
with
his
eye
to
guess
at
the
value
of
it
cursorily
as
it
were
don
silvestro
knew
more
about
it
than
any
one
for
he
had
the
papers
safe
in
the
clerk
s
room
at
aci
castello
will
you
bet
five
francs
that
all
is
not
gold
that
glitters
he
said
showing
the
shining
new
silver
piece
of
money
he
knew
that
there
was
a
mortgage
of
two
francs
the
year
so
he
began
to
count
on
his
fingers
what
would
be
the
worth
of
the
house
with
the
well
and
the
garden
and
all
neither
the
house
nor
the
boat
can
be
sold
for
they
are
security
for
maruzza
s
dowry
said
some
one
else
and
they
began
to
wrangle
about
it
until
their
voices
might
have
been
heard
even
inside
where
the
family
were
mourning
for
the
dead
of
course
cried
don
silvestro
like
a
there
s
the
dowry
padron
cipolla
who
had
spoken
with
padron
ntoni
about
the
marriage
of
his
son
brasi
and
mena
shook
his
head
and
said
nothing
then
said
uncle
cola
nobody
ll
suffer
but
uncle
crucifix
who
loses
his
lupins
that
he
sold
on
they
all
turned
to
look
at
old
crucifix
who
had
come
too
for
appearance
sake
and
stood
straight
up
in
a
corner
listening
to
all
that
was
said
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
nose
up
in
the
air
as
if
he
was
counting
the
beams
and
the
tiles
of
the
roof
to
make
a
valuation
of
the
house
the
most
curious
stretched
their
necks
to
look
at
him
from
the
door
and
winked
at
each
other
as
if
to
point
him
out
he
looks
like
a
bailiff
making
an
inventory
they
sneered
the
gossips
who
had
got
wind
of
the
talk
between
cipolla
and
padron
ntoni
about
the
marriage
said
to
each
other
that
maruzza
must
get
through
her
mourning
and
then
she
could
settle
about
that
marriage
of
mena
s
but
now
la
longa
had
other
things
to
think
of
poor
dear
padron
cipolla
turned
coolly
away
without
a
word
and
when
everybody
was
gone
the
malavoglia
were
left
alone
in
the
court
now
said
padron
ntoni
we
are
ruined
and
the
best
off
of
us
all
is
bastianazzo
who
doesn
t
know
at
these
words
maruzza
began
to
cry
afresh
and
the
boys
seeing
the
people
cry
began
to
roar
again
too
though
it
was
three
days
now
since
papa
was
dead
the
old
man
wandered
about
from
place
to
place
without
knowing
what
he
was
going
to
do
but
maruzza
never
moved
from
the
foot
of
the
bed
as
if
she
had
nothing
left
that
she
could
do
when
she
spoke
she
only
repeated
with
fixed
eyes
as
if
she
had
no
other
idea
in
her
head
now
i
ve
nothing
more
to
no
replied
padron
ntoni
no
we
must
pay
the
debt
to
old
it
won
t
do
to
have
people
saying
honest
men
when
they
grow
poor
become
and
the
thought
of
the
lupins
drove
the
thorn
of
bastianazzo
deeper
into
his
heart
the
let
fall
dry
leaves
and
the
wind
blew
them
here
and
there
about
the
court
he
went
because
i
sent
him
repeated
padron
ntoni
as
the
wind
bears
the
leaves
here
and
there
and
if
i
had
told
him
to
fling
himself
head
foremost
from
the
fariglione
he
would
have
done
it
without
a
word
at
least
he
died
while
the
house
and
the
even
to
the
last
leaf
were
his
own
and
i
who
am
old
am
still
here
long
are
the
days
of
the
poor
maruzza
said
nothing
but
in
her
head
there
was
one
fixed
idea
that
beat
upon
her
brains
and
gnawed
at
her
heart
to
know
if
she
might
what
had
happened
on
that
night
that
was
always
before
her
eyes
and
if
she
shut
them
she
seemed
to
see
the
out
by
the
cape
of
the
mills
where
the
sea
was
blue
and
smooth
and
sprinkled
with
boats
which
looked
like
gulls
in
the
sunshine
and
could
be
counted
one
by
one
that
of
uncle
crucifix
the
other
of
cousin
barrabbas
uncle
cola
s
padron
fortunato
s
bark
that
it
swung
her
head
to
see
and
she
heard
cola
singing
fit
to
split
his
throat
out
of
his
great
bull
s
lungs
while
he
hammered
away
with
his
mallet
and
the
scent
of
the
tar
came
on
the
air
and
cousin
anna
thumped
her
linen
on
the
stone
at
the
and
she
heard
mena
too
crying
quietly
in
the
kitchen
poor
little
thing
said
the
grandfather
to
himself
the
house
has
come
down
about
your
cars
and
he
went
about
touching
one
by
one
all
the
things
that
were
heaped
up
in
the
corner
with
trembling
hands
as
old
men
do
and
seeing
luca
at
the
door
on
whom
they
had
put
his
father
s
big
jacket
that
reached
to
his
heels
he
said
to
him
that
ll
keep
you
warm
at
your
work
we
must
all
work
now
and
you
must
help
for
we
have
to
pay
the
debt
for
the
maruzza
put
her
hands
to
her
ears
that
she
might
not
hear
la
locca
who
perched
on
the
landing
behind
the
door
screamed
all
day
long
with
her
cracked
maniac
s
voice
saying
that
they
must
give
her
back
her
son
and
wouldn
t
listen
to
reason
from
anybody
she
goes
on
like
that
because
she
s
hungry
said
cousin
anna
at
last
now
old
crucifix
is
furious
at
them
all
about
the
lupins
and
won
t
do
anything
for
them
i
ll
go
and
give
her
something
to
eat
and
then
she
ll
go
cousin
anna
poor
dear
had
left
her
linen
and
her
girls
to
go
and
help
cousin
maruzza
who
acted
as
if
she
were
sick
and
if
they
had
left
her
alone
she
wouldn
t
have
lighted
the
fire
or
anything
but
would
have
left
them
all
to
starve
neighbors
should
be
like
the
tiles
on
the
roof
that
carry
water
for
each
meanwhile
the
poor
children
s
lips
were
pale
for
hunger
nunziata
came
to
help
too
and
alessio
with
his
face
black
from
crying
at
seeing
his
mother
cry
looked
after
the
little
boys
crowding
round
him
like
a
brood
of
chickens
that
nunziata
might
have
her
hands
free
you
know
how
to
manage
said
cousin
anna
to
her
and
you
ll
have
your
dowry
ready
in
your
two
hands
when
you
grow
did
not
know
that
there
was
an
idea
of
marrying
her
to
padron
cipolla
s
brasi
to
make
the
mother
forget
her
grief
and
the
first
person
to
tell
it
her
was
alfio
mosca
who
a
few
days
later
came
to
the
garden
gate
on
his
way
back
from
aci
castello
with
his
mena
replied
it
isn
t
true
it
isn
t
true
but
she
was
confused
and
as
he
went
on
telling
her
all
about
how
he
had
heard
it
from
la
vespa
in
the
house
of
uncle
crucifix
all
of
a
sudden
she
turned
red
all
over
cousin
alfio
too
lost
countenance
seeing
the
girl
like
that
with
her
black
kerchief
over
her
head
he
began
to
play
with
the
buttons
of
his
coat
stood
first
on
one
leg
then
on
the
other
and
would
have
given
anything
to
get
away
listen
it
isn
t
my
fault
i
heard
it
in
old
s
court
while
i
was
chopping
up
the
that
was
blown
down
in
the
storm
at
the
santa
clara
you
remember
now
uncle
crucifix
gets
me
to
do
chores
for
him
because
he
won
t
hear
of
la
locca
s
son
ever
since
his
brother
played
him
that
trick
with
the
cargo
of
mena
had
the
string
of
the
gate
in
her
hand
but
couldn
t
make
up
her
mind
to
open
it
and
then
if
it
isn
t
true
why
do
you
blush
she
didn
t
know
that
was
the
truth
and
she
turned
the
round
and
round
that
person
she
knew
only
by
sight
and
hardly
that
alfio
went
on
telling
her
the
whole
litany
of
brasi
cipolla
s
riches
after
uncle
naso
the
butcher
he
was
the
best
match
in
the
place
and
all
the
girls
were
ready
to
eat
him
up
with
their
eyes
mena
listened
with
all
hers
and
all
of
a
sudden
she
made
him
a
low
courtesy
and
went
off
up
the
garden
path
to
the
house
alfio
in
a
fury
went
off
and
scolded
la
vespa
for
telling
him
such
a
lot
of
stupid
lies
getting
him
into
hot
water
with
everybody
uncle
crucifix
told
me
replied
la
vespa
i
don
t
tell
lies
lies
lies
growled
old
crucifix
i
ain
t
going
to
damn
my
soul
for
that
lot
i
heard
it
with
these
ears
i
heard
also
that
the
is
in
maruzza
s
dowry
and
that
there
s
a
mortgage
of
two
francs
a
year
on
the
you
wait
and
you
ll
see
if
i
tell
lies
or
not
continued
la
vespa
leaning
back
against
the
bureau
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
and
looking
at
him
all
the
time
with
the
wickedest
eyes
you
men
are
all
alike
one
can
t
trust
any
of
meanwhile
uncle
crucifix
didn
t
hear
and
instead
of
eating
went
on
talking
about
the
malavoglia
who
were
talking
of
marriages
in
the
family
but
of
the
two
hundred
francs
for
the
lupins
nobody
heard
a
word
eh
cried
la
vespa
losing
patience
if
one
listened
to
you
nobody
would
get
married
at
i
don
t
care
who
gets
married
or
who
doesn
t
i
want
my
own
i
don
t
care
for
anything
if
you
don
t
care
about
it
who
should
i
say
everybody
isn
t
like
you
always
putting
things
and
are
you
in
a
hurry
pray
of
course
i
am
you
have
plenty
of
time
to
wait
you
re
so
young
but
everybody
can
t
wait
till
the
cows
come
home
to
get
it
s
a
bad
year
said
uncle
no
one
has
time
to
think
of
such
things
as
la
vespa
at
this
planted
her
hands
on
her
hips
and
went
off
like
a
as
if
her
own
wasp
s
sting
had
been
on
her
tongue
now
listen
to
what
i
m
going
to
say
after
all
my
living
is
mine
and
i
don
t
need
to
go
about
begging
for
a
husband
what
do
you
mean
by
it
if
you
hadn
t
come
filling
my
head
with
your
flattery
and
nonsense
i
might
have
had
half
a
thousand
husbands
vanni
pizzuti
and
alfio
and
my
cousin
cola
that
was
always
hanging
on
to
my
skirts
before
he
went
for
a
soldier
and
wouldn
t
even
let
me
tie
up
my
stockings
all
of
them
burning
with
impatience
too
they
wouldn
t
have
gone
on
leading
me
by
the
nose
this
way
and
keeping
me
slinging
round
from
easter
until
christmas
as
you
ve
this
time
uncle
crucifix
put
his
hand
behind
his
ear
to
hear
the
better
and
began
to
smooth
her
down
with
good
words
yes
i
know
you
are
a
sensible
girl
for
that
i
am
fond
of
you
and
am
not
like
those
fellows
that
were
after
you
to
nobble
your
land
and
then
to
eat
it
up
at
santuzza
s
it
isn
t
true
you
don
t
love
me
if
you
did
you
wouldn
t
act
this
way
you
would
see
what
i
am
really
thinking
of
all
the
time
yes
you
she
turned
her
back
on
him
and
still
went
on
poking
at
him
as
if
unconsciously
with
her
elbow
i
know
you
don
t
care
for
me
she
said
the
uncle
was
offended
by
this
unkind
suspicion
you
say
these
things
to
draw
me
into
he
began
to
complain
he
not
care
for
his
own
flesh
and
blood
for
she
was
his
own
flesh
and
blood
after
all
as
the
vineyard
was
and
it
would
have
been
his
if
his
brother
hadn
t
taken
it
into
his
head
to
marry
and
bring
the
wasp
into
the
world
and
for
that
he
had
always
kept
her
as
the
apple
of
his
eye
and
thought
only
of
her
good
listen
he
said
i
thought
of
making
over
to
you
the
debt
of
the
malavoglia
in
exchange
for
the
vineyard
which
is
worth
forty
scudi
and
with
the
expenses
and
the
interest
may
even
reach
fifty
scudi
and
you
may
get
hold
even
of
the
house
by
the
medlar
which
is
worth
more
than
the
keep
the
house
by
the
medlar
for
yourself
said
she
i
ll
keep
my
vineyard
i
know
very
well
what
to
do
with
then
uncle
crucifix
also
flew
into
a
rage
and
said
that
she
meant
to
let
it
be
gobbled
up
by
that
beggar
alfio
mosca
who
made
fish
at
her
for
love
of
the
vineyard
and
that
he
wouldn
t
have
him
about
the
house
any
more
and
would
have
her
to
know
that
he
had
blood
in
his
veins
too
i
declare
if
he
isn
t
jealous
cried
the
wasp
of
course
i
m
jealous
said
the
old
man
jealous
as
a
wild
beast
and
he
swore
he
d
pay
five
francs
to
whoever
would
break
alfio
mosca
s
head
for
him
but
would
not
do
it
himself
for
he
was
a
christian
and
in
these
days
honest
men
were
cheated
for
good
faith
dwells
in
the
house
of
the
fool
where
one
may
buy
a
rope
to
hang
one
s
self
the
proof
of
it
was
that
one
might
pass
and
repass
the
house
of
the
malavoglia
till
all
was
blue
until
people
had
begun
to
make
fun
of
him
and
to
say
that
he
made
pilgrimages
to
the
house
by
the
medlar
as
they
did
who
made
vows
to
the
madonna
at
ognino
the
malavoglia
paid
him
with
bows
and
nothing
else
and
the
boys
if
they
saw
him
enter
the
street
ran
off
as
if
they
had
seen
a
bugbear
but
until
now
he
hadn
t
heard
a
word
of
that
money
for
the
lupins
and
all
souls
was
hard
at
hand
and
here
was
padron
ntoni
talking
of
his
granddaughter
s
marriage
he
went
off
and
growled
at
goosefoot
who
had
got
him
into
this
scrape
he
said
to
others
but
the
others
said
he
went
to
cast
sheep
at
the
house
by
the
and
la
locca
who
was
always
wandering
about
there
because
she
had
been
told
that
her
son
had
gone
away
in
the
malavoglia
s
boat
and
she
thought
he
would
come
back
that
way
and
she
should
find
him
there
never
saw
her
brother
crucifix
without
beginning
to
screech
like
a
bird
of
ill
omen
making
him
more
furious
than
ever
this
one
will
drive
me
into
a
mortal
sin
cried
all
souls
is
not
yet
come
answered
goosefoot
gesticulating
as
usual
have
a
little
patience
do
you
want
to
suck
padron
ntoni
s
blood
you
know
very
well
that
you
ve
really
lost
nothing
for
the
lupins
were
good
for
nothing
you
know
he
knew
nothing
he
only
knew
that
his
blood
was
in
god
s
hands
and
that
the
malavoglia
boys
dared
not
play
on
the
landing
when
he
passed
before
goosefoot
s
door
and
if
he
met
alfio
mosca
with
his
who
took
off
his
cap
with
his
sunburnt
face
he
felt
his
blood
boiling
with
jealousy
about
the
vineyard
he
wants
to
entrap
my
niece
for
the
sake
of
the
vineyard
he
grumbled
to
goosefoot
a
lazy
hound
who
does
nothing
but
strut
round
with
that
and
has
nothing
else
in
the
world
a
starving
beggar
a
rascal
who
makes
that
ugly
witch
of
a
niece
of
mine
believe
that
he
s
in
love
with
her
pig
s
face
for
love
of
her
meantime
alfio
mosca
was
not
thinking
of
vespa
at
all
and
if
he
had
any
one
in
his
eye
it
was
rather
padron
ntoni
s
mena
whom
he
saw
every
day
in
the
garden
or
on
the
landing
or
when
she
went
to
look
after
the
hens
in
the
and
if
he
heard
the
pair
of
fowls
he
had
given
her
cackling
in
the
he
felt
something
stir
inside
of
him
and
felt
as
if
he
himself
were
there
in
the
court
of
the
house
by
the
medlar
and
if
he
had
been
something
better
than
a
poor
carter
he
would
have
asked
for
sant
agata
s
hand
in
marriage
and
carried
her
off
in
the
when
he
thought
of
all
these
things
he
felt
as
if
he
had
a
thousand
things
to
say
to
her
and
yet
when
she
was
by
his
tongue
was
tied
and
he
could
only
talk
of
the
weather
or
the
last
load
of
wine
he
had
carried
for
the
santuzza
and
of
the
donkey
who
could
draw
four
quintals
weight
better
than
a
mule
poor
beast
mena
stroked
the
poor
beast
with
her
hand
and
alfio
smiled
as
if
it
had
been
himself
whom
she
had
caressed
ah
if
my
donkey
were
yours
cousin
mena
and
mena
shook
her
head
sadly
and
wished
that
the
malavoglia
had
been
carriers
for
then
her
poor
father
would
not
have
died
the
sea
is
salt
she
said
and
the
sailor
dies
in
the
alfio
who
was
in
a
hurry
to
carry
the
wine
to
santuzza
couldn
t
make
up
his
mind
to
go
but
stayed
chatting
about
the
fine
thing
it
was
to
keep
tavern
and
how
that
trade
never
fell
off
and
if
the
wine
was
dear
one
had
only
to
pour
more
water
into
the
barrels
uncle
santoro
had
grown
rich
in
that
way
and
now
he
only
begged
for
amusement
and
you
do
very
well
carrying
the
wine
do
you
not
asked
mena
yes
in
summer
when
i
can
travel
by
night
and
by
day
both
that
way
i
manage
pretty
well
this
poor
beast
earns
his
living
when
i
shall
have
saved
a
little
money
i
ll
buy
a
mule
and
then
i
can
become
a
real
carrier
like
master
mariano
the
girl
was
listening
intently
to
all
that
alfio
was
saying
and
meanwhile
the
gray
olive
shook
with
a
sound
like
rain
and
strewed
the
path
with
little
dry
curly
leaves
here
is
the
winter
coming
and
all
this
we
talk
of
is
for
the
summer
said
goodman
alfio
mena
followed
with
her
eyes
the
shadows
of
the
clouds
that
floated
over
the
fields
as
if
the
gray
olive
had
melted
and
blown
away
so
the
thoughts
flew
through
her
head
and
she
said
do
you
know
cousin
alfio
there
is
nothing
in
that
story
about
padron
fortunato
cipolla
because
first
we
must
pay
the
debt
for
the
i
m
glad
of
it
said
mosca
so
you
won
t
go
away
from
the
when
ntoni
comes
back
from
being
a
soldier
grandfather
and
all
of
us
will
help
each
other
to
pay
the
debt
mamma

taken
some
linen
to
weave
for
her
the
druggist

said
alfio

at
this
moment
appeared

with
her
distaff
in
her

coming
cried
mena
and
ran
off
into
the
house
alfio
whipped
the
donkey
and
wanted
to
get
away
as
well
but
oh
goodman
alfio

hurry

la
zuppidda

same

last
i
don
t
know
they
give
me
the
wine
in
that
last
was
vinegar
only
fit
for

it
was
that
s
the
way
santuzza
gets
rich
and
to
cheat
the
better
she
wears
the
big
medal
of
the
daughters
of
mary
on
the
front
of
her
dress
nowadays
whoever
wants
to
get
on

take
to
that
trade
else
they
go
backward
like
crabs
as
the
malavoglia
have
now
they
have
fished
up
the

but
cousin

her
nose
among

one
moment

at
the
shore

and
women
together
and
padron
ntoni
mixed
up
with
the
crowd
looked
on
like
the
rest
some
gave
kicks
to
the
poor
to
hear
how
she
was
cracked
as
if
she
no
longer
belonged
to
anybody
and
the
poor
old
man
felt
those
kicks
in
his
own
stomach
a
fine
providence
you
have
said
don
franco
to
him
for
he

to
get
her
down
to
the

before

and
heaps
of

against

at

with

wanted
to
climb
up
into
the
boat
and
to
help
to
fan
the
fire
under
the
kettle
of
pitch
and
when
they
pushed
him
he

say
in
a
threatening
whine
wait
till
my

comes
back
in

if

would
stay
on
six
months
longer
as
a
soldier
he
would
liberate
his
brother
luca
from
the
conscription
but
ntoni
wouldn

stay
even
six
days
longer
now
that
his
father
was
dead

would
have
done
just
as
he
did
if

misfortune
had
come
upon
him
while
he
was
away
from

over

ear
and
a

covered
with

enough
of
him

all
his

him
home
from

moment
the

full
of

just
as
it
had
been
at
the
funeral
of

nobody
thought
of

some
things

much
so

swaggering
with

by
a
train
of
friends
wishing
that
every
day
might
be
sunday
that
he
might
carry
his
pretty
shirts
out
that
afternoon
he
amused
himself
by
wrestling
with
cousin
pizzuti
who
hadn
t
the
fear
of
god
before
his
eyes
though
he
had
never
been
for
a
soldier
and
sent
him
rolling
on
the
ground
before
the
tavern
with
a
bloody
nose
but
rocco
spatu
was
stronger
than
ntoni
and
threw
him
down
in
short
ntoni
amused
himself
the
whole
day
long
and
while
they
were
sitting
chatting
round
the
table
in
the
evening
and
his
mother
asked
him
all
sorts
of
questions
about
one
thing
and
another
and
mena
looked
at
his
cap
and
his
shirt
with
the
stars
to
see
how
they
were
made
and
the
boys
half
asleep
gazed
at
him
with
all
their
eyes
his
grandfather
told
him
that
he
had
found
a
place
for
him
by
the
day
on

bark
at

to
whoever

to
him
sitting
on
the
bench
in

of
the
barber

shop
i
took
him
because
i
couldn
t
bear
to
say
no
when
padron
ntoni
came
to
ask
me
under
the
elm
if
i
wanted
men
for
the
bark
i
never

in
the
morning
when

to
wake
his
grandson
it
wanted
two
hours
to
dawn
and
ntoni
would
have
preferred
to
remain
under
the
blankets
when
he
came
yawning
out
into
the
court
the
three
sticks
were
still
high
over
ognino
and
the
puddara
shone
on
the
other
side
and
all
the
stars
glittered
like
the
sparks
under

over
again

there
in

be
heard
the
people
passing
towards
the
sea
knocking
at
the
doors
as
they
passed
to
rouse
their
companions
all
the
same
when
they
came
to
the
shore
where
the
stars
were
mirrored
in
the
black
smooth
sea
which
murmured
softly
on
the
stones
and
saw
here
and
there
the
lights
of
the
other
boats
ntoni
too
felt
his
heart
swell
within
him
ah
he
exclaimed
with
a

stretch
of

padron
ntoni
ntoni
continued
to
row
growling
all
the
while
as
he
could
not
get
up
and
walk
away
and
cousin
mangiacarubbe
to
put
an
end
to
the
quarrelling
said
it
was
time
for
breakfast
at
that
moment
the
sun
was
just
rising
and
a
draught
of
wine
was
pleasant
in
the
cold
air
which
began
to
blow
so
the
boys
began
to
set
their
jaws
at
work
with
flask
between
their
knees
while
the
bark
moved
slowly
about
inside
the
ring
of
corks
a
kick
to
whoever
speaks
first
said
uncle
cola
not
to
be
kicked
they
all
began
to
chew
like
so
many
oxen
watching
the
waves
that
came
rolling
in
from
the
open
sea
and
spreading
out
without
foam
those
green
billows
that
on
a
fair
sunny
day
remind
one
of
a
black
sky
and
a
sea
padron
cipolla
will
be
swearing
roundly
at
us
said
uncle
cola
but
it
isn
t
our
fault
in
this
fresh
breeze
there
s
no
chance
of
first
goodman
mangiacarubbe
let
fly
a
kick
at
uncle
cola
who
had
broken
silence
himself
after
declaring
the
forfeit
and
then
answered
since
we
are
here
we
may
as
well
leave
the
net
out
a
while
the
tide
is
coming
from
the
open
that
will
help
us
said
padron
ntoni
ay
ay
muttered
uncle
cola
meanwhile
now
that
the
silence
was
broken
barabbas
asked
ntoni
malavoglia
for
a
stump
of
a
cigar
i
haven
t
but
one
said
ntoni
without
thinking
of
the
recent
quarrel
but
i
ll
give
you
half
of
the
crew
of
the
bark
leaning
their
backs
against
the
bench
with
hands
behind
their
heads
hummed
snatches
of
songs
under
their
breath
each
on
his
own
account
to
keep
himself
awake
for
it
was
very
difficult
not
to
doze
in
the
blazing
sun
and
snapped
his
fingers
at
the
fish
which
leaped
flashing
out
of
the
water
they
have
nothing
to
do
said
ntoni
and
they
amuse
themselves
by
jumping
how
good
this
cigar
is
said
barabbas
did
you
smoke
these
at
naples
yes
plenty
of
all
the
same
the
corks
are
beginning
to
sink
said
goodman
mangiacarubbe
do
you
see
where
the
went
down
with
your
father
said
barabbas
to
ntoni
there
at
the
cape
where
the
sun
glints
on
those
white
houses
and
the
sea
seems
as
if
it
were
made
of
the
sea
is
salt
and
the
sailor
sinks
in
the
sea
replied
ntoni
barabbas
passed
him
his
flask
and
they
began
to
mutter
to
each
other
under
their
breath
against
uncle
cola
who
was
a
regular
dog
for
the
crew
of
the
bark
watching
everything
they
said
and
did
they
might
as
well
have
padron
cipolla
himself
on
board
and
all
to
make
him
believe
that
the
boat
couldn
t
get
on
without
him
added
barabbas
an
old
spy
now
he
ll
go
saying
that
it
is
he
that
has
caught
the
fish
by
his
cleverness
in
spite
of
the
rough
sea
look
how
the
nets
are
sinking
the
corks
are
quite
under
water
you
can

see
holloa
boys
shouted
uncle
cola
we
must
draw
in
the
net
or
the
tide
will
sweep
it
the
crew
began
to
vociferate
as
they
passed
the
rope
from
hand
to
hand
saint
francis
cried
uncle
cola
who
would
have
thought
that
we
should
have
taken
all
this
precious
load
in
spite
of
the
tide
the
nets
shivered
and
glittered
in
the
sun
and
all
the
bottom
of
the
boat
seemed
full
of
quicksilver
padron
fortunato
will
be
contented
now
said
barabbas
red
and
sweaty
and
won
t
throw
in
our
faces
those
few
centimes
he
pays
us
for
the
this
is
what
we
get
said
ntoni
to
break
our
backs
for
other
people
and
then
when
we
have
put
a
few
soldi
together
comes
the
devil
and
carries
them
what
are
you
grumbling
about
asked
his

mad
after

and
washing
padron
ntoni
and
his
grandsons
went
out
by
the
day
and
helped
each
other
as
best
they
could
and
when
the
old
man
was
bent
double
with
sciatica
he
stayed
in
the
court
and
mended
nets
and
tackle
of
all
kinds
of
which
trade
he
was
a
master
luca
went
to
work
at
the
bridge
on
the
railroad
for
fifty
centimes
a
day
though
ntoni
said
that
wasn
t
enough
to
pay
for
the
shirts
he
spoiled
by
carrying
loads
on
his
back
but
luca
didn
t
mind
spoiling
his
shirts
or
his
shoulders
either
and
alessio
went
gathering
crabs
and
mussels
on
the
shore
and
sold
them
for
ten
sous
the
pound
and
sometimes
he
went
as
far
as
ognino
or
the
cape
of
the
mills
and
came
back
with
his
feet
all
bloody
but
goodman
zuppiddu
wanted
a
good
sum
every
saturday
for
mending
the
and
one
wanted
a
good
many
nets
to
mend
and
rolls
of
linen
to
weave
and
crabs
at
ten
sous
the
pound
and
linen

come
and
uncle
crucifix
did
nothing
but
promenade
up
and
down
the
little
street
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
like
an
old
basilisk
this
story
will
end
with
a
bailiff

dumbbell
went
on
saying
to

and
to
don
giammaria
the
vicar
there
will
be
no
need
of

bailiff
uncle
crucifix
said
padron
ntoni
when
he
was
told
what
old
had
been
saying
the
malavoglia
have
always
been
honest
people
and
have
paid
their
debts
without
the
aid
of
a
that
does
not
matter
to
me
said
uncle
crucifix
as
he
stood
against
the
wall
of
his
court
measuring
the
cuttings
of
his
vines
i
only
know
i
want
to
be
finally
through
the
interposition
of
the
vicar
consented
to
wait
until
christmas
taking
for
interest
that
francs
which
maruzza
had
managed
to
scrape
together
sou
by
sou
which
she
kept
in
an
old
stocking
hid
under
the
mattress
of
her
bed
this
is
the
way
it
goes
growled
padron
ntoni
s
ntoni
we
work
night
and
day
for
old

when
we
have
managed
to
rake
and
scrape
a

to
give
it
to

with
maruzza
consoled
each

by
building
castles
in
the
air
for
the
summer
when
there
would
be
anchovies
to
be
salted
and
indian
figs
at
ten
for
eight
centimes
and
they
made
fine
projects
of
going
to
the
and
the
fishing
for
the
when
one
gains
a
good
sum
by
the
day
and
in
the
mean
time
cousin
bastian
would
have
put
the
in
order
the
boys
listened
attentively
with
elbows
on
their
knees
to
this
discourse
as
they
sat
on
the
landing
or
after
supper
but
ntoni
who
had
been
in
foreign
ports
and
knew
the
world
better
than
the
others
was
not
amused
by
such
talk
and
preferred
going
to
lounge
about
the
tavern
where
there
was
a
lot
of
people
who
did
nothing
and
old
uncle
santoro
the
worst
of
them
who
had
only
that
easy
trade
of
begging
to
follow
and
sat
muttering
ave
marias
or
he
went
down
to
master
zuppiddu
s
to
see
how
the
was
getting
on
to
have
a
little
talk
with
barbara
who
came
out
with
fagots
for
the
fire
under
the
kettle
of
pitch
when

the
christmas
season
drew
on
the
malavoglia
were
always
in
and
out
of
master
bastiano
zuppiddu
s
court
meanwhile
the
whole
place
was
assuming
a
festive
appearance
in
every
house
the
images
of
the
saints
were
adorned
with
boughs
and
with
oranges
and
the
children
ran
about
in
crowds
after
the
pipers
who
came
playing
before
the
shrines
with
the
lamps
before
the
doors
only
in
the
malavoglia
s
house
the
statue
of
the
good
shepherd
stood
dark
and
unadorned
while
padron
ntoni
s
ntoni
ran
here
and
there
like
a
rooster
in
the
spring
and
barbara
zuppidda
said
to
him
at
least
you
ll
remember
how
i
melted
the
pitch
for
the
when
you
re
out
at
goosefoot
prophesied
that
all
the
girls
would
want
to
rob
her
of
him
it
s
i
who
am
robbed
whined
uncle
crucifix
where
am
i
to
get
the
money
for
the
lupins
if
ntoni
marries
and
they
take
off
the
dowry
for
mena
and
the
mortgage
that
s
on
the
house
and
all
the
burdens
besides
that
came
out
at
the
very
last
minute
christmas
is
here
but
no
padron
ntoni
went
to
him
in
the
piazza
or
in
his
own
court
and
said
to
him
what
can
i
do
if
i
have
no
money
wait
till
june
if
you
will
do
me
that
favor
or
take
the
boat
or
the
house
i
have
nothing
i
want
my
money
repeated
uncle
crucifix
with
his
back
against
the
wall
you
said
you
were
honest
people
you
can
t
pay
me
with
talk
about
the
or
the
house
by
the
he
was
ruining
both
body
and
soul
had
lost
sleep
and
appetite
and
wasn
t
even
allowed
to
relieve
his
feelings
by
saying
that
the
end
of
this
story
would
be
the
bailiff
because
if
he
did
padron
ntoni
sent
straightway
don
giammaria
or
don
silvestro
to
beg
for
pity
on
him
and
they
didn
t
even
leave
him
in
peace
in
the
piazza
where
he
couldn
t
go
on
his
own
business
without
some
one
was
at
his
heels
so
that
the
whole
place
cried
out
on
the
devil
s
money
with
goosefoot
he
couldn
t
talk
because
he
always
threw
in
his
face
that
the
lupins
were
rotten
and
that
he
had
done
the
broker
for
him
but
that
service
he
could
do
me
said
he
suddenly
to
himself
and
that
night
he
did
not
sleep
another
wink
so
charmed
was
he
with
the
discovery
and
he
went
off
to
goosefoot
as
soon
as
it
was
day
and
found
him
yawning
and
stretching
at
his
house
door
you
must
pretend
to
buy
my
debt
he
said
to
him
and
then
we
can
send
the
officers
to
malavoglia
and
nobody
will
call
you
a
usurer
or
say
that
yours
is
the
devil
s
did
this
fine
idea
come
to
you
in
the
night
sneered
goosefoot
that
you
come
waking
me
at
dawn
to
tell
it
me
i
came
to
tell
you
about
those
cuttings
too
if
you
want
them
you
may
come
and
take
then
you
may
send
for
the
bailiff
said
but
you
must
pay
the
before
every
house
the
shrines
were
adorned
with
leaves
and
oranges
and
at
evening
the
candles
were
lighted
when
the
pipers
played
and
sang
litanies
so
that
it
was
a
festa
everywhere
the
boys
played
at
games
with
in
the
street
and
if
alessio
stopped
with
legs
apart
to
look
on
they
said
to
him
go
away
you
you
haven
t
any
nuts
to
play
with
now
they
re
going
to
take
away
your
in
fact
on
christmas
eve
the
officer
came
in
a
carriage
to
the
malavoglia
s
so
that
the
whole
village
was
upset
by
it
and
he
went
and
left
a
paper
with
a
stamp
on
it
on
the
bureau
beside
the
image
of
the
good
shepherd
the
malavoglia
seemed
as
if
they
all
had
been
struck
by
apoplexy
at
once
and
stayed
in
the
court
sitting
in
a
ring
doing
nothing
and
that
day
that
the
bailiff
came
there
was
no
table
set
in
the
house
of
the
malavoglia
what
shall
we
do
said
la
longa
padron
ntoni
did
not
know
what
to
say
but
at
last
he
took
the
paper
and
went
off
with
his
two
eldest
grandsons
to
uncle
crucifix
to
tell
him
to
take
the
which
master
bastiano
had
just
finished
mending
and
the
poor
old
man
s
voice
trembled
as
it
did
when
he
lost
his
son
bastianazzo
i
know
nothing
about
it
replied
i
have
no
more
to
do
with
the
business
i
ve
sold
my
debt
to
goosefoot
and
you
must
manage
it
the
best
way
you
can
with
goosefoot
began
to
scratch
his
head
as
soon
as
he
saw
them
coming
in
procession
to
speak
to
him
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
answered
he
i
m
a
poor
devil
i
need
the
money
and
i
can
t
do
anything
with
the
boat
that
isn
t
my
trade
but
if
uncle
crucifix
will
buy
it
i
ll
help
you
to
sell
it
i
ll
be
back
so
the
poor
fellows
sat
on
the
wall
waiting
and
casting
longing
glances
down
the
road
where
old
goosefoot
had
disappeared
not
daring
to
look
each
other
in
the
face
at
last
he
came
limping
slowly
along
he
got
on
fast
enough
when
he
liked
in
spite
of
his
crooked
leg
he
says
it
s
all
broken
like
an
old
shoe
he
wouldn
t
hear
of
taking
it
he
called
out
from
a
distance
i
m
sorry
but
i
could
do
so
the
malavoglia
went
off
home
again
with
their
stamped
paper
but
something
had
to
be
done
for
that
piece
of
stamped
paper
lying
on
the
bureau
had
power
they
had
been
told
to
devour
the
bureau
and
the
house
and
the
whole
family
into
the
bargain
here
we
need
advice
from
don
silvestro
suggested
maruzza
take
these
two
hens
to
him
and
he
ll
be
sure
to
know
of
something
you
can
don
silvestro
said
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
and
he
sent
them
to
a
clever
lawyer
scipione
who
lived
in
the
street
of
the
opposite
uncle
crispino
s
stable
and
was
young
but
from
what
he
had
been
told
had
brains
enough
to
put
in
his
pocket
all
the
old
fellows
who
asked
five
scudi
for
opening
their
mouths
while
he
was
contented
with
lire
the
lawyer
was
rolling
cigarettes
and
he
made
them
come
and
go
two
or
three
times
before
he
would
let
them
come
in
the
finest
thing
about
it
was
that
they
all
went
in
procession
one
behind
the
other
at
first
they
were
accompanied
by
la
longa
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
as
she
wished
to
give
her
opinion
too
on
the
subject
and
so
they
lost
a
whole
day
s
work
when
however
the
lawyer
had
read
the
papers
and
could
manage
to
understand
something
of
the
confused
answers
which
he
had
to
tear
as
if
with
pincers
from
padron
ntoni
while
the
others
sat
perched
up
on
their
chairs
without
daring
even
to
breathe
he
began
to
laugh
heartily
and
the
malavoglia
laughed
too
with
him
without
knowing
why
just
to
get
their
breath
nothing
replied
the
lawyer
you
need
do
and
when
padron
ntoni
told
him
again
that
the
bailiff
had
come
to
the
house
let
the
bailiff
come
every
day
if
he
likes
so
the
creditors
will
the
sooner
tire
of
the
expense
of
sending
him
they
can
take
nothing
from
you
because
the
house
is
settled
on
your
son
s
wife
and
for
the
boat
we
ll
make
a
claim
on
the
part
of
master
bastiano
zuppiddu
your
did
not
take
part
in
the
purchase
of
the
the
lawyer
went
on
talking
without
drawing
breath
without
scratching
his
head
even
for
more
than
lire
so
that
padron
ntoni
and
his
grandson
felt
a
great
longing
to
talk
too
to
bring
out
that
fine
defence
of
theirs
of
which
their
heads
were
full
and
they
went
away
stunned
overpowered
by
all
these
wonderful
things
ruminating
and
gesticulating
over
the
lawyer
s
speech
all
the
way
home
maruzza
who
hadn
t
been
with
them
that
time
seeing
them
come
with
bright
eyes
and
rosy
faces
felt
herself
relieved
of
a
great
weight
and
with
a
serene
aspect
waited
to
hear
what
the
advocate
had
said
but
no
one
said
a
word
and
they
all
stood
looking
at
each
other
well
asked
maruzza
who
was
dying
of
impatience
nothing
we
need
fear
nothing
replied
padron
ntoni
tranquilly
and
the
advocate
yes
the
advocate
says
we
need
fear
but
what
did
he
say
persisted
maruzza
ah
he
knows
how
to
talk
a
man
with
whiskers
blessed
be
those
lire
but
what
did
he
tell
you
to
do
the
grandfather
looked
at
the
grandson
and
ntoni
looked
back
at
his
grandfather
nothing
answered
padron
ntoni
he
told
us
to
do
we
won
t
pay
anything
cried
ntoni
boldly
because
they
can
t
take
either
the
house
or
the
provvidenza
we
don
t
owe
them
and
the
lupins
the
lupins
we
didn
t
eat
them
his
lupins
we
haven
t
got
them
in
our
pockets
and
uncle
crucifix
can
take
nothing
from
us
the
advocate
said
so
said
he
was
spending
money
for
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
but
maruzza
was
still
unconvinced
so
he
told
you
not
to
pay
ntoni
scratched
his
head
and
his
grandfather
added
it
s
true
the
lupins
we
had
them
we
must
pay
for
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
now
that
the
lawyer
was
no
longer
there
they
must
pay
padron
ntoni
shook
his
head
muttering
not
that
not
that
the
malavoglia
have
never
done
that
uncle
crucifix
may
take
the
house
and
the
boat
and
everything
but
we
can
t
do
the
poor
old
man
was
confused
but
his
cried
silently
behind
her
apron
then
we
must
go
to
don
silvestro
concluded
padron
ntoni
and
with
one
accord
grandfather
grandchildren
and
with
the
little
girl
proceeded
once
more
in
procession
to
the
house
of
the
communal
secretary
to
ask
him
how
they
were
to
manage
about
paying
the
debt
and
preventing
uncle
crucifix
from
sending
any
more
stamped
paper
to
eat
up
the
house
and
the
boat
and
the
family
don
silvestro
who
understood
law
was
amusing
himself
by
constructing
a
intended
as
a
present
for
the
children
of
her
he
did
not
do
as
the
lawyer
did
he
let
them
talk
and
talk
continuing
silently
to
sharpen
his
reeds
and
fasten
them
into
their
places
at
last
he
told
them
what
was
necessary
well
now
if
madam
maruzza
is
willing
to
put
her
hand
to
it
everything
may
be
the
poor
woman
could
not
guess
where
she
was
to
put
her
hand
you
must
put
it
into
the
sale
said
don
silvestro
to
her
and
give
up
your
dotal
mortgage
although
you
did
not
buy
the
we
all
bought
the
lupins
together
murmured
the
poor
longa
and
the
lord
has
punished
us
all
together
by
taking
away
my
the
poor
ignorant
creatures
motionless
on
their
chairs
looked
at
each
other
and
don
silvestro
laughed
to
himself
then
he
sent
for
uncle
crucifix
who
came
gnawing
a
dried
chestnut
having
just
finished
his
dinner
and
his
eyes
were
even
more
glassy
than
usual
from
the
very
first
he
would
listen
to
nothing
declaring
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
that
it
was
no
longer
his
affair
i
am
like
the
low
wall
that
everybody
sits
and
leans
on
as
much
as
he
pleases
because
i
can
t
talk
like
an
advocate
and
give
all
my
reasons
properly
my
property
is
treated
as
if
i
had
stolen
and
so
he
went
on
grumbling
and
muttering
with
his
back
against
the
wall
and
his
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
and
nobody
could
understand
a
word
he
said
on
account
of
the
chestnut
which
he
had
in
his
mouth
don
silvestro
spoiled
a
shirt
by
sweating
over
the
attempt
to
make
him
understand
how
the
malavoglia
were
not
to
be
called
cheats
if
they
were
willing
to
pay
the
debt
and
if
the
widow
gave
up
her
dotal
rights
the
malavoglia
would
be
willing
to
give
up
everything
but
their
shirts
sooner
than
go
to
law
but
if
they
were
driven
to
the
wall
they
might
begin
to
send
stamped
paper
as
well
as
other
people
such
things
have
happened
before
now
in
short
a
little
charity
one
must
have
by
the
holy
devil
what
will
you
bet
that
if
you
go
on
planting
your
feet
like
a
mule
in
this
you
don
t
lose
the
whole
thing
and
uncle
crucifix
replied
if
you
take
me
on
that
side
i
haven
t
any
more
to
and
he
promised
to
speak
to
old
goosefoot
for
friendship
s
sake
i
would
make
any
padron
ntoni
could
speak
for
him
how
for
friendship
s
sake
he
had
done
as
much
as
that
and
more
and
he
offered
him
his
open
snuffbox
and
stroked
the
baby
s
cheek
and
gave
her
a
chestnut
don
silvestro
knows
my
weakness
i
don
t
know
how
to
say
no
this
evening
i
ll
speak
to
goosefoot
and
tell
him
to
wait
until
easter
if
cousin
maruzza
will
put
her
hand
to
cousin
maruzza
did
not
know
where
her
hand
was
to
be
put
but
said
that
she
was
ready
to
put
it
immediately
then
you
can
send
for
those
beans
that
you
said
you
wanted
to
sow
said
uncle
crucifix
to
don
silvestro
before
he
went
away
all
right
all
right
replied
don
silvestro
we
all
know
that
for
your
friends
you
have
a
heart
as
big
as
the
goosefoot
while
any
one
was
by
wouldn
t
hear
of
any
delay
and
screamed
and
tore
his
hair
and
swore
they
wanted
to
reduce
him
to
his
last
shirt
and
to
leave
him
without
bread
for
the
winter
him
and
his
wife
grace
since
they
had
persuaded
him
to
buy
the
debt
of
the
malavoglia
and
that
those
were
five
hundred
lire
one
better
than
another
that
they
had
coaxed
him
out
of
to
give
them
to
uncle
crucifix
his
wife
grace
poor
thing
opened
her
eyes
very
wide
because
she
couldn
t
tell
where
all
that
money
had
come
from
and
put
in
a
good
word
for
the
malavoglia
who
were
all
good
people
and
everybody
in
the
vicinity
had
always
known
they
were
honest
and
uncle
crucifix
himself
now
began
to
take
the
part
of
the
malavoglia
they
have
said
they
will
pay
and
if
they
don
t
they
will
let
you
have
the
house
madam
maruzza
will
put
her
hand
to
it
don
t
you
know
that
in
these
days
if
you
want
your
own
you
must
do
the
best
you
can
then
goosefoot
put
on
his
jacket
in
a
great
hurry
and
went
off
swearing
and
blaspheming
saying
that
his
wife
and
old
crucifix
might
do
as
they
pleased
since
he
was
no
longer
master
in
his
own
house
vii
was
a
black
christmas
for
the
malavoglia
just
then
luca
had
to
draw
his
number
for
the
conscription
a
low
number
too
like
a
poor
devil
as
he
was
and
he
went
off
without
many
tears
they
were
used
to
it
by
this
time
this
time
also
ntoni
accompanied
his
brother
with
his
cap
over
his
ear
so
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
he
who
was
going
away
and
he
kept
on
saying
that
it
was
nothing
that
he
had
been
for
a
soldier
himself
that
day
it
rained
and
the
street
was
all
one
puddle
i
don
t
want
you
to
come
with
me
repeated
luca
to
his
mother
the
station
is
a
long
way
and
he
stood
at
the
door
watching
the
rain
come
down
on
the
with
his
little
bundle
under
his
arm
then
he
kissed
the
hands
of
his
mother
and
his
grandfather
and
embraced
mena
and
the
children
so
la
longa
saw
him
go
away
under
the
umbrella
accompanied
by
all
his
relations
jumping
from
stone
to
stone
in
the
little
alley
that
was
all
one
puddle
and
the
boy
who
was
as
wise
as
his
grandfather
himself
turned
up
his
trousers
on
the
landing
although
he
wouldn
t
have
to
wear
them
any
more
when
he
got
his
this
one
won
t
write
home
for
money
when
he
is
down
there
thought
the
old
man
and
if
god
grants
him
life
he
will
bring
up
once
more
the
house
by
the
but
god
did
not
grant
him
life
just
because
he
was
that
sort
of
a
fellow
and
when
there
came
later
on
the
news
of
his
death
a
thorn
remained
in
his
mother
s
heart
because
she
had
let
him
go
away
in
the
rain
and
had
not
accompanied
him
to
the
station
mamma
said
luca
turning
back
because
his
heart
bled
to
leave
her
so
silent
on
the
landing
looking
like
our
lady
of
sorrows
when
i
come
back
i
ll
let
you
know
first
and
then
you
can
come
and
meet
me
at
the
and
these
words
maruzza
never
forgot
while
she
lived
and
till
her
death
she
bore
also
that
other
thorn
in
her
heart
that
her
boy
had
not
been
present
at
the
festa
that
was
made
when
the
was
launched
anew
while
all
the
place
was
there
and
barbara
zuppidda
came
out
with
the
broom
to
sweep
away
the
shavings
i
do
it
for
your
sake
she
said
to
padron
ntoni
s
ntoni
because

the
broom
in
your
hand

like
a
queen

the
madonna
of

a
chance
to
breathe
now
that
the
has
been
scarcely
had
master
turi
said
that
the
boat
was
in
order
than
padron
ntoni
went
off
to
start
her
with
his
boys
and
all
the
neighbors
and
the
when
she
was
going
down
to
the
sea
rocked
about
on
the
stones
as
if
she
were
among
the
crowd
this
way
here
called
out
cousin
zuppiddu
louder
than
anybody
but
the
others
shouted
and
struggled
to
push
her
back
on
the
ways
as
she
rocked
over
on
the
stones
let
me
do
it
or
else
i
ll
just
take
the
boat
up
in
my
arms
like
a
baby
and
put
her
in
the
water
master
turi
is
capable
of
doing
it
with
those
arms
of
his
said
some
one
or
else
now
the
malavoglia
will
be
all
right
that
devil
of
a
cousin
zuppiddu
has
lucky
fingers
they
exclaimed
look
how
he
has
put
her
straight
again
when
she
was
like
an
old
and
in
truth
the
did
seem
quite
another
with
new
pitch
and
with
a
bright
red
line
along
her
side
and
on
the
prow
san
francesco
with
his
beard
that
seemed
to
have
been
made
of
tow
so
much
so
that
even
la
longa
had
made
peace
with
the
whom
she
had
never
forgiven
for
coming
back
to
her
without
her
husband
but
she
made
peace
for
fright
now
that
the
bailiff
had
been
in
the
house
viva
san
francesco
called
out
every
one
as
the
passed
and
la
locca
s
son
called
out
louder
than
anybody
in
the
hope
that
now
padron
ntoni
would
hire
him
by
the
day
instead
of
his
brother
menico
mena
stood
on
the
landing
and
once
more
she
cried
for
joy
and
at
last
even
la
locca
got
up
like
the
rest
and
followed
the
malavoglia

live
here
alone
like
a
mena
didn
t
know
what
to
say
and
alfio
added
now
that
the
has
put
to
sea
again
you
ll
be
married
to
brasi
grandpapa
has
said
nothing
about
he
will
there
s
still
time
between
now
and
your
marriage
who
knows
how
many
things
may
happen
or
by
what
different
roads
i
shall
drive
my
cart
i
have
been
told
that
in
the
plain
at
the
other
side
of
the
town
there
is
work
for
everybody
on
the
railroad
now
that
santuzza
has
arranged
with
master
philip
for
the
new
wine
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
meanwhile
the
had
slipped
into
the
sea
like
a
duck
with
her
beak
in
the
air
and
danced
on
the
green
water
enjoying
its
coolness
while
the
sun
glanced
on
her
shining
side
padron
ntoni
enjoyed
it
too
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
his
legs
apart
drawing
his
brows
together
as
sailors
do
when
they
want
to
see
clearly
in
the
sunshine
for
it
was
a
fine
winter
s
day
and
the
fields
were
green
and
the
sea
shining
and
the
deep
blue
sky
had
no
end
so
return
the
sunshine
and
the
sweet
winter
mornings
for
the
eyes
that
have
wept
to
whom
the
sky
has
seemed
black
as
pitch
and
so
all
things
renew
themselves
like
the
for
which
a
few
pounds
of
tar
and
a
handful
of
boards
sufficed
to
make
her
new
once
more
and
the
eyes
that
see
not
these
things
are
those
that
are
done
with
weeping
and
are
closed
in
death
bastianazzo
is
not
here
to
see
this
holiday
thought
maruzza
as
she
went
to
and
fro
arranging
things
in
the
house
and
about
the
loom
where
almost
everything
had
been
her
husband
s
work
on
sundays
or
rainy
days
and
those
hooks
and
shelves
he
had
fixed
in
the
wall
with
his
own
hands
everything
in
the
house
was
full
of
him
from
his
cape
in
the
corner
to
his
boots
under
the
bed
that
were
almost
new
mena
setting
up
the
warp
had
a
sad
heart
too
for
she
was
thinking
of
alfio
who
was
going
away
and
would
have
sold
his
donkey
poor
beast
for
the
young
have
short
memories
and
have
only
eyes
for
the
rising
sun
and
no
one
looks
westward
save
the
old
who
have
seen
the
sun
rise
and
set
so
many
times
now
that
the
has
put
to
sea
again
said
maruzza
at
last
noticing
that
her
daughter
was
still
pensive
your
grandfather
has
begun
to
go
with
master
cipolla
again
i
saw
them
this
morning
from
the
landing
before
peppi
naso
s
padron
fortunato
is
rich
and
has
nothing
to
do
and
stays
all
day
in
the
piazza
answered
mena
yes
and
his
son
brasi
has
plenty
of
the
gifts
of
god
now
that
we
have
our
boat
and
our
men
no
longer
need
to
go
out
by
the
day
to
work
for
others
we
shall
get
out
of
this
tangle
and
if
the
souls
in
purgatory
will
help
us
to
get
rid
of
the
debt
for
the
lupins
we
shall
be
able
to
think
of
other
things
your
grandfather
is
don
t
you
fear
and
he
won
t
let
you
feel
that
you
have
lost
your
father
he
will
be
another
father
to
shortly
after
arrived
padron
ntoni
loaded
with
nets
so
that
he
looked
like
a
mountain
and
you
couldn
t
see
his
face
i
ve
been
to
get
them
out
of
the
bark
he
said
and
i
must
look
over
the
meshes
for
we
must
rig
the
why
did
you
not
get
ntoni
to
help
you
answered
maruzza
pulling
at
one
end
of
the
net
while
the
old
man
turned
round
in
the
middle
of
the
court
like
a
winder
to
unwind
the
nets
which
seemed
to
have
no
end
and
looked
like
a
great
serpent
trailing
along
i
left
him
there
at
the
barber
s
shop
poor
boy
he
has
to
work
all
the
week
and
it
is
hot
even
in
january
with
all
this
stuff
on
one
s
alessio
laughed
to
see
his
grandfather
so
red
and
bent
round
like
a
and
the
grandsire
said
to
him
look
outside
there
there
is
that
poor
locca
her
son
is
in
the
piazza
with
nothing
to
do
and
they
have
nothing
to
maruzza
sent
alessio
to
la
locca
with
some
beans
and
the
old
man
drying
his
forehead
with
the
sleeve
of
his
shirt
added
now
that
we
have
our
boat
if
we
live
till
summer
with
the
help
of
god
we
ll
pay
the
he
had
no
more
to
say
but
sat
under
the
looking
at
his
nets
as
if
he
saw
them
filled
with
fish
now
we
must
lay
in
the
salt
he
said
after
a
while
before
they
raise
the
tax
if
it
is
true
it
is
to
be
raised
cousin
zuppiddu
must
be
paid
with
the
first
money
we
get
and
he
has
promised
that
he
will
then
furnish
the
barrels
on
in
the
chest
of
drawers
there
is
mena
s
linen
which
is
worth
five
scudi
added
maruzza
bravo
with
old
crucifix
i
won
t
make
any
more
debts
because
i
have
had
a
warning
in
the
affair
of
the
lupins
but
he
will
give
us
thirty
francs
for
the
first
time

cried
la
longa
uncle
crucifix
s
money
brings
ill
luck
just
this
last
night
i
heard
the
black
hen
poor
thing
cried
the
old
man
smiling
as
he
watched
the
black
hen
crossing
the
court
with
her
tail
in
the
air
and
her
crest
on
one
side
as
if
the
whole
affair
were
no
business
of
hers
she
lays
an
egg
every
day
all
the
then
mena
spoke
up
and
coming
to
the
door
said
there

a
basketful
of
eggs
and
on
monday

said
padron
ntoni
but
you

eat
an
egg
yourselves
now
and
then
if
you
feel
to
want
no
we
don
t
need
them
said
maruzza
and
mena
added
if
we
eat
them
they
won
t
be
sold
in
the
market
by
cousin
alfio
and
now
we
will
put
duck
s
eggs
under
the
setting
hen
the
ducklings
can
be
sold
for
forty
centimes
her
grandfather
looked
her
in
the
face
and
said
you
re
a
real
malavoglia
my
girl
the
hens
scratched
in
the
sand
of
the
court
in
the
sun
and
the
setting
hen
looking
perfectly
silly
with
the
feather
over
her
beak
shook
herself
in
a
corner
under
the
green
boughs
in
the
garden
along
the
wall
there
was
more
linen
bleaching
with
a
stone
lying
on
it
to
keep
it
from
blowing
away
all
this
is
good
to
make
money
said
ntoni
and
with
the
help
of
god
we
shall
stay
in
our
house
my
house
is
my
now
the
malavoglia
must
pray
to
god
and
saint
francis
for
a
plentiful
fishing
said
meanwhile
yes
with
the
times
we
re
having
exclaimed
padron
cipolla
they
must
have
sown
the
cholera
for
the
fish
in
the
sea
i
should
mangiacarubbe
nodded
and
uncle
cola
began
to
talk
of
the
tax
that
they
wanted
to
put
on
salt
and
how
if
they
did
that
the
anchovies
might
be
quiet
and
fear
no
longer
the
wheels
of
the
steamers
for
no
one
would
find
it
worth
his
while
to
fish
for
them
any
more
and
they
have
invented
something
else
added
master
turi
the
calker
to
put
a
duty
on
those
to
whom
pitch
was
of
no
importance
had
nothing
to
say
but
zuppiddu
went
on
shouting
that
he
should
shut
up
shop
and
whoever
wanted
a
boat
mended
might
stuff
the
hole
with
his
wife
s
dress
then
they
began
to
scold
and
to
swear
at
this
moment
was
heard
the
scream
of
the
engine
and
the
big
wagons
of
the
railway
came
rushing
out
all
of
a
sudden
from
the
hole
they
had
made
in
the
hill
smoking
and
fuming
as
if
the
devil
was
in
them
there
cried
padron
the
railroad
one
side
and
the
steamers
the
other
upon
my
word
it
s
impossible
to
live
in
peace
at
trezza
in
the
village
there
was
the
devil
to
pay
when
they
wanted
to
put
the
tax
upon
pitch
la
foaming
at
the
mouth
mounted
upon
her
balcony
and
went
on
preaching
that
this
was
some
new
villany
of
don
silvestro
who
wanted
to
bring
the
whole
place
to
ruin
because
they
the
wouldn
t
have
him
for
a
husband
for
their
daughter
they
wouldn
t
have
him
even
for
a
companion
in
the
procession
neither
she
nor
her
girl
when
madam
venera
spoke
of
her
daughter
s
husband
it
always
seemed
as
if
she
herself
were
the
bride
master
turi
zuppiddu
tramped
about
the
landing
mallet
in
hand
brandishing
his
chisel
as
if
he
wanted
to
shed
somebody
s
blood
and
wasn
t
to
be
held
even
by
chains
the
bile
ran
high
from
door
to
door
like
the
waves
of
the
sea
in
a
storm
don
franco
rubbed
his
hands
with
his
great
ugly
hat
on
his
head
saying
that
the
people
was
raising
its
head
and
seeing
don
michele
pass
with
pistols
hanging
at
his
belt
laughed
in
his
face
the
men
too
one
by
one
allowed
themselves
to
be
worked
up
by
their
womankind
and
began
hunting
each
other
up
to
try
and
rouse
each
other
to
fury
losing
the
whole
day
standing
about
in
the
piazza
with
arms
akimbo
and
open
mouths
listening
to
the
apothecary
who
went
on
speechifying
but
under
his
breath
for
fear
of
his
wife
how
they
ought
to
make
a
revolution
if
they
weren
t
fools
and
not
to
mind
the
tax
on
salt
or
the
tax
on
pitch
but
to
clear
off
the
whole
thing
for
the
king
ought
to
be
the
people
instead
some
turned
their
backs
muttering
he
wants
to
be
king
himself
the
druggist
belongs
to
those
of
the
revolution
who
want
to
starve
the
poor
and
they
went
off
to
the
inn
to
santuzza
where
there
was
good
wine
to
heat
one
s
head
and
master
cinghialenta
and
rocco
spatu
made
noise
enough
for
ten
dazio
french
octroi
tax
on
substances
entering
a
town
levied
by
the
the
good
wine
made
them
shout
and
shouting
made
them
thirsty
for
the
tax
had
not
yet
been
raised
on
the
wine
and
such
as
had
much
shook
their
fists
in
the
air
with
rolled
up
raging
even
at
the
flies
vanni
pizzuti
had
closed
his
shop
door
because
no
one
came
to
be
shaved
and
went
about
with
his
razor
in
his
pocket
calling
out
bad
names
from
a
distance
and
spitting
at
those
who
went
about
their
own
business
with
oars
on
their
backs
shrugging
their
shoulders
at
the
noise
uncle
crucifix
who
was
one
of
those
who
attended
to
their
own
affairs
and
when
they
drew
his
blood
with
taxes
held
his
tongue
for
fear
of
worse
and
kept
his
bile
inside
of
him
was
never
seen
in
the
piazza
now
leaning
against
the
wall
of
the
but
kept
inside
his
house
reciting
paternosters
and
ave
marias
to
keep
down
his
rage
against
those
who
were
making
all
the
row
a
lot
of
fellows
who
wanted
to
put
the
place
to
sack
and
to
rob
everybody
who
had
twenty
centimes
in
his
pocket
whoever
like
padron
cipolla
or
master
filippo
the
ortolano
had
anything
to
lose
stayed
shut
up
at
home
with
doors
bolted
and
didn
t
put
out
even
their
noses
so
that
brasi
cipolla
got
a
rousing
cuff
from
his
father
who
found
him
at
the
door
of
the
court
staring
into
the
piazza
like
a
great
stupid
codfish
the
big
fish
stayed
under
water
while
the
waves
ran
high
and
did
not
make
their
appearance
not
even
those
who
were
as
venera
said
but
left
the
syndic
with
his
nose
in
the
air
counting
his
papers
don
t
you
see
that
they
treat
you
like
a
screamed
his
daughter
betta
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
now
that
they
have
got
you
into
a
scrape
they
turn
their
backs
on
you
and
leave
you
alone
wallowing
in
the
mud
that
s
what
it
means
to
let
one
s
self
be
led
by
the
hose
by
that
meddling
don
i
m
not
led
by
the
nose
by
anybody
shouted
the
it
is
i
who
am
syndic
not
don
don
silvestro
on
the
contrary
said
the
real
syndic
was
his
daughter
betta
and
that
master
croce
calta
wore
the
breeches
by
mistake
he
still
went
about
and
about
with
that
red
face
of
his
and
rocco
spatu
and
cinghialenta
when
they
saw
him
went
into
the
tavern
for
fear
of
a
mess
and
vanni
pizzuti
swore
loudly
tapping
his
razor
in
his
all
the
time
don
silvestro
without
noticing
them
went
to
say
a
word
or
two
to
uncle
santoro
and
put
two
centimes
into
his
hand
the
lord
be
praised
cried
the
blind
man
this
is
don
silvestro
the
secretary
none
of
these
others
that
come
here
roaring
and
thumping
their
stomachs
ever
give
a
centime
in
alms
for
the
souls
in
purgatory
and
they
go
saying
they
mean
to
kill
your
syndic
and
the
secretary
vanni
pizzuti
said
it
and
rocco
spatu
and
master
cinghialenta
vanni
pizzuti
has
taken
to
going
without
shoes
not
to
be
known
but
i
know
his
step
all
the
same
for
he
drags
his
feet
along
the
ground
and
raises
the
dust
like
a
flock
of
sheep
passing
what
is
it
to
you
cried
his
daughter
when
don
silvestro
was
gone
these
affairs
are
no
business
of
ours
the
inn
is
like
a
seaport
men
come
and
go
and
one
must
be
friendly
with
all
and
faithful
to
none
for
that
each
one
has
his
own
soul
for
himself
and
each
must
look
out
for
his
own
interests
and
not
make
rash
speeches
about
other
people
cousin
cinghialenta
and
rocco
spatu
spend
money
in
our
house
i
don
t
speak
of
pizzuti
who
sells
absinthe
and
tries
to
get
away
our
cousin
mosca
was
among
those
who
minded
their
own
business
and
passed
tranquilly
through
the
piazza
with
his
cart
amid
the
crowd
who
were
shaking
their
fists
in
the
air
don
t
you
care
whether
they
put
on
the
hide
tax
asked
mena
when
she
saw
him
come
back
with
his
poor
donkey
panting
and
with
drooped
ears
yes
of
course
i
care
but
to
pay
the
tax
the
cart
must
go
or
they
ll
take
away
the
ass
and
the
cart
as
they
say
they
re
going
to
kill
them
all
grandpapa
told
us
to
keep
the
door
shut
and
not
to
open
it
unless
they
come
back
will
you
go
out
tomorrow
too
i
must
go
and
take
a
load
of
lime
for
master
croce
oh
what
are
you
going
to
do
don
t
you
know
he
s
the
syndic
and
they
ll
kill
you
too
he
doesn
t
care
for
them
he
says
he
s
a
mason
and
he
has
to
strengthen
the
wall
of
don
filippo
s
vineyard
and
if
they
won
t
have
the
tax
on
pitch
don
silvestro
must
think
of
something
didn
t
i
tell
you
it
was
all
don
silvestro
s
fault
cried
mammy
venera
who
was
always
about
blowing
up
the
fires
of
discord
with
her
distaff
in
her
hand
it
s
all
the
affair
of
that
lot
who
have
nothing
to
lose
and
who
don
t
pay
a
tax
on
pitch
because
they
never
had
so
much
as
an
old
broken
board
at
sea
it
is
all
the
fault
of
don
silvestro
she
went
on
screeching
to
everybody
all
over
the
place
and
of
that
meddling
scamp
who
have
no
boat
either
of
them
and
live
on
their
neighbors
and
hold
out
the
hat
to
first
one
and
then
another
would
you
like
to
know
one
of
his
tricks
it
isn
t
a
bit
true
that
he
has
bought
the
debt
of
uncle
crucifix
it
s
all
a
lie
got
up
between
him
and
old
to
rob
those
poor
creatures
goosefoot
never
even
saw
five
hundred
don
silvestro
to
hear
what
they
said
of
him
went
often
to
the
tavern
to
buy
a
cigar
and
then
rocco
spatu
and
vanni
pizzuti
would
come
out
of
it
blaspheming
or
he
would
stop
on
the
way
home
from
his
vineyard
to
talk
with
uncle
santoro
and
heard
in
this
way
all
the
tale
of
the
fictitious
purchase
by
goosefoot
but
he
was
a
christian
with
a
stomach
as
deep
as
a
well
and
all
things
he
left
to
sink
into
it
he
knew
his
own
business
and
when
betta
met
him
with
his
mouth
open
worse
than
a
mad
dog
and
master
croce
calta
let
slip
his
usual
expression
that
it
didn
t
matter
to
him
he
replied
what
ll
you
bet
i
don
t
just
go
off
and
leave
you
and
went
no
more
to
the
syndic
s
house
but
on
the
sunday
appointed
for
the
meeting
of
the
council
don
silvestro
after
the
mass
went
and
planted
himself
in
the
where
there
had
formerly
been
the
post
of
the
national
guard
and
began
tranquilly
mending
his
pens
in
front
of
the
rough
pine
table
to
pass
away
the
time
while
la
zuppidda
and
the
other
gossips
vociferated
in
the
street
while
spinning
in
the
sun
swearing
that
they
would
tear
out
the
eyes
of
the
whole
lot
of
them
as
they
had
come
all
the
way
to
master
filippo
s
vineyard
to
call
him
couldn
t
do
less
than
move
so
he
put
on
his
new
overcoat
washed
his
hands
and
brushed
the
lime
off
his
clothes
but
wouldn
t
go
to
the
meeting
without
first
calling
for
don
stefano
to
come
to
him
it
was
in
vain
that
his
daughter
betta
took
him
by
the
shoulders
and
pushed
him
out
of
the
door
saying
to
him
that
they
who
had
cooked
the
broth
ought
to
eat
it
and
that
he
ought
to
let
the
others
do
as
they
liked
that
he
might
remain
syndic
this
time
master
calta
had
seen
the
crowd
before
the
distaffs
in
hand
and
he
planted
his
feet
on
the
ground
worse
than
a
mule
i
won
t
go
unless
don
silvestro
comes
he
repeated
with
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
don
silvestro
will
find
some
way
out
of
it
at
last
don
silvestro
came
with
a
face
like
a
wall
humming
an
air
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
eh
master
croce
don
t
lose
your
head
the
world
isn
t
going
to
come
to
an
end
this
time
master
croce
let
himself
be
led
away
by
don
silvestro
and
placed
before
the
pine
with
the
glass
inkstand
in
front
of
him
but
there
was
no
council
except
peppi
naso
the
butcher
all
greasy
and
who
feared
nobody
in
the
world
and
messer
tino
piedipassera
goosefoot
they
have
nothing
to
lose
screamed
la
zuppidda
from
the
door
and
they
come
here
to
suck
the
blood
of
the
poor
worse
than
so
many
leeches
because
they
live
upon
their
neighbors
and
hold
the
sack
for
this
one
and
that
one
to
commit
all
sorts
of
villanies
a
lot
of
thieves
and
see
if
i
don
t
slit
your
tongue
for
you
shouted
goosefoot
beginning
to
rise
from
behind
the
table
now
we
shall
come
to
grief
muttered
master
croce
giufà
i
say
i
say
what
sort
of
manners
are
these
you
re
not
in
the
piazza
called
out
don
silvestro
what
will
you
bet
i
don
t
kick
out
the
whole
of
you
now
i
shall
put
this
to
la
zuppidda
screamed
that
she
wouldn
t
have
it
put
to
rights
and
struggled
with
don
silvestro
who
pulled
her
by
the
hair
and
at
last
ended
by
thrusting
her
inside
her
own
gate
when
they
were
at
last
alone
he
began
what
is
it
you
want
what
is
it
to
you
if
we
put
a
tax
on
pitch
it
isn
t
you
or
your
husband
that
will
have
to
pay
it
but
those
who
come
to
have
their
boats
mended
listen
to
me
your
husband
is
an
ass
to
make
all
this
row
and
to
quarrel
with
the
now
when
there
is
another
councillor
to
be
chosen
in
the
room
of
padron
cipolla
or
master
mariano
who
are
of
no
use
and
your
husband
might
come
i
know
nothing
about
it
answered
la
zuppidda
becoming
quite
calm
in
an
instant
i
never
mix
myself
up
in
my
husband
s
affairs
i
know
he
s
biting
his
hands
with
rage
i
can
do
nothing
but
go
and
tell
him
if
the
thing
is
certain
of
course
it
is
certain
as
the
heavens
above
i
tell
you
are
we
honest
men
or
not
by
the
holy
big
devil
la
zuppidda
went
straight
off
to
her
husband
who
was
crouching
in
the
corner
of
the
court
carding
tow
pale
as
a
corpse
swearing
that
they
d
end
by
driving
him
to
do
something
mad
to
open
the
sanhedrim
and
try
if
the
fish
would
bite
there
were
still
wanting
padron
fortunato
cipolla
and
master
filippo
the
who
stayed
away
so
long
that
the
crowd
began
to
get
bored
so
much
so
that
the
gossips
began
to
spin
sitting
on
the
low
wall
of
the
yard
at
last
they
sent
word
that
they
couldn
t
come
they
had
too
much
to
do
the
tax
might
be
levied
just
as
well
without
them
word
for
word
what
my
daughter
betta
said
growled
master
croce
giufà
then
get
your
daughter
betta
to
help
you
exclaimed
don
silvestro
said
not
another
word
audibly
but
continued
to
mutter
between
his
teeth
now
said
don
silvestro
you
ll
see
that
the
zuppiddi
will
come
and
ask
me
to
take
their
daughter
barbara
but
they
ll
have
to
go
on
the
meeting
was
closed
without
deciding
upon
anything
the
clerk
wanted
time
to
get
up
his
subject
in
the
mean
while
the
clock
struck
twelve
and
the
gossips
quickly
disappeared
the
few
that
stayed
long
enough
to
see
master
cirino
shut
the
door
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
went
away
to
their
own
work
some
this
way
some
that
talking
as
they
went
of
the
dreadful
things
that
goosefoot
and
la
zuppidda
had
been
saying
in
the
evening
padron
ntoni
s
ntoni
heard
of
this
bad
language
and
sacrament
if
he
wouldn
t
show
goosefoot
that
he
had
been
for
a
soldier
he
met
him
just
as
he
was
coming
from
the
beach
near
the
house
of
the
zuppiddi
with
that
devil
s
of
his
and
began
to
speak
his
mind
to
him
that
he
was
a
old
carrion
and
that
he
had
better
take
care
what
he
said
of
the
zuppiddi
that
their
doings
was
no
affair
of
his
goosefoot
didn
t
keep
his
tongue
to
himself
either
holloa
do
you
think
you
ve
come
from
foreign
parts
to
play
the
master
here
i
ve
come
to
slit
your
weasand
for
you
if
you
don
t
hold
your
tongue
hearing
the
noise
a
crowd
of
people
came
to
the
doors
and
a
great
crowd
gathered
so
that
at
last
they
took
hold
of
each
other
and
goosefoot
who
was
sharp
as
the
devil
he
resembled
flung
himself
on
the
ground
all
in
a
heap
with
ntoni
malavoglia
who
thus
lost
all
the
advantage
which
his
good
legs
might
have
given
him
and
they
rolled
over
and
over
in
the
mud
beating
and
biting
each
other
as
if
they
had
been
peppi
naso
s
dogs
so
that
ntoni
had
to
be
pulled
into
the
zuppiddi
s
court
with
his
shirt
torn
off
his
back
and
was
led
home
bleeding
like
lazarus
you
ll
see
screamed
out
again
gossip
venera
after
she
had
slammed
the
door
in
the
faces
of
her
neighbors
you
ll
see
whether
i
mean
to
be
mistress
in
my
own
house
i
ll
give
my
girl
to
whomsoever
i
please
the
girl
ran
off
into
the
house
red
as
a
turkey
with
her
heart
beating
as
fast
as
a
spring
chicken
s
he
s
almost
pulled
off
your
ear
said
master
bastiano
as
he
poured
water
slowly
over
ntoni
s
head
bites
worse
than
a
dog
does
uncle
ntoni
s
eyes
were
still
full
of
blood
and
he
was
set
upon
vengeance
listen
madam
venera
he
said
in
the
hearing
of
all
the
world
if
your
daughter
doesn
t
take
me
i
ll
never
marry
and
the
girl
heard
him
in
her
chamber
this
is
no
time
to
speak
of
such
things
cousin
ntoni
but
if
your
grandfather
has
no
objection
i
wouldn
t
change
you
for
my
part
for
victor
emmanuel
master
zuppiddu
meanwhile
said
not
a
word
but
handed
ntoni
a
towel
to
dry
himself
with
so
that
ntoni
went
home
that
night
in
a
high
state
of
contentment
but
the
poor
malavoglia
when
they
heard
of
the
fight
with
goosefoot
trembled
to
think
how
they
might
at
any
moment
expect
the
officer
to
turn
them
for
goosefoot
lived
close
by
and
of
the
money
for
the
debt
they
had
only
after
endless
trouble
succeeded
in
putting
together
about
half
look
what
it
means
to
be
always
hanging
about
where
there
s
a
marriageable
girl
said
la
longa
to
ntoni
i
m
sorry
for
barbara
and
i
mean
to
marry
her
said
ntoni
to
marry
her
cried
the
grandfather
and
who
am
i
and
does
your
mother
count
for
nothing
when
your
father
married
her
that
sits
there
he
made
them
come
and
tell
me
first
your
grandmother
was
then
alive
and
they
came
and
spoke
to
us
in
the
garden
under
the
now
these
things
are
no
longer
the
custom
and
the
old
people
are
of
no
use
at
one
time
it
was
said
listen
to
the
old
and
you
ll
make
no
first
your
sister
mena
must
be
married
do
you
know
that
cursed
is
my
fate
cried
ntoni
stamping
and
tearing
his
hair
working
all
day
never
going
to
the
tavern
never
a
soldo
in
one
s
pocket
now
that
i
ve
found
a
girl
to
suit
me
i
can
t
have
her
why
did
i
come
back
from
the
army
listen
cried
old
ntoni
rising
slowly
and
painfully
in
consequence
of
the
racking
pain
in
his
back
go
to
bed
and
to
sleep
that
s
the
best
thing
for
you
to
do
you
should
never
speak
in
that
way
in
your
mother
s
my
brother
luca
that
s
gone
for
a
soldier
is
better
off
than
i
am
growled
ntoni
as
he
went
off
to
bed
viii
luca
poor
fellow
was
neither
better
off
nor
worse
he
did
his
duty
abroad
as
he
had
done
it
at
home
and
was
content
he
did
not
often
write
certainly
the
stamps
cost
twenty
centimes
each
nor
had
he
sent
his
portrait
because
from
his
boyhood
he
had
been
teased
about
his
great
ass
s
ears
instead
he
every
now
and
then
sent
a
note
which
he
made
out
to
earn
by
doing
odd
jobs
for
the
officers
the
grandfather
had
said
mena
must
be
married
it
was
not
yet
spoken
of
but
thought
of
always
and
now
that
the
money
was
accumulating
in
the
drawer
he
considered
that
the
anchovies
would
cover
the
debt
to
goosefoot
and
the
house
remain
free
for
the
dowry
of
the
girl
wherefore
he
was
seen
sometimes
talking
quietly
with
padron
fortunato
on
the
beach
while
waiting
for
the
bark
or
sitting
in
the
sun
on
the
church
steps
when
no
one
else
was
there
padron
fortunato
had
no
wish
to
go
back
from
his
word
if
the
girl
had
her
dowry
the
more
that
his
son
always
was
causing
him
anxiety
by
running
after
a
lot
of
penniless
girls
like
a
stupid
as
he
was
the
man
has
his
word
and
the
bull
has
his
horns
he
took
to
repeating
again
mena
had
often
a
heavy
heart
as
she
sat
at
the
loom
for
girls
have
quick
senses
and
now
that
her
grandfather
was
always
with
padron
fortunato
and
she
so
often
heard
the
name
cipolla
mentioned
in
the
house
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
the
same
sight
forever
before
her
as
if
that
blessed
christian
cousin
alfio
were
nailed
to
the
beams
of
the
loom
like
the
pictures
of
the
saints
one
evening
she
waited
until
it
was
quite
late
to
see
cousin
alfio
come
back
with
his
holding
her
hands
under
her
apron
for
it
was
cold
and
all
the
doors
were
shut
and
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
in
the
little
street
so
she
said
to
him
from
the
door
will
you
go
down
to
biccocca
at
the
first
of
the
month
she
asked
him
finally
not
yet
there
are
still
a
hundred
loads
of
wine
for
santuzza
afterwards
god
will
she
knew
not
what
to
say
while
cousin
alfio
came
and
went
in
the
little
court
unharnessing
the
donkey
and
hanging
the
harness
on
the
knobs
carrying
the
lantern
to
and
fro
if
you
go
to
biccocca
we
shall
not
see
each
other
any
more
said
mena
whose
voice
was
quite
faint
but
why
are
you
going
away
too
the
poor
child
could
not
speak
at
all
at
first
though
it
was
dark
and
no
one
could
see
her
face
from
time
to
time
the
neighbors
could
be
heard
speaking
behind
the
closed
doors
or
children
crying
or
the
noise
of
the
platters
in
some
house
where
supper
was
late
so
that
no
one
could
hear
them
talking
now
we
have
half
the
money
we
want
for
old
goosefoot
and
at
the
salting
of
the
anchovies
we
can
pay
the
other
alfio
at
this
left
the
donkey
in
the
court
and
came
out
into
the
street
then
you
will
be
married
after
easter
mena
did
not
reply
i
told
you
so
continued
alfio
i
saw
padron
ntoni
talking
with
padron
it
will
be
as
god
wills
said
mena
i
don
t
care
to
be
married
if
i
might
only
stay
on
what
a
fine
thing
it
is
for
cipolla
went
on
mosca
to
be
rich
enough
to
marry
whenever
he
pleases
and
take
the
wife
he
prefers
and
live
where
he
likes
cousin
alfio
said
mena
after
stopping
a
while
to
gaze
at
the
lantern
hanging
on
the
wicket
and
the
donkey
cropping
the
nettles
on
the
wall
cousin
alfio
also
said
and
went
back
to
put
the
donkey
in
his
stall
among
those
who
were
looking
after
barbara
was
vanni
pizzuti
when
he
used
to
go
to
the
house
to
shave
master
bastiano
who
had
the
sciatica
and
also
don
michele
who
found
it
a
bore
to
do
nothing
but
march
around
with
the
pistols
in
his
belt
when
he
wasn
t
behind
santuzza
s
counter
and
went
ogling
the
pretty
girls
to
pass
away
the
time
barbara
at
first
returned
his
glances
but
afterwards
when
her
mother
told
her
that
those
fellows
were
only
loafing
around
to
no
purpose
a
lot
of
spies
all
foreigners
were
only
fit
to
be
flogged
she
slammed
the
window
in
his
face
mustache
cap
and
all
and
don
michele
was
furious
and
for
spite
took
to
walking
up
and
down
the
street
twisting
his
mustache
with
his
cap
over
his
ear
on
sunday
however
he
put
on
his
plumed
hat
and
went
into
vanni
pizzuti
s
shop
to
make
eyes
at
her
as
she
went
by
to
mass
with
her
mother
don
silvestro
also
took
to
going
to
be
shaved
among
those
who
waited
for
the
mass
and
to
warming
himself
at
the
brazier
for
the
hot
water
exchanging
saucy
speeches
with
the
rest
that
barbara
begins
to
hang
on
ntoni
malavoglia
s
hands
he
said
what
will
you
bet
he
doesn
t
marry
her
after
all
there
he
stands
waiting
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
waiting
for
her
to
come
to
at
last
one
day
don
michele
said
if
it
were
not
for
the
cap
with
the
border
i
d
make
that
ugly
scamp
ntoni
malavoglia
hold
the
candle
for
me
that
i
don
silvestro
lost
no
time
in
telling
ntoni
everything
and
how
don
michele
the
brigadier
who
was
not
the
man
to
let
the
flies
perch
on
his
nose
had
a
grudge
against
him
goosefoot
when
he
went
to
be
shaved
and
heard
that
don
michele
would
have
given
him
something
to
get
rid
of
ntoni
malavoglia
ruffled
himself
up
like
a
because
he
was
so
much
thought
of
in
the
place
vanni
pizzuti
went
on
saying
don
michele
would
give
anything
to
have
the
malavoglia
in
his
hands
as
you
have
oh
why
did
you
let
that
row
with
ntoni
pass
off
so
easily
goosefoot
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
went
on
warming
his
hands
over
the
brazier
don
silvestro
began
to
laugh
and
answered
for
him
master
vanni
would
like
to
pull
the
chestnuts
out
of
the
fire
with
goosefoot
s
paws
we
know
already
that
gossip
venera
will
have
nothing
to
say
to
foreigners
or
to
caps
so
if
ntoni
malavoglia
were
out
of
the
way
he
would
be
the
only
one
left
for
the
vanni
pizzuti
said
nothing
but
he
lay
awake
the
whole
night
thinking
of
it
it
wouldn
t
be
such
a
bad
thing
he
thought
to
himself
everything
depends
upon
getting
hold
of
goosefoot
some
day
when
he
is
in
the
right
sort
of
it
came
that
day
once
when
rocco
spatu
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
goosefoot
had
come
in
two
or
three
times
rather
late
to
look
for
him
with
a
pale
face
and
starting
eyes
too
and
the
customs
guard
had
been
seen
rushing
here
and
there
full
of
business
smelling
about
like
with
noses
to
the
ground
and
don
michele
along
with
them
with
pistols
in
belt
and
trousers
thrust
into
his
boots
you
might
do
a
good
service
to
don
michele
if
you
would
take
ntoni
malavoglia
out
of
his
way
said
vanni
to
papa
tino
as
he
stood
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
shop
buying
a
cigar
you
d
do
him
a
famous
service
and
make
a
friend
of
him
for
i
dare
say
sighed
goosefoot
he
had
no
breath
that
evening
and
said
nothing
more
in
the
night
were
heard
shots
over
towards
the
cliffs
called
the
rotolo
and
along
all
the
beach
as
if
some
one
were
hunting
quail
quail
indeed
murmured
the
as
they
started
up
in
bed
to
listen
quail
those
are
quail
that
bring
sugar
and
coffee
and
silk
handkerchiefs
that
pay
no
duty
that
s
why
don
michele
had
his
boots
in
his
trousers
and
his
pistols
in
his
goosefoot
went
as
usual
to
the
barber
s
shop
for
his
morning
glass
before
the
lantern
over
the
door
had
been
put
out
but
that
next
morning
he
had
the
face
of
a
dog
that
has
upset
the
kettle
he
made
none
of
his
usual
jokes
and
asked
this
one
and
that
one
why
there
had
been
such
a
devil
of
a
row
in
the
night
and
what
had
become
of
rocco
spatu
and
cinghialenta
and
doffed
his
cap
to
don
michele
and
insisted
on
paying
for
his
morning
draught
goosefoot
said
to
him
take
a
glass
of
spirits
don
michele
it
will
do
your
stomach
good
after
your
wakeful
night
blood
of
judas
exclaimed
goosefoot
striking
his
fist
on
the
counter
and
feigning
to
fly
into
a
real
rage
it
isn
t
to
rome
that
i
ll
send
that
young
ruffian
ntoni
to
do
bravo
assented
vanni
i
wouldn
t
have
passed
it
over
i
assure
you
nor
you
don
michele
i
ll
don
michele
approved
with
a
growl
i
ll
take
care
that
ntoni
and
all
his
relations
are
put
in
their
places
goosefoot
went
on
threatening
i
m
not
going
to
have
the
whole
place
laughing
at
me
you
may
rest
assured
of
that
much
don
and
off
he
went
limping
and
blaspheming
as
if
he
were
in
a
fearful
rage
while
all
the
time
he
was
saying
to
himself
one
must
keep
friends
with
all
these
spies
and
ruminating
on
how
he
was
to
make
a
friend
of
santuzza
as
well
going
to
the
inn
where
he
heard
from
uncle
santoro
that
neither
rocco
spatu
nor
had
been
there
then
went
on
to
cousin
anna
s
who
poor
thing
hadn
t
slept
a
wink
and
stood
at
her
door
looking
out
pale
as
a
ghost
there
he
met
the
wasp
who
had
come
to
see
if
cousin
anna
had
by
chance
a
little
leaven
today
i
must
speak
with
your
uncle
dumbbell
about
the
affair
you
know
of
said
goosefoot
was
willing
enough
to
speak
of
that
affair
which
never
came
to
an
end
and
when
things
grow
too
long
they
turn
into
padron
ntoni
was
always
preaching
that
the
malavoglia
were
honest
people
and
that
he
would
pay
him
but
he
would
like
to
know
where
the
money
was
to
come
from
in
the
place
everybody
knew
to
a
centime
what
everybody
owned
and
those
honest
people
the
malavoglia
even
if
they
sold
their
souls
to
the
turks
couldn
t
manage
to
pay
even
so
much
as
the
half
by
easter
and
to
get
possession
of
the
house
one
must
have
stamped
paper
and
all
sorts
of
expenses
that
he
knew
very
well
and
all
this
time
padron
ntoni
was
talking
of
marrying
his
granddaughter
he
d
seen
him
with
padron
cipolla
and
uncle
santoro

seen
him
too
and
he
too
went
on

always
at
his
heels

to
the
last
centime
and
i
won
t
listen
to
anybody
for
the
least
in
fact
easter
was
drawing
near
the
hills
began
once
more
to
clothe
themselves
with
green
and
the
indian
figs
were
in
flower
the
girls
had
sowed
basil
outside
the
windows
and
the
white
butterflies
came
to
flutter
about
it
even
the
pale
plants
on
the
were
starred
with
white
flowers
in
the
morning
the
red
and
yellow
tiles
smoked
in
the
rising
sun
and
the
sparrows
twittered
there
until
the
sun
had
set
and
the
house
by
the
too
had
a
sort
of
festive
air
the
court
was
swept
the
nets
and
cords
were
hung
neatly
against
the
wall
or
spread
on
the
garden
was
full
of
cabbages
and
lettuce
and
the
rooms
were
open
and
full
of
sunshine
that
looked
as
if
it
too
were
content
all
things
proclaimed
that
easter
was
at
hand
the
elders
sat
on
the
steps
in
the
evening
and
the
girls
sang
at
the
the
wagons
began
again
to
pass
the
by
night
and
at
dusk
there
began
once
more
the
sound
of
voices
in
conversation
in
the
little
street
cousin
mena
is
going
to
be
married
they
said
her
mother
is
busy
with
her
outfit
time
had
passed
and
all
things
pass
away
with
time
sad
things
as
well
as
sweet
now
cousin
maruzza
was
always
busy
cutting
and
sewing
all
sorts
of
household
furnishing
and
mena
never
asked
for
whom
they
were
intended
and
one
evening
brasi
cipolla
was
brought
into
the
house
with
master
fortunato
his
father
and
all
his
relations
here
is
cousin
cipolla
who
is
come
to
make
you
a
visit
said
padron
ntoni
introducing
him
into
the
house
as
if
no
one
knew
anything
about
it
beforehand
while
all
the
time
wine
and
roasted
pease
were
made
ready
in
the
kitchen
and
the
women
and
the
girls
had
on
their
best
clothes
that
evening
mena
looked
exactly
like
sant
with
her
new
dress
and
her
black
kerchief
on
her
head
so
that
brasi
never
took
his
eyes
off
her
but
sat
staring
at
her
all
the
evening
like
a
basilisk
sitting
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
with
his
hands
between
his
knees
rubbing
them
now
and
then
on
the
sly
for
very
pleasure
he
is
come
with
his
son
brasi
who
is
quite
a
big
fellow
now
continued
padron
ntoni
yes
the
children
grow
and
shoulder
us
into
the
ground
answered
padron
fortunato
now
you
ll
take
a
glass
of
our
wine
of
the
best
we
have
and
a
few
dried
pease
which
my
daughter
has
toasted
if
we
had
only
known
you
were
coming
we
might
have
had
something
ready
better
worth
your
we
happened
to
be
passing
by
said
padron
cipolla
and
we
said
let
s
go
and
make
a
visit
to
cousin
brasi
filled
his
pockets
with
dried
pease
always
looking
at
the
girl
and
then
the
boys
cleared
the
dish
in
spite
of
all
nunziata
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
could
do
to
hinder
them
talking
all
the
while
among
themselves
softly
as
if
they
had
been
in
church
the
elders
by
this
time
were
in
conversation
together
under
the
medlar
all
the
gossips
clustering
around
full
of
praises
of
the
girl
how
she
was
such
a
good
manager
and
kept
the
house
neat
as
a
new
pin
the
girl
as
she
is
trained
and
the
flax
as
it
is
spun
they
quoted
your
granddaughter
is
also
grown
up
said
padron
fortunato
it
is
time
she
was
if
the
lord
sends
her
a
good
husband
i
ask
nothing
better
replied
padron
ntoni
the
husband
and
the
bishop
are
chosen
by
heaven
added
cousin
la
longa
mena
sat
by
the
young
man
as
is
the
custom
but
she
never
lifted
her
eyes
from
her
apron
and
brasi
complained
to
his
father
when
they
came
away
that
she
had
not
offered
him
the
plate
with
the
dried
pease
did
you
want
more
interrupted
padron
fortunate
when
they
were
out
of
hearing
nobody
could
hear
anything
for
your
munching
like
a
mule
at
a
sack
of
barley
look
if
you
haven
t
upset
the
wine
on
your
new
trousers
lout
you
ve
spoiled
a
new
suit
for
padron
ntoni
in
high
spirits
rubbing
his
hands
said
to
his
i
can
hardly
believe
that
everything
is
so
happily
settled
mena
will
want
for
nothing
and
now
we
can
put
in
order
all
our
other
little
matters
and
you
may
say
the
old
daddy
was
right
when
he
said
tears
and
smiles
come
close
that
saturday
towards
evening
nunziata
came
in
to
get
a
handful
of
beans
for
the
children
and
said
cousin
alfio
goes
away
he
s
packing
up
all
his
mena
turned
white
and
stopped
weaving
in
alfio
s
house
there
was
a
light
everything
was
he
came
a
few
minutes
after
knocking
at
the
door
also
with
a
very
white
face
and
tying
and
untying
the
knot
of
the
lash
of
his
whip
which
he
held
in
his
hand
i
ve
come
to
say
to
you
all
cousin
maruzza
padron
ntoni
the
boys
and
you
too
cousin
mena
the
wine
from
aci
catena

now
santuzza

it
from
master
filippo
i
m
going
to
biccocca
where
there
is
work
to
be
got
for
my
mena
said
nothing
only
the
mother
spoke
in
reply
to
him
won
t
you
wait
for
padron
ntoni
he
will
be
glad
to
see
you
before
you
so
cousin
alfio
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
whip
in
hand
and
looked
about
the
room
in
the
opposite
direction
to
that
where
mena
was
now
when
are
you
coming
back
said
la
longa
who
knows
when
i
shall
come
back
i
shall
go
where
my
donkey
carries
me
as
long
as
there
is
work
i
shall
stay
but
i
should
rather
come
back
here
if
i
could
manage
to
live
take
care
of
your
health
cousin
alfio
i
ve
been
told
that
people
die
like
flies
of
the
malaria
down
there
at
the
alfio
shrugged
his
shoulders
saying
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
i
would
much
rather
not
have
gone
away
from
he
went
on
looking
at
the
candle
and
you
say
nothing
to
me
cousin
mena
the
girl
opened
her
mouth
two
or
three
times
as
if
to
speak
but
no
words
came
her
heart
beat
too
fast
and
you
too
will
leave
the
neighborhood
when
you
are
married
added
alfio
the
world
is
like
an
inn
with
people
coming
and
going
everybody
will
have
changed
places
and
nothing
will
be
the
same
as
it
so
saying
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
smiled
but
with
lips
only
not
in
his
heart
girls
said
la
longa
go
where
heaven
appoints
them
to
go
when
they
are
young
they
are
gay
and
have
no
care
when
they
go
into
the
world
they
meet
with
grief
and
alfio
after
padron
ntoni
and
the
boys
had
come
back
and
he
had
wished
them
also
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
go
but
stood
on
the
threshold
with
his
whip
under
his
arm
shaking
hands
now
with
one
now
with
another
with
cousin
maruzza
as
well
as
the
rest
and
went
on
repeating
as
people
do
when
they
are
going
for
a
long
journey
and
are
not
sure
of
ever
coming
back
pardon
me
if
i
have
been
wanting
in
any
way
towards
any
of
the
only
one
who
did
not
take
his
hand
was
sant
agata
who
stayed
in
the
dark
corner
by
the
loom
but
of
course
that
is
the
proper
way
for
girls
to
behave
on
such
occasions
it
was
a
fine
spring
evening
and
the
moon
shone
over
the
court
and
the
street
over
the
people
sitting
before
the
doors
and
the
girls
walking
up
and
down
singing
with
their
arms
around
each
other
s
waists
mena
came
out
too
with
nunziata
she
felt
as
if
she
should
suffocate
in
the
house
now
we
sha
n
t
see
cousin
alfio
s
lamp
any
more
in
the
evenings
said
nunziata
and
the
house
will
be
shut
cousin
alfio
had
loaded
his
cart
with
all
the
wares
he
was
taking
away
with
him
and
now
he
was
tying
up
the
straw
which
remained
in
the
manger
into
a
bundle
while
the
pot
bubbled
on
the
fire
with
the
beans
for
his
supper
shall
you
be
gone
before
morning
cousin
alfio
asked
nunziata
from
the
door
of
the
little
court
yes
i
have
a
long
way
to
go
and
this
poor
beast
has
a
heavy
load
i
must
let
him
have
a
rest
in
the
mena
said
nothing
but
leaned
on
the
looking
at
the
loaded
cart
the
empty
house
the
bed
half
taken
down
and
the
pot
boiling
for
the
last
time
on
the
hearth
are
you
there
too
cousin
mena
cried
alfio
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
and
left
off
what
he
was
engaged
upon
she
nodded
her
head
and
nunziata
ran
like
a
good
as
she
was
to
skim
off
the
pot
which
was
boiling
over
i
am
glad
you
are
here
now
i
can
say
goodbye
to
you
i
came
here
to
see
you
once
more
she
said
with
tears
in
her
voice
why
do
you
go
down
there
where
there
is
the
malaria
alfio
began
to
laugh
from
the
lips
outward
as
he
did
when
he
went
to
say
to
them
all
a
pretty
question
why
do
i
go
there
and
why
do
you
marry
brasi
cipolla
one
does
what
one
can
cousin
mena
if
i
could
have
done
as
i
wished
to
do
you
know
what
i
would
have
she
gazed
and
gazed
at
him
with
eyes
shining
with
tears
i
should
have
stayed
here
where
the
very
walls
are
my
friends
and
where
i
can
go
about
in
the
night
to
stable
my
donkey
even
in
the
dark
and
i
should
have
married
you
cousin
mena
i
have
held
you
in
my
heart
this
long
while
and
i
shall
carry
you
with
me
to
the
biccocca
and
wherever
i
may
go
but
this
is
all
useless
talk
and
one
must
do
what
one
can
my
donkey
too
must
go
where
i
drive
now
farewell
said
mena
at
last
i
too
have
something
like
a
thorn
here
within
me
and
now
when
i
see
this
window
always
shut
it
will
seem
as
if
my
heart
were
shut
too
as
if
it
were
shut
inside
the
window
heavy
as
an
oaken
door
but
so
god
wills
now
i
wish
you
well
and
i
must
the
poor
child
wept
silently
hiding
her
eyes
with
her
hand
and
went
away
with
nunziata
to
sit
and
cry
under
the
in
the
moonlight
ix
the
malavoglia
nor
any
one
else
in
the
town
had
any
idea
what
goosefoot
and
uncle
crucifix
were
hatching
together
on
easter
day
ntoni
took
out
the
hundred
lire
which
were
amassed
in
the
bureau
drawer
and
put
on
his
sunday
jacket
to
carry
them
to
uncle
crucifix
what
is
it
all
here
said
he
it
can
t
yet
be
all
uncle
crucifix
you
know
how
much
it
costs
us
to
get
together
a
hundred
lire
but
better
half
a
loaf
than
no
bread
and
paying
on
account
is
no
bad
now
the
summer
is
coming
and
with
god
s
help
we
ll
pay
off
the
why
do
you
bring
it
to
me
you
know
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
it
it
is
cousin
goosefoot
s
it
is
all
the
same
it
seems
always
to
me
as
if
i
owed
it
to
you
whenever
i
see
you
cousin
tino
won
t
say
no
if
you
ask
him
to
wait
until
the
madonna
del
this
won
t
even
pay
the
expenses
said
old
passing
the
money
through
his
fingers
go
to
him
yourself
and
ask
him
if
he
ll
wait
for
you
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
goosefoot
began
to
swear
and
to
fling
his
cap
on
the
ground
after
his
usual
fashion
vowing
that
he
had
not
bread
to
eat
and
that
he
could
not
wait
even
until
listen
cousin
tino
said
padron
ntoni
with
clasped
hands
as
if
he
were
praying
to
our
lord
god
if
you
don
t
give
me
at
least
until
saint
giovanni
now
that
i
have
to
marry
my
granddaughter
it
would
be
better
that
you
should
stab
me
with
a
knife
and
be
done
with
by
the
holy
devil
cried
uncle
tino
you
make
me
do
more
than
i
can
manage
cursed
be
the
day
and
the
hour
in
which
i
mixed
myself
up
in
this
confounded
and
he
went
off
tearing
at
his
old
cap
padron
ntoni
went
home
still
pale
from
the
encounter
and
said
to
his
i
ve
got
off
this
time
but
i
had
to
beg
him
as
if
i
had
been
praying
to
god
and
the
poor
old
fellow
still
trembled
but
he
was
glad
that
nothing
had
come
to
padron
cipolla
s
ears
and
that
the
marriage
was
not
likely
to
be
broken
off
on
the
evening
of
the
ascension
while
the
boys
were
still
dancing
around
the
post
with
the
bonfire
the
gossips
were
collected
around
the
malavoglia
s
balcony
and
cousin
venera
zuppidda
was
with
them
to
listen
to
what
was
said
and
to
give
her
opinion
like
the
rest
now
as
padron
ntoni
was
marrying
his
granddaughter
and
the
was
on
her
legs
once
more
everybody
was
ready
to
put
a
good
face
on
it
with
the
malavoglia
for
nobody
knew
anything
of
what
goosefoot
had
in
his
head
to
do
not
even
cousin
grace
his
wife
who
went
on
talking
with
cousin
maruzza
just
as
if
her
husband
had
nothing
on
his
mind
ntoni
went
every
evening
to
have
a
chat
with
barbara
and
had
confided
to
her
that
his
grandfather
had
said
first
we
must
marry
and
i
come
next
concluded
ntoni
after
this
barbara
had
given
to
mena
the
pot
of
basil
all
adorned
with
carnations
and
tied
up
with
a
fine
red
ribbon
which
was
the
sign
of
particular
friendship
between
girls
and
everybody
made
a
great
deal
of
sant
agata
even
her
mother
had
taken
off
her
black
kerchief
because
it
is
unlucky
to
wear
mourning
in
the
house
where
there
is
a
bride
and
had
written
to
luca
to
give
him
notice
that
mena
was
going
to
be
married
she
alone
poor
girl
seemed
anything
but
gay
and
everything
looked
black
to
her
though
the
fields
were
covered
with
stars
of
silver
and
of
gold
and
the
girls
wove
garlands
for
ascension
and
she
herself
went
up
and
down
the
stairs
helping
her
mother
to
hang
the
garlands
over
the
door
and
the
windows
while
all
the
doors
were
hung
with
flowers
only
that
of
cousin
alfio
black
and
twisted
awry
was
always
shut
and
no
one
came
to
hang
the
flowers
there
for
the
ascension
that
coquette
sant
agata
vespa
went
about
saying
in
her
furious
way
she
s
managed
at
last
to
send
that
poor
alfio
mosca
out
of
the
meanwhile
they
had
made
a
new
gown
for
sant
and
were
only
waiting
until
saint
john
s
day
to
take
the
silver
dagger
out
of
her
braids
of
hair
and
part
it
over
her
forehead
before
she
went
to
church
so
that
every
one
who
saw
her
pass
said
lucky
girl
padron
cipolla
at
this
time
sat
for
whole
evenings
together
with
padron
ntoni
on
the
church
steps
talking
of
the
wondrous
doings
of
the
brasi
was
always
hanging
about
the
street
near
the
malavoglia
with
his
new
clothes
on
and
soon
after
it
was
known
all
over
the
place
that
on
that
sunday
coming
cousin
grace
goosefoot
was
going
herself
to
part
the
girl
s
hair
and
to
take
out
the
silver
dagger
from
her
braids
because
brasi
cipolla
had
lost
his
mother
and
the
malavoglia
had
asked
cousin
grace
on
purpose
to
please
her
husband
and
they
had
asked
also
uncle
crucifix
and
all
the
neighborhood
and
all
their
relations
and
friends
without
exception
cousin
venera
la
zuppidda
made
no
end
of
a
row
because
she
hadn
t
been
asked
to
dress
the
bride
s
hair
she
who
was
going
to
be
a
connection
of
the
malavoglia
and
her
girl
had
a
friendship
with
mena
so
much
so
that
she
had
made
up
a
new
jacket
for
barbara
in
a
hurry
not
expecting
such
an
affront
ntoni
prayed
and
begged
in
vain
that
they
would
not
take
it
up
like
that
but
pass
it
over
cousin
venera
with
her
hair
ready
dressed
but
with
her
hands
covered
with
flour
for
she
had
begun
to
make
the
bread
so
that
she
didn
t
mean
to
go
to
the
party
at
the
malavoglia
replied
you
wanted
goosefoot
s
wife
keep
her
or
her
or
me
we
can
t
stay
together
the
malavoglia
know
very
well
that
they
have
chosen
madam
grace
only
because
of
the
money
they
owe
her
husband
now
they
are
hand
and
glove
with
old
tino
since
padron
cipolla
made
him
make
it
up
with
padron
ntoni
s
ntoni
after
that
affair
of
the
fight
they
would
lick
his
boots
because
they
owe
him
that
money
on
the
house
she
went
on
scolding
they
owe
my
husband
fifty
lire
too
for
the
i
mean
to
make
them
pay
do
let
them
alone
mother
supplicated
barbara
but
she
was
in
the
pouts
too
because
she
couldn
t
wear
her
new
jacket
and
she
was
almost
sorry
she
had
spent
the
money
for
the
for
mena
and
ntoni
who
had
come
to
take
her
home
with
him
had
to
go
off
alone
quite
chapfallen
looking
as
if
his
new
coat
were
too
big
for
him
mother
and
daughter
stood
looking
out
of
the
court
where
they
were
putting
the
bread
in
the
oven
listening
to
the
noise
going
on
at
the
house
by
the
medlar
for
the
talking
and
laughing
could
be
heard
quite
plainly
where
they
were
putting
them
in
a
greater
rage
than
ever
the
house
was
full
of
people
just
as
it
had
been
at
the
time
of
bastianazzo
s
death
and
mena
without
her
dagger
and
with
her
hair
parted
in
the
middle
looked
quite
differently
so
that
the
gossips
all
crowded
around
her
and
made
such
a
chattering
that
you
couldn
t
have
heard
a
cannonade
goosefoot
went
on
talking
nonsense
to
the
women
and
made
them
laugh
as
if
he
had
been
tickling
them
while
all
the
time
the
lawyer
was
getting
ready
the
papers
although
uncle
crucifix
had
said
that
there
was
time
enough
yet
to
send
the
summons
even
padron
cipolla
permitted
himself
a
joke
or
two
at
which
no
one
laughed
but
his
son
brasi
and
everybody
spoke
at
once
while
the
boys
struggled
on
the
floor
for
beans
and
chestnuts
even
la
longa
poor
woman
had
forgotten
her
troubles
for
the
moment
so
pleased
was
she
and
padron
ntoni
sat
on
the
low
wall
nodding
his
head
in
assent
to
everybody
and
smiling
to
himself
take
care
that
this
time
you
don
t
give
your
drink
to
your
trousers
which
are
not
thirsty
said
padron
cipolla
to
his
son
the
party
is
given
for
cousin
mena
said
nunziata
but
she
doesn
t
seem
to
enjoy
it
as
the
others
at
which
cousin
anna
made
as
if
she
had
dropped
the
flask
which
she
had
in
her
hand
in
which
there
was
still
nearly
a
of
wine
and
called
out
here
s
luck
here
s
luck
where
there
are
shards
there
is
feasting
and
spilled
wine
is
of
good
a
little
more
and
i
should
have
had
it
on
my
new
trousers
this
time
too
growled
brasi
who
since
his
misfortune
to
his
new
clothes
had
become
very
cautious
goosefoot
sat
astride
of
the
wall
with
the
glass
between
his
legs
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
were
already
the
master
because
of
that
summons
he
meant
to
send
and
called
out
there
s
nobody
at
the
tavern
not
even
rocco
spatu
today
all
the
fun
s
here
the
same
as
if
we
were
at
santuzza
from
the
wall
where
he
sat
goosefoot
could
see
a
group
of
people
who
stood
talking
together
by
the
fountain
with
faces
as
serious
as
if
the
world
were
coming
to
an
end
at
the
druggist
s
shop
there
were
the
usual
idlers
with
the
journal
talking
and
shaking
their
fists
in
each
other
s
faces
as
if
they
were
coming
to
blows
the
next
minute
while
don
giammaria
laughed
and
took
snuff
with
a
satisfaction
visible
even
at
that
distance
why
didn
t
don
silvestro
and
the
vicar
come
asked
goosefoot
i
told
them
to
but
they
appear
to
have
something
particular
to
do
answered
padron
ntoni
they
re
over
there
at
the
shop
and
there
s
a
fuss
as
if
the
man
with
the
numbers
of
the
lottery
had
come
what
the
deuce
can
have
happened
an
old
woman
rushed
across
the
piazza
screaming
and
tearing
her
hair
as
if
at
some
dreadful
news
and
before
pizzuti
s
shop
there
was
a
crowd
as
thick
as
if
an
ass
had
tumbled
under
his
load
there
and
even
the
children
stood
outside
listening
not
daring
to
go
nearer
for
my
part
i
shall
go
and
see
what
it
is
said
goosefoot
coming
slowly
down
off
the
wall
in
the
group
instead
of
a
fallen
ass
there
were
two
soldiers
of
the
marine
corps
with
sacks
on
their
shoulders
and
their
heads
bound
up
going
home
on
leave
who
had
stopped
on
their
way
at
the
barber
s
to
get
a
glass
of
bitters
they
were
telling
how
there
had
been
a
great
battle
at
sea
and
how
ships
as
big
as
all
aci
trezza
full
as
they
could
hold
of
soldiers
had
gone
down
just
as
they
were
so
that
their
tales
sounded
like
those
of
the
men
who
go
about
recounting
the
adventures
of
orlando
and
the
paladins
of
france
on
the
marina
at
catania
and
the
people
stood
as
thick
as
flies
in
the
sun
to
listen
to
them
maruzza
la
longa
s
son
was
also
on
board
the
d
observed
don
silvestro
who
had
also
drawn
near
to
listen
with
the
rest
now
i
ll
go
and
tell
that
to
my
wife
cried
master
cola
zuppiddu
then
she
ll
be
sure
to
go
to
cousin
maruzza
i
don
t
like
coolnesses
between
friends
and
but
meanwhile
the
poor
longa
knew
nothing
about
it
and
was
laughing
and
amusing
herself
among
her
relations
and
friends
the
soldier
seemed
never
tired
of
talking
and
gesticulated
with
his
arms
like
a
preacher
yes
there
were
sicilians
there
were
men
from
every
place
you
can
think
of
but
mind
you
when
the
calls
pipe
to
the
batteries
one
minds
neither
north
nor
south
and
the
guns
all
talk
the
same
language
brave
fellows
all
and
with
strong
hearts
under
their
shirts
i
can
tell
you
when
one
has
seen
what
i
have
seen
with
these
eyes
how
those
boys
stood
up
to
their
duty
by
our
lady
one
feels
that
one
has
a
right
to
cock
one
s
the
youth
s
eyes
were
wet
but
he
said
it
was
only
because
the
bitters
were
so
strong
it
seems
to
me
those
fellows
are
all
mad
said
padron
cipolla
blowing
his
nose
with
great
deliberation
would
you
go
and
get
yourself
killed
just
because
the
king
said
to
you
go
and
be
killed
for
my
sake
all
the
evening
there
was
talking
and
laughing
and
drinking
in
the
malavoglia
s
court
in
the
bright
moonlight
and
when
nearly
everybody
was
tired
and
they
sat
chewing
roasted
beans
with
their
backs
against
the
wall
some
of
them
singing
softly
among
themselves
they
began
talking
about
the
story
that
the
two
soldiers
on
leave
had
been
telling
padron
fortunato
had
gone
away
early
taking
with
him
his
son
in
his
new
clothes
those
poor
malavoglia
said
he
meeting
in
the
piazza
god
have
mercy
on
them
it
seems
as
if
they
were
bewitched
they
have
nothing
but
ill
uncle
crucifix
scratched
his
head
in
silence
it
was
no
affair
of
his
any
more
goosefoot
had
taken
charge
of
it
but
he
was
sorry
for
them
really
he
was
in
earnest
the
day
after
the
rumor
began
to
spread
that
there
had
been
a
great
battle
at
sea
over
towards
trieste
between
our
ships
and
those
of
the
enemy
nobody
knew
how
many
there
were
and
many
people
had
been
killed
some
told
the
story
in
one
way
some
in
another
in
pieces
as
it
were
and
broken
phrases
the
neighbors
came
with
hands
under
their
aprons
to
ask
cousin
maruzza
whether
that
were
not
where
luca
was
and
looked
sadly
at
her
as
they
did
so
the
poor
woman
began
to
stand
at
the
door
as
they
do
when
a
misfortune
happens
turning
her
head
this
way
and
that
or
looking
down
the
road
towards
the
turn
as
if
she
expected
her
and
the
boys
back
from
the
sea
before
the
usual
time
then
the
neighbors
would
ask
her
if
she
had
had
a
letter
from
luca
lately
or
how
long
it
had
been
since
he
had
written
in
truth
she
had
not
thought
about
the
letter
but
now
she
could
not
sleep
nor
close
her
eyes
the
whole
night
thinking
always
of
the
sea
over
towards
trieste
where
that
dreadful
thing
had
happened
and
she
saw
her
son
always
before
her
pale
immovable
with
sad
shining
eyes
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
nodded
his
head
at
her
as
he
had
done
when
he
left
her
to
go
for
a
soldier
and
thinking
of
him
she
felt
as
if
she
had
a
burning
thirst
herself
and
a
burning
heat
inside
that
was
past
description
among
all
the
stories
that
were
always
going
in
the
village
she
remembered
one
of
some
sailors
that
had
been
picked
up
after
many
hours
just
in
time
to
save
them
from
being
devoured
by
the
sharks
and
how
in
the
midst
of
all
that
water
they
were
dying
of
thirst
and
as
she
thought
of
how
they
were
dying
of
thirst
in
the
midst
of
all
that
water
she
could
not
help
getting
up
to
drink
out
of
the
pitcher
and
lay
in
the
dark
with
eyes
seeing
always
that
mournful
vision
as
days
went
on
however
there
was
no
more
talk
of
what
had
happened
but
as
la
longa
had
no
letter
she
began
to
be
unable
either
to
work
or
to
stay
still
and
she
was
always
wandering
from
house
to
house
as
if
so
she
hoped
to
hear
of
something
to
ease
her
mind
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
like
a
cat
who
has
lost
her
kitten
asked
the
neighbors
of
each
other
and
padron
ntoni
did
not
go
to
sea
and
followed
his
about
as
if
he
had
been
a
dog
some
one
said
to
him
go
to
catania
that
is
a
big
place
they
ll
be
able
to
tell
you
something
in
that
big
place
the
poor
old
man
felt
more
lost
than
he
ever
did
out
at
sea
by
night
when
he
didn
t
know
which
way
to
point
his
rudder
at
last
some
one
was
charitable
enough
to
tell
him
to
go
to
the
captain
of
the
port
who
would
be
certain
to
know
all
about
it
there
after
sending
them
from
pilate
to
herod
and
back
again
he
began
to
turn
over
certain
big
books
and
run
down
the
lists
of
the
dead
with
his
finger
when
he
came
to
one
name
la
longa
who
had
scarcely
heard
what
went
on
so
loudly
did
her
ears
ring
and
was
listening
as
white
as
the
sheet
of
paper
slipped
silently
down
on
the
floor
as
if
she
had
been
dead
it
was
more
than
forty
days
ago
said
the
clerk
shutting
up
the
list
it
was
at
lissa
had
not
you
heard
of
it
yet
they
brought
la
longa
home
in
a
cart
and
she
was
ill
for
several
days
henceforward
she
was
given
to
a
great
devotion
to
the
mother
of
sorrows
who
is
on
the
altar
of
the
little
chapel
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
the
long
corpse
stretched
on
the
mother
s
knees
with
blue
ribs
and
bleeding
side
was
her
luca
s
own
portrait
and
in
her
own
heart
she
felt
the
points
of
the
madonna
s
seven
sharp
swords
every
evening
the
devotees
when
they
came
to
church
for
the
benediction
and
don
cirino
when
he
went
about
shaking
his
keys
before
shutting
up
for
the
night
found
her
there
in
the
same
place
with
her
face
bent
down
upon
her
knees
and
they
called
her
too
the
of
she
is
right
they
said
in
the
village
luca
would
have
been
back
before
long
and
there
would
have
been
the
thirty
sous
a
day
more
to
the
good
for
the
family
to
the
sinking
ship
all
winds
blow
have
you
seen
padron
ntoni
added
goosefoot
since
his
grandson
s
death
he
looks
just
like
an
old
owl
the
house
by
the
medlar
is
full
of
cracks
and
leaks
and
every
one
who
wants
to
save
his
money
had
better
look
out
for
la
zuppidda
was
always
as
cross
as
a
fury
and
went
on
muttering
that
now
the
whole
family
would
be
left
on
ntoni
s
hands
this
time
any
girl
might
think
twice
about
marrying
him
when
mena
is
married
replied
ntoni
grandpapa
will
let
us
have
the
room
i
m
not
accustomed
to
live
in
a
room
like
the
pigeons
snapped
out
barbara
so
savagely
that
her
own
father
said
to
ntoni
looking
about
as
he
walked
with
him
up
the
lane
barbara
is
growing
just
like
her
mother
if
you
don
t
get
the
better
of
her
now
you
ll
lead
just
such
a
life
as
i
the
end
was
that
goosefoot
swore
his
usual
oath
by
the
big
holy
devil
that
this
time
he
would
be
paid
midsummer
was
come
and
the
malavoglia
were
once
more
talking
of
paying
on
account
because
they
had
not
got
together
the
whole
sum
and
hoped
to
pick
it
up
at
the
olive
harvest
he
had
taken
those
pence
out
of
his
own
mouth
and
hadn
t
bread
to
eat
before
god
he
hadn
t
he
couldn
t
live
upon
air
until
the
olive
harvest
i
m
sorry
padron
ntoni
he
said
but
what
will
you
have
i
must
think
of
my
own
interest
first
even
saint
joseph
shaved
himself
first
and
then
the
it
will
soon
be
a
year
that
it
has
been
going
on
added
uncle
crucifix
when
he
was
growling
with
uncle
tino
alone
and
not
one
centime
of
interest
have
i
touched
those
two
hundred
lire
will
hardly
cover
the
expenses
you
ll
see
that
at
the
time
of
olives
they
ll
put
you
off
till
christmas
and
then
till
easter
again
that
s
the
way
people
are
ruined
but
i
have
made
my
money
by
the
sweat
of
my
brow
now
one
of
them
is
in
paradise
the
other
wants
to
marry
la
zuppidda
they
ll
never
be
able
to
get
on
with
that
old
boat
and
they
are
trying
to
marry
the
girl
they
never
think
of
anything
but
marrying
those
people
they
have
a
madness
for
it
like
my
niece
vespa
now
when
mena
is
married
you
ll
see
that
mosca
ll
come
back
and
carry
her
off
with
her
he
wound
up
by
scolding
about
the
lawyer
who
took
such
a
time
about
the
papers
before
he
sent
in
the
summons
padron
ntoni
will
have
been
there
to
tell
him
to
wait
suggested
goosefoot
with
an
ounce
of
pitch
one
can
buy
ten
such
lawyers
as
this
time
he
had
quarrelled
seriously
with
the
malavoglia
because
la
zuppidda
had
taken
his
wife
s
clothes
out
of
the
bottom
of
the
tank
and
had
put
hers
in
their
place
such
a
mean
thing
as
that
he
could
not
bear
la
zuppidda
wouldn
t
have
thought
of
it
if
she
hadn
t
got
that
of
a
ntoni
malavoglia
behind
her
a
bully
that
he
was
a
lot
they
were
the
malavoglia
and
he
didn
t
want
to
see
any
more
of
them
swearing
and
blaspheming
as
his
wont
was
the
stamped
paper
began
to
rain
in
on
them
and
goosefoot
declared
that
the
lawyer
couldn
t
have
been
content
with
the
bribe
padron
ntoni
had
given
him
to
let
them
alone
and
that
proved
what
a
miser
he
was
and
how
much
he
was
to
be
trusted
when
he
promised
to
pay
what
he
owed
people
padron
ntoni
went
back
to
the
and
to
the
lawyer
scipione
but
he
laughed
in
his
face
and
told
him
that
he
was
a
fool
for
his
pains
that
he
should
never
have
let
his
give
in
to
it
and
as
he
had
made
his
bed
so
he
must
lie
down
woe
to
the
fallen
man
who
asks
for
help
listen
to
me
suggested
don
silvestro
you
d
better
let
them
have
the
house
if
not
they
ll
take
the
and
everything
else
even
to
the
hair
off
your
head
and
you
lose
all
your
time
besides
running
backward
and
forward
to
the
if
you
give
up
the
house
quietly
said
to
the
old
man
we
ll
leave
you
the
and
you
ll
be
able
to
earn
your
bread
and
will
remain
master
of
your
ship
and
not
be
troubled
with
any
more
stamped
after
all
cousin
tino
wasn
t
such
a
bad
fellow
he
went
on
talking
to
padron
ntoni
as
if
it
hadn
t
been
his
affair
at
all
passing
his
arm
over
his
shoulder
and
saying
to
him
pardon
me
brother
i
am
more
sorry
than
you
are
it
goes
to
my
heart
to
turn
you
out
of
your
house
but
what
can
i
do
i
m
only
a
poor
devil
i
m
not
rich
like
uncle
crucifix
if
those
five
hundred
lire
hadn
t
come
actually
out
of
my
very
mouth
i
would
never
have
troubled
you
about
them
upon
my
word
i
wouldn
the
poor
old
man
hadn
t
the
courage
to
tell
his
that
she
must
go
quietly
out
of
the
house
by
the
after
so
many
years
that
they
had
been
there
it
was
like
going
into
banishment
or
like
those
who
had
gone
away
meaning
to
come
back
and
had
come
back
no
more
and
there
was
luca
s
bed
there
and
the
nail
where
bastianazzo
s
used
to
hang
but
at
last
the
time
came
that
they
had
to
move
with
all
those
poor
sticks
of
furniture
and
take
them
out
of
their
old
places
where
each
left
a
mark
on
the
wall
where
it
had
stood
and
the
house
without
them
looked
strange
and
unlike
itself
they
carried
their
things
out
by
night
into
the
sexton
s
cottage
which
they
had
hired
as
if
everybody
in
the
place
didn
t
know
that
now
the
house
belonged
no
more
to
them
but
to
goosefoot
and
that
they
had
to
move
away
from
it
but
at
all
events
no
one
saw
them
carrying
their
things
from
one
house
to
the
other
every
time
the
old
man
pulled
out
a
nail
or
moved
a
cupboard
from
the
corner
where
it
was
used
to
stand
he
shook
his
poor
old
head
then
the
others
when
all
was
done
sat
down
upon
a
heap
of
straw
in
the
middle
of
the
room
to
rest
and
looked
about
here
and
there
to
see
if
anything
had
been
forgotten
but
the
grandfather
could
not
stay
inside
and
went
out
into
the
court
in
the
open
air
but
there
too
was
the
scattered
straw
and
broken
crockery
and
coils
of
old
rope
and
in
a
corner
the
and
the
vine
hanging
in
clusters
over
the
door
come
boys
let
s
go
sooner
or
later
we
must
and
never
moved
maruzza
looked
at
the
door
of
the
court
out
of
which
luca
and
bastianazzo
had
gone
for
the
last
time
and
the
lane
where
she
had
watched
her
boy
go
off
through
the
rain
with
his
trousers
turned
up
and
then
thought
how
the
cape
had
hidden
him
from
her
view
cousin
alfio
mosca
s
window
too
was
shut
close
and
the
vine
hung
over
the
way
so
that
every
one
who
passed
by
plucked
off
its
grapes
each
one
had
something
in
the
house
which
it
was
specially
hard
to
leave
and
the
old
man
in
passing
out
laid
his
head
softly
in
the
dark
on
the
old
door
which
uncle
crucifix
had
said
was
in
need
of
a
good
piece
of
wood
and
a
handful
of
nails
uncle
crucifix
had
come
to
look
over
the
house
and
goosefoot
with
him
and
they
talked
loud
in
the
empty
rooms
where
the
voices
rang
as
if
they
had
been
in
a
church
cousin
tino
hadn
t
been
able
to
live
all
that
time
upon
air
and
had
sold
everything
to
old
to
get
back
his
money
what
can
i
do
cousin
malavoglia
he
said
passing
his
arm
over
his
shoulder
you
know
i
m
only
a
poor
devil
and
can
t
spare
five
hundred
lire
if
you
had
been
rich
i
d
have
sold
the
house
to
but
padron
ntoni
couldn
t
bear
to
go
about
the
house
like
that
with
goosefoot
s
arm
on
his
shoulder
now
uncle
crucifix
was
come
with
the
carpenter
and
the
mason
and
a
lot
of
people
who
ran
about
the
place
as
if
they
had
been
in
the
public
square
and
said
here
must
go
bricks
here
a
new
beam
here
the
floor
must
all
be
done
over
as
if
they
had
been
the
masters
and
they
talked
too
of
whitewashing
it
all
over
and
making
it
look
quite
a
different
thing
uncle
crucifix
went
about
kicking
the
straw
and
the
broken
rubbish
out
of
the
way
and
picking
up
off
the
floor
a
bit
of
an
old
hat
that
had
belonged
to
bastianazzo
he
flung
it
out
of
the
window
into
the
garden
saying
it
was
good
for
manure
the
rustled
softly
meanwhile
and
the
garlands
of
daisies
now
withered
that
had
been
put
up
at
whitsuntide
still
hung
over
the
windows
and
the
door
from
this
time
the
malavoglia
never
showed
themselves
in
the
street
or
at
church
and
went
all
the
way
to
aci
castello
to
the
mass
and
no
one
spoke
to
them
any
more
not
even
padron
cipolla
who
went
about
saying
padron
ntoni
had
no
right
to
play
me
such
a
trick
as
that
that
was
real
cheating
to
let
his
give
up
her
rights
for
the
sake
of
the
debt
for
the
just
what
my
wife
says
added
master
zuppiddu
she
says
even
the
dogs
in
the
street
wouldn
t
have
any
of
the
malavoglia
all
the
same
that
young
heathen
brasi
howled
and
swore
that
he
wanted
mena
she
had
been
promised
him
and
he
would
have
her
and
he
stamped
and
stormed
like
a
baby
before
a
toyshop
at
a
fair
do
you
think
i
stole
my
property
you
lazy
hound
that
you
want
to
fling
it
away
with
a
lot
of
beggars
shouted
his
father
they
even
took
back
brasi
s
new
clothes
and
he
worked
out
his
by
chasing
lizards
on
the
down
or
sitting
astride
of
the
wall
by
the
swearing
that
he
wouldn
t
do
a
hand
s
turn
no
that
he
wouldn
t
not
if
they
killed
him
for
it
now
that
they
wouldn
t
give
him
his
wife
and
they
had
taken
back
even
his
fortunately
mena
couldn
t
see
him
looking
as
he
did
now
for
the
malavoglia
always
kept
the
door
shut
down
there
at
the
sexton
s
cottage
which
they
had
hired
in
the
black
street
near
the
zuppiddi
and
if
brasi
chanced
to
see
any
of
them
if
it
were
ever
so
far
off
he
ran
to
hide
himself
behind
a
wall
or
among
the
mena
was
quite
tranquil
however
there
was
so
much
to
do
in
the
new
house
where
they
had
to
find
places
for
all
the
old
things
and
where
there
was
no
longer
the
nor
could
one
see
cousin
anna
s
door
or
nunziata
s
her
mother
watched
over
her
like
a
brooding
bird
while
they
sat
working
together
and
her
voice
was
like
a
caress
when
she
said
to
her
give
me
the
scissors
or
hold
this
skein
for
me
so
that
the
child
felt
it
in
her
inmost
heart
now
that
every
one
turned
away
from
them
but
the
girl
sang
like
a
lark
for
she
was
but
eighteen
and
at
that
age
if
the
sun
do
but
shine
everything
seems
bright
and
the
singing
of
the
birds
is
in
one
s
heart
besides
she
had
never
really
cared
for
that
person
she
said
to
her
mother
in
a
whisper
as
they
bent
together
over
the
loom
her
mother
had
been
the
only
one
who
had
really
understood
her
and
had
had
a
kind
word
for
her
in
that
hard
time
at
least
if
cousin
alfio
had
been
there
he
would
not
have
turned
his
back
upon
them
so
goes
the
world
every
one
must
look
out
for
himself
and
so
said
cousin
venera
to
padron
ntoni
s
ntoni
every
one
must
see
to
his
own
beard
first
and
then
to
the
others
your
grandfather
gives
you
nothing
what
claim
has
he
on
you
if
you
marry
that
means
that
you
must
set
up
house
for
yourself
and
what
you
earn
must
be
for
your
own
house
and
your
own
family
many
hands
are
a
blessing
but
not
all
in
one
that
would
be
a
fine
thing
to
do
to
be
sure
answered
ntoni
now
that
my
relations
are
on
the
street
am
i
to
throw
them
over
how
is
my
grandfather
to
manage
the
and
to
feed
them
all
without
me
then
get
out
of
it
the
best
way
you
can
exclaimed
la
zuppidda
turning
away
from
him
to
hunt
over
the
drawers
or
in
the
kitchen
upsetting
everything
here
and
there
making
believe
to
be
ever
so
busy
not
to
have
to
look
him
in
the
face
i
didn
t
steal
my
daughter
you
can
go
on
by
yourselves
because
you
are
young
and
strong
and
can
work
and
have
your
trade
at
your
all
the
more
now
that
there
are
so
few
young
men
with
this
devil
of
a
conscription
sweeping
off
all
the
village
every
year
but
if
i
m
to
give
you
the
dowry
to
spend
it
on
your
own
people
that
s
another
affair
i
mean
to
give
my
daughter
to
one
husband
not
to
five
or
six
and
i
don
t
mean
she
shall
have
two
families
on
her
barbara
in
the
other
room
feigned
not
to
hear
and
went
on
plying
her
shuttle
briskly
all
the
time
but
if
ntoni
appeared
at
the
door
she
cast
down
her
eyes
and
wouldn
t
look
at
him
the
poor
fellow
turned
yellow
and
green
and
all
sorts
of
colors
for
she
had
caught
him
like
a
limed
sparrow
with
those
great
black
eyes
of
hers
and
then
she
said
to
him
after
her
mother
was
gone
i
m
sure
you
don
t
love
me
as
much
as
you
do
your
own
people
and
began
to
cry
with
her
apron
over
her
head
i
swear
exclaimed
ntoni
i
wish
i
could
go
back
to
soldiering
again
and
tore
his
hair
and
thumped
himself
in
the
head
but
couldn
t
come
to
any
decision
one
way
or
the
other
like
the
that
he
was
then
cried
the
zuppidda
come
come
each
to
his
own
home
and
her
husband
went
on
repeating
didn
t
i
tell
you
i
didn
t
choose
to
have
a
fuss
you
be
off
to
your
work
replied
she
you
know
nothing
about
ntoni
every
time
he
went
to
the
zuppiddi
found
them
in
an
and
cousin
venera
went
on
throwing
in
his
face
that
time
that
his
people
had
asked
goosefoot
s
wife
to
dress
mena
s
hair
and
a
fine
they
d
made
of
it
licking
cousin
tino
s
boots
because
of
that
twopenny
business
of
the
house
and
he
d
taken
the
house
all
the
same
then
cousin
venera
if
you
speak
in
this
way
i
suppose
you
mean
i
don
t
want
you
in
my
house
any
ntoni
meant
to
play
the
man
and
did
not
show
himself
again
for
two
or
three
days
but
little
lia
who
knew
nothing
of
all
this
chatter
still
continued
to
go
to
play
in
the
court
at
cousin
venera
s
as
they
had
taught
her
to
do
in
the
days
when
barbara
used
to
give
her
chestnuts
and
indian
figs
for
love
of
her
brother
ntoni
only
now
they
gave
her
nothing
and
la
zuppidda
said
to
her
have
you
come
here
to
look
for
your
brother
does
your
mother
think
we
want
to
steal
your
precious
brother
things
came
to
such
a
pass
that
la
longa
and
la
venera
did
not
speak
and
turned
their
backs
upon
each
other
if
they
met
at
church
ntoni
bewitched
by
barbara
s
eyes
went
back
to
stand
before
the
windows
trying
to
make
peace
so
that
cousin
venera
threatened
to
fling
water
over
him
one
time
or
another
and
even
her
daughter
shrugged
her
shoulders
at
him
now
that
the
malavoglia
had
neither
king
nor
kingdom
and
she
said
it
to
his
face
too
to
be
rid
of
him
for
he
stood
like
a
dog
always
in
front
of
the
window
and
might
stand
in
the
way
of
a
better
match
too
if
any
one
were
to
come
that
way
for
her
now
then
cousin
ntoni
the
fish
of
the
sea
are
destined
for
those
who
shall
eat
them
let
s
make
up
our
minds
to
say
and
have
it
you
may
say
to
it
all
cousin
barbara
but
i
can
t
love
isn
t
over
so
easily
as
that
with
try
i
guess
you
can
manage
it
there
s
nothing
like
trying
i
wish
you
all
the
good
in
the
world
but
leave
me
to
look
after
my
own
affairs
for
i
am
already
i
knew
it
would
come
to
this
when
they
took
our
house
and
everybody
turned
their
backs
on
listen
cousin
ntoni
my
mother
may
come
at
any
minute
and
it
won
t
do
for
her
to
find
you
yes
yes
i
know
now
that
they
ve
taken
our
house
it
isn
t
poor
ntoni
s
heart
was
full
he
couldn
t
bear
to
part
from
her
like
that
but
she
had
to
go
to
the
fountain
to
fill
her
pitcher
and
she
said
adieu
to
him
walking
off
quickly
swaying
lightly
as
she
went
for
though
they
were
called
hobblers
because
her
had
broken
his
leg
in
a
collision
of
wagons
at
the
fair
of
trecastagni
barbara
had
both
her
legs
and
very
good
ones
too
adieu
cousin
barbara
said
the
poor
fellow
and
so
he
put
a
stone
over
all
that
had
been
and
went
back
to
his
oar
like
a
and
s
work
it
was
from
monday
morning
till
saturday
night
and
he
was
tired
of
wearing
out
his
soul
for
nothing
for
when
one
has
nothing
what
good
can
come
of
driving
away
from
morning
till
night
with
never
a
dog
to
be
friends
with
one
either
and
for
that
he
had
had
enough
of
such
a
life
he
preferred
rather
to
do
nothing
at
all
and
stay
in
bed
as
if
he
were
sick
as
they
did
on
board
ship
when
the
service
was
too
hard
for
the
grandpapa
wouldn
t
come
to
pull
him
and
thump
him
like
the
ship
s
doctor
what
s
the
matter
he
asked
nothing
only
i
m
a
poor
miserable
and
what
can
be
done
for
you
if
you
are
a
poor
miserable
devil
we
must
go
on
as
we
come
into
the
he
let
himself
be
loaded
down
with
tackle
like
a
beast
of
burden
and
the
whole
day
long
never
opened
his
mouth
except
to
growl
and
to
swear
on
sunday
ntoni
went
hanging
about
the
tavern
where
people
did
nothing
but
laugh
and
amuse
themselves
or
else
he
sat
for
whole
hours
on
the
church
steps
with
his
chin
in
his
hands
watching
the
people
passing
by
and
pondering
over
this
hard
life
where
there
was
nothing
to
be
got
by
doing
anything
at
least
on
sunday
there
was
something
that
cost
nothing
the
sun
the
standing
idle
with
hands
in
one
s
pockets
and
then
he
grew
tired
even
of
thinking
of
his
hard
fate
and
longing
to
bask
again
in
the
strange
places
he
had
seen
when
he
was
a
soldier
and
with
the
memory
of
which
he
amused
himself
on
he
only
cared
to
lie
like
a
lizard
basking
in
the
sun
and
when
the
carters
passed
sitting
on
their
shafts
he
muttered
they
have
an
easy
time
of
it
driving
about
like
that
all
day
long
and
when
some
poor
little
old
woman
came
from
the
town
bent
down
under
her
heavy
burden
like
a
tired
donkey
lamenting
as
she
went
as
is
the
manner
of
the
old
he
said
to
her
by
way
of
consolation
i
would
be
willing
to
take
your
work
my
sister
after
all
it
is
like
going
out
for
a
padron
ntoni
would
go
off
to
old
crucifix
saying
to
him
over
and
over
again
at
least
a
hundred
times
you
know
uncle
crucifix
if
we
can
manage
to
put
the
money
together
for
the
house
you
must
sell
it
to
us
and
to
nobody
else
for
it
has
always
belonged
to
the
malavoglia
and
his
own
nest
every
bird
likes
best
and
i
long
to
die
in
my
own
bed
blest
is
he
who
dies
in
the
bed
where
he
was
uncle
crucifix
muttered
something
which
sounded
like
yes
not
to
compromise
himself
and
then
would
go
off
and
put
a
new
tile
or
a
patch
of
lime
on
the
wall
of
the
court
to
make
an
excuse
for
raising
the
price
of
the
house
uncle
crucifix
would
reassure
him
in
this
way
never
fear
never
fear
the
house
won
t
run
away
you
know
only
keep
an
eye
upon
it
every
one
should
keep
an
eye
upon
whatever
he
sets
store
and
once
he
went
on
isn
t
your
mena
going
to
be
married
she
shall
be
married
when
it
shall
please
god
replied
padron
ntoni
for
my
part
i
should
be
glad
if
it
were
to
be
if
i
were
you
i
would
give
her
to
alfio
mosca
he
s
a
nice
young
fellow
honest
and
always
looking
out
for
a
wife
everywhere
he
goes
it
is
the
only
fault
he
has
now
they
say
he
s
coming
back
to
the
place
he
s
cut
out
for
your
but
they
said
he
wanted
to
marry
your
niece
you
too
you
too
began
to
scream
in
his
cracked
voice
who
says
so
that
s
all
idle
chatter
he
wants
to
get
hold
of
her
ground
that
s
what
he
wants
a
pretty
thing
that
would
be
how
would
you
like
me
to
sell
your
house
to
somebody
else
and
goosefoot
who
was
always
hanging
about
the
piazza
ready
to
put
in
his
oar
whenever
he
saw
two
people
talking
together
broke
in
with
vespa
has
brasi
cipolla
in
her
head
just
now
since
his
marriage
with
sant
agata
is
broken
off
i
saw
them
with
my
own
eyes
walking
down
the
path
by
the
stream
a
nice
lot
eh
screamed
uncle
crucifix
quite
forgetting
his
deafness
that
witch
is
the
devil
himself
we
must
tell
padron
fortunato
about
it
that
we
must
are
we
honest
men
or
are
we
not
if
padron
fortunato
doesn
t
look
out
that
witch
of
a
niece
of
mine
will
carry
off
his
son
before
his
eyes
poor
old
and
off
he
ran
up
the
street
like
a
madman
in
less
than
ten
minutes
uncle
crucifix
had
turned
the
place
wanting
to
call
don
michele
and
his
guest
to
look
up
his
niece
for
after
all
she
was
his
niece
and
belonged
to
him
and
wasn
t
don
michele
paid
to
look
after
what
belonged
to
honest
men
everybody
laughed
to
see
padron
cipolla
running
hither
and
thither
panting
like
a
dog
with
his
tongue
out
after
his
great
lout
of
a
son
and
said
it
was
no
more
than
he
deserved
that
his
son
should
be
snapped
up
by
the
wasp
when
he
thought
victor
emmanuel
s
daughter
hardly
good
enough
for
him
and
had
broken
off
with
the
malavoglia
without
even
saying
by
your
mena
had
not
put
on
mourning
however
when
her
marriage
went
off
on
the
contrary
she
began
once
more
to
sing
at
her
loom
and
while
she
was
helping
to
salt
down
the
anchovies
in
the
fine
summer
evenings
for
saint
francis
had
sent
that
year
such
a
provision
as
never
was
a
of
anchovies
such
as
no
one
could
remember
in
any
past
year
enough
to
enrich
the
whole
place
the
barks
came
in
loaded
with
the
men
on
board
singing
and
shouting
and
waving
their
caps
above
their
heads
in
sign
of
success
to
the
women
and
children
who
waited
for
them
on
the
shore
the
buyers
came
from
the
city
in
crowds
on
foot
on
horseback
and
in
carts
and
wagons
and
goosefoot
hadn
t
even
time
to
scratch
his
head
towards
sunset
there
was
a
crowd
like
a
fair
and
cries
and
jostling
and
pushing
so
as
no
one
ever
saw
the
like
in
the
malavoglia
s
court
the
lights
were
burning
until
midnight
as
if
there
were
a
festa
there
the
girls
sang
and
the
neighbors
came
to
help
their
cousin
anna
s
daughters
and
nunziata
because
every
one
could
earn
something
and
along
the
wall
were
four
ranges
of
barrels
all
ready
prepared
with
stones
on
the
top
of
them
i
wish
the
zuppidda
were
here
now
exclaimed
ntoni
sitting
on
the
stones
to
make
weight
and
folding
his
arms
then
she
would
see
that
we
can
manage
for
ourselves
as
good
as
anybody
and
snap
our
fingers
at
don
michele
and
don
the
buyers
ran
after
padron
ntoni
with
money
down
in
their
hands
goosefoot
pulled
him
by
the
sleeve
saying
now
s
your
time
make
your
profit
while
you
but
padron
ntoni
would
only
answer
wait
till
all
saints
that
s
the
time
to
sell
anchovies
no
i
won
t
take
i
don
t
mean
to
be
tied
i
know
how
things
will
and
he
thumped
on
the
barrels
with
his
fist
saying
to
his
grandchildren
here
is
your
house
and
mena
s
dowry
and
the
old
house
is
ready
to
take
you
to
its
arms
saint
francis
has
been
merciful
i
shall
close
my
eyes
in
at
the
same
time
they
had
made
all
their
provision
for
the
winter
grain
beans
oil
and
had
given
earnest
to
don
filippo
for
a
little
wine
for
sundays
now
they
were
tranquil
once
more
father
and
began
once
more
to
count
the
money
in
the
stocking
and
the
barrels
ranged
against
the
wall
of
the
court
and
made
their
calculations
as
to
what
more
was
needed
for
the
house
maruzza
knew
the
money
coin
from
coin
and
said
this
from
the
oranges
and
eggs
this
from
for
work
at
the
railroad
this
mena
earned
at
the
loom
and
she
said
too
each
has
something
here
from
his
own
did
i
not
tell
you
said
padron
ntoni
that
to
pull
a
good
oar
all
the
five
fingers
must
help
each
other
now
there
is
but
little
more
and
then
he
would
go
off
into
a
corner
with
la
longa
and
they
would
have
a
great
confabulation
looking
from
time
to
time
at
sant
agata
who
deserved
poor
child
that
they
should
talk
of
her
because
she
had
neither
word
nor
will
of
her
own
and
attended
to
her
work
singing
softly
under
her
breath
like
a
bird
on
its
nest
before
the
break
of
morning
and
only
when
she
heard
the
carts
pass
on
the
highroad
in
the
evening
she
thought
of
cousin
alfio
mosca
s
cart
that
was
wandering
about
the
wide
world
she
knew
not
where
and
then
she
stopped
singing
in
the
whole
place
nothing
was
seen
but
men
carrying
nets
and
women
sitting
in
their
doors
pounding
salt
and
broken
bricks
together
and
before
every
door
was
a
row
of
tiny
barrels
so
that
it
was
a
real
pleasure
to
a
christian
to
snuff
the
precious
odor
as
he
passed
and
for
a
mile
away
the
breath
of
the
gifts
of
the
blessed
saint
francis
floated
on
the
breeze
there
was
nothing
talked
of
but
anchovies
and
brine
even
in
the
where
all
the
affairs
of
all
the
world
were
discussed
don
franco
wanted
to
teach
them
a
new
way
of
salting
down
a
receipt
which
he
had
found
in
a
book
they
turned
their
backs
on
him
and
left
him
storming
like
a
madman
since
the
world
was
a
world
anchovies
had
always
been
cured
with
salt
and
pounded
bricks
the
usual
cry
my
grandfather
used
to
do
it
the
druggist
went
on
shouting
at
them
you
want
nothing
but
tails
to
be
complete
asses
what
is
to
be
done
with
such
a
lot
as
this
and
they
are
quite
contented
too
with
master
croce
giufà
which
means
oaf
because
he
has
always
been
syndic
they
would
be
capable
of
saying
that
they
didn
t
want
a
republic
because
they
had
never
seen
this
speech
he
repeated
to
don
silvestro
on
a
certain
occasion
when
they
had
a
conversation
without
witnesses
that
is
to
say
don
franco
talked
and
don
silvestro
listened
in
silence
he
afterwards
learned
that
don
silvestro
had
broken
with
betta
the
syndic
s
daughter
because
she
insisted
on
being
syndic
herself
and
her
father
let
her
wear
the
breeches
so
that
he
said
white
and
black
x
went
out
to
sea
every
blessed
day
and
had
to
row
tiring
his
back
dreadfully
but
when
the
sea
was
high
and
fit
to
swallow
them
all
at
one
gulp
them
the
and
everything
else
that
boy
had
a
heart
as
brave
as
the
sea
itself
malavoglia
blood
said
his
grandfather
and
it
was
fine
to
see
him
at
work
in
a
storm
with
the
wind
whistling
through
his
hair
while
the
bark
sprang
over
the
big
waves
like
a
porpoise
in
the
spring
the
often
ventured
out
into
blue
water
old
and
patched
though
she
was
after
that
little
handful
of
fish
which
was
hard
to
find
now
that
the
sea
was
swept
from
side
to
side
as
if
with
brooms
even
on
those
dark
days
when
the
clouds
hung
low
over
agnone
and
the
horizon
to
the
east
was
full
of
black
shadows
the
sail
of
the
provvidenza
might
be
seen
like
a
white
handkerchief
against
the
sea
and
everybody
said
that
padron
ntoni
s
people
went
out
to
look
for
trouble
like
the
old
woman
with
a
lamp
padron
ntoni
replied
that
he
went
out
to
look
for
bread
and
when
the
corks
disappeared
one
by
one
in
the
wide
sea
gleaming
green
as
grass
and
the
houses
of
trezza
looked
like
a
little
white
spot
so
far
off
were
they
and
there
was
nothing
all
around
them
but
water
he
began
to
talk
to
his
grandsons
in
sheer
pleasure
la
longa
and
the
others
would
come
down
to
the
beach
to
meet
them
on
the
shore
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
sail
rounding
the
fariglione
and
when
they
too
had
been
to
look
at
the
fish
flashing
through
the
nets
and
looking
as
if
the
bottom
of
the
boat
were
full
of
molten
silver
and
padron
ntoni
replied
before
any
one
had
asked
yes
a
quintal
or
a
quintal
generally
right
even
to
an
ounce
and
then
they
d
sit
talking
about
it
all
the
evening
while
the
women
pounded
salt
in
the
wooden
mortars
and
when
they
counted
the
little
barrels
one
by
one
and
uncle
crucifix
came
in
to
see
how
they
had
got
on
to
make
his
offer
so
with
his
eyes
shut
and
goosefoot
came
too
screaming
and
scolding
about
the
right
price
and
the
just
price
and
so
on
then
they
didn
t
mind
his
screaming
because
after
all
it
was
a
pity
to
quarrel
with
old
friends
and
then
la
longa
would
go
on
counting
out
sou
by
sou
the
money
which
goosefoot
had
brought
in
his
handkerchief
saying
these
are
for
the
house
these
are
for
the
expenses
and
so
on
mena
would
help
too
to
pound
the
salt
and
to
count
the
barrels
and
she
should
get
back
her
blue
jacket
and
her
coral
necklace
that
had
been
pawned
to
uncle
crucifix
and
the
women
could
go
back
to
their
own
church
again
for
if
any
young
man
happened
to
look
after
mena
her
dowry
was
getting
ready
for
my
part
said
ntoni
rowing
slowly
slowly
round
and
round
so
that
the
current
should
not
drive
him
out
of
the
circle
of
the
net
while
the
old
man
pondered
silently
over
all
these
things
for
my
part
all
i
wish
is
that
hussy
barbara
may
be
left
to
gnaw
her
elbows
when
we
have
got
back
our
own
again
and
may
live
to
repent
shutting
the
door
in
my
in
the
storm
one
knows
the
good
pilot
said
the
old
man
when
we
are
once
more
what
we
have
always
been
every
one
will
bear
a
smooth
face
for
us
and
will
open
their
doors
to
us
once
there
were
two
who
did
not
shut
their
doors
said
alessio
nunziata
and
our
cousin
in
prison
in
poverty
and
in
sickness
one
finds
one
s
friends
for
that
may
the
lord
help
them
too
and
all
the
mouths
they
have
to
feed
when
nunziata
goes
out
on
the
downs
to
gather
wood
or
when
the
rolls
of
linen
are
too
heavy
for
her
i
go
and
help
her
too
poor
little
thing
said
alessio
come
and
help
now
to
pull
in
this
side
for
this
time
saint
francis
has
really
sent
us
the
gift
of
god
and
the
boy
pulled
and
puffed
with
his
feet
braced
against
the
side
of
the
boat
so
that
one
would
have
thought
he
was
doing
it
all
himself
meanwhile
ntoni
lay
stretched
on
the
deck
singing
to
himself
with
his
hands
under
his
head
watching
the
white
gulls
flying
against
the
blue
sky
which
had
no
end
it
rose
so
pure
and
so
high
and
the
rushed
on
the
green
waves
rolling
in
from
farther
than
the
eye
could
see
what
is
the
reason
said
alessio
that
the
sea
is
sometimes
blue
and
sometimes
green
and
then
white
then
again
black
as
the
sand
of
the
beach
and
is
never
all
one
color
as
water
should
be
it
is
the
will
of
god
replied
the
grandfather
so
the
mariner
can
tell
when
he
may
safely
put
out
to
sea
and
when
it
is
best
to
stay
on
those
gulls
have
a
fine
time
of
it
flying
in
the
air
they
need
not
fear
the
waves
when
the
wind
is
but
they
have
nothing
to
eat
either
poor
so
every
one
has
need
of
good
weather
like
nunziata
who
can
t
go
to
the
fountain
when
it
rains
concluded
alessio
neither
good
nor
bad
weather
lasts
forever
observed
the
old
man
but
when
bad
weather
came
and
the
mistral
blew
and
the
corks
went
dancing
on
the
water
all
day
long
as
if
the
devil
were
playing
the
violin
for
them
or
if
the
sea
was
white
as
milk
or
bubbling
up
as
if
it
were
boiling
and
the
rain
came
pouring
down
upon
them
until
evening
so
that
no
wraps
were
proof
against
it
and
the
sea
went
frying
all
about
them
like
oil
in
the
pan
then
it
was
another
pair
of
shoes
and
ntoni
was
in
no
humor
for
singing
with
his
hood
down
to
his
nose
bailing
out
the
that
filled
faster
than
he
could
clear
out
the
water
and
the
grandpapa
went
on
repeating
white
sea
sirocco
there
ll
be
or
curly
sea
fresh
wind
as
if
he
had
come
there
only
to
learn
proverbs
and
with
these
blessed
proverbs
too
he
d
stand
in
the
evening
at
the
window
looking
out
for
the
weather
with
his
nose
in
the
air
and
say
when
the
moon
is
red
it
means
wind
when
it
is
clear
fine
weather
when
it
is
pale
it
means
if
you
know
it
is
going
to
rain
said
ntoni
one
day
why
do
we
go
out
while
we
might
stay
in
bed
an
hour
or
two
longer
water
from
the
sky
sardines
in
the
net
answered
the
old
man
later
on
ntoni
began
to
curse
and
swear
with
the
water
half
up
to
his
knees
this
evening
said
his
grandfather
maruzza
will
have
a
good
fire
ready
for
us
and
we
shall
soon
be
quite
and
at
dusk
when
the
with
her
hull
full
of
the
gifts
of
god
turned
towards
home
with
her
sail
puffing
out
like
donna
rosolina
s
best
petticoat
and
the
lights
of
the
village
came
twinkling
one
by
one
from
behind
the
dark
rocks
as
if
they
were
beckoning
to
each
other
padron
ntoni
showed
his
boys
the
bright
fire
which
burned
in
la
longa
s
kitchen
at
the
bottom
of
the
tiny
court
in
the
narrow
black
street
for
the
wall
was
low
and
from
the
sea
the
whole
house
was
visible
with
the
tiles
built
into
a
shed
for
the
hens
and
the
oven
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
don
t
you
see
what
a
blaze
la
longa
has
got
up
for
us
said
he
in
high
spirits
and
la
longa
was
waiting
for
them
with
the
baskets
ready
when
they
were
brought
back
empty
there
wasn
t
much
talking
but
instead
if
there
were
not
enough
and
alessio
had
to
run
up
to
the
house
for
more
the
grandfather
would
put
his
hands
to
his
mouth
and
shout
mena
oh
mena
and
mena
knew
well
what
it
meant
and
they
all
came
down
in
procession
she
lia
and
nunziata
too
with
all
her
chicks
behind
her
then
there
was
great
joy
and
nobody
minded
cold
or
rain
and
before
the
blazing
fire
they
sat
talking
of
the
gifts
of
god
which
saint
francis
had
sent
them
and
of
what
they
would
do
with
the
money
but
in
this
desperate
game
men
s
lives
are
risked
for
a
few
pounds
of
fish
and
once
the
malavoglia
were
within
a
hair
of
losing
theirs
all
at
once
as
bastianazzo
had
for
the
sake
of
gain
when
they
were
off
agnone
as
the
day
drew
to
a
close
and
the
sky
was
so
dark
that
they
could
not
even
see
etna
and
the
winds
blew
and
swept
up
the
waves
so
close
about
the
boat
that
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
voices
and
could
speak
ugly
weather
said
padron
ntoni
the
wind
turns
like
a
silly
wench
s
head
and
the
face
of
the
sea
looks
like
goosefoot
s
when
he
is
hatching
some
hateful
the
sea
was
as
black
as
the
beach
though
the
sun
had
not
yet
gone
down
and
every
now
and
then
it
hissed
and
seethed
like
a
pot
now
the
gulls
have
all
gone
to
sleep
said
alessio
by
this
time
they
ought
to
have
lighted
the
beacon
at
catania
said
ntoni
but
i
can
t
see
keep
the
rudder
always
ordered
the
grandfather
in
half
an
hour
it
will
be
darker
than
an
on
such
evenings
as
this
it
is
better
to
be
at
santuzza
s
or
asleep
in
your
bed
eh
said
the
old
man
then
you
should
be
a
clerk
like
don
the
poor
old
fellow
had
been
groaning
all
day
with
pain
the
weather
is
going
to
change
he
said
i
feel
it
in
my
all
of
a
sudden
it
grew
so
black
that
one
couldn
t
even
see
to
swear
only
the
waves
as
they
rolled
past
the
shone
like
grinning
teeth
ready
to
devour
her
and
no
one
dared
speak
a
word
in
presence
of
the
sea
that
moaned
over
all
its
waste
of
waters
i
ve
an
idea
said
ntoni
suddenly
that
we
had
better
give
the
fish
we
ve
caught
to
the
silence
said
his
grandfather
and
the
stern
voice
out
of
that
darkness
made
him
shrink
together
like
a
leaf
on
the
bench
where
he
sat
they
heard
the
wind
whistle
in
the
sails
of
the
and
the
ropes
ring
like
the
strings
of
a
guitar
suddenly
the
wind
began
to
scream
like
the
when
the
train
comes
out
from
the
tunnel
in
the
mountain
above
trezza
and
there
came
a
great
wave
from
nobody
knew
where
and
the
rattled
like
a
sack
of
nuts
and
sprang
up
into
the
air
and
then
rolled
over
down
with
the
sail
down
cried
padron
ntoni
cut
away
cut
away
ntoni
with
the
knife
in
his
mouth
scrambled
like
a
cat
out
on
the
yard
and
standing
on
the
very
end
to
balance
himself
hung
over
the
howling
waves
that
leaped
up
to
swallow
him
hold
on
hold
on
cried
the
old
man
to
him
through
all
the
thunder
of
the
waves
that
strove
to
tear
him
down
and
tossed
about
the
and
all
that
was
inside
her
and
flung
the
boat
on
her
side
so
that
the
water
was
up
to
their
knees
cut
away
cut
away
called
out
the
grandfather
again
sacrament
exclaimed
ntoni
and
what
shall
we
do
without
the
sail
then
stop
swearing
we
are
in
the
hands
of
god
alessio
who
was
grasping
the
rudder
with
all
his
force
heard
what
his
grandfather
said
and
began
to
scream
mamma
mamma
mamma
hush
cried
his
brother
as
well
as
he
could
for
the
knife
in
his
teeth
hush
or
i
ll
give
you
a
make
the
holy
sign
and
be
quiet
echoed
the
grandfather
so
that
the
boy
dared
not
make
another
sound
suddenly
the
sail
fell
all
at
once
in
a
heap
and
ntoni
drew
it
in
furling
it
light
quick
as
a
flash
you
know
your
trade
well
as
your
father
did
before
you
said
his
grandfather
you
too
are
a
the
boat
righted
and
gave
one
leap
then
began
to
leap
about
again
among
the
waves
this
way
the
rudder
this
way
now
it
wants
a
strong
arm
said
padron
ntoni
and
though
the
boy
too
clung
to
it
like
a
cat
the
boat
still
sprang
about
and
there
came
great
waves
sweeping
over
it
that
drove
them
against
the
helm
with
force
enough
nearly
to
knock
the
breath
out
of
them
both
the
oars
cried
ntoni
pull
hard
alessio
you
re
strong
enough
when
it
comes
to
eating
just
now
the
oars
are
worth
more
than
the
the
boat
creaked
and
groaned
with
the
strain
of
the
oars
pulled
by
those
strong
young
arms
the
boy
standing
with
his
feet
braced
against
the
deck
put
all
his
soul
into
his
oar
as
well
as
his
brother
hold
hard
cried
the
old
man
who
could
hardly
be
heard
at
the
other
side
of
the
boat
over
the
roaring
of
the
wind
and
the
waves
hold
on
alessio
yes
grandfather
i
do
replied
the
boy
are
you
afraid
asked
ntoni
no
he
s
not
answered
his
grandfather
for
him
but
we
must
commend
ourselves
to
holy
devil
exclaimed
ntoni
here
one
ought
to
have
arms
of
iron
like
the
the
sea
is
getting
the
best
of
the
grandfather
was
silent
listening
to
the
blast
mamma
must
by
this
time
have
come
to
the
shore
to
watch
for
don
t
talk
about
mamma
now
said
the
old
man
it
is
better
not
to
think
about
where
are
we
now
asked
ntoni
after
some
time
hardly
able
to
speak
for
fatigue
in
god
s
hands
answered
the
grandfather
then
let
me
cry
exclaimed
alessio
who
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
he
began
to
scream
aloud
and
to
call
for
his
mother
at
the
top
of
his
voice
in
the
midst
of
the
noise
of
the
wind
and
of
the
sea
and
neither
of
them
had
the
heart
to
scold
him
it
s
all
very
well
your
howling
but
nobody
can
hear
you
and
you
had
best
be
still
said
his
brother
at
last
in
a
voice
so
changed
and
strange
that
he
hardly
knew
it
himself
now
hush
he
went
on
it
is
best
for
you
and
best
for
the
sail
ordered
padron
ntoni
put
her
head
to
the
wind
and
then
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
the
wind
hindered
them
terribly
but
at
last
they
got
the
sail
set
and
the
began
to
dance
over
the
crests
of
the
waves
leaning
to
one
side
like
a
wounded
bird
the
malavoglia
kept
close
together
on
one
side
clinging
to
the
rail
at
that
moment
no
one
spoke
for
when
the
sea
speaks
in
that
tone
no
one
else
dares
to
utter
a
word
only
padron
ntoni
said
over
there
they
are
saying
the
rosary
for
and
no
one
spoke
again
and
they
flew
along
through
the
wild
tempest
and
the
night
that
had
come
on
as
black
as
pitch
the
light
on
the
mole
cried
ntoni
do
you
see
it
to
the
right
shouted
padron
ntoni
to
the
right
it
is
not
the
light
on
the
mole
we
are
driving
on
shore
furl
furl
i
can
t
cried
ntoni
the
rope
s
too
his
voice
was
hardly
to
be
heard
through
the
storm
so
tired
he
was
the
knife
the
knife
quick
alessio
cut
away
cut
away
at
that
moment
a
crash
was
heard
the
righted
suddenly
like
a
still
spring
let
loose
and
they
were
within
one
of
being
flung
into
the
sea
the
spar
with
the
sail
fell
across
the
deck
snapped
like
a
straw
they
heard
a
voice
which
cried
out
as
if
some
one
were
hurt
to
death
who
is
it
who
called
out
demanded
ntoni
aiding
himself
with
his
teeth
and
the
knife
to
clear
away
the
rigging
of
the
sail
which
had
fallen
with
the
mast
across
the
deck
and
covered
everything
suddenly
a
blast
of
wind
took
up
the
sail
and
swept
it
whistling
away
into
the
night
then
the
brothers
were
able
to
disengage
the
wreck
of
the
mast
and
to
fling
it
into
the
sea
the
boat
rose
up
but
padron
ntoni
did
not
rise
nor
did
he
answer
when
ntoni
called
to
him
now
when
the
wind
and
the
sea
are
screaming
their
worst
together
there
is
nothing
more
terrible
than
the
silence
which
comes
instead
of
the
voice
which
should
answer
to
our
call
grandfather
grandfather
called
out
alessio
too
and
in
the
silence
which
followed
the
brothers
felt
the
hair
rise
up
on
their
heads
as
if
it
had
been
alive
the
night
was
so
black
that
they
could
not
see
from
one
end
of
the
boat
to
the
other
and
alessio
was
silent
from
sheer
terror
the
grandfather
was
stretched
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
with
his
head
broken
ntoni
found
him
at
last
by
groping
about
for
him
and
thought
he
was
dead
for
he
did
not
move
nor
even
breathe
the
helm
swung
from
side
to
side
while
the
boat
leaped
up
and
then
plunged
headlong
into
the
hollows
of
the
waves
ah
saint
francis
de
paul
ah
blessed
saint
francis
cried
the
boys
now
that
they
knew
nothing
else
to
do
and
saint
francis
mercifully
heard
while
he
passed
through
the
whirlwind
helping
his
flock
and
spread
his
mantle
under
the
just
as
she
was
ready
to
crash
like
a
rotten
nut
on
the
cliffs
of
the
domes
under
the
lookout
of
the
the
boat
sprang
over
the
rocks
like
a
colt
and
ran
on
shore
burying
her
nose
in
the
sand
courage
courage
cried
the
guards
from
the
shore
here
we
are
here
we
are
and
they
ran
here
and
there
with
lanterns
ready
to
fling
out
ropes
at
last
one
of
the
ropes
fell
across
the
which
trembled
like
a
leaf
and
struck
ntoni
across
the
face
like
a
blow
from
a
whip
but
not
the
gentlest
of
caresses
could
have
seemed
sweeter
to
him
at
that
moment
help
help
he
cried
catching
at
the
rope
which
ran
so
fast
that
he
could
hardly
hold
it
in
his
hands
alessio
came
to
his
assistance
with
all
his
force
and
together
they
gave
it
two
turns
around
the
and
those
on
shore
drew
them
in
padron
ntoni
however
gave
no
sign
of
life
and
when
the
light
was
brought
they
found
his
face
covered
with
blood
and
the
grandsons
thought
him
dead
and
tore
their
hair
but
after
an
hour
or
two
arrived
don
michele
rocco
spatu
vanni
pizzuti
and
all
the
idlers
that
had
been
at
the
tavern
when
the
news
had
come
and
by
force
of
rubbing
and
of
cold
water
they
brought
him
to
himself
and
he
opened
his
eyes
the
poor
old
man
when
he
heard
where
he
was
and
that
there
wanted
less
than
an
hour
to
reach
trezza
asked
them
to
carry
him
home
on
a
ladder
maruzza
mena
and
the
neighbors
screaming
and
beating
their
breasts
in
the
piazza
saw
him
arrive
like
that
stretched
out
on
the
ladder
pale
and
still
as
if
he
had
been
dead
tis
nothing
tis
nothing
called
out
don
michele
at
the
head
of
the
crowd
tis
only
a
slight
and
he
went
off
to
the
druggist
s
for
the
thieves
vinegar
don
franco
came
himself
with
it
holding
the
bottle
with
both
hands
and
too
came
running
and
his
wife
and
dumbbell
and
the
zuppiddi
and
padron
cipolla
and
all
the
neighborhood
for
at
such
a
time
all
differences
are
forgotten
there
came
even
poor
la
locca
who
always
went
wherever
there
was
a
crowd
or
a
bustle
by
night
or
by
day
as
if
she
never
slept
but
was
always
seeking
her
lost
menico
so
that
the
people
were
crowded
in
the
little
street
before
the
malavoglia
s
house
as
if
a
corpse
had
been
there
and
their
cousin
anna
had
to
shut
the
door
in
their
faces
let
me
in
let
me
in
cried
nunziata
pounding
with
her
fist
on
the
door
having
run
over
only
half
dressed
let
me
in
to
see
what
has
happened
to
cousin
maruzza
what
good
was
it
sending
us
for
the
ladder
if
we
can
t
come
in
and
see
what
s
going
on
shouted
the
son
of
la
locca
the
zuppidda
and
the
mangiacarubbe
had
forgotten
all
the
hard
words
that
had
passed
between
them
and
stood
chatting
before
the
door
with
hands
under
their
aprons
yes
it
was
always
so
with
this
trade
and
it
was
bound
to
finish
this
way
one
day
or
another
whoever
marries
their
daughter
to
a
seafaring
man
is
sure
to
see
her
come
back
to
the
house
a
widow
and
with
children
into
the
bargain
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
don
michele
there
would
have
remained
not
one
of
the
malavoglia
to
carry
on
the
family
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
do
nothing
like
those
people
who
got
paid
for
just
that
like
don
michele
for
example
why
he
was
as
big
and
as
fat
as
a
canon
and
he
ate
as
much
as
ten
men
and
everybody
smoothed
him
down
the
right
way
even
the
druggist
that
was
always
railing
at
the
king
took
off
his
great
ugly
black
hat
to
him
it
will
be
nothing
said
don
franco
coming
out
of
the
house
we
have
bandaged
his
head
properly
but
if
fever
doesn
t
come
on
i
won
t
answer
for
goosefoot
insisted
on
going
in
because
he
was
one
of
the
family
almost
and
padron
fortunato
and
as
many
more
as
could
manage
to
pass
i
don
t
like
the
looks
of
him
a
bit
pronounced
padron
cipolla
shaking
his
head
how
do
you
feel
cousin
ntoni
for
two
or
three
days
padron
ntoni
was
more
dead
than
alive
the
fever
came
on
as
the
apothecary
had
said
it
would
but
it
was
so
strong
that
it
went
nigh
to
carry
the
wounded
man
off
altogether
the
poor
old
fellow
never
complained
but
lay
quiet
in
his
corner
with
his
white
face
and
his
long
beard
and
his
head
bound
up
he
was
only
dreadfully
thirsty
and
when
mena
or
la
longa
gave
him
to
drink
he
caught
hold
of
the
cup
with
both
trembling
hands
and
clung
to
it
as
if
he
feared
it
would
be
taken
from
him
the
doctor
came
every
morning
dressed
the
wound
felt
his
pulse
looked
at
his
tongue
and
went
away
again
shaking
his
head
at
last
there
came
one
evening
when
the
doctor
shook
his
head
more
sadly
than
ever
la
longa
placed
the
image
of
the
madonna
beside
the
bed
and
they
said
their
rosary
around
it
for
the
sick
man
lay
still
and
never
spoke
even
to
ask
for
water
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
even
ceased
to
breathe
nobody
went
to
bed
that
night
and
lia
nearly
broke
her
jaws
yawning
so
sleepy
was
she
the
house
was
so
silent
that
they
could
hear
the
glasses
by
the
bedside
rattle
when
the
carts
passed
by
on
the
road
making
the
watchers
by
the
sick
man
start
so
passed
the
day
too
while
the
neighbors
stood
outside
talking
in
low
tones
and
watching
what
went
on
through
the
towards
evening
padron
ntoni
asked
to
see
each
member
of
his
family
one
by
one
and
looking
at
them
with
dim
sunken
eyes
asked
them
what
the
doctor
had
said
ntoni
was
at
the
head
of
the
bed
crying
like
a
child
for
the
fellow
had
a
kind
heart
don
t
cry
so
said
his
grandfather
don
t
cry
now
you
are
the
head
of
the
house
think
how
they
are
all
on
your
hands
and
do
as
i
have
done
for
the
women
began
to
cry
bitterly
and
to
tear
their
hair
hearing
him
speak
in
that
way
even
little
lia
did
the
same
for
women
have
no
reason
at
such
times
and
did
not
notice
how
the
poor
man
s
face
worked
for
he
could
not
endure
to
see
them
grieve
for
him
in
that
way
but
the
weak
voice
continued
don
t
spend
money
for
me
when
i
am
gone
the
lord
will
know
that
you
have
no
money
and
will
be
content
with
the
rosary
that
mena
and
maruzza
will
say
for
me
and
you
mena
go
on
doing
as
your
mother
has
done
for
she
is
a
saint
of
a
woman
and
has
known
well
how
to
bear
her
sorrows
and
keep
your
little
sister
under
your
wing
as
a
hen
does
her
chickens
as
long
as
you
cling
together
your
sorrows
will
seem
less
bitter
now
ntoni
is
a
man
and
before
long
alessio
will
be
old
enough
to
help
you
don
t
talk
like
that
don
t
for
pity
s
sake
don
t
talk
so
cried
the
women
as
if
it
were
of
his
own
that
he
was
leaving
them
he
shook
his
head
sadly
and
replied
now
i
have
said
all
i
wished
to
say
i
don
t
mind
please
turn
me
on
the
other
side
i
am
tired
i
am
old
you
know
when
the
oil
is
burned
out

lamp

out
later
on
he
called
ntoni
and
said
to
him

t

she
is
so
old
if
you
do
you
will
have
to
go
out
by
the
day
and
you
don
t
know
how
hard
it
is
when
padron
cipolla
or
uncle
cola

nobody

and
another
thing

to
a
seaman
like
her
father
and
a
good
fellow
like

and
i
want

and

by
money
to
buy
back
the
house
by
the
uncle
crucifix

sell
it
if
you
make
it
worth
his
while
for
it
has
always
belonged
to
the
malavoglia
and
thence
your
father
and
luca
went
away
never
to
yes
grandfather
yes
i
will
promised
ntoni
with
many
tears
and
alessio
also
listened
gravely
as
if
he
too
had
been
a
man
the
women
thought
the
sick
man
must
be
wandering
hearing
him
go
on
talking
and
talking
and
they
went
to
put
wet
cloths
on
his
forehead
no
said
padron
ntoni
i
am
in
right
senses
i
only
want
to
finish
what
i
have
to
say
before
i
go
away
from
by
this
time
they
had
begun
to
hear
the
fishermen
calling
from
one
door
to
another
and
the
carts
began
to
pass
along
the
road
in
two
hours
it
will
be
day
said
padron
ntoni
and
you
can
go
call
don
poor
things
they
looked
for
day
as
for
the
messiah
and
went
to
the
window
every
few
minutes
to
look
for
the
dawn
at
last
the
room
grew
lighter
and
padron
ntoni
said
now
go
call
the
priest
for
i
want
to
don
giammaria
came
when
the
sun
had
already
risen
and
all
the
neighbors
when
they
heard
the
bell
tinkle
in
the
black
street
went
after
it
to
see
the
viaticum
going
to
the
malavoglia
and
all
went
in
too
for
when
the
lord
is
within
the
door
can
be
shut
upon
nobody
so
that
the
mourning
family
seeing
the
house
full
of
people
dared
not
weep
nor
cry
while
don
giammaria
muttered
the
prayers
between
his
teeth
and
master
cirino
put
a
candle
to
the
lips
of
the
sick
man
who
lay
pale
and
stiff
as
a
candle
himself
he
looks
just
like
the
patriarch
saint
joseph
in
that
bed
with
that
long
beard
said
santuzza
who
arranged
all
the
bottles
and
straightened
everything
for
she
was
always
about
when
our
lord
went
anywhere
like
a
raven
said
the
druggist
the
doctor
came
while
the
vicar
was
still
there
and
at
first
he
wanted
to
turn
his
donkey
round
and
go
home
again
who
told
you
to
call
the
priest
he
said
that
is
the
doctor
s
affair
and
i
am
astonished
that
don
giammaria
should
have
come
without
a
certificate
do
you
know
what
there
is
no
need
of
the
priest
he
s
better
that
s
what
he
it
is
a
miracle
worked
by
our
lady
of
sorrows
cried
la
longa
our
lady
has
done
this
for
us
for
our
lord
has
come
too
often
to
this
ah
blessed
virgin
ah
holy
virgin
exclaimed
mena
clasping
her
hands
how
gracious
art
thou
to
us
and
they
all
wept
for
joy
as
if
the
sick
man
were
quite
ready
to
get
up
and
be
off
to
his
boat
again
the
doctor
went
off
growling
that
s
always
the
way
if
they
get
well
it
is
our
lady
has
saved
them
if
they
die
it
is
we
who
have
killed
don
michele
is
to
have
the
medal
for
throwing
the
rope
to
the
and
there
s
a
pension
attached
to
it
said
the
druggist
that
s
the
way
they
spend
the
people
s
money
goosefoot
spoke
up
in
defence
of
don
michele
saying
that
he
had
deserved
the
medal
and
the
pension
too
for
he
had
gone
into
the
water
up
to
his
knees
big
boots
and
all
to
save
the
malavoglia
three
persons
do
you
think
that
a
small
thing
three
lives
and
was
within
a
hair
of
losing
his
own
life
too
so
that
everybody
was
talking
of
him
and
on
a
sunday
when
he
put
on
his
new
uniform
the
girls
couldn
t
take
their
eyes
off
him
so
anxious
were
they
to
see
if
he
really
had
the
medal
or
barbara
zuppidda
now
that
she
s
got
rid
of
that
lout
of
a
malavoglia
won
t
turn
her
back
on
don
michele
any
more
said
goosefoot
i
ve
seen
her
with
her
nose
between
the
shutters
when
he
s
passed
along
the
ntoni
poor
fellow
as
long
as
they
couldn
t
do
without
him
had
run
hither
and
thither
indefatigably
and
had
been
in
despair
while
his
grandfather
was
so
now
that
he
was
better
he
took
to
lounging
about
with
his
arms
akimbo
waiting
till
it
was
time
to
take
the
to
master
to
be
mended
and
went
to
the
tavern
to
chat
with
the
others
though
he
hadn
t
a
sou
to
spend
there
and
told
to
this
one
and
that
one
how
near
he
had
been
to
drowning
and
so
passed
the
time
away
lounging
and
spitting
about
doing
nothing
when
any
one
would
pay
for
wine
for
him
he
would
get
angry
about
don
michele
and
say
he
had
taken
away
his
sweetheart
that
he
went
every
evening
to
talk
to
barbara
at
the
window
that
uncle
santoro
had
seen
him
that
he
had
asked
nunziata
if
she
hadn
t
seen
don
michele
pass
by
the
black
street
but
blood
of
judas
my
name
isn
t
ntoni
malavoglia
if
i
don
t
put
a
stop
to
that
blood
of
judas
it
amused
the
others
to
see
him
storm
and
fume
so
they
paid
for
him
to
drink
on
purpose
when
she
was
washing
the
glasses
turned
her
back
upon
them
so
as
not
to
hear
the
oaths
and
the
ugly
words
that
were
always
passing
among
them
but
hearing
don
michele
s
name
she
forgot
her
manners
and
listened
with
all
her
ears
she
also
became
curious
and
listened
to
them
with
open
mouth
and
gave
nunziata
s
little
brother
and
apples
or
green
almonds
to
get
out
of
them
what
had
passed
in
the
black
street
don
michele
swore
there
was
no
truth
in
the
story
and
often
in
the
evening
after
the
tavern
was
shut
they
might
be
still
heard
disputing
and
her
voice
would
be
audible
screaming
liar
assassin
miscreant
thief
and
other
pretty
names
so
much
so
that
don
michele
left
off
going
to
the
tavern
at
all
and
used
to
send
for
his
wine
instead
and
drink
it
by
himself
at
vanni
pizzuti
s
shop
xi
day
ntoni
malavoglia
lounging
about
as
usual
had
seen
two
young
men
who
had
embarked
some
years
before
at
riposto
in
search
of
fortune
and
had
returned
from
trieste
or
from
alexandria
in
short
from
afar
off
and
were
spending
and
swaggering
at
the
tavern
grander
than
cousin
naso
the
butcher
or
than
padron
cipolla
they
sat
astride
of
the
benches
joking
with
the
girls
and
pulling
innumerable
silk
handkerchiefs
out
of
their
pockets
turning
the
place
upsidedown
ntoni
when
he
came
home
at
night
found
nobody
there
but
the
women
who
were
changing
the
brine
on
the
anchovies
and
chatting
with
the
neighbors
sitting
in
a
circle
on
the
stones
and
passing
away
the
time
by
telling
stories
and
guessing
riddles
which
amused
greatly
the
children
who
stood
around
rubbing
their
sleepy
eyes
padron
ntoni
listened
too
and
watched
the
strainer
with
the
fresh
brine
nodding
his
head
in
approval
when
the
stories
pleased
him
or
when
the
boys
were
clever
at
guessing
the
riddles
the
best
story
of
all
said
ntoni
is
that
of
those
two
fellows
who
arrived
here
with
silk
kerchiefs
that
one
can
hardly
believe
one
s
eyes
to
look
at
and
such
a
lot
of
money
that
they
hardly
look
at
it
when
they
take
it
out
of
their
pockets
they
ve
seen
half
the
world
they
say
trezza
and
aci
castello
put
together
are
not
to
be
compared
to
what
they
ve
seen
i
ve
seen
the
world
too
and
how
people
in
those
parts
don
t
sit
still
salting
anchovies
but
go
round
amusing
themselves
all
day
long
and
the
women
with
silk
dresses
and
more
rings
and
necklaces
than
the
madonna
of
ognino
go
about
the
streets
vying
with
each
other
for
the
love
of
the
handsome
the
worst
of
all
things
said
mena
is
to
leave
one
s
own
home
where
even
the
stones
are
one
s
friends
and
when
one
s
heart
must
break
to
leave
them
behind
one
on
the
road
blest
is
the
bird
that
builds
his
nest
at
home
brava
sant
agata
said
her
grandfather
that
is
what
i
call
talking
yes
growled
ntoni
and
when
we
have
sweated
and
steamed
to
build
our
nest
we
haven
t
anything
left
to
eat
and
when
we
have
managed
to
get
back
the
house
by
the
medlar
we
shall
just
have
to
go
on
wearing
out
our
lives
from
monday
to
saturday
and
never
do
anything
and
don
t
you
mean
to
work
any
more
what
do
you
mean
to
do
turn
lawyer
i
don
t
mean
to
turn
lawyer
said
ntoni
and
went
off
to
bed
in
high
dudgeon
but
from
that
time
forth
he
thought
of
nothing
but
the
easy
wandering
life
other
fellows
led
and
in
the
evening
not
to
hear
all
that
idle
chatter
he
stood
by
the
door
with
his
shoulders
against
the
wall
watching
the
people
pass
and
meditating
on
his
hard
fate
at
least
one
was
resting
against
the
fatigues
of
when
must
begin
again
over
and
over
the
same
thing
like
cousin
mosca
s
ass
that
when
they
brought
the
collar
reached
out
his
neck
to
have
it
put
on
we
re
all
asses
he
muttered
that
s
what
we
are
asses
beasts
of
and
it
was
plainly
enough
to
be
seen
that
he
was
tired
of
that
hard
life
and
longed
to
leave
it
and
go
out
into
the
world
to
make
his
fortune
like
those
others
so
that
his
mother
poor
woman
was
always
stroking
him
on
the
shoulder
and
speaking
to
him
in
tones
that
were
each
like
a
caress
looking
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
tears
as
if
she
would
read
his
very
soul
but
he
told
her
there
was
no
cause
to
grieve
that
it
was
better
he
should
go
for
himself
and
for
the
rest
of
them
and
when
he
came
back
they
would
all
be
happy
together
the
poor
mother
never
closed
her
eyes
that
night
and
steeped
her
pillow
with
tears
at
last
the
grandfather
himself
perceived
it
and
called
his
grandson
outside
the
door
under
the
shrine
to
ask
him
what
ailed
him
what
is
it
my
boy
he
said
tell
your
grandpapa
do
that
s
a
good
ntoni
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
the
old
man
went
on
nodding
his
head
and
seeking
for
words
to
make
himself
understood
properly
yes
yes
you
ve
got
some
notion
in
your
head
boy
some
new
notion
or
other
who
goes
with
lame
men
limps
himself
before
i
m
a
poor
miserable
devil
that
s
what
it
well
is
that
all
you
knew
that
before
and
what
am
i
and
what
was
your
father
he
is
the
richest
who
has
the
fewest
wants
better
content
than
fine
consolation
that
is
this
time
the
old
man
found
words
for
they
were
in
his
heart
and
so
came
straight
to
his
lips
at
least
don
t
say
it
to
your
my
mother
she
would
have
done
better
not
to
have
brought
me
into
the
world
my
mother
yes
assented
padron
ntoni
it
would
have
been
better
she
had
not
borne
you
if
you
are
to
begin
to
talk
in
this
for
a
minute
ntoni
didn
t
know
what
to
say
then
he
began
well
i
mean
it
for
your
good
too
for
you
for
my
mother
for
us
all
i
want
to
make
her
rich
my
mother
that
s
what
i
want
now
we
re
tormenting
ourselves
for
the
house
and
for
mena
s
dowry
then
lia
will
grow
up
and
she
ll
want
a
dowry
too
and
then
a
bad
year
will
throw
us
all
back
into
misery
i
don
t
want
to
lead
this
life
any
longer
i
want
to
change
my
condition
and
to
change
yours
i
want
that
we
should
be
rich
mamma
mena
you
alessio
all
of
padron
ntoni
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
and
listened
pondering
to
this
discourse
which
he
found
very
hard
to
understand
rich
he
said
rich
and
what
shall
we
do
when
we
are
rich
ntoni
scratched
his
head
and
began
to
wonder
himself
what
he
should
do
in
such
a
case
we
should
do
what
other
people
do
he
said
go
and
live
in
town
and
do
nothing
and
eat
in
town
go
and
live
in
town
by
yourself
i
choose
to
die
where
i
was
born
and
thinking
of
the
house
where
he
was
born
which
was
no
longer
his
he
let
his
head
drop
on
his
breast
you
are
but
a
boy
you
don
t
know
what
it
is
he
said
you
don
t
know
you
don
t
know
when
you
can
no
longer
sleep
in
your
own
bed
or
see
the
light
come
in
through
your
own
window
you
ll
see
what
it
is
i
am
old
and
i
know
the
poor
old
man
coughed
as
if
he
would
suffocate
with
bent
shoulders
shaking
his
head
sadly
his
own
nest
every
bird
likes
look
at
those
swallows
do
you
see
them
they
have
always
made
their
nest
there
and
they
still
return
to
make
it
there
and
never
go
but
i
am
not
a
swallow
said
ntoni
i
am
neither
a
bird
nor
a
beast
i
don
t
want
to
live
like
a
dog
on
a
chain
or
like
cousin
alfio
s
ass
or
like
a
mule
in
a
mill
that
goes
round
and
round
turning
the
same
wheel
forever
i
don
t
want
to
die
of
hunger
in
a
corner
or
to
be
eaten
up
by
thank
god
rather
that
you
were
born
here
and
pray
that
you
may
not
come
to
die
far
from
the
stones
that
you
know
who
changes
the
old
for
the
new
changes
for
the
worse
all
you
are
afraid
of
work
are
afraid
of
poverty
i
who
have
neither
your
youth
nor
your
strength
fear
them
not
the
good
pilot
is
known
in
the
you
are
afraid
of
having
to
work
for
your
bread
that
is
what
ails
you
when
my
father
rest
his
soul
left
me
the
and
five
mouths
to
feed
i
was
younger
than
you
are
now
and
i
was
not
afraid
and
i
have
done
my
duty
without
grumbling
and
i
do
it
still
and
i
pray
god
to
help
me
to
do
it
as
long
as
i
live
as
your
father
did
and
your
brother
luca
blessed
be
their
souls
who
feared
not
to
go
and
die
where
duty
led
them
your
mother
too
has
done
hers
poor
little
woman
hidden
inside
four
walls
and
you
know
not
the
tears
she
has
shed
nor
how
many
she
sheds
now
because
you
want
to
go
and
leave
her
nor
how
in
the
morning
your
sister
finds
her
sheets
wet
with
tears
and
nevertheless
she
is
silent
and
does
not
talk
of
you
nor
of
the
hard
things
you
say
to
her
and
she
works
and
puts
together
her
provision
poor
busy
little
ant
that
she
is
and
she
has
never
done
anything
else
all
her
life
long
before
she
had
so
many
tears
to
shed
and
when
she
suckled
you
at
her
breast
and
before
you
could
go
alone
or
the
temptation
had
come
over
you
to
go
wandering
like
a
gypsy
about
the
the
end
of
it
was
that
ntoni
began
to
cry
like
a
child
for
at
bottom
the
boy
had
a
good
heart
but
the
next
day
it
began
all
over
again
in
the
morning
he
took
the
tackle
unwillingly
on
his
shoulder
and
went
off
to
sea
growling
just
like
cousin
alfio
s
ass
at
daybreak
i
have
to
stretch
out
my
neck
to
see
if
they
are
coming
to
load
after
they
had
thrown
the
net
he
left
alessio
to
move
the
oars
slowly
so
as
to
keep
the
boat
in
its
place
and
folding
his
arms
looked
out
into
the
distance
to
where
the
sea
ended
towards
those
great
cities
where
people
did
nothing
but
walk
about
and
amuse
themselves
or
thought
of
the
two
sailors
who
had
come
back
thence
and
had
now
for
some
time
been
gone
away
from
the
place
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
wander
about
the
world
from
one
town
to
another
spending
the
money
they
had
in
their
pockets
in
the
evening
when
all
the
tackle
was
put
away
they
let
him
wander
about
as
he
liked
like
a
houseless
dog
without
a
soldo
to
bless
himself
with
sooner
than
see
him
sit
there
as
sulky
as
a
bear
what
ails
you
ntoni
said
la
longa
looking
timidly
into
his
face
with
her
eyes
shining
with
tears
for
she
knew
well
enough
poor
woman
what
it
was
that
ailed
him
tell
me
tell
your
he
did
not
answer
or
answered
that
nothing
ailed
him
but
at
last
he
did
tell
her
that
his
grandfather
and
the
rest
of
them
wanted
to
work
him
to
death
and
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
wanted
to
go
away
and
seek
his
fortune
like
other
people
his
mother
listened
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
and
could
not
speak
in
reply
to
him
as
he
went
on
weeping
and
stamping
and
tearing
his
hair
the
poor
creature
longed
to
answer
him
and
to
throw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
beg
him
not
to
go
away
from
her
but
her
lips
trembled
so
that
she
could
not
utter
a
word
listen
she
said
at
last
you
may
go
if
you
will
do
it
but
you
won
t
find
me
here
when
you
come
back
for
i
am
old
now
and
weak
and
i
can
not
bear
this
new
ntoni
tried
to
comfort
her
saying
he
would
soon
come
back
with
plenty
of
money
and
that
they
would
all
be
happy
together
maruzza
shook
her
head
sadly
saying
that
no
no
he
would
not
find
her
when
he
came
back
i
feel
that
i
am
growing
old
she
said
i
am
growing
old
look
at
me
i
have
no
strength
now
to
weep
as
i
did
when
your
father
died
and
your
brother
if
i
go
to
the
washing
i
come
back
so
tired
that
i
can
hardly
move
it
was
never
so
before
no
my
son
i
am
not
what
i
was
once
when
i
had
your
father
and
your
brother
i
was
young
and
strong
the
heart
gets
tired
too
you
see
it
wears
away
little
by
little
like
old
linen
that
has
been
too
often
washed
i
have
no
courage
now
everything
frightens
me
i
feel
as
one
does
when
the
waves
come
over
his
head
when
he
is
out
at
sea
go
away
if
you
will
but
wait
until
i
am
at
she
was
weeping
but
she
did
not
know
it
she
seemed
to
have
before
her
eyes
once
more
her
husband
and
her
son
luca
as
she
had
seen
them
when
they
left
her
to
return
no
more
so
you
will
go
and
i
shall
see
you
no
more
she
said
to
him
the
house
grows
more
empty
every
day
and
when
that
poor
old
man
your
grandfather
is
gone
too
in
whose
hands
shall
i
leave
those
orphan
children
ah
mother
of
sorrows
she
clung
to
him
with
her
head
against
his
breast
as
if
her
boy
were
going
to
leave
her
then
and
there
and
stroked
his
shoulder
and
his
cheeks
with
her
trembling
hands
then
ntoni
could
resist
her
no
longer
and
began
to
kiss
her
and
to
whisper
gently
in
her
ear
no
no
i
won
t
go
if
you
say
i
must
not
look
at
me
don
t
talk
so
don
t
well
i
ll
go
on
working
like
cousin
mosca
s
ass
that
will
be
thrown
into
a
ditch
to
die
when
he
s
too
old
to
work
any
more
are
you
contented
now
don
t
cry
don
t
cry
any
more
look
at
my
grandfather
how
he
has
struggled
all
his
life
and
is
struggling
still
to
get
out
of
the
mud
and
he
will
go
on
so
it
is
our
and
do
you
think
that
everybody
hasn
t
troubles
of
their
own
every
hole
has
its
nail
new
or
old
they
never
look
at
padron
cipolla
how

to
run
here
and
to
watch
there

to
have
his
son
brasi
throwing
all
the
money

has
saved
and
scraped
into
vespa

for
his
vineyard

it
rains
and
uncle
crucifix
starving
himself
to
put
soldo
upon
soldo
and
always
at
law
with
this
one
or
with
that
and
do
you
think
those
two
foreign
sailors
that
you
saw
here
and
that
put
all
this
in
your
head
with
their
talk
of
strange
countries
do
you
think
they
haven
t
their
own
troubles
too
who
knows
if
they
found
their
mothers
alive
when
they
got
home
to
their
own
houses
and
as
for
us
when
we
have
bought
back
the
house
by
the
medlar
and
have
our
grain
in
the
hutch
and
our
beans
for
the
winter
and
when
mena
is
married
what
more
shall
we
want
when
i
am
under
the
sod
and
that
poor
old
man
is
dead
too
and
alessio
is
old
enough
to
earn
his
bread
go
wherever
you
like
but
then
you
won
t
want
to
go
i
can
tell
you
for
then
you
will
begin
to
know
what
we
feel
when
we
see
you
so
obstinate
and
so
determined
to
leave
us
all
even
when
we
do
not
speak
but
go
on
in
our
usual
way
then
you
will
not
find
it
in
your
heart
to
leave
the
place
where
you
were
born
where
the
very
stones
know
you
well
where
your
own
dead
will
lie
together
under
the
marble
in
the
church
which
is
worn
smooth
by
the
knees
of
those
who
have
prayed
so
long
before
our
mother
of
ntoni
from
that
day
forth
said
no
more
of
going
away
or
of
growing
rich
and
his
mother
watched
him
tenderly
as
a
bird
watches
her
young
when
she
saw
him
looking
sad
or
sitting
silently
on
the
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
the
poor
woman
was
truly
a
sad
sight
to
see
so
pale
was
she
so
thin
and
worn
and
when
her
work
was
over
she
too
sat
down
with
folded
hands
and
her
back
bent
as
badly
as
her
s
but
she
knew
not
that
she
herself
was
going
for
a
journey
that
journey
which
leads
to
the
long
rest
below
the
smooth
marble
in
the
church
and
that
she
must
leave
behind
her
all
those
she
loved
so
well
who
had
so
grown
into
her
heart
that
they
had
worn
it
all
away
piece
by
piece
now
one
and
now
another
at
catania
there
was
the
cholera
and
everybody
that
could
manage
it
ran
away
into
the
country
here
and
there
among
the
villages
and
towns
in
the
neighborhood
and
at
ognino
and
at
trezza
too
these
strangers
who
spent
so
much
money
were
a
real
providence
but
the
merchants
pulled
a
long
face
and
said
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
sell
even
a
dozen
barrels
of
anchovies
and
that
all
the
money
had
disappeared
on
account
of
the
cholera
and
don
t
people
eat
anchovies
any
more
asked
goosefoot
but
to
padron
ntoni
who
had
them
to
sell
they
said
that
now
there
was
the
cholera
people
were
afraid
to
eat
anchovies
and
all
that
kind
of
stuff
but
must
eat
macaroni
and
meat
and
so
it
was
best
to
let
things
go
at
the
best
price
one
could
get
that
hadn
t
been
counted
in
the
malavoglia
s
reckoning
hence
not
to
go
backward
crab
fashion
needs
must
that
la
longa
should
go
about
from
house
to
house
among
the
foreigners
selling
eggs
and
fresh
bread
and
so
on
while
the
men
were
out
at
sea
and
so
put
together
a
little
money
but
it
was
needful
to
be
very
careful
and
not
take
even
so
much
as
a
pinch
of
snuff
from
a
person
one
did
not
know
walking
on
the
road
one
must
go
exactly
in
the
middle
as
far
away
as
possible
from
the
walls
where
one
ran
the
risk
of
coming
across
all
sorts
of
horrors
and
one
must
never
sit
down
on
the
stones
or
on
the
wall
la
longa
once
coming
back
from
aci
gastello
with
her
basket
on
her
arm
felt
so
tired
that
her
legs
were
like
lead
under
her
and
she
could
hardly
move
so
she
yielded
to
temptation
and
rested
a
few
minutes
on
the
smooth
stones
under
the
shade
of
the
just
by
the
shrine
at
the
entrance
of
the
town
and
she
remembered
afterwards
though
she
did
not
notice
it
at
the
time
that
a
person
unknown
to
her
a
poor
man
who
seemed
also
very
weary
and
ill
had
been
sitting
there
a
moment
before
she
came
up
in
short
she
fell
ill
took
the
cholera
and
returned
home
pale
and
tottering
as
yellow
as
a
gilded
heart
among
the
votive
offerings
and
with
deep
black
lines
under
her
eyes
so
that
when
mena
who
was
alone
at
home
saw
her
she
began
to
cry
and
lia
ran
off
to
gather
rosemary
and
marshmallow
leaves
mena
trembled
like
a
leaf
while
she
was
making
up
the
bed
and
the
sick
woman
sitting
on
a
chair
with
pallid
face
and
sunken
eyes
kept
on
saying
it
is
nothing
don
t
be
frightened
as
soon
as
i
have
got
into
bed
it
will
pass
off
and
tried
to
help
them
herself
but
every
minute
she
grew
faint
and
had
to
sit
down
again
holy
virgin
stammered
mena
holy
virgin
and
the
men
out
at
sea
holy
virgin
help
us
and
lia
cried
with
all
her
might
when
padron
ntoni
came
back
with
his
grandsons
and
they
saw
the
door
half
shut
and
the
light
inside
the
shutters
they
tore
their
hair
maruzza
was
already
in
bed
and
her
eyes
seen
in
that
way
in
the
dusk
looked
hollow
and
dim
as
if
death
had
already
dimmed
their
light
and
her
lips
were
black
as
charcoal
at
that
time
neither
doctor
nor
apothecary
went
out
after
sunset
and
even
the
neighbors
barred
their
doors
and
stuck
pictures
of
saints
over
all
the
cracks
for
fear
of
the
cholera
so
cousin
maruzza
had
no
help
except
from
her
own
poor
people
who
rushed
about
the
house
as
if
they
had
been
crazy
watching
her
fading
away
before
their
eyes
in
her
bed
and
beat
their
heads
against
the
wall
in
their
despair
then
la
longa
seeing
that
all
hope
was
gone
begged
them
to
lay
upon
her
breast
the
lock
of
cotton
dipped
in
holy
oil
which
she
had
bought
at
easter
and
said
that
they
must
keep
the
light
burning
as
they
had
done
when
padron
ntoni
had
been
so
ill
that
they
thought
him
dying
and
wanted
them
all
to
stay
beside
her
bed
that
she
might
look
at
them
until
the
last
moment
with
those
wide
eyes
that
no
longer
seemed
to
see
lia
cried
in
a
way
and
the
others
white
as
the
wall
looked
in
each
other
s
faces
as
if
asking
for
help
where
no
help
was
and
held
their
hands
tight
over
their
breasts
that
they
might
not
break
out
into
loud
wailing
before
the
dying
woman
who
none
the
less
knew
all
that
they
felt
though
by
this
time
she
saw
them
no
longer
and
even
at
the
last
felt
the
pain
of
leaving
them
behind
she
called
them
one
by
one
by
name
in
a
weak
and
broken
voice
and
tried
to
lift
her
hand
to
bless
them
knowing
that
she
was
leaving
them
a
treasure
beyond
price
ntoni
she
repeated
ntoni
to
you
who
are
the
eldest
i
leave
these
orphans
and
hearing
her
speak
thus
while
she
was
still
alive
they
could
not
help
bursting
out
into
cries
and
sobs
so
they
passed
the
night
beside
the
bed
where
maruzza
now
lay
without
moving
until
the
candle
burned
down
in
the
socket
and
went
out
and
the
dawn
came
in
through
the
window
pale
like
the
corpse
which
lay
with
features
sharpened
like
a
knife
and
black
parched
lips
but
mena
never
wearied
of
kissing
those
cold
lips
and
speaking
as
if
the
dead
could
hear
ntoni
beat
his
breast
and
cried
o
mother
o
mother
and
you
have
gone
before
me
and
i
wanted
to
leave
you
and
alessio
never
will
forget
that
last
look
of
his
mother
with
her
white
hair
and
pinched
features
no
not
even
when
his
hair
has
grown
as
white
as
hers
at
dusk
they
came
to
take
la
longa
in
a
hurry
and
no
one
thought
of
making
any
visits
for
every
one
feared
for
their
life
and
even
don
giammaria
came
no
farther
than
the
threshold
whence
he
dispensed
the
holy
water
holding
his
tunic
about
his
knees
tight
lest
it
should
touch
anything
in
the
house
like
a
selfish
monk
as
he
was
said
the
apothecary
he
on
the
contrary
had
they
brought
him
a
prescription
from
the
doctor
would
have
given
it
them
would
even
have
opened
the
shop
at
night
for
the
purpose
for
he
was
not
afraid
of
the
cholera
and
said
besides
that
it
was
all
stuff
and
nonsense
to
say
that
the
cholera
could
be
thrown
about
the
streets
or
behind
the
doors
a
sign
that
he
spreads
the
cholera
himself
whispered
the
priest
for
that
reason
the
people
of
the
place
wanted
to
kill
the
apothecary
but
he
laughed
at
them
with
the
cackling
laugh
he
had
learned
of
don
silvestro
saying
kill
me
i
m
a
republican
if
it
were
one
of
those
fellows
in
the
government
now
i
might
find
some
use
in
doing
it
but
what
good
would
it
do
me
to
spread
the
cholera
but
the
malavoglia
were
left
alone
with
the
bed
whence
the
mother
had
been
carried
away
for
some
time
they
did
not
open
the
door
after
la
longa
had
been
taken
away
it
was
a
blessing
that
they
had
plenty
to
eat
in
the
house
beans
and
oil
and
charcoal
too
for
padron
ntoni
like
the
ants
had
made
his
provision
in
time
of
plenty
else
they
might
have
died
of
hunger
for
no
one
came
to
see
whether
they
were
alive
or
dead
then
little
by
little
they
began
to
put
their
black
neckerchiefs
on
and
to
go
out
into
the
street
like
snails
after
a
storm
still
pale
and
the
gossips
remaining
aloof
called
out
to
them
to
ask
how
it
had
happened
for
cousin
maruzza
had
been
one
of
the
first
to
go
and
when
don
michele
or
some
other
personage
who
took
the
king
s
pay
and
wore
a
cap
came
their
way
they
looked
at
him
with
scared
eyes
and
ran
into
the
house
there
was
great
misery
and
no
one
was
seen
in
the
street
not
even
a
hen
and
don
cirino
was
never
seen
anywhere
and
had
left
off
ringing
at
noon
and
at
the
ave
maria
for
he
too
ate
the
bread
of
the
commune
and
had
five
francs
a
month
as
parish
beadle
and
feared
for
his
life
for
was
not
he
a
government
official
and
now
don
michele
was
lord
of
the
whole
place
for
pizzuti
and
don
silvestro
and
the
rest
hid
in
their
burrows
like
rabbits
and
only
he
walked
up
and
down
before
the
zuppidda
s
closed
door
it
was
a
pity
that
nobody
saw
him
except
the
malavoglia
who
had
no
longer
anything
to
lose
and
so
sat
watching
whoever
passed
by
sitting
on
the
with
their
elbows
on
their
knees
don
michele
not
to
take
his
walk
for
nothing
looked
at
sant
agata
now
that
all
the
other
doors
were
shut
and
did
it
all
the
more
to
show
that
great
hulking
ntoni
that
he
wasn
t
afraid
of
anybody
not
he
and
besides
mena
pale
as
she
was
looked
a
real
sant
agata
and
the
little
sister
with
her
black
neckerchief
was
growing
up
a
very
pretty
girl
it
seemed
to
poor
mena
that
twenty
years
had
fallen
suddenly
on
her
shoulders
she
watched
lia
now
as
la
longa
had
watched
her
and
kept
her
always
close
at
her
side
and
had
all
the
cares
of
the
house
on
her
mind
she
had
grown
into
a
habit
of
remaining
alone
in
the
house
with
her
sister
while
the
men
were
at
sea
looking
from
time
to
time
at
that
empty
bed
when
she
had
nothing
to
do
she
sat
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
looking
at
the
empty
bed
and
then
she
felt
indeed
that
her
mother
had
left
her
and
when
she
heard
them
say
in
the
street
such
an
one
is
dead
or
such
another
she
thought
so
they
heard
la
longa
is
dead
la
longa
who
had
left
her
alone
with
that
poor
little
orphan
with
her
black
neckerchief
nunziata
or
their
cousin
anna
came
now
and
then
stepping
softly
and
with
sad
looks
and
saying
nothing
would
sit
down
with
her
on
the
with
hands
under
their
aprons
the
men
coming
back
from
the
fishing
stepped
quickly
along
looking
carefully
from
side
to
side
with
the
nets
on
their
shoulders
and
no
one
stopped
anywhere
not
even
the
carts
at
the
tavern
who
could
tell
where
cousin
alfio
s
cart
was
now
or
if
at
this
moment
he
might
not
lie
dying
of
cholera
behind
a
hedge
that
poor
fellow
who
had
no
one
belonging
to
him
sometimes
goosefoot
passed
looking
half
starved
glanced
about
him
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
his
shadow
or
uncle
crucifix
whose
riches
were
scattered
here
and
there
and
who
went
to
see
if
his
debtors
were
likely
to
die
and
to
cheat
him
out
of
his
money
the
sacrament
went
by
too
quickly
in
the
hands
of
don
giammaria
with
his
tunic
fastened
up
and
a
barefooted
boy
ringing
the
bell
before
him
for
don
cirino
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
that
bell
in
the
deserted
streets
where
no
one
passed
not
a
dog
and
even
don
franco
kept
his
door
half
shut
was
the
only
person
to
be
seen
day
or
night
was
la
locca
with
her
tangled
white
hair
who
went
to
sit
before
the
house
by
the
or
watched
for
the
boats
on
the
shore
even
the
cholera
would
have
none
of
her
poor
old
thing
the
strangers
had
flown
as
birds
do
at
the
approach
of
winter
and
no
one
came
to
buy
the
fish
so
that
every
one
said
after
the
cholera
comes
the
padron
ntoni
had
once
more
to
dip
into
the
money
put
away
for
the
house
and
day
by
day
it
melted
before
his
eyes
but
he
thought
of
nothing
save
that
maruzza
had
died
away
from
her
own
house
he
could
not
get
that
out
of
his
head
ntoni
too
shook
his
head
every
time
it
was
necessary
to
use
up
the
money
finally
when
the
cholera
was
at
an
end
and
there
only
remained
about
half
of
the
money
put
together
with
such
pains
and
trouble
he
began
to
complain
that
such
a
life
as
that
he
could
not
bear
eternally
saving
and
sparing
and
then
having
to
spend
for
bare
life
that
it
was
better
to
risk
something
once
for
all
to
get
out
of
this
eternal
worry
and
that
there
at
least
where
his
mother
had
died
in
the
midst
of
that
hideous
misery
he
would
stay
no
longer
don
t
you
remember
that
your
mother
recommended
mena
to
you
said
padron
ntoni
what
good
can
i
do
to
mena
by
staying
here
tell
me
mena
looked
at
him
timidly
but
with
eyes
like
her
mother
s
where
one
could
read
her
heart
but
she
dared
not
speak
only
once
clinging
to
the
jamb
of
the
door
she
found
courage
to
say
i
don
t
ask
for
help
if
only
you
ll
stay
with
us
now
that
i
haven
t
my
mother
i
feel
like
a
fish
out
of
water
i
don
t
care
about
anything
but
i
can
t
bear
the
idea
of
that
orphan
lia
who
will
be
left
without
anybody
if
you
go
away
like
nunziata
when
her
father
left
no
said
ntoni
no
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
if
i
stay
here
the
proverb
says
help
yourself
and
you
ll
be
when
i
have
made
something
worth
while
i
ll
come
back
and
we
ll
all
be
happy
lia
and
alessio
opened
their
large
round
eyes
and
seemed
quite
dazzled
by
this
prospect
but
the
old
man
let
his
head
fall
on
his
breast
now
you
have
neither
father
nor
mother
and
can
do
as
it
seems
best
to
you
he
said
at
last
while
i
live
i
will
care
for
these
children
and
when
i
die
the
lord
must
do
the
mena
seeing
that
ntoni
would
go
whether
or
not
put
his
clothes
in
order
as
his
mother
would
have
done
and
thought
how
over
there
in
strange
lands
her
brother
would
be
like
alfio
mosca
with
no
one
to
look
after
him
and
while
she
sewed
at
his
shirts
and
pieced
his
coats
her
head
ran
upon
days
gone
by
and
she
thought
of
all
that
had
passed
away
with
them
with
a
swelling
heart
i
can
not
pass
the
house
by
the
medlar
now
she
said
as
she
sat
by
her
grandfather
i
feel
such
a
lump
in
my
throat
that
i
am
almost
choking
thinking
of
all
that
has
happened
since
we
left
and
while
she
was
preparing
for
her
brother
s
departure
she
wept
as
if
she
were
to
see
him
no
more
at
last
when
everything
was
ready
the
grandpapa
called
his
boy
to
give
him
a
last
solemn
sermon
and
much
good
advice
as
to
what
he
was
to
do
when
he
was
alone
and
dependent
only
on
his
own
discretion
without
his
family
about
him
to
consult
or
to
condole
with
him
if
things
went
wrong
and
gave
him
some
money
too
in
case
of
need
and
his
own
pouch
lined
with
leather
since
now
he
was
old
he
should
not
need
it
any
more
the
children
seeing
their
brother
preparing
for
departure
followed
him
silently
about
the
house
hardly
daring
to
speak
to
him
feeling
as
if
he
had
already
become
a
stranger
just
so
my
father
went
away
said
nunziata
who
had
come
to
say
to
ntoni
and
stood
with
the
others
at
the
door
after
that
no
one
spoke
the
neighbors
came
one
by
one
to
take
leave
of
cousin
ntoni
and
then
stood
waiting
in
the
street
to
see
him
start
he
lingered
with
his
bundle
on
his
shoulder
and
his
shoes
in
his
hand
as
if
at
the
last
moment
his
heart
had
failed
him
he
looked
about
him
as
if
to
fix
everything
in
his
memory
and
his
face
was
as
deeply
moved
as
any
there
his
grandfather
took
his
stick
to
accompany
him
to
the
city
and
mena
went
off
into
a
corner
where
she
cried
silently
come
come
now
said
ntoni
i
m
not
going
away
forever
we
ll
say
i
m
going
for
a
soldier
then
after
kissing
mena
and
lia
and
taking
leave
of
the
gossips
he
started
to
go
and
mena
ran
after
him
with
open
arms
weeping
aloud
and
crying
out
what
will
mamma
say
what
will
mamma
say
as
if
her
mother
were
alive
and
could
know
what
was
taking
place
but
she
only
said
the
thing
which
dwelt
most
strongly
in
her
memory
when
ntoni
had
spoken
of
going
away
before
and
she
had
seen
her
mother
weep
and
used
to
find
her
pillow
in
the
morning
wet
with
tears
adieu
ntoni
alessio
called
after
him
taking
courage
now
he
was
gone
and
lia
began
to
scream
just
so
my
father
went
said
nunziata
who
had
stayed
behind
the
others
at
the
door
ntoni
turned
at
the
corner
of
the
black
street
with
his
eyes
full
of
tears
and
waved
his
hand
to
them
in
token
of
farewell
mena
then
closed
the
door
and
went
to
sit
down
in
a
corner
with
lia
who
continued
to
sob
and
cry
aloud
now
another
one
is
gone
away
from
the
house
she
repeated
if
we
had
been
in
the
house
by
the
medlar
it
would
seem
as
empty
as
a
mena
seeing
her
dear
ones
go
away
one
after
the
other
felt
indeed
like
a
fish
out
of
water
and
nunziata
lingering
there
beside
her
with
the
little
one
in
her
arms
still
went
on
saying
just
so
my
father
went
away
just
so
xii
ntoni
now
that
he
had
no
one
but
alessio
to
help
him
with
the
boat
had
to
hire
some
one
by
the
day
cousin
nunzio
perhaps
who
had
a
sick
wife
and
a
large
family
of
children
or
the
son
of
la
locca
who
came
whining
to
him
behind
the
door
that
his
mother
was
starving
and
that
his
uncle
crucifix
would
give
them
nothing
because
he
said
the
cholera
had
ruined
him
so
many
of
his
debtors
had
died
and
had
cheated
him
out
of
his
money
and
he
had
taken
the
cholera
himself
but
he
hadn
t
died
added
the
son
of
la
locca
and
shook
his
head
ruefully
now
we
might
have
plenty
to
live
on
i
and
my
mother
and
all
the
family
if
he
had
died
we
stayed
two
days
with
vespa
nursing
him
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
dying
every
minute
but
he
didn
t
die
after
however
the
money
that
the
malavoglia
gained
day
by
day
was
often
not
enough
to
pay
cousin
nunzio
or
the
son
of
la
locca
and
they
were
obliged
to
take
up
those
precious
coins
so
painfully
put
together
to
buy
back
the
house
by
the
every
time
mena
went
to
take
the
stocking
from
under
the
mattress
she
and
her
grandfather
sighed
la
locca
s
son
was
not
to
blame
poor
fellow
he
would
have
done
four
men
s
work
sooner
than
not
give
the
full
worth
of
his
wages
it
was
the
fish
that
would
not
let
themselves
be
caught
and
when
they
came
ruefully
home
empty
rowing
with
loosened
sails
he
said
to
padron
ntoni
give
me
wood
to
split
or
fagots
to
bind
i
will
work
until
midnight
if
you
say
so
as
i
did
with
my
uncle
i
don
t
want
to
steal
the
wages
from
so
padron
ntoni
after
having
thought
the
matter
over
carefully
consulted
mena
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
she
was
like
her
mother
and
she
was
the
only
one
left
for
him
to
consult
the
only
one
left
of
so
many
the
best
thing
was
to
sell
the
which
brought
in
nothing
and
only
ate
up
the
wages
of
cousin
nunzio
or
the
son
of
la
locca
to
no
purpose
and
the
money
put
aside
for
the
house
was
melting
away
little
by
little
the
was
old
and
always
needed
to
be
mended
every
now
and
then
to
keep
her
afloat
later
if
ntoni
came
back
and
brought
better
fortune
once
more
among
them
they
might
buy
a
new
boat
and
call
that
also
the
on
sunday
he
went
to
the
piazza
after
the
mass
to
speak
to
goosefoot
about
it
cousin
tino
shrugged
his
shoulders
shook
his
head
said
that
the
was
good
for
nothing
but
to
put
under
the
pot
and
talking
in
this
way
he
drew
him
down
to
the
shore
the
patches
he
said
could
be
seen
under
the
paint
like
some
women
he
knew
of
with
wrinkles
under
their
stays
and
went
on
kicking
her
in
the
hull
with
his
lame
foot
besides
the
trade
was
going
badly
rather
than
buy
everybody
was
trying
to
sell
their
boats
much
better
than
the
provvidenza
and
who
was
going
to
buy
her
padron
cipolla
didn
t
want
old
stuff
like
that
this
was
an
affair
for
uncle
crucifix
but
at
this
moment
uncle
crucifix
had
something
else
on
his
hands
with
that
vespa
who
was
tormenting
his
soul
out
running
after
all
the
marriageable
men
in
the
place
at
last
for
old
friendship
s
sake
he
agreed
to
go
and
speak
to
uncle
crucifix
about
it
if
he
found
him
in
a
good
humor
padron
ntoni
were
really
anxious
to
sell
the
for
an
old
song
for
after
all
he
goosefoot
could
make
uncle
crucifix
do
anything
he
liked
in
fact
when
he
did
speak
of
it
drawing
him
aside
towards
the
uncle
crucifix
replied
with
shrugs
and
frantic
shakings
of
his
head
till
he
looked
like
one
possessed
and
tried
to
slip
out
of
goosefoot
s
hands
cousin
tino
poor
man
did
his
best
caught
him
by
the
coat
and
held
him
by
force
shook
him
to
make
him
give
his
attention
put
his
arm
round
his
neck
and
whispered
in
his
ear
yes
you
are
an
ass
if
you
let
slip
such
a
chance
going
for
an
old
song
i
tell
you
padron
ntoni
sells
her
because
he
can
t
manage
her
any
longer
now
his
grandson
is
gone
but
you
could
put
her
into
the
hands
of
cousin
nunzio
or
of
your
own
nephew
who
are
dying
of
hunger
and
will
work
for
next
to
nothing
every
soldo
she
gains
will
come
into
your
pocket
i
tell
you
you
are
a
fool
the
boat
is
in
perfectly
good
condition
good
as
new
old
padron
ntoni
knew
very
well
what
he
was
about
when
he
had
her
built
this
is
a
real
ready
money
business
as
good
as
that
of
the
lupins
take
my
word
for
it
but
uncle
crucifix
wouldn
t
listen
to
him
almost
crying
with
his
yellow
uglier
than
ever
since
he
had
nearly
died
of
the
cholera
and
tried
to
get
away
even
to
the
point
of
leaving
his
jacket
in
uncle
tino
s
hands
i
don
t
care
about
it
said
he
i
don
t
care
about
anything
you
don
t
know
all
the
trouble
i
have
cousin
tino
everybody
wants
to
suck
my
blood
like
so
many
leeches
here
s
vanni
pizzuti
running
after
vespa
too
they
re
like
a
pack
of
why
don
t
you
marry
her
yourself
after
all
is
she
not
your
own
blood
she
and
her
field
it
will
not
be
another
mouth
to
feed
not
at
all
she
has
a
clever
pair
of
hands
of
her
own
she
is
well
worth
the
bread
she
eats
that
woman
you
ll
have
a
servant
without
wages
and
the
land
will
be
yours
listen
uncle
crucifix
you
ll
have
another
affair
here
as
good
as
that
of
the
padron
ntoni
meanwhile
waited
for
the
answer
before
pizzuti
s
shop
and
watched
the
two
who
were
discussing
his
affairs
like
a
soul
in
purgatory
now
it
seemed
as
if
everything
were
at
an
end
now
they
began
again
and
he
tried
to
guess
whether
or
no
uncle
crucifix
would
consent
to
the
bargain
goosefoot
came
and
told
him
how
much
he
had
been
able
to
obtain
for
him
then
went
back
to
uncle
crucifix
going
backward
and
forward
in
the
piazza
like
the
shuttle
in
the
loom
dragging
his
behind
him
until
he
had
succeeded
in
bringing
them
to
an
agreement
capital
he
said
to
padron
ntoni
then
to
uncle
crucifix
for
an
old
song
i
tell
you
and
in
this
way
he
managed
the
sale
of
all
the
tackle
which
of
course
was
no
longer
of
any
use
to
the
malavoglia
now
that
they
had
no
boat
but
it
seemed
to
padron
ntoni
that
they
took
away
his
very
heart
from
within
him
as
he
saw
them
carry
away
the
nets
the
baskets
the
oars
the
rope
everything
i
ll
manage
to
get
you
a
position
by
the
day
and
your
grandson
alessio
too
never
fear
said
goosefoot
to
padron
ntoni
but
you
mustn
t
expect
high
wages
you
know
strength
of
youth
and
wisdom
of
for
my
assistance
in
the
bargaining
i
trust
to
your
in
time
of
famine
one
eats
barley
bread
answered
padron
ntoni
necessity
has
no
that
s
right
that
s
right
i
understand
replied
goosefoot
and
away
he
went
in
good
earnest
to
speak
to
padron
cipolla
at
the
where
don
silvestro
had
at
last
succeeded
in
enticing
him
as
well
as
master
filippo
and
a
few
other
bigwigs
to
talk
over
the
affairs
of
the
commune
for
after
all
the
money
was
theirs
and
it
is
silly
not
to
take
one
s
proper
place
in
the
government
when
one
is
rich
and
pays
more
taxes
than
all
the
rest
put
together
you
who
are
rich
can
afford
a
bit
of
bread
to
that
poor
old
padron
ntoni
suggested
goosefoot
it
will
cost
you
nothing
to
take
him
on
by
the
day
him
and
his
grandson
alessio
you
know
that
he
understands
his
business
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
place
and
he
will
be
content
with
little
for
they
are
absolutely
without
bread
it
is
an
affair
worth
gold
to
you
padron
fortunato
it
is
padron
fortunato
caught
as
he
was
just
at
that
propitious
moment
could
not
refuse
but
after
higgling
and
screwing
over
the
price
for
now
that
the
times
were
so
bad
he
really
hadn
t
work
for
any
more
men
he
at
last
made
a
great
favor
of
taking
on
padron
ntoni
yes
i
ll
take
him
if
he
ll
come
and
speak
to
me
himself
will
you
believe
that
they
are
out
of
temper
because
i
broke
off
my
son
s
marriage
with
mena
a
fine
thing
i
should
have
made
of
it
and
to
be
angry
about
it
what
could
i
do
don
silvestro
master
filippo
goosefoot
himself
all
of
them
in
fact
hastened
to
say
that
padron
fortunato
was
quite
right
mena
meanwhile
did
not
even
put
her
nose
at
the
window
for
it
was
not
seemly
to
do
so
now
that
her
mother
was
dead
and
she
had
a
black
kerchief
on
her
head
and
besides
she
had
to
look
after
the
little
one
and
to
be
a
mother
to
her
and
she
had
no
one
to
help
her
in
the
housework
so
that
she
had
to
go
to
the
tank
to
wash
and
to
the
fountain
and
to
take
the
men
their
luncheon
when
they
were
at
work
on
land
so
that
she
was
not
sant
agata
any
longer
as
in
the
days
when
no
one
ever
saw
her
and
she
was
all
day
long
at
the
loom
in
these
days
she
had
but
little
time
for
the
loom
don
michele
since
the
day
when
the
zuppidda
had
given
him
such
a
talking
to
from
her
terrace
and
had
threatened
to
put
out
his
eyes
with
her
distaff
never
failed
to
pass
by
the
black
street
and
sometimes
he
passed
two
or
three
times
a
day
looking
after
barbara
because
he
wasn
t
going
to
have
people
say
that
he
was
afraid
of
the
zuppidda
or
of
her
distaff
and
when
he
passed
the
house
where
the
malavoglia
lived
he
slackened
his
pace
and
looked
in
to
see
the
pretty
girls
who
were
growing
up
at
the
malavoglia
s
in
the
evening
when
the
men
came
back
from
sea
they
found
everything
ready
for
them
the
pot
boiling
on
the
fire
the
cloth
ready
on
the
table
that
table
that
was
so
large
for
them
now
that
they
were
so
few
that
they
felt
lost
at
it
they
shut
the
door
and
ate
their
supper
in
peace
then
they
sat
down
on
the
to
rest
after
the
fatigues
of
the
day
at
all
events
they
had
enough
for
the
day
s
needs
and
were
not
obliged
to
touch
the
money
that
was
accumulating
for
the
house
ntoni
had
always
that
house
in
his
mind
with
its
closed
windows
and
the
rising
above
the
wall
maruzza
had
not
been
able
to
die
in
that
house
nor
perhaps
should
he
die
there
but
the
money
was
beginning
to
grow
again
and
his
boys
at
least
would
go
back
there
some
day
or
other
now
that
alessio
was
growing
into
a
man
and
was
a
good
boy
and
one
of
the
true
malavoglia
stamp
when
they
had
bought
back
the
house
and
married
the
girls
if
they
might
get
a
boat
again
they
would
have
nothing
more
to
wish
for
and
padron
ntoni
might
close
his
eyes
in
peace
nunziata
and
anna
their
cousin
came
to
sit
on
the
stones
with
them
in
the
evenings
to
talk
over
old
times
for
they
too
were
left
lonely
and
desolate
so
that
they
seemed
like
one
family
felt
as
if
she
were
at
home
in
the
house
and
came
with
her
brood
running
after
her
like
a
hen
with
her
chickens
alessio
sitting
down
by
her
would
say
did
you
finish
your
linen
or
are
you
going
on
monday
to
master
filippo
to
help
with
the
vintage
now
that
the
olive
harvest
is
coming
you
ll
always
find
a
day
s
work
somewhere
even
when
you
haven
t
any
washing
to
do
and
you
can
take
your
brother
too
they
ll
give
him
two
soldi
a
nunziata
talked
to
him
gravely
and
asked
his
advice
with
regard
to
her
plans
and
they
talked
apart
together
as
if
they
had
already
been
a
old
couple
they
have
grown
wise
in
their
youth
because
they
have
had
so
much
trouble
said
padron
ntoni
wisdom
comes
of
alessio
with
his
arms
round
his
knees
like
his
grandfather
asked
nunziata
will
you
have
me
for
a
husband
when
i
grow
up
plenty
of
time
yet
to
think
about
that
replied
she
yes
there
s
time
but
one
must
begin
to
think
about
it
now
so
that
one
may
settle
what
is
to
be
done
first
of
course
we
must
marry
mena
and
lia
when
she
is
grown
up
lia
wants
to
be
dressed
like
a
woman
now
and
you
have
your
boys
to
find
places
for
we
must
buy
a
boat
first
the
boat
will
help
us
to
buy
the
house
grandfather
wants
to
buy
back
the
house
by
the
medlar
and
i
should
like
that
best
too
for
i
know
my
way
all
about
it
even
in
the
dark
without
running
against
anything
and
the
court
is
large
so
that
there
s
plenty
of
room
for
the
tackle
and
in
two
minutes
one
is
at
the
sea
then
when
my
sisters
are
married
grandfather
can
stay
with
us
and
we
ll
put
him
in
the
big
room
that
opens
on
the
court
where
the
sun
comes
in
so
when
he
isn
t
able
to
go
to
sea
any
longer
poor
old
man
he
can
sit
by
the
door
in
the
court
and
in
the
summer
the
will
make
a
shade
for
him
we
ll
take
the
room
on
the
garden
you
ll
like
that
the
kitchen
is
close
by
so
you
ll
have
everything
under
your
hand
won
t
you
when
my
brother
ntoni
comes
back
we
ll
give
him
that
room
and
we
ll
take
the
one
there
are
only
the
steps
to
climb
to
reach
the
kitchen
and
the
in
the
kitchen
there
must
be
a
new
hearth
said
nunziata
the
last
time
we
cooked
anything
there
when
poor
cousin
maruzza
was
too
unhappy
to
do
it
herself
we
had
to
prop
up
the
pot
with
yes
i
remember
said
alessio
sitting
with
his
chin
in
his
hands
and
nodding
gravely
with
wide
dreamy
eyes
as
if
he
saw
nunziata
at
the
fire
and
his
poor
mother
weeping
beside
the
bed
and
you
too
said
he
can
find
your
way
in
the
dark
about
the
house
by
the
medlar
you
have
been
there
so
often
mamma
always
said
you
were
a
good
now
they
have
sown
onions
in
the
garden
and
they
re
grown
as
big
as
do
you
like
onions
i
must
i
have
no
choice
they
help
the
bread
down
and
they
are
cheap
when
we
haven
t
money
enough
to
buy
macaroni
we
always
eat
them
i
and
my
little
for
that
they
sell
so
well
uncle
crucifix
doesn
t
care
about
planting
cabbages
or
lettuce
at
the
house
by
the
medlar
because
he
has
them
at
his
own
house
and
so
he
puts
nothing
there
but
onions
but
we
ll
plant
broccoli
and
cauliflower
won
t
they
be
good
eh
the
girl
with
her
arms
across
her
knees
curled
upon
the
threshold
looked
out
with
dreaming
eyes
as
well
as
the
boy
then
after
a
while
she
began
to
sing
and
alessio
listened
with
all
his
ears
at
last
she
said
there
s
plenty
of
time
yes
assented
alessio
first
we
must
marry
mena
and
lia
and
we
must
find
places
for
the
boys
but
we
must
begin
to
talk
it
over
when
nunziata
sings
said
mena
coming
to
the
door
it
is
a
sign
that
it
will
be
fair
weather
and
we
can
go
to
cousin
anna
was
in
the
same
mind
for
her
field
and
vineyard
was
the
and
her
were
those
on
which
she
had
her
hands
full
of
clothes
to
be
washed
all
the
more
now
that
her
son
rocco
was
feasting
himself
every
day
after
his
fashion
at
the
tavern
trying
to
drown
his
regret
for
the
mangiacarubbe
who
had
thrown
him
over
for
brasi
cipolla
like
a
coquette
as
she
was
it
s
a
long
lane
that
has
no
turning
said
padron
ntoni
perhaps
this
may
bring
your
son
rocco
to
his
senses
and
it
will
be
good
for
my
ntoni
too
to
be
away
from
home
for
a
while
for
when
he
comes
back
and
is
tired
of
wandering
about
the
world
everything
will
seem
as
it
should
be
and
he
will
not
complain
any
more
and
if
we
succeed
in
once
more
putting
our
own
boat
at
sea
and
it
s
putting
our
own
beds
in
the
old
places
that
we
know
so
well
you
will
see
what
pleasant
times
we
shall
have
resting
on
the
there
when
we
are
tired
after
our
day
s
work
when
the
day
has
been
a
good
one
and
how
bright
the
light
will
look
in
that
room
where
you
have
seen
it
so
often
and
have
known
all
the
faces
that
were
dearest
to
you
on
earth
but
now
so
many
are
gone
and
never
have
come
back
that
it
seems
as
if
the
room
would
be
always
dark
and
the
door
shut
as
if
those
who
are
gone
had
taken
the
key
with
them
forever
ntoni
should
not
have
gone
away
added
the
old
man
after
a
long
silence
he
knew
that
i
was
old
and
that
when
i
am
gone
the
children
will
have
no
one
if
we
buy
the
house
by
the
medlar
while
he
is
gone
said
mena
he
won
t
know
it
and
will
come
here
to
find
padron
ntoni
shook
his
head
sadly
but
there
s
time
enough
yet
he
said
at
last
like
and
cousin
anna
added
if
ntoni
comes
back
rich
he
can
buy
the
padron
ntoni
answered
nothing
but
the
whole
place
knew
that
ntoni
would
come
back
rich
now
he
had
been
gone
so
long
in
search
of
fortune
and
many
envied
him
already
and
wanted
to
go
in
search
of
fortune
too
like
him
in
fact
they
were
not
far
wrong
they
would
only
leave
a
few
women
to
fret
after
them
and
the
only
ones
who
hadn
t
the
heart
to
leave
their
women
were
that
stupid
son
of
la
locca
whose
mother
was
what
everybody
knew
she
was
and
rocco
spatu
whose
soul
was
at
the
tavern
fortunately
for
the
women
padron
ntoni
s
ntoni
was
suddenly
discovered
to
have
come
back
by
night
in
a
bark
from
catania
ashamed
to
show
himself
as
he
had
no
shoes
if
it
were
true
that
he
had
come
back
rich
he
had
nowhere
to
put
his
money
for
his
clothes
were
all
rags
and
tatters
but
his
family
received
him
as
affectionately
as
if
he
had
come
back
loaded
with
gold
his
sisters
hung
round
his
neck
crying
and
laughing
for
joy
and
ntoni
did
not
know
lia
again
so
tall
she
was
and
they
all
said
to
him
now
you
won
t
leave
us
again
will
you
the
grandfather
blew
his
nose
and
growled
now
i
can
die
in
peace
now
that
these
children
will
not
be
left
alone
in
the
but
for
a
whole
week
ntoni
never
showed
himself
in
the
street
every
one
laughed
when
they
saw
him
and
goosefoot
went
about
saying
have
you
seen
the
grand
fortune
that
padron
ntoni
s
ntoni
has
brought
home
and
those
who
had
not
been
in
such
a
terrible
hurry
to
make
up
their
bundles
of
shirts
and
stockings
to
leave
their
homes
like
a
lot
of
fools
could
not
contain
themselves
for
laughing
whoever
goes
in
search
of
fortune
and
does
not
find
it
is
a
fool
everybody
knows
that
don
silvestro
uncle
crucifix
padron
cipolla
master
filippo
were
not
fools
and
everybody
did
their
best
to
please
them
because
poor
people
always
stand
with
their
mouths
open
staring
at
the
rich
and
fortunate
and
work
for
them
like
cousin
mosca
s
ass
instead
of
kicking
the
cart
to
pieces
and
running
off
to
roll
on
the
grass
with
heels
in
the
air
the
druggist
was
quite
right
when
he
said
that
it
was
high
time
to
kick
the
world
to
pieces
and
make
it
over
again
and
he
himself
with
his
big
beard
and
his
fine
talk
about
making
the
world
over
again
was
one
of
those
who
had
known
how
to
make
a
fortune
and
to
hold
on
to
it
too
and
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
stand
at
his
door
and
chat
with
this
one
and
that
one
for
when
he
had
done
pounding
that
little
bit
of
dirty
water
in
his
mortar
his
work
was
finished
for
the
day
that
fine
trade
he
had
learned
of
his
father
to
make
money
out
of
the
water
in
the
cistern
but
ntoni
s
grandfather
had
taught
him
a
trade
which
was
nothing
but
breaking
one
s
arms
and
one
s
back
all
day
long
and
risking
one
s
life
and
dying
of
hunger
and
never
having
a
day
to
one
s
self
when
one
could
lie
on
the
grass
in
the
sun
as
even
mosca
s
ass
could
sometimes
do
a
real
thieves
trade
that
wore
one
s
soul
out
by
our
lady
and
he
for
one
was
tired
of
it
and
would
rather
be
like
rocco
spatu
who
at
least
didn
t
work
and
for
that
matter
he
cared
nothing
for
barbara
nor
sara
nor
any
other
girl
in
the
world
they
care
for
nothing
but
fishing
for
husbands
to
work
worse
than
dogs
to
give
them
their
living
and
buy
silk
handkerchiefs
for
them
to
wear
when
they
stand
at
their
doors
of
a
sunday
with
their
hands
on
their
full
stomachs
he
d
rather
stand
there
himself
sunday
and
monday
too
and
all
the
other
days
in
the
week
since
there
was
no
good
in
working
all
the
time
for
nothing
so
ntoni
had
learned
to
spout
as
well
as
the
druggist
that
much
at
least
he
had
brought
back
from
abroad
for
now
his
eyes
were
open
like
a
kitten
s
when
it
is
nine
days
old
the
hen
that
goes
in
the
street
comes
home
with
a
full
if
he
hadn
t
filled
his
crop
with
anything
else
he
had
filled
it
with
wisdom
and
he
went
about
telling
all
he
had
learned
in
the
piazza
in
pizzuti
s
shop
and
also
at
santuzza
s
tavern
now
he
went
openly
to
the
tavern
for
after
all
he
was
grown
up
and
his
grandfather
wasn
t
likely
to
come
there
after
him
and
pull
his
ears
and
he
should
know
very
well
what
to
say
to
anybody
who
tried
to
hinder
him
from
going
there
after
the
little
pleasure
that
there
was
to
be
had
his
grandfather
poor
man
instead
of
pulling
his
ears
tried
to
touch
his
feelings
see
he
said
now
you
have
come
we
shall
soon
be
able
to
manage
to
get
back
the
always
that
same
old
song
about
the
house
uncle
crucifix
has
promised
not
to
sell
it
to
any
one
else
your
mother
poor
dear
was
not
able
to
die
there
we
can
get
the
dowry
for
mena
on
the
house
then
with
god
s
help
we
can
set
up
another
boat
because
i
must
tell
you
that
at
my
age
it
is
hard
to
go
out
by
the
day
and
obey
other
people
when
one
has
been
used
to
command
you
were
also
born
of
masters
would
you
rather
that
we
should
buy
the
boat
first
with
the
money
instead
of
the
house
now
you
are
grown
up
and
can
have
your
choice
because
you
have
seen
more
of
the
world
and
should
be
wiser
than
i
am
now
i
am
old
what
would
you
rather
do
he
would
rather
do
nothing
that
s
what
he
would
rather
do
what
did
he
care
about
the
boat
or
the
house
then
there
would
come
another
bad
year
another
cholera
some
other
misfortune
and
eat
up
the
boat
and
the
house
and
they
would
have
to
begin
all
over
again
like
the
ants
a
fine
thing
and
when
they
had
got
the
boat
and
the
house
could
they
leave
off
working
or
could
they
eat
meat
and
macaroni
every
day
while
instead
down
there
where
he
had
been
there
were
people
that
went
about
in
carriages
everyday
that
s
what
they
did
people
beside
whom
don
franco
and
the
were
themselves
no
better
than
beasts
of
burden
working
as
they
did
all
day
long
spoiling
paper
and
beating
dirty
water
in
a
mortar
at
least
he
wanted
to
know
why
there
should
be
people
in
the
world
who
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
enjoy
themselves
and
were
born
with
silver
spoons
in
their
mouths
and
others
who
had
nothing
and
must
drag
a
cart
with
their
teeth
all
their
lives
besides
which
that
idea
of
going
out
by
the
day
was
not
at
all
to
his
taste
he
was
born
a
master
his
grandfather
had
said
so
himself
he
to
be
ordered
about
by
a
lot
of
people
who
had
risen
from
nothing
who
as
everybody
in
the
place
knew
had
put
their
money
together
soldo
after
soldo
sweating
and
struggling
he
had
gone
out
by
the
day
only
because
his
grandfather
took
him
and
he
hadn
t
strength
of
mind
to
refuse
but
when
the
overseer
stood
over
him
like
a
dog
and
called
out
from
the
stern
now
then
boy
what
are
you
at
he
felt
tempted
to
hit
him
over
the
head
with
the
oar
and
he
preferred
to
weave
baskets
or
to
mend
nets
sitting
on
the
beach
with
his
back
against
a
stone
for
then
if
he
folded
his
arms
for
a
minute
nobody
called
out
at
him
thither
came
also
rocco
spatu
to
yawn
and
stretch
his
arms
and
vanni
pizzuti
between
one
customer
and
another
in
his
idle
moments
and
goosefoot
came
there
too
for
his
business
was
to
mix
himself
up
with
every
conversation
that
he
could
find
in
search
of
bargaining
and
they
talked
of
all
that
happened
in
the
place
senserie
a
sort
of
very
small
brokerage
upon
which
a
tiny
percentage
is
paid
from
one
thing
to
another
they
got
talking
of
uncle
crucifix
who
had
they
said
lost
more
than
thirty
scudi
through
people
that
had
died
of
the
cholera
and
had
left
pledges
in
his
hands
now
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
all
these
and
that
had
remained
on
his
hands
had
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
vespa
the
thing
was
certain
they
had
been
seen
to
go
together
to
write
themselves
up
at
the
municipality
in
don
silvestro
s
presence
it
is
not
true
that
he
is
marrying
on
account
of
the
jewellery
said
goosefoot
who
was
in
a
position
to
know
the
things
are
of
gold
or
of
silver
and
he
could
go
and
sell
them
by
weight
in
the
city
he
would
have
got
back
a
good
percentage
on
the
money
he
had
lent
on
them
he
marries
vespa
because
she
took
him
to
the
municipality
to
show
him
the
paper
that
she
had
had
drawn
up
ready
to
be
signed
before
the
notary
with
cousin
spatu
here
now
that
the
mangiacarubbe
has
dropped
him
for
brasi
cipolla
excuse
me

ntoni
they
re
all
and
continued
goosefoot
uncle
crucifix
ran
off
panting
to
the
notary
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
so
he
had
to
take
the
wasp
after
here
the
apothecary
who
had
come
down
to
the
beach
to
smoke
his
pipe
joined
in
the
conversation
and
went
on
pounding
in
his
usual
way
upon
his
usual
theme
that
the
world
ought
to
be
put
in
a
mortar
and
pounded
to
pieces
and
made
all
over
again
but
this
time
he
really
might
as
well
have
pounded
dirty
water
in
his
mortar
for
not
one
of
them
understood
a
word
he
said
unless
perhaps
it
were
ntoni
he
at
least
had
seen
the
world
and
opened
his
eyes
like
the
kittens
when
he
was
a
soldier
they
had
taught
him
to
read
and
for
that
reason
he
too
went
to
the
door
and
listened
when
the
newspaper
was
read
and
stayed
to
talk
with
the
druggist
who
was
a
fellow
and
did
not
give
himself
airs
like
his
wife
who
kept
calling
out
to
him
why
will
you
mix
yourself
up
with
what
doesn
t
concern
you
one
must
let
the
women
talk
and
manage
things
quietly
said
don
franco
as
soon
as
his
wife
was
safe
he
didn
t
mind
taking
counsel
even
with
those
who
went
barefoot
provided
they
didn
t
put
their
feet
on
the
chairs
and
explained
to
them
word
for
word
all
that
there
was
printed
in
the
newspaper
following
it
with
his
finger
telling
them
that
the
world
ought
to
go
as
it
was
written
down
there
xiii
ntoni
when
his
grandson
came
home
to
him
drunk
in
the
evening
did
his
best
to
get
him
off
to
bed
without
letting
him
be
seen
by
the
others
because
such
a
thing
had
never
been
known
among
the
malavoglia
and
old
as
he
was
it
brought
the
tears
to
his
eyes
when
he
got
up
by
night
to
call
alessio
to
go
out
to
sea
he
let
the
other
one
sleep
for
that
matter
he
wouldn
t
have
been
of
any
use
if
he
had
gone
at
first
ntoni
was
ashamed
of
himself
and
went
down
to
the
landing
to
meet
them
with
bent
head
but
little
by
little
he
grew
hardened
and
said
to
himself
so
i
shall
have
another
sunday
too
the
poor
old
man
did
everything
he
could
think
of
to
touch
his
heart
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
take
a
shirt
of
his
to
don
giammaria
to
be
exorcised
which
cost
him
thirty
centimes
see
he
said
to
ntoni
such
things
were
never
known
among
the
malavoglia
if
you
take
the
downward
road
like
rocco
spatu
your
brother
and
your
sister
will
go
after
you
one
black
sheep
spoils
the
and
those
few
pence
which
we
have
put
together
with
such
pains
will
all
go
again
for
one
fisherman
the
boat
was
lost
and
what
shall
we
do
then
ntoni
stood
with
his
head
down
or
growled
something
between
his
teeth
but
the
next
day
it
was
the
same
thing
over
again
and
once
he
said
at
least
if
i
lose
my
head
i
forget
my
what
do
you
mean
by
misery
you
are
young
you
are
healthy
you
understand
your
business
what
do
you
want
more
i
am
old
your
brother
is
but
a
boy
but
we
have
pulled
ourselves
out
of
the
ditch
now
if
you
would
help
us
we
might
become
once
more
what
we
were
in
other
days
not
happy
as
we
were
then
for
the
dead
can
not
return
to
us
but
without
other
troubles
and
we
should
be
together
like
the
fingers
of
a
hand
and
should
have
bread
to
eat
if
i
close
my
eyes
once
for
all
what
is
to
become
of
you
see
now
i
tremble
every
time
we
put
out
to
sea
lest
i
should
never
come
back
and
i
am
old
when
his
grandfather
succeeded
in
touching
his
heart
ntoni
would
begin
to
cry
his
brother
and
sisters
who
knew
all
would
run
away
and
shut
themselves
up
almost
as
if
he
were
a
stranger
or
as
if
they
were
afraid
of
him
and
his
grandfather
with
his
rosary
in
his
hand
muttered
o
blessed
soul
of
bastianazzo
o
soul
of
my
maruzza
pray
that
a
miracle
may
be
worked
for
when
mena
saw
him
coming
with
pale
face
and
shining
eyes
she
met
him
saying
come
this
way
grandfather
is
in
there
and
brought
him
in
through
the
little
door
of
the
kitchen
then
sat
down
and
cried
quietly
by
the
hearth
so
that
at
last
one
evening
ntoni
said
i
won
t
go
to
the
tavern
again
no
not
if
they
kill
me
and
went
back
to
his
work
with
all
his
former
nay
he
even
got
up
earlier
than
the
rest
and
went
down
to
the
beach
to
wait
for
them
while
it
wanted
still
two
hours
to
day
the
three
kings
were
shining
over
the
and
the
crickets
could
be
heard
trilling
in
the
vineyards
as
if
they
had
been
close
by
the
grandpapa
could
not
contain
himself
for
joy
he
went
on
all
the
time
talking
to
him
to
show
how
pleased
he
was
and
said
to
himself
it
is
the
blessed
souls
of
his
father
and
his
mother
that
have
worked
this
the
miracle
lasted
all
the
week
and
when
sunday
came
ntoni
wouldn
t
even
go
into
the
piazza
lest
he
should
see
the
tavern
even
from
a
distance
or
meet
his
friends
who
might
call
him
but
he
dislocated
his
jaws
yawning
all
that
long
day
when
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
he
wasn
t
a
child
to
go
about
among
the
bushes
on
the
down
singing
like
nunziata
and
his
brother
alessio
or
a
girl
to
sweep
the
house
like
mena
nor
was
he
an
old
man
to
spend
the
day
mending
broken
barrels
or
baskets
like
his
grandfather
he
sat
by
the
door
in
the
little
street
where
not
even
a
hen
passed
by
the
door
and
listened
to
the
voices
and
the
laughter
at
the
tavern
he
went
to
bed
early
to
pass
the
time
and
got
up
on
monday
morning
sulky
as
ever
his
grandfather
said
to
him
it
would
be
better
for
you
if
sunday
never
came
for
the
day
after
you
are
just
as
if
you
were
that
was
what
would
be
best
for
him
that
there
should
not
even
be
sunday
to
rest
in
and
his
heart
sank
to
think
that
every
day
should
be
like
monday
so
that
when
he
came
back
from
the
fishing
in
the
evening
he
would
not
even
go
to
bed
but
went
about
here
and
there
bemoaning
his
hard
fate
and
ended
by
going
back
to
the
tavern
at
first
when
he
used
to
come
home
uncertain
of
his
footing
he
slipped
in
quietly
and
stammered
excuses
or
went
silently
to
bed
but
now
he
was
noisy
and
disputed
with
his
sister
who
met
him
at
the
door
with
a
pale
face
and
red
eyes
and
told
him
to
come
in
by
the
back
way
for
that
grandfather
was
there
i
don
t
care
he
replied
the
next
day
he
got
up
looking
wretchedly
ill
and
in
a
very
bad
humor
and
took
to
scolding
and
swearing
all
day
long
once
there
was
a
very
sad
scene
his
grandfather
not
knowing
what
to
do
to
touch
his
heart
drew
him
into
the
corner
of
the
little
room
with
the
doors
shut
that
the
neighbors
might
not
hear
and
said
to
him
crying
like
a
child
the
poor
old
man
oh
ntoni
don
t
you
remember
that
here
your
mother
died
why
should
you
disgrace
your
mother
turning
out
as
badly
as
rocco
spatu
don
t
you
see
how
poor
cousin
anna
works
all
the
time
for
that
big
drunkard
of
a
son
of
hers
and
how
she
weeps
at
times
because
she
has
not
bread
to
give
to
her
other
children
and
has
no
longer
the
heart
to
laugh
who
goes
with
wolves
turns
wolf
and
who
goes
with
cripples
one
year
goes
lame
the
don
t
you
remember
that
night
of
the
cholera
that
we
were
all
gathered
around
that
bed
and
she
confided
the
children
to
your
care
ntoni
cried
like
a
weaned
calf
and
said
he
wished
he
could
die
too
but
afterwards
he
went
back
slowly
indeed
and
as
if
unwillingly
but
still
he
did
go
back
to
the
tavern
and
at
night
instead
of
coming
home
he
wandered
about
the
streets
and
leaned
against
the
walls
half
dead
with
fatigue
with
rocco
spatu
and
cinghialenta
or
he
sang
and
shouted
with
them
to
drive
away
his
melancholy
at
last
poor
old
padron
ntoni
got
so
that
he
was
ashamed
to
show
himself
in
the
street
his
grandson
instead
to
get
rid
of
his
sermons
came
home
looking
so
black
that
nobody
felt
inclined
to
speak
to
him
as
if
he
didn
t
preach
plenty
of
sermons
to
himself
but
it
was
all
the
fault
of
his
fate
that
he
had
been
born
in
such
a
state
of
life
and
he
went
off
to
the
druggist
or
to
whoever
else
would
listen
to
him
to
exhaust
himself
in
speeches
about
the
injustice
of
everything
that
there
was
in
this
world
that
if
a
poor
fellow
went
to
santuzza
s
to
drink
and
forget
his
troubles
he
was
called
a
drunkard
while
those
who
drank
their
own
wine
at
home
had
no
troubles
nor
any
one
to
reprove
them
or
hunt
them
off
to
work
but
were
rich
enough
for
two
and
did
not
need
to
work
while
we
were
all
the
sons
of
god
and
everybody
ought
to
share
and
share
alike
that
fellow
has
talent
said
the
druggist
to
don
silvestro
or
padron
cipolla
or
to
anybody
else
whom
he
could
find
he
sees
things
in
the
lump
but
an
idea
he
has
it
isn
t
his
fault
if
he
doesn
t
express
himself
properly
but
that
of
the
government
that
leaves
him
in
for
his
instruction
he
lent
him
the
the
and
the
of
but
ntoni
very
soon
got
tired
of
reading
first
because
it
was
troublesome
and
because
while
he
was
a
soldier
they
had
made
him
learn
to
read
by
force
but
now
he
was
at
liberty
to
do
as
he
liked
and
besides
he
had
forgotten
a
good
deal
of
it
and
how
the
words
came
one
after
another
in
printing
and
all
that
talk
in
print
didn
t
put
a
penny
in
his
pocket
what
did
it
matter
to
him
don
franco
explained
to
him
how
it
mattered
to
him
and
when
don
michele
passed
across
the
piazza
he
shook
his
head
at
him
winking
and
pointed
out
to
him
how
he
came
after
donna
rosolina
as
well
as
others
for
donna
rosolina
had
money
and
gave
it
to
people
to
get
herself
married
first
we
must
clear
away
all
these
fellows
in
uniform
we
must
make
a
revolution
that
s
what
we
must
and
what
will
you
give
me
to
make
the
revolution
don
franco
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
went
back
to
his
mortar
for
talking
to
such
people
as
that
was
just
beating
water
with
a
pestle
neither
more
nor
less
he
said
but
goosefoot
said
as
soon
as
ntoni
s
back
was
turned
he
ought
to
get
rid
of
don
michele
for
another
reason
he
s
after
his
sister
but
ntoni
is
worse
than
a
pig
now
that
santuzza
has
taken
to
keeping
goosefoot
felt
don
michele
to
be
a
weight
on
his
mind
since
that
active
official
had
taken
to
looking
askance
at
rocco
spatu
and
cinghialenta
and
himself
whenever
he
saw
them
together
for
that
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
him
those
poor
malavoglia
had
come
to
such
a
pass
that
they
were
the
talk
of
the
place
on
account
of
their
brother
now
everybody
knew
that
don
michele
often
walked
up
and
down
the
black
street
to
spite
the
zuppidda
who
was
always
mounting
guard
over
her
girl
with
her
distaff
in
her
hand
and
don
michele
not
to
lose
time
had
taken
to
looking
at
lia
who
had
now
become
a
very
pretty
girl
and
had
no
one
to
look
after
her
except
her
sister
who
would
say
to
her
come
lia
let
us
go
in
it
is
not
nice
for
us
to
stand
at
the
door
now
we
are
but
lia
was
vain
worse
than
her
brother
ntoni
and
she
liked
to
stand
at
the
door
that
people
might
see
her
pretty
flowered
kerchief
and
have
people
say
to
her
how
pretty
you
look
in
that
kerchief
cousin
lia
while
don
michele
devoured
her
with
his
eyes
poor
mena
while
she
stood
at
the
door
waiting
for
her
drunken
brother
to
come
home
felt
so
humbled
and
abased
that
she
wanted
the
energy
to
order
her
sister
to
come
in
because
don
michele
passed
by
and
lia
said
are
you
afraid
he
will
eat
me
nobody
wants
any
of
us
now
that
we
have
got
nothing
left
look
at
my
brother
even
the
dogs
will
have
nothing
to
say
to
him
if
ntoni
had
a
spark
of
courage
said
goosefoot
he
would
get
rid
of
that
don
michele
but
ntoni
had
another
reason
for
wishing
to
get
rid
of
don
michele
santuzza
after
having
quarrelled
with
don
michele
had
taken
a
fancy
to
ntoni
malavoglia
for
that
fashion
he
had
of
wearing
his
cap
and
of
swaggering
a
little
when
he
walked
that
he
had
learned
when
he
was
a
soldier
and
used
to
hide
for
him
behind
the
counter
the
remains
of
the
customers
dinners
and
to
fill
his
glass
as
well
now
and
then
on
the
sly
in
this
way
she
kept
him
about
the
tavern
as
fat
and
as
sleek
as
the
butcher
s
dog
ntoni
meantime
discharged
himself
to
a
certain
extent
of
his
obligation
to
her
by
taking
her
part
sometimes
even
to
the
extent
of
thumps
with
those
unpleasant
people
who
chose
to
find
fault
with
their
bills
and
to
scold
and
swear
about
the
place
for
ever
so
long
before
they
would
consent
to
pay
them
with
those
who
were
friends
with
the
hostess
on
the
contrary
he
was
chatty
and
pleasant
and
kept
an
eye
on
the
counter
too
while
santuzza
went
to
confession
so
that
every
one
there
liked
him
and
treated
him
as
if
he
were
at
home
all
but
uncle
santoro
who
looked
askance
at
him
and
muttered
between
one
ave
maria
and
another
against
him
and
how
he
lived
upon
his
girl
like
a
canon
without
lifting
a
finger
santuzza
replying
that
she
was
the
mistress
and
if
it
were
her
pleasure
to
keep
ntoni
malavoglia
for
herself
as
fat
as
a
canon
she
should
do
it
she
had
no
need
of
anybody
yes
yes
growled
uncle
santoro
when
he
could
get
her
for
a
minute
by
herself
you
always
need
don
michele
master
filippo
has
told
me
time
and
again
that
he
means
to
have
done
with
it
that
he
won
t
keep
the
wine
in
the
cellar
any
longer
and
we
must
get
it
into
the
place
don
filippo
must
attend
to
his
own
affairs
but
i
tell
you
once
for
all
that
if
i
have
to
pay
the
duty
twice
over
i
won
t
have
don
michele
here
again
i
won
t
i
won
t
she
could
not
forgive
don
michele
the
ugly
trick
he
had
played
her
with
the
zuppidda
after
all
that
time
that
he
had
lived
like
a
at
the
tavern
for
love
of
his
uniform
and
ntoni
malavoglia
with
no
uniform
at
all
was
worth
ten
of
don
michele
whatever
she
gave
to
him
she
gave
with
all
her
heart
in
this
way
ntoni
earned
his
living
and
when
his
grandfather
reproved
him
for
doing
nothing
or
his
sister
looked
gravely
at
him
with
her
large
melancholy
eyes
he
would
reply
and
do
i
ask
you
for
anything
i
don
t
spend
any
money
out
of
the
house
and
i
earn
my
own
it
would
be
better
that
you
should
die
of
hunger
said
his
grandfather
and
that
we
all
fell
dead
on
the
at
last
they
spoke
no
more
to
each
other
turning
their
backs
as
they
sat
padron
ntoni
was
driven
to
silence
sooner
than
quarrel
with
his
grandson
and
ntoni
tired
of
being
preached
to
left
them
there
whining
and
went
off
to
rocco
spatu
and
cousin
vanni
who
at
least
were
jolly
and
could
find
every
day
some
new
trick
to
play
off
on
somebody
they
found
one
one
day
which
was
to
serenade
uncle
crucifix
the
night
of
his
marriage
with
his
niece
vespa
and
they
brought
under
his
windows
all
the
crew
to
whom
uncle
crucifix
would
no
longer
lend
a
penny
with
broken
pots
and
bottles
sheep
s
bells
and
whistles
of
cane
making
the
devil
s
own
row
until
midnight
so
that
vespa
got
up
the
next
morning
rather
greener
than
usual
and
railed
at
that
hussy
of
a
santuzza
in
whose
tavern
all
that
noisy
raff
had
got
up
that
nasty
trick
and
it
was
all
out
of
jealousy
she
had
done
it
because
she
couldn
t
get
married
herself
as
vespa
had
everybody
laughed
at
uncle
crucifix
when
he
appeared
in
the
piazza
in
his
new
clothes
yellow
as
a
corpse
and
half
frightened
out
of
his
wits
at
vespa
and
the
money
she
had
made
him
spend
for
his
new
clothes
vespa
was
always
spending
and
spilling
and
if
he
had
left
her
alone
would
have
emptied
his
in
a
fortnight
and
she
said
that
now
she
was
mistress
so
that
there
was
the
devil
to
pay
between
them
every
day
his
wife
planted
her
nails
in
his
face
and
screamed
that
she
was
going
to
keep
the
keys
herself
that
she
didn
t
see
why
she
should
want
a
bit
of
bread
or
a
new
kerchief
worse
than
she
did
before
and
if
she
had
known
what
was
to
come
of
her
marriage
with
such
a
husband
too
she
would
have
kept
her
fields
and
her
medal
of
the
daughters
of
mary
and
he
screamed
too
that
he
was
ruined
that
he
was
no
longer
master
in
his
own
house
that
now
he
had
the
cholera
in
his
house
in
good
earnest
that
they
wanted
to
kill
him
before
his
time
to
waste
the
money
that
he
had
spent
his
life
in
putting
together
he
too
if
he
had
known
how
it
would
be
would
have
seen
them
both
at
the
devil
his
wife
and
her
fields
first
that
he
didn
t
need
a
wife
and
they
had
frightened
him
into
taking
vespa
telling
him
that
brasi
cipolla
was
going
to
run
off
with
her
and
her
fields
cursed
be
her
fields
just
at
this
point
it
came
out
that
brasi
cipolla
had
allowed
himself
to
be
taken
possession
of
by
the
mangiacarubbe
like
a
great
stupid
lout
as
he
was
and
padron
fortunato
was
always
hunting
for
them
up
and
down
on
the
heath
in
the
ravine
under
the
bridge
everywhere
foaming
at
the
mouth
and
swearing
that
if
he
caught
them
he
would
kick
them
as
long
as
he
could
stand
and
would
wring
his
son
s
ears
off
for
him
uncle
crucifix
at
this
became
quite
desperate
and
said
that
the
mangiacarubbe
had
ruined
him
by
not
running
off
with
brasi
a
week
sooner
this
is
the
will
of
god
he
said
beating
his
breast
the
will
of
god
is
that
i
should
have
taken
this
wasp
to
expiate
my
and
his
sins
must
have
been
heavy
for
the
wasp
poisoned
the
bread
in
his
mouth
and
made
him
suffer
the
pains
of
purgatory
both
by
day
and
by
night
the
neighbors
never
came
near
the
malavoglia
now
any
more
than
if
the
cholera
were
still
in
the
house
but
left
her
alone
with
her
sister
in
her
flowered
kerchief
or
with
nunziata
and
her
cousin
anna
when
they
had
the
charity
to
come
and
chat
with
her
a
bit
as
for
anna
she
was
as
badly
off
as
they
were
with
her
drunkard
of
a
son
and
now
everybody
knew
all
about
it
and
nunziata
too
who
had
been
so
little
when
that
scamp
of
a
father
of
hers
had
deserted
her
and
gone
elsewhere
to
seek
his
fortune
the
poor
things
felt
for
each
other
for
that
very
reason
when
they
talked
together
in
low
tones
with
bent
heads
and
hands
folded
under
their
aprons
and
also
when
they
were
silent
each
absorbed
in
her
own
pain
when
people
are
as
badly
off
as
we
are
said
lia
speaking
like
a
woman
every
one
must
take
care
of
one
s
self
and
look
after
one
s
own
don
michele
every
now
and
then
would
stop
and
joke
with
them
a
little
so
that
the
girls
got
used
to
his
cap
and
were
no
longer
afraid
of
him
and
little
by
little
lia
began
to
joke
with
him
herself
and
to
laugh
at
him
nor
did
mena
dare
to
scold
her
or
to
leave
her
and
go
into
the
kitchen
now
they
had
no
mother
but
stayed
with
them
crouching
on
the
looking
up
and
down
the
street
with
her
tired
eyes
now
that
they
were
deserted
by
the
neighbors
they
felt
their
hearts
swell
with
gratitude
towards
don
michele
who
with
all
his
uniform
did
not
disdain
to
stop
at
the
malavoglia
s
door
for
a
chat
now
and
then
and
if
don
michele
found
lia
alone
he
would
look
into
her
eyes
pulling
his
mustaches
with
his
cap
on
one
side
and
say
to
her
what
a
pretty
girl
you
are
cousin
malavoglia
nobody
else
had
ever
told
her
that
so
she
turned
as
red
as
a
tomato
how
does
it
happen
that
you
are
not
yet
married
don
michele
asked
her
one
day
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
answered
that
she
did
not
know
you
ought
to
have
a
dress
of
silk
and
wool
and
long
and
then
upon
my
word
there
d
be
many
a
fine
city
lady
not
fit
to
hold
a
candle
to
a
dress
of
silk
and
wool
would
not
be
a
proper
thing
for
me
don
michele
replied
lia
but
why
hasn
t
the
zuppidda
one
and
the
mangiacarubbe
now
that
she
has
caught
brasi
cipolla
won
t
she
have
one
too
and
vespa
too
can
have
one
if
she
they
are
rich
they
cruel
fate
cried
don
michele
striking
the
hilt
of
his
sword
with
his
fist
i
wish
i
could
win
a
tern
in
the
lottery
cousin
lia
then
i
d
show
you
what
i
d
sometimes
don
michele
would
add
permit
me
with
his
hand
to
his
cap
and
sit
down
near
them
on
the
stones
mena
thought
he
came
for
barbara
and
said
nothing
but
to
lia
don
michele
swore
that
he
did
not
come
there
on
account
of
barbara
that
he
never
had
that
he
never
should
that
he
was
thinking
of
quite
a
different
person
did
not
cousin
lia
know
that
and
he
rubbed
his
chin
and
twisted
his
mustaches
and
stared
at
her
like
a
basilisk
the
girl
turned
all
sorts
of
colors
and
got
up
to
run
into
the
house
but
don
michele
caught
her
by
the
hand
and
said
do
you
wish
to
offend
me
cousin
malavoglia
why
do
you
treat
me
in
this
way
stay
where
you
are
nobody
means
to
eat
so
while
they
were
waiting
for
the
men
to
come
back
from
sea
they
passed
the
time
she
in
the
door
and
don
michele
on
the
stones
breaking
little
twigs
to
pieces
because
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
his
hands
once
he
asked
her
would
you
like
to
go
and
live
in
town
what
should
i
do
in
town
that
s
the
place
for
you
you
were
not
meant
to
live
here
with
these
peasants
upon
my
honor
you
are
of
a
better
sort
than
they
are
you
ought
to
live
in
a
pretty
little
cottage
or
in
a
villa
and
to
go
to
the
marina
or
to
the
promenade
when
there
is
music
dressed
prettily
as
i
should
like
to
see
you
with
a
pretty
silk
kerchief
on
your
head
and
an
amber
necklace
here
i
feel
as
if
i
were
living
in
the
midst
of
pigs
upon
my
honor
i
can
hardly
wait
for
the
time
when
i
shall
be
promoted
and
recalled
to
town
as
they
have
promised
me
next
lia
began
to
laugh
as
if
it
were
all
a
joke
shaking
her
shoulders
at
the
idea
she
who
didn
t
know
even
what
silk
kerchiefs
or
amber
necklaces
were
like
then
one
day
don
michele
drew
out
of
his
pocket
with
great
mystery
a
fine
red
and
yellow
silk
kerchief
wrapped
up
in
a
pretty
paper
and
wanted
to
make
a
present
of
it
to
cousin
lia
no
no
said
she
turning
fiery
red
i
wouldn
t
take
it
no
not
if
you
killed
don
michele
insisted
i
did
not
expect
this
cousin
lia
i
do
not
deserve
but
after
all
he
had
to
wrap
the
kerchief
once
more
in
the
paper
and
put
it
back
into
his
pocket
after
this
whenever
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
don
michele
lia
ran
off
to
hide
herself
in
the
house
fearing
that
he
would
try
to
give
her
the
kerchief
it
was
in
vain
that
don
michele
passed
up
and
down
the
street
the
zuppidda
screaming
at
him
all
the
time
in
vain
that
he
stretched
his
neck
peering
into
the
malavoglia
s
door
no
one
was
ever
to
be
seen
so
that
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
in
the
girls
when
they
saw
him
standing
before
them
stared
trembling
as
if
they
had
the
ague
not
knowing
what
to
do
you
would
not
take
the
silk
kerchief
cousin
lia
he
said
to
the
girl
who
turned
red
as
a
poppy
but
i
have
come
all
the
same
because
i
like
you
all
so
much
what
is
your
brother
ntoni
doing
now
now
mena
turned
red
too
when
he
asked
what
her
brother
ntoni
was
doing
for
he
was
doing
nothing
and
don
michele
went
on
i
am
afraid
he
will
do
something
that
you
will
not
like
your
brother
ntoni
i
am
your
friend
and
i
take
no
notice
but
when
another
brigadier
comes
in
my
place
he
will
be
wanting
to
know
what
your
brother
is
always
about
with
cinghialenta
and
that
other
pretty
specimen
rocco
spatu
down
by
the
rotolo
in
the
evening
or
walking
about
the
downs
as
if
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
wear
out
their
shoes
look
after
him
well
cousin
mena
and
listen
to
what
i
tell
you
tell
him
not
to
go
so
much
with
that
meddling
old
wretch
goosefoot
in
vanni
pizzuti
s
shop
for
we
know
everything
and
he
will
come
to
harm
among
them
the
others
are
old
foxes
and
you
had
better
tell
your
grandfather
to
stop
him
from
walking
so
much
up
and
down
the
beach
for
the
beach
is
not
meant
to
walk
about
on
and
the
cliffs
of
the
rotolo
have
ears
tell
him
and
one
can
see
very
well
even
without
glasses
the
boats
that
put
out
from
there
at
dusk
as
if
they
were
going
to
fish
for
bats
tell
him
this
cousin
mena
and
tell
him
too
that
this
warning
comes
from
one
who
is
your
friend
as
for
master
cinghialenta
and
rocco
spatu
and
vanni
pizzuti
as
well
we
have
our
eye
on
them
your
brother
trusts
old
goosefoot
but
he
does
not
know
that
the
coastguards
have
a
percentage
on
smuggled
goods
and
that
they
always
manage
to
get
hold
of
some
one
of
a
gang
and
give
him
a
share
to
spy
on
them
that
they
may
be
mena
opened
her
eyes
still
wider
and
turned
pale
without
quite
understanding
all
this
long
speech
but
she
had
been
trembling
already
for
fear
that
her
brother
would
get
into
trouble
with
the
men
in
uniform
don
michele
to
give
her
courage
took
her
hand
and
went
on
if
it
came
to
be
known
that
i
had
warned
you
it
would
be
all
over
with
me
i
am
risking
my
uniform
in
telling
you
this
because
i
am
so
fond
of
all
you
malavoglia
but
i
should
be
very
sorry
if
your
brother
got
into
trouble
no
i
don
t
want
to
meet
him
some
night
in
some
ugly
place
where
he
has
no
business
no
i
wouldn
t
have
it
happen
to
catch
a
booty
worth
a
thousand
francs
upon
my
honor
i
wouldn
the
poor
girls
hadn
t
a
moment
s
peace
after
don
michele
had
warned
them
of
this
new
cause
of
anxiety
they
didn
t
shut
their
eyes
of
a
night
waiting
behind
the
door
for
their
brother
sometimes
until
very
late
trembling
with
cold
and
terror
while
he
went
singing
up
and
down
the
streets
with
rocco
spatu
and
the
rest
of
the
gang
and
the
poor
girls
seemed
to
hear
the
cries
and
the
shots
as
they
had
heard
them
that
night
when
there
was
the
talk
of
hunting
quail
you
go
to
bed
and
to
sleep
said
mena
to
her
sister
you
are
too
young
for
such
things
as
to
her
grandfather
she
said
nothing
for
she
wished
to
spare
him
this
fresh
trouble
but
to
ntoni
when
she
saw
him
a
little
more
quiet
than
usual
sitting
at
the
door
with
his
chin
upon
his
hands
she
took
courage
to
say
what
are
you
doing
going
about
with
rocco
spatu
and
you
have
been
seen
with
them
at
the
rotolo
and
on
the
downs
and
beware
of
goosefoot
remember
how
jesus
said
to
john
beware
of
them
whom
god
has
who
told
you
that
said
ntoni
leaping
up
as
if
he
were
possessed
tell
me
who
told
don
michele
told
me
she
answered
with
tearful
eyes
he
told
me
that
you
should
beware
of
goosefoot
and
that
to
catch
the
smugglers
they
had
to
get
information
from
some
one
of
the
he
told
you
nothing
else
no
he
told
me
nothing
then
ntoni
swore
that
there
wasn
t
a
word
of
truth
in
the
whole
of
it
and
told
her
she
mustn
t
tell
his
grandfather
then
he
got
up
and
went
off
in
a
hurry
to
the
tavern
to
drown
his
worries
in
wine
and
if
he
met
any
of
the
fellows
in
uniform
he
gave
them
a
wide
berth
after
all
don
michele
really
knew
nothing
about
it
and
only
talked
at
random
to
frighten
him
because
he
was
jealous
about
who
had
turned
him
don
michele
out
of
the
house
like
a
mangy
dog
and
in
short
he
wasn
t
afraid
either
of
don
michele
or
of
any
of
his
crew
that
were
paid
to
suck
the
blood
of
the
people
a
fine
thing
to
be
sure
don
michele
had
no
need
to
help
himself
in
that
fashion
fat
and
sleek
as
he
was
and
he
must
needs
try
to
lay
hands
on
some
poor
helpless
devil
or
other
if
he
tried
to
get
hold
of
a
stray
piece
and
that
other
idea
too
that
to
get
anything
in
from
outside
the
country
one
must
pay
the
duty
as
if
the
things
had
been
stolen
and
don
michele
and
his
spies
must
come
poking
their
noses
into
it
they
were
free
to
take
whatever
they
liked
and
were
paid
for
doing
it
but
others
if
they
tried
at
the
risk
of
their
lives
to
get
their
goods
on
shore
were
treated
worse
than
thieves
and
shot
down
like
wolves
with
pistols
and
carbines
but
it
never
was
a
sin
to
rob
thieves
don
giammaria
said
so
himself
in
the
druggist
s
shop
and
don
franco
nodded
beard
and
all
and
sneered
that
when
they
got
a
republic
there
would
be
no
more
such
dirty
work
as
that
nor
of
those
devil
s
officials
added
the
vicar
a
lot
of
idle
fellows
who
are
paid
for
carrying
guns
about
snarled
the
druggist
like
the
priests
who
take
forty
centimes
for
saying
a
mass
tell
us
don
giammaria
how
much
capital
do
you
put
into
the
masses
that
you
get
paid
for
about
as
much
as
you
put
into
that
dirty
water
that
you
make
us
pay
the
eyes
out
of
our
heads
for
said
the
priest
foaming
at
the
mouth
don
franco
had
learned
to
laugh
like
don
silvestro
just
on
purpose
to
put
don
giammaria
into
a
passion
and
he
went
on
without
listening
to
him
yes
in
half
an
hour
their
work
is
done
and
they
can
amuse
themselves
for
the
rest
of
the
day
just
the
same
as
don
michele
who
goes
flitting
about
like
a
great
ugly
bird
all
day
long
now
that
he
doesn
t
keep
the
benches
warm
at
santuzza
s
any
for
that
he
has
taken
it
up
with
me
interposed
ntoni
and
he
is
as
cross
as
a
bear
and
goes
swaggering
about
because
he
has
a
sabre
tied
to
him
but
by
our
lady
s
blood
one
time
or
another
i
ll
beat
it
about
his
head
that
sabre
of
his
to
show
him
how
much
i
care
for
it
and
for
bravo
exclaimed
the
druggist
that
s
the
way
to
talk
the
people
ought
to
show
their
teeth
but
not
here
i
don
t
want
a
fuss
in
my
shop
the
government
would
give
anything
to
get
me
into
a
scrape
but
i
don
t
care
to
have
anything
to
do
with
their
judges
and
tribunals
and
the
rest
of
their
ntoni
malavoglia
raised
his
fist
in
the
air
and
swore
that
he
was
going
to
have
done
with
it
once
for
all
if
he
went
to
the
galleys
for
it
for
the
matter
of
that
he
had
nothing
to
lose
santuzza
no
longer
looked
upon
him
as
she
formerly
did
so
much
had
her
father
obtained
of
her
always
whining
and
wheedling
at
her
between
one
ave
maria
and
another
since
master
filippo
had
left
off
keeping
his
wine
in
their
cellar
he
said
that
the
customers
were
thinning
off
like
flies
at
saint
andrew
s
day
now
they
no
longer
found
master
filippo
s
wine
which
they
had
drunk
ever
since
they
were
babies
uncle
santoro
kept
on
saying
to
his
daughter
what
do
you
want
with
that
great
useless
ntoni
malavoglia
always
about
the
place
don
t
you
see
that
he
is
eating
you
out
of
house
and
home
to
no
purpose
you
fatten
him
like
a
pig
and
then
he
goes
off
and
makes
eyes
at
vespa
or
the
mangiacarubbe
now
that
they
are
rich
or
he
said
your
customers
are
leaving
you
because
you
always
have
ntoni
after
you
so
that
nobody
has
a
chance
to
laugh
or
talk
with
you
or
he
s
so
dirty
and
ragged
that
he
is
a
shame
to
be
seen
the
place
looks
like
a
stable
and
people
don
t
want
to
drink
out
of
the
glasses
after
him
don
michele
looked
well
at
the
door
with
his
cap
with
the
gold
braid
people
like
to
drink
their
wine
in
peace
when
they
have
paid
for
it
and
they
like
to
see
a
man
with
a
sabre
at
the
door
and
everybody
took
off
their
caps
to
him
and
nobody
was
likely
to
deny
a
debt
to
you
while
he
was
about
now
that
he
doesn
t
come
master
filippo
doesn
t
come
either
the
other
day
he
was
passing
and
i
wanted
him
to
come
in
but
he
said
it
was
of
no
use
now
for
he
couldn
t
get
anything
in
contraband
any
longer
now
you
had
quarrelled
with
don
michele
which
is
neither
good
for
the
soul
nor
for
the
body
people
are
beginning
to
murmur
already
and
to
say
that
the
charity
you
give
to
ntoni
is
not
blameless
and
if
it
goes
on
the
vicar
may
hear
of
it
and
you
may
lose
your
at
first
santuzza
held
out
for
as
she
said
she
was
determined
to
be
mistress
in
her
own
house
but
afterwards
she
began
to
see
things
in
another
light
and
no
longer
treated
ntoni
as
she
used
to
do
if
there
was
anything
left
at
meals
she
did
not
give
it
to
him
and
she
left
the
glasses
dirty
and
gave
him
no
wine
so
that
at
last
he
began
to
look
cross
and
then
she
told
him
that
she
didn
t
want
any
idle
fellows
about
the
place
and
that
she
and
her
father
earned
their
bread
and
that
he
ought
to
do
the
same
couldn
t
he
help
a
bit
about
the
house
chopping
wood
or
blowing
up
the
fire
instead
of
always
shouting
and
screaming
about
or
sleeping
with
his
head
on
his
arms
or
else
spitting
about
everywhere
so
that
one
didn
t
know
where
to
set
one
s
foot
ntoni
for
a
while
did
chop
the
wood
or
blew
the
fire
which
he
preferred
as
it
was
easier
work
but
he
found
it
hard
to
work
like
a
dog
worse
than
he
did
at
home
and
be
treated
like
a
dog
into
the
bargain
with
hard
words
and
cross
looks
and
all
for
the
sake
of
the
dirty
plates
they
gave
him
to
lick
at
last
one
day
when
santuzza
had
just
come
back
from
confession
he
made
a
scene
complaining
that
don
michele
had
begun
to
hover
about
the
house
again
and
that
he
had
waited
for
her
in
the
piazza
when
she
came
home
from
church
and
that
uncle
santoro
had
called
to
him
when
he
heard
his
voice
as
he
was
passing
and
had
followed
him
as
far
as
vanni
pizzuti
s
shop
feeling
the
walls
with
his
stick
santuzza
flew
into
a
passion
and
said
that
he
had
come
on
purpose
to
bring
her
into
sin
again
and
make
her
lose
her
communion
if
you
are
not
pleased
you
can
go
she
said
did
i
say
anything
when
i
saw
you
running
after
vespa
and
the
mangiacarubbe
now
that
they
have
got
themselves
married
but
ntoni
swore
there
wasn
t
a
word
of
truth
in
it
that
he
didn
t
go
running
after
any
women
and
that
she
might
spit
in
his
face
if
she
saw
him
speaking
to
either
of
them
no
you
won
t
get
rid
of
him
that
way
said
uncle
santoro
don
t
you
see
that
he
won
t
leave
you
because
he
lives
at
your
expense
you
won
t
get
him
out
unless
you
kick
him
out
master
filippo
has
told
me
that
he
can
t
keep
his
new
wine
any
longer
in
the
barrels
and
that
he
won
t
let
you
have
it
unless
you
make
it
up
with
don
michele
and
help
him
to
smuggle
it
in
as
he
used
to
and
he
went
off
after
master
filippo
to
vanni
pizzuti
s
shop
feeling
his
way
along
the
walls
with
his
stick
his
daughter
put
on
haughty
airs
protesting
that
she
never
would
forgive
don
michele
after
the
ugly
trick
he
had
played
her
let
me
manage
it
said
uncle
santoro
i
assure
you
i
can
be
discreet
enough
about
it
don
t
believe
i
will
ever
let
you
go
back
and
lick
don
michele
s
boots
am
i
your
father
or
not
ntoni
since
santuzza
had
begun
to
be
rude
to
him
was
obliged
to
look
somewhere
else
for
his
dinner
for
he
was
ashamed
to
go
home
where
all
the
time
his
people
were
thinking
of
him
with
every
mouthful
they
ate
feeling
almost
as
if
he
were
dead
too
and
they
did
not
even
spread
the
cloth
any
more
but
sat
scattered
about
the
room
with
the
plates
on
their
knees
this
is
the
last
blow
for
me
in
my
old
age
said
his
grandfather
and
those
who
saw
him
pass
bent
down
with
the
nets
on
his
shoulders
on
his
way
to
his
day
s
work
said
to
each
other
this
is
padron
ntoni
s
last
winter
it
will
not
be
long
before
those
orphans
are
left
quite
alone
in
the
and
lia
when
mena
told
her
to
stay
in
the
house
when
don
michele
passed
by
answered
with
a
pout
yes
it
is
worth
while
staying
in
the
house
for
such
precious
persons
as
we
are
you
needn
t
be
afraid
anybody
ll
want
to
steal
oh
if
your
mother
were
here
you
wouldn
t
talk
in
that
way
murmured
mena
if
my
mother
were
here
i
shouldn
t
be
an
orphan
and
shouldn
t
have
to
take
care
of
myself
nor
would
ntoni
go
wandering
about
the
streets
until
it
is
a
shame
to
hear
one
s
self
called
his
sister
and
not
a
soul
would
think
of
taking
ntoni
malavoglia
s
sister
for
a
ntoni
now
that
he
was
in
bad
luck
was
not
ashamed
to
show
himself
everywhere
with
rocco
spatu
and
with
cinghialenta
on
the
downs
and
by
the
rotolo
and
was
seen
whispering
to
them
mysteriously
like
a
lot
of
wolves
don
michele
came
back
to
mena
saying
your
brother
will
play
you
an
ugly
trick
some
day
cousin
mena
was
driven
to
going
out
to
look
for
her
brother
on
the
downs
or
towards
the
rotolo
or
at
the
door
of
the
tavern
sobbing
and
crying
and
pulling
him
by
the
sleeve
but
he
replied
no
it
is
all
don
michele
he
is
determined
to
ruin
me
i
tell
you
he
is
always
plotting
against
me
with
uncle
santoro
i
have
heard
them
myself
in
pizzuti
s
shop
and
that
spy
said
to
him
and
if
i
come
back
to
your
daughter
what
kind
of
a
figure
shall
i
cut
and
uncle
santoro
answered
but
when
i
tell
you
that
the
whole
place
will
by
that
time
be
dying
of
envy
of
you
but
what
do
you
mean
to
do
asked
mena
with
her
pale
face
think
of
our
mother
ntoni
and
of
us
who
have
no
one
left
in
the
world
nothing
i
mean
to
put
santuzza
to
shame
and
him
too
as
they
go
to
the
mass
before
all
the
world
i
mean
to
tell
them
what
i
think
of
them
and
make
them
a
for
everybody
i
fear
nobody
in
the
world
and
the
druggist
himself
shall
hear
in
short
it
was
useless
for
mena
to
weep
or
to
beg
he
went
on
saying
that
he
had
nothing
to
lose
and
the
others
should
look
after
themselves
and
not
blame
him
that
he
was
tired
of
that
life
and
meant
to
end
it
as
don
franco
said
and
since
he
was
not
kindly
received
at
the
tavern
he
took
to
lounging
about
the
piazza
especially
on
sundays
and
sat
on
the
to
see
what
sort
of
a
face
those
shameless
wretches
would
wear
trying
to
deceive
not
only
the
world
but
our
lord
and
the
madonna
under
their
very
eyes
santuzza
not
wishing
to
meet
ntoni
went
to
aci
castello
to
mass
early
in
the
morning
not
to
be
led
into
temptation
ntoni
watched
the
with
her
face
wrapped
in
her
mantle
not
looking
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
now
she
had
caught
a
husband
vespa
all
over
flounces
and
with
a
very
big
rosary
went
to
besiege
heaven
that
she
might
be
delivered
from
her
scourge
of
a
husband
and
ntoni
snarled
after
them
now
that
they
have
caught
husbands
they
want
nothing
more
they
ve
somebody
to
see
that
they
have
plenty
to
uncle
crucifix
had
lost
even
his
devotional
habits
since
he
had
got
vespa
on
his
shoulders
he
kept
away
from
church
to
be
free
from
her
presence
at
least
for
so
long
a
time
to
the
great
peril
of
his
soul
this
is
my
last
year
he
whined
and
now
he
was
always
running
after
padron
ntoni
and
the
others
who
were
badly
off
this
year
i
shall
have
hail
in
my
vineyard
you
ll
see
i
shall
not
have
a
drop
of
wine
you
know
uncle
crucifix
replied
padron
ntoni
as
soon
as
you
like
i
am
ready
to
go
to
the
notary
for
that
affair
of
the
house
and
i
have
the
money
that
one
cared
for
nothing
but
his
house
and
other
people
s
affairs
were
nothing
to
him
don
t
talk
to
me
of
the
notary
padron
ntoni
if
i
hear
any
one
speak
of
a
notary
i
am
reminded
of
the
day
when
i
let
vespa
drag
me
before
one
cursed
be
that
day
but
cousin
goosefoot
who
smelled
a
bargain
said
to
him
that
witch
of
a
wasp
after
your
death
may
be
capable
of
selling
the
house
by
the
medlar
for
next
to
nothing
isn
t
it
better
that
you
should
finish
up
your
own
affairs
while
you
can
and
uncle
crucifix
would
reply
yes
yes
i
ll
go
to
the
notary
but
you
must
let
me
make
some
profit
on
the
affair
look
how
many
losses
i
have
had
and
goosefoot
feigning
to
agree
with
him
would
add
that
witch
of
a
wife
of
yours
must
not
know
that
you
have
the
money
or
she
might
twist
your
neck
for
the
sake
of
spending
it
in
necklaces
and
new
and
he
went
on
at
least
the
mangiacarubbe
does
not
throw
her
money
away
now
she
has
caught
a
husband
look
how
she
comes
to
church
in
a
cotton
gown
i
don
t
care
for
the
mangiacarubbe
but
i
know
she
and
all
the
other
women
ought
to
be
burned
alive
they
are
only
put
in
the
world
for
our
damnation
do
you
believe
that
she
doesn
t
spend
the
money
that
s
all
put
on
to
take
in
padron
fortunato
who
goes
about
declaring
that
he
d
rather
marry
a
girl
himself
out
of
the
street
than
let
his
money
go
to
that
beggar
who
has
stolen
his
son
from

my
part

and
so
he
sent
him
off
for
that
time
don
michele

something

in
his
head
repeated
goosefoot
running
his
tongue
out
behind
padron
ntoni
s
back
and
making
a
sign
towards
his
grandson
who
was
leaning
against
the
wall
with
a
ragged
jacket
over
one
shoulder
and
casting
furious
looks
at
uncle
santoro
who
had
taken
to
coming
to
mass
to
hold
out
his
hand
to
the
faithful
in
the
intervals
of
muttered
glorias
and
ave
marias
knowing
them
all
very
well
as
they
passed
him
on
their
way
out
saying
to
one
the
lord
bless
you
to
another
god
give
you
health
and
as
don
michele
passed
he
said
to
him
go
to
her
she
is
waiting
for
you
in
the
garden
holy
mary
pray
for
us
lord
be
merciful
to
me
a
sinner
when
don
michele
began
to
go
back
to
the
tavern
people
said
look
if
the
cat
and
dog
haven
t
made
friends
there
must
have
been
some
reason
for
their
quarrelling
and
master
filippo
has
gone
back
too
he
seems
to
have
been
fonder
of
don
michele
than
of
santuzza
some
people
wouldn
t
care
to
be
alone
even
in
then
ntoni
malavoglia
was
furious
finding
himself
hustled
out
of
the
tavern
worse
than
a
mangy
dog
without
even
a
penny
in
his
pocket
to
pay
to
go
and
drink
in
spite
of
don
michele
and
his
mustaches
and
sit
there
all
day
long
for
the
sake
of
plaguing
them
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
instead
of
which
he
was
obliged
to
spend
the
day
in
the
street
like
a
dog
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
and
his
nose
to
the
ground
muttering
blood
of
judas
one
day
there
ll
be
an
upsetting
there
that
there
rocco
spatu
and
cinghialenta
who
always
had
more
or
less
money
laughed
in
his
face
from
the
door
of
the
tavern
pointing
their
fingers
at
him
or
came
out
to
talk
to
him
in
low
tones
pulling
him
by
the
arm
in
the
direction
of
the
downs
or
whispering
in
his
ear
he
hesitated
always
about
giving
them
an
answer
like
a
fool
as
he
was
then
they
would
come
down
upon
him
both
at
once
you
deserve
to
die
of
hunger
there
in
sight
of
the
door
and
to
have
us
sneering
at
you
worse
than
don
michele
does
you
wretch
you
blood
of
judas
don
t
talk
like
that
cried
ntoni
shaking
his
fist
in
the
air
or
else
some
day
something
new
will
happen
that
there
will
but
the
others
went
sneering
off
and
left
him
until
at
last
they
succeeded
in
putting
him
into
such
a
fury
that
he
came
straight
into
the
middle
of
the
tavern
among
them
all
pale
as
a
corpse
with
his
hand
on
his
hip
and
on
his
shoulder
his
old
worn
jacket
which
he
wore
as
proudly
as
if
it
had
been
a
velvet
coat
turning
his
blazing
eyes
about
the
room
looking
out
for
somebody
don
michele
out
of
respect
for
his
own
uniform
pretended
not
to
see
him
and
made
as
if
he
would
go
away
but
ntoni
seeing
that
don
michele
was
not
in
the
humor
for
fighting
became
outrageously
insolent
sneering
at
him
and
at
santuzza
and
spitting
out
the
wine
which
he
drank
swearing
that
it
was
poison
and
baptized
besides
for
santuzza
had
mixed
it
with
water
and
they
were
simply
fools
to
go
into
such
a
place
as
that
to
throw
away
their
money
and
that
was
the
reason
why
he
had
left
off
coming
there
santuzza
touched
in
her
weakest
point
could
no
longer
command
her
temper
and
flew
out
at
him
saying
that
he
didn
t
come
because
they
wouldn
t
have
him
that
they
were
tired
of
keeping
him
for
charity
and
they
had
had
to
use
the
to
him
before
he
d
go
a
great
hungry
dog
and
ntoni
began
to
rage
and
storm
roaring
and
flinging
the
glasses
about
which
he
said
they
had
put
out
to
catch
that
other
great
codfish
in
uniform
but
he
would
bring
his
wine
out
at
his
nose
for
him
he
wasn
t
afraid
of
anybody
don
michele
white
with
rage
with
his
cap
on
one
side
stammered
this
will
end
badly
will
end
badly
while
santuzza
rained
flasks
and
glasses
upon
both
of
them
at
last
they
flew
at
each
other
with
their
fists
until
they
both
rolled
on
the
floor
like
two
dogs
and
the
others
went
at
them
with
kicks
and
thumps
trying
to
part
them
which
at
last
peppi
naso
the
butcher
succeeded
in
doing
by
dint
of
lashing
them
with
the
leather
strap
which
he
took
off
his
trousers
which
took
the
skin
off
wherever
it
touched
don
michele
brushed
off
his
uniform
picked
up
his
sabre
which
he
had
lost
in
the
scuffle
and
went
out
only
muttering
something
between
his
teeth
for
his
uniform
s
sake
but
ntoni
malavoglia
with
the
blood
streaming
from
his
nose
called
out
a
lot
of
bad
names
after
him
rubbing
his
nose
with
his
sleeve
meanwhile
and
swearing
that
he
would
soon
give
him
the
rest
of
it
xiv
malavoglia
did
meet
don
michele
and
gave
him
his
change
and
a
very
ugly
business
it
was
it
was
by
night
when
it
rained
in
torrents
and
so
dark
that
even
a
cat
could
have
seen
nothing
at
the
turn
on
the
down
which
leads
to
the
rotolo
whence
those
boats
put
out
so
quietly
making
believe
to
be
fishing
for
cod
at
midnight
and
where
ntoni
and
rocco
spatu
and
cinghialenta
and
other
fellows
well
known
to
the
used
to
hang
about
with
pipes
in
their
mouths
the
guards
knew
those
pipes
well
and
could
distinguish
them
perfectly
one
from
another
as
they
moved
about
among
the
rocks
where
they
lay
hidden
with
their
guns
in
their
hands
cousin
mena
said
don
michele
passing
once
more
down
the
black
street
cousin
mena
tell
your
brother
not
to
go
to
the
rotolo
of
nights
with
cinghialenta
and
rocco
but
ntoni
would
not
listen
for
the
empty
stomach
has
no
ears
and
he
no
longer
feared
don
michele
since
he
had
rolled
over
with
him
hand
to
hand
on
the
floor
of
the
tavern
and
he
had
sworn
too
to
give
him
the
rest
of
it
and
he
would
give
him
the
rest
of
it
whenever
he
met
him
and
he
wasn
t
going
to
pass
for
a
coward
in
the
eyes
of
santuzza
and
the
rest
who
had
been
present
when
he
threatened
him
i
said
i
d
give
him
the
rest
when
i
met
him
next
and
so
i
will
and
if
he
chooses
to
meet
me
at
the
rotolo
i
ll
meet
him
at
the
rotolo
he
repeated
to
his
companions
who
had
also
brought
with
them
the
son
of
la
locca
they
had
passed
the
evening
at
the
tavern
drinking
and
roaring
for
a
tavern
is
like
a
free
port
and
no
one
can
be
sent
out
of
it
as
long
as
they
have
money
to
pay
their
score
and
to
rattle
in
their
pockets
don
michele
had
gone
by
on
his
rounds
but
rocco
spatu
who
knew
the
law
said
spitting
and
leaning
against
the
wall
the
better
to
balance
himself
that
as
long
as
the
lamp
at
the
door
was
lighted
they
could
not
turn
them
out
we
have
a
right
to
stay
so
long
he
repeated
ntoni
malavoglia
also
enjoyed
keeping
santuzza
from
going
to
bed
as
she
sat
behind
her
glasses
yawning
and
dozing
in
the
mean
time
uncle
santoro
feeling
his
way
about
with
his
hands
had
put
the
lamp
out
and
shut
the
door
now
be
off
said
santuzza
i
don
t
choose
to
be
fined
for
your
sake
for
keeping
my
door
open
at
this
who
ll
fine
you
that
spy
don
michele
let
him
come
here
and
i
ll
pay
him
his
fine
tell
him
he
ll
find
ntoni
malavoglia
here
by
our
lady
s
meanwhile
the
santuzza
had
taken
him
by
the
shoulders
and
put
him
out
of
the
door
go
and
tell
him
yourself
and
get
into
scrapes
somewhere
else
i
don
t
mean
to
get
into
trouble
with
the
police
for
love
of
your
bright
ntoni
finding
himself
in
the
street
in
this
unceremonious
fashion
pulled
out
a
long
knife
and
swore
that
he
would
stab
both
santuzza
and
don
michele
cinghialenta
was
the
only
one
who
had
his
senses
and
he
pulled
him
by
the
coat
saying
leave
them
alone
now
have
you
forgotten
what
we
have
to
do
la
locca
s
son
felt
greatly
inclined
to
cry
he
s
drunk
observed
spatu
standing
under
the
bring
him
here
under
the
pipe
it
will
do
him
ntoni
quieted
a
little
by
the
drenching
he
got
from
the
let
himself
be
drawn
along
by
cinghialenta
scolding
all
the
while
swearing
that
as
sure
as
he
met
don
michele
he
d
give
him
what
he
had
promised
him
all
of
a
sudden
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
don
michele
who
was
also
prowling
in
the
vicinity
with
his
pistols
at
his
belt
and
his
trousers
thrust
into
his
boots
ntoni
became
quite
calm
all
of
a
sudden
and
they
all
stole
off
silently
in
the
direction
of
vanni
pizzuti
s
shop
when
they
reached
the
door
now
that
don
michele
was
no
longer
near
them
ntoni
insisted
that
they
should
stop
and
listen
to
what
he
had
to
say
did
you
see
where
don
michele
was
going
and
santuzza
said
she
was
sleepy
leave
don
michele
alone
can
t
you
said
that
way
he
won
t
interfere
with
you
re
all
a
lot
of
cowards
said
ntoni
you
re
afraid
of
don
you
re
drunk
said
cinghialenta
but
i
ll
show
you
whether
i
m
afraid
of
don
michele
now
that
i
ve
told
my
uncle
i
don
t
mean
to
have
anybody
coming
bothering
after
me
finding
out
how
i
earn
my
then
they
began
to
talk
under
their
breath
drawn
up
against
the
wall
while
the
noise
of
the
rain
drowned
their
voices
suddenly
the
clock
struck
and
they
all
stood
silent
counting
the
strokes
let
s
go
into
cousin
pizzuti
s
said
cinghialenta
he
can
keep
his
door
open
as
late
as
he
likes
and
doesn
t
need
to
have
a
it
s
dark
i
can
t
see
said
la
locca
s
son
we
ought
to
take
something
to
drink
said
rocco
spatu
or
we
shall
break
our
noses
on
the
cinghialenta
growled
as
if
we
were
just
out
for
our
pleasure
now
you
ll
be
wanting
master
vanni
to
give
you
a
i
have
no
need
of
lemonade
said
ntoni
you
ll
see
when
i
get
to
work
if
i
can
t
manage
as
well
as
any
of
cousin
pizzuti
didn
t
want
to
open
the
door
at
that
hour
and
replied
that
he
had
gone
to
bed
but
as
they
wouldn
t
leave
off
knocking
and
threatened
to
wake
up
the
whole
place
and
bring
the
guards
into
the
affair
he
consented
to
get
up
and
opened
the
door
in
his
drawers
are
you
mad
to
knock
in
that
way
he
exclaimed
i
saw
don
michele
pass
just
yes
we
saw
him
do
you
know
where
he
came
from
asked
pizzuti
looking
sharply
at
him
ntoni
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
vanni
as
he
stood
out
of
the
way
to
let
them
pass
winked
to
rocco
and
cinghialenta
he
s
been
at
the
malavoglia
s
he
whispered
i
saw
him
come
much
good
may
it
do
him
answered
cinghialenta
but
ntoni
ought
to
tell
his
sister
to
keep
him
when
we
have
anything
to
what
do
you
want
of
me
said
ntoni
thickly
nothing
never
mind
we
can
do
if
we
can
do
nothing
why
did
you
bring
me
away
from
the
tavern
said
rocco
spatu
i
m
wet
it
was
something
else
that
we
were
speaking
of
and
vanni
continued
yes
the
man
has
come
from
town
and
he
says
the
goods
are
there
but
it
will
be
no
joke
trying
to
land
them
in
such
weather
as
so
much
the
better
no
one
will
be
looking
out
for
yes
but
the
guards
have
sharp
ears
and
mind
you
it
seems
to
me
that
i
heard
some
one
prowling
about
just
now
and
trying
to
look
into
the
a
moment
s
silence
ensued
and
vanni
to
put
an
end
to
it
brought
out
three
glasses
and
filled
them
with
bitters
i
don
t
care
about
the
guard
cried
rocco
spatu
after
he
had
drunk
so
much
the
worse
for
them
if
they
meddle
in
my
business
i
ve
got
a
little
knife
here
that
is
better
than
all
their
pistols
and
makes
no
noise
we
earn
our
bread
the
best
way
we
can
said
cinghialenta
and
don
t
want
to
do
anybody
harm
isn
t
one
to
get
one
s
goods
on
shore
where
one
likes
they
go
swaggering
about
a
lot
of
thieves
making
us
pay
double
for
every
handkerchief
that
we
want
to
land
and
nobody
shoots
them
added
ntoni
malavoglia
do
you
know
what
don
giammaria
said
that
to
rob
thieves
was
not
stealing
and
the
worst
of
thieves
are
those
fellows
in
uniform
who
eat
us
up
i
ll
mash
them
into
pulp
concluded
rocco
spatu
with
his
eyes
shining
like
a
cat
s
but
this
conversation
did
not
please
la
locca
s
son
at
all
and
he
set
his
glass
down
again
without
drinking
white
as
a
corpse
are
you
drunk
already
asked
cinghialenta
no
he
replied
i
did
not
come
into
the
open
air
it
will
do
us
all
good
one
moment
cried
pizzuti
with
the
door
in
his
hand
i
don
t
mean
for
the
money
for
the
bitters
that
i
have
given
you
freely
because
you
are
my
friends
but
listen
between
ourselves
eh
if
you
are
successful
mind
i
am
here
and
my
house
you
know
i
ve
a
room
at
the
back
big
enough
to
hold
a
of
goods
and
nobody
likely
to
think
of
it
for
don
michele
and
his
guards
are
with
me
i
don
t
trust
cousin
goosefoot
the
last
time
he
threw
me
over
and
put
everything
into
don
silvestro
s
house
don
silvestro
is
never
contented
with
a
reasonable
profit
but
asks
an
awful
price
on
the
ground
that
he
risks
his
place
but
i
have
no
such
motive
and
i
ask
no
more
than
is
reasonable
and
i
never
refused
goosefoot
his
percentage
either
and
give
him
his
drinks
free
and
shave
him
for
nothing
but
the
devil
take
him
if
he
plays
me
such
a
trick
again
i
ll
show
him
that
i
am
not
to
be
fooled
in
that
way
i
ll
go
to
don
michele
and
blow
the
whole
how
it
rains
said
spatu
isn
t
it
going
to
leave
off
with
this
weather
there
ll
be
no
one
at
the
rotolo
said
la
locca
s
son
wouldn
t
it
be
better
to
go
home
ntoni
rocco
and
cinghialenta
who
stood
on
the
listening
in
silence
to
the
rain
which
hissed
like
fish
in
the
stopped
a
moment
looking
into
the
darkness
be
still
you
fool
cried
cinghialenta
and
vanni
pizzuti
closed
the
door
softly
after
adding
in
an
undertone
listen
if
anything
happens
you
did
not
see
me
this
evening
the
bitters
i
gave
you
out
of
but
you
haven
t
been
in
my
house
don
t
betray
me
i
am
alone
in
the
the
others
went
off
surlily
close
to
the
wall
in
the
rain
and
that
one
too
muttered
cinghialenta
and
he
s
to
get
off
because
he
has
nobody
in
the
world
and
abuses
goosefoot
at
least
goosefoot
has
a
wife
and
i
have
a
wife
too
but
the
balls
are
good
enough
for
just
then
they
passed
very
softly
before
cousin
anna
s
closed
door
and
rocco
spatu
murmured
that
he
had
his
mother
too
who
was
at
that
moment
fast
asleep
luckily
for
her
whoever
can
stay
between
the
sheets
in
this
weather
isn
t
likely
to
be
about
certainly
concluded
cousin
cinghialenta
ntoni
signed
to
them
to
be
quiet
and
to
turn
down
by
the

without

why
she

but
pale
as

dead
and
better

if

instead
of

really
been
there
a
little
after

and

knocked

at

or

will
be
the
worse
for
lia
wept
silently
lest
her
sister
should
hear
her
with
her
face
hidden
in
her
hands
and
don
michele
watched
her
with
his
pistols
in
his
belt
and
his
trousers
thrust
into
his
boots
there
is
no
one
who
weeps
for

or

this
night
cousin

but
i

am
in
danger
like

think
how
i
came
to

and
how
i

risked
my
bread
for
you
more
than

lia
lifted
up
her
face
and
looked
at
don
michele
with
her
large
tearful
eyes
god

your
charity
don
michele
i
haven
t
done

the
love
i
bear
to

go
for
they

all
asleep

for
the
love
of

don
michele
and
don
michele
went
and
she
stayed
by
the
door
weeping
and
praying
that
god
would
send
her
brother
that
way
but
the
lord
did
not
send
him
that
way
all
four
of
them
ntoni
cinghialenta
rocco
spatu
and
the
son
of
la
locca
went
softly
along
the
wall
of
the
alley
and
when
they
came
out
upon
the
down
they
took
off
their
shoes
and
carried
them
in
their
hands
and
stood
still
to
listen
i
hear
nothing
said
cinghialenta
the
rain
continued
to
fall
and
from
the
top
of
the
cliff
nothing
could
be
heard
save
the
moaning
of
the
sea
below
one
can
t
even
see
to
swear
said
rocco
spatu
how
will
they
manage
to
climb
the
cliff
in
this
darkness
they
all
know
the
coast
foot
by
foot
with
their
eyes
shut
they
are
old
hands
replied
cinghialenta
but
i
hear
nothing
observed
ntoni
it
s
a
fact
we
can
hear
nothing
said
cinghialenta
but
they
must
have
been
there
below
for
some
then
we
had
better
go
home
said
the
son
of
la
locca
since
you
ve
eaten
and
drunk
you
think
of
nothing
but
getting
home
again
but
if
you
don
t
be
quiet
i
ll
kick
you
into
the
sea
said
cinghialenta
to
him
the
fact
is
said
rocco
that
i
find
it
a
bore
to
spend
the
night
here
doing
nothing
now
we
will
try
if
they
are
here
or
and
he
began
to
hoot
like
an
owl
if
don
michele
s
guard
hears
that
they
will
be
down
on
us
directly
for
on
these
wet
nights
the
owls
don
t
then
we
had
better
go
whined
la
locca
s
son
but
nobody
answered
him
all
four
looked
in
each
other
s
faces
though
they
could
see
nothing
and
thought
of
what
padron
ntoni
s
ntoni
had
just
said
what
shall
we
do
asked
la
locca
s
son
let
s
go
down
to
the
road
if
they
are
not
there
we
may
be
sure
they
have
not
come
suggested
cinghialenta
ntoni
while
they
were
climbing
down
said
goosefoot
is
capable
of
selling
the
lot
of
us
for
a
glass
of
now
you
haven
t
the
glass
before
you
you

afraid
said
cinghialenta
come
on
the
devil
take
you
i
ll
show
whether
i
m
while
they
were
feeling
their
way
cautiously
down
very
slowly
for
fear
of
breaking
their
necks
in
the
dark
spatu
observed
at
this
moment
vanni
pizzuti
is
safe
in
bed
and
he
complained
of
goosefoot
for
getting
his
percentage
for
well
said
cinghialenta
if
you
don
t
want
to
risk
your
lives
stay
at
home
and
go
to
ntoni
reaching
down
with
his
hands
to
feel
where
he
should
set
his
foot
could
not
help
thinking
that
master
cinghialenta
would
have
done
better
not
to
say
that
because
it
brought
to
each
the
image
of
his
house
and
his
bed
and
mena
dozing
behind
the
door
that
big
tipsy
brute
rocco
spatu
said
at
last
our
lives
are
not
worth
a
who
goes
there
they
heard
some
one
call
out
all
at
once
behind
the
wall
of
the
stop
stop
all
of
you
treachery
treachery
they
began
to
cry
out
rushing
off
over
the
cliffs
without
heeding
where
they
went
but
ntoni
who
had
already
climbed
over
the
wall
found
himself
face
to
face
with
don
michele
who
had
his
pistol
in
his
hand
blood
of
our
lady
cried
malavoglia
pulling
out
his
knife
i
ll
show
you
whether
i
m
afraid
of
your
pistol
don
michele
s
pistol
went
off
in
the
air
but
he
himself
fell
like
a
bull
stabbed
in
the
chest
ntoni
tried
to
escape
leaping
from
rock
to
rock
like
a
goat
but
the
guards
caught
up
with
him
while
the
balls
rattled
about
like
hail
and
threw
him
on
the
ground
now
what
will
become
of
my
mother
whined
la
locca
s
son
while
they
tied
him
up
like
a
trussed
chicken

tight
shouted
ntoni
don

i
can

once
for

they
answered
driving
him
before
them
with
the
butts
of
their
muskets
while
they
led
him
up
to
the
barracks
tied
up
like
our
lord
himself
and
worse
and
carried
don
michele
too
on
their
shoulders
he
looked
here
and
there
for
rocco
spatu
and
cinghialenta
they
have
got
off
he
said
to
himself
they
have
nothing
more
to
dread
but
are
as
safe
as
vanni
pizzuti
and
goosefoot
are
between
their
sheets
only
at
my
house
no
one
will
sleep
now
they
have
heard
the
in
fact
those
poor
things
did
not
sleep
but
stood
at
the
door
and
watched
in
the
rain
as
if
their
hearts
had
told
them
what
had
happened
while
the
neighbors
hearing
the
shots
turned
sleepily
over
in
their
beds
and
muttered
yawning
we
shall
know
what
has
very
late
when
the
day
was
breaking
a
crowd
gathered
in
front
of
vanni
pizzuti
s
shop
where
the
light
was
burning
and
there
was
a
great
chattering
they
have
caught
the
smuggled
goods
and
the
smugglers
too
recounted
pizzuti
and
don
michele
has
been
people
looked
at
the
malavoglia
s
door
and
pointed
with
their
fingers
at
last
came
their
cousin
anna
with
her
hair
loose
white
as
a
sheet
and
knew
not
what
to
say
padron
ntoni
as
if
he
knew
what
was
coming
asked
ntoni
where
s
ntoni
he
s
been
caught
smuggling
he
was
arrested
last
night
with
la
locca
s
son
replied
poor
cousin
anna
who
had
fairly
lost
her
head
and
they
have
killed
don
holy
mother
cried
the
old
man
with
his
hands
to
his
head
and
lia
too
was
tearing
her
hair
padron
ntoni
holding
his
head
with
both
hands
went
on
repeating
ah
mother
ah

mother
later
on
goosefoot
came
with
a
face
full
of
trouble
smiting
his
forehead
oh

ntoni
have
you
heard
what
a
misfortune
i
felt
like
a

when

cried
poor
woman
for
her
heart
ached
to
see
how
misfortunes
rained
upon
those
poor
malavoglia
what
are
you
doing
here
asked
her
husband
under
his
breath
drawing
her
away
from
the
window
it
is
no
business
of
yours
now
it
isn
t
safe
to
come
to
this
house
one
might
get
mixed
up
in
some
scrape
with
the
for
which
reason
nobody
came
near
the
malavoglia
s
door
only
nunziata
as
soon
as
she
heard
of
their
trouble
had
confided
the
little
ones
to
their
eldest
brother
and
her
house
door
to
her
next
neighbor
and
went
off
to
her
friend
mena
to
weep
with
her
but
then
she
was
still
such
a
child
the
others
stood
afar
off
in
the
street
staring
or
went
to
the
barracks
crowding
like
flies
to
see
how
padron
ntoni
s
ntoni
looked
behind
the
grating
after
having
stabbed
don
michele
or
else
they
filled
pizzuti
s
shop
where
he
sold
bitters
and
was
always
shaving
somebody
while
he
told
the
whole
story
of
the
night
before

cried
the
druggist
the
fools
to

up
close
to

in

of

thrust
themselves
into
one

house
by
force

break

always
some
scamp
like
la
locca
s
son
or
malavoglia
who
won
t
do
any
honest
and
they
all
said
yes
that
if
any
one
had
such
a
son
as
that
it
was
better
that
the
house
should
fall
on
him
only
la

went
in
search
of
her
son
and
stood
screaming
in
front
of
the
barracks
of
the
guards
saying
that
she
would
have
him
and
not
listening
to

and
when

her

and
planted

at

that

take
her
in
at

and
she

reap

padron

added
and
it
is
a
good
thing
for
padron
ntoni
too
do
you
think
that
grandson
of
his
did
not
cost
him
a
lot
of
money
i
know
what
it
is
to
have
a
son
like
that
now
the
king
must
maintain
but
padron
ntoni
instead
of
thinking
of
saving
those
soldi
now
that
his
grandson
was
no
longer
likely
to
spend
them
for
him
kept
on
flinging
them
after
him
with
lawyers
and
notaries
and
the
rest
of
it
those
soldi
which
had
cost
so
much
labor
and
had
been
destined
for
the
house
by
the
now
we
do
not
need
the
house
nor
anything
else
said
he
with
a
face
as
pale
as
ntoni
s
own
when
they
had
taken
him
away
to
town
with
his
hands
tied
and
under
his
arm
the
little
bundle
of
shirts
which
mena
had
brought
to
him
with
so
many
tears
at
night
when
no
one
saw
her
the
whole
town
went
to
see
him
go
in
the
middle
of
the
police
his
grandfather
had
gone
off
to
the
advocate
the
one
who
talked
so
much
for
since
he
had
seen
don
michele
also
pass
by
in
the
carriage
on
his
way
to
the
hospital
as
yellow
as
a
guinea
and
with
his
uniform
unbuttoned
he
was
frightened
poor
old
man
and
did
not
stop
to
find
fault
with
the
lawyer
s
chatter
as
long
as
he
would
promise
to
untie
his
grandson
s
hands
and
let
him
come
home
again
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
after
this
earthquake
ntoni
would
come
home
again
and
stay
with
them
always
as
he
had
done
when
he
was
a
child
don
silvestro
had
done
him
the
kindness
to
go
with
him
to
the
lawyer
because
he
said
that
when
such
a
misfortune
as
had
happened
to
the
malavoglia
happened
to
any
christian
one
should
aid
one
s
neighbor
with
hands
and
feet
too
even
if
it
were
a
wretch
fit
only
for
the
galleys
and
do
one
s
best
to
take
him
out
of
the
hands
of
justice
for
that
was
why
we
were
christians
that
we
should
help
our
neighbors
when
they
need
it
the
advocate
when
he
had
heard
the
story
and
it
had
been
explained
to
him
by
don
silvestro
said
that
it
was
a
very
good
case
a
case
for
the
galleys
certainly
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
if
they
hadn
t
come
to
padron
ntoni
turned
as
white
as
a
sheet
when
he
heard
of
the
galleys
but
the
advocate
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
told
him
not
to
be
frightened
that
he
was
no
lawyer
if
he
couldn
t
get
him
off
with
four
or
five
years
imprisonment
what
did
the
advocate
say
asked
mena
as
she
saw
her
grandfather
return
with
that
pale
face
and
began
to
cry
before
she
could
hear
the
answer
the
old
man
walked
up
and
down
the
house
like
a
madman
saying
ah
why
did
we
not
all
die
first
lia
white
as
her
smock
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
wide
dry
eyes
unable
to
speak
a
word
a
little
while
after
came
the
summonses
as
witnesses
to
barbara
zuppidda
and
grazia
goosefoot
and
don
franco
the
druggist
and
all
those
who
were
wont
to
stand
chattering
in
his
shop
and
in
that
of
vanni
pizzuti
the
barber
so
that
the
whole
place
was
upset
by
them
and
the
people
crowded
the
piazza
with
the
stamped
papers
in
their
hands
and
swore
that
they
knew
nothing
about
it
as
true
as
god
was
in
heaven
because
they
did
not
want
to
get
mixed
up
with
the
tribunals
cursed
be
ntoni
and
all
the
malavoglia
who
pulled
them
by
the
hair
into
their
scrapes
the
zuppidda
screamed
as
if
she
had
been
possessed
i
know
nothing
about
it
at
the
ave
maria
i
shut
myself
into
my
house
and
i
am
not
like
those
who
go
wandering
about
after
such
work
as
we
know
of
or
who
stand
at
the
doors
to
talk
with
beware
of
the
government
added
don
franco
they
know
that
i
am
a
republican
and
they
would
be
very
glad
to
get
a
chance
to
sweep
me
off
the
face
of
the
everybody
beat
their
brains
to
find
out
what
the
zuppidda
and
cousin
grace
and
the
rest
of
them
could
have
to
say
as
witnesses
on
the
trial
for
they
had
seen
nothing
and
had
only
heard
the
shots
when
they
were
in
bed
between
sleeping
and
waking
but
don
silvestro
rubbed
his
hands
like
the
lawyer
and
said
that
he
knew
because
he
had
pointed
them
out
to
the
lawyer
and
that
it
was
much
better
for
the
lawyer
that
he
had
every
time
that
the
lawyer
went
to
talk
with
ntoni
malavoglia
don
silvestro
went
with
him
to
the
prison
if
he
had
nothing
else
to
do
and
nobody
went
at
that
time
to
the
council
and
the
olives
were
gathered
padron
ntoni
had
also
tried
to
go
two
or
three
times
but
whenever
he
got
in
front
of
those
barred
windows
and
the
soldiers
who
were
on
guard
before
them
he
turned
sick
and
faint
and
stayed
waiting
for
them
outside
sitting
on
the
pavement
among
the
people
who
sold
chestnuts
and
indian
figs
it
did
not
seem
possible
to
him
that
his
ntoni
could
really
be
there
behind
those
grated
windows
with
the
soldiers
guarding
him
the
lawyer
came
back
from
talking
with
ntoni
fresh
as
a
rose
rubbing
his
hands
and
saying
that
his
grandson
was
quite
well
indeed
that
he
was
growing
fat
then
it
seemed
to
the
poor
old
man
that
his
grandson
was
with
the
soldiers
why
don
t
they
let
him
go
he
asked
over
and
over
again
like
a
parrot
or
like
a
child
and
kept
on
asking
too
if
his
hands
were
always
tied
leave
him
where
he
is
said
doctor
scipione
in
these
cases
it
is
better
to
let
some
time
pass
first
meanwhile
he
wants
for
nothing
as
i
told
you
and
is
growing
quite
fat
things
are
going
very
well
don
michele
has
nearly
recovered
from
his
wound
and
that
also
is
a
very
good
thing
for
us
go
back
to
your
boat
i
tell
you
this
is
my
but
i
can
t
go
back
to
the
boat
now
ntoni
is
in
prison
i
can
t
go
back
everybody
looks
at
me
when
i
pass
and
besides
my
head
isn
t
right
with
ntoni
in
and
he
went
on
repeating
the
same
thing
while
the
money
ran
away
like
water
and
all
his
people
stayed
in
the
house
as
if
they
were
hiding
and
never
opened
the
door
at
last
the
day
of
trial
arrived
and
those
who
had
been
summoned
as
witnesses
had
to
go
on
their
own
feet
if
they
did
not
wish
to
be
carried
by
force
by
the
carbineers
even
don
franco
went
and
changed
his
ugly
hat
to
appear
before
the
majesty
of
justice
to
better
advantage
but
he
was
as
pale
as
ntoni
malavoglia
himself
who
stood
inside
the
bars
like
a
wild
beast
with
the
carbineers
on
each
side
of
him
don
franco
had
never
before
had
anything
to
do
with
the
law
and
he
trembled
all
over
at
the
idea
of
going
into
the
midst
of
all
those
judges
and
spies
and
policemen
who
would
catch
a
man
and
put
him
in
there
behind
the
bars
like
ntoni
malavoglia
before
he
could
wink
the
whole
village
had
gone
out
to
see
what
kind
of
a
figure
padron
ntoni
s
ntoni
would
make
behind
the
bars
in
the
middle
of
the
carbineers
yellow
as
a
not
daring
to
look
up
for
fear
of
seeing
all
those
eyes
of
friends
and
acquaintances
fixed
upon
him
turning
his
cap
over
and
over
in
his
hands
while
the
president
in
his
long
black
robe
and
with
napkin
under
his
chin
went
on
reading
a
long
list
of
the
iniquities
which
he
had
committed
from
the
paper
where
they
were
written
down
in
black
and
white
don
michele
was
there
too
also
looking
yellow
and
ill
sitting
in
a
chair
opposite
to
the
jews
as
they
would
call
the
jury
who
kept
on
yawning
and
fanning
themselves
with
their
handkerchiefs
meanwhile
the
advocate
kept
on
chatting
with
his
next
neighbor
as
if
the
affair
were
no
concern
of
his
this
time
murmured
the
zuppidda
in
the
ear
of
the
person
next
her
listening
to
all
those
awful
things
that
ntoni
had
done
he
certainly
won
t
get
off
the
santuzza
was
there
too
to
say
where
ntoni
had
been
and
how
he
had
passed
that
evening
now
i
wonder
what
they
ll
ask
santuzza
murmured
the
zuppidda
i
can
t
think
how
she
ll
answer
so
as
not
to
bring
out
all
her
own
but
what
is
it
they
want
of
us
asked
cousin
grazia
they
want
to
know
if
it
is
true
that
don
michele
had
an
understanding
with
lia
and
if
ntoni
did
not
stab
him
because
of
that
the
advocate
told
confound
you
whispered
the
druggist
furiously
do
you
all
want
to
go
to
the
galleys
don
t
you
know
that
before
the
law
you
must
always
say
no
and
that
we
know
nothing
at
all
cousin
venera
wrapped
herself
in
her
mantle
but
went
on
muttering
it
is
the
truth
i
saw
them
with
my
own
eyes
and
all
the
town
knows
that
morning
at
the
malavoglia
s
house
there
had
been
a
terrible
scene
when
the
grandfather
seeing
the
whole
place
go
off
to
see
ntoni
tried
started
to
go
after
them
lia
with
tumbled
hair
wild
eyes
and
her
chin
trembling
like
a
baby
s
wanted
to
go
too
and
went
about
the
house
looking
for
her
mantle
without
speaking
but
with
pale
face
and
trembling
hands
mena
caught
her
by
those
hands
saying
pale
as
death
herself
no
you
must
not
go
you
must
not
go
and
nothing
else
the
grandfather
added
that
they
must
stay
at
home
and
pray
to
the
madonna
and
they
wept
so
that
they
were
heard
all
the
length
of
the
black
street
the
poor
old
man
had
hardly
reached
the
town
when
hidden
at
a
corner
he
saw
his
grandson
pass
among
the
carbineers
and
with
trembling
limbs
went
to
sit
on
the
steps
of
the
where
every
one
passed
him
going
up
and
down
on
his
business
then
it
came
over
him
that
all
those
people
were
going
to
hear
his
grandson
condemned
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
were
leaving
him
alone
in
the
piazza
surrounded
by
enemies
or
out
at
sea
in
a
hurricane
and
so
he
too
amid
the
crowd
went
up
the
stairs
and
strove
by
rising
on
his
tiptoes
to
see
through
the
grating
and
past
the
shining
bayonets
of
the
carbineers
ntoni
however
he
could
not
see
surrounded
as
he
was
by
such
a
crowd
of
people
and
more
than
ever
it
seemed
to
the
poor
old
man
that
his
grandson
was
one
of
the
soldiers
meanwhile
the
advocate
talked
and
talked
and
talked
until
it
seemed
that
his
flood
of
words
ran
like
the
pulley
of
a
well
up
and
down
up
and
down
without
ceasing
no
he
said
no
it
was
not
true
that
ntoni
malavoglia
had
been
guilty
of
all
those
crimes
the
president
had
gone
about
raking
up
all
sorts
of
stories
that
was
his
business
and
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
get
poor
helpless
fellows
into
scrapes
but
after
all
what
did
the
president
know
about
it
had
he
been
there
that
rainy
night
in
the
pitch
darkness
to
see
what
ntoni
malavoglia
was
about
in
the
poor
man
s
house
he
alone
is
in
the
wrong
and
the
gallows
is
for
the
the
president
went
on
looking
at
him
calmly
with
his
leaning
his
elbows
on
his
papers
doctor
scipione
went
on
asking
where
were
the
goods
who
had
seen
the
goods
that
was
what
he
wanted
to
know
and
since
how
long
had
honest
men
been
forbidden
to
walk
about
at
whatever
hour
they
liked
especially
when
they
had
a
little
too
much
wine
in
their
heads
to
get
rid
of
padron
ntoni
nodded
his
head
at
this
or
said
yes
yes
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
would
have
liked
to
hug
the
advocate
who
had
called
ntoni
a
blockhead
suddenly
he
lifted
his
head
that
was
good
what
the
lawyer
had
just
said
was
worth
of
itself
fifty
francs
he
said
that
since
they
wanted
to
drive
them
to
the
wall
and
to
prove
plain
as
two
and
two
make
four
that
they
had
caught
ntoni
malavoglia
in
the
act
with
the
knife
in
his
hand
and
had
brought
don
michele
there
before
them
with
his
stupid
face
well
then
how
are
you
to
prove
that
it
was
ntoni
malavoglia
who
stabbed
him
who
knows
that
it
was
he
who
can
tell
that
don
michele
didn
t
stab
himself
on
purpose
to
send
ntoni
malavoglia
to
the
galleys
do
you
really
want
to
know
the
truth
smuggled
goods
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
between
ntoni
malavoglia
and
don
michele
there
was
an
old
quarrel
a
quarrel
about
a
and
padron
ntoni
nodded
again
in
assent
for
didn
t
everybody
know
and
wasn
t
he
ready
to
swear
before
the
crucifix
too
that
don
michele
was
furious
with
jealousy
of
ntoni
since
santuzza
had
taken
a
fancy
to
him
and
then
meeting
don
michele
by
night
and
after
the
boy
had
been
drinking
too
one
knows
how
it
is
when
one
s
eyes
are
clouded
with
drink
the
advocate
continued
you
may
ask
the
zuppidda
and
dame
grazia
and
a
dozen
more
witnesses
if
it
is
not
true
that
don
michele
had
an
understanding
with
lia
ntoni
malavoglia
s
sister
and
he
was
always
prowling
about
the
black
street
in
the
evening
after
the
girl
they
saw
him
there
the
very
night
on
which
he
was
padron
ntoni
heard
no
more
for
his
ears
began
to
ring
and
at
that
moment
he
caught
sight
of
ntoni
who
had
sprung
up
behind
the
bars
tearing
his
cap
like
a
madman
and
shaking
his
head
violently
with
flashing
eyes
and
trying
to
make
himself
heard
the
took
the
old
man
out
supposing
that
he
had
had
a
stroke
and
the
guards
laid
him
on
a
bench
in
the
witnesses
room
and
threw
water
in
his
face
later
while
they
were
taking
him
tottering
and
clinging
to
their
arms
the
crowd
came
pouring
out
like
a
torrent
and
they
were
heard
to
say
they
have
condemned
him
to
five
years
in
at
that
moment
ntoni
came
out
himself
deadly
pale
handcuffed
in
the
midst
of
the
carbineers
cousin
grazia
went
off
home
running
and
reached
there
sooner
than
the
others
panting
with
speed
for
ill
news
always
comes
on
wings
hardly
had
she
caught
sight
of
lia
who
stood
waiting
at
the
door
like
a
soul
in
purgatory
than
she
caught
her
by
both
hands
exclaiming
wretched
girl
what
have
you
done
they
have
told
the
judge
that
you
had
an
understanding
with
don
michele
and
your
grandfather
had
a
stroke
when
he
heard
lia
answered
not
a
word
any
more
than
if
she
had
not
heard
or
did
not
care
she
only
stared
with
wide
eyes
and
open
mouth
at
last
she
sank
slowly
down
upon
a
chair
as
if
she
had
lost
the
use
of
her
limbs
so
she
remained
for
many
minutes
without
motion
or
speech
while
cousin
grazia
threw
water
in
her
face
until
she
began
to
stammer
i
can
t
stay
here
i
must
go
i
must
go
away
her
sister
followed
her
about
the
room
weeping
and
trying
to
catch
her
by
the
hands
while
she
went
on
saying
to
the
cupboard
and
to
the
chairs
like
a
mad
creature
i
must
go
in
the
evening
when
her
grandfather
was
brought
home
on
a
cart
and
mena
careless
now
whether
she
were
seen
or
not
went
out
to
meet
him
lia
went
first
into
the
court
and
then
into
the
street
and
then
went
away
altogether
and
nobody
ever
saw
her
any
more
xv
said
that
lia
was
gone
to
live
with
don
michele
that
the
malavoglia
after
all
had
nothing
left
to
lose
and
don
michele
would
give
her
bread
to
eat
padron
ntoni
was
of
no
use
to
anybody
any
more
he
did
nothing
but
wander
about
bent
almost
double
and
uttering
at
intervals
proverbs
without
sense
or
meaning
like
a
hatchet
for
the
fallen
tree
who
falls
in
the
water
gets
wet
the
thinnest
horse
has
the
most
flies
and
when
they
asked
him
why
he
was
always
wandering
about
he
said
hunger
drives
the
wolf
out
of
the
wood
or
the
hungry
dog
fears
not
the
stick
but
no
one
asked
how
he
was
or
seemed
to
care
about
him
now
he
was
reduced
to
such
a
condition
they
teased
him
and
asked
him
why
he
stood
waiting
with
his
back
against
the
like
uncle
crucifix
when
he
had
money
to
lend
or
sitting
under
the
boats
which
were
drawn
up
on
the
sand
as
if
he
had
padron
fortunato
s
bark
out
at
sea
and
padron
ntoni
replied
that
he
was
waiting
for
death
who
would
not
come
to
take
him
for
long
are
the
days
of
the
no
one
in
the
house
ever
spoke
of
lia
not
even
sant
agata
who
if
she
wished
to
relieve
her
feelings
went
and
wept
beside
her
mother
s
bed
when
she
was
alone
in
the
house
now
this
house
too
had
become
as
wide
as
the
sea
and
they
were
lost
in
it
the
money
was
gone
with
ntoni
alessio
was
always
away
here
or
there
at
work
and
nunziata
used
to
be
charitable
enough
to
come
and
kindle
the
fire
when
mena
used
to
have
to
go
out
towards
evening
and
lead
her
grandfather
home
in
the
dusk
because
he
was
half
blind
don
silvestro
and
others
in
the
place
said
that
alessio
would
do
better
to
send
his
grandfather
to
the
now
that
he
was
of
no
more
use
to
anybody
but
that
was
the
only
thing
that
frightened
the
poor
old
fellow
every
time
that
mena
led
him
out
by
the
hand
in
the
morning
to
take
him
where
the
sun
shone
to
wait
for
death
he
thought
that
they
were
leading
him
to
the
so
silly
was
he
grown
and
he
went
on
stammering
but
will
death
never
come
so
that
some
people
used
to
ask
him
laughing
where
he
thought
death
had
gone
alessio
came
back
every
saturday
night
and
brought
all
his
money
and
counted
it
out
to
his
grandfather
as
if
he
had
still
been
reasonable
he
always
replied
yes
yes
and
nodded
his
head
and
they
always
had
to
hide
the
little
sum
under
the
mattress
in
the
old
place
and
told
him
to
please
him
that
they
were
putting
it
away
to
buy
back
the
house
by
the
and
that
in
a
year
or
two
they
should
have
enough
but
then
the
old
man
shook
his
head
obstinately
and
replied
that
now
they
did
not
need
the
house
and
that
it
would
have
been
better
if
there
had
never
been
the
house
of
the
malavoglia
now
that
the
malavoglia
were
all
scattered
here
and
there
once
he
called
nunziata
aside
under
the
when
no
one
was
by
and
seemed
to
be
anxious
to
say
something
very
important
but
he
moved
his
lips
without
speaking
and
seemed
to
be
seeking
for
words
looking
from
side
to
side
is
it
true
what
they
say
about
lia
he
said
at
last
no
replied
nunziata
crossing
her
hands
on
her
breast
no
by
the
madonna
of
ognino
it
is
not
true
he
began
to
shake
his
head
with
his
chin
sunk
on
his
breast
then
why
has
she
run
away
too
why
has
she
run
away
and
he
went
about
the
house
looking
for
her
pretending
to
have
lost
his
cap
touching
the
bed
and
the
cupboard
and
sitting
down
at
the
loom
without
speaking
do
you
know
he
asked
after
a
while
do
you
know
where
she
is
gone
but
to
mena
he
said
nothing
nunziata
really
did
not
know
where
she
was
nor
did
any
one
else
in
the
place
one
evening
there
came
and
stopped
in
the
black
street
alfio
mosca
with
the
cart
to
which
was
now
harnessed
a
mule
and
he
had
had
the
fever
at
bicocca
and
had
nearly
died
so
that
his
face
was
yellow
as
saffron
and
he
had
lost
his
fine
straight
figure
but
the
mule
was
fat
and
shining
do
you
remember
when
i
went
away
to
bicocca
when
you
were
still
in
the
house
by
the
medlar
he
asked
now
everything
is
changed
for
the
world
is
round
some
swim
and
some
are
this
time
they
had
not
even
a
glass
of
wine
to
offer
him
in
welcome
cousin
alfio
knew
where
lia
was
he
had
seen
her
with
his
own
eyes
looking
just
as
cousin
mena
used
to
when
she
used
to
come
to
her
window
and
he
talked
to
her
from
his
for
which
reason
he
sat
still
looking
from
one
thing
to
another
looking
at
the
furniture
and
at
the
walls
and
feeling
as
if
the
loaded
cart
were
lying
on
his
breast
while
he
sat
without
speaking
beside
the
empty
table
to
which
they
no
longer
sat
down
to
eat
the
evening
meal
now
i
must
go
he
repeated
finding
that
no
one
spoke
to
him
when
one
has
left
one
s
home
it
is
better
never
to
come
back
for
everything
changes
while
one
is
away
and
even
the
faces
that
meet
one
are
changed
so
that
one
feels
like
a
mena
continued
silent
meanwhile
alessio
began
to
tell
him
how
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
nunziata
as
soon
as
he
had
put
together
a
little
money
and
alfio
replied
that
he
was
quite
right
if
nunziata
had
also
saved
a
little
money
for
that
she
was
a
good
girl
and
everybody
knew
her
in
the
place
so
even
do
our
nearest
and
dearest
forget
us
when
we
are
no
longer
here
and
each
thinks
of
his
own
affairs
and
of
bearing
the
burden
which
god
has
given
him
like
alfio
mosca
s
ass
poor
beast
who
was
sold
and
gone
no
one
knew
where
nunziata
had
her
own
dowry
by
this
time
for
her
brothers
were
growing
big
enough
to
earn
their
own
bread
and
even
to
put
by
now
and
then
a
soldo
and
she
had
never
bought
jewellery
or
good
clothes
for
herself
for
she
said
gold
was
for
rich
people
and
white
clothes
it
was
nonsense
to
buy
while
she
was
still
growing
by
this
time
she
was
grown
up
a
tall
slight
girl
with
black
hair
and
deep
sweet
eyes
that
had
never
lost
the
look
they
wore
when
she
found
herself
deserted
by
her
father
with
all
her
little
brothers
on
her
hands
whom
she
had
reared
through
all
those
years
of
care
and
trouble
seeing
how
she
had
pulled
through
all
these
troubles
she
and
her
little
brothers
and
she
a
slip
of
a
thing
no
bigger
than
the
every
one
was
glad
to
speak
to
her
and
to
notice
her
if
they
met
her
in
the
street
the
money
we
have
she
said
to
cousin
alfio
who
was
almost
like
a
relation
they
had
known
him
so
long
at
all
saints
my
eldest
brother
is
going
to
master
filippo
as
hired
man
and
the
second
to
padron
cipolla
in
his
place
when
we
have
found
a
place
for
turi
i
shall
marry
but
i
must
wait
until
i
am
older
and
my
father
gives
his
but
your
father
doesn
t
even
think
whether
you
are
alive
or
dead
said
alfio
if
he
were
to
come
back
now
said
nunziata
calmly
in
her
sweet
voice
sitting
quietly
with
her
hands
on
her
knees
he
would
stay
because
now
we
have
some
then
cousin
alfio
repeated
to
alessio
that
he
would
do
well
to
marry
nunziata
now
that
she
had
money
we
shall
buy
back
the
house
by
the
medlar
added
alessio
and
grandfather
will
live
with
us
when
the
others
come
back
they
will
live
there
too
and
if
nunziata
s
father
comes
there
will
also
be
room
for
no
one
spoke
of
lia
but
they
all
thought
of
her
as
they
sat
with
arms
on
their
knees
looking
into
the
moonlight
finally
cousin
mosca
got
up
to
go
because
his
mule
shook
his
bells
impatiently
almost
as
if
he
had
known
who
it
was
whom
cousin
alfio
had
met
and
whom
they
did
not
expect
at
the
house
by
the
uncle
crucifix
expected
that
the
malavoglia
would
come
to
him
about
that
house
by
the
medlar
which
had
been
lying
all
this
time
on
his
hands
as
if
nobody
cared
to
have
it
so
that
he
had
no
sooner
heard
that
alfio
mosca
was
come
back
to
the
place
than
he
went
after
him
to
ask
him
to
speak
to
the
malavoglia
and
induce
them
to
settle
the
affair
forgetting
apparently
that
he
had
been
so
jealous
of
alfio
mosca
when
he
went
away
that
he
had
wished
to
break
his
ribs
with
a
big
stick
listen
cousin
alfio
said
if
you
ll
arrange
that
affair
of
the
house
with
the
malavoglia
when
they
have
the
money
i
ll
give
you
enough
to
pay
for
the
shoes
you
ll
wear
out
going
between
cousin
alfio
went
to
speak
to
the
malavoglia
but
padron
ntoni
shook
his
head
and
said
no
now
we
should
not
know
what
to
do
with
the
house
for
mena
is
not
likely
to
marry
and
there
are
no
malavoglia
left
i
am
still
here
because
the
afflicted
have
long
lives
but
when
i
am
gone
alessio
will
marry
nunziata
and
they
will
go
away
from
the
he
too
was
going
away
the
greater
part
of
the
time
he
passed
in
bed
like
a
crab
under
the
pebbles
crying
out
with
pain
what
have
i
to
do
here
he
stammered
and
he
felt
as
if
he
was
robbing
them
of
the
food
they
gave
him
in
vain
did
mena
and
alessio
seek
to
persuade
him
otherwise
he
repeated
that
he
was
robbing
them
of
their
food
and
of
their
time
and
made
them
count
the
money
hidden
under
the
mattress
and
if
it
grew
less
he
muttered
at
least
if
i
were
not
here
you
would
not
need
to
spend
so
much
there
is
nothing
left
for
me
to
do
here
and
it
is
time
i
was
the
doctor
who
came
to
feel
his
pulse
said
that
it
was
better
they
should
take
him
to
the
hospital
for
where
he
was
he
wore
out
his
own
life
and
theirs
too
to
no
purpose
meanwhile
the
poor
old
man
looked
from
one
to
the
other
trying
to
guess
what
was
said
with
sad
faded
eyes
trembling
lest
they
should
send
him
to
the
alessio
would
not
hear
of
sending
him
to
the
and
said
that
while
there
was
bread
for
any
of
them
there
was
for
all
and
mena
for
her
part
also
said
no
and
took
him
out
into
the
sun
on
fine
days
and
sat
down
by
him
with
her
distaff
telling
him
stories
as
she
would
have
done
to
a
child
and
spinning
when
she
was
not
obliged
to
go
to
she
talked
to
him
also
of
what
they
would
do
if
any
little
providential
fortune
were
to
happen
to
them
to
comfort
him
telling
him
how
they
would
buy
a
calf
at
saint
sebastian
and
how
she
would
be
able
to
cut
grass
enough
to
feed
it
through
the
winter
in
may
they
would
sell
it
again
at
a
profit
and
she
showed
him
the
brood
of
chickens
she
had
and
how
they
came
picking
about
their
feet
as
they
sat
in
the
sun
and
rolling
in
the
dust
of
the
street
with
the
money
they
would
get
for
the
chickens
they
would
buy
a
pig
so
as
not
to
lose
the
or
the
water
in
which
the
macaroni
had
been
boiled
and
at
the
end
of
the
year
it
would
be
as
if
they
had
been
putting
money
in
a
the
old
man
with
his
hands
on
his
stick
gave
approving
nods
looking
at
the
chickens
he
listened
so
attentively
that
at
last
he
got
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
they
had
got
back
the
house
by
the
medlar
they
could
have
kept
the
pig
in
the
court
and
that
it
would
bring
a
certain
profit
with
cousin
naso
at
the
house
by
the
there
was
also
the
stable
for
the
calf
and
the
shed
for
the
hay
and
everything
he
went
on
recalling
one
thing
after
another
looking
about
him
with
sunken
eyes
and
his
chin
upon
his
stick
then
he
would
ask
his
granddaughter
under
his
breath
what
was
it
the
doctor
said
about
the
hospital
and
mena
would
scold
him
as
if
he
were
a
child
saying
to
him
why
do
you
think
about
such
things
he
was
silent
and
listened
quietly
to
all
she
said
but
then
he
repeated
don
t
send
me
to
the
hospital
i
m
not
used
to
at
last
he
ceased
to
get
out
of
bed
and
the
doctor
said
that
it
was
all
over
with
him
and
that
he
could
do
no
more
but
that
he
might
live
like
that
for
years
and
that
alessio
and
mena
and
too
would
have
to
give
up
their
day
s
work
to
take
care
of
him
for
that
if
there
were
not
some
one
near
him
the
pigs
might
eat
him
up
if
the
door
were
left
open
padron
ntoni
understood
quite
well
what
was
said
for
he
looked
at
their
faces
one
after
another
with
eyes
that
it
would
break
one
s
heart
to
see
and
the
doctor
was
still
standing
on
the
with
mena
who
was
weeping
and
alessio
who
said
no
and
stamped
and
stormed
when
he
signed
to
nunziata
to
come
near
him
and
whispered
to
her
it
will
be
better
to
send
me
to
the
hospital
here
i
am
eating
them
out
of
house
and
home
send
me
away
some
day
when
mena
and
alessio
are
gone
out
they
say
no
because
they
have
the
good
heart
of
the
malavoglia
but
i
am
eating
up
the
money
which
should
be
put
away
for
the
house
and
then
the
doctor
said
that
i
might
live
like
this
for
years
and
there
is
nothing
here
for
me
to
do
but
i
don
t
want
to
live
for
years
down
there
at
the
nunziata
began
to
cry
and
she
also
said
no
until
all
the
neighborhood
cried
out
upon
them
for
being
proud
when
they
hadn
t
bread
to
eat
they
ashamed
to
send
their
grandfather
to
the
hospital
when
the
rest
were
scattered
about
here
and
there
and
in
such
places
too
so
it
went
on
over
and
over
and
the
doctor
kept
on
saying
that
it
was
of
no
use
his
coming
and
going
for
nothing
and
when
the
gossips
came
to
stand
round
the
old
man
s
bed
cousin
grazia
or
anna
or
nunziata
he
went
on
saying
that
the
fleas
were
eating
him
up
padron
ntoni
did
not
dare
to
open
his
mouth
but
lay
there
still
worn
and
pale
and
as
the
gossips
went
on
talking
among
themselves
and
even
nunziata
could
not
answer
them
one
day
when
alessio
was
not
there
he
said
at
last
go
and
call
cousin
alfio
mosca
that
he
may
do
me
the
charity
to
carry
me
to
the
hospital
in
his
so
padron
ntoni
went
away
to
the
hospital
in
alfio
mosca
s
cart
they
had
put
the
mattress
and
pillows
in
it
but
the
poor
sick
man
although
he
said
nothing
looked
long
at
everything
while
they
carried
him
to
the
cart
one
day
when
alessio
was
gone
to
riposto
and
they
had
sent
mena
away
on
some
pretext
or
they
would
not
have
let
him
go
in
the
black
street
when
they
passed
before
the
house
by
the
and
while
they
were
crossing
the
piazza
padron
ntoni
continued
to
look
about
him
as
if
to
fix
everything
in
his
memory
alfio
led
the
mule
on
one
side
and
nunziata
who
had
left
turi
in
charge
of
the
calf
the
turkeys
and
the
fowls
walked
on
the
other
side
with
the
bundle
of
shirts
under
her
arm
seeing
the
cart
pass
every
one
came
out
to
look
at
it
and
watched
it
until
it
was
out
of
sight
and
don
silvestro
said
that
they
had
done
quite
right
and
that
it
was
for
that
the
commune
paid
the
rate
for
the
hospital
and
don
franco
would
also
have
made
his
little
speech
if
don
silvestro
had
not
been
there
at
least
that
poor
devil
will
be
left
in
peace
said
uncle
crucifix
necessity
abases
nobility
said
padron
cipolla
and
santuzza
repeated
an
ave
maria
for
the
poor
old
man
only
the
cousin
anna
and
cousin
grace
goosefoot
wiped
their
eyes
with
their
aprons
as
the
cart
moved
slowly
away
jolting
on
the
stones
but
uncle
tino
chid
his
wife
what
are
you
whining
about
am
i
dead
what
is
it
to
you
alfio
mosca
as
he
guided
the
cart
related
to
nunziata
how
and
where
he
had
seen
lia
who
was
the
image
of
sant
agata
and
he
even
yet
could
hardly
believe
that
he
had
really
seen
her
and
his
voice
was
almost
lost
as
he
spoke
of
it
to
while
the
time
as
they
walked
along
the
dusty
road
ah
nunziata
who
would
have
thought
it
when
we
used
to
talk
to
each
other
from
the
doors
and
the
moon
shone
and
we
heard
the
neighbors
talking
in
front
and
sant
agata
s
loom
was
going
all
day
long
and
those
hens
that
knew
her
as
soon
as
she
opened
the
door
and
la
longa
who
called
her
from
the
court
and
everything
could
be
heard
in
my
house
as
plainly
as
in
theirs
poor
longa
see
now
that
i
have
my
mule
and
everything
just
as
i
wished
and
i
wouldn
t
have
believed
it
would
have
happened
if
an
angel
had
told
me
now
i
am
always
thinking
of
those
old
times
and
the
evenings
when
i
heard
all
your
voices
when
i
was
stabling
my
donkey
and
saw
the
light
in
the
house
by
the
medlar
which
is
now
shut
up
and
how
when
i
came
back
i
found
nothing
as
i
left
it
and
cousin
mena
so
changed
when
one
leaves
one
s
own
place
it
is
better
never
to
come
back
see
i
keep
thinking
too
about
that
poor
donkey
that
worked
for
me
so
long
and
went
on
always
rain
or
shine
with
his
bent
head
and
his
long
ears
now
who
knows
where
they
drive
him
by
what
rough
ways
or
with
what
heavy
loads
and
how
his
ears
hang
down
lower
than
ever
and
he
snuffs
at
the
earth
which
will
soon
cover
him
for
he
is
old
poor
beast
padron
ntoni
stretched
on
the
mattress
heard
nothing
and
they
had
put
a
covering
drawn
over
canes
on
the
cart
so
that
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
carrying
a
corpse
for
him
it
is
best
that
he
should
not
hear
continued
cousin
alfio
he
felt
for
ntoni
s
trouble
and
it
would
be
so
much
worse
if
he
ever
came
to
hear
how
lia
has
he
asked
me
about
her
often
when
we
were
alone
said
nunziata
he
wanted
to
know
where
she
she
is
worse
off
than
her
brother
is
we
poor
things
are
like
sheep
we
go
where
we
see
others
go
you
must
never
tell
any
one
especially
any
one
in
our
place
where
i
saw
lia
for
it
would
kill
sant
agata
she
recognized
me
certainly
when
i
passed
where
she
stood
at
the
door
for
she
turned
white
and
then
red
and
i
whipped
my
mule
to
get
past
as
quick
as
i
could
and
i
am
sure
that
poor
thing
would
rather
have
had
the
cart
go
over
her
or
that
i
might
have
been
driving
her
the
corpse
that
her
grandfather
seems
now
the
family
of
the
malavoglia
is
destroyed
and
you
and
alessio
must
bring
it
up
we
have
the
money
for
the
plenishing
at
saint
john
s
day
we
shall
sell
the
bravo
so
when
the
money
is
put
away
there
won
t
be
the
chance
of
losing
it
in
a
day
as
you
might
if
the
calf
happened
to
die
the
lord
forbid
here
we
are
at
the
first
houses
of
the
town
and
you
can
wait
for
me
here
if
you
don
t
want
to
come
to
the
no
i
want
to
go
too
so
at
least
i
shall
see
where
they
put
him
and
he
will
have
me
with
him
to
the
last
padron
ntoni
saw
them
even
to
the
last
moment
and
while
nunziata
went
away
with
alfio
mosca
slowly
slowly
down
the
long
long
room
that
seemed
like
a
church
he
accompanied
them
with
his
eyes
and
then
turned
on
his
side
and
moved
no
more
cousin
alfio
and
nunziata
rolled
up
the
mattress
and
the
cover
and
got
into
the
cart
and
drove
home
over
the
long
dusty
road
in
silence
alessio
beat
his
head
with
his
fists
and
tore
his
hair
when
he
found
his
grandfather
no
longer
in
his
bed
and
when
they
brought
home
his
mattress
rolled
up
and
raved
at
mena
as
if
it
had
been
she
who
had
sent
him
away
but
cousin
alfio
said
to
him
what
will
you
have
the
house
of
the
malavoglia
is
destroyed
and
you
and
nunziata
must
set
it
going
he
wanted
to
go
on
talking
about
the
money
and
about
the
calf
of
which
he
and
the
girl
had
been
talking
as
they
went
to
town
but
mena
and
alessio
would
not
listen
to
him
but
sat
with
their
heads
in
their
hands
and
eyes
full
of
tears
at
the
door
of
the
house
where
they
were
now
alone
indeed
cousin
alfio
tried
to
comfort
them
by
talking
of
the
old
days
of
the
house
by
the
when
they
used
to
talk
to
each
other
from
the
doors
in
the
moonlight
and
how
all
day
long
sant
agata
s
loom
was
beating
and
the
hens
were
clucking
and
they
heard
the
voice
of
la
longa
who
was
always
busy
now
everything
was
changed
and
when
one
left
one
s
own
place
it
was
best
he
said
never
to
come
back
for
even
the
street
was
not
the
same
now
there
was
no
one
coming
there
for
the
mangiacarubbe
and
even
don
silvestro
never
was
seen
waiting
for
the
zuppidda
to
fall
at
his
feet
and
uncle
crucifix
was
always
shut
up
in
the
house
looking
after
his
things
or
quarrelling
with
vespa
and
even
in
the
drug
shop
there
wasn
t
so
much
talking
since
don
franco
had
looked
the
law
in
the
face
and
shut
himself
in
to
read
the
paper
and
pounded
all
his
ideas
up
into
his
mortar
to
pass
away
the
time
even
padron
cipolla
no
longer
wore
out
the
steps
of
the
church
by
sitting
there
so
much
since
he
had
had
no
peace
at
home
one
fine
day
came
the
news
that
padron
was
going
to
be
married
in
order
that
the
mangiacarubbe
might
not
devour
his
substance
in
spite
of
him
for
that
he
now
no
longer
wore
out
the
but
was
going
to
marry
barbara
zuppidda
and
he
said
matrimony
was
like
a
growled
uncle
crucifix
after
that
i
ll
trust
the
curious
girls
said
that
barbara
was
going
to
marry
her
grandfather
but
sensible
people
like
peppi
naso
and
goosefoot
and
don
franco
too
murmured
now
venera
has
got
the
better
of
don
silvestro
and
it
is
a
great
blow
for
don
and
it
would
be
better
if
he
left
the
place
hang
all
foreigners
here
no
foreigners
ever
really
take
root
don
silvestro
will
never
dare
to
measure
himself
with
padron
what
did
he
think
screamed
venera
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
that
he
could
starve
me
into
giving
him
my
girl
this
time
i
will
have
my
way
and
i
have
made
my
husband
understand
as
much
the
faithful
dog
sticks
to
his
own
we
want
no
foreigners
in
our
house
once
we
were
much
better
off
in
the
place
before
the
strangers
came
to
write
down
on
paper
every
mouthful
that
one
ate
or
to
pound
in
a
mortar
and
fatten
on
other
people
s
blood
then
everybody
knew
everybody
and
what
everybody
did
and
what
their
fathers
and
grandfathers
had
done
even
to
what
they
had
to
eat
if
one
saw
a
person
pass
one
knew
where
they
were
going
and
the
fields
and
the
vineyards
belonged
to
the
people
who
were
born
among
them
and
the
fish
didn
t
let
themselves
be
caught
by
just
anybody
in
those
days
people
didn
t
go
wandering
here
and
there
and
didn
t
die
in
the
since
everybody
was
getting
married
alfio
mosca
would
have
been
glad
to
marry
cousin
mena
who
had
no
longer
any
prospect
of
marrying
since
the
malavoglia
family
was
broken
up
and
cousin
alfio
could
not
now
be
called
a
bad
match
for
her
with
the
mule
which
he
had
bought
so
he
ruminated
one
sunday
over
all
the
reasons
which
could
give
him
courage
to
speak
to
her
as
he
sat
by
her
side
in
front
of
the
door
with
his
back
against
the
wall
breaking
twigs
off
the
bushes
to
give
himself
a
countenance
and
pass
away
the
time
she
watched
the
people
passing
by
which
was
her
way
of
keeping
holiday
if
you
are
willing
to
take
me
now
cousin
mena
he
said
at
last
i
am
ready
for
my
poor
mena
did
not
even
turn
red
feeling
that
cousin
alfio
had
guessed
that
she
had
been
willing
to
have
him
at
the
time
when
they
were
going
to
give
her
to
brasi
cipolla
so
long
ago
that
time
appeared
and
she
herself
so
changed
i
am
old
now
cousin
alfio
she
said
i
shall
never
if
you
are
old
then
i
am
old
too
for
i
was
older
than
you
were
when
we
used
to
talk
to
each
other
from
the
windows
and
it
seems
as
if
it
was
but
yesterday
i
remember
it
all
so
well
but
it
must
be
eight
years
ago
and
now
when
your
brother
alessio
is
married
you
will
be
left
mena
drew
her
shoulders
together
with
cousin
anna
s
favorite
gesture
for
she
too
had
learned
to
do
god
s
will
and
not
complain
and
cousin
alfio
seeing
this
went
on
then
you
do
not
care
for
me
cousin
mena
and
i
beg
you
to
forgive
my
asking
you
to
marry
me
i
know
that
you
are
above
me
for
you
are
the
daughter
of
a
but
now
you
have
nothing
and
when
your
brother
marries
you
will
be
left
alone
i
have
my
mule
and
my
cart
and
i
would
let
you
want
for
nothing
cousin
mena
but
pardon
the
liberty
i
have
you
have
not
taken
a
liberty
cousin
alfio
nor
am
i
offended
i
would
have
said
yes
to
you
when
we
had
the
and
the
house
by
the
if
my
relations
had
been
willing
and
god
knows
what
i
had
in
my
heart
when
you
went
away
to
bicocca
with
the
and
it
seems
as
if
i
could
see
still
the
light
in
the
stable
and
you
piling
all
your
things
in
the
little
cart
in
the
court
before
your
house
do
you
remember
indeed
i
do
remember
then
why
do
you
not
take
me
now
when
i
have
the
mule
instead
of
the
donkey
and
your
family
will
not
say
no
i
am
too
old
to
marry
said
mena
with
her
head
bent
down
i
am
years
old
and
it
is
too
late
for
me
to
marry
no
that
is
not
the
reason
you
will
not
marry
me
said
alfio
with
bent
head
as
well
as
she
you
won
t
tell
me
the
real
reason
and
they
went
on
breaking
the
twigs
without
speaking
or
looking
at
each
other
when
he
got
up
to
go
away
with
drooping
shoulders
and
bent
head
mena
followed
him
with
her
eyes
as
long
as
she
could
see
him
and
then
looked
at
the
wall
opposite
and
sighed
as
alfio
mosca
said
alessio
had
taken
nunziata
to
wife
and
had
bought
back
the
house
by
the
i
am
too
old
to
marry
said
mena
get
married
you
who
are
still
young
and
so
she
went
up
into
the
upper
room
of
the
house
by
the
medlar
like
an
old
saucepan
and
had
set
her
heart
at
rest
waiting
until
nunziata
should
give
her
children
to
be
a
mother
to
they
had
the
hens
in
the
and
the
calf
in
the
stable
and
the
fodder
and
the
wood
in
the
shed
and
the
nets
and
all
sorts
of
tackle
hanging
up
just
as
padron
ntoni
had
described
them
and
nunziata
had
planted
cabbages
and
cauliflowers
in
the
garden
with
those
slender
arms
of
hers
that
no
one
would
have
dreamed
could
have
bleached
such
yards
and
yards
of
linen
or
that
such
a
slip
of
a
creature
could
have
brought
into
the
world
those
rosy
fat
babies
that
mena
was
always
carrying
about
the
place
as
if
she
had
borne
them
and
was
their
mother
in
very
truth
cousin
mosca
shook
his
head
when
he
saw
her
pass
and
turned
away
with
drooping
shoulders
you
did
not
think
me
worthy
of
the
honor
of
marrying
you
he
said
once
when
they
were
alone
and
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
no
cousin
alfio
answered
mena
with
starting
tears
i
swear
it
by
the
soul
of
this
innocent
creature
in
my
arms
that
is
not
my
motive
but
i
can
not
and
why
should
you
not
marry
cousin
mena
no
no
repeated
cousin
mena
now
outright
don
t
make
me
say
it
cousin
alfio
don
t
make
me
speak
if
i
were
to
marry
now
people
would
begin
to
talk
again
of
my
sister
lia
so
that
no
one
can
marry
a
girl
of
the
malavoglia
after
what
has
happened
you
yourself
would
be
the
first
to
repent
of
doing
it
leave
me
i
shall
never
marry
and
you
must
set
your
heart
at
so
cousin
alfio
set
his
heart
at
rest
and
mena
continued
to
carry
her
little
nephews
in
her
arms
almost
as
if
her
heart
too
were
at
rest
and
she
swept
out
the
room
to
be
ready
for
the
others
when
they
came
back
for
they
also
had
been
born
in
the
house
as
if
they
were
gone
on
journeys
from
which
any
one
ever
came
back
said
goosefoot
meanwhile
padron
ntoni
was
gone
gone
on
a
long
journey
farther
than
trieste
farther
than
alexandria
in
egypt
the
journey
whence
no
man
ever
yet
came
back
and
when
his
name
fell
into
the
talk
as
they
sat
resting
counting
up
the
expenses
of
the
week
or
making
plans
for
the
future
in
the
shade
of
the
with
the
plates
upon
their
laps
a
silence
fell
suddenly
upon
them
for
they
all
seemed
to
have
the
poor
old
man
before
their
eyes
as
they
had
seen
him
the
last
time
they
went
to
visit
him
in
that
great
wide
chamber
full
of
beds
in
long
rows
where
they
had
to
look
about
before
they
could
find
him
and
the
grandfather
waited
for
them
as
the
souls
wait
in
purgatory
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
although
he
now
could
hardly
see
and
went
on
touching
them
to
be
sure
that
they
were
really
there
and
still
said
nothing
though
they
could
see
by
his
face
that
there
was
much
he
wished
to
say
and
their
hearts
ached
to
see
the
suffering
in
his
face
which
he
could
not
tell
them
when
they
told
him
however
how
they
had
got
back
the
house
by
the
medlar
and
were
going
to
take
him
back
to
trezza
again
he
said
yes
yes
with
his
eyes
to
which
the
light
came
back
once
more
and
he
tried
to
smile
with
that
smile
of
those
who
smile
no
more
or
who
smile
for
the
last
time
which
stays
planted
in
the
heart
like
a
knife
and
so
it
was
with
the
malavoglia
when
they
went
on
monday
with
alfio
mosca
s
cart
to
bring
back
their
grandfather
and
found
that
he
was
gone
remembering
all
these
things
they
left
the
spoons
on
their
plates
and
went
on
thinking
and
thinking
of
all
that
had
happened
and
it
all
seemed
dark
as
it
was
under
the
shade
of
the
now
when
their
cousin
anna
came
to
spin
a
little
while
with
her
gossips
she
had
white
hair
and
had
lost
her
cheerful
laugh
because
she
had
no
time
to
be
gay
now
that
she
had
all
that
family
on
her
shoulders
and
rocco
too
and
every
day
she
had
to
go
hunting
him
up
about
the
streets
or
in
front
of
the
tavern
and
drive
him
home
like
a
vagabond
calf
and
the
malavoglia
had
also
two
vagabonds
and
alessio
went
on
beating
his
brains
to
think
where
they
could
be
by
what
burning
hot
roads
white
with
dust
that
they
had
never
yet
come
back
after
all
that
long
long
time
late
one
evening
the
dog
began
to
bark
behind
the
door
of
the
court
and
alessio
himself
who
went
to
open
the
door
did
not
know
ntoni
who
had
come
back
with
a
bag
under
his
arm
so
changed
was
he
covered
with
dust
and
with
a
long
beard
when
he
had
come
in
and
sat
down
in
a
corner
they
hardly
dared
to
welcome
him
he
did
not
seem
like
himself
at
all
and
looked
about
the
walls
as
if
he
saw
them
for
the
first
time
and
the
dog
who
had
never
known
him
barked
at
him
without
stopping
they
gave
him
food
and
he
bent
his
head
over
the
plate
and
ate
and
drank
as
if
he
had
not
seen
the
gifts
of
god
for
days
and
days
in
silence
but
the
others
could
not
eat
for
sadness
then
ntoni
when
he
had
eaten
and
rested
a
while
took
up
his
bag
to
go
alessio
had
hardly
dared
to
speak
his
brother
was
so
changed
but
seeing
him
take
his
bag
again
in
act
to
go
his
heart
leaped
up
into
his
breast
and
mena
said
in
a
wild
sort
of
way
you
re
going
yes
replied
ntoni
and
where
will
you
go
asked
alessio
i
don
t
know
i
came
to
see
you
all
but
since
i
have
been
here
the
food
seems
to
poison
me
besides
i
can
t
stay
here
where
everybody
knows
me
and
for
that
i
came
at
night
i
ll
go
along
way
off
where
nobody
knows
me
and
earn
my
the
others
hardly
dared
to
breathe
for
their
hearts
felt
as
if
they
were
held
in
a
vice
and
they
felt
that
he
was
right
in
speaking
as
he
did
ntoni
stood
at
the
door
looking
about
him
not
being
able
to
make
up
his
mind
to
go
i
will
let
you
know
where
i
am
he
said
at
last
and
when
he
was
in
the
court
under
the
where
it
was
dark
he
said
and
grandfather
alessio
did
not
answer
ntoni
was
silent
too
for
a
while
and
then
said
i
did
not
see
and
as
he
waited
in
vain
for
the
answer
he
added
with
a
quiver
in
his
voice
as
if
he
were
cold
is
she
dead
too
still
alessio
did
not
answer
then
ntoni
who
was
under
the
with
his
bag
in
his
hand
sat
down
for
his
legs
trembled
under
him
but
rose
up
suddenly
stammering
adieu
i
must
before
going
away
he
wanted
to
go
over
the
house
to
see
if
everything
were
in
its
old
place
but
now
he
who
had
had
the
heart
to
leave
them
all
and
to
stab
don
michele
and
to
pass
five
years
in
prison
had
not
the
heart
to
pass
from
one
room
into
another
unless
they
bade
him
do
it
alessio
who
saw
in
his
eyes
that
he
wanted
to
see
all
the
place
took
him
into
the
stable
to
show
him
the
calf
nunziata
had
bought
which
was
fat
and
sleek
and
in
a
corner
there
was
the
hen
with
her
chickens
then
he
took
him
in
the
kitchen
where
they
had
made
a
new
oven
and
into
the
room
beside
it
where
mena
slept
with
nunziata
s
children
who
seemed
to
her
like
her
own
ntoni
looked
at
everything
and
nodded
his
head
saying
there
grandfather
would
have
put
the
calf
and
here
the
hens
used
to
be
and
here
the
girls
slept
when
there
was
the
other
one
but
there
he
stopped
short
and
looked
about
him
with
tears
in
his
eyes
at
that
moment
the
mangiacarubbe
passed
by
scolding
brasi
cipolla
her
husband
at
the
top
of
her
voice
and
ntoni
said
that
one
has
found
a
husband
and
now
when
they
have
done
quarrelling
they
will
go
back
to
their
own
house
to
the
others
were
silent
and
all
the
village
was
still
only
now
and
then
was
heard
the
closing
of
some
door
and
alessio
at
last
found
courage
to
say
if
you
will
you
too
have
a
house
to
sleep
in
the
bed
is
here
kept
on
purpose
for
no
replied
ntoni
i
must
go
away
there
is
my
mother
s
bed
here
too
that
she
wetted
with
her
tears
when
i
wanted
to
go
and
leave
her
do
you
remember
the
pleasant
talks
we
used
to
have
in
the
evenings
while
we
were
salting
the
anchovies
and
nunziata
would
give
out
riddles
for
us
to
guess
and
mamma
was
there
and
lia
and
all
of
us
and
we
could
hear
the
whole
village
talking
as
if
we
had
been
all
one
family
and
i
was
ignorant
and
knew
no
better
then
than
to
want
to
get
away
but
now
i
know
how
it
all
was
and
i
must
go
i
must
he
spoke
at
that
moment
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
and
his
head
bent
down
between
his
shoulders
the
alessio
threw
his
arms
round
his
neck
adieu
repeated
ntoni
you
see
that
i
am
right
in
saying
that
i
must
go
adieu
forgive
me
all
of
and
he
went
with
his
bag
under
his
arm
then
when
he
was
in
the
middle
of
the
piazza
now
dark
and
deserted
for
all
the
doors
were
shut
he
stopped
to
hear
if
they
would
shut
the
door
of
the
house
by
the
while
the
dog
barked
behind
and
told
him
in
that
sound
that
he
was
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
place
only
the
sea
went
on
murmuring
to
him
the
usual
story
down
there
between
the
fariglione
for
the
sea
has
no
country
either
and
belongs
to
whoever
will
pause
to
listen
to
it
here
or
there
wherever
the
sun
dies
or
is
born
and
at
aci
trezza
it
has
even
a
way
of
its
own
of
murmuring
which
one
can
recognize
immediately
as
it
gurgles
in
and
out
among
the
rocks
where
it
breaks
and
seems
like
the
voice
of
a
friend
then
ntoni
stopped
in
the
road
to
look
back
at
the
dark
village
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
bear
to
leave
it
now
that
he
knew
all
and
he
sat
down
on
the
low
wall
of
master
filippo
s
vineyard
he
sat
there
for
a
long
time
thinking
of
many
things
looking
at
the
dark
village
and
listening
to
the
murmur
of
the
sea
below
he
sat
there
until
certain
sounds
that
he
knew
well
began
to
be
heard
and
voices
called
to
each
other
from
the
doors
and
shutters
banged
and
steps
sounded
in
the
dark
streets
on
the
beach
at
the
bottom
of
the
piazza
lights
began
to
twinkle
he
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
the
three
kings
which
glowed
in
the
sky
and
the
puddara
announcing
the
dawn
as
he
had
seen
it
do
so
many
times
then
he
bent
down
his
head
once
more
thinking
of
all
the
story
of
his
life
little
by
little
the
sea
grew
light
and
the
three
kings
paled
in
the
sky
and
the
houses
became
visible
one
after
another
in
the
streets
with
their
closed
doors
that
all
knew
each
other
only
before
vanni
pizzuti
s
shop
there
was
the
lamp
and
rocco
spatu
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
coughing
and
spitting
before
long
uncle
santoro
will
open
the
door
thought
ntoni
and
curl
himself
up
beside
it
and
begin
his
day
s
he
looked
at
the
sea
again
that
now
had
grown
purple
and
was
all
covered
with
boats
that
had
begun
the
day
s
work
too
then
took
his
bag
and
said
now
it
is
time
i
should
go
for
people
will
be
beginning
to
pass
by
but
the
first
man
of
them
all
to
begin
his
day
s
work
has
been
rocco
the
end
