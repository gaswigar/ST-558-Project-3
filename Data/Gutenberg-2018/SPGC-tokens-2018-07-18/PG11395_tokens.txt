the
editor
paid
for
the
lunch
as
editors
do
he
lighted
his
seventh
cigarette
and
leaned
back
the
conversation
which
had
zigzagged
from
the
war
to
zuloaga
and
from
rasputin
the
monk
to
the
number
of

a

narrowed
down
to
the
thin
straight
line
of
business
now
do
misunderstand
please
we
not
presuming
to
dictate
dear
me
no
we
have
always
felt
that
the
writer
should
be
free
to
express
that
which
is
in
his
ah
heart
but
in
the
last
year
we
been
swamped
with
these
drab
realistic
stories
strong
relentless
things
you
know
about
dishwashers
with
a
lot
of
fine
detail
about
the
fuzz
of
grease
on
the
rim
of
the
pan
and
then
those
drear
and
hopeless
ones
about
fallen
sisters
who
end
it
all
in
the
east
river
the
east
river
must
be
choked
up
with
now
i
know
that
life
is
real
life
is
earnest
and
i
not
demanding
a
happy
ending
exactly
but
if
you
could
that
is
would
you
do
you
see
your
way
at
all
clear
to
giving
us
a
fairly
cheerful
story
not
necessarily
glad
but
not
so
darned
russian
if
you
get
me
not
pink
but
not
all
grey
either
say
mauve
that
was
josie
fifer
existence
mostly
grey
with
a
dash
of
pink
which
makes
mauve
unless
you
are
connected
which
you
probably
are
not
with
the
great
firm
of
hahn
lohman
theatrical
producers
you
never
will
have
heard
of
josie
fifer
there
are
things
about
the
theatre
that
the
public
does
not
know
a
statement
at
first
blush
to
be
disputed
the
press
agent
the
special
writer
the
critic
the
magazines
the
sunday
supplement
the
divorce
courts
what
have
they
left
untold
we
know
the

miss

who
her

are

how
much
the

have
offered

of

hands
rewriting
it
long
before
the
opening
night
we
know
more
about
the
piece
than
does
the
playwright
himself
and
are
ten
times
less
eager
to
see
it
josie
fifer
knowledge
surpassed
even
this
for
she
was
keeper
of
the
ghosts
of
the
firm
of
hahn
lohman
not
only
was
she
present
at
the
birth
of
a
play
she
officiated
at
its
funeral
she
carried
the
keys
to
the
closets
that
housed
the
skeletons
of
the
firm
when
a
play
died
of
inanition
old
age
or
as
was
sometimes
the
case
before
it
was
born
it
was
josie
fifer
who
laid
out
its
remains
and
followed
it
to
the
grave
her
notification
of
its
demise
would
come
thus
hello
fifer
this
is
mccabe
the
property
man
of
at
the
phone
well
a
little
waspish
this
morning
are
you
josephine
i
got
bathing
suits
for
the
no
company
to
mend
and
clean
and
press
before
five
this
afternoon
if
you
think
going
to
stand
here
wasting
my
all
right
all
right
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
that
closes
saturday
the
stuff
be
up
monday
morning
early
a
sardonic
laugh
from
josie
and
yet
they
say
in
a
name
the
unfortunate
play
had
been
all
that
its
title
implies
its
purpose
was
to
star
an
actress
who
had
a
glint
her
costume
alone
had
cost
but
even
russian
sable
bands
ca
carry
a
bad
play
the
critics
had
pounced
on
it
with
the
savagery
of
their
kind
and
hacked
it
limb
from
limb
leaving
its
carcass
to
rot
under
the
pitiless
white
glare
of
broadway
the
dress
with
the
russian
sable
bands
went
the
way
of
all
hahn
lohman
tragedies
josie
fifer
received
it
if
not
reverently
still
appreciatively
i
should
think
sid
hahn
would
know
by
this
time
she
observed
sniffily
as
her
expert
fingers
shook
out
the
silken
folds
and
smoothed
the
fabulous
fur
that
auburn
hair
and
a
gurgle
and
a
lucille
dress
do
make
a
play
besides
fritzi
kirke
wears
the
biggest
shoe
of
any
actress
i
ever
saw
a
woman
with
feet
like
that
she
picked
up
a
satin
slipper
size
c
has
any
business
on
the
stage
she
ought
to
travel
with
a
circus
here
etta
hang
this
away
in
d
next
to
the
amethyst
blue
velvet
and
be
sure
and
lock
the
door
mccabe
had
been
right
a
waspish
wit
was
josie
the
question
is
whether
to
reveal
to
you
now
where
it
was
that
josie
fifer
reigned
thus
queen
of
the
or
to
take
you
back
to
the
days
that
led
up
to
her
being
there
the
days
when
she
was
jos√©
fyfer
on
the
programme
her
domain
was
the
storage
warehouse
of
hahn
lohman
as
you
may
have
guessed
if
your
business
lay
street
way
you
might
have
passed
the
building
a
hundred
times
without
once
giving
it
a
seeing
glance
it
was
not
street
of
the
small
shops
the
smart
crowds
and
the
glittering
motors
it
was
the
lying
east
of
the
grand
central
sluice
gates
east
of
fashion
east
in
a
word
of
fifth
avenue
a
great
square
brick
building
cobwebbed
and
having
the
look
of
a
plant
or
a
car
barn
fallen
into
disuse
dusty
neglected
almost
eerie
yet
within
it
lurks
romance
and
her
sombre
sister
tragedy
and
their
antic
brother
comedy
the
a
worn
flight
of
wooden
steps
leads
up
from
the
sidewalk
to
the
dim
hallway
a
passage
wherein
you
are
met
by
a
genial
sign
which
reads
no
admittance
keep
out
this
means
you
to
confirm
this
the
eye
penetrating
the
gloom
is
confronted
by
a
great
blank
metal
door
that
sheathes
the
elevator
to
ride
in
that
elevator
is
to
know
adventure
so
painfully
so
protestingly
with
such
creaks
and
jerks
and
lurchings
does
it
pull
itself
from
floor
to
floor
like
an
octogenarian
who
grunting
and
groaning
hoists
himself
from
his
by
slow
stages
that
wring
a
protest
from
ankle
knee
hip
back
and
shoulder
the
corkscrew
stairway
broken
and
footworn
though
it
is
seems
infinitely
less
perilous
first
floor
second
third
fourth
whew
and
there
you
are
in
josie
fifer
kingdom
a
great
front
room
unexpectedly
bright
and
even
cosy
with
its
whir
of
sewing
machines
tables
and
tables
and
tables
piled
with
orderly
stacks
of
every
sort
of
clothing
from
shoes
to
hats
from
gloves
to
parasols
and
in
the
room
beyond
this
and
beyond
that
and
again
beyond
that
row
after
row
of
high
wooden
cabinets
stretching
the
width
of
the
room
and
forming
innumerable
aisles
all
of
wives
could
have
been
tucked
away
in
one
corner
of
the
remotest
and
least
of
these
and
no
one
the
wiser
all
grimly
shut
and
locked
they
are
with
the
key
in
josie
pocket
but
when
at
the
behest
of
mccabe
or
sometimes
even
sid
hahn
himself
she
unlocked
and
opened
one
of
these
doors
what
treasures
hung
revealed
what
shimmer
and
sparkle
and
perfume
and
moth
balls
the
electric
light
bulb
held
high
in
one
hand
josie
would
stand
at
the
door
like
a
priestess
before
her
altar
there
they
swung
the
ghosts
and
the
skeletons
side
by
side
you
remember
that
slinking
black
satin
snakelike
sheath
that
gita
morini
wore
in
little
eyolf
there
it
dangles
limp
invertebrate
yet
how
eloquent
no
other
woman
in
the
world
could
have
worn
that
gown
with
its
unbroken
line
from
throat
to
hem
its
smooth
high
black
satin
collar
its
writhing
tail
that
went
after
her
in
it
she
had
looked
like
a
sleek
and
wicked
python
that
had
fasted
for
a
long
long
time
dresses
there
are
that
have
made
stage
history
surely
you
remember
the
beruffled
confection
in
which
the
beautiful
elsa
marriott
swam
into
our
ken
in
mississipp
she
used
to
say
wistfully
that
she
always
got
a
hand
on
her
entrance
in
that
dress
it
was
due
to
the
sheer
shock
of
delight
that
thrilled
audience
after
audience
as
it
beheld
her
loveliness
enhanced
by
this
floating
diaphanous
tulle
cloud
there
it
hangs
its
pristine
freshness
vanished
quite
yet
as
fragrant
with
romance
as
is
the
sere
and
withered
blossom
of
a
dead
white
rose
pressed
within
the
leaves
of
a
book
of
love
poems
just
next
it
incongruously
enough
flaunt
the
wicked
froufrou
skirts
and
the
bodice
and
the
wasp
waist
of
the
abbreviated
costume
in
which
cora
kassell
used
so
generously
to
display
her
charms
a
rich
and
portly
society
matron
of
pittsburgh
now
she
whose
name
had
been
a
synonym
for
pulchritude
these
thirty
years
she
who
had
had
more
cold
creams
hats
cigars
corsets
horses
and
lotions
named
for
her
than
any
woman
in
history
her
ample
girth
would
have
wrought
sad
havoc
with
that
waist
now
gone
are
the
chaste
curves
of
the
slim
white
silk
legs
that
used
to
kick
so
lithely
from
the
swirl
of
lace
and
chiffon
yet
there
it
hangs
pertly
pathetic
mute
evidence
of
her
vanished
youth
her
delectable
beauty
and
her
unblushing
confidence
in
those
same
up
one
aisle
and
down
the
next
velvet
satin
lace
and
broadcloth
here
the
costume
the
great
canfield
had
worn
in
richard
iii
there
the
little
cocked
hat
and
the
slashed
jerkin
in
which
maude
hammond
as
peterkins
winged
her
way
to
fame
up
through
the
hearts
of
a
million
children
whose
ages
ranged
from
seven
to
seventy
brocades
and
ginghams
tailor
suits
and
peignoirs
puffed
sleeves
and
tight
dramatic
history
all
they
spelled
failure
success
hope
despair
vanity
pride
triumph
decay
tragic
ghosts
over
which
josie
fifer
held
grim
sway
have
i
told
you
that
josie
fifer
moving
nimbly
about
the
great
storehouse
limped
as
she
went
the
left
leg
swung
as
a
normal
leg
should
the
right
followed
haltingly
sagging
at
hip
and
knee
and
that
brings
us
back
to
the
reason
for
her
being
where
she
was
and
what
the
story
of
how
josie
fifer
came
to
be
mistress
of
the
robes
of
the
firm
of
hahn
lohman
is
one
of
those
stage
tragedies
that
never
have
a
public
performance
josie
had
been
one
of
those
little
girls
who
speak
pieces
at
suppers
held
in
the
basement
of
the
presbyterian
church
her
mother
had
been
a
silly
idle
woman
addicted
to
mother
hubbards
and
novels
about
the
house
her
one
passion
was
the
theatre
a
passion
that
had
very
scant
opportunity
for
feeding
in
wapello
iowa
josie
talent
was
evidently
a
direct
inheritance
some
might
call
it
a
taint
two
days
before
one
of
josie
public
appearances
her
mother
would
twist
the
child
hair
into
innumerable
rag
curlers
that
stood
out
in
grotesque
bumps
all
over
her
fair
head
on
the
eventful
evening
each
rag
chrysalis
would
burst
into
a
butterfly
curl
in
a
dress
over
a
slip
made
in
what
her
mother
called
empire
style
josie
would
deliver
herself
of
entertaining
big
sister
beau
and
other
sophisticated
classics
with
an
incredible
ease
and
absence
of
embarrassment
it
was
a
definite
boldness
in
her
she
merely
liked
standing
there
before
all
those
people
in
her
blue
dress
and
her
toe
slippers
speaking
her
pieces
with
enhancing
gestures
taught
her
by
her
mother
in
innumerable
rehearsals
any
one
who
has
ever
lived
in
wapello
iowa
or
its
equivalent
remembers
the
old
opera
house
on
the
corner
of
main
and
elm
with
schroeder
drug
store
occupying
the
first
floor
opera
never
came
within
three
hundred
miles
of
wapello
unless
it
was
the
comic
kind
it
was
before
the
day
of
the
ubiquitous
theatre
that
has
since
been
the
undoing
of
the
stand
and
the
stock
company
the
old
opera
house
furnished
unlimited
thrills
for
josie
and
her
mother
from
the
time
josie
was
seven
she
was
taken
to
see
whatever
wapello
was
offered
in
the
way
of
the
drama
that
consisted
mostly
of
plays
of
the
type
by
the
time
she
was
ten
she
knew
the
whole
repertoire
of
the
maude
la
vergne
stock
company
by
heart
she
was
with
east
lynne
and
the
two
orphans
and
even
camille
left
her
cold
she
was
as
wise
to
the
trade
tricks
as
is
a
new
york
first
nighter
she
would
sit
there
in
the
darkened
auditorium
of
a
saturday
afternoon
surveying
the
stage
with
a
judicious
and
undeceived
eye
as
she
sucked
indefatigably
at
a
lollipop
extracted
from
the
sticky
bag
clutched
in
one
moist
palm
a
bag
of
candy
to
each
and
every
girl
a
ball
or
a
top
to
each
and
every
boy
josie
knew
that
the
who
came
out
between
the
first
and
second
acts
to
sing
a
song
would
whisk
off
to
reappear
immediately
in
pink
satin
and
curls
when
the
heroine
left
home
in
a
shawl
and
a
sudden
snowstorm
that
followed
her
upstage
and
stopped
when
she
went
off
josie
was
interested
but
undeceived
she
knew
that
the
white
horse
used
in
the
civil
war
entitled
his
southern
sweetheart
came
from
joe
brink
livery
stable
in
exchange
for
four
passes
and
that
the
faithful
old
negro
servitor
in
the
white
cotton
wig
would
save
somebody
from
something
before
the
afternoon
was
over
in
was
inevitable
that
as
josie
grew
older
she
should
take
part
in
plays
it
was
one
of
these
tinsel
affairs
that
had
made
clear
to
her
just
where
her
future
lay
the
wapello
helped
her
in
her
decision
she
had
taken
the
part
of
a
gipsy
queen
appropriately
costumed
in
slightly
soiled
white
satin
slippers
with
heels
and
a
white
satin
dress
enhanced
by
a
red
sash
a
black
velvet
bolero
and
large
hoop
earrings
she
had
danced
and
sung
with
a
pert
confidence
and
the
had
pronounced
her
talents
not
amateur
but
professional
and
had
advised
the
managers
who
no
doubt
read
the
wapello
daily
along
with
their
to
seek
her
out
and
speedily
josie
did
wait
for
them
to
take
the
hint
she
sought
them
out
instead
there
followed
seven
tawdry
heartbreaking
years
supe
stock
musical
comedy
josie
went
through
them
all
if
any
illusions
about
the
stage
had
survived
her
wapello
days
they
would
have
vanished
in
the
first
six
months
of
her
dramatic
career
by
the
time
she
was
she
had
acquired
the
wisdom
of
fifty
a
coat
a
turquoise
ring
with
a
number
of
crushed
diamonds
surrounding
it
and
a
reputation
for
wit
and
for
decency
the
last
had
cost
the
most
during
all
these
years
of
cheap
theatrical
boarding
houses
the
most
cheapness
in
the
world
of
stands
of
insult
disappointment
rebuff
and
something
that
often
came
perilously
near
to
want
josie
fifer
managed
to
retain
a
certain
humorous
outlook
on
life
there
was
something
whimsical
about
it
she
could
even
see
a
joke
on
herself
when
she
first
signed
her
name
jos√©
fyfer
for
example
she
did
it
with
an
appreciative
giggle
and
a
glint
in
her
eye
as
she
formed
the
accent
mark
over
the
they
never
stop
me
now
she
said
i
made
but
i
wish
i
knew
if
that
j
was
pronounced
like
h
in
humbug
are
there
any
spanish
blondes
it
used
to
be
the
habit
of
the
other
women
in
the
company
to
say
to
her
jo
i
blue
as
the
devil
come
on
give
us
a
laugh
she
always
obliged
and
then
came
a
sunday
afternoon
in
late
august
when
her
laugh
broke
off
short
in
the
middle
and
was
forever
after
a
stunted
thing
she
was
playing
atlantic
city
in
a
musical
show
she
had
never
seen
the
ocean
before
and
she
viewed
it
now
with
an
appreciation
that
still
had
in
it
something
of
a
wapello
freshness
they
all
planned
to
go
in
bathing
that
hot
august
afternoon
after
rehearsal
josie
had
seen
pictures
of
the
beauteous
bathing
girl
dashing
into
the
foaming
breakers
she
ran
across
the
stretch
of
glistening
beach
paused
and
struck
a
pose
one
toe
pointed
waterward
her
arms
extended
affectedly
so
she
said
mincingly
so
this
is
paris
it
was
a
new
line
in
those
days
and
they
all
laughed
as
she
had
meant
they
should
so
she
leaped
into
the
water
with
bounds
and
shouts
and
much
waving
of
white
arms
a
great
floating
derelict
of
a
log
struck
her
leg
with
its
full
weight
and
with
all
the
tremendous
force
of
the
breaker
behind
it
she
doubled
up
ridiculously
and
went
down
like
a
shot
those
on
the
beach
laughed
again
when
she
came
up
and
they
saw
her
distorted
face
they
stopped
laughing
and
fished
her
out
her
leg
was
broken
in
two
places
and
mashed
in
a
dozen
jos√©
fyfer
dramatic
career
was
over
this
is
not
the
cheery
portion
of
the
story
when
she
came
out
of
the
hospital
three
months
later
she
did
very
well
indeed
with
her
crutches
but
the
woman
had
vanished
she
of
the
wapello
colouring
that
had
persisted
during
all
these
years
in
her
place
limped
a
wan
shrunken
tragic
little
figure
whose
humour
had
soured
to
a
caustic
wit
the
coat
and
the
ring
had
vanished
too
during
those
agonized
months
she
had
received
from
the
others
in
the
company
such
kindness
and
generosity
as
only
stage
folk
can
show
flowers
candy
dainties
magazines
sent
by
every
one
from
the
prima
donna
to
the
call
boy
then
the
show
left
town
there
came
a
few
letters
of
kind
inquiry
then
an
occasional
post
card
signed
by
half
a
dozen
members
of
the
company
then
these
ceased
josie
fifer
in
her
cast
and
splints
and
bandages
and
pain
dragged
out
long
hospital
days
and
interminable
hospital
nights
she
took
a
dreary
pleasure
in
following
the
tour
of
her
erstwhile
company
via
the
pages
of
the
theatrical
magazines
they
playing
detroit
this
week
she
would
announce
to
the
aloof
and
spectacled
nurse
or
stands
and
they
due
in
muncie
i
do
know
which
is
worse
playing
muncie
for
one
night
or
this
moan
factory
for
a
three
month
run
when
she
was
able
to
crawl
out
as
far
as
the
long
corridor
she
spoke
to
every
one
she
met
as
she
grew
stronger
she
visited
here
and
there
and
on
the
slightest
provocation
she
would
give
a
scene
ranging
all
the
way
from
romeo
and
juliet
to
the
black
crook
it
was
thus
she
first
met
sid
hahn
and
felt
the
warming
healing
glow
of
his
friendship
some
said
that
sid
hahn
brilliant
success
as
a
manager
at
was
due
to
his
ability
to
pick
winners
others
thought
it
was
his
refusal
to
be
discouraged
when
he
found
he
had
picked
a
failure
still
others
who
knew
him
better
were
likely
to
say
why
i
do
know
it
a
sort
of
well
you
might
call
it
charm
and
yet
did
you
ever
see
him
smile
he
got
a
grin
you
ca
resist
it
none
of
them
was
right
or
all
of
them
sid
hahn
erstwhile
usher
call
boy
press
agent
advance
man
had
a
genius
for
things
theatrical
it
was
inborn
dramatic
sensitive
artistic
intuitive
he
was
often
rendered
inarticulate
by
the
very
force
and
variety
of
his
feelings
a
little
rotund
ugly
man
sid
hahn
with
the
eyes
of
a
dreamer
the
wide
mobile
mouth
of
a
humourist
the
ears
of
a
comic
man
his
generosity
was
proverbial
and
it
amounted
to
a
vice
in
september
he
had
come
to
atlantic
city
to
try
out
splendour
it
was
a
doubtful
play
by
a
new
author
starring
sarah
haddon
for
the
first
time
no
one
dreamed
the
play
would
run
for
years
make
a
fortune
for
hahn
lift
haddon
from
obscurity
to
the
dizziest
heights
of
stardom
and
become
a
classic
of
the
stage
ten
minutes
before
the
curtain
went
up
on
the
opening
performance
hahn
was
stricken
with
appendicitis
there
was
not
even
time
to
rush
him
to
new
york
he
was
on
the
operating
table
before
the
second
act
was
begun
when
he
came
out
of
the
ether
he
said
how
did
it
go
fine
beamed
the
nurse
you
be
out
in
two
weeks
oh
hell
i
do
mean
the
operation
i
mean
the
play
he
learned
soon
enough
from
the
glowing
sarah
haddon
and
from
every
one
connected
with
the
play
he
insisted
on
seeing
them
all
daily
against
his
doctor
orders
and
succeeded
in
working
up
a
temperature
that
made
his
hospital
stay
a
four
weeks
affair
he
refused
to
take
the
tryout
results
as
final
do
be
too
bubbly
about
this
thing
he
cautioned
sarah
haddon
seen
too
many
plays
that
were
skyrockets
on
the
road
come
down
like
sticks
when
they
struck
new
york
the
company
stayed
over
in
atlantic
city
for
a
week
and
hahn
held
scraps
of
rehearsals
in
his
room
when
he
had
a
temperature
of
sarah
haddon
worked
like
a
slave
she
seemed
to
realise
that
her
great
opportunity
had
come
the
opportunity
for
which
hundreds
of
gifted
actresses
wait
a
lifetime
haddon
was
just
then
a
year
younger
than
josie
fifer
she
had
not
yet
blossomed
into
the
full
radiance
of
her
beauty
she
was
too
slender
and
inclined
to
stoop
a
bit
but
her
eyes
were
glorious
her
skin
her
whole
face
reminding
one
somehow
of
an
intelligent
flower
her
voice
was
a
golden
liquid
delight
josie
fifer
dragging
herself
from
bed
to
chair
and
from
chair
to
bed
used
to
watch
for
her
hahn
room
was
on
her
floor
sarah
haddon
in
her
youth
and
beauty
and
triumph
represented
to
josie
all
that
she
had
dreamed
of
and
never
realised
all
that
she
had
hoped
for
and
never
could
know
she
used
to
insist
on
having
her
door
open
and
she
would
lie
there
for
hours
her
eyes
fixed
on
that
spot
in
the
hall
across
which
haddon
would
flash
for
one
brief
instant
on
her
way
to
the
room
down
the
corridor
there
is
about
a
successful
actress
a
certain
radiant
something
a
glamour
a
luxuriousness
an
atmosphere
that
suggest
a
mysterious
mixture
of
silken
things
of
perfume
of
adulation
of
all
that
is
rare
and
costly
and
perishable
and
desirable
josie
fifer
stage
experience
had
included
none
of
this
but
she
knew
they
were
there
she
sensed
that
to
this
glorious
artist
would
come
all
those
fairy
gifts
that
josie
fifer
would
never
possess
all
things
about
her
her
furs
her
gloves
her
walk
her
hats
her
voice
her
very
shoe
ties
were
just
what
josie
would
have
wished
for
as
she
lay
there
she
developed
a
certain
grim
philosophy
she
got
everything
a
woman
could
wish
for
me
i
have
got
a
thing
not
a
blamed
thing
and
yet
they
say
everything
works
out
in
the
end
according
to
some
scheme
or
other
well
what
the
answer
to
this
i
wonder
i
ca
make
it
come
out
right
i
guess
one
of
the
figures
must
have
got
away
from
me
in
the
second
week
of
sid
hahn
convalescence
he
heard
somehow
of
josie
fifer
it
was
characteristic
of
him
that
he
sent
for
her
she
put
a
chiffon
scarf
about
the
neck
of
her
skimpy
little
kimono
spent
an
hour
and
ten
minutes
on
her
hair
made
up
outrageously
with
that
sublime
unconsciousness
that
comes
from
too
close
familiarity
with
rouge
pad
and
grease
jar
and
went
she
was
trembling
as
though
facing
a
audience
in
a
part
she
was
up
on
between
the
crutches
the
lameness
and
the
trembling
she
presented
to
sid
hahn
as
she
stood
in
the
doorway
a
picture
that
stabbed
his
kindly
sensitive
heart
with
a
quick
pang
of
sympathy
he
held
out
his
hand
josie
crept
into
it
at
the
feel
of
that
generous
friendly
clasp
she
stopped
trembling
said
hahn
my
nurse
tells
me
that
you
can
do
a
bedside
burlesque
of
that
made
even
that
interne
with
the
thick
glasses
laugh
go
on
and
do
it
for
me
there
a
good
girl
i
could
use
a
laugh
myself
just
now
and
josie
fifer
caught
up
a
couch
cover
for
a
cloak
with
the
scarf
that
was
about
her
neck
for
a
veil
and
using
hahn
himself
as
the
ailing
gave
a
biting
burlesque
of
the
famous
bedside
visit
that
brought
the
tears
of
laughter
to
his
eyes
and
the
nurse
flying
from
down
the
hall
this
wo
do
said
that
austere
person
wo
eh
go
on
and
stick
your
old
thermometer
in
my
mouth
what
do
i
care
a
laugh
like
that
is
worth
five
degrees
of
temperature
when
josie
rose
to
leave
he
eyed
her
keenly
and
pointed
to
the
dragging
leg
how
about
that
temporary
or
permanent
permanent
oh
fudge
who
telling
you
that
these
days
they
can
do
not
with
this
though
that
one
bone
was
mashed
into
about
splinters
and
when
it
came
to
putting
together
again
a
couple
of
pieces
were
missing
i
must
mislaid
somewhere
anyway
i
make
a
limping
exit
for
life
then
no
more
stage
for
you
eh
my
girl
no
more
stage
hahn
reached
for
a
pad
of
paper
on
the
table
at
his
bedside
scrawled
a
few
words
on
it
signed
it
in
the
fashion
which
became
famous
and
held
the
paper
out
to
her
when
you
get
out
of
here
he
said
you
come
to
new
york
and
up
to
my
office
see
give
this
at
the
door
i
got
a
job
for
you
if
you
want
it
and
that
was
how
josie
fifer
came
to
take
charge
of
the
great
hahn
lohman
storehouse
it
was
more
than
a
storehouse
it
was
a
museum
it
housed
the
archives
of
the
american
stage
if
hahn
lohman
prided
themselves
on
one
thing
more
than
on
another
it
was
the
lavish
generosity
with
which
they
invested
a
play
from
costumes
to
carpets
a
period
play
was
a
period
play
when
they
presented
it
you
never
saw
a
french
clock
on
a
dutch
mantel
in
a
hahn
lohman
production
no
hybrid
hangings
marred
their
back
drop
no
matter
what
the
play
the
firm
provided
its
furnishings
from
the
star
slippers
to
the
chandeliers
did
a
play
last
a
year
or
a
week
at
the
end
of
its
run
furniture
hangings
scenery
rugs
gowns
everything
went
off
in
wagonloads
to
the
already
crowded
storehouse
on
east
street
sometimes
a
play
proved
so
popular
that
its
original
costumes
outworn
had
to
be
renewed
sometimes
the
public
cried
thumbs
down
at
the
opening
performance
and
would
have
none
of
it
thereafter
that
meant
that
costumes
sometimes
reached
josie
fifer
while
the
wounds
of
the
dressmaker
needle
still
bled
in
them
and
whether
for
a
week
or
a
year
fur
on
a
hahn
lohman
costume
was
real
fur
its
satin
was
its
lace
real
lace
no
paste
or
tinsel
or
cardboard
about
josie
fifer
could
recall
the
scenes
in
a
play
step
by
step
from
noting
with
her
keen
eye
the
marks
left
on
costume
after
costume
by
the
ravages
of
emotion
at
the
end
of
a
play
run
she
would
hold
up
a
dress
for
critical
inspection
turning
it
this
way
and
that
this
is
the
dress
she
wore
in
her
big
scene
at
the
end
of
the
second
act
where
she
crawls
on
her
knees
to
her
wronged
husband
and
pounds
on
the
door
and
weeps
she
certainly
did
give
it
some
hard
wear
when
marriott
crawls
she
crawls
and
when
she
bawls
she
bawls
i
say
that
for
her
from
the
looks
of
this
front
breadth
she
must
have
worn
a
groove
in
the
stage
at
the
york
no
gently
sentimental
reason
caused
hahn
lohman
to
house
these
hundreds
of
costumes
these
tons
of
scenery
these
forests
of
furniture
neither
had
josie
fifer
been
hired
to
walk
wistfully
among
them
like
a
spinster
wandering
in
a
dead
rose
garden
no
they
were
stored
for
a
much
thriftier
reason
they
were
stored
if
you
must
know
for
possible
future
use
were
too
clever
not
to
use
a
last
year
costume
for
a
this
year
road
show
they
knew
what
a
coat
of
enamel
would
do
for
a
bedroom
set
it
was
josie
fifer
duty
not
only
to
tabulate
and
care
for
these
relics
but
to
refurbish
them
when
necessary
the
sewing
was
done
by
a
little
corps
of
assistants
under
josie
direction
but
all
this
came
with
the
years
when
josie
fifer
white
and
weak
first
took
charge
of
the
et
she
told
herself
it
was
only
for
a
few
months
a
year
or
two
at
most
the
end
of
sixteen
years
found
her
still
there
when
she
came
to
new
york
splendour
was
just
beginning
its
phenomenal
three
years
run
the
city
was
mad
about
the
play
people
came
to
see
it
again
and
again
a
sure
sign
of
a
long
run
the
sarah
haddon
costume
was
photographed
copied
unsuccessfully
talked
about
until
it
became
as
familiar
as
a
uniform
that
costume
had
much
to
do
with
the
play
success
though
sarah
haddon
would
never
admit
it
splendour
was
what
is
known
as
a
period
play
the
famous
dress
was
of
black
velvet
made
with
a
quaint
skirt
that
made
slim
waist
seem
fairylike
and
exquisitely
supple
the
black
velvet
bodice
outlined
the
delicate
swell
of
the
bust
a
rope
of
pearls
enhanced
the
whiteness
of
her
throat
her
hair
done
in
scallops
about
her
forehead
was
a
gleaming
marvel
of
simplicity
and
the
despair
of
every
woman
who
tried
to
copy
it
the
part
was
that
of
an
italian
opera
singer
the
play
pulsated
with
romance
and
love
glamour
and
tragedy
sarah
haddon
in
her
flowing
black
velvet
robe
and
her
pearls
and
her
pallor
was
an
exotic
throbbing
exquisite
realisation
of
what
every
woman
in
the
audience
dreamed
of
being
and
every
man
dreamed
of
loving
josie
fifer
saw
the
play
for
the
first
time
from
a
balcony
seat
given
her
by
sid
hahn
it
left
her
trembling
shaken
after
that
she
used
to
see
it
by
hook
or
crook
whenever
possible
she
used
to
come
in
at
the
stage
door
and
lurk
back
of
the
scenes
and
in
the
wings
when
she
had
no
business
there
she
invented
absurd
errands
to
take
her
to
the
theatre
where
splendour
was
playing
sid
hahn
always
said
that
after
the
big
scene
he
liked
to
watch
the
audience
swim
up
the
aisle
josie
hidden
in
the
shadows
used
to
watch
fascinated
breathless
then
one
night
she
indiscreetly
was
led
by
her
absorbed
interest
to
venture
too
far
into
the
wings
it
was
during
the
scene
where
haddon
hearing
a
street
singer
cracking
the
golden
notes
of
a√Øda
into
a
thousand
mutilated
fragments
throws
open
her
window
and
leaning
far
out
pours
a
shower
of
italian
and
broken
english
and
laughter
and
silver
coin
upon
her
amazed
compatriot
below
when
the
curtain
went
down
she
came
off
raging
what
was
that
who
was
that
standing
in
the
wings
how
dare
any
one
stand
there
everybody
knows
i
ca
have
any
one
in
the
wings
staring
it
ruined
my
scene
where
mccabe
tell
hahn
i
want
to
see
him
who
was
it
staring
at
me
like
a
ghost
josie
had
crept
away
terrified
contrite
and
yet
resentful
but
the
next
week
saw
her
back
at
the
theatre
though
she
took
care
to
stay
in
the
shadows
she
was
waiting
for
the
black
velvet
dress
it
was
more
than
a
dress
to
her
it
was
infinitely
more
than
a
stage
costume
it
was
the
habit
of
glory
it
epitomised
all
that
josie
fifer
had
missed
of
beauty
and
homage
and
success
the
play
ran
on
and
on
and
on
sarah
haddon
was
superstitious
about
the
black
gown
she
refused
to
give
it
up
for
a
new
one
she
insisted
that
if
ever
she
discarded
the
old
black
velvet
for
a
new
the
run
of
the
play
would
stop
she
assured
hahn
that
its
shabbiness
did
not
show
from
the
front
she
clung
to
it
with
that
childish
unreasonableness
that
is
so
often
found
in
people
of
the
stage
but
josie
waited
patiently
dozens
of
costumes
passed
through
her
hands
she
saw
plays
come
and
go
dresses
came
to
her
whose
lining
bore
the
mark
of
modistes
she
hung
them
away
or
refurbished
them
if
necessary
with
disinterested
conscientiousness
sometimes
her
caustic
comment
as
she
did
so
would
have
startled
the
complacency
of
the
erstwhile
wearers
of
the
garments
her
knowledge
of
the
stage
its
artifices
its
pretence
its
narrowness
its
shams
was
widening
and
deepening
no
critic
in
glasses
and
evening
clothes
was
more
scathingly
severe
than
she
she
sewed
on
satin
she
mended
fine
lace
she
polished
stage
jewels
and
waited
she
knew
that
one
day
her
patience
would
be
rewarded
and
then
at
last
came
the
familiar
voice
over
the
phone
hello
fifer
mccabe
talking
well
closes
saturday
haddon
says
she
wo
play
in
this
heat

london

the
autumn

monday
early
josie
fifer
turned
away
from
the
telephone
with
a
face
so
radiant
that
one
of
her
sewing
women
looking
up
was
moved
to
comment
got
some
good
news
miss
fifer
closes
this
week
well
my
land
to
look
at
you
a
person
would
think
you
been
losing
money
at
the
box
office
every
night
it
ran
the
look
was
still
on
her
face
when
monday
morning
came
she
was
sewing
on
a
dress
just
discarded
by
adelaide
french
the
trag√©dienne
adelaide
maid
was
said
to
be
the
woman
in
the
profession
when
french
finished
with
a
costume
it
was
useless
as
a
dress
but
it
was
something
historic
like
a
torn
and
tattered
battle
flag
an
emblem
mccabe
box
under
his
arm
stood
in
the
doorway
josie
fifer
stood
up
so
suddenly
that
the
dress
on
her
lap
fell
to
the
floor
she
stepped
over
it
heedlessly
and
went
toward
mccabe
her
eyes
on
the
pasteboard
box
behind
mccabe
stood
two
more
men
likewise
put
them
down
here
said
josie
the
men
thumped
the
boxes
down
on
the
long
table
josie
fingers
were
already
at
the
strings
she
opened
the
first
box
emptied
its
contents
tossed
them
aside
passed
on
to
the
second
her
hands
busied
themselves
among
the
silks
and
broadcloth
of
this
then
on
to
the
third
and
last
box
mccabe
and
his
men
with
scenery
and
furniture
still
to
unload
and
store
turned
to
go
their
footsteps
echoed
hollowly
as
they
clattered
down
the
worn
old
stairway
josie
snapped
the
cord
that
bound
the
third
box
her
cheeks
were
flushed
her
eyes
bright
she
turned
it
upside
down
then
she
pawed
it
over
then
she
went
back
to
the
contents
of
the
first
two
boxes
clawing
about
among
the
limp
garments
with
which
the
table
was
strewn
she
was
breathing
quickly
suddenly
it
is
here
she
cried
it
here
she
turned
and
flew
to
the
stairway
the
voices
of
the
men
came
up
to
her
she
leaned
far
over
the
railing
mccabe
mccabe
yeh
what
do
you
want
the
black
velvet
dress
the
black
velvet
dress
it
is
there
oh
yeh
that
all
right
haddon
she
got
a
bug
about
that
dress
and
she
says
she
wants
to
take
it
to
london
with
her
to
use
on
the
opening
night
she
says
if
she
wears
a
new
one
that
first
night
the
play
be
a
failure
some
temperament
that
girl
since
she
got
to
be
a
star
josie
stood
clutching
the
railing
of
the
stairway
her
disappointment
was
so
bitter
that
she
could
not
weep
she
felt
cheated
outraged
she
was
frightened
at
the
intensity
of
her
own
sensations
she
might
have
let
me
have
it
she
said
aloud
in
the
dim
half
light
of
the
hallway
she
got
everything
else
in
the
world
she
might
have
let
me
have
that
then
she
went
back
into
the
big
bright
sewing
room
splendour
ran
three
years
in
london
during
those
three
years
she
saw
sid
hahn
only
three
or
four
times
he
spent
much
of
his
time
abroad
whenever
opportunity
presented
itself
she
would
say
is
still
playing
in
london
still
playing
the
last
time
hahn
intuitive
as
always
had
eyed
her
curiously
you
seem
to
be
interested
in
that
play
oh
well
josie
had
replied
with
assumed
carelessness
it
being
in
atlantic
city
just
when
i
had
my
accident
and
then
meeting
you
through
that
and
all
why
i
always
kind
of
felt
a
personal
interest
in
it
at
the
end
of
three
years
sarah
haddon
returned
to
new
york
with
an
english
accent
a
slight
embonpoint
and
a
little
foreign
habit
of
rushing
up
to
her
men
friends
with
a
delighted
exclamation
preferably
french
and
kissing
them
on
both
cheeks
when
josie
fifer
happening
back
stage
at
a
rehearsal
of
the
star
new
play
first
saw
her
do
this
a
grim
gleam
came
into
her
eyes
bernhardt
the
only
woman
who
can
spring
that
and
get
away
with
it
she
said
to
her
assistant
haddon
got
herself
sized
up
wrong
gamble
her
next
play
will
be
a
failure
and
it
was
the
scenery
props
and
costumes
of
the
london
production
of
splendour
were
slow
in
coming
back
but
finally
they
did
come
josie
received
them
with
the
calmness
that
comes
of
hope
deferred
it
had
been
three
years
since
she
last
saw
the
play
she
told
herself
chidingly
that
she
had
been
sort
of
foolish
over
that
play
and
this
costume
her
recent
glimpse
of
haddon
had
been
somewhat
disillusioning
but
now
when
she
finally
held
the
gown
itself
in
her
hand
the
original
splendour
gown
a
limp
soft
black
mass
just
a
few
yards
of
worn
and
shabby
velvet
she
found
her
hands
shaking
here
was
where
she
had
hugged
the
toy
dog
to
her
breast
here
where
she
had
fallen
on
her
knees
to
pray
before
the
little
shrine
in
her
hotel
room
every
worn
spot
had
a
meaning
for
her
every
mark
told
a
story
her
fingers
smoothed
it
tenderly
not
much
left
of
that
said
one
of
the
sewing
girls
glancing
up
i
guess
sarah
would
have
a
hard
time
making
the
hooks
and
eyes
meet
now
they
say
she
come
home
from
london
looking
a
little
too
prosperous
josie
did
not
answer
she
folded
the
dress
over
her
arm
and
carried
it
to
the
wardrobe
room
there
she
hung
it
away
in
an
empty
closet
quite
apart
from
the
other
historic
treasures
and
there
it
hung
untouched
until
the
following
sunday
on
sunday
morning
east
street
bears
no
more
resemblance
to
the
than
does
a
stiffly
starched
and
subdued
scholar
to
his
monday
morning
self
strangely
quiet
it
is
and
unfrequented
josie
fifer
scurrying
along
in
the
unwonted
stillness
was
prompted
to
throw
a
furtive
glance
over
her
shoulder
now
and
then
as
though
afraid
of
being
caught
at
some
criminal
act
she
ran
up
the
little
flight
of
steps
with
a
rush
unlocked
the
door
with
trembling
fingers
and
let
herself
into
the
cool
dank
gloom
of
the
storehouse
hall
the
metal
door
of
the
elevator
stared
inquiringly
after
her
she
fled
past
it
to
the
stairway
every
step
of
that
ancient
structure
squeaked
and
groaned
first
floor
second
third
fourth
the
everyday
hum
of
the
sewing
machines
was
absent
the
room
seemed
to
be
holding
its
breath
josie
fancied
that
the
very
garments
on
the
worktables
lifted
themselves
inquiringly
from
their
supine
position
to
see
what
it
was
that
disturbed
their
sabbath
rest
josie
a
tense
frightened
little
figure
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
vast
room
listening
to
she
knew
not
what
then
relaxing
she
gave
a
nervous
little
laugh
and
reaching
up
unpinned
her
hat
she
threw
it
on
a
table
and
disappeared
into
the
wardrobe
room
beyond
minutes
passed
an
hour
she
did
not
come
back
from
the
room
beyond
came
strange
sounds
a
woman
voice
the
thrill
of
a
song
cries
the
anguish
of
tears
laughter
harsh
and
high
as
a
desperate
and
deceived
woman
laughs
all
this
following
in
such
rapid
succession
that
sid
hahn
puffing
laboriously
up
the
four
flights
of
stairs
leading
to
the
wardrobe
floor
entered
the
main
room
unheard
unknown
to
any
one
he
was
indulging
in
one
of
his
unsuspected
visits
to
the
old
wareroom
that
housed
the
evidence
of
past
and
gone
successes
successes
that
had
brought
him
fortune
and
fame
but
little
real
happiness
perhaps
no
one
knew
that
he
loved
to
browse
among
these
pathetic
rags
of
a
forgotten
triumph
no
one
would
have
dreamed
that
this
chubby
little
man
could
glow
and
weep
over
the
garment
of
a
famous
cyrano
or
the
faded
finery
of
a
zaza
at
the
doorway
he
paused
now
startled
he
was
listening
with
every
nerve
of
his
taut
body
what
who
he
tiptoed
across
the
room
with
a
step
incredibly
light
for
one
so
stout
peered
cautiously
around
the
side
of
the
doorway
and
leaned
up
against
it
weakly
josie
fifer
in
the
black
velvet
and
mock
pearls
of
splendour
with
her
blonde
hair
hidden
under
the
romantic
scallops
of
a
black
wig
was
giving
the
big
scene
from
the
third
act
and
though
it
sounded
like
a
burlesque
of
that
famous
passage
and
though
she
limped
more
than
ever
as
she
reeled
to
an
imaginary
shrine
in
the
corner
and
though
the
black
wig
was
slightly
askew
by
now
and
the
black
velvet
hung
with
bunchy
awkwardness
about
her
skinny
little
body
there
was
nothing
of
mirth
in
sid
hahn
face
as
he
gazed
he
shrank
back
now
she
was
coming
to
the
big
speech
at
the
close
of
the
act
the
big
renunciation
speech
that
was
the
curtain
sid
hahn
turned
and
tiptoed
painfully
breathlessly
magnificently
out
of
the
big
front
room
into
the
hallway
down
the
creaking
stairs
and
so
to
the
sunshine
of
street
with
its
unaccustomed
quiet
and
he
was
smiling
that
rare
and
melting
smile
of
his
the
smile
that
was
said
to
make
him
look
something
like
a
kewpie
and
something
like
a
cupid
and
a
bit
like
an
imp
and
very
much
like
an
angel
there
was
little
of
the
first
three
in
it
now
and
very
much
of
the
last
and
so
he
got
heavily
into
his
very
grand
motor
car
and
drove
off
why
the
poor
little
kid
said
he
the
poor
lonely
stifled
little
kid
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
inquired
his
chauffeur
speak
when
you
spoken
to
snapped
sid
hahn
and
here
it
must
be
revealed
to
you
that
sid
hahn
did
not
marry
the
cinderella
of
the
storage
warehouse
he
did
not
marry
anybody
and
neither
did
josie
and
yet
there
is
a
bit
more
to
this
story
ten
years
more
if
you
must
know
ten
years
the
end
of
which
found
josie
a
sparse
spectacled
and
agile
little
cripple
as
alert
and
caustic
as
ever
it
found
sid
hahn
the
most
famous
theatrical
man
of
his
day
it
found
sarah
haddon
at
the
of
a
career
that
had
blazed
with
triumph
and
adulation
she
had
never
had
a
success
like
splendour
indeed
there
were
those
who
said
that
all
the
plays
that
followed
had
been
failures
carried
to
on
the
strength
of
that
glorious
past
she
eschewed
gowns
now
she
knew
that
it
is
the
telltale
throat
which
first
shows
the
marks
of
age
she
knew
too
why
bernhardt
in
camille
always
died
in
a
nightgown
she
took
to
wearing
high
ruffled
things
about
her
throat
and
softening
kindly
chiffons
and
then
in
a
mistaken
moment
they
planned
a
revival
of
splendour
sarah
haddon
would
again
play
the
part
that
had
become
a
classic
fathers
had
told
their
children
of
it
of
her
beauty
her
golden
voice
the
exquisite
grace
of
her
the
charm
the
tenderness
the
pathos
and
they
told
them
of
the
famous
black
velvet
dress
and
how
in
it
she
had
moved
like
a
splendid
buoyant
bird
so
they
revived
splendour
and
men
and
women
brought
their
sons
and
daughters
to
see
and
what
they
saw
was
a
stout
woman
in
a
black
velvet
dress
that
made
her
look
like
a
dowager
and
when
this
woman
flopped
down
on
her
knees
in
the
big
scene
at
the
close
of
the
last
act
she
had
a
rather
dreadful
time
of
it
getting
up
again
and
the
audience
resentful
bewildered
cheated
of
a
precious
memory
laughed
that
laugh
sealed
the
career
of
sarah
haddon
it
is
a
fickle
thing
this
public
that
wants
to
be
amused
fickle
and
cruel
and
paradoxically
enough
true
to
its
superstitions
the
sarah
haddon
of
eighteen
years
ago
was
one
of
these
they
would
have
none
of
this
fat
puffy
woman
who
was
trying
to
blot
her
picture
from
their
memory
away
with
her
cried
the
critics
through
the
columns
of
next
morning
paper
and
sarah
haddon
day
was
done
it
because
i
did
wear
the
original
black
velvet
dress
cried
she
with
the
unreasoning
rage
for
which
she
had
always
been
famous
if
i
had
worn
it
everything
would
have
been
different
that
dress
had
a
charm
where
is
it
i
want
it
i
do
care
if
they
do
take
off
the
play
i
want
it
i
want
it
why
child
sid
hahn
said
soothingly
that
dress
has
probably
fallen
into
dust
by
this
time
dust
what
do
you
mean
how
old
do
you
think
i
am
that
you
should
say
that
to
me
i
made
millions
for
you
and
now
now
now
sally
be
a
good
girl
that
all
rot
about
that
dress
being
lucky
you
grown
out
of
this
part
that
all
we
find
another
play
i
want
that
dress
sid
hahn
flushed
uncomfortably
well
if
you
must
know
i
gave
it
away
to
whom
to
to
josie
fifer
she
took
a
notion
to
it
and
so
i
told
her
she
could
have
it
then
as
sarah
haddon
rose
dried
her
eyes
and
began
to
straighten
her
hat
where
are
you
going
he
trailed
her
to
the
door
worriedly
now
sally
do
do
anything
foolish
you
just
tired
and
overstrung
where
are
you
i
am
going
to
see
josie
fifer
now
look
here
sarah
but
she
was
off
and
sid
hahn
could
only
follow
after
the
showman
in
him
anticipating
the
scene
that
was
to
follow
when
he
reached
the
fourth
floor
of
the
storehouse
sarah
haddon
was
there
ahead
of
him
the
two
women
one
tall
imperious
magnificent
in
furs
the
other
shrunken
deformed
shabby
stood
staring
at
each
other
from
opposites
sides
of
the
worktable
and
between
them
in
a
crumpled
heap
lay
the
velvet
gown
i
do
care
who
says
you
can
have
it
josie
fifer
shrill
voice
was
saying
it
mine
and
i
going
to
keep
it
hahn
himself
gave
it
to
me
he
said
i
could
cut
it
up
for
a
dress
or
something
if
i
wanted
to
long
ago
then
as
sid
hahn
himself
appeared
she
appealed
to
him
there
he
is
now
did
you
hahn
did
you
say
i
could
have
it
years
ago
yes
jo
said
sid
hahn
it
yours
to
do
with
as
you
wish
sarah
haddon
who
never
had
been
denied
anything
in
all
her
pampered
life
turned
to
him
now
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
she
was
breathing
sharply
but
she
cried
i
got
to
have
it
do
you
see
i
want
it
it
all
i
got
left
in
the
world
of
what
i
used
to
be
i
want
it
she
began
to
cry
and
it
was
not
acting
josie
fifer
stood
staring
at
her
her
eyes
wide
with
horror
and
unbelief
why
say
listen
listen
you
can
have
it
i
did
know
you
wanted
it
as
bad
as
that
why
you
can
have
it
i
want
you
to
take
it
here
she
shoved
it
across
the
table
sarah
reached
out
for
it
quickly
she
rolled
it
up
in
a
tight
bundle
and
whisked
off
with
it
without
a
backward
glance
at
josie
or
at
hahn
she
was
still
sobbing
as
she
went
down
the
stairs
the
two
stood
staring
at
each
other
ludicrously
hahn
spoke
first
i
sorry
josie
that
was
nice
of
you
giving
it
to
her
like
that
but
josie
did
not
seem
to
hear
at
least
she
paid
no
attention
to
his
remark
she
was
staring
at
him
with
that
dazed
and
look
of
one
upon
whom
a
great
truth
has
just
dawned
then
suddenly
she
began
to
laugh
she
laughed
a
high
shrill
laugh
that
was
not
so
much
an
expression
of
mirth
as
of
relief
sid
hahn
put
up
a
pudgy
hand
in
protest
josie
please
for
the
love
of
heaven
do
go
and
get
it
i
had
to
do
with
one
hysterical
woman
stop
that
laughing
stop
it
josie
stopped
not
abruptly
but
in
a
little
series
of
recurring
giggles
then
these
subsided
and
she
was
smiling
it
was
at
all
her
usual
smile
the
bitterness
was
quite
gone
from
it
she
faced
sid
hahn
across
the
table
her
palms
were
outspread
as
one
who
would
make
things
plain
i
was
hysterical
i
was
just
laughing
i
been
about
seventeen
years
earning
that
laugh
do
grudge
it
to
me
let
have
the
plot
said
hahn
there
is
any
you
see
it
just
well
i
just
discovered
how
it
works
out
after
all
these
years
she
had
everything
she
wanted
all
her
life
and
me
i
never
had
anything
not
a
thing
she
travelled
one
way
and
i
travelled
in
the
opposite
direction
and
where
has
it
brought
us
here
we
are
both
fighting
over
an
old
black
velvet
rag
do
you
see
both
wanting
the
same
she
broke
off
with
the
little
twisted
smile
on
her
lips
again
life
a
strange
thing
mr
hahn
i
hope
josie
you
do
claim
any
originality
for
that
remark
replied
sid
hahn
dryly
but
argued
the
editor
you
do
call
this
a
cheerful
story
i
hope
well
perhaps
not
exactly
boisterous
but
it
teaches
a
lesson
and
all
that
and
it
sort
of
philosophical
and
everything
do
you
think
the
editor
shuffled
the
sheets
together
decisively
so
that
they
formed
a
neat
sheaf
i
afraid
i
did
make
myself
quite
clear
entertaining
and
all
that
but
ah
in
view
of
our
present
needs
sorry
to
say
we
ii
the
gay
old
dog
those
of
you
who
have
dwelt
or
even
lingered
in
chicago
illinois
this
is
not
a
humorous
story
are
familiar
with
the
region
known
as
the
loop
for
those
others
of
you
to
whom
chicago
is
a
transfer
point
between
new
york
and
san
francisco
there
is
presented
this
brief
explanation
the
loop
is
a
clamorous
district
embraced
by
the
iron
arms
of
the
elevated
tracks
in
a
city
boasting
fewer
millions
it
would
be
known
familiarly
as
downtown
from
congress
to
lake
street
from
wabash
almost
to
the
river
those
thunderous
tracks
make
a
complete
circle
or
loop
within
it
lie
the
retail
shops
the
commercial
hotels
the
theatres
the
restaurants
it
is
the
fifth
avenue
diluted
and
the
broadway
deleted
of
chicago
and
he
who
frequents
it
by
night
in
search
of
amusement
and
cheer
is
known
vulgarly
as
a
jo
hertz
was
a
on
the
occasion
of
those
sparse
first
nights
granted
the
metropolis
of
the
middle
west
he
was
always
present
third
row
aisle
left
when
a
new
loop
caf√©
was
opened
jo
table
always
commanded
an
unobstructed
view
of
anything
worth
viewing
on
entering
he
was
wont
to
say
hello
gus
with
careless
cordiality
to
the
head
waiter
the
while
his
eye
roved
expertly
from
table
to
table
as
he
removed
his
gloves
he
ordered
things
under
glass
so
that
his
table
at
midnight
or
thereabouts
resembled
a
that
favours
the
bell
system
the
waiters
fought
for
him
he
was
the
kind
of
man
who
mixes
his
own
salad
dressing
he
liked
to
call
for
a
bowl
some
cracked
ice
lemon
garlic
paprika
salt
pepper
vinegar
and
oil
and
make
a
rite
of
it
people
at
tables
would
lay
down
their
knives
and
forks
to
watch
fascinated
the
secret
of
it
seemed
to
lie
in
using
all
the
oil
in
sight
and
calling
for
more
that
was
jo
a
plump
and
lonely
bachelor
of
fifty
a
plethoric
and
kindly
man
clutching
vainly
at
the
garments
of
a
youth
that
had
long
slipped
past
him
jo
hertz
in
one
of
those
belted
suits
and
a
trench
coat
and
a
little
green
hat
walking
up
michigan
avenue
of
a
bright
winter
afternoon
trying
to
take
the
curb
with
a
jaunty
youthfulness
against
which
every
one
of
his
muscles
rebelled
was
a
sight
for
mirth
or
pity
depending
on
vision
the
business
was
a
late
phase
in
the
life
of
jo
hertz
he
had
been
a
quite
different
sort
of
canine
the
staid
and
harassed
brother
of
three
unwed
and
selfish
sisters
is
an
under
dog
the
tale
of
how
jo
hertz
came
to
be
a
should
not
be
compressed
within
the
limits
of
a
short
story
it
should
be
told
as
are
the
photo
plays
with
frequent
throwbacks
and
many
to
condense
years
of
a
man
life
into
some
five
or
six
thousand
words
requires
a
verbal
economy
amounting
to
parsimony
at
jo
had
been
the
dutiful
son
in
the
wholesale
harness
business
of
a
widowed
and
gummidging
mother
who
called
him
joey
if
you
had
looked
close
you
would
have
seen
that
now
and
then
a
double
wrinkle
would
appear
between
jo
eyes
a
wrinkle
that
had
no
business
there
at
then
jo
mother
died
leaving
him
handicapped
by
a
promise
the
three
sisters
and
a
house
on
calumet
avenue
jo
wrinkle
became
a
fixture
promises
should
be
broken
as
lightly
as
they
are
seriously
made
the
dead
have
no
right
to
lay
their
clammy
fingers
upon
the
living
joey
she
had
said
in
her
high
thin
voice
take
care
of
the
girls
i
will
ma
jo
had
choked
joey
and
the
voice
was
weaker
promise
me
you
wo
marry
till
the
girls
are
all
provided
for
then
as
joe
had
hesitated
appalled
joey
it
my
dying
wish
promise
i
promise
ma
he
had
said
whereupon
his
mother
had
died
comfortably
leaving
him
with
a
completely
ruined
life
they
were
not
girls
and
they
had
a
certain
style
too
that
is
stell
and
eva
had
carrie
the
middle
one
taught
school
over
on
the
west
side
in
those
days
it
took
her
almost
two
hours
each
way
she
said
the
kind
of
costume
she
required
should
have
been
corrugated
steel
but
all
three
knew
what
was
being
worn
and
they
wore
it
or
fairly
faithful
copies
of
it
eva
the
housekeeping
sister
had
a
needle
knack
she
could
skim
the
state
street
windows
and
come
away
with
a
mental
photograph
of
every
separate
tuck
hem
yoke
and
ribbon
heads
of
departments
showed
her
the
things
they
kept
in
drawers
and
she
went
home
and
reproduced
them
with
the
aid
of
a
seamstress
stell
the
youngest
was
the
beauty
they
called
her
babe
she
really
a
beauty
but
some
one
had
once
told
her
that
she
looked
like
janice
meredith
it
was
when
that
work
of
fiction
was
at
the
height
of
its
popularity
for
years
afterward
whenever
she
went
to
parties
she
affected
a
single
fat
curl
over
her
right
shoulder
with
a
rose
stuck
through
it
years
ago
one
sisters
did
not
strain
at
the
household
leash
nor
crave
a
career
carrie
taught
school
and
hated
it
eva
kept
house
expertly
and
complainingly
babe
profession
was
being
the
family
beauty
and
it
took
all
her
spare
time
eva
always
let
her
sleep
until
ten
this
was
jo
household
and
he
was
the
nominal
head
of
it
but
it
was
an
empty
title
the
three
women
dominated
his
life
they
consciously
selfish
if
you
had
called
them
cruel
they
would
have
put
you
down
as
mad
when
you
are
the
lone
brother
of
three
sisters
it
means
that
you
must
constantly
be
calling
for
escorting
or
dropping
one
of
them
somewhere
most
men
of
jo
age
were
standing
before
their
mirror
of
a
saturday
night
whistling
blithely
and
abstractedly
while
they
discarded
a
blue
for
a
maroon
tie
whipped
off
the
maroon
for
a
and
at
the
last
moment
decided
against
the
in
favor
of
a
plain
because
she
had
once
said
she
preferred
quiet
ties
jo
when
he
should
have
been
preening
his
feathers
for
conquest
was
saying
well
my
god
i
hurrying
give
a
man
time
ca
you
i
just
got
home
you
girls
have
been
laying
around
the
house
all
day
no
wonder
you
ready
he
took
a
certain
pride
in
seeing
his
sisters
well
dressed
at
a
time
when
he
should
have
been
reveling
in
fancy
waistcoats
and
socks
according
to
the
style
of
that
day
and
the
inalienable
right
of
any
unwed
male
under
thirty
in
any
day
on
those
rare
occasions
when
his
business
necessitated
an
trip
he
would
spend
half
a
day
floundering
about
the
shops
selecting
handkerchiefs
or
stockings
or
feathers
or
fans
or
gloves
for
the
girls
they
always
turned
out
to
be
the
wrong
kind
judging
by
their
reception
from
carrie
what
in
the
world
do
i
want
of
a
fan
i
thought
you
did
have
one
jo
would
say
i
have
i
never
go
to
dances
jo
would
pass
a
futile
hand
over
the
top
of
his
head
as
was
his
way
when
disturbed
i
just
thought
you
like
one
i
thought
every
girl
liked
a
fan
just
feebly
just
to
to
have
oh
for
pity
sake
and
from
eva
or
babe
i
silk
stockings
jo
or
you
brought
me
handkerchiefs
the
last
time
there
was
something
selfish
in
his
giving
as
there
always
is
in
any
gift
freely
and
joyfully
made
they
never
suspected
the
exquisite
pleasure
it
gave
him
to
select
these
things
these
fine
soft
silken
things
there
were
many
things
about
this
amiable
brother
of
theirs
that
they
never
suspected
if
you
had
told
them
he
was
a
dreamer
of
dreams
for
example
they
would
have
been
amused
sometimes
by
nine
after
a
hard
day
down
town
he
would
doze
over
the
evening
paper
at
intervals
he
would
wake
to
a
snatch
of
conversation
such
as
yes
but
if
you
get
a
blue
you
can
wear
it
anywhere
it
dressy
and
at
the
same
time
it
quiet
too
eva
the
expert
wrestling
with
carrie
over
the
problem
of
the
new
spring
dress
they
never
guessed
that
the
commonplace
man
in
the
frayed
old
had
banished
them
all
from
the
room
long
ago
had
banished
himself
for
that
matter
in
his
place
was
a
tall
debonair
and
rather
dangerously
handsome
man
to
whom
six
spelled
evening
clothes
the
kind
of
man
who
can
lean
up
against
a
mantel
or
propose
a
toast
or
give
an
order
to
a
or
whisper
a
gallant
speech
in
a
lady
ear
with
equal
ease
the
shabby
old
house
on
calumet
avenue
was
transformed
into
a
brocaded
and
chandeliered
rendezvous
for
the
brilliance
of
the
city
beauty
was
here
and
wit
but
none
so
beautiful
and
witty
as
she
er
jo
hertz
there
was
wine
of
course
but
no
vulgar
display
there
was
music
the
soft
sheen
of
satin
laughter
and
he
the
gracious
tactful
host
king
of
his
own
domain
jo
for
heaven
sake
if
you
going
to
snore
go
to
bed
why
did
i
fall
asleep
you
have
been
doing
anything
else
all
evening
a
person
would
think
you
were
fifty
instead
of
thirty
and
jo
hertz
was
again
just
the
dull
grey
commonplace
brother
of
three
sisters
babe
used
to
say
petulantly
jo
why
do
you
ever
bring
home
any
of
your
men
friends
a
girl
might
as
well
not
have
any
brother
all
the
good
you
do
jo
did
his
best
to
make
amends
but
a
man
who
has
been
for
years
loses
the
knack
somehow
of
comradeship
with
men
he
acquires
too
a
knowledge
of
women
and
a
distaste
for
them
equalled
only
perhaps
by
that
of
an
in
a
department
store
which
brings
us
to
one
sunday
in
may
jo
came
home
from
a
late
sunday
afternoon
walk
to
find
company
for
supper
carrie
often
had
in
one
of
her
friends
or
babe
one
of
her
frivolous
intimates
or
even
eva
a
staid
guest
of
the
type
there
was
always
a
sunday
night
supper
of
potato
salad
and
cold
meat
and
coffee
and
perhaps
a
fresh
cake
jo
rather
enjoyed
it
being
a
hospitable
soul
but
he
regarded
the
guests
with
the
undazzled
eyes
of
a
man
to
whom
they
were
just
so
many
petticoats
timid
of
the
night
streets
and
requiring
escort
home
if
you
had
suggested
to
him
that
some
of
his
sisters
popularity
was
due
to
his
own
presence
or
if
you
had
hinted
that
the
more
kittenish
of
these
visitors
were
probably
making
eyes
at
him
he
would
have
stared
in
amazement
and
unbelief
this
sunday
night
it
turned
out
to
be
one
of
carrie
friends
emily
said
carrie
this
is
my
brother
jo
jo
had
learned
what
to
expect
in
carrie
friends
women
in
the
late
thirties
whose
facial
lines
all
slanted
downward
happy
to
meet
you
said
jo
and
looked
down
at
a
different
sort
altogether
a
most
surprisingly
different
sort
for
one
of
friends
this
emily
person
was
very
small
and
fluffy
and
and
sort
of
well
crinkly
looking
you
know
the
corners
of
her
mouth
when
she
smiled
and
her
eyes
when
she
looked
up
at
you
and
her
hair
which
was
brown
but
had
the
miraculous
effect
somehow
of
being
golden
jo
shook
hands
with
her
her
hand
was
incredibly
small
and
soft
so
that
you
were
afraid
of
crushing
it
until
you
discovered
she
had
a
firm
little
grip
all
her
own
it
surprised
and
amused
you
that
grip
as
does
a
baby
unexpected
clutch
on
your
patronising
forefinger
as
jo
felt
it
in
his
own
big
clasp
the
strangest
thing
happened
to
him
something
inside
jo
hertz
stopped
working
for
a
moment
then
lurched
sickeningly
then
thumped
like
mad
it
was
his
heart
he
stood
staring
down
at
her
and
she
up
at
him
until
the
others
laughed
then
their
hands
fell
apart
lingeringly
are
you
a
emily
he
said
kindergarten
it
my
first
year
and
do
call
me
emily
please
why
not
it
your
name
i
think
it
the
prettiest
name
in
the
world
which
he
had
meant
to
say
at
all
in
fact
he
was
perfectly
aghast
to
find
himself
saying
it
but
he
meant
it
at
supper
he
passed
her
things
and
stared
until
everybody
laughed
again
and
eva
said
acidly
why
do
you
feed
her
it
was
that
emily
had
an
air
of
helplessness
she
just
made
you
feel
you
wanted
her
to
be
helpless
so
that
you
could
help
her
jo
took
her
home
and
from
that
sunday
night
he
began
to
strain
at
the
leash
he
took
his
sisters
out
dutifully
but
he
would
suggest
with
a
carelessness
that
deceived
no
one
do
you
want
one
of
your
girl
friends
to
come
along
that
little
emily
or
something
so
long
i
got
three
of
you
i
might
as
well
have
a
full
squad
for
a
long
time
he
did
know
what
was
the
matter
with
him
he
only
knew
he
was
miserable
and
yet
happy
sometimes
his
heart
seemed
to
ache
with
an
actual
physical
ache
he
realised
that
he
wanted
to
do
things
for
emily
he
wanted
to
buy
things
for
emily
useless
pretty
expensive
things
that
he
could
afford
he
wanted
to
buy
everything
that
emily
needed
and
everything
that
emily
desired
he
wanted
to
marry
emily
that
was
it
he
discovered
that
one
day
with
a
shock
in
the
midst
of
a
transaction
in
the
harness
business
he
stared
at
the
man
with
whom
he
was
dealing
until
that
startled
person
grew
uncomfortable
what
the
matter
hertz
matter
you
look
as
if
you
seen
a
ghost
or
found
a
gold
mine
i
do
know
which
gold
mine
said
jo
and
then
no
ghost
for
he
remembered
that
high
thin
voice
and
his
promise
and
the
harness
business
was
slithering
downhill
with
dreadful
rapidity
as
the
automobile
business
began
its
amazing
climb
jo
tried
to
stop
it
but
he
was
not
that
kind
of
business
man
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
jump
out
of
the
vehicle
and
catch
the
one
he
stayed
on
vainly
applying
brakes
that
refused
to
work
you
know
emily
i
could
support
two
households
now
not
the
way
things
are
but
if
you
wait
if
you
only
wait
the
girls
might
that
is
babe
and
carrie
she
was
a
sensible
little
thing
emily
of
course
i
wait
but
we
must
just
sit
back
and
let
the
years
go
by
we
got
to
help
she
went
about
it
as
if
she
were
already
a
little
matron
she
corralled
all
the
men
she
had
ever
known
and
introduced
them
to
babe
carrie
and
eva
separately
in
pairs
and
she
arranged
parties
at
which
babe
could
display
the
curl
she
got
up
picnics
she
stayed
home
while
jo
took
the
three
about
when
she
was
present
she
tried
to
look
as
plain
and
obscure
as
possible
so
that
the
sisters
should
show
up
to
advantage
she
schemed
and
planned
and
contrived
and
hoped
and
smiled
into
jo
despairing
eyes
and
three
years
went
by
three
precious
years
carrie
still
taught
school
and
hated
it
eva
kept
house
more
and
more
complainingly
as
prices
advanced
and
allowance
retreated
stell
was
still
babe
the
family
beauty
but
even
she
knew
that
the
time
was
past
for
curls
emily
hair
somehow
lost
its
glint
and
began
to
look
just
plain
brown
her
crinkliness
began
to
iron
out
now
look
here
jo
argued
desperately
one
night
we
could
be
happy
anyway
there
plenty
of
room
at
the
house
lots
of
people
begin
that
way
of
course
i
could
give
you
all
i
like
to
at
first
but
maybe
after
a
while
no
dreams
of
salons
and
brocade
and
servitors
and
satin
damask
now
just
two
rooms
all
their
own
all
alone
and
emily
to
work
for
that
was
his
dream
but
it
seemed
less
possible
than
that
other
absurd
one
had
been
you
know
that
emily
was
as
practical
a
little
thing
as
she
looked
fluffy
she
knew
women
especially
did
she
know
eva
and
carrie
and
babe
she
tried
to
imagine
herself
taking
the
household
affairs
and
the
housekeeping
pocketbook
out
of
eva
expert
hands
eva
had
once
displayed
to
her
a
sheaf
of
aigrettes
she
had
bought
with
what
she
saved
out
of
the
housekeeping
money
so
then
she
tried
to
picture
herself
allowing
the
reins
of
jo
house
to
remain
in
eva
hands
and
everything
feminine
and
normal
in
her
rebelled
emily
knew
she
want
to
put
away
her
own
freshly
laundered
linen
and
smooth
it
and
pat
it
she
was
that
kind
of
woman
she
knew
she
want
to
do
her
own
delightful
haggling
with
butcher
and
vegetable
pedlar
she
knew
she
want
to
muss
jo
hair
and
sit
on
his
knee
and
even
quarrel
with
him
if
necessary
without
the
awareness
of
three
pairs
of
maiden
eyes
and
ears
no
no
we
only
be
miserable
i
know
even
if
they
did
object
and
they
would
jo
would
they
his
silence
was
miserable
assent
then
but
you
do
love
me
do
you
emily
i
do
jo
i
love
you
and
love
you
and
love
you
but
jo
i
ca
i
know
it
dear
i
knew
it
all
the
time
really
i
just
thought
maybe
somehow
the
two
sat
staring
for
a
moment
into
space
their
hands
clasped
then
they
both
shut
their
eyes
with
a
little
shudder
as
though
what
they
saw
was
terrible
to
look
upon
emily
hand
the
tiny
hand
that
was
so
unexpectedly
firm
tightened
its
hold
on
his
and
his
crushed
the
absurd
fingers
until
she
winced
with
pain
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
and
they
knew
it
emily
was
the
kind
of
girl
who
would
be
left
to
pine
there
are
too
many
jo
in
the
world
whose
hearts
are
prone
to
lurch
and
then
thump
at
the
feel
of
a
soft
fluttering
incredibly
small
hand
in
their
grip
one
year
later
emily
was
married
to
a
young
man
whose
father
owned
a
large
slice
of
the
prosperous
state
of
michigan
that
being
safely
accomplished
there
was
something
grimly
humorous
in
the
trend
taken
by
affairs
in
the
old
house
on
calumet
for
eva
married
of
all
people
eva
married
well
too
though
he
was
a
great
deal
older
than
she
she
went
off
in
a
hat
she
had
copied
from
a
french
model
at
field
and
a
suit
she
had
contrived
with
a
home
dressmaker
aided
by
pressing
on
the
part
of
the
little
tailor
in
the
basement
over
on
street
it
was
the
last
of
that
though
the
next
time
they
saw
her
she
had
on
a
hat
that
even
she
would
have
despaired
of
copying
and
a
suit
that
sort
of
melted
into
your
gaze
she
moved
to
the
north
side
trust
eva
for
that
and
babe
assumed
the
management
of
the
household
on
calumet
avenue
it
was
rather
a
pinched
little
household
now
for
the
harness
business
shrank
and
shrank
i
do
see
how
you
can
expect
me
to
keep
house
decently
on
this
babe
would
say
contemptuously
babe
nose
always
a
little
inclined
to
sharpness
had
whittled
down
to
a
point
of
late
if
you
knew
what
ben
gives
eva
it
the
best
i
can
do
sis
business
is
something
rotten
ben
says
if
you
had
the
least
bit
of
ben
was
eva
husband
and
quotable
as
are
all
successful
men
i
do
care
what
ben
says
shouted
jo
goaded
into
rage
i
sick
of
your
everlasting
ben
go
and
get
a
ben
of
your
own
why
do
you
if
you
so
stuck
on
the
way
he
does
things
and
babe
did
she
made
a
last
desperate
drive
aided
by
eva
and
she
captured
a
rather
surprised
young
man
in
the
brokerage
way
who
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
marry
for
years
and
years
eva
wanted
to
give
her
her
wedding
things
but
at
that
jo
broke
into
sudden
rebellion
no
sir
no
ben
is
going
to
buy
my
sister
wedding
clothes
understand
i
guess
i
not
broke
yet
i
furnish
the
money
for
her
things
and
there
be
enough
of
them
too
babe
had
as
useless
a
trousseau
and
as
filled
with
extravagant
and
lacy
and
frilly
things
as
any
daughter
of
doting
parents
jo
seemed
to
find
a
grim
pleasure
in
providing
them
but
it
left
him
pretty
well
pinched
after
babe
marriage
she
insisted
that
they
call
her
estelle
now
jo
sold
the
house
on
calumet
he
and
carrie
took
one
of
those
little
flats
that
were
springing
up
seemingly
over
night
all
through
chicago
south
side
there
was
nothing
domestic
about
carrie
she
had
given
up
teaching
two
years
before
and
had
gone
into
social
service
work
on
the
west
side
she
had
what
is
known
as
a
legal
mind
hard
clear
orderly
and
she
made
a
great
success
of
it
her
dream
was
to
live
at
the
settlement
house
and
give
all
her
time
to
the
work
upon
the
little
household
she
bestowed
a
certain
amount
of
grim
capable
attention
it
was
the
same
kind
of
attention
she
would
have
given
a
piece
of
machinery
whose
oiling
and
running
had
been
entrusted
to
her
care
she
hated
it
and
hesitate
to
say
so
jo
took
to
prowling
about
department
store
basements
and
household
goods
sections
he
was
always
sending
home
a
bargain
in
a
ham
or
a
sack
of
potatoes
or
fifty
pounds
of
sugar
or
a
window
clamp
or
a
new
kind
of
paring
knife
he
was
forever
doing
odd
little
jobs
that
the
janitor
should
have
done
it
was
the
domestic
in
him
claiming
its
own
then
one
night
carrie
came
home
with
a
dull
glow
in
her
leathery
cheeks
and
her
eyes
alight
with
resolve
they
had
what
she
called
a
plain
talk
listen
jo
they
offered
me
the
job
of
first
assistant
resident
worker
and
i
going
to
take
it
take
it
i
know
fifty
other
girls
who
give
their
ears
for
it
i
go
in
next
month
they
were
at
dinner
jo
looked
up
from
his
plate
dully
then
he
glanced
around
the
little
dining
room
with
its
ugly
tan
walls
and
its
heavy
dark
furniture
the
calumet
avenue
pieces
fitted
cumbersomely
into
the
flat
away
away
from
here
you
mean
to
live
carrie
laid
down
her
fork
well
really
jo
after
all
that
explanation
but
to
go
over
there
to
live
why
that
neighbourhood
full
of
dirt
and
disease
and
crime
and
the
lord
knows
what
all
i
ca
let
you
do
that
carrie
carrie
chin
came
up
she
laughed
a
short
little
laugh
let
me
that
talk
jo
my
life
my
own
to
live
going
and
she
went
jo
stayed
on
in
the
apartment
until
the
lease
was
up
then
he
sold
what
furniture
he
could
stored
or
gave
away
the
rest
and
took
a
room
on
michigan
avenue
in
one
of
the
old
stone
mansions
whose
decayed
splendour
was
being
put
to
such
purpose
jo
hertz
was
his
own
master
free
to
marry
free
to
come
and
go
and
he
found
he
did
even
think
of
marrying
he
did
even
want
to
come
or
go
particularly
a
rather
frumpy
old
bachelor
with
thinning
hair
and
a
thickening
neck
much
has
been
written
about
the
unwed
woman
her
fussiness
her
primness
her
angularity
of
mind
and
body
in
the
male
that
same
fussiness
develops
and
a
certain
primness
too
but
he
grows
flabby
where
she
grows
lean
every
thursday
evening
he
took
dinner
at
eva
and
on
sunday
noon
at
stell
he
tucked
his
napkin
under
his
chin
and
openly
enjoyed
the
soup
and
the
meats
after
dinner
he
tried
to
talk
business
with
eva
husband
or
stell
his
business
talks
were
the
kind
beginning
well
now
looka
here
take
your
raw
hides
and
leathers
but
ben
and
george
did
want
to
take
your
raw
hides
and
leathers
they
wanted
when
they
took
anything
at
all
to
take
golf
or
politics
or
stocks
they
were
the
modern
type
of
business
man
who
prefers
to
leave
his
work
out
of
his
play
business
with
them
was
a
profession
a
finely
graded
and
balanced
thing
differing
from
clumsy
downhill
style
as
completely
as
does
the
method
of
a
great
criminal
detective
differ
from
that
of
a
village
constable
they
would
listen
restively
and
say
at
intervals
and
at
the
first
chance
they
would
sort
of
fade
out
of
the
room
with
a
meaning
glance
at
their
wives
eva
had
two
children
now
girls
they
treated
uncle
jo
with
tolerance
stell
had
no
children
uncle
jo
degenerated
by
almost
imperceptible
degrees
from
the
position
of
honoured
guest
who
is
served
with
white
meat
to
that
of
one
who
is
content
with
a
leg
and
one
of
those
obscure
and
bony
sections
which
after
much
turning
with
a
bewildered
and
investigating
knife
and
fork
leave
one
baffled
and
unsatisfied
eva
and
stell
got
together
and
decided
that
jo
ought
to
marry
it
is
natural
eva
told
him
i
never
saw
a
man
who
took
so
little
interest
in
women
me
protested
jo
almost
shyly
women
yes
of
course
you
act
like
a
frightened
schoolboy
so
they
had
in
for
dinner
certain
friends
and
acquaintances
of
fitting
age
they
spoke
of
them
as
splendid
girls
between
and
forty
they
talked
awfully
well
in
a
firm
clear
way
about
civics
and
classes
and
politics
and
economics
and
boards
they
rather
terrified
jo
he
did
understand
much
that
they
talked
about
and
he
felt
humbly
inferior
and
yet
a
little
resentful
as
if
something
had
passed
him
by
he
escorted
them
home
dutifully
though
they
told
him
not
to
bother
and
they
evidently
meant
it
they
seemed
capable
not
only
of
going
home
quite
unattended
but
of
delivering
a
pointed
lecture
to
any
highwayman
or
brawler
who
might
molest
them
the
following
thursday
eva
would
say
how
did
you
like
her
jo
like
who
jo
would
spar
feebly
miss
matthews
who
she
now
do
be
funny
jo
you
know
very
well
i
mean
the
girl
who
was
here
for
dinner
the
one
who
talked
so
well
on
the
emigration
question
oh
her
why
i
liked
her
all
right
seems
to
be
a
smart
woman
smart
she
a
perfectly
splendid
girl
sure
jo
would
agree
cheerfully
but
did
you
like
her
i
ca
say
i
did
eve
and
i
ca
say
i
did
she
made
me
think
a
lot
of
a
teacher
i
had
in
the
fifth
reader
name
of
himes
as
i
recall
her
she
must
have
been
a
fine
woman
but
i
never
thought
of
her
as
a
woman
at
all
she
was
just
teacher
you
make
me
tired
snapped
eva
impatiently
a
man
of
your
age
you
do
expect
to
marry
a
girl
do
you
a
child
i
do
expect
to
marry
anybody
jo
had
answered
and
that
was
the
truth
lonely
though
he
often
was
the
following
spring
eva
moved
to
winnetka
any
one
who
got
the
meaning
of
the
loop
knows
the
significance
of
a
move
to
a
suburb
and
a
house
eva
daughter
ethel
was
growing
up
and
her
mother
had
an
eye
on
society
that
did
away
with
jo
thursday
dinner
then
stell
husband
bought
a
car
they
went
out
into
the
country
every
sunday
stell
said
it
was
getting
so
that
maids
objected
to
sunday
dinners
anyway
besides
they
were
unhealthy
things
they
always
meant
to
ask
jo
to
come
along
but
by
the
time
their
friends
were
placed
and
the
lunch
and
the
boxes
and
sweaters
and
george
camera
and
everything
there
seemed
to
be
no
room
for
a
man
of
jo
bulk
so
that
eliminated
the
sunday
dinners
just
drop
in
any
time
during
the
week
stell
said
for
dinner
except
wednesday
that
our
bridge
night
and
saturday
and
of
course
thursday
cook
is
out
that
night
do
wait
for
me
to
phone
and
so
jo
drifted
into
that
dyspeptic
family
made
up
of
those
you
see
dining
in
restaurants
their
paper
propped
up
against
the
bowl
of
oyster
crackers
munching
solemnly
and
with
indifference
to
the
stare
of
the
surveying
them
through
the
brazen
window
and
then
came
the
war
the
war
that
spelled
death
and
destruction
to
millions
the
war
that
brought
a
fortune
to
jo
hertz
and
transformed
him
over
night
from
a
old
bachelor
whose
business
was
a
failure
to
a
prosperous
manufacturer
whose
only
trouble
was
the
shortage
in
hides
for
the
making
of
his
product
leather
the
armies
of
europe
called
for
it
harnesses
more
harnesses
straps
millions
of
straps
more
more
the
musty
old
harness
business
over
on
lake
street
was
magically
changed
from
a
concern
to
an
orderly
hive
that
hummed
and
glittered
with
success
orders
poured
in
jo
hertz
had
inside
information
on
the
war
he
knew
about
troops
and
horses
he
talked
with
french
and
english
and
italian
buyers
noblemen
many
of
them
commissioned
by
their
countries
to
get
supplies
and
now
when
he
said
to
ben
or
george
take
your
raw
hides
and
leathers
they
listened
with
respectful
attention
and
then
began
the
business
in
the
life
of
jo
hertz
he
developed
into
a
ever
keen
on
the
scent
of
fresh
pleasure
that
side
of
jo
hertz
which
had
been
repressed
and
crushed
and
ignored
began
to
bloom
unhealthily
at
first
he
spent
money
on
his
rather
contemptuous
nieces
he
sent
them
gorgeous
fans
and
watch
bracelets
and
velvet
bags
he
took
two
expensive
rooms
at
a
downtown
hotel
and
there
was
something
more
than
grotesque
about
the
way
he
gloated
over
the
luxury
of
a
separate
tap
in
the
bathroom
he
explained
it
just
turn
it
on
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
he
bought
a
car
naturally
a
glittering
affair
in
colour
a
bright
blue
with
pale
blue
leather
straps
and
a
great
deal
of
gold
fittings
and
wire
wheels
eva
said
it
was
the
kind
of
thing
a
soubrette
would
use
rather
than
an
elderly
business
man
you
saw
him
driving
about
in
it
and
rather
awkward
at
the
wheel
you
saw
him
too
in
the
pompeian
room
at
the
congress
hotel
of
a
saturday
afternoon
when
doubtful
and
matrons
in
kolinsky
capes
are
wont
to
congregate
to
sip
pale
amber
drinks
actors
grew
to
recognise
the
head
and
the
shining
round
face
looming
out
at
them
from
the
dim
well
of
the
parquet
and
sometimes
in
a
musical
show
they
directed
a
quip
at
him
and
he
liked
it
he
could
pick
out
the
critics
as
they
came
down
the
aisle
and
even
had
a
nodding
acquaintance
with
two
of
them
kelly
of
the
he
would
say
carelessly
bean
of
the
they
all
afraid
of
him
so
he
frolicked
ponderously
in
new
york
he
might
have
been
called
a
man
about
town
and
he
was
lonesome
he
was
very
lonesome
so
he
searched
about
in
his
mind
and
brought
from
the
dim
past
the
memory
of
the
luxuriously
furnished
establishment
of
which
he
used
to
dream
in
the
evenings
when
he
dozed
over
his
paper
in
the
old
house
on
calumet
so
he
rented
an
apartment
and
expensive
with
a
in
charge
and
furnished
it
in
styles
and
periods
ranging
through
all
the
louises
the
living
room
was
mostly
rose
colour
it
was
like
an
unhealthy
and
bloated
boudoir
and
yet
there
was
nothing
sybaritic
or
uncleanly
in
the
sight
of
this
paunchy
man
sinking
into
the
luxury
of
his
ridiculous
home
it
was
a
frank
and
na√Øve
indulgence
of
senses
and
there
was
in
it
a
great
resemblance
to
the
rolling
eyed
ecstasy
of
a
schoolboy
smacking
his
lips
over
an
sucker
the
war
went
on
and
on
and
on
and
the
money
continued
to
roll
in
a
flood
of
it
then
one
afternoon
eva
in
town
on
shopping
bent
entered
a
small
exclusive
and
expensive
shop
on
michigan
avenue
exclusive
that
is
in
price
eva
weakness
you
may
remember
was
hats
she
was
seeking
a
hat
now
she
described
what
she
sought
with
a
languid
conciseness
and
stood
looking
about
her
after
the
saleswoman
had
vanished
in
quest
of
it
the
room
was
becomingly
and
somewhat
dim
so
that
some
minutes
had
passed
before
she
realised
that
a
man
seated
on
a
raspberry
brocade
settee
not
five
feet
away
a
man
with
a
walking
stick
and
yellow
gloves
and
tan
spats
and
a
check
suit
was
her
brother
jo
from
him
eva
glance
leaped
to
the
woman
who
was
trying
on
hats
before
one
of
the
many
long
mirrors
she
was
seated
and
a
saleswoman
was
exclaiming
discreetly
at
her
elbow
eva
turned
sharply
and
encountered
her
own
saleswoman
returning
not
she
gasped
i
feeling
ill
suddenly
and
almost
ran
from
the
room
that
evening
she
told
stell
relating
her
news
in
that
telephone
devised
by
every
family
of
married
sisters
as
protection
against
the
neighbours
and
central
translated
it
ran
thus
he
looked
straight
at
me
my
dear
i
thought
i
die
but
at
least
he
had
sense
enough
not
to
speak
she
was
one
of
those
limp
willowy
creatures
with
the
greediest
eyes
that
she
tried
to
keep
softened
to
a
baby
stare
and
could
she
was
so
crazy
to
get
her
hands
on
those
hats
i
saw
it
all
in
one
awful
minute
you
know
the
way
i
do
i
suppose
some
people
would
call
her
pretty
i
do
and
her
colour
well
and
the
most
hats
aigrettes
and
paradise
and
feathers
not
one
of
them
under
is
it
disgusting
at
his
age
suppose
ethel
had
been
with
me
the
next
time
it
was
stell
who
saw
them
in
a
restaurant
she
said
it
spoiled
her
evening
and
the
third
time
it
was
ethel
she
was
one
of
the
guests
at
a
theatre
party
given
by
nicky
overton
ii
you
know
the
north
shore
overtons
lake
forest
they
came
in
late
and
occupied
the
entire
third
row
at
the
opening
performance
of
believe
me
and
ethel
was
nicky
partner
she
was
glowing
like
a
rose
when
the
lights
went
up
after
the
first
act
ethel
saw
that
her
uncle
jo
was
seated
just
ahead
of
her
with
what
she
afterward
described
as
a
blonde
then
her
uncle
had
turned
around
and
seeing
her
had
been
surprised
into
a
smile
that
spread
genially
all
over
his
plump
and
rubicund
face
then
he
had
turned
to
face
forward
again
quickly
who
the
old
bird
nicky
had
asked
ethel
had
pretended
not
to
hear
so
he
had
asked
again
my
uncle
ethel
answered
and
flushed
all
over
her
delicate
face
and
down
to
her
throat
nicky
had
looked
at
the
blonde
and
his
eyebrows
had
gone
up
ever
so
slightly
it
spoiled
ethel
evening
more
than
that
as
she
told
her
mother
of
it
later
weeping
she
declared
it
had
spoiled
her
life
eva
talked
it
over
with
her
husband
in
that
intimate
kimonoed
hour
that
precedes
bedtime
she
gesticulated
heatedly
with
her
hair
brush
it
disgusting
that
what
it
is
perfectly
disgusting
there
no
fool
like
an
old
fool
imagine
a
creature
like
that
at
his
time
of
life
there
exists
a
strange
and
loyal
kinship
among
men
well
i
know
ben
said
now
and
even
grinned
a
little
i
suppose
a
boy
got
to
sow
his
wild
oats
some
time
do
be
any
more
vulgar
than
you
can
help
eva
retorted
and
i
think
you
know
as
well
as
i
what
it
means
to
have
that
overton
boy
interested
in
ethel
if
he
interested
in
her
ben
blundered
i
guess
the
fact
that
ethel
uncle
went
to
the
theatre
with
some
one
who
was
ethel
aunt
wo
cause
a
shudder
to
run
up
and
down
his
frail
young
frame
will
it
all
right
eva
had
retorted
if
you
not
man
enough
to
stop
it
i
have
to
that
all
i
going
up
there
with
stell
this
week
they
did
not
notify
jo
of
their
coming
eva
telephoned
his
apartment
when
she
knew
he
would
be
out
and
asked
his
man
if
he
expected
his
master
home
to
dinner
that
evening
the
man
had
said
yes
eva
arranged
to
meet
stell
in
town
they
would
drive
to
jo
apartment
together
and
wait
for
him
there
when
she
reached
the
city
eva
found
turmoil
there
the
first
of
the
american
troops
to
be
sent
to
france
were
leaving
michigan
boulevard
was
a
billowing
surging
mass
flags
pennants
banners
crowds
all
the
elements
that
make
for
demonstration
and
over
the
whole
quiet
no
holiday
crowd
this
a
solid
determined
mass
of
people
waiting
patient
hours
to
see
the
go
by
three
years
of
indefatigable
reading
had
brought
them
to
a
clear
knowledge
of
what
these
boys
were
going
to
is
it
dreadful
stell
gasped
nicky
overton
only
nineteen
thank
goodness
their
car
was
caught
in
the
jam
when
they
moved
at
all
it
was
by
inches
when
at
last
they
reached
jo
apartment
they
were
flushed
nervous
apprehensive
but
he
had
not
yet
come
in
so
they
waited
no
they
were
not
staying
to
dinner
with
their
brother
they
told
the
relieved
houseman
jo
home
has
already
been
described
to
you
stell
and
eva
sunk
in
cushions
viewed
it
with
disgust
and
some
mirth
they
rather
avoided
each
other
eyes
carrie
ought
to
be
here
eva
said
they
both
smiled
at
the
thought
of
the
austere
carrie
in
the
midst
of
those
rosy
cushions
and
hangings
and
lamps
stell
rose
and
began
to
walk
about
restlessly
she
picked
up
a
vase
and
laid
it
down
straightened
a
picture
eva
got
up
too
and
wandered
into
the
hall
she
stood
there
a
moment
listening
then
she
turned
and
passed
into
jo
bedroom
and
there
you
knew
jo
for
what
he
was
this
room
was
as
bare
as
the
other
had
been
ornate
it
was
jo
the
and
in
revolt
against
the
cloying
luxury
with
which
he
had
surrounded
himself
the
bedroom
of
all
rooms
in
any
house
reflects
the
personality
of
its
occupant
true
the
actual
furniture
was
panelled
and
ridiculous
it
had
been
the
fruit
of
jo
first
orgy
of
the
senses
but
now
it
stood
out
in
that
stark
little
room
with
an
air
as
incongruous
and
ashamed
as
that
of
a
pink
tarleton
who
finds
herself
in
a
monk
cell
none
of
those
with
which
bachelor
bedrooms
are
reputed
to
be
hung
no
satin
slippers
no
scented
notes
two
military
brushes
on
the
chiffonier
and
he
so
nearly
hairless
a
little
orderly
stack
of
books
on
the
table
near
the
bed
eva
fingered
their
titles
and
gave
a
little
gasp
one
of
them
was
on
gardening
well
of
all
things
exclaimed
stell
a
book
on
the
war
by
an
englishman
a
detective
story
of
the
lurid
type
that
lulls
us
to
sleep
his
shoes
ranged
in
a
careful
row
in
the
closet
with
a
in
every
one
of
them
there
was
something
speaking
about
them
they
looked
so
human
eva
shut
the
door
on
them
quickly
some
bottles
on
the
dresser
a
jar
of
pomade
an
ointment
such
as
a
man
uses
who
is
growing
bald
and
is
too
late
an
insurance
calendar
on
the
wall
some
mixture
on
the
shelf
in
the
bathroom
and
a
little
box
of
pepsin
tablets
eats
all
kinds
of
things
at
all
hours
of
the
night
eva
said
and
wandered
out
into
the
front
room
again
with
the
air
of
one
who
is
chagrined
at
her
failure
to
find
what
she
has
sought
stell
followed
her
furtively
where
do
you
suppose
he
can
be
she
demanded
it
she
glanced
at
her
wrist
why
it
after
six
and
then
there
was
a
little
click
the
two
women
sat
up
tense
the
door
opened
jo
came
in
he
blinked
a
little
the
two
women
in
the
rosy
room
stood
up
why
eve
why
babe
well
why
did
you
let
me
know
we
were
just
about
to
leave
we
thought
you
were
coming
home
joe
came
in
slowly
i
was
in
the
jam
on
michigan
watching
the
boys
go
by
he
sat
down
heavily
the
light
from
the
window
fell
on
him
and
you
saw
that
his
eyes
were
red
and
you
have
to
learn
why
he
had
found
himself
one
of
the
thousands
in
the
jam
on
michigan
avenue
as
he
said
he
had
a
place
near
the
curb
where
his
big
frame
shut
off
the
view
of
the
unfortunates
behind
him
he
waited
with
the
placid
interest
of
one
who
has
subscribed
to
all
the
funds
and
societies
to
which
a
prosperous
business
man
is
called
upon
to
subscribe
in
war
time
then
just
as
he
was
about
to
leave
impatient
at
the
delay
the
crowd
had
cried
with
a
queer
dramatic
exultant
note
in
its
voice
here
they
come
here
come
the
boys
just
at
that
moment
two
little
futile
frenzied
fists
began
to
beat
a
mad
tattoo
on
jo
hertz
broad
back
jo
tried
to
turn
in
the
crowd
all
indignant
resentment
say
looka
here
the
little
fists
kept
up
their
frantic
beating
and
pushing
and
a
voice
a
choked
high
little
voice
cried
let
me
by
i
ca
see
you
man
you
you
big
fat
man
my
boy
going
by
to
war
and
i
ca
see
let
me
by
jo
scrooged
around
still
keeping
his
place
he
looked
down
and
upturned
to
him
in
agonised
appeal
was
the
face
of
little
emily
they
stared
at
each
other
for
what
seemed
a
long
long
time
it
was
really
only
the
fraction
of
a
second
then
jo
put
one
great
arm
firmly
around
emily
waist
and
swung
her
around
in
front
of
him
his
great
bulk
protected
her
emily
was
clinging
to
his
hand
she
was
breathing
rapidly
as
if
she
had
been
running
her
eyes
were
straining
up
the
street
why
emily
how
in
the
world
i
ran
away
fred
did
want
me
to
come
he
said
it
would
excite
me
too
much
fred
my
husband
he
made
me
promise
to
say
to
jo
at
home
jo
jo
my
boy
and
he
going
to
war
so
i
ran
away
i
had
to
see
him
i
had
to
see
him
go
she
was
her
gaze
was
straining
up
the
street
why
sure
said
jo
of
course
you
want
to
see
him
and
then
the
crowd
gave
a
great
roar
there
came
over
jo
a
feeling
of
weakness
he
was
trembling
the
boys
went
marching
by
there
he
is
emily
shrilled
above
the
din
there
be
is
there
he
is
there
he
and
waved
a
futile
little
hand
it
was
so
much
a
wave
as
a
clutching
a
clutching
after
something
beyond
her
reach
which
one
which
one
emily
the
handsome
one
the
handsome
one
there
her
voice
quavered
and
died
jo
put
a
steady
hand
on
her
shoulder
point
him
out
he
commanded
show
me
and
the
next
instant
never
mind
i
see
him
somehow
miraculously
he
had
picked
him
from
among
the
hundreds
had
picked
him
as
surely
as
his
own
father
might
have
it
was
emily
boy
he
was
marching
by
rather
stiffly
he
was
nineteen
and
and
he
had
a
girl
and
he
did
particularly
want
to
go
to
france
and
to
go
to
france
but
more
than
he
had
hated
going
he
had
hated
not
to
go
so
he
marched
by
looking
straight
ahead
his
jaw
set
so
that
his
chin
stuck
out
just
a
little
emily
boy
jo
looked
at
him
and
his
face
flushed
purple
his
eyes
the
eyes
of
a
took
on
the
look
of
a
sad
old
man
and
suddenly
he
was
no
longer
jo
the
sport
old
hertz
the
gay
dog
he
was
jo
hertz
thirty
in
love
with
life
in
love
with
emily
and
with
the
stinging
blood
of
young
manhood
coursing
through
his
veins
another
minute
and
the
boy
had
passed
on
up
the
broad
street
the
fine
street
just
one
of
a
hundred
bobbing
in
rhythmic
motion
like
sandy
waves
lapping
a
shore
and
flowing
on
then
he
disappeared
altogether
emily
was
clinging
to
jo
she
was
mumbling
something
over
and
over
i
ca
i
ca
do
ask
me
to
i
ca
let
him
go
like
that
i
ca
jo
said
a
queer
thing
why
emily
we
would
have
him
stay
home
would
we
we
would
want
him
to
do
anything
different
would
we
not
our
boy
i
glad
he
enlisted
i
proud
of
him
so
are
you
glad
little
by
little
he
quieted
her
he
took
her
to
the
car
that
was
waiting
a
worried
chauffeur
in
charge
they
said
awkwardly
emily
face
was
a
red
swollen
mass
so
it
was
that
when
jo
entered
his
own
hallway
half
an
hour
later
he
blinked
dazedly
and
when
the
light
from
the
window
fell
on
him
you
saw
that
his
eyes
were
red
eva
was
not
one
to
beat
about
the
bush
she
sat
forward
in
her
chair
clutching
her
bag
rather
nervously
now
look
here

stell
and
i
are
here
for
a
reason

to
tell
you
that

please
have
some
sense
of
decency

gathering
in
jo
face
should
have
warned
her
but
he
was
slumped
down
in
his
chair
in
such
a
huddle
and
he
looked
so
old
and
fat
that
she
did
not
heed
it
she
went
on
you
got

to
consider
your
sisters
and
your
nieces

got
to
his
feet
then
shaking
and
at
what
she
saw
in
his
face
even
eva
faltered
and
stopped
it
was
at
all
the
face
of
a
fat
sport
it
was
a
face
jovian
terrible
you
he
began
ominous
you
he
raised
a
great
fist
high
you
two
murderers
you
did
consider
me
twenty
years
ago
you
come
to
me
with
talk
like
that
where
my
boy
you
killed
him
you
two
twenty
years
ago
and
now
he
belongs
to
somebody
else
where
my
son
that
should
have
gone
marching
by
he
flung
his
arms
out
in
a
great
gesture
of
longing
the
red
veins
stood
out
on
his
forehead
where
my
son
answer
me
that
you
two
selfish
miserable
women
where
my
son
then
as
they
huddled
together
frightened
out
of
my
house
out
of
my
house
before
i
hurt
you
they
fled
terrified
the
door
banged
behind
them
jo
stood
shaking
in
the
centre
of
the
room
then
he
reached
for
a
chair
gropingly
and
sat
down
he
passed
one
moist
flabby
hand
over
his
forehead
and
it
came
away
wet
the
telephone
rang
he
sat
still
it
sounded
far
away
and
unimportant
like
something
forgotten
i
think
he
did
not
even
hear
it
with
his
conscious
ear
but
it
rang
and
rang
insistently
jo
liked
to
answer
his
telephone
when
at
home
hello
he
knew
instantly
the
voice
at
the
other
end
that
you
jo
it
said
yes
how
my
boy
i
all
right
listen
jo
the
crowd
coming
over
i
fixed
up
a
little
poker
game
for
you
just
eight
of
us
i
ca
come
gert
ca
why
not
i
not
feeling
so
good
you
just
said
you
were
all
right
i
all
right
just
kind
of
tired
the
voice
took
on
a
cooing
note
is
my
joey
tired
then
he
shall
be
all
comfy
on
the
sofa
and
he
does
need
to
play
if
he
do
want
to
no
sir
jo
stood
staring
at
the
black
of
the
telephone
he
was
seeing
a
procession
go
marching
by
boys
hundreds
of
boys
in
khaki
hello
hello
the
voice
took
on
an
anxious
note
are
you
there
yes
wearily
jo
there
something
the
matter
you
sick
i
coming
right
over
no
why
not
you
sound
as
if
you
been
sleeping
look
here
leave
me
alone
cried
jo
suddenly
and
the
receiver
clacked
onto
the
hook
leave
me
alone
leave
me
alone
long
after
the
connection
had
been
broken
he
stood
staring
at
the
instrument
with
unseeing
eyes
then
he
turned
and
walked
into
the
front
room
all
the
light
had
gone
out
of
it
dusk
had
come
on
all
the
light
had
gone
out
of
everything
the
zest
had
gone
out
of
life
the
game
was
over
the
game
he
had
been
playing
against
loneliness
and
disappointment
and
he
was
just
a
tired
old
man
a
lonely
tired
old
man
in
a
ridiculous
room
that
had
grown
all
of
a
sudden
drab
iii
the
tough
guy
you
could
not
be
so
very
tough
in
chippewa
wisconsin
but
buzz
werner
managed
magnificently
with
the
limited
means
at
hand
before
he
was
nineteen
mothers
were
warning
their
sons
against
him
and
brothers
their
sisters
buzz
werner
not
only
was
tough
he
looked
tough
when
he
spoke
which
was
often
his
speech
slid
sinisterly
out
of
the
extreme
left
corner
of
his
mouth
he
had
a
trick
of
hitching
himself
up
from
the
belt
one
palm
on
the
stomach
and
a
sort
of
heaving
jerk
from
the
waist
as
a
prize
fighter
does
it
that
would
have
made
a
van
bibber
look
rough
his
name
was
not
really
buzz
but
quotes
are
dispensed
with
because
no
one
but
his
mother
remembered
what
it
originally
had
been
his
mother
called
him
ernie
and
she
alone
in
all
chippewa
wisconsin
was
unaware
that
her
son
was
the
town
tough
guy
but
even
she
sometimes
mildly
remonstrated
with
him
for
being
what
she
called
kind
of
wild
buzz
had
yellow
hair
with
a
glint
in
it
and
it
curled
up
into
a
bang
at
the
front
no
amount
of
wetting
or
greasing
could
subdue
that
irrepressible
forelock
a
boy
with
hair
like
that
never
grows
up
in
his
eyes
if
buzz
real
name
was
lost
in
the
dim
mists
of
boyhood
the
origin
and
fitness
of
his
nickname
were
apparent
after
two
minutes
conversation
with
him
buzz
werner
was
called
buzz
not
only
because
he
talked
too
much
but
because
he
was
a
braggart
his
conversation
bristled
with
the
perpendicular
pronoun
and
his
pet
phrase
was
i
says
to
him
he
buzzed
by
the
time
buzz
was
fourteen
he
was
stealing
brass
from
the
yards
of
the
big
paper
mills
down
in
the
flats
and
selling
it
to
the
junk
man
how
he
escaped
the
reform
school
is
a
mystery
perhaps
it
was
the
blond
forelock
at
nineteen
he
was
running
with
the
kearney
girl
years
hence
chippewa
will
have
learned
to
treat
the
type
as
a
disease
and
a
public
menace
which
she
was
the
kearney
girl
ran
wild
in
chippewa
and
chippewa
will
be
paying
taxes
on
the
fruit
of
her
liberty
for
a
hundred
years
to
come
the
kearney
girl
was
a
beautiful
idiot
with
a
lovely
oval
face
and
limpid
rather
wistful
blue
eyes
and
fair
fine
hair
and
a
long
slim
neck
she
looked
very
much
like
those
famous
wantons
of
history
from
lucrezia
borgia
to
nell
gwyn
that
you
see
pictured
in
the
galleries
of
europe
all
very
mild
and
girlish
with
moist
red
mouths
like
a
puppy
so
that
you
wonder
if
they
have
not
been
basely
defamed
through
all
the
centuries
the
kearney
girl
father
ran
a
saloon
out
on
second
avenue
and
every
few
days
the
chippewa
paper
would
come
out
with
a
story
of
a
brawl
a
knifing
or
a
fight
following
a
saturday
night
in
kearney
the
kearney
girl
herself
was
forever
running
up
and
down
grand
avenue
which
was
the
main
business
street
she
would
trail
up
and
down
from
the
old
armory
to
the
and
back
again
when
she
turned
off
into
the
homeward
stretch
on
outagamie
street
there
always
slunk
after
her
some
furtive
loping
youth
but
he
never
was
seen
with
her
on
grand
avenue
she
had
often
been
up
before
old
judge
colt
for
some
nasty
business
or
other
at
such
times
the
shabby
office
of
the
justice
of
the
peace
would
be
full
of
shawled
mothers
and
fathers
and
an
aunt
or
two
and
some
cousins
and
always
a
slinking
youth
fumbling
with
the
hat
in
his
hands
his
glance
darting
hither
and
thither
from
group
to
group
but
never
resting
for
a
moment
within
any
one
else
gaze
of
all
these
present
the
kearney
girl
herself
was
always
the
calmest
old
judge
colt
meted
out
justice
according
to
his
lights
unfortunately
the
wearing
of
a
yellow
badge
on
the
breast
was
a
custom
that
had
gone
out
some
years
before
this
nymph
it
was
who
had
taken
a
fancy
to
buzz
werner
it
looked
very
black
for
his
future
the
strange
part
of
it
was
that
the
girl
possessed
little
attraction
for
buzz
it
was
she
who
made
all
the
advances
buzz
had
sprung
from
very
decent
stock
as
you
shall
see
and
something
about
the
sultry
unwholesomeness
of
this
girl
repelled
him
though
he
was
hardly
aware
that
this
was
so
buzz
and
his
gang
would
meet
down
town
of
a
saturday
night
very
moist
as
to
hair
and
clean
as
to
soft
shirt
they
would
lounge
on
the
corner
of
grand
and
outagamie
in
front
of
brightly
lighted
drug
store
watching
the
girls
go
by
they
were
for
the
most
part
a
lot
they
would
shuffle
their
feet
in
a
slow
jig
hands
in
pockets
when
a
late
comer
joined
them
it
was
considered
to
welcome
him
by
assuming
a
fistic
attitude
after
the
style
of
the
pugilists
pictured
in
the
magazines
and
spar
a
and
round
with
him
with
much
agile
dancing
about
in
a
circle
head
held
stiffly
body
crouching
while
working
a
rapid
and
facetious
right
this
corner
or
donovan
was
their
club
their
forum
here
they
recounted
their
exploits
bragged
of
their
triumphs
boasted
of
their
girls
flexed
their
muscles
to
show
their
strength
and
all
through
their
talk
there
occurred
again
and
again
a
certain
term
whose
use
is
common
to
their
kind
their
remarks
were
prefaced
and
interlarded
and
concluded
with
it
so
that
it
was
no
longer
an
oath
or
a
blasphemy
je
i
was
sore
at
i
told
him
where
to
get
off
at
nobody
can
talk
to
me
like
that
je
i
should
say
not
so
accustomed
had
it
grown
that
it
was
not
even
thought
of
as
profanity
if
buzz
family
could
have
heard
him
in
his
talk
with
his
companions
they
would
not
have
credited
their
ears
a
mouthy
braggart
in
company
is
often
silent
in
his
own
home
and
buzz
was
no
exception
to
this
rule
fortunately
buzz
braggadocio
carried
with
it
a
certain
conviction
he
never
kept
a
job
more
than
a
month
and
his
own
account
of
his
was
always
as
vainglorious
as
it
was
dramatic
i
says
to
him
you
talkin
to
i
do
have
to
take
nothin
from
you
nor
nobody
like
you
i
says
as
good
as
you
are
any
day
and
better
you
can
have
your
dirty
job
i
says
and
with
that
i
give
him
my
time
and
walked
out
on
je
he
was
sore
they
would
listen
to
him
appreciatively
but
with
certain
mental
reservations
reservations
inevitable
when
a
speaker
name
is
buzz
one
by
one
they
would
melt
away
as
their
particular
girl
after
flaunting
by
with
a
giggle
and
a
sidelong
glance
for
the
dozenth
time
would
switch
her
skirts
around
the
corner
of
outagamie
street
past
the
brill
house
homeward
bound
well
they
would
say
and
lounging
after
her
would
overtake
her
in
the
shadow
of
the
row
of
trees
in
front
of
the
agassiz
school
if
the
werner
family
had
been
city
folk
they
would
perforce
have
burrowed
in
one
of
those
tenements
that
line
block
after
block
of
city
streets
but
your
labouring
man
is
likely
to
own
his
frame
house
with
a
garden
patch
in
the
back
and
a
cement
walk
leading
up
to
the
front
porch
and
pork
roast
on
sundays
the
werners
had
all
this
no
thanks
to
pa
werner
no
thanks
to
buzz
surely
and
little
to
minnie
werner
who
clerked
in
the
sugar
bowl
candy
store
and
tried
to
dress
like
angie
hatton
whose
father
owned
the
biggest
pulp
and
paper
mill
in
the
fox
river
valley
no
the
house
and
the
garden
the
porch
and
the
cement
sidewalk
and
the
pork
roast
all
had
their
origin
in
ma
werner
tireless
energy
in
ma
werner
thrift
in
her
patience
and
unremitting
toil
her
nimble
fingers
and
bent
back
her
shapeless
figure
and
unbounded
and
unexpressed
verbally
that
is
love
for
her
children
pa
werner
sullen
lazy
brooding
tyrannical
she
soothed
and
mollified
for
the
children
sake
or
shouted
down
with
a
shrewish
outburst
as
the
occasion
required
an
expert
by
trade
pa
werner
could
be
depended
on
only
when
he
was
not
drinking
or
when
he
was
not
on
strike
or
when
he
had
not
quarrelled
with
the
foreman
an
anarchist
pa
dissatisfied
with
things
as
they
were
but
with
no
plan
for
improving
them
his
pipe
between
his
lips
he
would
sit
in
silence
smoking
and
thinking
vague
formless
surly
thoughts
this
sullen
unrest
and
rebellion
it
was
that
transmitted
to
his
son
had
made
buzz
the
unruly
braggart
that
he
was
and
which
twenty
or
thirty
years
hence
would
find
him
just
such
a
one
as
his
father
useless
half
brutal
defiant
of
order
it
was
in
may
a
fine
warm
sunny
day
that
ma
werner
looking
up
from
the
garden
patch
where
she
was
spading
a
man
old
battered
felt
hat
perched
grotesquely
atop
her
white
head
saw
buzz
lounging
homeward
cutting
across
lots
from
bates
street
his
dinner
pail
glinting
in
the
sun
it
was
four
in
the
afternoon
ma
werner
straightened
painfully
and
her
face
took
on
a
purplish
tinge
she
wiped
her
moist
chin
with
an
as
buzz
espied
her
his
gait
became
a
swagger
at
sight
of
that
swagger
ma
knew
she
dropped
her
spade
and
plodded
heavily
through
the
freshly
turned
earth
to
the
back
porch
as
buzz
turned
in
at
the
walk
she
shifted
her
weight
ponderously
as
she
wiped
first
one
shoe
and
then
the
other
what
the
matter
ernie
you
ai
sick
are
you
naw
what
you
home
so
early
for
because
i
feel
like
it
that
why
he
took
the
back
steps
at
a
bound
and
slammed
the
kitchen
door
behind
him
ma
werner
followed
heavily
after
buzz
was
hanging
his
hat
up
behind
the
kitchen
door
he
turned
with
a
scowl
as
his
mother
entered
she
looked
even
more
ludicrous
in
the
house
than
she
had
outside
with
her
skirts
tucked
up
to
make
spading
the
easier
so
that
there
was
displayed
an
unseemly
length
of
thick
ankle
rising
solidly
above
the
old
pair
of
men
that
encased
her
feet
the
battered
hat
perched
rakishly
atop
her
knob
of
hair
gave
her
a
jaunty
sporting
look
as
of
a
ponderous
burlesque
watteau
she
abandoned
pretense
ernie
your
pa
be
awful
mad
you
know
the
way
he
carried
on
the
last
time
let
him
he
aint
worked
five
days
himself
this
month
then
at
a
sudden
sound
from
the
front
of
the
house
he
ai
home
is
he
that
the
shade
flapping
buzz
turned
toward
the
inside
wooden
stairway
that
led
to
the
above
but
his
mother
followed
with
surprising
agility
for
so
heavy
a
woman
she
put
a
hand
on
his
arm
such
a
job
ernie
you
said
only
yesterday
you
liked
it
somethin
must
happened
there
broke
a
grim
little
laugh
from
buzz
believe
something
happened
good
an
plenty
a
little
frightened
look
came
into
his
eyes
i
just
had
a
with
young
hatton
the
red
faded
from
her
face
and
a
mask
seemed
to
slip
down
over
it
you
do
mean
hatton
not
hatton
son
ernie
you
done
a
dash
of
his
bravado
came
back
to
him
aw

your
hair
on
ma
i
did
know
it
was
young
hatton
when
i
hit
an
anyway

a
lick
in
his
life
except

to
college

sissy

but
the
first
sentence
only
had
penetrated
her
brain
she
grappled
with
it
dizzily
hit
him
ernie
you
do
mean
you
hit
him
not
son
ernie
sure
i
did
you
oughta

his
face
but
there
was
very
little
triumph
or
satisfaction
in
buzz
werner
face
or
voice
as
he
said
it
course
i
did
know
it
was
him
when
i
done
it
i
dunno
would
it
have
made
any
difference
if
i
had
she
seemed
so
old
and
so
shrunken
in
spite
of
her
bulk
as
she
looked
up
at
him
the
look
in
her
eyes
was
so
strained
the
way
her
hand
brought
her
up
to
her
mouth
as
though
to
stifle
the
fear
that
shook
her
was
so
groping
somehow
so
uncertain
that
paradoxically
the
pitifulness
of
it
reacted
to
make
him
savage
when
she
quavered
her
next
question
what
was
he
doin
in
the
mill
he
turned
toward
the
stairway
again
flinging
his
answer
over
his
shoulder
learnin
the
business
that
what
from
the
ground
up
see
he
turned
at
the
first
stair
and
leaned
forward
and
down
one
hand
on
the
well

me
as
no
an
when

takin
the

but

mirth
in
it
i
bet

enough
wheels
an
delicate
machinery
that
minute
to
set
up
a
whole
new
plant
there
was
nothing
of
mirth
in
the
woman
drawn
face
oh
ernie
god
sake

they
goin
to

to

he
was
half
way
up
the
narrow
stairway
she
at
the
foot
of
it
peering
up
at
him
they
wo
do
anything
i
guess
old
hatton
ai
so
stuck
on
havin
his
swell
golf
club
crowd
know
his
little
boy
was
beat
up
by
one
of
the
workmen
he
was
clumping
about
upstairs
now
so
she
turned
toward
the
kitchen
dazedly
she
glanced
at
the
clock
going
on
toward
five
still
in
the
absurd
hat
she
got
out
a
panful
of
potatoes
and
began
to
peel
them
skilfuly
automatically
the
seamed
and
hardened
fingers
had
come
honestly
by
their
deftness
they
had
twirled
and
peeled
pecks
bushels
tons
of
these
brown
balls
in
their
time
at
pa
came
in
at
six
minnie
she
had
to
go
back
to
the
sugar
bowl
until
nine
five
minutes
later
the
supper
was
steaming
on
the
table
ernie
called
ma
toward
the
ceiling
supper
on
the
three
sat
down
at
the
table
without
waiting
pa
had
slipped
off
his
shoes
and
was
in
his
stockinged
feet
they
ate
in
silence
it
was
a
good
meal
a
european
family
of
the
same
class
would
have
considered
it
a
banquet
there
were
meat
and
vegetables
butter
and
bread
preserve
and
cake
true
to
the
standards
of
the
extravagant
american
household
in
the
summer
the
garden
supplied
them
with
lettuce
beans
peas
onions
radishes
beets
potatoes
corn
thanks
to
ma
aching
back
and
blistered
hands
they
stored
enough
vegetables
in
the
cellar
to
last
through
the
winter
buzz
usually
cleaned
up
after
supper
but
when
he
came
down
he
was
already
and
his
hair
was
wet
from
the
comb
he
took
his
place
in
silence
his
work
shoes
had
been
replaced
by
his
good
tan
ones
evidently
he
was
going
down
town
after
supper
buzz
never
took
any
exercise
for
the
sake
of
his
good
sometimes
he
and
the
lembke
boys
across
the
way
played
a
game
of
ball
in
the
middle
of
the
road
or
in
the
vacant
lot
but
they
did
it
out
of
the
game
instinct
and
with
no
thought
of
their
muscles
gain
but
evidently
there
was
to
be
no
ball
buzz
ate
little
his
mother
forever
between
the
stove
and
the
table
ate
less
but
that
was
nothing
unusual
in
her
she
waited
on
the
others
but
mostly
she
hovered
about
the
boy
ernie

eaten
your
potatoes

how
nice
an
mealy
they
are
do
want
none
ernie

this
morning
naw
lem

i
ai
hungry
he
slouched
from
the
table
minnie
teacup
in
hand
regarded
him
over
its
rim
with
wide
malicious
eyes
i
saw
that
kearney
girl
go
by
here
before
supper
and
she
rubbered
in
like
everything

liar

buzz
unemotionally
i

so
she
went
by
and
then
she
came

times

i
guess
i
ought
to
know
her
anybody
in
town
know
kearney
buzz
had
been
headed
toward
the
front
porch
he
hesitated
and
turned
now
and
picked
up
the
newspaper
from
the
sofa
pa
werner
in
trousers
shirt
and
suspenders
was
padding
about
the
kitchen
with
his
pipe
and
tobacco
he
came
into
the
sitting
room
now
and
stood
a
moment
his
lips
twisted
about
the
the
pipe
gave
warning
that
he
was
about
to
break
into
unaccustomed
speech
he
regarded
buzz
with
beady
narrowed
eyes
you
let
me
see
you
around
with
that
kearney
girl
and
i
break
every
bone
in
your
body
and
hers

hussy
oh

who
had
been

countless
trips
from
the
kitchen
to
the
back
garden
with
water

and
sprinkling
can
sagging
from
either
arm
put
in
a
word
to
stay
the
threatening
storm
now
pa
now
ernie
the
two
men
subsided
into
bristling
silence
suddenly
there
she
is
again
shrilled
minnie
from
her
bedroom
buzz
shrank
back
in
his
chair
old
man
werner
with
a
muttered
oath
went
to
the
open
doorway
and
stood
there
puffing
savage
little
spurts
of
smoke
streetward
the
kearney
girl
stared
brazenly
at
him
as
she
strolled
slowly
by
a
slim
and
sinister
figure
old
man
werner
watched
her
until
she
passed
out
of
sight
you
go
gettin
mixed
up
with
dirt
like
that
threatened
he
and
learn
you

hangin
around

place

water

yourself
buzz
with
a
wary
eye
up
the
street
slouched
out
to
the
front
porch
into
the
twilight
of
the
warm
may
evening
charley
lembke
from
his
porch
across
the
street
called
to
him
goin
down
town
yeh
i
guess
so
ai
you
afraid
of
bein
pinched
buzz
turned
his
head
quickly
toward
the
room
just
behind
him
he
turned
to
go
in
charley
voice
came
again
clear
and
i
hear
you
had
a
with
hatton
son
and
knocked
him
down
some
class
t
you
buzz
even
if
it
does
cost
you
your
job
from
within
the
sound
of
a
newspaper
hurled
to
the
floor
pa
werner
was
at
the
door
what
that
what
that
he
sayin
buzz
cornered
jutted
a
threatening
jaw
at
his
father
and
brazened
it
out
ca
you
hear
good
come
on
in
here
buzz
hesitated
a
moment
then
he
turned
slowly
and
walked
into
the
little
sitting
room
with
an
attempt
at
a
swagger
that
failed
to
convince
even
himself
he
leaned
against
the
side
of
the
door
hands
in
pockets
pa
werner
faced
him
is
that
right
what
he
said
lembke
huh
sure
it
right
i
had
a
with
hatton
an
licked
him
and
my
time
what
you
goin
to
do
about
it
ma
werner
was
in
the
room
now
minnie
passing
through
on
her
way
to
work
again
caught
the
electric
current
of
the
storm
about
to
break
and
escaped
it
with
a
parting
oh
for
the
land
sakes
you
two
always
the
two
men
faced
each
other
the
one
a
sturdy
nearing
twenty
with
a
great
pair
of
shoulders
and
a
clear
eye
a
long
quick
arm
and
a
deft
hand
these
last
his
assets
as
a
workman
the
other
gnarled
prematurely
wrinkled
almost
this
one
took
his
pipe
from
between
his
lips
and
began
to
speak
the
drink
he
had
had
at
wenzel
on
the
way
home
sparked
his
speech
he
began
with
a
string
of
epithets
they
flowed
from
his
lips
an
acid
stream
pick
and
choose
as
i
will
there
is
none
that
can
be
repeated
here
old
man
werner
had
perhaps
been
something
of
a
tough
guy
himself
in
his
youth
as
he
reviled
his
son
now
you
saw
that
son
at
fifty
just
such
another
bitter
old
man
smoking
a
glum
pipe
on
the
back
porch
summer
evenings
and
spitting
into
the
fresh
young
grass
i
do
say
that
this
thought
came
to
buzz
as
his
father
flayed
him
with
his
abuse
but
there
was
something
unusual
surely
in
the
with
which
he
allowed
the
storm
to
beat
about
his
head
something
in
his
steady
unruffled
gaze
caused
the
other
man
to
falter
a
little
in
his
tirade
and
finally
to
stop
almost
apprehensively
he
had
paid
no
heed
to
ma
werner
attempts
at
pacification
now
pa
she
had
said
over
and
over
her
hand
on
his
arm
though
he
shook
it
off
again
and
again
now
pa
but
he
stopped
now
fist
raised
in
a
last
profane
period
buzz
stood
regarding
him
with
his
unblinking
stare
finally
you
through
said
buzz
snarled
pa
i
through
get
to
hell
out
of
here
you
be
hung
yet
you
loafer
a
bum
that
what
get
out
here
i
gettin
said
buzz
he
took
his
hat
off
the
hook
and
wiped
it
carefully
with
the
lower
side
of
his
sleeve
round
and
round
he
placed
it
on
his
head
jauntily
he
stepped
to
the
kitchen
took
a
from
the
little
glass
holder
on
the
table
and
with
this
emblem
of
insouciance
at
an
angle
of
ninety
between
his
teeth
strolled
indolently
nonchalantly
down
the
front
steps
along
the
cement
walk
to
the
street
and
so
toward
town
the
two
old
people
left
alone
in
the
sudden
silence
of
the
house
stared
after
the
swaggering
figure
until
the
dim
twilight
blotted
it
out
and
a
sinister
something
seemed
to
close
its
icy
grip
about
the
heart
of
one
of
them
a
vague
premonition
that
she
could
only
feel
not
express
made
her
next
words
seem
futile
pa
you
ought
to
talked
to
him
like
that
he
just
a
little
wild
he
looked
so
kind
of
funny
when
he
went
out
i
he
looked
so
kind
of
he
looked
like
the
bum
he
is
that
what
no
respect
for
nothing
for
his
pa
or
ma
or
nothing
down
on
the
corner
with
the
rest
of
that
where
he
goin
hatton
ai
goin
to
let
this
go
by
you
see
but
she
on
her
way
to
the
kitchen
repeated
i
he
looked
so
kind
of
funny
he
looked
so
kind
of
considering
all
things
the
happenings
of
the
past
few
hours
at
least
buzz
as
he
strolled
on
down
toward
grand
avenue
with
his
sauntering
gait
did
undoubtedly
look
kind
of
funny
the
rage
of
the
afternoon
and
the
rage
of
the
evening
had
choked
the
furnace
of
brain
and
soul
with
clinkers
so
that
he
was
thinking
unevenly
and
disconnectedly
on
the
surface
he
was
cool
and
unruffled
he
stopped
for
a
moment
at
the
railroad
tracks
to
talk
with
stumpy
gans
the
gateman
the
little
bell
above
shanty
was
ringing
its
warning
so
he
strolled
leisurely
over
to
the
depot
platform
to
see
the
come
in
from
chicago
when
the
train
pulled
out
buzz
went
on
down
the
street
his
mind
was
darting
here
and
there
planning
this
revenge
discarding
it
seizing
on
another
abandoning
that
he
show
he
show
sick
of
the
whole
damn
bunch
anyway
wonder
was
hatton
going
to
raise
a
shindy
let
who
cares
the
old
man
was
a
drunk
that
what
ma
had
looked
kinda
sick
he
put
that
uncomfortable
thought
out
of
his
mind
and
slammed
the
door
on
it
anyway
he
show
out
of
the
shadows
of
the
great
trees
in
front
of
the
agassiz
school
stepped
the
kearney
girl
like
a
lean
and
hungry
cat
one
hand
clutched
his
arm
buzz
jumped
and
said
something
under
his
breath
then
he
laughed
shortly
might
as
well
kill
a
guy
as
scare
him
to
death
she
thrust
one
hand
through
his
arm
and
linked
it

he
jerked
loose
from
her
then
and
was
off
he
ran
one
block
then
after
a
backward
glance
fell
into
a
quick
walk
that
brought
him
past
the
brill
house
and
to
schroeder
drug
store
corner
there
was
his
crowd
spider
and
red
and
bing
and
casey
they
took
him
literally
unto
their
breasts
they
thumped
him
on
the
back
they
bestowed
on
him
the
low
epithets
with
which
they
expressed
admiration

at
one
of
the
bleaching

hitched
himself
up
with
a
characteristic
gesture
and
plunged
into
his
story
his
audience
listened
entranced
interrupting
him
with
an
occasional
je
of
awed
admiration
but
the
thing
seemed
to
lack
a
certain
something
perhaps
casey
put
his
finger
on
that
something
when
at

recital

he
asked

from
down

a
dull
muffled
already
chippewa
wisconsin
had
learned
to
recognise
it
grand
avenue
none
too
crowded
on
this
night
pressed
to
the
curb
to
see
down
the
street
they
stared
toward
the
moving
mass
that
came
steadily
nearer
the
listless
group
on
the
corner
stiffened
into
something
like
interest
company
g
said
red
i
hear
they
leavin
in
a
couple
of
days
and
down
the
street
they
came

headed
for
the
new
armory
for
the
building
of
which
they
had
engineered
everything
from
subscription
dances
and
exhibition
drills
to
turkey
raffles

very
seriously
until

made
up
of

around
in
the
morning
for

grocery

and
to
chippewa
standing
at
the
curb
quite
suddenly
these
men
and
boys
were
transformed
into
something
remote
and
almost
terrible
something
grim

sacred
looking

spider
and
spat
and
laughed
the
company
passed
on
down
the
street
vanished
grand
avenue

its
way
a
little
silence

upon
the
group

his
furtive
eyes
darted
here
and
there
spider
was
of
age
and
spider
had
no
family
to
support
but
spider
had
reason
to
know
that
no
examining
board
would
pass
him
into
the
army
of
his
country
and
it
was
a
reason
of
which
one
did
not
speak
you
only
twenty
ai
you
buzz
he
asked
to
cover
the
gap
in
the
conversation
yeh
silence
fell
again
then
but
i
would
mind

for
a
change

place
makes
me
sick
spider
laughed
you

head
came
up
with
a
jerk
je
i
never

attitude

enlistment
office
right
over
the
golden
eagle
clothing
store
step
up
do
crowd
gents
this
way
buzz
was
staring
at
him
his
gaze
was
fixed
tense
suddenly
he
seemed
to
gather
all
his
muscles
together
as
for
a
spring
but
he
only
threw
his
cigarette
into
the
gutter
yawned
elaborately
and
moved
away
he
said
and
lounged
off
the
others
looked
after
him
a
moment
puzzled
speculative
buzz
was
not
usually
so
laconic
but
evidently
he
was
leaving
with
no
further
speech
i
guess
maybe
he
ai
so
dead
sure
that
hatton
bunch
wo
git
him
for
this
anyway
casey
said
then
raising
his
voice
goin
home
buzz
yeh
but
he
did
not
if
they
had
watched
him
they
would
have
seen
him
change
his
lounging
gait
when
he
reached
the
corner
they
would
have
seen
him
stand
a
moment
sending
a
quick
glance
this
way
and
that
then
turn
retrace
his
steps
almost
at
a
run
and
dart
into
the
doorway
that
led
to
the
flight
of
wooden
stairs
at
the
side
of
the
golden
eagle
clothing
store
a
dingy
room
a
man
at
a
bare
table
another
seated
at
the
window
his
chair
tipped
back
his
feet
on
the
sill
a
pipe
between
his
teeth
buzz
shambling
suddenly
awkward
stood
in
the
door
this
the
place
where
you
enlist
the
man
at
the
table
stood
up
the
chair
in
front
of
the
open
window
came
down
on
sure
said
the
first
man
what
your
name
buzz
told
him
meet
sergeant
keith
he
a
canadian
been
through
the
whole
game
five
minutes
later
buzz
fine
white
torso
rose
above
his
trousers
like
a
great
pillar
unconsciously
his
sagging
shoulders
had
straightened
his
stomach
was
held
in
his
chest
jutted
his
ribs
showed
through
the
flesh
get
some
of
that
pork
off
of
him
observed
sergeant
keith
and
do
in
a
couple
of
fritzes
before
he
through
me
blurted
buzz
struggling
now
with
his
shirt
a
couple
say
you
do
know
me
whaddyou
mean
a
couple
i
can
lick
a
whole
regiment
of
them
beerheads
with
one
hand
tied
behind
me
an
my
feet
in
a
sack
he
emerged
from
the
struggle
with
his
shirt
his
face
very
red
his
hair
rumpled
sergeant
keith
smiled
a
grim
little
smile
keep
your
shirt
on
kid
he
said
and
remember
this
is
a
fist
fight
you
going
into
war
buzz
fumbling
with
his
hat
put
his
question
when
when
do
i
go
for
he
had
signed
his
name
in
his
round
boyish
scrawl
now
listen
to
these
instructions
gasped
buzz
he
was
still
gasping
as
he
reached
the
street
and
struck
out
toward
home
when
the
kearney
girl
again
stepped
out
of
the
he
stared
at
her
as
at
something
remote
and
trivial
i
thought
you
tried
to
give
me
the
slip
buzz
where
you
been
never
mind
where
i
been
she
fell
into
step
beside
him
but
had
difficulty
in
matching
his
great
strides
she
caught
at
his
arm
at
that
buzz
turned
and
stopped
it
was
too
dark
to
see
his
face
but
something
in
his
voice
something
new
and
hard
and
resolute
reached
even
the
choked
and
slimy
cells
of
this
creature
consciousness
now
looka
here
you
beat
it
i
got
somethin
on
my
mind
and
i
ca
be
bothered
with
no
fool
girl
see
do
get
me
sore
i
mean
it
her
hand
dropped
away
from
his
arm
i
did
mean
what
i
said
about
havin
you
up
buzz
honest
t
gawd
i
did
i
do
care
what
you
meant
you
meet
me
night
will
you
buzz
if
i
in
this
town
night
i
meet
you
is
that
good
enough
he
turned
and
strode
away
but
she
was
after
him
where
you
i
goin
to
war
that
where
yes
you
are
scoffed
miss
kearney
then
at
his
silence
you
go
and
do
a
fool
thing
like
that
i
sure
did
when
you
goin
well
of
all
the
big
boobs
sneered
miss
kearney
what
did
you
go
and
do
that
for
search
said
buzz
dully
search
then
he
turned
and
went
on
toward
home
alone
the
kearney
girl
silly
empty
laugh
came
back
to
him
through
the
darkness
it
might
have
been
called
a
scornful
laugh
if
the
kearney
girl
had
been
capable
of
any
emotion
so
dignified
as
scorn
the
family
was
still
up
the
door
was
open
to
the
warm
may
night
the
werners
in
their
moments
of
relaxation
were
as
unbuttoned
and
highly
as
one
of
those
group
pictures
you
see
of
the
robert
louis
stevenson
family
pa
asleep
in
his
chair
ma
dress
open
at
the
front
minnie
in
an
untidy
kimono
sewing
on
this
flaccid
group
buzz
burst
he
hung
his
hat
on
the
hook
wordlessly
the
noise
he
made
woke
his
father
as
he
had
meant
that
it
should
there
came
a
muttered
growl
from
the
old
man
buzz
leaned
against
the
stairway
door
negligently
the
eyes
of
the
three
were
on
him
well
he
said
i
guess
you
wo
be
bothered
with
me
much
longer
ma
werner
head
came
up
sharply
at
that
what
you
done
ernie
enlisted
enlisted
for
what
for
the
war
what
do
you
suppose
ma
werner
rose
at
that
heavily
ernie
you
never
pa
werner
was
wide
awake
now
out
of
his
memory
of
the
old
country
and
soldier
service
there
he
put
his
next
question
did
you
sign
to
it
yeh
when
you
goin
even
pa
werner
gasped
at
that
in
families
like
the
werners
emotion
is
rarely
expressed
but
now
because
of
something
in
the
stricken
face
and
starting
eyes
of
the
woman
and
the
dumbfoundedness
of
the
old
man
and
the
sudden
tender
fearfulness
in
the
face
of
the
girl
and
because
in
that
moment
all
these
seemed
very
safe
and
accustomed
and
somehow
dear
buzz
curled
his
mouth
into
the
sneer
of
the
tough
guy
and
spoke
out
of
the
corner
of
that
contorted
feature
what
did
you
think
i
was
goin
to
do
huh
stick
around
here
and
take
dirt
from
the
bunch
of
you
nix
i
through
there
was
nothing
dramatic
about
buzz
going
he
seemed
to
be
whisked
away
one
moment
he
was
eating
his
breakfast
at
an
unaccustomed
hour
in
his
best
shirt
and
trousers
his
mother
only
half
understanding
even
now
standing
over
him
with
the
coffee
pot
the
next
he
was
standing
with
his
cheap
shiny
suitcase
in
his
hand
then
he
was
waiting
on
the
depot
platform
and
hefty
burke
the
baggage
man
was
saying
where
you
goin
buzz
goin
to
fight
the
germans
hefty
had
hooted
hoarsely
you
are
you
big
bluff
who
you
callin
a
bluff
you
you
i
goin
to
war
i
tellin
you
hefty
still
scoffing
turned
away
to
his
work
well
then
i
guess
it
as
good
as
over
give
old
willie
a
swipe
for
me
will
you
you
bet
i
will
watch
me
i
think
he
more
than
half
meant
it
and
thus
buzz
werner
went
to
war
he
was
vague
about
its
locality
somewhere
in
europe
he
was
pretty
sure
it
was
france
a
line
from
his
fourth
grade
geography
came
back
to
him
the
french
it
had
said
are
a
gay
people
fond
of
dancing
and
light
wines
well
that
sounded
all
right
the
things
that
happened
to
buzz
werner
in
the
next
twelve
months
can
not
be
detailed
here
they
would
require
the
space
of
what
the
publishers
call
a
volume
buzz
himself
could
never
have
told
you
things
happened
too
swiftly
too
concentratedly
chicago
first
buzz
had
never
seen
chicago
now
that
he
saw
it
he
hardly
believed
it
his
first
glimpse
of
it
left
him
cowering
terrified
the
noise
the
rush
the
glitter
the
grimness
the
vastness
were
like
blows
upon
his
defenceless
head
they
beat
the
braggadocio
and
the
temporarily
out
of
him
but
only
temporarily
then
came
a
camp
a
rough
temporary
camp
compared
to
which
the
present
cantonments
are
luxurious
the
united
states
government
took
buzz
werner
by
the
slack
of
the
trousers
and
the
slack
of
the
mind
and
holding
him
thus
shook
him
into
shape
and
into
submission
and
eventually
though
it
required
months
into
an
understanding
of
why
that
submission
was
manly
courageous
and
fine
but
before
he
learned
that
he
learned
many
other
things
he
learned
there
was
little
good
in
saying
aw
to
a
dapper
young
lieutenant
if
they
clapped
you
into
the
for
saying
it
there
was
little
point
to
throwing
down
your
shovel
and
refusing
to
shovel
coal
if
they
clapped
you
into
the
guard
house
for
doing
it
and
made
you
shovel
harder
than
ever
when
you
came
out
he
learned
what
it
was
to
rise
at
dawn
and
go
down
a
dirt
road
for
endless
weary
miles
he
became
an
unit
in
an
village
he
learned
what
it
was
to
wake
up
in
the
morning
so
sore
and
lame
that
he
felt
as
if
he
had
been
pulled
apart
limb
from
limb
during
the
night
and
never
put
together
again
he
stood
out
with
a
raw
squad
in
the
dirt
of
no
man
land
between
barracks
and
went
through
exercises
that
took
hold
of
his
great
slack
muscles
and
welded
them
into
and
in
front
of
him
facing
him
stood
a
slim
of
a
lieutenant
hatless
coatless
tireless
merciless
a
creature
whom
buzz
at
first
thought
he
could
snap
between
thumb
and
finger
like
that
who
made
life
a
hell
for
buzz
werner
until
his
muscles
became
used
to
it
one
three
one
three
one
three
yelled
this
person
and
till
buzz
lungs
were
bursting
his
eyes
were
starting
from
his
head
his
chest
carried
a
sledge
hammer
inside
it
his
screamed
and
his
legs
arms
neck
were
no
longer
parts
of
him
but
horrid
useless
burdens
detached
yet
clinging
he
learned
what
this
person
meant
when
he
shouted
always
with
the
rising
inflection
right
buzz
whupped
with
the
best
of
the
seemed
tireless
long
after
buzz
felt
that
another
moment
of
it
would
kill
him
the
lithe
young
lieutenant
would
be
leaping
about
like
a
faun
and
pride
kept
buzz
going
though
he
wanted
to
drop
with
fatigue
and
his
shirt
and
hair
and
face
were
wet
with
sweat
so
much
for
his
body
it
soon
became
accustomed
to
the
routine
then
hardened
his
mind
was
less
pliable
but
that
too
was
undergoing
a
change
he
found
that
the
topics
of
conversation
that
used
to
interest
his
little
crowd
on
the
street
corner
in
chippewa
were
not
of
much
interest
here
there
were
boys
from
every
part
of
the
great
country
and
they
talked
of
the
places
whence
they
had
come
and
speculated
about
the
places
to
which
they
were
going
and
buzz
listened
and
learned
there
was
strangely
little
talk
about
girls
there
usually
is
when
muscles
and
mind
are
being
driven
to
the
utmost
but
he
heard
men
men
as
big
as
he
speak
openly
of
things
that
he
had
always
sneered
at
as
soft
after
one
of
these
conversations
he
wrote
an
awkward
but
significant
scrawl
home
to
his
mother
well
ma
he
wrote
i
guess
maybe
you
would
like
to
hear
a
few
words
from
me
well
i
like
it
in
the
army
it
is
the
life
for
me
you
bet
i
am
feeling
great
how
are
you
all
ma
werner
wasted
an
entire
morning
showing
it
around
the
neighbourhood
and
she
read
and
reread
it
until
it
was
almost
pulp
six
months
of
this
buzz
werner
was
an
intelligent
machine
composed
of
steel
cord
and
iron
i
think
he
had
forgotten
that
the
kearney
girl
had
ever
existed
one
day
after
three
months
of
camp
life
the
man
in
the
next
cot
had
thrown
him
a
volume
of
kipling
buzz
fingered
it
disinterestedly
until
that
moment
kipling
had
not
existed
for
buzz
werner
after
that
moment
he
dominated
his
leisure
hours
the
hut
had
many
battered
volumes
of
this
writer
buzz
read
them
all
the
week
before
thanksgiving
buzz
found
himself
on
his
way
to
new
york
for
some
reason
unexplained
to
him
he
was
separated
from
his
company
in
one
of
the
great
performed
for
the
good
of
the
army
he
never
saw
them
again
he
was
sent
straight
to
a
new
york
camp
when
he
beheld
his
new
lieutenant
his
limbs
became
fluid
and
his
heart
leaped
into
his
throat
and
his
mouth
stood
open
and
his
eyes
bulged
it
was
young
hatton
harry
hatton
whose
aristocratic
nose
he
had
punched
six
months
before
in
the
hatton
pulp
and
paper
mill
and
even
as
he
stared
young
hatton
fixed
him
with
his
eye
and
then
came
over
to
him
and
said
it
all
right
werner
buzz
werner
could
only
salute
with
awkward
respect
while
with
one
great
gulp
his
heart
slid
back
into
normal
place
he
had
not
thought
that
hatton
was
so
tall
or
so
or
so
he
no
more
thought
of
telling
the
other
men
that
he
had
once
knocked
this
man
down
than
he
thought
of
knocking
him
down
again
he
would
almost
as
soon
have
thought
of
taking
a
punch
at
the
president
the
day
before
thanksgiving
buzz
was
told
he
might
have
a
holiday
also
he
was
given
an
address
and
a
telephone
number
in
new
york
city
and
told
that
if
he
so
desired
he
might
call
at
that
address
and
receive
a
bountiful
thanksgiving
dinner
they
were
expecting
him
there
that
the
telephone
exchange
was
murray
hill
and
the
street
madison
avenue
meant
nothing
to
buzz
he
made
the
short
trip
to
new
york
floundered
about
the
city
found
every
one
willing
and
eager
to
help
him
find
the
address
on
the
slip
and
brought
up
finally
in
front
of
the
house
on
madison
avenue
it
was
a
large
stone
place
and
buzz
supposed
it
was
a
flat
of
course
he
stood
off
and
surveyed
it
then
he
ascended
the
steps
and
rang
the
bell
they
must
have
been
waiting
for
him
the
door
was
opened
by
a
large
man
who
said
well
well
come
in
come
in
my
boy
a
great
deal
as
the
folks
in
chippewa
wisconsin
might
have
said
it
the
stout
old
party
also
said
he
was
glad
to
see
him
and
buzz
believed
it
they
went
upstairs
much
to
surprise
in
buzz
experience
upstairs
always
meant
bedrooms
but
in
this
case
it
meant
a
great
bright
sitting
room
with
books
in
it
and
a
fireplace
very
cheerful
there
were
not
a
lot
of
people
in
the
room
just
a
woman
in
a
soft
kind
of
dress
who
came
to
him
without
any
fuss
and
the
first
thing
he
knew
he
felt
acquainted
within
the
next
fifteen
minutes
or
so
some
other
members
of
the
family
seemed
to
ooze
in
unnoticeably
first
thing
you
knew
there
they
were
they
did
pay
such
an
awful
lot
of
attention
to
you
just
took
you
for
granted
a
couple
of
young
kids
a
girl
of
fourteen
and
a
boy
of
sixteen
who
asked
you
easy
questions
about
the
army
till
you
found
yourself
patronising
him
and
a
tall
girl
who
made
you
think
of
the
vamps
in
the
movies
only
her
eyes
were
different
and
then
with
a
little
rush
a
girl
about
his
own
age
or
maybe
younger
he
could
tell
who
came
right
up
to
him
and
put
out
her
hand
and
gave
him
a
grip
with
her
hard
little
fist
just
like
a
boy
and
said
joyce
ladd
pleased
to
meetcha
mumbled
buzz
and
then
he
found
himself
talking
to
her
quite
easily
she
knew
a
surprising
lot
about
the
army
i
two
brothers
over
there
she
said
and
all
my
friends
of
course
he
found
out
later
quite
by
accident
that
this
boyish
but
strangely
appealing
person
belonged
to
some
sort
of
motor
service
league
and
drove
an
automobile
every
day
from
eight
to
six
up
and
down
and
round
and
about
new
york
working
like
a
man
in
the
service
of
the
country
he
never
would
have
believed
that
the
world
held
that
kind
of
girl
then
four
other
men
in
uniform
came
in
and
it
turned
out
that
three
of
them
were
privates
like
himself
and
the
other
a
sergeant
their
awkward
entrance
made
him
feel
more
than
ever
at
ease
and
ten
minutes
later
they
were
all
talking
like
mad
and
laughing
and
joking
as
if
they
had
known
these
people
for
years
they
all
went
in
to
dinner
buzz
got
panicky
when
he
thought
of
the
knives
and
forks
but
that
turned
out
all
right
too
because
they
brought
these
as
you
needed
them
and
besides
the
things
they
gave
you
to
eat
were
much
different
from
the
things
you
had
for
sunday
or
thanksgiving
dinner
at
home
and
it
was
cooked
the
way
his
mother
would
have
cooked
it
even
better
perhaps
and
lots
of
it
and
paper
snappers
and
caps
and
things
and
much
laughter
and
talk
and
buzz
werner
who
had
never
been
shown
any
respect
or
deference
in
his
life
was
asked
politely
his
opinion
of
the
war
and
the
army
and
when
he
thought
it
all
would
end
and
he
told
them
politely
too
after
dinner
ladd
said
what
would
you
boys
like
to
do
would
you
like
to
drive
around
the
city
and
see
new
york
or
would
you
like
to
go
to
a
matin√©e
or
a
picture
show
or
do
you
want
to
stay
here
some
of
joyce
girl
friends
are
coming
in
a
little
later
and
buzz
found
himself
saying
stumblingly
i
i
kind
of
rather
stay
and
talk
with
the
girls
buzz
the
tough
guy
blushing
like
a
shy
schoolboy
they
did
not
even
laugh
at
that
they
just
looked
as
if
they
understood
that
you
missed
girls
at
camp
ladd
came
over
to
him
and
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
said
that
splendid
we
all
go
up
to
the
ballroom
and
dance
and
they
did
and
buzz
who
had
learned
to
dance
at
places
like
kearney
saloon
and
at
the
mill
shindigs
glided
expertly
about
with
joyce
ladd
of
madison
avenue
and
found
himself
seated
in
a
great
cushioned
talking
with
her
about
kipling
it
was
like
talking
to
another
fellow
almost
only
it
had
a
thrill
in
it
she
said
such
comic
things
and
when
she
laughed
she
threw
back
her
head
and
your
eyes
were
dazzled
by
her
slender
white
throat
they
all
stayed
for
supper
and
when
they
left
ladd
and
joyce
handed
them
packages
that
later
turned
out
to
be
cigarettes
and
chocolate
and
books
and
soap
and
knitted
things
and
a
wallet
and
when
buzz
opened
the
wallet
and
found
with
relief
that
there
was
no
money
in
it
he
knew
that
he
had
met
and
mingled
with
american
royalty
as
its
equal
three
days
later
he
sailed
for
france
buzz
werner
the
chippewa
tough
guy
in
paris
buzz
werner
at
tomb
that
glorious
white
marble
poem
buzz
werner
in
the
place
de
la
concorde
eating
at
funny
little
paris
restaurants
then
a
new
life
life
in
a
drab
little
french
village
sleeping
in
barns
or
stables
or
hen
coops
if
the
french
were
a
gay
people
fond
of
dancing
and
light
wines
he
like
to
know
where
it
came
in
nothing
but
drill
and
mud
mud
and
drill
and
rain
rain
rain
and
old
women
with
tragic
faces
and
young
women
with
old
eyes
and
unbelievable
stories
of
courage
and
sacrifice
and
more
rain
and
more
mud
and
more
drill
and
then
into
it
into
it
with
both
feet
living
in
the
trenches
back
home
in
camp
they
had
refused
to
take
the
trenches
seriously
they
had
played
in
them
as
children
play
bear
under
the
piano
or
table
and
had
refused
to
keep
their
heads
down
but
buzz
learned
to
keep
his
down
now
quickly
enough
a
first
terrifying
stretch
of
this
then
back
to
the
rear
again
more
mud
and
drill
marches
so
long
and
arduous
that
walking
was
no
longer
walking
but
a
dreadful
mechanical
motion
he
learned
what
thirst
was
did
buzz
he
learned
what
it
was
to
be
obliged
to
keep
your
mind
off
the
thought
of
pails
of
water
pails
that
slopped
and
brimmed
over
so
that
you
could
put
your
head
into
them
and
lip
around
like
a
horse
then
back
into
the
trenches
and
finally
over
the
top
very
little
memory
of
what
happened
after
that
a
rush
trampling
over
soft
heaps
that
writhed
some
one
yelling
like
an
indian
with
a
voice
somehow
like
his
own
the
german
trench
reached
at
them
with
his
bayonet
he
remembered
automatically
how
his
manual
had
taught
him
to
jerk
out
the
steel
after
you
had
driven
it
home
he
did
it
into
the
very
trench
itself
a
great
german
struggling
with
a
slim
figure
that
buzz
somehow
recognised
as
his
lieutenant
hatton
a
leap
at
him
like
an
enraged
dog
who
you
shovin
you
big
slob
you
yelled
buzz
i
regret
to
say
and
he
thrust
at
him
and
through
him
the
man
released
his
grappling
hold
of
hatton
throat
and
grunted
and
sat
down
and
buzz
laughed
and
the
two
went
on
buzz
behind
his
lieutenant
and
then
something
smote
his
thigh
and
he
too
sat
down
the
dying
german
had
thrown
his
last
bomb
and
it
had
struck
home
buzz
werner
would
never
again
do
a
double
shuffle
on
corner
hospital
days
hospital
nights
a
wheel
chair
crutches
home
it
was
may
once
more
when
buzz
werner
train
came
into
the
little
depot
at
chippewa
wisconsin
buzz
spick
and
span
in
his
uniform
looked
down
rather
nervously
and
yet
with
a
certain
pride
at
his
left
leg
when
he
sat
down
you
could
tell
which
was
the
real
one
as
the
train
pulled
in
at
the
chippewa
junction
just
before
reaching
the
town
proper
there
was
old
bart
ochsner
ringing
the
bell
for
dinner
at
the
junction
eating
house
well
for
the
love
of
mike
would
that
make
you
laugh
ringing
that
bell
just
like
always
as
if
nothing
had
happened
in
the
last
year
buzz
leaned
against
the
window
to
see
there
was
some
commotion
in
the
train
and
some
one
spoke
his
name
buzz
turned
and
there
stood
old
man
hatton
and
a
lot
of
others
and
he
seemed
to
be
making
a
speech
and
kind
of
crying
though
that
be
possible
and
his
father
was
there
very
clean
and
shaved
and
queer
buzz
caught
words
about
bravery
and
chippewa
pride
and
he
was
fussed
to
death
and
glad
when
the
train
pulled
in
at
the
chippewa
station
but
there
the
commotion
was
worse
than
ever
there
was
a
band
playing
away
like
mad
buzz
great
hands
grown
very
white
were
fidgeting
at
his
uniform
buttons
and
at
the
stripe
on
his
sleeve
and
the
medal
on
his
breast
they
would
let
him
carry
a
thing
and
when
he
came
out
on
the
car
platform
to
descend
there
went
up
a
great
sound
that
was
half
roar
and
half
scream
buzz
werner
was
the
first
of
chippewa
men
to
come
back
after
that
it
was
rather
hazy
there
was
his
mother
his
sister
minnie
too
he
even
saw
the
kearney
girl
with
her
loose
red
mouth
and
her
silly
eyes
and
she
was
as
a
strange
woman
to
him
he
was
in
glittering
automobile
being
driven
down
grand
avenue
there
were
speeches
and
a
dinner
and
later
when
he
was
allowed
to
go
home
rather
white
a
steady
stream
of
people
pouring
in
and
out
of
the
house
all
day
that
night
when
he
limped
up
the
stairs
to
his
hot
little
room
under
the
roof
he
was
dazed
spent
and
not
so
very
happy
next
morning
though
he
felt
more
himself
and
inclined
to
joke
and
then
there
was
a
talk
with
old
man
hatton
a
talk
that
left
buzz
somewhat
numb
and
the
family
breathless
visitors
again
all
that
afternoon
after
supper
he
carried
water
for
the
garden
against
his
outraged
protests
what
folks
think
she
said
you
carryin
water
for
me
afterward
he
took
his
smart
visored
cap
off
the
hook
and
limped
down
town
his
boots
and
leggings
and
uniform
very
spick
and
span
from
ma
werner
expert
brushing
and
rubbing
she
refused
to
let
buzz
touch
them
although
he
tried
to
tell
her
that
he
had
done
that
job
for
a
year
at
the
corner
of
grand
and
outagamie
in
front
of
schroeder
drug
store
stood
what
was
left
of
the
gang
and
some
new
members
who
had
come
during
the
year
that
had
passed
buzz
knew
them
all
they
greeted
him
at
first
with
a
mixture
of
shyness
and
resentment
they
eyed
his
leg
and
his
uniform
and
the
metal
and
ribbon
thing
that
hung
at
his
breast
bing
and
red
and
spider
were
there
casey
was
gone
finally
spider
spat
and
said
buzz

spiel
about
how
you
saved
young
hatton
the
simp
who
says
he
a
simp
inquired
buzz
very
quietly
but
there
was
a
look
about
his
jaw
well
anyway
the
papers
was
full
of
how
you
was
a
hero
say

that
right

his
question

us
about
the
fightin
buzz
is
it
like
they
say
it
was
buzz
werner
great
moment
he
had
pictured
it
a
thousand
times
in
his
mind
as
he
lay
in
the
wet
trenches
as
he
plodded
the
muddy
french
roads
as
he
reclined
in
his
wheel
chair
in
the
hospital
garden
he
had
them
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
his
eyes
brightened
he
looked
at
the
faces
so
eagerly
fixed
on
his
utterance
buzz
they
urged
buzz
opened
his
lips
and
the
words
he
used
were
the
words
he
might
have
used
a
year
before
as
to
choice
there
nothin
to
tell
a
guy

no
time
to
be
scairt
everything
kind
of
come
at
once
and

that
all
there
was
to
it
je
it
was
fierce
they
waited
nothing
more
yeh
but
tell
us
and
suddenly
buzz
turned
away
the
little
group
about
him
fell
back
respectfully
something
in
his
face
perhaps
a
quietness
a
new
dignity
boys
he
said
and
limped
off
toward
home
and
in
that
moment
buzz
the
bully
and
braggart
vanished
forever
and
in
his
place
head
high
chest
up
eyes
clear
limped
ernest
werner
the
man
iv
the
eldest
the
young
cub
leaned
an
elbow
against
the
mantel
as
you
seen
it
done
in
english
plays
and
blew
a
practically
perfect
it
hurtled
toward
me
like
a
discus
trouble
with
your
stuff
he
began
at
once
we
had
just
been
introduced
is
that
it
lacks
plot
been
meaning
to
meet
and
tell
you
that
for
a
long
time
your
characterization
all
right
and
your
dialogue
in
fact
i
think
they
good
but
your
stuff
lacks
if
you
know
what
i
mean
but
in
feeble
people
insides
are
often
so
much
more
interesting
than
their
outsides
that
which
they
think
or
feel
so
much
more
thrilling
than
anything
they
actually
do
bennett
wells
rot
remarked
the
young
cub
briskly
plot
the
thing
there
is
no
plot
to
this
because
there
is
no
plot
to
rose
there
never
was
there
never
will
be
compared
to
the
drab
monotony
of
existence
a
desert
waste
is
as
thrilling
as
a
film
they
had
called
her
rose
fatuously
as
parents
do
their
girl
no
doubt
she
had
been
normally
pink
and
white
and
velvety
it
is
a
risky
thing
to
do
however
think
back
hastily
on
the
roses
you
know
do
you
find
a
startling
majority
still
clinging
sere
and
withered
to
the
family
bush
in
chicago
illinois
a
city
of
two
millions
or
is
it
three
there
are
women
whose
lives
are
as
remote
as
grey
as
unrelated
to
the
world
about
them
as
is
the
life
of
a
georgia
cracker
rose
was
one
of
these
an
unwed
woman
grown
heavy
about
the
hips
and
arms
as
houseworking
women
do
though
they
eat
but
little
moving
dully
about
the
flat
on
sangamon
street
rose
was
as
much
a
slave
as
any
black
wench
of
plantation
days
there
was
the
treadmill
of
endless
dishes
dirtied
as
fast
as
cleansed
there
were
beds
and
beds
and
beds
gravies
and
soups
and
stews
and
always
the
querulous
voice
of
the
sick
woman
in
the
front
bedroom
demanding
another
hot
water
bag
rose
day
was
punctuated
by
hot
water
bags
they
dotted
her
waking
hours
she
filled
hot
water
bags
automatically
like
a
machine
water
to
the
top
then
one
hand
clutching
the
bag
slippery
middle
while
the
other
with
a
deft
twist
ejected
the
air
within
a
quick
twirl
of
the
metal
stopper
the
bag
released
squirming
and
finally
its
plump
and
rufous
cheeks
wiped
dry
is
that
too
hot
for
you
ma
where
you
want
it
your
head
or
your
feet
a
spinster
nearing
forty
living
thus
must
have
her
memories
one
precious
memory
at
least
or
she
dies
rose
had
hers
she
hugged
it
close
the
l
trains
roared
by
not
thirty
feet
from
her
kitchen
door
alley
and
yard
and
street
sent
up
their
noises
to
her
the
life
of
chicago
millions
yelped
at
her
heels
on
rose
face
was
the
vague
mute
look
of
the
woman
whose
days
are
spent
indoors
at
sordid
tasks
at
every
night
that
look
lifted
for
an
hour
at
they
came
home
floss
and
al
and
pa
their
faces
stamped
with
the
marks
that
come
from
a
day
spent
in
shop
and
factory
they
brought
with
them
the
crumbs
and
husks
of
the
day
happenings
and
these
they
flung
carelessly
before
the
rose
and
she
ate
them
gratefully
they
came
in
with
a
rush
hungry
fagged
grimed
imperious
smelling
of
the
city
there
was
a
slamming
of
doors
a
banging
of
drawers
a
clatter
of
tongues
quarrelling
laughter
a
brief
visit
to
the
sick
room
the
thin
complaining
voice
reciting
its
tale
of
the
discomfort
and
pain
then
supper
guess
who
i
waited
on
floss
might
demand
rose
dishing
up
would
pause
interested
who
gladys
moraine
i
knew
her
the
minute
she
came
down
the
aisle
i
saw
her
last
year
when
she
was
playing
in
wives
she
prettier
off
than
on
i
think
i
waited
on
her
and
the
other
girls
were
wild
she
bought
a
dozen
pairs
of
white
kids
and
made
me
give
to
her
huge
so
she
could
shove
her
hand
right
into
like
a
man
does
two
sizes
too
big
all
the
swells
wear
that
way
and
only
one
ring
an
emerald
the
size
of
a
dime
what
she
wear
rose
dull
face
was
almost
animated
ah
yes
in
a
dreamy
falsetto
from
al
what
she
wear
oh
shut
up
al
just
a
suit
kind
of
plain
and
yet
you
notice
it
and
sables
and
a
gladys
moraine
hat
everything
quiet
and
plain
and
dark
and
yet
she
looked
like
a
million
dollars
i
felt
like
a
roach
while
i
was
waiting
on
her
though
she
was
awfully
sweet
to
me
or
perhaps
al
the
would
descend
from
his
heights
to
mingle
a
brief
moment
in
the
family
talk
al
clerked
in
the
national
cigar
company
store
at
clark
and
madison
his
was
the
wisdom
of
the
snake
the
weasel
and
the
sphinx
a
strangely
silent
young
man
this
al
perfumed
slim
of
waist
flat
of
hip
narrow
of
shoulder
his
was
the
figure
of
the
born
he
walked
lightly
on
the
balls
of
his
feet
like
an
indian
but
without
the
indian
dignity
some
excitement
ourselves
down
at
the
store
believe
me
the
old
man
son
started
in
to
learn
the
retail
selling
end
of
the
business
back
of
the
showcase
with
the
rest
of
us
waiting
on
trade
and
looking
like
a
yale
yell
pa
would
put
down
his
paper
to
stare
over
his
reading
specs
at
al
mannheim
son
the
president
yep
and
i
guess
he
loves
it
huh
the
old
man
wants
him
to
learn
the
business
from
the
ground
up
i
bet
he
never
get
higher
than
the
first
floor
he
went
out
to
lunch
at
one
and
never
shows
up
again
till
four
wears
english
collars
and
smokes
a
brand
of
cigarettes
we
do
carry
thus
was
the
world
brought
to
rose
her
sallow
cheek
would
show
a
faint
hint
of
colour
as
she
sipped
her
tea
at
on
a
monday
morning
in
late
april
remember
going
to
happen
rose
smothered
her
alarm
clock
at
the
first
warning
snarl
she
was
at
once
as
are
those
whose
yesterdays
and
are
all
alike
rose
never
opened
her
eyes
to
the
dim
tantalising
of
a
something
delightful
or
a
something
harrowing
in
store
for
her
that
day
for
one
to
whom
the
tuesday
visitation
is
the
event
of
the
week
and
in
whose
bosom
the
delivery
boy
hoarse
as
he
hurls
soap
and
cabbage
on
the
kitchen
table
arouses
a
wild
flurry
there
can
be
very
little
thrill
on
awakening
rose
slept
on
the
in
the
that
fact
in
itself
rises
her
status
in
the
family
this
monday
morning
she
opened
her
eyes
with
what
might
be
called
a
start
if
rose
were
any
other
sort
of
heroine
something
had
happened
or
was
happening
it
was
the
six
steam
hissing
in
the
radiator
she
was
accustomed
to
that
the
rattle
of
the
l
trains
and
the
milkman
artillery
disturbed
her
as
little
as
does
the
chirping
of
the
birds
the
farmer
daughter
a
sensation
new
yet
familiar
delicious
yet
painful
held
her
she
groped
to
define
it
lying
there
her
gaze
wandering
over
the
expanse
of
the
grey
woollen
blanket
fixed
upon
a
small
black
object
trembling
there
the
knowledge
that
came
to
her
then
had
come
many
weeks
before
in
a
hundred
subtle
and
exquisite
ways
to
those
who
dwell
in
the
open
places
rose
eyes
narrowed
craftily
craftily
stealthily
she
sat
up
one
hand
raised
her
eyes
still
fixed
on
the
quivering
spot
the
hand
descended
but
not
quickly
enough
the
black
spot
vanished
it
sped
toward
the
open
window
through
that
window
there
came
a
balmy
softness
made
up
of
lake
michigan
zephyr
and
stockyards
smell
and
distant
budding
things
rose
had
failed
to
swat
the
first
fly
of
the
season
spring
had
come
as
she
got
out
of
bed
and
across
the
room
on
her
heels
to
shut
the
window
she
glanced
out
into
the
quiet
street
her
city
eyes
untrained
to
nature
hints
failed
to
notice
that
the
scraggy
oak
that
sprang
somehow
miraculously
from
the
mangey
little
in
front
of
the
building
had
developed
surprising
things
all
over
its
scrawny
branches
overnight
but
she
did
see
that
the
front
windows
of
the
flat
building
across
the
way
were
bare
of
the
lace
curtains
that
had
hung
there
the
day
before
house
cleaning
well
most
decidedly
spring
had
come
rose
was
the
household
aurora
following
the
donning
of
her
limp
and
obscure
garments
it
was
rose
daily
duty
to
tear
the
silent
family
from
its
slumbers
ma
was
always
awake
her
sick
eyes
fixed
hopefully
on
the
door
for
fourteen
years
it
had
been
the
same
sleeping
sleeping
i
have
closed
an
eye
all
night
rose
had
learned
not
to
dispute
that
statement
it
spring
out
i
going
to
clean
the
closets
and
the
bureau
drawers
i
have
your
coffee
in
a
jiffy
do
you
feel
like
getting
up
and
sitting
out
on
the
back
porch
toward
noon
maybe
on
her
way
kitchenward
she
stopped
for
a
sharp
tattoo
at
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
pa
and
al
slept
a
sleepy
grunt
of
remonstrance
rewarded
her
she
came
to
floss
door
turned
the
knob
softly
peered
in
floss
was
sleeping
as
twenty
sleeps
deeply
dreamlessly
one
slim
bare
arm
outflung
the
lashes
resting
ever
so
lightly
on
the
delicate
curve
of
cheek
as
she
lay
there
asleep
in
her
disordered
bedroom
her
clothes
strewing
chair
dresser
floor
floss
tastes
mental
equipment
spiritual
innermost
thoughts
were
as
plainly
to
be
read
by
the
observer
as
though
she
had
been
scientifically
charted
by
a
a
metaphysician
and
her
dearest
girl
friend

to

stirred

faintly
dropped
into

again
fifteen
minutes
later
the

set
the

the
morning
paper
brought
from
the
back
porch
to
ma
rose
had
heard
none
of
the
sounds
that
proclaimed
the
family
astir
the
banging
of
drawers
the
rush
of
running
water
the
slap
of
slippered
feet
a
peep
of
enquiry
into
the
depths
of
the
coffee
pot
the
gas
turned
to
a
circle
of
blue
beads
and
she
was
down
the
hall
to
sound
the
second
alarm
floss
you
know
if
al
once
gets
into
the
bathroom
floss
sat
up
in
bed
her
eyes
still
closed
she
made
little
clucking
sounds
with
her
tongue
and
lips
as
a
baby
does
when
it
wakes
drugged
with
sleep
hair
tousled
muscles
sagging
at
seven
in
the
morning
the
most
trying
hour
in
the
day
for
a
woman
floss
was
still
triumphantly
pretty
she
had
on
one
of
those
absurd
pink
muslin
nightgowns
artfully
designed
to
look
like
cr√™pe
de
chine
you
seen
them
rosily
displayed
in
the
cheaper
shop
windows
marked
cents
and
you
may
have
wondered
who
might
buy
them
forgetting
that
there
is
an
imitation
mind
for
every
imitation
article
in
the
world
rose
stooped
picked
up
a
pair
of
silk
stockings
from
the
floor
and
ran
an
investigating
hand
through
to
heel
and
toe
she
plucked
a
soiled
pink
blouse
off
the
back
of
a
chair
eyed
it
critically
and
tucked
it
under
her
arm
with
the
stockings
did
you
have
a
good
time
last
night
floss
yawned
elaborately
stretched
her
slim
arms
high
above
her
head
then
with
a
desperate
effort
flung
back
the
swung
her
legs
over
the
side
of
the
bed
and
slipped
her
toes
into
the
shabby
pomponed
slippers
that
lay
on
the
floor
i
say
did
you
have
a

oh
lord
i
do
know
i
guess
so
snapped
floss
temperamentally
floss
was
not
at
her
best
at
seven
on
monday
morning
rose
did
not
pursue
the
subject
she
tried
another
tack
it
as
mild
as
summer
out
i
see
the
werners
and
the
burkes
are
housecleaning
i
thought
i
start
with
the
closets
and
the
bureau
drawers
you
could
wear
your
blue
this
morning
if
it
was
pressed
floss
yawned
again
disinterestedly
and
folded
her
kimono
about
her
go
as
far
as
you
like
only
do
put
things
back
in
my
closet
so
i
ca
ever
find
again
i
wish
you
press
that
blue
skirt
and
wash
out
the
georgette
cr√™pe
waist
i
might
need
it
the
blouse
and
skirt
and
stockings
under
her
arm
rose
went
back
to
the
kitchen
to
prepare
her
mother
breakfast
tray
wafted
back
to
her
came
the
acrid
odour
of
pa
matutinal
pipe
and
the
accustomed
bickering
between
al
and
floss
over
the
possession
of
the
bathroom
what
do
you
think
this
is
anyway
a
turkish
bath
shave
in
your
own
room
between
floss
and
al
there
existed
a
feud
that
lifted
only
when
a
third
member
of
the
family
turned
against
either
of
them
immediately
they
and
stood
united
against
the
offender
pa
was
the
first
to
demand
breakfast
as
always
very
neat
was
pa
and
fussy
and
strangely
young
looking
to
be
the
husband
of
the
woman
who
lay
in
the
front
bedroom
pa
had
two
manias
the
movies
and
a
passion
for
purchasing
new
and
complicated
household
utensils
he
haunted
department
store
basements
in
search
of
them
he
opened
his
paper
now
and
glanced
at
the
and
at
the
monday
morning
ads
i
see
the
fair
got
a
spring
housecleaning
sale
they
advertise
a
new
kind
of
extension
curtain
rod
and
scouro
three
cakes
for
a
dime
if
you
waste
one
cent
more
on
truck
like
that
rose
protested
placing
his
breakfast
before
him
when
half
the
time
i
ca
make
the
housekeeping
money
last
through
the
week
your
ma
did
it
fourteen
years
ago
liver
was
cents
a
pound
retorted
rose
and
besides
scramble
yelled
al
from
the
bedroom
by
way
of
warning
there
was
very
little
talk
after
that
the
energies
of
three
of
them
were
directed
toward
reaching
the
waiting
desk
or
counter
on
time
the
energy
of
one
toward
making
that
accomplishment
easy
the
front
door
slammed
once
that
was
pa
on
his
way
slammed
again
al
floss
rushed
into
the
fastening
the
of
her
skirt
her
hat
already
on
rose
always
had
a
rather
special
breakfast
for
floss
floss
posed
as
being
a
rather
special
person
she
always
breakfasted
last
and
late
floss
was
a
fastidiousness
which
shrinks
at
badly
served
food
a
spotted
or
a
last
year
hat
while
it
overlooks
a
rent
in
an
undergarment
or
the
accumulated
dust
in
a
hairbrush
her
blouse
was
of
the
sheerest
her
hair
shone
in
waves
about
her
delicate
checks
she
ate
her
orange
and
sipped
her
very
special
coffee
and
made
a
little
face
over
her
egg
that
had
been
shirred
in
the
oven
or
in
some
way
highly
specialised
then
the
front
door
slammed
again
a
this
time
floss
never
did
quite
close
a
door
rose
followed
her
down
the
hall
shut
and
bolted
it
chicago
fashion
the
sick
woman
in
the
front
bedroom
had
dropped
into
one
of
her
fitful
morning
dozes
at
eight
the
little
flat
was
very
still
if
you
knew
nothing
about
rose
if
you
had
not
already
been
told
that
she
slept
on
the
davenport
that
she
was
taken
for
granted
as
the
family
drudge
that
she
was
in
that
household
merely
an
intelligent
machine
that
made
beds
fried
eggs
filled
hot
water
bags
you
would
get
a
characterization
of
her
from
this
she
was
the
sort
of
person
who
never
has
a
closet
or
bureau
drawer
all
her
own
her
few
and
negligible
garments
hung
apologetically
in
obscure
corners
of
closets
dedicated
to
her
sister
wardrobe
or
her
brother
or
her
spruce
and
fussy
old
father
vague
personal
belongings
such
as
combings
handkerchiefs
a
spectacle
case
a
hairbrush
were
found
tucked
away
in
a
desk
a
table
drawer
or
on
the
top
shelf
in
the
bathroom
as
she
pulled
the
disfiguring
blue
gingham
over
her
hair
now
and
rolled
her
sleeves
to
her
elbows
you
would
never
have
dreamed
that
rose
was
embarking
upon
her
great
adventure
you
would
never
have
guessed
that
the
closet
cleaning
was
to
give
to
rose
a
thrill
as
delicious
as
it
was
exquisitely
painful
but
rose
knew
and
so
she
teased
herself
and
tried
not
to
think
of
the
pasteboard
box
on
the
shelf
in
the
hall
closet
under
the
pile
of
reserve
blankets
and
told
herself
that
she
would
leave
that
closet
until
the
last
when
she
would
have
to
hurry
over
it
when
you
clean
closets
and
bureau
drawers
thoroughly
you
have
to
carry
things
out
to
the
back
porch
and
flap
them
rose
was
that
sort
of
housekeeper
she
leaned
over
the
porch
railing
and
flapped
things
so
that
the
dust
motes
spun
and
swirled
in
the
sunshine
rose
arms
worked
up
and
down
energetically
then
less
energetically
finally
ceased
their
motion
altogether
she
leaned
idle
elbows
on
the
porch
railing
and
gazed
down
into
the
yard
below
with
a
look
in
her
eyes
such
as
no
squalid
chicago
back
yard
with
its
dusty
d√©bris
could
summon
even
in
the
woman
next
door
came
out
on
her
back
porch
that
adjoined
rose
the
day
seemed
to
have
her
in
its
spell
too
for
in
her
hand
was
something
woolly
and
wintry
and
she
began
to
flap
it
about
as
rose
had
done
she
had
lived
next
door
since
october
had
that
woman
but
the
two
had
never
exchanged
a
word
true
to
the
traditions
of
their
city
training
rose
had
her
doubts
of
the
woman
next
door
she
kept
a
toy
dog
which
she
aired
afternoons
and
her
kimonos
were
florid
and
numerous
now
as
the
eyes
of
the
two
women
met
rose
found
herself
saying
looks
like
summer
the
woman
next
door
caught
the
scrap
of
conversation
eagerly
hungrily
it
certainly
does
makes
me
feel
like
new
clothes
and
housecleaning
i
started
said
rose
triumphantly
not
already
gasped
the
woman
next
door
with
the
chagrin
that
only
a
woman
knows
who
has
let
may
steal
upon
her
unawares
from
far
down
the
alley
sounded
a
chant
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
until
there
shambled
into
view
a
decrepit
horse
drawing
a
dilapidated
huckster
cart
perched
on
the
seat
was
a
greek
who
turned
his
dusky
face
up
toward
the
two
women
leaning
over
the
porch
railings
rhubarb
leddy
fresh
rhubarb
my
folks
do
care
for
rhubarb
sauce
rose
told
the
woman
next
door
it
makes
the
worst
pie
in
the
world
the
woman
confided
to
rose
whereupon
each
bought
a
bunch
of
the
succulent
green
and
red
stalks
it
was
their
offering
at
the
season
shrine
rose
flung
the
rhubarb
on
the
kitchen
table
pulled
her
more
firmly
about
her
ears
and
hurried
back
to
the
disorder
of
floss
dim
little
bedroom
after
that
it
was
and
soapsuds
and
in
a
race
against
recurrent
water
bags
insistent
doorbells
and
the
inevitable
dinner
hour
it
was
when
rose
standing
on
a
chair
came
at
last
to
the
little
box
on
the
top
shelf
under
the
bedding
in
the
hall
closet
her
hand
touched
the
box
and
closed
about
it
a
little
electric
thrill
vibrated
through
her
body
she
stepped
down
from
the
chair
heavily
listened
until
her
acute
ear
caught
the
sound
of
the
sick
woman
slumbrous
breathing
then
box
in
hand
walked
down
the
dark
hall
to
the
kitchen
the
rhubarb
pie
still
steaming
in
its
pan
was
cooling
on
the
kitchen
table
the
dishes
from
the
invalid
littered
the
sink
but
rose
seated
on
the
kitchen
chair
her
rumpled
pushed
back
from
her
flushed
perspiring
face
untied
the
rude
bit
of
string
that
bound
the
old
candy
box
removed
the
lid
slowly
and
by
that
act
was
wafted
magically
out
of
the
world
of
rhubarb
pies
and
kitchen
chairs
and
dirty
dishes
into
that
place
whose
air
is
the
breath
of
incense
and
myrrh
whose
paths
are
whose
dwellings
are
temples
dedicated
to
but
one
small
god
the
land
is
known
as
love
and
rose
travelled
back
to
it
on
the
magic
rug
of
memory
a
family
of
five
in
a
chicago
flat
must
sacrifice
sentiment
to
necessity
there
is
precious
little
space
for
those
pressed
flowers
gowns
and
packets
that
figured
so
prominently
in
the
days
of
attics
into
the
garbage
can
with
roses
the
janitor
burlap
sack
yawns
for
this
morning
mail
last
year
gown
has
long
ago
met
its
end
at
the
hands
of
the
man
or
the
daughter
that
they
had
survived
these
fourteen
years
and
the
strictures
of
their
owner
dwelling
tells
more
about
this
boxful
of
letters
than
could
be
conveyed
by
a
battalion
of
adjectives
rose
began
at
the
top
of
the
pile
in
her
orderly
fashion
and
read
straight
through
to
the
last
it
took
one
hour
half
of
that
time
she
was
not
reading
she
was
staring
straight
ahead
with
what
is
mistakenly
called
an
unseeing
look
but
which
actually
pierces
the
veil
of
years
and
beholds
things
far
far
beyond
the
vision
of
the
actual
eye
they
were
the
letters
of
a
commonplace
man
to
a
commonplace
woman
written
when
they
loved
each
other
and
so
they
were
touched
with
something
of
the
divine
they
must
have
been
else
how
could
they
have
sustained
this
woman
through
fifteen
years
of
drudgery
they
were
the
only
tangible
foundation
left
of
the
structure
of
dreams
she
had
built
about
this
man
all
the
rest
of
her
house
of
love
had
tumbled
about
her
ears
fifteen
years
before
but
with
these
few
remaining
bricks
she
had
erected
many
times
since
castles
and
towers
more
exquisite
and
lofty
and
soaring
than
the
original
humble
structure
had
ever
been
the
story
well
there
really
is
any
as
we
warned
you
rose
had
been
pretty
then
in
much
the
same
delicate
way
that
floss
was
pretty
now
they
were
to
have
been
married
rose
mother
fell
ill
floss
and
al
were
little
more
than
babies
the
marriage
was
put
off
the
illness
lasted
six
months
a
year
two
years
became
interminable
the
breach
into
which
rose
had
stepped
closed
about
her
and
became
a
prison
the
man
had
waited
had
grown
impatient
finally
rebelled
he
had
fled
probably
to
marry
a
less
encumbered
lady
rose
had
gone
dully
on
caring
for
the
household
the
children
the
sick
woman
in
the
years
that
had
gone
by
since
then
rose
had
forgiven
him
his
faithlessness
she
only
remembered
that
he
had
been
wont
to
call
her
his
r√∂schen
his
rosebud
his
pretty
flower
being
a
german
gentleman
she
only
recalled
the
wonder
of
having
been
first
in
some
one
thoughts
she
who
now
was
so
hopelessly
so
irrevocably
last
as
she
sat
there
in
her
kitchen
wearing
her
and
faded
blue
gingham
and
the
pushed
back
at
a
rakish
angle
a
simpering
little
smile
about
her
lips
she
was
really
very
much
like
the
disappointed
old
maids
you
used
to
see
so
cruelly
pictured
in
the
comic
valentines
had
those
letters
obsessed
her
a
little
more
strongly
she
might
have
become
quite
mad
the
freudians
would
tell
you
had
they
held
less
for
her
or
had
she
not
been
so
completely
the
household
slave
she
might
have
found
a
certain
solace
and
satisfaction
in
viewing
the
greek
profile
and
marcel
wave
of
the
movie
star
as
it
was
they
were
her
ballast
her
refuge
the
leavening
yeast
in
the
soggy
dough
of
her
existence
this
man
had
wanted
her
to
be
his
wife
she
had
found
favour
in
his
eyes
she
was
certain
that
he
still
thought
of
her
sometimes
and
tenderly
regretfully
as
she
thought
of
him
it
helped
her
to
live
not
only
that
it
made
living
possible
a
clock
struck
a
window
slammed
or
a
smote
her
ear
sharply
some
sound
started
her
out
of
her
reverie
rose
jumped
stared
a
moment
at
the
letters
in
her
lap
then
hastily
almost
shamefacedly
sorted
them
she
knew
each
envelope
by
heart
tied
them
placed
them
in
their
box
and
bore
them
down
the
hail
there
mounting
her
chair
she
scrubbed
the
top
shelf
with
her
soapy
rag
placed
the
box
in
its
corner
left
the
hall
closet
smelling
of
cleanliness
with
never
a
hint
of
lavender
to
betray
its
secret
treasure
were
rose
to
die
and
go
to
heaven
there
to
spend
her
days
thumbing
a
golden
harp
her
hands
by
force
of
habit
would
drop
at
quarter
to
six
to
begin
laying
a
celestial
and
unspotted
for
supper
habits
as
deeply
rooted
as
that
must
hold
even
in
stampede
was
noticeably
subdued
on
the
part
of
pa
and
al
it
had
been
a
day
of
sudden
and
enervating
heat
and
the
city
had
done
its
worst
to
them
pa
pink
gills
showed
a
hint
of
purple
al
flimsy
silk
shirt
stuck
to
his
back
and
his
glittering
pompadour
was
many
degrees
less
submissive
than
was
its
wont
but
floss
came
in
late
breathless
and
radiant
a
large
and
significant
paper
bag
in
her
hand
rose
in
the
kitchen
was
transferring
the
smoking
supper
from
pot
to
platter
pa
in
the
doorway
of
the
sick
woman
little
room
had
just
put
his
question
with
his
usual
assumption
of
heartiness
and
cheer
well
well
and
how
the
old
girl
feel
like
you
could
get
up
and
punish
a
little
supper
eh
al
engaged
at
the
telephone
with
some
one
whom
he
addressed
proprietorially
as
kid
was
deep
in
his
plans
for
the
evening
diversion
upon
this
accustomed
scene
floss
burst
with
havoc
rose
rose
did
you
iron
my
georgette
cr√™pe
listen
guess
what
all
this
as
she
was
rushing
down
the
hall
paper
still
in
hand
guess
who
was
in
the
store
rose
at
the
oven
turned
a
flushed
and
interested
face
toward
floss
who
what
that
a
hat
yes
but
listen
let
see
it
floss
whipped
it
out
of
its
bag
defiantly
there
but
wait
a
minute
let
me
tell
you
how
much
floss
hesitated
just
a
second
her
wage
was
nine
dollars
a
week
then
trimmed
the
hat
was
one
of
those
tiny
absurdities
that
only
the
flosses
can
wear
trimmed
is
right
jeered
al
from
the
doorway
rose
with
disapproval
turned
to
her
stove
again
well
but
i
had
to
have
it
i
going
to
the
theatre
and
guess
who
with
henry
selz
henry
selz
was
the
unromantic
name
of
the
commonplace
man
over
whose
letters
rose
had
glowed
and
dreamed
an
hour
before
it
was
a
name
that
had
become
mythical
in
that
household
to
all
but
one
rose
heard
it
spoken
now
with
a
sense
of
unreality
she
smiled
a
little
uncertainly
and
went
on
stirring
the
flour
thickening
for
the
gravy
but
she
was
dimly
aware
that
something
inside
her
had
suspended
action
for
a
moment
during
which
moment
she
felt
strangely
light
and
disembodied
and
that
directly
afterward
the
thing
began
to
work
madly
so
that
there
was
a
choked
feeling
in
her
chest
and
a
hot
pounding
in
her
head
what
the
joke
she
said
stirring
the
gravy
in
the
pan
joke
nothing
honest
to
god
i
was
standing
back
of
the
counter
at
about
ten
the
rush
had
really
begun
yet
glove
trade
usually
starts
late
i
was
standing
there
kidding
herb
the
stock
boy
when
down
the
aisle
comes
a
man
in
a
big
hat
like
you
see
in
the
western
pictures
hair
a
little
grey
at
the
temples
and
everything
just
like
a
movie
actor
i
said
to
herb
it
real
i
had
got
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
when
the
fellow
sees
me
stands
stock
still
in
the
middle
of
the
aisle
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
eyes
sticking
out
surprise
i
said
to
herb
and
looked
around
for
the
camera
and
that
minute
he
took
two
jumps
over
to
where
i
was
standing
grabbed
my
hands
and
says
rose
kind
of
choky
by
about
twenty
years
i
said
floss
rose
sister
let
go
my
hands
rose
a
transfigured
rose
glowing
trembling
radiant
repeated
vibrantly
you
said
floss
rose
sister
let
go
my
hands
and
he
looked
kind
of
stunned
for
just
a
minute
his
face
was
a
scream
honestly
then
he
said
of
course
fifteen
years
but
i
had
always
thought
of
her
as
just
the
same
and
he
kind
of
laughed
ashamed
like
a
kid
and
the
whitest
teeth
yes
they
were
white
said
rose
well
well
i
said
i
do
instead
bet
you
do
he
said
and
then
he
told
me
his
name
and
how
he
was
living
out
in
spokane
and
his
wife
was
dead
and
he
had
made
a
lot
of
money
fruit
or
real
estate
or
something
he
talked
a
lot
about
it
at
lunch
but
i
did
pay
any
attention
as
long
as
he
really
has
it
a
lot
i
care
how
at
lunch
everything
from
to
coffee
i
did
know
it
could
be
done
in
one
hour
believe
me
he
had
those
waiters
jumping
it
takes
money
he
asked
all
about
you
and
ma
and
everything
and
he
kept
looking
at
me
and
saying
wonderful
i
said
it
but
i
meant
the
lunch
he
wanted
me
to
go
driving
this
afternoon
auto
and
everything
kept
calling
me
rose
it
made
me
kind
of
mad
and
i
told
him
how
you
look
he
said
suppose
so
and
asked
me
to
go
to
a
show
listen
did
you
press
my
georgette
and
the
blue
i
iron
the
waist
while
you
eating
i
not
hungry
it
only
takes
a
minute
did
you
say
he
was
grey
grey
oh
you
mean
why
just
here
and
here
interesting
but
not
a
bit
old
and
he
got
that
money
look
that
makes
waiters
and
doormen
and
taxi
drivers
just
hump
i
do
want
any
supper
just
a
cup
of
tea
i
have
got
enough
time
to
dress
in
decently
as
it
is
al
draped
in
the
doorway
removed
his
cigarette
to
give
greater
force
to
his
speech
your
story
interests
me
strangely
little
gell
but
there
a
couple
of
other
people
that
would
like
to
eat
even
if
you
would
come
on
with
that
supper
ro
nobody
staked
me
to
a
lunch
rose
turned
to
her
stove
again
two
carmine
spots
had
leaped
suddenly
to
her
cheeks
she
served
the
meal
in
silence
and
ate
nothing
but
that
was
not
remarkable
for
the
cook
there
is
little
appeal
in
the
meat
that
she
has
tended
from
its
moist
and
bloody
entrance
in
the
paper
through
the
basting
or
broiling
stage
to
its
formal
appearance
on
the
platter
she
saw
that
al
and
her
father
were
served
then
she
went
back
to
the
kitchen
and
the
thud
of
her
iron
was
heard
as
she
deftly
fluted
the
ruffles
of
the
cr√™pe
blouse
floss
appeared
when
the
meal
was
half
eaten
her
hair
shiningly
coiffed
the
pink
ribbons
of
her
corset
cover
showing
under
her
thin
kimono
she
poured
herself
a
cup
of
tea
and
drank
it
in
little
quick
nervous
gulps
she
looked
deliriously
young
and
fragile
and
appealing
her
delicate
slenderness
revealed
by
the
flimsy
garment
she
wore
excitement
and
anticipation
lent
a
glow
to
her
eyes
colour
to
her
cheeks
al
glancing
expertly
at
the
ingenuousness
of
her
artfully
simple
coiffure
the
slim
limpness
of
her
body
her
gaze
laughed
a
wise
little
laugh
every
move
a
pickford
and
so
girlish
withal
floss
ignored
him
hurry
up
with
that
waist
rose
i
on
the
collar
now
in
a
second
there
was
a
little
silence
then
floss
is
is
henry
going
to
call
for
you
here
well
sure
did
you
think
i
was
going
to
meet
him
on
the
corner
he
said
he
wanted
to
see
you
or
something
polite
like
that
she
finished
her
tea
and
vanished
again
al
too
had
disappeared
to
begin
that
process
from
which
he
had
always
emerged
incredibly
sleek
and
dapper
and
perfumed
his
progress
with
shaving
brush
shirt
collar
and
tie
was
marked
by
disjointed
bars
of
the
newest
syncopation
whistled
with
an
uncanny
precision
and
fidelity
to
detail
he
caught
the
broken
time
and
tossed
it
lightly
up
again
and
dropped
it
and
caught
it
deftly
like
a
juggler
playing
with
frail
crystal
globes
that
seem
forever
on
the
point
of
crashing
to
the
ground
pa
stood
up
yawning
well
he
said
his
manner
very
casual
guess
i
just
drop
around
to
the
movie
from
the
kitchen
do
you
want
to
sit
with
ma
a
minute
first
i
will
when
i
come
back
they
showing
the
third
installment
of
adventures
of
aline
and
i
do
want
to
come
in
in
the
middle
of
it
he
knew
the
selfishness
of
it
this
furtive
and
sprightly
old
man
and
because
he
knew
it
he
attempted
to
hide
his
guilt
under
a
burst
of
temper
i
been
slaving
all
day
i
guess
i
got
the
right
to
a
little
amusement
a
man
works
his
fingers
to
the
bone
for
his
family
and
then
his
own
daughter
nags
him
he
stamped
down
the
hall
righteously
and
slammed
the
front
door
rose
came
from
the
kitchen
the
pink
blouse
warm
from
the
iron
in
one
hand
she
prinked
out
its
ruffles
and
pleatings
as
she
went
floss
burnishing
her
nails
somewhat
frantically
with
a
dilapidated
and
greasy
buffer
snatched
the
garment
from
her
and
slipped
bare
arms
into
it
the
front
door
bell
rang
three
big
determined
rings
panic
fell
upon
the
household
it
him
whispered
floss
as
if
she
could
be
heard
in
the
entrance
three
floors
below
you
have
to
go
i
ca
every
inch
of
her
seemed
to
shrink
and
cower
away
from
the
thought
i
ca
her
eyes
darted
to
and
fro
like
a
hunted
thing
seeking
to
escape
she
ran
to
the
hall
al
al
go
to
the
door
will
you
ca
came
back
in
a
thick
mumble
shaving
the
front
rang
again
three
big
determined
rings
rose
hissed
floss
her
tone
venomous
i
ca
go
with
my
waist
open
for
heaven
sake
go
to
the
door
i
ca
repeated
rose
in
a
kind
of
wail
i
ca
and
went
as
she
went
she
passed
one
futile
hand
over
her
hair
plucked
off
her
apron
and
tossed
it
into
a
corner
first
wiping
her
flushed
face
with
it
henry
selz
came
up
the
shabby
stairs
springily
as
a
man
of
forty
should
rose
stood
at
the
door
and
waited
for
him
he
stood
in
the
doorway
a
moment
uncertainly
henry
his
uncertainty
became
incredulity
then
why
rose
know
you
for
a
minute
well
well
it
been
a
long
time
see
ten
fourteen
about
fifteen
years
is
it
his
tone
was
cheerfully
conversational
he
really
was
interested
mathematically
he
was
as
sentimental
in
his
reminiscence
as
if
he
had
been
calculating
the
lapse
of
time
between
the
chicago
fire
and
the
world
fair
fifteen
said
rose
in
may
wo
you
come
in
floss
be
here
in
a
minute
henry
selz
came
in
and
sat
down
on
the
davenport
couch
and
dabbed
at
his
forehead
the
years
had
been
very
kind
to
him
those
same
years
that
had
treated
rose
so
ruthlessly
he
had
the
look
of
an
outdoor
man
a
man
who
has
met
prosperity
and
walked
with
her
and
followed
her
pleasant
ways
a
man
who
has
learned
late
in
life
of
golf
and
caviar
and
tailors
but
who
has
adapted
himself
to
these
accessories
of
wealth
with
a
minimum
of
friction
it
certainly
is
warm
for
this
time
of
year
he
leaned
back
and
regarded
rose
tolerantly
well
and
how
you
been
did
little
sister
tell
you
how
flabbergasted
i
was
when
i
saw
her
this
morning
i
darned
if
it
did
take
fifteen
years
off
my
age
just
like
that
i
got
kind
of
balled
up
for
one
minute
and
thought
it
was
you
she
tell
you
yes
she
told
me
said
rose
i
hear
your
ma
still
sick
that
certainly
is
tough
and
you
never
married
eh
never
married
echoed
rose
and
so
they
made
conversation
a
little
uncomfortably
until
there
came
quick
light
young
steps
down
the
hallway
and
floss
appeared
in
the
door
a
radiant
glowing
girlish
vision
youth
was
in
her
eyes
her
cheeks
on
her
lips
she
radiated
it
she
was
miraculously
well
dressed
in
her
knowingly
simple
blue
serge
suit
and
her
tiny
hat
and
her
neat
shoes
and
gloves
ah
and
how
the
little
girl
said
henry
selz
floss
dimpled
blushed
smiled
swayed
did
i
keep
you
waiting
a
terribly
long
time
no
not
a
bit
rose
and
i
were
chinning
over
old
times
were
we
rose
a
kindly
clumsy
thought
struck
him
say
look
here
rose
going
to
a
show
why
do
you
run
and
put
on
your
hat
and
come
along

on
rose
smiled
as
a
mother
smiles
at
a
child
that
has
unknowingly
hurt
her
no

floss
run
along
yes
remember
you
to
ma
i
sorry
you
ca

her
but
she
do
see
anybody
poor
ma
then
they
were
off
in
a
little
flurry
of
words
and
laughter
from
force
of
habit
rose
eyes
peered
critically
at
the
hang
of
floss
blue
skirt
and
the
angle
of
the
pert
new
hat
she
stood
a
moment
uncertainly
after
they
had
left
on
her
face
was
the
queerest
look
as
of
one
thinking
struggling
to
arrive
at
a
conclusion
in
the
midst
of
sudden
bewilderment
she
turned
mechanically
and
went
into
her
mother
room
she
picked
up
the
tray
on
the
table
by
the
bed
who
was
that
asked
the
sick
woman
in
her
ghostly
devitalised
voice
that
was
henry
selz
said
rose
the
sick
woman
grappled
a
moment
with
memory
henry
selz
henry
oh
yes
did
he
go
out
with
rose
yes
said
rose
it
cold
in
here
whined
the
sick
woman
i
get
you
a
hot
bag
in
a
minute
ma
rose
carried
the
tray
down
the
hall
to
the
kitchen
at
that
al
emerged
from
his
bedroom
shrugging
himself
into
his
coat
he
followed
rose
down
the
hall
and
watched
her
as
she
filled
the
bag
and
screwed
it
and
wiped
it
dry
i
take
that
in
to
ma
he
volunteered
he
was
up
the
hall
and
back
in
a
flash
rose
had
slumped
into
a
chair
at
the
table
and
was
pouring
herself
a
cup
of
cold
and
bitter
tea
al
came
over
to
her
and
laid
one
white
hand
on
her
shoulder
ro
lend
me
a
couple
of
dollars
till
saturday
will
you
i
should
say
not
al
doused
his
cigarette
in
the
dregs
of
a
convenient
teacup
he
bent
down
and
laid
his
powdered
and
pale
cheek
against
rose
sallow
one
one
arm
was
about
her
and
his
hand
patted
her
shoulder
oh
come
on
kid
he
coaxed
do
i
always
pay
you
back
come
on
be
a
sweet
ol
sis
i
would
ask
you
only
i
got
a
date
to
go
to
the
white
city
and
dance
and
i
could
get
out
of
it
i
tried
he
kissed
her
and
his
lips
were
moist
and
he
reeked
of
tobacco
and
though
rose
shrugged
impatiently
away
from
him
he
knew
that
he
had
won
rose
was
not
an
eloquent
woman
she
was
not
even
an
articulate
one
at
times
if
she
had
been
she
would
have
lifted
up
her
voice
to
say
now
oh
god
i
am
a
woman
why
have
you
given
me
all
the
sorrows
and
the
drudgery
and
the
bitterness
and
the
thanklessness
of
motherhood
with
none
of
its
joys
give
me
back
my
youth
i
drink
the
dregs
at
the
bottom
of
the
cup
but
first
let
me
taste
the
sweet
but
rose
did
not
talk
or
think
in
such
terms
she
could
not
have
put
into
words
the
thing
she
was
feeling
even
if
she
had
been
able
to
diagnose
it
so
what
she
said
was
do
you
think
i
ever
get
sick
and
tired
of
slaving
for
a
thankless
bunch
like
you
well
i
do
sick
and
tired
of
it
that
what
you
make
me
tired
coming
around
asking
for
money
as
if
i
was
a
bank
but
al
waited
and
presently
she
said
grudgingly
wearily
there
a
dollar
bill
and
some
small
change
in
the
can
on
the
second
shelf
in
the
china
closet
al
was
off
like
a
terrier
from
the
pantry
came
the
clink
of
metal
against
metal
he
was
up
the
hall
in
a
flash
without
a
look
at
rose
the
front
door
slammed
a
third
time
rose
stirred
her
cold
tea
slowly
leaning
on
the
table
edge
and
gazing
down
into
the
amber
liquid
that
she
did
not
mean
to
drink
for
suddenly
and
comically
her
face
puckered
up
like
a
child
her
head
came
down
among
the
supper
things
with
a
little
crash
that
set
the
teacups
and
the
greasy
plates
to
jingling
and
she
sobbed
as
she
lay
there
with
great
tearing
ugly
sobs
that
would
not
be
stilled
though
she
tried
to
stifle
them
as
does
one
who
lives
in
a
chicago
flat
she
was
not
weeping
for
the
henry
selz
whom
she
had
just
seen
she
was
not
weeping
for
envy
of
her
selfish
little
sister
or
for
loneliness
or
weariness
she
was
weeping
at
the
loss
of
a
ghost
who
had
become
her
familiar
she
was
weeping
because
a
packet
of
soiled
and
yellow
old
letters
on
the
top
shelf
in
the
hall
closet
was
now
only
a
packet
of
soiled
and
yellow
old
letters
food
for
the
ash
can
she
was
weeping
because
the
urge
of
spring
that
had
expressed
itself
in
her
only
this
morning
pitifully
enough
in
terms
of
rhubarb
and
housecleaning
and
a
bundle
of
thumbed
old
love
letters
had
stirred
in
her
for
the
last
time
but
presently
she
did
stop
her
sobbing
and
got
up
and
cleared
the
table
and
washed
the
dishes
and
even
glanced
at
the
crumpled
sheets
of
the
morning
paper
that
she
never
found
time
to
read
until
evening
by
eight
the
little
flat
was
very
still
v
that
marriage
theresa
platt
she
that
had
been
terry
sheehan
watched
her
husband
across
the
breakfast
table
with
eyes
that
smouldered
when
a
eyes
smoulder
at
the
person
seated
opposite
her
had
better
look
out
but
orville
platt
was
quite
unaware
of
any
smouldering
in
progress
he
was
occupied
with
his
eggs
how
could
he
know
that
these
very
eggs
were
feeding
the
dull
red
menace
in
terry
platt
eyes
when
orville
platt
ate
a
egg
he
concentrated
on
it
he
treated
it
as
a
great
adventure
which
after
all
it
is
few
adjuncts
of
our
daily
life
contain
the
element
of
chance
that
is
to
be
found
in
a
breakfast
egg
this
was
orville
platt
method
of
attack
first
he
chipped
off
the
top
neatly
then
he
bent
forward
and
subjected
it
to
a
passionate
and
relentless
scrutiny
straightening
preparatory
to
plunging
his
spoon
therein
he
flapped
his
right
elbow
it
was
exactly
a
flap
it
was
a
pass
between
a
hitch
and
a
flap
and
presented
external
evidence
of
a
mental
state
orville
platt
always
gave
that
little
preliminary
jerk
when
he
was
contemplating
a
step
or
when
he
was
moved
or
argumentative
it
was
a
trick
as
innocent
as
it
was
maddening
terry
platt
had
learned
to
look
for
that
flap
they
had
been
married
four
years
to
look
for
it
and
to
hate
it
with
a
morbid
unreasoning
hate
that
flap
of
the
elbow
was
tearing
terry
platt
nerves
into
raw
bleeding
fragments
her
fingers
were
clenched
tightly
under
the
table
now
she
was
breathing
unevenly
if
he
does
that
again
she
told
herself
if
he
flaps
again
when
he
opens
the
second
egg
i
scream
i
scream
scream
i
sc
he
had
scooped
the
first
egg
into
his
cup
now
he
picked
up
the
second
chipped
it
concentrated
straightened
then
up
went
the
elbow
and
down
with
the
accustomed
little
flap
the
tortured
nerves
snapped
through
the
early
morning
quiet
of
wetona
wisconsin
hurtled
the
shrill
piercing
shriek
of
terry
hysteria
terry
for
god
sake
what
the
matter
orville
platt
dropped
the
second
egg
and
his
spoon
the
egg
yolk
trickled
down
his
plate
the
spoon
made
a
clatter
and
flung
a
gay
spot
of
yellow
on
the
cloth
he
started
toward
her
terry
pointed
a
shaking
finger
at
him
she
was
laughing
now
uncontrollably
your
elbow
your
elbow
elbow
he
looked
down
at
it
bewildered
then
up
fright
in
his
face
what
the
matter
with
it
she
mopped
her
eyes
sobs
shook
her
you
it
the
bewilderment
in
orville
platt
face
gave
way
to
anger
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
screeched
like
that
because
my
because
i
moved
my
elbow
yes
his
anger
deepened
and
reddened
to
fury
he
choked
he
had
started
from
his
chair
with
his
napkin
in
his
hand
he
still
clutched
it
now
he
crumpled
it
into
a
wad
and
hurled
it
to
the
centre
of
the
table
where
it
struck
a
sugar
bowl
dropped
back
and
uncrumpled
slowly
reprovingly
you
you
then
bewilderment
closed
down
again
like
a
fog
over
his
countenance
but
why
i
ca
see
because
it
because
i
ca
stand
it
any
longer
flapping
this
is
what
you
do
like
this
and
she
did
it
did
it
with
insulting
fidelity
being
a
clever
mimic
well
all
i
can
say
is
you
crazy
yelling
like
that
for
nothing
it
is
nothing
is
huh
if
that
is
nothing
what
is
they
were
growing
incoherent
what
mean
screeching
like
a
maniac
like
a
wild
woman
the
neighbours
think
i
killed
you
what
mean
anyway
i
mean
i
tired
of
watching
it
that
what
sick
and
tired
huh
well
young
lady
just
let
me
tell
something
he
told
her
there
followed
one
of
those
incredible
quarrels
as
sickening
as
they
are
human
which
can
take
place
only
between
two
people
who
love
each
other
who
love
each
other
so
well
that
each
knows
with
cruel
certainty
the
surest
way
to
wound
the
other
and
who
stab
and
tear
and
claw
at
these
vulnerable
spots
in
exact
proportion
to
their
love
ugly
words
bitter
words
words
that
neither
knew
they
knew
flew
between
them
like
sparks
between
steel
striking
steel
from
him
trouble
with
you
is
you
have
got
enough
to
do
that
the
trouble
with
half
you
women
just
lay
around
the
house
rotting
i
a
fool
slaving
on
the
road
to
keep
a
i
suppose
you
call
sitting
around
hotel
lobbies
slaving
i
suppose
the
house
runs
itself
how
about
my
evenings
sitting
here
alone
night
after
night
when
you
on
the
road
finally
well
if
you
do
like
it
he
snarled
and
lifted
his
chair
by
the
back
and
slammed
it
down
savagely
if
you
do
like
it
why
do
you
get
out
h
why
do
you
get
out
and
from
her
her
eyes
narrowed
to
two
slits
her
cheeks
scarlet
why
thanks
i
guess
i
will
ten
minutes
later
he
had
flung
out
of
the
house
to
catch
the
for
manitowoc
he
marched
down
the
street
his
shoulders
swinging
rhythmically
to
the
weight
of
the
burden
he
carried
his
black
leather
and
the
shiny
tan
sample
case
both
from
many
encounters
with
ruthless
porters
and
men
and
bell
boys
for
four
years
as
he
left
for
his
trip
he
and
terry
had
observed
a
certain
little
ceremony
as
had
the
neighbours
she
would
stand
in
the
doorway
watching
him
down
the
street
the
heavier
banging
occasionally
at
his
shin
the
depot
was
only
three
blocks
away
terry
watched
him
with
fond
but
unillusioned
eyes
which
proves
that
she
really
loved
him
he
was
a
dapper
fat
man
with
a
weakness
for
pronounced
patterns
in
suitings
and
addicted
to
brown
derbies
one
week
on
the
road
one
week
at
home
that
was
his
routine
the
wholesale
grocery
trade
liked
platt
and
he
had
for
his
customers
the
fondness
that
a
travelling
salesman
has
who
is
successful
in
his
territory
before
his
marriage
to
terry
sheehan
his
little
red
address
book
had
been
overwhelming
proof
against
the
theory
that
nobody
loves
a
fat
man
terry
standing
in
the
doorway
always
knew
that
when
he
reached
the
corner
just
where
schroeder
house
threatened
to
hide
him
from
view
he
would
stop
drop
the
sample
case
wave
his
hand
just
once
pick
up
the
sample
case
and
go
on
proceeding
backward
for
a
step
or
two
until
schroeder
house
made
good
its
threat
it
was
a
comic
scene
in
the
eyes
of
the
onlooker
perhaps
because
a
chubby
romeo
offends
the
sense
of
fitness
the
neighbours
lurking
behind
their
parlour
curtains
had
laughed
at
first
but
after
awhile
they
learned
to
look
for
that
little
scene
and
to
take
it
unto
themselves
as
if
it
were
a
personal
thing
wives
whose
husbands
had
long
since
abandoned
flowery
farewells
used
to
get
a
vicarious
thrill
out
of
it
and
to
eye
terry
with
a
sort
of
envy
this
morning
orville
platt
did
not
even
falter
when
he
reached
schroeder
corner
he
marched
straight
on
looking
steadily
ahead
the
heavy
bags
swinging
from
either
hand
even
if
he
had
stopped
though
she
knew
he
would
terry
platt
would
not
have
seen
him
she
remained
seated
at
the
disordered
breakfast
table
a
dreadfully
still
figure
and
sinister
a
figure
of
stone
and
fire
of
ice
and
flame
over
and
over
in
her
mind
she
was
milling
the
things
she
might
have
said
to
him
and
had
not
she
brewed
a
hundred
vitriolic
cruelties
that
she
might
have
flung
in
his
face
she
would
concoct
one
biting
brutality
and
dismiss
it
for
a
second
and
abandon
that
for
a
third
she
was
too
angry
to
cry
a
dangerous
state
in
a
woman
she
was
what
is
known
as
cold
mad
so
that
her
mind
was
working
clearly
and
with
amazing
swiftness
and
yet
as
though
it
were
a
thing
detached
a
thing
that
was
no
part
of
her
she
sat
thus
for
the
better
part
of
an
hour
motionless
except
for
one
forefinger
that
was
quite
unconsciously
tapping
out
a
popular
and
cheap
little
air
that
she
had
been
strumming
at
the
piano
the
evening
before
having
bought
it
down
town
that
same
afternoon
it
had
struck
orville
fancy
and
she
had
played
it
over
and
over
for
him
her
right
forefinger
was
playing
the
entire
tune
and
something
in
the
back
of
her
head
was
following
it
accurately
though
the
separate
thinking
process
was
going
on
just
the
same
her
eyes
were
bright
and
wide
and
hot
suddenly
she
became
conscious
of
the
musical
antics
of
her
finger
she
folded
it
in
with
its
mates
so
that
her
hand
became
a
fist
she
stood
up
and
stared
down
at
the
clutter
of
the
breakfast
table
the
egg
that
fateful
second
egg
had
congealed
to
a
mottled
mess
of
yellow
and
white
the
spoon
lay
on
the
cloth
his
coffee
only
half
consumed
showed
tan
with
a
cold
grey
film
over
it
a
slice
of
toast
at
the
left
of
his
plate
seemed
to
grin
at
her
with
the
wedge
that
he
had
bitten
out
of
it
terry
stared
down
at
this
congealing
remnant
then
she
laughed
a
hard
high
little
laugh
pushed
a
plate
away
contemptuously
with
her
hand
and
walked
into
the
sitting
room
on
the
piano
was
the
piece
of
music
bennie
gottschalk
great
song
hit
hicky
bloo
which
she
had
been
playing
the
night
before
she
picked
it
up
tore
it
straight
across
once
placed
the
pieces
back
to
back
and
tore
it
across
again
then
she
dropped
the
pieces
to
the
floor
you
bet
i
going
she
said
as
though
concluding
a
train
of
thought
you
just
bet
i
going
right
now
and
terry
went
she
went
for
much
the
same
reason
as
that
given
by
the
ladye
of
high
degree
in
the
old
english
song
she
who
had
left
her
lord
and
bed
and
board
to
go
with
the
the
thing
that
was
sending
terry
platt
away
was
much
more
than
a
conjugal
quarrel
precipitated
by
a
egg
and
a
flap
of
the
arm
it
went
so
much
deeper
that
if
psychology
had
not
become
a
cant
word
we
might
drag
it
into
the
explanation
it
went
so
deep
that
it
necessary
to
delve
back
to
the
days
when
theresa
platt
was
terry
sheehan
to
get
the
real
significance
of
it
and
of
the
things
she
did
after
she
went
when
orville
platt
had
been
terry
sheehan
she
had
played
the
piano
afternoons
and
evenings
in
the
orchestra
of
the
bijou
theatre
on
cass
street
wetona
wisconsin
any
one
with
a
name
like
terry
sheehan
would
perforce
do
well
anything
she
might
set
out
to
do
there
was
nothing
of
genius
in
terry
but
there
was
something
of
fire
and
much
that
was
irish
the
combination
makes
for
what
is
known
as
imagination
in
playing
which
meant
that
the
watson
team
eccentric
song
and
dance
artists
never
needed
a
rehearsal
when
they
played
the
bijou
ruby
watson
used
merely
to
approach
terry
before
the
monday
performance
in
hand
and
say
listen
dearie
we
got
some
new
business
i
want
to
wise
you
to
right
here
it
goes
dum
see
like
that
and
then
jim
vamps
get
me
terry
at
the
piano
would
pucker
her
pretty
brow
a
moment
then
like
this
you
mean
that
it
you
got
it
all
right
i
tell
the
drum
she
could
play
any
tune
by
ear
once
heard
she
got
the
spirit
of
a
thing
and
transmitted
it
when
terry
played
a
march
number
you
tapped
the
floor
with
your
foot
and
unconsciously
straightened
your
shoulders
when
she
played
a
song
that
was
heavy
on
the
minor
wail
you
hoped
that
the
man
next
to
you
did
know
you
were
crying
which
he
probably
did
because
he
was
weeping
too
at
that
time
motion
pictures
had
not
attained
their
present
virulence
vaudeville
polite
or
otherwise
had
not
yet
been
crowded
out
by
the
ubiquitous
film
the
bijou
offered
entertainment
of
the
tramp
variety
interspersed
with
trick
bicyclists
soubrettes
in
slightly
soiled
pink
trained
seals
and
family
fours
with
lumpy
legs
who
tossed
each
other
about
and
struck
goldbergian
attitudes
contact
with
these
gave
terry
sheehan
a
tone
the
more
conservative
of
her
townspeople
looked
at
her
askance
there
never
had
been
an
evil
thing
about
terry
but
wetona
considered
her
rather
fly
terry
hair
was
very
black
and
she
had
a
fondness
for
those
little
scarlet
velvet
turbans
a
scarlet
velvet
turban
would
have
made
martha
washington
look
fly
terry
mother
had
died
when
the
girl
was
eight
and
terry
father
had
been
what
is
known
as
a
lovable
shiftless
chap
in
the
contracting
business
he
drove
around
wetona
in
a
sagging
cart
and
never
made
any
money
because
he
did
honest
work
and
charged
as
little
for
it
as
men
who
did
not
his
mortar
stuck
and
his
bricks
did
not
crumble
and
his
lumber
did
not
crack
riches
are
not
acquired
in
the
contracting
business
in
that
way
ed
sheehan
and
his
daughter
were
great
friends
when
he
died
she
was
nineteen
they
say
she
screamed
once
like
a
banshee
and
dropped
to
the
floor
after
they
had
straightened
out
the
muddle
of
books
in
ed
gritty
dusty
little
office
terry
turned
her
talent
to
practical
account
at
she
was
still
playing
at
the
bijou
and
into
her
face
was
creeping
the
first
hint
of
that
look
of
sophistication
which
comes
from
daily
contact
with
the
artificial
world
of
the
footlights
it
is
the
look
of
those
who
must
make
believe
as
a
business
and
are
you
see
it
developed
into
its
highest
degree
in
the
face
of
a
veteran
comedian
it
is
the
thing
that
gives
the
look
of
utter
pathos
and
tragedy
to
the
relaxed
expression
of
a
circus
clown
there
are
in
a
small
town
like
wetona
just
two
kinds
of
girls
those
who
go
down
town
saturday
nights
and
those
who
do
terry
if
she
had
not
been
busy
with
her
job
at
the
bijou
would
have
come
in
the
first
group
she
craved
excitement
there
was
little
chance
to
satisfy
such
craving
in
wetona
but
she
managed
to
find
certain
means
the
travelling
men
from
the
burke
house
just
across
the
street
used
to
drop
in
at
the
bijou
for
an
evening
entertainment
they
usually
sat
well
toward
the
front
and
terry
expert
playing
and
the
gloss
of
her
black
hair
and
her
piquant
profile
as
she
sometimes
looked
up
toward
the
stage
for
a
signal
from
one
of
the
performers
caught
their
fancy
and
held
it
terry
did
not
accept
their
attentions
promiscuously
she
was
too
decent
a
girl
for
that
but
she
found
herself
at
the
end
of
a
year
or
two
with
a
rather
large
acquaintance
among
these
peripatetic
gentlemen
you
occasionally
saw
one
of
them
strolling
home
with
her
sometimes
she
went
driving
with
one
of
them
of
a
sunday
afternoon
and
she
rather
enjoyed
taking
sunday
dinner
at
the
burke
hotel
with
a
favoured
friend
she
thought
those
hotel
sunday
dinners
the
last
word
in
elegance
the
roast
course
was
always
accompanied
by
an
aqueous
concoction
which
the
bill
of
fare
revealed
as
roman
punch
it
added
a
royal
touch
to
the
repast
even
when
served
with
roast
pork
i
do
say
that
any
of
these
lotharios
snatched
a
kiss
during
a
sunday
afternoon
drive
or
that
terry
slapped
him
promptly
but
either
seems
extremely
likely
terry
was
when
orville
platt
making
his
initial
wisconsin
trip
for
the
wholesale
grocery
house
he
represented
first
beheld
terry
piquant
irish
profile
and
heard
her
deft
manipulation
of
the
keys
orville
had
the
fat
man
sense
of
rhythm
and
love
of
music
he
had
a
buttery
tenor
voice
too
of
which
he
was
rather
proud
he
spent
three
days
in
wetona
that
first
trip
and
every
evening
saw
him
at
the
bijou
first
row
centre
he
stayed
through
two
shows
each
time
and
before
he
had
been
there
fifteen
minutes
terry
was
conscious
of
him
through
the
back
of
her
head
in
fact
i
think
that
in
all
innocence
she
rather
played
up
to
him
orville
platt
paid
no
more
heed
to
the
stage
and
what
was
occurring
thereon
than
if
it
had
not
been
he
sat
looking
at
terry
and
waggling
his
head
in
time
to
the
music
not
that
terry
was
a
beauty
but
she
was
one
of
those
immaculately
clean
types
that
look
of
fragrant
cleanliness
was
her
chief
charm
her
clear
smooth
skin
contributed
to
it
and
the
natural
pencilling
of
her
eyebrows
but
the
thing
that
accented
it
and
gave
it
a
last
touch
was
the
way
in
which
her
black
hair
came
down
in
a
little
point
just
in
the
centre
of
her
forehead
where
hair
meets
brow
it
grew
to
form
what
is
known
as
a
a
prettier
name
for
it
is
widow
peak
your
eye
lighted
on
it
pleased
and
from
it
travelled
its
gratified
way
down
her
white
temples
past
her
little
ears
to
the
smooth
black
coil
at
the
nape
of
her
neck
it
was
a
trip
that
rested
you
at
the
end
of
the
last
performance
on
the
second
night
of
his
visit
to
the
bijou
orville
waited
until
the
audience
had
begun
to
file
out
then
he
leaned
forward
over
the
rail
that
separated
orchestra
from
audience
could
you
he
said
his
tones
dulcet
could
you
oblige
me
with
the
name
of
that
last
piece
you
played
terry
was
stacking
her
music
george
she
called
to
the
drum
gentleman
wants
to
know
the
name
of
that
last
piece
and
prepared
to
leave
georgia
crackerjack
said
the
laconic
drum
orville
platt
took
a
hasty
in
the
direction
of
the
door
toward
which
terry
was
headed
it
a
pretty
thing
he
said
fervently
an
awful
pretty
thing
thanks
it
beautiful
terry
flung
a
last
insult
at
him
over
her
shoulder
do
thank
for
it
i
did
write
it
orville
platt
did
not
go
across
the
street
to
the
hotel
he
wandered
up
cass
street
and
into
the
quiet
of
main
street
and
down
as
far
as
the
park
and
back
pretty
as
a
pink
and
play
and
good
too
good
a
fat
man
in
love
at
the
end
of
six
months
they
were
married
terry
was
surprised
into
it
not
that
she
was
not
fond
of
him
she
was
and
grateful
to
him
as
well
for
pretty
as
she
was
no
man
had
ever
before
asked
terry
to
be
his
wife
they
had
made
love
to
her
they
had
paid
court
to
her
they
had
sent
her
large
boxes
of
stale
chocolates
and
called
her
endearing
names
as
they
made
cautious
declaration
such
as
i
known
a
lot
of
girls
but
you
got
something
different
i
know
you
got
so
much
sense
a
fellow
can
chum
around
with
you
little
pal
orville
headquarters
were
wetona
they
rented
a
comfortable
house
in
a
comfortable
neighbourhood
and
terry
dropped
the
red
velvet
turbans
and
went
in
for
picture
hats
and
paradise
aigrettes
orville
bought
her
a
piano
whose
tone
was
so
good
that
to
her
ear
accustomed
to
the
metallic
discords
of
the
bijou
instrument
it
sounded
out
of
tune
she
played
a
great
deal
at
first
but
unconsciously
she
missed
the
sharp
spat
of
applause
that
used
to
follow
her
public
performance
she
would
play
a
piece
brilliantly
and
then
her
hands
would
drop
to
her
lap
and
the
silence
of
her
own
sitting
room
would
fall
flat
on
her
ears
it
was
better
on
the
evenings
when
orville
was
home
he
sang
in
his
throaty
fat
man
tenor
to
terry
expert
accompaniment
this
is
better
than
playing
for
those
bum
actors
is
it
hon
and
he
would
pinch
her
ear
sure
listlessly
but
after
the
first
year
she
became
accustomed
to
what
she
termed
private
life
she
joined
an
afternoon
sewing
club
and
was
active
in
the
ladies
branch
of
the
she
developed
a
knack
at
cooking
too
and
orville
after
a
week
or
ten
days
of
hotel
fare
in
small
wisconsin
towns
would
come
home
to
biscuits
and
real
soup
and
honest
pies
and
cake
sometimes
in
the
midst
of
an
appetising
meal
he
would
lay
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
lean
back
in
his
chair
and
regard
the
cool
and
unruffled
terry
with
a
sort
of
reverence
in
his
eyes
then
he
would
get
up
and
come
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
and
tip
her
pretty
face
up
to
his
i
bet
i
wake
up
some
day
and
find
out
it
all
a
dream
you
know
this
kind
of
thing
does
really
happen
not
to
a
dub
like
me
one
year
two
three
four
routine
a
little
boredom
some
impatience
she
began
to
find
fault
with
the
very
things
she
had
liked
in
him
his
his
fondness
for
dashing
suit
patterns
his
throaty
tenor
his
worship
of
her
and
the
flap
oh
above
all
that
flap
that
little
innocent
meaningless
mannerism
that
made
her
tremble
with
nervousness
she
hated
it
so
that
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
speak
of
it
to
him
that
was
the
trouble
had
she
spoken
of
it
laughingly
or
in
earnest
before
it
became
an
obsession
with
her
that
hideous
breakfast
quarrel
with
its
taunts
and
revilings
and
open
hate
might
never
have
come
to
pass
for
that
matter
any
one
of
those
foreign
fellows
with
the
guttural
names
and
the
psychoanalytical
minds
could
have
located
her
trouble
in
one
terry
platt
herself
did
know
what
was
the
matter
with
her
she
would
have
denied
that
anything
was
wrong
she
did
even
throw
her
hands
above
her
head
and
shriek
i
want
to
live
i
want
to
live
i
want
to
live
like
a
lady
in
a
play
she
only
knew
she
was
sick
of
sewing
at
the
wetona
red
cross
shop
sick
of
marketing
of
home
comforts
of
orville
of
the
flap
orville
you
may
remember
left
at
the
bore
terry
chicagoward
she
had
left
the
house
as
it
was
beds
unmade
rooms
unswept
breakfast
table
uncleared
she
intended
never
to
come
back
now
and
then
a
picture
of
the
chaos
she
had
left
behind
would
flash
across
her
mind
the
spoon
on
the
pajamas
dangling
over
the
bathroom
chair
the
on
the
gas
stove
pooh
what
do
i
care
in
her
pocketbook
she
had
a
tidy
sum
saved
out
of
the
housekeeping
money
she
was
naturally
thrifty
and
orville
had
never
been
niggardly
her
meals
when
orville
was
on
the
road
had
been
those
sketchy
haphazard
affairs
with
which
women
content
themselves
when
their
household
is
manless
at
noon
she
went
into
the
dining
car
and
ordered
a
flaunting
little
repast
of
chicken
salad
and
asparagus
and
neapolitan
ice
cream
the
men
in
the
dining
car
eyed
her
speculatively
and
with
appreciation
then
their
glance
dropped
to
the
third
finger
of
her
left
hand
and
wandered
away
she
had
meant
to
remove
it
in
fact
she
had
taken
it
off
and
dropped
it
into
her
bag
but
her
hand
felt
so
queer
so
unaccustomed
so
naked
that
she
had
found
herself
slipping
the
narrow
band
on
again
and
her
thumb
groped
for
it
gratefully
it
was
almost
five
when
she
reached
chicago
she
felt
no
uncertainty
or
bewilderment
she
had
been
in
chicago
three
or
four
times
since
her
marriage
she
went
to
a
down
town
hotel
it
was
too
late
she
told
herself
to
look
for
a
more
inexpensive
room
that
night
when
she
had
tidied
herself
she
went
out
the
things
she
did
were
the
childish
aimless
things
that
one
does
who
finds
herself
in
possession
of
sudden
liberty
she
walked
up
state
street
and
stared
in
the
windows
came
back
turned
into
madison
passed
a
bright
little
shop
in
the
window
of
which
taffy
white
and
gold
was
being
wound
endlessly
and
fascinatingly
about
a
machine
she
went
in
and
bought
a
sackful
and
wandered
on
down
the
street
munching
she
had
supper
at
one
of
those
sarcophagi
that
emblazon
chicago
down
town
side
streets
it
had
been
her
original
intention
to
dine
in
state
in
the
dining
room
of
her
hotel
she
had
even
thought
daringly
of
lobster
but
at
the
last
moment
she
recoiled
from
the
idea
of
dining
alone
in
that
wilderness
of
tables
so
obviously
meant
for
two
after
her
supper
she
went
to
a
picture
show
she
was
amazed
to
find
there
instead
of
the
accustomed
orchestra
a
that
panted
and
throbbed
and
rumbled
over
lugubrious
classics
the
picture
was
about
a
faithless
wife
terry
left
in
the
middle
of
it
she
awoke
next
morning
at
seven
as
usual
started
up
wildly
looked
around
and
dropped
back
nothing
to
get
up
for
the
knowledge
did
not
fill
her
with
a
rush
of
relief
she
would
have
her
breakfast
in
bed
she
telephoned
for
it
languidly
but
when
it
came
she
got
up
and
ate
it
from
the
table
after
all
terry
was
the
kind
of
woman
to
whom
a
pink
gingham
apron
and
a
pink
are
ravishingly
becoming
at
seven
in
the
morning
that
sort
of
woman
congenitally
can
not
enjoy
her
breakfast
in
bed
that
morning
she
found
a
fairly
comfortable
room
more
within
her
means
on
the
north
side
in
the
boarding
house
district
she
unpacked
and
hung
up
her
clothes
and
drifted
down
town
again
idly
it
was
noon
when
she
came
to
the
corner
of
state
and
madison
streets
it
was
a
maelstrom
that
caught
her
up
and
buffeted
her
about
and
tossed
her
helplessly
this
way
and
that
the
corner
of
broadway
and
streets
has
been
exploited
in
song
and
story
as
the
world
most
hazardous
human
whirlpool
i
negotiated
that
corner
i
braved
the
square
in
front
of
the
american
express
company
office
in
paris
june
before
the
war
i
crossed
the
strand
at
when
the
theatre
crowds
are
just
out
and
to
my
mind
the
corner
of
state
and
madison
streets
between
twelve
and
one
makes
any
one
of
these
dizzy
spots
look
bosky
sylvan
and
deserted
the
thousands
jostled
terry
and
knocked
her
hat
awry
and
dug
her
with
unheeding
elbows
and
stepped
on
her
feet
say
look
here
she
said
once
futilely
they
did
not
stop
to
listen
state
and
madison
has
no
time
for
terrys
from
wetona
it
goes
its
way
pellmell
if
it
saw
terry
at
all
it
saw
her
only
as
a
prettyish
person
in
the
wrong
kind
of
suit
and
hat
with
a
bewildered
resentful
look
on
her
face
terry
drifted
on
down
the
west
side
of
state
street
with
the
hurrying
crowd
state
and
monroe
a
sound
came
to
terry
ears
a
sound
familiar
beloved
to
her
ear
harassed
with
the
roar
and
crash
with
the
shrill
scream
of
the
crossing
policemen
whistle
with
the
hiss
of
feet
shuffling
on
cement
it
was
a
celestial
strain
she
looked
up
toward
the
sound
a
great
window
opened
wide
to
the
street
in
it
a
girl
at
a
piano
and
a
man
singing
through
a
megaphone
and
on
a
flaring
red
and
green
sign
bernie
gottschalk
music
house
come
in
hear
bernie
gottschalk
latest
hit
the
song
that
has
got
all
the
song
that
made
the
kaiser
crawl
come
from
paris
illinois
but
oh
you
paris
france
i
used
to
wear
blue
overalls
but
now
its
khaki
come
in
come
in
terry
accepted
she
followed
the
sound
of
the
music
around
the
corner
up
a
little
flight
of
stairs
she
entered
the
realm
of
euterpe
euterpe
with
her
back
hair
frizzed
euterpe
with
her
flowing
white
robe
replaced
by
soiled
white
boots
that
failed
to
touch
the
hem
of
an
blue
serge
euterpe
abandoning
her
lyre
for
jazz
she
sat
at
the
piano
a
young
lady
whose
familiarity
with
the
piano
had
bred
contempt
nothing
else
could
have
accounted
for
her
treatment
of
it
her
fingers
tipped
with
grey
and
glistening
nails
clawed
the
keys
with
a
dreadful
mechanical
motion
there
were
stacks
of
on
counters
and
shelves
and
dangling
from
overhead
wires
the
girl
at
the
piano
never
ceased
playing
she
played
mostly
by
request
a
prospective
purchaser
would
mumble
something
in
the
ear
of
one
of
the
clerks
the
fat
man
with
the
megaphone
would
bawl
out
bloo
miss
ryan
and
miss
ryan
would
oblige
she
made
a
hideous
rattle
and
crash
and
clatter
of
sound
compared
to
which
an
indian
would
have
seemed
as
dulcet
as
the
strumming
of
a
lute
in
a
lady
boudoir
terry
joined
the
crowds
about
the
counter
the
girl
at
the
piano
was
not
looking
at
the
keys
her
head
was
screwed
around
over
her
left
shoulder
and
as
she
played
she
was
holding
forth
animatedly
to
a
girl
friend
who
had
evidently
dropped
in
from
some
store
or
office
during
the
lunch
hour
now
and
again
the
fat
man
paused
in
his
vocal
efforts
to
reprimand
her
for
her
slackness
she
paid
no
heed
there
was
something
gruesome
uncanny
about
the
way
her
fingers
went
their
own
way
over
the
defenceless
keys
her
conversation
with
the
frowzy
little
girl
went
on
wha
he
say
over
her
shoulder
oh
he
laffed
well
didja
go
me
well
whutya
think
i
yam
anyway
i
woulda
took
a
chanst
the
fat
man
rebelled
look
here
get
busy
what
are
you
paid
for
talkin
or
playin
huh
the
person
at
the
piano
openly
reproved
thus
before
her
friend
lifted
her
uninspired
hands
from
the
keys
and
spake
when
she
had
finished
she
rose
but
you
ca
leave
now
the
megaphone
man
argued
right
in
the
rush
hour
i
gone
said
the
girl
the
fat
man
looked
about
helplessly
he
gazed
at
the
abandoned
piano
as
though
it
must
go
on
of
its
own
accord
then
at
the
crowd
where
miss
schwimmer
he
demanded
of
a
clerk
out
to
lunch
terry
pushed
her
way
to
the
edge
of
the
counter
and
leaned
over
i
can
play
for
you
she
said
the
man
looked
at
her
sight
yes
come
on
terry
went
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
counter
took
off
her
hat
and
coat
rubbed
her
hands
together
briskly
sat
down
and
began
to
play
the
crowd
edged
closer
it
is
a
curious
study
this
noonday
crowd
that
gathers
to
sate
its
on
the
scraps
vouchsafed
it
by
bernie
gottschalk
music
house
young
men
with
bad
complexions
and
slender
hands
girls
whose
clothes
are
an
unconscious
satire
on
fashions
on
their
faces
as
they
listen
to
the
music
is
a
look
of
peace
and
dreaming
they
stand
about
smiling
a
wistful
half
smile
it
is
much
the
same
expression
that
steals
over
the
face
of
a
smoker
who
has
lighted
his
cigar
or
of
a
drug
victim
who
is
being
lulled
by
his
opiate
the
music
seems
to
satisfy
a
something
within
them
faces
dull
eyes
lustreless
they
listen
in
a
sort
of
trance
terry
played
on
she
played
as
terry
sheehan
used
to
play
she
played
as
no
music
hack
at
bernie
gottschalk
had
ever
played
before
the
crowd
swayed
a
little
to
the
sound
of
it
some
kept
time
with
little
jerks
of
the
shoulder
the
little
hitching
movement
of
the
dancer
whose
blood
is
filled
with
the
fever
of
syncopation
even
the
crowd
flowing
down
state
street
must
have
caught
the
rhythm
of
it
for
the
room
soon
filled
at
two
the
crowd
began
to
thin
business
would
be
slack
now
until
five
when
it
would
again
pick
up
until
closing
time
at
six
the
fat
vocalist
put
down
his
megaphone
wiped
his
forehead
and
regarded
terry
with
a
warm
blue
eye
he
had
just
finished
singing
wandered
far
from
dear
old
mother
knee
bernie
gottschalk
chicago
new
york
you
ca
get
bit
with
a
gottschalk
hit
cents
each
girlie
he
said
emphatically
you
sure
can
play
he
came
over
to
her
at
the
piano
and
put
a
stubby
hand
on
her
shoulder
yessir
those
little
fingers
terry
just
turned
her
head
to
look
down
her
nose
at
the
moist
hand
resting
on
her
shoulder
those
little
fingers
are
going
to
meet
your
face
suddenly
if
you
do
move
on
who
gave
you
your
job
demanded
the
fat
man
nobody
i
picked
it
myself
you
can
have
it
if
you
want
it
ca
you
take
a
joke
label
yours
as
the
crowd
dwindled
she
played
less
feverishly
but
there
was
nothing
slipshod
about
her
performance
the
chubby
songster
found
time
to
proffer
brief
explanations
in
asides
they
want
the
patriotic
stuff
it
used
to
be
all
that
hawaiian
dope
and
wild
irish
rose
junk
and
songs
about
wanting
to
go
back
to
every
place
from
dixie
to
duluth
but
now
seems
it
all
these
here
flag
raisers
honestly
i
so
sick
of
i
got
a
notion
to
enlist
to
get
away
from
it
terry
eyed
him
with
withering
briefness
a
little
training
ruin
your
figure
she
had
never
objected
to
orville
but
then
orville
was
a
different
sort
of
fat
man
springy
immaculate
at
four
as
she
was
in
the
chorus
of
is
there
another
joan
of
arc
a
melting
masculine
voice
from
the
other
side
of
the
counter
said
pardon
me
what
that
you
playing
terry
told
him
she
did
not
look
up
i
would
have
known
it
played
like
that
a
second
marseillaise
if
the
words
what
are
the
words
let
me
see
a
show
the
gentleman
a
terry
commanded
briefly
over
her
shoulder
the
fat
man
laughed
a
wheezy
laugh
terry
glanced
around
still
playing
and
encountered
the
gaze
of
two
melting
masculine
eyes
that
matched
the
melting
masculine
voice
the
songster
waved
a
hand
uniting
terry
and
the
eyes
in
informal
introduction
leon
sammett
the
gentleman
who
sings
the
gottschalk
songs
wherever
songs
are
heard
and
that
is
and
sammett
terry
turned
a
sleek
swarthy
young
man
with
the
fashionable
concave
torso
and
alarmingly
convex
glasses
through
them
his
darkly
luminous
gaze
glowed
upon
terry
to
escape
their
warmth
she
sent
her
own
gaze
past
him
to
encounter
the
arctic
stare
of
the
large
blonde
person
who
had
been
included
so
lamely
in
the
introduction
and
at
that
the
frigidity
of
that
stare
softened
melted
dissolved
why
terry
sheehan
what
in
the
world
terry
eyes
bored
beneath
the
layers
of
flabby
fat
it
why
ruby
watson
is
it
eccentric
song
and
dance
she
glanced
at
the
concave
young
man
and
faltered
he
was
not
jim
of
the
bijou
days
from
him
her
eyes
leaped
back
to
the
splendour
of
the
woman
the
plump
face
went
so
painfully
red
that
the
makeup
stood
out
on
it
a
distinct
layer
like
thin
ice
covering
flowing
water
as
she
surveyed
that
bulk
terry
realised
that
while
ruby
might
still
claim
eccentricity
her
song
and
dance
days
were
over
ancient
history
i
have
been
working
for
three
years
you
doing
in
this
joint
i
heard
you
done
well
for
yourself
that
you
were
married
i
am
that
is
i
well
i
am
i
at
that
the
dark
young
man
leaned
over
and
patted
terry
hand
that
lay
on
the
counter
he
smiled
his
own
hand
was
incredibly
slender
long
and
tapering
that
all
right
he
assured
her
and
smiled
you
two
girls
can
have
a
reunion
later
what
i
want
to
know
is
can
you
play
by
ear
yes
but
he
leaned
far
over
the
counter
i
knew
it
the
minute
i
heard
you
play
you
got
the
touch
now
listen
see
if
you
can
get
this
and
fake
the
bass
he
fixed
his
sombre
and
hypnotic
eyes
on
terry
his
mouth
screwed
up
into
a
whistle
the
tune
a
tawdry
but
haunting
little
melody
came
through
his
lips
and
terry
quick
ear
sensed
that
every
note
was
flat
she
turned
back
to
the
piano
of
course
you
know
you
flatted
every
note
she
said
this
time
it
was
the
blonde
woman
who
laughed
and
the
man
who
flushed
terry
cocked
her
head
just
a
little
to
one
side
like
a
knowing
bird
looked
up
into
space
beyond
the
piano
top
and
played
the
lilting
little
melody
with
charm
and
fidelity
the
dark
young
man
followed
her
with
a
wagging
of
the
head
and
little
jerks
of
both
outspread
hands
his
expression
was
beatific
enraptured
he
hummed
a
little
under
his
breath
and
any
one
who
was
music
wise
would
have
known
that
he
was
just
a
behind
her
all
the
way
when
she
had
finished
he
sighed
deeply
ecstatically
he
bent
his
lean
frame
over
the
counter
and
despite
his
swart
colouring
seemed
to
glitter
upon
her
his
eyes
his
teeth
his
very
something
led
me
here
i
never
come
up
on
tuesdays
but
something
you
was
going
to
complain
put
in
his
lady
heavily
about
that
teddy
sykes
at
the
palace
gardens
singing
the
same
songs
this
week
that
you
been
boosting
at
the
inn
he
put
up
a
vibrant
peremptory
hand
bah
what
does
that
matter
now
what
does
anything
matter
now
listen
miss
ah
miss
pl
sheehan
terry
sheehan
he
gazed
off
a
moment
into
space
h
sammett
in
songs
miss
terry
sheehan
at
the
piano
that
does
sound
bad
now
listen
miss
sheehan
i
singing
down
at
the
university
inn
the
gottschalk
song
hits
i
guess
you
know
my
work
but
i
want
to
talk
to
you
private
something
to
your
interest
i
go
on
down
at
the
inn
at
six
will
you
come
and
have
a
little
something
with
ruby
and
me
now
now
faltered
terry
somewhat
helplessly
things
seemed
to
be
moving
rather
swiftly
for
her
accustomed
as
she
was
to
the
peaceful
routine
of
the
past
four
years
get
your
hat
it
your
life
chance
wait
till
you
see
your
name
in
electrics
over
the
front
of
every
house
in
the
country
you
got
music
in
you
tie
to
me
and
you
made
he
turned
to
the
woman
beside
him
is
that
so
rube
sure
look
at
one
would
not
have
thought
there
could
be
so
much
subtle
vindictiveness
in
a
fat
blonde
sammett
whipped
out
a
watch
just
of
an
hour
come
on
girlie
his
conversation
had
been
conducted
in
an
urgent
undertone
with
side
glances
at
the
fat
man
with
the
megaphone
terry
approached
him
now
i
leaving
now
she
said
oh
no
you
not
six
is
your
quitting
time
in
which
he
touched
the
irish
in
terry
any
time
i
quit
is
my
quitting
time
she
went
in
quest
of
hat
and
coat
much
as
the
girl
had
done
whose
place
she
had
taken
early
in
the
day
the
fat
man
followed
her
protesting
terry
pinning
on
her
hat
tried
to
ignore
him
but
he
laid
one
plump
hand
on
her
arm
and
kept
it
there
though
she
tried
to
shake
him
off
now
listen
to
me
that
boy
would
mind
putting
his
heel
on
your
face
if
he
thought
it
would
bring
him
up
a
step
i
know
that
walking
stick
he
carrying
well
compared
to
the
yellow
stripe
that
in
him
that
cane
is
a
lead
pencil
he
a
song
tout
that
all
he
is
then
more
feverishly
as
terry
tried
to
pull
away
wait
a
minute
you
a
decent
girl
i
want
to
why
he
ca
even
sing
a
note
without
you
give
it
to
him
first
he
can
put
a
song
over
yes
but
how
by
flashin
that
toothy
grin
of
his
and
talkin
every
word
of
it
do
you
but
terry
freed
herself
with
a
final
jerk
and
whipped
around
the
counter
the
two
who
had
been
talking
together
in
an
undertone
turned
to
welcome
her
we
got
a
half
hour
come
on
it
just
over
to
clark
and
up
a
block
or
so
if
you
know
chicago
at
all
you
know
the
university
inn
that
gloriously
intercollegiate
institution
which
welcomes
any
graduate
of
any
school
of
experience
and
guarantees
a
course
in
less
time
than
any
similar
haven
of
knowledge
down
a
flight
of
stairs
and
into
the
unwonted
quiet
that
reigns
during
the
hour
of
low
potentiality
between
five
and
six
the
three
went
and
seated
themselves
at
a
table
in
an
obscure
corner
a
waiter
brought
them
things
in
little
glasses
though
no
order
had
been
given
the
woman
who
had
been
ruby
watson
was
so
silent
as
to
be
almost
wordless
but
the
man
talked
rapidly
he
talked
well
too
the
same
quality
that
enabled
him
voiceless
though
he
was
to
boost
a
song
to
success
was
making
his
plea
sound
plausible
in
terry
ears
now
i
got
to
go
and
make
up
in
a
few
minutes
so
get
this
i
not
going
to
stick
down
in
this
basement
eating
house
forever
i
got
too
much
talent
if
i
only
had
a
voice
i
mean
a
singing
voice
but
i
have
but
then
neither
has
georgie
cohan
and
i
ca
see
that
it
wrecked
his
life
any
look
at
elsie
janis
but
she
sings
and
they
like
it
now
listen
i
got
a
song
it
my
own
that
bit
you
played
for
me
up
at
gottschalk
is
part
of
the
chorus
but
it
the
words
that
go
big
they
great
it
an
aviation
song
see
airship
stuff
yelling
that
it
the
airyoplanes
that
going
to
win
this
war
well
i
help
this
song
is
going
to
put
the
aviator
where
he
belongs
it
going
to
be
the
big
song
of
the
war
it
going
to
make
sound
like
a
moody
and
sankey
hymn
it
the
ruby
lifted
her
eyes
and
sent
him
a
meaning
look
get
down
to
business
leon
i
tell
her
how
good
you
are
while
making
up
he
shot
her
a
malignant
glance
but
took
her
advice
now
what
i
been
looking
for
for
years
is
somebody
who
has
got
the
music
knack
to
give
me
the
accompaniment
just
a
quarter
of
a
jump
ahead
of
my
voice
see
i
can
follow
like
a
lamb
but
i
got
to
have
that
feeler
first
it
more
than
a
knack
it
a
gift
and
you
got
it
i
know
it
when
i
see
it
i
want
to
get
away
from
this
cabaret
thing
there
nothing
in
it
for
a
man
of
my
talent
i
gunning
for
vaudeville
but
they
wo
book
me
without
a
tryout
and
when
they
hear
my
voice
they
well
if
me
and
you
work
together
we
can
fool
the
song
great
and
my
makeup
one
of
these
costumes
to
go
with
the
song
see
pants
tight
in
the
knee
and
baggy
on
the
hips
and
a
coat
with
one
of
those
full
skirt
peplums
put
in
ruby
placidly
sure
and
the
girls
be
wild
about
it
and
the
words
he
began
to
sing
gratingly
put
on
your
sky
clothes
put
on
your
fly
clothes
and
take
a
trip
with
me
we
sail
so
high
up
in
the
sky
we
drop
a
bomb
from
mercury
why
that
awfully
cute
exclaimed
terry
until
now
her
opinion
of
sammett
talents
had
not
been
on
a
level
with
his
yeh
but
wait
till
you
hear
the
second
verse
that
only
part
of
the
chorus
you
see
he
supposed
to
be
talking
to
a
french
girl
he
says
i
in
fran√ßais
plain
you
answer
we
both
the
six
lights
blazed
up
suddenly
a
group
of
men
trailed
in
and
made
for
a
corner
where
certain
bulky
shapeless
bundles
were
soon
revealed
as
those
glittering
and
tortuous
instruments
which
go
to
make
a
jazz
band
you
better
go
lee
the
crowd
comes
in
awful
early
now
with
all
those
buyers
in
town
both
hands
on
the
table
he
half
rose
reluctantly
still
talking
got
three
other
songs
they
make
gottschalk
stuff
look
sick
all
i
want
a
chance
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
accompaniment
on
the
stage
see
grand
piano
and
a
swell
set
i
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
to
it
but
a
kind
of
an
army
camp
room
see
and
maybe
you
dressed
as
liberty
anyway
it
be
new
and
a
if
only
we
can
get
away
with
the
voice
thing
say
if
eddie
foy
all
those
years
never
had
a
the
band
opened
with
a
terrifying
clash
of
cymbal
and
thump
of
drum
back
at
the
end
of
my
first
turn
he
said
as
he
fled
terry
followed
his
lithe
electric
figure
she
turned
to
meet
the
gaze
of
the
woman
seated
opposite
she
relaxed
then
and
sat
back
with
a
little
sigh
well
if
he
talks
that
way
to
the
managers
i
do
see
ruby
laughed
a
mirthless
little
laugh
talk
does
get
it
over
with
the
managers
honey
you
got
to
deliver
well
but
he
that
song
a
good
one
i
do
say
it
as
good
as
he
thinks
it
is
but
it
good
yes
admitted
the
woman
grudgingly
it
good
well
then
the
woman
beckoned
a
waiter
he
nodded
and
vanished
and
reappeared
with
a
glass
that
was
twin
to
the
one
she
had
just
emptied
does
he
look
like
he
knew
french
or
could
make
a
rhyme
but
did
he
does
he
the
words
were
written
by
a
little
french
girl
who
used
to
skate
down
here
last
winter
when
the
craze
was
on
she
was
stuck
on
a
chicago
kid
who
went
over
to
fly
for
the
french
but
the
music
there
was
a
russian
girl
who
used
to
dance
in
the
cabaret
and
she
terry
head
came
up
with
a
characteristic
little
jerk
i
do
believe
it
better
she
gazed
at
terry
with
the
drowsy
look
that
was
so
different
from
the
quick
clear
glance
of
the
ruby
watson
who
used
to
dance
so
nimbly
in
the
old
bijou
days
what
you
and
your
husband
quarrel
about
terry
terry
was
furious
to
feel
herself
flushing
oh
nothing
he
just
i
it
was
say
how
did
you
know
we
quarrelled
and
suddenly
all
the
fat
woman
apathy
dropped
from
her
like
a
garment
and
some
of
the
old
sparkle
and
animation
illumined
her
heavy
face
she
pushed
her
glass
aside
and
leaned
forward
on
her
folded
arms
so
that
her
face
was
close
to
terry
terry
sheehan
i
know
you
quarrelled
and
i
know
just
what
it
was
about
oh
i
do
mean
the
very
thing
it
was
about
but
the
kind
of
thing
i
going
to
do
something
for
you
terry
that
i
would
take
the
trouble
to
do
for
most
women
but
i
guess
i
ai
had
all
the
softness
knocked
out
of
me
yet
though
it
a
wonder
and
i
guess
i
remember
too
plain
the
decent
kid
you
was
in
the
old
days
what
was
the
name
of
that
little
house
me
and
jim
used
to
play
bijou
that
it
bijou
the
band
struck
up
a
new
tune
leon
sammett
slim
sleek
lithe
in
his
evening
clothes
appeared
with
a
little
fair
girl
in
pink
chiffon
the
woman
reached
across
the
table
and
put
one
pudgy
jewelled
hand
on
terry
arm
he
be
through
in
ten
minutes
now
listen
to
me
i
left
jim
four
years
ago
and
there
has
been
a
minute
since
then
day
or
night
when
i
would
have
crawled
back
to
him
on
my
hands
and
knees
if
i
could
but
i
could
he
would
have
me
now
how
could
he
how
do
i
know
you
quarrelled
i
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
they
look
just
the
way
mine
have
felt
for
four
years
that
how
i
met
up
with
this
boy
and
there
was
anybody
to
do
the
turn
for
me
that
i
trying
to
do
for
you
now
get
this
i
left
jim
because
when
he
ate
corn
on
the
cob
he
always
closed
his
eyes
and
it
drove
me
wild
do
laugh
i
not
laughing
said
terry
women
are
like
that
one
night
we
was
playing
fond
du
lac
i
remember
just
as
plain
we
was
eating
supper
and
jim
reached
for
one
of
those
big
yellow
ears
and
buttered
and
salted
it
and
me
kind
of
hanging
on
to
the
edge
of
the
table
with
my
nails
seemed
to
me
if
he
shut
his
eyes
when
he
put
his
teeth
into
that
ear
of
corn
i
scream
and
he
did
and
i
screamed
and
that
all
terry
sat
staring
at
her
with
a
stare
like
a
sleep
walker
then
she
wet
her
lips
slowly
but
that
almost
the
very
kid
go
on
back
home
i
do
know
whether
it
too
late
or
not
but
go
anyway
if
you
lost
him
i
suppose
it
ai
any
more
than
you
deserve
but
i
hope
to
god
you
do
get
your
desserts
this
time
he
almost
through
if
he
sees
you
going
he
ca
quit
in
the
middle
of
his
song
to
stop
you
he
know
i
put
you
wise
and
he
half
kill
me
for
it
but
it
worth
it
you
get
and
terry
dazed
shaking
but
grateful
fled
down
the
noisy
aisle
up
the
stairs
to
the
street
back
to
her
rooming
house
out
again
with
her
suitcase
and
into
the
right
railroad
station
somehow
at
last
not
another
wetona
train
until
midnight
she
shrank
into
a
remote
corner
of
the
waiting
room
and
there
she
huddled
until
midnight
watching
the
entrances
like
a
child
who
is
fearful
of
ghosts
in
the
night
the
hands
of
the
station
clock
seemed
fixed
and
immovable
the
hour
between
eleven
and
twelve
was
endless
she
was
on
the
train
it
was
almost
morning
it
was
morning
dawn
was
breaking
she
was
home
she
had
the
house
key
clutched
tightly
in
her
hand
long
before
she
turned
schroeder
corner
suppose
he
had
come
home
suppose
he
had
jumped
a
town
and
come
home
ahead
of
his
schedule
they
had
quarrelled
once
before
and
he
had
done
that
up
the
front
steps
into
the
house
not
a
sound
she
stood
there
a
moment
in
the
early
morning
she
peered
into
the
dining
room
the
table
with
its
breakfast
d√©bris
was
as
she
had
left
it
in
the
kitchen
the
coffee
pot
stood
on
the
gas
stove
she
was
home
she
was
safe
she
ran
up
the
stairs
got
out
of
her
clothes
and
into
crisp
gingham
morning
things
she
flung
open
windows
everywhere
once
more
she
plunged
into
an
orgy
of
cleaning
dishes
table
stove
floor
rugs
she
washed
scoured
flapped
swabbed
polished
by
eight
she
had
done
the
work
that
would
ordinarily
have
taken
until
noon
the
house
was
shining
orderly
and
redolent
of
soapsuds
during
all
this
time
she
had
been
listening
listening
with
her
ear
listening
for
something
she
had
refused
to
name
definitely
in
her
mind
but
listening
just
the
same
waiting
and
then
at
eight
it
came
the
rattle
of
a
key
in
the
lock
the
boom
of
the
front
door
firm
footsteps
he
did
not
go
to
meet
her
and
she
did
not
go
to
meet
him
they
came
together
and
were
in
each
other
arms
she
was
weeping
now
now
old
girl
what
there
to
cry
about
do
honey
do
it
all
right
she
raised
her
head
then
to
look
at
him
how
fresh
and
rosy
and
big
he
seemed
after
that
little
sallow
yellow
restaurant
rat
how
did
you
get
here
how
did
you
happen
jumped
all
the
way
from
ashland
could
get
a
sleeper
so
i
sat
up
all
night
i
had
to
come
back
and
square
things
with
you
terry
my
mind
just
was
on
my
work
i
kept
thinking
how
i
talked
how
talked
oh
orville
do
i
ca
bear
have
you
had
your
breakfast
why
no
the
train
was
an
hour
late
you
know
that
ashland
train
but
she
was
out
of
his
arms
and
making
for
the
kitchen
you
go
and
clean
up
i
have
hot
biscuits
and
everything
in
fifteen
minutes
you
poor
boy
no
breakfast
she
made
good
her
promise
it
could
not
have
been
more
than
twenty
minutes
later
when
he
was
buttering
his
third
feathery
golden
brown
biscuit
but
she
had
eaten
nothing
she
watched
him
and
listened
and
again
her
eyes
were
sombre
but
for
a
different
reason
he
broke
open
his
egg
his
elbow
came
up
just
a
fraction
of
an
inch
then
he
remembered
and
flushed
like
a
schoolboy
and
brought
it
down
again
carefully
and
at
that
she
gave
a
little
tremulous
cry
and
rushed
around
the
table
to
him
oh
orville
she
took
the
offending
elbow
in
her
two
arms
and
bent
and
kissed
the
rough
coat
sleeve
why
terry
do
honey
do
oh
orville
listen
yes
listen
orville
i
listening
terry
i
got
something
to
tell
you
there
something
you
got
to
know
yes
i
know
it
terry
i
knew
you
out
with
it
pretty
soon
if
i
just
waited
she
lifted
an
amazed
face
from
his
shoulder
then
and
stared
at
him
but
how
could
you
know
you
could
how
could
you
he
patted
her
shoulder
then
gently
i
can
always
tell
when
you
have
something
on
your
mind
you
always
take
up
a
spoon
of
coffee
and
look
at
it
and
kind
of
joggle
it
back
and
forth
in
the
spoon
and
then
dribble
it
back
into
the
cup
again
without
once
tasting
it
it
used
to
get
me
nervous
when
we
were
first
married
watching
you
but
now
i
know
it
just
means
you
worried
about
something
and
i
wait
and
pretty
soon
oh
orville
she
cried
then
oh
orville
now
terry
just
spill
it
hon
just
spill
it
to
daddy
and
you
feel
better
vi
the
woman
who
tried
to
be
good
before
she
tried
to
be
a
good
woman
she
had
been
a
very
bad
woman
so
bad
that
she
could
trail
her
wonderful
apparel
up
and
down
main
street
from
the
elm
tree
bakery
to
the
railroad
tracks
without
once
having
a
man
doff
his
hat
to
her
or
a
woman
bow
you
passed
her
on
the
street
with
a
surreptitious
glance
though
she
was
well
worth
looking
at
in
her
furs
and
laces
and
plumes
she
had
the
only
sealskin
coat
in
our
town
and
ganz
shoe
store
sent
to
chicago
for
her
shoes
hers
were
the
miraculously
small
feet
you
frequently
see
in
stout
women
usually
she
walked
alone
but
on
rare
occasions
especially
round
christmas
time
she
might
have
been
seen
accompanied
by
some
silent
girl
who
would
follow
her
dumbly
in
and
out
of
stores
stopping
now
and
then
to
admire
a
cheap
comb
or
a
chain
set
with
flashy
imitation
stones
or
queerly
enough
a
doll
with
yellow
hair
and
blue
eyes
and
very
pink
cheeks
but
alone
or
in
company
her
appearance
in
the
stores
of
our
town
was
the
signal
for
a
sudden
jump
in
the
cost
of
living
the
storekeepers
mulcted
her
and
she
knew
it
and
paid
in
silence
for
she
was
of
the
class
that
has
no
redress
she
owned
the
house
with
the
closed
shutters
near
the
freight
depot
did
blanche
devine
and
beneath
her
silks
and
laces
and
furs
there
was
a
scarlet
letter
on
her
breast
in
a
larger
town
than
ours
she
would
have
passed
unnoticed
she
did
not
look
like
a
bad
woman
of
course
she
used
too
much
perfumed
white
powder
and
as
she
passed
you
caught
the
oversweet
breath
of
a
certain
heavy
scent
then
too
her
diamond
eardrops
would
have
made
any
features
look
hard
but
her
plump
face
in
spite
of
its
heaviness
wore
an
expression
of
intelligence
and
her
eyeglasses
gave
her
somehow
a
look
of
respectability
we
do
not
associate
vice
with
eyeglasses
so
in
a
large
city
she
would
have
passed
for
a
prosperous
comfortable
wife
and
mother
who
was
in
danger
of
losing
her
figure
from
an
overabundance
of
good
living
but
with
us
she
was
a
town
character
like
old
man
givins
the
drunkard
or
the
binns
girl
when
she
passed
the
corner
there
would
be
a
sniggering
among
the
loafers
idling
there
and
they
would
leer
at
each
other
and
jest
in
undertones
so
knowing
blanche
devine
as
we
did
there
was
something
resembling
a
riot
in
one
of
our
most
respectable
neighbourhoods
when
it
was
learned
that
she
had
given
up
her
interest
in
the
house
near
the
freight
depot
and
was
going
to
settle
down
in
the
white
cottage
on
the
corner
and
be
good
all
the
husbands
in
the
block
urged
on
by
righteously
indignant
wives
dropped
in
on
alderman
mooney
after
supper
to
see
if
the
thing
could
not
be
stopped
the
fourth
of
the
protesting
husbands
to
arrive
was
the
very
young
husband
who
lived
next
door
to
the
corner
cottage
that
blanche
devine
had
bought
the
very
young
husband
had
a
very
young
wife
and
they
were
the
joint
owners
of
snooky
snooky
was
and
looked
something
like
an
angel
only
healthier
and
with
grimier
hands
the
whole
neighbourhood
borrowed
her
and
tried
to
spoil
her
but
snooky
would
not
spoil
alderman
mooney
was
down
in
the
cellar
fooling
with
the
furnace
he
was
in
his
furnace
overalls
a
short
black
pipe
in
his
mouth
three
protesting
husbands
had
just
left
as
the
very
young
husband
following
mooney
directions
cautiously
descended
the
cellar
stairs
alderman
mooney
looked
up
from
his
tinkering
he
peered
through
a
haze
of
hello
he
called
and
waved
the
haze
away
with
his
open
palm
come
on
down
been
tinkering
with
this
blamed
furnace
since
supper
she
draw
like
she
ought
toward
spring
a
furnace
always
gets
balky
how
many
tons
you
used
this
winter
oh
ten
said
the
very
young
husband
shortly
alderman
mooney
considered
it
thoughtfully
the
young
husband
leaned
up
against
the
side
of
the
cistern
his
hands
in
his
pockets
say
mooney
is
that
right
about
blanche
devine
having
bought
the
house
on
the
corner
you
the
fourth
man
that
been
in
to
ask
me
that
this
evening
expecting
the
rest
of
the
block
before
bedtime
she
bought
it
all
right
the
young
husband
flushed
and
kicked
at
a
piece
of
coal
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
well
it
a
darned
shame
he
began
hotly
jen
was
ready
to
cry
at
supper
this
be
a
fine
neighbourhood
for
snooky
to
grow
up
in
a
woman
like
that
want
to
come
into
a
respectable
street
for
anyway
i
own
my
home
and
pay
my
taxes
alderman
mooney
looked
up
so
does
she
he
interrupted
she
going
to
improve
the
place
paint
it
and
put
in
a
cellar
and
a
furnace
and
build
a
porch
and
lay
a
cement
walk
all
round
the
young
husband
took
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
in
order
to
emphasize
his
remarks
with
gestures
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
i
do
care
if
she
puts
in
diamonds
for
windows
and
sets
out
italian
gardens
and
a
terrace
with
peacocks
on
it
you
the
alderman
of
this
ward
are
you
well
it
was
up
to
you
to
keep
her
out
of
this
block
you
could
have
fixed
it
with
an
injunction
or
something
i
going
to
get
up
a
petition
that
what
i
going
alderman
mooney
closed
the
furnace
door
with
a
bang
that
drowned
the
rest
of
the
threat
he
turned
the
draft
in
a
pipe
overhead
and
brushed
his
sooty
palms
briskly
together
like
one
who
would
put
an
end
to
a
profitless
conversation
she
bought
the
house
he
said
mildly
and
paid
for
it
and
hers
she
got
a
right
to
live
in
this
neighbourhood
as
long
as
she
acts
respectable
the
very
young
husband
laughed
she
wo
last
they
never
do
alderman
mooney
had
taken
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
was
rubbing
his
thumb
over
the
smooth
bowl
looking
down
at
it
with
unseeing
eyes
on
his
face
was
a
queer
look
the
look
of
one
who
is
embarrassed
because
he
is
about
to
say
something
honest
look
here
i
want
to
tell
you
something
i
happened
to
be
up
in
the
mayor
office
the
day
blanche
signed
for
the
place
she
had
to
go
through
a
lot
of
red
tape
before
she
got
it
had
quite
a
time
of
it
she
did
and
say
kid
that
woman
ai
so
bad
the
very
young
husband
exclaimed
impatiently
oh
do
give
me
any
of
that
mooney
blanche
devine
a
town
character
even
the
kids
know
what
she
is
if
she
got
religion
or
something
and
wants
to
quit
and
be
decent
why
does
she
go
to
another
town
chicago
or
some
place
where
nobody
knows
her
that
motion
of
alderman
mooney
thumb
against
the
smooth
pipebowl
stopped
he
looked
up
slowly
that
what
i
said
the
mayor
too
but
blanche
devine
said
she
wanted
to
try
it
here
she
said
this
was
home
to
her
funny
ai
it
said
she
would
be
fooling
anybody
here
they
know
her
and
if
she
moved
away
she
said
it
leak
out
some
way
sooner
or
later
it
does
she
said
always
seems
she
wants
to
live
like
well
like
other
women
she
put
it
like
this
she
says
she
has
got
religion
or
any
of
that
she
says
she
no
different
than
she
was
when
she
was
twenty
she
says
that
for
the
last
ten
years
the
ambition
of
her
life
has
been
to
be
able
to
go
into
a
grocery
store
and
ask
the
price
of
say
celery
and
if
the
clerk
charged
her
ten
when
it
ought
to
be
seven
to
be
able
to
sass
him
with
a
regular
piece
of
her
mind
and
then
sail
out
and
trade
somewhere
else
until
he
saw
that
she
did
have
to
stand
anything
from
storekeepers
any
more
than
any
other
woman
that
did
her
own
marketing
she
a
smart
woman
blanche
is
she
saved
her
money
god
knows
i
ai
taking
her
part
exactly
but
she
talked
a
little
and
the
mayor
and
me
got
a
little
of
her
history
a
sneer
appeared
on
the
face
of
the
very
young
husband
he
had
been
known
before
he
met
jen
as
a
rather
industrious
sower
of
that
seed
known
as
wild
oats
he
knew
a
thing
or
two
did
the
very
young
husband
in
spite
of
his
youth
he
always
fussed
when
jen
wore
even
a
summer
gown
on
the
street
oh
she
was
playing
for
sympathy
west
on
alderman
mooney
in
answer
to
the
sneer
she
said
she
always
paid
her
way
and
always
expected
to
seems
her
husband
left
her
without
a
cent
when
she
was
eighteen
with
a
baby
she
worked
for
four
dollars
a
week
in
a
cheap
eating
house
the
two
of
could
live
on
that
then
the
baby
good
night
said
the
very
young
husband
i
suppose
going
to
call
minnie
it
was
her
scolding
all
through
supper
that
drove
me
down
to
monkey
with
the
furnace
she
wild
minnie
is
he
peeled
off
his
overalls
and
hung
them
on
a
nail
the
young
husband
started
to
ascend
the
cellar
stairs
alderman
mooney
laid
a
detaining
finger
on
his
sleeve
do
say
anything
in
front
of
minnie
she
boiling
minnie
and
the
kids
are
going
to
visit
her
folks
out
west
this
summer
so
i
would
so
much
as
dare
to
say
morning
to
the
devine
woman
anyway
a
person
would
talk
to
her
i
suppose
but
i
kind
of
thought
i
tell
you
about
her
thanks
said
the
very
young
husband
dryly
in
the
early
spring
before
blanche
devine
moved
in
there
came
stonemasons
who
began
to
build
something
it
was
a
great
stone
fireplace
that
rose
in
massive
incongruity
at
the
side
of
the
little
white
cottage
blanche
devine
was
trying
to
make
a
home
for
herself
we
no
longer
build
fireplaces
for
physical
warmth
we
build
them
for
the
warmth
of
the
soul
we
build
them
to
dream
by
to
hope
by
to
home
by
blanche
devine
used
to
come
and
watch
them
now
and
then
as
the
work
progressed
she
had
a
way
of
walking
round
and
round
the
house
looking
up
at
it
pridefully
and
poking
at
plaster
and
paint
with
her
umbrella
or
fingertip
one
day
she
brought
with
her
a
man
with
a
spade
he
spaded
up
a
neat
square
of
ground
at
the
side
of
the
cottage
and
a
long
ridge
near
the
fence
that
separated
her
yard
from
that
of
the
very
young
couple
next
door
the
ridge
spelled
sweet
peas
and
nasturtiums
to
our
eyes
on
the
day
that
blanche
devine
moved
in
there
was
wild
agitation
among
the
bedroom
curtains
of
the
neighbourhood
later
on
certain
odours
as
of
burning
dinners
pervaded
the
atmosphere
blanche
devine
flushed
and
excited
her
hair
slightly
askew
her
diamond
eardrops
flashing
directed
the
moving
wrapped
in
her
great
fur
coat
but
on
the
third
morning
we
gasped
when
she
appeared
carrying
a
little
household
ladder
a
pail
of
steaming
water
and
sundry
voluminous
white
cloths
she
reared
the
little
ladder
against
the
side
of
the
house
mounted
it
cautiously
and
began
to
wash
windows
with
housewifely
thoroughness
her
stout
figure
was
swathed
in
a
grey
sweater
and
on
her
head
was
a
battered
felt
hat
the
sort
of
costume
that
has
been
worn
by
women
from
time
immemorial
we
noticed
that
she
used
plenty
of
hot
water
and
clean
rags
and
that
she
rubbed
the
glass
until
it
sparkled
leaning
perilously
sideways
on
the
ladder
to
detect
elusive
streaks
our
keenest
housekeeping
eye
could
find
no
fault
with
the
way
blanche
devine
washed
windows
by
may
blanche
devine
had
left
off
her
diamond
eardrops
perhaps
it
was
their
absence
that
gave
her
face
a
new
expression
when
she
went
down
town
we
noticed
that
her
hats
were
more
like
the
hats
the
other
women
in
our
town
wore
but
she
still
affected
extravagant
footgear
as
is
right
and
proper
for
a
stout
woman
who
has
cause
to
be
vain
of
her
feet
we
noticed
that
her
trips
down
town
were
rare
that
spring
and
summer
she
used
to
come
home
laden
with
little
bundles
and
before
supper
she
would
change
her
street
clothes
for
a
neat
washable
housedress
as
is
our
thrifty
custom
through
her
bright
windows
we
could
see
her
moving
briskly
about
from
kitchen
to
sitting
room
and
from
the
smells
that
floated
out
from
her
kitchen
door
she
seemed
to
be
preparing
for
her
solitary
supper
the
same
homely
viands
that
were
frying
or
stewing
or
baking
in
our
kitchens
sometimes
you
could
detect
the
delectable
scent
of
browning
hot
tea
biscuit
it
takes
a
brave
courageous
determined
woman
to
make
tea
biscuit
for
no
one
but
herself
blanche
devine
joined
the
church
on
the
first
sunday
morning
she
came
to
the
service
there
was
a
little
flurry
among
the
ushers
at
the
vestibule
door
they
seated
her
well
in
the
rear
the
second
sunday
morning
a
dreadful
thing
happened
the
woman
next
to
whom
they
seated
her
turned
regarded
her
stonily
for
a
moment
then
rose
agitatedly
and
moved
to
a
pew
across
the
aisle
blanche
devine
face
went
a
dull
red
beneath
her
white
powder
she
never
came
again
though
we
saw
the
minister
visit
her
once
or
twice
she
always
accompanied
him
to
the
door
pleasantly
holding
it
well
open
until
he
was
down
the
little
flight
of
steps
and
on
the
sidewalk
the
minister
wife
did
not
call
but
then
there
are
limits
to
the
duties
of
a
minister
wife
she
rose
early
like
the
rest
of
us
and
as
summer
came
on
we
used
to
see
her
moving
about
in
her
little
garden
patch
in
the
dewy
golden
morning
she
wore
absurd
kimonos
that
made
her
stout
figure
loom
immense
against
the
greenery
of
garden
and
apple
tree
the
neighbourhood
women
viewed
these
neglig√©es
with
puritan
disapproval
as
they
smoothed
down
their
own
prim
starched
gingham
skirts
they
said
it
was
disgusting
and
perhaps
it
was
but
the
habit
of
years
is
not
easily
overcome
blanche
devine
snipping
her
sweet
peas
peering
anxiously
at
the
virginia
creeper
that
clung
with
such
fragile
fingers
to
the
trellis
watering
the
flower
baskets
that
hung
from
her
porch
was
blissfully
unconscious
of
the
disapproving
eyes
i
wish
one
of
us
had
just
stopped
to
call
good
morning
to
her
over
the
fence
and
to
say
in
our
neighbourly
small
town
way
my
ai
this
a
scorcher
so
early
too
it
be
fierce
by
noon
but
we
did
not
i
think
perhaps
the
evenings
must
have
been
the
loneliest
for
her
the
summer
evenings
in
our
little
town
are
filled
with
intimate
human
neighbourly
sounds
after
the
heat
of
the
day
it
is
infinitely
pleasant
to
relax
in
the
cool
comfort
of
the
front
porch
with
the
life
of
the
town
eddying
about
us
we
sew
and
read
out
there
until
it
grows
dusk
we
call
to
our
neighbour
the
men
water
the
lawns
and
the
flower
boxes
and
get
together
in
little
quiet
groups
to
discuss
the
new
street
paving
i
have
even
known
hines
to
bring
her
cherries
out
there
when
she
had
canning
to
do
and
pit
them
there
on
the
front
porch
partially
shielded
by
her
porch
vine
but
not
so
effectually
that
she
was
deprived
of
the
sights
and
sounds
about
her
the
kettle
in
her
lap
and
the
dishpan
full
of
great
ripe
cherries
on
the
porch
floor
by
her
chair
she
would
pit
and
chat
and
peer
out
through
the
vines
the
red
juice
staining
her
plump
bare
arms
i
have
wondered
since
what
blanche
devine
thought
of
us
those
lonesome
evenings
those
evenings
filled
with
little
friendly
sights
and
sounds
it
is
lonely
uphill
business
at
best
this
being
good
it
must
have
been
difficult
for
her
who
had
dwelt
behind
closed
shutters
so
long
to
seat
herself
on
the
new
front
porch
for
all
the
world
to
stare
at
but
she
did
sit
there
resolutely
watching
us
in
silence
she
seized
hungrily
upon
the
stray
crumbs
of
conversation
that
fell
to
her
the
milkman
and
the
iceman
and
the
butcher
boy
used
to
hold
daily
conversation
with
her
they
sociable
gentlemen
would
stand
on
her
doorstep
one
grimy
hand
resting
against
the
white
of
her
doorpost
exchanging
the
time
of
day
with
blanche
in
the
doorway
a
tea
towel
in
one
hand
perhaps
and
a
plate
in
the
other
her
little
house
was
a
miracle
of
cleanliness
it
was
no
uncommon
sight
to
see
her
down
on
her
knees
on
the
kitchen
floor
wielding
her
brush
and
rag
like
the
rest
of
us
in
canning
and
preserving
time
there
floated
out
from
her
kitchen
the
pungent
scent
of
pickled
crab
apples
the
smell
that
meant
sweet
pickles
or
the
cloying
tantalising
divinely
sticky
odour
that
meant
raspberry
jam
snooky
from
her
side
of
the
fence
often
used
to
peer
through
the
pickets
gazing
in
the
direction
of
the
enticing
smells
next
door
early
one
september
morning
there
floated
out
from
blanche
devine
kitchen
that
clean
fragrant
sweet
scent
of
cookies
cookies
with
butter
in
them
and
spice
and
with
nuts
on
top
just
by
the
smell
of
them
your
mind
eye
pictured
them
coming
from
the
oven
crisp
brown
circlets
crumbly
toothsome
delectable
snooky
in
her
scarlet
sweater
and
cap
sniffed
them
from
afar
and
straightway
deserted
her
sandpile
to
take
her
stand
at
the
fence
she
peered
through
the
restraining
bars
standing
on
tiptoe
blanche
devine
glancing
up
from
her
board
and
saw
the
eager
golden
head
and
snooky
with
guile
in
her
heart
raised
one
fat
dimpled
hand
above
the
fence
and
waved
it
friendlily
blanche
devine
waved
back
thus
encouraged
snooky
two
hands
wigwagged
frantically
above
the
pickets
blanche
devine
hesitated
a
moment
her
floury
hand
on
her
hip
then
she
went
to
the
pantry
shelf
and
took
out
a
clean
white
saucer
she
selected
from
the
brown
jar
on
the
table
three
of
the
brownest
crumbliest
most
perfect
cookies
with
a
walnut
meat
perched
atop
of
each
placed
them
temptingly
on
the
saucer
and
descending
the
steps
came
swiftly
across
the
grass
to
the
triumphant
snooky
blanche
devine
held
out
the
saucer
her
lips
smiling
her
eyes
tender
snooky
reached
up
with
one
plump
white
arm
snooky
shrilled
a
high
voice
snooky
a
voice
of
horror
and
of
wrath
come
here
to
me
this
minute
and
do
you
dare
to
touch
those
snooky
hesitated
rebelliously
one
pink
finger
in
her
pouting
mouth
snooky
do
you
hear
me
and
the
very
young
wife
began
to
descend
the
steps
of
her
back
porch
snooky
regretful
eyes
on
the
toothsome
dainties
turned
away
aggrieved
the
very
young
wife
her
lips
set
her
eyes
flashing
advanced
and
seized
the
shrieking
snooky
by
one
writhing
arm
and
dragged
her
away
toward
home
and
safety
blanche
devine
stood
there
at
the
fence
holding
the
saucer
in
her
hand
the
saucer
tipped
slowly
and
the
three
cookies
slipped
off
and
fell
to
the
grass
blanche
devine
followed
them
with
her
eyes
and
stood
staring
at
them
a
moment
then
she
turned
quickly
went
into
the
house
and
shut
the
door
it
was
about
this
time
we
noticed
that
blanche
devine
was
away
much
of
the
time
the
little
white
cottage
would
be
empty
for
a
week
we
knew
she
was
out
of
town
because
the
expressman
would
come
for
her
trunk
we
used
to
lift
our
eyebrows
significantly
the
newspapers
and
handbills
would
accumulate
in
a
dusty
little
heap
on
the
porch
but
when
she
returned
there
was
always
a
grand
cleaning
with
the
windows
open
and
blanche
her
head
bound
turbanwise
in
a
towel
appearing
at
a
window
every
few
minutes
to
shake
out
a
dustcloth
she
seemed
to
put
an
enormous
amount
of
energy
into
those
cleanings
as
if
they
were
a
sort
of
safety
valve
as
winter
came
on
she
used
to
sit
up
before
her
grate
fire
long
long
after
we
were
asleep
in
our
beds
when
she
neglected
to
pull
down
the
shades
we
could
see
the
flames
of
her
cosy
fire
dancing
gnomelike
on
the
wall
there
came
a
night
of
sleet
and
snow
and
wind
and
rattling
hail
one
of
those
blustering
wild
nights
that
are
followed
by
reports
of
trains
stalled
in
drifts
mail
delayed
telephone
and
telegraph
wires
down
it
must
have
been
midnight
or
past
when
there
came
a
hammering
at
blanche
devine
door
a
persistent
clamorous
rapping
blanche
devine
sitting
before
her
dying
fire
half
asleep
started
and
cringed
when
she
heard
it
then
jumped
to
her
feet
her
hand
at
her
breast
her
eyes
darting
this
way
and
that
as
though
seeking
escape
she
had
heard
a
rapping
like
that
before
it
had
meant
bluecoats
swarming
up
the
stairway
and
frightened
cries
and
pleadings
and
wild
confusion
so
she
started
forward
now
quivering
and
then
she
remembered
being
wholly
awake
now
she
remembered
and
threw
up
her
head
and
smiled
a
little
bitterly
and
walked
toward
the
door
the
hammering
continued
louder
than
ever
blanche
devine
flicked
on
the
porch
light
and
opened
the
door
the
figure
of
the
very
young
wife
next
door
staggered
into
the
room
she
seized
blanche
devine
arm
with
both
her
frenzied
hands
and
shook
her
the
wind
and
snow
beating
in
upon
both
of
them
the
baby
she
screamed
in
a
high
hysterical
voice
the
baby
the
baby
blanche
devine
shut
the
door
and
shook
the
young
wife
smartly
by
the
shoulders
stop
screaming
she
said
quietly
is
she
sick
the
young
wife
told
her
her
teeth
chattering
come
quick
she
dying
will
out
of
town
i
tried
to
get
the
doctor
the
telephone
would
i
saw
your
light
for
god
sake
blanche
devine
grasped
the
young
wife
arm
opened
the
door
and
together
they
sped
across
the
little
space
that
separated
the
two
houses
blanche
devine
was
a
big
woman
but
she
took
the
stairs
like
a
girl
and
found
the
right
bedroom
by
some
miraculous
woman
instinct
a
dreadful
choking
rattling
sound
was
coming
from
snooky
bed
croup
said
blanche
devine
and
began
her
fight
it
was
a
good
fight
she
marshalled
her
little
inadequate
forces
made
up
of
the
young
wife
and
the
terrified
and
awkward
hired
girl
get
the
hot
water
on
lots
of
it
blanche
devine
pinned
up
her
sleeves
hot
cloths
tear
up
a
sheet
or
anything
got
an
oilstove
i
want
a
teakettle
boiling
in
the
room
she
got
to
have
the
steam
if
that
do
do
it
we
raise
an
umbrella
over
her
and
throw
a
sheet
over
and
hold
the
kettle
under
till
the
steam
gets
to
her
that
way
got
any
ipecac
the
young
wife
obeyed
orders
whitefaced
and
shaking
once
blanche
devine
glanced
up
at
her
sharply
do
you
dare
faint
she
commanded
and
the
fight
went
on
gradually
the
breathing
that
had
been
so
frightful
became
softer
easier
blanche
devine
did
not
relax
it
was
not
until
the
little
figure
breathed
gently
in
sleep
that
blanche
devine
sat
back
satisfied
then
she
tucked
a
cover
ever
so
gently
at
the
side
of
the
bed
took
a
last
satisfied
look
at
the
face
on
the
pillow
and
turned
to
look
at
the
wan
dishevelled
young
wife
she
all
right
now
we
can
get
the
doctor
when
morning
comes
though
i
do
know
you
need
him
the
young
wife
came
round
to
blanche
devine
side
of
the
bed
and
stood
looking
up
at
her
my
baby
died
said
blanche
devine
simply
the
young
wife
gave
a
little
inarticulate
cry
put
her
two
hands
on
blanche
devine
broad
shoulders
and
laid
her
tired
head
on
her
breast
i
guess
i
better
be
going
said
blanche
devine
the
young
wife
raised
her
head
her
eyes
were
round
with
fright
going
oh
please
stay
i
so
afraid
suppose
she
should
take
sick
again
that
awful
awful
breathing
i
stay
if
you
want
me
to
oh
please
i
make
up
your
bed
and
you
can
rest
i
not
sleepy
i
not
much
of
a
hand
to
sleep
anyway
i
sit
up
here
in
the
hall
where
there
a
light
you
get
to
bed
i
watch
and
see
that
everything
all
right
have
you
got
something
i
can
read
out
here
something
kind
of
lively
with
a
love
story
in
it
so
the
night
went
by
snooky
slept
in
her
little
white
bed
the
very
young
wife
half
dozed
in
her
bed
so
near
the
little
one
in
the
hall
her
stout
figure
looming
grotesque
in
sat
blanche
devine
pretending
to
read
now
and
then
she
rose
and
tiptoed
into
the
bedroom
with
miraculous
quiet
and
stooped
over
the
little
bed
and
listened
and
looked
and
tiptoed
away
again
satisfied
the
young
husband
came
home
from
his
business
trip
next
day
with
tales
of
snowdrifts
and
stalled
engines
blanche
devine
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
when
she
saw
him
from
her
kitchen
window
she
watched
the
house
now
with
a
sort
of
proprietary
eye
she
wondered
about
snooky
but
she
knew
better
than
to
ask
so
she
waited
the
young
wife
next
door
had
told
her
husband
all
about
that
awful
night
had
told
him
with
tears
and
sobs
the
very
young
husband
had
been
very
very
angry
with
her
angry
and
hurt
he
said
and
astonished
snooky
could
not
have
been
so
sick
look
at
her
now
as
well
as
ever
and
to
have
called
such
a
woman
well
really
he
did
not
want
to
be
harsh
but
she
must
understand
that
she
must
never
speak
to
the
woman
again
never
so
the
next
day
the
very
young
wife
happened
to
go
by
with
the
young
husband
blanche
devine
spied
them
from
her
window
and
she
made
the
excuse
of
looking
in
her
mailbox
in
order
to
go
to
the
door
she
stood
in
the
doorway
and
the
very
young
wife
went
by
on
the
arm
of
her
husband
she
went
by
rather
without
a
look
or
a
word
or
a
sign
and
then
this
happened
there
came
into
blanche
devine
face
a
look
that
made
slits
of
her
eyes
and
drew
her
mouth
down
into
an
ugly
narrow
line
and
that
made
the
muscles
of
her
jaw
tense
and
hard
it
was
the
ugliest
look
you
can
imagine
then
she
smiled
if
having
one
lips
curl
away
from
one
teeth
can
be
called
smiling
two
days
later
there
was
great
news
of
the
white
cottage
on
the
corner
the
curtains
were
down
the
furniture
was
packed
the
rugs
were
rolled
the
wagons
came
and
backed
up
to
the
house
and
took
those
things
that
had
made
a
home
for
blanche
devine
and
when
we
heard
that
she
had
bought
back
her
interest
in
the
house
with
the
closed
shutters
near
the
freight
depot
we
sniffed
i
knew
she
would
last
we
said
they
never
do
said
we
vii
the
girl
who
went
right
there
is
a
story
kipling
i
think
that
tells
of
a
spirited
horse
galloping
in
the
dark
suddenly
drawing
up
tense
hoofs
bunched
slim
flanks
quivering
nostrils
dilated
ears
pricked
urging
being
of
no
avail
the
rider
dismounts
strikes
a
match
advances
a
cautious
step
or
so
and
finds
himself
at
the
precipitous
brink
of
a
newly
formed
crevasse
so
it
is
with
your
trained
editor
a
miraculous
sixth
sense
guides
him
a
mysterious
something
warns
him
of
danger
lurking
within
the
seemingly
innocent
oblong
white
envelope
without
slitting
the
flap
without
pausing
to
adjust
his
glasses
without
clearing
his

without

the
story
she
had
been
sitting
before
the
fire
for
a
long
long
time
the
flame
had
flickered
and
died
down
to
a
smouldering
ash
the
sound
of
his
departing
footsteps
echoed
and
through
her
brain
but
the
little
room
was
very
very
still
the
story
torn
boots
and
temptation
tears
and
snears
pathos
and
bathos
all
the
way
from

to
the
vice
inquiry
having
thus
attempted
to
hide
the
deadly
commonplaceness
of
this
story
with
a
thin
layer
of
cynicism
perhaps
even
the
wily
editor
may
be
tricked
into
taking
the
leap
four
weeks
before
the
completion
of
the
new
addition
the
store
advertised
for
two
hundred
experienced
saleswomen
rachel
wiletzky
entering
the
superintendent
office
after
a
wait
of
three
hours
was
applicant
no
the
superintendent
did
not
look
up
as
rachel
came
in
he
scribbled
busily
on
a
pad
of
paper
at
his
desk
thus
observing
rules
one
and
two
in
the
proper
conduct
of
superintendents
when
interviewing
applicants
rachel
wiletzky
standing
by
his
desk
did
not
cough
or
wriggle
or
rustle
her
skirts
or
sag
on
one
hip
a
sense
of
her
quiet
penetrated
the
superintendent
subconsciousness
he
glanced
up
hurriedly
over
his
left
shoulder
then
he
laid
down
his
pencil
and
sat
up
slowly
his
mind
was
working
quickly
enough
though
in
the
twelve
seconds
that
intervened
between
the
laying
down
of
the
pencil
and
the
sitting
up
in
his
chair
he
had
hastily
readjusted
all
his
preconceived
ideas
on
the
appearance
of
applicants
rachel
wiletzky
had
the
colouring
and
physique
of
a
dairymaid
it
was
the
sort
of
colouring
that
you
associate
in
your
mind
with
lush
green
fields
and
jersey
cows
and
village
maids
in
watteau
frocks
balancing
brimming
pails
aloft
in
the
protecting
curve
of
one
rounded
upraised
arm
with
perhaps
a
maypole
dance
or
so
in
the
background
altogether
had
the
superintendent
been
given
to
figures
of
speech
he
might
have
said
that
rachel
was
as
much
out
of
place
among
the
preceding
one
hundred
and
bloodless
applicants
as
a
sunflower
would
be
in
a
patch
of
dank
white
fungi
he
himself
was
one
of
those
bleached
men
that
you
find
on
the
office
floor
of
department
stores
grey
skin
grey
eyes
greying
hair
careful
grey
clothes
seemingly
as
void
of
pigment
as
one
of
those
sunless
things
you
disclose
when
you
turn
over
a
board
that
has
long
lain
on
the
mouldy
floor
of
a
damp
cellar
it
was
only
when
you
looked
closely
that
you
noticed
a
fleck
of
golden
brown
in
the
cold
grey
of
each
eye
and
a
streak
of
warm
brown
forming
an
unquenchable
forelock
that
the
conquering
grey
had
not
been
able
to
vanquish
it
may
have
been
a
something
within
him
corresponding
to
those
outward
bits
of
human
colouring
that
tempted
him
to
yield
to
a
queer
impulse
he
whipped
from
his
the
handkerchief
reached
up
swiftly
and
passed
one
white
corner
of
it
down
the
length
of
rachel
left
cheek
the
rude
path
down
which
the
handkerchief
had
travelled
deepened
to
red
for
a
moment
before
both
cheeks
bloomed
into
scarlet
the
superintendent
gazed
rather
ruefully
from
unblemished
handkerchief
to
cheek
and
back
again
why
it
it
real
he
stammered
rachel
wiletzky
smiled
a
little
smile
that
had
in
it
a
dash
of
superiority
if
i
was
putting
it
on
she
said
i
hope
i
have
sense
enough
to
leave
something
to
the
imagination
this
colour
out
of
a
box
would
take
a
spiderweb
veil
to
tone
it
down
not
much
more
than
a
score
of
words
and
yet
before
the
half
were
spoken
you
were
certain
that
rachel
wiletzky
knowledge
of
lush
green
fields
and
bucolic
scenes
was
that
gleaned
from
the
ads
that
glare
down
at
one
from
billboards
and
chromos
hers
was
the
ghetto
voice
harsh
metallic
yet
fraught
with
the
resonant
music
of
tragedy
h
name
asked
the
grey
superintendent
he
knew
that
vocal
quality
a
queer
look
stole
into
rachel
wiletzky
face
a
look
of
cunning
and
determination
and
shrewdness
ray
willets
she
replied
composedly
double
clerked
before
of
course
our

hastily
eagerly
i

tired

know
why
but

the
superintendent
glanced
up
again
at
the
red
that
glowed
higher
with
the
girl
suppressed
excitement
he
took
a
printed
slip
from
the
little
pile
of
paper
that
lay
on
his
desk
well
anyway
you
the
first
clerk
i
ever
saw
who
had
so
much
red
blood
that
she
could
afford
to
use
it
for
decorative
purposes
step
into
the
next
room
answer
the
questions
on
this
card
and
turn
it
in

ray
willets
took
the
searching
telltale
blank
that
put
its
questions
so
pertinently
where
last
employed
it
demanded
why
did
you
leave
do
you
live
at
home
ray
willets
moved
slowly
away
toward
the
door
opposite
the
superintendent
reached
forward
to
press
the
button
that
would
summon
applicant
no
but
before
his
finger
touched
it
ray
willets
turned
and
came
back
swiftly
she
held
the
card
out
before
his
surprised
eyes
i
ca
fill
this
out
if
i
do
i
wo
get
the
job
i
work
over
at
the
halsted

the
cheap

lied
and
sent

was
sick
so
i
could
come
over
here
this
morning
and
they
dock
you
for
time
off
whether
you
sick
or
not
the
superintendent
drummed
impatiently
with
his
fingers
i
ca
listen
to
all
this
have
time
fill
out
your
blank
and
if
all
that
latent
dramatic
force
which
is
a
heritage
of
her
race
came
to
the
girl
aid
now
the
blank
how
can
i
say
on
a
blank

leaving
because
i
want
to
be
where
real

are

why
but
i

at
my
face
where
should
i
get
red
cheeks
from
from
not
having
enough
to
eat
half
the
time
and
sleeping
three
in
a
bed
she
snatched
off
her
shabby
glove
and
held
one
hand
out
before
the
face
from
where
do
i
get
such
hands
not
from
selling
hardware
over
at
twelfth
and
halsted
look
at
it
say
could
that
hand
sell
silk
and
lace
some
one
has
said
that
to
make
fingers
and
wrists
like
those
which
ray
willets
held
out
for
inspection
it
is
necessary
to
have
had
at
least
five
generations
of
ancestors
who
have
sat
with
their
hands
folded
in
their
laps
slender
tapering
sensitive
hands
they
were
temperamental
wistful
hands
they
were
speaking
hands
an
inheritance
perhaps
from
some
dreamer
ancestor
within
the
ghetto
some
student
of
the
talmud
dwelling
within
the
pale
with
its
squalor
and
noise
and
dreaming
of
unseen
things
beyond
the
confining
gates
things
rare
and
exquisite
and
fine
ashamed
of
your
folks
snapped
the
superintendent
no

i
want
to
be
different
i
am
different
give
me
a
chance
will

straight

work

that
greyness
seemed
to
have
lifted
from
the
man
at
the
desk
the
brown
flecks
in
the
eyes
seemed
to
spread
and
engulf
the
surrounding
colourlessness
his
face
too
took
on
a
glow
that
seemed
to
come
from
within
it
was
like
the
lifting
of
a
thick
grey
mist
on
a
foggy
morning
so
that
the
sun
shines
bright
and
clear
for
a
brief
moment
before
the

rolls
down

passed
out
at
the
door
opposite
the
one
through
which
rachel
wiletzky
had
entered
some
one
in
the
department
her
chubbs
before
she
had
spent
half
a
day
in
the
underwear
and
imported
lingerie
at
the
store
school
she
listened
and
learned
she
learned
how
important
were
things
of
which
halsted
street
took
no
cognisance
she
learned
to
make
out
a
sale
slip
as
complicated
as
an
engineering
blueprint
she
learned
that
a
clerk
must
develop
suavity
and
patience
in
the
same
degree
as
a
customer
waxes
waspish
and
insulting
and
that
the
spectrum
colours
do
not
exist
in
the
costume
of
the
for
her
there
are
only
black
and
white
these
things
she
learned
and
many
more
and
remembered
them
for
behind
the
rosy
cheeks
and
the
eyes
burned
the
indomitable
desire
to
get
on
and
the
finished
embodiment
of
all
of
ray
willets
desires
and
ambitions
was
daily
before
her
eyes
in
the
presence
of
miss
jevne
head
of
the
lingerie
and
neglig√©es
of
miss
jevne
it
might
be
said
that
she
was
real
where
ray
was
artificial
and
artificial
where
ray
was
real
everything
that
miss
jevne
wore
was
real
she
was
as
modish
as
ray
was
shabby
as
slim
as
ray
was
stocky
as
artificially
tinted
and
tinctured
as
ray
was
naturally
and
buxom
it
takes
real
money
to
buy
clothes
as
real
as
those
worn
by
miss
jevne
the
soft
charmeuse
in
her
graceful
gown
was
real
and
miraculously
draped
the
collar
that
so
delicately
traced
its
pattern
against
the
black
background
of
her
gown
was
real
so
was
the
ripple
of
lace
that
cascaded
down
the
front
of
her
blouse
the
straight
correct
hideously
modern
lines
of
her
figure
bespoke
a
real
corset
realest
of
all
there
reposed
on
miss
bosom
a
bar
pin
of
platinum
and
diamonds
very
real
diamonds
set
in
a
severely
plain
but
very
real
bar
of
precious
platinum
so
if
you
except
miss
jevne
changeless
colour
her
artificial
smile
her
glittering
hair
and
her
undulating
walk
you
can
see
that
everything
about
miss
jevne
was
as
real
as
money
can
make
one
miss
jevne
when
she
deigned
to
notice
ray
willets
at
all
called
her
girl
thus
girl
get
down
one
of
those
number
seventeens
for
me
with
the
pink
ribbons
ray
did
not
resent
the
tone
she
thought
about
miss
jevne
as
she
worked
she
thought
about
her
at
night
when
she
was
washing
and
ironing
her
other
shirtwaist
for
next
day
wear
in
the
halsted
street
bazaar
the
girls
had
been
on
terms
of
dreadful
intimacy
with
those
affairs
in
each
other
lives
which
popularly
are
supposed
to
be
private
knowledge
they
knew
the
sum
which
each
earned
per
week
how
much
they
turned
in
to
help
swell
the
family
coffers
and
how
much
they
were
allowed
to
keep
for
their
own
use
they
knew
each
time
a
girl
spent
a
quarter
for
a
cheap
sailor
collar
or
a
pair
of
stockings
ray
willets
who
wanted
passionately
to
be
different
whose
hands
so
loved
the
touch
of
the
lacy
silky
garments
that
made
up
the
lingerie
and
negligee
departments
recognised
the
perfection
of
miss
faultless
realness
recognised
it
appreciated
it
envied
it
it
worried
her
too
how
did
she
do
it
how
did
one
go
about
attaining
the
same
degree
of
realness
meanwhile
she
worked
she
learned
quickly
she
took
care
always
to
be
cheerful
interested
polite
after
a
short
week
handling
of
lacy
silken
garments
she
ceased
to
feel
a
shock
when
she
saw
miss
jevne
displaying
a
made
up
of
white
cloud
and
and
languidly
assuring
the
customer
that
of
course
it
was
to
be
expected
that
you
could
get
a
fine
handmade
lace
at
that
price
only
now
if
she
cared
to
look
at
something
really
fine
made
entirely
by
hand
why
the
end
of
the
first
ten
days
found
so
much
knowledge
crammed
into
ray
willets
clever
ambitious
little
head
that
the
pink
of
her
cheeks
had
deepened
to
carmine
as
a
child
grows
flushed
and
too
when
overstimulated
and
overtired
miss
myrtle
the
store
beauty
strolled
up
to
ray
who
was
straightening
a
pile
of
corset
covers
and
miss
myrtle
was
the
star
model
tall
svelte
graceful
lovely
in
line
and
contour
she
was
remarkably
like
one
of
those
exquisite
imbeciles
that
rossetti
used
to
love
to
paint
hers
were
the
great
cowlike
eyes
the
wonderful
oval
face
the
marvellous
little
nose
the
perfect
lips
and
chin
miss
myrtle
could
don
a
gown
parade
it
before
a
possible
purchaser
and
make
it
look
like
an
imported
model
at
one
hundred
and
when
miss
myrtle
opened
those
exquisite
lips
and
spoke
you
got
a
shock
that
hurt
she
laid
one
cool
slim
finger
on
ray
ruddy
cheek
sure
enough
she
drawled
nasally
whereja
get
it
anyway
kid
you
must
of
been
brought
up
on
peaches
cream
and
slept
in
a
pink
cloud
somewheres
me
laughed
ray
her
deft
fingers
busy
straightening
a
bow
here
a
ruffle
of
lace
there
me
the
runs
so
near
my
bed
that
if
it
was
ever
to
get
a
notion
to
take
a
short
cut
it
would
slice
off
my
legs
to
the
knees
live
at
home
miss
myrtle
grasshopper
mind
never
dwelt
long
on
one
subject
well
sure
replied
ray
did
you
think
i
had
a
flat
up
on
the
drive
i
live
at
home
too
miss
myrtle
announced
impressively
she
was
leaning
indolently
against
the
table
her
eyes
followed
the
deft
quick
movements
of
ray
slender
capable
hands
miss
myrtle
always
leaned
when
there
was
anything
to
lean
on
involuntarily
she
fell
into
melting
poses
one
shoulder
always
drooped
slightly
one
toe
always
trailed
a
bit
like
the
picture
on
the
cover
of
the
fashion
magazines
one
hand
and
arm
always
followed
the
line
of
her
draperies
while
the
other
was
raised
to
hip
or
breast
or
head
ray
busy
hands
paused
a
moment
she
looked
up
at
the
picturesque
myrtle
all
the
girls
do
do
they
huh
said
myrtle
blankly
live
at
home
i
mean
the
application
blank
says
say
you
got
clever
hands
ai
you
put
in
miss
myrtle
irrelevantly
she
looked
ruefully
at
her
own
short
stubby
unintelligent
hands
that
so
perfectly
reflected
her
character
in
that
marvellous
way
hands
have
mine
are
i
bet
you
get
on
she
sagged
to
the
other
hip
with
a
weary
gracefulness
i
got
no
brains
she
complained
where
do
they
live
then
persisted
ray
who
oh
i
live
at
home
again
virtuously
but
i
got
some
heart
if
i
am
dumb
my
folks
could
get
along
without
what
i
bring
home
every
week
a
lot
of
the
girls
have
flats
but
that
do
last
now
jevne
yes
said
ray
eagerly
her
plump
face
with
its
intelligent
eyes
was
all
aglow
miss
myrtle
lowered
her
voice
discreetly
her
own
folks
do
know
where
she
lives
they
says
she
sends
money
every
month
but
with
the
understanding
that
they
do
try
to
come
to
see
her
they
live
way
over
on
the
west
side
somewhere
she
makes
her
buying
trip
to
europe
every
year
speaks
french
and
everything
they
say
when
she
started
to
earn
real
money
she
just
cut
loose
from
her
folks
they
was
a
drag
on
her
and
she
wanted
to
get
to
the
top
say
that
pin
real
ai
it
real
well
i
should
say
it
is
catch
jevne
wearing
anything
phony
i
saw
her
at
the
theatre
one
night
dressed
well
you
have
thought
that
birds
of
paradise
were
national
pests
like
english
sparrows
not
that
she
looked
loud
but
that
quiet
rich
elegance
you
know
that
just
smells
of
money
say
but
i
bet
she
has
her
lonesome
evenings
ray
willets
eyes
darted
across
the
long
room
and
rested
upon
the
shining
figure
of
miss
jevne
moving
about
against
the
luxurious
background
of
the
french
room
she
she
left
her
folks
h
she
mused
aloud
miss
myrtle
the
brainless
regarded
the
tips
of
her
shabby
boots
what
did
it
get
her
she
asked
as
though
to
herself
i
know
what
it
does
to
a
girl
seeing
and
handling
stuff
that
made
for
millionaires
you
get
a
taste
for
it
yourself
take
it
from
me
it
ai
the
girl
that
needs
looking
after
she
taking
her
little
pay
envelope
home
to
her
mother
that
a
widow
and
it
goes
to
buy
milk
for
the
kids
sometimes
i
think
the
more
you
get
the
more
you
want
somebody
ought
to
turn
that
vice
inquiry
on
to
the
tracks
of
that
girl
in
the
irish
crochet
waist
and
the
diamond
bar
pin
she
make
swell
readin
there
fell
a
little
silence
between
the
two
a
silence
of
which
neither
was
conscious
both
were
thinking
myrtle
disjointedly
purposelessly
all
unconscious
that
her
slow
untrained
mind
had
groped
for
a
great
and
vital
truth
and
found
it
ray
quickly
eagerly
connectedly
a
new
and
daring
resolve
growing
with
lightning
rapidity
there
another
new
baby
at
our
house
she
said
aloud
suddenly
it
cries
all
night
pretty
near
ai
they
fierce
laughed
myrtle
and
yet
i
dunno
she
fell
silent
again
then
with
the
with
which
we
waken
from
day
dreams
she
moved
away
in
response
to
the
beckoning
finger
of
a
saleswoman
in
the
section
ten
minutes
later
her
exquisite
face
rose
above
the
soft
folds
of
a
black
charmeuse
coat
that
rippled
away
from
her
slender
supple
body
in
lines
that
a
sculptor
dreams
of
and
never
achieves
ray
willets
finished
straightening
her
counter
trade
was
slow
she
moved
idly
in
the
direction
of
the
figure
that
flitted
about
in
the
costly
atmosphere
of
the
french
section
it
must
be
a
very
special
customer
to
claim
miss
jevne
expert
services
ray
glanced
in
through
the
glass
and
doors
here
girl
called
miss
jevne
ray
paused
and
entered
miss
jevne
was
frowning
miss
myrtle
busy
just
slip
this
on
careful
now
keep
your
arms
close
to
your
head
she
slipped
a
marvellously
wrought
garment
over
ray
sleek
head
fluffy
drifts
of
equally
exquisite
lingerie
lay
scattered
about
on
chairs
over
mirrors
across
showtables
on
one
of
the
fragile
little
chairs
in
the
centre
of
the
costly
little
room
sat
a
large
blonde
perfumed
woman
who
clanked
and
rustled
and
swished
as
she
moved
her
eyes
were
and
heavy
but
strangely
bright
one
ungloved
hand
was
very
white
too
but
pudgy
and
covered
so
thickly
with
gems
that
your
eye
could
get
no
clear
picture
of
any
single
stone
or
setting
ray
clad
in
the
diaphanous
folds
of
the
that
was
so
beautifully
adorned
with
delicate
embroideries
wrought
by
the
patient
fingers
of
some
silent
nun
in
a
convent
paced
slowly
up
and
down
the
short
length
of
the
room
that
the
critical
eye
of
this
coarse
unlettered
creature
might
behold
the
wonders
woven
by
this
weary
french
nun
and
beholding
approve
it
ai
bad
spake
the
blonde
woman
grudgingly
how
much
did
you
say
miss
jevne
made
answer
smoothly
i
selected
it
myself
when
i
was
in
france
my
last
trip
a
bargain
she
slid
the
robe
carefully
over
ray
head
the
frown
came
once
more
to
her
brow
she
bent
close
to
ray
ear
your
waist
ripped
under
the
left
arm
disgraceful
the
blonde
woman
moved
and
jangled
a
bit
in
her
chair
well
i
take
it
she
sighed
look
at
the
colour
on
that
girl
and
it
real
too
she
rose
heavily
and
came
over
to
ray
reached
up
and
pinched
her
cheek
appraisingly
with
perfumed
white
thumb
and
forefinger
that
do
girl
said
miss
jevne
sweetly
take
this
along
and
change
these
ribbons
from
blue
to
pink
ray
willets
bore
the
fairy
garment
away
with
her
she
bore
it
tenderly
almost
reverently
it
was
more
than
a
garment
it
represented
in
her
mind
a
new
standard
of
all
that
was
beautiful
and
exquisite
and
desirable
ten
days
before
the
formal
opening
of
the
new
addition
there
was
issued
from
the
superintendent
office
an
order
that
made
a
little
flurry
among
the
clerks
in
the
sections
devoted
to
women
dress
the
new
store
when
thrown
open
would
mark
an
epoch
in
the
retail
drygoods
business
of
the
city
the
order
began
thousands
were
to
be
spent
on
perishable
decorations
alone
the
highest
type
of
patronage
was
to
be
catered
to
therefore
the
women
in
the
lingerie
neglig√©e
millinery
dress
suit
and
corset
sections
were
requested
to
wear
during
opening
week
a
modest
but
modish
black
gown
that
would
blend
with
the
air
of
elegance
which
those
departments
were
to
maintain
ray
willets
of
the
lingerie
and
neglig√©e
sections
read
her
order
slip
slowly
then
she
reread
it
then
she
did
a
mental
sum
in
simple
arithmetic
a
childish
sum
it
was
and
yet
before
she
got
her
answer
the
solving
of
it
had
stamped
on
her
face
a
certain
hard
set
resolute
look
the
store
management
had
chosen
wednesday
to
be
the
opening
day
by
wednesday
morning
the
french
lingerie
millinery
and
dress
sections
with
their
women
clerks
garbed
in
modest
but
modish
black
gowns
looked
like
a
levee
at
buckingham
when
the
court
is
in
mourning
but
the
grouped
about
here
and
there
fell
back
in
respectful
silence
when
there
paced
down
the
aisle
the
queen
royal
in
the
person
of
miss
jevne
there
is
a
certain
sort
of
black
gown
that
is
more
startling
and
daring
than
scarlet
miss
was
that
style
fast
black
you
might
term
it
miss
jevne
was
aware
of
the
flurry
and
flutter
that
followed
her
majestic
progress
down
the
aisle
to
her
own
section
she
knew
that
each
eye
was
caught
in
the
tip
of
the
little
train
that
slipped
and
slunk
and
wriggled
along
the
ground
thence
up
to
the
soft
drapery
caught
so
cunningly
just
below
the
knee
up
higher
to
the
marvelously
simple
sash
that
swayed
with
each
step
to
the
soft
folds
of
black
against
which
rested
the
very
real
diamond
and
platinum
bar
pin
up
to
the
lace
at
her
throat
and
then
stopping
blinking
and
staring
again
gazed
fixedly
at
the
string
of
pearls
that
lay
about
her
throat
pearls
rosily
pink
mistily
grey
an
aura
of
enveloping
her
miss
jevne
disappeared
behind
the
portals
of
the
new
french
section
and
there
the
aura
vanished
quivering
for
standing
before
one
of
the
cases
and
patting
into
place
with
deft
fingers
the
satin
bow
of
a
chemise
was
ray
willets
in
her
shiny
little
black
serge
skirt
and
the
braver
of
her
two
white
shirtwaists
miss
jevne
quickened
her
pace
ray
turned
her
bright
brown
eyes
grew
brighter
at
sight
of
miss
jevne
wondrous
black
miss
jevne
her
train
wound
round
her
feet
like
an
actress
photograph
lifted
her
eyebrows
to
an
unbelievable
height
explain
that
costume
she
said
costume
repeated
ray
fencing
miss
jevne
thin
lips
grew
thinner
you
understood
that
women
in
this
department
were
to
wear
black
gowns
this
week
ray
smiled
a
little
twisted
smile
yes
i
understood
then
what
ray
little
smile
grew
a
trifle
more
i
had
the
money
last
week
i
was
going
to
the
baby
took
sick
the
heat
i
guess
coming
so
sudden
we
had
the
doctor
and
medicine
i
say
your
own
folks
come
before
black
dresses
miss
jevne
cold
eyes
saw
the
careful
patch
under
ray
left
arm
where
a
few
days
before
the
torn
place
had
won
her
a
reproof
it
was
the
last
straw
you
ca
stay
in
this
department
in
that
rig
who
says
so
snapped
ray
with
a
flash
of
halsted
street
bravado
if
my
customers
want
a
peek
at
paquin
i
send
to
you
i
show
you
who
says
so
retorted
miss
jevne
quite
losing
sight
of
the
queen
business
the
stately
form
of
the
floor
manager
was
visible
among
the
glass
showcases
beyond
miss
jevne
sought
him
agitatedly
all
the
little
sagging
lines
about
her
mouth
showed
up
sharply
defying
years
of
careful
massage
the
floor
manager
bent
his
stately
head
and
listened
then
led
by
miss
jevne
he
approached
ray
willets
whose
deft
fingers
trembling
a
very
little
now
were
still
pretending
to
adjust
the
perfect
bow
the
manager
touched
her
on
the
arm
not
unkindly
report
for
work
in
the
kitchen
utensils
fifth
floor
he
said
then
at
sight
of
the
face
we
ca
have
one
disobeying
orders
you
know
the
rest
of
the
clerks
would
raise
a
row
in
no
time
down
in
the
kitchen
utensils
and
household
goods
there
was
no
rule
demanding
modest
but
modish
gowns
in
the
kitchenware
one
could
don
black
sateen
sleevelets
to
protect
one
clean
white
waist
without
breaking
the
department
tenets
of
fashion
you
could
even
pin
a
handkerchief
across
the
front
of
your
waist
if
your
job
was
that
of
dusting
the
granite
ware
at
first
ray
delicate
fingers
accustomed
to
the
touch
of
soft
sheer
white
stuff
and
ribbon
and
lace
and
silk
shrank
from
contact
with
meat
grinders
and
aluminum
stewpans
and
egg
beaters
and
waffle
irons
and
pie
tins
she
handled
them
contemptuously
she
sold
them
listlessly
after
weeks
of
expatiating
to
customers
on
the
beauties
and
excellencies
of
gossamer
lingerie
she
found
it
difficult
to
work
up
enthusiasm
over
the
virtues
of
dishpans
and
spice
boxes
by
noon
she
was
less
resentful
by
two
she
was
saying
to
a
fellow
clerk
well
anyway
in
this
section
you
do
have
to
tell
a
woman
how
graceful
and
charming
she
going
to
look
while
she
working
the
washing
machine
she
was
a
born
saleswoman
in
spite
of
herself
she
became
interested
in
the
buying
problems
of
the
practical
and
housewives
who
patronised
this
section
by
three
she
was
looking
thoughtful
thoughtful
and
contented
then
came
the
summons
the
lingerie
section
was
swamped
report
to
miss
jevne
at
once
almost
regretfully
ray
gave
her
customer
over
to
an
idle
clerk
and
sought
out
miss
jevne
some
of
that
lady
statuesqueness
was
gone
the
bar
pin
on
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
rapidly
she
espied
ray
and
met
her
halfway
in
her
hand
she
carried
a
soft
black
something
which
she
thrust
at
ray
here
put
that
on
in
one
of
the
fitting
rooms
be
quick
about
it
your
size
the
department
swamped
hurry
now
ray
took
from
miss
jevne
the
black
silk
gown
modest
but
modish
there
was
no
joy
in
ray
face
ten
minutes
later
she
emerged
in
the
limp
and
clinging
little
frock
that
toned
down
her
colour
and
made
her
plumpness
seem
but
rounded
charm
the
big
store
will
talk
for
many
a
day
of
that
afternoon
and
the
three
afternoons
that
followed
until
sunday
brought
pause
to
the
thousands
of
feet
beating
a
ceaseless
tattoo
up
and
down
the
thronged
aisles
on
the
monday
following
thousands
swarmed
down
upon
the
store
again
but
not
in
such
overwhelming
numbers
there
were
breathing
spaces
it
was
during
one
of
these
that
miss
myrtle
the
beauty
found
time
for
a
brief
moment
chat
with
ray
willets
ray
was
straightening
her
counter
again
she
had
a
passion
for
order
myrtle
eyed
her
wearily
her
slender
shoulders
had
carried
an
endless
number
and
variety
of
garments
during
those
four
days
and
her
feet
had
paced
weary
miles
that
those
garments
might
the
better
be
displayed
black
grand
on
you
observed
myrtle
tones
you
down
she
glanced
sharply
at
the
gown
looks
just
like
one
of
our
models
copy
it
no
said
ray
still
straightening
petticoats
and
corset
covers
myrtle
reached
out
a
weary
graceful
arm
and
touched
one
of
the
lacy
piles
adorned
with
cunning
bows
of
pink
and
blue
to
catch
the
shopping
eye
ai
that
sweet
she
exclaimed
i
crazy
about
that
shadow
lace
it
swell
under
voiles
i
wonder
if
i
could
take
one
of
them
home
to
copy
it
ray
glanced
up
oh
that
she
said
contemptuously
that
just
a
cheap
skirt
only
lace
imitation
embroidery
she
stopped
she
stared
a
moment
at
myrtle
with
the
fixed
and
gaze
of
one
who
does
not
see
what
i
just
say
to
you
huh
ejaculated
myrtle
mystified
what
i
just
say
repeated
ray
myrtle
laughed
half
understanding
you
said
that
was
a
cheap
junk
skirt
at
only
with
machine
lace
and
imitation
but
ray
willets
did
not
wait
to
hear
the
rest
she
was
off
down
the
aisle
toward
the
elevator
marked
employ√©es
the
office
was
on
the
ninth
floor
she
stopped
there
the
grey
superintendent
was
writing
at
his
desk
he
did
not
look
up
as
ray
entered
thus
observing
rules
one
and
two
in
the
proper
conduct
of
superintendents
when
interviewing
employees
ray
willets
standing
by
his
desk
did
not
cough
or
wriggle
or
rustle
her
skirts
or
sag
on
one
hip
a
consciousness
of
her
quiet
penetrated
the
superintendent
mind
he
glanced
up
hurriedly
over
his
left
shoulder
then
he
laid
down
his
pencil
and
sat
up
slowly
oh
it
you
he
said
yes
it
me
replied
ray
willets
simply
i
been
here
a
month
oh
yes
he
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
so
that
the
brown
forelock
stood
away
from
the
grey
you
lost
some
of
your
roses
he
said
and
tapped
his
cheek
what
the
trouble
i
guess
it
the
dress
explained
ray
and
glanced
down
at
the
folds
of
her
gown
she
hesitated
a
moment
awkwardly
you
said
you
send
for
me
at
the
end
of
the
month
you
did
that
all
right
said
the
grey
superintendent
i
was
pretty
sure
i
had
made
a
mistake
i
can
gauge
applicants
pretty
fairly
see
you
in
the
lingerie
are
you
yes
then
with
a
rush
that
what
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
i
changed
my
mind
i
do
want
to
stay
in
the
lingeries
i
like
to
be
transferred
to
the
kitchen
utensils
and
household
goods
transferred
well
i
see
what
i
can
do
what
was
the
name
now
i
forget
a
queer
look
stole
into
ray
willets
face
a
look
of
determination
and
shrewdness
name
she
said
my
name
is
rachel
wiletzky
viii
the
miss
sadie
corn
was
not
a
charmer
but
when
you
handed
your
to
her
you
found
yourself
stopping
to
chat
a
moment
if
you
were
the
right
kind
you
showed
her
your
wife
picture
in
the
front
of
your
watch
if
you
were
the
wrong
kind
with
your
scant
hair
carefully
combed
to
hide
the
bald
spot
you
showed
her
the
newspaper
clipping
that
you
carried
in
your
vest
pocket
following
inspection
of
the
first
sadie
corn
would
say
now
that
what
i
call
a
sweet
face
how
old
is
the
youngest
upon
perusal
the
second
was
returned
with
dignity
and
is
that
supposed
to
be
funny
in
each
case
sadie
corn
had
you
placed
for
life
she
possessed
the
invaluable
gift
of
the
floor
clerk
did
sadie
corn
that
of
remembering
names
and
faces
though
you
had
registered
at
the
hotel
magnifique
but
the
night
before
for
the
first
time
sadie
corn
would
look
up
at
you
over
her
glasses
as
she
laid
your
key
in
its
proper
row
and
say
good
morning
schultz
sleep
well
me
you
would
stammer
surprised
and
gratified
me
fine
h
thanks
whereupon
you
would
cross
your
right
foot
over
your
left
nonchalantly
and
enjoy
that
brief
moment
chat
with
floor
clerk
number
two
you
went
back
to
ishpeming
michigan
with
three
new
impressions
the
first
was
that
you
were
becoming
a
personage
of
considerable
importance
the
second
was
that
the
magnifique
realised
this
great
truth
and
was
grateful
for
your
patronage
the
third
was
that
new
york
was
a
friendly
little
hole
after
all
miss
sadie
corn
was
dean
of
the
hotel
magnifique
floor
clerks
the
primary
requisite
in
successful
floor
clerkship
is
homeliness
the
second
is
discreet
age
the
third
is
tact
and
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
think
the
duties
of
a
floor
clerk
end
when
she
takes
your
key
when
you
leave
your
room
and
hands
it
back
as
you
return
it
may
be
mentioned
that
the
fourth
fifth
sixth
and
seventh
requisites
are
diplomacy
ingenuity
unlimited
patience
and
a
comprehensive
knowledge
of
human
nature
ambassadors
have
been
known
to
keep
their
jobs
on
less
than
that
she
had
come
to
the
magnifique
at
a
plain
spare
sallow
woman
with
a
quiet
capable
manner
a
pungent
trick
of
the
tongue
on
occasion
a
sparse
fluff
of
hair
and
big
hands
such
as
you
see
on
women
who
have
the
gift
of
humanness
she
was
now
still
plain
still
spare
still
sallow
those
bony
fingers
had
handed
keys
to
potentates
and
and
millinery
buyers
from
seattle
and
to
princes
incognito
and
paupers
much
the
same
the
difference
being
that
the
princes
dressed
down
to
the
part
while
the
paupers
dressed
up
to
it
time
experience
understanding
and
the
daily
dealing
with
humanity
had
brought
certain
lines
into
sadie
corn
face
so
skilfully
were
they
placed
that
the
unobservant
put
them
down
as
wrinkles
on
the
countenance
of
a
homely
woman
but
he
who
read
as
he
ran
saw
that
the
lines
about
the
eyes
were
quizzical
shrewd
lines
which
come
from
the
practice
of
gauging
character
at
a
glance
that
the
meant
tolerance
and
sympathy
and
humour
that
the
forehead
furrows
had
been
carved
there
by
those
master
chisellers
suffering
and
sacrifice
in
the
last
three
or
four
years
sadie
corn
had
taken
to
wearing
a
little
crocheted
shawl
about
her
shoulders
on
cool
days
and
when
who
was
a
regular
caught
his
annual
heavy
cold
late
in
the
fall
sadie
would
ask
him
sharply
whether
he
had
on
his
winter
flannels
on
his
replying
in
the
negative
she
would
rebuke
him
scathingly
and
demand
a
bill
of
sizable
denomination
and
when
her
watch
was
over
she
would
sally
forth
to
purchase
four
sets
of
men
winter
underwear
as
captain
of
the
magnifique
floor
clerks
sadie
corn
authority
extended
from
the
parlours
to
the
roof
but
her
especial
domain
was
floor
two
ensconced
behind
her
little
desk
in
a
corner
blocked
in
by
mailracks
pantry
signals
chutes
and
telephone
with
a
clear
view
of
the
elevators
and
stairway
sadie
corn
was
mistress
of
the
moods
manners
and
morals
of
the
second
floor
it
was
six
thirty
on
monday
of
automobile
show
week
when
sadie
corn
came
on
watch
she
came
on
with
a
lively
case
of
neuralgia
over
her
right
eye
and
extending
down
into
her
back
teeth
with
its
usual
spitefulness
the
attack
had
chosen
to
make
its
appearance
during
her
long
watch
it
never
selected
her
days
when
she
was
on
duty
only
from
eleven
until
now
with
a
peppermint
bottle
held
close
to
alternately
sniffing
nostrils
sadie
corn
was
running
her
eye
over
the
complex
report
sheet
of
the
floor
clerk
who
had
just
gone
off
watch
the
report
was
even
more
detailed
and
lengthy
than
usual
automobile
show
week
meant
that
the
always
prosperous
magnifique
was
filled
to
the
eaves
and
turning
them
away
it
meant
twice
the
usual
number
of
inside
telephone
calls
anent
rooms
too
hot
rooms
too
cold
radiators
hammering
radiators
hissing
windows
that
refused
to
open
windows
that
refused
to
shut
packages
undelivered
hot
water
not
forthcoming
as
the
human
buffers
between
guests
and
hotel
management
it
was
the
duty
of
sadie
corn
and
her
diplomatic
squad
to
pacify
the
peevish
to
smooth
the
path
of
the
paying
down
the
hall
strolled
donahue
the
house
detective
donahue
the
leisurely
donahue
the
donahue
the
guileless
looking
in
his
evening
clothes
for
all
the
world
like
a
prosperous
he
smiled
benignly
upon
sadie
corn
and
sadie
corn
had
the
bravery
to
smile
back
in
spite
of
her
neuralgia
knowing
well
that
men
have
no
sympathy
with
that
anguishing
ailment
and
no
understanding
of
it
everything
serene
miss
corn
inquired
donahue
everything
serene
said
sadie
corn
though
telephoned
a
minute
ago
to
say
that
if
the
valet
did
bring
his
pants
from
the
presser
in
the
next
two
seconds
he
come
down
the
hall
as
he
is
and
get
perhaps
you
better
stay
round
donahue
chuckled
and
passed
on
half
way
down
the
hall
he
retraced
his
steps
and
stopped
again
before
sadie
corn
busy
desk
he
balanced
a
moment
thoughtfully
from
toe
to
heel
his
chin
lifted
inquiringly
keep
your
eye
on
and
this
morning
like
a
lynx
answered
sadie
anything
not
a
thing
i
guess
they
just
scraped
acquaintance
in
the
alley
after
dinner
like
they
sometimes
do
a
man
with
eyelashes
like
his
always
speaks
to
any
woman
alone
who
is
pockmarked
and
toothless
two
minutes
after
he
met
a
girl
his
voice
takes
on
the
note
i
know
his
kind
why
say
he
even
tried
waving
those
eyelashes
of
his
at
me
first
time
he
turned
in
his
key
and
goodness
knows
i
so
homely
that
pretty
soon
i
be
ripe
for
bachelor
floor
thirteen
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
to
qualify
for
that
job
a
floor
clerk
got
to
look
like
a
gargoyle
maybe
they
all
right
said
donahue
thoughtfully
if
it
just
a
flirtation
why
anyway
watch
this
evening
the
day
watch
listened
in
and
says
they
made
some
date
for
he
was
off
down
the
hall
again
with
his
light
quick
step
that
still
had
the
appearance
of
leisureliness
the
telephone
at
sadie
right
buzzed
warningly
sadie
picked
up
the
receiver
and
plunged
into
the
busiest
half
hour
of
the
evening
from
that
moment
until
seven
her
nimble
fingers
and
eyes
and
brain
and
tongue
directed
the
steps
of
her
little
world
she
held
the
telephone
receiver
at
one
ear
and
listened
to
the
demands
of
incoming
and
outgoing
guests
with
the
other
she
jotted
down
reports
dealt
out
mail
and
kept
her
neuralgic
eye
on
stairs
and
elevators
and
halls
her
sound
orb
on
tube
and
pantry
signals
while
through
and
between
and
above
all
she
guided
the
stream
of
humanity
that
trickled
past
her
desk
bellhops
polish
chambermaids
messenger
boys
guests
waiters
parlour
maids
just
before
seven
there
disembarked
at
floor
two
out
of
the
elevator
one
of
those
visions
that
have
helped
to
make
fifth
avenue
a
street
of
the
women
in
the
world
the
vision
was
and
her
clothes
were
of
the
kind
that
prepared
you
for
the
shock
that
you
got
when
you
looked
at
her
face
plume
met
fur
and
fur
met
silk
and
silk
met
lace
and
lace
met
gold
and
the
whole
met
and
ran
into
a
riot
of
colour
and
perfume
and
little
jangling
swishing
sounds
just
by
glancing
at
feet
in
their
inadequate
openwork
silk
and
soft
kid
you
knew
that
lips
would
be
carmined
she
came
down
the
corridor
and
stopped
at
sadie
corn
desk
sadie
corn
had
her
key
ready
for
her
took
it
daintily
between
fingers
i
want
a
maid
in
fifteen
minutes
she
said
tell
them
to
send
me
the
one
i
had
yesterday
the
pretty
one
she
is
so
clumsy
as
some
sadie
corn
jotted
down
a
note
without
looking
up
oh
julia
sorry
julia
busy
she
lied
knew
she
lied
because
at
that
moment
there
came
round
the
bend
in
the
broad
marble
stairway
that
led
up
from
the
parlour
floor
the
trim
slim
figure
of
julia
herself
took
a
quick
step
forward
here
girl
i
want
you
to
hook
me
in
fifteen
minutes
she
said
very
well
replied
julia
softly
there
passed
between
sadie
corn
and
a
well
you
could
hardly
call
it
a
look
it
was
so
fleeting
so
ephemeral
that
electric
pregnant
meaning
something
that
flashes
between
two
women
who
dislike
and
understand
each
other
then
was
off
down
the
hall
to
her
room
julia
stood
at
the
head
of
the
stairway
just
next
to
sadie
desk
and
watched
until
the
bend
in
the
corridor
hid
her
julia
of
the
staff
could
never
have
qualified
for
the
position
of
floor
clerk
even
if
she
had
chosen
to
bury
herself
in
crocheted
shawls
to
the
tip
of
her
marvellous
little
greek
nose
in
her
frilly
white
cap
her
trim
black
gown
her
immaculate
collar
and
cuffs
and
apron
julia
looked
distractingly
like
the
young
person
who
in
the
old
days
of
the
drama
was
wont
to
inform
you
that
it
was
two
years
since
young
master
went
away
all
but
her
feet
the
person
was
addicted
to
beaded
slippers
not
so
julia
julia
was
on
her
feet
for
ten
hours
or
so
a
day
when
you
subject
your
feet
to
tortures
you
are
apt
to
pass
by
effects
in
favour
of
something
laced
with
an
easy
comfortable
crack
here
and
there
at
the
sides
and
stockings
with
white
cotton
soles
julia
at
the
head
of
the
stairway
stood
looking
after
until
the
tail
of
her
silken
draperies
had
whisked
round
the
corner
then
still
staring
julia
spoke
resentfully
life
for
her
is
just
one
darned
pair
of
long
white
kid
gloves
after
another
look
at
her
why
is
it
that
kind
of
a
face
is
always
wearing
the
sables
and
diamonds
sables
and
diamonds
replied
sadie
corn
sniffing
essence
of
peppermint
seem
a
small
enough
reward
for
having
to
carry
round
a
mug
like
that
julia
came
round
to
the
front
of
sadie
corn
desk
her
eyes
were
brooding
her
lips
sullen
oh
i
do
know
she
said
bitterly
being
pretty
do
get
you
anything
just
being
pretty
when
i
first
came
i
used
to
wonder
at
those
women
that
paint
their
faces
and
colour
their
hair
and
wear
skirts
that
are
too
tight
and
waists
that
are
too
low
but
i
do
know
this
town
so
big
and
so
so
kind
of
uninterested
when
you
see
everybody
wearing
clothes
that
are
more
gorgeous
than
yours
and
diamonds
bigger
and
limousines
longer
and
blacker
and
quieter
it
gives
you
a
kind
of
fever
you
you
want
to
make
people
look
at
you
too
sadie
corn
leaned
back
in
her
chair
the
peppermint
bottle
was
held
at
her
nose
it
may
have
been
that
which
caused
her
eyes
to
narrow
to
mere
slits
as
she
gazed
at
the
drooping
julia
she
said
nothing
suddenly
julia
seemed
to
feel
the
silence
she
looked
down
at
sadie
corn
as
by
a
miracle
all
the
harsh
sullen
lines
in
the
girl
face
vanished
to
be
replaced
by
a
lovely
compassion
your
neuralgy
again
dearie
she
asked
in
pretty
concern
sadie
sniffed
long
and
audibly
at
the
peppermint
bottle
if
you
ask
me
i
think
there
some
imp
inside
of
my
head
trying
to
push
my
right
eye
out
with
his
thumb
anyway
it
feels
like
that
poor
old
dear
breathed
julia
it
the
weather
have
them
send
you
up
a
pot
of
black
tea
when
you
got
neuralgy
over
your
right
eye
observed
sadie
corn
grimly
there
just
one
thing
helps
that
is
to
crawl
into
bed
in
a
flannel
nightgown
with
the
side
of
your
face
resting
on
the
red
rubber
bosom
of
a
bottle
and
i
ca
do
it
so
let
talk
about
something
cheerful
seen
jo
there
crept
into
julia
face
a
wave
of
colour
not
the
pink
of
pleasure
but
the
dull
red
of
pain
she
looked
away
from
sadie
eyes
and
down
at
her
shabby
boots
the
sullen
look
was
in
her
face
once
more
no
i
ai
seen
him
she
said
what
the
trouble
sadie
asked
i
been
busy
replied
julia
airily
then
with
a
forced
vivacity
though
it
nothing
to
auto
show
week
last
year
i
remember
that
week
i
hooked
up
until
my
fingers
were
stiff
you
know
the
way
the
dresses
fastened
last
winter
some
of
ought
to
have
had
a
map
to
go
by
they
were
that
complicated
and
now
just
when
i
got
so
i
can
hook
any
dress
that
was
ever
intended
for
the
human
form
was
it
jo
who
said
they
ought
to
give
away
an
engineering
blueprint
with
every
dress
when
you
told
him
about
the
way
they
hooked
put
in
sadie
what
the
trouble
between
you
and
julia
rattled
on
unheeding
you
would
believe
what
a
difference
there
been
since
these
new
peasant
styles
have
come
in
and
the
oriental
craze
hook
down
the
side
most
of
and
they
can
do
themselves
if
they
ai
too
fat
remember
jo
saying
they
ought
to
have
a
hydraulic
press
for
some
of
those
skintight
dames
when
your
fingers
were
sore
from
trying
to
squeeze
them
into
their
casings
by
the
way
what
the
trouble
between
you
and
makes
an
awful
difference
in
my
tips
cut
in
julia
deftly
i
believe
i
hooked
up
six
this
evening
and
two
of
them
sprung
the
women
are
devils
i
wish
sadie
corn
leaned
forward
placed
her
hand
on
julia
arm
and
turned
the
girl
about
so
that
she
faced
her
julia
tried
miserably
to
escape
her
keen
eyes
and
failed
what
the
trouble
between
you
and
jo
she
demanded
for
the
fourth
time
out
with
it
or
i
telephone
down
to
the
engine
room
and
ask
him
myself
oh
well
if
you
want
to
know
she
paused
her
eyelids
drooping
again
then
with
a
rush
me
and
jo
have
quarrelled
again
for
good
this
time
i
through
what
about
i
you
say
i
to
blame
jo
mother
sick
again
she
got
to
go
to
the
hospital
and
have
another
operation
you
know
what
that
means
putting
off
the
wedding
again
until
god
knows
when
i
sick
of
it
putting
off
and
putting
off
i
told
him
we
might
as
well
quit
and
be
done
with
it
we
never
get
married
at
this
rate
soon
jo
gets
enough
put
by
to
start
us
on
something
happens
last
three
times
been
his
ma
pretty
soon
i
be
as
old
and
wrinkled
and
homely
as
as
me
put
in
sadie
calmly
well
i
do
know
that
the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
to
you
i
happy
i
had
my
plans
too
when
i
was
a
girl
like
you
not
that
i
was
ever
pretty
but
i
had
my
trials
funny
how
the
thing
that
easy
and
the
thing
that
right
never
seem
to
be
the
same
oh
i
fond
of
jo
ma
said
julia
a
little
shamefacedly
we
get
along
all
right
she
knows
how
it
is
i
guess
and
feels
well
in
the
way
but
when
jo
told
me
i
was
tired
i
guess
we
had
words
i
told
him
there
were
plenty
waiting
for
me
if
he
was
through
i
told
him
i
could
have
gone
out
with
a
real
swell
only
last
saturday
if
i
wanted
to
what
a
girl
got
her
looks
for
if
not
to
have
a
good
time
who
this
you
were
invited
out
by
asked
sadie
corn
you
must
have
noticed
him
said
julia
dimpling
he
as
handsome
as
an
actor
name
venner
he
in
there
came
the
look
of
steel
into
sadie
corn
eyes
look
here
julia
you
been
here
long
enough
to
know
that
you
not
to
listen
to
the
talk
of
the
men
guests
round
here
is
your
kind
and
you
know
it
if
i
catch
you
talking
to
him
again
i
the
telephone
at
her
elbow
sounded
sharply
she
answered
it
absently
her
eyes
with
their
expression
of
pain
and
remonstrance
still
unshrinking
before
the
onslaught
of
julia
glare
then
her
expression
changed
a
look
of
consternation
came
into
her
face
right
away
madam
she
said
at
the
telephone
right
away
you
have
to
wait
another
minute
she
hung
up
the
receiver
and
waved
julia
away
with
a
gesture
it
you
promised
to
be
there
in
fifteen
minutes
she
been
waiting
and
her
voice
sounds
like
a
saw
better
be
careful
how
you
handle
her
julia
head
with
its
sleek
satiny
coils
of
black
hair
that
waved
away
so
bewitchingly
from
the
cream
of
her
skin
came
up
with
a
jerk
i
tired
of
being
careful
of
other
people
feelings
let
somebody
be
careful
of
mine
for
a
change
she
walked
off
down
the
hall
the
little
head
still
held
high
a
half
dozen
paces
and
she
turned
what
was
it
you
said
you
do
to
me
if
you
caught
me
talking
to
him
again
she
sneered
a
miserable
twinge
of
pain
shot
through
sadie
corn
eye
to
be
followed
by
a
wave
of
nausea
that
swept
over
her
they
alone
were
responsible
for
her
answer
i
report
you
she
snapped
and
was
sorry
at
once
julia
turned
again
walked
down
the
corridor
and
round
the
corner
in
the
direction
of
long
after
julia
had
disappeared
sadie
corn
stared
after
her
miserable
regretful
julia
knocked
once
at
the
door
of
and
turned
the
knob
before
a
high
shrill
voice
cried
come
was
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
in
scant
satin
knickerbockers
and
tight
brassi√®re
the
blazing
folds
of
a
cerise
satin
gown
held
in
her
hands
made
a
great
crude
patch
of
colour
in
the
bedroom
the
air
was
heavy
with
scent
hair
teeth
eyes
fingernails
glowed
and
glistened
chairs
and
bed
held
odds
and
ends
where
you
been
girl
shrilled
i
been
waiting
like
a
fool
i
told
you
to
be
here
in
fifteen
minutes
my
is
working
right
replied
julia
impudently
and
took
the
cerise
satin
gown
in
her
two
hands
she
made
a
ring
of
the
gown
opening
and
through
that
cerise
frame
her
eyes
met
those
of
careful
of
my
hair
warned
her
and
ducked
her
head
to
the
practised
movement
of
julia
arms
the
cerise
gown
dropped
to
her
shoulders
without
grazing
a
hair
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
she
turned
to
face
the
mirror
it
starts
at
the
left
three
hooks
then
to
the
centre
then
back
four
under
the
arm
and
down
the
middle
again
that
chiffon
comes
over
like
a
drape
she
picked
up
a
buffer
from
the
litter
of
ivory
and
silver
on
the
dresser
and
began
to
polish
her
already
glittering
nails
turning
her
head
this
way
and
that
preening
her
neck
biting
her
scarlet
lips
to
deepen
their
crimson
opening
her
eyes
wide
and
half
closing
them
languorously
julia
down
on
her
knees
in
combat
with
the
trickiest
of
the
hooks
glanced
up
and
saw
caught
the
glance
in
the
mirror
she
stopped
her
idle
polishing
and
preening
to
study
the
glowing
and
lovely
little
face
that
looked
up
at
her
a
certain
queer
expression
grew
in
her
eyes
a
speculative
eager
look
tell
me
little
girl
she
said
what
do
you
do
round
here
julia
turned
from
the
mirror
to
the
last
of
the
hooks
her
fingers
working
nimbly
me
my
regular
job
is
working
do
jerk
please
i
fastened
this
one
three
times
working
laughed
fingering
the
diamonds
at
her
throat
what
does
a
pretty
girl
like
you
want
to
do
that
for
hook
off
here
said
julia
shall
i
sew
it
pin
it
snapped
julia
tidy
nature
revolted
it
take
just
a
minute
to
catch
it
with
thread
whirled
about
in
one
of
the
sudden
hot
rages
of
her
kind
pin
it
you
fool
pin
it
i
told
you
i
was
late
julia
paused
a
moment
the
red
surging
into
her
face
then
in
silence
she
knelt
and
wove
a
pin
deftly
in
and
out
when
she
rose
from
her
knees
her
face
was
quite
white
there
that
the
girl
said
blithely
her
rage
forgotten
just
pat
this
over
my
shoulders
she
handed
a
to
julia
and
turned
her
back
to
the
broad
mirror
holding
a
high
as
she
watched
the
puff
leaving
a
snowy
coat
on
the
neck
and
shoulders
and
back
so
generously
displayed
in
the
gown
julia
face
was
set
and
hard
oh
now
do
sulk
coaxed
all
of
a
sudden
i
hate
sulky
girls
i
like
people
to
be
cheerful
round
me
i
not
used
to
being
yelled
at
julia
said
resentfully
patted
her
cheek
lightly
you
come
out
with
me
and
i
buy
you
something
pretty
do
you
like
pretty
clothes
yes
but
of
course
you
do
every
girl
does
especially
pretty
ones
like
you
how
do
you
like
this
dress
do
you
think
it
smart
she
turned
squarely
to
face
julia
trying
on
her
the
tricks
she
had
practised
in
the
mirror
a
little
cruel
look
came
into
julia
face
last
year
is
it
she
asked
coolly
this
cried
stiffening
last
year
i
got
it
yesterday
on
fifth
avenue
and
paid
two
hundred
and
fifty
for
it
what
do
you
oh
i
believe
you
drawled
julia
they
can
tell
a
new
yorker
from
an
every
time
you
know
the
really
new
thing
is
the
bulgarian
effect
well
of
all
the
nerve
began
turning
to
the
mirror
in
a
sort
of
fright
of
all
the
what
she
saw
there
seemed
to
reassure
she
raised
one
hand
to
push
the
gown
a
little
more
off
the
left
shoulder
will
there
be
anything
else
inquired
julia
standing
aloof
turned
reluctantly
from
the
mirror
and
picked
up
a
jewelled
bag
that
lay
on
the
bed
from
it
she
extracted
a
coin
and
held
it
out
to
julia
it
was
a
generous
coin
julia
looked
at
it
her
smouldering
wrath
burst
into
flame
keep
it
she
said
savagely
and
was
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
hall
sadie
corn
at
her
desk
looked
up
quickly
as
julia
turned
the
corner
julia
her
head
held
high
kept
her
eyes
resolutely
away
from
sadie
oh
julia
i
want
to
talk
to
you
said
sadie
corn
as
julia
reached
the
stairway
julia
began
to
descend
the
stairs
unheeding
sadie
corn
rose
and
leaned
over
the
railing
her
face
puckered
with
anxiety
now
julia
girl
do
hold
that
up
against
me
i
did
mean
it
you
know
that
you
would
be
mad
at
a
poor
old
woman
that
half
crazy
with
neuralgy
julia
hesitated
one
foot
poised
to
take
the
next
step
come
on
up
coaxed
sadie
corn
and
tell
me
what
wearing
this
evening
i
that
lonesome
with
nothing
to
do
but
sit
here
and
watch
the
go
flippering
down
the
mailchute
come
on
what
made
you
say
you
report
me
demanded
julia
bitterly
i
have
said
the
same
thing
to
my
own
daughter
if
i
had
one
you
know
yourself
i
bite
my
tongue
out
first
well
said
julia
slowly
and
relented
she
came
up
the
stairs
almost
shyly
neuralgy
any
better
worse
said
sadie
corn
cheerfully
julia
leaned
against
the
desk
sociably
and
glanced
down
the
hall
would
you
believe
it
she
snickered
she
wearing
red
with
that
hair
she
asked
me
if
i
did
think
she
looked
too
pale
i
wanted
to
tell
her
that
if
she
had
any
more
colour
with
that
dress
they
be
likely
to
use
the
chemical
sprinklers
on
her
when
she
struck
the
alley
breathed
sadie
in
warning
in
her
shimmering
costume
was
coming
down
the
hall
toward
the
elevators
she
walked
with
the
absurd
and
stumbling
step
that
her
scant
skirt
necessitated
with
each
pace
the
slashed
silken
skirt
parted
to
reveal
a
shameless
glimpse
of
cerise
silk
stocking
in
her
wake
came
venner
of
a
strange
contrast
in
his
black
and
white
sadie
and
julia
watched
them
from
the
corner
nook
opposite
the
desk
stopped
and
turned
to
julia
just
run
into
my
room
and
pick
things
up
and
hang
them
away
will
you
she
said
i
did
have
time
and
i
hate
things
all
about
when
i
come
in
dead
tired
the
little
formula
of
service
rose
automatically
to
julia
lips
very
well
madam
she
said
her
eyes
and
sadie
followed
the
two
figures
until
they
had
stepped
into
the
elevator
and
had
vanished
sadie
peppermint
bottle
at
nose
spoke
first
she
makes
one
of
those
sandwich
men
with
a
bell
on
sixth
avenue
look
like
a
shrinking
violet
julia
lower
lip
was
caught
between
her
teeth
the
scent
that
had
enveloped
as
she
passed
was
still
in
the
air
nostrils
dilated
as
she
sniffed
it
her
breath
came
a
little
quickly
sadie
corn
sat
very
still
watching
her
look
at
her
said
julia
her
voice
vibrant
look
at
her
old
and
homely
and
all
made
up
i
powdered
her
neck
her
skin
like
tripe
now
julia
remonstrated
sadie
corn
soothingly
i
do
care
went
on
julia
with
a
rush
i
young
and
i
pretty
too
and
i
like
pretty
things
it
ai
fair
that
was
one
reason
why
i
broke
with
jo
it
was
only
his
mother
i
told
him
he
could
ever
give
me
the
things
i
want
anyway
you
ca
help
wanting
seeing
them
all
round
every
day
on
women
that
are
half
as
as
you
are
i
want
dresses
too
my
neck
like
milk
i
want
silk
underneath
and
fur
coming
up
on
my
coat
collar
to
make
my
cheeks
look
pink
i
sick
of
hooking
other
women
up
i
want
to
stand
in
front
of
a
mirror
looking
at
myself
polishing
my
pink
nails
with
a
silver
thing
and
having
somebody
else
hook
me
up
in
sadie
corn
eyes
there
was
a
mist
that
could
not
be
traced
to
neuralgia
or
peppermint
julia
girl
said
sadie
corn
ever
since
the
world
began
there
been
hookers
and
hooked
and
there
always
will
be
i
was
born
a
hooker
so
were
you
time
was
when
i
used
to
cry
out
against
it
too
but
shucks
i
know
better
now
i
would
change
places
being
a
hooker
gives
you
such
an
experience
like
of
mankind
the
hooked
only
get
a
front
view
they
only
see
faces
and
arms
and
chests
but
the
hookers
they
see
the
necks
and
shoulderblades
of
this
world
as
well
as
faces
mighty
broadening
being
a
hooker
it
the
hookers
that
keep
this
world
together
julia
and
fastened
up
right
it
would
amount
to
much
if
it
had
to
depend
on
such
as
that
she
nodded
her
head
in
the
direction
the
cerise
figure
had
taken
the
height
of
her
ambition
is
to
get
the
cuticle
of
her
nails
trained
back
so
perfectly
that
it
wo
have
to
be
cut
and
she
do
feel
decently
dressed
to
be
seen
in
public
unless
she
wearing
one
of
those
breastplates
of
orchids
envy
her
why
julia
do
you
know
that
as
you
were
standing
here
in
your
black
dress
as
she
passed
she
was
envying
you
envying
me
said
julia
and
laughed
a
short
laugh
that
had
little
of
mirth
in
it
you
do
understand
sadie
sadie
corn
smiled
a
rather
sad
little
smile
oh
yes
i
do
understand
do
think
because
a
woman
homely
and
always
has
been
that
she
does
have
the
same
heartaches
that
a
pretty
woman
has
she
built
just
the
same
inside
julia
turned
her
head
to
stare
at
her
it
was
a
long
and
trying
stare
as
though
she
now
saw
sadie
corn
for
the
first
time
sadie
smiling
up
at
the
girl
stood
it
bravely
then
with
a
sudden
little
gesture
julia
patted
the
wrinkled
sallow
cheek
and
was
off
down
the
hall
and
round
the
corner
to
the
lights
still
blazed
in
the
bedroom
julia
closed
the
door
and
stood
with
her
back
to
it
looking
about
the
disordered
chamber
in
that
marvellous
way
a
room
has
of
reflecting
the
very
personality
of
its
absent
owner
room
bore
silent
testimony
to
the
manner
of
woman
who
had
just
left
it
the
air
was
close
and
overpoweringly
sweet
with
perfume
sachet
powder
the
scent
of
a
bedroom
after
a
vain
and
selfish
woman
has
left
it
the
litter
of
toilet
articles
lay
scattered
about
on
the
dresser
chairs
and
bed
held
garments
of
lace
and
silk
a
bewildering
neglig√©e
hung
limply
over
a
couch
and
next
it
stood
a
slipper
its
mate
on
the
floor
julia
saw
these
things
in
one
accustomed
glance
then
she
advanced
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
stooped
to
pick
up
a
pink
wadded
bedroom
slipper
from
where
it
lay
under
the
bed
and
her
hand
touched
a
coat
of
velvet
and
fur
that
had
been
flung
across
the
counterpane
touched
it
and
rested
there
the
coat
was
of
stamped
velvet
and
fur
great
cuffs
of
fur
there
were
and
a
sumptuous
collar
that
rolled
from
neck
to
waist
there
was
a
lining
of
vivid
orange
julia
straightened
up
and
stood
regarding
the
garment
her
hands
on
her
hips
i
wonder
if
it
draped
in
the
back
she
said
to
herself
and
picked
it
up
it
was
draped
in
the
back
bewitchingly
she
held
it
at
length
turning
it
this
way
and
that
then
as
though
obeying
some
powerful
force
she
could
not
resist
julia
plunged
her
arms
into
the
satin
of
the
sleeves
and
brought
the
great
soft
revers
up
about
her
throat
the
great
gorgeous
shimmering
thing
completely
hid
her
grubby
little
black
gown
she
stepped
to
the
mirror
and
stood
surveying
herself
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
her
cheeks
glowed
against
the
dark
fur
as
she
had
known
they
would
her
lovely
little
head
with
its
coils
of
black
hair
rose
flowerlike
from
the
clinging
garment
she
was
still
standing
there
lips
parted
eyes
wide
with
delight
when
the
door
opened
and
closed
and
venner
of
strode
into
the
room
you
little
beauty
exclaimed
julia
had
wheeled
about
she
stood
staring
at
him
eyes
and
lips
wide
with
fright
now
one
hand
clutched
the
fur
at
her
breast
why
what
she
gasped
laughed
i
knew

find
you
here
i
made
an
excuse
to
come
up
old
nutcracker
face
in
the
hall

i
went
to
my
own
room
he
took
two
quick
steps
forward
you
raving
little
cinderella
beauty

and
he
gathered
julia
coat
and
all
into
his
arms
let
me
go

julia
fighting
with
all
the
strength
of
her
young
arms
let
me

ear

dozen
of

ten
times
the
beauty

are
now
and
that
saying
something
listen
you
meet
me
there
came
a
ring
sudden
and
startling
from
the
telephone
on
the
wall
near
the
door
the
man
uttered
something
and
turned
julia
pushed
him
away
loosened
the
coat
with
fingers
that
shook
and
dropped
it
to
the
floor
it
lay
in
a
shimmering
circle
about
the
tired
feet
in
their
worn
cracked
boots
and
one
foot
was
raised
suddenly
and
kicked
the
silken
garment
into
a
heap
the
telephone
bell
sounded
again
venner
of
plunged
his
hand
into
his
pocket
took
out
something
and
pressed
it
in
palm
shutting
her
fingers
over
it
julia
did
not
need
to
open
them
and
look
to
see
she
knew
by
the
feel
of
the
crumpled
paper
stiff
and
crackling
he
was
making
for
the
door
with
some
last
instructions
that
she
did
not
hear
before
she
spoke
the
telephone
bell
had
stopped
its
insistent
ringing
julia
raised
her
arm
and
hurled
at
him
with
all
her
might
the
paper
he
had
thrust
in
her
hand
i
i
get
my
man
to
whip

panted
jo

eyelashes
of
yours

and

miserable
little
the
outside
door
opened
again
striking
squarely
in
the
back
he
crumpled
up
against
the
wall
with
an
oath
sadie
corn
in
the
doorway
gave
no
heed
to
him
her
eyes
searched
julia
flushed
face
what
she
saw
there
seemed
to
satisfy
her
she
turned
to
him
then
grimly
what
are
you
doing
here
sadie
asked
briskly
muttered
something
about
the
wrong
room
by
mistake
julia
laughed
he
lies
she
said
and
pointed
to
the
floor
that
bill
belongs
to
him
sadie
corn
motioned
to
him

it
up
she
said
i
do

very
carefully
he
came
forward
stooped
put
the
bill

his
pocket

said
sadie
corn
then
at
a
muttered
remonstrance
from
him
oh

slunk
off
why

the
phone
that
was

ringing
a
sob
caught
julia
in
the
throat
but
she
turned
it
into
a
laugh
i
did
hardly
hear

i
was
busy
promising
him
a
licking
from
jo
sadie
corn

julia
stared
at
her
for
one
dreadful
moment
her
fist
with
the
knuckles
showing
white
pressed
against
her
mouth
a
little
moan
came
from
her
that
repeated
over
and
over
took
the
form
of
words
oh
sadie
if
i
could
only
take
back
what
i
said
to
jo
if
i
could
only

said
sadie
corn
but
you
never
forgive

that
as
it
should
be
that
you

our
punishment
for
what
we
say
in
thoughtlessness
and
anger
they
turned
the
corridor
corner
standing
before
the
desk
near
the
stairway
was
the
tall
figure
of
donahue
house
detective
donahue
had
always
said
that

was
too
pretty
to
be

whispered
sadie
corn
and
smile
if
it
kills
you
unless
you
want
to
make
me
tell
the
whole
of
it
to
donahue
donahue
the
balancing
as
was
his

back
again
his

the

off

inquired
donahue
pleasantly
staring
at
julia
eyes
what
wrong
with
julia
neuralgy
said
sadie
corn
crisply
i
just
told
her
to
quit
rubbing
her
head
with
peppermint
she
got
the
stuff
into
her
eyes
she
picked
up
the
bottle
on
her
desk
and
studied
its

frowning

along
downstairs

donahue
hands
clasped
behind

walking
off
in
his
leisurely
way
everything
serene

called
back
over
his
big

closed
and
opened
perhaps
with
another
twinge

hat
and
her
dreadful
english
fringe
and
her
english
cheeks
which
not
even
the
enervating
italian
sun
the
years
of
bad
italian
food
or
the
damp
and
dim
little
roman
room
had
been
able
to
sallow
mary
gowd
with
her
shabby
blue
suit
and
her
mangy
bit
of
fur
and
the
glint
of
humour
in
her
pale
blue
eyes
many
many
times
that
same
glint
of
humour
had
saved
english
mary
gowd
from
seeking
peace

muddy
old
tiber

cicerone
certificated
and
licensed
lecturer
on

archaeology
via
del
babbuino
roma
in
plain
language
mary
gowd
was
a
guide
now
rome
is
swarming
with
guides
but
they
are
men
guides
they
besiege
you
in
front
of
cook
they
perch
at
the
top
of
the
capitoline
hill
ready
to
pounce
on
you
when
you
arrive
panting
from
your
climb
up
the
shallow
steps
they
lie
in
wait
in
the
doorway
of
peter
bland
suave
smiling
quiet
but
insistent
they
dog
you
from
the
vatican
to
the
catacombs
hundreds
there
are
of
these
little
men
undersized
even
in
this
land
of
small
men
dapper
agile
crafty
in
his
inner
coat
pocket
each
carries
his
credentials
greasy
documents
but
precious
he
glances
at
your
shoes
this
insinuating
one
or
at
your
hat
or
at
any
of
those
myriad
signs
by
which
he
marks
you
for
his
own
then
up
he
steps
and
speaks
to
you
in
the
language
of
your
country
be
you
french
german
english
spanish
or
american
and
each
one
of
this
clan
each
slim
feline
little
man
in
blue
serge
brisk
hated
mary
gowd
they
hated
her
with
the
hate
of
an
italian
for
an
outlander
with
the
hate
of
an
italian
for
a
woman
who
works
with
her
brain
with
the
hate
of
an
italian
who
sees
another
taking
the
bread
out
of
his
mouth
all
this
coupled
with
the
fact
that
your
italian
is
a
hater
may
indicate
that
the
life
of
mary
gowd
had
not
the
lyric
lilt
that
life
is
commonly
reputed
to
have
in
sunny
italy
oh
there
is
no
formula
for
mary
gowd
story
in
the
first
place
the
tale
of
how
mary
gowd
came
to
be
the
one
woman
guide
in
rome
runs
like
melodrama
and
mary
herself
from
her
white
cotton
gloves
darned
at
the
fingers
to
her
figure
which
mysteriously
remained
the
same
in
spite
of
fifteen
years
of
scant
italian
fare
does
not
fit
gracefully
into
the
r√¥le
of
heroine
perhaps
that
story
scraped
to
bedrock
shorn
of
all
floral
features
may
gain
in
force
what
it
loses
in
artistry
she
was
when
she
came
to
rome
and
she
had
been
pretty
with
that
prettiness
of
the
provincial
english
girl
who
degenerates
into
blowsiness
at
thirty
since
seventeen
she
had
saved
and
scrimped
and
contrived
for
this
modest
roman
holiday
she
had
given
painting
lessons
even
painted
on
loathsome
china
that
the
little
hoard
might
grow
and
when
at
last
there
was
enough
she
had
come
to
this
rome
against
the
protests
of
the
fussy
english
father
and
the
spinster
english
sister
the
man
she
met
quite
casually
one
morning
in
the
sistine
chapel
perhaps
he
bumped
her
elbow
as
they
stood
staring
up
at
the
glorious
ceiling
a
thousand
pardons
ah
an
artist
too
in
five
minutes
they
were
chattering
like
mad
she
in
bad
french
and
exquisite
english
he
in
bad
english
and
exquisite
french
he
knew
rome
its
pictures
its
glories
its
history
as
only
an
italian
can
and
he
taught
her
art
and
he
taught
her
italian
and
he
taught
her
love
and
so
they
were
married
or
ostensibly
married
though
mary
did
not
know
the
truth
until
three
months
later
when
he
left
her
quite
as
casually
as
he
had
met
her
taking
with
him
the
little
hoard
and
english
trinkets
and
mary
english
roses
and
mary
broken
pride
so
there
was
no
going
back
to
the
fussy
father
or
the
spinster
sister
she
came
very
near
resting
her
head
on
father
tiber
breast
in
those
days
she
would
sit
in
the
great
galleries
for
hours
staring
at
the
then
one
day
again
in
the
sistine
chapel
a
fussy
little
american
woman
had
approached
her
her
eyes
snapping
mary
was
sketching
or
trying
to
do
you
speak
english
i
am
english
said
mary
the
feathers
in
the
hat
of
the
fussy
little
woman
quivered
then
tell
me
is
this
ceiling
by
raphael
ceiling
gasped
mary
gowd
raphael
then
very
gently
she
gave
the
master
name
of
course
snapped
the
excited
little
american
i
one
of
a
party
of
eight
we
all
and
this
guide
she
waved
a
hand
in
the
direction
of
a
rapt
little
group
standing
in
the
agonising
position
the
ceiling
demands
just
informed
us
that
the
ceiling
is
by
raphael
and
we
paying
him
ten
lire
wo
you
sit
here
mary
gowd
made
a
place
for
her
i
tell
you
and
she
did
tell
her
finding
a
certain
relief
from
her
pain
in
unfolding
to
this
commonplace
little
woman
the
glory
of
the
masterpiece
among
masterpieces
why
why
gasped
her
listener
who
had
long
since
beckoned
the
other
seven
with
frantic
finger
how
beautifully
you
explain
it
how
much
you
know
oh
why
ca
they
talk
as
you
do
she
wailed
her
eyes
full
of
contempt
for
the
despised
guide
i
am
happy
to
have
helped
you
said
mary
gowd
helped
why
there
are
hundreds
of
americans
who
would
give
anything
to
have
some
one
like
you
to
be
with
them
in
rome
mary
gowd
whole
body
stiffened
she
stared
fixedly
at
the
grateful
little
american
some
one
like
me
the
little
teacher
blushed
very
red
i
beg
your
pardon
i
was
thinking
of
course
you
do
need
to
do
any
such
work
but
i
just
could
help
saying
but
i
do
need
work
interrupted
mary
gowd
she
stood
up
her
cheeks
pink
again
for
the
moment
her
eyes
bright
i
thank
you
oh
i
thank
you
you
thank
me
faltered
the
american
but
mary
gowd
had
folded
her
sketchbook
and
was
off
through
the
vestibule
down
the
splendid
corridor
past
the
giant
swiss
guard
to
the
noisy
sunny
piazza
di
san
pietro
that
had
been
fifteen
years
ago
she
had
taken
her
guide
examinations
and
passed
them
she
knew
her
rome
from
the
crypt
of
peter
to
the
top
of
the
janiculum
hill
from
the
campagna
to
tivoli
she
read
and
studied
and
learned
she
delved
into
the
past
and
brought
up
strange
and
interesting
truths
she
could
tell
you
weird
stories
of
those
white
marble
men
who
lay
so
peacefully
beneath
peter
dome
their
ringed
hands
crossed
on
their
breasts
she
learned
to
juggle
dates
with
an
ease
that
brought
gasps
from
her
american
clients
with
their
history
that
went
back
little
more
than
one
hundred
years
she
learned
to
designate
as
new
anything
that
failed
to
have
its
origin
stamped
and
the
magnificent
augustus
he
who
boasted
of
finding
rome
brick
and
leaving
it
marble
was
a
mere
with
his
miserable
she
was
as
much
at
home
in
the
thermae
of
caracalla
as
you
in
your
bath
she
could
juggle
the
history
of
emperors
with
one
hand
and
the
scandals
of
half
a
dozen
kings
with
the
other
no
ruin
was
too
unimportant
for
her
attention
no
picture
too
faded
for
her
research
she
had
the
centuries
at
her
tongue
end
michelangelo
and
canova
were
her
brothers
in
art
and
rome
was
to
her
as
your
patch
is
to
you
mary
gowd
hated
this
rome
as
only
an
english
woman
can
who
has
spent
fifteen
years
in
that
nest
of
intrigue
she
fought
the
whole
race
of
roman
guides
day
after
day
she
no
longer
turned
sick
and
faint
when
they
hissed
after
her
vile
italian
epithets
that
her
american
or
english
clients
quite
failed
to
understand
quite
unconcernedly
she
would
jam
down
the
lever
of
the
taximeter
the
wily
italian
cabby
had
pulled
only
halfway
so
that
the
meter
might
register
double
and
when
that
one
crowned
his
heap
of
abuse
by
screaming
at
her
she
would
merely
shrug
her
shoulders
and
say
presto
to
show
him
she
was
above
quarrelling
with
a
cabman
she
ate
eggs
and
bread
and
drank
the
red
wine
never
having
conquered
her
disgust
for
italian
meat
since
first
she
saw
the
filthy
carcasses
loathsome
being
carted
through
the
swarming
streets
it
was
six
of
an
evening
early
in
march
when
mary
gowd
went
home
to
the
murky
little
room
in
the
via
babbuino
she
was
too
tired
to
notice
the
sunset
she
was
too
tired
to
smile
at
the
baby
of
the
cobbler
wife
who
lived
in
the
rear
she
was
too
tired
to
ask
tina
for
the
letters
that
seldom
came
it
had
been
a
particularly
trying
day
spent
with
a
party
of
twenty
germans
who
had
said
when
she
showed
them
the
marvels
of
the
vatican
and
at
the
grandeur
of
the
colosseum
and
for
the
rest
had
kept
their
noses
buried
in
their
baedekers
she
groped
her
way
cautiously
down
the
black
hall
tina
had
a
habit
of
leaving
sundry
brushes
pans
or
babies
lying
about
after
the
warmth
of
the
march
sun
outdoors
the
house
was
cold
with
that
clammy
penetrating
tomblike
chill
of
the
italian
home
tina
she
called
from
the
rear
of
the
house
came
a
cackle
of
voices
tina
was
gossiping
there
was
no
smell
of
supper
in
the
air
mary
gowd
shrugged
patient
shoulders
then
before
taking
off
the
dowdy
hat
before
removing
the
white
cotton
gloves
she
went
to
the
window
that
overlooked
the
noisy
via
babbuino
closed
the
massive
wooden
shutters
fastened
the
heavy
windows
and
drew
the
thick
curtains
then
she
stood
a
moment
eyes
shut
in
that
little
room
the
roar
of
rome
was
tamed
to
a
dull
humming
mary
gowd
born
and
bred
amid
the
green
of
northern
england
had
never
become
hardened
to
the
maddening
noises
of
the
via
babbuino
the
rattle
and
clatter
of
cab
wheels
the
of
thousands
of
hoofs
the
shrill
high
cry
of
the
street
venders
the
blasts
of
motor
horns
that
seemed
to
rend
the
narrow
street
the
roar
and
rumble
of
the
electric
trams
the
wail
of
fretful
babies
the
chatter
of
gossiping
women
and
above
and
through
and
below
it
all
the
cracking
of
the
cabman
whip
that
sceptre
of
the
roman
cabby
that
wand
which
is
one
part
whip
and
nine
parts
crack
sometimes
it
seemed
to
mary
gowd
that
her
brain
was
seared
and
welted
by
the
reports
of
those
eternal
whips
she
came
forward
now
and
lighted
a
candle
that
stood
on
the
table
and
another
on
the
dresser
their
dim
light
seemed
to
make
dimmer
the
dark
little
room
she
looked
about
with
a
little
shiver
then
she
sank
into
the
chair
that
was
the
one
bit
of
england
in
the
sombre
chamber
she
took
off
the
dusty
black
velvet
hat
passed
a
hand
over
her
hair
with
a
gesture
that
was
more
tired
than
tidy
and
sat
back
her
eyes
shut
her
body
inert
her
head
sagging
on
her
breast
the
voices
in
the
back
of
the
house
had
ceased
from
the
kitchen
came
the
slipslop
of
tina
slovenly
feet
mary
gowd
opened
her
eyes
and
sat
up
very
straight
as
tina
stood
in
the
doorway
there
was
nothing
picturesque
about
tina
tina
was
not
one
of
those
daughters
of
italy
that
one
meets
in
fiction
looking
at
her
yellow
skin
and
her
wrinkles
and
her
coarse
hands
one
wondered
whether
she
was
fifty
or
sixty
or
one
hundred
as
is
the
way
with
italian
women
of
tina
class
at
ah
the
signora
was
tired
she
smiled
pityingly
tired
not
at
all
mary
gowd
assured
her
briskly
she
knew
that
tina
despised
her
because
she
worked
like
a
man
something
fine
for
supper
mary
gowd
asked
mockingly
her
italian
was
like
that
of
the
romans
themselves
so
soft
so
liquid
so
perfect
tina
nodded
vigorously
her
long
earrings
shaking
she
began
her
tongue
clinging
lovingly
to
the
double
sound
ugh
shuddered
mary
gowd
that
eternal
veal
and
mutton
pinkish
flabby
sickening
what
then
demanded
the
outraged
tina
mary
gowd
stood
up
making
gestures
hat
in
hand
clotted
cream
with
strawberries
she
said
in
english
an
unknown
language
which
always
roused
tina
to
fury
and
a
steak
a
real
steak
of
real
beef
three
inches
thick
and
covered
with
onions
fried
in
butter
and
creamed
chicken
and
english
hothouse
tomatoes
and
fresh
peaches
and
little
hot
rolls
and
coffee
that
is
licorice
and
ink
and
and
tina
dangling
earrings
disappeared
in
her
shoulders
her
outspread
palms
were
eloquent
crazy
these
english
said
the
shoulders
and
palms
mad
mary
gowd
threw
her
hat
on
the
bed
pushed
aside
a
screen
and
busied
herself
with
a
little
alcohol
stove
i
shall
prepare
an
omelet
she
said
over
her
shoulder
in
italian
also
i
have
here
bread
and
wine
ugh
granted
tina
ugh
veal
grunted
mary
gowd
then
as
tina
flapping
feet
turned
away
oh
tina
letters
tina
fumbled
at
the
bosom
of
her
gown
thought
deeply
and
drew
out
a
crumpled
envelope
it
had
been
opened
and
clumsily
closed
again
fifteen
years
ago
mary
gowd
would
have
raged
now
she
shrugged
philosophic
shoulders
tina
stole
hairpins
opened
letters
that
she
could
not
hope
to
decipher
rummaged
bureau
drawers
rifled
cupboards
and
fingered
books
but
then
so
did
most
of
the
other
tinas
in
rome
what
use
to
complain
mary
gowd
opened
the
letter
bringing
it
close
to
the
candlelight
as
she
read
a
smile
appeared
huh
gregg
she
said
americans
she
glanced
again
at
the
hotel
letterhead
on
the
stationery
the
best
hotel
in
naples
americans
and
rich
the
pleased
little
smile
lingered
as
she
beat
the
omelet
briskly
for
her
supper
the
henry
greggs
arrived
in
rome
on
the
two
train
from
naples
and
all
the
roman
knights
of
the
waving
palm
espied
them
from
afar
and
hailed
them
with
whoops
of
joy
the
season
was
still
young
and
the
henry
greggs
looked
like
money
not
italian
money
which
is
reckoned
in
lire
but
american
money
which
mounts
grandly
to
dollars
the
postcard
men
in
the
piazza
delle
terme
sped
after
their
motor
taxi
the
swarthy
brigand
with
his
wooden
box
of
tawdry
souvenirs
marked
them
as
they
rode
past
the
cripple
who
lurked
behind
a
pillar
in
the
colonnade
threw
aside
his
coat
with
a
practised
hitch
of
his
shoulder
to
reveal
the
sickeningly
maimed
arm
that
was
his
stock
in
trade
and
henry
gregg
had
left
their
comfortable
home
in
batavia
illinois
with
its
sleeping
porch
veranda
and
lawn
and
car
with
its
two
glistening
bathrooms
and
its
oriental
rugs
and
its
laundry
in
the
basement
and
its
sunday
fried
chicken
and
ice
cream
because
they
felt
that
miss
eleanora
gregg
ought
to
have
the
benefit
of
foreign
travel
miss
eleanora
gregg
thought
so
too
in
fact
she
had
thought
so
first
her
name
was
eleanora
but
her
parents
called
her
tweetie
which
really
did
not
sound
so
bad
as
it
might
if
tweetie
had
been
one
whit
less
pretty
tweetie
was
so
amazingly
americanly
pretty
that
she
could
have
triumphed
over
a
pet
name
twice
as
absurd
the
greggs
came
to
rome
as
has
been
stated
at
two
wednesday
by
two
thursday
tweetie
had
bought
a
pair
of
long
dangling
earrings
a
costume
with
a
roman
striped
collar
and
sash
and
had
learned
to
loll
back
in
her
cab
in
imitation
of
the
dashing
sallow
women
she
had
seen
driving
on
the
pincio
by
thursday
evening
she
was
teasing
papa
gregg
for
a
spray
of
white
aigrets
such
as
those
same
languorous
ladies
wore
in
feathery
mists
atop
their
hats
but
tweet
argued
papa
gregg
what
the
use
you
ca
take
them
back
with
you
regulations
forbid
it
the
rather
faded
but
smartly
dressed
gregg
asserted
herself
they
barbarous
we
had
moving
pictures
at
the
club
showing
how
they
torn
from
the
mother
birds
no
daughter
of
mine
i
do
care
retorted
tweetie
they
perfectly
stunning
and
going
to
have
them
and
she
had
them
not
that
the
aigret
incident
is
important
but
it
may
serve
to
place
the
greggs
in
their
respective
niches
at
eleven
friday
morning
mary
gowd
called
at
the
gregg
hotel
according
to
appointment
in
batavia
illinois
gregg
had
heard
of
mary
gowd
and
mary
gowd
with
her
knowledge
of
everything
roman
from
the
forum
to
the
best
place
at
which
to
buy
pearls
was
to
be
the
staff
on
which
the
greggs
were
to
lean
my
husband
said
gregg
my
daughter
twee
er
eleanora
heard
such
wonderful
things
of
you
from
my
dear
friend
melville
peters
of
batavia
ah
yes
exclaimed
mary
gowd
a
most
charming
person
mrs
peters
after
she
came
home
from
europe
she
read
the
most
wonderful
paper
on
rome
before
the
women
west
end
culture
club
of
batavia
affiliated
with
the
national
federation
of
women
clubs
as
you
probably
know
and
now
mother
interrupted
henry
gregg
the
lady
ca
be
interested
in
your
club
oh
but
i
am
exclaimed
mary
gowd
very
vivaciously
enormously
henry
gregg
eyed
her
through
his
cigar
smoke
with
suddenly
narrowed
lids
well
let
get
to
the
point
anyway
i
know
tweetie
here
is
dying
to
see
peter
and
all
that
tweetie
had
settled
back
inscrutably
after
one
comprehensive
disdainful
look
at
mary
gowd
suit
hat
gloves
and
shoes
now
she
sat
up
her
bewitching
face
glowing
with
interest
tell
me
she
said
what
do
they
call
those
officers
with
the
long
capes
and
the
silver
helmets
and
the
swords
and
the
ones
in
uniform
with
the
maroon
stripe
at
the
side
of
the
trousers
and
do
they
ever
mingle
with
the
that
is
there
was
one
of
the
blue
capes
here
at
tea
yesterday
papa
gregg
laughed
a
great
comfortable
laugh
oh
so
that
where
you
were
staring
yesterday
young
lady
i
thought
you
acted
kind
of
he
got
up
to
walk
over
and
pinch
tweetie
blushing
cheek
so
it
was
that
mary
gowd
began
the
process
of
pouring
the
bloody
religious
wanton
pious
thrilling
dreadful
history
of
rome
into
the
pretty
and
unheeding
ear
of
tweetie
gregg
on
the
fourth
morning
after
that
introductory
meeting
mary
gowd
arrived
at
the
hotel
at
ten
as
usual
to
take
charge
of
her
party
for
the
day
she
encountered
them
in
the
hotel
foyer
an
animated
little
group
centred
about
a
very
tall
very
dashing
very
figure
who
wore
a
long
pale
blue
cape
thrown
gracefully
over
one
shoulder
as
only
an
italian
officer
can
wear
such
a
garment
he
was
looking
down
into
the
brilliantly
glowing
face
of
the
pretty
eleanora
and
the
pretty
eleanora
was
looking
up
at
him
and
pa
and
ma
gregg
were
standing
by
placidly
pleased
a
grim
little
line
appeared
about
miss
gowd
mouth
blue
cape
black
eyes
saw
it
even
as
he
bent
low
over
mary
gowd
hand
at
the
words
of
introduction
oh
miss
gowd
pouted
tweetie
it
too
bad
you
have
a
telephone
you
see
we
sha
need
you
no
said
miss
gowd
and
glanced
at
blue
cape
no
signor
caldini
says
it
much
too
perfect
a
day
to
go
poking
about
among
old
ruins
and
things
henry
gregg
cleared
his
throat
and
took
up
the
explanation
seems
the
er
signor
thinks
it
would
be
just
the
thing
to
take
a
touring
car
and
drive
to
tivoli
and
have
a
bite
of
lunch
there
and
come
back
in
time
to
see
the
colosseum
by
moonlight
put
in
tweetie
ecstatically
oh
yes
said
mary
gowd
pa
gregg
looked
at
his
watch
well
i
be
running
along
he
said
then
in
answer
to
something
in
mary
gowd
eyes
i
not
going
to
tivoli
you
see
i
met
a
man
from
chicago
here
at
the
hotel
he
and
i
are
going
to
chin
awhile
this
morning
and
gregg
and
his
wife
are
going
on
a
shopping
spree
say
ma
if
you
need
any
more
money
speak
up
now
because
i
mary
gowd
caught
his
coat
sleeve
one
moment
her
voice
was
very
low
you
mean
you
mean
miss
eleanora
will
go
to
tivoli
and
to
the
colosseum
alone
with
with
signor
caldini
henry
gregg
smiled
indulgently
the
young
folks
always
run
round
alone
at
home
we
got
our
own
car
at
home
in
batavia
but
tweetie
beaus
are
always
driving
up
for
her
in
mary
gowd
turned
her
head
so
that
only
henry
gregg
could
hear
what
she
said
step
aside
for
just
one
moment
i
must
talk
to
you
well
what
do
as
i
say
whispered
mary
gowd
something
of
her
earnestness
seemed
to
convey
a
meaning
to
henry
gregg
just
wait
a
minute
folks
he
said
to
the
group
of
three
and
joined
mary
gowd
who
had
chosen
a
seat
a
dozen
paces
away
what
the
trouble
he
asked
jocularly
hope
you
not
offended
because
tweet
said
we
did
need
you
you
know
young
folks
they
must
not
go
alone
said
mary
gowd
but
this
is
not
america
this
is
italy
this
caldini
is
an
italian
why
look
here
signor
caldini
was
introduced
to
us
last
night
his
folks
really
belong
to
the
nobility
i
know
i
know
interrupted
mary
gowd
i
tell
you
they
can
not
go
alone
please
believe
me
i
have
been
fifteen
years
in
rome
noble
or
not
caldini
is
an
italian
i
ask
you
she
had
clasped
her
hands
and
was
looking
pleadingly
up
into
his
face
i
beg
of
you
let
me
go
with
them
you
need
not
pay
me
you
henry
gregg
looked
at
her
very
thoughtfully
and
a
little
puzzled
then
he
glanced
over
at
the
group
again
with
blue
cape
looking
down
so
eagerly
into
tweetie
exquisite
face
and
tweetie
looking
up
so
raptly
into
blue
cape
melting
eyes
and
ma
gregg
standing
so
placidly
by
he
turned
again
to
mary
gowd
earnest
face
well
maybe
you
right
they
do
seem
to
use
chaperons
in
europe
duennas
or
whatever
you
call
seems
a
nice
kind
of
chap
though
he
strolled
back
to
the
waiting
group
from
her
seat
mary
gowd
heard
gregg
surprised
exclamation
saw
tweetie
pout
understood
caldini
shrug
and
sneer
there
followed
a
little
burst
of
conversation
then
with
a
little
frown
which
melted
into
a
smile
for
blue
cape
tweetie
went
to
her
room
for
motor
coat
and
trifles
that
the
long
day
outing
demanded
gregg
still
voluble
followed
blue
cape
with
a
long
look
at
mary
gowd
went
out
to
confer
with
the
porter
about
the
motor
papa
gregg
hand
in
pockets
cigar
tilted
eyes
narrowed
stood
irresolutely
in
the
centre
of
the
great
gaudy
foyer
then
with
a
decisive
little
hunch
of
his
shoulders
he
came
back
to
where
mary
gowd
sat
did
you
say
you
been
fifteen
years
in
rome
fifteen
years
answered
mary
gowd
henry
gregg
took
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
regarded
it
thoughtfully
well
that
quite
a
spell
must
like
it
here
mary
gowd
said
nothing
ca
say
i
crazy
about
it
that
is
as
a
place
to
live
i
said
to
mother
last
night
old
batavia
good
enough
for
henry
of
course
it
a
grand
education
travelling
especially
for
tweetie
funny
i
always
thought
the
fruit
in
italy
was
regular
hothouse
stuff
thought
the
streets
would
just
be
lined
with
trees
all
hung
with
big
luscious
oranges
but
lord
here
we
are
at
the
best
hotel
in
rome
and
the
fruit
is
worse
than
the
stuff
the
pushcart
men
at
home
feed
to
their
families
little
wizened
bananas
and
oranges
still
it
grand
here
in
rome
for
tweetie
i
ca
stay
long
just
ran
away
from
business
to
bring
over
but
i
like
tweetie
to
stay
in
italy
until
she
learns
the
lingo
sings
too
tweetie
does
and
she
and
ma
think
have
her
voice
cultivated
over
here
they
stay
here
quite
a
while
i
guess
then
you
will
not
be
here
with
them
asked
mary
gowd
me
no
they
sat
silent
for
a
moment
i
suppose
you
crazy
about
rome
said
henry
gregg
again
there
a
lot
of
culture
here
and
history
and
all
that
and
i
hate
rome
said
mary
gowd
henry
gregg
stared
at
her
in
bewilderment
then
why
in
sam
hill
do
you
go
back
to
england
i
years
old
that
one
reason
why
and
i
look
older
oh
yes
i
do
thanks
just
the
same
there
are
too
many
women
in
england
already
too
many
shabby
genteel
i
earn
enough
to
live
on
here
that
is
i
call
it
living
you
could
in
the
bad
season
when
there
are
no
tourists
i
live
on
a
lire
a
day
including
my
rent
henry
gregg
stood
up
my
land
why
do
you
come
to
america
he
waved
his
arms
america
mary
gowd
cheeks
grew
redder
america
she
echoed
when
i
see
american
tourists
here
throwing
pennies
in
the
fountain
of
trevi
so
that
they
come
back
to
rome
i
want
to
scream
by
the
time
i
save
enough
money
to
go
to
america
i
be
an
old
woman
and
it
will
be
too
late
and
if
i
did
contrive
to
scrape
together
enough
for
my
passage
over
i
could
go
to
the
united
states
in
these
clothes
i
seen
thousands
of
american
women
here
if
they
look
like
that
when
they
just
travelling
about
what
do
they
wear
at
home
clothes
inquired
henry
gregg
mystified
what
wrong
with
your
clothes
everything
i
seen
them
look
at
my
suit
which
hunches
in
the
back
and
strains
across
the
front
and
is
shiny
at
the
seams
and
my
gloves
and
my
hat
well
even
though
i
am
english
i
know
how
frightful
my
hat
is
you
a
smart
woman
said
henry
gregg
not
smart
enough
retorted
mary
gowd
or
i
should
be
here
the
two
stood
up
as
tweetie
came
toward
them
from
the
lift
tweetie
pouted
again
at
sight
of
mary
gowd
but
the
pout
cleared
as
blue
cape
his
arrangements
completed
stood
in
the
doorway
splendid
hat
in
hand
it
was
ten
when
the
three
returned
from
tivoli
and
the
colosseum
mary
gowd
silent
and
shabbier
than
ever
from
the
dust
of
the
road
blue
cape
smiling
tweetie
frankly
pettish
pa
and
ma
gregg
were
listening
to
the
concert
in
the
foyer
was
it
romantic
the
colosseum
i
mean
by
moonlight
asked
ma
gregg
patting
tweetie
cheek
and
trying
not
to
look
uncomfortable
as
blue
cape
kissed
her
hand
romantic
snapped
tweetie
it
was
as
romantic
as
main
street
on
circus
day
hordes
of
people
tramping
about
like
buffaloes
simply
swarming
with
tourists
german
ones
one
could
find
a
single
ruin
to
sit
on
romantic
she
glared
at
the
silent
mary
gowd
there
was
a
strange
little
glint
in
mary
gowd
eyes
and
the
grim
line
was
there
about
the
mouth
again
grimmer
than
it
had
been
in
the
morning
you
will
excuse
me
she
said
i
am
very
tired
i
will
say
good
night
and
i
announced
caldini
mary
gowd
turned
swiftly
to
look
at
him
you
said
tweetie
gregg
i
trust
that
i
may
have
the
very
great
happiness
to
see
you
in
the
morning
went
on
caldini
in
his
careful
english
i
can
not
permit
signora
gowd
to
return
home
alone
through
the
streets
of
rome
he
bowed
low
and
elaborately
over
the
hands
of
the
two
women
oh
well
for
that
matter
began
henry
gregg
gallantly
caldini
raised
a
protesting
hand
i
can
not
permit
it
he
bowed
again
and
looked
hard
at
mary
gowd
mary
gowd
returned
the
look
the
had
quite
faded
from
her
cheeks
then
with
a
nod
she
turned
and
walked
toward
the
door
blue
cape
sword
clanking
followed
her
in
silence
he
handed
her
into
the
in
silence
he
seated
himself
beside
her
then
he
leaned
very
close
i
will
talk
in
this
damned
english
he
began
that
the
pig
of
a
may
not
understand
this
this
gregg
he
is
very
rich
like
all
americans
and
the
little
eleanora
you
must
not
stand
in
my
way
it
is
not
good
mary
dowd
sat
silent
you
will
help
me
you
were
not
kind
there
will
be
much
money
money
for
me
also
for
you
fifteen
years
before
ten
years
before
she
would
have
died
sooner
than
listen
to
a
plan
such
as
he
proposed
but
fifteen
years
of
rome
blunts
one
english
sensibilities
fifteen
years
of
privation
dulls
moral
sense
and
money
meant
america
and
little
tweetie
gregg
had
not
lowered
her
voice
or
her
laugh
when
she
spoke
that
afternoon
of
mary
gowd
absurd
english
fringe
and
her
red
wrists
above
her
gloves
how
much
asked
mary
gowd
he
named
a
figure
she
laughed
more
much
more
he
named
another
figure
then
another
you
will
put
it
down
on
paper
said
mary
gowd
and
sign
your
name
they
drove
the
remainder
of
the
way
in
silence
at
her
door
in
the
via
babbuino
you
mean
to
marry
her
asked
mary
gowd
blue
cape
shrugged
eloquent
shoulders
i
think
not
he
said
quite
simply
it
was
to
be
the
appian
way
the
next
morning
with
a
stop
at
the
catacombs
mary
gowd
reached
the
hotel
very
early
but
not
so
early
as
caldini
think
the
five
of
us
can
pile
into
one
carriage
boomed
henry
gregg
cheerily
a
little
crowded
i
think
said
mary
gowd
for
such
a
long
drive
may
i
suggest
that
we
three
she
smiled
on
henry
gregg
and
his
wife
take
this
larger
carriage
while
miss
eleanora
and
signor
caldini
follow
in
the
single
cab
a
lightning
message
from
blue
cape
eyes
yes
that
would
be
nice
cooed
tweetie
so
it
was
arranged
mary
gowd
rather
outdid
herself
as
a
guide
that
morning
she
had
a
hundred
little
intimate
tales
at
her
tongue
end
she
seemed
fairly
to
people
those
old
ruins
again
with
the
men
and
women
of
a
thousand
years
ago
even
tweetie
little
frivolous
indifferent
tweetie
was
impressed
and
interested
as
they
were
returning
to
the
carriages
after
inspecting
the
baths
of
caracalla
tweetie
even
skipped
ahead
and
slipped
her
hand
for
a
moment
into
mary
gowd
you
simply
wonderful
she
said
almost
shyly
you
make
things
sound
so
real
and
and
i
sorry
i
was
so
nasty
to
you
yesterday
at
tivoli
mary
dowd
looked
down
at
the
glowing
little
face
a
foolish
little
face
it
was
but
very
very
pretty
and
exquisitely
young
and
fresh
and
sweet
tweetie
dropped
her
voice
to
a
whisper
you
should
hear
him
pronounce
my
name
it
is
like
music
when
he
says
it
like
that
and
are
his
kid
gloves
always
beautifully
white
why
the
boys
back
home
mary
gowd
was
still
staring
down
at
her
she
lifted
the
slim
ringed
little
hand
which
lay
within
her
paw
and
stared
at
that
too
then
with
a
jerk
she
dropped
the
girl
hand
and
squared
her
shoulders
like
a
soldier
so
that
the
dowdy
blue
suit
strained
more
than
ever
at
its
seams
and
the
line
that
had
settled
about
her
mouth
the
night
before
faded
slowly
as
though
a
muscle
too
tightly
drawn
had
relaxed
in
the
carriages
they
were
seated
as
before
the
horses
started
up
with
the
smaller
cab
but
a
dozen
paces
behind
mary
gowd
leaned
forward
she
began
to
speak
her
voice
very
low
her
accent
clearly
english
her
brevity
wonderfully
american
listen
to
me
she
said
you
must
leave
rome
leave
rome
echoed
the
greggs
as
though
rehearsing
a
duet
be
quiet
you
must
not
shout
like
that
i
say
you
must
go
away
mamma
gregg
opened
her
lips
and
shut
them
wordless
for
once
henry
gregg
laid
one
big
hand
on
his
wife
shaking
knees
and
eyed
mary
gowd
very
quietly
i
do
get
you
he
said
mary
gowd
looked
straight
at
him
as
she
said
what
she
had
to
say
there
are
things
in
rome
you
can
not
understand
you
could
not
understand
unless
you
lived
here
many
years
i
lived
here
many
months
before
i
learned
to
step
meekly
off
into
the
gutter
to
allow
a
man
to
pass
on
the
narrow
sidewalk
you
must
take
your
pretty
daughter
and
go
away
no
let
me
finish
i
will
tell
you
what
happened
to
me
fifteen
years
ago
and
i
will
tell
you
what
this
caldini
has
in
his
mind
you
will
believe
me
and
forgive
me
and
promise
me
that
you
will
go
quietly
away
when
she
finished
gregg
was
and
luckily
too
frightened
to
weep
henry
gregg
started
up
in
the
carriage
his
fists
his
lean
face
turned
toward
the
carriage
crawling
behind
sit
down
commanded
mary
gowd
she
jerked
his
sleeve
sit
down
henry
gregg
sat
down
slowly
then
he
wet
his
lips
slightly
and
smiled
oh
bosh
he
said
this
this
is
the
twentieth
century
and
americans
and
it
broad
daylight
why
i
lick
the
this
is
rome
interrupted
mary
gowd
quietly
and
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
because
he
would
make
you
pay
for
that
too
and
it
would
be
in
all
the
papers
and
your
pretty
daughter
would
hang
her
head
in
shame
forever
she
put
one
hand
on
henry
gregg
sleeve
you
do
not
know
you
do
not
promise
me
you
will
go
the
tears
sprang
suddenly
to
her
english
blue
eyes
promise
me
promise
me
henry
cried
mamma
gregg
very
promise
henry
i
promise
said
henry
gregg
and
he
turned
away
mary
gowd
sank
back
in
her
seat
and
shut
her
eyes
for
a
moment
she
said
to
the
driver
then
she
waved
a
gay
hand
at
the
carriage
in
the
rear
she
called
smiling
at
six
mary
gowd
entered
the
little
room
in
the
via
babbuino
she
went
first
to
the
window
drew
the
heavy
curtains
the
roar
of
rome
was
hushed
to
a
humming
she
lighted
a
candle
that
stood
on
the
table
its
dim
light
emphasized
the
gloom
she
took
off
the
battered
black
velvet
hat
and
sank
into
the
english
chair
tina
stood
in
the
doorway
mary
gowd
sat
up
with
a
jerk
letters
tina
tina
thought
deeply
fumbled
at
the
bosom
of
her
gown
and
drew
out
a
sealed
envelope
grudgingly
mary
gowd
broke
the
seal
glanced
at
the
letter
then
under
startled
gaze
she
held
it
to
the
flaming
candle
and
watched
it
burn
what
is
it
that
you
do
demanded
tina
mary
gowd
smiled
you
have
heard
of
america
america
a
thousand
a
million
time
my
brother
luigi
naturally
this
then
mary
gowd
deliberately
gathered
up
the
ashes
into
a
neat
pile
and
held
them
in
her
hand
a
crumpled
heap
this
then
tina
is
my
trip
to
america
x
the
key
to
the
heart
of
paris
is
love
he
whose
lacks
that
open
sesame
never
really
sees
the
city
even
though
he
dwell
in
the
shadow
of
the
sorbonne
and
comprehend
the
french
of
the
paris
cabman
some
there
are
who
craftily
open
the
door
with
a
skeleton
key
some
who
ruthlessly
batter
the
panels
some
who
achieve
only
a
wax
impression
which
proves
to
be
useless
there
are
many
who
travel
no
farther
than
the
outer
gates
you
will
find
them
staring
blankly
at
the
stone
walls
and
their
plaint
is
what
do
they
find
to
rave
about
in
this
town
sophy
gold
had
been
eight
days
in
paris
and
she
had
not
so
much
as
peeked
through
the
in
a
vague
way
she
realised
that
she
was
seeing
paris
as
a
blind
man
sees
the
sun
feeling
its
warmth
conscious
of
its
white
light
beating
on
the
eyeballs
but
never
actually
beholding
its
golden
glory
this
was
sophy
gold
first
trip
to
paris
and
her
heart
and
soul
and
business
brain
were
intent
on
buying
the
shrewdest
possible
bill
of
lingerie
and
infants
wear
for
her
department
at
schiff
brothers
chicago
but
sophy
the
powers
of
those
three
guiding
parts
while
heart
soul
and
brain
were
bent
dutifully
and
indefatigably
on
the
lingerie
and
job
they
also
were
registering
a
series
of
kaleidoscopic
outside
impressions
as
she
drove
from
her
hotel
to
the
wholesale
district
and
from
the
wholesale
district
to
her
hotel
there
had
flashed
across
her
consciousness
the
picture
of
the
chic
little
modistes
models
and
slipping
out
at
noon
to
meet
their
lovers
on
the
corner
to
sit
over
their
or
wine
at
some
little
caf√©
hands
clasped
eyes
glowing
stepping
out
of
the
lift
to
ask
for
her
room
key
she
had
come
on
the
floor
clerk
deep
in
murmured
conversation
with
the
valet
and
she
had
seemed
not
to
see
sophy
at
all
as
she
groped
subconsciously
for
the
key
along
the
rows
of
keyboxes
she
had
seen
the
workmen
in
their
absurdly
baggy
corduroy
trousers
and
grimy
shirts
strolling
along
arm
in
arm
with
the
women
of
their
class
those
untidy
women
with
the
tidy
hair
bareheaded
and
happy
they
strolled
along
a
strange
contrast
to
the
glitter
of
the
fashionable
boulevard
stopping
now
and
then
to
gaze
at
a
necklace
in
a
jeweller
window
then
on
again
with
a
laugh
and
a
shrug
and
a
caress
she
had
seen
the
silent
couples
in
the
tuileries
gardens
at
twilight
once
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
a
slim
sallow
had
bent
for
what
seemed
an
interminable
time
over
a
white
hand
that
was
stretched
from
the
window
of
a
motor
car
he
was
standing
at
the
curb
in
either
greeting
or
parting
and
his
eyes
were
fastened
on
other
eyes
within
the
car
even
while
his
lips
pressed
the
white
hand
then
one
evening
sophy
reddened
now
at
memory
of
it
she
had
turned
a
quiet
corner
and
come
on
a
boy
and
a
girl
the
girl
was
shabby
and
sixteen
the
boy
pale
voluble
smiling
evidently
they
were
just
parting
suddenly
as
she
passed
the
boy
had
caught
the
girl
in
his
arms
there
on
the
street
corner
in
the
daylight
and
had
kissed
her
not
the
quick
resounding
smack
of
casual
but
a
long
silent
kiss
that
left
the
girl
limp
sophy
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
between
horror
and
fascination
the
boy
arm
brought
the
girl
upright
and
set
her
on
her
feet
she
took
a
long
breath
straightened
her
hat
and
ran
on
to
rejoin
her
girl
friend
awaiting
her
calmly
up
the
street
she
was
not
even
flushed
but
sophy
was
sophy
was
blushing
hotly
and
burning
uncomfortably
so
that
her
eyes
smarted
just
after
her
late
dinner
on
the
eighth
day
of
her
paris
stay
sophy
gold
was
seated
in
the
hotel
lobby
paris
thronged
with
american
business
buyers
those
clever
capable
women
who
swarm
on
the
city
in
june
and
strip
it
of
its
choicest
flowers
from
ball
gowns
to
back
combs
sophy
tried
to
pick
them
from
the
multitude
that
swept
past
her
it
was
not
difficult
the
women
visitors
to
paris
in
june
drop
easily
into
their
proper
slots
there
were
the
pretty
american
girls
and
their
marvellously
mammas
both
the
french
in
their
efforts
to
look
parisian
there
were
rows
of
fat
placid
argentine
mothers
each
with
a
watchful
eye
on
her
volcanically
calm
daughter
and
there
were
the
buyers
miraculously
dressy
in
next
week
styles
in
suits
and
hats
of
the
type
most
of
them
alert
capable
they
usually
returned
to
their
hotels
at
six
limping
a
little
but
at
sight
of
the
brightly
lighted
gay
hotel
foyer
they
would
straighten
up
like
scenting
battle
and
achieve
an
effective
entrance
from
the
doorway
to
the
lift
in
all
that
big
busy
foyer
sophy
gold
herself
was
the
one
person
distinctly
out
of
the
picture
one
did
not
know
where
to
place
her
to
begin
with
a
woman
as
irrevocably
irredeemably
ugly
as
sophy
was
an
anachronism
in
paris
she
belonged
to
the
gargoyle
period
you
found
yourself
speculating
on
whether
it
was
her
mouth
or
her
nose
that
made
her
so
devastatingly
plain
only
to
bring
up
at
her
eyes
and
find
that
they
alone
were
enough
to
wreck
any
ambitions
toward
beauty
you
knew
before
you
saw
it
that
her
hair
would
be
limp
and
straggling
you
sensed
without
a
glance
at
them
that
her
hands
would
be
bony
with
unlovely
knuckles
the
fates
grinning
had
done
all
that
her
chicago
tailor
and
milliner
had
completed
the
work
sophy
had
not
been
in
paris
ten
minutes
before
she
noticed
that
they
were
wearing
long
and
full
her
coat
was
short
and
her
skirt
scant
her
hat
was
small
the
paris
windows
were
full
of
large
and
graceful
black
velvets
of
the
lillian
russell
school
may
i
sit
here
sophy
looked
up
into
the
plump
pink
smiling
face
of
one
of
those
very
women
of
the
buyer
type
on
whom
she
had
speculated
ten
minutes
before
a
face
with
shrewd
twinkling
eyes
at
sight
of
it
you
forgave
her
her
skittish
shoes
certainly
smiled
sophy
and
moved
over
a
bit
on
the
little
french
settee
the
plump
woman
sat
down
heavily
in
five
minutes
sophy
was
conscious
she
was
being
stared
at
surreptitiously
in
ten
minutes
she
was
uncomfortably
conscious
of
it
in
eleven
minutes
she
turned
her
head
suddenly
and
caught
the
stout
woman
eyes
fixed
on
her
with
just
the
baffled
speculative
expression
she
had
expected
to
find
in
them
sophy
gold
had
caught
that
look
in
many
women
eyes
she
smiled
grimly
now
do
try
it
she
said
it
no
use
the
pink
plump
face
flushed
pinker
do
try
do
try
to
convince
yourself
that
if
i
wore
my
hair
differently
or
my
collar
tighter
or
my
hat
larger
it
would
make
a
difference
in
my
looks
it
would
it
hard
to
believe
that
i
as
homely
as
i
look
but
i
am
i
watched
women
try
to
dress
me
in
as
many
as
eleven
mental
changes
of
costume
before
they
gave
me
up
but
i
did
mean
i
beg
your
pardon
you
must
think
oh
that
all
right
i
used
to
struggle
but
i
used
to
it
now
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
realise
that
this
was
my
real
face
and
the
only
kind
i
could
ever
expect
to
have
the
plump
woman
kindly
face
grew
kinder
but
you
really
not
so
oh
yes
i
am
upholstering
ca
change
me
there
are
various
kinds
of
homely
women
some
who
are
hideous
in
blue
maybe
but
who
soften
up
in
pink
then
there
the
one
you
read
about
whose
features
are
lighted
up
now
and
then
by
one
of
those
rare
sweet
smiles
that
make
her
plain
face
almost
beautiful
but
once
in
a
while
you
find
a
woman
who
is
ugly
in
any
colour
of
the
rainbow
who
is
ugly
smiling
or
serious
talking
or
in
repose
hair
down
low
or
hair
done
high
just
plain
homely
i
that
kind
here
for
a
visit
i
a
buyer
said
the
plump
woman
yes
i
thought
so
i
the
lingerie
and
buyer
for
schiff
chicago
a
buyer
the
plump
woman
eyes
jumped
uncontrollably
again
to
sophy
gold
scrambled
features
well
my
name
miss
morrissey
ella
morrissey
millinery
for
abelman
pittsburgh
and
it
no
snap
this
year
with
the
shops
showing
hats
one
day
and
the
next
i
said
this
morning
that
i
envied
the
head
of
the
tinware
department
been
over
often
sophy
made
the
shamefaced
confession
of
the
novice
my
first
trip
the
inevitable
answer
came
your
first
really
this
is
my
twentieth
crossing
been
coming
over
twice
a
year
for
ten
years
if
there
anything
i
can
tell
you
just
ask
the
first
buying
trip
to
paris
is
hard
until
you
know
the
ropes
of
course
you
love
this
town
sophy
gold
sat
silent
a
moment
hesitating
then
she
turned
a
puzzled
face
toward
miss
morrissey
what
do
people
mean
when
they
say
they
love
paris
ella
morrissey
stared
then
a
queer
look
came
into
her
face
a
pitying
sort
of
look
the
shrewd
eyes
softened
she
groped
for
words
when
i
first
came
over
here
ten
years
ago
i
well
it
would
have
been
easier
to
tell
you
then
i
do
know
there
something
about
paris
something
in
the
atmosphere
something
in
the
air
it
it
makes
you
do
foolish
things
it
makes
you
feel
queer
and
light
and
happy
nothing
you
can
put
your
finger
on
and
say
it
but
it
there
huh
grunted
sophy
gold
i
suppose
i
could
save
myself
a
lot
of
trouble
by
saying
that
i
feel
it
but
i
do
i
simply
do
react
to
this
town
the
only
things
i
really
like
in
paris
are
the
tomb
of
napoleon
the
seine
at
night
and
the
strawberry
tart
you
get
at
vian
of
course
the
parks
and
boulevards
are
a
marvel
but
you
ca
expect
me
to
love
a
town
for
that
i
no
landscape
gardener
that
pitying
look
deepened
in
miss
morrissey
eyes
have
you
been
out
in
the
evening
the
restaurants
the
french
women
the
life
sophy
gold
caught
the
pitying
look
and
interpreted
it
without
resentment
but
there
was
perhaps
an
added
acid
in
her
tone
when
she
spoke
i
here
to
buy
not
to
play
i
thirty
years
old
and
it
taken
me
ten
years
to
work
my
way
up
to
foreign
buyer
i
worked
and
i
handicapped
any
by
my
beauty
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
going
to
buy
the
line
of
french
lingerie
and
infants
wear
that
schiff
brothers
ever
had
miss
morrissey
checked
her
but
my
dear
girl
have
you
been
round
at
all
oh
a
little
as
much
as
a
woman
can
go
round
alone
in
paris
even
a
homely
woman
but
i
been
disappointed
every
time
the
noise
drives
me
wild
to
begin
with
not
that
i
not
used
to
noise
i
am
i
can
stand
for
a
town
that
roars
like
chicago
but
this
city
yelps
i
been
going
round
to
the
restaurants
a
little
at
noon
i
always
picked
the
restaurant
i
wanted
so
long
as
i
had
to
pay
for
the
lunch
of
the
who
was
with
me
anyway
can
you
imagine
any
man
at
home
letting
a
woman
pay
for
his
meals
the
way
those
shrimpy
frenchmen
do
well
the
restaurants
were
always
jammed
full
of
americans
the
men
of
the
party
would
look
over
the
french
menu
in
a
helpless
sort
of
way
and
then
they
say
do
you
say
to
a
nice
big
steak
with
potatoes
the
waiter
would
give
them
a
disgusted
look
and
put
in
the
order
they
might
just
as
well
have
been
eating
at
a
quick
lunch
place
as
for
the
french
women
every
time
i
picked
what
i
took
to
be
a
real
parisienne
coming
toward
me
i
hear
her
say
as
she
passed
going
over
to
the
galerie
lafayette
i
meet
you
at
the
american
express
at
twelve
and
henry
i
think
i
need
some
more
money
miss
ella
morrissey
twinkling
eyes
almost
disappeared
in
wrinkles
of
laughter
but
sophy
gold
was
not
laughing
as
she
talked
she
gazed
grimly
ahead
at
the
throng
that
shifted
and
glittered
and
laughed
and
chattered
all
about
her
i
stopped
work
early
one
afternoon
and
went
over
across
the
river
well
they
may
be
artistic
but
they
all
looked
as
though
they
needed
a
shave
and
a
and
a
square
meal
and
the
girls
ella
morrissey
raised
a
plump
protesting
palm
now
look
here
child
paris
is
so
much
a
city
as
a
state
of
mind
to
enjoy
it
you
got
to
forget
you
an
american
do
look
at
it
from
a
chicago
illinois
viewpoint
just
try
to
imagine
you
a
mixture
of
montmartre
girl
latin
quarter
model
and
duchess
from
the
champs
√©lys√©es
then
you
get
it
get
it
retorted
sophy
gold
if
i
could
do
that
i
would
be
buying
lingerie
and
infants
wear
for
schiffs
i
be
crowding
duse
and
bernhardt
and
fiske
off
the
boards
miss
morrissey
sat
silent
and
thoughtful
rubbing
one
fat
forefinger
slowly
up
and
down
her
knee
suddenly
she
turned
do
be
angry
but
have
you
ever
been
in
love
look
at
me
replied
sophy
gold
simply
miss
morrissey
reddened
a
little
as
head
of
the
lingerie
section
i
selected
trousseaus
for
i
do
know
how
many
chicago
brides
but
i
never
have
to
decide
whether
i
have
pink
or
blue
ribbons
for
my
own
with
a
little
impulsive
gesture
ella
morrissey
laid
one
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
her
new
acquaintance
come
on
up
and
visit
me
will
you
i
made
them
give
me
an
inside
room
away
from
the
noise
too
many
people
down
here
besides
i
like
to
take
off
this
of
mine
and
get
comfortable
when
a
girl
gets
as
old
and
fat
as
i
am
there
are
some
letters
i
ought
to
get
out
sophy
gold
protested
feebly
yes
i
know
we
all
have
but
there
such
a
thing
as
overdoing
this
duty
to
the
firm
you
get
up
at
six
morning
and
slap
off
those
letters
they
come
easier
and
sound
less
tired
they
made
for
the
lift
but
at
its
very
gates
hello
little
girl
cried
a
masculine
voice
and
a
detaining
hand
was
laid
on
ella
morrissey
plump
shoulder
that
lady
recognised
the
voice
and
the
greeting
before
she
turned
to
face
their
source
max

junior
partner
in
the
firm

too
cordially

he
was
undeniably
dressy
not
that
only
but
radiant
with
the
born
of
good
looks
of
evening
clothes
of
a
fresh
shave
of
glistening
nails
max
tack
of
the
hard
eye
and
the
soft
smile
of
the
slim
figure
and
the
head
of
the
flattering
tongue
and
the
business
brain
bent
his
attention
full
on
the
very
plain
miss
sophy
gold

to
introduce

demanded
miss
morrissey

day

evening
max
tack
always
called
a
woman
little
one
it
was
part
of
his
business
formula
he
was
only
one
of
the
wholesalers
who
go
to
paris
yearly
ostensibly
to
buy
models
but
really
to
pay
heavy
diplomatic
court
to
those
hundreds
of
women
buyers
who
flock
to
that
city
in
the
interests
of
their
firms
to
entertain
those
buyers
who
were
interested
in
goods
such
as
he
manufactured
in
america
to
win
their
friendship
to
make
them
feel
under
obligation
at
least
to
inspect
his
line
when
they
came
to
new
york
that
was
max
tack
mission
in
paris
he
performed
it
admirably
what
evening
he
said
now
how
about
sophy
gold
shook
her
head
wednesday
then
you
stick
to
me
and
you
see
paris
thursday
i
buying
my
own
dinners
said
sophy
gold
max
tack
wagged
a
chiding
forefinger
at
her
you
little
rascal
no
one
had
ever
called
sophy
gold
a
little
rascal
before
you
stingy
little
rascal
wo
give
a
poor
lonesome
fellow
an
evening
pleasure
eh
the
theatre
want
to
go
slumming
he
was
feeling
his
way
now
a
trifle
puzzled
usually
he
landed
a
buyer
at
the
first
shot
of
course
you
had
to
use
tact
and
discrimination
some
you
took
to
supper
and
to
the
naughty
occasionally
you
found
a
highbrow
one
who
preferred
the
opera
had
he
not
sat
through
parsifal
the
week
before
and
nearly
died
some
wanted
to
begin
at
tod
sloan
bar
and
work
their
way
up
through
montmartre
ending
with
breakfast
at
the
pr√©
catalan
those
were
the
greedy
ones
but
this
one
what
she
stalling
for
with
that
face
he
asked
himself
sophy
gold
was
moving
toward
the
lift
the
miss
morrissey
with
her
i
working
too
hard
to
play
thanks
just
the
same
max
tack
his
face
blank
stood
staring
up
at
them
as
the
lift
began
to
ascend
said
miss
morrissey
grandly
to
the
lift
man
third
replied
that
linguistic
person
unimpressed
it
turned
out
to
be
soothingly
quiet
and
cool
in
ella
morrissey
room
she
flicked
on
the
light
and
turned
an
admiring
glance
on
sophy
gold
is
that
your
usual
method
i
have
any
method
miss
gold
seated
herself
by
the
window
but
i
worked
too
hard
for
this
job
of
mine
to
risk
it
by
putting
myself
under
obligations
to
any
new
york
firm
it
simply
means
that
you
got
to
buy
their
goods
it
is
fair
to
your
firm
miss
morrissey
was
busy
with
hooks
and
eyes
and
strings
her
utterance
was
jerky
but
concise
at
one
stage
of
her
disrobing
she
breathed
a
great
sigh
of
relief
as
she
flung
a
heavy
garment
from
her
there
that
comfort
nights
like
this
i
wish
i
had
that
back
porch
of
our
flat
to
sit
on
for
just
an
hour
ma
has
flower
boxes
all
round
it
and
i
bought
one
of
those
hammock
couches
last
year
when
i
come
home
from
the
store
summer
evenings
i
peel
and
get
into
my
old
kimono
and
lie
there
listening
to
the
girl
stirring
the
iced
tea
for
supper
and
knowing
that
ma
has
a
platter
of
her
swell
cold
fish
with
egg
sauce
she
relaxed
into
an
armchair
tell
me
do
you
always
talk
to
men
that
way
sophy
gold
was
still
staring
out
the
open
window
they
do
bother
me
much
as
a
rule
max
tack
is
a
bad
boy
he
never
wastes
much
time
on
me
i
do
buy
his
line
max
is
all
business
of
course
he
something
of
a
smarty
and
he
does
think
he
the
first
verse
and
chorus
of
but
you
ca
help
liking
him
well
i
can
said
sophy
gold
and
her
voice
was
a
little
bitter
and
without
half
trying
oh
i
do
say
you
were
right
i
always
made
it
a
rule
to
steer
clear
of
the
myself
there
are
plenty
of
girls
who
take
everything
they
can
get
i
know
that
max
tack
is
just
padded
with
letters
from
old
girls
beginning
kid
and
ending
with
a
world
of
love
i
do
believe
in
that
kind
of
thing
or
in
accepting
things
julia
harris
who
buys
for
three
departments
in
our
store
drives
up
every
morning
in
the
french
car
that
parmentier
gave
her
when
she
was
here
last
year
that
bad
principle
and
poor
taste
but
well
you
young
and
there
ought
to
be
something
besides
business
in
your
life
sophy
gold
turned
her
face
from
the
window
toward
miss
morrissey
it
served
to
put
a
stamp
of
finality
on
what
she
said
there
never
will
be
i
do
know
anything
but
business
it
the
only
thing
i
care
about
i
be
earning
my
ten
thousand
a
year
pretty
soon
ten
thousand
a
year
is
a
lot
but
it
is
everything
oh
no
it
is
look
here
dear
nobody
knows
better
than
i
how
this
working
and
being
independent
and
earning
your
own
good
money
puts
the
stopper
on
any
sentiment
a
girl
might
have
in
her
but
do
let
it
sour
you
you
lose
your
illusions
soon
enough
goodness
knows
there
no
use
in
smashing
out
of
pure
meanness
i
do
see
what
illusions
have
got
to
do
with
max
tack
interrupted
sophy
gold
miss
morrissey
laughed
her
fat
comfortable
chuckle
i
suppose
you
right
and
i
guess
i
been
getting
a
bit
nosey
but
i
pretty
nearly
old
enough
to
be
your
mother
the
girls
kind
of
come
to
me
and
i
talk
to
i
guess
they
spoiled
me
they
there
came
a
smart
rapping
at
the
door
followed
by
certain
giggling
and
swishing
miss
morrissey
smiled
that
be
some
of
now
just
run
and
open
the
door
will
you
like
a
nice
little
thing
i
too
beat
out
to
move
the
swishing
swelled
to
a
mighty
rustle
as
the
door
opened
taffeta
was
good
this
year
and
the
three
who
entered
were
the
last
in
the
world
to
leave
you
in
ignorance
of
that
fact
ella
morrissey
presented
her
new
friend
to
the
three
giving
the
department
each
represented
as
one
would
mention
a
title
or
order
the
little
plump
one
in
black
ladies
and
misses

portland
that
a
pretty
hat
carrie
get
it
give
me
a
big
black
velvet
every
time
you
can
wear
with
anything
and
yet
they
dressy
too
just
now
small
hats
are
distinctly
passy
the
handsome
one
who
dressed
the
way
you
always
imagined
the
parisiennes
would
dress
but
do
fancy
goods
stein
stack
san
francisco
listen
fan
do
go
back
to
san
francisco
with
that
stuff
on
your
lips
it
all
right
in
paris
where
all
the
women
do
it
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
morry
stein
would
take
one
look
at
you
and
then
tell
you
to
go
upstairs
and
wash
your
face
well
i
just
telling
you
as
a
friend
that
little
trick
is
the
biggest
lace
buyer
in
the
country
no
you
would
would
you
such
a
mite
even
if
she
does
wear
a
blouse
she
got
a
brain
have
you
belle
you
did
make
a
mistake
with
that
blue
cr√™pe
de
chine
child
it
chic
and
yet
girlish
and
you
can
wear
it
on
the
floor
too
when
you
get
home
quiet
if
it
is
stunning
these
five
as
they
sat
there
that
june
evening
knew
what
your
wife
and
your
sister
and
your
mother
would
wear
on
fifth
avenue
or
michigan
avenue
next
october
on
their
shrewd
unerring
judgment
rested
the
success
or
failure
of
many
hundreds
of
feminine
garments
the
lace
for
miss
minnesota
lingerie
the
jewelled
comb
in
miss
colorado
hair
the
hat
that
would
grace
miss
new
hampshire
the
dress
for
madam
delaware
all
were
the
results
of
their
farsighted
selection
they
were
foragers
of
feminine
and
their
booty
would
be
distributed
from
oyster
cove
to
orange
grove
they
were
marcelled
and
manicured
within
an
inch
of
their
lives
they
rustled
and
a
pleasant
perfume
clung
about
them
their
hats
were
so
smart
that
they
gave
you
a
shock
their
shoes
were
correct
their
skirts
bunched
where
skirts
should
bunch
that
year
or
lay
smooth
where
smoothness
was
decreed
they
looked
like
the
essence
of
frivolity
until
you
saw
their
eyes
and
then
you
noticed
that
that
which
is
liquid
in
sheltered
women
eyes
was
crystallised
in
theirs
sophy
gold
listening
to
them
felt
strangely
out
of
it
and
plainer
than
ever
i
taking
tango
lessons
ella
chirped
miss
laces
every
time
i
went
to
new
york
last
year
i
sat
and
twiddled
my
thumbs
while
every
one
else
was
dancing
i
made
up
my
mind
i
be
in
it
this
year
you
girls
are
wonders
miss
morrissey
marvelled
i
ca
do
it
any
more
if
i
was
to
work
as
hard
as
i
have
to
during
the
day
and
then
run
round
the
way
you
do
in
the
evening
they
have
to
hold
services
for
me
at
sea
i
getting
old
you
old
this
from
miss
you
younger
now
than
ever
be
oh
ella
i
got
six
stunning
models
at
estelle
mornet
there
a
business
woman
for
you
her
place
is
smart
from
the
ground
floor
up
not
like
the
shabby
old
junk
shops
the
others
have
and
she
greets
you
herself
the
personal
touch
let
me
tell
you
it
counts
in
business
i
go
slow
on
those
cape
blouses
if
i
were
you
i
do
think
going
to
take
at
home
they
look
like
regular
third
avenue
style
to
me
do
worry
i
hardly
touched
them
they
talked
very
directly
like
men
when
they
discussed
clothes
for
to
them
a
clothes
talk
meant
a
business
talk
the
telephone
buzzed
the
three
sprang
up
rustling
that
be
for
us
ella
said
miss
fancy
goods
we
told
the
office
to
call
us
here
the
boys
are
probably
downstairs
she
answered
the
call
turned
nodded
smoothed
her
gloves
and
preened
her
laces
ella
morrissey
in
kimonoed
comfort
waved
a
from
her
armchair
have
a
good
time
you
all
look
lovely
oh
we
met
max
tack
downstairs
looking
like
a
grand
duke
pert
miss
laces
turned
at
the
door
giggling
he
says
the
french
aristocracy
has
nothing
on
him
because
his
grandfather
was
one
of
the
original
ten
ikes
of
new
york
a
final
crescendo
of
laughter
a
last
swishing
of
silks
a
breath
of
perfume
from
the
doorway
and
they
were
gone
within
the
room
the
two
women
sat
looking
at
the
closed
door
for
a
moment
then
ella
morrissey
turned
to
look
at
sophy
gold
just
as
sophy
gold
turned
to
look
at
ella
morrissey
well
smiled
ella
sophy
gold
smiled
too
a
mirthless
smile
i
felt
just
like
this
once
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
went
to
a
party
and
all
the
other
little
girls
had
yellow
curls
maybe
some
of
them
had
brown
ones
but
i
only
remember
a
maze
of
golden
hair
and
pink
and
blue
sashes
and
rosy
cheeks
and
ardent
little
boys
and
the
sureness
of
those
little
girls
their
absolute
faith
in
their
power
to
enthrall
and
in
the
perfection
of
their
curls
and
sashes
i
went
home
before
the
ice
cream
and
i
love
ice
cream
ella
morrissey
eyes
narrowed
thoughtfully
then
the
next
time
you
invited
to
a
party
you
wait
for
the
ice
cream
girlie
maybe
i
will
said
sophy
gold
the
party
came
two
nights
later
it
was
such
a
very
modest
affair
that
one
would
hardly
call
it
that
least
of
all
max
tack
who
had
spent
dollars
the
night
before
in
entertaining
an
important
prospective
buyer
on
her
way
to
her
room
that
sultry
june
night
sophy
had
encountered
the
persistent
tack
ella
morrissey
up
in
her
room
was
fathoms
deep
in
work
it
was
barely
eight
and
there
was
a
wonderful
opal
sky
a
june
twilight
sky
of
which
paris
makes
a
specialty
all
grey
and
rose
and
mauve
and
faint
orange
somebody
looking
mighty
sweet
in
her
new
paris
duds
max
tack
method
of
approach
never
varied
in
its
simplicity
they
not
paris
they
chicago
his
soul
was
in
his
eyes
they
certainly
do
look
it
then
with
a
little
hurt
look
in
those
same
expressive
features
i
suppose
after
the
way
you
threw
me
down
hard
the
other
night
you
would
come
out
and
play
somewhere
would
you
if
i
sat
up
and
begged
and
jumped
through
this
it
too
warm
for
most
things
sophy
faltered
anywhere
your
little
heart
dictates
interrupted
max
tack
ardently
just
name
it
sophy
looked
up
well
then
i
like
to
take
one
of
those
boats
and
go
down
the
river
to
the
station
just
back
of
the
louvre
we
just
time
to
catch
the
boat
boat
echoed
max
tack
stupidly
then
in
revolt
why
say
girlie
you
do
want
to
do
that
what
is
there
in
taking
an
old
tub
and
flopping
down
that
dinky
stream
tell
you
what
we
do
we
no
thanks
said
sophy
and
it
really
does
matter
you
simply
asked
me
what
i
like
to
do
and
i
told
you
thanks
now
now
pleaded
max
tack
in
a
panic
of
course
we
go
i
just
thought
you
rather
do
something
fussier
that
all
i
never
gone
down
the
river
but
i
think
that
a
classy
little
idea
yes
i
do
now
you
run
and
get
your
hat
and
we
jump
into
a
taxi
and
you
do
need
to
jump
into
a
taxi
it
only
two
blocks
we
walk
there
was
a
little
crowd
down
at
the
landing
station
max
tack
noticed
with
immense
relief
that
they
were
not
people
either
he
had
been
rather
afraid
of
workmen
in
red
sashes
and
with
lime
on
their
clothes
especially
after
sophy
had
told
him
that
a
trip
cost
twenty
centimes
each
twenty
centimes
that
about
four
cents
well
my
gad
they
got
seats
in
the
prow
sophy
took
off
her
hat
and
turned
her
face
gratefully
to
the
cool
breeze
as
they
swung
out
into
the
river
the
paris
of
the
rumbling
roaring
auto
buses
and
the
honking
horns
and
the
shrill
cries
and
the
mad
confusion
faded
away
there
was
the
palely
glowing
sky
ahead
and
on
each
side
the
black
reflection
of
the
banks
mistily
mysterious
now
and
very
lovely
there
was
not
a
ripple
on
the
water
and
the
pont
alexandre
iii
and
the
golden
glory
of
the
dome
of
the
h√¥tel
des
invalides
were
ahead
say
this
is
venice
exclaimed
max
tack
a
soft
and
magic
light
covered
the
shore
the
river
the
sky
and
a
soft
and
magic
something
seemed
to
steal
over
the
little
boat
and
work
its
wonders
the
shabby
chap
and
his
equally
shabby
and
merry
little
companion
both
americans
closed
the
bag
of
fruit
from
which
they
had
been
munching
and
sat
looking
into
each
other
eyes
the
artist
who
looked
miraculously
like
pictures
of
robert
louis
stevenson
smiled
down
at
his
queer
little
daughter
in
the
curious
cubist
frock
and
she
smiled
back
and
snuggled
up
and
rested
her
cheek
on
his
arm
there
seemed
to
be
a
deep
and
silent
understanding
between
them
you
knew
somehow
that
the
little
cubist
daughter
had
no
mother
and
that
the
father
artist
friends
made
much
of
her
and
that
she
poured
tea
for
them
prettily
on
special
days
the
bepowdered
french
girl
who
got
on
at
the
second
station
sat
frankly
and
contentedly
in
the
embrace
of
her
sweetheart
the
stolid
married
couple
across
the
way
smiled
and
the
man
arm
rested
on
his
plump
shoulder
so
the
love
boat
glided
down
the
river
into
the
night
and
the
shore
faded
and
became
grey
and
then
black
and
the
lights
came
out
and
cast
slender
pillars
of
gold
and
green
and
scarlet
on
the
water
max
tack
hand
moved
restlessly
sought
sophy
found
it
clasped
it
sophy
hand
had
never
been
clasped
like
that
before
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
so
she
did
nothing
which
was
just
what
she
should
have
done
warm
enough
asked
max
tack
tenderly
just
right
murmured
sophy
the
dream
trip
ended
at
they
learned
to
their
dismay
that
the
boat
did
not
return
to
paris
but
how
to
get
back
they
asked
questions
sought
direction
always
a
frantic
struggle
in
paris
sophy
in
the
glare
of
the
street
light
looked
uglier
than
ever
just
a

said
max
tack
i
find
a
taxi
nonsense
that
man
said
the
street
car
passed
right
here
and
that
we
should
get
off
at
the
bois
here
it
is
now
come
on
max
tack
looked
about
helplessly
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
gave
it
up
you
certainly
make
a
fellow
hump
he
said
not
without
a
note
of
admiration
and
why
are
you
so
afraid
that
i
spend
some
money
as
he
handed
the
conductor
the
tiny
fare
i
do
know
unless
it
because
i
had
to
work
so
hard
all
my
life
for
mine
at
porte
maillot
they
took
one
of
the
flock
of
waiting
but
you
do
want
to
go
home
yet
protested
max
tack
i
i
think
i
should
like
to
drive
in
the
bois
park
if
you
mind
that
is
mind
cried
the
gallant
and
game
max
tack
now
max
tack
was
no
villain
but
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
one
might
drive
in
the
bois
with
a
girl
and
not
make
love
to
her
if
he
had
driven
with
aurora
in
her
chariot
he
would
have
held
her
hand
and
called
her
tender
names
so
because
he
was
he
and
because
this
was
paris
and
because
it
was
so
dark
that
one
could
not
see
sophy
extreme
plainness
he
took
her
unaccustomed
hand
again
in
his
this
little
hand
was
never
meant
for
work
he
murmured
sophy
the
acid
the
tart
said
nothing
the
bois
park
at
night
is
a
mystery
maze
and
lovely
beyond
adjectives
and
the
horse
of
that
particular
wore
a
little
tinkling
bell
that
somehow
added
to
the
charm
of
the
night
a
waterfall
unseen
tumbled
and
frothed
near
by
a
turn
in
the
winding
road
brought
them
to
an
open
stretch
and
they
saw
the
world
bathed
in
the
light
of
a
yellow
mellow
roguish
paris
moon
and
max
tack
leaned
over
quietly
and
kissed
sophy
gold
on
the
lips
now
sophy
gold
had
never
been
kissed
in
just
that
way
before
you
would
have
thought
she
would
not
know
what
to
do
but
the
plainest
woman
as
well
as
the
loveliest
has
the
centuries
back
of
her
sophy
mother
and
her
mother
mother
and
her
mother
mother
mother
had
been
kissed
before
her
so
they
told
her
to
say
you
should
have
done
that
and
the
answer
too
was
backed
by
the
centuries
i
know
it
but
i
could
help
it
do
be
angry
you
know
said
sophy
with
a
little
tremulous
laugh
i
very
very
ugly
when
it
is
moonlight
paris
spake
max
tack
diplomat
is
so
full
of
who
think
they
pretty
and
of
pretty
ones
who
think
they
beauties
that
it
sort
of
rests
my
jaw
and
mind
to
be
with
some
one
who
has
any
fake
notions
to
feed
they
all
right
but
give
me
a
woman
with
brains
every
time
which
was
a
lie
they
drove
home
down
the
bois
the
cool
spacious
bois
and
through
the
champs
√©lys√©es
because
he
was
an
artist
in
his
way
and
because
every
passing
revealed
the
same
picture
max
tack
sat
very
near
her
and
looked
very
tender
and
held
her
hand
in
his
it
would
have
raised
a
laugh
at
broadway
and
it
was
quite
quite
sane
and
very
comforting
in
paris
at
the
door
of
the

wednesday
said

you
you

oh
no
no
you
call
me
up
or
run
into
the
office
when
you
get
to
new
york
oh
yes
he
walked
with
her
to
the
lift
said
and
returned
to
the
with
the
tinkling
bell
there
was
a
stunned
sort
of
look
in
his
face
the
meter
registered
two
francs
seventy
max
tack
did
a
lightning
mental
calculation
the
expression
on
his
face
deepened
he
looked
up
at
the
cabby
the
cabby
with
his
absurd
scarlet
vest
his
trousers
and
his
glazed
top
hat
well
can
you
beat
that
three
francs
thirty
for
the
entertainment
why
why
all
she
wanted
was
just
a
little
love
to
the
one
all
conversation
in
a
foreign
language
meant
dissatisfaction
with
the
meter
he
tapped
that
contrivance
impatiently
with
his
whip
a
flood
of
french
bubbled
at
his
lips
it
all
right
boy
it
all
right
you
do
get
me
and
max
tacked
pressed
a
piece
into
the
outstretched
palm
then
to
the

porter
just
grab
a
taxi
for

you
these

make
me
nervous

to

turned
then
ran
up
the
stairs
to
the
next
floor
and
knocked
gently
at
miss

door
a
moment
later
that
lady
kimonoed
figure
loomed
large
in
the
doorway
who
is
oh
it
you
well
i
was
just
going
to
have

to

rough

done
from

scattered

against

working
this
whole
mortal
evening
went
on
ella

holding
up
a
pencil

and
squinting
at
it
disapprovingly
over
her
working

i
so
tired
that

shut
and
the

running
on

where
you

was
a
shade
limper
than

and
a
strand
of
it
had
become
loosened
and
straggled
untidily
down
over
her
ear
her
eyes
looked
large
and
strangely
luminous

you
know

ella

laid
down
her

and
turned
slowly
she
surveyed
sophy

her
shrewd

twinkling
that
so
what
made
you
change
your

the
dreamy
look
in
sophy
eyes
deepened
why
i
do
know
there
something
in
the
atmosphere
something
in

it
makes
you
do
and
say
foolish
things
it
makes
you
feel
queer
and
light
and
happy
ella
morrissey
bright
twinkle
softened
to
a
glow
she
stared
for
another
brief
moment
then
she
trundled
over
to
where

stood
and
patted
her
leathery
cheek

xi
the
three
of
them
for
eleven
years
martha

head

at
the

had
catered

and
ministered
unknown
to
that
great
careless
shifting
conglomerate
mass
known
as
the
travelling
public
wholesale
hostessing
was
martha

senators

to
the

of

soothed
the
tired

of

for
the

hotel
is
more
than
a
hostelry
it
is
a
chicago
institution
the
whole
world
is
churned
in
at
its
revolving
front
door
for
eleven
years
martha
foote
then
had
beheld
humanity
throwing
its
grimy
suitcases
on
her
immaculate
white
bedspreads
wiping
its
muddy
boots
on
her
bath
towels
scratching
its
matches
on
her

scrawling
its
pencil

on
her
cream
woodwork
spilling
its
greasy
crumbs
on
her
carpet
carrying
away
her

scarfs
and
pincushions
there
is
no
supremer
test
of
character
eleven
years
of
hotel
housekeepership
guarantees
a
knowledge
of
human
nature
that
includes
some
things
no
living
being
ought
to
know
about
her
fellow
men
and
inevitably
one
of
two
results
must
follow
you
degenerate
into
a
bitter
waspish
and
shrew
or
you
develop
into
a
patient
tolerant
and
infinitely
understanding
woman
martha
foote
dealt
daily
with
polack
scrub
girls
and
irish
porters
and
swedish
chambermaids
and
swiss
waiters
and
halsted

italian
tenors
fried

in

college

burned

in
her

yet
any
one
connected
with
the
senate
hotel
from
pete
the
pastry
cook
to
featherstone
could
vouch
for
martha
foote
serene
unacidulation
do
gather
from
this
that
martha
foote
was
a
beaming
motherly
person
who
called
you
dearie
neither
was
she
one
of
those
managerial
and
magnificent
blonde
beings
occasionally
encountered
in
hotel
corridors
engaged
in
addressing
strident
remarks
to
a
damp
and
crawling
huddle
of
calico
that
is
doing
something
sloppy
to
the
woodwork
perhaps
the
shortest
cut
to
martha
foote
character
is
through
martha
bedroom
twelfth
floor
turn
to
your
left
that
it
come
in
in
the
long
years
of
its
growth
and
success
the
senate
hotel
had
known
the
usual
growing
pains
starting
with
walnut
and
red
plush
it
had
in
its
adolescence
broken
out
all
over
into
brass
beds
and
maple
this
in
turn
had
vanished
before
mahogany
veneer
and
brocade
hardly
had
the
white
scratches
on
these
ruddy
surfaces
been
doctored
by
the
house
painter
when
whisk
away
with
that
sombre
stuff
and
in
minced
a
whole
troupe
of
furnishings
cream
enamel
beds
dressing
tables
before
which
it
was
impossible
to
dress
perilous
chairs
with
raspberry
complexions
through
all
these
changes
martha
foote
in
her
big
bright
twelfth
floor
room
had
clung
to
her
old
black
walnut
set
the
bed
to
begin
with
was
a
massive
towering
edifice
with
a
headboard
that
scraped
the
lofty
ceiling
head
and
were
fretted
and
carved
with
great
blobs
representing
grapes
and
cornucopias
and
tendrils
and
knobs
and
other
bedevilments
of
the
craft
it
had
been
polished
and
rubbed
until
now
it
shone
like
soft
brown
satin
there
was
a
monumental
dresser
too
with
a
marble
top
along
the
wall
near
the
windows
was
a
couch
a
heavy
wheezing
couch
decked
out
in
white
ruffled
cushions
i
suppose
the
mere
statement
that
in
chicago
illinois
martha
foote
kept
these
cushions
always
crisply
white
would
make
any
further
characterization
superfluous
the
couch
made
you
think
of
a
plump
grandmother
of
bygone
days
a
beruffled
white
fichu
across
her
ample
comfortable
bosom
then
there
was
the
writing
desk
a
substantial
structure
that
bore
no
relation
to
the
pindling
affairs
that
graced
the
guest
rooms
it
was
the
solid
sort
of
desk
at
which
an
english
novelist
of
the
school
might
have
written
a
whole
row
of
books
without
losing
his
dignity
or
cramping
his
style
martha
foote
used
it
for
making
out
reports
and
instruction
sheets
for
keeping
accounts
and
for
her
small
private
correspondence
such
was
martha
foote
room
in
a
modern
and
successful
hotel
whose
foyer
was
and
tessellated
that
of
hers
was
as
wholesome
and
satisfying
and
real
as
a
piece
of
rye
bread
on
a
tray
of
french
pastry
and
as
incongruous
it
was
to
the
orderly
comfort
of
these
accustomed
surroundings
that
the
housekeeper
of
the
senate
hotel
opened
her
eyes
this
tuesday
morning
opened
them
and
lay
a
moment
bridging
the
morphean
chasm
that
lay
between
last
night
and
this
morning
it
was
it
is
bad
enough
to
open
one
eyes
at
on
monday
morning
but
to
open
them
at
on
tuesday
morning
after
an
indigo
monday
the
taste
of
yesterday
lingered
brackish
in
martha
mouth
oh
well
it
wo
be
as
bad
as
yesterday
anyway
it
ca
so
she
assured
herself
as
she
lay
there
there
never
were
days
like
that
hand
running
not
even
in
the
hotel
business
for
yesterday
had
been
what
is
known
as
a
muddy
monday
thick
murky
and
oozy
with
trouble
two
conventions
three
banquets
the
lobby
so
full
of
khaki
that
it
looked
like
a
a
threatened
strike
in
the
laundry
a
travelling
man
in
who
had
the
grippe
and
thought
he
was
dying
a
shortage
of
towels
that
bugaboo
of
the
hotel
housekeeper
due
to
the
laundry
trouble
that
had
kept
the
telephone
jangling
to
the
tune
of
a
hundred
damp
and
irate
guests
and
weaving
in
and
out
and
above
and
about
and
through
it
all
like
a
neuralgic
toothache
that
ca
be
located
persisted
the
constant
nagging
maddening
complaints
of
the
chronic
kicker
in
was
a
woman
she
had
arrived
monday
morning
early
by
monday
night
every
girl
on
the
switchboard
had
the
nervous
jumps
when
they
plugged
in
at
her
signal
she
had
changed
her
rooms
and
back
again
she
had
quarrelled
with
the
room
clerk
she
had
complained
to
the
office
about
the
service
the
food
the
linen
the
lights
the
noise
the
chambermaid
all
the
and
the
colour
of
the
furnishings
in
her
suite
she
said
she
could
live
with
that
colour
it
made
her
sick
between
and
that
night
there
had
come
a
lull
was
doing
her
turn
at
the
majestic
martha
foote
knew
that
she
knew
too
that
her
name
was
geisha
mccoy
and
she
knew
what
that
name
meant
just
as
you
do
she
had
even
laughed
and
quickened
and
responded
to
geisha
mccoy
manipulation
of
her
audience
just
as
you
have
martha
foote
knew
the
value
of
the
personal
note
and
it
had
been
her
idea
that
had
resulted
in
the
rule
which
obliged
elevator
boys
chambermaids
floor
clerks
doormen
and
waiters
if
possible
to
learn
the
names
of
senate
hotel
guests
no
matter
how
brief
their
stay
they
like
it
she
had
said
to
manager
brant
you
know
that
better
than
i
do
they
be
flattered
and
surprised
and
tickled
to
death
and
they
go
back
to
burlington
iowa
and
tell
how
well
known
they
are
at
the
senate
when
the
suggestion
was
met
with
the
argument
that
no
human
being
could
be
expected
to
perform
such
daily
feats
of
memory
martha
foote
battered
it
down
with
that
just
where
you
mistaken
the
first
few
days
are
bad
after
that
it
easier
every
day
until
it
becomes
mechanical
i
remember
when
i
first
started
waiting
on
table
in
my
mother
quick
lunch
eating
house
in
sorghum
minnesota
i
bring
wheat
cakes
when
they
ordered
pork
and
beans
but
it
was
two
weeks
before
i
could
take
six
orders
from
soup
to
pie
without
so
much
as
forgetting
the
catsup
habit
that
all
so
she
as
well
as
the
minor
hotel
employ√©s
knew
as
geisha
mccoy
geisha
mccoy
who
got
a
thousand
a
week
for
singing
a
few
songs
and
chatting
informally
with
the
delighted
hundreds
on
the
other
side
of
the
footlights
geisha
mccoy
made
nothing
of
those
same
footlights
she
reached
out
so
to
speak
and
shook
hands
with
you
across
their
amber
glare
neither
lovely
nor
alluring
this
woman
and
as
for
her
voice
and
yet
for
ten
years
or
more
this
rather
plain
person
somewhat
dumpy
no
longer
young
had
been
singing
her
human
songs
about
human
people
and
invariably
and
figuratively
her
audience
clambered
up
over
the
footlights
and
sat
in
her
lap
she
had
never
resorted
to
cheap
tricks
she
had
never
invited
the
gallery
to
join
in
the
chorus
she
descended
to
no
but
when
she
sang
a
song
about
a
waitress
she
was
a
waitress
she
never
hesitated
to
twist
up
her
hair
and
pull
down
her
mouth
to
get
an
effect
she
did
seem
to
be
thinking
about
herself
at
all
or
about
her
clothes
or
her
method
or
her
effort
or
anything
but
the
audience
that
was
plastic
to
her
deft
and
magic
manipulation
until
very
recently
six
months
had
wrought
a
subtle
change
in
geisha
mccoy
she
still
sang
her
human
songs
about
human
people
but
you
failed
somehow
to
recognise
them
as
such
they
sounded
and
you
were
likely
to
hear
the
man
behind
you
say
yeh
but
you
ought
to
have
heard
her
five
years
ago
she
about
through
such
was
martha
foote
luxuriating
in
that
one
delicious
moment
between
her
awakening
and
her
arising
mused
on
these
things
she
thought
of
how
at
eleven
the
night
before
her
telephone
had
rung
with
the
sharp
zing
of
trouble
the
voice
of
irish
nellie
on
night
duty
on
the
sixth
floor
had
sounded
sure
sign
of
distress
with
her
i
sorry

cheerful
close
martha
foote
sat
up
in

now
preparatory
to
the
heroic
flinging
aside
of
the
covers
no
she
assured
herself
it
ca
be
as
bad
as
yesterday
she
reached
round
and
about
her
pillow
groping
for
the
recalcitrant
hairpin
that
always
slipped
out
during
the
night
found
it
and
twisted
her
hair
into
a
hard
bathtub
bun
with
a
jangle
that
tore
through
her
senses
the
telephone
at
her
bedside
shrilled
into
life
martha
foote
hairpin
in
mouth
turned
and
eyed
it
speculatively
fearfully
it
shrilled
on
in
her
very
face
and
there
seemed
something
taunting
and
vindictive
about
it
one
long
ring
followed
by
a
short
one
a
long
ring
a
short
it
it
something
tells
me
i
wrong
martha
foote
told
herself
ruefully
and
reached
for
the
blatant
snarling
thing
yes
foote
this
is
healy
the
night
clerk
say
foote
i
think
you
better
step
down
to
and
see
what

martha
foote
what
that
nothing
go
on
will
i
step
down
to
and
she
sick
or
something
hysterics
i
say
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
it
was
something
about
a
noise
or
a
sound
or
anyway
she
locate
it
and
her
maid
says
if
we
do
stop
it
right
away
i
go
down
maybe
it
the
plumbing
or
the
radiator
did
you
ask
no
nothing
like
that
she
kept
talking
about
a
wail
a
what
a
wail
a
kind
of
groaning
you
know
and
then
dull
raps
on
the
wall
behind
the
bed
now
look
here
ed
healy
i
get
up
at
but
i
ca
see
a
joke
before
ten
if
you
trying
to
be
funny
funny
why
say
listen
foote
i
may
be
a
night
clerk
but
not
so
low
as
to
get
you
out
at
half
past
six
to
spring
a
thing
like
that
in
fun
i
mean
it
so
did
she
but
a
kind
of
moaning
and
then
dull
raps
those
are
her
words
a
kind
of
m
let
not
make
a
chant
of
it
i
think
i
get
you
i
be
down
there
in
ten
minutes
telephone
her
will
you
ca
you
make
it
five
not
without
skipping
something
vital
still
it
could
have
been
a
second
over
ten
including
shoes
hair
and
and
a
fresh
white
blouse
it
was
martha
theory
that
a
hotel
housekeeper
dressed
for
work
ought
to
be
as
inconspicuous
as
a
steel
engraving
she
would
have
been
too
if
it
had
been
for
her
eyes
she
paused
a
moment
before
the
door
of
and
took
a
deep
breath
at
the
first
brisk
of
her
knuckles
on
the
door
there
had
sounded
a
shrill
come
in
but
before
she
could
turn
the
knob
the
door
was
flung
open
by
a
kimonoed
mulatto
girl
her
eyes
all
whites
the
girl
began
to
jabber
incoherently
but
martha
foote
passed
on
through
the
little
hall
to
the
door
of
the
bedroom
was
in
bed
at
sight
of
her
martha
foote
knew
that
she
had
to
deal
with
an
woman
her
hair
was
pushed
back
wildly
from
her
forehead
her
arms
were
clasped
about
her
knees
at
the
left
her
nightgown
had
slipped
down
so
that
one
plump
white
shoulder
gleamed
against
the
background
of
her
streaming
hair
the
room
was
in
almost
comic
disorder
it
was
a
room
in
which
a
struggle
has
taken
place
between
its
occupant
and
that
hag
sleeplessness
the
hag
it
was
plain
had
won
a
glass
of
milk
was
on
the
table
by
the
bed
warmed
and
sipped
slowly
it
had
evidently
failed
to
soothe
a
tray
of
dishes
littered
another
table
yesterday
dishes
their
contents
congealed
books
and
magazines
their
covers
spread
wide
as
if
they
had
been
flung
sprawled
where
they
lay
a
little
heap
of
cigarette
stubs
the
window
curtain
awry
where
she
had
stood
there
during
a
feverish
moment
of
the
sleepless
night
looking
down
upon
the
lights
of
grant
park
and
the
sombre
black
void
beyond
that
was
lake
michigan
a
tiny
satin
bedroom
slipper
on
a
chair
its
mate
sole
up
peeping
out
from
under
the
bed
a
pair
of
satin
slippers
alone
distributed
thus
would
make
a
nun
cell
look
disreputable
over
all
this
disorder
the
ceiling
lights
the
wall
lights
and
the
light
from
two
rosy
lamps
beat
mercilessly
down
and
upon
the
woman
in
the
bed
she
stared
at
martha
foote
martha
foote
in
the
doorway
gazed
serenely
back
upon
her
and
geisha
mccoy
quick
intelligence
and
responded
to
the
picture
of
this
calm
and
capable
figure
in
the
midst
of
the
feverish
room
in
that
moment
the
nervous
pucker
between
her
eyes
ironed
out
ever
so
little
and
something
resembling
a
wan
smile
crept
into
her
face
and
what
she
said
was
i
would
have
believed
it
believed
what
inquired
martha
foote
pleasantly
that
there
was
anybody
left
in
the
world
who
could
look
like
that
in
a
white
shirtwaist
at
is
that
all
your
own
hair
strictly
some
people
have
all
the
luck
sighed
geisha
mccoy
and
dropped
listlessly
back
on
her
pillows
martha
foote
came
forward
into
the
room
at
that
instant
the
woman
in
the
bed
sat
up
again
tense
every
nerve
strained
in
an
attitude
of
listening
the
mulatto
girl
had
come
swiftly
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
was
clutching
the
footboard
her
knuckles
showing
white
listen
a
hissing
whisper
from
the
haggard
woman
in
the
bed
that
wha
dat
breathed
the
coloured
girl
all
her
elegance
gone
her
every
look
and
motion
a
throwback
to
her
ancestors
the
three
women
remained
rigid
listening
from
the
wall
somewhere
behind
the
bed
came
a
low
weird
monotonous
sound
half
wail
half
croaking
moan
like
a
banshee
with
a
cold
a
clanking
then
as
of
chains
a
then
three
dull
raps
seemingly
from
within
the
very
wall
itself
the
coloured
girl
was
trembling
her
lips
were
moving
soundlessly
but
geisha
mccoy
emotion
was
made
of
different
stuff
now
look
here
she
said
desperately
i
do
mind
a
sleepless
night
i
used
to
but
usually
i
can
drop
off
at
five
for
a
little
while
and
that
been
going
on
well
i
do
know
how
long
it
driving
me
crazy
blanche
you
fool
stop
that
hand
wringing
i
tell
you
there
no
such
thing
as
ghosts
now
you
she
turned
to
martha
foote
again
you
tell
me
for
god
sake
what
that
and
into
martha
foote
face
there
came
such
a
look
of
mingled
compassion
and
mirth
as
to
bring
a
quick
flame
of
fury
into
geisha
mccoy
eyes
look
here
you
may
think
it
funny
but
i
do
i
do
wait
a
minute
martha
foote
turned
and
was
gone
an
instant
later
the
weird
sounds
ceased
the
two
women
in
the
room
looked
toward
the
door
expectantly
and
through
it
came
martha
foote
smiling
she
turned
and
beckoned
to
some
one
without
come
on
she
said
come
on
she
put
out
a
hand
encouragingly
and
brought
forward
the
shrinking
cowering
timorous
figure
of
anna
czarnik
on
the
sixth
floor
her
hand
still
on
her
shoulder
martha
foote
led
her
to
the
centre
of
the
room
where
she
stood
gazing
dumbly
about
she
was
the
you
seen
in
every
hotel
from
san
francisco
to
scituate
a
shapeless
moist
blue
calico
mass
her
shoes
turned
up
ludicrously
at
the
toes
as
do
the
shoes
of
one
who
crawls
her
way
backward
on
hands
and
knees
her
hands
were
the
shrivelled
unlovely
members
that
bespeak
long
and
daily
immersion
in
dirty
water
but
even
had
these
invariable
marks
of
her
trade
been
lacking
you
could
not
have
failed
to
recognise
her
type
by
the
large
and
glittering
comb
which
failed
to
catch
up
her
dank
and
stringy
hair
in
the
back
one
kindly
hand
on
the
woman
arm
martha
foote
performed
the
introduction
this
is
anna
czarnik
late
of
poland
widowed
likewise
childless
also
brotherless
also
many
other
uncomfortable
things
but
the
life
of
the
crowd
in
the
quarters
on
the
top
floor
are
you
anna
anna
czarnik
i
sorry
to
say
is
the
source
of
the
moan
and
the
swishing
and
the
clanking
and
the
there
is
a
service
stairway
just
on
the
other
side
of
this
wall
anna
czarnik
was
performing
her
morning
job
of
scrubbing
it
the
swishing
was
her
wet
rag
the
clanking
was
her
pail
the
dull
raps
her
scrubbing
brush
striking
the
stair
corner
just
behind
your
wall
you
forgetting
the
wail
geisha
mccoy
suggested
icily
no
i
not
the
wail
i
afraid
was
anna
czarnik
singing
singing
martha
foote
turned
and
spoke
a
gibberish
of
polish
and
english
to
the
bewildered
woman
at
her
side
anna
czarnik
dull
face
lighted
up
ever
so
little
she
says
the
thing
she
was
singing
is
a
polish
about
death
and
sorrow
and
it
called
a
what
was
that
anna
dumka
it
called
a
dumka
it
a
song
of
mourning
you
see
of
grief
and
of
bitterness
against
the
invaders
who
have
laid
her
country
bare
well
what
the
idea
demanded
geisha
mccoy
what
kind
of
a
hotel
is
this
anyway
waking
people
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
a
polish
cabaret
if
she
wants
to
sing
her
hymn
of
hate
why
does
she
have
to
pick
on
me
i
sorry
you
can
go
anna
no
sing
remember
anna
czarnik
nodded
and
made
her
unwieldy
escape
geisha
mccoy
waved
a
hand
at
the
mulatto
maid
go
to
your
room
blanche
i
ring
when
i
need
you
the
girl
vanished
gratefully
without
a
backward
glance
at
the
disorderly
room
martha
foote
felt
herself
dismissed
too
and
yet
she
made
no
move
to
go
she
stood
there
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
every
housekeeper
inch
of
her
yearned
to
tidy
the
chaos
all
about
her
and
every
sympathetic
impulse
urged
her
to
comfort
the
woman
before
her
something
of
this
must
have
shone
in
her
face
for
geisha
mccoy
tone
was
as
she
spoke
you
no
business
allowing
things
like
that
you
know
my
nerves
are
all
shot
to
pieces
anyway
but
even
if
they
were
who
could
stand
that
kind
of
torture
a
woman
like
that
ought
to
lose
her
job
for
that
one
word
from
me
at
the
office
and
she
do
say
it
then
interrupted
martha
foote
and
came
over
to
the
bed
mechanically
her
fingers
straightened
the
tumbled
covers
removed
a
jumble
of
magazines
flicked
away
the
crumbs
i
sorry
you
were
disturbed
the
scrubbing
ca
be
helped
of
course
but
there
is
a
rule
against
unnecessary
noise
and
she
should
have
been
singing
but
well
i
suppose
she
got
to
find
relief
somehow
would
you
believe
that
woman
is
the
of
the
top
floor
she
a
natural
comedian
and
she
does
more
for
me
in
the
way
of
keeping
the
other
girls
happy
and
satisfied
than
what
about
me
where
do
i
come
in
instead
of
sleeping
until
eleven
i
kept
awake
by
this
polish
dirge
i
go
on
at
the
majestic
at
four
and
again
at
and
i
sick
i
tell
you
sick
she
looked
it
too
suddenly
she
twisted
about
and
flung
herself
face
downward
on
the
pillow
oh
god
she
cried
without
any
particular
expression
oh
god
oh
god
that
decided
martha
foote
she
crossed
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
bed
first
flicking
off
the
glaring
top
lights
sat
down
beside
the
shaken
woman
on
the
pillows
and
laid
a
cool
light
hand
on
her
shoulder
it
is
as
bad
as
that
or
it
wo
be
anyway
after
you
told
me
about
it
she
waited
geisha
mccoy
remained
as
she
was
face
down
but
she
did
not
openly
resent
the
hand
on
her
shoulder
so
martha
foote
waited
and
as
suddenly
as
had
flung
herself
prone
she
twisted
about
and
sat
up
breathing
quickly
she
passed
a
hand
over
her
eyes
and
pushed
back
her
streaming
hair
with
an
oddly
desperate
little
gesture
her
lips
were
parted
her
eyes
wide
they
got
away
from
me
she
cried
and
martha
foote
knew
what
she
meant
i
ca
hold
any
more
i
work
as
hard
as
ever
harder
that
it
it
seems
the
harder
i
work
the
colder
they
get
last
week
in
indianapolis
they
could
have
been
more
indifferent
if
i
been
the
educational
film
that
closes
the
show
and
oh
my
god
they
sit
and
knit
knit
echoed
martha
foote
but
everybody
knitting
nowadays
not
when
i
on
they
ca
but
they
do
there
were
three
of
them
in
the
third
row
yesterday
afternoon
one
of
was
doing
a
grey
sock
with
four
shiny
needles
four
i
could
keep
my
eyes
off
of
them
and
the
second
was
doing
a
sweater
and
the
third
a
helmet
i
could
tell
by
the
shape
and
you
ca
be
funny
can
you
when
you
hypnotised
by
three
females
all
doubled
up
over
a
bunch
of
i
scared
of
it
it
sticks
out
all
over
the
house
last
night
there
were
two
young
kids
in
uniform
right
down
in
the
first
row
centre
right
i
bet
the
oldest
was
there
they
sat
looking
up
at
me
with
their
baby
faces
that
all
they
are
kids
the
house
seems
to
be
peppered
with
you
would
think
could
stick
out
the
way
it
does
i
can
see
it
farther
than
red
i
can
see
it
day
and
night
i
ca
seem
to
see
anything
else
i
ca
her
head
came
down
on
her
arms
that
rested
on
her
knees
somebody
of
yours
in
it
martha
foote
asked
quietly
she
waited
then
she
made
a
wild
guess

intuitive
guess

with
everything
in
me
just
set
like
an
for
the
time
when
that
kid
would
step
off
on
his
own
he
always
hated
to
take
money
from
me
and
i
loved
him
for
it
i
never
went
on
that
i
did
think
of
him
i
never
came
off
with
a
half
dozen
encores
that
i
did
wish
he
could
hear
it
why
when
i
played
a
college
town
it
used
to
be
a
riot
because
i
loved
every
boy
in
the
house
and
they
knew
it
and
now
and
now
what
there
in
it
what
there
in
it
i
ca
even
hold
any
more
i
through
i
tell
you
i
through
and
waited
to
be
disputed
martha
foote
did
not
disappoint
her
there
just
this
in
it
it
up
to
you
to
make
those
three
women
in
the
third
row
forget
what
they
knitting
for
even
if
they
forget
their
knitting
let
go
on
knitting
with
their
hands
but
keep
their
heads
off
it
that
your
job
you
lucky
to
have
it
lucky
yes
you
can
do
all
the
dumka
stuff
in
private
the
way
anna
czarnik
does
but
it
up
to
you
to
make
them
laugh
twice
a
day
for
twenty
minutes
it
all
very
well
for
you
to
talk
that
stuff
it
has
come
home
to
you
i
can
see
that
martha
foote
smiled
if
you
do
mind
my
saying
it
miss
mccoy
too
worn
out
from
lack
of
sleep
to
see
anything
clearly
you
do
know
me
but
i
do
know
you
you
see
i
know
that
a
year
ago
anna
czarnik
would
have
been
the
most
interesting
thing
in
this
town
for
you
have
copied
her
clothes
and
got
a
translation
of
her
sob
song
and
made
her
as
real
to
a
thousand
audiences
as
she
was
to
us
this
morning
tragic
history
patient
animal
face
comic
shoes
and
all
and
that
the
trouble
with
you
my
dear
when
we
begin
to
brood
about
our
own
troubles
we
lose
what
they
call
the
human
touch
and
that
your
business
asset
geisha
mccoy
was
looking
up
at
her
with
a
whimsical
look
here
you
know
too
much
you
not
really
the
hotel
housekeeper
are
you
i
am
well
then
you
were
always
yes
i
was
so
far
as
i
know
i
the
only
hotel
housekeeper
in
history
who
ca
look
back
to
the
time
when
she
had
three
servants
of
her
own
and
her
private
carriage
i
no
decayed
gentlewoman
not
me
my
father
drove
a
hack
in
sorgham
minnesota
and
my
mother
took
in
boarders
and
i
helped
wait
on
table
i
married
when
i
was
twenty
my
man
died
two
years
later
and
i
been
earning
my
living
ever
since
happy
i
must
be
because
i
do
stop
to
think
about
it
it
part
of
my
job
to
know
everything
that
concerns
the
comfort
of
the
guests
in
this
hotel
including
hysterics
in
including
and
that
reminds
me
up
on
the
twelfth
floor
of
this
hotel
there
a
big
bedroom
in
half
an
hour
i
can
have
that
room
made
up
with
the
softest
linen
sheets
and
the
curtains
pulled
down
and
not
a
sound
that
room
so
restful
it
would
put
old
insomnia
himself
to
sleep
will
you
let
me
tuck
you
away
in
it
geisha
mccoy
slid
down
among
her
rumpled
covers
and
nestled
her
head
in
the
lumpy
tortured
pillows
me
i
going
to
stay
right
here
but
this
room
why
it
as
stale
as
a
pullman
sleeper
let
me
have
the
chambermaid
in
to
freshen
it
up
while
you
gone
i
used
to
it
i
got
to
have
a
room
mussed
up
to
feel
at
home
in
it
thanks
just
the
same
martha
foote
rose
i
sorry
i
just
thought
if
i
could
help
geisha
mccoy
leaned
forward
with
one
of
her
quick
movements
and
caught
martha
foote
hand
in
both
her
own
you
have
and
i
do
mean
to
be
rude
when
i
tell
you
i
have
felt
so
much
like
sleeping
in
weeks
just
turn
out
those
lights
will
you
and
sort
of
tiptoe
out
to
give
the
effect
then
as
martha
foote
reached
the
door
and
oh

think
she
sell
me
those
shoes
martha
foote
did
get
her
dinner
that
night
until
almost
eight

thing

so
bad

on
that
the
senate
hotel

a
gleaming

of
white

irish

a

leave
tyler
kamps
was
a
tired
boy
he
was
tired
from
his
left
great
toe
to
that
topmost
spot
at
the
crown
of
his
head
where
six
unruly
hairs
always
persisted
in
sticking
straight
out
in
defiance
of
patient
brushing
wetting
and
greasing
tyler
kamps
was
as
tired
as
only
a
boy
can
be
at
who
has
risen
at
yet
he
lay
wide
awake
in
his
hammock
eight
feet
above
the
ground
like
a
giant
in
an
incredible
cocoon
and
listened
to
the
that
came
from
the
depths
of
two
hundred
similar
cocoons
suspended
at
regular
intervals
down
the
long
dark
room
a
chorus
of
deep
regular
breathing
with
an
occasional
grunt
or
sigh
denoting
complete
relaxation
tyler
kamps
should
have
been
part
of
this
chorus
himself
instead
he
lay
staring
into
the
darkness
thinking
mad
thoughts
of
which
this
is
a
sample
gosh
would
i
like
to
sit
up
in
my
hammock
and
give
one
yell
the
kind
of
a
yell
a
movie
cowboy
gives
on
a
saturday
night
wake
up
and
stop
that
darned
old
breathing
nerves
he
breathed
deeply
himself
once
or
twice
because
it
seemed
somehow
to
relieve
his
feeling
of
irritation
and
in
that
unguarded
moment
of
unconscious
relaxation
sleep
that
had
been
lying
in
wait
for
him
just
around
the
corner
pounced
on
him
and
claimed
him
for
its
own
from
his
hammock
came
the
deep
regular
inhalation
exhalation
with
an
occasional
grunt
or
sigh
the
normal
of
a
very
tired
boy
the
trouble
with
tyler
kamps
was
that
he
missed
two
things
he
expected
to
miss
at
all
and
he
missed
not
at
all
the
things
he
had
been
prepared
to
miss
most
hideously
first
of
all
he
had
expected
to
miss
his
mother
if
you
had
known
stella
kamps
you
could
readily
have
understood
that
stella
kamps
was
the
kind
of
mother
they
sing
about
in
the
sentimental
ballads
mother
pal
and
sweetheart
which
was
where
she
had
made
her
big
mistake
when
one
mother
tries
to
be
all
those
things
to
one
son
that
son
has
a
very
fair
chance
of
turning
out
a
mollycoddle
the
war
was
probably
all
that
saved
tyler
kamps
from
such
a
fate
in
the
way
she
handled
this
son
of
hers
stella
kamps
had
been
as
crafty
and
skilful
and
as
a
girl
with
her
beau
the
proof
of
it
is
that
tyler
had
never
known
he
was
being
handled
some
folks
in
marvin
texas
said
she
actually
flirted
with
him
and
they
were
almost
justified
certainly
the
way
she
glanced
up
at
him
from
beneath
her
lashes
was
excused
only
by
the
way
she
scolded
him
if
he
tracked
up
the
kitchen
floor
but
then
stella
kamps
and
her
boy
were
different
anyway
marvin
folks
all
agreed
about
that
flowers
on
the
table
at
meals
sitting
over
the
supper
things
talking
and
laughing
for
an
hour
after
they
finished
eating
as
if
they
had
seen
each
other
in
years
reading
out
loud
to
each
other
out
of
books
and
then
going
on
like
mad
about
what
they
just
read
and
getting
all
het
up
about
it
and
sometimes
chasing
each
other
around
the
yard
spring
evenings
like
a
couple
of
fool
kids
honestly
if
a
body
did
know
stella
kamps
so
well
and
what
a
fight
she
had
put
up
to
earn
a
living
for
herself
and
the
boy
after
that
kamps
up
and
left
her
and
what
a
housekeeper
she
was
and
all
a
person
think
well
so
then
tyler
had
expected
to
miss
her
first
of
all
the
way
she
talked
the
way
she
fussed
around
him
without
in
the
least
seeming
to
fuss
her
special
way
of
cooking
things
her
laugh
which
drew
laughter
in
its
wake
the
funny
way
she
had
of
saying
things
vitalising
commonplaces
with
the
spark
of
her
own
electricity
and
now
he
missed
her
only
as
the
average
boy
of
misses
the
mother
he
has
been
used
to
all
his
life
no
more
and
no
less
which
would
indicate
that
stella
kamps
in
her
protean
endeavours
had
overplayed
the
parts
just
a
trifle
he
had
expected
to
miss
the
boys
at
the
bank
he
had
expected
to
miss
the
mandolin
club
the
mandolin
club
met
officially
every
thursday
and
spangled
the
texas
night
with
their
tinkling
five
rather
adolescents
slumped
in
comfort
over
the
instruments
cradled
in
their
arms
each
right
leg
crossed
limply
over
the
left
each
great
foot
that
dangled
from
the
bony
ankle
keeping
rhythmic
time
to
the
he
had
expected
to
miss
the
familiar
faces
on
main
street
he
had
even
expected
to
miss
the
neighbours
with
whom
he
and
his
mother
had
so
rarely
mingled
all
the
hundred
little
intimate
trivial
everyday
things
that
had
gone
to
make
up
his
life
back
home
in
marvin
texas
these
he
had
expected
to
miss
and
he
did
after
ten
weeks
at
the
great
central
naval
training
station
so
near
chicago
illinois
and
so
far
from
marvin
texas
there
were
two
things
he
missed
he
wanted
the
decent
privacy
of
his
small
quiet
bedroom
back
home
he
wanted
to
talk
to
a
girl
he
knew
he
wanted
the
first
definitely
he
did
know
he
wanted
the
second
the
fact
that
he
did
know
it
was
stella
kamps
fault
she
had
kept
his
boyhood
girlless
year
and
year
by
sheer
force
of
her
own
love
for
him
and
need
of
him
and
by
the
charm
and
magnetism
that
were
hers
she
had
been
deprived
of
a
more
legitimate
outlet
for
these
emotions
concentrated
on
the
boy
they
had
sufficed
for
him
the
marvin
girls
had
long
ago
given
him
up
as
hopeless
they
fell
back
baffled
their
keenest
weapons
dulled
by
the
impenetrable
armour
of
his
impersonal
gaze
the
room
it
had
been
much
of
a
room
as
rooms
go
bare
clean
asceptic
with
a
narrow
hard
white
bed
and
a
maple
dresser
whose
second
drawer
always
stuck
and
came
out
when
you
pulled
it
and
a
swimmy
mirror
that
made
one
side
of
your
face
look
sort
of
lumpy
and
higher
than
the
other
side
in
one
corner
a
bookshelf
he
had
made
it
himself
at
manual
training
when
he
had
finished
it
the
planing
the
staining
the
polishing
chippendale
himself
after
he
had
designed
and
executed
his
first
gracious
chair
could
have
felt
no
finer
creative
glow
as
for
the
books
it
held
just
to
run
your
eye
over
them
was
like
watching
tyler
kamps
grow
up
stella
kamps
had
been
a
kansas
school
teacher
in
the
days
before
she
met
and
married
clint
kamps
and
she
had
never
quite
got
over
it
so
the
book
case
contained
certain
things
that
a
fond
mother
with
a
teaching
past
would
think
her
small
son
ought
to
enjoy
things
like
tom
brown
at
rugby
and
hans
brinker
or
the
silver
skates
he
had
read
them
dutifully
but
they
were
as
good
as
new
no
thumbed
pages
no
ragged
edges
no
creases
and
tatters
where
eager
boy
hands
had
turned
a
page
over
hastily
no
the
grimy
ones
were
as
always
tom
sawyer
and
huckleberry
finn
and
marching
against
the
iroquois
a
hot
enough
little
room
in
the
texas
summers
a
cold
enough
little
room
in
the
texas
winters
but
his
own
and
quiet
he
used
to
lie
there
at
night
relaxed
just
before
sleep
claimed
him
and
he
could
almost
feel
the
soft
texas
night
enfold
him
like
a
great
velvety
invisible
blanket
soothing
him
lulling
him
in
the
morning
it
had
been
pleasant
to
wake
up
to
its
bare
clean
whiteness
and
to
the
tantalising
breakfast
smells
coming
up
from
the
kitchen
below
his
mother
calling
from
the
foot
of
the
narrow
wooden
stairway
rising
inflection
falling
inflection
get
up
son
breakfast
be
ready
it
was
always
a
terrific
struggle
between
a
last
delicious
stolen
five
minutes
between
the
covers
and
the
scent
of
the
coffee
and
bacon
you
be
late
a
mighty
stretch
a
gathering
of
his
will
forces
a
swing
of
his
long
legs
over
the
side
of
the
bed
so
that
they
described
an
arc
in
the
air
been
up
years
breakfast
had
won
until
he
came
to
the
great
central
naval
training
station
nearest
approach
to
the
nautical
life
had
been
when
at
the
age
of
six
he
had
sailed
chips
in
the
wash
tub
in
the
back
yard
marvin
texas
is
five
hundred
miles
inland
and
yet
he
had
enlisted
in
the
navy
as
inevitably
as
though
he
had
sprung
from
a
long
line
of
vikings
in
his
boyhood
his
choice
of
games
had
always
been
pirate
you
saw
him
a
red
handkerchief
binding
his
brow
one
foot
advanced
knee
bent
scanning
the
horizon
for
the
treasure
island
from
the
vantage
point
of
the
woodshed
roof
while
the
crew
gone
mad
with
thirst
snarled
and
shrieked
all
about
him
and
the
dirt
yard
below
became
a
hungry
roaring
sea
his
vocabulary
boasted
such
compound
difficulties
as
and
he
knew
the
intricate
parts
of
a
ship
from
the
mainsail
to
the
deck
from
the
to
the
all
this
from
pictures
and
books
it
was
the
roving
restless
spirit
of
his
father
in
him
i
suppose
clint
kamps
had
never
been
meant
for
marriage
when
the
baby
tyler
was
one
year
old
clint
had
walked
over
to
where
his
wife
sat
the
child
in
her
lap
and
had
tilted
her
head
back
kissed
her
on
the
lips
and
had
gently
pinched
the
boy
roseleaf
cheek
with
a
quizzical
forefinger
and
thumb
then
indolently
negligently
gracefully
he
had
strolled
out
of
the
house
down
the
steps
into
the
hot
and
dusty
street
and
so
on
and
on
and
out
of
their
lives
stella
kamps
had
never
seen
him
again
her
letters
back
home
to
her
folks
in
kansas
were
triumphs
of
bravery
and
lying
the
kind
of
bravery
and
the
kind
of
lying
that
only
a
woman
could
understand
she
managed
to
make
out
somehow
at
first
and
later
very
well
indeed
as
the
years
went
on
she
and
the
boy
lived
together
in
a
sort
of
closed
corporation
paradise
of
their
own
at
tyler
who
had
gone
through
grammar
school
high
school
and
business
college
had
never
kissed
a
girl
or
felt
a
stella
kamps
kept
her
age
as
a
woman
does
whose
brain
and
body
are
alert
and
busy
when
tyler
first
went
to
work
in
the
texas
state
savings
bank
of
marvin
the
girls
would
come
in
on
various
pretexts
just
for
a
glimpse
of
his
charming
blondeur
behind
the
little
cage
at
the
rear
it
is
difficult
for
a
girl
to
think
of
reasons
for
going
into
a
bank
you
have
to
be
moneyed
to
do
it
they
say
that
the
davies
girl
saved
up
nickels
until
she
had
a
dollar
worth
and
then
came
into
the
bank
and
asked
to
have
a
bill
in
exchange
for
it
they
gave
her
one
a
crisp
new
crackly
dollar
bill
she
reached
for
it
gropingly
her
eyes
fixed
on
a
point
at
the
rear
of
the
bank
two
days
later
she
came
in
and
brazenly
asked
to
have
it
changed
into
nickels
again
she
might
have
gone
on
indefinitely
thus
if
tyler
country
had
given
him
something
more
important
to
do
than
to
change
dollars
into
nickels
and
back
again
on
the
day
he
left
for
the
faraway
naval
training
station
stella
kamps
for
the
second
time
in
her
life
had
a
chance
to
show
the
stuff
she
was
made
of
and
showed
it
not
a
whimper
down
at
the
train
standing
at
the
car
window
looking
up
at
him
and
smiling
and
saying
futile
foolish
final
things
and
seeing
only
his
blond
head
among
the
many
thrust
out
of
the
open
window
and
tyler
remember
what
i
said
about
your
feet
you
know
dry
and
i
send
a
box
every
week
only
do
eat
too
many
of
the
nut
cookies
they
so
rich
give
some
to
the
other
yes
i
know
you
will
i
was
just
wo
it
be
grand
to
be
right
there
on
the
water
all
the
time
my
i
write
every
night
and
then
send
it
twice
a
week
i
do
suppose
you
well
once
a
week
wo
you
dear
you
you
moving
the
train
going
she
ran
along
with
it
for
a
few
feet
awkwardly
as
a
woman
runs
stumblingly
and
suddenly
as
she
ran
his
head
always
just
ahead
of
her
she
thought
with
a
great
pang
o
my
god
how
young
he
is
how
young
he
is
and
he
does
know
anything
i
should
have
told
him
things
he
does
know
anything
about
and
all
those
other
men
she
ran
on
one
arm
outstretched
as
though
to
hold
him
a
moment
longer
while
the
train
gathered
speed
tyler
she
called
through
the
din
and
shouting
tyler
be
good
be
good
he
only
saw
her
lips
moving
and
could
not
hear
so
he
nodded
his
head
and
smiled
and
waved
and
was
gone
so
tyler
kamps
had
travelled
up
to
chicago
whenever
they
passed
a
sizable
town
they
had
thrown
open
the
windows
and
yelled
youp
yow
people
had
rushed
to
the
streets
and
had
stood
there
gazing
after
the
train
tyler
had
done
much
youping
at
first
but
in
the
later
stages
of
the
journey
he
joined
in
to
keep
his
spirits
up
he
who
had
never
been
more
than
a
ride
from
home
was
flashing
past
villages
towns
cities
hundreds
of
them
the
first
few
days
had
been
unbelievably
bad
what
with
typhoid
inoculations
smallpox
vaccinations
and
loneliness
the
very
first
day
when
he
had
entered
his
barracks
one
of
the
other
boys
older
in
experience
misled
by
tyler
pink
and
white
and
gold
colouring
had
leaned
forward
from
amongst
a
group
and
had
called
in
glad
surprise
at
the
top
of
a
leathery
pair
of
lungs
why
hello
sweetheart
the
others
had
taken
it
up
with
cruelty
of
their
age
hello
sweetheart
it
had
stuck
sweetheart
in
the
hard
years
that
followed
years
in
which
the
and
piratical
games
of
his
boyhood
paled
to
the
mildest
of
imaginings
the
nickname
still
clung
long
after
he
had
ceased
to
resent
it
long
after
he
had
stripes
and
braid
to
refute
it
but
in
that
tyler
kamps
we
are
not
interested
it
is
the
boy
tyler
kamps
with
whom
we
have
to
do
bewildered
lonely
and
a
little
resentful
wondering
where
the
sea
part
of
it
came
in
learning
to
say
on
the
station
instead
of
at
the
station
the
idea
being
that
the
great
stretch
of
land
on
which
the
station
was
located
was
not
really
land
but
water
and
the
long
wooden
barracks
not
really
barracks
at
all
but
ships
learning
to
sleep
in
a
hammock
it
took
him
a
full
week
learning
to
pin
back
his
sailor
collar
to
save
soiling
the
white
braid
on
it
that
meant
scrubbing
learning
but
why
go
into
detail
one
sentence
covers
it
tyler
met
gunner
moran
moran
tattooed
as
a
gorilla
and
with
something
of
the
sadness
and
humour
of
the
gorilla
in
his
long
upper
lip
and
short
forehead
but
his
eyes
did
not
bear
out
the
resemblance
an
irish
blue
bright
unravaged
clear
beacon
lights
in
a
rough
and
countenance
gunner
moran
was
a
gunner
at
all
or
even
a
gunner
mate
but
just
a
seaman
who
knew
the
sea
from
shanghai
to
new
orleans
from
liverpool
to
barcelona
his
knowledge
of
knots
and
sails
and
rifles
and
bayonets
and
fists
was
a
thing
to
strike
you
dumb
he
was
the
stuff
of
which
officers
are
made
but
you
should
have
seen
him
with
a
springfield
or
a
bayonet
a
bare
moran
but
with
ten
years
sea
experience
into
those
ten
years
he
had
jammed
a
lifetime
of
adventure
and
he
could
do
expertly
all
the
things
that
tyler
kamps
did
amateurishly
in
a
barrack
or
in
a
company
street
the
man
who
talks
the
loudest
is
the
man
who
has
the
most
influence
in
tyler
barrack
gunner
moran
was
that
man
because
of
what
he
knew
they
gave
him
two
hundred
men
at
a
time
and
made
him
company
commander
without
insignia
or
official
position
in
rank
he
was
only
a
gob
like
the
rest
of
them
in
influence
a
captain
moran
knew
how
to
put
the
weight
lunge
behind
the
bayonet
it
was
a
matter
of
balance
of
poise
more
than
of
muscle
up
in
the
front
of
his
men
he
would
yell
whatddye
think
you
doin
tickling
with
a
straw
that
a
bayonet
you
got
there
not
a
tennis
rackit
you
could
scratch
your
initials
on
a
fritz
that
way
put
a
little
guts
into
it
now
then
he
had
been
used
to
the
old
krag
with
a
cam
that
jerked
out
and
threw
back
and
fed
one
shell
at
a
time
the
new
springfield
that
was
a
gloriously
functioning
thing
in
its
simplicity
he
regarded
with
a
sort
of
reverence
and
ecstasy
mingled
as
his
fingers
slid
lightly
caressingly
along
the
shining
barrel
they
were
like
a
man
fingers
lingering
on
the
soft
curves
of
a
woman
throat
the
sight
of
a
rookie
handling
this
metal
sweetheart
clumsily
filled
him
with
fury
whatcha
think
you
got
there
you
lubber
you
a
section
o
lead
pipe
you
ought
t
be
back
carryin
a
shovel
where
you
belong
here
just
a
touch
like
that
see
easy
now
he
could
box
like
a
professional
they
put
him
up
against
slovatsky
the
giant
russian
one
day
slovatsky
put
up
his
two
huge
hands
like
hams
and
his
great
arms
like
iron
beams
and
looked
down
on
this
lithe
agile
bantam
that
was
hopping
about
at
his
feet
suddenly
the
bantam
crouched
sprang
and
recoiled
like
a
steel
trap
something
had
crashed
up
against
slovatsky
chin
red
rage
shook
him
he
raised
his
right
for
a
slashing
blow
moran
was
directly
in
the
path
of
it
it
seemed
that
he
could
no
more
dodge
it
than
he
could
hope
to
escape
an
onrushing
locomotive
but
it
landed
on
empty
air
with
moran
around
in
back
of
the
russian
and
peering
impishly
up
under
his
arm
it
was
like
an
elephant
worried
by
a
mosquito
then
moran
lightning
right
shot
out
again
smartly
and
seemed
just
to
tap
the
great
hulk
on
the
side
of
the
chin
a
ludicrous
look
of
surprise
on
slovatsky
face
before
he
crumpled
and
crashed
this
man
it
was
who
had
tyler
kamps
admiration
it
was
more
than
admiration
it
was
nearer
adoration
but
there
was
nothing
unnatural
or
unwholesome
about
the
boy
worship
of
this
man
it
was
a
legitimate
thing
born
of
all
his
fatherless
years
years
in
which
there
had
been
no
big
man
around
the
house
who
could
throw
farther
than
tyler
and
eat
more
and
wear
larger
shoes
and
offer
more
expert
opinion
moran
accepted
the
boy
homage
with
a
sort
of
surly
graciousness
in
tyler
third
week
at
the
naval
station
mumps
developed
in
his
barracks
and
they
were
quarantined
tyler
escaped
the
epidemic
but
he
had
to
endure
the
boredom
of
weeks
of
quarantine
at
first
they
took
it
as
a
lark
like
schoolboys
moran
hammock
was
just
next
tyler
on
his
other
side
was
a
young
kentuckian
named
dabney
courtney
the
barracks
had
dubbed
him
monicker
the
very
first
day
monicker
had
a
rather
surprising
tenor
voice
moran
a
salty
bass
and
tyler
his
mandolin
the
trio
did
much
to
make
life
bearable
or
unbearable
depending
on
one
musical
knowledge
and
views
the
boys
all
sang
a
great
deal
they
bawled
everything
they
knew
from
oh
you
beautiful
doll
and
over
there
to
the
end
of
a
perfect
day
the
latter
they
even
revived
just
break
the
news
to
mother
and
seemed
to
take
a
sort
of
awful
joy
in
singing
its
dreary
words
and
mournful
measures
they
played
everything
from
a
saxophone
to
a
harmonica
they
read
they
talked
and
they
grew
so
sick
of
the
sight
of
one
another
that
they
began
to
snap
and
snarl
sometimes
they
gathered
round
moran
and
he
told
them
tales
they
only
half
believed
he
had
been
in
places
whose
very
names
were
exotic
and
oriental
breathing
of
sandalwood
and
myrrh
and
spices
and
aloes
they
were
places
over
which
a
boy
dreams
in
books
of
travel
moran
bared
the
vivid
tattooing
on
hairy
arms
and
chest
tattooing
representing
anchors
and
serpents
and
girls
heads
and
hearts
with
arrows
stuck
through
them
each
mark
had
its
story
a
gentleman
indeed
gunner
moran
he
had
an
easy
way
with
him
that
made
you
feel
provincial
and
ashamed
it
made
you
ashamed
of
not
knowing
the
sort
of
thing
you
used
to
be
ashamed
of
knowing
visiting
day
was
the
worst
they
grew
savage
somehow
watching
the
mothers
and
sisters
and
cousins
and
sweethearts
go
streaming
by
to
the
various
barracks
one
of
the
boys
to
whom
tyler
had
never
even
spoken
suddenly
took
a
picture
out
of
his
blouse
pocket
and
showed
it
to
tyler
it
was
a
cheap
little
picture
one
of
the
kind
they
sell
two
for
a
quarter
if
one
sitter
two
for
if
two
this
was
a
twosome
the
boy
and
a
girl
a
healthy
wholesome
looking
girl
who
has
gone
through
high
school
and
cuts
out
her
own
shirtwaists
she
of
the
silver
star
pleasure
club
back
home
the
boy
confided
to
tyler
i
president
we
meet
every
other
saturday
tyler
looked
at
the
picture
seriously
and
approvingly
suddenly
he
wished
that
he
had
tucked
away
in
his
blouse
a
picture
of
a
of
a
pleasure
club
he
took
out
his
mother
picture
and
showed
it
oh
yeh
said
the
boy
disinterestedly
the
dragging
weeks
came
to
an
end
the
night
of
tyler
restlessness
was
the
last
night
of
quarantine
morning
they
would
be
free
at
the
end
of
the
week
they
were
to
be
given
shore
leave
tyler
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
chicago
he
had
never
been
there
five
thirty
reveille
tyler
awoke
with
the
feeling
that
something
was
going
to
happen
something
pleasant
then
he
remembered
and
smiled
dabney
courtney
in
the
next
hammock
was
leaning
far
over
the
side
of
his
perilous
perch
and
delivering
himself
of
his
morning
speech
tyler
did
not
quite
understand
this
young
southern
elegant
monicker
had
two
moods
both
of
which
puzzled
tyler
when
he
awoke
feeling
gay
he
would
lean
over
the
extreme
edge
of
his
hammock
and
drawl
with
an
affected
english
accent
if
this
is
venice
where
are
the
canals
in
his
less
cheerful
moments
he
would
groan
heavily
there
ai
no
gawd
this
last
had
been
his
morning
observation
during
their
many
weeks
of
durance
vile
but
this
morning
he
was
for
the
first
time
in
many
days
enquiring
about
venetian
waterways
tyler
had
no
pal
his
years
of
companionship
with
his
mother
had
bred
in
him
a
sort
of
shyness
a
diffidence
he
heard
the
other
boys
making
plans
for
shore
leave
they
all
scorned
waukegan
which
was
the
first
sizable
town
beyond
the
station
chicago
was
their
goal
they
were
like
a
horde
of
devils
after
their
confinement
six
weeks
of
restricted
freedom
six
weeks
of
energy
made
them
restive
as
colts
goin
to
chicago
kid
moran
asked
him
carelessly
it
was
saturday
morning
yes
are
you
eagerly
kin
a
duck
swim
at
the
they
had
given
him
tickets
to
various
free
amusements
and
entertainments
they
told
him
about
free
canteens
and
about
other
places
where
you
could
get
a
good
meal
cheap
one
of
the
tickets
was
for
a
dance
tyler
knew
nothing
of
dancing
this
dance
was
to
be
given
at
some
kind
of
woman
club
on
michigan
boulevard
tyler
read
the
card
glumly
a
dance
meant
girls
he
knew
that
why
had
he
learned
to
dance
tyler
walked
down
to
the
station
and
waited
for
the
train
that
would
bring
him
to
chicago
at
about
one
the
other
boys
in
little
groups
or
in
pairs
were
smoking
and
talking
tyler
wanted
to
join
them
but
he
did
not
they
seemed
so
sufficient
unto
themselves
with
their
plans
and
their
glib
knowledge
of
places
and
amusements
and
girls
on
the
train
they
all
bought
sweets
from
the
train
butcher
chocolate
maraschinos
and
nut
bars
and
molasses
kisses
and
ate
them
as
greedily
as
children
until
their
hunger
for
sweets
was
surfeited
tyler
found
himself
in
the
same
car
with
moran
he
edged
over
to
a
seat
near
him
watching
him
narrowly
moran
was
not
mingling
with
the
other
boys
he
kept
aloof
his
eyes
gazing
out
at
the
flat
illinois
prairie
all
about
him
swept
and
eddied
the
currents
and
of
talk
they
say
there
a
swell
supper
in
the
tower
building
for
fifty
cents

when
they

it
he
relapsed
into
contemptuous
silence
tyler
who
but
a
moment
before
had
been
envying
them
their
familiarity
with
these
very
things
now
nodded
and
smiled
understanding
at
moran
that
right
he
said
moran
regarded
him
a
moment
curiously
then
he
resumed
his
staring
out
of
the
window
you
would
never
have
guessed
that
in
that
bullet
head
there
was
bewilderment
and
resentment
almost
equalling
tyler
but
for
a
much
different
reason
gunner
moran
was
of
the
old
navy
the
navy
that
had
been
despised
and
spat
upon
in
those
days
his
uniform
alone
had
barred
him
from
decent
theatres
decent
halls
decent
dances
contact
with
decent
people
they
had
forced
him
to
a
knowledge
of
the
burlesque
houses
the
cheap
theatres
the
shooting
galleries
the
saloons
the
dives
and
now
bewilderingly
the
public
had
faced
it
opened
its
doors
to
him
it
closed
its
saloons
to
him
it
sought
him
out
it
offered
him
amusement
it
invited
him
to
its
home
and
sat
him
down
at
its
table
and
introduced
him
to
its
daughter
nix
said
gunner
moran
and
spat
between
his
teeth
not
me
i
pick
me
own
lady
friends
gunner
moran
was
used
to
picking
his
own
lady
friends
he
had
picked
them
in
wicked
port
said
and
in
fiume
in
yokohama
and
naples
he
had
picked
them
unerringly
and
to
his
taste
in
cardiff
and
hamburg
and
vladivostok
when
the
train
drew
in
at
the
great
northwestern
station
shed
he
was
down
the
steps
and
up
the
long
platform
before
the
wheels
had
ceased
revolving
tyler
came
down
the
steps
slowly
blue
uniforms
were
streaming
past
him
a
flood
of
them
white
leggings
twinkled
with
the
haste
of
their
wearers
caps
white
or
blue
flowed
like
a
succession
of
rippling
waves
and
broke
against
the
great
doorway
and
were
gone
in
tyler
town
back
home
in
marvin
texas
you
knew
the
train
numbers
and
their
schedules
and
you
spoke
of
them
by
name
familiarly
and
affectionately
as
number
eleven
and
number
i
reckon
be
late
on
account
of
the
storm
now
he
saw
half
a
dozen
trains
lined
up
at
once
and
a
dozen
more
tracks
waiting
empty
the
great
train
shed
awed
him
the
vast
columned
waiting
room
the
hurrying
people
the
uniformed
guards
gave
him
a
feeling
of
personal
unimportance
he
felt
very
negligible
and
useless
and
alone
he
stood
a
rather
dazed
blue
figure
in
the
vastness
of
that
shining
place
a
voice
the
soft
cadenced
voice
of
the
negro
addressed
him
lookin
fo
de
sailors
club
rooms
tyler
turned
a
toothy
kindly
negro
in
a
uniform
and
red
cap
tyler
smiled
friendlily
here
was
a
human
he
could
feel
at
ease
with

full
of
just
such
faithful
friendly
types
of
negro

grinned
red

how
did
you
know
ah
done
heah
talk
befoh
son
ah
done
heah
talk
it
was
a
long
journey
through
the
great
building
to
the
section
that
had
been
set
aside
for
tyler
and
boys
like
him
tyler
wondered
how
any
one
could
ever
find
it
alone
when
the
red
cap
left
him
after
showing
him
the
wash
rooms
the
tubs
for
scrubbing
clothes
the
steam
dryers
the
the
lunch
room
tyler
looked
after
him
regretfully
then
he
sped
after
him
and
touched
him
on
the
arm
listen
could
i
would
they
do
you
mean
i
could
clean
up
in
there
as
much
as
i
wanted
and
wash
my
things
and
take
a
bath
in
a
bathtub
with
all
the
hot
water
i
want
yo
sho
kin
things
look
mighty
grabby
now
always
is
jes
wait
aroun
an
grab
yo
tyler
waited
and
while
he
waited
he
watched
to
see
how
the
other
boys
did
things
he
saw
how
they
scrubbed
their
uniforms
with
scrubbing
brushes
and
plenty
of
hot
water
and
soap
he
saw
how
they
hung
them
carefully
so
that
they
might
not
wrinkle
in
the
dryers
he
saw
them
emerge
glowing
from
the
tub
rooms
and
he
waited
the
fever
of
cleanliness
burning
in
his
eye
his
turn
came
he
had
waited
more
than
an
hour
reading
listening
to
the
phonograph
and
the
electric
piano
and
watching
now
he
saw
his
chance
and
seized
it
and
then
he
went
through
a
ceremony
that
was
almost
a
ritual
stella
kamps
could
she
have
seen
it
would
have
felt
repaid
for
all
her
years
of
insistence
first
he
washed
out
the
stationary
tub
with
soap
and
brush
and
scalding
water
then
he
scalded
the
brush
then
the
tub
again
then
deliberately
and
with
the
utter
unconcern
of
the
male
biped
he
divested
himself
piece
by
piece
of
every
stitch
of
covering
wherewith
his
body
was
clothed
and
he
scrubbed
them
all
he
took
off
his
white
leggings
and
his
white
cap
and
scrubbed
those
first
he
had
seen
the
other
boys
follow
that
order
of
procedure
then
his
flapping
blue
flannel
trousers
and
his
blouse
then
his
underclothes
and
his
socks
and
finally
he
stood
there
naked
and
unabashed
slim
and
pink
and
silver
as
a
mountain
trout
his
face
as
he
bent
over
the
steamy
tub
was
very
red
and
moist
and
earnest
his
yellow
hair
curled
in
little
damp
ringlets
about
his
brow
then
he
hung
his
trousers
and
blouse
in
the
dryers
without
wringing
them
wringing
he
had
been
told
wrinkled
them
he
rinsed
and
wrung
and
flapped
the
underclothes
though
and
shaped
his
cap
carefully
and
spread
his
leggings
and
hung
those
in
the
dryer
too
and
finally
with
a
deep
sigh
of
accomplishment
he
filled
one
of
the
bathtubs
in
the
adjoining
room
filled
it
to
the
point
with
the
luxurious
hot
water
and
he
splashed
about
in
this
and
reclined
in
it
gloriously
until
the
waiting
ones
threatened
to
pull
him
out
then
he
dried
himself
and
issued
forth
all
flushed
and
rosy
he
wrapped
himself
in
a
clean
coarse
sheet
for
his
clothes
would
not
be
dry
for
another
half
hour
swathed
in
the
sheet
like
a
roman
senator
he
lay
down
on
one
of
the
green
velvet
couches
relics
of
past
pullman
glories
and
there
with
the
rumble
and
roar
of
steel
trains
overhead
with
the
smart
click
of
the
billiard
balls
sounding
in
his
ears
with
the
phonograph
and
the
electric
piano
going
full
blast
with
the
boys
dancing
and
larking
all
about
the
big
room
he
fell
sound
asleep
as
only
a
boy
cub
can
sleep
when
he
awoke
an
hour
later
his
clothes
were
folded
in
a
neat
pile
by
the
deft
hand
of
some
jackie
impatient
to
use
the
drying
space
for
his
own
garments
tyler
put
them
on
he
stood
before
a
mirror
and
brushed
his
hair
until
it
glittered
he
drew
himself
up
with
the
instinctive
pride
and
self
respect
that
comes
of
fresh
clean
clothes
against
the
skin
then
he
placed
his
absurd
round
hat
on
his
head
at
what
he
considered
a
fetching
angle
though
precarious
and
sallied
forth
on
the
streets
of
chicago
in
search
of
amusement
and
adventure
he
found
them
madison
and
canal
streets
west
had
little
to
offer
him
he
sensed
that
the
centre
of
things
lay
to
the
east
so
he
struck
out
along
madison
trying
not
to
show
the
terror
with
which
the
grim
roaring
clamorous
city
filled
him
he
jingled
the
small
coins
in
his
pocket
and
strode
along
on
the
surface
a
blithe
and
carefree
jackie
on
shore
leave
a
forlorn
and
lonely
texas
boy
beneath
it
was
late
afternoon
his
laundering
his
ablutions
and
his
nap
had
taken
more
time
than
he
had
realised
it
was
a
mild
spring
day
with
just
a
lake
michigan
evening
snap
in
the
air
tyler
glancing
about
alertly
nevertheless
felt
dreamy
and
restless
and
sort
of
melting
like
a
in
the
sun
he
wished
he
had
some
one
to
talk
to
he
thought
of
the
man
on
the
train
who
had
said
with
such
easy
confidence
i
got
a
date
tyler
wished
that
he
too
had
a
date
he
who
had
never
had
a
rendezvous
in
his
life
he
loitered
a
moment
on
the
bridge
then
he
went
on
looking
about
him
interestedly
and
comparing
chicago
illinois
with
marvin
texas
and
finding
the
former
sadly
lacking
he
passed
lasalle
clark
the
streets
were
packed
the
noise
and
rush
tired
him
and
bewildered
him
he
came
to
a
moving
picture
theatre
one
of
the
many
that
dot
the
district
a
girl
occupied
the
little
ticket
kiosk
she
was
rather
a
frowsy
girl
not
too
young
and
with
a
certain
look
about
the
jaw
tyler
walked
up
to
the
window
and
shoved
his
money
through
the
little
aperture
the
girl
fed
him
a
pink
ticket
without
looking
up
he
stood
there
looking
at
her
then
he
asked
her
a
question
how
long
does
the
show
take
he
wanted
to
see
the
colour
of
her
eyes
he
wanted
her
to
talk
to
him
a
hour
said
the
girl
and
raised
wise
eyes
to
his
thanks
said
tyler
fervently
and
smiled
no
answering
smile
curved
the
lady
lips
tyler
turned
and
went
in
there
was
an
alleged
comic
film
tyler
was
not
amused
it
was
followed
by
a
war
picture
he
left
before
the
show
was
over
he
was
very
hungry
by
now
in
his
blouse
pocket
were
the
various
information
and
entertainment
tickets
with
which
the
man
had
provided
him
he
had
taken
them
out
carefully
before
he
had
done
his
washing
now
he
looked
them
over
but
a
dairy
lunch
room
invited
him
with
its
white
tiling
and
its
pans
of
baked
apples
and
browned
beans
and
its
coffee
tank
he
went
in
and
ate
a
solitary
supper
that
was
heavy
on
pie
and
cake
when
he
came
out
to
the
street
again
it
was
evening
he
walked
over
to
state
street
the
wrong
side
he
took
the
dance
card
out
of
his
pocket
and
looked
at
it
again
if
only
he
had
learned
to
dance
there
be
girls
there
have
to
be
girls
at
a
dance
he
stood
staring
into
the
red
and
window
display
of
a
cigar
store
turning
the
ticket
over
in
his
fingers
and
the
problem
over
in
his
mind
suddenly
in
his
ear
a
woman
voice
very
soft
and
low
hello
sweetheart
the
voice
said
his
nickname
he
whirled
around
eagerly
the
girl
was
a
stranger
to
him
but
she
was
smiling
friendlily
and
she
was
pretty
too
sort
of
hello
sweetheart
she
said
again
why
said
tyler
texas
fashion
where
you
going
kid
she
asked
tyler
blushed
a
little
well
nowhere
in
particular
just
kind
of
milling
around
come
on
along
with
me
she
said
and
linked
her
arm
in
his
why
why
thanks
but
and
yet
texas
people
were
always
saying
easterners
were
friendly
he
felt
a
little
uneasy
though
as
he
looked
down
into
her
smiling
face
something
hello
sweetheart
said
a
voice
again
a
man
voice
this
time
out
of
the
cigar
store
came
gunner
moran
the
yellow
string
of
a
tobacco
bag
sticking
out
of
his
blouse
pocket
a
freshly
rolled
cigarette
between
his
lips
a
queer
feeling
of
relief
and
gladness
swept
over
tyler
and
then
moran
looked
sharply
at
the
girl
and
said
why
hello
blanche
hello
yourself
answered
the
girl
sullenly
thought
you
was
in
well
i
ai
moran
shifted
his
attention
from
the
girl
to
tyler
friend
o
yours
before
tyler
could
open
his
lips
to
answer
the
girl
put
in
sure
he
is
sure
i
am

been
around
together
all

tyler
jerked
why
i
guess

a
mistake

never

in
my
life
i

of
thought
when

and
spoke
to
me
you
must
be
taking
me
for
somebody
else
well
now
is
that
funny
the
smile
faded
from
the
girl
face
and
it
became
twisted
with
fury
she
glared
at
moran
her
lips
drawn
back
in
a
snarl
who

go
buttin
into
my
business

handkerchief
savagely
she

little
i

this
beat
it
said
moran
he
tucked
his
arm
through
tyler
with
a
little
impelling
movement
and
tyler
found
himself
walking
up
the
street
at
a
smart
gait
leaving
the
girl
staring
after
them
tyler
kamps
was
an
innocent
but
he
was
not
a
fool
at
what
he
had
vaguely
guessed
a
moment
before
he
now
knew
they
walked
along
in
silence
the
most
pair
that
you
might
hope
to
find
in
all
that
city
and
yet
with
a
new
strong
bond
between
them
it
was
more
than
fraternal
it
had
something
of
the
character
of
the
feeling
that
exists
between
a
father
and
son
who
understand
each
other
they
did
not
talk
of
that
which
they
were
thinking
tyler
broke
the
silence
do
you
dance
me
dance
well
i
mixed
with
everything
from
hula
dancers
to
geisha
girls
not
forgettin
the
barbary
coast
in
the
old
days
but
well
i
ai
what

but

tyler
took
out
his
card
again
patiently
this
dance
we
going
to
they
had
reached
the
michigan
avenue
address
given
on
the
card
and
tyler
stopped
to
look
up
at
the
great
brightly
lighted
building
moran
stopped
too
but
for
a
different
reason
he
was
staring
at
tyler
kamps
you
mean
t
say
you
thought
i
was
goin
he
choked
oh
my
gawd
tyler
smiled
at

sweetly
i

of
scared

to
these
dances
and
he
says

of
pretty
girls

alone
but
you

to
dancing
and
parties
and
girls
he
linked
his
arm
through
the
other
man
moran
allowed
himself
to
be
propelled
along
dazedly
still
protesting
he
found
himself
in
the
elevator
with
a
dozen
jackies
at
which
point
moran
game
in
the
face
of
horror
accepted
the
inevitable
he
gave
a
characteristic
jerk
from
the
belt
me
i
try
anything
oncet
lead
me
to
it
the
elevator
stopped
at
the
ninth
floor
out
here
for
the
dance
said
the
elevator
boy
the
two
stepped
out
with
the
others
stepped
out
gingerly
caps
in
hand
a
corridor
full
of
women
a
corridor
with
girls
talk
laughter
animation
in
another
moment
the
two
would
have
turned
and
fled
terrified
but
in
that
of
hesitation
and
bewilderment
they
were
lost
a
woman
approached
them
hand
outstretched
a
tall
slim
friendly
looking
woman
inquiring
she
said
as
if
she
had
been
haunting
the
halls
in
the
hope
of
their
coming
i
glad
to
see
you
you
can
check
your
caps
right
there
do
you
dance
two
scarlet
faces
four
great
hands
twisting
at
white
caps
in
an
agony
of
embarrassment
why
no
that
fine
we
teach
you
then
you
go
into
the
ball
room
and
have
a
wonderful
time
but
in
choked
accents
from
moran
just
a
minute
miss
hall
she
beckoned
a
diminutive
blonde
in
blue
miss
hall
this
is
ah
moran
thanks
and
yes
mr
kamps
tyler
kamps
they
want

right
over
to
you
when
does
your
class
begin
miss
hall
glanced
at
a
toy
watch
on
the
tiny
wrist
instinctively
and
helplessly
moran
and
tyler
focused
their
gaze
on
the
dials
that
bound
their
red
wrists
starting
right
now
said
miss
hall
crisply
she
eyed
the
two
men
with
calm
appraising
gaze
i
sure
you
both
make
wonderful
dancers
follow
me
she
turned
there
was
something
confident
dauntless
irresistible
about
the
straight
little
back
the
two
men
stared
at
it
then
at
each
other
panic
was
writ
large
on
the
face
of
each
panic
and
mutiny
flight
was
in
the
mind
of
both
miss
hall
turned
smiled
held
out
a
small
white
hand
come
on
she
said
follow
me
and
the
two
as
though
hypnotised
followed
a
room
with
a
piano
in
one
corner
and
groups
of
fidgeting
jackies
in
every
other
corner
moran
and
tyler
sighed
with
relief
at
sight
of
them
at
least
they
were
not
to
be
alone
in
their
agony
miss
hall
wasted
no
time
slim
ankles
close
together
head
held
high
she
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room
now
then
form
a
circle
please
twenty
specimens
of
manhood
suddenly
became
shambling
hulks
they
clumped
forward
breathing
hard
and
smiling
mirthlessly
with
an
assumption
of
ease
that
deceived
no
one
least
of
all
themselves
a
little
lively
please
do
look
so
scared
i
not
a
bit
vicious
now
then
miss
weeks
a
fox
trot
miss
weeks
at
the
piano
broke
into
spirited
strains
the
first
faltering
steps
in
the
social
career
of
gunner
moran
and
tyler
kamps
had
begun
to
an
onlooker
it
might
have
been
if
it
had
been
somehow
the
thing
that
little
miss
hall
was
doing
might
have
seemed
trivial
to
one
who
did
not
know
that
it
was
magnificent
it
was
dancing
merely
that
she
was
teaching
these
awkward
serious
frightened
boys
she
was
handing
them
a
key
that
would
unlock
the
social
graces
she
was
presenting
them
with
a
magic
something
that
would
later
act
as
an
open
sesame
to
a
hundred
legitimate
delights
she
was
strictly
business
was
miss
hall
no
nonsense
about
her
and
a
and
a
now
then
all
together
just
four
straight
steps
as
if
you
were
walking
down
the
street
that
it
do
look
at
me
look
at
my
feet
and
a
they
were
very
earnest
pathetically
eager
and
docile
weeks
of
drilling
had
taught
them
to
obey
commands
to
them
the
little
dancing
teacher
whose
white
spats
twinkled
so
expertly
in
the
tangle
of
their
own
clumsy
clumping
boots
was
more
than
a
pretty
girl
she
was
knowledge
she
was
power
she
was
the
commanding
officer
and
like
children
they
obeyed
moran
barbary
coast
experience
stood
him
in
good
stead
now
though
the
stern
and
watchful
miss
hall
put
a
quick
stop
to
a
certain
tendency
toward
shoulder
work
tyler
possessed
what
is
known
as
a
rhythm
sense
an
expert
whistler
is
generally
a
natural
dancer
stella
kamps
had
always
waited
for
the
sound
of
his
cheerful
whistle
as
he
turned
the
corner
of
vernon
street
high
clear
sweet
true
he
would
approach
his
top
note
like
a
tettrazini
until
just
when
you
thought
he
could
not
possibly
reach
that
dizzy
eminence
he
did
reach
it
and
held
it
and
trilled
it
in
defiance
of
the
laws
of
vocal
equilibrium
his
dancing
was
much
like
that
never
a
behind
the
indefatigable
miss
weeks
it
was
a
bit
laboured
at
first
but
it
was
true
little
miss
hall
with
the
skilled
eye
of
the
specialist
picked
him
at
a
glance
you
danced
before
no
take
the
head
of
the
line
please
watch
kamps
now
then
all
together
please
and
they
were
off
again
at
tyler
kamps
and
gunner
moran
were
standing
in
the
crowded
doorway
of
the
ballroom
upstairs
in
a
panic
lest
some
girl
should
ask
them
to
dance
fearful
lest
they
be
passed
by
little
miss
hall
had
brought
them
to
the
very
door
had
left
them
there
with
a
stern
injunction
not
to
move
and
had
sped
away
in
search
of
partners
for
them
gunner
moran
great
scarlet
hands
were
knotted
into
fists
his
apple
worked
convulsively
le
duck
he
whispered
hoarsely
the
jackie
band
in
the
corner
crashed
into
the
opening
bars
of
a
fox
trot
oh
it
do
seem
but
it
was
plain
that
tyler
was
weakening
another
moment
and
they
would
have
turned
and
fled
but
coming
toward
them
was
little
miss
hall
her
blonde
head
bobbing
in
and
out
among
the
swaying
couples
at
her
right
and
left
was
a
girl
her
bright
eyes
held
her
two
victims
in
the
doorway
they
watched
her
approach
and
were
helpless
to
flee
they
seemed
to
be
gripped
by
a
horrible
fascination
their
limbs
were
fluid
a
sort
of
groan
rent
moran
miss
hall
and
the
two
girls
stood
before
them
cool
smiling
unruffled
miss
cunningham
this
is
tyler
kamps
moran
miss
cunningham
miss
drew
moran
mr
kamps
the
boy
and
the
man
gulped
bowed
mumbled
something
would
you
like
to
dance
said
miss
cunningham
and
raised
limpid
eyes
to
tyler
why
i
you
see
i
do
know
how
i
just
started
to
oh
all
right
miss
cunningham
interrupted
cheerfully
we
try
it
she
stood
in
position
and
there
seemed
to
radiate
from
her
a
certain
friendliness
a
certain
assurance
and
understanding
that
was
as
calming
as
it
was
stimulating
in
a
sort
of
daze
tyler
found
himself
moving
over
the
floor
in
time
to
the
music
he
did
know
that
he
was
being
led
but
he
was
she
did
try
to
talk
he
breathed
a
prayer
of
thanks
for
that
she
seemed
to
know
somehow
about
those
four
straight
steps
and
two
to
the
right
and
two
to
the
left
and
four
again
and
he
did
know
that
he
was
counting
aloud
desperately
he
did
even
know
just
then
that
this
was
a
girl
he
was
dancing
with
he
seemed
to
move
automatically
like
a
marionette
he
never
was
quite
clear
about
those
first
ten
minutes
of
his
ballroom
experience
the
music
ceased
a
spat
of
applause
tyler
mopped
his
head
and
his
hands
and
applauded
too
like
one
in
a
dream
they
were
off
again
for
the
encore
five
minutes
later
he
found
himself
seated
next
miss
cunningham
in
a
chair
against
the
wall
and
for
the
first
time
since
their
meeting
the
mists
of
agony
cleared
before
his
gaze
and
he
saw
miss
cunningham
as
a
tall
slim
girl
with
a
glint
of
mischief
in
her
eye
and
a
mouth
that
looked
as
if
she
were
trying
to
keep
from
smiling
why
do
you
tyler
asked
and
was
aghast
why
do
i
what
smile
if
you
want
to
at
which
the
glint
in
her
eye
and
the
hidden
smile
on
her
lips
sort
of
met
and
sparked
and
she
laughed
tyler
laughed
too
and
then
they
laughed
together
and
were
friends
miss
cunningham
conversation
was
the
kind
of
conversation
that
a
nice
girl
invariably
uses
in
putting
at
ease
a
jackie
whom
she
has
just
met
at
a
war
recreation
dance
nothing
could
have
been
more
commonplace
or
unoriginal
but
to
tyler
kamps
the
brilliance
of
a
madame
de
stael
would
have
sounded
trivial
and
uninteresting
in
comparison
where
are
you
from
why
i
from
texas
marvin
texas
is
that
so
so
many
of
the
boys
are
from
texas
are
you
out
at
the
station
or
on
one
of
the
boats
i
on
the
station
yes
do
you
like
the
navy
yes
i
do
i
sure
do
you
know
there
is
a
drafted
man
in
the
navy
no
we
all
enlisted
men
when
do
you
think
the
war
will
end
mr
kamps
he
told
her
gravely
he
told
her
many
other
things
he
told
her
about
texas
at
length
and
in
detail
being
a
true
son
of
that
brobdingnagian
state
your
texan
born
is
a
walking
mass
of
statistics
miss
cunningham
made
a
sympathetic
and
interested
listener
her
brown
eyes
were
round
and
bright
with
interest
he
told
her
that
the
distance
from
texas
to
chicago
was
only
half
as
far
as
from
here
to
there
in
the
state
of
texas
itself
yes
he
had
figures
about
tons
of
grain
and
heads
of
horses
and
herds
of
cattle
why
say
you
could
take
little
ol
germany
and
tuck
it
away
in
a
corner
of
texas
and
you
would
any
more
know
it
was
there
than
if
it
was
somebody
poor
ranch
why
big
y
ranch
alone
would
make
the
whole
country
of
germany
look
like
a
cattle
grazin
patch
it
was
bigger
than
all
those
countries
in
europe
strung
together
and
every
man
in
texas
would
rather
fight
than
eat
yes
why
you
could
hold
my
breathed
miss
cunningham
they
danced
again
miss
cunningham
introduced
him
to
some
other
girls
and
he
danced
with
them
and
they
in
turn
asked
him
about
the
station
and
texas
and
when
he
thought
the
war
would
end
and
altogether
he
had
a
beautiful
time
of
it
and
forgot
completely
and
entirely
about
gunner
moran
it
was
not
until
he
gallantly
escorted
miss
cunningham
downstairs
for
refreshments
that
he
remembered
his
friend
he
had
procured
hot
chocolate
for
himself
and
miss
cunningham
and
sandwiches
and
delectable
chunks
of
caramel
cake
and
they
were
talking
and
eating
and
laughing
and
enjoying
themselves
hugely
and
tyler
had
gone
back
for
more
cake
at
the
urgent
invitation
of
the
woman
presiding
at
the
table
in
the
centre
of
the
charming
room
and
then
he
had
remembered
a
look
of
horror
settled
down
over
his
face
he
gasped
the
matter
demanded
miss
cunningham
my
my
friend
i
forgot
all
about
him
he
regarded
her
with
stricken
eyes
oh
that
all
right
miss
cunningham
assured
him
for
the
second
time
that
evening
we
just
go
and
find
him
he
probably
forgotten
all
about
you
too
and
for
the
second
time
she
was
right
they
started
on
their
quest
it
was
a
short
one
off
the
refreshment
room
was
a
great
gracious
comfortable
room
all
deep
chairs
and
soft
rugs
and
hangings
and
pictures
and
shaded
lights
all
about
sat
pairs
and
groups
of
sailors
and
girls
talking
and
laughing
and
consuming
vast
quantities
of
cake
and
in
the
centre
of
just
such
a
group
sat
gunner
moran
lolling
at
his
ease
in
a
rosy
chair
his
little
finger
was
crookt
elegantly
over
his
cup
a
large
and
imposing
square
of
chocolate
cake
in
the
other
hand
did
not
seem
to
cramp
his
gestures
as
he
talked
neither
did
the
huge
bites
with
which
he
was
rapidly
demolishing
it
seem
in
the
least
to
stifle
his
conversation
four
particularly
pretty
girls
and
two
matrons
surrounded
him
and
as
tyler
and
miss
cunningham
approached
him
he
was
saying
well
it
got
so
i
ca
sleep
in
anything
a
hammick
yessir
why
when
i
was
fifteen
years
old
i
was
he
caught
tyler
eye
hello
he
called
genially
meet
me
friend
this
to
the
bevy
surrounding
him
i
was
just
tellin
these
ladies
here
and
he
was
off
again
all
the
tales
that
he
told
were
not
necessarily
true
but
that
did
not
detract
from
their
thrill
moran
audience
grew
as
he
talked
and
he
talked
until
he
and
tyler
had
to
run
all
the
way
to
the
northwestern
station
for
the
last
train
that
would
get
them
on
the
station
before
shore
leave
expired
moran
on
leaving
shook
hands
like
a
presidential
candidate
i
never
met
up
with
a
finer
bunch
of
ladies
he
assured
them
again
and
again
sure
i
comin
back
again
ask
me
i
had
a
elegant
time
elegant
i
never
met
a
finer
bunch
of
ladies
they
did
not
talk
much
in
the
train
he
and
tyler
it
was
a
sleepy
lot
of
boys
that
that
train
carried
back
to
the
great
central
naval
station
tyler
was
undressed
and
in
his
hammock
even
before
moran
the
expert
he
would
not
have
to
woo
sleep
finally
moran
too
had
swung
himself
up
to
his
precarious
nest
and
relaxed
with
a
tired
happy
grunt
quiet
again
brooded
over
the
great
dim
barracks
tyler
felt
himself
slipping
off
to
sleep
deliciously
she
would
be
there
next
saturday
her
first
name
she
had
said
was
myrtle
an
awful
pretty
name
for
a
girl
just
about
the
prettiest
he
had
ever
heard
her
folks
invited
jackies
to
dinner
at
the
house
nearly
every
sunday
maybe
if
they
gave
him
hours
leave
next
time
hey
sweetheart
sounded
in
a
hissing
whisper
from
moran
hammock
what
say
was
that
four
steps
and
then
or
four
and
two
steps
the
side
i
kinda
forgot
o
shut
up
growled
monicker
from
the
other
side
let
a
fellow
sleep
ca
you
what
do
you
think
this
is
a
boarding
school
shut
up
yourself
retorted
tyler
happily
it
four
steps
and
two
to
the
right
and
two
to
the
left
and
four
again
and
turn
two
turn
two
i
was
pretty
sure
said
moran
humbly
and
relaxed
again
quiet
settled
down
upon
the
great
room
there
were
only
the
sounds
of
deep
regular
breathing
with
an
occasional
grunt
or
sigh
the
normal
sleep
sounds
of
very
tired
boys
the
end
