my
friend
prospero
i
the
coachman
drew
up
his
horses
before
the
castle
gateway
where
their
hoofs
beat
a
sort
of
fanfare
on
the
stone
pavement
and
the
footman
letting
himself
smartly
down
pulled
with
a
peremptory
gesture
that
was
just
not
quite
a
swagger
the
bronze
hand
at
the
end
of
the
dangling
seated
alone
in
her
great
barouche
in
the
sweet
april
weather
lady
blanchemain
gave
the
interval
that
followed
to
a
consideration
of
the
landscape
first
sleeping
in
shadowy
stillness
the
formal
italian
garden
its
terraced
lawns
and
metrical
parterres
its
straight
dark
avenues
of
ilex
its
cypresses
fountains
statues
balustrades
and
then
laughing
in
the
breeze
and
the
sun
the
wild
italian
valley
a
forest
of
blossoming
with
the
river
winding
and
glinting
in
its
midst
with
hills
at
either
side
and
beyond
the
hills
peering
over
their
shoulders
the
of
mountains
crisp
against
the
sky
and
in
the
level
distance
the
hazy
shimmer
of
the
lake
it
is
lovely
she
exclaimed
fervently
in
a
whisper
and
only
a
generation
of
was
her
could
discern
in
it
the
slightest
resemblance
to
the
of
a
theatre
ii
big
humorous
emotional
imperious
but
above
all
interested
and
sociable
lady
blanchemain
do
you
know
her
i
wonder
her
billowy
white
hair
her
handsome
soft
old
face
with
its
smooth
skin
and
the
good
strong
bony
structure
underneath
her
beautiful
old
grey
eyes
full
of
tenderness
and
shrewdness
of
curiosity
irony
indulgence
overarched
and
emphasized
by
regular
black
eyebrows
her
pretty
little
plump
hands
like
two
little
elderly
cupids
with
their
shining
panoply
of
rings
and
her
luxurious
courageous
manner
of
dressing
the
light
colours
and
jaunty
fashion
of
her
gowns
her
laces
ruffles
embroideries
her
gay
little
bonnets
her

linda

do
you
know
her
if
you
do
i
am
sure
you
love
her
and
rejoice
in
her
and
enough
is
said
if
you
do
i
beg
leave
to
present
and
to
commend
her
i
spoke
by
the
bye
of
her
old
face
her
old
eyes
she
is
to
be
sure
in
so
far
as
mere
numbers
of
years
tell
an
old
woman
but
i
once
heard
her
throw
out
in
the
heat
of
conversation
the
phrase
a
young
old
thing
like
me
and
i
thought
she
touched
a
truth
iii
well
then
the
footman
in
his
masterful
way
pulled
the
lady
blanchemain
contemplated
the
landscape
and
had
her
opinion
of
a
generation
that
could
liken
it
to
the
of
a
theatre
and
in
due
process
of
things
the
bell
was
answered
it
was
answered
by
a
man
in
a
costume
that
struck
my
humorous
old
friend
as
pleasing
a
sallow
little
man
whose
otherwise
quite
featureless
suit
of
tweeds
was
embellished
by
scarlet
worsted
with
eyes
from
behind
the
plexus
of
the
grille
he
rather
stolidly
regarded
the
imposing
british
equipage
and
waited
to
be
addressed
lady
blanchemain
addressed
him
in
the
language
of
pistoja
might
one
she
inquired
with
her
air
of
high
affability
in
her
distinguished
old
voice
might
one
visit
the
castle
a
question
purely
of
convention
for
she
had
not
come
hither
without
an
assurance
from
her
however
either
to
flaunt
his
attainments
or
because
indeed
pistoiese
what
though
the
polyglot
races
of
italy
have
agreed
upon
it
as
a
lingua
franca
offered
the
greater
difficulties
to
his
lombardian
tongue
replied
in
french
i
do
not
think
so
madame
was
his
reply
in
a
french
sufficiently
heavy
and
enforced
by
a
dubious
oscillation
of
the
head
lady
blanchemain
black
eyebrows
shot
upwards
marking
her
surprise
then
drew
together
marking
her
determination
but
of
course
one
can
it
in
the
she
insisted
and
held
up
the
volume
the
sceptic
gave
a
shrug
as
one
who
disclaimed
responsibility
and
declined
discussion
me
i
do
not
think
so
but
patience
i
will
go
and
ask
he
said
and
turning
his
back
faded
from
sight
in
the
depths
of
the
dark
vexed
perplexed
lady
blanchemain
fidgeted
a
little
to
have
taken
this
long
drive
for
nothing
sweet
though
the
weather
was
fair
though
the
valley
but
she
was
not
a
person
who
could
let
the
means
excuse
the
end
she
neither
liked
nor
was
accustomed
to
see
her
enterprises
balked
to
see
doors
remain
closed
in
her
face
doors
indeed
had
a
habit
of
flying
open
at
her
approach
besides
the
fellow
manner
his
initial
stare
and
silence
his
tone
when
he
spoke
his
shrug
his
exhortation
to
patience
and
something
too
in
the
conduct
of
his
back
as
he
departed
had
it
lacked
i
do
know
what
of
becoming
deference
to
satisfy
her
at
any
rate
that
the
mistake
if
there
was
a
mistake
sprang
from
no
malapprehension
of
her
own
she
looked
up
chapter
and
verse
yes
there
the
assurance
stood
circumstantial
in
all
the
convincingness
of
the
sturdy
small
black
type
from
roccadoro
a
charming
excursion
may
be
made
up
the
beautiful
val
rampio
to
the
medi√¶val
village
of
sant
alessina
miles
with
its
magnificent
castle
in
fine
grounds
formerly
a
seat
of
the
sforzas
now
belonging
to
the
prince
of
and
containing
the
celebrated
collection
of
paintings
incorporated
in
the
castle
buildings
a
noticeable
peculiarity
are
the
parish
church
and
presbytery
accessible
daily
except
monday
from
to
attendant
fr
so
then
was
wednesday
the
hour
between
two
and
three
so
her
triumphed
but
i
fancy
her
vexation
mounted
iv
i
beg
your
pardon
it
disgraceful
you
should
have
been
made
to
wait
the
porter
is
an
idiot
you
wish
of
course
to
see
the
house
the
english
words
on
a
key
of
spontaneous
apology
with
a
very
zealous
inflection
of
concern
yet
at
the
same
time
with
a
kind
of
entirely
respectful
and
amiable
abruptness
as
of
one
hailing
a
familiar
friend
were
pronounced
in
a
breath
by
a
brisk
cheerful
unmistakably
english
voice
lady
blanchemain
whose
attention
had
still
been
on
the
incriminated
page
looked
quickly
up
and
english
voice
and
spontaneous
apology
notwithstanding
i
wo
vouch
that
the
answer
at
the
tip
of
her
impulsive
tongue
might
have
proved
a
hasty
one
but
the
appearance
gave
her
pause
the
appearance
of
the
tall
smiling
unmistakably
english
young
man
by
whom
had
returned
accompanied
and
who
now
having
pushed
the
grille
ajar
and
issued
forth
stood
placing
himself
with
a
tentative
obeisance
at
her
service
beside
the
carriage
he
was
so
clearly
first
of
all
what
if
it
been
for
her
preoccupation
his
voice
tone
accent
would
have
warned
her
to
expect
so
visibly
a
gentleman
and
then
with
the
even
pink
of
his
complexion
his
yellowish
hair
and
beard
his
alert
friendly
very
blue
blue
eyes
with
his
very
blue
blue
flannels
too
and
his
knitted
tie
he
was
so
vivid
and
so
unusual
his
appearance
gave
her
a
pause
and
in
the
result
she
in
her
turn
almost
apologized
this
wretched
book
she
explained
pathetically
bringing
forward
her
said
that
it
was
open
to
the
public
the
vivid
young
man
hastened
to
put
her
in
the
right
it
is
it
he
eagerly
affirmed
only
he
added
with
a
vaguely
rueful
modulation
and
always
with
that
amiable
abruptness
as
a
man
very
much
at
his
ease
while
his
blue
eyes
whimsically
brightened
only
the
blessed
public
never
comes
we
so
off
the
beaten
path
and
i
suppose
one
must
expect
a
scioccone
his
voice
swelled
on
the
word
and
he
cast
sidelong
a
scathing
glance
at
his
summoner
to
cope
with
unprecedented
situations
will
you
allow
me
to
help
you
out
ah
thought
lady
blanchemain
eton
his
tone
and
accent
now
nicely
appraised
by
an
experienced
ear
eton
yes
and
probably
h
probably
balliol
her
experience
led
her
further
to
surmise
but
what
with
her
insatiable
curiosity
about
people
she
had
of
course
immediately
begun
to
wonder
what
was
an
eton
and
balliol
man
doing
apparently
in
a
position
of
authority
at
this
remote
italian
castle
v
he
helped
her
out
very
gracefully
very
gallantly
and
under
his
guidance
she
made
the
tour
of
the
vast
building
its
greater
court
and
lesser
court
its
cloisters
with
their
faded
frescoes
and
their
marvellous
outlook
northwards
upon
the
alps
its
immense
rotunda
springing
to
the
open
dome
where
the
sky
was
like
an
inset
plaque
of
turquoise
its
staircase
of
honour
guarded
in
an
ascending
file
by
statues
of
men
in
armour
and
then
on
the
its
endless
chain
of
big
empty
silent
splendid
state
apartments
with
their
pavements
of
gleaming
marble
in
patterns
their
painted
and
gilded
ceilings
tapestried
walls
carved
wood
and
moulded
stucco
their
pictures
pictures
pictures
and
their
atmosphere
of
stately
desolation
their
memories
of
another
age
their
reminders
of
the
power
and
pomp
of
people
who
had
long
been
ghosts
he
was
tall
with
that
insatiable
curiosity
of
hers
she
was
of
course
continuously
studying
him
tall
and
but
not
a
bit
rigid
or
inflexible
of
a
figure
indeed
conspicuously
supple
suave
in
its
quick
movements
soft
in
its
energetic
lines
a
figure
that
could
with
equal
thoroughness
be
lazy
in
repose
and
vehement
in
action
his
yellow
hair
was
thick
and
fine
and
if
it
had
been
cropped
so
close
would
have
curled
a
little
his
beard
in
small
crinkly
spirals
did
actually
curl
and
toward
the
edge
its
yellow
burned
to
red
and
his
blue
eyes
were
so
very
very
blue
and
so
very
keen
and
so
very
frank
and
pleasant
they
are
like
sailors
eyes
thought
lady
blanchemain
who
had
a
sentiment
for
sailors
he
carried
his
head
well
thrown
back
as
a
man
who
was
perfectly
sure
of
himself
and
perfectly
unselfconscious
and
thus
unconsciously
he
drew
attention
to
the
vigorous
sweep
of
his
profile
the
decisive
angles
of
his
brow
and
nose
his
voice
was
brisk
and
cheerful
and
masculine
and
that
abruptness
with
which
he
spoke
which
seemed
as
it
were
to
imply
a
previous
acquaintance
was
so
tempered
by
manifest
good
breeding
and
so
coloured
by
manifest
good
will
that
it
became
a
positive
part
and
parcel
of
what
one
liked
in
him
it
was
the
abruptness
of
a
man
very
much
at
his
ease
very
much
a
man
of
the
world
yet
it
was
somehow
in
its
essence
boyish
it
expressed
freshness
sincerity
conviction
a
boyish
wholesale
surrender
of
himself
to
the
business
of
the
moment
it
expressed
perhaps
above
all
a
boyish
thorough
good
understanding
with
his
interlocutor
it
amounts
thought
his
present
interlocutrice
to
a
kind
of
infinitely
sublimated
bluffness
and
then
she
fell
to
examining
his
clothes
his
loose
soft
very
blue
blue
flannels
with
vague
stripes
of
darker
blue
his
soft
shirt
with
its
rolling
collar
his
red
tie
knitted
of
soft
silk
and
tied
in
a
loose
she
liked
his
clothes
and
she
liked
the
way
he
wore
them
they
suited
him
they
were
loose
and
comfortable
and
unconventional
but
they
were
beautifully
fresh
and
well
cared
for
and
showed
him
if
indifferent
to
the
of
the
season
meticulous
in
a
fashion
of
his
own
it
hard
to
imagine
him
dressed
otherwise
she
said
and
instantly
had
a
vision
of
him
dressed
for
dinner
but
what
what
what
was
he
doing
at
castel
sant
alessina
vi
meanwhile
he
plainly
knew
a
tremendous
lot
about
italian
art
lady
blanchemain
herself
knew
a
good
deal
and
could
recognize
a
pundit
he
illumined
their
progress
by
a
running
fire
of
exposition
and
commentary
learned
and
discerning
to
which
she
encouragingly
listened
and
as
occasion
required
amiably
responded
but
boltraffios
bernardino
luinis
even
a
putative
giorgione
could
not
divert
her
mind
from
its
human
problem
what
was
he
doing
at
castel
sant
alessina
the
property
according
to
her
of
an
austrian
prince
what
was
his
status
here
apparently
bar
servants
in
solitary
occupation
was
he
its
tenant
he
could
surely
this
cultivated
young
compatriot
he
could
be
a
mere
employ√©
a
steward
or
curator
no
probably
a
tenant
antecedently
indeed
it
might
seem
unlikely
that
a
young
englishman
should
become
the
tenant
of
an
establishment
so
huge
and
so
sequestered
but
was
it
conceivable
that
this
particular
young
englishman
should
be
a
mere
employ√©
and
was
there
any
other
alternative
she
hearkened
for
a
word
a
note
that
might
throw
light
but
of
such
notes
such
words
a
young
man
conversation
in
the
circumstances
would
perhaps
naturally
yield
a
meagre
crop
you
must
let
me
tire
you
he
said
presently
as
one
who
had
forgotten
and
suddenly
remembered
that
looking
at
pictures
is
exhausting
work
wo
you
sit
here
and
rest
a
little
they
were
in
a
smaller
room
than
any
they
had
previously
traversed
an
octagonal
room
which
a
single
lofty
window
filled
with
sunshine
oh
thank
you
said
lady
blanchemain
and
seated
herself
on
the
circular
divan
in
the
centre
of
the
polished
terrazza
floor
she
really
tired
in
the
least
the
indefatigable
old
but
a
respite
from
would
enable
her
to
turn
the
talk
she
put
up
her
lorgnon
and
glanced
round
the
walls
then
lowering
it
she
frankly
raised
her
eyes
full
of
curiosity
and
kindness
to
her
companion
it
a
surprise
and
a
delightful
one
she
remarked
having
pushed
so
far
afield
in
a
foreign
land
to
be
met
by
the
good
offices
of
a
it
so
nice
of
you
to
be
english
and
her
eyes
softly
changed
their
curiosity
being
veiled
by
a
kind
of
humorous
content
the
young
man
face
from
its
altitude
of
beamed
responsively
down
upon
her
oh
he
laughed
you
must
give
me
too
much
credit
to
be
english
nowadays
is
so
ingloriously
easy
since
foreign
lands
have
become
merely
the
wider
suburbs
of
london
lady
blanchemain
eyes
lighted
approvingly
afterwards
she
looked
half
serious
true
she
discriminated
london
has
spread
pretty
well
over
the
whole
of
europe
but
england
thanks
be
to
goodness
still
remains
mercifully
small
yes
agreed
the
young
man
though
with
a
lilt
of
dubiety
and
a
frown
of
excogitation
as
if
he
were
sure
that
he
had
quite
caught
her
drift
the
mercy
of
it
is
she
smilingly
pointed
out
that
english
folk
decent
ones
have
no
need
to
fight
shy
of
each
other
when
they
meet
as
strangers
we
all
know
more
or
less
about
each
other
by
hearsay
or
about
each
other
people
and
we
all
pretty
sure
to
have
some
common
acquaintances
the
smallness
of
england
makes
for
sociability
and
confidence
it
ought
to
one
would
think
the
young
man
admitted
but
does
it
in
fact
it
had
somehow
got
stuck
in
my
head
that
english
folk
meeting
as
strangers
were
rather
apt
to
glare
we
most
of
us
in
such
a
funk
you
see
lest
if
we
treat
a
stranger
with
civility
he
should
turn
out
not
to
be
a
duke
oh
cried
lady
blanchemain
with
merriment
you
forget
that
i
said
i
meant
of
course
folk
who
dukes
we
all
dukes
or
bagmen
the
young
man
chuckled
but
in
a
minute
he
pulled
a
long
face
and
made
big
ominous
eyes
i
feel
i
ought
to
warn
you
he
said
in
a
portentous
voice
that
some
of
us
are
mere
marquises
of
the
house
of
carabas
lady
blanchemain
her
whole
expansive
person
simmered
with
enjoyment
bless
you
she
cried
those
are
the
ducalest
for
marquises
of
the
house
of
carabas
are
men
of
dash
and
spirit
born
to
bear
everything
before
them
and
to
marry
the
king
daughter
with
that
she
had
a
moment
of
abstraction
again
her
eyeglass
up
she
glanced
round
the
walls
hung
in
this
octagonal
room
with
portraits
of
women
all
in
wonderful
toilets
with
wonderful
hair
and
all
wonderfully
young
and
pleased
with
things
and
all
four
centuries
dead
they
caused
her
a
little
feeling
of
uneasiness
they
were
so
dead
and
silent
and
yet
somehow
in
their
fixed
postures
with
their
unblinking
eyes
their
unvarying
smiles
so
as
it
seemed
to
her
so
watchful
so
intent
and
it
was
a
relief
to
turn
from
them
to
the
window
to
the
picture
framed
by
the
window
of
warm
breathing
heedless
nature
but
all
the
while
in
her
interior
mind
she
was
busy
with
the
man
before
her
he
looks
she
considered
tall
as
he
is
and
with
his
radiant
blondeur
with
the
gold
in
his
hair
and
beard
and
the
in
his
eyes
he
looks
like
a
hero
out
of
some
old
norse
saga
he
looks
his
name
like
odin
i
must
really
compel
him
to
explain
himself
it
very
well
may
be
meantime
that
he
was
reciprocally
busy
with
her
taking
her
in
admiring
her
this
big
jolly
comely
old
woman
all
in
soft
silks
and
drooping
laces
who
had
driven
into
his
solitude
from
heaven
knew
where
and
was
quite
unquestionably
someone
heaven
knew
who
she
had
a
moment
of
abstraction
but
now
emerging
from
it
she
used
her
eyeglass
as
a
pointer
and
indicatively
swept
the
circle
of
painted
eavesdroppers
they
make
one
feel
like
their
grandmother
their
youth
is
so
flagrant
she
sighed
these
grandmothers
of
the
quattrocento
ah
well
we
can
only
be
old
once
and
we
should
take
advantage
of
the
privileges
of
age
while
we
have
old
people
i
am
thankful
to
say
are
allowed
amongst
other
things
to
be
inquisitive
i
brazenly
so
now
if
one
of
our
common
acquaintances
were
at
hand
for
with
england
still
mercifully
small
we
sure
to
possess
a
dozen
you
and
i
what
do
you
think
is
the
question
i
should
ask
him
i
should
ask
him
she
avowed
with
a
pretty
effect
of
hesitation
and
a
smile
that
went
as
an
to
disarm
resentment
to
tell
me
who
you
are
and
all
about
you
and
to
introduce
you
to
me
oh
cried
the
young
man
laughing
he
laughed
for
a
second
or
two
in
the
end
pleasantly
with
a
bow
my
name
he
said
if
you
can
possibly
care
to
know
is
blanchemain
his
visitor
caught
her
breath
she
sat
up
straight
and
gazed
hard
at
him
blanchemain
she
gasped
vii
there
were
to
be
sure
reasons
and
to
spare
why
the
name
should
make
her
sit
up
straight
her
curiosity
had
turned
the
key
and
lo
with
a
click
here
was
an
entirely
changed
immensely
complicated
intensely
poignant
situation
but
our
excitable
old
friend
was
an
englishwoman
dissimulation
would
be
her
second
nature
you
could
trust
her
to
pull
the
wool
over
your
eyes
with
a
fleet
and
practised
hand
instinctively
furthermore
she
would
seek
to
extract
from
such
a
situation
all
the
fun
it
promised
taken
off
her
guard
for
the
span
of
ten
she
sat
up
straight
and
stared
but
with
the
eleventh
her
attitude
relaxed
she
had
regained
her
outward
nonchalance
and
resolved
upon
her
system
of
fence
ah
she
said
on
a
tone
judiciously
compounded
of
feminine
artlessness
and
of
forthright
british
candour
and
with
a
play
of
the
eyebrows
that
attributed
her
momentary
suscitation
to
the
workings
of
memory
of
course
blanchemain
the
sussex
blanchemains
i
expect
there
only
one
family
of
the
name
i
never
heard
of
another
assented
the
young
man
the
ventmere
blanchemains
she
pursued
pensively
lord
blanchemain
of
ventmere
is
your
titled
head
exactly
said
he
i
knew
the
late
lord
blanchemain
i
knew
him
fairly
well
she
mentioned
always
with
a
certain
pensiveness
oh
said
he
politely
interested
yes
said
she
but
i
never
met
his
successor
the
two
were
not
i
believe
on
speaking
terms
of
course
and
her
forthright
british
candour
carried
her
trippingly
over
the
delicate
ground
it
common
knowledge
that
the
family
is
divided
against
itself
hostile
branches
a
protestant
branch
and
a
catholic
the
present
lord
if
i
got
it
right
is
a
catholic
and
the
late
lord
distant
cousin
you
got
it
quite
right
the
young
man
assured
her
with
a
nod
and
a
little
laugh
they
had
the
same
the
last
few
lords
have
been
protestants
but
in
our
branch
the
family
have
never
forsaken
the
old
religion
i
know
said
she
and
was
it
i
heard
the
story
but
i
a
bit
hazy
about
it
was
it
owing
to
your
is
the
word
that
you
lost
the
title
was
there
some
sort
of
sharp
practice
at
your
expense
in
the
last
century
the
young
man
had
another
little
laugh
oh
nothing
he
answered
that
was
very
much
the
fashion
the
late
lord
denounced
his
elder
brother
as
a
papist
and
a
jacobite
nothing
more
than
that
it
was
after
the
so
the
cadet
took
the
title
and
estates
but
with
the
death
of
the
late
lord
a
dozen
years
or
so
ago
the
younger
line
became
extinct
and
the
title
reverted
i
see
said
my
lady
she
knitted
her
eyebrows
computing
after
an
instant
general
blanchemain
she
resumed
as
the
present
lord
was
called
for
the
best
part
of
his
life
is
a
bachelor
you
will
be
one
of
his
nephews
she
raised
her
eyes
inquiringly
the
son
of
his
brother
philip
said
the
young
man
lady
blanchemain
sat
up
straight
again
but
then
she
cried
forgetting
to
conceal
her
perturbation
then
you
the
heir
philip
blanchemain
had
but
one
son
and
was
the
general
immediate
junior
you
john
blanchemain
john
francis
joseph
mary
you
the
heir
the
young
man
smiled
at
her
eagerness
perhaps
the
i
suppose
i
am
he
said
lady
blanchemain
leaned
back
and
gently
tittered
see
how
i
know
my
peerage
she
exclaimed
then
looking
grave
heir
to
an
uncommonly
good
old
title
she
informed
him
i
hope
it
may
be
many
a
long
day
before
i
anything
else
said
he
your
uncle
is
an
old
man
she
suggestively
threw
out
oh
not
so
very
old
he
submitted
only
seventy
or
thereabouts
and
younger
in
many
respects
than
i
am
i
hope
he
live
for
ever
hum
said
she
and
appeared
to
fall
absently
as
it
seemed
and
slowly
she
was
pulling
off
her
gloves
feuds
in
families
she
said
in
a
minute
are
bad
things
why
you
make
it
up
the
young
man
waved
his
hand
a
pantomimic
there
no
one
left
to
make
it
up
with
the
others
are
all
dead
oh
she
wondered
her
eyebrows
elevated
whilst
automatically
her
fingers
continued
to
operate
upon
her
gloves
i
thought
the
last
lord
left
a
widow
i
seem
to
have
heard
of
a
blanchemain
somewhere
the
young
man
gave
still
another
of
his
little
laughs
linda
lady
blanchemain
he
said
yes
one
hears
a
lot
of
her
a
highly
original
character
by
all
accounts
one
hears
of
her
everywhere
linda
lady
blanchemain
lip
began
to
quiver
but
she
got
it
under
control
well
she
questioned
eyes
fixing
his
and
brimming
with
a
kind
of
humorous
defiance
as
if
to
say
think
me
an
impertinent
old
meddler
if
you
will
and
do
your
worst
why
do
you
make
it
up
with
but
he
did
seem
to
mind
the
meddling
in
the
least
he
stood
at
ease
and
plausibly
put
his
case
why
do
i
or
why
does
my
uncle
my
uncle
is
a
temperamental
conservative
a
devotee
to
his
traditions
the
sort
of
man
who
will
never
do
anything
that
has
been
the
constant
habit
of
his
forebears
he
would
no
more
dream
of
healing
a
family
feud
than
of
selling
the
family
plate
and
i
well
surely
it
would
never
be
for
me
to
make
the
advances
no
you
right
acknowledged
lady
blanchemain
the
advances
should
come
from
her
but
people
have
such
a
fatal
way
even
without
being
temperamental
conservatives
of
leaving
things
as
they
find
them
besides
never
having
seen
you
she
could
know
how
nice
you
are
all
the
same
i
confess
if
you
insist
upon
it
that
she
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
come
let
make
it
up
she
rose
a
great
soft
glowing
vision
of
benignancy
and
held
out
her
hand
now
gloveless
her
pretty
little
smooth
plump
right
hand
with
its
twinkling
rings
oh
cried
the
astonished
young
man
the
astonished
amused
moved
wondering
and
entirely
won
young
man
his
eyes
wide
open
and
a
hundred
lights
of
pleasure
and
surprise
dancing
in
them
the
benignant
vision
floated
towards
him
and
he
took
the
little
white
hand
in
his
long
lean
brown
one
viii
when
the
first
stress
of
their
emotion
had
in
some
degree
spent
itself
lady
blanchemain
returning
to
her
place
on
the
ottoman
bade
john
sit
down
beside
her
now
she
said
genially
imperative
whilst
all
manner
of
kindly
and
admiring
interest
shone
in
her
face
there
are
exactly
nine
million
and
questions
that
you
be
obliged
to
answer
before
i
done
with
you
but
to
begin
you
must
clear
up
at
once
a
mystery
that
been
troubling
me
ever
since
you
dashed
to
my
rescue
at
the
gate
what
in
the
name
of
reason
is
the
cause
of
your
residence
in
this
ultramundane
stronghold
john
convict
me
of
damnable
iteration
if
you
must
heaven
has
sent
me
a
laughing
hero
john
laughed
oh
he
said
there
are
several
causes
there
are
exactly
nine
million
and
name
commanded
lady
blanchemain
the
first
and
the
last
well
obeyed
he
pondering
i
should
think
the
first
the
last
and
perhaps
the
chief
intermediate
would
be
the
whole
blessed
thing
and
his
arm
described
a
circle
which
comprehended
the
castle
and
all
within
it
and
the
countryside
without
it
has
a
pleasant
site
i
not
deny
said
lady
blanchemain
but
do
you
find
it
a
trifle
far
away
and
a
bit
i
staying
at
the
victoria
at
roccadoro
and
it
took
me
an
hour
and
a
half
to
drive
here
but
since
said
john
with
a
flattering
glance
since
you
here
i
have
no
further
reason
to
deplore
its
farawayness
so
few
places
are
far
away
in
these
times
and
climes
he
added
on
a
note
of
melancholy
as
one
to
whom
all
climes
and
times
were
known
hum
said
lady
blanchemain
have
you
been
here
long
let
me
see
john
answered
is
the
of
april
i
arrived
here
i
offer
the
fact
for
what
it
may
be
worth
on
the
feast
of
all
fools
cried
she
and
you
intend
to
stay
oh
i
at
least
wise
enough
not
to
fetter
myself
with
intentions
answered
john
she
looked
about
calculating
estimating
i
suppose
it
costs
you
the
very
eyes
of
your
head
she
asked
john
giggled
guess
what
it
costs
i
give
it
to
you
in
a
thousand
she
continued
her
survey
brought
it
to
a
period
a
billion
a
week
she
said
with
finality
john
exulted
it
costs
me
he
told
her
six
francs
fifty
a
day
wine
included
what
cried
she
mistrusting
her
ears
yes
said
he
fudge
said
she
not
to
be
caught
with
chaff
it
sounds
like
a
traveller
tale
i
know
but
that
so
often
the
bother
with
the
truth
said
he
truth
is
under
no
obligation
to
be
i
here
lady
blanchemain
sniffed
does
the
prince
of
take
in
boarders
she
inquired
her
nose
in
the
air
not
exactly
said
john
but
the
parroco
of
sant
alessina
does
i
board
at
the
presbytery
oh
said
lady
blanchemain
beginning
to
see
light
while
her
eyebrows
went
up
went
down
you
board
at
the
presbytery
for
six
francs
fifty
a
day
wine
included
chuckled
john
wine
and
apparently
the
unhindered
enjoyment
of
the
whole
blessed
thing
supplemented
she
with
a
reminder
of
his
comprehensive
gesture
yes
the
run
of
the
house
and
garden
the
freedom
of
the
hills
and
valley
i
understand
she
said
and
was
mute
for
a
space
readjusting
her
impressions
i
had
supposed
she
went
on
at
last
from
the
handsome
way
in
which
you
snubbed
that
creature
in
and
proceeded
to
do
the
honours
of
the
place
that
you
were
little
less
than
its
proprietor
well
and
so
i
could
almost
feel
i
am
laughed
john
i
alone
here
there
none
my
sway
to
dispute
and
as
for
the
creature
in
what
becomes
of
the
rights
of
man
or
the
bases
of
civil
society
if
you
ca
snub
a
creature
whom
you
regularly
tip
for
five
francs
a
week
the
creature
in
cleans
my
boots
indifferent
well
brushes
my
clothes
runs
my
errands
indifferent
slow
and
swallows
my
snubs
as
if
they
were
polenta
and
tries
to
shoo
intrusive
trippers
from
your
threshold
and
gets
an
extra
plateful
for
his
pains
laughed
the
lady
where
she
asked
does
the
prince
of
keep
himself
in
vienna
i
believe
anyhow
at
a
respectful
distance
the
parroco
who
is
also
his
sort
of
intendant
tells
me
he
practically
never
comes
to
sant
alessina
good
easy
man
quoth
she
yes
i
certainly
supposed
you
were
his
at
the
least
you
have
an
air
and
her
bob
of
the
head
complimented
him
upon
it
oh
we
marquises
of
carabas
cried
john
with
a
flourish
she
regarded
him
doubtfully
would
you
find
yourself
in
a
slightly
difficult
position
if
the
prince
or
his
family
should
suddenly
turn
up
she
suggested
i
why
asked
john
his
blue
eyes
blank
a
young
man
boarding
with
the
parroco
for
six
francs
a
day
she
began
six
francs
fifty
please
he
gently
interposed
make
it
seven
if
you
like
her
ladyship
largely
conceded
your
position
be
slightly
false
would
they
quite
realize
who
you
were
what
could
that
possibly
matter
wondered
john
eyes
blanker
still
i
could
conceive
occasions
in
which
it
might
matter
furiously
said
she
foreigners
ca
with
half
an
eye
distinguish
amongst
us
as
we
ourselves
can
and
austrians
have
such
oddly
exalted
notions
you
would
like
to
be
mistaken
for
mr
snooks
i
do
know
john
reflected
vistas
opening
before
him
it
might
be
rather
a
lark
whrrr
said
lady
blanchemain
fanning
herself
with
her
then
she
eyed
him
suspiciously
you
hiding
the
nine
million
other
causes
up
your
sleeve
it
is
merely
the
blessed
thing
that
keeping
an
eaglet
of
your
feather
alone
in
an
improbable
nest
like
this
it
some
one
particular
thing
in
my
time
she
sighed
it
would
have
been
a
woman
and
no
wonder
riposted
john
with
a
flowery
bow
you
very
good
but
you
confuse
the
issue
said
she
in
my
time
the
world
was
young
and
romantic
in
this
age
of
prose
and
prudence
it
a
woman
the
world
is
still
is
always
young
and
romantic
said
john
sententious
i
ca
admit
that
an
age
of
prose
and
prudence
is
possible
the
poetry
of
earth
is
never
dead
and
no
more
is
its
folly
the
world
is
always
romantic
if
you
have
the
three
gifts
needful
to
make
it
so
it
a
woman
repeated
lady
blanchemain
and
the
three
gifts
are
said
he
faith
and
the
sense
of
beauty
and
the
sense
of
humour
and
i
should
have
thought
an
attractive
member
of
the
opposite
sex
said
she
it
a
woman
well
he
at
last
replied
appearing
to
take
counsel
with
himself
i
do
know
why
i
should
forbid
myself
the
relief
of
owning
up
to
you
that
in
a
sense
it
is
hurray
cried
she
moving
in
her
seat
agog
as
one
who
scented
her
pet
diversion
a
love
affair
i
be
your
confidante
tell
me
all
about
it
yes
in
a
sense
a
love
affair
he
confessed
good
excellent
she
approved
but
but
what
do
you
mean
by
a
sense
ah
said
he
darkly
nodding
i
mean
whole
worlds
by
that
i
do
understand
said
she
her
face
prepared
to
fall
it
is
one
woman
it
a
score
a
century
of
the
dear
things
he
announced
her
face
fell
oh
she
faltered
it
a
love
affair
with
a
type
he
explained
she
frowned
upon
him
a
love
affair
with
a
type
yes
said
he
she
shook
her
head
i
give
you
up
in
one
breath
you
speak
like
a
mohammedan
in
the
next
like
i
do
know
what
with
these
said
john
his
band
stretched
towards
the
wall
with
the
type
of
the
quattrocento
he
got
upon
his
feet
and
moved
from
picture
to
picture
and
a
fire
half
indeed
of
mischief
but
half
it
may
be
of
real
enthusiasm
glimmered
in
his
eyes
with
these
lost
ladies
of
old
years
these
shadows
that
were
once
rosy
flesh
these
proud
humble
innocent
subtle
brave
shy
pious
women
of
the
long
ago
with
them
with
their
hair
and
eyes
and
jewels
their
scornful
witty
little
noses
their
so
round
and
lips
so
red
their
splendid
raiment
with
their
mirth
pathos
passion
kindness
and
cruelty
their
infinite
variety
their
undying
youth
ah
the
pity
of
it
their
undying
youth
and
they
so
irrevocably
dead
peace
be
to
their
souls
see
he
suddenly
declaimed
laughing
how
the
sun
the
very
sun
in
heaven
is
contending
with
me
as
to
which
of
us
shall
do
them
the
greater
homage
the
sun
that
once
looked
on
their
living
forms
and
remembers
see
how
he
lights
memorial
lamps
about
them
for
the
sun
reflected
from
the
polished
floor
threw
a
sheen
upon
the
ancient
canvases
and
burned
bright
in
the
bosses
of
the
frames
give
me
these
he
wound
up
a
book
or
two
and
a
jug
of
the
parroco
wine
my
wilderness
is
paradise
enow
lady
blanchemain
eyes
as
she
listened
had
become
deep
wells
of
disappointment
then
gushing
fountains
of
reproach
oh
you
villain
she
groaned
when
he
had
ended
shaking
her
pretty
fist
so
to
have
raised
my
expectations
and
so
to
dash
them
do
you
mean
still
clinging
to
a
shred
of
hope
she
pleaded
really
really
mean
that
there
no
no
actual
woman
i
sorry
said
john
but
i
afraid
i
really
really
do
and
you
not
not
really
in
love
with
any
one
no
not
really
he
said
with
a
mien
that
feigned
contrition
but
at
your
age
how
old
are
you
she
broke
off
to
demand
somewhere
between
and
thirty
i
believe
he
laughed
and
in
such
a
romantic
environment
and
not
on
account
of
a
woman
downright
unnatural
she
declared
it
flat
treason
against
the
kingly
state
of
youth
i
awfully
sorry
said
john
yet
after
all
what
the
good
of
repining
nothing
could
happen
even
if
there
were
a
woman
lady
blanchemain
looked
alarmed
nothing
could
happen
what
do
you
mean
you
not
if
you
are
it
must
be
secretly
for
you
put
down
as
single
in
burke
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
john
reassured
her
laughing
burke
is
right
and
i
prayerfully
trust
he
may
never
have
occasion
to
revise
his
statement
for
mercy
sake
cried
she
do
tell
me
you
a
that
just
the
point
said
he
i
an
adorer
of
the
sex
well
then
questioned
she
at
a
loss
how
can
you
wish
to
remain
a
bachelor
besides
are
you
heir
to
a
peerage
what
of
the
succession
that
just
the
point
he
perversely
argued
and
you
know
there
are
plenty
of
cousins
just
the
point
just
the
point
fretted
lady
blanchemain
what
just
the
point
just
the
point
that
you
are
a
just
the
point
that
you
heir
to
a
peerage
you
talk
like
tom
o
bedlam
well
you
see
expounded
john
unruffled
as
an
adorer
of
the
sex
and
heir
to
a
peerage
i
should
want
to
marry
a
woman
unless
i
could
support
her
in
what
they
call
a
manner
becoming
her
rank
and
i
could
could
the
lady
scoffed
i
should
like
to
know
why
not
i
too
if
you
will
allow
me
to
clothe
my
thought
in
somewhat
homely
language
too
beastly
poor
poor
ejaculated
lady
blanchemain
falling
back
ay
but
honest
asseverated
john
to
calm
her
fears
she
could
help
smiling
though
she
resolutely
frowned
be
serious
she
enjoined
him
does
your
uncle
make
you
a
suitable
allowance
i
should
deceive
you
answered
john
if
i
said
he
made
me
an
one
he
makes
me
to
put
it
in
round
numbers
exactly
no
allowance
whatsoever
the
old
curmudgeon
cried
lady
blanchemain
astounded
and
fiercely
scanning
her
words
no
returned
john
soothingly
he
is
a
curmudgeon
but
he
a
very
peculiar
man
he
a
spartan
and
he
lacks
imagination
it
has
simply
never
entered
his
head
that
i
could
an
allowance
and
if
you
come
to
that
i
ca
say
that
i
positively
do
i
have
a
tiny
patrimony
threepence
a
week
or
so
enough
for
my
humble
necessities
though
scarcely
perhaps
enough
to
support
the
state
of
a
future
peeress
no
my
uncle
is
a
curmudgeon
he
a
very
fine
old
boy
of
whom
immensely
proud
and
though
i
yet
to
see
the
colour
of
his
money
we
quite
the
best
of
friends
at
any
rate
you
agree
that
it
would
be
the
deuce
to
pay
if
i
were
to
fall
in
love
ffff
breathed
lady
blanchemain
fanning
what
did
i
say
of
an
age
of
prose
and
prudence
yet
you
do
what
does
money
matter
go
read
browning
what
true
end
sole
and
single
that
we
here
for
besides
have
you
never
heard
that
there
are
such
things
as
marriageable
heiresses
in
the
world
oh
yes
i
heard
that
john
cheerfully
assented
but
do
they
almost
always
squint
or
something
i
heard
too
that
there
are
such
things
as
tufted
but
theirs
is
a
career
that
requires
a
special
vocation
and
i
afraid
i
have
got
it
then
you
no
true
marquis
of
carabas
the
lady
took
him
smartly
up
you
found
me
out
i
only
a
he
laughed
thrrr
breathed
lady
blanchemain
and
for
a
little
while
appeared
lost
in
thought
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
out
i
never
saw
a
lovelier
landscape
she
said
musingly
with
the
grey
hills
and
the
and
the
brilliant
sky
with
the
golden
light
and
the
purple
shadows
and
the
cypresses
and
olives
with
the
river
gleaming
below
there
amongst
the
and
is
that
a
blackcap
singing
in
the
mimosa
it
only
needs
a
pair
of
lovers
to
be
perfect
it
for
a
pair
of
lovers
and
instead
of
them
i
find
what
a
hermit
and
celibate
look
here
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
you
she
asked
from
over
her
shoulder
john
merely
giggled
it
would
serve
you
right
said
she
truculently
if
some
one
were
to
rub
your
eyes
with
to
make
you
dote
upon
the
next
live
creature
that
you
see
john
merely
chuckled
i
tell
you
what
she
proceeded
i
a
bit
of
an
old
witch
and
i
risk
a
soothword
as
there
is
already
a
woman
there
shortly
be
one
my
thumbs
prick
the
stage
is
set
the
scene
is
too
appropriate
the
play
inevitable
it
was
never
in
the
will
of
providence
that
a
youth
of
your
complexion
should
pass
the
springtime
in
a
spot
all
teeming
with
romance
like
this
and
miss
a
love
adventure
a
castle
in
a
garden
a
flowering
valley
and
the
italian
sky
the
italian
sun
and
moon
your
portraits
of
these
smiling
dead
women
too
if
you
like
to
keep
your
imagination
working
and
blackcaps
singing
in
the
mimosa
no
no
the
lady
of
the
piece
is
waiting
in
the
wings
my
thumbs
prick
give
her
but
the
least
excuse
she
enter
and
good
heavens
my
prophetic
soul
she
suddenly
with
a
sort
of
catch
in
her
throat
broke
off
she
turned
and
faced
him
cheeks
flushed
eyes
flashing
oh
you
hypocrite
you
monstrous
fibber
she
cried
on
a
tone
of
jubilation
looking
daggers
why
what
up
what
the
matter
asked
john
at
fault
how
you
have
humbugged
me
so
she
wailed
in
delight
reverting
to
the
window
anyhow
she
charming
she
made
for
the
part
i
could
pray
for
a
more
promising
heroine
she
who
asked
he
crossing
to
her
side
who
fie
you
slyboots
she
crowed
with
glee
ah
i
see
said
john
for
below
them
in
the
garden
just
beyond
the
mimosa
all
powdered
with
fresh
gold
where
the
blackcap
was
singing
stood
a
woman
ix
she
stood
in
the
path
beside
a
from
which
she
appeared
to
be
taking
the
time
of
day
a
crumbling
ancient
thing
of
grey
stone
green
and
brown
with
mosses
and
she
was
smiling
pleasantly
to
herself
the
while
all
unaware
of
the
couple
who
watched
her
from
above
she
wore
a
and
was
as
one
belonging
to
the
place
she
was
young
two
or
three
and
twenty
by
her
aspect
young
slender
of
an
excellent
height
and
i
hope
you
would
have
agreed
a
beautiful
countenance
she
studied
the
and
smiled
and
what
with
her
dark
eyes
and
softly
chiselled
features
the
pale
rose
in
her
cheeks
and
the
deeper
rose
of
her
mouth
with
her
hair
too
almost
black
in
shadow
but
where
the
sun
touched
it
turning
to
sombre
red
yes
i
think
you
would
have
agreed
that
she
was
beautiful
lady
blanchemain
at
any
rate
found
her
so
she
quite
lovely
she
declared
her
face
is
exquisite
so
sensitive
so
spiritual
so
distinguished
so
aristocratic
and
so
she
added
after
a
suspension
mm
said
john
his
forehead
wrinkled
as
if
something
were
puzzling
him
she
has
a
figure
she
holds
herself
well
said
lady
blanchemain
mm
said
john
i
suppose
said
she
you
too
much
a
mere
man
to
be
able
to
appreciate
her
frock
it
the
work
of
a
dressmaker
who
knows
her
business
and
that
lilac
muslin
that
so
fashionable
now
really
does
in
the
open
air
with
the
country
for
background
show
to
immense
advantage
come
out
with
it
tell
me
all
about
her
who
she
that
just
what
i
up
a
tree
to
think
said
john
i
ca
imagine
how
long
has
she
been
there
from
what
direction
did
she
come
do
try
to
hoodwink
me
any
longer
remonstrated
the
lady
unbelieving
i
never
in
my
life
set
eyes
on
her
before
he
solemnly
averred
she
scrutinized
him
sharply
hand
on
heart
she
doubted
and
he
supporting
her
scrutiny
without
flinching
answered
hand
on
heart
well
then
concluded
she
with
a
laugh
it
looks
as
if
i
were
even
more
of
an
old
witch
than
i
boasted
and
my
thumbs
pricked
to
some
purpose
here
the
lady
of
the
piece
already
arrived
there
going
away
how
well
she
walks
have
after
her
have
after
her
quick
and
begin
your
courtship
the
smiling
young
woman
her
lilac
dress
softly
bright
in
the
sun
was
moving
slowly
down
the
garden
path
towards
the
cloisters
and
now
she
entered
them
and
disappeared
but
john
instead
of
having
after
her
remained
at
his
counsellor
side
and
watched
she
came
from
that
low
doorway
beyond
there
at
the
right
where
the
two
cypresses
are
and
she
came
at
the
very
climax
of
my
vaticination
said
her
ladyship
without
a
hat
you
hardly
dispute
it
probable
she
staying
in
the
house
no
it
certainly
would
seem
so
said
john
i
all
up
a
tree
the
garden
looks
rather
dreary
and
empty
now
that
she
has
left
does
it
she
asked
yet
it
looked
jolly
enough
before
her
advent
and
see
the
lizards
there
are
four
of
them
are
there
that
whisked
away
from
the
dial
at
her
approach
have
come
back
well
work
cut
out
i
suppose
it
would
be
possible
for
you
to
give
a
poor
woman
a
dish
of
tea
i
was
on
the
very
point
of
proposing
it
said
john
may
i
conduct
you
to
my
quarters
part
second
i
rather
early
next
morning
john
was
walking
among
the
olives
he
had
gone
straight
from
his
bed
and
in
perhaps
the
least
considered
of
toilets
an
old
frieze
ulster
ornamented
with
big
buttons
of
a
pair
of
turkish
slippers
a
over
his
shoulder
and
for
just
his
uncombed
native
thatch
he
had
gone
for
a
swim
some
half
a
mile
upstream
to
a
place
he
knew
where
the
rampio
the
madcap
rampio
all
shallows
and
rapids
rests
for
a
moment
in
a
pool
wide
and
deep
translucent
inviting
and
as
you
perceive
when
you
have
made
your
plunge
of
a
most
assertive
chill
now
he
was
on
his
leisurely
way
home
to
the
presbytery
and
what
passed
there
for
breakfast
the
rose
from
the
river
bank
in
a
series
of
irregular
terraces
upheld
by
rough
stone
walls
the
gnarled
old
trees
bent
towards
each
other
and
away
like
dwarfs
and
dancing
a
fantastic
minuet
and
in
the
grass
beneath
them
where
the
sun
shot
his
fiery
darts
and
cast
his
net
of
shadows
chloris
had
scattered
innumerable
wildflowers
hyacinths
the
colour
of
the
sky
violets
that
threaded
the
air
for
yards
about
with
their
fragrance
tulips
red
and
yellow
sometimes
a
tall
imperial
iris
here
and
there
little
white
nodding
companies
of
jonquils
here
and
there
too
the
reaches
were
pointed
by
the
dark
spire
of
a
cypress
alone
in
a
kind
of
glooming
isolation
here
and
there
a
blossoming
peach
or
almond
gaily
pink
sent
an
inexpressible
little
thrill
of
gladness
to
one
heart
the
air
was
sweetened
by
many
things
besides
the
violets
by
moss
and
bark
the
grass
the
moist
brown
earth
and
it
was
quick
with
music
bees
droned
leaves
whispered
birds
called
sang
gossiped
disputed
and
the
rampio
played
a
crystal
accompaniment
john
swung
onwards
at
ease
while
lizards
with
tails
that
seemed
extravagantly
long
fled
from
before
his
feet
terrible
to
them
no
doubt
as
an
army
with
banners
for
his
turkish
slippers
though
not
in
their
pristine
youth
were
of
scarlet
leather
embroidered
in
a
rich
device
with
gold
and
presently
an
experience
unusual
at
that
hour
in
the
olive
wood
he
became
aware
of
a
human
voice
oh√©
my
good
men
there
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
gather
me
some
of
those
anemones
here
is
a
lira
for
your
pains
it
was
a
feminine
voice
it
was
youthful
and
melodious
it
was
finished
polished
delicately
modulated
and
its
inflection
was
at
once
confident
and
gracious
clearly
the
speaker
took
it
for
granted
that
she
would
receive
attention
and
she
implied
her
thanks
abundantly
beforehand
it
was
a
voice
that
evoked
in
the
imagination
a
charming
picture
of
fresh
young
confident
and
gracious
womanhood
hello
said
john
to
himself
who
is
there
in
this
part
of
the
world
with
a
voice
like
that
and
he
felt
it
would
not
be
surprising
if
on
glancing
round
he
should
behold
as
in
fact
he
did
the
stranger
of
yesterday
the
unknown
of
the
garden
ii
she
stood
on
one
of
the
higher
terraces
a
very
charming
picture
indeed
bright
and
erect
in
the
warm
shadow
of
the
olives
and
was
calling
down
to
a
couple
of
peasants
at
work
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
between
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
an
ungloved
fair
right
hand
she
held
up
a
silver
lira
anemones
said
she
near
to
where
the
men
were
working
by
the
brink
there
was
a
space
of
level
ground
perhaps
a
hundred
feet
long
and
tapering
from
half
that
breadth
to
a
point
and
this
was
simply
crimson
and
purple
with
a
countless
host
of
anemones
she
called
to
the
men
and
one
seeing
and
hearing
her
would
have
thought
they
must
abandon
everything
and
spring
to
do
her
bidding
but
they
did
pausing
only
long
enough
to
give
her
a
phlegmatic
stare
as
if
in
doubt
whether
conceivably
she
could
have
the
impertinence
to
be
addressing
and
vouchsafing
not
a
word
each
went
calmly
on
with
his
employment
very
very
calmly
gently
languidly
filling
small
baskets
with
fallen
olives
and
emptying
them
upon
outspread
canvas
sheets
there
are
and
more
the
pity
two
types
of
italian
peasant
there
the
old
type
which
we
knew
in
our
youth
and
happily
it
still
survives
in
some
numbers
the
peasant
who
for
all
his
rags
and
tatters
has
manners
that
will
often
put
one
own
to
shame
and
with
a
like
is
before
one
wishes
in
his
eagerness
to
serve
and
please
and
there
is
the
new
type
which
we
know
to
our
disgust
and
unhappily
it
multiplies
like
vermin
the
peasant
who
has
lent
his
ear
to
the
social
democrat
and
his
heart
envenomed
by
class
hatred
meets
your
civility
with
black
glances
and
the
behaviour
of
a
churl
in
the
sulks
so
though
her
voice
was
sweet
to
hear
and
though
standing
there
in
the
warm
penumbra
of
the
olive
orchard
tall
and
erect
and
graceful
in
her
bright
frock
she
made
a
charming
picture
and
though
she
offered
a
silver
lira
as
a
prize
the
men
merely
stared
at
her
churlishly
and
went
on
with
their
work
languidly
sluggishly
as
men
who
deemed
the
necessity
to
work
an
outrage
and
were
going
to
condone
it
by
working
with
anything
like
a
will
now
john
blanchemain
as
i
have
previously
mentioned
was
an
unselfconscious
sort
of
fellow
in
his
unselfconsciousness
forgetting
several
trifles
that
might
properly
have
weighed
with
him
forgetting
the
tarnished
gorgeousness
of
his
turkish
slippers
for
example
and
his
towzled
head
and
the
that
flowed
like
a
piece
of
classic
drapery
from
his
shoulder
obeying
impulse
and
instinct
he
flung
himself
into
the
breach
brutes
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
then
in
his
easiest
accents
if
you
can
wait
two
minutes
he
called
aloud
to
her
and
therewith
he
went
scrambling
down
the
terraces
and
picked
his
way
from
stone
to
stone
across
the
shallows
to
the
field
of
anemones
where
their
satiny
petals
like
crisping
wavelets
all
in
the
moving
air
shimmered
with
constantly
changing
lights
and
in
a
twinkling
he
had
gathered
a
great
armful
and
was
clambering
back
i
beg
of
you
he
said
in
his
abrupt
fashion
holding
them
out
to
her
and
slightly
bowing
with
that
assurance
of
his
while
his
blue
eyes
to
put
her
entirely
at
her
ease
smiled
frank
and
friendly
and
serene
into
her
dark
ones
but
hers
seemed
troubled
she
looked
at
the
flowers
she
looked
at
john
i
think
she
even
looked
at
her
lira
her
eyes
seemed
undecided
do
pray
take
them
said
he
still
smiling
still
frank
and
assured
but
as
if
a
little
puzzled
a
little
amused
by
her
hesitation
and
more
airily
a
than
ever
his
tone
one
of
high
detachment
to
spare
her
any
possible
feeling
of
personal
obligation
and
to
place
his
performance
in
the
light
of
a
matter
of
course
as
if
indeed
he
had
done
nothing
more
than
pick
up
and
return
say
a
handkerchief
she
might
have
dropped
you
were
right
he
owned
to
his
thought
of
lady
blanchemain
she
is
beautiful
here
at
close
quarters
with
her
perception
of
her
beauty
became
acute
here
under
the
grey
old
trees
in
the
leafy
dimness
alone
with
her
at
two
paces
from
her
where
the
birds
sang
and
the
violets
gave
forth
their
fragrant
breath
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
beautiful
soft
and
deep
and
luminous
despite
their
trouble
and
her
low
white
brow
and
the
dark
masses
of
her
hair
under
her
and
the
rose
in
her
cheeks
and
the
of
her
mouth
and
he
saw
and
felt
the
beauty
and
the
vitality
of
her
strong
young
body
but
meanwhile
she
had
stretched
forth
rather
timidly
that
ungloved
fair
hand
of
hers
and
taken
the
flowers
you
are
very
good
i
am
sure
thank
you
very
much
she
said
rather
faintly
with
a
grave
little
inclination
of
the
head
john
always
with
magnificent
assurance
put
up
his
hand
to
doff
a
hat
and
bow
himself
away
and
it
encountered
his
bare
locks
bare
and
still
wet
from
recent
ducking
whereupon
suddenly
the
trifles
he
had
forgotten
were
remembered
and
at
last
in
the
formula
of
the
criminologist
he
realized
his
position
hatless
and
uncombed
with
the
slung
from
his
shoulder
in
that
old
frieze
coat
with
its
ridiculous
buttons
in
those
awful
turkish
slippers
offering
with
his
grand
manner
flowers
to
a
woman
he
did
know
and
smiling
to
put
her
at
her
ease
his
pink
face
burned
to
a
livelier
pink
his
ears
went
hot
his
heart
went
cold
the
bow
he
finally
accomplished
was
the
blighted
bud
of
the
bow
he
had
projected
and
as
the
earth
did
of
its
charity
open
and
engulf
him
he
hastened
as
best
he
could
and
with
a
painful
sense
of
slinking
to
remove
his
crestfallen
person
from
her
range
of
view
when
these
unselfconscious
fellows
are
startled
into
selfconsciousness
i
fancy
they
take
it
hard
i
do
know
how
long
it
was
before
john
had
done
heaping
silent
curses
silent
but
savage
upon
himself
his
luck
his
beastly
officiousness
upon
the
whole
afflicting
incident
curses
that
he
could
help
diversifying
now
and
then
with
a
catch
of
splenetic
laughter
as
a
vision
of
the
figure
he
had
cut
would
recurrently
upon
that
inward
eye
which
is
the
bliss
of
oh
you
he
groaned
rigged
out
like
pudding
jack
and
with
your
ineffable
simagrees
offering
a
strange
woman
flowers
if
had
only
laughed
had
only
smiled
it
would
have
been
so
bad
it
would
have
shown
that
she
understood
but
through
it
all
he
writhed
to
recollect
she
was
as
solemn
as
a
mourner
i
suppose
she
was
shocked
perhaps
she
was
frightened
very
likely
she
took
me
for
a
tramp
i
wonder
she
did
crown
my
beatitude
by
giving
me
her
lira
these
foreigners
do
so
lack
certain
discernments
and
with
that
rather
an
odd
detail
came
back
to
him
she
a
foreigner
for
it
came
vaguely
back
that
he
impulsive
and
unthinking
had
spoken
to
her
throughout
in
english
and
anyhow
this
came
distinctly
back
it
was
certainly
in
english
that
she
thanked
me
iii
what
passed
for
breakfast
at
the
presbytery
was
the
usual
continental
evasion
of
that
repast
bread
and
coffee
despatched
in
your
apartment
but
at
noon
the
household
met
to
dine
the
on
the
ground
floor
long
and
low
with
a
vaulted
ceiling
whitewashed
and
a
pavement
of
worn
red
tiles
was
a
clean
bare
room
that
pervaded
by
a
curious
dry
not
unpleasant
odour
seemed
actually
to
smell
of
bareness
as
well
as
of
cleanliness
there
was
a
table
there
was
a
dresser
there
were
a
few
unpainted
deal
chairs
exactly
like
the
chairs
in
the
church
in
all
italian
churches
and
there
was
absolutely
nothing
else
save
a
great
black
and
white
crucifix
attached
to
the
wall
but
by
way
of
compensation
its
windows
opened
southwards
flooding
it
with
sunshine
and
commanding
the
wonderful
perspective
of
the
valley
the
hills
the
the
blossoming
and
the
opalescence
that
you
knew
to
be
the
lake
at
noon
the
parroco
his
niece
annunziata
and
his
boarder
met
to
dine
the
parroco
was
a
short
stout
florid
still
youngish
man
if
may
be
reckoned
youngish
with
a
pair
of
thin
lips
and
powerful
jaws
which
for
purposes
of
speech
he
never
opened
if
he
could
help
it
never
till
sunday
came
when
mounting
the
pulpit
he
opened
them
indeed
and
his
utterance
burst
forth
in
a
perfect
torrent
of
a
sermon
a
wild
gush
of
words
shouted
at
the
topmost
stress
of
a
remarkably
lusty
voice
arresting
for
a
minute
or
two
by
reason
of
the
sheer
physical
energy
it
represented
and
then
for
a
long
half
hour
exquisitely
tiresome
but
on
he
maintained
a
prodigious
silence
and
this
as
though
he
was
in
the
least
really
fierce
it
would
often
be
john
malicious
study
to
tempt
him
to
break
besides
john
was
honestly
concerned
with
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
accordingly
grace
being
said
you
never
told
me
he
began
assuming
a
mien
of
intelligent
interest
that
the
castle
was
haunted
he
looked
at
the
napoleonic
profile
of
don
ambrogio
but
from
the
tail
of
his
eye
he
kept
a
watch
as
well
upon
annunziata
and
he
saw
that
that
wise
little
maiden
became
attentive
no
said
don
ambrogio
between
two
spoonfuls
of
soup
you
will
conceive
my
astonishment
then
continued
john
urbanely
when
i
discovered
that
it
was
it
is
said
don
ambrogio
he
gave
himself
diligently
to
the
business
of
the
hour
his
spoon
flew
backwards
and
forwards
like
a
shuttle
his
napkin
tucked
into
his
roman
collar
protected
his
bosom
an
effective
white
cuirass
oh
not
the
castle
questioned
john
only
the
garden
and
the
olive
wood
true
on
reflection
i
never
seen
it
in
the
house
nothing
here
is
haunted
said
the
parroco
he
made
a
signal
to
annunziata
who
rose
to
change
the
plates
her
big
eyes
were
alight
her
serious
little
face
was
alert
but
she
would
never
dream
of
speaking
in
the
presence
of
her
uncle
marcella
the
cook
brought
in
the
inevitable
veal
oh
for
that
insisted
john
courteous
but
firm
i
beg
your
pardon
i
myself
have
seen
it
on
two
occasions
and
lest
you
should
fancy
it
a
subjective
illusion
i
may
tell
you
that
it
was
yesterday
seen
simultaneously
by
another
it
it
what
is
asked
the
parroco
his
beaked
and
ensanguined
visage
than
ever
as
he
fell
upon
the
inevitable
veal
with
a
somewhat
dull
ah
said
john
now
you
make
me
regret
that
i
have
a
talent
for
it
the
form
of
a
woman
a
young
woman
tall
slender
in
some
pale
diaphanous
garment
that
appears
here
appears
there
remaining
distinctly
visible
for
some
minutes
and
then
disappears
no
it
is
a
subjective
illusion
and
it
is
either
the
unscrupulous
creature
added
after
a
pause
raising
his
voice
and
speaking
with
emphasis
as
if
to
repel
the
insinuation
while
the
darkness
of
disenchantment
swept
the
face
of
annunziata
it
is
either
as
some
imaginative
people
might
too
hastily
conclude
a
wraith
a
phantom
an
insubstantial
vapour
it
a
real
material
form
that
lives
and
breathes
and
even
if
driven
to
it
speaks
there
nothing
supernatural
about
it
unless
indeed
we
take
the
transcendental
view
that
nature
herself
is
supernatural
i
was
wondering
don
ambrogio
whether
without
violating
a
confidence
you
could
tell
me
whose
form
it
is
nossignore
said
don
ambrogio
economizing
his
breath
ah
sighed
john
nodding
resignedly
i
feared
as
much
divining
that
i
would
institute
inquiries
she
has
stolen
a
march
upon
me
and
pledged
you
to
secrecy
nossignore
disavowed
don
ambrogio
raising
eyes
the
sincerity
of
which
there
could
be
no
suspecting
john
face
took
on
an
expression
of
aggrieved
surprise
but
then
why
wo
you
tell
me
i
can
not
tell
you
because
i
do
not
know
said
don
ambrogio
oh
i
see
said
john
and
yet
he
argued
meditatively
that
hard
to
conceive
i
do
for
a
moment
mean
that
i
doubt
it
but
it
hard
to
conceive
like
the
atomic
theory
and
some
of
the
articles
of
religion
i
hear
that
the
scientists
are
throwing
the
atomic
theory
over
oh
fickle
scientists
oh
shifting
sands
of
science
surely
there
ca
be
many
such
tall
slender
forms
in
diaphanous
garments
appearing
and
disappearing
here
and
there
in
your
parish
and
one
would
suppose
antecedently
that
you
know
them
all
a
peasant
a
villager
said
don
ambrogio
i
put
it
to
you
as
an
observer
of
life
said
john
do
peasants
do
villagers
wear
diaphanous
garments
a
visitor
a
from
some
place
on
the
lake
said
don
ambrogio
i
put
it
to
you
as
a
student
of
probabilities
said
john
would
a
visitor
would
a
from
some
place
on
the
lake
walk
in
the
garden
of
the
castle
without
a
hat
and
would
she
appear
at
alessina
on
two
days
in
succession
but
don
ambrogio
had
finished
his
veal
and
when
he
had
finished
his
veal
he
always
left
the
table
first
twice
devoutly
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
then
with
a
bow
to
john
pronouncing
the
formula
you
will
graciously
permit
my
affairs
call
me
a
thousand
regrets
he
slightly
amplified
that
formula
a
thousand
regrets
he
said
and
as
many
excuses
for
my
inability
to
afford
the
information
desired
after
his
departure
john
turned
to
annunziata
where
in
her
grey
cotton
pinafore
her
lips
parted
her
big
eyes
two
lively
points
of
interrogation
she
sat
opposite
to
him
impatient
to
take
up
the
theme
well
mistress
wisdom
he
saluted
her
smiling
and
waving
his
hand
it
is
a
good
and
wholesome
thing
for
the
young
to
witness
the
discomfiture
of
the
wicked
your
uncle
retreats
with
flying
colours
he
made
to
be
sure
a
slender
dinner
but
that
his
daily
habit
if
you
have
tears
to
shed
shed
them
for
me
i
have
made
none
at
all
from
points
of
interrogation
annunziata
eyes
changed
to
abysses
of
wonder
and
big
as
they
were
seemed
to
grow
measurably
bigger
you
have
made
no
dinner
she
protested
in
that
strangely
deep
voice
of
hers
with
its
effect
of
immense
solemnity
no
poor
dear
said
john
with
pathos
no
i
have
made
no
dinner
but
you
have
eaten
a
great
deal
exclaimed
annunziata
frowning
nonplussed
and
you
are
still
eating
quite
so
responded
john
though
i
think
it
perhaps
the
merest
trifle
unhandsome
of
you
to
fling
it
in
my
face
i
have
eaten
a
great
deal
and
i
am
still
eating
that
is
what
i
come
to
table
for
in
an
orderly
life
like
mine
there
is
a
place
for
everything
i
come
to
table
to
eat
just
as
i
go
to
bed
to
sleep
and
to
church
to
say
my
prayers
would
you
have
me
sleep
at
table
eat
in
church
and
say
my
prayers
in
bed
eating
however
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
i
spoke
of
dining
i
said
i
had
not
dined
now
you
shall
be
the
judge
the
question
is
can
a
christian
man
dine
twice
on
the
same
day
answer
me
that
oh
no
answered
annunziata
her
pale
face
very
sober
and
she
lengthened
out
her
vowels
in
deprecation
of
the
idea
at
least
it
would
be
gluttony
if
he
did
there
you
are
cried
john
and
gluttony
is
not
the
undeadliest
of
the
seven
deadly
sins
so
then
unless
you
would
have
me
guilty
of
the
deadly
sin
of
gluttony
you
must
agree
that
i
have
not
dined
for
i
am
going
to
dine
this
evening
i
am
going
to
dine
at
the
hotel
victoria
at
roccadoro
i
am
going
to
dine
with
a
lady
i
am
going
to
dine
in
all
the
pomp
and
circumstance
of
my
with
a
white
tie
and
pumps
and
you
yourself
have
said
it
a
christian
man
may
not
without
guilt
of
gluttony
dine
twice
on
the
same
day
therefore
it
is
the
height
of
uncharitableness
it
a
deliberate
imputation
of
sin
to
contend
that
i
have
dined
already
annunziata
followed
his
reasoning
thoughtfully
and
then
gravely
set
him
right
no
she
said
with
a
drop
of
the
eyelids
and
a
quick
little
shake
of
the
head
you
do
not
understand
i
will
explain
her
eyes
were
wide
open
again
and
bright
with
zeal
for
his
instruction
you
have
dined
already
that
is
a
certain
truth
because
this
meal
is
dinner
and
you
have
eaten
it
but
you
are
going
to
a
dinner
of
ceremony
and
that
is
different
a
dinner
of
ceremony
does
not
count
it
is
the
same
as
a
supper
my
uncle
himself
once
went
to
a
dinner
of
ceremony
at
bergamo
no
it
will
not
be
gluttony
for
you
to
go
to
a
dinner
of
ceremony
you
speak
like
a
little
pope
said
john
with
enthusiasm
in
matters
of
faith
and
morals
i
believe
you
are
infallible
if
you
could
guess
the
load
you
have
lifted
from
my
conscience
and
he
pushed
a
hearty
ouf
i
am
glad
said
annunziata
and
then
she
attempted
to
hark
back
curiosity
again
lighting
her
eyes
this
form
that
you
have
seen
in
the
garden
she
began
do
try
to
change
the
subject
john
interrupted
let
us
cultivate
sequence
in
our
ideas
what
i
am
labouring
with
hammer
and
tongs
to
drag
from
you
is
the
exact
date
at
which
somewhere
between
the
years
of
our
salvation
and
you
sat
for
your
portrait
to
the
beatified
painter
giovanni
of
fiesole
now
be
a
duck
and
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
annunziata
eyes
clouded
a
kind
of
scorn
a
kind
of
pity
and
a
kind
of
patient
longanimity
looked
from
them
that
is
folly
she
said
on
the
deepest
of
her
deep
notes
with
a
succession
of
slow
reflective
nods
folly
repeated
john
surprised
but
bland
oh
really
sit
for
my
portrait
between
the
years
and
how
could
i
scoffed
annunziata
why
what
was
to
prevent
you
innocently
questioned
he
come
i
was
not
yet
alive
said
she
john
looked
at
her
with
startled
eyes
and
spoke
with
animation
were
you
word
of
honour
are
you
sure
how
do
you
know
have
you
any
definite
recollection
that
you
were
can
you
clearly
recall
the
period
in
question
and
then
reviewing
it
in
detail
positively
attest
that
you
were
dead
for
there
no
third
choice
a
person
must
either
be
alive
or
dead
and
how
if
you
were
alive
how
ever
did
it
come
to
pass
that
there
should
be
a
perfect
portrait
of
you
from
brush
in
the
convent
of
saint
mark
at
florence
your
grave
little
white
face
and
your
wise
little
big
eyes
and
your
eager
little
inquisitive
profile
and
your
curls
flowing
about
your
shoulders
and
your
pinafore
that
so
like
a
peplum
there
they
all
are
precisely
as
i
see
them
before
me
now
and
how
was
giovanni
able
to
do
them
if
you
alive
perhaps
you
were
alive
in
heaven
giovanni
cell
as
is
well
known
had
a
window
that
opened
straight
into
heaven
perhaps
he
saw
you
through
that
window
and
painted
you
without
your
knowing
it
the
name
they
give
your
portrait
would
rather
seem
to
confirm
that
theory
what
do
you
think
they
call
it
they
call
it
an
i
got
a
copy
of
it
in
england
when
you
come
to
london
to
visit
the
queen
i
show
it
to
you
annunziata
gave
her
flowing
curls
a
toss
the
form
of
the
young
woman
which
you
have
seen
in
the
garden
she
began
anew
ah
said
john
observe
how
differently
the
big
fish
and
the
little
fish
will
be
affected
by
the
same
bait
when
you
first
spoke
of
it
said
she
i
thought
you
had
seen
a
holy
apparition
yes
said
he
that
was
because
i
couched
my
communication
in
language
designedly
misleading
i
employed
the
terminology
of
i
said
and
and
things
like
that
and
you
were
very
properly
and
naturally
deceived
i
confidently
expected
that
you
would
be
no
it
is
not
given
to
and
old
men
like
me
to
see
holy
apparitions
old
men
you
are
not
an
old
man
said
annunziata
oh
not
what
am
i
then
said
john
you
are
a
man
said
she
thank
you
golden
tongue
said
he
with
a
bow
and
you
are
sure
that
it
was
merely
a
real
person
she
pursued
no
said
he
i
am
too
profoundly
imbued
with
the
basic
principles
of
metaphysics
ever
to
be
sure
of
the
objective
reality
of
phenomena
i
can
only
swear
to
my
impression
my
impression
was
and
is
that
it
was
merely
a
real
person
then
said
annunziata
with
decision
it
must
be
the
person
who
is
visiting
the
signora
brandi
the
signora
brandi
repeated
john
what
a
nice
name
who
is
the
signora
brandi
she
is
an
austrian
said
annunziata
oh
said
john
she
lives
in
the
pavilion
beyond
the
said
annunziata
i
was
aware
said
john
that
the
pavilion
beyond
the
was
inhabited
i
was
aware
that
any
part
of
this
castle
was
inhabited
except
the
porter
lodge
and
the
part
that
we
inhabit
why
have
i
been
left
till
now
in
this
state
of
outer
darkness
the
signora
brandi
has
been
absent
said
annunziata
she
has
been
in
her
own
country
in
austria
but
the
other
day
she
returned
and
with
her
came
a
person
to
visit
her
that
is
the
person
whose
form
you
have
seen
in
the
garden
how
do
you
know
it
was
the
form
of
the
signora
brandi
herself
john
said
oh
no
said
annunziata
the
signora
brandi
is
not
young
she
is
old
she
is
as
old
as
methuselah
sin
the
hills
suggested
john
annunziata
having
paused
to
think
no
said
annunziata
repudiating
the
suggestion
with
force
no
one
is
so
old
as
methuselah
she
is
as
old
as
well
my
uncle
i
see
said
john
yes
it
all
highly
mysterious
mysterious
said
annunziata
i
should
think
so
asseverated
he
cryptic
enigmatic
esoteric
to
the
last
degree
to
begin
with
how
does
the
signora
brandi
being
an
austrian
come
by
so
characteristically
a
name
is
that
mysterious
and
in
the
next
place
why
does
an
austrian
signora
brandi
so
far
forget
what
is
due
to
her
nationality
as
to
live
not
in
austria
but
in
lombardy
and
as
if
that
were
not
enough
at
castel
alessina
and
as
if
that
were
not
more
than
enough
in
the
pavilion
beyond
the
clock
come
come
mysterious
you
are
living
in
lombardy
you
are
living
at
castel
sant
alessina
yourself
said
annunziata
i
hardly
think
so
said
john
you
can
scarcely
with
precision
call
this
living
this
is
rather
what
purists
call
sojourning
but
even
were
it
otherwise
there
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
my
case
and
the
signora
brandi
i
am
and
foolish
but
she
is
as
old
as
your
uncle
do
you
see
the
mysterious
significance
of
that
coincidence
and
i
have
a
young
woman
visiting
me
is
the
young
woman
is
that
a
mystery
my
sweet
child
we
tread
among
mysteries
we
are
at
the
centre
of
a
coil
of
mysteries
is
the
young
woman
and
how
consider
well
upon
this
how
does
it
happen
that
the
young
woman
speaks
english
mysterious
indeed
he
rose
and
bowed
with
ceremony
but
we
burn
daylight
i
must
not
detain
you
longer
suffer
me
to
imprint
upon
your
hand
of
velvet
a
token
of
my
high
regard
and
taking
annunziata
frail
little
white
hand
he
bent
low
to
kiss
it
and
though
his
blue
eyes
were
full
of
laughter
i
think
that
behind
the
laughter
there
was
a
great
deal
of
real
fondness
and
admiration
iv
down
the
long
straight
avenue
of
that
led
from
the
castle
to
the
principal
entrance
of
the
garden
annunziata
in
her
pinafore
that
was
so
like
a
peplum
with
her
hair
waving
about
her
shoulders
was
curled
up
in
the
corner
of
a
marble
bench
gazing
with
great
intentness
at
a
white
flower
that
lay
in
her
lap
it
was
the
warmest
and
the
peacefullest
moment
of
the
afternoon
the
sun
shone
steadily
not
a
leaf
stirred
not
a
shadow
wavered
and
the
intermittent
piping
of
a
blackbird
somewhere
in
the
green
world
overhead
seemed
merely
to
give
a
kind
of
joyous
rhythm
to
the
silence
mercy
upon
me
who
ever
saw
so
young
a
maiden
so
deeply
lost
in
thought
exclaimed
a
voice
annunziata
her
reverie
thus
disturbed
raised
a
pair
of
questioning
eyes
a
lady
was
standing
before
her
smiling
down
upon
her
a
lady
in
a
frock
of
muslin
with
a
white
sunshade
annunziata
who
when
she
liked
could
be
the
very
pink
of
formal
politeness
rose
dropped
a
courtesy
and
said
buon
giorno
signorina
buon
giorno
responded
the
smiling
lady
buon
giorno
and
a
penny
for
your
thoughts
but
i
sure
you
could
never
never
tell
what
it
was
you
were
thinking
so
hard
about
scusi
said
annunziata
i
was
trying
to
think
of
the
name
of
this
flower
she
stooped
and
picked
up
the
flower
which
had
slipped
from
her
lap
to
the
ground
when
she
rose
then
she
held
it
at
arm
length
for
inspection
oh
asked
the
lady
smiling
at
the
flower
as
she
had
smiled
at
its
possessor
is
it
a
narcissus
yes
said
annunziata
it
is
a
narcissus
but
i
was
trying
to
think
of
its
particular
name
the
lady
looked
as
if
she
did
not
quite
understand
its
particular
name
it
is
a
narcissus
explained
annunziata
just
as
i
am
a
girl
but
it
must
also
have
its
particular
name
just
as
i
have
mine
it
is
a
soul
doing
its
purgatory
a
very
good
soul
if
you
are
very
good
then
when
you
die
you
do
your
purgatory
as
a
flower
but
it
is
not
such
an
easy
purgatory
oh
no
for
look
the
flower
is
beautiful
but
it
is
blind
and
can
not
see
and
it
is
fragrant
but
it
can
not
smell
and
people
admire
it
and
praise
it
but
it
is
deaf
and
can
not
hear
it
can
only
wait
wait
wait
and
think
of
god
but
it
is
a
short
purgatory
a
few
days
and
the
flower
will
fade
and
the
soul
will
be
released
i
think
this
flower
name
is
cecilia
it
is
so
white
the
smile
in
the
lady
eyes
had
brightened
as
she
listened
and
now
she
gave
a
little
laugh
a
little
light
musical
pleased
and
friendly
laugh
yes
she
said
i
have
sometimes
wondered
myself
whether
flowers
might
not
be
the
purgatory
of
very
good
souls
i
am
glad
to
learn
from
you
that
it
is
true
and
yes
i
should
think
that
this
flower
name
was
sure
to
be
cecilia
cecilia
suits
it
perfectly
what
if
one
may
ask
is
particular
name
mariannunziata
said
its
bearer
not
to
make
two
bites
of
a
cherry
the
lady
eyes
grew
round
dear
me
a
little
short
name
like
that
she
marvelled
no
returned
annunziata
with
dignity
my
name
in
full
is
longer
my
name
in
full
is
giuliana
falconieri
maria
annunziata
casalone
is
that
not
long
enough
yes
the
lady
admitted
that
is
just
long
enough
and
she
laughed
again
what
is
name
inquired
annunziata
my
name
is
maria
dolores
the
lady
answered
you
see
we
are
both
named
maria
of
course
said
annunziata
all
christians
should
be
named
maria
so
they
should
agreed
the
lady
do
you
ever
tell
people
how
old
you
are
yes
said
annunziata
if
they
wish
to
know
why
not
the
smile
in
the
lady
eyes
shone
brighter
than
ever
do
you
think
you
could
be
persuaded
to
tell
me
with
pleasure
said
annunziata
i
am
eleven
years
and
five
months
and
you
i
am
just
twice
as
old
i
am
years
and
ten
months
so
when
you
are
fifty
how
old
shall
i
be
no
said
annunziata
shaking
her
head
that
trick
has
been
tried
with
me
before
my
friend
prospero
has
tried
it
with
me
you
hope
i
will
say
that
you
will
be
a
hundred
but
it
is
not
so
when
i
am
fifty
you
will
be
going
on
still
again
the
lady
laughed
apparently
with
great
amusement
what
a
little
bundle
of
wisdom
you
are
she
exclaimed
yes
my
friend
prospero
also
says
that
i
am
wise
answered
annunziata
i
like
to
see
you
laugh
she
mentioned
looking
critically
at
the
face
above
her
you
have
beautiful
teeth
they
are
so
white
and
shining
and
so
small
and
your
lips
are
so
red
oh
said
the
lady
laughing
more
merrily
than
ever
then
you
must
be
very
entertaining
and
i
will
laugh
a
great
deal
still
looking
critically
at
the
lady
face
are
you
not
demanded
annunziata
the
person
who
has
come
to
visit
the
signora
brandi
signora
brandi
the
lady
considered
yes
i
suppose
i
must
be
at
any
rate
i
am
the
person
who
has
come
to
visit
frau
brandt
frao
branta
we
call
her
signora
brandi
here
said
annunziata
are
you
related
to
her
no
said
the
lady
who
always
seemed
inclined
to
laugh
though
annunziata
had
no
consciousness
of
being
very
entertaining
i
am
not
related
to
her
i
am
only
her
friend
she
is
an
austrian
said
annunziata
this
castle
belongs
to
austrians
once
upon
a
time
very
long
ago
before
i
was
born
all
this
country
belonged
to
austrians
are
you
too
an
austrian
yes
the
lady
nodded
i
too
am
an
austrian
and
yet
remarked
annunziata
you
speak
italian
just
as
i
do
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
say
so
laughed
the
lady
no
it
is
the
truth
said
annunziata
but
is
it
not
good
to
tell
the
truth
the
lady
asked
no
said
annunziata
it
is
only
a
duty
and
again
she
shook
her
head
slowly
darkly
with
an
effect
of
philosophic
melancholy
that
is
very
strange
and
very
hard
she
pointed
out
if
you
do
not
do
that
which
is
your
duty
it
is
bad
and
you
are
punished
but
if
you
do
do
it
that
is
not
good
it
is
only
what
you
ought
to
do
and
you
are
not
rewarded
and
she
fetched
her
breath
in
the
saddest
of
sad
little
sighs
then
briskly
covering
her
cheerfulness
and
you
speak
english
besides
she
said
oh
wondered
the
lady
are
you
a
clairvoyante
how
do
you
know
that
i
speak
english
my
friend
prospero
told
me
so
said
annunziata
your
friend
prospero
the
lady
repeated
you
quote
your
friend
prospero
very
often
who
is
your
friend
prospero
he
is
a
signore
said
annunziata
he
has
seen
you
he
has
seen
your
form
in
the
garden
and
in
the
olive
wood
oh
said
the
lady
and
i
suppose
he
must
have
heard
you
speak
english
annunziata
added
he
lives
at
the
presbytery
and
where
do
live
asked
the
lady
i
live
at
the
presbytery
too
said
annunziata
i
am
the
niece
of
the
parroco
i
am
the
orphan
of
his
only
brother
my
friend
prospero
lives
with
us
as
a
boarder
he
is
english
indeed
said
the
lady
prospero
is
a
very
odd
name
for
an
englishman
prospero
is
not
his
name
said
annunziata
his
name
is
gian
that
is
english
for
giovanni
but
why
then
the
lady
puzzled
do
you
call
him
prospero
prospero
is
a
name
i
have
given
him
explained
annunziata
one
day
i
told
his
fortune
i
can
tell
fortunes
with
with
or
from
the
lines
of
the
hand
i
will
tell
you
yours
if
you
wish
well
one
day
i
told
prospero
and
everything
came
out
so
prosperously
for
him
i
have
called
him
prospero
ever
since
he
will
be
rich
though
he
is
poor
and
he
will
marry
a
dark
woman
who
will
also
be
rich
and
they
will
have
many
many
children
and
live
in
peace
to
the
end
of
their
lives
but
there
annunziata
cried
out
suddenly
with
excitement
waving
the
hand
that
held
her
narcissus
there
is
my
friend
prospero
now
coming
in
the
gig
down
the
avenue
sure
enough
a
gig
was
coming
a
sufficiently
shabby
ancient
gig
drawn
however
at
a
very
decent
pace
by
a
very
horse
and
driven
by
john
blanchemain
prospero
called
annunziata
as
he
passed
and
john
took
off
his
hat
a
modish
panama
and
bowed
and
smiled
to
her
and
to
the
lady
and
one
adept
in
reading
the
meaning
of
smiles
might
have
read
three
or
four
separate
meanings
in
that
smile
of
his
it
seemed
to
say
to
annunziata
ah
you
rogue
so
already
you
have
waylaid
her
and
made
her
acquaintance
to
the
lady
i
congratulate
you
upon
your
companion
is
she
a
diverting
little
monkey
to
himself
and
i
congratulate
my
dear
upon
being
clothed
and
in
your
right
mind
and
upon
having
a
proper
hat
to
make
your
bow
with
and
to
the
universe
at
large
by
jove
she
standing
there
before
that
marble
bench
in
the
cool
green
light
under
the
great
ilexes
with
her
lilac
frock
and
her
white
sunshade
and
annunziata
all
in
grey
beside
her
what
a
subject
for
a
painting
if
only
there
were
any
painters
who
knew
how
to
paint
he
is
going
to
a
dinner
at
roccadoro
said
annunziata
while
back
grew
small
and
smaller
in
the
distance
did
you
see
he
had
a
portmanteau
under
the
seat
he
is
going
to
a
dinner
of
ceremony
and
he
will
have
his
costume
of
ceremony
in
the
portmaneau
i
wonder
what
he
will
bring
back
with
him
for
me
when
he
goes
to
roccadoro
he
always
brings
something
back
for
me
last
time
it
was
a
box
of
chocolate
cigars
i
should
like
to
see
him
in
his
costume
of
ceremony
you
but
the
lady
merely
laughed
and
then
taking
annunziata
chin
in
her
hand
she
looked
down
into
her
big
clear
eyes
and
said
i
must
be
off
now
to
join
signora
brandi
but
i
can
not
leave
without
telling
you
how
glad
i
am
to
have
met
you
and
what
pleasure
i
have
derived
from
your
conversation
i
hope
we
shall
meet
often
signorina
said
annunziata
becoming
formally
polite
again
i
shall
always
be
at
your
service
and
she
dropped
another
courtesy
if
you
will
come
to
see
me
at
the
presbytery
she
hospitably
added
i
will
show
you
my
tame
kid
you
are
all
that
is
most
kind
responded
the
lady
and
went
off
smiling
towards
the
castle
annunziata
curled
herself
up
in
her
old
corner
of
the
marble
bench
and
appeared
to
relapse
into
profound
thought
v
a
curious
little
intimate
inward
glow
a
sense
somewhere
deep
down
in
his
consciousness
of
elation
and
accompanied
john
all
the
way
to
roccadoro
mingling
with
and
sweetening
whatever
thoughts
or
perceptions
occupied
his
immediate
attention
this
was
a
that
he
knew
of
old
and
he
had
no
difficulty
in
referring
it
to
its
cause
it
was
the
glow
and
the
elation
which
he
was
fortunate
enough
always
to
experience
when
his
eye
had
been
fed
with
a
fresh
impression
of
beauty
and
he
knew
that
he
owed
it
to
the
glimpse
he
had
had
in
the
cool
light
under
the
ilexes
of
a
slender
figure
in
lilac
and
a
tiny
figure
in
grey
beside
a
old
marble
bench
in
the
midst
of
a
shadowy
sunny
brown
and
green
italian
garden
the
drive
to
roccadoro
from
sant
alessina
is
a
pleasant
drive
the
road
follows
for
the
most
part
the
windings
of
the
rampio
so
that
you
are
seldom
out
of
sight
of
its
gleaming
waters
and
the
brawl
of
it
now
louder
now
less
loud
is
perpetually
in
your
ears
to
right
and
left
you
have
the
tender
pink
of
blossoming
almonds
with
sometimes
the
scarlet
flame
of
a
pomegranate
and
then
the
hills
mantled
in
a
kind
of
transparent
a
gauze
of
gold
woven
of
haze
and
sunshine
and
then
rosy
white
with
pale
violet
shadows
the
cut
like
cameos
upon
the
brilliant
azure
of
the
sky
and
sometimes
of
course
you
rattle
through
a
village
with
its
crumbling
stained
and
faded
houses
its
dazzling
white
canvas
awnings
its
church
and
campanile
and
its
life
that
seems
to
pass
entirely
in
the
street
men
in
their
shirt
sleeves
lounging
smoking
spitting
else
the
land
were
not
italy
or
perhaps
playing
cards
at
a
table
under
the
leafless
bush
of
the
women
gossiping
over
their
needlework
or
gathered
in
sociable
knots
combing
and
binding
up
their
sleek
black
hair
children
sprawling
in
the
kindly
dirt
the
priest
biretta
on
head
nose
in
breviary
drifting
slowly
upon
some
priestly
errand
and
getting
through
his
office
and
the
immemorial
goatherd
in
a
tattered
hat
followed
by
his
flock
with
their
queer
anxious
faces
blowing
upon
his
shrill
strains
in
minor
mode
and
plagal
scale
a
music
older
than
theocritus
or
stopping
jealously
watched
by
the
customer
avid
italian
eyes
to
milk
due
say
a
worth
into
an
outstretched
jug
sometimes
the
almond
orchards
give
place
to
vineyards
or
to
maize
fields
or
to
dusky
groves
of
walnut
or
to
plantations
of
scrubby
oak
where
lean
black
pigs
forage
for
the
delectable
acorn
sometimes
the
valley
narrows
to
a
ravine
and
signs
of
cultivation
disappear
and
the
voice
of
the
rampio
swells
to
a
roar
and
you
become
aware
between
the
hills
that
rise
gloomy
and
almost
sheer
beside
you
of
a
great
solitude
a
solitude
that
is
intensified
rather
than
diminished
by
the
sight
of
some
lonely
infinitely
lonely
grange
perched
far
aloft
at
a
height
that
seems
out
of
reach
of
the
world
what
possible
manner
of
human
beings
you
wonder
can
inhabit
there
and
what
possible
dreary
manner
of
existence
can
they
lead
but
even
in
the
most
solitary
places
you
are
welcomed
and
sped
on
by
a
chorus
of
the
hillsides
resound
with
continuously
for
the
whole
seven
miles
and
continuously
at
this
season
for
the
whole
hours
blackbirds
thrushes
blackcaps
goldfinches
chaffinches
sing
from
the
first
peep
of
dawn
till
the
last
trace
of
daylight
has
died
out
and
then
the
nightingales
begin
and
keep
it
up
till
dawn
again
and
everywhere
the
soft
air
is
aromatic
with
a
faint
scent
of
rosemary
for
rosemary
grows
everywhere
under
the
trees
and
everywhere
you
have
the
purity
and
brilliancy
and
yet
restraint
of
colour
and
the
crisp
economy
of
line
which
give
the
italian
landscape
its
look
of
having
been
designed
by
a
conscious
artist
in
and
through
his
enjoyment
of
all
these
pleasantnesses
john
felt
that
agreeable
glow
which
he
owed
to
his
glimpse
of
the
woman
in
the
garden
and
when
at
last
he
reached
the
hotel
victoria
and
having
dressed
found
himself
alone
for
a
few
moments
with
lady
blanchemain
in
the
dim
and
cool
where
she
awaited
her
guests
he
hastened
to
let
her
know
that
he
shared
her
own
opinion
of
the
woman
charms
your
beauty
decidedly
a
beauty
he
declared
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
her
as
i
saw
her
an
hour
ago
with
a
white
sunshade
against
a
background
of
ilexes
it
a
thousand
pities
that
painting
should
be
a
forgotten
art
but
lady
blanchemain
magnificent
in
purple
velvet
with
diamonds
round
her
throat
and
in
her
hair
did
seem
interested
do
you
know
she
said
i
made
yesterday
one
of
the
most
ridiculous
blunders
of
my
life
it
been
preying
upon
my
mind
ever
since
i
generally
have
pretty
trustworthy
perceptions
and
perhaps
this
is
a
symptom
of
failing
powers
i
told
myself
positively
that
you
were
an
eton
and
balliol
man
it
never
occurred
to
me
till
i
was
halfway
home
that
as
a
papist
you
be
nothing
of
the
sort
no
said
john
i
afraid
i
edgbaston
and
paris
the
way
her
hair
grows
low
about
her
brow
and
swoops
upwards
and
backwards
in
a
sort
of
tidal
wave
and
breaks
loose
in
little
curling
tendrils
absolutely
lyrical
and
the
smile
at
the
bottom
of
her
eyes
is
exactly
like
silent
music
and
her
mouth
is
a
couplet
in
praise
of
love
with
two
red
lips
for
rhymes
and
her
chin
is
a
perfect
epithalamium
of
a
chin
and
then
her
figure
and
then
her
lilac
frock
oh
it
a
thousand
thousand
pities
that
painting
should
he
a
forgotten
art
what
the
same
lilac
frock
said
lady
blanchemain
absently
yet
you
certainly
have
the
eton
voice
she
mused
and
if
i
do
pay
you
the
doubtful
compliment
of
saying
that
you
have
the
balliol
manner
you
have
at
least
a
kind
of
subtilized
reminiscence
of
it
i
must
keep
a
guard
upon
myself
said
john
she
visiting
an
austrian
woman
who
lives
in
a
remote
wing
of
the
castle
the
pavilion
beyond
the
clock
in
fact
an
austrian
woman
of
the
exhilarating
name
of
brandi
i
rather
in
luck
for
my
dinner
said
lady
blanchemain
i
got
agnes
scope
the
niece
of
the
duke
of
wexmouth
she
arrived
here
this
morning
with
her
aunt
lady
louisa
of
course
i
putting
you
next
to
her
as
besides
being
an
extremely
nice
girl
and
an
heiress
she
an
ardent
pervert
to
romanism
well
a
word
to
the
wise
yes
i
know
her
said
john
we
do
get
on
a
bit
she
moves
on
far
too
high
a
plane
for
a
groundling
like
me
she
intellectual
and
earnest
and
my
ignorance
and
wound
her
to
the
quick
she
end
as
i
told
her
to
her
face
by
writing
books
serious
novels
probably
which
she
illuminate
with
beautiful
irrelevant
quotations
from
browning
and
cardinal
newman
bother
said
lady
blanchemain
you
perverse
besides
said
john
she
engaged
engaged
faltered
lady
blanchemain
yes
to
an
intellectual
and
earnest
man
named
blake
bernard
blake
a
grandson
of
the
famous
blake
of
cambridge
lady
blanchemain
fixed
him
with
darkening
eyes
are
you
sure
she
pleaded
i
saw
it
officially
stated
in
the
was
relentless
answer
what
a
nuisance
said
lady
blanchemain
fanning
her
fan
was
of
amber
with
white
ostrich
feathers
and
the
end
sticks
bore
her
cypher
and
coronet
in
gold
what
a
jolly
fan
said
john
well
well
said
lady
blanchemain
reconciling
herself
then
after
an
instant
of
pensiveness
so
you
already
laid
low
by
her
beauty
but
you
have
found
out
yet
who
she
is
who
who
is
said
john
looking
all
at
sea
tut
do
tease
your
woman
at
the
castle
my
woman
at
the
castle
appeared
to
leave
you
cold
he
complained
i
arrived
full
of
her
and
you
would
listen
so
you
already
in
love
with
her
said
lady
blanchemain
no
not
yet
said
he
as
yet
i
merely
recognize
in
her
admirable
material
for
a
painting
and
regret
that
such
material
should
go
begging
for
the
lack
of
a
painter
but
by
this
time
who
can
tell
have
you
found
out
who
she
is
asked
lady
blanchemain
no
not
yet
said
he
as
yet
i
merely
found
out
that
visiting
an
austrian
signora
brandi
who
lives
i
ca
think
why
in
the
pavilion
beyond
the
clock
but
by
this
time
his
gesture
spoke
volumes
of
prospective
information
she
looked
like
a
gentlewoman
reflected
his
friend
for
all
the
world
said
he
yet
if
she
an
austrian
she
paused
and
pondered
why
what
the
difficulty
said
he
to
know
whether
she
is
said
lady
blanchemain
among
austrians
unless
you
born
you
impossible
you
nowhere
brandi
does
sound
born
does
it
we
must
let
you
become
enamoured
of
her
if
she
is
born
brandi
sounds
tremendously
assented
john
and
if
like
visits
like
signora
brandi
visitor
will
probably
be
unborn
too
but
to
me
that
would
rather
add
an
attraction
provided
she
not
an
austrian
i
a
briton
and
a
democrat
i
feel
it
is
my
destiny
if
ever
i
am
to
become
enamoured
at
all
to
become
enamoured
of
the
daughter
of
a
miller
of
a
rising
miller
who
has
given
his
daughter
advantages
not
born
or
the
lady
of
the
mill
that
shall
be
the
title
of
my
humble
if
this
woman
could
prove
to
me
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
miller
i
not
sure
i
should
become
enamoured
of
her
on
the
spot
well
i
shall
know
by
this
time
i
shall
possess
her
entire
it
may
interest
you
to
learn
that
i
am
employing
a
detective
to
investigate
her
a
detective
what
do
you
mean
said
lady
blanchemain
a
private
detective
a
female
detective
whom
the
next
time
you
come
to
sant
alessina
i
introduce
to
you
said
john
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
said
lady
blanchemain
the
most
amusing
the
most
adorable
little
detective
unhung
said
he
people
are
all
love
and
laughter
whenever
they
look
at
her
she
worm
its
inmost
secrets
from
my
sphinx
heart
what
pleasure
can
you
take
in
practising
upon
a
poor
old
woman
who
only
by
a
sort
of
fluke
is
your
grandmother
said
she
lady
louisa
fitzstephen
miss
scope
said
her
servant
opening
the
door
vi
the
nightingales
sang
him
home
and
the
moon
lighted
him
the
liquid
moon
of
april
and
italy
as
he
approached
the
castle
through
the
purple
and
silver
garden
amid
the
mysterious
sweet
odours
of
the
night
he
glanced
up
vaguely
at
the
pavilion
beyond
the
clock
he
glanced
up
vaguely
but
next
second
he
was
no
longer
vague
there
on
a
balcony
not
ten
feet
above
him
full
in
the
moonlight
stood
a
figure
in
white
all
in
white
with
a
scarf
of
white
lace
thrown
over
her
dark
hair
the
nightingales
sang
and
sobbed
the
moon
rained
its
amethystine
fire
upon
the
earth
the
earth
gave
forth
its
mysterious
sweet
night
odours
and
she
stood
there
motionless
and
breathed
and
gazed
and
listened
but
at
the
sound
of
wheels
in
the
avenue
she
turned
slightly
and
looked
down
her
face
was
fair
and
delicate
and
pure
in
the
moonlight
and
her
eyes
shone
darkly
bright
she
turned
and
looked
down
and
her
eyes
met
john
given
the
hour
and
the
place
i
wonder
whether
i
ought
to
bow
he
thought
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
however
his
hand
had
automatically
raised
his
hat
she
inclined
her
head
in
acknowledgment
and
something
softly
changed
in
her
face
she
smiled
he
said
and
caught
his
breath
with
a
kind
of
astonished
exultancy
that
soft
change
in
her
face
came
and
went
and
came
again
through
all
his
dreams
part
third
i
good
morning
prospero
said
annunziata
good
morning
responded
john
he
was
in
the
octagonal
room
on
the
of
the
castle
where
his
lost
ladies
of
old
years
smiled
on
him
from
their
frames
he
had
heard
an
approaching
patter
of
feet
on
the
pavement
of
the
room
beyond
and
then
annunziata
little
grey
figure
white
face
and
big
grave
eyes
had
appeared
one
picture
the
more
in
the
vast
carved
and
gilded
doorway
i
have
been
looking
everywhere
for
you
she
said
plaintive
poor
sweetheart
he
commiserated
her
and
ca
you
find
me
i
could
said
annunziata
bearing
on
the
tense
but
i
have
found
you
oh
have
you
where
asked
he
cried
she
with
a
disdainful
movement
but
of
course
i
would
be
too
cocksure
of
that
he
cautioned
her
is
a
mighty
evasive
bird
for
suppose
we
were
elsewhere
then
would
be
here
and
here
would
be
somewhere
else
no
said
annunziata
with
resolution
where
a
person
is
that
is
always
you
speak
as
if
a
person
carried
his
here
with
him
like
his
hat
said
john
yes
that
is
how
it
is
said
annunziata
nodding
you
have
a
remarkably
solid
little
head
for
all
its
curls
there
no
confusing
it
said
he
well
have
you
your
report
drawn
up
signed
sealed
sworn
to
before
a
commissioner
for
oaths
and
ready
to
be
delivered
my
report
questioned
annunziata
with
a
glance
about
the
form
said
john
i
caught
you
yesterday
in
the
fact
of
pumping
it
yes
said
annunziata
her
name
is
maria
dolores
a
most
becoming
name
said
he
she
is
very
nice
said
annunziata
she
looks
very
nice
said
he
she
is
years
and
ten
months
old
continued
his
informant
fancy
as
as
that
commented
he
yes
she
is
an
austrian
ah
and
as
i
told
you
she
is
visiting
the
signora
brandi
only
she
calls
her
frao
branta
frao
branta
john
turned
the
name
on
his
tongue
branta
branta
what
familiar
german
name
at
the
back
of
his
memory
did
it
half
evoke
suddenly
he
had
a
flash
can
you
possibly
mean
frau
brandt
annunziata
gave
a
gesture
of
affirmation
yes
that
is
it
she
said
you
sound
it
just
as
she
did
i
see
said
john
and
brandt
if
there
are
degrees
of
unbirth
is
even
more
furiously
unborn
than
brandi
unborn
said
annunziata
frowning
not
noble
not
of
the
aristocracy
john
explained
very
few
people
are
noble
said
annunziata
all
the
more
reason
then
why
you
and
i
should
be
thankful
that
we
are
said
he
you
and
i
she
expostulated
with
a
shrug
of
her
little
grey
shoulders
we
are
not
noble
are
we
how
do
you
know
asked
john
anyhow
he
impressively
moralized
we
can
try
to
be
no
said
she
with
conclusiveness
with
fatalism
it
is
no
good
trying
either
you
are
noble
or
simple
god
makes
you
so
you
can
not
help
it
if
i
were
noble
i
should
be
a
contessina
if
you
were
noble
you
would
be
a
gransignore
and
my
unassuming
appearance
assures
you
that
i
not
said
he
smiling
if
you
were
a
gransignore
she
instructed
him
you
would
never
be
such
friends
with
me
you
would
be
too
proud
john
laughed
you
judge
people
by
the
company
they
keep
well
i
will
apply
the
same
principle
of
judgment
to
your
gossip
maria
dolores
he
broke
off
to
inquire
what
is
her
pagan
name
her
pagan
name
what
is
that
asked
annunziata
maria
dolores
i
take
it
is
her
christian
name
come
by
in
holy
baptism
said
john
but
i
suppose
she
will
have
a
pagan
name
come
by
in
the
way
of
the
flesh
to
round
it
off
with
just
as
for
instance
a
certain
flame
of
mine
whose
image
when
i
die
they
find
engraved
upon
my
heart
has
the
pagan
name
of
casalone
annunziata
looked
up
surprised
casalone
that
is
my
name
she
said
yes
said
john
yours
will
be
the
image
annunziata
gave
her
head
a
toss
maria
dolores
did
not
tell
me
her
pagan
name
she
said
at
any
rate
said
he
to
judge
by
the
company
she
keeps
we
may
safely
classify
her
as
unborn
she
is
probably
the
daughter
of
a
miller
of
a
miller
to
judge
also
a
little
by
the
frocks
she
wears
in
rather
a
large
way
of
business
who
to
judge
finally
by
her
cultivated
voice
her
knowledge
of
languages
and
her
generally
distinguished
air
has
spared
no
expense
in
the
matter
of
her
education
i
wonder
a
bit
if
she
could
even
play
the
piano
no
agreed
annunziata
that
is
very
likely
but
why
she
tilted
upwards
her
inquisitive
little
profile
why
should
you
think
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
miller
miller
said
john
i
use
as
a
generic
term
her
father
may
be
a
lexicographer
or
a
a
designer
of
dirigible
balloons
or
a
manufacturer
of
he
may
even
be
a
person
of
independent
means
who
lives
in
a
big
new
stuccoed
villa
in
the
suburbs
of
vienna
and
devotes
his
leisure
to
the
propagation
of
orchids
yet
all
the
while
a
miller
by
miller
i
mean
a
member
of
the
bourgeoisie
a
man
who
though
he
be
well
to
do
well
educated
well
bred
does
not
bear
and
is
therefore
to
be
regarded
by
those
who
do
with
their
noses
in
the
air
especially
in
austria
among
austrians
unless
you
bear
you
impossible
you
nowhere
we
must
let
you
become
enamoured
of
her
if
she
does
bear
annunziata
eyes
during
this
divagation
had
wandered
to
the
window
the
tall
window
with
its
view
of
the
terraced
garden
where
the
mimosa
bloomed
and
the
blackcaps
carolled
now
she
turned
them
slowly
upon
john
and
he
saw
from
their
expression
that
at
last
she
was
coming
to
what
for
her
as
he
had
known
all
along
was
the
real
preoccupation
of
the
moment
they
were
immensely
serious
intensely
concerned
and
at
the
same
time
in
their
farther
recesses
you
felt
a
kind
of
fluttering
shyness
as
if
dare
were
hanging
upon
tell
me
she
began
on
a
deep
note
a
deep
coaxing
note
then
dare
got
the
better
and
she
held
back
then
took
his
courage
in
both
hands
and
she
plunged
what
have
you
brought
for
me
from
roccadoro
and
after
one
glance
of
supplication
she
let
her
eyes
drop
and
stood
before
him
suspensive
as
one
awaiting
the
word
of
destiny
john
radiant
blondeur
his
yellow
beard
pink
face
and
eyes
lighted
up
more
radiant
still
with
subcutaneous
laughter
the
shops
were
shut
he
said
i
arrived
after
closing
time
but
something
in
his
tone
rendered
this
grim
announcement
nugatory
annunziata
drew
a
long
breath
and
looked
up
again
you
have
brought
me
something
all
the
same
she
declared
with
conviction
and
eagerly
eyes
gleaming
what
is
it
what
is
it
she
besought
him
john
laughed
you
are
quite
right
he
said
if
one
ca
buy
beg
or
borrow
in
this
world
one
can
generally
steal
annunziata
drew
away
regarded
him
with
misgiving
oh
no
you
would
never
steal
she
protested
i
not
so
sure
for
one
i
loved
said
he
what
would
you
have
liked
me
to
bring
you
annunziata
thought
i
liked
those
chocolate
cigars
she
said
her
face
soft
with
reminiscence
of
delight
ah
but
we
must
have
it
said
john
do
you
by
any
chance
like
marchpane
marchpane
i
adore
it
she
answered
in
an
outburst
of
emotion
you
have
your
human
weaknesses
after
all
john
laughed
well
i
stole
a
pocketful
of
marchpane
annunziata
drew
away
again
her
little
white
forehead
furrowed
stole
she
repeated
reluctant
to
believe
yes
said
he
brazenly
nodding
his
head
oh
that
was
very
wrong
said
annunziata
sadly
shaking
hers
no
said
he
because
in
the
first
place
it
a
matter
of
proverbial
wisdom
that
stolen
marchpane
sweetest
and
in
the
next
place
i
stole
it
quite
openly
under
the
eye
of
the
person
it
belonged
to
and
she
made
no
effort
to
defend
her
property
seeing
which
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
explain
to
her
i
was
stealing
it
a
young
limb
mischief
with
a
sweet
tooth
at
sant
alessina
i
explained
regularly
levies
blackmail
upon
me
i
stealing
this
for
her
and
then
the
lady
i
was
stealing
from
told
me
i
might
steal
as
much
as
ever
i
thought
good
said
annunziata
a
of
relief
then
you
steal
it
she
it
to
you
well
said
john
if
casuistry
like
that
can
ease
your
conscience
if
you
feel
that
you
can
conscientiously
receive
it
and
he
allowed
his
inflection
to
complete
the
sentence
give
it
to
me
said
annunziata
holding
out
her
hands
and
dancing
up
and
down
in
glee
and
in
impatience
said
john
not
till
after
dinner
i
not
going
to
be
a
party
to
the
spoiling
of
a
fair
young
healthy
appetite
pain
wrote
itself
upon
annunziata
brow
oh
she
grieved
must
i
wait
till
after
dinner
yes
said
john
for
a
she
struggled
would
it
be
bad
of
me
she
asked
if
i
begged
for
just
a
now
yes
said
john
bad
and
bootless
you
find
me
as
unyielding
as
adamant
ah
well
sighed
annunziata
a
deep
and
tremulous
sigh
then
i
will
wait
and
like
a
true
philosopher
she
proceeded
to
occupy
her
mind
with
a
fresh
interest
she
looked
round
the
room
she
looked
out
of
the
window
why
do
you
stay
here
it
is
much
pleasanter
in
the
garden
she
remarked
i
came
here
to
seek
for
consolation
began
for
me
with
a
tragic
misadventure
john
replied
annunziata
eyes
grew
big
compassionating
him
and
at
the
same
time
bespeaking
a
lively
curiosity
poor
prospero
she
gently
murmured
what
was
it
on
she
demanded
well
he
said
when
i
rose
to
go
for
my
morning
swim
i
made
an
elaborate
toilet
because
i
hoped
to
meet
a
certain
person
whom
for
reasons
connected
with
my
dignity
i
wished
to
impress
but
it
was
love
labour
lost
the
certain
person
is
an
ornament
of
the
uncertain
sex
and
did
turn
up
so
to
console
myself
i
came
here
annunziata
looked
round
the
room
again
what
is
there
here
that
can
console
you
these
said
john
his
hand
swept
the
pictured
walls
the
paintings
said
she
following
his
gesture
how
can
they
console
you
they
so
well
painted
said
he
fondly
studying
the
canvases
besides
these
ladies
are
dead
i
like
dead
ladies
annunziata
looked
critically
at
the
pictures
and
then
at
him
with
solemn
meaning
they
are
very
pretty
but
they
are
not
dead
she
pronounced
in
her
deepest
voice
not
dead
echoed
john
astonished
are
they
no
said
she
with
a
slow
shake
of
the
head
dear
me
said
he
and
when
they
alone
here
and
no
one
looking
do
you
think
they
come
down
from
their
frames
and
dance
it
must
be
a
sight
worth
seeing
no
said
annunziata
these
are
only
their
pictures
they
can
not
come
down
from
their
frames
but
the
ladies
themselves
are
not
dead
some
of
them
are
still
in
purgatory
perhaps
we
should
pray
for
them
she
made
in
parenthesis
as
it
were
a
pious
sign
of
the
cross
some
are
perhaps
already
in
heaven
we
should
ask
their
prayers
and
others
are
perhaps
in
hell
she
pursued
inexorable
theologian
that
she
was
but
none
of
them
is
dead
no
one
is
dead
there
no
such
thing
as
being
dead
but
then
puzzled
john
what
is
it
that
people
mean
when
they
talk
of
death
i
will
tell
you
said
annunziata
her
eyes
heavy
with
thought
listen
and
i
will
tell
you
she
seated
herself
on
the
big
round
ottoman
and
raised
her
face
to
his
have
you
ever
been
at
a
pantomime
she
asked
yes
said
john
wondering
what
could
possibly
be
coming
have
you
been
at
the
pantomime
she
continued
earnestly
when
there
was
what
they
call
a
yes
said
john
well
said
she
last
winter
i
was
taken
to
the
pantomime
at
bergamo
and
i
saw
a
you
ask
me
what
is
death
it
is
exactly
like
a
at
the
pantomime
the
scene
was
just
like
the
world
there
were
trees
and
houses
and
people
common
people
like
any
one
then
suddenly
click
oh
it
was
wonderful
everything
was
changed
the
trees
had
leaves
of
gold
and
silver
and
the
houses
were
like
fairy
palaces
and
there
were
strange
lights
red
and
blue
and
there
were
great
garlands
of
the
most
beautiful
flowers
and
the
people
were
like
angels
with
gems
and
shining
clothes
well
you
understand
at
first
we
had
only
seen
one
side
of
the
scene
then
click
everything
was
turned
round
and
we
saw
the
other
side
that
is
like
life
and
death
always
while
we
are
alive
we
can
see
only
one
side
of
things
but
there
is
the
other
side
the
under
side
never
so
long
as
we
are
alive
we
can
never
never
see
it
but
when
we
die
click
it
is
a
everything
is
turned
round
and
we
see
the
other
side
oh
it
will
be
very
different
it
will
be
wonderful
that
is
what
they
call
death
it
was
john
turn
to
be
grave
it
was
some
time
before
he
spoke
he
looked
down
at
her
with
a
kind
of
grave
laughter
in
his
eyes
admiring
considering
what
could
he
say
what
he
did
say
at
last
was
simply
thank
you
my
dear
annunziata
jumped
up
oh
come
she
urged
let
go
into
the
garden
it
is
so
much
nicer
there
than
here
there
are
lots
of
cockchafers
besides
she
held
out
as
an
additional
inducement
we
might
meet
maria
dolores
no
said
john
though
the
cockchafers
are
a
temptation
i
will
stop
here
but
go
you
to
the
garden
by
all
means
and
if
you
do
meet
maria
dolores
tell
her
what
you
have
just
told
me
i
think
she
would
like
to
hear
it
all
right
consented
annunziata
moving
towards
the
door
i
see
you
at
dinner
you
wo
forget
the
marchpane
ii
john
was
in
a
state
of
mind
that
perplexed
and
rather
annoyed
him
until
the
day
before
yesterday
his
detachment
here
at
sant
alessina
from
ordinary
human
society
the
absence
of
people
more
or
less
of
his
own
sort
had
been
one
of
the
elements
of
his
situation
which
he
had
positively
consciously
rejoiced
in
had
been
an
appreciable
part
of
what
he
had
summarized
to
lady
blanchemain
as
the
whole
blessed
thing
he
had
his
castle
his
pictures
his
garden
he
had
the
hills
and
valley
the
birds
the
flowers
the
clouds
the
sun
he
had
the
rampio
he
had
annunziata
he
even
had
annunziata
uncle
and
with
all
this
he
had
a
sense
of
having
stepped
out
of
a
world
that
he
knew
by
heart
that
he
knew
to
satiety
a
world
that
was
stale
and
stuffy
and
threadbare
with
its
gilt
rubbed
off
and
its
colours
tarnished
into
a
world
where
everything
was
fresh
and
undiscovered
and
full
of
savour
a
great
cool
blue
and
green
world
that
from
minute
to
minute
opened
up
new
perspectives
made
new
promises
brought
to
pass
new
surprises
and
this
sense
in
some
strange
way
included
time
as
well
as
space
it
was
as
if
he
had
entered
a
new
region
of
time
as
if
he
had
escaped
from
the
moving
current
of
time
into
a
stationary
moment
alone
here
where
modern
things
or
thoughts
had
never
penetrated
alone
with
the
earth
and
the
sky
the
medi√¶val
castle
the
dead
ladies
with
annunziata
and
the
parroco
and
the
parroco
masses
and
benedictions
he
would
please
himself
by
fancying
might
be
a
yesterday
of
long
ago
that
had
somehow
dropped
out
of
the
calendar
and
remained
a
fragment
of
the
past
that
had
been
forgotten
and
left
over
the
presence
of
a
person
of
his
own
sort
a
fellow
citizen
of
his
own
period
wearing
its
clothes
speaking
its
speech
would
have
broken
the
charm
would
have
seemed
as
undesirable
and
as
inappropriate
as
the
introduction
of
an
english
meadow
into
the
italian
landscape
yet
now
such
a
person
had
come
and
behold
her
presence
so
far
from
breaking
the
charm
merged
with
and
intensified
it
supplied
indeed
the
one
feature
needed
to
perfect
it
a
person
of
his
own
sort
the
expression
is
convenient
a
fellow
citizen
certainly
of
his
period
wearing
its
clothes
speaking
its
speech
but
a
person
happily
not
of
his
own
sex
a
woman
a
beautiful
woman
and
what
her
presence
supplied
to
the
poetry
of
sant
alessina
making
it
complete
was
if
you
like
the
eternal
feminine
as
supplied
already
by
the
painted
women
on
the
walls
about
him
this
force
had
been
static
as
supplied
by
a
woman
who
lived
and
breathed
it
became
dynamic
that
was
all
very
well
if
he
could
have
let
it
rest
at
that
if
he
could
have
confined
his
interest
in
her
his
feeling
about
her
to
the
plane
of
pure
√¶sthetics
he
would
have
had
nothing
to
complain
of
but
the
mischief
was
that
he
could
the
thing
that
perplexed
and
annoyed
him
and
humiliated
him
too
in
some
measure
was
a
craving
that
had
sprung
up
and
was
now
strong
and
constant
to
get
into
personal
touch
with
her
to
make
her
acquaintance
to
talk
with
her
to
find
out
a
little
what
manner
of
soul
she
had
to
establish
some
sort
of
human
relation
with
her
it
in
the
least
as
yet
a
sentimental
craving
or
if
it
was
john
at
any
rate
did
know
it
in
its
essence
perhaps
it
was
little
more
than
curiosity
but
it
was
disturbing
upsetting
it
destroyed
the
peace
and
the
harmonious
leisure
of
his
day
it
perplexed
him
it
was
outside
his
habits
it
was
unreasonable
not
unreasonable
to
think
it
might
be
fun
to
talk
to
a
pretty
woman
he
discriminated
but
unreasonable
to
yearn
to
talk
to
her
as
if
your
life
hung
in
the
balance
and
in
some
measure
too
it
humiliated
him
it
was
a
confession
of
weakness
of
insufficiency
to
himself
of
dependence
for
his
contentment
upon
another
he
tried
to
stifle
it
he
tried
to
fix
his
mind
on
subjects
that
would
lead
far
from
it
every
subject
all
subjects
subjects
the
most
discrepant
seemed
to
possess
one
common
property
that
of
leading
straight
back
to
it
then
he
said
well
if
you
ca
stifle
it
yield
to
it
go
down
into
the
garden
hunt
her
up
boldly
engage
her
in
conversation
assurance
was
the
note
of
the
man
but
when
he
pictured
himself
in
the
act
of
boldly
engaging
her
in
conversation
his
assurance
oozed
away
and
he
was
conscious
of
a
shyness
why
what
there
in
the
woman
that
should
turn
a
brave
man
shy
however
the
stars
were
working
for
him
that
afternoon
coming
home
from
a
stroll
among
the
olives
he
met
her
face
to
face
at
the
gate
of
the
garden
whither
she
had
arrived
from
the
direction
of
the
village
having
made
his
bow
which
she
accepted
with
a
smile
he
could
do
no
less
than
open
the
gate
for
her
and
as
their
ways
must
thence
lie
together
up
the
long
avenue
to
the
castle
it
would
be
an
awkward
affectation
not
to
speak
and
yet
he
ground
his
teeth
at
having
to
admit
it
his
heart
had
begun
to
pound
so
violently
not
from
emotion
he
told
himself
from
a
mere
ridiculous
sort
of
nervous
excitement
what
there
in
the
woman
that
should
excite
a
sane
man
like
that
he
was
afraid
to
trust
his
voice
lest
it
should
quaver
and
betray
him
but
fortunately
this
pounding
of
the
heart
lasted
only
a
few
seconds
the
short
business
of
getting
the
gate
open
and
of
closing
it
afterwards
gave
it
time
to
pass
so
that
now
as
they
set
forwards
towards
the
house
he
was
able
to
look
her
in
the
eye
and
to
observe
with
impressiveness
that
it
was
a
fine
day
she
had
accepted
his
bow
with
a
smile
amiable
and
unembarrassed
and
at
this
in
quite
the
most
unembarrassed
manner
smiling
again
perhaps
with
just
the
faintest
just
the
gentlest
shade
of
irony
and
with
just
the
slightest
quizzical
upward
tremor
of
the
eyebrows
is
it
a
day
rather
typical
of
the
land
and
season
she
inquired
it
was
the
first
step
that
had
cost
john
assurance
was
coming
swiftly
back
her
own
air
of
perfect
ease
in
the
circumstances
very
likely
accelerated
it
yes
he
answered
her
but
surely
that
is
a
reason
for
begrudging
it
a
word
of
praise
by
this
he
was
lucky
enough
to
provoke
a
laugh
a
little
light
gay
trill
sudden
and
brief
like
three
notes
on
a
flute
no
she
admitted
you
are
right
the
day
deserves
the
best
we
can
say
of
it
her
voice
thought
john
availing
himself
of
a
phrase
that
had
struck
him
in
a
book
he
had
lately
read
her
voice
is
like
ivory
and
white
velvet
and
the
touch
never
so
light
of
a
foreign
accent
with
which
she
spoke
rendered
her
english
piquant
and
pretty
gave
to
each
syllable
a
crisp
little
outline
they
sauntered
on
for
a
minute
or
two
in
silence
with
half
the
width
of
the
between
them
the
shaded
where
the
earth
showed
purple
through
a
thin
green
veil
of
mosses
and
where
irregular
shafts
of
sunlight
here
and
there
turned
purple
and
green
to
red
and
gold
the
warm
air
woven
of
hung
round
them
palpable
like
some
infinitely
subtile
fabric
and
of
course
blackbirds
were
calling
blackcaps
and
thrushes
singing
in
all
the
leafy
galleries
overhead
a
fine
day
indeed
mused
john
and
indeed
worthy
of
the
best
that
they
could
say
his
nervousness
his
excitement
had
entirely
left
him
his
assurance
had
come
completely
back
and
with
it
had
come
a
curious
deep
satisfaction
a
feeling
that
for
the
moment
at
any
rate
the
world
left
nothing
to
be
wished
for
that
the
cup
of
his
desire
was
full
he
even
now
that
he
might
do
so
wish
to
talk
to
her
to
walk
with
her
was
enough
to
enjoy
her
companionship
in
silence
yes
that
was
it
companionship
he
caught
at
the
word
that
is
what
i
have
been
unconsciously
needing
all
along
i
flattered
myself
that
i
was
luxuriating
in
the
very
absence
of
it
but
man
is
a
gregarious
animal
and
i
was
deceived
so
he
could
refer
the
effect
of
her
propinquity
to
the
mere
gregarious
instinct
not
suspecting
that
a
more
powerful
instinct
was
already
awake
anyhow
his
sense
of
that
propinquity
his
consciousness
of
her
gracefully
moving
beside
him
in
the
sweet
weather
while
her
summery
garments
fluttered
and
some
strange
faint
elusive
perfume
was
shaken
from
them
filled
him
with
a
satisfaction
that
for
the
moment
seemed
ultimate
he
had
no
wish
to
talk
their
progress
side
by
side
was
a
conversation
without
words
they
were
getting
to
know
each
other
they
were
breaking
the
ice
each
step
they
took
was
as
good
as
a
spoken
sentence
was
a
mutual
experience
drawing
them
closer
helping
to
an
understanding
they
walked
slowly
as
by
a
tacit
agreement
silence
however
could
in
the
nature
of
things
last
for
ever
it
was
she
who
presently
broke
it
i
owe
you
she
said
in
her
ivory
voice
with
her
enunciation
a
debt
of
thanks
and
still
again
she
smiled
as
she
looked
over
towards
him
her
dark
eyes
glowing
her
dark
hair
richly
drooping
in
the
shadow
of
a
big
hat
of
straw
john
eyes
were
at
a
loss
oh
he
wondered
for
a
pleasure
given
me
by
our
friend
annunziata
she
explained
this
morning
she
told
me
a
most
interesting
parable
about
death
and
she
mentioned
that
it
was
you
who
had
suggested
to
her
to
tell
it
me
oh
said
john
laughing
while
the
pink
of
his
skin
deepened
a
shade
she
mentioned
that
did
she
i
glad
if
you
do
feel
that
i
took
a
good
deal
upon
myself
but
she
had
just
told
the
same
parable
to
me
and
it
seemed
a
pity
it
should
have
a
larger
audience
then
after
a
few
more
paces
taken
again
in
silence
what
a
marvellous
little
person
she
is
annunziata
said
maria
dolores
she
to
a
marvellous
degree
the
right
product
of
her
milieu
said
john
maria
dolores
did
not
speak
but
her
eyes
questioned
yes
how
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
she
a
true
child
of
the
presbytery
he
replied
and
at
the
same
time
a
true
child
of
this
italy
where
paganism
has
never
perfectly
died
she
has
been
carefully
instructed
in
her
catechism
and
she
has
fed
upon
pious
legends
she
has
breathed
an
ecclesiastical
atmosphere
until
the
things
of
the
church
have
become
a
part
of
her
very
bone
she
sees
everything
in
relation
to
them
translates
everything
in
terms
of
them
but
at
the
same
time
odd
streaks
of
paganism
survive
in
her
they
survive
a
little
do
they
in
all
italians
wherever
she
goes
her
eye
reads
omens
she
will
cast
your
fortune
for
you
with
the
woods
are
peopled
for
her
by
fauns
and
dryads
when
she
takes
her
walks
abroad
i
no
doubt
she
catches
glimpses
of
proteus
rising
from
the
lake
and
hears
old
triton
blow
his
wreathed
horn
maria
dolores
looked
interested
yes
she
said
slowly
thoughtfully
and
meditated
for
an
interval
you
know
she
recommenced
she
a
sort
of
little
person
about
whom
one
ca
help
feeling
rather
frightened
and
her
eyes
looked
to
his
for
sympathetic
understanding
but
his
were
interrogative
no
why
should
one
feel
frightened
about
her
oh
said
maria
dolores
with
a
movement
it
is
exactly
easy
to
tell
why
one
fears
are
vague
but
well
for
one
thing
she
thinks
so
much
about
death
death
and
what
comes
after
they
interest
her
so
much
it
does
seem
natural
it
makes
one
uneasy
and
then
she
so
sometimes
she
almost
transparent
in
every
way
she
is
too
serious
she
uses
her
mind
too
much
and
her
body
too
little
she
ought
to
have
more
of
the
gaiety
of
childhood
she
ought
to
have
other
children
to
romp
with
she
too
much
like
a
disembodied
spirit
it
all
alarms
one
john
as
she
spoke
frowned
pondering
when
she
had
done
his
frown
cleared
he
shook
his
head
i
do
think
it
need
he
said
her
delicacy
her
frailness
have
never
struck
me
as
indicating
weakness
they
seem
simply
the
proper
physical
accompaniments
of
her
crystalline
little
soul
she
made
of
a
fine
and
delicate
clay
she
thinks
about
death
it
is
true
but
not
in
a
morbid
way
and
that
a
part
of
her
ecclesiastical
tradition
and
she
thinks
quite
as
much
about
life
she
thinks
about
everything
i
agree
with
you
it
a
pity
she
has
no
other
children
but
she
is
by
any
means
deficient
in
the
instincts
of
childhood
she
can
enjoy
a
chocolate
cigar
for
instance
as
well
as
another
and
as
for
marchpane
i
have
her
own
word
that
she
adores
it
maria
dolores
gave
another
light
trill
of
laughter
yes
i
aware
of
her
passion
for
marchpane
she
confided
it
to
me
this
morning
and
as
in
reply
to
her
questions
i
admitted
that
i
rather
liked
it
myself
she
very
generously
offered
to
bring
me
some
this
afternoon
which
to
be
sure
an
hour
ago
she
did
she
laughed
again
and
john
laughed
too
all
the
same
she
insisted
i
ca
help
that
feeling
of
uneasiness
about
her
sometimes
when
i
look
at
her
i
can
almost
see
her
wings
what
will
be
her
future
if
she
grows
up
one
would
rather
not
think
of
her
as
married
to
some
poor
italian
and
having
to
give
herself
to
the
prosaic
sort
of
existence
that
would
mean
the
sordid
sort
of
existence
augmented
john
no
one
would
decidedly
rather
not
but
she
will
never
marry
she
will
enter
religion
her
uncle
has
it
all
planned
out
he
destines
her
for
the
servites
oh
the
servites
the
mantellate
i
am
glad
of
that
exclaimed
maria
dolores
it
is
a
most
beautiful
order
they
have
an
especial
devotion
to
our
lady
of
sorrows
yes
said
john
and
remembered
it
was
for
our
lady
of
sorrows
that
she
who
spoke
was
named
slow
though
their
march
had
been
by
this
time
they
had
come
to
the
end
of
the
avenue
and
were
in
the
wide
circular
sweep
before
the
castle
they
stopped
here
and
stood
looking
off
over
the
garden
with
its
sombre
cypresses
and
bright
beds
of
geranium
down
upon
the
valley
dim
and
luminous
in
a
mist
of
gold
great
heavy
clouds
with
shadows
piled
themselves
up
against
the
scintillant
dark
blue
of
the
sky
in
and
out
among
the
near
at
hand
where
the
sun
was
hottest
heavily
flew
with
a
loud
bourdonnement
the
cockchafers
promised
by
annunziata
big
blundering
clumsy
the
scorn
of
their
and
competitors
the
bees
lizards
lay
immobile
as
lizards
cast
in
bronze
only
their
little
glittering
watchful
of
eyes
giving
sign
of
life
and
of
course
the
blackcaps
never
for
a
moment
left
off
singing
they
stood
side
by
side
within
a
yard
of
each
other
in
silent
contemplation
of
these
things
during
i
do
know
how
many
long
and
for
john
delicious
seconds
yes
he
owned
it
to
himself
it
was
delicious
to
feel
her
standing
there
beside
him
in
silent
communion
with
him
contemplating
the
same
things
enjoying
the
same
pleasantnesses
companionship
companionship
it
was
what
he
had
been
unconsciously
needing
all
along
at
last
she
turned
and
withdrawing
her
eyes
lingeringly
from
the
landscape
looked
into
his
with
a
smile
she
did
not
speak
but
her
smile
said
just
as
explicitly
as
her
lips
could
have
done
what
a
scene
of
beauty
and
john
responded
aloud
with
fervour
indeed
indeed
it
is
and
so
romantic
she
added
it
is
like
a
scene
out
of
some
old
high
musical
romance
the
most
romantic
scene
i
know
said
he
all
my
life
i
have
thought
so
oh
said
she
looking
surprise
have
you
known
it
all
your
life
well
very
nearly
said
he
with
half
a
laugh
i
saw
it
first
when
i
was
ten
then
for
long
years
i
lost
it
and
only
recovered
it
by
accident
a
month
ago
her
face
showed
her
interest
oh
how
was
that
how
did
it
happen
when
i
was
ten
john
recounted
half
laughing
again
i
was
travelling
with
my
father
and
among
the
many
places
we
visited
one
seemed
to
me
a
very
vision
of
romance
made
real
a
vast
and
stately
castle
in
a
garden
in
a
valley
with
splendid
halls
and
chambers
and
countless
beautiful
pictures
of
women
all
my
life
i
remembered
it
dreamed
of
it
longed
to
see
it
again
but
i
had
a
notion
where
it
was
save
vaguely
that
it
was
somewhere
in
italy
and
my
poor
father
being
dead
there
was
no
one
i
could
ask
then
wandering
in
these
parts
a
month
ago
i
stumbled
upon
it
and
recognized
it
though
shrunken
a
good
deal
in
size
to
be
sure
it
was
still
recognizable
and
as
romantic
as
ever
maria
dolores
listened
pensively
when
he
had
reached
his
period
her
eyes
lighted
up
what
a
charming
adventure
she
said
and
so
for
you
besides
its
general
romance
the
place
has
a
personal
one
all
your
own
i
too
have
known
it
for
long
years
but
only
from
photographs
i
suppose
i
should
never
have
seen
the
real
thing
except
for
a
friend
of
mine
coming
to
live
here
i
wonder
said
john
that
the
people
who
own
it
never
live
here
the
prince
of
said
she
no
he
does
like
the
italian
government
since
lombardy
passed
from
austria
to
italy
the
family
have
entirely
given
up
staying
at
sant
alessina
in
those
circumstances
said
john
people
i
should
think
would
get
rid
of
the
place
oh
said
she
laughing
the
prince
in
some
ways
is
enough
he
has
this
great
collection
of
italian
paintings
which
by
italian
law
he
may
remove
from
italian
soil
and
if
he
were
to
get
rid
of
sant
alessina
where
could
he
house
them
in
other
ways
though
he
is
perhaps
not
so
practical
he
is
one
of
those
utopians
who
believe
that
the
present
kingdom
of
italy
must
perforce
before
long
make
shipwreck
and
i
think
he
holds
on
to
sant
alessina
in
the
dream
of
coming
here
in
triumph
and
grandly
celebrating
that
event
i
see
said
john
nodding
that
is
a
beautiful
ideal
said
she
flashing
a
last
quick
smile
into
his
eyes
and
she
moved
away
down
a
garden
path
towards
the
pavilion
beyond
the
clock
iii
and
now
i
should
have
imagined
for
a
single
session
and
that
an
initial
one
he
had
had
enough
i
should
have
expected
him
to
spend
the
remainder
of
his
day
a
full
man
in
thankful
tranquillity
in
agreeable
retrospective
rumination
but
no
indulgence
it
soon
appeared
had
but
whetted
his
appetite
after
a
of
walking
about
the
garden
during
which
his
jumble
of
sensations
and
impressions
her
eyes
her
hair
under
her
hat
her
slender
figure
in
its
fluttering
summery
muslin
and
the
faint
faint
perfume
like
a
memory
of
that
hovered
near
her
her
smile
and
the
curves
when
she
smiled
of
her
lips
and
the
gleam
of
her
teeth
her
laugh
her
voice
her
ivory
voice
her
pretty
english
her
appreciation
of
annunziata
her
disquieting
presentiments
concerning
her
and
his
deep
satisfaction
in
her
propinquity
her
companionship
and
the
long
shaded
fragrant
avenue
and
the
and
the
gentle
weather
after
a
of
anything
but
thankful
tranquillity
a
of
unaccountable
excitement
and
exaltation
during
which
his
jumble
of
impressions
and
sensations
settled
themselves
from
ebullition
into
some
sort
of
quiescence
he
began
to
grow
restlessly
aware
that
so
far
from
having
had
enough
he
had
had
just
a
sufficient
taste
to
make
him
hunger
keenly
for
more
and
more
it
was
ridiculous
but
he
could
help
it
and
as
there
seemed
no
manner
of
likelihood
that
his
hunger
would
soon
be
fed
it
was
trying
at
the
best
he
could
not
reasonably
hope
to
see
her
again
before
and
even
then
what
ghost
of
a
reason
had
he
to
hope
that
even
then
he
could
renew
their
conversation
he
had
owed
that
to
the
bare
hazard
of
their
ways
lying
together
very
likely
at
the
best
he
might
get
a
bow
and
a
smile
very
likely
it
might
be
days
before
he
should
again
have
anything
approaching
a
real
talk
with
her
and
what
a
new
consideration
that
struck
a
sudden
terror
to
his
soul
what
if
her
visit
to
frau
brandt
was
to
be
a
short
one
what
if
even
she
were
to
depart
her
very
ease
in
talking
with
me
a
stranger
may
quite
well
have
been
due
to
the
fact
that
she
knew
she
would
never
see
me
again
he
argued
so
he
was
working
himself
into
a
fine
state
of
despondency
and
the
world
was
rapidly
being
resolved
into
dust
and
ashes
when
heaven
sent
him
a
diversion
nay
indeed
heaven
sent
him
two
diversions
iv
there
was
a
sound
of
wheels
on
gravel
of
horses
hoofs
on
stone
and
lady
blanchemain
great
barouche
rolling
superbly
forth
from
the
avenue
drew
up
before
the
castle
lady
blanchemain
herself
big
and
soft
and
sumptuous
in
silks
and
laces
under
a
silk
sunshade
occupying
the
seat
of
honour
john
hastened
across
the
garden
hat
in
hand
to
welcome
her
jump
in
she
commanded
with
a
smile
and
an
imperious
sweep
of
the
arm
i
have
come
to
take
you
for
a
drive
the
footman
proud
man
held
open
the
door
and
john
jumped
in
but
just
as
the
footman
with
an
air
had
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
before
the
coachman
had
touched
up
his
horses
there
came
a
rhythm
of
running
footsteps
and
the
voice
of
annunziata
called
insistently
prospero
prospero
then
all
out
of
breath
her
pale
cheeks
pink
her
curls
in
disarray
annunziata
arrived
beside
the
carriage
and
no
wise
abashed
by
that
magnificent
equipage
nor
by
the
magnificent
old
lady
throning
in
it
no
wise
abashed
but
from
the
roundness
of
her
eyes
a
good
deal
surprised
and
vastly
curious
she
explained
gasping
a
telegram
and
held
up
to
john
a
envelope
thank
you
said
he
taking
it
and
waving
a
friendly
hand
but
you
should
not
run
so
fast
he
admonished
her
with
concern
whereupon
the
carriage
drove
off
annunziata
standing
and
watching
always
till
it
was
out
of
sight
what
an
child
said
lady
blanchemain
yes
said
john
i
should
have
liked
to
introduce
her
to
you
who
is
she
asked
the
lady
she
the
private
detective
i
told
you
of
she
my
affinity
she
the
young
limb
o
mischief
for
whom
i
ravaged
your
stores
of
marchpane
she
the
niece
of
the
parroco
hum
said
lady
blanchemain
why
does
she
call
you
what
was
it
prospero
she
an
optimist
she
a
bird
of
good
omen
answered
john
satisfied
herself
by
consulting
an
oracle
that
fortune
has
favours
up
her
sleeve
for
me
she
encouragingly
anticipates
them
by
calling
me
prospero
before
the
fact
lady
blanchemain
softly
laughed
that
very
nice
of
her
and
very
wise
are
you
going
to
read
your
telegram
i
did
know
whether
you
permit
said
john
oh
pray
said
she
with
a
gesture
the
carriage
by
this
time
had
left
the
garden
and
the
coachman
had
turned
his
horses
heads
northwards
away
from
the
lake
towards
the
alps
where
their
snowy
summits
attenuated
by
the
sun
and
the
distance
and
the
blue
air
looked
like
vapours
rising
into
the
sky
john
tore
open
his
envelope
read
frowned
and
uttered
a
ejaculation
something
that
sounded
rather
like
i
say
and
vaguely
like
by
jove
no
bad
news
i
hope
inquired
the
lady
sympathetic
and
trying
to
speak
as
if
she
did
know
what
curiosity
meant
excellent
news
on
the
contrary
said
john
but
a
bolt
from
the
blue
and
he
offered
her
the
paper
am
on
my
way
to
rome
she
read
aloud
could
i
come
to
you
for
a
day
winthorpe
hotel
cavour
winthorpe
she
pursed
her
lips
as
one
tasting
something
i
do
know
the
name
who
is
he
what
his
county
she
demanded
she
who
carried
the
county
families
in
her
head
john
chuckled
he
has
got
a
county
he
only
an
american
he
said
pronouncing
that
genial
british
formula
with
intention
oh
sighed
lady
blanchemain
her
expectations
dashed
and
drawing
in
her
skirts
she
sank
a
little
deeper
into
her
corner
he
has
got
a
county
repeated
john
but
he
far
and
away
the
greatest
swell
i
know
a
swell
an
american
lady
blanchemain
pressed
down
her
lips
and
gave
a
movement
to
her
shoulders
an
aristocrat
a
patrician
said
john
fudge
said
lady
blanchemain
americans
and
australians
anything
you
like
but
they
never
that
john
laughed
i
adore
he
said
our
light
and
airy
british
way
of
tarring
americans
and
australians
with
the
same
brush
the
descendants
of
transported
convicts
and
the
descendants
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
is
your
winthorpe
man
a
descendant
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
asked
lady
blanchemain
dryly
indeed
he
is
said
john
he
descended
from
ten
separate
individuals
who
made
the
first
voyage
in
the
and
he
holds
intact
the
lands
that
were
ceded
to
his
family
by
the
indians
the
year
after
that
ought
to
recommend
him
to
your
ladyship
an
unbroken
tenure
of
nearly
three
hundred
years
old
acres
her
ladyship
admitted
cautiously
always
make
for
respectability
besides
john
carelessly
threw
out
he
a
baronet
lady
blanchemain
sat
up
a
baronet
she
said
an
american
alas
yes
said
john
a
mere
american
and
one
of
the
earliest
creations
by
james
the
first
no
less
his
patent
dates
from
but
he
does
use
the
title
he
regards
it
he
pretends
as
merged
in
a
higher
dignity
what
higher
dignity
asked
the
lady
frowning
that
of
an
american
citizen
he
says
chuckled
john
brrr
she
breathed
impatient
and
moreover
john
gaily
continued
besides
being
descended
from
the
pilgrim
fathers
he
descended
in
other
lines
from
half
the
peerage
of
seventeenth
century
england
and
to
top
up
with
if
you
please
descended
from
alfred
the
great
he
only
an
american
but
he
can
show
a
clear
descent
bang
down
from
alfred
the
great
i
think
the
most
exquisite
the
most
subtle
and
delicate
pleasure
i
have
ever
experienced
has
been
to
see
english
people
people
of
yesterday
cheerfully
patronizing
him
you
enlarged
my
sphere
of
knowledge
said
lady
blanchemain
grimly
i
had
never
known
that
there
was
blood
in
america
does
this
prodigious
personage
talk
through
his
nose
worse
luck
no
said
john
i
wish
he
did
a
little
just
enough
to
smack
of
his
soil
to
possess
local
colour
no
he
talks
for
all
the
world
like
you
or
me
which
exposes
him
to
compliments
in
england
american
really
our
tactful
people
cry
when
he
avows
his
nationality
my
word
i
should
never
have
suspected
it
i
suppose
with
all
the
rest
he
rich
asked
lady
blanchemain
immensely
assented
john
speaking
of
fortune
and
her
favours
withheld
none
from
him
then
he
too
he
looks
like
a
man
said
john
hum
said
lady
blanchemain
moving
if
had
received
a
wire
from
a
creature
of
such
proportions
i
a
feeling
i
answer
it
i
a
very
similar
feeling
myself
laughed
john
when
we
turn
back
if
you
think
your
coachman
can
be
persuaded
to
stop
at
the
telegraph
office
in
the
village
i
give
my
feeling
effect
i
think
we
might
turn
back
now
said
lady
blanchemain
it
getting
rather
gloomy
here
she
looked
round
with
a
little
shudder
and
then
gave
the
necessary
order
the
valley
had
narrowed
to
what
was
scarcely
more
than
a
defile
between
two
dark
and
rugged
hillsides
hillsides
that
shut
out
the
sun
smiting
the
air
with
chill
and
shadow
and
turning
the
rampio
whose
brawl
seemed
somehow
to
increase
the
chill
turning
the
sparkling
sportive
rampio
to
the
colour
of
slate
it
puts
one
in
mind
of
brigands
she
said
with
another
little
shudder
but
though
the
air
was
chilly
it
was
wonderfully
keenly
fragrant
with
the
incense
of
the
pines
well
she
asked
when
they
were
facing
homewards
and
your
woman
what
of
her
nothing
said
john
or
anyhow
very
little
it
would
be
extremely
pleasant
he
felt
suddenly
to
talk
of
her
but
at
the
same
time
he
felt
an
extreme
reluctance
to
let
his
pleasure
be
seen
but
your
private
detective
said
lady
blanchemain
were
her
investigations
fruitful
not
very
said
he
she
learnt
little
beyond
her
name
and
age
and
what
her
name
asked
the
lady
her
name
is
maria
dolores
answered
john
and
he
experienced
a
secret
joy
strange
to
him
in
pronouncing
it
maria
dolores
said
lady
blanchemain
and
he
experienced
a
secret
joy
in
hearing
it
maria
dolores
what
my
detective
did
discover
her
pagan
name
said
john
so
that
you
are
still
in
doubt
whether
she
the
daughter
of
a
miller
lady
blanchemain
raised
her
eyebrows
oh
no
i
think
she
a
miller
daughter
safely
enough
said
he
but
she
an
elaborately
chiselled
and
highly
polished
one
her
voice
is
like
ivory
and
white
velvet
and
to
hear
her
speak
english
is
a
revelation
of
the
hidden
beauties
of
that
language
hum
said
lady
blanchemain
eyeing
him
so
you
advanced
to
the
point
of
talking
with
her
well
answered
john
weighing
his
words
i
do
know
whether
i
can
quite
say
that
but
accident
threw
us
together
for
a
minute
or
two
this
afternoon
and
we
could
scarcely
do
less
in
civility
than
exchange
the
time
of
day
and
are
you
in
love
with
her
asked
lady
blanchemain
i
wonder
said
he
what
do
think
is
it
possible
for
a
man
to
be
in
love
with
a
woman
he
seen
only
half
a
dozen
times
all
told
and
spoken
with
never
longer
than
a
minute
or
two
at
a
stretch
it
only
a
minute
or
two
asked
lady
blanchemain
wooing
his
confidence
with
a
glance
no
said
john
it
was
probably
ten
minutes
possibly
fifteen
but
they
passed
so
quickly
it
really
nearer
the
truth
to
describe
them
as
one
or
two
lady
blanchemain
shifted
her
sunshade
and
screwed
herself
half
round
so
as
to
face
him
her
soft
old
eyes
full
of
smiling
scrutiny
and
suspicion
i
never
can
tell
whether
or
not
you
serious
she
complained
if
you
serious
well
quand
le
the
marriage
cried
john
how
could
i
marry
her
such
a
thing
out
of
all
question
why
asked
she
a
miller
daughter
said
john
would
you
have
me
marry
the
daughter
of
a
miller
you
said
yourself
yesterday
the
lady
reminded
him
ah
yes
said
he
but
night
brings
counsel
if
she
well
educated
said
lady
blanchemain
if
she
what
does
it
matter
about
her
father
though
a
nobody
in
austria
where
nothing
counts
but
quarterings
he
probably
what
we
call
a
gentleman
in
england
suppose
he
a
barrister
or
the
editor
of
a
newspaper
or
she
paused
to
think
of
respectable
professions
at
last
she
gave
up
the
effort
well
anything
decent
she
concluded
so
long
as
he
had
plenty
of
money
ah
said
john
sadly
and
with
perhaps
mock
humility
if
he
had
plenty
of
money
he
never
consent
to
his
daughter
marrying
a
son
of
poverty
like
me
pooh
for
a
title
cried
lady
blanchemain
besides
you
have
prospects
is
your
name
prospero
i
have
precious
little
faith
in
oracles
said
john
i
advise
you
to
have
more
said
lady
blanchemain
with
a
smile
that
seemed
occult
and
now
her
carriage
entered
the
village
and
she
put
him
down
at
the
telegraph
office
do
wait
said
john
the
walk
from
here
to
the
castle
is
nothing
and
it
would
take
you
out
of
your
way
well
then
said
she
and
cultivate
more
faith
in
oracles
when
they
auspicious
alone
she
drew
from
some
recondite
fold
of
her
many
draperies
a
letter
an
unsealed
letter
which
she
opened
spread
out
and
proceeded
to
read
it
was
a
long
letter
in
her
ladyship
own
handsome
handwriting
and
it
was
addressed
to
farrow
bernscot
and
tisdale
solicitors
lincoln
inn
fields
london
she
read
it
twice
through
and
at
last
with
a
smile
that
seemed
occult
restored
it
to
its
envelope
stop
at
the
post
office
she
said
to
her
coachman
as
they
entered
roccadoro
and
to
her
footman
giving
him
the
letter
have
that
registered
please
annunziata
lay
in
wait
for
john
in
the
garden
she
ran
up
and
seized
him
by
the
arm
then
skipping
beside
him
as
he
walked
on
who
was
she
where
did
she
come
from
where
did
she
take
you
whom
was
the
telegram
from
she
demanded
in
a
breath
nestling
her
curls
against
his
remonstrated
john
one
question
at
a
time
now
begin
again
whom
was
the
telegram
from
she
obeyed
beginning
at
the
end
ah
said
he
the
telegram
was
from
friend
prospero
he
coming
here
we
must
ask
your
uncle
whether
he
can
give
him
a
bed
and
the
old
lady
pursued
annunziata
who
was
she
the
old
lady
was
my
fairy
godmother
said
john
building
better
than
he
knew
part
fourth
i
pacing
together
backwards
and
forwards
as
they
talked
john
and
his
friend
winthorpe
presented
a
striking
and
perhaps
interesting
contrast
john
was
tall
but
winthorpe
seemed
a
good
deal
taller
though
trifles
in
these
matters
looming
so
large
had
actual
measurements
been
taken
i
dare
say
half
an
inch
would
have
covered
the
difference
john
was
lean
and
sinewy
but
rounded
off
at
the
joints
and
of
a
pliant
carriage
so
that
it
never
occurred
to
you
to
think
of
him
as
spare
figure
spare
and
angular
with
its
greater
height
held
unswervingly
to
the
plane
of
the
perpendicular
appeared
absolutely
to
be
constructed
of
nothing
but
bone
and
tendon
john
head
with
its
yellow
hair
its
curly
beard
verging
towards
red
its
pink
skin
and
blue
eyes
full
of
laughter
might
have
served
a
painter
as
a
model
for
the
head
of
mirth
winthorpe
with
brown
hair
cropped
close
and
showing
the
white
of
the
scalp
but
of
a
steely
tint
where
the
razor
had
passed
with
a
marked
and
a
salient
square
chin
with
a
determined
nose
and
a
white
forehead
rising
vertical
over
thick
black
eyebrows
and
rather
grey
eyes
well
clap
a
hat
upon
it
and
you
could
have
posed
him
for
one
of
his
own
puritan
ancestors
the
very
clothes
of
the
men
carried
on
their
unlikeness
john
loose
blue
flannels
and
red
sailor
knot
but
smart
in
their
effect
and
showing
him
careful
in
a
fashion
of
his
own
winthorpe
black
tie
and
dark
tweeds
as
correct
as
savile
row
could
turn
them
out
yet
somehow
by
the
way
he
wore
them
proclaiming
him
immediately
a
man
who
never
gave
two
thoughts
to
his
dress
if
however
winthorpe
face
was
the
face
of
a
puritan
it
was
the
face
of
a
puritan
with
a
sense
of
humour
the
lines
about
the
mouth
were
clearly
the
footprints
of
smiles
it
seemed
the
face
of
a
sensitive
puritan
as
well
and
maugre
that
nose
of
a
gentle
the
light
in
his
clear
grey
eyes
was
a
kindly
and
gentle
light
after
all
governor
bradford
as
his
writings
show
though
he
tried
hard
perhaps
not
to
let
them
show
it
was
a
puritan
with
a
sense
of
humour
john
alden
and
priscilla
were
surely
sensitive
and
gentle
and
winthorpe
was
descended
from
governor
bradford
and
from
john
alden
and
priscilla
the
two
friends
walked
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
great
open
space
before
the
castle
and
talked
they
had
not
met
for
nearly
two
years
and
had
plenty
to
talk
about
ii
seated
at
one
of
the
open
windows
of
the
pavilion
beyond
the
clock
maria
dolores
in
a
pale
green
confection
of
i
know
not
what
airy
filmy
tissue
looked
down
and
somewhat
vaguely
watched
them
herself
concealed
by
the
netted
curtain
which
according
to
italian
usage
was
hung
across
the
casement
to
mitigate
the
heat
and
shut
out
insects
she
watched
them
at
first
vaguely
and
only
from
time
to
time
for
the
rest
going
on
with
some
needlework
she
had
in
her
lap
but
she
dropped
her
needlework
altogether
and
her
watching
became
continuous
and
absorbed
what
a
man
she
thought
studying
winthorpe
what
an
man
he
looks
like
an
early
christian
martyr
he
looks
like
a
priest
i
believe
he
a
priest
english
priests
she
remembered
when
they
travel
often
dress
as
laymen
yes
he
is
a
priest
and
a
terribly
austere
one
i
should
like
to
go
to
him
for
confession
but
in
spite
of
his
austerity
he
seems
to
be
extraordinarily
happy
about
something
just
at
present
that
light
in
his
eyes
it
is
almost
a
light
of
ecstasy
it
is
a
light
i
have
never
seen
in
any
eyes
save
those
of
priests
and
nuns
winthorpe
while
that
almost
ecstatic
light
shone
in
his
eyes
had
been
speaking
now
as
he
paused
john
with
a
glance
of
gay
astonishment
halted
and
turned
so
as
to
face
him
john
lips
moved
and
it
was
perfectly
plain
that
he
was
exclaiming
delightedly
really
winthorpe
joyously
nodded
whereupon
john
held
out
both
hands
got
hold
of
his
friend
and
his
pink
face
jubilant
shook
them
with
tremendous
heartiness
the
priest
has
received
advancement
he
is
probably
to
be
made
a
bishop
inferred
maria
dolores
and
signor
prospero
is
congratulating
him
the
men
resumed
their
walk
but
for
quite
a
minute
john
kept
his
hand
on
winthorpe
shoulder
and
again
and
again
gently
patted
it
murmuring
i
am
so
glad
so
immensely
glad
maria
dolores
was
quite
sure
that
this
was
what
he
murmured
for
though
no
word
could
reach
her
beaming
face
spoke
louder
than
his
voice
at
last
john
let
his
hand
drop
and
eyebrows
raised
a
little
asked
a
question
but
how
did
it
happen
but
tell
me
all
about
it
was
what
he
seemed
to
say
and
winthorpe
always
with
something
of
that
ecstatic
light
in
his
eyes
proceeded
to
answer
but
it
was
a
longish
story
and
lasted
through
half
a
dozen
of
their
forward
and
backward
ambulations
apparently
furthermore
it
was
a
story
which
as
it
developed
became
less
and
less
agreeable
to
the
mind
of
john
for
his
face
at
first
all
awake
with
interest
all
aglow
with
pleasure
gradually
sobered
gradually
darkened
took
on
a
frown
expressed
dissent
expressed
disapprobation
till
finally
with
an
impatient
movement
he
interrupted
and
began
speaking
rapidly
heatedly
to
protest
to
remonstrate
ah
thought
maria
dolores
the
priest
is
to
be
made
a
bishop
sure
enough
but
a
missionary
bishop
it
is
for
nothing
that
he
looks
like
an
early
christian
martyr
he
is
going
to
some
outlandish
savage
part
of
the
world
where
he
will
be
murdered
by
the
natives
or
die
of
fever
or
loneliness
he
is
a
man
who
has
listened
to
the
counsels
of
perfection
but
his
unascetic
friend
prospero
one
would
say
june
remonstrating
with
december
ca
bring
himself
to
like
it
john
remonstrated
protested
argued
winthorpe
calmly
smilingly
restated
his
purpose
and
his
motives
john
pleaded
implored
appealed
so
the
watcher
read
his
gesture
to
earth
to
heaven
winthorpe
took
his
arm
and
calmly
smilingly
tried
to
soothe
tried
to
convince
him
john
drew
his
arm
free
and
employing
it
to
add
force
and
persuasiveness
to
his
speech
renewed
his
arguments
pointed
out
how
unnecessary
inhuman
impossible
the
whole
thing
was
it
monstrous
it
against
all
nature
there
no
in
it
what
does
it
with
it
wilfully
going
out
of
your
way
to
seek
to
create
wretchedness
my
mind
simply
refuses
to
accept
it
it
was
as
if
maria
dolores
could
hear
the
words
but
winthorpe
calm
and
smiling
would
not
be
moved
john
shook
his
head
muttered
shrugged
his
shoulders
threw
up
his
hands
muttered
again
was
ever
such
obstinacy
was
ever
such
arbitrary
voluntary
blindness
i
give
you
up
for
a
perverse
a
madman
and
so
john
muttering
and
frowning
winthorpe
serenely
smiling
reiterating
they
passed
round
the
corner
of
the
castle
buildings
and
were
lost
to
maria
dolores
view
iii
that
afternoon
seated
on
the
moss
under
a
tall
eucalyptus
tree
near
to
frau
brandt
pavilion
maria
dolores
received
a
visit
from
annunziata
annunziata
pale
little
face
was
paler
her
big
grave
eyes
were
graver
even
than
their
wont
she
nodded
her
head
slowly
portentously
and
her
glance
was
heavy
with
significance
maria
dolores
smiled
what
is
the
matter
she
cheerfully
inquired
ah
sighed
annunziata
deeply
with
another
portentous
i
wish
i
knew
maria
dolores
laughed
sit
down
she
suggested
making
room
beside
her
on
the
moss
and
try
to
think
annunziata
sat
down
curled
herself
up
something
has
happened
to
prospero
she
said
oh
asked
maria
dolores
what
she
seemed
heartlessly
cheerful
and
even
rather
amused
ah
sighed
annunziata
that
is
what
i
wish
i
knew
he
has
had
a
friend
to
pass
the
day
with
him
yes
said
maria
dolores
i
expect
i
saw
his
friend
walking
with
him
this
morning
said
annunziata
they
have
been
walking
about
all
day
friend
prospero
he
calls
him
but
he
does
look
very
prosperous
he
looks
like
a
he
is
long
and
thin
and
dark
and
cold
and
hard
just
like
a
he
would
not
stay
the
night
though
we
had
a
bed
prepared
for
him
he
is
going
to
rome
and
prospero
has
driven
him
to
the
railway
station
at
cortello
i
hate
him
wound
up
annunziata
simply
mercy
exclaimed
maria
dolores
opening
her
eyes
why
do
you
hate
him
because
he
must
have
said
or
done
something
very
unkind
to
prospero
answered
annunziata
oh
you
should
see
him
he
is
so
sad
so
sad
and
so
angry
he
keeps
scowling
and
shaking
his
head
and
saying
things
in
english
which
i
can
not
understand
but
i
am
sure
they
are
sad
things
and
angry
things
and
he
would
not
eat
any
dinner
no
not
that
much
annunziata
measured
off
an
inch
on
her
finger
he
who
always
eats
a
great
deal
ma
molto
and
separating
her
hands
she
measured
off
something
like
twenty
inches
in
the
air
maria
dolores
could
help
laughing
a
little
at
this
but
afterwards
she
said
on
a
key
consolatory
ah
well
he
has
gone
away
now
so
let
us
hope
your
friend
prospero
will
promptly
recover
his
accustomed
appetite
yes
said
annunziata
i
hope
so
but
oh
that
old
man
how
i
hate
him
i
would
like
to
she
clenched
her
little
white
fist
and
shook
it
threateningly
vehemently
while
her
eyes
fiercely
flashed
next
instant
however
her
mien
entirely
changed
like
a
light
extinguished
all
the
fierceness
went
out
of
her
face
making
way
for
what
seemed
pain
and
terror
there
she
cried
pain
and
terror
in
her
voice
i
have
offended
god
oh
i
am
so
sorry
so
sorry
my
sin
my
sin
my
sin
she
murmured
bowing
her
head
and
thrice
striking
her
breast
i
take
back
every
word
i
said
i
do
not
hate
him
i
would
not
hurt
him
i
would
not
even
stick
a
pin
in
him
if
i
had
him
at
my
mercy
no
i
would
do
anything
i
could
to
help
him
i
would
give
him
anything
i
had
that
he
could
want
i
would
give
him
my
coral
rosary
i
would
give
him
she
hesitated
struggled
and
at
last
drawing
a
deep
breath
gritting
her
teeth
in
supreme
renunciation
yes
i
would
give
him
my
tame
kid
she
forced
herself
to
pronounce
with
a
kind
of
desperate
firmness
but
see
she
wailed
her
little
white
brow
a
mesh
of
painful
wrinkles
it
is
all
no
good
god
is
still
angry
oh
what
shall
i
do
and
to
the
surprise
and
distress
of
maria
dolores
she
burst
into
a
sudden
passion
of
tears
sobbing
sobbing
with
that
abandonment
of
grief
which
only
children
know
my
dear
my
dear
exclaimed
maria
dolores
drawing
her
to
her
my
dearest
you
must
cry
like
that
dear
little
annunziata
what
is
it
why
do
you
cry
so
dear
one
answer
me
tell
me
but
annunziata
only
buried
her
face
in
maria
dolores
sleeve
and
moaned
while
long
tremulous
convulsions
shook
her
frail
little
body
maria
dolores
put
both
arms
about
her
hugged
her
close
and
laid
her
cheek
upon
her
hair
darling
annunziata
do
cry
why
should
you
cry
so
dearest
god
is
not
angry
with
you
why
should
you
think
that
god
is
angry
with
you
god
loves
you
darling
everyone
loves
you
there
there
dearest
cry
sweet
one
dear
one
transitions
with
annunziata
were
sometimes
inexplicably
rapid
all
at
once
her
sobbing
ceased
she
looked
up
and
smiled
smiled
radiantly
from
a
face
that
was
wet
and
glistening
with
tears
thanks
be
to
god
she
piously
exulted
god
is
not
angry
any
more
of
course
he
is
said
maria
dolores
tightening
her
hug
and
touching
annunziata
curls
lightly
with
her
lips
but
he
was
never
angry
what
made
you
think
that
god
was
angry
annunziata
big
eyes
widened
did
you
notice
she
asked
in
a
hushed
voice
amazed
no
wondered
maria
dolores
what
was
there
to
notice
he
made
them
draw
a
cloud
over
the
sun
annunziata
whispered
you
notice
that
when
i
said
i
would
like
to
when
i
said
what
i
said
about
that
friend
of
prospero
just
then
they
drew
a
cloud
across
the
sun
that
is
a
sign
that
god
is
angry
the
sun
you
know
is
the
window
in
heaven
through
which
god
looks
down
on
the
world
and
through
which
the
light
of
heaven
shines
on
the
world
and
when
the
window
is
open
we
feel
happy
and
thankful
and
wish
to
sing
and
laugh
but
when
we
have
done
something
to
make
god
angry
with
us
then
he
sends
angels
to
draw
clouds
over
the
window
so
that
we
may
be
shut
out
of
his
sight
and
the
light
of
heaven
may
be
shut
off
from
us
and
then
we
are
lonely
and
cold
and
we
could
quarrel
with
anything
even
with
the
pigs
god
wishes
to
show
us
how
bad
it
would
be
always
to
be
shut
off
from
his
sight
but
now
they
have
drawn
the
cloud
away
so
god
is
not
angry
any
more
i
made
a
good
act
of
contrition
and
he
has
forgiven
me
maria
dolores
smiled
but
under
her
smile
there
was
a
look
of
seriousness
a
look
of
concern
my
dear
she
said
smiling
and
looking
concerned
you
should
try
to
control
your
vivid
little
imagination
if
every
time
a
cloud
crosses
the
sun
you
are
going
to
assume
the
responsibility
for
it
and
to
fancy
that
you
have
offended
god
i
afraid
you
have
rather
an
agitated
life
oh
no
not
time
exclaimed
annunziata
and
she
was
manifestly
on
the
point
of
making
a
fine
distinction
when
abruptly
the
current
of
her
ideas
was
diverted
there
comes
prospero
she
cried
starting
up
i
can
see
the
top
of
his
white
hat
above
the
rhododendron
bushes
he
has
driven
his
friend
to
cortello
and
come
home
i
must
run
away
or
he
will
see
that
i
been
crying
do
tell
him
she
begged
putting
her
finger
on
her
lips
and
she
set
off
running
towards
the
presbytery
just
as
john
stepped
forth
from
behind
the
long
hedge
of
rhododendrons
iv
john
stepped
forth
from
behind
the
rhododendrons
with
a
kind
of
loose
aimless
gait
the
brim
of
his
panama
pulled
brigandishly
down
over
one
ear
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
coat
his
head
bent
his
brow
creased
his
eyes
sombre
every
line
and
fibre
of
his
person
advertising
him
the
prey
of
morose
disgust
but
when
he
saw
maria
dolores
he
hastily
straightened
up
unpocketed
his
hands
took
off
his
hat
giving
it
a
flap
that
set
the
brim
at
a
less
truculent
angle
and
smiled
and
when
the
instant
after
he
caught
sight
of
the
flying
form
of
annunziata
his
smile
turned
into
a
glance
of
wonder
what
is
the
matter
with
annunziata
why
is
she
running
with
all
her
legs
like
that
he
asked
maria
dolores
had
the
tiniest
catch
of
laughter
she
is
running
away
from
you
she
answered
from
marvelled
john
suis
donc
un
foudre
de
guerre
what
on
earth
is
she
running
away
from
me
for
maria
dolores
smiled
mysteriously
ah
she
said
she
asked
me
not
to
tell
you
i
am
in
the
delicate
position
of
confidante
and
therefore
i
hope
you
tell
me
with
the
less
reluctance
said
john
urbanely
unprincipled
a
confidante
always
betrays
her
confidence
to
some
one
that
the
part
of
the
game
that
makes
it
worth
while
maria
dolores
smile
deepened
in
that
pale
green
frock
on
that
bank
of
moss
with
her
complexion
and
her
hair
by
jove
how
stunning
she
is
thought
john
in
a
commotion
well
she
said
annunziata
ran
away
because
she
did
want
you
to
see
that
she
been
crying
john
raised
his
eyebrows
the
blue
eyes
under
them
becoming
expressive
of
dismay
crying
he
echoed
the
poor
little
kiddie
what
had
she
been
crying
about
that
is
a
long
story
and
involves
some
of
her
peculiar
theological
tenets
said
maria
dolores
but
in
a
single
word
about
your
friend
john
eyebrows
descended
to
their
normal
level
and
drew
together
crying
about
my
friend
what
friend
he
puzzled
your
friend
the
priest
the
man
who
has
been
passing
the
day
here
with
you
explained
maria
dolores
john
gave
a
start
threw
back
his
head
and
eyed
her
with
astonishment
that
is
extraordinary
he
exclaimed
what
asked
she
lightly
glancing
up
that
you
should
call
him
my
friend
the
priest
said
john
wagging
a
bewildered
head
why
is
he
a
priest
he
has
all
the
air
of
one
said
maria
dolores
no
he
an
american
millionaire
said
john
succinctly
maria
dolores
moved
in
her
place
and
laughed
dear
me
she
said
i
did
strike
wide
of
the
mark
an
american
millionaire
should
cultivate
a
less
deceptive
appearance
with
that
thin
shaven
face
of
his
and
that
look
of
an
early
christian
martyr
in
his
eyes
and
the
dark
clothes
he
wears
wherever
he
goes
he
sure
to
be
mistaken
for
a
priest
yes
said
john
with
a
kind
of
grimness
that
what
extraordinary
he
comes
of
a
long
line
of
bigoted
protestants
he
a
reincarnation
of
some
of
his
stern
old
puritan
forebears
and
you
find
that
he
looks
like
their
pet
abomination
a
romish
priest
well
you
have
a
prophetic
eye
maria
dolores
gazed
up
inquiringly
a
prophetic
eye
she
questioned
i
merely
mean
said
john
with
thaumaturgic
airiness
that
the
man
is
on
his
way
to
rome
to
study
for
the
priesthood
and
he
gave
a
thaumaturgic
toss
to
his
bearded
chin
oh
cried
maria
dolores
and
leaned
back
against
her
eucalyptus
tree
and
laughed
again
john
however
dejectedly
shook
his
head
and
gloomed
laugh
if
you
will
he
said
though
it
seems
to
me
as
far
as
possible
from
a
laughing
matter
and
i
think
annunziata
chose
the
better
part
when
she
cried
i
beg
your
pardon
said
maria
dolores
perhaps
a
trifle
stiffly
i
was
only
laughing
at
the
coincidence
of
my
having
supposed
him
to
be
a
priest
and
then
learning
that
though
he
is
he
is
going
to
become
one
i
was
not
laughing
at
the
fact
itself
nor
was
it
she
added
her
stiffness
leaving
her
and
a
little
glimmer
of
amusement
taking
its
place
that
fact
which
made
annunziata
cry
i
dare
say
not
responded
john
seeing
that
she
could
possibly
have
known
it
but
it
might
well
have
done
so
it
enough
to
bring
tears
to
the
eyes
of
a
brazen
image
he
angrily
jerked
his
shoulders
what
cried
maria
dolores
surprised
rebukeful
that
a
man
is
to
become
a
holy
priest
oh
no
said
john
that
fact
alone
detached
from
special
circumstances
might
be
a
subject
for
rejoicing
but
the
fact
that
this
particular
man
his
special
circumstances
is
to
become
a
priest
well
i
simply
have
no
words
to
express
my
feeling
he
threw
out
his
arms
in
a
gesture
of
despair
i
simply
sick
with
rage
and
pity
i
could
gnash
my
teeth
and
rend
my
garments
mercy
cried
maria
dolores
stirring
what
are
the
special
circumstances
oh
it
a
grisly
history
said
john
it
a
tale
of
the
wanton
ruthless
needless
purposeless
sacrifice
of
two
lives
it
his
old
black
icy
puritan
blood
winthorpe
that
his
name
had
for
years
been
a
freethinker
far
too
intellectual
and
enlightened
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
to
believe
any
such
old
wives
tale
as
the
christian
religion
he
and
i
used
to
have
arguments
tremendous
ones
in
which
of
course
neither
in
the
least
shook
the
other
darwin
and
spencer
with
a
dash
of
his
native
emerson
were
religion
enough
for
him
then
this
morning
he
arrived
here
and
said
me
a
month
ago
i
was
received
into
the
church
maria
dolores
looked
up
animated
her
dark
eyes
sparkling
how
splendid
she
said
yes
agreed
john
so
i
thought
me
he
said
i
should
think
i
did
congratulate
him
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
but
then
naturally
i
asked
him
how
it
had
happened
what
had
brought
it
to
pass
yes
prompted
maria
dolores
as
he
paused
well
said
john
his
face
hardening
he
thereupon
proceeded
to
tell
me
in
his
quiet
way
with
his
cool
voice
it
like
cold
water
absolutely
the
most
inhuman
story
i
have
ever
had
to
keep
my
patience
and
listen
to
what
was
the
story
asked
maria
dolores
if
you
can
credit
such
inhumanity
it
was
this
answered
john
it
seems
that
he
fell
in
love
with
a
girl
in
boston
where
he
lives
and
what
more
and
worse
the
girl
fell
in
love
with
him
so
there
they
were
engaged
but
she
was
a
catholic
and
his
state
of
unbelief
was
a
cause
of
great
grief
to
her
so
she
pleaded
with
him
and
persuaded
till
merely
to
comfort
her
and
without
the
faintest
suspicion
that
his
scepticism
could
be
weakened
he
promised
to
give
the
catholic
position
a
thorough
reconsideration
to
read
certain
books
and
to
put
himself
under
instruction
with
a
priest
which
he
did
which
he
did
if
you
please
with
the
result
to
his
own
unutterable
surprise
that
one
fine
day
he
woke
up
and
discovered
that
he
been
convinced
that
he
yes
said
maria
dolores
eagerly
yes
and
then
and
the
girl
ah
said
john
with
a
groan
the
girl
that
the
pity
of
it
where
his
black
old
puritan
blood
comes
in
blood
it
is
blood
some
fluid
form
of
stone
it
flint
dissolved
in
vinegar
the
girl
mind
you
she
loved
him
they
were
engaged
to
be
married
well
he
went
to
her
and
said
have
been
converted
i
believe
in
the
christian
religion
your
religion
but
i
ca
believe
a
thing
like
that
and
go
on
living
as
i
lived
when
i
did
believe
it
go
on
living
as
if
it
were
true
or
did
matter
it
does
matter
it
matters
supremely
it
the
only
thing
in
the
world
that
matters
i
believe
it
and
marry
and
live
in
tranquil
indifference
to
it
no
i
must
put
aside
the
thought
of
marriage
the
thought
of
personal
happiness
i
must
sell
all
i
have
and
give
it
to
the
poor
take
up
my
cross
and
follow
him
i
am
going
to
rome
to
study
for
the
priesthood
imagine
groaned
john
stretching
out
his
hands
talking
like
that
to
a
woman
you
are
supposed
to
love
to
a
woman
who
loves
you
and
he
wrathfully
ground
his
heel
into
the
earth
maria
dolores
looked
serious
after
all
he
had
to
obey
his
conscience
she
said
after
all
he
was
logical
he
was
consistent
oh
his
conscience
oh
consistency
cried
john
with
an
intolerant
fling
of
the
body
at
bottom
it
nothing
better
than
common
as
i
took
the
liberty
of
telling
him
to
his
face
the
ardour
of
the
convert
acting
upon
that
acid
solution
of
flint
which
takes
the
place
of
blood
in
his
veins
and
causing
sour
puritanical
impulses
which
like
any
other
voluptuary
he
immediately
gives
way
to
it
nothing
better
than
unbridled
passion
conscience
indeed
where
was
his
conscience
when
it
came
to
think
of
that
poor
girl
that
poor
pale
girl
who
him
oh
mother
of
mercy
he
moved
impatiently
three
steps
to
the
left
three
steps
to
the
right
beating
the
palm
of
one
hand
with
the
back
of
the
other
what
did
she
do
how
did
she
take
it
asked
maria
dolores
what
she
ought
to
have
done
said
john
between
his
teeth
was
to
scratch
his
eyes
out
what
she
did
do
as
he
informed
me
with
a
seraphic
countenance
was
not
merely
to
approve
of
everything
he
said
but
to
determine
to
do
likewise
so
while
he
on
his
way
to
rome
to
get
himself
tonsured
and
becassocked
she
scrubbing
the
floors
of
an
ursuline
convent
as
a
novice
and
there
are
two
lives
spoiled
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
oh
no
no
contended
maria
dolores
earnestly
shaking
her
head
not
spoiled
on
the
contrary
it
is
sad
in
a
way
if
you
like
but
it
is
very
beautiful
it
is
heroic
their
love
must
have
been
a
very
beautiful
love
that
could
lead
them
to
such
two
lives
given
to
god
ca
people
give
their
lives
to
god
without
ceasing
to
cried
john
if
marriage
is
a
sacrament
how
can
they
better
give
their
lives
to
god
than
by
living
sanely
and
sweetly
in
christian
marriage
but
these
people
withdraw
from
life
renounce
life
shirk
and
evade
the
life
that
god
had
prepared
for
them
and
was
demanding
of
them
it
as
bad
as
suicide
besides
it
implies
such
a
totally
perverted
view
of
religion
religion
surely
is
given
to
us
to
help
us
to
to
show
us
to
live
to
enable
us
to
meet
the
difficulties
emergencies
responsibilities
of
life
but
these
people
look
upon
their
religion
as
a
mandate
to
turn
their
backs
on
the
responsibilities
of
life
and
scuttle
away
and
as
for
well
she
no
doubt
did
love
poor
lady
but
winthorpe
no
when
a
man
loves
he
does
send
his
love
into
a
convent
and
go
to
rome
to
get
himself
becassocked
he
gave
his
head
a
nod
of
finality
that
i
fancy
is
a
question
of
temperament
said
maria
dolores
your
friend
has
the
ascetic
temperament
and
it
does
not
by
any
means
follow
that
he
loves
less
because
he
resigns
his
love
what
you
call
an
inhuman
story
seems
to
me
a
wonderfully
noble
one
i
saw
your
friend
this
morning
when
he
and
you
were
walking
together
and
i
said
to
myself
man
looks
as
if
he
had
listened
to
the
counsels
of
perfection
his
vocation
shines
through
him
i
think
you
should
reconcile
yourself
to
his
accepting
it
well
said
john
on
the
tone
of
a
man
ready
to
change
the
subject
i
owe
him
at
least
one
good
mark
his
account
of
his
led
me
to
examine
my
own
and
i
discovered
that
i
am
in
love
myself
which
is
a
useful
thing
to
know
oh
said
maria
dolores
with
a
little
effect
of
reserve
yes
said
john
nothing
daunted
though
unlike
his
mine
is
an
unreciprocated
flame
and
unavowed
ah
said
maria
dolores
reserved
indeed
but
not
without
an
undertone
of
sympathy
yes
said
john
playing
with
fire
and
finding
therein
a
heady
mixture
of
fearfulness
and
joy
the
woman
i
love
does
dream
i
love
her
and
dreams
still
less
of
loving
me
for
which
blessed
circumstance
may
heaven
make
me
truly
thankful
the
sentiment
sounding
unlikely
maria
dolores
raised
doubtful
eyes
they
shone
into
john
his
drank
their
light
and
something
violent
happened
in
his
bosom
oh
she
said
yes
said
he
thinking
what
adorable
little
hands
she
had
as
they
lay
loosely
clasped
in
her
lap
thinking
how
warm
they
would
be
and
fragrant
thinking
too
what
fun
it
was
this
playing
with
fire
how
perilous
and
exciting
and
how
egotistical
he
must
seem
to
her
and
how
nothing
on
earth
should
prevent
him
from
continuing
the
play
yes
he
said
it
a
circumstance
to
be
thankful
for
because
like
winthorpe
himself
though
for
different
reasons
i
unable
to
contemplate
marriage
his
voice
sank
sorrowfully
and
he
made
a
sorrowful
movement
oh
said
maria
dolores
her
sympathy
becoming
more
explicit
winthorpe
too
beastly
puritanical
and
i
too
beastly
poor
said
he
oh
she
murmured
her
eyes
softened
her
sympathy
deepened
to
compassion
she
must
certainly
put
me
down
as
the
most
complacent
egotist
in
two
hemispheres
so
to
regale
her
with
unsolicited
information
about
myself
thought
john
but
surely
it
would
need
six
hemispheres
to
produce
another
pair
of
eyes
as
beautiful
as
hers
yes
he
said
i
should
be
up
if
i
asked
even
a
to
marry
me
maria
dolores
beautiful
eyes
became
thoughtful
as
well
as
compassionate
but
men
who
are
poor
work
and
earn
money
she
said
on
the
tone
that
young
women
adopt
when
the
spirit
moves
them
to
preach
to
young
men
and
when
the
spirit
does
move
them
to
that
things
may
be
looked
upon
as
having
advanced
an
appreciable
distance
the
ball
may
be
looked
upon
as
rolling
so
i
heard
said
john
his
head
in
the
clouds
it
must
be
dull
business
maria
dolores
dimly
smiled
do
do
no
work
she
asked
i
never
had
time
said
john
i
been
too
busy
enjoying
life
oh
said
maria
dolores
with
the
intonation
of
reproach
yes
said
he
enjoying
the
humour
the
romance
the
beauty
of
it
and
combine
the
three
together
make
a
chord
of
you
get
the
divinity
or
to
take
a
lower
plane
the
world
a
stage
and
life
the
drama
i
could
never
leave
off
watching
and
listening
long
enough
to
do
any
work
but
do
you
not
wish
to
play
a
part
in
the
drama
to
be
one
of
the
actors
asked
his
gentle
homilist
have
you
no
ambition
not
an
atom
he
easily
confessed
the
part
of
spectator
seems
to
me
by
far
the
pleasantest
to
sit
in
the
stalls
and
watch
the
incredible
the
of
it
the
gorgeous
squalid
tearful
and
mirthful
pageantry
the
reckless
inconsequences
the
flagrant
impossibilities
to
watch
the
devil
ramping
up
and
down
like
a
hungry
lion
and
to
hear
the
cherubim
choiring
from
the
skies
what
better
entertainment
could
the
heart
of
man
desire
but
are
we
here
merely
to
be
entertained
she
sweetly
preached
while
john
blue
eyes
somewhat
mischievously
laughed
and
he
felt
it
hard
that
he
could
stop
her
mouth
with
kisses
are
we
here
to
be
as
the
phrase
goes
of
use
in
the
world
besides
now
that
you
are
in
love
surely
you
will
never
sit
down
weakly
and
say
am
too
poor
to
marry
and
so
give
up
your
love
like
your
friend
winthorpe
indeed
but
for
ignoble
instead
of
noble
motives
surely
you
will
set
to
work
with
determination
and
earn
money
and
make
it
possible
to
marry
or
else
your
love
must
be
a
very
poor
affair
and
her
adorable
little
hands
as
they
lay
like
white
lilies
thought
john
upon
the
fabric
of
her
gown
unclasped
themselves
opened
wide
for
an
instant
showing
the
faint
pink
of
their
palms
then
lightly
again
interlaced
their
fingers
he
laughed
you
are
delicious
he
said
to
her
fervently
in
silence
my
love
is
all
right
he
said
aloud
i
love
her
as
much
as
it
is
humanly
possible
to
love
i
love
her
with
passion
with
tenderness
with
worship
with
longing
i
love
her
with
wonder
i
love
her
with
sighs
with
laughter
i
love
her
with
all
i
have
and
with
all
i
am
and
i
owe
one
to
winthorpe
for
having
unwittingly
opened
my
eyes
to
my
condition
but
earning
money
i
a
notion
it
difficult
what
could
i
do
have
you
no
profession
she
asked
not
the
ghost
of
one
said
he
with
nonchalance
but
is
there
no
profession
that
appeals
to
you
for
which
you
feel
that
you
might
have
a
taste
her
dark
eyes
were
very
earnest
not
the
ghost
of
one
said
he
dissembling
his
amusement
professions
do
they
all
more
or
less
involve
sitting
shut
up
in
stuffy
offices
among
full
of
dusty
and
futile
papers
doing
tiresome
tasks
for
the
greater
glory
of
other
people
like
a
slave
in
the
hold
of
a
galley
no
if
i
to
work
i
must
work
at
something
that
will
keep
me
above
decks
something
that
will
keep
me
out
of
doors
in
touch
with
the
air
and
the
earth
i
might
become
an
agricultural
labourer
but
that
not
very
munificently
paid
or
a
farmer
but
that
would
require
perhaps
more
capital
than
i
could
command
and
anyhow
the
profits
are
uncertain
i
an
uncle
who
a
bit
of
a
farmer
and
year
in
year
out
i
believe
he
makes
a
loss
what
left
ah
a
gardener
i
do
think
i
should
half
mind
being
a
gardener
maria
dolores
looked
as
if
she
were
sure
whether
or
not
to
take
him
seriously
a
gardener
that
not
very
munificently
paid
either
is
it
she
suggested
trying
her
ground
alas
i
fear
not
sighed
john
then
he
made
a
grave
face
but
would
you
have
me
entirely
mercenary
money
is
everything
here
below
maria
dolores
smiled
she
saw
that
for
the
moment
at
least
he
was
not
to
be
taken
seriously
true
she
agreed
though
it
ran
in
my
mind
that
to
earn
money
so
that
you
might
marry
was
your
only
motive
for
going
to
work
at
all
i
had
forgotten
that
said
the
fellow
i
was
thinking
of
occupations
that
would
keep
one
in
touch
with
the
earth
a
occupation
keeps
him
constantly
in
the
charmingest
possible
sort
of
touch
with
her
and
the
most
intimate
do
they
call
the
earth
in
english
asked
maria
dolores
i
thought
they
said
i
afraid
for
the
greater
part
they
do
answered
john
but
barbarous
of
them
it
unfilial
our
brown
old
mother
fancy
begrudging
her
the
credit
of
her
sex
our
brown
and
green
old
mother
our
kindly
bounteous
mother
our
radiant
our
queenly
mother
old
and
yet
perennially
radiantly
young
look
at
her
now
he
cried
circling
the
garden
with
his
arm
and
pointing
to
the
farther
landscape
look
at
her
shining
in
her
robes
of
pearl
and
gold
shining
and
smiling
one
would
say
a
bride
arrayed
for
the
altar
such
is
her
infinite
variety
her
infinite
variety
her
infinite
abundance
the
fragrance
and
the
sweetness
of
her
oh
i
could
fall
upon
my
face
and
worship
her
like
a
pagan
of
eld
the
earth
and
all
that
grows
and
lives
upon
her
the
blossoming
tree
the
singing
bird
i
could
build
temples
to
her
and
the
crawling
snake
put
in
maria
dolores
a
gleam
at
the
bottom
of
her
eyes
the
crawling
snake
quickly
retorted
john
serves
a
most
useful
purpose
he
establishes
the
of
man
man
and
his
heel
are
here
to
crush
the
serpent
head
maria
dolores
leaned
back
softly
laughing
your
infatuation
for
the
earth
is
so
great
she
said
might
your
if
she
suspected
it
be
jealous
no
said
john
it
is
the
earth
that
might
be
jealous
for
until
i
saw
my
she
was
the
undivided
mistress
of
my
heart
for
the
rest
my
enjoys
upon
this
point
my
entire
confidence
i
have
kept
nothing
from
her
that
is
well
approved
maria
dolores
and
the
sky
and
the
sea
still
softly
laughing
she
asked
have
they
no
place
in
your
affections
the
sky
is
her
and
i
love
the
sky
for
that
said
john
is
the
sky
that
clothes
her
in
her
raiment
and
holds
the
light
whereby
her
beauty
is
made
manifest
and
the
sea
is
a
jewel
that
she
bears
upon
her
bosom
a
magical
jewel
whence
with
the
aid
she
draws
the
soft
rain
that
is
her
scent
and
her
cosmetic
the
fertile
earth
after
soft
showers
do
you
know
i
could
almost
forgive
the
dour
and
detestable
milton
everything
for
the
sake
of
those
seven
words
they
show
that
in
the
sense
of
smell
he
had
at
least
one
attribute
of
humanity
maria
dolores
dark
eyes
were
quizzical
the
dour
and
detestable
milton
she
exclaimed
poor
milton
what
has
he
done
to
merit
such
anathema
it
is
what
he
has
done
but
what
he
was
said
john
that
he
was
dour
nobody
will
deny
dour
and
sour
and
inhuman
ask
those
unfortunate
daughters
of
his
if
you
doubt
it
could
tell
you
stories
but
he
was
worse
he
was
a
scribe
and
a
pharisee
a
pragmatical
canting
old
scribe
and
pharisee
and
he
was
worse
still
and
still
worse
yet
he
was
what
seems
to
me
the
worstest
thing
unhung
he
was
a
puritan
like
winthorpe
his
blood
was
black
and
icy
and
vinegarish
like
winthorpe
but
there
i
abuse
winthorpe
any
more
and
i
must
try
to
forgive
milton
milton
wrote
seven
good
words
and
winthorpe
unwittingly
opened
a
lover
eyes
to
his
condition
he
paused
and
smiled
down
upon
her
and
his
newly
opened
and
very
blue
blue
eyes
said
much
her
eyes
were
dreaming
on
the
landscape
where
it
shone
in
pearl
and
gold
however
as
she
gave
no
sign
of
finding
his
conversation
wearisome
he
took
heart
and
continued
for
when
he
told
me
how
he
had
put
his
love
away
never
again
to
see
her
and
how
at
that
moment
she
would
be
scrubbing
floors
or
taking
the
discipline
perhaps
in
a
convent
of
ursulines
suddenly
and
without
any
action
of
the
will
on
my
part
there
rose
before
me
the
vision
of
a
certain
woman
a
woman
i
knew
a
little
admired
immensely
very
much
liked
but
did
for
an
instant
suppose
i
was
seriously
in
love
with
and
involuntarily
with
the
vision
of
her
before
me
i
asked
myself
whether
i
could
have
done
as
he
had
and
in
a
flash
i
saw
that
i
could
not
that
not
for
the
wealth
of
ormus
and
of
ind
could
i
or
would
i
give
her
up
if
once
i
had
her
so
by
that
token
and
by
the
uncommon
wrath
with
which
his
tale
inflamed
me
john
with
a
rhetorical
flourish
perorated
i
discovered
that
i
loved
and
again
his
eyes
said
much
hers
were
still
on
the
prospect
yet
if
you
only
know
her
a
little
how
can
you
love
her
she
asked
in
a
musing
voice
did
i
say
i
only
know
her
a
little
asked
john
i
know
her
a
great
deal
i
know
her
through
and
through
i
know
that
she
is
pure
gold
pure
crystal
that
she
is
made
of
all
music
all
light
all
sweetness
and
of
all
shadow
and
silence
and
mystery
too
as
women
should
be
i
know
that
earth
holds
naught
above
her
i
do
not
care
to
employ
superlatives
so
to
put
it
in
the
form
of
an
understatement
i
know
that
she
is
simply
and
absolutely
perfect
if
you
could
see
her
if
you
could
see
her
eyes
her
witty
humorous
mischievous
innocent
eyes
with
the
soul
that
burns
in
them
the
passion
that
sleeps
if
you
could
see
the
black
soft
masses
of
her
hair
and
her
white
brow
and
the
of
her
cheeks
and
the
of
her
lovely
smiling
mouth
if
you
could
see
her
figure
slender
and
strong
and
the
grace
and
pride
of
her
carriage
the
carriage
of
an
imperial
princess
if
you
could
see
her
hands
they
lie
in
her
lap
like
languid
lilies
and
her
voice
is
the
colour
of
her
mouth
and
the
glow
of
her
eyes
made
audible
and
if
you
could
whisper
to
yourself
her
melodious
and
thrice
adorable
name
i
know
her
a
great
deal
when
i
said
that
i
only
knew
her
a
little
i
meant
it
in
the
sense
that
she
only
knows
me
a
little
which
after
all
alas
for
practical
purposes
comes
to
the
same
thing
he
had
spoken
with
emphasis
with
fervour
his
pink
face
animated
and
full
of
intention
maria
dolores
kept
her
eyes
resolutely
away
from
him
but
i
think
the
soul
that
burned
in
them
if
not
the
passion
that
slept
was
vaguely
troubled
pane
how
does
the
french
proverb
run
did
she
vaguely
feel
perhaps
that
the
seas
they
were
sailing
were
perilous
anyhow
as
john
saw
with
sinking
heart
she
was
at
the
point
of
putting
an
end
to
their
present
conjunction
she
was
preparing
to
rise
he
would
have
given
worlds
to
offer
a
helping
hand
but
however
rich
in
worlds
he
was
for
the
occasion
poor
in
courage
when
love
comes
in
at
the
door
assurance
as
like
as
not
will
fly
out
of
the
window
so
she
rose
unaided
let
us
hope
she
said
giving
him
a
glance
in
which
he
perceived
an
as
of
not
unfriendly
mockery
that
she
will
soon
come
to
know
you
better
heaven
forbid
cried
he
with
a
fine
simulation
of
alarm
it
is
upon
her
ignorance
of
my
true
character
that
i
base
such
faint
hopes
as
i
possess
of
some
day
winning
her
esteem
maria
dolores
laughed
nodded
and
lightly
moved
away
my
son
said
john
to
himself
you
steered
precious
close
to
the
wind
you
had
best
be
careful
and
then
he
was
conscious
of
a
sudden
change
in
things
the
garden
smiled
about
him
the
valley
below
laughed
in
the
breeze
the
blackcaps
sang
the
many
windows
of
the
castle
glistened
in
the
sun
but
their
beauty
and
their
pleasantness
had
departed
had
retired
with
her
into
the
long
low
pavilion
he
was
conscious
of
a
sudden
change
in
things
and
of
a
sudden
acute
and
bitter
depression
within
himself
these
are
great
larks
he
said
great
larks
while
they
last
but
what
the
good
of
them
in
the
end
what
do
they
lead
to
what
the
good
of
coquetting
with
blisses
that
ca
be
yours
and
he
breathed
a
prodigious
sigh
when
shall
i
see
her
again
he
asked
and
thereupon
was
seized
by
his
old
terror
his
terror
of
yesterday
though
it
seemed
to
him
a
terror
he
had
known
all
his
life
lest
he
should
never
see
her
again
she
only
a
visitor
what
to
prevent
her
leaving
this
very
night
the
imagination
was
intolerable
he
entered
the
castle
court
and
climbed
the
staircase
of
honour
and
rambled
through
the
long
suites
of
great
empty
rooms
empty
of
everything
save
the
memory
of
the
past
and
the
portraits
of
the
dead
there
if
he
might
for
a
time
at
least
to
lose
himself
and
to
forget
her
v
who
is
the
young
man
you
have
been
talking
with
so
long
asked
frau
brandt
as
maria
dolores
came
into
her
a
vast
square
bare
room
with
a
marble
floor
and
a
painted
ceiling
with
venetian
blinds
to
shelter
it
from
the
sun
and
a
smell
as
of
rosemary
or
i
know
not
what
other
aromatic
herb
upon
its
cool
air
oh
you
saw
us
said
maria
dolores
answering
the
question
with
question
him
i
have
seen
many
times
every
day
for
a
week
at
least
said
frau
brandt
but
i
never
before
saw
you
talking
with
him
who
is
he
she
was
a
small
brown
old
woman
in
a
big
round
starched
white
cap
and
a
flowing
black
silk
gown
she
sat
in
an
uncushioned
oaken
armchair
by
the
window
with
some
white
knitting
in
her
bony
brown
hands
and
spectacles
on
her
nose
but
the
spectacles
could
hide
the
goodness
or
the
soundness
or
the
sweetness
that
looked
forth
from
her
motherly
old
honest
brown
eyes
he
is
a
young
man
who
lives
at
the
presbytery
said
maria
dolores
a
young
englishman
so
said
frau
brandt
what
is
his
name
i
do
know
said
maria
dolores
with
disengagement
real
or
feigned
his
christian
name
i
believe
is
john
but
his
family
name
persisted
frau
brandt
it
is
probably
brown
jones
or
robinson
said
maria
dolores
or
it
may
even
be
black
smith
or
johnson
most
englishmen
are
named
one
or
the
other
so
said
frau
brandt
but
is
it
prudent
or
seemly
for
you
to
talk
familiarly
with
a
young
man
whose
name
is
unknown
to
you
why
not
asked
maria
dolores
raising
her
eyebrows
as
if
surprised
he
seems
a
very
harmless
young
man
i
do
think
he
will
eat
me
and
he
is
english
and
i
like
english
people
and
he
is
intelligent
his
conversation
amuses
me
and
he
has
nice
easy
impetuous
manners
so
different
from
the
formality
and
restraint
of
austrian
young
men
what
can
his
name
matter
but
frau
brandt
looked
up
impressively
over
her
spectacles
and
her
voice
was
charged
with
gravity
for
she
was
about
to
ask
a
question
to
the
teutonic
mind
of
quite
supreme
importance
but
is
he
noble
it
was
to
her
what
nay
more
than
what
the
question
is
he
respectable
would
have
been
to
an
englishwoman
maria
dolores
laughed
oh
no
she
said
at
least
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
not
and
i
devoutly
hope
not
he
belongs
i
expect
to
what
they
call
in
england
the
middle
class
he
has
an
uncle
who
is
a
farmer
frau
brandt
good
old
brown
eyes
showed
her
profoundly
shocked
and
expressed
profound
reprehension
but
you
were
speaking
with
him
familiarly
you
were
speaking
with
him
almost
as
an
equal
she
pronounced
in
bated
accents
in
accents
of
consternation
again
maria
dolores
laughed
true
she
assented
gaily
and
that
is
exactly
what
i
could
do
if
he
noble
then
i
should
have
to
remember
our
respective
positions
but
where
the
difference
of
rank
is
so
great
one
can
talk
familiarly
without
fear
√†
frau
brandt
nodded
her
head
for
full
half
a
minute
with
many
meanings
she
nodded
it
now
up
and
down
and
now
shook
it
sidewise
i
do
not
like
it
she
said
at
last
your
brother
would
not
like
it
it
is
not
becoming
well
thanks
be
to
heaven
he
is
only
english
oh
of
course
agreed
maria
dolores
if
he
were
austrian
it
would
be
entirely
different
but
is
it
fair
to
the
young
man
himself
pursued
frau
brandt
is
he
aware
that
he
is
hobanobbing
with
a
serene
highness
you
treat
him
as
an
equal
what
if
he
should
fall
in
love
with
you
what
indeed
but
he
wo
laughed
maria
dolores
possibly
with
a
mental
reservation
who
can
tell
said
frau
brandt
his
eyes
when
he
looked
at
you
had
an
expression
but
there
is
a
greater
danger
still
you
are
both
at
the
dangerous
age
he
is
what
if
your
heart
should
become
interested
in
him
oh
in
that
case
answered
maria
dolores
lightly
her
chin
a
little
in
the
air
i
should
marry
him
if
he
asked
me
what
cried
frau
brandt
half
rising
from
her
chair
yes
said
maria
dolores
cheerfully
unexcited
he
is
a
man
of
breeding
and
education
even
if
he
is
noble
if
i
loved
a
man
i
should
give
one
thought
to
his
birth
i
tired
of
all
our
austrian
insistence
upon
birth
upon
birth
and
quarterings
and
precedencies
if
ever
i
love
i
shall
love
some
one
just
for
what
he
is
for
what
god
has
made
him
and
for
nothing
else
it
would
matter
if
his
father
were
a
cobbler
if
i
loved
him
i
marry
him
her
chin
higher
in
the
air
she
had
every
appearance
of
meaning
what
she
said
frau
brandt
had
sunk
back
in
her
chair
and
was
nodding
her
old
head
again
oh
my
child
my
child
she
grieved
will
you
never
rid
your
fancy
of
these
unpractical
romantic
whimsies
it
all
comes
of
reading
poetry
she
herself
good
woman
read
little
but
her
prayers
oh
my
dear
true
heart
responded
maria
dolores
laughing
she
crossed
the
room
and
placed
her
hand
affectionately
upon
frau
shoulder
my
dearest
old
nurse
do
not
distress
yourself
this
is
not
yet
a
question
of
actuality
let
us
not
cry
before
we
are
hurt
and
she
stooped
and
kissed
her
nurse
brown
old
brow
but
afterwards
she
stood
looking
with
great
pensiveness
out
of
the
window
stood
so
for
a
long
while
and
i
fancy
there
was
a
softer
glow
than
ever
in
her
eyes
and
perhaps
a
livelier
rose
in
her
cheeks
what
are
you
thinking
so
deeply
about
frau
brandt
asked
maria
dolores
woke
with
a
little
start
and
turned
from
the
window
and
laughed
again
oh
thinking
about
my
cobbler
son
of
course
she
said
vi
annunziata
seeking
him
to
announce
that
supper
was
ready
found
john
seated
in
his
chamber
of
dead
ladies
his
arms
folded
his
legs
crossed
his
eyes
fixed
a
frown
upon
his
prone
brow
his
spirit
apparently
rapt
in
a
brown
study
eh
prospero
she
called
whereat
he
came
to
himself
glanced
up
glanced
round
changed
his
posture
and
finally
rising
blew
his
preoccupations
from
him
in
a
deep
deep
sigh
oh
what
a
sigh
marvelled
annunziata
making
big
eyes
what
are
you
sighing
so
hard
for
john
looked
at
her
and
smiled
sighing
for
my
miller
daughter
my
dear
he
said
and
as
he
followed
her
to
the
presbytery
he
sang
softly
to
himself
it
is
the
miller
daughter
and
she
is
grown
so
dear
so
dear
that
i
would
be
the
jewel
that
trembles
in
her
ear
part
fifth
i
it
was
sunday
it
was
early
morning
it
was
raining
a
fine
quiet
determined
rain
that
blurred
the
lower
reaches
of
the
valley
and
entirely
hid
the
so
that
one
found
it
hard
not
to
doubt
a
little
whether
they
were
still
there
near
at
hand
the
garden
was
as
if
a
thin
web
of
silver
had
been
cast
over
it
pale
and
dim
where
wet
surfaces
reflected
the
diffused
daylight
and
just
across
the
rampio
on
the
hillside
that
rose
abruptly
from
its
brink
rather
an
interesting
process
was
taking
place
the
fabrication
of
clouds
no
less
the
hillside
with
its
rondure
of
foliage
would
lie
for
a
moment
quite
bare
and
clear
then
at
some
high
point
a
mist
would
begin
to
form
would
appear
indeed
to
issue
from
the
earth
as
smoke
from
a
subterranean
fire
white
smoke
with
pearly
shadows
would
thicken
and
spread
out
would
draw
together
and
rise
in
an
irregular
spiral
column
curling
swaying
poising
as
if
uncertain
what
to
do
next
and
at
last
all
at
once
making
up
its
mind
how
like
a
younker
or
a
prodigal
would
go
sailing
away
straggling
away
amorphous
on
a
puff
of
wind
leaving
the
hillside
clear
again
till
presently
the
process
would
recommence
john
and
annunziata
seated
together
on
a
marble
bench
in
the
shelter
of
the
great
cloister
with
its
faded
frescoes
at
the
extremity
of
the
castle
buildings
had
been
watching
this
for
some
minutes
in
silence
but
annunziata
spoke
what
makes
the
cloud
come
out
of
the
hill
like
that
she
asked
her
eyes
anxiously
questioning
his
i
have
seen
it
happen
many
times
but
i
could
never
understand
it
there
can
not
be
a
fire
underneath
if
ca
understand
it
mistress
wisdom
responded
john
smiling
on
her
you
surely
must
expect
a
featherpate
like
me
to
between
ourselves
i
do
believe
any
one
can
really
understand
it
though
there
a
variety
of
the
human
species
called
scientists
who
might
pretend
they
could
it
all
a
part
of
that
great
scheme
of
miracles
by
which
god
world
goes
on
nature
which
nobody
can
really
understand
in
the
very
least
all
that
the
chaps
called
scientists
can
really
do
is
to
observe
and
more
or
less
give
names
to
the
miracles
they
ca
explain
it
is
great
pleasure
to
watch
such
things
said
annunziata
it
is
a
great
blessing
to
be
allowed
to
see
a
miracle
performed
with
your
own
eyes
so
it
is
agreed
john
and
if
you
keep
your
eyes
well
open
not
a
minute
of
the
livelong
day
when
you
may
see
one
it
is
very
strange
said
annunziata
but
when
the
sun
shines
then
i
love
the
sunny
weather
and
am
glad
that
it
does
not
rain
yet
when
it
does
rain
then
i
find
that
i
love
the
rain
too
that
i
love
it
just
as
much
as
the
sun
it
is
so
fresh
it
smells
so
good
the
raindrops
are
so
pretty
and
they
make
such
a
pretty
sound
where
they
fall
and
the
grey
light
is
so
pleasant
our
loves
said
john
are
always
very
strange
love
is
the
rummest
miracle
of
them
all
it
is
even
more
difficult
to
account
for
than
the
formation
of
clouds
on
the
hillside
we
love
the
things
that
give
us
pleasure
said
annunziata
and
the
people
sometimes
who
give
us
pain
said
john
we
love
the
people
first
of
all
who
are
related
to
us
said
annunziata
and
then
the
people
we
see
a
great
deal
of
just
as
i
love
first
of
all
my
uncle
and
then
you
and
marcella
the
cook
who
brings
in
the
inevitable
veal
said
john
thank
you
honeymouth
he
bowed
and
laughed
while
annunziata
grave
eyes
wondered
what
he
was
laughing
at
but
it
is
every
one
he
pointed
out
who
has
your
solid
and
little
it
is
every
one
who
keeps
his
love
so
neatly
docketed
or
so
sanely
submitted
to
the
sway
of
reason
some
of
us
love
first
of
all
people
who
are
related
to
us
in
the
remotest
degree
and
people
we
seen
hardly
anything
of
and
know
next
to
nothing
about
annunziata
deprecatingly
shook
her
head
it
is
foolish
to
love
people
we
know
nothing
about
she
declared
in
her
deep
voice
and
looked
a
very
sage
delivering
judgment
true
enough
said
john
but
what
would
you
have
some
of
us
are
born
to
folly
as
the
sparks
fly
upward
you
see
there
a
mighty
difference
between
love
and
love
there
the
love
which
is
affection
there
the
love
which
is
and
there
the
love
which
is
just
simply
and
nothing
else
the
first
as
you
have
truly
observed
has
its
roots
in
consanguinity
or
association
the
second
in
a
lively
hope
of
future
comfits
and
either
is
sufficiently
explicable
but
the
third
has
its
roots
apparently
in
mere
haphazard
and
causelessness
and
explicable
by
any
means
whatsoever
and
yet
is
far
and
away
the
violentest
of
the
three
it
falls
as
the
lightning
from
the
clouds
and
strikes
whom
it
will
though
i
mix
my
metaphors
fearlessly
like
a
man
i
trust
with
your
feminine
intuition
you
follow
me
no
said
annunziata
without
compunction
her
eyes
on
the
distance
i
do
know
what
you
mean
thank
heaven
you
do
pray
heaven
you
never
may
said
her
inconsequential
friend
for
is
a
plague
you
meet
a
person
for
example
in
a
garden
you
know
nothing
whatever
about
her
not
even
her
name
though
you
fear
it
may
be
schmidt
you
meet
her
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
times
all
told
and
suddenly
one
morning
you
wake
up
to
discover
that
she
has
become
to
you
the
person
of
first
importance
in
the
world
she
is
practically
a
total
stranger
to
you
she
of
a
different
nationality
a
different
rank
yet
she
infinitely
the
most
precious
and
important
person
in
the
world
when
you
absent
from
her
you
can
do
nothing
but
think
of
her
gloating
with
throes
of
aromatic
pain
over
the
memory
of
your
last
meeting
with
her
longing
with
for
your
next
the
merest
flutter
of
her
gown
modulation
of
her
voice
glance
of
her
eye
will
throw
your
heart
into
a
palpitation
you
look
in
the
direction
of
the
house
that
she
inhabits
and
you
feel
the
emotions
of
a
peri
looking
at
the
gate
of
eden
and
it
gives
you
the
strangest
sort
of
strange
joy
to
talk
about
her
though
of
course
you
take
pains
to
talk
about
her
in
veiled
terms
obliquely
so
that
your
listener
sha
guess
you
are
talking
about
in
short
she
is
the
and
the
of
your
existence
and
you
do
even
know
her
name
though
you
fear
it
may
be
schmidt
he
lolled
back
at
ease
on
the
marble
bench
and
twirled
his
moustaches
fancy
free
but
you
do
know
her
name
said
annunziata
simply
in
her
deepest
voice
holding
him
with
a
gaze
lucent
and
serious
that
seemed
almost
reproachful
her
name
is
maria
dolores
the
thing
was
tolerably
unexpected
what
wonder
if
it
put
my
hero
out
of
countenance
his
attitude
grew
rigid
his
pink
skin
three
shades
pinker
his
blue
eyes
stared
at
her
startled
so
for
a
second
then
he
relaxed
and
laughed
laughed
long
and
heartily
perhaps
a
little
despitefully
too
at
his
own
expense
but
he
must
try
if
he
might
to
repair
the
mischief
my
poor
child
he
said
resting
his
hand
on
her
curls
and
gently
smoothing
them
you
are
what
the
french
call
an
you
are
what
the
english
call
a
deuced
sharp
little
pickle
and
i
must
try
if
i
can
without
actually
lying
to
persuade
you
that
you
are
utterly
mistaken
utterly
and
absolutely
mistaken
he
raised
his
voice
for
greater
convincingness
and
that
her
name
is
nothing
distantly
resembling
the
name
that
you
have
spoken
and
that
in
fact
her
name
is
harris
and
that
in
fine
there
is
no
such
person
and
that
i
was
merely
talking
hypothetically
in
abstractions
i
must
draw
a
herring
across
the
trail
i
must
raise
a
dust
and
throw
a
lot
of
it
into
your
amazingly
little
eyes
now
is
it
definitely
impressed
upon
you
that
her
name
is
the
name
you
mentioned
i
thought
it
was
answered
annunziata
i
am
sorry
it
is
not
and
then
she
dismissed
the
subject
see
it
is
raining
harder
see
how
the
rain
comes
down
in
long
strings
of
beads
see
how
it
is
like
a
network
of
long
strings
of
glass
beads
falling
through
the
air
when
the
rain
comes
down
like
that
it
means
that
after
the
rain
stops
it
will
be
very
hot
it
will
be
very
hot
the
bell
in
the
tolled
out
seven
solemn
strokes
then
the
and
bell
of
the
church
began
to
ring
come
peremptorily
said
annunziata
jumping
up
mass
she
held
out
her
hand
took
john
and
like
a
mother
led
the
meek
and
unquestioning
young
man
to
his
duties
ii
of
course
there
are
no
such
heretical
inventions
as
pews
in
the
parish
church
of
sant
alessina
you
sit
upon
orthodox
chairs
you
kneel
upon
orthodox
bare
stones
but
at
the
epistle
side
of
the
altar
at
an
elevation
of
perhaps
a
yard
from
the
pavement
there
is
a
recess
in
the
wall
enclosed
by
a
marble
balustrade
and
hung
with
faded
red
curtains
which
looks
i
afraid
a
good
deal
like
a
private
box
at
a
theatre
and
is
in
fact
the
tribune
reserved
for
the
masters
of
the
castle
in
former
days
those
masters
were
the
sforzas
so
from
this
tribune
the
members
of
that
race
of
iron
and
blood
of
fierceness
and
of
guile
have
assisted
at
the
mystical
sacrifice
of
the
lamb
of
god
heretofore
during
john
residence
at
the
presbytery
the
tribune
had
stood
vacant
it
was
occupied
by
maria
dolores
and
frau
brandt
maria
dolores
instead
of
wearing
a
hat
had
adopted
the
ancient
and
beautiful
use
of
draping
a
long
veil
of
black
lace
over
her
dark
hair
john
knelt
in
the
middle
of
the
church
in
the
thick
of
the
ragged
dirty
unsavoury
villagers
when
mass
was
over
he
returned
to
the
cloisters
and
there
face
to
face
he
met
the
lady
of
his
dreams
she
graciously
inclined
her
head
good
morning
she
said
smiling
in
a
voice
that
seemed
to
him
full
of
morning
freshness
good
morning
he
responded
wondering
whether
she
could
hear
the
tremor
of
his
heart
though
in
honest
truth
it
rather
a
bad
morning
is
it
he
submitted
posing
his
head
at
an
angle
dubious
and
reflective
that
seemed
to
raise
the
question
to
a
level
of
philosophic
import
oh
with
these
cloisters
one
should
complain
said
she
glancing
indicatively
round
one
can
still
be
out
of
doors
and
yet
not
get
the
wetting
one
deserves
and
the
view
is
so
fine
and
these
faded
old
frescoes
are
so
droll
yes
said
he
his
wits
for
the
instant
in
a
state
of
suspended
animation
the
view
is
fine
the
frescoes
are
droll
she
looked
as
if
she
were
thinking
about
something
do
you
find
it
she
asked
after
a
moment
with
the
slightest
bepuzzled
drawing
together
of
her
eyebrows
a
trifle
unpleasant
hearing
mass
from
where
you
do
john
looked
blank
unpleasant
no
why
he
asked
i
should
think
it
might
be
disagreeable
to
be
hemmed
in
and
elbowed
by
those
extraordinarily
ragged
and
dirty
people
she
explained
it
a
pity
they
should
clean
themselves
up
a
little
before
coming
to
church
ah
yes
he
assented
a
little
cleaning
up
would
hurt
them
very
certain
but
he
set
forth
in
extenuation
it
not
the
custom
of
the
country
and
the
fact
that
it
is
has
its
good
significance
as
well
as
its
bad
it
one
of
the
many
signs
of
how
genuinely
democratic
and
popular
the
church
is
in
italy
as
it
ought
to
be
everywhere
it
is
here
essentially
the
church
of
the
people
the
church
of
the
poor
it
is
the
one
place
where
the
poorest
man
in
all
his
rags
and
with
the
soil
of
his
work
upon
him
feels
perfectly
at
ease
perfectly
at
home
perfectly
equal
to
the
richest
it
is
the
one
place
where
a
reeking
with
her
basket
on
her
arm
will
feel
at
liberty
to
take
her
place
beside
the
great
lady
in
her
furs
and
velvets
and
even
to
ask
her
with
a
nudge
to
move
up
and
make
room
that
is
as
it
should
be
is
it
no
doubt
no
doubt
agreed
maria
dolores
beginning
to
pace
backwards
and
forwards
over
the
marble
pavement
stained
as
by
the
hand
of
an
artist
in
wavy
veins
of
yellow
or
with
here
and
there
little
rosettes
of
scarlet
while
john
kept
beside
her
all
the
same
i
should
not
like
to
kneel
quite
in
the
very
heart
of
the
crowd
as
you
do
you
are
a
delicate
and
sensitive
woman
he
reminded
her
i
am
a
man
and
a
moderately
tough
one
however
i
must
admit
that
until
rather
recently
i
had
exactly
your
feeling
but
i
got
a
lesson
he
broke
off
and
gave
a
vague
little
laugh
vaguely
rueful
as
at
a
not
altogether
pleasant
reminiscence
what
was
the
lesson
she
asked
well
said
he
if
you
care
to
know
it
was
this
the
first
time
that
i
attended
mass
here
desiring
to
avoid
the
people
i
sought
out
a
far
corner
of
the
church
behind
a
pillar
where
there
was
no
one
but
as
soon
as
i
had
got
myself
well
established
there
up
hobbled
a
deformed
and
lame
old
man
and
plumped
himself
down
beside
me
so
close
that
our
touched
i
think
he
was
the
most
old
man
i
have
ever
seen
he
was
certainly
the
dirtiest
the
grimiest
and
his
rags
were
extravagantly
foul
i
will
spare
you
a
more
circumstantial
portrait
and
all
through
mass
i
was
sick
with
disgust
and
sore
with
resentment
why
should
he
come
and
rub
his
against
mine
when
there
was
room
in
plenty
for
him
elsewhere
the
next
time
i
went
to
church
i
chose
a
different
corner
as
remote
as
might
be
from
my
former
one
but
again
no
sooner
was
i
well
installed
than
lo
and
behold
the
same
unspeakable
old
man
limped
up
and
knelt
with
me
cheek
by
jowl
and
so
if
you
can
believe
it
the
next
time
and
so
the
next
it
matter
where
i
placed
myself
there
he
was
sure
to
place
himself
too
you
will
suppose
that
apart
from
my
annoyance
i
was
vastly
perplexed
why
should
he
pursue
me
so
who
was
he
what
was
he
after
and
for
enlightenment
i
addressed
myself
to
annunziata
is
the
hideous
old
man
who
always
kneels
beside
me
i
asked
her
she
had
not
noticed
any
one
kneeling
beside
me
she
said
she
had
noticed
on
the
contrary
that
i
always
knelt
alone
at
a
distance
said
i
your
eyes
open
and
you
will
see
the
man
i
mean
so
we
went
to
mass
and
sure
enough
no
sooner
had
i
found
a
secluded
place
than
my
old
friend
appeared
and
joined
me
dirtier
and
more
hideous
and
if
possible
more
deformed
than
ever
yes
said
maria
dolores
with
interest
as
he
paused
when
we
came
out
of
church
i
asked
annunziata
who
he
was
continued
john
and
she
said
that
though
she
had
kept
her
eyes
open
according
to
my
injunction
she
had
failed
to
see
any
one
kneeling
beside
me
that
on
the
contrary
she
had
seen
me
he
concluded
with
an
insouciance
that
was
plainly
assumed
for
its
dramatic
value
kneeling
alone
at
a
distance
from
every
one
maria
dolores
face
was
white
she
frowned
her
mystification
what
she
exclaimed
in
a
voice
that
is
precisely
the
ejaculation
that
fell
from
my
own
lips
at
the
time
said
john
then
i
gave
her
a
minute
description
of
the
old
man
in
all
his
ugliness
and
then
she
administered
my
lesson
to
me
yes
what
was
it
questioned
maria
dolores
her
interest
acute
speaking
in
that
oracular
vein
of
hers
her
eyes
very
big
her
face
very
grave
she
assured
me
that
my
horrible
old
man
had
no
objective
existence
she
informed
me
cheerfully
and
calmly
that
he
was
an
image
of
my
own
soul
as
it
appeared
corrupted
and
aged
and
deformed
by
the
sins
of
a
lifetime
to
god
and
to
the
saints
and
she
added
that
he
was
sent
to
punish
me
for
my
pride
in
thinking
myself
different
to
the
common
people
and
in
seeking
to
hold
myself
aloof
since
then
john
brought
his
anecdote
to
a
term
i
have
always
knelt
in
the
body
of
the
church
and
i
have
never
again
seen
my
doppelg√§nger
maria
dolores
was
silent
for
a
little
they
had
come
to
the
southern
end
of
the
cloisters
where
the
buttresses
of
the
castle
walls
all
in
a
green
overgrowth
of
creepers
fall
precipitously
away
down
the
steep
face
of
a
natural
cliff
they
stopped
here
and
stood
looking
off
the
rain
had
held
up
though
the
valley
was
still
misty
with
its
vapours
whiffs
of
velvety
air
warm
and
sweet
blew
in
their
faces
lightly
stirred
the
dark
hair
about
her
brow
and
catching
the
flowery
edge
of
her
black
lace
mantilla
set
it
fluttering
that
is
a
very
good
story
she
said
with
a
sober
glance
behind
which
there
was
the
glint
of
laughter
in
view
of
it
however
i
suppose
there
will
be
no
use
in
my
delivering
a
message
i
am
charged
with
for
you
from
my
friend
frau
brandt
oh
questioned
john
what
message
frau
brandt
has
received
from
the
owner
of
the
castle
the
privilege
of
hearing
mass
from
the
tribune
and
she
wished
me
to
invite
you
in
her
name
hereafter
to
hear
mass
from
there
with
us
but
i
suppose
in
view
of
your
that
is
an
invitation
which
you
will
decline
the
glint
of
laughter
shone
brighter
in
her
eyes
and
her
mouth
had
a
tiny
pucker
amiably
derisive
john
looked
at
her
his
blue
eyes
bold
that
is
an
invitation
which
i
am
terribly
tempted
to
accept
he
said
in
a
voice
of
unconcealed
emotion
of
patent
meaning
and
beneath
his
bold
gaze
her
dark
eyes
dropped
while
i
think
a
blush
faintly
swept
her
cheeks
and
first
of
all
he
added
pray
express
to
frau
brandt
my
grateful
thanks
for
it
and
let
me
thank
you
also
for
your
kindness
in
conveying
it
if
in
spite
of
my
temptation
i
accept
it
that
will
be
for
a
very
special
reason
and
one
quite
unconnected
with
my
maria
dolores
probably
knew
her
danger
she
turned
and
began
to
walk
backwards
towards
the
point
where
you
can
pass
from
the
cloisters
through
the
great
into
the
garden
and
so
on
to
the
pavilion
beyond
the
clock
she
probably
knew
her
danger
but
she
was
human
but
she
was
a
woman
besides
she
had
reached
the
and
thus
commanded
a
clear
means
of
escape
so
coming
to
a
standstill
here
what
is
the
very
special
reason
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
keeping
her
eyes
from
his
his
were
bolder
than
ever
infinite
admiration
of
her
burned
in
them
infinite
delight
in
her
desire
for
her
at
the
same
time
a
kind
of
angry
hopelessness
darkened
them
and
a
kind
of
bitter
amusement
as
of
one
amused
at
his
own
sad
plight
i
wish
i
were
rich
he
exclaimed
irritably
between
his
teeth
oh
is
the
very
special
reason
asked
she
with
two
notes
of
laughter
no
said
he
but
it
has
a
connection
with
it
you
see
i
in
love
yes
said
she
i
remember
your
telling
me
so
well
i
wish
i
were
rich
said
he
then
i
might
pluck
up
courage
to
ask
the
woman
i
love
to
be
my
wife
money
is
everything
here
below
said
she
i
have
your
own
word
for
that
what
else
counts
said
he
when
you
wish
to
ask
a
woman
to
marry
you
oh
many
things
said
she
difference
of
rank
for
example
that
would
count
with
me
said
the
democratic
fellow
handsomely
i
should
give
two
thoughts
to
differences
of
rank
maria
dolores
smiled
at
her
secret
reflections
i
suppose
but
poverty
puts
it
out
of
all
question
john
moodily
went
on
i
could
ask
a
woman
to
come
and
share
with
me
an
income
of
sixpence
a
week
especially
as
i
have
grounds
for
believing
that
she
in
rather
affluent
circumstances
herself
oh
i
wish
i
were
rich
he
repeated
this
aspiration
in
a
groan
poor
poor
young
man
she
commiserated
him
while
her
eyes
which
she
held
perseveringly
averted
were
soft
with
sympathy
and
gay
with
mirth
when
do
you
begin
your
gardening
oh
do
mock
me
he
cried
with
an
imploring
gesture
you
know
joking
apart
that
it
child
play
for
a
man
of
my
age
with
no
profession
and
no
special
talent
to
fancy
he
can
turn
to
and
earn
money
i
might
if
i
made
supernatural
exertions
and
if
fortune
went
out
of
her
way
to
favour
me
add
a
maximum
of
another
sixpence
to
my
weekly
budget
no
there
never
a
hope
for
me
on
sea
or
land
i
must
bear
it
though
i
can
not
grin
withal
ah
well
said
maria
dolores
to
comfort
him
these
attacks
i
have
read
are
often
as
short
as
they
are
sharp
let
us
trust
you
soon
rally
from
this
one
how
long
have
they
generally
lasted
in
the
past
john
face
grew
dark
with
upbraiding
the
of
his
eyes
the
gold
of
his
hair
and
beard
the
pink
of
his
complexion
visibly
grew
dark
you
are
so
needlessly
unkind
he
said
that
you
do
deserve
to
hear
the
true
answer
to
your
question
she
studied
the
fresco
on
the
wall
beside
her
all
the
same
said
he
you
hear
it
if
falling
in
love
were
my
habit
no
doubt
i
should
take
it
so
hard
but
the
simple
truth
though
i
am
thirty
years
old
is
that
i
have
never
before
felt
so
much
as
a
for
any
woman
and
since
you
cite
your
reading
have
read
that
a
fire
which
may
merely
singe
the
surface
of
green
wood
will
entirely
consume
the
dry
she
continued
to
study
the
ancient
painting
her
fingers
were
playing
with
the
ends
of
her
lace
veil
besides
he
went
on
if
i
had
been
in
love
a
dozen
times
it
signify
for
i
should
have
been
in
love
with
ordinary
usual
human
women
they
the
only
sort
i
ever
met
till
i
met
her
she
of
a
totally
different
order
as
distinct
from
them
as
what
shall
i
say
oh
as
unlike
them
as
starfire
is
unlike
dull
clay
starfire
starfire
the
wonderful
high
starfire
of
her
spirit
that
the
thing
that
strikes
you
most
in
her
it
shines
through
her
it
shines
in
her
eyes
it
shines
in
her
hair
her
adorable
soft
dark
warm
and
fragrant
hair
it
shines
in
her
very
voice
it
shines
in
every
word
she
utters
even
in
the
unkindest
dear
me
what
an
alarmingly
refulgent
person
you
depict
laughed
maria
dolores
her
eyes
still
on
the
wall
i
have
no
gift
for
said
john
though
i
doubt
if
the
words
are
yet
invented
that
could
fitly
paint
my
lady
she
grows
in
beauty
day
by
day
it
a
literal
fact
every
fresh
time
i
see
her
she
is
perceptibly
more
lovely
than
the
last
more
in
her
loveliness
but
is
a
thing
unpaintable
indescribable
as
indescribable
as
the
perfume
of
a
rose
oh
why
have
i
five
thousand
a
year
you
harp
so
persistently
upon
your
desire
for
money
suggested
maria
dolores
one
might
infer
she
was
a
commodity
to
be
bought
and
sold
you
begin
at
the
wrong
end
what
good
would
five
or
fifty
thousand
a
year
do
you
if
you
had
not
begun
by
winning
her
love
no
i
begin
at
the
proper
end
worse
luck
john
answered
glooming
for
without
a
decent
income
i
have
no
right
even
to
try
to
win
her
love
and
that
being
so
questioned
maria
dolores
i
hope
you
conscientiously
avoid
her
society
or
when
you
meet
make
yourself
consistently
disagreeable
to
her
there
no
need
for
such
precautions
john
replied
there
no
fear
for
her
she
regards
me
as
a
casual
and
passing
acquaintance
so
i
make
myself
no
more
disagreeable
than
i
am
by
nature
and
if
i
avoided
her
society
which
i
am
far
from
doing
it
would
be
not
for
her
sake
but
for
my
own
for
though
her
society
is
to
me
a
kind
of
anticipation
of
the
joys
of
heaven
yet
when
i
leave
it
and
find
myself
alone
the
reaction
is
dreary
in
the
superlative
degree
and
the
fear
which
perpetually
haunts
me
for
i
know
nothing
of
her
plans
lest
i
shall
never
see
her
again
is
agonizing
as
a
foretaste
of
heaven
antipode
oh
i
love
her
he
took
involuntarily
i
dare
say
a
step
in
her
direction
she
retreated
under
the
vaulting
of
the
you
seem
she
commented
to
be
getting
a
good
deal
of
emotional
experience
which
doubtless
some
day
you
will
find
of
value
why
not
instead
of
gardener
embark
as
novelist
or
poet
here
is
material
you
could
then
turn
to
account
ah
there
you
are
he
complained
piteously
mocking
me
again
ah
well
if
you
must
have
your
laugh
have
it
and
welcome
a
man
can
learn
to
take
the
bitter
with
the
sweet
to
spare
you
that
discomfort
said
she
moving
deeper
into
the
archway
while
john
face
fell
i
will
bid
you
i
am
to
report
then
that
you
decline
my
friend
invitation
with
thanks
with
my
most
grateful
thanks
he
was
able
intensively
to
rejoin
in
spite
of
his
dismay
at
the
imminence
of
her
departure
and
for
a
very
special
reason
she
harked
back
now
suddenly
for
the
first
time
since
they
had
touched
thin
ice
giving
him
a
glance
it
was
the
fleetingest
of
fleeting
glances
it
was
merry
and
ironic
but
there
was
something
in
it
which
brought
a
flame
to
his
blue
eyes
for
the
very
special
reason
he
answered
with
vehemence
that
i
fear
the
presence
near
me
of
he
held
his
breath
for
a
second
the
flame
in
his
eyes
enveloping
her
then
with
an
abrupt
change
of
tone
and
mien
he
ended
of
frau
brandt
might
distract
my
attention
from
the
sermon
she
laughed
and
said
said
john
and
when
she
was
halfway
through
the
passage
i
suppose
you
know
you
are
leaving
me
to
a
day
as
barren
as
the
desert
of
sahara
he
called
after
her
oh
who
can
tell
what
a
day
may
bring
forth
called
she
but
without
looking
back
for
a
long
while
john
faculties
were
kept
busy
trying
to
determine
whether
that
was
a
promise
a
menace
or
a
mere
word
in
the
air
iii
rain
before
seven
clear
before
eleven
is
as
true
or
as
untrue
in
lombardy
as
it
is
in
other
parts
of
the
world
the
rain
had
held
up
and
now
in
that
spirited
phrase
of
corvo
here
came
my
lord
the
sun
splendidly
putting
the
clouds
to
flight
or
chaining
them
transfigured
to
his
clothing
the
high
in
a
roseate
glory
that
seemed
somehow
i
do
know
why
to
accent
their
solitude
and
their
remoteness
flooding
the
valley
with
ethereal
amber
turning
the
swollen
rampio
to
a
river
of
fire
while
the
nearer
hillsides
the
olive
woods
the
trees
in
the
castle
garden
glistened
with
a
million
million
crystals
and
the
petals
of
the
flowers
were
while
the
breath
of
the
earth
rose
in
long
streamers
of
luminous
incense
and
the
sky
gleamed
with
every
tender
every
brilliant
tint
of
blue
from
the
blue
of
pale
forgetmenots
to
the
blue
of
larkspur
john
contemplating
this
spectacle
and
thinking
of
maria
dolores
revolving
still
her
cryptic
valediction
all
at
once
as
his
eye
rested
on
the
shimmer
at
the
valley
end
which
he
knew
to
be
the
lake
lifted
up
his
hand
and
clapped
his
brow
by
jove
he
muttered
if
i
was
within
an
ace
of
clean
forgetting
the
sight
of
the
lake
had
fortunately
put
him
in
mind
that
he
was
engaged
to
lunch
with
lady
blanchemain
at
roccadoro
he
found
her
ladyship
in
a
frock
all
concentric
whirls
of
crisp
white
ruffles
vigorously
wielding
a
fan
and
complaining
of
the
heat
indeed
as
annunziata
had
predicted
it
had
grown
markedly
warmer
i
shall
fly
away
if
this
continues
i
shall
fly
straight
to
town
and
set
my
house
in
order
for
the
season
when
do
come
she
asked
smiling
on
him
from
her
benign
old
eyes
i
do
come
answered
john
i
rather
like
town
in
autumn
and
winter
when
it
too
dark
to
see
its
ugliness
but
save
me
from
it
in
the
clear
light
of
summer
fudge
said
lady
blanchemain
london
the
most
beautiful
capital
in
europe
it
grandiose
and
it
the
only
place
where
there
are
any
people
yes
said
john
but
as
at
nice
and
homburg
too
many
of
them
are
english
and
there
a
liberal
scattering
i
heard
of
jews
oh
jews
are
all
right
when
they
are
jewy
said
lady
blanchemain
with
magnanimity
i
know
some
very
nice
ones
i
was
rather
hoping
you
would
be
a
feature
of
my
sunday
afternoons
i
not
a
society
man
said
john
i
no
aptitude
myself
for
patronizing
or
toadying
and
i
do
particularly
enjoy
being
patronized
or
toadied
to
is
that
the
beginning
and
end
of
social
life
in
england
lady
blanchemain
inquired
delicately
sarcastic
as
i
have
seen
it
yes
asseverated
john
the
beginning
end
and
middle
of
social
life
in
england
as
in
is
worship
of
the
longest
pigtail
a
fetichism
sometimes
grosser
sometimes
subtler
sometimes
deliberate
often
unconscious
and
instinctive
every
one
you
meet
is
aware
that
his
pigtail
is
either
longer
or
shorter
than
yours
and
accordingly
more
or
less
subtly
grossly
unconsciously
or
deliberately
swaggers
or
bends
the
knee
it
a
state
of
things
tried
in
vain
to
find
diverting
it
a
state
of
things
you
find
prevailing
pretty
well
in
all
places
where
the
human
species
breeds
said
lady
blanchemain
the
only
difference
will
be
a
question
of
what
constitutes
the
pigtail
and
are
you
then
remaining
at
sant
alessina
for
the
present
answered
john
until
she
questioned
oh
well
until
she
sends
me
away
or
leaves
herself
said
he
and
so
my
fool
paradise
achieves
its
inevitable
end
lady
blanchemain
laughed
a
long
quiet
laugh
of
amused
contentment
come
in
to
luncheon
she
said
putting
her
soft
white
hand
upon
his
arm
and
tell
me
all
about
it
and
when
they
were
established
at
her
table
a
round
table
gay
with
flowers
in
a
window
at
the
far
end
of
the
cool
of
the
hotel
victoria
why
do
you
call
it
a
fool
paradise
she
asked
well
you
see
i
in
love
said
he
you
really
are
she
doubted
with
sprightliness
looking
gleeful
all
too
really
he
assured
her
in
a
sinking
voice
what
an
old
witch
i
was
mused
she
with
satisfaction
accept
my
felicitations
she
beamed
upon
him
i
should
prefer
your
condolences
said
he
in
a
voice
from
the
depths
donc
cheer
up
laughed
she
dallying
with
her
bliss
men
have
died
and
worms
have
eaten
them
but
not
for
love
i
wonder
said
john
that
is
a
statement
it
seems
to
me
which
would
be
the
better
for
some
proving
at
all
events
said
she
you
for
one
are
not
dead
yet
no
admitted
he
though
i
could
almost
wish
i
was
do
you
mean
to
say
she
has
definitely
rejected
you
she
demanded
alarmed
fortune
has
spared
her
that
necessity
said
john
i
have
asked
her
and
i
never
shall
i
have
any
money
pooh
is
that
all
scoffed
her
ladyship
relieved
you
have
prospects
remote
ones
the
remoter
the
better
i
wo
count
on
dead
shoes
said
john
what
is
it
your
little
at
the
castle
calls
you
asked
lady
blanchemain
shrewdly
her
dark
old
eyebrows
up
she
calls
me
a
non
was
john
quick
riposte
and
the
lady
laughed
but
in
a
moment
she
pulled
a
straight
face
i
seriously
counsel
you
to
have
more
faith
she
said
go
home
and
ask
her
to
marry
you
and
if
she
accepts
you
see
money
will
come
besides
your
rank
and
your
prospective
rank
are
assets
which
you
err
in
not
adding
to
the
balance
go
home
and
propose
to
her
do
no
good
said
john
dejectedly
she
regards
me
with
imperturbable
indifference
i
made
the
fieriest
avowals
to
her
and
she
never
turned
a
hair
lady
blanchemain
looked
bewildered
you
made
avowals
she
falteringly
echoed
i
should
rather
think
so
john
affirmed
indirect
ones
of
course
and
i
hope
inoffensive
but
fiery
as
live
coals
in
the
third
person
you
know
i
given
her
two
and
two
she
has
you
may
be
sure
enough
skill
in
mathematics
to
put
together
and
she
never
turned
a
hair
the
lady
marvelled
she
jeered
at
me
she
mocked
me
she
laughed
and
rode
away
said
he
she
probably
in
love
with
you
said
lady
blanchemain
if
a
woman
will
listen
if
a
woman
will
laugh
if
you
do
propose
to
her
now
having
ensnared
her
young
affections
you
be
something
worse
than
the
wicked
nobleman
of
song
and
story
oh
well
john
responded
conciliatory
i
dare
say
some
of
these
days
a
proposal
will
slip
out
when
i
least
intend
it
so
i
shall
have
done
the
honourable
thing
and
i
sure
i
can
trust
her
to
play
fair
and
say
me
nay
lady
blanchemain
slowly
shook
her
head
i
glad
you
not
lover
she
devoutly
murmured
plying
her
fan
oh
but
i
am
cried
john
with
a
bow
and
an
admiring
flash
of
the
eyes
her
soft
old
face
lighted
up
then
it
took
on
an
expression
of
resolution
and
she
set
her
strong
old
jaws
in
that
case
she
remarked
you
will
have
the
less
reluctance
in
granting
a
favour
i
about
to
ask
you
what
the
favour
said
john
in
a
tone
of
readiness
i
want
you
to
buy
a
pig
in
a
poke
said
she
oh
questioned
he
yes
said
she
i
want
you
to
make
me
a
promise
blindfold
i
want
you
to
promise
in
the
dark
that
you
will
do
something
what
it
is
that
you
to
do
you
not
to
know
till
the
time
comes
will
you
promise
dearest
lady
said
the
trustful
young
man
i
perfectly
confident
that
you
would
never
ask
me
to
do
anything
that
i
could
do
with
profit
to
myself
buy
a
pig
in
a
poke
from
you
without
a
hesitation
of
course
i
promise
bravo
bravo
applauded
lady
blanchemain
glowing
at
her
easy
triumph
in
a
few
days
you
receive
a
letter
that
will
tell
you
what
it
is
you
pledged
to
and
now
to
reward
you
come
with
me
to
my
and
i
will
make
you
a
little
present
when
they
had
reached
her
dim
and
cool
with
its
blinds
and
the
linen
covers
of
its
furniture
she
put
into
his
hands
a
small
case
of
shagreen
small
and
hard
and
at
the
edges
white
with
age
go
to
the
window
and
see
what
in
it
she
said
and
obeying
by
jove
what
a
stunner
he
exclaimed
the
case
contained
a
ring
a
light
circle
of
gold
set
with
a
ruby
surrounded
by
a
row
of
diamonds
for
my
part
i
think
the
most
beautiful
ruby
i
have
ever
seen
it
was
as
big
as
a
or
almost
it
was
cut
with
innumerable
facets
in
the
shape
of
a
heart
and
it
quivered
and
burned
and
flowed
and
rippled
liquidly
with
the
purest
limpidest
red
fire
is
the
spirit
of
a
rose
distilled
and
crystallized
said
lady
blanchemain
is
a
drop
of
liquid
light
said
john
but
why
do
you
give
it
to
me
i
ca
wear
it
i
do
think
i
ought
to
accept
it
nobody
asks
you
to
wear
it
said
lady
blanchemain
it
a
ring
of
course
but
as
for
accepting
it
you
need
have
no
scruples
it
an
old
blanchemain
gem
that
was
in
the
family
a
hundred
years
before
i
came
into
it
it
properly
an
heirloom
and
you
the
heir
i
give
it
to
you
for
a
purpose
should
you
ever
become
engaged
i
desire
you
to
placcit
upon
the
finger
of
the
adventurous
woman
iv
under
a
gnarled
old
olive
by
the
river
brim
annunziata
sat
on
the
turf
head
bowed
so
that
her
curls
fell
in
a
tangle
all
about
her
cheeks
and
gazed
fixedly
into
the
green
waters
the
laughing
dancing
purling
waters
green
and
where
the
sun
reached
them
shot
with
seams
and
cleavages
of
light
like
fluorspar
in
the
grass
near
by
violets
tried
to
hide
themselves
but
were
betrayed
by
their
truant
sweetness
the
waters
purled
a
light
breeze
rustled
the
and
birds
were
singing
loud
and
wild
as
birds
will
after
rain
maria
dolores
coming
down
the
path
that
followed
the
river
windings
stood
for
a
minute
and
watched
her
small
friend
without
speaking
but
at
last
she
called
out
annunziata
are
you
dreaming
dreams
and
seeing
visions
annunziata
started
and
looked
up
she
whispered
with
an
admonitory
gesture
she
stole
a
wary
glance
roundabout
and
then
spoke
as
one
fearful
of
being
overheard
i
was
listening
to
the
music
of
divopan
she
said
maria
dolores
who
had
come
closer
appeared
at
a
loss
the
music
of
what
she
questioned
whispered
annunziata
i
would
not
dare
to
say
it
aloud
the
music
of
divopan
divopan
maria
dolores
puzzled
compliantly
guarding
her
tone
what
is
that
divo
pan
said
annunziata
dividing
the
word
in
two
and
always
with
an
air
of
excessive
caution
but
maria
dolores
helplessly
shook
her
head
i
afraid
i
understand
what
is
divo
pan
do
you
know
what
a
is
asked
annunziata
her
clear
grey
eyes
surprised
oh
a
said
maria
dolores
getting
a
glimmer
of
light
ah
yes
a
divo
is
a
saint
i
think
not
exactly
annunziata
discriminated
but
something
like
one
the
saints
you
see
are
always
very
good
and
are
sometimes
bad
but
they
are
powerful
like
saints
they
can
do
anything
they
wish
divo
pan
is
the
divo
who
makes
all
the
music
that
you
hear
out
of
doors
the
music
of
the
wind
and
the
water
and
the
but
you
must
be
careful
never
to
praise
his
music
aloud
lest
divo
apollone
should
hear
you
he
is
the
divo
that
makes
all
the
music
you
hear
on
instruments
on
harps
and
violins
and
pianos
he
is
very
jealous
of
divo
pan
and
if
he
hears
you
praising
him
will
do
something
to
you
you
know
what
he
did
to
king
mida
do
you
what
did
he
do
asked
maria
dolores
annunziata
stole
another
wary
glance
about
once
upon
a
time
she
recounted
always
in
her
lowest
voice
many
years
ago
hundreds
of
years
ago
the
king
of
this
country
was
named
mida
and
he
loved
very
much
the
music
of
divo
pan
he
loved
to
sit
by
the
river
here
and
to
listen
to
the
music
of
the
water
and
of
the
leaves
and
of
the
birds
i
love
to
do
it
too
and
i
think
he
was
quite
right
but
one
day
in
his
house
there
came
a
musician
with
a
harp
and
began
to
play
to
him
and
the
king
listened
for
a
while
and
then
he
told
the
musician
to
stop
music
is
very
good
he
said
now
i
am
going
into
the
fields
and
by
the
river
where
i
can
hear
a
music
i
like
better
but
the
musician
with
the
harp
was
really
divo
apollone
himself
disguised
and
this
made
him
very
angry
and
jealous
and
to
punish
king
mida
he
changed
his
ears
to
long
hairy
ears
like
an
ass
so
if
you
love
the
music
of
divo
pan
you
must
be
very
careful
not
to
let
divo
apollone
hear
you
praise
it
or
he
will
do
something
to
you
and
to
drive
home
this
application
of
her
theme
she
held
up
a
warning
finger
maria
dolores
had
listened
smiling
now
she
gave
a
gay
little
laugh
and
then
for
a
moment
mused
that
is
a
very
curious
bit
of
history
she
said
in
the
end
how
ever
did
it
come
to
your
knowledge
annunziata
shrugged
oh
she
answered
everybody
knows
that
i
have
known
it
for
years
my
grandmother
who
lived
in
milan
told
it
to
me
does
the
water
look
cool
and
pleasant
was
her
abrupt
digression
as
she
returned
her
gaze
to
the
rampio
when
it
is
hot
like
this
i
should
like
to
lie
down
in
the
water
and
go
to
sleep
would
you
i
not
so
sure
said
maria
dolores
i
should
rather
fear
i
might
be
drowned
oh
but
that
would
hurt
said
annunziata
with
security
to
be
drowned
in
such
beautiful
green
water
among
all
those
beams
of
light
would
be
nice
perhaps
you
are
not
aware
said
maria
dolores
that
when
people
are
drowned
they
die
oh
yes
i
know
that
said
annunziata
but
she
raised
calm
pellucid
eyes
would
you
like
to
die
certainly
not
said
maria
dolores
a
shadow
on
her
face
i
would
said
annunziata
stoutly
it
must
be
lovely
to
die
hush
maria
dolores
rebuked
her
frowning
you
must
not
say
such
things
why
not
say
them
if
you
think
them
asked
annunziata
you
must
think
them
either
said
maria
dolores
oh
i
ca
help
thinking
them
said
annunziata
with
a
movement
it
surely
must
be
lovely
to
die
and
go
to
heaven
if
i
were
perfectly
sure
i
should
go
to
heaven
i
would
shut
my
eyes
and
die
now
but
i
should
probably
have
to
wait
some
time
in
purgatory
and
of
course
i
might
go
to
hell
maria
dolores
face
was
full
of
trouble
you
must
not
talk
like
that
she
said
you
must
not
it
is
wicked
of
you
then
if
i
am
wicked
i
go
to
hell
inquired
annunziata
looking
alertly
up
maria
dolores
looked
about
her
looked
across
the
river
down
the
valley
as
one
in
distress
scanning
the
prospect
for
aid
of
course
you
would
not
she
said
my
dear
child
ca
we
find
something
else
to
talk
of
do
you
think
i
shall
have
a
very
long
and
hard
purgatory
asked
annunziata
maria
dolores
threw
a
despairing
glance
at
the
horizon
no
no
dear
she
answered
uneasily
you
will
have
a
very
short
and
gentle
one
anyhow
you
not
have
to
consider
that
for
years
to
come
now
shall
we
change
the
subject
well
said
annunziata
with
an
air
of
deliberation
if
you
are
perfectly
sure
i
shall
not
go
to
hell
and
that
my
purgatory
will
not
be
long
and
hard
i
think
i
will
do
what
i
said
i
will
lie
down
in
the
water
and
go
to
sleep
and
the
water
will
drown
me
and
i
shall
die
maria
dolores
face
was
terrified
annunziata
she
cried
you
know
what
you
are
saying
you
are
cruel
you
wo
do
anything
of
the
sort
you
must
give
me
your
solemn
word
of
honour
that
you
wo
do
anything
of
the
sort
it
would
be
a
most
dreadful
sin
come
come
with
me
now
away
from
here
away
from
the
sight
of
the
river
you
must
never
come
here
alone
again
give
me
your
hand
and
come
away
annunziata
got
up
gave
her
hand
and
moved
off
at
maria
dolores
side
towards
the
castle
of
course
she
said
if
i
want
to
die
i
need
to
lie
down
in
the
water
i
can
die
at
any
moment
i
wish
by
just
shutting
my
eyes
and
holding
my
breath
and
telling
my
heart
seven
times
to
stop
beating
heart
stop
beating
heart
stop
beating
that
way
seven
times
for
the
love
of
mercy
wailed
poor
maria
dolores
almost
writhing
in
her
misery
then
suddenly
she
breathed
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
and
fervently
exclaimed
thank
god
john
was
advancing
towards
them
down
the
rugged
pathway
do
please
come
and
help
me
with
this
perverse
and
maddening
child
she
called
to
him
in
english
she
frightening
me
half
out
of
my
wits
by
threatening
to
die
she
even
threatened
to
drown
herself
in
the
rampio
children
of
her
complexion
ca
die
said
john
in
italian
and
annunziata
pricked
up
her
ears
they
can
only
turn
into
monkeys
and
then
they
have
to
live
in
the
forests
of
africa
where
it
is
always
dark
and
all
the
men
and
women
are
negro
savages
and
all
the
other
animals
except
the
mosquitos
and
the
snakes
are
lions
and
tigers
besides
if
annunziata
were
to
turn
into
a
monkey
she
could
have
the
sugared
chestnuts
that
somebody
or
other
has
brought
her
from
roccadoro
on
the
chest
of
drawers
in
my
room
there
has
mysteriously
appeared
a
box
of
sugared
chestnuts
i
thought
they
were
for
her
but
they
not
unless
she
will
promise
never
to
turn
into
a
monkey
annunziata
eyes
had
clouded
of
course
i
wo
turn
into
a
monkey
she
said
in
accents
at
once
of
disillusion
and
disdain
i
did
not
know
there
was
any
such
danger
i
should
hate
to
be
a
monkey
then
her
eyes
brightened
again
may
i
go
and
get
them
now
she
asked
wistful
and
impatient
yes
said
john
be
off
with
you
and
she
went
running
lightly
up
the
hill
he
turned
to
maria
dolores
her
face
with
its
dark
hair
against
the
red
background
of
her
sunshade
was
white
and
drawn
with
pain
but
she
smiled
rather
wanly
as
her
gaze
met
his
and
said
in
a
weak
voice
oh
i
am
so
glad
you
came
i
ca
tell
you
how
she
was
frightening
me
and
all
at
once
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
i
need
say
whether
john
was
moved
whether
it
was
his
impulse
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
dry
her
tears
with
kisses
he
did
actually
on
that
impulse
give
a
perceptible
start
towards
her
but
then
he
restrained
himself
the
child
ought
to
be
whipped
he
broke
out
angrily
you
must
not
take
her
prattle
so
seriously
but
was
so
serious
said
maria
dolores
oh
when
she
threatened
to
lie
down
in
the
river
and
let
herself
be
drowned
her
voice
failed
her
as
at
the
inexpressible
no
fear
of
that
said
john
the
first
touch
of
the
cold
water
and
it
is
a
you
know
would
bring
her
to
her
senses
but
come
you
must
not
think
of
it
any
more
you
have
had
a
bad
shock
but
no
bones
are
broken
and
now
you
must
try
to
banish
it
all
from
your
mind
what
an
unaccountable
child
she
is
said
maria
dolores
surely
it
is
unnatural
and
alarming
for
a
child
to
have
her
head
so
teeming
with
strange
freaks
and
fancies
oh
i
pray
god
to
grant
that
nothing
may
happen
to
her
the
most
serious
evil
that
likely
to
happen
to
her
for
the
present
said
john
will
be
an
indigestion
of
marrons
glac√©s
maria
dolores
tears
had
gone
now
she
smiled
but
afterwards
she
looked
grave
again
oh
i
wish
i
could
get
the
dread
of
something
happening
to
her
out
of
my
heart
i
wish
she
was
so
pale
and
she
said
then
there
came
a
gleam
in
her
eyes
but
you
were
going
for
a
walk
and
i
am
detaining
you
the
object
of
my
walk
has
been
accomplished
said
john
oh
questioned
she
i
was
walking
in
the
hope
on
the
chance
that
i
might
meet
you
he
hardily
explained
it
such
an
age
since
i
seen
you
are
you
making
for
the
garden
i
pray
you
to
be
kind
and
let
me
go
with
you
i
been
an
exile
and
a
wanderer
i
been
to
roccadoro
she
had
rebegun
her
ascension
of
the
hill
the
path
was
steep
as
well
as
rugged
sometimes
john
had
to
help
her
over
a
hard
bit
the
touch
of
her
hand
soft
and
warm
and
firm
too
in
his
the
sense
of
her
closeness
the
faint
fragrance
of
her
garments
of
her
hair
these
things
you
may
be
sure
went
to
his
head
went
to
his
heart
the
garden
lay
in
a
white
blaze
of
sunshine
that
seemed
almost
material
like
an
incandescent
fluid
but
the
entrance
to
the
avenue
was
dark
and
inviting
let
us
he
proposed
go
and
sit
on
a
marble
bench
under
the
glossy
leaves
of
the
ilexes
in
the
deep
cool
shade
and
let
play
that
it
a
thousand
years
ago
and
that
you
a
queen
white
queen
blanche
like
a
queen
of
lilies
and
that
i
your
what
song
will
you
sing
me
asked
she
gaily
as
they
took
their
places
on
the
marble
bench
it
was
semicircular
with
a
high
carved
back
carved
with
the
armorials
of
the
sforzas
and
of
course
it
was
grey
and
blue
and
green
yellow
and
scarlet
queen
blanche
like
a
queen
of
lilies
fairer
and
dearer
than
dearest
and
fairest
to
hear
me
sing
if
it
her
sweet
will
is
sing
of
thy
love
an
thou
trolled
john
in
his
light
barytone
to
a
tune
i
imagine
improvised
for
the
occasion
but
if
it
a
thousand
years
ago
he
laughed
that
song
smacks
too
much
perhaps
of
actuality
and
i
had
best
choose
another
maria
dolores
joined
in
his
laugh
i
did
not
know
you
sang
she
said
let
me
hear
the
other
a
song
reflected
he
that
i
could
sing
with
a
good
deal
of
feeling
and
conviction
would
be
her
but
the
least
excuse
to
love
me
maria
dolores
all
at
once
looked
sober
ought
you
to
be
careful
she
said
to
give
her
no
excuse
at
all
to
love
you
if
you
are
really
resolved
never
to
ask
her
to
be
your
wife
that
is
exactly
what
i
have
given
her
answered
john
no
excuse
at
all
i
should
sing
in
a
spirit
purely
academic
my
song
would
be
the
utterance
of
a
pious
but
hopeless
longing
of
the
moth
desire
for
the
star
but
she
i
suppose
is
a
star
objected
maria
dolores
probably
just
a
weak
human
woman
you
may
have
given
her
excuses
without
meaning
to
there
was
the
slightest
quaver
in
her
voice
john
caught
his
breath
he
turned
upon
her
almost
violently
but
she
was
facing
away
from
him
down
the
avenue
so
that
he
could
not
get
her
eyes
in
that
case
she
said
would
you
owe
her
something
i
should
owe
myself
a
lifetime
penance
with
the
discipline
john
on
a
solemn
tone
replied
hungrily
looking
at
her
cheek
at
the
little
tendrils
of
dark
hair
about
her
brow
god
knows
what
i
should
owe
to
her
you
would
owe
it
to
her
said
maria
dolores
always
facing
away
to
tell
her
your
love
straightforwardly
and
to
ask
her
to
marry
you
john
thrilled
john
ached
his
blue
eyes
burned
upon
her
what
else
do
you
think
i
dream
of
night
and
day
but
how
could
i
with
honour
you
know
my
poverty
he
groaned
but
if
she
has
enough
more
than
enough
for
two
softly
urged
maria
dolores
ah
that
the
worst
of
it
cried
he
if
we
were
equals
in
penury
if
she
had
nothing
then
i
might
honourably
ask
her
and
we
could
live
on
herbs
together
in
a
garret
and
i
could
keep
her
respect
and
my
own
oh
but
to
marry
a
woman
who
is
rich
to
live
in
luxury
with
her
and
to
try
to
look
unconscious
while
she
pays
the
bills
she
would
despise
me
i
should
abhor
myself
why
should
she
despise
you
asked
maria
dolores
the
possession
of
wealth
is
a
mere
accident
if
people
are
married
and
love
each
other
i
ca
see
that
it
matters
an
atom
whether
their
money
belonged
in
the
first
place
to
the
man
or
to
the
woman
it
would
belong
henceforward
to
them
both
equally
that
is
a
very
generous
way
of
looking
at
it
but
it
is
a
woman
way
no
decent
man
could
accept
it
said
john
up
to
a
certain
point
said
maria
dolores
slowly
i
understand
your
scruples
i
understand
that
a
poor
man
might
feel
that
he
would
not
like
to
make
the
advances
if
the
woman
he
loved
was
rich
but
suppose
the
woman
loved
him
and
knew
that
he
loved
her
and
knew
that
it
was
only
his
poverty
which
held
him
back
then
might
make
the
advances
she
might
put
aside
her
pride
and
go
halfway
to
meet
him
and
to
remove
his
difficulties
and
embarrassments
if
after
that
he
still
did
not
ask
her
i
think
his
scruples
would
have
become
mere
vanity
i
think
it
would
show
that
he
cared
more
for
his
mere
vanity
than
for
her
happiness
her
voice
died
out
john
could
see
that
her
lip
quivered
a
little
his
throat
was
dry
the
pulses
were
pounding
in
his
temples
his
brain
was
all
a
confusion
he
hardly
knew
what
had
befallen
him
he
hardly
knew
what
she
had
said
he
only
knew
that
there
was
a
great
ball
of
fire
in
his
breast
and
that
the
pain
of
it
was
half
an
immeasurable
joy
god
forgive
me
the
absurd
and
exaggerated
stickler
for
the
dignity
of
his
sex
wildly
cried
god
knows
how
i
love
her
how
i
care
for
her
happiness
but
to
go
to
her
but
to
put
myself
in
the
position
of
being
kept
by
a
woman
god
knows
how
impossible
it
is
maria
dolores
stood
up
still
looking
away
from
him
well
let
us
hope
she
said
changing
her
tone
to
one
of
unconcerned
detachment
that
we
have
been
discussing
baseless
suppositions
let
us
hope
that
her
heart
is
quite
untouched
and
for
both
your
sakes
she
concluded
her
head
in
the
air
let
us
hope
that
you
and
she
will
never
meet
again
she
gave
him
a
curt
little
nod
and
walked
lightly
rapidly
up
the
avenue
john
brain
was
all
a
confusion
he
looked
after
her
helplessly
he
only
knew
that
there
was
a
great
ball
of
fire
in
his
breast
and
that
the
pain
of
it
was
now
unmixed
v
maria
dolores
tripped
into
frau
brandt
merrily
singing
a
snatch
of
song
vous
s√©v√®re
quand
on
vous
park
she
carolled
then
she
stopped
singing
and
blithely
laughed
frau
brandt
raised
her
good
brown
face
from
her
knitting
and
her
good
brown
eyes
looked
anxiously
upwards
slantwise
over
her
spectacles
what
is
the
matter
now
she
asked
what
has
happened
to
vex
you
now
to
vex
me
cried
maria
dolores
in
apparent
astonishment
was
i
singing
aloud
from
sheer
exuberance
of
high
spirits
no
said
frau
brandt
with
a
very
positive
shake
of
her
head
you
were
singing
to
conceal
your
low
spirits
what
has
happened
ah
well
then
if
you
know
so
much
and
must
know
all
said
maria
dolores
i
just
proposed
to
the
man
i
in
love
with
and
been
sent
about
my
business
what
do
you
mean
asked
frau
brandt
phlegmatic
what
nonsense
is
this
i
mean
my
cobbler
son
maria
dolores
answered
i
a
princess
of
the
empire
humbly
offered
him
a
cobbler
son
my
hand
heart
and
fortune
and
the
graceless
man
rejected
them
with
scorn
that
is
a
likely
story
said
frau
brandt
wagging
her
chin
her
blunt
brown
fingers
returned
to
their
occupation
i
see
your
serene
highness
offering
her
hand
at
all
events
will
you
kindly
tell
josephine
to
pack
our
boxes
we
be
flitting
her
serene
highness
in
a
casual
way
announced
what
say
you
cried
frau
brandt
dropping
her
knitting
into
her
lap
yes
to
mischenau
to
my
brother
the
princess
pursued
of
course
you
have
to
come
with
us
poor
dear
you
ca
let
me
travel
alone
with
josephine
no
said
frau
brandt
i
will
go
with
you
and
you
can
remain
for
my
wedding
maria
dolores
added
i
am
going
home
to
meet
my
brother
wishes
and
to
marry
my
second
cousin
the
high
and
mighty
maximilian
prince
of
herr
gott
said
frau
brandt
glancing
with
devotion
at
the
ceiling
vi
john
was
still
where
she
had
left
him
in
the
avenue
savouring
and
resavouring
his
woe
if
only
he
brooded
she
were
of
one
own
rank
in
the
world
then
her
wealth
might
perhaps
not
be
such
an
absolutely
hopeless
impediment
as
it
is
but
to
marry
as
they
say
beneath
one
and
to
marry
money
into
the
bargain
that
would
be
a
little
too
much
like
the
of
tradition
he
still
sat
where
she
had
left
him
on
the
marble
bench
disconsolate
when
the
parroco
approached
hurriedly
from
the
direction
of
the
house
signore
the
parroco
began
out
of
breath
i
offer
a
thousand
excuses
for
venturing
to
disturb
you
but
my
niece
has
suddenly
fallen
ill
i
am
going
to
the
village
to
telephone
for
a
doctor
my
cook
is
away
for
her
sunday
afternoon
might
i
pray
you
to
have
the
extreme
kindness
to
stay
with
the
child
till
i
return
i
do
know
what
is
the
matter
but
she
fainted
and
now
is
delirious
and
i
afraid
very
ill
indeed
good
heavens
gasped
john
forgetting
everything
else
of
course
of
course
and
he
set
off
hotfoot
for
the
presbytery
part
sixth
i
i
would
rather
not
dwell
upon
the
details
of
annunziata
illness
by
the
mercy
of
providence
she
got
well
in
the
end
but
in
the
mean
time
those
details
were
sufficiently
painful
john
for
example
found
it
more
than
painful
to
hear
her
cry
out
piteously
as
she
often
would
in
her
delirium
that
she
did
not
wish
to
be
turned
into
a
monkey
he
hung
his
head
and
groaned
and
cursed
the
malinspired
moment
which
had
given
that
chim√¶ra
birth
however
he
had
his
compensations
maria
dolores
whom
he
had
thought
never
to
see
again
he
saw
every
day
let
us
hope
that
you
and
she
may
never
meet
again
in
his
despairing
heart
the
words
became
a
refrain
but
an
hour
later
the
news
of
trouble
at
the
presbytery
had
travelled
to
the
pavilion
and
she
flew
straight
to
annunziata
bedside
ever
since
postponing
those
threatened
nuptials
at
mischenau
she
had
shared
with
john
and
the
parroco
and
marcella
the
cook
the
labours
of
nurse
and
though
it
was
arranged
that
the
men
turn
and
turn
about
should
watch
by
night
and
the
women
by
day
john
by
coming
early
and
leaving
late
contrived
to
make
a
good
part
of
his
vigil
and
of
hers
coincident
and
the
strange
result
is
that
now
looking
backwards
upon
that
period
of
pain
and
dread
when
from
minute
to
minute
no
one
knew
what
awful
change
the
next
minute
might
bring
looking
backwards
and
seeing
again
the
small
bare
room
with
its
whitewashed
walls
its
iron
cot
its
crucifix
its
narrow
window
through
which
wide
miles
of
valley
shone
and
then
the
little
white
face
and
the
brown
curls
tossing
on
the
pillow
and
the
woman
of
his
love
sitting
near
to
him
in
the
intimacy
of
a
common
care
and
common
duties
the
strange
result
is
that
john
feels
a
glow
in
his
heart
as
at
the
memory
of
a
period
of
joy
oh
do
not
let
them
turn
me
into
a
monkey
oh
holy
mother
i
am
so
afraid
oh
do
not
let
them
annunziata
cried
shuddering
and
shrinking
deeper
into
bed
towards
the
wall
john
hung
his
head
and
wrung
his
hands
my
god
my
god
he
groaned
you
should
not
blame
yourself
maria
dolores
said
in
a
low
voice
while
she
bathed
the
child
forehead
and
fanned
her
face
your
intention
was
good
you
could
not
foresee
what
has
happened
and
it
may
be
for
the
best
after
all
it
may
strengthen
her
to
live
which
is
the
great
thing
the
doctor
says
she
had
spoken
english
but
annunziata
next
outcry
was
like
a
response
oh
to
live
to
live
i
want
to
live
to
live
oh
let
me
live
but
at
other
times
her
wandering
thoughts
took
quite
a
different
turn
gazing
solemnly
up
into
maria
dolores
face
she
said
he
does
not
even
know
her
name
though
he
fears
it
may
be
smitti
i
thought
it
was
maria
dolores
but
he
fears
it
may
be
smitti
john
looked
out
of
the
window
pretending
not
to
hear
and
praying
i
expect
that
maria
dolores
eyes
might
be
blinded
and
her
counsel
darkened
at
the
same
time
heaven
having
sent
me
a
laughing
hero
i
wo
vouch
that
his
shoulders
did
shake
a
little
ii
apropos
of
their
ignorance
of
each
other
patronymics
one
afternoon
maria
dolores
was
taking
the
air
at
the
open
door
of
the
presbytery
when
to
a
mighty
clattering
of
horses
hoofs
a
big
barouche
came
sweeping
into
the
described
a
bold
and
abruptly
drew
up
before
her
in
the
barouche
sat
a
big
old
lady
a
big
soft
old
lady
in
cool
with
beautiful
white
hair
a
very
gay
light
straw
bonnet
and
a
much
befurbelowed
sunshade
coachman
and
footman
bolt
upright
stared
straight
before
them
as
rigid
as
if
their
liveries
were
of
the
horses
with
a
full
sense
of
what
they
owed
to
appearances
fierily
champed
their
bits
tossed
their
manes
and
pawed
the
the
old
lady
smiled
upon
maria
dolores
with
a
look
of
great
friendliness
and
interest
softly
bowed
and
wished
her
in
a
fine
warm
old
voice
good
afternoon
maria
dolores
feeling
an
instant
liking
as
well
as
curiosity
and
admiration
smiled
in
her
turn
and
responded
good
afternoon
you
enjoy
a
fine
view
from
here
the
old
lady
remarked
ducking
her
sunshade
in
the
direction
of
the
valley
a
beautiful
view
agreed
maria
dolores
following
the
sunshade
with
her
eyes
those
of
the
stranger
had
a
gleam
but
do
you
think
if
the
unvarnished
truth
may
be
whispered
that
it
becoming
the
merest
trifle
too
hot
she
suggested
maria
dolores
lightly
laughed
i
think
it
is
decidedly
too
hot
she
said
i
glad
to
find
we
of
the
same
opinion
declared
the
old
lady
fanning
herself
you
can
positively
the
heat
vibrating
there
in
the
distance
we
children
of
the
north
should
fly
such
weather
for
my
part
i
off
for
england
where
i
can
shiver
through
the
summer
comfortably
in
my
maria
dolores
laughed
out
again
so
i
driven
over
from
roccadoro
the
newcomer
continued
to
have
a
farewell
look
at
a
young
man
of
my
acquaintance
who
staying
here
i
dare
say
you
may
know
him
he
has
blue
eyes
and
a
red
beard
a
flattering
manner
and
a
pretty
wit
and
his
name
is
blanchemain
oh
said
maria
dolores
her
eyebrows
going
up
is
that
his
name
you
mean
the
young
englishman
who
lives
with
the
parroco
the
old
lady
eyebrows
which
were
thick
and
dark
went
up
too
is
it
possible
you
did
know
his
name
was
her
surprised
ejaculation
then
she
said
i
wonder
whether
he
is
anywhere
about
i
fancy
he
asleep
said
maria
dolores
asleep
at
this
hour
the
dark
eyebrows
frowned
their
protest
that
sounds
like
a
sad
slugabed
maria
dolores
looked
serious
he
was
up
all
night
we
have
a
child
ill
here
and
he
was
up
all
night
watching
the
stranger
grey
eyes
filled
with
concern
and
sympathy
i
hope
sure
it
not
that
pretty
little
girl
the
niece
of
the
parroco
she
said
unhappily
it
is
said
maria
dolores
she
has
been
very
ill
indeed
i
am
extremely
sorry
to
hear
it
extremely
sorry
the
old
lady
declared
with
feeling
if
i
can
be
of
any
sort
of
use
if
i
can
send
anything
or
in
any
way
help
her
eyes
completed
the
offer
oh
thank
you
thank
you
replied
maria
dolores
you
are
most
kind
but
i
do
think
there
is
anything
any
one
can
do
besides
she
is
on
the
mend
now
we
hope
the
doctor
says
the
worst
is
probably
over
well
thank
god
for
that
exclaimed
the
visitor
with
a
will
she
considered
for
a
moment
and
then
reverted
to
the
previous
question
so
you
did
not
know
that
my
vivid
young
friend
name
was
blanchemain
no
said
maria
dolores
it
is
a
good
name
there
none
better
in
england
averred
the
old
lady
with
a
nod
of
emphasis
that
set
the
in
her
bonnet
quivering
oh
said
maria
dolores
looking
politely
interested
he
the
nephew
and
heir
of
lord
blanchemain
of
ventmere
her
instructress
went
on
that
is
one
of
our
most
ancient
peerages
really
said
maria
dolores
what
else
did
she
say
in
her
heart
where
now
was
her
cobbler
son
and
i
glad
to
be
able
to
add
that
i
his
sort
of
connection
i
the
widow
of
the
late
lord
blanchemain
the
lady
paused
then
with
that
smile
of
hers
which
we
know
that
smile
which
went
as
an
to
disarm
resentment
people
of
my
age
are
allowed
to
be
inquisitive
she
premised
i
have
introduced
myself
to
you
wo
you
introduce
yourself
to
me
my
name
is
maria
dolores
of
answered
the
person
questioned
also
smiling
the
widow
of
the
late
lord
blanchemain
inwardly
gasped
but
she
was
quick
to
suppress
all
outward
symptoms
of
that
circumstance
the
daughter
of
eve
in
her
gasped
but
the
practised
old
englishwoman
of
the
world
affably
and
imperturbably
pronounced
with
a
gracious
movement
of
the
head
ah
indeed
you
are
then
of
course
a
relation
of
the
prince
i
am
the
prince
sister
said
maria
dolores
and
as
if
an
explanation
of
her
presence
was
in
order
she
added
i
am
here
visiting
my
old
nurse
and
governess
to
whom
my
brother
has
given
a
pavilion
of
the
castle
for
her
home
lady
blanchemain
fanned
herself
a
miller
daughter
she
thought
with
a
silent
laugh
at
john
expense
and
her
own
i
am
very
glad
to
have
made
your
acquaintance
she
said
and
i
hope
this
may
not
be
our
last
meeting
i
afraid
i
ought
now
to
be
hastening
back
to
roccadoro
i
wonder
whether
you
will
have
the
kindness
when
you
see
him
to
convey
my
parting
benediction
to
blanchemain
oh
no
i
would
not
let
him
be
wakened
not
for
worlds
thank
you
and
with
a
great
effect
of
majesty
and
importance
like
a
conscious
thing
her
carriage
rolled
away
iii
my
romance
is
over
my
april
dream
is
ended
said
the
princess
with
an
air
perhaps
a
feint
of
listless
melancholy
to
frau
brandt
what
mean
you
asked
frau
brandt
unmoved
my
cobbler
son
has
disappeared
has
vanished
in
a
blaze
of
glory
her
serene
highness
explained
and
laughed
i
do
understand
said
frau
brandt
he
has
not
left
alessina
no
but
he
is
a
cobbler
son
at
all
he
merely
been
masquerading
as
one
his
name
is
not
brown
jones
or
robinson
his
name
is
the
name
of
blanchemain
and
he
heir
to
an
english
peerage
ah
so
he
is
then
noble
frau
brandt
inferred
raising
her
eyes
with
satisfaction
as
noble
as
need
be
an
english
peer
is
marriageable
so
here
adieu
to
my
cottage
in
the
air
here
good
riddance
to
it
said
frau
brandt
that
evening
at
the
hour
of
sunset
maria
dolores
met
john
in
the
garden
you
had
a
visitor
this
afternoon
she
announced
a
most
inspiritingly
young
old
lady
as
soft
and
white
as
a
in
a
carriage
that
was
like
a
lady
blanchemain
she
is
leaving
for
england
she
desired
me
to
give
you
her
farewell
blessing
it
will
be
doubly
precious
to
me
by
reason
of
the
medium
through
which
it
comes
said
john
with
his
courtliest
obeisance
there
was
a
little
pause
during
which
she
looked
at
the
western
sky
but
presently
why
did
you
tell
me
you
had
an
uncle
who
was
a
farmer
she
asked
beginning
slowly
to
pace
down
the
pathway
did
i
tell
you
that
i
suppose
i
had
a
boastful
fit
upon
me
john
replied
but
it
very
much
misled
me
said
maria
dolores
oh
it
perfectly
true
said
john
you
are
the
heir
to
a
peerage
said
maria
dolores
john
had
a
gesture
there
you
are
he
said
and
my
uncle
the
peer
spends
much
of
his
time
and
most
of
his
money
breeding
sheep
and
growing
turnips
if
that
is
a
farmer
i
should
like
to
know
what
is
i
hope
you
displayed
less
reticence
regarding
your
station
in
the
world
to
that
woman
you
were
in
love
with
said
she
that
woman
i
in
love
with
john
caught
her
up
that
woman
i
in
love
with
please
oh
are
you
still
in
love
with
her
maria
dolores
wondered
it
is
so
long
since
you
have
spoken
of
her
i
thought
your
heart
was
healed
if
i
have
not
spoken
of
her
it
has
been
because
i
was
under
the
impression
that
you
had
tacitly
forbidden
me
to
do
so
john
informed
her
so
i
had
she
admitted
but
i
find
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
being
too
well
obeyed
she
brought
out
her
last
words
after
the
briefest
possible
suspension
hurriedly
in
a
voice
that
quailed
a
little
as
if
in
terror
of
its
own
audacity
john
with
tingling
pulses
turned
upon
her
but
she
according
to
her
habit
at
such
times
refused
him
her
eyes
he
could
see
though
that
her
eyelashes
trembled
oh
he
cried
i
love
her
so
much
i
need
her
so
i
suppose
i
shall
end
by
doing
the
dishonourable
thing
did
you
ever
tell
her
that
you
were
lord
blanchemain
heir
she
asked
i
never
thought
of
it
why
should
i
said
john
when
you
were
bemoaning
your
poverty
as
an
obstacle
to
marriage
you
might
have
remembered
that
your
birth
counted
for
something
with
us
austrians
for
example
birth
counts
for
almost
everything
for
infinitely
more
than
money
i
think
said
john
as
one
impersonally
generalizing
that
a
with
a
tuft
is
the
least
admirable
variety
of
that
animal
i
wish
you
could
see
what
beautiful
little
ears
she
has
and
the
lovely
way
in
which
her
dark
hair
droops
about
them
how
long
ago
was
it
mused
she
that
love
first
made
people
fancy
they
saw
beauties
which
had
no
real
existence
oh
the
moment
you
see
a
thing
it
acquires
real
existence
john
returned
the
act
of
seeing
is
an
act
of
creation
the
thing
you
see
has
real
existence
on
your
retina
and
in
your
mind
if
nowhere
else
and
that
is
the
realest
sort
of
real
existence
then
she
must
thank
you
as
the
creator
of
her
ears
laughed
maria
dolores
i
wonder
whether
that
sunset
has
any
real
existence
and
whether
it
is
really
as
splendid
as
it
seems
the
west
had
become
a
vast
sea
of
gold
a
pure
and
placid
sea
of
gold
bounded
and
intersected
and
broken
into
innumerable
wide
bays
and
narrow
inlets
by
great
purple
and
rose
and
umber
directly
opposite
just
above
the
of
the
hills
hung
the
nearly
full
moon
pale
as
a
mere
phantom
of
itself
and
from
somewhere
in
the
boscage
at
the
garden
end
came
a
deep
and
liquid
and
complaining
which
one
knew
to
be
the
preliminary
of
philomel
if
some
things
said
john
derive
their
beauty
from
the
eye
of
the
beholder
the
beauty
of
other
things
is
determined
by
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
person
you
long
to
share
all
beautiful
visions
with
the
sky
the
clouds
the
whole
air
and
earth
this
evening
seem
to
me
beauty
in
its
ultimate
perfection
maria
dolores
softly
laughed
softly
softly
and
for
a
long
time
by
the
marble
balustrade
that
guarded
this
particular
terrace
of
the
garden
they
stood
in
silence
the
western
gold
burned
to
red
and
more
sombre
red
the
gloomed
purpler
the
pale
moon
kindled
and
shone
like
ice
afire
with
its
intense
cold
brilliancy
the
olive
woods
against
the
sky
lay
black
a
score
of
nightingales
near
and
far
were
calling
and
sobbing
and
exulting
and
two
human
spirits
yearned
with
the
mystery
of
love
my
income
said
john
all
at
once
brusquely
coming
to
earth
is
exactly
six
hundred
pounds
a
year
i
suppose
two
people
live
on
that
though
i
dashed
if
i
see
how
of
course
we
could
live
in
england
where
that
infernal
future
peerage
would
put
us
under
a
thousand
obligations
but
i
dare
say
we
might
find
a
garret
here
in
italy
the
question
is
would
she
be
willing
or
have
i
any
right
to
ask
her
to
marry
me
on
the
condition
of
leaving
her
own
money
untouched
and
living
with
me
on
mine
apropos
of
future
peerages
and
things
said
maria
dolores
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
she
has
any
rank
of
her
own
to
keep
up
i
do
care
twopence
about
her
rank
said
john
do
you
happen
to
know
her
name
she
asked
i
know
what
i
wish
her
name
was
john
promptly
answered
i
wish
to
heaven
it
was
blanchemain
maria
dolores
gazed
pensive
at
the
moon
he
does
not
even
know
her
name
she
remarked
on
a
key
of
meditation
though
he
fears
she
sadly
shook
her
head
he
fears
it
may
be
smitti
oh
i
say
cried
john
wincing
with
a
kind
of
sorry
giggle
and
i
do
know
whether
he
looked
or
felt
the
more
sheepish
his
face
showed
every
signal
of
humiliation
he
tugged
nervously
at
his
beard
but
his
eyes
in
spite
of
him
his
very
blue
blue
eyes
were
full
of
vexed
amusement
the
bell
in
the
struck
eight
there
it
is
your
hour
for
going
to
annunziata
said
maria
dolores
you
have
not
answered
my
question
said
john
i
will
think
about
it
said
she
iv
annunziata
delirium
had
passed
but
in
spite
of
all
their
efforts
to
persuade
her
not
to
talk
talk
she
would
this
is
the
month
of
may
is
it
she
asked
next
morning
yes
dear
one
said
maria
dolores
whose
watch
it
was
and
that
is
the
month
of
mary
san
luca
ought
to
hurry
up
and
make
me
well
so
that
i
can
keep
flowers
on
the
lady
altar
then
if
you
wish
to
get
well
quickly
said
maria
dolores
you
must
try
not
to
talk
nor
even
to
think
if
you
can
help
it
you
know
the
doctor
does
not
want
you
to
talk
all
right
i
wo
talk
a
going
clock
may
be
always
wrong
but
a
stopped
clock
is
right
twice
a
day
so
stop
your
tongue
and
avoid
folly
my
uncle
told
me
that
he
never
talks
and
now
shall
you
and
i
imitate
his
example
proposed
maria
dolores
her
lips
compressed
were
plainly
the
gaolers
of
a
laugh
yes
said
annunziata
but
i
ca
help
thinking
of
those
poor
flowers
all
may
flowers
are
born
to
be
put
on
the
lady
altar
those
poor
flowers
are
missing
what
they
were
born
for
they
must
be
very
sad
this
afternoon
every
afternoon
maria
dolores
promised
i
will
put
flowers
on
the
lady
altar
now
see
if
you
ca
shut
your
eyes
and
rest
for
a
little
while
i
once
found
a
toad
on
the
lady
altar
what
do
you
think
he
was
there
for
asked
annunziata
i
ca
think
i
sure
said
maria
dolores
well
when
i
first
saw
him
i
was
angry
and
i
was
going
to
get
a
broom
and
sweep
him
away
but
then
i
thought
it
must
be
very
hard
to
be
a
toad
and
that
you
ca
help
being
a
toad
if
you
are
born
one
and
i
thought
that
perhaps
that
toad
was
there
praying
that
he
might
be
changed
from
a
toad
to
something
else
so
i
did
sweep
him
away
have
you
ever
heard
of
the
little
mass
of
corruption
that
lay
in
a
garden
no
said
maria
dolores
well
said
annunziata
once
upon
a
time
a
little
mass
of
corruption
lay
in
a
garden
but
it
did
not
know
it
was
a
mass
of
corruption
and
it
did
not
wish
to
be
a
mass
of
corruption
and
it
never
did
any
harm
or
wished
any
harm
to
any
one
but
just
lay
there
all
day
long
and
thought
how
beautiful
the
sky
was
and
how
good
and
warm
the
sun
and
how
sweet
the
flowers
were
and
the
and
thanked
god
with
all
its
heart
for
having
given
it
such
a
lovely
place
to
lie
in
yet
all
the
while
you
know
it
could
help
being
what
it
was
a
little
mass
of
corruption
and
at
the
close
of
the
day
some
people
who
were
walking
in
the
garden
saw
it
and
cried
out
what
a
horrible
little
mass
of
corruption
and
they
called
the
gardener
and
had
it
buried
in
the
earth
but
the
little
mass
of
corruption
when
it
heard
that
it
a
little
mass
of
corruption
felt
very
very
sad
and
it
made
a
supplication
to
our
lady
do
not
wish
to
be
a
mass
of
corruption
it
said
of
heaven
pray
for
me
that
i
may
be
purified
and
made
clean
and
not
be
a
mass
of
corruption
any
longer
and
that
i
may
then
go
back
to
the
garden
out
of
this
dark
earth
so
our
lady
prayed
for
it
and
it
was
cleansed
with
water
and
purified
and
what
do
you
think
the
little
mass
of
corruption
became
it
became
a
rose
a
red
rose
in
that
very
garden
just
where
they
had
buried
it
from
which
we
see
but
i
do
quite
remember
what
we
see
from
it
she
broke
off
the
pain
of
baffled
effort
on
her
brow
my
uncle
could
tell
you
that
afterwards
for
a
few
minutes
she
was
silent
lying
quite
still
with
her
eyes
on
the
ceiling
why
do
sunny
lands
produce
dark
people
and
dark
lands
light
people
she
asked
all
at
once
ah
do
begin
to
talk
again
dear
maria
dolores
pleaded
the
doctor
will
he
coming
soon
now
and
he
will
be
angry
if
he
finds
that
i
have
let
you
talk
oh
i
will
tell
him
that
it
is
your
fault
said
annunziata
i
will
tell
him
that
you
did
let
me
but
that
i
talked
because
it
is
so
hard
to
lie
here
and
think
think
think
and
not
be
allowed
to
say
what
you
are
thinking
prospero
asked
me
that
question
about
sunny
lands
a
long
time
ago
i
been
thinking
and
thinking
but
i
ca
think
it
out
have
you
a
great
deal
of
money
are
you
very
rich
darling
wo
you
please
not
talk
any
more
maria
dolores
implored
her
i
stop
pretty
soon
said
annunziata
i
think
you
are
very
rich
i
think
in
spite
of
his
saying
her
name
is
not
maria
dolores
that
you
are
the
dark
woman
whom
prospero
is
to
marry
he
is
to
marry
a
dark
woman
who
will
be
very
rich
but
then
he
will
also
he
very
rich
himself
is
austria
a
sunny
land
england
must
be
a
dark
land
for
prospero
is
light
let
me
see
your
left
hand
please
and
i
will
tell
you
whether
you
are
to
marry
a
light
man
hush
said
maria
dolores
trying
not
to
laugh
that
shall
be
some
other
time
would
you
like
to
marry
prospero
i
would
said
annunziata
i
think
i
hear
the
wheels
of
the
doctor
gig
said
maria
dolores
now
we
shall
both
be
scolded
but
of
course
if
you
do
marry
him
i
ca
annunziata
pursued
undaunted
by
this
menace
a
man
is
allowed
to
have
two
wives
unless
he
is
a
king
he
may
have
two
sisters
or
two
daughters
but
not
two
wives
or
two
mothers
there
was
once
a
king
named
salomone
who
had
a
thousand
wives
but
even
he
had
only
one
mother
i
think
i
hope
you
will
live
at
sant
alessina
after
your
marriage
will
you
maria
dolores
bit
her
lip
and
vouchsafed
no
answer
and
again
for
a
minute
or
two
annunziata
lay
silent
but
presently
have
you
ever
waked
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
felt
terribly
frightened
she
asked
yes
dear
sometimes
i
suppose
every
one
has
said
maria
dolores
well
do
you
know
why
people
feel
so
frightened
when
they
wake
like
that
pursued
the
child
no
said
maria
dolores
i
do
said
annunziata
the
middle
of
the
night
is
the
devil
noon
nobody
is
awake
in
the
middle
of
the
night
except
wicked
people
like
thieves
or
roysterers
or
people
who
are
suffering
all
people
who
are
good
and
who
are
well
and
happy
are
sound
asleep
so
it
is
the
time
the
devil
likes
best
and
he
and
all
his
evil
spirits
come
to
the
earth
to
enjoy
the
great
pleasure
of
seeing
people
wicked
or
suffering
and
that
is
why
we
feel
so
frightened
when
we
wake
the
air
all
round
us
is
full
of
evil
spirits
though
we
ca
see
them
and
they
are
watching
us
to
run
and
tell
the
devil
if
we
do
anything
wicked
or
suffer
any
pain
but
it
is
foolish
of
us
to
feel
frightened
because
our
guardian
angels
are
always
there
too
and
they
are
a
hundred
times
stronger
than
the
evil
spirits
angels
you
know
are
very
big
very
much
bigger
than
men
some
of
them
are
as
tall
as
mountains
but
even
the
quite
small
ones
are
as
tall
as
trees
this
time
i
really
do
hear
wheels
said
maria
dolores
with
an
accent
of
thanksgiving
and
she
rose
to
meet
the
doctor
v
john
sat
in
his
room
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
a
tiny
he
spread
it
out
upon
his
knee
and
laughed
he
crumpled
it
up
in
his
palm
and
pressed
it
to
his
face
and
drank
deep
of
its
faint
perfume
faint
but
powerfully
provocative
of
visions
and
emotions
he
had
found
it
during
the
night
on
the
floor
of
the
and
had
captured
and
borne
it
away
like
a
treasure
he
spread
it
out
on
his
knee
again
and
was
again
about
to
laugh
at
its
small
size
and
gauzy
texture
when
his
eye
was
caught
by
something
in
its
corner
he
held
it
nearer
to
the
window
the
thing
that
had
caught
his
eye
was
a
cypher
surmounted
by
a
crown
embroidered
so
minutely
as
almost
to
call
for
a
magnifying
glass
but
without
a
glass
he
could
see
that
the
cypher
was
composed
of
the
initials
m
and
d
and
that
the
crown
was
not
a
coronet
but
a
closed
crown
of
the
pattern
worn
by
mediatised
princes
what
on
earth
can
be
the
meaning
of
this
he
wondered
frowning
and
breathing
quick
but
he
was
stopped
from
further
speculation
for
the
moment
by
a
knock
at
the
door
the
postman
entered
with
two
letters
for
one
of
which
as
it
was
registered
john
had
to
sign
when
he
had
tipped
the
postman
and
was
alone
again
he
put
his
registered
letter
on
the
with
a
view
to
disciplining
curiosity
and
exercising
patience
possibly
and
turned
his
attention
to
the
other
in
a
handsome
high
old
hand
that
somehow
reminded
him
of
the
writer
voice
it
ran
as
follows
dear
john
i
was
not
to
see
you
when
i
drove
over
to
say
this
afternoon
but
chance
favoured
me
at
least
to
the
extent
of
letting
me
see
your
miller
daughter
and
you
may
believe
that
i
was
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
inspect
her
at
close
quarters
my
dear
boy
she
is
no
more
a
miller
daughter
than
you
are
her
beauty
there
in
it
her
manner
and
carriage
her
voice
accent
her
way
of
dressing
i
give
a
sovereign
for
the
name
of
her
dressmaker
the
fineness
of
her
skin
her
hair
everything
there
race
in
all
race
and
consciousness
of
race
pride
dignity
distinction
these
things
do
come
to
pass
in
a
generation
i
surprised
at
your
lack
of
perspicacity
and
those
blue
eyes
of
yours
look
so
sharp
too
but
perhaps
your
wish
was
father
to
your
thought
you
felt
well
and
so
to
some
extent
did
i
that
it
would
be
more
she
probably
a
very
great
swell
indeed
and
i
expect
the
frau
staying
with
will
turn
out
to
be
her
old
governess
or
nurse
or
something
when
those
austrians
show
quarterings
of
course
you
must
bar
recent
creations
they
generally
named
cohen
they
can
show
them
to
some
effect
they
think
nothing
of
all
of
which
rather
rejoices
me
for
if
she
really
had
been
a
miller
daughter
it
would
have
seemed
a
good
deal
like
throwing
yourself
away
and
who
knows
what
your
rusty
crusty
old
uncle
might
have
said
i
long
had
a
rod
in
pickle
for
and
day
i
applied
it
do
forget
the
pig
you
purchased
so
gallantly
and
confidingly
i
would
not
to
the
marriage
of
true
minds
admit
impediments
your
pig
will
gobble
up
you
should
by
this
have
received
a
communication
from
my
solicitors
remember
you
have
pledged
your
sacred
promise
there
must
be
no
question
of
trying
to
shirk
or
burke
it
remember
that
i
am
quite
outrageously
rich
i
have
no
children
of
my
own
and
no
very
near
relatives
and
my
distant
ones
are
intensely
disagreeable
and
i
ca
help
looking
upon
the
heir
of
the
blanchemains
as
a
kind
of
spiritual
son
in
your
position
there
no
such
thing
as
having
too
much
money
take
all
that
comes
and
never
mind
the
quarter
whence
they
plymouth
brethren
and
send
me
tracts
now
till
august
if
not
before
for
of
course
in
august
you
must
come
to
me
at
fring
will
you
bring
your
bride
when
and
where
the
wedding
i
suppose
they
want
it
in
austria
beware
of
long
engagements
or
of
too
short
ones
the
autumn
the
time
the
only
pretty
you
see
you
need
some
months
for
the
preparation
of
your
trousseau
i
love
a
man
to
be
smart
well
i
was
so
sorry
about
that
child
illness
but
thankful
to
hear
she
was
mending
yours
affectionately
linda
blanchemain
and
his
registered
letter
when
at
last
he
opened
it
ran
thus
dear
sir
pursuant
to
instructions
received
from
our
client
lady
blanchemain
we
beg
to
hand
you
herewith
our
cheque
for
seven
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
stg
and
to
request
the
favour
of
your
receipt
for
the
same
together
with
the
address
of
your
bankers
that
we
may
pay
in
quarterly
a
like
sum
to
your
account
it
being
her
ladyship
intention
immediately
upon
her
return
to
england
to
effect
a
settlement
upon
yourself
and
heirs
of

of

we
are
further
to
have
the
pleasure
to
inform
you
that
by
the
terms
of
a
will
just
prepared
by
us
and
to

residuary
legatee
with
compliments
and
respectful
congratulations
we
have
the
honour
dear
sir
to
be
your
obedient
servants
farrow
bernscot
and
tisdale
and
then
there
came
another
tap
at
the
door
and
it
was
the
postman
who
had
returned
with
a
third
letter
which
like
the
true
italian
postman
that
he
was
he
had
forgotten
and
i
fancy
if
it
had
been
for
that
tip
still
warm
in
his
pocket
the
fellow
would
have
allowed
it
to
stand
over
till
he
made
at
any
rate
a
great
virtue
of
having
discovered
it
and
of
having
retraced
his
steps
the
letter
was
written
in
black
angular
uncompromising
characters
that
looked
rather
like
and
bayonets
it
read
dear
jack
i
have
received
the
enclosure
from
linda
lady
blanchemain
she
is
an
exceedingly
impertinent
and
meddlesome
old
woman
but
she
is
right
about
the
allowance
i
do
know
why
i
never
thought
of
it
myself
i
do
know
why
you
never
suggested
it
i
extremely
regret
it
as
next
in
succession
you
are
certainly
entitled
to
an
annuity
from
the
estate
i
have
remitted
to
your
bankers
and
am
instructing
my
agents
to
pay
in
a
like
amount
quarterly
i
hope
i
shall
soon
be
seeing
you
at
ventmere
we
are
having
a
grand
lambing
season
but
there
a
nasty
spread
of
and
the
whole
country
papered
with
handbills
i
got
a
goodish
bit
of
hunting
down
at
wilsborough
during
the
winter
now
nothing
to
do
but
play
golf
i
never
could
find
any
fun
in
shooting
rooks
your
affectionate
uncle
b
of
and
the
enclosure
linda
lady
blanchemain
presents
her
compliments
to
lord
blanchemain
of
ventmere
and
begs
to
apprise
him
that
she
has
lately
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
his
lordship
nephew
john
and
has
discovered
to
her
amazement
that
his
lordship
makes
him
no
allowance
this
situation
for
the
heir
to
the
barony
of
blanchemain
is
of
course
absurd
and
must
lady
blanchemain
is
sure
be
due
entirely
to
an
oversight
on
his
lordship
part
she
ventures
therefore
with
all
respect
to
bring
it
to
his
notice
so
here
sat
a
young
man
with
plenty
to
think
about
a
young
man
whose
income
yesterday
a
bare
six
hundred
had
sprung
up
over
night
to
something
near
six
thousand
six
thousand
a
year
is
opulence
if
you
like
but
a
young
man
possessing
it
can
hardly
look
upon
himself
as
quite
either
this
young
man
however
had
other
things
as
well
to
think
of
what
of
that
embroidered
handkerchief
what
of
those
shrewd
suspicions
of
lady
blanchemain
what
of
his
miller
daughter
and
there
was
another
thing
still
what
of
his
proud
old
honest
spartan
of
an
unimaginative
uncle
he
thought
of
him
and
oh
the
poor
old
boy
he
cried
not
for
ten
times
the
money
would
i
have
had
the
dear
old
woman
write
to
him
like
that
how
hard
it
must
have
hit
him
m
d
and
a
princely
crown
he
reflected
i
wish
i
had
an
almanach
de
gotha
vi
who
was
it
said
of
some
one
that
he
dearly
loved
a
lord
maria
dolores
her
chin
in
the
air
asked
of
frau
brandt
i
do
not
know
frau
brandt
replied
knitting
well
at
least
you
know
whether
it
would
be
possible
for
a
man
and
wife
to
live
luxuriously
on
sixpence
a
week
would
it
pursued
her
tease
you
are
well
aware
that
it
would
not
said
frau
brandt
how
about
six
hundred
pounds
a
year
six
hundred
pounds
frau
brandt
computed
that
would
be
six
thousand
florins
no
it
would
depend
upon
their
station
in
the
world
well
suppose
their
station
were
about
my
station
and
my
lord
you
said
frau
brandt
with
a
chuckle
of
contentment
swaying
her
head
you
would
need
twice
that
for
your
dress
alone
one
could
dress
more
simply
said
maria
dolores
no
said
frau
brandt
her
good
eyes
beaming
you
must
always
dress
in
the
very
finest
that
can
be
had
but
then
maria
dolores
asked
with
wistfulness
what
am
i
to
do
for
six
hundred
pounds
is
the
total
of
his
income
you
have
unless
i
am
mistaken
an
income
of
your
own
frau
brandt
remarked
yes
but
he
wo
let
me
use
it
said
maria
dolores
he
who
demanded
frau
brandt
bridling
who
is
there
that
dares
to
say
let
or
not
let
to
you
my
future
husband
said
maria
dolores
he
has
peculiar
ideas
of
honour
he
does
not
like
the
notion
of
marrying
a
woman
who
is
richer
than
himself
so
he
will
marry
me
only
on
the
condition
that
i
send
my
own
fortune
to
be
dropped
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
what
nonsense
is
this
said
frau
brandt
composed
no
it
is
the
truth
said
maria
dolores
the
true
truth
he
is
too
proud
to
live
in
luxury
at
his
wife
expense
i
like
a
man
making
conditions
when
it
is
a
question
of
marrying
you
said
frau
brandt
with
scorn
so
do
i
said
maria
dolores
with
heartiness
well
at
any
rate
i
am
glad
to
see
that
he
is
not
after
you
for
your
money
frau
brandt
reflected
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
dress
in
sackcloth
and
dine
on
lentils
said
maria
dolores
of
course
you
will
tell
him
to
take
his
conditions
to
the
old
one
said
frau
brandt
it
is
out
of
the
question
for
you
to
change
the
manner
of
your
life
i
feel
indeed
as
if
it
were
admitted
maria
dolores
but
if
he
insists
then
tell
him
to
go
to
the
old
one
himself
was
frau
brandt
blunt
advice
maria
dolores
laughed
it
seems
like
an
she
said
who
is
to
break
the
news
to
my
brother
we
will
wait
until
there
is
some
news
to
break
the
old
woman
amiably
grumbled
again
at
the
sunset
hour
maria
dolores
met
him
in
the
garden
he
was
seated
on
one
of
their
marble
benches
amongst
marble
columns
by
the
western
light
and
casting
long
purple
shadows
in
a
pergola
he
was
leaning
forward
legs
crossed
brow
wrinkled
as
one
deep
in
thought
but
of
course
at
the
sound
of
her
footstep
he
jumped
up
what
mighty
problem
were
you
revolving
she
asked
you
looked
like
rembrandt
en
i
was
revolving
the
problem
of
human
love
he
answered
i
was
mutilating
browning
it
something
said
something
done
was
it
touch
of
hand
turn
of
head
i
was
also
thinking
about
you
i
was
wondering
whether
it
would
be
my
cruel
destiny
not
to
see
you
this
evening
and
thinking
of
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
you
oh
said
she
lightly
that
morning
among
the
olives
when
you
gathered
the
windflowers
for
me
no
said
he
that
was
the
second
time
indeed
said
she
surprised
she
sat
down
on
the
marble
bench
john
stood
before
her
yes
said
he
the
first
time
was
the
day
before
you
were
crossing
the
garden
you
were
bending
over
the
and
i
spied
upon
you
from
a
window
of
the
lady
blanchemain
was
there
with
me
and
she
made
a
prediction
what
did
she
predict
asked
maria
dolores
unsuspicious
she
predicted
that
i
would
fall
but
he
dropped
his
sentence
in
the
middle
she
predicted
what
has
happened
oh
murmured
maria
dolores
and
looked
at
the
horizon
that
morning
among
the
olives
was
the
first
time
that
i
saw
you
when
you
dashed
like
a
paladin
to
my
assistance
i
feel
that
i
have
never
sufficiently
thanked
you
a
paladin
oddly
panoplied
said
john
tell
me
honestly
were
you
in
two
minds
whether
or
not
to
reward
me
with
largesse
you
had
silver
in
your
hand
maria
dolores
laughed
i
think
she
coloured
a
little
perhaps
i
was
for
half
a
second
she
confessed
but
your
grand
manner
soon
put
me
in
one
mind
john
also
laughed
he
took
a
turn
backwards
and
forwards
i
have
waked
in
the
dead
of
night
and
grown
hot
and
cold
to
remember
the
figure
of
fun
i
was
no
said
maria
dolores
to
console
him
you
were
a
figure
of
fun
your
costume
had
the
air
of
being
an
impromptu
but
she
laughed
your
native
dignity
shone
through
thank
you
said
john
bowing
the
next
time
i
saw
you
was
that
same
afternoon
you
were
with
annunziata
in
the
avenue
i
carried
my
vision
of
you
like
a
melody
all
the
way
to
all
the
way
home
again
i
had
just
made
annunziata
acquaintance
said
maria
dolores
you
had
a
white
sunshade
and
a
lilac
frock
said
john
the
next
time
was
that
night
in
the
moonlight
you
were
all
in
white
with
a
scarf
of
white
lace
over
your
hair
you
threw
me
a
white
rose
from
your
balcony
and
i
have
carried
that
rose
with
me
ever
since
i
threw
you
a
white
rose
doubted
maria
dolores
looking
up
at
fault
yes
said
john
have
you
forgotten
it
i
certainly
have
said
she
with
emphasis
you
threw
me
a
smile
that
was
like
a
white
rose
said
he
she
laughed
i
think
i
just
distantly
acknowledged
your
bow
she
said
well
some
people
distant
acknowledgments
are
like
white
roses
said
he
i
hope
at
least
you
remember
what
a
glorious
night
it
was
and
how
the
nightingales
were
singing
yes
said
she
i
remember
that
i
have
a
fancy
he
declared
that
it
will
be
a
more
glorious
night
still
and
that
the
nightingales
will
sing
better
than
they
have
ever
sung
before
maria
dolores
did
not
speak
do
you
happen
john
asked
after
a
long
silence
while
they
gazed
at
the
deepening
colours
in
the
west
do
you
happen
to
possess
such
a
thing
as
a
copy
of
the
almanach
de
gotha
yes
said
she
really
i
wonder
whether
you
will
lend
it
to
me
i
am
sorry
it
is
in
vienna
and
after
an
instant
pause
she
ventured
what
if
it
is
indiscreet
to
inquire
do
you
wish
to
look
up
i
wish
to
look
up
a
lady
a
dream
lady
a
lady
who
walks
in
beauty
like
the
night
of
cloudless
climes
and
whose
are
embroidered
with
the
initials
in
a
cypher
under
a
princely
crown
i
should
think
said
maria
dolores
considering
that
she
would
probably
be
a
member
of
one
of
the
mediatised
princely
houses
but
if
you
have
nothing
more
than
her
initials
to
go
by
you
would
find
it
difficult
to
trace
her
in
the
almanach
de
gotha
no
doubt
said
john
but
to
a
man
of
spirit
a
difficulty
is
a
challenge
do
you
make
a
practice
asked
she
of
appropriating
handkerchiefs
certain
people
yes
unblushing
he
promptly
owned
under
a
princely
crown
i
think
you
said
she
mused
it
occurs
to
me
that
maria
dolores
of
might
be
so
embroidered
ah
said
john
that
would
be
a
daughter
of
the
man
who
owns
this
castle
no
she
is
a
sister
of
the
man
who
owns
this
castle
i
understand
said
john
i
wonder
that
the
sister
of
the
man
who
owns
this
castle
never
comes
here
to
see
how
fine
it
is
she
has
been
here
quite
recently
said
maria
dolores
she
has
been
here
visiting
her
who
lives
in
the
pavilion
beyond
the
clock
she
came
to
make
a
sort
of
retreat
to
think
something
over
yes
questioned
he
her
brother
is
very
anxious
to
marry
her
off
he
is
anxious
that
she
should
marry
her
second
cousin
the
prince
of
she
came
here
to
make
up
her
mind
has
she
made
it
up
he
asked
i
am
not
sure
said
she
yet
you
seem
to
be
deep
in
her
confidence
said
he
yes
but
she
is
not
quite
sure
herself
oh
said
john
she
is
one
of
those
foolish
women
who
dream
of
marriage
as
a
high
romance
wise
men
said
john
dream
of
it
as
the
highest
she
shook
her
head
a
marriage
with
her
cousin
would
be
an
end
to
all
romance
for
ever
she
was
thinking
a
little
while
ago
i
believe
of
marrying
a
plain
commoner
the
nephew
of
a
farmer
that
would
have
been
indeed
romantic
now
i
hear
she
is
considering
a
future
member
of
your
english
house
of
lords
would
even
that
be
rather
romantic
if
a
step
down
constitutes
romance
john
suggested
oh
a
british
peer
is
scarcely
a
step
down
she
returned
besides
there
are
people
who
do
care
what
is
the
expression
twopence
about
rank
when
i
said
that
john
explained
i
had
no
inkling
that
her
rank
was
so
exalted
did
you
think
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
cobbler
maria
dolores
quickly
with
some
haughtiness
inquired
i
thought
she
was
a
daughter
of
the
stars
john
answered
and
you
feared
her
name
was
smitti
she
said
haughtiness
dissolving
in
mirth
i
will
never
tell
you
what
she
feared
that
yours
was
see
said
john
how
they
are
hanging
the
heavens
with
banners
it
must
be
in
honour
of
some
great
impending
event
yesterday
the
west
had
been
a
sea
it
was
a
city
a
vast
grey
and
violet
city
with
palaces
and
battlemented
towers
and
countless
airy
spires
and
pinnacles
and
here
there
everywhere
its
walls
were
gay
with
gold
and
crimson
as
with
drooping
banners
is
a
city
said
john
is
the
city
where
marriages
are
made
they
must
have
one
in
hand
hark
said
she
putting
up
a
finger
there
are
your
nightingales
beginning
but
the
raised
finger
reminded
him
of
something
have
you
a
rooted
objection
to
rings
he
asked
why
asked
she
i
notice
that
you
do
wear
any
oh
sometimes
i
wear
many
she
said
then
one
has
moods
in
which
one
leaves
them
off
i
have
a
ring
in
my
pocket
which
i
think
belongs
to
you
said
he
really
i
do
know
that
any
of
my
rings
are
missing
here
it
is
said
he
he
produced
the
little
old
shagreen
case
he
had
received
from
lady
blanchemain
opened
and
offered
it
it
is
a
singularly
beautiful
ring
said
she
her
eyes
admiring
but
it
does
belong
to
me
i
think
it
does
said
he
may
i
try
it
on
your
finger
she
put
forth
her
right
hand
no
your
left
hand
please
he
said
he
dropped
upon
one
knee
before
her
and
when
the
delicate
white
hand
was
surrendered
i
imagine
he
made
of
getting
the
ring
upon
the
alliance
finger
a
longer
business
by
a
good
deal
than
was
necessary
there
he
said
in
the
end
you
see
it
looks
as
if
it
had
grown
there
of
course
it
belongs
to
you
he
still
held
her
hand
warm
and
firm
and
i
think
in
another
second
he
would
have
touched
it
with
his
lips
but
she
drew
it
away
she
gazed
into
the
depths
of
the
ruby
tremulous
with
liquid
light
and
smiled
as
at
secret
thoughts
but
i
do
see
said
john
getting
to
his
feet
how
any
man
can
ask
a
princess
of
the
house
of
zelt
to
marry
him
and
live
on
six
hundred
pounds
a
year
she
would
have
to
modify
her
habits
a
good
deal
that
is
very
certain
said
maria
dolores
she
would
have
to
modify
them
utterly
said
john
six
hundred
a
year
is
poverty
even
for
a
single
man
for
a
married
couple
it
would
be
beggary
she
would
have
to
live
like
the
wife
of
a
petty
employ√©
she
would
have
to
travel
second
class
and
stay
at
hotels
she
would
have
to
turn
her
old
dresses
and
trim
her
own
bonnets
she
would
have
to
do
without
a
maid
and
all
this
means
that
she
would
have
virtually
to
renounce
her
caste
to
give
up
the
society
of
her
equals
who
demand
a
certain
scale
of
appearances
and
to
live
among
pariahs
or
to
live
in
isolation
do
you
think
a
man
would
be
a
monster
of
selfishness
to
exact
such
sacrifices
oh
some
men
have
excessively
and
morbid
notions
of
honour
said
she
do
you
think
the
princess
with
all
this
brought
to
her
attention
would
ever
dream
of
consenting
women
in
love
are
weak
they
will
consent
to
almost
anything
said
she
her
dark
eyes
smiling
for
an
instant
into
his
why
did
he
take
her
in
his
arms
hope
deferred
maketh
the
heart
sick
but
to
defer
the
consummation
of
a
joy
assured
observes
the
persian
poet
giveth
the
heart
a
peculiar
sweet
excitement
well
said
john
i
glad
to
think
she
is
weak
but
i
never
ask
my
wife
to
consent
to
anything
so
unpleasant
a
princess
and
a
future
peeress
living
on
six
hundred
pounds
a
year
it
unheard
of
she
looked
at
him
puzzled
incredulous
oh
can
you
possibly
mean
that
you
will
take
back
your
condition
yes
said
he
humbly
who
am
i
to
make
conditions
you
will
let
her
spend
as
much
of
her
own
money
as
she
likes
she
wondered
as
a
lover
of
thrift
i
shall
deprecate
extravagance
said
john
but
as
a
submissive
husband
i
shall
let
her
do
in
all
things
as
her
fancy
dictates
well
marvelled
she
here
is
a
surprise
here
is
a
indeed
and
she
looked
at
the
city
in
the
sky
and
appeared
to
turn
things
over
john
was
mysteriously
chuckling
have
you
your
opinion
he
asked
of
men
who
eat
their
words
and
put
their
scruples
in
their
pockets
i
do
understand
said
she
looking
wild
there
is
of
course
some
joke
there
is
a
joke
indeed
said
he
the
joke
is
that
i
ten
times
richer
than
i
told
you
i
was
she
started
back
and
fixed
him
with
a
glance
then
all
that
about
your
being
poor
was
only
humbug
there
was
reproach
in
her
voice
i
not
sure
there
was
disappointment
no
said
he
it
was
the
exact
and
literal
truth
but
i
have
come
into
a
modest
competency
i
do
understand
said
she
my
own
part
in
the
story
is
a
sufficiently
inglorious
one
said
he
i
the
benefactee
lady
blanchemain
and
my
uncle
have
put
their
heads
together
and
endowed
me
i
feel
rather
small
at
letting
them
but
it
enables
me
to
look
my
affianced
boldly
in
the
oh
you
are
affianced
already
she
asked
gaily
no
not
unless
you
are
gaily
answered
john
she
looked
down
at
her
ring
vii
the
end
of
evening
smiled
fainter
fainter
the
aerial
city
its
towers
and
gorgeous
palaces
had
crumbled
into
ruins
and
stars
twinkled
among
their
shattered
and
darkened
walls
the
moon
burned
icily
above
the
eastern
hills
the
nightingales
or
john
was
no
true
prophet
sang
better
than
they
had
ever
sung
before
while
bats
hither
thither
flew
in
startling
as
if
waltzing
to
the
music
and
all
the
air
was
sweet
with
the
breath
of
roses
the
clock
struck
eight
there
you
must
go
said
maria
dolores
go
where
to
asked
john
feigning
vagueness
this
is
no
subject
for
jest
said
she
feigning
severity
i
ca
go
yet
i
ca
leave
you
yet
said
he
besides
it
is
an
education
in
√¶sthetics
to
watch
the
moonlight
on
these
marble
columns
and
the
pale
shadows
of
the
well
then
said
she
stay
you
here
and
pursue
your
education
i
will
go
in
your
place
for
marcella
cuciniera
must
be
relieved
she
rose
and
moved
towards
the
darkling
front
of
the
castle
hang
education
i
go
with
you
said
john
following
i
shall
only
stop
a
moment
to
see
how
she
is
said
maria
dolores
then
i
must
hurry
home
to
get
my
packing
begun
your
packing
faltered
john
morning
frau
brandt
and
i
are
leaving
for
austria
for
schloss
mischenau
where
my
brother
lives
good
lord
said
john
ah
well
i
suppose
it
is
what
they
would
call
the
proper
course
he
admitted
with
gloomy
resignation
but
think
how
dreadfully
you
be
missed
by
annunziata
annunziata
is
so
much
better
i
can
easily
be
spared
said
maria
dolores
and
anyhow
is
needs
must
i
think
you
will
probably
soon
receive
a
letter
from
my
brother
asking
you
to
visit
him
mischenau
is
a
place
worth
seeing
in
its
northern
style
and
in
his
northern
style
my
brother
is
a
man
worth
meeting
i
counsel
you
to
go
i
shall
certainly
go
said
john
i
shall
linger
here
at
alessina
like
a
soul
in
durance
counting
the
hours
till
my
release
i
shall
be
particularly
glad
to
meet
your
brother
as
i
have
matters
of
importance
to
arrange
with
him
until
then
said
she
smiling
i
think
we
must
do
with
those
matters
of
importance
her
voice
quavered
on
the
word
what
is
it
that
the
pope
sometimes
does
with
cardinals
yes
moodily
consented
john
i
suppose
we
must
but
oh
me
what
a
dreary
blank
stale
and
unprofitable
desolation
this
garden
will
become
and
at
every
turn
the
ghost
of
some
past
joy
annunziata
looked
up
with
eyes
that
seemed
omniscient
i
was
thinking
about
you
she
greeted
them
about
which
of
us
asked
john
about
both
of
you
i
always
now
since
a
long
while
think
of
you
both
together
i
think
maria
dolores
is
the
dark
woman
whom
prospero
is
to
marry
john
laughed
maria
dolores
looked
out
of
the
window
and
i
was
thinking
annunziata
went
on
how
strange
it
was
that
if
you
had
both
at
the
same
time
just
happened
to
come
to
alessina
you
might
have
lived
and
died
and
never
have
known
each
other
perish
that
thought
laughed
john
but
i
have
sometimes
thought
it
myself
and
then
annunziata
rounded
out
her
tale
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
had
not
just
happened
that
probably
you
had
been
led
that
is
a
thing
i
have
a
doubt
of
john
with
energy
affirmed
you
look
as
if
you
were
very
glad
about
something
both
of
you
said
annunziata
those
omniscient
eyes
of
hers
studying
their
faces
what
is
it
that
you
are
both
so
glad
of
we
are
so
glad
to
find
you
feeling
so
well
answered
maria
dolores
but
annunziata
shook
her
head
as
one
who
knew
better
no
that
is
not
the
only
thing
you
are
glad
of
something
else
besides
there
no
taking
you
in
said
john
but
we
are
under
bonds
to
treat
that
something
else
as
the
pope
sometimes
treats
princes
of
the
church
he
gives
them
red
hats
said
annunziata
i
shall
give
this
thing
a
crown
of
myrtle
said
john
you
sometimes
say
things
that
sound
as
if
they
had
any
sense
annunziata
informed
him
with
patient
indulgence
nodding
at
the
ceiling
maria
dolores
leaned
over
the
bed
and
kissed
annunziata
brow
good
night
carina
she
murmured
annunziata
put
up
her
little
white
arms
and
encircled
maria
neck
then
she
kissed
her
four
times
on
the
brow
on
the
chin
on
the
left
cheek
on
the
right
that
is
a
cross
of
kisses
she
explained
it
is
the
way
my
mother
used
to
kiss
me
it
means
may
the
four
angels
of
peace
grace
holiness
and
wisdom
watch
over
your
sleep
but
early
next
morning
john
being
still
on
duty
maria
dolores
came
back
booted
and
spurred
for
her
journey
in
tweeds
with
a
little
felt
toque
and
a
veil
a
costume
of
which
annunziata
eyes
were
quick
to
catch
the
suggestion
why
are
you
dressed
like
that
she
asked
uneasily
i
never
saw
you
dressed
like
that
before
you
look
as
if
you
were
going
away
somewhere
i
have
got
to
go
away
i
have
got
to
go
to
my
home
in
austria
i
have
come
to
bid
you
maria
dolores
answered
annunziata
eyes
were
dark
with
pain
oh
she
said
in
a
voice
of
deep
dismay
we
sha
be
separated
long
though
maria
dolores
promised
i
have
asked
your
uncle
to
lend
you
to
me
as
soon
as
you
are
strong
enough
to
travel
you
are
coming
to
austria
to
pay
me
a
long
visit
then
i
will
come
back
with
you
to
sant
alessina
and
then
well
wherever
i
go
you
will
always
go
with
me
for
of
course
i
can
never
live
happily
again
without
you
one
moment
please
put
in
john
here
is
a
small
difficulty
i
can
never
live
happily
without
her
either
i
also
have
asked
her
uncle
to
lend
her
to
me
and
wherever
go
she
is
always
to
go
with
me
how
are
we
to
adjust
our
rival
claims
annunziata
eyes
lighted
up
oh
that
will
be
easy
enough
she
pointed
out
you
will
have
to
go
everywhere
together
the
end
