one
miss
philura
rice
tied
her
faded
under
her
faded
chin
with
hands
that
trembled
a
little
then
she
leaned
forward
and
gazed
anxiously
at
the
reflection
which
confronted
her
a
somewhat
pinched
and
wistful
face
it
was
with
large
blue
eyes
arched
over
with
a
mere
pretense
at
eyebrows
more
than
once
in
her
twenties
miss
philura
had
ventured
to
eke
out
this
scanty
provision
of
nature
with
a
modicum
of
burned
match
stealthily
applied
in
the
privacy
of
her
virgin
chamber
but
the
twenties
with
their
attendant
dreams
and
follies
were
definitely
past
just
how
long
past
no
one
knew
exactly
miss
philura
never
informed
the
curious
on
this
point
as
for
the
insufficient
eyebrows
they
symbolized
as
it
were
a
meagre
and
restricted
life
vaguely
acknowledged
as
the
dispensation
of
an
obscurely
hostile
but
consistent
providence
a
providence
far
too
awful
and
exalted
as
well
as
hostile
to
interest
itself
benignantly
in
so
small
and
neutral
a
personality
as
stared
back
at
her
from
the
large
dim
mirror
of
cousin
maria
van
deuser
back
bedroom
not
that
miss
philura
ever
admitted
such
dubious
thoughts
to
the
select
circle
of
her
conscious
reflections
more
years
ago
than
she
cared
to
count
she
had
grappled
with
her
discontent
had
thrust
it
resolutely
out
of
sight
and
on
the
top
of
it
she
had
planted
a
big
stone
marked
resignation
nevertheless
at
times
the
stone
heaved
and
trembled
ominously
at
sound
of
a
brisk
tap
at
her
chamber
door
the
lady
turned
with
a
guilty
start
to
find
the
impertinent
face
of
the
french
maid
obtruding
itself
into
the
room
ze
madame
waits
announced
this
individual
and
with
a
coldly
comprehensive
eye
swept
the
small
figure
from
head
to
foot
yes
yes
my
dear
i
am
quite
ready
i
am
coming
at
once
faltered
miss
philura
with
a
propitiatory
smile
and
more
than
ever
painfully
aware
that
the
skirt
of
her
best
black
gown
was
irremediably
short
and
scant
that
her
waist
was
too
flat
her
shoulders
too
sloping
her
complexion
faded
her
forehead
wrinkled
and
her
bonnet
unbecoming
as
she
stepped
uncertainly
down
the
dark
narrow
stairway
she
rebuked
herself
severely
for
these
vain
and
worldly
thoughts
to
be
a
church
member
in
good
and
regular
standing
and
a
useful
member
of
society
she
assured
herself
strenuously
should
be
and
sufficient
for
me
ten
minutes
later
miss
philura
looking
smaller
and
more
insignificant
than
usual
was
seated
in
the
carriage
opposite
mortimer
van
deuser
a
large
heavily
upholstered
lady
of
majestic
deportment
paying
diligent
heed
to
the
words
of
wisdom
which
fell
from
the
lips
of
her
hostess
and
kinswoman
during
your
short
stay
in
boston
that
lady
was
remarking
impressively
you
will
of
course
wish
to
avail
yourself
of
those
means
of
culture
and
advancement
so
sadly
lacking
in
your
own
environment
this
my
dear
philura
is
the
era
of
progressive
thought
we
can
have
at
best
i
fear
but
a
faint
conception
of
the
degree
to
which
mankind
will
be
able
in
the
years
of
the
coming
century
to
shake
off
the
gross
and
material
limitations
of
sense
van
deuser
paused
to
settle
her
sables
preliminary
to
recognizing
with
an
expansive
smile
an
acquaintance
who
flashed
by
them
in
a
victoria
after
which
she
adjusted
the
diamonds
in
her
large
pink
ears
and
proceeded
with
unctuous
tranquillity
on
this
occasion
my
dear
philura
you
will
have
the
pleasure
of
listening
to
an
address
by
isabelle
smart
one
of
our
most
advanced
thinkers
along
this
line
you
will
i
trust
be
able
to
derive
from
her
words
aliment
which
will
influence
the
entire
trend
of
your
individual
experience
where
in
what
place
will
the
lady
speak
i
mean
will
it
be
in
the
church
ventured
miss
philura
in
a
depressed
whisper
she
sighed
apprehensively
as
she
glanced
down
at
the
tips
of
her
shabby
gloves
the
lecture
will
take
place
in
the
of
the
ontological
club
responded
van
deuser
adding
with
austere
sweetness
of
tone
the
club
deals
exclusively
with
those
conceptions
or
principles
which
lie
at
the
base
of
all
phenomena
including
being
reality
substance
time
space
motion
change
identity
difference
and
cause
in
a
word
my
dear
philura
with
ultimate
metaphysical
philosophy
a
majestic
and
conclusive
sweep
of
a
perfectly
gloved
hand
suggested
infinity
and
reduced
miss
philura
into
shrinking
silence
when
isabelle
smart
began
to
speak
she
became
almost
directly
aware
of
a
small
wistful
face
with
faded
blue
eyes
and
a
shabby
unbecoming
bonnet
which
surrounded
as
it
was
on
all
sides
by
tossing
plumes
rich
velvets
and
sparkling
gems
with
their
accompaniments
of
patrician
countenances
took
to
itself
a
look
of
positive
distinction
smart
theme
as
announced
by
the
president
of
the
ontological
club
was
thought
forces
and
the
infinite
a
somewhat
subject
but
one
which
the
pale
slight
plainly
dressed
but
singularly
lady
put
forward
as
the
speaker
of
the
afternoon
showed
no
hesitancy
in
attacking
before
three
minutes
had
passed
miss
philura
rice
had
forgotten
that
such
things
as
shabby
gloves
gowns
unbecoming
bonnets
and
superfluous
birthdays
existed
in
ten
minutes
more
she
was
leaning
forward
in
breathless
attention
the
faded
eyes
aglow
the
unbecoming
bonnet
pushed
back
from
a
face
more
wistful
than
ever
but
flushed
with
a
joyful
excitement
this
unseen
good
hems
us
about
on
every
side
the
speaker
was
saying
with
a
comprehensive
sweep
of
her
hands
it
presses
upon
us
more
limitless
more
inexhaustible
more
free
than
the
air
that
we
breathe
out
of
it
need
want
yearning
of
humanity
can
be
must
be
supplied
to
you
who
have
hitherto
led
starved
lives
hungering
longing
for
the
good
things
which
you
believe
a
distant
and
indifferent
god
has
denied
you
to
you
i
declare
that
in
this
encircling
invisible
exhaustless
beneficence
is
already
provided
a
lavish
abundance
of
everything
which
you
can
possibly
want
or
think
nay
desire
itself
is
but
god
good
love
knocking
at
the
door
of
your
consciousness
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
desire
anything
that
is
not
already
your
own
it
only
remains
for
you
to
bring
the
invisible
into
visibility
to
take
of
the
everlasting
substance
what
you
will
and
how
must
you
do
this
ask
and
that
you
you
have
asked
many
times
perhaps
and
have
failed
to
receive
why
you
have
failed
to
ask
then
for
what
you
will
ask
and
at
once
return
thanks
for
what
you
have
asked
in
the
asking
and
is
the
thing
itself
made
manifest
declare
that
it
is
yours
expect
it
believe
it
hold
to
it
without
wavering
no
matter
how
empty
your
hands
may
seem
is
and
god
infinite
creation
shall
lapse
into
nothingness
his
stars
shall
fall
from
high
heaven
like
withered
leaves
sooner
than
that
you
shall
fail
to
obtain
all
that
you
have
asked
when
at
the
close
of
the
lecture
isabelle
smart
became
the
center
of
a
polite
yet
insistent
crush
of
satins
velvets
and
broadcloths
permeated
by
an
aroma
of
violets
and
a
gentle
hum
of
delicate
flattery
she
was
aware
of
a
timid
hand
upon
her
arm
and
turned
to
look
into
the
small
eager
face
under
the
unfashionable
bonnet
you
you
meant
religious
gifts
did
you
not
faltered
the
faint
discouraged
voice
faith
hope
and
and
the
the
being
resigned
to
god
will
and
and
endeavoring
to
bear
the
cross
with
patience
i
meant
that
want
answered
the
one
with
deliberate
emphasis
the
bright
eyes
softening
as
they
took
in
more
completely
the
pinched
outlines
and
the
eager
child
look
shining
from
out
the
worn
and
faded
woman
face
but
but
there
is
so
much
i
i
never
had
anything
that
i
really
wanted
things
you
know
that
one
could
hardly
mention
in
prayers
have
them
now
have
them
all
god
is
all
all
is
god
you
are
god
god
is
yours
then
the
billowing
surges
of
silk
and
velvet
swept
the
small
inquiring
face
into
the
background
with
the
accustomed
ease
and
relentlessness
of
billowing
surges
having
partaken
copiously
of
certain
material
beliefs
consisting
of
salads
and
sandwiches
accompanied
by
divers
cups
of
strong
coffee
mortimer
van
deuser
had
become
pleasantly
flushed
and
expansive
a
most
unique
comprehensive
and
uplifting
view
of
our
spiritual
environment
she
remarked
to
miss
philura
when
the
two
ladies
found
themselves
on
their
homeward
way
her
best
society
smile
still
lingered
blandly
about
the
curves
and
creases
of
her
stolid
visage
the
dying
violets
on
her
massive
satin
bosom
gave
forth
their
sweetest
parting
breath
the
little
lady
on
the
front
seat
of
the
carriage
sat
very
erect
red
spots
glowed
upon
her
faded
cheeks
i
think
she
said
tremulously
that
it
was
just
wonderful
i
i
am
so
very
happy
to
have
heard
it
thank
you
a
thousand
times
dear
cousin
maria
for
taking
me
van
deuser
raised
her
glasses
and
settled
them
under
arching
brows
while
the
society
smile
faded
quite
away
of
course
she
said
coldly
one
should
make
due
and
proper
allowance
for
facts
as
they
exist
and
also
er
consider
above
all
what
interpretation
is
best
suited
to
one
individual
station
in
life
truth
my
dear
philura
adapts
itself
freely
to
the
needs
of
the
poor
and
lowly
as
well
as
to
the
demands
of
those
upon
whom
devolve
the
higher
responsibilities
of
wealth
and
position
our
dear
master
himself
spoke
of
the
poor
as
always
with
us
you
will
remember
a
lowly
but
pious
life
passed
in
humble
recognition
of
god
chastening
providence
is
doubtless
good
and
proper
for
many
worthy
persons
miss
philura
blue
eyes
flashed
rebelliously
for
perhaps
the
first
time
in
uncounted
years
she
made
no
answer
as
for
the
long
and
presumably
instructive
homily
on
the
duties
and
prerogatives
of
the
lowly
lasting
quite
up
to
the
moment
when
the
carriage
stopped
before
the
door
of
van
deuser
residence
it
fell
upon
ears
which
heard
not
indeed
her
next
remark
was
so
entirely
irrelevant
that
her
august
kinswoman
stared
in
displeased
amazement
i
am
going
to
purchase
some
some
necessaries
cousin
maria
i
should
like
fifine
to
go
with
me
miss
philura
acknowledged
to
herself
with
a
truthfulness
which
she
felt
to
be
almost
brazen
that
her
uppermost
yearnings
were
of
a
wholly
mundane
character
during
a
busy
and
joyous
evening
she
endeavored
to
formulate
these
thronging
desires
by
bedtime
she
had
even
ventured
with
the
aid
of
a
stubbed
to
indite
the
most
immediate
and
urgent
of
these
wants
as
they
knocked
at
the
door
of
her
consciousness
the
list
hidden
guiltily
away
in
the
depths
of
her
shabby
purse
read
something
as
follows
i
wish
to
be
beautiful
and
admired
i
want
two
new
dresses
a
hat
with
plumes
and
a
silk
petticoat
that
rustles
i
want
some
new
kid
gloves
and
a
feather
boa
a
long
one
made
of
ostrich
feathers
i
wish
the
small
blunt
pencil
had
been
lifted
in
air
for
the
space
of
three
minutes
before
it
again
descended
then
with
cheeks
that
burned
miss
philura
had
written
the
fateful
words
i
wish
to
have
a
lover
and
to
be
married
there
i
have
done
it
she
said
to
herself
her
little
fingers
trembling
with
agitation
he
must
already
exist
in
the
encircling
good
he
is
mine
i
am
engaged
to
be
married
at
this
very
moment
to
lay
this
singular
memorandum
before
her
maker
appeared
to
miss
philura
little
short
of
sacrilegious
but
the
thought
of
the
mysterious
abundance
of
which
the
seeress
had
spoken
urging
itself
as
it
were
upon
her
acceptance
encouraged
her
she
arose
from
her
evening
orisons
with
a
glowing
face
i
have
asked
she
said
aloud
and
i
i
shall
have
mademoiselle
fifine
passed
a
very
enjoyable
morning
with
miss
philura
to
choose
to
purchase
and
above
all
to
transform
the
ugly
into
the
beautiful
filled
the
french
woman
breast
with
enthusiasm
her
glance
as
it
rested
upon
her
companion
face
and
figure
was
no
longer
coldly
critical
but
cordially
appreciative
ze
madame
she
declared
showing
her
white
teeth
in
a
pleasant
smile
has
very
many
advantage
ze
hair
as
any
one
may
perceive
pardon
while
for
one
little
minute
i
arrange
ah
dieu
regard
ze
difference
the
two
were
at
this
moment
in
a
certain
millinery
shop
conducted
by
a
discreet
and
agreeable
compatriot
of
fifine
this
individual
now
produced
a
modest
hat
of
black
garnished
with
plumes
which
set
lightly
on
the
loosened
bands
of
hair
completed
the
effect
declared
the
french
women
in
chorus
with
a
beating
heart
miss
philura
stared
into
the
mirror
at
her
changed
reflection
it
is
quite
quite
true
she
said
aloud
it
is
all
true
fifine
and
the
milliner
exchanged
delighted
shrugs
and
grimaces
in
truth
the
small
erect
figure
in
its
perfectly
fitting
gown
bore
no
resemblance
to
the
plain
elderly
miss
philura
of
yesterday
as
for
the
face
beneath
the
nodding
plumes
it
was
actually
radiant
transfigured
with
joy
and
hope
mortimer
van
deuser
regarded
the
apparition
which
greeted
her
at
luncheon
with
open
disapproval
this
new
miss
philura
with
the
prettily
flushed
cheeks
the
bright
eyes
the
fluff
of
waving
hair
and
yes
actually
a
knot
of
fragrant
violets
at
her
breast
had
given
her
an
unpleasant
shock
of
surprise
i
am
sure
i
hope
you
can
all
this
was
her
comment
with
a
deliberate
adjustment
of
eyebrows
and
glasses
calculated
to
add
mordant
point
and
emphasis
to
her
words
oh
yes
replied
miss
philura
tranquilly
but
with
heightened
color
i
can
afford
whatever
i
like
now
van
deuser
stared
hard
at
her
guest
she
found
herself
actually
hesitating
before
philura
rice
then
she
drew
her
massive
figure
to
its
full
height
and
again
bent
the
compelling
light
of
her
glasses
full
upon
the
small
person
of
her
kinswoman
what
er
i
do
not
understand
she
began
lamely
did
you
obtain
the
money
for
all
this
miss
philura
raised
her
eyebrows
ever
so
little
somehow
they
seemed
to
suit
the
clear
blue
eyes
admirably
today
the
money
she
repeated
in
a
tone
of
surprise
why
out
of
the
bank
of
course
upon
the
fact
that
she
had
drawn
out
and
expended
in
a
single
morning
nearly
the
whole
of
the
modest
sum
commonly
made
to
supply
her
meager
living
for
six
months
miss
philura
bestowed
but
a
single
thought
in
the
good
she
said
to
herself
serenely
there
is
plenty
of
money
for
me
why
then
should
i
not
spend
this
chapter
two
the
village
of
innisfield
was
treated
to
a
singular
surprise
on
the
sunday
morning
following
when
miss
philura
rice
newly
returned
from
her
annual
visit
to
boston
walked
down
the
aisle
to
her
accustomed
place
in
the
singers
seat
whispered
comment
and
surmise
flew
from
pew
to
pew
sandwiched
irreverently
between
hymn
prayer
and
sermon
indeed
the
portion
of
the
service
being
of
unusual
length
and
dullness
was
utilized
by
the
female
members
of
the
congregation
in
making
a
minute
inventory
of
the
amazing
changes
which
had
taken
place
in
the
familiar
figure
of
their
townswoman
philury
had
money
left
her
i
should
wonder
her
cousin
van
deuser
been
fixin
her
up
she
to
be
married
were
some
of
the
opinions
wholly
at
variance
with
the
text
of
the
discourse
which
found
their
way
from
mouth
to
mouth
miss
electa
pratt
attached
herself
with
decision
to
her
friend
miss
rice
directly
the
service
was
at
an
end
i
just
to
hear
all
about
it
she
exclaimed
with
a
fond
pressure
of
the
arm
linked
within
her
own
this
after
the
two
ladies
had
extricated
themselves
from
the
circle
of
curious
and
critical
faces
at
the
church
door
miss
philura
surveyed
the
speaker
with
meditative
eyes
it
seemed
to
her
that
miss
pratt
was
curiously
altered
since
she
had
seen
her
last
you
had
a
fortune
left
you
went
on
her
inquisitor
blinking
enviously
at
the
nodding
plumes
which
shaded
miss
philura
blue
eyes
everybody
you
have
and
that
you
are
going
to
get
married
soon
i
sure
you
tell
everything
miss
philura
hesitated
for
a
moment
i
have
exactly
had
money
left
me
she
began
then
her
eyes
brightened
i
have
all
that
i
need
she
said
and
straightened
her
small
figure
confidently
and
you
going
to
be
married
dear
yes
said
miss
philura
distinctly
well
i
philura
rice
almost
screamed
her
companion
do
tell
me
and
is
it
i
can
not
tell
you
that
now
said
miss
philura
simply
he
is
in
she
was
about
to
add
the
encircling
good
but
she
reflected
that
miss
pratt
might
fail
to
comprehend
her
i
will
introduce
you
to
him
later
she
concluded
with
dignity
to
follow
the
fortunes
of
miss
philura
during
the
ensuing
weeks
were
a
pleasant
though
monotonous
task
the
encircling
good
proved
itself
wholly
adequate
to
the
demands
made
upon
it
though
there
was
little
money
in
the
worn
purse
there
were
numerous
and
pressing
invitations
to
tea
to
dinner
and
to
spend
the
day
from
hosts
of
friends
who
had
suddenly
become
warm
affectionate
and
cordially
appreciative
and
not
even
the
new
methodist
minister
wife
could
boast
of
such
lavish
donations
in
the
shape
of
eggs
frosted
cakes
delicate
biscuit
toothsome
crullers
and
choice
fruits
as
found
their
way
to
miss
philura
door
the
recipient
of
these
manifold
favors
walked
as
it
were
upon
air
for
unto
every
one
that
hath
shall
be
given
she
read
in
the
privacy
of
her
own
shabby
little
parlor
and
he
shall
have
abundance
everything
that
i
want
is
mine
cried
the
little
lady
bedewing
the
pages
of
holy
writ
with
happy
tears
the
thought
of
the
lover
and
husband
who
it
is
true
yet
lingered
in
the
invisible
brought
a
becoming
blush
to
her
cheek
i
shall
see
him
soon
she
reflected
tranquilly
he
is
mine
mine
at
that
very
moment
miss
electa
pratt
was
seated
in
the
of
mortimer
van
deuser
residence
in
beacon
street
the
two
ladies
were
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
what
you
tell
me
with
regard
to
philura
fills
me
with
surprise
and
alarm
van
deuser
was
remarking
with
something
more
than
her
accustomed
majesty
of
tone
and
mien
philura
rice
certainly
did
become
engaged
to
be
married
during
her
stay
in
boston
neither
has
she
been
the
recipient
of
funds
from
myself
nor
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
from
any
other
member
of
the
family
personally
i
have
always
been
averse
to
the
encouragement
of
extravagance
and
vanity
in
those
destined
by
a
wise
providence
to
pass
their
lives
in
a
humble
station
i
fear
exceedingly
that
philura
visits
to
boston
have
failed
to
benefit
her
as
i
wished
and
intended
but
she
that
she
had
money
and
that
she
was
going
to
get
married
persisted
miss
pratt
you
do
suppose
lowering
her
strident
tones
to
a
whisper
that
the
poor
thing
is
going
crazy
van
deuser
had
concentrated
her
intellectual
and
penetrating
orbs
upon
a
certain
triangular
knob
that
garnished
the
handle
of
her
visitor
umbrella
she
vouchsafed
no
reply
when
she
did
speak
after
the
lapse
of
some
moments
it
was
to
dismiss
that
worthy
person
with
a
practiced
ease
and
adroitness
which
permitted
of
nothing
further
either
in
the
way
of
information
or
conjecture
philura
is
after
all
a
distant
relative
of
my
own
soliloquized
van
deuser
and
is
entitled
to
consideration
her
subsequent
cogitations
presently
took
shape
to
themselves
and
became
a
letter
dispatched
in
the
evening
mail
and
bearing
the
address
of
the
rev
silas
pettibone
innisfield
van
deuser
recalled
in
this
missive
miss
philura
unfortunate
visit
to
the
ontological
club
and
the
patent
indications
of
its
equally
unfortunate
consequences
i
should
be
inclined
to
take
myself
severely
to
task
in
the
matter
wrote
the
excellent
and
conscientious
lady
if
i
had
not
improved
the
opportunity
to
explain
at
length
in
the
hearing
of
my
misguided
relative
the
nature
and
scope
of
god
controlling
providence
as
signally
displayed
in
his
dealings
with
the
humbler
classes
of
society
as
an
of
the
lowly
flock
to
which
miss
rice
belongs
my
dear
pettibone
i
lay
her
spiritual
state
before
you
and
beg
that
you
will
at
once
endeavor
to
set
right
her
erroneous
views
of
the
overruling
guidance
of
the
supreme
being
i
shall
myself
intercede
for
philura
before
the
throne
of
grace
the
rev
silas
pettibone
read
this
remarkable
communication
with
interest
indeed
after
returning
it
to
its
envelope
and
bestowing
it
in
his
most
inaccessible
the
of
the
lowly
flock
of
innisfield
gave
himself
the
task
of
resurrecting
and
reperusing
the
succinct
yet
weighty
words
of
van
deuser
if
the
rev
silas
had
been
blessed
with
a
wife
to
whose
nimbler
wits
he
might
have
submitted
the
case
it
is
probable
that
he
would
not
have
sat
for
so
long
a
time
in
his
great
chair
brooding
over
the
contents
of
the
envelope
from
boston
but
unfortunately
the
good
minister
had
been
forced
to
lay
his
helpmate
beneath
the
rough
sods
of
the
village
churchyard
some
three
years
previous
since
this
sad
event
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
state
he
had
found
it
essential
to
his
peace
of
mind
to
employ
great
discretion
in
his
dealings
with
the
female
members
of
his
flock
he
viewed
the
matter
in
hand
with
vague
misgivings
strangely
enough
he
had
not
heard
of
miss
philura
good
fortune
and
to
his
masculine
and
impartial
vision
there
had
appeared
no
especial
change
in
the
aspect
or
conduct
of
the
the
little
woman
let
me
think
he
mused
passing
his
white
hand
through
the
thick
dark
locks
just
touched
with
gray
which
shaded
his
perplexed
forehead
he
was
a
personable
man
was
the
rev
silas
pettibone
let
me
think
miss
philura
has
been
very
regular
in
her
attendance
at
church
and
of
late
no
i
have
observed
nothing
wrong
nothing
blameworthy
in
her
walk
and
conversation
but
i
can
not
approve
of
these
ah
clubs
he
again
cast
his
eye
upon
the
letter
ontology
now
is
certainly
not
a
fit
subject
for
the
consideration
of
the
female
mind
having
delivered
himself
of
this
sapient
opinion
the
reverend
gentleman
made
ready
for
a
round
of
parochial
visits
foremost
on
his
list
appeared
the
name
of
miss
philura
rice
as
he
stood
upon
the
shaded
on
either
side
by
fragrant
lilac
plumes
he
resolved
to
be
particularly
brief
though
impressive
in
his
pastoral
ministrations
if
this
especial
member
of
his
flock
had
wandered
from
the
straight
and
narrow
way
into
forbidden
it
was
his
manifest
duty
to
restore
her
in
the
spirit
of
meekness
but
he
would
waste
no
unnecessary
time
or
words
in
the
process
the
sunshine
pleasantly
interrupted
by
snowy
muslin
curtains
streamed
in
through
the
open
windows
of
miss
philura
modest
parlor
kindling
into
scarlet
flame
the
blossoms
of
the
thrifty
geranium
which
stood
upon
the
sill
and
flickered
gently
on
the
brown
head
of
the
little
mistress
of
the
house
seated
with
her
sewing
in
a
favorite
miss
philura
was
unaffectedly
glad
to
see
her
pastor
she
told
him
at
once
that
last
sunday
sermon
was
inspiring
that
she
felt
sure
that
after
hearing
it
the
unconverted
could
hardly
fail
to
be
convinced
of
the
error
of
their
ways
the
rev
silas
pettibone
seated
himself
opposite
miss
philura
and
regarded
her
attentively
the
new
dress
was
undeniably
becoming
the
blue
eyes
under
the
childish
brows
beamed
upon
him
cordially
i
am
pleased
to
learn
ah
that
you
can
approve
the
discourse
of
sabbath
morning
he
began
in
somewhat
labored
fashion
i
have
had
occasion
to
that
is
er
my
attention
has
been
called
of
late
to
the
fact
that
certain
members
of
the
church
have
well
to
put
it
briefly
some
have
fallen
grievously
away
from
the
faith
miss
philura
sympathy
and
concern
were
at
once
apparent
i
do
not
see
she
said
simply
how
one
can
fall
away
from
the
faith
it
is
so
beautiful
to
believe
the
small
upturned
face
shone
with
so
sweet
and
serene
a
light
that
the
of
the
innisfield
flock
leaned
forward
and
fixed
his
earnest
brown
eyes
on
the
clear
blue
eyes
of
the
lady
in
treatises
relating
to
the
affections
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
is
generally
conceded
to
mark
a
crisis
it
marked
a
crisis
on
this
occasion
during
that
moment
the
rev
silas
pettibone
forgot
at
once
and
for
all
time
the
envelope
in
his
pocket
it
was
discovered
six
month
later
and
consigned
to
oblivion
by
but
let
us
not
anticipate
god
is
so
kind
pursued
miss
philura
softly
if
we
once
know
him
as
our
father
we
can
never
again
be
afraid
or
lonely
or
poor
or
lacking
for
any
good
thing
how
is
it
possible
to
fall
away
i
do
not
understand
is
it
not
because
they
do
not
know
him
it
is
altogether
likely
that
the
pastor
of
the
innisfield
presbyterian
church
found
conditions
in
the
spiritual
state
of
miss
philura
which
necessitated
earnest
and
prolonged
admonition
at
all
events
the
sun
was
sinking
behind
the
western
horizon
when
the
reverend
gentleman
slowly
and
thoughtfully
made
his
way
toward
the
parsonage
curiously
enough
this
highly
respectable
domicile
had
taken
on
during
his
absence
an
aspect
of
gloom
and
loneliness
unpleasantly
apparent
a
scarlet
geranium
in
the
window
might
improve
it
thought
the
vaguely
dissatisfied
proprietor
as
he
put
on
his
and
thrust
his
feet
into
his
newest
pair
of
slippers
presented
by
miss
electa
pratt
to
my
pastor
with
grateful
affection
i
believe
i
failed
to
draw
miss
philura
attention
to
the
obvious
relation
between
faith
and
works
cogitated
the
reverend
silas
as
he
sat
before
his
lonely
hearth
placidly
scorching
the
soles
of
his
new
slippers
before
the
cheerful
blaze
it
will
be
altogether
advisable
i
think
to
set
her
right
on
that
point
without
delay
i
will
ah
just
look
in
again
for
a
moment
afternoon
god
purposes
will
ripen
fast
unfolding
every
hour
the
bud
may
have
a
bitter
taste
but
sweet
will
be
the
flower
sang
the
choir
of
the
innisfield
presbyterian
church
one
sunday
morning
a
month
later
and
miss
philura
rice
as
was
afterward
remarked
sang
the
words
with
such
enthusiasm
and
earnestness
that
her
high
soprano
soared
quite
above
all
the
other
voices
in
the
choir
and
this
despite
the
fact
that
miss
electa
pratt
was
putting
forth
her
nasal
contralto
with
more
than
wonted
insistence
the
lady
found
the
sermon
on
the
text
little
children
love
one
another
for
love
is
of
god
so
extremely
convincing
and
her
own
subsequent
spiritual
state
in
such
an
agitated
condition
that
she
took
occasion
to
seek
a
private
conversation
with
her
pastor
in
his
study
on
that
same
sunday
afternoon
i
do
know
i
been
so
wrought
up
declared
miss
pratt
with
a
preliminary
display
of
immaculate
handkerchief
i
cried
after
i
got
home
from
church
this
morning
ma
she
sez
to
me
sez
she
ails
you
lecty
and
i
sez
to
ma
sez
i
it
was
that
sermon
i
do
know
i
ever
heard
anything
like
it
that
dear
pastor
of
ours
is
just
ripening
for
a
better
world
miss
electa
paused
a
moment
to
shed
copious
tears
over
this
statement
it
does
seem
to
me
pettibone
she
resumed
with
a
tender
glance
and
a
comprehensive
sniff
that
you
ai
looking
as
well
as
usual
i
said
so
to
philura
rice
as
we
was
coming
out
of
church
and
i
really
hate
to
tell
you
how
she
answered
me
only
i
feel
as
though
it
was
my
duty
pettibone
is
perfectly
well
she
says
and
tossed
those
feathers
of
hers
ever
philura
awful
worldly
i
to
say
not
i
been
for
some
time
that
it
was
my
christian
duty
however
painful
to
tell
you
what
mis
van
deuser
of
boston
said
about
the
rev
silas
pettibone
frowned
with
awful
dignity
he
brought
down
his
closed
fist
upon
his
open
bible
with
forensic
force
and
suddenness
miss
philura
rice
he
said
emphatically
is
one
of
the
most
spiritual
the
most
lovely
and
consistent
christian
characters
it
has
ever
been
my
privilege
to
know
her
faith
and
unworldliness
are
absolutely
beyond
the
comprehension
of
of
many
of
my
flock
i
must
further
tell
you
that
i
hope
to
have
the
great
happiness
of
leading
miss
rice
to
the
matrimonial
altar
in
the
near
future
miss
electa
pratt
sank
back
in
her
chair
petrified
with
astonishment
well
i
she
gasped
and
she
was
engaged
to
you
this
and
i
never
knew
it
the
rev
pettibone
bent
his
eyes
coldly
upon
his
agitated
parishioner
i
am
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
your
very
strange
comment
miss
pratt
he
said
the
engagement
has
been
of
such
very
short
duration
that
i
can
not
regard
it
as
surprising
that
you
should
not
have
heard
of
it
it
ah
took
place
only
yesterday
miss
electa
straightened
her
angular
shoulders
with
a
jerk
yesterday
she
almost
screamed
well
i
can
tell
that
philura
rice
told
that
she
was
engaged
to
be
married
more
than
three
months
ago
you
are
certainly
mistaken
madam
began
the
minister
in
a
somewhat
perturbed
tone
which
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
the
now
flushed
and
triumphant
spinster
more
than
three
months
ago
she
repeated
with
incisive
emphasis
maybe
you
listen
to
me
while
i
tell
you
what
i
know
about
philura
rice
but
the
lady
had
reckoned
without
her
host
the
rev
silas
arose
to
his
feet
with
decision
i
certainly
will
listen
to
anything
derogatory
to
miss
rice
he
said
sternly
she
is
my
promised
wife
you
will
remember
with
that
the
prudent
minister
beat
a
hasty
retreat
to
entrench
himself
without
apology
or
delay
in
the
inner
fastnesses
of
the
parsonage
miss
electa
rolled
her
greenish
orbs
about
the
chamber
of
learning
with
a
thoughtful
smile
if
philura
rice
ai
crazy
she
said
aloud
i
guess
she
ai
far
from
it
she
told
a
wicked
lie
in
either
case
it
my
christian
duty
to
see
this
thing
put
a
stop
to
that
evening
after
service
miss
philura
her
modest
cheeks
dyed
with
painful
blushes
confessed
to
her
promised
husband
that
she
had
indeed
announced
her
intentions
of
matrimony
some
three
months
previous
i
wanted
somebody
to
to
love
me
she
faltered
somebody
in
particular
you
know
and
and
i
asked
god
to
give
me
a
a
husband
after
i
had
asked
of
course
i
that
he
he
was
already
in
the
encircling
good
you
know
or
i
should
not
have
wanted
him
when
electa
asked
me
point
blank
what
could
i
say
without
without
denying
the
brave
voice
faltered
more
than
once
during
this
recital
and
finally
broke
down
altogether
when
the
rev
silas
pettibone
his
brown
eyes
shining
exclaimed
in
joyful
yet
solemn
tones
and
god
sent
me
the
encircling
good
was
perfectly
manifest
at
that
moment
in
the
shape
of
two
strong
arms
miss
philura
rested
in
them
and
was
glad
