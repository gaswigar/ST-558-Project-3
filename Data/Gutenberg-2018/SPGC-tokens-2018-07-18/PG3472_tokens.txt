chapter
i
dirty
work
at
the
border
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
tale
there
comes
a
moment
of
puzzled
hesitation
one
way
of
approach
is
set
beside
another
for
choice
and
a
third
contrived
for
better
choice
still
the
puzzle
persists
all
because
the
one
precisely
right
way
might
seem
shall
we
say
intense
high
keyed
clamorous
yet
if
one
way
is
the
only
right
way
why
pause
courage
slightly
dazed
though
certain
let
us
be
on
into
the
shrill
thick
of
it
so
then
out
there
in
the
great
open
spaces
where
men
are
men
a
clash
of
primitive
hearts
and
the
coming
of
young
love
into
its
own
well
had
it
been
for
estelle
clair
if
she
had
not
wandered
from
the
fordyce
ranch
a
moment
s
delay
in
the
arrival
of
buck
benson
a
second
of
fear
in
that
brave
heart
and
hers
would
have
been
a
fate
worse
than
death
had
she
not
been
warned
of
snake
le
vasquez
the
outlaw
his
base
threat
to
win
her
by
fair
means
or
foul
had
not
buck
benson
himself
that
strong
silent
man
of
the
open
begged
her
to
beware
of
the
perhaps
she
had
resented
the
hint
of
mastery
in
benson
s
cool
quiet
tones
as
he
said
miss
clair
ma
am
i
beg
you
not
to
endanger
your
welfare
by
permitting
the
advances
of
this
viper
he
bodes
no
good
to
such
as
perhaps
who
knows
estelle
clair
had
even
thought
to
trifle
with
the
feelings
of
snake
le
vasquez
then
to
scorn
him
for
his
presumption
although
the
beautiful
new
york
society
girl
had
remained
unsullied
in
the
midst
of
a
city
s
profligacy
she
still
liked
to
play
with
fire
as
she
laughingly
said
and
at
the
quiet
words
of
benson
benson
his
comrades
of
the
border
called
him
she
had
drawn
herself
to
her
full
height
facing
him
in
all
her
blond
young
beauty
and
pouted
adorably
as
she
replied
thank
you
but
i
can
look
out
for
yet
she
had
wandered
on
her
pony
farther
than
she
meant
to
and
was
not
without
trepidation
at
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
picturesque
halfbreed
his
teeth
flashing
in
an
evil
smile
as
he
swept
off
his
broad
sombrero
to
her
above
her
suddenly
beating
heart
she
sought
to
chat
gayly
while
the
quick
eyes
of
the
outlaw
took
in
the
details
of
the
smart
riding
costume
that
revealed
every
line
of
her
lithe
young
figure
but
suddenly
she
chilled
under
his
hot
glance
that
now
spoke
all
too
plainly
i
must
return
to
my
friends
she
faltered
they
will
be
but
the
fellow
laughed
with
a
sinister
leer
no
ah
no
the
lovely
senorita
will
come
with
me
he
replied
but
there
was
the
temper
of
steel
in
his
words
for
snake
le
vasquez
on
the
border
where
human
life
was
lightly
held
was
known
as
the
slimy
viper
of
all
the
evil
men
in
that
inferno
snake
was
the
foulest
steeped
in
vice
he
feared
neither
god
nor
man
and
respected
no
woman
and
now
estelle
clair
pet
pampered
darling
of
new
york
society
which
she
ruled
with
an
iron
hand
from
her
father
s
fifth
avenue
mansion
regretted
bitterly
that
she
had
not
given
heed
to
honest
buck
benson
her
prayers
threats
entreaties
were
in
vain
despite
her
struggles
the
blows
her
small
fists
rained
upon
the
scoundrel
s
taunting
face
she
was
borne
across
the
border
on
over
the
mesa
toward
the
lair
of
the
outlaw
have
you
no
mercy
she
cried
again
and
again
can
you
not
see
that
i
loathe
and
despise
you
foul
fiend
that
you
are
ah
god
in
heaven
is
there
no
help
at
hand
the
outlaw
remained
deaf
to
these
words
that
should
have
melted
a
heart
of
stone
at
last
over
the
burning
plain
was
seen
the
ruined
hovel
to
which
the
scoundrel
was
dragging
his
fair
burden
it
was
but
the
work
of
a
moment
to
dismount
and
bear
her
form
within
the
den
there
he
faced
her
repellent
with
evil
intentions
ha
senorita
you
are
a
beautiful
wildcat
yes
but
snake
le
vasquez
will
tame
you
ha
ha
laughed
he
carelessly
with
a
swift
movement
the
beautiful
girl
sought
to
withdraw
the
small
revolver
without
which
she
never
left
the
ranch
but
snake
le
vasquez
with
a
muttered
oath
was
too
quick
for
her
he
seized
the
toy
and
contemptuously
hurled
it
across
his
vile
den
have
a
care
my
proud
beauty
he
snarled
and
the
next
moment
she
was
writhing
in
his
grasp
little
availed
her
puny
strength
helpless
as
an
infant
was
the
fair
new
york
society
girl
as
snake
le
vasquez
foulest
of
the
viper
breed
began
to
force
his
attention
upon
her
the
creature
s
hot
kisses
seared
her
defenseless
cheek
listen
he
hissed
you
are
mine
mine
at
last
here
you
shall
remain
a
prisoner
until
you
have
consented
to
be
my
all
seemed
indeed
lost
am
i
too
late
miss
clair
snake
le
vasquez
started
at
the
quiet
grim
voice
sapristi
he
snarled
you
me
replied
buck
benson
for
it
was
indeed
no
other
thank
god
at
last
murmured
estelle
clair
freeing
herself
from
the
foul
arms
that
had
enfolded
her
slim
young
beauty
and
staggering
back
from
him
who
would
so
basely
have
forced
her
into
a
distasteful
marriage
in
an
instant
she
had
recovered
the
clair
poise
had
become
every
inch
the
new
york
society
leader
as
she
replied
not
too
late
benson
just
in
time
rather
ha
ha
this
this
gentleman
has
become
annoying
you
are
just
in
time
to
mete
out
the
punishment
he
so
justly
deserves
for
which
i
shall
pray
that
heaven
reward
she
pointed
an
accusing
finger
at
the
craven
wretch
who
had
shrunk
from
her
and
now
cowered
at
the
far
side
of
the
wretched
den
at
that
moment
she
was
strangely
thrilled
what
was
his
power
this
strong
silent
man
of
the
open
with
his
deep
reverence
for
pure
american
womanhood
true
her
culture
demanded
a
gentleman
but
her
heart
demanded
a
man
her
eyes
softened
and
fell
before
his
cool
keen
gaze
and
a
blush
mantled
her
fair
cheek
could
he
but
have
known
it
she
stood
then
in
meek
surrender
before
this
master
a
tremor
swept
the
honest
rugged
face
of
buck
benson
as
heart
thus
called
to
heart
but
his
keen
eyes
flitted
to
snake
le
vasquez
now
curse
you
viper
that
you
are
you
shall
fight
me
by
heaven
in
american
fashion
man
to
man
for
foul
though
you
be
i
hesitate
to
put
a
bullet
through
your
craven
the
beautiful
girl
shivered
with
new
apprehension
the
eyes
of
snake
le
vasquez
glittered
with
new
hope
he
faced
his
steely
eyed
opponent
for
an
instant
only
then
with
a
snarl
like
that
of
an
angry
beast
sprang
upon
him
benson
met
the
cowardly
attack
with
the
flash
of
a
powerful
fist
and
the
outlaw
fell
to
the
floor
with
a
hoarse
cry
of
rage
and
pain
but
he
was
quickly
upon
his
feet
again
muttering
curses
and
again
he
attacked
his
antagonist
quick
blows
rained
upon
his
defenseless
face
for
the
strong
silent
man
was
now
fairly
aroused
he
fought
like
a
demon
perhaps
divining
that
here
strong
men
battled
for
a
good
woman
s
love
the
outlaw
was
proving
to
be
no
match
for
his
opponent
arising
from
the
ground
where
a
mighty
blow
had
sent
him
he
made
a
effort
to
recover
the
knife
which
benson
had
taken
from
him
have
a
care
cried
the
girl
in
quick
alarm
that
fiend
in
human
form
would
murder
you
but
buck
benson
s
cool
eye
had
seen
the
treachery
in
ample
time
with
a
muttered
curse
you
fiend
that
you
are
he
seized
the
form
of
the
outlaw
in
a
powerful
grasp
raised
him
high
aloft
as
if
he
had
been
but
a
child
and
was
about
to
dash
him
to
the
ground
when
a
new
voice
from
the
doorway
froze
him
to
immobility
he
stood
there
holding
aloft
the
now
still
form
of
snake
le
vasquez
the
voice
from
the
doorway
betrayed
deep
amazement
and
the
profoundest
irritation
merton
gill
what
in
the
sacred
name
of
time
are
you
meanin
to
do
with
that
dummy
for
the
good
land
s
sake
have
you
gone
plumb
crazy
or
what
put
that
thing
down
the
newcomer
was
a
portly
man
of
middle
age
dressed
in
black
his
gray
hair
grew
low
upon
his
brow
and
he
wore
a
parted
beard
the
conqueror
of
snake
le
vasquez
was
still
frozen
though
he
had
instantly
ceased
to
be
buck
benson
the
strong
silent
man
of
the
open
spaces
the
irritated
voice
came
again

dummy

raincoats

and
then

after
a
few
customers
i
declare
sometimes
i
git
clean
out
of
patience
with
you
now
for
gosh
s
sake
stir
your
stumps
oh
all
right
yes
sir
replied
merton
gill
though
but
half
respectfully
the
oh
all
right
had
been
tainted
with
a
trace
of
sullenness
he
was
tired
of
this
continual
nagging
and
fussing
over
small
matters
some
day
he
would
tell
the
old
grouch
so
and
now
gone
the
vivid
tale
of
the
great
the
wide
plains
of
the
west
the
clash
of
men
for
a
good
woman
s
love
gone
perhaps
the
greatest
heart
picture
of
a
generation
the
picture
at
which
you
laugh
with
a
lump
in
your
throat
and
smile
with
a
tear
in
your
eye
the
story
of
plausible
punches
a
big
vital
theme
masterfully
handled
thrills
action
beauty
excitement
carried
to
a
sensational
finish
by
the
genius
of
that
sterling
star
of
the
shadowed
world
clifford
armytage
once
known
as
merton
gill
in
the
little
hamlet
of
simsbury
illinois
where
for
a
time
ere
yet
he
was
called
to
screen
triumphs
he
served
as
a
humble
clerk
in
the
emporium
of
amos
gashwiler
everything
for
the
home
our
prices
always
right
merton
gill
so
for
a
little
time
he
must
still
be
known
moodily
seized
the
late
estelle
clair
under
his
arm
and
withdrew
from
the
dingy
back
storeroom
down
between
the
counters
of
the
emporium
he
went
with
his
fair
burden
and
left
her
outside
its
portals
staring
from
her
very
definitely
lashed
eyes
across
the
slumbering
street
at
the
simsbury
post
office
she
was
tastefully
arrayed
in
one
of
those
new
checked
gingham
house
frocks
so
heatedly
mentioned
a
moment
since
by
her
lawful
owner
and
across
her
chest
merton
gill
now
imposed
with
no
tenderness
of
manner
the
appealing
legend
our
latest
for
milady
only
he
returned
for
snake
le
vasquez
that
outlaw
s
face
even
out
of
the
picture
was
evil
he
had
been
picked
for
the
part
because
of
this
face
plump
pinkly
tinted
cheeks
lustrous
curling
hair
of
some
repellent
composition
eyes
with
a
hard
glitter
each
lash
distinct
in
lines
and
a
small
black
mustache
that
lent
the
whole
an
offensive
smirk
garbed
now
in
a
raincoat
he
too
was
posed
before
the
emporium
front
labelled
rainproof
or
you
get
back
your
so
frankly
evil
was
his
mien
that
merton
gill
pausing
to
regard
him
suffered
a
brief
relapse
into
artistry
you
fiend
he
muttered
and
contemptuously
smote
the
cynical
face
with
an
open
hand
snake
le
vasquez
remained
indifferent
to
the
affront
smirking
insufferably
across
the
slumbering
street
at
the
wooden
indian
proffering
cigars
before
the
establishment
of
selby
brothers
confectionery
and
tobaccos
within
the
emporium
the
proprietor
now
purveyed
hooks
and
eyes
to
an
impatient
leffingwell
merton
gill
behind
the
opposite
counter
waited
upon
a
little
girl
sent
for
two
and
a
quarter
yards
of
stuff
to
match
the
sample
crumpled
in
her
damp
hand
over
the
suave
amenities
of
this
merchandising
amos
gashwiler
glared
suspiciously
across
the
store
at
his
employee
their
relations
were
still
strained
merton
also
glared
at
amos
but
discreetly
at
moments
when
the
other
s
back
was
turned
or
when
he
was
blandly
wishing
to
know
of
leffingwell
if
there
would
be
something
else
other
customers
entered
trade
was
on
both
merton
and
amos
wore
airs
of
cheerful
briskness
that
deceived
the
public
no
one
could
have
thought
that
amos
was
fearing
his
undoubtedly
crazed
clerk
might
become
uncontrollable
at
any
moment
or
that
the
clerk
was
mentally
parting
from
amos
forever
in
a
scene
of
tense
dramatic
value
in
which
his
few
dignified
but
scathing
words
would
burn
themselves
unforgettably
into
the
old
man
s
brain
merton
to
himself
had
often
told
amos
these
things
some
day
he
d
say
them
right
out
leaving
his
victim
not
only
in
the
utmost
confusion
but
in
black
despair
of
ever
finding
another
clerk
one
half
as
efficient
as
merton
gill
the
afternoon
wore
to
closing
time
in
a
flurry
of
trade
during
which
as
merton
continued
to
behave
sanely
the
apprehension
of
his
employer
in
a
measure
subsided
the
last
customer
had
departed
from
the
emporium
the
dummies
were
brought
inside
the
dust
curtains
were
hung
along
the
shelves
of
dry
goods
there
remained
for
merton
only
the
task
of
delivering
a
few
groceries
he
gathered
these
and
took
them
out
to
the
wagon
in
front
then
he
changed
from
his
store
coat
to
his
street
coat
and
donned
a
rakish
plush
hat
amos
was
also
changing
from
his
store
coat
to
his
street
coat
and
donning
his
frayed
straw
hat
see
if
you
can
t
keep
from
actin
crazy
while
you
make
them
deliveries
said
amos
not
uncordially
as
he
lighted
a
choice
cigar
from
the
box
which
he
kept
hidden
under
a
counter
merton
wished
to
reply
see
here
gashwiler
i
ve
stood
this
abuse
long
enough
the
time
has
come
to
say
a
few
words
to
you
but
aloud
he
merely
responded
yes
sir
the
circumstance
that
he
also
had
a
cigar
from
the
same
box
hidden
not
so
well
as
amos
thought
may
have
subdued
his
resentment
he
would
light
the
cigar
after
the
first
turn
in
the
road
had
carried
him
beyond
the
eagle
eye
of
its
owner
the
delivery
wagon
outside
was
drawn
by
an
elderly
horse
devoid
of
ambition
or
ideals
his
head
was
sunk
in
dejection
he
was
gray
at
the
temples
and
slouched
in
the
shafts
in
a
loafing
attitude
one
forefoot
negligently
crossed
in
front
of
the
other
he
aroused
himself
reluctantly
and
with
apparent
difficulty
when
merton
gill
seized
the
reins
and
called
in
commanding
tones
get
on
there
you
old
skate
the
equipage
moved
off
under
the
gaze
of
amos
who
was
locking
the
doors
of
his
establishment
turning
the
first
corner
into
a
dusty
side
street
merton
dropped
the
reins
and
lighted
the
filched
cigar
other
gashwiler
property
was
sacred
to
him
from
all
the
emporium
s
choice
stock
he
would
have
abstracted
not
so
much
as
a
pin
but
the
gashwiler
cigars
said
to
be
the
world
s
best
smoke
with
the
picture
of
a
dissipated
clubman
in
evening
dress
on
the
box
cover
were
different
in
that
they
were
pointedly
hidden
from
merton
he
cared
little
for
cigars
but
this
was
a
challenge
the
old
boy
couldn
t
get
away
with
anything
like
that
if
he
didn
t
want
his
cigars
touched
let
him
leave
the
box
out
in
the
open
like
a
man
merton
drew
upon
the
lighted
trophy
moistened
and
pasted
back
the
wrapper
that
had
broken
when
the
end
was
bitten
off
and
took
from
the
bottom
of
the
delivery
wagon
the
remains
of
a
buggy
whip
that
had
been
worn
to
half
its
length
with
this
he
now
tickled
the
bony
ridges
of
the
horse
blows
meant
nothing
to
dexter
but
he
could
still
be
tickled
into
brief
spurts
of
activity
he
trotted
with
swaying
head
sending
up
an
effective
dust
screen
between
the
wagon
and
a
still
possibly
observing
gashwiler
his
deliveries
made
merton
again
tickled
the
horse
to
a
frantic
pace
which
continued
until
they
neared
the
alley
on
which
fronted
the
gashwiler
barn
there
the
speed
was
moderated
to
a
mild
amble
for
gashwiler
believed
his
horse
should
be
driven
with
tenderness
and
his
equally
watchful
wife
believed
it
would
run
away
if
given
the
chance
merton
drove
into
the
barnyard
unhitched
the
horse
watered
it
at
the
half
of
a
barrel
before
the
iron
pump
and
led
it
into
the
barn
where
he
removed
the
harness
the
old
horse
sighed
noisily
and
shook
himself
with
relief
as
the
bridle
was
removed
and
a
halter
slipped
over
his
venerable
brow
ascertaining
that
the
barnyard
was
vacant
merton
immediately
became
attentive
to
his
charge
throughout
the
late
drive
his
attitude
had
been
one
of
mild
but
contemptuous
abuse
more
than
once
he
had
uttered
the
words
old
skate
in
tones
of
earnest
conviction
and
with
the
worn
end
of
the
whip
he
had
cruelly
tickled
the
still
absurdly
sensitive
sides
had
beating
availed
he
would
with
no
compunction
have
beaten
the
drooping
wreck
but
now
all
at
once
he
was
curiously
tender
he
patted
the
shoulder
softly
put
both
arms
around
the
bony
neck
and
pressed
his
face
against
the
face
of
dexter
a
moment
he
stood
thus
then
spoke
in
a
voice
old
pal
the
best
the
truest
pal
a
man
ever
had
you
and
me
has
seen
some
tough
times
old
pard
but
you
ve
allus
brought
me
through
without
a
scratch
allus
brought
me
there
was
a
sob
in
the
speaker
s
voice
but
he
manfully
recovered
a
clear
tone
of
pathos
and
now
old
pal
they
re
ye
from
me
yes
we
got
to
part
you
an
me
i

never
goin

we
got
to
be
brave
old

we
got
to
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
no
cryin
now
no
bustin
the
speaker
unclasped
his
arms
and
stood
with
head
bowed
his
face
working
curiously
striving
to
hold
back
the
sobs
for
merton
gill

once
more
clifford

idol
of
the

in
his
great
role
of
buck
benson
bidding
the
accustomed
farewell
to
his

that
had
brought
him
safely
through
countless
dangers
how
are

that
in
another

of

from
a
window
of
the

onto
the
back
of
his

his

is
proved
by

demanded

merton
chapter
ii
that
night
the
apartments
of
clifford
armytage
merton
gill
mealed
at
the
gashwiler
home
he
ate
his
supper
in
moody
silence
holding
himself
above
the
small
gossip
of
the
day
that
engaged
amos
and
his
wife
what
to
him
meant
the
announcement
that
amos
expected
a
new
line
of
white
goods
on
the
morrow
or
gashwiler
s
version
of
a
regrettable
incident
occurring
at
that
afternoon
s
meeting
of
the
entre
nous
five
hundred
club
in
which
the
score
had
been
juggled
adversely
to
gashwiler
resulting
in
the
loss
of
the
first
prize
a
handsome
fern
dish
and
concerning
which
gashwiler
had
thought
it
best
to
speak
her
mind
what
importance
could
he
attach
to
the
disclosure
of
metta
judson
the
gashwiler
hired
girl
who
chatted
freely
during
her
appearances
with
food
that
doc
cummins
had
said
old
grandma
foutz
couldn
t
last
out
another
day
that
the
peter
swansons
were
sending
clear
to
chicago
for
tilda
s
trousseau
and
that
jeff
murdock
had
arrested
one
of
the
giddings
boys
but
she
couldn
t
learn
if
it
was
ferd
or
gus
for
being
drunk
as
a
fool
and
busting
up
a
bazaar
out
at
the
oak
grove
schoolhouse
and
the
fighting
was
something
terrible
scarcely
did
he
listen
to
these
petty
recitals
he
ate
in
silence
and
when
he
had
finished
the
simple
meal
he
begged
to
be
excused
he
begged
this
in
a
lofty
detached
somewhat
weary
manner
as
a
man
of
the
world
excessively
bored
at
the
dull
chatter
but
still
the
fastidious
gentleman
might
have
begged
it
breaking
into
one
of
the
many
repetitions
by
his
hostess
of
just
what
she
had
said
to
judge
ellis
he
was
again
clifford
armytage
enacting
a
polished
society
man
among
yokels
he
was
so
impressive
after
rising
in
his
bow
to
gashwiler
that
amos
regarded
him
with
a
kindling
suspicion
say
he
called
as
merton
in
the
hallway
plucked
his
rakish
plush
hat
from
the
mirrored
rack
you
remember
now
no
more
o
that
skylarkin
with
them
dummies
them
things
cost
merton
paused
he
wished
to
laugh
sarcastically
a
laugh
of
withering
scorn
he
wished
to
reply
in
polished
tones
skylarkin
you
poor
dull
clod
what
do
you
know
of
my
ambitions
my
ideals
you
with
your
petty
life
devoted
to
gaining
a
few
paltry
dollars
but
he
did
not
say
this
or
even
register
the
emotion
that
would
justly
accompany
such
a
subtitle
he
merely
rejoined
all
right
sir
i
m
not
going
to
touch
them
and
went
quickly
out
darned
old
grouch
he
muttered
as
he
went
down
the
concrete
walk
to
the
gashwiler
front
gate
here
he
turned
to
regard
the
brick
house
and
the
square
of
lawn
with
a
concrete
deer
on
one
side
of
the
walk
balanced
by
a
concrete
deer
on
the
other
before
the
gate
was
the
effigy
of
a
small
negro
in
fantastic
uniform
holding
an
iron
ring
aloft
the
gashwiler
carriage
horse
had
been
tethered
to
this
in
the
days
before
the
gashwiler
touring
car
had
been
acquired
dwelling
of
a
country
storekeeper
muttered
merton
that
s
all
you
are
this
was
intended
to
be
scornful
merton
meant
that
on
the
screen
it
would
be
recognized
as
this
and
nothing
more
it
could
not
be
taken
for
the
mansion
of
a
rich
banker
or
the
country
home
of
a
wall
street
magnate
he
felt
that
he
had
been
keen
in
his
dispraise
especially
as
old
gashwiler
would
never
get
the
sting
of
it
clod
three
blocks
brought
him
to
the
heart
of
the
town
still
throbbing
faintly
he
stood
irresolute
before
the
giddings
house
chairs
in
front
of
this
hostelry
were
now
vacant
of
loafers
and
a
clatter
of
dishes
came
through
the
open
windows
of
the
dining
room
where
supper
was
on
farther
down
the
street
selby
brothers
cigars
and
confectionery
would
be
open
lights
shone
from
the
windows
of
the
fashion
pool
parlour
across
the
way
the
city
drug
store
could
still
be
entered
and
the
post
office
would
stay
open
until
after
the
mail
from
no
was
distributed
with
these
exceptions
the
shops
along
this
mart
of
trade
were
tightly
closed
including
the
gashwiler
emporium
at
the
blind
front
of
which
merton
now
glanced
with
the
utmost
distaste
such
citizens
as
were
yet
abroad
would
be
over
at
the
depot
to
watch
no
go
through
merton
debated
joining
these
simsbury
was
too
small
to
be
noticed
by
many
trains
it
sprawled
along
the
track
as
if
it
had
been
an
afterthought
of
the
railroad
trains
like
no
were
apt
to
dash
relentlessly
by
it
without
slackening
speed
the
mail
bag
being
flung
to
the
depot
platform
but
sometimes
there
would
be
a
passenger
for
simsbury
and
the
proud
train
would
slow
down
and
halt
reluctantly
with
a
grinding
of
brakes
while
the
passenger
alighted
then
a
good
view
of
the
train
could
be
had
a
line
of
beautiful
sleepers
terminating
in
an
observation
car
its
rear
platform
guarded
by
a
railing
behind
which
the
privileged
lolled
at
ease
and
up
ahead
a
wonderful
dining
car
where
dinner
was
being
served
flitting
waiters
the
glitter
of
silver
and
crystal
and
damask
and
favoured
beings
feasting
at
their
lordly
ease
perhaps
denying
even
a
careless
glance
at
the
pitiful
hamlet
outside
or
at
most
looking
out
impatient
at
the
halt
or
merely
staring
with
incurious
eyes
while
awaiting
their
choice
foods
not
one
of
these
enviable
persons
ever
betrayed
any
interest
in
simsbury
or
its
little
group
of
citizens
who
daily
gathered
on
the
platform
to
do
them
honour
merton
gill
used
to
fancy
that
these
people
might
shrewdly
detect
him
to
be
out
of
place
there
might
perhaps
take
him
to
be
an
alien
city
man
awaiting
a
similar
proud
train
going
the
other
way
standing
as
he
would
aloof
from
the
obvious
villagers
and
having
a
manner
a
carriage
an
attire
such
as
further
set
him
apart
still
he
could
never
be
sure
about
this
perhaps
no
one
ever
did
single
him
out
as
a
being
patently
of
the
greater
world
perhaps
they
considered
that
he
was
rightly
of
simsbury
and
would
continue
to
be
a
part
of
it
all
the
days
of
his
life
or
perhaps
they
wouldn
t
notice
him
at
all
they
had
been
passing
simsburys
all
day
and
all
simsburys
and
all
their
peoples
must
look
very
much
alike
to
them
very
well
a
day
would
come
there
would
be
at
simsbury
a
momentous
stop
of
no
and
another
passenger
would
be
in
that
dining
car
disjoined
forever
from
simsbury
and
he
with
them
would
stare
out
the
polished
windows
at
the
gaping
throng
and
he
would
continue
to
stare
with
incurious
eyes
at
still
other
simsburys
along
the
right
of
way
while
the
proud
train
bore
him
off
to
triumphs
never
dreamed
of
by
villagers
he
decided
now
not
to
tantalize
himself
with
a
glance
at
this
splendid
means
of
escape
from
all
that
was
sordid
he
was
still
not
a
little
depressed
by
the
late
unpleasantness
with
gashwiler
who
had
thought
him
a
crazy
fool
with
his
revolver
his
fiercely
muttered
words
and
his
holding
aloft
of
a
valuable
dummy
as
if
to
threaten
it
with
destruction
well
some
day
the
old
grouch
would
eat
his
words
some
day
he
would
be
relating
to
amazed
listeners
that
he
had
known
merton
gill
intimately
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
astounding
career
that
was
bound
to
come
but
merton
had
no
heart
for
the
swift
spectacle
of
no
nor
even
should
it
halt
did
he
feel
up
to
watching
those
indifferent
incurious
passengers
who
little
recked
that
a
future
screen
idol
in
natty
plush
hat
and
belted
coat
amusedly
surveyed
them
he
must
be
alone
but
a
day
would
come
resistless
time
would
strike
his
hour
still
he
must
wait
for
the
mail
before
beginning
his
nightly
study
certain
of
his
magazines
would
come
he
sauntered
down
the
deserted
street
pausing
before
the
establishment
of
selby
brothers
from
the
door
of
this
emerged
one
elmer
huff
clerk
at
the
city
drug
store
elmer
had
purchased
a
package
of
cigarettes
and
now
offered
one
to
merton
lo
mert
have
a
little
pill
no
thanks
replied
merton
firmly
he
had
lately
given
up
smoking
save
those
clandestine
indulgences
at
the
expense
of
gashwiler
because
he
was
saving
money
against
his
great
day
elmer
lighted
one
of
his
own
little
pills
and
made
a
further
suggestion
say
how
about
settin
in
a
little
game
with
the
gang
after
the
store
closes
limit
no
thanks
replied
merton
again
firmly
he
had
no
great
liking
for
poker
at
any
limit
and
he
would
not
subject
his
savings
to
a
senseless
hazard
of
course
he
might
win
but
you
never
could
tell
do
you
good
urged
elmer
quit
at
twelve
sharp
with
one
round
of
no
i
guess
not
said
merton
we
had
some
game
last
night
i
ll
tell
the
world
one
hand
we
had
four
jacks
out
against
four
aces
and
right
after
that
i
held
four
kings
against
an
ace
full
say
one
time
there
i
was
about
to
the
good
but
i
didn
t
have
enough
sense
to
quit
hear
about
gus
giddings
they
got
him
over
in
the
coop
for
breaking
in
on
a
social
out
at
the
oak
grove
schoolhouse
last
night
say
he
had
a
peach
on
when
he
left
here
i
ll
tell
the
world
but
he
didn
t
get
far
them
grove
lads
certainly
made
a
believer
out
of
him
you
ought
to
see
that
left
eye
of
his
merton
listened
loftily
to
this
village
talk
gossip
of
a
rural
sport
who
got
a
peach
on
and
started
something
and
the
poker
game
in
the
back
room
of
the
city
drug
store
what
diversions
were
these
for
one
who
had
a
future
let
these
clods
live
out
their
dull
lives
in
their
own
way
but
not
merton
gill
who
held
aloof
from
their
low
sports
studied
faithfully
the
lessons
in
his
course
and
patiently
bided
his
time
he
presently
sauntered
to
the
post
office
where
the
mail
was
being
distributed
here
he
found
the
who
had
returned
from
the
treat
of
no
s
flight
and
many
of
the
less
enterprising
citizens
who
had
merely
come
down
for
their
mail
gashwiler
was
among
these
smoking
one
of
his
choice
cigars
he
was
not
allowed
to
smoke
in
the
house
merton
knowing
this
prohibition
strictly
enforced
by
gashwiler
threw
his
employer
a
glance
of
honest
pity
briefly
he
permitted
himself
a
vision
of
his
own
future
home
a
palatial
bungalow
in
distant
hollywood
with
expensive
cigars
in
elaborate
humidors
and
costly
cigarettes
in
silver
things
on
low
tables
one
might
smoke
freely
there
in
every
room
under
more
of
the
elmer
huff
sort
of
gossip
and
the
rhythmic
clump
of
the
cancelling
stamp
back
of
the
drawers
and
boxes
he
allowed
himself
a
further
glimpse
of
this
luxurious
interior
he
sat
on
a
low
couch
among
soft
cushions
a
magnificent
bearskin
rug
beneath
his
feet
he
smoked
one
of
the
costly
cigarettes
and
chatted
with
a
young
lady
interviewer
from
photo
land
you
ask
of
my
wife
he
was
saying
but
she
is
more
than
a
wife
she
is
my
best
pal
and
i
may
add
she
is
also
my
severest
he
broke
off
here
for
an
obsequious
japanese
butler
entered
with
a
tray
of
cooling
drinks
the
tray
would
be
gleaming
silver
but
he
was
uncertain
about
the
drinks
something
with
long
straws
in
them
probably
but
as
to
anything
alcoholic
now
while
he
was
trying
to
determine
this
the
window
was
opened
and
the
interview
had
to
wait
but
anyway
you
could
smoke
where
you
wished
in
that
house
and
gashwiler
couldn
t
smoke
any
closer
to
his
house
than
the
front
porch
even
trying
it
there
he
would
be
nagged
and
fussily
asked
why
he
didn
t
go
out
to
the
barn
he
was
a
poor
fish
gashwiler
a
country
storekeeper
without
a
future
a
clod
merton
after
waiting
in
line
obtained
his
mail
consisting
of
three
magazines
photo
land
silver
screenings
and
camera
as
he
stepped
away
he
saw
that
miss
tessie
kearns
stood
three
places
back
in
the
line
he
waited
at
the
door
for
her
miss
kearns
was
the
one
soul
in
simsbury
who
understood
him
he
had
confided
to
her
all
his
vast
ambitions
she
had
sympathized
with
them
and
her
encouragement
had
done
not
a
little
to
stiffen
his
resolution
at
odd
times
when
the
haven
of
hollywood
seemed
all
too
distant
a
certain
community
of
ambitions
had
been
the
foundation
of
this
sympathy
between
the
two
for
tessie
kearns
meant
to
become
a
scenario
writer
of
eminence
and
like
merton
she
was
now
both
studying
and
practising
a
difficult
art
she
conducted
the
millinery
and
dressmaking
establishment
next
to
the
gashwiler
emporium
but
found
time
as
did
merton
for
the
worthwhile
things
outside
her
narrow
life
she
was
a
slight
spare
little
figure
sedate
and
mouselike
of
middle
age
and
to
the
village
of
a
quiet
sober
way
of
thought
but
known
only
to
merton
her
real
life
was
one
of
terrific
adventure
involving
crime
of
the
most
atrocious
sort
and
contact
not
only
with
the
great
and
good
but
with
loathsome
denizens
of
the
underworld
who
would
commit
any
deed
for
hire
some
of
her
scenarios
would
have
profoundly
shocked
the
good
people
of
simsbury
and
she
often
suffered
tremors
of
apprehension
at
the
thought
that
one
of
them
might
be
enacted
at
the
bijou
palace
right
there
on
fourth
street
with
her
name
brazenly
announced
as
author
suppose
it
were
passion
s
perils
she
would
surely
have
to
leave
town
after
that
she
would
be
too
ashamed
to
stay
still
she
would
be
proud
also
for
by
that
time
they
would
be
calling
her
to
hollywood
itself
of
course
nothing
so
distressing
or
so
grand
had
happened
yet
for
none
of
her
dramas
had
been
accepted
but
she
was
coming
on
it
might
happen
any
time
she
joined
merton
a
long
envelope
in
her
hand
and
a
brave
little
smile
on
her
pinched
face
which
one
is
it
he
asked
referring
to
the
envelope
it
s
passion
s
she
answered
with
a
jaunty
affectation
of
amusement
the
people
sent
it
back
the
slip
says
its
being
returned
does
not
imply
any
lack
of
i
should
think
it
wouldn
t
said
merton
warmly
he
knew
passion
s
perils
a
company
might
have
no
immediate
need
for
it
but
its
rejection
could
not
possibly
imply
a
lack
of
merit
because
the
merit
was
there
no
one
could
dispute
that
they
walked
on
to
the
bijou
palace
its
front
was
dark
for
only
twice
a
week
on
tuesdays
and
saturdays
could
simsbury
muster
a
picture
audience
but
they
could
read
the
bills
for
the
following
night
the
entrance
was
flanked
on
either
side
by
billboards
and
they
stopped
before
the
first
merton
gill
s
heart
quickened
its
beats
for
there
was
billed
none
other
than
beulah
baxter
in
the
ninth
installment
of
her
tremendous
serial
the
hazards
of
hortense
it
was
going
to
be
good
it
almost
seemed
that
this
time
the
scoundrels
would
surely
get
hortense
she
was
speeding
across
a
vast
open
quarry
in
a
bucket
attached
to
a
cable
and
one
of
the
scoundrels
with
an
ax
was
viciously
hacking
at
the
cable
s
farther
anchorage
it
would
be
a
miracle
if
he
did
not
succeed
in
his
hellish
design
to
dash
hortense
to
the
cruel
rocks
below
merton
of
course
had
not
a
moment
s
doubt
that
the
miracle
would
intervene
he
had
seen
other
serials
so
he
made
no
comment
upon
the
gravity
of
the
situation
but
went
at
once
to
the
heart
of
his
ecstasy
the
most
beautiful
woman
on
the
screen
he
murmured
well
i
don
t
miss
kearns
appeared
about
to
advance
the
claims
of
rival
beauties
but
desisted
when
she
saw
that
merton
was
firm
none
of
the
rest
can
touch
her
he
maintained
and
look
at
her
nerve
would
your
others
have
as
much
nerve
as
that
maybe
she
has
someone
to
double
in
those
places
suggested
the
tessie
kearns
not
beulah
baxter
didn
t
i
see
her
personal
appearance
that
time
i
went
to
peoria
last
spring
on
purpose
to
see
it
didn
t
she
talk
about
the
risks
she
look
and
how
the
directors
were
always
begging
her
to
use
a
double
and
how
her
artistic
convictions
wouldn
t
let
her
do
any
such
thing
you
can
bet
the
little
girl
is
right
there
in
every
scene
they
passed
to
the
other
billboard
this
would
be
the
comedy
a
painfully
man
in
misfitting
clothes
was
doing
something
supposed
to
be
funny
pushing
a
lawn
mower
over
the
carpet
of
a
palatial
home
how
disgusting
exclaimed
miss
kearns
ain
t
it
said
merton
how
they
can
have
one
of
those
terrible
things
on
the
same
bill
with
miss
baxter
i
can
t
understand
those
censors
ought
to
suppress
this
sort
of
buffoonery
instead
of
scenes
of
dignified
passion
like
they
did
in
scarlet
sin
declared
tessie
did
you
read
about
that
they
sure
ought
agreed
merton
these
comedies
make
me
tired
i
never
see
one
if
i
can
help
walking
on
they
discussed
the
wretched
public
taste
and
the
wretched
actors
that
pandered
to
it
the
comedy
they
held
degraded
a
fine
and
beautiful
art
merton
was
especially
severe
he
always
felt
uncomfortable
at
one
of
these
regrettable
exhibitions
when
people
about
him
who
knew
no
better
laughed
heartily
he
had
never
seen
anything
to
laugh
at
and
said
as
much
they
crossed
the
street
and
paused
at
the
door
of
miss
kearns
shop
behind
which
were
her
living
rooms
she
would
go
over
passion
s
perils
once
more
and
send
it
to
another
company
i
wonder
she
said
to
merton
if
they
keep
sending
it
back
because
the
sets
are
too
expensive
of
course
there
s
the
one
where
the
dissipated
english
nobleman
count
blessingham
lures
valerie
into
westminster
abbey
for
his
own
evil
purposes
on
the
night
of
the
old
earl
s
murder
that
s
expensive
but
they
get
a
chance
to
use
it
again
when
valerie
is
led
to
the
altar
by
young
lord
stonecliff
the
rightful
heir
and
of
course
stonecliff
manor
where
valerie
is
first
seen
as
governess
would
be
expensive
but
they
use
that
in
a
lot
of
scenes
too
still
maybe
i
might
change
the
locations
around
to
something
they
ve
got
i
wouldn
t
change
a
line
said
merton
don
t
give
in
to
em
make
em
take
it
as
it
is
they
might
ruin
your
picture
with
cheap
well
the
authoress
debated
maybe
i
ll
leave
it
i
d
especially
hate
to
give
up
westminster
abbey
of
course
the
scene
where
she
is
struggling
with
count
blessingham
might
easily
be
made
offensive
it
s
a
strong
scene
but
it
all
comes
right
you
remember
she
wrenches
herself
loose
from
his
grasp
and
rushes
to
throw
herself
before
the
altar
which
suddenly
lights
up
and
the
scoundrel
is
afraid
to
pursue
her
there
because
he
had
a
thorough
religious
training
when
a
boy
at
oxford
and
he
feels
it
would
be
sacrilegious
to
seize
her
again
while
the
light
from
the
altar
shines
upon
her
that
way
and
so
she
s
saved
for
the
time
being
it
seems
kind
of
a
shame
not
to
use
westminster
abbey
for
a
really
big
scene
like
that
don
t
you
think
i
should
say
so
agreed
merton
warmly
they
build
plenty
of
sets
as
big
as
that
keep
it
in
well
i
ll
take
your
advice
and
i
shan
t
give
up
trying
with
my
other
ones
and
i
m
writing
to
another
set
of
people
see
she
took
from
her
handbag
a
clipped
advertisement
which
she
read
to
merton
in
the
fading
light
holding
it
close
to
her
keen
little
eyes
listen
five
thousand
photoplay
ideas
needed
working
girl
paid
ten
thousand
dollars
for
ideas
she
had
thought
worthless
yours
may
be
worth
more
experience
unnecessary
information
free
producers
league
piqua
doesn
t
that
sound
encouraging
and
it
isn
t
as
if
i
didn
t
have
some
experience
i
ve
been
writing
scenarios
for
two
years
we
both
got
to
be
patient
he
pointed
out
we
can
t
succeed
all
at
once
just
remember
oh
i
m
patient
and
i
m
determined
and
i
know
you
are
too
merton
but
the
way
my
things
keep
coming
back
well
i
guess
we
d
both
get
discouraged
if
it
wasn
t
for
our
sense
of
i
bet
we
would
agreed
merton
and
he
went
on
to
the
gashwiler
emporium
and
let
himself
into
the
dark
store
at
the
moment
he
was
bewailing
that
the
next
installment
of
the
hazards
of
hortense
would
be
shown
on
a
saturday
night
for
on
those
nights
the
store
kept
open
until
nine
and
he
could
see
it
but
once
on
a
tuesday
night
he
would
have
watched
it
twice
in
spite
of
the
comedy
unjustly
sharing
the
bill
with
it
lighting
a
match
he
made
his
way
through
the
silent
store
through
the
stock
room
that
had
so
lately
been
the
foul
lair
of
snake
le
vasquez
and
into
his
own
personal
domain
a
square
partitioned
off
from
the
stockroom
in
which
were
his
cot
the
table
at
which
he
studied
the
art
of
screen
acting
and
his
other
little
belongings
he
often
called
this
his
den
he
lighted
a
lamp
on
the
table
and
drew
the
chair
up
to
it
on
the
boards
of
the
partition
in
front
of
him
were
pasted
many
presentments
of
his
favourite
screen
actress
beulah
baxter
as
she
underwent
the
hazards
of
hortense
the
intrepid
girl
was
seen
leaping
from
the
seat
of
her
car
to
the
cab
of
a
passing
locomotive
her
chagrined
pursuers
in
the
distant
background
she
sprang
from
a
high
cliff
into
the
chill
waters
of
a
sea
bound
to
the
back
of
a
spirited
horse
she
was
raced
down
the
steep
slope
of
a
rocky
ravine
in
the
far
west
alone
in
a
foul
den
of
the
underworld
she
held
at
bay
a
dozen
villainous
asiatics
down
the
fire
escape
of
a
great
new
york
hotel
she
made
a
perilous
way
from
the
shrouds
of
a
tossing
ship
she
was
about
to
plunge
to
a
watery
release
from
the
persecutor
who
was
almost
upon
her
upon
the
roof
of
the
fifth
avenue
mansion
of
her
scoundrelly
guardian
in
the
great
city
of
new
york
she
was
gaining
the
friendly
projection
of
a
cornice
from
which
she
could
leap
and
again
escape
death
even
a
fate
worse
than
death
for
the
girl
was
pursued
from
all
sorts
of
base
motives
this
time
friendless
and
alone
in
profligate
new
york
she
would
leap
from
the
cornice
to
the
branches
of
the
great
eucalyptus
tree
that
grew
hard
by
unnerving
performances
like
these
were
a
constant
inspiration
to
merton
gill
he
knew
that
he
was
not
yet
fit
to
act
in
such
scenes
to
appear
opportunely
in
the
last
reel
of
each
installment
and
save
hortense
for
the
next
one
but
he
was
confident
a
day
would
come
on
the
same
wall
he
faced
also
a
series
of
photographs
of
himself
these
were
stills
to
be
one
day
shown
to
a
director
who
would
thereupon
perceive
his
screen
merits
there
was
merton
in
the
natty
belted
coat
with
his
hair
slicked
back
in
the
approved
mode
and
a
smile
upon
his
face
a
happy
careless
college
youth
there
was
merton
in
tennis
flannels
his
hair
nicely
disarranged
jauntily
holding
a
borrowed
racquet
here
he
was
in
a
trench
coat
and
the
cap
of
a
lieutenant
grim
of
face
the
jaw
set
holding
a
revolver
upon
someone
unpictured
there
in
a
sport
shirt
lolling
negligently
upon
a
bench
after
a
hard
game
of
polo
or
something
again
he
appeared
in
evening
dress
two
straightened
fingers
resting
against
his
left
temple
underneath
this
was
written
in
a
running
angular
distinguished
hand
very
truly
yours
clifford
this
and
prints
of
it
similarly
inscribed
would
one
day
go
to
unknown
admirers
who
besought
him
for
likenesses
of
himself
but
merton
lost
no
time
in
scanning
these
pictorial
triumphs
he
was
turning
the
pages
of
the
magazines
he
had
brought
his
first
hasty
search
being
for
new
photographs
of
his
heroine
he
was
quickly
rewarded
silver
screenings
proffered
some
fresh
views
of
beulah
baxter
not
in
dangerous
moments
but
revealing
certain
quieter
aspects
of
her
wondrous
life
in
her
kitchen
apron
clad
she
stirred
something
in
her
lofty
music
room
she
was
seated
at
her
piano
in
her
charming
library
she
was
shown
among
her
more
charmingly
she
was
portrayed
with
her
beautiful
arms
about
the
shoulders
of
her
dear
old
mother
and
these
accompanied
an
interview
with
the
actress
the
writer
one
esther
schwarz
professed
the
liveliest
trepidation
at
first
meeting
the
screen
idol
but
was
swiftly
reassured
by
the
unaffected
cordiality
of
her
reception
she
found
that
success
had
not
spoiled
miss
baxter
a
sincere
artist
she
yet
absolutely
lacked
the
usual
temperament
and
mannerisms
she
seemed
more
determined
than
ever
to
give
the
public
something
better
and
finer
her
splendid
dignity
reserve
humanness
high
ideals
and
patient
study
of
her
art
had
but
mellowed
not
hardened
a
gracious
personality
merton
gill
received
these
assurances
without
surprise
he
knew
beulah
baxter
would
prove
to
be
these
delightful
things
he
read
on
for
the
more
exciting
bits
i
m
so
interested
in
my
work
prettily
observed
miss
baxter
to
the
interviewer
suppose
we
talk
only
of
that
leave
out
all
the
rest
my
beverly
hills
home
my
cars
my
jewels
my
paris
gowns
my
dogs
my
servants
my
recreations
it
is
work
alone
that
counts
don
t
you
think
we
must
learn
that
success
all
that
is
beautiful
and
fine
requires
work
infinite
work
and
struggle
the
beautiful
comes
only
through
suffering
and
sacrifice
and
of
course
dramatic
work
broadens
a
girl
s
viewpoint
helps
her
to
get
the
real
the
worthwhile
things
out
of
life
enriching
her
nature
with
the
emotional
experience
of
her
roles
it
is
through
such
pressure
that
we
grow
and
we
must
grow
must
we
not
one
must
strive
for
the
ideal
for
the
art
which
will
be
but
the
pictorial
expression
of
that
and
for
the
emotion
which
must
be
touched
by
the
illuminating
vision
of
a
imagination
if
the
vital
message
of
the
film
is
to
be
felt
but
of
course
i
have
my
leisure
moments
from
the
grinding
stress
then
i
turn
to
my
books
i
m
wild
about
history
and
how
i
love
the
great
free
i
should
prefer
to
be
on
a
simple
farm
were
i
a
boy
the
public
would
not
have
me
a
boy
you
say
she
shrugged
prettily
oh
of
course
my
beauty
as
they
are
pleased
to
call
it
after
all
why
should
one
not
speak
of
that
beauty
is
just
a
stock
in
trade
you
know
why
not
acknowledge
it
frankly
but
do
come
to
my
delightful
kitchen
where
i
spend
many
a
spare
moment
and
see
the
lovely
custard
i
have
made
for
dear
mamma
s
merton
gill
was
entranced
by
this
exposition
of
the
quieter
side
of
his
idol
s
life
of
course
he
had
known
she
could
not
always
be
making
narrow
escapes
and
it
seemed
that
she
was
almost
more
delightful
in
this
staid
domestic
life
here
away
from
her
professional
perils
she
was
it
seemed
a
slim
little
girl
with
sad
eyes
and
a
wistful
the
picture
moved
him
strongly
more
than
ever
he
was
persuaded
that
his
day
would
come
even
might
come
the
day
when
it
would
be
his
lot
to
lighten
the
sorrow
of
those
eyes
and
appease
the
wistfulness
of
that
tender
mouth
he
was
less
sure
about
this
he
had
been
unable
to
learn
if
beulah
baxter
was
still
unwed
silver
screenings
in
reply
to
his
question
had
answered
camera
in
its
answers
to
correspondents
had
said
not
then
he
had
written
to
photo
land
is
beulah
baxter
unmarried
the
answer
had
come
he
had
been
able
to
make
little
of
these
replies
enigmatic
ambiguous
at
best
but
he
felt
that
some
day
he
would
at
least
be
chosen
to
act
with
this
slim
little
girl
with
the
sad
eyes
and
wistful
mouth
he
it
might
be
would
rescue
her
from
the
branches
of
the
great
eucalyptus
tree
growing
hard
by
the
fifth
avenue
mansion
of
the
scoundrelly
guardian
this
if
he
remembered
well
her
message
about
hard
work
he
recalled
now
the
wondrous
occasion
on
which
he
had
travelled
the
nearly
hundred
miles
to
peoria
to
see
his
idol
in
the
flesh
her
personal
appearance
had
been
advertised
it
was
on
a
saturday
night
but
merton
had
silenced
old
gashwiler
with
the
tale
of
a
dying
aunt
in
the
distant
city
even
so
the
old
grouch
had
been
none
too
considerate
he
had
seemed
to
believe
that
merton
s
aunt
should
have
died
nearer
to
simsbury
or
at
least
have
chosen
a
dull
monday
but
merton
had
held
with
dignity
to
the
point
a
dying
aunt
wasn
t
to
be
hustled
about
as
to
either
time
or
place
she
died
when
her
time
came
even
on
a
saturday
night
and
where
she
happened
to
be
though
it
were
a
hundred
miles
from
some
point
more
convenient
to
an
utter
stranger
he
had
gone
and
thrillingly
had
beheld
for
five
minutes
his
idol
in
the
flesh
the
slim
little
girl
of
the
sorrowful
eyes
and
wistful
mouth
as
she
told
the
vast
audience
it
seemed
to
merton
that
she
spoke
solely
to
him
by
what
narrow
chance
she
had
been
saved
from
disappointing
it
she
had
missed
the
train
but
had
at
once
leaped
into
her
roadster
and
made
the
journey
at
an
average
of
miles
an
hour
braving
death
a
dozen
times
for
her
public
was
dear
to
her
and
she
would
not
have
it
disappointed
and
there
she
was
before
them
in
her
trim
driving
suit
still
breathless
from
the
wild
ride
then
she
told
them
merton
especially
how
her
directors
had
again
and
again
besought
her
not
to
persist
in
risking
her
life
in
her
dangerous
exploits
but
to
allow
a
double
to
take
her
place
at
the
more
critical
moments
but
she
had
never
been
able
to
bring
herself
to
this
deception
for
deception
in
a
way
it
would
be
the
directors
had
entreated
in
vain
she
would
keep
faith
with
her
public
though
full
well
she
knew
that
at
any
time
one
of
her
acts
might
prove
fatal
her
public
was
very
dear
to
her
she
was
delighted
to
meet
it
here
face
to
face
heart
to
heart
she
clasped
her
own
slender
hands
over
her
own
heart
as
she
said
this
and
there
was
a
pathetic
little
catch
in
her
voice
as
she
waved
farewell
kisses
to
the
throng
many
a
heart
besides
merton
s
beat
more
quickly
at
knowing
that
she
must
rush
out
to
the
roadster
and
be
off
at
eighty
miles
an
hour
to
louis
where
another
vast
audience
would
the
next
day
be
breathlessly
awaiting
her
personal
appearance
merton
had
felt
abundantly
repaid
for
his
journey
there
had
been
inspiration
in
this
contact
little
he
minded
the
acid
greeting
on
his
return
of
a
mere
gashwiler
spawning
in
his
low
mind
a
monstrous
suspicion
that
the
dying
aunt
had
never
lived
now
he
read
in
his
magazines
other
intimate
interviews
by
other
talented
young
women
who
had
braved
the
presence
of
other
screen
idols
of
both
sexes
the
interviewers
approached
them
with
trepidation
and
invariably
found
that
success
had
not
spoiled
them
fine
artists
though
they
were
applauded
and
richly
rewarded
yet
they
remained
simple
unaffected
and
cordial
to
these
daring
reporters
they
spoke
with
quiet
dignity
of
their
work
their
earnest
efforts
to
give
the
public
something
better
and
finer
they
wished
the
countless
readers
of
the
interviews
to
comprehend
that
their
triumphs
had
come
only
with
infinite
work
and
struggle
that
the
beautiful
comes
only
through
suffering
and
sacrifice
at
lighter
moments
they
spoke
gayly
of
their
palatial
homes
their
domestic
pets
their
wives
or
husbands
and
their
charming
children
they
all
loved
the
great
but
their
chief
solace
from
toil
was
in
this
unruffled
domesticity
where
they
could
forget
the
worries
of
an
exacting
profession
and
lead
a
simple
home
life
all
the
husbands
and
wives
were
more
than
that
they
were
good
pals
and
of
course
they
read
and
studied
a
great
deal
many
of
them
were
wild
about
books
he
was
especially
interested
in
the
interview
printed
by
camera
with
that
world
favourite
harold
parmalee
for
this
was
the
screen
artist
whom
merton
most
envied
and
whom
he
conceived
himself
most
to
resemble
in
feature
the
lady
interviewer
miss
augusta
blivens
had
gone
trembling
into
the
presence
of
harold
parmalee
to
be
instantly
put
at
her
ease
by
the
young
artist
s
simple
unaffected
manner
he
chatted
of
his
early
struggles
when
he
was
only
too
glad
to
accept
the
few
paltry
hundreds
of
dollars
a
week
that
were
offered
him
in
minor
parts
of
his
quick
rise
to
eminence
of
his
unceasing
effort
to
give
the
public
something
better
and
finer
of
his
love
for
the
great
and
of
his
daily
flight
to
the
little
nest
that
sheltered
his
pal
wife
and
the
kiddies
here
he
could
be
truly
himself
a
man
s
man
loving
the
simple
things
of
life
here
in
his
library
surrounded
by
his
books
or
in
the
music
room
playing
over
some
little
chopin
prelude
or
on
the
lawn
romping
with
the
giant
police
dog
he
could
forget
the
public
that
would
not
let
him
rest
nor
had
he
been
spoiled
in
the
least
said
the
interviewer
by
the
adulation
poured
out
upon
him
by
admiring
women
and
girls
in
volume
sufficient
to
turn
the
head
of
a
less
sane
young
man
there
are
many
beautiful
women
in
the
pursued
the
writer
and
i
dare
say
there
is
not
one
who
meets
harold
parmalee
who
does
not
love
him
in
one
way
or
another
he
has
mental
brilliancy
for
the
intellectuals
good
looks
for
the
a
strong
vital
appeal
a
magnetism
almost
overwhelming
to
the
susceptible
and
an
easy
and
supremely
appealing
courtesy
for
every
woman
he
merton
drew
a
long
breath
after
reading
these
earnest
words
would
an
interviewer
some
day
be
writing
as
much
about
him
he
studied
the
pictures
of
harold
parmalee
that
abundantly
spotted
the
article
the
full
face
the
profile
the
symmetrical
shoulders
the
jaunty
bearing
the
easy
masterful
smile
from
each
of
these
he
would
raise
his
eyes
to
his
own
pictured
face
on
the
wall
above
him
undoubtedly
he
was
not
unlike
harold
parmalee
he
noted
little
similarities
he
had
the
nose
perhaps
a
bit
more
jutting
than
harold
s
and
the
chin
even
more
prominent
possibly
a
director
would
have
told
him
that
his
harold
parmalee
beauty
was
just
a
trifle
overdone
that
his
face
went
just
a
bit
past
the
line
of
pleasing
resemblance
and
into
something
else
but
at
this
moment
the
aspirant
was
reassured
his
eyes
were
pale
under
pale
brows
yet
they
showed
well
in
the
prints
and
he
was
slightly
built
perhaps
even
thin
but
a
diet
rich
in
fats
would
remedy
that
and
even
if
he
were
quite
a
little
less
comely
than
parmalee
he
would
still
be
impressive
after
all
a
great
deal
depended
upon
the
acting
and
he
was
learning
to
act
months
ago
the
resolution
big
in
his
heart
he
had
answered
the
advertisement
in
silver
screenings
urging
him
to
learn
movie
acting
a
fascinating
profession
that
pays
big
would
you
like
to
know
it
demanded
if
you
are
adapted
to
this
work
if
so
send
ten
cents
for
our
or
key
to
aptitude
and
find
whether
you
are
suited
to
take
it
merton
had
earnestly
wished
to
know
this
and
had
sent
ten
cents
to
the
film
incorporation
bureau
station
n
stebbinsville
arkansas
the
or
key
to
aptitude
had
come
he
had
mailed
his
answers
to
the
questions
and
waited
an
anguished
ten
days
fearing
that
he
would
prove
to
lack
the
required
aptitude
for
this
great
art
but
at
last
the
cheering
news
had
come
he
had
every
aptitude
in
full
measure
and
all
that
remained
was
to
subscribe
to
the
correspondence
course
he
had
felt
weak
in
the
moment
of
his
relief
from
this
torturing
anxiety
suppose
they
had
told
him
that
he
wouldn
t
do
and
he
had
studied
the
lessons
with
unswerving
determination
night
and
day
he
had
held
to
his
ideal
he
knew
that
when
you
did
this
your
hour
was
bound
to
come
he
yawned
now
thinking
instead
of
the
anger
expressions
he
should
have
been
practising
of
the
sordid
things
he
must
do
he
must
be
up
at
five
sprinkle
the
floor
sweep
it
take
down
the
dust
curtains
from
the
shelves
of
dry
goods
clean
and
fill
the
lamps
then
station
outside
the
dummies
in
their
raiment
all
day
he
would
serve
customers
snatching
a
hasty
lunch
of
crackers
and
cheese
behind
the
grocery
counter
and
at
night
instead
of
twice
watching
the
hazards
of
hortense
he
must
still
unreasonably
serve
late
customers
until
the
second
unwinding
of
those
delectable
reels
he
suddenly
sickened
of
it
all
was
he
not
sufficiently
versed
in
the
art
he
had
chosen
to
practise
and
old
gashwiler
every
day
getting
harder
to
bear
his
resolve
stiffened
he
would
not
wait
much
longer
only
until
the
savings
hidden
out
under
the
grocery
counter
had
grown
a
bit
he
made
ready
for
bed
taking
after
he
had
undressed
some
exercises
that
would
make
his
shoulders
a
trifle
more
like
harold
parmalee
s
this
rite
concluded
he
knelt
by
his
narrow
cot
and
prayed
briefly
oh
god
make
me
a
good
movie
actor
make
me
one
of
the
best
for
jesus
sake
amen
chapter
iii
western
stuff
saturday
proved
all
that
his
black
forebodings
had
pictured
it
a
day
of
sordid
harassing
toil
toil
moreover
for
which
gashwiler
the
beneficiary
showed
but
the
scantest
appreciation
indeed
the
day
opened
with
a
disagreement
between
the
clerk
and
his
reactionary
gashwiler
had
reached
the
store
at
his
accustomed
hour
of
to
find
merton
embellishing
the
bulletin
board
in
front
with
legends
setting
forth
especial
bargains
of
the
day
to
be
had
within
chalk
in
hand
he
had
neatly
written
see
our
new
importation
of
taffetas
the
below
this
he
was
in
the
act
of
putting
down
try
our
choice
spinach
cts
the
try
our
preferred
chipped
beef
cts
the
he
was
especially
liking
that
use
of
it
sounded
modern
yet
along
came
gashwiler
as
if
seeking
an
early
excuse
to
nag
and
criticized
this
why
don
t
you
say
a
yard
a
can
a
pound
he
demanded
harshly
what
s
the
sense
of
that
there
the
stuff
looks
to
me
like
just
putting
on
a
few
airs
you
keep
to
plain
language
and
our
patrons
ll
like
it
a
lot
viciously
merton
gill
rubbed
out
the
modern
the
and
substituted
the
desired
very
well
he
assented
if
you
d
rather
stick
to
the
way
but
i
can
tell
you
that
s
the
way
city
stores
do
it
i
thought
you
might
want
to
be
up
to
date
but
i
see
i
made
a
great
humph
said
gashwiler
unbitten
by
this
irony
i
guess
the
old
way
s
good
enough
long
s
our
prices
are
always
right
don
t
forget
to
put
on
that
canned
salmon
i
had
that
in
stock
for
nearly
a
year
now
and
say
it
s
twenty
cents
a
can
not
the
can
also
say
it
s
a
grand
reduction
from
that
was
always
the
way
you
never
could
please
the
old
grouch
and
so
began
the
labour
that
lasted
until
nine
that
night
merton
must
count
out
eggs
and
weigh
butter
that
was
brought
in
he
must
do
up
sugar
and
grind
coffee
and
measure
dress
goods
and
match
silks
he
must
with
the
suavest
gentility
ask
if
there
would
not
be
something
else
and
he
must
see
that
babies
hazardously
left
on
counters
did
not
roll
off
he
lived
in
a
vortex
of
mental
confusion
performing
his
tasks
mechanically
when
drawing
a
gallon
of
kerosene
or
refolding
the
shown
dress
goods
or
at
any
task
not
requiring
him
to
be
genially
talkative
he
would
be
saying
to
miss
augusta
blivens
in
hollywood
yes
my
wife
is
more
than
a
wife
she
is
my
best
pal
and
i
may
also
add
my
severest
there
was
but
one
break
in
the
dreary
monotony
and
that
was
when
lowell
hardy
simsbury
s
highly
artistic
photographer
came
in
to
leave
an
order
for
groceries
lowell
wore
a
soft
hat
with
rakish
brim
and
affected
low
collars
and
flowing
cravats
the
artistic
effect
of
these
being
heightened
in
his
studio
work
by
a
purple
velvet
jacket
even
in
gashwiler
s
he
stood
out
as
an
artist
merton
received
his
order
and
noting
that
gashwiler
was
beyond
earshot
bespoke
his
services
for
the
following
afternoon
say
lowell
be
on
the
lot
at
two
sharp
will
you
i
want
to
shoot
some
western
stuff
some
merton
thrilled
as
he
used
these
highly
technical
phrases
he
had
not
read
his
magazines
for
nothing
lowell
hardy
considered
then
consented
he
believed
that
he
too
might
some
day
be
called
to
hollywood
after
they
had
seen
the
sort
of
work
he
could
turn
out
he
always
finished
his
art
studies
of
merton
with
great
care
and
took
pains
to
have
the
artist
s
signature
entirely
legible
all
right
mert
i
ll
be
there
i
got
some
new
patent
paper
i
ll
try
out
on
on
the
lot
at
two
sharp
to
shoot
western
stuff
repeated
merton
with
relish
right
o
assented
lowell
and
returned
to
more
prosaic
studio
art
the
day
wore
itself
to
a
glad
end
the
last
exigent
customer
had
gone
the
curtains
were
up
the
lights
were
out
and
at
five
minutes
past
nine
the
released
slave
meeting
tessie
kearns
at
her
front
door
escorted
her
with
a
high
heart
to
the
second
show
at
the
bijou
palace
they
debated
staying
out
until
after
the
wretched
comedy
had
been
run
but
later
agreed
that
they
should
see
this
as
tessie
keenly
wished
to
know
why
people
laughed
at
such
things
the
antics
of
the
painfully
man
distressed
them
both
though
the
mental
inferiors
by
whom
they
were
surrounded
laughed
noisily
merton
wondered
how
any
producer
could
bring
himself
to
debase
so
great
an
art
and
tessie
wondered
if
she
hadn
t
in
a
way
been
aiming
over
the
public
s
head
with
her
scenarios
after
all
you
had
to
give
the
public
what
it
wanted
she
began
to
devise
comedy
elements
for
her
next
drama
but
the
hazards
of
hortense
came
mercifully
to
soothe
their
annoyance
the
slim
little
girl
with
a
wistful
smile
underwent
a
rich
variety
of
hazards
each
threatening
a
terrible
death
through
them
all
she
came
unscathed
leaving
behind
her
a
trail
of
infuriated
scoundrels
whom
she
had
thwarted
she
escaped
from
an
underworld
den
in
a
chicago
slum
just
in
the
nick
of
time
cleverly
concealing
herself
in
the
branches
of
the
great
eucalyptus
tree
that
grew
hard
by
while
her
maddened
pursuers
scattered
in
their
search
for
the
prize
again
she
was
captured
this
time
to
be
conveyed
by
aeroplane
a
helpless
prisoner
and
subject
to
the
most
fiendish
insults
by
black
steve
to
the
frozen
north
but
in
the
far
alaskan
wilds
she
eluded
the
fiends
and
drove
swiftly
over
the
frozen
wastes
with
their
only
dog
team
having
left
her
pursuers
far
behind
she
decided
to
rest
for
the
night
in
a
deserted
cabin
along
the
way
here
a
blizzard
drove
snow
through
the
chinks
between
the
logs
and
a
pack
of
fierce
wolves
besieged
her
she
tried
to
bar
the
door
but
the
bar
was
gone
at
that
moment
she
heard
a
call
could
it
be
black
steve
again
no
thank
heaven
the
door
was
pushed
open
and
there
stood
ralph
murdock
her
fiance
there
was
a
quick
embrace
and
words
of
cheer
from
ralph
they
must
go
on
but
no
the
wind
cut
like
a
knife
and
the
wolves
still
prowled
the
film
here
showed
a
running
insert
of
cruel
wolves
exposing
all
their
fangs
ralph
had
lost
his
rifle
he
went
now
to
put
his
arm
through
the
iron
loops
in
place
of
the
missing
bar
the
wolves
sought
to
push
open
the
door
but
ralph
s
arm
foiled
them
then
the
outside
of
the
cabin
was
shown
with
black
steve
and
his
three
ugly
companions
furtively
approaching
the
wolves
had
gone
but
human
wolves
ten
thousand
times
more
cruel
had
come
in
their
place
back
in
the
cabin
ralph
and
hortense
discovered
that
the
wolves
had
gone
it
had
an
ugly
look
why
should
the
wolves
go
ralph
opened
the
door
and
they
both
peered
out
there
in
the
shadow
of
a
eucalyptus
tree
stood
black
steve
and
his
dastardly
crew
they
were
about
to
storm
the
cabin
all
was
undoubtedly
lost
not
until
the
following
week
would
the
world
learn
how
hortense
and
her
manly
fiance
had
escaped
this
trap
again
had
beulah
baxter
striven
and
suffered
to
give
the
public
something
better
and
finer
a
wonder
girl
declared
merton
when
they
were
again
in
the
open
that
s
what
i
call
her
a
wonder
girl
and
she
owes
it
all
to
hard
unceasing
struggle
and
work
and
pains
and
being
careful
you
ought
to
read
that
new
interview
with
her
in
this
month
s
silver
yes
yes
she
s
wonderful
assented
tessie
as
they
strolled
to
the
door
of
her
shop
but
i
ve
been
thinking
about
comedy
you
know
my
new
one
i
m
writing
of
course
it
s
a
big
vital
theme
all
about
a
heartless
wife
with
her
mind
wholly
on
society
and
bridge
clubs
and
dancing
and
that
sort
of
dissipation
and
her
husband
is
hubert
glendenning
a
studious
young
lawyer
who
doesn
t
like
to
go
out
evenings
but
would
rather
play
with
the
kiddies
a
bit
after
their
mother
has
gone
to
a
party
or
read
over
some
legal
documents
in
the
library
which
is
very
beautifully
furnished
and
her
old
school
friend
corona
bartlett
comes
to
stay
at
the
house
a
very
voluptuous
type
high
coloured
with
black
hair
and
lots
of
turquoise
jewellery
and
she
s
a
bad
woman
through
and
through
and
been
divorced
and
everything
by
a
man
whose
heart
she
broke
and
she
s
become
a
mere
adventuress
with
a
secret
vice
she
takes
perfume
in
her
tea
like
i
saw
that
one
did
and
all
her
evil
instincts
are
aroused
at
once
by
hubert
who
doesn
t
really
care
deeply
for
her
as
she
has
only
a
surface
appeal
of
mere
sensuous
beauty
but
he
sees
that
his
wife
is
neglecting
him
and
having
an
affair
with
an
italian
count
i
found
such
a
good
name
for
him
count
ravioli
and
staying
out
with
him
until
all
hours
so
in
a
moment
of
weakness
he
gives
himself
to
corona
bartlett
and
then
sees
that
he
must
break
up
his
home
and
get
a
divorce
and
marry
corona
to
make
an
honest
woman
of
her
but
of
course
his
wife
is
brought
to
her
senses
so
she
sees
that
she
has
been
in
the
wrong
and
has
a
big
scene
with
corona
in
which
she
scorns
her
and
corona
slinks
away
and
she
forgives
hubert
his
one
false
step
because
it
was
her
fault
it
s
full
of
big
situations
but
what
i
m
wondering
i
m
wondering
if
i
couldn
t
risk
some
comedy
in
it
by
having
the
faithful
old
butler
a
man
nothing
so
outrageous
as
that
creature
we
just
saw
but
still
noticeably
do
you
think
it
would
lighten
some
of
the
grimmer
scenes
perhaps
and
wouldn
t
it
be
good
pathos
to
have
the
butler
aware
of
his
infirmity
and
knowing
the
greatest
surgeons
in
the
world
can
t
help
him
well
merton
considered
if
i
were
you
i
shouldn
t
chance
it
it
would
be
mere
acrobatic
humour
and
why
do
you
want
any
one
to
be
funny
when
you
have
a
big
gripping
thing
of
love
and
hate
like
that
i
don
t
believe
i
d
have
him
i
d
have
him
elderly
and
simple
and
dignified
and
you
don
t
want
your
audience
to
laugh
do
you
when
he
holds
up
both
hands
to
show
how
shocked
he
is
at
the
way
things
are
going
on
in
that
house
well
maybe
i
won
t
then
it
was
just
a
thought
i
believe
you
have
the
right
instinct
in
those
matters
merton
i
ll
leave
him
as
he
then
said
merton
i
got
to
be
on
the
lot
my
camera
man
s
coming
at
two
shooting
some
western
oh
my
really
tessie
gazed
after
him
admiringly
he
let
himself
into
the
dark
store
so
lately
the
scene
of
his
torment
and
on
the
way
to
his
little
room
stopped
to
reach
under
the
grocery
counter
for
those
hidden
savings
he
would
add
to
them
the
fifteen
dollars
lavished
upon
him
by
gashwiler
at
the
close
of
a
week
s
toil
the
money
was
in
a
tobacco
pouch
he
lighted
the
lamp
on
his
table
placed
the
three
new
bills
beside
it
and
drew
out
the
hoard
he
would
count
it
to
confirm
his
memory
of
the
grand
total
the
bills
were
frayed
lacking
the
fresh
green
of
new
ones
weary
looking
with
an
air
of
being
glad
to
rest
at
last
after
much
passing
from
hand
to
hand
as
symbols
of
wealth
their
exalted
present
owner
tenderly
smoothed
out
several
secured
them
in
a
neat
pile
adding
the
three
recently
acquired
bills
and
proceeded
to
count
moistening
the
ends
of
a
thumb
and
finger
in
defiance
of
the
best
sanitary
teaching
it
was
no
time
to
think
of
malignant
bacteria
by
his
remembered
count
he
should
now
be
possessed
of
two
hundred
and
twelve
dollars
and
there
was
the
bill
a
limp
gray
thing
abraded
almost
beyond
identification
he
placed
this
down
first
knowing
that
the
remaining
bills
should
amount
to
two
hundred
and
ten
dollars
slowly
he
counted
to
finish
with
a
look
of
blank
hesitating
wonder
he
made
another
count
hastily
but
taking
greater
care
the
wonder
grew
again
he
counted
slowly
this
time
so
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
and
now
he
knew
he
possessed
dollars
more
than
he
had
thought
knowing
this
was
right
he
counted
again
for
the
luxury
of
it
two
hundred
and
obvious
dollars
how
had
he
lost
count
he
tried
to
recall
he
could
remember
taking
out
the
money
he
had
paid
lowell
hardy
for
the
last
batch
of
clifford
armytage
stills
for
lowell
although
making
professional
rates
to
merton
still
believed
the
artist
to
be
worth
his
hire
and
he
could
remember
taking
some
more
out
to
send
to
the
house
in
chicago
for
the
cowboy
things
but
it
was
plain
that
he
had
twice
at
least
crowded
a
week
s
salary
into
the
pouch
and
forgotten
it
it
was
a
pleasurable
experience
it
was
like
finding
dollars
and
he
was
by
that
much
nearer
to
his
goal
that
much
sooner
would
he
be
released
from
bondage
dollars
sooner
could
he
look
gashwiler
in
the
eye
and
say
what
he
thought
of
him
and
his
emporium
in
his
nightly
prayer
he
did
not
neglect
to
render
thanks
for
this
he
dressed
the
next
morning
with
a
new
elation
he
must
be
more
careful
about
keeping
tab
on
his
money
but
also
it
was
wonderful
to
find
more
than
you
expected
he
left
the
storeroom
that
reeked
of
kerosene
and
passed
into
the
emporium
to
replace
his
treasure
in
its
hiding
place
the
big
room
was
dusky
behind
the
drawn
front
curtains
but
all
the
smells
were
there
the
smell
of
ground
coffee
and
spices
at
the
grocery
counter
farther
on
the
smothering
smell
of
prints
and
woolens
and
new
leather
the
dummies
waiting
down
by
the
door
to
be
put
outside
regarded
each
other
in
blank
solemnity
a
few
big
flies
droned
lazily
about
their
still
forms
merton
eyed
the
dusty
floor
the
gleaming
counters
the
curtains
that
shielded
the
shelves
with
a
new
disdain
sooner
than
he
had
thought
he
would
bid
them
a
last
farewell
and
at
least
he
was
free
of
them
free
to
be
on
the
lot
at
two
to
shoot
western
stuff
let
with
its
old
round
of
degrading
tasks
take
care
of
itself
at
he
was
in
church
he
was
not
as
attentive
to
the
sermon
as
he
should
have
been
for
it
now
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
no
stills
of
himself
in
the
garb
of
a
clergyman
this
was
worth
considering
because
he
was
not
going
to
be
one
of
those
actors
he
would
have
a
wide
range
of
roles
he
would
be
able
to
play
anything
he
wondered
how
the
rev
otto
carmichael
would
take
the
request
for
a
brief
loan
of
one
of
his
pulpit
suits
perhaps
he
was
not
so
old
as
he
looked
perhaps
he
might
remember
that
he
too
had
once
been
young
and
fired
with
high
ideals
it
would
be
worth
trying
and
the
things
could
be
returned
after
a
brief
studio
session
with
lowell
hardy
he
saw
himself
cast
in
such
a
part
the
handsome
young
clergyman
exponent
of
a
muscular
christianity
he
comes
to
the
toughest
cattle
town
in
all
the
great
southwest
determined
to
make
honest
men
and
good
women
of
its
sinning
derelicts
he
wins
the
hearts
of
these
rugged
but
misguided
souls
though
at
first
they
treat
him
rough
they
learn
to
respect
him
and
they
call
him
the
fighting
parson
eventually
he
wins
the
hand
in
marriage
of
the
youngest
of
the
denizens
a
sweet
young
girl
who
despite
her
evil
surroundings
has
remained
as
pure
and
good
as
she
is
beautiful
anyway
if
he
had
those
clothes
for
an
hour
or
two
while
the
artist
made
a
few
studies
of
him
he
would
have
something
else
to
show
directors
in
search
of
fresh
talent
after
church
he
ate
a
lonely
meal
served
by
metta
judson
at
the
gashwiler
residence
the
gashwilers
were
on
their
accustomed
sabbath
visit
to
the
distant
farm
of
gashwiler
s
father
but
as
he
ate
he
became
conscious
that
the
gashwiler
influence
was
not
wholly
withdrawn
from
above
the
mantel
he
was
sternly
regarded
by
a
tinted
enlargement
of
his
employer
s
face
entitled
photographic
study
by
lowell
hardy
lowell
never
took
photographs
merely
he
made
photographic
studies
and
the
specimen
at
hand
was
one
of
his
most
daring
efforts
merton
glared
at
it
in
free
hostility
a
clod
with
ideals
as
false
as
the
artist
s
pink
on
his
leathery
cheeks
he
hurried
his
meal
glad
to
be
relieved
from
the
inimical
scrutiny
he
was
glad
to
be
free
from
this
and
from
the
determined
recital
by
metta
judson
of
happenings
what
cared
he
that
gus
giddings
had
been
fined
ten
dollars
and
costs
by
squire
belcher
for
his
low
escapade
or
that
gus
s
father
had
sworn
to
lick
him
within
an
inch
of
his
life
if
he
ever
ketched
him
touching
stimmilints
again
he
went
to
the
barn
climbed
to
the
hayloft
and
undid
the
bundle
containing
his
buck
benson
outfit
this
was
fresh
from
the
house
in
chicago
he
took
out
almost
reverently
a
pair
of
boots
with
purple
tops
a
pair
of
spurs
a
gay
shirt
a
gayer
neckerchief
a
hat
a
leather
holster
and
most
impressive
of
all
a
pair
of
goatskin
chaps
dyed
a
violent
maroon
all
these
he
excitedly
donned
the
spurs
last
then
he
clambered
down
the
ladder
from
the
loft
somewhat
impeded
by
the
spurs
and
went
into
the
kitchen
metta
judson
washing
dishes
gave
a
little
cry
of
alarm
nothing
like
this
had
ever
before
invaded
the
gashwiler
home
by
front
door
or
back
why
mert
gill
whatever
you
dressed
up
like
that
for
my
stars
you
look
like
a
cowboy
or
something
well
i
must
say
say
metta
do
me
a
favour
i
want
to
see
how
these
things
look
in
a
glass
it
s
a
cowboy
outfit
for
when
i
play
regular
buck
benson
parts
and
everything
s
got
to
be
just
so
or
the
audience
writes
to
the
magazines
about
it
and
makes
fun
of
go
ahead
said
metta
you
can
git
a
fine
look
at
yourself
in
the
tall
glass
in
the
old
lady
s
forthwith
he
went
profaning
a
sanctuary
to
survey
himself
in
a
glass
that
had
never
reflected
anything
but
the
discreet
arraying
of
his
employer
s
lady
he
looked
long
and
earnestly
the
effect
was
quite
all
he
had
hoped
he
lowered
the
front
of
the
hat
the
least
bit
tightened
his
belt
another
notch
and
moved
the
holster
to
a
better
line
he
looked
again
from
feet
to
head
he
was
perfect
then
slightly
crouching
he
drew
his
revolver
from
the
holster
and
held
it
forward
from
the
hip
wrist
and
forearm
rigidly
straight
throw
up
your
hands
he
uttered
the
grim
words
in
a
low
tone
but
one
facing
him
would
not
have
been
deceived
by
low
tones
grim
of
face
relentless
in
all
his
bearing
the
most
desperate
adversary
would
have
quailed
probably
even
gashwiler
himself
would
have
quailed
when
buck
benson
looked
and
spoke
thus
he
meant
it
he
held
it
a
long
breathless
moment
before
relaxing
then
he
tiptoed
softly
from
the
hallowed
confines
of
a
good
woman
s
boudoir
and
clattered
down
the
back
stairs
to
the
kitchen
he
was
thinking
i
certainly
got
to
get
me
another
gun
if
i
m
ever
going
to
do
benson
parts
and
i
got
to
get
the
draw
down
better
i
ain
t
quick
enough
well
did
you
like
your
rig
inquired
metta
genially
oh
it
ll
do
for
the
stills
we
re
shooting
replied
the
actor
of
course
i
ought
to
have
a
band
on
my
hat
and
the
things
look
too
new
yet
and
say
metta
where
s
the
clothesline
i
want
to
practise
roping
a
little
before
my
camera
man
gets
my
stars
you
re
certainly
goin
to
be
a
real
one
ain
t
you
she
brought
him
the
clothesline
in
use
only
on
mondays
he
it
carefully
and
made
a
running
noose
in
one
end
at
two
lowell
hardy
found
his
subject
casting
the
rope
at
an
inattentive
dexter
the
old
horse
stood
in
the
yard
head
down
one
foot
crossed
nonchalantly
before
the
other
a
slight
tremor
a
nervous
flickering
of
his
skin
was
all
that
ensued
when
the
rope
grazed
him
when
it
merely
fell
in
his
general
neighbourhood
as
it
oftener
did
dexter
did
not
even
glance
up
good
stuff
applauded
the
artist
now
just
stand
that
way
holding
the
noose
out
i
want
to
make
a
study
of
he
rapidly
mounted
his
camera
on
a
tripod
and
put
in
a
plate
the
study
was
made
followed
several
studies
of
the
fighting
face
of
benson
grim
and
rigid
about
to
shoot
from
the
hip
but
these
were
minor
bits
more
important
would
be
buck
benson
and
his
old
pal
pinto
from
the
barn
merton
dragged
the
saddle
blanket
and
bridle
he
had
borrowed
from
the
giddings
house
livery
stable
he
had
never
saddled
a
horse
before
but
he
had
not
studied
in
vain
he
seized
dexter
by
a
wisp
of
his
surviving
mane
and
simultaneously
planted
a
hearty
kick
in
the
beast
s
side
with
a
command
get
around
there
you
old
skate
dexter
sighed
miserably
and
got
around
as
ordered
he
was
both
pained
and
astonished
he
knew
that
this
was
sunday
never
had
he
been
forced
to
work
on
this
day
but
he
meekly
suffered
the
protrusion
of
a
bit
between
his
yellow
teeth
and
shuddered
but
slightly
when
a
blanket
and
then
a
heavy
saddle
were
flung
across
his
back
true
he
looked
up
in
some
dismay
when
the
girth
was
tightened
not
once
in
all
his
years
had
he
been
saddled
he
was
used
to
having
things
loose
around
his
waist
the
girth
went
still
tighter
dexter
glanced
about
with
genuine
concern
someone
was
intending
to
harm
him
he
curved
his
swanlike
neck
and
snapped
savagely
at
the
shoulder
of
his
aggressor
who
kicked
him
again
in
the
side
and
yelled
whoa
there
dang
you
dexter
subsided
he
saw
it
was
no
use
whatever
queer
thing
they
meant
to
do
to
him
would
be
done
despite
all
his
resistance
still
his
alarm
had
caused
him
to
hold
up
his
head
now
he
was
looking
much
more
like
a
horse
there
said
merton
gill
and
as
a
finishing
touch
he
lashed
the
coiled
clothesline
to
the
front
of
the
saddle
now
here
get
me
this
way
this
is
one
of
the
best
things
i
do
that
is
so
fondly
he
twined
his
arms
about
the
long
thin
neck
of
dexter
who
tossed
his
head
and
knocked
off
the
cowboy
hat
never
mind
that
it
s
out
said
merton
can
t
use
it
in
this
he
laid
his
cheek
to
the
cheek
of
his
pet
well
old
pal
they
re
takin
yuh
from
me
but
we
got
to
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
you
an
me
has
been
through
some
purty
lively
times
together
but
we
got
to
face
the
music
at
last
there
lowell
did
you
get
that
the
artist
had
made
his
study
he
made
three
others
of
the
same
affecting
scene
at
different
angles
dexter
was
overwhelmed
with
endearments
doubtless
he
was
puzzled
to
be
kicked
in
the
ribs
at
one
moment
the
next
to
be
fondled
but
lowell
hardy
was
enthusiastic
he
said
he
would
have
some
corking
studies
he
made
another
of
buck
benson
preparing
to
mount
good
old
pinto
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
buck
it
appeared
was
not
even
half
prepared
to
mount
go
on
jump
on
him
now
suggested
the
artist
i
ll
get
a
few
more
that
well
i
don
t
know
merton
hesitated
he
was
years
old
and
he
had
never
yet
been
aboard
a
horse
perhaps
he
shouldn
t
try
to
go
too
far
in
one
lesson
you
see
the
old
boy
s
pretty
tired
from
his
week
s
work
maybe
i
better
not
mount
him
say
i
ll
tell
you
take
me
rolling
a
cigarette
just
standing
by
him
i
darned
near
forgot
the
from
the
barn
he
brought
a
sack
of
tobacco
and
some
brown
papers
he
had
no
intention
of
smoking
but
this
kind
of
cigarette
was
too
completely
identified
with
buck
benson
to
be
left
out
lolling
against
the
side
of
dexter
he
poured
tobacco
from
the
sack
into
one
of
the
papers
get
me
this
way
he
directed
just
pouring
it
he
had
not
yet
learned
to
roll
a
cigarette
but
gus
giddings
the
simsbury
outlaw
had
promised
to
teach
him
anyway
it
was
enough
now
to
be
looking
keenly
out
from
under
his
hat
while
he
poured
tobacco
into
the
creased
paper
against
the
background
of
good
old
pinto
an
art
study
of
this
pose
was
completed
but
lowell
hardy
craved
more
action
more
variety
go
on
get
up
on
him
he
urged
i
want
to
make
a
study
of
well
again
merton
faltered
the
old
skate
s
tired
out
from
a
hard
week
and
i
m
not
feeling
any
too
lively
shucks
it
won
t
kill
him
if
you
get
on
his
back
for
a
minute
will
it
and
you
ll
want
one
on
him
to
show
won
t
you
hurry
up
while
the
light
s
yes
he
would
need
a
mounted
study
to
show
many
times
he
had
enacted
a
scene
in
which
a
director
had
looked
over
the
art
studies
of
clifford
armytage
and
handed
them
back
with
the
remark
but
you
seem
to
play
only
society
parts
armytage
all
very
interesting
and
i
ve
no
doubt
we
can
place
you
very
soon
but
just
at
present
we
re
needing
a
lead
for
a
western
a
man
who
can
look
the
part
and
thereupon
he
handed
these
buck
benson
stills
to
the
man
whose
face
would
instantly
relax
into
an
expression
of
pleased
surprise
the
very
thing
he
would
say
and
among
those
stills
certainly
should
be
one
of
clifford
armytage
actually
on
the
back
of
his
horse
he
d
chance
it
all
right
just
a
he
clutched
the
bridle
reins
of
dexter
under
his
drooping
chin
and
overcoming
a
feeble
resistance
dragged
him
alongside
the
watering
trough
dexter
at
first
thought
he
was
wished
to
drink
but
a
kick
took
that
nonsense
out
of
him
with
extreme
care
merton
stood
upon
the
edge
of
the
trough
and
thrust
a
leg
blindly
over
the
saddle
with
some
determined
clambering
he
was
at
last
seated
his
feet
were
in
the
stirrups
there
was
a
strange
light
in
his
eyes
there
was
a
strange
light
in
dexter
s
eyes
to
each
of
them
the
experience
was
not
only
without
precedent
but
rather
unpleasant
ride
him
out
in
the
middle
here
away
from
that
well
directed
the
camera
man
you
you
better
lead
him
out
suggested
the
rider
i
can
feel
him
tremble
already
he
he
might
break
down
under
metta
judson
from
the
back
porch
here
came
into
the
piece
with
lines
that
the
author
had
assuredly
not
written
for
her
giddap
there
you
dexter
gashwiler
called
metta
loudly
and
with
the
best
intentions
you
keep
still
commanded
the
rider
severely
not
turning
his
head
what
a
long
way
it
seemed
to
the
ground
he
had
never
dreamed
that
horses
were
so
lofty
better
lead
him
he
repeated
to
his
camera
man
lowell
hardy
grasped
the
bridle
reins
and
after
many
vain
efforts
persuaded
dexter
to
stumble
away
from
the
well
his
rider
grasped
the
horn
of
his
saddle
look
out
don
t
let
him
buck
he
called
but
dexter
had
again
become
motionless
except
for
a
recurrent
trembling
under
this
monstrous
infliction
now
there
began
the
artist
hold
that
you
re
looking
off
over
the
western
hills
atta
boy
wait
till
i
get
a
side
move
your
camera
said
the
rider
seems
to
me
he
doesn
t
want
to
turn
but
again
the
artist
turned
dexter
half
around
that
wasn
t
so
bad
merton
began
to
feel
the
thrill
of
it
he
even
lounged
in
the
saddle
presently
one
leg
over
the
pommel
and
seemed
about
to
roll
another
cigarette
while
another
art
study
was
made
he
continued
to
lounge
there
while
the
artist
packed
his
camera
what
had
he
been
afraid
of
he
could
sit
a
horse
as
well
as
the
next
man
probably
a
few
little
tricks
about
it
he
hadn
t
learned
yet
but
he
d
get
these
too
i
bet
they
ll
come
out
fine
he
called
to
the
departing
artist
leave
that
to
me
i
dare
say
i
ll
be
able
to
do
something
good
with
them
so
so
long
returned
merton
and
was
left
alone
on
the
back
of
a
horse
higher
than
people
would
think
until
they
got
on
him
indeed
he
was
beginning
to
like
it
if
you
just
had
a
little
nerve
you
needn
t
be
afraid
of
anything
very
carefully
he
clambered
from
the
saddle
his
old
pal
shook
himself
with
relief
and
stood
once
more
with
bowed
head
and
crossed
forelegs
his
late
burden
observed
him
approvingly
there
was
good
old
pinto
after
a
hard
day
s
run
over
the
mesa
he
had
borne
his
beloved
owner
far
ahead
of
the
sheriff
s
posse
and
was
now
securing
a
moment
s
rest
merton
undid
the
riata
and
for
half
an
hour
practised
casting
it
at
his
immobile
pet
once
the
noose
settled
unerringly
over
the
head
of
dexter
who
still
remained
immobile
then
there
was
the
lightning
draw
to
be
practised
again
and
again
the
trusty
weapon
of
buck
benson
flashed
from
its
holster
to
the
damage
of
a
slower
adversary
he
was
getting
that
draw
down
pretty
good
from
the
hip
with
straight
wrist
and
forearm
buck
was
ready
to
shoot
in
no
time
at
all
throughout
that
terrain
along
the
border
he
was
known
for
his
quick
draw
the
most
desperate
of
them
would
never
molest
him
except
they
could
shoot
him
from
behind
with
his
back
to
a
wall
they
slunk
from
the
encounter
elated
from
this
practice
and
from
the
memory
of
that
one
successful
rope
cast
merton
became
daring
in
the
extreme
he
considered
nothing
less
than
remounting
his
old
pal
and
riding
in
the
cool
of
early
evening
up
and
down
the
alley
upon
which
the
barnyard
gave
he
coiled
the
rope
and
again
lashed
it
to
the
left
front
of
the
saddle
then
he
curved
an
affectionate
arm
over
the
arched
neck
of
pinto
who
sighed
deeply
well
old
pal
you
and
me
has
still
got
some
mighty
long
miles
to
git
over
between
now
and
sunup
i
reckon
we
got
to
put
a
right
smart
of
distance
between
us
and
that
pesky
sheriff
s
posse
but
i
know
yuh
ain
t
lost
heart
old
dexter
here
tossed
his
head
being
cloyed
with
these
embraces
and
benson
caught
a
look
in
the
desperate
eyes
of
his
pet
which
he
did
not
wholly
like
perhaps
it
would
be
better
not
to
ride
him
any
more
perhaps
it
would
be
better
not
to
ride
him
again
until
next
sunday
after
all
wasn
t
dexter
practically
a
wild
horse
caught
up
from
the
range
and
broken
to
saddle
only
that
afternoon
no
use
overdoing
it
at
this
moment
the
beast
s
back
looked
higher
than
ever
it
was
the
cutting
remark
of
a
thoughtless
girl
that
confirmed
merton
in
his
rash
resolve
metta
judson
again
on
the
back
steps
surveyed
the
scene
with
kindling
eyes
i
bet
you
daresn
t
get
on
him
again
said
metta
these
were
strong
words
not
words
to
be
flung
lightly
at
benson
you
know
a
lot
about
it
don
t
you
parried
merton
gill
afraid
of
that
old
skate
murmured
metta
counterfeiting
the
inflections
of
pity
her
target
shot
her
a
glance
of
equal
pity
for
her
lack
of
understanding
and
banter
he
stalked
to
the
barnyard
gate
and
opened
it
the
way
to
his
haven
over
the
border
was
no
longer
barred
he
returned
to
dexter
firmly
grasped
the
bridle
reins
under
his
weak
chin
and
cajoled
him
again
to
the
watering
trough
metta
judson
was
about
to
be
overwhelmed
with
confusion
from
the
edge
of
the
trough
he
again
clambered
into
the
saddle
the
new
boots
groping
a
way
to
the
stirrups
the
reins
in
his
left
hand
he
swept
off
his
ideal
hat
with
a
careless
gesture
he
wished
he
had
had
an
art
study
made
of
this
but
you
can
t
think
of
everything
at
one
time
he
turned
loftily
to
metta
as
one
who
had
not
even
heard
her
tasteless
taunts
well
so
long
i
won
t
be
out
metta
was
now
convinced
that
she
had
in
her
heart
done
this
hero
a
wrong
you
better
be
here
before
the
folks
get
back
she
warned
merton
knew
this
as
well
as
she
did
but
the
folks
wouldn
t
be
back
for
a
couple
of
hours
yet
and
all
he
meant
to
venture
was
a
ride
at
sober
pace
the
length
of
the
alley
oh
i
ll
take
care
of
that
he
said
a
few
miles
stiff
gallop
ll
be
all
i
he
jerked
dexter
s
head
up
snapped
the
reins
on
his
neck
and
addressed
him
in
genial
comradely
but
authoritative
tones
git
up
there
old
hoss
dexter
lowered
his
head
again
and
remained
as
if
posing
conscientiously
for
the
statue
of
a
tired
horse
giddap
there
you
old
skate
again
ordered
the
rider
the
comradely
unction
was
gone
from
his
voice
and
the
bony
neck
received
a
smarter
wallop
with
the
reins
dexter
stood
unmoved
he
seemed
to
be
fearing
that
the
worst
was
now
coming
and
that
he
might
as
well
face
it
on
that
spot
as
elsewhere
he
remained
deaf
to
threats
and
entreaties
alike
no
hoof
moved
from
its
resting
place
giddap
there
you
old
dexter
gashwiler
ordered
metta
and
was
not
rebuked
but
neither
would
dexter
yield
to
a
woman
s
whim
i
ll
tell
you
said
merton
now
contemptuous
of
his
mount
get
the
buggy
whip
and
tickle
his
metta
sped
on
his
errand
her
eyes
shining
with
the
lust
for
torture
with
the
frayed
end
of
the
whip
from
the
delivery
wagon
she
lightly
scored
the
exposed
ribs
of
dexter
tormenting
him
with
devilish
cunning
dexter
s
hide
shuttled
back
and
forth
he
whinnied
protestingly
but
did
not
stir
even
one
hoof
that
s
the
idea
said
merton
feeling
scornfully
secure
on
the
back
of
this
spiritless
animal
keep
it
up
i
can
feel
him
coming
to
metta
kept
it
up
her
woman
s
ingenuity
contrived
new
little
tricks
with
the
instrument
of
torture
she
would
doubtless
have
had
a
responsible
post
with
the
spanish
inquisition
face
set
absorbed
in
her
evil
work
she
tickled
the
ribs
crosswise
and
tickled
between
them
up
and
down
always
with
the
artist
s
light
touch
dexter
s
frame
grew
tense
his
head
came
up
once
more
he
looked
like
a
horse
he
had
been
brave
to
face
destruction
but
he
found
himself
unable
to
face
being
tickled
to
death
if
only
they
had
chosen
some
other
method
for
his
execution
he
would
have
perished
gamely
but
this
was
exquisitely
poignant
beyond
endurance
he
tossed
his
head
and
stepped
into
a
trot
toward
the
open
gate
metta
yelled
in
triumph
the
rider
tossed
his
own
head
in
rhythm
to
dexter
s
trot
his
whole
body
tossed
in
the
saddle
it
was
a
fearsome
pace
the
sensations
were
like
nothing
he
had
ever
dreamed
of
and
he
was
so
high
above
the
good
firm
ground
dexter
continued
his
jolting
progress
to
the
applause
of
metta
the
rider
tried
to
command
metta
to
keep
still
and
merely
bit
his
tongue
stirred
to
life
by
the
tickling
dexter
now
became
more
acutely
aware
of
that
strange
restless
burden
on
his
back
and
was
inspired
to
free
himself
from
it
he
increased
his
pace
as
he
came
to
the
gate
and
managed
a
backward
kick
with
both
heels
this
lost
the
rider
his
stirrups
and
left
him
less
securely
seated
than
he
wished
to
be
he
dropped
the
reins
and
grasped
the
saddle
s
pommel
with
both
hands
he
strangely
seemed
to
consider
the
pommel
the
steering
wheel
of
a
motor
car
he
seemed
to
be
twisting
it
with
the
notion
of
guiding
dexter
all
might
have
been
well
but
on
losing
his
stirrups
the
rider
had
firmly
clasped
his
legs
about
the
waist
of
the
animal
again
and
again
he
tightened
them
and
now
dexter
not
only
looked
every
inch
a
horse
but
very
painfully
to
his
rider
felt
like
one
for
the
spurs
were
goring
him
to
a
most
seditious
behavior
the
mere
pace
was
slackened
only
that
he
might
alarmingly
kick
and
shake
himself
in
a
manner
as
terrifying
to
the
rider
as
it
was
unseemly
in
one
of
dexter
s
years
but
the
thing
was
inevitable
because
once
in
his
remote
hot
youth
dexter
cavorting
innocently
in
an
orchard
had
kicked
over
a
hive
of
busy
bees
which
had
been
attending
strictly
to
their
own
affairs
until
that
moment
after
that
they
had
attended
to
dexter
with
a
thoroughness
that
had
seared
itself
to
this
day
across
his
memory
he
now
sincerely
believed
that
he
had
overturned
another
hive
of
bees
and
that
not
but
by
the
most
strenuous
exertion
could
he
escape
from
their
harrying
they
were
stinging
him
venomously
along
his
sides
biting
deeper
with
every
jump
at
last
he
would
bear
his
rider
safely
over
the
border
the
rider
clasped
his
mount
ever
more
tightly
the
deep
dust
of
the
alley
road
mounted
high
over
the
spirited
scene
and
through
it
came
not
only
the
hearty
delight
of
metta
judson
in
peals
of
womanly
laughter
but
the
shrill
cries
of
the
three
ransom
children
whom
merton
had
not
before
noticed
these
were
calvin
ransom
aged
eight
elsie
ransom
aged
six
and
little
woodrow
ransom
aged
four
their
mother
had
lain
down
with
a
headache
having
first
ordered
them
to
take
their
picture
books
and
sit
quietly
in
the
parlour
as
good
children
should
on
a
sabbath
afternoon
so
they
had
noisily
pretended
to
obtain
the
picture
books
and
then
quietly
tiptoed
out
into
the
backyard
which
was
not
so
stuffy
as
the
parlour
detecting
the
meritorious
doings
in
the
gashwiler
barnyard
they
perched
in
a
row
on
the
alley
fence
and
had
been
excited
spectators
from
the
moment
that
merton
had
mounted
his
horse
in
shrill
but
friendly
voices
they
had
piped
oh
merton
gill
s
a
cowboy
merton
gill
s
a
cowboy
oh
looka
the
cowboy
on
the
big
horse
for
of
course
they
were
experts
and
would
know
a
cowboy
when
they
saw
one
they
followed
the
perilous
antics
of
dexter
as
he
issued
from
the
alley
gate
and
they
screamed
with
childish
delight
when
the
spurs
had
recalled
to
his
memory
that
dreadful
day
with
the
busy
bees
they
now
balanced
precariously
on
the
alley
fence
the
better
to
trace
merton
s
flight
through
the
dust
cloud
merton
s
in
a
runaway
merton
s
in
a
runaway
merton
s
in
a
runaway
they
shrieked
but
with
none
of
the
sympathy
that
would
have
become
them
they
appeared
to
rejoice
in
merton
s
plight
merton
s
in
a
runaway
they
joyously
chanted
suddenly
they
ceased
frozen
with
a
new
and
splendid
wonder
for
their
descriptive
phrase
was
now
inexact
merton
was
no
longer
in
a
runaway
but
only
for
a
moment
did
they
hesitate
before
taking
up
the
new
chant
looky
looky
he
s
throwed
merton
right
off
into
the
dirt
he
s
throwed
merton
right
off
into
the
dirt
oh
looky
merton
gill
right
down
there
in
the
dirt
again
they
had
become
exact
merton
was
right
down
there
in
the
dirt
and
a
frantic
dexter
was
vanishing
up
the
alley
at
the
head
of
a
cloud
of
dust
the
friendly
ransom
tots
leaped
from
the
fence
to
the
alley
forgetting
on
her
bed
of
pain
the
mother
who
supposed
them
to
be
engrossed
with
picture
books
in
the
library
with
one
accord
they
ran
toward
the
prostrate
horseman
calvin
ahead
and
elsie
a
close
second
holding
the
hand
of
little
woodrow
they
were
presently
able
to
observe
that
the
fleeing
dexter
had
narrowly
escaped
running
down
a
motor
car
inopportunely
turning
at
that
moment
into
the
alley
the
gallant
animal
swerved
in
time
leaving
the
car
s
driver
and
his
wife
aghast
at
their
slight
margin
of
safety
dexter
vanished
to
the
right
up
shaded
spruce
street
on
a
sabbath
evening
as
the
first
call
to
evening
worship
pealed
from
a
neighbouring
church
tower
his
late
rider
had
erected
himself
and
was
beating
dust
from
the
new
chaps
and
the
front
of
the
new
shirt
he
picked
up
the
ideal
hat
and
dusted
that
underneath
all
the
flurry
of
this
adventure
he
was
still
the
artist
he
had
been
set
afoot
in
the
desert
by
a
treacherous
horse
he
must
find
a
water
hole
or
perish
with
thirst
he
replaced
the
hat
and
it
was
then
he
observed
the
motor
car
bearing
down
the
alley
upon
him
my
good
gosh
he
muttered
the
gashwilers
had
returned
a
full
two
hours
before
their
accustomed
time
the
car
halted
beside
him
and
his
employer
leaned
out
a
warmly
hostile
face
what
s
this
mean
he
demanded
the
time
was
not
one
to
tell
gashwiler
what
he
thought
of
him
not
only
was
there
a
lady
present
but
he
felt
himself
at
a
disadvantage
the
lady
saved
him
from
an
instant
necessity
for
words
that
was
our
new
clothesline
i
recognized
it
at
the
woman
seemed
to
pride
herself
on
this
paltry
feat
what
s
this
mean
again
demanded
gashwiler
he
was
now
a
man
of
one
idea
again
was
merton
gill
saved
from
the
need
of
instant
speech
though
not
in
a
way
he
would
have
chosen
to
be
saved
the
three
ransom
children
ran
up
breathless
shouting
oh
merton
here
s
your
pistol
i
found
it
right
in
the
road
we
found
your
pistol
right
in
the
dirt
there
i
saw
it
you
did
not
i
saw
it
first
merton
will
you
let
me
shoot
it
off
merton
i
found
your
pistol
didn
t
i
merton
didn
t
i
find
it
right
in
the
road
there
the
friendly
tots
did
little
step
dances
while
they
were
thus
vocal
be
quiet
children
commanded
merton
finding
a
voice
but
they
were
not
to
be
quelled
by
mere
tones
he
throwed
merton
right
off
into
the
dirt
didn
t
he
merton
merton
didn
t
he
throw
you
right
off
into
the
dirt
merton
did
he
hurt
you
merton
merton
will
you
let
me
shoot
it
off
just
once
just
once
and
i
ll
never
ask
again
he
didn
t
either
find
it
first
he
throwed
you
off
right
into
the
dirt
didn
t
he
throw
you
right
off
into
the
dirt
merton
with
a
harsher
show
of
authority
or
perhaps
merely
because
he
was
bearded
so
unreasoning
are
the
inhibitions
of
the
young
gashwiler
stilled
the
tumult
the
dancing
died
what
s
this
mean
he
repeated
we
nearly
had
an
accident
said
the
lady
what
s
this
mean
an
answer
of
sorts
could
no
longer
be
delayed
well
i
thought
i
d
give
dexter
a
little
exercise
so
i
saddled
him
up
and
was
going
to
ride
him
around
the
block
when
when
these
kids
here
yelled
and
scared
him
so
he
ran
oh
what
a
story
shouted
the
tots
in
unison
what
a
bad
story
you
ll
go
to
the
bad
place
intoned
little
elsie
i
swear
i
don
t
know
what
s
gettin
into
you
declared
gashwiler
don
t
that
horse
get
exercise
enough
during
the
week
don
t
he
like
his
day
of
rest
how
d
you
like
me
to
saddle
you
up
and
ride
you
round
the
block
i
guess
you
d
like
that
pretty
well
wouldn
t
you
gashwiler
fancied
himself
in
this
bit
of
sarcasm
brutal
though
it
was
he
toyed
with
it
next
sunday
i
ll
saddle
you
up
and
ride
you
round
the
block
see
how
you
like
that
young
it
was
our
clothesline
said
the
lady
i
could
tell
it
right
with
a
womanish
tenacity
she
had
fastened
to
a
minor
inconsequence
of
the
outrage
gashwiler
became
practical
well
i
must
say
it
s
a
pretty
that
horse
ll
make
straight
back
for
the
farm
we
won
t
have
any
delivery
horse
sue
you
get
out
i
ll
go
down
the
road
a
piece
and
see
if
i
can
head
him
he
turned
the
other
way
said
merton
well
he
s
bound
to
head
around
for
the
farm
i
ll
go
up
the
road
and
you
hurry
out
the
way
he
went
mebbe
you
can
catch
him
before
he
gets
out
of
gashwiler
descended
from
the
car
you
better
have
that
clothesline
back
by
seven
o
clock
morning
she
warned
the
offender
yes
ma
am
i
this
was
not
spoken
in
a
buck
benson
manner
and
say
gashwiler
paused
in
turning
the
car
what
you
doing
in
that
outlandish
rig
anyhow
must
think
you
re
one
o
them
wild
west
cowboys
or
something
huh
this
last
carried
a
sneer
that
stung
well
i
guess
i
can
pick
out
my
own
clothes
if
i
want
fine
things
to
call
clothes
i
must
say
well
go
see
if
you
can
pick
out
that
horse
if
you
re
such
a
good
again
gashwiler
was
pleased
with
himself
he
could
play
venomously
with
words
yes
sir
said
merton
and
plodded
on
up
the
alley
followed
at
a
respectful
distance
by
the
ransom
kiddies
who
at
once
resumed
their
vocal
exercises
he
throwed
you
off
right
into
the
dirt
didn
t
he
merton
didn
t
he
throw
you
off
right
into
the
dirt
if
it
were
inevitable
he
wished
that
they
would
come
closer
he
would
even
have
taken
little
woodrow
by
the
hand
but
they
kept
far
enough
back
of
him
to
require
that
their
voices
should
be
raised
incessantly
the
pitiless
rain
fell
upon
him
he
throwed
you
off
right
into
the
dirt
didn
t
he
merton
he
turned
out
of
the
alley
up
spruce
street
the
ransom
children
lawlessly
followed
forgetting
their
good
home
their
poor
sick
mother
and
the
rules
she
had
laid
down
for
their
sabbath
recreation
at
every
moment
the
shrill
cry
reached
his
burning
ears
didn
t
he
throw
you
off
the
kiddies
appeared
to
believe
that
merton
had
not
heard
them
but
they
were
patient
presently
he
would
hear
and
reassure
them
that
he
had
indeed
been
thrown
off
right
into
the
dirt
now
he
began
to
meet
or
pass
early
churchgoers
who
would
gaze
at
him
in
wonder
or
in
frank
criticism
he
left
the
sidewalk
and
sought
the
centre
of
the
road
pretending
that
out
there
he
could
better
search
for
a
valuable
lost
horse
the
ransom
children
were
at
first
in
two
minds
about
following
him
but
they
soon
found
it
more
interesting
to
stay
on
the
sidewalk
they
could
pause
to
acquaint
the
churchgoers
with
a
matter
of
common
interest
he
throwed
merton
off
right
into
the
if
the
people
they
addressed
appeared
to
be
doubting
this
or
to
find
it
not
specific
enough
they
would
call
ahead
to
merton
to
confirm
their
simple
tale
with
rapt
shining
faces
they
spread
the
glad
news
though
hurrying
always
to
keep
pace
with
the
figure
in
the
road
spruce
street
was
vacant
of
dexter
but
up
elm
street
slowly
cropping
the
wayside
herbage
as
he
went
was
undoubtedly
merton
s
good
old
pal
he
quickened
his
pace
dexter
seemed
to
divine
his
coming
and
broke
into
a
kittenish
gallop
until
he
reached
the
methodist
church
here
appearing
to
believe
that
he
had
again
eluded
pursuit
he
stopped
to
graze
on
a
carefully
tended
square
of
grass
before
the
sacred
edifice
he
was
at
once
shooed
by
two
scandalized
old
ladies
but
paid
them
no
attention
they
might
perhaps
even
have
tickled
him
for
this
was
the
best
grass
he
had
found
since
leaving
home
other
churchgoers
paused
in
consternation
looking
expectantly
at
the
approaching
merton
gill
the
three
happy
children
who
came
up
with
him
left
no
one
in
doubt
of
the
late
happening
merton
was
still
the
artist
he
saw
himself
approach
dexter
vault
into
the
saddle
put
spurs
to
the
beast
and
swiftly
disappear
down
the
street
people
would
be
saying
that
he
should
not
be
let
to
ride
so
fast
through
a
city
street
he
was
worse
than
gus
giddings
but
he
saw
this
only
with
his
artist
s
eye
in
sordid
fact
he
went
up
to
dexter
seized
the
trailing
bridle
reins
and
jerked
savagely
upon
them
back
over
the
trail
he
led
his
good
old
pal
and
for
other
later
churchgoers
there
were
the
shrill
voices
of
friendly
children
to
tell
what
had
happened
to
appeal
confidently
to
merton
vaguely
ahead
in
the
twilight
to
confirm
their
interesting
story
dexter
the
anarchist
was
put
to
bed
without
his
goodnight
kiss
good
old
pinto
had
done
his
pal
dirt
never
again
would
he
be
given
a
part
in
buck
benson
s
company
across
the
alley
came
the
voices
of
tired
happy
children
in
the
appeal
for
an
encore
please
let
him
do
it
to
you
please
let
him
do
it
to
you
and
to
the
back
porch
came
gashwiler
to
say
it
was
a
good
thing
he
d
got
that
clothesline
back
and
came
her
husband
wishing
to
be
told
what
outlandish
notion
merton
gill
would
next
get
into
the
thing
he
called
his
head
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
followed
a
week
of
strained
relations
with
the
gashwiler
household
including
dexter
and
another
week
of
relations
hardly
more
cordial
but
thirty
dollars
was
added
to
the
hoard
which
was
now
counted
almost
nightly
and
the
cruder
wits
of
the
village
had
made
rather
a
joke
of
merton
s
adventure
some
were
tasteless
enough
to
rally
him
coarsely
upon
the
crowded
street
or
at
the
post
office
while
he
awaited
his
magazines
and
now
there
were
two
hundred
and
dollars
to
put
him
forever
beyond
their
jibes
he
carefully
rehearsed
a
scathing
speech
for
gashwiler
he
would
tell
him
what
he
thought
of
him
that
merchant
would
learn
from
it
some
things
that
would
do
him
good
if
he
believed
them
but
probably
he
wouldn
t
believe
them
he
would
also
see
that
he
had
done
his
faithful
employee
grave
injustices
and
he
would
be
left
in
some
humiliation
having
found
as
merton
gill
took
himself
forever
out
of
retail
trade
that
two
could
play
on
words
as
well
as
one
it
was
a
good
warm
speech
and
its
author
knew
every
word
of
it
from
mumbled
rehearsal
during
the
two
weeks
at
times
when
gashwiler
merely
thought
he
was
being
queer
again
at
last
came
the
day
when
he
decided
to
recite
it
in
full
to
the
man
for
whom
it
had
been
composed
he
confronted
him
accordingly
at
a
dull
moment
on
the
third
monday
morning
burning
with
his
message
he
looked
gashwiler
firmly
in
the
eye
and
said
in
halting
tones
mr
gashwiler
now
i
ve
been
thinking
i
d
like
to
go
west
for
a
while
to
california
if
you
could
arrange
to
let
me
off
and
gashwiler
had
replied
well
now
that
is
a
surprise
when
was
you
wishing
to
go
merton
why
i
would
be
much
obliged
if
you
d
let
me
get
off
on
no
gashwiler
and
i
know
you
can
get
spencer
grant
to
take
my
place
because
i
asked
him
very
well
merton
send
spencer
grant
in
to
see
me
and
you
can
get
off
i

no
was
made
to
stop
at
simsbury
for
a
young
man
who
was
presently
commanding
a
meal
in
the
palatial
diner
and
who
had
before
this
meal
was
eaten
looked
out
with
compassion
upon
two
hamlets
that
the
train
rushed
by
a
blur
of
standing
on
their
depot
platforms
to
envy
the
inmates
of
that
splendid
structure
at
last
it
was
western
stuff
and
no
fooling
chapter
iv
the
watcher
at
the
gate
the
street
leading
to
the
holden
studio
considered
by
itself
lacks
beauty
flanking
it
for
most
of
the
way
from
the
boulevard
to
the
studio
gate
are
vacant
lots
labelled
with
their
prices
and
appeals
to
the
passer
to
buy
them
still
their
prices
are
high
enough
to
mark
the
thoroughfare
as
one
out
of
the
common
and
it
is
further
distinguished
by
two
rows
of
lofty
eucalyptus
trees
these
have
a
real
feathery
beauty
and
are
perhaps
a
factor
in
the
seemingly
exorbitant
prices
demanded
for
the
choice
bungalow
and
home
sites
they
shade
save
for
a
casual
pioneer
bungalow
or
two
there
are
no
buildings
to
attract
the
notice
until
one
reaches
a
high
fence
that
marks
the
beginning
of
the
holden
lot
back
of
this
fence
is
secreted
a
microcosmos
a
world
in
little
where
one
may
encounter
strange
races
of
people
in
their
native
dress
and
behold
by
walking
a
block
cities
actually
apart
by
league
upon
league
of
the
earth
s
surface
and
separated
by
centuries
of
time
to
penetrate
this
city
of
many
cities
and
this
actual
present
of
the
remote
past
one
must
be
of
a
certain
inner
elect
hardly
may
one
enter
by
assuming
the
disguise
of
a
native
as
daring
explorers
have
sometimes
overcome
the
difficulty
of
entering
other
strange
cities
its
gate
reached
after
passing
along
an
impressive
expanse
of
the
reticent
fence
is
watched
by
a
guardian
he
is
a
stoatish
man
of
middle
age
not
neatly
dressed
and
of
forbidding
aspect
his
face
is
ruthless
with
a
very
knowing
cynicism
he
is
there
it
would
seem
chiefly
to
keep
people
out
of
the
delightful
city
though
from
time
to
time
he
will
bow
an
assent
or
wave
it
with
the
hand
clutching
his
evening
newspaper
to
one
of
the
favoured
lawful
inmates
who
will
then
carelessly
saunter
or
drive
an
expensive
motor
car
through
the
difficult
portal
standing
across
the
street
one
may
peer
through
this
portal
into
an
avenue
of
the
forbidden
city
there
is
an
exciting
glimpse
of
greensward
flowering
shrubbery
roses
vines
and
a
vista
of
the
ends
of
enormous
structures
painted
yellow
and
this
avenue
is
sprightly
with
the
passing
of
enviable
persons
who
are
rightly
there
some
in
alien
garb
some
in
the
duller
uniform
of
the
humble
artisan
some
in
the
pressed
and
garnished
trappings
of
rich
overlords
it
is
really
best
to
stand
across
the
street
for
this
clandestine
view
of
delights
if
you
stand
close
to
the
gate
to
peer
past
the
bulky
shape
of
the
warder
he
is
likely
to
turn
and
give
you
a
cold
look
further
he
is
averse
to
light
conversation
being
always
morosely
absorbed
yet
with
an
eye
ever
alert
for
intrusive
outlanders
in
his
evening
paper
he
never
reads
a
morning
paper
but
has
some
means
of
obtaining
at
an
early
hour
each
morning
a
pink
or
green
evening
paper
that
shrieks
with
crimson
headlines
such
has
been
his
reading
through
all
time
and
this
may
have
been
an
element
in
shaping
his
now
inveterate
hostility
toward
those
who
would
engage
him
in
meaningless
talk
even
in
accepting
the
gift
of
an
excellent
cigar
he
betrays
only
a
bored
condescension
there
is
no
relenting
of
countenance
no
genial
relaxing
of
an
ingrained
suspicion
toward
all
who
approach
him
no
cordiality
in
short
such
as
would
lead
you
to
believe
that
he
might
be
glad
to
look
over
a
bunch
of
stills
taken
by
the
most
artistic
photographer
in
all
simsbury
illinois
so
you
let
him
severely
alone
after
a
bit
and
go
to
stand
across
the
street
your
neatly
wrapped
art
studies
under
your
arm
and
leaning
against
the
trunk
of
a
eucalyptus
tree
you
stare
brazenly
past
him
into
the
city
of
wonders
it
is
thus
we
first
observe
that
rising
young
screen
actor
clifford
armytage
beginning
the
tenth
day
of
his
determined
effort
to
become
much
more
closely
identified
with
screen
activities
than
hitherto
ten
days
of
waiting
outside
the
guarded
gate
had
been
his
but
no
other
ten
days
of
his
life
had
seemed
so
eventful
or
passed
so
swiftly
for
at
last
he
stood
before
his
goal
had
actually
fastened
his
eyes
upon
so
much
of
it
as
might
be
seen
through
its
gate
never
had
he
achieved
so
much
downright
actuality
back
in
simsbury
on
a
sunday
morning
he
had
often
strolled
over
to
the
depot
at
early
train
time
for
a
sight
of
the
two
metal
containers
housing
the
films
shown
at
the
bijou
palace
the
day
before
they
would
be
on
the
platform
pasted
over
with
express
labels
he
would
stand
by
them
even
touch
them
examine
the
padlocks
turn
them
over
heft
them
actually
hold
within
his
grasp
the
film
wraith
of
beulah
baxter
in
a
terrific
installment
of
the
hazards
of
hortense
those
metal
containers
imprisoned
so
much
of
beauty
of
daring
of
young
love
striving
against
adverse
currents
held
the
triumphant
fruiting
of
miss
baxter
s
toil
and
struggle
and
sacrifice
to
give
the
public
something
better
and
finer
often
he
had
caressed
the
crude
metal
with
a
reverent
hand
as
if
his
wonder
woman
herself
stood
there
to
receive
his
homage
that
was
actuality
in
a
way
but
here
it
was
in
full
measure
without
mental
subterfuge
or
vain
imaginings
had
he
not
beheld
from
this
post
he
was
pretty
sure
he
had
miss
baxter
herself
swathed
in
costly
furs
drive
a
robin
roadster
through
the
gate
without
even
a
nod
to
the
warder
indeed
that
one
glimpse
of
reality
had
been
worth
his
ten
days
of
waiting
worth
all
his
watching
of
the
gate
and
its
keeper
until
he
knew
every
dent
in
the
keeper
s
derby
hat
every
bristle
in
his
unkempt
mustache
every
wrinkle
of
his
inferior
raiment
and
every
pocket
from
which
throughout
the
day
he
would
vainly
draw
matches
to
relight
an
apparently
fireproof
cigar
surely
waiting
thus
rewarded
could
not
be
called
barren
when
he
grew
tired
of
standing
he
could
cross
the
street
and
rest
on
a
low
bench
that
encircled
one
of
the
eucalyptus
trees
here
were
other
waiters
without
the
pale
usually
men
of
strongly
marked
features
with
a
tendency
to
extremes
in
stature
or
hair
or
beards
or
noses
and
not
conspicuously
neat
in
attire
these
he
discovered
were
extras
awaiting
employment
many
of
them
mexicans
or
mongrels
with
a
sprinkling
of
negroes
often
he
could
have
recruited
there
a
band
of
outlaws
for
desperate
deeds
over
the
border
he
did
not
fraternize
with
these
waifs
feeling
that
his
was
another
plane
he
had
spent
three
days
thus
about
the
studio
gate
when
he
learned
of
the
existence
of
another
entrance
this
was
a
door
almost
opposite
the
bench
he
ventured
through
it
and
discovered
a
bare
room
with
a
wooden
seat
running
about
its
sides
in
a
partition
opposite
the
entrance
was
a
small
window
and
over
it
the
words
casting
one
of
the
two
other
doors
led
to
the
interior
and
through
this
he
observed
pass
many
of
the
chosen
another
door
led
to
the
office
of
the
casting
director
glimpses
of
which
could
be
obtained
through
the
little
window
the
waiting
room
itself
was
not
only
bare
as
to
floor
and
walls
but
was
bleak
and
inhospitable
in
its
general
effect
the
wooden
seat
was
uncomfortable
and
those
who
sat
upon
it
along
the
walls
appeared
depressed
and
unhopeful
especially
after
they
had
braved
a
talk
through
the
little
window
with
someone
who
seemed
always
to
be
saying
no
nothing
yes
perhaps
next
week
i
have
your
when
the
aspirants
were
women
as
they
mostly
were
the
someone
back
of
the
window
would
add
dear
to
the
speech
no
nothing
there
seemed
never
to
be
anything
and
clifford
armytage
spent
very
little
of
his
waiting
time
in
this
room
it
made
him
uncomfortable
to
be
stared
at
by
other
applicants
whether
they
stared
casually
incuriously
or
whether
they
seemed
to
appraise
him
disparagingly
as
if
telling
him
frankly
that
for
him
there
would
never
be
anything
then
he
saw
that
he
too
must
undergo
that
encounter
at
the
little
window
too
apparently
he
was
not
getting
anywhere
by
loitering
about
outside
it
was
exciting
but
the
producers
would
hardly
look
there
for
new
talent
he
chose
a
moment
for
this
encounter
when
the
waiting
room
was
vacant
not
caring
to
be
stared
at
when
he
took
this
first
step
in
forming
a
connection
that
was
to
be
notable
in
screen
annals
he
approached
the
window
bent
his
head
and
encountered
the
gaze
of
a
small
comely
woman
with
warm
brown
eyes
neat
reddish
hair
and
a
quick
manner
the
gaze
was
shrewd
it
seemed
to
read
all
that
was
needed
to
be
known
of
this
new
candidate
yes
said
the
woman
she
looked
tired
and
very
businesslike
but
her
manner
was
not
unkind
the
novice
was
at
once
reassured
he
was
presently
explaining
to
her
that
he
wished
to
act
in
the
pictures
at
this
particular
studio
no
he
had
not
had
much
experience
that
is
you
could
hardly
call
it
experience
in
actual
acting
but
he
had
finished
a
course
of
study
and
had
a
diploma
from
the
general
film
production
company
of
stebbinsville
arkansas
certifying
him
to
be
a
competent
screen
actor
and
of
course
he
would
not
at
first
expect
a
big
part
he
would
be
glad
to
take
a
small
part
to
begin
with
almost
any
small
part
until
he
could
familiarize
himself
with
studio
conditions
and
here
was
a
bunch
of
stills
that
would
give
any
one
an
idea
of
the
range
of
parts
he
was
prepared
to
play
society
parts
in
a
suit
or
soldier
parts
in
a
trench
coat
and
lieutenant
s
cap
or
juveniles
in
the
natty
suit
with
the
belted
coat
and
in
the
model
belted
overcoat
and
of
course
western
stuff
these
would
give
an
idea
of
what
he
could
do
cowboy
outfit
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
chaps
and
spurs
and
guns
and
so
forth
and
he
was
prepared
to
work
hard
and
struggle
and
sacrifice
in
order
to
give
the
public
something
better
and
finer
and
would
it
be
possible
to
secure
some
small
part
at
once
was
a
good
actor
by
any
chance
at
that
moment
needed
in
the
company
of
miss
beulah
baxter
because
he
would
especially
like
such
a
part
and
he
would
be
ready
to
start
to
work
at
any
time
or
even
the
tired
little
woman
beyond
the
opening
listened
patiently
to
this
interrupting
several
times
to
say
over
an
insistent
telephone
no
nothing
she
looked
at
the
stills
with
evident
interest
and
curiously
studied
the
face
of
the
speaker
as
she
listened
she
smiled
wearily
when
he
was
through
and
spoke
briskly
now
i
ll
tell
you
son
all
that
is
very
nice
but
you
haven
t
had
a
lick
of
real
experience
yet
have
you
and
things
are
pretty
quiet
on
the
lot
just
now
there
are
only
two
companies
shooting
so
you
couldn
t
get
anything
or
or
probably
for
a
good
many
days
after
that
and
it
won
t
be
much
when
you
get
it
you
may
get
on
as
an
extra
after
a
while
when
some
of
the
other
companies
start
shooting
but
i
can
t
promise
anything
you
understand
what
you
do
now
leave
me
your
name
and
address
and
telephone
yes
ma
am
said
the
applicant
and
supplied
these
data
clifford
armytage
exclaimed
the
woman
i
ll
say
that
s
some
warm
name
well
you
see
he
paused
but
resolved
to
confide
freely
in
this
friendly
seeming
person
you
see
i
picked
that
out
for
a
good
name
to
act
under
it
sounds
good
doesn
t
it
and
my
own
right
name
is
only
merton
gill
so
i
thought
i
d
better
have
something
that
sounded
a
little
more
well
you
sure
said
the
woman
all
right
have
any
name
you
want
but
i
think
i
ll
call
you
merton
when
you
come
again
you
needn
t
act
with
me
you
know
now
let
s
see
name
age
height
good
general
wardrobe
house
address
telephone
number
oh
yes
tell
me
where
i
can
find
you
during
the
right
out
here
he
replied
firmly
i
m
going
to
stick
to
this
studio
and
not
go
near
any
of
the
others
if
i
m
not
in
this
room
i
ll
be
just
outside
there
on
that
bench
around
the
tree
or
just
across
the
street
where
you
can
see
through
the
gate
and
watch
the
people
go
say
again
the
woman
searched
his
face
and
broke
into
her
friendly
smile
say
you
re
a
real
nut
aren
t
you
how
d
you
ever
get
this
way
and
again
he
was
talking
telling
now
of
his
past
and
his
struggles
to
educate
himself
as
a
screen
actor
one
of
the
best
he
spoke
of
simsbury
and
gashwiler
and
of
lowell
hardy
who
took
his
stills
and
of
tessie
kearns
whose
sympathy
and
advice
had
done
so
much
to
encourage
him
the
woman
was
joyously
attentive
now
she
did
more
than
smile
she
laughed
at
intervals
throughout
the
narrative
though
her
laughter
seemed
entirely
sympathetic
and
in
no
way
daunted
the
speaker
well
merton
you
re
a
funny
one
i
ll
say
that
you
re
so
kind
of
ignorant
and
appealing
and
you
say
this
bughalter
or
gigwater
or
whatever
his
name
is
will
take
you
back
into
the
store
any
time
well
that
s
a
good
thing
to
remember
because
the
picture
game
is
a
hard
game
i
wouldn
t
discourage
a
nice
clean
boy
like
you
for
the
world
but
there
are
a
lot
of
people
in
pictures
right
now
that
would
prefer
a
steady
job
like
that
one
you
it
s
gashwiler
that
oh
all
right
just
so
you
don
t
forget
it
and
forget
the
the
new
applicant
warmly
reassured
her
i
wouldn
t
be
likely
to
forget
that
after
living
there
all
those
when
he
left
the
window
the
woman
was
again
saying
into
the
telephone
no
dear
nothing
i
m
it
was
that
night
he
wrote
to
tessie
kearns
dear
friend
tessie
well
tessie
here
i
am
safe
and
sound
in
hollywood
after
a
long
ride
on
the
cars
that
went
through
many
strange
and
interesting
cities
and
different
parts
of
the
country
and
i
guess
by
this
time
you
must
have
thought
i
was
forgetting
my
old
friends
back
in
simsbury
but
not
so
i
can
assure
you
for
i
will
never
forget
our
long
talks
together
and
how
you
cheered
me
up
often
when
the
sacrifice
and
struggle
seemed
more
than
any
man
could
bear
but
now
i
feel
repaid
for
all
that
sacrifice
and
struggle
for
i
am
here
where
the
pictures
are
made
and
soon
i
will
be
acting
different
parts
in
them
though
things
are
quiet
on
the
lot
now
with
only
two
companies
shooting
but
more
companies
will
be
shooting
in
a
few
days
more
and
then
will
come
the
great
opportunity
for
me
as
soon
as
i
get
known
and
my
different
capabilities
and
what
i
can
do
and
everything
i
had
a
long
talk
with
the
lady
out
in
front
that
hires
the
actors
and
she
was
very
friendly
but
said
it
might
be
quite
some
time
because
only
two
companies
on
the
lot
were
shooting
and
she
said
if
gashwiler
had
promised
to
keep
my
old
job
for
me
to
be
sure
and
not
forget
his
address
and
it
was
laughable
that
she
should
say
such
a
thing
because
i
would
not
be
liable
to
forget
his
address
when
i
lived
there
so
long
she
must
have
thought
i
was
very
forgetful
to
forget
that
address
there
is
some
great
scenery
around
this
place
including
many
of
the
rocky
mtns
etc
that
make
it
look
beautiful
and
the
city
of
los
angeles
is
bigger
than
peoria
i
am
quite
some
distance
out
of
the
centre
of
town
and
i
have
a
nice
furnished
room
about
a
mile
from
the
holden
studios
where
i
will
be
hired
after
a
few
more
companies
get
to
shooting
on
the
lot
there
is
an
electric
iron
in
the
kitchen
where
one
can
press
their
clothes
and
my
furnished
room
is
in
the
house
of
a
los
angeles
society
woman
and
her
husband
who
came
here
from
iowa
their
little
house
with
flowers
in
front
of
it
is
called
a
bungalow
the
husband
patterson
had
a
farm
in
iowa
six
miles
out
from
cedar
falls
and
he
cares
little
for
society
but
the
wife
goes
into
society
all
the
time
as
there
is
hardly
a
day
just
now
that
some
society
does
not
have
its
picnic
and
one
day
it
will
be
the
kansas
society
picnic
and
the
next
day
it
will
be
the
michigan
society
having
a
picnic
or
some
other
state
and
of
course
the
iowa
society
that
has
the
biggest
picnic
of
all
and
patterson
says
his
wife
can
go
to
all
these
society
functions
if
she
wants
but
he
does
not
care
much
for
society
and
he
is
thinking
of
buying
a
half
interest
in
a
good
place
just
to
pass
the
time
away
as
he
says
after
the
busy
life
he
has
led
he
needs
something
to
keep
him
busy
but
his
wife
thinks
only
of
society
i
take
my
meals
out
at
different
places
especially
at
drug
stores
i
guess
you
would
be
surprised
to
see
these
drug
stores
where
you
can
go
in
and
sit
at
the
soda
counter
and
order
your
coffee
and
sandwiches
and
custard
pie
and
eat
them
right
there
in
the
drug
store
but
there
are
other
places
too
like
cafeterias
where
you
put
your
dishes
on
a
tray
and
carry
it
to
your
own
table
it
is
all
quite
different
from
simsbury
and
i
have
seen
oranges
growing
on
the
trees
and
there
are
palm
trees
and
it
does
not
snow
here
but
the
grass
is
green
and
the
flowers
bloom
right
through
the
winter
which
makes
it
very
attractive
with
the
rocky
mtns
standing
up
in
the
distance
etc
well
tessie
you
must
excuse
this
long
letter
from
your
old
friend
and
write
me
if
any
company
has
accepted
passion
s
perils
and
i
might
have
a
chance
to
act
in
that
some
day
and
i
will
let
you
know
when
my
first
picture
is
released
and
the
title
of
it
so
you
can
watch
out
for
it
when
it
comes
to
the
bijou
palace
i
often
think
of
the
old
town
and
would
like
to
have
a
chat
with
you
and
my
other
old
friends
but
i
am
not
homesick
only
sometimes
i
would
like
to
be
back
there
as
there
are
not
many
people
to
chat
with
here
and
one
would
almost
be
lonesome
sometimes
if
they
could
not
be
at
the
studio
but
i
must
remember
that
work
and
struggle
and
sacrifice
are
necessary
to
give
the
public
something
better
and
finer
and
become
a
good
screen
actor
so
no
more
at
present
from
your
old
friend
and
address
clifford
armytage
at
above
number
as
i
am
going
by
my
stage
name
though
the
lady
at
the
holden
lot
said
she
liked
my
old
name
better
and
called
me
that
and
it
sounded
pretty
good
as
i
have
not
got
used
to
the
stage
name
yet
he
felt
better
after
this
chat
with
his
old
friend
and
the
following
morning
he
pressed
a
suit
in
the
patterson
kitchen
and
resumed
his
vigil
outside
the
gate
but
now
from
time
to
time
at
least
twice
a
day
he
could
break
the
monotony
of
this
by
a
call
at
the
little
window
sometimes
the
woman
beyond
it
would
be
engrossed
with
the
telephone
and
would
merely
look
at
him
to
shake
her
head
at
others
the
telephone
being
still
she
would
engage
him
in
friendly
talk
she
seemed
to
like
him
as
an
occasional
caller
but
she
remained
smilingly
skeptical
about
his
immediate
success
in
the
pictures
again
and
again
she
urged
him
not
to
forget
the
address
of
giggenholder
or
gooshswamp
or
whoever
it
might
be
that
was
holding
a
good
job
for
him
he
never
failed
to
remind
her
that
the
name
was
gashwiler
and
that
he
could
not
possibly
forget
the
address
because
he
had
lived
at
simsbury
a
long
time
this
always
seemed
to
brighten
the
woman
s
day
it
puzzled
him
to
note
that
for
some
reason
his
earnest
assurance
pleased
her
as
the
days
of
waiting
passed
he
began
to
distinguish
individuals
among
the
people
who
went
through
the
little
outer
room
or
sat
patiently
around
its
walls
on
the
hard
bench
waiting
like
himself
for
more
companies
to
start
shooting
among
the
men
that
passed
through
would
be
actors
that
were
now
reaping
the
reward
of
their
struggle
and
sacrifice
actors
whom
he
thrilled
to
recognize
as
old
screen
friends
these
would
saunter
in
with
an
air
of
fine
leisure
and
their
manner
of
careless
but
elegant
dress
would
be
keenly
noted
by
merton
then
there
were
directors
these
were
often
less
scrupulously
attired
and
seemed
always
to
be
solving
knotty
problems
they
passed
hurriedly
on
brows
drawn
in
perplexity
they
were
very
busy
persons
those
on
the
bench
regarded
them
with
deep
respect
and
stiffened
to
attention
as
they
passed
but
they
were
never
observed
by
these
great
ones
the
waiting
ones
were
of
all
ages
mostly
women
with
but
a
sprinkling
of
men
many
of
the
women
were
young
or
youngish
and
of
rare
beauty
so
merton
gill
thought
others
were
elderly
or
old
and
a
few
would
be
accompanied
by
children
often
so
young
that
they
must
be
held
on
laps
they
too
waited
with
round
eyes
and
in
perfect
decorum
for
a
chance
to
act
sometimes
the
little
window
would
be
pushed
open
and
a
woman
beckoned
from
the
bench
some
of
them
greeted
the
casting
director
as
an
old
friend
and
were
still
gay
when
told
that
there
was
nothing
others
seemed
to
dread
being
told
this
and
would
wait
on
without
daring
an
inquiry
sometimes
there
would
be
a
little
flurry
of
actual
business
four
society
women
would
be
needed
for
a
bridge
table
at
the
next
morning
on
stage
number
five
the
casting
director
seemed
to
know
the
wardrobe
of
each
of
the
waiters
and
would
select
the
four
quickly
the
gowns
must
be
smart
it
was
at
the
country
house
of
a
rich
new
yorker
and
jewels
and
furs
were
not
to
be
forgotten
there
might
be
two
days
work
the
four
fortunate
ladies
would
depart
with
cheerful
smiles
the
remaining
waiters
settled
on
the
bench
hoping
against
hope
for
another
call
among
the
hopefuls
merton
had
come
to
know
by
sight
the
montague
family
this
consisted
of
a
handsome
elderly
gentleman
of
most
impressive
manner
his
wife
a
portly
woman
of
middle
age
also
possessing
an
impressive
manner
and
a
daughter
montague
always
removed
his
hat
in
the
waiting
room
uncovering
an
abundant
cluster
of
curls
above
a
noble
brow
about
him
there
seemed
ever
to
linger
a
faint
spicy
aroma
of
strong
drink
and
he
would
talk
freely
to
those
sharing
the
bench
with
him
his
voice
was
full
and
rich
in
tone
and
his
speech
deliberate
and
precise
more
than
hinted
that
he
had
once
been
an
ornament
of
the
speaking
stage
his
wife
also
was
friendly
of
manner
and
spoke
in
a
deep
contralto
somewhat
roughened
by
wear
but
still
notable
the
daughter
merton
did
not
like
she
was
not
unattractive
in
appearance
though
her
features
were
far
off
the
model
her
nose
being
too
short
her
mouth
too
large
her
cheekbones
too
prominent
and
her
chin
too
square
indeed
she
resembled
too
closely
her
father
who
as
a
man
could
carry
such
things
more
becomingly
she
was
a
slangy
chit
much
too
free
and
easy
in
her
ways
merton
considered
and
revealing
a
that
amounted
almost
to
impudence
further
her
cheeks
were
brown
her
brief
nose
freckled
and
she
did
not
take
the
pains
with
her
face
that
most
of
the
beautiful
young
women
who
waited
there
had
so
obviously
taken
she
was
a
baggage
with
no
proper
respect
for
any
one
he
decided
especially
after
the
day
she
had
so
rudely
accosted
one
of
the
passing
directors
he
was
a
more
than
usually
absorbed
director
and
with
drawn
brows
would
have
gone
unseeing
through
the
waiting
room
when
the
girl
hailed
him
oh
henshaw
one
moment
please
he
glanced
up
in
some
annoyance
pausing
with
his
hand
to
the
door
that
led
on
to
his
proper
realm
oh
it
s
you
miss
montague
well
what
is
it
i
m
very
very
well
it
s
something
i
wanted
to
ask
she
quickly
crossed
the
room
to
stand
by
him
tenderly
flecking
a
bit
of
dust
from
his
coat
sleeve
as
she
began
say
listen
henshaw
do
you
think
beauty
is
a
curse
to
a
poor
girl
henshaw
scowled
down
into
the
eyes
so
confidingly
lifted
to
his
that
s
something
you
won
t
ever
have
to
worry
about
he
snapped
and
was
gone
his
brows
again
drawn
in
perplexity
over
his
work
you
re
not
angry
with
poor
little
me
are
you
henshaw
the
girl
called
this
after
him
and
listened
but
no
reply
came
from
back
of
the
partition
montague
from
the
bench
rebuked
her
daughter
say
what
do
you
think
that
kidding
stuff
will
get
you
don
t
you
want
to
work
for
him
any
more
the
girl
turned
pleading
eyes
upon
her
mother
i
think
he
might
have
answered
a
simple
question
said
she
this
was
all
distasteful
to
merton
gill
the
girl
might
indeed
have
deserved
an
answer
to
her
simple
question
but
why
need
she
ask
it
of
so
busy
a
man
he
felt
that
henshaw
s
rebuke
was
well
merited
for
her
own
beauty
was
surely
not
excessive
her
father
from
the
bench
likewise
admonished
her
you
are
sadly
prone
to
a
spirit
of
banter
he
declared
though
i
admit
that
the
art
of
the
motion
picture
is
not
to
be
regarded
too
seriously
it
was
not
like
that
in
my
day
then
an
actor
had
to
be
an
artist
there
was
no
position
for
the
little
whippersnapper
who
draws
the
big
money
and
is
ignorant
of
even
the
rudiments
of
the
actor
s
he
allowed
his
glance
to
rest
perceptibly
upon
merton
gill
who
felt
uncomfortable
we
were
with
looey
james
five
years
confided
montague
to
her
neighbours
a
hall
show
of
course
hadn
t
heard
of
movies
then
doing
virginius
and
julius
caesar
and
such
classics
and
then
starting
out
with
the
two
orphans
for
a
short
season
we
were
a
i
ll
say
that
i
ll
never
forget
the
night
we
opened
the
new
opera
house
at
akron
they
had
to
put
the
orchestra
under
the
and
the
art
of
the
moving
picture
robs
us
of
our
little
meed
of
applause
broke
in
her
husband
i
shall
never
forget
a
remark
of
the
late
lawrence
barrett
to
me
after
a
performance
of
richelieu
in
which
he
had
fairly
outdone
himself
montague
my
lad
said
he
we
may
work
for
the
money
but
we
play
for
the
but
now
our
finest
bits
must
go
in
silence
or
perhaps
be
interrupted
by
a
director
who
arrogates
to
himself
the
right
to
instill
into
us
the
rudiments
of
a
profession
in
which
we
had
grounded
ourselves
ere
yet
he
was
out
of
leading
strings
too
often
naturally
the
results
are
the
unabashed
girl
was
meantime
having
sprightly
talk
with
the
casting
director
whom
she
had
hailed
through
the
window
as
countess
merton
somewhat
startled
wondered
if
the
little
woman
could
indeed
be
of
the
nobility
hello
countess
say
listen
can
you
give
the
camera
a
little
peek
at
me
or
at
pa
or
ma
no
nothing
she
had
imitated
the
little
woman
s
voice
in
her
accustomed
reply
well
i
didn
t
think
there
would
be
i
just
thought
i
d
ask
you
ain
t
mad
are
you
i
could
have
gone
on
in
a
harem
tank
scene
over
at
the
bigart
place
but
they
wanted
me
to
dress
the
same
as
a
fish
and
a
young
girl
s
got
to
draw
the
line
somewhere
besides
i
don
t
like
that
hugo
over
there
so
much
he
hates
to
part
with
anything
like
money
and
he
ll
gyp
you
if
he
can
say
i
ll
bet
he
couldn
t
play
an
honest
game
of
solitaire
how
d
you
like
my
hair
this
way
like
it
eh
that
s
good
and
me
having
the
only
freckles
left
in
all
hollywood
ain
t
i
the
little
prairie
flower
growing
wilder
every
hour
say
on
the
level
pa
needs
work
these
days
when
he
s
idle
he
mostly
sticks
home
and
tries
out
new
ways
to
make
prime
old
kentucky
sour
mash
in
eight
hours
if
he
don
t
quit
he
is
going
to
find
himself
seeing
some
moving
pictures
that
no
one
else
can
and
he
s
all
worried
up
about
his
hair
going
off
on
top
and
trying
new
hair
restorers
you
know
his
latest
well
he
goes
over
to
the
selig
place
one
day
and
watches
horse
meat
fed
to
the
lions
and
says
to
himself
that
horses
have
plenty
of
hair
and
it
must
be
the
fat
under
the
skin
that
makes
it
grow
so
he
begs
for
a
hunk
of
horse
from
just
under
the
mane
and
he
s
rubbing
that
on
you
can
t
tell
what
he
ll
bring
home
next
the
old
boy
still
believes
you
can
raise
hair
from
the
dead
do
you
want
some
new
stills
of
me
i
got
a
new
one
yesterday
that
shows
my
other
expression
well
so
long
the
creature
turned
to
her
parents
let
s
be
on
our
way
old
dears
this
place
is
dead
but
the
countess
says
they
ll
soon
be
shooting
some
stuff
up
at
the
consolidated
maybe
there
ll
be
something
in
it
for
someone
we
might
as
well
have
a
merton
felt
relieved
when
the
montague
family
went
out
the
girl
in
the
lead
he
approved
of
the
fine
old
father
but
the
daughter
lacked
dignity
in
speech
and
manner
you
couldn
t
tell
what
she
might
say
next
the
montagues
were
often
there
sometimes
in
full
sometimes
represented
by
but
one
of
their
number
once
montague
was
told
to
be
on
stage
six
the
next
morning
at
to
attend
a
swell
reception
wear
the
gray
georgette
dearie
said
the
casting
director
and
your
big
pearls
and
the
not
forgetting
the
gold
cigarette
case
and
the
chinchilla
neck
piece
said
montague
the
spare
parts
will
all
be
there
countess
and
thanks
for
the
the
elder
montague
on
the
occasion
of
his
calls
often
found
time
to
regale
those
present
with
anecdotes
of
lawrence
barrett
a
fine
artist
in
his
day
sir
none
finer
ever
appeared
in
a
hall
and
always
about
his
once
superb
frock
coat
clung
the
scent
of
forbidden
beverages
on
one
such
day
he
appeared
with
an
untidy
sprouting
of
beard
accompanied
by
the
talkative
daughter
pa
s
landed
a
part
she
explained
through
the
little
window
it
s
one
of
those
mountaineer
plays
with
revenooers
and
feuds

chapter
a
breach
in
the
city
walls
during
these
weeks
of
waiting
outside
the
gate
the
little
woman
beyond
the
window
had
continued
to
be
friendly
but
not
encouraging
to
the
aspirant
for
screen
honours
late
of
simsbury
illinois
for
three
weeks
had
he
waited
faithfully
always
within
call
struggling
and
sacrificing
to
give
the
public
something
better
and
finer
and
not
once
had
he
so
much
as
crossed
the
line
that
led
to
his
goal
then
on
a
monday
morning
he
found
the
empty
and
his
friend
beyond
the
window
suffering
the
pangs
of
headache
it
gets
me
something
fierce
right
through
here
she
confided
to
him
placing
her

her
temples

demanded
in
quick
sympathy
she
looked
at
him
hopefully
never
heard
of
let
me
get
you
you
dear
thing
fly
to
it
he
was
gone
while
she
reached
for
her
purse
hurrying
along
the
street
of
choice
home
sites
to
the
nearest
drug
store
he
was
fearing
someone
else
might
bring
the
little
woman
another
remedy
even
that
her
headache
might
go
before
he
returned
with
his
but
he
found
her
still
suffering
here
they
he
was
breathless

take
a
couple
now
and
a
couple
more
in
half
an
hour
if
the
ache

around
he
was
through
the
door
and
in
the
dimly
lit
little
office
behind
that
secretive
partition
and
here
s
something
else
he
continued
it
s

and

merton

hurried
through
a
narrow
corridor
past
offices
where
typewriters
clicked
and
burst
from
gloom
into
the
dazzling
light
of
the
holden
lot
he
paused
on
the
steps
to
reassure
himself
that
the
great
adventure
was
genuine
there
was
the
full
stretch
of
greensward
of
which
only
an
edge
had
shown
as
he
looked
through
the
gate
there
were
the
vast
structures
of
which
he
had
seen
but
the
ends
and
there
was
the
street
up
which
he
had
looked
for
so
many
weeks
flanked
by
rows
of
offices
and
dressing
rooms
and
lively
with
the
passing
of
many
people
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
became
calculating
he
must
see
everything
and
see
it
methodically
he
even
went
now
along
the
asphalt
walk
to
the
corner
of
the
office
building
from
which
he
had
issued
for
the
privilege
of
looking
back
at
the
gate
through
which
he
had
so
often
yearningly
stared
from
across
the
street
now
he
was
securely
inside
looking
out
the
watchman
sat
at
the
gate
bent
low
over
his
paper
there
was
it
seemed
more
than
one
way
to
get
by
him
people
might
have
headaches
almost
any
time
he
wondered
if
his
friend
the
casting
director
were
subject
to
them
he
must
carry
a
box
of
the
eezo
wafers
he
strolled
down
the
street
between
the
rows
of
offices
and
the
immense
covered
stages
actors
in
costume
entered
two
of
these
and
through
their
open
doors
he
could
see
into
their
shadowy
interiors
he
would
venture
there
later
just
now
he
wished
to
see
the
outside
of
things
he
contrived
a
pace
not
too
swift
but
enough
to
convey
the
impression
that
he
was
rightfully
walking
this
forbidden
street
he
seemed
to
be
going
some
place
where
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
that
he
should
be
and
yet
to
have
started
so
early
that
there
was
no
need
for
haste
he
sounded
the
far
end
of
that
long
street
visible
from
outside
the
gate
discovering
its
excitements
to
wane
gently
into
mere
blacksmith
and
carpenter
shops
he
retraced
his
steps
this
time
ignoring
the
long
row
of
offices
for
the
opposite
line
of
stages
from
one
dark
interior
came
the
slow
dulled
strains
of
an
orchestra
and
from
another
shots
rang
out
he
met
or
passed
strangely
attired
people
bandits
priests
choir
boys
gentlemen
in
evening
dress
with
eyebrows
and
careful
hair
and
he
observed
many
beautiful
young
women
variously
attired
hurrying
to
or
from
the
stages
one
lovely
thing
was
in
bridal
dress
of
dazzling
white
a
veil
of
lace
floating
from
her
blonde
head
her
long
train
held
up
by
a
coloured
maid
she
chatted
amiably
as
she
crossed
the
street
with
an
mexican
in
a
hat
a
veritable
snake
de
vasquez
but
the
stages
could
wait
he
must
see
more
streets
again
reaching
the
office
that
had
been
his
secret
gateway
to
these
delights
he
turned
to
the
right
still
with
the
air
of
having
business
at
a
certain
spot
to
which
there
was
really
no
need
for
him
to
hurry
there
were
fewer
people
this
way
and
presently
as
if
by
magic
carpet
he
had
left
all
that
sunlight
and
glitter
and
cheerful
noise
and
stood
alone
in
the
shadowy
narrow
street
of
a
frontier
town
there
was
no
bustle
here
only
an
intense
stillness
the
street
was
deserted
the
shop
doors
closed
there
was
a
ghostlike
chilling
effect
that
left
him
uneasy
he
called
upon
himself
to
remember
that
he
was
not
actually
in
a
remote
and
desolate
frontier
town
from
which
the
inhabitants
had
fled
that
back
of
him
but
a
few
steps
was
abounding
life
that
outside
was
the
prosaic
world
passing
and
repassing
a
gate
hard
to
enter
he
whistled
the
fragment
of
a
tune
and
went
farther
along
this
street
of
uncanny
silence
and
vacancy
noting
as
he
went
the
signs
on
the
shop
windows
there
was
the
busy
bee
restaurant
jim
s
place
the
hotel
renown
the
last
dollar
dance
hall
hank
s
pool
room
upon
one
window
was
painted
the
terse
announcement
joe
buy
or
the
happy
days
bar
adjoined
the
general
store
he
moved
rapidly
through
this
street
it
was
no
place
to
linger
at
the
lower
end
it
gave
insanely
upon
a
row
of
brownstone
houses
which
any
picture
patron
would
recognize
as
being
wholly
of
new
york
there
were
the
imposing
steps
the
entrances
the
broad
windows
the
massive
lines
of
the
whole
and
beyond
this
he
came
to
a
little
street
out
of
bagdad
overhung
with
gay
balconies
vivacious
with
spindled
towers
and
minarets
and
small
reticent
windows
out
of
which
veiled
ladies
would
glance
and
all
was
still
with
the
stillness
of
utter
desertion
then
he
explored
farther
and
felt
curiously
disappointed
at
finding
that
these
structures
were
to
real
houses
what
a
dicky
is
to
a
sincere
genuine
shirt
they
were
pretentiously
false
one
had
but
to
step
behind
them
to
discover
them
as
poor
shells
their
backs
were
jutting
beams
carried
but
little
beyond
the
fronts
and
their
walls
were
revealed
to
be
fragile
contrivances
of
and
thin
plaster
the
ghost
quality
departed
from
them
with
this
discovery
he
left
these
cities
of
silence
and
came
upon
an
open
space
and
people
they
were
grouped
before
a
railway
station
a
small
red
structure
beside
a
line
of
railway
track
at
one
end
in
black
letters
on
a
narrow
white
board
was
the
name
boomerville
the
people
were
plainly
western
a
dozen
cowboys
a
sprinkling
of
bluff
ranchers
and
their
families
an
absorbed
young
man
in
cap
and
khaki
and
puttees
came
from
a
distant
group
surrounding
a
camera
and
readjusted
the
line
of
these
people
he
placed
them
to
his
liking
a
wagon
drawn
by
two
horses
was
driven
up
and
a
rancher
helped
a
woman
and
girl
to
alight
the
girl
was
at
once
sought
out
by
the
cowboys
they
shook
hands
warmly
under
megaphoned
directions
from
a
man
back
by
the
camera
the
rancher
and
his
wife
mingled
with
the
group
the
girl
was
drawn
aside
by
one
of
the
cowboys
he
had
a
nobler
presence
than
the
others
he
was
handsome
and
his
accoutrements
seemed
more
expensive
they
looked
into
each
other
s
eyes
a
long
time
apparently
pledging
an
eternal
fidelity
one
gathered
that
there
would
have
been
an
embrace
but
for
the
cowboy
s
watchful
companions
they
must
say
with
a
mere
handshake
though
this
was
a
slow
trembling
clasp
while
they
steadily
regarded
each
other
and
a
second
camera
was
brought
to
record
it
at
a
distance
of
six
feet
merton
gill
thrilled
with
the
knowledge
that
he
was
beholding
his
first
his
long
study
of
the
enabled
him
to
divine
that
the
rancher
s
daughter
was
going
to
vassar
college
to
be
educated
but
that
although
returning
a
year
later
a
poised
woman
of
the
world
she
would
still
long
for
the
handsome
cowboy
who
would
marry
her
and
run
the
ranch
the
scene
was
done
the
camera
would
next
be
turned
upon
a
real
train
at
some
real
station
while
the
girl
with
a
final
look
at
her
lover
entered
a
real
car
which
the
camera
would
show
moving
off
to
vassar
college
thus
conveying
to
millions
of
delighted
spectators
the
impression
that
a
real
train
had
steamed
out
of
the
station
which
was
merely
an
imitation
of
one
on
the
holden
lot
the
watcher
passed
on
he
could
hear
the
cheerful
drone
of
a
sawmill
where
logs
were
being
cut
he
followed
the
sound
and
came
to
its
source
the
saw
was
at
the
end
of
an
oblong
pool
in
which
logs
floated
workmen
were
poling
these
toward
the
saw
on
a
raised
platform
at
one
side
was
a
camera
and
a
man
who
gave
directions
through
a
megaphone
a
neighbouring
platform
held
a
second
camera
a
beautiful
young
girl
in
a
print
dress
and
her
thick
hair
in
a
braid
came
bringing
his
dinner
in
a
tin
pail
to
the
handsomest
of
the
actors
he
laid
down
his
and
took
both
the
girl
s
hands
in
his
as
he
received
the
pail
one
of
the
other
workmen
a
hulking
brute
with
an
evil
face
scowled
darkly
at
this
encounter
and
a
moment
later
had
insulted
the
beautiful
young
girl
but
the
first
actor
felled
him
with
a
blow
he
came
up
from
this
crouchingly
and
the
fight
was
on
merton
was
excited
by
this
fight
even
though
he
was
in
no
doubt
as
to
which
actor
would
win
it
they
fought
hard
and
for
a
time
it
appeared
that
the
handsome
actor
must
lose
for
the
bully
who
had
insulted
the
girl
was
a
man
of
great
strength
but
the
science
of
the
other
told
it
was
the
first
fight
merton
had
ever
witnessed
he
thought
these
men
must
really
be
hating
each
other
so
bitter
were
their
expressions
the
battle
grew
fiercer
it
was
splendid
then
at
the
shrill
note
of
a
whistle
the
panting
combatants
fell
apart
rotten
said
an
annoyed
voice
through
the
megaphone
can
t
you
boys
give
me
a
little
action

jazz

think
it
s
a
love
scene

of
jazz

what
i

turned
to
the
camera
man
beside
him
ed

machine

ll
get
you
all
right
ready
now
camera
again
the
fight
was
on
it
went
to
a
bitter
finish
in
which
the
vanquished
bully
was
sent
with
a
powerful
blow
backward
into
the
water
while
the
beautiful
young
girl
ran
to
the
victor
and
nestled
in
the
protection
of
his
strong
arms
merton
gill
passed
on
this
was
the
real
thing
he
would
have
a
lot
to
tell
tessie
kearns
in
his
next
letter
beyond
the
sawmill
he
came
to
an
immense
wooden
structure
like
a
cradle
on
huge
rockers
supported
by
scaffolding
from
the
ground
he
could
make
nothing
of
it
but
a
ladder
led
to
the
top
an
hour
on
the
holden
lot
had
made
him
bold
he
mounted
the
ladder
and
stood
on
the
deck
of
what
he
saw
was
a
yacht
three
men
were
surveying
the
deckhouse
forward
they
glanced
at
the
newcomer
but
with
a
cheering
absence
of
curiosity
or
even
of
interest
he
sauntered
past
them
with
a
polite
but
interest
the
yacht
would
be
an
expensive
one
the
deck
fittings
were
elaborate
a
glance
into
the
captain
s
cabin
revealed
it
to
be
fully
furnished
with
a
chart
and
a
sextant
on
the
mahogany
desk
where
s
the
bedding
for
this
stateroom
asked
one
of
the
men
i
got
a
after
it
one
of
the
others
informed
him
they
strolled
aft
and
paused
by
an
iron
standard
ingeniously
swung
from
the
deck
that
s
burke
s
idea
said
one
of
the
men
i
hadn
t
thought
about
a
steady
support
for
the
camera
of
course
if
we
stood
it
on
deck
it
would
rock
when
the
ship
rocked
and
we
d
get
no
motion
so
burke
figures
this
out
the
camera
is
on
here
and
swings
by
that
weight
so
it
s
always
straight
and
the
rocking
registers
pretty
neat
what
that
was
nothing
to
think
of
said
one
of
the
other
men
in
apparent
disparagement
i
thought
of
it
myself
the
minute
i
saw
the
other
two
grinned
at
this
though
merton
gill
standing
by
saw
nothing
to
laugh
at
he
thought
the
speaker
was
pretty
cheeky
for
of
course
any
one
could
think
of
this
device
after
seeing
it
he
paused
for
a
final
survey
of
his
surroundings
from
this
elevation
he
could
see
the
real
falseness
of
the
sawmill
he
had
just
left
he
could
also
look
into
the
exposed
rear
of
the
railway
station
and
could
observe
beyond
it
the
exposed
skeleton
of
that
new
york
street
he
was
surrounded
by
mockeries
he
clambered
down
the
ladder
and
sauntered
back
to
the
street
of
offices
he
was
by
this
time
confident
that
no
one
was
going
to
ask
him
what
right
he
had
in
there
now
too
he
became
conscious
of
hunger
and
at
the
same
moment
caught
the
sign
cafeteria
over
a
neat
building
hitherto
unnoticed
people
were
entering
this
many
of
them
in
costume
he
went
idly
toward
the
door
glanced
up
looked
at
his
watch
and
became
to
any
one
curious
about
him
a
man
who
had
that
moment
decided
he
might
as
well
have
a
little
food
he
opened
the
screen
door
of
the
cafeteria
half
expecting
it
to
prove
one
of
those
structures
equipped
only
with
a
front
but
the
cafeteria
was
practicable
the
floor
was
crowded
with
little
square
polished
tables
at
which
many
people
were
eating
a
railing
along
the
side
of
the
room
made
a
passage
to
the
back
where
food
was
served
from
a
counter
to
the
proffered
tray
he
fell
into
line
no
one
had
asked
him
how
he
dared
try
to
eat
with
real
actors
and
actresses
and
apparently
no
one
was
going
to
toward
the
end
of
the
passage
was
a
table
holding
trays
and
napkins
the
latter
wrapped
about
an
equipment
of
cutlery
he
took
his
tray
and
received
at
the
counter
the
foods
he
designated
he
went
through
this
ordeal
with
difficulty
because
it
was
not
easy
to
keep
from
staring
about
at
other
patrons
constantly
he
was
detecting
some
remembered
face
but
at
last
with
his
laden
tray
he
reached
a
vacant
table
near
the
centre
of
the
room
and
took
his
seat
he
absently
arranged
the
food
before
him
he
could
stare
at
leisure
now
all
about
him
were
the
strongly
marked
faces
of
the
film
people
heavy
with
makeup
interspersed
with
hungry
civilians
who
might
be
producers
directors
camera
men
or
mere
artisans
for
the
democracy
of
the
cafeteria
seemed
ideal
at
the
table
ahead
of
his
he
recognized
the
man
who
had
been
annoyed
one
day
by
the
silly
question
of
the
montague
girl
they
had
said
he
was
a
very
important
director
he
still
looked
important
and
intensely
serious
he
was
a
short
very
plump
man
with
pale
cheeks
under
dark
brows
and
troubled
looking
gray
hair
he
was
very
seriously
explaining
something
to
the
man
who
sat
with
him
and
whom
he
addressed
as
governor
a
person
with
a
stubby
gray
mustache
and
little
hair
who
seemed
not
too
attentive
to
the
director
you
see
governor
it
s
this
way
the
party
is
lost
on
the
desert
understand
what
i
mean
and
kempton
ward
and
the
girl
stumble
into
this
deserted
tomb
just
at
nightfall
now
here
s
where
the
big
kick
comes
merton
gill
ceased
to
listen
for
there
now
halted
at
his
table
bearing
a
laden
tray
none
other
than
the
montague
girl
she
of
the
slangy
talk
and
the
regrettably
free
manner
she
put
down
her
tray
and
seated
herself
before
it
she
had
not
asked
permission
of
the
table
s
other
occupant
indeed
she
had
not
even
glanced
at
him
for
cafeteria
etiquette
is
not
rigorous
he
saw
that
she
was
heavily
made
up
and
in
the
costume
of
a
gypsy
he
thought
a
short
vivid
skirt
a
gay
waist
heavy
gold
hoops
in
her
ears
and
dark
hair
massed
about
her
small
head
he
remembered
that
this
would
not
be
her
own
hair
she
fell
at
once
to
her
food
the
men
at
the
next
table
glanced
at
her
the
director
without
cordiality
but
the
other
man
smiled
upon
her
cheerfully
hello

putterin

his
new

drop
over
sometime
flips
i
m
keeping
you

thanks
governor
say
merton
glanced
up
in
time
to
see
her
wink
broadly
at
the
man
and
look
toward
his
companion
who
still
seriously
made
notes
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
the
man
s
face
melted
to
a
grin
which
he
quickly
erased
the
girl
began
again
mr
henshaw
could
you
give
me
just
a
moment
henshaw
the
serious
director
looked
up
in
quite
frank
annoyance
yes
yes
what
is
it
miss
montague
well
listen
henshaw
i
got
a
great
idea
for
a
story
and
i
was
thinking
who
to
take
it
to
and
i
thought
of
this
one
and
i
thought
of
that
one
and
i
asked
my
friends
and
they
all
say
take
it
to
henshaw
because
if
a
story
has
any
merit
he
s
the
one
director
on
the
lot
that
can
detect
it
and
get
every
bit
of
value
out
of
it
so
i
thought
but
of
course
if
you
re
busy
just
now
the
director
thawed
ever
so
slightly
of
course
my
girl
i
m
busy
but
then
i
m
always
busy
they
run
me
to
death
here
still
it
was
very
kind
of
your
friends
and
of
course
thank
you
she
clasped
her
hands
to
her
breast
and
gazed
raptly
into
the
face
of
her
coy
listener
of
course
i
ll
have
to
have
help
on
the
details
but
it
starts
off
kind
of
like
this
you
see
i
m
a
hawaiian
princess
she
paused
gazing
aloft
yes
yes
miss
montague
an
hawaiian
princess
go
on
go
on
oh
excuse
me
i
was
thinking
how
i
d
dress
her
for
the
last
spool
in
the
big
fire
scene
well
anyway
i
m
this
hawaiian
princess
and
my
father
old
king
mauna
loa
dies
and
leaves
me
thousand
volcanoes
and
a
billiard
cue
henshaw
blinked
rapidly
at
this
for
a
moment
he
was
dazed
a
billiard
cue
did
you
say
he
demanded
blankly
yes
and
every
morning
i
have
to
go
out
and
ram
it
down
the
volcanoes
to
see
are
they
all
right
and
tush
tush
interrupted
henshaw
scowling
upon
the
playwright
and
fell
again
to
his
envelope
pretending
thereafter
to
ignore
her
the
girl
seemed
to
be
unaware
that
she
had
lost
his
attention
and
you
see
the
villain
is
very
wealthy
he
owns
the
largest
ukelele
factory
in
the
islands
and
he
tries
to
get
me
in
his
power
but
he
s
foiled
by
my
fiance
a
young
native
by
the
name
of
herman
schwarz
who
has
invented
a
folding
ukelele
so
the
villain
gets
his
hired
hawaiian
orchestra
to
shove
herman
down
one
of
the
volcanoes
and
me
down
another
but
i
have
the
key
around
my
neck
which
father
put
there
when
i
was
a
babe
and
made
me
swear
always
to
wear
it
even
in
the
so
i
let
myself
out
and
unlock
the
other
one
and
let
herman
out
and
the
orchestra
discovers
us
and
chases
us
over
the
cliff
and
then
along
comes
my
old
nurse
who
is
now
running
a
cigar
store
in
san
pedro
and
she
here
she
affected
to
discover
that
henshaw
no
longer
listened
why
henshaw
s
gone
she
exclaimed
dramatically
boy
boy
page
henshaw
remained
oblivious
oh
well
of
course
i
might
have
expected
you
wouldn
t
have
time
to
listen
to
my
poor
little
plot
of
course
i
know
it
s
crude
but
it
did
seem
to
me
that
something
might
be
made
out
of
she
resumed
her
food
henshaw
s
companion
here
winked
at
her
and
was
seen
to
be
shaking
with
emotion
merton
gill
could
not
believe
it
to
be
laughter
for
he
had
seen
nothing
to
laugh
at
a
busy
man
had
been
bothered
by
a
silly
girl
who
thought
she
had
the
plot
for
a
photodrama
and
even
he
merton
gill
could
have
told
her
that
her
plot
was
impossibly
wild
and
inconsequent
if
she
were
going
into
that
branch
of
the
art
she
ought
to
take
lessons
the
way
tessie
kearns
did
she
now
looked
so
mournful
that
he
was
almost
moved
to
tell
her
this
but
her
eyes
caught
his
at
that
moment
and
in
them
was
a
light
so
curious
so
alive
with
hidden
meanings
so
eloquent
of
some
iron
restraint
she
put
upon
her
own
emotions
that
he
became
confused
and
turned
his
gaze
from
hers
almost
with
the
rebuking
glare
of
henshaw
she
glanced
quickly
at
him
again
studying
his
face
for
the
first
time
there
had
been
such
a
queer
look
in
this
young
man
s
eyes
she
understood
most
looks
but
not
that
one
henshaw
was
treating
the
late
interruption
as
if
it
had
not
been
you
see
governor
the
way
we
got
the
script
now
they
re
in
this
tomb
alone
for
the
night
understand
what
i
mean
and
that
s
where
the
kick
comes
for
the
audience
they
know
he
s
a
strong
young
fellow
and
she
s
a
beautiful
girl
and
absolutely
in
his
power
see
what
i
mean
but
he
s
a
gentleman
through
and
through
and
never
lays
a
hand
on
her
get
that
then
later
along
comes
this
ben
ali
ahab
the
montague
girl
glanced
again
at
the
face
of
the
strange
young
man
whose
eyes
had
held
a
new
expression
for
her
but
she
and
henshaw
and
the
governor
and
all
those
other
diners
who
rattled
thick
crockery
and
talked
unendingly
had
ceased
to
exist
for
merton
gill
a
dozen
tables
down
the
room
and
nearer
the
door
sat
none
other
than
beulah
baxter
alone
at
her
table
she
gazed
raptly
aloft
meditating
perhaps
some
daring
new
feat
merton
gill
stared
entranced
frozen
the
montague
girl
perfectly
understood
this
look
and
traced
it
to
its
object
then
she
surveyed
merton
gill
again
with
something
faintly
like
pity
in
her
shrewd
eyes
he
was
still
staring
still
rapt
beulah
baxter
ceased
to
look
aloft
she
daintily
reached
for
a
wooden
toothpick
from
the
bowl
before
her
and
arose
to
pay
her
check
at
the
counter
merton
gill
arose
at
the
same
moment
and
stumbled
a
blind
way
through
the
intervening
tables
when
he
reached
the
counter
miss
baxter
was
passing
through
the
door
he
was
about
to
follow
her
when
a
cool
but
cynical
voice
from
the
counter
said
hey
bill
ain
t
you
fergittin
somepin
he
looked
for
the
check
for
his
meal
it
should
have
been
in
one
hand
or
the
other
but
it
was
in
neither
he
must
have
left
it
back
on
his
tray
now
he
must
return
for
it
he
went
as
quickly
as
he
could
the
montague
girl
was
holding
it
up
as
he
approached
here
s
the
little
joker
kid
she
said
kindly
thanks
said
merton
he
said
it
haughtily
not
meaning
to
be
haughty
but
he
was
embarrassed
and
also
fearful
that
beulah
baxter
would
be
lost
exit
limping
murmured
the
girl
as
he
turned
away
he
hurried
again
to
the
door
paid
the
check
and
was
outside
miss
baxter
was
not
to
be
seen
his
forgetfulness
about
the
check
had
lost
her
to
him
he
had
meant
to
follow
to
find
the
place
where
she
was
working
and
look
and
look
and
look
now
he
had
lost
her
but
she
might
be
on
one
of
those
stages
within
the
big
barns
perhaps
the
day
was
not
yet
lost
he
crossed
the
street
forgetting
to
saunter
and
ventured
within
the
cavernous
gloom
beyond
an
open
door
he
stood
for
a
moment
his
vision
dulled
by
the
dusk
presently
he
saw
that
he
faced
a
wall
of
canvas
backing
beyond
this
were
low
voices
and
the
sound
of
people
moving
he
went
forward
to
a
break
in
the
canvas
wall
and
at
the
same
moment
there
was
a
metallic
jar
and
light
flooded
the
enclosure
from
somewhere
outside
came
music
principally
the
low
leisurely
moan
of
a
cello
a
beautiful
woman
in
evening
dress
was
with
suppressed
emotion
kneeling
at
the
bedside
of
a
sleeping
child
at
the
doorway
stood
a
dark
handsome
gentleman
in
evening
dress
regarding
her
with
a
cynical
smile
the
woman
seemed
to
bid
the
child
farewell
and
arose
with
hands
to
her
breast
and
quivering
lips
the
gentleman
awaited
her
when
she
came
to
him
glancing
backward
to
the
sleeping
child
he
threw
about
her
an
elaborate
fur
cloak
and
drew
her
to
him
his
cynical
smile
changing
to
one
of
deceitful
tenderness
the
woman
still
glanced
back
at
the
child
but
permitted
herself
to
be
drawn
through
the
doorway
by
the
insistent
gentleman
from
a
door
the
other
side
of
the
bed
came
a
nurse
she
looked
first
at
the
little
one
then
advanced
to
stare
after
the
departing
couple
she
raised
her
hands
tragically
and
her
face
became
set
in
a
mask
of
sorrow
and
despair
she
clasped
the
hands
desperately
merton
gill
saw
his
nurse
to
be
the
montague
mother
all
right
said
an
authoritative
voice
montague
relaxed
her
features
and
withdrew
while
an
unkempt
youth
came
to
stand
in
front
of
the
camera
and
held
before
it
a
placard
on
which
were
numbers
the
camera
stopped
the
youth
with
the
placard
vanished
save
it
called
another
voice
and
with
another
metallic
jar
the
flood
of
light
was
turned
off
the
cello
ceased
its
moan
in
the
middle
of
a
bar
the
watcher
recalled
some
of
the
girl
s
chat
her
mother
had
a
character
bit
in
her
other
husband
this
would
be
it
one
of
those
moving
tragedies
not
unfamiliar
to
the
screen
enthusiast
the
beautiful
but
misguided
wife
had
been
saying
to
her
little
one
and
was
leaving
her
beautiful
home
at
the
solicitation
of
the
false
friend
in
evening
dress
forgetting
all
in
one
mad
moment
the
watcher
was
a
tried
expert
and
like
the
trained
faunal
naturalist
could
determine
a
species
from
the
shrewd
examination
of
one
bone
of
a
photoplay
he
knew
that
the
wife
had
been
ignored
by
a
husband
who
permitted
his
vast
business
interests
to
engross
his
whole
attention
leaving
the
wife
to
seek
solace
in
questionable
quarters
he
knew
that
the
shocked
but
faithful
nurse
would
presently
discover
the
little
one
to
be
suffering
from
a
dangerous
fever
that
a
hastily
summoned
physician
would
shake
his
head
and
declare
in
legible
words
naught
but
a
mother
s
love
can
win
that
tiny
soul
back
from
the
brink
of
the
father
would
overhear
this
and
would
see
it
all
then
how
his
selfish
absorption
in
wall
street
had
driven
his
wife
to
another
he
would
pursue
her
would
find
her
ere
yet
it
was
too
late
he
would
discover
that
her
better
nature
had
already
prevailed
and
that
she
had
started
back
without
being
sent
for
they
would
kneel
side
by
side
hand
in
hand
at
the
bedside
of
the
little
one
who
would
recover
and
smile
and
prattle
and
together
they
would
face
an
untroubled
future
this
was
all
thrilling
to
merton
gill
but
beulah
baxter
was
not
here
her
plays
being
clean
and
wholesome
things
of
the
great
outdoors
far
down
the
great
enclosure
was
another
wall
of
canvas
backing
a
flood
of
light
above
it
and
animated
voices
from
within
he
stood
again
to
watch
but
this
drama
seemed
to
have
been
suspended
the
room
exposed
was
a
bedroom
with
an
open
window
facing
an
open
door
the
actors
and
the
mechanical
staff
as
well
were
busily
hurling
knives
at
various
walls
they
were
earnest
and
absorbed
in
this
curious
pursuit
sometimes
they
made
the
knife
penetrate
the
wall
oftener
it
merely
struck
and
clattered
to
the
floor
five
knives
at
once
were
being
hurled
by
five
enthusiasts
while
a
director
watched
and
criticised
you
re
a
clumsy
bunch
he
announced
at
last
it
s
a
simple
thing
to
do
isn
t
it
the
redoubled
their
efforts
but
they
did
not
find
it
a
simple
thing
to
do
let
me
try
it
it
was
the
montague
girl
still
in
her
gipsy
costume
she
had
been
standing
quietly
in
the
shadow
observing
the
ineffective
practice
hello
flips
sure
you
can
try
it
show
these
boys
something
good
now
here
al
give
miss
montague
that
stickeree
of
al
seemed
glad
to
relinquish
the
weapon
miss
montague
hefted
it
and
looked
doubtful
it
ain
t
balanced
right
she
declared
haven
t
you
got
one
with
a
heavier
handle
fair
enough
said
the
director
hey
pickles
let
her
try
that
one
you

quivering
there

four

destiny
putting
a
little
pep
into
the
mob
stuff
laid
out
for
two
hours
waiting
for
something
i
don
t
know
merton
gill
passed
on
he
confessed
now
to
a
reluctant
admiration
for
the
montague
girl
she
could
surely
throw
a
knife
he
must
practise
that
himself
sometime
he
might
have
stayed
to
see
more
of
this
drama
but
he
was
afraid
the
girl
would
break
out
into
more
of
her
nonsense
he
was
aware
that
she
swept
him
with
her
eyes
as
he
turned
away
but
he
evaded
her
glance
she
was
not
a
person
he
thought
that
one
ought
to
encourage
he
emerged
from
the
great
building
and
crossed
an
alley
to
another
of
like
size
down
toward
its
middle
was
the
usual
wall
of
canvas
with
men
about
the
opening
at
one
corner
a
curious
whirring
noise
came
from
within
he
became
an
inconspicuous
unit
of
the
group
and
gazed
in
the
lights
were
on
revealing
a
long
table
elaborately
set
as
for
a
banquet
but
the
guests
who
stood
about
gave
him
instant
uneasiness
they
were
in
the
grossest
caricatures
of
evening
dress
both
men
and
women
and
they
were
not
beautiful
the
gowns
of
the
women
were
grotesque
and
the
men
were
lawless
appearing
either
as
to
hair
or
beards
or
both
he
divined
the
dreadful
thing
he
was
stumbling
upon
even
before
he
noted
the
sign
in
large
letters
on
the
back
of
a
folding
chair
jeff
baird
s
buckeye
these
were
the
buffoons
who
with
their
coarse
pantomime
their
heavy
did
so
much
to
debase
a
great
art
there
even
at
his
side
was
the
arch
offender
none
other
than
jeff
baird
himself
the
man
whose
regrettable
sense
of
humour
led
him
to
make
these
low
appeals
to
the
witless
and
even
as
he
looked
the
man
entered
the
scene
garbed
in
the
weirdly
misfitting
clothes
of
a
waiter
holding
aloft
a
loaded
tray
of
dishes
he
entered
on
roller
skates
to
halt
before
baird
with
his
uplifted
tray
at
a
precarious
balance
all
right
that
s
better
said
baird
and
gertie
listen
don
t
throw
the
chair
in
front
of
him
that
s
out
now
we
ll
have
the
entrance
again
you
other
boys
on
the
rollers
there
three
other
basely
comic
waiters
on
roller
skates
came
to
attention
follow
him
in
and
pile
up
on
him
when
he
makes
the
grand
spill
see
what
i
mean
get
your
trays
loaded
now
and
get
off
now
you
other
people
take
your
seats
no
no
annie
you
re
at
the
head
i
told
you
tom
you
re
at
the
foot
and
start
the
when
you
get
the
tray
in
the
neck
now
all
merton
gill
was
about
to
leave
this
distressing
scene
but
was
held
in
spite
of
himself
by
the
voice
of
a
newcomer
hello
jeff
atta
boy
he
knew
without
turning
that
the
montague
girl
was
again
at
his
elbow
he
wondered
if
she
could
be
following
him
hello
flips
how
s
the
kid
the
producer
had
turned
cordially
to
her
just
in
time
for
the
breakaway
stuff
see
how
you
like
what
s
the
big
idea
swell
reception
at
the
maison

waiters
on
roller
skates
in
honour
of
rich
uncle

the
head
waiter
starts
the
fight
by
doing
a
fall
with
his
tray
tom
gets
the
tray
in
the
neck
and
soaks
the
nearest
man
banquet

then

the
chase

is
uncle
rollo
that
s
him
at
the
table
with
the
herbaceous
border
under
his
is
he
in
the
fight
i
think
so
i
was
going
to
rehearse
it
once
more
to
see
if
i
could
get
a
better
idea
near
as
i
can
see
now
everybody
takes
a
crack
at
well
montague
girl
seemed
to
be
considering
say
how
about
this
jeff
he
s
awful
hungry
see
and
he
s
begun
to
eat
the
celery
and
everything
he
can
reach
and
when
the
starts
he
just
eats
on
and
pays
no
attention
to
it
never
even
looks
up
see
what
i
mean
the
fight
spreads
the
whole
length
of
the
table
right
around
rollo
murders
are
going
on
and
he
just
eats
and
pays
no
attention
and
he
s
still
eating
when
they
re
all
down
and
out
and
don
t
know
a
thing
till
charlie
or
someone
crowns
him
with
the
how
about
it
ain
t
there
a
laugh
in
that
baird
had
listened
respectfully
and
now
patted
the
girl
on
a
shoulder
good
work
kid
that
s
a
gag
all
right
the
little
bean
s
sparking

around
again
we
need
folks
like
you
now
listen
rollo
you
there
rollo
come
here
and
get
this
now
listen
when
the
fight
begins
merton
gill
turned
decisively
away
such
coarse
foolery
as
this
was
too
remote
from
beulah
baxter
who
somewhere
on
that
lot
was
doing
something
really
as
her
interview
had
put
it
distinctive
and
worth
while
he
lingered
only
to
hear
the
last
of
baird
s
instructions
to
rollo
and
the
absurd
guests
finding
some
sinister
fascination
in
the
man
s
talk
baird
then
turned
to
the
girl
who
had
also
started
off
hang
around
flips
why
the
rush
got
to
beat
it
over
to
number
got
anything
good
there
nothing
that
will
get
me
any
billing
been
waiting
two
hours
now
just
to
look
frenzied
in
a
well
say
come
around
and
see
me
some
all
right
jeff
of
course
i

two
reeler
to
pull

then
i
m
goin
to

a
big
idea
probably
something
for
you
in
it
drop
in
t
the
office
and
talk
it
over
come
in
some
time
next
week
f
i
ain
t
there
i
ll
be
on
the
lot
some
place
don
t
forget
merton
gill
some
distance
from
the
buckeye
set
waited
to
note
what
direction
the
montague
girl
would
take
she
broke
away
presently
glanced
brazenly
in
his
direction
and
tripped
lightly
out
the
nearest
exit
he
went
swiftly
to
one
at
the
far
end
of
the
building
and
was
again
in
the
exciting
street
but
the
afternoon
was
drawing
in
and
the
street
had
lost
much
of
its
vivacity
it
would
surely
be
too
late
for
any
glimpse
of
his
heroine
and
his
mind
was
already
cluttered
with
impressions
from
his
day
s
adventure
he
went
out
through
the
office
meaning
to
thank
the
casting
director
for
the
great
favour
she
had
shown
him
but
she
was
gone
he
hoped
the
headache
had
not
driven
her
home
if
she
were
to
suffer
again
he
hoped
it
would
be
some
morning
he
would
have
the
eezo
wafers
in
one
pocket
and
a
menthol
pencil
in
the
other
and
she
would
again
extend
to
him
the
freedom
of
that
wonderful
city
in
his
room
that
night
he
tried
to
smooth
out
the
jumble
in
his
dazed
mind
those
people
seemed
to
say
so
many
things
they
considered
funny
but
that
were
not
really
funny
to
any
one
else
and
plays
were
always
waiting
for
something
with
the
bored
actors
lounging
about
in
idle
apathy
still
in
his
ears
sounded
the
drone
of
the
sawmill
and
the
deep
purr
of
the
lights
when
they
were
put
on
that
was
a
funny
thing
when
they
wanted
the
lights
on
they
said
kick
it
and
when
they
wanted
the
lights
off
they
said
save
it
and
why
did
a
boy
come
out
after
every
scene
and
hold
up
a
placard
with
numbers
on
it
before
the
camera
that
placard
had
never
shown
in
any
picture
he
had
seen
and
that
queer
montague
girl
always
turning
up
when
you
thought
you
had
got
rid
of
her
still
she
had
thrown
that
knife
pretty
well
you
had
to
give
her
credit
for
that
but
she
couldn
t
be
much
of
an
actress
even
if
she
had
spoken
of
acting
with
miss
baxter
of
climbing
down
cables
with
her
and
falling
off
cliffs
probably
she
was
boasting
because
he
had
never
seen
any
one
but
miss
baxter
do
these
things
in
her
pictures
probably
she
had
some
very
minor
part
anyway
it
was
certain
she
couldn
t
be
much
of
an
actress
because
she
had
almost
promised
to
act
in
those
terrible
buckeye
comedies
and
of
course
no
one
with
any
real
ambition
or
capacity
could
consider
such
a
thing
descending
to
rough
for
the
amusement
of
the
coarser
element
among
screen
patrons
but
there
was
one
impression
from
the
day
s
whirl
that
remained
clear
and
radiant
he
had
looked
at
the
veritable
face
of
his
heroine
he
began
his
letter
to
tessie
kearns
at
last
i
have
seen
miss
baxter
face
to
face
there
was
no
doubt
about
its
being
her
you
would
have
known
her
at
once
and
how
beautiful
she
is
she
was
looking
up
and
seemed
inspired
probably
thinking
about
her
part
she
reminded
me
of
that
beautiful
picture
of
cecelia
playing
on
the
piano
chapter
vi
under
the
glass
tops
he
approached
the
office
of
the
holden
studios
the
following
morning
with
a
new
air
of
assurance
formerly
the
mere
approach
had
been
an
adventure
the
look
through
the
gate
the
quick
glimpse
of
the
privileged
ones
who
entered
the
mingling
later
with
the
hopeful
and
the
ones
who
waited
but
now
his
feeling
was
that
he
had
somehow
become
a
part
of
that
higher
life
beyond
the
gate
he
might
linger
outside
at
odd
moments
but
rightfully
he
belonged
inside
his
novitiate
had
passed
he
was
one
of
those
who
threw
knives
or
battled
at
the
sawmill
with
the
persecuter
of
innocence
or
lured
beautiful
women
from
their
homes
he
might
be
taken
he
thought
for
an
actor
resting
between
pictures
at
the
gate
he
suffered
a
momentary
regret
at
an
error
of
tactics
committed
the
evening
before
instead
of
leaving
the
lot
by
the
office
he
should
have
left
by
the
gate
he
should
have
strolled
to
this
exit
in
a
leisurely
manner
and
stopped
just
inside
the
barrier
for
a
chat
with
the
watchman
a
chat
beginning
with
the
gift
of
a
cigar
which
should
have
impressed
his
appearance
upon
that
person
he
should
have
remarked
casually
that
he
had
had
a
hard
day
on
stage
number
four
and
must
now
be
off
to
a
good
night
s
rest
because
of
the
equally
hard
day
thus
he
could
now
have
approached
the
gate
with
confidence
and
passed
freely
in
with
a
few
more
pleasant
words
to
the
watchman
who
would
have
no
difficulty
in
recalling
him
but
it
was
vain
to
wish
this
for
all
the
watchman
knew
this
young
man
had
never
been
beyond
the
walls
of
the
forbidden
city
nor
would
he
know
any
reason
why
the
besieger
should
not
forever
be
kept
outside
he
would
fix
that
next
time
he
approached
the
window
of
the
casting
office
with
mingled
emotions
he
did
not
hope
to
find
his
friend
again
stricken
with
headache
but
if
it
chanced
that
she
did
suffer
he
hoped
to
be
the
first
to
learn
of
it
was
he
not
fortified
with
the
potent
eezo
wafers
and
a
new
menthol
pencil
even
with
an
additional
remedy
of
tablets
that
the
druggist
had
strongly
recommended
it
was
therefore
not
with
any
actual
crude
disappointment
that
he
learned
of
his
friend
s
perfect
she
smiled
pleasantly
at
him
the
telephone
receiver
at
one
ear
nothing
dear
she
said
and
put
down
the
instrument
yes
the
headache
was
gone
vanquished
by
his
remedies
she
was
fine
thank
you
no
the
headaches
didn
t
come
often
it
might
be
weeks
before
she
had
another
attack
no
of
course
she
couldn
t
be
certain
of
this
and
indeed
she
would
be
sure
to
let
him
know
at
the
very
first
sign
of
their
recurrence
he
looked
over
his
patient
with
real
anxiety
a
solicitude
from
the
bottom
of
which
he
was
somehow
unable
to
expel
the
last
trace
of
a
lingering
hope
that
would
have
dismayed
the
little
woman
not
hope
exactly
but
something
almost
like
it
which
he
would
only
translate
to
himself
as
an
earnest
desire
that
he
might
be
at
hand
when
the
dread
indisposition
did
attack
her
just
now
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
she
was
free
from
pain
he
thanked
her
profusely
for
her
courtesy
of
the
day
before
he
had
seen
wonderful
things
he
had
learned
a
lot
and
he
wanted
to
ask
her
something
assuring
himself
that
he
was
alone
in
the
waiting
room
it
was
this
did
she
happen
to
know
was
miss
beulah
baxter
married
the
little
woman
sighed
in
a
tired
manner
baxter
married
let
me
she
tapped
her
teeth
with
the
end
of
a
pencil
frowning
into
her
vast
knowledge
of
the
people
beyond
the
gate
now
let
me
but
this
appeared
to
be
without
result
oh
i
really
don
t
know
i
forget
i
suppose
so
why
not
she
often
he
would
have
asked
more
questions
but
the
telephone
rang
and
she
listened
a
long
time
contributing
a
yes
yes
of
understanding
at
brief
intervals
this
talk
ended
she
briskly
demanded
a
number
and
began
to
talk
in
her
turn
merton
gill
saw
that
for
the
time
he
had
passed
from
her
life
she
was
calling
an
agency
she
wanted
people
for
a
diplomatic
reception
in
washington
she
must
have
a
bulgarian
general
a
serbian
diplomat
two
french
colonels
and
a
belgian
captain
all
in
uniform
and
all
good
types
she
didn
t
want
just
anybody
but
types
that
would
stand
out
holden
studios
on
stage
number
two
before
noon
if
possible
all
right
then
another
bell
rang
almost
before
she
had
hung
up
hello
grace
nothing
dear
they
re
out
on
location
down
toward
venice
getting
some
desert
stuff
yes
i
ll
let
you
merton
gill
had
now
to
make
way
at
the
window
for
a
youngish
woman
who
had
once
been
prettier
who
led
an
elaborately
dressed
little
girl
of
five
she
lifted
the
child
to
the
window
say
to
the
beautiful
lady
toots
countess
i
m
sure
you
got
something
for
toots
and
me
because
it
s
our
birthday
both
born
on
the
same
day
what
do
you
think
of
that
any
little
thing
will
help
us
out
a
lot
how
about
it
he
went
outside
before
the
end
of
this
colloquy
but
presently
saw
the
woman
and
her
child
emerge
and
walk
on
disconsolately
toward
the
next
studio
thus
began
another
period
of
waiting
from
which
much
of
the
glamour
had
gone
it
was
not
so
easy
now
to
be
excited
by
those
glimpses
of
the
street
beyond
the
gate
a
certain
haze
had
vanished
leaving
all
too
apparent
the
circumstance
that
others
were
working
beyond
the
gate
while
merton
gill
loitered
outside
his
talent
his
training
ignored
his
early
air
of
careless
confidence
had
changed
to
one
not
at
all
careless
or
confident
he
was
looking
rather
desperate
and
rather
unbelieving
and
it
daily
grew
easier
to
count
his
savings
he
made
no
mistakes
now
his
hoard
no
longer
enjoyed
the
addition
of
fifteen
dollars
a
week
only
subtractions
were
made
there
came
a
morning
when
but
one
bill
remained
it
was
a
bill
bearing
at
its
centre
a
portrait
of
andrew
jackson
he
studied
it
in
consternation
though
still
permitting
himself
to
notice
that
jackson
would
have
made
a
good
type
the
long
narrow
severe
face
the
stiff
uncomprising
mane
of
gray
hair
probably
they
would
have
cast
him
for
a
feuding
mountaineer
deadly
with
his
rifle
or
perhaps
as
an
inventor
whose
device
was
stolen
on
his
by
his
wicked
wall
street
partner
thus
leaving
his
motherless
daughter
at
the
mercy
of
society
s
wolves
but
this
was
not
the
part
that
jackson
played
in
the
gripping
drama
of
merton
gill
his
face
merely
stared
from
the
last
money
brought
from
simsbury
illinois
and
the
stare
was
not
reassuring
it
seemed
to
say
that
there
was
no
other
money
in
all
the
world
decidedly
things
must
take
a
turn
merton
gill
had
a
quite
definite
feeling
that
he
had
already
struggled
and
sacrificed
enough
to
give
the
public
something
better
and
finer
it
was
time
the
public
realized
this
still
he
waited
not
even
again
reaching
the
heart
of
things
for
his
friend
beyond
the
window
had
suffered
no
relapse
he
came
to
resent
a
certain
inconsequence
in
the
woman
she
might
have
had
those
headaches
oftener
he
had
been
led
to
suppose
that
she
would
and
now
she
continued
to
be
weary
but
entirely
well
more
waiting
and
the
bill
went
for
a
five
and
some
silver
he
was
illogically
not
sorry
to
be
rid
of
andrew
jackson
who
had
looked
so
tragically
skeptical
the
bill
was
much
more
cheerful
it
bore
the
portrait
of
benjamin
harrison
a
smooth
cheerful
face
adorned
with
whiskers
that
radiated
success
they
were
little
short
of
smug
with
success
he
would
almost
rather
have
had
benjamin
harrison
on
five
dollars
than
the
jackson
on
ten
still
facts
were
facts
you
couldn
t
wait
as
long
on
five
dollars
as
you
could
on
ten
then
on
the
afternoon
of
a
day
that
promised
to
end
as
other
days
had
ended
a
wave
of
animation
swept
through
the
waiting
room
and
the
casting
office
swell
cabaret
stuff
was
the
phrase
that
brought
the
applicants
to
a
lively
swarm
about
the
little
window
evening
clothes
glad
wraps
cigarette
cases
the
victor
people
doing
the
blight
of

with
muriel
mercer
stage
number
four
at
morning
there
seemed
no
limit
to
the
people
desired
merton
gill
joined
the
throng
about
the
window
engagements
were
rapidly
made
both
through
the
window
and
over
the
telephone
that
was
now
ringing
those
people
who
had
so
long
been
told
that
there
was
nothing
he
did
not
push
ahead
of
the
women
as
some
of
the
other
men
did
he
even
stood
out
of
the
line
for
the
montague
girl
who
had
suddenly
appeared
and
who
from
the
rear
had
been
exclaiming
women
and
children
first
thanks

she
acknowledged
the
courtesy
and
beamed
through

goo
she
stepped
aside
with
you
re
next
brother
merton
gill
acknowledged
this
with
a
haughty
inclination
of
the
head
he
must
not
encourage
this
hoyden
he
glanced
expectantly
through
the
little
window
his
friend
held
a
telephone
receiver
at
her
ear
she
smiled
wearily
all
right
son

stage

at
goo
i
want
to
thank
you
for
this
opportunity
he
began
but
was
pushed
aside
by
an
athletic
young
woman
who
spoke
from
under
a
broad
hat
hullo
dearie
how
about
me
and
ella
hullo
maizie
all
right
stage
four
at
in
your
swellest
evening
at
the
door
the
montague
girl
called
to
an
approaching
group
who
seemed
to
have
heard
by
wireless
or
occult
means
the
report
of
new
activity
in
the
casting
office
hurry
you
troupers
you
can
eat
night
maybe
they
hurried
she
turned
to
merton
gill
seems
like
old
times
she
observed
does
it
he
replied
coldly
would
this
chit
never
understand
that
he
disapproved
of
her
trifling
ways
he
went
on
rejoicing
that
he
had
not
been
compelled
to
part
even
temporarily
with
a
suit
hitherto
worn
only
in
the
privacy
of
lowell
hardy
s
studio
it
would
have
been
awkward
he
thought
if
the
demand
for
it
had
been
much
longer
delayed
he
would
surely
have
let
that
go
before
sacrificing
his
buck
benson
outfit
he
had
traversed
the
eucalyptus
avenue
in
this
ecstasy
and
was
on
a
busier
thoroughfare
before
a
theatre
he
paused
to
study
the
billing
of
muriel
mercer
in
hearts
aflame
the
beauteous
girl
in
an
alarming
gown
was
at
the
mercy
of
a
fiend
in
evening
dress
whose
hellish
purpose
was
all
too
plainly
read
in
his
fevered
eyes
the
girl
writhed
in
his
grasp
doubtless
he
was
demanding
her
hand
in
marriage
it
was
a
tense
bit
and
he
would
act
with
this
petted
idol
of
the
screen
and
under
the
direction
of
that
henshaw
who
seemed
to
take
screen
art
with
proper
seriousness
he
wondered
if
by
any
chance
henshaw
would
call
upon
him
to
do
a
quadruple
transition
hate
fear
love
despair
he
practised
a
few
transitions
as
he
went
on
to
press
his
evening
clothes
in
the
patterson
kitchen
and
to
dream
that
night
that
he
rode
his
good
old
pal
pinto
into
the
gilded
cabaret
to
carry
off
muriel
mercer
broadway
s
pampered
society
pet
to
the
clean
life
out
there
in
the
open
spaces
where
men
are
men
at
eight
the
following
morning
he
was
made
up
in
a
large
dressing
room
by
a
grumbling
extra
who
said
that
it
was
a
dog
s
life
plastering
grease
paint
over
the
maps
of
dubs
he
was
presently
on
stage
four
in
the
prescribed
evening
regalia
for
gentlemen
he
found
the
cabaret
set
a
gilded
haunt
of
pleasure
with
small
tables
set
about
an
oblong
of
dancing
floor
back
of
these
on
three
sides
were
raised
platforms
with
other
tables
and
above
these
discreet
boxes
half
masked
by
drapery
for
the
seclusion
of
more
retiring
the
scene
was
deserted
as
yet
but
presently
he
was
joined
by
another
early
comer
a
beautiful
young
woman
of
spanish
type
with
a
thin
face
and
eager
dark
eyes
her
gown
was
glistening
black
set
low
about
her
polished
shoulders
and
she
carried
a
red
rose
so
exotic
did
she
appear
he
was
surprised
when
she
addressed
him
in
the
purest
english
say
listen
here
old
timer
let
s
pick
a
good
table
right
on
the
edge
before
the
mob
scene
starts
lem
me
see
she
glanced
up
and
down
the
rows
of
tables
the
cam
ras
ll
be
back
there
so
we
can
set
a
little
closer
but
not
too
close
or
we
ll
be
moved
over
how
bout
this
here
let
s
try
she
sat
motioning
him
to
the
other
chair
even
so
early
in
his
picture
career
did
he
detect
that
in
facing
this
girl
his
back
would
be
to
the
camera
he
hitched
his
chair
about
that
s
right
said
the
girl
i
wasn
t
meaning
to
hog
it
say
we
was
just
in
time
wasn
t
we
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
evening
dress
were
already
entering
they
looked
inquiringly
about
and
chose
tables
those
next
to
the
dancing
space
were
quickly
filled
many
of
the
ladies
permitted
costly
wraps
of
fur
or
brocade
to
spill
across
the
backs
of
their
chairs
many
of
the
gentlemen
lighted
cigarettes
from
gleaming
metal
cases
there
was
a
lively
interchange
of
talk
we
better
light
up
too
said
the
dark
girl
merton
gill
had
neglected
cigarettes
and
confessed
this
with
some
embarrassment
the
girl
presented
an
open
case
of
gold
attached
to
a
chain
pendent
from
her
girdle
they
both
smoked
on
their
table
were
small
plates
two
wine
glasses
half
filled
with
a
pale
liquid
and
small
spirals
of
smoke
ascended
over
a
finished
repast
of
course
if
the
part
called
for
cigarettes
you
must
smoke
whether
you
had
quit
or
not
the
places
back
of
the
prized
first
row
were
now
filling
up
with
the
later
comers
one
of
these
a
man
of
middle
age
he
would
surely
be
a
wealthy
accustomed
to
command
tables
regarded
the
filled
row
around
the
dancing
space
with
frank
irritation
and
paused
significantly
at
merton
s
side
he
seemed
about
to
voice
a
demand
but
the
young
actor
glanced
slowly
up
at
him
achieving
a
superb
transition
surprise
annoyance
and
as
the
invader
turned
quickly
away
pitying
contempt
atta
boy
said
his
companion
who
was
with
the
aid
of
a
tiny
mirror
suspended
with
the
cigarette
case
heightening
the
crimson
of
her
full
lips
two
cameras
were
now
in
view
and
men
were
sighting
through
them
merton
saw
henshaw
plump
but
worried
looking
scan
the
scene
from
the
rear
he
gave
hurried
direction
to
an
assistant
who
came
down
the
line
of
tables
with
a
running
glance
at
their
occupants
he
made
changes
a
couple
here
and
a
couple
there
would
be
moved
from
the
first
row
and
other
couples
would
come
to
take
their
places
under
the
eyes
of
this
assistant
the
spanish
girl
had
become
coquettish
with
veiled
glances
with
flashing
smiles
from
the
red
lips
with
a
small
gloved
hand
upon
merton
gill
s
sleeve
she
allured
him
the
assistant
paused
before
them
the
spanish
girl
continued
to
allure
merton
gill
stared
moodily
at
the
wine
glass
then
exhaled
smoke
as
he
glanced
up
at
his
companion
in
profound
ennui
if
it
was
the
blight
of
broadway
probably
they
would
want
him
to
look
bored
you
two
stay
where
you
are
said
the
assistant
and
passed
on
good
work
said
the
girl
i
knew
you
was
a
type
the
minute
i
made
musicians
entered
an
orchestra
loft
far
down
the
set
the
voice
of
henshaw
came
through
a
megaphone
everybody
that
s
near
the
floor
in
a
moment
the
space
was
thronged
with
dancers
another
voice
called
kick
it
and
a
glare
of
light
came
on
you
an
me
both
said
the
spanish
girl
rising
merton
gill
remained
seated
can
t
he
said
sprained
how
was
he
to
tell
her
that
there
had
been
no
chance
to
learn
this
dance
back
in
simsbury
illinois
where
such
things
were
frowned
upon
by
pulpit
and
press
the
girl
resumed
her
seat
at
first
with
annoyance
then
brightened
all
right
at
that
she
said
i
bet
we
get
more
footage
this
she
again
became
coquettish
luring
with
her
wiles
one
who
remained
sunk
in
ennui
a
whistle
blew
a
voice
called
save
it
and
the
lights
jarred
off
henshaw
came
trippingly
down
the
line
you
people
didn
t
dance
what
s
the
matter
merton
gill
glanced
up
doing
a
double
transition
from
dignified
surprise
to
smiling
chagrin
sprained
ankle
he
said
and
fell
into
the
bored
look
that
had
served
him
with
the
assistant
he
exhaled
smoke
and
raised
his
tired
eyes
to
the
still
luring
spanish
girl
weariness
of
the
world
and
women
was
in
his
look
henshaw
scanned
him
closely
all
right
stay
there
keep
just
that
way
it
s
what
i
he
continued
down
the
line
which
had
become
hushed
now
people
i
want
some
flashes
along
here
between
dances
see
what
i
mean
you
re
talking
but
you
re
bored
with
it
all
the
hollowness
of
this
night
life
is
getting
you
not
all
of
you
most
of
you
girls
can
keep
on
smiling
but
the
blight
of
broadway
shows
on
many
you
re
beginning
to
wonder
if
this
is
all
life
has
to
offer
see
what
i
mean
he
continued
down
the
line
from
the
table
back
of
merton
gill
came
a
voice
in
speech
to
the
retreating
back
of
henshaw
all
right
old
top
but
it
ll
take
a
good
lens
to
catch
any
blight
on
this
bunch
most
of
em
haven
t
worked
a
lick
in
six
weeks
and
they
re
tickled
he
knew
without
turning
that
this
was
the
montague
girl
trying
to
be
funny
at
the
expense
of
henshaw
who
was
safely
beyond
hearing
he
thought
she
would
be
a
disturbing
element
in
the
scene
but
in
this
he
was
wrong
for
he
bent
upon
the
wine
glass
a
look
more
than
ever
fraught
with
jaded
the
babble
of
broadway
was
resumed
as
henshaw
went
back
to
the
cameras
presently
a
camera
was
pushed
forward
merton
gill
hardly
dared
look
up
but
he
knew
it
was
halted
at
no
great
distance
from
him
now
here
s
rather
a
good
little
bit
henshaw
was
saying
you
there
the
girl
in
black
go
on
tease
him
the
way
you
were
and
he
s
to
give
you
that
same
look
got
that
cigarette
going
all
ready
lights
camera
merton
was
achieving
his
first
under
the
hum
of
the
lights
he
was
thinking
that
he
had
been
a
fool
not
to
learn
dancing
no
matter
how
the
reverend
otto
carmichael
denounced
it
as
a
survival
from
the
barbaric
congo
he
was
also
thinking
that
the
montague
girl
ought
to
be
kept
away
from
people
who
were
trying
to
do
really
creative
things
and
he
was
bitterly
regretting
that
he
had
no
silver
cigarette
case
the
gloom
of
his
young
face
was
honest
gloom
he
was
aware
that
his
companion
leaned
vivaciously
toward
him
with
gay
chatter
and
gestures
very
slowly
he
inhaled
from
a
cigarette
that
was
already
distasteful
adding
no
little
to
the
desired
effect
and
very
slowly
he
exhaled
as
he
raised
to
hers
the
bored
eyes
of
a
soul
quite
disillusioned
here
indeed
was
the
blight
of
broadway
all
right
first
rate
called
henshaw
now
get
this
bunch
down
the
camera
was
pushed
on
gee
that
was
luck
said
the
girl
of
course
it
ll
be
cut
to
a
flash
but
i
bet
we
stand
out
at
she
was
excited
now
no
longer
needing
to
act
from
the
table
back
of
merton
came
the
voice
of
the
montague
girl
yes
one
must
suffer
for
one
s
art
here
i
got
to
be
a
when
i
d
rather
be
simple
little
madelon
beloved
by
all
in
the
he
restrained
an
impulse
to
look
around
at
her
she
was
not
serious
and
should
not
be
encouraged
farther
down
the
set
henshaw
was
beseeching
a
table
of
six
revellers
to
give
him
a
little
hollow
gayety
you
re
simply
forcing
yourselves
to
have
a
good
time
he
was
saying
remember
that
your
hearts
aren
t
in
it
you
know
this
night
life
is
a
mockery
still
you
re
playing
the
game
now
two
of
you
raise
your
glasses
to
drink
you
at
the
end
stand
up
and
hold
your
glass
aloft
the
girl
next
to
you
there
stand
up
by
him
and
raise
your
face
to
his
turn
sideways
more
that
s
it
put
your
hand
up
to
his
shoulder
you
re
slightly
lit
you
know
and
you
re
inviting
him
to
kiss
you
over
his
glass
you
others
you
re
drinking
gay
enough
but
see
if
you
can
get
over
that
it
s
only
you
at
the
other
end
there
you
re
staring
at
your
wine
glass
then
you
look
slowly
up
at
your
partner
but
without
any
life
you
re
feeling
the
blight
see
a
chap
down
the
line
here
just
did
it
perfectly
all
ready
now
lights
camera
you
blonde
girl
stand
up
face
raised
to
him
hand
up
to
his
shoulder
you
others
drinking
laughing
you
at
the
end
look
up
slowly
at
the
girl
look
away
about
there
bored
weary
of
it
all
cut
all
right
not
so
bad
now
this
next
bunch
merton
gill
was
beginning
to
loathe
cigarettes
he
wondered
if
henshaw
would
mind
if
he
didn
t
smoke
so
much
except
of
course
in
the
his
throat
was
dry
and
rough
his
voice
husky
his
companion
had
evidently
played
more
smoking
parts
and
seemed
not
to
mind
it
henshaw
was
now
opposite
them
across
the
dancing
floor
warning
his
people
to
be
gay
but
not
too
gay
the
glamour
of
this
night
life
must
be
a
little
dulled
now
paul
get
about
three
medium
shots
along
here
there
s
a
good
table
get
that
bunch
and
not
quite
so
solemn
people
don
t
overdo
it
you
think
you
re
having
a
good
time
even
if
it
does
turn
to
ashes
in
your
mouth
now
ready
lights
camera
i
like
western
stuff
better
confided
merton
to
his
companion
she
considered
this
though
retaining
her
arch
manner
well
i
don
t
know
i
done
a
carmencita
part
in
a
scene
last
month
over
to
the
bigart
and
right
in
the
mi
st
of
the
fight
i
get
a
glass
of
somethin
all
over
my
gown
that
practically
rooned
it
i
guess
i
rather
do
this
refined
cabaret
stuff
at
least
you
ain
t
so
li
ble
to
roon
a
gown
still
and
all
after
you
been
warmin
the
extra
bench
for
a
month
one
can
t
be
choosy
say
there
s
the
princ
ples
comin
on
the
he
looked
around
there
indeed
was
the
beautiful
muriel
mercer
radiant
in
an
evening
frock
of
silver
at
the
moment
she
was
putting
a
few
last
touches
to
her
perfect
face
from
a
box
held
by
a
maid
standing
with
her
was
another
young
woman
not
nearly
so
beautiful
and
three
men
henshaw
was
instructing
these
presently
he
called
through
his
megaphone
you
people
are
excited
by
the
entrance
of
the
famous
vera
vanderpool
and
her
friends
you
stop
drinking
break
off
your
talk
stare
at
her
see
what
i
mean
she
makes
a
sensation
music
lights
camera
down
the
set
escorted
by
a
deferential
came
muriel
mercer
on
the
arm
of
a
man
who
was
elaborately
garnished
but
whose
thin
dyed
mustaches
partially
bald
head
and
heavy
eyes
proclaimed
him
to
merton
gill
as
one
who
meant
the
girl
no
good
they
were
followed
by
the
girl
who
was
not
so
beautiful
and
the
other
two
men
these
were
young
chaps
of
pleasing
exterior
who
made
the
progress
laughingly
the
five
were
seated
at
a
table
next
the
dancing
space
at
the
far
end
they
chatted
gayly
as
the
older
man
ordered
importantly
from
the
muriel
mercer
tapped
one
of
the
younger
men
with
her
plumed
fan
and
they
danced
three
other
selected
couples
danced
at
the
same
time
though
taking
care
not
to
come
between
the
star
and
the
grinding
camera
the
older
man
leered
at
the
star
and
nervously
lighted
a
cigarette
which
he
immediately
discarded
after
one
savage
bite
at
it
it
could
be
seen
that
vera
vanderpool
was
the
gayest
of
all
that
gay
throng
upon
her
as
yet
had
come
no
blight
of
broadway
though
she
shrank
perceptibly
when
the
partially
bald
one
laid
his
hand
on
her
slender
wrist
as
she
resumed
her
seat
food
and
wine
were
brought
vera
vanderpool
drank
with
a
pretty
flourish
of
her
glass
now
the
two
cameras
were
moved
forward
for
the
older
man
was
caught
leering
at
vera
it
would
surely
be
seen
that
he
was
not
one
to
trust
vera
was
caught
with
the
mad
light
of
pleasure
in
her
beautiful
eyes
henshaw
was
now
speaking
in
low
tones
to
the
group
and
presently
vera
vanderpool
did
a
transition
the
mad
light
of
pleasure
died
from
her
eyes
and
the
smile
froze
on
her
beautiful
mouth
a
look
almost
of
terror
came
into
her
eyes
followed
by
a
pathetic
lift
of
the
upper
lip
she
stared
intently
above
the
camera
she
was
beholding
some
evil
thing
far
from
that
palace
of
revels
now
they
ll
cut
back
to
the
stuff
they
shot
last
week
explained
the
spanish
girl
tenement
house
queried
merton
but
i
thought
the
story
would
be
that
she
falls
in
love
with
a
man
from
the
great
spaces
out
west
and
goes
out
there
to
live
a
clean
open
life
with
him
that
s
the
way
i
thought
it
would
be
out
there
where
she
could
forget
the
blight
of
no
mercer
never
does
western
stuff
i
got
a
little
girl
friend
workin
with
her
and
she
told
me
about
this
story
mercer
gets
into
this
tenement
house
down
on
the
east
side
and
she
s
a
careless
society
butterfly
but
all
at
once
she
sees
what
a
lot
of
sorrow
there
is
in
this
world
when
she
sees
these
people
in
the
tenement
house
starving
to
death
and
sick
kids
and
everything
and
this
little
friend
of
mine
does
an
italian
girl
with
a
baby
and
this
old
man
here
he
s
a
rich
swell
and
prominent
in
wall
street
and
belongs
to
all
the
clubs
but
he
s
the
father
of
this
girl
s
child
only
mercer
don
t
know
that
yet
but
she
gets
aroused
in
her
better
nature
by
the
sight
of
all
this
trouble
and
she
almost
falls
in
love
with
another
gentleman
who
devotes
all
his
time
to
relieving
the
poor
in
these
tenements
it
was
him
who
took
her
there
but
still
she
likes
a
good
time
as
well
as
anybody
and
she
s
stickin
around
broadway
and
around
this
old
guy
who
s
pretty
good
company
in
spite
of
his
faults
but
just
now
she
got
a
shock
at
remembering
the
horrible
sights
she
has
seen
she
can
t
get
it
out
of
her
mind
and
pretty
soon
she
ll
see
this
other
gentleman
that
she
nearly
fell
in
love
with
the
one
who
hangs
around
these
tenements
doing
good
he
ll
be
over
at
one
of
them
tables
and
she
ll
leave
her
party
and
go
over
to
his
table
and
say
take
me
from
this
heartless
broadway
to
your
tenements
where
i
can
relieve
their
suffering
so
she
goes
out
and
gets
in
a
taxi
with
him
leaving
the
old
guy
with
not
a
thing
to
do
but
pay
the
check
of
course
he
s
mad
and
he
follows
her
down
to
the
tenements
where
she
s
relieving
the
poor
just
in
a
plain
black
dress
and
she
finds
out
he
s
the
real
father
of
this
little
friend
of
mine
s
child
and
tells
him
to
go
back
to
broadway
while
she
has
chosen
the
better
part
and
must
live
her
life
with
these
real
people
but
he
sends
her
a
note
that
s
supposed
to
be
from
a
poor
woman
dying
of
something
to
come
and
bring
her
some
medicine
and
she
goes
off
alone
to
this
dive
in
another
street
and
it
s
the
old
guy
himself
who
has
sent
the
note
and
he
has
her
there
in
this
cellar
in
his
power
but
the
other
gentleman
has
found
the
note
and
has
follered
her
and
breaks
in
the
door
and
puts
up
a
swell
fight
with
the
old
guy
and
some
toughs
he
has
hired
and
gets
her
off
safe
and
sound
and
so
they
re
married
and
live
the
real
life
far
away
from
the
blight
of
broadway
it
s
a
swell
story
all
right
but
mercer
can
t
act
it
this
little
friend
of
mine
can
act
all
around
her
she
d
be
a
star
if
only
she
was
better
lookin
you
bet
mercer
don
t
allow
any
lookers
on
the
same
set
with
her
do
you
make
that
one
at
the
table
with
her
now
just
got
looks
enough
to
show
mercer
off
mercer
s
i
ll
give
her
that
but
for
actin
say
all
they
need
in
a
piece
for
her
is
just
some
stuff
to
go
in
between
her
don
t
make
much
difference
what
it
is
oh
look
there
comes
the
dancers
it
s
luzon
and
merton
gill
looked
these
would
be
hired
dancers
to
entertain
the
throng
a
young
girl
with
vine
leaves
in
her
hair
and
a
dark
young
man
of
barbaric
appearance
the
girl
was
clad
in
a
mere
whisp
of
a
girdle
and
shining
breast
plates
while
the
man
was
arrayed
chiefly
in
a
coating
of
dark
stain
they
swirled
over
the
dance
floor
to
the
broken
rhythm
of
the
orchestra
now
clinging
now
apart
working
to
a
climax
in
which
the
man
poised
with
his
partner
perched
upon
one
shoulder
through
the
megaphone
came
instructions
to
applaud
the
couple
and
broadway
applauded
all
but
merton
gill
who
stared
moodily
into
his
coffee
cup
or
lifted
bored
eyes
to
the
scene
of
revelry
he
was
not
bored
but
his
various
emotions
combined
to
produce
this
effect
very
plausibly
he
was
dismayed
at
this
sudden
revelation
of
art
in
the
dance
so
near
him
imogene
pulver
had
once
done
an
art
dance
back
in
simsbury
at
the
cantata
of
esther
in
the
vestry
of
the
methodist
church
and
had
been
not
a
little
criticised
for
her
daring
but
imogene
had
been
abundantly
clad
and
her
gestures
much
more
restrained
he
was
trying
now
to
picture
how
gashwiler
would
take
a
thing
like
this
or
gashwiler
for
that
matter
one
glimpse
of
those
practically
unclad
bodies
skipping
and
bounding
there
would
probably
throw
them
into
a
panic
they
couldn
t
have
sat
it
through
and
here
he
was
right
up
in
front
of
them
and
not
turning
a
hair
this
reflection
permitted
something
of
the
contemptuous
to
show
in
the
random
glances
with
which
he
swept
the
dancers
he
could
not
look
at
them
steadily
not
when
they
were
close
as
they
often
were
also
he
loathed
the
cigarette
he
was
smoking
the
tolerant
scorn
for
the
gashwilers
and
his
feeling
for
the
cigarette
brought
him
again
into
favourable
notice
he
heard
henshaw
but
did
not
look
up
get
another
flash
here
paul
he
s
rather
a
good
little
henshaw
now
stood
beside
him
hold
that
he
said
no
he
spoke
to
merton
s
companion
you
change
seats
a
minute
with
miss
montague
as
if
you
d
got
tired
of
him
see
what
i
mean
miss
montague
miss
the
spanish
girl
arose
seeming
not
wholly
pleased
at
this
bit
of
directing
the
montague
girl
came
to
the
table
she
was
a
blithesome
sprite
in
a
dancing
frock
her
blonde
curls
fell
low
over
one
eye
which
she
now
cocked
inquiringly
at
the
director
you
re
trying
to
liven
him
up
explained
henshaw
that
s
all
him
he
ll
do
the
rest
he
s
quite
a
good
little
the
montague
girl
flopped
into
the
chair
leaned
roguishly
toward
merton
gill
placed
a
small
hand
upon
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
and
peered
archly
at
him
through
beaded
lashes
one
eye
almost
hidden
by
its
thatch
of
curls
merton
gill
sunk
low
in
his
chair
cynically
tapped
the
ash
from
his
tenth
cigarette
into
the
coffee
cup
and
raised
bored
eyes
to
hers
that
s
it
shoot
it
paul
just
a
the
camera
was
being
wheeled
toward
them
the
montague
girl
with
her
hand
still
on
his
arm
continued
her
wheedling
though
now
she
spoke
why
look
who
s
here
kid
i
didn
t
know
you
in
your
clothes
say
listen
why
do
you
always
upstage
me
i
never
done
a
thing
to
you
did
i
go
on
now
give
me
the
fishy
eye
again
how
d
you
ace
yourself
into
this
first
row
anyway
did
you
have
to
fight
for
it
say
your
friend
ll
be
mad
at
me
putting
her
out
of
here
won
t
she
well
blame
it
on
the
gelatin
master
i
never
suggested
it
say
you
got
henshaw
going
he
likes
that
blighted
look
of
he
made
no
reply
to
this
chatter
he
must
keep
in
the
picture
he
merely
favoured
her
with
a
glance
of
fatigued
indifference
the
camera
was
focused
all
ready
you
people
do
like
i
said
now
lights
camera
merton
gill
drew
upon
his
cigarette
with
the
utmost
disrelish
raised
the
cold
eyes
of
a
disillusioned
man
to
the
face
of
the
leering
montague
girl
turned
aside
from
her
with
every
sign
of
apathy
and
wearily
exhaled
the
smoke
there
seemed
to
be
but
this
one
pleasure
left
to
him
cut
said
henshaw
and
somewhere
lights
jarred
off
just
stick
there
a
bit
miss
montague
we
ll
have
a
couple
more
shots
when
the
dancing
merton
resented
this
change
he
preferred
the
other
girl
she
lured
him
but
not
in
so
pronounced
so
flagrant
a
manner
the
blight
of
broadway
became
more
apparent
than
ever
upon
his
face
the
girl
s
hand
still
fluttered
upon
his
sleeve
as
the
music
came
and
dancers
shuffled
by
them
say
you
re
the
actin
kid
all
she
was
tapping
the
floor
with
the
heel
of
a
satin
slipper
he
wished
above
all
things
that
she
wouldn
t
call
him
he
meditated
putting
a
little
of
broadway
s
blight
upon
her
by
saying
in
a
dignified
way
that
his
real
name
was
clifford
armytage
still
this
might
not
blight
her
you
couldn
t
tell
about
the
girl
you
certainly
are
the
actin
est
kid
on
this
set
i
ll
tell
the
lot
that
of
course
these
won
t
mean
much
just
about
one
second
or
half
that
maybe
or
some
hick
in
the
cuttin
room
may
kill
em
dead
come
on
give
me
the
again
that
s
it
say
i
m
glad
i
didn
t
have
to
smoke
cigarettes
in
this
scene
they
wouldn
t
do
for
my
type
standin
where
the
brook
and
river
meet
up
i
hate
a
cigarette
worse
n
anything
you
i
bet
you
d
give
up
food
i
hate
em
too
he
muttered
grudgingly
glad
to
be
able
to
say
this
even
though
only
to
one
whose
attentions
he
meant
to
discourage
if
i
have
to
smoke
one
more
it
ll
finish
now
ain
t
that
the
limit
too
bad
kid
i
didn
t
even
have
any
of
my
own
that
spanish
girl
gave
me
the
montague
girl
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
the
young
woman
whose
place
she
had
usurped
spanish
eh
if
she
s
spanish
i
m
a
swede
right
out
of
switzerland
i
never
could
like
to
smoke
i
started
to
learn
one
summer
when
i
was
eight
pa
and
ma
and
i
was
out
with
a
tent
me
doing
little
eva
and
between
acts
i
had
to
put
on
pants
and
come
out
and
do
a
smoking
song
all
about
a
kid
learning
to
smoke
his
first
cigar
and
not
doin
well
with
it
see
but
they
had
to
cut
it
out
gosh
what
us
artists
suffer
at
times
pa
had
me
try
it
a
couple
of
years
later
when
i
was
doin
louise
the
blind
girl
in
the
two
orphans
playin
thirty
cents
top
it
was
a
good
song
all
right
with
lots
of
funny
gags
i
d
a
been
the
laughing
hit
of
the
bill
if
i
could
a
learned
not
to
swallow
we
had
to
cut
it
out
again
after
the
second
night
talk
about
entering
into
your
part
me
i
was
too
if
the
distant
camera
glanced
this
way
it
caught
merely
the
persistent
efforts
of
a
beautiful
debutante
who
had
not
yet
felt
the
blight
of
broadway
to
melt
the
cynicism
of
one
who
suffered
it
more
and
more
acutely
each
moment
her
hand
fluttered
on
his
sleeve
and
her
left
eye
continuously
beguiled
him
from
under
the
overhanging
curl
as
often
as
he
thought
it
desirable
he
put
the
bored
glance
upon
her
though
mostly
he
stared
in
dejection
at
the
coffee
cup
or
the
empty
wine
glass
he
was
sorry
that
she
had
had
that
trouble
with
the
cigar
but
one
who
as
little
eva
or
poor
persecuted
louise
the
blind
girl
had
to
do
a
song
and
dance
between
the
acts
must
surely
come
from
a
low
plane
of
art
he
was
relieved
when
at
megaphoned
directions
an
elderly
fop
came
to
whirl
her
off
in
the
dance
her
last
speech
was
that
poor
henshaw
the
gelatin
master
ll
have
by
he
was
left
alone
at
his
table
he
wondered
if
they
might
want
a
of
him
this
way
uncompanioned
jaded
tired
of
it
all
as
if
he
would
be
saying
there
s
always
the
river
but
nothing
of
this
sort
happened
there
was
more
dancing
more
of
muriel
mercer
being
stricken
with
her
vision
of
tenement
misery
under
the
foul
glare
of
a
roue
inflamed
with
wine
and
there
was
a
shot
of
muriel
perceiving
at
last
the
blight
of
broadway
and
going
to
a
table
at
which
sat
a
pale
young
man
with
a
high
forehead
who
presently
led
her
out
into
the
night
to
the
real
life
of
the
worthy
poor
later
the
deserted
admirer
became
again
a
roue
inflamed
with
wine
and
submitted
to
a
that
would
depict
his
baffled
rage
he
clenched
his
hands
in
this
and
seemed
to
convey
with
a
snarling
lift
of
his
lip
that
the
girl
would
yet
be
his
merton
gill
had
ceased
to
smoke
he
had
sounded
on
broadway
even
the
shallow
pleasure
of
cigarettes
he
was
thoroughly
blighted
at
last
a
megaphoned
announcement
from
the
assistant
director
dismissing
the
extras
keeping
the
star
the
lead
and
a
few
people
to
clean
up
medium
shots
dramatics
and
other
work
requiring
no
crowd
all
you
extra
people
here
morning
same
clothes
and
there
was
a
quick
breaking
up
of
the
revelry
the
broadway
threw
off
the
blight
and
stormed
the
assistant
director
for
slips
of
paper
which
he
was
now
issuing
merton
gill
received
one
labelled
talent
there
was
fine
print
upon
it
which
he
took
no
pains
to
read
beyond
gathering
its
general
effect
that
the
victor
company
had
the
full
right
to
use
any
photographs
of
him
that
its
agents
might
that
day
have
obtained
what
engrossed
him
to
the
exclusion
of
this
legal
formality
was
the
item
that
he
would
now
be
paid
seven
dollars
and
fifty
cents
for
his
day
s
work
and
once
he
had
been
forced
to
toil
half
a
week
for
this
sum
emerging
from
the
stage
into
the
sunlight
he
encountered
the
montague
girl
who
hailed
him
as
he
would
have
turned
to
avoid
her
say
trouper
i
thought
i
d
tell
you
in
case
you
didn
t
know
we
don
t
take
our
slips
to
that
dame
in
that
outside
cafeteria
any
more
she
always
pinches
off
a
quarter
or
may
be
four
bits
they
got
it
fixed
now
so
the
cash
is
always
on
tap
in
the
office
i
just
thought
i
d
tell
thanks
he
said
still
with
the
jaded
air
of
the
disillusioned
he
had
only
the
vaguest
notion
of
her
meaning
but
her
intention
had
been
kindly
thank
you
very
oh
don
t
mention
it
i
just
thought
i
d
tell
she
glanced
after
him
shrewdly
nearing
the
office
he
observed
a
long
line
of
broadway
revellers
waiting
to
cash
their
slips
its
head
was
lost
inside
the
building
and
it
trailed
far
outside
no
longer
was
any
blight
to
be
perceived
the
slips
were
ready
in
hand
instead
of
joining
the
line
merton
decided
upon
luncheon
it
was
two
o
clock
and
though
waiters
with
trays
had
been
abundant
in
the
gilded
cabaret
the
best
screen
art
had
not
seemed
to
demand
a
serving
of
actual
food
further
he
would
eat
in
the
cafeteria
in
evening
dress
his
still
on
like
a
real
actor
the
other
time
he
had
felt
conspicuous
because
nothing
had
identified
him
with
the
ordinary
clientele
of
the
place
the
room
was
not
crowded
now
only
a
table
here
and
there
held
late
comers
and
the
choice
of
foods
when
he
reached
the
serving
counter
at
the
back
was
limited
he
permitted
himself
to
complain
of
this
in
a
practised
manner
but
made
a
selection
and
bore
his
tray
to
the
centre
of
the
room
he
had
chosen
a
table
and
was
about
to
sit
when
he
detected
henshaw
farther
down
the
room
and
promptly
took
the
one
next
him
it
was
probable
that
henshaw
would
recall
him
and
praise
the
work
he
had
done
but
the
director
merely
rolled
unseeing
eyes
over
him
as
he
seated
himself
and
continued
his
speech
to
the
man
merton
had
before
seen
him
with
the
grizzled
dark
man
with
the
stubby
gray
mustache
whom
he
called
governor
merton
wondered
if
he
could
be
the
governor
of
california
but
decided
not
perhaps
an
she
s
working
out
well
he
was
saying
i
consider
it
one
of
the
best
continuities
belmore
has
done
not
a
line
of
smut
in
it
but
to
make
up
for
that
we
ll
have
over
thirty
changes
of
merton
gill
coughed
violently
then
stared
moodily
at
his
plate
of
baked
beans
he
hoped
that
this
at
least
would
recall
him
to
henshaw
who
might
fix
an
eye
on
him
to
say
and
by
the
way
here
is
a
young
actor
that
was
of
great
help
to
me
this
but
neither
man
even
glanced
up
seemingly
this
young
actor
could
choke
to
death
without
exciting
their
notice
he
stared
less
moodily
at
the
baked
beans
henshaw
would
notice
him
sometime
and
you
couldn
t
do
everything
at
once
the
men
had
finished
their
luncheon
and
were
smoking
the
animated
henshaw
continued
his
talk
and
about
that
other
thing
we
were
discussing
governor
i
want
to
go
into
that
with
you
i
tell
you
if
we
can
do
robinson
crusoe
and
do
it
right
a
regular
program
feature
the
thing
ought
to
gross
a
million
a
good
clean
picture
great
kid
show
run
forever
shipwreck
stuff
loading
the
raft
island
stuff
hut
stuff
goats
finding
the
footprint
cannibals
the
man
friday
can
t
you
see
it
the
governor
seemed
to
see
it
fine
that
s
so
he
stared
above
the
director
s
head
for
the
space
of
two
inhalations
from
his
cigarette
imbuing
merton
gill
with
gratitude
that
he
need
not
smoke
again
that
day
but
say
look
here
how
about
your
love
interest
henshaw
waved
this
aside
with
his
own
cigarette
and
began
to
make
marks
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
easy
enough
belmore
can
fix
that
up
we
talked
over
one
or
two
ways
how
about
having
friday
s
sister
brought
over
with
him
to
this
island
the
cannibals
are
going
to
eat
her
too
then
the
cannibals
run
to
their
canoes
when
they
hear
the
gun
just
the
same
as
in
the
book
and
crusoe
rescues
the
two
and
when
he
cuts
the
girl
s
bonds
he
finds
she
can
t
be
friday
s
real
sister
because
she
s
white
see
what
i
mean
well
we
work
it
out
later
that
she
s
the
daughter
of
an
english
earl
that
was
wrecked
near
the
cannibal
island
and
they
rescued
her
and
friday
s
mother
brought
her
up
as
her
own
child
she
s
saved
the
papers
that
came
ashore
and
she
has
the
earl
s
tattooed
on
her
shoulder
blade
and
finally
after
crusoe
has
fallen
in
love
with
her
and
she
s
remembered
a
good
deal
of
her
past
along
comes
the
old
earl
her
father
in
a
ship
and
rescues
them
all
how
about
that
henshaw
brightly
expectant
awaited
the
verdict
of
his
chief
well
i
don
t
the
other
considered
where
s
your
conflict
after
the
girl
is
saved
from
the
savages
and
crusoe
in
the
book
wears
a
long
beard
how
about
that
he
won
t
look
like
anything
sort
of
hairy
and
that
s
henshaw
from
the
envelope
on
which
he
drew
squares
and
oblongs
appeared
to
gain
fresh
inspiration
he
looked
up
with
new
light
in
his
eyes
i
got
it
got
the
whole
thing
modernize
it
this
chap
is
a
rich
young
new
yorker
cruising
on
his
yacht
and
he
s
wrecked
on
this
island
and
gets
a
lot
of
stuff
ashore
and
his
valet
is
saved
too
say
there
s
some
good
comedy
see
what
i
mean
valet
is
one
of
these
stiff
english
lads
never
been
wrecked
on
an
island
before
and
complains
all
the
time
about
the
lack
of
conveniences
i
can
see
a
lot
of
good
gags
for
him
having
to
milk
the
goats
and
getting
scared
of
the
other
animals
and
no
place
to
press
his
master
s
clothes
things
like
that
you
know
well
the
young
fellow
explores
the
island
and
finds
another
party
that
s
been
wrecked
on
the
other
side
and
it
s
the
girl
and
the
man
that
got
her
father
into
his
power
and
got
all
of
his
estate
and
is
going
to
make
beggars
of
them
if
the
girl
won
t
marry
him
and
she
comes
on
the
young
fellow
under
some
palms
and
they
fall
in
love
and
fix
it
up
to
the
villain
belmore
can
work
it
out
from
there
how
about
that
and
say
we
can
use
a
lot
of
trims
from
that
south
sea
piece
we
did
last
year
all
that
yacht
and
island
stuff
see
what
i
mean
the
other
considered
profoundly
yes
you
got
a
story
there
but
it
won
t
be
robinson
crusoe
don
t
you
see
again
henshaw
glanced
up
from
his
envelope
with
the
light
of
inspiration
well
how
about
this
call
it
robinson
crusoe
junior
there
you
are
we
get
the
value
of
the
name
and
do
the
story
the
way
we
want
it
the
young
fellow
being
shaved
every
day
by
the
valet
and
he
can
invite
the
other
party
over
to
dine
with
him
and
receive
them
in
evening
dress
and
everything
can
t
you
see
it
if
that
story
wouldn
t
gross
big
then
i
don
t
know
a
story
and
all
easy
stuff
we
can
use
the
trims
for
the
long
shots
and
use
that
inlet
toward
the
other
end
of
catalina
for
the
hut
and
the
beach
stuff
governor
and
robinson
crusoe
junior
is
a
cinch
well
give
belmore
as
much
dope
as
you
ve
got
and
see
what
he
can
work
they
arose
and
stood
by
the
counter
to
pay
their
checks
if
you
want
to
see
the
rushes
of
that
stuff
we
shot
this
morning
be
over
to
the
projection
room
at
five
said
henshaw
as
they
went
out
neither
had
observed
the
rising
young
screen
actor
clifford
armytage
though
he
had
coughed
violently
again
as
they
left
he
had
coughed
most
plausibly
moreover
because
of
the
cigarettes
at
the
cashier
s
window
no
longer
obstructed
he
received
his
money
another
bill
adorned
with
the
cheerfully
prosperous
face
of
benjamin
harrison
and
half
that
amount
in
silver
coin
then
although
loath
to
do
this
he
went
to
the
dressing
room
and
removed
his
that
grease
paint
had
given
him
a
world
of
confidence
at
the
casting
office
he
stopped
to
tell
his
friend
of
the
day
s
camera
triumph
how
the
director
had
seemed
to
single
him
out
from
a
hundred
or
so
revellers
to
portray
facially
the
deadly
effect
of
broadway
s
night
life
good
work
she
applauded
before
long
you
ll
be
having
jobs
oftener
and
don
t
forget
you
re
called
again
morning
for
the
she
was
a
funny
woman
always
afraid
he
would
forget
something
he
could
not
possibly
forget
once
more
in
the
patterson
kitchen
he
pressed
his
suit
and
dreamt
of
new
eminences
in
his
chosen
art
the
following
morning
he
was
again
the
first
to
reach
the
long
dressing
room
the
first
to
be
made
up
by
the
grumbling
extra
the
first
to
reach
the
big
stage
the
cabaret
of
yesterday
had
overnight
been
transformed
into
a
palatial
gambling
hell
along
the
sides
of
the
room
and
at
its
centre
were
tables
equipped
for
strange
games
of
chance
which
only
his
picture
knowledge
enabled
him
to
recognize
he
might
tarry
at
these
tables
he
thought
but
he
must
remember
to
look
bored
in
the
near
presence
of
henshaw
the
spanish
girl
of
yesterday
appeared
and
he
greeted
her
warmly
i
got
some
cigarettes
this
time
he
said
so
let
me
pay
you
back
all
those
i
smoked
of
yours
together
they
filled
the
golden
case
that
hung
from
her
girdle
it
s
swell
all
right
said
the
girl
gazing
about
the
vast
room
now
filling
with
richly
clad
gamblers
but
i
thought
it
was
all
over
except
the
scenes
where
vera
vanderpool
has
gone
to
relieve
the
poor
he
said
the
girl
explained
this
scene
comes
before
the
one
we
did
yesterday
it
s
where
the
rich
old
boy
first
sees
vera
playing
roulette
and
she
loses
a
lot
of
money
and
is
going
to
leave
her
string
of
pearls
but
he
says
it
s
a
mere
trifle
and
let
him
pay
her
gambling
losses
so
in
a
weak
moment
she
does
and
that
s
how
he
starts
to
get
her
into
his
power
you
ll
see
how
it
works
out
say
they
spent
some
money
on
this
set
all
it
was
indeed
a
rich
set
as
the
girl
had
said
it
seemed
to
merton
gill
that
it
would
be
called
on
the
screen
one
of
those
plague
spots
that
eat
like
a
cancer
at
the
heart
of
new
he
lighted
a
cigarette
and
leaned
nonchalantly
against
a
pillar
to
smile
a
tired
little
smile
at
the
victims
of
this
life
who
were
now
grouping
around
the
roulette
and
faro
tables
he
must
try
for
his
jaded
look
some
swell
shack
the
speaker
was
back
of
him
but
he
knew
her
for
the
montague
girl
and
was
instantly
enabled
to
increase
the
blighted
look
for
which
he
had
been
trying
one
natty
little
hovel
i
ll
tell
the
world
the
girl
continued
say
this
puts
it
all
over
the
grand
central
station
don
t
it
must
be
right
smack
at
the
corner
of
broadway
and
fifth
avenue
well
start
the
little
ball
rolling
so
i
can
make
a
he
turned
his
head
slightly
and
saw
her
dance
off
to
one
of
the
roulette
tables
accompanied
by
the
fop
who
had
been
her
companion
yesterday
henshaw
and
his
assistant
now
appeared
and
began
grouping
the
players
at
the
various
tables
merton
gill
remained
leaning
wearily
against
his
massive
pillar
trying
to
appear
blase
under
the
chatter
of
the
spanish
girl
the
groups
were
arranged
to
the
liking
of
henshaw
though
only
after
many
trials
the
roulette
ball
was
twirled
and
the
lively
rattle
of
chips
could
be
heard
scanning
his
scene
he
noted
merton
and
his
companion
oh
there
you
are
you
two
sister
you
go
and
stand
back
of
that
crowd
around
the
faro
table
keep
craning
to
look
over
their
shoulders
and
give
us
your
side
view
i
want
to
use
this
man
alone
he
led
merton
to
a
round
table
on
which
were
a
deck
of
cards
and
some
neatly
stacked
chips
sit
here
facing
the
camera
keep
one
hand
on
the
cards
sort
of
toying
with
em
see
what
i
mean
he
scattered
the
piled
chips
loosely
about
the
table
and
called
to
a
black
waiter
here
george
put
one
of
those
wine
glasses
on
his
the
wine
glass
was
placed
now
kind
of
slump
down
in
your
chair
like
you
saw
the
hollowness
of
it
all
see
what
i
mean
merton
gill
thought
he
saw
he
exhaled
smoke
toyed
contemptuously
with
the
cards
at
his
right
hand
and
with
a
gesture
of
repulsion
pushed
the
wine
glass
farther
away
he
saw
the
hollowness
of
it
all
the
spirit
of
wine
sang
in
his
glass
but
to
deaf
ears
chance
could
no
longer
entice
him
it
might
again
have
been
suspected
that
cigarettes
were
ceasing
to
allure
good
work
keep
it
up
said
henshaw
and
went
back
to
his
cameras
the
lights
jarred
on
desperate
gaming
was
filmed
more
life
at
the
roulette
tables
megaphoned
henshaw
crowd
closer
around
that
faro
table
you
re
playing
for
big
the
gaming
became
more
feverish
the
mad
light
of
pleasure
was
in
every
eye
yet
one
felt
that
the
blight
of
broadway
was
real
the
camera
was
wheeled
forward
and
merton
gill
joyously
quit
smoking
while
henshaw
secured
flashes
of
various
groups
chiefly
of
losers
who
were
seeing
the
hollowness
of
it
all
he
did
not
however
disdain
a
bit
of
comedy
miss
yes
the
montague
girl
paused
in
the
act
of
sprinkling
chips
over
a
roulette
your
escort
has
lost
all
his
chips
and
you
ve
lost
all
he
bought
for
you
the
girl
and
her
escort
passed
to
other
players
the
chips
before
them
and
waited
your
escort
takes
out
his
wallet
shows
it
to
you
empty
and
shrugs
his
shoulders
you
shrug
too
but
turn
your
back
on
him
facing
the
camera
and
take
some
bills
out
of
your
stocking
see
what
i
mean
give
her
some
bills
never
mind
henshaw
i
already
got
some
the
pantomime
was
done
the
girl
turned
stooped
withdrew
flattened
bills
from
one
of
the
stockings
and
flourished
them
at
her
escort
who
achieved
a
transition
from
gloom
to
joy
merton
gill
observing
this
shameless
procedure
plumbed
the
nether
depths
of
disgust
for
broadway
s
night
life
the
camera
was
now
wheeled
toward
him
and
he
wearily
lighted
another
cigarette
get
a
flash
of
this
chap
henshaw
was
saying
the
subject
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
gazing
with
cynical
eyes
at
the
fevered
throng
wine
women
song
all
had
palled
gambling
had
no
charm
he
looked
with
disrelish
at
the
cigarette
he
had
but
just
lighted
all
right
paul
that
s
good
now
get
that
bunch
over
at
the
crap
merton
gill
lost
no
time
in
relinquishing
his
cigarette
he
dropped
it
into
the
wine
glass
which
became
a
symbol
of
broadway
s
fruit
thereafter
he
smoked
only
when
he
was
in
the
picture
he
felt
that
he
was
becoming
screen
wise
and
henshaw
had
remembered
him
the
cast
of
the
blight
of
broadway
might
not
be
jewelled
with
his
name
but
his
work
would
stand
out
he
had
given
the
best
that
was
in
him
he
watched
the
entrance
of
muriel
mercer
maddest
of
all
the
mad
throng
accompanied
by
the
two
young
men
and
the
girl
who
was
not
so
beautiful
he
watched
her
lose
steadily
and
saw
her
string
of
pearls
saved
by
the
elderly
scoundrel
who
had
long
watched
the
beautiful
girl
as
only
the
wolf
of
wall
street
could
watch
one
so
fair
he
saw
her
leave
upon
his
arm
perhaps
for
further
unwholesome
adventure
along
broadway
the
lights
were
out
the
revelry
done
merton
gill
beyond
a
doubt
preferred
western
stuff
some
tale
of
the
open
spaces
or
perhaps
of
the
frozen
north
where
he
could
be
the
and
not
have
to
smoke
so
many
cigarettes
only
one
now
and
then
which
he
would
roll
himself
and
toss
away
after
a
few
puffs
still
he
had
shown
above
the
mob
of
extra
people
he
thought
henshaw
had
noticed
him
he
was
coming
on
the
montague
girl
hailed
him
as
he
left
the
set
hullo
old
trouper
i
caught
you
actin
again
right
out
before
the
white
folks
well
so
far
so
good
but
say
i
m
glad
all
that
roulette
and
stuff
was
for
the
stage
and
not
on
the
level
i
d
certainly
have
lost
everything
but
my
so
long
kid
she
danced
off
to
join
a
group
of
other
women
who
were
leaving
he
felt
a
kindly
pity
for
the
child
there
could
be
little
future
in
this
difficult
art
for
one
who
took
it
so
lightly
who
talked
so
frankly
to
strangers
without
being
introduced
at
luncheon
in
the
cafeteria
he
waited
a
long
time
in
the
hope
of
encountering
henshaw
who
would
perhaps
command
his
further
services
in
the
cause
of
creative
screen
art
he
meant
to
be
animated
at
this
meeting
to
show
the
director
that
he
could
be
something
more
than
an
actor
who
had
probed
the
shams
of
broadway
but
he
lingered
in
vain
he
thought
henshaw
would
perhaps
be
doing
without
food
in
order
to
work
on
the
scenario
for
robinson
crusoe
junior
he
again
stopped
to
thank
his
friend
the
casting
director
for
securing
him
his
first
chance
she
accepted
his
thanks
smilingly
and
asked
him
to
drop
around
often
mind
you
don
t
forget
our
number
she
said
he
was
on
the
point
of
making
her
understand
once
for
all
that
he
would
not
forget
the
number
that
he
would
never
forget
gashwiler
s
address
that
he
had
been
coming
to
this
studio
too
often
to
forget
its
location
but
someone
engaged
her
at
the
window
so
he
was
obliged
to
go
on
without
enlightening
the
woman
she
seemed
to
be
curiously
dense
chapter
vii
nothing
dear
the
savings
had
been
opportunely
replenished
in
two
days
he
had
accumulated
a
sum
for
which
back
in
simsbury
he
would
have
had
to
toil
a
week
yet
there
was
to
be
said
in
favour
of
the
simsbury
position
that
it
steadily
endured
each
week
brought
its
fifteen
dollars
pittance
though
it
might
be
while
the
art
of
the
silver
screen
was
capricious
in
its
rewards
not
to
say
jumpy
never
for
weeks
at
a
stretch
had
gashwiler
said
with
a
tired
smile
nothing
sorry
he
might
have
been
a
grouch
and
given
to
unreasonable
nagging
but
with
him
there
was
always
a
very
definite
something
which
he
would
specify
in
short
words
if
the
occasion
seemed
to
demand
there
was
not
only
a
definite
something
every
day
but
a
definite
if
not
considerable
sum
of
money
to
be
paid
over
every
saturday
night
and
in
the
meantime
three
very
definite
and
quite
satisfying
meals
to
be
freely
partaken
of
at
stated
hours
each
day
the
leisure
enforced
by
truly
creative
screen
art
was
often
occupied
now
with
really
moving
pictures
of
metta
judson
placing
practicable
food
upon
the
gashwiler
table
this
had
been
no
table
in
a
gilded
broadway
resort
holding
empty
coffee
cups
and
half
empty
wine
glasses
passed
and
repassed
by
apparently
busy
waiters
with
laden
trays
who
never
left
anything
of
a
practicable
nature
doubtless
the
set
would
not
have
appealed
to
henshaw
he
would
never
have
been
moved
to
take
even
for
mere
flashes
of
those
who
ate
this
food
and
yet
more
and
more
as
the
days
went
by
this
film
would
unreel
itself
before
the
eager
eyes
of
merton
gill
often
now
it
thrilled
him
as
might
have
an
installment
of
the
hazards
of
hortense
for
the
food
of
his
favourite
pharmacy
was
beginning
to
pall
and
metta
judson
though
giving
her
shallow
mind
to
base
village
gossip
was
a
good
cook
she
became
the
adored
heroine
of
an
apparently
endless
serial
to
be
entitled
the
hazards
of
clifford
armytage
in
which
the
hero
had
tragically
little
to
do
but
sit
upon
a
bench
and
wait
while
tempting
repasts
were
served
sometimes
on
the
little
bench
around
the
eucalyptus
tree
he
would
run
an
entire
program
feature
beginning
with
the
sunday
midday
dinner
of
roast
chicken
and
abounding
in
tense
dramatic
moments
such
as
and
cabbage
on
tuesday
night
and
hash
on
wednesday
morning
he
would
pause
to
take
superb
closeups
of
these
the
corned
beef
on
its
spreading
platter
hemmed
about
with
boiled
potatoes
and
turnips
and
cabbage
and
the
corned
beef
hash
with
its
richly
browned
surface
the
thrilling
climax
would
be
the
roast
of
beef
on
saturday
night
with
taken
in
the
very
eye
of
the
camera
of
the
mashed
potatoes
and
the
apple
pie
drenched
with
cream
and
there
were
of
metta
judson
who
had
never
seriously
contemplated
a
screen
career
placing
upon
the
table
a
tower
of
steaming
hot
cakes
while
a
platter
of
small
sausages
loomed
eloquently
in
the
foreground
with
eyes
closed
he
would
run
this
film
again
and
again
cutting
here
rearranging
sequences
adding
trims
from
suddenly
remembered
meals
of
the
dead
past
devising
more
intimate
such
as
the
one
of
metta
withdrawing
pies
from
the
oven
or
smoothing
hot
chocolate
caressingly
over
the
top
of
a
giant
cake
or
broiling
chops
or
saying
in
a
subtitle
artistically
decorated
with
cooked
foods
how
about
some
hot
coffee
merton
he
became
an
able
producer
of
this
drama
he
devised
a
hundred
sympathetic
little
touches
that
henshaw
would
probably
never
have
thought
of
he
used
footage
on
a
mere
platter
of
steak
that
another
director
might
have
ignored
utterly
he
made
it
gripping
the
supreme
drama
of
his
season
a
big
thing
done
in
a
big
way
and
yet
not
even
the
censors
of
the
great
state
of
pennsylvania
could
have
outlawed
its
realism
brutal
though
this
was
in
such
great
moments
as
when
gashwiler
carved
the
roast
beef
so
able
was
his
artistry
that
merton
s
nostrils
would
sometimes
betray
him
he
could
swear
they
caught
rich
aromas
from
that
distant
board
not
only
had
the
fare
purveyed
by
his
favourite
pharmacy
put
a
blight
upon
him
equal
to
broadway
s
blight
but
even
of
this
tasteless
stuff
he
must
be
cautious
in
his
buying
a
sandwich
not
too
meaty
at
the
centre
coffee
tasting
strangely
of
other
things
sold
in
a
pharmacy
a
segment
of
pie
fair
seeming
on
its
surface
but
lacking
the
punch
as
he
put
it
of
metta
judson
s
pie
a
standardized
altogether
formal
and
perfunctory
pie
these
were
the
meagre
items
of
his
accustomed
luncheon
and
dinner
he
had
abandoned
breakfast
partly
because
it
cost
money
and
partly
because
a
gentleman
in
eastern
ohio
had
recently
celebrated
his
hundred
and
third
birthday
by
reason
so
he
confided
to
the
press
of
having
always
breakfasted
upon
a
glass
of
clear
cold
water
probably
ham
and
eggs
or
corned
beef
hash
would
have
cut
him
off
at
ninety
and
water
from
the
tap
in
the
patterson
kitchen
was
both
clear
and
cold
it
was
not
so
much
that
he
cared
to
live
beyond
ninety
or
so
but
he
wished
to
survive
until
things
began
to
pick
up
on
the
holden
lot
and
if
this
did
bring
him
many
more
years
well
and
good
further
if
the
woman
in
the
casting
office
persisted
as
she
had
for
ten
days
in
saying
nothing
yet
to
inquiring
screen
artists
he
might
be
compelled
to
intensify
the
regime
of
the
ohio
centenarian
perhaps
a
glass
of
clear
cold
water
at
night
after
a
hearty
midday
meal
of
drug
store
sandwiches
and
pie
would
work
new
wonders
it
seemed
to
be
the
present
opinion
of
other
waiters
on
the
extra
bench
that
things
were
never
going
to
pick
up
on
the
holden
lot
nor
on
any
other
lot
strongly
marked
types
ready
to
add
distinction
to
the
screen
of
painted
shadows
freely
expressed
a
view
that
the
business
was
on
the
rocks
unaffected
by
the
optimists
who
wrote
in
the
picture
magazines
they
saw
no
future
for
it
more
than
one
of
them
threatened
to
desert
the
industry
and
return
to
previous
callings
as
they
were
likely
to
put
it
they
were
going
to
leave
the
pictures
flat
and
go
back
to
or
selling
standard
or
waiting
on
table
or
something
where
you
could
count
on
your
little
bit
every
week
under
the
eucalyptus
tree
one
morning
merton
gill
making
some
appetizing
changes
in
the
fifth
reel
of
eating
at
gashwiler
s
was
accosted
by
a
youngish
woman
whom
he
could
not
at
first
recall
she
had
come
from
the
casting
office
and
paused
when
she
saw
him
hello
i
thought
it
was
you
but
i
wasn
t
sure
in
them
clothes
how
they
coming
he
stared
blankly
startled
at
the
sudden
transposition
he
had
been
compelled
to
make
for
the
gleaming
knife
of
gashwiler
standing
up
to
carve
had
just
then
hovered
above
the
roast
of
beef
then
he
placed
the
speaker
by
reason
of
her
eyes
it
was
the
spanish
girl
his
companion
of
the
gilded
cabaret
later
encountered
in
the
palatial
gambling
hell
that
ate
like
a
cancer
at
the
heart
of
new
york
probably
at
the
corner
of
broadway
and
fifth
avenue
he
arose
and
shook
hands
cordially
he
had
supposed
when
he
thought
of
the
girl
at
all
that
she
would
always
be
rather
spanish
an
exotic
creature
rather
garishly
dressed
nervously
eager
craving
excitement
such
as
may
be
had
in
cabarets
on
broadway
with
a
marked
inclination
for
the
lighter
life
of
pleasure
but
she
wore
not
so
much
as
a
rose
in
her
smoothly
combed
hair
she
was
not
only
not
excited
but
she
was
not
exciting
she
was
plainly
dressed
in
skirt
and
shirtwaist
of
no
distinction
her
was
of
the
most
ordinary
and
well
worn
and
her
face
under
a
hat
of
no
allure
was
without
a
commonplace
somewhat
anxious
face
with
lines
about
the
eyes
but
her
voice
as
well
as
her
eyes
helped
him
to
recall
her
she
spoke
with
an
effort
at
jauntiness
after
merton
had
greeted
her
that
s
one
great
slogan
business
as
usual
ain
t
it
well
it
s
business
as
usual
here
so
i
just
found
out
from
the
countess
as
usual
rotten
i
ain
t
had
but
three
days
since
i
seen
you
i
haven
t
had
even
one
he
told
her
no
say
that
s
tough
you
re
registered
with
the
service
bureau
ain
t
you
well
i
didn
t
do
that
because
they
might
send
me
any
place
and
i
sort
of
wanted
to
work
on
this
particular
instantly
he
saw
himself
saving
beulah
baxter
for
the
next
installment
from
a
fate
worse
than
death
but
the
spanish
girl
did
not
share
this
vision
oh
well
little
i
care
where
i
work
i
had
two
days
at
the
bigart
in
a
scene
and
one
over
at
the
united
doin
some
stuff
i
could
a
had
another
day
there
but
the
director
said
i
wasn
t
just
the
type
for
a
chick
he
was
very
nice
about
it
of
course
i
know
my
legs
ain
t
the
best
part
of
me
i
sure
ain
t
one
of
them
like
the
girl
that
says
she
s
wasted
in
she
grinned
ruefully
he
felt
that
some
expression
of
sympathy
would
be
graceful
here
yet
he
divined
that
it
must
be
very
discreetly
almost
delicately
worded
he
could
easily
be
too
blunt
i
guess
i
d
be
pretty
skinny
in
a
myself
right
now
i
know
they
won
t
be
giving
me
any
such
part
pretty
soon
if
i
have
to
cut
down
on
the
meals
the
way
i
been
oh
of
course

said
merton

struggling
against
the
obsession
of
dinner
at
gashwiler
s
grimly
he
resumed
his
seat
when
the
girl
with
a
friendly
so
long
had
trudged
on
in
spite
of
himself
he
found
something
base
in
his
nature
picturing
his
return
to
the
emporium
and
to
the
encounter
with
metta
judson
s
cookery
he
let
his
lower
instincts
toy
with
the
unworthy
vision
gashwiler
would
advance
him
the
money
to
return
and
the
job
would
be
there
probably
spencer
grant
had
before
this
tired
of
the
work
and
gone
into
insurance
or
some
other
line
and
probably
gashwiler
would
be
only
too
glad
to
have
the
wanderer
back
he
would
get
off
no
just
in
time
for
breakfast
he
brushed
the
monstrous
scene
from
his
eyes
shrugged
it
from
his
shoulders
he
would
not
give
up
they
had
all
struggled
and
sacrificed
and
why
should
he
shrink
from
the
common
ordeal
but
he
wished
the
spanish
girl
hadn
t
talked
about
going
back
to
her
job
he
regretted
not
having
stopped
her
with
words
of
confident
cheer
that
would
have
stiffened
his
own
resolution
he
could
see
her
far
down
the
street
on
her
way
to
the
next
lot
her
narrow
shoulders
switching
from
light
to
shadow
as
she
trudged
under
the
line
of
eucalyptus
trees
he
hoped
she
wouldn
t
give
up
no
one
should
ever
give
up
least
of
all
merton
gill
the
days
wore
wearily
on
he
began
to
feel
on
his
own
face
the
tired
little
smile
of
the
woman
in
the
casting
office
as
she
would
look
up
to
shake
her
head
often
from
the
telephone
over
which
she
was
saying
nothing
dear
sorry
she
didn
t
exactly
feel
that
the
business
had
gone
on
the
rocks
but
she
knew
it
wasn
t
picking
up
as
it
should
and
ever
and
again
she
would
have
merton
gill
assure
her
that
he
hadn
t
forgotten
the
home
address
the
town
where
lived
gighampton
or
gumwash
or
whoever
it
was
that
held
the
good
old
job
open
for
him
he
had
divined
that
it
was
a
jest
of
some
sort
when
she
warned
him
not
to
forget
the
address
and
he
would
patiently
smile
at
this
but
he
always
put
her
right
about
the
name
of
gashwiler
of
course
it
was
a
name
any
one
might
forget
though
the
woman
always
seemed
to
make
the
most
earnest
effort
to
remember
it
each
day
after
his
brief
chat
with
her
in
which
he
learned
that
there
would
be
nothing
he
would
sit
on
the
bench
or
out
under
the
eucalyptus
tree
and
consecrate
himself
anew
to
the
art
of
the
perpendicular
screen
and
each
day
as
the
little
hoard
was
diminished
by
even
those
slender
repasts
at
the
drug
store
he
ran
his
film
of
the
gashwiler
dining
room
in
action
from
time
to
time
he
would
see
the
montague
girl
alone
or
with
her
mother
entering
the
casting
office
or
perhaps
issuing
from
the
guarded
gate
he
avoided
her
when
possible
she
persisted
in
behaving
as
if
they
had
been
properly
introduced
and
had
known
each
other
a
long
time
she
was
too
familiar
and
her
levity
jarred
upon
his
more
serious
mood
so
far
as
he
could
see
the
girl
had
no
screen
future
though
doubtless
she
was
her
own
worst
enemy
if
someone
had
only
taught
her
to
be
serious
her
career
might
have
been
worth
while
she
had
seemed
not
wholly
negligible
in
the
dancing
frock
though
of
course
the
blonde
curls
had
not
been
true
then
the
days
passed
until
eating
merely
at
a
lunch
counter
became
not
the
only
matter
of
concern
there
was
the
item
of
room
rent
patterson
the
los
angeles
society
woman
had
upon
the
occasion
of
their
first
interview
made
it
all
too
clear
that
the
money
trifling
though
it
must
seem
for
a
room
with
the
privilege
of
electric
iron
in
the
kitchen
must
be
paid
each
week
in
advance
strictly
in
advance
her
eye
had
held
a
cold
light
as
she
dwelt
upon
this
there
had
been
times
lately
when
upon
his
tree
bench
he
would
try
to
dramatize
patterson
as
a
woman
with
a
soft
heart
under
that
polished
society
exterior
chilled
by
daily
contact
with
other
society
people
at
the
iowa
or
kansas
or
other
society
picnics
yet
ready
to
melt
at
the
true
human
touch
but
he
had
never
quite
succeeded
in
this
bit
of
character
work
something
told
him
that
she
was
cold
all
through
a
society
woman
without
a
flaw
in
her
armour
he
could
not
make
her
seem
to
listen
patiently
while
he
explained
that
only
one
company
was
now
shooting
on
the
lot
but
that
big
things
were
expected
to
be
on
in
another
week
or
so
a
certain
skeptic
hardness
was
in
her
gaze
as
he
visioned
it
he
decided
indeed
that
he
could
never
bring
himself
even
to
attempt
this
scene
with
the
woman
so
remote
was
he
from
seeing
her
eye
soften
and
her
voice
warm
with
the
assurance
that
a
few
weeks
more
or
less
need
not
matter
the
room
rent
he
was
confident
would
have
to
be
paid
strictly
in
advance
so
long
as
their
relations
continued
she
was
the
kind
who
would
insist
upon
this
formality
even
after
he
began
to
play
at
an
enormous
salary
a
certain
outstanding
part
in
the
hazards
of
hortense
the
exigencies
even
the
adversities
of
art
would
never
make
the
slightest
appeal
to
this
hardened
soul
so
much
for
that
and
daily
the
hoard
waned
yet
his
was
not
the
only
tragedy
in
the
waiting
room
where
he
now
spent
more
of
his
time
he
listened
one
day
to
the
montague
girl
chat
through
the
window
with
the
woman
she
called
countess
yeah
pa
was
over
at
the
bigart
he
raised
that
lovely
set
of
whiskers
for
camillia
of
the
cumberlands
and
what
did
he
get
for
it
just
two
weeks
fact
what
do
you
know
about
that
hugo
has
him
killed
off
in
the
second
spool
with
a
squirrel
rifle
from
ambush
and
pa
thinking
he
would
draw
pay
for
at
least
another
three
weeks
he
kicked
but
hugo
says
the
plot
demanded
it
i
bet
at
that
he
was
just
trying
to
cut
down
his
salary
list
i
bet
that
continuity
this
minute
shows
pa
drinking
his
corn
out
of
a
jug
and
playing
a
fiddle
for
the
dance
right
down
to
the
last
scene
don
t
artists
get
the
razz
though
and
that
hugo
he
d
spend
a
week
in
the
hot
place
to
save
a
thin
dime
let
me
tell
you
countess
don
t
you
ever
get
your
lemon
in
his
there
were
audible
murmurs
of
sympathy
from
the
countess
and
so
the
old
trouper
had
to
start
out
monday
morning
to
peddle
the
brush
took
him
three
days
to
land
anything
at
all
and
then
it
s
nothing
but
a
sleeping
souse
in
a
western
scene
in
here
now
he
is
something
the
acme
people
are
doing
he
s
had
three
days
just
lying
down
with
his
back
against
a
barrel
sleeping
he
s
not
to
wake
up
even
when
the
fight
starts
but
sleep
right
on
through
it
which
they
say
will
be
a
good
gag
well
maybe
but
it
s
tough
on
his
home
he
gets
all
his
rest
daytimes
and
keeps
us
restless
all
night
making
a
new
kind
of
beer
and
tending
his
still
and
so
on
you
bet
ma
and
i
the
minute
he
s
through
with
this
piece
are
going
pronto
to
get
that
face
of
his
as
naked
as
the
day
he
was
born
pa
s
so
temperamental
like
that
time
he
was
playing
a
bishop
and
never
touched
a
drop
for
five
weeks
and
in
bed
every
night
at
me
oh
i
m
having
a
bit
of
my
own
in
this
acme
piece
god
s
great
outdoors
i
think
it
is
anyway
i
m
to
be
a
little
blonde
hussy
in
the
sitting
on
the
miners
knees
and
all
like
that
so
they
ll
order
more
drinks
it
certainly
takes
all
kinds
of
art
to
make
an
artist
and
next
week
i
got
some
shipwreck
stuff
for
baxter
and
me
with
bronchial
pneumonia
right
this
minute
and
hating
tank
stuff
anyway
well
countess
don
t
take
any
counterfeit
money
so
she
danced
through
a
doorway
and
was
gone
she
was
one
who
seldom
descended
to
plain
walking
she
would
manage
a
dance
step
even
in
the
short
distance
from
the
casting
office
door
to
the
window
it
was
not
of
such
material
merton
gill
was
sure
that
creative
artists
were
moulded
and
there
was
no
question
now
of
his
own
utter
seriousness
the
situation
hourly
grew
more
desperate
for
a
week
he
had
foregone
the
pie
so
that
now
he
recalled
it
as
very
wonderful
pie
indeed
but
he
dared
no
longer
indulge
in
this
luxury
an
occasional
small
bag
of
candy
and
as
much
sugar
as
he
could
juggle
into
his
coffee
must
satisfy
his
craving
for
sweets
stoically
he
awaited
the
end
some
end
the
business
seemed
to
be
still
on
the
rocks
but
things
must
take
a
turn
he
went
over
the
talk
of
the
montague
girl
her
father
had
perhaps
been
unfairly
treated
but
at
least
he
was
working
again
and
there
were
other
actors
who
would
go
unshaven
for
even
a
sleeping
part
in
the
scene
of
god
s
great
outdoors
merton
gill
knew
one
and
rubbed
his
shaven
chin
he
thought
too
of
the
girl
s
warning
about
counterfeit
money
he
had
not
known
that
the
casting
director
s
duties
required
her
to
handle
money
but
probably
he
had
overlooked
this
item
in
her
routine
and
was
counterfeit
money
about
he
drew
out
his
own
remaining
bill
and
scrutinized
it
anxiously
it
seemed
to
be
genuine
he
hoped
it
was
for
patterson
s
sake
and
was
relieved
when
she
accepted
it
without
question
that
night
later
he
tested
the
handful
of
silver
that
remained
to
him
and
prayed
earnestly
that
an
increase
of
prosperity
be
granted
to
producers
of
the
motion
picture
with
the
silver
he
eked
out
another
barren
week
only
to
face
a
day
the
evening
of
which
must
witness
another
fiscal
transaction
with
patterson
and
there
was
no
longer
a
bill
for
this
heartless
society
creature
he
took
a
long
look
at
the
pleasant
little
room
as
he
left
it
that
morning
the
day
must
bring
something
but
it
might
not
bring
him
back
that
night
at
the
drug
store
he
purchased
a
bowl
of
vegetable
soup
loaded
it
heavily
with
catsup
at
intervals
when
the
attendant
had
other
matters
on
his
mind
and
seized
an
extra
half
portion
of
crackers
left
on
their
plate
by
a
satiated
neighbour
he
cared
little
for
catsup
but
it
doubtless
bore
nourishing
elements
and
nourishment
was
now
important
he
crumpled
his
paper
napkin
and
laid
upon
the
marble
slab
a
trifling
silver
coin
it
was
the
last
of
his
hoard
when
he
should
eat
next
and
under
what
circumstances
were
now
as
uncertain
as
where
he
should
sleep
that
night
though
he
was
already
resolving
that
catsup
would
be
no
part
of
his
meal
it
might
be
well
enough
in
its
place
but
he
had
abundantly
proved
that
it
was
not
strictly
speaking
a
food
he
reached
the
holden
studios
and
loitered
outside
for
half
an
hour
before
daring
the
daily
inquiry
at
the
window
yet
when
at
last
he
did
approach
it
his
waning
faith
in
prayer
was
renewed
for
here
in
his
direst
hour
was
cheering
news
it
seemed
even
that
his
friend
beyond
the
window
had
been
impatient
at
his
coming
just
like
you
to
be
late
when
there
s
something
doing
she
called
to
him
with
friendly
impatience
get
over
to
the
dressing
rooms
on
the
it
s
the
victor
people
doing
some
egyptian
stuff
they
ll
give
you
a
costume
hurry
along
and
he
had
lingered
over
a
bowl
of
soggy
crackers
soaked
at
the
last
chiefly
in
catsup
he
hurried
with
a
swift
word
of
thanks
in
the
same
dressing
room
where
he
had
once
been
made
up
as
a
broadway
pleasure
seeker
he
now
donned
the
flowing
robe
and
burnoose
of
a
bedouin
and
by
the
same
grumbling
extra
his
face
and
hands
were
stained
the
rich
brown
of
children
of
the
desert
a
dozen
other
men
of
the
paler
race
had
undergone
the
same
treatment
a
sheik
of
great
stature
and
noble
mien
smoked
an
idle
cigarette
in
the
doorway
he
was
accoutred
with
musket
and
with
pistols
in
his
belt
an
assistant
director
presently
herded
the
desert
men
down
an
alley
between
two
of
the
big
stages
and
to
the
beginning
of
the
oriental
street
that
merton
had
noticed
on
his
first
day
within
the
holden
walls
it
was
now
peopled
picturesquely
with
other
bedouins
banners
hung
from
the
walls
and
veiled
ladies
peeped
from
the
latticed
balconies
a
camel
was
led
excitingly
through
the
crowded
way
and
donkeys
and
goats
were
to
be
observed
it
was
a
noisy
street
until
a
whistle
sounded
at
the
farther
end
then
all
was
silence
while
the
voice
of
henshaw
came
through
the
megaphone
it
appeared
that
long
shots
of
the
street
were
henshaw
s
first
need
up
and
down
it
merton
gill
strolled
in
a
negligent
manner
stopping
perhaps
to
haggle
with
the
vendor
who
sold
sweetmeats
from
a
tray
or
to
chat
with
a
tribal
brother
fresh
from
the
sandy
wastes
or
to
purchase
a
glass
of
milk
from
the
man
with
the
goats
he
secured
a
rose
from
the
flower
seller
and
had
the
inspiration
to
toss
it
to
one
of
the
discreet
balconies
above
him
but
as
he
stepped
back
to
do
this
he
was
stopped
by
the
watchful
assistant
director
who
stood
just
inside
a
doorway
hey
bill
none
of
that
keep
your
head
down
and
pay
no
attention
to
the
dames
it
ain
t
he
strolled
on
with
the
rose
in
his
hand
later
and
much
nearer
the
end
of
the
street
where
the
cameras
were
he
saw
the
sheik
of
noble
mien
halt
the
flower
seller
haggle
for
another
rose
place
this
daintily
behind
his
left
ear
and
stalk
on
his
musket
held
over
one
shoulder
his
other
hand
on
a
belted
pistol
merton
disposed
of
his
rose
in
the
same
manner
he
admired
the
sheik
for
his
stature
his
majestic
carriage
his
dark
handsome
yet
sinister
face
with
its
brooding
eyes
he
thought
this
man
at
least
would
be
a
true
arab
some
real
son
of
the
desert
who
had
wandered
afar
his
manner
was
so
much
more
authentic
than
that
of
the
extra
people
all
about
a
whistle
blew
and
the
street
action
was
suspended
there
was
a
long
wait
while
cameras
were
moved
up
and
groups
formed
under
the
direction
of
henshaw
and
his
assistant
a
band
of
bedouins
were
now
to
worship
in
the
porch
of
a
mosque
merton
gill
was
among
these
the
assistant
director
initiated
them
briefly
into
moslem
rites
upon
prayer
rugs
they
bowed
their
foreheads
to
earth
in
the
direction
of
mecca
what
s
the
idea
of
this
here
demanded
merton
gill
s
neighbour
in
aggrieved
tones
ssh
cautioned
merton
it
s
mass
or
something
like
and
they
bent
in
unison
to
this
devotion
when
this
was
done
henshaw
bustled
into
the
group
i
want
about
a
dozen
or
fifteen
good
types
for
the
cafe
he
explained
to
his
assistant
merton
gill
instinctively
stood
forward
and
was
presently
among
those
selected
you
ll
do
said
henshaw
nodding
the
director
of
course
had
not
remembered
that
this
was
the
actor
he
had
distinguished
in
the
blight
of
broadway
yet
he
had
again
chosen
him
for
eminence
it
showed
merton
felt
that
his
conviction
about
the
screen
value
of
his
face
was
not
ill
founded
the
selected
types
were
now
herded
into
a
dark
narrow
room
with
a
divan
effect
along
its
three
walls
a
grizzled
arab
made
coffee
over
a
glowing
brazier
merton
gill
sat
on
the
divan
and
became
fearful
that
he
would
be
asked
to
smoke
the
narghileh
which
the
assistant
director
was
now
preparing
to
one
who
balked
at
mere
cigarettes
it
was
an
device
his
neighbour
who
had
been
puzzled
at
now
hitched
up
his
flowing
robe
to
withdraw
a
paper
of
cigarettes
from
the
pocket
of
a
quite
occidental
garment
go
on
smoke
cigarettes
said
the
assistant
director
have
one
said
merton
s
neighbour
and
he
took
one
it
seemed
you
couldn
t
get
away
from
cigarettes
on
the
screen
east
and
west
were
here
one
he
lighted
it
though
smoking
warily
the
noble
sheik
of
undoubtedly
asiatic
origin
came
to
the
doorway
overlooking
the
assistant
director
s
work
on
the
narghileh
a
laden
camel
halted
near
him
sneered
in
an
evil
manner
at
the
bystanders
and
then
lifting
an
incredible
length
of
upper
lip
set
his
yellow
teeth
in
the
nearest
shoulder
it
was
the
shoulder
of
the
noble
sheik
who
instantly
rent
the
air
with
a
plaintive
cry
for
the
love
of
mike
keep
that
off
n
me
can
t
you
his
accent
had
not
been
that
of
the
arabian
merton
gill
was
disappointed
so
the
fellow
was
only
an
actor
after
all
if
he
had
felt
sympathy
at
all
it
would
now
have
been
for
the
camel
the
beast
was
jerked
back
with
profane
words
and
the
sheik
rubbing
his
bitten
shoulder
entered
the
cafe
sitting
at
the
end
of
the
divan
nearest
the
door
all
right
the
assistant
director
handed
him
the
tube
of
the
water
pipe
and
the
sheik
smoked
with
every
sign
of
enjoyment
merton
gill
resolved
never
to
play
the
part
of
an
arab
sheik
at
the
mercy
of
camels
and
having
to
smoke
something
that
looked
murderous
under
henshaw
s
direction
the
grizzled
proprietor
now
served
tiny
cups
of
coffee
to
the
sheik
and
his
lesser
patrons
two
of
these
played
dominoes
and
one
or
two
reclined
as
in
sleep
cameras
were
brought
up
the
interior
being
to
his
satisfaction
henshaw
rehearsed
the
entrance
of
a
little
band
of
european
tourists
a
beautiful
girl
in
sports
garb
a
beautiful
young
man
in
khaki
and
puttees
a
fine
old
british
father
with
gray
side
whiskers
shaded
by
a
with
a
flowing
veil
twined
about
it
these
people
sat
and
were
served
coffee
staring
in
a
tourist
manner
at
their
novel
surroundings
the
bedouins
under
stern
command
ignored
them
conversing
among
themselves
over
their
coffee
all
but
the
sheik
the
sheik
had
been
instantly
struck
by
the
fair
young
english
girl
his
sinister
eyes
hung
constantly
upon
her
shifting
only
when
she
regarded
him
furtively
returning
when
she
ceased
when
they
left
the
cafe
the
sheik
arose
and
placed
himself
partly
in
the
girl
s
way
she
paused
while
his
dark
eyes
caught
and
held
hers
a
long
moment
went
before
she
seemed
able
to
free
herself
from
the
hypnotic
tension
he
put
upon
her
then
he
bowed
low
and
the
girl
with
a
nervous
laugh
passed
him
it
could
be
seen
that
the
sheik
meant
her
no
good
he
stepped
to
the
door
and
looked
after
the
group
there
was
evil
purpose
in
his
gaze
merton
gill
recalled
something
of
henshaw
s
words
the
first
day
he
had
eaten
at
the
cafeteria
they
find
this
deserted
tomb
just
at
nightfall
and
he
s
alone
there
with
the
girl
and
he
could
do
anything
but
the
kick
for
the
audience
is
that
he
s
a
gentleman
and
never
lays
a
finger
on
this
would
be
the
story
probably
the
sheik
would
now
arrange
with
the
old
gentleman
in
the
to
guide
the
party
over
the
desert
and
would
betray
them
in
order
to
get
the
beautiful
girl
into
his
power
of
course
there
would
be
a
kick
for
the
audience
when
the
young
fellow
proved
to
be
a
gentleman
in
the
deserted
tomb
for
a
whole
night
any
audience
would
expect
him
under
these
propitious
circumstances
to
be
quite
otherwise
if
the
girl
were
as
beautiful
as
this
one
but
there
would
surely
be
a
greater
kick
when
the
sheik
found
them
in
the
tomb
and
bore
the
girl
off
on
his
camel
after
a
fight
in
which
the
gentleman
was
momentarily
worsted
but
the
girl
would
be
rescued
in
time
and
probably
the
piece
would
be
called
desert
passion
he
wished
he
could
know
the
ending
of
the
story
indeed
he
sincerely
wished
he
could
work
in
it
to
the
end
not
alone
because
he
was
curious
about
the
fate
of
the
young
girl
in
the
bad
sheik
s
power
undoubtedly
the
sheik
would
not
prove
to
be
a
gentleman
but
merton
would
like
to
work
to
the
end
of
the
story
because
he
had
no
place
to
sleep
and
but
little
assurance
of
wholesome
food
yet
this
it
appeared
was
not
to
be
already
word
had
run
among
the
extra
people
those
hired
were
to
be
used
for
only
tomorrow
the
desert
drama
would
unfold
without
them
still
he
had
a
day
s
pay
coming
this
time
though
it
would
be
but
five
dollars
his
dress
suit
had
not
been
needed
and
five
dollars
would
appease
patterson
for
another
week
yet
what
would
be
the
good
of
sleeping
if
he
had
nothing
to
eat
he
was
hungry
now
thin
soup
ever
so
plenteously
spiced
with
catsup
was
inadequate
provender
for
a
working
artist
he
knew
even
as
he
sat
there
an
apparently
and
bedouin
that
this
ensuing
five
dollars
would
never
be
seen
by
patterson
there
were
a
few
more
shots
of
the
cafe
s
interior
during
which
one
of
the
inmates
carefully
permitted
his
half
consumed
cigarette
to
go
out
after
that
a
few
more
shots
of
the
lively
street
which
it
was
now
learned
was
a
street
in
cairo
earnest
efforts
were
made
by
the
throngs
in
these
scenes
to
give
the
murderous
camel
plenty
of
head
room
some
were
taken
of
the
european
tourists
while
they
bargained
with
a
native
merchant
for
hammered
brassware
and
rare
shawls
the
bad
sheik
was
caught
near
the
group
bending
an
evil
glare
upon
the
beauteous
english
girl
and
once
the
camera
turned
while
she
faced
him
with
a
little
shiver
of
apprehension
later
the
sheik
was
caught
bargaining
for
a
camel
train
with
the
old
gentleman
in
the
undoubtedly
the
sheik
was
about
to
lead
them
into
the
desert
for
no
good
purpose
a
dreadful
fate
seemed
in
store
for
the
girl
but
she
must
be
left
to
face
it
without
the
support
of
merton
gill
the
lately
hired
extras
were
now
dismissed
they
trooped
back
to
the
dressing
room
to
doff
their
flowing
robes
and
remove
the
bedouin
merton
gill
went
from
the
dressing
room
to
the
little
window
through
which
he
had
received
his
robe
and
his
slip
was
returned
to
him
signed
by
the
assistant
director
it
had
now
become
a
paper
of
value
even
to
patterson
but
she
was
never
to
know
this
for
its
owner
went
down
the
street
to
another
window
and
relinquished
it
for
a
bill
the
bill
was
adorned
with
a
portrait
of
benjamin
harrison
smugly
radiating
prosperity
from
every
hair
in
his
beard
he
was
clearly
one
who
had
never
gone
hungry
nor
betrayed
the
confidence
of
a
society
woman
counting
upon
her
room
rent
strictly
in
advance
the
portrait
of
this
successful
man
was
borne
swiftly
to
the
cafeteria
where
its
present
owner
lavishly
heaped
a
tray
with
excellent
food
and
hastened
with
it
to
a
table
he
ate
with
but
slight
regard
for
his
surroundings
beulah
baxter
herself
might
have
occupied
a
neighbouring
table
without
coming
to
his
notice
at
once
he
was
very
hungry
the
soup
had
proved
to
be
little
more
than
an
appetizer
in
his
first
ardour
he
forgot
his
plight
it
was
not
until
later
in
the
meal
that
the
accusing
face
of
patterson
came
between
him
and
the
last
of
his
stew
which
he
secured
with
blotters
of
bread
even
then
he
ignored
the
woman
he
had
other
things
to
think
of
he
had
to
think
of
where
he
should
sleep
that
night
but
for
once
he
had
eaten
enough
his
optimism
was
again
enthroned
sleeping
after
all
was
not
like
eating
there
were
more
ways
to
manage
it
the
law
of
sleep
would
in
time
enforce
itself
while
eating
did
nothing
of
the
sort
you
might
sleep
for
nothing
but
someone
had
to
be
paid
if
you
ate
he
cheerfully
paid
eighty
cents
for
his
repast
the
catsup
as
an
appetizer
had
been
ruinous
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
he
left
the
cafeteria
and
the
cheerful
activities
of
the
lot
were
drawing
to
a
close
extra
people
from
the
various
stages
were
hurrying
to
the
big
dressing
room
whence
they
would
presently
stream
slips
in
hand
toward
the
cashier
s
window
belated
principals
came
in
from
their
work
to
resume
their
choice
street
garments
and
be
driven
off
in
choice
motor
cars
merton
gill
in
deep
thought
traversed
the
street
between
the
big
stages
and
the
dressing
rooms
still
in
deep
thought
he
retraced
his
steps
and
at
the
front
office
turned
off
to
the
right
on
a
road
that
led
to
the
deserted
street
of
the
western
town
his
head
bowed
in
thought
he
went
down
this
silent
thoroughfare
his
footsteps
echoing
along
the
way
lined
by
the
closed
shops
the
happy
days
saloon
and
joe
buy
or
sell
the
and
the
restaurant
alike
slept
for
want
of
custom
he
felt
again
the
eeriness
of
this
desertion
and
hurried
on
past
the
silent
places
emerging
from
the
lower
end
of
this
street
he
came
upon
a
log
cabin
where
activity
still
survived
he
joined
the
group
before
its
door
inside
two
cameras
were
recording
some
drama
of
the
rude
frontier
over
glowing
coals
in
the
stone
fireplace
a
beautiful
young
girl
prepared
food
in
a
frying
pan
at
a
table
in
the
room
s
centre
two
bearded
miners
seemed
to
be
appraising
a
buckskin
pouch
of
nuggets
pouring
them
from
hand
to
hand
a
candle
stuck
in
a
bottle
flickered
beside
them
they
were
honest
kindly
faced
miners
roughly
dressed
and
heavily
bearded
but
it
could
be
seen
that
they
had
hearts
of
gold
the
beautiful
young
girl
who
wore
a
simple
dress
of
blue
calico
and
whose
hair
hung
about
her
fair
face
in
curls
of
a
radiant
buff
now
served
them
food
and
poured
steaming
coffee
from
a
large
pot
the
miners
seemed
loth
to
eat
being
excited
by
the
gold
nuggets
they
must
have
struck
it
rich
that
day
merton
gill
divined
and
now
with
wealth
untold
they
would
be
planning
to
send
the
girl
east
to
school
they
both
patted
her
affectionately
keeping
from
her
the
great
surprise
they
had
in
store
the
girl
was
arch
with
them
and
prettily
kissed
each
upon
his
bald
head
merton
at
once
saw
that
she
would
be
the
daughter
of
neither
she
would
be
their
ward
and
perhaps
they
weren
t
planning
to
send
her
to
school
perhaps
they
were
going
to
send
her
to
fashionable
relatives
in
the
east
where
she
would
unwittingly
become
the
rival
of
her
beautiful
but
cousin
for
the
hand
of
a
rich
young
and
be
and
long
for
the
old
miners
who
would
get
word
of
it
and
buy
some
fine
clothes
from
joe
buy
or
sell
and
go
east
to
the
consternation
of
the
rich
relatives
and
see
that
their
little
mountain
flower
was
treated
right
as
he
identified
this
he
studied
the
interior
of
the
cabin
the
rough
table
at
which
the
three
now
ate
the
makeshift
chairs
the
rifle
over
the
fireplace
the
picks
and
shovels
the
shelf
along
the
wall
with
its
crude
dishes
the
calico
curtain
screening
off
what
would
be
the
dressing
room
of
the
little
mountain
flower
it
was
a
room
for
all
its
roughness
along
one
wall
were
two
bunks
one
above
the
other
well
supplied
with
blankets
the
director
after
a
final
shot
of
one
of
the
miners
being
scalded
by
his
coffee
which
he
drank
from
a
saucer
had
said
all
right
boys
we
ll
have
the
fight
first
thing
in
the
merton
gill
passed
on
he
didn
t
quite
know
what
the
fight
would
be
about
surely
the
two
miners
wouldn
t
fight
perhaps
another
miner
of
loose
character
would
come
along
and
try
to
jump
their
claim
or
attempt
some
dirty
work
with
the
little
girl
something
like
that
he
carried
with
him
the
picture
of
the
homey
little
ulterior
the
fireplace
with
its
cooking
utensils
the
two
bunks
with
their
ample
stock
of
blankets
the
crude
door
closed
with
a
wooden
bar
and
a
leather
which
hung
trustfully
outside
in
other
circumstances
chiefly
those
in
which
merton
gill
had
now
been
the
prominent
figure
in
the
film
world
he
meant
one
day
to
become
he
would
on
this
night
have
undoubtedly
won
public
attention
for
his
mysterious
disappearance
the
modest
room
in
the
patterson
home
to
which
for
three
months
he
had
unfailingly
come
after
the
first
picture
show
on
this
night
went
untenanted
the
guardian
at
the
holden
gate
would
have
testified
that
he
had
not
passed
out
that
way
and
the
way
through
the
offices
had
been
closed
at
five
subsequent
to
which
hour
several
witnesses
could
have
sworn
to
seeing
him
still
on
the
lot
in
the
ensuing
search
even
the
tank
at
the
lower
end
of
the
lot
might
have
been
dragged
without
result
being
little
known
to
the
public
however
and
in
the
patterson
home
it
being
supposed
that
you
could
never
tell
about
actors
his
disappearance
for
the
night
caused
absolutely
no
slightest
ripple
public
attention
as
regarded
the
young
man
remained
at
a
calm
unflawed
by
even
the
mildest
curiosity
he
had
been
seen
perhaps
though
certainly
not
noted
with
any
interest
to
be
one
of
the
group
watching
a
night
scene
in
front
of
one
of
the
fifth
avenue
mansions
lights
shone
from
the
draped
windows
of
this
mansion
and
from
its
portals
issued
none
other
than
muriel
mercer
who
as
vera
vanderpool
freed
at
last
from
the
blight
of
broadway
was
leaving
her
palatial
home
to
cast
her
lot
finally
with
the
ardent
young
tenement
worker
with
the
high
forehead
she
descended
the
steps
paused
once
to
look
back
upon
the
old
home
where
she
had
been
taught
to
love
pleasure
above
the
things
of
life
then
came
on
to
the
waiting
limousine
being
greeted
here
by
the
young
man
with
the
earnest
forehead
who
had
won
her
to
the
better
way
the
missing
youth
might
later
have
been
observed
but
probably
was
not
walking
briskly
in
the
chill
night
toward
the
gate
that
led
to
the
outer
world
but
he
wheeled
abruptly
before
reaching
this
gate
and
walked
again
briskly
this
time
debouching
from
the
main
thoroughfare
into
the
black
silence
of
the
western
village
here
his
pace
slackened
and
halfway
down
the
street
he
paused
irresolutely
he
was
under
the
wooden
porch
of
the
fashion
restaurant
give
our
tamales
a
trial
he
lingered
here
but
a
moment
however
then
lurked
on
down
the
still
thoroughfare
keeping
well
within
the
shadow
of
the
low
buildings
just
beyond
the
street
was
the
log
cabin
of
the
miners
a
moment
later
he
could
not
have
been
observed
even
by
the
keenest
eye
nothing
marked
his
disappearance
at
least
nothing
that
would
have
been
noted
by
the
casual
minded
he
had
simply
gone
he
was
now
no
more
than
the
cowboys
and
sheriffs
and
gamblers
and
petty
tradesmen
who
had
once
peopled
this
street
of
silence
and
desolation
a
night
watchman
came
walking
presently
flashing
an
electric
torch
from
side
to
side
he
noticed
nothing
he
was
indeed
a
rather
imaginative
man
and
he
hoped
he
would
not
notice
anything
he
did
not
like
coming
down
this
ghostly
street
which
his
weak
mind
would
persist
in
peopling
with
phantom
crowds
from
picture
dramas
it
gave
him
the
creeps
as
he
had
more
than
once
confessed
he
hurried
on
flashing
his
torch
along
the
blind
fronts
of
the
shops
in
a
perfunctory
manner
he
was
especially
nervous
when
he
came
to
corners
and
he
was
glad
when
he
issued
from
the
little
street
into
the
wider
one
that
was
well
lighted
how
could
he
have
been
expected
to
notice
a
very
trifling
incongruous
detail
as
he
passed
the
log
cabin
indeed
many
a
and
entirely
valorous
night
watchman
might
have
neglected
to
observe
that
the
leathern
of
the
cabin
s
closed
door
was
no
longer
hanging
outside
chapter

clifford
armytage
the
outlaw
dawn
brought
the
wide
stretches
of
the
holden
lot
into
gray
relief
it
lightened
the
big
yellow
stages
and
crept
down
the
narrow
street
of
the
western
town
where
only
the
ghosts
of
dead
plays
stalked
it
burnished
the
rich
fronts
of
the
fifth
avenue
mansions
and
in
the
next
block
illumined
the
rough
sides
of
a
miner
s
cabin
with
more
difficulty
it
seeped
through
the
blurred
glass
of
the
one
window
in
this
structure
and
lightened
the
shadows
of
its
interior
to
a
pale
gray
the
rested
on
the
hearth
where
the
little
girl
had
left
it
the
dishes
of
the
overnight
meal
were
still
on
the
table
the
vacant
chairs
sprawled
about
it
and
the
rifle
was
in
its
place
above
the
rude
mantel
the
picks
and
shovels
awaited
the
toil
of
a
new
day
all
seemed
as
it
had
been
when
the
director
had
closed
the
door
upon
it
the
previous
night
but
then
the
blankets
in
the
lower
bunk
were
seen
to
heave
and
to
be
thrust
back
from
the
pale
face
of
merton
gill
an
elbow
came
into
play
and
the
head
was
raised
a
gaze
still
vague
with
sleep
travelled
about
the
room
in
dull
alarm
he
was
waking
up
in
his
little
room
at
the
patterson
house
and
he
couldn
t
make
it
look
right
he
rubbed
his
eyes
vigorously
and
pushed
himself
farther
up
his
mind
resumed
its
broken
threads
he
was
where
he
had
meant
to
be
from
the
moment
he
had
spied
the
blankets
in
those
bunks
in
quicker
alarm
now
he
reached
for
his
watch
perhaps
he
had
slept
too
late
and
would
be
discovered
arrested
jailed
he
found
his
watch
on
the
floor
beside
the
bunk
seven
o
clock
he
was
safe
he
could
dress
at
leisure
and
presently
be
an
actor
on
the
holden
lot
he
wondered
how
soon
he
could
get
food
at
the
cafeteria
sleeping
in
this
mountain
cabin
had
cursed
him
with
a
ravenous
appetite
as
if
he
had
indeed
been
far
off
in
the
keen
air
of
the
north
woods
he
crept
from
the
warm
blankets
and
from
under
the
straw
mattress
in
which
one
of
the
miners
had
hidden
the
pouch
of
nuggets
he
took
his
newly
pressed
trousers
upon
a
low
bench
across
the
room
was
a
battered
tin
wash
basin
a
bucket
of
water
brought
by
the
little
girl
from
the
spring
and
a
bar
of
yellow
soap
he
made
a
quick
toilet
and
at
a
good
hour
before
the
lot
would
wake
up
he
was
dressed
and
at
the
door
it
might
be
chancy
opening
that
door
so
he
peered
through
a
narrow
crack
at
first
listening
intently
he
could
hear
nothing
and
no
one
was
in
sight
he
pushed
the
latch
string
through
its
hole
then
opened
the
door
enough
to
emit
his
slender
shape
a
moment
later
ten
feet
from
the
closed
door
he
stood
at
ease
scanning
the
log
cabin
as
one
who
passing
by
had
been
attracted
by
its
quaint
architecture
then
glancing
in
both
directions
to
be
again
sure
that
he
was
unobserved
he
walked
away
from
his
new
home
he
did
not
slink
furtively
he
took
the
middle
of
the
street
and
there
was
a
bit
of
swagger
to
his
gait
he
felt
rather
set
up
about
this
adventure
he
reached
what
might
have
been
called
the
lot
s
civic
centre
and
cast
a
patronizing
eye
along
the
ends
of
the
big
stages
and
the
long
low
dressing
room
building
across
from
them
before
the
open
door
of
the
warehouse
he
paused
to
watch
a
truck
being
loaded
with
handsome
furniture
a
drawing
room
was
evidently
to
be
set
on
one
of
the
stages
rare
rugs
and
beautiful
chairs
and
tables
were
carefully
brought
out
he
had
rather
a
superintending
air
as
he
watched
this
process
he
might
have
been
taken
for
the
owner
of
these
costly
things
watching
to
see
that
no
harm
befell
them
he
strolled
on
when
the
truck
had
received
its
load
such
people
as
he
had
met
were
only
artisans
carpenters
electricians
he
faced
them
all
confidently
with
glances
of
slightly
amused
tolerance
they
were
good
men
in
their
way
but
they
were
not
actors
not
artists
in
the
neatly
landscaped
little
green
place
back
of
the
office
building
a
climbing
rose
grew
on
a
trellis
he
plucked
a
pink
bud
fixed
it
in
his
lapel
and
strolled
down
the
street
past
the
dressing
rooms
across
from
these
the
doors
of
the
big
stages
were
slid
back
and
inside
he
could
see
that
sets
were
being
assembled
the
truckload
of
furniture
came
to
one
of
these
doors
and
he
again
watched
it
as
the
stuff
was
carried
inside
for
all
these
workmen
knew
he
might
presently
be
earning
a
princely
salary
as
he
acted
amid
these
beautiful
objects
perhaps
attending
a
reception
in
a
fifth
avenue
mansion
where
the
father
of
a
beautiful
new
york
society
girl
would
tell
him
that
he
must
first
make
good
before
he
could
aspire
to
her
hand
and
he
would
make
good
out
there
in
the
great
open
spaces
where
the
girl
would
come
to
him
after
many
adventures
and
where
they
would
settle
to
an
untroubled
future
in
the
west
they
both
loved
he
had
slept
he
knew
where
with
luck
he
could
sleep
again
and
he
had
money
in
his
pocket
for
several
more
ample
meals
at
this
moment
he
felt
equal
to
anything
no
more
than
pleasantly
aware
of
his
hunger
sharpened
by
the
walk
in
this
keen
morning
air
he
made
a
nonchalant
progress
toward
the
cafeteria
motor
cars
were
now
streaming
through
the
gate
disgorging
other
actors
trim
young
men
and
beautiful
young
women
who
must
hurry
to
the
dressing
rooms
while
he
could
sit
at
ease
in
a
cafeteria
and
eat
heavily
of
sustaining
foods
inside
he
chose
from
the
restricted
menu
offered
by
the
place
at
this
early
hour
and
ate
in
a
leisurely
almost
condescending
manner
other
early
comers
wolfed
their
food
as
if
they
feared
to
be
late
for
work
but
he
suffered
no
such
anxiety
he
consumed
the
last
morsel
that
his
tray
held
drained
his
cup
of
coffee
and
jingled
the
abundant
silver
coin
in
his
pocket
true
underneath
it
as
he
plumed
himself
upon
his
adventure
was
a
certain
pestering
consciousness
that
all
was
not
so
well
with
him
as
observers
might
guess
but
he
resolutely
put
this
away
each
time
it
threatened
to
overwhelm
him
he
would
cross
no
bridge
until
he
came
to
it
he
even
combated
this
undercurrent
of
sanity
by
wording
part
of
an
interview
with
himself
some
day
to
appear
in
photo
land
clifford
armytage
smiled
that
rare
smile
which
his
admirers
have
found
so
winning
on
the
silver
screen
a
smile
reminiscent
tender
eloquent
of
adversities
happily
surmounted
yes
he
said
frankly
in
the
mellow
tones
that
are
his
i
guess
there
were
times
when
i
almost
gave
up
the
struggle
i
recall
one
spell
not
so
many
years
ago
when
i
camped
informally
on
the
holden
lot
sleeping
where
i
could
find
a
bed
and
stinting
myself
in
food
to
eke
out
my
little
savings
yet
i
look
back
upon
that
time
he
mischievously
pulled
the
ears
of
the
magnificent
great
dane
that
lolled
at
his
feet
as
one
of
the
happiest
in
my
career
because
i
always
knew
that
my
day
would
come
i
had
done
only
a
few
little
bits
but
they
had
stood
out
and
the
directors
had
noticed
me
not
once
did
i
permit
myself
to
become
discouraged
and
so
i
say
to
your
readers
who
may
feel
that
they
have
in
them
the
stuff
for
truly
creative
screen
art
he
said
it
dreaming
above
the
barren
tray
said
it
as
harold
parmalee
had
said
it
in
a
late
interview
extorted
from
him
by
augusta
blivens
for
the
refreshment
of
his
host
of
admirers
who
read
photo
land
he
was
still
saying
it
as
he
paid
his
check
at
the
counter
breaking
off
only
to
reflect
that
cents
was
a
good
deal
to
be
paying
for
food
so
early
in
the
day
for
of
course
he
must
eat
again
before
seeking
shelter
of
the
humble
miner
s
cabin
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
blankets
might
be
gone
by
nightfall
he
hoped
they
would
have
trouble
with
the
fight
scene
he
hoped
there
would
be
those
annoying
delays
that
so
notoriously
added
to
the
cost
of
producing
the
screen
drama
long
waits
when
no
one
seemed
to
know
what
was
being
waited
for
and
bored
actors
lounged
about
in
apathy
he
hoped
the
fight
would
be
a
long
fight
you
needed
blankets
even
in
sunny
california
he
went
out
to
pass
an
enlivening
day
fairly
free
of
misgiving
he
found
an
abundance
of
entertainment
on
one
stage
he
overlooked
for
half
an
hour
a
fragment
of
the
desert
drama
which
he
had
assisted
the
previous
day
a
covered
incline
led
duskily
down
to
the
deserted
tomb
in
which
the
young
man
and
the
beautiful
english
girl
were
to
take
shelter
for
the
night
they
would
have
eluded
the
bad
sheik
for
a
little
while
and
in
the
tomb
the
young
man
would
show
himself
to
be
a
gentleman
by
laying
not
so
much
as
a
finger
upon
the
defenceless
girl
but
this
soon
palled
upon
the
watching
connoisseur
the
actual
shots
were
few
and
separated
by
barren
intervals
of
waiting
for
that
mysterious
something
which
photoplays
in
production
seemed
to
need
being
no
longer
identified
with
this
drama
he
had
lost
much
of
his
concern
over
the
fate
in
store
for
the
girl
though
he
knew
she
would
emerge
from
the
ordeal
as
pure
as
she
was
beautiful
a
bit
foolish
at
moments
perhaps
but
good
he
found
that
he
was
especially
interested
in
bedroom
scenes
on
stage
four
a
sumptuous
bedroom
vacant
for
the
moment
enchained
him
for
a
long
period
of
contemplation
the
bed
was
of
some
rare
wood
ornately
carved
with
a
silken
canopy
spread
with
finest
linen
and
quilts
of
down
its
pillows
opulent
in
their
embroidered
cases
the
hide
of
a
polar
bear
its
head
mounted
with
open
jaws
spread
over
the
rich
rug
beside
the
bed
he
wondered
about
this
interestingly
probably
the
stage
would
be
locked
at
night
still
at
a
suitable
hour
he
could
descreetly
find
out
on
another
stage
a
bedroom
likewise
intrigued
him
though
this
was
a
squalid
room
in
a
tenement
and
the
bed
was
a
cheap
thing
sparsely
covered
and
in
sad
disorder
people
were
working
on
this
set
and
he
presently
identified
the
play
for
muriel
mercer
in
a
neat
black
dress
entered
to
bring
comfort
to
the
tenement
dwellers
but
this
play
too
had
ceased
to
interest
him
he
knew
that
vera
vanderpool
had
escaped
the
blight
of
broadway
to
choose
the
worthwhile
the
true
the
vital
things
of
life
and
that
was
about
all
he
now
cared
to
know
of
the
actual
play
this
tenement
bed
had
become
for
him
its
outstanding
dramatic
value
he
saw
himself
in
it
for
a
good
night
s
rest
waking
refreshed
in
plenty
of
time
to
be
dressed
and
out
before
the
tenement
people
would
need
it
he
must
surely
learn
if
the
big
sliding
doors
to
these
stages
were
locked
overnight
he
loitered
about
the
stages
until
late
afternoon
with
especial
attention
to
sleeping
apartments
in
one
gripping
drama
he
felt
cheated
the
set
showed
the
elaborately
fitted
establishment
of
a
fashionable
modiste
mannequins
in
wondrous
gowns
came
through
parted
curtains
to
parade
before
the
shop
s
clientele
mostly
composed
of
society
butterflies
one
man
hovered
attentive
about
the
most
beautiful
of
these
and
whispered
entertainingly
as
she
scanned
the
gowns
submitted
to
her
choice
he
was
a
dissolute
looking
man
although
faultlessly
arrayed
his
hair
was
thin
his
eyes
were
cruel
and
his
face
bespoke
the
expert
merton
gill
at
once
detected
that
the
beautiful
young
woman
he
whispered
to
would
be
one
of
those
light
headed
wives
who
care
more
for
fashionable
dress
than
for
the
good
name
of
their
husbands
he
foresaw
that
the
creature
would
be
trapped
into
the
power
of
this
villain
by
her
love
of
finery
though
he
was
sure
that
the
end
would
find
her
still
a
good
woman
the
mannequins
finished
their
parade
and
the
throng
of
patrons
broke
up
the
cameras
were
pushed
to
an
adjoining
room
where
the
french
proprietor
of
the
place
figured
at
a
desk
the
dissolute
came
back
to
question
him
his
errant
fancy
had
been
caught
by
one
of
the
mannequins
the
most
beautiful
of
them
a
blonde
with
a
flowerlike
face
and
a
figure
whose
perfection
had
been
boldly
attested
by
the
gowns
she
had
worn
the
unprincipled
proprietor
at
once
demanded
from
a
forewoman
that
this
girl
be
sent
for
after
which
he
discreetly
withdrew
the
waiting
scoundrel
sat
and
complacently
pinched
the
ends
of
his
small
dark
mustache
it
could
be
seen
that
he
was
one
of
those
who
believe
that
money
will
buy
anything
the
fair
girl
entered
and
was
leeringly
entreated
to
go
out
to
dinner
with
him
it
appeared
that
she
never
went
out
to
dinner
with
any
one
but
spent
her
evenings
with
her
mother
who
was
very
very
ill
her
unworthy
admirer
persisted
then
the
telephone
on
the
manager
s
desk
called
her
her
mother
was
getting
worse
the
beautiful
face
was
now
suffused
with
agony
but
this
did
not
deter
the
man
from
his
loathsome
advances
there
was
another
telephone
call
she
must
come
at
once
if
she
were
to
see
her
mother
alive
the
man
seized
her
they
struggled
all
seemed
lost
even
the
choice
gown
she
still
wore
but
she
broke
away
to
be
told
over
the
telephone
that
her
mother
had
died
even
this
sad
news
made
no
impression
upon
the
wretch
he
seemed
to
be
a
man
of
one
idea
again
he
seized
her
and
the
maddened
girl
stabbed
him
with
a
pair
of
long
gleaming
shears
that
had
lain
on
the
manager
s
desk
he
fell
lifeless
at
her
feet
while
the
girl
stared
in
horror
at
the
weapon
she
still
grasped
merton
gill
would
not
have
lingered
for
this
there
were
tedious
waits
and
scenes
must
be
rehearsed
again
and
again
even
the
agony
of
the
girl
as
she
learned
of
her
mother
s
passing
must
be
done
over
and
over
at
the
insistence
of
a
director
who
seemed
to
know
what
a
young
girl
should
feel
at
these
moments
but
merton
had
watched
from
his
place
back
of
the
lights
with
fresh
interest
from
the
moment
it
was
known
that
the
girl
s
poor
old
mother
was
an
invalid
for
he
had
at
first
believed
that
the
mother
s
bedroom
would
be
near
by
he
left
promptly
when
it
became
apparent
that
the
mother
s
bedroom
would
not
be
seen
in
this
drama
they
would
probably
show
the
doctor
at
the
other
telephone
urging
the
girl
to
hurry
home
and
show
him
again
announcing
that
all
was
over
but
the
expense
of
mother
and
her
deathbed
had
been
saved
he
cared
little
for
the
ending
of
this
play
already
he
was
becoming
a
little
callous
to
the
plight
of
beautiful
young
girls
threatened
with
the
loss
of
that
which
they
held
most
dear
purposely
all
day
he
had
avoided
the
neighbourhood
of
his
humble
miner
s
home
he
thought
it
as
well
that
he
should
not
be
seen
much
around
there
he
ate
again
at
four
o
clock
heartily
and
rather
expensively
and
loafed
about
the
stages
until
six
then
he
strolled
leisurely
down
the
village
street
and
out
the
lower
end
to
where
he
could
view
the
cabin
work
for
the
day
was
plainly
over
the
director
and
his
assistant
lingered
before
the
open
door
in
consultation
a
property
man
and
an
electrician
were
engaged
inside
but
a
glance
as
he
passed
showed
that
the
blankets
were
still
in
the
bunks
he
did
not
wait
to
see
more
but
passed
on
with
all
evidences
of
disinterest
in
this
lowly
abode
he
ascertained
that
night
that
the
fight
must
have
been
had
the
table
was
overturned
one
of
the
chairs
wrecked
and
there
were
other
signs
of
disorder
probably
it
had
been
an
excellent
fight
probably
these
primitive
men
of
the
woods
had
battled
desperately
but
he
gave
little
consideration
to
the
combat
and
again
slept
warmly
under
the
blankets
perhaps
they
would
fight
again
or
perhaps
there
would
be
less
violent
bits
of
the
drama
that
would
secure
him
another
night
of
calm
repose
the
following
morning
found
him
slightly
disturbed
by
two
unforeseen
needs
arising
from
his
novel
situation
he
looked
carefully
at
his
collar
wondering
how
many
days
he
would
be
able
to
keep
it
looking
like
a
fresh
collar
and
he
regretted
that
he
had
not
brought
his
to
this
new
home
still
the
collar
was
in
excellent
shape
as
yet
and
a
scrutiny
of
his
face
in
the
cracked
mirror
hanging
on
the
log
wall
determined
that
he
could
go
at
least
another
day
without
shaving
his
beard
was
of
a
light
growth
gentle
in
texture
and
he
was
yet
far
from
the
plight
of
montague
eventually
to
be
sure
he
would
have
to
go
to
the
barber
shop
on
the
lot
and
pay
money
to
be
shaved
which
seemed
a
pity
because
an
actor
could
live
indefinitely
unshaven
but
could
live
without
food
for
the
merest
fragment
of
time
he
resolved
to
be
on
the
lookout
that
day
for
a
set
he
believed
they
were
not
common
in
the
photodrama
still
one
might
be
found
he
limited
himself
to
the
lightest
of
breakfasts
he
had
timidly
refrained
from
counting
his
silver
but
he
knew
he
must
be
frugal
he
rejoiced
at
this
economy
until
late
afternoon
when
because
of
it
he
simply
had
to
eat
a
heavier
dinner
than
he
had
expected
to
need
there
was
something
so
implacable
about
this
demand
for
food
if
you
skimped
in
the
morning
you
must
make
amends
at
the
next
meal
he
passed
the
time
as
on
the
previous
day
a
somewhat
blase
actor
resting
between
pictures
and
condescending
to
beguile
the
tedium
by
overlooking
the
efforts
of
his
professional
brethren
he
could
find
no
set
that
included
a
barber
shop
although
they
were
beds
on
every
hand
he
hoped
for
another
night
in
the
cabin
but
if
that
were
not
to
be
there
was
a
bed
easy
of
access
on
stage
three
when
he
had
observed
it
a
ghastly
old
father
was
coughing
out
his
life
under
its
blankets
nursed
only
by
his
daughter
a
beautiful
young
creature
who
sewed
by
his
bedside
and
who
would
doubtless
be
thrown
upon
the
world
in
the
very
next
reel
though
merton
was
glad
to
note
probably
not
until
the
next
day
yet
there
was
no
need
for
this
couch
of
the
tubercular
father
for
action
in
the
little
cabin
was
still
on
after
making
the
unhappy
discovery
in
the
cafeteria
that
his
appetite
could
not
be
hoodwinked
by
the
clumsy
subterfuge
of
calling
coffee
and
rolls
a
breakfast
some
six
hours
previously
he
went
boldly
down
to
stand
before
his
home
both
miners
were
at
work
inside
the
room
had
been
placed
in
order
again
though
the
little
mountain
flower
was
gone
a
letter
he
gathered
had
been
received
from
her
and
one
of
the
miners
was
about
to
leave
on
a
long
journey
merton
could
not
be
sure
but
he
supposed
that
the
letter
from
the
little
girl
told
that
she
was
unhappy
in
her
new
surroundings
perhaps
being
by
the
supercilious
eastern
relatives
the
miner
who
was
to
remain
helped
the
other
to
pack
his
belongings
in
a
quaint
old
carpet
sack
and
together
they
undid
a
bundle
which
proved
to
contain
a
splendid
new
suit
not
only
this
but
now
came
a
scene
of
eloquent
appeal
to
the
watcher
outside
the
door
the
miner
who
was
to
remain
expressed
stern
disapproval
of
the
departing
miner
s
beard
it
would
never
do
he
was
seen
to
intimate
and
when
the
other
miner
portrayed
helplessness
a
new
package
was
unwrapped
and
a
safety
razor
revealed
to
his
shocked
gaze
at
this
sight
merton
gill
felt
himself
growing
too
emotional
for
a
mere
careless
bystander
and
withdrew
to
a
distance
where
he
could
regain
better
control
of
himself
when
he
left
the
miner
to
be
shorn
was
betraying
comic
dismay
while
the
other
pantomimed
the
correct
use
of
the
implement
his
thoughtfulness
had
provided
when
he
returned
after
half
s
rather
nervous
walk
up
another
street
the
departing
miner
was
clean
shaven
and
one
might
note
the
new
razor
glittering
on
the
low
bench
beside
the
battered
tin
basin
they
worked
late
in
his
home
that
night
trifling
scenes
were
taken
and
retaken
the
departing
miner
had
to
dress
in
his
splendid
but
new
garments
and
to
bid
an
affectionate
farewell
to
his
partner
then
had
to
dress
in
his
old
clothes
again
for
some
bit
that
had
been
forgotten
only
to
don
the
new
suit
for
at
another
time
merton
gill
might
have
resented
this
tediously
affair
which
was
keeping
him
from
his
rest
for
he
had
come
to
look
upon
this
structure
as
one
having
rights
in
it
after
a
certain
hour
but
a
sight
of
the
razor
which
had
not
been
touched
allayed
any
possible
feeling
of
irritation
it
was
before
the
big
lights
jarred
finally
off
and
the
director
said
that
s
all
then
he
turned
to
call
jimmie
hey
jimmie
where
s
that
gone
to
now
here
burke
yes
we
ve
finished
the
shack
stuff
let
s
see
he
looked
at
the
watch
on
his
wrist
that
ll
be
all
for
tonight
strike
this
first
thing
tomorrow
yes
sir
said
jimmie
the
door
was
closed
and
the
men
walked
away
merton
trailed
them
a
bit
not
remaining
too
pointedly
near
the
cabin
he
circled
around
through
fifth
avenue
to
regain
the
place
softly
he
let
himself
in
and
groped
through
the
dark
until
his
hand
closed
upon
the
abandoned
razor
satisfying
himself
that
fresh
blades
had
accompanied
it
he
made
ready
for
bed
he
knew
it
was
to
be
his
last
night
in
this
shelter
the
director
had
told
jimmie
to
strike
it
first
thing
in
the
morning
the
cabin
would
still
be
there
but
it
would
contain
no
homely
furniture
no
chairs
no
table
no
no
and
most
vital
of
lacks
it
would
be
devoid
of
blankets
yet
this
knowledge
did
not
dismay
him
he
slept
peacefully
after
praying
that
something
good
would
happen
to
him
he
put
it
that
way
very
simply
he
had
placed
himself
it
seemed
where
things
could
only
happen
to
him
he
was
he
felt
beyond
bringing
them
about
chapter
ix
more
ways
than
one
early
he
was
up
to
bathe
and
shave
he
shaved
close
to
make
it
last
longer
until
his
tender
face
reddened
under
the
scraping
probably
he
would
not
find
another
cabin
in
which
a
miner
would
part
with
his
beard
for
an
eastern
trip
probably
he
would
have
to
go
to
the
barber
the
next
time
he
also
succeeded
with
soap
and
water
in
removing
a
stain
from
his
collar
it
was
still
a
decent
collar
not
immaculate
perhaps
but
entirely
possible
this
day
he
took
eggs
with
his
breakfast
intending
to
wheedle
his
appetite
with
a
lighter
second
meal
than
it
had
demanded
the
day
before
he
must
see
if
this
would
not
average
better
on
the
day
s
overhead
after
breakfast
he
was
irresistibly
drawn
to
view
the
moving
picture
of
his
old
home
being
dismantled
he
knew
now
that
he
might
stand
brazenly
there
without
possible
criticism
he
found
jimmy
and
a
companion
already
busy
much
of
the
furniture
was
outside
to
be
carted
away
jimmy
as
merton
lolled
idly
in
the
doorway
emptied
the
blackened
coffee
pot
into
the
ashes
of
the
fireplace
and
then
proceeded
to
spoon
into
the
same
refuse
heap
half
a
kettle
of
beans
upon
which
the
honest
miners
had
once
feasted
the
watcher
deplored
that
he
had
not
done
more
than
taste
the
beans
when
he
had
taken
his
final
survey
of
the
place
this
morning
they
had
been
good
beans
but
to
do
more
than
taste
them
would
have
been
stealing
now
he
saw
them
thrown
away
and
regretted
that
he
could
not
have
known
what
their
fate
was
to
be
there
had
been
enough
of
them
to
save
him
a
day
s
expenses
he
stood
aside
as
the
two
boys
brought
out
the
cooking
utensils
the
rifle
the
miners
tools
to
stow
them
in
a
waiting
handcart
when
they
had
loaded
this
vehicle
they
trundled
it
on
up
the
narrow
street
of
the
western
town
yet
they
went
only
a
little
way
halting
before
one
of
the
street
s
largest
buildings
a
sign
above
its
wooden
porch
flaunted
the
name
crystal
palace
hotel
they
unlocked
its
front
door
and
took
the
things
from
the
cart
inside
from
the
street
the
watcher
could
see
them
stowing
these
away
the
room
appeared
to
contain
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
articles
needed
in
the
ruder
sort
of
photodrama
emptying
their
cart
they
returned
with
it
to
the
cabin
for
another
load
merton
gill
stepped
to
the
doorway
and
peered
in
from
apparently
idle
curiosity
he
could
see
a
row
of
saddles
on
wooden
supports
there
were
kitchen
stoves
lamps
painted
chairs
and
heavy
earthenware
dishes
on
shelves
his
eyes
wandered
over
these
articles
until
they
came
to
rest
upon
a
pile
of
blankets
at
one
side
of
the
room
they
were
neatly
folded
and
they
were
many
down
before
the
cabin
he
could
see
the
handcart
being
reloaded
by
jimmie
and
his
helper
otherwise
the
street
was
empty
the
young
man
at
the
doorway
stepped
lightly
in
and
regarded
the
windows
on
either
side
of
the
door
he
sauntered
to
the
street
and
appeared
to
be
wondering
what
he
would
examine
next
in
this
curious
world
he
passed
jimmie
and
the
other
boy
returning
with
the
last
load
from
the
cabin
he
noted
at
the
top
of
the
load
the
mattress
on
which
he
had
lain
for
three
nights
and
the
blankets
that
had
warmed
him
but
he
was
proved
not
to
be
so
helpless
as
he
had
thought
again
he
knew
where
a
good
night
s
rest
might
be
had
by
one
using
ordinary
discretion
again
that
day
the
fourth
of
his
double
life
he
went
the
mad
pace
a
carefree
youth
sauntering
idly
from
stage
to
stage
regarding
nonchalantly
the
joys
and
griefs
the
twistings
of
human
destiny
there
variously
unfolded
not
only
was
he
this
to
the
casual
public
notice
to
himself
he
was
this
at
least
consciously
true
in
those
nether
regions
of
the
mind
so
lately
discovered
and
now
being
so
expertly
probed
by
science
in
the
mind
s
dark
basement
so
to
say
a
certain
unlovely
fronted
dragon
of
reality
would
issue
from
the
gloom
where
it
seemed
to
have
been
lurking
and
force
itself
upon
his
notice
this
would
be
at
oddly
contented
moments
when
he
least
feared
the
future
when
he
was
most
successfully
being
to
himself
all
that
he
must
seem
to
others
at
such
times
when
he
leisurely
walked
a
world
of
plenty
and
fruition
the
dragon
would
from
its
subconscious
lair
to
chill
him
with
its
head
composed
entirely
of
repellent
facts
then
a
stout
effort
would
be
required
to
send
the
thing
back
where
it
belonged
to
those
lower
decently
hidden
levels
of
the
mind
life
and
the
dragon
was
cunning
from
hour
to
hour
growing
more
restive
it
employed
devices
of
craft
and
subtlety
as
when
merton
gill
carefree
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
strolling
lightly
to
another
point
of
interest
graciously
receptive
to
the
pleasant
life
about
him
would
suddenly
discover
that
a
part
of
his
mind
without
superintendence
had
for
some
moments
been
composing
a
letter
something
that
ran
in
effect
mr
gashwiler
dear
sir
i
have
made
certain
changes
in
my
plans
since
i
first
came
to
sunny
california
and
getting
quite
a
little
homesick
for
good
old
simsbury
and
i
thought
i
would
write
you
about
taking
back
my
old
job
in
the
emporium
and
now
about
the
money
for
the
ticket
back
to
simsbury
the
railroad
fare
is
he
was
truly
amazed
when
he
found
this
sort
of
thing
going
on
in
that
part
of
his
mind
he
didn
t
watch
it
was
scandalous
he
would
indignantly
snatch
the
letter
and
tear
it
up
each
time
he
found
it
unaccountably
under
way
it
was
surely
funny
the
way
your
mind
would
keep
doing
things
you
didn
t
want
it
to
do
as
again
this
very
morning
when
with
his
silver
coin
out
in
his
hand
he
had
merely
wished
to
regard
it
as
a
great
deal
of
silver
coin
a
store
of
plenty
against
famine
which
indeed
it
looked
to
be
under
a
scrutiny
it
looked
like
as
much
as
two
dollars
and
fifty
cents
and
he
would
have
preferred
to
pocket
it
again
with
this
impression
yet
that
rebellious
other
part
of
his
mind
had
basely
counted
the
coin
even
while
he
eyed
it
approvingly
and
it
had
persisted
in
shouting
aloud
that
it
was
not
two
dollars
and
fifty
cents
but
one
dollar
and
eighty
five
cents
the
counting
part
of
the
mind
made
no
comment
on
this
discrepancy
it
did
not
say
that
this
discovery
put
things
in
a
very
different
light
it
merely
counted
registered
the
result
and
ceased
to
function
with
an
air
of
saying
that
it
would
ascertain
the
facts
without
prejudice
and
you
could
do
what
you
liked
about
them
it
didn
t
care
that
night
a
solitary
guest
enjoyed
the
quiet
hospitality
of
the
crystal
palace
hotel
he
might
have
been
seen
but
was
not
to
effect
a
late
evening
entrance
to
this
snug
inn
by
means
of
a
front
window
which
had
it
would
seem
at
some
earlier
hour
of
the
day
been
unfastened
from
within
here
a
but
sufficing
bed
was
contrived
on
the
floor
of
the
lobby
from
a
pile
of
neatly
folded
blankets
at
hand
and
a
second
night
s
repose
was
enjoyed
by
the
lonely
patron
who
again
at
an
early
hour
of
the
morning
after
thoughtfully
refolding
the
blankets
that
had
protected
him
was
at
some
pains
to
leave
the
place
as
he
had
entered
it
without
attracting
public
notice
perchance
of
unpleasant
character
on
this
day
it
would
not
have
been
possible
for
any
part
of
the
mind
whatsoever
to
misvalue
the
remaining
treasure
of
silver
coin
it
had
become
inconsiderable
and
even
if
kept
from
view
could
be
and
was
counted
again
and
again
by
mere
blind
fingertips
they
contracted
indeed
a
senseless
habit
of
confining
themselves
in
a
trouser
s
pocket
to
count
the
the
quarter
and
the
two
dimes
long
after
the
total
was
too
well
known
to
its
owner
nor
did
this
total
unimpressive
at
best
long
retain
even
these
poor
dimensions
a
visit
to
the
cafeteria
in
response
to
the
imperious
demands
of
a
familiar
organic
process
resulted
in
less
labour
by
two
dimes
for
the
stubbornly
reiterative
fingertips
an
ensuing
visit
to
the
holden
lot
barber
in
obedience
to
social
demands
construed
to
be
equally
imperious
with
the
physical
reduced
all
subsequent
counting
whether
by
fingertips
or
a
glance
of
the
eye
to
barest
mechanical
routine
a
single
is
easy
to
count
still
on
the
following
morning
there
were
two
coins
to
count
true
both
were
dimes
a
diligent
search
among
the
miscellany
of
the
crystal
palace
hotel
had
failed
to
reveal
a
single
razor
the
razor
used
by
the
miner
should
in
all
reason
have
been
found
but
there
was
neither
that
nor
any
other
the
baffled
seeker
believed
there
must
have
been
crooked
work
somewhere
without
hesitation
he
found
either
jimmie
or
his
companion
to
be
guilty
of
malfeasance
in
office
but
at
least
one
item
of
more
or
less
worried
debate
was
eliminated
he
need
no
longer
weigh
mere
surface
gentility
against
the
stern
demands
of
an
active
metabolism
a
shave
cost
a
quarter
twenty
cents
would
not
buy
a
shave
but
it
would
buy
at
the
cafeteria
something
more
needful
to
any
one
but
a
fop
he
saw
himself
in
the
days
to
come
if
there
were
very
many
days
to
come
of
which
he
was
now
not
too
certain
descending
to
the
unwholesome
artistic
level
of
the
elder
montague
he
would
in
short
be
compelled
to
peddle
the
brush
and
of
course
as
yet
it
was
nothing
like
a
brush
nothing
to
kindle
the
eye
of
a
director
needing
genuine
brushes
in
the
early
morning
light
he
fingered
a
somewhat
gaunt
chin
and
wondered
how
long
they
would
require
to
grow
not
yet
could
he
be
taken
for
one
of
those
actors
compelled
by
the
rigorous
exactions
of
creative
screen
art
to
let
nature
have
its
course
with
his
beard
at
present
he
merely
needed
a
shave
and
the
collar
had
not
improved
with
usage
also
as
the
day
wore
on
coffee
with
one
egg
proved
to
have
been
not
fare
for
this
private
in
the
army
of
the
unemployed
still
his
morale
was
but
slightly
impaired
there
were
always
ways
it
seemed
and
the
later
hours
of
the
hungry
afternoon
were
rather
pleasantly
occupied
in
dwelling
upon
one
of
them
the
sole
guest
of
the
crystal
palace
hotel
entered
the
hostelry
that
night
somewhat
earlier
than
was
usual
indeed
at
the
very
earliest
moment
that
foot
traffic
through
the
narrow
street
seemed
to
have
diminished
to
a
point
where
the
entry
could
be
effected
without
incurring
the
public
notice
which
he
at
these
moments
so
sincerely
shunned
after
a
brief
interval
inside
the
lobby
he
issued
from
his
window
with
certain
objects
in
hand
one
of
which
dropped
as
he
clambered
out
the
resulting
clamour
seemed
to
rouse
far
echoes
along
the
dead
street
and
he
hastily
withdrew
with
a
smothered
exclamation
of
dismay
about
the
nearest
corner
of
the
building
until
it
could
be
ascertained
that
echoes
alone
had
been
aroused
after
a
little
breathless
waiting
he
slunk
down
the
street
keeping
well
within
friendly
shadows
stepping
softly
until
he
reached
the
humble
cabin
where
so
lately
the
honest
miners
had
enacted
their
he
jerked
the
of
the
door
and
was
swiftly
inside
groping
a
way
to
the
fireplace
here
he
lighted
matches
thoughtfully
appropriated
that
morning
from
the
cafeteria
counter
he
shielded
the
blaze
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
put
to
use
the
articles
he
had
brought
from
his
hotel
into
a
tin
cooking
pot
with
a
long
handle
he
now
hastily
ladled
beans
from
the
discarded
heap
in
the
fireplace
by
means
of
an
iron
spoon
he
was
not
too
careful
more
or
less
ashes
accompanied
the
nutritious
vegetables
as
the
pot
grew
to
be
half
full
that
was
a
thing
to
be
corrected
later
and
at
leisure
when
the
last
bean
had
been
salvaged
the
flame
of
another
match
revealed
an
unsuspected
item
a
of
bread
nestled
in
the
ashes
at
the
far
corner
of
the
fireplace
it
lacked
freshness
was
in
truth
withered
and
firm
to
the
touch
but
doubtless
more
wholesome
than
bread
freshly
baked
he
was
again
on
his
humble
cot
in
the
seclusion
of
the
crystal
palace
hotel
he
ate
at
leisure
it
being
inadvisable
to
light
matches
here
he
ate
chiefly
by
the
touch
system
there
was
a
marked
alkaline
flavour
to
the
repast
not
unpleasantly
counteracted
by
a
growth
of
vegetable
mould
of
delicate
lavender
tints
which
nature
had
been
decently
spreading
over
the
final
reduction
of
this
provender
to
its
basic
elements
but
the
time
was
not
one
in
which
to
cavil
about
minor
infelicities
ashes
wouldn
t
hurt
any
one
if
taken
in
moderation
you
couldn
t
see
the
mould
in
a
perfectly
dark
hotel
and
the
bread
was
good
the
feast
was
prolonged
until
a
late
hour
but
the
finger
tips
that
had
accurately
counted
money
in
a
dark
pocket
could
ascertain
in
a
dark
hotel
that
a
store
of
food
still
remained
he
pulled
the
blankets
about
him
and
sank
comfortably
to
rest
there
was
always
some
way
breakfast
the
next
morning
began
with
the
promise
of
only
moderate
enjoyment
somehow
in
the
gray
light
sifting
through
the
windows
the
beans
did
not
look
as
good
as
they
had
tasted
the
night
before
and
the
early
mouthfuls
were
less
blithesome
on
the
palate
than
the
remembered
ones
of
yesterday
he
thought
perhaps
he
was
not
so
hungry
as
he
had
been
at
his
first
encounter
with
them
he
delicately
removed
a
pocket
of
ashes
from
the
centre
and
tried
again
they
tasted
better
now
the
mould
of
tender
tints
was
again
visible
but
he
made
no
effort
to
avoid
it
for
his
appetite
had
reawakened
he
was
truly
hungry
and
ate
with
an
entire
singleness
of
purpose
toward
the
last
of
the
meal
his
conscious
self
feebly
prompted
him
to
quit
to
save
against
the
inevitable
hunger
of
the
night
but
the
voice
was
ignored
he
was
now
clay
to
the
moulding
of
the
subconscious
he
could
have
saved
a
few
of
the
beans
when
reason
was
again
enthroned
but
they
were
so
very
few
that
he
fatuously
thought
them
not
worth
saving
might
as
well
make
a
clean
job
of
it
he
restored
the
stewpan
and
spoon
to
their
places
and
left
his
hotel
he
was
fed
something
else
would
have
to
happen
the
plush
hat
cocked
at
a
rakish
angle
he
walked
abroad
with
something
of
the
old
confident
swagger
once
he
doubtfully
fingered
the
sprouting
beard
but
resolutely
dismissed
a
notion
of
finding
out
how
the
holden
lot
barber
would
regard
a
proposition
from
a
new
patron
to
open
a
charge
account
if
nothing
worse
than
remaining
unshaven
was
going
to
happen
to
him
what
cared
he
the
collar
was
still
pretty
good
why
let
his
beard
be
an
incubus
he
forgot
it
presently
in
noticing
that
the
people
arriving
on
the
holden
lot
all
looked
so
extremely
well
fed
he
thought
it
singular
that
he
should
never
before
have
noticed
how
many
people
one
saw
in
a
day
late
in
the
afternoon
his
explorations
took
him
beyond
the
lower
end
of
his
little
home
street
and
he
was
attracted
by
sounds
of
the
picture
drama
from
a
rude
board
structure
labelled
the
high
gear
dance
hall
he
approached
and
entered
with
that
calm
ease
of
manner
which
his
days
on
the
lot
had
brought
to
a
perfect
bloom
no
one
now
would
ever
suppose
that
he
was
a
mere
sightseer
or
chained
to
the
holden
lot
by
circumstances
over
which
he
had
ceased
to
exert
the
slightest
control
the
interior
of
the
high
gear
dance
hall
presented
nothing
new
to
his
seasoned
eye
it
was
the
made
familiar
by
many
a
smashing
western
the
picture
was
quite
normally
waiting
electricians
were
shoving
about
the
big
light
standards
cameras
were
being
moved
and
bored
actors
were
loafing
informally
at
the
round
tables
or
chatting
in
groups
about
the
set
one
actor
alone
was
keeping
in
his
part
a
ragged
bearded
unkempt
elderly
man
in
red
shirt
and
frayed
overalls
a
repellent
felt
hat
pulled
low
over
his
brow
reclined
on
the
floor
at
the
end
of
the
bar
his
back
against
a
barrel
apparently
he
slept
a
flash
of
remembrance
from
the
montague
girl
s
talk
identified
this
wretched
creature
this
was
what
happened
to
an
actor
who
had
to
peddle
the
brush
perhaps
for
days
he
had
been
compelled
to
sleep
there
in
the
interests
of
atmosphere
he
again
scanned
the
group
for
he
remembered
too
that
the
montague
girl
would
also
be
working
here
in
god
s
great
outdoors
his
eyes
presently
found
her
she
was
indeed
a
blonde
hussy
pitifully
rouged
depraved
beyond
redemption
she
stood
at
the
end
of
the
piano
and
in
company
with
another
of
the
girls
who
played
the
accompaniment
she
was
singing
a
ballad
the
refrain
of
which
he
caught
as
god
calls
them
angels
in
heaven
we
call
them
mothers
the
song
ended
the
montague
girl
stepped
to
the
centre
of
the
room
looked
aimlessly
about
her
then
seized
an
innocent
bystander
one
of
the
rough
characters
frequenting
this
unsavoury
resort
and
did
a
dance
with
him
among
the
tables
tiring
of
this
she
flitted
across
the
room
and
addressed
the
bored
director
who
impatiently
awaited
the
changing
of
lights
she
affected
to
consider
him
a
reporter
who
had
sought
an
interview
with
her
she
stood
erect
facing
him
with
one
hand
on
a
hip
the
other
patting
and
readjusting
her
blonde
coiffure
really
she
began
in
a
voice
of
pained
dignity
i
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
why
the
public
should
be
so
interested
in
me
what
can
i
say
to
your
readers
i
who
am
so
wholly
absorbed
in
my
art
that
i
can
t
think
of
hardly
anything
else
why
will
not
the
world
let
us
alone
hold
on
don
t
go
she
had
here
pretended
that
the
reporter
was
taking
her
at
her
word
she
seized
him
by
a
lapel
to
which
she
clung
while
with
her
other
arm
she
encircled
a
post
thus
anchoring
the
supposed
intruder
into
her
private
affairs
as
i
was
saying
she
resumed
all
this
publicity
is
highly
distasteful
to
the
artist
and
yet
since
you
have
forced
yourself
in
here
i
may
as
well
say
a
few
little
things
about
how
good
i
am
and
how
i
got
that
way
yes
i
have
nine
motor
cars
and
i
just
bought
a
lace
tablecloth
for
twelve
hundred
bones
she
broke
off
inconsequently
poor
victim
of
her
constitutional
frivolity
the
director
grinned
after
her
as
she
danced
away
though
merton
gill
had
considered
her
levity
in
the
worst
of
taste
then
her
eye
caught
him
as
he
stood
modestly
back
of
the
working
electricians
and
she
danced
forward
again
in
his
direction
he
would
have
liked
to
evade
her
but
saw
that
he
could
not
do
this
gracefully
she
greeted
him
with
an
impudent
grin
why
hello
trouper
as
i
live
the
actin
kid
she
held
out
a
hand
to
him
and
he
could
not
well
refuse
it
he
would
have
preferred
to
her
once
more
as
she
had
phrased
it
in
her
low
jargon
but
he
was
cornered
her
grip
of
his
hand
quite
astonished
him
with
its
vigour
well
how
s
everything
with
you
everything
jake
he
tried
for
a
show
of
easy
confidence
oh
yes
yes
indeed
everything
well
that
s
good
but
she
was
now
without
the
grin
and
was
running
a
practised
eye
over
what
might
have
been
called
his
production
the
hat
was
jaunty
enough
truly
a
hat
of
the
successful
but
all
below
that
the
collar
the
somewhat
rumpled
coat
the
trousers
crying
for
an
iron
despite
their
nightly
compression
beneath
their
slumbering
owner
the
shoes
not
too
recently
polished
and
more
than
all
a
certain
hunted
though
look
in
the
young
man
s
eyes
seemed
to
speak
eloquently
under
the
shrewd
glance
she
bent
on
him
say
listen
here
remember
i
been
trouping
man
and
boy
for
over
forty
year
and
it
s
hard
to
fool
me
you
working
he
resented
the
persistent
levity
of
manner
but
was
coerced
by
the
very
apparent
real
kindness
in
her
tone
well
he
looked
about
the
set
vaguely
in
his
discomfort
you
see
right
now
i
m
between
pictures
you
know
how
it
again
she
searched
his
eyes
and
spoke
in
a
lower
tone
well
all
right
but
you
needn
t
blush
about
it
the
blush
she
detected
became
more
flagrant
well
i
you
see
he
began
again
but
he
was
saved
from
being
explicit
by
the
call
of
an
assistant
director
miss
montague
miss
montague
where
s
that
flips
girl
on
the
set
she
skipped
lightly
from
him
when
she
returned
a
little
later
to
look
for
him
he
had
gone
he
went
to
bed
that
night
when
darkness
had
made
this
practicable
and
under
his
blankets
whiled
away
a
couple
of
wakeful
hours
by
running
tensely
dramatic
films
of
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
at
the
gashwiler
home
it
seemed
that
you
didn
t
fall
asleep
so
quickly
when
you
had
eaten
nothing
since
early
morning
never
had
he
achieved
such
perfect
photography
as
now
of
the
gashwiler
hash
and
light
biscuits
the
gashwiler
hot
cakes
and
sausage
and
never
had
gashwiler
so
impressively
carved
the
saturday
night
roast
of
tender
beef
gashwiler
achieved
a
sensational
triumph
in
the
scene
being
accorded
all
the
close
ups
that
the
most
exacting
of
screen
actors
could
wish
his
was
perfect
he
held
his
audience
enthralled
by
his
technique
gashwiler
too
had
a
small
but
telling
part
in
the
drama
only
a
character
bit
but
one
of
those
poignant
bits
that
stand
out
in
the
memory
the
subtitle
was
merton
won
t
you
let
me
give
you
another
piece
of
the
mince
pie
that
was
all
and
yet
as
screen
artists
say
it
got
over
there
came
very
near
to
being
not
a
dry
eye
in
the
house
when
the
simple
words
were
flashed
beside
an
insert
of
thick
mince
pies
with
quarters
cut
from
them
to
reveal
their
noble
interiors
sleep
came
at
last
while
he
was
regretting
that
lawless
orgy
of
the
morning
he
needn
t
have
cleaned
up
those
beans
in
that
silly
way
he
could
have
left
a
good
half
of
them
he
ran
what
might
have
been
considered
a
comedy
of
the
s
bottom
still
covered
with
perfectly
edible
beans
lightly
protected
with
nature
s
own
shroud
for
perishing
vegetable
matter
and
diversified
here
and
there
with
casual
small
deposits
of
ashes
in
the
morning
something
good
really
did
happen
as
he
folded
his
blankets
in
the
gray
light
a
hard
object
rattled
along
the
floor
from
them
he
picked
this
up
before
he
recognized
it
as
a
mutilated
fragment
from
the
stale
half
loaf
of
bread
he
had
salvaged
he
wondered
how
he
could
have
forgotten
it
even
in
the
plenitude
of
his
banquet
there
it
was
a
mere
nubbin
of
crust
and
so
hard
it
might
almost
have
been
taken
for
a
petrified
specimen
of
prehistoric
bread
yet
it
proved
to
be
rarely
palatable
it
s
flavour
was
exquisite
it
melted
in
the
mouth
somewhat
refreshed
by
this
modest
cheer
he
climbed
from
the
window
of
the
crystal
palace
with
his
mind
busy
on
two
tracks
while
the
letter
to
gashwiler
composed
itself
with
especially
clear
directions
about
where
the
return
money
should
be
sent
he
was
also
warning
himself
to
remain
throughout
the
day
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
door
of
the
cafeteria
he
had
proved
the
wisdom
of
this
even
the
day
before
that
had
started
with
a
bounteous
breakfast
the
aroma
of
cooked
food
occasionally
wafted
from
the
cafeteria
door
would
prove
he
was
sure
to
be
more
than
he
could
bear
he
rather
shunned
the
stages
keeping
more
to
himself
the
collar
he
had
to
confess
was
no
longer
even
to
the
casual
eye
what
a
successful
s
collar
should
be
the
sprouting
beard
might
still
be
misconstrued
as
the
whim
of
a
director
sanctified
to
realism
every
day
it
was
getting
to
look
more
like
that
but
no
director
would
have
commanded
the
wearing
of
such
a
collar
except
in
actual
work
where
it
might
have
been
a
striking
detail
in
the
apparel
of
an
underworldling
one
of
those
creatures
who
became
the
tools
of
rich
but
unscrupulous
roues
who
are
bent
upon
the
moral
destruction
of
beautiful
young
screen
heroines
he
knew
it
was
now
that
sort
of
collar
no
use
now
in
pretending
that
it
had
been
worn
yesterday
for
the
first
time
chapter
x
of
shattered
illusions
the
next
morning
he
sat
a
long
time
in
the
genial
sunlight
watching
carpenters
finish
a
scaffolding
beside
the
pool
that
had
once
floated
logs
to
a
sawmill
the
scaffolding
was
a
stout
affair
supporting
an
immense
tank
that
would
evidently
for
some
occult
reason
important
to
screen
art
hold
a
great
deal
of
water
the
sawmill
was
gone
at
one
end
of
the
pool
rode
a
small
with
one
mast
its
canvas
flapping
idly
in
a
gentle
breeze
its
deck
was
littered
with
rigging
upon
which
two
men
worked
they
seemed
to
be
getting
things
shipshape
for
a
cruise
when
he
had
tired
of
this
he
started
off
toward
the
high
gear
dance
hall
something
all
day
had
been
drawing
him
there
against
his
will
he
hesitated
to
believe
it
was
the
montague
girl
s
kindly
manner
toward
him
the
day
before
yet
he
could
identify
no
other
influence
probably
it
was
that
yet
he
didn
t
want
to
face
her
again
even
if
for
a
moment
she
had
quit
trying
to
be
funny
even
if
for
a
moment
her
eyes
had
searched
his
quite
earnestly
her
broad
amiable
face
glowing
with
that
sudden
friendly
concern
it
had
been
hard
to
withstand
this
yesterday
he
had
been
in
actual
danger
of
confiding
to
her
that
engagements
of
late
were
not
plentiful
something
like
that
and
it
would
be
harder
even
the
collar
would
make
it
harder
to
resist
the
confidence
that
he
was
not
at
this
time
overwhelmed
with
offers
for
his
art
he
had
for
what
seemed
like
an
interminable
stretch
of
time
been
solitary
and
an
outlaw
it
was
something
to
have
been
spoken
to
by
a
human
being
who
expressed
ever
so
fleeting
an
interest
in
his
affairs
even
by
someone
as
inconsequent
as
negligible
in
the
world
of
screen
artistry
as
this
lightsome
minx
who
because
of
certain
mental
infirmities
could
never
hope
for
the
least
enviable
eminence
in
a
profession
demanding
seriousness
of
purpose
still
it
would
be
foolish
to
go
again
to
the
set
where
she
was
she
might
think
he
was
encouraging
her
so
he
passed
the
high
gear
where
a
stage
watched
by
two
cameras
was
now
releasing
its
passengers
who
all
appeared
to
be
direct
from
new
york
and
walked
on
to
an
outdoor
set
that
promised
entertainment
this
was
the
narrow
street
of
some
quaint
european
village
scotch
he
soon
saw
from
the
dress
of
its
people
a
large
automobile
was
invading
this
remote
hamlet
to
the
dismay
of
its
inhabitants
rehearsed
through
a
megaphone
they
scurried
within
doors
at
its
approach
ancient
men
hobbling
on
sticks
and
frantic
mothers
grabbing
their
little
ones
from
the
path
of
the
monster
two
trial
trips
he
saw
the
car
make
the
length
of
the
little
street
at
its
lower
end
brooding
placidly
was
an
ancient
horse
rather
recalling
dexter
in
his
generously
exposed
bones
and
the
jaded
droop
of
his
head
above
a
low
stone
wall
twice
the
car
sped
by
him
arousing
no
sign
of
apprehension
nor
even
of
interest
he
paid
it
not
so
much
as
the
tribute
of
a
raised
eyelid
the
car
went
back
to
the
head
of
the
street
where
its
entrance
would
be
made
all
right
ready
came
the
megaphoned
order
again
the
peaceful
street
was
thrown
into
panic
by
this
snorting
dragon
from
the
outer
world
the
old
men
hobbled
affrightedly
within
doors
the
mothers
saved
their
children
and
this
time
to
the
stupefaction
of
merton
gill
even
the
old
horse
proved
to
be
an
actor
of
rare
merits
as
the
car
approached
he
seemed
to
suffer
a
painful
shock
he
tossed
his
aged
head
kicked
viciously
with
his
rear
feet
stood
absurdly
aloft
on
them
then
turned
and
fled
from
the
monster
as
merton
mused
upon
the
genius
of
the
trainer
who
had
taught
his
horse
not
only
to
betray
fright
at
a
motor
car
but
to
distinguish
between
rehearsals
and
the
actual
taking
of
a
scene
he
observed
a
man
who
emerged
from
a
clump
of
shrubbery
he
carried
a
shotgun
this
was
broken
at
the
breech
and
the
man
was
blowing
smoke
from
the
barrels
as
he
came
on
so
that
was
it
the
panic
of
the
old
horse
had
been
but
a
simple
reaction
to
a
couple
of
charges
of
perhaps
rock
salt
merton
gill
hoped
it
had
been
nothing
sterner
for
the
first
time
in
his
screen
career
he
became
cynical
about
his
art
a
thing
of
shame
of
machinery
of
subterfuge
nothing
would
be
real
perhaps
not
even
the
art
it
is
probable
that
lack
of
food
conduced
to
this
disparaging
outlook
and
he
recovered
presently
for
he
had
been
smitten
with
a
quick
vision
of
beulah
baxter
in
one
of
her
most
daring
exploits
she
at
least
was
real
deaf
to
entreaty
she
honestly
braved
her
hazards
it
was
a
comforting
thought
after
this
late
exposure
of
a
sham
in
this
slightly
combative
mood
he
retraced
his
steps
and
found
himself
outside
the
high
gear
dance
hall
fortified
for
another
possible
encounter
with
the
inquiring
and
obviously
sympathetic
montague
girl
he
entered
and
saw
that
she
was
not
on
the
set
the
was
for
the
moment
deserted
of
its
ribald
crew
while
an
honest
inhabitant
of
the
open
spaces
on
a
balcony
was
holding
a
large
revolver
to
the
shrinking
back
of
one
of
the
new
york
men
who
had
lately
arrived
by
the
stage
he
forced
this
man
who
was
plainly
not
honest
to
descend
the
stairs
and
to
sign
at
a
table
a
certain
paper
then
with
weapon
still
in
hand
the
honest
westerner
forced
the
cowardly
new
yorker
in
the
direction
of
the
front
door
until
they
had
passed
out
of
the
picture
on
this
the
bored
director
of
the
day
before
called
loudly
now
boys
in
your
places
you
ve
heard
a
shot
you
re
running
outside
to
see
what
s
the
matter
on
your
toes
now
try
it
from
rear
doors
came
the
motley
frequenters
of
the
place
led
by
the
elder
montague
they
trooped
to
the
front
in
two
lines
and
passed
from
the
picture
here
they
milled
about
waiting
for
further
orders
rotten
called
the
director
rotten
and
then
some
listen
you
came
like
a
lot
of
children
marching
out
of
a
public
school
don
t
come
in
lines
break
it
up
push
each
other
fight
to
get
ahead
and
you
re
noisy
too
you
re
shouting
you
re
saying
what
s
this
what
s
it
all
about
what
s
the
matter
which
way
did
he
go
say
anything
you
want
to
but
keep
shouting
anything
at
all
say
thar
s
gold
in
them
hills
if
you
can
t
think
of
anything
else
go
on
now
boys
do
it
again
and
pep
it
see
turn
the
juice
on
open
up
the
old
the
men
went
back
through
the
rear
doors
the
late
caller
would
here
have
left
being
fed
up
with
this
sort
of
stuff
but
at
that
moment
he
descried
the
montague
girl
back
behind
a
she
had
not
noted
him
but
was
in
close
talk
with
a
man
he
recognized
as
jeff
baird
arch
perpetrator
of
the
infamous
buckeye
comedies
they
came
toward
him
still
talking
as
he
looked
we
ll
finish
here
afternoon
anyway
the
girl
was
saying
fine
said
baird
that
makes
everything
jake
get
over
on
the
set
whenever
you
re
through
come
over
tonight
if
they
don
t
shoot
here
just
to
give
us
a
can

the
girl
soon
as
i

o
this
dump

lot
and
everything
and
be

shipwreck
and

and
all
like
that
gosh
i
hope
it
ain
t
cold
i
don
t
mind
the
water
but
i
certainly
hate
to
get
out
and
wait
in
wet
clothes
while
sig
rosenblatt
is
thinking
about
a
well
baird
turned
to
go
take
care
of
yourself
don
t
dive
and
forget
to
come
up
come
over
when
you
re
sure
s
long
here
the
girl
turning
from
baird
noted
merton
gill
beside
her
well
well
as
i
live
the
actin
kid
once
more
say
you
re
getting
to
be
a
regular
studio
hound
ain
t
you
for
the
moment
he
had
forgotten
his
troubles
he
was
burning
to
ask
her
if
beulah
baxter
would
really
work
in
a
shipwreck
scene
that
night
at
the
place
where
he
had
watched
the
carpenters
and
the
men
on
the
sailboat
but
as
he
tried
to
word
this
he
saw
that
the
girl
was
again
scanning
him
with
keen
eyes
he
knew
she
would
read
the
collar
the
beard
perhaps
even
a
look
of
mere
hunger
that
he
thought
must
now
be
showing
say
see
here
trouper
what
s
the
shootin
all
about
anyway
you
up
against
it
there
was
again
in
her
eye
the
look
of
warm
concern
and
she
was
no
longer
trying
to
be
funny
he
might
now
have
admitted
a
few
little
things
about
his
screen
career
but
again
the
director
interrupted
miss
montague
where
are
you
oh
well
remember
you
re
behind
the
piano
during
that
gun
play
just
now
and
you
stay
hid
till
after
the
boys
get
out
we
ll
shoot
this
time
so
get
she
sped
off
with
a
last
backward
glance
of
questioning
he
waited
but
a
moment
before
leaving
he
was
almost
forgetting
his
hunger
in
the
pretty
certain
knowledge
that
in
a
few
hours
he
would
actually
behold
his
in
at
least
one
of
her
daring
exploits
shipwreck
perhaps
she
would
be
all
but
drowned
he
hastened
back
to
the
pool
that
had
now
acquired
this
high
significance
the
carpenters
were
still
puttering
about
on
the
scaffold
he
saw
that
platforms
for
the
cameras
had
been
built
out
from
its
side
he
noted
too
and
was
puzzled
by
an
aeroplane
propeller
that
had
been
stationed
close
to
one
corner
of
the
pool
just
beyond
the
stern
of
the
little
perhaps
there
would
be
an
aeroplane
wreck
in
addition
to
a
shipwreck
now
he
had
something
besides
food
to
think
of
and
he
wondered
what
the
montague
girl
could
be
doing
in
the
company
of
a
really
serious
artist
like
beulah
baxter
from
her
own
story
she
was
going
to
get
wet
but
from
what
he
knew
of
her
she
would
be
some
character
not
greatly
missed
from
the
cast
if
she
should
as
baird
had
suggested
dive
and
forget
to
come
up
he
supposed
that
baird
had
meant
this
to
be
humorous
the
humour
typical
of
a
man
who
could
profane
a
great
art
with
the
atrocious
buckeye
comedies
so
called
he
put
in
the
hours
until
nightfall
in
aimless
wandering
and
idle
gazing
and
was
early
at
the
where
his
heroine
would
do
her
sensational
acting
it
was
now
a
scene
of
thrilling
activity
immense
lights
both
from
the
scaffolding
and
from
a
tower
back
of
the
flooded
its
deck
and
rigging
from
time
to
time
as
adjustments
were
made
the
rigging
was
slack
and
the
deck
was
still
littered
intentionally
so
he
now
perceived
the
gallant
little
boat
had
been
cruelly
buffeted
by
a
gale
two
sailors
in
piratical
dress
could
be
seen
to
emerge
at
intervals
from
the
cabin
suddenly
the
gale
was
on
with
terrific
force
the
sea
rose
in
great
waves
and
the
tiny
ship
rocked
in
a
perilous
manner
great
billows
of
water
swept
its
decks
merton
gill
stared
in
amazement
at
these
phenomena
so
dissonant
with
the
quiet
starlit
night
then
he
traced
them
without
difficulty
to
their
various
sources
the
gale
issued
from
the
swift
revolutions
of
that
aeroplane
propeller
he
had
noticed
a
while
ago
the
flooding
billows
were
spilled
from
the
big
tank
at
the
top
of
the
scaffold
and
the
boat
rocked
in
obedience
to
the
tugging
of
a
rope
tugged
from
the
shore
by
a
crew
of
helpers
that
ran
to
the
top
of
its
mast
thus
had
the
storm
been
produced
a
spidery
youngish
man
from
one
of
the
platforms
built
out
from
the
scaffold
now
became
sharply
vocal
through
a
megaphone
to
assistants
who
were
bending
the
elements
to
the
need
of
this
particular
hazard
of
hortense
he
called
directions
to
the
men
who
tugged
the
rope
to
the
men
in
control
of
the
lights
and
to
another
who
seemed
to
create
the
billows
among
other
items
he
wished
more
action
for
the
boat
and
more
water
for
the
billows
see
that
your
tank
gets
this
time
he
called
whereupon
an
engine
under
the
scaffold
by
means
of
a
large
rubber
hose
reaching
into
the
pool
began
to
suck
water
into
the
tank
above
the
speaker
must
be
miss
baxter
s
director
the
enviable
personage
who
saw
her
safely
through
her
perils
when
one
of
the
turning
reflectors
illumined
him
merton
saw
his
face
of
a
keen
semitic
type
he
seemed
to
possess
not
the
most
engaging
personality
his
manner
was
aggressive
he
spoke
rudely
to
his
doubtless
conscientious
employees
he
danced
in
little
rages
of
temper
and
altogether
he
was
not
one
with
whom
the
watcher
would
have
cared
to
come
in
contact
he
wondered
indeed
that
so
puissant
a
star
as
beulah
baxter
should
not
be
able
to
choose
her
own
director
for
surely
the
presence
of
this
unlovely
waspishly
tempered
being
could
be
nothing
but
an
irritant
in
the
daily
life
of
the
perhaps
she
had
tolerated
him
merely
for
one
picture
perhaps
he
was
especially
good
in
shipwrecks
if
merton
gill
were
in
this
company
he
would
surely
have
words
with
this
person
director
or
no
director
he
hastily
wrote
a
scenario
in
which
the
man
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
speak
sharply
to
the
star
and
in
which
a
certain
young
actor
a
new
member
of
the
company
resented
the
ungentlemanly
words
by
pitching
the
offender
into
a
convenient
pool
and
earned
even
more
than
gratitude
from
the
the
objectionable
man
continued
active
profuse
of
gesture
and
loud
through
the
megaphone
once
more
the
storm
the
boat
rocked
threateningly
the
wind
roared
through
its
slack
rigging
and
giant
billows
swept
the
frail
craft
light
as
from
a
moon
broke
through
the
mist
that
issued
from
a
steam
pipe
there
was
another
lull
and
the
semitic
type
on
the
platform
became
increasingly
offensive
merton
saw
himself
saying
allow
me
miss
baxter
to
relieve
you
of
the
presence
of
this
the
man
was
impossible
constantly
he
had
searched
the
scene
for
his
heroine
she
would
probably
not
appear
until
they
were
ready
to
shoot
and
this
seemed
not
to
be
at
once
if
the
rising
temper
of
the
director
could
be
thought
an
indication
the
big
hose
again
drew
water
from
the
pool
to
the
tank
whence
at
a
sudden
release
it
would
issue
in
billows
the
big
lights
at
last
seemed
to
be
adjusted
to
the
director
s
whim
the
aeroplane
propeller
whirred
and
the
gale
was
found
acceptable
the
men
at
the
rope
tugged
the
boat
into
grave
danger
the
moon
lighted
the
mist
that
overhung
the
scene
then
at
last
merton
started
peering
eagerly
forward
across
the
length
of
the
pool
at
the
far
end
half
illumined
by
the
big
lights
stood
the
familiar
figure
of
his
wonder
woman
the
slim
little
girl
with
the
wistful
eyes
plainly
he
could
see
her
now
as
the
mist
lifted
she
was
chatting
with
one
of
the
pirates
who
had
stepped
ashore
from
the
boat
the
wonderful
golden
hair
shone
resplendent
under
the
glancing
rays
of
the
arcs
a
cloak
was
about
her
shoulders
but
at
a
word
of
command
from
the
director
she
threw
it
off
and
stepped
to
the
boat
s
deck
she
was
dressed
in
a
short
skirt
her
trim
feet
and
ankles
lightly
shod
and
silken
clad
the
sole
maritime
touch
in
her
garb
was
a
figured
kerchief
at
her
throat
similar
to
those
worn
by
the
piratical
crew
all
ready
hortense
all
ready
jose
and
gaston
get
your
miss
baxter
acknowledged
the
command
with
that
characteristic
little
wave
of
a
hand
that
he
recalled
from
so
many
of
her
pictures
a
little
defiance
she
used
it
often
when
escaping
her
pursuers
as
if
to
say
that
she
would
see
them
in
the
next
installment
the
star
and
the
two
men
were
now
in
the
cabin
hidden
from
view
merton
gill
was
no
seaman
but
it
occurred
to
him
that
at
least
one
of
the
crew
would
be
at
the
wheel
in
this
emergency
probably
the
director
knew
no
better
indeed
the
boat
so
far
as
could
be
discerned
had
no
wheel
apparently
when
a
storm
came
up
all
hands
went
down
into
the
cabin
to
get
away
from
it
the
storm
did
come
up
at
this
moment
with
no
one
on
deck
it
struck
with
the
full
force
of
a
tropic
hurricane
the
boat
rocked
the
wind
blew
and
billows
swept
the
deck
at
the
height
of
the
tempest
beulah
baxter
sprang
from
the
cabin
to
the
deck
clutching
wildly
at
a
stanchion
buffeted
by
the
billows
she
groped
a
painful
way
along
the
side
at
risk
of
being
swept
off
to
her
death
she
was
followed
by
one
of
the
crew
who
held
a
murderous
knife
in
his
hand
then
by
the
other
sailor
who
also
held
a
knife
they
too
were
swept
by
the
billows
but
seemed
grimly
determined
upon
the
death
of
the
heroine
then
when
she
reached
midships
and
the
foremost
fiend
was
almost
upon
her
the
mightiest
of
all
the
billows
descended
and
swept
her
off
into
the
cruel
waters
her
pursuers
saving
themselves
only
by
great
effort
held
to
the
rigging
and
stared
after
the
girl
they
leaned
far
over
the
ship
s
rocking
side
and
each
looked
from
under
a
spread
hand
for
a
distressing
interval
the
heroine
battled
with
the
waves
but
her
frail
strength
availed
her
little
she
raised
a
despairing
face
for
an
instant
to
the
camera
and
its
agony
was
illumined
then
the
dread
waters
closed
above
her
the
director
s
whistle
blew
the
waves
were
stilled
the
tumult
ceased
the
head
of
beulah
baxter
appeared
halfway
down
the
tank
she
was
swimming
toward
the
end
where
merton
stood
he
had
been
thrilled
beyond
words
at
this
actual
sight
of
his
heroine
in
action
but
now
it
seemed
that
a
new
emotion
might
overcome
him
he
felt
faint
beulah
baxter
would
issue
from
the
pool
there
at
his
feet
he
might
speak
to
her
might
even
help
her
to
climb
out
at
least
no
one
else
had
appeared
to
do
this
seemingly
no
one
now
cared
where
miss
baxter
swam
to
or
whether
she
were
offered
any
assistance
in
landing
she
swam
with
an
admirable
crawl
stroke
reached
the
wall
and
put
up
a
hand
to
it
he
stepped
forward
but
she
was
out
before
he
reached
her
side
his
awe
had
delayed
him
he
drew
back
then
for
the
star
after
vigorously
shaking
herself
went
to
a
tall
brazier
in
which
glowed
a
charcoal
fire
here
he
now
noticed
for
the
first
time
the
jimmie
he
who
had
almost
certainly
defaulted
with
an
excellent
razor
jimmie
threw
a
blanket
about
the
star
s
shoulders
as
she
hovered
above
the
glowing
coals
merton
had
waited
for
her
voice
he
might
still
venture
to
speak
to
her
to
tell
her
of
his
long
and
profound
admiration
for
her
art
her
voice
came
as
she
shivered
over
the
fire
murder
that
water
s
cold
rosenblatt
swore
he
d
have
it
warmed
but
i
m
here
to
say
it
wouldn
t
boil
an
egg
in
four
he
could
not
at
first
identify
this
voice
with
the
remembered
tones
of
beulah
baxter
but
of
course
she
was
now
hoarse
with
the
cold
under
the
circumstances
he
could
hardly
expect
his
heroine
s
own
musical
clearness
then
as
the
girl
spoke
again
something
stirred
among
his
more
recent
memories
the
voice
was
still
hoarse
but
he
placed
it
now
he
approached
the
brazier
it
was
undoubtedly
the
montague
girl
she
recognized
him
even
as
she
squeezed
water
from
the
hair
of
wondrous
gold
hello
again
kid
you
re
everywhere
ain
t
you
say
wha
d
you
think
of
that
rosenblatt
man
swore
he
d
put
the
steam
into
that
water
and
take
off
the
chill
and
he
she
threw
aside
the
blanket
and
squeezed
water
from
her
garments
then
began
to
slap
her
legs
arms
and
chest
well
i
m
getting
a
gentle
glow
anyhow
wha
d
you
think
of
the
scene
it
was
good
very
well
done
he
hoped
it
didn
t
sound
patronizing
though
that
was
how
he
felt
he
believed
now
that
miss
baxter
would
have
done
it
much
better
he
ventured
a
question
but
how
about
miss
baxter
when
does
she
do
something
is
she
going
to
be
swept
off
the
boat
too
baxter
into
that
water
quit
your
kidding
but
isn
t
she
here
at
all
won
t
she
do
anything
here
listen
here
kid
why
should
she
loaf
around
on
the
set
when
she
s
paying
me
good
money
to
double
for
her
you
double
for
beulah
baxter
it
was
some
more
of
the
girl
s
nonsense
and
a
blasphemy
for
which
he
could
not
easily
forgive
her
why
not
ain
t
i
a
good
stunt
actress
i
ll
tell
the
lot
she
hasn
t
found
any
one
yet
that
can
get
away
with
her
stuff
better
than
what
i
but
she
i
heard
her
say
herself
she
never
allowed
any
one
to
double
for
her
she
wouldn
t
do
such
a
here
sounded
a
scornful
laugh
from
jimmie
the
prop

humorous
intention

began
to
obey
well
i

coffee
and
about
four
ham
sandwiches
two
for
you
and
two
for
me
that
s
a
good
sure
exclaimed
jimmie
and
was
off
merton
gill
had
been
dazed
by
these
revelations
by
the
swift
and
utter
destruction
of
his
loftiest
ideal
he
hardly
cared
to
know
now
if
beulah
baxter
were
married
it
was
the
montague
girl
who
had
most
thrilled
him
for
two
years
yet
almost
as
if
from
habit
he
heard
himself
asking
is
do
you
happen
to
know
if
beulah
baxter
is
married
baxter
married
sure
i
should
think
you
d
know
it
from
the
way
that
sig
rosenblatt
bawls
everybody
who
is
he
who
is
he
why
he
s
her
husband
of
course
he
s
beulah
that
little
director
up
on
the
platform
that
yells
so
this
unspeakable
person
to
be
actually
the
husband
of
the
the
man
he
had
supposed
she
must
find
intolerable
even
as
a
director
it
was
unthinkable
more
horrible
somehow
than
her
employment
of
a
double
in
time
he
might
have
forgiven
that
but
this
sure
that
s
her
husband
and
he
s
the
best
one
out
of
three
that
i
know
she
s
had
sig
s
a
good
scout
even
if
he
don
t
look
like
buffalo
bill
in
fact
he
s
all
right
in
spite
of
his
rough
ways
he
d
go
farther
for
you
than
most
of
the
men
on
this
lot
if
i
wanted
a
favour
i
d
go
to
sig
before
a
lot
of
christians
i
happen
to
know
and
he
s
a
bully
director
if
he
is
noisy
baxter
s
crazy
about
him
too
don
t
make
any
mistake
i
won
t
he
answered
not
knowing
what
he
said
she
shot
him
a
new
look
say
kid
as
long
as
we
re
talking
you
seem
kind
of
up
against
it
where
s
your
overcoat
a
night
like
this
and
when
did
you
last
miss
montague
miss
montague
the
director
was
calling
excuse
me
she
said
i
got
to
go
entertain
the
white
folks
she
tucked
up
the
folds
of
her
blanket
and
sped
around
the
pool
to
disappear
in
the
mazes
of
the
scaffolding
he
remained
a
moment
staring
dully
into
the
now
quiet
water
then
he
walked
swiftly
away
beulah
baxter
his
had
deceived
her
public
in
peoria
illinois
by
word
of
mouth
she
employed
a
double
at
critical
junctures
she
d
be
a
fool
not
to
the
montague
girl
had
said
and
in
private
life
having
been
unhappily
wed
twice
before
she
was
sigmund
rosenblatt
and
crazy
about
her
husband
a
little
while
ago
he
had
felt
glad
he
was
not
to
die
of
starvation
before
seeing
his
reeling
under
the
first
shock
of
his
discoveries
he
was
now
sorry
beulah
baxter
was
no
longer
his
she
was
rosenblatt
s
he
would
have
preferred
death
he
thought
before
this
revelation
chapter
xi
the
montague
girl
intervenes
he
came
to
life
the
next
morning
shivering
under
his
blankets
it
must
be
cold
outside
he
glanced
at
his
watch
and
reached
for
another
blanket
throwing
it
over
himself
and
tucking
it
in
at
the
foot
then
he
lay
down
again
to
screen
a
tense
bit
of
action
that
had
occurred
late
the
night
before
he
had
plunged
through
the
streets
for
an
hour
after
leaving
the
pool
striving
to
recover
from
the
twin
shocks
he
had
suffered
then
returning
to
his
hotel
he
became
aware
that
the
hazards
of
hortense
were
still
on
he
could
hear
the
roar
of
the
aeroplane
propeller
and
see
the
lights
over
the
low
buildings
that
lined
his
street
miserably
he
was
drawn
back
to
the
spot
where
the
most
important
of
all
his
visions
had
been
rent
to
tatters
he
went
to
the
end
of
the
pool
where
he
had
stood
before
could
he
bring
his
mind
to
utter
the
hideous
still
dissatisfied
with
the
sea
s
might
he
wanted
bigger
billows
and
meant
to
have
them
if
the
company
stayed
on
the
set
all
night
he
was
saying
as
much
with
peevish
inflections
merton
stood
warming
himself
over
the
fire
that
still
glowed
in
the
brazier
to
him
from
somewhere
beyond
the
scaffold
came
now
the
montague
girl
and
jimmie
the
girl
was
in
her
blanket
and
jimmie
bore
a
pitcher
two
tin
cups
and
a
package
of
sandwiches
they
came
to
the
fire
and
jimmie
poured
coffee
for
the
girl
he
produced
sugar
from
a
pocket
help
yourself
james
said
the
girl
and
jimmie
poured
coffee
for
himself
they
ate
sandwiches
as
they
drank
merton
drew
a
little
back
from
the
fire
the
scent
of
the
hot
coffee
threatened
to
make
him
forget
he
was
not
only
a
successful
screen
actor
but
a
gentleman
did
you
have
to
do
it
again
he
asked
i
had
to
do
it
twice
again
said
the
girl
from
over
her
tin
cup
they
re
developing
the
strips
now
then
they
ll
run
them
in
the
projection
room
and
they
won
t
suit
sig
one
little
bit
and
i
ll
have
to
do
it
some
more
i
ll
be
swimming
here
till
daylight
doth
she
now
shot
that
familiar
glance
of
appraisal
at
merton
have
a
sandwich
and
some
coffee
him
your
cup
it
was
merton
gill
s
great
moment
a
climax
to
a
drama
that
had
at
no
time
lacked
tension
superbly
he
arose
to
it
consecrated
to
his
art
clifford
armytage
gave
the
public
something
better
and
finer
he
drew
himself
up
and
spoke
lightly
clearly
with
careless
ease
no
couldn
t
eat
a
the
smile
with
which
he
accompanied
the
simple
words
might
be
enigmatic
it
might
hint
of
secret
sorrows
but
it
was
plain
enough
that
these
could
not
ever
so
distantly
relate
to
a
need
for
food
having
achieved
this
sensational
triumph
with
all
the
quietness
of
method
that
should
distinguish
the
true
artist
he
became
seized
with
stage
fright
amounting
almost
to
panic
he
was
moved
to
snatch
the
sandwich
that
jimmie
now
proffered
the
cup
that
he
had
refilled
with
coffee
yet
there
was
but
a
moment
of
confusion
again
he
wielded
an
iron
restraint
but
he
must
leave
the
stage
he
could
not
tarry
there
after
his
big
scene
especially
under
that
piercing
glance
of
the
girl
somehow
there
was
incredulity
in
it
well
i
guess
i
ll
have
to
be
going
he
remarked
jauntily
and
turned
for
his
exit
say
the
girl
halted
him
a
dozen
feet
away
say
listen
here
this
is
on
the
level
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
you
ll
be
on
the
lot
won
t
you
he
seemed
to
debate
this
momentarily
then
replied
oh
yes
i
ll
be
around
here
well
remember
now
if
i
don
t
run
into
you
you
come
down
to
that
set
where
i
was
working
see
i
got
something
to
say
to
all
right
i
ll
probably
see
you
sometime
during
the
he
had
gone
on
to
his
hotel
but
he
had
no
intention
of
seeing
the
montague
girl
on
the
morrow
nor
of
being
seen
by
her
he
would
keep
out
of
that
girl
s
way
whatever
else
he
did
she
would
ask
him
if
everything
was
jake
and
where
was
his
overcoat
and
a
lot
of
silly
questions
about
matters
that
should
not
concern
her
he
was
in
two
minds
about
the
girl
now
beneath
an
unreasonable
but
very
genuine
resentment
that
she
should
have
doubled
for
beulah
if
she
had
basely
cheated
him
of
his
most
cherished
ran
an
undercurrent
of
reluctant
but
very
profound
admiration
for
her
prowess
she
had
done
some
thrilling
things
and
seemed
to
make
nothing
of
it
through
this
admiration
there
ran
also
a
thread
of
hostility
because
he
himself
would
undoubtedly
be
afraid
to
attempt
her
lightest
exploit
not
even
the
trifling
feat
he
had
just
witnessed
for
he
had
never
learned
to
swim
but
he
clearly
knew
despite
this
confusion
that
he
was
through
with
the
girl
he
must
take
more
pains
to
avoid
her
if
met
by
chance
she
must
be
as
she
would
put
it
under
his
blankets
now
after
many
appealing
of
the
sandwich
which
jimmie
had
held
out
to
him
he
felt
almost
sorry
that
he
had
not
taken
the
girl
s
food
all
his
being
save
that
part
consecrated
to
his
art
had
cried
out
for
it
art
had
triumphed
and
now
he
was
near
to
regretting
that
it
had
not
been
beaten
down
no
good
thinking
about
it
though
he
reached
again
for
his
watch
it
was
and
time
to
be
abroad
once
more
he
folded
his
blankets
and
placed
them
on
the
pile
keeping
an
alert
glance
the
while
for
another
possible
bit
of
the
delicious
bread
he
found
nothing
of
this
sort
the
crystal
palace
hotel
was
bare
of
provender
achieving
a
discreet
retirement
from
the
hostelry
he
stood
irresolute
in
the
street
this
morning
there
was
no
genial
sun
to
warm
him
a
high
fog
overcast
the
sky
and
the
air
was
chill
at
intervals
he
shivered
violently
for
no
reason
except
that
he
had
there
last
beheld
actual
food
he
went
back
to
the
pool
evidently
rosenblatt
had
finally
been
appeased
the
place
was
deserted
and
lay
bare
and
ugly
in
the
dull
light
the
gallant
ship
of
the
night
before
was
seen
to
be
a
poor
flimsy
no
wonder
rosenblatt
had
wished
billows
to
engulf
it
and
mist
to
shroud
it
he
sat
on
a
beam
lying
at
the
ship
end
of
the
pool
and
stared
moodily
at
the
pitiful
he
rounded
his
shoulders
and
pulled
up
the
collar
of
his
coat
he
knew
he
should
be
walking
but
doubted
his
strength
the
little
walk
to
the
pool
had
made
him
strangely
breathless
he
wondered
how
long
people
were
in
starving
to
death
he
had
read
of
fasters
who
went
for
weeks
without
food
but
he
knew
he
was
not
of
this
class
he
lacked
talent
for
it
doubtless
another
day
would
finish
him
he
had
no
heart
now
for
visions
of
the
gashwiler
table
he
descended
tragically
to
recalling
that
last
meal
at
the
drug
bowl
of
soup
with
its
gracious
burden
of
rich
nourishing
catsup
he
began
to
alter
the
scenario
of
his
own
life
suppose
he
had
worked
two
more
weeks
for
gashwiler
that
would
have
given
him
thirty
dollars
suppose
he
had
worked
a
month
he
could
have
existed
a
long
time
on
sixty
dollars
suppose
he
had
even
stuck
it
out
for
one
week
dollars
at
this
moment
he
began
to
see
a
breakfast
the
sort
of
meal
to
be
ordered
by
a
hungry
man
with
fifteen
dollars
to
squander
the
shivering
seized
him
again
and
he
heard
his
teeth
rattle
he
must
move
from
this
spot
forever
now
to
be
associated
with
black
disillusion
he
arose
from
his
seat
and
was
dismayed
to
hear
a
hail
from
the
montague
girl
was
he
never
to
be
free
from
her
she
was
poised
at
a
little
distance
one
hand
raised
to
him
no
longer
the
drenched
victim
of
a
capricious
rosenblatt
but
the
beaming
joyous
figure
of
one
who
had
triumphed
over
wind
and
wave
he
went
almost
sullenly
to
her
while
she
waited
no
good
trying
to
escape
her
for
a
minute
or
so
hello
old
trouper
you
re
just
in
time
to
help
me
hunt
for
she
was
in
the
familiar
street
suit
now
a
skirt
and
jacket
of
some
rough
brown
goods
and
a
cloth
hat
that
kept
close
to
her
small
head
above
hair
that
seemed
of
no
known
shade
whatever
though
it
was
lighter
than
dark
she
flashed
a
smile
at
him
from
her
broad
mouth
as
he
came
up
though
her
knowing
gray
eyes
did
not
join
in
this
smile
he
knew
instantly
that
she
was
taking
him
in
this
girl
was
wise
beyond
her
years
he
thought
but
one
even
far
less
knowing
could
hardly
have
been
in
two
minds
about
his
present
abject
condition
the
collar
of
his
coat
did
not
entirely
hide
the
collar
beneath
it
the
beard
had
reached
its
perhaps
most
distressing
stage
of
development
and
the
suit
was
rumpled
out
of
all
the
nattiness
for
which
it
had
been
advertised
even
the
plush
hat
had
lost
its
smart
air
then
he
plainly
saw
that
the
girl
would
for
the
moment
at
least
ignore
these
phenomena
she
laughed
again
and
this
time
the
eyes
laughed
too
c
mon
over
and
help
me
hunt
for
that
bar
pin
i
lost
it
must
be
at
this
end
because
i
know
i
had
it
on
when
i
went
into
the
drink
maybe
it
s
in
the
pool
but
maybe
i
lost
it
after
i
got
out
it
s
one
of
baxter
s
that
she
wore
in
the
scene
just
ahead
of
last
night
and
she
ll
have
to
have
it
again
now
she
began
to
search
the
ground
around
the
cold
brazier
it
might
be
along
he
helped
her
look
pretty
soon
he
would
remember
an
engagement
and
get
away
the
search
at
the
end
of
the
pool
proved
fruitless
the
girl
continued
to
chatter
they
had
worked
until
before
that
grouch
of
a
rosenblatt
would
call
it
a
day
at
that
she
d
rather
do
water
stuff
than
animal
lions
lions
i
should
think
so
he
replied
to
this
dangerous
isn
t
it
oh
it
ain
t
that
they
re
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
if
you
know
em
but
they
re
so
hot
and
smelly
when
you
have
to
get
close
to
em
anything
i
really
hate
it
s
having
to
get
up
against
a
big
hot
hairy
smelly
he
murmured
a
sympathetic
phrase
and
extended
his
search
for
the
lost
pin
to
the
side
of
the
pool
almost
under
the
scaffold
he
saw
the
shine
of
precious
stones
and
called
to
her
as
he
picked
up
the
pin
a
bar
pin
splendidly
set
with
diamonds
he
was
glad
that
he
had
found
it
for
her
it
must
have
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
and
she
would
doubtless
be
held
responsible
for
its
she
came
dancing
to
him
say
that
s
eyes
are
working
ain
t
they
i
might
a
been
set
back
a
good
six
dollars
if
you
hadn
t
found
she
took
the
bauble
and
fastened
it
inside
her
jacket
so
the
pin
too
had
been
a
tawdry
makeshift
nothing
was
real
any
more
as
she
adjusted
the
pin
he
saw
his
moment
for
escape
with
a
gallant
striving
for
the
true
clifford
armytage
manner
he
raised
the
plush
hat
well
i
m
glad
you
found
rosenblatt
s
i
guess
i
ll
be
getting
the
manner
must
have
been
defective
she
looked
through
him
and
said
with
great
firmness
nothing
like
that
old
again
he
was
taken
with
a
violent
fit
of
shivering
he
could
not
meet
her
eyes
he
was
turning
away
when
she
seized
him
by
the
wrist
her
grip
was
amazingly
forceful
he
doubted
if
he
could
break
away
even
with
his
stoutest
effort
he
stood
miserably
staring
at
the
ground
suddenly
the
girl
reached
up
to
pat
his
shoulder
he
shivered
again
and
she
continued
to
pat
it
when
his
teeth
had
ceased
to
be
castanets
she
spoke
listen
here
old
kid
you
can
t
fool
any
one
so
quit
trying
don
t
you
s
pose
i
ve
seen
em
like
you
before
say
boy
i
was
trouping
while
you
played
with
marbles
you
re
up
against
it
now
c
mon
with
the
arm
at
his
shoulder
she
pulled
him
about
to
face
c
mon
and
be
mother
all
about
the
late
clifford
armytage
was
momentarily
menaced
by
a
complete
emotional
overthrow
another
paroxysm
of
shivering
perhaps
averted
this
humiliation
the
girl
dropped
his
wrist
turned
stooped
and
did
something
he
recalled
the
scene
in
the
gambling
hell
only
this
time
she
fronted
away
from
the
camera
when
she
faced
him
again
he
was
not
surprised
to
see
bills
in
her
hand
it
could
only
have
been
the
chill
he
suffered
that
kept
him
from
blushing
she
forced
the
bills
into
his
numb
fingers
and
he
stared
at
them
blankly
i
can
t
take
these
he
muttered
there
now
there
now
be
easy
naturally
i
know
you
re
all
right
or
i
wouldn
t
give
up
this
way
you
re
just
having
a
run
of
hard
luck
the
lord
knows
i
ve
been
helped
out
often
enough
in
my
time
say
listen
i
ll
never
forget
when
i
went
out
as
a
kid
with
her
first
false
had
lions
in
that
show
it
was
a
frost
from
the
start
no
salaries
no
nothing
i
got
a
big
laugh
one
day
when
i
was
late
at
rehearsal
the
manager
says
you
re
fined
two
dollars
miss
i
says
all
right
gratz
but
you
ll
have
to
wait
till
i
can
write
home
for
the
even
gratz
had
to
laugh
anyway
the
show
went
bust
and
i
never
would
a
got
any
place
if
two
or
three
parties
hadn
t
of
helped
me
out
here
and
there
just
the
same
as
i
m
doing
with
you
this
minute
so
don
t
be
don
t
he
broke
off
from
nervous
weakness
in
his
mind
was
a
jumble
of
incongruous
sentences
and
he
seemed
unable
to
manage
any
of
them
the
girl
now
sent
a
clean
shot
through
his
armour
when
d
you
eat
last
he
looked
at
the
ground
again
in
painful
embarrassment
even
in
the
chill
air
he
was
beginning
to
feel
hot
i
don
t
remember
he
said
at
last
quite
honestly
that
s
what
i
thought
you
go
eat
go
to
mother
haggin
s
that
cafeteria
just
outside
the
gate
she
has
better
breakfast
things
than
the
place
on
the
against
his
will
the
vision
of
a
breakfast
enthralled
him
yet
even
under
this
exaltation
an
instinct
of
the
wariest
caution
survived
i
ll
go
to
the
one
on
the
lot
i
guess
if
i
went
out
to
the
other
one
i
couldn
t
get
in
she
smiled
suddenly
with
puzzling
lights
in
her
eyes
well
of
all
things
you
want
to
get
in
again
do
you
say
wouldn
t
that
beat
the
hot
place
a
mile
you
want
to
get
in
again
all
right
i
ll
go
out
with
you
and
after
you
ve
fed
i
ll
cue
you
on
to
the
lot
it
ain
t
taking
you
out
of
your
he
knew
that
the
girl
was
somehow
humouring
him
as
if
he
were
a
sick
child
she
knew
and
he
knew
that
the
lot
was
no
longer
any
place
for
him
until
he
could
be
rightly
there
no
c
mon
i
ll
stay
by
they
walked
up
the
street
of
the
western
village
the
girl
had
started
at
a
brisk
pace
and
he
was
presently
breathless
i
guess
i
ll
have
to
rest
a
minute
he
said
they
were
now
before
the
crystal
palace
hotel
and
he
sat
on
the
steps
all
in
are
you
well
take
it
he
was
not
only
all
in
but
his
mind
still
played
with
incongruous
sentences
he
heard
himself
saying
things
that
must
sound
foolish
i
ve
slept
in
here
a
lot
he
volunteered
the
girl
went
to
look
through
one
of
the
windows
blankets
she
exclaimed
well
you
got
the
makings
of
a
trouper
in
you
i
ll
say
that
where
else
did
you
sleep
well
there
were
two
miners
had
a
nice
cabin
down
the
street
here
with
bunks
and
blankets
and
they
had
a
fight
and
half
a
kettle
of
beans
and
some
bread
and
one
of
them
shaved
and
i
used
his
razor
but
i
haven
t
shaved
since
because
i
only
had
twenty
cents
day
before
yesterday
and
anyway
they
might
think
i
was
growing
them
for
a
part
the
way
your
father
did
but
i
moved
up
here
when
i
saw
them
put
the
blankets
in
and
i
was
careful
and
put
them
back
every
morning
i
didn
t
do
any
harm
do
you
think
and
i
got
the
rest
of
the
beans
they
d
thrown
into
the
fireplace
and
if
i
d
only
known
it
i
could
have
brought
my
razor
and
overcoat
and
some
clean
collars
but
somehow
you
never
seem
to
know
when
he
broke
off
eyeing
her
vaguely
he
had
little
notion
what
he
had
been
saying
or
what
he
would
say
next
this
is
going
to
be
good
said
the
montague
girl
i
can
see
that
from
here
but
now
you
c
ll
walk
you
tell
me
the
rest
when
you
ve
had
a
little
she
even
helped
him
to
rise
with
a
hand
under
his
elbow
though
he
was
quick
to
show
her
that
he
had
not
needed
this
help
i
can
walk
all
right
he
assured
her
of
course
you
can
you
re
as
strong
as
a
horse
but
we
needn
t
go
too
she
took
his
arm
in
a
friendly
way
as
they
completed
the
journey
to
the
outside
cafeteria
at
this
early
hour
they
were
the
only
patrons
of
the
place
miss
montague
a
little
with
the
air
of
a
solicitous
nurse
seated
her
charge
at
a
corner
table
and
took
the
place
opposite
him
what
s
it
going
to
be
she
demanded
visions
of
rich
food
raced
madly
through
his
awakened
mind
wide
platters
heaped
with
sausage
and
steaks
and
ham
and
hash
steak
he
ventured
and
something
like
ham
and
eggs
and
some
hot
cakes
and
coffee
and
he
broke
off
he
was
becoming
too
emotional
under
this
golden
spread
of
opportunity
the
girl
glanced
up
from
the
bill
of
fare
and
appraised
the
wild
light
in
his
eyes
one
minute
s
be
more
restful
at
first
you
of
ease
into
the
heavy
eats
it
ll
prob
ly
be
better
for
anything
you
say
he
conceded
her
words
of
caution
had
stricken
him
with
a
fear
that
this
was
a
dream
that
he
would
wake
up
under
blankets
back
in
the
crystal
palace
it
was
like
that
in
dreams
you
seemed
able
to
order
all
sorts
of
food
but
something
happened
it
never
reached
the
table
he
would
take
no
further
initiative
in
this
scene
whether
dream
or
reality
you
order
something
he
concluded
his
eyes
trustfully
sought
the
girl
s
well
i
think
you
ll
start
with
one
orange
just
to
kind
of
hint
to
the
old
works
that
something
good
is
coming
then
lem
me
see
she
considered
gravely
then
i
guess
about
two
eggs
no
you
can
stand
three
and
some
dry
toast
and
some
coffee
maybe
a
few
thin
strips
of
bacon
wouldn
t
hurt
we
ll
see
can
you
make
the
she
turned
to
give
the
order
to
a
waitress
and
shoot
the
coffee
along
sister
a
cup
for
me
her
charge
shivered
again
at
the
mere
mention
of
coffee
the
juncture
was
critical
he
might
still
be
dreaming
but
in
another
moment
he
must
know
he
closely
even
coolly
watched
the
two
cups
of
coffee
that
were
placed
before
them
he
put
a
benumbed
hand
around
the
cup
in
front
of
him
and
felt
it
burn
it
was
too
active
a
sensation
for
mere
dreaming
he
put
sugar
into
the
cup
and
poured
in
the
cream
from
a
miniature
pitcher
inhaling
a
very
real
aroma
events
thus
far
seemed
normal
he
stirred
the
coffee
and
started
to
raise
the
cup
now
after
all
it
seemed
to
be
a
dream
his
hand
shook
so
that
the
stuff
spilled
into
the
saucer
and
even
out
on
to
the
table
always
in
dreams
you
were
thwarted
at
the
last
moment
the
montague
girl
had
noted
the
trembling
and
ineffective
hand
she
turned
her
back
upon
him
to
chat
with
the
waitress
over
by
the
food
counter
with
no
eye
upon
him
he
put
both
hands
about
the
cup
and
succeeded
in
raising
it
to
his
lips
the
hands
were
still
shaky
but
he
managed
some
sips
of
the
stuff
and
then
a
long
draught
that
seemed
to
scald
him
he
wasn
t
sure
if
it
scalded
or
not
it
was
pretty
hot
and
fire
ran
through
him
he
drained
the
cup
still
holding
it
with
both
hands
it
was
an
amazing
sensation
to
have
one
s
hand
refuse
to
obey
so
simple
an
order
maybe
he
would
always
be
that
way
now
practically
a
cripple
the
girl
turned
back
to
him
atta
boy
she
said
now
take
the
orange
and
when
the
toast
comes
you
can
have
some
more
a
dread
load
was
off
his
mind
he
did
not
dream
this
thing
he
ate
the
orange
and
ate
wonderful
toast
to
the
accompaniment
of
another
cup
of
coffee
the
latter
half
of
this
he
managed
with
but
one
hand
though
it
was
not
yet
wholly
under
control
the
three
eggs
seemed
like
but
one
he
thought
they
must
have
been
small
eggs
more
toast
was
commanded
and
more
coffee
easy
easy
cautioned
his
watchful
hostess
from
time
to
time
don
t
wolf
it
you
ll
feel
better
i
feel
better
already
he
announced
well
the
girl
eyed
him
critically
you
certainly
got
the
main
chandelier
lighted
up
once
a
strange
exhilaration
flooded
all
his
being
his
own
thoughts
babbled
to
him
and
he
presently
began
to
babble
to
his
new
friend
you
remind
me
so
much
of
tessie
kearns
he
said
as
he
scraped
the
sides
of
the
egg
cup
who
s
she
oh
she
s
a
scenario
writer
i
know
you
re
just
like
he
was
now
drunk
maudlin
drunk
from
the
coffee
sober
he
would
have
known
that
no
human
beings
could
be
less
alike
than
tessie
kearns
and
the
montague
girl
other
walls
of
his
reserve
went
down
of
course
i
could
have
written
to
gashwiler
and
got
some
money
to
go
back
there
gashwiler
gashwiler
the
girl
seemed
to
search
her
memory
i
thought
i
knew
all
the
tank
towns
but
that
s
a
new
one
where
is
it
it
isn
t
a
town
it
s
a
gentleman
i
had
a
position
with
and
he
said
he
d
keep
it
open
for
he
flew
to
another
thought
with
the
inconsequence
of
the
drunken
say
kid
he
had
even
caught
that
form
of
address
from
her
i
ll
tell
you
you
can
keep
this
watch
of
mine
till
i
pay
you
back
this
he
drew
it
out
it
s
a
good
watch
and
everything
my
uncle
sylvester
gave
it
to
me
for
not
smoking
on
my
eighteenth
birthday
he
smoked
himself
he
even
drank
considerable
he
was
his
own
worst
enemy
but
you
can
see
it
s
a
good
solid
gold
watch
and
keeps
time
and
you
hold
it
till
i
pay
you
back
will
you
the
girl
took
the
watch
examining
it
carefully
noting
the
inscription
engraved
on
the
case
there
were
puzzling
glints
in
her
eyes
as
she
handed
it
back
to
him
no
i
ll
tell
you
it
ll
be
my
watch
until
you
pay
me
back
but
you
keep
it
for
me
i
haven
t
any
place
to
carry
it
except
the
pocket
of
my
jacket
and
i
might
lose
it
and
then
where
d
we
be
well
all
he
cheerfully
took
back
the
watch
his
present
ecstasy
would
find
him
agreeable
to
all
proposals
and
say
continued
the
girl
what
about
this
gashweiler
or
whatever
his
name
is
he
said
he
d
take
you
back
did
he
a
farm
no
an
emporium
and
you
forgot
his
name
just
the
way
that
lady
in
the
casting
office
always
does
she
s
funny
keeps
telling
me
not
to
forget
the
address
when
of
course
i
couldn
t
forget
the
town
where
i
lived
could
i
of
course
it
s
a
little
town
but
you
wouldn
t
forget
it
when
you
lived
there
a
long
time
not
when
you
got
your
start
so
you
got
your
start
in
this
town
did
you
he
wanted
to
talk
a
lot
now
he
prattled
of
the
town
and
his
life
there
of
the
and
the
course
in
of
tessie
kearns
and
her
scenarios
not
yet
prized
as
they
were
sure
to
be
later
of
lowell
hardy
the
artistic
photographer
and
the
stills
that
he
had
made
of
the
speaker
as
clifford
armytage
didn
t
she
think
that
was
a
better
stage
name
than
merton
gill
which
didn
t
seem
to
sound
like
so
much
anyway
he
wished
he
had
his
stills
here
to
show
her
of
course
some
of
them
were
just
in
society
parts
the
sort
of
thing
that
harold
parmalee
played
had
she
noticed
that
he
looked
a
good
deal
like
harold
parmalee
lots
of
people
had
tessie
kearns
thought
he
was
the
dead
image
of
parmalee
but
he
liked
western
stuff
better
a
lot
better
than
cabaret
stuff
where
you
had
to
smoke
one
cigarette
after
another
and
he
wished
she
could
see
the
stills
in
the
buck
benson
outfit
chaps
and
sombrero
and
spurs
and
holster
he
d
never
had
two
guns
but
the
one
he
did
have
he
could
draw
pretty
well
there
would
be
his
hand
at
his
side
and
in
a
flash
he
would
have
the
gun
in
it
ready
to
shoot
from
the
hip
and
roping
he
d
need
to
practise
that
some
once
he
got
it
smack
over
dexter
s
head
but
usually
it
didn
t
go
so
well
probably
a
new
clothesline
didn
t
make
the
best
rope
too
stiff
he
could
probably
do
a
lot
better
with
one
of
those
hair
ropes
that
the
real
cowboys
used
and
metta
judson
she
was
the
best
cook
anywhere
around
simsbury
he
mustn
t
forget
to
write
to
metta
and
to
tessie
kearns
to
be
sure
and
see
the
blight
of
broadway
when
it
came
to
the
bijou
palace
they
would
be
surprised
to
see
those
close
ups
that
henshaw
had
used
him
in
and
he
was
in
that
other
picture
no
in
that
still
he
would
show
pretty
well
in
the
he
d
had
to
smoke
a
few
cigarettes
there
because
arabs
smoke
all
the
time
and
he
hadn
t
been
in
the
later
scene
where
the
girl
and
the
young
fellow
were
in
the
deserted
tomb
all
night
and
he
didn
t
lay
a
finger
on
her
because
he
was
a
perfect
gentleman
he
didn
t
know
what
he
would
do
next
maybe
henshaw
would
want
him
in
robinson
crusoe
junior
where
friday
s
sister
turned
out
to
be
the
daughter
of
an
english
earl
with
her
monogram
tattooed
on
her
left
shoulder
he
would
ask
henshaw
anyway
the
montague
girl
listened
attentively
to
the
long
wandering
recital
at
times
she
would
seem
to
be
strongly
moved
to
tears
or
something
but
mostly
she
listened
with
a
sympathetic
smile
or
perhaps
with
a
perfectly
rigid
face
though
at
such
moments
there
would
be
those
curious
glints
of
light
far
back
in
her
gray
eyes
occasionally
she
would
prompt
him
with
a
question
in
this
way
she
brought
out
his
version
of
the
sabbath
afternoon
experience
with
dexter
he
spared
none
of
the
details
for
he
was
all
frankness
now
he
even
told
how
ashamed
he
had
felt
having
to
lead
dexter
home
from
his
scandalous
grazing
before
the
methodist
church
he
had
longed
to
leap
upon
the
horse
and
ride
him
back
at
a
gallop
but
he
had
been
unable
to
do
this
because
there
was
nothing
from
which
to
climb
on
him
and
probably
he
would
have
been
afraid
to
gallop
the
beast
anyway
this
had
been
one
of
the
bits
that
most
strangely
moved
his
listener
her
eyes
were
moist
when
he
had
finished
and
some
strong
emotion
seemed
about
to
overpower
her
but
she
had
recovered
command
of
herself
and
become
again
the
sympathetic
provider
and
counsellor
he
would
have
continued
to
talk
apparently
for
the
influence
of
strong
drink
had
not
begun
to
wane
but
the
girl
at
length
stopped
him
listen
here
merton
she
began
her
voice
was
choked
to
a
peculiar
hoarseness
and
she
seemed
to
be
threatened
with
a
return
of
her
late
strong
emotion
she
was
plainly
uncertain
of
her
control
fearing
to
trust
herself
to
speech
but
presently
after
efforts
which
he
observed
with
warmest
sympathy
she
seemed
to
recover
her
poise
she
swallowed
earnestly
several
times
wiped
her
moisture
dimmed
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
and
continued
it
s
getting
late
and
i
ve
got
to
be
over
at
the
show
shop
so
i
ll
tell
you
what
to
do
next
you
go
out
and
get
a
shave
and
a
haircut
and
then
go
home
and
get
cleaned
up
you
said
you
had
a
room
and
other
clothes
didn
t
you
volubly
he
told
her
about
the
room
at
patterson
s
and
with
a
brief
return
of
lucidity
how
the
sum
of
ten
dollars
was
now
due
this
heartless
society
woman
who
might
insist
upon
its
payment
before
he
would
again
enjoy
free
access
to
his
excellent
wardrobe
well
lem
me
see
she
debated
a
moment
then
reached
under
the
table
fumbled
obscurely
and
came
up
with
more
money
now
here
here
s
twenty
more
besides
that
first
i
gave
you
so
you
can
pay
the
dame
her
money
and
get
all
fixed
up
again
fresh
suit
and
clean
collar
and
a
shine
and
everything
no
no
this
is
my
scene
you
stay
he
had
waved
protestingly
at
sight
of
the
new
money
and
now
again
he
blushed
that
s
all
understood
she
continued
i
m
staking
you
to
cakes
till
you
get
on
your
feet
see
and
i
know
you
re
honest
so
i
m
not
throwing
my
money
away
there
sink
it
and
forget
it
now
you
go
out
and
do
what
i
said
the
barber
first
and
lay
off
the
eats
until
about
noon
you
had
enough
for
now
by
noon
you
can
stoke
up
with
meat
and
potatoes
anything
you
want
that
ll
stick
to
the
merry
old
slats
and
i
d
take
milk
instead
of
any
more
coffee
you
ve
thinned
down
some
you
re
not
near
so
plump
as
harold
parmalee
then
you
rest
up
for
the
balance
of
the
day
and
you
show
here
morning
about
this
time
do
you
get
it
the
countess
ll
let
you
in
tell
her
i
said
to
and
come
over
to
the
office
building
see
he
tried
to
tell
her
his
gratitude
but
instead
he
babbled
again
of
how
much
she
was
like
tessie
kearns
they
parted
at
the
gate
with
a
last
wondering
scrutiny
of
him
a
last
reminder
of
her
very
minute
directions
she
suddenly
illumined
him
with
rays
of
a
compassion
that
was
somehow
you
poor
feckless
dub
she
pronounced
as
she
turned
from
him
to
dance
through
the
gate
he
scarcely
heard
the
words
her
look
and
tone
had
been
so
warming
ten
minutes
later
he
was
telling
a
barber
that
he
had
just
finished
a
hard
week
on
the
holden
lot
and
that
he
was
glad
to
get
the
brush
off
at
last
from
the
barber
s
he
hastened
to
the
patterson
house
rather
dreading
the
encounter
with
one
to
whom
he
owed
so
much
money
he
found
the
house
locked
probably
both
of
the
pattersons
had
gone
out
into
society
he
let
himself
in
and
began
to
follow
the
directions
of
the
montague
girl
the
bath
clean
linen
the
other
belted
suit
already
pressed
the
other
shoes
the
buttoned
ones
already
polished
he
felt
now
more
equal
to
the
encounter
with
a
heartless
society
woman
but
as
she
did
not
return
he
went
out
in
obedience
to
a
new
hunger
in
the
most
sumptuous
cafeteria
he
knew
of
one
patronized
only
in
his
first
careless
days
of
opulence
he
ate
for
a
long
time
roast
beef
and
potatoes
he
ordered
twice
nor
did
he
forget
to
drink
the
milk
prescribed
by
his
benefactress
plenty
of
milk
would
make
him
more
than
ever
resemble
harold
parmalee
and
he
commanded
an
abundance
of
dessert
lemon
pie
and
apple
pie
and
a
double
portion
of
chocolate
cake
with
his
craving
for
sweets
was
still
unappeased
so
at
a
drug
store
he
bought
a
pound
box
of
candy
the
world
was
again
under
his
feet
restored
to
his
rightful
domain
he
trod
it
with
lightness
and
certainty
his
mind
was
still
a
pleasant
jumble
of
money
and
food
and
the
montague
girl
miles
of
gorgeous
film
flickered
across
his
vision
an
experienced
alcoholic
would
have
told
him
that
he
enjoyed
a
coffee
he
wended
a
lordly
way
to
the
nearest
theatre
billed
there
was
the
tenth
installment
of
the
hazards
of
hortense
he
passed
before
the
lively
portrayal
in
colours
of
hortense
driving
a
motor
car
off
an
open
drawbridge
the
car
was
already
halfway
between
the
bridge
and
the
water
beneath
he
sneered
openly
at
the
announcement
beulah
baxter
in
the
sensational
surprise
picture
of
the
a
surprise
picture
indeed
if
those
now
entering
the
theatre
could
be
told
what
he
knew
about
it
he
considered
spreading
the
news
but
decided
to
retain
the
superiority
his
secret
knowledge
gave
him
inside
the
theatre
eating
diligently
from
his
box
of
candy
he
was
compelled
to
endure
another
of
the
unspeakable
buckeye
comedies
the
man
was
a
lifeguard
at
a
beach
and
there
were
social
entanglements
involving
a
bearded
father
his
daughter
in
an
inconsiderable
bathing
suit
a
confirmed
dipsomaniac
two
social
derelicts
who
had
to
live
by
their
wits
and
a
dozen
young
girls
also
arrayed
in
inconsiderable
bathing
suits
he
could
scarcely
follow
the
chain
of
events
so
illogical
were
they
and
indeed
made
little
effort
to
do
so
he
felt
far
above
the
audience
that
cackled
at
these
dreadful
buffooneries
one
subtitle
read
i
hate
to
kill
him
murder
is
so
hard
to
this
sort
of
thing
he
felt
more
than
ever
degraded
an
art
where
earnest
people
were
suffering
and
sacrificing
in
order
to
give
the
public
something
better
and
finer
had
he
not
himself
that
very
day
completed
a
perilous
ordeal
of
suffering
and
sacrifice
and
he
was
asked
to
laugh
at
a
cross
eyed
man
posing
before
a
camera
that
fell
to
pieces
when
the
lens
was
exposed
shattered
presumably
by
the
impact
of
the
afflicted
creature
s
image
this
surely
was
not
art
such
as
clifford
armytage
was
rapidly
fitting
himself
by
trial
and
hardship
to
confer
upon
the
public
it
was
with
curiously
conflicting
emotions
that
he
watched
the
ensuing
hazards
of
hortense
he
had
to
remind
himself
that
the
slim
little
girl
with
the
wistful
eyes
was
not
only
not
performing
certain
feats
of
daring
that
the
film
exposed
but
that
she
was
sigmund
rosenblatt
and
crazy
about
her
husband
yet
the
magic
had
not
wholly
departed
from
this
wronged
heroine
he
thought
perhaps
this
might
be
because
he
now
knew
and
actually
liked
that
talkative
montague
girl
who
would
be
doing
the
choice
bits
of
this
drama
certainly
he
was
loyal
to
the
hand
that
fed
him
black
steve
and
his
base
crew
hirelings
of
the
scoundrelly
guardian
who
was
a
power
in
wall
street
again
and
again
seemed
to
have
encompassed
the
ruin
body
and
soul
of
the
persecuted
hortense
they
had
her
prisoner
in
a
foul
den
of
chinatown
whence
she
escaped
to
balance
precariously
upon
the
narrow
cornice
of
a
skyscraper
hundreds
of
feet
above
a
crowded
thoroughfare
they
had
her
as
the
screen
said
depressed
by
the
grim
menace
of
tragedy
that
impended
in
the
they
gave
her
a
brief
respite
in
one
of
those
gilded
resorts
where
the
clink
of
coin
opens
wide
the
portals
of
pleasure
where
wealth
beckons
with
golden
fingers
but
this
was
only
a
trap
for
the
unsuspecting
girl
who
was
presently
sewed
in
a
plain
sack
tossed
from
the
stern
of
an
ocean
liner
far
out
at
sea
by
creatures
who
would
do
anything
for
money
who
so
it
was
said
were
remorseless
in
the
mad
pursuit
of
gain
at
certain
gripping
moments
it
became
apparent
to
one
of
the
audience
that
sigmund
rosenblatt
herself
was
no
longer
in
jeopardy
he
knew
the
girl
who
was
and
profoundly
admired
her
artistry
as
she
fled
along
the
narrow
cornice
of
the
skyscraper
for
all
purposes
she
was
beulah
baxter
he
recalled
her
figure
as
being
not
exactly
stubby
but
at
least
not
of
marked
slenderness
yet
in
the
distance
she
was
indeed
all
that
an
audience
could
demand
and
she
was
honest
while
rosenblatt
in
the
majestic
theatre
at
peoria
illinois
had
trifled
airily
with
his
faith
in
women
and
deceived
him
by
word
of
mouth
he
applauded
loudly
at
the
sensational
finish
when
hortense
driving
her
motor
car
at
high
speed
across
the
great
bridge
ran
into
the
draw
that
opened
too
late
for
her
to
slow
down
and
plunged
to
the
cruel
waters
far
below
rosenblatt
would
possibly
have
been
a
fool
to
do
this
herself
the
montague
girl
had
been
insistent
on
that
point
there
were
enough
things
she
couldn
t
avoid
doing
and
all
stars
very
sensibly
had
doubles
for
such
scenes
when
distance
or
action
permitted
at
the
same
time
he
could
never
again
feel
the
same
toward
her
indeed
he
would
never
have
felt
the
same
even
had
there
been
no
rosenblatt
art
was
art
it
was
only
five
o
clock
when
he
left
the
picture
theatre
but
he
ate
again
at
the
luxurious
cafeteria
he
ate
a
large
steak
drank
an
immense
quantity
of
milk
and
bought
another
box
of
candy
on
his
way
to
the
patterson
home
lights
were
on
there
and
he
went
in
to
face
the
woman
he
had
so
long
kept
out
of
her
money
she
would
probably
greet
him
coldly
and
tell
him
she
was
surprised
at
his
actions
yet
it
seemed
that
he
had
been
deceived
in
this
society
woman
she
was
human
after
all
she
shook
hands
with
him
warmly
and
said
they
were
glad
to
see
him
back
he
must
have
been
out
on
location
and
she
was
glad
they
were
not
to
lose
him
because
he
was
so
quiet
and
regular
and
not
like
some
other
actors
she
had
known
he
told
her
he
had
just
put
in
a
hard
week
on
the
holden
lot
where
things
were
beginning
to
pick
up
he
was
glad
she
had
missed
him
and
he
certainly
had
missed
his
comfortable
room
because
the
accommodations
on
the
lot
were
not
of
the
best
in
fact
they
were
pretty
unsatisfactory
if
you
came
right
down
to
it
and
he
hoped
they
wouldn
t
keep
him
there
again
and
oh
yes
he
was
almost
forgetting
here
was
ten
dollars
he
believed
there
were
two
weeks
rent
now
due
he
passed
over
the
money
with
rather
a
clifford
armytage
flourish
patterson
accepted
the
bill
almost
protestingly
she
hadn
t
once
thought
about
the
rent
because
she
knew
he
was
reliable
and
he
was
to
remember
that
any
time
convenient
to
him
would
always
suit
her
in
these
matters
she
did
accept
the
bill
still
she
was
not
the
heartless
creature
he
had
supposed
her
to
be
as
he
bade
her
at
the
door
she
regarded
him
closely
and
said
somehow
you
look
a
whole
lot
older
i
am
replied
armytage
miss
montague
after
parting
with
her
protege
had
walked
quickly
not
without
little
recurrent
dance
steps
as
if
some
excess
of
joy
would
ever
and
again
overwhelm
her
to
the
long
office
building
on
the
holden
lot
where
she
entered
a
door
marked
buckeye
comedies
jeff
baird
the
outer
office
was
vacant
but
through
the
open
door
to
another
room
she
observed
baird
at
his
desk
his
head
bent
low
over
certain
sheets
of
yellow
paper
he
was
a
bulky
rather
phlegmatic
looking
man
with
a
crest
of
gray
hair
he
did
not
look
up
as
the
girl
entered
she
stood
a
moment
as
if
to
control
her
excitement
then
spoke
jeff
i
found
a
million
dollars
for
you
this
thanks
said
baird
still
not
looking
up
chuck
it
down
in
the
coal
cellar
will
you
we
re
littered
with
the
stuff
up
on
the
level
baird
looked
up
on
the
level
you
ll
say
shoot
well
he
s
a
hick
that
saved
up
dollars
to
come
here
from
goosewallow
michigan
to
go
into
a
correspondence
course
in
screen
acting
and
all
that
and
he
went
broke
and
slept
in
a
property
room
down
in
the
village
all
last
week
no
eats
at
all
for
three
four
days
i
d
noticed
him
around
the
lot
on
different
sets
something
about
him
that
makes
you
look
a
second
time
i
don
t
know
what
it
of
innocent
and
the
way
he
d
rubber
at
things
but
all
the
time
like
as
if
he
thought
he
was
someone
well
i
keep
running
across
him
and
pretty
soon
i
notice
he
s
up
against
it
he
still
thinks
he
s
someone
and
is
very
if
you
start
to
kid
him
the
least
bit
but
the
signs
are
there
all
right
he
s
up
against
it
good
and
hard
all
last
week
he
got
to
looking
worse
and
worse
but
he
still
had
his
stage
presence
say
yesterday
he
looked
like
the
juvenile
lead
of
a
busted
road
show
that
has
walked
in
from
albany
and
was
just
standing
around
on
broadway
wondering
who
he
d
consent
to
sign
up
with
for
forty
weeks
see
what
i
mean
but
proud
he
was
over
on
the
baxter
set
last
night
while
i
was
doing
the
water
stuff
and
you
d
ought
to
see
him
freeze
me
when
i
suggested
a
sandwich
and
a
cup
o
coffee
it
was
grand
well
this
morning
i
m
back
for
a
bar
pin
of
baxter
s
i
d
lost
and
there
he
is
again
no
overcoat
shivering
his
teeth
loose
and
all
in
so
i
fell
for
him
took
him
up
for
some
coffee
and
eggs
staked
him
to
his
room
rent
and
sent
him
off
to
get
cleaned
and
barbered
but
before
he
went
he
cut
loose
and
told
me
his
history
from
the
cradle
to
hollywood
i
d
a
given
something
good
if
you
d
been
at
the
next
table
i
guess
he
got
kind
of
jagged
on
the
food
see
he
d
tell
me
anything
that
run
in
his
mind
and
most
of
it
was
good
you
ll
say
so
i
ll
get
him
to
do
it
for
you
sometime
of
all
the
funny
nuts
that
make
this
lot
well
take
my
word
for
it
that
s
all
i
ask
and
listen
here
jeff
i
m
down
to
cases
there
s
something
about
this
kid
like
when
i
tell
you
i
d
always
look
at
him
twice
and
it
s
something
rich
that
i
won
t
let
out
for
a
minute
or
two
but
here
s
what
you
and
me
do
right
quick
the
kid
was
in
that
cabaret
and
stuff
they
shot
last
week
for
the
blight
of
broadway
and
this
something
that
makes
you
look
at
him
must
of
struck
henshaw
the
way
it
did
me
for
he
let
him
stay
right
at
the
edge
of
the
dance
floor
and
took
a
lot
of
of
him
looking
tired
to
death
of
the
gay
night
life
well
you
call
up
the
victor
folks
and
ask
can
you
get
a
look
at
that
stuff
because
you
re
thinking
of
giving
a
part
to
one
of
the
extras
that
worked
in
it
maybe
we
can
get
into
the
projection
room
right
away
and
you
ll
see
what
i
mean
then
i
won
t
have
to
tell
you
the
richest
thing
about
it
now
she
took
a
long
breath
will
you
baird
had
listened
with
mild
interest
to
the
recital
occasionally
seeming
not
to
listen
while
he
altered
the
script
before
him
but
he
took
the
telephone
receiver
from
its
hook
and
said
briefly
to
the
girl
you
win
hello
give
me
the
victor
office
hello
baird
speaking
the
two
were
presently
in
the
dark
projection
room
watching
the
scenes
the
girl
had
told
of
they
haven
t
started
cutting
yet
she
said
delightedly
all
his
will
be
in
goody
there
s
the
him
ain
t
he
the
actin
est
thing
you
ever
saw
now
ll
see
baird
watched
the
film
absorbedly
three
times
it
was
run
for
the
sole
purpose
of
exposing
to
this
small
audience
merton
gill
s
notion
of
being
consumed
with
ennui
among
pleasures
that
had
palled
in
the
bit
it
could
be
observed
that
he
thought
not
too
well
of
cigarettes
he
screens
well
too
remarked
the
girl
of
course
i
couldn
t
be
sure
of
he
screens
all
right
agreed
baird
well
what
do
you
think
i
think
he
looks
like
the
first
plume
on
a
he
looks
all
of
that
but
try
again
who
does
he
remind
you
of
catch
this
next
one
in
the
gambling
hell
get
the
profile
and
the
eyebrows
and
the
chin
there
why
baird
chuckled
i
m
a
swede
if
he
don
t
look
like
you
got
it
the
girl
broke
in
excitedly
i
knew
you
would
i
didn
t
at
first
this
morning
because
he
was
so
hungry
and
needed
a
shave
and
he
darned
near
had
me
bawling
when
he
couldn
t
hold
his
cup
o
coffee
except
with
two
hands
but
what
d
you
think
pretty
soon
he
tells
me
himself
that
he
looks
a
great
deal
like
harold
parmalee
and
wouldn
t
mind
playing
parts
like
parmalee
though
he
prefers
western
stuff
wouldn
t
that
get
you
the
film
was
run
again
so
that
baird
could
study
the
gill
face
in
the
light
of
this
new
knowledge
he
does
he
does
he
certainly
does
if
he
don
t
look
like
a
no
company
of
parmalee
i
ll
eat
that
film
say
flips
you
did
find
oh
i
knew
it
didn
t
i
tell
you
so
but
listen
does
he
know
he
s
funny
not
in
a
thousand
years
he
doesn
t
know
anything
s
funny
near
as
i
can
make
they
were
out
in
the
light
again
walking
slowly
back
to
the
buckeye
offices
get
this
said
baird
seriously
you
may
think
i
m
kidding
but
only
yesterday
i
was
trying
to
think
if
i
couldn
t
dig
up
some
guy
that
looked
more
like
parmalee
than
parmalee
himself
does
just
enough
more
to
get
the
laugh
see
and
you
spring
this
lad
on
me
all
he
needs
is
the
eyebrows
worked
up
a
little
bit
but
how
about
him
will
he
handle
because
if
he
will
i
ll
use
him
in
the
new
will
he
handle
miss
montague
echoed
the
words
with
deep
emphasis
leave
him
to
me
he
s
got
to
handle
i
already
got
bucks
invested
in
his
screen
career
and
jeff
he
ll
be
easy
to
work
except
he
don
t
know
he
s
funny
if
he
found
out
he
was
it
might
queer
him
see
what
i
mean
he
s
one
of
that
kind
you
can
tell
it
how
will
you
use
him
he
could
never
do
buckeye
sure
not
but
ain
t
i
told
you
in
this
new
piece
jack
is
stage
struck
and
gets
a
job
as
valet
to
a
ham
that
s
just
about
parmalee
s
type
and
we
show
parmalee
acting
in
the
screen
but
all
straight
stuff
you
understand
unless
he
s
a
wise
guy
he
ll
go
all
through
the
piece
and
never
get
on
that
it
s
funny
see
his
part
s
dead
straight
and
serious
in
a
regular
drama
and
the
less
he
thinks
he
s
funny
the
bigger
scream
he
ll
be
he
s
got
to
be
harold
parmalee
acting
right
out
all
over
the
set
as
serious
as
the
lumbago
get
what
i
mean
i
got
you
said
the
girl
and
you
ll
get
him
morning
i
told
him
to
be
over
with
his
stills
and
he
ll
be
serious
all
the
time
make
no
mistake
there
he
s
no
wise
guy
and
one
thing
jeff
he
s
as
innocent
as
a
cup
custard
so
you
ll
have
to
keep
that
bunch
of
buckeye
roughnecks
from
riding
him
i
can
tell
you
that
much
once
they
started
kidding
him
it
would
be
all
and
besides
she
hesitated
briefly
somehow
i
don
t
want
him
kidded
i
m
pretty
but
he
sort
of
made
me
feel
like
a
mother
watching
her
only
boy
go
out
into
the
rough
world
see
i
ll
watch
out
for
that
said
baird
chapter
xii
alias
harold
parmalee
merton
gill
awoke
to
the
comforting
realization
that
he
was
between
sheets
instead
of
blankets
and
that
this
morning
he
need
not
obscurely
leave
his
room
by
means
of
a
window
as
he
dressed
however
certain
misgivings
to
which
he
had
been
immune
the
day
before
gnawed
into
his
optimism
he
was
sober
now
the
sheer
intoxication
of
food
after
fasting
of
friendly
concern
after
so
long
a
period
when
no
one
had
spoken
him
kindly
or
otherwise
had
evaporated
he
felt
the
depression
following
success
he
had
been
rescued
from
death
by
starvation
but
had
anything
more
than
this
come
about
had
he
not
fed
upon
the
charity
of
a
strange
girl
taking
her
money
without
seeing
ways
to
discharge
the
debt
how
could
he
ever
discharge
it
probably
before
this
she
had
begun
to
think
of
him
as
a
cheat
she
had
asked
him
to
come
to
the
lot
but
had
been
vague
as
to
the
purpose
probably
his
ordeal
of
struggle
and
sacrifice
was
not
yet
over
at
any
rate
he
must
find
a
job
that
would
let
him
pay
back
the
borrowed
dollars
he
would
meet
her
as
she
had
requested
assure
her
of
his
honest
intentions
and
then
seek
for
work
he
would
try
all
the
emporiums
in
hollywood
they
were
numerous
and
some
one
of
them
would
need
the
services
of
an
experienced
assistant
this
plan
of
endeavour
crystallized
as
he
made
his
way
to
the
holden
lot
he
had
brought
his
package
of
stills
but
only
because
the
girl
had
insisted
on
seeing
them
the
countess
made
nothing
of
letting
him
in
she
had
missed
him
she
said
for
what
seemed
like
months
and
was
glad
to
hear
that
he
now
had
something
definite
in
view
because
the
picture
game
was
mighty
uncertain
and
it
was
only
the
lucky
few
nowadays
that
could
see
something
definite
he
did
not
confide
to
her
that
the
definite
something
now
within
his
view
would
demand
his
presence
at
some
distance
from
her
friendly
self
he
approached
the
entrance
to
stage
five
with
head
bent
in
calculation
and
not
until
he
heard
her
voice
did
he
glance
up
to
observe
that
the
montague
girl
was
dancing
from
pleasure
it
would
seem
at
merely
beholding
him
she
seized
both
his
hands
in
her
strong
grasp
and
revolved
him
at
the
centre
of
a
circle
she
danced
then
she
held
him
off
while
her
eyes
took
in
the
details
of
his
restoration
well
well
well
that
shows
what
a
few
ham
and
eggs
and
sleep
will
do
kid
you
gross
a
million
at
this
minute
new

new
shoes

cravat
right
from
the
men
s
quality
shop
and
all
shaved
and
combed
slick
and
everything
say
and
i
was
afraid
maybe
you
wouldn
t
he
regarded
her
earnestly
oh
i
would
have
come
back
all
right
i
d
never
forget
that
dollars
i
owe
you
and
you
ll
get
it
all
back
only
it
may
take
a
little
time
i
thought
i
d
see
you
for
a
minute
then
go
out
and
find
a
job
you
know
a
regular
job
in
a
nothing
of
the
sort
old
trouper
she
danced
again
about
him
both
his
hands
in
hers
which
annoyed
him
because
it
was
rather
loud
public
behaviour
though
he
forgave
her
in
the
light
of
youth
and
kindliness
no
regular
job
for
you
old
pippin
nothing
but
acting
all
over
the
place
real
acting

a
part
perhaps
the
creature
had
something
definite
in
view
for
him
sure
you
can
get
a
part
yesterday
morning
i
simply
walked
into
a
part
for
you
come
along
over
to
the
office
with
me
goody
i
see
you
brought
the
stills
i
ll
take
a
peek
at
em
myself
before
baird
gets
baird
not
the
buckeye
comedy
man
he
was
chilled
by
a
sudden
fear
yes
jeff
baird
you
see
he
is
going
to
do
some
five
reelers
and
this
first
one
has
a
part
that
might
do
for
you
at
least
i
told
him
some
things
about
you
and
he
thinks
you
can
get
away
with
he
went
moodily
at
her
side
thinking
swift
thoughts
it
seemed
ungracious
to
tell
her
of
his
loathing
for
the
buckeye
comedies
those
blasphemous
caricatures
of
screen
art
it
would
not
be
fair
and
perhaps
here
was
a
quick
way
to
discharge
his
debt
and
be
free
of
obligation
to
the
girl
of
course
he
would
always
feel
a
warm
gratitude
for
her
trusting
kindness
but
when
he
no
longer
owed
her
money
he
could
choose
his
own
line
of
work
rather
bondage
to
some
hollywood
gashwiler
than
clowning
in
baird
s
infamies
well
i
ll
try
anything
he
gives
me
he
said
at
last
striving
for
the
enthusiasm
he
could
not
feel
you
ll
go
big
too
said
the
girl
believe
me
kid
you
ll
go
in
baird
s
offices
he
sat
at
the
desk
and
excitedly
undid
the
package
of
stills
we
ll
give
em
the
before
he
comes
she
said
and
was
presently
exclaiming
with
delight
at
the
art
study
of
clifford
armytage
in
evening
dress
two
straight
fingers
pressing
the
left
temple
the
face
in
view
well
now
if
that
ain
t
harold
parmalee
to
the
life
if
it
wasn
t
for
that
clifford
armytage
signed
under
it
you
d
had
me
guessing
i
knew
yesterday
you
looked
like
him
but
i
didn
t
dream
it
would
be
as
much
like
him
as
this
picture
is
say
we
won
t
show
baird
this
at
first
we
ll
let
him
size
you
up
and
see
if
your
face
don
t
remind
him
of
parmalee
right
away
then
we
ll
show
him
this
and
it
ll
be
a
cinch
and
my
look
at
these
others
here
you
re
a
soldier
and
here
you
re
polo
player
that
is
polo
ain
t
it
or
is
it
tennis
and
will
you
look
at
these
stunning
westerns
these
are
simply
the
best
of
all
on
horseback
and
throwing
a
rope
and
the
fighting
face
with
the
gun
drawn
and
rolling
a
cigarette
and
as
i
live
saying
to
the
horse
wouldn
t
that
get
you
buck
benson
to
the
life
again
and
again
she
shuffled
over
the
stills
dwelling
on
each
with
excited
admiration
her
excitement
was
pronounced
it
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
nervous
excitement
it
had
caused
her
face
to
flush
deeply
and
her
manner
especially
over
the
western
pictures
at
moments
oddly
approached
hysteria
merton
was
deeply
gratified
he
had
expected
the
art
studies
to
produce
no
such
impression
as
this
the
countess
in
the
casting
office
had
certainly
manifested
nothing
like
hysteria
at
beholding
them
it
must
be
that
the
montague
girl
was
a
better
judge
of
art
studies
i
always
liked
this
one
after
the
westerns
he
observed
indicating
the
harold
parmalee
pose
it
s
stunning
agreed
the
girl
still
with
her
nervous
manner
i
tell
you
sit
over
there
in
jeff
s
chair
and
take
the
same
pose
so
i
can
compare
you
with
the
merton
obliged
he
leaned
an
elbow
on
the
and
a
temple
on
the
two
straightened
fingers
is
the
light
right
he
asked
as
he
turned
his
face
to
the
pictured
angle
fine
applauded
the
girl
hold
he
held
it
until
shocked
by
shrill
laughter
from
the
observer
peal
followed
peal
she
had
seemed
oddly
threatened
with
hysteria
perhaps
now
it
had
come
she
rocked
on
her
heels
and
held
her
hands
to
her
sides
merton
arose
in
some
alarm
and
was
reassured
when
the
victim
betrayed
signs
of
mastering
her
infirmity
she
wiped
her
eyes
presently
and
explained
her
outbreak
you
looked
so
much
like
parmalee
i
just
couldn
t
help
thinking
how
funny
it
was
it
just
seemed
to
go
over
me
like
anything
like
a
spasm
or
something
when
i
got
to
thinking
what
parmalee
would
say
if
he
saw
someone
looking
so
much
like
him
see
that
was
why
i
he
was
sympathetic
and
delighted
in
equal
parts
the
girl
had
really
seemed
to
suffer
from
her
paroxysm
yet
it
was
a
splendid
tribute
to
his
screen
worth
it
was
at
this
moment
that
baird
entered
he
tossed
his
hat
on
a
chair
and
turned
to
the
couple
mr
baird
shake
hands
with
my
friend
merton
gill
his
stage
name
is
clifford
very
pleased
to
meet
you
said
merton
grasping
the
extended
hand
he
hoped
he
had
not
been
too
dignified
too
condescending
baird
would
sometime
doubtless
know
that
he
did
not
approve
of
those
comedies
but
for
the
present
he
must
demean
himself
to
pay
back
some
money
borrowed
from
a
working
girl
delighted
said
baird
then
he
bent
a
suddenly
troubled
gaze
upon
the
gill
lineaments
he
held
this
a
long
moment
breaking
it
only
with
a
sudden
dramatic
turning
to
miss
montague
what
s
this
my
child
you
re
playing
tricks
on
the
old
again
he
incredulously
scanned
the
face
of
merton
who
is
this
man
he
demanded
i
told
you
he
s
merton
gill
from
gushwomp
ohio
said
the
girl
looking
pleased
and
expectant
simsbury
illinois
put
in
merton
quickly
wishing
the
girl
could
be
better
at
remembering
names
baird
at
last
seemed
to
be
convinced
he
heavily
smote
an
open
palm
with
a
clenched
fist
well
i
ll
be
swoshed
i
thought
you
must
be
kidding
if
i
d
seen
him
out
on
the
lot
i
d
a
said
he
was
the
twin
brother
of
harold
there
exclaimed
the
girl
triumphantly
didn
t
i
say
he
d
see
it
right
quick
you
can
t
keep
a
thing
from
this
old
bey
now
you
just
came
over
here
to
this
desk
and
look
at
this
fine
batch
of
stills
he
had
taken
by
a
regular
artist
back
in
ah
exclaimed
baird
unctuously
i
bet
they
re
good
show
he
went
to
the
desk
be
seated
gill
while
i
have
a
look
at
merton
gill
under
the
eye
of
baird
which
clung
to
him
with
something
close
to
fascination
sat
down
he
took
the
chair
with
fine
dignity
a
certain
masterly
deliberation
he
sat
easily
and
seemed
to
await
a
verdict
confidently
foreknown
baird
s
eyes
did
not
leave
him
for
the
stills
until
he
had
assumed
a
slightly
harold
parmalee
pose
then
his
head
with
the
girl
s
bent
over
the
pictures
he
began
to
examine
them
exclamations
of
delight
came
from
the
pair
merton
gill
listened
amiably
he
was
not
greatly
thrilled
by
an
admiration
which
he
had
long
believed
to
be
his
due
had
he
not
always
supposed
that
things
of
precisely
this
sort
would
be
said
about
those
stills
when
at
last
they
came
under
the
eyes
of
the
right
people
like
the
montague
girl
baird
was
chiefly
impressed
with
the
westerns
he
looked
a
long
time
at
them
especially
at
the
one
where
merton
s
face
was
emotionally
averted
from
his
old
pal
pinto
at
the
moment
of
farewell
regarding
baird
as
he
stood
holding
this
art
study
up
to
the
light
merton
became
aware
for
the
first
time
that
baird
suffered
from
some
nervous
affliction
a
peculiar
twitching
of
the
lips
a
trembling
of
the
chin
which
he
had
sometimes
observed
in
senile
persons
all
at
once
baird
seemed
quite
overcome
by
this
infirmity
he
put
a
handkerchief
to
his
face
and
uttered
a
muffled
excuse
as
he
hastily
left
the
room
outside
the
noise
of
his
heavy
tread
died
swiftly
away
down
the
hall
the
montague
girl
remained
at
the
desk
there
was
a
strange
light
in
her
eyes
and
her
face
was
still
flushed
she
shot
a
glance
of
encouragement
at
merton
don
t
be
nervous
old
kid
he
likes
em
all
he
reassured
her
lightly
oh
i
m
not
a
bit
nervous
about
him
it
ain
t
as
if
he
was
doing
something
worth
while
instead
of
mere
the
girl
s
colour
seemed
to
heighten
you
be
sure
to
tell
him
that
talk
right
up
to
him
be
sure
to
say
mere
it
ll
show
him
you
know
what
s
what
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
kid
he
s
trying
to
do
something
worth
while
right
this
minute
something
serious
that
s
why
he
s
so
interested
in
well
of
course
that
s
he
was
glad
to
learn
this
of
baird
he
would
take
the
man
seriously
if
he
tried
to
be
serious
to
do
something
fine
and
distinctive
baird
here
returned
looking
grave
the
montague
girl
seemed
more
strangely
intense
she
beckoned
the
manager
to
her
side
now
here
jeff
here
was
something
i
just
naturally
had
to
laugh
baird
had
not
wholly
conquered
those
facial
spasms
but
he
controlled
himself
to
say
show
me
now
merton
directed
the
girl
take
that
same
pose
again
like
you
did
for
me
the
way
you
are
in
this
as
merton
adjusted
himself
to
the
parmalee
pose
she
handed
the
picture
to
baird
now
jeff
i
ask
you
ain
t
that
harold
to
the
life
ain
t
it
so
near
him
that
you
just
have
to
laugh
your
head
off
it
was
even
so
baird
and
the
girl
both
laughed
convulsively
the
former
with
rumbling
chuckles
that
shook
his
frame
when
he
had
again
composed
himself
he
said
well
gill
i
think
you
and
i
can
do
a
little
business
i
don
t
know
what
your
idea
about
a
contract
is
but
merton
gill
quickly
interrupted
well
you
see
i
d
hardly
like
to
sign
a
contract
with
you
not
for
those
mere
comedies
you
do
i
ll
do
anything
to
earn
a
little
money
right
now
so
i
can
pay
back
this
young
lady
but
i
wouldn
t
like
to
go
on
playing
in
such
things
with
people
and
waiters
on
roller
skates
and
all
that
what
i
really
would
like
to
do
is
something
fine
and
worth
while
but
not
clowning
in
mere
buckeye
baird
who
had
devoted
the
best
part
of
an
active
career
to
the
production
of
buckeye
comedies
and
who
regarded
them
as
at
least
one
expression
of
the
very
highest
art
did
not
even
flinch
at
these
cool
words
he
had
once
been
an
actor
himself
taking
the
blow
like
a
man
he
beamed
upon
his
critic
exactly
my
boy
don
t
you
think
i
ll
ever
ask
you
to
come
down
to
clowning
you
might
work
with
me
for
years
and
i
d
never
ask
you
to
do
a
thing
that
wasn
t
serious
in
fact
that
s
why
i
m
hoping
to
engage
you
now
i
want
to
do
a
serious
picture
i
want
to
get
out
of
all
that
stuff
see
something
fine
and
worth
while
like
you
say
and
you
re
the
very
actor
i
need
in
this
new
well
of
course
in
that
case
this
was
different
he
made
it
plain
that
in
the
case
of
a
manager
striving
for
higher
things
he
was
not
one
to
withhold
a
helping
hand
he
was
beginning
to
feel
a
great
sympathy
for
baird
in
his
efforts
for
the
worth
while
he
thawed
somewhat
from
the
reserve
that
buckeye
comedies
had
put
upon
him
he
chatted
amiably
under
promptings
from
the
girl
he
spoke
freely
of
his
career
both
in
simsbury
and
in
hollywood
it
was
twelve
o
clock
before
they
seemed
willing
to
let
him
go
and
from
time
to
time
they
would
pause
to
gloat
over
the
stills
at
last
baird
said
cheerily
well
my
lad
i
need
you
in
my
new
piece
how
ll
it
be
if
i
put
you
on
my
payroll
beginning
at
forty
a
week
how
about
it
hey
well
i
d
like
that
first
rate
only
i
haven
t
worked
any
you
shouldn
t
pay
me
for
just
coming
the
manager
waved
a
hand
airily
that
s
all
right
my
boy
you
ve
earned
a
day
s
salary
just
coming
here
to
cheer
me
up
these
mere
comedies
get
me
so
down
in
the
dumps
sometimes
and
besides
you
re
not
through
yet
i
m
going
to
use
you
some
more
listen
now
the
manager
had
become
coldly
businesslike
you
go
up
to
a
little
theatre
on
hollywood
boulevard
you
can
t
miss
it
where
they
re
running
a
harold
parmalee
picture
i
saw
it
last
night
and
i
want
you
to
see
it
better
see
it
afternoon
and
evening
yes
sir
said
merton
and
watch
parmalee
study
him
in
this
picture
you
look
like
him
already
but
see
if
you
can
pick
up
some
of
his
tricks
see
what
i
mean
because
it
s
a
regular
parmalee
part
i
m
going
to
have
you
do
see
kind
of
a
society
part
to
start
with
and
then
we
work
in
some
of
your
western
stuff
at
the
finish
but
get
parmalee
as
much
as
you
can
that
s
all
now
oh
yes
and
can
you
leave
these
stills
with
me
our
publicity
man
may
want
to
use
them
all
right
baird
i
ll
do
just
what
you
say
and
of
course
you
can
keep
the
stills
as
long
as
i
got
an
engagement
with
you
and
i
m
very
glad
you
re
trying
to
do
something
really
worth
thanks
said
baird
averting
his
face
the
girl
followed
him
into
the
hall
great
work
boy
and
take
it
from
me
you
ll
go
over
say
honest
now
i
m
glad
clear
down
into
my
she
had
both
his
hands
again
and
he
could
see
that
her
eyes
were
moist
she
seemed
to
be
an
impressionable
little
thing
hysterical
one
minute
while
looking
at
a
bunch
of
good
stills
and
sort
of
weepy
the
next
but
he
was
beginning
to
like
her
in
spite
of
her
funny
talk
and
free
ways
and
say
she
called
after
him
when
he
had
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
you
know
you
haven
t
had
much
experience
yet
with
a
bunch
of
troupers
many
a
one
will
be
jealous
of
you
the
minute
you
begin
to
climb
and
maybe
they
ll
get
fresh
and
try
to
kid
you
see
but
don
t
you
mind
it
give
it
right
back
to
them
or
tell
me
if
they
get
too
raw
just
remember
i
got
a
mean
right
when
i
swing
all
right
thank
you
he
replied
but
his
bewilderment
was
plain
she
stared
a
moment
danced
up
to
him
and
seized
a
hand
in
both
of
hers
what
i
mean
son
if
you
feel
bothered
any
time
by
anything
just
come
to
me
with
it
see
i
m
in
this
piece
and
i
ll
look
out
for
you
don
t
forget
she
dropped
his
hand
and
was
back
in
the
office
while
he
mumbled
his
thanks
for
what
he
knew
she
had
meant
as
a
kindness
so
she
was
to
be
in
the
baird
piece
she
too
would
be
trying
to
give
the
public
something
better
and
finer
still
he
was
puzzled
at
her
believing
he
might
need
to
be
looked
out
for
an
actor
drawing
forty
dollars
a
week
could
surely
look
out
for
himself
he
emerged
into
the
open
of
the
holden
lot
as
one
who
had
at
last
achieved
success
after
long
and
gruelling
privation
he
walked
briefly
among
the
scenes
of
this
privation
pausing
in
reminiscent
mood
before
the
crystal
palace
hotel
and
other
outstanding
spots
where
he
had
so
stoically
suffered
the
torments
of
hunger
and
discouragement
he
remembered
to
be
glad
now
that
no
letter
of
appeal
had
actually
gone
to
gashwiler
suppose
he
had
built
up
in
the
old
gentleman
s
mind
a
false
hope
that
he
might
again
employ
merton
gill
a
good
thing
he
had
held
out
yesterday
he
was
starving
and
penniless
he
was
fed
and
on
someone
s
payroll
for
probably
as
much
money
a
week
as
gashwiler
netted
from
his
entire
business
from
sheer
force
of
association
as
he
thus
meditated
he
found
himself
hungry
and
a
few
moments
later
he
was
selecting
from
the
food
counter
of
the
cafeteria
whatever
chanced
to
appeal
to
the
eye
no
weighing
of
prices
now
before
he
had
finished
his
meal
henshaw
and
his
governor
brought
their
trays
to
the
adjoining
table
merton
studied
with
new
interest
the
director
who
would
some
day
be
telling
people
that
he
had
been
the
first
to
observe
the
aptitude
of
this
new
star
had
in
fact
given
him
a
lot
of
footage
and
and
medium
shots
and
dramatics
in
the
blight
of
broadway
when
he
was
a
mere
extra
before
he
had
made
himself
known
to
the
public
in
jeff
baird
s
first
piece
he
was
strongly
moved
now
to
bring
himself
to
henshaw
s
notice
when
he
heard
the
latter
say
it
s
a
regular
harold
parmalee
part
good
light
comedy
plenty
of
heart
interest
and
that
corking
fight
on
the
he
wanted
to
tell
henshaw
that
he
himself
was
already
engaged
to
do
a
harold
parmalee
part
and
had
been
told
not
two
hours
ago
that
he
would
by
most
people
be
taken
for
parmalee
s
twin
brother
he
restrained
this
impulse
however
as
henshaw
went
on
to
talk
of
the
piece
in
hand
it
proved
to
be
robinson
crusoe
which
he
had
already
discussed
or
rather
not
robinson
crusoe
any
longer
not
even
robinson
crusoe
junior
it
was
to
have
been
called
island
passion
he
learned
but
this
title
had
been
amended
to
island
love
they
re
getting
fed
up
on
that
word
passion
henshaw
was
saying
and
anyhow
love
seems
to
go
better
with
island
don
t
you
think
governor
desert
passion
was
all
right
there
s
something
strong
and
intense
about
a
desert
but
island
is
and
it
appeared
that
island
love
though
having
begun
as
robinson
crusoe
would
contain
few
of
the
outstanding
features
of
that
tale
instead
of
crusoe
s
wrecked
there
was
a
wrecked
steam
yacht
a
very
expensive
yacht
stocked
with
all
modern
luxuries
nor
would
there
be
a
native
friday
and
his
supposed
sister
with
the
tattooed
shoulder
but
a
wealthy
young
new
yorker
and
his
valet
who
would
be
good
for
comedy
on
a
desert
island
and
a
beautiful
girl
and
a
scoundrel
who
would
in
the
last
reel
be
thrown
over
the
cliffs
henshaw
was
vivacious
about
the
effects
he
would
get
i
ve
been
wondering
governor
he
continued
if
we
re
going
to
kill
off
the
heavy
whether
we
shouldn
t
plant
it
early
that
besides
wanting
this
girl
who
s
on
the
island
he
s
the
same
scoundrel
that
wronged
the
young
sister
of
the
lead
that
owns
the
yacht
see
what
i
mean
would
give
more
but
here
the
governor
frowned
and
spoke
after
a
moment
s
pause
your
young
new
yorker
is
rich
isn
t
he
fine
old
family
and
all
that
how
could
he
have
a
sister
that
would
get
wronged
you
couldn
t
do
it
if
he
s
got
a
wronged
sister
he
d
have
to
be
a
workingman
or
a
sailor
or
something
and
she
couldn
t
be
a
new
york
society
girl
she
d
have
to
be
working
some
place
in
a
store
or
office
don
t
you
see
how
could
you
have
a
swell
young
new
yorker
with
a
wronged
sister
real
society
girls
never
get
wronged
unless
their
father
loses
his
money
and
then
it
s
never
anything
serious
enough
to
kill
a
heavy
for
no
that
s
wait
i
have
henshaw
beamed
with
a
new
inspiration
you
just
said
a
sailor
could
have
his
sister
wronged
so
why
not
have
one
on
the
yacht
a
good
strong
type
you
know
and
his
little
sister
was
wronged
by
the
heavy
and
he
d
never
known
who
it
was
because
the
little
girl
wouldn
t
tell
him
even
on
her
but
he
found
the
chap
s
photograph
in
her
trunk
and
on
the
yacht
he
sees
that
it
was
this
same
heavy
and
there
you
are
revenge
see
what
i
mean
he
fights
with
the
heavy
on
the
cliff
after
showing
him
the
little
sister
s
picture
and
pushes
him
over
to
death
on
the
rocks
below
get
it
and
the
lead
doesn
t
have
to
kill
him
how
about
that
henshaw
regarded
his
companion
with
pleasant
anticipation
the
governor
again
debated
before
he
spoke
he
still
doubted
say
whose
show
is
this
the
lead
s
or
the
sailor
s
that
had
the
wronged
sister
you
d
have
to
show
the
sailor
and
his
sister
and
show
her
being
wronged
by
the
heavy
that
d
take
a
big
cabaret
set
at
least
and
you
d
have
to
let
the
sailor
begin
his
stuff
on
the
yacht
and
then
by
the
time
he
d
kept
it
up
a
bit
after
the
wreck
had
pulled
off
the
fight
where
would
your
lead
be
can
you
see
parmalee
playing
second
to
this
sailor
why
the
sailor
d
run
away
with
the
piece
and
that
cabaret
set
would
cost
money
when
we
don
t
need
it
just
keep
those
things
in
mind
a
well
henshaw
submitted
gracefully
anyway
i
think
my
suggestion
of
island
love
is
better
than
island
passion
kind
of
sounds
more
attractive
don
t
you
think
the
governor
lighted
a
cigarette
say
howard
it
s
a
wonderful
business
isn
t
it
we
start
with
poor
old
robinson
crusoe
and
his
goats
and
parrot
and
man
friday
and
after
dropping
friday
s
sister
who
would
really
be
the
countess
of
kleig
we
wind
up
with
a
and
a
comic
butler
and
call
it
island
love
who
said
the
art
of
the
motion
picture
is
in
its
infancy
in
this
case
it
ll
be
plumb
senile
well
go
ahead
with
the
boys
and
dope
out
your
hogwash
gosh
sometimes
i
think
i
wouldn
t
stay
in
the
business
if
it
wasn
t
for
the
money
and
remember
don
t
you
let
a
single
solitary
sailor
on
that
yacht
have
a
wronged
sister
that
can
blame
it
on
the
heavy
or
you
ll
never
have
parmalee
playing
the
again
merton
gill
debated
bringing
himself
to
the
notice
of
these
gentlemen
if
parmalee
wouldn
t
play
the
part
for
any
reason
like
a
sailor
s
wronged
sister
he
would
it
would
help
him
to
be
known
in
parmalee
parts
still
he
couldn
t
tell
how
soon
they
might
need
him
nor
how
soon
baird
would
release
him
he
regretfully
saw
the
two
men
leave
however
he
might
have
missed
a
chance
even
better
than
baird
would
give
him
he
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
still
a
professional
duty
to
perform
he
must
that
afternoon
and
also
that
evening
watch
a
harold
parmalee
picture
he
left
the
cafeteria
swaggered
by
the
watchman
at
the
had
now
the
professional
standing
to
silence
that
made
his
way
to
the
theatre
baird
had
mentioned
in
front
he
studied
the
billing
of
the
parmalee
picture
it
was
object
smashing
comedy
of
love
and
harold
parmalee
with
a
gesture
of
mock
dismay
seemed
to
repulse
a
bevy
of
beautiful
maidens
who
wooed
him
merton
took
his
seat
with
a
dismay
that
was
not
mock
for
it
now
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
no
experience
in
love
scenes
and
that
an
actor
playing
parmalee
parts
would
need
a
great
deal
of
such
experience
in
simsbury
there
had
been
no
opportunity
for
an
intending
actor
to
learn
certain
little
niceties
expected
at
sentimental
moments
even
his
private
life
had
been
almost
barren
of
adventures
that
might
now
profit
him
he
had
sometimes
played
kissing
games
at
parties
and
there
had
been
the
more
serious
affair
with
edwina
may
when
he
had
escorted
her
from
church
or
sociables
to
the
pulver
gate
and
lingered
in
a
sort
of
nervously
worded
ecstasy
until
he
could
summon
courage
to
kiss
the
girl
twice
this
had
actually
happened
but
the
affair
had
come
to
nothing
because
the
pulvers
had
moved
away
from
simsbury
and
he
had
practically
forgotten
edwina
may
forgotten
even
the
scared
haste
of
those
embraces
he
seemed
to
remember
that
he
had
grabbed
her
and
kissed
her
but
was
it
on
her
cheek
or
nose
anyway
he
was
now
quite
certain
that
the
mechanics
of
this
dead
amour
were
not
those
approved
of
in
the
best
screen
circles
never
had
he
gathered
a
beauteous
girl
in
his
arms
and
very
slowly
very
accurately
very
tenderly
done
what
parmalee
and
other
screen
actors
did
in
their
final
even
when
beulah
baxter
had
been
his
screen
ideal
he
had
never
seen
himself
as
doing
more
than
save
her
from
some
dreadful
fate
of
course
later
if
he
had
found
out
that
she
was
unwed
he
resolved
now
to
devote
special
study
to
parmalee
s
methods
of
wooing
the
fair
creature
who
would
be
found
in
his
arms
at
the
close
of
the
present
film
probably
baird
would
want
some
of
that
stuff
from
him
from
the
very
beginning
of
object
matrimony
it
was
apparent
that
the
picture
drama
would
afford
him
excellent
opportunities
for
studying
the
parmalee
technique
in
what
an
early
subtitle
called
the
eternal
battle
of
the
for
parmalee
in
the
play
was
hubert
throckmorton
popular
screen
idol
and
surfeited
with
the
attentions
of
adoring
women
cunningly
the
dramatist
made
use
of
parmalee
s
own
personality
of
his
screen
triumphs
and
of
the
adulation
lavished
upon
him
by
discriminating
fair
ones
his
breakfast
tray
was
shown
piled
with
missives
amply
attesting
the
truth
of
what
the
interviewer
had
said
of
his
charm
all
women
seemed
to
adore
hubert
throckmorton
in
the
drama
even
as
all
women
adored
harold
parmalee
in
private
life
the
screen
revealed
throckmorton
quite
savagely
ripping
open
the
letters
glancing
at
their
contents
and
flinging
them
from
him
with
humorous
shudders
he
seemed
to
be
asking
why
these
foolish
creatures
couldn
t
let
an
artist
alone
yet
he
was
kindly
in
this
mood
there
was
a
blending
of
chagrin
and
amused
tolerance
on
his
face
as
the
screen
had
him
murmur
casting
the
letter
aside
poor
silly
little
girls
from
this
early
scene
merton
learned
parmalee
s
method
of
withdrawing
the
gold
cigarette
case
of
fastidiously
selecting
a
cigarette
of
closing
the
case
and
of
absently
thinking
of
other
matters
tamping
the
thing
against
the
cover
this
was
an
item
that
he
had
overlooked
he
should
have
done
that
in
the
cabaret
scene
he
also
mastered
the
parmalee
trick
of
withdrawing
the
handkerchief
from
the
cuff
of
the
perfectly
fitting
morning
coat
that
was
something
else
he
should
have
done
in
the
blight
of
broadway
little
things
like
that
done
right
gave
the
actor
his
distinction
the
drama
progressed
millionaire
jasper
gordon
a
power
in
wall
street
was
seen
telephoning
to
throckmorton
he
was
entreating
the
young
actor
to
spend
the
at
his
palatial
long
island
country
home
to
meet
a
few
of
his
friends
the
grim
old
wall
street
magnate
was
perturbed
by
throckmorton
s
refusal
and
renewed
his
appeal
he
was
one
of
those
who
always
had
his
way
in
wall
street
and
he
at
length
prevailed
upon
throckmorton
to
accept
his
invitation
he
than
manifested
the
wildest
delight
and
he
was
excitedly
kissed
by
his
beautiful
daughter
who
had
been
standing
by
his
side
in
the
sumptuous
library
while
he
telephoned
it
could
be
seen
that
the
daughter
even
more
than
her
grim
old
father
wished
throckmorton
to
be
at
the
long
island
country
home
later
throckmorton
was
seen
driving
his
roadster
accompanied
only
by
his
valet
to
the
gordon
country
home
on
long
island
a
splendid
mansion
surrounded
by
its
landscaped
grounds
where
fountains
played
and
roses
bloomed
against
the
feathery
background
of
graceful
eucalyptus
trees
merton
gill
here
saw
that
he
must
learn
to
drive
a
roadster
probably
baird
would
want
some
of
that
stuff
too
a
round
of
gaieties
ensued
permitting
throckmorton
to
appear
in
a
series
of
perfectly
fitting
sports
costumes
he
was
seen
on
his
favourite
hunter
on
the
tennis
courts
on
the
first
tee
of
the
golf
course
on
a
polo
pony
and
in
the
mazes
of
the
dance
very
early
it
was
learned
that
the
gordon
daughter
had
tired
of
mere
social
triumphs
and
wished
to
take
up
screen
acting
in
a
serious
way
she
audaciously
requested
throckmorton
to
give
her
a
chance
as
leading
lady
in
his
next
great
picture
he
softened
his
refusal
by
explaining
to
her
that
acting
was
a
difficult
profession
and
that
suffering
and
sacrifice
were
necessary
to
round
out
the
artist
the
beautiful
girl
replied
that
within
ten
days
he
would
be
compelled
to
admit
her
rare
ability
as
an
actress
and
laughingly
they
wagered
a
kiss
upon
it
merton
felt
that
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
he
must
know
more
about
throckmorton
was
courteously
gallant
in
the
scene
even
when
he
said
shall
we
put
up
the
stakes
now
miss
gordon
it
could
be
seen
that
he
was
jesting
he
carried
this
light
manner
through
minor
scenes
with
the
beautiful
young
girl
friends
of
miss
gordon
who
wooed
him
lay
in
wait
for
him
ogled
and
sighed
always
he
was
the
laughingly
tolerant
conqueror
who
had
but
a
lazy
scorn
for
his
triumphs
he
did
not
strike
the
graver
note
until
it
became
suspected
that
there
were
crooks
in
the
house
bent
upon
stealing
the
famous
gordon
jewels
that
it
was
throckmorton
who
averted
this
catastrophe
by
sheer
nerve
and
by
use
of
his
rare
histrionic
powers
as
when
he
disguised
himself
in
the
coat
and
hat
of
the
arch
crook
whom
he
had
felled
with
a
single
blow
and
left
bound
and
gagged
in
order
to
receive
the
casket
of
jewels
from
the
thief
who
opened
the
safe
in
the
library
and
that
he
laughed
away
the
thanks
of
the
grateful
millionaire
astonished
no
one
in
the
audience
though
it
caused
merton
gill
to
wonder
if
he
could
fell
a
crook
with
one
blow
he
must
practice
up
some
blows
throckmorton
left
the
palatial
country
home
wearied
by
the
continuous
adulation
the
last
to
speed
him
was
the
gordon
daughter
who
reminded
him
of
their
wager
within
ten
days
he
would
acknowledge
her
to
be
an
actress
fit
to
play
as
his
leading
woman
throckmorton
drove
rapidly
to
a
simple
farm
where
he
was
not
known
and
would
be
no
longer
surfeited
with
attentions
he
dressed
plainly
in
shirts
that
opened
wide
at
the
neck
and
assisted
in
the
farm
labours
such
as
pitching
hay
and
leading
horses
into
the
barn
it
was
the
simple
existence
that
he
had
been
craving
away
from
it
all
no
one
suspected
him
to
be
hubert
throckmorton
least
of
all
the
simple
country
maiden
daughter
of
the
farmer
in
her
neat
print
dress
and
heavy
braid
of
golden
hair
that
hung
from
beneath
her
sunbonnet
she
knew
him
to
be
only
a
man
among
men
a
simple
farm
labourer
and
hubert
throckmorton
wearied
by
the
adulation
of
his
feminine
public
was
instantly
charmed
by
her
coy
acceptance
of
his
attentions
that
this
charm
should
ripen
to
love
was
to
be
expected
here
was
a
child
simple
innocent
of
a
beauty
in
her
print
dress
and
sunbonnet
who
would
love
him
for
himself
alone
beside
a
blossoming
orange
tree
on
the
simple
long
island
farm
he
declared
his
love
warning
the
child
that
he
had
nothing
to
offer
her
but
two
strong
arms
and
a
heart
full
of
devotion
the
little
girl
shyly
betrayed
that
she
returned
his
love
but
told
him
that
he
must
first
obtain
the
permission
of
her
grandmother
without
which
she
would
never
consent
to
wed
him
she
hastened
into
the
old
farmhouse
to
prepare
grandmother
for
the
interview
throckmorton
presently
faced
the
old
lady
who
sat
huddled
in
an
armchair
her
hands
crooked
over
a
cane
a
ruffled
cap
above
her
silvery
hair
he
manfully
voiced
his
request
for
the
child
s
hand
in
marriage
the
old
lady
seemed
to
mumble
an
assent
the
happy
lover
looked
about
for
his
fiance
when
to
his
stupefaction
the
old
lady
arose
briskly
from
her
chair
threw
off
cap
silvery
wig
gown
of
black
and
stood
revealed
as
the
child
herself
smiling
roguishly
up
at
him
from
beneath
the
sunbonnet
with
a
glad
cry
he
would
have
seized
her
when
she
stayed
him
with
lifted
hand
once
more
she
astounded
him
swiftly
she
threw
off
sunbonnet
blonde
wig
print
dress
and
stood
before
him
revealed
as
none
other
than
the
gordon
daughter
hubert
throckmorton
had
lost
his
wager
slowly
as
the
light
of
recognition
dawned
in
his
widening
eyes
he
gathered
the
beautiful
girl
into
his
arms
now
may
i
be
your
leading
lady
she
asked
my
leading
lady
not
only
in
my
next
picture
but
for
life
he
replied
there
was
a
pretty
little
scene
in
which
the
wager
was
paid
merton
studied
it
twice
again
that
evening
he
studied
it
he
was
doubtful
it
would
seem
queer
to
take
a
girl
around
the
waist
that
way
and
kiss
her
so
slowly
maybe
he
could
learn
and
he
knew
he
could
already
do
that
widening
of
the
eyes
he
could
probably
do
it
as
well
as
parmalee
did
back
in
the
buckeye
office
when
the
montague
girl
had
returned
from
her
parting
with
merton
baird
had
said
kid
you
ve
brightened
my
whole
didn
t
i
tell
you
he
s
a
lot
better
than
you
but
can
you
use
him
you
can
t
tell
you
can
t
tell
till
you
try
him
out
he
might
be
good
and
he
might
blow
up
right
at
the
i
bet
he
ll
be
good
i
tell
you
jeff
that
boy
is
just
full
of
acting
all
you
got
to
do
keep
his
stuff
straight
serious
he
can
t
help
but
be
funny
that
we
ll
see
we
ll
kind
of
feel
him
out
he
ll
see
this
parmalee
film
i
caught
it
last
night
and
there
s
some
stuff
in
it
i
want
to
play
horse
with
see
so
i
ll
start
him
in
a
quiet
scene
and
find
out
does
he
handle
if
he
does
we
ll
go
right
into
some
hokum
drama
stuff
the
more
serious
he
plays
it
the
better
it
ought
to
be
good
but
you
can
t
ever
tell
in
our
trade
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
the
girl
was
confident
i
can
tell
about
this
lad
she
insisted
chapter
xiii
genius
comes
into
its
own
merton
gill
enacting
the
part
of
a
popular
screen
idol
as
in
the
play
of
yesterday
sat
at
breakfast
in
his
apartments
on
stage
number
five
outwardly
he
was
cool
wary
unperturbed
as
he
peeled
the
shell
from
a
egg
and
sprinkled
salt
upon
it
for
the
breakfast
consisted
of
eggs
and
potato
salad
brought
on
in
a
wooden
dish
he
had
been
slightly
disturbed
by
the
items
of
this
meal
it
was
not
so
elegant
a
breakfast
as
hubert
throckmorton
s
but
he
had
been
told
by
baird
that
they
must
be
a
little
different
he
had
been
slightly
disturbed
too
at
discovering
the
faithful
valet
who
brought
on
the
simple
repast
was
the
cross
eyed
man
still
the
fellow
had
behaved
respectfully
as
a
valet
should
he
had
been
quietly
obsequious
of
manner
revealing
only
a
profound
admiration
for
his
master
and
a
constant
solicitude
for
his
comfort
probably
he
like
baird
was
trying
to
do
something
distinctive
and
worth
while
having
finished
the
last
egg
glad
they
had
given
him
no
more
than
three
the
popular
screen
idol
at
the
prompting
of
baird
back
by
the
cameras
arose
withdrew
a
metal
cigarette
case
purchased
that
very
morning
with
this
scene
in
view
and
selected
a
cigarette
he
stood
negligently
as
parmalee
had
stood
tapped
the
end
of
the
cigarette
on
the
side
of
the
case
as
parmalee
had
done
lighted
a
match
on
the
sole
of
his
boot
and
idly
smoked
in
the
parmalee
manner
three
times
the
day
before
he
had
studied
parmalee
in
this
bit
of
business
now
he
idly
crossed
to
the
upon
which
reposed
a
large
photograph
album
he
turned
the
pages
of
this
pausing
to
admire
the
pictures
there
revealed
baird
had
not
only
given
him
general
instructions
for
this
scene
but
now
prompted
him
in
low
encouraging
tones
turn
over
slowly
you
like
em
all
now
lift
the
album
up
and
hold
it
for
a
better
light
on
that
one
it
s
one
of
the
best
it
pleases
you
a
lot
look
even
more
pleased
smile
that
s
good
put
down
the
album
turn
again
slowly
turn
twice
more
that
s
it
pick
it
up
again
this
one
is
fine
baird
took
him
through
the
album
in
this
manner
had
him
close
it
when
all
the
leaves
were
turned
and
stand
a
moment
with
one
hand
resting
on
it
the
album
had
been
empty
it
had
been
deemed
best
not
to
inform
the
actor
that
later
of
the
pages
would
show
him
to
have
been
refreshed
by
studying
photographs
of
himself
copies
in
fact
of
the
stills
of
clifford
armytage
at
that
moment
resting
on
baird
s
desk
as
he
stood
now
a
hand
affectionately
upon
the
album
a
trace
of
the
fatuously
admiring
smile
still
lingering
on
his
expressive
face
a
knock
sounded
upon
the
door
come
in
he
called
the
valet
entered
with
the
morning
mail
this
consisted
entirely
of
letters
there
were
hundreds
of
them
and
the
valet
had
heaped
them
in
a
large
which
he
now
held
respectfully
in
front
of
him
the
actor
motioned
him
with
an
authentic
parmalee
gesture
to
place
them
by
the
table
the
valet
obeyed
though
spilling
many
letters
from
the
top
of
the
overflowing
basket
these
while
his
master
seated
himself
he
briskly
swept
up
with
a
broom
the
chagrined
amusement
of
harold
parmalee
the
tolerance
for
this
perhaps
excusable
weakness
of
woman
was
here
accurately
manifested
the
actor
yawned
slightly
lighted
another
cigarette
with
flawless
parmalee
technique
withdrew
a
handkerchief
from
his
lightly
touched
his
forehead
with
it
and
began
to
open
the
letters
he
glanced
at
each
one
in
a
quick
bored
manner
and
cast
it
aside
when
a
dozen
or
so
had
been
thus
treated
he
was
aroused
by
another
knock
at
the
door
it
opened
to
reveal
the
valet
with
another
basket
overflowing
with
letters
upon
this
the
actor
arose
spread
his
arms
wide
in
a
gesture
of
humorous
helplessness
he
held
this
briefly
then
drooped
in
humorous
despair
he
lighted
another
cigarette
eyed
the
letters
with
that
whimsical
lift
of
the
brows
so
characteristic
of
parmalee
and
lazily
blew
smoke
toward
them
then
regarding
the
smoke
he
idly
waved
a
hand
through
it
poor
silly
little
girls
but
there
was
a
charming
tolerance
in
his
manner
one
felt
his
generous
recognition
that
they
were
not
wholly
without
provocation
this
appeared
to
close
the
simple
episode
the
scenes
to
be
sure
had
not
been
shot
without
delays
and
rehearsals
and
a
good
two
hours
of
the
morning
had
elapsed
before
the
actor
was
released
from
the
glare
of
light
and
the
need
to
remember
that
he
was
harold
parmalee
his
peeling
of
an
egg
for
example
had
not
at
first
been
dainty
enough
to
please
the
director
and
the
scene
with
the
album
had
required
many
rehearsals
to
secure
the
needed
variety
of
expressions
but
baird
had
been
helpful
in
his
promptings
and
always
kind
now
this
one
you
ve
turned
over
it
s
someone
you
love
better
than
anybody
it
might
be
your
dear
old
mother
that
you
haven
t
seen
for
years
it
makes
you
kind
of
solemn
as
you
show
how
fond
you
were
of
her
you
re
affected
deeply
by
her
face
that
s
it
fine
now
the
next
one
you
like
it
just
as
much
but
it
pleases
you
more
it
s
someone
else
you
re
fond
of
but
you
re
not
so
solemn
now
turn
over
another
but
very
slow
slow
but
don
t
let
go
of
it
stop
a
minute
and
turn
back
as
if
you
had
to
have
another
peek
at
the
last
one
see
what
i
mean
take
plenty
of
time
this
is
a
great
treat
for
you
it
makes
you
feel
kind
of
religious
now
you
re
getting
it
that
s
the
boy
all
right
the
scene
where
he
showed
humorous
dismay
at
the
quantity
of
his
mail
had
needed
but
one
rehearsal
he
had
here
been
harold
parmalee
without
effort
also
he
had
not
been
asked
to
do
again
the
parmalee
trick
of
lighting
a
cigarette
nor
of
withdrawing
the
handkerchief
from
its
cuff
to
twice
touch
his
forehead
in
moments
of
amused
perplexity
baird
had
merely
uttered
a
low
fine
at
beholding
these
bits
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
when
released
from
the
set
seemingly
he
had
met
the
test
baird
had
said
that
morning
now
we
ll
just
run
a
little
kind
of
test
to
find
out
a
few
things
about
you
and
had
followed
with
a
general
description
of
the
scenes
it
was
to
be
of
no
great
importance
a
minor
detail
of
the
picture
perhaps
this
had
been
why
the
wealthy
actor
breakfasted
in
rather
a
plainly
furnished
room
on
eggs
and
potato
salad
perhaps
this
had
been
why
the
costume
given
him
had
been
not
too
well
fitting
not
too
nice
in
detail
perhaps
this
was
why
they
had
allowed
the
man
to
appear
as
his
valet
he
was
quite
sure
this
man
would
not
do
as
a
valet
in
a
picture
anyway
however
unimportant
the
scene
he
felt
that
he
had
acquitted
himself
with
credit
the
montague
girl
who
had
made
him
up
that
morning
with
close
attention
to
his
eyebrows
watched
him
from
back
of
the
cameras
and
she
seized
both
his
hands
when
he
left
the
set
you
re
going
to
land
she
warmly
assured
him
i
can
tell
a
trouper
when
i
see
she
was
in
costume
she
was
apparently
doing
the
part
of
a
society
girl
though
slightly
overdressed
he
thought
we
re
working
on
another
set
for
this
same
picture
she
explained
but
i
simply
had
to
catch
you
acting
you
ll
probably
be
over
with
us
but
you
re
through
for
the
day
so
beat
it
and
have
a
good
couldn
t
i
come
over
and
watch
you
no
baird
doesn
t
like
to
have
his
actors
watching
things
they
ain
t
in
he
told
me
specially
that
you
weren
t
to
be
around
except
when
you
re
working
you
see
he
s
using
you
in
kind
of
a
special
part
in
this
and
he
s
afraid
you
might
get
confused
if
you
watched
the
other
parts
i
guess
he
ll
start
you
you
re
to
be
in
a
good
wholesome
heart
play
you
ll
have
a
great
chance
in
well
i
ll
go
see
if
i
can
find
another
parmalee
picture
for
this
afternoon
say
you
don
t
think
i
was
too
much
like
him
in
that
scene
do
you
you
know
it
s
one
thing
if
i
look
like
him
i
can
t
help
that
but
i
shouldn
t
try
to
imitate
him
too
closely
should
i
i
got
to
think
about
my
own
individuality
haven
t
i
sure
sure
you
have
but
you
were
fine
your
imitation
wasn
t
a
bit
too
close
you
can
think
about
your
own
individuality
this
afternoon
when
you
re
watching
late
that
day
in
the
projection
room
baird
and
the
montague
girl
watched
the
rush
of
that
morning
s
episode
the
squirrel
s
done
it
whispered
the
girl
after
the
opening
scene
it
seemed
to
her
that
merton
gill
on
the
screen
might
overhear
her
comment
even
baird
was
looks
so
he
agreed
if
that
ain
t
parmalee
then
i
ll
eat
all
the
eggs
on
the
baird
rubbed
his
hands
it
s
parmalee
plus
he
corrected
oh
mother
mother
murmured
the
girl
while
the
screen
revealed
the
actor
studying
his
photographs
he
handled
all
right
in
that
spot
observed
baird
he
ll
handle
right
don
t
worry
ain
t
i
told
you
he
s
a
natural
born
trouper
the
mail
was
abandoned
in
humorous
despair
the
cigarette
lighted
in
a
flawless
parmalee
manner
the
smoke
idly
brushed
aside
poor
silly
little
girls
the
actor
was
seen
to
say
the
girl
gripped
baird
s
arm
until
he
winced
there
old
pippin
there
s
your
million
picked
right
up
on
the
lot
maybe
assented
the
cooler
baird
as
they
left
the
projection
room
and
say
asked
the
girl
did
you
notice
all
morning
how
he
didn
t
even
bat
an
eye
when
you
spoke
to
him
if
the
camera
was
still
turning
not
like
a
beginner
that
ll
nearly
always
look
up
and
get
out
of
the
what
i
bet
observed
baird
i
bet
he
d
a
done
that
album
stuff
even
better
than
he
did
if
i
d
actually
put
his
own
pictures
in
the
way
i
m
going
to
for
the
i
was
afraid
he
d
see
it
was
kidding
if
i
did
or
if
i
told
him
what
pictures
they
were
going
to
be
but
i
m
darned
now
if
i
don
t
think
he
d
have
stood
for
it
i
don
t
believe
you
ll
ever
be
able
to
peeve
that
boy
by
telling
him
he
s
the
girl
glanced
up
defensively
as
they
walked
now
don
t
get
the
idea
he
s
conceited
because
he
ain
t
not
one
how
do
you
know
he
ain
t
she
considered
this
then
explained
brightly
because
i
wouldn
t
like
him
if
he
was
no
no
now
you
listen
here
as
baird
had
grinned
this
lad
believes
in
himself
that
s
all
that
s
different
from
conceit
you
can
believe
a
whole
lot
in
yourself
and
still
be
as
modest
as
a
new
hatched
chicken
that
s
what
he
reminds
me
of
the
following
morning
baird
halted
him
outside
the
set
on
which
he
would
work
that
day
again
he
had
been
made
up
by
the
montague
girl
with
especial
attention
to
the
eyebrows
so
that
they
might
show
the
parmalee
lift
i
just
want
to
give
you
the
general
dope
of
the
piece
before
you
go
on
said
baird
in
the
shelter
of
high
canvas
backing
you
re
the
only
son
of
a
widowed
mother
and
both
you
and
she
are
toiling
to
pay
off
the
mortgage
on
the
little
home
you
re
the
cashier
of
this
business
establishment
and
in
love
with
the
proprietor
s
daughter
only
she
s
a
society
girl
and
kind
of
looks
down
on
you
at
first
then
there
s
her
brother
the
proprietor
s
only
son
he
s
the
clerk
in
this
place
he
doesn
t
want
to
work
but
his
father
has
made
him
learn
the
business
see
he
s
kind
of
a
dissipated
wears
flashy
clothes
and
plays
the
races
and
shoots
craps
and
drinks
you
try
to
reform
him
because
he
s
idolized
by
his
sister
that
you
re
in
love
with
but
you
can
t
do
a
thing
with
him
he
keeps
on
and
gets
in
with
a
rough
crowd
and
finally
he
steals
a
lot
of
money
out
of
the
safe
and
just
when
they
are
about
to
discover
that
he
s
the
thief
you
see
it
would
break
his
sister
s
heart
so
you
take
the
crime
on
your
own
shoulders
after
that
just
before
you
re
going
to
be
arrested
you
make
a
getaway
because
after
all
you
re
not
guilty
and
you
go
out
west
to
start
all
over
again
out
there
in
the
big
open
spaces
suggested
merton
who
had
listened
attentively
exactly
assented
baird
with
one
of
those
nervous
spasms
that
would
now
and
again
twitch
his
lips
and
chin
out
there
in
the
big
open
spaces
where
men
are
men
that
s
the
idea
and
you
build
up
a
little
gray
home
in
the
west
for
yourself
and
your
poor
old
mother
who
never
lost
faith
in
you
there
ll
be
a
lot
of
good
western
stuff
in
this
buck
benson
stuff
you
know
that
you
can
do
so
well
and
the
girl
will
get
out
there
some
way
and
tell
you
that
her
brother
finally
confessed
his
crime
and
everything
ll
be
jake
see
what
i
mean
yes
sir
it
sounds
fine
baird
and
i
certainly
will
give
the
best
that
is
in
me
to
this
he
had
an
impulse
to
tell
the
manager
too
how
gratified
he
was
that
one
who
had
been
content
with
the
low
humour
of
the
buckeye
comedies
should
at
last
have
been
won
over
to
the
better
form
of
photodrama
but
baird
was
leading
him
on
to
the
set
there
was
no
time
for
this
congratulatory
episode
indeed
the
impulse
was
swept
from
his
mind
in
the
novelty
of
the
set
now
exposed
and
in
the
thought
that
his
personality
was
to
dominate
it
the
scene
of
the
little
drama
s
unfolding
was
a
delicatessen
shop
counters
and
shelves
were
arrayed
with
cooked
foods
salads
cheeses
the
latter
under
glass
or
wire
protectors
at
the
back
was
a
cashier
s
desk
an
open
safe
beside
it
he
took
his
place
there
at
baird
s
direction
and
began
to
write
in
a
ledger
now
your
old
mother
s
coming
to
mop
up
the
place
called
baird
come
on
mother
you
look
up
and
see
her
and
rush
over
to
her
she
puts
down
her
bucket
and
mop
and
takes
you
in
her
arms
she
s
weeping
you
try
to
comfort
her
you
want
her
to
give
up
mopping
and
tell
her
you
can
make
enough
to
support
two
but
she
won
t
listen
because
there
s
the
mortgage
on
the
little
flat
to
be
paid
off
so
you
go
back
to
the
desk
stopping
to
give
her
a
sad
look
as
she
gets
down
on
the
floor
now
try
a
very
old
bent
feeble
woman
with
a
pail
of
water
and
cloths
tottered
on
her
dress
was
ragged
her
white
hair
hung
about
her
sad
old
face
in
disorderly
strands
she
set
down
her
bucket
and
raised
her
torn
apron
to
her
eyes
look
up
and
see
her
called
baird
a
glad
light
comes
into
her
eyes
rush
forward
say
mother
distinctly
so
it
ll
show
now
the
clench
you
re
crying
on
his
shoulder
mother
and
he
s
looking
down
at
you
first
then
off
about
at
me
he
s
near
crying
himself
now
he
s
telling
you
to
give
up
mopping
places
and
you
re
telling
him
every
little
helps
all
right
break
get
to
mopping
mother
but
keep
on
crying
he
stops
for
a
long
look
at
you
he
seems
to
be
saying
that
some
day
he
will
take
you
out
of
such
work
now
he
s
back
at
his
desk
all
right
but
we
ll
do
it
once
more
and
a
little
more
pathos
merton
when
you
take
the
old
lady
in
your
arms
you
can
broaden
it
you
don
t
actually
break
down
but
you
nearly
the
scene
was
rehearsed
again
to
baird
s
satisfaction
and
the
cameras
ground
merton
gill
gave
the
best
that
was
in
him
his
glad
look
at
first
beholding
the
old
lady
the
yearning
of
his
eyes
when
his
arms
opened
to
enfold
her
the
tenderness
of
his
embrace
as
he
murmured
soothing
words
the
lingering
touch
of
his
hand
as
he
left
her
the
manly
determination
of
the
last
look
in
which
he
showed
a
fresh
resolve
to
release
her
from
this
toil
all
were
eloquent
of
the
deepest
filial
devotion
and
earnestness
of
purpose
back
at
his
desk
he
was
genuinely
pitying
the
old
lady
very
lately
it
was
evident
she
had
been
compelled
to
play
in
a
cabaret
scene
for
she
smelled
strongly
of
cigarettes
and
he
could
not
suppose
that
she
her
eyes
brimming
with
anguished
mother
love
could
have
relished
these
he
was
glad
when
it
presently
developed
that
his
own
was
not
to
be
a
smoking
part
now
the
dissipated
brother
s
coming
on
explained
baird
he
ll
breeze
in
hang
up
his
hat
offer
you
a
cigarette
which
you
refuse
and
show
you
some
money
that
he
won
on
the
third
race
yesterday
you
follow
him
a
little
way
from
the
desk
telling
him
he
shouldn
t
smoke
cigarettes
and
that
money
he
gets
by
gambling
will
never
do
him
any
good
he
laughs
at
you
but
you
don
t
mind
on
your
way
back
to
the
desk
you
stop
by
your
mother
and
she
gets
up
and
embraces
you
again
take
your
time
about
it
she
s
your
mother
the
brother
entered
he
was
indeed
dissipated
appearing
loudly
dressed
and
already
smoking
a
cigarette
as
he
swaggered
the
length
of
the
shop
to
offer
merton
one
merton
refused
in
a
kindly
but
firm
manner
the
flashy
brother
now
pulled
a
roll
of
bills
from
his
pocket
and
pointed
to
his
winning
horse
in
a
racing
extra
the
line
in
large
type
was
there
for
the
pianola
romps
home
in
third
followed
the
scene
in
which
merton
sought
to
show
this
youth
that
cigarettes
and
gambling
would
harm
him
the
youth
remained
obdurate
he
seized
a
duster
and
with
ribald
action
began
to
dust
off
the
rows
of
cooked
food
on
the
counters
again
the
son
stopped
to
embrace
his
mother
who
again
wept
as
she
enfolded
him
the
scene
was
shot
step
by
step
under
the
patient
coaching
of
baird
the
simple
drama
unfolded
it
was
hot
beneath
the
lights
delays
were
frequent
and
the
rehearsals
tedious
yet
merton
gill
continued
to
give
the
best
that
was
in
him
as
the
day
wore
on
the
dissipated
son
went
from
bad
to
worse
he
would
leave
the
shop
to
place
money
on
a
horse
race
and
he
would
seek
to
induce
the
customers
he
waited
on
to
play
at
dice
with
him
a
few
of
them
consented
and
one
a
coloured
man
who
had
come
to
purchase
pigs
won
at
this
game
all
the
bills
which
the
youth
had
shown
to
merton
on
entering
there
were
moments
during
this
scene
when
merton
wondered
if
baird
were
not
relapsing
into
buckeye
comedy
depths
but
he
saw
the
inevitable
trend
of
the
drama
and
the
justification
for
this
bit
of
gambling
for
the
son
now
penniless
became
desperate
he
appealed
to
merton
for
a
loan
urging
it
on
the
ground
that
he
had
a
sure
thing
thirty
shot
at
latonia
at
least
these
were
the
words
of
baird
as
he
directed
merton
to
deny
the
request
and
to
again
try
to
save
the
youth
from
his
inevitable
downfall
whereupon
the
youth
had
sneered
at
merton
and
left
the
place
in
deep
anger
there
followed
the
scene
with
the
boy
s
sister
only
daughter
of
the
rich
delicatessen
merchant
who
merton
was
pleased
to
discover
would
be
played
by
the
montague
girl
she
entered
in
a
splendid
evening
gown
almost
too
splendid
merton
thought
for
street
wear
in
daylight
though
it
was
partially
concealed
by
a
rich
opera
cloak
the
brother
being
out
merton
came
forward
to
wait
upon
her
it
s
like
this
baird
explained
she
s
just
a
simple
new
york
society
girl
kind
of
shallow
and
heartless
because
she
has
never
been
aroused
nor
anything
see
you
re
the
first
one
that
s
really
touched
her
heart
but
she
hesitates
because
her
father
expects
her
to
marry
a
count
and
she
s
come
to
get
the
food
for
a
swell
banquet
they
re
giving
for
him
she
says
where
s
her
brother
and
if
anything
happened
to
him
it
would
break
her
heart
then
she
orders
what
she
wants
and
you
do
it
up
for
her
looking
at
her
all
the
time
as
if
you
thought
she
was
the
one
girl
in
the
world
she
kind
of
falls
for
you
a
little
bit
still
she
is
afraid
of
what
her
father
would
say
then
you
get
bolder
see
you
come
from
behind
the
counter
and
begin
to
make
love
talking
as
you
come
out
miss
hoffmeyer
i
have
loved
you
since
the
day
i
first
set
eyes
on
you
i
have
nothing
to
offer
but
the
love
of
an
honest
man
she
s
falling
for
it
see
so
you
get
up
close
and
grab
her
stuff
do
a
good
hard
clench
she
s
yours
at
last
she
just
naturally
sags
right
down
on
to
you
you
ve
got
her
do
a
regular
parmalee
take
your
time
you
re
going
to
kiss
her
and
kiss
her
right
but
just
as
you
get
down
to
it
the
father
busts
in
and
says
what
s
the
meaning
of
this
so
you
fly
apart
and
the
father
says
you
re
discharged
because
his
daughter
is
the
affianced
wife
of
this
count
aspirin
see
then
he
goes
back
to
the
safe
and
finds
all
the
money
has
been
taken
because
the
son
has
sneaked
in
and
grabbed
out
the
bundle
and
hid
it
in
the
on
his
way
out
taking
only
a
few
bills
to
get
down
on
a
horse
so
he
says
call
the
police
but
that
s
enough
for
now
go
ahead
and
do
that
love
scene
for
slowly
the
scene
was
brought
to
baird
s
liking
slowly
because
merton
gill
at
first
proved
to
be
diffident
at
the
crisis
for
three
rehearsals
the
muscular
arm
of
miss
montague
had
most
of
the
clenching
to
do
he
believed
he
was
being
rough
and
masterful
but
baird
wished
a
greater
show
of
violence
they
had
also
to
time
this
scene
with
the
surreptitious
entrance
of
the
brother
his
theft
of
the
money
which
he
stuffed
into
a
paper
sack
and
placed
in
the
and
his
exit
the
leading
man
having
at
last
proved
that
he
could
be
harold
parmalee
even
in
this
crisis
the
scene
was
extended
to
the
entrance
of
the
indignant
father
he
was
one
of
those
men
of
wealth
merton
thought
a
short
stout
gentleman
with
fiery
whiskers
not
at
all
fashionably
dressed
he
broke
upon
the
embrace
with
a
threatening
stick
the
pair
separated
the
young
lover
facing
him
proud
erect
defiant
the
girl
drooping
and
confused
the
father
discharged
merton
gill
with
great
brutality
then
went
to
the
safe
at
the
back
of
the
room
returning
to
shout
the
news
that
he
had
been
robbed
by
the
man
who
would
have
robbed
him
of
his
daughter
it
looked
black
for
merton
puzzled
at
first
he
now
saw
that
the
idolized
brother
of
the
girl
must
have
taken
the
money
he
seemed
about
to
declare
this
when
his
nobler
nature
compelled
him
to
a
silence
that
must
be
taken
for
guilt
the
erring
brother
returned
accompanied
by
several
customers
bring
a
detective
to
arrest
this
man
ordered
the
father
one
of
the
customers
stepped
out
to
return
with
a
detective
again
merton
was
slightly
disquieted
at
perceiving
that
the
detective
was
the
man
this
person
bustled
about
the
place
tapping
the
cooked
meats
and
the
cheeses
and
at
last
placed
his
hand
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
supposed
thief
merton
at
baird
s
direction
drew
back
and
threatened
him
with
a
blow
the
detective
cringed
and
said
i
will
go
out
and
call
a
the
others
now
turned
their
backs
upon
the
guilty
man
even
the
girl
drew
away
after
one
long
agonized
look
at
the
lover
to
whose
embrace
she
had
so
lately
submitted
he
raised
his
arms
to
her
in
mute
appeal
as
she
moved
away
then
dropped
them
at
his
side
give
her
all
you
got
in
a
look
directed
baird
you
re
saying
i
go
to
a
felon
s
cell
but
i
do
it
all
for
dream
your
eyes
at
merton
gill
obeyed
the
action
progressed
in
this
wait
for
the
policeman
the
old
mother
crept
forward
she
explained
to
merton
that
the
money
was
in
the
where
the
real
thief
had
placed
it
and
since
he
had
taken
the
crime
of
another
upon
his
shoulders
he
should
also
take
the
evidence
lest
the
unfortunate
young
man
be
later
convicted
by
that
she
also
urged
him
to
fly
by
the
rear
door
while
there
was
yet
time
he
did
these
things
pausing
for
a
last
embrace
of
the
weeping
old
lady
even
as
the
hand
of
the
arriving
policeman
was
upon
the
door
all
for
except
some
announced
baird
when
this
scene
had
been
shot
there
was
a
breaking
up
of
the
group
a
relaxation
of
that
dramatic
tension
which
the
of
the
piece
had
imposed
only
once
while
merton
was
doing
some
of
his
best
acting
had
there
been
a
kind
of
wheezy
tittering
from
certain
members
of
the
cast
and
the
group
about
the
cameras
baird
had
quickly
suppressed
this
if
there
s
any
kidding
in
this
piece
it
s
all
in
my
part
he
announced
in
cold
clear
tones
and
there
had
been
no
further
signs
of
levity
merton
was
pleased
by
this
manner
of
baird
s
it
showed
that
he
was
finely
in
earnest
in
the
effort
for
the
things
and
baird
now
congratulated
him
seconded
by
the
montague
girl
he
had
they
told
him
been
all
that
could
be
expected
i
wasn
t
sure
of
myself
he
told
them
in
one
scene
and
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
it
baird
it
s
where
i
take
that
money
from
the
and
go
out
with
it
i
couldn
t
make
myself
feel
right
wouldn
t
it
look
to
other
people
as
if
i
was
actually
stealing
it
myself
why
couldn
t
i
put
it
back
in
the
safe
baird
listened
respectfully
considering
i
think
not
he
announced
at
length
you
d
hardly
have
time
for
that
and
you
have
a
better
plan
it
ll
be
brought
out
in
the
subtitles
of
course
you
are
going
to
leave
it
at
the
residence
of
hoffmeyer
where
it
will
be
safe
you
see
if
you
put
it
back
where
it
was
his
son
might
steal
it
again
we
thought
that
out
very
i
see
said
merton
i
wish
i
had
been
told
that
i
feel
that
i
could
have
done
that
bit
a
lot
better
i
felt
kind
of
you
did
it
perfectly
baird
assured
him
kid
you
re
a
wonder
declared
the
montague
girl
i
m
that
tickled
with
you
i
could
give
you
a
good
hug
and
with
that
curious
approach
to
hysteria
she
had
shown
while
looking
at
his
stills
she
for
a
moment
frantically
clasped
him
to
her
he
was
somewhat
embarrassed
by
this
excess
but
pardoned
it
in
the
reflection
that
he
had
indeed
given
the
best
that
was
in
him
bring
all
your
western
stuff
to
the
dressing
room
tomorrow
said
baird
western
stuff
the
real
thing
at
last
he
was
slightly
amazed
later
to
observe
the
old
mother
outside
the
set
she
was
not
only
smoking
a
cigarette
with
every
sign
of
relish
but
she
was
singing
as
she
did
a
little
dance
step
still
she
had
been
under
a
strain
all
day
weeping
too
almost
continuously
he
remembered
this
and
did
not
judge
her
harshly
as
she
smoked
danced
and
lightly
sang
her
mother
s
name
was
cleo
her
father
s
name
was
pat
they
called
her
cleopatra
and
let
it
go
at
that
chapter
xiv
out
there
where
men
are
men
from
the
dressing
room
the
following
morning
arrayed
in
the
buck
benson
outfit
unworn
since
that
eventful
day
on
the
gashwiler
lot
merton
accompanied
baird
to
a
new
set
where
he
would
work
that
day
baird
was
profuse
in
his
admiration
of
the
cowboy
embellishments
the
maroon
chaps
the

boots
the
hat
the
checked
shirt
and
gay
neckerchief
i
m
mighty
glad
to
see
you
so
sincere
in
your
work
he
assured
merton
a
lot
of
these
hams
i
hire
get
to
kidding
on
the
set
and
spoil
the
atmosphere
but
don
t
let
it
bother
you
one
earnest
leading
man
if
he
ll
just
stay
earnest
will
carry
the
piece
remember
that
you
got
a
serious
i
ll
certainly
remember
merton
earnestly
assured
him
here
we
are
this
is
where
we
begin
the
western
stuff
said
baird
merton
recognized
the
place
it
was
the
high
gear
dance
hall
where
the
montague
girl
had
worked
the
name
over
the
door
was
now
the
come
all
ye
and
there
was
a
hitching
rack
in
front
to
which
were
tethered
dozen
saddled
horses
inside
the
scene
was
set
as
he
remembered
it
tables
for
drinking
were
about
the
floor
and
there
was
a
roulette
wheel
at
one
side
a
bartender
his
hair
plastered
low
over
his
brow
leaned
negligently
on
the
bar
scattered
around
the
room
were
girls
in
short
skirts
and
a
number
of
cowboys
first
i
ll
wise
you
up
a
little
bit
said
baird
you
ve
come
out
here
to
work
on
a
ranche
in
the
great
open
spaces
and
these
cowboys
all
love
you
and
come
to
town
with
you
every
time
and
they
ll
stand
by
you
when
the
detective
from
new
york
gets
here
now
let
s
see
i
guess
first
we
ll
get
your
entrance
you
come
in
the
front
door
at
the
head
of
them
you
ve
ridden
in
from
the
ranche
we
get
the
horseback
stuff
later
you
all
come
in
yelling
and
so
on
and
the
boys
scatter
some
to
the
bar
and
some
to
the
wheel
and
some
sit
down
to
the
tables
to
have
their
drinks
and
some
dance
with
the
girls
you
distribute
money
to
them
from
a
paper
sack
here
s
the
from
a
waiting
property
boy
he
took
a
paper
sack
put
this
in
your
pocket
and
take
it
out
whenever
you
need
money
it
s
the
same
sack
see
that
the
kid
put
the
stolen
money
in
and
you
saved
it
after
returning
the
money
it
s
just
a
kind
of
an
idea
of
mine
he
vaguely
added
as
merton
looked
puzzled
at
this
all
right
he
took
the
sack
observing
it
to
contain
a
rude
imitation
of
bills
and
stuffed
it
into
his
pocket
then
after
the
boys
scatter
around
you
go
stand
at
the
end
of
the
bar
you
don
t
join
in
their
sports
and
pastimes
see
you
re
serious
you
have
things
on
your
mind
just
sort
of
look
around
the
place
as
if
you
were
holding
yourself
above
such
things
even
if
you
do
like
to
give
the
boys
a
good
time
now
we
ll
try
the
cameras
were
put
into
place
and
merton
gill
led
through
the
front
door
his
band
of
rollicking
good
fellows
he
paused
inside
to
give
them
bills
from
the
paper
sack
they
scattered
to
their
dissipations
their
leader
austerely
posed
at
one
end
of
the
bar
and
regarded
the
scene
with
disapproving
eyes
wine
women
and
the
dance
were
not
for
him
he
produced
again
the
disillusioned
look
that
had
won
henshaw
fine
said
baird
gun
it
the
scene
was
shot
and
baird
spoke
again
hold
it
everybody
go
on
with
your
music
and
you
boys
keep
up
the
dance
until
mother
s
entrance
then
you
quit
and
back
merton
was
puzzled
by
this
speech
but
continued
his
superior
look
breaking
it
with
a
very
genuine
shock
of
surprise
when
his
old
mother
tottered
in
at
the
front
door
she
was
still
the
disconsolate
creature
of
the
day
before
bedraggled
feeble
very
aged
and
still
she
carried
her
bucket
and
the
bundle
of
rags
with
which
she
had
mopped
baird
came
forward
again
oh
i
forgot
to
tell
you
of
course
you
had
your
old
mother
follow
you
out
here
to
the
great
open
spaces
but
the
poor
old
thing
has
cracked
under
the
strain
of
her
hard
life
see
what
i
mean
all
her
dear
ones
have
been
leaving
the
old
nest
and
going
out
over
the
hills
one
by
were
the
last
to
now
she
isn
t
quite
right
see
you
have
a
good
home
on
the
ranche
for
her
but
she
won
t
stay
put
she
follows
you
around
and
the
only
thing
that
keeps
her
quiet
is
mopping
so
you
humour
her
you
let
her
mop
it
s
the
only
way
but
of
course
it
makes
you
sad
you
look
at
her
now
then
go
up
and
hug
her
the
way
you
did
yesterday
you
try
to
get
her
to
give
up
mopping
but
she
won
t
so
you
let
her
go
on
try
merton
went
forward
to
embrace
his
old
mother
here
was
tragedy
indeed
a
bit
of
biting
pathos
from
a
humble
life
he
gave
the
best
that
was
in
him
as
he
enfolded
the
feeble
old
woman
and
strained
her
to
his
breast
murmuring
to
her
that
she
must
give
it
it
up
the
old
lady
wept
but
was
stubborn
she
tore
herself
from
his
arms
and
knelt
on
the
floor
i
just
got
to
mop
i
just
got
to
mop
she
was
repeating
in
a
cracked
voice
if
i
ain
t
let
to
mop
i
git
rough
till
i
m
simply
a
it
was
an
affecting
scene
marred
only
by
one
explosive
bit
of
coarse
laughter
from
an
observing
cowboy
at
the
close
of
the
old
mother
s
speech
merton
gill
glanced
up
in
sharp
annoyance
at
this
offender
baird
was
quick
in
rebuke
the
next
guy
that
laughs
at
this
pathos
can
get
off
the
set
he
announced
glaring
at
the
assemblage
there
was
no
further
outbreak
and
the
scene
was
filmed
there
followed
a
dramatic
bit
that
again
involved
the
demented
mother
this
ought
to
be
good
if
you
can
do
it
the
right
way
began
baird
mother
s
mopping
along
there
and
slashes
some
water
on
this
mexican
s
are
you
pedro
come
here
and
get
this
the
old
lady
sloshes
water
on
you
while
you
re
playing
monte
here
so
you
yell
carramba
or
something
and
kick
at
her
you
don
t
land
on
her
of
course
but
her
son
rushes
up
and
grabs
your
arm
here
do
it
this
baird
demonstrated
grab
his
wrist
with
one
hand
and
his
elbow
with
the
other
and
make
as
if
you
broke
his
arm
across
your
know
like
you
were
doing
joojitsey
he
slinks
off
with
his
broken
arm
and
you
just
dust
your
hands
off
and
embrace
your
mother
again
then
you
go
back
to
the
bar
not
looking
at
pedro
at
all
see
he
s
insulted
your
mother
and
you
ve
resented
it
in
a
nice
dignified
gentlemanly
way
try
pedro
sat
at
the
table
and
picked
up
his
cards
he
was
a
mexican
and
seemed
capable
even
of
the
enormity
he
was
about
to
commit
the
scene
was
rehearsed
to
baird
s
satisfaction
then
shot
the
weeping
old
lady
blinded
by
her
tears
awkward
with
her
mop
the
brutal
mexican
his
prompt
punishment
the
old
lady
was
especially
pathetic
as
she
glared
at
her
insulter
from
where
she
lay
sprawled
on
the
floor
and
muttered
carramba
huh
i
dare
you
to
come
outside
and
say
that
to
me
good
work
applauded
baird
when
the
scene
was
finished
now
we
re
getting
into
the
swing
of
it
in
about
three
days
here
we
ll
have
something
that
exhibitors
can
clean
up
on
see
if
we
don
the
three
days
passed
in
what
for
merton
gill
was
a
whirlwind
of
dramatic
intensity
if
at
times
he
was
vaguely
disquieted
by
a
suspicion
that
the
piece
was
not
wholly
serious
he
had
only
to
remember
the
intense
seriousness
of
his
own
part
and
the
always
serious
manner
of
baird
in
directing
his
actors
and
indeed
there
were
but
few
moments
when
he
was
even
faintly
pricked
by
this
suspicion
it
seemed
a
bit
incongruous
that
hoffmeyer
the
delicatessen
merchant
should
arrive
on
a
bicycle
dressed
in
cowboy
attire
save
for
a
badly
dented
derby
hat
and
carrying
a
bag
of
golf
clubs
and
it
was
a
little
puzzling
how
hoffmeyer
should
have
been
ruined
by
his
son
s
mad
act
when
it
would
have
been
shown
that
the
money
was
returned
to
him
but
baird
explained
carefully
that
the
old
man
had
been
ruined
some
other
way
and
was
demented
like
the
poor
old
mother
who
had
gone
over
the
hills
after
her
children
had
left
the
home
nest
and
assuredly
in
merton
s
own
action
he
found
nothing
that
was
not
deeply
earnest
as
well
as
strikingly
dramatic
there
was
the
tense
moment
when
a
faithful
cowboy
broke
upon
the
festivities
with
word
that
a
new
york
detective
was
coming
to
search
for
the
man
who
had
robbed
the
hoffmeyer
establishment
his
friends
gathered
loyally
about
merton
and
swore
he
would
never
be
taken
from
them
alive
he
was
induced
to
don
a
false
mustache
until
the
detective
had
gone
it
was
a
long
heavy
black
mustache
with
curling
tips
and
in
this
disguise
he
stood
aloof
from
his
companions
when
the
detective
entered
the
detective
was
the
man
himself
now
disguised
as
sherlock
holmes
with
a
cloth
cap
and
drooping
blond
mustache
he
smoked
a
pipe
as
he
examined
those
present
merton
was
unable
to
overlook
this
scene
as
he
had
been
directed
to
stand
with
his
back
to
the
detective
later
it
was
shown
that
he
observed
in
a
mirror
the
mexican
whom
he
had
punished
creeping
forward
to
inform
the
detective
of
his
man
s
whereabouts
the
coward
s
treachery
cost
him
dearly
the
hero
still
with
his
back
turned
drew
his
revolver
and
took
careful
aim
by
means
of
the
mirror
this
had
been
a
spot
where
for
a
moment
he
was
troubled
instead
of
pointing
the
weapon
over
his
shoulder
aiming
by
the
mirror
he
was
directed
to
point
it
at
the
mexican
s
reflection
in
the
glass
and
to
fire
at
this
reflection
it
s
all
right
baird
assured
him
it
s
a
camera
trick
see
it
may
look
now
as
if
you
were
shooting
into
the
mirror
but
it
comes
perfectly
right
on
the
film
you
ll
see
go
on
aim
carefully
right
smack
at
that
fire
still
somewhat
doubting
merton
fired
the
mirror
was
shattered
but
a
dozen
feet
back
of
him
the
treacherous
mexican
threw
up
his
arms
and
fell
lifeless
a
bullet
through
his
cowardly
heart
it
was
a
puzzling
bit
of
he
thought
but
baird
of
course
would
know
what
was
right
so
the
puzzle
was
dismissed
buck
benson
silent
man
of
the
open
had
got
the
scoundrel
who
would
have
played
him
false
a
thrilling
struggle
ensued
between
merton
and
the
hellhound
of
justice
perceiving
who
had
slain
his
informant
the
detective
came
to
confront
merton
snatching
off
his
cap
and
mustache
he
stood
revealed
as
the
man
who
had
not
dared
to
arrest
him
at
the
scene
of
his
crime
with
another
swift
movement
he
snatched
away
the
mustache
that
had
disguised
his
quarry
buck
benson
at
bay
sprang
like
a
tiger
upon
his
antagonist
they
struggled
while
the
excited
cowboys
surged
about
them
the
detective
proved
to
be
no
match
for
benson
he
was
borne
to
earth
then
raised
aloft
and
hurled
over
the
adjacent
tables
this
bit
of
acting
had
involved
a
trick
which
was
not
obscure
to
merton
like
his
shot
into
the
mirror
that
brought
down
a
man
back
of
him
moreover
it
was
a
trick
of
which
he
approved
when
he
bore
the
detective
to
earth
the
cameras
halted
their
grinding
while
a
dummy
in
the
striking
likeness
of
the
detective
was
substituted
it
was
a
light
affair
and
he
easily
raised
it
for
the
final
toss
of
triumph
throw
it
high
as
you
can
over
those
tables
and
toward
the
bar
called
baird
the
figure
was
thrown
as
directed
fine
work
now
look
up
as
if
he
was
still
in
the
air
now
down
now
brush
your
left
sleeve
lightly
with
your
right
hand
now
brush
your
right
sleeve
lightly
with
your
left
hand
all
right
cut
great
merton
if
that
don
t
get
you
a
hand
i
don
t
know
what
will
now
all
outside
for
the
horseback
stuff
outside
the
faithful
cowboys
leaped
into
their
saddles
and
urged
their
beloved
leader
to
do
the
same
but
he
lingered
beside
his
own
horse
pleading
with
them
to
go
ahead
he
must
remain
in
the
place
of
danger
yet
awhile
for
he
had
forgotten
to
bring
out
his
old
mother
they
besought
him
to
let
them
bring
her
out
but
he
would
not
listen
his
alone
was
the
task
reluctantly
the
cowboys
galloped
off
as
he
turned
to
the
he
was
confronted
by
the
detective
who
held
two
frowning
weapons
upon
him
benson
was
at
last
a
prisoner
the
detective
brutally
ordered
his
quarry
inside
benson
seeing
he
was
beaten
made
a
manly
plea
that
he
might
be
let
to
bid
his
horse
the
detective
seemed
moved
he
relented
benson
went
to
his
good
old
pal
here
s
your
chance
for
a
fine
bit
called
baird
give
it
to
us
now
the
way
you
did
in
that
still
broaden
it
all
you
want
to
go
to
well
did
merton
gill
know
that
here
was
his
chance
for
a
fine
bit
the
horse
was
strangely
like
dexter
upon
whom
he
had
so
often
rehearsed
this
bit
he
was
a
bony
drooping
sad
horse
with
a
thin
neck
they
re
takin
ye
frum
me
old
pal
takin
ye
frum
me
you
an
me
has
seen
some
tough
times

i
sort
o
figgered
we

keep
on
together
till
the
last
an
now
they
got

far
away
where
ye
won
t
see
me
no
more
go
to
it
cowboy
take
all
the
footage
you
want
called
baird
in
a
curiously
choked
voice
the
actor
took
some
more
footage
but
we
got
to
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
old
pal
you
and
me
both
no
cryin
no
bustin
down
we
had
our
last
gallop
together
an
we
re
at
the
forkin
of
th
trail
so
we
got
to
be
brave
we
got
to
stand
the
benson
released
his
old
pal
stood
erect
dashed
a
bit
of
moisture
from
his
eyes
and
turned
to
the
waiting
detective
who
it
seemed
had
also
been
strangely
moved
during
this
affecting
farewell
yet
he
had
not
forgotten
his
duty
benson
was
forced
to
march
back
into
the
come
all
ye
dance
hall
as
he
went
he
was
wishing
that
baird
would
have
him
escape
and
flee
on
his
old
pal
and
baird
was
a
man
who
seemed
to
think
of
everything
or
perhaps
he
had
often
seen
the
real
buck
benson
s
play
for
it
now
appeared
that
everything
was
going
to
be
as
merton
gill
wished
baird
had
even
contrived
an
escape
that
was
highly
spectacular
locked
by
the
detective
in
an
upper
room
the
prisoner
went
to
the
window
and
glanced
out
to
find
that
his
loyal
horse
was
directly
beneath
him
he
would
leap
from
the
window
alight
in
the
saddle
after
a
drop
and
be
off
over
the
border
the
window
scene
was
shot
including
a
flash
of
the
horse
below
the
mechanics
of
the
leap
itself
required
more
time
indeed
it
took
the
better
part
of
a
morning
to
satisfy
baird
that
this
thrilling
exploit
had
been
properly
achieved
from
a
lower
window
quite
like
the
high
one
merton
leaped
but
only
to
the
ground
a
few
feet
below
that
s
where
we
get
your
baird
explained
now
we
get
you
lighting
in
the
this
proved
to
be
a
more
delicate
bit
of
work
from
a
platform
built
out
just
above
the
faithful
horse
merton
precariously
scrambled
down
into
the
saddle
he
glanced
anxiously
at
baird
fearing
he
had
not
alighted
properly
after
the
supposed
drop
but
the
manager
appeared
to
be
delighted
with
his
prowess
after
the
one
rehearsal
and
the
scene
was
shot
it
s
all
jake
baird
assured
him
don
t
feel
worried
of
course
we
ll
trick
the
bit
where
you
hit
the
saddle
the
camera
ll
look
out
for
one
detail
only
troubled
merton
after
doing
the
leap
from
the
high
window
and
before
doing
its
finish
where
he
reached
the
saddle
baird
directed
certain
changes
in
his
costume
he
was
again
to
don
the
false
mustache
to
put
his
hat
on
and
also
a
heavy
jacket
lined
with
sheep
s
wool
worn
by
one
of
the
cowboys
in
the
merton
was
pleased
to
believe
he
had
caught
the
manager
napping
here
but
baird
if
i
leap
from
the
window
without
the
hat
or
mustache
or
jacket
and
land
on
my
horse
in
them
wouldn
t
it
look
as
if
i
had
put
them
on
as
i
was
falling
baird
was
instantly
overcome
with
confusion
now
that
s
so
i
swear
i
never
thought
of
that
merton
i
m
glad
you
spoke
about
it
in
time
you
sure
have
shown
me
up
as
a
director
you
see
i
wanted
you
to
disguise
yourself
again
i
ll
tell
you
get
the
things
on
and
after
we
shoot
you
lighting
in
the
saddle
we
ll
retake
the
window
scene
that
ll
fix
not
until
long
afterward
on
a
certain
dread
night
when
the
earth
was
to
rock
beneath
him
did
he
recall
that
baird
had
never
retaken
that
window
scene
at
present
the
young
actor
was
too
engrossed
by
the
details
of
his
daring
leap
to
remember
small
things
the
leap
was
achieved
at
last
he
was
in
the
saddle
after
a
drop
he
gathered
up
the
reins
the
horse
beneath
him
coughed
plaintively
and
merton
rode
him
out
of
the
picture
baird
took
a
load
off
his
mind
as
to
this
bit
of
riding
will
you
want
me
to
gallop
he
asked
recalling
the
unhappy
experience
with
dexter
no
just
walk
him
beyond
the
camera
line
the
camera
ll
trick
it
up
all
so
safely
confidently
he
had
ridden
his
steed
beyond
the
lens
range
at
a
curious
shuffling
amble
and
his
work
at
the
come
all
ye
dance
hall
was
done
then
came
some
adventurous
days
in
the
open
in
motor
cars
the
company
of
artists
was
transported
to
a
sunny
nook
in
the
foothills
beyond
the
city
and
here
in
the
wild
rough
open
spaces
the
drama
of
sacrifice
and
thrills
was
further
unfolded
first
to
be
done
here
was
the
continuation
of
the
hero
s
escape
from
the
upon
his
faithful
horse
he
ambled
along
a
quiet
road
until
he
reached
the
shelter
of
an
oak
tree
here
he
halted
at
the
roadside
you
know
the
detective
is
following
you
explained
baird
and
you
re
going
to
get
him
take
your
nag
over
a
little
so
the
tree
won
t
mask
him
too
much
that
s
it
now
you
look
back
lean
forward
in
the
saddle
listen
you
hear
him
coming
your
face
sets
look
as
grim
as
you
can
that
s
the
stuff
the
real
buck
benson
stuff
when
they
re
after
him
that
s
fine
now
you
get
an
idea
unlash
your
rope
let
the
noose
out
give
it
a
couple
of
whirls
to
see
is
everything
all
right
that
s
it
only
you
still
look
grim
not
so
worried
about
whether
the
rope
is
going
to
act
right
we
ll
attend
to
that
when
the
detective
comes
in
sight
give
about
three
good
whirls
and
let
her
fly
try
it
once
good
now
coil
her
up
again
and
go
through
the
whole
thing
never
mind
about
whether
you
re
going
to
get
him
or
not
remember
buck
benson
never
misses
we
ll
have
a
later
shot
that
shows
the
rope
falling
over
his
thereupon
the
benson
strong
silent
man
of
the
open
while
the
cameras
ground
waited
the
coming
of
one
who
hounded
him
for
a
crime
of
which
he
was
innocent
his
iron
face
was
relentless
he
leaned
forward
listening
he
uncoiled
the
rope
expertly
ran
out
the
noose
and
grimly
waited
far
up
the
road
appeared
the
detective
on
a
galloping
horse
benson
twirled
the
rope
as
he
sat
in
his
saddle
it
left
his
hand
to
sail
gracefully
in
the
general
direction
of
his
pursuer
cut
called
baird
that
was
bully
now
you
got
him
ride
out
into
the
road
you
re
dragging
him
off
his
horse
see
keep
on
up
the
road
you
re
still
dragging
the
hound
look
back
over
your
shoulder
and
light
your
face
up
just
a
little
that
s
it
use
benson
s
other
expression
you
got
it
fine
you
re
treating
the
skunk
rough
but
look
what
he
was
doing
to
you
trying
to
pinch
you
for
something
you
never
did
that
s
fine
go
ahead
don
t
look
back
any
merton
was
chiefly
troubled
at
this
moment
by
the
thought
that
someone
would
have
to
double
for
him
in
the
actual
casting
of
the
rope
that
would
settle
upon
the
detective
s
shoulders
well
he
must
practise
roping
perhaps
by
the
next
picture
he
could
do
this
stuff
himself
it
was
exciting
work
though
sometimes
tedious
it
had
required
almost
an
entire
morning
to
enact
this
one
simple
scene
with
the
numerous
that
baird
demanded
the
afternoon
was
taken
up
largely
in
becoming
accustomed
to
a
pair
of
old
spanish
spurs
that
baird
now
provided
him
with
baird
said
they
were
very
rare
old
spurs
which
he
had
obtained
at
a
fancy
price
from
an
impoverished
spanish
family
who
had
treasured
them
as
heirlooms
he
said
he
was
sure
that
buck
benson
in
all
his
vast
collection
did
not
possess
a
pair
of
spurs
like
these
he
would
doubtless
after
seeing
them
worn
by
merton
gill
in
this
picture
have
a
pair
made
like
them
the
distinguishing
feature
of
these
spurs
was
their
size
they
were
enormous
and
their
rowels
extended
a
good
twelve
inches
from
merton
s
heels
after
he
had
donned
them
they
may
bother
you
a
little
at
first
said
baird
but
you
ll
get
used
to
them
and
they
re
worth
a
little
trouble
because
they
ll
stand
the
first
effort
to
walk
in
them
proved
bothersome
indeed
for
it
was
made
over
ground
covered
with
a
vine
and
the
spurs
caught
in
this
baird
was
very
earnest
in
supervising
this
progress
and
even
demanded
the
presence
of
two
cameras
to
record
it
of
course
i
m
not
using
this
stuff
he
said
but
i
want
to
make
a
careful
study
of
it
these
are
genuine
hidalgo
spurs
mighty
few
men
in
this
line
of
parts
could
get
away
with
them
i
bet
benson
himself
would
have
a
lot
of
trouble
now
try
it
once
merton
tried
once
more
stumbling
as
the
spurs
caught
in
the
undergrowth
the
cameras
closely
recorded
his
efforts
and
baird
applauded
them
you
re
getting
it
keep
on
that
s
better
now
try
to
run
a
few
steps
go
right
toward
that
he
ran
the
few
steps
but
fell
headlong
he
picked
himself
up
an
expression
of
chagrin
on
his
face
never
mind
urged
baird
try
it
again
we
must
get
this
he
tried
again
to
run
was
again
thrown
but
he
was
determined
to
please
the
manager
and
he
earnestly
continued
his
efforts
benson
himself
would
see
the
picture
and
probably
marvel
that
a
new
man
should
have
mastered
apparently
with
ease
a
pair
of
genuine
hidalgos
maybe
we
better
try
smoother
ground
baird
at
last
suggested
after
repeated
falls
had
shown
that
the
undergrowth
was
difficult
so
the
cameras
were
moved
on
to
the
front
of
a
ranche
house
now
in
use
for
the
drama
and
the
spur
lessons
continued
but
on
smooth
ground
it
appeared
that
the
spurs
were
still
troublesome
after
the
first
mishap
here
merton
discovered
the
cause
the
long
shanks
were
curved
inward
so
that
in
walking
their
ends
clashed
he
pointed
this
out
to
baird
who
was
amazed
at
the
discovery
well
well
that
s
so
they
re
bound
to
interfere
i
never
knew
that
about
hidalgo
spurs
we
might
straighten
them
suggested
the
actor
no
no
baird
insisted
i
wouldn
t
dare
try
that
they
cost
too
much
money
and
it
might
break
em
i
tell
you
what
you
do
stand
up
and
try
this
just
toe
in
a
little
when
you
walk
that
ll
bring
the
points
apart
there
that
s
it
that
s
the
cameras
were
again
recording
so
that
baird
could
later
make
his
study
of
the
difficulties
to
be
mastered
by
the
wearer
of
genuine
hidalgos
by
toeing
in
merton
now
succeeded
in
walking
without
disaster
though
he
could
not
feel
that
he
was
taking
the
free
stride
of
men
out
there
in
the
open
spaces
now
try
directed
baird
and
he
tried
running
but
again
the
spurs
caught
and
he
was
thrown
full
in
the
eyes
of
the
grinding
camera
he
had
forgotten
to
toe
in
but
he
would
not
give
up
his
face
was
set
in
buck
benson
grimness
each
time
he
picked
himself
up
and
earnestly
resumed
the
effort
the
rowels
were
now
catching
in
the
long
hair
of
his
chaps
he
worked
on
directed
and
cheered
by
the
patient
baird
while
the
two
camera
men
with
curiously
strained
faces
recorded
his
failures
baird
had
given
strict
orders
that
other
members
of
the
company
should
remain
at
a
distance
during
the
spur
lessons
but
now
he
seemed
to
believe
that
a
few
other
people
might
encourage
the
learner
merton
was
directed
to
run
to
his
old
mother
who
bucket
at
her
side
and
mop
in
hand
knelt
on
the
ground
at
a
little
distance
he
was
also
directed
to
run
toward
the
montague
girl
now
in
frontier
attire
of
fringed
buckskin
he
made
earnest
efforts
to
keep
his
feet
during
these
essays
but
the
spurs
still
proved
treacherous
just
pick
yourself
up
and
go
on
ordered
baird
and
had
the
cameras
secure
close
shots
of
merton
picking
himself
up
and
going
carefully
on
toeing
in
now
to
embrace
his
weeping
old
mother
and
the
breathless
girl
who
had
awaited
him
with
open
arms
he
was
tired
that
night
but
the
actual
contusions
he
had
suffered
in
his
falls
were
forgotten
in
the
fear
that
he
might
fail
to
master
the
hidalgos
baird
himself
seemed
confident
that
his
pupil
would
yet
excite
the
jealousy
of
buck
benson
in
this
hazardous
detail
of
the
screen
art
he
seemed
indeed
to
be
curiously
satisfied
with
his
afternoon
s
work
he
said
that
he
would
study
the
film
carefully
and
try
to
discover
just
how
the
spurs
could
be
mastered
you
ll
show
em
yet
how
to
take
a
joke
he
declared
when
the
puzzling
implements
were
at
last
doffed
the
young
actor
felt
repaid
for
his
earnest
efforts
no
one
could
put
on
a
pair
of
genuine
hidalgos
for
the
first
time
and
expect
to
handle
them
correctly
there
were
many
days
in
the
hills
until
this
time
the
simple
drama
had
been
fairly
coherent
in
merton
gill
s
mind
so
consecutively
were
the
scenes
shot
that
the
story
had
not
been
hard
to
follow
but
now
came
rather
a
jumble
of
scenes
not
only
at
times
bewildering
in
themselves
but
apparently
unrelated
first
it
appeared
that
the
montague
girl
as
miss
rebecca
hoffmeyer
had
tired
of
being
a
mere
new
york
society
butterfly
had
come
out
into
the
big
open
spaces
to
do
something
real
something
worth
while
the
ruin
of
her
father
still
unexplained
had
seemed
to
call
out
unsuspected
reserves
in
the
girl
she
was
stern
and
businesslike
in
such
scenes
as
merton
was
permitted
to
observe
and
she
had
not
only
brought
her
ruined
father
out
to
the
open
spaces
but
the
dissipated
brother
who
was
still
seen
to
play
at
dice
whenever
opportunity
offered
he
played
with
the
jolly
cowboys
and
invariably
won
off
in
the
hills
there
were
many
scenes
which
merton
did
not
overlook
i
want
you
to
have
just
your
own
part
in
mind
baird
told
him
and
although
he
was
puzzled
later
he
knew
that
baird
was
somehow
making
it
right
in
the
drama
when
he
became
again
the
successful
actor
of
that
first
scene
which
he
had
almost
forgotten
he
was
no
longer
the
buck
benson
of
the
open
spaces
but
the
foremost
idol
of
the
shadowed
stage
and
in
harold
parmalee
s
best
manner
he
informed
the
aspiring
montague
girl
that
he
could
not
accept
her
as
leading
lady
in
his
next
picture
because
she
lacked
experience
the
wager
of
a
kiss
was
laughingly
made
as
she
promised
that
within
ten
days
she
would
convince
him
of
her
talent
later
she
herself
in
an
effective
scene
became
the
grimfaced
buck
benson
and
held
the
actor
up
at
the
point
of
her
two
guns
then
when
she
had
convinced
him
that
she
was
benson
she
appeared
after
an
interval
as
her
own
father
the
fiery
beard
the
derby
hat
with
its
dents
the
chaps
the
bicycle
and
golf
bag
in
this
scene
she
seemed
to
demand
the
actor
s
intentions
toward
the
daughter
and
again
overwhelmed
him
with
confusion
as
parmalee
had
been
overwhelmed
when
she
revealed
her
true
self
under
the
baffling
disguise
the
wager
of
a
kiss
was
prettily
paid
this
much
of
the
drama
he
knew
and
there
was
an
affecting
final
scene
on
a
hillside
the
actor
arrayed
in
chaps
spurs
and
boots
below
the
waist
was
above
this
in
faultless
evening
dress
you
see
it
s
a
masquerade
party
at
the
ranche
baird
explained
and
you
ve
thought
up
this
costume
to
sort
of
puzzle
the
little
the
girl
herself
was
in
the
short
fringed
buckskin
skirt
with
knife
and
revolvers
in
her
belt
off
in
the
hills
day
after
day
she
had
worn
this
costume
in
those
active
scenes
he
had
not
witnessed
now
she
was
merely
coy
he
followed
her
out
on
the
hillside
with
only
a
little
trouble
from
the
spurs
indeed
he
fell
but
once
as
he
approached
her
and
the
little
drama
of
the
lovers
at
last
united
was
touchingly
shown
in
the
background
as
they
stood
entwined
the
poor
demented
old
mother
was
seen
with
mop
and
bucket
she
was
cleansing
the
side
of
a
cliff
but
there
was
a
happier
look
on
the
worn
old
face
glance
around
and
see
her
railed
baird
then
explain
to
the
girl
that
you
will
always
protect
your
mother
no
matter
what
happens
that
s
it
now
the
clench
kiss
her
slow
that
s
it
cut
merton
s
part
in
the
drama
was
ended
he
knew
that
the
company
worked
in
the
hills
another
week
and
there
were
more
to
take
in
the
but
he
was
not
needed
in
these
baird
congratulated
him
warmly
fine
work
my
boy
you
ve
done
your
first
picture
and
with
miss
montague
as
your
leading
lady
i
feel
that
you
re
going
to
land
with
your
public
now
all
you
got
to
do
for
a
couple
of
weeks
is
to
take
it
easy
while
we
finish
up
some
rough
ends
of
this
piece
then
we
ll
be
ready
to
start
on
the
new
one
it
s
pretty
well
doped
out
and
there
s
a
big
part
in
it
for
you
big
things
to
be
done
in
a
big
way
see
what
i
well
i
m
glad
i
suited
you
merton
replied
i
tried
to
give
the
best
that
was
in
me
to
a
sincere
interpretation
of
that
fine
part
and
it
was
a
great
surprise
to
me
i
never
thought
i
d
be
working
for
you
baird
and
of
course
i
wouldn
t
have
been
if
you
had
kept
on
doing
those
comedies
i
never
would
have
wanted
to
work
in
one
of
of
course
not
agreed
baird
cordially
i
realized
that
you
were
a
serious
artist
and
you
came
in
the
nick
of
time
just
when
i
was
wanting
to
be
serious
myself
to
get
away
from
that
stuff
into
something
better
and
finer
you
came
when
i
needed
you
and
look
here
merton
i
signed
you
on
at
forty
a
week
yes
sir
i
was
glad
to
get
well
i
m
going
to
give
you
more
from
the
beginning
of
the
new
picture
you
re
on
the
payroll
at
a
week
no
no
not
a
word
as
merton
would
have
thanked
him
you
re
earning
the
money
and
for
the
picture
after
that
well
if
you
keep
on
giving
the
best
that
s
in
you
it
will
be
a
whole
lot
more
now
take
a
good
rest
till
we
re
ready
for
at
last
he
had
won
suffering
and
sacrifice
had
told
and
baird
had
spoken
of
the
montague
girl
as
his
leading
lady
quite
as
if
he
were
a
star
and
dollars
a
week
a
sum
gashwiler
had
made
him
work
five
weeks
for
now
he
had
something
big
to
write
to
his
old
friend
tessie
kearns
she
might
spread
the
news
in
simsbury
he
thought
he
contrived
a
of
gashwiler
hearing
it
of
gashwiler
hearing
it
of
metta
judson
hearing
it
they
would
all
be
incredulous
until
a
certain
picture
was
shown
at
the
bijou
palace
a
gripping
drama
of
of
a
young
american
type
wrongfully
accused
of
a
crime
and
taking
the
burden
of
it
upon
his
own
shoulders
for
the
sake
of
the
girl
he
had
come
to
love
of
the
tense
play
of
elemental
forces
in
the
great
west
the
regeneration
of
a
shallow
society
girl
when
brought
to
adversity
by
the
ruin
of
her
old
father
of
the
lovers
reunited
in
that
west
they
both
loved
and
somehow
this
was
still
a
puzzle
the
very
effective
weaving
in
and
out
of
the
drama
of
the
world
s
most
popular
screen
idol
played
so
expertly
by
clifford
armytage
who
looked
enough
like
him
to
be
his
twin
brother
fresh
from
joyous
moments
in
the
projection
room
the
montague
girl
gazed
at
baird
across
the
latter
s
desk
baird
spoke
sis
he
s
a
jeff
you
re
a
wonder
how
d
you
ever
keep
him
from
getting
wise
baird
shrugged
easy
we
caught
him
how
d
you
ever
win
him
to
do
all
those
falls
on
the
trick
spurs
and
get
the
of
them
didn
t
he
know
you
were
shooting
oh
baird
shrugged
again
a
little
talk
made
that
all
jake
but
what
bothers
me
how
s
he
going
to
act
when
he
s
seen
the
picture
the
girl
became
grave
i
m
scared
stiff
every
time
i
think
of
it
maybe
he
ll
murder
you
maybe
he
ll
murder
both
of
us
you
got
him
into
she
did
not
smile
but
considered
gravely
absently
there
s
something
else
might
happen
she
said
at
last
that
boy
s
got
at
least
a
couple
of
sides
to
him
i
d
rather
he
d
be
crazy
mad
than
be
what
i
m
thinking
of
now
and
that
s
that
all
this
stuff
might
just
fairly
break
his
heart
think
of
it
to
see
his
fine
honest
acting
turned
into
good
old
buckeye
can
t
you
get
that
how
d
you
like
to
think
you
were
playing
romeo
and
act
your
heart
out
at
it
and
then
find
out
they
d
slipped
in
a
juliet
in
a
comedy
on
you
well
you
can
laugh
but
maybe
it
won
t
be
funny
to
him
honest
jeff
that
kid
gets
me
under
the
ribs
kind
of
i
hope
he
takes
it
standing
up
and
goes
good
and
crazy
i
ll
know
what
to
say
to
him
if
he
does
that
if
he
takes
it
the
other
way
lying
down
i
ll
be
too
ashamed
ever
to
look
him
in
the
eye
again
say
it
ll
be
like
going
up
to
a
friendly
baby
and
soaking
it
with
a
potato
masher
or
don
t
worry
about
it
kid
anyway
it
won
t
be
your
fault
so
much
as
mine
and
you
think
there
s
only
two
ways
for
him
to
take
it
mad
or
heart
broken
well
let
me
tell
you
something
about
that
lad
he
might
fool
you
both
ways
i
don
t
know
just
how
but
i
tell
you
he
s
an
actor
a
born
one
what
he
did
is
going
to
get
over
big
and
i
never
yet
saw
a
born
actor
that
would
take
applause
lying
down
even
if
it
does
come
for
what
he
didn
t
know
he
was
doing
maybe
he
ll
be
mad
that
s
natural
enough
but
maybe
he
ll
fool
us
both
so
cheerio
old
pippin
and
let
s
fly
into
the
new
piece
i
ll
play
safe
by
shooting
the
most
of
that
before
the
other
one
is
released
and
he
ll
still
be
playing
straight
in
a
serious
heart
drama
fancy
that
armand
chapter
xv
a
new
trail
one
genial
morning
a
few
days
later
the
sun
shone
in
across
the
desk
of
baird
while
he
talked
to
merton
gill
of
the
new
piece
it
was
a
sun
of
fairest
promise
gill
s
late
work
was
again
lavishly
commended
and
confidence
was
expressed
that
he
would
surpass
himself
in
the
drama
shortly
to
be
produced
baird
spoke
in
enthusiastic
terms
of
this
declaring
that
if
it
did
not
prove
to
be
a
a
picture
then
he
jeff
baird
could
safely
be
called
a
chinaman
and
during
the
time
that
would
elapse
before
shooting
on
the
new
piece
could
begin
he
specified
a
certain
study
in
which
he
wished
his
actor
to
engage
you
ve
watched
the
edgar
wayne
pictures
haven
t
you
yes
i
ve
seen
a
number
of
like
his
work
that
honest
stuff
wearing
overalls
and
tousled
hair
in
the
first
part
and
coming
out
in
city
clothes
and
eight
dollar
neckties
at
the
last
with
his
hair
slicked
back
same
as
a
seal
oh
yes
i
like
it
he
s
fine
he
has
a
great
good
that
s
the
kind
of
a
part
you
re
going
to
get
in
this
new
piece
lots
of
managers
in
my
place
would
say
s
a
capable
young
chap
and
has
plenty
of
talent
but
he
lacks
the
experience
to
play
an
edgar
wayne
that
s
what
a
lot
of
these
wisenheimers
would
say
but
me
not
so
i
believe
you
can
get
away
with
this
part
and
i
m
going
to
give
you
your
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
how
to
thank
you
baird
and
i
ll
try
to
give
you
the
very
best
that
is
in
me
i
m
sure
of
that
my
boy
you
needn
t
tell
me
but
now
what
i
want
you
to
do
while
you
got
this
between
pieces
chase
out
and
watch
all
the
edgar
wayne
pictures
you
can
find
there
was
one
up
on
the
boulevard
last
week
i
d
like
you
to
watch
times
it
may
be
at
another
house
down
this
way
or
it
may
be
out
in
one
of
the
suburbs
i
ll
have
someone
outside
call
up
and
find
where
it
is
and
they
ll
let
you
know
it
s
called
happy
homestead
or
something
snappy
like
that
and
it
kind
of
suggests
a
layout
for
this
new
piece
of
mine
see
what
i
mean
it
ll
suggest
things
to
you
edgar
and
his
mother
and
little
sister
live
on
this
farm
and
edgar
mixes
in
with
a
swell
dame
down
at
the
summer
hotel
and
a
villain
tries
to
get
his
old
mother
s
farm
and
another
villain
takes
his
little
sister
off
up
to
the
wicked
city
and
edgar
has
more
trouble
than
would
patch
hell
a
mile
see
but
it
all
comes
right
in
the
end
and
the
city
girl
falls
for
him
when
she
sees
him
in
his
clothes
it
s
a
pretty
little
thing
but
to
my
way
of
thinking
it
lacks
strength
not
enough
punch
to
it
so
we
re
sort
of
building
up
on
that
general
idea
only
we
ll
put
in
the
pep
that
this
piece
lacked
if
i
don
t
miss
my
guess
you
ll
be
able
to
show
wayne
a
few
things
about
serious
acting
especially
after
you
ve
studied
his
methods
a
little
bit
in
this
well
if
you
think
i
can
do
it
began
merton
then
broke
off
in
answer
to
a
sudden
thought
will
my
mother
be
the
same
actress
that
played
it
before
the
one
that
mopped
all
the
time
yes
the
same
actress
but
a
different
sort
of
mother
she
she
s
more
enterprising
she
s
a
sort
of
chemist
in
a
way
puts
up
preserves
and
jellies
for
the
hotel
she
never
touches
a
mop
in
the
whole
piece
and
dresses
neat
from
start
to
and
does
the
man
play
in
it
sometimes
in
scenes
with
him
i
d
get
the
idea
i
wasn
t
really
doing
my
yes
yes
i
baird
waved
a
sympathetic
hand
poor
old
jack
he
s
trying
hard
to
do
something
worth
while
but
he
s
played
in
those
cheap
comedy
things
so
long
it
s
sort
of
hard
for
him
to
get
out
of
it
and
play
serious
stuff
if
you
know
what
i
i
know
what
you
mean
said
merton
and
he
s
been
with
me
so
long
i
kind
of
hate
to
discharge
him
you
see
on
account
of
those
eyes
of
his
it
would
be
hard
for
him
to
get
a
job
as
a
serious
actor
so
i
did
think
i
d
give
him
another
part
in
this
piece
if
you
didn
t
object
just
to
sort
of
work
him
into
the
things
he
s
so
eager
for
the
chance
it
was
quite
pathetic
how
grateful
he
looked
when
i
told
him
i
d
try
him
once
more
in
one
of
the
better
and
finer
things
and
a
promise
is
a
still
merton
you
re
the
man
i
must
suit
in
this
cast
if
you
say
the
word
i
ll
tell
jack
he
must
go
though
i
know
what
a
blow
it
will
be
to
him
oh
no
baird
merton
interrupted
fervently
i
wouldn
t
think
of
such
a
thing
let
the
poor
fellow
have
a
chance
to
learn
something
better
than
the
buffoonery
he
s
been
doing
i
ll
do
everything
i
can
to
help
him
i
think
it
is
very
pathetic
his
wanting
to
do
the
better
things
it
s
fine
of
him
and
maybe
some
day
he
could
save
up
enough
to
have
a
good
surgeon
fix
his
eyes
right
it
might
be
done
you
now
that
s
nice
of
you
my
boy
it
s
kind
and
generous
not
every
actor
of
your
talent
would
want
jack
working
in
the
same
scene
with
him
and
perhaps
as
you
say
some
day
he
can
save
up
enough
from
his
wages
to
have
his
eyes
fixed
i
ll
mention
it
to
him
and
this
reminds
me
speaking
of
the
cast
there
s
another
member
who
might
bother
some
of
these
fussy
actors
she
s
the
girl
who
will
take
the
part
of
your
city
sweetheart
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
isn
t
exactly
the
type
i
d
have
picked
for
the
part
because
she
s
rather
a
large
hearty
girl
if
you
know
what
i
mean
i
could
have
found
a
lot
who
were
better
lookers
but
the
poor
thing
has
a
bedridden
father
and
mother
and
a
little
crippled
brother
and
a
little
sister
that
isn
t
well
and
she
s
working
hard
to
send
them
all
to
school
i
mean
the
children
not
her
parents
so
i
saw
the
chance
to
do
her
a
good
turn
and
i
hope
you
ll
feel
that
you
can
work
harmoniously
with
her
i
know
i
m
too
darned
human
to
be
in
this
business
baird
looked
aside
to
conceal
his
emotion
i
m
sure
baird
i
ll
get
along
fine
with
the
young
lady
and
i
think
it
s
fine
of
you
to
give
these
people
jobs
when
you
could
get
better
folks
in
their
well
well
we
ll
say
no
more
about
that
replied
baird
gruffly
as
one
who
had
again
hidden
his
heart
now
ask
in
the
outer
office
where
that
wayne
film
is
and
catch
it
as
often
as
you
feel
you
re
getting
any
of
the
edgar
wayne
stuff
we
ll
call
you
up
when
work
he
saw
the
edgar
wayne
film
a
touching
story
in
which
the
timid
diffident
country
boy
triumphed
over
difficulties
and
won
the
love
of
a
pure
new
york
society
girl
meantime
protecting
his
mother
from
the
insulting
sneers
of
the
idle
rich
and
being
made
to
suffer
intensely
by
the
apparent
moral
wreck
of
his
dear
little
sister
whom
a
rich
scoundrel
lured
to
the
great
city
with
false
promises
that
he
would
make
a
fine
lady
of
her
never
before
had
he
studied
the
acting
method
of
wayne
with
a
definite
aim
in
view
now
he
watched
until
he
himself
became
the
awkward
country
boy
he
was
primed
with
the
wayne
manner
the
appealing
ingenuousness
the
simple
embarrassments
the
manly
regard
for
the
old
mother
when
word
came
that
baird
was
ready
for
him
in
the
new
piece
this
drama
was
strikingly
like
the
wayne
piece
he
had
watched
at
least
in
its
beginning
baird
in
his
striving
for
the
better
things
seemed
at
first
to
have
copied
his
model
almost
too
faithfully
not
only
was
merton
to
be
the
awkward
country
boy
in
the
little
hillside
farmhouse
but
his
mother
and
sister
were
like
the
other
mother
and
sister
still
he
began
to
observe
differences
the
little
sister
played
by
the
montague
girl
was
a
simple
farm
maiden
as
in
the
other
piece
but
the
mother
was
more
energetic
she
had
silvery
hair
and
wore
a
neat
black
dress
with
a
white
lace
collar
and
a
cameo
brooch
at
her
neck
and
she
embraced
her
son
tearfully
at
frequent
intervals
as
had
the
other
mother
but
she
carried
on
in
her
kitchen
an
active
business
in
canning
fruits
and
putting
up
jellies
which
sold
to
the
rich
people
at
the
hotel
would
swell
the
little
fund
that
must
be
saved
to
pay
the
mortgage
also
in
the
present
piece
the
country
boy
was
to
become
a
great
inventor
and
this
was
different
merton
felt
that
this
was
a
good
touch
it
gave
him
dignity
he
appeared
ready
for
work
on
the
morning
designated
he
was
now
able
to
make
up
himself
and
he
dressed
in
the
costume
that
had
been
provided
it
was
perhaps
not
so
attractive
a
costume
as
edgar
wayne
had
worn
consisting
of
overalls
that
came
well
above
his
waist
and
were
fastened
by
straps
that
went
over
the
shoulders
but
as
baird
remarked
the
contrast
would
be
greater
when
he
dressed
in
rich
city
clothes
at
the
last
his
hair
too
was
no
longer
the
hair
of
parmalee
but
tousled
in
country
disorder
for
much
of
the
action
of
the
new
piece
they
would
require
an
outside
location
but
there
were
some
interiors
to
be
shot
on
the
lot
he
forgot
the
overalls
when
shown
his
attic
laboratory
where
as
an
ambitious
young
inventor
sustained
by
the
unfaltering
trust
of
mother
and
sister
he
would
perfect
certain
mechanical
devices
that
would
bring
him
fame
fortune
and
the
love
of
a
pure
new
york
society
girl
it
was
a
humble
little
room
containing
a
that
held
his
tools
and
a
table
littered
with
drawings
over
which
he
bent
until
late
hours
of
the
night
at
this
table
simple
unaffected
deeply
earnest
he
was
shown
as
the
dreaming
young
inventor
perplexed
at
moments
then
with
brightening
eyes
making
some
needful
change
in
the
drawings
he
felt
in
these
scenes
that
he
was
revealing
a
world
of
personality
and
he
must
struggle
to
give
a
sincere
interpretation
in
later
scenes
that
would
require
more
action
he
would
show
baird
that
he
had
not
watched
edgar
wayne
without
profit
another
interior
was
of
the
neat
living
room
of
the
humble
home
here
were
scenes
of
happy
family
life
with
the
little
sister
and
the
fond
old
mother
the
montague
girl
was
a
charming
picture
in
her
simple
print
dress
and
sunbonnet
beneath
which
hung
her
braid
of
golden
hair
the
mother
was
a
sweet
old
dear
dressed
as
baird
had
promised
she
early
confided
to
merton
that
she
was
glad
her
part
was
not
to
be
a
mopping
part
in
that
case
she
would
have
had
to
wear
whereas
now
she
was
merely
she
said
to
be
a
tired
business
woman
still
another
interior
was
of
her
kitchen
where
she
busily
carried
on
her
activities
pots
boiled
on
the
stove
and
glass
jars
were
filled
with
her
product
one
of
the
pots
merton
noticed
the
largest
had
a
tightly
closed
top
from
which
a
slender
tube
of
copper
went
across
one
corner
of
the
little
room
to
where
it
coiled
in
a
bucket
filled
with
water
whence
it
discharged
its
contents
into
bottles
this
it
seemed
was
his
mother
s
improved
grape
juice
a
cooling
drink
to
tempt
the
jaded
palates
of
the
city
folks
up
at
the
big
hotel
the
laboratory
of
the
young
inventor
was
abundantly
filmed
while
the
earnest
country
boy
dreamed
hopefully
above
his
drawings
or
tinkered
at
metal
devices
on
the
the
kitchen
in
which
his
mother
toiled
was
repeatedly
shot
including
of
the
old
mother
s
ingenious
contrivances
especially
of
the
closed
boiler
with
its
coil
of
copper
tubing
by
which
she
was
helping
to
save
the
humble
home
and
a
scene
in
the
neat
living
room
with
its
furniture
made
it
all
too
clear
that
every
effort
would
be
required
to
save
the
little
home
the
cruel
a
lawyer
with
whiskers
confronted
the
three
shrinking
inmates
to
warn
them
that
he
must
have
his
money
by
a
certain
day
or
out
they
would
go
into
the
streets
the
old
mother
wept
at
this
and
the
earnest
boy
took
her
in
his
arms
the
little
sister
terrified
by
the
man
s
rough
words
also
flew
to
this
shelter
and
thus
he
defied
the
intruder
calm
fearless
dignified
the
money
would
be
paid
and
the
intruder
would
now
please
remember
that
until
the
day
named
this
little
home
was
their
very
own
the
scoundrel
left
with
a
final
menacing
wave
of
his
gnarled
hand
left
the
group
facing
ruin
unless
the
invention
could
be
perfected
unless
mother
could
sell
an
extraordinary
quantity
of
fruit
or
improved
grape
juice
to
the
city
folks
or
indeed
unless
the
little
sister
could
do
something
wonderful
she
it
now
seemed
was
confident
she
also
could
help
she
stood
apart
from
them
and
prettily
promised
to
do
something
wonderful
she
asked
them
to
remember
that
she
was
no
longer
a
mere
girl
but
a
woman
with
a
woman
s
determination
they
both
patted
the
little
thing
encouragingly
on
the
back
the
interiors
possible
on
the
holden
lot
having
been
finished
they
motored
each
day
to
a
remote
edge
of
the
city
where
outside
locations
had
been
found
for
the
humble
farmhouse
and
the
grand
hotel
the
farmhouse
was
excellently
chosen
merton
thought
being
the
neat
unpretentious
abode
of
honest
people
but
the
hotel
some
distance
off
was
not
so
grand
he
thought
as
baird
s
new
play
seemed
to
demand
it
was
plainly
a
hotel
a
wooden
structure
with
balconies
but
it
seemed
hardly
to
afford
those
attractions
that
would
draw
wealthier
element
from
new
york
he
forebore
to
warn
baird
of
this
however
fearing
to
discourage
a
manager
who
was
honestly
striving
for
the
serious
in
photodrama
his
first
exterior
scene
saw
him
with
the
help
of
mother
and
little
sister
loading
the
one
poor
motor
car
which
the
family
possessed
with
mother
s
products
these
were
then
driven
to
the
hotel
the
montague
girl
drove
the
car
and
scenes
of
it
in
motion
were
shot
from
a
car
that
preceded
them
they
arrived
before
the
hotel
merton
was
directed
to
take
from
the
car
an
iron
weight
attached
to
a
rope
and
running
to
a
connection
forward
on
the
hood
he
was
to
throw
the
weight
to
the
ground
plainly
with
the
notion
that
he
would
thus
prevent
the
car
from
running
away
the
simple
device
was
in
fact
similar
to
that
used
at
gashwiler
s
strict
orders
on
the
delivery
wagon
back
in
simsbury
for
gashwiler
had
believed
that
dexter
would
run
away
if
untethered
but
of
course
it
was
absurd
merton
saw
to
anchor
a
motor
car
in
such
a
manner
and
he
was
somewhat
taken
aback
when
baird
directed
this
action
it
s
all
right
baird
assured
him
you
re
a
simple
country
boy
and
don
t
know
any
better
so
do
it
plumb
serious
you
ll
be
smart
enough
before
the
show
s
over
go
ahead
get
out
grab
the
weight
throw
it
down
and
don
t
look
at
it
again
as
if
you
did
this
every
time
that
s
it
you
re
not
being
funny
just
a
simple
country
boy
like
wayne
was
at
he
performed
the
action
still
with
some
slight
misgiving
followed
scenes
of
brother
and
sister
offering
mother
s
wares
to
the
city
folks
idling
on
the
porch
of
the
hotel
each
bearing
a
basket
they
were
caught
submitting
the
jellies
and
jams
the
brother
was
laughed
at
even
sneered
at
by
the
supercilious
rich
the
handsomely
gowned
women
and
the
dissipated
looking
men
no
one
appeared
to
wish
his
jellies
the
little
sister
had
better
luck
the
women
turned
from
her
but
the
men
gathered
about
her
and
quickly
bought
out
the
stock
she
went
to
the
car
for
more
and
the
men
followed
her
to
merton
who
watched
these
scenes
the
dramatist
s
intention
was
plain
these
men
did
not
really
care
for
jellies
and
jams
they
were
attracted
solely
by
the
beauty
of
the
little
country
girl
and
they
were
plainly
the
sort
of
men
whose
attentions
could
mean
no
good
to
such
as
she
left
on
the
porch
he
was
now
directed
to
approach
a
distinguished
looking
old
gentleman
probably
a
banker
and
a
power
in
wall
street
who
read
his
morning
papers
timidly
he
stood
before
this
person
thrusting
forward
his
basket
the
old
gentleman
glanced
up
in
annoyance
and
brutally
rebuffed
the
country
boy
with
an
angry
flourish
of
the
paper
he
read
you
re
hurt
by
this
treatment
called
baird
and
almost
discouraged
you
look
back
over
your
shoulder
to
where
sister
is
doing
a
good
business
with
her
stuff
and
you
see
the
old
mother
back
in
her
kitchen
working
her
fingers
to
the
bone
we
ll
have
a
flash
of
that
see
and
you
try
again
take
out
that
bottle
in
the
corner
of
the
basket
uncork
it
and
try
again
the
old
man
looks
s
smelled
something
you
hold
the
bottle
toward
him
and
you
re
saying
oh
mister
if
you
knew
how
hard
my
poor
old
mother
works
to
make
this
stuff
won
t
you
please
take
a
little
taste
of
her
improved
grape
juice
and
see
if
you
don
t
want
to
buy
a
few
shillings
worth
see
what
i
mean
that
s
it
look
pleading
think
how
the
little
home
depends
on
the
old
gentleman
first
so
rude
consented
to
taste
the
improved
grape
juice
he
put
the
bottle
to
his
lips
and
tilted
it
a
camera
was
brought
up
to
record
closely
the
look
of
pleased
astonishment
that
enlivened
his
face
he
arose
to
his
feet
tilted
the
bottle
again
this
time
drinking
abundantly
he
smacked
his
lips
with
relish
glanced
furtively
at
the
group
of
women
in
the
background
caught
the
country
boy
by
a
sleeve
and
drew
him
farther
along
the
porch
he
s
telling
you
what
fine
stuff
this
grape
juice
is
explained
baird
saying
that
your
mother
must
be
a
wonderful
old
lady
and
he
ll
drop
over
to
meet
her
and
in
the
meantime
he
wants
you
to
bring
him
all
this
grape
juice
she
has
he
ll
take
it
she
can
name
her
own
price
he
hands
you
a
ten
dollar
bill
for
the
bottle
he
has
and
for
another
in
the
basket
that
s
it
give
it
to
him
the
rest
of
the
bottles
are
jams
or
something
you
want
him
to
take
them
but
he
pushes
them
back
he
s
saying
he
wants
the
improved
grape
juice
or
nothing
he
shows
a
big
wad
of
bills
to
show
he
can
pay
for
it
you
look
glad
now
the
little
home
may
be
saved
after
the
scene
was
shot
merton
felt
that
he
carried
it
acceptably
he
had
shown
the
diffident
pleading
of
the
country
boy
that
his
mother
s
product
should
be
at
least
tasted
his
frank
rejoicing
when
the
old
gentleman
approved
of
it
he
was
not
so
well
satisfied
with
the
work
of
the
montague
girl
as
his
innocent
little
sister
in
her
sale
of
mother
s
jellies
to
the
city
men
in
her
acceptance
of
their
attentions
she
appeared
to
be
just
the
least
bit
bold
it
seemed
almost
as
if
she
wished
to
attract
their
notice
he
hesitated
to
admit
it
for
he
profoundly
esteemed
the
girl
but
there
were
even
moments
when
in
technical
language
she
actually
seemed
to
vamp
these
creatures
who
thronged
about
her
to
profess
for
her
jams
and
jellies
an
interest
he
was
sure
they
did
not
feel
he
wondered
if
baird
had
made
it
plain
to
her
that
she
was
a
very
innocent
little
country
girl
who
should
be
unpleasantly
affected
by
these
advances
the
scene
he
watched
shot
where
the
little
sister
climbed
back
into
the
motor
car
leered
at
by
the
four
new
york
he
thought
especially
distasteful
surely
the
skirt
of
her
print
dress
was
already
short
enough
she
needed
not
to
lift
it
under
this
evil
regard
as
she
put
her
foot
up
to
the
step
it
was
on
the
porch
of
the
hotel
too
that
he
was
to
have
his
first
scene
with
the
new
york
society
girl
whose
hand
he
won
she
proved
to
be
the
daughter
of
the
old
gentleman
who
liked
the
improved
grape
juice
as
baird
had
intimated
she
was
a
large
girl
not
only
tall
and
stoutly
built
but
somewhat
heavy
of
face
baird
s
heart
must
have
been
touched
indeed
when
he
consented
to
employ
her
but
merton
remembered
her
bedridden
father
and
mother
the
little
crippled
brother
the
little
sister
who
was
also
in
poor
health
and
resolved
to
make
their
scenes
together
as
easy
for
her
as
he
could
at
their
first
encounter
she
appeared
in
a
mannish
coat
and
riding
breeches
though
she
looked
every
inch
a
woman
in
this
attire
she
sees
you
and
it
s
a
case
of
love
at
first
sight
on
her
part
explained
baird
and
you
love
her
too
only
you
re
a
bashful
country
boy
and
can
t
show
it
the
way
she
can
try
out
a
little
first
scene
merton
stood
his
basket
on
his
arm
as
the
girl
approached
him
look
down
called
baird
and
merton
lowered
his
gaze
under
the
ardent
regard
of
the
social
butterfly
she
tossed
away
her
cigarette
and
came
nearer
then
she
mischievously
pinched
his
cheek
as
the
new
york
men
had
pinched
his
little
sister
s
having
done
this
she
placed
her
hand
beneath
his
chin
and
raised
his
face
to
hers
now
look
up
at
her
called
baird
but
she
frightens
you
remember
your
country
raising
you
never
saw
a
society
girl
before
that
s
it
look
frightened
while
she
s
admiring
you
in
that
bold
way
now
turn
a
little
and
look
down
again
pinch
his
cheek
once
more
lulu
now
merton
look
up
and
smile
but
kind
of
scared
you
re
still
afraid
of
her
and
offer
her
a
bottle
of
ma
s
preserves
step
back
a
little
as
you
do
it
because
you
re
kind
of
afraid
of
what
she
might
do
next
that
s
fine
good
work
both
of
he
was
glad
for
the
girl
s
sake
that
baird
had
approved
the
work
of
both
he
had
been
afraid
she
was
overdoing
the
new
york
society
manner
in
the
boldness
of
her
advances
to
him
but
of
course
baird
would
know
his
conscience
hurt
him
a
little
when
the
montague
girl
added
her
praise
to
baird
s
for
his
own
work
kid
you
certainly
stepped
neat
and
looked
nice
in
that
love
scene
she
warmly
told
him
he
would
have
liked
to
praise
her
own
work
but
could
not
bring
himself
to
perhaps
she
would
grow
more
shrinking
and
modest
as
the
drama
progressed
a
part
of
the
play
now
developed
as
he
had
foreseen
it
would
in
that
the
city
men
at
the
hotel
pursued
the
little
sister
to
her
own
with
attentions
that
she
should
have
found
unwelcome
but
even
now
she
behaved
in
a
way
he
could
not
approve
she
seemed
determined
to
meet
the
city
men
halfway
i
m
to
be
the
sunlight
arc
of
this
hovel
she
announced
when
the
city
men
came
one
at
a
time
to
shower
gifts
upon
the
little
wild
rose
later
it
became
apparent
that
she
must
in
the
end
pay
dearly
for
her
acceptance
of
these
favours
one
after
another
the
four
city
men
whose
very
appearance
would
have
been
sufficient
warning
to
most
girls
endeavoured
to
lure
her
up
to
the
great
city
where
they
promised
to
make
a
lady
of
her
it
was
a
situation
notoriously
involving
danger
to
the
simple
country
girl
yet
not
even
her
mother
frowned
upon
it
the
mother
indeed
frankly
urged
the
child
to
let
all
of
these
kind
gentlemen
make
a
lady
of
her
the
brother
should
have
warned
her
in
this
extremity
but
the
brother
was
not
permitted
any
share
in
these
scenes
only
merton
gill
in
his
proper
person
seemed
to
feel
the
little
girl
was
all
too
cordially
inviting
trouble
he
became
confused
ultimately
by
reason
of
the
scenes
not
being
taken
consecutively
it
appeared
that
the
little
sister
actually
left
her
humble
home
at
the
insistence
of
one
of
the
villains
yet
she
did
not
apparently
creep
back
months
later
broken
in
body
and
soul
as
nearly
as
he
could
gather
she
was
back
the
next
day
and
it
almost
seemed
as
if
later
at
brief
intervals
she
allowed
herself
to
start
for
the
great
city
with
each
of
the
other
three
scoundrels
who
were
bent
upon
her
destruction
but
always
she
appeared
to
return
safely
and
to
bring
large
sums
of
money
with
which
to
delight
the
old
mother
it
was
puzzling
to
merton
he
decided
at
last
he
did
not
like
to
ask
the
montague
girl
that
baird
had
tried
the
same
scene
four
times
and
would
choose
the
best
of
these
for
his
drama
brother
and
sister
made
further
trips
to
the
hotel
with
their
offerings
only
the
sister
now
took
jams
and
jellies
exclusively
which
she
sold
to
the
male
guests
while
the
brother
took
only
the
improved
grape
juice
which
the
rich
old
new
yorker
bought
and
generously
paid
for
there
were
other
scenes
at
the
hotel
between
the
country
boy
and
the
new
york
society
girl
in
which
the
latter
was
an
ardent
wooer
once
she
was
made
to
snatch
a
kiss
from
him
as
he
stood
by
her
his
basket
on
his
arm
he
struggled
in
her
embrace
then
turned
to
flee
she
was
shown
looking
after
him
laughing
carelessly
slapping
one
leg
with
her
riding
crop
you
re
still
timid
baird
told
him
you
can
hardly
believe
you
have
won
her
in
some
following
scenes
at
the
little
farmhouse
it
became
impossible
for
him
longer
to
doubt
this
for
the
girl
frankly
told
her
love
as
she
lingered
with
him
at
the
gate
she
s
one
of
these
new
women
said
baird
she
s
living
her
own
life
you
listen
it
s
wonderful
that
this
great
love
should
have
come
to
you
let
us
see
the
great
joy
dawning
in
your
he
endeavoured
to
show
this
the
new
york
girl
became
more
ardent
she
put
an
arm
about
him
drew
him
to
her
slowly
almost
in
the
manner
of
harold
parmalee
as
it
seemed
to
him
she
bent
down
and
imprinted
a
long
kiss
upon
his
lips
he
had
been
somewhat
difficult
to
rehearse
in
this
scene
but
baird
made
it
all
plain
he
was
still
the
bashful
country
boy
though
now
he
would
be
awakened
by
love
the
girl
drew
him
from
the
gate
to
her
waiting
automobile
here
she
overcame
a
last
reluctance
and
induced
him
to
enter
she
followed
and
drove
rapidly
off
it
was
only
now
that
baird
let
him
into
the
very
heart
of
the
drama
you
see
he
told
merton
you
ve
watched
these
city
folks
you
ve
wanted
city
life
and
fine
clothes
for
yourself
so
in
a
moment
of
weakness
you
ve
gone
up
to
town
with
this
girl
to
have
a
look
at
the
place
and
it
sort
of
took
hold
of
you
in
fact
you
hit
up
quite
a
pace
for
awhile
but
at
last
you
go
stale
on
it
the
blight
of
broadway
suggested
merton
wondering
if
there
could
be
a
cabaret
scene
exactly
said
baird
and
you
get
to
thinking
of
the
poor
old
mother
and
little
sister
back
here
at
home
working
away
to
pay
off
the
mortgage
and
you
decide
to
come
back
you
get
back
on
a
stormy
night
lots
of
snow
and
wind
you
re
pretty
weak
we
ll
show
you
sort
of
fainting
as
you
reach
the
door
you
have
no
overcoat
nor
hat
and
your
city
suit
is
practically
ruined
you
got
a
great
chance
for
some
good
acting
here
especially
after
you
get
inside
to
face
the
folks
it
ll
be
the
strongest
thing
you
ve
done
so
it
was
indeed
an
opportunity
for
strong
acting
he
could
see
that
he
stayed
late
with
baird
and
his
staff
one
night
and
a
scene
of
the
prodigal
s
return
to
the
door
of
the
little
home
was
shot
in
a
blinding
baird
warmly
congratulated
the
mechanics
who
contrived
the
storm
and
was
enthusiastic
over
the
acting
of
the
hero
through
the
wintry
blast
he
staggered
half
falling
to
reach
the
door
where
he
collapsed
the
light
caught
the
agony
on
his
pale
face
he
lay
a
moment
then
reached
up
a
feeble
hand
to
the
knob
of
the
door
it
was
one
of
the
annoyances
incident
to
screen
art
that
he
could
not
go
in
at
that
moment
to
finish
his
great
scene
but
this
must
be
done
back
on
the
lot
and
the
scene
could
not
be
secured
until
the
next
day
once
more
he
became
the
pitiful
victim
of
a
great
city
crawling
back
to
the
home
shelter
on
a
wintry
night
it
was
christmas
eve
he
now
learned
he
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
little
home
and
staggered
in
to
face
his
old
mother
and
the
little
sister
they
sprang
forward
at
his
entrance
the
sister
ran
to
support
him
to
the
homely
old
sofa
he
was
weak
emaciated
his
face
an
agony
of
repentance
as
he
mutely
pled
forgiveness
for
his
flight
his
old
mother
had
risen
had
seemed
about
to
embrace
him
fondly
when
he
knelt
at
her
feet
but
then
had
drawn
herself
sternly
up
and
pointed
commandingly
to
the
door
the
prodigal
anguished
anew
at
this
repulse
fell
weakly
back
upon
the
couch
with
a
cry
of
despair
the
little
sister
placed
a
pillow
under
his
head
and
ran
to
plead
with
the
mother
a
long
time
she
remained
obdurate
but
at
last
relented
then
she
too
came
to
fall
upon
her
knees
before
the
wreck
who
had
returned
to
her
not
many
rehearsals
were
required
for
this
scene
difficult
though
it
was
merton
gill
had
seized
his
opportunity
his
study
of
agony
expressions
in
the
film
course
was
here
rewarded
the
scene
closed
with
the
departure
of
the
little
sister
resolutely
showing
the
light
of
some
fierce
determination
she
put
on
hat
and
wraps
spoke
words
of
promise
to
the
stricken
mother
and
son
and
darted
out
into
the
night
the
snow
whirled
in
as
she
opened
the
door
good
work
said
baird
to
merton
if
you
don
t
hear
from
that
little
bit
you
can
call
me
a
some
later
scenes
were
shot
in
the
same
little
home
which
seemed
to
bring
the
drama
to
a
close
while
the
returned
prodigal
lay
on
the
couch
nursed
by
the
forgiving
mother
the
sister
returned
in
company
with
the
new
york
society
girl
who
seemed
aghast
at
the
wreck
of
him
she
had
once
wooed
slowly
she
approached
the
couch
of
the
sufferer
tenderly
she
reached
down
to
enfold
him
in
some
manner
which
merton
could
not
divine
the
lovers
had
been
reunited
the
new
york
girl
was
followed
by
her
father
it
would
seem
they
had
both
come
from
the
hotel
and
the
father
after
giving
an
order
for
more
of
mother
s
grape
juice
examined
the
son
s
patents
two
of
them
he
exclaimed
with
delight
over
and
at
once
paid
the
boy
a
huge
roll
of
bills
for
a
tenth
interest
in
them
now
came
the
grasping
man
who
held
the
mortgage
and
who
had
counted
upon
driving
the
family
into
the
streets
this
stormy
christmas
eve
he
was
overwhelmed
with
confusion
when
his
money
was
paid
from
an
ample
hoard
and
slunk
out
into
the
night
it
could
be
seen
that
christmas
day
would
dawn
bright
and
happy
for
the
little
group
to
merton
s
eye
there
was
but
one
discord
in
this
finale
he
had
known
that
the
man
was
playing
the
part
of
hotel
clerk
at
the
neighbouring
resort
but
he
had
watched
few
scenes
in
which
the
poor
fellow
acted
and
he
surely
had
not
known
that
this
man
was
the
little
sister
s
future
husband
it
was
with
real
dismay
that
he
averted
his
gaze
from
the
embrace
that
occurred
between
these
two
as
the
clerk
entered
the
now
happy
home
one
other
detail
had
puzzled
him
this
was
the
bundle
to
which
he
had
clung
as
he
blindly
plunged
through
the
storm
he
had
still
fiercely
clutched
it
after
entering
the
little
room
clasping
it
to
his
breast
even
as
he
sank
at
his
mother
s
feet
in
physical
exhaustion
and
mental
anguish
to
implore
her
forgiveness
later
the
bundle
was
placed
beside
him
as
he
lay
pale
and
wan
on
the
couch
he
supposed
this
bundle
to
contain
one
of
his
patents
a
question
to
baird
when
the
scene
was
over
proved
him
to
be
correct
sure
said
baird
that
s
one
of
your
yet
he
still
wished
the
little
sister
had
not
been
made
to
marry
the
hotel
clerk
and
another
detail
lingered
in
his
memory
to
bother
him
the
actress
playing
his
mother
was
wont
to
smoke
cigarettes
when
not
engaged
in
acting
he
had
long
known
it
but
he
now
seemed
to
recall
in
that
touching
last
scene
of
reconciliation
that
she
had
smoked
one
while
the
camera
actually
turned
he
hoped
this
was
not
so
it
would
mean
a
mistake
and
baird
would
be
justly
annoyed
by
the
old
mother
s
carelessness
chapter

of
sarah
nevada
montague
they
were
six
long
weeks
doing
the
new
piece
the
weeks
seemed
long
to
merton
gill
because
there
were
so
many
hours
even
days
of
enforced
idleness
to
pass
an
entire
day
his
face
stiff
with
the
without
once
confronting
a
camera
in
action
seemed
to
him
a
waste
of
his
own
time
and
a
waste
of
baird
s
money
yet
this
appeared
to
be
one
of
the
unavoidable
penalties
incurred
by
those
who
engaged
in
the
art
of
photodrama
time
was
needed
to
create
that
world
of
painted
shadows
so
swift
so
nicely
consecutive
when
revealed
but
so
incoherent
so
brokenly
inconsequent
so
meaningless
in
the
recording
how
little
an
audience
could
suspect
the
vexatious
delays
ensuing
between
say
a
knock
at
a
door
and
the
admission
of
a
visitor
to
a
neat
little
home
where
a
fond
old
mother
was
trying
to
pay
off
a
mortgage
with
the
help
of
her
little
ones
how
could
an
audience
divine
that
a
wait
of
two
hours
had
been
caused
because
a
polished
city
villain
had
forgotten
his
spats
or
that
other
long
waits
had
been
caused
by
other
forgotten
trifles
while
an
expensive
company
of
artists
lounged
about
in
bored
apathy
or
smoked
gossiped
bantered
yet
no
one
ever
seemed
to
express
concern
about
these
waits
rarely
were
their
causes
known
except
by
some
frenzied
assistant
director
and
he
after
a
little
would
cease
to
be
frenzied
and
fall
to
loafing
calmly
with
the
others
merton
gill
s
education
in
his
chosen
art
was
progressing
he
came
to
loaf
with
the
unconcern
the
vacuous
boredom
the
practised
nonchalance
of
more
seasoned
artists
sometimes
when
exteriors
were
being
taken
the
sky
would
overcloud
and
the
sun
be
denied
them
for
a
whole
day
the
montague
girl
would
then
ask
merton
how
he
liked
sunny
cafeteria
he
knew
this
was
a
jesting
term
that
would
stand
for
sunny
california
and
never
failed
to
laugh
the
girl
kept
rather
closely
by
him
during
these
periods
of
waiting
she
seemed
to
show
little
interest
in
other
members
of
the
company
and
her
association
with
them
merton
noted
was
marked
by
a
certain
restraint
with
them
she
seemed
no
longer
to
be
the
girl
of
free
ways
and
speech
she
might
occasionally
join
a
group
of
the
men
who
indulged
in
athletic
sports
on
the
grass
before
the
little
farmhouse
for
the
actors
of
baird
s
company
would
all
betray
acrobatic
tendencies
in
their
idle
moments
and
he
watched
one
day
while
the
simple
little
country
sister
turned
a
series
of
and
that
evoked
sincere
applause
from
the
four
new
york
villains
who
had
been
thus
solacing
their
ennui
but
oftener
she
would
sit
with
merton
on
the
back
seat
of
one
of
the
waiting
automobiles
she
not
only
kept
herself
rather
aloof
from
other
members
of
the
company
but
she
curiously
seemed
to
bring
it
about
that
merton
himself
would
have
little
contact
with
them
especially
did
she
seem
to
hover
between
him
and
the
company
s
feminine
members
among
those
impersonating
guests
at
the
hotel
were
several
young
women
of
rare
beauty
with
whom
he
would
have
been
not
unwilling
to
fraternize
in
that
easy
comradeship
which
seemed
to
mark
studio
life
these
were
far
more
alluring
than
the
new
york
society
girl
who
wooed
him
and
who
had
secured
the
part
solely
through
baird
s
sympathy
for
her
family
misfortunes
they
were
richly
arrayed
and
charmingly
mannered
in
the
scenes
he
watched
moreover
they
not
too
subtly
betrayed
a
pleasant
consciousness
of
merton
s
existence
but
the
montague
girl
noticeably
monopolized
him
when
a
better
acquaintance
with
the
beauties
might
have
come
about
she
rather
brazenly
seemed
to
be
guarding
him
she
was
always
there
this
very
apparent
solicitude
of
hers
left
him
feeling
pleasantly
important
despite
the
social
contacts
it
doubtless
deprived
him
of
he
wondered
if
the
montague
girl
could
be
jealous
and
cautiously
one
day
as
they
lolled
in
the
motor
car
he
sounded
her
those
girls
in
the
hotel
scenes
i
suppose
they
re
all
nice
girls
of
good
family
he
casually
observed
huh
demanded
miss
montague
engaged
with
a
pencil
at
the
moment
in
editing
her
left
eyebrow
oh
that
bunch
sure
they
all
come
from
good
old
southern
families
virginia
and
indiana
and
those
she
tightened
her
lips
before
the
little
mirror
she
held
and
renewed
their
scarlet
then
she
spoke
more
seriously
sure
kid
those
girls
are
all
right
enough
they
work
like
dogs
and
do
the
best
they
can
when
they
ain
t
got
jobs
i
m
strong
for
em
but
then
i
m
a
wise
old
trouper
i
understand
things
you
don
t
you
re
the
real
country
wild
rose
of
this
piece
it
s
a
good
thing
you
got
me
to
ride
herd
on
you
you
re
far
too
innocent
to
be
turned
loose
on
a
comedy
lot
listen
boy
she
turned
a
sober
face
to
him
the
straight
lots
are
fairly
decent
but
get
this
a
comedy
lot
is
the
toughest
place
this
side
of
the
bad
one
any
comedy
but
this
isn
t
a
comedy
lot
baird
isn
t
doing
comedies
any
more
and
these
people
all
seem
to
be
nice
people
of
course
some
of
the
ladies
smoke
cigarettes
the
girl
had
averted
her
face
briefly
but
now
turned
to
him
again
of
course
that
s
so
jeff
is
trying
for
the
better
things
but
he
s
still
using
lots
of
his
old
people
they
re
all
right
for
me
but
not
for
you
you
wouldn
t
last
long
if
mother
here
didn
t
look
out
for
you
i
m
playing
your
dear
little
sister
but
i
m
playing
your
mother
too
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
me
this
bunch
would
have
taught
you
a
lot
of
things
you
d
better
learn
some
other
way
just
for
one
thing
long
before
this
you
d
probably
been
hopping
up
your
reindeers
and
driving
all
over
in
a
chinese
he
tried
to
make
something
of
this
but
found
the
words
meaningless
they
merely
suggested
to
him
a
snowy
winter
scene
of
santa
claus
and
his
innocent
equipage
but
he
would
intimate
that
he
understood
oh
i
guess
not
he
said
knowingly
the
girl
appeared
not
to
have
heard
this
bit
of
pretense
on
a
comedy
lot
she
said
again
becoming
the
oracle
you
can
do
murder
if
you
wipe
up
the
blood
remember
he
did
not
again
refer
to
the
beautiful
young
women
who
came
from
fine
old
southern
homes
the
montague
girl
was
too
emphatic
about
them
at
other
times
during
the
long
waits
perhaps
while
they
ate
lunch
brought
from
the
cafeteria
she
would
tell
him
of
herself
his
old
troubling
visions
of
his
of
beulah
baxter
the
daring
had
faded
but
now
and
then
they
would
recur
as
if
from
long
habit
and
he
would
question
the
girl
about
her
life
as
a
double
yeah
i
could
see
that
baxter
business
was
a
blow
to
you
kid
you
d
kind
of
worshiped
her
hadn
t
you
well
i
yes
in
a
sort
of
way
of
course
you
did
it
was
very
nice
of
you
she
reached
over
to
pat
his
hand
mother
understands
just
how
you
felt
watching
the
films
back
there
in
gooseberry
he
had
quit
trying
to
correct
her
as
to
gashwiler
and
simsbury
she
had
hit
upon
gooseberry
as
a
working
composite
of
both
names
and
he
had
wearily
come
to
accept
it
and
i
know
just
how
you
felt
again
she
patted
his
hand
that
night
when
you
found
me
doing
her
it
did
kind
of
upset
sure
it
would
but
you
ought
to
have
known
that
all
these
people
use
doubles
when
they
can
men
and
women
both
it
not
only
saves
em
work
but
even
where
they
could
do
the
stuff
if
they
had
to
and
that
ain
t
so
often
it
saves
em
broken
bones
and
holding
up
a
big
production
two
or
three
months
fine
business
that
would
be
so
when
you
see
a
woman
or
a
man
either
doing
something
that
someone
else
could
do
you
can
bet
someone
else
is
doing
it
what
would
you
expect
would
you
expect
a
star
to
go
out
and
break
his
leg
and
at
that
most
of
the
doubles
are
men
even
for
the
women
stars
like
kitty
carson
always
carries
one
who
used
to
be
a
circus
acrobat
she
couldn
t
hardly
do
one
of
the
things
you
see
her
doing
but
when
old
dan
gets
on
her
blonde
transformation
and
a
few
of
her
clothes
he
s
her
to
the
life
in
a
long
shot
or
even
in
mediums
if
he
keeps
his
map
covered
yeah
most
of
the
doublers
have
to
be
men
i
ll
hand
that
to
myself
i
m
about
the
only
girl
that
s
been
doing
it
and
that
s
out
with
me
hereafter
i
guess
the
way
i
seem
to
be
making
good
with
jeff
maybe
after
this
i
won
t
have
to
do
stunts
except
of
course
some
riding
stuff
prob
ly
or
a
row
of
flips
or
something
light
anything
heavy
comes
up
me
for
a
double
of
my
she
glanced
sidewise
at
her
listener
then
you
won
t
like
me
any
more
hey
kid
after
you
find
out
i
m
using
a
double
he
had
listened
attentively
absorbed
in
her
talk
and
seemed
startled
by
this
unforeseen
finish
he
turned
anxious
eyes
on
her
it
occurred
to
him
for
the
first
time
that
he
did
not
wish
the
montague
girl
to
do
dangerous
things
any
more
say
he
said
quickly
amazed
at
his
own
discovery
i
wish
you
d
quit
doing
all
those
stunts
do
you
call
em
why
she
demanded
there
were
those
puzzling
lights
back
in
her
eyes
as
he
met
them
he
was
confused
well
you
might
get
oh
you
might
get
killed
sometime
and
it
wouldn
t
make
the
least
difference
to
me
your
using
a
double
i
d
like
you
just
the
i
see
it
wouldn
t
be
the
way
it
was
with
baxter
when
you
found
it
no
you
you
re
different
i
don
t
want
you
to
get
killed
he
added
rather
blankly
he
was
still
amazed
at
this
discovery
all
right
kid
i
won
t
she
replied
soothingly
i
ll
like
you
just
as
much
he
again
assured
her
no
matter
how
many
doubles
you
well
you
ll
be
having
doubles
yourself
sooner
or
later
and
i
ll
like
you
she
reached
over
to
his
hand
but
this
time
she
held
it
he
returned
her
strong
clasp
he
had
not
liked
to
think
of
her
being
mangled
perhaps
by
a
fall
into
a
quarry
when
the
cable
gave
way
and
the
camera
men
would
probably
keep
on
turning
i
always
been
funny
about
men
she
presently
spoke
again
still
gripping
his
hand
lord
knows
i
ve
seen
enough
of
all
kinds
bad
and
good
but
i
always
been
kind
of
afraid
even
of
the
good
ones
any
one
might
not
think
it
but
i
guess
i
m
just
shy
he
glowed
with
a
confession
of
his
own
you
know
i
m
that
way
too
i
felt
awful
awkward
when
i
had
to
kiss
you
in
the
other
piece
i
never
did
really
he
floundered
a
moment
but
was
presently
blurting
out
the
meagre
details
of
that
early
amour
with
edwina
may
pulver
he
stopped
this
recital
in
a
sudden
panic
fear
that
the
girl
would
make
fun
of
him
he
was
immensely
relieved
when
she
merely
renewed
the
strength
of
the
handclasp
i
know
that
s
the
way
with
me
of
course
i
can
put
over
the
acting
stuff
even
vamping
but
i
m
afraid
of
men
say
would
you
believe
it
i
ain
t
ever
had
but
one
beau
that
was
bert
stacy
poor
old
bert
he
was
lots
older
than
me
about
thirty
i
guess
he
was
white
all
through
you
always
kind
of
remind
me
of
him
sort
of
a
feckless
dub
he
was
too
kind
of
honest
and
awkward
you
know
he
was
the
one
got
me
doing
stunts
he
wasn
t
afraid
of
anything
didn
t
know
it
was
even
in
the
dictionary
that
old
scout
would
go
out
night
or
day
and
break
everything
but
his
contract
i
was
twelve
when
i
first
knew
him
and
he
had
me
doing
twisters
in
no
time
i
caught
on
to
the
other
stuff
pretty
good
i
wasn
t
afraid
either
i
ll
say
that
for
myself
first
i
was
afraid
to
show
him
i
was
afraid
but
pretty
soon
i
wasn
t
afraid
at
all
we
pulled
off
a
lot
of
stuff
for
different
people
and
of
course
i
got
to
be
a
big
girl
and
three
years
ago
when
i
was
eighteen
bert
wanted
us
to
be
married
and
i
thought
i
might
as
well
he
was
the
only
one
i
hadn
t
been
afraid
of
so
we
got
engaged
i
was
still
kind
of
afraid
to
marry
any
one
but
being
engaged
was
all
right
i
know
we
d
got
along
together
too
but
then
he
got
his
with
a
motorcycle
kind
of
funny
he
d
do
anything
on
that
machine
he
d
jump
clean
over
an
auto
and
he
d
leap
a
ditch
and
he
was
all
set
to
pull
a
new
one
for
jeff
baird
when
it
happened
jeff
was
going
to
have
him
ride
his
motorcycle
through
a
window
the
set
was
built
and
everything
ready
and
then
the
merry
old
sun
don
t
shine
for
three
days
every
morning
bert
would
go
over
to
the
lot
and
wait
around
in
the
fog
and
this
third
day
when
it
got
too
late
in
the
afternoon
to
shoot
even
if
the
sun
did
show
he
says
to
me
c
mon
hop
up
and
let
s
take
a
ride
down
to
the
so
i
hop
to
the
back
seat
and
off
we
start
and
on
a
paved
boulevard
what
does
bert
do
but
get
caught
in
a
jam
it
was
an
ice
wagon
that
finally
bumped
us
over
i
was
shook
up
and
scraped
here
and
there
but
bert
was
finished
that
s
the
funny
part
he
d
got
it
on
this
boulevard
but
back
on
the
lot
he
d
have
rode
through
that
window
probably
without
a
scratch
and
just
because
the
sun
didn
t
shine
that
day
i
wasn
t
engaged
any
more
bert
was
kind
of
like
some
old
that
comes
back
to
shore
after
risking
his
life
on
the
ocean
in
all
kinds
of
storms
and
falls
into
a
and
gets
she
sat
a
long
time
staring
out
over
the
landscape
still
holding
his
hand
inside
the
fence
before
the
farmhouse
three
of
the
new
york
villains
were
again
engaged
in
athletic
sports
but
she
seemed
oblivious
of
these
at
last
she
turned
to
him
again
with
an
illumining
smile
but
i
was
dead
in
love
once
before
that
and
that
s
how
i
know
just
how
you
feel
about
baxter
he
was
the
preacher
where
we
used
to
go
to
church
he
was
a
good
one
pa
copied
a
lot
of
his
stuff
that
he
uses
to
this
day
if
he
happens
to
get
a
preacher
part
he
was
the
loveliest
thing
not
so
young
but
dark
with
wonderful
eyes
and
black
hair
and
his
voice
would
go
all
through
you
i
had
an
awful
case
on
him
i
was
twelve
and
all
week
i
used
to
think
how
i
d
see
him
the
next
sunday
say
when
i
d
get
there
and
he
d
be
working
doing
pulpit
stuff
he
d
have
me
in
kind
of
a
trance
sometimes
after
the
pulpit
scene
he
d
come
down
right
into
the
audience
and
shake
hands
with
people
i
d
almost
keel
over
if
he
d
notice
me
i
d
be
afraid
if
he
would
and
afraid
if
he
wouldn
t
if
he
said
and
how
is
the
little
lady
this
morning
i
wouldn
t
have
a
speck
of
voice
to
answer
him
i
d
just
tremble
all
over
i
used
to
dream
i
d
get
a
job
workin
for
him
as
extra
blacking
his
shoes
or
fetching
his
breakfast
and
things
it
was
the
real
thing
all
right
i
used
to
try
to
pray
the
way
he
did
asking
the
lord
to
let
me
do
a
character
bit
or
something
with
him
he
had
me
going
all
right
you
must
a
been
that
way
about
baxter
sure
you
were
when
you
found
she
was
married
and
used
a
double
and
everything
it
was
like
i
d
found
this
preacher
shooting
hop
or
using
a
double
in
his
pulpit
she
was
still
again
looking
back
upon
this
tremendous
episode
yes
that
s
about
the
way
i
felt
he
told
her
already
his
affair
with
rosenblatt
seemed
a
thing
of
his
childhood
he
was
wondering
rather
if
the
preacher
could
have
been
the
perfect
creature
the
girl
was
now
picturing
him
it
would
not
have
displeased
him
to
learn
that
this
refulgent
being
had
actually
used
a
double
in
his
big
scenes
or
had
been
guilty
of
mere
human
behaviour
at
odd
moments
probably
after
all
he
had
been
just
a
preacher
uncle
sylvester
used
to
want
me
to
be
a
preacher
he
said
with
apparent
irrelevance
even
if
he
was
his
own
worst
he
added
presently
as
the
girl
remained
silent
i
always
say
my
prayers
at
he
felt
vaguely
that
this
might
raise
him
to
the
place
of
the
other
who
had
been
adored
he
was
wishing
to
be
thought
well
of
by
this
girl
she
was
aroused
from
her
musing
by
his
confession
you
do
now
ain
t
that
just
like
you
i
d
have
bet
you
did
that
well
keep
on
son
it
s
good
her
serious
mood
seemed
to
pass
she
was
presently
exchanging
tart
repartee
with
the
new
york
villains
who
had
perched
in
a
row
on
the
fence
to
be
funny
about
that
long
continued
holding
of
hands
in
the
motor
car
she
was
quite
unembarrassed
however
as
she
dropped
the
hand
with
a
final
pat
and
vaulted
to
the
ground
over
the
side
of
the
car
get
busy
there
she
ordered
where
s
your
understander
where
s
your
she
became
a
circus
ringmaster
three
up
and
a
roll
for
yours
she
commanded
the
three
villains
aligned
themselves
on
the
lawn
one
climbed
to
the
shoulders
of
the
other
and
a
third
found
footing
on
the
second
they
balanced
there
presently
to
lean
forward
from
the
summit
the
girl
played
upon
an
imaginary
snare
drum
with
a
guttural
throaty
imitation
of
its
roll
culminating
in
the
boom
of
a
as
the
tower
toppled
to
earth
its
units
completing
their
turn
with
somersaults
again
stood
in
line
bowing
and
smirking
their
acknowledgments
for
imagined
applause
the
girl
a
moment
later
was
turning
merton
had
never
known
that
actors
were
so
versatile
it
was
an
astounding
profession
he
thought
remembering
his
own
registration
card
that
he
had
filled
out
at
the
holden
office
his
age
height
weight
hair
eyes
and
his
chest
and
waist
measures
these
had
been
specified
and
then
he
had
been
obliged
to
write
the
short
no
after
ride
drive
swim
dance
to
write
no
after
ride
even
in
the
artistically
photographed
presence
of
buck
benson
on
horseback
yet
in
spite
of
these
disabilities
he
was
now
a
successful
actor
at
an
enormous
salary
baird
was
already
saying
that
he
would
soon
have
a
contract
for
him
to
sign
at
a
still
larger
figure
seemingly
it
was
a
profession
in
which
you
could
rise
even
if
you
were
not
able
to
turn
or
were
more
or
less
terrified
by
horses
and
deep
water
and
dance
music
and
the
montague
girl
who
he
now
fervently
hoped
would
not
be
killed
while
doubling
for
rosenblatt
was
a
puzzling
creature
he
thought
his
hand
must
still
be
warm
from
her
enfolding
of
it
even
when
work
was
resumed
and
he
saw
her
with
sunbonnet
pushed
back
stand
at
the
gate
of
the
little
farmhouse
and
behave
in
an
utterly
brazen
manner
toward
one
of
the
new
york
clubmen
who
was
luring
her
up
to
the
great
city
she
who
had
just
confided
to
him
that
she
was
afraid
of
men
was
now
practically
daring
an
undoubted
scoundrel
to
lure
her
up
to
the
great
city
and
make
a
lady
of
her
and
she
had
been
afraid
of
all
but
a
clergyman
and
a
stunt
actor
he
wondered
interestingly
if
she
were
afraid
of
merton
gill
she
seemed
not
to
be
on
another
day
of
long
waits
they
ate
their
lunch
from
the
cafeteria
box
on
the
steps
of
the
little
home
and
discussed
stage
names
i
guess
we
better
can
that
clifford
armytage
stuff
she
told
him
as
she
seriously
munched
a
sandwich
we
don
t
need
it
that
s
out
merton
gill
is
a
lot
better
she
had
used
we
quite
as
if
it
were
a
community
name
well
if
you
think
so
he
began
regretfully
for
clifford
armytage
still
seemed
superior
to
the
indistinction
of
merton
gill
sure
it
s
a
lot
better
she
went
on
that
clifford
armytage
say
it
reminds
me
of
just
another
such
feckless
dub
as
you
that
acted
with
us
one
time
when
we
all
trouped
in
a
rep
show
playing
east
lynne
and
such
things
he
was
just
as
wise
as
you
are
and
when
he
joined
out
at
kansas
city
they
gave
him
a
whole
book
of
the
piece
instead
of
just
his
sides
he
was
a
quick
study
at
that
only
he
learned
everybody
s
part
as
well
as
his
own
and
that
slowed
him
they
put
him
on
in
waco
and
the
manager
was
laid
up
so
they
told
him
that
after
the
third
act
he
was
to
go
out
and
announce
the
bill
for
the
next
night
and
he
learned
that
speech
too
he
got
on
fine
till
the
big
scene
in
the
third
act
then
he
went
bloody
because
that
was
as
far
as
he
d
learned
so
he
just
left
the
scene
cold
and
walked
down
to
the
foots
and
bowed
and
said
ladies
and
gentlemen
we
thank
you
for
your
attendance
here
this
evening
and
night
we
shall
have
the
honour
of
presenting
lady
audley
s
with
that
he
gave
a
cold
look
to
the
actors
back
of
him
that
were
gasping
like
fish
and
walked
off
and
he
was
like
you
in
another
way
because
his
real
name
was
eddie
duffy
and
the
lovely
stage
name
he
d
picked
out
was
clyde
well
clifford
armytage
is
out
then
merton
announced
feeling
that
he
had
now
buried
a
part
of
his
dead
self
in
a
grave
where
beulah
baxter
the
already
lay
interred
still
he
was
conscious
of
a
certain
relief
the
stage
name
had
been
bothersome
it
ain
t
as
if
you
had
a
name
like
mine
the
girl
went
on
i
simply
had
to
have
he
wondered
what
her
own
name
was
he
had
never
heard
her
called
anything
but
the
absurd
and
undignified
she
caught
the
question
he
had
looked
well
my
name
is
sarah
nevada
montague
sarah
for
ma
and
nevada
for
reno
where
ma
had
to
stop
off
for
me
she
was
out
of
the
company
two
weeks
and
if
you
ever
tell
a
soul
i
ll
have
the
law
on
you
that
was
a
fine
way
to
abuse
a
helpless
baby
wasn
t
it
but
sarah
is
all
right
i
like
do
you
kid
she
patted
his
hand
all
right
then
but
it
s
only
for
your
personal
of
course
the
nevada
he
hesitated
it
does
sound
kind
of
like
a
geography
lesson
or
something
but
i
think
i
ll
call
you
sarah
i
mean
when
we
re
well
that
s
more
than
ma
ever
does
and
you
bet
it
ll
never
get
into
my
press
notices
but
go
ahead
if
you
want
i
will
sarah
it
sounds
more
like
a
true
woman
than
bless
the
child
s
heart
she
murmured
and
reached
across
the
lunch
box
to
pat
his
hand
again
you
re
a
great
little
patter
sarah
he
observed
with
one
of
his
infrequent
attempts
at
humour
on
still
another
day
while
they
idled
between
scenes
she
talked
to
him
about
salaries
and
contracts
again
with
her
important
air
of
mothering
him
after
this
picture
she
told
him
jeff
was
going
to
sew
you
up
with
a
contract
probably
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
per
but
i
ve
told
him
plain
i
won
t
stand
for
it
no
contract
and
not
any
contract
at
that
figure
maybe
three
years
at
two
hundred
and
fifty
i
haven
t
decided
yet
i
ll
wait
and
see
she
broke
off
to
regard
him
with
that
old
puzzling
light
far
back
in
her
eyes
wait
and
see
how
you
get
over
in
these
two
but
i
know
you
ll
go
big
and
so
does
jeff
we
ve
caught
you
in
the
rushes
enough
to
know
that
and
jeff
s
a
good
fellow
but
naturally
he
ll
get
you
for
as
little
as
he
can
he
knows
all
about
money
even
if
he
don
t
keep
yom
kippur
so
i
m
watching
over
you
son
i
m
your
manager
see
and
i
ve
told
him
so
plain
he
knows
he
ll
have
to
give
you
just
what
you
re
worth
of
course
he
s
entitled
to
consideration
for
digging
you
up
and
developing
you
but
a
contract
will
pay
him
out
for
that
trust
i
do
he
told
her
i
d
be
helpless
without
you
it
kind
of
scares
me
to
think
of
getting
all
that
money
i
won
t
know
what
to
do
with
i
will
you
always
listen
to
me
and
you
won
t
be
camping
on
the
lot
any
more
and
don
t
shoot
dice
with
these
on
the
i
won
t
he
assured
her
i
don
t
believe
in
he
wondered
about
sarah
s
own
salary
and
was
surprised
to
learn
that
it
was
now
double
his
own
it
was
surprising
because
her
acting
seemed
not
so
important
to
the
piece
as
his
it
seems
like
a
lot
of
money
for
what
you
have
to
do
he
said
there
she
smiled
warmly
didn
t
i
always
say
you
were
a
trouper
well
it
is
a
lot
of
money
for
me
but
you
see
i
ve
helped
jeff
dope
out
both
of
these
pieces
i
m
not
so
bad
at
gags
i
mean
the
kind
of
stuff
he
needs
in
these
serious
dramas
this
big
scene
of
yours
where
you
go
off
to
the
city
and
come
back
a
wreck
on
christmas
night
that
s
mine
i
doped
it
out
after
the
piece
was
started
after
i
d
had
a
good
look
at
the
truck
driver
that
plays
opposite
truck
driver
it
appeared
that
miss
montague
was
actually
applying
this
term
to
the
new
york
society
girl
who
in
private
life
was
burdened
with
an
ailing
family
he
explained
now
that
baird
had
not
considered
her
ideal
for
the
part
but
had
chosen
her
out
of
kindness
again
there
flickered
far
back
in
her
eyes
those
lights
that
baffled
him
there
was
incredulity
in
her
look
but
she
seemed
to
master
it
but
i
think
it
was
wonderful
of
you
he
continued
to
write
that
beautiful
scene
it
s
a
strong
scene
sarah
i
didn
t
know
you
could
write
too
it
s
as
good
as
anything
tessie
kearns
ever
did
and
she
s
written
a
lot
of
strong
miss
montague
seemed
to
struggle
with
some
unidentified
emotion
after
a
long
puzzling
gaze
she
suddenly
said
merton
gill
you
come
right
here
with
all
that
on
and
give
mother
a
good
big
kiss
astonishingly
to
himself
he
did
so
in
the
full
light
of
day
and
under
the
eyes
of
one
of
the
new
york
villains
who
had
been
pretending
that
he
walked
a
across
the
yard
after
he
had
kissed
the
girl
she
seized
him
by
both
arms
and
shook
him
i
d
ought
to
have
been
using
my
own
face
in
that
scene
she
said
then
she
patted
his
shoulder
and
told
him
that
he
was
a
good
boy
the
pretending
walker
had
paused
to
applaud
your
act
s
flopping
bo
said
miss
montague
work
then
she
again
addressed
the
good
boy
wait
till
you
ve
watched
that
scene
before
you
thank
me
she
said
shortly
but
it
s
a
strong
scene
he
insisted
yes
she
agreed
it
s
he
told
her
of
the
other
instance
of
baird
s
kindness
of
heart
you
know
i
was
a
little
afraid
of
playing
scenes
with
the
man
but
baird
said
he
was
trying
so
hard
to
do
serious
work
so
i
wouldn
t
have
him
discharged
but
shouldn
t
you
think
he
d
save
up
and
have
his
eyes
straightened
does
he
get
a
very
small
salary
the
girl
seemed
again
to
be
harassed
by
conflicting
emotions
but
mastered
them
to
say
i
don
t
know
exactly
what
it
is
but
i
guess
he
draws
down
about
twelve
fifty
a
only
twelve
dollars
and
fifty
cents
a
week
twelve
hundred
and
fifty
said
the
girl
firmly
twelve
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
week
this
was
monstrous
incredible
but
then
why
doesn
t
he
have
his
eyes
miss
montague
drew
him
to
her
with
both
her
capable
arms
my
boy
my
boy
she
murmured
and
upon
his
painted
forehead
she
now
imprinted
a
kiss
of
deep
reverence
run
along
and
play
she
ordered
you
re
getting
me
all
forthwith
she
moved
to
the
centre
of
the
yard
where
the
walker
still
endangered
his
life
above
the
heads
of
a
vast
audience
she
joined
him
she
became
a
performer
on
the
slack
wire
with
a
parasol
to
balance
her
she
ran
to
the
centre
of
an
imaginary
wire
that
swayed
perilously
and
she
swung
there
cunningly
maintaining
a
precarious
balance
then
she
sped
back
to
safety
at
the
wire
s
end
threw
down
her
parasol
caught
the
handkerchief
thrown
to
her
by
the
first
performer
and
daintily
touched
her
face
with
it
breathing
deeply
the
while
and
bowing
he
thought
sarah
was
a
strange
child
one
minute
one
thing
and
the
next
minute
something
chapter

miss
montague
uses
her
own
face
work
on
the
piece
dragged
slowly
to
an
end
in
these
latter
days
the
earnest
young
leading
man
suffered
spells
of
concern
for
his
employer
he
was
afraid
that
baird
in
his
effort
to
struggle
out
of
the
slough
of
low
comedy
was
not
going
to
be
wholly
successful
he
had
begun
to
note
that
the
actors
employed
for
this
purpose
were
not
invariably
serious
even
when
the
cameras
turned
or
if
serious
they
seemed
perhaps
from
the
earnestness
of
their
striving
for
the
drama
to
be
a
shade
too
serious
they
were
often
he
felt
in
their
methods
still
they
were
he
was
certain
good
actors
one
could
always
tell
what
they
meant
it
was
at
these
times
that
he
especially
wished
he
might
be
allowed
to
view
the
he
not
only
wished
to
assure
himself
for
baird
s
sake
that
the
piece
would
be
acceptably
serious
but
he
wished
with
a
quite
seemly
curiosity
to
view
his
own
acting
on
the
screen
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
been
acting
a
long
time
without
a
glimpse
of
himself
but
baird
had
been
singularly
firm
in
this
matter
and
the
montague
girl
had
sided
with
him
it
was
best
they
said
for
a
beginning
actor
not
to
see
himself
at
first
it
might
affect
his
method
before
this
had
crystallized
make
them
artificial
he
was
obliged
to
believe
that
these
of
his
knew
best
he
must
not
then
trifle
with
a
screen
success
that
seemed
assured
he
tried
to
be
content
with
this
decision
but
always
the
misgivings
would
return
he
would
not
be
really
content
until
he
had
watched
his
own
triumph
soon
this
would
be
so
securely
his
privilege
that
not
even
baird
could
deny
it
for
the
first
piece
in
which
he
had
worked
was
about
to
be
shown
he
looked
forward
to
that
it
was
toward
the
end
of
the
picture
that
his
intimacy
with
the
montague
girl
grew
to
a
point
where
returning
from
location
to
the
studio
late
they
would
dine
together
hurry
and
get
ungreased
son
she
would
say
and
you
can
take
an
actress
out
to
sometimes
they
would
patronize
the
cafeteria
on
the
lot
but
oftener
in
a
spirit
of
adventure
they
would
search
out
exotic
restaurants
a
picture
might
follow
after
which
by
he
would
escort
her
to
the
montague
home
in
a
remote
flat
region
of
avenues
sparsely
set
with
new
bungalows
she
would
disquiet
him
at
these
times
by
insisting
that
she
pay
her
share
of
the
expense
and
she
proved
to
have
no
mean
talent
for
petty
finance
for
she
remembered
every
item
down
to
the
fares
even
to
merton
gill
she
seemed
very
much
a
child
once
she
stepped
from
the
domain
of
her
trade
she
would
stare
into
shop
windows
wonderingly
and
never
failed
to
evince
the
most
childish
delight
when
they
ventured
to
dine
at
an
establishment
other
than
a
cafeteria
at
times
when
they
waited
for
a
car
after
these
dissipations
he
suffered
a
not
unpleasant
alarm
at
sight
of
a
advertisement
along
the
back
of
a
bench
on
which
they
would
sit
you
furnish
the
girl
we
furnish
the
house
screamed
the
bench
to
him
above
the
name
of
an
enterprising
tradesman
that
came
in
time
to
bite
itself
deeply
into
his
memory
of
course
it
would
be
absurd
but
stranger
things
he
thought
had
happened
he
wondered
if
the
girl
was
as
afraid
of
him
as
of
other
men
she
seemed
not
to
be
but
you
couldn
t
tell
much
about
her
she
had
kissed
him
one
day
with
a
strange
warmth
of
manner
but
it
had
been
quite
publicly
in
the
presence
of
other
people
when
he
left
her
at
her
door
now
it
was
after
the
least
sentimental
of
partings
perhaps
a
shake
of
her
hard
little
hand
or
perhaps
only
a
s
long
see
you
at
the
it
was
on
one
of
these
nights
that
she
first
invited
him
to
dine
with
the
montague
family
i
tried
last
night
to
get
you
on
the
telephone
she
explained
but
they
kept
giving
me
someone
else
or
maybe
i
called
wrong
ain
t
these
los
angeles
telephone
numbers
the
limit
when
you
call
or
something
it
sounds
like
paging
a
i
was
going
to
ask
you
over
ma
had
cooked
a
lovely
mess
of
corned
beef
and
cabbage
anyway
you
come
eat
with
us
night
will
you
she
ll
have
something
else
cooked
up
that
will
stick
to
the
merry
old
slats
you
can
come
home
with
me
when
we
get
in
from
so
it
was
that
on
the
following
night
he
enjoyed
a
home
evening
with
the
montagues
montague
had
indeed
cooked
up
something
else
and
had
done
it
well
while
montague
offered
at
the
sideboard
a
choice
of
amateur
distillations
and
brews
which
he
warmly
recommended
to
the
guest
while
the
guest
timidly
considered
having
had
but
the
slightest
experience
with
intoxicants
it
developed
that
the
confidence
placed
in
his
product
by
the
hospitable
old
craftsman
was
not
shared
by
his
daughter
keep
off
it
she
warned
and
then
to
her
father
say
listen
pa
have
a
heart
that
boy
s
got
to
work
so
be
it
my
child
replied
montague
with
a
visible
stiffening
of
manner
sylvester
montague
is
not
the
man
to
urge
strong
drink
upon
the
reluctant
or
the
i
shall
drink
my
aperatif
go
to
it
old
pippin
rejoined
his
daughter
as
she
vanished
to
the
kitchen
still
a
little
dish
of
liquor
at
this
hour
continued
the
host
suggestively
when
they
were
alone
well
merton
wished
the
girl
had
stayed
perhaps
just
a
few
precisely
my
boy
precisely
a
mere
he
poured
the
mere
dram
and
his
guest
drank
it
was
a
colourless
fiery
stuff
with
an
elusive
taste
of
metal
merton
contrived
an
expression
of
pleasure
under
the
searching
glance
of
his
host
ah
i
knew
you
would
relish
it
i
fancy
i
could
amaze
you
if
i
told
you
how
recently
it
was
made
now
here
he
grasped
another
bottle
purposely
is
something
a
full
ten
days
older
it
has
developed
quite
a
bouquet
just
a
drop
the
guest
graciously
yet
firmly
waved
a
negation
thanks
he
said
but
i
want
to
enjoy
the
last
it
it
has
so
much
it
has
it
has
indeed
i
ll
not
urge
you
of
course
later
you
must
see
the
simple
mechanism
by
which
i
work
these
wonders
alone
then
i
drink
to
montague
alone
drank
of
two
other
fruits
of
his
loom
before
the
ladies
appeared
with
dinner
he
was
clean
shaven
now
and
his
fine
face
glowed
with
hospitality
as
he
carved
roast
chickens
the
talk
was
of
the
shop
of
what
montague
scornfully
called
grind
shows
when
his
daughter
led
it
and
of
the
legitimate
when
he
gained
the
leadership
he
believed
that
moving
pictures
had
sounded
the
knell
of
true
dramatic
art
and
said
so
in
many
ways
he
tried
to
imagine
the
sensations
of
lawrence
barrett
or
louis
james
could
they
behold
sylvester
montague
whom
both
these
gentlemen
had
proclaimed
to
be
no
mean
artist
enacting
the
role
of
a
rowdy
five
days
on
end
by
reclining
upon
a
sawdust
floor
with
his
back
supported
by
a
spirits
barrel
the
supposititious
comments
of
the
two
placed
upon
the
industry
the
black
guilt
of
having
degraded
a
sterling
artist
to
the
level
of
a
mountebank
they
were
frankly
disgusted
at
the
spectacle
and
their
present
spokesman
thought
it
as
well
that
they
had
not
actually
lived
to
witness
it
even
the
happier
phases
of
this
art
in
which
a
mere
chit
of
a
girl
might
earn
a
living
wage
by
falling
downstairs
for
a
star
or
the
whippersnapper
merton
gill
flinched
in
spite
of
himself
could
name
his
own
salary
for
merely
possessing
a
dimpled
chin
further
an
artist
in
the
art
received
his
payment
as
if
he
had
delivered
groceries
at
one
s
back
door
you
i
believe
the
speaker
addressed
his
guest
are
at
present
upon
a
but
there
are
others
your
your
betters
though
i
do
not
say
that
you
better
not
remarked
his
daughter
only
to
be
ignored
others
who
must
work
a
day
and
at
the
close
of
it
receive
a
slip
of
paper
emblazoned
talent
pay
how
more
effectively
could
they
cheapen
the
good
word
talent
and
at
the
foot
of
this
slip
you
are
made
to
sign
before
receiving
the
pittance
you
have
earned
a
consent
to
the
public
exhibition
for
the
purpose
of
trade
or
advertising
of
the
pictures
for
which
you
may
have
posed
could
tradesmen
descend
to
a
lower
level
i
ask
you
i
ll
have
one
for
twelve
fifty
night
said
montague
not
too
dismally
i
got
to
do
a
duchess
at
a
reception
and
i
certainly
hope
my
feet
don
t
hurt
me
cheer
up
old
dears
pretty
soon
you
can
both
pick
your
parts
chirped
their
daughter
jeff
s
going
to
give
me
a
contract
and
then
you
can
loaf
forever
for
all
i
care
only
i
know
you
won
t
and
you
know
you
won
t
both
of
you
d
act
for
nothing
if
you
couldn
t
do
it
for
money
what
s
the
use
of
pretending
the
chit
may
be
right
she
may
be
right
conceded
montague
sadly
later
while
the
ladies
were
again
in
the
kitchen
montague
after
suggesting
something
in
the
nature
of
an
cordial
quaffed
one
for
himself
and
followed
it
with
the
one
he
had
poured
out
for
a
declining
guest
who
still
treasured
the
flavour
of
his
one
aperitif
he
then
led
the
way
to
the
small
parlour
where
he
placed
in
action
on
the
phonograph
a
record
said
to
contain
the
ravings
of
john
mccullough
in
his
last
hours
he
listened
to
this
emotionally
that
s
the
sort
of
technique
he
said
that
the
so
called
silver
screen
has
made
but
a
he
lighted
his
pipe
and
identified
various
framed
photographs
that
enlivened
the
walls
of
the
little
room
many
of
them
were
of
himself
at
an
earlier
age
my
dear
he
said
pointing
to
another
a
sterling
artist
and
in
her
time
an
ornament
of
the
speaking
stage
i
was
on
tour
when
her
last
days
came
she
idolized
me
and
passed
away
with
my
name
on
her
lips
her
last
request
was
that
a
photograph
of
me
should
be
placed
in
her
casket
before
it
went
to
its
final
resting
he
paused
his
emotion
threatening
to
overcome
him
presently
he
brushed
a
hand
across
his
eyes
and
continued
i
discovered
later
that
they
had
picked
out
the
most
wretched
of
all
my
photographs
an
atrocious
thing
i
had
supposed
was
destroyed
can
you
imagine
it
apparently
it
was
but
the
entrance
of
his
daughter
that
saved
him
from
an
affecting
collapse
his
daughter
removed
the
record
of
john
mccullough
s
ravings
sniffed
at
it
and
put
a
in
its
place
he
s
got
to
learn
to
dance
she
explained
laying
hands
upon
the
guest
dancing
dancing
murmured
montague
as
if
the
very
word
recalled
bitter
memories
with
brimming
eyes
he
sat
beating
time
to
the
measure
while
merton
gill
proved
to
all
observers
that
his
mastery
of
this
dance
would
if
ever
at
all
achieved
be
only
after
long
and
discouraging
effort
you
forget
all
about
your
feet
remarked
the
girl
as
they
paused
swaying
to
the
rhythm
remember
the
feet
they
re
important
in
a
dance
now
but
it
was
hard
to
remember
his
feet
or
when
he
did
recall
them
to
relate
their
movements
even
distantly
to
the
music
when
this
had
died
despairingly
the
girl
surveyed
her
pupil
with
friendly
but
doubting
eyes
say
pa
don
t
he
remind
you
of
someone
remember
the
squirrel
that
joined
out
with
us
one
time
in
the
rep
show
and
left
east
lynne
flat
right
in
the
middle
of
the
third
act
while
he
went
down
and
announced
the
next
night
s
play
the
one
that
his
name
was
eddie
duffy
and
he
called
himself
clyde
maltravers
in
a
way
in
a
way
agreed
montague
dismally
a
certain
lack
of
finish
in
the
manner
remember
how
charlie
dickman
the
manager
nearly
murdered
him
for
it
in
the
wings
not
that
charlie
didn
t
have
a
right
to
well
this
boy
dances
like
eddie
duffy
would
have
he
was
undeniably
awkward
and
forgetful
said
montague
well
do
i
recall
a
later
night
we
played
under
the
gaslight
charlie
feared
to
trust
him
with
a
part
so
he
kept
the
young
man
off
stage
to
help
with
the
train
noise
when
the
down
express
should
dash
across
but
even
in
this
humble
station
he
proved
inefficient
when
the
train
came
on
he
became
confused
seized
the
cocoanut
shells
instead
of
the
and
our
train
that
night
entered
to
the
sound
of
a
galloping
horse
the
effect
must
have
been
puzzling
to
the
audience
indeed
many
of
them
seemed
to
consider
it
ludicrous
charlie
dickman
confided
in
me
later
syl
my
boy
says
he
this
bird
duffy
has
caused
my
first
gray
it
was
little
wonder
that
he
persuaded
young
duffy
to
abandon
the
drama
he
was
not
meant
for
the
higher
planes
of
our
art
now
our
young
friend
here
he
pointed
to
the
perspiring
merton
gill
doesn
t
even
seem
able
to
master
a
simple
dance
step
i
might
say
that
he
seems
to
duffy
for
duffy
could
dance
after
a
he
ll
make
the
grade
yet
replied
his
daughter
grimly
and
again
the
music
sounded
merton
gill
continued
unconscious
of
his
feet
or
remembering
them
he
became
deaf
to
the
music
but
the
girl
brightened
with
a
sudden
thought
when
next
they
rested
i
got
it
she
announced
we
ll
have
about
two
hundred
feet
of
this
for
the
next
picture
you
trying
to
dance
just
the
way
you
been
doing
with
me
if
you
don
t
close
to
a
good
hand
i
ll
eat
my
last
the
lessons
ceased
she
seemed
no
longer
to
think
it
desirable
that
her
pupil
should
become
proficient
in
the
modern
steps
he
was
puzzled
by
her
decision
why
should
one
of
baird
s
serious
plays
need
an
actor
who
forgot
his
feet
in
a
dance
there
were
more
social
evenings
at
the
montague
home
twice
the
gathering
was
enlarged
by
other
members
of
the
film
colony
a
supper
was
served
and
poker
played
for
inconsiderable
stakes
in
this
game
of
chance
the
montague
girl
proved
to
be
conservative
not
to
say
miserly
and
was
made
to
suffer
genuinely
when
merton
gill
displayed
a
reckless
spirit
in
the
betting
that
he
amassed
winnings
of
cents
one
night
did
not
reassure
her
she
pointed
out
that
he
might
easily
have
lost
this
sum
she
was
indeed
being
a
mother
to
the
defenceless
boy
it
was
after
a
gambling
session
that
she
demanded
to
be
told
what
he
was
doing
with
his
salary
his
careless
hazarding
of
had
caused
her
to
be
fearful
of
his
general
money
sense
merton
gill
had
indeed
been
reckless
he
was
now
he
felt
actually
one
of
the
hollywood
set
he
wondered
how
tessie
kearns
would
regard
his
progress
would
she
be
alarmed
to
know
he
attended
those
gay
parties
that
so
often
brought
the
film
colony
into
unfavourable
public
notice
jolly
dinners
dancing
gambling
drinking
with
actresses
for
montague
had
at
last
turned
out
a
beer
that
met
with
the
approval
not
only
of
his
guests
but
of
his
own
more
exacting
family
the
vivacious
brew
would
now
and
again
behave
unreasonably
at
the
moment
of
being
released
but
it
was
potable
when
subdued
it
was
a
gay
life
merton
felt
and
as
for
the
montague
girl
s
questions
and
warnings
about
his
money
he
would
show
her
he
had
of
course
discharged
his
debt
to
her
in
the
first
two
weeks
of
his
work
with
baird
now
he
would
show
her
what
he
really
thought
of
money
he
would
buy
her
a
gift
whose
presentation
should
mark
a
certain
great
occasion
it
should
occur
on
the
eve
of
his
screen
debut
and
would
fittingly
testify
his
gratitude
for
the
girl
after
all
had
made
him
what
he
was
and
the
first
piece
was
close
to
its
premiere
already
he
had
seen
advance
notices
in
the
newspapers
the
piece
was
called
hearts
on
fire
and
in
it
so
the
notices
said
the
comedy
manager
had
at
last
realized
an
ambition
long
nourished
he
had
done
something
new
and
something
big
a
big
thing
done
in
a
big
way
the
montague
girl
would
see
that
the
leading
man
who
had
done
so
much
to
insure
the
success
of
baird
s
striving
for
the
drama
was
not
unforgetful
of
her
favours
and
continuous
solicitude
he
thought
first
of
a
ring
but
across
the
blank
brick
wall
of
the
jewellery
shop
he
elected
to
patronize
was
an
enormous
sign
in
white
the
house
of
lucky
wedding
rings
this
staring
announcement
so
alarmed
him
that
he
not
only
abandoned
the
plan
for
a
sort
of
ring
might
be
misconstrued
he
in
an
excess
of
caution
chose
another
establishment
not
so
outspoken
if
it
kept
wedding
rings
at
all
it
was
decently
reticent
about
them
and
it
did
keep
a
profusion
of
other
trinkets
about
which
a
possible
recipient
could
entertain
no
false
notions
wrist
watches
for
example
no
one
could
find
subtle
or
hidden
meanings
in
a
wrist
watch
he
chose
a
bauble
that
glittered
prettily
on
its
black
silk
bracelet
and
was
not
shocked
in
the
least
when
told
by
the
engaging
salesman
that
its
price
was
a
sum
for
which
in
the
old
days
gashwiler
had
demanded
a
good
ten
weeks
of
his
life
indeed
it
seemed
rather
cheap
to
him
when
he
remembered
the
event
it
should
celebrate
still
it
was
a
pleasing
trifle
and
did
not
look
cheap
do
you
warrant
it
to
keep
good
time
he
sternly
demanded
the
salesman
became
diplomatic
though
not
without
an
effect
of
genial
frankness
well
i
guess
you
and
i
both
know
what
women
s
he
smiled
a
superior
masculine
smile
that
drew
his
customer
within
the
informed
brotherhood
now
here
there
s
a
platinum
little
thing
that
costs
seven
hundred
and
fifty
and
this
one
you
like
will
keep
just
as
good
time
as
that
one
that
costs
six
hundred
more
what
could
be
fairer
than
that
all
right
said
the
customer
i
ll
take
during
the
remaining
formalities
attending
the
purchase
the
salesman
observing
that
he
dealt
with
a
tolerant
man
of
the
world
became
even
franker
of
course
no
one
he
remarked
pleasantly
while
couching
the
purchase
in
a
chaste
bed
of
white
satin
expects
women
s
to
keep
time
not
even
the
want
em
for
looks
said
the
customer
you
ve
hit
it
you
ve
hit
it
exclaimed
the
salesman
delightedly
as
if
the
customer
had
expertly
probed
the
heart
of
a
mystery
he
had
now
but
to
await
his
great
moment
the
final
scenes
of
the
new
piece
were
shot
again
he
was
resting
between
pictures
as
the
date
for
showing
the
first
piece
drew
near
he
was
puzzled
to
notice
that
both
baird
and
the
montague
girl
curiously
avoided
any
mention
of
it
several
times
he
referred
to
it
in
their
presence
but
they
seemed
resolutely
deaf
to
his
well
i
see
the
big
show
opens
monday
he
wondered
if
there
could
be
some
recondite
bit
of
screen
etiquette
which
he
was
infringing
actors
were
superstitious
he
knew
perhaps
it
boded
bad
luck
to
talk
of
a
forthcoming
production
baird
and
the
girl
not
only
ignored
his
reference
to
hearts
on
fire
but
they
left
baird
looking
curiously
secretive
and
the
montague
girl
looking
curiously
frightened
it
perplexed
him
once
he
was
smitten
with
a
quick
fear
that
his
own
work
in
this
serious
drama
had
not
met
the
expectations
of
the
manager
however
in
this
he
must
be
wrong
for
baird
not
only
continued
cordial
but
as
the
girl
had
prophesied
he
urged
upon
his
new
actor
the
signing
of
a
contract
the
montague
girl
had
insisted
upon
being
present
at
this
interview
after
forbidding
merton
to
put
his
name
to
any
contract
of
which
she
did
not
approve
i
told
jeff
right
out
that
i
was
protecting
you
she
said
he
understands
he
s
got
to
be
it
appeared
as
they
set
about
baird
s
desk
in
the
buckeye
office
that
she
had
been
right
baird
submitted
rather
gracefully
after
but
slight
demur
to
the
terms
which
miss
montague
imposed
in
behalf
of
her
protege
under
her
approving
eye
merton
gill
affixed
his
name
to
a
contract
by
which
baird
was
to
pay
him
a
salary
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
week
for
three
years
it
seemed
an
incredible
sum
as
he
blotted
his
signature
he
was
conscious
of
a
sudden
pity
for
the
manager
the
montague
girl
had
been
hard
hard
as
nails
he
thought
and
baird
a
victim
to
his
own
good
nature
would
probably
lose
a
great
deal
of
money
he
resolved
never
to
press
his
advantage
over
a
man
who
had
been
caught
in
a
weak
moment
i
just
want
to
say
baird
he
began
that
you
needn
t
be
afraid
i
ll
hold
you
to
this
paper
if
you
find
it
s
too
much
money
to
pay
me
i
wouldn
t
have
taken
it
at
all
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
he
pointed
an
almost
accusing
finger
at
the
girl
baird
grinned
the
girl
patted
his
hand
even
at
grave
moments
she
was
a
patter
that
s
all
right
son
she
said
soothingly
jeff
s
got
all
the
best
of
it
and
jeff
knows
it
too
don
t
you
jeff
well
baird
considered
if
his
work
keeps
up
i
m
not
getting
any
the
worst
of
you
said
it
you
know
very
well
what
birds
will
be
looking
for
this
boy
next
week
and
what
money
they
ll
have
in
their
mitts
maybe
said
baird
well
you
got
the
best
of
it
and
you
deserve
to
have
i
ain
t
ever
denied
that
have
i
you
ve
earned
the
best
of
it
the
way
you
ve
handled
him
all
i
m
here
for
i
didn
t
want
you
to
have
too
much
the
best
of
it
see
i
think
i
treated
you
you
re
all
right
well
everything
s
jake
then
everything
s
jake
with
all
right
and
about
his
work
keeping
up
trust
your
old
friend
and
and
say
jeff
her
eyes
gleamed
reminiscently
you
ain
t
caught
him
dancing
yet
well
wait
that
s
all
we
ll
put
on
a
in
the
next
picture
that
will
sure
hog
the
as
this
dialogue
progressed
merton
had
felt
more
and
more
like
a
child
in
the
presence
of
grave
and
knowing
elders
they
had
seemed
to
forget
him
to
forget
that
the
amazing
contract
just
signed
bore
his
name
he
thought
the
montague
girl
was
taking
a
great
deal
upon
herself
her
face
he
noted
when
she
had
stated
terms
to
baird
was
the
face
she
wore
when
risking
a
small
bet
at
poker
on
a
high
hand
she
seemed
old
indeed
but
he
knew
how
he
was
going
to
make
her
feel
younger
in
his
pocket
was
a
gift
of
rare
beauty
even
if
you
couldn
t
run
railway
trains
by
it
and
pretty
things
made
a
child
of
her
baird
shook
hands
with
him
warmly
at
parting
it
ll
be
a
week
yet
before
we
start
on
the
new
piece
have
a
good
time
oh
yes
and
drop
around
some
time
next
week
if
there
s
any
little
thing
you
want
to
talk
over
or
maybe
you
don
t
he
wondered
if
this
were
a
veiled
reference
to
the
piece
about
to
be
shown
certainly
nothing
more
definite
was
said
about
it
yet
it
was
a
thing
that
must
be
of
momentous
interest
to
the
manager
and
the
manager
must
know
that
it
would
be
thrilling
to
the
actor
he
left
with
the
montague
girl
who
had
become
suddenly
grave
and
quiet
but
outside
the
holden
lot
with
one
of
those
quick
transitions
he
had
so
often
remarked
in
her
she
brightened
with
a
desperate
sort
of
gaiety
i
ll
tell
you
what
she
exclaimed
let
s
go
straight
down
town
it
ll
be
six
by
the
time
we
get
there
and
have
the
best
dinner
money
can
buy
lobster
and
chicken
and
vanilla
and
everything
right
in
a
real
restaurant
none
of
this
tray
stuff
and
i
ll
let
you
pay
for
it
all
by
yourself
you
got
a
right
to
after
that
contract
and
we
ll
be
gay
and
all
the
extra
people
that
s
eating
in
the
restaurant
ll
think
we
re
a
couple
o
prominent
film
actors
how
about
it
she
danced
at
his
side
we
ll
have
soup
too
he
amended
one
of
those
thick
ones
that
costs
about
sixty
cents
sixty
cents
just
for
soup
he
repeated
putting
a
hand
to
the
contract
that
now
stiffened
one
side
of
his
coat
well
just
this
once
she
agreed
it
might
be
for
the
last
nothing
like
that
he
assured
her
more
you
spend
more
you
make
that
s
my
they
waited
for
a
car
sitting
again
on
the
bench
that
was
so
outspoken
you
furnish
the
girl
we
furnish
the
home
it
shouted
he
put
his
back
against
several
of
the
bold
words
and
felt
of
the
in
his
pocket
it
might
be
the
last
time
for
me
insisted
the
girl
i
feel
as
if
i
might
die
most
any
time
my
health
s
breaking
down
under
the
strain
i
feel
kind
of
a
fever
coming
on
right
this
maybe
you
shouldn
t
go
yes
i
they
boarded
the
car
and
reached
the
real
restaurant
a
cozy
and
discreet
resort
up
a
flight
of
carpeted
stairs
side
by
side
on
a
seat
that
ran
along
the
wall
they
sat
at
a
table
for
two
and
the
dinner
was
ordered
ruin
yourself
if
you
want
to
said
the
girl
as
her
host
included
celery
and
olives
in
the
menu
go
on
and
order
prunes
too
for
all
i
care
i
m
reckless
maybe
i
ll
never
have
another
dinner
the
way
this
fever
s
coming
on
feel
my
under
the
table
she
wormed
her
hand
into
his
and
kept
it
there
until
food
came
do
my
eyes
look
very
feverish
she
asked
not
so
very
he
assured
her
covering
an
alarm
he
felt
for
the
first
time
she
did
appear
to
be
feverish
and
the
anxiety
of
her
manner
deepened
as
the
meal
progressed
it
developed
quickly
that
she
had
but
scant
appetite
for
the
choice
food
now
being
served
she
could
only
taste
bits
here
and
there
her
plates
were
removed
with
their
delicacies
almost
intact
between
courses
her
hand
would
seek
his
gripping
it
as
if
in
some
nameless
dread
he
became
worried
about
her
state
his
own
appetite
suffered
once
she
said
as
her
hot
hand
clung
to
his
i
know
where
you
ll
be
her
voice
grew
mournful
despairing
and
i
know
perfectly
well
it
s
no
good
asking
you
to
stay
he
let
this
pass
could
it
be
that
the
girl
was
already
babbling
in
delirium
and
all
the
time
she
presently
went
on
i
ll
simply
be
sick
picking
at
the
covers
all
blue
around
the
gills
that
ll
be
me
while
you
re
off
to
your
old
motion
picture
the
art
of
the
motion
picture
she
concluded
with
a
careful
imitation
of
her
father
s
manner
he
tried
to
determine
whether
she
were
serious
or
jesting
you
never
could
tell
about
this
girl
whatever
it
was
it
made
him
uneasy
outside
he
wished
to
take
her
home
in
a
but
she
would
not
hear
to
this
we
ll
use
the
gaston
she
announced
with
a
flash
of
her
old
manner
as
she
waved
to
an
during
the
long
ride
that
followed
she
was
silent
but
restless
tapping
her
foot
shifting
in
her
seat
darting
her
head
about
the
one
thing
she
did
steadily
was
to
clutch
his
arm
during
the
walk
from
the
car
to
the
montague
house
she
twice
indulged
in
her
little
dance
step
even
as
she
clung
to
the
arm
but
each
time
she
seemed
to
think
little
of
it
and
resumed
a
steady
pace
her
head
down
the
house
was
dark
without
speaking
she
unlocked
the
door
and
drew
him
into
the
little
parlour
stand
right
on
that
spot
she
ordered
with
a
final
pat
of
his
shoulder
and
made
her
way
to
the
dining
room
beyond
where
she
turned
on
a
single
light
that
faintly
illumined
the
room
in
which
he
waited
she
came
back
to
him
removed
the
small
cloth
hat
tossed
it
to
a
chair
and
faced
him
silently
the
light
from
the
other
room
shone
across
her
eyes
and
revealed
them
to
him
shadowy
and
mysterious
her
face
was
set
in
some
ominous
control
at
last
she
looked
away
from
him
and
began
in
a
strained
voice
if
anything
happens
to
me
he
thought
it
time
to
end
this
nonsense
she
might
be
feverish
but
it
could
be
nothing
so
serious
as
she
was
intimating
he
clutched
the
gift
sarah
he
said
lightly
i
got
a
little
something
for
you
see
what
i
mean
he
thrust
the
package
into
her
weakly
yielding
hands
she
studied
it
in
the
dusk
turning
it
over
and
over
then
with
no
word
to
him
she
took
it
to
the
dining
room
where
under
the
light
she
opened
it
he
heard
a
smothered
exclamation
that
seemed
more
of
dismay
than
the
delight
he
expected
though
he
saw
that
she
was
holding
the
watch
against
her
wrist
she
came
back
to
the
dusk
of
the
parlour
beginning
on
the
way
one
of
her
little
skipping
dance
steps
which
she
quickly
suppressed
she
was
replacing
the
watch
on
its
splendid
couch
of
satin
and
closing
the
box
i
never
saw
such
a
man
she
exclaimed
with
an
irritation
that
he
felt
to
be
artificial
after
all
you
ve
been
through
i
should
think
you
d
have
learned
the
value
of
money
anyway
it
s
too
beautiful
for
me
and
anyway
i
couldn
t
take
it
not
anyway
and
anyway
her
voice
had
acquired
a
huskiness
in
this
speech
that
now
left
her
incoherent
and
the
light
revealed
a
wetness
in
her
eyes
she
dabbed
at
them
with
a
handkerchief
of
course
you
can
take
it
he
said
in
masterful
tones
after
all
you
ve
done
for
now
you
listen
she
began
you
don
t
know
all
i
ve
done
for
you
you
don
t
know
me
at
all
suppose
something
came
out
about
me
that
you
didn
t
think
i
d
a
been
guilty
of
you
can
t
ever
tell
about
people
in
this
business
you
don
t
know
me
at
one
little
bit
i
might
a
done
lots
of
things
that
would
turn
you
against
me
i
tell
you
you
got
to
wait
and
find
out
about
things
i
haven
t
the
nerve
to
tell
you
but
you
ll
find
out
soon
enough
the
expert
in
photoplays
suffered
a
sudden
illumination
this
was
a
scene
he
could
identify
a
scene
in
which
the
woman
trembled
upon
the
verge
of
revealing
to
the
man
certain
sinister
details
of
her
past
spurred
thereto
by
a
scoundrel
who
blackmailed
her
he
studied
the
girl
in
a
new
light
undoubtedly
from
her
words
he
saw
one
by
the
threatened
exposure
of
some
dreadful
complication
in
her
own
past
certainly
she
was
suffering
i
don
t
care
if
this
fever
does
carry
me
off
she
went
on
i
know
you
could
never
feel
the
same
toward
me
after
you
found
out
again
she
was
dabbing
at
her
eyes
this
time
with
the
sleeve
of
her
jacket
a
suffering
woman
stood
before
him
she
who
had
always
shown
herself
so
competent
to
meet
trouble
with
laughing
looks
was
being
overthrown
by
this
nameless
horror
suddenly
he
knew
that
to
him
it
didn
t
matter
so
very
much
what
crime
she
had
been
guilty
of
i
don
t
care
what
you
ve
done
he
said
his
own
voice
husky
she
continued
to
weep
he
felt
himself
grow
hot
listen
here
kid
he
now
spoke
with
more
than
a
touch
of
the
bully
in
his
tone
stop
this
nonsense
you
you
come
here
and
give
me
a
good
big
kiss
see
what
i
mean
she
looked
up
at
him
from
wet
eyes
and
amazingly
through
her
anguish
she
grinned
you
win
she
said
and
came
to
him
he
was
now
the
masterful
one
he
took
her
protectingly
in
his
arms
he
kissed
her
though
with
no
trace
of
the
parmalee
technique
his
screen
experience
might
never
have
been
it
was
more
like
the
dead
days
of
edwina
may
pulver
now
you
stop
it
he
soothed
all
this
nonsense
his
cheek
was
against
hers
and
his
arms
held
her
what
do
i
care
what
you
ve
done
in
your
past
what
do
i
care
and
listen
here
kid
there
was
again
the
brutal
note
of
the
bully
in
his
voice
don
t
ever
do
any
more
of
those
stunts
see
what
i
mean
none
of
that
falling
off
streetcars
or
houses
or
anything
do
you
hear
he
felt
that
he
was
being
masterful
indeed
he
had
swept
her
off
her
feet
probably
now
she
would
weep
violently
and
sob
out
her
confession
but
a
moment
later
he
was
reflecting
as
he
had
so
many
times
before
reflected
that
you
never
could
tell
about
the
girl
in
his
embrace
she
had
become
astoundingly
calm
that
emotional
crisis
threatening
to
beat
down
all
her
reserves
had
passed
she
reached
up
and
almost
meditatively
pushed
back
the
hair
from
his
forehead
regarding
him
with
eyes
that
were
still
shadowed
but
dry
then
she
gave
him
a
quick
little
hug
and
danced
away
it
was
no
time
for
dancing
he
thought
now
you
sit
down
she
ordered
she
was
almost
gay
again
yet
with
a
nervous
desperate
gaiety
that
would
at
moments
die
to
a
brooding
solemnity
and
listen
she
began
when
he
had
seated
himself
in
bewilderment
at
her
sudden
change
of
mood
you
ll
be
off
to
your
old
motion
picture
night
and
i
ll
be
here
sick
in
bed
i
won
t
go
if
you
don
t
want
me
to
he
put
in
quickly
that
s
no
good
you
d
have
to
go
sometime
the
quicker
the
better
i
guess
i
ll
go
myself
sometime
if
i
ever
get
over
this
disease
that
s
coming
on
me
anyway
you
go
and
then
if
you
ever
see
me
again
you
can
give
me
this
she
quickly
came
to
put
the
watch
back
in
his
hands
yes
yes
take
it
i
won
t
have
it
till
you
give
it
to
me
again
if
i
m
still
she
held
up
repulsing
hands
now
we
ve
had
one
grand
little
evening
and
i
ll
let
you
she
went
to
stand
by
the
door
he
arose
and
stood
by
her
all
this
nonsense
he
grumbled
i
i
won
t
stand
for
it
see
what
i
mean
very
masterfully
again
he
put
his
arms
about
her
say
he
demanded
are
you
afraid
of
me
like
you
said
you
d
always
been
afraid
of
men
yes
i
am
i
m
afraid
of
you
a
whole
lot
i
don
t
know
how
you
ll
take
take
what
oh
anything
anything
you
re
going
to
well
you
don
t
seem
to
be
afraid
of
i
am
more
than
any
well
sarah
you
needn
t
be
no
matter
what
you
ve
done
you
just
forget
it
and
give
me
a
good
big
i
m
glad
i
m
using
my
own
face
in
this
scene
murmured
sarah
down
at
the
corner
waiting
for
his
car
he
paced
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
bench
with
its
terse
message
you
furnish
the
girl
we
furnish
the
house
sarah
was
a
funny
little
thing
with
all
that
nonsense
about
what
he
would
find
out
little
he
cared
if
she
d
done
something
forgery
murder
anything
he
paused
in
his
stride
and
addressed
the
vacant
bench
well
i
ve
done
my
chapter
xviii
five
laughs
it
occurred
to
him
the
next
morning
that
he
might
have
taken
too
lightly
sarah
s
foreboding
of
illness
reviewing
her
curious
behaviour
he
thought
it
possible
she
might
be
in
for
something
serious
but
a
midday
telephone
call
at
the
montague
home
brought
assurances
from
the
mother
that
quieted
this
fear
sarah
complained
of
not
feeling
well
and
was
going
to
spend
a
quiet
day
at
home
but
montague
was
certain
it
was
nothing
serious
no
she
had
no
temperature
no
fever
at
all
she
was
just
having
a
spell
of
thinking
about
things
sort
of
grouchy
like
she
had
been
grouchy
to
both
her
parents
probably
because
she
wasn
t
working
no
she
said
she
wouldn
t
come
to
the
telephone
she
also
said
she
was
in
a
bad
way
and
might
pass
out
any
minute
but
that
was
just
her
kidding
it
was
kind
of
gill
to
call
up
he
wasn
t
to
worry
he
continued
to
worry
however
until
the
nearness
of
his
screen
debut
drove
sarah
to
the
back
of
his
mind
undoubtedly
it
was
just
her
nonsense
and
in
the
meantime
that
long
baffled
wish
to
see
himself
in
a
serious
drama
was
about
to
be
gratified
in
fullest
measure
he
was
glad
the
girl
had
not
suggested
that
she
be
with
him
on
this
tremendous
occasion
he
wanted
to
be
quite
alone
solitary
in
the
crowd
free
to
enjoy
his
own
acting
without
pretense
of
indifference
the
pattersons
of
course
were
another
matter
he
had
told
them
of
his
approaching
debut
and
they
were
making
an
event
of
it
they
would
attend
though
he
would
not
sit
with
them
patterson
in
his
black
suit
his
wife
in
society
raiment
would
sit
downstairs
and
would
doubtless
applaud
their
lodger
but
he
would
be
remote
from
them
in
a
far
corner
of
the
topmost
gallery
he
first
thought
for
hearts
on
fire
was
to
be
shown
in
one
of
the
big
theatres
where
a
prominent
member
of
its
cast
could
lose
himself
he
had
told
the
pattersons
a
little
about
the
story
it
was
pretty
pathetic
in
spots
he
said
but
it
all
came
right
in
the
end
and
there
were
some
good
western
scenes
when
the
pattersons
said
he
must
be
very
good
in
it
he
found
himself
unable
to
achieve
the
light
fashion
of
denial
and
protestation
that
would
have
become
him
he
said
he
had
struggled
to
give
the
world
something
better
and
finer
for
a
moment
he
was
moved
to
confess
that
patterson
in
the
course
of
his
struggles
had
come
close
to
losing
ten
dollars
but
he
mastered
the
wild
impulse
some
day
after
a
few
more
triumphs
he
might
laughingly
confide
this
to
her
the
day
was
long
slothfully
it
dragged
hours
that
seemed
endless
across
the
company
of
shining
dreams
that
he
captained
he
was
early
at
the
theatre
first
of
early
comers
and
entered
quickly
foregoing
even
a
look
at
the
huge
lithographs
in
front
that
would
perhaps
show
his
very
self
in
some
gripping
scene
with
an
empty
auditorium
to
choose
from
he
compromised
on
a
balcony
seat
down
below
would
doubtless
be
other
members
of
the
company
probably
baird
himself
and
he
did
not
wish
to
be
recognized
he
must
be
alone
with
his
triumph
and
the
loftier
gallery
would
be
too
far
away
the
house
filled
slowly
people
sauntered
to
their
seats
as
if
the
occasion
were
ordinary
even
when
the
seats
were
occupied
and
the
orchestra
had
played
there
ensued
the
annoying
delays
of
an
educational
film
and
a
travelogue
upon
this
young
actor
s
memory
would
be
forever
seared
the
information
that
the
conger
eel
lays
fifteen
million
eggs
at
one
time
and
that
the
inhabitants
of
upper
burmah
have
quaint
native
pastimes
these
things
would
stay
with
him
but
they
were
unimportant
even
the
prodigal
fecundity
of
the
conger
eel
left
him
cold
he
gripped
the
arms
of
his
seat
when
the
cast
of
hearts
on
fire
was
flung
to
the
screen
he
caught
his
own
name
instantly
and
was
puzzled
clifford
armytage
by
someone
had
bungled
that
but
no
matter
then
at
once
he
was
seeing
that
first
scene
of
his
as
a
popular
screen
idol
he
breakfasted
in
his
apartment
served
by
a
valet
who
was
a
hero
worshipper
he
was
momentarily
disquieted
by
the
frank
adoration
of
the
man
in
this
part
while
acting
the
scene
he
remembered
now
that
he
had
not
always
been
able
to
observe
his
valet
there
were
moments
when
he
seemed
the
valet
was
laughed
at
the
watcher
s
sympathy
went
out
to
baird
who
must
be
seeing
his
serious
effort
taken
too
lightly
there
came
the
scene
where
he
looked
at
the
photograph
album
but
now
his
turning
of
the
pages
was
interspersed
with
of
the
portraits
he
regarded
so
admiringly
and
these
astonishingly
proved
to
be
enlarged
stills
of
clifford
armytage
the
art
studies
of
lowell
hardy
it
was
puzzling
on
the
screen
he
capably
beamed
the
fondest
admiration
almost
reverent
in
its
intensity
and
there
would
appear
the
still
of
merton
bidding
an
emotional
farewell
to
his
horse
the
very
novelty
of
it
held
him
for
a
moment
gashwiler
s
dexter
actually
on
the
screen
he
was
aroused
by
the
hearty
laughter
of
an
immense
audience
it
s
parmalee
announced
a
hoarse
neighbour
on
his
right
he
s
imitatin
harold
say
the
kid
s
clever
the
laughter
continued
during
the
album
scene
he
thought
of
baird
somewhere
in
that
audience
suffering
because
his
play
was
made
fun
of
he
wished
he
could
remind
him
that
scenes
were
to
follow
which
would
surely
not
be
taken
lightly
for
himself
he
was
feeling
that
at
least
his
strong
likeness
to
parmalee
had
been
instantly
admitted
they
were
laughing
as
the
montague
girl
had
laughed
that
first
morning
because
the
resemblance
was
so
striking
but
now
on
the
screen
after
the
actor
s
long
fond
look
at
himself
came
the
words
the
only
man
he
ever
laughter
again
the
watcher
felt
himself
grow
hot
had
baird
been
betrayed
by
one
of
his
staff
the
scene
with
the
letters
followed
clothes
baskets
of
letters
his
own
work
as
he
opened
a
few
from
the
top
was
all
that
he
could
have
wished
he
was
finely
harold
parmalee
and
again
the
hoarse
neighbour
whispered
ain
t
he
got
parmalee
dead
though
poor
silly
little
girls
the
screen
exclaimed
and
the
audience
became
noisy
undoubtedly
it
was
a
tribute
to
his
perfection
in
the
parmalee
manner
but
he
was
glad
that
now
there
would
come
acting
at
which
no
one
could
laugh
there
was
the
delicatessen
shop
the
earnest
young
cashier
and
his
poor
old
mother
who
mopped
he
saw
himself
embrace
her
and
murmur
words
of
encouragement
but
incredibly
there
were
giggles
from
the
audience
doubtless
from
base
souls
who
were
impervious
to
pathos
the
giggles
coalesced
to
a
general
laugh
when
the
poor
old
mother
again
mopping
on
the
floor
was
seen
to
say
i
hate
these
mopping
mothers
you
get
took
with
s
knee
in
the
first
again
he
was
seized
with
a
fear
that
one
of
baird
s
staff
had
been
clumsy
with
subtitles
his
eyes
flew
to
his
own
serious
face
when
the
silly
words
had
gone
the
drama
moved
indeed
the
action
of
the
shadows
was
swifter
than
he
supposed
it
would
be
the
dissolute
son
of
the
proprietor
came
on
to
dust
the
wares
and
to
elicit
a
laugh
when
he
performed
a
bit
of
business
that
had
escaped
merton
at
the
time
against
the
wire
screen
that
covered
the
largest
cheese
on
the
counter
he
placed
a
placard
dangerous
do
not
probably
baird
had
not
known
of
this
clowning
and
there
came
another
subtitle
that
would
dismay
baird
when
the
serious
young
bookkeeper
enacted
his
scene
with
the
proprietor
s
lovely
daughter
for
she
was
made
to
say
you
love
above
your
station
ours
is
street
you
get
off
at
he
was
beginning
to
feel
confused
a
sense
of
loss
of
panic
smote
him
his
own
part
was
the
intensely
serious
thing
he
had
played
but
in
some
subtle
way
even
that
was
being
made
funny
he
could
not
rush
to
embrace
his
old
mother
without
exciting
laughter
the
robbery
of
the
safe
was
effected
by
the
dissolute
son
the
father
broke
in
upon
the
love
scene
discovered
the
loss
of
his
money
and
accused
an
innocent
man
merton
felt
that
he
here
acted
superbly
his
long
look
at
the
girl
for
whom
he
was
making
the
supreme
sacrifice
brought
tears
to
his
own
eyes
but
still
the
witless
audience
snickered
unobserved
by
the
others
the
old
mother
now
told
her
son
the
whereabouts
of
the
stolen
money
and
he
saw
himself
secure
the
paper
sack
of
bills
from
the
he
detected
the
look
of
which
he
had
spoken
to
baird
then
he
read
his
own
incredible
speech
i
better
take
this
cool
million
it
might
get
that
poor
lad
into
trouble
again
the
piece
had
been
hurt
by
a
wrong
subtitle
but
perhaps
the
audience
laughed
because
it
was
accustomed
to
laugh
at
baird
s
productions
perhaps
it
had
not
realized
that
he
was
now
attempting
one
of
the
things
this
reasoning
was
refuted
as
he
watched
what
occurred
after
he
had
made
his
escape
his
flight
was
discovered
policemen
entered
a
rapid
search
behind
counters
ensued
in
the
course
of
this
the
wire
screen
over
the
biggest
cheese
was
knocked
off
the
counter
the
cheese
leaped
to
the
floor
and
the
searchers
including
the
policemen
fled
in
panic
through
the
front
door
the
montague
girl
the
last
to
escape
was
seen
to
announce
the
big
cheese
is
loose
it
s
eating
all
the
little
ones
a
band
of
intrepid
firemen
protected
by
masks
and
armed
with
axes
rushed
in
a
terrific
struggle
ensued
the
delicatessen
shop
was
wrecked
and
through
it
all
the
old
mother
continued
to
mop
the
floor
merton
gill
who
had
first
grown
hot
was
now
cold
icy
drops
were
on
his
chilled
brow
how
had
hearts
on
fire
gone
wrong
then
they
were
in
the
great
open
spaces
of
the
come
all
ye
dance
hall
there
was
the
young
actor
in
his
buck
benson
costume
protecting
his
mother
from
the
brutality
of
a
mexican
getting
his
man
later
by
firing
directly
into
a
mirror
baird
had
said
it
would
come
right
in
the
exposure
but
it
hadn
t
and
the
witless
cackled
he
saw
his
struggle
with
the
detective
with
a
real
thrill
he
saw
himself
bear
his
opponent
to
the
ground
then
hurl
him
high
and
far
into
the
air
to
be
impaled
upon
the
antlers
of
an
elk
s
head
suspended
back
of
the
bar
he
saw
himself
lightly
dust
his
sleeves
after
this
feat
and
turn
aside
with
the
words
that
s
one
lodge
he
can
then
followed
a
scene
he
had
not
been
allowed
to
witness
there
swung
marcel
the
detective
played
too
emphatically
by
the
man
an
antler
point
suspended
him
by
the
seat
of
his
trousers
he
hung
limply
a
moment
then
took
from
his
pocket
a
saw
with
which
he
reached
up
to
contrive
his
release
he
sawed
through
the
antler
and
fell
he
tried
to
stand
erect
but
appeared
to
find
this
impossible
a
subtitle
announced
he
had
put
a
permanent
wave
in
this
base
fooling
was
continuously
blown
upon
by
gales
of
stupid
laughter
but
not
yet
did
merton
gill
know
the
worst
the
merriment
persisted
through
his
most
affecting
bit
the
farewell
to
his
old
pal
outside
how
could
they
have
laughed
at
a
simple
bit
of
pathos
like
that
but
the
watching
detective
was
seen
to
weep
bitterly
look
a
him
doin
buck
benson
urged
the
hoarse
neighbour
gleefully
you
got
to
hand
it
to
that
kid
say
who
is
he
anyway
followed
the
thrilling
leap
from
a
window
to
the
back
of
the
waiting
pal
the
leap
began
thrillingly
but
not
only
was
it
shown
that
the
escaping
man
had
donned
a
coat
and
a
false
mustache
in
the
course
of
his
fall
but
at
its
end
he
was
revealed
slowly
very
slowly
clambering
into
the
saddle
they
had
used
here
he
saw
one
of
those
slow
cameras
that
seem
to
suspend
all
action
interminably
a
cruel
device
in
this
instance
and
for
his
actual
escape
when
he
had
ridden
the
horse
beyond
camera
range
at
a
safe
walk
they
had
used
another
camera
that
gave
the
effect
of
intense
speed
the
old
horse
had
walked
but
with
an
air
of
swiftness
that
caused
the
audience
intense
delight
entered
marcel
the
detective
in
another
scene
merton
had
not
watched
he
emerged
from
the
to
confront
a
horse
that
remained
an
aged
counterpart
of
the
horse
merton
had
ridden
off
marcel
stared
intently
into
the
beast
s
face
whereupon
it
reared
and
plunged
as
if
terrified
by
the
spectacle
of
the
man
merton
recalled
the
horse
in
the
village
that
had
seemed
to
act
so
intelligently
probably
a
had
stimulated
the
present
scene
the
detective
thereupon
turned
aside
hastily
donned
his
false
mustache
and
sherlock
holmes
cap
and
the
deceived
horse
now
permitted
him
to
mount
he
too
walked
off
to
the
necromancy
of
a
lens
that
multiplied
his
pace
a
thousandfold
and
the
audience
rocked
in
its
seats
one
horse
still
remained
before
the
the
old
mother
emerged
with
one
anguished
look
after
the
detective
she
gathered
up
her
disreputable
skirts
and
left
the
platform
in
a
flying
leap
to
land
in
the
saddle
there
was
no
trickery
about
the
speed
at
which
her
horse
belaboured
with
the
galloped
in
pursuit
of
the
others
a
subtitle
recited
she
has
watched
her
dear
ones
leave
the
old
nest
flat
now
she
must
go
out
over
the
hills
and
mop
the
other
side
of
them
now
came
the
sensational
capture
by
lasso
of
the
detective
but
the
captor
had
not
known
that
as
he
dragged
his
quarry
at
the
rope
s
end
the
latter
had
somehow
possessed
himself
of
a
sign
which
he
later
walked
in
with
a
sign
reading
join
the
good
roads
movement
nor
that
the
faithful
old
mother
had
ridden
up
to
deposit
her
inverted
over
his
head
merton
gill
had
twice
started
to
leave
he
wanted
to
leave
but
each
time
he
found
himself
chained
there
by
the
evil
fascination
of
this
monstrous
parody
he
remained
to
learn
that
the
montague
girl
had
come
out
to
the
great
open
spaces
to
lead
a
band
of
from
the
he
saw
her
ride
beside
a
train
and
cast
her
lasso
over
the
stack
of
the
locomotive
he
saw
her
pony
settle
back
on
its
haunches
while
the
rope
grew
taut
and
the
train
was
forced
to
a
halt
he
saw
the
passengers
lined
up
by
the
wayside
and
forced
to
part
with
their
valuables
later
when
the
band
returned
to
the
ranche
with
their
booty
he
saw
the
dissolute
brother
after
the
treasure
was
divided
winning
it
back
to
the
family
coffers
with
his
dice
he
saw
the
stricken
father
playing
golf
on
his
bicycle
in
grotesque
imitation
of
a
polo
player
and
still
so
incredible
the
revealment
he
had
not
in
the
first
shock
of
it
seemed
to
consider
baird
in
any
way
to
blame
baird
had
somehow
been
deceived
by
his
actors
yet
a
startling
suspicion
was
forming
amid
his
mental
flurries
a
suspicion
that
bloomed
to
certainty
when
he
saw
himself
the
victim
of
the
genuine
hidalgo
spurs
baird
had
said
he
wanted
the
merely
for
use
in
determining
how
the
spurs
could
be
mastered
yet
here
they
were
merton
gill
caught
the
spurs
in
undergrowth
and
caught
them
in
his
own
chaps
arising
from
each
fall
with
a
look
of
gentle
determination
that
appealed
strongly
to
the
throng
of
lackwits
they
shrieked
at
each
of
his
failures
even
when
he
ran
to
greet
his
pictured
sweetheart
and
fell
headlong
they
found
the
comedy
almost
unbearable
when
at
baird
s
direction
he
had
begun
to
toe
in
as
he
walked
and
he
had
fallen
clumsily
again
when
he
flew
to
that
last
glad
rendezvous
where
the
pair
were
irised
out
in
a
love
triumphant
while
the
old
mother
mopped
a
large
rock
in
the
background
an
intervening
of
this
rock
revealed
her
tearful
face
as
she
cleansed
the
granite
surface
above
her
loomed
a
painted
exhortation
to
use
wizard
spine
and
of
this
pathetic
old
creature
he
was
made
to
say
even
as
he
clasped
the
beloved
in
his
arms
remember
she
is
my
mother
i
will
not
desert
her
now
just
because
i
am
rich
and
grand
at
last
he
was
free
amid
applause
that
was
long
and
sincere
he
gained
his
feet
and
pushed
a
way
out
his
hoarse
neighbour
was
saying
who
is
the
kid
anyway
ain
t
he
a
wonder
he
pulled
his
hat
down
dreading
he
might
be
recognized
and
shamed
before
these
shallow
fools
he
froze
with
the
horror
of
what
he
had
been
unable
to
look
away
from
the
ignominy
of
it
and
now
after
those
spurs
he
knew
full
well
that
baird
had
betrayed
him
as
the
words
shaped
in
his
mind
a
monstrous
echo
of
them
reverberated
through
its
caverns
the
montague
girl
had
betrayed
him
he
understood
her
now
and
burned
with
memories
of
her
uneasiness
the
night
before
she
had
been
suffering
acutely
from
remorse
she
had
sought
to
cover
it
with
pleas
of
physical
illness
at
the
moment
he
was
conscious
of
no
feeling
toward
her
save
wonder
that
she
could
so
coolly
have
played
him
false
but
the
thing
was
not
to
be
questioned
she
and
baird
had
made
a
fool
of
him
as
he
left
the
theatre
the
crowd
about
him
commented
approvingly
on
the
picture
who
s
this
new
comedian
he
heard
a
voice
inquire
but
ain
t
he
a
wonder
seemed
to
be
the
sole
reply
he
flushed
darkly
so
they
thought
him
a
comedian
well
baird
wouldn
t
think
so
not
after
he
paused
outside
the
theatre
now
to
study
the
lithograph
in
colours
there
he
hurled
marcel
to
the
antlers
of
the
elk
the
announcement
was
hearts
on
fire
a
jeff
baird
comedy
five
baird
he
sneeringly
reflected
had
kept
faith
with
his
patrons
if
not
with
one
of
his
actors
but
how
he
had
profaned
the
sunlit
glories
of
the
great
open
west
and
its
virile
drama
and
the
spurs
as
he
had
promised
the
unsuspecting
wearer
had
stood
out
the
horror
of
it
blinding
desolating
and
he
had
as
good
as
stolen
that
money
himself
taking
it
out
to
the
great
open
spaces
to
spend
in
a
baird
s
serious
effort
had
turned
out
to
be
a
wild
inconsequent
farrago
of
the
most
painful
nonsense
but
it
was
over
for
merton
gill
the
golden
bowl
was
broken
the
silver
cord
was
loosed
he
would
tear
up
baird
s
contract
and
hurl
the
pieces
in
baird
s
face
as
to
the
montague
girl
that
deceiving
jade
was
hopeless
never
again
could
he
trust
her
in
a
whirling
daze
of
resentment
he
boarded
a
car
for
the
journey
home
a
group
seated
near
him
still
laughed
about
hearts
on
fire
i
thought
he
d
kill
me
with
those
spurs
declared
an
otherwise
sanely
behaving
young
woman
that
hurt
embarrassed
look
on
his
face
every
time
he
d
get
up
he
cowered
in
his
seat
and
he
remembered
another
ordeal
he
must
probably
face
when
he
reached
home
he
hoped
the
pattersons
would
be
in
bed
and
walked
up
and
down
before
the
gate
when
he
saw
the
house
still
alight
but
the
light
stayed
and
at
last
he
nerved
himself
for
a
possible
encounter
he
let
himself
in
softly
still
hoping
he
could
gain
his
room
undiscovered
but
patterson
framed
herself
in
the
lighted
door
of
the
living
room
and
became
exclamatory
at
sight
of
him
and
he
who
had
thought
to
stand
before
these
people
in
shame
to
receive
their
condolences
now
perceived
that
his
trial
would
be
of
another
but
hardly
sort
for
somehow
so
dense
were
these
good
folks
that
he
must
seem
to
be
not
displeased
with
his
own
performance
amazingly
they
congratulated
him
struggling
with
reminiscent
laughter
as
they
did
so
and
you
never
told
us
you
was
one
of
them
funny
comedians
chided
patterson
we
thought
you
was
just
a
beginner
and
here
you
got
the
biggest
part
in
the
picture
say
the
way
you
acted
when
you
d
pick
yourself
up
after
them
spurs
threw
you
i
ll
wake
up
in
the
night
laughing
at
and
the
way
he
kept
his
face
so
straight
when
them
other
funny
ones
was
cutting
their
capers
all
around
him
observed
patterson
yes
wasn
t
it
wonderful
jed
the
way
he
never
let
on
keeping
his
face
as
serious
as
if
he
d
been
in
a
serious
play
i
like
to
fell
off
my
seat
added
patterson
i
ll
tell
you
something
armytage
began
patterson
with
a
suddenly
serious
manner
of
her
own
i
never
been
one
to
flatter
folks
to
their
faces
unless
i
felt
it
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
never
been
that
kind
when
i
tell
a
person
about
themselves
they
can
take
it
for
the
truth
s
own
truth
so
you
can
believe
me
now
i
saw
lots
of
times
in
that
play
when
you
was
even
funnier
than
the
the
young
actor
was
regarding
her
strangely
seemingly
he
wished
to
acknowledge
this
compliment
but
could
find
no
suitable
words
yes
you
can
blush
and
hem
and
haw
went
on
his
critic
but
any
one
knows
me
i
ll
tell
you
i
mean
it
when
i
talk
that
way
yes
sir
funnier
than
the
man
himself
my
i
guess
the
neighbours
ll
be
talking
soon
s
they
find
out
we
got
someone
as
important
as
you
be
in
our
and
armytage
i
want
you
to
give
me
a
signed
photograph
of
yourself
if
you
ll
be
so
he
escaped
at
last
dizzy
from
the
maelstrom
of
conflicting
emotions
that
had
caught
and
whirled
him
it
had
been
impossible
not
to
appear
and
somehow
difficult
not
to
feel
gratified
under
this
heartfelt
praise
he
had
been
bound
to
appear
pleased
but
incredulous
even
when
she
pronounced
him
superior
at
times
to
the
man
though
the
word
she
used
was
betrayed
by
his
friends
stricken
disconsolate
in
a
panic
of
despair
he
had
yet
seemed
glad
to
hear
that
he
had
been
he
flew
to
the
sanctity
of
his
room
not
again
could
he
bear
to
be
told
that
the
acting
which
had
been
his
soul
s
high
vision
was
a
thing
for
merriment
he
paced
his
room
a
long
time
a
restless
defenceless
victim
to
recurrent
visions
of
his
shame
implacably
they
returned
to
torture
him
reel
after
reel
of
the
ignoble
stuff
spawned
by
the
miscreant
baird
flashed
before
him
a
world
of
base
painted
shadows
in
which
he
had
been
the
arch
offender
again
and
again
he
tried
to
make
clear
to
himself
just
why
his
own
acting
should
have
caused
mirth
surely
he
had
been
serious
he
had
given
the
best
that
was
in
him
and
the
groundlings
had
guffawed
perhaps
it
was
a
puzzle
he
could
never
solve
and
now
he
first
thought
of
the
new
piece
this
threw
him
into
fresh
panic
what
awful
things
with
his
high
and
serious
acting
would
he
have
been
made
to
do
in
that
patiently
one
by
one
he
went
over
the
scenes
in
which
he
had
appeared
dazed
confused
his
recollection
could
bring
to
him
little
that
was
ambiguous
in
them
but
also
he
had
played
through
hearts
on
fire
with
little
suspicion
of
its
low
intentions
he
went
to
bed
at
last
though
to
toss
another
hour
in
fruitless
effort
to
solve
this
puzzle
and
to
free
his
eyes
of
those
flashing
infamies
of
the
night
ever
and
again
as
he
seemed
to
become
composed
free
at
last
of
tormenting
visions
a
mere
subtitle
would
flash
in
his
brain
as
where
the
old
mother
when
he
first
punished
her
insulter
was
made
by
the
screen
to
call
out
kick
him
on
the
too
but
the
darkness
refreshed
his
tired
eyes
and
sun
at
last
brought
him
a
merciful
outlet
from
a
world
in
which
you
could
act
your
best
and
still
be
funnier
than
a
man
he
awakened
long
past
his
usual
hour
and
occupied
his
first
conscious
moments
in
convincing
himself
that
the
scandal
of
the
night
before
had
not
been
a
bad
dream
the
shock
was
a
little
dulled
now
he
began
absurdly
to
remember
the
comments
of
those
who
had
appeared
to
enjoy
the
unworthy
entertainment
undoubtedly
many
people
had
mentioned
him
with
warm
approval
but
such
praise
was
surely
nothing
to
take
comfort
from
he
was
aroused
from
this
retrospection
by
a
knock
on
his
door
it
proved
to
be
patterson
bearing
a
tray
mrs
thought
that
you
being
up
so
late
last
night
mebbe
would
like
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
bite
of
something
before
you
went
the
man
s
manner
was
newly
respectful
in
this
house
at
least
merton
gill
was
still
someone
he
thanked
his
host
and
consumed
the
coffee
and
toast
with
a
novel
sense
of
importance
the
courtesy
was
unprecedented
patterson
had
indeed
been
sincere
and
scarcely
had
he
finished
dressing
when
patterson
was
again
at
the
door
a
gentleman
downstairs
to
see
you
armytage
he
says
his
name
is
walberg
but
you
don
t
know
him
he
says
it
s
a
business
very
well
i
ll
be
a
business
matter
he
had
no
business
matters
with
any
one
except
baird
he
was
smitten
with
a
quick
and
quite
illogical
fear
perhaps
he
would
not
have
to
tear
up
that
contract
and
hurl
it
in
the
face
of
the
manager
who
had
betrayed
him
perhaps
the
manager
himself
would
do
the
tearing
perhaps
baird
after
seeing
the
picture
had
decided
that
merton
gill
would
not
do
instantly
he
felt
resentful
hadn
t
he
given
the
best
that
was
in
him
was
it
his
fault
if
other
actors
had
turned
into
farce
one
of
the
things
he
went
to
meet
walberg
with
this
resentment
so
warm
that
his
greeting
of
the
strange
gentleman
was
gruff
and
short
the
caller
an
alert
businesslike
man
came
at
once
to
his
point
he
was
it
proved
not
the
representative
of
a
possibly
repenting
baird
he
was
on
the
contrary
representing
a
rival
producer
he
extended
his
card
the
bigart
comedies
i
got
your
address
from
the
holden
office
armytage
i
guess
i
routed
you
out
of
bed
eh
well
it
s
like
this
if
you
ain
t
sewed
up
with
baird
yet
the
bigart
people
would
like
to
talk
a
little
business
to
you
how
about
it
business
armytage
fairly
exploded
this
he
was
unhappy
and
puzzled
in
consequence
unamiable
sure
business
confirmed
walberg
i
understand
you
just
finished
another
for
the
buckeye
outfit
but
how
about
some
stuff
for
us
now
we
can
give
you
as
good
a
company
as
that
one
last
night
and
a
good
line
of
comedy
we
got
a
gag
man
that
simply
never
gets
to
the
end
of
his
string
he
s
doping
out
something
right
now
that
would
fit
you
like
a
glove
and
say
it
would
be
a
great
idea
to
kind
a
specialize
in
that
spur
act
of
yours
that
got
over
big
we
could
work
it
in
again
an
act
like
that
s
good
for
a
million
armytage
eyed
walberg
coldly
even
walberg
felt
an
extensive
area
of
glaciation
setting
in
i
wouldn
t
think
of
it
said
the
actor
still
gruffly
do
you
mean
that
you
can
t
come
to
the
bigart
at
all
on
any
proposition
that
s
what
i
mean
confirmed
armytage
would
three
hundred
and
fifty
a
week
interest
you
no
said
armytage
though
he
gulped
twice
before
achieving
it
walberg
reported
to
his
people
that
this
armytage
lad
was
one
proposition
he
d
seen
lots
of
em
in
his
time
but
this
bird
was
a
wonder
yet
armytage
was
not
really
so
granitic
of
nature
as
the
bigart
emissary
had
thought
him
he
had
begun
the
interview
with
a
smouldering
resentment
due
to
a
misapprehension
he
had
been
outraged
by
a
suggestion
that
the
spurs
be
again
put
to
their
offensive
use
and
he
had
been
stunned
by
an
offer
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
week
that
was
all
here
was
a
new
angle
to
the
puzzles
that
distracted
him
he
was
not
only
praised
by
the
witless
but
he
had
been
found
desirable
by
certain
discerning
overlords
of
filmdom
what
could
be
the
secret
of
a
talent
that
caused
people
after
viewing
it
but
once
to
make
reckless
offers
and
another
thing
why
had
he
allowed
baird
to
sew
him
up
the
montague
girl
again
occupied
the
foreground
of
his
troubled
musings
she
with
her
airs
of
wise
importance
had
helped
to
sew
him
up
she
was
a
helpless
thing
after
all
and
false
of
nature
he
would
have
matters
out
with
her
this
very
day
but
first
he
must
confront
baird
in
a
scene
of
scorn
and
reprobation
on
the
car
he
became
aware
that
far
back
in
remote
caverns
of
his
mind
there
ran
a
teasing
memory
of
some
book
on
the
shelves
of
the
simsbury
public
library
he
was
sure
it
was
not
a
book
he
had
read
it
was
merely
the
title
that
hid
itself
only
this
had
ever
interested
him
and
it
but
momentarily
so
much
he
knew
a
book
s
title
had
lodged
in
his
mind
remained
there
and
was
now
curiously
stirring
in
some
direct
relation
to
his
present
perplexities
but
it
kept
its
face
averted
he
could
not
read
it
vaguely
he
identified
the
nameless
book
with
tessie
kearns
he
could
not
divine
how
because
it
was
not
her
book
and
he
had
never
seen
it
except
on
the
library
shelf
the
nameless
book
persistently
danced
before
him
he
was
glad
of
this
it
kept
him
at
moments
from
thinking
of
the
loathly
baird
chapter
xix
the
tragic
comedian
penetrating
the
holden
lot
he
was
relieved
to
find
that
he
created
no
immediate
sensation
people
did
not
halt
to
point
derisive
fingers
at
him
he
had
half
feared
they
would
as
he
approached
the
office
building
he
was
almost
certain
he
saw
baird
turn
in
ahead
of
him
yet
when
he
entered
the
outer
room
of
the
buckeye
offices
a
young
woman
looked
up
from
her
typewriter
to
tell
him
that
baird
was
not
in
she
was
a
young
woman
of
a
sincere
manner
she
spoke
with
certainty
of
tone
baird
was
not
only
out
but
he
would
not
be
in
for
several
days
his
physician
had
ordered
him
to
a
sanitarium
the
young
woman
resumed
her
typing
she
did
not
again
glance
up
the
caller
seemed
to
consider
waiting
on
a
chance
that
she
had
been
misinformed
he
was
now
sure
he
had
seen
baird
enter
the
building
and
the
door
of
his
private
office
was
closed
the
caller
idled
outside
the
railing
absently
regarding
stills
of
past
buckeye
atrocities
that
had
been
hung
upon
the
walls
of
the
office
by
someone
with
primitive
tastes
in
decoration
he
was
debating
a
direct
challenge
of
the
young
woman
s
veracity
what
would
she
say
if
told
that
the
caller
meant
to
wait
right
there
until
baird
should
convalesce
he
managed
some
appraising
at
her
as
she
bent
over
her
machine
she
seemed
to
believe
he
had
already
gone
then
he
did
go
no
good
talking
that
way
to
a
girl
if
it
had
been
a
man
now
you
tell
baird
that
gill
s
got
to
see
him
as
soon
as
possible
about
something
important
he
directed
from
the
open
door
the
young
woman
raised
her
serious
eyes
to
his
and
nodded
she
resumed
her
work
the
door
closed
upon
its
closing
the
door
of
baird
s
private
office
opened
noiselessly
to
a
crack
that
sufficed
for
the
speaking
voice
at
very
moderate
pitch
to
issue
get
miss
montague
on
the
phone
directed
the
voice
the
door
closed
noiselessly
beyond
it
baird
was
presently
speaking
in
low
sweet
tones
lo
sister
listen
that
squirrel
just
boiled
in
here
and
i
ducked
him
i
told
the
girl
i
wasn
t
to
be
in
unless
he
was
laughing
all
over
and
he
wasn
t
doing
the
least
little
thing
that
was
anywheres
near
laughing
see
what
i
mean
it
s
up
to
you
now
you
started
it
you
got
to
finish
it
i
ve
irised
out
get
me
on
the
steps
outside
the
rebuffed
merton
gill
glanced
at
his
own
natty
bought
with
some
of
the
later
wages
of
his
shame
it
was
the
luncheon
hour
mechanically
he
made
his
way
to
the
cafeteria
he
had
ceased
to
rehearse
the
speech
a
doughtier
baird
would
now
have
been
hearing
instead
he
roughly
drafted
one
that
sarah
nevada
montague
could
not
long
evade
even
on
her
dying
bed
she
would
be
compelled
to
listen
the
practising
orator
with
bent
head
mumbled
as
he
walked
he
still
mumbled
as
he
indicated
a
choice
of
foods
at
the
cafeteria
counter
he
continued
to
be
thus
absorbed
as
he
found
a
table
near
the
centre
of
the
room
he
arranged
his
assortment
of
viands
you
led
me
on
that
s
what
you
did
he
continued
to
the
absent
culprit
led
me
on
to
make
a
of
myself
that
s
what
you
did
made
a
fool
of
me
that
s
what
you
all
the
same
i
can
t
help
thinking
he
s
a
harm
to
the
industry
came
the
crisp
tones
of
henshaw
from
an
adjoining
table
the
rehearsing
orator
glanced
up
to
discover
that
the
director
and
the
brown
and
gray
man
he
called
governor
were
smoking
above
the
plates
of
their
finished
luncheon
i
wouldn
t
worry
too
much
suggested
the
cheerful
governor
but
see
what
he
does
he
takes
the
good
old
reliable
stuff
and
makes
fun
of
it
i
admit
it
s
funny
to
start
with
but
what
ll
happen
to
us
if
the
picture
public
ever
finds
that
out
what
ll
we
do
then
for
drama
after
they
ve
learned
to
laugh
at
the
old
stuff
tush
tush
my
boy
the
governor
waved
a
half
consumed
cigarette
until
its
ash
fell
never
fear
do
you
think
a
thousand
jeff
bairds
could
make
the
picture
public
laugh
at
the
old
stuff
when
it
s
played
straight
they
laughed
last
night
yes
but
not
so
much
at
the
really
fine
burlesque
they
guffawed
at
the
stuff
that
went
with
it
baird
s
shrewd
he
knows
if
he
played
straight
burlesque
he
d
never
make
a
dollar
so
notice
how
he
ll
give
a
bit
of
straight
that
is
genuine
art
then
a
bit
of
that
any
one
can
get
the
is
what
carries
the
show
real
burlesque
is
criticism
my
boy
sometimes
the
very
sort
it
demands
sophistication
a
pretty
high
intelligence
in
the
man
that
gets
it
all
right
now
take
your
picture
public
twenty
million
people
every
day
not
the
same
ones
every
day
but
with
same
average
cranial
index
which
is
low
for
all
but
about
seven
out
of
every
hundred
that
s
natural
because
there
aren
t
twenty
million
people
in
the
world
with
taste
or
real
intelligence
probably
not
five
million
well
you
take
this
twenty
million
bunch
that
we
sell
to
every
day
and
suppose
they
saw
that
lovely
thing
last
night
don
t
you
know
they
d
all
be
back
to
see
a
real
mopping
mother
with
a
real
son
falsely
accused
of
crime
sure
they
d
be
back
their
heads
bloody
but
unbowed
don
t
worry
that
reliable
field
marshal
old
general
hokum
leads
an
unbeatable
merton
gill
had
listened
to
the
beginning
of
this
harangue
but
now
he
savagely
devoured
food
he
thought
this
so
called
governor
was
too
much
like
baird
well
governor
i
hope
you
re
right
but
that
was
pretty
keen
stuff
last
night
that
first
bit
won
t
do
parmalee
any
good
and
that
buck
benson
stuff
you
can
t
tell
me
a
little
more
of
that
wouldn
t
make
benson
look
around
for
a
new
but
i
do
tell
you
just
that
it
won
t
hurt
parmalee
a
bit
and
benson
can
go
on
bensoning
to
the
end
of
time
to
big
money
you
keep
forgetting
this
audience
go
out
and
buy
a
picture
magazine
and
read
it
through
just
to
remind
you
they
want
hokum
and
pay
for
it
even
this
thing
of
baird
s
with
all
the
saving
slapstick
is
over
the
heads
of
a
good
half
of
them
i
ll
make
a
bet
with
you
now
anything
you
name
that
it
won
t
gross
two
thirds
as
much
as
benson
s
next
western
and
in
that
they
ll
cry
their
eyes
out
when
he
kisses
his
horse
see
if
they
don
t
or
see
if
they
don
t
bawl
at
the
next
old
mother
with
a
mop
and
a
son
that
gets
in
bad
why
if
you
give
em
hokum
they
don
t
even
demand
acting
look
at
our
own
star
mercer
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
she
not
only
can
t
act
but
she
s
merely
a
beautiful
moron
in
a
world
where
right
prevailed
she
d
be
crowned
queen
of
the
morons
without
question
she
may
have
an
idea
that
two
and
two
make
four
but
if
she
has
it
s
only
because
she
believes
everything
she
hears
and
look
at
the
mail
she
gets
every
last
one
of
the
twenty
million
has
written
to
tell
her
what
a
noble
actress
she
is
she
even
believes
that
baird
can
keep
on
with
the
burlesque
stuff
but
his
little
old
ll
probably
have
to
pay
for
it
especially
if
he
keeps
those
people
i
ll
bet
that
one
new
man
of
his
sets
him
back
seven
hundred
and
fifty
a
week
the
lord
knows
he
s
worth
every
cent
of
it
my
boy
tell
me
did
you
ever
in
all
your
life
see
a
lovelier
imitation
of
a
perfectly
rotten
actor
there
s
an
artist
for
you
who
is
he
anyway
where
d
he
come
from
merton
gill
again
listened
he
was
merely
affecting
to
busy
himself
with
a
fork
it
was
good
acting
i
don
t
know
replied
henshaw
some
of
the
crowd
last
night
said
he
was
just
an
extra
that
baird
dug
up
on
the
lot
here
and
on
the
subject
of
burlesque
they
also
said
baird
was
having
him
do
some
edgar
wayne
stuff
in
a
new
fine
the
governor
beamed
can
t
you
see
him
as
the
honest
likable
country
boy
i
bet
he
ll
be
good
to
his
old
mother
in
this
one
too
and
get
the
best
of
the
city
slickers
in
the
end
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
let
me
miss
it
this
kid
last
night
handed
me
laughs
that
were
better
than
a
month
s
vacation
for
this
old
carcass
of
mine
you
say
he
was
just
an
extra
that
s
what
i
heard
last
night
anyway
he
s
all
you
say
he
is
as
an
artist
where
do
you
suppose
he
got
it
do
you
suppose
he
s
just
the
casual
genius
that
comes
along
from
time
to
time
and
why
didn
t
he
stay
straight
instead
of
playing
horse
with
the
sacred
traditions
of
our
art
that
s
what
troubled
me
as
i
watched
him
even
in
that
wild
business
with
the
spurs
he
was
the
artist
every
second
he
must
have
tricked
those
falls
but
i
couldn
t
catch
him
at
it
why
should
such
a
man
tie
up
with
baird
ask
me
something
hard
i
d
say
this
bird
had
been
tried
out
in
serious
stuff
and
couldn
t
make
the
grade
that
s
the
way
he
struck
me
probably
he
once
thought
he
could
play
hamlet
one
of
those
boys
didn
t
you
get
the
real
pathos
he
d
turn
on
now
and
then
he
actually
had
me
kind
of
teary
a
couple
of
times
but
i
could
see
he
d
also
make
me
laugh
my
head
off
any
time
he
showed
in
a
straight
piece
to
begin
with
look
at
that
face
of
his
and
then
something
peculiar
even
while
he
s
imitating
a
bad
actor
you
feel
somehow
that
it
isn
t
all
imitation
it
s
art
i
grant
you
but
you
feel
he
d
still
be
a
bad
actor
if
he
d
try
to
imitate
a
good
one
somehow
he
found
out
his
limits
and
decided
to
be
what
god
meant
him
to
be
does
that
answer
you
it
gives
you
and
if
that
isn
t
the
plus
in
this
case
i
miss
my
i
suppose
you
re
right
something
like
that
and
of
course
the
real
pathos
is
there
it
has
to
be
there
never
was
a
great
comedian
without
it
and
this
one
is
great
i
admit
that
and
i
admit
all
you
say
about
our
audience
i
suppose
we
can
t
ever
sell
to
twenty
million
people
a
day
pictures
that
make
any
demand
on
the
human
intelligence
but
couldn
t
we
sell
something
better
to
one
million
or
a
few
thousand
the
governor
dropped
his
cigarette
end
into
the
dregs
of
his
coffee
we
might
he
said
if
we
were
endowed
as
it
is
to
make
pictures
we
must
make
money
to
make
money
we
must
sell
to
the
mob
and
the
mob
reaches
full
mental
bloom
at
the
age
of
fifteen
it
won
t
buy
pictures
the
average
child
can
t
of
course
the
art
is
in
its
infancy

henshaw

his
own
cigarette
ours

announced
the
governor
as
he
rose
the
peter

of
the
arts
yes
i
trust
you
recall
the
outstanding
biological
freakishness
of
oh
replied
henshaw
when
merton
gill
dared
to
glance
up
a
moment
later
the
men
were
matching
coins
at
the
counter
when
they
went
out
he
left
a
meal
and
presently
might
have
been
observed
on
a
he
mumbled
as
he
blankly
surveyed
building
sites
along
the
way
he
was
again
rehearsing
a
tense
scene
with
the
montague
girl
in
actor
parlance
he
was
giving
himself
all
the
best
of
it
but
they
were
new
lines
he
mumbled
over
and
over
and
he
was
no
longer
eluded
by
the
title
of
that
book
he
remembered
on
the
library
shelf
at
simsbury
sitting
in
the
cafeteria
listening
to
strange
talk
lashed
by
cruel
memories
it
had
flashed
upon
his
vision
with
the
stark
definition
of
a
screened
subtitle
he
rang
the
montague
bell
twice
before
he
heard
a
faint
summons
to
enter
upon
the
parlour
couch
under
blankets
that
reached
her
pillowed
head
lay
sarah
she
was
pale
and
seemed
to
suffer
she
greeted
him
in
a
feeble
voice
lids
fluttering
over
the
fires
of
that
mysterious
fever
burning
far
back
in
her
eyes
hullo
kid
he
began
brightly
here
s
your
her
doubting
glance
hovered
over
him
as
he
smiled
down
at
her
you
giving
it
to
me
again
merton
she
seemed
unable
to
conquer
a
stubborn
incredulity
of
course
i
m
giving
it
to
you
again
what
d
you
think
i
was
going
to
do
she
still
surveyed
him
with
little
veiled
glances
you
look
so
bright
you
give
me
kleig
eyes
she
said
she
managed
a
wan
smile
at
this
take
it
he
insisted
extending
the
package
of
course
it
won
t
keep
western
union
time
but
it
ll
look
good
on
she
appeared
to
be
gaining
on
her
incredulity
but
a
vestige
of
it
remained
i
won
t
touch
it
she
declared
with
more
spirit
than
could
have
been
expected
from
the
perishing
i
won
t
touch
it
till
you
give
me
a
good
big
sure
he
said
and
leaned
down
to
brush
her
pale
cheek
with
his
lips
he
was
cheerfully
businesslike
in
this
ceremony
not
till
you
do
it
right
she
persisted
he
knelt
beside
the
couch
and
did
it
right
he
lingered
with
a
hand
upon
her
pale
brow
what
you
afraid
of
he
demanded
you
she
said
but
now
she
again
brought
the
watch
to
view
holding
it
away
from
her
studying
its
glitter
from
various
angles
at
last
she
turned
her
eyes
up
to
his
they
were
alive
but
unrevealing
well
well
he
repeated
coolly
oh
stop
it
again
there
was
more
energy
than
the
moribund
are
wont
to
manifest
there
was
even
a
vigorous
impatience
in
her
tone
as
she
went
on
you
know
well
enough
what
i
was
afraid
of
and
you
know
well
enough
what
i
want
to
hear
right
now
shoot
can
t
you
he
shot
he
stood
up
backed
away
from
the
couch
to
where
he
could
conveniently
regard
its
stricken
occupant
and
shot
gaily
well
it
ll
be
a
good
lesson
to
you
about
me
this
thing
of
your
thinking
i
was
fooled
over
that
piece
i
s
pose
you
and
baird
had
it
between
you
all
the
time
right
down
to
the
very
last
that
i
thought
he
was
doin
a
serious
play
ho
ho
he
laughed
gibingly
it
was
a
masterful
laugh
a
serious
play
with
a
man
doing
funny
stuff
all
through
i
thought
it
was
serious
did
i
yes
i
did
again
the
dry
scornful
laugh
of
superiority
didn
t
you
people
know
that
i
knew
what
i
could
do
and
what
i
couldn
t
do
i
should
have
thought
that
little
thing
would
of
occurred
to
you
all
the
time
didn
t
you
s
pose
i
knew
as
well
as
any
one
that
i
got
a
face
and
couldn
t
ever
make
the
grade
in
a
serious
piece
of
course
i
know
i
got
real
pathos
look
how
i
turned
it
on
a
couple
o
times
in
that
piece
last
night
but
even
when
i
m
imitating
a
bad
actor
you
can
see
it
ain
t
all
acting
you
d
see
soon
enough
i
was
a
bad
actor
if
i
tried
to
imitate
a
good
one
i
guess
you
d
see
that
pretty
quick
didn
t
you
and
baird
even
s
pose
i
d
found
out
my
limits
and
decided
to
be
what
god
meant
me
to
be
but
i
got
the
pathos
all
right
and
you
can
t
name
one
great
comedian
that
don
t
need
pathos
more
n
he
needs
anything
else
he
just
has
to
have
it
and
i
got
it
i
got
that
s
what
i
got
i
knew
it
all
the
time
and
a
whole
lot
of
other
people
knew
it
last
night
you
could
hear
fifty
of
em
talking
about
it
when
i
came
out
of
the
theatre
saying
i
was
an
artist
and
all
like
that
and
a
certain
los
angeles
society
woman
that
you
can
bet
never
says
things
she
don
t
mean
she
told
me
she
saw
lots
of
places
in
this
piece
that
i
was
funnier
than
any
man
that
ever
lived
and
what
happens
this
morning
hands
in
pockets
he
swaggered
to
and
fro
past
the
couch
well
nothing
happens
this
morning
except
people
coming
around
to
sign
me
up
for
three
hundred
and
fifty
a
week
one
of
em
said
not
an
hour
ago
he
s
a
big
producer
too
that
baird
ought
to
be
paying
me
seven
hundred
and
fifty
because
i
earned
every
cent
of
it
of
course
i
didn
t
want
to
say
anything
the
other
day
with
you
pretending
to
know
so
much
about
contracts
and
all
that
i
just
thought
i
d
let
you
go
on
seeing
you
were
so
smart
and
i
signed
what
you
told
me
to
but
i
know
i
should
have
held
off
with
this
bamberger
coming
over
from
the
bigart
when
i
was
hardly
out
of
bed
and
says
will
three
hundred
and
fifty
a
week
interest
me
and
promising
he
ll
give
me
a
chance
to
do
that
spur
act
again
that
was
the
hit
of
the
piece
he
broke
off
conscious
suddenly
that
the
girl
had
for
some
time
been
holding
a
most
peculiar
stare
rigidly
upon
him
she
had
at
first
narrowed
her
right
eye
at
a
calculating
angle
as
she
listened
but
for
a
long
time
now
the
eyes
had
been
widened
to
this
inexplicable
stare
eloquent
of
many
hidden
things
as
he
stopped
his
speech
made
ill
at
ease
by
the
incessant
pressing
of
the
look
he
was
caught
and
held
by
it
to
a
longer
silence
than
he
had
meant
to
permit
he
could
now
read
meanings
that
unflinching
look
incurred
by
his
smooth
bluster
was
a
telling
blend
of
pity
and
of
wonder
so
you
know
do
you
she
demanded
that
you
look
just
enough
too
much
like
harold
parmalee
so
that
you
re
funny
i
she
amended
seeing
him
wince
that
you
look
the
way
parmalee
would
look
if
he
had
brains
he
faltered
but
made
a
desperate
effort
to
recover
his
balance
and
besides
what
difference
does
it
make
if
we
did
good
pictures
we
d
have
to
sell
em
to
a
mob
and
what
s
a
mob
it
s
fifteen
years
old
and
nothing
but
admirers
or
something
like
that
like
muriel
mercer
that
wouldn
t
know
how
much
are
two
times
two
if
the
neighbours
didn
t
get
it
to
her
again
he
had
run
down
under
her
level
look
as
he
stopped
the
girl
on
the
couch
who
had
lain
with
the
blankets
to
her
neck
suddenly
threw
them
aside
and
sat
up
surprisingly
she
was
not
garbed
in
apparel
she
seemed
to
be
fully
dressed
a
long
moment
she
sat
thus
regarding
him
still
with
that
slow
look
unbelieving
yet
cherishing
his
eyes
fell
at
last
merton
he
heard
her
say
he
looked
up
but
she
did
not
speak
she
merely
gave
a
little
knowing
nod
of
the
head
and
opened
her
arms
to
him
quickly
he
knelt
beside
her
while
the
mothering
arms
enfolded
him
a
hand
pulled
his
head
to
her
breast
and
held
it
there
thus
she
rocked
gently
the
hand
gliding
up
to
smooth
his
hair
without
words
she
cherished
him
thus
a
long
time
the
gentle
rocking
back
and
forth
continued
it
s
it
s
like
that
other
time
you
found
me
his
bluster
had
gone
he
was
not
sure
of
his
voice
even
these
few
words
had
been
hard
he
did
not
try
more
there
there
there
she
whispered
it
s
all
right
everything
s
all
right
your
mother
s
got
you
right
here
and
she
ain
t
ever
going
to
let
you
go
never
going
to
let
you
she
was
patting
his
head
in
rhythm
with
her
rocking
as
she
snuggled
and
soothed
him
there
was
silence
for
another
interval
then
she
began
to
croon
a
song
above
him
as
she
rocked
though
the
lyric
was
plainly
an
improvisation
did
he
have
his
poor
old
mother
going
for
a
minute
yes
he
did
he
had
her
going
for
a
minute
for
a
minute
yes
he
had
her
going
good
for
a
minute
but
oh
he
won
t
ever
fool
her
very
long
very
long
not
very
long
because
he
can
t
fool
his
dear
old
mother
very
long
very
long
and
he
can
bet
on
that
bet
on
that
so
he
can
bet
a
lot
of
money
on
that
that
that
her
charge
had
grown
still
again
but
she
did
not
relax
her
tightened
arms
say
he
said
at
last
well
you
know
those
benches
where
we
wait
for
the
cars
do
i
know
them
the
imperative
inference
was
that
she
did
i
looked
at
the
store
yesterday
the
sign
down
there
says
himebaugh
s
dignified
system
of
deferred
yes
yes
i
well
i
saw
another
good
place
it
says
the
house
of
lucky
rings
you
know
rings
sure
i
know
that
s
all
well
he
threw
off
the
arms
and
got
to
his
feet
she
stood
up
then
well
all
right
they
were
both
constrained
now
both
affected
an
ease
that
neither
felt
it
seemed
to
be
conceded
without
words
that
they
must
very
lightly
skirt
the
edges
of
merton
gill
s
screen
art
they
talked
a
long
tune
volubly
of
other
things
of
the
girl
s
illness
from
which
she
now
seemed
most
happily
to
have
recovered
of
whether
she
was
afraid
of
him
she
professed
still
to
be
of
the
new
watch
whose
beauties
were
newly
admired
when
it
had
been
adjusted
to
its
owner
s
wrist
of
finances
they
talked
and
even
quite
simply
of
accessible
homes
where
two
could
live
as
cheaply
as
one
it
was
not
until
he
was
about
to
go
when
he
stood
at
the
door
while
the
girl
readjusted
his
cravat
smoothed
his
hair
and
administered
a
final
series
of
pats
where
they
seemed
most
needed
that
he
broke
ever
so
slightly
through
the
reserve
which
both
had
felt
congealing
about
a
certain
topic
you
know
he
said
i
happened
to
remember
the
title
of
a
book
this
morning
a
book
i
used
to
see
back
in
the
public
library
at
home
it
wasn
t
one
i
ever
read
maybe
tessie
kearns
read
it
anyway
she
had
a
poem
she
likes
a
lot
written
by
the
same
man
she
used
to
read
me
good
parts
of
it
but
i
never
read
the
book
because
the
title
sounded
kind
of
wild
like
there
couldn
t
be
any
such
thing
the
poem
had
just
a
plain
name
it
was
called
lucile
but
the
book
by
the
same
man
was
called
the
tragic
you
wouldn
t
think
there
could
be
a
tragic
comedian
would
you
well
look
at
she
looked
at
him
with
that
elusive
remote
flickering
back
in
her
eyes
but
she
only
said
be
sure
and
come
take
me
out
to
dinner
i
can
eat
and
don
t
forget
your
overcoat
and
listen
don
t
you
dare
go
into
himebaugh
s
till
i
can
go
with
one
minute
after
he
had
gone
the
montague
girl
was
at
the
telephone
hello
baird
please
is
this
baird
well
jeff
everything
s
jake
yeah
the
poor
thing
was
pretty
wild
when
he
got
here
first
he
began
to
bluff
he
d
got
an
earful
from
someone
probably
over
on
the
lot
and
he
put
it
over
on
me
for
a
minute
too
but
he
didn
t
last
good
he
was
awful
broke
up
when
the
end
came
bless
his
heart
but
you
bet
i
kissed
the
hurt
place
and
made
it
well
how
about
him
now
jeff
i
m
darned
if
i
can
tell
except
he
s
right
again
when
he
got
here
he
was
some

except

like

so
you
keep
on
reading
i
can
see
we

chapter
xx
onward
and
upward
at
the
first
showing
of
the
buckeye
company
s
new
comedy
five
laughs
entitled
brewing
trouble
two
important
members
of
its
cast
occupied
balcony
seats
and
one
of
them
throughout
the
piece
brazenly
applauded
the
screen
art
of
her
husband
i
don
t
care
who
sees
me
she
would
reply
ever
and
again
to
his
whispered
protests
the
new
piece
proved
to
be
a
rather
broadly
stressed
burlesque
of
the
type
of
picture
drama
that
has
done
so
much
to
endear
the
personality
of
edgar
wayne
to
his
public
it
was
accorded
a
hearty
reception
there
was
nothing
to
which
it
might
be
compared
save
the
company
s
previous
hearts
on
fire
and
it
seemed
to
be
felt
that
the
present
offering
had
surpassed
even
that
masterpiece
of
satire
the
gills
above
referred
to
watched
the
unwinding
celluloid
with
vastly
different
emotions
gill
was
hearty
in
her
enjoyment
as
has
been
indicated
her
husband
superficially
was
not
displeased
but
beneath
that
surface
of
calm
approval
beneath
even
the
look
of
bored
indifference
he
now
and
then
managed
there
still
ran
a
complication
of
emotions
not
the
least
of
which
was
honest
bewilderment
people
laughed
so
it
must
be
funny
and
it
was
good
to
be
known
as
an
artist
of
worth
even
if
the
effects
of
your
art
were
unintended
it
was
no
shock
to
him
to
learn
now
that
the
mechanical
appliance
in
his
s
kitchen
was
a
still
and
that
the
grape
juice
the
honest
country
boy
purveyed
to
the
rich
new
yorker
had
been
improved
in
rank
defiance
of
a
constitutional
amendment
and
even
during
the
filming
of
the
piece
he
had
suspected
that
the
little
sister
so
engagingly
played
by
the
present
gill
was
being
too
bold
with
slight
surprise
therefore
as
the
drama
unfolded
he
saw
that
she
had
in
the
most
brazen
manner
invited
the
attentions
of
the
city
villains
she
had
in
truth
been
only
too
eager
to
be
lured
to
the
great
city
with
all
its
pitfalls
and
had
bidden
the
old
home
farewell
in
her
simple
country
way
while
each
of
the
villains
in
turn
had
awaited
her
in
his
what
merton
had
not
been
privileged
to
watch
were
the
later
developments
of
this
villainy
for
just
beyond
the
little
hamlet
at
a
lonely
spot
in
the
road
each
of
the
had
been
stopped
by
a
gentleman
looking
much
like
the
clerk
in
the
hotel
save
that
he
was
profusely
bewhiskered
and
bore
in
a
menacing
fashion
declaring
that
no
scoundrel
could
take
his
little
daughter
from
him
he
deprived
the
villains
of
their
valuables
so
that
for
a
time
at
least
they
should
not
bring
other
unsuspecting
girls
to
grief
as
a
further
precaution
he
compelled
them
to
abandon
their
in
which
he
drove
off
with
the
rescued
daughter
he
was
later
seen
to
sell
the
cars
at
a
wayside
garage
and
after
dividing
their
spoils
with
his
daughter
to
hail
a
suburban
trolley
upon
which
they
both
returned
to
the
home
nest
where
the
little
girl
would
again
languish
at
the
gate
a
prey
to
any
designing
city
man
who
might
pass
she
seemed
so
defenceless
in
her
beauty
her
longing
for
pretty
clothes
and
city
ways
and
yet
so
capably
pro
by
this
opportune
father
who
appeared
to
foresee
the
moment
of
her
flights
he
learned
without
a
tremor
that
among
the
triumphs
of
his
inventive
genius
had
been
a
machine
for
making
ten
dollar
bills
at
which
the
new
york
capitalist
had
exclaimed
that
the
state
right
for
iowa
alone
would
bring
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
even
more
remunerative
it
would
seem
had
been
his
other
patent
the
folding
boomerang
the
manager
of
the
largest
boomerang
factory
in
australia
stood
ready
to
purchase
this
device
for
ten
million
dollars
and
there
was
a
final
view
of
the
little
home
after
prosperity
had
come
to
its
inmates
so
long
threatened
with
ruin
a
sign
over
the
door
read
ye
olde
fashioned
gifte
shoppe
and
under
it
flaunted
to
the
wayside
was
the
severely
simple
of
a
high
boot
these
things
he
now
knew
were
to
be
expected
among
the
deft
infamies
of
a
buckeye
comedy
but
the
present
piece
held
in
store
for
him
a
complication
that
despite
his
already
rich
experience
of
buckeye
methods
caused
him
distressing
periods
of
heat
and
cold
while
he
watched
its
incredible
unfolding
early
in
the
piece
indeed
he
had
begun
to
suspect
in
the
luring
of
his
little
sister
a
grotesque
parallel
to
the
bold
advances
made
him
by
the
new
york
society
girl
he
at
once
feared
some
such
interpretation
when
he
saw
himself
coy
and
embarrassed
before
her
attack
and
he
was
certain
this
was
intended
when
he
beheld
himself
embraced
by
this
reckless
young
woman
who
behaved
in
the
manner
of
male
screen
idols
during
the
last
dozen
feet
of
the
last
reel
but
how
could
he
have
suspected
the
lengths
to
which
a
perverted
spirit
of
satire
would
lead
the
buckeye
director
for
now
he
staggered
through
the
blinding
snow
a
bundle
clasped
to
his
breast
he
fell
half
fainting
at
the
door
of
the
old
home
he
groped
for
the
knob
and
staggered
in
to
kneel
at
his
mother
s
feet
and
she
sternly
repulsed
him
a
finger
pointing
to
the
still
open
door
unbelievably
the
screen
made
her
say
he
wears
no
ring
back
to
the
snow
with
em
both
throw
em
way
down
east
and
baird
had
said
the
bundle
would
contain
one
of
his
patents
gill
watched
this
scene
with
tense
absorption
when
the
mother
s
iron
heart
had
relented
she
turned
to
her
husband
you
dear
thing
that
was
a
beautiful
piece
of
work

re

that
cinches
your

of
in
your

he
said
stoutly
he
shivered
or
did
he
shudder
and
quickly
reached
to
take
her
hand
it
was
a
simple
direct
gesture
yet
somehow
it
richly
had
the
quality
of
pleading
mother
understands
she
whispered
only
remember
you
mustn
t
seem
to
think
it

said
again
but
in
his
torn
heart
he
stubbornly
cried

six
months
later

emblazoned
upon
its
front
cover
a
promise
that
in
the
succeeding
number
would
appear
a
profusely
illustrated
interview
by
augusta
blivens
with
that
rising
young
screen
actor
merton
gill
the
promise
was
kept
the
interview
wandered
amid
photographic
reproductions
of
the
luxurious
hollywood
bungalow
set
among
palms
and
climbing
roses
the
actor
and
his
wife
in
their
roadster

at
the
wheel
the
actor
in
his
costume
of
chaps
and
sombrero
rolling

lawn
before
the
bungalow
and
the
young
wife
aproned
in
her
kitchen
earnestly
busy
with
spoon
and
mixing
bowl
it
is
perhaps
not
generally
known
wrote
miss
blivens
that
the
honour
of
having
discovered
this
latest
luminary
in
the
stellar
firmament
should
be
credited
to
director
howard
henshaw
of
the
victor
forces
indeed
i
had
not
known
this
myself
until
the
day
i
casually
mentioned
the
gills
in
his
presence
i
lingered
on
a
set
of
island
love
at
present
being
filmed
by
this
master
of
the
unspoken
drama
having
but
a
moment
since
left
that
dainty
little
reigning
queen
of
the
celluloid
dynasty
muriel
mercer
seated
with
her
in
the
tiny
bijou
boudoir
of
her
bungalow
dressing
room
on
the
great
holden
lot
its
walls
lined
with
the
works
of
her
favourite
authors
for
one
never
finds
this
soulful
little
girl
far
from
the
books
that
have
developed
her
mentally
as
the
art
of
the
screen
has
developed
her
emotionally
she
had
referred
me
to
the
director
when
i
sought
further
details
of
her
forthcoming
great
production
an
idyl
of
island
romance
and
adventure
and
presently
when
i
had
secured
from
him
the
information
i
needed
concerning
this
unique
little
drama
of
the
great
south
seas
i
chanced
to
mention
my
approaching
encounter
with
the
young
star
of
the
buckeye
forces
an
encounter
to
which
i
looked
forward
with
some
dismay
mr
henshaw
pausing
in
his
task
of
effecting
certain
changes
in
the
interior
of
the
island
hut
reassured
me
you
need
have
no
fear
about
your
meeting
with
gill
he
said
you
will
find
him
quite
simple
and
unaffected
an
artist
and
yet
sanely
it
was
now
that
he
revealed
his
own
part
in
the
launching
of
this
young
star
i
fancy
it
is
not
generally
known
he
continued
that
to
me
should
go
the
honour
of
having
discovered
gill
it
is
a
fact
however
he
appeared
as
an
extra
one
morning
in
the
cabaret
scene
we
used
in
miss
mercer
s
tremendous
hit
the
blight
of
broadway
instantly
as
you
may
suppose
i
was
struck
by
the
extraordinary
distinction
of
his
face
and
bearing
in
that
crowd
composed
of
average
extra
people
he
stood
out
to
my
eye
as
one
made
for
big
things
after
only
a
moment
s
chat
with
him
i
gave
him
a
seat
at
the
edge
of
the
dancing
floor
and
used
him
most
effectively
in
portraying
the
basic
idea
of
this
profoundly
stirring
drama
in
which
miss
mercer
was
to
achieve
one
of
her
brightest
triumphs
watch
that
play
you
will
discover
young
gill
in
many
of
the
where
under
my
direction
he
brought
out
the
psychological
the
symbolic
if
i
may
use
the
term
values
of
the
great
idea
underlying
our
story
even
in
these
bits
he
revealed
the
fine
artistry
which
he
has
since
demonstrated
more
broadly
under
another
director
to
my
lasting
regret
the
piece
was
then
too
far
along
to
give
him
a
more
important
part
though
i
intended
to
offer
him
something
good
in
our
next
play
for
muriel
mercer
you
may
recall
her
gorgeous
success
in
her
father
s
wife
but
i
was
never
able
to
find
the
chap
again
i
made
inquiries
of
course
and
felt
a
really
personal
sense
of
loss
when
i
could
get
no
trace
of
him
i
knew
then
as
well
as
i
know
now
that
he
was
destined
for
eminence
in
our
world
of
painted
shadows
you
may
imagine
my
chagrin
later
when
i
learned
that
another
director
was
to
reap
the
rewards
of
a
discovery
all
my
and
so
continued
miss
blivens
it
was
with
the
henshaw
words
still
in
my
ears
that
i
first
came
into
the
presence
of
merton
gill
feeling
that
he
he
at
once
finely
did
put
me
at
my
ease
simple
unaffected
modest
he
is
one
whom
success
has
not
spoiled
both
on
the
set
where
i
presently
found
him
playing
the
part
of
a
titled
roue
in
the
new
buckeye
comedy
to
be
called
one
hears
nearly
sweethearts
or
something
later
in
the
luxurious
but
homelike
nest
which
the
young
star
has
provided
for
his
bride
of
a
few
was
flips
montague
one
recalls
daughter
of
a
long
line
of
theatrical
folk
dating
back
to
days
of
the
merely
spoken
proved
to
be
finely
unspoiled
and
surprisingly
unlike
the
killingly
droll
mime
of
the
buckeye
constellation
indeed
one
can
not
but
be
struck
at
once
by
the
deep
vein
of
seriousness
underlying
the
comedian
s
surface
drollery
his
sense
of
humour
must
be
tremendous
and
yet
only
in
the
briefest
flashes
of
his
whimsical
manner
can
one
divine
it
let
us
talk
only
of
my
work
he
begged
me
only
that
can
interest
my
and
so
very
seriously
we
talked
of
his
work
have
you
ever
thought
of
playing
serious
parts
i
asked
being
now
wholly
put
at
my
ease
by
his
friendly
unaffected
ways
he
debated
a
moment
his
face
rigidly
set
inscrutable
to
my
glance
then
he
relaxed
into
one
of
those
whimsically
appealing
smiles
that
somehow
are
acutely
eloquent
of
pathos
serious
parts
with
this
face
of
mine
he
responded
and
my
query
had
been
answered
yet
he
went
on
no
i
shall
never
play
hamlet
i
can
give
a
good
imitation
of
a
bad
actor
but
doubtless
i
should
give
a
very
bad
imitation
of
a
good
one
et
vailet
i
remarked
to
myself
the
man
with
a
few
simple
strokes
of
the
brush
had
limned
me
his
portrait
and
i
was
struck
again
with
that
pathetic
appeal
in
face
and
voice
as
he
spoke
so
confidingly
after
all
is
not
pure
pathos
the
of
great
comedy
we
laugh
but
more
poignantly
because
our
hearts
are
tugged
at
and
here
was
a
master
of
the
note
pathetic
who
that
has
roared
over
the
gill
struggle
with
the
dreadful
spurs
was
not
even
at
the
climax
of
his
merriment
sympathetically
aware
of
his
earnest
persistence
the
pained
sincerity
of
his
repeated
strivings
the
genuine
anguish
distorting
his
face
as
he
senses
the
everlasting
futility
of
his
efforts
who
that
rocked
with
laughter
at
the
lesson
in
object
alimony
could
be
impervious
to
the
facial
agony
above
those
incompetent
disobedient
heedless
feet
here
was
honest
endeavour
an
almost
prayerful
determination
again
and
again
thwarted
by
feet
that
recked
not
of
rhythm
or
even
of
bare
mechanical
accuracy
those
feet
so
apparently
aimless
so
little
under
control
were
perhaps
the
most
mirthful
feet
the
scored
failure
in
the
dance
but
the
face
conscious
of
their
clumsiness
was
a
mask
of
fine
tragedy
such
is
the
combination
it
seems
to
me
that
has
produced
the
artistry
now
so
generally
applauded
an
artistry
that
perhaps
achieved
its
full
flowering
in
that
powerful
bit
toward
the
close
of
brewing
trouble
the
return
of
the
erring
son
with
his
agony
of
appeal
so
markedly
portrayed
that
for
the
moment
one
almost
forgot
the
wildly
absurd
burlesque
of
which
it
formed
the
joyous
yet
truly
emotional
apex
i
spoke
of
this
true
burlesque
is
after
all
the
highest
criticism
don
t
you
think
he
asked
me
doesn
t
it
make
demands
which
only
a
sophisticated
audience
can
t
it
rather
criticism
and
i
saw
that
he
had
thought
deeply
about
his
art
it
is
because
of
this
he
went
on
that
we
must
resort
to
so
much
of
the
merely
stuff
in
our
comedies
for
after
all
our
picture
audience
twenty
million
people
a
day
surely
one
can
make
no
great
demands
upon
their
he
considered
a
moment
seemingly
lost
in
memories
of
his
work
i
dare
say
he
concluded
there
are
not
twenty
million
people
of
taste
and
real
intelligence
in
the
whole
yet
it
must
not
be
thought
that
this
young
man
would
play
the
cynic
he
is
superbly
the
optimist
though
now
again
he
struck
a
note
of
almost
cynic
whimsicality
of
course
our
art
is
in
its
infancy
he
waited
for
my
nod
of
agreement
then
dryly
added
we
must
i
think
consider
it
the
peter
pan
of
the
arts
and
i
dare
say
you
recall
the
outstanding
biological
freakishness
of
but
a
smile
that
slow
almost
puzzled
smile
of
his
accompanied
the
words
you
might
he
told
me
at
parting
call
me
the
tragic
and
again
i
saw
that
this
actor
is
set
apart
from
the
run
of
his
brethren
by
an
almost
uncanny
gift
for
introspection
he
has
ruthlessly
analysed
himself
he
knows
as
he
put
it
what
god
meant
him
to
was
here
a
hint
of
poor
cyrano
i
left
after
some
brief
reference
to
his
devoted
young
wife
who
in
studio
or
home
is
never
far
from
his
side
it
is
true
that
i
have
struggled
and
sacrificed
to
give
the
public
something
better
and
finer
he
told
me
then
but
i
owe
my
real
success
all
to
he
took
the
young
wife
s
hand
in
both
his
own
and
very
simply
unaffectedly
raised
it
to
his
cheek
where
he
held
it
a
moment
with
that
dreamy
remembering
light
in
his
eyes
as
of
one
striving
to
recall
bits
of
his
past
i
think
that
s
all
he
said
at
last
but
on
the
instant
of
my
going
he
checked
me
once
more
no
it
isn
t
he
brightened
i
want
you
to
tell
your
readers
that
this
little
woman
is
more
than
my
wife
she
is
my
best
pal
and
i
may
also
add
my
severest
critic
