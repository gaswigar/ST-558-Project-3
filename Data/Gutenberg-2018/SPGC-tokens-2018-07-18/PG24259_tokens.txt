oh
well
you
know
how
women
are
she
emerges
from
the
shop
she
is
any
woman
and
the
shop
from
which
she
emerges
is
any
shop
in
any
town
she
has
been
shopping
this
does
not
imply
that
she
has
been
buying
anything
or
that
she
has
contemplated
buying
anything
but
merely
that
she
has
been
shopping
a
very
different
pursuit
from
buying
buying
implies
business
for
the
shop
shopping
merely
implies
business
for
the
clerks
as
stated
she
emerges
in
the
doorway
she
runs
into
a
woman
of
her
acquaintance
if
she
likes
the
other
woman
she
is
cordial
but
if
she
does
not
like
her
she
is
very
very
cordial
a
woman
aversion
for
another
woman
moving
in
the
same
social
stratum
in
which
she
herself
moves
may
readily
be
appraised
invariably
it
is
in
inverse
ratio
to
the
apparent
affection
she
displays
upon
encountering
the
object
of
her
disfavor
why
should
this
be
i
can
not
answer
it
is
not
given
for
us
to
know
very
well
then
she
meets
the
other
woman
at
the
door
they
stop
for
conversation
two
men
meeting
under
the
same
condition
would
mechanically
draw
away
a
few
paces
out
of
the
route
of
persons
passing
in
or
out
of
the
shop
no
particular
play
of
the
mental
processes
would
actuate
them
in
so
doing
an
instinctive
impulse
operating
mechanically
and
subconsciously
would
impel
them
to
remove
themselves
from
the
main
path
of
foot
travel
but
this
woman
and
her
acquaintance
take
root
right
there
persons
dodge
round
them
and
glare
at
them
other
persons
bump
into
them
and
are
glared
at
by
the
two
traffic
blockers
where
they
stand
they
make
a
knot
of
confusion
but
does
it
occur
to
either
of
them
to
suggest
that
they
might
step
aside
five
feet
or
ten
and
save
themselves
and
the
pedestrian
classes
generally
a
deal
of
delay
and
considerable
annoyance
it
does
not
it
never
will
if
the
meeting
took
place
in
a
narrow
passageway
or
on
a
populous
staircase
or
at
the
edge
of
the
orbit
of
a
set
of
swinging
doors
or
on
a
fire
escape
landing
upon
the
front
of
a
burning
building
while
one
was
going
up
to
aid
in
the
rescue
and
the
other
was
coming
down
to
be
saved
if
it
took
place
just
outside
the
pearly
gates
on
the
last
day
when
the
quick
and
the
dead
called
up
for
judgment
were
streaming
in
through
the
portals
still
would
they
behave
thus
where
they
met
would
be
where
they
stopped
to
talk
regardless
of
the
consequences
to
themselves
regardless
of
impediment
to
the
movements
of
their
fellow
beings
having
had
her
say
with
her
dear
friend
or
her
dear
enemy
as
the
case
may
be
our
heroine
proceeds
to
the
corner
and
hails
a
passing
street
car
because
her
heels
are
so
high
and
her
skirts
are
so
snug
she
takes
about
twice
the
time
to
climb
aboard
that
a
biped
in
trousers
would
take
into
the
car
she
comes
teetering
and
swaying
the
car
is
no
more
than
comfortably
filled
true
all
the
seats
at
the
back
where
she
has
entered
are
occupied
but
up
at
the
front
there
still
is
room
for
another
sittee
or
two
does
she
look
about
her
to
ascertain
whether
there
is
any
space
left
i
need
not
pause
for
reply
i
know
it
already
and
so
do
you
midway
of
the
she
stops
and
reaches
for
a
strap
she
makes
an
appealing
picture
compounded
of
blindness
helplessness
and
discomfort
she
has
clinging
vine
written
all
over
her
she
craves
to
cling
but
there
is
no
trellis
so
she
swings
from
her
strap
the
passengers
nearest
her
are
all
men
she
stares
at
them
accusingly
one
of
them
bends
forward
to
touch
her
and
tell
her
that
there
is
room
for
her
up
forward
but
now
there
are
any
seats
left
male
passengers
swinging
aboard
behind
her
have
already
scrouged
on
by
her
and
taken
the
vacant
places
in
the
mind
of
one
of
the
men
in
her
immediate
vicinity
chivalry
triumphs
over
impatience
he
gives
a
shrug
of
petulance
arises
and
begs
her
to
have
his
seat
she
is
not
entitled
to
it
on
any
ground
save
compassion
upon
his
part
by
refusing
to
use
the
eyes
in
her
head
she
has
forfeited
all
right
to
special
consideration
but
he
surrenders
his
place
to
her
and
she
takes
it
the
car
bumps
along
the
conductor
making
his
rounds
reaches
her
she
knows
he
is
coming
at
least
she
should
know
it
a
visit
from
the
conductor
has
been
a
feature
of
every
one
of
the
thousands
of
rides
that
she
has
taken
in
her
life
she
might
have
been
getting
her
fare
ready
for
him
there
are
a
dozen
handy
spots
where
she
might
have
had
a
receptacle
built
for
carrying
small
change
in
a
pocket
in
her
skirt
in
a
fob
at
her
belt
in
her
sleeve
or
under
her
cuff
counting
fob
pockets
and
change
pockets
a
man
has
from
nine
to
fifteen
pockets
in
his
everyday
garments
if
also
he
is
wearing
an
overcoat
add
at
least
three
more
pockets
to
the
total
it
would
seem
that
she
might
have
had
at
least
one
dependable
pocket
but
she
has
none
the
conductor
stops
facing
her
and
meanwhile
wearing
on
his
face
that
air
of
pained
resignation
which
is
common
to
the
faces
of
conductors
on
transportation
lines
that
are
heavily
patronized
by
women
travelers
in
mute
demand
he
extends
toward
her
a
soiled
palm
with
hands
encased
in
oversight
gloves
she
fumbles
at
the
catch
of
a
hand
bag
having
wrested
the
hand
bag
open
she
paws
about
among
its
myriad
and
mysterious
contents
a
card
of
buttons
a
sheaf
of
samples
a
handkerchief
a
powder
puff
for
inducing
low
visibility
of
the
human
nose
a
small
parcel
of
something
a
nail
file
and
other
minor
articles
are
disclosed
before
she
disinters
her
purse
from
the
bottom
of
her
hand
bag
another
struggle
with
the
clasp
of
the
purse
ensues
finally
one
by
one
five
coppers
are
fished
up
out
of
the
depths
and
presented
to
the
conductor
the
lady
has
made
a
difficult
complicated
rite
of
what
might
have
been
a
simple
and
a
swift
formality
the
car
proceeds
upon
its
course
she
sits
in
her
seat
wearing
that
look
of
comfortable
which
a
woman
invariably
wears
when
she
is
among
strangers
and
when
she
feels
herself
to
be
well
dressed
and
making
a
satisfactory
public
appearance
she
comes
out
of
her
trance
with
a
start
on
discovering
that
the
car
has
passed
her
corner
or
is
about
to
pass
it
all
flurried
she
arises
and
signals
the
conductor
that
she
is
alighting
here
from
her
air
and
her
expression
we
may
gather
that
mentally
she
holds
him
responsible
for
the
fact
that
she
has
been
carried
on
beyond
her
proper
destination
the
car
having
stopped
she
makes
her
way
to
the
rear
platform
and
gets
off
gets
off
the
wrong
way
that
is
to
say
she
gets
off
with
face
toward
the
rear
thus
is
achieved
a
twofold
result
she
blocks
the
way
of
anyone
who
may
be
desirous
of
getting
aboard
the
car
as
she
gets
off
of
it
and
if
the
car
should
start
up
suddenly
before
her
feet
have
touched
the
earth
or
before
her
grip
on
the
hand
rail
has
been
relaxed
she
will
be
flung
violently
down
upon
the
back
of
her
head
from
the
time
he
is
a
small
boy
until
he
is
in
his
dotage
a
man
swings
off
a
car
facing
in
the
direction
in
which
the
car
is
headed
then
a
premature
turn
of
a
wheel
pitches
him
forward
with
a
good
chance
to
alight
upon
his
feet
whereas
the
same
thing
happening
when
he
was
facing
in
the
opposite
direction
would
cause
him
to
tumble
over
backward
with
excellent
prospects
of
cracking
his
skull
but
in
obedience
to
an
immutable
but
inexplicable
vagary
of
sex
a
woman
follows
the
patently
wrong
the
obviously
dangerous
the
plainly
awkward
system
as
the
conductor
rings
the
starting
bell
he
glances
toward
a
man
who
is
riding
on
the
rear
platform
kin
you
beat
says
the
conductor
i
ast
you
kin
you
beat
the
man
to
whom
he
has
put
the
question
is
a
married
man
being
in
this
state
of
marriage
he
appreciates
that
the
longer
you
live
with
them
the
less
able
are
you
to
fathom
the
workings
of
their
minds
with
regard
to
many
of
the
simpler
things
of
life
speaking
therefore
from
the
heights
of
his
superior
understanding
he
says
in
reply
oh
well
you
know
how
women
are
we
know
how
women
are
but
nobody
knows
why
they
are
as
they
are
please
let
me
make
myself
clear
on
one
point
as
an
institution
and
as
individuals
i
am
for
women
they
constitute
and
deservedly
too
the
most
popular
sex
we
have
since
away
back
yonder
i
have
been
in
favor
of
granting
them
suffrage
for
years
i
have
felt
it
as
a
profound
conviction
that
the
franchise
should
be
expanded
at
one
end
and
abridged
at
the
other
made
larger
to
admit
some
of
the
women
made
smaller
to
bar
out
some
of
the
men
i
could
think
of
very
many
reasons
why
the
average
woman
should
want
to
mix
in
politics
but
if
she
did
wish
so
to
mix
and
mingle
i
could
think
of
a
single
valid
reason
why
she
should
not
have
full
permission
not
as
a
privilege
not
as
a
boon
but
as
a
common
right
nor
could
i
bring
myself
to
share
in
any
degree
the
apprehension
of
some
of
the
who
held
that
giving
women
votes
would
take
many
of
them
entirely
out
of
the
state
of
motherhood
i
can
not
believe
that
all
the
children
of
the
future
are
going
to
be
born
on
the
first
tuesday
after
the
first
monday
in
november
surely
some
of
them
will
be
born
on
other
dates
indeed
the
only
valid
argument
against
woman
suffrage
that
i
could
think
of
was
the
conduct
of
some
of
the
women
who
have
been
for
it
to
myself
i
often
said
certainly
i
favor
giving
them
the
vote
seeing
what
a
mess
the
members
of
my
own
sex
so
often
make
of
the
job
of
trying
to
run
the
country
i
do
anticipate
that
the
republic
will
go
upon
the
shoals
immediately
after
women
begin
voting
and
campaigning
and
running
for
office
at
the
helm
of
the
ship
of
state
we
put
some
pretty
sad
steersman
from
time
to
time
better
the
hand
that
rocks
the
cradle
than
the
hand
that
rocks
the
boat
we
men
have
let
slip
nearly
all
of
the
personal
liberties
for
which
our
fathers
fought
and
bled
that
is
to
say
fought
the
britishers
and
bled
the
injuns
ever
since
the
civil
war
we
have
been
so
dummed
busy
telling
the
rest
of
the
world
how
free
we
were
that
we
failed
to
safeguard
that
freedom
of
which
we
boasted
we
commiserate
the
englishman
because
he
chooses
to
live
under
an
hereditary
president
called
a
king
while
we
are
amply
content
to
go
on
living
under
an
elected
king
called
a
president
we
can
not
understand
why
he
a
free
citizen
of
the
country
on
earth
insists
on
calling
himself
a
subject
but
we
are
reconciled
to
the
fiction
of
proclaiming
ourselves
citizens
while
each
day
more
and
more
we
are
becoming
subjects
the
subjects
of
sumptuary
legislation
the
subjects
of
statutes
framed
by
bigoted
or
frightened
lawgivers
the
subjects
of
arbitrary
mandates
and
of
arbitrary
decrees
the
subjects
the
abject
cringing
subjects
of
the
servant
classes
the
police
classes
the
labor
classes
the
capitalistic
classes
naturally
as
a
democrat
i
have
felt
these
things
with
enhanced
bitterness
when
the
republicans
were
in
office
nevertheless
i
have
felt
them
at
other
times
too
and
continuing
along
this
line
of
thought
i
have
repeatedly
said
to
myself
in
view
of
these
conditions
let
us
give
the
vote
eventually
but
not
just
yet
while
still
we
have
control
of
the
machinery
of
the
ballot
let
us
put
them
on
probation
as
it
were
they
claim
to
be
rational
creatures
very
well
then
make
prove
it
let
us
give
the
vote
just
as
soon
as
they
have
learned
the
right
way
in
which
to
get
off
of
a
street
car
in
this
though
i
have
changed
my
mind
i
realize
now
that
the
demand
was
impossible
that
it
was
oh
well
you
know
what
women
are
we
have
given
woman
social
superiority
rather
she
has
acquired
it
through
having
earned
it
shortly
she
will
have
been
put
on
a
basis
of
political
equality
with
men
in
all
the
states
of
the
union
now
she
thinks
she
wants
economic
equality
but
she
does
she
only
thinks
she
does
if
she
should
get
it
she
would
refuse
to
abide
by
its
natural
limitations
on
the
one
side
and
its
natural
expansions
for
her
sphere
of
economic
development
on
the
other
for
temperamentally
god
so
fashioned
her
that
never
can
she
altogether
quit
being
the
clinging
vine
and
become
the
sturdy
oak
she
insist
on
having
all
the
prerogatives
of
the
oak
but
at
the
same
time
she
will
strive
to
retain
the
special
considerations
accorded
to
the
vine
which
clings
if
i
know
anything
about
her
dear
wonderful
incomprehensible
self
she
belongs
to
the
sex
which
would
eat
its
cake
and
have
it
too
some
men
are
constructed
after
this
design
but
nearly
all
women
are
give
her
equal
opportunities
with
men
in
business
put
her
on
the
same
footing
and
pay
to
her
the
same
salary
that
a
man
holding
a
similar
job
is
paid
so
far
so
good
but
then
as
her
employer
undertake
to
hand
out
to
her
exactly
the
same
treatment
which
the
man
holding
a
like
position
expects
and
accepts
there
where
boss
strikes
a
snag
the
salary
she
will
take
oh
yes
but
she
arrogates
to
herself
the
sweet
boon
of
weeping
when
things
distress
her
and
when
things
harass
her
of
going
off
into
tantrums
of
temper
which
no
man
in
authority
however
patient
would
tolerate
on
the
part
of
another
man
serving
under
him
grant
to
her
equal
powers
equal
responsibilities
equal
favors
and
a
pay
envelope
on
saturday
night
containing
as
much
money
as
her
male
receives
that
is
all
very
well
but
seek
however
gently
however
tactfully
however
diplomatically
to
suggest
to
her
that
a
simpler
more
businesslike
garb
than
the
garb
she
favors
would
be
the
sane
and
the
sensible
thing
for
business
wear
in
business
hours
and
then
just
see
what
happens
a
working
woman
who
through
the
working
day
dresses
in
plain
neat
frocks
with
no
jangling
bracelets
upon
her
arms
no
foolish
furbelows
at
her
wrists
no
vain
adornments
about
her
throat
no
exaggerated
coiffure
is
a
delight
to
the
eye
and
better
still
she
fits
the
setting
of
her
environment
two
of
the
most
competent
and
dependable
human
beings
i
know
are
both
of
them
women
one
is
the
assistant
editor
of
a
weekly
magazine
the
other
is
the
head
of
an
important
department
in
an
important
industry
in
the
evening
you
would
never
find
a
woman
better
groomed
or
if
the
occasion
demand
more
ornately
than
either
one
of
these
young
women
will
be
but
always
while
on
duty
they
wear
a
correct
and
proper
costume
for
the
work
they
are
doing
and
they
match
the
picture
these
two
though
are
i
think
exceptions
to
the
rule
of
their
sex
trained
nurses
wear
the
most
becoming
uniforms
and
the
most
suitable
considering
their
calling
that
were
ever
devised
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
belief
there
is
no
record
where
a
marriageable
male
patient
on
the
road
to
recovery
and
in
that
impressionable
mood
which
accompanies
the
convalescence
of
an
ordinarily
healthy
man
failed
to
fall
in
love
with
his
nurse
a
competent
professional
nurse
who
has
the
added
advantage
on
her
side
of
being
comely
and
it
is
powerfully
hard
for
her
to
avoid
being
comely
in
her
spotless
blue
and
starchy
white
stands
more
chances
of
getting
the
right
sort
of
man
for
a
husband
than
any
billionaire
daughter
alive
but
i
sometimes
wonder
what
weird
sartorial
eccentricities
some
of
them
would
indulge
in
did
not
convention
and
the
standing
laws
of
their
profession
require
of
them
that
they
all
dress
after
a
given
pattern
and
if
the
owners
and
managers
of
big
city
shops
once
lifted
the
rule
prescribing
certain
modes
for
their
female
working
staffs
if
they
should
give
their
women
clerks
a
free
hand
in
choosing
their
own
wardrobes
for
store
hours
well
you
know
how
women
are
nevertheless
and
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
i
will
admit
while
i
am
on
this
phase
of
my
topic
that
there
likewise
is
something
to
be
said
in
dispraise
of
my
own
sex
too
in
the
other
and
better
half
of
this
literary
double
act
my
admired
and
talented
friend
mary
roberts
rinehart
cites
chapter
and
verse
to
prove
the
unaccountable
vagaries
of
some
men
in
the
matter
of
dress
there
she
made
but
one
mistake
a
mistake
of
she
mentioned
specifically
some
men
she
should
have
included
all
men
the
only
imaginable
reason
why
any
rational
of
adult
age
clings
to
the
habiliments
ordained
for
him
by
the
custom
and
the
tailors
of
this
generation
is
because
he
is
used
to
them
a
man
can
stand
anything
once
he
gets
used
to
it
because
getting
used
to
a
thing
commonly
means
that
the
habitee
has
quit
worrying
about
it
and
yet
since
the
dawn
of
time
when
adam
poked
fun
at
eve
way
of
wearing
her
and
on
down
through
the
centuries
until
the
present
day
and
date
it
has
ever
been
the
custom
of
men
to
gibe
at
the
garments
worn
by
women
take
our
humorous
publications
which
i
scarcely
need
point
out
are
edited
by
men
hardly
could
our
comic
weeklies
manage
to
come
out
if
the
jokes
about
the
things
which
women
wear
were
denied
to
them
as
of
inspiration
to
the
vaudeville
monologist
his
jokes
about
his
wife
and
his
and
to
the
comic
sketch
artist
his
pictures
setting
forth
the
torments
of
the
stock
husband
trying
to
button
the
stock
gown
of
a
stock
wife
up
her
stock
back
these
are
dependable
and
inevitable
women
do
wear
maniacal
garments
sometimes
that
there
is
no
denying
but
on
the
other
hand
styles
for
women
change
with
such
frequency
that
no
quirk
of
fashion
however
foolish
and
disfiguring
ever
endures
for
long
enough
to
work
any
permanent
injury
in
the
health
of
its
temporarily
deluded
devotees
nothing
i
can
think
of
gets
with
such
rapidity
as
a
feminine
fashion
unless
it
is
an
egg
if
this
season
a
woman
skirt
is
so
scantily
fashioned
that
as
she
hobbles
along
she
has
the
appearance
of
being
like
the
lady
called
salammbo
it
is
as
sure
as
shooting
that
come
next
season
she
will
have
leapt
to
the
other
extreme
and
her
draperies
will
be
more
than
amply
voluminous
if
this
winter
her
sleeves
are
like
unto
sausage
casings
for
tightness
be
prepared
when
spring
arrives
to
see
her
wearing
practically
all
the
sleeves
there
are
about
once
in
so
often
she
is
found
wearing
a
mode
which
combines
beauty
with
saneness
but
that
often
is
not
very
often
but
even
when
they
are
at
apogee
of
sartorial
ridiculousness
i
maintain
that
the
garments
of
women
from
the
comfort
standpoint
anyhow
are
not
any
more
foolish
than
the
garments
to
which
the
average
man
is
incurably
addicted
if
women
are
vassals
to
fashion
men
are
slaves
to
convention
and
fashion
has
the
merit
that
it
alters
overnight
whereas
convention
is
a
slow
moving
thing
that
stands
still
a
long
time
before
it
does
move
convention
is
the
wooden
indian
of
civilization
but
fashion
is
a
in
the
temperate
zone
in
summertime
everywoman
looks
to
be
cooler
than
everyman
and
by
the
same
token
is
cooler
in
the
winter
she
wears
lighter
garments
than
he
would
dream
of
wearing
and
yet
stays
warmer
than
he
does
can
stand
more
exposure
without
outward
evidence
of
suffering
than
he
can
stand
and
is
less
susceptible
than
he
to
colds
and
grips
and
pneumonias
compare
the
thinness
of
her
heaviest
outdoor
wrap
with
the
thickness
of
his
lightest
ulster
or
the
heft
of
her
winter
suit
with
the
weight
of
the
outer
garments
which
he
wears
to
business
and
if
you
are
yourself
a
man
you
will
wonder
why
she
does
freeze
stiff
when
the
thermometer
falls
to
the
mark
observe
her
in
a
ballroom
that
is
overheated
in
the
corners
and
draughty
near
the
windows
as
all
ballrooms
are
her
neck
and
her
throat
her
bosom
and
arms
are
bare
her
frock
is
of
the
filmiest
gossamer
stuff
her
slippers
are
paper
thin
her
stockings
the
sheerest
of
textures
yet
she
does
sniff
and
her
nose
does
turn
red
and
the
skin
upon
her
exposed
shoulders
refuses
to
she
is
the
marvel
of
the
ages
she
is
neither
too
warm
nor
too
cold
she
is
just
right
consider
now
her
male
companion
in
his
gala
attire
one
minute
he
is
wringing
wet
with
perspiration
that
is
when
he
is
dancing
the
next
minute
he
is
visibly
congealing
that
is
because
he
has
stopped
to
catch
his
breath
why
this
difference
between
the
sexes
the
man
is
supposed
to
be
the
hardier
creature
of
the
two
but
he
ca
prove
it
of
course
there
may
be
something
in
the
theory
that
when
a
woman
feels
herself
to
be
smartly
dressed
an
exaltation
of
soul
lifts
her
far
above
realization
of
bodily
discomfort
but
i
make
so
bold
as
to
declare
that
the
real
reason
why
she
is
comfortable
and
he
is
not
lies
in
the
fact
that
despite
all
eccentricities
of
costume
in
which
she
sometimes
indulges
everywoman
goes
about
more
rationally
clad
than
everyman
does
for
the
sake
of
comparing
two
horrible
examples
let
us
take
a
woman
esteemed
to
be
at
all
points
and
angles
where
she
is
not
and
mentally
let
us
place
alongside
her
a
man
who
by
the
standards
of
his
times
and
his
contemporaries
is
conventionally
garbed
to
find
the
woman
we
want
we
probably
must
travel
to
new
york
and
seek
her
out
in
a
smart
restaurant
at
night
occasionally
she
is
found
elsewhere
but
it
is
only
in
new
york
that
city
where
so
many
of
the
young
women
are
prematurely
old
and
so
many
of
the
old
women
are
prematurely
young
that
she
abounds
in
sufficient
profusion
to
become
a
common
type
instead
of
an
infrequent
one
this
woman
is
waging
that
battle
against
the
mounting
birthdays
which
nobody
ever
yet
won
her
hair
has
been
dyed
in
those
rich
autumnal
tints
which
are
so
becoming
to
a
tree
in
its
indian
summer
but
so
unbecoming
to
a
woman
in
hers
richard
fox
might
have
designed
her
jewelry
she
glistens
with
diamonds
until
she
makes
you
think
of
the
ice
coming
out
of
the
hudson
river
in
the
early
spring
but
about
her
complexion
there
is
no
suggestion
of
a
march
thaw
for
it
is
a
shellac
her
eyebrows
are
the
kind
and
her
lips
were
done
by
hand
her
skirt
is
too
short
for
looks
and
too
tight
for
comfort
she
is
tightly
prisoned
at
the
waistline
and
not
sufficiently
confined
in
the
bust
there
is
nothing
natural
or
rational
anywhere
about
her
she
is
as
artificial
as
a
tin
minnow
and
she
glitters
like
one
next
your
attention
is
invited
to
the
male
of
the
species
he
is
assumed
to
be
dressed
in
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
good
taste
and
with
due
regard
for
all
the
ordinary
proprieties
but
is
he
before
deciding
whether
he
is
or
is
let
us
look
him
over
starting
from
the
feet
and
working
upward
a
matter
of
inches
above
his
insteps
brings
us
to
the
bottom
of
his
now
these
of
his
are
morally
certain
to
be
too
long
in
which
event
they
billow
down
over
his
feet
in
slovenly
and
ungraceful
folds
or
they
are
too
short
in
which
event
there
is
an
awkward
ugly
just
above
his
ankles
if
he
is
a
thin
man
his
dress
waistcoat
bulges
away
from
his
breastbone
so
the
passerby
can
easily
discover
what
brand
of
suspenders
he
fancies
but
if
he
be
stoutish
the
waistcoat
has
a
little
way
of
hitching
along
up
his
inch
by
inch
until
finally
it
has
itself
in
overlapping
folds
thwartwise
of
his
tummy
coyly
exposing
an
inch
or
so
of
clandestine
it
requires
great
on
the
part
of
the
owner
and
constant
watchfulness
as
well
to
keep
a
fat
man
dress
waistcoat
from
behaving
like
a
railroad
folder
his
dinner
coat
or
his
tail
coat
if
he
wears
a
tail
coat
is
invariably
too
tight
in
the
sleeves
nine
times
out
of
ten
it
binds
across
the
back
between
the
shoulders
and
bulges
out
in
a
pouch
effect
at
the
collar
his
shirt
front
if
is
as
cold
and
clammy
as
a
morgue
slab
when
first
he
puts
it
on
but
as
hot
and
sticky
as
a
priming
of
fresh
glue
after
he
has
worn
it
for
half
an
hour
in
an
overheated
room
and
all
public
rooms
in
america
are
overheated
should
it
be
of
the
pleated
or
medium
variety
no
power
on
earth
can
keep
it
from
appearing
rumply
and
untidy
that
is
no
power
can
if
the
wearer
be
a
normal
man
i
am
not
speaking
of
professional
or
models
for
the
illustrations
of
advertisements
in
the
magazines
his
collar
which
is
a
device
of
stiff
linen
and
yielding
starch
is
not
a
comparatively
modern
product
as
some
have
imagined
it
really
dates
back
to
the
spanish
inquisition
where
it
enjoyed
a
great
vogue
faring
abroad
he
encloses
his
head
let
us
say
in
a
derby
hat
some
people
think
the
homeliest
thing
ever
devised
by
man
is
grant
tomb
others
favor
the
louis
union
depot
but
i
am
pledged
to
the
derby
hat
and
the
high
or
hat
runs
second
this
being
the
case
for
and
against
the
parties
concerned
i
submit
to
the
reader
impartial
judgment
the
following
question
for
a
decision
taking
everything
into
consideration
which
of
these
two
really
deserves
the
booby
prize
for
unbecoming
apparel
the
woman
who
plainly
is
dressed
in
bad
form
or
the
man
who
is
supposed
to
be
dressed
in
good
form
but
this
i
will
say
for
him
as
being
in
his
favor
he
has
sense
enough
to
wear
plenty
of
pockets
and
in
his
most
infatuated
moments
he
never
wears
nether
garments
so
tight
that
he
ca
step
in
can
i
say
as
much
for
woman
i
can
not
a
few
pages
back
i
set
up
the
claim
that
woman
considered
as
a
sex
and
not
as
an
exceptional
type
can
not
divorce
the
social
relation
from
the
economic
i
think
of
an
illustration
to
prove
my
point
in
business
two
men
may
be
closely
associated
they
may
be
besides
chums
perhaps
at
the
same
club
may
borrow
money
from
each
other
and
wear
each
other
clothes
and
yet
so
far
as
any
purely
confidential
relation
touching
on
the
private
sides
of
their
lives
is
concerned
may
remain
as
far
apart
as
the
poles
it
is
hard
to
imagine
two
women
similarly
placed
behaving
after
the
same
standards
each
insists
upon
making
a
confidante
of
her
partner
their
intimacy
becomes
a
thing
complicated
with
extraneous
issues
with
jointly
shared
secrets
with
disclosures
as
to
personal
likes
and
dislikes
which
should
have
no
part
in
it
if
there
is
to
be
continued
harmony
free
from
or
lacerated
feelings
or
fancied
slights
or
blighted
affections
sooner
or
later
too
the
personality
of
the
stronger
nature
begins
to
overshadow
the
personality
of
the
weaker
almost
inevitably
there
is
a
i
do
not
share
the
somewhat
common
opinion
that
in
their
friendships
women
are
less
constant
than
men
are
but
the
trouble
with
them
is
that
they
put
a
heavier
burden
upon
friendship
than
so
delicate
so
sensitive
a
sentiment
as
real
friendship
is
was
ever
meant
to
bear
something
has
to
give
way
under
the
strain
and
something
does
to
be
sure
there
is
an
underlying
cause
in
extenuation
for
this
temperamental
shortcoming
which
in
justice
to
the
ostensibly
weaker
sex
should
be
set
forth
here
even
though
i
am
taking
on
the
rôle
of
advocate
in
the
struggle
to
keep
woman
from
canonizing
herself
by
main
force
i
want
to
be
as
fair
as
i
can
always
reserving
the
privilege
where
things
are
about
even
of
giving
my
own
side
a
shade
the
better
of
it
the
main
reason
why
women
confide
and
too
much
in
other
women
is
because
leading
more
circumscribed
lives
than
men
commonly
lead
they
are
driven
back
upon
themselves
and
into
themselves
and
their
sisters
for
interests
and
for
conversational
material
taking
them
by
and
large
they
have
less
with
which
to
concern
themselves
than
their
husbands
and
their
brothers
their
fathers
and
their
sons
have
therefore
they
concern
themselves
the
more
with
what
is
available
which
at
the
same
time
oftener
than
not
means
some
other
private
affairs
a
woman
becoming
thoroughly
imbued
with
an
idea
becomes
times
out
of
a
hundred
a
creature
of
one
idea
everything
else
on
earth
is
subordinated
to
the
thing
cabal
reform
propaganda
crusade
movement
or
what
not
in
which
she
is
interested
now
the
average
man
may
be
very
sincerely
and
very
enthusiastically
devoted
to
a
cause
but
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
it
will
obsess
him
through
every
waking
hour
but
the
ladies
god
bless
and
curb
are
not
built
that
way
a
woman
wedded
to
a
cause
is
divorced
from
all
else
she
resents
the
bare
thought
that
in
the
press
of
matters
and
the
clash
of
worlds
mankind
should
for
one
moment
turn
aside
from
her
pet
cause
to
concern
itself
with
newer
issues
and
wider
motives
from
a
devotee
she
soon
is
transformed
into
a
habitee
from
being
an
earnest
advocate
she
advances
or
retrogrades
to
the
status
of
a
plain
bore
to
be
a
common
nuisance
is
bad
enough
to
be
a
common
scold
is
worse
and
presently
she
turns
scold
and
goes
about
railing
shrilly
at
a
world
that
criminally
persists
in
thinking
of
other
topics
than
the
one
which
lies
closest
to
her
heart
and
loosest
on
her
tongue
than
a
woman
who
is
a
scold
there
is
but
one
more
exasperating
shape
of
a
woman
and
that
is
the
woman
who
not
content
with
being
the
most
contradictory
the
most
paradoxical
the
most
adorable
of
the
creations
to
wit
a
womanly
woman
tries
among
men
to
be
a
good
fellow
but
that
which
is
ordinarily
a
fault
may
on
occasion
of
extraordinary
stress
become
the
most
transcendent
and
the
most
admirable
of
virtues
i
think
of
this
last
war
and
of
the
share
our
women
and
the
women
of
other
lands
have
played
in
it
no
one
caviled
nor
complained
at
the
of
womankind
while
the
world
was
in
a
welter
of
woe
and
slaughter
of
all
that
they
had
worth
having
our
women
gave
and
gave
and
gave
and
gave
they
gave
their
sons
and
their
brothers
their
husbands
and
their
fathers
to
their
country
they
gave
of
their
time
and
of
their
energies
and
of
their
talent
they
gave
of
their
wonderful
mercy
and
their
wonderful
patience
and
their
yet
more
wonderful
courage
they
gave
of
the
work
of
their
hands
and
the
salt
of
their
souls
and
the
very
blood
of
their
hearts
for
every
suspected
woman

is
that
just
like
a
man
i
understand
that
irvin
cobb
is
going
to
write
a
sister
article
to
this
and
naturally
he
will
be
as
funny
as
only
he
can
be
it
is
always
allowable
too
to
be
humorous
about
women
they
do
mind
because
they
are
accustomed
to
it
but
i
simply
dare
not
risk
my
popularity
by
being
funny
about
men
why
bless
their
hearts
irvin
will
probably
say
of
his
subject
bless
their
little
hearts
odd
is
it
how
men
always
have
big
hearts
and
women
little
ones
but
we
are
good
packers
we
put
a
lot
in
i
could
be
terribly
funny
if
only
women
were
going
to
read
this
understand
they
know
all
about
men
they
go
and
put
on
a
negligee
and
get
six
baby
pillows
and
dab
a
little
cold
cream
around
their
eyes
and
then
lie
down
on
the
couch
and
read
and
they
would
all
think
i
must
have
known
their
somewhere
but
the
men
would
read
it
and
cancel
the
order
for
my
next
book
and
say
i
must
be
a
spinster
living
a
sort
of
existence
why
i
know
at
least
a
hundred
good
stories
about
one
man
alone
and
if
i
published
them
he
would
either
grow
suspicious
and
wonder
who
the
man
is
or
get
sulky
and
resent
bitterly
being
laughed
at
which
is
exactly
like
a
man
just
little
things
too
like
always
insisting
he
was
extremely
calm
at
his
wedding
when
the
entire
church
saw
him
step
off
a
platform
and
drop
seven
feet
into
tropical
foliage
you
see
women
quite
frequently
have
less
wit
than
men
but
they
take
themselves
quite
so
seriously
they
view
themselves
with
a
certain
somewhat
ironical
humor
men
love
a
joke
on
the
other
fellow
but
your
really
humorous
woman
loves
a
joke
on
herself
that
because
women
are
less
conventional
of
course
i
can
still
remember
the
face
of
the
horrified
gentleman
i
met
one
day
on
the
street
after
luncheon
who
had
unconsciously
tucked
the
corner
of
his
luncheon
napkin
into
his
watch
pocket
along
with
his
watch
and
his
burning
shame
when
i
observed
that
his
new
fashion
was
probably
convenient
but
certainly
novel
and
i
contrast
it
with
the
woman
prominent
in
the
theatrical
world
who
had
been
doing
a
little
dusting
yes
they
do
but
it
is
never
published
before
coming
to
lunch
with
me
she
walked
into
one
of
the
largest
of
the
new
york
hotels
hatted
veiled
and
and
wearing
tied
around
her
waist
a
large
checked
gingham
apron
now
i
opine
i
have
stolen
that
word
from
irvin
that
under
those
circumstances
or
something
approximating
them
such
as
pajama
trousers
or
the
neglect
to
conceal
that
portion
of
a
shirt
not
intended
for
the
public
eye
almost
any
man
of
my
acquaintance
would
have
made
a
wild
bolt
for
the
nearest
bar
hissing
like
a
teakettle
note
this
was
written
when
the
word
bar
did
not
mean
to
forbid
or
to
prohibit
the
lady
merely
stood
up
smilingly
took
it
off
and
gave
it
to
the
waiter
who
being
a
man
returned
it
later
wrapped
to
look
as
much
like
a
club
sandwich
as
possible
oh
they
conventional
these
men
right
enough
now
and
then
one
of
them
gathers
a
certain
amount
of
courage
and
goes
without
a
hat
to
save
his
hair
or
wears
sandals
to
keep
his
feet
cool
and
he
is
immediately
dismissed
as
mad
i
know
one
very
young
gentleman
who
nearly
broke
up
a
juvenile
dance
by
borrowing
his
mother
pink
silk
stockings
for
socks
and
wearing
her
best
pink
ribbon
as
a
tie
how
many
hours
do
you
suppose
were
wasted
by
the
new
army
practicing
salutes
in
front
of
a
mirror
a
good
many
right
arms
back
in
civies
have
a
stuttering
fit
whenever
they
approach
a
uniform
and
i
know
a
number
of
conventional
gentlemen
who
are
suffering
hours
of
torment
because
they
ca
remember
out
of
uniform
to
take
off
their
hats
to
the
women
they
meet
war
is
certainly
perdition
is
it
and
numbers
of
times
during
the
late
unpleasantness
i
have
seen
new
officers
standing
outside
a
general
door
trying
to
remember
the
rule
for
addressing
a
superior
and
cap
or
no
cap
while
not
wearing
side
arms
you
know
how
a
woman
would
do
it
she
would
give
a
tilt
to
her
hat
and
a
pull
here
and
there
and
then
she
would
walk
in
and
say
i
know
it
perfectly
horrible
but
i
simply
ca
remember
the
etiquette
of
this
sort
of
thing
please
do
tell
me
general
and
the
general
who
has
only
eleven
hundred
things
to
do
before
eating
a
bite
of
lunch
on
the
top
of
his
desk
will
get
up
and
gravely
instruct
her
which
is
exactly
like
a
man
of
course
men
overdo
etiquette
sometimes
because
of
a
conventional
fear
of
slipping
up
somewhere
there
was
a
nice
red
cross
major
in
france
who
had
had
no
instruction
in
military
matters
and
had
no
arrogance
whatever
so
he
used
to
salute
all
the
privates
and
the
before
they
had
a
chance
he
was
usually
asking
the
road
to
somewhere
or
other
and
they
would
stand
staring
after
him
thoughtfully
until
he
was
quite
out
of
sight
and
as
a
corollary
to
this
conventionality
how
wretched
men
are
when
they
are
placed
in
false
positions
nobody
likes
it
of
course
but
a
woman
can
generally
get
out
of
it
men
think
straighter
than
women
but
not
so
fast
i
dined
one
night
on
shipboard
with
the
captain
of
the
transport
on
which
i
came
back
from
france
and
there
was
an
army
chaplain
at
the
table
so
as
chaplains
frequently
say
grace
before
meat
i
put
a
hand
on
the
knee
of
a
young
male
member
of
my
family
beside
me
and
kept
it
there
ready
for
a
squeeze
to
admonish
silence
but
the
chaplain
did
not
say
grace
and
the
man
on
my
right
suddenly
turned
out
to
be
a
perfectly
strange
general
in
a
state
of
helpless
uneasiness
i
have
a
suspicion
that
not
even
the
absolute
impeccability
of
my
subsequent
conduct
convinced
him
that
i
was
not
a
designing
woman
but
although
we
are
discussing
men
as
all
women
know
there
are
really
no
men
at
all
there
are
boys
and
boys
and
elderly
boys
and
even
sometimes
very
old
boys
but
the
essential
difference
is
simply
exterior
your
man
is
always
a
boy
he
grows
tidier
and
he
gathers
up
a
mass
of
heterogeneous
information
and
in
the
strangest
possible
fashion
as
the
years
go
on
boards
have
to
be
put
into
the
table
and
the
shoe
bill
becomes
something
terrible
and
during
some
of
his
peregrinations
he
feels
rather
like
a
comet
with
a
tail
the
dentist
bills
and
where
to
go
for
the
summer
and
make
him
put
on
a
sort
of
surface
maturity
but
it
never
fools
his
womankind
deep
down
he
still
believes
in
santa
claus
and
would
like
to
get
up
at
dawn
on
the
fourth
of
july
and
throw
a
firecracker
through
the
cook
window
that
is
the
reason
women
are
natural
monogamists
they
know
they
have
to
be
women
because
the
one
man
is
so
always
a
boy
and
has
to
have
so
much
mothering
and
looking
after
he
has
to
be
watched
for
fear
his
hair
gets
too
long
and
sent
to
the
tailor
now
and
then
for
clothes
and
if
someone
did
turn
his
old
pajamas
into
scrub
rags
and
silver
cloths
he
would
go
on
wearing
their
ragged
skeletons
long
after
the
flesh
had
departed
hence
what
comforting
rags
irvin
cobb
pajamas
must
make
and
then
of
course
now
and
then
he
must
be
separated
forcibly
from
his
old
suits
and
shoes
the
best
method
as
every
woman
knows
is
to
give
them
to
someone
who
is
going
on
a
long
long
journey
else
he
will
follow
and
bring
them
back
in
triumph
this
fondness
for
what
is
old
is
a
strange
thing
in
men
it
does
not
apply
to
other
things
save
cheese
and
easy
chairs
and
some
kinds
of
game
and
drinkables
in
the
case
of
caps
boots
and
trousers
it
is
akin
to
mania
it
sometimes
applies
to
dress
waistcoats
and
evening
ties
but
has
one
of
its
greatest
exacerbations
beat
that
word
irvin
in
the
matter
of
dressing
gowns
if
by
any
chance
a
cigarette
has
burned
a
hole
in
the
dressing
gown
it
takes
on
the
additional
interest
of
survival
and
is
always
hung
hole
out
where
company
can
see
it
full
many
a
gentleman
returning
from
the
wars
has
found
that
his
heart
treasures
have
gone
to
rummage
sales
and
you
know
the
story
of
the
man
who
bought
his
dress
suit
back
for
cents
i
am
personally
acquainted
with
a
man
who
owns
a
number
of
pairs
of
bedroom
slippers
nice
leather
ones
velvet
ones
felt
ones
they
sit
in
a
long
row
in
his
closet
and
sit
and
sit
and
when
that
man
prepares
for
his
final
cigarette
at
night
and
to
drop
asleep
and
burn
another
hole
in
his
dressing
gown
or
in
the
chintz
chair
cover
or
the
carpet
as
providence
may
will
it
he
wears
on
his
feet
a
pair
of
red
knitted
bedroom
slippers
with
cords
that
tie
around
the
top
and
dangle
and
trip
him
up
long
years
ago
they
stretched
and
they
have
been
stretching
ever
since
until
now
each
one
resembles
an
afghan
will
he
give
them
up
he
will
not
there
is
something
feline
about
a
man
love
for
old
familiar
things
i
know
that
it
is
a
popular
misconception
to
compare
women
with
cats
and
men
with
dogs
but
the
analogy
is
clearly
the
other
way
just
run
over
the
cat
predominant
characteristic
and
check
them
off
the
cat
is
a
night
wanderer
the
cat
loves
familiar
places
and
the
hearthside
and
oddly
enough
the
cat
love
of
the
hearthside
interfere
with
his
night
wanderings
the
cat
can
hide
under
the
suavest
exterior
in
the
world
principles
that
would
make
a
kitten
blush
if
it
had
any
place
for
a
blush
the
cat
is
greedy
as
to
helpless
things
and
heavens
how
the
cat
likes
to
be
petted
and
generally
approved
it
likes
love
but
not
all
the
time
and
it
likes
to
choose
the
people
it
consorts
with
it
is
a
predatory
creature
also
and
likes
to
be
neat
and
tidy
while
it
sticks
to
its
old
trousers
with
a
love
that
passeth
understanding
there
i
slipped
up
but
you
know
what
i
mean
now
women
are
like
dogs
really
they
love
like
dogs
a
little
insistently
and
they
like
to
fetch
and
carry
and
come
back
wistfully
after
hard
words
and
learn
rather
easily
to
carry
a
basket
and
after
three
years
or
so
of
marriage
they
learn
to
enjoy
the
bones
of
conversation
and
sometimes
even
to
go
to
the
mat
with
them
oh
irvin
i
know
that
dreadful
really
the
only
resemblance
between
men
and
dogs
is
that
they
both
rather
run
to
feet
in
early
life
this
fondness
for
old
clothes
and
old
chairs
and
familiar
places
is
something
women
find
hard
to
understand
yet
it
is
simple
enough
it
is
compounded
of
comfort
and
loyalty
men
are
curiously
loyal
they
are
loyal
to
ancient
hats
and
disreputable
old
friends
and
to
some
women
but
they
are
always
loyal
to
each
other
this
i
maintain
is
the
sole
reason
for
alluding
to
them
as
the
stronger
and
superior
sex
they
are
stronger
they
are
superior
they
are
as
strong
as
a
trades
union
only
more
so
they
stand
together
against
the
rest
of
the
world
women
do
not
they
have
no
impulse
toward
solidarity
they
fight
a
sort
of
guerilla
warfare
each
sniping
from
behind
her
own
tree
they
are
the
greatest
example
of
the
weakness
of
unorganized
force
in
the
world
but
this
male
trades
union
is
not
due
to
affection
it
is
it
is
a
survival
from
the
days
when
men
united
for
defense
women
unite
they
did
need
to
and
they
could
have
anyhow
when
the
cave
man
went
away
to
fight
or
to
do
the
family
marketing
he
used
to
roll
a
large
bowlder
against
the
entrance
to
his
stone
mansion
and
thus
discouraged
afternoon
callers
of
the
feminine
sex
who
would
otherwise
have
dropped
in
for
a
cup
of
tea
then
he
took
away
the
rope
ladder
and
cut
off
the
telephone
and
went
away
with
a
heart
at
peace
to
join
the
other
males
they
would
do
it
now
if
they
could
but
the
real
reason
for
their
sex
solidarity
is
their
terrible
alikeness
they
understand
each
other
knowing
their
own
weaknesses
they
know
the
other
fellow
so
they
stand
by
each
other
sometimes
out
of
sympathy
and
occasionally
out
of
fear
you
see
it
is
not
only
a
trades
union
it
is
a
mutual
benefit
society
its
only
constitution
is
the
male
golden
rule
you
stick
by
me
and
i
stick
by
you
we
men
must
stick
together
i
confess
that
with
a
good
many
women
it
is
you
stick
me
and
stick
you
but
that
solidarity
primarily
offensive
and
defensive
has
also
an
element
in
it
that
women
seldom
understand
and
almost
always
resent
not
very
many
years
ago
a
play
ran
in
new
york
without
a
woman
in
the
cast
or
connected
with
the
story
there
is
one
running
very
successfully
now
in
paris
both
were
written
by
men
naturally
women
can
not
conceive
of
the
drama
of
life
without
women
in
it
but
men
can
the
plain
truth
is
that
normal
women
need
men
all
the
time
but
that
normal
men
need
women
only
a
part
of
the
time
they
like
to
have
them
to
go
back
to
but
they
do
not
need
them
in
sight
or
even
within
telephone
call
there
are
some
hours
of
every
day
when
you
could
repeat
a
wife
name
to
him
through
a
megaphone
and
he
would
have
to
come
a
long
ways
back
from
golf
or
pool
or
the
ticker
or
the
stock
news
to
remember
who
she
is
when
a
man
gets
up
a
golf
foursome
he
wants
four
men
when
a
woman
does
it
she
wants
three
it
is
this
ability
to
be
happy
without
her
that
a
woman
never
understands
her
lack
of
understanding
of
it
causes
a
good
bit
of
unhappiness
too
men
are
gregarious
they
like
to
be
together
but
women
gauge
them
by
their
own
needs
and
form
dark
surmises
about
these
harmless
meetings
which
are
as
innocuous
and
often
as
interesting
as
the
purely
companionable
huddlings
of
sheep
in
pasture
women
play
bridge
together
to
fill
in
the
time
until
the
is
due
men
play
bridge
because
they
like
to
beat
the
other
fellow
mind
you
i
am
not
saying
there
are
not
strong
and
fine
affections
among
women
if
it
comes
to
that
there
is
often
deeper
devotion
perhaps
than
among
men
but
i
am
saying
that
women
do
not
care
for
women
as
a
sex
as
men
care
for
men
men
will
die
to
save
other
men
women
will
sacrifice
themselves
ruthlessly
for
children
but
not
for
other
women
queer
is
it
yet
not
so
queer
women
want
marriage
and
a
home
they
should
and
there
are
more
women
than
men
even
before
the
war
there
was
in
europe
and
america
an
extra
sixth
woman
for
every
five
men
and
the
sixth
woman
brings
competition
she
bulls
the
market
and
makes
feminine
sex
solidarity
impossible
and
of
course
added
to
that
is
the
woman
who
requires
three
or
four
men
to
make
her
happy
one
to
marry
and
support
her
and
one
to
take
her
to
the
theater
and
to
luncheon
at
delmonico
and
generally
fetch
and
carry
for
her
and
one
to
remember
her
as
she
was
at
nineteen
and
remain
a
bachelor
and
have
a
selfish
delightful
life
while
blaming
her
this
makes
masculine
stock
still
higher
and
as
there
are
always
buyers
on
a
rising
market
competition
among
women
purely
unconscious
competition
flourishes
so
men
hang
together
and
women
do
and
men
are
the
stronger
sex
because
they
are
fewer
obviously
the
cure
is
the
elimination
of
that
sixth
woman
preferably
by
euthanasia
look
this
up
irvin
it
a
good
one
that
sixth
woman
ought
to
go
she
has
made
men
sought
and
not
seekers
she
ruins
dinner
parties
and
is
the
vampire
of
the
moving
pictures
and
after
living
a
respectable
life
for
years
she
either
goes
on
living
a
respectable
life
and
stays
with
her
sister
children
while
the
family
goes
on
a
motor
tour
or
takes
to
serving
instead
of
afternoon
tea
while
wearing
a
teagown
of
some
passionate
shade
it
is
just
possible
that
suffrage
will
bring
women
together
it
is
just
possible
that
male
opposition
has
in
it
this
subconscious
fear
that
their
superiority
is
thus
threatened
they
do
really
want
equality
you
know
they
love
to
patronize
us
a
bit
bless
them
and
to
tell
us
to
run
along
and
not
bother
our
little
heads
about
things
that
concern
us
and
of
course
politics
has
been
their
own
private
maneuvering
ground
and
i
have
made
it
clear
i
think
that
they
always
want
us
here
we
are
about
to
drill
on
it
ourselves
perhaps
drilling
a
mite
better
than
they
do
in
some
formations
and
standing
right
on
their
own
field
and
telling
them
the
mistakes
they
made
and
not
to
take
themselves
too
hard
and
that
the
whole
game
is
a
lot
easier
than
they
have
always
pretended
it
was
they
do
like
it
really
a
lot
of
them
their
solidarity
is
threatened
their
superiority
and
another
sanctuary
as
closed
to
women
as
a
monastery
or
a
club
is
invaded
no
place
to
go
but
home
yet
i
have
a
sneaking
sympathy
for
them
they
were
so
terribly
happy
running
things
and
fighting
wars
and
coming
back
at
night
to
throw
their
conversational
bones
around
the
table
it
is
rather
awful
to
think
of
them
coming
home
now
and
having
some
little
woman
say
certainly
we
are
not
going
to
the
movies
do
you
know
there
is
a
ward
caucus
there
is
a
curious
situation
in
the
economic
world
too
business
has
been
the
man
field
ever
since
cain
and
abel
went
into
the
stock
and
farming
combine
with
one
of
them
raising
grain
for
the
other
cows
and
taking
beef
in
exchange
and
the
novelty
is
gone
but
there
a
truism
here
men
play
harder
than
they
work
women
work
harder
than
they
play
women
in
business
bring
to
it
the
freshness
of
novelty
and
work
at
their
maximum
as
a
sex
men
being
always
boys
work
their
maximum
loud
screams
here
but
think
it
over
how
about
shaking
dice
at
the
club
after
lunch
and
wandering
back
to
the
office
at
three
to
sign
the
mail
how
about
golf
i
wager
i
work
more
hours
a
day
than
you
irvin
the
plain
truth
is
that
if
more
men
put
their
whole
hearts
into
business
during
business
hours
there
would
be
no
question
of
competition
as
i
have
said
they
think
straighter
than
women
although
more
slowly
they
have
more
physical
strength
they
do
have
sick
headaches
unless
they
deserve
them
but
they
are
vaguely
resentful
when
some
little
woman
who
has
washed
the
children
and
sent
them
off
to
school
and
straightened
her
house
and
set
out
a
cold
lunch
comes
into
the
office
at
nine
and
works
in
circles
all
around
them
but
there
is
another
angle
to
this
woman
in
the
business
world
idea
that
puzzles
women
not
long
ago
a
clever
woman
whose
husband
does
not
resent
her
working
since
his
home
and
children
are
well
looked
after
said
to
me
i
always
been
interested
in
what
he
had
to
say
of
his
day
at
the
office
but
he
does
seem
to
care
at
all
about
day
he
seems
so
awfully
the
truth
probably
is
that
they
are
both
but
women
can
dissemble
and
men
can
not
it
is
another
proof
of
their
invincible
boyishness
this
total
inability
to
pretend
interest
even
the
averagest
man
is
no
hypocrite
he
tries
it
sometimes
and
fails
pitifully
the
successful
male
dissembler
is
generally
a
crook
but
the
most
honest
woman
in
the
world
is
often
driven
to
pretense
although
she
may
call
it
she
pretends
because
pretense
is
the
oil
that
lubricates
society
have
you
ever
seen
a
man
when
some
neighbors
who
are
unpopular
drop
in
for
an
evening
call
after
they
are
gone
his
wife
says
i
do
wish
you
would
bite
the
andersons
when
they
come
in
joe
bite
them
i
was
civil
was
i
well
you
can
call
it
that
he
is
ready
to
examine
the
window
locks
but
he
turns
and
surveys
her
and
he
is
honestly
puzzled
what
i
ca
make
out
he
says
is
how
you
can
fall
all
over
yourself
to
those
people
when
you
know
you
detest
them
thank
heavens
i
no
hypocrite
then
he
locks
the
windows
and
stalks
and
the
hypocrite
of
the
family
smiles
a
little
to
herself
because
she
knows
that
without
her
there
would
be
no
society
and
no
neighborhood
calls
and
that
honesty
can
be
a
vice
and
hypocrisy
a
virtue
i
know
a
vestryman
of
a
church
who
sometimes
plays
bridge
on
saturday
nights
for
money
what
he
loses
does
matter
but
what
he
wins
his
wife
is
supposed
to
put
on
the
plate
the
next
morning
one
saturday
night
he
gave
her
a
large
bill
and
the
next
morning
she
placed
a
neatly
folded
on
the
collection
plate
as
he
held
it
out
to
her
he
stood
in
the
aisle
and
eyed
the
bill
with
suspicion
then
he
deliberately
unfolded
it
and
held
out
the
plate
to
her
again
come
over
mazie
he
said
and
mazie
came
over
with
the
balance
you
know
what
a
woman
would
have
done
she
would
have
marked
the
bill
with
her
eye
and
later
on
while
waiting
at
the
rear
for
the
chair
offertory
to
end
she
would
have
investigated
then
on
the
way
home
she
would
have
said
i
had
a
good
notion
to
stand
right
there
charlie
smith
and
show
you
up
i
wish
i
had
but
the
point
is
that
she
would
have
there
is
no
moral
whatever
to
this
brief
tale
but
perhaps
it
is
in
love
that
men
and
women
differ
most
vitally
now
nature
being
extremely
wise
gives
the
man
in
love
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
and
the
wile
of
the
dove
which
is
a
most
alluring
bird
in
its
a
man
in
love
brings
to
it
all
his
intelligence
and
men
like
being
in
love
being
in
love
is
not
so
happy
for
a
woman
she
becomes
emotional
and
difficult
is
either
on
the
heights
or
in
the
depths
and
the
reason
for
this
is
simple
love
is
a
complex
to
a
woman
she
has
to
contend
with
natural
and
acquired
inhibitions
she
both
desires
love
and
fears
it
the
primitive
woman
ran
away
from
her
lover
but
like
lot
wife
she
looked
back
i
am
inclined
to
think
however
that
primitive
woman
looked
back
rather
harder
than
she
ran
be
that
as
it
may
women
both
desire
love
and
fear
it
if
men
fear
it
they
successfully
hide
their
cowardice
it
is
in
their
methods
of
making
love
that
men
cease
to
be
alike
up
to
that
point
they
are
very
similar
they
all
think
that
having
purchased
an
automobile
they
must
vindicate
their
judgment
by
insisting
upon
its
virtues
and
a
great
many
of
them
will
spend
as
much
money
fixing
over
last
year
car
as
would
almost
buy
a
new
one
they
always
think
they
drive
carefully
but
that
the
fellow
in
the
other
car
is
either
a
road
hog
or
a
lunatic
who
should
have
a
license
they
are
mostly
rather
moody
before
breakfast
although
there
is
an
obnoxious
type
that
sings
in
the
cold
shower
they
are
all
rather
given
to
the
practice
of
bringing
gifts
to
their
wives
when
they
have
done
something
they
should
and
they
all
have
a
tendency
to
excuse
their
occasional
delinquencies
by
the
argument
that
they
never
made
anybody
unhappy
and
their
weaknesses
by
the
fact
that
god
made
them
men
but
it
is
in
love
that
they
are
at
their
best
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
one
woman
most
interested
and
it
is
in
their
love
methods
that
they
show
the
greatest
variations
from
type
certain
things
of
course
they
all
do
buy
new
neckties
write
letters
which
they
read
years
later
with
amazement
and
consternation
keep
a
photograph
in
a
drawer
of
the
desk
at
the
office
where
the
stenographer
finds
it
and
says
to
the
office
boy
can
you
beat
that
and
not
even
pretty
carry
boxes
of
candy
around
hoping
they
look
like
cigars
and
lie
awake
nights
wondering
what
she
can
see
in
him
and
wondering
if
she
is
awake
too
they
are
very
dear
and
very
humble
and
sheepish
and
when
they
are
in
love
curious
mixtures
of
determination
and
vacillation
about
eighty
per
cent
however
being
determination
but
they
lose
for
once
their
sex
solidarity
and
play
the
game
every
man
for
himself
roughly
speaking
although
who
can
speak
roughly
of
them
then
or
at
any
time
they
divide
into
three
types
of
lovers
there
are
men
who
are
all
three
at
different
times
of
course
but
these
three
classes
of
lovers
have
one
thing
in
common
they
want
to
do
their
own
hunting
it
gives
them
a
sense
of
power
to
think
they
have
won
out
by
sheer
strength
and
will
the
truth
about
this
is
that
no
man
ever
won
a
woman
who
was
actually
difficult
to
get
and
found
it
worth
the
effort
afterwards
what
real
man
ever
liked
kissing
a
girl
who
did
want
to
be
kissed
love
has
got
to
be
mutual
your
lover
is
frequently
more
interested
in
being
loved
than
in
loving
and
the
trump
cards
are
always
the
woman
these
boys
of
ours
are
shy
and
in
love
and
they
run
like
deer
when
they
think
they
are
not
wanted
so
the
woman
has
to
play
a
double
game
and
gets
blamed
for
guile
when
it
is
only
wisdom
her
instinct
is
to
run
partly
because
she
is
afraid
of
love
and
partly
because
she
has
to
appear
to
be
pursued
but
she
has
to
limp
a
bit
and
sit
down
and
look
back
rather
wistfully
and
in
the
end
of
course
she
goes
lame
entirely
and
is
overtaken
this
is
the
same
instinct
which
makes
the
pheasant
hen
feign
a
broken
wing
there
is
a
wonderful
type
of
woman
however
who
goes
as
straight
to
the
man
she
loves
as
a
homing
pigeon
to
its
loft
taking
then
the
three
classes
of
men
in
the
throes
of
the
disease
of
love
we
have
the
following
symptoms

and
prognosis
first
the

temperature

his
income
will
cover
a
house
and
garage
in
the
country
adding
the
cost
of
his
commutation
ticket
and
shows
tendency
to
look
rather
wistfully
into
toy
before
christmas
diagnosis
normal

prognosis
probably
permanent

second
the
fearful
lover
temperature
inclined
to
be
at
times
physical
type
a
hulking
brute
of
a
man
liking
small
women
only
he
feels
coarse
and
rather
gross
when
with
them
he
is
the
physical
type
generally
attributed
to
the
cave
man
but
this
is
an
error
see
cave
man
later
his
timidity
is
not
physical
but
mental
and
is
referable
by
the
freud

taught
that
big
overgrown

it
off
on
sunday
afternoons
telephones
with
gentle
persistence
and
prefers
the
movies
to
the
theater
because
they
are
dark
this
type
sometimes
loses
its
gentleness
after
marriage
and
always
has
an
ideal
woman
in
mind
some
one
who
walks
like
pauline

normal
love
with

prognosis
a
large
family
of
daughters
a
great
many
women
believe
that
they
can
change
men
by
marrying
them
this
is
a
mistake
women
make
it
because
they
themselves
are
pliable
but
the
male
is
firmly
fixed
at
the
age
of
six
years
and
remains
fundamentally
the
same
thereafter
the
only
way
to
make
a
husband
over
according
to
one
ideas
then
would
be
to
adopt
him
at
an
early
age
say
four
but
who
really
wants
to
change
them
where
would
be
the
interest
in
marriage
to
tell
the
truth
we
like
their
weaknesses
it
gives
women
that
entirely
private
conviction
they
have
that
john
would
make
an
utter
mess
of
things
if
they
were
not
around
men
know
better
how
to
live
than
women
the
average
man
gets
more
out
of
life
than
the
average
woman
he
compounds
his
days
if
he
be
a
healthy
normal
individual
of
work
and
play
and
his
play
generally
takes
the
form
of
fresh
air
and
exercise
he
has
frequently
more
real
charity
than
his
womankind
and
by
charity
i
mean
an
understanding
of
human
weakness
and
a
tolerance
of
frailty
he
may
dislike
his
neighbors
heartily
and
snub
them
in
prosperity
but
in
trouble
he
is
quick
with
practical
assistance
and
although
often
tactless
for
tact
and
extreme
honesty
are
incompatible
he
is
usually
kind
there
is
often
a
selfish
purpose
behind
his
altruism
his
broad
charitable
organizations
but
to
individual
cases
of
distress
he
is
generous
unselfish
and
sacrificing
in
politics
he
is
individually
honest
as
a
rule
but
collectively
corrupt
and
this
strange
and
disheartening
fact
is
due
to
lethargy
he
is
politically
indolent
so
he
allows
the
few
to
rule
and
this
few
is
too
frequently
in
political
life
for
what
it
can
get
and
not
what
it
can
give
sins
of
omission
may
be
grave
sins
yet
he
is
individually
honest
in
politics
and
in
most
things
and
that
partly
at
least
is
because
pretty
much
overlaid
with
worldliness
he
has
a
deep
religious
conviction
but
he
has
a
terrible
fear
of
letting
anyone
know
he
has
it
indeed
he
is
shamefaced
about
all
his
emotions
he
would
sooner
wear
two
odd
shoes
than
weep
at
a
funeral
really
this
article
could
run
on
forever
there
that
particularly
manlike
attitude
of
accusing
women
of
slavishly
following
the
fashions
funny
is
it
when
you
think
about
it
do
you
think
a
man
would
wear
a
striped
tie
with
a
morning
coat
when
his
haberdasher
says
others
are
wearing
plain
gray
or
a
straw
hat
before
the
fifteenth
of
may
have
you
ever
watched
the
mental
struggle
between
a
dinner
suit
and
evening
clothes
do
you
suppose
that
women
realizing
that
the
costume
they
wore
was
the
ugliest
ever
devised
would
continue
wearing
it
because
everyone
else
did
and
then
look
at
men
trousers
and
derby
hats
it
is
men
who
are
the
slaves
double
chained
of
fashion
the
only
comfortable
innovation
in
men
clothes
made
in
a
century
was
when
some
brave
spirit
originated
the
shirtwaist
man
women
saw
its
comfort
adopted
and
retained
the
shirtwaist
but
the
leaders
of
male
fashion
dictated
that
comfort
was
bad
form
and
on
went
all
the
coats
again
irvin
cobb
is
undoubtedly
going
to
say
that
it
is
just
like
a
woman
to
wear
no
flannels
in
winter
and
silk
hose
and
generally
go
about
half
clad
but
men
are
as
in
summer
as
women
are
in
winter
but
in
spite
of
this
slavish
following
of
fashion
men
are
really
more
rational
than
women
they
have
the
same
mental
processes
for
that
reason
they
understand
each
other
like
the
village
fool
who
found
the
lost
horse
by
thinking
where
he
would
go
if
he
were
a
horse
a
man
knows
what
another
man
will
do
by
fancying
himself
in
the
same
circumstances
and
women
are
called
designing
because
they
have
fathomed
this
fundamental
simplicity
of
the
male
a
woman
emotions
and
her
sensations
and
her
thoughts
are
all
complexes
she
does
know
herself
what
she
is
going
to
do
and
is
frequently
more
astounded
than
anyone
else
at
what
she
does
do
it
a
lot
harder
being
a
woman
than
a
man
so
women
know
men
better
than
men
know
women
and
are
rather
like
the
little
boy
definition
of
a
friend
a
friend
is
a
feller
who
knows
all
about
you
and
likes
you
anyhow
we
do
like
them
dreadfully
sometimes
women
have
sighed
and
wondered
what
the
house
would
be
like
without
overcoats
thrown
about
in
the
hall
and
every
closet
full
of
beloved
old
ragged
clothes
and
shoes
and
cigar
ashes
over
things
and
wild
cries
for
the
ancient
hat
they
gave
the
gardener
last
week
to
weed
in
but
quite
recently
the
women
of
this
country
and
a
lot
of
other
countries
have
found
out
what
even
temporary
absence
means
a
house
without
a
man
in
it
is
as
nice
and
tidy
and
peaceful
and
attractive
and
cheerful
as
a
grave
in
a
cemetery
it
is
as
pleasant
as
mark
twain
celebrated
combination
of
rheumatism
and
vitus
dance
and
as
empty
as
a
chocolate
machine
in
a
railway
station
not
so
very
long
ago
there
was
a
drawing
in
one
of
the
magazines
it
showed
a
row
of
faces
men
with
hooked
noses
with
cauliflower
ears
with
and
flat
faces
with
smallpox
scars
with
hare
lips
and
underneath
it
said
never
mind
every
one
of
them
is
darling
women
do
really
care
how
their
men
look
but
they
want
to
look
up
to
them
which
is
a
reason
i
have
given
before
for
their
sex
superiority
it
is
really
forced
on
them
and
they
want
them
kind
and
even
a
bit
patronizing
also
they
want
them
because
a
sick
man
can
come
the
closest
thing
in
the
world
to
biting
the
hand
that
feeds
him
and
loyal
of
course
and
not
too
tidy
and
to
be
hungry
at
meals
and
not
to
be
too
bitter
about
going
out
in
the
evenings
and
the
one
thing
they
do
not
want
is
to
have
their
men
know
how
well
they
understand
them
it
is
one
of
their
pet
conceits
this
being
misunderstood
it
has
survived
from
the
time
of
that
early
punishment
when
each
and
every
one
of
them
contemplated
running
off
and
going
to
sea
most
of
them
still
contemplate
that
running
off
they
visualize
great
spaces
and
freedom
and
tropic
isles
and
well
you
know
where
there
ai
no
ten
commandments
and
a
man
can
raise
a
thirst
you
know
irvin
yes
they
contemplate
it
every
now
and
then
and
then
they
go
home
and
put
on
a
fresh
collar
for
dinner
and
examine
the
vegetable
garden
and
take
the
children
out
in
the
machine
for
a
few
minutes
fresh
air
and
have
a
pillow
fight
in
the
nursery
and
forget
the
other
thing
which
is
exactly
like
a
man
will
probably
forget
small
attentions
to
his
wife
after
marriage
will
always
remember
small
attentions
to
his
wife
after
marriage
especially
when
conscience
troubles
him
receives
constant
attention
from
his
family
after
marriage
