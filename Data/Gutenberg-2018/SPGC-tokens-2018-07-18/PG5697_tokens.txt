in
the
saloon
bar
of
a
situated
only
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
official
frontier
of
chinatown
two
men
sat
at
a
small
table
in
a
corner
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
they
afforded
a
sharp
contrast
one
was
a
and
rather
ruffianly
looking
fellow
not
too
cleanly
in
either
person
or
clothing
and
amongst
other
evidences
that
at
one
time
he
had
known
the
prize
ring
possessing
a
badly
broken
nose
his
companion
was
dressed
with
that
spruceness
which
belongs
to
the
successful
east
end
jew
he
was
cleanly
shaven
of
slight
build
and
alert
in
manner
and
address
having
ordered
and
paid
for
two
whiskies
and
sodas
the
jew
raising
his
glass
nodded
to
his
companion
and
took
a
drink
the
glitter
of
a
magnificent
diamond
which
he
wore
seemed
to
attract
the
attention
almost
hypnotically
cheerio
freddy
said
the
man
any
news
nothing
much
returned
the
one
addressed
as
freddy
setting
his
glass
upon
the
table
and
selecting
a
cigarette
from
a
packet
which
he
carried
in
his
pocket
i
not
so
sure
growled
the
other
watching
him
suspiciously
been
lying
low
for
a
long
time
and
it
not
like
you
to
slack
off
except
when
there
something
big
in
hm
said
his
companion
lighting
his
cigarette
what
do
you
mean
exactly
jim
poland
for
such
was
the
big
man
name
growled
and
spat
reflectively
into
a
spittoon
i
had
my
eye
on
you
freddy
he
replied
i
had
my
eye
on
you
oh
have
you
murmured
the
other
but
tell
me
what
you
mean
beneath
his
suave
manner
lay
a
threat
and
indeed
freddy
cohen
known
to
his
associates
as
diamond
fred
was
in
many
ways
a
formidable
personality
he
had
brought
to
his
chosen
profession
of
crook
a
american
training
together
with
all
that
mental
agility
and
cleverness
which
belong
to
his
race
and
was
at
once
an
object
of
envy
and
admiration
amongst
the
fraternity
which
keeps
scotland
yard
busy
jim
poland
physically
a
more
dangerous
character
was
not
in
the
same
class
with
him
but
he
was
not
without
brains
of
a
sort
and
cohen
although
smiling
agreeably
waited
with
some
anxiety
for
his
reply
i
mean
growled
poland
that
you
not
wasting
your
time
with
lala
huang
for
perhaps
not
returned
cohen
lightly
she
a
pretty
girl
but
what
business
is
it
of
yours
none
at
all
i
ai
interested
in
good
looks
neither
are
cohen
shrugged
and
raised
his
glass
again
come
on
growled
poland
leaning
across
the
table
i
know
and
i
in
on
it
d
hear
me
i
in
on
it
these
are
hard
times
and
we
got
to
stick
oh
said
cohen
that
the
game
is
it
that
the
game
right
enough
you
wo
go
wrong
if
you
bring
me
in
even
at
because
maybe
i
know
things
about
old
huang
that
you
do
the
jew
expression
changed
subtly
and
beneath
his
drooping
lids
he
glanced
aside
at
the
speaker
then
it
no
promise
he
said
but
what
do
you
know
poland
bent
farther
over
the
table
chinatown
being
watched
again
i
heard
this
morning
that
red
kerry
was
down
cohen
laughed
red
kerry
he
echoed
red
kerry
means
nothing
in
my
young
life
do
returned
jim
snarling
viciously
the
way
he
cleaned
up
that
dope
crowd
awhile
back
seemed
to
show
he
was
no
jug
did
it
the
jew
made
a
facial
gesture
as
if
to
dismiss
the
subject
all
right
continued
poland
think
that
way
if
you
like
but
the
patrols
have
been
doubled
i
suppose
you
know
that
and
it
a
cert
there
are
special
men
on
duty
ever
since
the
death
of
that
cohen
shifted
uneasily
glancing
about
him
in
a
furtive
fashion
see
what
i
mean
continued
the
other
chinatown
ai
healthy
just
he
finished
his
whisky
at
a
draught
and
standing
up
lurched
heavily
across
to
the
counter
he
returned
with
two
more
glasses
then
reseating
himself
and
bending
forward
again
there
one
thing
i
reckon
you
do
know
he
whispered
in
ear
i
saw
that
chink
talking
to
lala
huang
only
a
week
before
the
time
he
was
hauled
out
of
limehouse
reach
i
wondering
diamond
if
with
all
your
cleverness
you
may
not
go
the
same
do
try
to
pull
the
creep
stuff
on
me
jim
said
cohen
uneasily
what
are
you
driving
at
anyway
well
replied
poland
sipping
his
whisky
reflectively
how
did
that
chink
get
into
the
river
how
the
devil
do
i
know
and
what
killed
him
it
was
drowning
although
he
was
all
swelled
see
here
old
pal
said
cohen
i
know
better
than
you
know
limehouse
let
me
tell
you
that
this
little
old
chinatown
of
yours
is
pie
to
me
you
trying
to
get
me
figuring
on
chinese
death
traps
secret
poisons
and
all
that
junk
boy
you
wasting
your
poetry
even
if
you
did
see
the
chink
with
lala
and
i
doubt
it
oh
get
excited
i
speaking
plain
there
no
connection
that
i
can
see
between
the
death
of
said
chink
and
old
huang
ai
there
growled
poland
huskily
he
grasped
the
other
wrist
as
in
a
vise
and
bent
forward
so
that
his
battered
face
was
close
to
the
pale
countenance
of
the
jew
i
been
covering
old
huang
for
months
and
months
now
i
going
to
tell
you
something
since
the
death
of
that
chink
red
kerry
been
covering
him
see
here
cohen
withdrew
his
arm
from
the
other
grasp
angrily
you
ca
freeze
me
out
of
this
claim
with
bogey
stuff
you
listed
my
lad
and
you
know
it
chief
inspector
kerry
is
your
pet
nightmare
but
if
he
walked
in
here
right
now
i
could
ask
him
to
have
a
drink
i
would
but
i
could
you
got
the
wrong
angle
jim
lala
likes
me
fine
and
although
she
does
say
much
what
she
does
say
is
straight
i
ask
her
about
the
then
you
be
a
damned
what
that
i
say
you
be
a
damned
fool
i
warning
you
freddy
there
are
chinks
and
chinks
all
the
boys
know
old
huang
chow
has
got
a
regular
gold
mine
buried
somewhere
under
the
floor
but
all
the
boys
do
know
what
i
know
and
it
seems
that
you
do
what
is
that
jim
poland
bent
forward
more
urgently
again
seizing
cohen
wrist
and
huang
chow
is
a
mighty
big
bug
amongst
the
chinese
he
whispered
glancing
cautiously
about
him
he
hellish
clever
and
rotten
with
money
a
man
like
that
wants
handling
i
not
telling
you
what
i
know
but
call
it
and
maybe
you
come
out
the
brow
of
diamond
fred
displayed
beads
of
perspiration
and
with
a
blue
silk
handkerchief
which
he
carried
in
his
breast
pocket
he
delicately
dried
his
forehead
you
an
old
hand
at
this
stuff
jim
he
muttered
it
amounts
to
this
i
suppose
that
if
i
do
agree
you
queer
my
game
jim
poland
brow
lowered
and
he
clenched
his
fists
formidably
then
listen
he
said
in
his
hoarse
voice
it
ai
your
claim
any
more
than
mine
you
covered
it
different
that
all
yours
was
always
the
petticoat
lay
mine
slower
but
safer
is
anyone
else
in
with
you
then
we
double
up
now
i
tell
you
something
i
was
backing
what
you
were
going
to
quit
i
why
because
the
thing
too
dead
easy
and
a
thing
like
that
always
looks
like
hell
to
freddy
cohen
finished
his
glass
of
whisky
wait
while
i
get
some
more
drinks
he
said
in
this
way
then
at
about
the
hour
of
ten
on
a
stuffy
autumn
night
in
the
crowded
bar
of
that
wapping
these
two
made
a
compact
and
of
its
outcome
and
of
the
next
appearance
of
cohen
the
cracksman
within
the
ken
of
man
i
shall
now
proceed
to
tell
ii
the
end
of
cohen
i
been
expecting
this
said
chief
inspector
kerry
he
tilted
his
bowler
hat
farther
forward
over
his
brow
and
contemplated
the
ghastly
exhibit
which
lay
upon
the
slab
of
the
mortuary
two
other
police
officers
one
in
uniform
were
present
and
they
treated
the
celebrated
chief
inspector
with
the
deference
which
he
had
not
only
earned
but
had
always
demanded
from
his
subordinates
earmarked
for
important
promotion
he
was
an
interesting
figure
as
he
stood
there
in
the
gloomy
place
his
pose
that
of
an
athlete
about
to
perform
a
long
jump
or
perhaps
as
it
might
have
appeared
to
some
that
of
a
about
to
demonstrate
a
new
step
his
hair
was
brilliantly
red
and
so
was
his
short
wiry
aggressive
moustache
he
was
ruddy
of
complexion
and
he
looked
out
unblinkingly
upon
the
world
with
a
pair
of
eyes
neat
he
was
to
spruceness
and
while
of
no
more
than
medium
height
he
had
the
shoulders
of
an
acrobat
the
detective
who
stood
beside
him
by
name
john
durham
had
one
trait
in
common
with
his
celebrated
superior
this
was
a
quick
keenness
a
sort
of
alert
vitality
which
showed
in
his
eyes
and
indeed
in
every
line
of
his
thin
face
kerry
had
picked
him
out
as
the
most
promising
junior
in
his
department
give
me
the
particulars
said
the
chief
inspector
it
is
robbery
he
wearing
a
diamond
ring
worth
two
hundred
his
diction
was
rapid
and
terse
so
rapid
as
to
create
the
impression
that
he
bit
off
the
ends
of
the
longer
words
he
turned
his
fierce
blue
eyes
upon
the
uniformed
officer
who
stood
at
the
end
of
the
slab
they
are
very
few
chief
inspector
was
the
reply
he
was
hauled
out
by
the
river
police
shortly
after
midnight
at
the
lower
end
of
limehouse
reach
he
was
alive
then
they
heard
his
cry
but
he
died
while
they
were
hauling
him
into
the
any
statement
rapped
kerry
he
was
past
it
chief
inspector
according
to
the
report
of
the
officer
in
charge
he
mumbled
something
which
sounded
like
has
bitten
me
just
before
he
became
has
bitten
me
murmured
kerry
the
divisional
surgeon
has
seen
him
yes
chief
inspector
and
in
his
opinion
the
man
did
not
die
from
drowning
but
from
some
form
of
virulent
poisoning
that
the
idea
there
will
be
a
further
examination
of
course
either
a
hypodermic
injection
or
a
a
bite
said
kerry
the
bite
of
what
that
i
can
not
say
chief
inspector
a
venomous
reptile
i
kerry
stared
down
critically
at
the
swollen
face
of
the
victim
and
then
glanced
sharply
aside
at
durham
accounts
for
his
appearance
i
suppose
he
murmured
yes
said
durham
quietly
he
had
been
in
the
water
long
enough
to
look
like
he
turned
to
the
local
officer
is
there
any
theory
as
to
the
point
at
which
he
went
in
well
an
arrest
has
been
by
whom
of
whom
rapped
kerry
two
constables
patrolling
the
chinatown
area
arrested
a
man
for
suspicious
loitering
he
turned
out
to
be
a
criminal
jim
poland
with
a
whole
list
of
convictions
against
him
they
holding
him
at
limehouse
station
and
the
theory
is
that
he
was
operating
with
he
nodded
in
the
direction
of
the
body
then
who
the
smart
with
the
swollen
face
inquired
kerry
he
a
new
one
on
yes
but
he
been
identified
by
one
of
the
k
division
men
he
is
an
american
crook
with
a
clean
slate
so
far
as
this
side
is
concerned
cohen
is
his
name
and
the
idea
seems
to
be
that
he
went
in
at
some
point
between
where
he
was
found
by
the
river
police
and
the
point
at
which
jim
poland
was
kerry
snapped
his
teeth
together
audibly
and
i
open
to
learn
he
said
that
the
house
of
huang
chow
is
within
that
it
i
thought
so
he
died
the
same
way
the
chinaman
died
awhile
ago
snapped
kerry
savagely
it
looks
very
he
glanced
aside
at
the
local
officer
cover
him
up
he
ordered
and
turning
he
walked
briskly
out
of
the
mortuary
followed
by
detective
durham
although
dawn
was
not
far
off
this
was
the
darkest
hour
of
the
night
so
that
even
the
sounds
of
dockland
were
muted
and
the
riverside
slept
as
deeply
as
the
great
port
of
london
ever
sleeps
vague
murmurings
there
were
and
distant
clankings
with
the
hum
of
machinery
which
is
never
still
few
of
london
millions
were
awake
at
that
hour
yet
scotland
yard
was
awake
in
the
person
of
the
chief
inspector
and
his
subordinate
perhaps
those
who
lightly
criticize
the
metropolitan
force
might
have
learned
a
new
respect
for
the
tireless
vigilance
which
keeps
london
clean
and
wholesome
had
they
witnessed
this
scene
on
the
borders
of
limehouse
as
kerry
stepping
into
a
waiting
accompanied
by
durham
proceeded
to
limehouse
police
station
in
that
still
hour
when
the
city
slept
the
arrival
of
kerry
created
something
of
a
stir
amongst
the
officials
on
duty
his
reputation
in
these
days
was
at
least
as
great
as
that
of
the
most
garrulous
labour
member
the
prisoner
was
in
cells
but
the
chief
inspector
elected
to
interview
him
in
the
office
and
accordingly
while
the
officer
in
charge
sat
at
an
extremely
tidy
tapping
the
with
a
pencil
and
detective
john
durham
stood
beside
him
kerry
paced
up
and
down
the
little
room
deep
in
reflection
until
the
door
opened
and
the
prisoner
was
brought
in
one
swift
glance
the
chief
inspector
gave
at
the
face
and
recognized
instantly
that
this
was
a
badly
frightened
man
crossing
to
the
table
he
took
up
a
typewritten
slip
which
lay
there
and
your
name
is
james
poland
he
said
four
convictions
one
robbery
with
jim
poland
nodded
sullenly
you
were
arrested
at
the
corner
of
pekin
street
about
midnight
what
were
you
doing
there
taking
a
i
say
it
again
rapped
kerry
fixing
his
fierce
eyes
upon
the
face
what
were
you
doing
there
i
told
and
i
tell
you
you
a
liar
where
did
you
leave
the
man
cohen
poland
blinked
his
small
eyes
cleared
his
throat
and
looked
down
at
the
floor
uneasily
then
who
cohen
he
grunted
you
mean
who
was
cohen
cried
kerry
the
shot
went
home
the
man
clenched
his
fists
and
looked
about
the
room
from
face
to
face
you
do
tell
me
he
began
huskily
i
told
you
said
kerry
he
on
the
slab
spit
out
the
truth
it
be
good
for
your
the
man
hesitated
then
looked
up
his
eyes
half
closed
and
a
cunning
expression
upon
his
face
make
out
your
own
case
he
said
you
got
nothing
against
kerry
snapped
his
teeth
together
viciously
i
told
you
what
happened
to
your
pal
he
warned
if
you
a
wise
man
you
come
in
on
our
side
before
the
same
thing
happens
to
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
growled
poland
kerry
nodded
to
the
constable
at
the
doorway
take
him
back
he
ordered
jim
poland
being
returned
to
his
cell
kerry
as
the
door
closed
behind
the
prisoner
and
his
guard
stared
across
at
durham
where
he
stood
beside
the
table
an
old
hand
he
said
but
there
another
he
glanced
at
the
officer
in
charge
hold
him
till
the
morning
he
prove
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
he
took
out
a
slip
of
chewing
gum
unwrapped
it
and
placed
the
wafer
between
his
large
white
teeth
he
bit
upon
it
savagely
settled
his
hat
upon
his
head
and
turning
walked
toward
the
door
in
the
doorway
he
paused
come
with
me
durham
he
said
i
am
leaving
the
conduct
of
the
case
entirely
in
your
hands
from
now
detective
durham
looked
surprised
and
not
a
little
anxious
i
am
doing
so
for
two
reasons
continued
the
chief
inspector
these
two

now
iii
the
secret
unlike
its
sister
colony
in
new
york
there
are
no
show
places
in
limehouse
the
visitor
sees
nothing
but
mean
streets
and
dark
doorways
the
superficial
inquirer
comes
away
convinced
that
the
romance
of
the
asiatic
district
has
no
existence
outside
the
imaginations
of
writers
of
fiction
yet
here
lies
a
secret
quarter
as
secret
and
as
strange
in
its
smaller
way
as
its
parent
in
china
which
is
called
the
purple
forbidden
city
on
a
morning
when
mist
lay
over
the
thames
reaches
softening
the
harshness
of
the
dock
buildings
and
lending
an
air
of
mystery
to
the
vessels
stealing
out
upon
the
tide
a
man
walked
briskly
along
limehouse
causeway
looking
about
him
inquiringly
as
one
unfamiliar
with
the
neighbourhood
presently
he
seemed
to
recognize
a
turning
to
the
right
and
he
pursued
this
for
a
time
now
walking
more
slowly
a
european
woman
holding
a
baby
in
her
arms
stood
in
an
open
doorway
watching
him
uninterestedly
otherwise
except
for
one
neatly
dressed
young
chinaman
who
passed
him
about
halfway
along
the
street
there
was
nothing
which
could
have
told
the
visitor
that
he
had
crossed
the
borderline
dividing
west
from
east
and
was
now
in
an
oriental
town
a
very
narrow
alleyway
between
two
dingy
houses
proved
to
be
the
spot
for
which
he
was
looking
and
having
stared
about
him
for
a
while
he
entered
this
alleyway
at
the
farther
end
it
was
crossed
by
another
alley
the
only
object
of
interest
being
an
iron
post
at
the
crossing
and
the
scenery
being
made
up
entirely
of
hideous
brick
walls
about
halfway
along
on
the
left
set
in
one
of
these
walls
were
strong
wooden
gates
apparently
those
of
a
warehouse
beside
them
was
a
door
approached
by
two
very
dirty
steps
there
was
a
near
the
door
but
upon
neither
of
these
entrances
was
there
any
plate
to
indicate
the
name
of
the
proprietor
of
the
establishment
from
his
the
visitor
extracted
a
card
consulted
something
written
upon
it
and
then
pressed
the
bell
it
was
very
quiet
in
this
dingy
little
court
no
sound
of
the
busy
thoroughfares
penetrated
here
and
although
the
passage
forming
the
top
of
the
t
practically
marked
the
river
bank
only
dimly
could
one
discern
the
sounds
which
belong
to
a
seaport
presently
the
door
was
opened
by
a
chinese
boy
who
wore
the
ordinary
native
working
dress
and
who
regarded
the
man
upon
the
step
with
oblique
eyes
mr
huang
chow
asked
the
caller
the
boy
nodded
you
wantchee
him
see
if
he
is
at
the
boy
glanced
at
the
card
which
the
visitor
still
held
between
finger
and
thumb
and
extended
his
hand
silently
the
card
was
surrendered
it
was
that
of
an
antique
dealer
of
dover
street
piccadilly
and
written
upon
the
back
was
the
following
mr
hampden
would
like
to
do
business
with
the
signature
of
the
dealer
followed
the
boy
turned
and
passed
along
a
dim
and
perfectly
unfurnished
passage
which
the
opening
of
the
door
had
revealed
while
hampden
stood
upon
the
step
and
lighted
a
cigarette
in
less
than
a
minute
the
boy
returned
and
beckoned
to
him
to
come
in
as
he
did
so
and
the
door
was
closed
he
almost
stumbled
so
dark
was
the
passage
presently
guided
by
the
boy
he
found
himself
in
a
very
little
office
where
a
girl
sat
at
an
american
desk
looking
up
at
him
inquiringly
she
was
of
a
dark
and
arresting
type
without
being
pretty
in
the
european
sense
there
was
something
appealing
in
her
fine
dark
eyes
and
she
possessed
the
inviting
smile
which
is
the
heritage
of
eastern
women
her
dress
was
not
unlike
that
of
any
other
business
girl
except
that
the
neck
of
her
blouse
was
cut
very
low
a
fashion
affected
by
many
eurasians
and
she
wore
a
gaily
coloured
sash
and
large
and
very
costly
pearl
as
hampden
paused
in
the
doorway
good
morning
said
the
girl
glancing
down
at
the
card
which
lay
upon
the
desk
before
her
you
come
from
isaacs
eh
she
looked
at
him
with
a
caressing
glance
from
beneath
lashes
but
missed
no
detail
of
his
appearance
she
did
not
quite
like
his
moustache
and
thought
that
he
would
have
looked
better
cleanshaven
nevertheless
he
was
a
fellow
and
her
manner
evidenced
approval
yes
he
replied
smiling
genially
i
have
a
small
commission
to
execute
and
i
am
told
that
you
can
help
the
girl
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
yes
very
likely
she
said
speaking
good
english
but
with
an
odd
intonation
it
is
not
jade
we
have
very
little
no
no
i
wanted
an
enamelled
what
kind
cloisonne
yes
we
have
she
pressed
a
bell
and
glancing
up
at
the
boy
who
had
stood
throughout
the
interview
at
the
visitor
elbow
addressed
him
rapidly
in
chinese
he
nodded
his
head
and
led
the
way
through
a
second
doorway
closing
this
he
opened
a
third
and
ushered
hampden
into
a
room
which
nearly
caused
the
latter
to
gasp
with
astonishment
one
who
had
blundered
from
whitechapel
into
the
khan
khalil
who
had
been
transported
upon
a
magic
carpet
from
a
tube
station
to
the
taj
mahal
or
dropped
suddenly
upon
lebanon
hills
to
find
himself
looking
down
upon
the
pearly
domes
and
jewelled
gardens
of
damascus
could
not
well
have
been
more
surprised
this
great
of
old
huang
chow
was
one
of
chinatown
secrets
a
secret
shared
only
by
those
whose
commercial
interests
were
identical
with
the
interests
of
huang
chow
the
place
was
artificially
lighted
by
lamps
which
themselves
were
beautiful
objects
of
art
and
which
swung
from
the
massive
beams
of
the
ceiling
the
floor
of
the
warehouse
which
was
partly
of
stone
was
covered
with
thick
matting
and
spread
upon
it
were
rugs
and
carpets
of
karadagh
kermanshah
and
khorassan
with
loomings
of
almost
equal
beauty
skins
of
rare
beasts
overlay
the
divans
furniture
of
ivory
of
ebony
and
lemonwood
preciously
inlaid
gave
to
the
place
an
air
of
cunning
confusion
there
were
tall
cabinets
there
were
caskets
and
chests
of
exquisite
lacquer
and
enamel
loot
of
an
emperor
palace
robes
heavy
with
gold
slippers
studded
with
jewels
strange
carven
ivories
glittering
weapons
pots
jars
and
bowls
as
delicate
and
as
fragile
as
the
petals
of
a
lily
last
but
not
least
sitting
upon
a
low
couch
was
old
huang
chow
smoking
a
great
curved
pipe
and
peering
half
blindly
across
the
place
through
large
spectacles
this
couch
was
set
immediately
beside
a
wide
ascending
staircase
richly
carpeted
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
staircase
in
a
corresponding
recess
upon
a
gilded
trestle
carved
to
represent
the
four
claws
of
a
dragon
rested
perhaps
the
strangest
exhibit
of
that
strange
collection
a
chinese
coffin
of
exquisite
workmanship
the
boy
retired
and
hampden
found
himself
alone
with
huang
chow
no
word
had
been
exchanged
between
master
and
servant
but
good
morning
hampden
said
the
chinaman
in
a
high
thin
voice
please
be
seated
it
is
from
isaacs
you
come
iv
personal
report
of
detective
john
durham
to
chief
inspector
kerry
officer
in
charge
of
limehouse
inquiry
dear
chief
inspector
following
your
instructions
i
returned
and
interviewed
the
prisoner
poland
in
his
cell
i
took
the
line
which
you
had
suggested
pointing
out
to
him
that
he
had
nothing
to
gain
and
everything
to
lose
by
keeping
silent
answer
my
questions
i
said
and
you
can
walk
straight
out
otherwise
you
be
up
before
the
magistrate
and
on
your
record
alone
it
will
mean
a
holiday
which
you
probably
do
he
was
very
truculent
but
i
got
him
in
a
good
humour
at
last
and
he
admitted
that
he
had
been
cooperating
with
the
dead
man
cohen
in
an
attempt
to
burgle
the
house
of
huang
chow
his
reluctance
to
go
into
details
seemed
to
be
due
rather
to
fear
of
huang
chow
than
to
fear
of
the
law
and
i
presently
gathered
that
he
regarded
huang
as
responsible
for
the
death
not
only
of
cohen
but
also
of
the
chinaman
who
was
hauled
out
of
the
river
about
three
weeks
ago
as
you
well
remember
the
showed
that
he
had
died
of
some
kind
of
poisoning
and
when
we
saw
cohen
in
the
mortuary
his
swollen
appearance
struck
me
as
being
very
similar
to
that
of
the
chinaman
see
my
report
dated
ultimo
he
finally
agreed
to
talk
if
i
would
promise
that
he
should
not
be
charged
and
that
his
name
should
never
be
mentioned
to
anyone
in
connection
with
what
he
might
tell
me
i
promised
him
that
outside
the
ordinary
official
routine
i
would
respect
his
request
and
he
told
me
some
very
curious
things
which
no
doubt
have
a
bearing
on
the
case
for
instance
he
had
discovered
i
do
know
in
what
way
that
the
dead
chinaman
whose
name
was
pi
lung
had
been
in
negotiation
with
huang
chow
for
some
sort
of
job
in
his
warehouse
poland
had
seen
the
man
talking
to
huang
daughter
at
the
end
of
the
alley
which
leads
to
the
place
he
seemed
to
attach
extraordinary
importance
to
this
fact
at
last
i
tell
you
what
it
is
he
said
that
chink
was
a
stranger
to
limehouse
i
can
swear
to
it
he
was
a
gent
of
his
hands
i
reckon
they
got
in
china
as
well
as
here
he
went
out
for
the
old
and
finished
like
cohen
make
your
meaning
clearer
i
said
my
meaning
this
old
huang
chow
is
the
biggest
dealer
in
stolen
and
smuggled
valuables
from
overseas
we
got
in
london
he
something
else
as
well
he
a
big
swell
in
china
but
here
the
point
got
business
with
buyers
all
over
london
and
they
have
to
pay
cash
no
checks
he
does
bank
it
i
proved
that
he
got
it
in
gold
or
diamonds
or
something
being
wise
to
present
conditions
hidden
there
in
the
house
pi
lung
was
after
his
hoard
he
did
get
it
cohen
and
me
was
after
it
where
cohen
i
agreed
that
it
looked
very
suspicious
and
presently
when
i
went
in
with
cohen
continued
poland
i
knew
one
thing
he
did
know
a
short
cut
into
the
warehouse
he
been
playing
with
lala
old
huang
daughter
and
it
my
belief
that
he
knew
where
the
store
was
hidden
but
he
never
told
me
we
knew
there
were
special
men
on
duty
and
we
arranged
that
i
was
to
give
a
signal
when
the
patrol
had
passed
cohen
all
the
time
had
planned
to
double
on
me
while
i
was
watching
down
on
the
causeway
end
he
climbed
up
and
got
in
through
the
skylight
i
shown
him
when
i
got
there
he
was
missing
but
the
skylight
was
open
i
started
off
after
then
poland
clutched
me
and
his
fright
was
very
real
i
heard
a
shriek
like
nothing
i
ever
heard
in
my
life
i
saw
a
light
shine
through
the
trap
and
then
i
heard
a
sort
of
moaning
last
i
heard
a
bang
and
the
light
went
out
i
staggered
down
the
passage
half
silly
started
to
run
and
ran
straight
into
the
arms
of
two
this
evidence
i
thought
was
conclusive
and
in
accordance
with
your
instructions
i
proceeded
to
isaacs
in
dover
street
he
did
seem
too
pleased
at
my
suggestion
but
when
i
pointed
out
to
him
that
one
good
turn
deserved
another
he
agreed
to
give
me
an
introduction
to
huang
chow
i
adopted
a
very
simple
disguise
just
altering
my
complexion
and
sticking
on
a
moustache
with
spirit
gum
hair
by
hair
and
trimming
it
down
military
fashion
everything
ran
smoothly
and
i
seemed
to
make
a
fairly
favourable
impression
upon
lala
huang
the
chinaman
daughter
who
evidently
interviews
prospective
customers
before
they
are
admitted
to
the
warehouse
she
is
a
eurasian
and
extremely
good
looking
but
when
i
found
myself
in
the
room
where
old
huang
keeps
his
treasures
i
really
thought
i
was
dreaming
it
a
collection
that
must
be
worth
thousands
he
showed
me
cut
out
of
gems
and
with
a
little
opening
no
bigger
than
the
hole
in
a
but
with
wonderful
paintings
done
inside
the
bottles
he
got
a
model
of
a
pagoda
made
out
of
human
teeth
and
a
big
golden
rug
woven
from
the
hair
of
circassian
slave
girls
excuse
this
chief
inspector
i
know
it
is
what
you
call
the
romantic
stuff
but
i
think
it
would
have
impressed
you
if
you
had
seen
it
anyway
i
bought
a
little
enamelled
box
in
accordance
with
instructions
although
whether
i
succeeded
in
convincing
huang
chow
that
i
knew
anything
about
the
matter
is
more
than
doubtful
he
got
up
from
a
sort
of
throne
he
sits
on
and
led
the
way
up
a
broad
staircase
to
a
private
room
above
of
course
you
have
brought
the
cash
hampden
he
said
he
speaks
quite
faultless
english
he
walked
up
three
steps
to
a
sort
of
raised
in
this
upstairs
room
and
i
counted
out
the
money
to
him
when
he
sat
at
the
table
he
faced
toward
the
room
and
i
could
help
thinking
that
in
his
spectacles
he
looked
like
some
old
magistrate
he
explained
that
he
would
pack
the
purchase
for
me
but
that
i
must
personally
take
it
away
and
you
understand
said
he
that
you
bought
it
from
a
gentleman
who
had
purchased
it
i
said
i
quite
understood
he
bowed
me
out
very
politely
and
presently
i
found
myself
back
in
the
office
with
lala
huang
she
seemed
quite
disposed
to
talk
and
i
chatted
with
her
while
the
box
was
being
packed
for
me
to
take
away
i
knew
i
must
make
good
use
of
my
time
but
you
have
never
given
me
a
job
i
liked
less
i
mean
there
is
something
very
appealing
about
her
and
i
hated
to
think
that
i
was
playing
a
double
game
however
without
actually
agreeing
to
see
me
again
she
told
me
enough
to
enable
me
to
meet
her
accidentally
if
i
wanted
to
therefore
i
am
going
to
look
out
for
her
this
evening
and
probably
take
her
to
a
picture
palace
or
somewhere
where
we
can
have
a
quiet
talk
she
seems
to
be
fancy
free
and
for
some
reason
i
feel
sorry
for
the
girl
i
do
altogether
like
the
job
but
i
hope
to
justify
your
faith
in
me
chief
i
will
prepare
my
official
report
this
evening
when
i
return
yours
obediently
john
durham
v
lala
huang
no
said
lala
huang
i
do
like
london
not
this
part
of
where
would
you
rather
be
asked
durham
in
china
dusk
had
dropped
its
merciful
curtain
over
limehouse
and
as
the
two
paced
slowly
along
west
india
dock
road
it
seemed
to
the
detective
that
a
sort
of
glamour
had
crept
into
the
scene
he
was
a
clever
man
within
his
limitations
and
cultured
up
to
a
point
but
he
was
not
philosopher
enough
to
know
that
he
viewed
the
purlieus
of
limehouse
through
a
haze
of
oriental
mystery
conjured
up
by
the
conversation
of
his
companion
temple
bells
there
were
in
the
clangour
of
the
road
cars
the
had
a
semblance
of
pagodas
burma
she
had
conjured
up
before
him
and
china
and
the
soft
islands
where
she
had
first
seen
the
light
for
as
well
as
a
streak
of
european
there
was
kanaka
blood
in
lala
which
lent
her
an
appeal
quite
new
to
durham
insidious
and
therefore
dangerous
not
china
she
replied
somehow
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
see
china
again
but
my
father
is
rich
and
it
is
dreadful
to
think
that
we
live
here
when
there
are
so
many
more
beautiful
places
to
live
then
why
does
he
stay
asked
durham
with
curiosity
for
money
always
for
money
answered
lala
shrugging
her
shoulders
yet
if
it
is
not
to
bring
happiness
what
good
is
it
what
good
indeed
murmured
durham
there
is
no
fun
for
me
said
the
girl
pathetically
sometimes
someone
nice
comes
to
do
business
but
mostly
they
are
jews
jews
always
jews
and
again
she
shrugged
eloquently
durham
perceived
the
very
opening
for
which
he
had
been
you
evidently
do
like
jews
he
said
endeavouring
to
speak
lightly
no
murmured
the
girl
i
do
think
i
do
some
are
nice
though
i
think
it
is
the
same
with
every
kind
of
people
there
are
good
and
were
you
ever
in
america
asked
durham
i
was
just
thinking
he
explained
that
i
have
known
several
american
jews
who
were
quite
good
yes
said
lala
looking
up
at
him
naively
i
met
one
not
long
ago
he
was
not
nice
at
oh
exclaimed
durham
startled
by
this
admission
which
he
had
not
anticipated
one
of
your
father
customers
yes
a
man
named
cohen
a
funny
little
chap
continued
the
girl
he
tried
to
make
love
to
she
lowered
her
lashes
roguishly
i
knew
all
along
he
was
pretending
he
was
a
thief
i
think
i
was
afraid
of
durham
did
some
rapid
thinking
then
did
you
say
his
name
was
cohen
he
asked
that
was
the
name
he
a
man
named
cohen
an
american
was
found
dead
in
the
river
quite
lala
stopped
dead
and
clutched
his
arm
how
do
you
know
she
demanded
there
was
a
paragraph
in
this
morning
she
hesitated
then
did
it
describe
him
she
asked
no
replied
durham
i
do
think
it
did
in
detail
at
least
the
only
part
of
the
description
which
i
remember
is
that
he
wore
a
large
and
valuable
diamond
on
his
left
oh
whispered
lala
she
released
her
grip
of
durham
arm
and
went
on
what
he
asked
did
you
think
it
was
someone
you
knew
i
did
know
him
she
replied
simply
the
man
who
was
found
drowned
it
is
the
same
i
am
sure
now
because
of
the
diamond
ring
what
paper
did
you
read
it
in
i
want
to
read
it
i
afraid
i
ca
remember
it
was
probably
the
daily
had
he
been
drowned
i
presume
so
yes
replied
durham
guardedly
lala
huang
was
silent
for
some
time
while
they
paced
on
through
the
dusk
then
how
strange
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
am
sorry
i
mentioned
it
declared
durham
but
how
was
i
to
know
it
was
your
friend
he
was
no
friend
of
mine
returned
the
girl
sharply
i
hated
him
but
it
is
strange
nevertheless
i
am
sure
he
intended
to
rob
my
and
is
that
why
you
think
it
strange
yes
she
said
but
her
voice
was
almost
inaudible
they
were
come
now
to
the
narrow
street
communicating
with
the
courtway
in
which
the
great
of
huang
chow
was
situated
and
lala
stopped
at
the
corner
it
was
nice
of
you
to
walk
along
with
me
she
said
do
you
live
in
limehouse
no
replied
durham
i
do
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
came
down
here
in
the
hope
of
seeing
you
did
you
the
girl
glanced
up
at
him
doubtfully
and
his
distaste
for
the
task
set
him
by
his
superior
increased
with
the
passing
of
every
moment
he
was
a
man
of
some
imagination
a
great
reader
and
ambitious
professionally
he
appreciated
the
fact
that
chief
inspector
kerry
looked
for
great
things
from
him
but
for
this
type
of
work
he
had
little
inclination
there
was
too
much
chivalry
in
his
to
enable
him
to
play
upon
a
woman
sentiments
even
in
the
interests
of
justice
by
whatever
means
the
man
cohen
had
met
his
death
and
whether
or
no
the
chinaman
pi
lung
had
died
by
the
same
hand
lala
huang
was
innocent
of
any
complicity
in
these
matters
he
was
perfectly
well
assured
doubts
were
to
come
later
when
he
was
away
from
her
when
he
had
had
leisure
to
consider
that
she
might
regard
him
in
the
light
of
a
third
potential
rifler
of
her
father
but
at
the
moment
looking
down
into
her
dark
eyes
he
reproached
himself
and
wondered
where
his
true
duty
lay
it
is
so
gray
and
dull
and
sordid
here
said
the
girl
looking
down
the
darkened
street
there
is
no
one
much
to
talk
but
you
have
your
business
interests
to
keep
you
employed
during
the
day
after
i
hate
it
all
i
hate
it
but
you
seem
to
have
perfect
freedom
yes
my
mother
you
see
was
not
but
you
wish
to
leave
limehouse
i
do
i
do
just
now
it
is
not
so
bad
but
in
the
winter
how
i
tire
of
the
gray
skies
the
endless
drizzling
rain
oh
she
shrank
back
into
the
shadow
of
a
doorway
clutching
at
durham
arm
do
let
ah
fu
see
ah
fu
who
is
ah
fu
asked
durham
also
drawing
back
as
a
furtive
figure
went
slinking
down
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
my
father
servant
he
let
you
in
this
and
why
must
he
not
see
you
i
do
trust
him
i
think
he
tells
my
father
what
is
it
that
he
carries
in
his
hand
a
birdcage
i
a
birdcage
yes
he
caught
the
gleam
of
her
eyes
as
she
looked
up
at
him
out
of
the
shadow
is
he
then
a
no
no
i
ca
explain
because
i
do
understand
myself
but
ah
fu
goes
to
a
place
in
shadwell
regularly
and
buys
young
birds
always
very
young
ones
and
very
little
for
what
or
for
whom
i
do
have
you
an
aviary
in
your
house
do
you
mean
that
they
disappear
these
purchases
of
ah
fu
i
often
see
him
carrying
a
cage
of
young
birds
but
we
have
no
birds
in
the
how
perfectly
extraordinary
muttered
durham
i
distrust
ah
fu
whispered
the
girl
i
am
glad
he
did
not
see
me
with
young
birds
murmured
durham
absently
what
kind
of
young
birds
any
particular
breed
no
canaries
linnets
all
sorts
is
it
funny
the
girl
laughed
in
a
childish
way
and
now
i
think
ah
fu
will
have
gone
in
so
i
must
say
good
but
when
presently
detective
durham
found
himself
walking
back
along
west
india
dock
road
his
mind
eye
was
set
upon
the
slinking
figure
of
a
chinaman
carrying
a
birdcage
vi
a
hint
of
incense
one
chinaman
more
or
less
does
not
make
any
very
great
difference
to
the
authorities
responsible
for
maintaining
law
and
order
in
limehouse
asiatic
settlers
are
at
liberty
to
follow
their
national
propensities
and
to
knife
one
another
within
reason
this
is
wisdom
such
recreations
are
allowed
if
not
encouraged
by
all
wise
rulers
of
eastern
peoples
found
drowned
too
is
a
verdict
which
has
covered
many
a
dark
mystery
of
old
thames
but
found
in
the
river
death
having
been
due
to
the
action
of
some
poison
unknown
is
a
finding
which
even
in
the
case
of
a
chinaman
is
calculated
to
stimulate
the
jaded
official
mind
new
scotland
yard
had
given
durham
a
roving
commission
and
had
been
justified
in
the
fact
that
the
second
victim
and
this
time
not
a
chinaman
had
been
found
under
almost
identical
conditions
the
link
with
the
establishment
of
huang
chow
was
incomplete
and
durham
fully
recognized
that
it
was
up
to
him
to
make
it
sound
and
incontestable
jim
poland
was
not
the
only
man
in
the
east
end
who
knew
that
the
dead
chinaman
had
been
in
negotiation
with
huang
chow
kerry
knew
it
and
had
passed
the
information
on
to
durham
some
mystery
surrounded
the
life
of
the
old
dealer
who
was
said
to
be
a
mandarin
of
high
rank
but
his
exact
association
with
the
deaths
first
of
the
chinaman
pi
lung
and
second
of
cohen
remained
to
be
proved
certain
critics
have
declared
the
metropolitan
detective
service
to
be
obsolete
and
inefficient
kerry
as
a
potential
superintendent
resented
these
criticisms
and
in
his
protege
durham
perceived
a
member
of
the
new
generation
who
was
likely
in
time
to
produce
results
calculated
to
remove
this
stigma
durham
recognized
that
a
greater
responsibility
rested
upon
his
shoulders
than
the
actual
importance
of
the
case
might
have
indicated
and
now
proceeding
warily
along
the
deserted
streets
he
found
his
brain
to
be
extraordinarily
active
and
his
imagination
very
much
alive
there
is
a
night
life
in
limehouse
as
he
had
learned
but
it
is
a
mole
life
a
subterranean
life
of
which
no
sign
appears
above
ground
after
a
certain
hour
nevertheless
as
he
entered
the
area
which
harbours
those
strange
hidden
resorts
the
rumour
of
which
has
served
to
create
the
glamour
of
chinatown
he
found
himself
to
be
thinking
of
the
great
influence
said
to
be
wielded
by
huang
chow
and
wondering
if
unseen
spies
watched
his
movements
lala
was
oriental
and
now
alone
in
the
night
distrust
leapt
into
being
within
him
he
had
been
attracted
by
her
and
had
pitied
her
he
told
himself
now
that
this
was
because
of
her
dark
beauty
and
the
essentially
feminine
appeal
which
she
made
she
was
perhaps
a
vampire
of
the
most
dangerous
sort
one
who
lured
men
to
strange
deaths
for
some
sinister
object
beyond
reach
of
a
western
imagination
he
found
himself
doubting
the
success
of
those
tactics
upon
which
earlier
in
the
day
he
had
congratulated
himself
perhaps
beneath
the
guise
of
hampden
who
bought
antique
furniture
on
commission
those
cunning
old
eyes
beneath
the
spectacles
had
perceived
the
detective
hidden
or
at
least
had
marked
subterfuge
while
he
could
not
count
lala
a
conquest
for
he
had
not
even
attempted
to
make
love
to
her
the
ease
with
which
he
had
developed
the
acquaintance
now
afforded
matter
for
suspicion
at
the
entrance
to
the
court
communicating
with
the
establishment
of
huang
chow
he
paused
looking
cautiously
about
him
the
men
on
the
limehouse
beats
had
been
warned
of
the
investigation
afoot
tonight
and
there
was
a
man
on
point
duty
at
no
great
distance
away
although
carefully
hidden
so
that
durham
had
quite
failed
to
detect
his
presence
durham
wore
rough
clothes
and
shoes
and
now
as
he
entered
the
court
he
was
thinking
of
the
official
report
of
the
police
sergeant
who
not
so
many
hours
before
had
paid
a
visit
to
the
house
of
huang
chow
in
order
to
question
him
respecting
his
knowledge
of
the
dead
man
cohen
and
to
learn
when
last
he
had
seen
him
old
huang
who
had
received
his
caller
in
the
large
room
upstairs
the
room
which
boasted
the
presence
of
the
had
exhibited
no
trace
of
confusion
assuring
the
sergeant
that
he
had
not
seen
the
man
cohen
for
several
days
cohen
had
come
to
him
with
an
american
introduction
which
he
huang
believed
to
be
forged
and
had
wanted
him
to
undertake
a
shady
agency
respecting
the
details
of
which
he
remained
peculiarly
reticent
in
short
nothing
had
been
gained
by
this
official
interrogation
and
huang
blandly
denied
any
knowledge
of
an
attempted
burglary
of
his
establishment
what
have
i
to
lose
he
had
asked
the
inquirer
a
lot
of
old
lumber
which
i
have
accumulated
during
many
years
and
a
reputation
for
being
wealthy
due
to
my
lonely
habits
and
to
the
ignorance
of
those
who
live
around
durham
mentally
reviewing
the
words
of
the
report
reconstructed
the
scene
in
his
mind
and
now
having
come
to
the
end
of
the
lane
where
the
iron
post
rested
he
stood
staring
up
at
a
place
in
the
ancient
wall
where
several
bricks
had
decayed
and
where
it
was
possible
according
to
the
statement
of
the
man
poland
to
climb
up
on
to
a
piece
of
sloping
roof
and
thence
gain
the
skylight
through
which
cohen
had
obtained
admittance
on
the
night
of
his
death
he
made
sure
that
his
automatic
pistol
was
in
his
pocket
questioned
the
dull
sounds
of
the
riverside
for
a
moment
looking
about
him
anxiously
and
then
using
the
leaning
post
as
a
he
succeeded
in
wedging
his
foot
into
a
crevice
in
the
wall
by
the
exercise
of
some
agility
he
scrambled
up
to
the
top
and
presently
found
himself
lying
upon
a
sloping
roof
the
skylight
remained
well
out
of
reach
but
his
shoes
enabled
him
to
creep
up
the
slates
until
he
could
grasp
the
framework
with
his
hands
presently
he
found
himself
perched
upon
the
trap
which
if
his
information
could
be
relied
upon
possessed
no
fastener
or
one
so
faulty
that
the
trap
could
be
raised
by
means
of
a
he
carried
one
in
his
pocket
and
screwing
it
into
the
framework
he
lifted
it
cautiously
making
very
little
noise
the
trap
opened
and
up
to
his
nostrils
there
stole
a
queer
indefinable
odour
partly
that
which
belongs
to
old
oriental
furniture
and
stuffs
but
having
mingled
with
it
a
hint
of
incense
and
of
something
else
not
so
easily
named
he
recognized
the
smell
of
that
strange
which
as
hampden
he
had
recently
visited
for
one
moment
he
thought
he
could
detect
the
distant
note
of
a
bell
but
listening
he
heard
nothing
and
was
reassured
he
rested
the
trap
back
against
the
frame
and
shone
the
ray
of
an
electric
torch
down
into
the
darkness
beneath
him
the
light
fell
upon
the
top
of
a
low
carven
table
and
gilded
upon
it
rested
the
model
pagoda
constructed
of
human
teeth
and
there
was
something
in
this
discovery
which
made
durham
feel
inclined
to
shudder
however
the
impulse
was
only
a
passing
one
he
measured
the
distance
with
his
eye
the
little
table
stood
beside
a
deep
divan
and
he
saw
that
with
care
it
would
be
possible
to
drop
upon
this
divan
without
making
much
noise
he
calculated
its
exact
position
before
replacing
the
torch
in
his
pocket
and
then
resting
back
against
one
side
of
the
frame
he
clutched
the
other
with
his
hands
he
wriggled
gradually
down
until
further
purchase
became
impossible
he
then
let
himself
drop
and
swung
for
a
moment
by
his
hands
before
releasing
his
hold
he
fell
as
he
had
calculated
upon
the
divan
it
creaked
ominously
catching
his
foot
in
the
cushions
he
stumbled
and
lay
forward
for
a
moment
upon
his
face
listening
intently
the
room
was
very
hot
but
nothing
stirred
vii
the
scuffling
sound
detective
durham
as
he
lay
there
inhaling
the
peculiar
perfume
of
the
place
recognized
that
he
had
put
himself
outside
the
pale
of
official
protection
and
was
become
technically
a
burglar
he
wondered
if
chief
inspector
kerry
would
have
approved
but
he
had
outlined
this
plan
of
investigation
for
himself
and
knew
well
that
if
it
were
crowned
by
success
the
end
would
be
regarded
as
having
justified
the
means
on
the
other
hand
in
the
event
of
detention
he
must
personally
bear
the
consequences
of
such
irregular
behaviour
he
knew
well
however
that
his
celebrated
superior
had
achieved
promotion
by
methods
at
least
as
irregular
and
he
knew
that
if
he
could
but
obtain
evidence
to
account
for
the
death
of
the
man
cohen
and
of
the
chinaman
pi
lung
who
had
preceded
him
by
the
same
mysterious
path
the
way
of
his
obtaining
it
would
not
be
too
closely
questioned
he
was
an
ambitious
man
and
consequently
one
who
took
big
chances
nothing
disturbed
the
silence
he
sat
upon
the
divan
and
again
pressed
the
button
of
his
torch
shining
it
all
about
the
apartment
and
peering
curiously
into
the
weird
shadows
of
the
place
he
calculated
he
was
now
in
the
position
which
cohen
had
occupied
during
the
last
moments
of
his
life
and
a
sense
of
the
uncanny
touched
him
coldly
as
he
thought
of
the
unnatural
screams
spoken
of
by
poland
some
strange
instinct
prompted
him
to
curl
up
his
feet
upon
the
divan
again
as
though
a
secret
menace
crawled
upon
the
floor
amid
its
many
rugs
and
carpets
he
must
now
endeavour
to
reconstruct
the
plan
upon
which
the
american
cracksman
had
operated
poland
had
a
persistent
belief
that
cohen
had
known
where
the
fabled
hoard
of
huang
chow
was
concealed
durham
began
a
deliberate
inspection
of
the
place
he
thought
it
unlikely
that
a
wily
old
chinaman
assuming
that
he
possessed
hidden
wealth
would
keep
it
in
so
accessible
a
spot
as
this
it
was
far
more
probable
that
he
had
a
fireproof
safe
in
the
room
upstairs
perhaps
built
into
the
wall
yet
according
to
poland
account
it
was
in
this
room
and
not
in
any
other
that
death
came
to
diamond
fred
the
first
engaged
durham
attention
he
moved
them
aside
systematically
one
after
another
seeking
for
any
but
failing
to
find
one
the
door
communicating
with
the
outer
office
he
found
to
be
locked
but
he
did
not
believe
for
a
moment
that
the
office
would
be
worthy
of
inspection
there
were
cases
containing
jewelled
weapons
and
cups
and
goblets
inlaid
with
precious
stones
but
none
of
these
seemed
to
have
been
tampered
with
and
all
were
locked
as
was
the
big
cabinet
filled
with
snuff
bottles
many
of
the
larger
pieces
about
the
place
contained
drawers
and
cupboards
and
these
he
systematically
opened
one
after
another
without
making
any
discovery
of
note
some
of
the
cupboards
contained
broken
pieces
of
crockery
and
more
or
less
damaged
curios
of
one
kind
and
another
but
none
of
them
gave
him
the
clue
for
which
he
was
seeking
he
examined
the
couch
upon
which
huang
chow
had
been
seated
when
first
he
had
met
him
but
although
he
searched
it
scientifically
he
was
rewarded
by
no
discovery
a
very
fusty
and
unpleasant
smell
was
more
noticeable
at
this
point
than
elsewhere
in
the
room
and
he
found
himself
staring
speculatively
up
the
wide
carpeted
stairs
next
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
lacquered
coffin
which
occupied
the
corresponding
recess
to
that
filled
by
the
couch
it
was
an
extraordinarily
ornate
piece
of
lacquer
work
and
probably
of
great
value
the
lid
appeared
to
be
screwed
on
and
durham
stood
staring
at
the
thing
half
revolted
and
half
fascinated
he
failed
to
discover
any
means
of
opening
it
however
and
when
he
tried
to
move
it
bodily
found
it
very
heavy
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
all
the
portable
valuables
were
contained
in
locked
cases
or
cabinets
and
out
of
this
discovery
grew
an
idea
the
case
containing
the
snuff
bottles
stood
too
close
to
the
wall
to
enable
him
to
test
his
new
theory
but
a
square
case
near
the
office
door
in
which
were
five
of
six
small
but
almost
priceless
pieces
of
porcelain
afforded
the
very
evidence
for
which
he
was
looking
thin
electric
flex
descended
from
somewhere
inside
the
case
down
one
of
the
legs
of
the
pedestal
and
through
a
neatly
drilled
hole
in
the
floor
evidently
placed
there
to
accommodate
it
burglar
alarm
he
muttered
the
opening
of
this
case
and
doubtless
of
any
of
the
others
would
set
alarm
bells
ringing
this
was
not
an
unimportant
discovery
but
it
brought
him
very
little
nearer
to
a
solution
of
the
chief
problem
which
engaged
his
mind
assuming
that
cohen
had
opened
one
of
the
cases
and
had
alarmed
old
huang
chow
what
steps
had
the
latter
taken
to
deal
with
the
intruder
which
had
resulted
in
so
ghastly
a
death
and
how
had
he
disposed
of
the
body
as
durham
stood
there
musing
and
looking
down
through
the
at
the
delicate
porcelain
beneath
a
faint
sound
intruded
itself
upon
the
stillness
it
gave
him
another
idea
part
of
the
floor
was
but
part
was
wood
upon
a
portion
of
the
latter
where
no
carpet
rested
durham
dropped
flat
pressing
his
ear
to
the
floor
a
faint
swishing
and
trickling
sound
was
perceptible
from
some
place
beneath
ah
he
murmured
remembering
that
the
premises
almost
overhung
the
thames
he
divined
that
the
cellars
were
flooded
at
high
tide
or
that
there
was
some
kind
of
drain
or
cutting
running
underneath
the
house
he
stood
up
again
listening
intently
for
any
sound
within
the
building
he
thought
he
had
detected
something
and
now
as
he
stood
there
alert
he
heard
it
again
a
faint
scuffling
which
might
have
been
occasioned
by
rats
or
even
mice
but
which
in
some
subtle
and
very
unpleasant
way
did
not
suggest
the
movements
of
these
familiar
rodents
even
as
he
perceived
it
it
ceased
leaving
him
wondering
and
uncomfortably
conscious
of
a
sudden
dread
of
his
surroundings
he
wondered
in
what
part
of
this
mysterious
house
lala
resided
and
recognizing
that
his
departure
must
leave
traces
he
determined
to
prosecute
his
inquiries
as
far
as
possible
since
another
opportunity
might
not
arise
he
was
baffled
but
still
hopeful
something
there
was
in
the
smell
of
the
place
which
threatened
to
unnerve
him
or
perhaps
in
its
silence
which
remained
quite
unbroken
save
when
by
acute
listening
one
detected
the
dripping
of
water
that
unexplained
scuffling
sound
too
which
he
had
failed
to
trace
or
identify
lingered
in
his
memory
insistently
and
for
some
reason
contained
the
elements
of
fear
he
crossed
the
room
and
began
softly
to
mount
the
stair
it
creaked
only
slightly
and
the
door
at
the
top
proved
to
be
ajar
he
peeped
in
to
find
the
place
empty
it
was
a
typical
chinese
apartment
containing
very
little
furniture
the
raised
desk
being
the
most
noticeable
item
except
for
a
small
shrine
which
faced
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
he
mounted
the
steps
to
the
desk
and
inspected
a
number
of
loose
papers
which
lay
upon
it
without
exception
they
were
written
in
chinese
a
sort
of
large
dull
white
lay
upon
the
table
but
its
surface
was
smooth
and
glossy
over
it
was
suspended
what
looked
like
a
lampshade
but
on
inspection
it
proved
to
contain
no
lamp
but
to
communicate
by
a
sort
of
funnel
with
the
ceiling
above
at
this
contrivance
durham
stared
long
and
curiously
but
without
coming
to
any
conclusion
respecting
its
purpose
he
might
have
investigated
further
but
he
became
aware
of
a
dull
and
regular
sound
in
the
room
behind
him
he
turned
in
a
flash
staring
in
the
direction
of
two
curtains
draped
before
what
he
supposed
to
be
a
door
on
tiptoe
he
crossed
and
gently
drew
the
curtains
aside
he
looked
into
a
small
room
lighted
by
one
window
where
upon
a
low
bed
huang
chow
lay
sleeping
peacefully
durham
almost
held
his
breath
then
withdrawing
as
quietly
as
he
had
approached
he
descended
the
stair
at
the
foot
his
attention
was
again
arrested
by
the
faint
scuffling
sound
it
ceased
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
leaving
him
wondering
and
conscious
anew
of
a
chill
of
apprehension
he
had
already
made
his
plans
for
departure
but
knew
that
they
must
leave
evidence
when
discovered
of
his
visit
a
large
and
solid
table
stood
near
the
divan
and
he
moved
this
immediately
under
the
trap
upon
it
he
laid
a
to
deaden
any
noise
he
might
make
and
then
upon
the
he
set
a
massive
chair
he
replaced
his
torch
in
his
pocket
and
drew
himself
up
on
to
the
roof
again
reclosing
the
trap
by
means
of
the
awl
which
he
had
screwed
into
it
he
removed
the
awl
and
placed
it
in
his
pocket
then
sliding
gently
down
the
sloping
roof
he
dropped
back
into
the
deserted
court
viii
a
cage
of
birds
no
said
lala
we
have
never
had
robbers
in
the
she
looked
up
at
durham
naively
you
are
not
a
thief
are
you
she
asked
no
i
assure
you
i
am
not
he
answered
and
felt
himself
flushing
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
they
were
seated
in
a
teashop
patronized
by
the
workers
of
the
district
and
as
durham
his
elbows
resting
on
the
table
looked
into
the
dark
eyes
of
his
companion
he
told
himself
again
that
whatever
might
be
the
secrets
of
old
huang
chow
his
daughter
did
not
share
them
the
chinaman
had
made
no
report
to
the
authorities
although
the
piled
up
furniture
beneath
the
skylight
must
have
afforded
conclusive
evidence
that
a
burglarious
entry
had
been
made
into
the
premises
i
should
feel
very
nervous
durham
declared
with
all
those
valuables
in
the
i
feel
nervous
about
my
father
the
girl
answered
in
a
low
voice
his
room
opens
out
of
the
warehouse
but
mine
is
shut
away
in
another
part
of
the
building
and
ah
fu
sleeps
behind
the
were
you
not
afraid
when
you
suspected
that
cohen
was
a
burglar
you
told
me
yourself
that
you
did
suspect
yes
i
spoke
to
my
father
about
and
what
did
he
say
oh
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
he
just
smiled
and
told
me
not
to
and
that
was
the
last
you
heard
about
the
matter
yes
until
you
told
me
he
was
again
he
questioned
the
dark
eyes
and
again
was
baffled
he
felt
tempted
and
not
for
the
first
time
to
throw
up
the
case
after
all
it
rested
upon
very
slender
data
the
mysterious
death
of
a
chinaman
whose
history
was
unknown
and
the
story
of
a
crook
whose
word
was
worth
nothing
finally
he
asked
himself
as
he
had
asked
himself
before
what
did
it
matter
if
old
huang
chow
had
disposed
of
these
people
in
some
strange
manner
they
had
sought
to
rob
him
the
morality
of
the
case
was
complicated
and
obscure
and
more
and
more
he
was
falling
under
the
spell
of
lala
dark
eyes
but
always
it
was
his
professional
pride
which
came
to
the
rescue
murder
had
been
done
whether
justifiably
or
otherwise
and
to
him
had
been
entrusted
the
discovery
of
the
murderer
it
seemed
that
failure
was
to
be
his
lot
for
if
lala
knew
anything
she
was
a
most
consummate
actress
and
if
she
did
not
his
last
hope
of
information
was
gone
he
would
have
liked
nothing
better
than
to
be
rid
of
the
affair
provided
he
could
throw
up
the
case
with
a
clear
conscience
but
when
presently
he
parted
from
the
attractive
eurasian
and
watched
her
slim
figure
as
turning
she
waved
her
hand
and
disappeared
round
a
corner
he
knew
that
rest
was
not
for
him
he
had
discovered
the
emporium
of
a
shadwell
dealer
with
whom
ah
fu
had
a
standing
order
for
newly
fledged
birds
of
all
descriptions
purchases
apparently
were
always
made
after
dusk
and
ah
fu
with
his
birdcage
was
due
that
evening
a
scheme
having
suggested
itself
to
durham
he
now
proceeded
to
put
it
into
execution
so
that
when
dusk
came
and
ah
fu
carrying
an
empty
birdcage
set
out
from
the
house
of
huang
chow
a
very
loafer
passed
the
corner
of
the
street
at
about
the
time
that
the
chinaman
came
slinking
out
durham
had
mentally
calculated
that
ah
fu
would
be
gone
about
half
an
hour
upon
his
mysterious
errand
but
the
chinaman
travelled
faster
than
he
had
calculated
just
as
he
was
about
to
climb
up
once
more
on
to
the
sloping
roof
he
heard
the
pattering
footsteps
returning
to
the
courtyard
although
rather
less
than
twenty
minutes
had
elapsed
since
the
man
had
set
out
durham
darted
round
the
corner
and
waited
until
he
heard
the
door
closed
then
returning
he
scrambled
up
on
to
the
roof
creeping
forward
until
he
was
lying
looking
down
through
the
skylight
into
the
darkened
room
below
for
ten
minutes
or
more
he
waited
until
he
began
to
feel
cramped
and
uncomfortable
then
that
happened
which
he
had
hoped
and
anticipated
would
happen
the
place
beneath
became
illuminated
not
fully
by
means
of
the
hanging
lamps
but
dimly
so
that
distorted
shadows
were
cast
about
the
floor
someone
had
entered
carrying
a
lantern
durham
limited
his
area
of
vision
but
presently
as
the
light
came
nearer
and
nearer
he
discerned
ah
fu
carrying
a
lantern
in
one
hand
and
a
birdcage
in
the
other
he
could
hear
nothing
for
the
trap
fitted
well
and
the
glass
was
thick
moreover
it
was
very
dirty
he
was
afraid
however
to
attempt
to
clean
a
space
ah
fu
apparently
had
set
the
lantern
upon
a
table
and
into
the
radius
of
its
light
there
presently
moved
a
stooping
figure
durham
recognized
huang
chow
and
felt
his
heart
beats
increasing
in
rapidity
clutching
the
framework
of
the
trap
with
his
hands
he
moved
his
head
cautiously
so
that
presently
he
was
enabled
to
see
the
two
chinamen
they
were
standing
beside
the
lacquered
coffin
upon
its
pedestal
durham
stifled
an
exclamation
one
end
of
the
ornate
sarcophagus
had
been
opened
in
some
way
now
to
the
watcher
unbounded
astonishment
ah
fu
placed
the
birdcage
in
the
opening
and
apparently
reclosed
the
trap
in
the
end
of
the
coffin
he
made
other
manipulations
with
his
bony
yellow
fingers
which
durham
failed
to
comprehend
finally
the
birdcage
was
withdrawn
again
and
as
it
was
passed
before
the
light
of
the
lantern
he
saw
that
it
was
empty
whereas
previously
it
had
contained
a
number
of
tiny
birds
all
huddled
up
together
the
light
gleamed
upon
the
spectacles
of
huang
chow
watching
him
durham
saw
him
take
out
from
a
hidden
drawer
in
the
pedestal
a
long
slender
key
insert
it
in
a
lock
concealed
by
the
ornate
carving
and
then
slightly
raise
the
lid
which
had
so
recently
defied
his
own
efforts
he
raised
it
only
a
few
inches
and
then
taking
up
the
lantern
peered
into
the
interior
of
the
coffin
at
the
same
time
waving
his
hand
in
dismissal
to
ah
fu
for
a
while
he
stood
there
peering
into
the
interior
and
then
lowering
the
lid
again
he
relocked
this
gruesome
receptacle
and
lantern
in
hand
began
to
mount
the
stair
durham
inhaled
deeply
he
realized
that
during
the
last
few
seconds
he
had
been
holding
his
breath
now
as
he
began
to
creep
back
down
the
slope
he
discovered
that
his
hands
were
shaking
he
dropped
down
into
the
court
again
and
for
several
minutes
leaned
against
the
wall
endeavouring
to
reason
out
an
explanation
of
what
he
had
seen
and
in
a
measure
to
regain
his
composure
there
was
a
horror
underlying
it
all
which
he
was
half
afraid
to
face
but
the
real
clue
to
the
mystery
still
eluded
him
whether
what
he
had
witnessed
were
some
kind
of
obscene
ceremony
or
whether
an
explanation
more
vile
must
be
sought
he
remained
undetermined
he
must
repeat
his
exploit
if
possible
and
once
more
gain
access
to
the
room
which
contained
the
lacquer
coffin
but
the
adventure
was
very
distasteful
he
recollected
the
smell
of
the
place
and
the
memory
brought
with
it
a
sense
of
nausea
he
thought
of
lala
huang
and
his
ideas
became
grotesque
and
chaotic
yet
the
solution
of
the
mystery
lay
at
last
within
his
grasp
and
to
the
zest
of
the
investigator
everything
else
became
subjugated
he
walked
slowly
away
silent
in
his
shoes
ix
the
picture
on
the
pad
lala
huang
lay
listening
to
the
vague
sounds
which
disturbed
the
silence
of
the
night
presently
her
thoughts
made
her
sigh
wearily
during
the
lifetime
of
her
mother
who
had
died
while
lala
was
yet
a
little
girl
life
had
been
different
and
so
much
brighter
she
imagined
that
in
the
mingled
sounds
of
dock
and
river
which
came
to
her
she
could
hear
the
roar
of
surf
upon
a
golden
beach
the
stuffy
air
of
limehouse
took
on
the
hot
fragrance
of
a
tropic
island
and
she
sighed
again
but
this
time
rapturously
for
in
spirit
she
was
a
child
once
more
lulled
by
the
voice
of
the
great
pacific
young
as
she
was
the
death
of
her
mother
had
been
a
blow
from
which
it
had
taken
her
several
years
to
recover
then
had
commenced
those
long
travels
with
her
father
from
port
to
port
from
ocean
to
ocean
sometimes
settling
awhile
but
ever
moving
onward
onward
he
had
had
her
educated
after
a
fashion
and
his
love
for
her
she
did
not
doubt
but
her
mother
blood
spoke
more
strongly
than
that
part
of
her
which
was
chinese
and
there
was
softness
and
a
delicious
languor
in
her
nature
which
her
father
did
not
seem
to
understand
and
of
which
he
did
not
appear
to
approve
she
knew
that
he
was
wealthy
she
knew
that
his
ways
were
not
straight
ways
although
that
part
of
his
business
to
which
he
had
admitted
her
as
an
assistant
and
an
able
one
was
legitimate
enough
or
so
it
seemed
consignments
of
goods
arrived
at
strange
hours
of
the
night
at
the
establishment
in
limehouse
and
from
this
side
of
her
transactions
she
was
barred
the
big
double
doors
opening
on
the
little
courtyard
would
be
opened
by
ah
fu
and
packing
cases
of
varying
sizes
be
taken
in
sometimes
the
sounds
of
these
activities
would
reach
her
in
her
room
in
a
distant
part
of
the
house
but
only
in
the
morning
would
she
recognize
their
significance
when
in
the
warehouse
she
would
discover
that
some
new
and
choice
pieces
had
arrived
she
wondered
with
what
object
her
father
accumulated
wealth
and
hoped
against
the
promptings
of
her
common
sense
that
he
designed
to
return
east
there
to
seek
a
retirement
amidst
the
familiar
and
the
beautiful
things
of
the
orient
which
belonged
to
lala
dream
of
heaven
stories
about
her
father
often
reached
her
ears
she
knew
that
he
had
held
high
rank
in
china
before
she
had
been
born
but
that
he
had
sacrificed
his
rights
in
some
way
had
always
been
her
theory
she
had
been
too
young
to
understand
the
stories
which
her
mother
had
told
her
sometimes
but
that
there
were
traits
in
the
character
of
huang
chow
which
it
was
not
good
for
his
daughter
to
know
she
appreciated
and
accepted
as
a
secret
sorrow
he
allowed
her
all
the
freedom
to
which
her
education
entitled
her
her
life
was
that
of
a
european
and
not
of
an
oriental
woman
she
loved
him
in
a
way
but
also
feared
him
she
feared
the
dark
and
cruel
side
of
his
character
of
which
at
various
periods
during
their
life
together
she
had
had
terrifying
glimpses
she
had
decided
that
cruelty
was
his
vice
in
what
way
he
gratified
it
she
had
never
learned
nor
did
she
desire
to
do
so
there
were
periodical
visits
from
the
police
but
she
had
learned
long
ago
that
her
father
was
too
clever
to
place
himself
within
reach
of
the
law
however
crooked
one
part
of
his
business
methods
might
be
his
dealings
with
his
clients
were
straight
enough
so
that
no
one
had
any
object
in
betraying
him
and
the
legality
or
otherwise
of
his
foreign
relations
evidently
afforded
no
case
against
him
upon
which
the
authorities
could
act
or
upon
which
they
cared
to
act
in
america
it
had
been
graft
which
had
protected
him
she
had
learned
this
accidentally
but
never
knew
whether
he
bought
his
immunity
in
the
same
way
in
london
some
of
the
rumours
which
reached
her
were
terrifying
latterly
she
had
met
many
strange
glances
in
her
comings
and
goings
about
limehouse
this
peculiar
atmosphere
had
always
preceded
the
of
every
home
which
they
had
shared
she
divined
the
fact
that
in
some
way
huang
chow
had
outstayed
his
welcome
in
chinatown
london
where
their
next
would
be
she
could
not
imagine
but
she
prayed
that
it
might
be
in
some
more
sunny
clime
she
found
herself
to
be
thinking
over
much
of
john
hampden
his
bona
fides
were
not
above
suspicion
but
she
could
scarcely
expect
to
meet
a
really
white
man
in
such
an
environment
lala
would
have
liked
to
think
that
he
was
white
but
could
not
force
herself
to
do
so
she
would
have
liked
to
think
that
he
sought
her
company
because
she
appealed
to
him
personally
but
she
had
detected
the
fact
that
another
motive
underlay
his
attentions
she
wondered
if
he
could
be
another
of
those
moths
drawn
by
the
light
of
that
fabled
wealth
of
her
father
it
was
curious
she
reflected
that
huang
chow
never
checked
indeed
openly
countenanced
her
friendship
with
the
many
chance
acquaintances
she
had
made
even
when
her
own
instincts
told
her
that
the
men
were
crooked
so
that
knowing
the
acumen
of
her
father
she
was
well
aware
that
he
must
know
it
too
several
of
these
pseudo
lovers
of
hers
had
died
it
was
a
point
which
often
occurred
to
her
mind
but
upon
which
she
did
not
care
to
dwell
even
now
but
john
hampden
john
hampden
was
different
he
was
not
wholly
sincere
she
sighed
wearily
but
nevertheless
he
was
not
like
some
of
the
others
she
started
up
in
bed
seized
with
a
sudden
dreadful
idea
he
was
a
detective
she
understood
now
why
she
had
found
so
much
that
was
white
in
him
but
so
much
that
was
false
his
presence
seemed
to
be
very
near
her
something
caressing
in
his
voice
echoed
in
her
mind
she
found
herself
to
be
listening
to
the
muted
sounds
of
limehouse
and
of
the
waterway
which
flowed
so
close
beside
her
that
old
longing
for
the
home
of
her
childhood
returned
tenfold
and
tears
began
to
trickle
down
her
cheeks
she
was
falling
in
love
with
this
man
whose
object
was
her
father
ruin
a
cold
terror
clutched
at
her
heart
even
now
while
their
friendship
was
so
new
so
strange
there
was
a
query
a
stark
terrifying
query
to
stand
up
before
her
if
put
to
the
test
which
would
she
choose
she
was
unable
to
face
that
issue
and
dropped
back
upon
her
pillow
stifling
a
sob
yes
he
was
a
detective
in
some
way
her
father
had
at
last
attracted
the
serious
attention
of
the
law
rumours
of
this
were
flying
round
chinatown
to
which
she
had
not
been
entirely
deaf
she
thought
of
a
hundred
questions
a
hundred
silences
and
grew
more
and
more
convinced
of
the
truth
what
did
he
mean
to
do
before
her
a
ghostly
company
uprose
the
shadows
of
some
she
had
known
with
designs
upon
her
father
john
design
was
different
but
might
he
not
join
that
mysterious
company
now
again
she
suddenly
sprang
upright
this
time
because
of
a
definite
sound
which
had
reached
her
ears
from
within
the
house
a
very
faint
tinkling
which
ceased
almost
immediately
she
had
heard
it
one
night
before
and
quite
recently
indeed
on
the
night
before
she
had
met
john
hampden
cohen
cohen
the
jew
had
died
that
night
she
sprang
lightly
on
to
the
floor
found
her
slippers
and
threw
a
silk
kimono
over
her
nightrobe
she
tiptoed
cautiously
to
the
door
and
opened
it
it
was
at
this
very
moment
that
old
huang
chow
asleep
in
his
apartment
was
aroused
by
the
tinkling
of
a
bell
set
immediately
above
his
head
he
awoke
instantly
raised
his
hand
and
stopped
the
bell
his
expression
could
anyone
have
been
present
to
see
it
was
a
thing
unpleasant
to
behold
triumph
was
in
it
and
cunning
cruelty
his
long
yellow
fingers
reached
out
for
his
hornrimmed
spectacles
which
lay
upon
a
little
table
beside
him
adjusting
them
he
pulled
the
curtains
aside
and
shuffled
silently
across
the
large
room
mounting
the
steps
to
the
raised
he
rested
his
elbows
upon
it
and
peered
down
at
that
curious
which
had
so
provoked
the
curiosity
of
durham
could
durham
have
seen
it
now
the
mystery
must
have
been
solved
it
was
an
ingenious
camera
obscura
apparatus
and
dimly
depicted
upon
its
surface
appeared
a
reproduction
of
part
of
the
storehouse
beneath
the
part
of
it
which
was
visible
was
that
touched
by
the
light
of
an
electric
torch
carried
by
a
man
crossing
the
floor
in
the
direction
of
the
lacquered
coffin
upon
the
gilded
pedestal
old
huang
chow
chuckled
silently
and
his
yellow
fingers
clutched
the
table
edge
as
he
moved
to
peer
more
closely
into
the
picture
poor
fool
he
whispered
in
chinese
poor
fool
it
was
the
man
who
had
come
with
the
introduction
from
isaacs
a
new
impostor
who
sought
to
rob
him
who
sought
to
obtain
information
from
his
daughter
who
had
examined
his
premises
last
night
and
had
even
penetrated
upstairs
so
that
he
old
huang
chow
had
been
compelled
to
disconnect
the
apparatus
and
to
feign
sleep
under
the
scrutiny
of
the
intruder
it
would
be
otherwise
it
would
be
otherwise
x
the
lacquered
coffin
durham
gently
raised
the
trap
in
the
roof
of
huang
he
was
prepared
for
snares
and
pitfalls
no
sane
man
on
the
evidence
which
he
durham
had
been
compelled
to
leave
behind
would
have
neglected
to
fasten
the
skylight
which
so
obviously
afforded
a
means
of
entrance
into
his
premises
therefore
he
was
expected
to
return
the
devilish
mechanism
was
set
ready
to
receive
him
but
the
artist
within
him
demanded
that
he
should
unmask
the
mystery
with
his
own
hands
moreover
he
doubted
that
an
official
visit
even
now
would
yield
any
results
old
huang
chow
was
too
cunning
for
that
if
he
was
to
learn
how
the
man
cohen
had
died
he
must
follow
the
same
path
to
the
bitter
end
but
there
were
men
on
duty
round
the
house
and
he
believed
that
he
had
placed
them
so
secretly
as
to
deceive
even
this
master
of
cunning
with
whom
he
was
dealing
he
repeated
his
exploit
dropping
with
a
dull
thud
upon
the
cushioned
divan
then
having
lain
there
listening
awhile
he
pressed
the
button
of
his
torch
and
standing
up
crept
across
the
room
in
the
direction
of
the
stairway
here
he
paused
awhile
listening
intently
the
image
of
lala
huang
arose
before
his
mind
eye
reproachfully
but
he
crushed
the
reproach
and
advanced
until
he
stood
beside
the
lacquered
coffin
he
remembered
where
the
key
was
hidden
and
stooping
he
fumbled
for
a
while
and
then
found
it
he
was
acutely
conscious
of
an
unnameable
fear
he
felt
that
he
was
watched
and
yet
was
unwilling
to
believe
it
the
musty
and
unpleasant
smell
which
he
had
noticed
before
became
extremely
perceptible
he
quietly
sought
for
the
hidden
lock
and
presently
finding
it
inserted
the
key
then
paused
awhile
he
rested
his
torch
upon
the
cushions
of
the
divan
where
the
light
shone
directly
upon
the
coffin
then
having
his
automatic
in
his
left
hand
he
turned
the
key
he
had
expected
now
to
be
able
to
raise
the
lid
as
he
had
seen
huang
chow
do
but
the
result
was
far
more
surprising
the
lid
together
with
a
second
framework
of
fine
netting
flew
open
with
a
resounding
bang
and
from
the
interior
of
the
coffin
uprose
a
most
abominable
stench
durham
started
back
a
step
and
as
he
did
so
witnessed
a
sight
which
turned
him
sick
with
horror
out
on
to
the
edge
of
the
coffin
leapt
the
most
gigantic
spider
which
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
it
had
a
body
as
big
as
a
man
fist
jet
black
with
hairy
legs
like
the
legs
of
a
crab
and
a
span
of
a
foot
or
more
a
moment
it
poised
there
while
he
swayed
sick
with
horror
then
unhesitatingly
it
leapt
for
his
face
he
groaned
and
fired
missed
the
horror
but
diverted
its
leap
so
that
it
fell
with
a
sickening
thud
a
yard
behind
him
he
turned
staggering
back
towards
the
stair
and
aware
that
a
light
had
shone
out
from
somewhere
a
door
had
been
opened
only
a
few
yards
from
where
he
stood
and
there
framed
in
the
opening
was
lala
huang
her
eyes
wide
with
terror
and
her
gaze
set
upon
him
across
the
room
you
she
whispered
you
go
back
he
cried
hoarsely
go
back
close
the
door
you
understand
close
the
door
her
gaze
set
wildly
upon
him
lala
staggered
forward
stopped
dead
looked
down
at
her
bare
ankle
and
then
seeing
the
thing
which
had
fastened
upon
her
uttered
a
piercing
shriek
which
rang
throughout
the
place
at
which
moment
the
floor
slid
away
beneath
durham
and
he
found
himself
falling
falling
and
then
battling
for
life
in
water
amidst
absolute
darkness
police
whistles
were
skirling
around
the
house
of
huang
chow
as
the
hidden
men
came
running
into
the
court
you
heard
the
shot
cried
the
sergeant
in
charge
i
warned
him
not
to
go
alone
do
waste
time
on
the
door
one
man
stay
on
duty
there
the
rest
of
you
follow
in
a
few
moments
led
by
the
sergeant
the
party
came
dropping
heavily
through
the
skylight
into
the
of
huang
chow
in
which
every
lamp
was
now
alight
a
trap
was
open
near
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
from
beneath
it
muffled
cries
proceeded
in
this
direction
the
sergeant
headed
craning
over
the
trap
hallo
durham
he
called
mr
durham
get
a
rope
and
a
ladder
came
a
faint
cry
from
below
i
can
just
touch
bottom
with
my
feet
and
keep
my
head
above
water
but
the
coming
in
look
to
the
girl
though
first
look
to
the
girl
the
sergeant
turned
to
where
stretched
upon
a
tiger
skin
before
a
door
lala
huang
lay
scantily
clothed
and
white
as
death
upon
one
of
her
bare
ankles
was
a
discoloured
mark
as
the
sergeant
and
another
of
the
men
stooped
over
her
a
moaning
sound
drew
their
attention
to
the
stair
and
there
bent
and
tottering
slowly
down
was
old
huang
chow
his
eyes
peering
through
the
glasses
vacantly
across
the
room
to
where
his
daughter
lay
my
god
whispered
the
sergeant
upon
one
knee
beside
her
he
looked
blankly
into
the
face
of
the
other
man
she
dead
two
men
were
busy
knotting
together
tapestries
and
pieces
of
rare
stuff
with
which
to
draw
durham
out
of
the
pit
but
at
these
old
huang
chow
looked
not
at
all
but
gropingly
crossed
the
room
as
if
he
saw
imperfectly
or
could
not
believe
what
he
saw
at
last
he
reached
the
side
of
the
dead
girl
stooped
touched
her
laid
a
trembling
yellow
hand
over
her
heart
and
then
stood
up
again
looking
from
face
to
face
ignoring
the
mingled
activities
about
him
he
crossed
to
the
open
coffin
and
began
to
fumble
amongst
the
putrefying
mass
of
bones
and
webbing
which
lay
therein
out
from
this
he
presently
drew
an
iron
coffer
carrying
it
across
the
room
he
opened
the
lid
it
was
full
almost
to
the
top
with
uncut
gems
of
every
variety
diamonds
rubies
sapphires
emeralds
topaz
amethysts
flashing
greenly
redly
whitely
in
handfuls
he
grasped
them
and
sprinkled
them
upon
the
body
of
the
dead
girl
for
you
he
crooned
brokenly
in
chinese
they
were
all
for
you
the
extemporized
rope
had
just
been
lowered
to
durham
when
my
god
cried
the
sergeant
looking
over
huang
chow
shoulder
what
that
he
had
seen
the
giant
spider
the
horror
from
surinam
which
the
chinaman
had
reared
and
fed
to
guard
his
treasure
and
to
gratify
his
lust
for
the
strange
and
cruel
the
insect
like
everything
else
in
that
house
was
unusual
almost
unique
it
was
one
of
the
black
soldier
spiders
by
some
regarded
as
a
native
myth
but
actually
existing
in
surinam
and
parts
of
brazil
a
member
of
the
family
mygale
its
sting
was
more
quickly
and
certainly
fatal
than
that
of
a
its
instinct
was
fearlessly
to
attack
any
creature
great
or
small
which
disturbed
it
in
its
dark
now
with
feverish
horrible
rapidity
it
was
racing
up
the
tapestries
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
merciful
god
groaned
the
sergeant
snatching
a
revolver
from
his
pocket
he
fired
shot
after
shot
the
third
hit
the
thing
but
did
not
kill
it
it
dropped
back
upon
the
floor
and
began
to
crawl
toward
the
coffin
the
sergeant
ran
across
and
at
close
quarters
shot
it
again
red
blood
oozed
out
from
the
hideous
black
body
and
began
to
form
a
deep
stain
upon
the
carpet
when
durham
drenched
but
unhurt
was
hauled
back
into
the
he
did
not
speak
but
scrambling
into
the
room
stood
pallid
staring
dully
at
old
huang
chow
huang
chow
upon
his
knees
beside
his
daughter
was
engaged
in
sprinkling
priceless
jewels
over
her
still
body
and
murmuring
in
chinese
for
you
for
you
lala
they
were
all
for
kerry
kid
i
red
kerry
on
duty
chief
inspector
kerry
came
down
from
the
top
of
a
and
stood
on
the
sidewalk
for
a
while
gazing
to
right
and
left
along
piccadilly
the
night
was
humid
and
misty
now
threatening
fog
and
now
rain
many
travellers
were
abroad
at
this
christmas
season
the
pleasure
seekers
easily
to
be
distinguished
from
those
whom
business
had
detained
in
town
and
who
hurried
toward
their
various
firesides
the
theatres
were
disgorging
their
audiences
streams
of
lighted
cars
bore
parties
supperward
less
pretentious
taxicabs
formed
links
in
the
chain
from
the
little
huddled
crowd
of
more
economical
who
waited
at
the
stopping
place
of
the
kerry
detached
himself
walking
slowly
along
westward
and
staring
reflectively
about
him
opposite
the
corner
of
bond
street
he
stood
still
swinging
his
malacca
cane
and
gazing
fixedly
along
this
narrow
bazaar
street
of
the
baghdad
of
the
west
his
trim
athletic
figure
was
muffled
in
a
big
woolly
overcoat
the
collar
turned
up
about
his
ears
his
neat
bowler
hat
was
tilted
forward
so
as
to
shade
the
fierce
blue
eyes
indeed
in
that
imperfect
light
little
of
the
chief
countenance
was
visible
except
his
large
gleaming
white
teeth
which
he
constantly
revealed
in
the
act
of
industriously
chewing
mint
gum
he
smiled
as
he
chewed
duty
had
called
him
out
into
the
mist
and
for
once
he
had
obeyed
reluctantly
that
very
afternoon
had
seen
the
return
of
dan
kerry
junior
home
from
school
for
the
christmas
vacation
and
dan
was
the
apple
of
his
father
eye
kerry
had
reserved
her
dour
scottish
comments
upon
the
boy
school
report
for
a
more
seemly
occasion
than
the
first
day
of
his
holidays
but
kerry
had
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
his
jubilation
almost
immoral
his
wife
had
declared
it
to
be
respecting
the
lad
athletic
record
his
work
on
the
junior
left
wing
had
gained
the
commendation
of
a
celebrated
international
and
kerry
who
had
interviewed
the
gymnasium
instructor
had
learned
that
dan
junior
bade
fair
to
become
an
amateur
boxer
of
distinction
he
is
faster
on
his
feet
than
any
boy
i
ever
handled
the
expert
had
declared
he
has
got
the
weight
behind
it
yet
of
course
but
developing
a
left
that
going
to
make
history
i
of
opinion
that
there
is
a
boy
in
the
seniors
can
take
him
on
and
i
say
that
a
credit
to
those
words
had
fallen
more
sweetly
upon
the
ears
of
chief
inspector
kerry
than
any
encomium
of
the
boy
learning
could
have
done
on
the
purely
scholastic
side
his
report
was
not
a
good
one
admittedly
but
murmured
kerry
aloud
he
going
to
be
a
he
remembered
that
he
had
promised
despite
the
lateness
of
the
hour
to
telephone
the
lad
directly
he
had
received
a
certain
report
and
to
tell
him
whether
he
might
wait
up
for
his
return
or
whether
he
must
turn
in
kerry
stamping
his
small
neatly
shod
feet
upon
the
pavement
smiled
agreeably
he
was
thinking
of
the
telephone
which
recently
he
had
had
installed
in
his
house
in
brixton
his
wife
had
demanded
this
as
a
christmas
box
pointing
out
how
many
uneasy
hours
she
would
be
spared
by
the
installation
kerry
had
consented
cheerfully
enough
for
was
he
not
shortly
to
be
promoted
to
the
exalted
post
of
a
superintendent
of
the
criminal
investigation
department
these
reflections
were
cheering
and
warming
and
waiting
until
a
gap
occurred
in
the
stream
of
cabs
and
cars
he
crossed
piccadilly
and
proceeded
along
bond
street
swinging
his
shoulders
in
a
manner
which
would
have
enabled
any
constable
in
the
force
to
recognize
red
kerry
at
a
hundred
yards
the
fierce
eyes
scrutinized
the
occupants
of
all
the
lighted
cars
at
pedestrians
also
he
stared
curiously
and
at
another
smaller
group
of
travellers
waiting
for
the
buses
on
the
side
of
the
street
he
looked
hard
and
long
he
pursued
his
way
acknowledged
the
salutation
of
a
porter
who
stood
outside
the
entrance
to
the
embassy
club
and
proceeded
glancing
about
him
right
and
left
and
with
some
evident
and
definite
purpose
a
constable
standing
at
the
corner
of
conduit
street
touched
his
helmet
as
kerry
passed
and
the
light
of
an
revealed
the
fierce
red
face
the
chief
inspector
stopped
turned
and
what
the
devil
the
idea
he
demanded
he
snapped
out
the
words
in
such
fashion
that
the
unfortunate
constable
almost
believed
he
could
see
sparks
in
the
misty
air
i
sorry
sir
but
recognizing
you
suddenly
like
i
you
did
the
fierce
voice
interrupted
how
long
in
the
force
six
months
never
salute
an
officer
in
plain
i
know
then
why
did
you
do
it
i
told
you
then
tell
me
i
you
paid
to
remember
bear
it
in
kerry
tucked
his
malacca
under
his
arm
and
walked
on
leaving
the
unfortunate
policeman
literally
stupefied
by
his
first
encounter
with
the
celebrated
chief
inspector
presently
another
line
of
cars
proclaimed
the
entrance
to
a
club
and
just
before
reaching
the
first
of
these
kerry
paused
a
man
stood
in
a
shadowy
doorway
and
good
evening
chief
inspector
he
said
quietly
good
evening
durham
anything
to
report
yes
lou
chada
is
here
with
whom
lady
kerry
stepped
to
the
edge
of
the
pavement
and
spat
out
a
piece
of
from
his
overcoat
pocket
he
drew
a
fresh
piece
tore
off
the
pink
wrapping
and
placed
the
gum
between
his
teeth
then
how
long
he
demanded
came
to
dinner
they
are
h
the
chief
inspector
ranged
himself
beside
the
other
detective
in
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
something
brewing
durham
he
said
i
think
i
shall
his
subordinate
stared
curiously
but
made
no
reply
he
was
not
wholly
in
his
chief
confidence
he
merely
knew
that
the
name
of
lou
chada
to
kerry
was
like
a
red
rag
to
a
bull
the
handsome
cultured
young
eurasian
fresh
from
a
distinguished
university
career
and
pampered
by
a
certain
section
of
smart
society
did
not
conform
to
detective
sergeant
durham
idea
of
a
suspect
he
knew
that
lou
was
the
son
of
zani
chada
and
he
knew
that
zani
chada
was
one
of
the
wealthiest
men
in
limehouse
but
lou
had
an
expensive
flat
in
george
street
lou
was
courted
by
society
butterflies
and
in
what
way
he
could
be
connected
with
the
case
known
as
the
limehouse
inquiry
durham
could
not
imagine
that
the
open
indiscretion
of
lady
pat
rourke
might
lead
to
trouble
with
her
husband
was
conceivable
enough
but
this
was
rather
a
matter
for
underhand
private
inquiry
than
for
the
attention
of
the
criminal
investigation
department
of
new
scotland
yard
so
mused
durham
standing
cold
and
uncomfortable
in
the
shadowy
doorway
and
dreaming
of
a
certain
cosy
fireside
a
pair
of
carpet
slippers
and
a
glass
of
hot
toddy
which
awaited
him
suddenly
great
flames
look
he
cried
kerry
fingers
closed
steely
upon
durham
wrist
a
porter
was
urgently
moving
the
parked
cars
farther
along
the
street
to
enable
one
a
french
coupe
to
draw
up
before
the
club
entrance
two
men
came
out
supporting
between
them
a
woman
who
seemed
to
be
ill
a
slender
blonde
woman
whose
pretty
face
was
pale
and
whose
blue
eyes
stared
strangely
straight
before
her
the
taller
of
her
escorts
while
continuing
to
support
her
solicitously
wrapped
her
fur
cloak
about
her
bare
shoulders
the
other
the
manager
of
the
club
stepped
forward
and
opened
the
door
of
the
car
lady
rourke
whispered
durham
with
lou
chada
rapped
kerry
run
for
a
cab
brisk
do
waste
a
some
little
conversation
ensued
between
manager
and
patron
then
the
tall
handsome
eurasian
waving
his
hand
protestingly
removed
his
hat
and
stepped
into
the
coupe
beside
lady
rourke
it
immediately
moved
away
in
the
direction
of
piccadilly
one
glimpse
kerry
had
of
the
pretty
fair
head
lying
limply
back
against
the
cushions
the
manager
of
the
club
was
staring
after
the
car
kerry
stepped
out
from
his
hiding
place
durham
had
disappeared
and
there
was
no
cab
in
sight
but
immediately
beyond
the
illuminated
entrance
stood
a
which
had
been
fifth
in
the
rank
of
parked
cars
before
the
adjustment
had
been
made
to
enable
the
coupe
to
reach
the
door
kerry
ran
across
and
whose
car
my
lad
he
demanded
of
the
chauffeur
the
latter
resenting
the
curt
tone
of
the
inquiry
looked
the
speaker
up
and
down
and
captain
egerton
he
replied
slowly
but
what
business
may
it
be
of
yours
i
chief
inspector
kerry
of
new
scotland
yard
came
the
rapid
reply
i
want
to
follow
the
car
that
has
just
what
about
running
demanded
the
man
insolently
kerry
shot
out
a
small
muscular
hand
and
grasped
the
speaker
wrist
i
say
one
thing
to
you
he
rapped
i
a
police
officer
and
i
demand
your
help
refuse
it
and
you
wake
up
in
vine
the
chief
inspector
was
on
the
step
now
bending
forward
so
that
his
fierce
red
face
was
but
an
inch
removed
from
that
of
the
startled
chauffeur
the
quelling
force
of
his
ferocious
personality
achieved
its
purpose
as
it
rarely
failed
to
do
i
getting
in
added
the
chief
inspector
jumping
back
on
to
the
pavement
lose
that
french
bus
and
i
charge
you
with
resisting
and
obstructing
an
officer
of
the
law
in
the
execution
of
his
duty
kerry
leaped
in
and
banged
the
door
and
the
started
ii
at
malay
when
kerry
left
bond
street
the
mistiness
of
the
night
was
developing
into
definite
fog
it
varied
in
different
districts
thus
churchyard
had
been
clear
of
it
at
a
time
when
it
had
lain
impenetrably
in
trafalgar
square
when
an
hour
and
a
half
after
setting
out
in
the
commandeered
kerry
groped
blindly
along
limehouse
causeway
it
was
through
a
yellow
murk
that
he
made
his
way
a
vapour
which
could
not
only
be
seen
smelled
and
felt
but
tasted
he
was
in
one
of
his
most
violent
humours
he
found
some
slight
solace
in
the
reflection
that
the
impudent
chauffeur
from
whom
he
had
parted
in
west
india
dock
road
must
experience
great
difficulty
in
finding
his
way
back
to
the
west
end
damn
the
fog
he
muttered
coughing
irritably
it
had
tricked
him
this
floating
murk
of
london
for
while
he
had
been
enabled
to
keep
the
coupe
in
view
right
to
the
fringe
of
dockland
here
as
if
bred
by
old
london
river
the
fog
had
lain
impenetrably
chief
inspector
kerry
was
a
man
who
took
many
risks
but
because
of
this
cursed
fog
he
had
no
definite
evidence
that
chada
car
had
gone
to
a
certain
house
right
of
search
he
had
not
and
so
temporarily
he
was
baffled
now
the
nearest
telephone
was
his
objective
and
presently
where
a
blue
light
dimly
pierced
the
mist
he
paused
pushed
open
a
swing
door
and
stepped
into
a
long
narrow
passage
he
descended
three
stairs
and
entered
a
room
laden
with
a
sickly
perfume
compounded
of
stale
beer
and
spirits
of
greasy
humanity
european
asiastic
and
african
of
cheap
tobacco
and
cheaper
scents
and
vaguely
of
opium
it
was
fairly
well
lighted
but
the
fog
had
penetrated
here
veiling
some
of
the
harshness
of
its
rough
appointments
an
unsavoury
den
was
malay
jack
where
flotsam
of
the
river
might
be
found
yellow
men
there
were
and
black
men
and
brown
men
but
all
the
women
present
were
white
was
in
progress
at
one
of
the
tables
the
four
players
being
apparently
the
only
strictly
sober
people
in
the
room
a
woman
was
laughing
raucously
as
kerry
entered
and
many
conversations
were
in
progress
but
as
he
pulled
the
rough
curtain
walls
aside
and
walked
into
the
room
a
hush
highly
complimentary
to
the
chief
inspector
reputation
fell
upon
the
assembly
only
the
raucous
laughter
continued
rising
a
hideous
solo
above
a
sort
of
murmur
composed
of
the
words
red
kerry
spoken
in
many
tones
kerry
ignored
the
sensation
which
his
entrance
had
created
and
crossed
the
room
to
a
small
counter
behind
which
a
dusky
man
was
standing
coatless
and
shirt
sleeves
rolled
up
he
had
the
skin
of
a
malay
but
the
features
of
a
stage
irishman
of
the
old
school
and
indeed
had
he
known
his
own
pedigree
which
is
a
knowledge
beyond
the
ken
of
any
man
partly
irish
he
might
have
found
himself
indeed
to
be
this
was
malay
jack
the
proprietor
of
one
of
the
roughest
houses
in
limehouse
his
expression
while
propitiatory
was
not
friendly
but
do
get
hot
and
bothered
snapped
kerry
viciously
i
want
to
use
your
telephone
that
oh
said
the
other
unable
to
conceal
his
relief
that
easy
come
he
raised
a
flap
in
the
counter
and
kerry
passing
through
entered
a
little
room
behind
the
bar
here
a
telephone
stood
upon
a
dirty
littered
table
and
taking
it
up
city
four
hundred
called
the
chief
inspector
curtly
a
moment
later
hallo
yes
he
said
chief
inspector
kerry
speaking
put
me
through
to
my
department
he
stood
for
a
while
waiting
receiver
in
hand
and
smiled
grimly
to
note
that
the
uproar
in
the
room
beyond
had
been
resumed
evidently
malay
jack
had
given
the
all
clear
signal
then
chief
inspector
kerry
speaking
he
said
again
has
detective
sergeant
durham
reported
yes
was
the
reply
half
an
hour
ago
he
at
limehouse
station
he
followed
you
in
a
taxi
but
lost
you
on
the
way
owing
to
the
i
do
wonder
said
kerry
his
loss
is
not
so
great
as
mine
anything
else
nothing
good
i
speak
to
limehouse
he
replaced
the
receiver
and
paused
for
a
moment
reflecting
extracting
a
piece
of
tasteless
gum
from
between
his
teeth
he
deposited
it
in
the
grate
where
a
sickly
fire
burned
then
tearing
the
wrapper
from
a
fresh
slip
he
resumed
his
chewing
and
stood
looking
about
him
with
unseeing
eyes
fierce
they
were
as
ever
but
introspective
in
expression
famous
for
his
swift
decisions
for
once
in
a
way
he
found
himself
in
doubt
malay
jack
had
keen
ears
and
there
were
those
in
the
place
who
had
every
reason
to
be
interested
in
the
movements
of
a
member
of
the
criminal
investigation
department
especially
of
one
who
had
earned
the
right
to
be
dreaded
by
the
rats
of
limehouse
london
peculiar
climate
fought
against
him
but
he
determined
to
make
no
more
telephone
calls
but
to
proceed
to
limehouse
police
station
he
stepped
swiftly
into
the
bar
and
as
he
had
anticipated
nearly
upset
the
proprietor
who
was
standing
listening
by
the
door
kerry
smiled
fiercely
into
the
ugly
face
lifted
the
flap
and
walked
down
the
room
through
the
aisle
between
the
scattered
tables
where
the
air
was
heavy
with
strange
perfumes
touched
now
with
the
bite
of
london
fog
and
where
slanting
eyes
and
straight
eyes
sober
eyes
and
drunken
eyes
regarded
him
furtively
something
of
a
second
hush
there
was
but
one
not
so
complete
as
the
first
kerry
pulled
the
curtain
aside
mounted
the
stair
walked
along
the
passage
and
out
through
the
swing
door
into
the
yellow
gloom
of
the
causeway
ten
slow
steps
he
had
taken
when
he
detected
a
sound
of
pursuit
like
a
flash
he
turned
clenching
his
fists
then
inspector
whispered
a
husky
voice
yes
who
are
you
what
do
you
want
a
dim
form
loomed
up
through
the
fog
my
name
is
peters
sir
inspector
preston
knows
kerry
had
paused
immediately
under
a
street
lamp
and
now
he
looked
into
the
pinched
lean
face
of
the
speaker
and
i
heard
of
you
he
snapped
got
some
information
for
me
i
think
so
but
walk
chief
inspector
kerry
hesitated
peters
belonged
to
a
class
which
kerry
despised
with
all
the
force
of
his
straightforward
character
a
professional
informer
has
his
uses
from
the
police
point
of
view
and
while
evidence
of
this
kind
often
figured
in
reports
made
to
the
chief
inspector
he
personally
avoided
contact
with
such
persons
as
he
instinctively
and
daintily
avoided
contact
with
personal
dirt
but
now
something
so
big
was
at
stake
that
his
hesitation
was
only
momentary
a
vision
of
the
pale
face
of
lady
rourke
of
the
golden
head
leaning
weakly
back
upon
the
cushions
of
the
coupe
as
he
had
glimpsed
it
in
bond
street
rose
before
his
mind
eye
as
if
conjured
up
out
of
the
fog
peters
shuffled
along
beside
him
and
young
chada
done
himself
in
continued
the
husky
voice
he
brought
a
swell
girl
to
the
old
man
house
an
hour
ago
i
was
hanging
about
there
thinking
i
might
get
some
information
i
think
she
was
why
snapped
kerry
well
i
was
standing
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
lou
chada
opened
the
door
with
a
key
and
when
the
light
shone
out
i
saw
him
carry
her
carry
her
in
yes
she
was
in
evening
dress
with
a
swell
the
car
he
came
out
again
and
drove
it
around
to
the
garage
at
the
why
did
you
report
this
at
once
i
was
on
my
way
to
do
it
when
i
saw
you
coming
out
of
malay
the
man
voice
shook
nervously
and
what
are
you
scared
about
asked
kerry
savagely
got
anything
else
to
tell
me
no
no
muttered
peters
only
i
got
an
idea
he
saw
who
saw
you
lou
what
then
well
only
do
leave
me
till
we
get
to
the
kerry
blew
down
his
nose
contemptuously
then
stopped
suddenly
stand
still
he
ordered
i
want
to
silent
they
stood
in
a
place
of
darkness
untouched
by
any
lamplight
not
a
sound
reached
them
through
the
curtain
of
fog
asiatic
mystery
wrapped
them
about
but
kerry
experienced
only
contempt
for
the
cowardice
of
his
companion
and
you
need
come
no
farther
he
said
coldly
good
but
began
the
man
good
night
repeated
kerry
he
walked
on
briskly
tapping
the
pavement
with
his
malacca
the
sneaking
figure
of
the
informer
was
swallowed
up
in
the
fog
but
not
a
dozen
paces
had
the
chief
inspector
gone
when
he
was
arrested
by
a
frenzied
scream
rising
hollowly
in
a
dreadful
muffled
crescendo
words
reached
him
my
god
he
stabbed
me
then
came
a
sort
of
babbling
which
died
into
a
moan
hell
muttered
kerry
the
poor
devil
was
right
he
turned
and
began
to
run
back
fumbling
in
his
pocket
for
his
electric
torch
almost
in
the
same
moment
that
he
found
it
he
stumbled
upon
peters
who
lay
half
in
the
road
and
half
upon
the
sidewalk
kerry
pressed
the
button
and
met
the
glance
of
upturned
glazing
eyes
even
as
he
dropped
upon
his
knee
beside
the
dying
man
peters
swept
his
arm
around
in
a
convulsive
movement
having
the
fingers
crooked
coughed
horribly
and
rolled
upon
his
face
switching
off
the
light
of
the
torch
kerry
clenched
his
jaws
in
a
tense
effort
of
listening
literally
holding
his
breath
but
no
sound
reached
him
through
the
muffling
fog
a
moment
he
hesitated
well
knowing
his
danger
then
viciously
snapping
on
the
light
again
he
quested
in
the
mud
all
about
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
ah
it
was
an
exclamation
of
triumph
one
corner
hideously
stained
for
it
had
lain
half
under
shoulder
kerry
gingerly
lifted
between
finger
and
thumb
a
handkerchief
of
fine
white
silk
such
as
is
carried
in
the
breast
pocket
of
an
evening
coat
it
bore
an
ornate
monogram
worked
in
gold
and
representing
the
letters
l
oddly
enough
it
was
the
corner
that
bore
the
monogram
which
was
also
bloodstained
iii
the
room
of
the
golden
buddha
it
was
a
moot
point
whether
lady
pat
rourke
merited
condemnation
or
pity
she
possessed
that
type
of
blonde
beauty
which
seems
to
be
a
lodestone
for
mankind
in
general
her
husband
was
wealthy
twelve
years
her
senior
and
far
from
watching
over
her
with
jealous
care
an
attitude
which
often
characterizes
such
unions
he
on
the
contrary
permitted
her
a
dangerous
freedom
believing
that
she
would
appreciate
without
abusing
it
her
friendship
with
lou
chada
had
first
opened
his
eyes
to
the
perils
which
beset
the
road
of
least
resistance
sir
noel
rourke
was
an
and
his
prejudice
against
the
eurasian
was
one
not
lightly
to
be
surmounted
not
all
the
polish
which
english
culture
had
given
to
this
child
of
a
mixed
union
could
blind
sir
noel
to
the
yellow
streak
courted
though
chada
was
by
some
of
the
best
people
sir
noel
remained
cold
the
long
magnetic
eyes
the
handsome
features
above
all
that
slow
and
alluring
smile
appealed
to
the
husband
of
the
wilful
pat
rather
as
evidences
of
oriental
devilry
than
as
passports
to
decent
society
oxford
had
veneered
him
but
scratch
the
veneer
and
one
found
the
of
the
east
perfumed
seductive
appealing
but
something
to
be
shunned
as
brittle
and
untrustworthy
yet
he
hesitated
seeking
to
be
true
to
his
convictions
knowing
what
he
knew
already
and
what
he
suspected
it
is
certain
that
could
he
have
viewed
lou
chada
through
the
eyes
of
chief
inspector
kerry
the
affair
must
have
terminated
otherwise
but
sir
noel
did
not
know
what
kerry
knew
and
the
lady
rourke
with
her
hair
of
spun
gold
and
her
provoking
smile
found
lou
chada
dangerously
fascinating
almost
she
was
infatuated
she
who
had
known
so
much
admiration
of
those
joys
for
which
thousands
of
her
plainer
sisters
yearn
and
starve
to
the
end
of
their
days
she
had
experienced
a
surfeit
always
she
sought
for
novelty
for
new
adventures
she
was
confident
of
herself
but
yet
and
here
lay
the
delicious
thrill
not
wholly
confident
many
times
she
had
promised
to
visit
the
house
of
lou
father
a
mystery
palace
cunningly
painted
a
perfumed
page
from
the
arabian
poets
dropped
amid
the
interesting
squalor
of
limehouse
perhaps
she
had
never
intended
to
go
who
knows
but
on
the
night
when
she
came
within
the
ken
of
chief
inspector
kerry
lou
chada
had
urged
her
to
do
so
in
his
poetically
passionate
fashion
and
wanting
to
go
she
had
asked
herself
am
i
strong
enough
dare
i
they
had
dined
danced
and
she
had
smoked
one
of
the
scented
cigarettes
which
he
alone
seemed
to
be
able
to
procure
and
which
on
their
arrival
from
the
east
were
contained
in
queer
little
polished
wooden
boxes
then
had
come
an
unfamiliar
nausea
and
dizziness
an
uncomfortable
recognition
of
the
fact
that
she
was
making
a
fool
of
herself
and
finally
a
through
which
familiar
faces
loomed
up
and
were
quickly
lost
again
there
was
the
soft
musical
voice
of
lou
chada
reassuring
her
a
sense
of
chill
of
helplessness
and
then
for
a
while
an
interval
which
afterward
she
found
herself
unable
to
bridge
knowledge
of
verity
came
at
last
and
lady
pat
raised
herself
from
the
divan
upon
which
she
had
been
lying
and
her
slender
hands
clutching
the
cushions
stared
about
her
with
eyes
which
ever
grew
wider
she
was
in
a
long
rather
lofty
room
which
was
lighted
by
three
silver
lanterns
swung
from
the
ceiling
the
place
without
containing
much
furniture
was
a
riot
of
garish
barbaric
colour
there
were
deep
divans
cushioned
in
amber
and
upon
the
floor
lay
persian
carpets
and
skins
of
beasts
cunning
niches
there
were
half
concealing
and
half
revealing
chinese
jars
and
odd
little
carven
tables
bore
strangely
fashioned
vessels
of
silver
there
was
a
cabinet
of
ebony
inlaid
with
jade
there
were
black
tapestries
figured
with
dragons
of
green
and
gold
curtains
she
saw
of
and
in
a
tall
narrow
recess
dominating
the
room
squatted
a
great
golden
buddha
the
atmosphere
was
laden
with
a
strange
perfume
but
above
all
this
room
was
silent
most
oppressively
silent
lady
pat
started
to
her
feet
the
whole
perfumed
place
seemed
to
be
swimming
around
her
reclosing
her
eyes
she
fought
down
her
weakness
the
truth
the
truth
respecting
lou
chada
and
herself
had
uprisen
starkly
before
her
by
her
own
folly
and
she
could
find
no
tiny
excuse
she
had
placed
herself
in
the
power
of
a
man
whom
instinctively
deep
within
her
soul
she
had
always
known
to
be
utterly
unscrupulous
how
cleverly
he
had
concealed
the
wild
animal
which
dwelt
beneath
that
suave
polished
exterior
yet
how
ill
he
had
concealed
it
for
intuitively
she
had
always
recognized
its
presence
but
had
deliberately
closed
her
eyes
finding
a
joy
in
the
secret
knowledge
of
danger
now
at
last
he
had
discarded
pretense
the
cigarette
which
he
had
offered
her
at
the
club
had
been
drugged
she
was
in
limehouse
at
the
mercy
of
a
man
in
whose
veins
ran
the
blood
of
ancestors
to
whom
women
had
been
chattels
too
well
she
recognized
that
his
passion
must
have
driven
him
insane
as
he
must
know
at
what
cost
he
took
such
liberties
with
one
who
could
not
lightly
be
so
treated
but
these
reflections
afforded
poor
consolation
it
was
not
of
the
penalties
that
lou
chada
must
suffer
for
this
infringement
of
western
codes
but
of
the
price
that
she
must
pay
for
her
folly
of
which
pat
was
thinking
there
was
a
nauseating
taste
upon
her
palate
she
remembered
having
noticed
it
faintly
while
she
was
smoking
the
cigarette
indeed
she
had
commented
upon
it
at
the
time
the
dirty
yellow
blackguard
she
said
aloud
and
clenched
her
hands
she
merely
echoed
what
many
a
man
had
said
before
her
she
wondered
at
herself
and
in
doing
so
but
wondered
at
the
mystery
of
womanhood
clarity
was
returning
the
room
no
longer
swam
around
her
she
crossed
in
the
direction
of
a
garish
curtain
which
instinctively
she
divined
to
mask
a
door
dragging
it
aside
she
tried
the
handle
but
the
door
was
locked
a
second
door
she
found
and
this
also
proved
to
be
locked
there
was
one
tall
window
also
covered
by
ornate
draperies
but
it
was
shuttered
and
the
shutters
had
locks
another
small
window
she
discovered
glazed
with
amber
glass
but
set
so
high
in
the
wall
as
to
be
inaccessible
dread
assailed
her
and
dropping
on
to
one
of
the
divans
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
my
god
she
whispered
my
god
give
me
strength
give
me
for
a
long
time
she
remained
there
listening
for
any
sound
which
should
disperse
the
silence
she
thought
of
her
husband
of
the
sweet
security
of
her
home
of
the
things
which
she
had
forfeited
because
of
this
mad
quest
of
adventure
and
presently
a
key
grated
in
a
lock
lady
pat
started
to
her
feet
with
a
wild
swift
action
which
must
have
reminded
a
beholder
of
a
startled
gazelle
the
drapery
masking
the
door
which
she
had
first
investigated
was
drawn
aside
a
man
entered
and
dropped
the
curtain
behind
him
exactly
what
she
had
expected
she
could
not
have
defined
but
the
presence
of
this
perfect
stranger
was
a
complete
surprise
the
man
who
wore
embroidered
slippers
and
a
sort
of
long
blue
robe
stood
there
regarding
her
with
an
expression
which
even
in
her
frantic
condition
she
found
to
be
puzzling
he
had
long
untidy
gray
hair
brushed
back
from
his
low
brow
eyes
strangely
like
the
eyes
of
lou
chada
except
that
they
were
more
but
his
skin
was
as
yellow
as
a
guinea
and
his
gaunt
cleanshaven
face
was
the
face
of
an
oriental
the
slender
hands
too
which
he
held
clasped
before
him
were
yellow
and
possessed
a
curiously
arresting
quality
pat
imagined
them
clasped
about
her
white
throat
and
her
very
soul
seemed
to
shrink
from
the
man
who
stood
there
looking
at
her
with
those
long
magnetic
inscrutable
eyes
she
wondered
why
she
was
surprised
and
suddenly
realized
that
it
was
because
of
the
expression
in
his
eyes
for
it
was
an
expression
of
cold
anger
then
the
intruder
spoke
who
are
you
he
demanded
speaking
with
an
accent
which
was
unfamiliar
to
her
but
in
a
voice
which
was
not
unlike
the
voice
of
lou
chada
who
brought
you
here
this
was
so
wholly
unexpected
that
for
a
moment
she
found
herself
unable
to
reply
but
finally
how
dare
you
she
cried
her
native
courage
reasserting
itself
i
have
been
drugged
and
brought
to
this
place
you
shall
pay
for
it
how
dare
you
ah
the
long
dark
eyes
regarded
her
unmovingly
but
who
are
you
i
am
lady
rourke
open
the
door
you
shall
bitterly
regret
this
you
are
lady
rourke
the
man
repeated
before
you
speak
of
regrets
answer
the
question
which
i
have
asked
who
brought
you
here
lou
ah
there
was
no
alteration
of
pose
no
change
of
expression
but
slightly
the
intonation
had
varied
i
do
know
who
you
are
but
i
demand
to
be
released
from
this
place
the
man
standing
before
the
curtained
door
slightly
inclined
his
head
you
shall
be
released
he
replied
but
not
instantly
i
will
see
the
one
who
brought
you
here
he
may
not
be
entirely
to
blame
before
you
leave
we
shall
understand
one
tone
and
glance
were
coldly
angry
then
before
the
frightened
woman
could
say
another
word
the
man
in
the
blue
robe
robe
withdrew
the
curtain
was
dropped
again
and
she
heard
the
grating
of
a
key
in
the
lock
she
ran
to
the
door
beating
upon
it
with
her
clenched
hands
let
me
go
she
cried
half
hysterically
let
me
go
you
shall
pay
for
this
oh
you
shall
pay
for
this
no
one
answered
and
turning
she
leaned
back
against
the
curtain
breathing
heavily
and
fighting
for
composure
for
strength
iv
zani
chada
the
eurasian
i
ca
help
thinking
chief
inspector
said
the
officer
in
charge
at
limehouse
station
that
you
take
unnecessary
ca
you
said
kerry
tilting
his
bowler
farther
forward
and
staring
truculently
at
the
speaker
no
i
ca
since
you
cleaned
up
the
dope
gang
down
here
you
been
a
marked
man
these
murders
in
the
chinatown
area
of
which
this
one
makes
the
third
have
got
some
kind
of
big
influence
behind
them
yet
you
wander
about
in
the
fog
without
even
a
gun
in
your
i
do
believe
in
guns
rapped
kerry
my
bare
hands
are
good
enough
for
any
yellow
smart
in
this
area
and
if
they
give
out
i
can
kick
like
a
the
other
laughed
shaking
his
head
it
silly
all
the
same
he
persisted
the
man
who
did
the
job
out
there
in
the
fog
might
have
knifed
you
or
shot
you
long
before
you
could
have
got
he
might
snapped
kerry
but
he
yet
remembering
his
wife
who
would
be
waiting
for
him
in
the
cosy
he
knew
a
sudden
pang
perhaps
he
did
take
unnecessary
chances
others
had
said
so
hard
upon
the
thought
came
the
memory
of
his
boy
and
of
the
telephone
message
which
the
episodes
of
the
night
had
prevented
him
from
sending
he
remembered
too
something
which
his
fearless
nature
had
prompted
him
to
forget
he
remembered
how
just
as
he
had
arisen
from
beside
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
oblique
eyes
had
regarded
him
swiftly
out
of
the
fog
he
had
lashed
out
with
a
boxer
instinct
but
his
knuckles
had
encountered
nothing
but
empty
air
no
sound
had
come
to
tell
him
that
the
thing
had
not
been
an
illusion
only
once
again
as
he
groped
his
way
through
the
shuttered
streets
of
chinatown
and
the
silence
of
the
yellow
mist
something
had
prompted
him
to
turn
and
again
he
had
detected
the
glint
of
oblique
eyes
and
faintly
had
discerned
the
form
of
one
who
followed
him
kerry
chewed
viciously
then
i
think
i
the
wife
he
said
abruptly
she
be
expecting
almost
before
he
had
finished
speaking
the
bell
rang
and
a
few
moments
later
someone
to
speak
to
you
chief
inspector
cried
the
officer
in
charge
ah
exclaimed
kerry
his
fierce
eyes
lighting
up
that
will
be
from
i
do
think
so
was
the
reply
but
see
who
it
hello
he
called
he
was
answered
by
an
unfamiliar
voice
a
voice
which
had
a
queer
guttural
intonation
it
was
the
sort
of
voice
he
had
learned
to
loathe
is
that
chief
inspector
kerry
yes
he
snapped
may
i
take
it
that
what
i
have
to
say
will
be
treated
in
confidence
certainly
think
again
chief
inspector
the
voice
continued
you
are
a
man
within
sight
of
the
ambition
of
years
and
although
you
may
be
unaware
of
the
fact
you
stand
upon
the
edge
of
a
disaster
i
appreciate
your
sense
of
duty
and
respect
it
but
there
are
times
when
diplomacy
is
a
more
potent
weapon
than
kerry
listening
became
aware
that
the
speaker
was
a
man
of
cultured
intellect
he
wondered
greatly
but
my
time
is
valuable
he
said
rapidly
come
to
the
point
what
do
you
want
and
who
are
you
one
moment
chief
inspector
an
opportunity
to
make
your
fortune
without
interfering
with
your
career
has
come
in
your
way
you
have
obtained
possession
of
what
you
believe
to
be
a
clue
to
a
the
voice
ceased
and
kerry
remaining
silent
immediately
continued
knowing
your
personal
character
i
doubt
if
you
have
communicated
the
fact
of
your
possessing
this
evidence
to
anyone
else
i
suggest
in
your
own
interests
that
before
doing
so
you
interview
kerry
thought
rapidly
and
then
i
do
say
you
right
he
rapped
back
but
if
i
come
to
see
you
i
shall
leave
a
sealed
statement
in
possession
of
the
officer
in
charge
to
this
i
have
no
objection
the
guttural
voice
replied
but
i
beg
of
you
to
bring
the
evidence
with
i
not
to
be
bought
warned
kerry
do
think
it
and
do
suggest
it
or
when
i
get
to
you
i
break
you
in
his
red
moustache
positively
bristled
and
he
clutched
the
receiver
so
tightly
that
it
quivered
against
his
ear
you
mistake
me
replied
the
speaker
my
name
is
zani
chada
you
know
where
i
live
i
shall
not
detain
you
more
than
five
minutes
if
you
will
do
me
the
honour
of
calling
upon
kerry
chewed
furiously
for
ten
momentous
seconds
then
i
come
he
said
he
replaced
the
receiver
on
the
hook
and
walking
across
to
the
charge
desk
took
an
official
form
and
a
pen
on
the
back
of
the
form
he
scribbled
rapidly
watched
with
curiosity
by
the
officer
in
charge
give
me
an
envelope
he
directed
an
envelope
was
found
and
handed
to
him
he
placed
the
paper
in
the
envelope
gummed
down
the
lapel
and
addressed
it
in
large
bold
writing
to
the
assistant
commissioner
of
the
criminal
investigation
department
who
was
his
chief
finally
i
going
out
he
explained
after
what
i
said
after
what
you
said
i
going
out
if
i
do
come
back
or
telephone
within
the
next
hour
you
will
know
what
to
do
with
the
limehouse
official
stared
perplexedly
but
meanwhile
he
protested
what
steps
am
i
to
take
about
the
murder
durham
will
be
back
with
the
body
at
any
moment
now
and
you
say
you
got
a
clue
to
the
i
have
said
kerry
but
i
going
to
get
definite
evidence
do
nothing
until
you
hear
from
very
good
answered
the
other
and
kerry
tucking
his
malacca
cane
under
his
arm
strode
out
into
the
fog
his
knowledge
of
the
limehouse
area
was
extensive
and
peculiar
so
that
twenty
minutes
later
having
made
only
one
mistake
in
the
darkness
he
was
pressing
an
electric
bell
set
beside
a
door
which
alone
broke
the
expanse
of
a
long
and
dreary
brick
wall
lining
a
street
which
neither
by
day
nor
night
would
have
seemed
inviting
to
the
casual
visitor
the
door
was
opened
by
a
chinaman
wearing
national
dress
revealing
a
small
square
lobby
warmly
lighted
and
furnished
orientally
kerry
stepped
in
briskly
i
want
to
see
zani
chada
tell
him
i
am
here
chief
inspector
kerry
is
my
the
chinaman
bowed
crossed
the
lobby
and
drawing
some
curtains
aside
walked
up
four
carpeted
stairs
and
disappeared
into
a
short
passage
revealed
by
the
raising
of
the
tapestry
as
he
did
so
kerry
stared
about
him
curiously
he
had
never
before
entered
the
mystery
house
of
zani
chada
nor
had
he
personally
encountered
the
eurasian
reputed
to
be
a
millionaire
but
who
chose
for
some
obscure
reason
to
make
his
abode
in
this
old
rambling
building
once
a
country
mansion
which
was
closely
invested
by
dockland
and
the
narrow
alleys
of
chinatown
it
was
curiously
still
in
the
lobby
and
as
he
determined
curiously
eastern
he
was
conscious
of
a
sense
of
exhilaration
that
zani
chada
controlled
powerful
influences
he
knew
well
but
reviewing
the
precautions
which
he
had
taken
kerry
determined
that
the
trump
card
was
in
his
possession
the
chinese
servant
descended
the
stairs
again
and
intimated
that
the
visitor
should
follow
him
kerry
carrying
his
hat
and
cane
mounted
the
stairs
walked
along
the
carpeted
passage
and
was
ushered
into
a
queer
low
room
furnished
as
a
library
it
was
lined
with
shelves
containing
books
none
of
which
appeared
to
be
english
upon
the
top
of
the
shelves
were
grotesque
figures
of
gods
pieces
of
chinese
pottery
and
other
oriental
ornaments
arms
there
were
in
the
room
and
rich
carpets
carven
furniture
and
an
air
of
luxury
peculiarly
exotic
furthermore
he
detected
a
faint
smell
of
opium
from
which
fact
he
divined
that
zani
chada
was
addicted
to
the
national
vice
of
china
seated
before
a
long
narrow
table
was
the
notorious
eurasian
the
table
contained
a
number
of
strange
and
unfamiliar
objects
as
well
as
a
small
rack
of
books
an
opium
pipe
rested
in
a
porcelain
bowl
zani
chada
wearing
a
blue
robe
sat
in
a
cushioned
chair
staring
toward
the
chief
inspector
with
one
slender
yellow
hand
he
brushed
his
untidy
gray
hair
his
long
magnetic
eyes
were
half
closed
good
evening
chief
inspector
kerry
he
said
wo
you
be
seated
thanks
i
not
staying
i
can
hear
what
you
got
to
say
the
long
eyes
grew
a
little
more
narrow
the
only
change
of
expression
that
zani
chada
allowed
himself
as
you
wish
i
have
no
occasion
to
detain
you
in
that
queer
perfumed
room
with
the
suggestion
of
something
sinister
underlying
its
exotic
luxury
arose
a
kind
of
astral
clash
as
the
powerful
personality
of
the
eurasian
came
in
contact
with
that
of
kerry
in
a
sense
it
was
a
contest
of
rapier
and
an
insidious
but
powerful
will
enlisted
against
the
bulldog
force
of
the
chief
inspector
still
through
eyes
zani
chada
watched
his
visitor
who
stood
feet
apart
and
chin
thrust
forward
aggressively
staring
with
wide
open
fierce
blue
eyes
at
the
other
i
going
to
say
one
thing
declared
kerry
snapping
out
the
words
in
a
manner
little
short
of
ferocious
he
laid
his
hat
and
cane
upon
a
chair
and
took
a
step
in
the
direction
of
the
narrow
laden
table
make
me
any
kind
of
offer
to
buy
back
the
evidence
you
think
i
got
and
i
bash
your
face
as
flat
as
a
the
yellow
hands
of
zani
chada
clutched
the
metal
knobs
which
ornamented
the
arms
of
the
chair
in
which
he
was
seated
the
long
eyes
now
presented
the
appearance
of
being
entirely
closed
otherwise
he
remained
immovable
following
a
short
portentous
silence
how
grossly
you
misunderstood
me
chief
inspector
chada
replied
speaking
very
softly
you
are
shortly
to
be
promoted
to
a
post
which
no
one
is
better
fitted
to
occupy
you
enjoy
great
domestic
happiness
and
you
possess
a
son
in
whom
you
repose
great
hopes
in
this
respect
chief
inspector
i
resemble
kerry
nostrils
were
widely
dilated
but
he
did
not
speak
you
see
continued
the
eurasian
i
know
many
things
about
you
indeed
i
have
watched
your
career
with
interest
now
to
be
brief
a
great
scandal
may
be
averted
and
a
woman
reputation
preserved
if
you
and
i
as
men
of
the
world
can
succeed
in
understanding
one
i
do
want
to
understand
you
said
kerry
bluntly
but
you
said
enough
already
to
justify
me
in
blowing
this
he
drew
a
police
whistle
from
his
overcoat
pocket
this
house
is
being
i
am
aware
of
the
fact
murmured
zani
chada
there
are
two
people
in
it
i
want
for
two
different
reasons
if
you
say
much
more
there
may
be
chada
raised
his
hand
slowly
put
back
your
whistle
chief
there
was
a
curious
restraint
in
the
eurasian
manner
which
kerry
distrusted
but
for
which
at
the
time
he
was
at
a
loss
to
account
then
suddenly
he
determined
that
the
man
was
waiting
for
something
listening
for
some
sound
as
if
to
confirm
this
reasoning
just
at
that
moment
a
sound
indeed
broke
the
silence
of
the
room
somewhere
far
away
in
the
distance
of
the
big
house
a
gong
was
beaten
three
times
softly
kerry
fierce
glance
searched
the
face
of
zani
chada
but
it
remained
immovable
yet
that
this
had
been
a
signal
of
some
kind
the
chief
inspector
did
not
doubt
and
you
ca
trick
me
he
said
fiercely
no
one
can
leave
this
house
without
my
knowledge
and
because
of
what
happened
out
there
in
the
fog
my
hands
are
he
took
up
his
hat
and
cane
from
the
chair
i
going
to
search
the
premises
he
declared
zani
chada
stood
up
slowly
chief
inspector
he
said
i
advise
you
to
do
nothing
until
you
have
consulted
your
consulted
my
wife
snapped
kerry
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
any
steps
you
may
take
now
can
only
lead
to
disaster
for
many
and
in
your
own
case
to
great
kerry
took
a
step
forward
two
steps
then
paused
he
was
considering
certain
words
which
the
eurasian
had
spoken
without
fearing
the
man
in
the
physical
sense
he
was
not
fool
enough
to
underestimate
his
potentialities
for
evil
and
his
power
to
strike
darkly
act
as
you
please
added
zani
chada
speaking
even
more
softly
but
i
have
not
advised
lightly
i
will
receive
you
chief
inspector
at
any
hour
of
the
night
you
care
to
return
by
if
you
wish
you
may
be
independent
of
kerry
clenched
his
fists
and
great
sorrow
may
be
spared
to
others
concluded
the
eurasian
kerry
teeth
snapped
together
audibly
then
putting
on
his
hat
he
turned
and
walked
straight
to
the
door
v
dan
kerry
junior
dan
kerry
junior
was
humorously
like
his
father
except
that
he
was
and
promised
to
grow
into
a
much
bigger
man
his
hair
was
uncompromisingly
red
and
grew
in
such
irregular
fashion
that
the
comb
was
not
made
which
could
subdue
it
he
had
the
fighting
blue
eyes
of
the
chief
inspector
and
when
he
smiled
the
presence
of
two
broken
teeth
lent
him
a
very
pugilistic
appearance
on
his
advent
at
the
school
of
which
he
was
now
one
of
the
most
popular
members
he
had
promptly
been
christened
to
this
nickname
young
kerry
had
always
taken
exception
and
he
proceeded
to
display
his
prejudice
on
the
first
day
of
his
arrival
with
such
force
and
determination
that
the
sobriquet
had
been
withdrawn
by
tacit
consent
of
every
member
of
the
form
who
hitherto
had
favoured
it
i
take
you
all
on
the
new
arrival
had
declared
amidst
a
silence
of
stupefaction
starting
with
you
pointing
to
the
biggest
boy
if
we
do
finish
i
begin
again
the
sheer
impudence
of
the
thing
had
astounded
everybody
young
treatment
of
his
leading
persecutor
had
produced
a
salutary
change
of
opinion
of
such
kidney
was
daniel
kerry
junior
and
when
some
hours
after
his
father
departure
on
the
night
of
the
murder
in
the
fog
the
bell
rang
it
was
dan
junior
and
not
his
mother
who
answered
the
call
hallo
said
a
voice
is
that
chief
inspector
kerry
house
yes
replied
dan
it
has
begun
to
rain
in
town
the
voice
continued
is
that
the
chief
inspector
son
speaking
yes
i
daniel
well
my
boy
you
know
the
way
to
new
scotland
yard
he
says
will
you
bring
his
overall
do
you
know
where
to
find
it
yes
yes
cried
dan
excitedly
delighted
to
be
thus
made
a
party
to
his
father
activities
well
get
it
jump
on
a
tram
at
the
town
hall
and
bring
the
overall
along
here
your
mother
will
not
object
will
she
of
course
not
cried
dan
i
tell
her
am
i
to
start
now
yes
right
kerry
was
sewing
by
the
fire
in
the
dining
room
when
her
son
came
in
with
the
news
his
blue
eyes
sparkling
excitedly
she
nodded
her
head
slowly
ye
want
burberry
and
thick
boots
she
declared
a
muffler
too
and
oldest
cap
i
think
it
madness
for
ye
to
go
out
on
such
a
night
but
father
said
i
could
protested
the
boy
he
says
so
and
ye
shall
go
but
i
think
it
madness
a
the
however
some
ten
minutes
later
young
kerry
set
out
keenly
resenting
the
woollen
muffler
which
he
had
been
compelled
to
wear
and
secretly
determined
to
remove
it
before
mounting
the
tram
across
one
arm
he
carried
the
glistening
overall
which
was
the
chief
inspector
constant
companion
on
wet
nights
abroad
the
fog
had
turned
denser
and
ten
paces
from
the
door
of
the
house
took
him
out
of
sight
of
the
light
streaming
from
the
hallway
mary
kerry
well
knew
her
husband
theories
about
coddling
boys
but
even
so
could
not
entirely
reconcile
herself
to
the
present
expedition
however
closing
the
door
she
returned
philosophically
to
her
sewing
reflecting
that
little
harm
could
come
to
dan
after
all
for
he
was
strong
healthy
and
intelligent
on
went
the
boy
through
the
mist
whistling
merrily
not
twenty
yards
from
the
house
a
coupe
was
drawn
up
and
by
the
light
of
one
of
its
lamps
a
man
was
consulting
a
piece
of
paper
on
which
presumably
an
address
was
written
for
as
the
boy
approached
the
man
turned
his
collar
pulled
up
about
his
face
his
hat
pulled
down
hallo
he
called
can
you
please
tell
me
something
he
spoke
with
a
curious
accent
unfamiliar
to
the
boy
a
foreigner
of
some
kind
young
kerry
determined
what
is
it
he
asked
pausing
will
you
please
read
and
tell
me
if
i
am
near
this
place
the
man
continued
holding
up
the
paper
which
he
had
been
scrutinizing
dan
stepped
forward
and
bent
over
it
he
could
not
make
out
the
writing
and
bent
yet
more
holding
it
nearer
to
the
lamp
at
which
moment
some
second
person
neatly
pinioned
him
from
behind
a
scarf
was
whipped
about
his
head
and
kicking
furiously
but
otherwise
helpless
he
felt
himself
lifted
and
placed
inside
the
car
the
muffler
had
been
thrown
in
such
fashion
about
his
face
as
to
leave
one
eye
partly
free
and
as
he
was
lifted
he
had
a
momentary
glimpse
of
his
captors
with
a
thrill
of
real
sickly
terror
he
realized
that
he
was
in
the
hands
of
chinamen
perhaps
telepathically
this
spasm
of
fear
was
conveyed
to
his
father
for
it
was
at
about
this
time
that
the
latter
was
interviewing
zani
chada
and
at
about
this
time
that
kerry
recognized
underlying
the
other
words
at
once
an
suspense
and
a
threat
then
a
few
minutes
later
had
come
the
three
strokes
of
the
gong
and
again
that
unreasonable
dread
had
assailed
him
perhaps
because
it
signalized
the
capture
of
his
son
news
of
which
had
been
immediately
telephoned
to
limehouse
by
zani
chada
orders
certain
it
is
that
kerry
left
the
eurasian
house
in
a
frame
of
mind
which
was
not
familiar
to
him
he
was
undecided
respecting
his
next
move
a
deadly
menace
underlay
chada
words
consult
your
wife
he
kept
muttering
to
himself
when
the
door
was
opened
for
him
by
the
chinese
servant
he
paused
a
moment
before
going
out
into
the
fog
there
were
men
on
duty
at
the
back
and
at
the
front
of
the
house
should
he
risk
all
and
raid
the
place
that
lady
rourke
was
captive
here
he
no
longer
doubted
but
it
was
equally
certain
that
no
further
harm
would
come
to
her
at
the
hands
of
her
captors
since
she
had
been
traced
there
and
since
zani
chada
was
well
aware
of
the
fact
of
the
whereabouts
of
lou
chada
he
could
not
be
certain
if
he
was
in
the
house
they
had
him
the
door
was
closed
by
the
chinaman
and
kerry
stood
out
in
the
darkness
of
the
dismal
street
feeling
something
as
nearly
akin
to
dejection
as
was
possible
in
one
of
his
mercurial
spirit
something
trickled
upon
the
brim
of
his
hat
and
raising
his
head
kerry
detected
rain
upon
his
upturned
face
he
breathed
a
prayer
of
thankfulness
this
would
put
an
end
to
the
fog
he
began
to
walk
along
by
the
high
brick
wall
but
had
not
proceeded
far
before
a
muffled
figure
arose
before
him
and
the
light
of
an
electric
torch
was
shone
into
his
face
oh
it
you
chief
inspector
came
the
voice
of
the
watcher
it
is
rapped
kerry
unless
there
are
tunnels
under
this
old
i
take
it
the
men
on
duty
can
cover
all
the
exits
all
the
main
exits
was
the
reply
but
as
you
say
it
a
strange
house
and
zani
chada
has
a
stranger
do
nothing
until
you
hear
from
very
good
chief
the
rain
now
was
definitely
conquering
the
fog
and
in
half
the
time
which
had
been
occupied
by
the
outward
journey
kerry
was
back
again
in
limehouse
police
station
unconsciously
he
had
been
hastening
his
pace
with
every
stride
urged
onward
by
an
unaccountable
anxiety
so
that
finally
he
almost
ran
into
the
office
and
up
to
the
desk
where
the
telephone
stood
lifting
it
he
called
his
own
number
and
stood
tapping
his
foot
impatiently
awaiting
the
reply
presently
came
the
voice
of
the
operator
have
they
answered
yet
i
will
ring
them
kerry
anxiety
became
acute
almost
unendurable
and
when
at
last
after
repeated
attempts
no
reply
could
be
obtained
from
his
home
he
replaced
the
receiver
and
leaned
for
a
moment
on
the
desk
shaken
with
such
a
storm
of
apprehension
as
he
had
rarely
known
he
turned
to
the
inspector
in
charge
and
let
me
have
that
envelope
i
left
with
you
he
directed
and
have
someone
for
a
taxi
they
are
to
keep
on
till
they
get
one
where
is
sergeant
durham
at
the
ah
any
developments
chief
inspector
yes
but
apart
from
keeping
a
close
watch
upon
the
house
of
zani
chada
you
are
to
do
nothing
until
you
hear
from
me
very
good
said
the
inspector
are
you
going
to
wait
for
report
no
directly
the
cab
arrives
i
am
going
to
wait
for
indeed
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
like
a
wild
beast
caged
while
call
after
call
was
sent
to
neighbouring
cab
ranks
for
a
long
time
without
result
what
did
it
mean
his
wife
failure
to
answer
the
telephone
it
might
mean
that
neither
she
nor
their
one
servant
nor
dan
was
in
the
house
and
if
they
were
not
in
the
house
at
this
hour
of
the
night
where
could
they
possibly
be
this
it
might
mean
or
something
worse
a
thousand
and
one
possibilities
hideous
fantastic
appalling
flashed
through
his
mind
he
was
beginning
to
learn
what
zani
chada
had
meant
when
he
had
said
i
have
followed
your
career
with
at
last
a
taxi
was
found
and
the
man
instructed
over
the
to
proceed
immediately
to
limehouse
station
he
seemed
so
long
in
coming
that
when
at
last
the
cab
was
heard
to
pause
outside
kerry
could
not
trust
himself
to
speak
to
the
driver
but
directed
a
sergeant
to
give
him
the
address
he
entered
silently
and
closed
the
door
a
steady
drizzle
of
rain
was
falling
it
had
already
dispersed
the
fog
so
that
he
might
hope
with
luck
to
be
home
within
the
hour
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
man
performed
the
journey
in
excellent
time
but
it
seemed
to
his
passenger
that
he
could
have
walked
quicker
such
was
the
gnawing
anxiety
within
him
and
the
fear
which
prompted
him
to
long
for
wings
instructing
the
cabman
to
wait
kerry
unlocked
the
front
door
and
entered
he
had
noted
a
light
in
the
dining
room
window
and
entering
he
found
his
wife
awaiting
him
there
she
rose
as
he
entered
with
horror
in
her
comely
face
dan
she
whispered
dan
where
is
mackintosh
i
did
take
it
he
replied
endeavouring
to
tell
himself
that
his
apprehensions
had
been
groundless
but
how
was
it
that
you
did
not
answer
the
telephone
what
do
ye
mean
dan
mary
kerry
stared
her
eyes
growing
wider
and
wider
the
boy
answered
dan
he
set
out
wi
mackintosh
full
an
hour
and
a
half
what
the
truth
leaped
out
at
kerry
like
an
enemy
out
of
ambush
who
sent
that
message
someone
frae
the
yard
to
tell
the
boy
to
bring
mackintosh
alone
at
once
dan
dan
she
advanced
hands
outstretched
quivering
but
kerry
had
leaped
out
into
the
narrow
hallway
he
raised
the
telephone
receiver
listened
for
a
moment
and
then
jerked
it
back
upon
the
hook
dead
line
he
muttered
someone
has
been
at
work
with
a
outside
the
house
his
wife
came
out
to
where
he
stood
and
clenching
his
teeth
very
grimly
he
took
her
in
his
arms
she
was
shaking
as
if
palsied
mary
dear
he
said
pray
with
all
your
might
that
i
am
given
strength
to
do
my
she
looked
at
him
with
haggard
tearless
eyes
tell
me
the
truth
ha
they
got
my
boy
his
fingers
tightened
on
her
shoulders
do
worry
he
said
and
do
ask
me
to
stay
to
explain
when
i
come
back
i
have
dan
with
me
he
trusted
himself
no
further
but
clapping
his
hat
on
his
head
walked
out
to
the
waiting
cab
back
to
limehouse
police
station
he
directed
rapidly
lor
lumme
muttered
the
taximan
where
are
you
goin
to
after
that
it
a
bit
off
the
i
going
to
hell
rapped
kerry
suddenly
thrusting
his
red
face
very
near
to
that
of
the
speaker
and
you
going
to
drive
me
vi
the
knight
errant
recognizing
the
superior
strength
of
his
captors
young
kerry
soon
gave
up
struggling
the
thrill
of
his
first
real
adventure
entered
into
his
blood
he
remembered
that
he
was
the
son
of
his
father
and
he
realized
being
a
lad
that
he
was
in
the
grip
of
enemies
of
his
father
the
panic
which
had
threatened
him
when
first
he
had
recognized
that
he
was
in
the
hands
of
chinese
gave
place
to
a
cold
rage
a
heritage
which
in
later
years
was
to
make
him
a
dangerous
man
he
lay
quite
passively
in
the
grasp
of
someone
who
held
him
fast
and
learned
by
breathing
quietly
that
the
presence
of
the
muffler
about
his
nose
and
mouth
did
not
greatly
inconvenience
him
there
was
some
desultory
conversation
between
the
two
men
in
the
car
but
it
was
carried
on
in
an
odd
sibilant
language
which
the
boy
did
not
understand
but
which
he
divined
to
be
chinese
he
thought
how
every
other
boy
in
the
school
would
envy
him
and
the
thought
was
stimulating
nerving
on
the
very
first
day
of
his
holidays
he
was
become
the
central
figure
of
a
chinatown
drama
the
last
traces
of
fear
fled
his
position
was
uncomfortable
and
his
limbs
were
cramped
but
he
resigned
himself
with
something
almost
like
gladness
and
began
to
look
forward
to
that
which
lay
ahead
with
a
zest
and
a
will
to
be
no
passive
instrument
which
might
have
surprised
his
captors
could
they
have
read
the
mind
of
their
captive
the
journey
seemed
almost
interminable
but
young
kerry
suffered
it
in
stoical
silence
until
the
car
stopped
and
he
was
lifted
and
carried
down
stone
steps
into
some
damp
place
some
distance
was
traversed
and
then
many
flights
of
stairs
were
mounted
some
bare
but
others
carpeted
finally
he
was
deposited
in
a
chair
and
as
he
raised
his
hand
to
the
scarf
which
toward
the
end
of
the
journey
had
been
bound
more
tightly
about
his
head
so
as
to
prevent
him
from
seeing
at
all
he
heard
a
door
closed
and
locked
the
scarf
was
quickly
removed
and
dan
found
himself
in
a
attic
having
a
sloping
roof
and
one
shuttered
window
a
shadeless
electric
lamp
hung
from
the
ceiling
excepting
the
chair
in
which
he
had
been
deposited
and
a
certain
amount
of
nondescript
lumber
the
attic
was
unfurnished
dan
rapidly
considered
what
his
father
would
have
done
in
the
circumstances
make
sure
that
the
door
is
locked
he
muttered
he
tried
it
and
it
was
locked
beyond
any
shadow
of
doubt
the
shutters
covered
it
and
these
were
fastened
with
a
padlock
he
considered
this
padlock
attentively
then
drawing
from
his
pocket
one
of
those
wonderful
knives
which
are
really
miniature
he
raised
from
a
grove
the
which
formed
part
of
its
equipment
and
with
neatness
and
dispatch
unscrewed
the
staple
to
which
the
padlock
was
attached
a
moment
later
he
had
opened
the
shutters
and
was
looking
out
into
the
drizzle
of
the
night
the
room
in
which
he
was
confined
was
on
the
third
floor
of
a
dingy
house
a
portion
of
some
other
building
faced
him
down
below
was
a
courtyard
to
the
left
stood
a
high
wall
and
beyond
it
he
obtained
a
glimpse
of
other
dingy
buildings
one
lighted
window
was
visible
a
square
window
in
the
opposite
building
from
which
amber
light
shone
out
somewhere
in
the
street
beyond
was
a
standard
lamp
he
could
detect
the
halo
which
it
cast
into
the
misty
rain
the
glass
was
very
dirty
and
young
kerry
raised
the
sash
admitting
a
draught
of
damp
cold
air
into
the
room
he
craned
out
looking
about
him
eagerly
a
was
within
reach
of
his
hand
on
the
right
of
the
window
and
leaning
out
still
farther
young
kerry
saw
that
it
passed
beside
two
other
larger
windows
on
the
floor
beneath
him
neither
of
these
showed
any
light
dizzy
heights
have
no
terror
for
healthy
youth
the
brackets
supporting
the
were
a
sufficient
staircase
for
the
agile
dan
a
more
slippery
prisoner
than
the
famous
baron
trenck
and
discarding
his
muffler
and
his
burberry
he
climbed
out
upon
the
sill
and
felt
with
his
boots
for
the
first
of
these
footholds
clutching
the
ledge
he
lowered
himself
and
felt
for
the
next
then
came
the
moment
when
he
must
trust
all
his
weight
to
the
pipe
clenching
his
teeth
he
risked
it
felt
for
and
found
the
third
angle
and
then
still
clutching
the
pipe
stood
for
a
moment
upon
the
ledge
of
the
window
immediately
beneath
him
he
was
curious
respecting
the
lighted
window
of
the
neighbouring
house
and
twisting
about
he
bent
peering
across
and
saw
a
sight
which
arrested
his
progress
the
room
within
was
furnished
in
a
way
which
made
him
gasp
with
astonishment
it
was
like
an
eastern
picture
he
thought
her
golden
hair
dishevelled
and
her
hands
alternately
clenching
and
unclenching
a
woman
whom
he
considered
to
be
most
wonderfully
dressed
was
pacing
wildly
up
and
down
a
look
of
such
horror
upon
her
pale
face
that
heart
seemed
to
stop
beating
for
a
moment
here
was
real
trouble
of
a
sort
which
appealed
to
all
the
chivalry
in
the
boy
nature
he
considered
the
window
which
was
glazed
with
glass
observed
that
it
was
sufficiently
open
to
enable
him
to
slip
the
fastening
and
open
it
entirely
could
he
but
reach
it
and
yes
there
was
a
climbing
down
to
the
yard
he
looked
quickly
about
him
ran
across
and
climbed
up
to
the
lighted
window
a
moment
later
he
had
pushed
it
widely
open
he
was
greeted
by
a
stifled
cry
but
cautiously
transferring
his
weight
from
the
friendly
pipe
to
the
ledge
he
got
astride
of
it
one
foot
in
the
room
then
by
exercise
of
a
agility
he
wriggled
his
head
and
shoulders
within
it
all
right
he
said
softly
and
reassuringly
i
dan
kerry
son
of
chief
inspector
kerry
can
i
be
of
any
assistance
her
hands
clasped
convulsively
together
the
woman
stood
looking
up
at
him
oh
thank
god
said
the
captive
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
can
you
get
me
out
do
worry
replied
dan
confidently
father
and
i
can
manage
it
all
right
he
performed
a
singular
contortion
as
a
result
of
which
his
other
leg
and
foot
appeared
inside
the
window
then
twisting
around
he
lowered
himself
and
dropped
triumphantly
upon
a
cushioned
divan
at
that
moment
he
would
have
faced
a
cage
full
of
tigers
the
spirit
of
adventure
had
him
in
its
grip
he
stood
up
breathing
rapidly
his
crop
of
red
hair
more
dishevelled
than
usual
then
before
he
could
stir
or
utter
any
protest
the
princess
whom
he
had
come
to
rescue
stooped
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
kissed
him
you
darling
brave
boy
she
said
i
think
you
have
saved
me
from
young
kerry
more
flushed
than
ever
extricated
himself
and
you
not
out
of
the
mess
yet
he
protested
the
only
difference
is
that
i
in
it
with
you
but
where
is
your
father
i
looking
for
what
oh
he
about
somewhere
dan
assured
her
confidently
but
but
she
was
gazing
at
him
did
he
send
you
here
you
bet
he
did
returned
young
kerry
i
came
here
on
my
own
accord
and
when
i
go
you
coming
with
me
i
ca
make
out
how
you
got
here
anyway
do
you
know
whose
house
this
is
oh
i
do
i
do
whose
it
belongs
to
a
man
called
chada
never

of
him
but
i
mean
what
part
of
london

it
in
whatever
do
you
mean

in
limehouse
i
believe
i
understand

i
did
said
young
kerry
cheerfully
i
was
fetched
by
your
father
not
on
your
life
by
a
couple
of
chinks
i
tell
you
he
raised
his
twinkling
blue
eyes
we
are
properly
up
against
it
i
suppose
you
could
climb
down
a
vii
retribution
it
was
that
dark
still
depressing
hour
of
the
night
when
all
life
is
at
its
lowest
ebb
in
the
low
strangely
perfumed
room
of
books
zani
chada
sat
before
his
table
his
yellow
hands
clutching
the
knobs
on
his
chair
arms
his
long
inscrutable
eyes
staring
unseeingly
before
him
came
a
disturbance
and
the
sound
of
voices
and
lou
chada
his
son
stood
at
the
doorway
he
still
wore
his
evening
clothes
but
he
no
longer
looked
smart
his
glossy
black
hair
was
dishevelled
and
his
handsome
olive
face
bore
a
hunted
look
panic
was
betoken
by
twitching
mouth
and
eyes
he
stopped
glaring
at
his
father
and
why
are
you
not
gone
asked
the
latter
sternly
do
you
wish
to
wreck
me
as
well
as
yourself
the
police
have
posted
a
man
opposite
kwee
house
i
can
not
get
out
that
there
was
no
one
there
when
the
boy
was
brought

but
there
is
now
father
he
took
a
step
forward
i
trapped
they
take
me
you
wo
let
them
take
me
zani
chada
stirred
not
a
muscle
but
he
said
your
mad
passion
has
brought
ruin
to
both
of
us
for
the
sake
of
a
golden
doll
who
is
not
worth
the
price
of
the
jewels
she
wears
you
have
placed
yourself
within
reach
of
the
i
was
mad
i
was
mad
groaned
the
other
but
i
who
was
sane
am
involved
in
the
consequences
retorted
his
father
he
will
be
silent
at
the
price
of
the
boy
he
may
be
returned
zani
chada
i
hate
him
but
he
is
a
man
had
you
escaped
he
might
have
consented
to
be
silent
once
you
are
arrested
nothing
would
silence
if
the
case
is
tried
it
will
ruin
pat
what
a
pity
said
zani
chada
in
some
distant
part
of
the
house

gong
was
struck
three
times

commanded
his
father

at
kwee
house
until

send
for
you
let
ah
fang
go
to
the
room
above
and
see
that
the
woman
is
silent
an
outcry
would
ruin
our
last
lou
chada
raised
his
hands
brushing
the
hair
back
from
his
wet
forehead
then
staring
haggardly
at
his
father
turned
and
ran
from
the
room
a
minute
later
kerry
was
ushered
in
by
the
chinese
servant
the
savage
face
was
set
like
a
mask
without
removing
his
hat
he
strode
across
to
the
table
and
bent
down
so
that
fierce
blue
eyes
stared
closely
into
long
black
ones
i
got
one
thing
to
say
explained
kerry
huskily
whatever
the
hangman
may
do
to
your
slimy
son
and
whatever
happens
to
the
little
blonde
fool
he
kidnapped
if
you
laid
a
hand
on
my
kid
i
kick
you
to
death
if
i
follow
you
round
the
world
to
do
zani
chada
made
no
reply
but
his
knuckles
gleamed
so
tightly
did
he
clutch
the
knobs
on
the
chair
arms
kerry
savagery
would
have
awed
any
man
even
though
he
had
supposed
it
to
be
the
idle
threat
of
a
passionate
man
but
zani
chada
knew
all
men
and
he
knew
this
one
when
daniel
kerry
declared
that
in
given
circumstances
he
would
kick
zani
chada
to
death
he
did
not
mean
that
he
would
shoot
him
strangle
him
or
even
beat
him
with
his
fists
he
meant
precisely
what
he
said
that
he
would
kick
him
to
death
and
zani
chada
knew
it
thus
there
were
some
moments
of
tense
silence
during
which
the
savage
face
of
the
chief
inspector
drew
even
closer
to
the
gaunt
yellow
face
of
the
eurasian
finally
listen
only
for
one
moment
said
zani
chada
his
voice
had
lost
its
guttural
intonation
he
spoke
softly
sibilantly
i
too
am
a
father
do
mince
words
shouted
kerry
you
kidnapped
my
boy
if
i
have
to
tear
your
house
down
brick
by
brick
i
find
him
and
if
you
hurt
one
hair
of
his
head
you
know
what
to
expect
he
quivered
the
effort
of
suppression
which
he
had
imposed
upon
himself
was
frightful
to
witness
zani
chada
student
of
men
knew
that
in
despite
of
his
own
physical
strength
and
of
the
hidden
resources
at
his
beck
he
stood
nearer
to
primitive
retribution
than
he
had
ever
done
yet
i
understand
he
continued
but
you
do
not
understand
your
boy
is
not
in
this
house
oh
violence
can
not
avail
it
can
only
make
his
loss
kerry
nostrils
distended
eyes
glaring
madly
bent
over
him
your
scallywag
of
a
son
he
said
hoarsely
has
gone
one
step
too
far
his
adventures
have
twice
before
ended
in
murder
and
you
have
covered
him
this
time
you
ca
do
it
i
not
to
be
bought
we
stood
for
the
far
east
in
london
long
enough
your
cub
hangs
this
time
get
me
there
be
no
bargaining
the
woman
reputation
wo
stop
me
my
kid
danger
wo
stop
me
but
if
you
try
to
use
him
as
a
lever
boot
you
to
your
stinking
yellow
paradise
and
they
check
you
in
as
you
speak
of
three
deaths
murmured
zani
chada
kerry
clenched
his
teeth
so
tightly
that
his
maxillary
muscles
protruded
to
an
abnormal
degree
he
thrust
his
clenched
fists
into
his
coat
pockets
we
all
follow
our
vocations
in
life
resumed
the
eurasian
to
the
best
of
our
abilities
but
is
professional
kudos
not
too
dearly
bought
at
the
price
of
a
loved
one
lost
for
ever
a
far
better
bargain
would
be
shall
we
say
ten
thousand
pounds
as
the
price
of
a
silk
handkerchief
kerry
fierce
blue
eyes
closed
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
yet
in
that
fraction
of
a
second
he
had
visualized
some
of
the
things
which
ten
thousand
pounds
a
sum
he
could
never
hope
to
possess
would
buy
he
had
seen
his
home
as
he
would
have
it
and
he
had
seen
dan
there
safe
and
happy
at
his
mother
side
was
he
entitled
to
disregard
the
happiness
of
his
wife
the
life
of
his
boy
the
honourable
name
of
sir
noel
rourke
because
an
outcast
like
peters
had
come
to
a
fitting
end
because
a
treacherous
malay
and
a
renegade
chinaman
had
earlier
gone
the
same
way
sped
as
he
suspected
by
the
same
hand
my
resources
are
unusual
added
chada
speaking
almost
in
a
whisper
i
have
cash
to
this
amount
in
my
safe
so
far
he
had
proceeded
when
he
was
interrupted
and
the
cause
of
the
interruption
was
this
a
few
moments
earlier
another
dramatic
encounter
had
taken
place
in
a
distant
part
of
the
house
kerry
junior
having
scientifically
tested
all
the
possible
modes
of
egress
from
the
room
in
which
lady
pat
was
confined
had
long
ago
desisted
and
had
exhausted
his
ingenuity
in
plans
which
discussion
had
proved
to
be
useless
in
spite
of
the
novelty
and
the
danger
of
his
situation
nature
was
urging
her
laws
he
was
growing
sleepy
the
crowning
tragedy
had
been
the
discovery
that
he
could
not
regain
the
small
square
window
set
high
in
the
wall
from
which
he
had
dropped
into
this
luxurious
prison
now
as
the
two
sat
side
by
side
upon
a
cushioned
divan
the
woman
arm
about
the
shoulders
they
were
startled
to
hear
in
the
depths
of
the
house
three
notes
of
a
gong
young
kerry
sleepiness
departed
he
leapt
to
his
feet
as
though
electrified
what
was
that
there
was
something
horrifying
in
those
gong
notes
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
lady
pat
beautiful
eyes
grew
glassy
with
fear
i
do
know
replied
dan
it
seemed
to
come
from
he
ran
to
the
door
drew
the
curtain
aside
and
pressed
his
ear
against
one
of
the
panels
listening
intently
as
he
did
so
his
attitude
grew
tense
his
expression
changed
then
we
saved
he
cried
turning
a
radiant
face
to
the
woman
i
heard
my
father
voice
oh
are
you
sure
are
you
sure
absolutely
sure
he
bent
to
press
his
ear
to
the
panel
again
when
a
stifled
cry
from
his
companion
brought
him
swiftly
to
his
feet
the
second
door
in
the
room
had
opened
silently
and
a
small
chinaman
who
carried
himself
with
a
stoop
had
entered
and
now
a
menacing
expression
upon
his
face
was
quickly
approaching
the
boy
what
he
had
meant
to
do
for
ever
remained
in
doubt
for
young
kerry
knowing
his
father
to
be
in
the
house
and
seeing
an
open
door
before
him
took
matters
into
his
own
hands
at
the
moment
that
the
silent
chinaman
was
about
to
throw
his
arms
about
him
the
pride
of
the
junior
school
registered
a
most
surprising
left
accurately
on
the
point
of
ah
fang
jaw
following
it
up
by
a
wilful
transgression
of
queensberry
rules
in
the
form
of
a
stomach
punch
which
temporarily
decided
the
issue
then
quick
quick
he
cried
breathlessly
grasping
lady
pat
hand
this
is
where
we
run
in
such
fashion
was
zani
chada
interrupted
the
interruption
taking
the
form
of
a
sudden
shrill
outcry
dad
dad
where
are
you
dad
kerry
spun
about
as
a
man
galvanized
his
face
became
transfigured
this
way
dan
he
cried
this
way
boy
came
a
clatter
of
hurrying
feet
and
into
the
low
perfumed
room
burst
dan
kerry
junior
tightly
clasping
the
hand
of
a
dishevelled
woman
in
evening
dress
it
was
lady
rourke
and
although
she
seemed
to
be
in
a
nearly
fainting
condition
dan
dragged
her
half
running
into
the
room
kerry
gave
one
glance
at
the
pair
then
instantly
he
turned
to
face
zani
chada
the
latter
like
a
man
of
stone
sat
in
his
carved
chair
eyes
nearly
closed
the
chief
inspector
whipped
out
a
whistle
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
he
blew
three
blasts
upon
it
from
one
two
three
four
points
around
the
house
the
signal
was
answered
zani
chada
fully
opened
his
long
basilisk
eyes
you
win
chief
inspector
he
said
but
much
may
be
done
by
clever
counsel
if
all
fails
well
rapped
kerry
fiercely
at
the
same
time
throwing
his
arm
around
the
boy
i
may
continue
to
take
an
interest
in
your
a
tremendous
uproar
arose
within
and
without
the
house
the
police
were
raiding
the
place
lady
rourke
sank
down
slowly
almost
at
the
eurasian
feet
but
chief
inspector
kerry
experienced
an
unfamiliar
chill
as
his
uncompromising
stare
met
the
cold
hatred
which
blazed
out
of
the
black
eyes
narrowed
now
and
serpentine
of
zani
chada
the
pigtail
of
hi
wing
ho
i
how
i
obtained
it
leaving
the
dock
gates
behind
me
i
tramped
through
the
steady
drizzle
going
parallel
with
the
river
and
making
for
the
chinese
quarter
the
hour
was
about
eleven
on
one
of
those
september
nights
when
in
such
a
locality
as
this
a
stifling
quality
seems
to
enter
the
atmosphere
rendering
it
all
but
unbreathable
a
mist
floated
over
the
river
and
it
was
difficult
to
say
if
the
rain
was
still
falling
indeed
or
if
the
ample
moisture
upon
my
garments
was
traceable
only
to
the
fog
sounds
were
muffled
lights
dimmed
and
the
frequent
hooting
of
sirens
from
the
river
added
another
touch
of
weirdness
to
the
scene
even
when
the
peculiar
duties
of
my
friend
paul
harley
called
him
away
from
england
the
lure
of
this
miniature
orient
which
i
had
first
explored
under
his
guidance
often
called
me
from
my
chambers
in
the
house
with
the
two
doors
in
wade
street
limehouse
i
would
discard
the
armour
of
respectability
and
dressed
in
a
manner
unlikely
to
provoke
comment
in
dockland
would
haunt
those
dreary
ways
sometimes
from
midnight
until
close
upon
dawn
yet
well
as
i
knew
the
district
and
the
strange
and
often
dangerous
creatures
lurking
in
its
many
burrows
i
experienced
a
chill
partly
physical
and
partly
of
apprehension
indeed
strange
though
it
may
sound
i
hastened
my
footsteps
in
order
the
sooner
to
reach
the
low
den
for
which
i
was
bound
malay
jack
a
spot
marked
plainly
on
the
and
which
few
respectable
travellers
would
have
regarded
as
a
haven
of
refuge
but
the
chill
of
the
adjacent
river
and
some
quality
of
utter
desolation
which
seemed
to
emanate
from
the
deserted
wharves
and
ramshackle
buildings
about
me
were
driving
me
thither
now
for
i
knew
that
human
companionship
of
a
sort
and
a
glass
of
good
liquor
from
a
store
which
the
customs
would
have
been
happy
to
locate
awaited
me
there
i
might
chance
too
upon
durham
or
wessex
of
new
scotland
yard
both
good
friends
of
mine
or
even
upon
the
terror
of
chinatown
chief
inspector
kerry
a
man
for
whom
i
had
an
esteem
which
none
of
his
ungracious
manners
could
diminish
i
was
just
about
to
turn
to
the
right
into
a
narrow
and
nameless
alley
lying
at
right
angles
to
the
thames
when
i
pulled
up
sharply
clenching
my
fists
and
listening
a
confused
and
continuous
sound
not
unlike
that
which
might
be
occasioned
by
several
large
and
savage
hounds
at
close
grips
was
proceeding
out
of
the
darkness
ahead
of
me
a
worrying
growling
and
scuffling
which
presently
i
identified
as
human
although
in
fact
it
was
animal
enough
a
moment
i
hesitated
then
distinguishing
among
the
sounds
of
conflict
an
unmistakable
though
subdued
cry
for
help
i
leaped
forward
and
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
the
melee
this
was
taking
place
in
the
lee
of
a
high
dilapidated
brick
wall
a
lamp
in
a
sort
of
iron
bracket
spluttered
dimly
above
on
the
right
but
the
scene
of
the
conflict
lay
in
densest
shadow
so
that
the
figures
were
indistinguishable
help
by
gawd
they
strangling
me
from
almost
at
my
feet
the
cry
arose
and
was
drowned
in
chinese
chattering
but
guided
by
it
i
now
managed
to
make
out
that
the
struggle
in
progress
waged
between
a
burly
english
sailorman
and
two
lithe
chinese
the
yellow
men
seemed
to
have
gained
the
advantage
and
my
course
was
clear
a
straight
right
on
the
jaw
of
the
chinaman
who
was
engaged
in
endeavouring
to
throttle
the
victim
laid
him
prone
in
the
dirty
roadway
his
companion
who
was
holding
the
wrist
of
the
recumbent
man
sprang
upright
as
though
propelled
by
a
spring
i
struck
out
at
him
savagely
he
uttered
a
shrill
scream
not
unlike
that
of
a
stricken
hare
and
fled
so
rapidly
that
he
seemed
to
melt
in
the
mist
gawd
bless
you
mate
came
chokingly
from
the
ground
and
the
rescued
man
extricating
himself
from
beneath
the
body
of
his
stunned
assailant
rose
unsteadily
to
his
feet
and
lurched
toward
me
as
i
had
surmised
he
was
a
sailor
wearing
a
rough
jacket
and
having
his
greasy
trousers
thrust
into
heavy
seaboots
by
which
i
judged
that
he
was
but
newly
come
ashore
he
stooped
and
picked
up
his
cap
it
was
covered
in
mud
as
were
the
rest
of
his
garments
but
he
brushed
it
with
his
sleeve
as
though
it
had
been
but
slightly
soiled
and
clapped
it
on
his
head
he
grasped
my
hand
in
a
grip
of
iron
peering
into
my
face
and
his
breath
was
eloquent
i
had
one
or
two
mate
he
confided
huskily
the
confession
was
unnecessary
it
was
them
two
in
the
blue
anchor
as
did
it
if
i
them
last
two
i
could
broke
up
them
chinks
with
one
tied
behind
that
all
right
i
said
hastily
but
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
this
chink
here
i
added
endeavouring
at
the
same
time
to
extricate
my
hand
from
the
grip
in
which
he
persistently
held
it
he
hit
the
tiles
pretty
heavy
when
he
went
as
if
to
settle
my
doubts
the
recumbent
figure
suddenly
arose
and
without
a
word
fled
into
the
darkness
and
was
gone
like
a
phantom
my
new
friend
made
no
attempt
to
follow
but
you
ca
kill
a
bloody
chink
he
confided
still
clutching
my
hand
it
ai
possible
it
easier
to
kill
a
cat
come
along
o
me
and
one
then
i
tell
you
somethink
i
put
you
on
somethink
i
with
surprising
steadiness
of
gait
considering
the
liquid
cargo
he
had
aboard
the
man
releasing
my
hand
and
now
seizing
me
firmly
by
the
arm
confidently
led
me
by
divers
narrow
ways
which
i
knew
to
a
little
beerhouse
frequented
by
persons
of
his
class
my
own
attire
was
such
as
to
excite
no
suspicion
in
these
surroundings
and
although
i
considered
that
my
acquaintance
had
imbibed
more
than
enough
for
one
night
i
let
him
have
his
own
way
in
order
that
i
might
learn
the
story
which
he
seemed
disposed
to
confide
in
me
settled
in
the
corner
of
the
beerhouse
which
chanced
to
be
nearly
empty
with
portentous
pewters
before
us
the
conversation
was
opened
by
my
new
friend
i
been
paid
off
from
the
jupiter
samuelson
planet
line
he
explained
what
i
am
is
a
she
was
from
singapore
to
london
i
asked
she
was
he
replied
and
it
was
at
suez
it
at
i
did
not
interrupt
him
i
was
ashore
at
suez
we
all
was
owin
to
a
with
the
canal
company
a
matter
of
money
i
may
say
they
make
yer
pay
before
take
yer
through
do
you
know
that
i
nodded
suez
is
a
place
he
continued
where
they
do
sell
whisky
only
poison
was
you
ever
at
suez
again
i
nodded
being
most
anxious
to
avoid
diverting
the
current
of
my
friend
thoughts
well
then
he
continued
you
know
greek
jimmy
and
that
where
i
i
did
not
know
greek
jimmy
but
i
thought
it
unnecessary
to
mention
the
fact
it
was
just
about
this
time
on
a
steamin
night
as
i
come
out
of
jimmy
and
started
for
the
ship
i
was
walkin
along
the
waghorn
quay
same
as
i
might
be
walkin
along
all
by
myself
bit
of
a
list
to
port
but
nothing
much
full
o
joy
an
happiness
free
an
free
just
like
you
might
have
noticed
i
noticed
a
knot
of
chinks
scrappin
on
the
ground
all
amongst
the
dust
right
in
front
of
me
i
rammed
in
windmillin
all
round
and
knocking
down
like
skittles
seemed
to
me
there
was
about
ten
of
but
allowin
for
jimmy
whisky
maybe
there
was
more
than
three
anyway
they
all
shifted
and
left
me
standin
there
in
the
empty
street
with
this
in
my
at
that
without
more
ado
he
thrust
his
hand
deep
into
some
concealed
pocket
and
jerked
out
a
chinese
pigtail
which
had
been
severed
apparently
some
three
inches
from
the
scalp
by
a
clean
cut
my
acquaintance
with
somewhat
bleared
eyes
glistening
in
appreciation
of
his
own
dramatic
skill
for
i
could
not
conceal
my
surprise
dangled
it
before
me
triumphantly
which
of
it
belong
to
he
continued
thrusting
it
into
another
pocket
and
drumming
loudly
on
the
counter
for
more
beer
i
ca
say
i
do
know
but
that
ai
the
tankards
being
refilled
and
my
friend
having
sampled
the
contents
of
his
own
that
ai
all
he
continued
i
thought
i
keep
it
as
a
sort
of
relic
like
what
i
tell
you
amongst
the
crew
three
chinks
see
we
ai
through
the
canal
before
one
of
a
new
one
to
me
li
ping
is
his
name
offers
me
five
bob
for
the
pigtail
which
he
sees
me
looking
at
one
mornin
i
give
him
a
punch
on
the
nose
an
do
renew
the
offer
but
that
night
we
layin
at
port
said
tries
to
pinch
it
i
dam
near
broke
his
neck
and
do
try
any
more
he
extended
his
right
arm
forensically
a
deppitation
of
chinks
waits
on
me
at
the
dock
gates
they
explains
as
from
a
patriotic
point
of
view
they
feels
it
to
be
their
dooty
to
buy
that
pigtail
off
of
me
and
they
bids
a
quid
a
bar
of
gold
a
jimmy
goblin
he
snapped
his
fingers
contemptuously
and
emptied
his
pewter
a
sense
of
what
was
coming
began
to
dawn
on
me
that
the
near
the
riverside
formed
part
of
the
scheme
was
possible
and
reflecting
on
my
rough
treatment
of
the
two
chinamen
i
chuckled
inwardly
possibly
however
the
scheme
had
germinated
in
my
acquaintance
mind
merely
as
a
result
of
an
otherwise
common
assault
of
a
kind
not
unusual
in
these
parts
but
whether
elaborate
or
comparatively
simple
that
the
story
of
the
pigtail
was
a
plant
designed
to
reach
my
pocket
seemed
a
reasonable
hypothesis
i
told
him
to
go
to
china
concluded
the
object
of
my
suspicion
again
rapping
upon
the
counter
and
you
see
what
come
of
it
all
i
got
to
say
is
this
if
they
so
bloody
patriotic
i
says
one
thing
i
ai
the
man
to
stand
in
their
way
you
done
me
a
good
turn
mate
doing
you
one
the
bloody
pigtail
my
empty
mug
fill
the
mug
and
the
pigtail
yours
it
good
for
a
quid
at
the
dock
gates
any
day
my
suspicions
vanished
my
interest
arose
to
boiling
point
i
refilled
my
acquaintance
mug
pressed
a
sovereign
upon
him
in
honesty
i
must
confess
that
he
was
loath
to
take
it
and
departed
with
the
pigtail
coiled
neatly
in
an
inner
pocket
of
my
jacket
i
entered
the
house
in
wade
street
by
the
side
door
and
half
an
hour
later
let
myself
out
by
the
front
door
having
cast
off
my
dockland
disguise
ii
how
i
lost
it
it
was
not
until
the
following
evening
that
i
found
leisure
to
examine
my
strange
acquisition
for
affairs
of
more
immediate
importance
engrossed
my
attention
but
at
about
ten
i
seated
myself
at
my
table
lighted
the
lamp
and
taking
out
the
pigtail
from
the
table
drawer
placed
it
on
the
and
began
to
examine
it
with
the
greatest
curiosity
for
few
chinese
affect
the
pigtail
nowadays
i
had
scarcely
commenced
my
examination
however
when
it
was
dramatically
interrupted
the
door
bell
commenced
to
ring
jerkily
i
stood
up
and
as
i
did
so
the
ringing
ceased
and
in
its
place
came
a
muffled
beating
on
the
door
i
hurried
into
the
passage
as
the
bell
commenced
ringing
again
and
i
had
almost
reached
the
door
when
once
more
the
ringing
ceased
but
now
i
could
hear
a
woman
voice
low
but
agitated
open
the
door
oh
for
god
sake
be
quick
completely
mystified
and
not
a
little
alarmed
i
threw
open
the
door
and
in
there
staggered
a
woman
heavily
veiled
so
that
i
could
see
little
of
her
features
but
by
the
lines
of
her
figure
i
judged
her
to
be
young
uttering
a
sort
of
moan
of
terror
she
herself
closed
the
door
and
stood
with
her
back
to
it
watching
me
through
the
thick
veil
while
her
breast
rose
and
fell
tumultuously
thank
god
there
was
someone
at
home
she
gasped
i
think
i
may
say
with
justice
that
i
had
never
been
so
surprised
in
my
life
every
particular
of
the
incident
marked
it
as
unique
set
it
apart
from
the
episodes
of
everyday
life
madam
i
began
doubtfully
you
seem
to
be
much
alarmed
at
something
and
if
i
can
be
of
any
assistance
to
you
you
have
saved
my
life
she
whispered
and
pressed
one
hand
to
her
bosom
in
a
moment
i
will
wo
you
rest
a
little
after
your
evidently
alarming
experience
i
suggested
my
strange
visitor
nodded
without
speaking
and
i
conducted
her
to
the
study
which
i
had
just
left
and
placed
the
most
comfortable
close
beside
the
table
so
that
as
i
sat
i
might
study
this
woman
who
so
strangely
had
burst
in
upon
me
i
even
tilted
the
shaded
lamp
artlessly
a
trick
i
had
learned
from
harley
in
order
that
the
light
might
fall
upon
her
face
she
may
have
detected
this
device
i
know
not
but
as
if
in
answer
to
its
challenge
she
raised
her
gloved
hands
and
unfastened
the
heavy
veil
which
had
concealed
her
features
thereupon
i
found
myself
looking
into
a
pair
of
lustrous
black
eyes
whose
almond
shape
was
that
of
the
orient
i
found
myself
looking
at
a
woman
who
since
she
was
evidently
a
jewess
was
probably
no
older
than
eighteen
or
nineteen
but
whose
beauty
was
ripely
voluptuous
who
might
fittingly
have
posed
for
salome
who
despite
her
modern
fashionable
garments
at
once
suggested
to
my
mind
the
wanton
beauty
of
the
daughter
of
herodias
i
stared
at
her
silently
for
a
time
and
presently
her
full
lips
parted
in
a
slow
smile
my
ideas
were
diverted
into
another
channel
you
have
yet
to
tell
me
what
alarmed
you
i
said
in
a
low
voice
but
as
courteously
as
possible
and
if
i
can
be
of
any
assistance
in
the
my
visitor
seemed
to
recollect
her
fright
or
the
necessity
for
simulation
the
pupils
of
her
fine
eyes
seemed
to
grow
larger
and
darker
she
pressed
her
white
teeth
into
her
lower
lips
and
resting
her
hands
upon
the
table
leaned
toward
me
i
am
a
stranger
to
london
she
began
now
exhibiting
a
certain
diffidence
and
i
was
looking
for
the
chambers
of
raphael
philips
of
figtree
this
is
figtree
court
i
said
but
i
know
of
no
raphael
philips
who
has
chambers
the
black
eyes
met
mine
despairingly
but
i
am
positive
of
the
address
protested
my
beautiful
but
strange
caller
from
her
left
glove
she
drew
out
a
scrap
of
paper
here
it
i
glanced
at
the
fragment
upon
which
in
a
woman
hand
the
words
were
pencilled
mr
raphael
philips
figtree
court
i
stared
at
my
visitor
deeply
mystified
these
chambers
are
i
said
but
i
am
not
raphael
philips
nor
have
i
ever
heard
of
him
my
name
is
malcolm
knox
there
is
evidently
some
mistake
but
returning
the
slip
of
paper
pardon
me
if
i
remind
you
i
have
yet
to
learn
the
cause
of
your
i
was
followed
across
the
court
and
up
the
followed
by
whom
by
a
man
chattering
in
some
tongue
i
did
not
understand
my
amazement
was
momentarily
growing
greater
what
kind
of
a
man
i
demanded
rather
abruptly
a
man
remember
i
could
only
just
distinguish
him
in
the
darkness
on
the
stairway
and
see
little
more
of
him
than
his
eyes
at
that
and
his
ugly
gleaming
teeth
oh
it
was
horrible
you
astound
me
i
said
the
thing
is
utterly
i
switched
off
the
light
of
the
lamp
i
see
if
there
any
sign
of
him
in
the
court
oh
do
leave
me
for
heaven
sake
do
leave
me
alone
she
clutched
my
arm
in
the
darkness
have
no
fear
i
merely
propose
to
look
out
from
this
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
i
peered
down
into
the
court
below
it
was
quite
deserted
the
night
was
a
very
dark
one
and
there
were
many
patches
of
shadow
in
which
a
man
might
have
lain
concealed
i
can
see
no
one
i
said
speaking
as
confidently
as
possible
and
relighting
the
lamp
if
i
call
a
cab
for
you
and
see
you
safely
into
it
you
will
have
nothing
to
fear
i
i
have
a
cab
waiting
she
replied
and
lowering
the
veil
she
stood
up
to
go
kindly
allow
me
to
see
you
to
it
i
am
sorry
you
have
been
subjected
to
this
annoyance
especially
as
you
have
not
attained
the
object
of
your
thank
you
so
much
for
your
kindness
there
must
be
some
mistake
about
the
address
of
she
clung
to
my
arm
very
tightly
as
we
descended
the
stairs
and
often
glanced
back
over
her
shoulder
affrightedly
as
we
crossed
the
court
there
was
not
a
sign
of
anyone
about
however
and
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
whether
the
story
of
the
yellow
man
was
a
delusion
or
a
fabrication
i
inclined
to
the
latter
theory
but
the
object
of
such
a
deception
was
more
difficult
to
determine
sure
enough
a
taxicab
was
waiting
at
the
entrance
to
the
court
and
my
visitor
having
seated
herself
within
extended
her
hand
to
me
and
even
through
the
thick
veil
i
could
detect
her
brilliant
smile
thank
you
so
much
knox
she
said
and
a
thousand
apologies
i
am
sincerely
sorry
to
have
given
you
all
this
the
cab
drove
off
for
a
moment
i
stood
looking
after
it
in
a
state
of
dreamy
incertitude
then
turned
and
slowly
retraced
my
steps
reopening
the
door
of
my
chambers
with
my
key
i
returned
to
my
study
and
sat
down
at
the
table
to
endeavour
to
arrange
the
facts
of
what
i
recognized
to
be
a
really
amazing
episode
the
adventure
trifling
though
it
seemed
undoubtedly
held
some
hidden
significance
that
at
present
was
not
apparent
to
me
in
accordance
with
the
excellent
custom
of
my
friend
paul
harley
i
prepared
to
make
notes
of
the
occurrence
while
the
facts
were
still
fresh
in
my
memory
at
the
moment
that
i
was
about
to
begin
i
made
an
astounding
discovery
although
i
had
been
absent
only
a
few
minutes
and
had
locked
my
door
behind
me
the
pigtail
was
gone
i
sat
quite
still
listening
intently
the
woman
story
of
the
yellow
man
on
the
stairs
suddenly
assumed
a
totally
different
aspect
a
new
and
sinister
aspect
could
it
be
that
the
pigtail
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
mystery
could
it
be
that
some
murderous
chinaman
who
had
been
lurking
in
hiding
waiting
his
opportunity
had
in
some
way
gained
access
to
my
chambers
during
that
brief
absence
if
so
was
he
gone
from
the
table
drawer
i
took
out
a
revolver
ascertained
that
it
was
fully
loaded
and
turning
up
light
after
light
as
i
proceeded
conducted
a
search
it
was
without
result
there
was
absolutely
nothing
to
indicate
that
anyone
had
surreptitiously
entered
or
departed
from
my
chambers
i
returned
to
the
study
and
sat
gazing
at
the
revolver
lying
on
the
before
me
perhaps
my
mind
worked
slowly
but
i
think
that
fully
fifteen
minutes
must
have
passed
before
it
dawned
on
me
that
the
explanation
not
only
of
the
missing
pigtail
but
of
the
other
incidents
of
the
night
was
simple
enough
the
yellow
man
had
been
a
fabrication
and
my
visitor
had
not
been
in
quest
of
raphael
philips
but
in
quest
of
the
pigtail
and
her
quest
had
been
successful
what
a
hopeless
fool
i
am
i
cried
and
banged
my
fist
down
upon
the
table
there
was
no
yellow
man
at
all
there
was
my
door
bell
rang
i
sprang
nervously
to
my
feet
glanced
at
the
revolver
on
the
table
and
finally
dropped
it
into
my
coat
pocket
ere
going
out
and
opening
the
door
on
the
landing
stood
a
police
constable
and
an
officer
in
plain
clothes
your
name
is
malcolm
knox
asked
the
constable
glancing
at
a
which
he
held
in
his
hand
it
is
i
replied
you
are
required
to
come
at
once
to
bow
street
to
identify
a
woman
who
was
found
murdered
in
a
in
the
strand
about
eleven
i
suppressed
an
exclamation
of
horror
i
felt
myself
turning
pale
but
what
has
it
to
do
the
driver
stated
she
came
from
your
chambers
for
you
saw
her
off
and
her
last
words
to
you
were
night
knox
i
am
sincerely
sorry
to
have
given
you
all
this
trouble
is
that
correct
sir
the
constable
who
had
read
out
the
information
in
an
official
voice
now
looked
at
me
as
i
stood
there
stupefied
it
is
i
said
blankly
i
come
at
it
would
seem
that
i
had
misjudged
my
unfortunate
visitor
her
story
of
the
yellow
man
on
the
stair
had
apparently
been
not
a
fabrication
but
a
gruesome
fact
iii
how
i
regained
it
my
ghastly
duty
was
performed
i
had
identified
the
dreadful
thing
which
less
than
an
hour
before
had
been
a
strikingly
beautiful
woman
as
my
mysterious
visitor
the
police
were
palpably
disappointed
at
the
sparsity
of
my
knowledge
respecting
her
in
fact
had
it
not
chanced
that
detective
sergeant
durham
was
in
the
station
i
think
they
would
have
doubted
the
accuracy
of
my
story
as
a
man
of
some
experience
in
such
matters
i
fully
recognized
its
improbability
but
beyond
relating
the
circumstances
leading
up
to
my
possession
of
the
pigtail
and
the
events
which
had
ensued
i
could
do
no
more
in
the
matter
the
weird
relic
had
not
been
found
on
the
dead
woman
nor
in
the
cab
now
the
unsavoury
business
was
finished
and
i
walked
along
bow
street
racking
my
mind
for
the
to
this
mystery
in
which
i
was
become
enmeshed
how
i
longed
to
rush
off
to
harley
rooms
in
chancery
lane
and
to
tell
him
the
whole
story
but
my
friend
was
a
thousand
miles
away
and
i
had
to
see
the
thing
out
alone
that
the
pigtail
was
some
sacred
relic
stolen
from
a
chinese
temple
and
sought
for
by
its
fanatical
custodians
was
a
theory
which
persistently
intruded
itself
but
i
could
find
no
place
in
that
hypothesis
for
the
beautiful
jewess
and
that
she
was
intimately
concerned
i
did
not
doubt
a
cool
survey
of
the
facts
rendered
it
fairly
evident
that
it
was
she
and
none
other
who
had
stolen
the
pigtail
from
my
rooms
some
third
party
possibly
the
yellow
man
of
whom
she
had
spoken
had
in
turn
stolen
it
from
her
strangling
her
in
the
process
the
police
theory
of
the
murder
and
i
was
prepared
to
accept
it
was
that
the
assassin
had
been
crouching
in
hiding
behind
or
beside
the
cab
or
even
within
the
dark
interior
he
had
leaped
in
and
attacked
the
woman
at
the
moment
that
the
had
started
his
engine
if
already
inside
the
deed
had
proven
even
easier
then
during
some
block
in
the
traffic
he
had
slipped
out
unseen
leaving
the
body
of
the
victim
to
be
discovered
when
the
cab
pulled
up
at
the
hotel
i
knew
of
only
one
place
in
london
where
i
might
hope
to
obtain
useful
information
and
for
that
place
i
was
making
now
it
was
malay
jack
whence
i
had
been
bound
on
the
previous
night
when
my
strange
meeting
with
the
seaman
who
then
possessed
the
pigtail
had
led
to
a
change
of
plan
the
scum
of
the
asiatic
population
always
come
at
one
time
or
another
to
jack
and
i
hoped
by
dint
of
a
little
patience
to
achieve
what
the
police
had
now
apparently
despaired
of
achieving
the
discovery
of
the
assassin
having
called
at
my
chambers
to
obtain
my
revolver
i
mounted
an
the
night
as
i
have
already
stated
was
exceptionally
dark
there
was
no
moon
and
heavy
clouds
were
spread
over
the
sky
so
that
the
deserted
east
end
streets
presented
a
sufficiently
uninviting
aspect
but
one
with
which
i
was
by
no
means
unfamiliar
and
which
certainly
in
no
way
daunted
me
changing
at
paul
harley
chinatown
base
in
wade
street
i
turned
my
steps
in
the
same
direction
as
upon
the
preceding
night
but
if
my
own
will
played
no
part
in
the
matter
then
decidedly
providence
truly
guided
me
poetic
justice
is
rare
enough
in
real
life
yet
i
was
destined
to
witness
swift
retribution
overtaking
a
malefactor
the
which
i
had
trodden
were
utterly
deserted
i
was
far
from
the
lighted
high
road
and
the
only
signs
of
human
activity
that
reached
me
came
from
the
adjacent
river
therefore
when
presently
an
outcry
arose
from
somewhere
on
my
left
for
a
moment
i
really
believed
that
my
imagination
was
vividly
reproducing
the
episode
of
the
night
before
a
furious
scuffle
between
a
european
and
an
asiatic
was
in
progress
not
twenty
yards
away
realizing
that
such
was
indeed
the
case
and
that
i
was
not
the
victim
of
hallucination
i
advanced
slowly
in
the
direction
of
the
sounds
but
my
footsteps
reechoed
hollowly
from
wall
to
wall
of
the
narrow
and
my
coming
brought
the
conflict
to
a
sudden
and
dramatic
termination
thought
i
would
know
yer
ugly
face
did
yer
yelled
a
familiar
voice
no
good
squealin
i
got
yer
i
bust
you
up
if
i
could
a
sound
of
furious
blows
and
inarticulate
chattering
but
it
possible
to
kill
a
chink
i
hurried
forward
toward
the
spot
where
two
dim
figures
were
locked
in
deadly
conflict
take
that
to
remember
me
by
gasped
the
husky
voice
as
i
ran
up
one
of
the
figures
collapsed
in
a
heap
upon
the
ground
the
other
made
off
at
a
lumbering
gait
along
a
second
and
even
narrower
passage
branching
at
right
angles
from
that
in
which
the
scuffle
had
taken
place
the
clatter
of
the
heavy
died
away
in
the
distance
i
stood
beside
the
fallen
man
looking
keenly
about
to
right
and
left
for
an
impression
was
strong
upon
me
that
another
than
i
had
been
witness
of
the
scene
that
a
shadowy
form
had
slunk
back
furtively
at
my
approach
but
the
night
gave
up
no
sound
in
confirmation
of
this
and
i
could
detect
no
sign
of
any
lurker
i
stooped
over
the
chinaman
for
a
chinaman
it
was
who
lay
at
my
feet
and
directed
the
ray
of
my
upon
his
yellow
and
contorted
countenance
i
suppressed
a
cry
of
surprise
and
horror
despite
the
human
impossibility
referred
to
by
the
missing
fireman
this
particular
chinaman
had
joined
the
shades
of
his
ancestors
i
think
that
final
blow
which
had
felled
him
had
brought
his
shaven
skull
in
such
violent
contact
with
the
wall
that
he
had
died
of
the
thundering
concussion
set
up
kneeling
there
and
looking
into
his
upturned
eyes
i
became
aware
that
my
position
was
not
an
enviable
one
particularly
since
i
felt
little
disposed
to
set
the
law
on
the
track
of
the
real
culprit
for
this
man
who
now
lay
dead
at
my
feet
was
doubtless
one
of
the
pair
who
had
attempted
the
life
of
the
fireman
of
the
jupiter
that
my
seafaring
acquaintance
had
designed
to
kill
the
chinaman
i
did
not
believe
despite
his
stormy
words
the
death
had
been
an
accident
and
perhaps
my
morality
was
i
considered
the
assault
to
have
been
justified
now
my
ideas
led
me
further
yet
the
dead
chinaman
wore
a
rough
blue
coat
and
gingerly
for
i
found
the
contact
repulsive
i
inserted
my
hand
into
the
inside
pocket
immediately
my
fingers
closed
upon
a
familiar
object
and
i
stood
up
whistling
slightly
and
dangling
in
my
left
hand
the
missing
pigtail
beyond
doubt
justice
had
guided
the
seaman
blows
this
was
the
man
who
had
murdered
my
visitor
i
stood
perfectly
still
directing
the
little
white
ray
of
my
flashlight
upon
the
pigtail
in
my
hand
i
realized
that
my
position
difficult
before
now
was
become
impossible
the
possession
of
the
pigtail
compromised
me
hopelessly
what
should
i
do
my
god
i
said
aloud
what
does
it
all
mean
it
means
said
a
gruff
voice
that
it
was
lucky
i
was
following
you
and
saw
what
happened
i
whirled
about
my
heart
leaping
wildly
durham
was
standing
watching
me
a
grim
smile
upon
his
face
i
laughed
rather
shakily
lucky
indeed
i
said
thank
god
you
here
this
pigtail
is
a
nightmare
which
threatens
to
drive
me
mad
the
detective
advanced
and
knelt
beside
the
figure
on
the
ground
he
examined
it
briefly
and
then
stood
up
the
fact
that
he
had
the
missing
pigtail
in
his
pocket
he
said
is
proof
enough
to
my
mind
that
he
did
the
and
to
there
another
point
he
added
which
throws
a
lot
of
light
on
the
matter
you
and
harley
were
out
of
town
at
the
time
of
the
huang
chow
case
but
the
chief
and
i
outlined
it
you
remember
one
night
in
harley
rooms
i
remember
it
perfectly
the
giant
spider
in
the
coffin
yes
and
a
certain
ah
fu
confidential
servant
of
the
old
man
who
used
to
buy
the
birds
the
thing
fed
on
well
knox
huang
chow
was
the
biggest
dealer
in
illicit
stuff
in
all
the
east
end
and
this
battered
thing
at
our
feet
is
ah
fu
huang
chow
servant
exactly
i
stared
uncomprehendingly
and
in
what
way
does
this
throw
light
on
the
matter
i
asked
durham
a
very
intelligent
young
officer
smiled
significantly
i
begin
to
see
light
he
declared
the
gentleman
who
made
off
just
as
i
arrived
on
the
scene
probably
had
a
private
quarrel
with
the
chinaman
and
was
otherwise
not
concerned
in
any
i
am
disposed
to
agree
with
you
i
said
guardedly
of
course
you
no
idea
of
his
identity
i
afraid
we
may
find
him
mused
the
officer
glancing
at
me
shrewdly
by
applying
at
the
offices
of
the
planet
line
but
i
rather
doubt
it
also
i
rather
doubt
if
we
look
very
far
he
saved
us
a
lot
of
trouble
but
peering
about
in
the
shadowy
corners
which
abounded
did
i
see
somebody
else
lurking
around
here
i
almost
certain
there
was
someone
else
i
cried
in
fact
i
could
all
but
swear
to
h
said
the
detective
he
not
here
now
might
i
trouble
you
to
walk
along
to
limehouse
police
station
for
the
ambulance
i
better
stay
i
agreed
at
once
and
started
off
thus
a
second
time
my
plans
were
interrupted
for
my
expedition
that
night
ultimately
led
me
to
bow
street
whence
after
certain
formalities
had
been
observed
i
departed
for
my
chambers
the
mysterious
pigtail
in
my
pocket
failing
the
presence
of
durham
the
pigtail
must
have
been
retained
as
evidence
but
we
shall
know
where
to
find
it
if
it
wanted
knox
said
the
yard
man
and
i
can
trust
you
to
look
after
your
own
the
clock
of
paul
was
chiming
the
hour
of
two
when
i
locked
the
door
of
my
chambers
and
prepared
to
turn
in
the
clangour
of
the
final
strokes
yet
vibrated
through
the
night
silence
when
someone
set
my
own
door
bell
loudly
ringing
with
an
exclamation
of
annoyance
i
shot
back
the
bolts
and
threw
open
the
door
a
chinaman
stood
outside
upon
the
mat
iv
how
it
all
ended
me
wishee
see
you
said
the
apparition
smiling
blandly
me
comee
in
come
in
by
all
means
i
said
without
enthusiasm
and
switching
on
the
light
in
my
study
i
admitted
the
chinaman
and
stood
facing
him
with
an
expression
upon
my
face
which
i
doubt
not
was
the
reverse
of
agreeable
my
visitor
who
wore
a
suit
also
wore
a
bowler
hat
now
the
set
bland
smile
still
upon
his
yellow
face
he
removed
the
bowler
and
pointed
significantly
to
his
skull
his
pigtail
had
been
severed
some
three
inches
from
the
root
you
gotchee
my
pigtail
he
explained
me
callee
get
it
thank
thank
you
i
said
grimly
but
i
must
ask
you
to
establish
your
claim
rather
more
yessir
agreed
the
chinaman
and
thereupon
in
tolerable
pidgin
english
he
unfolded
his
tale
he
proclaimed
his
name
to
be
hi
wing
ho
and
his
profession
that
of
a
sailor
or
so
i
understood
him
while
ashore
at
suez
he
had
become
embroiled
with
some
drunken
seamen
knives
had
been
drawn
and
in
the
scuffle
by
some
strange
accident
his
pigtail
had
been
severed
he
had
escaped
from
the
conflict
badly
frightened
and
had
run
a
great
distance
before
he
realized
his
loss
since
southern
chinamen
of
his
particular
tong
hold
their
pigtails
in
the
highest
regard
he
had
instituted
inquiries
as
soon
as
possible
and
had
presently
learned
from
a
chinese
member
of
the
crew
of
the
jupiter
that
the
precious
queue
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
fireman
on
that
vessel
he
hi
wing
ho
had
shipped
on
the
first
available
steamer
bound
for
england
having
in
the
meanwhile
communicated
with
his
friend
on
the
jupiter
respecting
the
recovery
of
the
pigtail
what
was
the
name
of
your
friend
on
the
jupiter
him
li
ping
yessir
without
the
least
hesitation
or
hurry
i
nodded
go
on
i
said
he
arrived
at
the
london
docks
very
shortly
after
the
jupiter
indeed
the
crew
of
the
latter
vessel
had
not
yet
been
paid
off
when
hi
wing
ho
presented
himself
at
the
dock
gates
he
admitted
that
finding
the
fireman
so
obdurate
he
and
his
friend
li
ping
had
resorted
to
violence
but
he
did
not
seem
to
recognize
me
as
the
person
who
had
frustrated
their
designs
thus
far
i
found
his
story
credible
enough
excepting
the
accidental
severing
of
the
pigtail
at
suez
but
now
it
became
wildly
improbable
for
he
would
have
me
believe
that
li
ping
or
ah
fu
obtaining
possession
of
the
pigtail
in
what
manner
hi
wing
ho
protested
that
he
knew
not
he
sought
to
hold
it
to
ransom
knowing
how
highly
hi
wing
ho
valued
it
i
glared
sternly
at
the
chinaman
but
his
impassive
countenance
served
him
well
that
he
was
lying
to
me
i
no
longer
doubted
for
ah
fu
could
not
have
hoped
to
secure
such
a
price
as
would
justify
his
committing
murder
furthermore
the
presence
of
the
unfortunate
jewess
in
the
case
was
not
accounted
for
by
the
ingenious
narrative
of
hi
wing
ho
i
was
standing
staring
at
him
and
wondering
what
course
to
adopt
when
yet
again
my
restless
clamoured
in
the
silence
hi
wing
ho
started
nervously
exhibiting
the
first
symptoms
of
alarm
which
i
had
perceived
in
him
my
mind
was
made
up
in
an
instant
i
took
my
revolver
from
the
drawer
and
covered
him
be
good
enough
to
open
the
door
hi
wing
ho
i
said
coldly
he
shrank
from
me
pouring
forth
voluble
protestations
open
the
door
i
clenched
my
left
fist
and
advanced
upon
him
he
scuttled
away
with
his
odd
chinese
gait
and
threw
open
the
door
standing
before
me
i
saw
my
friend
detective
sergeant
durham
and
with
him
a
remarkably
tall
and
very
man
whose
face
was
deeply
tanned
and
whose
aspect
was
dourly
scottish
when
the
piercing
eyes
of
this
stranger
rested
upon
hi
wing
ho
an
expression
which
i
shall
never
forget
entered
into
them
an
expression
coldly
murderous
as
for
the
chinaman
he
literally
crumpled
up
you
rat
roared
the
stranger
taking
one
long
stride
he
stooped
upon
the
chinaman
seized
him
by
the
back
of
the
neck
as
a
terrier
might
seize
a
rat
and
lifted
him
to
his
feet
the
mystery
of
the
pigtail
knox
said
the
detective
is
solved
at
have
ye
got
it
demanded
the
scotsman
turning
to
me
but
without
releasing
his
hold
upon
the
neck
of
hi
wing
ho
i
took
the
pigtail
from
my
pocket
and
dangled
it
before
his
eyes
suppose
you
come
into
my
study
i
said
and
explain
we
entered
the
room
which
had
been
the
scene
of
so
many
singular
happenings
the
detective
and
i
seated
ourselves
but
the
scotsman
holding
the
chinaman
by
the
neck
as
though
he
had
been
some
inanimate
bundle
stood
just
within
the
doorway
one
of
the
most
gigantic
specimens
of
manhood
i
had
ever
set
eyes
upon
you
do
the
talking
sir
he
directed
the
detective
ye
have
all
the
while
durham
talked
then
we
all
listened
excepting
the
chinaman
who
was
past
taking
an
intelligent
interest
in
anything
and
who
to
judge
from
his
starting
eyes
was
being
slowly
strangled
the
gentleman
said
durham
mr
nicholson
arrived
two
days
ago
from
the
east
he
is
a
buyer
for
a
big
firm
of
diamond
merchants
and
some
weeks
ago
a
valuable
diamond
was
stolen
from
him
by
this
interrupted
the
scotsman
shaking
the
wretched
hi
wing
ho
terrier
fashion
by
hi
wing
ho
explained
the
detective
whom
you
see
before
you
the
theft
was
a
very
ingenious
one
and
the
man
succeeded
in
getting
away
with
his
haul
he
tried
to
dispose
of
the
diamond
to
a
certain
isaac
cohenberg
a
singapore
moneylender
but
isaac
cohenberg
was
the
bigger
crook
of
the
two
hi
wing
ho
only
escaped
from
the
establishment
of
cohenberg
by
dint
of
sandbagging
the
moneylender
and
quitted
the
town
by
a
boat
which
left
the
same
night
on
the
voyage
he
was
indiscreet
enough
to
take
the
diamond
from
its
and
surreptitiously
to
examine
it
another
member
of
the
chinese
crew
one
li
ping
otherwise
ah
fu
the
accredited
agent
of
old
huang
chow
was
secretly
watching
our
friend
and
knowing
that
he
possessed
this
valuable
jewel
he
also
learned
where
he
kept
it
hidden
at
suez
ah
fu
attacked
hi
wing
ho
and
secured
possession
of
the
diamond
it
was
to
secure
possession
of
the
diamond
that
ah
fu
had
gone
out
east
i
do
doubt
it
he
employed
hi
wing
ho
and
hi
wing
ho
tried
to
double
on
him
we
are
indebted
to
you
knox
for
some
of
the
data
upon
which
we
have
reconstructed
the
foregoing
and
also
for
the
next
link
in
the
narrative
a
fireman
ashore
from
the
jupiter
intruded
upon
the
scene
at
suez
and
deprived
ah
fu
of
the
fruits
of
his
labours
hi
wing
ho
seems
to
have
been
badly
damaged
in
the
scuffle
but
ah
fu
the
more
wily
of
the
two
evidently
followed
the
fireman
and
deserting
from
his
own
ship
signed
on
with
the
while
this
story
was
enlightening
in
some
respects
it
was
mystifying
in
others
i
did
not
interrupt
however
for
durham
immediately
resumed
the
drama
was
complicated
by
the
presence
of
a
fourth
character
the
daughter
of
cohenberg
realizing
that
a
small
fortune
had
slipped
through
his
fingers
the
old
moneylender
dispatched
his
daughter
in
pursuit
of
hi
wing
ho
having
learned
upon
which
vessel
the
latter
had
sailed
he
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
this
information
for
he
is
in
touch
with
all
the
crooks
of
the
town
had
he
known
that
the
diamond
had
been
stolen
by
an
agent
of
huang
chow
he
would
no
doubt
have
hesitated
huang
chow
has
an
international
reputation
however
his
daughter
a
girl
of
great
personal
beauty
relied
upon
her
diplomatic
gifts
to
regain
possession
of
the
stone
but
poor
creature
she
had
not
counted
with
ah
fu
who
was
evidently
watching
your
chambers
while
hi
wing
ho
it
seems
was
assiduously
shadowing
ah
fu
how
she
traced
the
diamond
from
point
to
point
of
its
travels
we
do
not
know
and
probably
never
shall
know
but
she
was
undeniably
clever
and
unscrupulous
poor
girl
she
came
to
a
dreadful
end
nicholson
here
identified
her
at
bow
street
now
the
whole
amazing
truth
burst
upon
me
i
understand
i
cried
this
and
i
snatched
up
the
pigtail
that
my
pigtail
moaned
hi
wing
ho
feebly
nicholson
pitched
him
unceremoniously
into
a
corner
of
the
room
and
taking
the
pigtail
in
his
huge
hand
clumsily
unfastened
it
out
from
the
thick
part
some
two
inches
below
the
point
at
which
it
had
been
cut
from
the
chinaman
head
a
great
diamond
dropped
upon
the
floor
for
perhaps
twenty
seconds
there
was
perfect
silence
in
my
study
no
one
stooped
to
pick
the
diamond
from
the
floor
the
diamond
which
now
had
blood
upon
it
no
one
so
far
as
my
sense
informed
me
stirred
but
when
following
those
moments
of
stupefaction
we
all
looked
up
hi
wing
ho
like
a
phantom
had
faded
from
the
room
the
house
of
golden
joss
i
the
idol
stop
when
we
pass
the
next
lamp
and
give
me
a
light
for
my
why
no
do
look
round
warned
my
companion
i
think
someone
is
following
us
and
it
is
always
advisable
to
be
on
guard
in
this
we
had
nearly
reached
the
house
in
wade
street
limehouse
which
my
friend
used
as
a
base
for
east
end
operations
the
night
was
dark
but
clear
and
i
thought
that
presently
when
dawn
came
it
would
bring
a
cold
bright
morning
there
was
no
moon
and
as
we
passed
the
lamp
and
paused
we
stood
in
almost
total
darkness
facing
in
the
direction
of
the
council
school
i
struck
a
match
it
revealed
my
ruffianly
looking
companion
in
whom
his
nearest
friends
must
have
failed
to
recognize
paul
harley
of
chancery
lane
he
was
glancing
furtively
back
along
the
street
and
when
a
moment
later
we
moved
on
i
too
had
detected
the
presence
of
a
figure
stumbling
toward
us
do
stop
at
the
door
whispered
harley
for
our
follower
was
only
a
few
yards
away
accordingly
we
passed
the
house
in
which
harley
had
rooms
and
had
proceeded
some
fifteen
paces
farther
when
the
man
who
was
following
us
stumbled
in
between
harley
and
myself
clutching
an
arm
of
either
i
scarcely
knew
what
to
expect
but
was
prepared
for
anything
when
mates
said
a
man
huskily
mates
if
you
know
where
i
can
get
a
drink
take
me
there
harley
laughed
shortly
i
can
not
say
if
he
remained
suspicious
of
the
newcomer
but
for
my
own
part
i
had
determined
after
one
glance
at
the
man
that
he
was
merely
a
drunken
fireman
newly
recovered
from
a
prolonged
debauch
where
yer
been
old
son
growled
harley
in
that
wonderful
dialect
of
his
which
i
had
so
often
and
so
vainly
sought
to
cultivate
you
look
as
though
you
one
too
many
i
ai
declared
the
fireman
who
appeared
to
be
in
a
condition
i
ai
one
since
ten
last
night
it
dope
wot
got
me
not
dope
said
harley
sharply
been
a
pipe
eh
if
you
got
a
anywhere
continued
the
man
in
that
curious
husky
voice
pity
on
me
mate
i
seen
a
thing
wot
give
me
the
all
right
old
son
said
my
friend
about
turn
got
a
drop
in
the
bottle
but
me
an
my
mate
sails
an
the
gawd
bless
yer
growled
the
fireman
and
the
three
of
us
an
odd
trio
truly
turned
about
retracing
our
steps
as
we
approached
the
street
lamp
and
its
light
shone
upon
the
haggard
face
of
the
man
walking
between
us
harley
stopped
and
wot
up
with
yer
eye
he
inquired
he
suddenly
tilted
the
man
head
upward
and
peered
closely
into
one
of
his
eyes
i
suppressed
a
gasp
of
surprise
for
i
instantly
recognized
the
fireman
of
the
jupiter
nothin
up
with
it
is
there
said
the
fireman
only
a
lump
o
mud
growled
harley
and
with
a
very
dirty
handkerchief
he
pretended
to
remove
the
imaginary
stain
and
then
turning
to
me
open
the
door
jim
he
directed
his
examination
of
the
man
eyes
had
evidently
satisfied
him
that
our
acquaintance
had
really
been
smoking
opium
we
paused
immediately
outside
the
house
for
which
we
had
been
bound
and
as
i
had
the
key
i
opened
the
door
and
the
three
of
us
stepped
into
a
little
dark
room
harley
closed
the
door
and
we
stumbled
upstairs
to
a
low
apartment
facing
the
street
there
was
nothing
in
its
appointments
as
revealed
in
the
light
of
an
oil
lamp
burning
on
the
solitary
table
to
distinguish
it
from
a
thousand
other
such
apartments
which
may
be
leased
for
a
few
shillings
a
week
in
the
neighbourhood
that
adjoining
might
have
told
a
different
story
for
it
more
closely
resembled
an
actor
than
a
seaman
lodging
but
the
door
of
this
sanctum
was
kept
scrupulously
locked
sit
down
old
son
said
my
friend
heartily
pushing
forward
an
old
fetch
out
the
grog
jim
there
about
enough
for
i
walked
to
a
cupboard
as
the
fireman
sank
limply
down
in
the
chair
and
took
out
a
bottle
and
three
glasses
when
the
man
who
as
i
could
now
see
quite
plainly
was
suffering
from
the
after
effects
of
opium
had
eagerly
gulped
the
stiff
drink
which
i
handed
to
him
he
looked
around
with
dim
glazed
eyes
and
you
saved
my
life
mates
he
declared
i
a
nightmare
i
a
nightmare
see
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
me
for
a
moment
then
raised
himself
from
his
seat
peering
narrowly
at
me
across
the
table
i
seed
you
before
mate
gaw
blimey
if
you
ai
the
bloke
wot
i
giv
the
pigtail
to
and
wot
laid
out
that
blasted
chink
as
was
scraggin
me
shake
mate
i
shook
hands
with
him
harley
eyeing
me
closely
the
while
in
a
manner
which
told
me
that
his
quick
brain
had
already
supplied
the
link
connecting
our
doped
acquaintance
with
my
strange
experience
during
his
absence
at
the
same
time
it
occurred
to
me
that
my
fireman
friend
did
not
know
that
ah
fu
was
dead
or
he
would
never
have
broached
the
subject
so
openly
that
so
i
said
and
wondered
if
he
required
further
information
it
all
right
mate
i
do
want
to
no
more
about
blinking
pigtails
not
all
my
life
i
do
and
he
sat
back
heavily
in
his
chair
and
stared
at
harley
where
have
you
been
inquired
harley
as
if
no
interruption
had
occurred
and
then
began
to
reload
his
pipe
at
malay
jack
or
at
number
fourteen
neither
of
cried
the
fireman
some
evidence
of
animation
appearing
in
his
face
i
been
at
kwen
in
pennyfields
that
the
old
bloke
with
the
big
joss

i
harley

was
seated
behind

speaker

at

inquired
facetiously

the
man

empty
mates
i
caught
harley
glance
and
divided
the
remainder
of
the
whisky
evenly
between
the
three
glasses
good
said
the
fireman
and
disposed
of
his
share
at
a
draught
that
bucked
me
up
he
lay
back
in
his
chair
and
from
a
little
began
to
fill
a
short
clay
pipe
look
mates
i
soberin
up
like
after
the
smoke
an
i
can
see
i
can
see
plain
as
nobody
ever
believe
me
nobody
ever
does
worse
luck
but
goes
pass
the
he
lighted
his
pipe
and
looking
about
him
in
a
sort
of
vaguely
aggressive
way
last
night
he
resumed
after
i
was
chucked
out
of
the
dock
gates
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
and
smoke
a
pipe
with
old
ma
lorenzo
round
i
goes
to
pennyfields
and
she
do
seem
glad
to
see
me
there
nobody
there
only
me
not
like
the
old
days
when
you
to
book
your
seat
in
he
laughed
gruffly
she
did
want
to
let
me
in
at
first
said
they
was
watched
that
if
a
chink
an
old
pipe
wot
to
grandfather
it
was
good
enough
to
get
fined
fifty
quid
anyway
me
bein
an
old
friend
she
spread
a
mat
for
me
and
filled
me
a
pipe
i
asked
after
old
kwen
lung
but
of
course
was
out
gamblin
as
usual
so
after
old
ma
lorenzo
made
me
comfortable
an
gone
out
i
the
place
to
myself
and
presently
i
dozed
off
and
forgot
all
about
bloody
ship
bunkers
he
paused
and
looked
about
him
defiantly
i
dunno
long
i
slept
he
continued
but
some
time
in
the
night
i
kind
of
woke
at
that
he
twisted
violently
in
his
chair
and
glared
across
at
harley
you
been
a
pal
to
me
he
said
but
tell
me
i
was
dreamin
again
and
i
smash
yer
bloody
face
he
glared
for
a
while
then
addressing
his
narrative
more
particularly
to
me
he
resumed
it
was
a
scream
wot
woke
me
a
woman
scream
i
did
sit
up
i
could
i
never
felt
like
it
before
it
was
the
same
as
bein
buried
alive
i
should
think
i
could
see
an
i
could
but
i
could
move
one
muscle
in
my
body
foller
me
an
wot

to

murmured
harley
then
you
do
know
much
shouted
the
fireman
i
knew
years
ago
but
kept
stowed
away
somewhere
up
above
an
last
night
was
the
first
time
i
ever
see
it
was
shriek
wot
reached
me
reached
me
through
the
smoke
i
do
take
much
stock
in
chink
gals
in
general
but
this
one
mother
was
no
chink
i
swear
she
was
just
as
pretty
as
a
bloomin
ivory
doll
an
as
little
an
as
white
and
that
old
swine
kwen
lung
tore
the
dress
off
of
shoulders
with
a
bloody
great
whip
harley
was
leaning
forward
in
his
seat
now
intent
upon
the
story
and
although
i
could
not
get
rid
of
the
idea
that
our
friend
was
relating
the
events
of
a
particularly
unpleasant
opium
dream
nevertheless
i
was
fascinated
by
the
strange
story
and
by
the
strange
manner
of
its
telling
i
saw
the
blood
drip
from
bare
shoulders
mates
the
man
continued
huskily
and
with
his
big
dirty
hands
he
strove
to
illustrate
his
words
an
that
old
yellow
devil
lashed
an
lashed
until
the
poor
gal
was
past
screamin
she
just
sunk
down
on
the
floor
all
of
a
moanin
and
moanin
gawd
i
can
moanin
now
meanwhile
me
with
murder
in
me
lyin
there
watchin
an
i
ca
speak
no
i
ca
even
curse
the
yellow
rat
an
i
move
not
a
not
a
foot
just
as
she
fell
there
right
up
against
the
joss
an
blood
trickled
down
on
gilded
feet
old
ma
lorenzo
comes
staggerin
in
i
remember
all
this
as
clear
as
print
mates
remember
it
plain
but
wot
next
ai
so
good
an
clear
somethink
seemed
to
bust
in
me
only
just
before
i
went
off
the
winder
there
only
one
in
the
room
was
smashed
to
smithereens
somebody
come
in
through
are
you
sure
said
harley
eagerly
are
you
sure
that
he
was
intensely
absorbed
in
the
story
he
revealed
by
a
piece
of
bad
artistry
very
rare
in
him
he
temporarily
forgot
his
dialect
our
marine
friend
however
was
too
much
taken
up
with
his
own
story
to
notice
the
slip
and
dead
sure
he
shouted
he
suddenly
twisted
around
in
his
chair
tell
me
i
was
dreamin
mate
he
invited
and
if
you
ai
in
a
tick

old

said
harley
soothingly
get
on
with
your
ho
said
the
fireman
mollified
so
long
as
you
ai
well
then
it
all
blotted
out
after
that
somebody
come
in
at
the
winder
but
it
was
or
wot
it
was
i
ca
tell
yer
not
for
fifty
quid
when
i
woke
up
which
is
about
an
hour
before

roared
the
fireman
and
banged
the
table
lustily
i
see
blood
on
the
joss
an
on
the
floor
where
she
lay
this
morning
i
interjected
this
mornin
in
the
light
of
the
little
oil
lamp
where
old
ma
lorenzo
roasted
the
pills
it
all
still
an
quiet
an
i
feel
more
dead
than

i
goin
to
give
a
hail
see
when
i
sez
to
myself
i
sez
out
to
sea

amongst
kaffirs
bill
it
occurred
to
me
as
old
kwen
lung
might
wonder
much
i
knew
so
i
beat
it
but
when
i
got
in
the
open
air
i
felt
i
never
make
my
without
a
tonic
that
i
come
to
meet
you
mates
listen
i
away
in
the
old
seahawk
in
the
mornin
but
i
tell
you
somethink
that
yellow
bastard
killed
his
daughter
last
night
beat
to
death
i
see
it
plain
the
sweetest
prettiest
bit
of
ivory
as
gawd
ever
put
breath
into
if
body
ai
in
the
river
it
in
the
drunk
or
sober
i
never
could
stand
the
splits
but
mates
he
stood
up
and
grasping
me
by
the
arm
he
drew
me
across
the
room
where
he
also
seized
harley
in
his
muscular
grip
mates
he
went
on
earnestly
she
was
the
sweetest
prettiest
little
gal
as
a
man
ever
clapped
eyes
on
one
of
yer
walk
into
limehouse
station
an
put
the
koppers
wise
sleep
easier
at
sea
if
i
knew
old
kwen
lung
gone
west
on
a
bloody
rope
ii
at
kwen
for
fully
ten
minutes
after
the
fireman
had
departed
paul
harley
sat
staring
abstractedly
in
front
of
him
his
cold
pipe
between
his
teeth
and
knowing
his
moods
i
intruded
no
words
upon
this
reverie
until
come
on
knox
he
said
standing
up
suddenly
i
think
this
matter
calls
for
speedy
what
do
you
think
the
man
story
was
true
i
think
nothing
i
am
going
to
look
at
kwen
lung
without
another
word
he
led
the
way
downstairs
and
out
into
the
deserted
street
the
first
gray
halftones
of
dawn
were
creeping
into
the
sky
so
that
the
outlines
of
limehouse
loomed
like
dim
silhouettes
about
us
there
was
abundant
evidence
in
the
form
of
noises
strange
and
discordant
that
many
workers
were
busy
on
dock
and
riverside
but
the
streets
through
which
our
course
lay
were
almost
empty
sometimes
a
furtive
shadow
would
move
out
of
some
black
gully
and
fade
into
a
dimly
seen
doorway
in
a
manner
peculiarly
unpleasant
and
asiatic
but
we
met
no
palpable
pedestrian
throughout
the
journey
before
the
door
of
a
house
in
pennyfields
which
closely
resembled
that
which
we
had
left
in
wade
street
in
that
it
was
flatly
uninteresting
dirty
and
commonplace
we
paused
there
was
no
sign
of
life
about
the
place
and
no
lights
showed
at
any
of
the
windows
which
appeared
as
dim
cavities
eyeless
sockets
in
the
gray
face
of
the
building
as
dawn
proclaimed
the
birth
of
a
new
day
harley
seized
the
knocker
and
knocked
sharply
there
was
no
response
and
he
repeated
the
summons
but
again
without
effect
thereupon
with
a
muttered
exclamation
he
grasped
the
knocker
a
third
time
and
executed
a
veritable
tattoo
upon
the
door
when
this
had
proceeded
for
about
half
a
minute
or
more
all
right
all
right
came
a
shaky
voice
from
within
i
harley
released
the
knocker
and
turning
to
me
ma
lorenzo
he
whispered
do
make
any
indeed
even
as
he
warned
me
heralded
by
a
creaking
of
bolts
and
the
rattling
of
a
chain
the
door
was
opened
by
a
fat
shapeless
woman
of
indefinite
age
in
whose
dark
eyes
now
sunken
in
bloated
cheeks
in
whose
full
though
drooping
lips
and
even
in
the
whole
overlaid
contour
of
whose
face
and
figure
it
was
possible
to
recognize
the
traces
of
former
beauty
this
was
ma
lorenzo
who
for
many
years
had
lived
at
that
address
with
old
kwen
lung
of
whom
strange
stories
were
told
in
chinatown
as
bill
jones
my
friend
paul
harley
was
well
known
to
ma
lorenzo
as
he
was
well
known
to
many
others
in
that
strange
colony
which
clusters
round
the
london
docks
i
sometimes
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
accompanying
my
friend
on
a
tour
of
investigation
through
the
weird
resorts
which
abound
in
that
neighbourhood
and
indeed
we
had
been
returning
from
one
of
these
baghdad
nights
when
our
present
adventure
had
been
thrust
upon
us
assuming
a
wild
and
boisterous
manner
which
he
had
at
command
up
ma
said
harley
entering
without
ceremony
i
want
to
introduce
my
pal
jim
to
old
kwen
lung
and
make
it
all
right
for
him
before
i
ma
lorenzo
who
was
half
portuguese
replied
in
her
peculiar
accent
this
no
time
to
come
waking
me
up
out
of
bed
but
harley
brushing
past
her
was
already
inside
the
stuffy
little
room
and
i
hastened
to
follow
kwen
lung
shouted
my
friend
loudly
where
are
you
brought
a
friend
to
see
kwen
lung
no
hab
came
the
complaining
tones
of
ma
lorenzo
from
behind
us
it
was
curious
to
note
how
long
association
with
the
chinese
had
resulted
in
her
catching
the
infection
of
that
which
is
a
sort
of
esperanto
in
all
asiatic
quarters
eh
cried
my
friend
pushing
open
a
door
on
the
right
of
the
passage
and
stumbling
down
three
worn
steps
into
a
very
room
where
is
he
go
play
not
come
ma
lorenzo
having
relocked
the
street
door
had
rejoined
us
and
as
i
followed
my
friend
down
into
the
dim
and
uninviting
apartment
she
stood
at
the
top
of
the
steps
hands
on
hips
regarding
us
the
place
which
was
quite
palpably
an
opium
den
must
have
disappointed
anyone
familiar
with
the
more
ornate
houses
of
chinese
vice
in
san
francisco
and
elsewhere
the
bare
floor
was
not
particularly
clean
and
the
few
decorations
which
the
room
boasted
were
garishly
european
for
the
most
part
a
deep
divan
evidently
used
sometimes
as
a
bed
occupied
one
side
of
the
room
and
just
to
the
left
of
the
steps
reposed
the
only
typically
oriental
object
in
the
place
it
was
a
strange
thing
to
see
in
so
sordid
a
setting
a
great
gilded
joss
more
than
squatting
hideous
upon
a
massive
pedestal
a
figure
fit
for
some
native
temple
but
strangely
out
of
place
in
that
dirty
little
limehouse
abode
i
had
never
before
visited
kwen
lung
but
the
fame
of
his
golden
joss
had
reached
me
and
i
know
that
he
had
received
many
offers
for
it
all
of
which
he
had
rejected
it
was
whispered
that
kwen
lung
was
rich
that
he
was
a
great
man
among
the
chinese
and
even
that
some
kind
of
religious
ceremony
periodically
took
place
in
his
house
now
as
i
stood
staring
at
the
famous
idol
i
saw
something
which
made
me
stare
harder
than
ever
the
place
was
lighted
by
a
hanging
lamp
from
which
depended
bits
of
coloured
paper
and
several
gilded
silk
tassels
but
dim
as
the
light
was
it
could
not
conceal
those
stains
there
was
blood
on
the
feet
of
the
golden
idol
all
this
i
detected
at
a
glance
but
ere
i
had
time
to
speak
you
ca
tell
me
that
tale
ma
cried
harley
i
believe
was
smokin
in
when
we
the
woman
shrugged
her
fat
shoulders
no
hab
she
repeated
you
two
johnnies
clear
out
let
me
but
as
i
turned
to
her
beneath
the
nonchalant
manner
i
could
detect
a
great
uneasiness
and
in
her
dark
eyes
there
was
fear
that
harley
also
had
seen
the
bloodstains
i
was
well
aware
and
i
did
not
doubt
that
furthermore
he
had
noted
the
fact
that
the
only
mat
which
the
room
boasted
had
been
placed
before
the
joss
doubtless
to
hide
other
stains
upon
the
boards
as
we
stood
so
i
presently
became
aware
of
a
current
of
air
passing
across
the
room
in
the
direction
of
the
open
door
it
came
from
a
window
before
which
a
tawdry
red
curtain
had
been
draped
either
the
window
behind
the
curtain
was
wide
open
which
is
alien
to
chinese
habits
or
it
was
shattered
while
i
was
wondering
if
harley
intended
to
investigate
further
come
on
jim
he
cried
boisterously
and
clapped
me
on
the
shoulder
the
old
fox
do
want
to
be
he
turned
to
the
woman
tell
him
when
he
wakes
up
ma
he
said
that
if
ever
my
pal
jim
wants
a
pipe
he
to
one
savvy
jim
savvy
replied
the
woman
and
she
was
wholly
unable
to
conceal
her
relief
you
clear
out
now
and
i
tell
kwen
lung
when
he
come
righto
ma
said
harley
kiss
on
both
cheeks
for
me
an
tell
i
be
again
in
a
grasping
me
by
the
arm
he
lurched
up
the
steps
and
the
two
of
us
presently
found
ourselves
out
in
the
street
again
in
the
growing
light
the
squalor
of
the
district
was
more
evident
than
ever
but
the
comparative
freshness
of
the
air
was
welcome
after
the
reek
of
that
room
in
which
the
golden
idol
sat
leering
with
blood
at
his
feet
you
saw
harley
i
exclaimed
excitedly
you
saw
the
stains
and
certain
the
window
was
broken
harley
nodded
shortly
back
to
wade
street
he
said
i
allow
myself
fifteen
minutes
to
shed
bill
jones
able
seaman
and
to
become
paul
harley
of
chancery
as
we
hurried
along
what
steps
shall
you
take
i
asked
first
step
search
kwen
lung
house
from
cellar
to
roof
second
step
entirely
dependent
upon
result
of
first
the
chinese
are
subtle
knox
if
kwen
lung
has
killed
his
daughter
it
may
require
all
the
resources
of
scotland
yard
to
prove
but
there
is
no
about
it
chinatown
is
the
one
district
of
london
which
possesses
the
property
of
swallowing
people
iii
captain
dan
half
an
hour
later
as
i
sat
in
the
inner
room
before
the
great
laboriously
removing
my
disguise
for
i
was
utterly
incapable
of
metamorphosing
myself
like
harley
in
seven
minutes
i
heard
a
rapping
at
the
outer
door
i
glanced
nervously
at
my
face
in
the
mirror
comparatively
little
of
jim
had
yet
been
removed
for
since
time
was
precious
to
my
friend
i
had
acted
as
his
dresser
before
setting
to
work
to
remove
my
own
there
were
two
entrances
to
the
establishment
by
one
of
which
paul
harley
invariably
entered
and
invariably
went
out
and
from
the
other
of
which
bill
jones
was
sometimes
seen
to
emerge
but
never
paul
harley
that
my
friend
had
made
good
his
retirement
i
knew
but
nevertheless
if
i
had
to
open
the
door
of
the
outer
room
it
must
be
as
thinking
it
impolite
not
to
do
so
since
the
one
who
knocked
might
be
aware
that
we
had
come
in
but
not
gone
out
again
i
hastily
readjusted
that
side
of
my
moustache
which
i
had
begun
to
remove
replaced
my
cap
and
muffler
and
carefully
locking
the
door
of
the
crossed
the
outer
apartment
and
opened
the
door
it
was
harley
custom
never
to
enter
or
leave
these
rooms
except
under
the
mantle
of
friendly
night
but
at
so
early
an
hour
i
confess
i
had
not
expected
a
visitor
wondering
whom
i
should
find
there
i
opened
the
door
standing
on
the
landing
was
a
who
permanently
occupied
the
two
top
rooms
of
the
house
paul
harley
had
taken
the
trouble
to
investigate
the
man
past
for
captain
dan
the
name
by
which
he
was
known
in
the
saloons
and
worse
resorts
which
he
frequented
was
palpably
a
gentleman
a
piece
of
flotsam
caught
in
the
yellow
stream
opium
had
been
his
downfall
how
he
lived
i
never
knew
but
harley
believed
he
had
some
small
but
settled
income
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
kill
himself
in
comfort
with
the
black
pills
as
he
stood
there
before
me
in
the
early
morning
light
i
was
aware
of
some
subtle
change
in
his
appearance
it
was
fully
six
months
since
i
had
seen
him
last
but
in
some
vague
way
he
looked
younger
haggard
he
was
with
an
ugly
cut
showing
on
his
temple
but
not
so
lined
as
i
remembered
him
some
former
man
seemed
to
be
struggling
through
the
surface
his
eyes
were
brighter
and
i
noted
with
surprise
that
he
wore
decent
clothes
and
was
clean
shaved
good
morning
jim
he
said
you
remember
me
do
you
as
he
spoke
i
observed
too
that
his
manner
had
altered
he
who
had
consorted
with
the
sweepings
af
the
now
addressed
me
as
a
courteous
gentleman
addresses
an
inferior
not
haughtily
or
patronizingly
but
with
a
note
of
conscious
superiority
and
wholly
unfamiliar
almost
it
threw
me
off
my
guard
but
remembering
in
the
nick
of
time
that
i
was
still
jim
of
course
i
remember
you
i
said
step
thanks
he
replied
and
followed
me
into
the
little
room
i
placed
for
him
the
which
our
friend
the
fireman
had
so
recently
occupied
but
i
wo
sit
down
he
said
and
now
i
observed
that
he
was
evidently
in
a
condition
of
repressed
excitement
perhaps
he
saw
the
curiosity
in
my
glance
for
he
suddenly
rested
both
his
hands
on
my
shoulders
and
yes
i
have
given
up
the
dope
jim
he
said
done
with
it
for
ever
there
not
a
soul
in
this
neighbourhood
i
can
trust
yet
if
ever
a
man
wanted
a
pal
i
want
one
now
you
square
my
lad
i
always
knew
that
in
spite
of
the
dope
and
if
i
ask
you
to
do
a
little
thing
that
means
a
lot
to
me
i
think
you
will
do
it
am
i
right
if
it
can
be
done
i
do
it
said
i
then
listen
i
leaving
england
in
the
patna
for
singapore
she
sails
at
noon
and
passengers
go
on
board
at
ten
i
got
my
ticket
papers
in
order
but
he
paused
impressively
grasping
my
shoulders
hard
i
must
get
on
board
i
stared
him
in
the
face
why
i
asked
he
returned
my
look
with
one
searching
and
eager
then
if
i
show
you
the
reason
said
he
and
trust
you
with
all
my
papers
will
you
go
down
to
the
dock
it
no
great
distance
and
ask
to
see
marryat
the
chief
officer
perhaps
you
sailed
with
him
no
i
replied
guardedly
i
was
never
in
the
never
mind
when
you
give
him
a
letter
which
i
shall
write
he
will
make
the
necessary
arrangements
for
me
to
occupy
my
i
knew
him
well
he
explained
in
the
old
days
will
you
do
it
jim
i
do
it
with
pleasure
i
answered
shake
said
captain
dan
we
shook
hands
heartily
and
now
i
show
you
the
reason
he
added
come
turning
he
led
the
way
upstairs
to
his
own
room
and
wondering
greatly
i
followed
him
in
never
having
been
in
captain
dan
apartments
i
can
not
say
whether
they
like
their
occupant
had
changed
for
the
better
but
i
found
myself
in
a
room
surprisingly
clean
and
with
a
note
of
culture
in
its
appointments
which
was
even
more
surprising
on
a
couch
by
the
window
wrapped
in
a
fur
rug
lay
the
prettiest
girl
i
had
ever
seen
east
or
west
her
skin
was
like
cream
rose
petals
and
her
abundant
hair
was
of
wonderful
lustrous
black
perhaps
it
was
her
smooth
warm
colour
which
suggested
the
idea
but
as
her
cheeks
flushed
at
sight
of
captain
dan
and
the
long
dark
eyes
lighted
up
in
welcome
i
thought
of
a
delicate
painting
on
ivory
and
i
wondered
more
and
more
what
it
all
could
mean
i
have
brought
jim
to
see
you
said
captain
dan
no
do
trouble
to
move
but
even
before
he
had
spoken
i
had
seen
the
girl
wince
with
pain
as
she
had
endeavoured
to
sit
up
to
greet
us
she
lay
on
her
side
in
a
rather
constrained
attitude
but
although
her
sudden
movement
had
brought
tears
to
her
eyes
she
smiled
bravely
and
extended
a
tiny
ivory
hand
to
me
this
is
my
wife
jim
said
captain
dan
i
could
find
no
words
at
all
but
merely
stood
there
looking
very
awkward
and
feeling
almost
awed
by
the
indescribable
expression
of
trust
in
the
eyes
of
the
little
eurasian
as
with
her
tiny
fingers
hidden
in
her
husband
clasp
she
lay
looking
up
at
him
now
you
know
jim
said
he
why
we
must
get
aboard
the
patna
my
wife
is
really
too
ill
to
travel
in
fact
i
shall
have
to
carry
her
down
to
the
cab
and
such
a
proceeding
in
daylight
would
attract
an
enormous
crowd
in
this
neighbourhood
give
me
the
letters
and
the
papers
i
answered
i
will
start
his
wife
disengaged
her
hand
and
extended
it
to
me
thank
you
she
said
in
a
queer
little
voice
you
are
good
i
shall
always
love
iv
the
secret
of
ma
lorenzo
it
must
have
been
about
eleven
that
night
when
paul
harley
rang
me
up
since
we
had
parted
in
the
early
morning
i
had
had
no
word
from
him
and
i
was
all
anxiety
to
tell
him
of
the
quaint
little
romance
which
unknown
to
us
had
had
its
setting
in
the
room
above
in
accordance
with
my
promise
i
had
seen
the
chief
officer
of
the
patna
and
from
the
start
of
surprise
which
he
gave
on
opening
captain
dan
letter
i
judged
that
marryat
and
the
man
who
for
so
long
had
sunk
to
the
lowest
rung
of
the
ladder
had
been
close
friends
in
those
old
at
any
rate
he
had
proceeded
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
without
a
moment
delay
and
the
couple
were
to
go
on
board
the
patna
at
nine
it
was
with
a
sense
of
having
done
at
least
one
good
deed
that
i
finally
quitted
our
limehouse
base
and
returned
to
my
rooms
now
at
eleven
at
night
can
you
come
round
to
chancery
lane
at
once
said
harley
i
want
you
to
run
down
to
pennyfields
with
some
development
in
the
kwen
lung
business
hardly
a
development
but
i
not
satisfied
knox
i
hate
to
be
twenty
minutes
later
i
was
sitting
in
harley
study
watching
him
restlessly
promenading
up
and
down
before
the
fire
the
police
searched
kwen
lung
place
from
foundation
to
tiles
he
said
i
was
there
myself
old
kwen
lung
conveniently
kept
out
of
the
way
still
playing
no
doubt
but
ma
lorenzo
was
in
evidence
she
blandly
declared
that
kwen
lung
never
had
a
daughter
and
in
the
absence
of
our
friend
the
fireman
who
sailed
in
the
seahawk
and
whose
evidence
by
the
way
is
legally
valueless
what
could
we
do
they
could
find
nobody
in
the
neighbourhood
prepared
to
state
that
kwen
lung
had
a
daughter
or
that
kwen
lung
had
no
daughter
there
are
all
sorts
of
fables
about
the
old
fox
but
the
facts
about
him
are
harder
to
get
but
i
explained
the
bloodstains
on
the
joss
ma
lorenzo
stumbled
and
fell
there
on
the
previous
night
striking
her
skull
against
the
foot
of
the
what
nonsense
i
cried
we
should
have
seen
the
wound
last
we
might
have
done
said
harley
musingly
i
do
know
when
she
inflicted
it
on
herself
but
i
did
see
it
this
what
oh
the
gash
is
there
all
right
partly
covered
by
her
he
stood
still
staring
at
me
oddly
one
meets
with
cases
of
singular
devotion
in
unexpected
quarters
sometimes
he
said
you
mean
that
the
woman
inflicted
the
wound
upon
herself
in
order
to
save
old
kwen
lung
exactly
it
good
heavens
i
exclaimed
and
the
window
oh
it
was
broken
right
enough
by
two
drunken
sailormen
fighting
in
the
court
outside
sash
and
everything
smashed
to
he
began
irritably
to
pace
the
carpet
again
it
must
have
been
a
devil
of
a
fight
he
added
savagely
meanwhile
said
i
where
is
old
kwen
lung
hiding
but
more
particularly
cried
harley
where
has
he
hidden
the
poor
victim
come
along
knox
i
going
down
there
for
a
final
look
of
course
the
premises
are
being
watched
of
course
and
also
of
course
i
shall
be
the
laughing
stock
of
scotland
yard
if
nothing
it
was
close
on
midnight
when
once
more
i
found
myself
in
pennyfields
carried
away
by
harley
irritable
excitement
i
had
quite
forgotten
the
romance
of
captain
dan
and
when
having
exchanged
greetings
with
the
detective
on
duty
hard
by
the
house
of
kwen
lung
we
presently
found
ourselves
in
the
presence
of
ma
lorenzo
i
scarcely
knew
for
a
moment
if
i
were
jim
or
my
proper
self
is
kwen
lung
in
asked
harley
sternly
the
woman
shook
her
head
no
she
replied
he
sometimes
stop
away
a
whole
does
he
jerked
harley
come
in
knox
we
take
another
look
a
moment
later
i
found
myself
again
in
the
room
of
the
golden
joss
the
red
curtain
had
been
removed
from
before
the
shattered
window
but
otherwise
the
place
looked
exactly
as
it
had
looked
before
the
atmosphere
was
much
less
stale
however
but
there
was
something
repellent
about
the
great
gilded
idol
smiling
eternally
from
his
pedestal
beside
the
door
i
stared
into
the
leering
face
and
it
was
the
face
of
one
who
knew
and
who
might
have
said
yes
this
and
other
things
equally
strange
have
i
beheld
in
many
lands
as
well
as
england
much
i
could
tell
many
things
grim
and
terrible
and
some
few
joyous
for
behold
i
smile
but
am
for
a
while
harley
stared
abstractedly
at
the
bloodstains
on
the
pedestal
of
the
joss
and
upon
the
floor
beneath
from
which
the
matting
had
been
pulled
back
suddenly
he
turned
to
ma
lorenzo
where
have
you
hidden
the
body
he
demanded
watching
her
i
thought
i
saw
the
woman
flinch
but
there
was
enough
of
the
oriental
in
her
composition
to
save
her
from
she
shook
her
head
slowly
watching
harley
through
eyes
nobody
hab
she
replied
and
i
thought
for
once
that
her
lapse
into
pidgin
had
been
deliberate
and
not
accidental
when
finally
we
quitted
the
house
of
the
missing
kwen
lung
and
when
harley
having
curtly
acknowledged
good
night
from
the
detective
on
duty
we
came
out
into
limehouse
causeway
you
have
not
overlooked
the
possibility
harley
i
said
that
this
woman
explanation
may
be
true
and
that
the
fireman
of
the
seahawk
may
have
been
entertaining
us
with
an
account
of
a
weird
dream
no
snapped
harley
neither
will
scotland
yard
overlook
he
was
in
a
particularly
impossible
mood
for
he
so
rarely
made
mistakes
that
to
be
detected
in
one
invariably
brought
out
those
petulant
traits
of
character
which
may
have
been
due
in
some
measure
to
long
residence
in
the
east
recognizing
that
he
would
rather
be
alone
i
parted
from
him
at
the
corner
of
chancery
lane
and
returned
to
my
own
chambers
furthermore
i
was
very
tired
for
it
was
close
upon
two
and
on
turning
in
i
very
promptly
went
to
sleep
nor
did
i
awaken
until
late
in
the
morning
for
some
odd
reason
but
possibly
because
the
fact
had
occurred
to
me
just
as
i
was
retiring
i
remembered
at
the
moment
of
waking
that
i
had
not
told
harley
about
the
romantic
wedding
of
captain
dan
as
i
had
left
my
friend
in
very
ill
humour
i
thought
that
this
would
be
a
good
excuse
for
an
early
call
and
just
before
eleven
i
walked
into
his
office
innes
his
invaluable
secretary
showed
me
into
the
study
at
the
back
hallo
knox
said
harley
looking
up
from
a
little
silver
buddha
which
he
was
examining
have
you
come
to
ask
for
news
of
the
kwen
lung
case
no
i
replied
is
there
any
harley
shook
his
head
it
seems
like
fate
he
declared
that
this
thing
should
have
been
sent
to
me
this
he
indicated
the
silver
buddha
a
present
from
a
friend
who
knows
my
weakness
for
chinese
ornaments
he
explained
grimly
it
reminds
me
of
that
damned
joss
of
kwen
lung
i
took
up
the
little
image
and
examined
it
with
interest
it
was
most
beautifully
fashioned
in
the
patient
oriental
way
and
there
was
a
little
hinged
door
in
the
back
which
fitted
so
perfectly
that
when
closed
it
was
quite
impossible
to
detect
its
presence
i
glanced
at
harley
i
suppose
you
did
find
a
jewel
inside
i
said
lightly
no
he
replied
there
was
nothing
but
even
as
he
uttered
the
words
his
whole
expression
changed
and
so
suddenly
as
to
startle
me
he
sprang
up
from
the
table
and
have
you
an
hour
to
spare
knox
he
cried
excitedly
i
can
spare
an
hour
but
what
for
for
kwen
lung
four
minutes
later
we
were
speeding
in
the
direction
of
limehouse
and
not
a
word
of
explanation
to
account
for
this
sudden
journey
could
i
extract
from
my
friend
therefore
i
beguiled
the
time
by
telling
him
of
my
adventure
with
captain
dan
harley
listened
to
the
story
in
unbroken
silence
but
at
its
termination
he
brought
his
hand
down
sharply
on
my
knee
i
have
been
almost
perfectly
blind
knox
he
said
but
not
quite
so
perfectly
blind
as
you
i
stared
at
him
in
amazement
but
he
merely
laughed
and
offered
no
explanation
of
his
words
presently
then
i
found
myself
yet
again
in
the
familiar
room
of
the
golden
joss
ma
lorenzo
in
whom
some
hidden
anxiety
seemed
to
have
increased
since
i
had
last
seen
her
stood
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
watching
us
upon
what
idea
my
friend
was
operating
and
what
he
intended
to
do
i
could
not
imagine
but
without
a
word
to
the
woman
he
crossed
the
room
and
grasping
the
great
golden
idol
with
both
arms
he
dragged
it
forward
across
the
floor
as
he
did
so
there
was
a
stifled
shriek
and
ma
lorenzo
stumbling
down
the
steps
threw
herself
on
her
knees
before
harley
raising
imploring
hands
no
no
she
moaned
not
until
i
tell
you
i
tell
you
everything
first
to
begin
with
tell
me
how
to
open
this
thing
he
said
sternly
momentarily
she
hesitated
and
did
not
rise
from
her
knees
but
do
you
hear
me
he
cried
the
woman
rose
unsteadily
and
walking
slowly
round
the
joss
manipulated
some
hidden
fastening
whereupon
the
entire
back
of
the
thing
opened
like
a
door
from
what
was
within
she
shudderingly
averted
her
face
but
harley
stepping
back
against
the
wall
stopped
and
peered
into
the
cavity
good
god
he
muttered
come
and
look
prepared
by
his
manner
for
some
gruesome
spectacle
i
obeyed
and
from
that
which
i
saw
i
recoiled
in
horror
harley
i
whispered
harley
who
is
it
the
spectacle
had
truly
sickened
me
crouched
within
the
narrow
space
enclosed
by
the
figure
of
the
idol
was
the
body
of
an
old
and
wrinkled
chinaman
his
knees
were
drawn
up
to
his
chin
and
his
head
so
compressed
upon
them
that
little
of
his
features
could
be
seen
it
is
kwen
lung
murmured
ma
lorenzo
standing
with
clasped
hands
and
wild
eyes
over
by
the
window
kwen
lung
and
i
am
glad
he
is
dead
such
a
note
of
hatred
came
into
her
voice
as
i
had
never
heard
in
the
voice
of
any
woman
he
is
vile
a
demon
a
mocking
cruel
demon
long
long
years
ago
i
would
have
killed
him
but
always
i
was
afraid
i
tell
you
everything
everything
this
is
how
he
comes
to
be
dead
the
little
one
again
her
voice
changed
and
a
note
of
almost
grotesque
tenderness
came
into
it
the
that
is
his
own
daughter
child
flesh
of
his
flesh
he
keeps
a
prisoner
as
the
women
of
china
are
kept
up
there
she
raised
one
fat
finger
aloft
up
above
he
does
not
know
that
someone
comes
to
see
her
someone
who
used
to
come
to
smoke
but
who
gave
it
up
because
he
had
looked
into
the
dear
one
eye
he
does
not
know
that
she
goes
with
me
to
see
her
man
ah
we
think
he
does
not
know
i
i
arrange
it
all
a
week
ago
they
were
married
tuesday
night
when
kwen
lung
die
i
plan
for
her
to
steal
away
for
ever
for
tears
now
were
running
down
the
woman
fat
cheeks
and
her
voice
quivered
emotionally
for
me
it
is
the
end
but
for
her
it
is
the
beginning
of
life
all
right
i
do
matter
a
damn
she
is
young
and
beautiful
ah
god
so
beautiful
a
drunken
pig
comes
here
and
finds
his
way
in
so
i
give
him
the
smoke
and
presently
he
sleeps
but
it
makes
delay
and
i
do
know
how
soon
kwen
lung
that
yellow
demon
will
wake
for
he
is
like
the
bats
who
sleep
all
day
and
wake
at
night
at
last
the
sailor
pig
sleeps
and
i
call
softly
to
my
dear
little
one
that
the
time
has
come
i
have
gone
out
into
the
street
locking
the
door
behind
me
to
see
if
her
man
is
waiting
and
i
hear
her
shrieks
her
shrieks
i
hurry
back
my
hands
tremble
so
much
that
i
can
scarcely
unlock
the
door
at
last
i
enter
and
i
see
and
i
know
that
yellow
devil
has
learned
all
and
has
been
playing
with
us
like
cat
and
mouse
he
is
lashing
her
with
a
great
whip
lashing
her
that
tiny
sweet
flower
ah
she
choked
in
her
utterance
and
turning
to
the
gilded
joss
which
contained
the
dead
chinaman
she
shook
her
clenched
hands
at
it
and
the
expression
on
her
face
i
can
never
forget
then
as
i
shriek
curses
at
him
crash
goes
the
window
and
i
see
her
husband
spring
into
the
room
the
tender
one
had
fallen
there
at
the
foot
of
the
joss
and
kwen
lung
his
teeth
gleaming
like
a
rat
like
a
devil
turns
to
meet
him
so
he
is
when
her
man
strike
him
once
just
once
she
rested
her
hand
upon
her
heart
and
he
falls
and
he
coughs
he
lie
still
for
him
it
is
finished
that
devil
heart
has
ceased
to
beat
ah
she
threw
up
her
hands
and
that
is
all
i
tell
you
no
one
thing
more
said
harley
sternly
the
name
of
the
man
who
killed
kwen
lung
at
that
ma
lorenzo
slowly
raised
her
head
and
folded
her
arms
across
her
bosom
there
was
something
one
could
never
forget
in
the
expression
of
her
fat
face
not
if
you
burn
me
alive
she
answered
in
a
low
voice
no
one
ever
knows
that
from
she
sank
on
to
the
divan
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
her
fat
shoulders
shook
grotesquely
and
harley
stood
perfectly
still
staring
across
at
her
for
fully
a
minute
i
could
hear
voices
in
the
street
outside
and
the
hum
of
traffic
in
limehouse
causeway
then
my
friend
did
a
singular
thing
walking
over
to
the
gilded
joss
he
reclosed
the
opening
and
not
without
a
great
effort
pushed
the
great
idol
back
against
the
wall
there
are
times
knox
he
said
staring
at
me
oddly
when
i
glad
that
i
am
not
an
official
agent
of
the
while
i
watched
him
dumfounded
he
walked
across
to
the
woman
and
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
she
raised
her
face
all
right
she
whispered
i
am
get
ready
as
soon
as
you
like
said
he
tersely
i
have
the
man
removed
who
is
watching
the
house
and
you
can
reckon
on
hours
to
make
yourself
with
never
another
word
he
seized
me
by
the
arm
and
hurried
me
out
of
the
place
ten
paces
along
the
street
a
fellow
was
standing
leaning
against
a
pillar
harley
stopped
and
even
the
greatest
men
make
mistakes
sometimes
hewitt
he
remarked
i
throwing
up
the
case
probably
inspector
wessex
will
do
the
same
good
on
towards
the
causeway
he
led
me
for
not
a
word
was
i
capable
of
uttering
and
just
before
we
reached
that
artery
of
chinatown
from
came
the
deep
sustained
note
of
a
steamer
siren
the
warning
of
some
big
liner
leaving
dock
that
will
be
the
patna
said
harley
she
sails
at
twelve
i
think
you
said
man
with
the
shaven
skull
i
a
strange
disappearance
pull
that
light
lower
ordered
inspector
wessex
there
you
are
harley
what
do
you
make
of
it
paul
harley
and
i
bent
gingerly
over
the
ghastly
exhibit
to
which
the
official
had
drawn
our
attention
and
to
view
which
we
had
journeyed
from
chancery
lane
to
wapping
this
was
the
body
of
a
man
dressed
solely
in
ragged
shirt
and
trousers
but
the
remarkable
feature
of
his
appearance
lay
in
the
fact
that
every
scrap
of
hair
from
chin
lip
eyebrows
and
skull
had
been
shaved
off
there
was
another
facial
disfigurement
peculiarly
and
horribly
eastern
which
my
pen
may
not
describe
impossible
to
identify
murmured
harley
yes
you
were
right
inspector
this
is
a
victim
of
oriental
deviltry
look
here
too
he
indicated
three
small
wounds
one
situated
on
the
left
shoulder
and
the
others
on
the
forearm
of
the
dead
man
the
divisional
surgeon
can
not
account
for
them
replied
wessex
they
are
quite
superficial
and
he
thinks
they
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
the
body
got
entangled
with
something
in
the
they
are
due
to
the
fact
that
the
man
had
a
birthmark
on
his
shoulder
and
something
probably
a
name
or
some
device
tattooed
on
his
arm
said
harley
quietly
some
few
years
ago
i
met
with
a
similar
case
in
the
neighbourhood
of
stambul
a
woman
he
added
significantly
wessex
listened
to
my
companion
with
respect
for
apart
from
his
established
reputation
as
a
private
which
had
made
his
name
familiar
in
nearly
every
capital
of
the
civilized
world
paul
harley
work
in
constantinople
during
the
six
months
preceding
war
with
turkey
had
merited
higher
reward
than
it
had
ever
received
had
his
recommendations
been
adopted
the
course
of
history
must
have
been
materially
changed
you
think
it
a
chinatown
case
then
harley
possibly
was
the
guarded
answer
paul
harley
nodded
to
the
constable
in
charge
and
the
ghastly
figure
was
promptly
covered
up
again
my
friend
stood
staring
vacantly
at
wessex
and
presently
the
chief
actor
i
think
will
prove
to
be
not
chinese
he
said
turned
and
walked
out
if
there
any
development
remarked
wessex
as
the
three
of
us
entered
harley
car
which
stood
at
the
door
i
will
of
course
report
to
you
harley
but
in
the
absence
of
any
clue
or
mark
of
identification
i
fear
the
verdict
will
be
of
a
man
unknown
which
has
marked
the
finish
of
a
good
many
in
this
cheerful
quarter
of
quite
so
said
harley
absently
it
presents
extraordinary
features
though
and
may
not
end
as
you
suppose
however
where
do
you
want
me
to
drop
you
wessex
at
the
yard
oh
no
answered
wessex
i
made
a
special
visit
to
wapping
just
to
get
your
opinion
on
the
shaven
man
i
really
going
down
to
deepbrow
to
look
into
that
new
disappearance
case
the
daughter
of
the
gamekeeper
you
have
read
of
it
i
have
said
harley
shortly
indeed
readers
of
the
daily
press
were
growing
tired
of
seeing
on
the
contents
bills
another
girl
the
circumstance
which
might
have
been
no
more
than
coincidence
that
three
girls
had
disappeared
within
the
last
eight
weeks
leaving
no
trace
behind
had
stimulated
the
professional
scribes
to
link
the
cases
although
no
visible
link
had
been
found
and
to
enliven
a
somewhat
dull
journalistic
season
with
theories
about
a
new
mormon
the
vanishing
of
this
fourth
girl
had
inspired
them
to
some
startling
headlines
and
the
case
had
interested
me
personally
for
the
reason
that
i
was
acquainted
with
sir
howard
hepwell
one
of
whose
gamekeepers
was
the
stepfather
of
the
missing
molly
clayton
moreover
it
was
hinted
that
she
had
gone
away
in
the
company
of
captain
ronald
vane
at
that
time
a
guest
of
sir
howard
at
the
manor
in
fact
sir
howard
had
to
ask
me
if
i
could
induce
harley
to
run
down
but
my
friend
had
expressed
himself
as
disinterested
in
a
common
case
of
elopement
now
as
wessex
spoke
i
glanced
aside
at
harley
wondering
if
the
fact
that
so
celebrated
a
member
of
the
as
wessex
had
been
put
in
charge
would
induce
him
to
change
his
mind
we
were
traversing
a
particularly
noisy
and
unsavoury
section
of
the
commercial
road
and
although
i
could
see
that
wessex
was
anxious
to
impart
particulars
of
the
case
to
harley
so
loud
was
the
din
that
i
recognized
the
impossibility
of
conversing
and
therefore
have
you
time
to
call
at
my
rooms
wessex
i
asked
well
he
replied
i
have
of
an
you
can
do
it
in
the
car
said
harley
suddenly
i
have
been
asked
to
look
into
this
case
myself
and
before
i
definitely
decline
i
should
like
to
hear
your
version
of
the
accordingly
we
three
presently
gathered
in
my
chambers
and
wessex
with
one
eye
on
the
clock
outlined
the
few
facts
at
that
time
in
his
possession
respecting
the
missing
girl
two
days
before
the
news
of
the
disappearance
had
been
published
broadcast
under
such
headings
as
i
have
already
indicated
a
significant
scene
had
been
enacted
in
the
gamekeeper
cottage
molly
clayton
a
girl
whose
remarkable
beauty
had
made
her
a
central
figure
in
numerous
scandalous
stories
for
such
is
the
charity
of
rural
neighbours
was
detected
by
her
stepfather
about
eight
in
the
evening
slipping
out
of
the
cottage
where
be
ye
goin
hussy
he
demanded
grasping
her
promptly
by
the
arm
for
a
walk
she
replied
defiantly
a
walk
wi
that
fine
soger
from
t
manor
roared
bramber
furiously
you
be
sorry
yet
you
barefaced
gadabout
must
i
tell
you
again
that
t
man
a
villain
the
girl
wrenched
her
arm
from
bramber
grasp
and
blazed
defiance
from
her
beautiful
eyes
he
knows
how
to
respect
a
woman
what
you
do
she
retorted
hotly
so
i
do
respect
you
my
angel
shouted
her
stepfather
then
you
know
what
you
can
do
the
door
open
and
there
few
miss
you
snatching
her
hat
the
girl
very
white
made
to
go
out
whereat
the
gamekeeper
a
brutal
man
with
small
love
for
molly
and
maddened
by
her
taking
him
at
his
word
seized
her
suddenly
by
her
abundant
fair
hair
and
hauled
her
back
into
the
room
a
violent
scene
followed
at
the
end
of
which
molly
fainted
and
bramber
came
out
and
locked
the
door
when
he
came
back
about
nine
the
girl
was
missing
she
did
not
reappear
that
night
and
the
police
were
advised
in
the
morning
their
most
significant
discovery
was
this
captain
ronald
vane
on
the
night
of
molly
disappearance
had
left
the
manor
house
after
dining
alone
with
his
host
sir
howard
hepwell
saying
that
he
proposed
to
take
a
stroll
as
far
as
the
deep
wood
he
never
returned
from
the
moment
that
gamekeeper
bramber
left
his
cottage
and
the
moment
when
sir
howard
hepwell
parted
from
his
guest
after
dinner
the
world
to
which
these
two
people
molly
clayton
and
captain
vane
were
known
knew
them
no
more
i
was
about
to
say
that
they
were
never
seen
again
but
to
me
has
fallen
the
task
of
relating
how
and
where
paul
harley
and
i
met
with
captain
vane
and
molly
clayton
at
the
end
of
the
inspector
account
h
said
harley
glancing
under
his
thick
brows
in
my
direction
could
you
spare
the
time
knox
to
go
to
deepbrow
i
asked
with
interest
yes
we
have
ten
minutes
to
catch
the
i
come
said
i
sir
howard
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
ii
the
clue
of
the
photographs
what
do
you
make
of
it
inspector
asked
my
friend
wessex
smiled
and
scratched
his
chin
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
come
down
he
replied
and
certainly
no
need
for
you
harley
harley
bowed
smiling
at
the
implied
compliment
it
a
common
or
garden
elopement
continued
the
detective
reputation
is
absolutely
rotten
and
the
girl
was
clearly
infatuated
he
must
have
cared
a
good
bit
too
he
be
cashiered
as
sure
as
a
gun
leaving
sir
howard
at
the
manor
we
had
joined
inspector
wessex
at
a
spot
where
the
baronet
preserves
bordered
a
narrow
lane
here
the
ground
was
soft
and
the
detective
drew
harley
attention
to
a
number
of
footprints
by
a
stile
i
got
evidence
that
he
was
seen
here
with
the
girl
on
other
occasions
now
harley
i
ask
you
to
look
over
these
harley
dropped
to
his
knees
and
made
a
brief
but
close
examination
of
the
ground
round
about
one
particularly
clear
imprint
of
a
pointed
toe
he
noticed
especially
and
wessex
diving
into
the
pocket
of
his
light
overcoat
produced
a
shoe
such
as
is
used
for
evening
wear
he
had
a
spare
pair
in
his
bag
he
explained
nonchalantly
and
his
man
did
not
prove
incorruptible
harley
took
the
shoe
and
placed
it
in
the
impression
it
fitted
perfectly
this
is
molly
clayton
i
take
it
he
said
indicating
the
prints
of
a
woman
foot
yes
assented
wessex
you
notice
that
they
stood
for
some
little
time
and
then
walked
off
very
close
harley
nodded
absently
we
lose
them
along
here
continued
wessex
leading
up
the
lane
but
at
the
corner
by
the
big
haystack
they
join
up
with
the
tracks
of
a
i
ask
for
nothing
clearer
there
was
rain
that
afternoon
but
there
been
none
what
does
the
captain
man
think
the
same
as
i
do
he
not
surprised
at
any
madness
on
vane
part
with
a
pretty
woman
in
the
case
the
girl
left
nothing
behind
no
note
traced
the
car
no
it
must
have
been
hired
or
borrowed
from
a
long
distance
where
the
tracks
of
the
tires
were
visible
we
stopped
and
harley
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
marks
seems
to
have
had
a
struggle
with
her
he
said
dryly
very
likely
agreed
wessex
without
interest
harley
crawled
about
on
the
ground
for
some
time
to
the
great
detriment
of
his
harris
tweeds
but
finally
arose
a
curious
expression
on
his
face
which
however
the
detective
evidently
failed
to
observe
we
returned
to
the
manor
house
where
sir
howard
was
awaiting
us
his
red
face
more
red
than
usual
and
in
the
library
with
its
sporting
prints
and
its
works
for
the
most
part
dealing
with
riding
hunting
racing
and
golf
except
for
a
sprinkling
of
nat
gould
novels
and
some
examples
of
the
older
workmanship
of
we
were
presently
comfortably
ensconced
on
a
side
table
were
placed
a
generous
supply
of
liquid
refreshments
cigars
and
cigarettes
so
that
we
made
ourselves
quite
comfortable
and
sir
howard
restrained
his
indignation
until
each
had
a
glass
before
him
and
all
were
smoking
now
he
began
what
have
you
got
to
report
gentlemen
you
inspector
he
pointed
with
his
cigar
toward
wessex
have
seen
man
and
all
of
you
have
been
down
to
look
at
these
damned
tracks
i
only
want
to
hear
one
thing
that
you
expect
to
trace
the
disgraceful
couple
i
see
to
it
his
voice
rose
almost
to
a
shout
that
vane
is
kicked
out
of
the
service
and
as
to
that
shameless
brat
of
bramber
i
wish
her
no
worse
than
the
blackguard
company
one
moment
sir
howard
one
moment
said
harley
quietly
there
are
always
two
sides
to
a
what
do
you
mean
harley
there
only
one
side
that
interests
me
the
outrage
inflicted
upon
my
hospitality
by
this
dirty
guest
of
mine
for
the
girl
i
do
give
twopence
she
was
bound
to
come
to
a
bad
well
said
harley
before
we
pronounce
the
final
verdict
upon
either
of
them
i
should
like
to
interview
bramber
perhaps
he
added
turning
to
wessex
it
would
be
as
well
if
knox
and
i
went
alone
the
presence
of
an
official
detective
sometimes
awes
this
class
of
quite
right
quite
right
agreed
sir
howard
waving
his
cigar
vigorously
go
and
see
bramber
harley
tell
him
that
no
blame
attaches
to
himself
whatever
also
tell
him
with
my
compliments
that
his
stepdaughter
is
quite
so
quite
so
interrupted
harley
endeavouring
to
hide
a
smile
i
understand
your
feelings
sir
howard
but
again
i
ask
you
to
reserve
your
verdict
until
all
the
facts
are
before
as
a
result
harley
and
i
presently
set
out
for
the
cottage
and
as
the
man
had
been
warned
that
we
should
visit
him
he
was
on
the
porch
smoking
his
pipe
a
big
dark
ugly
fellow
he
proved
to
be
of
a
very
forbidding
cast
of
countenance
having
introduced
ourselves
i
always
knowed
she
come
to
a
bad
end
declared
gamekeeper
bramber
almost
echoing
sir
howard
words
one
o
these
gentlemen
o
hers
was
sure
to
be
the
finish
of
her
she
had
other
admirers
before
captain
vane
aye
the
hussy
there
was
a
villain
not
six
months
since
he
got
t
vain
cat
to
go
to
london
an
have
her
photograph
done
in
a
dress
any
decent
woman
would
blushed
to
look
at
like
one
o
these
venuses
up
at
t
manor
good
riddance
she
took
after
her
mother
the
violent
old
ruffian
was
awkward
to
examine
but
harley
persevered
this
previous
admirer
caused
her
to
be
photographed
in
that
way
did
he
have
you
a
copy
no
blazed
bramber
what
i
found
i
burnt
he
ran
off
like
i
told
her
he
would
an
her
cryin
her
eyes
out
but
the
pretty
soger
dried
her
tears
quick
enough
do
you
know
this
man
name
no
a
foreigner
he
where
were
the
photographs
done
in
london
you
say
do
you
know
by
what
photographer
i
do
an
i
do
care
piccadilly
they
had
on
which
was
good
enough
for
have
you
her
picture
no
did
she
receive
a
letter
on
the
day
of
her
disappearance
good
day
said
harley
and
let
me
add
that
the
atmosphere
of
her
home
was
hardly
conducive
to
ideal
conduct
leaving
bramber
to
digest
this
rebuke
we
came
out
of
the
cottage
dusk
was
falling
now
and
by
the
time
that
we
regained
the
manor
the
place
was
lighted
up
inspector
wessex
was
waiting
for
us
in
the
library
and
well
he
said
smiling
slightly
as
we
entered
nothing
much
replied
harley
dryly
except
that
i
do
wonder
at
the
girl
leaving
such
a
what
that
what
roared
a
big
voice
and
sir
howard
came
into
the
room
i
tell
you
bramber
only
had
one
fault
as
a
stepfather
he
enough
a
bad
lot
sir
a
bad
lot
well
sir
said
inspector
wessex
looking
from
one
to
another
personally
beyond
the
usual
inquiries
at
railway
stations
i
can
not
see
that
we
can
do
much
here
do
you
agree
with
me
harley
harley
nodded
quite
he
replied
there
is
a
late
train
to
town
which
i
think
we
could
catch
if
we
started
at
eh
roared
sir
howard
you
not
going
back
your
rooms
are
ready
for
you
damn
it
i
quite
appreciate
the
kindness
sir
howard
replied
harley
but
i
have
urgent
business
to
attend
to
in
london
believe
me
my
departure
is
the
blue
eyes
of
the
baronet
gleamed
with
the
simple
cunning
of
his
kind
you
got
something
up
your
sleeve
he
roared
i
know
you
have
i
know
you
have
inspector
wessex
looked
at
me
significantly
but
i
could
only
shrug
my
shoulders
in
reply
for
in
these
moods
harley
was
as
inscrutable
as
the
sphinx
however
he
had
his
way
and
sir
howard
hurriedly
putting
a
car
in
commission
we
raced
for
the
local
station
and
just
succeeded
in
picking
up
the
express
at
claybury
wessex
was
rather
silent
throughout
the
journey
often
glancing
in
my
friend
direction
but
harley
made
no
further
reference
to
the
case
beyond
outlining
the
interview
with
bramber
until
as
we
were
parting
at
the
london
terminus
wessex
to
report
to
scotland
yard
and
i
to
go
to
harley
rooms
how
long
do
you
think
it
will
take
you
to
find
that
photographer
wessex
he
asked
piccadilly
is
a
sufficient
well
replied
the
inspector
nothing
can
be
done
of
course
but
i
should
think
by
tomorrow
the
matter
should
be
right
said
harley
shortly
may
i
ask
you
to
report
the
result
to
me
wessex
i
will
report
without
iii
ali
of
cairo
it
was
not
until
the
evening
of
the
following
day
that
harley
rang
me
up
and
i
want
you
to
come
round
at
once
he
said
urgently
the
deepbrow
case
is
developing
along
lines
which
i
confess
i
had
anticipated
but
which
are
dramatic
knowing
that
harley
did
not
lightly
make
such
an
assertion
i
put
aside
the
work
upon
which
i
was
engaged
and
hurried
around
to
chancery
lane
i
found
my
friend
pipe
in
mouth
walking
up
and
down
his
study
in
a
state
which
i
knew
to
betoken
suppressed
excitement
and
did
wessex
find
your
photographer
i
asked
on
entering
yes
he
replied
a
man
as
i
had
anticipated
as
i
had
further
anticipated
he
did
a
number
of
copies
of
the
picture
for
the
foreign
gentleman
about
fifty
in
fact
fifty
yes
does
the
significance
of
that
fact
strike
you
asked
harley
a
queer
smile
stealing
across
his
tanned
face
it
is
an
extraordinary
thing
for
even
an
ardent
admirer
to
have
so
many
reproductions
done
of
the
same
picture
it
is
i
will
show
you
now
what
i
found
trodden
into
one
of
the
footprints
where
the
struggle
took
place
beside
the
harley
produced
a
piece
of
thick
silk
twine
what
is
it
it
is
a
link
knox
a
link
to
seek
which
i
really
went
down
to
he
stared
at
me
quizzically
but
my
answering
look
must
have
been
a
blank
one
it
is
part
of
the
tassel
of
one
of
those
red
cloth
caps
commonly
called
in
england
a
fez
he
continued
to
stare
at
me
and
i
to
stare
at
the
piece
of
silk
then
what
is
the
next
move
i
demanded
your
new
clue
rather
bewilders
the
next
move
he
said
is
to
retire
to
the
adjoining
room
and
make
ourselves
look
as
much
like
a
couple
of
oriental
commercial
travellers
as
our
correctly
british
appearance
will
allow
what
i
cried
that
it
laughed
harley
i
have
a
perpetual
tan
and
i
think
i
can
give
you
a
temporary
one
which
i
keep
in
a
bottle
for
the
twenty
minutes
later
then
having
quitted
harley
chambers
by
a
back
way
opening
into
one
of
those
courts
which
abound
in
this
part
of
the
metropolis
two
quietly
attired
eastern
gentlemen
got
into
a
cab
at
the
corner
of
chancery
lane
and
proceeded
in
the
direction
of
limehouse
there
are
haunts
in
many
parts
of
london
whose
very
existence
is
unsuspected
by
all
but
the
few
haunts
unvisited
by
the
tourist
and
even
unknown
to
the
pressman
into
a
quiet
thoroughfare
not
three
minutes
walk
from
the
busy
life
of
west
india
dock
road
harley
led
the
way
before
a
door
sandwiched
in
between
the
entrance
to
a
greek
tobacconist
establishment
and
a
boarded
he
paused
and
turned
to
me
whatever
you
see
or
hear
he
cautioned
express
no
surprise
above
all
show
no
he
rang
the
bell
beside
the
door
and
almost
immediately
it
was
opened
by
a
negress
grossly
and
repellently
ugly
harley
pattered
something
in
what
sounded
like
arabic
whereat
the
negress
displayed
the
utmost
servility
ushering
us
into
an
passage
with
every
evidence
of
respect
following
this
passage
to
its
termination
an
inner
door
was
opened
and
a
burst
of
discordant
music
greeted
us
together
with
a
wave
of
tobacco
smoke
we
entered
despite
my
friend
particular
injunctions
to
the
contrary
i
gave
a
start
of
amazement
we
stood
in
the
doorway
of
a
fairly
large
apartment
having
a
divan
round
three
of
its
sides
this
divan
was
occupied
by
ten
or
a
dozen
men
of
mixed
nationalities
arabs
greeks
lascars
and
others
they
smoked
cigarettes
for
the
most
part
and
sipped
mokha
from
little
cups
a
girl
was
performing
a
wriggling
dance
upon
the
square
carpet
occupying
the
centre
of
the
floor
accompanied
by
a
nubian
boy
who
twanged
upon
a
guitar
and
by
most
of
the
assembled
company
who
clapped
their
hands
to
the
music
or
droned
a
low
tuneless
dirge
shortly
after
our
entrance
the
performance
terminated
and
the
girl
retired
through
a
curtained
doorway
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
our
presence
being
now
observed
suspicious
glances
were
cast
in
our
direction
and
a
very
aged
man
who
sat
smoking
a
narghli
near
the
door
by
which
the
girl
had
made
her
exit
gravely
waved
towards
us
the
amber
mouthpiece
which
he
held
in
his
hand
harley
walked
straight
across
to
him
i
close
at
his
heels
the
light
of
a
lamp
which
hung
close
by
fell
fully
upon
my
friend
face
and
rising
from
his
seat
the
old
man
greeted
him
with
the
dignified
and
graceful
salutation
of
the
east
at
his
request
we
seated
ourselves
beside
him
and
while
we
all
three
smoked
excellent
turkish
cigarettes
harley
and
he
conversed
in
a
low
tone
suddenly
at
some
remark
of
my
friend
our
strange
host
rose
to
his
feet
an
angry
frown
contracting
his
heavy
eyebrows
silence
fell
upon
the
company
in
a
loud
and
peremptory
voice
he
called
out
something
in
arabic
instantly
i
detected
a
fellow
near
the
entrance
door
and
whom
i
had
not
hitherto
observed
slipping
furtively
into
the
shadow
with
a
view
as
i
thought
to
secret
departure
he
seemed
to
be
deformed
in
some
way
and
had
the
most
evil
face
i
had
ever
beheld
in
my
life
angrily
the
majestic
old
man
recalled
him
whereupon
with
a
sort
of
animal
snarl
quite
indescribable
the
fellow
plucked
out
a
knife
two
men
who
had
been
on
the
point
of
seizing
him
fell
back
and
hold
him
shouted
harley
springing
forward
hold
him
it
ali
of
cairo
but
harley
was
too
late
turning
the
strange
and
oriental
ran
like
the
wind
ere
hand
could
be
raised
to
stay
him
he
was
through
the
doorway
that
settles
it
said
harley
grimly
as
once
more
i
found
myself
in
a
cab
beside
him
i
was
right
but
he
forestall
us
who
will
forestall
us
i
asked
in
bewilderment
the
biggest
villain
in
europe
asia
or
africa
cried
my
companion
i
have
wasted
precious
time
i
might
have
he
drummed
irritably
upon
his
knees
the
place
we
have
just
left
is
a
sort
of
club
you
understand
knox
and
hakim
is
the
proprietor
or
host
as
well
as
being
an
old
gentleman
of
importance
and
authority
in
the
moslem
world
i
told
him
of
my
suspicions
which
step
i
should
have
taken
earlier
and
they
were
instantly
confirmed
my
man
was
there
recognized
me
and
bolted
he
forestall
but
my
dear
fellow
i
said
patiently
who
is
this
man
and
what
has
he
to
do
with
the
deepbrow
case
he
is
the
blackest
scoundrel
breathing
answered
harley
bitterly
as
to
what
he
has
to
do
with
the
case
why
did
he
bolt
at
any
rate
i
know
where
to
find
him
now
and
we
may
not
be
too
late
after
but
who
and
what
is
this
man
he
is
ali
of
cairo
as
to
what
he
is
you
will
soon
iv
the
house
by
the
river
on
quitting
the
singular
oriental
club
harley
had
first
raced
off
to
a
public
telephone
where
he
had
spoken
for
some
time
as
i
now
divined
to
scotland
yard
for
when
we
presently
arrived
at
the
headquarters
of
the
metropolitan
police
i
was
surprised
to
find
inspector
wessex
awaiting
us
leaning
out
of
the
cab
window
yes
called
harley
excitedly
was
i
right
you
were
harley
answered
wessex
who
seemed
to
be
no
less
excited
than
my
companion
i
got
the
man
reply
an
hour
i
knew
it
said
harley
shortly
get
in
wessex
we
have
a
minute
to
the
inspector
joined
us
in
the
cab
having
first
given
instructions
to
the
chauffeur
as
we
set
out
once
more
you
have
had
very
little
time
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
continued
my
friend
time
enough
replied
wessex
they
will
not
be
expecting
i
not
so
sure
of
it
one
of
the
biggest
villains
in
the
civilized
world
recognized
me
three
minutes
before
i
called
you
up
and
then
made
good
his
escape
however
there
is
at
least
a
fighting
little
more
was
said
from
that
moment
until
the
end
of
the
drive
both
my
companions
seeming
to
be
consumed
by
an
intense
eagerness
to
reach
our
destination
at
last
the
cab
drew
up
in
a
deserted
street
i
had
rather
lost
my
bearings
but
i
knew
that
we
were
once
more
somewhere
in
the
chinatown
area
and
follow
us
until
we
get
into
the
house
harley
said
to
inspector
wessex
and
wait
out
of
sight
if
you
hear
me
blow
this
whistle
bring
up
the
men
you
have
posted
as
quick
as
you
like
but
make
it
your
particular
business
to
see
that
no
one
gets
out
into
a
yard
we
turned
and
i
felt
a
shudder
of
apprehension
upon
observing
that
it
was
the
entrance
to
a
wharf
dully
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
the
thames
that
grave
of
many
a
ghastly
secret
flowed
beneath
us
emerging
from
the
shadow
of
the
archway
we
paused
before
a
door
in
the
wall
on
our
left
at
that
moment
something
gleamed
through
the
air
whizzed
past
my
ear
and
fell
with
a
metallic
jingle
on
the
stones
instinctively
we
both
looked
up
at
an
unlighted
window
on
the
first
floor
i
caught
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
a
dark
face
you
were
right
i
said
ali
of
cairo
has
forestalled
us
harley
stooped
and
picked
up
a
knife
with
a
broad
and
very
curious
blade
he
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
nonchalantly
all
evidence
he
said
keep
in
the
shadow
and
bend
down
i
am
going
to
stand
on
your
shoulders
and
get
into
that
window
wondering
at
his
daring
i
nevertheless
obeyed
and
harley
succeeded
although
not
without
difficulty
in
achieving
his
purpose
a
moment
after
he
had
disappeared
in
the
blackness
of
the
room
above
stand
clear
knox
i
heard
two
of
the
cushion
seats
sometimes
called
were
thrown
down
and
up
you
come
called
harley
i
grasp
your
hands
if
you
can
it
proved
no
easy
task
but
i
finally
managed
to
scramble
up
beside
my
friend
to
find
myself
in
a
dark
and
stuffy
little
room
this
way
said
harley
rapidly
he
led
the
way
without
more
ado
but
it
was
with
serious
misgivings
that
i
stumbled
up
a
darkened
stair
in
the
rear
of
my
greatly
daring
friend
a
pistol
cracked
in
the
darkness
and
my
fez
was
no
longer
on
my
head
harley
repeater
answered
and
we
stumbled
through
a
heavily
curtained
door
into
a
heated
room
the
air
of
which
was
laden
with
some
eastern
perfume
in
the
dim
light
from
a
lantern
a
figure
showed
momentarily
darting
across
the
place
before
us
again
harley
pistol
spoke
but
as
it
seemed
ineffectively
i
had
little
enough
opportunity
to
survey
my
surroundings
yet
even
in
those
brief
breathless
moments
i
saw
enough
of
the
place
wherein
we
stood
to
make
me
doubt
the
evidence
of
my
senses
outside
i
knew
lay
a
dingy
wharf
amid
a
maze
of
mean
streets
here
was
an
opulently
furnished
apartment
with
a
strong
oriental
note
in
the
decorations
snatching
an
electric
torch
from
his
pocket
harley
leaped
through
a
doorway
draped
with
rich
persian
tapestry
and
i
came
close
on
his
heels
outside
was
darkness
a
strong
draught
met
us
and
passing
along
a
carpeted
corridor
we
never
halted
until
we
came
to
a
room
filled
with
the
weirdest
odds
and
ends
apparently
collected
from
every
quarter
of
the
globe
crack
a
bullet
flattened
itself
on
the
wall
behind
us
good
job
he
ca
shoot
straight
rapped
harley
the
ray
of
the
torch
suddenly
picked
out
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
man
who
was
descending
through
a
trap
in
the
floor
ere
we
had
time
to
shoot
he
was
gone
i
saw
his
brown
fingers
relax
their
hold
and
a
bundle
which
he
had
evidently
hoped
to
take
with
him
was
left
lying
upon
the
floor
together
we
ran
to
the
trap
and
looked
down
slowly
moving
tidal
water
flowed
darkly
beneath
us
for
twenty
breathless
seconds
we
watched
but
nothing
showed
upon
the
surface
i
hope
his
swimming
is
no
better
than
his
shooting
i
said
it
can
avail
him
little
replied
harley
grimly
a
boat
is
waiting
for
anyone
who
tries
to
escape
from
that
side
of
the
house
we
are
by
no
means
alone
in
this
affair
knox
but
firstly
what
have
we
here
he
took
up
the
bundle
which
the
fugitive
had
deserted
something
incriminating
when
ali
of
cairo
dared
not
stay
to
face
it
out
he
would
never
have
deserted
this
place
in
the
ordinary
way
that
fellow
who
was
such
a
bad
shot
was
left
behind
when
the
news
of
our
approach
reached
here
to
make
a
desperate
attempt
to
remove
some
piece
of
evidence
i
swear
to
it
but
we
were
too
soon
for
him
all
the
time
he
was
busily
removing
the
pieces
of
sacking
and
scraps
of
oriental
stuff
with
which
the
bundle
was
fastened
and
finally
he
drew
out
a
together
with
the
linen
collar
shoes
and
underwear
a
complete
outfit
in
fact
and
on
top
of
the
whole
was
a
soft
gray
felt
hat
eagerly
harley
searched
the
garments
for
some
name
of
a
maker
by
which
their
owner
might
be
identified
presently
inside
the
lining
of
the
breast
pocket
where
such
a
mark
is
usually
found
he
discovered
the
label
of
a
west
end
firm
the
police
can
confirm
it
knox
he
said
looking
up
his
face
slightly
flushed
with
triumph
but
i
personally
have
no
doubt
you
may
have
no
doubt
harley
i
retorted
but
i
am
full
of
doubt
what
is
the
significance
of
this
discovery
to
which
you
seem
to
attach
so
much
importance
at
the
moment
replied
my
friend
never
mind
i
still
have
hopes
although
they
have
grown
somewhat
slender
of
making
a
much
more
important
why
not
permit
the
police
to
aid
in
the
search
the
police
are
more
useful
in
their
present
occupation
he
replied
we
are
dealing
with
the
most
cunning
knave
produced
by
east
or
west
and
i
do
mean
to
let
him
slip
through
my
fingers
if
he
is
in
this
house
nevertheless
knox
i
am
submitting
you
to
rather
an
appalling
risk
i
know
for
our
man
is
desperate
and
if
he
is
still
in
the
place
will
prove
as
dangerous
as
a
cornered
but
the
man
who
dropped
through
the
trap
the
man
who
dropped
through
the
trap
said
harley
was
not
ali
of
cairo
and
it
is
ali
of
cairo
for
whom
i
am
looking
the
hunchback
we
saw
harley
nodded
and
having
listened
intently
for
a
few
moments
proceeded
again
to
search
the
singular
apartments
of
the
abode
in
each
was
evidence
of
oriental
occupancy
indeed
some
of
the
rooms
possessed
a
sort
of
arabian
nights
atmosphere
but
no
living
creature
was
to
be
seen
or
heard
anywhere
it
was
while
the
two
of
us
having
examined
every
inch
of
wall
i
should
think
in
the
building
were
standing
staring
rather
blankly
at
each
other
in
the
room
with
the
lighted
lantern
that
i
saw
harley
expression
change
why
he
muttered
is
this
one
room
illuminated
and
all
the
others
in
darkness
even
then
the
significance
of
this
circumstance
was
not
apparent
to
me
but
harley
stared
critically
at
an
electric
switch
which
was
placed
on
the
immediate
right
of
the
door
and
then
up
at
the
lantern
which
lighted
the
room
crossing
he
raised
and
lowered
the
switch
rapidly
but
the
lamp
continued
to
burn
uninterruptedly
ah
he
said
a
good
trick
grasping
the
wooden
block
to
which
the
switch
was
attached
he
turned
it
bodily
and
i
saw
that
it
was
a
masked
knob
for
in
the
next
moment
he
had
pulled
open
the
narrow
section
of
wall
which
proved
to
be
nothing
less
than
a
cunningly
fitted
door
a
small
dimly
lighted
apartment
was
revealed
the
oriental
note
still
predominant
in
its
appointments
which
however
were
few
and
which
i
scarcely
paused
to
note
for
lying
upon
a
mattress
in
this
place
was
a
pretty
girl
she
lay
on
her
side
having
one
white
arm
thrown
out
and
resting
limply
on
the
floor
and
she
seemed
to
be
in
a
condition
for
although
her
fine
eyes
were
widely
opened
they
had
a
glassy
witless
look
and
she
was
evidently
unaware
of
our
presence
look
at
her
pupils
rapped
harley
they
have
drugged
her
with
bhang
poor
pretty
fool
good
god
i
cried
who
is
this
harley
molly
clayton
he
answered
thank
heaven
we
have
saved
one
victim
from
ali
of
v
the
harem
agency
owing
to
the
instrumentality
of
paul
harley
the
public
never
learned
that
the
awful
riverside
murder
called
by
the
press
in
reference
to
the
victim
shaven
skull
the
barber
atrocity
had
any
relation
to
the
deepbrow
case
it
was
physically
impossible
to
identify
the
victim
and
harley
had
his
own
reasons
for
concealing
the
truth
the
house
on
the
wharf
with
its
choice
oriental
furniture
was
seized
by
the
police
but
strange
to
relate
no
arrest
was
made
in
connection
with
this
most
gruesome
outrage
the
man
who
dropped
through
the
trap
had
been
wounded
by
one
of
harley
shots
and
he
sank
for
the
last
time
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
crew
of
the
police
cutter
it
was
at
a
late
hour
on
the
night
of
this
concluding
tragedy
that
i
learned
the
amazing
truth
underlying
the
case
wessex
was
still
at
work
in
the
east
end
upon
the
hundred
and
one
formalities
which
attached
to
his
office
and
harley
and
i
sat
in
the
study
of
my
friend
chambers
in
chancery
lane
you
see
harley
was
explaining
i
got
my
first
clue
down
at
deepbrow
the
tracks
leading
to
the
they
showed
to
anyone
not
hampered
by
a
preconceived
opinion
that
the
girl
and
vane
had
not
gone
on
together
since
the
man
footprints
proved
him
to
have
been
running
but
that
she
had
gone
first
and
that
he
had
run
after
her
arguments
a
he
heard
the
approach
of
the
car
or
b
he
heard
her
call
for
help
in
fact
it
almost
immediately
became
evident
to
me
that
someone
else
had
met
her
at
the
end
of
the
lane
probably
someone
who
expected
her
and
whom
she
was
going
to
meet
when
she
accidentally
encountered
vane
the
captain
was
not
attired
for
an
elopement
and
more
significant
still
he
said
he
should
stroll
to
the
deep
wood
and
that
was
where
he
did
stroll
to
for
it
borders
the
road
at
this
point
i
had
privately
ascertained
from
the
postman
that
molly
clayton
actually
received
a
letter
on
that
morning
this
resolved
my
last
doubt
she
was
not
going
to
meet
vane
on
the
night
of
her
disappearance
then
whom
the
old
love
he
who
some
months
earlier
had
had
over
fifty
seductive
pictures
of
this
undoubtedly
pretty
girl
prepared
for
a
purpose
of
his
own
vane
interfered
when
the
girl
saw
that
they
meant
to
take
her
away
she
no
doubt
made
a
fuss
he
ran
to
the
rescue
they
had
not
reckoned
on
his
being
there
but
these
are
clever
villains
who
leave
no
clues
except
for
one
who
has
met
them
on
their
own
ground
on
their
own
ground
what
do
you
mean
harley
who
are
these
people
well
where
do
you
suppose
those
fifty
photographs
went
i
can
not
conjecture
then
i
will
tell
you
the
turmoil
in
the
east
has
put
wealth
and
power
into
unscrupulous
hands
but
even
before
the
war
there
were
marts
knox
open
marts
at
which
a
negro
girl
might
be
purchased
for
some
pounds
and
a
circassian
for
anything
from
pounds
to
pounds
ah
you
stare
but
i
assure
you
it
was
so
here
is
the
point
though
there
were
and
still
are
private
dealers
those
photographs
were
circulated
among
the
nouveaux
riches
of
the
east
they
were
employed
in
the
same
way
that
any
other
merchant
employs
a
catalogue
they
reached
the
hands
of
many
an
opulent
and
abandoned
of
damascus
stambul
where
you
will
molly
picture
would
be
one
of
many
remember
that
hundreds
of
pretty
girls
disappear
from
their
homes
taking
the
whole
of
the
world
every
year
clearly
english
beauty
is
popular
at
the
moment
and
he
added
bitterly
the
has
escaped
ali
of
cairo
i
cried
then
ali
of
cairo
is
the
biggest
in
the
east
good
god
harley
at
last
i
understand
i
was
slow
enough
to
understand
it
myself
knox
but
once
the
theory
presented
itself
i
asked
wessex
to
get
into
immediate
touch
with
the
valet
he
had
already
interviewed
at
deepbrow
it
was
the
result
of
his
inquiry
to
which
he
referred
when
we
met
him
at
scotland
yard
captain
vane
had
a
large
mole
on
his
shoulder
and
a
girl
name
together
with
a
small
device
tattooed
on
his
forearm
a
freak
of
his
sandhurst
days
then
man
with
the
shaven
skull
is
captain
ronald
vane
may
he
rest
in
peace
but
i
never
shall
until
the
dealer
in
humanity
has
met
his
just
the
white
hat
i
major
jack
ragstaff
hallo
innes
said
paul
harley
as
his
secretary
entered
someone
is
making
a
devil
of
a
row
this
is
the
offender
harley
said
innes
and
handed
my
friend
a
visiting
card
glancing
at
the
card
harley
read
aloud
major
ragstaff
cavalry
meanwhile
a
loud
harsh
voice
which
would
have
been
audible
in
a
full
gale
was
roaring
in
the
lobby
nonsense
i
could
hear
the
major
shouting
balderdash
there
more
fuss
than
if
i
had
asked
for
an
interview
with
the
prime
minister
piffle
balderdash
innes
smile
developed
into
a
laugh
in
which
harley
joined
then
admit
the
major
he
said
into
the
study
where
harley
and
i
had
been
seated
quietly
smoking
there
presently
strode
a
very
choleric
he
wore
a
horsy
check
suit
and
white
spats
and
his
tie
closely
resembled
a
stock
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
heavy
malacca
cane
gloves
and
one
of
those
tall
hats
commonly
termed
white
he
was
below
medium
height
slim
and
wiry
his
gait
and
the
shape
of
his
legs
his
build
all
proclaimed
the
dragoon
his
complexion
was
purple
and
the
large
white
teeth
visible
beneath
a
bristling
gray
moustache
added
to
the
natural
ferocity
of
his
appearance
standing
just
within
the
doorway
mr
paul
harley
he
shouted
it
was
apparently
an
inquiry
but
it
sounded
like
a
reprimand
my
friend
standing
before
the
fireplace
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
nodded
brusquely
i
am
paul
harley
he
said
wo
you
sit
down
major
ragstaff
glancing
angrily
at
innes
as
the
latter
left
the
study
tossed
his
stick
and
gloves
on
to
a
settee
and
drawing
up
a
chair
seated
himself
stiffly
upon
it
as
though
he
were
in
a
saddle
he
stared
straight
at
harley
and
you
are
not
the
sort
of
person
i
expected
sir
he
declared
may
i
ask
if
it
is
your
custom
to
keep
clients
dancin
on
the
mat
and
all
that
on
the
blasted
mat
sir
harley
suppressed
a
smile
and
i
hastily
reached
for
my
which
i
had
placed
upon
the
mantelshelf
i
am
always
naturally
pleased
to
see
clients
major
ragstaff
said
harley
but
a
certain
amount
of
routine
is
necessary
even
in
civilian
life
you
had
not
advised
me
of
your
visit
and
it
is
contrary
to
my
custom
to
discuss
business
after
five
as
harley
spoke
the
major
glared
at
him
continuously
and
then
i
seen
you
in
india
he
roared
damme
i
seen
you
in
india
and
yes
in
turkey
ha
i
got
you
now
sir
he
sprang
to
his
feet
you
the
harley
who
was
in
constantinople
in
quite
then
i
come
to
the
wrong
that
remains
to
be
seen
but
i
was
told
you
were
a
private
detective
and
all
so
i
am
said
harley
quietly
in
the
foreign
office
was
my
client
i
am
now
at
the
service
of
anyone
who
cares
to
employ
hell
said
the
major
he
seemed
to
be
temporarily
stricken
speechless
by
the
discovery
that
a
man
who
had
acted
for
the
british
government
should
be
capable
of
stooping
to
the
work
of
a
private
inquiry
agent
staring
all
about
the
room
with
a
sort
of
naive
wonderment
he
drew
out
a
big
silk
handkerchief
and
loudly
blew
his
nose
all
the
time
eyeing
harley
questioningly
replacing
his
handkerchief
he
directed
his
regard
upon
me
and
this
is
my
friend
knox
said
harley
you
may
state
your
case
before
him
without
hesitation
unless
i
rose
to
depart
but
sit
down
knox
sit
down
sir
shouted
the
major
i
have
no
dirty
linen
to
wash
no
skeletons
in
the
cupboard
or
piffle
of
that
kind
i
simply
want
something
explained
which
i
am
too
too
damned
sir
to
explain
he
resumed
his
seat
and
taking
out
his
wallet
extracted
from
it
a
small
newspaper
cutting
which
he
offered
to
harley
read
that
harley
he
directed
read
it
harley
read
as
follows
before
smith
at
marlborough
street
police
court
john
edward
bampton
was
charged
with
assaulting
a
clubman
in
bond
street
on
wednesday
evening
it
was
proved
by
the
constable
who
made
the
arrest
that
robbery
had
not
been
the
motive
of
the
assault
and
bampton
confessed
that
he
bore
no
grudge
against
the
assailed
man
indeed
that
he
had
never
seen
him
before
he
pleaded
intoxication
and
the
police
surgeon
testified
that
although
not
actually
intoxicated
his
breath
had
smelled
strongly
of
liquor
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
employers
testified
to
a
hitherto
blameless
character
and
as
the
charge
was
not
pressed
the
man
was
dismissed
with
a
having
read
the
paragraph
harley
glanced
at
the
major
with
a
puzzled
expression
the
point
of
this
quite
escapes
me
he
confessed
is
that
so
said
major
ragstaff
is
that
so
sir
perhaps
you
will
be
good
enough
to
read
from
his
wallet
he
took
a
second
newspaper
cutting
smaller
than
the
first
and
gummed
to
a
sheet
of
club
notepaper
harley
took
it
and
read
as
follows
mr
de
lana
a
member
of
the
stock
exchange
who
met
with
a
serious
accident
recently
is
still
in
a
precarious
the
puzzled
look
on
harley
face
grew
more
acute
and
the
major
watched
him
with
an
expression
which
i
can
only
describe
as
one
of
fierce
enjoyment
you
thinkin
i
a
damned
old
fool
ai
you
he
shouted
suddenly
scarcely
that
said
harley
smiling
slightly
but
the
significance
of
these
paragraphs
is
not
apparent
i
must
confess
the
man
bampton
would
not
appear
to
be
an
interesting
character
and
since
no
great
damage
has
been
done
his
drunken
frolic
hardly
comes
within
my
sphere
of
de
lana
of
the
stock
exchange
i
never
heard
unless
he
happens
to
be
a
member
of
the
firm
of
de
lana
and
day
he
not
a
member
of
that
firm
sir
shouted
the
major
he
was
up
to
six
this
what
do
you
mean
exactly
inquired
harley
and
the
tone
of
his
voice
suggested
that
he
was
beginning
to
entertain
doubts
of
the
sanity
or
sobriety
then
he
dead
declared
the
latter
dead
as
the
begum
of
bangalore
he
died
at
six
i
just
spoken
to
his
widow
on
the
i
suppose
i
must
have
been
staring
very
hard
at
the
speaker
and
certainly
harley
was
doing
so
for
suddenly
directing
his
fierce
gaze
toward
me
you
completely
treed
sir
and
so
your
friend
shouted
major
ragstaff
i
confess
it
replied
harley
quietly
and
since
my
time
is
of
some
little
value
i
would
suggest
without
disrespect
that
you
explain
the
connection
if
any
between
yourself
the
drunken
bampton
and
de
lana
of
the
stock
exchange
who
died
you
inform
us
at
six
this
evening
as
the
result
presumably
of
injuries
received
in
an
that
what
i
here
for
cried
major
ragstaff
in
the
first
place
then
i
am
the
party
although
i
saw
to
it
that
my
name
was
kept
out
of
print
whom
the
drunken
lunatic
harley
pipe
in
hand
stared
at
the
speaker
perplexedly
understand
me
continued
the
major
i
am
the
person
i
jack
ragstaff
he
assaulted
i
was
walkin
down
from
my
quarters
in
maddox
street
on
my
way
to
dine
at
the
club
same
as
i
do
every
night
o
my
life
when
this
flamin
idiot
sprang
upon
me
grabbed
my
hat
he
took
up
his
white
hat
to
illustrate
what
had
occurred
not
this
one
but
one
like
it
pitched
it
on
the
ground
and
jumped
on
it
harley
was
quite
unable
to
conceal
his
smiles
as
the
excited
old
soldier
dropped
his
conspicuous
on
the
floor
and
indulged
in
a
vigorous
pantomime
designed
to
illustrate
his
statement
most
extraordinary
said
harley
what
did
you
do
what
did
i
do
roared
the
major
i
gave
him
a
crack
on
the
head
with
my
cane
and
i
said
things
to
him
which
could
be
repeated
in
court
i
punched
him
and
likewise
hoofed
him
but
the
hat
was
completely
done
in
damn
crowd
collected
hearin
me
swearin
and
bellowin
police
and
all
that
names
an
addresses
and
all
that
balderdash
man
lugged
away
to
and
me
turnin
up
at
the
club
with
no
hat
damn
ridiculous
spectacle
at
my
time
of
quite
so
said
harley
soothingly
i
appreciate
your
annoyance
but
i
am
utterly
at
a
loss
to
understand
why
you
have
come
here
and
what
all
this
has
to
do
with
de
lana
of
the
stock
he
fell
out
of
the
window
shouted
the
major
fell
out
of
a
window
out
of
a
window
sir
a
second
floor
window
ten
yards
up
a
side
street
pitched
on
his
skull
marvel
he
was
killed
outright
a
faint
expression
of
interest
began
to
creep
into
harley
glance
and
i
understand
you
to
mean
major
ragstaff
he
said
deliberately
that
while
your
struggle
with
the
drunken
man
was
in
progress
de
lana
fell
out
of
a
neighbouring
window
into
the
street
right
shouted
the
major
right
sir
do
you
know
this
de
lana
never
heard
of
him
in
my
life
until
the
accident
occurred
seems
to
me
the
poor
devil
leaned
out
to
see
the
fun
and
overbalanced
felt
responsible
only
natural
and
made
inquiries
he
died
at
six
this
evenin
h
said
harley
reflectively
i
still
fail
to
see
where
i
come
in
from
what
window
did
he
fall
window
above
a
sort
of
teashop
called
cafe
dame
damn
silly
name
place
on
a
corner
do
know
name
of
side
h
you
do
think
he
was
pushed
out
for
instance
certainly
not
shouted
the
major
he
just
fell
out
but
the
point
is
he
dead
my
dear
sir
said
harley
patiently
i
do
dispute
that
point
but
what
on
earth
do
you
want
of
me
i
do
know
what
i
want
roared
the
major
beginning
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
but
i
know
i
ai
satisfied
not
easy
in
my
mind
sir
i
wake
up
of
a
night
hearin
the
poor
devil
yell
as
he
crashed
on
the
pavement
that
all
wrong
i
heard
hundreds
of
but
he
took
up
his
malacca
cane
and
beat
it
loudly
on
the
table
i
woke
up
of
a
night
dreamin
i
heard
in
a
word
you
suspect
foul
play
i
do
suspect
anything
cried
the
other
excitedly
but
someone
mentioned
your
name
to
me
at
the
club
said
you
could
see
through
concrete
and
all
that
and
here
i
am
there
something
wrong
radically
wrong
find
out
what
it
is
and
send
the
bill
to
me
then
perhaps
i
be
able
to
sleep
in
he
paused
and
again
taking
out
the
large
silk
handkerchief
blew
his
nose
loudly
harley
glanced
at
me
in
rather
an
odd
way
and
then
there
will
be
no
bill
major
ragstaff
he
said
but
if
i
can
see
any
possible
line
of
inquiry
i
will
pursue
it
and
report
the
result
to
ii
a
curious
outrage
what
do
you
make
of
it
harley
i
asked
paul
harley
returned
a
work
of
reference
to
its
shelf
and
stood
staring
absently
across
the
study
our
late
visitor
history
does
not
help
us
much
he
replied
a
somewhat
distinguished
army
career
and
so
forth
and
his
only
daughter
sybil
margaret
married
the
fifth
marquis
of
ireton
she
is
therefore
the
noted
society
beauty
the
marchioness
of
ireton
does
this
suggest
anything
to
your
mind
nothing
whatever
i
said
blankly
nor
to
mine
murmured
harley
the
telephone
bell
rang
hallo
called
harley
yes
that
you
wessex
have
you
got
the
address
good
no
i
shall
remember
it
many
thanks
he
turned
to
me
i
suggest
knox
he
said
that
we
make
our
call
and
then
proceed
to
dinner
as
since
i
was
always
glad
of
an
opportunity
of
studying
my
methods
i
immediately
agreed
and
ere
long
leaving
the
lights
of
the
two
big
hotels
behind
our
cab
was
gliding
down
the
long
slope
which
leads
to
waterloo
station
thence
through
crowded
slummish
we
made
our
way
via
lambeth
to
that
dismal
thoroughfare
westminster
bridge
road
with
its
forbidding
often
windowless
houses
and
its
peculiar
air
of
desolation
the
house
for
which
we
were
bound
was
situated
at
no
great
distance
from
kensington
park
and
telling
the
cabman
to
wait
harley
and
i
walked
up
a
narrow
paved
path
mounted
a
flight
of
steps
and
rang
the
bell
beside
a
somewhat
door
above
which
was
an
fanlight
dimly
illuminated
from
within
a
considerable
interval
elapsed
before
the
door
was
opened
by
a
marvellously
untidy
servant
girl
who
had
apparently
been
interrupted
in
the
act
of
her
face
partly
opening
the
door
she
stared
at
us
agape
pushing
back
wisps
of
hair
from
her
eyes
and
with
every
movement
daubing
more
of
some
mysterious
black
substance
upon
her
countenance
is
bampton
in
asked
harley
yus
just
come
in
i
cookin
his
tell
him
that
two
friends
of
his
have
called
on
rather
important
all
right
said
the
one
what
name
is
it
no
name
just
say
two
friends
of
treating
us
to
a
long
vacant
stare
and
leaving
us
standing
on
the
step
the
maid
in
whose
hand
i
perceived
a
greasy
fork
shuffled
along
the
passage
and
began
to
mount
the
stairs
an
unmistakable
odour
of
frying
sausages
now
reached
my
nostrils
harley
glanced
at
me
quizzically
but
said
nothing
until
the
cinderella
came
stumbling
downstairs
again
without
returning
to
where
we
stood
go
up
she
directed
second
floor
front
shut
the
door
one
of
she
disappeared
into
gloomy
depths
below
as
harley
and
i
closing
the
door
behind
us
proceeded
to
avail
ourselves
of
the
invitation
there
was
very
little
light
on
the
staircase
but
we
managed
to
find
our
way
to
a
poorly
furnished
where
a
small
table
was
spread
for
a
meal
beside
the
table
in
a
a
young
man
was
seated
smoking
a
cigarette
and
having
a
copy
of
the
daily
telegraph
upon
his
knees
he
was
a
very
typical
lower
young
man
but
there
was
a
certain
truculence
indicated
by
his
square
jaw
and
that
sort
of
which
sometimes
accompanies
physical
strength
was
evidenced
in
his
manner
as
tossing
the
paper
aside
he
stood
up
good
evening
bampton
said
harley
genially
i
take
it
pointing
to
the
newspaper
that
you
are
looking
for
a
new
job
bampton
stared
a
suspicion
of
anger
in
his
eyes
then
meeting
the
amused
glance
of
my
friend
he
broke
into
a
smile
very
pleasing
and
humorous
he
was
a
young
fellow
with
hair
inclined
to
redness
and
smiling
he
looked
very
boyish
indeed
i
have
no
idea
who
you
are
he
said
speaking
with
a
faint
accent
but
you
evidently
know
who
i
am
and
what
has
happened
to
got
the
boot
asked
harley
confidentially
bampton
tossing
the
end
of
his
cigarette
into
the
grate
nodded
grimly
you
have
told
me
your
name
he
said
but
i
think
i
can
tell
you
your
he
ceased
smiling
now
look
here
i
do
want
any
more
publicity
if
you
think
you
are
going
to
make
a
funny
newspaper
story
out
of
me
change
your
mind
as
quick
as
you
like
i
never
get
another
job
in
london
as
it
is
if
you
drag
me
any
further
into
the
limelight
i
never
get
another
job
in
my
dear
fellow
replied
harley
soothingly
at
the
same
time
extending
his
you
misapprehend
the
object
of
my
call
i
am
not
a
what
said
bampton
pausing
in
the
act
of
taking
a
cigarette
then
what
the
devil
are
you
my
name
is
paul
harley
and
i
am
a
criminal
he
spoke
the
words
deliberately
having
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
face
but
although
bampton
was
palpably
startled
there
was
no
trace
of
fear
in
his
straightforward
glance
he
took
a
cigarette
from
the
case
and
thanks
harley
he
said
i
can
not
imagine
what
business
has
brought
you
i
have
come
to
ask
you
two
questions
was
the
reply
number
one
who
paid
you
to
smash
major
ragstaff
white
hat
number
two
how
much
did
he
pay
you
to
these
questions
i
listened
in
amazement
and
my
amazement
was
evidently
shared
by
bampton
he
had
been
in
the
act
of
lighting
his
cigarette
but
he
allowed
the
match
to
burn
down
nearly
to
his
fingers
and
then
dropped
it
with
a
muttered
exclamation
in
the
fire
finally
i
do
know
how
you
found
out
he
said
but
you
evidently
know
the
truth
provided
you
assure
me
that
you
are
not
out
to
make
a
newspaper
story
i
tell
you
all
i
harley
laid
his
card
on
the
table
and
unless
the
ends
of
justice
demand
it
he
said
i
give
you
my
word
that
anything
you
care
to
say
will
go
no
further
you
may
speak
freely
before
my
friend
knox
simply
tell
me
in
as
few
words
as
possible
what
led
you
to
court
arrest
in
that
right
replied
bampton
i
he
half
closed
his
eyes
reflectively
i
was
having
tea
in
the
lyons
cafe
to
which
i
always
go
last
monday
afternoon
about
four
when
a
man
sat
down
facing
me
and
got
into
describe
him
he
was
a
man
rather
above
medium
height
i
should
say
about
my
own
build
dark
going
gray
he
had
a
neat
moustache
and
a
short
beard
and
the
look
of
a
man
who
had
travelled
a
lot
his
skin
was
very
tanned
almost
as
deeply
as
yours
harley
not
at
all
the
sort
of
chap
that
goes
in
there
as
a
rule
after
a
while
he
made
an
extraordinary
proposal
at
first
i
thought
he
was
joking
then
when
i
grasped
the
idea
that
he
was
serious
i
concluded
he
was
mad
he
asked
me
how
much
a
year
i
earned
and
i
told
him
peters
and
peters
paid
me
pounds
he
said
give
you
a
year
salary
to
knock
a
man
hat
off
as
bampton
spoke
the
words
he
glanced
at
us
with
twinkling
eyes
but
although
for
my
own
part
i
was
merely
amused
harley
expression
had
grown
very
stern
of
course
i
laughed
continued
bampton
but
when
the
man
drew
out
a
fat
wallet
and
counted
ten
notes
on
the
table
i
began
to
think
seriously
about
his
proposal
even
supposing
he
was
cracked
it
was
absolutely
money
for
nothing
course
he
said
lose
your
job
and
you
may
be
arrested
but
you
say
that
you
had
been
out
with
a
few
friends
and
were
a
little
excited
also
that
you
never
could
stand
white
hats
stick
to
that
story
and
the
balance
of
a
hundred
pounds
will
reach
you
on
the
following
morning
i
asked
him
for
further
particulars
and
i
asked
him
why
he
had
picked
me
for
the
job
he
replied
that
he
had
been
looking
for
some
time
for
the
right
man
a
man
who
was
strong
enough
physically
to
accomplish
the
thing
and
someone
bampton
eyes
twinkled
again
with
a
dash
of
the
devil
in
him
but
at
the
same
time
a
man
who
could
be
relied
upon
to
stick
to
his
guns
and
not
to
give
the
game
away
you
asked
me
to
be
brief
and
i
try
to
be
the
man
in
the
white
hat
was
described
to
me
and
the
exact
time
and
place
of
the
meeting
i
just
had
to
grab
his
white
hat
smash
it
and
face
the
music
i
agreed
i
do
deny
that
i
had
a
couple
of
stiff
drinks
before
i
set
out
but
the
memory
of
that
fifty
pounds
locked
up
here
in
my
room
and
the
further
hundred
promised
bucked
me
up
wonderfully
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
my
man
i
could
see
him
coming
toward
me
as
i
waited
just
outside
a
sort
of
little
restaurant
called
the
cafe
dame
as
arranged
i
bumped
into
him
grabbed
his
hat
and
jumped
on
he
paused
raising
his
hand
to
his
head
reminiscently
my
man
was
a
bit
of
a
scrapper
he
continued
and
he
played
hell
i
never
heard
such
language
in
my
life
and
the
way
he
laid
about
me
with
his
cane
is
something
i
am
not
likely
to
forget
in
a
hurry
a
crowd
gathered
naturally
and
also
naturally
i
was
that
matter
much
i
got
off
lightly
and
although
i
been
dismissed
by
peters
and
peters
twenty
crisp
fivers
are
locked
in
my
trunk
there
with
the
ten
which
i
received
in
the
harley
checked
him
and
may
i
see
the
envelope
in
which
they
arrived
he
asked
sorry
replied
bampton
but
i
burned
it
i
thought
it
was
playing
the
game
to
do
so
it
would
have
helped
you
much
though
he
added
it
was
an
ordinary
common
envelope
posted
in
the
city
address
typewritten
and
not
a
line
registered
bampton
stood
looking
at
us
with
a
curious
expression
on
his
face
and
suddenly
there
one
point
he
said
on
which
my
conscience
is
easy
you
know
about
that
poor
devil
who
fell
out
of
a
window
well
it
would
never
have
happened
if
i
had
kicked
up
a
row
in
the
street
no
doubt
he
was
leaning
out
to
see
what
the
disturbance
was
about
when
the
accident
did
you
actually
see
him
fall
asked
harley
no
he
fell
from
a
window
several
yards
behind
me
in
the
side
street
but
i
heard
him
cry
out
and
as
i
was
lugged
off
by
the
police
i
heard
the
bell
of
the
ambulance
which
came
to
fetch
he
paused
again
and
stood
rubbing
his
head
ruefully
h
said
harley
was
there
anything
particularly
remarkable
about
this
man
in
the
lyons
cafe
bampton
reflected
silently
for
some
moments
and
then
nothing
much
he
confessed
he
was
evidently
a
gentleman
wore
a
blue
a
dark
tweed
suit
and
what
looked
like
a
regimental
tie
but
i
did
see
much
of
the
colours
he
was
very
tanned
as
i
have
said
even
to
the
backs
of
his
hands
and
oh
yes
there
was
one
point
he
had
a
which
tooth
i
ca
remember
except
that
it
was
on
the
left
side
and
i
always
noticed
it
when
he
did
he
wear
any
ring
or
pin
which
you
would
recognize
had
he
any
oddity
of
speech
or
voice
no
just
a
heavy
drawling
manner
he
spoke
like
thousands
of
other
cultured
englishmen
but
wait
a
minute
yes
there
was
one
other
point
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
his
eyes
very
slightly
slanted
harley
stared
like
a
chinaman
oh
nothing
so
marked
as
that
but
the
same
sort
of
harley
nodded
briskly
and
buttoned
up
his
overcoat
thanks
bampton
he
said
we
will
detain
you
no
longer
as
we
descended
the
stairs
where
the
smell
of
frying
sausages
had
given
place
to
that
of
something
burning
probably
the
sausages
i
was
half
inclined
to
think
that
major
ragstaff
ideas
were
traceable
to
a
former
touch
of
the
sun
said
harley
i
begin
to
believe
that
he
has
put
us
on
the
track
of
a
highly
unusual
crime
i
am
sorry
to
delay
dinner
knox
but
i
propose
to
call
at
the
cafe
iii
a
criminal
genius
on
entering
the
doorway
of
the
cafe
dame
we
found
ourselves
in
a
narrow
passage
in
front
of
us
was
a
carpeted
stair
and
to
the
right
a
door
communicating
with
a
discreetly
lighted
little
dining
room
which
seemed
to
be
well
patronized
opening
the
door
harley
beckoned
to
a
waiter
and
i
wish
to
see
the
proprietor
he
said
mr
meyer
is
engaged
at
the
moment
sir
was
the
reply
where
is
he
in
his
office
upstairs
sir
he
will
be
down
in
a
the
waiter
hurried
away
and
harley
stood
glancing
up
the
stairs
as
if
in
doubt
what
to
do
i
can
not
imagine
how
such
a
place
can
pay
he
muttered
the
rent
must
be
enormous
in
this
but
even
before
he
ceased
speaking
i
became
aware
of
an
excited
conversation
which
was
taking
place
in
some
apartment
above
it
scandalous
i
heard
in
a
woman
shrill
voice
you
have
no
right
to
keep
it
it
not
your
property
and
i
here
to
demand
that
you
give
it
a
man
voice
replied
in
voluble
broken
english
but
i
could
only
distinguish
a
word
here
and
there
i
saw
that
harley
was
interested
for
catching
my
questioning
glance
he
raised
his
finger
to
his
lips
enjoining
me
to
be
silent
oh
that
the
game
is
it
continued
the
female
voice
of
course
you
know
it
blackmail
a
flow
of
unintelligible
words
answered
this
speech
then
i
shall
come
back
with
someone
cried
the
invisible
woman
who
will
make
you
give
it
up
knox
whispered
harley
in
my
ear
when
that
woman
comes
down
follow
her
i
afraid
you
will
bungle
the
business
and
i
would
not
ask
you
to
attempt
it
if
big
things
were
not
at
stake
return
here
i
shall
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
sudden
request
had
positively
astounded
me
but
ere
i
had
time
for
any
reply
a
door
suddenly
banged
open
above
and
a
woman
who
might
have
been
some
kind
of
upper
servant
came
quickly
down
the
stairs
an
expression
of
intense
indignation
rested
upon
her
face
and
without
seeming
to
notice
our
presence
she
brushed
past
us
and
went
out
into
the
street
off
you
go
knox
said
harley
seeing
myself
committed
to
an
unpleasant
business
i
slipped
out
of
the
doorway
and
detected
the
woman
five
or
six
yards
away
hurrying
in
the
direction
of
piccadilly
i
had
no
difficulty
in
following
her
for
she
was
evidently
unsuspicious
of
my
presence
and
when
presently
she
mounted
a
i
did
likewise
but
while
she
got
inside
i
went
on
top
and
occupied
a
seat
on
the
near
side
whence
i
could
observe
anyone
leaving
the
vehicle
if
i
had
not
known
paul
harley
so
well
i
should
have
counted
the
whole
business
a
ridiculous
farce
but
recognizing
that
something
underlay
these
seemingly
trivial
and
disconnected
episodes
i
lighted
a
cigarette
and
resigned
myself
to
circumstance
at
hyde
park
corner
i
saw
the
woman
descending
and
when
presently
she
walked
up
hamilton
place
i
was
not
far
behind
her
at
the
door
of
an
imposing
mansion
she
stopped
and
in
response
to
a
ring
of
the
bell
the
door
was
opened
by
a
footman
and
the
woman
hurried
in
evidently
she
was
an
inmate
of
the
establishment
and
conceiving
that
my
duty
was
done
when
i
had
noted
the
number
of
the
house
i
retraced
my
steps
to
the
corner
and
hailing
a
taxicab
returned
to
the
cafe
dame
on
inquiring
of
the
same
waiter
whom
harley
had
accosted
whether
my
friend
was
there
i
think
a
gentleman
is
upstairs
with
meyer
said
the
man
in
his
office
yes
thereupon
i
mounted
the
stairs
and
before
a
door
paused
harley
voice
was
audible
within
and
therefore
i
knocked
and
entered
i
discovered
harley
standing
by
an
american
desk
beside
him
in
a
revolving
chair
which
with
the
desk
constituted
the
principal
furniture
of
a
tiny
office
sat
a
man
in
a
which
had
palpably
not
been
made
for
him
he
had
a
sullen
and
suspiciously
teutonic
cast
of
countenance
and
he
was
engaged
in
a
voluble
but
hardly
intelligible
speech
as
i
entered
ha
knox
said
harley
glancing
over
his
shoulder
did
you
manage
yes
i
replied
harley
nodded
shortly
and
turned
again
to
the
man
in
the
chair
i
am
sorry
to
give
you
so
much
trouble
meyer
he
said
but
i
should
like
my
friend
here
to
see
the
room
at
this
moment
my
attention
was
attracted
by
a
singular
object
which
lay
upon
the
desk
amongst
a
litter
of
bills
and
accounts
this
was
a
piece
of
rusty
iron
bar
somewhat
less
than
three
feet
in
length
and
which
once
had
been
painted
green
you
are
looking
at
this
tragic
fragment
knox
said
harley
taking
up
the
bar
of
course
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
explains
the
whole
unfortunate
occurrence
you
see
there
was
a
flaw
in
the
metal
at
this
end
here
he
indicated
the
spot
and
the
other
end
had
evidently
worn
loose
in
its
but
i
do
it
will
all
be
made
clear
at
the
inquest
no
doubt
a
most
unfortunate
thing
for
you
most
unfortunate
declared
the
proprietor
of
the
restaurant
extending
his
thick
hands
pathetically
most
ruinous
to
my
we
will
go
upstairs
now
said
harley
you
will
kindly
lead
the
way
meyer
and
the
whole
thing
will
be
quite
clear
to
you
as
the
proprietor
walked
out
of
the
office
and
upstairs
to
the
second
floor
harley
whispered
in
my
ear
where
did
she
go
no
hamilton
place
i
replied
in
an
undertone
good
god
muttered
my
friend
and
clutched
my
arm
so
tightly
that
i
winced
good
god
the
master
touch
knox
this
crime
was
the
work
of
a
genius
of
a
genius
with
slightly
very
slightly
oblique
opening
a
door
on
the
second
landing
meyer
admitted
us
to
a
small
its
furniture
consisted
of
a
round
dining
table
several
chairs
a
couch
and
very
little
else
i
observed
however
that
the
furniture
carpet
and
a
few
other
appointments
were
of
a
character
much
more
elegant
than
those
of
the
public
room
below
a
window
which
overlooked
the
street
was
open
so
that
the
plush
curtains
which
had
been
drawn
aside
moved
slightly
to
and
fro
in
the
draught
the
window
of
the
tragedy
knox
explained
harley
he
crossed
the
room
if
you
will
stand
here
beside
me
you
will
see
the
gap
in
the
railing
caused
by
the
breaking
away
of
the
fragment
which
now
lies
on
meyer
desk
some
few
yards
to
the
left
in
the
street
below
is
where
the
assault
took
place
of
which
we
have
heard
and
the
unfortunate
de
lana
who
was
dining
here
alone
an
eccentric
custom
of
his
naturally
ran
to
the
window
upon
hearing
the
disturbance
and
leaned
out
supporting
his
weight
upon
the
railing
the
rail
collapsed
and
we
know
the
it
will
ruin
me
groaned
meyer
it
will
give
bad
repute
to
my
i
fear
it
will
agreed
harley
sympathetically
unless
we
can
manage
to
clear
up
one
or
two
little
difficulties
which
i
have
observed
for
instance
he
tapped
the
proprietor
on
the
shoulder
confidentially
have
you
any
idea
any
hazy
idea
of
the
identity
of
the
woman
who
was
dining
here
with
de
lana
on
wednesday
night
the
effect
of
this
simple
inquiry
upon
the
proprietor
was
phenomenal
his
fat
yellow
face
assumed
a
sort
of
leaden
hue
and
his
already
prominent
eyes
protruded
abnormally
he
licked
his
lips
i
tell
you
already
i
tell
you
he
muttered
that
de
lana
he
engage
this
room
every
wednesday
and
sometimes
also
friday
and
dine
here
by
and
i
tell
you
said
harley
sweetly
that
you
are
an
inspired
liar
you
smuggled
her
out
by
the
side
entrance
after
the
the
side
entrance
muttered
meyer
the
side
entrance
exactly
the
side
entrance
there
is
something
else
which
i
must
ask
you
to
tell
me
who
had
engaged
this
room
on
tuesday
night
the
night
before
the
accident
the
proprietor
expression
remained
uncomprehending
and
a
gentleman
he
said
i
never
see
him
another
solitary
diner
suggested
harley
yes
he
is
alone
all
the
evening
waiting
for
a
friend
who
does
not
ah
mused
harley
alone
all
the
evening
was
he
and
his
friend
disappointed
him
may
i
suggest
that
he
was
a
dark
man
gray
at
the
temples
having
a
dark
beard
and
moustache
and
a
very
tanned
face
his
eyes
slanted
slightly
upward
yes
yes
cried
meyer
and
his
astonishment
was
patently
unfeigned
it
is
a
friend
of
yours
a
friend
of
mine
yes
said
harley
absently
but
his
expression
was
very
grim
what
time
did
he
finally
leave
he
waited
until
after
eleven
the
dinner
is
spoilt
he
pays
but
does
not
no
said
harley
musingly
he
had
nothing
to
complain
about
one
more
question
my
friend
when
the
lady
escaped
hurriedly
on
wednesday
night
what
was
it
that
she
left
behind
and
what
price
are
you
trying
to
extort
from
her
for
returning
it
at
that
the
man
collapsed
entirely
ah
gott
he
cried
and
raised
his
hand
to
his
clammy
forehead
you
will
ruin
me
i
am
a
ruined
man
i
do
try
to
extort
anything
i
run
an
honest
business
and
one
of
the
most
profitable
in
the
world
added
harley
since
the
days
of
thais
to
our
own
even
at
bond
street
rentals
i
assume
that
a
house
of
assignation
is
a
golden
ah
groaned
meyer
i
am
ruined
so
what
does
it
matter
i
tell
you
everything
i
know
de
lana
who
engages
my
room
regularly
but
i
do
know
who
the
lady
is
who
meets
him
here
no
i
swear
it
but
always
it
is
the
same
lady
when
he
falls
i
am
downstairs
in
my
office
and
i
hear
him
cry
out
the
lady
comes
running
from
the
room
and
begs
of
me
to
get
her
away
without
being
seen
and
to
keep
all
mention
of
her
out
of
the
what
did
she
pay
you
asked
harley
pay
me
muttered
meyer
pulled
up
thus
shortly
in
the
midst
of
his
statement
pay
you
exactly
do
argue
the
man
delivered
himself
of
a
guttural
choking
sound
and
finally
she
promised
one
hundred
pounds
he
confessed
hoarsely
but
you
surely
did
not
accept
a
mere
promise
out
with
it
what
did
she
give
you
a
ring
came
the
confession
at
last
a
ring
i
see
i
will
take
it
with
me
if
you
do
mind
and
now
finally
what
was
it
that
she
left
behind
ah
gott
moaned
the
man
dropping
into
a
chair
and
resting
his
arms
upon
the
table
it
is
all
a
great
panic
you
see
i
hurry
her
out
by
the
back
stair
from
this
landing
and
she
forgets
her
her
bag
then
i
clear
away
the
remains
of
dinner
so
i
can
say
de
lana
is
dining
alone
it
is
as
much
my
interest
as
the
of
course
i
quite
understand
i
will
trouble
you
no
more
meyer
except
to
step
into
your
office
and
to
relieve
you
of
that
incriminating
evidence
the
lady
bag
and
her
iv
the
slanting
eyes
do
you
understand
knox
said
harley
as
the
cab
bore
us
toward
hamilton
place
do
you
grasp
the
details
of
this
cunning
scheme
on
the
contrary
i
replied
i
am
hopelessly
at
nevertheless
i
had
forgotten
that
i
was
hungry
in
the
excitement
which
now
claimed
me
for
although
the
thread
upon
which
these
seemingly
disconnected
things
hung
was
invisible
to
me
i
recognized
that
bampton
the
city
clerk
the
bearded
stranger
who
had
made
so
singular
a
proposition
to
him
the
major
the
dead
stockbroker
and
the
mysterious
woman
whose
presence
in
the
case
the
clear
sight
of
harley
had
promptly
detected
all
were
linked
together
by
some
subtle
chain
i
was
convinced
too
that
my
friend
held
at
least
one
end
of
that
chain
in
his
grip
in
order
to
prepare
your
mind
for
the
interview
which
i
hope
to
obtain
this
evening
continued
harley
let
me
enlighten
you
upon
one
or
two
points
which
may
seem
obscure
in
the
first
place
you
recognize
that
anyone
leaning
out
of
the
window
on
the
second
floor
would
almost
automatically
rest
his
weight
upon
the
iron
bar
which
was
placed
there
for
that
very
purpose
since
the
ledge
is
unusually
low
quite
i
replied
and
it
also
follows
that
if
the
bar
gave
way
anyone
thus
leaning
on
it
would
be
pitched
into
the
your
reasoning
is
but
my
dear
fellow
said
i
how
could
such
an
accident
have
been
foreseen
you
speak
of
an
accident
this
was
no
accident
one
end
of
the
bar
had
been
filed
completely
through
although
the
file
marks
had
been
carefully
concealed
with
rust
and
dirt
and
the
other
end
had
been
wrenched
out
from
its
socket
and
then
replaced
in
such
a
way
that
anyone
leaning
upon
the
bar
could
not
fail
to
be
precipitated
into
the
street
good
heavens
then
you
mean
i
mean
knox
that
the
man
who
occupied
the
supper
room
on
the
night
before
the
tragedy
the
dark
man
tanned
and
bearded
with
slightly
oblique
eyes
his
time
in
filing
through
that
bar
in
short
in
preparing
a
death
trap
i
was
almost
dumbfounded
but
harley
i
said
assuming
that
he
knew
his
victim
would
be
the
next
occupant
of
the
room
how
could
he
know
i
stopped
suddenly
as
if
a
curtain
had
been
raised
the
details
of
what
i
now
perceived
to
be
a
fiendishly
cunning
murder
were
revealed
to
me
according
to
his
own
account
knox
resumed
harley
major
ragstaff
regularly
passed
along
that
street
with
military
punctuality
at
the
same
hour
every
night
you
may
take
it
for
granted
that
the
murderer
was
well
aware
of
this
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
happen
to
know
that
he
was
we
must
also
take
it
for
granted
that
the
murderer
knew
of
these
little
dinners
for
two
which
took
place
in
the
private
room
above
the
cafe
dame
every
wednesday
and
sometimes
on
friday
around
the
figure
of
the
methodical
major
with
his
conspicuous
white
hat
as
a
sort
of
focus
was
built
up
one
of
the
most
ingenious
schemes
of
murder
with
which
i
have
ever
come
in
contact
the
victim
literally
killed
but
harley
the
victim
might
have
ignored
the
that
is
where
i
first
detected
the
touch
of
genius
knox
he
recognized
the
voice
of
one
of
the
combatants
or
his
companion
did
here
we
the
cab
drew
up
before
the
house
in
hamilton
place
we
alighted
and
harley
pressed
the
bell
the
same
footman
whom
i
had
seen
admit
the
woman
opened
the
door
is
lady
ireton
at
home
asked
harley
as
he
uttered
the
name
i
literally
held
my
breath
we
had
come
to
the
house
of
major
ragstaff
daughter
the
marchioness
of
ireton
one
of
society
most
celebrated
and
beautiful
hostesses
the
wife
of
a
peer
famed
alike
as
sportsman
soldier
and
scholar
i
believe
she
is
dining
at
home
sir
said
the
man
shall
i
inquire
be
good
enough
to
do
so
replied
harley
and
gave
him
a
card
inform
her
that
i
wish
to
return
to
her
a
handbag
which
she
lost
a
few
days
the
man
ushered
us
into
an
anteroom
opening
off
the
lofty
and
rather
gloomy
hall
and
as
the
door
closed
harley
i
said
in
a
stage
whisper
am
i
to
believe
can
you
doubt
it
returned
harley
with
a
grim
smile
a
few
moments
later
we
were
shown
into
a
charmingly
intimate
little
boudoir
in
which
lady
ireton
was
waiting
to
receive
us
she
was
a
strikingly
handsome
brunette
but
her
face
which
normally
i
think
possessed
rich
colouring
was
almost
pallid
and
there
was
a
hunted
look
in
her
dark
eyes
which
made
me
wish
to
be
anywhere
rather
than
where
i
found
myself
without
preamble
she
rose
and
addressed
harley
i
fail
to
understand
your
message
sir
she
said
and
i
admired
the
imperious
courage
with
which
she
faced
him
you
say
you
have
recovered
a
handbag
which
i
had
lost
harley
bowed
and
from
the
pocket
of
his
greatcoat
took
out
a
bag
the
one
which
you
left
in
the
cafe
dame
lady
ireton
he
replied
here
also
i
have
from
another
pocket
he
drew
out
a
diamond
ring
something
which
was
extorted
from
you
by
the
fellow
without
touching
her
recovered
property
lady
ireton
sank
slowly
down
into
the
chair
from
which
she
had
arisen
her
gaze
fixed
as
if
hypnotically
upon
the
speaker
my
friend
knox
is
aware
of
all
the
circumstances
continued
the
latter
but
he
is
as
anxious
as
i
am
to
terminate
this
painful
interview
i
surmise
that
what
occurred
on
wednesday
night
was
this
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
while
dining
with
de
lana
you
heard
sounds
of
altercation
in
the
street
below
may
i
suggest
that
you
recognized
one
of
the
voices
lady
ireton
still
staring
straight
before
her
at
harley
inclined
her
head
in
assent
i
heard
my
father
voice
she
said
hoarsely
quite
so
he
continued
i
am
aware
that
major
ragstaff
is
your
he
turned
to
me
do
you
recognize
the
touch
of
genius
at
last
then
again
addressing
lady
ireton
you
naturally
suggested
to
your
companion
that
he
should
look
out
of
the
window
in
order
to
learn
what
was
taking
place
the
next
thing
you
knew
was
that
he
had
fallen
into
the
street
below
lady
ireton
shuddered
and
raised
her
hands
to
her
face
it
is
retribution
she
whispered
i
have
brought
this
ruin
upon
myself
but
he
does
not
deserve
her
voice
faded
into
silence
and
you
refer
to
your
husband
lord
ireton
said
harley
lady
ireton
nodded
and
again
recovering
power
of
speech
it
was
to
have
been
our
last
meeting
she
said
looking
up
at
harley
she
shuddered
and
her
eyes
blazed
into
sudden
fierceness
then
clenching
her
hands
she
looked
aside
oh
god
the
shame
of
this
hour
she
whispered
and
i
would
have
given
much
to
have
been
spared
the
spectacle
of
this
proud
erring
woman
humiliation
but
paul
harley
was
scientifically
remorseless
i
could
detect
no
pity
in
his
glance
i
would
give
my
life
willingly
to
spare
my
husband
the
knowledge
of
what
has
been
said
lady
ireton
in
a
low
monotonous
voice
three
times
i
sent
my
maid
to
meyer
to
recover
my
bag
but
he
demanded
a
price
which
even
i
could
not
pay
now
it
is
all
discovered
and
harry
will
that
i
fear
is
unavoidable
lady
ireton
declared
harley
may
i
ask
where
lord
ireton
is
at
present
he
is
in
africa
after
big
h
said
harley
in
africa
and
after
big
game
i
can
offer
you
one
consolation
lady
ireton
in
his
own
interests
meyer
will
stick
to
his
first
assertion
that
de
lana
was
dining
a
strange
horribly
pathetic
look
came
into
the
woman
haunted
eyes
you
you
are
not
acting
for
she
began
i
am
acting
for
no
one
replied
harley
tersely
upon
my
discretion
you
may
rely
as
upon
my
then
why
should
he
ever
know
she
whispered
why
indeed
murmured
harley
since
he
is
in
africa
as
we
descended
the
stair
to
the
hall
my
friend
paused
and
pointed
to
a
oil
painting
by
london
most
fashionable
portrait
painter
it
was
that
of
a
man
in
the
uniform
of
a
guards
officer
a
dark
man
slightly
gray
at
the
temples
his
face
very
tanned
as
if
by
exposure
to
the
sun
having
had
no
occasion
for
disguise
when
the
portrait
was
painted
said
harley
lord
ireton
appears
here
without
the
beard
and
as
he
is
not
represented
smiling
one
can
not
see
the
gold
tooth
but
the
painter
if
anything
has
accentuated
the
slanting
eyes
you
see
the
fourth
marquis
the
present
lord
ireton
father
married
one
of
the
yen
sun
girls
daughters
of
the
mandarin
of
that
name
by
an
irish
wife
hence
the
eyes
and
hence
but
harley
it
was
murder
not
within
the
meaning
of
the
law
knox
it
was
a
recrudescence
of
chinese
humour
lord
ireton
is
officially
in
africa
and
he
went
actually
after
game
the
counsel
is
not
born
who
could
secure
a
conviction
we
are
somewhat
late
but
shall
therefore
have
less
difficulty
in
finding
a
table
at
tcheriapin
i
the
rose
examine
it
closely
said
the
man
in
the
unusual
caped
overcoat
it
will
repay
i
held
the
little
object
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
bending
forward
over
the
table
and
looking
down
at
it
with
deep
curiosity
the
babel
of
tongues
so
characteristic
of
malay
jack
and
that
mingled
odour
of
stale
spirits
greasy
humanity
tobacco
cheap
perfume
and
opium
which
distinguish
the
establishment
faded
from
my
ken
a
sense
of
loneliness
came
to
me
perhaps
i
should
say
that
it
became
complete
i
had
grown
conscious
of
its
approach
at
the
very
moment
that
the
cadaverous
man
had
addressed
me
there
was
a
quality
in
his
steadfast
gaze
and
in
his
oddly
pitched
deep
voice
which
from
the
first
had
wrapped
me
about
as
though
he
were
cloaking
me
in
his
queer
personality
and
withdrawing
me
from
the
common
plane
having
stared
for
some
moments
at
the
object
in
my
palm
i
touched
it
gingerly
whereupon
my
acquaintance
laughed
a
short
bass
laugh
it
looks
fragile
he
said
but
have
no
fear
it
is
nearly
as
hard
as
a
thus
encouraged
i
took
the
thing
up
between
finger
and
thumb
and
held
it
before
my
eyes
for
long
enough
i
looked
at
it
and
looking
my
wonder
grew
i
thought
that
here
was
the
most
wonderful
example
of
the
lapidary
art
which
i
had
ever
met
with
east
or
west
it
was
a
tiny
pink
rose
no
larger
than
the
nail
of
my
little
finger
stalk
and
leaves
were
there
and
golden
pollen
lay
in
its
delicate
heart
each
blushed
with
june
fire
the
frail
leaves
were
exquisitely
green
withal
it
was
as
hard
and
unbendable
as
a
thing
of
steel
allow
me
said
the
masterful
voice
a
powerful
lens
was
passed
by
my
acquaintance
i
regarded
the
rose
through
the
glass
and
thereupon
i
knew
beyond
doubt
that
there
was
something
phenomenal
about
the
gem
if
gem
it
were
i
could
plainly
trace
the
veins
and
texture
of
every
petal
i
suppose
i
looked
somewhat
startled
although
baldly
stated
the
fact
may
not
seem
calculated
to
affright
in
reality
there
was
something
so
weird
about
this
unnatural
bloom
that
i
dropped
it
on
the
table
as
i
did
so
i
uttered
an
exclamation
for
in
spite
of
the
assurances
on
the
point
i
had
by
no
means
overcome
my
idea
of
the
thing
fragility
do
be
alarmed
he
said
meeting
my
startled
gaze
it
would
need
a
to
do
any
serious
he
replaced
the
jewel
in
his
pocket
and
when
i
returned
the
lens
to
him
he
acknowledged
it
with
a
grave
inclination
of
the
head
as
i
looked
into
his
sunken
eyes
in
which
i
thought
lay
a
sort
of
sardonic
merriment
the
fantastic
idea
flashed
through
my
mind
that
i
had
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
an
expert
hypnotist
who
was
amusing
himself
at
my
expense
that
the
miniature
rose
was
a
mere
hallucination
produced
by
the
same
means
as
the
notorious
indian
rope
trick
then
looking
around
me
at
the
cosmopolitan
groups
surrounding
the
many
tables
and
catching
snatches
of
conversations
dealing
with
subjects
so
diverse
as
the
quality
of
whisky
in
singapore
the
frail
beauty
of
chinese
maidens
and
the
ways
of
bloody
greasers
common
sense
reasserted
itself
i
looked
into
the
gray
face
of
my
acquaintance
i
can
not
believe
i
said
slowly
that
human
ingenuity
could
so
closely
duplicate
the
handiwork
of
nature
surely
the
gem
is
unique
possibly
one
of
those
magical
talismans
of
which
we
read
in
eastern
stories
my
companion
smiled
it
is
not
a
gem
he
replied
and
while
in
a
sense
it
is
a
product
of
human
ingenuity
it
is
also
the
handiwork
of
i
was
badly
puzzled
and
doubtless
revealed
the
fact
for
the
stranger
laughed
in
his
short
fashion
and
i
am
not
trying
to
mystify
you
he
assured
me
but
the
truth
is
so
hard
to
believe
sometimes
that
in
the
present
case
i
hesitate
to
divulge
it
did
you
ever
meet
tcheriapin
this
abrupt
change
of
topic
somewhat
startled
me
but
nevertheless
i
once
heard
him
play
i
replied
why
do
you
ask
the
question
for
this
reason
tcheriapin
possessed
the
only
other
example
of
this
art
which
so
far
as
i
am
aware
ever
left
the
laboratory
of
the
inventor
he
occasionally
wore
it
in
his
it
is
then
a
manufactured
product
of
some
sort
as
i
have
said
in
a
sense
it
is
but
he
drew
the
tiny
exquisite
ornament
from
his
pocket
again
and
held
it
up
before
me
it
is
a
natural
what
it
is
a
natural
bloom
replied
my
acquaintance
fixing
his
penetrating
gaze
upon
me
by
a
perfectly
simple
process
invented
by
the
cleverest
chemist
of
his
age
it
had
been
reduced
to
this
state
while
retaining
unimpaired
every
one
of
its
natural
beauties
every
shade
of
its
natural
colour
you
are
incredulous
on
the
contrary
i
replied
having
examined
it
through
a
magnifying
glass
i
had
already
assured
myself
that
no
human
hand
had
fashioned
it
you
arouse
my
curiosity
intensely
such
a
process
with
its
endless
possibilities
should
be
worth
a
fortune
to
the
the
stranger
nodded
grimly
and
again
concealed
the
rose
in
his
pocket
you
are
right
he
said
and
the
secret
died
with
the
man
who
discovered
it
in
the
great
explosion
at
the
vortex
works
in
you
recall
it
the
factory
it
shook
all
london
and
fragments
were
cast
into
three
i
recall
it
perfectly
you
remember
also
the
death
of
kreener
the
chief
chemist
he
died
in
an
endeavour
to
save
some
of
the
i
he
was
the
inventor
of
the
process
but
it
was
never
put
upon
the
market
he
was
a
singular
man
sir
as
was
once
said
of
him
don
juan
of
science
dame
nature
gave
him
her
heart
unwooed
he
trifled
with
science
as
some
men
trifle
with
love
tossing
aside
with
a
smile
discoveries
which
would
have
made
another
famous
this
tapping
his
breast
pocket
was
one
of
you
astound
me
do
i
understand
you
to
mean
that
kreener
had
invented
a
process
for
reducing
any
form
of
plant
life
to
this
condition
almost
any
form
was
the
guarded
reply
and
some
forms
of
animal
what
if
you
like
the
stranger
leaned
forward
and
grasped
my
arm
i
will
tell
you
the
story
of
kreener
last
i
was
now
intensely
interested
i
had
not
forgotten
the
heroic
death
of
the
man
concerning
whose
work
this
chance
acquaintance
of
mine
seemed
to
know
so
much
and
in
the
cadaverous
face
of
the
stranger
as
he
sat
there
regarding
me
fixedly
there
was
a
promise
and
an
allurement
i
stood
on
the
verge
of
strange
things
so
that
looking
into
the
eyes
once
again
i
felt
the
cloak
being
drawn
about
me
and
i
resigned
myself
willingly
to
the
illusion
from
the
moment
when
he
began
to
speak
again
until
that
when
i
rose
and
followed
him
from
malay
jack
as
i
shall
presently
relate
i
became
oblivious
of
my
surroundings
i
lived
and
moved
through
those
last
fevered
hours
in
the
lives
of
kreener
tcheriapin
the
violinist
and
that
other
tragic
figure
around
whom
the
story
centred
i
append
the
stranger
story
i
asked
you
said
the
man
in
the
caped
coat
if
you
had
ever
seen
tcheriapin
and
you
replied
that
you
had
once
heard
him
play
having
once
heard
him
play
you
will
not
have
forgotten
him
at
that
time
although
war
still
raged
all
musical
london
was
asking
where
he
had
come
from
and
to
what
nation
he
belonged
then
when
he
disappeared
it
was
variously
reported
you
will
recall
that
he
had
been
shot
as
a
spy
and
that
he
had
escaped
from
england
and
was
serving
with
the
austrian
army
as
to
his
parentage
i
can
enlighten
you
in
a
measure
he
was
a
eurasian
his
father
was
an
aristocratic
chinaman
and
his
mother
a
polish
that
was
his
parentage
but
i
would
scarcely
hesitate
to
affirm
that
he
came
from
hell
and
i
shall
presently
show
you
that
he
has
certainly
returned
there
you
remember
the
strange
stories
current
about
him
the
cunning
ones
said
that
he
had
a
clever
press
agent
this
was
true
enough
one
of
the
most
prominent
agents
in
london
discovered
him
playing
in
a
paris
cabaret
two
months
later
he
was
playing
at
the
queen
hall
and
musical
london
lay
at
his
feet
he
had
something
of
the
personality
of
paganini
as
you
remember
except
that
he
was
a
smaller
man
long
gaunt
yellowish
hands
and
the
face
of
a
haggard
mephistopheles
the
critics
quarrelled
about
him
as
critics
only
quarrel
about
real
genius
and
while
one
school
proclaimed
that
tcheriapin
had
discovered
an
entirely
new
technique
a
revolutionary
system
of
violin
playing
another
school
was
equally
positive
in
declaring
that
he
could
not
play
at
all
that
he
was
a
mountebank
a
trickster
whose
proper
place
was
in
a
variety
theatre
there
were
stories
too
that
were
never
published
not
only
about
tcheriapin
but
concerning
the
strad
upon
which
he
played
if
all
this
atmosphere
of
mystery
which
surrounded
the
man
had
truly
been
the
work
of
a
press
agent
then
the
agent
must
have
been
as
great
a
genius
as
his
client
but
i
can
assure
you
that
the
stories
concerning
tcheriapin
true
and
absurd
alike
were
not
inspired
for
business
purposes
they
grew
up
around
him
like
fungi
i
can
see
him
now
a
lean
almost
emaciated
figure
with
slow
sinuous
movements
and
a
trick
of
glancing
sideways
with
those
dark
unfathomable
slightly
oblique
eyes
he
could
take
up
his
bow
in
such
a
way
as
to
create
an
atmosphere
of
electrical
suspense
he
was
loathsome
yet
fascinating
one
mental
attitude
toward
him
was
one
of
defence
of
being
tensely
on
guard
then
he
would
play
you
have
heard
him
play
and
it
is
therefore
unnecessary
for
me
to
attempt
to
describe
the
effect
of
that
music
the
only
composition
which
ever
bore
his
name
i
refer
to
the
black
mass
affected
me
on
every
occasion
when
i
heard
it
as
no
other
composition
has
ever
done
perhaps
it
was
tcheriapin
playing
rather
than
the
music
itself
which
reached
down
into
hitherto
depths
within
me
and
awakened
dark
things
which
unsuspected
lay
there
sleeping
i
never
heard
the
black
mass
played
by
anyone
else
indeed
i
am
not
aware
that
it
was
ever
published
but
had
it
been
we
should
rarely
hear
it
like
locke
music
to
macbeth
it
bears
an
unpleasant
reputation
to
include
it
in
any
concert
programme
would
be
to
court
disaster
an
idle
superstition
perhaps
but
there
is
much
naivete
in
the
artistic
temperament
men
detested
tcheriapin
yet
when
he
chose
he
could
win
over
his
bitterest
enemies
women
followed
him
as
children
followed
the
pied
piper
he
courted
none
but
was
courted
by
all
he
would
glance
aside
with
those
black
slanting
eyes
shrug
in
his
insolent
fashion
and
turn
away
and
they
would
follow
god
knows
how
many
of
them
followed
whether
through
the
dens
of
limehouse
or
the
more
fashionable
salons
of
vice
in
the
west
end
they
followed
perhaps
down
to
hell
so
much
for
tcheriapin
at
the
time
when
the
episode
occurred
to
which
i
have
referred
kreener
occupied
a
house
in
regent
park
to
which
when
his
duties
at
the
munition
works
allowed
he
would
sometimes
retire
at
he
was
a
man
of
complex
personality
i
think
no
one
ever
knew
him
thoroughly
indeed
i
doubt
if
he
knew
himself
he
was
with
the
painters
sculptors
poets
and
social
reformers
who
have
made
of
soho
a
new
mecca
no
movement
in
art
was
so
modern
that
kreener
was
not
conversant
with
it
no
development
in
bolshevism
so
violent
or
so
secret
that
kreener
could
not
speak
of
it
complacently
and
with
inside
knowledge
these
were
his
bohemian
friends
these
dreamers
and
schemers
of
this
side
of
his
life
his
scientific
colleagues
knew
little
or
nothing
but
in
his
hours
of
leisure
at
regent
park
it
was
with
these
dreamers
that
he
loved
to
surround
himself
rather
than
with
his
brethren
of
the
laboratory
i
think
if
kreener
had
not
been
a
great
chemist
he
would
have
been
a
great
painter
or
perhaps
a
politician
or
even
a
poet
triumph
was
his
birthright
and
the
fruits
for
which
lesser
men
reached
out
in
vain
fell
ripe
into
his
hands
the
favourite
for
these
oddly
assorted
boon
companions
was
the
doctor
laboratory
which
was
divided
from
the
house
by
a
moderately
large
garden
here
on
a
sunday
evening
one
might
meet
the
very
latest
composer
the
sculptor
bringing
a
new
message
or
the
man
destined
to
supplant
with
the
ballet
the
operatic
tradition
but
while
some
of
these
would
come
and
go
so
that
one
could
never
count
with
certainty
upon
meeting
them
there
was
one
who
never
failed
to
be
present
when
such
an
informal
reception
was
held
of
him
i
must
speak
at
greater
length
for
a
reason
which
will
shortly
appear
andrews
was
the
name
by
which
he
was
known
to
the
circles
in
which
he
moved
no
one
from
sir
john
tennier
the
fashionable
portrait
painter
to
kruski
of
the
russian
ballet
disputed
andrews
right
to
be
counted
one
of
the
elect
yet
it
was
known
nor
did
he
trouble
to
hide
the
fact
that
andrews
was
employed
at
a
large
printing
works
in
south
london
designing
advertisements
he
was
a
great
unkempt
scotsman
and
only
once
can
i
remember
to
have
seen
him
strictly
sober
but
to
hear
him
talk
about
painters
and
painting
in
his
thick
caledonian
accent
was
to
look
into
the
soul
of
an
artist
he
was
as
sour
as
an
unripe
cynical
embittered
a
man
savagely
disappointed
with
life
and
the
world
and
tragedy
was
written
all
over
him
if
anyone
knew
the
secret
of
his
wasted
life
it
was
kreener
and
kreener
was
a
reliquary
of
so
many
secrets
that
this
one
was
safe
as
if
the
grave
had
swallowed
it
one
sunday
tcheriapin
joined
the
party
that
he
would
gravitate
there
sooner
or
later
was
inevitable
for
the
laboratory
in
the
garden
was
a
kaaba
to
which
all
such
spirits
made
at
least
one
pilgrimage
he
had
just
set
musical
london
on
fire
with
his
barbaric
playing
and
already
those
stories
to
which
i
have
referred
were
creeping
into
circulation
although
kreener
never
expected
anything
of
his
guests
beyond
an
interchange
of
ideas
it
was
a
fact
that
the
laboratory
contained
an
almost
unique
collection
of
pencil
and
charcoal
studies
by
famous
artists
done
upon
the
spot
of
statuettes
in
wax
putty
soap
and
other
extemporized
materials
by
the
newest
sculptors
while
often
enough
from
the
drawing
room
which
opened
upon
the
other
end
of
the
garden
had
issued
the
strains
of
masterly
and
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
little
groups
to
gather
in
the
neighbouring
road
to
listen
gratis
to
the
voice
of
some
great
vocalist
from
the
first
moment
of
their
meeting
an
intense
antagonism
sprang
up
between
tcheriapin
and
andrews
neither
troubled
very
much
to
veil
it
in
tcheriapin
it
found
expression
in
covert
sneers
and
sidelong
glances
while
the
big
scotsman
snorted
open
contempt
of
the
eurasian
violinist
however
what
i
was
about
to
say
was
that
tcheriapin
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
visit
brought
his
violin
it
was
there
amid
these
incongruous
surroundings
that
i
first
had
my
spirit
tortured
by
the
strains
of
the
black
there
were
five
of
us
present
including
tcheriapin
and
not
one
of
the
four
listeners
was
unaffected
by
the
music
but
the
influence
which
it
exercised
upon
andrews
was
so
extraordinary
as
almost
to
reach
the
phenomenal
he
literally
writhed
in
his
chair
and
finally
interrupted
the
performance
by
staggering
rather
than
walking
out
of
the
laboratory
i
remember
that
he
upset
a
jar
of
acid
in
his
stumbling
exit
it
flowed
across
the
floor
almost
to
the
feet
of
tcheriapin
and
the
way
in
which
the
little
man
skipped
squealing
out
of
the
path
of
the
corroding
fluid
was
curiously
like
that
of
a
startled
rabbit
order
was
restored
in
due
course
but
we
could
not
induce
tcheriapin
to
play
again
nor
did
andrews
return
until
the
violinist
had
taken
his
departure
we
found
him
in
the
dining
room
a
nearly
empty
beside
him
i
had
to
gang
awa
he
explained
thickly
he
was
temptin
me
to
murder
him
i
should
ha
had
to
do
it
if
i
had
stayed
damn
his
tcheriapin
revisited
kreener
on
many
occasions
afterward
although
for
a
long
time
he
did
not
bring
his
violin
again
the
doctor
had
prevailed
upon
andrews
to
tolerate
the
eurasian
company
and
i
could
not
help
noticing
how
tcheriapin
skilfully
and
deliberately
goaded
the
scotsman
seeming
to
take
a
fiendish
delight
in
disagreeing
with
his
pet
theories
and
in
discussing
any
topic
which
he
had
found
to
be
distasteful
to
andrews
chief
among
these
was
that
sort
of
irreverent
criticism
of
women
in
which
male
parties
so
often
indulge
bitter
cynic
though
he
was
women
were
sacred
to
andrews
to
speak
disrespectfully
of
a
woman
in
his
presence
was
like
uttering
blasphemy
in
the
study
of
a
cardinal
tcheriapin
very
quickly
detected
the
scotsman
weakness
and
one
night
he
launched
out
into
a
series
of
amorous
adventures
which
set
andrews
writhing
as
he
had
writhed
under
the
torture
of
the
black
on
this
occasion
the
party
was
only
a
small
one
comprising
myself
kreener
andrews
and
tcheriapin
i
could
feel
the
storm
brewing
but
was
powerless
to
check
it
how
presently
it
was
to
break
in
tragic
violence
i
could
not
foresee
fate
had
not
meant
that
i
should
foresee
it
allowing
for
the
free
play
of
an
extravagant
artistic
mind
career
on
his
own
showing
had
been
that
of
a
callous
blackguard
i
began
by
being
disgusted
and
ended
by
being
fascinated
not
by
the
man
scandalous
adventures
but
by
the
scarcely
human
psychology
of
the
narrator
from
warsaw
to
budapesth
shanghai
to
paris
and
cairo
to
london
he
passed
leaving
ruin
behind
him
with
a
smile
airily
flicking
cigarette
ash
upon
the
floor
to
indicate
the
termination
of
each
andrews
watched
him
in
a
lowering
way
which
i
did
not
like
at
all
he
had
ceased
to
snort
his
scorn
indeed
for
ten
minutes
or
so
he
had
uttered
no
word
or
sound
but
there
was
something
in
the
pose
of
his
ungainly
body
which
strangely
suggested
that
of
a
great
dog
preparing
to
spring
presently
the
violinist
recalled
what
he
termed
a
charming
idyll
of
there
is
one
poor
fool
in
the
world
he
said
shrugging
his
slight
shoulders
who
never
knew
how
badly
he
should
hate
me
ha
ha
of
him
i
shall
tell
you
do
you
remember
my
friends
some
few
years
ago
a
picture
that
was
published
in
paris
and
london
everybody
bought
it
everybody
said
is
a
made
man
this
fellow
who
can
paint
so
fine
to
what
picture
do
you
refer
asked
kreener
it
was
called
dream
at
dawn
as
he
spoke
the
words
i
saw
andrews
start
forward
and
kreener
exchanged
a
swift
glance
with
him
but
the
scotsman
unseen
by
the
vainglorious
shook
his
head
fiercely
the
picture
to
which
tcheriapin
referred
will
of
course
be
perfectly
familiar
to
you
it
had
phenomenal
popularity
some
eight
years
ago
nothing
was
known
of
the
painter
whose
name
was
colquhoun
and
nothing
has
been
seen
of
his
work
since
the
original
painting
was
never
sold
and
after
a
time
this
promising
new
artist
was
of
course
forgotten
presently
tcheriapin
continued
it
is
the
figure
of
a
slender
girl
ah
angels
of
grace
what
a
girl
he
kissed
his
hand
rapturously
she
is
posed
bending
gracefully
forward
and
looking
down
at
her
own
lovely
reflection
in
the
water
it
is
a
seashore
you
remember
and
the
little
ripples
play
about
her
ankles
the
first
blush
of
the
dawn
robes
her
white
body
in
a
transparent
mantle
of
light
ah
god
mercy
it
was
as
she
stood
so
in
a
little
cove
of
normandy
that
i
saw
her
he
paused
rolling
his
dark
eyes
and
i
could
hear
andrews
heavy
breathing
then
it
was
the
art
the
posing
of
the
model
not
in
a
lighted
studio
but
in
the
scene
to
be
depicted
and
the
fellow
who
painted
her
the
man
with
the
barbarous
name
bah
he
was
big
as
big
as
our
andrews
and
ugly
pooh
uglier
than
he
a
with
cropped
skull
like
a
and
no
soul
but
yes
he
could
paint
dream
at
dawn
was
genius
yes
some
soul
he
must
have
had
he
could
paint
dear
friends
but
he
could
not
love
him
i
counted
as
puff
he
blew
imaginary
down
into
space
her
i
sought
out
and
presently
found
she
told
me
in
those
sweet
stolen
rambles
along
the
shore
when
the
moonlight
made
her
look
like
a
madonna
that
she
was
his
inspiration
his
art
his
life
and
she
wept
she
wept
and
i
kissed
her
tears
away
to
please
her
i
waited
until
dream
at
dawn
was
finished
with
the
finish
of
the
picture
finished
also
his
dream
of
dawn
the
tcheriapin
laughed
and
lighted
a
fresh
cigarette
can
you
believe
that
a
man
could
be
so
stupid
he
never
knew
of
my
existence
this
big
red
booby
he
never
knew
that
i
existed
until
until
his
had
fled
with
me
in
a
week
we
were
in
paris
that
and
i
in
a
month
we
had
quarrelled
i
always
end
these
matters
with
a
quarrel
it
makes
the
complete
finish
she
struck
me
in
the
face
and
i
laughed
she
turned
and
went
away
we
were
tired
of
one
another
ah
again
he
airily
kissed
his
hand
there
were
others
after
i
had
gone
i
heard
for
a
time
but
her
memory
is
like
a
rose
fresh
and
fair
and
sweet
i
am
glad
i
can
remember
her
so
and
not
as
she
afterward
became
that
is
the
art
of
love
she
killed
herself
with
absinthe
my
friends
she
died
in
marseilles
in
the
first
year
of
the
great
thus
far
tcheriapin
had
proceeded
and
was
in
the
act
of
airily
flicking
ash
upon
the
floor
when
uttering
a
sound
which
i
can
only
describe
as
a
roar
andrews
hurled
himself
upon
the
smiling
violinist
his
great
red
hands
clutching
tcheriapin
throat
the
insane
scotsman
for
insane
he
was
at
that
moment
forced
the
other
back
upon
the
settee
from
which
he
had
half
arisen
in
vain
i
sought
to
drag
him
away
from
the
writhing
body
but
i
doubt
that
any
man
could
have
relaxed
that
deadly
grip
tcheriapin
eyes
protruded
hideously
and
his
tongue
lolled
forth
from
his
mouth
one
could
hear
the
breath
whistling
through
his
nostrils
as
andrews
silently
deliberately
squeezed
the
life
out
of
him
it
all
occupied
only
a
few
minutes
and
then
andrews
slowly
opening
his
rigidly
crooked
fingers
stood
panting
and
looking
down
at
the
distorted
face
of
the
dead
man
for
once
in
his
life
the
scotsman
was
sober
and
turning
to
kreener
i
have
waited
seven
long
years
for
this
he
said
and
i
hang
i
can
never
forget
the
ensuing
moments
in
which
amid
a
horrible
silence
broken
only
by
the
ticking
of
a
clock
and
the
heavy
breathing
of
colquhoun
so
long
known
to
us
as
andrews
we
stood
watching
the
contorted
body
on
the
settee
and
as
we
watched
slowly
the
rigid
limbs
began
to
relax
and
tcheriapin
slid
gently
on
to
the
floor
collapsing
there
with
a
soft
thud
where
he
squatted
like
some
hideous
buddha
resting
back
against
the
cushions
one
spectral
yellow
hand
upraised
the
fingers
still
clutching
a
big
gold
tassel
andrews
for
so
i
always
think
of
him
was
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
trembling
and
he
dropped
into
the
chair
muttering
to
himself
and
looking
down
at
his
twitching
fingers
then
he
began
to
laugh
laughter
in
little
short
peals
here
cried
the
doctor
sharply
drop
that
crossing
to
andrews
he
grasped
him
by
the
shoulders
and
shook
him
roughly
the
laughter
ceased
and
send
for
the
police
said
andrews
in
a
queer
shaky
voice
dinna
fear
but
i
ready
i
only
sorry
it
happened
you
ought
to
be
glad
said
kreener
there
was
a
covert
meaning
in
the
words
a
fact
which
penetrated
even
to
the
dulled
intelligence
of
the
scotsman
for
he
glanced
up
haggardly
at
his
friend
you
ought
to
be
glad
repeated
kreener
turning
he
walked
to
the
laboratory
door
and
locked
it
he
next
lowered
all
the
blinds
i
pray
that
we
have
not
been
observed
he
said
but
we
must
chance
he
mixed
a
drink
for
andrews
and
himself
his
quiet
decisive
manner
had
had
its
effect
and
andrews
was
now
more
composed
indeed
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
condition
but
he
persistently
kept
his
back
turned
to
the
crouching
figure
propped
up
against
the
settee
if
you
think
you
can
follow
me
said
kreener
abruptly
i
will
show
you
the
result
of
a
recent
unlocking
a
cupboard
he
took
out
a
tiny
figure
some
two
inches
long
by
one
inch
high
mounted
upon
a
polished
wooden
pedestal
it
was
that
of
a
the
flaky
fur
gleamed
like
the
finest
silk
and
one
felt
that
the
coat
of
the
minute
creature
would
be
as
floss
to
the
touch
whereas
in
reality
it
possessed
the
rigidity
of
steel
literally
one
could
have
done
it
little
damage
with
a
hammer
its
weight
was
extraordinary
i
am
learning
new
things
about
this
process
every
day
continued
kreener
placing
the
little
figure
upon
a
table
for
instance
while
it
seems
to
operate
uniformly
upon
vegetable
matter
there
are
curious
modifications
when
one
applies
it
to
animal
and
mineral
substances
i
have
now
definitely
decided
that
the
result
of
this
particular
inquiry
must
never
be
published
you
colquhoun
i
believe
possess
an
example
of
the
process
a
tiger
lily
i
think
i
must
ask
you
to
return
it
to
me
our
late
friend
tcheriapin
wears
a
pink
rose
in
his
coat
which
i
have
treated
in
the
same
way
i
am
going
to
take
the
liberty
of
removing
he
spoke
in
the
hard
incisive
manner
which
i
had
heard
him
use
in
the
lecture
theatre
and
it
was
evident
enough
that
his
design
was
to
prepare
andrews
for
something
which
he
contemplated
facing
the
scotsman
where
he
sat
hunched
up
in
the
big
armchair
dully
watching
the
speaker
there
is
one
experiment
said
kreener
speaking
very
deliberately
which
i
have
never
before
had
a
suitable
opportunity
of
attempting
of
its
result
i
am
personally
confident
but
science
always
demands
his
voice
rang
now
with
a
note
of
repressed
excitement
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
if
you
were
to
examine
this
little
specimen
very
closely
he
said
and
rested
his
finger
upon
the
tiny
figure
of
the
you
would
find
that
in
one
particular
it
is
imperfect
although
a
diamond
drill
would
have
to
be
employed
to
demonstrate
the
fact
the
animal
organs
despite
their
having
undergone
a
chemical
change
quite
new
to
science
are
intact
perfect
down
to
the
smallest
detail
one
part
of
the
creature
structure
alone
defied
my
process
in
short
dental
enamel
is
impervious
to
it
this
little
animal
otherwise
as
complete
as
when
it
lived
and
breathed
has
no
teeth
i
found
it
necessary
to
extract
them
before
submitting
the
body
to
the
reductionary
he
paused
shall
i
go
on
he
asked
andrews
to
whose
mind
i
think
no
conception
of
the
doctor
project
had
yet
penetrated
shuddered
but
slowly
nodded
his
head
kreener
glanced
across
the
laboratory
at
the
crouching
figure
of
tcheriapin
then
resting
his
hands
upon
andrews
shoulders
he
pushed
him
back
in
the
chair
and
stared
into
his
dull
eyes
brace
yourself
colquhoun
he
said
tersely
turning
he
crossed
to
a
small
mahogany
cabinet
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
pulling
out
a
glass
tray
he
judicially
selected
a
pair
of
dental
forceps
ii
the
black
mass
thus
far
the
stranger
appalling
story
had
progressed
when
that
singular
cloak
in
which
hypnotically
he
had
enwrapped
me
seemed
to
drop
and
i
found
myself
clutching
the
edge
of
the
table
and
staring
into
the
gray
face
of
the
speaker
i
became
suddenly
aware
of
the
babel
of
voices
about
me
of
the
noisome
smell
of
malay
jack
and
of
the
presence
of
jack
in
person
who
was
inquiring
if
there
were
any
further
orders
i
was
conscious
of
nausea
excuse
me
i
said
rising
unsteadily
but
i
fear
the
oppressive
atmosphere
is
affecting
if
you
prefer
to
go
out
said
my
acquaintance
in
that
deep
voice
which
throughout
the
dreadful
story
had
rendered
me
oblivious
of
my
surroundings
i
should
be
much
favoured
if
you
would
accompany
me
to
a
spot
not
five
hundred
yards
from
seeing
me
hesitate
i
have
a
particular
reason
for
asking
he
added
very
well
i
replied
inclining
my
head
if
you
wish
it
but
certainly
i
must
seek
the
fresh
going
up
the
steps
and
out
through
the
door
above
which
the
blue
lantern
burned
we
came
to
the
street
turned
to
the
left
to
the
left
again
and
soon
were
threading
that
maze
of
narrow
ways
which
complicates
the
map
of
pennyfields
i
felt
somewhat
recovered
here
in
the
narrow
but
familiar
highways
the
spell
of
my
singular
acquaintance
lost
much
of
its
potency
and
already
i
found
myself
doubting
the
story
of
kreener
and
tcheriapin
indeed
i
began
to
laugh
at
myself
conceiving
that
i
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
some
comedian
who
was
making
sport
of
me
although
why
such
a
person
should
visit
malay
jack
was
not
apparent
i
was
about
to
give
expression
to
these
new
and
saner
ideas
when
my
companion
paused
before
a
door
half
hidden
in
a
little
alley
which
divided
the
back
of
a
chinese
restaurant
from
the
establishment
of
a
cigar
merchant
he
apparently
held
the
key
for
although
i
did
not
actually
hear
the
turning
of
the
lock
i
saw
that
he
had
opened
the
door
may
i
request
you
to
follow
me
came
his
deep
voice
out
of
the
darkness
i
will
show
you
something
which
will
repay
your
again
the
cloak
touched
me
but
it
was
without
entirely
resigning
myself
to
the
compelling
influence
that
i
followed
my
mysterious
acquaintance
up
an
uncarpeted
and
nearly
dark
stair
on
the
landing
above
a
gas
lamp
was
burning
and
opening
a
door
immediately
facing
the
stair
the
stranger
conducted
me
into
a
barely
furnished
and
untidy
room
the
atmosphere
smelled
like
that
of
a
the
odours
of
stale
spirits
and
of
tobacco
mingling
unpleasantly
as
my
guide
removed
his
hat
and
stood
there
a
square
gaunt
figure
in
his
queer
caped
overcoat
i
secured
for
the
first
time
a
view
of
his
face
in
profile
and
found
it
to
be
startlingly
unfamiliar
seen
thus
my
acquaintance
was
another
man
i
realized
that
there
was
something
unnatural
about
the
long
white
hair
the
gray
face
that
the
sharp
outline
of
brow
nose
and
chin
was
that
of
a
much
younger
man
than
i
had
supposed
him
to
be
all
this
came
to
me
in
a
momentary
flash
of
perception
for
immediately
my
attention
was
riveted
upon
a
figure
hunched
up
on
a
dilapidated
sofa
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
it
was
that
of
a
big
man
bearded
and
very
heavily
built
but
whose
face
was
scarred
as
by
years
of
suffering
and
whose
eyes
confirmed
the
story
indicated
by
the
smell
of
stale
spirits
with
which
the
air
of
the
room
was
laden
a
nearly
empty
bottle
stood
on
a
table
at
his
elbow
a
glass
beside
it
and
a
pipe
lay
in
a
saucer
full
of
ashes
near
the
glass
as
we
entered
the
glazed
eyes
of
the
man
opened
widely
and
he
clutched
at
the
table
with
big
red
hands
leaning
forward
and
staring
horribly
save
for
this
derelict
figure
and
some
few
dirty
utensils
and
scattered
garments
which
indicated
that
the
apartment
was
used
both
as
sleeping
and
living
room
there
was
so
little
of
interest
in
the
place
that
automatically
my
wandering
gaze
strayed
from
the
figure
on
the
sofa
to
a
large
oil
painting
unframed
which
rested
upon
the
mantelpiece
above
the
dirty
grate
in
which
the
fire
had
become
extinguished
i
uttered
a
stifled
exclamation
it
was
a
dream
at
dawn
evidently
the
original
painting
on
the
left
of
it
from
a
nail
in
the
wall
hung
a
violin
and
bow
and
on
the
right
stood
a
sort
of
cylindrical
glass
case
or
closed
jar
upon
a
wooden
base
from
the
moment
that
i
perceived
the
contents
of
this
glass
case
a
sense
of
fantasy
claimed
me
and
i
ceased
to
know
where
reality
ended
and
mirage
began
it
contained
a
tiny
and
perfect
figure
of
a
man
he
was
arrayed
in
a
beautifully
fitting
such
as
a
doll
might
have
worn
and
he
was
posed
as
if
in
the
act
of
playing
a
violin
although
no
violin
was
present
at
the
elfin
black
hair
and
mephistophelian
face
of
this
horrible
wonderful
image
i
stared
fascinatedly
i
looked
and
looked
at
the
dwarfed
figure
of
tcheriapin
all
these
impressions
came
to
me
in
the
space
of
a
few
hectic
moments
when
in
upon
my
mental
tumult
intruded
a
husky
whisper
from
the
man
on
the
sofa
kreener
he
said
kreener
at
the
sound
of
that
name
and
because
of
the
way
in
which
it
was
pronounced
i
felt
my
blood
running
cold
the
speaker
was
staring
straight
at
my
companion
i
clutched
at
the
open
door
i
felt
that
there
was
still
some
crowning
horror
to
come
i
wanted
to
escape
from
that
reeking
room
but
my
muscles
refused
to
obey
me
and
there
i
stood
while
kreener
repeated
the
husky
voice
and
i
saw
that
the
speaker
was
rising
unsteadily
to
his
feet
you
have
brought
him
again
why
have
you

a
step
nearer
to
brace
yourself
colquhoun
said
the
voice
of
my
companion
brace
take
him
awa
came
in
a
sudden
frenzied
shriek
take
him
awa
there
at
your
elbow
kreener
mockin
me
and
pointing
to
that
damned
here
said
the
stranger
a
high
note
of
command
in
his
voice
drop
that
sit
down
at
even
as
the
other
obeyed
him
the
cloaked
stranger
stepping
to
the
mantelpiece
opened
a
small
box
which
lay
there
beside
the
glass
case
he
turned
to
me
and
i
tried
to
shrink
away
from
him
for
i
knew
i
knew
yet
i
loathed
to
look
upon
what
was
in
the
box
muffled
as
though
reaching
me
through
fog
i
heard
the
words
a
perfect
human
body
in
miniature
every
organ
intact
by
means
of
process
rendered
indestructible
tcheriapin
as
he
was
in
life
may
be
seen
by
the
curious
ten
thousand
years
hence
incomplete
one
respect
here
in
this
box
the
spell
was
broken
by
a
horrifying
shriek
from
the
man
whom
my
companion
had
addressed
as
colquhoun
and
whom
i
could
only
suppose
to
be
the
painter
of
the
celebrated
picture
which
rested
upon
the
mantelshelf
take
him
awa
kreener
he
is
reaching
for
the
violin
animation
returned
to
me
and
i
fell
rather
than
ran
down
the
darkened
stair
how
i
opened
the
street
door
i
know
not
but
even
as
i
stepped
out
into
the
squalid
alleys
of
pennyfields
the
cloaked
figure
was
beside
me
a
hand
was
laid
upon
my
shoulder
listen
commanded
a
deep
voice
clearly
with
an
eerie
sweetness
an
evil
hellish
beauty
indescribable
the
wailing
of
a
stradivarius
violin
crept
to
my
ears
from
the
room
above
slowly
slowly
the
music
began
and
my
soul
rose
up
in
revolt
listen
repeated
the
voice
listen
it
is
black
mass
the
dance
of
the
veils
i
the
house
of
the
agapoulos
hassan
came
in
and
began
very
deliberately
to
light
the
four
lamps
he
muttered
to
himself
and
often
smiled
in
the
childish
manner
which
characterizes
some
egyptians
hassan
wore
a
red
cap
and
a
white
robe
confined
at
the
waist
by
a
red
sash
on
his
brown
feet
he
wore
loose
slippers
also
of
red
he
had
good
features
and
made
a
very
picturesque
figure
moving
slowly
about
his
work
as
he
lighted
lamp
after
lamp
and
soft
illumination
crept
about
the
big
room
because
of
the
heavy
shadows
created
the
place
seemed
to
become
mysteriously
enlarged
that
it
was
an
eastern
apartment
cunningly
devised
to
appeal
to
the
western
eye
one
familiar
with
arab
households
must
have
seen
at
once
it
was
a
traditional
oriental
interior
a
stage
setting
rather
than
the
nondescript
and
generally
uninteresting
environment
of
the
modern
egyptian
at
home
brightly
coloured
divans
there
were
and
many
silken
cushions
of
strange
pattern
and
design
the
hanging
lamps
were
of
perforated
brass
with
little
coloured
glass
panels
in
carved
wooden
cabinets
stood
beautiful
porcelain
jars
trays
and
vessels
of
silver
and
copper
ware
rich
carpets
were
spread
about
the
floor
and
the
draperies
were
elegant
and
costly
while
two
deep
windows
projecting
over
the
court
represented
the
best
period
of
arab
architecture
their
intricate
carven
woodwork
had
once
adorned
the
palace
of
a
grand
wazir
agapoulos
had
bought
them
in
cairo
and
had
had
them
fitted
to
his
house
in
chinatown
a
smaller
brass
lamp
of
very
delicate
workmanship
was
suspended
in
each
of
the
recesses
as
hassan
having
lighted
the
four
larger
lanterns
was
proceeding
leisurely
to
light
the
first
of
the
smaller
ones
draperies
before
a
door
at
the
east
end
of
the
room
were
parted
and
agapoulos
came
in
agapoulos
was
a
short
but
portly
greek
whom
the
careless
observer
might
easily
have
mistaken
for
a
jew
he
had
much
of
the
appearance
of
a
bank
manager
having
the
manners
of
one
used
to
making
himself
agreeable
but
also
possessing
the
and
that
comprehensive
glance
which
belongs
to
the
successful
man
of
commerce
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
place
he
brushed
his
neat
black
moustache
with
a
plump
forefinger
a
diamond
ring
which
he
wore
glittered
brilliantly
in
the
coloured
rays
of
the
lanterns
with
his
right
hand
which
rested
in
his
trouser
pocket
he
rattled
keys
his
glance
roved
about
the
room
appraisingly
walking
to
a
beautifully
carved
arab
cabinet
he
rearranged
three
pieces
of
persian
copperware
which
stood
upon
it
he
moved
several
cushions
and
taking
up
a
leopard
skin
which
lay
upon
the
floor
he
draped
it
over
an
ebony
chair
which
was
inlaid
intricately
with
ivory
the
drooping
eyelids
of
agapoulos
drooped
lower
as
returning
to
the
centre
of
the
room
he
critically
surveyed
the
effect
of
these
master
touches
at
the
moment
he
resembled
a
or
rather
one
of
those
artists
who
beautify
the
great
establishments
of
regent
street
the
rue
de
la
paix
and
ruination
avenue
new
york
hassan
lighted
the
sixth
lamp
muttering
smilingly
all
the
time
he
was
about
to
depart
when
agapoulos
addressed
him
in
arabic
there
will
be
a
party
down
from
the
savoy
tonight
hassan
no
one
else
is
to
come
unless
i
am
told
that
accursed
red
policeman
kerry
has
been
about
here
of
late
be
very
hassan
saluted
him
gravely
and
retired
through
one
of
the
draped
openings
in
his
hand
he
held
the
taper
with
which
he
had
lighted
the
lamps
in
order
that
the
draperies
should
not
be
singed
he
had
to
hold
them
widely
apart
for
it
had
not
occurred
to
hassan
to
extinguish
the
taper
the
egyptian
mind
is
complex
in
its
simplicity
agapoulos
from
a
gold
case
extracted
a
cigarette
and
lighting
it
inhaled
the
smoke
contentedly
looking
about
him
the
was
lost
again
in
the
bank
manager
who
has
arranged
a
profitable
overdraft
somewhere
a
bell
rang
hassan
treading
silently
reappeared
crossed
the
room
and
opening
a
finely
carved
door
walked
along
a
corridor
which
it
had
concealed
he
still
carried
the
lighted
taper
presently
there
entered
a
man
whose
serge
suit
revealed
the
figure
of
a
soldier
he
wore
a
soft
gray
felt
hat
and
carried
light
gloves
and
a
cane
his
dark
face
bronzed
by
recent
exposure
to
the
egyptian
sun
was
handsome
in
a
saturnine
fashion
and
a
touch
of
gray
at
the
temples
tended
to
enhance
his
good
looks
he
carried
himself
in
that
kind
of
nonchalant
manner
which
is
not
only
insular
but
almost
insolent
agapoulos
bowed
extravagantly
as
he
laid
his
plump
hand
upon
his
breast
the
diamond
ring
sparkled
in
a
way
most
opulent
and
impressive
i
greet
you
major
grantham
he
said
behold
he
waved
his
hand
glitteringly
all
is
oh
yes
murmured
the
other
glancing
around
without
interest
good
you
are
beginning
to
get
straight
in
your
new
agapoulos
extended
the
prosperous
and
major
grantham
took
and
lighted
a
superior
cigarette
how
many
in
the
party
inquired
the
greek
smilingly
three
and
a
shadow
of
a
frown
appeared
upon
the
face
of
agapoulos
only
three
he
muttered
major
grantham
laughed
you
should
know
me
by
this
time
agapoulos
he
said
the
party
is
small
but
exclusive
you
understand
he
spoke
wearily
as
a
tired
man
speaks
of
distasteful
work
which
he
must
do
there
was
contempt
in
his
voice
contempt
of
agapoulos
and
contempt
of
himself
ah
cried
the
greek
brightening
do
i
know
any
of
them
probably
general
sir
francis
payne
eddie
and
sir
horace
an
party
eh
quite
eddie
is
the
proprietor
of
the
group
of
american
hotels
justly
celebrated
for
their
great
height
and
poisonous
cuisine
while
sir
horace
tipton
alike
as
sportsman
and
soap
manufacturer
is
characteristically
british
of
general
sir
francis
payne
i
need
only
say
that
his
home
services
during
the
war
did
incalculable
harm
to
our
prestige
throughout
the
he
spoke
with
all
the
bitterness
of
a
man
who
has
made
a
failure
of
life
agapoulos
was
quite
restored
to
good
humour
ah
he
exclaimed
brushing
his
moustache
and
rattling
his
keys
sportsmen
eh
major
grantham
dropped
into
the
carven
chair
upon
which
the
greek
had
draped
the
leopard
skin
momentarily
the
leapt
into
life
as
agapoulos
beheld
one
of
his
cunning
effects
destroyed
but
he
forced
a
smile
when
grantham
shrugging
his
shoulders
replied
if
they
are
fools
enough
to
play
the
usual
per
cent
on
the
he
paused
glancing
at
some
ash
upon
the
tip
of
his
cigarette
agapoulos
swiftly
produced
an
ashtray
and
received
the
ash
on
it
in
the
manner
of
a
churchwarden
collecting
half
a
crown
from
a
i
think
continued
grantham
indifferently
that
it
will
be
the
dances
two
of
them
are
over
ah
said
agapoulos
thoughtfully
not
of
course
the
ordinary
programme
major
grantham
looked
up
at
him
with
lazy
insolence
why
ask
he
inquired
does
lucullus
crave
for
sausages
do
philosophers
play
marbles
he
laughed
again
noting
the
rather
blank
look
of
agapoulos
you
do
know
what
i
talking
about
do
you
he
added
i
mean
to
say
that
these
men
have
been
everywhere
and
done
everything
they
have
drunk
wine
sweet
and
sour
and
have
swallowed
the
dregs
i
am
bringing
them
it
is
more
than
enough
declared
the
greek
with
enthusiasm
he
bowed
although
grantham
was
not
looking
at
him
in
the
little
matter
of
fees
i
can
rely
upon
your
discretion
as
always
is
it
not
said
that
a
good
dragoman
is
a
desirable
husband
major
grantham
resettled
himself
in
his
chair
m
agapoulos
he
said
icily
we
have
done
shady
business
together
for
years
both
in
port
said
and
in
london
and
have
remained
the
best
of
friends
two
blackguards
linked
by
our
common
villainy
but
if
this
pleasant
commercial
acquaintance
is
to
continue
let
there
be
no
misunderstanding
between
us
agapoulos
i
may
know
i
a
dragoman
but
in
future
old
friend
he
turned
lazy
eyes
upon
the
greek
for
your
guidance
do
remind
me
of
the
fact
or
i
wring
your
the
drooping
eyelids
of
agapoulos
flickered
significantly
but
it
was
with
a
flourish
more
grand
than
usual
that
he
bowed
pardon
pardon
he
murmured
you
speak
harshly
of
yourself
but
ah
you
do
not
mean
it
we
understand
each
other
eh
i
understand
you
perfectly
drawled
grantham
i
was
merely
advising
you
to
endeavour
to
understand
me
my
party
will
arrive
at
nine
agapoulos
and
i
am
going
back
to
the
savoy
shortly
to
dress
meanwhile
if
hassan
would
bring
me
a
whisky
and
soda
i
should
be
of
course
of
course
he
shall
do
so
at
once
cried
agapoulos
i
will
tell
palpably
glad
to
escape
the
fat
greek
retired
leaving
major
grantham
lolling
there
upon
the
leopard
skin
his
hat
cane
and
gloves
upon
the
carpet
beside
him
and
a
few
moments
later
hassan
the
silent
glided
into
the
extravagant
apartment
bearing
refreshments
placing
his
tray
upon
a
little
beside
major
grantham
he
departed
there
was
a
faint
smell
of
perfume
in
the
room
a
heavy
voluptuous
smell
in
which
the
odour
of
mingled
with
the
pungency
of
myrrh
it
was
very
silent
so
that
when
grantham
mixed
a
drink
the
pleasant
chink
of
glass
upon
glass
rang
out
sharply
ii
zahara
zahara
had
overheard
the
latter
part
of
the
conversation
from
her
own
apartment
once
she
had
even
crept
across
to
the
carven
screen
in
order
that
she
might
peep
through
into
the
big
softly
lighted
room
she
had
interrupted
her
toilet
to
do
so
and
having
satisfied
herself
that
grantham
was
one
of
the
speakers
although
she
had
really
known
this
already
she
had
returned
and
stared
at
herself
critically
in
the
mirror
zahara
whose
father
had
been
a
frenchman
possessed
skin
of
a
subtle
cream
colour
very
far
removed
from
the
warm
brown
of
her
egyptian
mother
but
yet
not
white
at
night
it
appeared
dazzling
for
she
enhanced
its
smooth
creamy
pallor
with
a
wonderful
liquid
solution
which
came
from
paris
it
was
hard
zahara
had
learned
to
avoid
a
certain
streaky
appearance
but
much
practice
had
made
her
an
adept
this
portion
of
her
toilet
she
had
already
completed
and
studying
her
own
reflection
she
wondered
as
she
had
always
wondered
what
agapoulos
could
see
in
safiyeh
safiyeh
was
as
brown
as
a
berry
quite
pretty
for
an
egyptian
girl
as
zahara
admitted
scornfully
but
brown
brown
it
was
a
great
puzzle
to
zahara
the
mystery
of
life
indeed
had
puzzled
little
zahara
very
much
from
the
moment
when
she
had
first
begun
to
notice
things
with
those
big
surprising
blue
eyes
of
hers
right
up
to
the
present
year
of
her
life
she
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
safiyeh
who
was
only
sixteen
knew
more
of
this
mystery
than
she
did
once
shortly
after
the
egyptian
girl
had
come
to
the
house
of
agapoulos
zahara
had
playfully
placed
her
round
white
arm
against
that
of
the
more
dusky
beauty
and
look
she
had
exclaimed
i
am
cream
and
you
are
it
is
true
the
other
had
admitted
in
her
practical
serious
way
but
some
men
do
not
like
cream
all
men
like
zahara
rested
her
elbows
upon
the
table
and
surveyed
the
reflection
of
her
perfect
shoulders
with
disapproval
she
had
been
taught
at
her
mother
knee
that
men
did
not
understand
women
and
she
who
had
been
born
and
reared
in
that
quarter
of
cairo
where
there
is
no
day
but
one
long
night
had
lived
to
learn
the
truth
of
the
lesson
yet
she
was
not
surprised
that
this
was
so
for
zahara
did
not
understand
herself
her
desires
were
so
simple
and
so
seemingly
natural
yet
it
would
appear
that
they
were
contrary
to
the
established
order
of
things
she
was
proud
to
think
that
she
was
french
although
someone
had
told
her
that
the
french
though
brave
were
mercenary
zahara
admired
the
french
for
being
brave
and
thought
it
very
sensible
that
they
should
be
mercenary
for
there
was
nothing
that
zahara
wanted
of
the
world
that
money
could
not
obtain
or
so
she
believed
and
she
knew
no
higher
philosophy
than
the
quest
of
happiness
because
others
did
not
seem
to
share
this
philosophy
she
often
wondered
if
she
could
be
unusual
she
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
she
was
ignorant
if
only
harry
grantham
would
talk
to
her
she
felt
sure
he
could
teach
her
so
much
there
were
so
many
things
that
puzzled
her
she
knew
that
at
she
was
young
for
a
french
girl
although
as
an
egyptian
she
would
have
been
considered
old
she
had
been
taught
that
gold
was
the
key
to
happiness
and
that
man
was
the
ogre
from
whom
this
key
must
be
wheedled
a
ready
pupil
zahara
had
early
acquired
the
art
of
attracting
and
now
at
she
was
a
past
mistress
of
the
great
craft
and
as
her
mirror
told
her
more
beautiful
than
she
had
ever
been
therefore
what
did
agapoulos
see
in
safiyeh
it
was
a
problem
which
made
zahara
head
ache
she
could
not
understand
why
as
her
power
of
winning
men
increased
her
power
to
hold
them
diminished
safiyeh
was
a
mere
inexperienced
child
yet
agapoulos
had
brought
her
to
the
house
and
zahara
wise
in
woman
lore
had
recognized
the
familiar
change
of
manner
it
was
a
great
problem
the
problem
which
doubtless
set
the
first
silver
thread
among
phryne
locks
and
which
now
brought
a
little
perplexed
wrinkle
between
zahara
delicately
pencilled
brows
it
had
not
always
been
so
in
those
early
days
in
cairo
there
had
been
an
american
boy
zahara
had
never
forgotten
her
beauty
had
bewildered
him
he
had
wanted
to
take
her
to
new
york
and
oh
how
she
had
wanted
to
go
but
her
mother
who
was
then
alive
had
held
other
views
and
he
had
gone
alone
heavens
how
old
she
felt
how
many
had
come
and
gone
since
that
egyptian
winter
but
now
although
admiration
was
fatally
easy
to
win
how
few
were
so
sincere
as
that
boy
from
beyond
the
atlantic
zahara
staring
into
the
mirror
observed
that
there
was
not
a
wrinkle
upon
her
face
not
a
flaw
upon
her
perfect
skin
nor
in
this
was
she
blinded
by
vanity
nature
indeed
had
cast
her
in
a
rare
mould
and
from
her
unusual
hair
which
was
like
dull
gold
to
her
slender
ankles
and
tiny
feet
she
was
one
of
the
most
perfectly
fashioned
human
beings
who
ever
added
to
the
beauty
of
the
world
yet
agapoulos
preferred
safiyeh
zahara
could
hear
him
coming
to
her
room
even
as
she
sat
there
chin
in
hands
staring
at
her
own
bewitching
reflection
presently
she
would
slip
out
and
speak
to
harry
grantham
twice
she
had
read
in
his
eyes
that
sort
of
interest
which
she
knew
so
well
how
to
detect
she
liked
him
very
much
but
because
of
a
sense
of
loyalty
to
agapoulos
a
sentiment
purely
egyptian
which
she
longed
to
crush
zahara
had
never
so
much
as
glanced
at
grantham
in
the
right
way
she
was
glad
though
that
he
had
not
gone
and
she
hoped
that
agapoulos
would
not
detain
her
long
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
greek
manner
was
even
more
cold
than
usual
he
rested
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
for
a
moment
and
meeting
her
glance
reflected
in
the
mirror
there
will
be
a
lot
of
money
here
he
said
make
the
best
of
your
opportunities
chinatown
is
foggy
yes
but
it
pays
better
than
port
he
ran
fat
fingers
carelessly
through
her
hair
the
big
diamond
glittering
effectively
in
the
wavy
gold
then
turned
and
went
out
sitting
listening
intently
zahara
could
hear
him
talking
in
a
subdued
voice
to
safiyeh
and
could
detect
the
egyptian
replies
grantham
looked
up
with
a
start
a
new
and
subtle
perfume
had
added
itself
to
that
with
which
the
air
of
the
room
was
already
laden
he
found
zahara
standing
beside
him
his
glance
travelled
upward
from
a
pair
of
absurdly
tiny
brocaded
shoes
past
slender
white
ankles
to
the
embroidered
edge
of
a
wonderful
mandarin
robe
decorated
with
the
figures
of
peacocks
upward
again
to
a
little
bejewelled
hand
which
held
the
robe
confined
about
the
slender
figure
of
zahara
and
upward
to
where
sideways
upon
a
bare
shoulder
peeping
impudently
out
from
chinese
embroidery
rested
the
and
face
of
the
girl
hallo
he
said
smiling
i
did
hear
you
come
i
walk
very
soft
explained
zahara
because
i
am
not
supposed
to
be
she
looked
at
him
quizzically
i
do
see
you
for
a
long
time
she
added
and
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
there
was
a
caress
i
saw
you
more
often
in
port
said
than
no
replied
grantham
i
have
been
giving
agapoulos
a
rest
besides
there
has
been
nobody
worth
while
at
any
of
the
hotels
or
clubs
during
the
last
somebody
worth
while
coming
asked
zahara
with
professional
interest
at
the
very
moment
that
she
uttered
the
words
she
recognized
her
error
for
she
saw
grantham
expression
change
yet
to
her
strange
soul
there
was
a
challenge
in
his
coldness
and
the
joy
of
contest
in
the
task
of
melting
the
ice
of
this
english
reserve
lots
of
money
he
said
bitterly
we
shall
all
do
well
zahara
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
she
wished
to
close
this
line
of
conversation
which
inadvertently
she
had
opened
up
so
that
presently
you
look
very
lonely
and
bored
she
said
softly
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
she
who
was
bored
of
the
life
she
led
in
limehouse
in
chilly
misty
limehouse
and
who
had
grown
so
very
lonely
since
safiyeh
had
come
in
the
dark
gray
eyes
looking
up
at
her
she
read
recognition
of
her
secret
here
was
a
man
possessing
that
rare
masculine
attribute
intuition
zahara
knew
a
fear
that
was
half
delightful
fear
because
she
might
fail
in
either
of
two
ways
and
delight
because
the
contest
was
equal
yes
he
replied
slowly
my
looks
tell
the
truth
how
did
you
know
zahara
observed
that
his
curiosity
had
not
yet
become
actual
interest
she
toyed
with
the
silken
tassel
on
her
robe
tying
and
untying
it
with
quick
nervous
fingers
and
resting
the
while
against
the
side
of
the
carved
chair
perhaps
because
i
am
so
lonely
myself
she
said
i
matter
to
no
one
what
i
do
where
i
go
if
i
live
or
die
it
is
all
she
spread
her
small
hands
eloquently
and
shrugged
so
that
another
white
shoulder
escaped
from
the
chinese
wrapping
thereupon
zahara
demurely
drew
her
robe
about
her
with
a
naive
air
of
modesty
which
nine
out
of
ten
beholding
must
have
supposed
to
be
affected
in
reality
it
was
a
perfectly
natural
instinctive
movement
to
zahara
her
own
beauty
was
a
commonplace
to
be
displayed
or
concealed
as
circumstances
might
dictate
in
a
certain
sense
which
few
could
appreciate
this
dancing
girl
and
daughter
of
el
wasr
was
as
innocent
as
a
baby
it
was
one
of
the
things
which
men
did
not
understand
she
thought
that
if
harry
grantham
asked
her
to
go
away
with
him
it
would
be
nice
to
go
suddenly
she
realized
how
deep
was
her
loathing
of
this
limehouse
and
of
the
people
she
met
there
who
were
all
alike
he
sat
looking
at
her
for
some
time
and
then
perhaps
you
are
wrong
he
said
there
may
be
some
who
could
and
because
he
had
answered
her
thoughts
rather
than
her
words
the
fear
within
zahara
grew
greater
than
the
joy
of
the
contest
awhile
longer
she
stayed
seeking
for
a
chink
in
the
armour
but
she
failed
to
kindle
the
light
in
his
eyes
which
unless
she
had
deluded
herself
she
had
seen
there
in
the
past
and
because
she
failed
and
could
detect
no
note
of
tenderness
in
his
impersonal
curiosity
you
are
lonely
because
you
are
so
english
so
cold
she
exclaimed
drawing
her
robe
about
her
and
glancing
sideways
toward
the
door
by
which
agapoulos
might
be
expected
to
enter
you
are
bored
yes
of
course
you
look
on
at
life
it
is
not
exciting
that
game
except
for
the
never
once
had
she
looked
at
him
in
the
right
way
for
to
have
done
so
and
to
have
evoked
only
that
amused
yet
compassionate
smile
would
have
meant
hatred
and
zahara
had
been
taught
that
such
hatred
was
fatal
because
it
was
a
confession
of
defeat
i
shall
see
you
again
shall
i
not
he
said
as
she
turned
away
oh
yes
i
shall
be
on
show
i
hope
you
will
she
tossed
her
head
like
a
petulant
child
turned
and
with
never
another
glance
in
his
direction
walked
from
the
room
she
was
very
graceful
he
thought
yet
it
was
not
entirely
of
this
strange
whose
beauty
was
provoking
although
he
resolutely
repelled
her
tentative
advances
that
grantham
was
thinking
in
that
last
gesture
when
she
had
scornfully
tossed
her
head
in
turning
aside
had
lain
a
bitter
memory
grantham
stood
for
a
moment
watching
the
swaying
draperies
then
dropping
the
end
of
his
cigarette
into
a
little
brass
he
took
up
his
hat
gloves
and
cane
from
the
floor
and
walked
toward
the
doorway
through
which
he
had
entered
a
bell
rang
somewhere
and
grantham
paused
a
close
observer
might
have
been
puzzled
by
his
expression
evidently
changing
his
mind
he
crossed
the
room
opened
the
door
and
went
out
leaving
the
house
of
agapoulos
by
a
side
entrance
crossing
the
little
courtyard
below
he
hurried
in
the
direction
of
the
main
street
seeming
to
doubt
the
shadows
which
dusk
was
painting
in
the
narrow
ways
many
men
who
know
chinatown
distrust
its
shadows
but
the
furtive
fear
of
which
grantham
had
become
aware
was
due
not
to
anticipation
but
to
memory
to
a
memory
conjured
up
by
that
gesture
of
zahara
there
were
few
people
in
london
or
elsewhere
who
knew
the
history
of
this
scallywag
englishman
that
he
had
held
the
king
commission
at
some
time
was
generally
assumed
to
be
the
fact
but
that
his
real
name
was
not
grantham
equally
was
taken
for
granted
his
continuing
nevertheless
to
style
himself
major
was
sufficient
evidence
to
those
interested
that
grantham
lived
by
his
wits
and
from
the
fact
that
he
lived
well
and
dressed
well
one
might
have
deduced
that
his
wits
were
bright
if
his
morals
were
turbid
now
the
gesture
of
a
woman
piqued
had
called
up
the
deathless
past
hurrying
through
nearly
empty
squalid
streets
he
found
himself
longing
to
pronounce
a
name
to
hear
it
spoken
that
he
might
linger
over
its
bitter
sweetness
to
this
longing
he
presently
succumbed
and
inez
he
whispered
and
again
more
loudly
such
a
wave
of
lonely
wretchedness
and
remorse
swept
up
about
his
heart
that
he
was
almost
overwhelmed
by
it
yet
he
resigned
himself
to
its
ruthless
cruelty
with
a
sort
of
savage
joy
the
shadowed
ways
of
limehouse
ceased
to
exist
for
him
and
in
spirit
he
stood
once
more
in
a
queer
climbing
sunbathed
street
of
gibraltar
looking
out
across
that
blue
ribbon
of
the
straits
to
where
the
african
coast
lay
hidden
in
the
haze
i
never
knew
he
said
aloud
and
one
meeting
this
man
who
hurried
along
and
muttered
to
himself
must
have
supposed
him
to
be
mad
i
never
knew
oh
god
if
i
had
only
but
he
was
one
of
those
to
whom
knowledge
comes
as
a
bitter
aftermath
when
his
regiment
had
received
orders
to
move
from
the
rock
and
he
had
informed
inez
of
his
departure
she
had
turned
aside
just
as
zahara
had
done
scornfully
and
in
silence
because
of
his
disbelief
in
her
he
had
guarded
his
heart
against
this
beautiful
spanish
girl
who
as
he
realized
too
late
had
brought
him
the
only
real
happiness
he
had
ever
known
often
she
had
told
him
of
her
brother
miguel
who
would
kill
her
would
kill
them
both
if
he
so
much
as
suspected
their
meetings
of
her
affianced
husband
absent
in
tunis
whose
jealousy
knew
no
bounds
he
had
pretended
to
believe
had
even
wanted
to
believe
but
the
witchery
of
the
girl
presence
removed
he
had
laughed
at
himself
and
at
inez
she
was
playing
the
great
game
skilfully
exquisitely
when
he
was
gone
there
would
soon
be
someone
else
yet
he
had
never
told
her
that
he
doubted
he
had
promised
many
things
and
had
left
her
she
died
by
her
own
hand
on
the
night
of
his
departure
now
as
a
wandering
taxi
came
into
view
inez
he
moaned
i
never
that
brother
whom
he
had
counted
a
myth
had
succeeded
in
getting
on
board
the
transport
before
grantham
inner
vision
the
whole
dreadful
scene
now
was
reenacted
the
struggle
in
the
stateroom
he
even
seemed
to
hear
the
sound
of
the
shot
to
see
the
spaniard
drenched
with
blood
from
a
wound
in
his
forehead
to
hear
his
cry
i
can
not
see
i
can
not
see
mother
of
mercy
i
have
lost
my
sight
it
had
broken
grantham
the
scandal
was
hushed
up
but
retirement
was
inevitable
he
knew
too
that
the
light
had
gone
out
of
the
world
for
him
as
it
had
gone
for
miguel
da
mura
it
is
sometimes
thus
that
a
scallywag
is
made
iv
the
star
of
egypt
as
grantham
went
out
by
the
side
door
hassan
soft
of
foot
appeared
crossing
to
the
main
door
he
opened
it
and
walked
down
the
narrow
corridor
beyond
presently
came
the
tap
tap
tap
of
a
stick
and
a
sound
of
muttered
conversation
in
some
place
below
hassan
reentered
and
went
in
through
the
curtained
doorway
to
summon
agapoulos
agapoulos
was
dressing
and
would
not
be
disturbed
hassan
went
back
to
those
who
waited
but
ere
long
returned
again
chattering
volubly
to
himself
going
behind
the
carven
screen
he
rapped
upon
the
door
of
zahara
room
and
she
directed
him
to
come
in
to
zahara
hassan
was
no
more
than
a
piece
of
furniture
and
she
thought
as
little
of
his
intruding
while
she
was
in
the
midst
of
her
toilet
as
another
woman
would
have
thought
of
the
entrance
of
a
maid
two
men
reported
hassan
who
wo
go
away
until
they
see
whom
do
they
want
to
see
she
inquired
indifferently
adjusting
the
line
of
her
eyebrow
with
an
artistically
pointed
pencil
they
say
whoever
belongs
zahara
invariably
spoke
either
french
or
english
to
natives
and
if
hassan
had
addressed
her
in
arabic
she
would
not
have
replied
although
she
spoke
that
language
better
than
she
spoke
any
other
what
are
they
like
not
police
foreign
replied
hassan
vaguely
english
american
no
not
american
or
english
very
black
hair
dark
zahara
a
student
of
men
became
aware
of
a
mild
interest
these
swarthy
visitors
should
prove
an
agreeable
antidote
to
the
poisonous
calm
of
harry
grantham
she
was
trying
with
all
the
strength
of
her
strange
stifled
soul
not
to
think
of
grantham
and
she
was
incapable
of
recognizing
the
fact
that
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
had
thought
of
little
else
for
a
long
time
past
even
now
it
was
because
of
him
that
she
determined
to
interview
the
foreign
visitors
the
mystery
of
her
emotions
puzzled
her
more
than
ever
she
descended
to
a
small
barely
furnished
room
on
the
ground
floor
close
beside
the
door
opening
upon
the
street
it
was
lighted
by
one
hanging
lamp
on
the
divan
which
constituted
the
principal
item
of
furniture
a
small
man
slenderly
built
was
sitting
he
wore
a
hat
so
broad
of
brim
that
it
threw
the
whole
of
the
upper
part
of
his
face
into
shadow
it
was
impossible
to
see
his
eyes
beside
him
rested
a
heavy
as
zahara
entered
a
wonderful
gaily
coloured
figure
this
man
did
not
move
in
the
slightest
but
sat
chin
on
breast
his
small
muscular
brown
hands
resting
on
his
knees
his
companion
however
a
person
of
more
massive
build
elegantly
dressed
and
handsome
in
a
swarthy
fashion
bowed
gravely
and
removed
his
hat
zahara
liked
his
eyes
which
were
dark
and
very
bold
looking
m
agapoulos
is
engaged
she
said
speaking
in
french
what
is
it
you
wish
to
know
the
man
regarded
her
fixedly
and
senorita
he
replied
i
will
be
frank
with
save
for
his
use
of
the
word
senorita
he
also
spoke
in
french
zahara
drew
her
robe
more
closely
about
her
and
adopted
her
most
stately
manner
my
name
continued
the
other
does
not
matter
but
my
business
is
to
look
into
the
affairs
of
other
people
you
understand
zahara
who
understood
from
this
that
the
man
was
some
kind
of
inquiry
agent
opened
her
blue
eyes
very
widely
and
at
the
same
time
shook
her
head
no
she
protested
what
do
you
mean
a
certain
gentleman
came
here
a
short
time
ago
came
into
this
house
and
must
be
here
now
do
be
afraid
he
has
done
nothing
very
dreadful
he
added
reassuringly
zahara
retreated
a
step
and
a
little
wrinkle
of
disapproval
appeared
between
her
pencilled
brows
she
no
longer
liked
the
man
eyes
she
decided
they
were
deceitful
eyes
his
companion
had
taken
up
the
heavy
stick
and
was
restlessly
tapping
the
floor
there
is
no
one
here
said
zahara
calmly
except
the
people
who
live
in
the
he
is
here
he
is
here
muttered
the
man
seated
on
the
divan
the
tapping
of
his
stick
had
grown
more
rapid
but
as
he
had
spoken
in
spanish
zahara
who
was
ignorant
of
that
language
had
no
idea
what
he
had
said
my
friend
continued
the
spaniard
bowing
slightly
in
the
direction
of
the
slender
man
who
so
persistently
kept
his
hat
on
his
head
chanced
to
hear
the
voice
of
this
gentleman
as
he
spoke
to
your
porter
on
entering
the
door
and
although
the
door
was
closed
too
soon
for
us
actually
to
see
him
we
are
convinced
that
he
is
the
person
we
i
think
you
are
mistaken
said
zahara
coolly
but
what
do
you
want
him
for
as
she
uttered
the
words
she
realized
that
even
the
memory
of
grantham
was
sufficient
to
cause
her
to
betray
herself
she
had
betrayed
her
interest
to
the
man
himself
and
now
she
had
betrayed
it
to
this
stranger
whose
manner
was
so
mysterious
the
spaniard
recognized
the
fact
and
unlike
grantham
acted
upon
it
promptly
he
has
taken
away
the
wife
of
another
senorita
he
said
simply
and
watched
her
as
he
spoke
the
lie
she
listened
in
silence
her
lower
lip
twitched
and
she
bit
it
fiercely
he
went
first
to
port
said
and
then
came
to
london
with
this
woman
continued
the
spaniard
remorselessly
we
come
from
her
husband
to
ask
her
to
return
yes
he
will
forgive
her
or
he
offers
her
rapidly
but
comprehensively
the
speaker
bold
glance
travelled
over
zahara
from
her
golden
head
to
her
tiny
embroidered
shoes
if
you
can
help
us
in
this
matter
it
will
be
worth
fifty
english
pounds
to
you
he
concluded
zahara
was
breathing
rapidly
the
fatal
hatred
which
she
had
sought
to
stifle
gained
a
new
vitality
another
woman
another
woman
actually
here
in
london
so
there
was
someone
upon
whom
he
did
not
look
in
that
and
manner
how
she
hated
him
how
she
hated
the
woman
to
whom
he
had
but
a
moment
ago
returned
then
he
will
marry
this
other
one
she
said
suddenly
oh
no
already
he
neglects
her
we
think
she
will
go
zahara
experienced
a
swift
change
of
sentiment
she
seemed
to
be
compounded
of
two
separate
persons
one
of
whom
laughed
cruelly
at
the
folly
of
the
other
what
is
the
name
of
this
man
you
think
your
friend
has
recognized
she
asked
the
big
stick
was
rapping
furiously
during
this
colloquy
we
are
both
sure
senorita
his
name
is
major
that
spalding
and
grantham
were
neighbouring
towns
in
lincolnshire
zahara
did
not
know
but
no
one
of
that
name
comes
here
she
replied
the
one
you
heard
and
who
has
gone
is
not
called
by
that
she
spoke
with
forced
calm
it
was
grantham
they
sought
but
what
happens
if
i
show
you
this
one
who
is
not
called
spalding
no
matter
point
him
out
to
me
answered
the
spaniard
eagerly
and
his
dark
eyes
seemed
to
be
on
fire
point
him
out
to
me
and
fifty
pounds
of
english
money
is
yours
let
me
he
drew
out
a
wallet
and
held
up
a
number
of
notes
fifty
he
said
in
a
subdued
voice
when
you
point
him
for
a
long
moment
zahara
hesitated
then
sixty
she
corrected
him
now
then
i
will
do
it
if
you
tell
what
exhibiting
a
sort
of
eager
impatience
the
man
displayed
a
bunch
of
documents
i
give
him
these
he
explained
and
my
work
is
h
said
zahara
he
must
not
know
that
it
is
i
who
have
shown
him
to
you
he
will
be
here
at
nine
and
i
shall
dance
you
understand
then
said
the
spaniard
eagerly
this
is
what
you
will
and
speaking
close
to
her
ear
he
rapidly
outlined
a
plan
but
presently
she
interrupted
him
pooh
it
is
spanish
the
rose
i
dance
the
dances
of
but
he
persisted
it
will
not
awhile
longer
they
talked
the
rapping
of
the
stick
upon
the
tiled
floor
growing
ever
faster
and
faster
but
finally
i
will
tell
hassan
that
you
are
to
be
admitted
said
zahara
and
she
held
out
her
hand
for
the
notes
when
presently
the
visitors
departed
she
learned
that
the
smaller
man
was
blind
for
his
companion
led
him
out
of
the
room
and
out
of
the
house
she
stood
awhile
listening
to
the
tap
tap
tap
of
the
heavy
stick
receding
along
the
street
what
she
did
not
hear
and
could
not
have
understood
had
she
heard
since
it
was
uttered
in
spanish
was
the
cry
of
exultant
hatred
which
came
from
the
lips
of
the
taller
man
at
last
miguel
at
last
though
blind
you
have
found
him
you
have
not
failed
i
shall
not
fail
zahara
peeped
through
the
carved
screen
at
the
assembled
company
they
were
smoking
and
drinking
and
seemed
to
be
in
high
good
humour
safiyeh
had
danced
and
they
had
applauded
the
performance
but
had
complained
to
agapoulos
that
they
had
seen
scores
of
such
dances
and
dancers
safiyeh
who
had
very
little
english
had
not
understood
this
and
because
presently
she
was
to
play
upon
the
while
zahara
danced
the
dance
of
the
veils
zahara
had
avoided
informing
her
of
the
verdict
of
the
company
now
as
she
peeped
through
the
lattice
in
the
screen
she
could
see
the
greek
haggling
with
grantham
and
a
tall
man
whom
she
supposed
to
be
sir
horace
tipton
they
were
debating
the
additional
fees
to
be
paid
if
zahara
the
star
of
egypt
was
to
present
the
secret
and
wonderful
dance
of
which
all
men
had
heard
but
which
only
a
true
daughter
of
the
ancient
tribe
of
the
ghawazi
could
perform
sometimes
zahara
was
proud
of
her
descent
from
a
of
kenneh
this
was
always
at
night
when
a
sort
of
barbaric
excitement
possessed
her
which
came
from
the
blood
of
her
mother
then
a
new
light
entered
her
eyes
and
they
seemed
to
grow
long
and
languid
and
dark
so
that
no
one
would
have
suspected
that
in
daylight
they
were
blue
a
wild
pagan
abandon
claimed
her
and
she
seemed
to
hear
the
wailing
of
reed
instruments
and
the
throb
of
the
ancient
drums
which
were
played
of
old
before
the
kings
of
egypt
safiyeh
was
not
a
true
dancing
girl
and
because
she
knew
none
of
those
fine
frenzies
she
danced
without
inspiration
like
a
brown
puppet
moved
by
strings
but
she
could
play
upon
an
much
better
than
zahara
and
therefore
must
not
be
upset
until
she
had
played
for
the
dance
of
the
veils
seeing
that
the
bargain
was
all
but
concluded
zahara
stole
back
to
her
room
her
lightly
clad
body
gleamed
like
that
of
some
statue
become
animate
her
cheeks
flushed
as
she
took
up
the
veils
of
which
she
alone
knew
the
symbolic
meaning
the
white
veil
the
purple
veil
each
had
its
story
to
tell
her
and
the
veil
of
burning
scarlet
in
a
corner
of
the
big
room
on
a
divan
near
the
door
she
had
seen
the
spaniard
a
handsome
swarthy
figure
in
his
dress
clothes
and
now
opening
a
drawer
she
glanced
at
the
little
pile
of
notes
which
represented
her
share
of
the
bargain
there
were
fifty
she
had
told
agapoulos
that
a
distinguished
foreigner
with
an
introduction
from
someone
she
knew
had
paid
ten
pounds
to
be
present
and
because
she
had
given
agapoulos
the
ten
pounds
agapoulos
had
agreed
to
admit
the
visitor
she
could
hear
the
greek
approaching
now
but
she
was
thinking
of
grantham
whom
she
had
last
seen
in
laughing
conversation
with
the
tall
man
his
laughter
had
appeared
forced
doubtless
he
grew
weary
of
the
woman
he
had
brought
to
london
dance
with
all
the
devil
that
is
in
you
my
beautiful
said
agapoulos
hurrying
into
the
room
zahara
turned
aside
toying
with
the
veils
they
are
rich
eh
she
said
indifferently
she
was
thinking
of
the
fifty
pounds
which
she
had
earned
so
easily
and
after
all
how
strangely
her
mind
wandered
perhaps
he
was
really
tired
of
the
woman
the
spaniard
had
said
so
very
rich
murmured
agapoulos
complacently
he
brushed
his
moustache
and
rattled
keys
in
his
pocket
in
his
dress
clothes
he
looked
like
the
manager
of
a
prosperous
picture
palace
safryeh
he
called
when
presently
the
music
commenced
the
players
concealed
behind
the
tall
screen
an
expectant
hush
fell
upon
the
company
hassan
who
played
the
darabukkeh
could
modulate
its
throbbing
so
wonderfully
zahara
entered
the
room
enveloped
from
shoulders
to
ankles
in
a
cloak
between
her
lips
she
held
a
red
rose
by
god
what
a
beauty
said
a
husky
voice
zahara
did
not
know
which
of
the
party
had
spoken
but
she
was
conscious
of
the
fact
that
by
virtue
of
the
strange
witchcraft
which
became
hers
on
such
nights
she
held
them
all
they
were
her
slaves
slowly
she
walked
across
the
apartment
while
the
throbbing
of
the
arab
drum
grew
softer
and
softer
producing
a
weird
effect
of
space
and
distance
all
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
and
meeting
grantham
gaze
she
saw
at
last
the
light
there
which
she
knew
this
sudden
knowledge
of
triumph
almost
unnerved
her
and
the
rose
which
she
had
taken
from
between
her
lips
trembled
in
her
white
fingers
two
of
the
petals
fell
upon
the
carpet
which
was
from
the
looms
of
ispahan
like
blood
spots
the
petals
lay
upon
the
cream
surface
zahara
swung
sharply
about
agapoulos
seated
alone
in
the
chair
over
which
he
had
draped
the
leopard
skin
was
busily
brushing
his
moustache
and
glancing
sideways
toward
the
screen
which
concealed
safryeh
zahara
tilted
her
head
on
to
her
shoulder
and
cast
a
languorous
glance
into
the
shadows
masking
the
watchful
spaniard
she
could
see
his
eyes
gleaming
like
those
of
a
wild
beast
an
icy
finger
seemed
to
touch
her
heart
he
had
lied
to
her
she
knew
it
suddenly
intuitively
well
she
would
see
she
also
had
guile
with
a
little
scornful
laugh
zahara
tossed
the
rose
on
to
the
knees
of
agapoulos
the
sound
of
three
revolver
shots
fired
in
quick
succession
rang
out
above
the
throbbing
music
agapoulos
clutched
at
his
shirt
front
with
both
hands
uttered
a
stifled
scream
and
tried
to
stand
up
he
coughed
and
glaring
straight
in
front
of
him
fell
forward
across
a
little
coffee
table
laden
with
champagne
bottles
and
glasses
coincident
with
the
crash
made
by
his
falling
body
came
the
loud
bang
of
a
door
the
spaniard
had
gone
by
god
sir
it
murder
it
murder
cried
the
same
husky
voice
which
had
commented
upon
the
beauty
of
zahara
there
was
a
mingling
purposeless
movement
someone
ran
to
the
door
to
find
that
it
was
locked
from
the
outside
eddie
now
recognizable
by
his
accent
came
toward
the
prone
man
dazed
horrified
and
grown
very
white
zahara
a
beautiful
tragic
figure
in
her
flaming
cloak
stood
looking
down
at
the
dead
man
safiyeh
was
peeping
round
from
behind
the
screen
her
face
a
brown
mask
of
terror
hassan
holding
his
drum
appeared
behind
her
staring
stupidly
to
the
smell
of
cigar
smoke
and
perfume
a
new
and
acrid
odour
was
added
vaguely
the
truth
was
stealing
in
upon
the
mind
of
the
that
she
had
been
made
party
to
a
plot
to
murder
grantham
she
had
saved
his
life
he
belonged
to
her
now
she
could
hear
him
speaking
although
for
some
reason
she
could
not
see
him
a
haze
had
come
blotting
out
everything
but
the
still
ungainly
figure
which
lay
so
near
her
upon
the
carpet
one
clutching
fat
hand
upon
which
a
diamond
glittered
outstretched
so
that
it
nearly
touched
her
bare
white
feet
we
must
get
out
this
way
the
side
door
to
the
courtyard
none
of
us
can
afford
to
be
mixed
up
in
an
affair
of
this
there
was
more
confused
movement
and
a
buzz
of
excited
voices
meaningless
chaotic
zahara
could
feel
the
draught
from
the
newly
opened
door
a
thin
stream
of
blood
was
stealing
across
the
carpet
it
had
almost
reached
the
fallen
rose
petals
which
it
strangely
resembled
in
colour
under
the
light
of
the
lanterns
as
though
dispersed
by
the
draught
the
haze
lifted
and
zahara
saw
grantham
standing
by
the
open
doorway
through
which
he
had
ushered
out
the
other
visitors
and
piteous
she
met
his
glance
she
had
seen
that
night
the
look
in
his
eyes
she
had
saved
his
life
and
there
was
much
so
much
that
she
wanted
to
tell
him
a
thousand
yearnings
inexplicable
hitherto
unknown
deep
mysteries
of
her
soul
looked
out
of
those
great
eyes
do
think
he
said
tensely
that
i
was
deceived
i
saw
the
trick
with
the
rose
you
are
as
guilty
as
your
villainous
lover
murderess
he
went
out
and
closed
the
door
the
cloak
slowly
slipped
from
zahara
shoulders
and
the
veils
like
falling
petals
began
to
drop
gently
one
by
one
upon
the
carpet
the
hand
of
the
mandarin
quong
i
the
shadow
on
the
curtain
singapore
is
by
no
means
herself
again
declared
jennings
looking
about
the
lounge
of
the
hotel
de
do
you
agree
knox
burton
fixed
his
lazy
stare
upon
the
speaker
do
blame
poor
old
singapore
he
said
there
is
no
spot
in
this
battered
world
that
i
have
succeeded
in
discovering
which
is
not
changed
for
the
matheson
flicked
ash
from
his
cigar
and
smiled
in
that
peculiarly
happy
manner
which
characterizes
a
certain
american
type
and
which
lent
a
boyish
charm
to
his
personality
you
are
a
pair
of
pessimists
he
pronounced
for
some
reason
best
known
to
themselves
jennings
and
knox
have
decided
upon
a
holiday
very
well
why
grumble
you
are
quite
right
doctor
jennings
admitted
when
i
was
on
service
here
in
the
straits
settlements
i
declared
heaven
knows
how
often
that
the
country
would
never
see
me
again
once
i
was
demobbed
yet
here
you
see
i
am
burton
belongs
here
but
here
knox
and
we
are
all
as
fed
up
as
we
can
be
yes
said
burton
slowly
i
may
be
a
bit
tired
of
singapore
it
a
queer
thing
though
that
you
fellows
have
drifted
back
here
again
the
call
of
the
east
is
no
fable
it
a
call
that
one
hears
for
the
conversation
drifted
into
another
channel
and
all
sorts
of
topics
were
discussed
from
racing
to
the
latest
feminine
fashions
from
ballroom
dances
to
the
merits
and
demerits
of
coalition
government
then
suddenly
what
became
of
adderley
asked
jennings
there
were
several
men
in
the
party
who
had
been
cronies
of
ours
during
the
time
that
we
were
stationed
in
singapore
and
at
jennings
words
a
sort
of
hush
seemed
to
fall
on
those
who
had
known
adderley
i
can
not
say
if
jennings
noticed
this
but
it
was
perfectly
evident
to
me
that
matheson
had
perceived
it
for
he
glanced
swiftly
across
in
my
direction
in
an
oddly
significant
way
i
do
know
replied
burton
who
was
an
engineer
he
was
rather
an
unsavoury
sort
of
character
in
some
ways
but
i
heard
that
he
came
to
a
sticky
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
with
curiosity
for
i
myself
had
often
wondered
what
had
become
of
adderley
well
he
was
reported
to
his
or
something
was
he
just
before
the
time
for
his
demobilization
i
do
know
the
particulars
i
thought
perhaps
you
did
as
he
was
in
your
i
have
heard
nothing
whatever
about
it
i
replied
you
mean
sidney
adderley
the
man
who
was
so
indecently
rich
someone
interjected
had
a
place
at
katong
and
was
always
talking
about
his
father
millions
that
the
yes
said
jennings
there
was
some
scandal
i
know
but
it
was
after
my
time
something
about
an
old
mandarin
out
johore
bahru
way
was
it
not
asked
burton
the
last
thing
i
heard
about
adderley
was
that
he
had
nobody
would
have
cared
much
if
he
had
declared
jennings
i
know
of
several
who
would
have
been
jolly
glad
there
was
a
lot
of
the
brute
about
adderley
apart
from
the
fact
that
he
had
more
money
than
was
good
for
him
his
culture
was
a
veneer
it
was
his
that
spoke
all
the
everybody
would
have
forgiven
adderley
his
vulgarity
said
matheson
quietly
if
the
man
heart
had
been
in
the
right
surely
an
instance
of
trying
to
make
a
silk
purse
out
of
a
sow
ear
someone
murmured
burton
gazed
rather
hard
at
the
last
speaker
so
far
as
i
am
aware
he
said
the
poor
devil
is
dead
so
go
are
you
sure
he
is
dead
asked
matheson
glancing
at
burton
in
that
quizzical
amused
way
of
his
no
i
am
not
sure
i
am
merely
speaking
from
hearsay
and
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
the
information
was
rather
vague
but
i
gathered
that
he
had
vanished
at
any
rate
and
remembering
certain
earlier
episodes
in
his
career
i
was
led
to
suppose
that
this
vanishing
meant
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
significantly
you
mean
the
old
mandarin
suggested
matheson
was
there
really
anything
in
that
story
or
was
it
suggested
by
the
unpleasant
reputation
of
adderley
jennings
asked
i
can
settle
any
doubts
upon
that
point
said
i
whereupon
i
immediately
became
a
focus
of
general
attention
what
were
you
ever
at
that
place
of
adderley
at
katong
asked
jennings
with
intense
curiosity
i
nodded
lighting
a
fresh
cigarette
in
a
manner
that
may
have
been
unduly
leisurely
did
you
see
her
again
i
nodded
really
i
must
have
been
peculiarly
favoured
but
certainly
i
had
that
you
speak
of
seeing
her
said
one
of
the
party
now
entering
the
conversation
for
the
first
time
to
whom
do
you
refer
well
replied
burton
it
really
a
sort
of
fairy
tale
unless
knox
glacing
across
in
my
direction
can
confirm
it
but
there
was
a
story
current
during
the
latter
part
of
adderley
stay
in
singapore
to
the
effect
that
he
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
wife
or
some
member
of
the
household
of
an
old
gentleman
out
johore
bahru
way
sort
of
mandarin
or
big
pot
among
the
it
was
rumoured
that
he
had
bolted
with
her
added
another
speaker
i
think
it
was
more
than
a
why
do
you
say
so
well
representations
were
made
to
the
authorities
i
know
for
an
absolute
certainty
and
i
have
an
idea
that
adderley
was
kicked
out
of
the
service
as
a
consequence
of
the
scandal
which
how
is
it
one
never
heard
of
this
money
speaks
my
dear
fellow
cried
burton
even
when
it
is
possessed
by
such
a
peculiar
outsider
as
adderley
the
thing
was
hushed
up
it
was
a
very
nasty
business
but
knox
was
telling
us
that
he
had
actually
seen
the
lady
please
carry
on
knox
for
i
must
admit
that
i
am
intensely
i
can
only
say
that
i
saw
her
on
one
with
adderley
where
at
his
place
at
i
even
thought
his
place
at
that
resort
was
something
of
a
myth
declared
jennings
he
never
asked
me
to
go
there
but
then
i
took
that
as
a
compliment
pardon
the
apparent
innuendo
knox
he
added
laughing
but
you
say
you
actually
visited
the
establishment
yes
i
replied
slowly
i
met
him
here
in
this
very
hotel
one
evening
in
the
winter
of
after
the
natives
attempt
to
mutiny
he
had
been
drinking
rather
heavily
a
fact
which
he
was
quite
unable
to
disguise
he
was
never
by
any
means
a
real
friend
of
mine
in
fact
i
doubt
that
he
had
a
true
friend
in
the
world
anyhow
i
could
see
that
he
was
lonely
and
as
i
chanced
to
be
at
a
loose
end
i
accepted
an
invitation
to
go
over
to
what
he
termed
his
place
at
katong
his
little
place
proved
to
be
a
veritable
palace
the
man
privately
or
rather
secretly
to
be
exact
kept
up
a
sort
of
pagan
state
he
had
any
number
of
servants
of
course
he
became
practically
a
millionaire
after
the
death
of
his
father
as
you
will
remember
and
given
more
congenial
company
i
must
confess
that
i
might
have
spent
a
most
enjoyable
evening
there
adderley
insisted
upon
priming
me
with
champagne
and
after
a
while
i
may
as
well
admit
that
i
lost
something
of
my
former
reserve
and
began
in
a
fashion
to
feel
that
i
was
having
a
fairly
good
time
by
the
way
my
host
was
not
quite
frankly
drunk
he
got
into
that
objectionable
and
dangerous
mood
which
some
of
you
will
recall
and
i
could
see
by
the
light
in
his
eyes
that
there
was
mischief
brewing
although
at
the
time
i
did
not
know
its
nature
i
should
explain
that
we
were
amusing
ourselves
in
a
room
which
was
nearly
as
large
as
the
lounge
of
this
hotel
and
furnished
in
a
somewhat
similar
manner
there
were
carved
pillars
and
stained
glass
domes
a
little
fountain
and
all
those
other
peculiarities
of
an
eastern
household
presently
adderley
gave
an
order
to
one
of
his
servants
and
glanced
at
me
with
that
sort
of
mocking
look
in
his
eyes
which
i
loathed
which
everybody
loathed
who
ever
met
the
man
of
course
i
had
no
idea
what
all
this
portended
but
i
was
very
shortly
to
learn
while
he
was
still
looking
at
me
but
stealing
at
a
doorway
before
which
was
draped
a
most
wonderful
curtain
of
a
sort
of
flamingo
colour
this
curtain
was
suddenly
pulled
aside
and
a
girl
came
in
of
course
you
must
remember
that
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
speaking
the
scandal
respecting
the
mandarin
had
not
yet
come
to
light
consequently
i
had
no
idea
who
the
girl
could
be
i
saw
she
was
a
eurasian
but
of
her
striking
beauty
there
could
be
no
doubt
whatever
she
was
dressed
in
magnificent
robes
and
she
literally
glittered
with
jewels
she
even
wore
jewels
upon
the
toes
of
her
little
bare
feet
but
the
first
thing
that
struck
me
at
the
moment
of
her
appearance
was
that
her
presence
there
was
contrary
to
her
wishes
and
inclinations
i
have
never
seen
a
similar
expression
in
any
woman
eyes
she
looked
at
adderley
as
though
she
would
gladly
have
slain
him
seeing
this
look
his
mocking
smile
in
which
there
was
something
of
triumph
of
the
joy
of
possession
turned
to
a
scowl
of
positive
brutality
he
clenched
his
fists
in
a
way
that
set
me
bristling
he
advanced
toward
the
girl
and
although
the
width
of
the
room
divided
them
she
recoiled
and
the
significance
of
expression
and
gesture
was
unmistakable
adderley
paused
you
have
made
up
your
mind
to
dance
after
all
he
shouted
the
look
in
the
girl
dark
eyes
was
pitiful
and
she
turned
to
me
with
a
glance
of
dumb
entreaty
no
she
cried
no
why
do
you
bring
me
here
roared
adderley
that
what
i
want
you
to
do
rebellion
leapt
again
to
the
wonderful
eyes
and
she
started
back
with
a
perfectly
splendid
gesture
of
defiance
at
that
my
brutal
and
drunken
host
leapt
in
her
direction
i
was
on
my
feet
now
but
before
i
could
act
the
girl
said
a
thing
which
checked
him
sobered
him
which
pulled
him
up
short
as
though
he
had
encountered
a
stone
wall
god
she
said
she
was
speaking
of
course
in
her
native
tongue
hand
his
hand
look
his
hand
to
me
her
words
were
meaningless
naturally
but
following
the
direction
of
her
positively
agonized
glance
i
saw
that
she
was
watching
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
shadow
of
someone
moving
behind
the
curtain
which
produced
an
effect
not
unlike
that
of
a
huge
outstretched
hand
the
fingers
crooked
knox
whispered
adderley
grasping
me
by
the
shoulder
he
pointed
with
a
quivering
finger
toward
this
indistinct
shadow
upon
the
curtain
and
you
see
it
do
you
see
it
he
said
huskily
is
his
hand
it
is
his
hand
of
the
pair
i
think
the
man
was
the
more
frightened
but
the
girl
uttering
a
frightful
shriek
ran
out
of
the
room
as
though
pursued
by
a
demon
as
she
did
so
whoever
had
been
moving
behind
the
curtain
evidently
went
away
the
shadow
disappeared
and
adderley
still
staring
as
if
hypnotized
at
the
spot
where
it
had
been
continued
to
hold
my
shoulder
as
in
a
vise
then
sinking
down
upon
a
heap
of
cushions
beside
me
he
loudly
and
shakily
ordered
more
champagne
utterly
mystified
by
the
incident
i
finally
left
him
in
a
state
of
stupor
and
returned
to
my
quarters
wondering
whether
i
had
dreamed
half
of
the
episode
or
the
whole
of
it
whether
he
did
really
possess
that
wonderful
palace
or
whether
he
had
borrowed
it
to
impress
i
ceased
speaking
and
my
story
was
received
in
absolute
silence
until
and
that
is
all
you
know
said
burton
absolutely
all
i
had
to
leave
about
that
time
you
remember
and
afterward
went
to
yes
i
remember
it
was
while
you
were
away
that
the
scandal
arose
respecting
the
mandarin
extraordinary
story
knox
i
should
like
to
know
what
it
all
meant
and
what
the
end
of
it
matheson
broke
his
long
silence
although
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
enlighten
you
respecting
the
end
of
the
story
he
said
quietly
perhaps
i
can
carry
it
a
step
really
doctor
what
do
you
know
about
the
matter
i
accidentally
became
implicated
as
follows
replied
the
american
i
was
as
you
know
doing
voluntary
surgical
work
near
singapore
at
the
time
and
one
evening
presumably
about
the
same
period
of
which
knox
is
speaking
i
was
returning
from
the
hospital
at
katong
at
which
i
acted
sometimes
as
anaesthetist
to
my
quarters
in
singapore
just
drifting
along
leisurely
by
the
edge
of
the
gardens
admiring
the
beauty
of
the
mangroves
and
the
deceitful
peace
of
the
eastern
night
the
hour
was
fairly
late
and
not
a
soul
was
about
nothing
disturbed
the
silence
except
those
vague
sibilant
sounds
which
are
so
characteristic
of
the
country
presently
as
i
rambled
on
with
my
thoughts
wandering
back
to
the
dim
ages
i
literally
fell
over
a
man
who
lay
in
the
road
i
was
naturally
startled
but
i
carried
an
electric
pocket
torch
and
by
its
light
i
discovered
that
the
person
over
whom
i
had
fallen
was
a
chinaman
somewhat
past
middle
age
his
clothes
which
were
of
good
quality
were
covered
with
dirt
and
blood
and
he
bore
all
the
appearance
of
having
recently
been
engaged
in
a
very
tough
struggle
his
face
was
notable
only
for
its
possession
of
an
unusually
long
moustache
he
had
swooned
from
loss
of
why
was
he
wounded
exclaimed
jennings
his
hand
had
been
nearly
severed
from
his
wrist
merciful
heavens
i
realized
the
impossibility
of
carrying
him
so
far
as
the
hospital
and
accordingly
i
extemporized
a
rough
tourniquet
and
left
him
under
a
palm
tree
by
the
road
until
i
obtained
assistance
later
at
the
hospital
following
a
consultation
we
found
it
necessary
to
i
should
say
he
objected
fiercely
he
was
past
objecting
to
anything
otherwise
i
have
no
doubt
he
would
have
objected
furiously
the
index
finger
of
the
injured
hand
had
one
of
those
preternaturally
long
nails
protected
by
an
engraved
golden
case
however
at
least
i
gave
him
a
chance
of
life
he
was
under
my
care
for
some
time
but
i
doubt
if
ever
he
was
properly
grateful
he
had
an
iron
constitution
though
and
i
finally
allowed
him
to
depart
one
queer
stipulation
he
had
made
that
the
severed
hand
with
its
golden
should
be
given
to
him
when
he
left
hospital
and
this
bargain
i
faithfully
carried
most
extraordinary
i
said
did
you
ever
learn
the
identity
of
the
old
gentleman
he
was
very
reticent
but
i
made
a
number
of
inquiries
and
finally
learned
with
absolute
certainty
i
think
that
he
was
the
mandarin
quong
mi
su
from
johore
bahru
a
person
of
great
repute
among
the
chinese
there
and
rather
a
big
man
in
china
he
was
known
locally
as
the
mandarin
did
you
learn
anything
respecting
how
he
had
come
by
his
injury
doctor
matheson
smiled
in
his
quiet
fashion
and
selected
a
fresh
cigar
with
great
deliberation
then
i
suppose
it
is
scarcely
a
case
of
betraying
a
professional
secret
he
said
but
during
the
time
that
my
patient
was
recovering
from
the
effects
of
the
anaesthetic
he
unconsciously
gave
me
several
clues
to
the
nature
of
the
episode
putting
two
and
two
together
i
gathered
that
someone
although
the
name
of
this
person
never
once
passed
the
lips
of
the
mandarin
had
abducted
his
favourite
good
heavens
truly
amazing
i
exclaimed
is
it
not
how
small
a
place
the
world
is
my
old
mandarin
had
traced
the
abductor
and
presumably
the
girl
to
some
house
which
i
gathered
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
of
katong
in
an
attempt
to
force
an
entrance
doubtless
with
the
amiable
purpose
of
slaying
them
both
he
had
been
detected
by
the
prime
object
of
his
hatred
in
hurriedly
descending
from
a
window
he
had
been
attacked
by
some
weapon
possibly
a
sword
and
had
only
made
good
his
escape
in
the
condition
in
which
i
found
him
how
far
he
had
proceeded
i
can
not
say
but
i
should
imagine
that
the
house
to
which
he
had
been
was
no
great
distance
from
the
spot
where
i
found
comment
is
really
superfluous
remarked
burton
he
was
looking
for
i
agree
said
jennings
and
i
added
it
was
evidently
after
this
episode
that
i
had
the
privilege
of
visiting
that
interesting
there
was
a
short
interval
of
silence
then
you
probably
retain
no
very
clear
impression
of
the
shadow
which
you
saw
said
matheson
with
great
deliberation
at
the
time
perhaps
you
had
less
occasion
particularly
to
study
it
but
are
you
satisfied
that
it
was
really
caused
by
someone
moving
behind
the
curtain
i
considered
his
question
for
a
few
moments
i
am
not
i
confessed
your
story
doctor
makes
me
wonder
whether
it
may
not
have
been
due
to
something
what
else
can
it
have
been
due
to
exclaimed
jennings
contemptuously
unless
to
the
champagne
i
wo
quote
shakespeare
said
matheson
smiling
in
his
odd
way
the
famous
lines
though
appropriate
are
somewhat
overworked
but
i
will
quote
kipling
is
east
and
west
is

ii
the
lady
of
katong
fully
six
months
had
elapsed
and
on
returning
from
singapore
i
had
forgotten
all
about
adderley
and
the
unsavoury
stories
connected
with
his
reputation
then
one
evening
as
i
was
strolling
aimlessly
along
james
street
wondering
how
i
was
going
to
kill
time
for
almost
everyone
i
knew
was
out
of
town
including
paul
harley
and
london
can
be
infinitely
more
lonely
under
such
conditions
than
any
desert
i
saw
a
figure
approaching
along
the
other
side
of
the
street
the
swing
of
the
shoulders
the
aggressive
turn
of
the
head
were
vaguely
familiar
and
while
i
was
searching
my
memory
and
endeavouring
to
obtain
a
view
of
the
man
face
he
stared
across
in
my
direction
it
was
adderley
he
looked
even
more
debauched
than
i
remembered
him
for
whereas
in
singapore
he
had
had
a
tanned
skin
now
he
looked
unhealthily
pallid
and
blotchy
he
raised
his
hand
and
knox
he
cried
and
ran
across
to
greet
me
his
boisterous
manner
and
a
sort
of
coarse
geniality
which
he
possessed
had
made
him
popular
with
a
certain
set
in
former
days
but
i
who
knew
that
this
geniality
was
forced
and
assumed
to
conceal
a
sort
of
appalling
animalism
had
never
been
deceived
by
it
most
people
found
adderley
out
sooner
or
later
but
i
had
detected
the
man
true
nature
from
the
very
beginning
his
eyes
alone
were
danger
signals
for
any
amateur
psychologist
however
i
greeted
him
civilly
enough
bless
my
soul
you
are
looking
as
fit
as
a
fiddle
he
cried
where
have
you
been
and
what
have
you
been
doing
since
i
saw
you
last
nothing
much
i
replied
beyond
trying
to
settle
down
in
a
reformed
reformed
world
echoed
adderley
more
like
a
ruined
world
it
has
seemed
to
he
laughed
loudly
that
he
had
already
explored
several
bottles
was
palpable
we
were
silent
for
a
while
mentally
weighing
one
another
up
as
it
were
then
are
you
living
in
town
asked
adderley
i
am
staying
at
the
carlton
at
the
moment
i
replied
my
chambers
are
in
the
hands
of
the
decorators
it
awkward
interferes
with
my
work
cried
adderley

it
a
nasty
word
knox
are
you
doing
anything
now
nothing
until
eight
when
i
have
an
come
along
to
my
place
he
suggested
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
or
a
whisky
and
soda
if
you
prefer
probably
i
should
have
refused
but
even
as
he
spoke
i
was
mentally
translated
to
the
lounge
of
the
hotel
de
and
prompted
by
a
very
human
curiosity
i
determined
to
accept
his
invitation
i
wondered
if
fate
had
thrown
an
opportunity
in
my
way
of
learning
the
end
of
the
peculiar
story
which
had
been
related
on
that
occasion
i
accompanied
adderley
to
his
chambers
which
were
within
a
throw
of
the
spot
where
i
had
met
him
that
this
gift
for
making
himself
unpopular
with
all
and
sundry
high
and
low
had
not
deserted
him
was
illustrated
by
the
attitude
of
the
liftman
as
we
entered
the
hall
of
the
chambers
he
was
barely
civil
to
adderley
and
even
regarded
myself
with
marked
disfavour
we
were
admitted
by
adderley
man
whom
i
had
not
seen
before
but
who
was
some
kind
of
foreigner
i
think
a
portuguese
it
was
characteristic
of
adderley
no
englishman
would
ever
serve
him
for
long
and
there
had
been
more
than
one
man
in
his
old
company
who
had
openly
avowed
his
intention
of
dealing
with
adderley
on
the
first
available
occasion
his
chambers
were
ornately
furnished
indeed
the
room
in
which
we
sat
more
closely
resembled
a
scene
from
an
oscar
asche
production
than
a
normal
man
study
there
was
something
unreal
about
it
all
i
have
since
thought
that
this
unreality
extended
to
the
person
of
the
man
himself
grossly
material
he
yet
possessed
an
aura
of
mystery
mystery
of
an
unsavoury
sort
there
was
something
furtive
secretive
about
adderley
entire
mode
of
life
i
had
never
felt
at
ease
in
his
company
and
now
as
i
sat
staring
wonderingly
at
the
strange
and
costly
ornaments
with
which
the
room
was
overladen
i
bethought
me
of
the
object
of
my
visit
how
i
should
have
brought
the
conversation
back
to
our
singapore
days
i
know
not
but
a
suitable
opening
was
presently
offered
by
adderley
himself
do
you
ever
see
any
of
the
old
gang
he
inquired
i
was
in
singapore
about
six
months
ago
i
replied
and
i
met
some
of
them
what
had
they
drifted
back
to
the
east
after
all
two
or
three
of
them
were
taking
what
matheson
described
as
a
busman
at
mention
of
matheson
name
adderley
visibly
started
so
you
know
matheson
he
murmured
i
did
know
you
had
ever
met
plainly
to
hide
his
confusion
he
stood
up
and
crossing
the
room
drew
my
attention
to
a
rather
fine
silver
bowl
of
early
persian
ware
he
was
displaying
its
peculiar
virtues
and
showing
a
certain
acquaintance
with
his
subject
when
he
was
interrupted
a
door
opened
suddenly
and
a
girl
came
in
adderley
put
down
the
bowl
and
turned
rapidly
as
i
rose
from
my
seat
it
was
the
lady
of
katong
i
recognized
her
at
once
although
she
wore
a
very
gown
while
it
did
not
suit
her
dark
good
looks
so
well
as
the
native
dress
which
she
had
worn
at
singapore
yet
it
could
not
conceal
the
fact
that
in
a
barbaric
way
she
was
a
very
beautiful
woman
on
finding
a
visitor
in
the
room
she
became
covered
with
confusion
oh
she
said
speaking
in
hindustani
why
did
you
not
tell
me
there
was
someone
here
adderley
reply
was
characteristically
brutal
get
out
he
said
you
i
turned
to
go
for
i
was
conscious
of
an
intense
desire
to
attack
my
host
but
do
go
knox
do
go
he
cried
i
am
sorry
i
am
damned
sorry
i
he
paused
and
looked
at
me
in
a
queer
sort
of
appealing
way
the
girl
her
big
eyes
widely
open
retreated
again
to
the
door
with
curious
lithe
steps
characteristically
oriental
the
door
regained
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
extended
one
small
hand
in
adderley
direction
i
hate
you
she
said
slowly
hate
you
hate
you
she
went
out
quietly
closing
the
door
behind
her
adderley
turned
to
me
with
an
embarrassed
laugh
i
know
you
think
i
am
a
brute
and
an
outsider
he
said
and
perhaps
i
am
everybody
says
i
am
so
i
suppose
there
must
be
something
in
it
but
if
ever
a
man
paid
for
his
mistakes
i
have
paid
for
mine
knox
good
god
i
have
a
friend
in
the
you
probably
do
deserve
one
i
retorted
i
know
i
do
and
that
the
tragedy
of
it
he
replied
you
may
not
believe
it
knox
i
do
expect
anybody
to
believe
me
but
for
more
than
a
year
i
have
been
walking
on
the
edge
of
hell
do
you
know
where
i
have
been
since
i
saw
you
last
i
shook
my
head
in
answer
i
have
been
half
round
the
world
knox
trying
to
find
you
do
know
where
to
look
for
it
i
said
if
only
you
knew
he
whispered
if
only
you
knew
and
sank
down
upon
the
settee
ruffling
his
hair
with
his
hands
and
looking
the
picture
of
haggard
misery
seeing
that
i
was
still
set
upon
departure
hold
on
a
bit
knox
he
implored
do
go
yet
there
is
something
i
want
to
ask
you
something
very
he
crossed
to
a
sideboard
and
mixed
himself
a
stiff
he
asked
me
to
join
him
but
i
refused
wo
you
sit
down
again
i
shook
my
head
you
came
to
my
place
at
katong
once
he
began
abruptly
i
was
damned
drunk
i
admit
it
but
something
happened
do
you
remember
i
nodded
this
is
what
i
want
to
ask
you
did
you
or
did
you
not
see
that
shadow
i
stared
him
hard
in
the
face
i
remember
the
episode
to
which
you
refer
i
replied
i
certainly
saw
a
but
what
sort
of
shadow
to
me
it
seemed
an
indefinite
shapeless
thing
as
though
caused
by
someone
moving
behind
the
it
did
look
to
you
like
the
shadow
of
a
hand
it
might
have
been
but
i
could
not
be
adderley
groaned
knox
he
said
money
is
a
curse
it
has
been
a
curse
to
me
if
i
have
had
my
fun
god
knows
i
have
paid
for
your
idea
of
fun
is
probably
a
peculiar
one
i
said
dryly
let
me
confess
that
i
was
only
suffering
the
man
society
because
of
an
intense
curiosity
which
now
possessed
me
on
learning
that
the
lady
of
katong
was
still
in
adderley
company
whether
my
repugnance
for
his
society
would
have
enabled
me
to
remain
any
longer
i
can
not
say
but
as
if
fate
had
deliberately
planned
that
i
should
become
a
witness
of
the
concluding
phases
of
this
secret
drama
we
were
now
interrupted
a
second
time
and
again
in
a
dramatic
fashion
adderley
nondescript
valet
came
in
with
letters
and
a
rather
large
brown
paper
parcel
sealed
and
fastened
with
great
care
as
the
man
went
out
surely
that
is
from
singapore
muttered
adderley
taking
up
the
parcel
he
seemed
to
become
temporarily
oblivious
of
my
presence
and
his
face
grew
even
more
haggard
as
he
studied
the
writing
upon
the
wrapper
with
unsteady
fingers
he
untied
it
and
i
lingered
watching
curiously
presently
out
from
the
wrappings
he
took
a
very
beautiful
casket
of
ebony
and
ivory
cunningly
carved
and
standing
upon
four
ivory
legs
what
the
devil
this
he
muttered
he
opened
the
box
which
was
lined
with
and
thereupon
started
back
with
a
great
cry
recoiling
from
the
casket
as
though
it
had
contained
an
adder
my
former
sentiments
forgotten
i
stepped
forward
and
peered
into
the
interior
then
i
in
turn
recoiled
in
the
box
lay
a
shrivelled
yellow
hand
with
long
tapering
and
nails
neatly
severed
at
the
wrist
the
nail
of
the
index
finger
was
enclosed
in
a
tiny
delicately
fashioned
case
of
gold
upon
which
were
engraved
a
number
of
chinese
characters
adderley
sank
down
again
upon
the
settee
my
god
he
whispered
his
hand
his
hand
he
has
sent
me
his
hand
he
began
laughing
whereupon
since
i
could
see
that
the
man
was
practically
hysterical
because
of
his
mysterious
fears
stop
that
i
said
sharply
pull
yourself
together
adderley
what
the
deuce
is
the
matter
with
you
take
it
away
he
moaned
take
it
away
take
the
accursed
thing
away
i
admit
it
is
an
unpleasant
gift
to
send
to
anybody
i
said
but
probably
you
know
more
about
it
than
i
take
it
away
he
repeated
take
it
away
for
god
sake
take
it
away
knox
he
was
quite
beyond
reason
and
therefore
very
well
i
said
and
wrapped
the
casket
in
the
brown
paper
in
which
it
had
come
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
with
it
throw
it
in
the
river
he
answered
burn
it
do
anything
you
like
with
it
but
take
it
out
of
my
sight
iii
the
nail
as
i
descended
to
the
street
the
liftman
regarded
me
in
a
curious
and
rather
significant
way
finally
just
as
i
was
about
to
step
out
into
the
hall
excuse
me
sir
he
said
having
evidently
decided
that
i
was
a
fit
person
to
converse
with
but
are
you
a
friend
of
adderley
why
do
you
ask
well
sir
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
but
at
times
i
have
thought
the
gentleman
was
just
a
little
bit
queer
you
mean
insane
i
asked
sharply
well
sir
i
do
know
but
he
is
always
asking
me
if
i
can
see
shadows
and
things
in
the
lift
and
sometimes
when
he
comes
in
late
of
a
night
he
absolutely
gives
me
the
cold
shivers
he
i
lingered
the
box
under
my
arm
reluctant
to
obtain
confidences
from
a
servant
but
at
the
same
time
keenly
interested
thus
encouraged
then
there
that
lady
friend
of
his
who
is
always
coming
here
the
man
continued
she
haunted
by
shadows
he
paused
watching
me
narrowly
there
nothing
better
in
this
world
than
a
clean
conscience
sir
he
concluded
having
returned
to
my
room
at
the
hotel
i
set
down
the
mysterious
parcel
surveying
it
with
much
disfavour
that
it
contained
the
hand
of
the
mandarin
quong
i
could
not
doubt
the
hand
which
had
been
amputated
by
matheson
its
appearance
in
that
dramatic
fashion
confirmed
matheson
idea
that
the
mandarin
injury
had
been
received
at
the
hands
of
adderley
what
did
all
this
portend
unless
that
the
mandarin
quong
was
dead
and
if
he
were
dead
why
was
adderley
more
afraid
of
him
dead
than
he
had
been
of
him
living
i
thought
of
the
haunting
shadow
i
thought
of
the
night
at
katong
and
i
thought
of
matheson
words
when
he
had
told
us
of
his
discovery
of
the
chinaman
lying
in
the
road
that
night
outside
singapore
i
felt
strangely
disinclined
to
touch
the
relic
and
it
was
only
after
some
moments
hesitation
that
i
undid
the
wrappings
and
raised
the
lid
of
the
casket
dusk
was
very
near
and
i
had
not
yet
lighted
the
lamps
therefore
at
first
i
doubted
the
evidence
of
my
senses
but
having
lighted
up
and
peered
long
and
anxiously
into
the
lining
of
the
casket
i
could
doubt
no
longer
the
casket
was
empty
it
was
like
a
conjuring
trick
that
the
hand
had
been
in
the
box
when
i
had
taken
it
up
from
adderley
table
i
could
have
sworn
before
any
jury
when
and
by
whom
it
had
been
removed
was
a
puzzle
beyond
my
powers
of
unravelling
i
stepped
toward
the
telephone
and
then
remembered
that
paul
harley
was
out
of
london
vaguely
wondering
if
adderley
had
played
me
a
particularly
gruesome
practical
joke
i
put
the
box
on
a
sideboard
and
again
contemplated
the
telephone
doubtfully
far
a
moment
it
was
in
my
mind
to
ring
him
up
finally
taking
all
things
into
consideration
i
determined
that
i
would
have
nothing
further
to
do
with
the
unsavoury
and
mysterious
affairs
it
was
in
vain
however
that
i
endeavoured
to
dismiss
the
matter
from
my
mind
and
throughout
the
evening
which
i
spent
at
a
theatre
with
some
american
friends
i
found
myself
constantly
thinking
of
adderley
and
the
ivory
casket
of
the
mandarin
of
johore
bahru
and
of
the
mystery
of
the
shrivelled
yellow
hand
i
had
been
back
in
my
room
about
half
an
hour
i
suppose
and
it
was
long
past
midnight
when
i
was
startled
by
a
ringing
of
my
telephone
bell
i
took
up
the
receiver
and
knox
knox
came
a
choking
cry
yes
who
is
speaking
it
is
i
adderley
for
god
sake
come
round
to
my
place
at
once
his
words
were
scarcely
intelligible
undoubtedly
he
was
in
the
grip
of
intense
emotion
what
do
you
mean
what
is
the
matter
it
is
here
knox
it
is
here
it
is
knocking
on
the
door
knocking
knocking
you
have
been
drinking
i
said
sternly
where
is
your
man
the
cur
has
bolted
he
bolted
the
moment
he
heard
that
damned
knocking
i
am
all
alone
i
have
no
one
else
to
appeal
there
came
a
choking
sound
then
my
god
knox
it
is
getting
in
i
can
see
the
shadow
on
the
blind
convinced
that
adderley
secret
fears
had
driven
him
mad
i
nevertheless
felt
called
upon
to
attend
to
his
urgent
call
and
without
a
moment
delay
i
hurried
around
to
james
street
the
liftman
was
not
on
duty
the
lower
hall
was
in
darkness
but
i
raced
up
the
stairs
and
found
to
my
astonishment
that
adderley
door
was
wide
open
adderley
i
cried
adderley
there
was
no
reply
and
without
further
ceremony
i
entered
and
searched
the
chambers
they
were
empty
deeply
mystified
i
was
about
to
go
out
again
when
there
came
a
ring
at
the
i
walked
to
the
door
and
a
policeman
was
standing
upon
the
landing
good
evening
sir
he
said
and
then
paused
staring
at
me
curiously
good
evening
constable
i
replied
you
are
not
the
gentleman
who
ran
out
awhile
ago
he
said
a
note
of
suspicion
coming
into
his
voice
i
handed
him
my
card
and
explained
what
had
occurred
then
it
must
have
been
adderley
i
saw
muttered
the
constable
you
saw
when
just
before
you
arrived
sir
he
came
racing
out
into
street
and
dashed
off
like
a
in
which
direction
was
he
going
toward
pall
the
neighbourhood
was
practically
deserted
at
that
hour
but
from
the
guard
on
duty
before
the
palace
we
obtained
our
first
evidence
of
adderley
movements
he
had
raced
by
some
five
minutes
before
frantically
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
and
behaving
like
a
man
flying
for
his
life
no
one
else
had
seen
him
no
one
else
ever
did
see
him
alive
at
two
there
was
no
news
but
i
had
informed
scotland
yard
and
official
inquiries
had
been
set
afoot
nothing
further
came
to
light
that
night
but
as
all
readers
of
the
daily
press
will
remember
adderley
body
was
taken
out
of
the
pond
in
james
park
on
the
following
day
death
was
due
to
drowning
but
his
throat
was
greatly
discoloured
as
though
it
had
been
clutched
in
a
fierce
grip
it
was
i
who
identified
the
body
and
as
many
people
will
know
in
spite
of
the
closest
inquiries
the
mystery
of
adderley
death
has
not
been
properly
cleared
up
to
this
day
the
identity
of
the
lady
who
visited
him
at
his
chambers
was
never
discovered
she
completely
disappeared
the
ebony
and
ivory
casket
lies
on
my
table
at
this
present
moment
visible
evidence
of
an
invisible
menace
from
which
adderley
had
fled
around
the
world
doubtless
the
truth
will
never
be
known
now
a
significant
discovery
however
was
made
some
days
after
the
recovery
of
adderley
body
from
the
bottom
of
the
pond
in
james
park
a
patient
scotland
yard
official
brought
up
the
gold
with
its
mysterious
engravings
and
it
contained
torn
at
the
root
the
incredibly
long
of

the
key
of

i
the
keeper
of
the
key
the
note
of
a
silver
bell
quivered
musically
through
the
scented
air
of
the
madame
de
medici
stirred
slightly
upon
the
divan
with
its
many
silken
cushions
turning
her
head
toward
the
closed
door
with
the
languorous
almost
insolent
indifference
which
one
perceives
in
the
movements
of
a
tigress
below
in
the
lobby
where
the
pillars
of
mokattam
alabaster
upheld
the
painted
roof
the
little
yellow
man
from
pekin
shivered
slightly
although
the
air
was
warm
for
limehouse
and
always
turned
his
mysterious
eyes
toward
a
corner
of
the
great
staircase
which
was
visible
from
where
he
sat
coiled
up
a
lonely
figure
in
the
mushrabiyeh
chair
madame
blew
a
wreath
of
smoke
from
her
lips
and
through
eyes
watched
it
ascend
unbroken
toward
the
canopy
of
which
masked
the
ceiling
a
madonna
by
leonardo
da
vinci
faced
her
across
the
apartment
the
painted
figure
seeming
to
watch
the
living
one
upon
the
divan
madame
smiled
into
the
eyes
of
the
madonna
surely
even
the
great
leonardo
must
have
failed
to
reproduce
that
smile
the
great
leonardo
whose
supreme
art
has
captured
the
smile
of
mona
lisa
madame
had
the
smile
of
cleopatra
which
it
is
said
made
caesar
mad
though
in
repose
the
beauty
of
egypt
queen
left
him
cold
a
robe
of
kashmiri
silk
fine
with
a
phantom
fineness
draped
her
exquisite
shape
as
the
art
of
cellini
draped
the
classic
figures
which
he
wrought
in
gold
and
silver
it
seemed
incorporate
with
her
beauty
a
second
wreath
of
smoke
curled
upward
to
the
canopy
and
madame
watched
this
one
also
through
the
veil
of
her
curved
black
lashes
as
the
eastern
woman
watches
the
world
through
her
veil
those
eyes
were
notable
even
in
so
lovely
a
setting
for
they
were
of
a
hue
rarely
seen
in
human
eyes
being
like
the
eyes
of
a
tigress
yet
they
could
seem
voluptuously
soft
twin
pools
of
liquid
amber
in
whose
depths
a
man
might
lose
his
soul
again
the
silver
bell
sounded
in
the
and
below
the
little
yellow
man
shivered
sympathetically
again
madame
stirred
with
that
high
disdain
that
so
became
her
who
had
the
eyes
of
a
tigress
her
carmine
lips
possessed
the
antique
curve
which
we
are
told
distinguished
the
lips
of
the
comtesse
de
cagliostro
her
cheeks
had
the
freshness
of
flowers
and
her
hair
the
blackness
of
ebony
enhancing
the
miracle
of
her
skin
which
had
the
whiteness
of
ivory
not
of
african
ivory
but
of
that
fossil
ivory
which
has
lain
for
untold
ages
beneath
the
snows
of
siberia
she
dropped
the
cigarette
from
her
tapered
fingers
into
a
little
silver
bowl
upon
a
table
at
her
side
then
lightly
touched
the
bell
which
stood
there
also
its
soft
note
answered
to
the
bell
in
the
a
chinese
servant
silently
descended
the
great
staircase
his
soft
red
slippers
sinking
into
the
rich
pile
of
the
carpet
and
the
little
yellow
man
from
the
great
temple
in
pekin
followed
him
back
up
the
stairway
and
was
ushered
into
the
presence
of
madame
de
medici
the
servant
closed
the
door
silently
and
the
little
yellow
man
fixing
his
eyes
upon
the
beautiful
woman
before
him
fell
upon
his
knees
and
bowed
his
forehead
to
the
carpet
madame
lovely
lips
curved
again
in
the
disdainful
smile
and
she
extended
one
bare
ivory
arm
toward
the
visitor
who
knelt
as
a
suppliant
at
her
feet
rise
my
friend
she
said
in
purest
chinese
which
fell
from
her
lips
with
the
music
of
a
crystal
spring
how
may
i
serve
you
the
yellow
man
rose
and
advanced
a
step
nearer
to
the
divan
but
the
strange
beauty
of
madame
had
spoken
straight
to
his
eastern
heart
had
awakened
his
soul
to
a
new
life
his
glance
travelled
over
the
vision
before
him
from
the
little
persian
slipper
that
peeped
below
the
drapery
of
kashmir
silk
to
the
small
classic
head
with
its
crown
of
ebon
locks
yet
he
dared
not
meet
the
glance
of
the
amber
eyes
sit
here
beside
me
directed
madame
and
she
slightly
changed
her
position
with
that
languorous
and
lithe
grace
suggestive
of
a
creature
of
the
jungle
breathing
rapidly
betwixt
the
importance
of
his
mission
and
a
new
intoxicating
emotion
which
had
come
upon
him
at
the
moment
of
entering
the
perfumed
room
the
yellow
man
obeyed
but
always
with
glance
averted
from
the
taunting
face
of
madame
a
golden
stood
upon
the
floor
over
between
the
high
draped
windows
and
a
faint
pencil
from
its
dying
fires
stole
grayly
upward
upon
the
scented
smoke
the
buddhist
priest
fixed
his
eyes
and
began
with
a
rapidity
that
grew
as
he
proceeded
to
pour
out
his
tale
seated
beside
him
one
round
arm
resting
upon
the
cushions
so
as
almost
to
touch
him
madame
listened
watching
the
averted
yellow
face
and
always
smiling
smiling
the
tale
was
done
at
last
the
was
cold
and
breathlessly
the
buddhist
clutched
his
knees
with
lean
clawish
fingers
and
swayed
to
and
fro
striving
to
conquer
the
emotions
that
whirled
and
fought
within
him
selecting
another
cigarette
from
the
box
beside
her
and
lighting
it
deliberately
madame
de
medici
spoke
my
friend
of
old
she
said
and
of
the
language
of
china
she
made
strange
music
you
come
to
me
from
your
home
in
the
secret
city
because
you
know
that
i
can
serve
you
it
is
she
touched
the
bell
upon
the
table
and
the
servant
reentered
and
bowing
low
held
open
the
door
the
little
yellow
man
first
kneeling
upon
the
carpet
before
the
divan
as
before
an
altar
hurried
from
the
apartment
as
the
door
was
reclosed
and
madame
found
herself
alone
again
she
laughed
lightly
as
calypso
laughed
when
ulysses
ship
appeared
off
the
shores
of
her
isle
god
fashions
few
such
women
it
is
well
ii
the
tiger
lady
by
heavens
annesley
whispered
rene
deacon
what
eyes
that
woman
has
his
companion
following
the
direction
of
deacon
glance
nodded
rather
grimly
the
eyes
of
a
circe
or
at
times
the
eyes
of
a
she
is
magnificent
murmured
deacon
rapturously
i
have
never
seen
so
beautiful
a
his
glance
followed
the
tall
figure
as
it
passed
into
a
smaller
salon
on
the
left
nor
was
he
alone
in
his
regard
fashionable
society
was
well
represented
in
the
gallery
where
a
collection
of
pictures
by
a
celebrated
artist
was
being
shown
and
prior
to
the
entrance
of
the
lady
in
the
strangely
fashioned
cloak
the
somewhat
extraordinary
works
of
art
had
engaged
the
interest
even
of
the
most
fickle
but
from
the
moment
the
made
her
appearance
even
the
most
daring
canvases
were
forgotten
she
wears
shoes
whispered
one
she
is
like
a
design
for
a
poster
laughed
another
i
have
never
seen
anything
so
flashy
in
my
life
was
the
acrid
comment
of
a
third
what
a
dazzlingly
beautiful
woman
remarked
another
this
one
a
man
while
who
is
she
arose
upon
all
sides
judging
from
the
isolation
of
the
barbaric
figure
it
would
seem
that
society
did
not
know
the
but
deacon
seizing
his
companion
by
the
arm
and
almost
dragging
him
into
the
small
salon
which
the
lady
had
entered
turned
in
the
doorway
and
looked
into
annesley
eyes
annesley
palpably
sought
to
evade
the
glance
you
know
everybody
whispered
deacon
you
must
be
acquainted
with
a
great
number
of
people
were
now
thronging
into
the
room
not
so
much
because
of
the
pictures
it
contained
but
rather
out
of
curiosity
respecting
the
beautiful
unknown
annesley
tried
to
withdraw
his
uneasiness
grew
momentarily
greater
i
scarcely
know
her
well
enough
he
protested
to
present
you
moreover
but
she
smiling
at
you
interrupted
deacon
eagerly
his
handsome
but
rather
weak
face
was
flushed
he
was
as
an
old
clubman
had
recently
said
of
him
so
very
he
lacked
the
restraint
usual
in
cultured
englishmen
and
had
the
frankly
passionate
manner
which
one
associates
with
the
south
his
uncle
colonel
deacon
a
mordant
wit
would
say
apologetically
reggie
deacon
father
married
a
gascon
woman
she
was
delightfully
pretty
poor
reggie
certainly
rene
was
impetuous
to
an
embarrassing
degree
nor
lightly
to
be
thwarted
boldly
meeting
the
glance
of
the
woman
of
the
amber
eyes
he
pushed
annesley
forward
not
troubling
to
disguise
his
anxiety
to
be
presented
to
the
she
turned
her
head
languidly
with
that
grace
of
hers
and
unsmiling
now
regarded
annesley
so
you
forget
me
so
soon
annesley
she
murmured
or
is
it
that
you
play
the
good
shepherd
my
dear
madame
said
annesley
recovering
with
an
effort
his
wonted
i
was
merely
endeavouring
to
calm
the
rhapsodies
of
my
friend
who
seemed
disposed
to
throw
himself
at
your
feet
in
he
is
a
very
handsome
boy
murmured
madame
and
as
the
great
eyes
were
turned
upon
deacon
the
carmine
lips
curved
again
in
the
cleopatrian
smile
she
was
indeed
wonderful
for
while
she
spoke
as
the
woman
of
the
world
to
the
boy
there
was
nothing
maternal
in
her
patronage
and
her
eyes
were
twin
flambeaux
luring
luring
and
her
sweet
voice
was
a
song
may
i
beg
leave
to
present
my
friend
rene
deacon
madame
de
medici
said
annesley
and
as
the
two
exchanged
glances
the
a
glance
of
undisguised
passionate
admiration
the
woman
a
glance
unfathomable
he
slightly
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
stood
aside
there
were
others
in
the
salon
who
perceiving
that
the
unknown
beauty
was
acquainted
with
annesley
began
to
move
from
canvas
to
canvas
toward
that
end
of
the
room
where
the
trio
stood
but
madame
did
not
appear
anxious
to
make
new
acquaintances
i
have
seen
quite
enough
of
this
very
entertaining
exhibition
she
said
languidly
toying
with
a
great
unset
emerald
which
swung
by
a
thin
gold
chain
about
her
neck
might
i
entreat
you
to
take
pity
upon
a
very
lonely
woman
and
return
with
me
to
tea
annesley
seemed
on
the
point
of
refusing
when
i
have
acquired
a
reputed
leonardo
continued
madame
and
i
wish
you
to
see
there
was
something
so
like
a
command
in
the
words
that
deacon
stared
at
his
companion
in
frank
surprise
the
latter
avoided
his
glance
and
come
said
madame
de
medici
as
of
old
the
great
catherine
of
her
name
might
have
withdrawn
with
her
suite
so
now
the
lady
of
the
tiger
skins
withdrew
from
the
gallery
the
two
men
following
obediently
and
one
of
them
at
least
a
happy
courtier
iii
twin
pools
of
amber
the
chinese
servant
entered
and
placed
fresh
perfume
upon
the
burning
charcoal
of
the
silver
as
the
scented
smoke
began
to
rise
he
withdrew
and
a
second
servant
entered
who
facially
in
dress
in
figure
and
bearing
was
a
duplicate
of
the
first
this
one
carried
a
large
tray
upon
which
was
set
an
exquisite
porcelain
he
placed
the
tray
upon
a
low
table
beside
the
divan
and
in
turn
withdrew
deacon
seated
in
a
great
ebony
chair
smoked
rapidly
and
nervously
looking
about
the
strangely
appointed
room
with
its
huge
picture
of
the
madonna
its
jade
buddha
surmounting
a
gilded
burmese
cabinet
its
persian
canopy
and
egyptian
divan
at
the
thousand
and
one
costly
curiosities
which
it
displayed
at
this
mingling
of
east
and
west
of
christianity
and
paganism
with
a
growing
wonder
to
one
of
his
blood
there
was
delight
intoxication
in
that
room
but
something
of
apprehension
too
now
grew
up
within
him
madame
de
medici
entered
the
garish
was
discarded
now
and
her
supple
figure
was
seen
to
best
advantage
in
one
of
those
dark
silken
gowns
which
she
affected
and
which
had
a
seeming
of
the
because
they
defied
fashion
she
held
in
her
hand
an
orchid
its
structure
that
of
an
odontoglossum
but
of
a
delicate
green
colour
heavily
splashed
with
scarlet
a
weird
and
bloom
just
within
the
doorway
she
paused
as
deacon
leaped
up
and
looked
at
him
through
the
veil
of
the
curved
lashes
for
you
she
said
twirling
the
blossom
between
her
fingers
and
gliding
toward
him
with
her
tigerish
step
he
spoke
no
word
but
face
flushed
sought
to
look
into
her
eyes
as
she
pinned
the
orchid
in
the
of
his
coat
her
hands
were
flawless
in
shape
and
colouring
being
beautiful
as
the
sculptured
hands
preserved
in
the
works
of
phidias
the
slight
draught
occasioned
by
the
opening
of
the
door
caused
the
smoke
from
the
to
be
wafted
toward
the
centre
of
the
room
like
a
phantom
it
coiled
about
the
two
standing
there
upon
a
red
and
gold
bedouin
rug
and
the
heavy
perfume
or
the
close
proximity
of
this
singularly
lovely
woman
wrought
upon
the
sensibilities
of
deacon
to
such
an
extent
that
he
was
conscious
of
a
growing
faintness
ah
you
are
not
well
exclaimed
madame
with
deep
concern
it
is
the
perfume
which
that
foolish
ah
li
has
lighted
he
forgets
that
we
are
in
not
at
all
protested
deacon
faintly
and
conscious
that
he
was
making
a
fool
of
himself
i
think
i
have
perhaps
been
overdoing
it
rather
of
late
forgive
me
if
i
sit
he
sank
on
the
cushioned
divan
his
heart
beating
furiously
while
madame
touched
the
little
bell
whereupon
one
of
the
servants
entered
she
spoke
in
chinese
pointing
to
the
ah
li
bowed
and
removed
the
censer
as
the
door
softly
reclosed
you
are
better
she
whispered
sweetly
solicitous
and
seating
herself
beside
deacon
she
laid
her
hand
lightly
upon
his
arm
quite
he
replied
hoarsely
please
do
not
worry
about
me
i
am
wondering
what
has
become
of
ah
the
poor
man
exclaimed
madame
with
a
silver
laugh
and
began
to
busy
herself
with
the
teacups
he
remembered
as
he
was
looking
at
my
new
leonardo
an
appointment
which
he
had
quite
i
can
understand
his
forgetting
anything
under
the
madame
de
medici
raised
a
tiny
cup
and
bent
slightly
toward
him
he
felt
that
he
was
losing
control
of
himself
and
averting
his
eyes
he
stooped
and
smelled
the
orchid
in
his
buttonhole
then
accepting
the
cup
he
was
about
to
utter
some
light
commonplace
when
the
faintness
returned
overwhelmingly
and
hurriedly
replacing
the
cup
upon
the
tray
he
fell
back
among
the
cushions
the
stifling
perfume
of
the
place
seemed
to
be
choking
him
ah
poor
boy
you
are
really
not
at
all
well
how
sorry
i
am
the
sweet
tones
reached
him
as
from
a
great
distance
but
as
one
dying
in
the
desert
turns
his
face
toward
the
distant
oasis
deacon
turned
weakly
to
the
speaker
she
placed
one
fair
arm
behind
his
head
pillowing
him
and
with
a
peacock
fan
which
had
lain
amid
the
cushions
fanned
his
face
the
strange
scene
became
wholly
unreal
to
him
he
thought
himself
some
dying
barbaric
chief
rest
there
murmured
the
sweet
voice
the
great
eyes
unveiled
now
by
the
black
lashes
were
two
twin
lakes
of
fairest
amber
they
seemed
to
merge
together
so
that
he
stood
upon
the
brink
of
an
unfathomable
amber
pool
which
swallowed
him
up
which
swallowed
him
up
he
awoke
to
an
instantaneous
consciousness
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
guilty
of
inexcusably
bad
form
he
could
not
account
for
his
faintness
and
reclining
there
amid
the
silken
cushions
with
madame
de
medici
watching
him
anxiously
he
felt
a
hot
flush
stealing
over
his
face
what
is
the
matter
with
me
he
exclaimed
and
sprang
to
his
feet
i
feel
quite
well
she
watched
him
smiling
but
did
not
speak
he
was
a
very
young
man
again
and
badly
embarrassed
he
glanced
at
his
gracious
heavens
he
cried
and
noted
that
the
had
been
removed
there
must
be
something
radically
wrong
with
my
health
it
is
nearly
seven
the
note
of
the
silver
bell
sounded
in
the
can
you
forgive
me
he
said
but
madame
rising
to
her
feet
leaned
lightly
upon
his
shoulder
toying
with
the
petals
of
the
orchid
in
his
buttonhole
i
think
it
was
the
perfume
which
that
foolish
ah
li
lighted
she
whispered
looking
intently
into
his
eyes
and
it
is
you
who
have
to
forgive
me
but
you
will
i
know
the
silver
bell
rang
again
when
you
have
come
to
see
me
again
many
many
times
you
will
grow
to
love
it
because
i
love
she
touched
the
bell
upon
the
table
and
ah
li
entered
silently
when
madame
de
medici
held
out
her
hand
to
him
deacon
raised
the
white
fingers
to
his
lips
and
kissed
them
rapturously
then
he
turned
the
gascon
within
him
uppermost
again
and
ran
from
the
room
a
purple
curtain
was
drawn
across
the
lobby
screening
the
caller
newly
arrived
from
the
one
so
hurriedly
departing
iv
the
living
buddha
it
was
past
midnight
when
colonel
deacon
returned
to
the
house
rene
was
waiting
for
him
pacing
up
and
down
the
big
library
their
relationship
was
curious
as
subsisting
between
ward
and
guardian
for
these
two
despite
the
disparity
of
their
ages
had
few
secrets
from
one
another
rene
burned
to
pour
out
his
story
of
the
wonderful
madame
de
medici
of
the
secret
house
in
chinatown
with
its
deceptively
mean
exterior
and
its
gorgeous
interior
to
the
shrewd
and
worldly
elder
man
that
was
his
way
but
fate
had
an
oddly
bitter
moment
in
store
for
him
hallo
boy
cried
the
colonel
looking
into
the
library
glad
you
home
i
might
not
see
you
in
the
morning
and
i
want
to
tell
you
about
er
a
lady
who
will
be
coming
here
in
the
the
words
died
upon
rene
lips
unspoken
and
he
stared
blankly
at
the
colonel
i
thought
i
knew
all
there
was
to
know
about
pictures
antiques
and
all
that
sort
of
lumber
continued
colonel
deacon
in
his
rapid
and
manner
thought
there
were
many
men
in
london
could
teach
me
anything
certainly
never
suspected
a
woman
could
but
i
met
one
boy
gad
what
a
splendid
creature

know
there
is
much

the
world

know
all
the
advertised
beauties
of
europe
and
asia
stage
opera
and
ballet
and
all
the
rest
of
them
but
this
one
gad
he
dropped
into
an
clapping
both
his
hands
upon
his
knees
rene
stood
at
the
farther
end
of
the
library
in
the
shadow
watching
him
she
coming
here
boy
coming
here
gad
you
dog
fall
in
love
with
her
the
moment

see
her
sure

three
times
your
age
who

asked
rene
very
quietly

everybody
mad
to

but
nobody
knows
who
she
is
but
wait
till
you
see
her
lady

to
be
acquainted
with
her
but
you

cried
the
colonel
good
night
do
forget
to
be
in
afternoon
or

miss
meeting
the
loveliest
woman
in
london
and
the
most
what
is
her
name
eh
she
calls
herself
madame
de
medici
she
a
mystery
but
what
a
splendid
creature
rene
deacon
walked
slowly
upstairs
entered
his
bedroom
and
for
fully
an
hour
sat
in
the
darkness
thinking
thinking
am
i
going
mad
he
murmured
or
is
this
witch
driving
all
london
mad
he
strove
to
recover
something
of
the
glamour
which
had
mastered
him
when
in
the
presence
of
madame
de
medici
but
failed
yet
he
knew
that
once
near
her
again
it
would
all
return
his
reflections
were
bitter
and
when
at
last
wearily
he
undressed
and
went
to
bed
it
was
to
toss
restlessly
far
into
the
small
hours
ere
sleep
came
to
soothe
his
troubled
mind
but
his
sleep
was
disturbed
a
series
of
dreadfully
realistic
dreams
danced
through
his
brain
first
he
seemed
to
be
standing
upon
a
high
mountain
peak
with
eternal
snows
stretched
all
about
him
he
looked
down
past
the
snow
line
past
the
fir
woods
into
the
depths
of
a
lovely
lake
far
down
in
the
valley
below
it
was
a
lake
of
liquid
amber
and
as
he
looked
it
seemed
to
become
two
lakes
and
they
were
like
two
great
eyes
looking
up
at
him
and
summoning
him
to
leap
he
thought
that
he
leaped
a
prodigious
leap
far
out
into
space
then
fell
fell
fell
when
he
splashed
into
the
amber
deeps
they
became
churned
up
in
a
milky
foam
and
this
closed
about
him
with
a
strangle
grip
but
it
was
no
longer
foam
but
the
clinging
arms
of
madame
de
medici
then
he
stood
upon
a
fragile
bridge
of
bamboo
spanning
a
raging
torrent
right
and
left
of
the
torrent
below
were
jungles
in
which
moved
tigerish
shapes
upon
the
farther
side
of
the
bridge
madame
de
medici
clad
in
a
single
garment
of
silk
beckoned
to
him
he
sought
to
cross
the
bridge
but
it
collapsed
and
he
fell
near
the
edge
of
the
torrent
below
were
the
raging
waters
and
ever
nearing
him
the
tigerish
shapes
which
now
madame
was
calling
to
as
to
a
pack
of
hounds
they
were
about
to
devour
him
when
he
was
crouching
upon
a
ledge
high
above
a
street
which
seemed
to
be
vaguely
familiar
he
could
not
see
very
well
because
of
a
silk
mask
tied
upon
his
face
and
the
eyeholes
of
which
were
badly
cut
from
the
ledge
he
stepped
to
another
perilously
he
gained
it
and
crouching
there
where
there
was
scarce
foothold
for
a
cat
he
managed
fully
to
raise
a
window
which
already
was
raised
some
six
inches
then
softly
and
silently
for
he
was
he
entered
the
room
someone
slept
in
a
bed
facing
the
window
by
which
he
had
entered
and
upon
a
table
at
the
side
of
the
sleeper
lay
a
purse
a
bunch
of
keys
an
electric
torch
and
a
service
revolver
gliding
to
the
table
rene
took
the
keys
and
the
electric
torch
unlocked
the
door
of
the
room
and
crept
down
a
thickly
carpeted
stair
to
a
room
below
the
door
of
this
also
he
opened
with
one
of
the
keys
in
the
bunch
and
by
the
light
of
the
torch
found
his
way
through
a
quantity
of
antique
furniture
and
piled
up
curiosities
to
a
safe
set
in
the
farther
wall
he
seemed
in
his
dream
to
be
familiar
with
the
lock
combination
and
selecting
the
correct
key
from
the
bunch
he
soon
had
the
safe
open
the
shelves
within
were
laden
principally
with
antique
jewellery
statuettes
medals
scarabs
and
a
number
of
little
boxes
were
there
also
one
of
these
he
abstracted
relocked
the
safe
and
stepped
out
of
the
room
locking
the
door
behind
him
up
the
stairs
he
mounted
to
the
bedroom
wherein
he
had
left
the
sleeper
having
entered
he
locked
the
door
from
within
placed
the
keys
and
the
torch
upon
the
table
and
crept
out
again
upon
the
dizzy
ledge
poised
there
high
above
the
thoroughfare
below
a
great
nausea
attacked
him
glancing
to
the
right
in
the
direction
of
the
window
through
which
he
had
come
he
perceived
madame
de
medici
leaning
out
and
beckoning
to
him
her
arm
gleamed
whitely
in
the
faint
light
a
new
courage
came
to
him
he
succeeded
crouched
there
upon
the
narrow
ledge
in
relowering
the
window
and
leaving
it
in
the
state
in
which
he
had
found
it
he
stood
up
and
essayed
that
sickly
stride
to
the
adjoining
ledge
he
accomplished
it
knelt
and
crept
back
into
the
room
from
which
he
had
started
the
head
of
an
ivory
image
of
buddha
loomed
up
out
of
the
utter
darkness
growing
and
growing
until
it
seemed
like
a
great
mountain
he
could
not
believe
that
there
was
so
much
ivory
in
the
world
and
he
felt
it
with
his
fingers
wonderingly
as
he
did
so
it
began
to
shrink
and
shrink
and
shrink
and
shrink
until
it
was
no
larger
than
a
seated
human
figure
then
beneath
his
trembling
hands
it
became
animate
it
moved
extended
ivory
arms
and
wrapped
them
about
his
neck
its
lips
became
carmine
perfumed
they
bent
to
him
and
he
was
looking
into
the
bewitching
face
of
madame
de
medici
he
awoke
gasping
for
air
and
bathed
in
cold
perspiration
the
dawn
was
just
breaking
over
london
and
stealing
grayly
from
object
to
object
in
his
bedroom
v
the
ivory
god
the
great
car
with
its
fittings
of
gold
and
ivory
drew
up
at
the
door
of
colonel
deacon
house
the
interior
was
ablaze
with
tiger
lilies
and
out
from
their
midst
stepped
the
fairest
of
them
all
madame
de
medici
and
swept
queenly
up
the
steps
upon
the
arm
of
the
cavalierly
soldier
all
connoisseurs
esteemed
it
a
privilege
to
view
the
deacon
collection
and
this
afternoon
there
was
a
goodly
gathering
chairs
and
little
white
tables
were
dotted
about
the
lawn
in
shady
spots
and
the
majority
of
the
company
were
already
assembled
but
when
in
a
wonderful
golden
robe
madame
de
medici
glided
across
the
lawn
the
babel
ceased
abruptly
as
if
by
magic
she
pulled
off
one
glove
and
began
twirling
a
great
emerald
between
her
slim
fingers
it
was
suspended
from
a
thin
gold
chain
presently
descrying
annesley
seated
at
a
table
with
lady
dascot
she
raised
the
jewel
languidly
and
peered
through
it
at
the
two
why
exclaimed
rene
deacon
who
stood
close
beside
her
that
was
a
trick
of
nero
madame
laughed
musically
one
might
take
a
worse
model
she
said
softly
at
least
he
enjoyed
colonel
deacon
who
listened
to
her
every
word
as
to
the
utterance
of
a
cumaean
oracle
laughed
with
extraordinary
approbation
there
was
scarce
a
woman
present
who
regarded
madame
with
a
friendly
eye
nor
a
man
who
did
not
aspire
to
become
her
devoted
slave
she
brought
an
atmosphere
of
unreality
with
her
dominating
old
and
young
alike
by
virtue
of
her
splendid
pagan
beauty
the
lawn
with
its
very
modern
appointments
became
as
some
garden
of
the
golden
house
a
pleasure
ground
of
an
emperor
but
later
when
the
company
entered
the
house
and
colonel
deacon
sought
to
monopolize
the
society
of
madame
an
unhealthy
spirit
of
jealousy
arose
between
rene
and
his
guardian
it
was
strange
grotesque
horrible
almost
annesley
watched
from
afar
and
there
was
something
very
like
anger
in
his
glance
and
this
said
the
colonel
presently
taking
up
an
exquisitely
carved
ivory
buddha
has
a
strange
history
in
some
way
a
legend
has
grown
up
around
it
it
is
of
very
great
age
to
the
effect
that
it
must
always
cause
its
owner
to
lose
his
most
cherished
i
wonder
said
the
silvern
voice
that
you
who
possess
so
many
beautiful
things
should
consent
to
have
so
a
curiosity
in
your
i
do
not
fear
the
evil
charm
of
this
little
ivory
image
said
colonel
deacon
although
its
history
goes
far
to
bear
out
the
truth
of
the
legend
its
last
possessor
lost
his
most
cherished
possession
a
month
after
the
buddha
came
into
his
hands
he
fell
down
his
own
stairs
and
lost
his
life
madame
de
medici
languidly
surveyed
the
figure
through
the
upraised
emerald
really
she
murmured
and
the
one
from
whom
he
procured
it
a
hindu
usurer
of
simla
replied
the
colonel
his
daughter
stole
it
from
her
father
together
with
many
other
things
and
took
them
to
her
lover
with
whom
she
fled
madame
de
medici
seemed
to
be
slightly
interested
i
should
love
to
possess
so
weird
a
thing
she
said
softly
it
is
yours
exclaimed
the
colonel
and
placed
it
in
her
hands
oh
but
really
she
protested
but
really
i
insist
in
order
that
you
may
not
forget
your
first
visit
to
my
house
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
how
very
kind
you
are
colonel
deacon
she
said
to
a
rival
collector
now
that
the
menace
is
removed
said
colonel
deacon
with
laboured
humour
i
will
show
you
my
most
treasured
so
i
am
greatly
not
even
this
rascal
rene
said
the
colonel
stopping
before
a
safe
set
in
the
wall
has
seen
what
i
am
about
to
show
you
rene
started
slightly
and
watched
with
intense
interest
the
unlocking
of
the
safe
if
i
am
not
superstitious
about
the
ivory
buddha
continued
the
colonel
i
must
plead
guilty
in
the
case
of
the
key
of
the
temple
of
heaven
the
key
of
the
temple
of
heaven
murmured
a
lady
standing
immediately
behind
madame
de
medici
and
what
is
the
key
of
the
temple
of
heaven
the
colonel
having
unlocked
the
safe
straightened
himself
and
while
everyone
was
waiting
to
see
what
he
had
to
show
began
to
speak
again
pompously
the
temple
of
heaven
stands
in
the
outer
or
chinese
city
of
pekin
and
is
fabulously
wealthy
no
european
i
can
swear
had
ever
entered
its
secret
chambers
until
last
year
one
of
its
most
famous
treasures
was
this
key
it
was
used
only
to
open
the
special
entrance
reserved
for
the
emperor
when
he
came
to
worship
after
his
succession
to
the
throne
that
was
of
course
before
china
became
a
republic
the
key
is
studded
almost
all
over
with
precious
stones
last
year
a
certain
naval
man
i
not
mention
his
name
discovered
the
secret
of
its
how
he
came
by
that
knowledge
does
not
matter
at
present
one
very
dark
night
he
crept
up
to
the
temple
he
found
the
keeper
of
the
key
a
buddhist
priest
to
be
sleeping
and
he
succeeded
therefore
in
gaining
access
and
becoming
possessed
of
the
a
chorus
of
excited
exclamations
greeted
this
dramatic
point
of
the
story
the
object
of
this
outrage
continued
the
colonel
for
an
outrage
i
can
not
deny
it
to
have
been
was
not
a
romantic
one
the
poor
chap
wanted
money
and
he
thought
he
could
sell
the
key
to
one
of
the
native
jewellers
but
he
was
mistaken
he
got
back
safely
and
secretly
offered
it
in
various
directions
no
one
would
touch
the
thing
moreover
although
of
great
value
the
stones
were
very
far
from
flawless
and
not
really
worth
the
risks
which
he
had
run
to
secure
them
misunderstand
me
the
key
would
fetch
a
big
sum
but
not
a
yes
said
madame
de
medici
smiling
for
the
colonel
paused
he
packed
it
up
and
addressed
it
to
me
together
with
a
letter
the
price
that
he
asked
was
quite
a
moderate
one
and
when
the
key
arrived
in
england
i
dispatched
a
check
immediately
it
never
reached
why
cried
many
whom
this
strange
story
had
profoundly
interested
he
was
found
dead
at
the
back
of
the
native
cantonments
with
a
knife
in
his
heart
oh
exclaimed
lady
dascot
how
positively
ghastly
i
do
think
i
want
to
see
the
dreadful
thing
really
murmured
madame
de
medici
turning
languidly
to
the
speaker
i
the
colonel
stooped
and
reached
into
the
safe
then
he
began
to
take
out
object
after
object
box
after
box
finally
he
straightened
himself
again
and
all
saw
that
his
face
was
oddly
blanched
it
gone
he
whispered
hoarsely
the
key
of
the
temple
of
heaven
has
been
stolen
vi
madame
smiles
rene
entered
his
bedroom
locked
the
door
and
seated
himself
on
the
bed
then
he
lowered
his
head
into
his
hands
and
clutched
at
his
hair
distractedly
since
on
his
uncle
own
showing
no
one
knew
that
the
key
of
the
temple
of
heaven
had
been
in
the
safe
since
excepting
himself
rene
and
the
colonel
no
one
else
knew
the
lock
combination
how
the
key
had
been
stolen
was
a
mystery
which
defied
conjecture
no
one
but
the
colonel
had
approached
within
several
yards
of
the
safe
at
the
time
it
was
opened
so
that
clearly
the
theft
had
been
committed
prior
to
that
time
now
rene
sought
to
recall
the
details
of
a
strange
dream
which
he
had
dreamed
immediately
before
awakening
on
the
previous
night
but
he
sought
in
vain
his
memory
could
supply
only
blurred
images
there
had
been
a
safe
in
his
dream
and
he
was
it
he
or
another
had
unlocked
it
also

he
groaned
at
his
own
impotency
to
recall
the
circumstances
of
that
mysterious
perhaps
prophetic
dream
then
in
despair
he
gave
it
up
and
stooping
to
a
little
secretaire
unlocked
it
with
the
idea
of
sending
a
note
round
to
annesley
chambers
as
he
did
so
he
uttered
a
loud
cry

in
one
of
the

a
long
piece
of
black
silk
apparently
torn
from
the
lining
of
an
opera
hat
in
it
two
holes
were
cut
as
if
it
were
intended
to
be
used
as
a
mask
beside
it
lay
a
little
box
he
snatched
it
out
and
opened
it
it
was
empty

i
going
mad

groaned

the

recognizing
the
voice
of

himself

well
many
reasons
but
before

warning
though

rely
on
you
never
to

my
name

the
matter

the
woman
who
calls
herself
madame
de
medici
she

you
she
an
adventuress
and
has
a
dangerous
acquaintance
with
eastern
cults
and
i
ca
explain
properly
annesley

key
it
the
theft
of
the
key
that
has
prompted
me
to
speak
deacon
madame
has
some
sort
of
power
hypnotic
power
she
employed
it
on
me
once
to
my
cost
paul
harley
of
chancery
lane
can
tell
you
more
about
her
the
house
she
living
in
temporarily
used
to
belong
to
a
notorious
eurasian
zani
chada
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
i
dare
thwart
her
openly
but
i
felt
it
up
to
me
to
tell
you
that
she
possesses
the
secret
of
suggestion
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
think
you
stole
that
key
i
she
hypnotized
you
at
some
time
and
by
means
of
this
uncanny
power
of
hers
ordered
you
to
steal
the
key
of
the
temple
of
heaven
in
such
and
such
a
fashion
at
a
certain
hour
in
the
night
i
had
a
strange
seizure
while
i
was
at
her
house
exactly
during
that
time
you
were
receiving
your
hypnotic
orders
you
would
remember
nothing
of
them
until
the
time
to
execute
them
which
would
probably
be
during
sleep
in
a
state
of
artificial
somnambulism
and
under
the
direction
of
madame
will
you
became
a
burglar
as
madame
de
medici
car
drove
off
from
the
house
of
colonel
deacon
and
madame
seated
herself
in
the
cushioned
corner
up
from
amid
the
furs
upon
the
floor
where
he
had
lain
concealed
rose
the
little
yellow
man
from
the
temple
of
heaven
he
extended
eager
hands
toward
her
kneeling
there
and
spoke
quick
quick
he
breathed
you
have
it
the
key
of
the
madame
held
in
her
hand
an
ivory
buddha
inverting
it
she
unscrewed
the
pedestal
and
out
from
the
hollow
inside
the
image
dropped
a
gleaming
key
ah
breathed
the
yellow
man
and
would
have
clutched
it
but
madame
disdainfully
raised
her
right
hand
which
held
the
treasure
and
with
her
left
hand
thrust
down
the
clutching
yellow
fingers
she
dropped
the
key
between
her
white
skin
and
the
bodice
of
her
gown
tossing
the
ivory
figure
contemptuously
amid
the
fur
ah
repeated
the
yellow
man
in
a
different
tone
and
his
eyes
gleamed
with
the
flame
of
fanaticism
he
slowly
uprose
a
sinister
figure
and
with
distended
fingers
prepared
to
seize
madame
by
the
throat
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
his
nostrils
were
dilated
and
his
teeth
were
exposed
like
the
fangs
of
a
wolf
but
she
pulled
off
her
glove
and
stretched
out
her
bare
white
hand
to
him
as
a
queen
to
a
subject
she
raised
the
long
curved
lashes
and
the
great
amber
eyes
looked
into
the
angry
bloodshot
eyes
the
little
yellow
man
began
to
breathe
more
and
more
rapidly
soon
he
was
panting
like
one
in
a
fight
to
the
death
who
is
all
but
conquered
at
last
he
dropped
on
his
knees
amid
the
fur
and
the
curling
lashes
were
lowered
again
over
the
blazing
amber
eyes
that
had
conquered
madame
de
medici
lowered
her
beautiful
white
hand
and
the
little
yellow
man
seized
it
in
both
his
own
and
showered
rapturous
kisses
upon
it
madame
smiled
slightly
poor
little
yellow
man
she
murmured
in
sibilant
chinese
you
shall
never
return
to
the
temple
of
heaven
