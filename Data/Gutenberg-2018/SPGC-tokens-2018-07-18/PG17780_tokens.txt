in
introduction
george
eliot
or
mary
ann
evans
was
born
at
arbury
farm
in
the
parish
of
chilvers
coton
warwickshire
on
the
of
november
she
was
the
fifth
and
last
child
of
her
father
by
his
second
wife
of
that
father
whose
sound
sense
and
integrity
she
so
keenly
appreciated
and
who
was
to
a
certain
extent
the
original
of
her
famous
characters
of
adam
bede
and
caleb
garth
both
during
and
after
her
schooldays
george
eliot
history
was
that
of
a
mind
continually
its
conditions
she
became
an
excellent
housewife
and
a
devoted
daughter
but
her
nature
was
too
large
for
so
cramped
a
life
may
try
she
writes
in
daniel
deronda
you
can
never
imagine
what
it
is
to
have
a
man
force
of
genius
in
you
and
to
suffer
the
slavery
of
being
a
girl
while
her
powers
were
growing
she
necessarily
passed
through
many
phases
she
became
deeply
religious
and
wrote
poetry
pious
and
sweet
fair
of
its
kind
music
was
a
passion
with
her
in
a
characteristic
letter
written
at
the
age
of
twenty
to
a
friend
she
tries
but
fails
to
describe
her
experience
on
hearing
the
of
birmingham
a
stupid
drowsy
sensation
produced
by
standing
sentinel
over
damson
cheese
and
a
warm
stove
i
can
not
do
better
than
ask
you
to
read
if
accessible
wordsworth
short
poem
on
the
power
of
sound
there
you
have
a
concise
history
of
george
eliot
life
at
this
period
divided
as
it
was
between
music
literature
and
damson
cheese
sixteen
years
of
mental
work
and
effort
then
lay
between
her
and
her
first
achievement
years
during
which
she
read
industriously
and
thought
more
than
she
read
the
classics
french
german
and
italian
literature
she
laid
them
all
under
contribution
she
had
besides
the
art
of
fortunate
friendship
her
mind
naturally
chose
out
the
greater
intelligences
among
those
she
encountered
it
was
through
a
warm
and
enduring
friendship
with
herbert
spencer
that
she
met
at
last
with
george
henry
lewes
whose
wife
she
became
in
this
way
she
served
no
trifling
apprenticeship
natural
genius
experience
of
life
culture
and
great
companionship
had
joined
to
make
her
what
she
was
a
philosopher
both
natural
and
developed
and
what
is
more
rare
a
philosopher
with
a
sense
of
humour
and
a
perception
of
the
dramatic
thus
when
her
chance
came
she
was
fully
equipped
to
meet
it
it
came
when
at
the
age
of
she
began
to
write
barton
her
first
attempt
at
fiction
and
one
that
fixed
her
career
the
story
appeared
in
magazine
and
was
followed
by
love
story
and
repentance
of
the
three
gilfil
love
story
is
perhaps
the
most
finished
and
artistic
while
barton
has
qualities
of
humour
and
tenderness
that
have
not
often
been
equalled
repentance
strong
though
it
is
and
containing
the
remarkable
sketch
of
tryan
is
perhaps
less
surely
attractive
the
stories
all
three
of
them
have
a
particular
value
as
records
of
an
english
country
life
that
is
rapidly
passing
away
moreover
it
is
country
life
seen
through
the
medium
of
a
powerful
and
personality
it
is
her
intimate
and
thorough
knowledge
of
big
things
and
small
of
literature
and
damson
cheese
enabling
her
and
us
to
see
all
round
her
characters
that
provides
these
characters
with
their
ample
background
of
light
and
shade
it
is
well
to
realise
that
since
george
eliot
day
the
fashion
of
writing
the
temper
of
the
modern
mind
are
quite
changed
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
the
more
sophisticated
we
become
the
simpler
grows
our
speech
nowadays
we
talk
as
nearly
as
we
may
in
words
of
one
syllable
our
style
is
stripped
more
and
more
of
its
latinity
our
writers
are
more
and
more
in
love
with
french
methods
with
the
delicate
clearness
of
short
phrases
in
which
every
word
tells
with
the
rejection
of
all
intellectual
ambulations
round
about
a
subject
to
the
fanatics
of
this
modern
method
the
style
of
george
eliot
appears
strange
impossible
it
does
not
occur
to
them
that
her
method
has
virtues
which
lack
to
theirs
they
may
give
us
a
little
laboured
masterpiece
of
art
in
which
the
vital
principle
is
wanting
george
eliot
was
great
because
she
gave
us
passages
from
life
as
it
was
lived
in
her
day
which
will
be
vital
so
long
as
they
are
sympathetically
read
george
eliot
can
be
simple
enough
when
she
goes
straight
forward
with
her
narrative
as
for
instance
in
the
scene
of
milly
barton
death
then
her
english
is
clear
and
sweet
for
she
writes
from
the
heart
but
take
the
opening
chapter
of
the
same
story
and
then
you
find
her
philosophical
latinity
in
full
swing
the
curious
and
interesting
thing
being
that
this
otherwise
ponderous
work
which
is
quite
of
a
sort
to
alarm
a
frenchman
is
entirely
suffused
by
humour
and
enshrines
moreover
the
most
charming
character
studies
these
lively
and
acute
portraits
drawn
from
english
country
life
give
its
abiding
value
to
george
eliot
work
take
the
character
of
pilgrim
the
doctor
who
never
so
comfortable
as
when
relaxing
his
professional
legs
in
one
of
those
excellent
farmhouses
where
the
mice
are
sleek
and
the
mistress
sickly
or
of
hackit
thin
woman
with
a
chronic
liver
complaint
which
would
have
secured
her
pilgrim
entire
regard
and
unreserved
good
word
even
if
he
had
not
been
in
awe
of
her
tongue
or
take
patten
pretty
little
old
woman
of
eighty
with
a
close
cap
and
tiny
flat
white
curls
round
her
face
whose
function
is
in
an
under
the
sense
of
compound
interest
gradually
accumulating
and
who
her
malevolence
gently
or
hackit
a
shrewd
substantial
man
was
fond
of
soothing
the
acerbities
of
the
feminine
mind
by
a
jocose
compliment
where
but
in
george
eliot
would
you
get
a
described
with
such
charming
acceptance
of
whim
george
eliot
wrote
poems
at
various
times
which
showed
she
never
could
have
won
fame
as
a
poet
but
there
are
moments
of
her
prose
that
prove
she
shared
at
times
the
poet
vision
such
a
moment
is
that
when
the
half
little
catarina
looks
out
on
a
windy
night
landscape
lit
by
moonlight
trees
are
harassed
by
that
tossing
motion
when
they
would
like
to
be
at
rest
the
shivering
grass
makes
her
quake
with
sympathetic
cold
the
willows
by
the
pool
low
and
white
under
that
invisible
seem
agitated
and
helpless
like
herself
the
italicised
sentence
represents
the
mark
of
george
prose
that
passage
alone
should
vindicate
her
imaginative
power
contents
the
sad
fortunes
of

janet

scenes
of
clerical
life
the
sad
fortunes
of
the
rev
amos
barton
chapter
shepperton
church
was
a
very
building
years
ago
to
be
sure
its
substantial
stone
tower
looks
at
you
through
its
intelligent
eye
the
clock
with
the
friendly
expression
of
former
days
but
in
everything
else
what
changes
now
there
is
a
wide
span
of
slated
roof
flanking
the
old
steeple
the
windows
are
tall
and
symmetrical
the
outer
doors
are
resplendent
with
the
inner
doors
reverentially
noiseless
with
a
garment
of
red
baize
and
the
walls
you
are
convinced
no
lichen
will
ever
again
effect
a
settlement
on
they
are
smooth
and
innutrient
as
the
summit
of
the
rev
amos
barton
head
after
ten
years
of
baldness
and
supererogatory
soap
pass
through
the
baize
doors
and
you
will
see
the
nave
filled
with
benches
understood
to
be
free
seats
while
in
certain
eligible
corners
less
directly
under
the
fire
of
the
clergyman
eye
there
are
pews
reserved
for
the
shepperton
gentility
ample
galleries
are
supported
on
iron
pillars
and
in
one
of
them
stands
the
crowning
glory
the
very
clasp
or
aigrette
of
shepperton
namely
an
organ
not
very
much
out
of
repair
on
which
a
collector
of
small
rents
differentiated
by
the
force
of
circumstances
into
an
organist
will
accompany
the
alacrity
of
your
departure
after
the
blessing
by
a
sacred
minuet
or
an
easy
immense
improvement
says
the
mind
which
unintermittingly
rejoices
in
the
new
police
the
tithe
commutation
act
the
and
all
guarantees
of
human
advancement
and
has
no
moments
when
intellect
takes
a
nap
while
imagination
does
a
little
toryism
by
the
sly
revelling
in
regret
that
dear
old
brown
crumbling
picturesque
inefficiency
is
everywhere
giving
place
to
efficiency
which
will
yield
endless
diagrams
plans
elevations
and
sections
but
alas
no
picture
mine
i
fear
is
not
a
mind
it
has
an
occasional
tenderness
for
old
abuses
it
lingers
with
a
certain
fondness
over
the
days
of
nasal
clerks
and
parsons
and
has
a
sigh
for
the
departed
shades
of
vulgar
errors
so
it
is
not
surprising
that
i
recall
with
a
fond
sadness
shepperton
church
as
it
was
in
the
old
days
with
its
outer
coat
of
rough
stucco
its
roof
its
heterogeneous
windows
patched
with
desultory
bits
of
painted
glass
and
its
little
flight
of
steps
with
their
wooden
rail
running
up
the
outer
wall
and
leading
to
the
gallery
then
inside
what
dear
old
quaintnesses
which
i
began
to
look
at
with
delight
even
when
i
was
so
crude
a
members
of
the
congregation
that
my
nurse
found
it
necessary
to
provide
for
the
reinforcement
of
my
devotional
patience
by
smuggling
into
the
sacred
edifice
there
was
the
chancel
guarded
by
two
little
cherubims
looking
uncomfortably
squeezed
between
arch
and
wall
and
adorned
with
the
escutcheons
of
the
oldinport
family
which
showed
me
inexhaustible
possibilities
of
meaning
in
their
hands
their
and
their
leopards
paws
and
maltese
crosses
there
were
inscriptions
on
the
panels
of
the
telling
of
benefactions
to
the
poor
of
shepperton
with
an
involuted
elegance
of
capitals
and
final
flourishes
which
my
alphabetic
erudition
traced
with
delight
no
benches
in
those
days
but
huge
roomy
pews
round
which
devout
sat
during
trying
to
look
anywhere
else
than
into
each
other
eyes
no
low
partitions
allowing
you
with
a
dreary
absence
of
contrast
and
mystery
to
see
everything
at
all
moments
but
tall
dark
panels
under
whose
shadow
i
sank
with
a
sense
of
retirement
through
the
litany
only
to
feel
with
more
intensity
my
burst
into
the
conspicuousness
of
public
life
when
i
was
made
to
stand
up
on
the
seat
during
the
psalms
or
the
singing
and
the
singing
was
no
mechanical
affair
of
official
routine
it
had
a
drama
as
the
moment
of
psalmody
approached
by
some
process
to
me
as
mysterious
and
untraceable
as
the
opening
of
the
flowers
or
the
of
the
stars
a
slate
appeared
in
front
of
the
gallery
advertising
in
bold
characters
the
psalm
about
to
be
sung
lest
the
sonorous
announcement
of
the
clerk
should
still
leave
the
bucolic
mind
in
doubt
on
that
head
then
followed
the
migration
of
the
clerk
to
the
gallery
where
in
company
with
a
bassoon
two
a
carpenter
understood
to
have
an
amazing
power
of
singing
and
two
lesser
musical
stars
he
formed
the
complement
of
a
choir
regarded
in
shepperton
as
one
of
distinguished
attraction
occasionally
known
to
draw
hearers
from
the
next
parish
the
innovation
of
was
as
yet
undreamed
of
even
the
new
version
was
regarded
with
a
sort
of
melancholy
tolerance
as
part
of
the
common
degeneracy
in
a
time
when
prices
had
dwindled
and
a
cotton
gown
was
no
longer
stout
enough
to
last
a
lifetime
for
the
lyrical
taste
of
the
best
heads
in
shepperton
had
been
formed
on
sternhold
and
hopkins
but
the
greatest
triumphs
of
the
shepperton
choir
were
reserved
for
the
sundays
when
the
slate
announced
an
anthem
with
a
dignified
abstinence
from
particularization
both
words
and
music
lying
far
beyond
the
reach
of
the
most
ambitious
amateur
in
the
congregation
an
anthem
in
which
the
always
ran
away
at
a
great
pace
while
the
bassoon
every
now
and
then
boomed
a
flying
shot
after
them
as
for
the
clergyman
gilfil
an
excellent
old
gentleman
who
smoked
very
long
pipes
and
preached
very
short
sermons
i
must
not
speak
of
him
or
i
might
be
tempted
to
tell
the
story
of
his
life
which
had
its
little
romance
as
most
lives
have
between
the
ages
of
teetotum
and
tobacco
and
at
present
i
am
concerned
with
quite
another
sort
of
clergyman
the
rev
amos
barton
who
did
not
come
to
shepperton
until
long
after
gilfil
had
departed
this
life
until
after
an
interval
in
which
evangelicalism
and
the
catholic
question
had
begun
to
agitate
the
rustic
mind
with
controversial
debates
a
popish
blacksmith
had
produced
a
strong
protestant
reaction
by
declaring
that
as
soon
as
the
emancipation
bill
was
passed
he
should
do
a
great
stroke
of
business
in
gridirons
and
the
disinclination
of
the
shepperton
parishioners
generally
to
dim
the
unique
glory
of
st
lawrence
rendered
the
church
and
constitution
an
affair
of
their
business
and
bosoms
a
zealous
evangelical
preacher
had
made
the
old
vibrate
with
quite
a
different
sort
of
elocution
from
gilfil
the
had
almost
superseded
the
old
and
new
versions
and
the
great
square
pews
were
crowded
with
new
faces
from
distant
corners
of
the
parish
perhaps
from
dissenting
chapels
you
are
not
imagining
i
hope
that
amos
barton
was
the
incumbent
of
shepperton
he
was
no
such
thing
those
were
days
when
a
man
could
hold
three
small
livings
starve
a
curate
on
two
of
them
and
live
badly
himself
on
the
third
it
was
so
with
the
vicar
of
shepperton
a
vicar
given
to
bricks
and
mortar
and
thereby
running
into
debt
far
away
in
a
northern
county
who
executed
his
vicarial
functions
towards
shepperton
by
pocketing
the
sum
of
pounds
ten
per
annum
the
net
surplus
remaining
to
him
from
the
proceeds
of
that
living
after
the
disbursement
of
eighty
pounds
as
the
annual
stipend
of
his
curate
and
now
pray
can
you
solve
me
the
following
problem
given
a
man
with
a
wife
and
six
children
let
him
be
obliged
always
to
exhibit
himself
when
outside
his
own
door
in
a
suit
of
black
broadcloth
such
as
will
not
undermine
the
foundations
of
the
establishment
by
a
paltry
plebeian
glossiness
or
an
unseemly
whiteness
at
the
edges
in
a
snowy
cravat
which
is
a
serious
investment
of
labour
in
the
hemming
starching
and
ironing
departments
and
in
a
hat
which
shows
no
symptom
of
taking
to
the
hideous
doctrine
of
expediency
and
shaping
itself
according
to
circumstances
let
him
have
a
parish
large
enough
to
create
an
external
necessity
for
abundant
and
an
internal
necessity
for
abundant
beef
and
mutton
as
well
as
poor
enough
to
require
frequent
priestly
consolation
in
the
shape
of
shillings
and
sixpences
and
lastly
let
him
be
compelled
by
his
own
pride
and
other
people
to
dress
his
wife
and
children
with
gentility
from
to
by
what
process
of
division
can
the
sum
of
eighty
pounds
per
annum
be
made
to
yield
a
quotient
which
will
cover
that
man
weekly
expenses
this
was
the
problem
presented
by
the
position
of
the
rev
amos
barton
as
curate
of
shepperton
rather
more
than
twenty
years
ago
what
was
thought
of
this
problem
and
of
the
man
who
had
to
work
it
out
by
some
of
the
inhabitants
of
shepperton
two
years
or
more
after
barton
arrival
among
them
you
shall
hear
if
you
will
accompany
me
to
cross
farm
and
to
the
fireside
of
patten
a
childless
old
lady
who
had
got
rich
chiefly
by
the
negative
process
of
spending
nothing
patten
passive
accumulation
of
wealth
through
all
sorts
of
times
on
the
farm
of
which
she
had
been
sole
tenant
since
her
husband
death
her
epigrammatic
neighbour
hackit
sarcastically
accounted
for
by
supposing
that
grew
on
the
bents
of
cross
farm
while
hackit
expressing
his
views
more
literally
reminded
his
wife
that
breeds
money
and
hackit
from
the
neighbouring
farm
are
patten
guests
this
evening
so
is
pilgrim
the
doctor
from
the
nearest
who
though
occasionally
affecting
aristocratic
airs
and
giving
late
dinners
with
enigmatic
and
poisonous
port
is
never
so
comfortable
as
when
he
is
relaxing
his
professional
legs
in
one
of
those
excellent
farmhouses
where
the
mice
are
sleek
and
the
mistress
sickly
and
he
is
at
this
moment
in
clover
for
the
flickering
of
patten
bright
fire
is
reflected
in
her
bright
copper
the
muffins
glisten
with
an
inviting
succulence
and
patten
niece
a
single
lady
of
fifty
who
has
refused
the
most
ineligible
offers
out
of
devotion
to
her
aged
aunt
is
pouring
the
rich
cream
into
the
fragrant
tea
with
a
discreet
liberality
reader
you
ever
taste
such
a
cup
of
tea
as
miss
gibbs
is
this
moment
handing
to
pilgrim
do
you
know
the
dulcet
strength
the
animating
blandness
of
tea
sufficiently
blended
with
real
farmhouse
cream
no
most
likely
you
are
a
miserable
reader
who
think
of
cream
as
a
thinnish
white
fluid
delivered
in
infinitesimal
pennyworths
down
area
steps
or
perhaps
from
a
presentiment
of
calves
brains
you
refrain
from
any
lacteal
addition
and
rasp
your
tongue
with
unmitigated
bohea
you
have
a
vague
idea
of
a
milch
cow
as
probably
a
animal
standing
in
a
butterman
window
and
you
know
nothing
of
the
sweet
history
of
genuine
cream
such
as
miss
gibbs
how
it
was
this
morning
in
the
udders
of
the
large
sleek
beasts
as
they
stood
lowing
a
patient
entreaty
under
the
how
it
fell
with
a
pleasant
rhythm
into
betty
pail
sending
a
delicious
incense
into
the
cool
air
how
it
was
carried
into
that
temple
of
moist
cleanliness
the
dairy
where
it
quietly
separated
itself
from
the
meaner
elements
of
milk
and
lay
in
mellowed
whiteness
ready
for
the
which
transferred
it
to
miss
gibbs
glass
if
i
am
right
in
my
conjecture
you
are
unacquainted
with
the
highest
possibilities
of
tea
and
pilgrim
who
is
holding
that
cup
in
his
hands
has
an
idea
beyond
you
hackit
declines
cream
she
has
so
long
abstained
from
it
with
an
eye
to
the
weekly
that
abstinence
wedded
to
habit
has
begotten
aversion
she
is
a
thin
woman
with
a
chronic
which
would
have
secured
her
pilgrim
entire
regard
and
unreserved
good
word
even
if
he
had
not
been
in
awe
of
her
tongue
which
was
as
sharp
as
his
own
lancet
she
has
brought
her
knitting
no
frivolous
fancy
knitting
but
a
substantial
woollen
stocking
the
of
her
is
the
running
accompaniment
to
all
her
conversation
and
in
her
utmost
enjoyment
of
spoiling
a
friend
she
was
never
known
to
spoil
a
stocking
patten
does
not
admire
this
excessive
activity
quiescence
in
an
under
the
sense
of
compound
interest
perpetually
accumulating
has
long
seemed
an
ample
function
to
her
and
she
does
her
malevolence
gently
she
is
a
pretty
little
old
woman
of
eighty
with
a
close
cap
and
tiny
flat
white
curls
round
her
face
as
natty
and
unsoiled
and
invariable
as
the
waxen
image
of
a
little
old
lady
under
a
once
a
and
married
for
her
beauty
she
used
to
adore
her
husband
and
now
she
adores
her
money
cherishing
a
quiet
hatred
for
her
niece
janet
gibbs
who
she
knows
expects
a
large
legacy
and
whom
she
is
determined
to
disappoint
her
money
shall
all
go
in
a
lump
to
a
distant
relation
of
her
husband
and
janet
shall
be
saved
the
trouble
of
pretending
to
cry
by
finding
that
she
is
left
with
a
miserable
pittance
patten
has
more
respect
for
her
neighbour
hackit
than
for
most
people
hackit
is
a
shrewd
substantial
man
whose
advice
about
crops
is
always
worth
listening
to
and
who
is
too
well
off
to
want
to
borrow
money
and
now
that
we
are
snug
and
warm
with
this
little
while
it
is
freezing
with
february
bitterness
outside
we
will
listen
to
what
they
are
talking
about
said
pilgrim
with
his
mouth
only
half
empty
of
muffin
had
a
row
in
shepperton
church
last
sunday
i
was
at
jim
hood
the
this
morning
attending
his
wife
and
he
swears
he
be
revenged
on
the
parson
a
confounded
methodistical
meddlesome
chap
who
must
be
putting
his
finger
in
every
pie
what
was
it
all
about
a
passill
o
nonsense
said
hackit
sticking
one
thumb
between
the
buttons
of
his
capacious
waistcoat
and
retaining
a
pinch
of
snuff
with
the
other
for
he
was
but
moderately
given
to
cups
that
cheer
but
not
inebriate
and
had
already
finished
his
tea
began
to
sing
the
wedding
psalm
for
a
couple
as
pretty
a
psalm
an
as
pretty
a
tune
as
any
in
the
it
been
sung
for
every
couple
since
i
was
a
boy
and
what
can
be
better
here
hackit
stretched
out
his
left
arm
threw
back
his
head
and
broke
into
melody
what
a
happy
thing
it
is
and
joyful
for
to
see
brethren
to
dwell
together
in
friendship
and
unity
but
barton
is
all
for
th
hymns
and
a
sort
o
music
as
i
ca
join
in
at
all
so
said
pilgrim
recalling
hackit
from
lyrical
reminiscences
to
narrative
called
out
silence
did
he
when
he
got
into
the
pulpit
and
gave
a
hymn
out
himself
to
some
tune
said
hackit
stooping
towards
the
candle
to
pick
up
a
stitch
turned
as
red
as
a
i
often
say
when
he
preaches
about
meekness
he
gives
himself
a
slap
in
the
face
he
like
me
he
got
a
temper
of
his
own
a
fellow
i
think
barton
said
pilgrim
who
hated
the
reverend
amos
for
two
reasons
because
he
had
called
in
a
new
doctor
recently
settled
in
shepperton
and
because
being
himself
a
dabbler
in
drugs
he
had
the
credit
of
having
cured
a
patient
of
pilgrim
say
his
father
was
a
dissenting
shoemaker
and
he
half
a
dissenter
himself
why
does
he
preach
extempore
in
that
cottage
up
here
of
a
sunday
evening
this
was
hackit
favourite
interjection
preaching
without
book
no
good
only
when
a
man
has
a
gift
and
has
the
bible
at
his
fingers
ends
it
was
all
very
well
for
parry
he
a
gift
and
in
my
youth
i
heard
the
ranters
out
o
doors
in
yorkshire
go
on
for
an
hour
or
two
on
end
without
ever
sticking
fast
a
minute
there
was
one
clever
chap
i
remember
as
used
to
say
you
like
the
woodpigeon
it
says
do
do
do
all
day
and
never
sets
about
any
work
itself
bringing
it
home
to
people
but
our
parson
no
gift
at
all
that
way
he
can
preach
as
good
a
sermon
as
need
be
heard
when
he
writes
it
down
but
when
he
tries
to
preach
book
he
rambles
about
and
does
stick
to
his
text
and
every
now
and
then
he
flounders
about
like
a
sheep
as
has
cast
itself
and
ca
get
legs
again
you
would
like
that
patten
if
you
was
to
go
to
church
now
dear
said
patten
falling
back
in
her
chair
and
lifting
up
her
little
withered
hands
gilfil
say
if
he
was
worthy
to
know
the
changes
as
have
come
about
i
the
church
these
last
ten
years
i
do
understand
these
new
sort
o
doctrines
when
barton
comes
to
see
me
he
talks
about
nothing
but
my
sins
and
my
need
o
marcy
now
hackit
i
never
been
a
sinner
from
the
fust
beginning
when
i
went
into
service
i
did
my
duty
by
my
emplyers
i
was
a
good
wife
as
any
in
the
county
never
aggravated
my
husband
the
used
to
say
my
cheese
was
to
be
depended
on
i
known
women
as
their
cheeses
swelled
a
shame
to
be
seen
when
their
husbands
had
counted
on
the
to
make
up
their
rent
and
yet
they
three
gowns
to
my
one
if
i
not
to
be
saved
i
know
a
many
as
are
in
a
bad
way
but
well
for
me
as
i
ca
go
to
church
any
longer
for
if
th
old
singers
are
to
be
done
away
with
there
be
nothing
left
as
it
was
in
patten
time
and
what
more
i
hear
you
settled
to
pull
the
church
down
and
build
it
up
new
now
the
fact
was
that
the
rev
amos
barton
on
his
last
visit
to
patten
had
urged
her
to
enlarge
her
promised
subscription
of
twenty
pounds
representing
to
her
that
she
was
only
a
steward
of
her
riches
and
that
she
could
not
spend
them
more
for
the
glory
of
god
than
by
giving
a
heavy
subscription
towards
the
rebuilding
of
shepperton
church
a
practical
precept
which
was
not
likely
to
smooth
the
way
to
her
acceptance
of
his
theological
doctrine
hackit
who
had
more
doctrinal
enlightenment
than
patten
had
been
a
little
shocked
by
the
heathenism
of
her
speech
and
was
glad
of
the
new
turn
given
to
the
subject
by
this
question
addressed
to
him
as
and
an
authority
in
all
parochial
matters
he
answered
parson
bothered
us
into
it
at
last
and
to
begin
pulling
down
this
spring
but
we
have
got
money
enough
yet
i
was
for
waiting
till
we
made
up
the
sum
and
for
my
part
i
think
the
congregation
fell
off
o
late
though
barton
says
that
because
there
been
no
room
for
the
people
when
they
come
you
see
the
congregation
got
so
large
in
parry
time
the
people
stood
in
the
aisles
but
there
never
any
crowd
now
as
i
can
see
said
hackit
whose
began
to
act
now
that
it
was
a
little
in
contradiction
with
the
dominant
tone
of
the
conversation
like
barton
i
think
he
a
good
sort
o
man
for
all
he
not
overburthen
i
th
upper
storey
and
his
wife
as
nice
a
woman
as
i
wish
to
see
how
nice
she
keeps
her
children
and
little
enough
money
to
with
and
a
delicate
creatur
six
children
and
another
i
do
know
how
they
make
both
ends
meet
i
sure
now
her
aunt
has
left
but
i
sent
a
cheese
and
a
sack
o
potatoes
last
week
that
something
towards
filling
the
little
mouths
said
hackit
my
wife
makes
barton
a
good
stiff
glass
o
when
he
comes
into
supper
after
his
cottage
preaching
the
parson
likes
it
it
puts
a
bit
o
colour
into
face
and
makes
him
look
a
deal
handsomer
this
allusion
to
suggested
to
miss
gibbs
the
introduction
of
the
liquor
decanters
now
that
the
tea
was
cleared
away
for
in
bucolic
society
years
ago
the
human
animal
of
the
male
sex
was
understood
to
be
perpetually
athirst
and
to
drink
was
as
necessary
a
of
thought
as
time
and
space
that
cottage
preaching
said
pilgrim
mixing
himself
a
strong
glass
of
without
was
talking
about
it
to
our
parson
ely
the
other
day
and
he
does
approve
of
it
at
all
he
said
it
did
as
much
harm
as
good
to
give
a
too
familiar
aspect
to
religious
teaching
that
was
what
ely
said
it
does
as
much
harm
as
good
to
give
a
too
familiar
aspect
to
religious
teaching
pilgrim
generally
spoke
with
an
intermittent
kind
of
splutter
indeed
one
of
his
patients
had
observed
that
it
was
a
pity
such
a
clever
man
had
a
in
his
speech
but
when
he
came
to
what
he
conceived
the
pith
of
his
argument
or
the
point
of
his
joke
he
mouthed
out
his
words
with
slow
emphasis
as
a
hen
when
advertising
her
accouchement
passes
at
irregular
intervals
from
pianissimo
semiquavers
to
fortissimo
crotchets
he
thought
this
speech
of
ely
particularly
metaphysical
and
profound
and
the
more
decisive
of
the
question
because
it
was
a
generality
which
represented
no
particulars
to
his
mind
i
do
know
about
that
said
hackit
who
had
always
the
courage
of
her
opinion
i
know
some
of
our
labourers
and
stockingers
as
used
never
to
come
to
church
come
to
the
cottage
and
that
better
than
never
hearing
anything
good
from
week
end
to
end
and
there
that
track
society
as
barton
has
begun
i
seen
more
o
the
poor
people
with
going
tracking
than
all
the
time
i
lived
in
the
parish
before
and
there
need
be
something
done
among
for
the
drinking
at
them
benefit
clubs
is
shameful
there
hardly
a
steady
man
or
steady
woman
either
but
what
a
dissenter
during
this
speech
of
hackit
pilgrim
had
emitted
a
succession
of
little
snorts
something
like
the
treble
grunts
of
a
which
were
always
with
him
the
sign
of
suppressed
disapproval
but
he
never
contradicted
hackit
a
woman
whose
was
always
to
be
relied
on
and
who
on
her
side
had
unlimited
reliance
on
bleeding
blistering
and
draughts
patten
however
felt
equal
disapprobation
and
had
no
reasons
for
suppressing
it
she
remarked
heared
of
no
good
from
interfering
with
neighbours
poor
or
rich
and
i
hate
the
sight
o
women
going
about
trapesing
from
house
to
house
in
all
weathers
wet
or
dry
and
coming
in
with
their
petticoats
dagged
and
their
shoes
all
over
mud
janet
wanted
to
join
in
the
tracking
but
i
told
her
i
have
nobody
tracking
out
my
house
when
i
gone
she
may
do
as
she
likes
i
never
dagged
my
petticoats
in
life
and
i
no
opinion
o
that
sort
o
religion
said
hackit
who
was
fond
of
soothing
the
acerbities
of
the
feminine
mind
with
a
jocose
compliment
held
your
petticoats
so
high
to
show
your
tight
ankles
it
is
everybody
as
likes
to
show
her
ankles
this
joke
met
with
general
acceptance
even
from
the
snubbed
janet
whose
ankles
were
only
tight
in
the
sense
of
looking
extremely
squeezed
by
her
boots
but
janet
seemed
always
to
identify
herself
with
her
personality
holding
her
own
under
protest
under
cover
of
the
general
laughter
the
gentlemen
replenished
their
glasses
pilgrim
attempting
to
give
his
the
character
of
a
by
observing
that
he
be
going
miss
gibbs
seized
this
opportunity
of
telling
hackit
that
she
suspected
betty
the
dairymaid
of
frying
the
best
bacon
for
the
shepherd
when
he
sat
up
with
her
to
brew
whereupon
hackit
replied
that
she
had
always
thought
betty
false
and
patten
said
there
was
no
bacon
stolen
when
was
able
to
manage
hackit
who
often
complained
that
he
saw
the
like
to
women
with
their
maids
he
never
had
any
trouble
with
his
men
avoided
listening
to
this
discussion
by
raising
the
question
of
vetches
with
pilgrim
the
stream
of
conversation
had
thus
diverged
and
no
more
was
said
about
the
rev
amos
barton
who
is
the
main
object
of
interest
to
us
just
now
so
we
may
leave
cross
farm
without
waiting
till
hackit
resolutely
donning
her
clogs
and
wrappings
renders
it
incumbent
on
pilgrim
also
to
fulfil
his
frequent
threat
of
going
chapter
it
was
happy
for
the
rev
amos
barton
that
he
did
not
like
us
overhear
the
conversation
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
indeed
what
mortal
is
there
of
us
who
would
find
his
satisfaction
enhanced
by
an
opportunity
of
comparing
the
picture
he
presents
to
himself
of
his
own
doings
with
the
picture
they
make
on
the
mental
retina
of
his
neighbours
we
are
poor
plants
buoyed
up
by
the
of
our
own
conceit
alas
for
us
if
we
get
a
few
pinches
that
empty
us
of
that
windy
the
very
capacity
for
good
would
go
out
of
us
for
tell
the
most
impassioned
orator
suddenly
that
his
wig
is
awry
or
his
hanging
out
and
that
he
is
tickling
people
by
the
oddity
of
his
person
instead
of
thrilling
them
by
the
energy
of
his
periods
and
you
would
infallibly
dry
up
the
spring
of
his
eloquence
that
is
a
deep
and
wide
saying
that
no
miracle
can
be
wrought
without
faith
without
the
worker
faith
in
himself
as
well
as
the
recipient
faith
in
him
and
the
greater
part
of
the
worker
faith
in
himself
is
made
up
of
the
faith
that
others
believe
in
him
let
me
be
persuaded
that
my
neighbour
jenkins
considers
me
a
blockhead
and
i
shall
never
shine
in
conversation
with
him
any
more
let
me
discover
that
the
lovely
phoebe
thinks
my
squint
intolerable
and
i
shall
never
be
able
to
fix
her
blandly
with
my
disengaged
eye
again
thank
heaven
then
that
a
little
illusion
is
left
to
us
to
enable
us
to
be
useful
and
agreeable
that
we
do
know
exactly
what
our
friends
think
of
us
that
the
world
is
not
made
of
to
show
us
just
the
figure
we
are
making
and
just
what
is
going
on
behind
our
backs
by
the
help
of
dear
friendly
illusion
we
are
able
to
dream
that
we
are
charming
and
our
faces
wear
a
becoming
air
of
we
are
able
to
dream
that
other
men
admire
our
talents
and
our
benignity
is
undisturbed
we
are
able
to
dream
that
we
are
doing
much
good
and
we
do
a
little
thus
it
was
with
amos
barton
on
that
very
thursday
evening
when
he
was
the
subject
of
the
conversation
at
cross
farm
he
had
been
dining
at
farquhar
the
secondary
squire
of
the
parish
and
stimulated
by
unwonted
gravies
and
had
been
delivering
his
opinion
on
affairs
parochial
and
otherwise
with
considerable
animation
and
he
was
now
returning
home
in
the
moonlight
a
little
chill
it
is
true
for
he
had
just
now
no
greatcoat
compatible
with
clerical
dignity
and
a
fur
boa
round
one
neck
with
a
waterproof
cape
over
shoulders
does
frighten
away
the
cold
from
one
legs
but
entirely
unsuspicious
not
only
of
hackit
estimate
of
his
oratorical
powers
but
also
of
the
critical
remarks
passed
on
him
by
the
misses
farquhar
as
soon
as
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
miss
julia
had
observed
that
she
heard
any
one
sniff
so
frightfully
as
barton
did
she
had
a
great
mind
to
offer
him
her
and
miss
arabella
wondered
why
he
always
said
he
was
going
to
do
a
thing
he
excellent
man
was
meditating
fresh
pastoral
exertions
on
the
morrow
he
would
set
on
foot
his
lending
library
in
which
he
had
introduced
some
books
that
would
be
a
pretty
sharp
blow
to
the
dissenters
one
especially
purporting
to
be
written
by
a
working
man
who
out
of
pure
zeal
for
the
welfare
of
his
class
took
the
trouble
to
warn
them
in
this
way
against
those
hypocritical
thieves
the
dissenting
preachers
the
rev
amos
barton
profoundly
believed
in
the
existence
of
that
working
man
and
had
thoughts
of
writing
to
him
dissent
he
considered
would
have
its
head
bruised
in
shepperton
for
did
he
not
attack
it
in
two
ways
he
preached
doctrine
as
evangelical
as
anything
to
be
heard
in
the
independent
chapel
and
he
made
a
assertion
of
ecclesiastical
powers
and
functions
clearly
the
dissenters
would
feel
that
parson
was
too
many
for
them
nothing
like
a
man
who
combines
shrewdness
with
energy
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
barton
considered
was
one
of
his
strong
points
look
at
him
as
he
winds
through
the
little
churchyard
the
silver
light
that
falls
aslant
on
church
and
tomb
enables
you
to
see
his
slim
black
figure
made
all
the
slimmer
by
tight
pantaloons
as
it
flits
past
the
pale
gravestones
he
walks
with
a
quick
step
and
is
now
rapping
with
sharp
decision
at
the
vicarage
door
it
is
opened
without
delay
by
the
nurse
cook
and
housemaid
all
at
once
that
is
to
say
by
the
robust
nanny
and
as
barton
hangs
up
his
hat
in
the
passage
you
see
that
a
narrow
face
of
no
particular
complexion
even
the
that
has
attacked
it
seems
to
have
been
of
a
mongrel
indefinite
kind
with
features
of
no
particular
shape
and
an
eye
of
no
particular
expression
is
surmounted
by
a
slope
of
baldness
gently
rising
from
brow
to
crown
you
judge
him
rightly
to
be
about
forty
the
house
is
quiet
for
it
is
ten
and
the
children
have
long
been
gone
to
bed
he
opens
the
door
but
instead
of
seeing
his
wife
as
he
expected
stitching
with
the
nimblest
of
fingers
by
the
light
of
one
candle
he
finds
her
dispensing
with
the
light
of
a
candle
altogether
she
is
softly
pacing
up
and
down
by
the
red
firelight
holding
in
her
arms
little
walter
the
baby
who
looks
over
her
shoulder
with
large
eyes
while
the
patient
mother
pats
his
back
with
her
soft
hand
and
glances
with
a
sigh
at
the
heap
of
large
and
small
stockings
lying
unmended
on
the
table
she
was
a
lovely
woman
amos
barton
a
large
fair
gentle
madonna
with
thick
close
chestnut
curls
beside
her
cheeks
and
with
large
tender
eyes
the
flowing
lines
of
her
tall
figure
made
the
limpest
dress
look
graceful
and
her
old
frayed
black
silk
seemed
to
repose
on
her
bust
and
limbs
with
a
placid
elegance
and
sense
of
distinction
in
strong
contrast
with
the
uneasy
sense
of
being
no
fit
that
seemed
to
express
itself
in
the
rustling
of
de
the
caps
she
wore
would
have
been
pronounced
when
off
her
head
utterly
heavy
and
hideous
for
in
those
days
even
fashionable
caps
were
large
and
floppy
but
surmounting
her
long
arched
neck
and
mingling
their
borders
of
cheap
lace
and
ribbon
with
her
chestnut
curls
they
seemed
miracles
of
successful
millinery
among
strangers
she
was
shy
and
tremulous
as
a
girl
of
fifteen
she
blushed
crimson
if
any
one
appealed
to
her
opinion
yet
that
tall
graceful
substantial
presence
was
so
imposing
in
its
mildness
that
men
spoke
to
her
with
an
agreeable
sensation
of
timidity
soothing
unspeakable
charm
of
gentle
womanhood
which
supersedes
all
acquisitions
all
accomplishments
you
would
never
have
asked
at
any
period
of
amos
barton
life
if
she
sketched
or
played
the
piano
you
would
even
perhaps
have
been
rather
scandalized
if
she
had
descended
from
the
serene
dignity
of
to
the
assiduous
unrest
of
happy
the
man
you
would
have
thought
whose
eye
will
rest
on
her
in
the
pauses
of
his
fireside
reading
whose
hot
aching
forehead
will
be
soothed
by
the
contact
of
her
cool
soft
hand
who
will
recover
himself
from
dejection
at
his
mistakes
and
failures
in
the
loving
light
of
her
unreproaching
eyes
you
would
not
perhaps
have
anticipated
that
this
bliss
would
fall
to
the
share
of
precisely
such
a
man
as
amos
barton
whom
you
have
already
surmised
not
to
have
the
refined
sensibilities
for
which
you
might
have
imagined
barton
qualities
to
be
destined
by
harmony
but
i
for
one
do
not
grudge
amos
barton
this
sweet
wife
i
have
all
my
life
had
a
sympathy
for
mongrel
ungainly
dogs
who
are
nobody
pets
and
i
would
rather
surprise
one
of
them
by
a
pat
and
a
pleasant
morsel
than
meet
the
condescending
advances
of
the
loveliest
who
has
his
cushion
by
my
lady
chair
that
to
be
sure
is
not
the
way
of
the
world
if
it
happens
to
see
a
fellow
of
fine
proportions
and
aristocratic
mien
who
makes
no
and
wins
golden
opinions
from
all
sorts
of
men
it
straightway
picks
out
for
him
the
loveliest
of
unmarried
women
and
says
would
be
a
proper
match
not
at
all
say
i
let
that
successful
discreet
and
able
gentleman
put
up
with
something
less
than
the
best
in
the
matrimonial
department
and
let
the
sweet
woman
go
to
make
sunshine
and
a
soft
pillow
for
the
poor
devil
whose
legs
are
not
models
whose
efforts
are
often
blunders
and
who
in
general
gets
more
kicks
than
halfpence
she
the
sweet
woman
will
like
it
as
well
for
her
sublime
capacity
of
loving
will
have
all
the
more
scope
and
i
venture
to
say
nature
would
never
have
grown
half
so
angelic
if
she
had
married
the
man
you
would
perhaps
have
had
in
your
eye
for
her
a
man
with
sufficient
income
and
abundant
personal
eclat
besides
amos
was
an
affectionate
husband
and
in
his
way
valued
his
wife
as
his
best
treasure
but
now
he
has
shut
the
door
behind
him
and
said
milly
dear
was
the
corresponding
greeting
made
eloquent
by
a
smile
that
young
rascal
wo
go
to
sleep
ca
you
give
him
to
nanny
nanny
has
been
busy
ironing
this
evening
but
i
think
i
take
him
to
her
now
and
barton
glided
towards
the
kitchen
while
her
husband
ran
to
put
on
his
in
which
costume
he
was
quietly
filling
his
long
pipe
when
his
wife
returned
to
the
maize
is
a
colour
that
decidedly
did
suit
his
complexion
and
it
is
one
that
soon
soils
why
then
did
barton
select
it
for
domestic
wear
perhaps
because
he
had
a
knack
of
hitting
on
the
wrong
thing
in
garb
as
well
as
in
grammar
barton
now
lighted
her
candle
and
seated
herself
before
her
heap
of
stockings
she
had
something
disagreeable
to
tell
her
husband
but
she
would
not
enter
on
it
at
once
you
had
a
nice
evening
dear
pretty
well
ely
was
there
to
dinner
but
went
away
rather
early
miss
arabella
is
setting
her
cap
at
him
with
a
vengeance
but
i
think
he
much
smitten
i
a
notion
ely
engaged
to
some
one
at
a
distance
and
will
astonish
all
the
ladies
who
are
languishing
for
him
here
by
bringing
home
his
bride
one
of
these
days
ely
a
sly
dog
he
like
that
the
farquhars
say
anything
about
the
singing
last
sunday
farquhar
said
he
thought
it
was
time
there
was
some
improvement
in
the
choir
but
he
was
rather
scandalized
at
my
setting
the
tune
of
lydia
he
says
he
always
hearing
it
as
he
passes
the
independent
meeting
here
barton
laughed
he
had
a
way
of
laughing
at
criticisms
that
other
people
thought
damaging
and
thereby
showed
the
remainder
of
a
set
of
teeth
which
like
the
remnants
of
the
old
guard
were
few
in
number
and
very
much
the
worse
for
wear
he
continued
farquhar
talked
the
most
about
bridmain
and
the
countess
she
has
taken
up
all
the
gossip
about
them
and
wanted
to
convert
me
to
her
opinion
but
i
told
her
pretty
strongly
what
i
thought
me
why
will
people
take
so
much
pains
to
find
out
evil
about
others
i
have
had
a
note
from
the
countess
since
you
went
asking
us
to
dine
with
them
on
friday
here
barton
reached
the
note
from
the
mantelpiece
and
gave
it
to
her
husband
we
will
look
over
his
shoulder
while
he
reads
it
sweetest
milly
bring
your
lovely
face
with
your
husband
to
dine
with
us
on
friday
at
seven
do
if
not
i
will
be
sulky
with
you
till
sunday
when
i
shall
be
obliged
to
see
you
and
shall
long
to
kiss
you
that
very
moment
yours
according
to
your
answer
caroline
czerlaski
like
her
is
it
said
barton
suppose
we
can
go
i
have
no
engagement
the
clerical
meeting
is
tomorrow
you
know
dear
woods
the
butcher
called
to
say
he
must
have
some
money
next
week
he
has
a
payment
to
make
up
this
announcement
made
barton
thoughtful
he
puffed
more
rapidly
and
looked
at
the
fire
think
i
must
ask
hackit
to
lend
me
twenty
pounds
for
it
is
nearly
two
months
till
and
we
ca
give
woods
our
last
shilling
hardly
like
you
to
ask
hackit
dear
he
and
hackit
have
been
so
very
kind
to
us
they
have
sent
us
so
many
things
lately
i
must
ask
oldinport
i
going
to
write
to
him
tomorrow
morning
for
to
tell
him
the
arrangement
i
been
thinking
of
about
having
service
in
the
workhouse
while
the
church
is
being
enlarged
if
he
agrees
to
attend
service
there
once
or
twice
the
other
people
will
come
net
the
large
fish
and
you
sure
to
have
the
small
fry
wish
we
could
do
without
borrowing
money
and
yet
i
do
see
how
we
can
poor
fred
must
have
some
new
shoes
i
could
let
him
go
to
mrs
bond
yesterday
because
his
toes
were
peeping
out
dear
child
and
i
ca
let
him
walk
anywhere
except
in
the
garden
he
must
have
a
pair
before
sunday
really
boots
and
shoes
are
the
greatest
trouble
of
my
life
everything
else
one
can
turn
and
turn
about
and
make
old
look
like
new
but
there
no
coaxing
boots
and
shoes
to
look
better
than
they
are
barton
was
playfully
undervaluing
her
skill
in
metamorphosing
boots
and
shoes
she
had
at
that
moment
on
her
feet
a
pair
of
slippers
which
had
long
ago
lived
through
the
prunella
phase
of
their
existence
and
were
now
running
a
respectable
career
as
black
silk
slippers
having
been
neatly
covered
with
that
material
by
barton
own
neat
fingers
wonderful
fingers
those
they
were
never
empty
for
if
she
went
to
spend
a
few
hours
with
a
friendly
parishioner
out
came
her
thimble
and
a
piece
of
calico
or
muslin
which
before
she
left
had
become
a
mysterious
little
garment
with
all
sorts
of
hemmed
ins
and
outs
she
was
even
trying
to
persuade
her
husband
to
leave
off
tight
pantaloons
because
if
he
would
wear
the
ordinary
she
knew
she
could
make
them
so
well
that
no
one
would
suspect
the
sex
of
the
tailor
but
by
this
time
barton
has
finished
his
pipe
the
candle
begins
to
burn
low
and
barton
goes
to
see
if
nanny
has
succeeded
in
lulling
walter
to
sleep
nanny
is
that
moment
putting
him
in
the
little
cot
by
his
mother
bedside
the
head
with
its
thin
wavelets
of
brown
hair
indents
the
little
pillow
and
a
tiny
waxen
dimpled
fist
hides
the
rosy
lips
for
baby
is
given
to
the
infantile
peccadillo
of
so
nanny
could
now
join
in
the
short
evening
prayer
and
all
could
go
to
bed
barton
carried
the
remainder
of
her
heap
of
stockings
and
laid
them
on
a
table
close
to
her
bedside
where
also
she
placed
a
warm
shawl
removing
her
candle
before
she
put
it
out
to
a
tin
socket
fixed
at
the
head
of
her
bed
her
body
was
very
weary
but
her
heart
was
not
heavy
in
spite
of
woods
the
butcher
and
the
transitory
nature
of
for
her
heart
so
overflowed
with
love
she
felt
sure
she
was
near
a
fountain
of
love
that
would
care
for
husband
and
babes
better
than
she
could
foresee
so
she
was
soon
asleep
but
about
five
in
the
morning
if
there
were
any
angels
watching
round
her
bed
and
angels
might
be
glad
of
such
an
office
they
saw
barton
rise
up
quietly
careful
not
to
disturb
the
slumbering
amos
who
was
snoring
the
snore
of
the
just
light
her
candle
prop
herself
upright
with
the
pillows
throw
the
warm
shawl
round
her
shoulders
and
renew
her
attack
on
the
heap
of
undarned
stockings
she
darned
away
until
she
heard
nanny
stirring
and
then
drowsiness
came
with
the
dawn
the
candle
was
put
out
and
she
sank
into
a
doze
but
at
nine
she
was
at
the
busy
cutting
for
five
hungry
mouths
while
nanny
baby
on
one
arm
in
rosy
cheeks
fat
neck
and
brought
in
a
jug
of
hot
nearest
her
mother
sits
the
patty
the
eldest
child
whose
sweet
fair
face
is
already
rather
grave
sometimes
and
who
always
wants
to
run
to
save
mamma
legs
which
get
so
tired
of
an
evening
then
there
are
four
other
blond
heads
two
boys
and
two
girls
gradually
decreasing
in
size
down
to
chubby
who
is
making
a
round
o
of
her
mouth
to
receive
a
bit
of
papa
papa
attention
was
divided
between
petting
chubby
rebuking
the
noisy
fred
which
he
did
with
a
somewhat
excessive
sharpness
and
eating
his
own
breakfast
he
had
not
yet
looked
at
mamma
and
did
not
know
that
her
cheek
was
paler
than
usual
but
patty
whispered
have
you
the
headache
happily
coal
was
cheap
in
the
neighbourhood
of
shepperton
and
hackit
would
any
time
let
his
horses
draw
a
load

there
was
a

in

not

they
looked

breakfast
over
barton
mounted
to
his
study
and
occupied
himself
in
the
first
place
with
his
letter
to
oldinport
it
was
very
much
the
same
sort
of
letter
as
most
clergymen
would
have
written
under
the
same
circumstances
except
that
instead
of
perambulate
the
rev
amos
wrote
preambulate
and
instead
of
haply
happily
the
contingency
indicated
being
the
reverse
of
happy
barton
had
not
the
gift
of
perfect
accuracy
in
english
orthography
and
syntax
which
was
unfortunate
as
he
was
known
not
to
be
a
hebrew
scholar
and
not
in
the
least
suspected
of
being
an
accomplished
grecian
these
lapses
in
a
man
who
had
gone
through
the
eleusinian
mysteries
of
a
university
education
surprised
the
young
ladies
of
his
parish
extremely
especially
the
misses
farquhar
whom
he
had
once
addressed
in
a
letter
as
dear
apparently
an
abbreviation
for
madams
the
persons
least
surprised
at
the
rev
amos
deficiencies
were
his
clerical
brethren
who
had
gone
through
the
mysteries
themselves
at
eleven
barton
walked
forth
in
cape
and
boa
with
the
sleet
driving
in
his
face
to
read
prayers
at
the
workhouse
euphemistically
called
the
the
college
was
a
huge
square
stone
building
standing
on
the
best
apology
for
an
elevation
of
ground
that
could
be
seen
for
about
ten
miles
around
shepperton
a
flat
ugly
district
this
depressing
enough
to
look
at
even
on
the
brightest
days
the
roads
are
black
with
the
brick
houses
dingy
with
smoke
and
at
that
time
the
time
of
handloom
weavers
every
other
cottage
had
a
loom
at
its
window
where
you
might
see
a
pale
man
or
woman
pressing
a
narrow
chest
against
a
board
and
doing
a
sort
of
treadmill
work
with
legs
and
arms
a
troublesome
district
for
a
clergyman
at
least
to
one
who
like
amos
barton
understood
the
of
souls
in
something
more
than
an
official
sense
for
over
and
above
the
rustic
stupidity
furnished
by
the
the
miners
brought
obstreperous
animalism
and
the
weavers
in
an
acrid
radicalism
and
dissent
indeed
hackit
often
observed
that
the
colliers
who
many
of
them
earned
better
wages
than
barton
their
time
in
doing
nothing
but
swilling
ale
and
smoking
like
the
beasts
that
perish
speaking
we
may
presume
in
a
remotely
analogical
sense
and
in
some
of
the
alehouse
corners
the
drink
was
flavoured
by
a
dingy
kind
of
infidelity
something
like
rinsings
of
tom
paine
in
a
certain
amount
of
religious
excitement
created
by
the
popular
preaching
of
parry
amos
predecessor
had
nearly
died
out
and
the
religious
life
of
shepperton
was
falling
back
towards
mark
here
you
perceive
was
a
terrible
stronghold
of
satan
and
you
may
well
pity
the
rev
amos
barton
who
had
to
stand
and
summon
it
to
surrender
we
read
indeed
that
the
walls
of
jericho
fell
down
before
the
sound
of
trumpets
but
we
nowhere
hear
that
those
trumpets
were
hoarse
and
feeble
doubtless
they
were
trumpets
that
gave
forth
clear
ringing
tones
and
sent
a
mighty
vibration
through
brick
and
mortar
but
the
oratory
of
the
rev
amos
resembled
rather
a
belgian
which
shows
praiseworthy
intentions
inadequately
fulfilled
he
often
missed
the
right
note
both
in
public
and
private
exhortation
and
got
a
little
angry
in
consequence
for
though
amos
thought
himself
strong
he
did
not
himself
strong
nature
had
given
him
the
opinion
but
not
the
sensation
without
that
opinion
he
would
probably
never
have
worn
cambric
bands
but
would
have
been
an
excellent
cabinetmaker
and
deacon
of
an
independent
church
as
his
father
was
before
him
he
was
not
a
shoemaker
as
pilgrim
had
reported
he
might
then
have
sniffed
long
and
loud
in
the
corner
of
his
pew
in
gun
street
chapel
he
might
have
indulged
in
halting
rhetoric
at
and
have
spoken
faulty
english
in
private
life
and
these
little
infirmities
would
not
have
prevented
him
honest
faithful
man
that
he
was
from
being
a
shining
light
in
the
dissenting
circle
of
bridgeport
a
tallow
dip
of
the
description
is
an
excellent
thing
in
the
kitchen
candlestick
and
betty
nose
and
eye
are
not
sensitive
to
the
difference
between
it
and
the
finest
wax
it
is
only
when
you
stick
it
in
the
silver
candlestick
and
introduce
it
into
the
that
it
seems
plebeian
dim
and
ineffectual
alas
for
the
worthy
man
who
like
that
candle
gets
himself
into
the
wrong
place
it
is
only
the
very
largest
souls
who
will
be
able
to
appreciate
and
pity
him
who
will
discern
and
love
sincerity
of
purpose
amid
all
the
bungling
feebleness
of
achievement
but
now
amos
barton
has
made
his
way
through
the
sleet
as
far
as
the
college
has
thrown
off
his
hat
cape
and
boa
and
is
reading
in
the
dreary
a
portion
of
the
morning
service
to
the
inmates
seated
on
the
benches
before
him
remember
the
new
had
not
yet
come
into
operation
and
barton
was
not
acting
as
paid
chaplain
of
the
union
but
as
the
pastor
who
had
the
cure
of
all
souls
in
his
parish
pauper
as
well
as
other
after
the
prayers
he
always
addressed
to
them
a
short
discourse
on
some
subject
suggested
by
the
lesson
for
the
day
striving
if
by
this
means
some
edifying
matter
might
find
its
way
into
the
pauper
mind
and
conscience
perhaps
a
task
as
trying
as
you
could
well
imagine
to
the
faith
and
patience
of
any
honest
clergyman
for
on
the
very
first
bench
these
were
the
faces
on
which
his
eye
had
to
rest
watching
whether
there
was
any
stirring
under
the
stagnant
surface
right
in
front
of
him
probably
because
he
was
and
it
was
deemed
more
edifying
to
hear
nothing
at
a
short
distance
than
at
a
long
one
sat
maxum
as
he
was
familiarly
called
his
real
patronymic
remaining
a
mystery
to
most
persons
a
fine
philological
sense
discerns
in
this
cognomen
an
indication
that
the
pauper
patriarch
had
once
been
considered
pithy
and
sententious
in
his
speech
but
now
the
weight
of
years
lay
heavy
on
his
tongue
as
well
as
in
his
ears
and
he
sat
before
the
clergyman
with
protruded
chin
and
munching
mouth
and
eyes
that
seemed
to
look
at
emptiness
next
to
him
sat
poll
fodge
known
to
the
magistracy
of
her
county
as
mary
higgins
a
woman
with
a
scarred
and
seamy
face
the
most
notorious
rebel
in
the
workhouse
said
to
have
once
thrown
her
broth
over
the
master
and
who
in
spite
of
nature
apparent
safeguards
against
that
contingency
had
contributed
to
the
perpetuation
of
the
fodge
characteristics
in
the
person
of
a
small
boy
who
was
behaving
naughtily
on
one
of
the
back
benches
miss
fodge
fixed
her
one
sore
eye
on
barton
with
a
sort
of
hardy
defiance
beyond
this
member
of
the
softer
sex
at
the
end
of
the
bench
sat
jim
a
young
man
afflicted
with
hydrocephalus
who
rolled
his
head
from
side
to
side
and
gazed
at
the
point
of
his
nose
these
were
the
supporters
of
old
maxum
on
his
right
on
his
left
sat
fitchett
a
tall
fellow
who
had
once
been
a
footman
in
the
oldinport
family
and
in
that
giddy
elevation
had
enunciated
a
contemptuous
opinion
of
boiled
beef
which
had
been
traditionally
handed
down
in
shepperton
as
the
direct
cause
of
his
ultimate
reduction
to
pauper
commons
his
calves
were
now
shrunken
and
his
hair
was
grey
without
the
aid
of
powder
but
he
still
carried
his
chin
as
if
he
were
conscious
of
a
stiff
cravat
he
set
his
dilapidated
hat
on
with
a
knowing
inclination
towards
the
left
ear
and
when
he
was
on
he
carted
and
uncarted
the
manure
with
a
sort
of
flunkey
grace
the
ghost
of
that
jaunty
demeanour
with
which
he
used
to
usher
in
my
lady
morning
visitors
the
flunkey
nature
was
nowhere
completely
subdued
but
in
his
stomach
and
he
still
divided
society
into
gentry
gentry
flunkeys
and
the
people
who
provided
for
them
a
clergyman
without
a
flunkey
was
an
anomaly
belonging
to
neither
of
these
classes
fitchett
had
an
irrepressible
tendency
to
drowsiness
under
spiritual
instruction
and
in
the
recurrent
regularity
with
which
he
dozed
off
until
he
nodded
and
awaked
himself
he
looked
not
unlike
a
piece
of
mechanism
ingeniously
contrived
for
measuring
the
length
of
barton
discourse
perfectly
on
the
contrary
was
his
neighbour
mrs
brick
one
of
those
hard
undying
old
women
to
whom
age
seems
to
have
given
a
network
of
wrinkles
as
a
coat
of
magic
armour
against
the
attacks
of
winters
warm
or
cold
the
point
on
which
mrs
brick
was
still
sensitive
the
theme
on
which
you
might
possibly
excite
her
hope
and
fear
was
snuff
it
seemed
to
be
an
embalming
powder
helping
her
soul
to
do
the
office
of
salt
and
now
eke
out
an
audience
of
which
this
front
benchful
was
a
sample
with
a
certain
number
of
refractory
children
over
whom
spratt
the
master
of
the
workhouse
exercised
an
irate
surveillance
and
i
think
you
will
admit
that
the
clergyman
whose
office
it
is
to
bring
home
the
gospel
to
a
handful
of
such
souls
has
a
sufficiently
hard
task
for
to
have
any
chance
of
success
short
of
miraculous
intervention
he
must
bring
his
geographical
chronological
exegetical
mind
pretty
nearly
to
the
pauper
point
of
view
or
of
no
view
he
must
have
some
approximate
conception
of
the
mode
in
which
the
doctrines
that
have
so
much
vitality
in
the
plenum
of
his
own
brain
will
comport
themselves
that
is
to
say
in
a
brain
that
is
neither
geographical
chronological
nor
exegetical
it
is
a
flexible
imagination
that
can
take
such
a
leap
as
that
and
an
adroit
tongue
that
can
adapt
its
speech
to
so
unfamiliar
a
position
the
rev
amos
barton
had
neither
that
flexible
imagination
nor
that
adroit
tongue
he
talked
of
israel
and
its
sins
of
chosen
vessels
of
the
paschal
lamb
of
blood
as
a
medium
of
reconciliation
and
he
strove
in
this
way
to
convey
religious
truth
within
reach
of
the
fodge
and
fitchett
mind
this
very
morning
the
first
lesson
was
the
twelfth
chapter
of
exodus
and
exposition
turned
on
unleavened
bread
nothing
in
the
world
more
suited
to
the
simple
understanding
than
instruction
through
familiar
types
and
symbols
but
there
is
always
this
danger
attending
it
that
the
interest
or
comprehension
of
your
hearers
may
stop
short
precisely
at
the
point
where
your
spiritual
interpretation
begins
and
barton
this
morning
succeeded
in
carrying
the
pauper
imagination
to
the
but
unfortunately
was
not
able
to
carry
it
upwards
from
that
object
to
the
unknown
truths
which
it
was
intended
to
shadow
forth
alas
a
natural
incapacity
for
teaching
finished
by
keeping
at
cambridge
where
there
are
able
mathematicians
and
butter
is
sold
by
the
yard
is
not
apparently
the
medium
through
which
christian
doctrine
will
distil
as
welcome
dew
on
withered
souls
and
so
while
the
sleet
outside
was
turning
to
unquestionable
snow
and
the
stony
looked
darker
and
drearier
and
fitchett
was
nodding
his
lowest
and
spratt
was
boxing
the
boys
ears
with
a
constant
as
he
felt
more
keenly
the
approach
of
barton
wound
up
his
exhortation
with
something
of
the
february
chill
at
his
heart
as
well
as
his
feet
fitchett
thoroughly
roused
now
the
instruction
was
at
an
end
obsequiously
and
gracefully
advanced
to
help
barton
in
putting
on
his
cape
while
mrs
brick
rubbed
her
withered
forefinger
round
and
round
her
little
vainly
seeking
for
the
fraction
of
a
pinch
i
ca
help
thinking
that
if
barton
had
shaken
into
that
little
box
a
small
portion
of
scotch
he
might
have
produced
something
more
like
an
amiable
emotion
in
mrs
brick
mind
than
anything
she
had
felt
under
his
morning
exposition
of
the
unleavened
bread
but
our
good
amos
laboured
under
a
deficiency
of
small
tact
as
well
as
of
small
cash
and
when
he
observed
the
action
of
the
old
woman
forefinger
he
said
in
his
brusque
way
your
snuff
is
all
gone
eh
mrs
brick
eyes
twinkled
with
the
visionary
hope
that
the
parson
might
be
intending
to
replenish
her
box
at
least
mediately
through
the
present
of
a
small
copper
well
you
soon
be
going
where
there
is
no
more
snuff
you
be
in
need
of
mercy
then
you
must
remember
that
you
may
have
to
seek
for
mercy
and
not
find
it
just
as
you
seeking
for
snuff
at
the
first
sentence
of
this
admonition
the
twinkle
subsided
from
mrs
brick
eyes
the
lid
of
her
box
went
and
her
heart
was
shut
up
at
the
same
moment
but
now
barton
attention
was
called
for
by
spratt
who
was
dragging
a
small
and
unwilling
boy
from
the
rear
spratt
was
a
man
with
a
remarkable
power
of
language
mitigated
by
hesitation
who
piqued
himself
on
expressing
unexceptionable
sentiments
in
unexceptional
language
on
all
occasions
barton
sir
aw
aw
excuse
my
trespassing
on
your
time
aw
to
beg
that
you
will
administer
a
rebuke
to
this
boy
he
is
aw
aw
most
inveterate
in
during
the
inveterate
culprit
was
a
boy
of
seven
vainly
contending
against
at
his
nose
by
feeble
sniffing
but
no
sooner
had
spratt
uttered
his
impeachment
than
miss
fodge
rushed
forward
and
placed
herself
between
barton
and
the
accused
child
muster
barton
she
exclaimed
further
manifesting
her
maternal
instincts
by
applying
her
apron
to
her
offspring
nose
faut
wi
him
and
him
for
nothin
let
him
goo
an
eat
his
roost
goose
as
is
up
in
our
noses
while
we
them
greasy
broth
an
let
my
boy
alooan
spratt
small
eyes
flashed
and
he
was
in
danger
of
uttering
sentiments
not
unexceptionable
before
the
clergyman
but
barton
foreseeing
that
a
prolongation
of
this
episode
would
not
be
to
edification
said
in
his
severest
tones
me
hear
no
abuse
your
boy
is
not
likely
to
behave
well
if
you
set
him
the
example
of
being
saucy
then
stooping
down
to
master
fodge
and
taking
him
by
the
shoulder
you
like
being
beaten
what
a
silly
boy
you
are
to
be
naughty
if
you
were
not
naughty
you
would
be
beaten
but
if
you
are
naughty
god
will
be
angry
as
well
as
spratt
and
god
can
burn
you
for
ever
that
will
be
worse
than
being
beaten
master
fodge
countenance
was
neither
affirmative
nor
negative
of
this
proposition
continued
barton
you
will
be
a
good
boy
god
will
love
you
and
you
will
grow
up
to
be
a
good
man
now
let
me
hear
next
thursday
that
you
have
been
a
good
boy
master
fodge
had
no
distinct
vision
of
the
benefit
that
would
accrue
to
him
from
this
change
of
courses
but
barton
being
aware
that
miss
fodge
had
touched
on
a
delicate
subject
in
alluding
to
the
roast
goose
was
determined
to
witness
no
more
polemics
between
her
and
spratt
so
saying
good
morning
to
the
latter
he
hastily
left
the
college
the
snow
was
falling
in
thicker
and
thicker
flakes
and
already
the
was
cloaked
in
white
as
he
passed
through
the
gate
barton
heard
him
open
the
door
and
ran
out
of
the
to
meet
him
afraid
your
feet
are
very
wet
dear
what
a
terrible
morning
let
me
take
your
hat
your
slippers
are
at
the
fire
barton
was
feeling
a
little
cold
and
cross
it
is
difficult
when
you
have
been
doing
disagreeable
duties
without
praise
on
a
snowy
day
to
attend
to
the
very
minor
morals
so
he
showed
no
recognition
of
attentions
but
simply
said
me
my
will
you
is
down
dear
i
thought
you
would
go
into
the
study
because
you
said
you
would
letter
and
number
the
books
for
the
lending

boots

put
his
feet

the
slippers

brought
him

put
them

into
the
parlour
the
was
also
the
day
nursery
and
schoolroom
and
while
mamma
back
was
turned
dickey
the
second
boy
had
insisted
on
superseding
chubby
in
the
guidance
of
a
headless
horse
of
the
species
which
she
was
drawing
round
the
room
so
that
when
papa
opened
the
door
chubby
was
giving
tongue
energetically
some
of
these
children

go
away

want
to
be

sophy
and
dickey
help
me
to
carry
these
books
into
the
parlour
there
are
three
for
dickey
carry
them
steadily
papa
meanwhile
settled
himself
in
his
and
took
up
a
work
on
episcopacy
which
he
had
from
the
clerical
book
society
thinking
he
would
finish
it
and
return
it
this
afternoon
as
he
was
going
to
the
clerical
meeting
at
milby
vicarage
where
the
book
society
had
its
headquarters
the
clerical
meetings
and
book
society
which
had
been
founded
some
eight
or
ten
months
had
had
a
noticeable
effect
on
the
rev
amos
barton
when
he
first
came
to
shepperton
he
was
simply
an
evangelical
clergyman
whose
christian
experiences
had
commenced
under
the
teaching
of
the
rev
johns
of
gun
street
chapel
and
had
been
consolidated
at
cambridge
under
the
influence
of
simeon
john
newton
and
thomas
scott
were
his
doctrinal
ideals
he
would
have
taken
in
the
christian
observer
and
the
record
if
he
could
have
afforded
it
his
anecdotes
were
chiefly
of
the
kind
current
in
dissenting
circles
and
he
thought
an
episcopalian
establishment
unobjectionable
but
by
this
time
the
effect
of
the
tractarian
agitation
was
beginning
to
be
felt
in
backward
provincial
regions
and
the
tractarian
satire
on
the
party
was
beginning
to
tell
even
on
those
who
disavowed
or
resisted
tractarian
doctrines
the
vibration
of
an
intellectual
movement
was
felt
from
the
golden
head
to
the
miry
toes
of
the
establishment
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
district
round
milby
the
close
to
shepperton
the
clergy
had
agreed
to
have
a
clerical
meeting
every
month
wherein
they
would
exercise
their
intellects
by
discussing
theological
and
ecclesiastical
questions
and
cement
their
brotherly
love
by
discussing
a
good
dinner
a
book
society
naturally
suggested
itself
as
an
adjunct
of
this
agreeable
plan
and
thus
you
perceive
there
was
provision
made
for
ample
friction
of
the
clerical
mind
now
the
rev
amos
barton
was
one
of
those
men
who
have
a
decided
will
and
opinion
of
their
own
he
held
himself
bolt
upright
and
had
no
he
would
march
very
determinedly
along
the
road
he
thought
best
but
then
it
was
wonderfully
easy
to
convince
him
which
was
the
best
road
and
so
a
very
little
unwonted
reading
and
unwonted
discussion
made
him
see
that
an
episcopalian
establishment
was
much
more
than
unobjectionable
and
on
many
other
points
he
began
to
feel
that
he
held
opinions
a
little
too
and
profound
to
be
crudely
and
suddenly
communicated
to
ordinary
minds
he
was
like
an
onion
that
has
been
rubbed
with
spices
the
strong
original
odour
was
blended
with
something
new
and
foreign
the
onion
still
offended
refined
high
church
nostrils
and
the
new
spice
was
unwelcome
to
the
palate
of
the
genuine
we
will
not
accompany
him
to
the
clerical
meeting
today
because
we
shall
probably
want
to
go
thither
some
day
when
he
will
be
absent
and
just
now
i
am
bent
on
introducing
you
to
bridmain
and
the
countess
czerlaski
with
whom
and
barton
are
invited
to
dine
tomorrow
chapter
outside
the
moon
is
shedding
its
cold
light
on
the
cold
snow
and
the
round
camp
villa
are
casting
a
blue
shadow
across
the
white
ground
while
the
rev
amos
barton
and
his
wife
are
audibly
crushing
the
crisp
snow
beneath
their
feet
as
about
seven
on
friday
evening
they
approach
the
door
of
the
desirable
country
residence
containing
dining
breakfast
and
drawing
rooms
situated
only
half
a
mile
from
the
of
milby
inside
there
is
a
bright
fire
in
the
casting
a
pleasant
but
uncertain
light
on
the
delicate
silk
dress
of
a
lady
who
is
reclining
behind
a
screen
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
and
allowing
you
to
discern
that
the
hair
of
the
gentleman
who
is
seated
in
the
opposite
with
a
newspaper
over
his
knees
is
becoming
decidedly
grey
a
little
charles
with
a
crimson
ribbon
round
his
neck
who
has
been
lying
curled
up
in
the
very
middle
of
the
has
just
discovered
that
that
zone
is
too
hot
for
him
and
is
jumping
on
the
sofa
evidently
with
the
intention
of
accommodating
his
person
on
the
silk
gown
on
the
table
there
are
two
which
will
be
lighted
as
soon
as
the
expected
knock
is
heard
at
the
door
the
knock
is
heard
the
candles
are
lighted
and
presently
and
barton
are
ushered
in
barton
erect
and
clerical
in
a
faultless
tie
and
shining
cranium
barton
graceful
in
a
black
silk
this
is
charming
of
you
said
the
countess
czerlaski
advancing
to
meet
them
and
embracing
milly
with
careful
elegance
am
really
ashamed
of
my
selfishness
in
asking
my
friends
to
come
and
see
me
in
this
frightful
weather
then
giving
her
hand
to
amos
you
barton
whose
time
is
so
precious
but
i
am
doing
a
good
deed
in
drawing
you
away
from
your
labours
i
have
a
plot
to
prevent
you
from
martyrizing
yourself
while
this
greeting
was
going
forward
bridmain
and
jet
the
spaniel
looked
on
with
the
air
of
actors
who
had
no
idea
of
bridmain
a
stiff
and
rather
man
gave
his
welcome
with
a
laboured
cordiality
it
was
astonishing
how
very
little
he
resembled
his
beautiful
sister
for
the
countess
czerlaski
was
undeniably
beautiful
as
she
seated
herself
by
barton
on
the
sofa
milly
eyes
indeed
rested
must
it
be
confessed
chiefly
on
the
details
of
the
tasteful
dress
the
rich
silk
of
a
pinkish
lilac
hue
the
countess
always
wore
delicate
colours
in
an
evening
the
black
lace
pelerine
and
the
black
lace
veil
falling
at
the
back
of
the
small
head
for
milly
had
one
weakness
do
love
her
any
the
less
for
it
it
was
a
pretty
weakness
she
was
fond
of
dress
and
often
when
she
was
making
up
her
own
economical
millinery
she
had
romantic
visions
how
nice
it
would
be
to
put
on
really
handsome
stylish
things
to
have
very
stiff
balloon
sleeves
for
example
without
which
a
woman
dress
was
nought
in
those
days
you
and
i
too
reader
have
our
weakness
have
we
not
which
makes
us
think
foolish
things
now
and
then
perhaps
it
may
lie
in
an
excessive
admiration
for
small
hands
and
feet
a
tall
lithe
figure
large
dark
eyes
and
dark
silken
braided
hair
all
these
the
countess
possessed
and
she
had
moreover
a
nose
the
least
bit
curved
and
a
clear
brunette
complexion
her
mouth
it
must
be
admitted
receded
too
much
from
her
nose
and
chin
and
to
a
prophetic
eye
threatened
in
advanced
age
but
by
the
light
of
fire
and
wax
candles
that
age
seemed
very
far
off
indeed
and
you
would
have
said
that
the
countess
was
not
more
than
thirty
look
at
the
two
women
on
the
sofa
together
the
large
fair
milly
is
timid
even
in
friendship
it
is
not
easy
to
her
to
speak
of
the
affection
of
which
her
heart
is
full
the
lithe
dark
countess
is
racking
her
small
brain
for
caressing
words
and
charming
exaggerations
how
are
all
the
cherubs
at
home
said
the
countess
stooping
to
pick
up
jet
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
have
been
kept
by
a
cold
ever
since
sunday
or
i
should
not
have
rested
without
seeing
you
what
have
you
done
with
those
wretched
singers
mr
barton
we
have
got
a
new
choir
together
which
will
go
on
very
well
with
a
little
practice
i
was
quite
determined
that
the
old
set
of
singers
should
be
dismissed
i
had
given
orders
that
they
should
not
sing
the
wedding
psalm
as
they
call
it
again
to
make
a
couple
look
ridiculous
and
they
sang
it
in
defiance
of
me
i
could
put
them
into
the
ecclesiastical
court
if
i
chose
for
to
do
so
for
lifting
up
their
voices
in
church
in
opposition
to
the
clergyman
a
most
wholesome
discipline
that
would
be
said
the
countess
you
are
too
patient
and
forbearing
barton
for
my
part
lose
temper
when
i
see
how
far
you
are
from
being
appreciated
in
that
miserable
shepperton
if
as
is
probable
barton
felt
at
a
loss
what
to
say
in
reply
to
the
insinuated
compliment
it
was
a
relief
to
him
that
dinner
was
announced
just
then
and
that
he
had
to
offer
his
arm
to
the
countess
as
bridmain
was
leading
barton
to
the
he
observed
weather
is
very
severe
indeed
said
milly
bridmain
studied
conversation
as
an
art
to
ladies
he
spoke
of
the
weather
and
was
accustomed
to
consider
it
under
three
points
of
view
as
a
question
of
climate
in
general
comparing
england
with
other
countries
in
this
respect
as
a
personal
question
inquiring
how
it
affected
his
lady
interlocutor
in
particular
and
as
a
question
of
probabilities
discussing
whether
there
would
be
a
change
or
a
continuance
of
the
present
atmospheric
conditions
to
gentlemen
he
talked
politics
and
he
read
two
daily
papers
expressly
to
qualify
himself
for
this
function
barton
thought
him
a
man
of
considerable
political
information
but
not
of
lively
parts
so
you
are
always
to
hold
your
clerical
meetings
at
mr
ely
said
the
countess
between
her
spoonfuls
of
soup
the
soup
was
a
little
short
of
camp
villa
who
was
in
the
habit
of
letting
her
best
apartments
gave
only
moderate
wages
to
her
cook
said
barton
is
a
central
place
and
there
are
many
conveniences
in
having
only
one
point
of
meeting
continued
the
countess
one
seems
to
agree
in
giving
the
precedence
to
ely
for
my
part
i
admire
him
his
preaching
is
too
cold
for
me
it
has
no
fervour
no
heart
i
often
say
to
my
brother
it
is
a
great
comfort
to
me
that
shepperton
church
is
not
too
far
off
for
us
to
go
to
do
i
edmund
answered
bridmain
show
us
into
such
a
bad
pew
at
milby
just
where
there
is
a
draught
from
that
door
i
caught
a
stiff
neck
the
first
time
i
went
there
it
is
the
cold
in
the
pulpit
that
affects
me
not
the
cold
in
the
pew
i
was
writing
to
my
friend
lady
porter
this
morning
and
telling
her
all
about
my
feelings
she
and
i
think
alike
on
such
matters
she
is
most
anxious
that
when
sir
william
has
an
opportunity
of
giving
away
the
living
at
their
place
dippley
they
should
have
a
thoroughly
zealous
clever
man
there
i
have
been
describing
a
certain
friend
of
mine
to
her
who
i
think
would
be
just
to
her
mind
and
there
is
such
a
pretty
rectory
milly
should
i
like
to
see
you
the
mistress
of
it
milly
smiled
and
blushed
slightly
the
rev
amos
blushed
very
red
and
gave
a
little
embarrassed
laugh
he
could
rarely
keep
his
muscles
within
the
limits
of
a
smile
at
this
moment
john
the
approached
barton
with
a
and
also
with
a
slight
odour
of
the
stable
which
usually
adhered
to
him
through
his
functions
john
was
rather
nervous
and
the
countess
happening
to
speak
to
him
at
this
inopportune
moment
the
tureen
slipped
and
emptied
itself
on
barton
black
silk
horror
tell
alice
to
come
directly
and
rub
barton
dress
said
the
countess
to
the
trembling
john
carefully
abstaining
from
approaching
the
spot
on
the
floor
with
her
own
lilac
silk
but
bridmain
who
had
a
strictly
private
interest
in
silks
jumped
up
and
applied
his
napkin
at
once
to
gown
milly
felt
a
little
inward
anguish
but
no
and
tried
to
make
light
of
the
matter
for
the
sake
of
john
as
well
as
others
the
countess
felt
inwardly
thankful
that
her
own
delicate
silk
had
escaped
but
threw
out
lavish
interjections
of
distress
and
indignation
saint
that
you
are
she
said
when
milly
laughed
and
suggested
that
as
her
silk
was
not
very
glossy
to
begin
with
the
dim
patch
would
not
be
much
seen
do
mind
about
these
things
i
know
just
the
same
sort
of
thing
happened
to
me
at
the
princess
wengstein
one
day
on
a
pink
satin
i
was
in
an
agony
but
you
are
so
indifferent
to
dress
and
well
you
may
be
it
is
you
who
make
dress
pretty
and
not
dress
that
makes
you
pretty
alice
the
buxom
wearing
a
much
better
dress
than
barton
now
appeared
to
take
bridmain
place
in
retrieving
the
mischief
and
after
a
great
amount
of
supplementary
rubbing
composure
was
restored
and
the
business
of
dining
was
continued
when
john
was
recounting
his
accident
to
the
cook
in
the
kitchen
he
observed
barton
a
hamable
woman
i
a
deal
sooner
ha
throwed
the
gravy
the
countess
fine
gownd
but
laws
what
tantrums
she
ha
been
in
arter
the
visitors
was
gone
a
deal
sooner
not
ha
throwed
it
down
at
all
should
think
responded
the
unsympathetic
cook
to
whom
john
did
make
love
think
to
mek
gravy
anuff
if
you
to
baste
people
gownds
it
suggested
john
humbly
should
wet
the
bottom
of
the
a
bit
to
hold
it
from
slippin
your
granny
returned
the
cook
a
retort
which
she
probably
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
ad
and
which
in
fact
reduced
john
to
silence
later
on
in
the
evening
while
john
was
removing
the
tea
things
from
the
and
brushing
the
crumbs
from
the
with
an
accompanying
hiss
such
as
he
was
wont
to
encourage
himself
with
in
rubbing
down
bridmain
horse
the
rev
amos
barton
drew
from
his
pocket
a
thin
pamphlet
and
presenting
it
to
the
countess
said
were
pleased
i
think
with
my
sermon
on
christmas
day
it
has
been
printed
in
the
pulpit
and
i
thought
you
might
like
a
copy
indeed
i
shall
i
shall
quite
value
the
opportunity
of
reading
that
sermon
there
was
such
depth
in
it
such
argument
it
was
not
a
sermon
to
be
heard
only
once
i
am
delighted
that
it
should
become
generally
known
as
it
will
be
now
it
is
printed
in
the
pulpit
said
milly
innocently
was
so
pleased
with
the
letter
and
she
drew
out
her
little
where
she
carefully
treasured
the
editorial
autograph
while
barton
laughed
and
blushed
and
said
milly
see
she
said
giving
the
letter
to
the
countess
am
very
proud
of
the
praise
my
husband
gets
the
sermon
in
question
by
the
by
was
an
extremely
argumentative
one
on
the
incarnation
which
as
it
was
preached
to
a
congregation
not
one
of
whom
had
any
doubt
of
that
doctrine
and
to
whom
the
socinians
therein
confuted
were
as
unknown
as
the
arimaspians
was
exceedingly
well
adapted
to
trouble
and
confuse
the
sheppertonian
mind
said
the
countess
returning
the
editor
letter
may
well
say
he
will
be
glad
of
other
sermons
from
the
same
source
but
i
would
rather
you
should
publish
your
sermons
in
an
independent
volume
barton
it
would
be
so
desirable
to
have
them
in
that
shape
for
instance
i
could
send
a
copy
to
the
dean
of
radborough
and
there
is
lord
blarney
whom
i
knew
before
he
was
chancellor
i
was
a
special
favourite
of
his
and
you
ca
think
what
sweet
things
he
used
to
say
to
me
i
shall
not
resist
the
temptation
to
write
to
him
one
of
these
days
and
tell
him
how
he
ought
to
dispose
of
the
next

the
spaniel
being
a

more
knowing
dog

wished
to
express
his
disapproval
of
the

last
speech
as
not
accordant
with
his
ideas
of
wisdom
and
veracity
i
can
not
say
but
at
this
moment
he
jumped
off
her

turning
his
back
upon
her
placed
one
paw
on
the
fender
and
held
the
other
up
to
warm
as
if
affecting
to
abstract
himself
from
the
current
of
conversation

now
bridmain
brought
out
the
and
barton
accepted
his
challenge
to
play
a
game
with
immense
satisfaction
the
rev
amos
was
very
fond
of
chess
as
most
people
are
who
can
continue
through
many
years
to
create
interesting
vicissitudes
in
the
game
by
taking
moves
with
their
knights
and
subsequently
discovering
that
they
have
thereby
exposed
their
queen
chess
is
a
silent
game
and
the
countess
chat
with
milly
is
in
quite
an
probably
relating
to
women
matters
that
it
would
be
impertinent
for
us
to
listen
to
so
we
will
leave
camp

and
proceed
to

where
farquhar
has
sat
out
two

he
has
been

at

a

of
by
the

of
milby
and
its
neighbourhood
he
was
regarded
as
a
man
of
quite
remarkable
powers
and
learning
who
must
make
a
considerable
sensation
in
london
pulpits
and
on
his
occasional
visit
to
the
metropolis
and
by
his
brother
clergy
he
was
regarded
as
a
discreet
and
agreeable
fellow
ely
never
got
into
a
warm
discussion
he
suggested
what
might
be
thought
but
rarely
said
what
he
thought
himself
he
never
let
either
men
or
women
see
that
he
was
laughing
at
them
and
he
never
gave
any
one
an
opportunity
of
laughing
at
in
one
thing
only
he
was
injudicious
he
parted
his
dark
wavy
hair
down
the
middle
and
as
his
head
was
rather
flat
than
otherwise
that
style
of
coiffure
was
not
advantageous
to
him
farquhar
though
not
a
parishioner
of
ely
was
one
of
his
warmest
admirers
and
thought
he
would
make

it
must
be
confessed
he
was
getting

nobody

the

pooh
it

on
the
very

of

called
on

now
how
did
you
find
them
mr
bridmain
strikes
me
as
a
common
sort
of
man
who
is
making
an
effort
to
seem
wise
and
he
comes
down
on
one
tremendously
with
political
information
and
seems
knowing
about
the
king
of
the
french
the
countess
is
certainly
a
handsome
woman
but
she
puts
on
the
grand
air
a
little
too
powerfully
woodcock
was
immensely
taken
with
her
and
insisted
on
his
wife
calling
on
her
and
asking
her
to
dinner
but
i
think
woodcock
turned
restive
after
the
first
visit
and
invite
her
again
ha
woodcock
hath
alwayth
a
thoft
place
in

for
a
pretty
fathe
odd
how
he
came
to
marry
that
plain
woman
and
no
fortune
either
of
the
tender
passion
said
ely
am
not
initiated
yet
you
know
here
farquhar
carriage
was
announced
and
as
we
have
not
found
his
conversation
particularly
brilliant
under
the
stimulus
of
exceptional
presence
we
will
not
accompany
him
home
to
the
less
exciting
atmosphere
of
domestic
life
ely
threw
himself
with
a
sense
of
relief
into
his
easiest
chair
set
his
feet
on
the
hobs
and
in
this
attitude
of
bachelor
enjoyment
began
to
read
bishop
jebb
memoirs
chapter
i
am
by
no
means
sure
that
if
the
good
people
of
milby
had
known
the
truth
about
the
countess
czerlaski
they
would
not
have
been
considerably
disappointed
to
find
that
it
was
very
far
from
being
as
bad
as
they
imagined
nice
distinctions
are
troublesome
it
is
so
much
easier
to
say
that
a
thing
is
black
than
to
discriminate
the
particular
shade
of
brown
blue
or
green
to
which
it
really
belongs
it
is
so
much
easier
to
make
up
your
mind
that
your
neighbour
is
good
for
nothing
than
to
enter
into
all
the
circumstances
that
would
oblige
you
to
modify
that
opinion
besides
think
of
all
the
virtuous
declamation
all
the
penetrating
observation
which
had
been
built
up
entirely
on
the
fundamental
position
that
the
countess
was
a
very
objectionable
person
indeed
and
which
would
be
utterly
overturned
and
nullified
by
the
destruction
of
that
premiss
phipps
the
banker
wife
and
landor
the
attorney
wife
had
invested
part
of
their
reputation
for
acuteness
in
the
supposition
that
bridmain
was
not
the
countess
brother
moreover
miss
phipps
was
conscious
that
if
the
countess
was
not
a
disreputable
person
she
miss
phipps
had
no
compensating
superiority
in
virtue
to
set
against
the
other
lady
manifest
superiority
in
personal
charms
miss
stumpy
figure
and
unsuccessful
attire
instead
of
looking
down
from
a
mount
of
virtue
with
an
aureole
round
its
head
would
then
be
seen
on
the
same
level
and
in
the
same
light
as
the
countess
czerlaski
form
and
drapery
miss
phipps
for
her
part
did
like
dressing
for
effect
she
had
always
avoided
that
style
of
appearance
which
was
calculated
to
create
a
sensation
then
what
amusing
innuendoes
of
the
milby
gentlemen
over
their
wine
would
have
been
entirely
frustrated
and
reduced
to
nought
if
you
had
told
them
that
the
countess
had
really
been
guilty
of
no
misdemeanours
which
demanded
her
exclusion
from
strictly
respectable
society
that
her
husband
had
been
the
veritable
count
czerlaski
who
had
had
wonderful
escapes
as
she
said
and
who
as
she
did
say
but
as
was
said
in
certain
circulars
once
folded
by
her
fair
hands
had
subsequently
given
dancing
lessons
in
the
metropolis
that
bridmain
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
her
who
by
unimpeached
integrity
and
industry
had
won
a
partnership
in
a
and
thereby
a
moderate
fortune
that
enabled
him
to
retire
as
you
see
to
study
politics
the
weather
and
the
art
of
conversation
at
his
leisure
bridmain
in
fact
quadragenarian
bachelor
as
he
was
felt
extremely
well
pleased
to
receive
his
sister
in
her
widowhood
and
to
shine
in
the
reflected
light
of
her
beauty
and
title
every
man
who
is
not
a
monster
a
mathematician
or
a
mad
philosopher
is
the
slave
of
some
woman
or
other
bridmain
had
put
his
neck
under
the
yoke
of
his
handsome
sister
and
though
his
soul
was
a
very
little
one
of
the
smallest
description
indeed
he
would
not
have
ventured
to
call
it
his
own
he
might
be
slightly
recalcitrant
now
and
then
as
is
the
habit
of
pachyderms
under
the
thong
of
the
fair
countess
tongue
but
there
seemed
little
probability
that
he
would
ever
get
his
neck
loose
still
a
bachelor
heart
is
an
outlying
fortress
that
some
fair
enemy
may
any
day
take
either
by
storm
or
stratagem
and
there
was
always
the
possibility
that
first
nuptials
might
occur
before
the
countess
was
quite
sure
of
her
second
as
it
was
however
he
submitted
to
all
his
sister
caprices
never
grumbled
because
her
dress
and
her
maid
formed
a
considerable
item
beyond
her
own
little
income
of
sixty
pounds
per
annum
and
consented
to
lead
with
her
a
migratory
life
as
personages
on
the
debatable
ground
between
aristocracy
and
commonalty
instead
of
settling
in
some
spot
where
his
five
hundred
might
have
won
him
the
definite
dignity
of
a
parochial
magnate
the
countess
had
her
views
in
choosing
a
quiet
provincial
place
like
milby
after
three
years
of
widowhood
she
had
brought
her
feelings
to
contemplate
giving
a
successor
to
her
lamented
czerlaski
whose
fine
whiskers
fine
air
and
romantic
fortunes
had
won
her
heart
ten
years
ago
when
as
pretty
caroline
bridmain
in
the
full
bloom
of
she
was
governess
to
lady
porter
daughters
whom
he
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
the
de
and
the
quadrilles
she
had
had
seven
years
of
sufficiently
happy
matrimony
with
czerlaski
who
had
taken
her
to
paris
and
germany
and
introduced
her
there
to
many
of
his
old
friends
with
large
titles
and
small
fortunes
so
that
the
fair
caroline
had
had
considerable
experience
of
life
and
had
gathered
therefrom
not
indeed
any
very
ripe
and
comprehensive
wisdom
but
much
external
polish
and
certain
practical
conclusions
of
a
very
decided
kind
one
of
these
conclusions
was
that
there
were
things
more
solid
in
life
than
fine
whiskers
and
a
title
and
that
in
accepting
a
second
husband
she
would
regard
these
items
as
quite
subordinate
to
a
carriage
and
a
settlement
now
she
had
ascertained
by
tentative
residences
that
the
kind
of
bite
she
was
angling
for
was
difficult
to
be
met
with
at
which
were
already
preoccupied
with
abundance
of
angling
beauties
and
were
chiefly
stocked
with
men
whose
whiskers
might
be
dyed
and
whose
incomes
were
still
more
problematic
so
she
had
determined
on
trying
a
neighbourhood
where
people
were
extremely
well
acquainted
with
each
other
affairs
and
where
the
women
were
mostly
and
ugly
bridmain
slow
brain
had
adopted
his
sister
views
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
woman
so
handsome
and
distinguished
as
the
countess
must
certainly
make
a
match
that
might
lift
himself
into
the
region
of
county
celebrities
and
give
him
at
least
a
sort
of
cousinship
to
the
all
this
which
was
the
simple
truth
would
have
seemed
extremely
flat
to
the
gossips
of
milby
who
had
made
up
their
minds
to
something
much
more
exciting
there
was
nothing
here
so
very
detestable
it
is
true
the
countess
was
a
little
vain
a
little
ambitious
a
little
selfish
a
little
shallow
and
frivolous
a
little
given
to
white
but
who
considers
such
slight
blemishes
such
moral
pimples
as
these
disqualifications
for
entering
into
the
most
respectable
society
indeed
the
severest
ladies
in
milby
would
have
been
perfectly
aware
that
these
characteristics
would
have
created
no
wide
distinction
between
the
countess
czerlaski
and
themselves
and
since
it
was
clear
there
a
wide
distinction
why
it
must
lie
in
the
possession
of
some
vices
from
which
they
were
undeniably
free
hence
it
came
to
pass
that
milby
respectability
refused
to
recognize
the
countess
czerlaski
in
spite
of
her
assiduous
and
the
deep
disgust
she
was
known
to
have
expressed
at
the
extreme
paucity
of
the
congregations
on
so
she
began
to
feel
that
she
had
miscalculated
the
advantages
of
a
neighbourhood
where
people
are
well
acquainted
with
each
other
private
affairs
under
these
circumstances
you
will
imagine
how
welcome
was
the
perfect
credence
and
admiration
she
met
with
from
and
barton
she
had
been
especially
irritated
by
ely
behaviour
to
her
she
felt
sure
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
struck
with
her
beauty
that
he
quizzed
her
conversation
and
that
he
spoke
of
her
with
a
sneer
a
woman
always
knows
where
she
is
utterly
powerless
and
shuns
a
coldly
satirical
eye
as
she
would
shun
a
gorgon
and
she
was
especially
eager
for
clerical
notice
and
friendship
not
merely
because
that
is
quite
the
most
respectable
countenance
to
be
obtained
in
society
but
because
she
really
cared
about
religious
matters
and
had
an
uneasy
sense
that
she
was
not
altogether
safe
in
that
quarter
she
had
serious
intentions
of
becoming
pious
without
any
reserves
when
she
had
once
got
her
carriage
and
settlement
let
us
do
this
one
sly
trick
says
ulysses
to
neoptolemus
and
we
will
be
perfectly
honest
ever
after
greek
all
edu
gar
toi

tes
uikes
labien
tolma

d

the
countess
did
not
quote
sophocles
but
she
said
to
herself
this
little
bit
of
pretence
and
vanity
and
then
i
will
be
good
and
make
myself
quite
safe
for
another
world
and
as
she
had
by
no
means
such
fine
taste
and
insight
in
theological
teaching
as
in
costume
the
rev
amos
barton
seemed
to
her
a
man
not
only
of
learning
is
always
understood
with
a
clergyman
but
of
much
power
as
a
spiritual
director
as
for
milly
the
countess
really
loved
her
as
well
as
the
preoccupied
state
of
her
affections
would
allow
for
you
have
already
perceived
that
there
was
one
being
to
whom
the
countess
was
absorbingly
devoted
and
to
whose
desires
she
made
everything
else
subservient
namely
caroline
czerlaski
bridmain
thus
there
was
really
not
much
affectation
in
her
sweet
speeches
and
attentions
to
and
barton
still
their
friendship
by
no
means
adequately
represented
the
object
she
had
in
view
when
she
came
to
milby
and
it
had
been
for
some
time
clear
to
her
that
she
must
suggest
a
new
change
of
residence
to
her
brother
the
thing
we
look
forward
to
often
comes
to
pass
but
never
precisely
in
the
way
we
have
imagined
to
ourselves
the
countess
did
actually
leave
camp
villa
before
many
months
were
past
but
under
circumstances
which
had
not
at
all
entered
into
her
contemplation
chapter
the
rev
amos
barton
whose
sad
fortunes
i
have
undertaken
to
relate
was
you
perceive
in
no
respect
an
ideal
or
exceptional
character
and
perhaps
i
am
doing
a
bold
thing
to
bespeak
your
sympathy
on
behalf
of
a
man
who
was
so
very
far
from
remarkable
a
man
whose
virtues
were
not
heroic
and
who
had
no
undetected
crime
within
his
breast
who
had
not
the
slightest
mystery
hanging
about
him
but
was
palpably
and
unmistakably
commonplace
who
was
not
even
in
love
but
had
had
that
complaint
favourably
many
years
ago
utterly
uninteresting
character
i
think
i
hear
a
lady
reader
exclaim
farthingale
for
example
who
prefers
the
ideal
in
fiction
to
whom
tragedy
means

murder

wise
their
eyes
are
neither
deep
and
liquid
with
sentiment
nor
sparkling
with
suppressed
witticisms
they
have
probably
had
no
hairbreadth
escapes
or
thrilling
adventures
their
brains
are
certainly
not
pregnant
with
genius
and
their
passions
have
not
manifested
themselves
at
all
after
the
fashion
of
a
volcano
they
are
simply
men
of
complexions
more
or
less
muddy
whose
conversation
is
more
or
less
bald
and
disjointed
yet
these
commonplace
people
many
of
them
bear
a
conscience
and
have
felt
the
sublime
prompting
to
do
the
painful
right
they
have
their
unspoken
sorrows
and
their
sacred
joys
their
hearts
have
perhaps
gone
out
towards
their
and
they
have
mourned
over
the
irreclaimable
dead
nay
is
there
not
a
pathos
in
their
very
insignificance
in
our
comparison
of
their
dim
and
narrow
existence
with
the
glorious
possibilities
of
that
human
nature
which
they
share
depend
upon
it
you
would
gain
unspeakably
if
you
would
learn
with
me
to
see
some
of
the
poetry
and
the
pathos
the
tragedy
and
the
comedy
lying
in
the
experience
of
a
human
soul
that
looks
out
through
dull
grey
eyes
and
that
speaks
in
a
voice
of
quite
ordinary
tones
in
that
case
i
should
have
no
fear
of
your
not
caring
to
know
what
farther
befell
the
rev
amos
barton
or
of
your
thinking
the
homely
details
i
have
to
tell
at
all
beneath
your
attention
as
it
is
you
can
if
you
please
decline
to
pursue
my
story
farther
and
you
will
easily
find
reading
more
to
your
taste
since
i
learn
from
the
newspapers
that
many
remarkable
novels
full
of
striking
situations
thrilling
incidents
and
eloquent
writing
have
appeared
only
within
the
last
season
meanwhile
readers
who
have
begun
to
feel
an
interest
in
the
rev
amos
barton
and
his
wife
will
be
glad
to
learn
that
oldinport
lent
the
twenty
pounds
but
twenty
pounds
are
soon
exhausted
when
twelve
are
due
as
back
payment
to
the
butcher
and
when
the
possession
of
eight
extra
sovereigns
in
february
weather
is
an
irresistible
temptation
to
order
a
new
greatcoat
and
though
bridmain
so
far
departed
from
the
necessary
economy
entailed
on
him
by
the
countess
elegant
toilette
and
expensive
maid
as
to
choose
a
handsome
black
silk
stiff
as
his
experienced
eye
discerned
with
the
genuine
strength
of
its
own
texture
and
not
with
the
factitious
strength
of
gum
and
present
it
to
barton
in
retrieval
of
the
accident
that
had
occurred
at
his
table
yet
dear
me
as
every
husband
has
heard
what
is
the
present
of
a
gown
when
you
are
deficiently
furnished
with
the
of
apparel
and
when
moreover
there
are
six
children
whose
wear
and
tear
of
clothes
is
something
incredible
to
the
mind
indeed
the
equation
of
income
and
expenditure
was
offering
new
and
constantly
accumulating
difficulties
to
and
barton
for
shortly
after
the
birth
of
little
walter
milly
aunt
who
had
lived
with
her
ever
since
her
marriage
had
withdrawn
herself
her
furniture
and
her
yearly
income
to
the
household
of
another
niece
prompted
to
that
step
very
probably
by
a
slight
with
the
rev
amos
which
occurred
while
milly
was
upstairs
and
proved
one
too
many
for
the
elderly
patience
and
magnanimity
barton
temper
was
a
little
warm
but
on
the
other
hand
elderly
maiden
ladies
are
known
to
be
susceptible
so
we
will
not
suppose
that
all
the
blame
lay
on
his
side
the
less
so
as
he
had
every
motive
for
humouring
an
inmate
whose
presence
kept
the
wolf
from
the
door
it
was
now
nearly
a
year
since
miss
jackson
departure
and
to
a
fine
ear
the
howl
of
the
wolf
was
audibly
approaching
it
was
a
sad
thing
too
that
when
the
last
snow
had
melted
when
the
purple
and
yellow
crocuses
were
coming
up
in
the
garden
and
the
old
church
was
already
half
pulled
down
milly
had
an
illness
which
made
her
lips
look
pale
and
rendered
it
absolutely
necessary
that
she
should
not
exert
herself
for
some
time
mr
brand
the
shepperton
doctor
so
obnoxious
to
pilgrim
ordered
her
to
drink
and
it
was
quite
necessary
to
have
a
charwoman
very
often
to
assist
nanny
in
all
the
extra
work
that
fell
upon
her
hackit
who
hardly
ever
paid
a
visit
to
any
one
but
her
oldest
and
nearest
neighbour
patten
now
took
the
unusual
step
of
calling
at
the
vicarage
one
morning
and
the
tears
came
into
her
unsentimental
eyes
as
she
saw
milly
seated
pale
and
feeble
in
the
parlour
unable
to
persevere
in
sewing
the
pinafore
that
lay
on
the
table
beside
her
little
dickey
a
boisterous
boy
of
five
with
large
pink
cheeks
and
sturdy
legs
was
having
his
turn
to
sit
with
mamma
and
was
squatting
quiet
as
a
mouse
at
her
knee
holding
her
soft
white
hand
between
his
little
red
fists
he
was
a
boy
whom
hackit
in
a
severe
mood
had
pronounced
a
word
that
etymologically
in
all
probability
conveys
some
allusion
to
an
instrument
of
punishment
for
the
refractory
but
seeing
him
thus
subdued
into
goodness
she
smiled
at
him
with
her
kindest
smile
and
stooping
down
suggested
a
kiss
a
favour
which
dicky
resolutely
declined
you
take
nourishing
things
enough
was
one
of
first
questions
and
milly
endeavoured
to
make
it
appear
that
no
woman
was
ever
so
much
in
danger
of
being
and
led
into
habits
as
herself
but
hackit
gathered
one
fact
from
her
replies
namely
that
mr
brand
had
ordered
while
this
conversation
was
going
forward
dickey
had
been
furtively
stroking
and
kissing
the
soft
white
hand
so
that
at
last
when
a
pause
came
his
mother
said
smilingly
are
you
kissing
my
hand
dickey
id
to
yovely
answered
dickey
who
you
observe
was
decidedly
backward
in
his
pronunciation
hackit
remembered
this
little
scene
in
after
days
and
thought
with
peculiar
tenderness
and
pity
of
the
boy
the
next
day
there
came
a
hamper
with
hackit
respects
and
on
being
opened
it
was
found
to
contain
of
and
two
couples
of
fowls
farquhar
too
was
very
kind
insisted
on
barton
rejecting
all
arrowroot
but
hers
which
was
genuine
indian
and
carried
away
sophy
and
fred
to
stay
with
her
a
fortnight
these
and
other
attentions
made
the
trouble
of
milly
illness
more
bearable
but
they
could
not
prevent
it
from
swelling
expenses
and
barton
began
to
have
serious
thoughts
of
representing
his
case
to
a
certain
charity
for
the
relief
of
needy
curates
altogether
as
matters
stood
in
shepperton
the
parishioners
were
more
likely
to
have
a
strong
sense
that
the
clergyman
needed
their
material
aid
than
that
they
needed
his
spiritual
aid
not
the
best
state
of
things
in
this
age
and
country
where
faith
in
men
solely
on
the
ground
of
their
spiritual
gifts
has
considerably
diminished
and
especially
unfavourable
to
the
influence
of
the
rev
amos
whose
spiritual
gifts
would
not
have
had
a
very
commanding
power
even
in
an
age
of
faith
but
you
ask
did
not
the
countess
czerlaski
pay
any
attention
to
her
friends
all
this
time
to
be
sure
she
did
she
was
indefatigable
in
visiting
her
milly
and
sitting
with
her
for
hours
together
it
may
seem
remarkable
to
you
that
she
neither
thought
of
taking
away
any
of
the
children
nor
of
providing
for
any
of
milly
probable
wants
but
ladies
of
rank
and
of
luxurious
habits
you
know
can
not
be
expected
to
surmise
the
details
of
poverty
she
put
a
great
deal
of
on
barton
rearranged
her
pillow
and
footstool
kissed
her
cheeks
wrapped
her
in
a
soft
warm
shawl
from
her
own
shoulders
and
amused
her
with
stories
of
the
life
she
had
seen
abroad
when
barton
joined
them
she
talked
of
tractarianism
of
her
determination
not
to
the
vortex
of
fashionable
life
and
of
her
anxiety
to
see
him
in
a
sphere
large
enough
for
his
talents
milly
thought
her
sprightliness
and
affectionate
warmth
quite
charming
and
was
very
fond
of
her
while
the
rev
amos
had
a
vague
consciousness
that
he
had
risen
into
aristocratic
life
and
only
associated
with
his
parishioners
in
a
pastoral
and
parenthetic
manner
however
as
the
days
brightened
milly
cheeks
and
lips
brightened
too
and
in
a
few
weeks
she
was
almost
as
active
as
ever
though
watchful
eyes
might
have
seen
that
activity
was
not
easy
to
her
hackit
eyes
were
of
that
kind
and
one
day
when
and
barton
had
been
dining
with
her
for
the
first
time
since
milly
illness
she
observed
to
her
husband
poor
thing
dreadful
weak
an
delicate
she
wo
havin
many
more
children
barton
meanwhile
had
been
indefatigable
in
his
vocation
he
had
preached
two
extemporary
sermons
every
sunday
at
the
workhouse
where
a
room
had
been
fitted
up
for
divine
service
pending
the
alterations
in
the
church
and
had
walked
the
same
evening
to
a
cottage
at
one
or
other
extremity
of
his
parish
to
deliver
another
sermon
still
more
extemporary
in
an
atmosphere
impregnated
with
and
perspiration
after
all
these
labours
you
will
easily
conceive
that
he
was
considerably
exhausted
by
nine
in
the
evening
and
that
a
supper
at
a
friendly
parishioner
with
a
glass
or
even
two
glasses
of
after
it
was
a
welcome
reinforcement
barton
was
not
at
all
an
ascetic
he
thought
the
benefits
of
fasting
were
entirely
confined
to
the
old
testament
dispensation
he
was
fond
of
relaxing
himself
with
a
little
gossip
indeed
miss
bond
and
other
ladies
of
enthusiastic
views
sometimes
regretted
that
barton
did
not
more
uninterruptedly
exhibit
a
superiority
to
the
things
of
the
flesh
thin
ladies
who
take
little
exercise
and
whose
livers
are
not
strong
enough
to
bear
stimulants
are
so
extremely
critical
about
one
personal
habits
and
after
all
the
rev
amos
never
came
near
the
borders
of
a
vice
his
very
faults
were
middling
he
was
not
ungrammatical
it
was
not
in
his
nature
to
be
superlative
in
anything
unless
indeed
he
was
superlatively
middling
the
quintessential
extract
of
mediocrity
if
there
was
any
one
point
on
which
he
showed
an
inclination
to
be
excessive
it
was
confidence
in
his
own
shrewdness
and
ability
in
practical
matters
so
that
he
was
very
full
of
plans
which
were
something
like
his
moves
in
chess
admirably
well
calculated
supposing
the
state
of
the
case
were
otherwise
for
example
that
notable
plan
of
introducing
books
into
his
lending
library
did
not
in
the
least
appear
to
have
bruised
the
head
of
dissent
though
it
had
certainly
made
dissent
strongly
inclined
to
bite
the
rev
amos
heel
again
he
vexed
the
souls
of
his
churchwardens
and
influential
parishioners
by
his
fertile
suggestiveness
as
to
what
it
would
be
well
for
them
to
do
in
the
matter
of
the
church
repairs
and
other
ecclesiastical
secularities
never
saw
the
like
to
parsons
hackit
said
one
day
in
conversation
with
his
brother
churchwarden
mr
bond
for
meddling
with
business
an
they
know
no
more
about
it
than
my
black
filly
said
mr
bond
too
high
learnt
to
have
much
remarked
hackit
in
a
modest
and
dubious
tone
as
if
throwing
out
a
hypothesis
which
might
be
considered
bold
should
say
that
a
bad
sort
of
eddication
as
makes
folks
onreasonable
so
that
you
perceive
barton
popularity
was
in
that
precarious
condition
in
that
toppling
and
contingent
state
in
which
a
very
slight
push
from
a
malignant
destiny
would
utterly
upset
it
that
push
was
not
long
in
being
given
as
you
shall
hear
one
fine
may
morning
when
amos
was
out
on
his
parochial
visits
and
the
sunlight
was
streaming
through
the
of
the
where
milly
was
seated
at
her
sewing
occasionally
looking
up
to
glance
at
the
children
playing
in
the
garden
there
came
a
loud
rap
at
the
door
which
she
at
once
recognized
as
the
countess
and
that
lady
presently
entered
the
with
her
veil
drawn
over
her
face
milly
was
not
at
all
surprised
or
sorry
to
see
her
but
when
the
countess
threw
up
her
veil
and
showed
that
her
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
she
was
both
surprised
and
sorry
can
be
the
matter
dear
caroline
caroline
threw
down
jet
who
gave
a
little
yelp
then
she
threw
her
arms
round
milly
neck
and
began
to
sob
then
she
threw
herself
on
the
sofa
and
begged
for
a
glass
of
water
then
she
threw
off
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
by
the
time
milly
imagination
had
exhausted
itself
in
conjuring
up
calamities
she
said
how
shall
i
tell
you
i
am
the
most
wretched
woman
to
be
deceived
by
a
brother
to
whom
i
have
been
so
devoted
to
see
him
degrading
himself
giving
himself
utterly
to
the
dogs
can
it
be
said
milly
who
began
to
picture
to
herself
the
sober
bridmain
taking
to
brandy
and
betting
is
going
to
be
married
to
marry
my
own
maid
that
deceitful
alice
to
whom
i
have
been
the
most
indulgent
mistress
did
you
ever
hear
of
anything
so
disgraceful
so
mortifying
so
disreputable
has
he
only
just
told
you
of
it
said
milly
who
having
really
heard
of
worse
conduct
even
in
her
innocent
life
avoided
a
direct
answer
me
of
it
he
had
not
even
the
grace
to
do
that
i
went
into
the
suddenly
and
found
him
kissing
her
disgusting
at
his
time
of
life
is
it
not
and
when
i
reproved
her
for
allowing
such
liberties
she
turned
round
saucily
and
said
she
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
my
brother
and
she
saw
no
shame
in
allowing
him
to
kiss
her
edmund
is
a
miserable
coward
you
know
and
looked
frightened
but
when
she
asked
him
to
say
whether
it
was
not
so
he
tried
to
summon
up
courage
and
say
yes
i
left
the
room
in
disgust
and
this
morning
i
have
been
questioning
edmund
and
find
that
he
is
bent
on
marrying
this
woman
and
that
he
has
been
putting
off
telling
me
because
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
i
suppose
i
could
possibly
stay
in
the
house
after
this
with
my
own
maid
turned
mistress
and
now
milly
i
am
come
to
throw
myself
on
your
charity
for
a
week
or
two
you
take
me
in
we
will
said
milly
you
will
only
put
up
with
our
poor
rooms
and
way
of
living
it
will
be
delightful
to
have
you
will
soothe
me
to
be
with
you
and
barton
a
little
while
i
feel
quite
unable
to
go
among
my
other
friends
just
at
present
what
those
two
wretched
people
will
do
i
do
know
leave
the
neighbourhood
at
once
i
hope
i
entreated
my
brother
to
do
so
before
he
disgraced
himself
when
amos
came
home
he
joined
his
cordial
welcome
and
sympathy
to
milly
the
countess
formidable
boxes
which
she
had
carefully
packed
before
her
indignation
drove
her
away
from
camp
villa
arrived
at
the
vicarage
and
were
deposited
in
the
spare
bedroom
and
in
two
closets
not
spare
which
milly
emptied
for
their
reception
a
week
afterwards
the
excellent
apartments
at
camp
villa
comprising
dining
and
drawing
rooms
three
bedrooms
and
a
were
again
to
let
and
bridmain
sudden
departure
together
with
the
countess
installation
as
a
visitor
at
shepperton
vicarage
became
a
topic
of
general
conversation
in
the
neighbourhood
the
virtue
of
milby
and
shepperton
saw
in
all
this
a
confirmation
of
its
worst
suspicions
and
pitied
the
rev
amos
barton
gullibility
but
when
week
after
week
and
month
after
month
slipped
by
without
witnessing
the
countess
departure
when
summer
and
harvest
had
fled
and
still
left
her
behind
them
occupying
the
spare
bedroom
and
the
closets
and
also
a
large
proportion
of
barton
time
and
attention
new
surmises
of
a
very
evil
kind
were
added
to
the
old
rumours
and
began
to
take
the
form
of
settled
convictions
in
the
minds
even
of
most
friendly
parishioners
and
now
here
is
an
opportunity
for
an
accomplished
writer
to
apostrophize
calumny
to
quote
virgil
and
to
show
that
he
is
acquainted
with
the
most
ingenious
things
which
have
been
said
on
that
subject
in
polite
literature
but
what
is
opportunity
to
the
man
who
ca
use
it
an
undefecundated
egg
which
the
waves
of
time
wash
away
into
nonentity
so
as
my
memory
is
and
my
notebook
still
worse
i
am
unable
to
show
myself
either
erudite
or
eloquent
apropos
of
the
calumny
whereof
the
rev
amos
barton
was
the
victim
i
can
only
ask
my
reader
did
you
ever
upset
your
and
watch
in
helpless
agony
the
rapid
spread
of
stygian
blackness
over
your
fair
manuscript
or
fairer
with
a
like
inky
swiftness
did
gossip
now
blacken
the
reputation
of
the
rev
amos
barton
causing
the
unfriendly
to
scorn
and
even
the
friendly
to
stand
aloof
at
a
time
when
difficulties
of
another
kind
were
fast
thickening
around
him
chapter
one
november
morning
at
least
six
months
after
the
countess
czerlaski
had
taken
up
her
residence
at
the
vicarage
hackit
heard
that
her
neighbour
patten
had
an
attack
of
her
old
complaint
vaguely
called
spasms
accordingly
about
eleven
she
put
on
her
velvet
bonnet
and
cloth
cloak
with
a
long
boa
and
muff
large
enough
to
stow
a
prize
baby
in
for
hackit
regulated
her
costume
by
the
calendar
and
brought
out
her
furs
on
the
first
of
november
whatever
might
be
the
temperature
she
was
not
a
woman
weakly
to
accommodate
herself
to
proceedings
if
the
season
did
know
what
it
ought
to
do
hackit
did
in
her
best
days
it
was
always
sharp
weather
at
plot
and
she
did
like
new
fashions
and
this
morning
the
weather
was
very
rationally
in
accordance
with
her
costume
for
as
she
made
her
way
through
the
fields
to
cross
farm
the
yellow
leaves
on
the
elms
which
showed
bright
and
golden
against
the
purple
clouds
were
being
scattered
across
the
grassy
path
by
the
coldest
of
november
winds
hackit
thought
to
herself
daresay
we
shall
have
a
sharp
pinch
this
winter
and
if
we
do
i
should
wonder
if
it
takes
the
old
lady
off
they
say
a
green
yule
makes
a
fat
churchyard
but
so
does
a
white
yule
too
for
that
matter
when
the
stool
rotten
enough
no
matter
who
sits
on
it
however
on
her
arrival
at
cross
farm
the
prospect
of
decease
was
again
thrown
into
the
dim
distance
in
her
imagination
for
miss
janet
gibbs
met
her
with
the
news
that
patten
was
much
better
and
led
her
without
any
preliminary
announcement
to
the
old
bedroom
janet
had
scarcely
reached
the
end
of
her
circumstantial
narrative
how
the
attack
came
on
and
what
were
her
aunt
sensations
a
narrative
to
which
patten
in
her
nightcap
seemed
to
listen
with
a
contemptuous
resignation
to
her
niece
historical
inaccuracy
contenting
herself
with
occasionally
confounding
janet
by
a
shake
of
the
head
when
the
clatter
of
a
horse
hoofs
on
the
yard
pavement
announced
the
arrival
of
pilgrim
whose
large
person
presently
made
its
appearance
upstairs
he
found
patten
going
on
so
well
that
there
was
no
need
to
look
solemn
he
might
glide
from
condolence
into
gossip
without
offence
and
the
temptation
of
having
hackit
ear
was
irresistible
a
disgraceful
business
this
is
turning
out
of
your
parson
was
the
remark
with
which
he
made
this
agreeable
transition
throwing
himself
back
in
the
chair
from
which
he
had
been
leaning
towards
the
patient
dear
me
said
hackit
enough
i
stuck
to
barton
as
long
as
i
could
for
his
wife
sake
but
i
ca
countenance
such
it
hateful
to
see
that
woman
coming
with
to
service
of
a
sunday
and
if
hackit
was
churchwarden
and
i
did
think
it
wrong
to
forsake
one
own
parish
i
should
go
to
knebley
church
a
many
as
do
used
to
think
barton
was
only
a
fool
observed
pilgrim
in
a
tone
which
implied
that
he
was
conscious
of
having
been
weakly
charitable
thought
he
was
imposed
upon
and
led
away
by
those
people
when
they
first
came
but
that
impossible
now
it
as
plain
as
the
nose
in
your
face
said
hackit
unreflectingly
not
perceiving
the
equivoque
in
her
comparison
to
milby
like
a
sparrow
perchin
on
a
bough
as
i
may
say
with
her
brother
as
she
called
him
and
then
all
on
a
sudden
the
brother
goes
off
with
himself
and
she
throws
herself
on
the
bartons
though
what
could
make
her
take
up
with
a
poor
notomise
of
a
parson
as
has
got
enough
to
keep
wife
and
children
there
one
above
knows
do
barton
may
have
attractions
we
do
know
of
said
pilgrim
who
piqued
himself
on
a
talent
for
sarcasm
countess
has
no
maid
now
and
they
say
barton
is
handy
in
assisting
at
her
toilette
laces
her
boots
and
so
forth
be
fiddled
said
hackit
with
indignant
boldness
of
metaphor
there
that
poor
thing
her
fingers
to
the
bone
for
them
children
an
another
comin
on
what
she
must
have
to
go
through
it
goes
to
my
heart
to
turn
my
back
on
her
but
she
i
the
wrong
to
let
herself
be
put
upon
i
that
manner
i
was
talking
to
farquhar
about
that
the
other
day
she
said
i
think
barton
a
pilgrim
gave
this
quotation
with
slow
emphasis
as
if
he
thought
farquhar
had
uttered
a
remarkable
sentiment
find
it
impossible
to
invite
her
to
their
house
while
she
has
that
equivocal
person
staying
with
her
remarked
miss
gibbs
i
was
a
wife
nothing
should
induce
me
to
bear
what
barton
does
it
fine
talking
said
patten
from
her
pillow
husbands
are
if
you
was
a
wife
you
be
as
foolish
as
your
betters
belike
my
wonder
is
observed
hackit
the
bartons
make
both
ends
meet
you
may
depend
on
it
got
nothing
to
give
for
i
understand
as
he
been
having
money
from
some
clergy
charity
they
said
at
fust
as
she
stuffed
barton
wi
notions
about
her
writing
to
the
chancellor
an
her
fine
friends
to
give
him
a
living
howiver
i
know
what
true
an
what
false
barton
keeps
away
from
our
house
now
for
i
gave
him
a
bit
o
my
mind
one
day
maybe
he
ashamed
of
himself
he
seems
to
me
to
look
dreadful
thin
an
harassed
of
a
sunday
he
must
be
aware
he
getting
into
bad
odour
everywhere
the
clergy
are
quite
disgusted
with
his
folly
they
say
carpe
would
be
glad
to
get
barton
out
of
the
curacy
if
he
could
but
he
ca
do
that
without
coming
to
shepperton
himself
as
barton
a
licensed
curate
and
he
like
that
i
suppose
at
this
moment
patten
showed
signs
of
uneasiness
which
recalled
pilgrim
to
professional
attentions
and
hackit
observing
that
it
was
thursday
and
she
must
see
after
the
butter
said
promising
to
look
in
again
soon
and
bring
her
knitting
this
thursday
by
the
by
is
the
first
in
the
month
the
day
on
which
the
clerical
meeting
is
held
at
milby
vicarage
and
as
the
rev
amos
barton
has
reasons
for
not
attending
he
will
very
likely
be
a
subject
of
conversation
amongst
his
clerical
brethren
suppose
we
go
there
and
hear
whether
pilgrim
has
reported
their
opinion
correctly
there
is
not
a
numerous
party
today
for
it
is
a
season
of
sore
throats
and
catarrhs
so
that
the
exegetical
and
theological
discussions
which
are
the
preliminary
of
dining
have
not
been
quite
so
spirited
as
usual
and
although
a
question
relative
to
the
epistle
of
jude
has
not
been
quite
cleared
up
the
striking
of
six
by
the
church
clock
and
the
simultaneous
announcement
of
dinner
are
sounds
that
no
one
feels
to
be
importunate
pleasant
when
one
is
not
in
the
least
bilious
to
enter
a
comfortable
where
the
red
curtains
glow
with
the
double
light
of
fire
and
candle
where
glass
and
silver
are
glittering
on
the
pure
damask
and
a
gives
a
hint
of
the
fragrance
that
will
presently
rush
out
to
inundate
your
hungry
senses
and
prepare
them
by
the
delicate
visitation
of
atoms
for
the
keen
gusto
of
ampler
contact
especially
if
you
have
confidence
in
the
capacity
of
your
host
if
you
know
that
he
is
not
a
man
who
entertains
grovelling
views
of
eating
and
drinking
as
a
mere
satisfaction
of
hunger
and
thirst
and
dead
to
all
the
finer
influences
of
the
palate
expects
his
guest
to
be
brilliant
on
gravies
and
the
cheapest
marsala
ely
was
particularly
worthy
of
such
confidence
and
his
virtues
as
an
amphitryon
had
probably
contributed
quite
as
much
as
the
central
situation
of
milby
to
the
selection
of
his
house
as
a
clerical
rendezvous
he
looks
particularly
graceful
at
the
head
of
his
table
and
indeed
on
all
occasions
where
he
acts
as
president
or
moderator
he
is
a
man
who
seems
to
listen
well
and
is
an
excellent
amalgam
of
dissimilar
ingredients
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
as
sits
fellowes
rector
and
magistrate
a
man
of
imposing
appearance
with
a
mellifluous
voice
and
the
readiest
of
tongues
fellowes
once
obtained
a
living
by
the
persuasive
charms
of
his
conversation
and
the
fluency
with
which
he
interpreted
the
opinions
of
an
obese
and
stammering
baronet
so
as
to
give
that
elderly
gentleman
a
very
pleasing
perception
of
his
own
wisdom
fellowes
is
a
very
successful
man
and
has
the
highest
character
everywhere
except
in
his
own
parish
where
doubtless
because
his
parishioners
happen
to
be
quarrelsome
people
he
is
always
at
fierce
feud
with
a
farmer
or
two
a
colliery
proprietor
a
grocer
who
was
once
churchwarden
and
a
tailor
who
formerly
officiated
as
clerk
at
ely
right
hand
you
see
a
very
small
man
with
a
sallow
and
somewhat
puffy
face
whose
hair
is
brushed
straight
up
evidently
with
the
intention
of
giving
him
a
height
somewhat
less
disproportionate
to
his
sense
of
his
own
importance
than
the
measure
of
five
feet
three
accorded
him
by
an
oversight
of
nature
this
is
rev
archibald
duke
a
very
dyspeptic
and
evangelical
man
who
takes
the
gloomiest
view
of
mankind
and
their
prospects
and
thinks
the
immense
sale
of
the
papers
recently
completed
one
of
the
strongest
proofs
of
original
sin
unfortunately
though
duke
was
not
burdened
with
a
family
his
yearly
expenditure
was
apt
considerably
to
exceed
his
income
and
the
unpleasant
circumstances
resulting
from
this
together
with
heavy
may
probably
have
contributed
to
his
desponding
views
of
the
world
generally
next
to
him
is
seated
furness
a
tall
young
man
with
blond
hair
and
whiskers
who
was
plucked
at
cambridge
entirely
owing
to
his
genius
at
least
i
know
that
he
soon
afterwards
published
a
volume
of
poems
which
were
considered
remarkably
beautiful
by
many
young
ladies
of
his
acquaintance
furness
preached
his
own
sermons
as
any
one
of
tolerable
critical
acumen
might
have
certified
by
comparing
them
with
his
poems
in
both
there
was
an
exuberance
of
metaphor
and
simile
entirely
original
and
not
in
the
least
borrowed
from
any
resemblance
in
the
things
compared
on
furness
left
you
see
pugh
another
young
curate
of
much
less
marked
characteristics
he
had
not
published
any
poems
he
had
not
even
been
plucked
he
had
neat
black
whiskers
and
a
pale
complexion
read
prayers
and
a
sermon
twice
every
sunday
and
might
be
seen
any
day
sallying
forth
on
his
parochial
duties
in
a
white
tie
a
hat
a
perfect
suit
of
black
and
boots
an
equipment
which
he
probably
supposed
hieroglyphically
to
represent
the
spirit
of
christianity
to
the
parishioners
of
whittlecombe
pugh
is
the
rev
martin
cleves
a
man
about
forty
with
a
cravat
large
irregular
features
and
a
large
head
thickly
covered
with
lanky
brown
hair
to
a
superficial
glance
cleves
is
the
plainest
and
least
of
the
party
yet
strange
to
say
is
the
true
parish
priest
the
pastor
beloved
consulted
relied
on
by
his
flock
a
clergyman
who
is
not
associated
with
the
undertaker
but
thought
of
as
the
surest
helper
under
a
difficulty
as
a
monitor
who
is
encouraging
rather
than
severe
cleves
has
the
wonderful
art
of
preaching
sermons
which
the
wheelwright
and
the
blacksmith
can
understand
not
because
he
talks
condescending
twaddle
but
because
he
can
call
a
spade
a
spade
and
knows
how
to
disencumber
ideas
of
their
wordy
frippery
look
at
him
more
attentively
and
you
will
see
that
his
face
is
a
very
interesting
one
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
humour
and
feeling
playing
in
his
grey
eyes
and
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
a
man
you
observe
who
has
most
likely
sprung
from
the
section
of
the
middle
class
and
has
hereditary
sympathies
with
the
checkered
life
of
the
people
he
gets
together
the
working
men
in
his
parish
on
a
monday
evening
and
gives
them
a
sort
of
conversational
lecture
on
useful
practical
matters
telling
them
stories
or
reading
some
select
passages
from
an
agreeable
book
and
commenting
on
them
and
if
you
were
to
ask
the
first
labourer
or
artisan
in
tripplegate
what
sort
of
man
the
parson
was
he
would
say
uncommon
knowin
sensable
gentleman
very
kind
an
too
yet
for
all
this
he
is
perhaps
the
best
grecian
of
the
party
if
we
except
baird
the
young
man
on
his
left
baird
has
since
gained
considerable
celebrity
as
an
original
writer
and
metropolitan
lecturer
but
at
that
time
he
used
to
preach
in
a
little
church
something
like
a
barn
to
a
congregation
consisting
of
three
rich
farmers
and
their
servants
about
fifteen
labourers
and
the
due
proportion
of
women
and
children
the
rich
farmers
understood
him
to
be
high
learnt
but
if
you
had
interrogated
them
for
a
more
precise
description
they
would
have
said
that
he
was
man
with
a
sort
o
cast
in
his
eye
like
seven
altogether
a
delightful
number
for
a
supposing
the
units
to
be
delightful
but
everything
depends
on
that
during
dinner
fellowes
took
the
lead
in
the
conversation
which
set
strongly
in
the
direction
of
and
the
rotation
of
crops
for
fellowes
and
cleves
cultivated
their
own
glebes
ely
too
had
some
agricultural
notions
and
even
the
rev
archibald
duke
was
made
alive
to
that
class
of
mundane
subjects
by
the
possession
of
some
the
two
young
curates
talked
a
little
aside
during
these
discussions
which
had
imperfect
interest
for
their
unbeneficed
minds
and
the
transcendental
and
baird
seemed
to
listen
somewhat
abstractedly
knowing
little
more
of
potatoes
and
than
that
they
were
some
form
of
the
a
hobby
farming
is
with
lord
watling
said
fellowes
when
the
cloth
was
being
drawn
went
over
his
farm
at
tetterley
with
him
last
summer
it
is
really
a
model
farm
dairy
grazing
and
wheat
land
and
such
splendid
an
expensive
hobby
though
he
sinks
a
good
deal
of
money
there
i
fancy
he
has
a
great
whim
for
black
cattle
and
he
sends
that
drunken
old
scotch
bailiff
of
his
to
scotland
every
year
with
hundreds
in
his
pocket
to
buy
these
beasts
the
by
said
ely
you
know
who
is
the
man
to
whom
lord
watling
has
given
the
bramhill
living
man
named
sargent
i
knew
him
at
oxford
his
brother
is
a
lawyer
and
was
very
useful
to
lord
watling
in
that
ugly
brounsell
affair
that
why
sargent
got
the
living
said
ely
know
him
is
he
a
showy
talkative
fellow
has
written
travels
in
mesopotamia
or
something
of
that
sort
the
man
was
at
witherington
once
as
bagshawe
curate
he
got
into
rather
bad
odour
there
through
some
scandal
about
a
flirtation
i
think
of
scandal
returned
fellowes
you
heard
the
last
story
about
barton
nisbett
was
telling
me
the
other
day
that
he
dines
alone
with
the
countess
at
six
while
barton
is
in
the
kitchen
acting
as
cook
an
apocryphal
authority
nisbett
said
ely
said
cleves
with
humour
twinkling
in
his
eyes
upon
it
that
is
a
corrupt
version
the
original
text
is
that
they
all
dined
together
six
meaning
six
children
and
that
barton
is
an
excellent
cook
wish
dining
alone
together
may
be
the
worst
of
that
sad
business
said
the
rev
archibald
duke
in
a
tone
implying
that
his
wish
was
a
strong
figure
of
speech
said
fellowes
filling
his
glass
and
looking
jocose
is
certain
either
the
greatest
gull
in
existence
or
he
has
some
cunning
secret
some
philtre
or
other
to
make
himself
charming
in
the
eyes
of
a
fair
lady
it
is
all
of
us
that
can
make
conquests
when
our
ugliness
is
past
its
bloom
lady
seemed
to
have
made
a
conquest
of
him
at
the
very
outset
said
ely
was
immensely
amused
one
night
at
granby
when
he
was
telling
us
her
story
about
her
husband
adventures
he
said
when
she
told
me
the
tale
i
felt
i
do
know
how
i
felt
it
from
the
crown
of
my
head
to
the
sole
of
my
feet
ely
gave
these
words
dramatically
imitating
the
rev
amos
fervour
and
symbolic
action
and
every
one
laughed
except
duke
whose
view
of
things
was
not
apt
to
be
jovial
he
said
think
some
of
us
ought
to
remonstrate
with
barton
on
the
scandal
he
is
causing
he
is
not
only
imperilling
his
own
soul
but
the
souls
of
his
flock
upon
it
said
cleves
is
some
simple
explanation
of
the
whole
affair
if
we
only
happened
to
know
it
barton
has
always
impressed
me
as
a
man
who
has
the
knack
of
doing
himself
injustice
by
his
manner
i
never
liked
barton
said
fellowes
not
a
gentleman
why
he
used
to
be
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
that
canting
prior
who
died
a
little
while
ago
a
fellow
who
soaked
himself
with
spirits
and
talked
of
the
gospel
through
an
inflamed
nose
countess
has
given
him
more
refined
tastes
i
daresay
said
ely
observed
cleves
poor
fellow
must
have
a
hard
pull
to
get
along
with
his
small
income
and
large
family
let
us
hope
the
countess
does
something
towards
making
the
pot
boil
she
said
duke
are
greater
signs
of
poverty
about
them
than
ever
come
returned
cleves
who
could
be
caustic
sometimes
and
who
was
not
at
all
fond
of
his
reverend
brother
duke
something
in
barton
favour
at
all
events
he
might
be
poor
showing
signs
of
poverty
duke
turned
rather
yellow
which
was
his
way
of
blushing
and
ely
came
to
his
relief
by
observing
making
a
very
good
piece
of
work
of
shepperton
church
dolby
the
architect
who
has
it
in
hand
is
a
very
clever
fellow
he
who
has
been
doing
coppleton
church
said
furness
got
it
in
excellent
order
for
the
visitation
this
mention
of
the
visitation
suggested
the
bishop
and
thus
opened
a
wide
duct
which
entirely
diverted
the
stream
of
animadversion
from
that
small
pipe
that
capillary
vessel
the
rev
amos
barton
the
talk
of
the
clergy
about
their
bishop
belongs
to
the
esoteric
part
of
their
profession
so
we
will
at
once
quit
the
at
milby
vicarage
lest
we
should
happen
to
overhear
remarks
unsuited
to
the
lay
understanding
and
perhaps
dangerous
to
our
repose
of
mind
chapter
i
dare
say
the
long
residence
of
the
countess
czerlaski
at
shepperton
vicarage
is
very
puzzling
to
you
also
dear
reader
as
well
as
to
barton
clerical
brethren
the
more
so
as
i
hope
you
are
not
in
the
least
inclined
to
put
that
very
evil
interpretation
on
it
which
evidently
found
acceptance
with
the
sallow
and
dyspeptic
duke
and
with
the
florid
and
highly
peptic
fellowes
you
have
seen
enough
i
trust
of
the
rev
amos
barton
to
be
convinced
that
he
was
more
apt
to
fall
into
a
blunder
than
into
a
sin
more
apt
to
be
deceived
than
to
incur
a
necessity
for
being
deceitful
and
if
you
have
a
keen
eye
for
physiognomy
you
will
have
detected
that
the
countess
czerlaski
loved
herself
far
too
well
to
get
entangled
in
an
unprofitable
vice
how
then
you
will
say
could
this
fine
lady
choose
to
quarter
herself
on
the
establishment
of
a
poor
curate
where
the
carpets
were
probably
falling
into
holes
where
the
attendance
was
limited
to
a
maid
of
all
work
and
where
six
children
were
running
loose
from
eight
in
the
morning
till
eight
in
the
evening
surely
you
must
be
misrepresenting
the
facts
heaven
forbid
for
not
having
a
lofty
imagination
as
you
perceive
and
being
unable
to
invent
thrilling
incidents
for
your
amusement
my
only
merit
must
lie
in
the
truth
with
which
i
represent
to
you
the
humble
experience
of
an
ordinary
i
wish
to
stir
your
sympathy
with
commonplace
troubles
to
win
your
tears
for
real
sorrow
sorrow
such
as
may
live
next
door
to
you
such
as
walks
neither
in
rags
nor
in
velvet
but
in
very
ordinary
decent
apparel
therefore
that
you
may
dismiss
your
suspicions
of
my
veracity
i
will
beg
you
to
consider
that
at
the
time
the
countess
czerlaski
left
camp
villa
in
dudgeon
she
had
only
twenty
pounds
in
her
pocket
being
about
of
the
income
she
possessed
independently
of
her
brother
you
will
then
perceive
that
she
was
in
the
extremely
inconvenient
predicament
of
having
quarrelled
not
indeed
with
her
bread
and
cheese
but
certainly
with
her
chicken
and
tart
a
predicament
all
the
more
inconvenient
to
her
because
the
habit
of
idleness
had
quite
unfitted
her
for
earning
those
necessary
superfluities
and
because
with
all
her
fascinations
she
had
not
secured
any
enthusiastic
friends
whose
houses
were
open
to
her
and
who
were
dying
to
see
her
thus
she
had
completely
checkmated
herself
unless
she
could
resolve
on
one
unpleasant
move
namely
to
humble
herself
to
her
brother
and
recognize
his
wife
this
seemed
quite
impossible
to
her
as
long
as
she
entertained
the
hope
that
he
would
make
the
first
advances
and
in
this
flattering
hope
she
remained
month
after
month
at
shepperton
vicarage
gracefully
overlooking
the
deficiencies
of
accommodation
and
feeling
that
she
was
really
behaving
charmingly
indeed
she
thought
to
herself
do
otherwise
with
a
lovely
gentle
creature
like
milly
i
shall
really
be
sorry
to
leave
the
poor
thing
so
though
she
lay
in
bed
till
ten
and
came
down
to
a
separate
breakfast
at
eleven
she
kindly
consented
to
dine
as
early
as
five
when
a
hot
joint
was
prepared
which
coldly
furnished
forth
the
children
table
the
next
day
she
considerately
prevented
milly
from
devoting
herself
too
closely
to
the
children
by
insisting
on
reading
talking
and
walking
with
her
and
she
even
began
to
embroider
a
cap
for
the
next
baby
which
must
certainly
be
a
girl
and
be
named
caroline
after
the
first
month
or
two
of
her
residence
at
the
vicarage
the
rev
amos
barton
became
aware
as
indeed
it
was
unavoidable
that
he
should
of
the
strong
disapprobation
it
drew
upon
him
and
the
change
of
feeling
towards
him
which
it
was
producing
in
his
kindest
parishioners
but
in
the
first
place
he
still
believed
in
the
countess
as
a
charming
and
influential
woman
disposed
to
befriend
him
and
in
any
case
he
could
hardly
hint
departure
to
a
lady
guest
who
had
been
kind
to
him
and
his
and
who
might
any
day
spontaneously
announce
the
termination
of
her
visit
in
the
second
place
he
was
conscious
of
his
own
innocence
and
felt
some
contemptuous
indignation
towards
people
who
were
ready
to
imagine
evil
of
him
and
lastly
he
had
as
i
have
already
intimated
a
strong
will
of
his
own
so
that
a
certain
obstinacy
and
defiance
mingled
itself
with
his
other
feelings
on
the
subject
the
one
unpleasant
consequence
which
was
not
to
be
evaded
or
counteracted
by
any
mere
mental
state
was
the
increasing
drain
on
his
slender
purse
for
household
expenses
to
meet
which
the
remittance
he
had
received
from
the
clerical
charity
threatened
to
be
quite
inadequate
slander
may
be
defeated
by
equanimity
but
courageous
thoughts
will
not
pay
your
bill
and
fortitude
is
nowhere
considered
legal
tender
for
beef
month
after
month
the
financial
aspect
of
the
rev
amos
affairs
became
more
and
more
serious
to
him
and
month
after
month
too
wore
away
more
and
more
of
that
armour
of
indignation
and
defiance
with
which
he
had
at
first
defended
himself
from
the
harsh
looks
of
faces
that
were
once
the
friendliest
but
quite
the
heaviest
pressure
of
the
trouble
fell
on
milly
on
gentle
uncomplaining
milly
whose
delicate
body
was
becoming
daily
less
fit
for
all
the
many
things
that
had
to
be
done
between
rising
up
and
lying
down
at
first
she
thought
the
countess
visit
would
not
last
long
and
she
was
quite
glad
to
incur
extra
exertion
for
the
sake
of
making
her
friend
comfortable
i
can
hardly
bear
to
think
of
all
the
rough
work
she
did
with
those
lovely
hands
all
by
the
sly
without
letting
her
husband
know
anything
about
it
and
husbands
are
not
clairvoyant
how
she
salted
bacon
ironed
shirts
and
cravats
put
patches
on
patches
and
darns
then
there
was
the
task
of
mending
and
eking
out
in
prospect
and
the
problem
perpetually
suggesting
itself
how
she
and
nanny
should
manage
when
there
was
another
baby
as
there
would
be
before
very
many
months
were
past
when
time
glided
on
and
the
countess
visit
did
not
end
milly
was
not
blind
to
any
phase
of
their
position
she
knew
of
the
slander
she
was
aware
of
the
keeping
aloof
of
old
friends
but
these
she
felt
almost
entirely
on
her
husband
account
a
loving
woman
world
lies
within
the
four
walls
of
her
own
home
and
it
is
only
through
her
husband
that
she
is
in
any
electric
communication
with
the
world
beyond
simpkins
may
have
looked
scornfully
at
her
but
baby
crows
and
holds
out
his
little
arms
none
the
less
blithely
tomkins
may
have
left
off
calling
on
her
but
her
husband
comes
home
none
the
less
to
receive
her
care
and
caresses
it
has
been
wet
and
gloomy
out
of
doors
today
but
she
has
looked
well
after
the
shirt
buttons
has
cut
out
baby
pinafores
and
half
finished
willy
blouse
so
it
was
with
milly
she
was
only
vexed
that
her
husband
should
be
vexed
only
wounded
because
he
was
misconceived
but
the
difficulty
about
ways
and
means
she
felt
in
quite
a
different
manner
her
rectitude
was
alarmed
lest
they
should
have
to
make
tradesmen
wait
for
their
money
her
motherly
love
dreaded
the
diminution
of
comforts
for
the
children
and
the
sense
of
her
own
failing
health
gave
exaggerated
force
to
these
fears
milly
could
no
longer
shut
her
eyes
to
the
fact
that
the
countess
was
inconsiderate
if
she
did
not
allow
herself
to
entertain
severer
thoughts
and
she
began
to
feel
that
it
would
soon
be
a
duty
to
tell
her
frankly
that
they
really
could
not
afford
to
have
her
visit
farther
prolonged
but
a
process
was
going
forward
in
two
other
minds
which
ultimately
saved
milly
from
having
to
perform
this
painful
task
in
the
first
place
the
countess
was
getting
weary
of
shepperton
weary
of
waiting
for
her
brother
overtures
which
never
came
so
one
fine
morning
she
reflected
that
forgiveness
was
a
christian
duty
that
a
sister
should
be
placable
that
bridmain
must
feel
the
need
of
her
advice
to
which
he
had
been
accustomed
for
three
years
and
that
very
likely
woman
did
make
the
poor
man
happy
in
this
amiable
frame
of
mind
she
wrote
a
very
affectionate
appeal
and
addressed
it
to
bridmain
through
his
banker
another
mind
that
was
being
wrought
up
to
a
climax
was
nanny
the
who
had
a
warm
heart
and
a
still
warmer
temper
nanny
adored
her
mistress
she
had
been
heard
to
say
that
she
was
to
kiss
the
ground
as
the
missis
trod
on
and
walter
she
considered
was
baby
of
whom
she
was
as
jealous
as
a
lover
but
she
had
from
the
first
very
slight
admiration
for
the
countess
czerlaski
that
lady
from
nanny
point
of
view
was
a
personage
always
out
i
fine
clothes
the
chief
result
of
whose
existence
was
to
cause
additional
carrying
of
hot
water
laying
of
and
cooking
of
dinners
it
was
a
perpetually
heightening
to
nanny
that
she
and
her
mistress
had
to
more
than
ever
because
there
was
this
fine
lady
in
the
house
she
pays
nothin
neither
observed
nanny
to
jacob
tomms
a
young
gentleman
in
the
tailoring
line
who
occasionally
simply
out
of
a
taste
for
dialogue
looked
into
the
vicarage
kitchen
of
an
evening
know
the
master
shorter
o
money
than
iver
an
it
meks
no
end
difference
i
th
housekeepin
her
bein
here
besides
bein
obliged
to
have
a
charwoman
constant
fine
stories
i
the
village
about
her
said
tomms
say
as
muster
barton
great
wi
her
or
else
she
niver
stop
here
they
say
a
passill
o
lies
an
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
go
tell
again
do
you
think
as
the
master
as
has
got
a
wife
like
the
missis
go
running
arter
a
piece
o
goods
like
that
countess
as
is
fit
to
black
the
missis
shoes
i
none
so
fond
the
master
but
i
know
better
on
him
nor
that
i
did
it
said
tomms
humbly
it
you
ha
been
a
ninny
if
yer
did
an
she
a
nasty
stingy
thing
that
countess
she
niver
giv
me
a
sixpence
nor
an
old
rag
neither
sin
here
she
been
a
bed
an
down
to
breakfast
when
other
folks
wants
their
dinner
if
such
was
the
state
of
nanny
mind
as
early
as
the
end
of
august
when
this
dialogue
with
tomms
occurred
you
may
imagine
what
it
must
have
been
by
the
beginning
of
november
and
that
at
that
time
a
very
slight
spark
might
any
day
cause
the
anger
to
flame
forth
in
open
indignation
that
spark
happened
to
fall
the
very
morning
that
hackit
paid
the
visit
to
patten
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
nanny
dislike
of
the
countess
extended
to
the
innocent
dog
jet
whom
she
to
see
made
a
fuss
wi
like
a
christian
an
the
little
ouzle
must
be
washed
too
ivery
saturday
as
if
there
was
children
enoo
to
wash
washin
dogs
now
this
particular
morning
it
happened
that
milly
was
quite
too
poorly
to
get
up
and
barton
observed
to
nanny
on
going
out
that
he
would
call
and
tell
mr
brand
to
come
these
circumstances
were
already
enough
to
make
nanny
anxious
and
susceptible
but
the
countess
comfortably
ignorant
of
them
came
down
as
usual
about
eleven
to
her
separate
breakfast
which
stood
ready
for
her
at
that
hour
in
the
parlour
the
kettle
singing
on
the
hob
that
she
might
make
her
own
tea
there
was
a
little
jug
of
cream
taken
according
to
custom
from
last
night
milk
and
specially
saved
for
the
countess
breakfast
jet
always
awaited
his
mistress
at
her
bedroom
door
and
it
was
her
habit
to
carry
him
down
stairs
my
little
jet
she
said
putting
him
down
gently
on
the
shall
have
a
nice
nice
breakfast
jet
indicated
that
he
thought
that
observation
extremely
pertinent
and
by
immediately
raising
himself
on
his
and
the
countess
emptied
the
into
the
saucer
now
there
was
usually
a
small
jug
of
milk
standing
on
the
tray
by
the
side
of
the
cream
and
destined
for
jet
breakfast
but
this
morning
nanny
being
had
forgotten
that
part
of
the
arrangements
so
that
when
the
countess
had
made
her
tea
she
perceived
there
was
no
second
jug
and
rang
the
bell
nanny
appeared
looking
very
red
and
heated
the
fact
was
she
had
been
up
the
kitchen
fire
and
that
is
a
sort
of
work
which
by
no
means
conduces
to
blandness
of
temper
you
have
forgotten
milk
will
you
bring
me
some
more
cream
please
this
was
just
a
little
too
much
for
nanny
forbearance
i
dare
say
here
am
i
wi
my
hands
full
o
the
children
an
the
dinner
and
missis
ill
and
mr
brand
and
i

to
that
nasty
little
blackamoor
barton
ill

i
should
think
she
is
ill
an
much
you
care
she
likely
to
be
ill
moithered
as
is
from
mornin
to
night
wi
folks
as
had
better
be
elsewhere
do
you
mean
by
behaving
in
this
way
why
i
mean
as
the
missis
is
a
slavin
her
life
out
an
up
for
folks
as
are
better
able
to
wait
of
lyin

blessed
day
but
mek
work
the
room
and
do
be
insolent
i
better
be
insolent
than
like
what
some
folks
is
on
other
folks
an
bringin
a
bad
name
on
into
the
bargain
here
nanny
flung
out
of
the
room
leaving
the
lady
to
digest
this
unexpected
breakfast
at
her
leisure
the
countess
was
stunned
for
a
few
minutes
but
when
she
began
to
recall
nanny
words
there
was
no
possibility
of
avoiding
very
unpleasant
conclusions
from
them
or
of
failing
to
see
her
position
at
the
vicarage
in
an
entirely
new
light
the
interpretation
too
of
nanny
allusion
to
a
name
did
not
lie
out
of
the
reach
of
the
countess
imagination
and
she
saw
the
necessity
of
quitting
shepperton
without
delay
still
she
would
like
to
wait
for
her
brother
letter
no
she
would
ask
milly
to
forward
it
to
her
still
better
she
would
go
at
once
to
london
inquire
her
brother
address
at
his
banker
and
go
to
see
him
without
preliminary
she
went
up
to
milly
room
and
after
kisses
and
inquiries
said
find
on
consideration
dear
milly
from
the
letter
i
had
yesterday
that
i
must
bid
you
and
go
up
to
london
at
once
but
you
must
not
let
me
leave
you
ill
you
naughty
thing
no
said
milly
who
felt
as
if
a
load
had
been
taken
off
her
back
shall
be
very
well
in
an
hour
or
two
indeed
i
much
better
now
you
will
want
me
to
help
you
to
pack
but
you
wo
go
for
two
or
three
days
i
must
go
but
i
shall
not
let
you
help
me
to
pack
so
do
entertain
any
unreasonable
projects
but
lie
still
mr
brand
is
coming
nanny
says
the
news
was
not
an
unpleasant
surprise
to
barton
when
he
came
home
though
he
was
able
to
express
more
regret
at
the
idea
of
parting
than
milly
could
summon
to
her
lips
he
retained
more
of
his
original
feeling
for
the
countess
than
milly
did
for
women
never
betray
themselves
to
men
as
they
do
to
each
other
and
the
rev
amos
had
not
a
keen
instinct
for
character
but
he
felt
that
he
was
being
relieved
from
a
difficulty
and
in
the
way
that
was
easiest
for
him
neither
he
nor
milly
suspected
that
it
was
nanny
who
had
cut
the
knot
for
them
for
the
countess
took
care
to
give
no
sign
on
that
subject
as
for
nanny
she
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
relation
between
cause
and
effect
in
the
affair
and
secretly
chuckled
over
her
outburst
of
as
the
best
morning
work
she
had
ever
done
so
on
friday
morning
a
fly
was
seen
standing
at
the
vicarage
gate
with
the
countess
boxes
packed
upon
it
and
presently
that
lady
herself
was
seen
getting
into
the
vehicle
after
a
last
shake
of
the
hand
to
barton
and
last
kisses
to
milly
and
the
children
the
door
was
closed
and
as
the
fly
rolled
off
the
little
party
at
the
vicarage
gate
caught
a
last
glimpse
of
the
handsome
countess
leaning
and
waving
kisses
from
the
carriage
window
jet
little
black
phiz
was
also
seen
and
doubtless
he
had
his
thoughts
and
feelings
on
the
occasion
but
he
kept
them
strictly
within
his
own
bosom
the
schoolmistress
opposite
witnessed
this
departure
and
lost
no
time
in
telling
it
to
the
schoolmaster
who
again
communicated
the
news
to
the
landlord
of
jolly
colliers
at
the
close
of
the
morning
nanny
poured
the
joyful
tidings
into
the
ear
of
farquhar
footman
who
happened
to
call
with
a
letter
and
mr
brand
carried
them
to
all
the
patients
he
visited
that
morning
after
calling
on
barton
so
that
before
sunday
it
was
very
generally
known
in
shepperton
parish
that
the
countess
czerlaski
had
left
the
vicarage
the
countess
had
left
but
alas
the
bills
she
had
contributed
to
swell
still
remained
so
did
the
exiguity
of
the
children
clothing
which
also
was
partly
an
indirect
consequence
of
her
presence
and
so
too
did
the
coolness
and
alienation
in
the
parishioners
which
could
not
at
once
vanish
before
the
fact
of
her
departure
the
rev
amos
was
not
exculpated
the
past
was
not
expunged
but
what
was
worse
than
all
milly
health
gave
frequent
cause
for
alarm
and
the
prospect
of
birth
was
overshadowed
by
more
than
the
usual
fears
the
birth
came
prematurely
about
six
weeks
after
the
countess
departure
but
mr
brand
gave
favourable
reports
to
all
inquirers
on
the
following
day
which
was
saturday
on
sunday
after
morning
service
hackit
called
at
the
vicarage
to
inquire
how
barton
was
and
was
invited
to
see
her
milly
lay
placid
and
lovely
in
her
feebleness
and
held
out
her
hand
to
hackit
with
a
beaming
smile
it
was
very
pleasant
to
her
to
see
her
old
friend
unreserved
and
cordial
once
more
the
seven
baby
was
very
tiny
and
very
red
but
is
that
handsome
does
he
was
pronounced
to
be
well
and
hackit
went
home
gladdened
at
heart
to
think
that
the
perilous
hour
was
over
chapter
the
following
wednesday
when
and
hackit
were
seated
comfortably
by
their
bright
hearth
enjoying
the
long
afternoon
afforded
by
an
early
dinner
rachel
the
housemaid
came
in
and
said
you
please
the
shepherd
says
have
you
heard
as
barton
wuss
and
not
expected
to
live
hackit
turned
pale
and
hurried
out
to
question
the
shepherd
who
she
found
had
heard
the
sad
news
at
an
in
the
village
hackit
followed
her
out
and
said
better
have
the
and
go
directly
said
hackit
too
much
overcome
to
utter
any
exclamations
come
an
help

my
things
when
her
husband
was
wrapping
her
cloak
round
her
feet

the
she
said

shall
send

the
and
you
know
i
wanted

yes
it
was
a
bright
frosty
day
and
by
the
time
hackit
arrived
at
the
vicarage
the
sun
was
near
its
setting
there
was
a
carriage
and
pair
standing
at
the
gate
which
she
recognized
as
dr
madeley
the
physician
from
rotherby
she
entered
at
the
kitchen
door
that
she
might
avoid
knocking
and
quietly
question
nanny
no
one
was
in
the
kitchen
but
passing
on
she
saw
the
door
open
and
nanny
with
walter
in
her
arms
removing
the
knives
and
forks
which
had
been
laid
for

he
now
wi
dr
madeley
and
mr
brand
at
this
moment
hackit
heard
the
sound
of
a
heavy
slow
foot
in
the
passage
and
presently
amos
barton
entered
with
dry
despairing
eyes
haggard
and
unshaven
he
expected
to
find
the
as
he
left
it
with
nothing
to
meet
his
eyes
but
milly
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
and
the
children
toys
overturned
in
the
but
when
he
saw
hackit
come
towards
him
with
answering
sorrow
in
her
face
the
fountain
of
tears
was
opened
he
threw
himself
on
the
sofa
hid
his
face
and
sobbed
aloud
up
barton
hackit
ventured
to
say
at
last
up
for
the
sake
o
them
dear
children
children
said
amos
starting
up
must
be
sent
for
some
one

could
finish
the
sentence
but
hackit
understood
him
and
said
send
the
man
with
the
for
she
went
out
to
give
the
order
and
encountered
dr
madeley
and
mr
brand
who
were
just
going
mr
brand
said
am
very
glad
to
see

be
lost
in

the
children
barton

to
see
them

give
her
up
then
can
hardly
live
through
the
night
she
begged
us
to
tell
her
how
long
she
had
to
live
and
then
asked
for
the
children
the
was
sent
and
hackit
returning
to
barton
said
she
would
like
to
go
now
he
went
with
her
and
opened
the
door
the
chamber
fronted
the
west
the
sun
was
just
setting
and
the
red
light
fell
full
upon
the
bed
where
milly
lay
with
the
hand
of
death
visibly
upon
her
the
had
been
removed
and
she
lay
low
on
a
mattress
with
her
head
slightly
raised
by
pillows
her
long
fair
neck
seemed
to
be
struggling
with
a
painful
effort
her
features
were
pallid
and
pinched
and
her
eyes
were
closed
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
but
the
nurse
and
the
mistress
of
the
free
school
who
had
come
to
give
her
help
from
the
beginning
of
the
change
amos
and
hackit
stood
beside
the
bed
and
milly
opened
her
eyes
darling
hackit
is
come
to
see
you
milly
smiled
and
looked
at
her
with
that
strange
look
which
belongs
to
ebbing
life
the
children
coming
she
said
painfully
they
will
be
here
directly
she
closed
her
eyes
again
presently
the
was
heard
and
amos
motioning
to
hackit
to
follow
him
left
the
room
on
their
way
downstairs
she
suggested
that
the
carriage
should
remain
to
take
them
away
again
afterwards
and
amos
assented
there
they
stood
in
the
melancholy
the
five
sweet
children
from
patty
to
chubby
all
with
their
mother
eyes
all
except
patty
looking
up
with
a
vague
fear
at
their
father
as
he
entered
patty
understood
the
great
sorrow
that
was
come
upon
them
and
tried
to
check
her
sobs
as
she
heard
her
papa
footsteps
children
said
amos
taking
chubby
in
his
arms
is
going
to
take
away
your
dear
mamma
from
us
she
wants
to
see
you
to
say
you
must
try
to
be
very
good
and
not
cry
he
could
say
no
more
but
turned
round
to
see
if
nanny
was
there
with
walter
and
then
led
the
way
leading
dickey
with
the
other
hand
hackit
followed
with
sophy
and
patty
and
then
came
nanny
with
walter
and
fred
it
seemed
as
if
milly
had
heard
the
little
footsteps
on
the
stairs
for
when
amos
entered
her
eyes
were
wide
open
eagerly
looking
towards
the
door
they
all
stood
by
the
bedside
amos
nearest
to
her
holding
chubby
and
dickey
but
she
motioned
for
patty
to
come
first
and
clasping
the
poor
pale
child
by
the
hand
said
i
going
away
from
you
love
your
papa
comfort
him
and
take
care
of
your
little
brothers
and
sisters
god
will
help
you
patty
stood
perfectly
quiet
and
said
mamma
the
mother
motioned
with
her
pallid
lips
for
the
dear
child
to
lean
towards
her
and
kiss
her
and
then
patty
great
anguish
overcame
her
and
she
burst
into
sobs
amos
drew
her
towards
him
and
pressed
her
head
gently
to
him
while
milly
beckoned
fred
and
sophy
and
said
to
them
more
faintly
will
try
to
be
your
mamma
when
i
am
gone
my
darlings
you
will
be
good
and
not
vex
her
they
leaned
towards
her
and
she
stroked
their
fair
heads
and
kissed
their
cheeks
they
cried
because
mamma
was
ill
and
papa
looked
so
unhappy
but
they
thought
perhaps
next
week
things
would
be
as
they
used
to
be
again
the
little
ones
were
lifted
on
the
bed
to
kiss
her
little
walter
said
mamma
and
stretched
out
his
fat
arms
and
smiled
and
chubby
seemed
gravely
wondering
but
dickey
who
had
been
looking
fixedly
at
her
with
lip
hanging
down
ever
since
he
came
into
the
room
now
seemed
suddenly
pierced
with
the
idea
that
mamma
was
going
away
somewhere
his
little
heart
swelled
and
he
cried
aloud
then
hackit
and
nanny
took
them
all
away
patty
at
first
begged
to
stay
at
home
and
not
go
to
mrs
bond
again
but
when
nanny
reminded
her
that
she
had
better
go
to
take
care
of
the
younger
ones
she
submitted
at
once
and
they
were
all
packed
in
the
once
more
milly
kept
her
eyes
shut
for
some
time
after
the
children
were
gone
amos
had
sunk
on
his
knees
and
was
holding
her
hand
while
he
watched
her
face
she
opened
her
eyes
and
drawing
him
close
to
her
whispered
slowly
dear
dear
husband
you
have
been
very
good
to
me
you
have
made
me
very
happy
she
spoke
no
more
for
many
hours
they
watched
her
breathing
becoming
more
and
more
difficult
until
evening
deepened
into
night
and
until
midnight
was
past
about
twelve
she
seemed
to
be
trying
to
speak
and
they
leaned
to
catch
her
words
music
did
you
hear
it
amos
knelt
by
the
bed
and
held
her
hand
in
his
he
did
not
believe
in
his
sorrow
it
was
a
bad
dream
he
did
not
know
when
she
was
gone
but
mr
brand
whom
hackit
had
sent
for
before
twelve
thinking
that
barton
might
probably
need
his
help
now
came
up
to
him
and
said
feels
no
more
pain
now
come
my
dear
sir
come
with
me
is
shrieked
the
poor
desolate
man
struggling
to
shake
off
mr
brand
who
had
taken
him
by
the
arm
but
his
weary
weakened
frame
was
not
equal
to
resistance
and
he
was
dragged
out
of
the
room
chapter
they
laid
her
in
the
grave
the
sweet
mother
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
while
the
christmas
snow
lay
thick
upon
the
graves
it
was
cleves
who
buried
her
on
the
first
news
of
barton
calamity
he
had
ridden
over
from
tripplegate
to
beg
that
he
might
be
made
of
some
use
and
his
silent
grasp
of
amos
hand
had
penetrated
like
the
painful
thrill
of
warmth
to
the
poor
benumbed
heart
of
the
stricken
man
the
snow
lay
thick
upon
the
graves
and
the
day
was
cold
and
dreary
but
there
was
many
a
sad
eye
watching
that
black
procession
as
it
passed
from
the
vicarage
to
the
church
and
from
the
church
to
the
open
grave
there
were
men
and
women
standing
in
that
churchyard
who
had
bandied
vulgar
jests
about
their
pastor
and
who
had
lightly
charged
him
with
sin
but
now
when
they
saw
him
following
the
coffin
pale
and
haggard
he
was
consecrated
anew
by
his
great
sorrow
and
they
looked
at
him
with
respectful
pity
all
the
children
were
there
for
amos
had
willed
it
so
thinking
that
some
dim
memory
of
that
sacred
moment
might
remain
even
with
little
walter
and
link
itself
with
what
he
would
hear
of
his
sweet
mother
in
after
years
he
himself
led
patty
and
dickey
then
came
sophy
and
fred
mr
brand
had
begged
to
carry
chubby
and
nanny
followed
with
walter
they
made
a
circle
round
the
grave
while
the
coffin
was
being
lowered
patty
alone
of
all
the
children
felt
that
mamma
was
in
that
coffin
and
that
a
new
and
sadder
life
had
begun
for
papa
and
herself
she
was
pale
and
trembling
but
she
clasped
his
hand
more
firmly
as
the
coffin
went
down
and
gave
no
sob
fred
and
sophy
though
they
were
only
two
and
three
years
younger
and
though
they
had
seen
mamma
in
her
coffin
seemed
to
themselves
to
be
looking
at
some
strange
show
they
had
not
learned
to
decipher
that
terrible
handwriting
of
human
destiny
illness
and
death
dickey
had
rebelled
against
his
black
clothes
until
he
was
told
that
it
would
be
naughty
to
mamma
not
to
put
them
on
when
he
at
once
submitted
and
now
though
he
had
heard
nanny
say
that
mamma
was
in
heaven
he
had
a
vague
notion
that
she
would
come
home
again
tomorrow
and
say
he
had
been
a
good
boy
and
let
him
empty
her
he
stood
close
to
his
father
with
great
rosy
cheeks
and
wide
open
blue
eyes
looking
first
up
at
cleves
and
then
down
at
the
coffin
and
thinking
he
and
chubby
would
play
at
that
when
they
got
home
the
burial
was
over
and
amos
turned
with
his
children
to
the
house
the
house
where
an
hour
ago
milly
dear
body
lay
where
the
windows
were
half
darkened
and
sorrow
seemed
to
have
a
hallowed
precinct
for
itself
shut
out
from
the
world
but
now
she
was
gone
the
broad
daylight
was
in
all
the
rooms
the
vicarage
again
seemed
part
of
the
common
world
and
amos
for
the
first
time
felt
that
he
was
alone
that
day
after
day
month
after
month
year
after
year
would
have
to
be
lived
through
without
milly
love
spring
would
come
and
she
would
not
be
there
summer
and
she
would
not
be
there
and
he
would
never
have
her
again
with
him
by
the
fireside
in
the
long
evenings
the
seasons
all
seemed
irksome
to
his
thoughts
and
how
dreary
the
sunshiny
days
that
would
be
sure
to
come
she
was
gone
from
him
and
he
could
never
show
her
his
love
any
more
never
make
up
for
omissions
in
the
past
by
filling
future
days
with
tenderness
o
the
anguish
of
that
thought
that
we
can
never
atone
to
our
dead
for
the
stinted
affection
we
gave
them
for
the
light
answers
we
returned
to
their
plaints
or
their
pleadings
for
the
little
reverence
we
showed
to
that
sacred
human
soul
that
lived
so
close
to
us
and
was
the
divinest
thing
god
had
given
us
to
know
amos
barton
had
been
an
affectionate
husband
and
while
milly
was
with
him
he
was
never
visited
by
the
thought
that
perhaps
his
sympathy
with
her
was
not
quick
and
watchful
enough
but
now
he
all
their
life
together
with
that
terrible
keenness
of
memory
and
imagination
which
bereavement
gives
and
he
felt
as
if
his
very
love
needed
a
pardon
for
its
poverty
and
selfishness
no
outward
solace
could
counteract
the
bitterness
of
this
inward
woe
but
outward
solace
came
cold
faces
looked
kind
again
and
parishioners
turned
over
in
their
minds
what
they
could
best
do
to
help
their
pastor
oldinport
wrote
to
express
his
sympathy
and
enclosed
another
note
begging
that
he
might
be
permitted
to
contribute
in
this
way
to
the
relief
of
barton
mind
from
pecuniary
anxieties
under
the
pressure
of
a
grief
which
all
his
parishioners
must
share
and
offering
his
interest
towards
placing
the
two
eldest
girls
in
a
school
expressly
founded
for
clergymen
daughters
cleves
succeeded
in
collecting
thirty
pounds
among
his
richer
clerical
brethren
and
adding
ten
pounds
himself
sent
the
sum
to
amos
with
the
kindest
and
most
delicate
words
of
christian
fellowship
and
manly
friendship
miss
jackson
forgot
old
grievances
and
came
to
stay
some
months
with
children
bringing
such
material
aid
as
she
could
spare
from
her
small
income
these
were
substantial
helps
which
relieved
amos
from
the
pressure
of
his
money
difficulties
and
the
friendly
attentions
the
kind
pressure
of
the
hand
the
cordial
looks
he
met
with
everywhere
in
his
parish
made
him
feel
that
the
fatal
frost
which
had
settled
on
his
pastoral
duties
during
the
countess
residence
at
the
vicarage
was
completely
thawed
and
that
the
hearts
of
his
parishioners
were
once
more
open
to
him
no
one
breathed
the
countess
name
now
for
milly
memory
hallowed
her
husband
as
of
old
the
place
was
hallowed
on
which
an
angel
from
god
had
alighted
when
the
spring
came
hackit
begged
that
she
might
have
dickey
to
stay
with
her
and
great
was
the
enlargement
of
dickey
experience
from
that
visit
every
morning
he
was
allowed
being
well
wrapt
up
as
to
his
chest
by
hackit
own
hands
but
very
bare
and
red
as
to
his
legs
to
run
loose
in
the
cow
and
poultry
yard
to
persecute
the
by
satirical
imitations
of
his
and
to
put
difficult
questions
to
the
groom
as
to
the
reasons
why
horses
had
four
legs
and
other
transcendental
matters
then
hackit
would
take
dickey
up
on
horseback
when
he
rode
round
his
farm
and
hackit
had
a
large
plumcake
in
cut
ready
to
meet
incidental
attacks
of
hunger
so
that
dickey
had
considerably
modified
his
views
as
to
the
desirability
of
hackit
kisses
the
misses
farquhar
made
particular
pets
of
fred
and
sophy
to
whom
they
undertook
to
give
lessons
twice
in
writing
and
geography
and
farquhar
devised
many
treats
for
the
little
ones
patty
treat
was
to
stay
at
home
or
walk
about
with
her
papa
and
when
he
sat
by
the
fire
in
an
evening
after
the
other
children
were
gone
to
bed
she
would
bring
a
stool
and
placing
it
against
his
feet
would
sit
down
upon
it
and
lean
her
head
against
his
knee
then
his
hand
would
rest
on
that
fair
head
and
he
would
feel
that
milly
love
was
not
quite
gone
out
of
his
life
so
the
time
wore
on
till
it
was
may
again
and
the
church
was
quite
finished
and
reopened
in
all
its
new
splendour
and
barton
was
devoting
himself
with
more
vigour
than
ever
to
his
parochial
duties
but
one
morning
it
was
a
very
bright
morning
and
evil
tidings
sometimes
like
to
fly
in
the
finest
weather
there
came
a
letter
for
barton
addressed
in
the
vicar
handwriting
amos
opened
it
with
some
anxiety
somehow
or
other
he
had
a
presentiment
of
evil
the
letter
contained
the
announcement
that
carpe
had
resolved
on
coming
to
reside
at
shepperton
and
that
consequently
in
six
months
from
that
time
barton
duties
as
curate
in
that
parish
would
be
closed
o
it
was
hard
just
when
shepperton
had
become
the
place
where
he
most
wished
to
stay
where
he
had
friends
who
knew
his
sorrows
where
he
lived
close
to
milly
grave
to
part
from
that
grave
seemed
like
parting
with
milly
a
second
time
for
amos
was
one
who
clung
to
all
the
material
links
between
his
mind
and
the
past
his
imagination
was
not
vivid
and
required
the
stimulus
of
actual
perception
it
roused
some
bitter
feeling
too
to
think
that
carpe
wish
to
reside
at
shepperton
was
merely
a
pretext
for
removing
barton
in
order
that
he
might
ultimately
give
the
curacy
of
shepperton
to
his
own
who
was
known
to
be
wanting
a
new
position
still
it
must
be
borne
and
the
painful
business
of
seeking
another
curacy
must
be
set
about
without
loss
of
time
after
the
lapse
of
some
months
amos
was
obliged
to
renounce
the
hope
of
getting
one
at
all
near
shepperton
and
he
at
length
resigned
himself
to
accepting
one
in
a
distant
county
the
parish
was
in
a
large
manufacturing
town
where
his
walks
would
lie
among
noisy
streets
and
dingy
alleys
and
where
the
children
would
have
no
garden
to
play
in
no
pleasant
to
visit
it
was
another
blow
inflicted
on
the
bruised
man
chapter
at
length
the
dreaded
week
was
come
when
amos
and
his
children
must
leave
shepperton
there
was
general
regret
among
the
parishioners
at
his
departure
not
that
any
one
of
them
thought
his
spiritual
gifts
or
was
conscious
of
great
edification
from
his
ministry
but
his
recent
troubles
had
called
out
their
better
sympathies
and
that
is
always
a
source
of
love
amos
failed
to
touch
the
spring
of
goodness
by
his
sermons
but
he
touched
it
effectually
by
his
sorrows
and
there
was
now
a
real
bond
between
him
and
his
flock
heart
aches
for
them
poor
motherless
children
said
hackit
to
her
husband
among
strangers
and
into
a
nasty
town
where
there
no
good
victuals
to
be
had
and
you
must
pay
dear
to
get
bad
uns
hackit
had
a
vague
notion
of
a
town
life
as
a
combination
of
dirty
backyards
measly
pork
and
dingy
linen
the
same
sort
of
sympathy
was
strong
among
the
poorer
class
of
parishioners
old
tozer
who
was
still
able
to
earn
a
little
by
gardening
stopped
cramp
the
charwoman
on
her
way
home
from
the
vicarage
where
she
had
been
helping
nanny
to
pack
up
the
day
before
the
departure
and
inquired
very
particularly
into
barton
prospects
poor
mon
he
was
heard
to
say
sorry
for
un
he
hed
much
here
but
he
be
wuss
off
theer
half
a
loaf
better
nor
un
the
sad
had
all
been
said
before
that
last
evening
and
after
all
the
packing
was
done
and
all
the
arrangements
were
made
amos
felt
the
oppression
of
that
blank
interval
in
which
one
has
nothing
left
to
think
of
but
the
dreary
future
the
separation
from
the
loved
and
familiar
and
the
chilling
entrance
on
the
new
and
strange
in
every
parting
there
is
an
image
of
death
soon
after
ten
when
he
had
sent
nanny
to
bed
that
she
might
have
a
good
night
rest
before
the
fatigues
of
the
morrow
he
stole
softly
out
to
pay
a
last
visit
to
milly
grave
it
was
a
moonless
night
but
the
sky
was
thick
with
stars
and
their
light
was
enough
to
show
that
the
grass
had
grown
long
on
the
grave
and
that
there
was
a
tombstone
telling
in
bright
letters
on
a
dark
ground
that
beneath
were
deposited
the
remains
of
amelia
the
beloved
wife
of
amos
barton
who
died
in
the
year
of
her
age
leaving
a
husband
and
six
children
to
lament
her
loss
the
final
words
of
the
inscription
were
will
be
done
the
husband
was
now
advancing
towards
the
dear
mound
from
which
he
was
so
soon
to
be
parted
perhaps
for
ever
he
stood
a
few
minutes
reading
over
and
over
again
the
words
on
the
tombstone
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
all
the
happy
and
unhappy
past
was
a
reality
for
love
is
frightened
at
the
intervals
of
insensibility
and
callousness
that
encroach
by
little
and
little
on
the
dominion
of
grief
and
it
makes
efforts
to
recall
the
keenness
of
the
first
anguish
gradually
as
his
eye
dwelt
on
the
words
the
beloved
wife
the
waves
of
feeling
swelled
within
his
soul
and
he
threw
himself
on
the
grave
clasping
it
with
his
arms
and
kissing
the
cold
turf
milly
dost
thou
hear
me
i
did
love
thee
enough
i
tender
enough
to
thee
but
i
think
of
it
all
now
the
sobs
came
and
choked
his
utterance
and
the
warm
tears
fell
conclusion
only
once
again
in
his
life
has
amos
barton
visited
milly
grave
it
was
in
the
calm
and
softened
light
of
an
autumnal
afternoon
and
he
was
not
alone
he
held
on
his
arm
a
young
woman
with
a
sweet
grave
face
which
strongly
recalled
the
expression
of
barton
but
was
less
lovely
in
form
and
colour
she
was
about
thirty
but
there
were
some
premature
lines
round
her
mouth
and
eyes
which
told
of
early
anxiety
amos
himself
was
much
changed
his
thin
circlet
of
hair
was
nearly
white
and
his
walk
was
no
longer
firm
and
upright
but
his
glance
was
calm
and
even
cheerful
and
his
neat
linen
told
of
a
woman
care
milly
did
not
take
all
her
love
from
the
earth
when
she
died
she
had
left
some
of
it
in
patty
heart
all
the
other
children
were
now
grown
up
and
had
gone
their
several
ways
dickey
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
had
shown
remarkable
talents
as
an
engineer
his
cheeks
are
still
ruddy
in
spite
of
mixed
mathematics
and
his
eyes
are
still
large
and
blue
but
in
other
respects
his
person
would
present
no
marks
of
identification
for
his
friend
hackit
if
she
were
to
see
him
especially
now
that
her
eyes
must
be
grown
very
dim
with
the
wear
of
more
than
twenty
additional
years
he
is
nearly
six
feet
high
and
has
a
proportionately
broad
chest
he
wears
spectacles
and
rubs
his
large
white
hands
through
a
mass
of
shaggy
brown
hair
but
i
am
sure
you
have
no
doubt
that
richard
barton
is
a
thoroughly
good
fellow
as
well
as
a
man
of
talent
and
you
will
be
glad
any
day
to
shake
hands
with
him
for
his
own
sake
as
well
as
his
mother
patty
alone
remains
by
her
father
side
and
makes
the
evening
sunshine
of
his
life
gilfil
love
story
chapter
when
old
gilfil
died
thirty
years
ago
there
was
general
sorrow
in
shepperton
and
if
black
cloth
had
not
been
hung
round
the
pulpit
and
by
order
of
his
nephew
and
principal
legatee
the
parishioners
would
certainly
have
subscribed
the
necessary
sum
out
of
their
own
pockets
rather
than
allow
such
a
tribute
of
respect
to
be
wanting
all
the
farmers
wives
brought
out
their
black
bombasines
and
jennings
at
the
wharf
by
appearing
the
first
sunday
after
gilfil
death
in
her
ribbons
and
green
shawl
excited
the
severest
remark
to
be
sure
jennings
was
a
and
so
that
she
could
hardly
be
expected
to
have
very
clear
notions
of
what
was
proper
but
as
higgins
observed
in
an
undertone
to
parrot
when
they
were
coming
out
of
church
husband
been
born
i
the
parish
might
ha
told
her
better
an
unreadiness
to
put
on
black
on
all
available
occasions
or
too
great
an
alacrity
in
putting
it
off
argued
in
higgins
opinion
a
dangerous
levity
of
character
and
an
unnatural
insensibility
to
the
essential
fitness
of
things
folks
ca
to
put
off
their
colours
she
remarked
that
was
never
the
way
i
family
why
parrot
from
the
time
i
was
married
till
higgins
died
nine
years
ago
come
candlemas
i
niver
was
out
o
black
two
year
together
said
parrot
who
was
conscious
of
inferiority
in
this
respect
is
many
families
as
have
had
so
many
deaths
as
yours
mrs
higgins
higgins
who
was
an
elderly
widow
left
reflected
with
complacency
that
parrot
observation
was
no
more
than
just
and
that
jennings
very
likely
belonged
to
a
family
which
had
had
no
funerals
to
speak
of
even
dirty
dame
fripp
who
was
a
very
rare
had
been
to
hackit
to
beg
a
bit
of
old
crape
and
with
this
sign
of
grief
pinned
on
her
little
bonnet
was
seen
dropping
her
curtsy
opposite
the
this
manifestation
of
respect
towards
gilfil
memory
on
the
part
of
dame
fripp
had
no
theological
bearing
whatever
it
was
due
to
an
event
which
had
occurred
some
years
back
and
which
i
am
sorry
to
say
had
left
that
grimy
old
lady
as
indifferent
to
the
means
of
grace
as
ever
dame
fripp
kept
leeches
and
was
understood
to
have
such
remarkable
influence
over
those
wilful
animals
in
inducing
them
to
bite
under
the
most
unpromising
circumstances
that
though
her
own
leeches
were
usually
rejected
from
a
suspicion
that
they
had
lost
their
appetite
she
herself
was
constantly
called
in
to
apply
the
more
lively
individuals
furnished
from
pilgrim
surgery
when
as
was
very
often
the
case
one
of
that
clever
man
paying
patients
was
attacked
with
inflammation
thus
dame
fripp
in
addition
to
supposed
to
yield
her
no
less
than
was
in
the
receipt
of
professional
fees
the
gross
amount
of
which
was
vaguely
estimated
by
her
neighbours
as
pouns
moreover
she
drove
a
brisk
trade
in
lollipop
with
epicurean
urchins
who
recklessly
purchased
that
luxury
at
the
rate
of
two
hundred
per
cent
nevertheless
with
all
these
notorious
sources
of
income
the
shameless
old
woman
constantly
pleaded
poverty
and
begged
for
scraps
at
hackit
who
though
she
always
said
fripp
was
false
as
two
folks
and
no
better
than
a
miser
and
a
heathen
had
yet
a
leaning
towards
her
as
an
old
neighbour
that
old
judy
after
the
again
hackit
would
say
i
fool
enough
to
give
her
though
sally
wants
all
the
while
to
sweep
the
floors
with
such
was
dame
fripp
whom
gilfil
riding
leisurely
in
and
spurs
from
doing
duty
at
knebley
one
warm
sunday
afternoon
observed
sitting
in
the
dry
ditch
near
her
cottage
and
by
her
side
a
large
pig
who
with
that
ease
and
confidence
belonging
to
perfect
friendship
was
lying
with
his
head
in
her
lap
and
making
no
effort
to
play
the
agreeable
beyond
an
occasional
grunt
fripp
said
the
vicar
did
know
you
had
such
a
fine
pig
you
have
some
rare
flitches
at
christmas
god
forbid
my
son
gev
him
me
two
ago
an
he
been
company
to
me
iver
sin
i
could
find
i
my
heart
to
part
wi
if
i
niver
knowed
the
taste
o
again
he
eat
his
head
off
and
yours
too
how
can
you
go
on
keeping
a
pig
and
making
nothing
by
him
he
picks
a
bit
hisself
wi
rootin
and
i
dooant
mind
doing
to
gi
him
summat
a
bit
o
company
meat
an
drink
too
an
he
follers
me
about
and
grunts
when
i
spake
to
just
like
a
christian
gilfil
laughed
and
i
am
obliged
to
admit
that
he
said
to
dame
fripp
without
asking
her
why
she
had
not
been
to
church
or
making
the
slightest
effort
for
her
spiritual
edification
but
the
next
day
he
ordered
his
man
david
to
take
her
a
great
piece
of
bacon
with
a
message
saying
the
parson
wanted
to
make
sure
that
fripp
would
know
the
taste
of
again
so
when
gilfil
died
dame
fripp
manifested
her
gratitude
and
reverence
in
the
simply
dingy
fashion
i
have
mentioned
you
already
suspect
that
the
vicar
did
not
shine
in
the
more
spiritual
functions
of
his
office
and
indeed
the
utmost
i
can
say
for
him
in
this
respect
is
that
he
performed
those
functions
with
undeviating
attention
to
brevity
and
despatch
he
had
a
large
heap
of
short
sermons
rather
yellow
and
worn
at
the
edges
from
which
he
took
two
every
sunday
securing
perfect
impartiality
in
the
selection
by
taking
them
as
they
came
without
reference
to
topics
and
having
preached
one
of
these
sermons
at
shepperton
in
the
morning
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
hastily
with
the
other
in
his
pocket
to
knebley
where
he
officiated
in
a
wonderful
little
church
with
a
checkered
pavement
which
had
once
rung
to
the
iron
tread
of
military
monks
with
coats
of
arms
in
clusters
on
the
lofty
roof
marble
warriors
and
their
wives
without
noses
occupying
a
large
proportion
of
the
area
and
the
twelve
apostles
with
their
heads
very
much
on
one
side
holding
didactic
ribbons
painted
in
fresco
on
the
walls
here
in
an
absence
of
mind
to
which
he
was
prone
gilfil
would
sometimes
forget
to
take
off
his
spurs
before
putting
on
his
surplice
and
only
become
aware
of
the
omission
by
feeling
something
mysteriously
tugging
at
the
skirts
of
that
garment
as
he
stepped
into
the
but
the
knebley
farmers
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
criticizing
the
moon
as
their
pastor
he
belonged
to
the
course
of
nature
like
markets
and
and
dirty
and
being
a
vicar
his
claim
on
their
veneration
had
never
been
counteracted
by
an
exasperating
claim
on
their
pockets
some
of
them
who
did
not
indulge
in
the
superfluity
of
a
covered
cart
without
springs
had
dined
half
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
that
is
to
say
at
twelve
in
order
to
have
time
for
their
long
walk
through
miry
lanes
and
present
themselves
duly
in
their
places
at
two
when
oldinport
and
lady
felicia
to
whom
knebley
church
was
a
sort
of
family
temple
made
their
way
among
the
bows
and
curtsies
of
their
dependants
to
a
carved
and
canopied
pew
in
the
chancel
diffusing
as
they
went
a
delicate
odour
of
indian
roses
on
the
unsusceptible
nostrils
of
the
congregation
the
farmers
wives
and
children
sat
on
the
dark
oaken
benches
but
the
husbands
usually
chose
the
distinctive
dignity
of
a
stall
under
one
of
the
twelve
apostles
where
when
the
alternation
of
prayers
and
responses
had
given
place
to
the
agreeable
monotony
of
the
sermon
paterfamilias
might
be
seen
or
heard
sinking
into
a
pleasant
doze
from
which
he
infallibly
woke
up
at
the
sound
of
the
concluding
doxology
and
then
they
made
their
way
back
again
through
the
miry
lanes
perhaps
almost
as
much
the
better
for
this
simple
weekly
tribute
to
what
they
knew
of
good
and
right
as
many
a
more
wakeful
and
critical
congregation
of
the
present
day
gilfil
too
used
to
make
his
way
home
in
the
later
years
of
his
life
for
he
had
given
up
the
habit
of
dining
at
knebley
abbey
on
a
sunday
having
i
am
sorry
to
say
had
a
very
bitter
quarrel
with
oldinport
the
cousin
and
predecessor
of
the
oldinport
who
flourished
in
the
rev
amos
barton
time
that
quarrel
was
a
sad
pity
for
the
two
had
had
many
a
good
day
hunting
together
when
they
were
younger
and
in
those
friendly
times
not
a
few
members
of
the
hunt
envied
oldinport
the
excellent
terms
he
was
on
with
his
vicar
for
as
sir
jasper
sitwell
observed
to
a
man
wife
there
nobody
can
be
such
an
infernal
plague
to
you
as
a
parson
always
under
your
nose
on
your
own
estate
i
fancy
the
original
difference
which
led
to
the
rupture
was
very
slight
but
gilfil
was
of
an
extremely
caustic
turn
his
satire
having
a
flavour
of
originality
which
was
quite
wanting
in
his
sermons
and
as
oldinport
armour
of
conscious
virtue
presented
some
considerable
and
conspicuous
gaps
the
vicar
retorts
probably
made
a
few
incisions
too
deep
to
be
forgiven
such
at
least
was
the
view
of
the
case
presented
by
hackit
who
knew
as
much
of
the
matter
as
any
third
person
for
the
very
week
after
the
quarrel
when
presiding
at
the
annual
dinner
of
the
association
for
the
prosecution
of
felons
held
at
the
oldinport
arms
he
contributed
an
additional
zest
to
the
conviviality
on
that
occasion
by
informing
the
company
that
parson
had
given
the
squire
a
lick
with
the
rough
side
of
his
tongue
the
detection
of
the
person
or
persons
who
had
driven
off
parrot
heifer
could
hardly
have
been
more
welcome
news
to
the
shepperton
tenantry
with
whom
oldinport
was
in
the
worst
odour
as
a
landlord
having
kept
up
his
rents
in
spite
of
falling
prices
and
not
being
in
the
least
stung
to
emulation
by
paragraphs
in
the
provincial
newspapers
stating
that
the
honourable
augustus
purwell
or
viscount
blethers
had
made
a
return
of
ten
per
cent
on
their
last
the
fact
was
oldinport
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
standing
for
parliament
whereas
he
had
the
strongest
intention
of
adding
to
his
unentailed
estate
hence
to
the
shepperton
farmers
it
was
as
good
as
lemon
with
their
grog
to
know
that
the
vicar
had
thrown
out
sarcasms
against
the
squire
charities
as
little
better
than
those
of
the
man
who
stole
a
goose
and
gave
away
the
giblets
in
alms
for
shepperton
you
observe
was
in
a
state
of
attic
culture
compared
with
knebley
it
had
turnpike
roads
and
a
public
opinion
whereas
in
the
boeotian
knebley
men
minds
and
waggons
alike
moved
in
the
deepest
of
ruts
and
the
landlord
was
only
grumbled
at
as
a
necessary
and
unalterable
evil
like
the
weather
the
weevils
and
the
thus
in
shepperton
this
breach
with
oldinport
tended
only
to
heighten
that
good
understanding
which
the
vicar
had
always
enjoyed
with
the
rest
of
his
parishioners
from
the
generation
whose
children
he
had
christened
a
quarter
of
a
century
before
down
to
that
hopeful
generation
represented
by
little
tommy
bond
who
had
recently
quitted
frocks
and
trousers
for
the
severe
simplicity
of
a
tight
suit
of
corduroys
relieved
by
numerous
brass
buttons
tommy
was
a
saucy
boy
impervious
to
all
impressions
of
reverence
and
excessively
addicted
to
and
marbles
with
which
recreative
resources
he
was
in
the
habit
of
immoderately
distending
the
pockets
of
his
corduroys
one
day
spinning
his
top
on
the
and
seeing
the
vicar
advance
directly
towards
it
at
that
exciting
moment
when
it
was
beginning
to
magnificently
he
shouted
out
with
all
the
force
of
his
lungs
do
knock
my
top
down
now
from
that
day
corduroys
had
been
an
especial
favourite
with
gilfil
who
delighted
to
provoke
his
ready
scorn
and
wonder
by
putting
questions
which
gave
tommy
the
meanest
opinion
of
his
intellect
little
corduroys
have
they
milked
the
geese
today
the
geese
why
they
do
milk
the
geese
you
silly
dear
heart
why
how
do
the
goslings
live
then
the
nutriment
of
goslings
rather
transcending
tommy
observations
in
natural
history
he
feigned
to
understand
this
question
in
an
exclamatory
rather
than
an
interrogatory
sense
and
became
absorbed
in
winding
up
his
top
i
see
you
do
know
how
the
goslings
live
but
did
you
notice
how
it
rained
yesterday
here
tommy
became
attentive
they
fell
into
my
pocket
as
i
rode
along
you
look
in
my
pocket
and
see
if
they
did
tommy
without
waiting
to
discuss
the
alleged
antecedent
lost
no
time
in
ascertaining
the
presence
of
the
agreeable
consequent
for
he
had
a
belief
in
the
advantages
of
diving
into
the
vicar
pocket
gilfil
called
it
his
wonderful
pocket
because
as
he
delighted
to
tell
the
shavers
and
so
he
called
all
little
boys
and
girls
whenever
he
put
pennies
into
it
they
turned
into
or
gingerbread
or
some
other
nice
thing
indeed
little
bessie
parrot
a
very
white
and
fat
as
to
her
neck
always
had
the
admirable
directness
and
sincerity
to
salute
him
with
the
question
zoo
dot
in
zoo
pottet
you
can
imagine
then
that
the
christening
dinners
were
none
the
less
merry
for
the
presence
of
the
parson
the
farmers
relished
his
society
particularly
for
he
could
not
only
smoke
his
pipe
and
season
the
details
of
parish
affairs
with
abundance
of
caustic
jokes
and
proverbs
but
as
mr
bond
often
said
no
man
knew
more
than
the
vicar
about
the
breed
of
cows
and
horses
he
had
of
his
own
about
five
miles
off
which
a
bailiff
ostensibly
a
tenant
farmed
under
his
direction
and
to
ride
backwards
and
forwards
and
look
after
the
buying
and
selling
of
stock
was
the
old
gentleman
chief
relaxation
now
his
hunting
days
were
over
to
hear
him
discussing
the
respective
merits
of
the
devonshire
breed
and
the
or
the
last
foolish
decision
of
the
magistrates
about
a
pauper
a
superficial
observer
might
have
seen
little
difference
beyond
his
superior
shrewdness
between
the
vicar
and
his
bucolic
parishioners
for
it
was
his
habit
to
approximate
his
accent
and
mode
of
speech
to
theirs
doubtless
because
he
thought
it
a
mere
frustration
of
the
purposes
of
language
to
talk
of
and
to
men
who
habitually
said
and
nevertheless
the
farmers
themselves
were
perfectly
aware
of
the
distinction
between
them
and
the
parson
and
had
not
at
all
the
less
belief
in
him
as
a
gentleman
and
a
clergyman
for
his
easy
speech
and
familiar
manners
parrot
smoothed
her
apron
and
set
her
cap
right
with
the
utmost
solicitude
when
she
saw
the
vicar
coming
made
him
her
deepest
curtsy
and
every
christmas
had
a
fat
turkey
ready
to
send
him
with
her
and
in
the
most
gossiping
colloquies
with
gilfil
you
might
have
observed
that
both
men
and
women
their
words
and
never
became
indifferent
to
his
approbation
the
same
respect
attended
him
in
his
strictly
clerical
functions
the
benefits
of
baptism
were
supposed
to
be
somehow
bound
up
with
gilfil
personality
so
metaphysical
a
distinction
as
that
between
a
man
and
his
office
being
as
yet
quite
foreign
to
the
mind
of
a
good
shepperton
churchman
savouring
he
would
have
thought
of
dissent
on
the
very
face
of
it
miss
selina
parrot
put
off
her
marriage
a
whole
month
when
gilfil
had
an
attack
of
rheumatism
rather
than
be
married
in
a
makeshift
manner
by
the
milby
curate
had
a
very
good
sermon
this
morning
was
the
frequent
remark
after
hearing
one
of
the
old
yellow
series
heard
with
all
the
more
satisfaction
because
it
had
been
heard
for
the
twentieth
time
for
to
minds
on
the
shepperton
level
it
is
repetition
not
novelty
that
produces
the
strongest
effect
and
phrases
like
tunes
are
a
long
time
making
themselves
at
home
in
the
brain
gilfil
sermons
as
you
may
imagine
were
not
of
a
highly
doctrinal
still
less
of
a
polemical
cast
they
perhaps
did
not
search
the
conscience
very
powerfully
for
you
remember
that
to
patten
who
had
listened
to
them
thirty
years
the
announcement
that
she
was
a
sinner
appeared
an
uncivil
heresy
but
on
the
other
hand
they
made
no
unreasonable
demand
on
the
shepperton
intellect
amounting
indeed
to
little
more
than
an
expansion
of
the
concise
thesis
that
those
who
do
wrong
will
find
it
the
worse
for
them
and
those
who
do
well
will
find
it
the
better
for
them
the
nature
of
being
exposed
in
special
sermons
against
lying
backbiting
anger
slothfulness
and
the
like
and
being
interpreted
as
honesty
truthfulness
charity
industry
and
other
common
virtues
lying
quite
on
the
surface
of
life
and
having
very
little
to
do
with
deep
spiritual
doctrine
patten
understood
that
if
she
turned
out
cheeses
a
just
retribution
awaited
her
though
i
fear
she
made
no
particular
application
of
the
sermon
on
backbiting
hackit
expressed
herself
greatly
edified
by
the
sermon
on
honesty
the
allusion
to
the
unjust
weight
and
deceitful
balance
having
a
peculiar
lucidity
for
her
owing
to
a
recent
dispute
with
her
grocer
but
i
am
not
aware
that
she
ever
appeared
to
be
much
struck
by
the
sermon
on
anger
as
to
any
suspicion
that
gilfil
did
not
dispense
the
pure
gospel
or
any
strictures
on
his
doctrine
and
mode
of
delivery
such
thoughts
never
visited
the
minds
of
the
shepperton
parishioners
of
those
very
parishioners
who
ten
or
fifteen
years
later
showed
themselves
extremely
critical
of
barton
discourses
and
demeanour
but
in
the
interim
they
had
tasted
that
dangerous
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
innovation
which
is
well
known
to
open
the
eyes
even
in
an
uncomfortable
manner
at
present
to
find
fault
with
the
sermon
was
regarded
as
almost
equivalent
to
finding
fault
with
religion
itself
one
sunday
hackit
nephew
master
tom
stokes
a
flippant
town
youth
greatly
scandalized
his
excellent
relatives
by
declaring
that
he
could
write
as
good
a
sermon
as
gilfil
whereupon
hackit
sought
to
reduce
the
presumptuous
youth
to
utter
confusion
by
offering
him
a
sovereign
if
he
would
fulfil
his
vaunt
the
sermon
was
written
however
and
though
it
was
not
admitted
to
be
anywhere
within
reach
of
gilfil
it
was
yet
so
astonishingly
like
a
sermon
having
a
text
three
divisions
and
a
concluding
exhortation
beginning
now
my
brethren
that
the
sovereign
though
denied
formally
was
bestowed
informally
and
the
sermon
was
pronounced
when
master
stokes
back
was
turned
to
be
uncommon
cliver
thing
the
rev
pickard
indeed
of
the
independent
meeting
had
stated
in
a
sermon
preached
at
rotheby
for
the
reduction
of
a
debt
on
new
zion
built
with
an
exuberance
of
faith
and
a
deficiency
of
funds
by
seceders
from
the
original
zion
that
he
lived
in
a
parish
where
the
vicar
was
very
and
in
the
prayers
he
addressed
to
his
own
congregation
he
was
in
the
habit
of
comprehensively
alluding
to
the
parishioners
outside
the
chapel
walls
as
those
who
cared
for
none
of
these
things
but
i
need
hardly
say
that
no
ever
came
within
earshot
of
pickard
it
was
not
to
the
shepperton
farmers
only
that
gilfil
society
was
acceptable
he
was
a
welcome
guest
at
some
of
the
best
houses
in
that
part
of
the
country
old
sir
jasper
sitwell
would
have
been
glad
to
see
him
every
week
and
if
you
had
seen
him
conducting
lady
sitwell
in
to
dinner
or
had
heard
him
talking
to
her
with
quaint
yet
graceful
gallantry
you
would
have
inferred
that
the
earlier
period
of
his
life
had
been
passed
in
more
stately
society
than
could
be
found
in
shepperton
and
that
his
slipshod
chat
and
homely
manners
were
but
like
on
a
fine
old
block
of
marble
allowing
you
still
to
see
here
and
there
the
fineness
of
the
grain
and
the
delicacy
of
the
original
tint
but
in
his
later
years
these
visits
became
a
little
too
troublesome
to
the
old
gentleman
and
he
was
rarely
to
be
found
anywhere
of
an
evening
beyond
the
bounds
of
his
own
parish
most
frequently
indeed
by
the
side
of
his
own
fire
smoking
his
pipe
and
maintaining
the
pleasing
antithesis
of
dryness
and
moisture
by
an
occasional
sip
of
here
i
am
aware
that
i
have
run
the
risk
of
alienating
all
my
refined
and
utterly
annihilating
any
curiosity
they
may
have
felt
to
know
the
details
of
gilfil
foh
you
may
as
well
ask
us
to
interest
ourselves
in
the
romance
of
a
who
mingles
the
image
of
his
beloved
with
short
dips
and
moulds
but
in
the
first
place
dear
ladies
allow
me
to
plead
that
like
obesity
or
baldness
or
the
gout
does
not
exclude
a
vast
amount
of
antecedent
romance
any
more
than
the
which
you
may
some
day
wear
will
exclude
your
present
possession
of
less
expensive
braids
alas
alas
we
poor
mortals
are
often
little
better
than
there
is
small
sign
of
the
sap
and
the
leafy
freshness
and
the
bursting
buds
that
were
once
there
but
wherever
we
see
we
know
that
all
that
early
fullness
of
life
must
have
been
i
at
least
hardly
ever
look
at
a
bent
old
man
or
a
wizened
old
woman
but
i
see
also
with
my
mind
eye
that
past
of
which
they
are
the
shrunken
remnant
and
the
unfinished
romance
of
rosy
cheeks
and
bright
eyes
seems
sometimes
of
feeble
interest
and
significance
compared
with
that
drama
of
hope
and
love
which
has
long
ago
reached
its
catastrophe
and
left
the
poor
soul
like
a
dim
and
dusty
stage
with
all
its
sweet
and
fair
perspectives
overturned
and
thrust
out
of
sight
in
the
second
place
let
me
assure
you
that
gilfil
potations
of
were
quite
moderate
his
nose
was
not
rubicund
on
the
contrary
his
white
hair
hung
around
a
pale
and
venerable
face
he
drank
it
chiefly
i
believe
because
it
was
cheap
and
here
i
find
myself
alighting
on
another
of
the
vicar
weaknesses
which
if
i
had
cared
to
paint
a
flattering
portrait
rather
than
a
faithful
one
i
might
have
chosen
to
suppress
it
is
undeniable
that
as
the
years
advanced
gilfil
became
as
hackit
observed
more
and
more
though
the
growing
propensity
showed
itself
rather
in
the
parsimony
of
his
personal
habits
than
in
withholding
help
from
the
needy
he
was
saving
so
he
represented
the
matter
to
himself
for
a
nephew
the
only
son
of
a
sister
who
had
been
the
dearest
object
all
but
one
in
his
life
lad
he
thought
have
a
nice
little
fortune
to
begin
life
with
and
will
bring
his
pretty
young
wife
some
day
to
see
the
spot
where
his
old
uncle
lies
it
will
perhaps
be
all
the
better
for
his
hearth
that
mine
was
lonely
gilfil
was
a
bachelor
then
that
is
the
conclusion
to
which
you
would
probably
have
come
if
you
had
entered
his
where
the
bare
tables
the
large
chairs
and
the
threadbare
turkey
carpet
perpetually
fumigated
with
tobacco
seemed
to
tell
a
story
of
wifeless
existence
that
was
contradicted
by
no
portrait
no
piece
of
embroidery
no
faded
bit
of
pretty
triviality
hinting
of
and
small
feminine
ambitions
and
it
was
here
that
gilfil
passed
his
evenings
seldom
with
other
society
than
that
of
ponto
his
old
brown
setter
who
stretched
out
at
full
length
on
the
rug
with
his
nose
between
his
would
wrinkle
his
brows
and
lift
up
his
eyelids
every
now
and
then
to
exchange
a
glance
of
mutual
understanding
with
his
master
but
there
was
a
chamber
in
shepperton
vicarage
which
told
a
different
story
from
that
bare
and
cheerless
a
chamber
never
entered
by
any
one
besides
gilfil
and
old
martha
the
housekeeper
who
with
david
her
husband
as
groom
and
gardener
formed
the
vicar
entire
establishment
the
blinds
of
this
chamber
were
always
down
except
once
when
martha
entered
that
she
might
air
and
clean
it
she
always
asked
gilfil
for
the
key
which
he
kept
locked
up
in
his
bureau
and
returned
it
to
him
when
she
had
finished
her
task
it
was
a
touching
sight
that
the
daylight
streamed
in
upon
as
martha
drew
aside
the
blinds
and
thick
curtains
and
opened
the
gothic
casement
of
the
oriel
window
on
the
little
there
was
a
dainty
in
a
carved
and
gilt
frame
bits
of
were
still
in
the
branched
sockets
at
the
sides
and
on
one
of
these
branches
hung
a
little
black
lace
kerchief
a
faded
satin
with
the
pins
rusted
in
it
a
and
a
large
green
fan
lay
on
the
table
and
on
a
by
the
side
of
the
glass
was
a
and
an
unfinished
yellow
with
age
lying
in
it
two
gowns
of
a
fashion
long
forgotten
were
hanging
on
nails
against
the
door
and
a
pair
of
tiny
red
slippers
with
a
bit
of
tarnished
silver
embroidery
on
them
were
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
two
or
three
drawings
views
of
naples
hung
upon
the
walls
and
over
the
mantelpiece
above
some
bits
of
rare
old
china
two
miniatures
in
oval
frames
one
of
these
miniatures
represented
a
young
man
about
with
a
sanguine
complexion
full
lips
and
clear
candid
grey
eyes
the
other
was
the
likeness
of
a
girl
probably
not
more
than
eighteen
with
small
features
thin
cheeks
a
pale
complexion
and
large
dark
eyes
the
gentleman
wore
powder
the
lady
had
her
dark
hair
gathered
away
from
her
face
and
a
little
cap
with
a
bow
set
on
the
top
of
her
head
a
coquettish
but
the
eyes
spoke
of
sadness
rather
than
of
coquetry
such
were
the
things
that
martha
had
dusted
and
let
the
air
upon
four
times
ever
since
she
was
a
blooming
lass
of
twenty
and
she
was
now
in
this
last
decade
of
gilfil
life
unquestionably
on
the
wrong
side
of
fifty
such
was
the
chamber
in
house
a
sort
of
visible
symbol
of
the
secret
chamber
in
his
heart
where
he
had
long
turned
the
key
on
early
hopes
and
early
sorrows
shutting
up
for
ever
all
the
passion
and
the
poetry
of
his
life
there
were
not
many
people
in
the
parish
besides
martha
who
had
any
very
distinct
remembrance
of
gilfil
wife
or
indeed
who
knew
anything
of
her
beyond
the
fact
that
there
was
a
marble
tablet
with
a
latin
inscription
in
memory
of
her
over
the
vicarage
pew
the
parishioners
who
were
old
enough
to
remember
her
arrival
were
not
generally
gifted
with
descriptive
powers
and
the
utmost
you
could
gather
from
them
was
that
gilfil
looked
like
a
wi
such
eyes
you
ca
think
an
a
voice
as
went
through
you
when
she
sung
at
church
the
one
exception
was
patten
whose
strong
memory
and
taste
for
personal
narrative
made
her
a
great
source
of
oral
tradition
in
shepperton
hackit
who
had
not
come
into
the
parish
until
ten
years
after
gilfil
death
would
often
put
old
questions
to
patten
for
the
sake
of
getting
the
old
answers
which
pleased
him
in
the
same
way
as
passages
from
a
favourite
book
or
the
scenes
of
a
familiar
play
please
more
accomplished
people
you
remember
well
the
sunday
as
gilfil
first
come
to
church
eh
mrs
patten
be
sure
i
do
it
was
a
fine
bright
sunday
as
ever
was
seen
just
at
the
beginnin
o
hay
harvest
tarbett
preached
that
day
and
gilfil
sat
i
the
pew
with
his
wife
i
think
i
see
him
now
her
up
the
aisle
an
her
head
not
reachin
much
above
his
elber
a
little
pale
woman
with
eyes
as
black
as
sloes
an
yet
lookin
as
if
she
see
nothing
with
warrant
she
had
her
weddin
clothes
on
said
hackit
partikler
smart
a
white
hat
tied
down
under
her
chin
a
white
indy
muslin
gown
but
you
do
know
what
gilfil
was
in
those
times
he
was
fine
an
altered
before
you
come
into
the
parish
he
a
fresh
colour
then
an
a
bright
look
wi
his
eyes
as
did
your
heart
good
to
see
he
looked
rare
and
happy
that
sunday
but
somehow
i
a
as
it
would
last
long
i
no
opinion
o
furriners
hackit
for
i
travelled
i
their
country
with
my
lady
in
my
time
an
seen
enough
o
their
victuals
an
their
nasty
ways
gilfil
come
from
did
she
reckon
she
did
but
i
niver
could
rightly
hear
about
that
gilfil
was
niver
to
be
spoke
to
about
her
and
nobody
else
hereabout
knowed
anythin
howiver
she
must
ha
come
over
pretty
young
for
she
spoke
english
as
well
as
you
an
me
it
them
italians
as
has
such
fine
voices
an
gilfil
sung
you
never
heared
the
like
he
brought
her
here
to
have
tea
with
me
one
afternoon
and
says
he
in
his
jovial
way
now
patten
i
want
gilfil
to
see
the
neatest
house
and
drink
the
best
cup
o
tea
in
all
shepperton
you
must
show
her
your
dairy
and
your
and
then
she
shall
sing
you
a
song
an
so
she
did
an
her
voice
seemed
sometimes
to
fill
the
room
an
then
it
went
low
soft
as
if
it
was
whisperin
close
to
your
heart
like
never
heared
her
again
i
reckon
she
was
sickly
then
and
she
died
in
a
few
months
after
she
in
the
parish
much
more
nor
half
a
year
altogether
she
did
seem
lively
that
afternoon
an
i
could
see
she
did
care
about
the
dairy
nor
the
cheeses
she
pretended
to
please
him
as
for
him
i
niver
see
a
man
so
wrapt
up
in
a
woman
he
looked
at
her
as
if
he
was
worshippin
her
an
as
if
he
wanted
to
lift
her
off
the
ground
ivery
minute
to
save
her
the
trouble
o
walkin
poor
man
poor
man
it
had
like
to
ha
killed
him
when
she
died
though
he
niver
gev
way
but
went
on
ridin
about
and
preachin
but
he
was
wore
to
a
shadder
an
his
eyes
used
to
look
as
dead
you
would
ha
knowed
brought
him
no
fortune
she
all
gilfil
property
come
by
his
mother
side
there
was
blood
an
money
too
there
it
a
thousand
pities
as
he
married
i
that
way
a
fine
man
like
him
as
might
ha
had
the
pick
o
the
county
had
his
grandchildren
about
him
now
an
him
so
fond
o
children
too
in
this
manner
patten
usually
wound
up
her
reminiscences
of
the
vicar
wife
of
whom
you
perceive
she
knew
but
little
it
was
clear
that
the
communicative
old
lady
had
nothing
to
tell
of
history
previous
to
her
arrival
in
shepperton
and
that
she
was
unacquainted
with
gilfil
but
i
dear
reader
am
quite
as
communicative
as
patten
and
much
better
informed
so
that
if
you
care
to
know
more
about
the
courtship
and
marriage
you
need
only
carry
your
imagination
back
to
the
latter
end
of
the
last
century
and
your
attention
forward
into
the
next
chapter
chapter
it
is
the
evening
of
the
of
june
the
day
has
been
bright
and
sultry
and
the
sun
will
still
be
more
than
an
hour
above
the
horizon
but
his
rays
broken
by
the
leafy
fretwork
of
the
elms
that
border
the
park
no
longer
prevent
two
ladies
from
carrying
out
their
cushions
and
embroidery
and
seating
themselves
to
work
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
cheverel
manor
the
soft
turf
gives
way
even
under
the
fairy
tread
of
the
younger
lady
whose
small
stature
and
slim
figure
rest
on
the
tiniest
of
feet
she
trips
along
before
the
elder
carrying
the
cushions
which
she
places
in
the
favourite
spot
just
on
the
slope
by
a
clump
of
laurels
where
they
can
see
the
sunbeams
sparkling
among
the
and
can
be
themselves
seen
from
the
windows
she
has
deposited
the
cushions
and
now
turns
round
so
that
you
may
have
a
full
view
of
her
as
she
stands
waiting
the
slower
advance
of
the
elder
lady
you
are
at
once
arrested
by
her
large
dark
eyes
which
in
their
inexpressive
unconscious
beauty
resemble
the
eyes
of
a
fawn
and
it
is
only
by
an
effort
of
attention
that
you
notice
the
absence
of
bloom
on
her
young
cheek
and
the
southern
yellowish
tint
of
her
small
neck
and
face
rising
above
the
little
black
lace
kerchief
which
prevents
the
too
immediate
comparison
of
her
skin
with
her
white
muslin
gown
her
large
eyes
seem
all
the
more
striking
because
the
dark
hair
is
gathered
away
from
her
face
under
a
little
cap
set
at
the
top
of
her
head
with
a
bow
on
one
side
the
elder
lady
who
is
advancing
towards
the
cushions
is
cast
in
a
very
different
mould
of
womanhood
she
is
tall
and
looks
the
taller
because
her
powdered
hair
is
turned
backward
over
a
toupee
and
surmounted
by
lace
and
ribbons
she
is
nearly
fifty
but
her
complexion
is
still
fresh
and
beautiful
with
the
beauty
of
an
auburn
blond
her
proud
pouting
lips
and
her
head
thrown
a
little
backward
as
she
walks
give
an
expression
of
hauteur
which
is
not
contradicted
by
the
cold
grey
eye
the
kerchief
rising
full
over
the
low
tight
bodice
of
her
blue
dress
sets
off
the
majestic
form
of
her
bust
and
she
treads
the
lawn
as
if
she
were
one
of
sir
joshua
reynolds
stately
ladies
who
had
suddenly
stepped
from
her
frame
to
enjoy
the
evening
cool
the
cushions
lower
caterina
that
we
may
not
have
so
much
sun
upon
us
she
called
out
in
a
tone
of
authority
when
still
at
some
distance
caterina
obeyed
and
they
sat
down
making
two
bright
patches
of
red
and
white
and
blue
on
the
green
background
of
the
laurels
and
the
lawn
which
would
look
none
the
less
pretty
in
a
picture
because
one
of
the
hearts
was
rather
cold
and
the
other
rather
sad
and
a
charming
picture
cheverel
manor
would
have
made
that
evening
if
some
english
watteau
had
been
there
to
paint
it
the
castellated
house
of
stone
with
the
flickering
sunbeams
sending
dashes
of
golden
light
across
the
panes
in
the
mullioned
windows
and
a
great
beech
leaning
athwart
one
of
the
flanking
towers
and
breaking
with
its
dark
flattened
boughs
the
too
formal
symmetry
of
the
front
the
broad
winding
on
the
right
by
a
row
of
tall
pines
alongside
the
pool
on
the
left
branching
out
among
swelling
grassy
mounds
surmounted
by
clumps
of
trees
where
the
red
trunk
of
the
scotch
fir
glows
in
the
descending
sunlight
against
the
bright
green
of
limes
and
acacias
the
great
pool
where
a
pair
of
swans
are
swimming
lazily
with
one
leg
tucked
under
a
wing
and
where
the
open
lie
calmly
accepting
the
kisses
of
the
fluttering
the
lawn
with
its
smooth
emerald
greenness
sloping
down
to
the
rougher
and
browner
herbage
of
the
park
from
which
it
is
invisibly
fenced
by
a
little
stream
that
winds
away
from
the
pool
and
disappears
under
a
wooden
bridge
in
the
distant
and
on
this
lawn
our
two
ladies
whose
part
in
the
landscape
the
painter
standing
at
a
favourable
point
of
view
in
the
park
would
represent
with
a
few
little
dabs
of
red
and
white
and
blue
seen
from
the
great
gothic
windows
of
the
they
had
much
more
definiteness
of
outline
and
were
distinctly
visible
to
the
three
gentlemen
sipping
their
claret
there
as
two
fair
women
in
whom
all
three
had
a
personal
interest
these
gentlemen
were
a
group
worth
considering
attentively
but
any
one
entering
that
for
the
first
time
would
perhaps
have
had
his
attention
even
more
strongly
arrested
by
the
room
itself
which
was
so
bare
of
furniture
that
it
impressed
one
with
its
architectural
beauty
like
a
cathedral
a
piece
of
matting
stretched
from
door
to
door
a
bit
of
worn
carpet
under
the
and
a
sideboard
in
a
deep
recess
did
not
detain
the
eye
for
a
moment
from
the
lofty
groined
ceiling
with
its
pendants
all
of
creamy
white
relieved
here
and
there
by
touches
of
gold
on
one
side
this
lofty
ceiling
was
supported
by
pillars
and
arches
beyond
which
a
lower
ceiling
a
miniature
copy
of
the
higher
one
covered
the
square
projection
which
with
its
three
large
pointed
windows
formed
the
central
feature
of
the
building
the
room
looked
less
like
a
place
to
dine
in
than
a
piece
of
space
enclosed
simply
for
the
sake
of
beautiful
outline
and
the
small
with
the
party
round
it
seemed
an
odd
and
insignificant
accident
rather
than
anything
connected
with
the
original
purpose
of
the
apartment
but
examined
closely
that
group
was
far
from
insignificant
for
the
eldest
who
was
reading
in
the
newspaper
the
last
portentous
proceedings
of
the
french
parliaments
and
turning
with
occasional
comments
to
his
young
companions
was
as
fine
a
specimen
of
the
old
english
gentleman
as
could
well
have
been
found
in
those
venerable
days
of
and
pigtails
his
dark
eyes
sparkled
under
projecting
brows
made
more
prominent
by
bushy
grizzled
eyebrows
but
any
apprehension
of
severity
excited
by
these
penetrating
eyes
and
by
a
somewhat
aquiline
nose
was
allayed
by
the
lines
about
the
mouth
which
retained
all
its
teeth
and
its
vigour
of
expression
in
spite
of
sixty
winters
the
forehead
sloped
a
little
from
the
projecting
brows
and
its
peaked
outline
was
made
conspicuous
by
the
arrangement
of
the
hair
drawn
backward
and
gathered
into
a
pigtail
he
sat
in
a
small
hard
chair
which
did
not
admit
the
slightest
approach
to
a
lounge
and
which
showed
to
advantage
the
flatness
of
his
back
and
the
breadth
of
his
chest
in
fact
sir
christopher
cheverel
was
a
splendid
old
gentleman
as
any
one
may
see
who
enters
the
saloon
at
cheverel
manor
where
his
portrait
taken
when
he
was
fifty
hangs
side
by
side
with
that
of
his
wife
the
stately
lady
seated
on
the
lawn
looking
at
sir
christopher
you
would
at
once
have
been
inclined
to
hope
that
he
had
a
son
and
heir
but
perhaps
you
would
have
wished
that
it
might
not
prove
to
be
the
young
man
on
his
right
hand
in
whom
a
certain
resemblance
to
the
baronet
in
the
contour
of
the
nose
and
brow
seemed
to
indicate
a
family
relationship
if
this
young
man
had
been
less
elegant
in
his
person
he
would
have
been
remarked
for
the
elegance
of
his
dress
but
the
perfections
of
his
slim
figure
were
so
striking
that
no
one
but
a
tailor
could
notice
the
perfections
of
his
velvet
coat
and
his
small
white
hands
with
their
blue
veins
and
taper
fingers
quite
eclipsed
the
beauty
of
his
lace
ruffles
the
face
however
it
was
difficult
to
say
why
was
certainly
not
pleasing
nothing
could
be
more
delicate
than
the
blond
complexion
its
bloom
set
off
by
the
powdered
hair
than
the
veined
overhanging
which
gave
an
indolent
expression
to
the
hazel
eyes
nothing
more
finely
cut
than
the
transparent
nostril
and
the
short
perhaps
the
chin
and
lower
jaw
were
too
small
for
an
irreproachable
profile
but
the
defect
was
on
the
side
of
that
delicacy
and
which
was
the
distinctive
characteristic
of
the
whole
person
and
which
was
carried
out
in
the
clear
brown
arch
of
the
eyebrows
and
the
marble
smoothness
of
the
sloping
forehead
impossible
to
say
that
this
face
was
not
eminently
handsome
yet
for
the
majority
both
of
men
and
women
it
was
destitute
of
charm
women
disliked
eyes
that
seemed
to
be
indolently
accepting
admiration
instead
of
rendering
it
and
men
especially
if
they
had
a
tendency
to
clumsiness
in
the
nose
and
ankles
were
inclined
to
think
this
antinous
in
a
a
puppy
i
fancy
that
was
frequently
the
inward
interjection
of
the
rev
maynard
gilfil
who
was
seated
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
though
gilfil
legs
and
profile
were
not
at
all
of
a
kind
to
make
him
peculiarly
alive
to
the
impertinence
and
frivolity
of
personal
advantages
his
healthy
open
face
and
robust
limbs
were
after
an
excellent
pattern
for
everyday
wear
and
in
the
opinion
of
bates
the
gardener
would
have
become
regimentals
fain
saight
better
than
the
features
and
slight
form
of
captain
wybrow
notwithstanding
that
this
young
gentleman
as
sir
christopher
nephew
and
destined
heir
had
the
strongest
hereditary
claim
on
the
gardener
respect
and
was
undeniably
but
alas
human
longings
are
perversely
obstinate
and
to
the
man
whose
mouth
is
watering
for
a
peach
it
is
of
no
use
to
offer
the
largest
vegetable
marrow
gilfil
was
not
sensitive
to
opinion
whereas
he
was
sensitive
to
the
opinion
of
another
person
who
by
no
means
shared
bates
preference
who
the
other
person
was
it
would
not
have
required
a
very
keen
observer
to
guess
from
a
certain
eagerness
in
gilfil
glance
as
that
little
figure
in
white
tripped
along
the
lawn
with
the
cushions
captain
wybrow
too
was
looking
in
the
same
direction
but
his
handsome
face
remained
handsome
and
nothing
more
said
sir
christopher
looking
up
from
his
paper
my
lady
ring
for
coffee
anthony
we
go
and
join
her
and
the
little
monkey
tina
shall
give
us
a
song
the
coffee
presently
appeared
brought
not
as
usual
by
the
footman
in
scarlet
and
drab
but
by
the
old
butler
in
threadbare
but
black
who
as
he
was
placing
it
on
the
table
said
you
please
sir
christopher
there
the
widow
hartopp
i
the
still
room
and
begs
leave
to
see
your
honour
have
given
markham
full
orders
about
the
widow
hartopp
said
sir
christopher
in
a
sharp
decided
tone
have
nothing
to
say
to
her
honour
pleaded
the
butler
rubbing
his
hands
and
putting
on
an
additional
coating
of
humility
poor
woman
dreadful
overcome
and
says
she
ca
sleep
a
wink
this
blessed
night
without
seeing
your
honour
and
she
begs
you
to
pardon
the
great
freedom
she
took
to
come
at
this
time
she
cries
fit
to
break
her
heart
ay
water
pays
no
tax
well
show
her
into
the
library
coffee
despatched
the
two
young
men
walked
out
through
the
open
window
and
joined
the
ladies
on
the
lawn
while
sir
christopher
made
his
way
to
the
library
solemnly
followed
by
rupert
his
pet
bloodhound
who
in
his
habitual
place
at
the
baronet
right
hand
behaved
with
great
urbanity
during
dinner
but
when
the
cloth
was
drawn
invariably
disappeared
under
the
table
apparently
regarding
the
as
a
mere
human
weakness
which
he
winked
at
but
refused
to
sanction
the
library
lay
but
three
steps
from
the
on
the
other
side
of
a
cloistered
and
matted
passage
the
oriel
window
was
overshadowed
by
the
great
beech
and
this
with
the
flat
ceiling
and
the
dark
hue
of
the
old
books
that
lined
the
walls
made
the
room
look
sombre
especially
on
entering
it
from
the
with
its
aerial
curves
and
fretwork
touched
with
gold
as
sir
christopher
opened
the
door
a
jet
of
brighter
light
fell
on
a
woman
in
a
dress
who
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
made
the
deepest
of
curtsies
as
he
entered
she
was
a
buxom
woman
approaching
forty
her
eyes
red
with
the
tears
which
had
evidently
been
absorbed
by
the
handkerchief
gathered
into
a
damp
ball
in
her
right
hand
hartopp
said
sir
christopher
taking
out
his
gold
and
tapping
the
lid
have
you
to
say
to
me
markham
has
delivered
you
a
notice
to
quit
i
suppose
yis
your
honour
an
that
the
reason
why
i
come
i
hope
your
honour
think
better
on
it
an
not
turn
me
an
my
poor
children
out
o
the
farm
where
my
husband
paid
his
rent
as
reglar
as
the
day
come
i
should
like
to
know
what
good
it
will
do
you
and
your
children
to
stay
on
a
farm
and
lose
every
farthing
your
husband
has
left
you
instead
of
selling
your
stock
and
going
into
some
little
place
where
you
can
keep
your
money
together
it
is
very
well
known
to
every
tenant
of
mine
that
i
never
allow
widows
to
stay
on
their
husbands
farms
sir
christifer
if
you
consider
when
i
sold
the
hay
corn
an
all
the
live
things
an
paid
the
debts
an
put
the
money
out
to
use
i
shall
have
hardly
enough
to
keep
our
souls
an
bodies
together
an
how
can
i
rear
my
boys
and
put
they
must
go
for
an
their
father
a
man
wi
as
good
belongings
as
any
on
your
honour
estate
an
niver
threshed
his
wheat
afore
it
was
well
the
rick
nor
sold
the
straw
off
his
farm
nor
nothin
ask
all
the
farmers
round
if
there
was
a
stiddier
soberer
man
than
my
husband
as
attended
ripstone
market
an
he
says
bessie
says
he
them
was
his
last
words
you
mek
a
shift
to
manage
the
farm
if
sir
christifer
let
you
stay
on
pooh
said
sir
christopher
hartopp
sobs
having
interrupted
her
pleadings
listen
to
me
and
try
to
understand
a
little
common
sense
you
are
about
as
able
to
manage
the
farm
as
your
best
milch
cow
you
be
obliged
to
have
some
managing
man
who
will
either
cheat
you
out
of
your
money
or
wheedle
you
into
marrying
him
your
honour
i
was
never
that
sort
o
woman
an
nobody
has
known
it
on
me
likely
not
because
you
were
never
a
widow
before
a
woman
always
silly
enough
but
she
never
quite
as
great
a
fool
as
she
can
be
until
she
puts
on
a
widow
cap
now
just
ask
yourself
how
much
the
better
you
will
be
for
staying
on
your
farm
at
the
end
of
four
years
when
got
through
your
money
and
let
your
farm
run
down
and
are
in
arrears
for
half
your
rent
or
perhaps
have
got
some
great
hulky
fellow
for
a
husband
who
swears
at
you
and
kicks
your
children
sir
christifer
i
know
a
deal
o
farmin
an
was
brought
up
the
thick
on
it
as
you
may
say
an
there
was
my
husband
managed
a
farm
for
twenty
year
an
left
legacies
to
all
her
nephys
nieces
an
even
to
my
husband
as
was
then
a
babe
unborn
a
woman
six
feet
high
with
a
squint
and
sharp
elbows
i
daresay
a
man
in
petticoats
not
a
widow
like
you
mrs
hartopp
your
honour
i
never
heard
of
her
squintin
an
they
said
as
she
might
ha
been
married
and
again
to
people
as
had
no
call
to
hanker
after
her
money
ay
that
what
you
all
think
every
man
that
looks
at
you
wants
to
marry
you
and
would
like
you
the
better
the
more
children
you
have
and
the
less
money
but
it
is
useless
to
talk
and
cry
i
have
good
reasons
for
my
plans
and
never
alter
them
what
you
have
to
do
is
to
take
the
best
of
your
stock
and
to
look
out
for
some
little
place
to
go
to
when
you
leave
the
hollows
now
go
back
to
bellamy
room
and
ask
her
to
give
you
a
dish
of
tea
hartopp
understanding
from
sir
christopher
tone
that
he
was
not
to
be
shaken
curtsied
low
and
left
the
library
while
the
baronet
seating
himself
at
his
desk
in
the
oriel
window
wrote
the
following
letter
markham
take
no
steps
about
letting
crowsfoot
cottage
as
i
intend
to
put
in
the
widow
hartopp
when
she
leaves
her
farm
and
if
you
will
be
here
at
eleven
on
saturday
morning
i
will
ride
round
with
you
and
settle
about
making
some
repairs
and
see
about
adding
a
bit
of
land
to
the
take
as
she
will
want
to
keep
a
cow
and
some
yours
faithfully
christopher
cheverel
after
ringing
the
bell
and
ordering
this
letter
to
be
sent
sir
christopher
walked
out
to
join
the
party
on
the
lawn
but
finding
the
cushions
deserted
he
walked
on
to
the
eastern
front
of
the
building
where
by
the
side
of
the
grand
entrance
was
the
large
of
the
saloon
opening
on
to
the
and
looking
towards
a
long
vista
of
undulating
turf
bordered
by
tall
trees
which
seeming
to
unite
itself
with
the
green
of
the
meadows
and
a
grassy
road
through
a
plantation
only
terminated
with
the
gothic
arch
of
a
gateway
in
the
far
distance
the
was
open
and
sir
christopher
stepping
in
found
the
group
he
sought
examining
the
progress
of
the
unfinished
ceiling
it
was
in
the
same
style
of
florid
pointed
gothic
as
the
but
more
elaborate
in
its
tracery
which
was
like
petrified
picked
out
with
delicate
and
varied
colouring
about
a
fourth
of
its
still
remained
uncoloured
and
under
this
part
were
scaffolding
ladders
and
tools
otherwise
the
spacious
saloon
was
empty
of
furniture
and
seemed
to
be
a
grand
gothic
canopy
for
the
group
of
five
human
figures
standing
in
the
centre
has
been
getting
on
a
little
better
the
last
day
or
two
said
sir
christopher
as
he
joined
the
party
a
sad
lazy
dog
and
i
fancy
he
has
a
knack
of
sleeping
as
he
stands
with
his
brushes
in
his
hands
but
i
must
spur
him
on
or
we
may
not
have
the
scaffolding
cleared
away
before
the
bride
comes
if
you
show
dexterous
generalship
in
your
wooing
eh
anthony
and
take
your
magdeburg
quickly
sir
a
siege
is
known
to
be
one
of
the
most
tedious
operations
in
war
said
captain
wybrow
with
an
easy
smile
when
there
a
traitor
within
the
walls
in
the
shape
of
a
soft
heart
and
that
there
will
be
if
beatrice
has
her
mother
tenderness
as
well
as
her
mother
beauty
do
you
think
sir
christopher
said
lady
cheverel
who
seemed
to
wince
a
little
under
her
husband
reminiscences
hanging
sibyl
over
that
door
when
we
put
up
the
pictures
it
is
rather
lost
in
my
good
my
love
answered
sir
christopher
in
a
tone
of
punctiliously
polite
affection
you
like
to
part
with
the
ornament
from
your
own
room
it
will
show
admirably
here
our
portraits
by
sir
joshua
will
hang
opposite
the
window
and
the
transfiguration
at
that
end
you
see
anthony
i
am
leaving
no
good
places
on
the
walls
for
you
and
your
wife
we
shall
turn
you
with
your
faces
to
the
wall
in
the
gallery
and
you
may
take
your
revenge
on
us
while
this
conversation
was
going
on
gilfil
turned
to
caterina
and
said
like
the
view
from
this
window
better
than
any
other
in
the
house
she
made
no
answer
and
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
filling
with
tears
so
he
added
we
walk
out
a
little
sir
christopher
and
my
lady
seem
to
be
occupied
caterina
complied
silently
and
they
turned
down
one
of
the
gravel
walks
that
led
after
many
windings
under
tall
trees
and
among
grassy
openings
to
a
large
enclosed
their
walk
was
perfectly
silent
for
maynard
gilfil
knew
that
caterina
thoughts
were
not
with
him
and
she
had
been
long
used
to
make
him
endure
the
weight
of
those
moods
which
she
carefully
hid
from
others
they
reached
the
and
turned
mechanically
in
at
the
gate
that
opened
through
a
high
thick
hedge
on
an
expanse
of
brilliant
colour
which
after
the
green
shades
they
had
passed
through
startled
the
eye
like
flames
the
effect
was
assisted
by
an
undulation
of
the
ground
which
gradually
descended
from
the
and
then
rose
again
towards
the
opposite
end
crowned
by
an
orangery
the
flowers
were
glowing
with
their
evening
splendours
verbenas
and
heliotropes
were
sending
up
their
finest
incense
it
seemed
a
gala
where
all
was
happiness
and
brilliancy
and
misery
could
find
no
sympathy
this
was
the
effect
it
had
on
caterina
as
she
wound
among
the
beds
of
gold
and
blue
and
pink
where
the
flowers
seemed
to
be
looking
at
her
with
wondering
eyes
knowing
nothing
of
sorrow
the
feeling
of
isolation
in
her
wretchedness
overcame
her
and
the
tears
which
had
been
before
trickling
slowly
down
her
pale
cheeks
now
gushed
forth
accompanied
with
sobs
and
yet
there
was
a
loving
human
being
close
beside
her
whose
heart
was
aching
for
hers
who
was
possessed
by
the
feeling
that
she
was
miserable
and
that
he
was
helpless
to
soothe
her
but
she
was
too
much
irritated
by
the
idea
that
his
wishes
were
different
from
hers
that
he
rather
regretted
the
folly
of
her
hopes
than
the
probability
of
their
disappointment
to
take
any
comfort
in
his
sympathy
caterina
like
the
rest
of
us
turned
away
from
sympathy
which
she
suspected
to
be
mingled
with
criticism
as
the
child
turns
away
from
the
sweetmeat
in
which
it
suspects
imperceptible
medicine
caterina
i
think
i
hear
voices
said
gilfil
may
be
coming
this
way
she
checked
herself
like
one
accustomed
to
conceal
her
emotions
and
ran
rapidly
to
the
other
end
of
the
garden
where
she
seemed
occupied
in
selecting
a
rose
presently
lady
cheverel
entered
leaning
on
the
arm
of
captain
wybrow
and
followed
by
sir
christopher
the
party
stopped
to
admire
the
tiers
of
geraniums
near
the
gate
and
in
the
mean
time
caterina
tripped
back
with
a
moss
in
her
hand
and
going
up
to
sir
christopher
said
padroncello
there
is
a
nice
rose
for
your
you
monkey
he
said
fondly
stroking
her
cheek
you
have
been
running
off
with
maynard
either
to
torment
or
coax
him
an
inch
or
two
deeper
into
love
come
come
i
want
you
to
sing
us
before
we
sit
down
to
picquet
anthony
goes
tomorrow
you
know
you
must
warble
him
into
the
right
sentimental
lover
mood
that
he
may
acquit
himself
well
at
bath
he
put
her
little
arm
under
his
and
calling
to
lady
cheverel
henrietta
led
the
way
towards
the
house
the
party
entered
the
which
with
its
oriel
window
corresponded
to
the
library
in
the
other
wing
and
had
also
a
flat
ceiling
heavy
with
carving
and
blazonry
but
the
window
being
unshaded
and
the
walls
hung
with
portraits
of
knights
and
dames
in
scarlet
white
and
gold
it
had
not
the
sombre
effect
of
the
library
here
hung
the
portrait
of
sir
anthony
cheverel
who
in
the
reign
of
charles
ii
was
the
renovator
of
the
family
splendour
which
had
suffered
some
declension
from
the
early
brilliancy
of
that
chevreuil
who
came
over
with
the
conqueror
a
very
imposing
personage
was
this
sir
anthony
standing
with
one
arm
akimbo
and
one
fine
leg
and
foot
advanced
evidently
with
a
view
to
the
gratification
of
his
contemporaries
and
posterity
you
might
have
taken
off
his
splendid
peruke
and
his
scarlet
cloak
which
was
thrown
backward
from
his
shoulders
without
annihilating
the
dignity
of
his
appearance
and
he
had
known
how
to
choose
a
wife
too
for
his
lady
hanging
opposite
to
him
with
her
sunny
brown
hair
drawn
away
in
bands
from
her
mild
grave
face
and
falling
in
two
large
rich
curls
on
her
snowy
neck
which
shamed
the
harsher
hue
and
outline
of
her
white
satin
robe
was
a
fit
mother
of
heirs
in
this
room
tea
was
served
and
here
every
evening
as
regularly
as
the
great
clock
in
the
with
deliberate
bass
tones
struck
nine
sir
christopher
and
lady
cheverel
sat
down
to
picquet
until
ten
when
gilfil
read
prayers
to
the
assembled
household
in
the
chapel
but
now
it
was
not
near
nine
and
caterina
must
sit
down
to
the
harpsichord
and
sing
sir
christopher
favourite
airs
from
an
opera
which
for
the
happiness
of
that
generation
was
then
to
be
heard
on
the
london
stage
it
happened
this
evening
that
the
sentiment
of
these
airs
faro
senza
eurydice
and
perduto
il
bel
in
both
of
which
the
singer
pours
out
his
yearning
after
his
lost
love
came
very
close
to
caterina
own
feeling
but
her
emotion
instead
of
being
a
hindrance
to
her
singing
gave
her
additional
power
her
singing
was
what
she
could
do
best
it
was
her
one
point
of
superiority
in
which
it
was
probable
she
would
excel
the
highborn
beauty
whom
anthony
was
to
woo
and
her
love
her
jealousy
her
pride
her
rebellion
against
her
destiny
made
one
stream
of
passion
which
welled
forth
in
the
deep
rich
tones
of
her
voice
she
had
a
rare
contralto
which
lady
cheverel
who
had
high
musical
taste
had
been
careful
to
preserve
her
from
straining
caterina
said
lady
cheverel
as
there
was
a
pause
after
the
wonderful
linked
sweetness
of
never
heard
you
sing
that
so
well
once
more
it
was
repeated
and
then
came
perduto
which
sir
christopher
encored
in
spite
of
the
clock
just
striking
nine
when
the
last
note
was
dying
out
he
said
a
clever
monkey
now
bring
out
the
table
for
picquet
caterina
drew
out
the
table
and
placed
the
cards
then
with
her
rapid
fairy
suddenness
of
motion
threw
herself
on
her
knees
and
clasped
sir
christopher
knee
he
bent
down
stroked
her
cheek
and
smiled
that
is
foolish
said
lady
cheverel
wish
you
would
leave
off
those
antics
she
jumped
up
arranged
the
music
on
the
harpsichord
and
then
seeing
the
baronet
and
his
lady
seated
at
picquet
quietly
glided
out
of
the
room
captain
wybrow
had
been
leaning
near
the
harpsichord
during
the
singing
and
the
chaplain
had
thrown
himself
on
a
sofa
at
the
end
of
the
room
they
both
now
took
up
a
book
gilfil
chose
the
last
number
of
the
magazine
captain
wybrow
stretched
on
an
ottoman
near
the
door
opened
and
there
was
perfect
silence
in
the
room
which
ten
minutes
before
was
vibrating
to
the
passionate
tones
of
caterina
she
had
made
her
way
along
the
cloistered
passages
now
lighted
here
and
there
by
a
small
to
the
which
led
directly
to
a
gallery
running
along
the
whole
eastern
side
of
the
building
where
it
was
her
habit
to
walk
when
she
wished
to
be
alone
the
bright
moonlight
was
streaming
through
the
windows
throwing
into
strange
light
and
shadow
the
heterogeneous
objects
that
lined
the
long
walls
greek
statues
and
busts
of
roman
emperors
low
cabinets
filled
with
curiosities
natural
and
antiquarian
tropical
birds
and
huge
horns
of
beasts
hindoo
gods
and
strange
shells
swords
and
daggers
and
bits
of
roman
lamps
and
tiny
models
of
greek
temples
and
above
all
these
queer
old
family
portraits
of
little
boys
and
girls
once
the
hope
of
the
cheverels
with
heads
imprisoned
in
stiff
ruffs
of
faded
ladies
with
rudimentary
features
and
of
gallant
gentlemen
with
high
hips
high
shoulders
and
red
pointed
beards
here
on
rainy
days
sir
christopher
and
his
lady
took
their
promenade
and
here
billiards
were
played
but
in
the
evening
it
was
forsaken
by
all
except
caterina
and
sometimes
one
other
person
she
paced
up
and
down
in
the
moonlight
her
pale
face
and
thin
form
making
her
look
like
the
ghost
of
some
former
lady
cheverel
come
to
revisit
the
glimpses
of
the
moon
she
paused
opposite
the
broad
window
above
the
portico
and
looked
out
on
the
long
vista
of
turf
and
trees
now
stretching
chill
and
saddened
in
the
moonlight
suddenly
a
breath
of
warmth
and
roses
seemed
to
float
towards
her
and
an
arm
stole
gently
round
her
waist
while
a
soft
hand
took
up
her
tiny
fingers
caterina
felt
an
electric
thrill
and
was
motionless
for
one
long
moment
then
she
pushed
away
the
arm
and
hand
and
turning
round
lifted
up
to
the
face
that
hung
over
her
eyes
full
of
tenderness
and
reproach
the
unconsciousness
was
gone
and
in
that
one
look
were
the
ground
tones
of
poor
little
caterina
nature
intense
love
and
fierce
jealousy
do
you
push
me
away
tina
said
captain
wybrow
in
a
you
angry
with
me
for
what
a
hard
fate
puts
upon
me
would
you
have
me
cross
my
uncle
who
has
done
so
much
for
us
both
in
his
dearest
wish
you
know
i
have
duties
we
both
have
duties
before
which
feeling
must
be
sacrificed
yes
said
caterina
stamping
her
foot
and
turning
away
her
head
tell
me
what
i
know
already
there
was
a
voice
speaking
in
caterina
mind
to
which
she
had
never
yet
given
vent
that
voice
said
continually
did
he
make
me
love
him
why
did
he
let
me
know
he
loved
me
if
he
knew
all
the
while
that
he
could
brave
everything
for
my
sake
then
love
answered
was
led
on
by
the
feeling
of
the
moment
as
you
have
been
caterina
and
now
you
ought
to
help
him
to
do
what
is
right
then
the
voice
rejoined
was
a
slight
matter
to
him
he
does
much
mind
giving
you
up
he
will
soon
love
that
beautiful
woman
and
forget
a
poor
little
pale
thing
like
you
thus
love
anger
and
jealousy
were
struggling
in
that
young
soul
tina
continued
captain
wybrow
in
still
gentler
tones
shall
not
succeed
miss
assher
very
likely
prefers
some
one
else
and
you
know
i
have
the
best
will
in
the
world
to
fail
i
shall
come
back
a
hapless
bachelor
perhaps
to
find
you
already
married
to
the
chaplain
who
is
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
you
poor
sir
christopher
has
made
up
his
mind
that
you
to
have
gilfil
will
you
speak
so
you
speak
from
your
own
want
of
feeling
go
away
from
me
let
us
part
in
anger
tina
all
this
may
pass
away
it
as
likely
as
not
that
i
may
never
marry
any
one
at
all
these
palpitations
may
carry
me
off
and
you
may
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
i
shall
never
be
anybody
who
knows
what
may
happen
i
may
be
my
own
master
before
i
get
into
the
bonds
of
holy
matrimony
and
be
able
to
choose
my
little
why
should
we
distress
ourselves
before
the
time
is
easy
to
talk
so
when
you
are
not
feeling
said
caterina
the
tears
flowing
fast
is
bad
to
bear
now
whatever
may
come
after
but
you
do
care
about
my
misery
i
tina
said
anthony
in
his
tenderest
tones
again
stealing
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
drawing
her
towards
him
poor
tina
was
the
slave
of
this
voice
and
touch
grief
and
resentment
retrospect
and
foreboding
vanished
all
life
before
and
after
melted
away
in
the
bliss
of
that
moment
as
anthony
pressed
his
lips
to
hers
captain
wybrow
thought
little
tina
it
would
make
her
very
happy
to
have
me
but
she
is
a
mad
little
thing
at
that
moment
a
loud
bell
startled
caterina
from
her
trance
of
bliss
it
was
the
summons
to
prayers
in
the
chapel
and
she
hastened
away
leaving
captain
wybrow
to
follow
slowly
it
was
a
pretty
sight
that
family
assembled
to
worship
in
the
little
chapel
where
a
couple
of
threw
a
mild
faint
light
on
the
figures
kneeling
there
in
the
desk
was
gilfil
with
his
face
a
shade
graver
than
usual
on
his
right
hand
kneeling
on
their
red
velvet
cushions
were
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
household
in
their
elderly
dignified
beauty
on
his
left
the
youthful
grace
of
anthony
and
caterina
in
all
the
striking
contrast
of
their
colouring
he
with
his
exquisite
outline
and
rounded
fairness
like
an
olympian
god
she
dark
and
tiny
like
a
gypsy
changeling
then
there
were
the
domestics
kneeling
on
forms
the
women
headed
by
bellamy
the
natty
little
old
housekeeper
in
snowy
cap
and
apron
and
sharp
my
lady
maid
of
somewhat
vinegar
aspect
and
flaunting
attire
the
men
by
bellamy
the
butler
and
warren
sir
christopher
venerable
valet
a
few
collects
from
the
evening
service
was
what
gilfil
habitually
read
ending
with
the
simple
petition
our
darkness
and
then
they
all
rose
the
servants
turning
to
curtsy
and
bow
as
they
went
out
the
family
returned
to
the
said
to
each
other
and
dispersed
all
to
speedy
slumber
except
two
caterina
only
cried
herself
to
sleep
after
the
clock
had
struck
twelve
gilfil
lay
awake
still
longer
thinking
that
very
likely
caterina
was
crying
captain
wybrow
having
dismissed
his
valet
at
eleven
was
soon
in
a
soft
slumber
his
face
looking
like
a
fine
cameo
in
high
relief
on
the
slightly
indented
pillow
chapter
the
last
chapter
has
given
the
discerning
reader
sufficient
insight
into
the
state
of
things
at
cheverel
manor
in
the
summer
of
in
that
summer
we
know
the
great
nation
of
france
was
agitated
by
conflicting
thoughts
and
passions
which
were
but
the
beginning
of
sorrows
and
in
our
caterina
little
breast
too
there
were
terrible
struggles
the
poor
bird
was
beginning
to
flutter
and
vainly
dash
its
soft
breast
against
the
hard
iron
bars
of
the
inevitable
and
we
see
too
plainly
the
danger
if
that
anguish
should
go
on
heightening
instead
of
being
allayed
that
the
palpitating
heart
may
be
fatally
bruised
meanwhile
if
as
i
hope
you
feel
some
interest
in
caterina
and
her
friends
at
cheverel
manor
you
are
perhaps
asking
how
came
she
to
be
there
how
was
it
that
this
tiny
child
of
the
south
whose
face
was
immediately
suggestive
of
hills
and
shrines
came
to
have
her
home
in
that
stately
english
by
the
side
of
the
blonde
matron
lady
cheverel
almost
as
if
a
were
found
perched
on
one
of
the
in
the
park
by
the
side
of
her
ladyship
handsomest
speaking
good
english
too
and
joining
in
protestant
prayers
surely
she
must
have
been
adopted
and
brought
over
to
england
at
a
very
early
age
she
was
during
sir
christopher
last
visit
to
italy
with
his
lady
fifteen
years
before
they
resided
for
some
time
at
milan
where
sir
christopher
who
was
an
enthusiast
for
gothic
architecture
and
was
then
entertaining
the
project
of
metamorphosing
his
plain
brick
family
mansion
into
the
model
of
a
gothic
was
bent
on
studying
the
details
of
that
marble
miracle
the
cathedral
here
lady
cheverel
as
at
other
italian
cities
where
she
made
any
protracted
stay
engaged
a
to
give
her
lessons
in
singing
for
she
had
then
not
only
fine
musical
taste
but
a
fine
soprano
voice
those
were
days
when
very
rich
people
used
manuscript
music
and
many
a
man
who
resembled
jean
jacques
in
nothing
else
resembled
him
in
getting
a
livelihood
copier
la
musique
a
tant
la
page
lady
cheverel
having
need
of
this
service
maestro
albani
told
her
he
would
send
her
a
poveraccio
of
his
acquaintance
whose
manuscript
was
the
neatest
and
most
correct
he
knew
of
unhappily
the
poveraccio
was
not
always
in
his
best
wits
and
was
sometimes
rather
slow
in
consequence
but
it
would
be
a
work
of
christian
charity
worthy
of
the
beautiful
signora
to
employ
poor
sarti
the
next
morning
sharp
then
a
blooming
abigail
of
entered
her
lady
private
room
and
said
you
please
my
lady
there
the
frowsiest
shabbiest
man
you
ever
saw
outside
and
he
told
warren
as
the
sent
him
to
see
your
ladyship
but
i
think
you
hardly
like
him
to
come
in
here
belike
he
only
a
beggar
yes
show
him
in
immediately
sharp
retired
muttering
something
about
and
worse
she
had
the
smallest
possible
admiration
for
fair
ausonia
and
its
natives
and
even
her
profound
deference
for
sir
christopher
and
her
lady
could
not
prevent
her
from
expressing
her
amazement
at
the
infatuation
of
gentlefolks
in
choosing
to
sojourn
among
in
countries
where
there
was
no
getting
to
air
a
bit
o
linen
and
where
the
people
smelt
garlick
fit
to
knock
you
down
however
she
presently
reappeared
ushering
in
a
small
meagre
man
sallow
and
dingy
with
a
restless
wandering
look
in
his
dull
eyes
and
an
excessive
timidity
about
his
deep
reverences
which
gave
him
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
been
long
a
solitary
prisoner
yet
through
all
this
squalor
and
wretchedness
there
were
some
traces
discernible
of
comparative
youth
and
former
good
looks
lady
cheverel
though
not
very
still
less
sentimental
was
essentially
kind
and
liked
to
dispense
benefits
like
a
goddess
who
looks
down
benignly
on
the
halt
the
maimed
and
the
blind
that
approach
her
shrine
she
was
smitten
with
some
compassion
at
the
sight
of
poor
sarti
who
struck
her
as
the
mere
battered
wreck
of
a
vessel
that
might
have
once
floated
gaily
enough
on
its
outward
voyage
to
the
sound
of
pipes
and
tabors
she
spoke
gently
as
she
pointed
out
to
him
the
operatic
selections
she
wished
him
to
copy
and
he
seemed
to
sun
himself
in
her
auburn
radiant
presence
so
that
when
he
made
his
exit
with
the
under
his
arm
his
bow
though
not
less
reverent
was
less
timid
it
was
ten
years
at
least
since
sarti
had
seen
anything
so
bright
and
stately
and
beautiful
as
lady
cheverel
for
the
time
was
far
off
in
which
he
had
trod
the
stage
in
satin
and
feathers
the
of
one
short
season
he
had
completely
lost
his
voice
in
the
following
winter
and
had
ever
since
been
little
better
than
a
cracked
fiddle
which
is
good
for
nothing
but
firewood
for
like
many
italian
singers
he
was
too
ignorant
to
teach
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
one
talent
of
penmanship
he
and
his
young
helpless
wife
might
have
starved
then
just
after
their
third
child
was
born
fever
came
swept
away
the
sickly
mother
and
the
two
eldest
children
and
attacked
sarti
himself
who
rose
from
his
with
enfeebled
brain
and
muscle
and
a
tiny
baby
on
his
hands
scarcely
four
months
old
he
lodged
over
a
kept
by
a
stout
virago
loud
of
tongue
and
irate
in
temper
but
who
had
had
children
born
to
her
and
so
had
taken
care
of
the
tiny
yellow
and
tended
sarti
himself
through
his
sickness
here
he
continued
to
live
earning
a
meagre
subsistence
for
himself
and
his
little
one
by
the
work
of
copying
music
put
into
his
hands
chiefly
by
maestro
albani
he
seemed
to
exist
for
nothing
but
the
child
he
tended
it
he
dandled
it
he
chatted
to
it
living
with
it
alone
in
his
one
room
above
the
only
asking
his
landlady
to
take
care
of
the
marmoset
during
his
short
absences
in
fetching
and
carrying
home
work
customers
frequenting
that
might
often
see
the
tiny
caterina
seated
on
the
floor
with
her
legs
in
a
heap
of
pease
which
it
was
her
delight
to
kick
about
or
perhaps
deposited
like
a
kitten
in
a
large
basket
out
of
harm
way
sometimes
however
sarti
left
his
little
one
with
another
kind
of
protectress
he
was
very
regular
in
his
devotions
which
he
paid
thrice
in
the
great
cathedral
carrying
caterina
with
him
here
when
the
high
morning
sun
was
warming
the
myriad
glittering
pinnacles
without
and
struggling
against
the
massive
gloom
within
the
shadow
of
a
man
with
a
child
on
his
arm
might
be
seen
flitting
across
the
more
stationary
shadows
of
pillar
and
mullion
and
making
its
way
towards
a
little
tinsel
madonna
hanging
in
a
retired
spot
near
the
choir
amid
all
the
sublimities
of
the
mighty
cathedral
poor
sarti
had
fixed
on
this
tinsel
madonna
as
the
symbol
of
divine
mercy
and
protection
just
as
a
child
in
the
presence
of
a
great
landscape
sees
none
of
the
glories
of
wood
and
sky
but
sets
its
heart
on
a
floating
feather
or
insect
that
happens
to
be
on
a
level
with
its
eye
here
then
sarti
worshipped
and
prayed
setting
caterina
on
the
floor
by
his
side
and
now
and
then
when
the
cathedral
lay
near
some
place
where
he
had
to
call
and
did
not
like
to
take
her
he
would
leave
her
there
in
front
of
the
tinsel
madonna
where
she
would
sit
perfectly
good
amusing
herself
with
low
crowing
noises
and
of
her
tiny
body
and
when
sarti
came
back
he
always
found
that
the
blessed
mother
had
taken
good
care
of
caterina
that
was
briefly
the
history
of
sarti
who
fulfilled
so
well
the
orders
lady
cheverel
gave
him
that
she
sent
him
away
again
with
a
stock
of
new
work
but
this
time
week
after
week
passed
and
he
neither
reappeared
nor
sent
home
the
music
intrusted
to
him
lady
cheverel
began
to
be
anxious
and
was
thinking
of
sending
warren
to
inquire
at
the
address
sarti
had
given
her
when
one
day
as
she
was
equipped
for
driving
out
the
valet
brought
in
a
small
piece
of
paper
which
he
said
had
been
left
for
her
ladyship
by
a
man
who
was
carrying
fruit
the
paper
contained
only
three
tremulous
lines
in
italian
the
eccelentissima
for
the
love
of
god
have
pity
on
a
dying
man
and
come
to
him
lady
cheverel
recognized
the
handwriting
as
sarti
in
spite
of
its
tremulousness
and
going
down
to
her
carriage
ordered
the
milanese
coachman
to
drive
to
strada
quinquagesima
numero
the
coach
stopped
in
a
dirty
narrow
street
opposite
la
pazzini
and
that
large
specimen
of
womanhood
immediately
presented
herself
at
the
door
to
the
extreme
disgust
of
sharp
who
remarked
privately
to
warren
that
la
pazzini
was
a
porpis
the
however
was
all
smiles
and
deep
curtsies
to
the
eccelentissima
who
not
very
well
understanding
her
milanese
dialect
abbreviated
the
conversation
by
asking
to
be
shown
at
once
to
signor
sarti
la
pazzini
preceded
her
up
the
dark
narrow
stairs
and
opened
a
door
through
which
she
begged
her
ladyship
to
enter
directly
opposite
the
door
lay
sarti
on
a
low
miserable
bed
his
eyes
were
glazed
and
no
movement
indicated
that
he
was
conscious
of
their
entrance
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
was
seated
a
tiny
child
apparently
not
three
years
old
her
head
covered
by
a
linen
cap
her
feet
clothed
with
leather
boots
above
which
her
little
yellow
legs
showed
thin
and
naked
a
frock
made
of
what
had
once
been
a
gay
flowered
silk
was
her
only
other
garment
her
large
dark
eyes
shone
from
out
her
queer
little
face
like
two
precious
stones
in
a
grotesque
image
carved
in
old
ivory
she
held
an
empty
in
her
hand
and
was
amusing
herself
with
putting
the
cork
in
and
drawing
it
out
again
to
hear
how
it
would
pop
la
pazzini
went
up
to
the
bed
and
said
la
nobilissima
donna
but
directly
after
screamed
out
mother
he
is
dead
it
was
so
the
entreaty
had
not
been
sent
in
time
for
sarti
to
carry
out
his
project
of
asking
the
great
english
lady
to
take
care
of
his
caterina
that
was
the
thought
which
haunted
his
feeble
brain
as
soon
as
he
began
to
fear
that
his
illness
would
end
in
death
she
had
wealth
she
was
kind
she
would
surely
do
something
for
the
poor
orphan
and
so
at
last
he
sent
that
scrap
of
paper
which
won
the
fulfilment
of
his
prayer
though
he
did
not
live
to
utter
it
lady
cheverel
gave
la
pazzini
money
that
the
last
decencies
might
be
paid
to
the
dead
man
and
carried
away
caterina
meaning
to
consult
sir
christopher
as
to
what
should
be
done
with
her
even
sharp
had
been
so
smitten
with
pity
by
the
scene
she
had
witnessed
when
she
was
summoned
to
fetch
caterina
as
to
shed
a
small
tear
though
she
was
not
at
all
subject
to
that
weakness
indeed
she
abstained
from
it
on
principle
because
as
she
often
said
it
was
known
to
be
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
for
the
eyes
on
the
way
back
to
her
hotel
lady
cheverel
turned
over
various
projects
in
her
mind
regarding
caterina
but
at
last
one
gained
the
preference
over
all
the
rest
why
should
they
not
take
the
child
to
england
and
bring
her
up
there
they
had
been
married
twelve
years
yet
cheverel
manor
was
cheered
by
no
children
voices
and
the
old
house
would
be
all
the
better
for
a
little
of
that
music
besides
it
would
be
a
christian
work
to
train
this
little
papist
into
a
good
protestant
and
graft
as
much
english
fruit
as
possible
on
the
italian
stem
sir
christopher
listened
to
this
plan
with
hearty
acquiescence
he
loved
children
and
took
at
once
to
the
little
monkey
his
name
for
caterina
all
through
her
short
life
but
neither
he
nor
lady
cheverel
had
any
idea
of
adopting
her
as
their
daughter
and
giving
her
their
own
rank
in
life
they
were
much
too
english
and
aristocratic
to
think
of
anything
so
romantic
no
the
child
would
be
brought
up
at
cheverel
manor
as
a
protegee
to
be
ultimately
useful
perhaps
in
sorting
worsteds
keeping
accounts
reading
aloud
and
otherwise
supplying
the
place
of
spectacles
when
her
ladyship
eyes
should
wax
dim
so
sharp
had
to
procure
new
clothes
to
replace
the
linen
cap
flowered
frock
and
leathern
boots
and
now
strange
to
say
little
caterina
who
had
suffered
many
unconscious
evils
in
her
existence
of
thirty
moons
first
began
to
know
conscious
troubles
says
ajax
a
painless
evil
so
i
should
think
is
dirt
considering
the
merry
faces
that
go
along
with
it
at
any
rate
cleanliness
is
sometimes
a
painful
good
as
any
one
can
vouch
who
has
had
his
face
washed
the
wrong
way
by
a
pitiless
hand
with
a
gold
ring
on
the
third
finger
if
you
reader
have
not
known
that
initiatory
anguish
it
is
idle
to
expect
that
you
will
form
any
approximate
conception
of
what
caterina
endured
under
sharp
new
dispensation
of
happily
this
purgatory
came
presently
to
be
associated
in
her
tiny
brain
with
a
passage
straightway
to
a
seat
of
bliss
the
sofa
in
lady
where
there
were
toys
to
be
broken
a
ride
was
to
be
had
on
sir
christopher
knee
and
a
spaniel
of
resigned
temper
was
prepared
to
undergo
small
tortures
without
flinching
chapter
in
three
months
from
the
time
of
caterina
adoption
namely
in
the
late
autumn
of
the
chimneys
of
cheverel
manor
were
sending
up
unwonted
smoke
and
the
servants
were
awaiting
in
excitement
the
return
of
their
master
and
mistress
after
a
two
years
absence
great
was
the
astonishment
of
bellamy
the
housekeeper
when
warren
lifted
a
little
child
out
of
the
carriage
and
great
was
sense
of
superior
information
and
experience
as
she
detailed
history
interspersed
with
copious
comments
to
the
rest
of
the
upper
servants
that
evening
as
they
were
taking
a
comfortable
glass
of
grog
together
in
the
housekeeper
room
a
pleasant
room
it
was
as
any
party
need
desire
to
muster
in
on
a
cold
november
evening
the
fireplace
alone
was
a
picture
a
wide
and
deep
recess
with
a
low
brick
altar
in
the
middle
where
great
logs
of
dry
wood
sent
myriad
sparks
up
the
dark
and
over
the
front
of
this
recess
a
large
wooden
entablature
bearing
this
motto
finely
carved
in
old
english
letters
god
and
honour
the
king
and
beyond
the
party
who
formed
a
with
their
chairs
and
table
round
this
bright
fireplace
what
a
space
of
chiaroscuro
for
the
imagination
to
revel
in
stretching
across
the
far
end
of
the
room
what
an
oak
table
high
enough
surely
for
homer
gods
standing
on
four
massive
legs
bossed
and
bulging
like
sculptured
urns
and
lining
the
distant
wall
what
vast
cupboards
suggestive
of
inexhaustible
apricot
jam
and
promiscuous
butler
perquisites
a
stray
picture
or
two
had
found
their
way
down
there
and
made
agreeable
patches
of
dark
brown
on
the
walls
high
over
the
double
door
hung
one
which
from
some
indications
of
a
face
looming
out
of
blackness
might
by
a
great
synthetic
effort
be
pronounced
a
magdalen
considerably
lower
down
hung
the
similitude
of
a
hat
and
feathers
with
portions
of
a
ruff
stated
by
bellamy
to
represent
sir
francis
bacon
who
invented
gunpowder
and
in
her
opinion
ha
been
better
emplyed
but
this
evening
the
mind
is
but
slightly
arrested
by
the
great
verulam
and
is
in
the
humour
to
think
a
dead
philosopher
less
interesting
than
a
living
gardener
who
sits
conspicuous
in
the
round
the
fireplace
bates
is
habitually
a
guest
in
the
housekeeper
room
of
an
evening
preferring
the
social
pleasures
there
the
feast
of
gossip
and
the
flow
of
grog
to
a
bachelor
chair
in
his
charming
thatched
cottage
on
a
little
island
where
every
sound
is
remote
but
the
cawing
of
rooks
and
the
screaming
of
wild
geese
poetic
sounds
doubtless
but
humanly
speaking
not
convivial
bates
was
by
no
means
an
average
person
to
be
passed
without
special
notice
he
was
a
sturdy
yorkshireman
approaching
forty
whose
face
nature
seemed
to
have
coloured
when
she
was
in
a
hurry
and
had
no
time
to
attend
to
for
every
inch
of
him
visible
above
his
neckcloth
was
of
one
impartial
redness
so
that
when
he
was
at
some
distance
your
imagination
was
at
liberty
to
place
his
lips
anywhere
between
his
nose
and
chin
seen
closer
his
lips
were
discerned
to
be
of
a
peculiar
cut
and
i
fancy
this
had
something
to
do
with
the
peculiarity
of
his
dialect
which
as
we
shall
see
was
individual
rather
than
provincial
bates
was
further
distinguished
from
the
common
herd
by
a
perpetual
blinking
of
the
eyes
and
this
together
with
the
tint
of
his
complexion
and
a
way
he
had
of
hanging
his
head
forward
and
rolling
it
from
side
to
side
as
he
walked
gave
him
the
air
of
a
bacchus
in
a
blue
apron
who
in
the
present
reduced
circumstances
of
olympus
had
taken
to
the
management
of
his
own
vines
yet
as
gluttons
are
often
thin
so
sober
men
are
often
rubicund
and
bates
was
sober
with
that
manly
british
sobriety
which
can
carry
a
few
glasses
of
grog
without
any
perceptible
clarification
of
ideas
my
boottons
observed
bates
who
at
the
conclusion
of
sharp
narrative
felt
himself
urged
to
his
strongest
interjection
what
i
should
ha
looked
for
from
sir
cristhifer
an
my
ledy
to
bring
a
furrin
child
into
the
coonthry
an
depend
o
whether
you

said
sharp
with
the
air
of
a
person
who
held
liberal
views
but
knew
where
to
draw
the
line
not
to
defend
the
furriners
for
i
as
good
reason
to
know
what
they
are
as
most
folks
an
nobody
ever
hear
me
say
but
what
they
next
door
to
heathens
and
the
hile
they
eat
wi
their
victuals
is
enough
to
turn
any
christian
stomach

for
all
that

but
what
does
my
lady
say
lady
knows
better
than
cross
sir
cristifer
in
what
he
set
his
mind
on
said
bellamy
who
objected
to
the
critical
tone
of
the
conversation
cristifer
hev
his
own
way
you
may
tek

i

an
my

and
then
you
shall
give
us
a
song
sir
cristifer
does
come
hum
from
italy
ivery
night
this
demonstrable
position
was
accepted
without
hesitation
as
ground
for
a
toast
but
bates
apparently
thinking
that
his
song
was
not
an
equally
reasonable
sequence
ignored
the
second
part
of
proposal
so
sharp
who
had
been
heard
to
say
that
she
had
no
thoughts
at
all
of
marrying
bates
though
he
was
sensable
man
as
many
a
woman
snap
at
for
a
husband
enforced
bellamy
appeal
bates
let
us
hear
roy
wife
i
rether
hear
a
good
old
song
like
that
nor
all
the
fine
italian
toodlin
bates
urged
thus
flatteringly
stuck
his
thumbs
into
the
armholes
of
his
waistcoat
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
with
his
head
in
that
position
in
which
he
could
look
directly
towards
the
zenith
and
struck
up
a
remarkably
rendering
of
wife
of
aldivalloch
this
melody
may
certainly
be
taxed
with
excessive
iteration
but
that
was
precisely
its
highest
recommendation
to
the
present
audience
who
found
it
all
the
easier
to
swell
the
chorus
nor
did
it
at
all
diminish
their
pleasure
that
the
only
particular
concerning
wife
which
bates
enunciation
allowed
them
to
gather
was
that
she
him
whether
in
the
matter
of
garden
stuff
or
of
some
other
commodity
or
why
her
name
should
in
consequence
be
repeatedly
reiterated
with
exultation
remaining
an
agreeable
mystery
bates
song
formed
the
climax
of
the
evening
and
the
party
soon
after
dispersed
bellamy
perhaps
to
dream
of
quicklime
flying
among
her
or
of
housemaids
reckless
of
unswept
corners
and
sharp
to
sink
into
pleasant
visions
of
independent
housekeeping
in
bates
cottage
with
no
bells
to
answer
and
with
fruit
and
ad
caterina
soon
conquered
all
prejudices
against
her
foreign
blood
for
what
prejudices
will
hold
out
against
helplessness
and
broken
prattle
she
became
the
pet
of
the
household
thrusting
sir
favourite
bloodhound
of
that
day
bellamy
two
canaries
and
bates
largest
dorking
hen
into
a
merely
secondary
position
the
consequence
was
that
in
the
space
of
a
summer
day
she
went
through
a
great
cycle
of
experiences
commencing
with
the
somewhat
acidulated
goodwill
of
sharp
nursery
discipline
then
came
the
grave
luxury
of
her
ladyship
and
perhaps
the
dignity
of
a
ride
on
sir
christopher
knee
sometimes
followed
by
a
visit
with
him
to
the
stables
where
caterina
soon
learned
to
hear
without
crying
the
baying
of
the
chained
bloodhounds
and
say
with
ostentatious
bravery
clinging
to
sir
christopher
leg
all
the
while
not
hurt
tina
then
bellamy
would
perhaps
be
going
out
to
gather
the
and
lavender
and
tina
was
made
proud
and
happy
by
being
allowed
to
carry
a
handful
in
her
pinafore
happier
still
when
they
were
spread
out
on
sheets
to
dry
so
that
she
could
sit
down
like
a
frog
among
them
and
have
them
poured
over
her
in
fragrant
showers
another
frequent
pleasure
was
to
take
a
journey
with
bates
through
the
and
the
hothouses
where
the
rich
bunches
of
green
and
purple
grapes
hung
from
the
roof
far
out
of
reach
of
the
tiny
yellow
hand
that
could
not
help
stretching
itself
out
towards
them
though
the
hand
was
sure
at
last
to
be
satisfied
with
some
fruit
or
flower
indeed
in
the
long
monotonous
leisure
of
that
great
you
may
be
sure
there
was
always
some
one
who
had
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
play
with
tina
so
that
the
little
southern
bird
had
its
northern
nest
lined
with
tenderness
and
caresses
and
pretty
things
a
loving
sensitive
nature
was
too
likely
under
such
nurture
to
have
its
susceptibility
heightened
into
unfitness
for
an
encounter
with
any
harder
experience
all
the
more
because
there
were
gleams
of
fierce
resistance
to
any
discipline
that
had
a
harsh
or
unloving
aspect
for
the
only
thing
in
which
caterina
showed
any
precocity
was
a
certain
ingenuity
in
vindictiveness
when
she
was
five
years
old
she
had
revenged
herself
for
an
unpleasant
prohibition
by
pouring
the
ink
into
and
once
when
lady
cheverel
took
her
doll
from
her
because
she
was
affectionately
licking
the
paint
off
its
face
the
little
minx
straightway
climbed
on
a
chair
and
threw
down
a
that
stood
on
a
bracket
this
was
almost
the
only
instance
in
which
her
anger
overcame
her
awe
of
lady
cheverel
who
had
the
ascendancy
always
belonging
to
kindness
that
never
melts
into
caresses
and
is
severely
but
uniformly
beneficent
the
happy
monotony
of
cheverel
manor
was
broken
in
upon
in
the
way
warren
had
announced
the
roads
through
the
park
were
cut
up
by
waggons
carrying
loads
of
stone
from
a
neighbouring
quarry
the
green
courtyard
became
dusty
with
lime
and
the
peaceful
house
rang
with
the
sound
of
tools
for
the
next
ten
years
sir
christopher
was
occupied
with
the
architectural
metamorphosis
of
his
old
family
mansion
thus
anticipating
through
the
prompting
of
his
individual
taste
that
general
reaction
from
the
insipid
imitation
of
the
palladian
style
towards
a
restoration
of
the
gothic
which
marked
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
this
was
the
object
he
had
set
his
heart
on
with
a
singleness
of
determination
which
was
regarded
with
not
a
little
contempt
by
his
neighbours
who
wondered
greatly
that
a
man
with
some
of
the
best
blood
in
england
in
his
veins
should
be
mean
enough
to
economize
in
his
cellar
and
reduce
his
stud
to
two
old
and
a
hack
for
the
sake
of
riding
a
hobby
and
playing
the
architect
their
wives
did
not
see
so
much
to
blame
in
the
matter
of
the
cellar
and
stables
but
they
were
eloquent
in
pity
for
poor
lady
cheverel
who
had
to
live
in
no
more
than
three
rooms
at
once
and
who
must
be
distracted
with
noises
and
have
her
constitution
undermined
by
unhealthy
smells
it
was
as
bad
as
having
a
husband
with
an
asthma
why
did
not
sir
christopher
take
a
house
for
her
at
bath
or
at
least
if
he
must
spend
his
time
in
overlooking
workmen
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
manor
this
pity
was
quite
gratuitous
as
the
most
plentiful
pity
always
is
for
though
lady
cheverel
did
not
share
her
husband
architectural
enthusiasm
she
had
too
rigorous
a
view
of
a
wife
duties
and
too
profound
a
deference
for
sir
christopher
to
regard
submission
as
a
grievance
as
for
sir
christopher
he
was
perfectly
indifferent
to
criticism
obstinate
crotchety
man
said
his
neighbours
but
i
who
have
seen
cheverel
manor
as
he
bequeathed
it
to
his
heirs
rather
attribute
that
unswerving
architectural
purpose
of
his
conceived
and
carried
out
through
long
years
of
systematic
personal
exertion
to
something
of
the
fervour
of
genius
as
well
as
inflexibility
of
will
and
in
walking
through
those
rooms
with
their
splendid
ceilings
and
their
meagre
furniture
which
tell
how
all
the
spare
money
had
been
absorbed
before
personal
comfort
was
thought
of
i
have
felt
that
there
dwelt
in
this
old
english
baronet
some
of
that
sublime
spirit
which
distinguishes
art
from
luxury
and
worships
beauty
apart
from
while
cheverel
manor
was
growing
from
ugliness
into
beauty
caterina
too
was
growing
from
a
little
yellow
bantling
into
a
whiter
maiden
with
no
positive
beauty
indeed
but
with
a
certain
light
airy
grace
which
with
her
large
appealing
dark
eyes
and
a
voice
that
in
its
tenderness
recalled
the
of
the
gave
her
a
more
than
usual
charm
unlike
the
building
however
caterina
development
was
the
result
of
no
systematic
or
careful
appliances
she
grew
up
very
much
like
the
primroses
which
the
gardener
is
not
sorry
to
see
within
his
enclosure
but
takes
no
pains
to
cultivate
lady
cheverel
taught
her
to
read
and
write
and
say
her
catechism
warren
being
a
good
accountant
gave
her
lessons
in
arithmetic
by
her
ladyship
desire
and
sharp
initiated
her
in
all
the
mysteries
of
the
needle
but
for
a
long
time
there
was
no
thought
of
giving
her
any
more
elaborate
education
it
is
very
likely
that
to
her
dying
day
caterina
thought
the
earth
stood
still
and
that
the
sun
and
stars
moved
round
it
but
so
for
the
matter
of
that
did
helen
and
dido
and
desdemona
and
juliet
whence
i
hope
you
will
not
think
my
caterina
less
worthy
to
be
a
heroine
on
that
account
the
truth
is
that
with
one
exception
her
only
talent
lay
in
loving
and
there
it
is
probable
the
most
astronomical
of
women
could
not
have
surpassed
her
orphan
and
protegee
though
she
was
this
supreme
talent
of
hers
found
plenty
of
exercise
at
cheverel
manor
and
caterina
had
more
people
to
love
than
many
a
small
lady
and
gentleman
affluent
in
silver
mugs
and
blood
relations
i
think
the
first
place
in
her
childish
heart
was
given
to
sir
christopher
for
little
girls
are
apt
to
attach
themselves
to
the
gentleman
at
hand
especially
as
he
seldom
has
anything
to
do
with
discipline
next
to
the
baronet
came
dorcas
the
merry
damsel
who
was
sharp
lieutenant
in
the
nursery
and
thus
played
the
part
of
the
raisins
in
a
dose
of
senna
it
was
a
black
day
for
caterina
when
dorcas
married
the
coachman
and
went
with
a
great
sense
of
elevation
in
the
world
to
preside
over
a
in
the
noisy
town
of
sloppeter
a
little
bearing
the
motto
lost
to
sight
to
memory
dear
which
dorcas
sent
her
as
a
remembrance
was
among
caterina
treasures
ten
years
after
the
one
other
exceptional
talent
you
already
guess
was
music
when
the
fact
that
caterina
had
a
remarkable
ear
for
music
and
a
still
more
remarkable
voice
attracted
lady
cheverel
notice
the
discovery
was
very
welcome
both
to
her
and
sir
christopher
her
musical
education
became
at
once
an
object
of
interest
lady
cheverel
devoted
much
time
to
it
and
the
rapidity
of
tina
progress
surpassing
all
hopes
an
italian
was
engaged
for
several
years
to
spend
some
months
together
at
cheverel
manor
this
unexpected
gift
made
a
great
alteration
in
caterina
position
after
those
first
years
in
which
little
girls
are
petted
like
puppies
and
kittens
there
comes
a
time
when
it
seems
less
obvious
what
they
can
be
good
for
especially
when
like
caterina
they
give
no
particular
promise
of
cleverness
or
beauty
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
in
that
uninteresting
period
there
was
no
particular
plan
formed
as
to
her
future
position
she
could
always
help
sharp
supposing
she
were
fit
for
nothing
else
as
she
grew
up
but
now
this
rare
gift
of
song
endeared
her
to
lady
cheverel
who
loved
music
above
all
things
and
it
associated
her
at
once
with
the
pleasures
of
the
insensibly
she
came
to
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
family
and
the
servants
began
to
understand
that
miss
sarti
was
to
be
a
lady
after
all
the
raight
o
too
said
bates
she
has
the
cut
of
a
gell
as
must
work
for
her
bread
she
as
nesh
an
dilicate
as
a
welly
laike
a
linnet
wi
joost
body
anoof
to
hold
her
voice
but
long
before
tina
had
reached
this
stage
of
her
history
a
new
era
had
begun
for
her
in
the
arrival
of
a
younger
companion
than
any
she
had
hitherto
known
when
she
was
no
more
than
seven
a
ward
of
sir
christopher
a
lad
of
fifteen
maynard
gilfil
by
name
began
to
spend
his
vacations
at
cheverel
manor
and
found
there
no
playfellow
so
much
to
his
mind
as
caterina
maynard
was
an
affectionate
lad
who
retained
a
propensity
to
white
rabbits
pet
squirrels
and
perhaps
a
little
beyond
the
age
at
which
young
gentlemen
usually
look
down
on
such
pleasures
as
puerile
he
was
also
much
given
to
fishing
and
to
carpentry
considered
as
a
fine
art
without
any
base
view
to
utility
and
in
all
these
pleasures
it
was
his
delight
to
have
caterina
as
his
companion
to
call
her
little
pet
names
answer
her
wondering
questions
and
have
her
toddling
after
him
as
you
may
have
seen
a
blenheim
spaniel
trotting
after
a
large
setter
whenever
maynard
went
back
to
school
there
was
a
little
scene
of
parting
wo
forget
me
tina
before
i
come
back
again
i
shall
leave
you
all
the
we
made
and
do
you
let
guinea
die
come
give
me
a
kiss
and
promise
not
to
forget
me
as
the
years
wore
on
and
maynard
passed
from
school
to
college
and
from
a
slim
lad
to
a
stalwart
young
man
their
companionship
in
the
vacations
necessarily
took
a
different
form
but
it
retained
a
brotherly
and
sisterly
familiarity
with
maynard
the
boyish
affection
had
insensibly
grown
into
ardent
love
among
all
the
many
kinds
of
first
love
that
which
begins
in
childish
companionship
is
the
strongest
and
most
enduring
when
passion
comes
to
unite
its
force
to
long
affection
love
is
at
its
and
maynard
gilfil
love
was
of
a
kind
to
make
him
prefer
being
tormented
by
caterina
to
any
pleasure
apart
from
her
which
the
most
benevolent
magician
could
have
devised
for
him
it
is
the
way
with
those
tall
men
from
samson
downwards
as
for
tina
the
little
minx
was
perfectly
well
aware
that
maynard
was
her
slave
he
was
the
one
person
in
the
world
whom
she
did
as
she
pleased
with
and
i
need
not
tell
you
that
this
was
a
symptom
of
her
being
perfectly
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
for
a
passionate
woman
love
is
always
overshadowed
by
fear
maynard
gilfil
did
not
deceive
himself
in
his
interpretation
of
caterina
feelings
but
he
nursed
the
hope
that
some
time
or
other
she
would
at
least
care
enough
for
him
to
accept
his
love
so
he
waited
patiently
for
the
day
when
he
might
venture
to
say
i
love
you
you
see
he
would
have
been
content
with
very
little
being
one
of
those
men
who
pass
through
life
without
making
the
least
clamour
about
themselves
thinking
neither
the
cut
of
his
coat
nor
the
flavour
of
his
soup
nor
the
precise
depth
of
a
servant
bow
at
all
momentous
he
thought
foolishly
enough
as
lovers
think
that
it
was
a
good
augury
for
him
when
he
came
to
be
domesticated
at
cheverel
manor
in
the
quality
of
chaplain
there
and
curate
of
a
neighbouring
parish
judging
falsely
from
his
own
case
that
habit
and
affection
were
the
likeliest
avenues
to
love
sir
christopher
satisfied
several
feelings
in
installing
maynard
as
chaplain
in
his
house
he
liked
the
dignity
of
that
domestic
appendage
he
liked
his
ward
companionship
and
as
maynard
had
some
private
fortune
he
might
take
life
easily
in
that
agreeable
home
keeping
his
hunter
and
observing
a
mild
regimen
of
clerical
duty
until
the
cumbermoor
living
should
fall
in
when
he
might
be
settled
for
life
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
manor
caterina
for
a
wife
too
sir
christopher
soon
began
to
think
for
though
the
good
baronet
was
not
at
all
quick
to
suspect
what
was
unpleasant
and
opposed
to
his
views
of
fitness
he
was
quick
to
see
what
would
dovetail
with
his
own
plans
and
he
had
first
guessed
and
then
ascertained
by
direct
inquiry
the
state
of
maynard
feelings
he
at
once
leaped
to
the
conclusion
that
caterina
was
of
the
same
mind
or
at
least
would
be
when
she
was
old
enough
but
these
were
too
early
days
for
anything
definite
to
be
said
or
done
meanwhile
new
circumstances
were
arising
which
though
they
made
no
change
in
sir
christopher
plans
and
prospects
converted
hopes
into
anxieties
and
made
it
clear
to
him
not
only
that
heart
was
never
likely
to
be
his
but
that
it
was
given
entirely
to
another
once
or
twice
in
caterina
childhood
there
had
been
another
at
the
manor
younger
than
maynard
gilfil
a
beautiful
boy
with
brown
curls
and
splendid
clothes
on
whom
caterina
had
looked
with
shy
admiration
this
was
anthony
wybrow
the
son
of
sir
youngest
sister
and
chosen
heir
of
cheverel
manor
the
baronet
had
sacrificed
a
large
sum
and
even
straitened
the
resources
by
which
he
was
to
carry
out
his
architectural
schemes
for
the
sake
of
removing
the
entail
from
his
estate
and
making
this
boy
his
heir
moved
to
the
step
i
am
sorry
to
say
by
an
implacable
quarrel
with
his
elder
sister
for
a
power
of
forgiveness
was
not
among
sir
christopher
virtues
at
length
on
the
death
of
anthony
mother
when
he
was
no
longer
a
boy
but
a
tall
young
man
with
a
captain
commission
cheverel
manor
became
home
too
whenever
he
was
absent
from
his
regiment
caterina
was
then
a
little
woman
between
sixteen
and
seventeen
and
i
need
not
spend
many
words
in
explaining
what
you
perceive
to
be
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
there
was
little
company
kept
at
the
manor
and
captain
wybrow
would
have
been
much
duller
if
caterina
had
not
been
there
it
was
pleasant
to
pay
her
attentions
to
speak
to
her
in
gentle
tones
to
see
her
little
flutter
of
pleasure
the
blush
that
just
lit
up
her
pale
cheek
and
the
momentary
timid
glance
of
her
dark
eyes
when
he
praised
her
singing
leaning
at
her
side
over
the
piano
pleasant
too
to
cut
out
that
chaplain
with
his
large
calves
what
idle
man
can
withstand
the
temptation
of
a
woman
to
fascinate
and
another
man
to
eclipse
especially
when
it
is
quite
clear
to
himself
that
he
means
no
mischief
and
shall
leave
everything
to
come
right
again
at
the
end
of
eighteen
months
however
during
which
captain
wybrow
had
spent
much
of
his
time
at
the
manor
he
found
that
matters
had
reached
a
point
which
he
had
not
at
all
contemplated
gentle
tones
had
led
to
tender
words
and
tender
words
had
called
forth
a
response
of
looks
which
made
it
impossible
not
to
carry
on
the
of
to
find
one
self
adored
by
a
little
graceful
woman
whom
no
one
need
despise
is
an
agreeable
sensation
comparable
to
smoking
the
finest
latakia
and
also
imposes
some
return
of
tenderness
as
a
duty
perhaps
you
think
that
captain
wybrow
who
knew
that
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
dream
of
his
marrying
caterina
must
have
been
a
reckless
libertine
to
win
her
affections
in
this
manner
not
at
all
he
was
a
young
man
of
calm
passions
who
was
rarely
led
into
any
conduct
of
which
he
could
not
give
a
plausible
account
to
himself
and
the
tiny
fragile
caterina
was
a
woman
who
touched
the
imagination
and
the
affections
rather
than
the
senses
he
really
felt
very
kindly
towards
her
and
would
very
likely
have
loved
her
if
he
had
been
able
to
love
any
one
but
nature
had
not
endowed
him
with
that
capability
she
had
given
him
an
admirable
figure
the
whitest
of
hands
the
most
delicate
of
nostrils
and
a
large
amount
of
serene
but
as
if
to
save
such
a
delicate
piece
of
work
from
any
risk
of
being
shattered
she
had
guarded
him
from
the
liability
to
a
strong
emotion
there
was
no
list
of
youthful
misdemeanours
on
record
against
him
and
sir
christopher
and
lady
cheverel
thought
him
the
best
of
nephews
the
most
satisfactory
of
heirs
full
of
grateful
deference
to
themselves
and
above
all
things
guided
by
a
sense
of
duty
captain
wybrow
always
did
the
thing
easiest
and
most
agreeable
to
him
from
a
sense
of
duty
he
dressed
expensively
because
it
was
a
duty
he
owed
to
his
position
from
a
sense
of
duty
he
adapted
himself
to
sir
christopher
inflexible
will
which
it
would
have
been
troublesome
as
well
as
useless
to
resist
and
being
of
a
delicate
constitution
he
took
care
of
his
health
from
a
sense
of
duty
his
health
was
the
only
point
on
which
he
gave
anxiety
to
his
friends
and
it
was
owing
to
this
that
sir
christopher
wished
to
see
his
nephew
early
married
the
more
so
as
a
match
after
the
baronet
own
heart
appeared
immediately
attainable
anthony
had
seen
and
admired
miss
assher
the
only
child
of
a
lady
who
had
been
sir
christopher
earliest
love
but
who
as
things
will
happen
in
this
world
had
married
another
baronet
instead
of
him
miss
assher
father
was
now
dead
and
she
was
in
possession
of
a
pretty
estate
if
as
was
probable
she
should
prove
susceptible
to
the
merits
of
anthony
person
and
character
nothing
could
make
sir
christopher
so
happy
as
to
see
a
marriage
which
might
be
expected
to
secure
the
inheritance
of
cheverel
manor
from
getting
into
the
wrong
hands
anthony
had
already
been
kindly
received
by
lady
assher
as
the
nephew
of
her
early
friend
why
should
he
not
go
to
bath
where
she
and
her
daughter
were
then
residing
follow
up
the
acquaintance
and
win
a
handsome
and
sufficiently
wealthy
bride
sir
christopher
wishes
were
communicated
to
his
nephew
who
at
once
intimated
his
willingness
to
comply
with
them
from
a
sense
of
duty
caterina
was
tenderly
informed
by
her
lover
of
the
sacrifice
demanded
from
them
both
and
three
days
afterwards
occurred
the
parting
scene
you
have
witnessed
in
the
gallery
on
the
eve
of
captain
wybrow
departure
for
bath
chapter
the
inexorable
ticking
of
the
clock
is
like
the
throb
of
pain
to
sensations
made
keen
by
a
sickening
fear
and
so
it
is
with
the
great
clockwork
of
nature
daisies
and
buttercups
give
way
to
the
brown
waving
grasses
tinged
with
the
warm
red
sorrel
the
waving
grasses
are
swept
away
and
the
meadows
lie
like
emeralds
set
in
the
bushy
hedgerows
the
corn
begins
to
bow
with
the
weight
of
the
full
ear
the
reapers
are
bending
amongst
it
and
it
soon
stands
in
sheaves
then
presently
the
patches
of
yellow
stubble
lie
side
by
side
with
streaks
of
earth
which
the
plough
is
turning
up
in
preparation
for
the
seed
and
this
passage
from
beauty
to
beauty
which
to
the
happy
is
like
the
flow
of
a
melody
measures
for
many
a
human
heart
the
approach
of
foreseen
anguish
seems
hurrying
on
the
moment
when
the
shadow
of
dread
will
be
followed
up
by
the
reality
of
despair
how
cruelly
hasty
that
summer
of
seemed
to
caterina
surely
the
roses
vanished
earlier
and
the
berries
on
the
were
more
impatient
to
redden
and
bring
on
the
autumn
when
she
would
be
face
to
face
with
her
misery
and
witness
anthony
giving
all
his
gentle
tones
tender
words
and
soft
looks
to
another
before
the
end
of
july
captain
wybrow
had
written
word
that
lady
assher
and
her
daughter
were
about
to
fly
from
the
heat
and
gaiety
of
bath
to
the
shady
quiet
of
their
place
at
farleigh
and
that
he
was
invited
to
join
the
party
there
his
letters
implied
that
he
was
on
an
excellent
footing
with
both
the
ladies
and
gave
no
hint
of
a
rival
so
that
sir
christopher
was
more
than
usually
bright
and
cheerful
after
reading
them
at
length
towards
the
close
of
august
came
the
announcement
that
captain
wybrow
was
an
accepted
lover
and
after
much
complimentary
and
congratulatory
correspondence
between
the
two
families
it
was
understood
that
in
september
lady
assher
and
her
daughter
would
pay
a
visit
to
cheverel
manor
when
beatrice
would
make
the
acquaintance
of
her
future
relatives
and
all
needful
arrangements
could
be
discussed
captain
wybrow
would
remain
at
farleigh
till
then
and
accompany
the
ladies
on
their
journey
in
the
interval
every
one
at
cheverel
manor
had
something
to
do
by
way
of
preparing
for
the
visitors
sir
christopher
was
occupied
in
consultations
with
his
steward
and
lawyer
and
in
giving
orders
to
every
one
else
especially
in
spurring
on
francesco
to
finish
the
saloon
gilfil
had
the
responsibility
of
procuring
a
lady
horse
miss
assher
being
a
great
rider
lady
cheverel
had
unwonted
calls
to
make
and
invitations
to
deliver
bates
turf
and
gravel
and
were
always
at
such
a
point
of
neatness
and
finish
that
nothing
extraordinary
could
be
done
in
the
garden
except
a
little
extraordinary
scolding
of
the
and
this
addition
bates
did
not
neglect
happily
for
caterina
she
too
had
her
task
to
fill
up
the
long
dreary
daytime
it
was
to
finish
a
which
would
complete
the
set
of
embroidered
covers
for
the
lady
cheverel
work
and
the
only
noteworthy
bit
of
furniture
in
the
manor
over
this
embroidery
she
sat
with
cold
lips
and
a
palpitating
heart
thankful
that
this
miserable
sensation
throughout
the
daytime
seemed
to
counteract
the
tendency
to
tears
which
returned
with
night
and
solitude
she
was
most
frightened
when
sir
christopher
approached
her
the
baronet
eye
was
brighter
and
his
step
more
elastic
than
ever
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
only
the
most
leaden
or
churlish
souls
could
be
otherwise
than
brisk
and
exulting
in
a
world
where
everything
went
so
well
dear
old
gentleman
he
had
gone
through
life
a
little
flushed
with
the
power
of
his
will
and
now
his
latest
plan
was
succeeding
and
cheverel
manor
would
be
inherited
by
a
whom
he
might
even
yet
live
to
see
a
fine
young
fellow
with
at
least
the
down
on
his
chin
why
not
one
is
still
young
at
sixty
sir
christopher
had
always
something
playful
to
say
to
caterina
little
monkey
you
must
be
in
your
best
voice
you
the
minstrel
of
the
manor
you
know
and
be
sure
you
have
a
pretty
gown
and
a
new
ribbon
you
must
not
be
dressed
in
russet
though
you
are
a
or
perhaps
is
your
turn
to
be
courted
next
tina
but
do
you
learn
any
naughty
proud
airs
i
must
have
maynard
let
off
easily
caterina
affection
for
the
old
baronet
helped
her
to
summon
up
a
smile
as
he
stroked
her
cheek
and
looked
at
her
kindly
but
that
was
the
moment
at
which
she
felt
it
most
difficult
not
to
burst
out
crying
lady
cheverel
conversation
and
presence
were
less
trying
for
her
ladyship
felt
no
more
than
calm
satisfaction
in
this
family
event
and
besides
she
was
further
sobered
by
a
little
jealousy
at
sir
anticipation
of
pleasure
in
seeing
lady
assher
enshrined
in
his
memory
as
a
beauty
of
sixteen
with
whom
he
had
exchanged
locks
before
he
went
on
his
first
travels
lady
cheverel
would
have
died
rather
than
confess
it
but
she
could
help
hoping
that
he
would
be
disappointed
in
lady
assher
and
rather
ashamed
of
having
called
her
so
charming
gilfil
watched
caterina
through
these
days
with
mixed
feelings
her
suffering
went
to
his
heart
but
even
for
her
sake
he
was
glad
that
a
love
which
could
never
come
to
good
should
be
no
longer
fed
by
false
hopes
and
how
could
he
help
saying
to
himself
after
a
while
caterina
will
be
tired
of
fretting
about
that
puppy
and
then
at
length
the
day
arrived
and
the
brightest
of
september
suns
was
lighting
up
the
yellowing
as
about
five
lady
assher
carriage
drove
under
the
portico
caterina
seated
at
work
in
her
own
room
heard
the
rolling
of
the
wheels
followed
presently
by
the
opening
and
shutting
of
doors
and
the
sound
of
voices
in
the
corridors
remembering
that
the
was
six
and
that
lady
cheverel
had
desired
her
to
be
in
the
early
she
started
up
to
dress
and
was
delighted
to
find
herself
feeling
suddenly
brave
and
strong
curiosity
to
see
miss
assher
the
thought
that
anthony
was
in
the
house
the
wish
not
to
look
unattractive
were
feelings
that
brought
some
colour
to
her
lips
and
made
it
easy
to
attend
to
her
toilette
they
would
ask
her
to
sing
this
evening
and
she
would
sing
well
miss
assher
should
not
think
her
utterly
insignificant
so
she
put
on
her
grey
silk
gown
and
her
cherry
coloured
ribbon
with
as
much
care
as
if
she
had
been
herself
the
betrothed
not
forgetting
the
pair
of
round
pearl
earrings
which
sir
christopher
had
told
lady
cheverel
to
give
her
because
tina
little
ears
were
so
pretty
quick
as
she
had
been
she
found
sir
christopher
and
lady
cheverel
in
the
chatting
with
gilfil
and
telling
him
how
handsome
miss
assher
was
but
how
entirely
unlike
her
mother
apparently
resembling
her
father
only
said
sir
christopher
as
he
turned
to
look
at
caterina
do
you
think
of
this
maynard
did
you
ever
see
tina
look
so
pretty
before
why
that
little
grey
gown
has
been
made
out
of
a
bit
of
my
lady
has
it
it
does
take
anything
much
larger
than
a
to
dress
the
little
monkey
lady
cheverel
too
serenely
radiant
in
the
assurance
a
single
glance
had
given
her
of
lady
assher
inferiority
smiled
approval
and
caterina
was
in
one
of
those
moods
of
self
possession
and
indifference
which
come
as
the
between
the
struggles
of
passion
she
retired
to
the
piano
and
busied
herself
with
arranging
her
music
not
at
all
insensible
to
the
pleasure
of
being
looked
at
with
admiration
the
while
and
thinking
that
the
next
time
the
door
opened
captain
wybrow
would
enter
and
she
would
speak
to
him
quite
cheerfully
but
when
she
heard
him
come
in
and
the
scent
of
roses
floated
towards
her
her
heart
gave
one
great
leap
she
knew
nothing
till
he
was
pressing
her
hand
and
saying
in
the
old
easy
way
caterina
how
do
you
do
you
look
quite
blooming
she
felt
her
cheeks
reddening
with
anger
that
he
could
speak
and
look
with
such
perfect
nonchalance
ah
he
was
too
deeply
in
love
with
some
one
else
to
remember
anything
he
had
felt
for
but
the
next
moment
she
was
conscious
of
her
folly
if
he
could
show
any
feeling
then
this
conflict
of
emotions
stretched
into
a
long
interval
the
few
moments
that
elapsed
before
the
door
opened
again
and
her
own
attention
as
well
as
that
of
all
the
rest
was
absorbed
by
the
entrance
of
the
two
ladies
the
daughter
was
the
more
striking
from
the
contrast
she
presented
to
her
mother
a
woman
who
had
once
had
the
transient
beauty
of
a
blonde
with
features
and
early
embonpoint
miss
assher
was
tall
and
gracefully
though
substantially
formed
carrying
herself
with
an
air
of
mingled
graciousness
and
her
hair
untouched
by
powder
hanging
in
bushy
curls
round
her
face
and
falling
in
long
thick
ringlets
nearly
to
her
waist
the
brilliant
carmine
tint
of
her
cheeks
and
the
outline
of
her
straight
nose
produced
an
impression
of
splendid
beauty
in
spite
of
commonplace
brown
eyes
a
narrow
forehead
and
thin
lips
she
was
in
mourning
and
the
dead
black
of
her
crape
dress
relieved
here
and
there
by
jet
ornaments
gave
the
fullest
effect
to
her
complexion
and
to
the
rounded
whiteness
of
her
arms
bare
from
the
elbow
the
first
coup
was
dazzling
and
as
she
stood
looking
down
with
a
gracious
smile
on
caterina
whom
lady
cheverel
was
presenting
to
her
the
poor
little
thing
seemed
to
herself
to
feel
for
the
first
time
all
the
folly
of
her
former
dream
are
enchanted
with
your
place
sir
christopher
said
lady
assher
with
a
feeble
kind
of
pompousness
which
she
seemed
to
be
copying
from
some
one
else
sure
your
nephew
must
have
thought
farleigh
wretchedly
out
of
order
poor
sir
john
was
so
very
careless
about
keeping
up
the
house
and
grounds
i
often
talked
to
him
about
it
but
he
said
pooh
pooh
as
long
as
my
friends
find
a
good
dinner
and
a
good
bottle
of
wine
they
wo
care
about
my
ceilings
being
rather
smoky
he
was
so
very
hospitable
was
sir
john
think
the
view
of
the
house
from
the
park
just
after
we
passed
the
bridge
particularly
fine
said
miss
assher
interposing
rather
eagerly
as
if
she
feared
her
mother
might
be
making
infelicitous
speeches
the
pleasure
of
the
first
glimpse
was
all
the
greater
because
anthony
would
describe
nothing
to
us
beforehand
he
would
not
spoil
our
first
impressions
by
raising
false
ideas
i
long
to
go
over
the
house
sir
christopher
and
learn
the
history
of
all
your
architectural
designs
which
anthony
says
have
cost
you
so
much
time
and
study
care
how
you
set
an
old
man
talking
about
the
past
my
dear
said
the
baronet
hope
we
shall
find
something
pleasanter
for
you
to
do
than
turning
over
my
old
plans
and
pictures
our
friend
gilfil
here
has
found
a
beautiful
mare
for
you
and
you
can
scour
the
country
to
your
heart
content
anthony
has
sent
us
word
what
a
horsewoman
you
are
miss
assher
turned
to
gilfil
with
her
most
beaming
smile
and
expressed
her
thanks
with
the
elaborate
graciousness
of
a
person
who
means
to
be
thought
charming
and
is
sure
of
success
do
not
thank
me
said
gilfil
you
have
tried
the
mare
she
has
been
ridden
by
lady
sara
linter
for
the
last
two
years
but
one
lady
taste
may
not
be
like
another
in
horses
any
more
than
in
other
matters
while
this
conversation
was
passing
captain
wybrow
was
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
contenting
himself
with
responding
from
under
his
indolent
eyelids
to
the
glances
miss
assher
was
constantly
directing
towards
him
as
she
spoke
is
very
much
in
love
with
him
thought
caterina
but
she
was
relieved
that
anthony
remained
passive
in
his
attentions
she
thought
too
that
he
was
looking
paler
and
more
languid
than
usual
he
did
love
her
very
much
if
he
sometimes
thought
of
the
past
with
regret
i
think
i
could
bear
it
all
and
be
glad
to
see
sir
christopher
made
happy
during
dinner
there
was
a
little
incident
which
confirmed
these
thoughts
when
the
sweets
were
on
the
table
there
was
a
mould
of
jelly
just
opposite
captain
wybrow
and
being
inclined
to
take
some
himself
he
first
invited
miss
assher
who
coloured
and
said
in
rather
a
sharper
key
than
usual
you
not
learned
by
this
time
that
i
never
take
jelly
you
said
captain
wybrow
whose
perceptions
were
not
acute
enough
for
him
to
notice
the
difference
of
a
semitone
should
have
thought
you
were
fond
of
it
there
was
always
some
on
the
table
at
farleigh
i
think
do
seem
to
take
much
interest
in
my
likes
and
dislikes
too
much
possessed
by
the
happy
thought
that
you
like
me
was
the
reply
in
silvery
tones
this
little
episode
was
unnoticed
by
every
one
but
caterina
sir
christopher
was
listening
with
polite
attention
to
lady
assher
history
of
her
last
who
was
at
gravies
and
for
that
reason
pleased
sir
john
he
was
so
particular
about
his
gravies
was
sir
john
and
so
they
kept
the
man
six
years
in
spite
of
his
bad
pastry
lady
cheverel
and
gilfil
were
smiling
at
rupert
the
bloodhound
who
had
pushed
his
great
head
under
his
master
arm
and
was
taking
a
survey
of
the
dishes
after
snuffing
at
the
contents
of
the
baronet
plate
when
the
ladies
were
in
the
again
lady
assher
was
soon
deep
in
a
statement
to
lady
cheverel
of
her
views
about
burying
people
in
woollen
be
sure
you
must
have
a
woollen
dress
because
it
the
law
you
know
but
that
need
hinder
no
one
from
putting
linen
underneath
i
always
used
to
say
if
sir
john
died
tomorrow
i
would
bury
him
in
his
shirt
and
i
did
and
let
me
advise
you
to
do
so
by
sir
christopher
you
never
saw
sir
john
lady
cheverel
he
was
a
large
tall
man
with
a
nose
just
like
beatrice
and
so
very
particular
about
his
shirts
miss
assher
meanwhile
had
seated
herself
by
caterina
and
with
that
smiling
affability
which
seems
to
say
am
really
not
at
all
proud
though
you
might
expect
it
of
me
said
tells
me
you
sing
so
very
beautifully
i
hope
we
shall
hear
you
this
evening
yes
said
caterina
quietly
without
smiling
always
sing
when
i
am
wanted
to
sing
envy
you
such
a
charming
talent
do
you
know
i
have
no
ear
i
can
not
hum
the
smallest
tune
and
i
delight
in
music
so
is
it
not
unfortunate
but
i
shall
have
quite
a
treat
while
i
am
here
captain
wybrow
says
you
will
give
us
some
music
every
day
should
have
thought
you
would
care
about
music
if
you
had
no
ear
said
caterina
becoming
epigrammatic
by
force
of
grave
simplicity
i
assure
you
i
doat
on
it
and
anthony
is
so
fond
of
it
it
would
be
so
delightful
if
i
could
play
and
sing
to
him
though
he
says
he
likes
me
best
not
to
sing
because
it
does
belong
to
his
idea
of
me
what
style
of
music
do
you
like
best
do
know
i
like
all
beautiful
music
are
you
as
fond
of
riding
as
of
music
i
never
ride
i
think
i
should
be
very
frightened
no
indeed
you
would
not
after
a
little
practice
i
have
never
been
in
the
least
timid
i
think
anthony
is
more
afraid
for
me
than
i
am
for
myself
and
since
i
have
been
riding
with
him
i
have
been
obliged
to
be
more
careful
because
he
is
so
nervous
about
me
caterina
made
no
reply
but
she
said
to
herself
wish
she
would
go
away
and
not
talk
to
me
she
only
wants
me
to
admire
her
and
to
talk
about
anthony
miss
assher
was
thinking
at
the
same
time
miss
sarti
seems
a
stupid
little
thing
those
musical
people
often
are
but
she
is
prettier
than
i
expected
anthony
said
she
was
not
pretty
happily
at
this
moment
lady
assher
called
her
daughter
attention
to
the
embroidered
cushions
and
miss
assher
walking
to
the
opposite
sofa
was
soon
in
conversation
with
lady
cheverel
about
tapestry
and
embroidery
in
general
while
her
mother
feeling
herself
superseded
there
came
and
placed
herself
beside
caterina
hear
you
are
the
most
beautiful
singer
was
of
course
the
opening
remark
italians
sing
so
beautifully
i
travelled
in
italy
with
sir
john
when
we
were
first
married
and
we
went
to
venice
where
they
go
about
in
gondolas
you
know
you
do
wear
powder
i
see
no
more
will
beatrice
though
many
people
think
her
curls
would
look
all
the
better
for
powder
she
has
so
much
hair
has
she
our
last
maid
dressed
it
much
better
than
this
but
do
you
know
she
wore
beatrice
stockings
before
they
went
to
the
wash
and
we
could
keep
her
after
that
could
we
caterina
accepting
the
question
as
a
mere
bit
of
rhetorical
effect
thought
it
superfluous
to
reply
till
lady
assher
repeated
we
now
as
if
tina
sanction
were
essential
to
her
repose
of
mind
after
a
faint
she
went
on
are
so
very
troublesome
and
beatrice
is
so
particular
you
imagine
i
often
say
to
her
my
dear
you
ca
have
perfection
that
very
gown
she
has
on
to
be
sure
it
fits
her
beautifully
now
but
it
has
been
unmade
and
made
up
again
twice
but
she
is
like
poor
sir
john
he
was
so
very
particular
about
his
own
things
was
sir
john
is
lady
cheverel
particular
but
sharp
has
been
her
maid
twenty
years
wish
there
was
any
chance
of
our
keeping
griffin
twenty
years
but
i
am
afraid
we
shall
have
to
part
with
her
because
her
health
is
so
delicate
and
she
is
so
obstinate
she
will
not
take
bitters
as
i
want
her
look
delicate
now
let
me
recommend
you
to
take
camomile
tea
in
a
morning
fasting
beatrice
is
so
strong
and
healthy
she
never
takes
any
medicine
but
if
i
had
had
twenty
girls
and
they
had
been
delicate
i
should
have
given
them
all
camomile
tea
it
strengthens
the
constitution
beyond
anything
now
will
you
promise
me
to
take
camomile
tea
you
i
not
at
all
ill
said
caterina
always
been
pale
and
thin
lady
assher
was
sure
camomile
tea
would
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
caterina
must
see
if
it
would
and
then
went
dribbling
on
like
a
leaky
until
the
early
entrance
of
the
gentlemen
created
a
diversion
and
she
fastened
on
sir
christopher
who
probably
began
to
think
that
for
poetical
purposes
it
would
be
better
not
to
meet
first
love
again
after
a
lapse
of
forty
years
captain
wybrow
of
course
joined
his
aunt
and
miss
assher
and
gilfil
tried
to
relieve
caterina
from
the
awkwardness
of
sitting
aloof
and
dumb
by
telling
her
how
a
friend
of
his
had
broken
his
arm
and
staked
his
horse
that
morning
not
at
all
appearing
to
heed
that
she
hardly
listened
and
was
looking
towards
the
other
side
of
the
room
one
of
the
tortures
of
jealousy
is
that
it
can
never
turn
its
eyes
away
from
the
thing
that
pains
it
every
one
felt
the
need
of
a
relief
from
sir
christopher
perhaps
the
most
of
all
and
it
was
he
who
made
the
acceptable
proposition
tina
are
we
to
have
no
music
before
we
sit
down
to
cards
your
ladyship
plays
at
cards
i
think
he
added
recollecting
himself
and
turning
to
lady
assher
yes
poor
dear
sir
john
would
have
a
every
night
caterina
sat
down
to
the
harpsichord
at
once
and
had
no
sooner
begun
to
sing
than
she
perceived
with
delight
that
captain
wybrow
was
gliding
towards
the
harpsichord
and
soon
standing
in
the
old
place
this
consciousness
gave
fresh
strength
to
her
voice
and
when
she
noticed
that
miss
assher
presently
followed
him
with
that
air
of
ostentatious
admiration
which
belongs
to
the
absence
of
real
enjoyment
her
closing
was
none
the
worse
for
being
animated
by
a
little
triumphant
contempt
you
are
in
better
voice
than
ever
caterina
said
captain
wybrow
when
she
had
ended
is
rather
different
from
miss
hibbert
small
piping
that
we
used
to
be
glad
of
at
farleigh
is
it
not
beatrice
it
is
you
are
a
most
enviable
creature
miss
sarti
caterina
may
i
not
call
you
caterina
for
i
have
heard
anthony
speak
of
you
so
often
i
seem
to
know
you
quite
well
you
will
let
me
call
you
caterina
yes
every
one
calls
me
caterina
only
when
they
call
me
tina
come
more
singing
more
singing
little
monkey
sir
christopher
called
out
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
have
not
had
half
enough
yet
caterina
was
ready
enough
to
obey
for
while
she
was
singing
she
was
queen
of
the
room
and
miss
assher
was
reduced
to
grimacing
admiration
alas
you
see
what
jealousy
was
doing
in
this
poor
young
soul
caterina
who
had
passed
her
life
as
a
little
unobtrusive
nestling
so
fondly
under
the
wings
that
were
outstretched
for
her
her
heart
beating
only
to
the
peaceful
rhythm
of
love
or
fluttering
with
some
easily
stifled
fear
had
begun
to
know
the
fierce
palpitations
of
triumph
and
hatred
when
the
singing
was
over
sir
christopher
and
lady
cheverel
sat
down
to
whist
with
lady
assher
and
gilfil
and
caterina
placed
herself
at
the
baronet
elbow
as
if
to
watch
the
game
that
she
might
not
appear
to
thrust
herself
on
the
pair
of
lovers
at
first
she
was
glowing
with
her
little
triumph
and
felt
the
strength
of
pride
but
her
eye
steal
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
fireplace
where
captain
wybrow
had
seated
himself
close
to
miss
assher
and
was
leaning
with
his
arm
over
the
back
of
the
chair
in
the
most
position
caterina
began
to
feel
a
choking
sensation
she
could
see
almost
without
looking
that
he
was
taking
up
her
arm
to
examine
her
bracelet
their
heads
were
bending
close
together
her
curls
touching
his
cheek
now
he
was
putting
his
lips
to
her
hand
caterina
felt
her
cheeks
burn
she
could
sit
no
longer
she
got
up
pretended
to
be
gliding
about
in
search
of
something
and
at
length
slipped
out
of
the
room
outside
she
took
a
candle
and
hurrying
along
the
passages
and
up
the
stairs
to
her
own
room
locked
the
door
i
can
not
bear
it
i
can
not
bear
it
the
poor
thing
burst
out
aloud
clasping
her
little
fingers
and
pressing
them
back
against
her
forehead
as
if
she
wanted
to
break
them
then
she
walked
hurriedly
up
and
down
the
room
this
must
go
on
for
days
and
days
and
i
must
see
it
she
looked
about
nervously
for
something
to
clutch
there
was
a
muslin
kerchief
lying
on
the
table
she
took
it
up
and
tore
it
into
shreds
as
she
walked
up
and
down
and
then
pressed
it
into
hard
balls
in
her
hand
anthony
she
thought
can
do
this
without
caring
for
what
i
feel
o
he
can
forget
everything
how
he
used
to
say
he
loved
me
how
he
used
to
take
my
hand
in
his
as
we
walked
how
he
used
to
stand
near
me
in
the
evenings
for
the
sake
of
looking
into
my
eyes
it
is
cruel
it
is
cruel
she
burst
out
again
aloud
as
all
those
in
the
past
returned
upon
her
then
the
tears
gushed
forth
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
by
the
bed
and
sobbed
bitterly
she
did
not
know
how
long
she
had
been
there
till
she
was
startled
by
the
when
thinking
lady
cheverel
might
perhaps
send
some
one
to
inquire
after
her
she
rose
and
began
hastily
to
undress
that
there
might
be
no
possibility
of
her
going
down
again
she
had
hardly
unfastened
her
hair
and
thrown
a
loose
gown
about
her
before
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
sharp
voice
said
tina
my
lady
wants
to
know
if
you
caterina
opened
the
door
and
said
you
dear
sharp
i
have
a
bad
headache
please
tell
my
lady
i
felt
it
come
on
after
singing
goodness
me
why
ar
you
in
bed
istid
o
standing
shivering
there
fit
to
catch
your
death
come
let
me
fasten
up
your
hair
and
tuck
you
up
warm
no
thank
you
i
shall
really
be
in
bed
very
soon
dear
sharpy
do
scold
i
will
be
good
and
get
into
bed
caterina
kissed
her
old
friend
coaxingly
but
sharp
was
not
to
be
over
in
that
way
and
insisted
on
seeing
her
former
charge
in
bed
taking
away
the
candle
which
the
poor
child
had
wanted
to
keep
as
a
companion
but
it
was
impossible
to
lie
there
long
with
that
beating
heart
and
the
little
white
figure
was
soon
out
of
bed
again
seeking
relief
in
the
very
sense
of
chill
and
uncomfort
it
was
light
enough
for
her
to
see
about
her
room
for
the
moon
nearly
at
full
was
riding
high
in
the
heavens
among
scattered
hurrying
clouds
caterina
drew
aside
the
and
sitting
with
her
forehead
pressed
against
the
cold
pane
looked
out
on
the
wide
stretch
of
park
and
lawn
how
dreary
the
moonlight
is
robbed
of
all
its
tenderness
and
repose
by
the
hard
driving
wind
the
trees
are
harassed
by
that
tossing
motion
when
they
would
like
to
be
at
rest
the
shivering
grass
makes
her
quake
with
sympathetic
cold
and
the
willows
by
the
pool
bent
low
and
white
under
that
invisible
harshness
seem
agitated
and
helpless
like
herself
but
she
loves
the
scene
the
better
for
its
sadness
there
is
some
pity
in
it
it
is
not
like
that
hard
unfeeling
happiness
of
lovers
flaunting
in
the
eyes
of
misery
she
set
her
teeth
tight
against
the
and
the
tears
fell
thick
and
fast
she
was
so
thankful
she
could
cry
for
the
mad
passion
she
had
felt
when
her
eyes
were
dry
frightened
her
if
that
dreadful
feeling
were
to
come
on
when
lady
cheverel
was
present
she
should
never
be
able
to
contain
herself
then
there
was
sir
christopher
so
good
to
her
so
happy
about
marriage
and
all
the
while
she
had
these
wicked
feelings
i
can
not
help
it
i
can
not
help
it
she
said
in
a
loud
whisper
between
her
sobs
god
have
pity
upon
me
in
this
way
tina
wore
out
the
long
hours
of
the
windy
till
at
last
with
weary
aching
limbs
she
lay
down
in
bed
again
and
slept
from
mere
exhaustion
while
this
poor
little
heart
was
being
bruised
with
a
weight
too
heavy
for
it
nature
was
holding
on
her
calm
inexorable
way
in
unmoved
and
terrible
beauty
the
stars
were
rushing
in
their
eternal
courses
the
tides
swelled
to
the
level
of
the
last
expectant
weed
the
sun
was
making
brilliant
day
to
busy
nations
on
the
other
side
of
the
swift
earth
the
stream
of
human
thought
and
deed
was
hurrying
and
broadening
onward
the
astronomer
was
at
his
telescope
the
great
ships
were
labouring
over
the
waves
the
toiling
eagerness
of
commerce
the
fierce
spirit
of
revolution
were
only
ebbing
in
brief
rest
and
sleepless
statesmen
were
dreading
the
possible
crisis
of
the
morrow
what
were
our
little
tina
and
her
trouble
in
this
mighty
torrent
rushing
from
one
awful
unknown
to
another
lighter
than
the
smallest
centre
of
quivering
life
in
the
waterdrop
hidden
and
uncared
for
as
the
pulse
of
anguish
in
the
breast
of
the
tiniest
bird
that
has
fluttered
down
to
its
nest
with
the
food
and
has
found
the
nest
torn
and
empty
chapter
the
next
morning
when
caterina
was
waked
from
her
heavy
sleep
by
martha
bringing
in
the
warm
water
the
sun
was
shining
the
wind
had
abated
and
those
hours
of
suffering
in
the
night
seemed
unreal
and
dreamlike
in
spite
of
weary
limbs
and
aching
eyes
she
got
up
and
began
to
dress
with
a
strange
feeling
of
insensibility
as
if
nothing
could
make
her
cry
again
and
she
even
felt
a
sort
of
longing
to
be
in
the
midst
of
company
that
she
might
get
rid
of
this
benumbed
condition
by
contact
there
are
few
of
us
that
are
not
rather
ashamed
of
our
sins
and
follies
as
we
look
out
on
the
blessed
morning
sunlight
which
comes
to
us
like
a
angel
beckoning
us
to
quit
the
old
path
of
vanity
that
stretches
its
dreary
length
behind
us
and
tina
little
as
she
knew
about
doctrines
and
theories
seemed
to
herself
to
have
been
both
foolish
and
wicked
yesterday
today
she
would
try
to
be
good
and
when
she
knelt
down
to
say
her
short
prayer
the
very
form
she
had
learned
by
heart
when
she
was
ten
years
old
she
added
god
help
me
to
bear
it
that
day
the
prayer
seemed
to
be
answered
for
after
some
remarks
on
her
pale
looks
at
breakfast
caterina
passed
the
morning
quietly
miss
assher
and
captain
wybrow
being
out
on
a
riding
excursion
in
the
evening
there
was
a
and
after
caterina
had
sung
a
little
lady
cheverel
remembering
that
she
was
ailing
sent
her
to
bed
where
she
soon
sank
into
a
deep
sleep
body
and
mind
must
renew
their
force
to
suffer
as
well
as
to
enjoy
on
the
morrow
however
it
was
rainy
and
every
one
must
stay
so
it
was
resolved
that
the
guests
should
be
taken
over
the
house
by
sir
christopher
to
hear
the
story
of
the
architectural
alterations
the
family
portraits
and
the
family
relics
all
the
party
except
gilfil
were
in
the
when
the
proposition
was
made
and
when
miss
assher
rose
to
go
she
looked
towards
captain
wybrow
expecting
to
see
him
rise
too
but
he
kept
his
seat
near
the
fire
turning
his
eyes
towards
the
newspaper
which
he
had
been
holding
unread
in
his
hand
you
not
coming
anthony
said
lady
cheverel
noticing
miss
look
of
expectation
think
not
if
you
excuse
me
he
answered
rising
and
opening
the
door
feel
a
little
chilled
this
morning
and
i
am
afraid
of
the
cold
rooms
and
draughts
miss
assher
reddened
but
said
nothing
and
passed
on
lady
cheverel
accompanying
her
caterina
was
seated
at
work
in
the
oriel
window
it
was
the
first
time
she
and
anthony
had
been
alone
together
and
she
had
thought
before
that
he
wished
to
avoid
her
but
now
surely
he
wanted
to
speak
to
her
he
wanted
to
say
something
kind
presently
he
rose
from
his
seat
near
the
fire
and
placed
himself
on
the
ottoman
opposite
to
her
tina
and
how
have
you
been
all
this
long
time
both
the
tone
and
the
words
were
an
offence
to
her
the
tone
was
so
different
from
the
old
one
the
words
were
so
cold
and
unmeaning
she
answered
with
a
little
bitterness
think
you
need
ask
it
does
make
much
difference
to
you
that
the
kindest
thing
you
have
to
say
to
me
after
my
long
absence
do
know
why
you
should
expect
me
to
say
kind
things
captain
wybrow
was
silent
he
wished
very
much
to
avoid
allusions
to
the
past
or
comments
on
the
present
and
yet
he
wished
to
be
well
with
caterina
he
would
have
liked
to
caress
her
make
her
presents
and
have
her
think
him
very
kind
to
her
but
these
women
are
plaguy
perverse
there
no
bringing
them
to
look
rationally
at
anything
at
last
he
said
hoped
you
would
think
all
the
better
of
me
tina
for
doing
as
i
have
done
instead
of
bearing
malice
towards
me
i
hoped
you
would
see
that
it
is
the
best
thing
for
every
one
the
best
for
your
happiness
too
pray
do
make
love
to
miss
assher
for
the
sake
of
my
happiness
answered
tina
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
miss
assher
entered
to
fetch
her
reticule
which
lay
on
the
harpsichord
she
gave
a
keen
glance
at
caterina
whose
face
was
flushed
and
saying
to
captain
wybrow
with
a
slight
sneer
you
are
so
chill
i
wonder
you
like
to
sit
in
the
window
left
the
room
again
immediately
the
lover
did
not
appear
much
discomposed
but
sat
quiet
a
little
longer
and
then
seating
himself
on
the
drew
it
near
to
caterina
and
taking
her
hand
said
tina
look
kindly
at
me
and
let
us
be
friends
i
shall
always
be
your
friend
you
said
caterina
drawing
away
her
hand
are
very
generous
but
pray
move
away
miss
assher
may
come
in
again
assher
be
hanged
said
anthony
feeling
the
fascination
of
old
habit
returning
on
him
in
his
proximity
to
caterina
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
leaned
his
cheek
down
to
hers
the
lips
could
help
meeting
after
that
but
the
next
moment
with
heart
swelling
and
tears
rising
caterina
burst
away
from
him
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
chapter
caterina
tore
herself
from
anthony
with
the
desperate
effort
of
one
who
has
just
enough
left
to
be
conscious
that
the
fumes
of
charcoal
will
master
his
senses
unless
he
bursts
a
way
for
himself
to
the
fresh
air
but
when
she
reached
her
own
room
she
was
still
too
intoxicated
with
that
momentary
revival
of
old
emotions
too
much
agitated
by
the
sudden
return
of
tenderness
in
her
lover
to
know
whether
pain
or
pleasure
predominated
it
was
as
if
a
miracle
had
happened
in
her
little
world
of
feeling
and
made
the
future
all
vague
a
dim
morning
haze
of
possibilities
instead
of
the
sombre
wintry
daylight
and
clear
rigid
outline
of
painful
certainty
she
felt
the
need
of
rapid
movement
she
must
walk
out
in
spite
of
the
rain
happily
there
was
a
thin
place
in
the
curtain
of
clouds
which
seemed
to
promise
that
now
about
noon
the
day
had
a
mind
to
clear
up
caterina
thought
to
herself
will
walk
to
the
mosslands
and
carry
bates
the
comforter
i
have
made
for
him
and
then
lady
cheverel
will
not
wonder
so
much
at
my
going
out
at
the
hall
door
she
found
rupert
the
old
bloodhound
stationed
on
the
mat
with
the
determination
that
the
first
person
who
was
sensible
enough
to
take
a
walk
that
morning
should
have
the
honour
of
his
approbation
and
society
as
he
thrust
his
great
black
and
tawny
head
under
her
hand
and
wagged
his
tail
with
vigorous
eloquence
and
reached
the
climax
of
his
welcome
by
jumping
up
to
lick
her
face
which
was
at
a
convenient
licking
height
for
him
caterina
felt
quite
grateful
to
the
old
dog
for
his
friendliness
animals
are
such
agreeable
friends
they
ask
no
questions
they
pass
no
criticisms
the
was
a
remote
part
of
the
grounds
encircled
by
the
little
stream
issuing
from
the
pool
and
certainly
for
a
wet
day
caterina
could
hardly
have
chosen
a
less
suitable
walk
for
though
the
rain
was
abating
and
presently
ceased
altogether
there
was
still
a
smart
shower
falling
from
the
trees
which
arched
over
the
greater
part
of
her
way
but
she
found
just
the
desired
relief
from
her
feverish
excitement
in
labouring
along
the
wet
paths
with
an
umbrella
that
made
her
arm
ache
this
amount
of
exertion
was
to
her
tiny
body
what
a
day
hunting
often
was
to
gilfil
who
at
times
had
fits
of
jealousy
and
sadness
to
get
rid
of
and
wisely
had
recourse
to
nature
innocent
opium
fatigue
when
caterina
reached
the
pretty
arched
wooden
bridge
which
formed
the
only
entrance
to
the
mosslands
for
any
but
webbed
feet
the
sun
had
mastered
the
clouds
and
was
shining
through
the
boughs
of
the
tall
elms
that
made
a
deep
nest
for
the
gardener
cottage
turning
the
raindrops
into
diamonds
and
inviting
the
nasturtium
flowers
creeping
over
the
porch
and
roof
to
lift
up
their
heads
once
more
the
rooks
were
cawing
with
monotony
apparently
by
a
remarkable
approximation
to
human
intelligence
finding
great
conversational
resources
in
the
change
of
weather
the
mossy
turf
studded
with
the
broad
blades
of
plants
told
that
bates
nest
was
rather
damp
in
the
best
of
weather
but
he
was
of
opinion
that
a
little
external
moisture
would
hurt
no
man
who
was
not
perversely
neglectful
of
that
obvious
and
providential
antidote
caterina
loved
this
nest
every
object
in
it
every
sound
that
haunted
it
had
been
familiar
to
her
from
the
days
when
she
had
been
carried
thither
on
bates
arm
making
little
cawing
noises
to
imitate
the
rooks
clapping
her
hands
at
the
green
frogs
leaping
in
the
moist
grass
and
fixing
grave
eyes
on
the
gardener
fowls
under
their
pens
and
now
the
spot
looked
prettier
to
her
than
ever
it
was
so
out
of
the
way
of
miss
assher
with
her
brilliant
beauty
and
personal
claims
and
small
civil
remarks
she
thought
bates
would
not
be
come
into
his
dinner
yet
so
she
would
sit
down
and
wait
for
him
but
she
was
mistaken
bates
was
seated
in
his
with
his
thrown
over
his
face
as
the
most
eligible
mode
of
passing
away
those
superfluous
hours
between
meals
when
the
weather
drives
a
man
roused
by
the
furious
barking
of
his
chained
bulldog
he
descried
his
little
favourite
approaching
and
forthwith
presented
himself
at
the
doorway
looking
disproportionately
tall
compared
with
the
height
of
his
cottage
the
bulldog
meanwhile
unbent
from
the
severity
of
his
official
demeanour
and
commenced
a
friendly
interchange
of
ideas
with
rupert
bates
hair
was
now
grey
but
his
frame
was
none
the
less
stalwart
and
his
face
looked
all
the
redder
making
an
artistic
contrast
with
the
deep
blue
of
his
cotton
neckerchief
and
of
his
linen
apron
twisted
into
a
girdle
round
his
waist
dang
my
boottons

exclaimed

distance

said
caterina
rather
faintly
feeling
the
sense
of
her
own
insignificance
returning

this
picture
of

something
like
a
painful
contraction
at
her
heart
she
said

will
sir

very
anxious
for

yes
it
is
indeed
said
caterina
hastening
out
and
taking
up
her
umbrella
from
the
kitchen
floor
must
really
go
now
so
she
tripped
off
calling
rupert
while
the
good
gardener
his
hands
thrust
deep
in
his
pockets
stood
looking
after
her
and
shaking
his
head
with
rather
a
melancholy
air
gets
moor
nesh
and
dillicat
than
iver
he
said
half
to
himself
and
half
to
hester
should
woonder
if
she
fades
away
laike
them
cyclamens
as
i
transplanted
she
puts
me
i
maind
on
somehow
on
their
little
thin
stalks
so
whaite
an
tinder
the
poor
little
thing
made
her
way
back
no
longer
hungering
for
the
cold
moist
air
as
a
counteractive
of
inward
excitement
but
with
a
chill
at
her
heart
which
made
the
outward
chill
only
depressing
the
golden
sunlight
beamed
through
the
dripping
boughs
like
a
shechinah
or
visible
divine
presence
and
the
birds
were
chirping
and
trilling
their
new
autumnal
songs
so
sweetly
it
seemed
as
if
their
throats
as
well
as
the
air
were
all
the
clearer
for
the
rain
but
caterina
moved
through
all
this
joy
and
beauty
like
a
poor
wounded
leveret
painfully
dragging
its
little
body
through
the
sweet
for
it
sweet
in
vain
bates
words
about
sir
christopher
joy
miss
assher
beauty
and
the
nearness
of
the
wedding
had
come
upon
her
like
the
pressure
of
a
cold
hand
rousing
her
from
confused
dozing
to
a
perception
of
hard
familiar
realities
it
is
so
with
emotional
natures
whose
thoughts
are
no
more
than
the
fleeting
shadows
cast
by
feeling
to
them
words
are
facts
and
even
when
known
to
be
false
have
a
mastery
over
their
smiles
and
tears
caterina
entered
her
own
room
again
with
no
other
change
from
her
former
state
of
despondency
and
wretchedness
than
an
additional
sense
of
injury
from
anthony
his
behaviour
towards
her
in
the
morning
was
a
new
wrong
to
snatch
a
caress
when
she
justly
claimed
an
expression
of
penitence
of
regret
of
sympathy
was
to
make
more
light
of
her
than
ever
chapter
that
evening
miss
assher
seemed
to
carry
herself
with
unusual
haughtiness
and
was
coldly
observant
of
caterina
there
was
unmistakably
thunder
in
the
air
captain
wybrow
appeared
to
take
the
matter
very
easily
and
was
inclined
to
brave
it
out
by
paying
more
than
ordinary
attention
to
caterina
gilfil
had
induced
her
to
play
a
game
at
draughts
with
him
lady
assher
being
seated
at
picquet
with
sir
christopher
and
miss
assher
in
determined
conversation
with
lady
cheverel
anthony
thus
left
as
an
odd
unit
sauntered
up
to
chair
and
leaned
behind
her
watching
the
game
tina
with
all
the
remembrances
of
the
morning
thick
upon
her
felt
her
cheeks
becoming
more
and
more
crimson
and
at
last
said
impatiently
wish
you
would
go
away
this
happened
directly
under
the
view
of
miss
assher
who
saw
reddening
cheeks
saw
that
she
said
something
impatiently
and
that
captain
wybrow
moved
away
in
consequence
there
was
another
person
too
who
had
noticed
this
incident
with
strong
interest
and
who
was
moreover
aware
that
miss
assher
not
only
saw
but
keenly
observed
what
was
passing
that
other
person
was
gilfil
and
he
drew
some
painful
conclusions
which
heightened
his
anxiety
for
caterina
the
next
morning
in
spite
of
the
fine
weather
miss
assher
declined
riding
and
lady
cheverel
perceiving
that
there
was
something
wrong
between
the
lovers
took
care
that
they
should
be
left
together
in
the
miss
assher
seated
on
the
sofa
near
the
fire
was
busy
with
some
in
which
she
seemed
bent
on
making
great
progress
this
morning
captain
wybrow
sat
opposite
with
a
newspaper
in
his
hand
from
which
he
obligingly
read
extracts
with
an
elaborately
easy
air
wilfully
unconscious
of
the
contemptuous
silence
with
which
she
pursued
her
filigree
work
at
length
he
put
down
the
paper
which
he
could
no
longer
pretend
not
to
have
exhausted
and
miss
assher
then
said
seem
to
be
on
very
intimate
terms
with
miss
sarti
tina
oh
yes
she
has
always
been
the
pet
of
the
house
you
know
we
have
been
quite
brother
and
sister
together
do
generally
colour
so
very
deeply
when
their
brothers
approach
them
she
colour
i
never
noticed
it
but
she
a
timid
little
thing
would
be
much
better
if
you
would
not
be
so
hypocritical
captain
wybrow
i
am
confident
there
has
been
some
flirtation
between
you
miss
sarti
in
her
position
would
never
speak
to
you
with
the
petulance
she
did
last
night
if
you
had
not
given
her
some
kind
of
claim
on
you
dear
beatrice
now
do
be
reasonable
do
ask
yourself
what
earthly
probability
there
is
that
i
should
think
of
flirting
with
poor
little
tina
there
anything
about
her
to
attract
that
sort
of
attention
she
is
more
child
than
woman
one
thinks
of
her
as
a
little
girl
to
be
petted
and
played
with
what
were
you
playing
at
with
her
yesterday
morning
when
i
came
in
unexpectedly
and
her
cheeks
were
flushed
and
her
hands
trembling
morning
o
i
remember
you
know
i
always
tease
her
about
gilfil
who
is
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
her
and
she
is
angry
at
that
perhaps
because
she
likes
him
they
were
old
playfellows
years
before
i
came
here
and
sir
christopher
has
set
his
heart
on
their
marrying
wybrow
you
are
very
false
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
gilfil
that
she
coloured
last
night
when
you
leaned
over
her
chair
you
might
just
as
well
be
candid
if
your
own
mind
is
not
made
up
pray
do
no
violence
to
yourself
i
am
quite
ready
to
give
way
to
miss
superior
attractions
understand
that
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
you
are
perfectly
at
liberty
i
decline
any
share
in
the
affection
of
a
man
who
forfeits
my
respect
by
duplicity
in
saying
this
miss
assher
rose
and
was
sweeping
haughtily
out
of
the
room
when
captain
wybrow
placed
himself
before
her
and
took
her
hand
dear
beatrice
be
patient
do
not
judge
me
so
rashly
sit
down
again
sweet
he
added
in
a
pleading
voice
pressing
both
her
hands
between
his
and
leading
her
back
to
the
sofa
where
he
sat
down
beside
her
miss
assher
was
not
unwilling
to
be
led
back
or
to
listen
but
she
retained
her
cold
and
haughty
expression
you
not
trust
me
beatrice
can
you
not
believe
me
although
there
may
be
things
i
am
unable
to
explain
should
there
be
anything
you
are
unable
to
explain
an
honourable
man
will
not
be
placed
in
circumstances
which
he
can
not
explain
to
the
woman
he
seeks
to
make
his
wife
he
will
not
ask
her
to
that
he
acts
properly
he
will
let
her
that
he
does
so
let
me
go
sir
she
attempted
to
rise
but
he
passed
his
hand
round
her
waist
and
detained
her
beatrice
dear
he
said
imploringly
you
not
understand
that
there
are
things
a
man
does
like
to
talk
about
secrets
that
he
must
keep
for
the
sake
of
others
and
not
for
his
own
sake
everything
that
relates
to
myself
you
may
ask
me
but
do
not
ask
me
to
tell
other
people
secrets
do
you
understand
me
yes
said
miss
assher
scornfully
understand
whenever
you
make
love
to
a
woman
that
is
her
secret
which
you
are
bound
to
keep
for
her
but
it
is
folly
to
be
talking
in
this
way
captain
wybrow
it
is
very
plain
that
there
is
some
relation
more
than
friendship
between
you
and
miss
sarti
since
you
can
not
explain
that
relation
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
between
us
it
beatrice
you
drive
me
mad
can
a
fellow
help
a
falling
in
love
with
him
such
things
are
always
happening
but
men
talk
of
them
these
fancies
will
spring
up
without
the
slightest
foundation
especially
when
a
woman
sees
few
people
they
die
out
again
when
there
is
no
encouragement
if
you
could
like
me
you
ought
not
to
be
surprised
that
other
people
can
you
ought
to
think
the
better
of
them
for
it
mean
to
say
then
that
miss
sarti
is
in
love
with
you
without
your
ever
having
made
love
to
her
not
press
me
to
say
such
things
dearest
it
is
enough
that
you
know
i
love
you
that
i
am
devoted
to
you
you
naughty
queen
you
you
know
there
is
no
chance
for
any
one
else
where
you
are
you
are
only
tormenting
me
to
prove
your
power
over
me
but
do
be
too
cruel
for
you
know
they
say
i
have
another
besides
love
and
these
scenes
bring
on
terrible
palpitations
i
must
have
an
answer
to
this
one
question
said
miss
assher
a
little
softened
there
been
or
is
there
any
love
on
your
side
towards
miss
sarti
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
feelings
but
i
have
a
right
to
know
yours
like
tina
very
much
who
would
not
like
such
a
little
simple
thing
you
would
not
wish
me
not
to
like
her
but
love
that
is
a
very
different
affair
one
has
a
brotherly
affection
for
such
a
woman
as
tina
but
it
is
another
sort
of
woman
that
one
loves
these
last
words
were
made
doubly
significant
by
a
look
of
tenderness
and
a
kiss
imprinted
on
the
hand
captain
wybrow
held
in
his
miss
assher
was
conquered
it
was
so
far
from
probable
that
anthony
should
love
that
pale
insignificant
little
thing
so
highly
probable
that
he
should
adore
the
beautiful
miss
assher
on
the
whole
it
was
rather
gratifying
that
other
women
should
be
languishing
for
her
handsome
lover
he
really
was
an
exquisite
creature
poor
miss
sarti
well
she
would
get
over
it
captain
wybrow
saw
his
advantage
sweet
love
he
continued
us
talk
no
more
about
unpleasant
things
you
will
keep
tina
secret
and
be
very
kind
to
her
wo
you
for
my
sake
but
you
will
ride
out
now
see
what
a
glorious
day
it
is
for
riding
let
me
order
the
horses
terribly
in
want
of
the
air
come
give
me
one
forgiving
kiss
and
say
you
will
go
miss
assher
complied
with
the
double
request
and
then
went
to
equip
herself
for
the
ride
while
her
lover
walked
to
the
stables
chapter
meanwhile
gilfil
who
had
a
heavy
weight
on
his
mind
had
watched
for
the
moment
when
the
two
elder
ladies
having
driven
out
caterina
would
probably
be
alone
in
lady
cheverel
he
went
up
and
knocked
at
the
door
in
said
the
sweet
mellow
voice
always
thrilling
to
him
as
the
sound
of
rippling
water
to
the
thirsty
he
entered
and
found
caterina
standing
in
some
confusion
as
if
she
had
been
startled
from
a
reverie
she
felt
relieved
when
she
saw
it
was
maynard
but
the
next
moment
felt
a
little
pettish
that
he
should
have
come
to
interrupt
and
frighten
her
it
is
you
maynard
do
you
want
lady
cheverel
caterina
he
answered
gravely
want
you
i
have
something
very
particular
to
say
to
you
will
you
let
me
sit
down
with
you
for
half
an
hour
dear
old
preacher
said
caterina
sitting
down
with
an
air
of
weariness
is
it
gilfil
placed
himself
opposite
to
her
and
said
hope
you
will
not
be
hurt
caterina
by
what
i
am
going
to
say
to
you
i
do
not
speak
from
any
other
feelings
than
real
affection
and
anxiety
for
you
i
put
everything
else
out
of
the
question
you
know
you
are
more
to
me
than
all
the
world
but
i
will
not
thrust
before
you
a
feeling
which
you
are
unable
to
return
i
speak
to
you
as
a
brother
the
old
maynard
that
used
to
scold
you
for
getting
your
tangled
ten
years
ago
you
will
not
believe
that
i
have
any
mean
selfish
motive
in
mentioning
things
that
are
painful
to
you
i
know
you
are
very
good
said
caterina
abstractedly
what
i
saw
yesterday
evening
gilfil
went
on
hesitating
and
colouring
slightly
am
led
to
fear
pray
forgive
me
if
i
am
wrong
caterina
that
you
that
captain
wybrow
is
base
enough
still
to
trifle
with
your
feelings
that
he
still
allows
himself
to
behave
to
you
as
no
man
ought
who
is
the
declared
lover
of
another
woman
do
you
mean
maynard
said
caterina
with
anger
flashing
from
her
eyes
you
mean
that
i
let
him
make
love
to
me
what
right
have
you
to
think
that
of
me
what
do
you
mean
that
you
saw
yesterday
evening
not
be
angry
caterina
i
do
suspect
you
of
doing
wrong
i
only
suspect
that
heartless
puppy
of
behaving
so
as
to
keep
awake
feelings
in
you
that
not
only
destroy
your
own
peace
of
mind
but
may
lead
to
very
bad
consequences
with
regard
to
others
i
want
to
warn
you
that
miss
assher
has
her
eyes
open
on
what
passes
between
you
and
captain
wybrow
and
i
feel
sure
she
is
getting
jealous
of
you
pray
be
very
careful
caterina
and
try
to
behave
with
politeness
and
indifference
to
him
you
must
see
by
this
time
that
he
is
not
worth
the
feeling
you
have
given
him
he
more
disturbed
at
his
pulse
beating
one
too
many
in
a
minute
than
at
all
the
misery
he
has
caused
you
by
his
foolish
tritling
ought
not
to
speak
so
of
him
maynard
said
caterina
passionately
is
not
what
you
think
he
care
for
me
he
love
me
only
he
wanted
to
do
what
his
uncle
wished
to
be
sure
i
know
it
is
only
from
the
most
virtuous
motives
that
he
does
what
is
convenient
to
himself
gilfil
paused
he
felt
that
he
was
getting
irritated
and
defeating
his
own
object
presently
he
continued
in
a
calm
and
affectionate
tone
will
say
no
more
about
what
i
think
of
him
caterina
but
whether
he
loved
you
or
not
his
position
now
with
miss
assher
is
such
that
any
love
you
may
cherish
for
him
can
bring
nothing
but
misery
god
knows
i
expect
you
to
leave
off
loving
him
at
a
moment
notice
time
and
absence
and
trying
to
do
what
is
right
are
the
only
cures
if
it
were
not
that
sir
christopher
and
lady
cheverel
would
be
displeased
and
puzzled
at
your
wishing
to
leave
home
just
now
i
would
beg
you
to
pay
a
visit
to
my
sister
she
and
her
husband
are
good
creatures
and
would
make
their
house
a
home
to
you
but
i
could
not
urge
the
thing
just
now
without
giving
a
special
reason
and
what
is
most
of
all
to
be
dreaded
is
the
raising
of
any
suspicion
in
sir
christopher
mind
of
what
has
happened
in
the
past
or
of
your
present
feelings
you
think
so
too
do
you
tina
gilfil
paused
again
but
caterina
said
nothing
she
was
looking
away
from
him
out
of
the
window
and
her
eyes
were
filling
with
tears
he
rose
and
advancing
a
little
towards
her
held
out
his
hand
and
said
me
caterina
for
intruding
on
your
feelings
in
this
way
i
was
so
afraid
you
might
not
be
aware
how
miss
assher
watched
you
remember
i
entreat
you
that
the
peace
of
the
whole
family
depends
on
your
power
of
governing
yourself
only
say
you
forgive
me
before
i
go
good
maynard
she
said
stretching
out
her
little
hand
and
taking
two
of
his
large
fingers
in
her
grasp
while
her
tears
flowed
fast
am
very
cross
to
you
but
my
heart
is
breaking
i
do
know
what
i
do
he
stooped
down
kissed
the
little
hand
and
then
left
the
room
cursed
scoundrel
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
as
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
it
were
not
for
sir
christopher
i
should
like
to
pound
him
into
paste
to
poison
puppies
like
himself
chapter
that
evening
captain
wybrow
returning
from
a
long
ride
with
miss
assher
went
up
to
his
and
seated
himself
with
an
air
of
considerable
lassitude
before
his
mirror
the
reflection
there
presented
of
his
exquisite
self
was
certainly
paler
and
more
worn
than
usual
and
might
excuse
the
anxiety
with
which
he
first
felt
his
pulse
and
then
laid
his
hand
on
his
heart
a
devil
of
a
position
this
for
a
man
to
be
in
was
the
train
of
his
thought
as
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
glass
while
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
crossed
his
hands
behind
his
head
two
jealous
women
and
both
of
them
as
ready
to
take
fire
as
tinder
and
in
my
state
of
health
too
i
should
be
glad
enough
to
run
away
from
the
whole
affair
and
go
off
to
some
place
or
other
where
there
are
no
women
or
only
women
who
are
too
sleepy
to
be
jealous
here
am
i
doing
nothing
to
please
myself
trying
to
do
the
best
thing
for
everybody
else
and
all
the
comfort
i
get
is
to
have
fire
shot
at
me
from
women
eyes
and
venom
spirted
at
me
from
women
tongues
if
beatrice
takes
another
jealous
fit
into
her
head
and
it
likely
enough
tina
is
so
unmanageable
i
do
know
what
storm
she
may
raise
and
any
hitch
in
this
marriage
especially
of
that
sort
might
be
a
fatal
business
for
the
old
gentleman
i
would
have
such
a
blow
fall
upon
him
for
a
great
deal
besides
a
man
must
be
married
some
time
in
his
life
and
i
could
hardly
do
better
than
marry
beatrice
she
an
uncommonly
fine
woman
and
i
really
very
fond
of
her
and
as
i
shall
let
her
have
her
own
way
her
temper
wo
signify
much
i
wish
the
wedding
was
over
and
done
with
for
this
fuss
does
suit
me
at
all
i
have
been
half
so
well
lately
that
scene
about
tina
this
morning
quite
upset
me
poor
little
tina
what
a
little
simpleton
it
was
to
set
her
heart
on
me
in
that
way
but
she
ought
to
see
how
impossible
it
is
that
things
should
be
different
if
she
would
but
understand
how
kindly
i
feel
towards
her
and
make
up
her
mind
to
look
on
me
as
a
friend
but
that
it
what
one
never
can
get
a
woman
to
do
beatrice
is
very
i
sure
she
would
be
kind
to
the
little
thing
it
would
be
a
great
comfort
if
tina
would
take
to
gilfil
if
it
were
only
in
anger
against
me
he
make
her
a
capital
husband
and
i
should
like
to
see
the
little
happy
if
i
had
been
in
a
different
position
i
would
certainly
have
married
her
myself
hut
that
was
out
of
the
question
with
my
responsibilities
to
sir
christopher
i
think
a
little
persuasion
from
my
uncle
would
bring
her
to
accept
gilfil
i
know
she
would
never
be
able
to
oppose
my
uncle
wishes
and
if
they
were
once
married
she
such
a
loving
little
thing
she
would
soon
be
billing
and
cooing
with
him
as
if
she
had
never
known
me
it
would
certainly
be
the
best
thing
for
her
happiness
if
that
marriage
were
hastened
heigho
those
are
lucky
fellows
that
have
no
women
falling
in
love
with
them
it
a
confounded
responsibility
at
this
point
in
his
meditations
he
turned
his
head
a
little
so
as
to
get
a
view
of
his
face
clearly
it
was
the
infelice
della
that
laid
these
onerous
duties
upon
him
an
idea
which
naturally
suggested
that
he
should
ring
for
his
valet
for
the
next
few
days
however
there
was
such
a
cessation
of
threatening
symptoms
as
to
allay
the
anxiety
both
of
captain
wybrow
and
gilfil
all
earthly
things
have
their
lull
even
on
nights
when
the
most
unappeasable
wind
is
raging
there
will
be
a
moment
of
stillness
before
it
crashes
among
the
boughs
again
and
storms
against
the
windows
and
howls
like
a
thousand
lost
demons
through
the
keyholes
miss
assher
appeared
to
be
in
the
highest
captain
wybrow
was
more
assiduous
than
usual
and
was
very
circumspect
in
his
behaviour
to
caterina
on
whom
miss
assher
bestowed
unwonted
attentions
the
weather
was
brilliant
there
were
riding
excursions
in
the
mornings
and
in
the
evenings
consultations
in
the
library
between
sir
christopher
and
lady
assher
seemed
to
be
leading
to
a
satisfactory
result
and
it
was
understood
that
this
visit
at
cheverel
manor
would
terminate
in
another
fortnight
when
the
preparations
for
the
wedding
would
be
carried
forward
with
all
despatch
at
farleigh
the
baronet
seemed
every
day
more
radiant
accustomed
to
view
people
who
entered
into
his
plans
by
the
pleasant
light
which
his
own
strong
will
and
bright
hopefulness
were
always
casting
on
the
future
he
saw
nothing
hut
personal
charms
and
promising
domestic
qualities
in
miss
assher
whose
quickness
of
eye
and
taste
in
externals
formed
a
real
ground
of
sympathy
between
her
and
sir
christopher
lady
cheverel
enthusiasm
never
rose
above
the
temperate
mark
of
calm
satisfaction
and
having
quite
her
share
of
the
critical
acumen
which
characterizes
the
mutual
estimates
of
the
fair
sex
she
had
a
more
moderate
opinion
of
miss
assher
qualities
she
suspected
that
the
fair
beatrice
had
a
sharp
and
imperious
temper
and
being
herself
on
principle
and
by
habitual
the
most
deferential
of
wives
she
noticed
with
disapproval
miss
occasional
air
of
authority
towards
captain
wybrow
a
proud
woman
who
has
learned
to
submit
carries
all
her
pride
to
the
reinforcement
of
her
submission
and
looks
down
with
severe
superiority
on
all
feminine
assumption
as
lady
cheverel
however
confined
her
criticisms
to
the
privacy
of
her
own
thoughts
and
with
a
reticence
which
i
fear
may
seem
incredible
did
not
use
them
as
a
means
of
disturbing
her
husband
complacency
and
caterina
how
did
she
pass
these
sunny
autumn
days
in
which
the
skies
seemed
to
be
smiling
on
the
family
gladness
to
her
the
change
in
miss
assher
manner
was
unaccountable
those
compassionate
attentions
those
smiling
condescensions
were
torture
to
caterina
who
was
constantly
tempted
to
repulse
them
with
anger
she
thought
anthony
has
told
her
to
be
kind
to
poor
tina
this
was
an
insult
he
ought
to
have
known
that
the
mere
presence
of
miss
assher
was
painful
to
her
that
miss
assher
smiles
scorched
her
that
miss
assher
kind
words
were
like
poison
stings
inflaming
her
to
madness
and
he
anthony
he
was
evidently
repenting
of
the
tenderness
he
had
been
betrayed
into
that
morning
in
the
he
was
cold
and
distant
and
civil
to
her
to
ward
off
beatrice
suspicions
and
beatrice
could
be
so
gracious
now
because
she
was
sure
of
anthony
entire
devotion
well
and
so
it
ought
to
be
and
she
ought
not
to
wish
it
otherwise
and
yet
oh
he
cruel
to
her
she
could
never
have
behaved
so
to
him
to
make
her
love
him
so
to
speak
such
tender
words
to
give
her
such
caresses
and
then
to
behave
as
if
such
things
had
never
been
he
had
given
her
the
poison
that
seemed
so
sweet
while
she
was
drinking
it
and
now
it
was
in
her
blood
and
she
was
helpless
with
this
tempest
pent
up
in
her
bosom
the
poor
child
went
up
to
her
room
every
night
and
there
it
all
burst
forth
there
with
loud
whispers
and
sobs
restlessly
pacing
up
and
down
lying
on
the
hard
floor
courting
cold
and
weariness
she
told
to
the
pitiful
listening
night
the
anguish
which
she
could
pour
into
no
mortal
ear
but
always
sleep
came
at
last
and
always
in
the
morning
the
reactive
calm
that
enabled
her
to
live
through
the
day
it
is
amazing
how
long
a
young
frame
will
go
on
battling
with
this
sort
of
secret
wretchedness
and
yet
show
no
traces
of
the
conflict
for
any
but
sympathetic
eyes
the
very
delicacy
of
caterina
usual
appearance
her
natural
paleness
and
habitually
quiet
ways
made
any
symptoms
of
fatigue
and
suffering
less
noticeable
and
her
singing
the
one
thing
in
which
she
ceased
to
be
passive
and
became
prominent
lost
none
of
its
energy
she
herself
sometimes
wondered
how
it
was
that
whether
she
felt
sad
or
angry
crushed
with
the
sense
of
indifference
or
burning
with
impatience
under
miss
assher
attentions
it
was
always
a
relief
to
her
to
sing
those
full
deep
notes
she
sent
forth
seemed
to
be
lifting
the
pain
from
her
heart
seemed
to
be
carrying
away
the
madness
from
her
brain
thus
lady
cheverel
noticed
no
change
in
caterina
and
it
was
only
gilfil
who
discerned
with
anxiety
the
feverish
spot
that
sometimes
rose
on
her
cheek
the
deepening
violet
tint
under
her
eyes
and
the
strange
absent
glance
the
unhealthy
glitter
of
the
beautiful
eyes
themselves
but
those
agitated
nights
were
producing
a
more
fatal
effect
than
was
represented
by
these
slight
outward
changes
chapter
the
following
sunday
the
morning
being
rainy
it
was
determined
that
the
family
should
not
go
to
cumbermoor
church
as
usual
but
that
gilfil
who
had
only
an
afternoon
service
at
his
curacy
should
conduct
the
morning
service
in
the
chapel
just
before
the
appointed
hour
of
eleven
caterina
came
down
into
the
looking
so
unusually
ill
as
to
call
forth
an
anxious
inquiry
from
lady
cheverel
who
on
learning
that
she
had
a
severe
headache
insisted
that
she
should
not
attend
service
and
at
once
packed
her
up
comfortably
on
a
sofa
near
the
fire
putting
a
volume
of
tillotson
sermons
into
her
hands
as
appropriate
reading
if
caterina
should
feel
equal
to
that
means
of
edification
excellent
medicine
for
the
mind
are
the
good
archbishop
sermons
but
a
medicine
unhappily
not
suited
to
tina
case
she
sat
with
the
book
open
on
her
knees
her
dark
eyes
fixed
vacantly
on
the
portrait
of
that
handsome
lady
cheverel
wife
of
the
notable
sir
anthony
she
gazed
at
the
picture
without
thinking
of
it
and
the
fair
blonde
dame
seemed
to
look
down
on
her
with
that
benignant
unconcern
that
mild
wonder
with
which
happy
women
are
apt
to
look
down
on
their
agitated
and
weaker
sisters
caterina
was
thinking
of
the
near
future
of
the
wedding
that
was
so
soon
to
come
of
all
she
would
have
to
live
through
in
the
next
months
wish
i
could
be
very
ill
and
die
before
then
she
thought
people
get
very
ill
they
do
mind
about
things
poor
patty
richards
looked
so
happy
when
she
was
in
a
decline
she
did
seem
to
care
any
more
about
her
lover
that
she
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
and
she
liked
the
smell
of
the
flowers
so
that
i
used
to
take
her
o
if
i
could
but
like
anything
if
i
could
but
think
about
anything
else
if
these
dreadful
feelings
would
go
away
i
would
mind
about
not
being
happy
i
would
want
anything
and
i
could
do
what
would
please
sir
christopher
and
lady
cheverel
but
when
that
rage
and
anger
comes
into
me
i
know
what
to
do
i
do
feel
the
ground
under
me
i
only
feel
my
head
and
heart
beating
and
it
seems
as
if
i
must
do
something
dreadful
o
i
wonder
if
any
one
ever
felt
like
me
before
i
must
be
very
wicked
but
god
will
have
pity
on
me
he
knows
all
i
have
to
bear
in
this
way
the
time
wore
on
till
tina
heard
the
sound
of
voices
along
the
passage
and
became
conscious
that
the
volume
of
tillotson
had
slipped
on
the
floor
she
had
only
just
picked
it
up
and
seen
with
alarm
that
the
pages
were
bent
when
lady
assher
beatrice
and
captain
wybrow
entered
all
with
that
brisk
and
cheerful
air
which
a
sermon
is
often
observed
to
produce
when
it
is
quite
finished
lady
assher
at
once
came
and
seated
herself
by
caterina
her
ladyship
had
been
considerably
refreshed
by
a
doze
and
was
in
great
force
for
monologue
my
dear
miss
sarti
and
how
do
you
feel
now
a
little
better
i
see
i
thought
you
would
be
sitting
quietly
here
these
headaches
now
are
all
from
weakness
you
must
not
yourself
and
you
must
take
bitters
i
used
to
have
just
the
same
sort
of
headaches
when
i
was
your
age
and
old
dr
samson
used
to
say
to
my
mother
madam
what
your
daughter
suffers
from
is
weakness
he
was
such
a
curious
old
man
was
dr
samson
but
i
wish
you
could
have
heard
the
sermon
this
morning
such
an
excellent
sermon
it
was
about
the
ten
virgins
five
of
them
were
foolish
and
five
were
clever
you
know
and
gilfil
explained
all
that
what
a
very
pleasant
young
man
he
is
so
very
quiet
and
agreeable
and
such
a
good
hand
at
whist
i
wish
we
had
him
at
farleigh
sir
john
would
have
liked
him
beyond
anything
he
is
so
at
cards
and
he
was
such
a
man
for
cards
was
sir
john
and
our
rector
is
a
very
irritable
man
he
ca
bear
to
lose
his
money
at
cards
i
do
think
a
clergyman
ought
to
mind
about
losing
his
money
do
you
do
you
now
pray
lady
assher
interposed
beatrice
in
her
usual
tone
of
superiority
not
weary
poor
caterina
with
such
uninteresting
questions
your
head
seems
very
bad
still
dear
she
continued
in
a
condoling
tone
to
caterina
take
my
vinaigrette
and
keep
it
in
your
pocket
it
will
perhaps
refresh
you
now
and
then
thank
you
answered
caterina
will
not
take
it
away
from
you
dear
i
never
use
it
you
must
take
it
miss
assher
persisted
holding
it
close
to
tina
hand
tina
coloured
deeply
pushed
the
vinaigrette
away
with
some
impatience
and
said
you
i
never
use
those
things
i
do
like
vinaigrettes
miss
assher
returned
the
vinaigrette
to
her
pocket
in
surprise
and
haughty
silence
and
captain
wybrow
who
had
looked
on
in
some
alarm
said
hastily
it
is
quite
bright
out
of
doors
now
there
is
time
for
a
walk
before
luncheon
come
beatrice
put
on
your
hat
and
cloak
and
let
us
have
half
an
hour
walk
on
the
gravel
do
my
dear
said
lady
assher
i
will
go
and
see
if
sir
christopher
is
having
his
walk
in
the
gallery
as
soon
as
the
door
had
closed
behind
the
two
ladies
captain
wybrow
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
turned
towards
caterina
and
said
in
a
tone
of
earnest
remonstrance
dear
caterina
let
me
beg
of
you
to
exercise
more
control
over
your
feelings
you
are
really
rude
to
miss
assher
and
i
can
see
that
she
is
quite
hurt
consider
how
strange
your
behaviour
must
appear
to
her
she
will
wonder
what
can
be
the
cause
of
it
come
dear
tina
he
added
approaching
her
and
attempting
to
take
her
hand
your
own
sake
let
me
entreat
you
to
receive
her
attentions
politely
she
really
feels
very
kindly
towards
you
and
i
should
be
so
happy
to
see
you
friends
caterina
was
already
in
such
a
state
of
diseased
susceptibility
that
the
most
innocent
words
from
captain
wybrow
would
have
been
irritating
to
her
as
the
whirr
of
the
most
delicate
wing
will
afflict
a
nervous
patient
but
this
tone
of
benevolent
remonstrance
was
intolerable
he
had
inflicted
a
great
and
unrepented
injury
on
her
and
now
he
assumed
an
air
of
benevolence
towards
her
this
was
a
new
outrage
his
profession
of
goodwill
was
insolence
caterina
snatched
away
her
hand
and
said
indignantly
me
to
myself
captain
wybrow
i
do
not
disturb
you
why
will
you
be
so
violent
so
unjust
to
me
it
is
for
you
that
i
feel
anxious
miss
assher
has
already
noticed
how
strange
your
behaviour
is
both
to
her
and
me
and
it
puts
me
into
a
very
difficult
position
what
can
i
say
to
her
caterina
burst
forth
with
intense
bitterness
rising
and
moving
towards
the
door
that
i
am
a
poor
silly
girl
and
have
fallen
in
love
with
you
and
am
jealous
of
her
but
that
you
have
never
had
any
feeling
but
pity
for
me
you
have
never
behaved
with
anything
more
than
friendliness
to
me
tell
her
that
and
she
will
think
all
the
better
of
you
tina
uttered
this
as
the
bitterest
sarcasm
her
ideas
would
furnish
her
with
not
having
the
faintest
suspicion
that
the
sarcasm
derived
any
of
its
bitterness
from
truth
underneath
all
her
sense
of
wrong
which
was
rather
instinctive
than
reflective
underneath
all
the
madness
of
her
jealousy
and
her
ungovernable
impulses
of
resentment
and
vindictiveness
underneath
all
this
scorching
passion
there
were
still
left
some
hidden
crystal
dews
of
trust
of
of
belief
that
anthony
was
trying
to
do
the
right
love
had
not
all
gone
to
feed
the
fires
of
hatred
tina
still
trusted
that
anthony
felt
more
for
her
than
he
seemed
to
feel
she
was
still
far
from
suspecting
him
of
a
wrong
which
a
woman
resents
even
more
than
inconstancy
and
she
threw
out
this
taunt
simply
as
the
most
intense
expression
she
could
find
for
the
anger
of
the
moment
as
she
stood
nearly
in
the
middle
of
the
room
her
little
body
trembling
under
the
shock
of
passions
too
strong
for
it
her
very
lips
pale
and
her
eyes
gleaming
the
door
opened
and
miss
assher
appeared
tall
blooming
and
splendid
in
her
walking
costume
as
she
entered
her
face
wore
the
smile
appropriate
to
the
exits
and
entrances
of
a
young
lady
who
feels
that
her
presence
is
an
interesting
fact
but
the
next
moment
she
looked
at
caterina
with
grave
surprise
and
then
threw
a
glance
of
angry
suspicion
at
captain
wybrow
who
wore
an
air
of
weariness
and
vexation
you
are
too
much
engaged
to
walk
out
captain
wybrow
i
will
go
alone
no
i
am
coming
he
answered
hurrying
towards
her
and
leading
her
out
of
the
room
leaving
poor
caterina
to
feel
all
the
reaction
of
shame
and
after
her
outburst
of
passion
chapter
what
is
likely
to
be
the
next
scene
in
the
drama
between
you
and
miss
sarti
said
miss
assher
to
captain
wybrow
as
soon
as
they
were
out
on
the
gravel
would
be
agreeable
to
have
some
idea
of
what
is
coming
captain
wybrow
was
silent
he
felt
out
of
humour
wearied
annoyed
there
come
moments
when
one
almost
determines
never
again
to
oppose
anything
but
dead
silence
to
an
angry
woman
then
confound
it
he
said
to
himself
going
to
be
battered
on
the
other
flank
he
looked
resolutely
at
the
horizon
with
something
more
like
a
frown
on
his
face
than
beatrice
had
ever
seen
there
after
a
pause
of
two
or
three
minutes
she
continued
in
a
still
haughtier
tone
suppose
you
are
aware
captain
wybrow
that
i
expect
an
explanation
of
what
i
have
just
seen
have
no
explanation
my
dear
beatrice
he
answered
at
last
making
a
strong
effort
over
himself
what
i
have
already
given
you
i
hoped
you
would
never
recur
to
the
subject
explanation
however
is
very
far
from
satisfactory
i
can
only
say
that
the
airs
miss
sarti
thinks
herself
entitled
to
put
on
towards
you
are
quite
incompatible
with
your
position
as
regards
me
and
her
behaviour
to
me
is
most
insulting
i
shall
certainly
not
stay
in
the
house
under
such
circumstances
and
mamma
must
state
the
reasons
to
sir
christopher
said
captain
wybrow
his
irritation
giving
way
to
alarm
beseech
you
to
be
patient
and
exercise
your
good
feelings
in
this
affair
it
is
very
painful
i
know
but
i
am
sure
you
would
be
grieved
to
injure
poor
caterina
to
bring
down
my
uncle
anger
upon
her
consider
what
a
poor
little
dependent
thing
she
is
is
very
adroit
of
you
to
make
these
evasions
but
do
not
suppose
that
they
deceive
me
miss
sarti
would
never
dare
to
behave
to
you
as
she
does
if
you
had
not
flirted
with
her
or
made
love
to
her
i
suppose
she
considers
your
engagement
to
me
a
breach
of
faith
to
her
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
certainly
for
making
me
miss
sarti
rival
you
have
told
me
a
falsehood
captain
wybrow
i
solemnly
declare
to
you
that
caterina
is
nothing
more
to
me
than
a
girl
i
naturally
feel
kindly
to
as
a
favourite
of
my
uncle
and
a
nice
little
thing
enough
i
should
be
glad
to
see
her
married
to
gilfil
that
a
good
proof
that
i
not
in
love
with
her
i
should
think
as
to
the
past
i
may
have
shown
her
little
attentions
which
she
has
exaggerated
and
misinterpreted
what
man
is
not
liable
to
that
sort
of
thing
what
can
she
found
her
behaviour
on
what
had
she
been
saying
to
you
this
morning
to
make
her
tremble
and
turn
pale
in
that
way
i
do
know
i
just
said
something
about
her
behaving
peevishly
with
that
italian
blood
of
hers
there
no
knowing
how
she
may
take
what
one
says
she
a
fierce
little
thing
though
she
seems
so
quiet
generally
she
ought
to
be
made
to
know
how
unbecoming
and
indelicate
her
conduct
is
for
my
part
i
wonder
lady
cheverel
has
not
noticed
her
short
answers
and
the
airs
she
puts
on
me
beg
of
you
beatrice
not
to
hint
anything
of
the
kind
to
lady
cheverel
you
must
have
observed
how
strict
my
aunt
is
it
never
enters
her
head
that
a
girl
can
be
in
love
with
a
man
who
has
not
made
her
an
offer
i
shall
let
miss
sarti
know
myself
that
i
have
observed
her
conduct
it
will
be
only
a
charity
to
her
dear
that
will
be
doing
nothing
but
harm
caterina
temper
is
peculiar
the
best
thing
you
can
do
will
be
to
leave
her
to
herself
as
much
as
possible
it
will
all
wear
off
i
no
doubt
she
be
married
to
gilfil
before
long
girls
fancies
are
easily
diverted
from
one
object
to
another
by
jove
what
a
rate
my
heart
is
galloping
at
these
confounded
palpitations
get
worse
instead
of
better
thus
ended
the
conversation
so
far
as
it
concerned
caterina
not
without
leaving
a
distinct
resolution
in
captain
wybrow
mind
a
resolution
carried
into
effect
the
next
day
when
he
was
in
the
library
with
sir
christopher
for
the
purpose
of
discussing
some
arrangements
about
the
approaching
marriage
the
by
he
said
carelessly
when
the
business
came
to
a
pause
and
he
was
sauntering
round
the
room
with
his
hands
in
his
surveying
the
backs
of
the
books
that
lined
the
walls
is
the
wedding
between
gilfil
and
caterina
to
come
off
sir
i
a
for
a
poor
devil
so
many
fathoms
deep
in
love
as
maynard
why
should
their
marriage
happen
as
soon
as
ours
i
suppose
he
has
come
to
an
understanding
with
tina
said
sir
christopher
did
think
of
letting
the
thing
be
until
old
crichley
died
he
ca
hold
out
very
long
poor
fellow
and
then
maynard
might
have
entered
into
matrimony
and
the
rectory
both
at
once
but
after
all
that
really
is
no
good
reason
for
waiting
there
is
no
need
for
them
to
leave
the
manor
when
they
are
married
the
little
monkey
is
quite
old
enough
it
would
be
pretty
to
see
her
a
matron
with
a
baby
about
the
size
of
a
kitten
in
her
arms
think
that
system
of
waiting
is
always
bad
and
if
i
can
further
any
settlement
you
would
like
to
make
on
caterina
i
shall
be
delighted
to
carry
out
your
wishes
dear
boy
that
very
good
of
you
but
maynard
will
have
enough
and
from
what
i
know
of
him
and
i
know
him
well
i
think
he
would
rather
provide
for
caterina
himself
however
now
you
have
put
this
matter
into
my
head
i
begin
to
blame
myself
for
not
having
thought
of
it
before
i
been
so
wrapt
up
in
beatrice
and
you
you
rascal
that
i
had
really
forgotten
poor
maynard
and
he
older
than
you
it
high
time
he
was
settled
in
life
as
a
family
man
sir
christopher
paused
took
snuff
in
a
meditative
manner
and
presently
said
more
to
himself
than
to
anthony
who
was
humming
a
tune
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
yes
it
will
be
a
capital
plan
to
finish
off
all
our
family
business
at
once
riding
out
with
miss
assher
the
same
morning
captain
wybrow
mentioned
to
her
incidentally
that
sir
christopher
was
anxious
to
bring
about
the
wedding
between
gilfil
and
caterina
as
soon
as
possible
and
that
he
for
his
part
should
do
all
he
could
to
further
the
affair
it
would
be
the
best
thing
in
the
world
for
tina
in
whose
welfare
he
was
really
interested
with
sir
christopher
there
was
never
any
long
interval
between
purpose
and
execution
he
made
up
his
mind
promptly
and
he
acted
promptly
on
rising
from
luncheon
he
said
to
gilfil
with
me
into
the
library
maynard
i
want
to
have
a
word
with
you
my
boy
he
began
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
tapping
his
and
looking
radiant
at
the
idea
of
the
unexpected
pleasure
he
was
about
to
give
should
we
have
two
happy
couples
instead
of
one
before
the
autumn
is
over
eh
he
repeated
after
a
moment
pause
lengthening
out
the
monosyllable
taking
a
slow
pinch
and
looking
up
at
maynard
with
a
sly
smile
not
quite
sure
that
i
understand
you
sir
answered
gilfil
who
felt
annoyed
at
the
consciousness
that
he
was
turning
pale
understand
me
you
rogue
you
know
very
well
whose
happiness
lies
nearest
to
my
heart
after
anthony
you
know
you
let
me
into
your
secrets
long
ago
so
there
no
confession
to
make
tina
quite
old
enough
to
be
a
grave
little
wife
now
and
though
the
rectory
not
ready
for
you
that
no
matter
my
lady
and
i
shall
feel
all
the
more
comfortable
for
having
you
with
us
we
should
miss
our
little
if
we
lost
her
all
at
once
gilfil
felt
himself
in
a
painfully
difficult
position
he
dreaded
that
sir
christopher
should
surmise
or
discover
the
true
state
of
caterina
feelings
and
yet
he
was
obliged
to
make
those
feelings
the
ground
of
his
reply
dear
sir
he
at
last
said
with
some
effort
will
not
suppose
that
i
am
not
alive
to
your
goodness
that
i
am
not
grateful
for
your
fatherly
interest
in
my
happiness
but
i
fear
that
caterina
feelings
towards
me
are
not
such
as
to
warrant
the
hope
that
she
would
accept
a
proposal
of
marriage
from
me
you
ever
asked
her
sir
but
we
often
know
these
things
too
well
without
asking
pooh
the
little
monkey
love
you
why
you
were
her
first
playfellow
and
i
remember
she
used
to
cry
if
you
cut
your
finger
besides
she
has
always
silently
admitted
that
you
were
her
lover
you
know
i
have
always
spoken
of
you
to
her
in
that
light
i
took
it
for
granted
you
had
settled
the
business
between
yourselves
so
did
anthony
anthony
thinks
she
in
love
with
you
and
he
has
young
eyes
which
are
apt
enough
to
see
clearly
in
these
matters
he
was
talking
to
me
about
it
this
morning
and
pleased
me
very
much
by
the
friendly
interest
he
showed
in
you
and
tina
the
blood
more
than
was
wanted
rushed
back
to
gilfil
face
he
set
his
teeth
and
clenched
his
hands
in
the
effort
to
repress
a
burst
of
indignation
sir
christopher
noticed
the
flush
but
thought
it
indicated
the
fluctuation
of
hope
and
fear
about
caterina
he
went
on
too
modest
by
half
maynard
a
fellow
who
can
take
a
gate
as
you
can
ought
not
to
be
so
if
you
ca
speak
to
her
yourself
leave
me
to
talk
to
her
christopher
said
poor
maynard
earnestly
shall
really
feel
it
the
greatest
kindness
you
can
possibly
show
me
not
to
mention
this
subject
to
caterina
at
present
i
think
such
a
proposal
made
prematurely
might
only
alienate
her
from
me
sir
christopher
was
getting
a
little
displeased
at
this
contradiction
his
tone
became
a
little
sharper
as
he
said
you
any
grounds
to
state
for
this
opinion
beyond
your
general
notion
that
tina
is
not
enough
in
love
with
you
can
state
none
beyond
my
own
very
strong
impression
that
she
does
not
love
me
well
enough
to
marry
me
i
think
that
ground
is
worth
nothing
at
all
i
am
tolerably
correct
in
my
judgement
of
people
and
if
i
am
not
very
much
deceived
in
tina
she
looks
forward
to
nothing
else
but
to
your
being
her
husband
leave
me
to
manage
the
matter
as
i
think
best
you
may
rely
on
me
that
i
shall
do
no
harm
to
your
cause
maynard
gilfil
afraid
to
say
more
yet
wretched
in
the
prospect
of
what
might
result
from
sir
christopher
determination
quitted
the
library
in
a
state
of
mingled
indignation
against
captain
wybrow
and
distress
for
himself
and
caterina
what
would
she
think
of
him
she
might
suppose
that
had
instigated
or
sanctioned
sir
christopher
proceeding
he
should
perhaps
not
have
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
on
the
subject
in
time
he
would
write
her
a
note
and
carry
it
up
to
her
room
after
the
had
rung
no
that
would
agitate
her
and
unfit
her
for
appearing
at
dinner
and
passing
the
evening
calmly
he
would
defer
it
till
after
prayers
he
contrived
to
lead
her
back
to
the
and
to
put
a
letter
in
her
hand
she
carried
it
up
to
her
own
room
wondering
and
there
read
caterina
do
not
suspect
for
a
moment
that
anything
sir
christopher
may
say
to
you
about
our
marriage
has
been
prompted
by
me
i
have
done
all
i
dare
do
to
dissuade
him
from
urging
the
subject
and
have
only
been
prevented
from
speaking
more
strongly
by
the
dread
of
provoking
questions
which
i
could
not
answer
without
causing
you
fresh
misery
i
write
this
both
to
prepare
you
for
anything
sir
christopher
may
say
and
to
assure
you
but
i
hope
you
already
believe
it
that
your
feelings
are
sacred
to
me
i
would
rather
part
with
the
dearest
hope
of
my
life
than
be
the
means
of
adding
to
your
trouble
is
captain
wybrow
who
has
prompted
sir
christopher
to
take
up
the
subject
at
this
moment
i
tell
you
this
to
save
you
from
hearing
it
suddenly
when
you
are
with
sir
christopher
you
see
now
what
sort
of
stuff
that
dastard
heart
is
made
of
trust
in
me
always
dearest
caterina
as
whatever
may
come
your
faithful
friend
and
brother
gilfil
caterina
was
at
first
too
terribly
stung
by
the
words
about
captain
wybrow
to
think
of
the
difficulty
which
threatened
her
to
think
either
of
what
sir
christopher
would
say
to
her
or
of
what
she
could
say
in
reply
bitter
sense
of
injury
fierce
resentment
left
no
room
for
fear
with
the
poisoned
garment
upon
him
the
victim
writhes
under
the
torture
he
has
no
thought
of
the
coming
death
anthony
could
do
this
of
this
there
could
be
no
explanation
but
the
coolest
contempt
for
her
feelings
the
basest
sacrifice
of
all
the
consideration
and
tenderness
he
owed
her
to
the
ease
of
his
position
with
miss
assher
no
it
was
worse
than
that
it
was
deliberate
gratuitous
cruelty
he
wanted
to
show
her
how
he
despised
her
he
wanted
to
make
her
feel
her
folly
in
having
ever
believed
that
he
loved
her
the
last
crystal
drops
of
trust
and
tenderness
she
thought
were
dried
up
all
was
parched
fiery
hatred
now
she
need
no
longer
check
her
resentment
by
the
fear
of
doing
him
an
injustice
he
trifled
with
her
as
maynard
had
said
he
been
reckless
of
her
and
now
he
was
base
and
cruel
she
had
cause
enough
for
her
bitterness
and
anger
they
were
not
so
wicked
as
they
had
seemed
to
her
as
these
thoughts
were
hurrying
after
each
other
like
so
many
sharp
throbs
of
fevered
pain
she
shed
no
tear
she
paced
restlessly
to
and
fro
as
her
habit
was
her
hands
clenched
her
eyes
gleaming
fiercely
and
wandering
uneasily
as
if
in
search
of
something
on
which
she
might
throw
herself
like
a
tigress
i
could
speak
to
him
she
whispered
tell
him
i
hate
him
i
despise
him
i
loathe
him
suddenly
as
if
a
new
thought
had
struck
her
she
drew
a
key
from
her
pocket
and
unlocking
an
inlaid
desk
where
she
stored
up
her
keepsakes
took
from
it
a
small
miniature
it
was
in
a
very
slight
gold
frame
with
a
ring
to
it
as
if
intended
to
be
worn
on
a
chain
and
under
the
glass
at
the
back
were
two
locks
of
hair
one
dark
and
the
other
auburn
arranged
in
a
fantastic
knot
it
was
anthony
secret
present
to
her
a
year
ago
a
copy
he
had
had
made
specially
for
her
for
the
last
month
she
had
not
taken
it
from
its
there
was
no
need
to
heighten
the
vividness
of
the
past
but
now
she
clutched
it
fiercely
and
dashed
it
across
the
room
against
the
bare
will
she
crush
it
under
her
feet
and
grind
it
under
her
shoe
till
every
trace
of
those
false
cruel
features
is
gone
ah
no
she
rushed
across
the
room
but
when
she
saw
the
little
treasure
she
had
cherished
so
fondly
so
often
smothered
with
kisses
so
often
laid
under
her
pillow
and
remembered
with
the
first
return
of
consciousness
in
the
morning
when
she
saw
this
one
visible
relic
of
the
too
happy
past
lying
with
the
glass
shivered
the
hair
fallen
out
the
thin
ivory
cracked
there
was
a
revulsion
of
the
overstrained
feeling
relenting
came
and
she
burst
into
tears
look
at
her
stooping
down
to
gather
up
her
treasure
searching
for
the
hair
and
replacing
it
and
then
mournfully
examining
the
crack
that
disfigures
the
image
alas
there
is
no
glass
now
to
guard
either
the
hair
or
the
portrait
but
see
how
carefully
she
wraps
delicate
paper
round
it
and
locks
it
up
again
in
its
old
place
poor
child
god
send
the
relenting
may
always
come
before
the
worst
irrevocable
deed
this
action
had
quieted
her
and
she
sat
down
to
read
maynard
letter
again
she
read
it
two
or
three
times
without
seeming
to
take
in
the
sense
her
apprehension
was
dulled
by
the
passion
of
the
last
hour
and
she
found
it
difficult
to
call
up
the
ideas
suggested
by
the
words
at
last
she
began
to
have
a
distinct
conception
of
the
impending
interview
with
sir
christopher
the
idea
of
displeasing
the
baronet
of
whom
every
one
at
the
manor
stood
in
awe
frightened
her
so
much
that
she
thought
it
would
be
impossible
to
resist
his
wish
he
believed
that
she
loved
maynard
he
had
always
spoken
as
if
he
were
quite
sure
of
it
how
could
she
tell
him
he
was
deceived
and
what
if
he
were
to
ask
her
whether
she
loved
anybody
else
to
have
sir
christopher
looking
angrily
at
her
was
more
than
she
could
bear
even
in
imagination
he
had
always
been
so
good
to
her
then
she
began
to
think
of
the
pain
she
might
give
him
and
the
more
selfish
distress
of
fear
gave
way
to
the
distress
of
affection
unselfish
tears
began
to
flow
and
sorrowful
gratitude
to
sir
christopher
helped
to
awaken
her
sensibility
to
gilfil
tenderness
and
generosity
good
maynard
what
a
poor
return
i
make
him
if
i
could
but
have
loved
him
instead
but
i
can
never
love
or
care
for
anything
again
my
heart
is
broken
chapter
the
next
morning
the
dreaded
moment
came
caterina
stupified
by
the
suffering
of
the
previous
night
with
that
dull
mental
aching
which
follows
on
acute
anguish
was
in
lady
cheverel
copying
out
some
charity
lists
when
her
ladyship
came
in
and
said
sir
christopher
wants
you
go
down
into
the
library
she
went
down
trembling
as
soon
as
she
entered
sir
christopher
who
was
seated
near
his
said
little
monkey
come
and
sit
down
by
me
i
have
something
to
tell
you
caterina
took
a
footstool
and
seated
herself
on
it
at
the
feet
it
was
her
habit
to
sit
on
these
low
stools
and
in
this
way
she
could
hide
her
face
better
she
put
her
little
arm
round
his
leg
and
leaned
her
cheek
against
his
knee
you
seem
out
of
spirits
this
morning
tina
what
the
matter
eh
padroncello
only
my
head
is
bad
monkey
well
now
would
it
do
the
head
good
if
i
were
to
promise
you
a
good
husband
and
smart
little
and
a
house
of
your
own
where
you
would
be
a
little
mistress
and
padroncello
would
come
and
see
you
sometimes
no
no
i
should
like
ever
to
be
married
let
me
always
stay
with
you
pooh
little
simpleton
i
shall
get
old
and
tiresome
and
there
will
be
anthony
children
putting
your
nose
out
of
joint
you
will
want
some
one
to
love
you
best
of
all
and
you
must
have
children
of
your
own
to
love
i
ca
have
you
withering
away
into
an
old
maid
i
hate
old
maids
they
make
me
dismal
to
look
at
them
i
never
see
sharp
without
shuddering
my
little
monkey
was
never
meant
for
anything
so
ugly
and
there
maynard
gilfil
the
best
man
in
the
county
worth
his
weight
in
gold
heavy
as
he
is
he
loves
you
better
than
his
eyes
and
you
love
him
too
you
silly
monkey
whatever
you
may
say
about
not
being
married
no
dear
padroncello
do
not
say
so
i
could
not
marry
him
not
you
foolish
child
you
do
know
your
own
mind
why
it
is
plain
to
everybody
that
you
love
him
my
lady
has
all
along
said
she
was
sure
you
loved
him
she
has
seen
what
little
princess
airs
you
put
on
to
him
and
anthony
too
he
thinks
you
are
in
love
with
gilfil
come
what
has
made
you
take
it
into
your
head
that
you
would
like
to
marry
him
caterina
was
now
sobbing
too
deeply
to
make
any
answer
sir
christopher
patted
her
on
the
back
and
said
come
why
tina
you
are
not
well
this
morning
go
and
rest
little
one
you
will
see
things
in
quite
another
light
when
you
are
well
think
over
what
i
have
said
and
remember
there
is
nothing
after
anthony
marriage
that
i
have
set
my
heart
on
so
much
as
seeing
you
and
maynard
settled
for
life
i
must
have
no
whims
and
follies
no
nonsense
this
was
said
with
a
slight
severity
but
he
presently
added
in
a
soothing
tone
there
there
stop
crying
and
be
a
good
little
monkey
go
and
lie
down
and
get
to
sleep
caterina
slipped
from
the
stool
on
to
her
knees
took
the
old
hand
covered
it
with
tears
and
kisses
and
then
ran
out
of
the
room
before
the
evening
captain
wybrow
had
heard
from
his
uncle
the
result
of
the
interview
with
caterina
he
thought
i
could
have
a
long
quiet
talk
with
her
i
could
perhaps
persuade
her
to
look
more
reasonably
at
things
but
there
no
speaking
to
her
in
the
house
without
being
interrupted
and
i
can
hardly
see
her
anywhere
else
without
finding
it
out
at
last
he
determined
to
make
it
a
matter
of
confidence
with
miss
assher
to
tell
her
that
he
wished
to
talk
to
caterina
quietly
for
the
sake
of
bringing
her
to
a
calmer
state
of
mind
and
persuade
her
to
listen
to
gilfil
affection
he
was
very
much
pleased
with
this
judicious
and
candid
plan
and
in
the
course
of
the
evening
he
had
arranged
with
himself
the
time
and
place
of
meeting
and
had
communicated
his
purpose
to
miss
assher
who
gave
her
entire
approval
anthony
she
thought
would
do
well
to
speak
plainly
and
seriously
to
miss
sarti
he
was
really
very
patient
and
kind
to
her
considering
how
she
behaved
tina
had
kept
her
room
all
that
day
and
had
been
carefully
tended
as
an
invalid
sir
christopher
having
told
her
ladyship
how
matters
stood
this
tendance
was
so
irksome
to
caterina
she
felt
so
uneasy
under
attentions
and
kindness
that
were
based
on
a
misconception
that
she
exerted
herself
to
appear
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
and
declared
herself
well
though
head
and
heart
were
throbbing
to
be
confined
in
her
own
room
was
intolerable
it
was
wretched
enough
to
be
looked
at
and
spoken
to
but
it
was
more
wretched
to
be
left
alone
she
was
frightened
at
her
own
sensations
she
was
frightened
at
the
imperious
vividness
with
which
pictures
of
the
past
and
future
thrust
themselves
on
her
imagination
and
there
was
another
feeling
too
which
made
her
want
to
be
and
moving
about
perhaps
she
might
have
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
captain
wybrow
alone
of
speaking
those
words
of
hatred
and
scorn
that
burned
on
her
tongue
that
opportunity
offered
itself
in
a
very
unexpected
manner
lady
cheverel
having
sent
caterina
out
of
the
to
fetch
some
patterns
of
embroidery
from
her
captain
wybrow
presently
walked
out
after
her
and
met
her
as
she
was
returning
down
stairs
he
said
laying
his
hand
on
her
arm
as
she
was
hurrying
on
without
looking
at
him
you
meet
me
in
the
rookery
at
twelve
i
must
speak
to
you
and
we
shall
be
in
privacy
there
i
can
not
speak
to
you
in
the
house
to
his
surprise
there
was
a
flash
of
pleasure
across
her
face
she
answered
shortly
and
decidedly
then
snatched
her
arm
away
from
him
and
passed
down
stairs
miss
assher
was
this
morning
busy
winding
silks
being
bent
on
emulating
lady
cheverel
embroidery
and
lady
assher
chose
the
passive
amusement
of
holding
the
skeins
lady
cheverel
had
now
all
her
working
apparatus
about
her
and
caterina
thinking
she
was
not
wanted
went
away
and
sat
down
to
the
harpsichord
in
the
it
seemed
as
if
playing
massive
chords
bringing
out
volumes
of
sound
would
be
the
easiest
way
of
passing
the
long
feverish
moments
before
twelve
messiah
stood
open
on
the
desk
at
the
chorus
we
like
sheep
and
caterina
threw
herself
at
once
into
the
impetuous
intricacies
of
that
magnificent
fugue
in
her
happiest
moments
she
could
never
have
played
it
so
well
for
now
all
the
passion
that
made
her
misery
was
hurled
by
a
convulsive
effort
into
her
music
just
as
pain
gives
new
force
to
the
clutch
of
the
sinking
wrestler
and
as
terror
gives
farsounding
intensity
to
the
shriek
of
the
feeble
but
at
eleven
she
was
interrupted
by
lady
cheverel
who
said
go
down
will
you
and
hold
miss
assher
silks
for
her
lady
assher
and
i
have
decided
on
having
our
drive
before
luncheon
caterina
went
down
wondering
how
she
should
escape
from
the
in
time
to
be
in
the
rookery
at
twelve
nothing
should
prevent
her
from
going
nothing
should
rob
her
of
this
one
precious
moment
perhaps
the
last
when
she
could
speak
out
the
thoughts
that
were
in
her
after
that
she
would
be
passive
she
would
bear
anything
but
she
had
scarcely
sat
down
with
a
skein
of
yellow
silk
on
her
hands
when
miss
assher
said
graciously
know
you
have
an
engagement
with
captain
wybrow
this
morning
you
must
not
let
me
detain
you
beyond
the
time
he
has
been
talking
to
her
about
me
thought
caterina
her
hands
began
to
tremble
as
she
held
the
skein
miss
assher
continued
in
the
same
gracious
tone
is
tedious
work
holding
these
skeins
i
am
sure
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
you
are
not
obliged
to
me
said
caterina
completely
mastered
by
her
irritation
have
only
done
it
because
lady
cheverel
told
me
the
moment
was
come
when
miss
assher
could
no
longer
suppress
her
long
latent
desire
to
miss
sarti
know
the
impropriety
of
her
conduct
with
the
malicious
anger
that
assumes
the
tone
of
compassion
she
said
sarti
i
am
really
sorry
for
you
that
you
are
not
able
to
control
yourself
better
this
giving
way
to
unwarrantable
feelings
is
lowering
you
it
is
indeed
unwarrantable
feelings
said
caterina
letting
her
hands
fall
and
fixing
her
great
dark
eyes
steadily
on
miss
assher
is
quite
unnecessary
for
me
to
say
more
you
must
be
conscious
what
i
mean
only
summon
a
sense
of
duty
to
your
aid
you
are
paining
captain
wybrow
extremely
by
your
want
of
he
tell
you
i
pained
him
indeed
he
did
he
is
very
much
hurt
that
you
should
behave
to
me
as
if
you
had
a
sort
of
enmity
towards
me
he
would
like
you
to
make
a
friend
of
me
i
assure
you
we
both
feel
very
kindly
towards
you
and
are
sorry
you
should
cherish
such
feelings
is
very
good
said
caterina
bitterly
feelings
did
he
say
i
cherished
this
bitter
tone
increased
miss
assher
irritation
there
was
still
a
lurking
suspicion
in
her
mind
though
she
would
not
admit
it
to
herself
that
captain
wybrow
had
told
her
a
falsehood
about
his
conduct
and
feelings
towards
caterina
it
was
this
suspicion
more
even
than
the
anger
of
the
moment
which
urged
her
to
say
something
that
would
test
the
truth
of
his
statement
that
she
would
be
humiliating
caterina
at
the
same
time
was
only
an
additional
temptation
are
things
i
do
not
like
to
talk
of
miss
sarti
i
can
not
even
understand
how
a
woman
can
indulge
a
passion
for
a
man
who
has
never
given
her
the
least
ground
for
it
as
captain
wybrow
assures
me
is
the
case
told
you
that
did
he
said
caterina
in
clear
low
tones
her
lips
turning
white
as
she
rose
from
her
chair
indeed
he
did
he
was
bound
to
tell
it
me
after
your
strange
behaviour
caterina
said
nothing
but
turned
round
suddenly
and
left
the
room
see
how
she
rushes
noiselessly
like
a
pale
meteor
along
the
passages
and
up
the
gallery
stairs
those
gleaming
eyes
those
bloodless
lips
that
swift
silent
tread
make
her
look
like
the
incarnation
of
a
fierce
purpose
rather
than
a
woman
the
sun
is
shining
on
the
armour
in
the
gallery
making
mimic
suns
on
bossed
and
the
angles
of
polished
yes
there
are
sharp
weapons
in
the
gallery
there
is
a
dagger
in
that
cabinet
she
knows
it
well
and
as
a
wheels
in
its
flight
to
alight
for
an
instant
on
a
leaf
she
darts
to
the
cabinet
takes
out
the
dagger
and
thrusts
it
into
her
pocket
in
three
minutes
more
she
is
out
in
hat
and
cloak
on
the
hurrying
along
towards
the
thick
shades
of
the
distant
rookery
she
threads
the
windings
of
the
plantations
not
feeling
the
golden
leaves
that
rain
upon
her
not
feeling
the
earth
beneath
her
feet
her
hand
is
in
her
pocket
clenching
the
handle
of
the
dagger
which
she
holds
half
out
of
its
sheath
she
has
reached
the
rookery
and
is
under
the
gloom
of
the
interlacing
boughs
her
heart
throbs
as
if
it
would
burst
her
bosom
as
if
every
next
leap
must
be

last

wait

till
she
has
done
this
one
deed
he
will
be
there
he
will
be
before
her
in
a
moment
he
will
come
towards
her
with
that
false
smile
thinking
she
does
not
know
his
baseness
she
will
plunge
that
dagger
into
his
heart
poor
child
poor
child
she
who
used
to
cry
to
have
the
fish
put
back
into
the
water
who
never
willingly
killed
the
smallest
living
thing
dreams
now
in
the
madness
of
her
passion
that
she
can
kill
the
man
whose
very
voice
unnerves
her
but
what
is
that
lying
among
the
dank
leaves
on
the
path
three
yards
before
her
good
god
it
is
he
lying
motionless
his
hat
fallen
off
he
is
ill
then
he
has
fainted
her
hand
lets
go
the
dagger
and
she
rushes
towards
him
his
eyes
are
fixed
he
does
not
see
her
she
sinks
down
on
her
knees
takes
the
dear
head
in
her
arms
and
kisses
the
cold
forehead

me
it

speak
to

o

he
is
dead
chapter
maynard
said
sir
christopher
chatting
with
gilfil
in
the
library
really
is
a
remarkable
thing
that
i
never
in
my
life
laid
a
plan
and
failed
to
carry
it
out
i
lay
my
plans
well
and
i
never
swerve
from
them
that
it
a
strong
will
is
the
only
magic
and
next
to
striking
out
one
plans
the
pleasantest
thing
in
the
world
is
to
see
them
well
accomplished
this
year
now
will
be
the
happiest
of
my
life
all
but
the
year
when
i
came
into
possession
of
the
manor
and
married
henrietta
the
last
touch
is
given
to
the
old
house
marriage
the
thing
i
had
nearest
my
heart
is
settled
to
my
entire
satisfaction
and
you
will
be
buying
a
little
for
tina
finger
do
shake
your
head
in
that
forlorn
way
when
i
make
prophecies
they
generally
come
to
pass
but
there
a
quarter
after
twelve
striking
i
must
be
riding
to
the
high
ash
to
meet
markham
about
felling
some
timber
my
old
oaks
will
have
to
groan
for
this
wedding
but
the
door
burst
open
and
caterina
ghastly
and
panting
her
eyes
distended
with
terror
rushed
in
threw
her
arms
round
sir
neck
and
gasping
out
the
rookery
dead
in
the
rookery
fell
fainting
on
the
floor
in
a
moment
sir
christopher
was
out
of
the
room
and
gilfil
was
bending
to
raise
caterina
in
his
arms
as
he
lifted
her
from
the
ground
he
felt
something
hard
and
heavy
in
her
pocket
what
could
it
be
the
weight
of
it
would
be
enough
to
hurt
her
as
she
lay
he
carried
her
to
the
sofa
put
his
hand
in
her
pocket
and
drew
forth
the
dagger
maynard
shuddered
did
she
mean
to
kill
herself
then
or
or
a
horrible
suspicion
forced
itself
upon
him
in
the
rookery
he
hated
himself
for
the
thought
that
prompted
him
to
draw
the
dagger
from
its
sheath
no
there
was
no
trace
of
blood
and
he
was
ready
to
kiss
the
good
steel
for
its
innocence
he
thrust
the
weapon
into
his
own
pocket
he
would
restore
it
as
soon
as
possible
to
its
place
in
the
gallery
yet
why
had
caterina
taken
this
dagger
what
was
it
that
had
happened
in
the
rookery
was
it
only
a
delirious
vision
of
hers
he
was
afraid
to
ring
afraid
to
summon
any
one
to
caterina
assistance
what
might
she
not
say
when
she
awoke
from
this
fainting
fit
she
might
be
raving
he
could
not
leave
her
and
yet
he
felt
as
if
he
were
guilty
for
not
following
sir
christopher
to
see
what
was
the
truth
it
took
but
a
moment
to
think
and
feel
all
this
but
that
moment
seemed
such
a
long
agony
to
him
that
he
began
to
reproach
himself
for
letting
it
pass
without
seeking
some
means
of
reviving
caterina
happily
the
decanter
of
water
on
sir
christopher
table
was
untouched
he
would
at
least
try
the
effect
of
throwing
that
water
over
her
she
might
revive
without
his
needing
to
call
any
one
else
meanwhile
sir
christopher
was
hurrying
at
his
utmost
speed
towards
the
rookery
his
face
so
lately
bright
and
confident
now
agitated
by
a
vague
dread
the
deep
alarmed
bark
of
rupert
who
ran
by
his
side
had
struck
the
ear
of
bates
then
on
his
way
homeward
as
something
unwonted
and
hastening
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
he
met
the
baronet
just
as
he
was
approaching
the
entrance
of
the
rookery
sir
christopher
look
was
enough
bates
said
nothing
but
hurried
along
by
his
side
while
rupert
dashed
forward
among
the
dead
leaves
with
his
nose
to
the
ground
they
had
scarcely
lost
sight
of
him
a
minute
when
a
change
in
the
tone
of
his
bark
told
them
that
he
had
found
something
and
in
another
instant
he
was
leaping
back
over
one
of
the
large
planted
mounds
they
turned
aside
to
ascend
the
mound
rupert
leading
them
the
tumultuous
cawing
of
the
rooks
the
very
rustling
of
the
leaves
as
their
feet
plunged
among
them
falling
like
an
evil
omen
on
the
baronet
ear
they
had
reached
the
summit
of
the
mound
and
had
begun
to
descend
sir
christopher
saw
something
purple
down
on
the
path
below
among
the
yellow
leaves
rupert
was
already
beside
it
but
sir
christopher
could
not
move
faster
a
tremor
had
taken
hold
of
the
firm
limbs
rupert
came
back
and
licked
the
trembling
hand
as
if
to
say
and
then
was
down
again
snuffing
the
body
yes
it
was
a
body
anthony
body
there
was
the
white
hand
with
its
clutching
the
dark
leaves
his
eyes
were
half
open
but
did
not
heed
the
gleam
of
sunlight
that
darted
itself
directly
on
them
from
between
the
boughs
still
he
might
only
have
fainted
it
might
only
be
a
fit
sir
christopher
knelt
down
unfastened
the
cravat
unfastened
the
waistcoat
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
heart
it
might
be
syncope
it
might
not
it
could
not
be
death
no
that
thought
must
be
kept
far
off
bates
get
help
we
carry
him
to
your
cottage
send
some
one
to
the
house
to
tell
gilfil
and
warren
bid
them
send
off
for
doctor
hart
and
break
it
to
my
lady
and
miss
assher
that
anthony
is
bates
hastened
away
and
the
baronet
was
left
alone
kneeling
beside
the
body
the
young
and
supple
limbs
the
rounded
cheeks
the
delicate
ripe
lips
the
smooth
white
hands
were
lying
cold
and
rigid
and
the
aged
face
was
bending
over
them
in
silent
anguish
the
aged
hands
were
seeking
with
tremulous
inquiring
touches
for
some
symptom
that
life
was
not
irrevocably
gone
rupert
was
there
too
waiting
and
watching
licking
first
the
dead
and
then
the
living
hands
then
running
off
on
bates
track
as
if
he
would
follow
and
hasten
his
return
but
in
a
moment
turning
back
again
unable
to
quit
the
scene
of
his
master
sorrow
chapter
it
is
a
wonderful
moment
the
first
time
we
stand
by
one
who
has
fainted
and
witness
the
fresh
birth
of
consciousness
spreading
itself
over
the
blank
features
like
the
rising
sunlight
on
the
alpine
summits
that
lay
ghastly
and
dead
under
the
leaden
twilight
a
slight
shudder
and
the
eyes
recover
their
liquid
light
for
an
instant
they
show
the
inward
of
an
infant
then
with
a
little
start
they
open
wider
and
begin
to
look
the
present
is
visible
but
only
as
a
strange
writing
and
the
interpreter
memory
is
not
yet
there
gilfil
felt
a
trembling
joy
as
this
change
passed
over
face
he
bent
over
her
rubbing
her
chill
hands
and
looking
at
her
with
tender
pity
as
her
dark
eyes
opened
on
him
wonderingly
he
thought
there
might
be
some
wine
in
the
close
by
he
left
the
room
and
caterina
eyes
turned
towards
the
window
towards
sir
chair
there
was
the
link
at
which
the
chain
of
consciousness
had
snapped
and
the
events
of
the
morning
were
beginning
to
recur
dimly
like
a
dream
when
maynard
returned
with
some
wine
he
raised
her
and
she
drank
it
but
still
she
was
silent
seeming
lost
in
the
attempt
to
recover
the
past
when
the
door
opened
and
warren
appeared
with
looks
that
announced
terrible
tidings
gilfil
dreading
lest
he
should
tell
them
in
caterina
presence
hurried
towards
him
with
his
finger
on
his
lips
and
drew
him
away
into
the
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
passage
caterina
revived
by
the
stimulant
was
now
recovering
the
full
consciousness
of
the
scene
in
the
rookery
anthony
was
lying
there
dead
she
had
left
him
to
tell
sir
christopher
she
must
go
and
see
what
they
were
doing
with
him
perhaps
he
was
not
really
dead
only
in
a
trance
people
did
fall
into
trances
sometimes
while
gilfil
was
telling
warren
how
it
would
be
best
to
break
the
news
to
lady
cheverel
and
miss
assher
anxious
himself
to
return
to
caterina
the
poor
child
had
made
her
way
feebly
to
the
great
which
stood
open
her
strength
increased
as
she
moved
and
breathed
the
fresh
air
and
with
every
increase
of
strength
came
increased
vividness
of
emotion
increased
yearning
to
be
where
her
thought
was
in
the
rookery
with
anthony
she
walked
more
and
more
swiftly
and
at
last
gathering
the
artificial
strength
of
passionate
excitement
began
to
run
but
now
she
heard
the
tread
of
heavy
steps
and
under
the
yellow
shade
near
the
wooden
bridge
she
saw
men
slowly
carrying
something
soon
she
was
face
to
face
with
them
anthony
was
no
longer
in
the
rookery
they
were
carrying
him
stretched
on
a
door
and
there
behind
him
was
sir
christopher
with
the
mouth
the
deathly
paleness
and
the
concentrated
expression
of
suffering
in
the
eye
which
mark
the
suppressed
grief
of
the
strong
man
the
sight
of
this
face
on
which
caterina
had
never
before
beheld
the
signs
of
anguish
caused
a
rush
of
new
feeling
which
for
the
moment
submerged
all
the
rest
she
went
gently
up
to
him
put
her
little
hand
in
his
and
walked
in
silence
by
his
side
sir
christopher
could
not
tell
her
to
leave
him
and
so
she
went
on
with
that
sad
procession
to
bates
cottage
in
the
mosslands
and
sat
there
in
silence
waiting
and
watching
to
know
if
anthony
were
really
dead
she
had
not
yet
missed
the
dagger
from
her
pocket
she
had
not
yet
even
thought
of
it
at
the
sight
of
anthony
lying
dead
her
nature
had
rebounded
from
its
new
bias
of
resentment
and
hatred
to
the
old
sweet
habit
of
love
the
earliest
and
the
longest
has
still
the
mastery
over
us
and
the
only
past
that
linked
itself
with
those
glazed
unconscious
eyes
was
the
past
when
they
beamed
on
her
with
tenderness
she
forgot
the
interval
of
wrong
and
jealousy
and
hatred
all
his
cruelty
and
all
her
thoughts
of
revenge
as
the
exile
forgets
the
stormy
passage
that
lay
between
home
and
happiness
and
the
dreary
land
in
which
he
finds
himself
desolate
chapter
before
night
all
hope
was
gone
dr
hart
had
said
it
was
death
body
had
been
carried
to
the
house
and
every
one
there
knew
the
calamity
that
had
fallen
on
them
caterina
had
been
questioned
by
dr
hart
and
had
answered
briefly
that
she
found
anthony
lying
in
the
rookery
that
she
should
have
been
walking
there
just
at
that
time
was
not
a
coincidence
to
raise
conjectures
in
any
one
besides
gilfil
except
in
answering
this
question
she
had
not
broken
her
silence
she
sat
mute
in
a
corner
of
the
gardener
kitchen
shaking
her
head
when
maynard
entreated
her
to
return
with
him
and
apparently
unable
to
think
of
anything
but
the
possibility
that
anthony
might
revive
until
she
saw
them
carrying
away
the
body
to
the
house
then
she
followed
by
sir
christopher
side
again
so
quietly
that
even
dr
hart
did
not
object
to
her
presence
it
was
decided
to
lay
the
body
in
the
library
until
after
the
inquest
and
when
caterina
saw
the
door
finally
closed
she
turned
up
the
gallery
stairs
on
her
way
to
her
own
room
the
place
where
she
felt
at
home
with
her
sorrows
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
in
the
gallery
since
that
terrible
moment
in
the
morning
and
now
the
spot
and
the
objects
around
began
to
reawaken
her
memory
the
armour
was
no
longer
glittering
in
the
sunlight
but
there
it
hung
dead
and
sombre
above
the
cabinet
from
which
she
had
taken
the
dagger
yes
now
it
all
came
back
to
her
all
the
wretchedness
and
all
the
sin
but
where
was
the
dagger
now
she
felt
in
her
pocket
it
was
not
there
could
it
have
been
her
fancy
all
that
about
the
dagger
she
looked
in
the
cabinet
it
was
not
there
alas
no
it
could
not
have
been
her
fancy
and
she
guilty
of
that
wickedness
but
where
could
the
dagger
be
now
could
it
have
fallen
out
of
her
pocket
she
heard
steps
ascending
the
stairs
and
hurried
on
to
her
room
where
kneeling
by
the
bed
and
burying
her
face
to
shut
out
the
hateful
light
she
tried
to
recall
every
feeling
and
incident
of
the
morning
it
all
came
back
everything
anthony
had
done
and
everything
she
had
felt
for
the
last
month
for
many
months
ever
since
that
june
evening
when
he
had
last
spoken
to
her
in
the
gallery
she
looked
back
on
her
storms
of
passion
her
jealousy
and
hatred
of
miss
assher
her
thoughts
of
revenge
on
anthony
o
how
wicked
she
had
been
it
was
she
who
had
been
sinning
it
was
she
who
had
driven
him
to
do
and
say
those
things
that
had
made
her
so
angry
and
if
he
had
wronged
her
what
had
she
been
on
the
verge
of
doing
to
him
she
was
too
wicked
ever
to
be
pardoned
she
would
like
to
confess
how
wicked
she
had
been
that
they
might
punish
her
she
would
like
to
humble
herself
to
the
dust
before
every
one
before
miss
assher
even
sir
christopher
would
send
her
away
would
never
see
her
again
if
he
knew
all
and
she
would
be
happier
to
be
punished
and
frowned
on
than
to
be
treated
tenderly
while
she
had
that
guilty
secret
in
her
breast
but
then
if
sir
christopher
were
to
know
all
it
would
add
to
his
sorrow
and
make
him
more
wretched
than
ever
no
she
could
not
confess
it
she
should
have
to
tell
about
anthony
but
she
could
not
stay
at
the
manor
she
must
go
away
she
could
not
bear
sir
christopher
eye
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
all
these
things
that
reminded
her
of
anthony
and
of
her
sin
perhaps
she
should
die
soon
she
felt
very
feeble
there
could
not
be
much
life
in
her
she
would
go
away
and
live
humbly
and
pray
to
god
to
pardon
her
and
let
her
die
the
poor
child
never
thought
of
suicide
no
sooner
was
the
storm
of
anger
passed
than
the
tenderness
and
timidity
of
her
nature
returned
and
she
could
do
nothing
but
love
and
mourn
her
inexperience
prevented
her
from
imagining
the
consequences
of
her
disappearance
from
the
manor
she
foresaw
none
of
the
terrible
details
of
alarm
and
distress
and
search
that
must
ensue
will
think
i
am
dead
she
said
to
herself
they
will
forget
me
and
maynard
will
get
happy
again
and
love
some
one
else
she
was
roused
from
her
absorption
by
a
knock
at
the
door
bellamy
was
there
she
had
come
by
gilfil
request
to
see
how
miss
sarti

caterina
took
the
arrowroot
quite
eagerly
while
martha
was
lighting
her
fire
she
wanted
to
get
strength
for
her
journey
and
she
kept
the
plate
of
biscuits
by
her
that
she
might
put
some
in
her
pocket
her
whole
mind
was
now
bent
on
going
away
from
the
manor
and
she
was
thinking
of
all
the
ways
and
means
her
little
life
experience
could
suggest
it
was
dusk
now
she
must
wait
till
early
dawn
for
she
was
too
timid
to
go
away
in
the
dark
but
she
must
make
her
escape
before
any
one
was
up
in
the
house
there
would
be
people
watching
anthony
in
the
library
but
she
could
make
her
way
out
of
a
small
door
leading
into
the
garden
against
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
she
laid
her
cloak
bonnet
and
veil
ready
then
she
lighted
a
candle
opened
her
desk
and
took
out
the
broken
portrait
wrapped
in
paper
she
folded
it
again
in
two
little
notes
of
anthony
written
in
pencil
and
placed
it
in
her
bosom
there
was
the
little
china
box
too
present
the
pearl
and
a
silk
purse
with
fifteen
pieces
in
it
the
presents
sir
christopher
had
made
her
on
her
birthday
ever
since
she
had
been
at
the
manor
should
she
take
the
earrings
and
the
pieces
she
could
not
bear
to
part
with
them
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
some
of
sir
christopher
love
in
them
she
would
like
them
to
be
buried
with
her
she
fastened
the
little
round
earrings
in
her
ears
and
put
the
purse
with
dorcas
box
in
her
pocket
she
had
another
purse
there
and
she
took
it
out
to
count
her
money
for
she
would
never
spend
her
pieces
she
had
a
guinea
and
eight
shillings
that
would
be
plenty
so
now
she
sat
down
to
wait
for
the
morning
afraid
to
lay
herself
on
the
bed
lest
she
should
sleep
too
long
if
she
could
but
see
anthony
once
more
and
kiss
his
cold
forehead
but
that
could
not
be
she
did
not
deserve
it
she
must
go
away
from
him
away
from
sir
christopher
and
lady
cheverel
and
maynard
and
everybody
who
had
been
kind
to
her
and
thought
her
good
while
she
was
so
wicked
chapter
some
of
sharp
earliest
thoughts
the
next
morning
were
given
to
caterina
whom
she
had
not
been
able
to
visit
the
evening
before
and
whom
from
a
nearly
equal
mixture
of
affection
and
she
did
not
at
all
like
resigning
to
bellamy
care
at
eight
she
went
up
to
tina
room
bent
on
benevolent
dictation
as
to
doses
and
diet
and
lying
in
bed
but
on
opening
the
door
she
found
the
bed
smooth
and
empty
evidently
it
had
not
been
slept
in
what
could
this
mean
had
she
sat
up
all
night
and
was
she
gone
out
to
walk
the
poor
thing
head
might
be
touched
by
what
had
happened
yesterday
it
was
such
a
shock
finding
captain
wybrow
in
that
way
she
was
perhaps
gone
out
of
her
mind
sharp
looked
anxiously
in
the
place
where
tina
kept
her
hat
and
cloak
they
were
not
there
so
that
she
had
had
at
least
the
presence
of
mind
to
put
them
on
still
the
good
woman
felt
greatly
alarmed
and
hastened
away
to
tell
gilfil
who
she
knew
was
in
his
study
gilfil
she
said
as
soon
as
she
had
closed
the
door
behind
her
mind
misgives
me
dreadful
about
miss
sarti
is
it
said
poor
maynard
with
a
horrible
fear
that
caterina
had
betrayed
something
about
the
dagger
not
in
her
room
an
her
bed
not
been
slept
in
this
night
her
hat
an
cloak
gone
for
a
minute
or
two
gilfil
was
unable
to
speak
he
felt
sure
the
worst
had
come
caterina
had
destroyed
herself
the
strong
man
suddenly
looked
so
ill
and
helpless
that
sharp
began
to
be
frightened
at
the
effect
of
her
abruptness
sir
i
grieved
to
my
heart
to
shock
you
so
but
i
did
know
who
else
to
go
to
no
you
were
quite
right
he
gathered
some
strength
from
his
very
despair
it
was
all
over
and
he
had
nothing
now
to
do
but
to
suffer
and
to
help
the
suffering
he
went
on
in
a
firmer
voice
sure
not
to
breathe
a
word
about
it
to
any
one
we
must
not
alarm
lady
cheverel
and
sir
christopher
miss
sarti
may
be
only
walking
in
the
garden
she
was
terribly
excited
by
what
she
saw
yesterday
and
perhaps
was
unable
to
lie
down
from
restlessness
just
go
quietly
through
the
empty
rooms
and
see
whether
she
is
in
the
house
i
will
go
and
look
for
her
in
the
grounds
he
went
down
and
to
avoid
giving
any
alarm
in
the
house
walked
at
once
towards
the
mosslands
in
search
of
bates
whom
he
met
returning
from
his
breakfast
to
the
gardener
he
confided
his
fear
about
caterina
assigning
as
a
reason
for
this
fear
the
probability
that
the
shock
she
had
undergone
yesterday
had
unhinged
her
mind
and
begging
him
to
send
men
in
search
of
her
through
the
gardens
and
park
and
inquire
if
she
had
been
seen
at
the
lodges
and
if
she
were
not
found
or
heard
of
in
this
way
to
lose
no
time
in
dragging
the
waters
round
the
manor
forbid
it
should
be
so
bates
but
we
shall
be
the
easier
for
having
searched
everywhere
to
mae
troost
to
mae
gilfil
eh
but
i
ha
worked
for
all
the
rest
o
my
life
rether
than
anythin
should
happened
to
her
the
good
gardener
in
deep
distress
strode
away
to
the
stables
that
he
might
send
the
grooms
on
horseback
through
the
park
gilfil
next
thought
was
to
search
the
rookery
she
might
be
haunting
the
scene
of
captain
wybrow
death
he
went
hastily
over
every
mound
looked
round
every
large
tree
and
followed
every
winding
of
the
walks
in
reality
he
had
little
hope
of
finding
her
there
but
the
bare
possibility
fenced
off
for
a
time
the
fatal
conviction
that
body
would
be
found
in
the
water
when
the
rookery
had
been
searched
in
vain
he
walked
fast
to
the
border
of
the
little
stream
that
bounded
one
side
of
the
grounds
the
stream
was
almost
everywhere
hidden
among
trees
and
there
was
one
place
where
it
was
broader
and
deeper
than
elsewhere
she
would
be
more
likely
to
come
to
that
spot
than
to
the
pool
he
hurried
along
with
strained
eyes
his
imagination
continually
creating
what
he
dreaded
to
see
there
is
something
white
behind
that
overhanging
bough
his
knees
tremble
under
him
he
seems
to
see
part
of
her
dress
caught
on
a
branch
and
her
dear
dead
face
upturned
o
god
give
strength
to
thy
creature
on
whom
thou
hast
laid
this
great
agony
he
is
nearly
up
to
the
bough
and
the
white
object
is
moving
it
is
a
waterfowl
that
spreads
its
wings
and
flies
away
screaming
he
hardly
knows
whether
it
is
a
relief
or
a
disappointment
that
she
is
not
there
the
conviction
that
she
is
dead
presses
its
cold
weight
upon
him
none
the
less
heavily
as
he
reached
the
great
pool
in
front
of
the
manor
he
saw
bates
with
a
group
of
men
already
there
preparing
for
the
dreadful
search
which
could
only
displace
his
vague
despair
by
a
definite
horror
for
the
gardener
in
his
restless
anxiety
had
been
unable
to
defer
this
until
other
means
of
search
had
proved
vain
the
pool
was
not
now
laughing
with
sparkles
among
the
it
looked
black
and
cruel
under
the
sombre
sky
as
if
its
cold
depths
held
relentlessly
all
the
murdered
hope
and
joy
of
maynard
gilfil
life
thoughts
of
the
sad
consequences
for
others
as
well
as
himself
were
crowding
on
his
mind
the
blinds
and
shutters
were
all
closed
in
front
of
the
manor
and
it
was
not
likely
that
sir
christopher
would
be
aware
of
anything
that
was
passing
outside
but
gilfil
felt
that
disappearance
could
not
long
be
concealed
from
him
the
coroner
inquest
would
be
held
shortly
she
would
be
inquired
for
and
then
it
would
be
inevitable
that
the
baronet
should
know
all
chapter
at
twelve
when
all
search
and
inquiry
had
been
in
vain
and
the
coroner
was
expected
every
moment
gilfil
could
no
longer
defer
the
hard
duty
of
revealing
this
fresh
calamity
to
sir
christopher
who
must
otherwise
have
it
discovered
to
him
abruptly
the
baronet
was
seated
in
his
where
the
dark
were
drawn
so
as
to
admit
only
a
sombre
light
it
was
the
first
time
gilfil
had
had
an
interview
with
him
this
morning
and
he
was
struck
to
see
how
a
single
day
and
night
of
grief
had
aged
the
fine
old
man
the
lines
in
his
brow
and
about
his
mouth
were
deepened
his
complexion
looked
dull
and
withered
there
was
a
swollen
ridge
under
his
eyes
and
the
eyes
themselves
which
used
to
cast
so
keen
a
glance
on
the
present
had
the
vacant
expression
which
tells
that
vision
is
no
longer
a
sense
but
a
memory
he
held
out
his
hand
to
maynard
who
pressed
it
and
sat
down
beside
him
in
silence
sir
christopher
heart
began
to
swell
at
this
unspoken
sympathy
the
tears
would
rise
would
roll
in
great
drops
down
his
cheeks
the
first
tears
he
had
shed
since
boyhood
were
for
anthony
maynard
felt
as
if
his
tongue
were
glued
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
he
could
not
speak
first
he
must
wait
until
sir
christopher
said
something
which
might
lead
on
to
the
cruel
words
that
must
be
spoken
at
last
the
baronet
mastered
himself
enough
to
say
very
weak
maynard
god
help
me
i
did
think
anything
would
unman
me
in
this
way
but
i
built
everything
on
that
lad
perhaps
i
been
wrong
in
not
forgiving
my
sister
she
lost
one
of
sons
a
little
while
ago
been
too
proud
and
obstinate
can
hardly
learn
humility
and
tenderness
enough
except
by
suffering
said
maynard
god
sees
we
are
in
need
of
suffering
for
it
is
falling
more
and
more
heavily
on
us
we
have
a
new
trouble
this
morning
said
sir
christopher
looking
up
anxiously
tina
ill
am
in
dreadful
uncertainty
about
her
she
was
very
much
agitated
yesterday
and
with
her
delicate
health
i
am
afraid
to
think
what
turn
the
agitation
may
have
taken
she
delirious
poor
dear
little
one
only
knows
how
she
is
we
are
unable
to
find
her
when
sharp
went
up
to
her
room
this
morning
it
was
empty
she
had
not
been
in
bed
her
hat
and
cloak
were
gone
i
have
had
search
made
for
her
everywhere
in
the
house
and
garden
in
the
park
and
in
the
water
no
one
has
seen
her
since
martha
went
up
to
light
her
fire
at
seven
in
the
evening
while
gilfil
was
speaking
sir
christopher
eyes
which
were
eagerly
turned
on
him
recovered
some
of
their
old
keenness
and
some
sudden
painful
emotion
as
at
a
new
thought
flitted
rapidly
across
his
already
agitated
face
like
the
shadow
of
a
dark
cloud
over
the
waves
when
the
pause
came
he
laid
his
hand
on
gilfil
arm
and
said
in
a
lower
voice
did
that
poor
thing
love
anthony
did
maynard
hesitated
after
these
words
struggling
between
his
reluctance
to
inflict
a
yet
deeper
wound
on
sir
christopher
and
his
determination
that
no
injustice
should
be
done
to
caterina
sir
christopher
eyes
were
still
fixed
on
him
in
solemn
inquiry
and
his
own
sunk
towards
the
ground
while
he
tried
to
find
the
words
that
would
tell
the
truth
least
cruelly
must
not
have
any
wrong
thoughts
about
tina
he
said
at
length
must
tell
you
now
for
her
sake
what
nothing
but
this
should
ever
have
caused
to
pass
my
lips
captain
wybrow
won
her
affections
by
attentions
which
in
his
position
he
was
bound
not
to
show
her
before
his
marriage
was
talked
of
he
had
behaved
to
her
like
a
lover
sir
christopher
relaxed
his
hold
of
maynard
arm
and
looked
away
from
him
he
was
silent
for
some
minutes
evidently
attempting
to
master
himself
so
as
to
be
able
to
speak
calmly
must
see
henrietta
immediately
he
said
at
last
with
something
of
his
old
sharp
decision
must
know
all
but
we
must
keep
it
from
every
one
else
as
far
as
possible
my
dear
boy
he
continued
in
a
kinder
tone
heaviest
burthen
has
fallen
on
you
but
we
may
find
her
yet
we
must
not
despair
there
has
not
been
time
enough
for
us
to
be
certain
poor
dear
little
one
god
help
me
i
thought
i
saw
everything
and
was
all
the
while
chapter
the
sad
slow
week
was
gone
by
at
last
at
the
coroner
inquest
a
verdict
of
sudden
death
had
been
pronounced
dr
hart
acquainted
with
captain
wybrow
previous
state
of
health
had
given
his
opinion
that
death
had
been
imminent
from
disease
of
the
heart
though
it
had
probably
been
accelerated
by
some
unusual
emotion
miss
assher
was
the
only
person
who
positively
knew
the
motive
that
had
led
captain
wybrow
to
the
rookery
but
she
had
not
mentioned
caterina
name
and
all
painful
details
or
inquiries
were
studiously
kept
from
her
gilfil
and
sir
christopher
however
knew
enough
to
conjecture
that
the
fatal
agitation
was
due
to
an
appointed
meeting
with
caterina
all
search
and
inquiry
after
her
had
been
fruitless
and
were
the
more
likely
to
be
so
because
they
were
carried
on
under
the
prepossession
that
she
had
committed
suicide
no
one
noticed
the
absence
of
the
trifles
she
had
taken
from
her
desk
no
one
knew
of
the
likeness
or
that
she
had
hoarded
her
pieces
and
it
was
not
remarkable
that
she
should
have
happened
to
be
wearing
the
pearl
earrings
she
had
left
the
house
they
thought
taking
nothing
with
her
it
seemed
impossible
she
could
have
gone
far
and
she
must
have
been
in
a
state
of
mental
excitement
that
made
it
too
probable
she
had
only
gone
to
seek
relief
in
death
the
same
places
within
three
or
four
miles
of
the
manor
were
searched
again
and
again
every
pond
every
ditch
in
the
neighbourhood
was
examined
sometimes
maynard
thought
that
death
might
have
come
on
unsought
from
cold
and
exhaustion
and
not
a
day
passed
but
he
wandered
through
the
neighbouring
woods
turning
up
the
heaps
of
dead
leaves
as
if
it
were
possible
her
dear
body
could
be
hidden
there
then
another
horrible
thought
recurred
and
before
each
night
came
he
had
been
again
through
all
the
uninhabited
rooms
of
the
house
to
satisfy
himself
once
more
that
she
was
not
hidden
behind
some
cabinet
or
door
or
curtain
that
he
should
not
find
her
there
with
madness
in
her
eyes
looking
and
looking
and
yet
not
seeing
him
but
at
last
those
five
long
days
and
nights
were
at
an
end
the
funeral
was
over
and
the
carriages
were
returning
through
the
park
when
they
had
set
out
a
heavy
rain
was
falling
but
now
the
clouds
were
breaking
up
and
a
gleam
of
sunshine
was
sparkling
among
the
dripping
boughs
under
which
they
were
passing
this
gleam
fell
upon
a
man
on
horseback
who
was
jogging
slowly
along
and
whom
gilfil
recognized
in
spite
of
diminished
rotundity
as
daniel
knott
the
coachman
who
had
married
the
dorcas
ten
years
before
every
new
incident
suggested
the
same
thought
to
gilfil
and
his
eye
no
sooner
fell
on
knott
than
he
said
to
himself
he
be
come
to
tell
us
anything
about
caterina
then
he
remembered
that
caterina
had
been
very
fond
of
dorcas
and
that
she
always
had
some
present
ready
to
send
her
when
knott
paid
an
occasional
visit
to
the
manor
could
tina
have
gone
to
dorcas
but
his
heart
sank
again
as
he
thought
very
likely
knott
had
only
come
because
he
had
heard
of
captain
wybrow
death
and
wanted
to
know
how
his
old
master
had
borne
the
blow
as
soon
as
the
carriage
reached
the
house
he
went
up
to
his
study
and
walked
about
nervously
longing
but
afraid
to
go
down
and
speak
to
knott
lest
his
faint
hope
should
be
dissipated
any
one
looking
at
that
face
usually
so
full
of
calm
goodwill
would
have
seen
that
the
last
week
suffering
had
left
deep
traces
by
day
he
had
been
riding
or
wandering
incessantly
either
searching
for
caterina
himself
or
directing
inquiries
to
be
made
by
others
by
night
he
had
not
known
sleep
only
intermittent
dozing
in
which
he
seemed
to
be
finding
caterina
dead
and
woke
up
with
a
start
from
this
unreal
agony
to
the
real
anguish
of
believing
that
he
should
see
her
no
more
the
clear
grey
eyes
looked
sunken
and
restless
the
full
careless
lips
had
a
strange
tension
about
them
and
the
brow
formerly
so
smooth
and
open
was
contracted
as
if
with
pain
he
had
not
lost
the
object
of
a
few
passion
he
had
lost
the
being
who
was
bound
up
with
his
power
of
loving
as
the
brook
we
played
by
or
the
flowers
we
gathered
in
childhood
are
bound
up
with
our
sense
of
beauty
love
meant
nothing
for
him
but
to
love
caterina
for
years
the
thought
of
her
had
been
present
in
everything
like
the
air
and
the
light
and
now
she
was
gone
it
seemed
as
if
all
pleasure
had
lost
its
vehicle
the
sky
the
earth
the
daily
ride
the
daily
talk
might
be
there
but
the
loveliness
and
the
joy
that
were
in
them
had
gone
for
ever
presently
as
he
still
paced
backwards
and
forwards
he
heard
steps
along
the
corridor
and
there
was
a
knock
at
his
door
his
voice
trembled
as
he
said
in
and
the
rush
of
renewed
hope
was
hardly
distinguishable
from
pain
when
he
saw
warren
enter
with
daniel
knott
behind
him
is
come
sir
with
news
of
miss
sarti
i
thought
it
best
to
bring
him
to
you
first
gilfil
could
not
help
going
up
to
the
old
coachman
and
wringing
his
hand
but
he
was
unable
to
speak
and
only
motioned
to
him
to
take
a
chair
while
warren
left
the
room
he
hung
upon
daniel
and
listened
to
his
small
piping
voice
with
the
same
solemn
yearning
expectation
with
which
he
would
have
given
ear
to
the
most
awful
messenger
from
the
land
of
shades
war
dorkis
sir
would
hev

when
dorkis

we

to
be
frightened

could
think
what
had
made
her
come
away
from
the
manor
and
dorkis
was
afeared
there
was
summat
wrong
so
this
mornin
she
could
hold
no
longer
an
would
hev
no
nay
but
i
must
come

so
i
rode
twenty
mile
upo
blackbird
as
thinks
all
the
while
an
turns
sharp
roun
every
thirty
yards
as
if
he

at
the
end
of
a
furrow
i
hed
a
sore
time
wi
him
i
can
tell
you
sir
bless
you
knott
for
coming
said
gilfil
wringing
the
old
coachman
hand
again
go
down
and
have
something
and
rest
yourself
you
will
stay
here
and
i
shall
come
to
you
to
learn
the
nearest
way
to
your
house
i
shall
get
ready
to
ride
there
immediately
when
i
have
spoken
to
sir
christopher
in
an
hour
from
that
time
gilfil
was
galloping
on
a
stout
mare
towards
the
little
muddy
village
of
callam
five
miles
beyond
sloppeter
once
more
he
saw
some
gladness
in
the
afternoon
sunlight
once
more
it
was
a
pleasure
to
see
the
hedgerow
trees
flying
past
him
and
to
be
conscious
of
a
seat
while
his
black
kitty
bounded
beneath
him
and
the
air
whistled
to
the
rhythm
of
her
pace
caterina
was
not
dead
he
had
found
her
his
love
and
tenderness
and
seemed
so
strong
they
must
recall
her
to
life
and
happiness
after
that
week
of
despair
the
rebound
was
so
violent
that
it
carried
his
hopes
at
once
as
far
as
the
utmost
mark
they
had
ever
reached
caterina
would
come
to
love
him
at
last
she
would
be
his
they
had
been
carried
through
all
that
dark
and
weary
way
that
she
might
know
the
depth
of
his
love
how
he
would
cherish
her
his
little
bird
with
the
timid
bright
eye
and
the
sweet
throat
that
trembled
with
love
and
music
she
would
nestle
against
him
and
the
poor
little
breast
which
had
been
so
ruffled
and
bruised
should
be
safe
for
evermore
in
the
love
of
a
brave
and
faithful
man
there
is
always
a
strain
of
maternal
tenderness
he
gives
out
again
those
beams
of
protecting
fondness
which
were
shed
on
him
as
he
lay
on
his
mother
knee
it
was
twilight
as
he
entered
the
village
of
callam
and
asking
a
labourer
the
way
to
daniel
knott
learned
that
it
was
by
the
church
which
showed
its
stumpy
spire
on
a
slight
elevation
of
ground
a
useful
addition
to
the
means
of
identifying
that
desirable
homestead
afforded
by
description
prittiest
place
iver
you
see
though
a
small
full
of
excellent
manure
and
leading
right
up
to
the
door
without
any
frivolous
interruption
from
garden
or
railing
might
perhaps
have
been
enough
to
make
that
description
unmistakably
specific
gilfil
had
no
sooner
reached
the
gate
leading
into
the
than
he
was
descried
by
a
lad
of
nine
prematurely
invested
with
the
or
who
ran
forward
to
let
in
the
unusual
visitor
in
a
moment
dorcas
was
at
the
door
the
roses
on
her
cheeks
apparently
all
the
redder
for
the
three
pair
of
cheeks
which
formed
a
group
round
her
and
for
the
very
fat
baby
who
stared
in
her
arms
and
sucked
a
long
crust
with
calm
relish
it
gilfil
sir
said
dorcas
curtsying
low
as
he
made
his
way
through
the
damp
straw
after
tying
up
his
horse
dorcas

out
of

knowledge

best
kitchen
as
charming
a
room
as
best
kitchens
used
to
be
in
farmhouses
which
had
no
parlours
the
fire
reflected
in
a
bright
row
of
pewter
plates
and
dishes
the
deal
tables
so
clean
you
longed
to
stroke
them
the
in
one
and
a
chair

the
other

tapestried
with
flitches
of

damsel

she
spoken
at
all
since
the
fust
words
dear
dorkis

then
went
off
into
a
faint
an
not
a
word
has
she
spoken
since
i
get
her
t
eat
little
bits
an
sups
o
things
but
she
teks
no
notice
nothin
i
took
up
bessie
wi
me
now
an
then
here
dorcas
lifted
to
her
lap
a
little
girl
of
three
who
was
twisting
a
corner
of
her
mother
apron
and
opening
round
eyes
at
the
gentleman
tek
notice
o
children
sometimes
when
they
wo
o
nothin
else
an
we
gathered
the
autumn
crocuses
out
o
th
orchard
and
bessie
carried
up
in
her
hand
an
put
on
the
bed
i
knowed
how
fond
miss
tina
was
o
flowers
an
them
things
when
she
was
a
little
un
but
she
looked
at
bessie
an
the
flowers
just
the
same
as
if
she
did
see
it
cuts
me
to
th
heart
to
look
at
them
eyes
o
hers
i
think
they
bigger
nor
iver
an
they
look
like
my
poor
baby
as
died
when
it
got
so
thin
o
dear
its
little
hands
you
could
see
thro
but
i
great
hopes
if
she
was
to
see
you
sir
as
come
from
the
manor
it
might
bring
back
her
mind
like
maynard
had
that
hope
too
but
he
felt
cold
mists
of
fear
gathering
round
him
after
the
few
bright
warm
hours
of
joyful
confidence
which
had
passed
since
he
first
heard
that
caterina
was
alive
the
thought
urge
itself
upon
him
that
her
mind
and
body
might
never
recover
the
strain
that
had
been
put
upon
them
that
her
delicate
thread
of
life
had
already
nearly
spun
itself
out
now
dorcas
and
see
how
she
is
but
do
say
anything
about
my
being
here
perhaps
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
wait
till
daylight
before
i
see
her
and
yet
it
would
be
very
hard
to
pass
another
night
in
this
way
dorcas
set
down
little
bessie
and
went
away
the
three
other
children
including
young
daniel
in
his
were
standing
opposite
to
gilfil
watching
him
still
more
shyly
now
they
were
without
their
mother
countenance
he
drew
little
bessie
towards
him
and
set
her
on
his
knee
she
shook
her
yellow
curls
out
of
her
eyes
and
looked
up
at
him
as
she
said
tome
to
tee
ze
yady
zoo
mek
her
peak
what
zoo
do
to
her
tiss
her
you
like
to
be
kissed
bessie
said
bessie
immediately
ducking
down
her
head
very
low
in
resistance
to
the
expected
rejoinder
got
two
pups
said
young
daniel
emboldened
by
observing
the
gentleman
amenities
towards
bessie
i
show
yer
one
got
white
spots
let
me
see
them
daniel
ran
out
and
presently
reappeared
with
two
blind
puppies
eagerly
followed
by
the
mother
affectionate
though
mongrel
and
an
exciting
scene
was
beginning
when
dorcas
returned
and
said
niver
any
difference
in
her
hardly
i
think
you
need
wait
sir
she
lies
very
still
as
she
does
i
put
two
candle
i
the
room
so
as
she
may
see
you
well
you
please
t
excuse
the
room
sir
an
the
cap
as
she
has
on
it
one
o
mine
gilfil
nodded
silently
and
rose
to
follow
her
they
turned
in
at
the
first
door
their
footsteps
making
little
noise
on
the
plaster
floor
the
linen
curtains
were
drawn
at
the
head
of
the
bed
and
dorcas
had
placed
the
candles
on
this
side
of
the
room
so
that
the
light
might
not
fall
oppressively
on
caterina
eyes
when
she
had
opened
the
door
dorcas
whispered
better
leave
you
sir
i
think
gilfil
motioned
assent
and
advanced
beyond
the
curtain
caterina
lay
with
her
eyes
turned
the
other
way
and
seemed
unconscious
that
any
one
had
entered
her
eyes
as
dorcas
had
said
looked
larger
than
ever
perhaps
because
her
face
was
thinner
and
paler
and
her
hair
quite
gathered
away
under
one
of
dorcas
thick
caps
the
small
hands
too
that
lay
listlessly
on
the
outside
of
the
were
thinner
than
ever
she
looked
younger
than
she
really
was
and
any
one
seeing
the
tiny
face
and
hands
for
the
first
time
might
have
thought
they
belonged
to
a
little
girl
of
twelve
who
was
being
taken
away
from
coming
instead
of
past
sorrow
when
gilfil
advanced
and
stood
opposite
to
her
the
light
fell
full
upon
his
face
a
slight
startled
expression
came
over
caterina
eyes
she
looked
at
him
earnestly
for
a
few
moments
then
lifted
up
her
hand
as
if
to
beckon
him
to
stoop
down
towards
her
and
whispered
he
seated
himself
on
the
bed
and
stooped
down
towards
her
she
whispered
again
did
you
see
the
dagger
he
followed
his
first
impulse
in
answering
her
and
it
was
a
wise
one
he
whispered
found
it
in
your
pocket
and
put
it
back
again
in
the
cabinet
he
took
her
hand
in
his
and
held
it
gently
awaiting
what
she
would
say
next
his
heart
swelled
so
with
thankfulness
that
she
had
recognized
him
he
could
hardly
repress
a
sob
gradually
her
eyes
became
softer
and
less
intense
in
their
gaze
the
tears
were
slowly
gathering
and
presently
some
large
hot
drops
rolled
down
her
cheek
then
the
were
opened
and
the
stream
gushed
forth
deep
sobs
came
and
for
nearly
an
hour
she
lay
without
speaking
while
the
heavy
icy
pressure
that
withheld
her
misery
from
utterance
was
thus
melting
away
how
precious
these
tears
were
to
maynard
who
day
after
day
had
been
shuddering
at
the
continually
recurring
image
of
tina
with
the
dry
scorching
stare
of
insanity
by
degrees
the
sobs
subsided
she
began
to
breathe
calmly
and
lay
quiet
with
her
eyes
shut
patiently
maynard
sat
not
heeding
the
flight
of
the
hours
not
heeding
the
old
clock
that
ticked
loudly
on
the
landing
but
when
it
was
nearly
ten
dorcas
impatiently
anxious
to
know
the
result
of
gilfil
appearance
could
not
help
stepping
in
on
without
moving
he
whispered
in
her
ear
to
supply
him
with
candles
see
that
the
had
shaken
down
his
mare
and
go
to
bed
he
would
watch
with
caterina
a
great
change
had
come
over
her
before
long
tina
lips
began
to
move
she
whispered
again
he
leaned
towards
her
and
she
went
on
know
how
wicked
i
am
then
you
know
what
i
meant
to
do
with
the
dagger
you
mean
to
kill
yourself
tina
she
shook
her
head
slowly
and
then
was
silent
for
a
long
while
at
last
looking
at
him
with
solemn
eyes
she
whispered
kill
my
loved
one
you
would
never
have
done
it
god
saw
your
whole
heart
he
knows
you
would
never
harm
a
living
thing
he
watches
over
his
children
and
will
not
let
them
do
things
they
would
pray
with
their
whole
hearts
not
to
do
it
was
the
angry
thought
of
a
moment
and
he
forgives
you
she
sank
into
silence
again
till
it
was
nearly
midnight
the
weary
enfeebled
spirit
seemed
to
be
making
its
slow
way
with
difficulty
through
the
windings
of
thought
and
when
she
began
to
whisper
again
it
was
in
reply
to
maynard
words
i
had
had
such
wicked
feelings
for
a
long
while
i
was
so
angry
and
i
hated
miss
assher
so
and
i
did
care
what
came
to
anybody
because
i
was
so
miserable
myself
i
was
full
of
bad
passions
no
one
else
was
ever
so
wicked
tina
many
are
just
as
wicked
i
often
have
very
wicked
feelings
and
am
tempted
to
do
wrong
things
but
then
my
body
is
stronger
than
yours
and
i
can
hide
my
feelings
and
resist
them
better
they
do
not
master
me
so
you
have
seen
the
little
birds
when
they
are
very
young
and
just
begin
to
fly
how
all
their
feathers
are
ruffled
when
they
are
frightened
or
angry
they
have
no
power
over
themselves
left
and
might
fall
into
a
pit
from
mere
fright
you
were
like
one
of
those
little
birds
your
sorrow
and
suffering
had
taken
such
hold
of
you
you
hardly
knew
what
you
did
he
would
not
speak
long
lest
he
should
tire
her
and
oppress
her
with
too
many
thoughts
long
pauses
seemed
needful
for
her
before
she
could
concentrate
her
feelings
in
short
words
when
i
meant
to
do
it
was
the
next
thing
she
whispered
was
as
bad
as
if
i
had
done
it
my
tina
answered
maynard
slowly
waiting
a
little
between
each
sentence
mean
to
do
wicked
things
that
we
never
could
do
just
as
we
mean
to
do
good
or
clever
things
that
we
never
could
do
our
thoughts
are
often
worse
than
we
are
just
as
they
are
often
better
than
we
are
and
god
sees
us
as
we
are
altogether
not
in
separate
feelings
or
actions
as
our
see
us
we
are
always
doing
each
other
injustice
and
thinking
better
or
worse
of
each
other
than
we
deserve
because
we
only
hear
and
see
separate
words
and
actions
we
do
see
each
other
whole
nature
but
god
sees
that
you
could
not
have
committed
that
crime
caterina
shook
her
head
slowly
and
was
silent
after
a
while
know
she
said
seemed
to
see
him
coming
towards
me
just
as
he
would
really
have
looked
and
i
meant
i
meant
to
do
it
when
you
saw
him
tell
me
how
it
was
tina
saw
him
lying
on
the
ground
and
thought
he
was
ill
i
do
know
how
it
was
then
i
forgot
everything
i
knelt
down
and
spoke
to
him
and
and
he
took
no
notice
of
me
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
and
i
began
to
think
he
was
dead
you
have
never
felt
angry
since
no
no
it
is
i
who
have
been
more
wicked
than
any
one
it
is
i
who
have
been
wrong
all
through
tina
the
fault
has
not
all
been
yours
was
wrong
he
gave
you
provocation
and
wrong
makes
wrong
when
people
use
us
ill
we
can
hardly
help
having
ill
feeling
towards
them
but
that
second
wrong
is
more
excusable
i
am
more
sinful
than
you
tina
i
have
often
had
very
bad
feelings
towards
captain
wybrow
and
if
he
had
provoked
me
as
he
did
you
i
should
perhaps
have
done
something
more
wicked
it
was
not
so
wrong
in
him
he
did
know
how
he
hurt
me
how
was
it
likely
he
could
love
me
as
i
loved
him
and
how
could
he
marry
a
poor
little
thing
like
me
maynard
made
no
reply
to
this
and
there
was
again
silence
till
tina
said
i
was
so
deceitful
they
did
know
how
wicked
i
was
padroncello
did
know
his
good
little
monkey
he
used
to
call
me
and
if
he
had
known
o
how
naughty
he
would
have
thought
me
tina
we
have
all
our
secret
sins
and
if
we
knew
ourselves
we
should
not
judge
each
other
harshly
sir
christopher
himself
has
felt
since
this
trouble
came
upon
him
that
he
has
been
too
severe
and
obstinate
in
this
way
in
these
broken
confessions
and
answering
words
of
comfort
the
hours
wore
on
from
the
deep
black
night
to
the
chill
early
twilight
and
from
early
twilight
to
the
first
yellow
streak
of
morning
parting
the
purple
cloud
gilfil
felt
as
if
in
the
long
hours
of
that
night
the
bond
that
united
his
love
for
ever
and
alone
to
caterina
had
acquired
fresh
strength
and
sanctity
it
is
so
with
the
human
relations
that
rest
on
the
deep
emotional
sympathy
of
affection
every
new
day
and
night
of
joy
or
sorrow
is
a
new
ground
a
new
consecration
for
the
love
that
is
nourished
by
memories
as
well
as
hopes
the
love
to
which
perpetual
repetition
is
not
a
weariness
but
a
want
and
to
which
a
separated
joy
is
the
beginning
of
pain
the
cocks
began
to
crow
the
gate
swung
there
was
a
tramp
of
footsteps
in
the
yard
and
gilfil
heard
dorcas
stirring
these
sounds
seemed
to
affect
caterina
for
she
looked
anxiously
at
him
and
said
are
you
going
away
i
shall
stay
here
at
callam
until
you
are
better
and
then
you
will
go
away
too
to
the
manor
again
o
no
i
shall
live
poorly
and
get
my
own
bread
dearest
you
shall
do
what
you
would
like
best
but
i
wish
you
could
go
to
sleep
now
try
to
rest
quietly
and
you
will
perhaps
sit
up
a
little
god
has
kept
you
in
life
in
spite
of
all
this
sorrow
it
will
be
sinful
not
to
try
and
make
the
best
of
his
gift
dear
tina
you
will
try
and
little
bessie
brought
you
some
crocuses
once
you
did
notice
the
poor
little
thing
but
you
notice
her
when
she
comes
again
will
you
not
will
try
whispered
tina
humbly
and
then
closed
her
eyes
by
the
time
the
sun
was
above
the
horizon
scattering
the
clouds
and
shining
with
pleasant
morning
warmth
through
the
little
leaded
window
caterina
was
asleep
maynard
gently
loosed
the
tiny
hand
cheered
dorcas
with
the
good
news
and
made
his
way
to
the
village
inn
with
a
thankful
heart
that
tina
had
been
so
far
herself
again
evidently
the
sight
of
him
had
blended
naturally
with
the
memories
in
which
her
mind
was
absorbed
and
she
had
been
led
on
to
an
unburthening
of
herself
that
might
be
the
beginning
of
a
complete
restoration
but
her
body
was
so
enfeebled
her
soul
so
bruised
that
the
utmost
tenderness
and
care
would
be
necessary
the
next
thing
to
be
done
was
to
send
tidings
to
sir
christopher
and
lady
cheverel
then
to
write
and
summon
his
sister
under
whose
care
he
had
determined
to
place
caterina
the
manor
even
if
she
had
been
wishing
to
return
thither
would
he
knew
be
the
most
undesirable
home
for
her
at
present
every
scene
every
object
there
was
associated
with
still
unallayed
anguish
if
she
were
domesticated
for
a
time
with
his
mild
gentle
sister
who
had
a
peaceful
home
and
a
prattling
little
boy
tina
might
attach
herself
anew
to
life
and
recover
partly
at
least
the
shock
that
had
been
given
to
her
constitution
when
he
had
written
his
letters
and
taken
a
hasty
breakfast
he
was
soon
in
his
saddle
again
on
his
way
to
sloppeter
where
he
would
post
them
and
seek
out
a
medical
man
to
whom
he
might
confide
the
moral
causes
of
caterina
enfeebled
condition
chapter
in
less
than
a
week
from
that
time
caterina
was
persuaded
to
travel
in
a
comfortable
carriage
under
the
care
of
gilfil
and
his
sister
heron
whose
soft
blue
eyes
and
mild
manners
were
very
soothing
to
the
poor
bruised
child
the
more
so
as
they
had
an
air
of
sisterly
equality
which
was
quite
new
to
her
under
lady
cheverel
uncaressing
authoritative
goodwill
tina
had
always
retained
a
certain
constraint
and
awe
and
there
was
a
sweetness
before
unknown
in
having
a
young
and
gentle
woman
like
an
elder
sister
bending
over
her
caressingly
and
speaking
in
low
loving
tones
maynard
was
almost
angry
with
himself
for
feeling
happy
while
tina
mind
and
body
were
still
trembling
on
the
verge
of
irrecoverable
decline
but
the
new
delight
of
acting
as
her
guardian
angel
of
being
with
her
every
hour
of
the
day
of
devising
everything
for
her
comfort
of
watching
for
a
ray
of
returning
interest
in
her
eyes
was
too
absorbing
to
leave
room
for
alarm
or
regret
on
the
third
day
the
carriage
drove
up
to
the
door
of
foxholm
parsonage
where
the
rev
arthur
heron
presented
himself
on
the
eager
to
greet
his
returning
lucy
and
holding
by
the
hand
a
boy
of
five
who
was
smacking
a
miniature
with
great
vigour
nowhere
was
there
a
lawn
more
walks
better
swept
or
a
porch
more
prettily
festooned
with
creepers
than
at
foxholm
parsonage
standing
snugly
sheltered
by
beeches
and
chestnuts
down
the
pretty
green
hill
which
was
surmounted
by
the
church
and
overlooking
a
village
that
straggled
at
its
ease
among
pastures
and
meadows
surrounded
by
wild
hedgerows
and
broad
shadowing
trees
as
yet
unthreatened
by
improved
methods
of
farming
brightly
the
fire
shone
in
the
great
parlour
and
brightly
in
the
little
pink
bedroom
which
was
to
be
caterina
because
it
looked
away
from
the
churchyard
and
on
to
a
farm
homestead
with
its
little
cluster
of
beehive
ricks
and
placid
groups
of
cows
and
cheerful
matin
sounds
of
healthy
labour
heron
with
the
instinct
of
a
delicate
impressible
woman
had
written
to
her
husband
to
have
this
room
prepared
for
caterina
contented
speckled
hens
industriously
scratching
for
the
corn
may
sometimes
do
more
for
a
sick
heart
than
a
grove
of
nightingales
there
is
something
irresistibly
calming
in
the
unsentimental
cheeriness
of
pullets
unpetted
and
patient
enjoying
a
drink
of
muddy
water
in
such
a
home
as
this
parsonage
a
nest
of
comfort
without
any
of
the
stateliness
that
would
carry
a
suggestion
of
cheverel
manor
gilfil
was
not
unreasonable
in
hoping
that
caterina
might
gradually
shake
off
the
haunting
vision
of
the
past
and
recover
from
the
languor
and
feebleness
which
were
the
physical
sign
of
that
vision
blighting
presence
the
next
thing
to
be
done
was
to
arrange
an
exchange
of
duties
with
heron
curate
that
maynard
might
be
constantly
near
caterina
and
watch
over
her
progress
she
seemed
to
like
him
to
be
with
her
to
look
uneasily
for
his
return
and
though
she
seldom
spoke
to
him
she
was
most
contented
when
he
sat
by
her
and
held
her
tiny
hand
in
his
large
protecting
grasp
but
oswald
ozzy
the
boy
was
perhaps
her
most
beneficial
companion
with
something
of
his
person
he
had
inherited
also
his
uncle
early
taste
for
a
domestic
menagerie
and
was
very
imperative
in
demanding
tina
sympathy
in
the
welfare
of
his
squirrels
and
dormice
with
him
she
seemed
now
and
then
to
have
gleams
of
her
childhood
coming
athwart
the
leaden
clouds
and
many
hours
of
winter
went
by
the
more
easily
for
being
spent
in
ozzy
nursery
heron
was
not
musical
and
had
no
instrument
but
one
of
gilfil
cares
was
to
procure
a
harpsichord
and
have
it
placed
in
the
always
open
in
the
hope
that
some
day
the
spirit
of
music
would
be
reawakened
in
caterina
and
she
would
be
attracted
towards
the
instrument
but
the
winter
was
almost
gone
by
and
he
had
waited
in
vain
the
utmost
improvement
in
tina
had
not
gone
beyond
passiveness
and
acquiescence
a
quiet
grateful
smile
compliance
with
oswald
whims
and
an
increasing
consciousness
of
what
was
being
said
and
done
around
her
sometimes
she
would
take
up
a
bit
of
woman
work
but
she
seemed
too
languid
to
persevere
in
it
her
fingers
soon
dropped
and
she
relapsed
into
motionless
reverie
at
last
it
was
one
of
those
bright
days
in
the
end
of
february
when
the
sun
is
shining
with
a
promise
of
approaching
spring
maynard
had
been
walking
with
her
and
oswald
round
the
garden
to
look
at
the
snowdrops
and
she
was
resting
on
the
sofa
after
the
walk
ozzy
roaming
about
the
room
in
quest
of
a
forbidden
pleasure
came
to
the
harpsichord
and
struck
the
handle
of
his
whip
on
a
deep
bass
note
the
vibration
rushed
through
caterina
like
an
electric
shock
it
seemed
as
if
at
that
instant
a
new
soul
were
entering
into
her
and
filling
her
with
a
deeper
more
significant
life
she
looked
round
rose
from
the
sofa
and
walked
to
the
harpsichord
in
a
moment
her
fingers
were
wandering
with
their
old
sweet
method
among
the
keys
and
her
soul
was
floating
in
its
true
familiar
element
of
delicious
sound
as
the
that
lies
withered
and
shrunken
on
the
ground
expands
into
freedom
and
beauty
when
once
more
bathed
in
its
native
flood
maynard
thanked
god
an
active
power
was
and
must
make
a
new
epoch
in
caterina
recovery
presently
there
were
low
liquid
notes
blending
themselves
with
the
harder
tones
of
the
instrument
and
gradually
the
pure
voice
swelled
into
predominance
little
ozzy
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
legs
very
wide
apart
struck
with
something
like
awe
at
this
new
power
in
as
he
called
her
whom
he
had
been
accustomed
to
think
of
as
a
playfellow
not
at
all
clever
and
very
much
in
need
of
his
instruction
on
many
subjects
a
genie
soaring
with
broad
wings
out
of
his
milkjug
would
not
have
been
more
astonishing
caterina
was
singing
the
very
air
from
the
which
we
heard
her
singing
so
many
months
ago
at
the
beginning
of
her
sorrows
it
was
sir
christopher
favourite
and
its
notes
seemed
to
carry
on
their
wings
all
the
tenderest
memories
of
her
life
when
cheverel
manor
was
still
an
untroubled
home
the
long
happy
days
of
childhood
and
girlhood
recovered
all
their
rightful
predominance
over
the
short
interval
of
sin
and
sorrow
she
paused
and
burst
into
tears
the
first
tears
she
had
shed
since
she
had
been
at
foxholm
maynard
could
not
help
hurrying
towards
her
putting
his
arm
round
her
and
leaning
down
to
kiss
her
hair
she
nestled
to
him
and
put
up
her
little
mouth
to
be
kissed
the
plant
must
have
something
to
cling
to
the
soul
that
was
born
anew
to
music
was
born
anew
to
love
chapter
on
the
of
may
a
very
pretty
sight
was
seen
by
the
villagers
assembled
near
the
door
of
foxholm
church
the
sun
was
bright
upon
the
dewy
grass
the
air
was
alive
with
the
murmur
of
bees
and
the
trilling
of
birds
the
bushy
blossoming
chestnuts
and
the
foamy
flowering
hedgerows
seemed
to
be
crowding
round
to
learn
why
the
were
ringing
so
merrily
as
maynard
gilfil
his
face
bright
with
happiness
walked
out
of
the
old
gothic
doorway
with
tina
on
his
arm
the
little
face
was
still
pale
and
there
was
a
subdued
melancholy
in
it
as
of
one
who
sups
with
friends
for
the
last
time
and
has
his
ear
open
for
the
signal
that
will
call
him
away
but
the
tiny
hand
rested
with
the
pressure
of
contented
affection
on
maynard
arm
and
the
dark
eyes
met
his
downward
glance
with
timid
answering
love
there
was
no
train
of
bridesmaids
only
pretty
heron
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
young
man
hitherto
unknown
in
foxholm
and
holding
by
the
other
hand
little
ozzy
who
exulted
less
in
his
new
velvet
cap
and
tunic
than
in
the
notion
that
he
was
bridesman
to
last
of
all
came
a
couple
whom
the
villagers
eyed
yet
more
eagerly
than
the
bride
and
bridegroom
a
fine
old
gentleman
who
looked
round
with
keen
glances
that
cowed
the
conscious
scapegraces
among
them
and
a
stately
lady
in
silk
robes
who
must
surely
be
like

a

staffordshire
patriarch
who
leaned
on

and

very
much
on
one
side
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
little
hope
of
the
present
generation
but
would
at
all
events
give
it
the
benefit
of

was
standing
in
a

ready
to
speak
words
of
good
omen
as
the
bride
and
bridegroom
approached
he
had
come
all
the
way
from
cheverel
manor
on
purpose
to
see
miss
tina
happy
once
more
and
would
have
been
in
a
state
of
unmixed
joy
but
for
the
inferiority
of
the
wedding
nosegays
to
what
he
could
have
furnished

the
garden

the

rather
tremulous
words
you
uncle
bates
always
remember
tina
said
the
sweet
low
voice
which
fell
on
bates
ear
for
the
last
time
the
wedding
journey
was
to
be
a
circuitous
route
to
shepperton
where
gilfil
had
been
for
several
months
inducted
as
vicar
this
small
living
had
been
given
him
through
the
interest
of
an
old
friend
who
had
some
claim
on
the
gratitude
of
the
oldinport
family
and
it
was
a
satisfaction
both
to
maynard
and
sir
christopher
that
a
home
to
which
he
might
take
caterina
had
thus
readily
presented
itself
at
a
distance
from
cheverel
manor
for
it
had
never
yet
been
thought
safe
that
she
should
revisit
the
scene
of
her
sufferings
her
health
continuing
too
delicate
to
encourage
the
slightest
risk
of
painful
excitement
in
a
year
or
two
perhaps
by
the
time
old
crichley
the
rector
of
cumbermoor
should
have
left
a
world
of
gout
and
when
caterina
would
very
likely
be
a
happy
mother
maynard
might
safely
take
up
his
abode
at
cumbermoor
and
tina
would
feel
nothing
but
content
at
seeing
a
new
monkey
running
up
and
down
the
gallery
and
gardens
of
the
manor
a
mother
dreads
no
memories
those
shadows
have
all
melted
away
in
the
dawn
of
baby
smile
in
these
hopes
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
tina
nestling
affection
gilfil
tasted
a
few
months
of
perfect
happiness
she
had
come
to
lean
entirely
on
his
love
and
to
find
life
sweet
for
his
sake
her
continual
languor
and
want
of
active
interest
was
a
natural
consequence
of
bodily
feebleness
and
the
prospect
of
her
becoming
a
mother
was
a
new
ground
for
hoping
the
best
but
the
delicate
plant
had
been
too
deeply
bruised
and
in
the
struggle
to
put
forth
a
blossom
it
died
tina
died
and
maynard
gilfil
love
went
with
her
into
deep
silence
for
evermore
epilogue
this
was
gilfil
which
lay
far
back
from
the
time
when
he
sat
worn
and
grey
by
his
lonely
fireside
in
shepperton
vicarage
rich
brown
locks
passionate
love
and
deep
early
sorrow
strangely
different
as
they
seem
from
the
scanty
white
hairs
the
apathetic
content
and
the
unexpectant
quiescence
of
old
age
are
but
part
of
the
same
life
journey
as
the
bright
italian
plains
with
the
sweet
of
their
beckoning
maidens
are
part
of
the
same
day
travel
that
brings
us
to
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
between
the
sombre
rocky
walls
and
among
the
guttural
voices
of
the
valais
to
those
who
were
familiar
only
with
the
vicar
jogging
leisurely
along
on
his
old
chestnut
cob
it
would
perhaps
have
been
hard
to
believe
that
he
had
ever
been
the
maynard
gilfil
who
with
a
heart
full
of
passion
and
tenderness
had
urged
his
black
kitty
to
her
swiftest
gallop
on
the
way
to
callam
or
that
the
old
gentleman
of
caustic
tongue
and
bucolic
tastes
and
sparing
habits
had
known
all
the
deep
secrets
of
devoted
love
had
struggled
through
its
days
and
nights
of
anguish
and
trembled
under
its
unspeakable
joys
and
indeed
the
gilfil
of
those
late
shepperton
days
had
more
of
the
knots
and
ruggedness
of
poor
human
nature
than
there
lay
any
clear
hint
of
in
the
loving
maynard
but
it
is
with
men
as
with
trees
if
you
lop
off
their
finest
branches
into
which
they
were
pouring
their
young
the
wounds
will
be
healed
over
with
some
rough
boss
some
odd
excrescence
and
what
might
have
been
a
grand
tree
expanding
into
liberal
shade
is
but
a
whimsical
misshapen
trunk
many
an
irritating
fault
many
an
unlovely
oddity
has
come
of
a
hard
sorrow
which
has
crushed
and
maimed
the
nature
just
when
it
was
expanding
into
plenteous
beauty
and
the
trivial
erring
life
which
we
visit
with
our
harsh
blame
may
be
but
as
the
unsteady
motion
of
a
man
whose
best
limb
is
withered
and
so
the
dear
old
vicar
though
he
had
something
of
the
knotted
whimsical
character
of
the
poor
lopped
oak
had
yet
been
sketched
out
by
nature
as
a
noble
tree
the
heart
of
him
was
sound
the
grain
was
of
the
finest
and
in
the
man
who
filled
his
pocket
with
for
the
little
children
whose
most
biting
words
were
directed
against
the
evil
doing
of
the
rich
man
and
who
with
all
his
social
pipes
and
slipshod
talk
never
sank
below
the
highest
level
of
his
respect
there
was
the
main
trunk
of
the
same
brave
faithful
tender
nature
that
had
poured
out
the
finest
freshest
forces
of
its
in
a
first
and
only
love
the
love
of
tina
janet
repentance
chapter
said
lawyer
dempster
in
a
loud
rasping
oratorical
tone
struggling
against
chronic
huskiness
long
as
my
maker
grants
me
power
of
voice
and
power
of
intellect
i
will
take
every
legal
means
to
resist
the
introduction
of
demoralizing
methodistical
doctrine
into
this
parish
i
will
not
supinely
suffer
an
insult
to
be
inflicted
on
our
venerable
pastor
who
has
given
us
sound
instruction
for
half
a
century
it
was
very
warm
everywhere
that
evening
but
especially
in
the
bar
of
the
red
lion
at
milby
where
dempster
was
seated
mixing
his
third
glass
of
he
was
a
tall
and
rather
massive
man
and
the
front
half
of
his
large
surface
was
so
well
dredged
with
snuff
that
the
cat
having
inadvertently
come
near
him
had
been
seized
with
a
severe
fit
of
sneezing
an
accident
which
being
cruelly
misunderstood
had
caused
her
to
be
driven
contumeliously
from
the
bar
dempster
habitually
held
his
chin
tucked
in
and
his
head
hanging
forward
weighed
down
perhaps
by
a
preponderant
occiput
and
a
bulging
forehead
between
which
his
coronal
surface
lay
like
a
flat
and
the
only
other
observable
features
were
puffy
cheeks
and
a
protruding
yet
lipless
mouth
of
his
nose
i
can
only
say
that
it
was
snuffy
and
as
dempster
was
never
caught
in
the
act
of
looking
at
anything
in
particular
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
swear
to
the
colour
of
his
eyes
i
not
stick
at
giving
myself
trouble
to
put
down
such
hypocritical
cant
said
tomlinson
the
rich
miller
know
well
enough
what
your
sunday
evening
lectures
are
good
for
for
wenches
to
meet
their
sweethearts
and
brew
mischief
there
work
enough
with
the
as
it
is
such
as
i
never
heard
the
like
of
in
my
time
and
it
all
along
o
your
schooling
and
newfangled
plans
give
me
a
servant
as
can
nayther
read
nor
write
i
say
and
does
know
the
year
o
the
lord
as
she
was
born
in
i
should
like
to
know
what
good
those
sunday
schools
have
done
now
why
the
boys
used
to
go
a
of
a
sunday
morning
and
a
capital
thing
too
ask
any
farmer
and
very
pretty
it
was
to
see
the
strings
o
heggs
hanging
up
in
poor
houses
you
not
see
nowhere
now
said
luke
byles
who
piqued
himself
on
his
reading
and
was
in
the
habit
of
asking
casual
acquaintances
if
they
knew
anything
of
hobbes
is
right
enough
that
the
lower
orders
should
be
instructed
but
this
sectarianism
within
the
church
ought
to
be
put
down
in
point
of
fact
these
evangelicals
are
not
churchmen
at
all
they
no
better
than
presbyterians
what
are
they
inquired
tomlinson
who
often
said
his
father
had
given
him
eddication
and
he
did
care
who
knowed
it
he
could
buy
up
most
o
th
eddicated
men
he
ever
come
across
presbyterians
said
dempster
in
rather
a
louder
tone
than
before
holding
that
every
appeal
for
information
must
naturally
be
addressed
to
him
a
sect
founded
in
the
reign
of
charles
by
a
man
named
john
presbyter
who
hatched
all
the
brood
of
dissenting
vermin
that
crawl
about
in
dirty
alleys
and
circumvent
the
lord
of
the
manor
in
order
to
get
a
few
yards
of
ground
for
their
conventicles
no
dempster
said
luke
byles
out
there
presbyterianism
is
derived
from
the
word
presbyter
meaning
an
elder
contradict
sir
stormed
dempster
say
the
word
presbyterian
is
derived
from
john
presbyter
a
miserable
fanatic
who
wore
a
suit
of
leather
and
went
about
from
town
to
village
and
from
village
to
hamlet
inoculating
the
vulgar
with
the
asinine
virus
of
dissent
byles
that
seems
a
deal
more
likely
said
tomlinson
in
a
conciliatory
tone
apparently
of
opinion
that
history
was
a
process
of
ingenious
guessing
not
a
question
of
likelihood
it
a
known
fact
i
could
fetch
you
my
encyclopaedia
and
show
it
you
this
moment
do
care
a
straw
sir
either
for
you
or
your
encyclopaedia
said
dempster
farrago
of
false
information
of
which
you
picked
up
an
imperfect
copy
in
a
cargo
of
waste
paper
will
you
tell
sir
that
i
do
know
the
origin
of
presbyterianism
i
sir
a
man
known
through
the
county
intrusted
with
the
affairs
of
half
a
score
parishes
while
you
sir
are
ignored
by
the
very
fleas
that
infest
the
miserable
alley
in
which
you
were
bred
a
loud
and
general
laugh
with
better
let
him
alone
byles
not
get
the
better
of
dempster
in
a
hurry
drowned
the
retort
of
the
too
byles
who
white
with
rage
rose
and
walked
out
of
the
bar
meddlesome
upstart
jacobinical
fellow
gentlemen
continued
dempster
was
determined
to
be
rid
of
him
what
does
he
mean
by
thrusting
himself
into
our
company
a
man
with
about
as
much
principle
as
he
has
property
which
to
my
knowledge
is
considerably
less
than
none
an
insolvent
atheist

a
deistical
prater
fit
to
sit
in
the
of

and

greasy
newspaper
fingered
by
tinkers
i
will
not
suffer
in
my
company
a
man
who
speaks
lightly
of
religion
the
signature
of
a
fellow
like
byles
would
be
a
blot
on
our
protest
how
do
you
get
on
with
your
signatures
said
pilgrim
the
doctor
who
had
presented
his
large
person
within
the
bar
while
dempster
was
speaking
pilgrim
had
just
returned
from
one
of
his
long
day
rounds
among
the
in
the
course
of
which
he
had
sat
down
to
two
hearty
meals
that
might
have
been
mistaken
for
dinners
if
he
had
not
declared
them
to
be
and
as
each
snap
had
been
followed
by
a
few
glasses
of
containing
a
less
liberal
proportion
of
water
than
the
articles
he
himself
labelled
with
that
broadly
generic
name
he
was
in
that
condition
which
his
groom
indicated
with
poetic
ambiguity
by
saying
that
had
been
in
the
sunshine
under
these
circumstances
after
a
hard
day
in
which
he
had
really
had
no
regular
meal
it
seemed
a
natural
relaxation
to
step
into
the
bar
of
the
red
lion
where
as
it
was
saturday
evening
he
should
be
sure
to
find
dempster
and
hear
the
latest
news
about
the
protest
against
the
evening
lecture
you
hooked
ben
landor
yet
he
continued
as
he
took
two
chairs
one
for
his
body
and
the
other
for
his
right
leg
said
budd
the
churchwarden
shaking
his
head
landor
has
a
way
of
keeping
himself
neutral
in
everything
and
he
does
like
to
oppose
his
father
old

is
a
regular
tryanite
but
we

dempster
sarcastically

expect
pilgrim
to
sign
he
got
a
dozen
tryanite
livers
under
his
treatment
nothing
like
cant
and
methodism
for
producing
a
superfluity
of
bile
i
thought
as
pratt
had
declared
himself
a
tryanite
we
should
be
sure
to
get
pilgrim
on
our
side
pilgrim
was
not
a
man
to
sit
quiet
under
a
sarcasm
nature
having
endowed
him
with
a
considerable
share
of
wit
in
his
most
sober
moments
he
had
an
impediment
in
his
speech
and
as
copious
stimulated
not
the
speech
but
the
impediment
he
had
time
to
make
his
retort
sufficiently
bitter
to
tell
you
the
truth
budd
he
spluttered
a
report
all
over
the
town
that
deb
traunter
swears
you
shall
take
her
with
you
as
one
of
the
delegates
and
they
say
there
to
be
a
fine
crowd
at
your
door
the
morning
you
start
to
see
the
row
knowing
your
tenderness
for
that
member
of
the
fair
sex
i
thought
you
might
find
it
impossible
to
deny
her
i
hang
back
a
little
from
signing
on
that
account
as
prendergast
might
not
take
the
protest
well
if
deb
traunter
went
with
you
budd
was
a
small
bachelor
of
whose
scandalous
life
had
long
furnished
his
more
moral
neighbours
with
an
joke
he
had
no
other
striking
characteristic
except
that
he
was
a
currier
of
choleric
temperament
so
that
you
might
wonder
why
he
had
been
chosen
as
clergyman
churchwarden
if
i
did
not
tell
you
that
he
had
recently
been
elected
through
dempster
exertions
in
order
that
his
zeal
against
the
threatened
evening
lecture
might
be
backed
by
the
dignity
of
office
come
pilgrim
said
tomlinson
covering
budd
retreat
know
you
like
to
wear
the
crier
coat
green
o
one
side
and
red
o
the
other
you
been
to
hear
tryan
preach
at
paddiford
common
you
know
you
have
be
sure
i
have
and
a
capital
sermon
too
it
a
pity
you
were
not
there
it
was
addressed
to
those
void
of
understanding
no
you
never
catch
me
there
returned
tomlinson
not
in
the
least
stung
preaches
without
book
they
say
just
like
a
dissenter
it
must
be
a
rambling
sort
of
a
concern
not
the
worst
said
dempster
preaches
against
good
works
says
good
works
are
not
necessary
to
salvation
a
sectarian
antinomian
anabaptist
doctrine
tell
a
man
he
is
not
to
be
saved
by
his
works
and
you
open
the
of
all
immorality
you
see
it
in
all
these
canting
innovators
they
all
bad
ones
by
the
sly
drawling
hypocritical
fellows
who
pretend
ginger
is
hot
in
their
mouths
and
cry
down
all
innocent
pleasures
their
hearts
are
all
the
blacker
for
their
sanctimonious
outsides
have
we
been
warned
against
those
who
make
clean
the
outside
of
the
cup
and
the
platter
there
this
tryan
now
he
goes
about
praying
with
old
women
and
singing
with
charity
children
but
what
has
he
really
got
his
eye
on
all
the
while
a
domineering
ambitious
jesuit
gentlemen
all
he
wants
is
to
get
his
foot
far
enough
into
the
parish
to
step
into
crewe
shoes
when
the
old
gentleman
dies
depend
upon
it
whenever
you
see
a
man
pretending
to
be
better
than
his
neighbours
that
man
has
either
some
cunning
end
to
serve
or
his
heart
is
rotten
with
spiritual
pride
as
if
to
guarantee
himself
against
this
awful
sin
dempster
seized
his
glass
of
and
tossed
off
the
contents
with
even
greater
rapidity
than
usual
you
fixed
on
your
third
delegate
yet
said
pilgrim
whose
taste
was
for
detail
rather
than
for
dissertation
the
man
answered
dempster
pointing
to
tomlinson
start
for
elmstoke
rectory
on
tuesday
morning
so
if
you
mean
to
give
us
your
signature
you
must
make
up
your
mind
pretty
quickly
pilgrim
pilgrim
did
not
in
the
least
mean
it
so
he
only
said
wonder
if
tryan
turns
out
too
many
for
you
after
all
he
got
a
tongue
of
his
own
and
has
perhaps
talked
over
prendergast
into
a
determination
to
stand
by
him
little
fear
of
that
said
dempster
in
a
confident
tone
soon
bring
him
round
tryan
has
got
his
match
i
plenty
of
rods
in
pickle
for
tryan
at
this
moment
boots
entered
the
bar
and
put
a
letter
into
the
hands
saying
trower
man
just
come
into
the
yard
wi
a
gig
sir
an
he
brought
this
here
letter
dempster
read
the
letter
and
said
him
to
turn
the
gig
i
be
with
him
in
a
minute
here
run
to
gruby
and
get
this
filled
quick
worse
i
suppose
eh
dempster
wants
you
to
alter
his
will
eh
said
pilgrim
business
business
i
do
know
exactly
what
answered
the
cautious
dempster
rising
deliberately
from
his
chair
thrusting
on
his
hat
and
walking
with
a
slow
but
not
unsteady
step
out
of
the
bar
never
see
dempster
equal
if
i
did
i
be
shot
said
tomlinson
looking
after
the
lawyer
admiringly
he
drunk
the
best
part
of
a
bottle
o
brandy
since
here
we
been
sitting
and
i
bet
a
guinea
when
he
got
to
trower
his
head
be
as
clear
as
mine
he
knows
more
about
law
when
he
drunk
than
all
the
rest
on
when
they
sober
and
other
things
too
besides
law
said
budd
you
notice
how
he
took
up
byles
about
the
presbyterians
bless
your
heart
he
knows
everything
dempster
does
he
studied
very
hard
when
he
was
a
young
man
chapter
the
conversation
just
recorded
is
not
i
am
aware
remarkably
refined
or
witty
but
if
it
had
been
it
could
hardly
have
taken
place
in
milby
when
dempster
flourished
there
and
old
crewe
the
curate
was
yet
alive
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
has
slipped
by
since
then
and
in
the
interval
milby
has
advanced
at
as
rapid
a
pace
as
other
in
her
majesty
dominions
by
this
time
it
has
a
handsome
railway
station
where
the
drowsy
london
traveller
may
look
out
by
the
brilliant
and
see
perfectly
sober
papas
and
husbands
alighting
with
their
leatherbags
after
transacting
their
day
business
at
the
county
town
there
is
a
resident
rector
who
appeals
to
the
consciences
of
his
hearers
with
all
the
immense
advantages
of
a
divine
who
keeps
his
own
carriage
the
church
is
enlarged
by
at
least
five
hundred
sittings
and
the
grammar
school
conducted
on
reformed
principles
has
its
upper
forms
crowded
with
the
genteel
youth
of
milby
the
gentlemen
there
fall
into
no
other
excess
at
than
the
perfectly
and
virtuous
excess
of
stupidity
and
though
the
ladies
are
still
said
sometimes
to
take
too
much
upon
themselves
they
are
never
known
to
take
too
much
in
any
other
way
the
conversation
is
sometimes
quite
literary
for
there
is
a
flourishing
and
many
of
the
younger
ladies
have
carried
their
studies
so
far
as
to
have
forgotten
a
little
german
in
short
milby
is
now
a
refined
moral
and
enlightened
town
no
more
resembling
the
milby
of
former
days
than
the
huge
drab
that
embarrassed
the
ankles
of
our
grandfathers
resembled
the
light
paletot
in
which
we
tread
jauntily
through
the
muddiest
streets
or
than
the
britons
rejoicing
over
a
tankard
in
the
old
sign
of
the
two
travellers
at
milby
resembled
the
gentleman
in
straps
and
high
collars
whom
a
modern
artist
has
represented
as
sipping
the
imaginary
port
of
that
commercial
house
but
pray
reader
dismiss
from
your
mind
all
the
refined
and
fashionable
ideas
associated
with
this
advanced
state
of
things
and
transport
your
imagination
to
a
time
when
milby
had
no
when
the
mail
drove
up
dusty
or
bespattered
to
the
door
of
the
red
lion
when
old
crewe
the
curate
in
a
brown
brutus
wig
delivered
inaudible
sermons
on
a
sunday
and
on
a
imparted
the
education
of
a
gentleman
that
is
to
say
an
arduous
inacquaintance
with
latin
through
the
medium
of
the
eton
grammar
to
three
pupils
in
the
upper
if
you
had
passed
through
milby
on
the
coach
at
that
time
you
would
have
had
no
idea
what
important
people
lived
there
and
how
very
high
a
sense
of
rank
was
prevalent
among
them
it
was
a
town
with
a
strong
smell
of
tanning
up
one
street
and
a
great
shaking
of
up
another
and
even
in
that
focus
of
aristocracy
friar
gate
the
houses
would
not
have
seemed
very
imposing
to
the
hasty
and
superficial
glance
of
a
passenger
you
might
still
less
have
suspected
that
the
figure
in
light
fustian
and
large
grey
whiskers
leaning
against
the
grocer
in
high
street
was
no
less
a
person
than
lowme
one
of
the
most
aristocratic
men
in
milby
said
to
have
been
up
a
gentleman
and
to
have
had
the
gay
habits
accordant
with
that
station
keeping
his
harriers
and
other
expensive
animals
he
was
now
quite
an
elderly
lothario
reduced
to
the
most
economical
sins
the
prominent
form
of
his
gaiety
being
this
of
lounging
at
gruby
door
embarrassing
the
who
came
for
grocery
and
talking
scandal
with
the
rare
still
it
was
generally
understood
that
lowme
belonged
to
the
highest
circle
of
milby
society
his
sons
and
daughters
held
up
their
heads
very
high
indeed
and
in
spite
of
his
condescending
way
of
chatting
and
drinking
with
inferior
people
he
would
himself
have
scorned
any
closer
identification
with
them
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
was
of
some
service
to
the
town
in
this
station
at
gruby
door
for
he
and
landor
newfoundland
dog
who
stretched
himself
and
gaped
on
the
opposite
causeway
took
something
from
the
lifeless
air
that
belonged
to
the
high
street
on
every
day
except
saturday
certainly
in
spite
of
three
assemblies
and
a
charity
ball
in
the
winter
the
occasional
advent
of
a
ventriloquist
or
a
company
of
itinerant
players
some
of
whom
were
very
highly
thought
of
in
london
and
the
annual
fair
in
june
milby
might
be
considered
dull
by
people
of
a
hypochondriacal
temperament
and
perhaps
this
was
one
reason
why
many
of
the
inhabitants
male
and
female
often
found
it
impossible
to
keep
up
their
spirits
without
a
very
abundant
supply
of
stimulants
it
is
true
there
were
several
substantial
men
who
had
a
reputation
for
exceptional
sobriety
so
that
milby
habits
were
really
not
as
bad
as
possible
and
no
one
is
warranted
in
saying
that
old
crewe
flock
could
not
have
been
worse
without
any
clergyman
at
all
the
parishioners
generally
were
very
regular
and
to
the
younger
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
sunday
morning
service
was
the
most
exciting
event
of
the
week
for
few
places
could
present
a
more
brilliant
show
of
toilettes
than
might
be
seen
issuing
from
milby
church
at
one
there
were
the
four
tall
miss
pittmans
old
lawyer
pittman
daughters
with
cannon
curls
surmounted
by
large
hats
and
long
drooping
ostrich
feathers
of
parrot
green
there
was
miss
phipps
with
a
crimson
bonnet
very
much
tilted
up
behind
and
a
cockade
of
stiff
feathers
on
the
summit
there
was
miss
landor
the
belle
of
milby
clad
regally
in
purple
and
ermine
with
a
plume
of
feathers
neither
drooping
nor
erect
but
maintaining
a
discreet
medium
there
were
the
three
miss
tomlinsons
who
imitated
miss
landor
and
also
wore
ermine
and
feathers
but
their
beauty
was
considered
of
a
coarse
order
and
their
square
forms
were
quite
unsuited
to
the
round
tippet
which
fell
with
such
remarkable
grace
on
miss
landor
sloping
shoulders
looking
at
this
plumed
procession
of
ladies
you
would
have
formed
rather
a
high
idea
of
milby
wealth
yet
there
was
only
one
close
carriage
in
the
place
and
that
was
old
landor
the
banker
who
i
think
never
drove
more
than
one
horse
these
ladies
flashed
past
the
vulgar
eye
in
chaises
by
no
means
of
a
superior
build
the
young
gentlemen
too
were
not
without
their
little
sunday
displays
of
costume
of
a
limited
masculine
kind
eustace
landor
being
nearly
of
age
had
recently
acquired
a
diamond
ring
together
with
the
habit
of
rubbing
his
hand
through
his
hair
he
was
tall
and
dark
and
thus
had
an
advantage
which
alfred
phipps
who
like
his
sister
was
blond
and
stumpy
found
it
difficult
to
overtake
even
by
the
severest
attention
to
and
the
particular
shade
of
brown
that
was
best
relieved
by
gilt
buttons
the
respect
for
the
sabbath
manifested
in
this
attention
to
costume
was
unhappily
counterbalanced
by
considerable
levity
of
behaviour
during
the
prayers
and
sermon
for
the
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
milby
were
of
a
very
satirical
turn
miss
landor
especially
being
considered
remarkably
clever
and
a
terrible
quiz
and
the
large
congregation
necessarily
containing
many
persons
inferior
in
dress
and
demeanour
to
the
distinguished
aristocratic
minority
divine
service
offered
irresistible
temptations
to
joking
through
the
medium
of
telegraphic
communications
from
the
galleries
to
the
aisles
and
back
again
i
remember
blushing
very
much
and
thinking
miss
landor
was
laughing
at
me
because
i
was
appearing
in
for
the
first
time
when
i
saw
her
look
down
slyly
towards
where
i
sat
and
then
turn
with
a
titter
to
handsome
bob
lowme
who
had
such
beautiful
whiskers
meeting
under
his
chin
but
perhaps
she
was
not
thinking
of
me
after
all
for
our
pew
was
near
the
pulpit
and
there
was
almost
always
something
funny
about
old
crewe
his
brown
wig
was
hardly
ever
put
on
quite
right
and
he
had
a
way
of
raising
his
voice
for
three
or
four
words
and
lowering
it
again
to
a
mumble
so
that
we
could
scarcely
make
out
a
word
he
said
though
as
my
mother
observed
that
was
of
no
consequence
in
the
prayers
since
every
one
had
a
and
as
for
the
sermon
she
continued
with
some
causticity
we
all
of
us
heard
more
of
it
than
we
could
remember
when
we
got
home
this
youthful
generation
was
not
particularly
literary
the
young
ladies
who
frizzed
their
hair
and
gathered
it
all
into
large
barricades
in
front
of
their
heads
leaving
their
occipital
region
exposed
without
ornament
as
if
that
being
a
back
view
was
of
no
consequence
dreamed
as
little
that
their
daughters
would
read
a
selection
of
german
poetry
and
be
able
to
express
an
admiration
for
schiller
as
that
they
would
turn
all
their
hair
the
other
way
that
instead
of
threatening
us
with
barricades
in
front
they
would
be
most
killing
in
retreat
like
the
parthian
wound
us
as
they
fly
those
charming
ladies
spoke
french
indeed
with
considerable
facility
unshackled
by
any
timid
regard
to
idiom
and
were
in
the
habit
of
conducting
conversations
in
that
language
in
the
presence
of
their
less
instructed
elders
for
according
to
the
standard
of
those
backward
days
their
education
had
been
very
lavish
such
young
ladies
as
miss
landor
miss
phipps
and
the
miss
pittmans
having
been
at
distant
and
expensive
schools
old
lawyer
pittman
had
once
been
a
very
important
person
indeed
having
in
his
earlier
days
managed
the
affairs
of
several
gentlemen
in
those
parts
who
had
subsequently
been
obliged
to
sell
everything
and
leave
the
country
in
which
crisis
pittman
accommodatingly
stepped
in
as
a
purchaser
of
their
estates
taking
on
himself
the
risk
and
trouble
of
a
more
leisurely
sale
which
however
happened
to
turn
out
very
much
to
his
advantage
such
opportunities
occur
quite
unexpectedly
in
the
way
of
business
but
i
think
pittman
must
have
been
unlucky
in
his
later
speculations
for
now
in
his
old
age
he
had
not
the
reputation
of
being
very
rich
and
though
he
rode
slowly
to
his
office
in
milby
every
morning
on
an
old
white
hackney
he
had
to
resign
the
chief
profits
as
well
as
the
active
business
of
the
firm
to
his
younger
partner
dempster
no
one
in
milby
considered
old
pittman
a
virtuous
man
and
the
elder
townspeople
were
not
at
all
backward
in
narrating
the
least
advantageous
portions
of
his
biography
in
a
very
round
unvarnished
manner
yet
i
could
never
observe
that
they
trusted

any
the
less
or
liked

the
worse
indeed
pittman
and
dempster
were
the
popular
lawyers
of
milby
and
its
neighbourhood
and
benjamin
landor
whom
no
one
had
anything
particular
to
say
against
had
a
very
meagre
business
in
comparison
hardly
a
landholder
hardly
a
farmer
hardly
a
parish
within
ten
miles
of
milby
whose
affairs
were
not
under
the
legal
guardianship
of
pittman
and
dempster
and
i
think
the
clients
were
proud
of
their
unscrupulousness
as
the
patrons
of
the
fancy
are
proud
of
their
champion
it
was
not
to
be
sure
the
thing
for
ordinary
life
but
it
was
the
thing
to
be
bet
on
in
a
lawyer
dempster
talent
in
through
a
client
was
a
very
common
topic
of
conversation
with
the
farmers

incidental
glass
of

even
jerome
chief
member
of
the
congregation
at
salem
chapel
an
elderly
man
of
very
strict
life
was
one
of
clients
and
had
quite
an
exceptional
indulgence
for
his
foibles
perhaps
attributing
them
to
the
inevitable
incompatibility
of
law
and
gospel
the
standard
of
morality
at
milby
you
perceive
was
not
inconveniently
high
in
those
good
old
times
and
an
ingenuous
vice
or
two
was
what
every
man
expected
of
his
neighbour
old
crewe
the
curate
for
example
was
allowed
to
enjoy
his
avarice
in
comfort
without
fear
of
sarcastic
parish
demagogues
and
his
flock
liked
him
all
the
better
for
having
scraped
together
a
large
fortune
out
of
his
school
and
curacy
and
the
proceeds
of
the
three
thousand
pounds
he
had
with
his
little
deaf
wife
it
was
clear
he
must
be
a
learned
man
for
he
had
once
had
a
large
private
school
in
connection
with
the
grammar
school
and
had
even
numbered
a
young
nobleman
or
two
among
his
pupils
the
fact
that
he
read
nothing
at
all
now
and
that
his
mind
seemed
absorbed
in
the
commonest
matters
was
doubtless
due
to
his
having
exhausted
the
resources
of
erudition
earlier
in
life
it
is
true
he
was
not
spoken
of
in
terms
of
high
respect
and
old
crewe
stingy
housekeeping
was
a
frequent
subject
of
jesting
but
this
was
a
good
characteristic
in
a
parson
who
had
been
part
of
milby
life
for
half
a
century
it
was
like
the
dents
and
disfigurements
in
an
old
family
tankard
which
no
one
would
like
to
part
with
for
a
smart
new
piece
of
plate
fresh
from
birmingham
the
parishioners
saw
no
reason
at
all
why
it
should
be
desirable
to
venerate
the
parson
or
any
one
else
they
were
much
more
comfortable
to
look
down
a
little
on
their
even
the
dissent
in
milby
was
then
of
a
lax
and
indifferent
kind
the
doctrine
of
adult
baptism
struggling
under
a
heavy
load
of
debt
had
let
off
half
its
chapel
area
as
a
and
methodism
was
only
to
be
detected
as
you
detect
curious
larvae
by
diligent
search
in
dirty
corners
the
independents
were
the
only
dissenters
of
whose
existence
milby
gentility
was
at
all
conscious
and
it
had
a
vague
idea
that
the
salient
points
of
their
creed
were
prayer
without
book
red
brick
and
hypocrisy
the
independent
chapel
known
as
salem
stood
red
and
conspicuous
in
a
broad
street
more
than
one
kept
a
gig
and
jerome
a
retired
and
the
most
eminent
member
of
the
congregation
was
one
of
the
richest
men
in
the
parish
but
in
spite
of
this
apparent
prosperity
together
with
the
usual
amount
of
extemporaneous
preaching
mitigated
by
furtive
notes
salem
belied
its
name
and
was
not
always
the
abode
of
peace
for
some
reason
or
other
it
was
unfortunate
in
the
choice
of
its
ministers
the
rev
horner
elected
with
brilliant
hopes
was
discovered
to
be
given
to
tippling
and
quarrelling
with
his
wife
the
rev
rose
doctrine
was
a
little
too
verging
on
antinomianism
the
rev
gift
as
a
preacher
was
found
to
be
less
striking
on
a
more
extended
acquaintance
and
the
rev
smith
a
distinguished
minister
much
sought
after
in
the
iron
districts
with
a
talent
for
poetry
became
objectionable
from
an
inclination
to
exchange
verses
with
the
young
ladies
of
his
congregation
it
was
reasonably
argued
that
such
verses
as
smith
must
take
a
long
time
for
their
composition
and
the
habit
alluded
to
might
intrench
seriously
on
his
pastoral
duties
these
reverend
gentlemen
one
and
all
gave
it
as
their
opinion
that
the
salem
church
members
were
among
the
least
enlightened
of
the
lord
people
and
that
milby
was
a
low
place
where
they
would
have
found
it
a
severe
lot
to
have
their
lines
fall
for
any
long
period
though
to
see
the
smart
and
crowded
congregation
assembled
on
occasion
of
the
annual
charity
sermon
any
one
might
have
supposed
that
the
minister
of
salem
had
rather
a
brilliant
position
in
the
ranks
of
dissent
several
church
families
used
to
attend
on
that
occasion
for
milby
in
those
uninstructed
days
had
not
yet
heard
that
the
schismatic
ministers
of
salem
were
obviously
typified
by
korah
dathan
and
abiram
and
many
church
people
there
were
of
opinion
that
dissent
might
be
a
weakness
but
after
all
had
no
great
harm
in
it
these
lax
episcopalians
were
i
believe
chiefly
tradespeople
who
held
that
inasmuch
as
congregationalism
consumed
candles
it
ought
to
be
supported
and
accordingly
made
a
point
of
presenting
themselves
at
salem
for
the
afternoon
charity
sermon
with
the
expectation
of
being
asked
to
hold
a
plate
pilgrim
too
was
always
there
with
his
for
as
there
was
no
dissenting
doctor
in
milby
pilgrim
looked
with
great
tolerance
on
all
shades
of
religious
opinion
that
did
not
include
a
belief
in
cures
by
miracle
on
this
point
he
had
the
concurrence
of
pratt
the
only
other
medical
man
of
the
same
standing
in
milby
otherwise
it
was
remarkable
how
strongly
these
two
clever
men
were
contrasted
pratt
was
insinuating
and
pilgrim
was
tall
heavy
and
spluttering
both
were
considered
to
have
great
powers
of
conversation
but
pratt
anecdotes
were
of
the
fine
old
crusted
quality
to
be
procured
only
of
joe
miller
pilgrim
had
the
full
fruity
flavour
of
the
most
recent
scandal
pratt
elegantly
referred
all
diseases
to
debility
and
with
a
proper
contempt
for
symptomatic
treatment
went
to
the
root
of
the
matter
with
port
wine
and
bark
pilgrim
was
persuaded
that
the
evil
principle
in
the
human
system
was
plethora
and
he
made
war
against
it
with
cupping
blistering
and
cathartics
they
had
both
been
long
established
in
milby
and
as
each
had
a
sufficient
practice
there
was
no
very
malignant
rivalry
between
them
on
the
contrary
they
had
that
sort
of
friendly
contempt
for
each
other
which
is
always
conducive
to
a
good
understanding
between
professional
men
and
when
any
new
surgeon
attempted
in
an
hour
to
settle
himself
in
the
town
it
was
strikingly
demonstrated
how
slight
and
trivial
are
theoretic
differences
compared
with
the
broad
basis
of
common
human
feeling
there
was
the
most
perfect
unanimity
between
pratt
and
pilgrim
in
the
determination
to
drive
away
the
obnoxious
and
too
probably
unqualified
intruder
as
soon
as
possible
whether
the
first
wonderful
cure
he
effected
was
on
a
patient
of
pratt
or
of
pilgrim
one
was
as
ready
as
the
other
to
pull
the
interloper
by
the
nose
and
both
alike
directed
their
remarkable
powers
of
conversation
towards
making
the
town
too
hot
for
him
but
by
their
respective
patients
these
two
distinguished
men
were
pitted
against
each
other
with
great
virulence
lowme
could
not
conceal
her
amazement
that
phipps
should
trust
her
life
in
the
hands
of
pratt
who
let
her
feed
herself
up
to
that
degree
it
was
really
shocking
to
hear
how
short
her
breath
was
and
phipps
had
no
patience
with
lowme
living
as
she
did
on
tea
and
broth
and
looking
as
yellow
as
any
and
yet
letting
pilgrim
bleed
and
blister
her
and
give
her
lowering
medicine
till
her
clothes
hung
on
her
like
a
scarecrow
on
the
whole
perhaps
pilgrim
reputation
was
at
the
higher
pitch
and
when
any
lady
under
pratt
care
was
doing
ill
she
was
half
disposed
to
think
that
a
little
more
active
might
suit
her
better
but
without
very
definite
provocation
no
one
would
take
so
serious
a
step
as
to
part
with
the
family
doctor
for
in
those
remote
days
there
were
few
varieties
of
human
hatred
more
formidable
than
the
medical
the
doctor
estimate
even
of
a
confiding
patient
was
apt
to
rise
and
fall
with
the
entries
in
the
and
i
have
known
pilgrim
discover
the
most
unexpected
virtues
in
a
patient
seized
with
a
promising
illness
at
such
times
you
might
have
been
glad
to
perceive
that
there
were
some
of
pilgrim
of
whom
he
entertained
a
high
opinion
and
that
he
was
liable
to
the
amiable
weakness
of
a
too
admiring
estimate
a
good
inflammation
fired
his
enthusiasm
and
a
lingering
dropsy
dissolved
him
into
charity
doubtless
this
of
benevolence
was
partly
due
to
feelings
not
at
all
represented
by
the
entries
in
the
for
in
pilgrim
heart
too
there
was
a
latent
store
of
tenderness
and
pity
which
flowed
forth
at
the
sight
of
suffering
gradually
however
as
his
patients
became
convalescent
his
view
of
their
characters
became
more
dispassionate
when
they
could
relish
he
began
to
admit
that
they
had
foibles
and
by
the
time
they
had
swallowed
their
last
dose
of
tonic
he
was
alive
to
their
most
inexcusable
faults
after
this
the
thermometer
of
his
regard
rested
at
the
moderate
point
of
friendly
which
sufficed
to
make
him
agreeable
in
his
morning
visits
to
the
amiable
and
worthy
persons
who
were
yet
far
from
convalescent
pratt
patients
were
profoundly
uninteresting
to
pilgrim
their
very
diseases
were
despicable
and
he
would
hardly
have
thought
their
bodies
worth
dissecting
but
of
all
pratt
patients
jerome
was
the
one
on
whom
pilgrim
heaped
the
most
unmitigated
contempt
in
spite
of
the
surgeon
wise
tolerance
dissent
became
odious
to
him
in
the
person
of
jerome
perhaps
it
was
because
that
old
gentleman
being
rich
and
having
very
large
yearly
bills
for
medical
attendance
on
himself
and
his
wife
nevertheless
employed
pratt
neglected
all
the
advantages
of
treatment
and
paid
away
his
money
without
getting
his
system
lowered
on
any
other
ground
it
is
hard
to
explain
a
feeling
of
hostility
to
jerome
who
was
an
excellent
old
gentleman
expressing
a
great
deal
of
goodwill
towards
his
neighbours
not
only
in
imperfect
english
but
in
loans
of
money
to
the
ostensibly
rich
and
in
sacks
of
potatoes
to
the
obviously
poor
assuredly
milby
had
that
salt
of
goodness
which
keeps
the
world
together
in
greater
abundance
than
was
visible
on
the
surface
innocent
babes
were
born
there
sweetening
their
parents
hearts
with
simple
joys
men
and
women
withering
in
disappointed
worldliness
or
bloated
with
sensual
ease
had
better
moments
in
which
they
pressed
the
hand
of
suffering
with
sympathy
and
were
moved
to
deeds
of
neighbourly
kindness
in
church
and
in
chapel
there
were
worshippers
who
strove
to
keep
a
conscience
void
of
offence
and
even
up
the
dimmest
alleys
you
might
have
found
here
and
there
a
wesleyan
to
whom
methodism
was
the
vehicle
of
peace
on
earth
and
goodwill
to
men
to
a
superficial
glance
milby
was
nothing
but
dreary
prose
a
dingy
town
surrounded
by
flat
fields
lopped
elms
and
sprawling
manufacturing
villages
which
crept
on
and
on
with
their
till
they
threatened
to
graft
themselves
on
the
town
but
the
sweet
spring
came
to
milby
notwithstanding
the
were
red
with
buds
the
churchyard
was
starred
with
daisies
the
lark
showered
his
on
the
flat
fields
the
rainbows
hung
over
the
dingy
town
clothing
the
very
roofs
and
chimneys
in
a
strange
transfiguring
beauty
and
so
it
was
with
the
human
life
there
which
at
first
seemed
a
dismal
mixture
of
griping
worldliness
vanity
ostrich
feathers
and
the
fumes
of
brandy
looking
closer
you
found
some
purity
gentleness
and
unselfishness
as
you
may
have
observed
a
scented
geranium
giving
forth
its
wholesome
odours
amidst
blasphemy
and
gin
in
a
noisy
little
deaf
crewe
would
often
carry
half
her
own
spare
dinner
to
the
sick
and
hungry
miss
phipps
with
her
cockade
of
red
feathers
had
a
filial
heart
and
lighted
her
father
pipe
with
a
pleasant
smile
and
there
were
men
in
drab
gaiters
not
at
all
noticeable
as
you
passed
them
in
the
street
whose
integrity
had
been
the
basis
of
their
rich
neighbour
wealth
such
as
the
place
was
the
people
there
were
entirely
contented
with
it
they
fancied
life
must
be
but
a
dull
affair
for
that
large
portion
of
mankind
who
were
necessarily
shut
out
from
an
acquaintance
with
milby
families
and
that
it
must
be
an
advantage
to
london
and
liverpool
that
milby
gentlemen
occasionally
visited
those
places
on
business
but
the
inhabitants
became
more
intensely
conscious
of
the
value
they
set
upon
all
their
advantages
when
innovation
made
its
appearance
in
the
person
of
the
rev
tryan
the
new
curate
at
the
on
paddiford
common
it
was
soon
notorious
in
milby
that
tryan
held
peculiar
opinions
that
he
preached
extempore
that
he
was
founding
a
religious
lending
library
in
his
remote
corner
of
the
parish
that
he
expounded
the
scriptures
in
cottages
and
that
his
preaching
was
attracting
the
dissenters
and
filling
the
very
aisles
of
his
church
the
rumour
sprang
up
that
evangelicalism
had
invaded
milby
parish
a
murrain
or
blight
all
the
more
terrible
because
its
nature
was
but
dimly
conjectured
perhaps
milby
was
one
of
the
last
spots
to
be
reached
by
the
wave
of
a
new
movement
and
it
was
only
now
when
the
tide
was
just
on
the
turn
that
the
limpets
there
got
a
sprinkling
tryan
was
the
first
evangelical
clergyman
who
had
risen
above
the
milby
horizon
hitherto
that
obnoxious
adjective
had
been
unknown
to
the
townspeople
of
any
gentility
and
there
were
even
many
dissenters
who
considered
simply
a
sort
of
baptismal
name
to
the
magazine
which
circulated
among
the
congregation
of
salem
chapel
but
now
at
length
the
disease
had
been
imported
when
the
parishioners
were
expecting
it
as
little
as
the
innocent
red
indians
expected
smallpox
as
long
as
tryan
hearers
were
confined
to
paddiford
common
which
by
the
by
was
hardly
recognizable
as
a
common
at
all
but
was
a
dismal
district
where
you
heard
the
rattle
of
the
handloom
and
breathed
the
smoke
of
the
parson
could
be
treated
as
a
joke
not
so
when
a
number
of
single
ladies
in
the
town
appeared
to
be
infected
and
even
one
or
two
men
of
substantial
property
with
old
landor
the
banker
at
their
head
seemed
to
be
to
the
new
movement
when
tryan
was
known
to
be
well
received
in
several
good
houses
where
he
was
in
the
habit
of
finishing
the
evening
with
exhortation
and
prayer
evangelicalism
was
no
longer
a
nuisance
existing
merely
in
which
any
person
could
avoid
it
was
invading
the
very
mingling
itself
with
the
comfortable
fumes
of
and
brandy
threatening
to
deaden
with
its
murky
breath
all
the
splendour
of
the
ostrich
feathers
and
to
stifle
milby
ingenuousness
not
pretending
to
be
better
than
its
neighbours
with
a
cloud
of
cant
and
lugubrious
hypocrisy
the
alarm
reached
its
climax
when
it
was
reported
that
tryan
was
endeavouring
to
obtain
authority
from
prendergast
the
rector
to
establish
a
sunday
evening
lecture
in
the
parish
church
on
the
ground
that
old
crewe
did
not
preach
the
gospel
it
now
first
appeared
how
surprisingly
high
a
value
milby
in
general
set
on
the
ministrations
of
crewe
how
convinced
it
was
that
crewe
was
the
model
of
a
parish
priest
and
his
sermons
the
soundest
and
most
edifying
that
had
ever
remained
unheard
by
a
population
all
allusions
to
his
brown
wig
were
suppressed
and
by
a
rhetorical
figure
his
name
was
associated
with
venerable
grey
hairs
the
attempted
intrusion
of
tryan
was
an
insult
to
a
man
deep
in
years
and
learning
moreover
it
was
an
insolent
effort
to
thrust
himself
forward
in
a
parish
where
he
was
clearly
distasteful
to
the
superior
portion
of
its
inhabitants
the
town
was
divided
into
two
zealous
parties
the
tryanites
and
and
by
the
exertions
of
the
eloquent
dempster
the
virulence
was
soon
developed
into
an
organized
opposition
a
protest
against
the
meditated
evening
lecture
was
framed
by
that
orthodox
attorney
and
after
being
numerously
signed
was
to
be
carried
to
prendergast
by
three
delegates
representing
the
intellect
morality
and
wealth
of
milby
the
intellect
you
perceive
was
to
be
personified
in
dempster
the
morality
in
budd
and
the
wealth
in
tomlinson
and
the
distinguished
triad
was
to
set
out
on
its
great
mission
as
we
have
seen
on
the
third
day
from
that
warm
saturday
evening
when
the
conversation
recorded
in
the
previous
chapter
took
place
in
the
bar
of
the
red
lion
chapter
it
was
quite
as
warm
on
the
following
thursday
evening
when
dempster
and
his
colleagues
were
to
return
from
their
mission
to
elmstoke
rectory
but
it
was
much
pleasanter
in
linnet
parlour
than
in
the
bar
of
the
red
lion
through
the
open
window
came
the
scent
of
mignonette
and
honeysuckle
the
in
front
of
the
house
was
shaded
by
a
little
plantation
of
gueldres
roses
syringas
and
laburnums
the
noise
of
looms
and
carts
and
unmelodious
voices
reached
the
ear
simply
as
an
agreeable
murmur
for
linnet
house
was
situated
quite
on
the
outskirts
of
paddiford
common
and
the
only
sound
likely
to
disturb
the
serenity
of
the
feminine
party
assembled
there
was
the
occasional
buzz
of
intrusive
wasps
apparently
mistaking
each
lady
head
for
a
no
was
visible
in
linnet
parlour
for
the
time
of
tea
was
not
yet
and
the
round
table
was
littered
with
books
which
the
ladies
were
covering
with
black
canvass
as
a
reinforcement
of
the
new
paddiford
lending
library
miss
linnet
whose
manuscript
was
the
neatest
type
of
zigzag
was
seated
at
a
small
table
apart
writing
on
green
paper
tickets
which
were
to
be
pasted
on
the
covers
miss
linnet
had
other
accomplishments
besides
that
of
a
neat
manuscript
and
an
index
to
some
of
them
might
be
found
in
the
ornaments
of
the
room
she
had
always
combined
a
love
of
serious
and
poetical
reading
with
her
skill
in
and
the
copies
of
dryden
hannah
more
dramas
falconer
mason
and
burke
the
sublime
and
beautiful
which
were
the
chief
ornaments
of
the
bookcase
were
all
inscribed
with
her
name
and
had
been
bought
with
her
when
she
was
in
her
teens
it
must
have
been
at
least
fifteen
years
since
the
latest
of
those
purchases
but
miss
linnet
skill
in
appeared
to
have
gone
through
more
numerous
phases
than
her
literary
taste
for
the
japanned
boxes
the
alum
and
baskets
the
the
landscapes
on
the
and
the
recent
bouquets
of
showed
a
disparity
in
freshness
which
made
them
referable
to
widely
different
periods
presuppose
delicate
fingers
and
robust
patience
but
there
are
still
many
points
of
mind
and
person
which
they
leave
vague
and
problematic
so
i
must
tell
you
that
miss
linnet
had
dark
ringlets
a
sallow
complexion
and
an
amiable
disposition
as
to
her
features
there
was
not
much
to
criticize
in
them
for
she
had
little
nose
less
lip
and
no
eyebrow
and
as
to
her
intellect
her
friend
pettifer
often
said
did
know
a
more
sensible
person
to
talk
to
than
mary
linnet
there
was
no
one
she
liked
better
to
come
and
take
a
quiet
cup
of
tea
with
her
and
read
a
little
of
klopstock
mary
linnet
had
often
told
her
a
great
deal
of
her
mind
when
they
were
sitting
together
she
said
there
were
many
things
to
bear
in
every
condition
of
life
and
nothing
should
induce
her
to
marry
without
a
prospect
of
happiness
once
when
pettifer
admired
her
she
said
ah
pettifer
think
of
the
beauties
of
nature
she
always
spoke
very
prettily
did
mary
linnet
very
different
indeed
from
rebecca
miss
rebecca
linnet
indeed
was
not
a
general
favourite
while
most
people
thought
it
a
pity
that
a
sensible
woman
like
mary
had
not
found
a
good
husband
and
even
her
female
friends
said
nothing
more
of
her
than
that
her
face
was
like
a
piece
of
putty
with
two
scotch
pebbles
stuck
in
it
rebecca
was
always
spoken
of
sarcastically
and
it
was
a
customary
kind
of
banter
with
young
ladies
to
recommend
her
as
a
wife
to
any
gentleman
they
happened
to
be
flirting
with
her
fat
her
finery
and
her
thick
ankles
sufficing
to
give
piquancy
to
the
joke
notwithstanding
the
absence
of
novelty
miss
rebecca
however
possessed
the
accomplishment
of
music
and
her
singing
of
no
we
never
mention
her
and
soldier
tear
was
so
desirable
an
accession
to
the
pleasures
of
a
that
no
one
cared
to
offend
her
especially
as
rebecca
had
a
high
spirit
of
her
own
and
in
spite
of
her
expansively
rounded
contour
had
a
particularly
sharp
tongue
her
reading
had
been
more
extensive
than
her
sister
embracing
most
of
the
fiction
in
procter
circulating
library
and
nothing
but
an
acquaintance
with
the
course
of
her
studies
could
afford
a
clue
to
the
rapid
transitions
in
her
dress
which
were
suggested
by
the
style
of
beauty
whether
sentimental
sprightly
or
severe
possessed
by
the
heroine
of
the
three
volumes
actually
in
perusal
a
piece
of
lace
which
drooped
round
the
edge
of
her
white
bonnet
one
week
had
been
rejected
by
the
next
and
her
cheeks
which
on
whitsunday
loomed
through
a
turnerian
haze
of
network
were
on
trinity
sunday
seen
reposing
in
distinct
red
outline
on
her
shelving
bust
like
the
sun
on
a
the
black
velvet
meeting
with
a
crystal
clasp
which
one
evening
encircled
her
head
had
on
another
descended
to
her
neck
and
on
a
third
to
her
waist
suggesting
to
an
active
imagination
either
a
magical
contraction
of
the
ornament
or
a
fearful
ratio
of
expansion
in
miss
rebecca
person
with
this
constant
application
of
art
to
dress
she
could
have
had
little
time
for
even
if
she
had
not
been
destitute
of
her
sister
taste
for
that
delightful
and
truly
feminine
occupation
and
here
at
least
you
perceive
the
justice
of
the
milby
opinion
as
to
the
relative
suitability
of
the
two
miss
linnets
for
matrimony
when
a
man
is
happy
enough
to
win
the
affections
of
a
sweet
girl
who
can
soothe
his
cares
with
and
respond
to
all
his
most
cherished
ideas
with
beaded
and
in
german
wool
he
has
at
least
a
guarantee
of
domestic
comfort
whatever
trials
may
await
him
out
of
doors
what
a
resource
it
is
under
fatigue
and
irritation
to
have
your
well
supplied
with
small
mats
which
would
always
be
ready
if
you
ever
wanted
to
set
anything
on
them
and
what
styptic
for
a
bleeding
heart
can
equal
copious
squares
of
which
are
useful
for
slipping
down
the
moment
you
touch
them
how
our
fathers
managed
without
is
the
wonder
but
i
believe
some
small
and
feeble
substitute
existed
in
their
time
under
the
name
of
rebecca
linnet
however
had
neglected
tatting
as
well
as
other
forms
of
at
school
to
be
sure
she
had
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
in
acquiring
according
to
the
ingenious
method
then
fashionable
of
applying
the
shapes
of
leaves
and
flowers
cut
out
in
cardboard
and
scrubbing
a
brush
over
the
surface
thus
conveniently
marked
out
but
even
the
and
which
were
her
last
performances
in
that
way
were
not
considered
eminently
successful
and
had
long
been
consigned
to
the
retirement
of
the
best
bedroom
thus
there
was
a
good
deal
of
family
unlikeness
between
rebecca
and
her
sister
and
i
am
afraid
there
was
also
a
little
family
dislike
but
mary
disapproval
had
usually
been
kept
imprisoned
behind
her
thin
lips
for
rebecca
was
not
only
of
a
headstrong
disposition
but
was
her
mother
pet
the
old
lady
being
herself
stout
and
preferring
a
more
showy
style
of
cap
than
she
could
prevail
on
her
daughter
mary
to
make
up
for
her
but
i
have
been
describing
miss
rebecca
as
she
was
in
former
days
only
for
her
appearance
this
evening
as
she
sits
pasting
on
the
green
tickets
is
in
striking
contrast
with
what
it
was
three
or
four
months
ago
her
plain
grey
gingham
dress
and
plain
white
collar
could
never
have
belonged
to
her
before
that
date
and
though
she
is
not
reduced
in
size
and
her
brown
hair
will
do
nothing
but
hang
in
crisp
ringlets
down
her
large
cheeks
there
is
a
change
in
her
air
and
expression
which
seems
to
shed
a
softened
light
over
her
person
and
make
her
look
like
a
peony
in
the
shade
instead
of
the
same
flower
flaunting
in
a
parterre
in
the
hot
sunlight
no
one
could
deny
that
evangelicalism
had
wrought
a
change
for
the
better
in
rebecca
linnet
person
not
even
miss
pratt
the
thin
stiff
lady
in
spectacles
seated
opposite
to
her
who
always
had
a
peculiar
repulsion
for
with
a
gross
habit
of
body
miss
pratt
was
an
old
maid
but
that
is
a
no
more
definite
description
than
if
i
had
said
she
was
in
the
autumn
of
life
was
it
autumn
when
the
orchards
are
fragrant
with
apples
or
autumn
when
the
oaks
are
brown
or
autumn
when
the
last
yellow
leaves
are
fluttering
in
the
chill
breeze
the
young
ladies
in
milby
would
have
told
you
that
the
miss
linnets
were
old
maids
but
the
miss
linnets
were
to
miss
pratt
what
the
september
is
to
the
bare
nipping
days
of
late
november
the
miss
linnets
were
in
that
temperate
zone
of
when
a
woman
will
not
say
but
that
if
a
man
of
suitable
years
and
character
were
to
offer
himself
she
might
be
induced
to
tread
the
remainder
of
life
vale
in
company
with
him
miss
pratt
was
in
that
arctic
region
where
a
woman
is
confident
that
at
no
time
of
life
would
she
have
consented
to
give
up
her
liberty
and
that
she
has
never
seen
the
man
whom
she
would
engage
to
honour
and
obey
if
the
miss
linnets
were
old
maids
they
were
old
maids
with
natural
ringlets
and
embonpoint
not
to
say
obesity
miss
pratt
was
an
old
maid
with
a
cap
a
braided
a
backbone
and
appendages
miss
pratt
was
the
one
of
milby
possessing
she
said
no
less
than
five
hundred
volumes
competent
as
her
brother
the
doctor
often
observed
to
conduct
a
conversation
on
any
topic
whatever
and
occasionally
dabbling
a
little
in
authorship
though
it
was
understood
that
she
had
never
put
forth
the
full
powers
of
her
mind
in
print
her
to
a
young
man
on
his
entrance
into
life
and
courcy
or
the
rash
promise
a
tale
for
youth
were
mere
trifles
which
she
had
been
induced
to
publish
because
they
were
calculated
for
popular
utility
but
they
were
nothing
to
what
she
had
for
years
had
by
her
in
manuscript
her
latest
production
had
been
six
stanzas
addressed
to
the
rev
edgar
tryan
printed
on
glazed
paper
with
a
neat
border
and
beginning
young
wrestler
for
the
truth
miss
pratt
having
kept
her
brother
house
during
his
long
widowhood
his
daughter
miss
eliza
had
had
the
advantage
of
being
educated
by
her
aunt
and
thus
of
imbibing
a
very
strong
antipathy
to
all
that
remarkable
woman
tastes
and
opinions
the
silent
handsome
girl
of
who
is
covering
the
of
felix
neff
is
miss
eliza
pratt
and
the
small
elderly
lady
in
dowdy
clothing
who
is
also
working
diligently
is
pettifer
a
widow
much
valued
in
milby
being
such
a
very
respectable
person
to
have
in
the
house
in
case
of
illness
and
of
quite
too
good
a
family
to
receive
any
you
could
always
send
her
that
would
make
her
ample
amends
miss
pratt
has
enough
to
do
in
commenting
on
the
heap
of
volumes
before
her
feeling
it
a
responsibility
entailed
on
her
by
her
great
powers
of
mind
to
leave
nothing
without
the
advantage
of
her
opinion
whatever
was
good
must
be
sprinkled
with
the
chrism
of
her
approval
whatever
was
evil
must
be
blighted
by
her
condemnation
my
word
she
said
in
a
deliberate
high
voice
as
if
she
were
dictating
to
an
amanuensis
is
a
most
admirable
selection
of
works
for
popular
reading
this
that
our
excellent
tryan
has
made
i
do
not
know
whether
if
the
task
had
been
confided
to
me
i
could
have
made
a
selection
combining
in
a
higher
degree
religious
instruction
and
edification
with
a
due
admixture
of
the
purer
species
of
amusement
this
story
of
clement
is
a
library
in
itself
on
the
errors
of
romanism
i
have
ever
considered
fiction
a
suitable
form
for
conveying
moral
and
religious
instruction
as
i
have
shown
in
my
little
work
courcy
which
as
a
very
clever
writer
in
the
crompton
said
at
the
time
of
its
appearance
is
the
light
vehicle
of
a
weighty
moral
think
said
linnet
who
also
had
her
spectacles
on
but
chiefly
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
what
the
others
were
doing
did
want
much
to
drive
people
away
from
a
religion
as
makes
walk
barefoot
over
stone
floors
like
that
girl
in
father
clement
sending
the
blood
up
to
the
head
frightful
anybody
might
see
that
was
an
creed
said
miss
pratt
asceticism
is
not
the
root
of
the
error
as
tryan
was
telling
us
the
other
evening
it
is
the
denial
of
the
great
doctrine
of
justification
by
faith
much
as
i
had
reflected
on
all
subjects
in
the
course
of
my
life
i
am
indebted
to
tryan
for
opening
my
eyes
to
the
full
importance
of
that
cardinal
doctrine
of
the
reformation
from
a
child
i
had
a
deep
sense
of
religion
but
in
my
early
days
the
gospel
light
was
obscured
in
the
english
church
notwithstanding
the
possession
of
our
incomparable
liturgy
than
which
i
know
no
human
composition
more
faultless
and
sublime
as
i
tell
eliza
i
was
not
blest
as
she
is
at
the
age
of
in
knowing
a
clergyman
who
unites
all
that
is
great
and
admirable
in
intellect
with
the
highest
spiritual
gifts
i
am
no
contemptible
judge
of
a
man
acquirements
and
i
assure
you
i
have
tested
tryan
by
questions
which
are
a
pretty
severe
touchstone
it
is
true
i
sometimes
carry
him
a
little
beyond
the
depth
of
the
other
listeners
profound
learning
continued
miss
pratt
shutting
her
spectacles
and
tapping
them
on
the
book
before
her
not
many
to
estimate
it
in
milby
pratt
said
rebecca
you
please
give
me
scott
force
of
truth
there
that
small
book
lying
against
the
life
of
legh
richmond
a
book
i
very
fond
of
the
life
of
legh
richmond
said
linnet
found
out
all
about
that
woman
at
tutbury
as
pretended
to
live
without
eating
stuff
and
nonsense
linnet
had
become
a
reader
of
religious
books
since
advent
and
as
she
was
in
the
habit
of
confining
her
perusal
to
the
purely
secular
portions
which
bore
a
very
small
proportion
to
the
whole
she
could
make
rapid
progress
through
a
large
number
of
volumes
on
taking
up
the
biography
of
a
celebrated
preacher
she
immediately
turned
to
the
end
to
see
what
disease
he
died
of
and
if
his
legs
swelled
as
her
own
occasionally
did
she
felt
a
stronger
interest
in
ascertaining
any
earlier
facts
in
the
history
of
the
dropsical
divine
whether
he
had
ever
fallen
off
a
stage
coach
whether
he
had
married
more
than
one
wife
and
in
general
any
adventures
or
repartees
recorded
of
him
previous
to
the
epoch
of
his
conversion
she
then
glanced
over
the
letters
and
diary
and
wherever
there
was
a
predominance
of
zion
the
river
of
life
and
notes
of
exclamation
she
turned
over
to
the
next
page
but
any
passage
in
which
she
saw
such
promising
nouns
as
or
and
shoes
at
once
arrested
her
is
six
now
said
miss
linnet
looking
at
her
watch
as
the
servant
appeared
with
the
suppose
the
delegates
are
come
back
by
this
time
if
tryan
had
not
so
kindly
promised
to
call
and
let
us
know
i
should
hardly
rest
without
walking
to
milby
myself
to
know
what
answer
they
have
brought
back
it
is
a
great
privilege
for
us
tryan
living
at
wagstaff
for
he
is
often
able
to
take
us
on
his
way
backwards
and
forwards
into
the
town
wonder
if
there
another
man
in
the
world
who
has
been
brought
up
as
tryan
has
that
would
choose
to
live
in
those
small
close
rooms
on
the
common
among
heaps
of
dirty
cottages
for
the
sake
of
being
near
the
poor
people
said
pettifer
afraid
he
hurts
his
health
by
it
he
looks
to
me
far
from
strong
said
miss
pratt
understand
he
is
of
a
highly
respectable
family
indeed
in
huntingdonshire
i
heard
him
myself
speak
of
his
carriage
quite
incidentally
you
know
and
eliza
tells
me
what
very
fine
cambric
handkerchiefs
he
uses
my
eyes
are
not
good
enough
to
see
such
things
but
i
know
what
breeding
is
as
well
as
most
people
and
it
is
easy
to
see
that
tryan
is
quite
il
to
use
a
french
expression
should
like
to
tell
him
better
nor
use
fine
cambric
i
this
place
where
there
such
washing
it
a
shame
to
be
seen
said
linnet
get
tore
to
pieces
good
lawn
be
far
better
i
saw
what
a
colour
his
linen
looked
at
the
sacrament
last
sunday
mary
making
him
a
black
silk
case
to
hold
his
bands
but
i
told
her
she
more
need
wash
for
him
mother
said
rebecca
with
solemn
severity
do
think
of
and
linen
when
we
are
talking
of
such
a
man
and
at
this
moment
too
when
he
is
perhaps
having
to
bear
a
heavy
blow
we
have
more
need
to
help
him
by
prayer
as
aaron
and
hur
held
up
the
hands
of
moses
we
do
know
but
wickedness
may
have
triumphed
and
prendergast
may
have
consented
to
forbid
the
lecture
there
have
been
dispensations
quite
as
mysterious
and
satan
is
evidently
putting
forth
all
his
strength
to
resist
the
entrance
of
the
gospel
into
milby
church
niver
spoke
a
truer
word
than
that
my
dear
said
linnet
who
accepted
all
religious
phrases
but
was
extremely
rationalistic
in
her
interpretation
if
iver
old
harry
appeared
in
a
human
form
that
dempster
it
was
all
through
him
as
we
got
cheated
out
o
croft
making
out
as
the
title
was
good
such
lawyer
villany
as
if
paying
good
money
was
title
enough
to
anything
if
your
father
as
is
dead
and
gone
had
been
worthy
to
know
it
but
he
have
a
fall
some
day
dempster
will
mark
my
words
out
of
his
carriage
you
mean
said
miss
pratt
who
in
the
movement
occasioned
by
the
clearing
of
the
table
had
lost
the
first
part
of
linnet
speech
certainly
is
alarming
to
see
him
driving
home
from
rotherby
flogging
his
galloping
horse
like
a
madman
my
brother
has
often
said
he
expected
every
thursday
evening
to
be
called
in
to
set
some
of
dempster
bones
but
i
suppose
he
may
drop
that
expectation
now
for
we
are
given
to
understand
from
good
authority
that
he
has
forbidden
his
wife
to
call
my
brother
in
again
either
to
herself
or
her
mother
he
swears
no
tryanite
doctor
shall
attend
his
family
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
pilgrim
was
called
in
to
mother
the
other
day
raynor
she
glad
to
do
anything
for
the
sake
of
peace
and
quietness
said
pettifer
it
no
trifle
at
her
time
of
life
to
part
with
a
doctor
who
knows
her
constitution
trouble
that
poor
woman
has
to
bear
in
her
old
age
said
mary
linnet
see
her
daughter
leading
such
a
life
an
only
daughter
too
that
she
doats
on
indeed
said
miss
pratt
of
course
know
more
about
it
than
most
people
my
brother
having
attended
the
family
so
many
years
for
my
part
i
never
thought
well
of
the
marriage
and
i
endeavoured
to
dissuade
my
brother
when
raynor
asked
him
to
give
janet
away
at
the
wedding
you
will
take
my
advice
richard
i
said
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
marriage
and
he
has
seen
the
justice
of
my
opinion
since
raynor
herself
was
against
the
connection
at
first
but
she
always
spoiled
janet
and
i
fear
too
she
was
won
over
by
a
foolish
pride
in
having
her
daughter
marry
a
professional
man
i
fear
it
was
so
no
one
but
myself
i
think
foresaw
the
extent
of
the
evil
said
pettifer
had
nothing
to
look
forward
to
but
being
a
governess
and
it
was
hard
for
raynor
to
have
to
work
at
millinering
a
woman
well
brought
up
and
her
husband
a
man
who
held
his
head
as
high
as
any
man
in
thurston
and
it
is
everybody
that
sees
everything
fifteen
years
beforehand
robert
dempster
was
the
cleverest
man
in
milby
and
there
were
many
young
men
fit
to
talk
to
janet
is
a
thousand
pities
said
miss
pratt
choosing
to
ignore
pettifer
slight
sarcasm
i
certainly
did
consider
janet
raynor
the
most
promising
young
woman
of
my
acquaintance
a
little
too
much
lifted
up
perhaps
by
her
superior
education
and
too
much
given
to
satire
but
able
to
express
herself
very
well
indeed
about
any
book
i
recommended
to
her
perusal
there
is
no
young
woman
in
milby
now
who
can
be
compared
with
what
janet
was
when
she
was
married
either
in
mind
or
person
i
consider
miss
landor
far
far
below
her
indeed
i
can
not
say
much
for
the
mental
superiority
of
the
young
ladies
in
our
first
families
they
are
superficial
very
superficial
made
the
handsomest
bride
that
ever
came
out
of
milby
church
too
said
pettifer
a
very
fine
figure
and
it
showed
off
her
white
poplin
so
well
and
what
a
pretty
smile
janet
always
had
poor
thing
she
keeps
that
now
for
all
her
old
friends
i
never
see
her
but
she
has
something
pretty
to
say
to
me
living
in
the
same
street
you
know
i
ca
help
seeing
her
often
though
i
never
been
to
the
house
since
dempster
broke
out
on
me
in
one
of
his
drunken
fits
she
comes
to
me
sometimes
poor
thing
looking
so
strange
anybody
passing
her
in
the
street
may
see
plain
enough
what
the
matter
but
she
always
got
some
little
plan
in
her
head
for
all
that
only
last
night
i
met
her
i
saw
five
yards
off
she
was
fit
to
be
out
but
she
had
a
basin
in
her
hand
full
of
something
she
was
carrying
to
sally
martin
the
deformed
girl
that
in
a
consumption
she
is
just
as
bitter
against
tryan
as
her
husband
is
i
understand
said
rebecca
heart
is
very
much
set
against
the
truth
for
i
understand
she
bought
tryan
sermons
on
purpose
to
ridicule
them
to
crewe
poor
thing
said
pettifer
know
she
stands
up
for
everything
her
husband
says
and
does
she
never
will
admit
to
anybody
that
he
is
not
a
good
husband
is
her
pride
said
miss
pratt
married
him
in
opposition
to
the
advice
of
her
best
friends
and
now
she
is
not
willing
to
admit
that
she
was
wrong
why
even
to
my
brother
and
a
medical
attendant
you
know
can
hardly
fail
to
be
acquainted
with
family
secrets
she
has
always
pretended
to
have
the
highest
respect
for
her
husband
qualities
poor
raynor
however
is
very
well
aware
that
every
one
knows
the
real
state
of
things
latterly
she
has
not
even
avoided
the
subject
with
me
the
very
last
time
i
called
on
her
she
said
have
you
been
to
see
my
poor
daughter
and
burst
into
tears
or
no
pride
said
pettifer
shall
always
stand
up
for
janet
dempster
she
sat
up
with
me
night
after
night
when
i
had
that
attack
of
rheumatic
fever
six
years
ago
there
great
excuses
for
her
when
a
woman
ca
think
of
her
husband
coming
home
without
trembling
it
enough
to
make
her
drink
something
to
blunt
her
feelings
and
no
children
either
to
keep
her
from
it
you
and
me
might
do
the
same
if
we
were
in
her
place
for
yourself
pettifer
said
miss
pratt
no
circumstances
can
i
imagine
myself
resorting
to
a
practice
so
degrading
a
woman
should
find
support
in
her
own
strength
of
mind
think
said
rebecca
who
considered
miss
pratt
still
very
blind
in
spiritual
things
notwithstanding
her
assumption
of
enlightenment
will
find
poor
support
if
she
trusts
only
to
her
own
strength
she
must
seek
aid
elsewhere
than
in
herself
happily
the
removal
of
the
just
then
created
a
little
confusion
which
aided
miss
pratt
to
repress
her
resentment
at
presumption
in
correcting
her
a
person
like
rebecca
linnet
who
six
months
ago
was
as
flighty
and
vain
a
woman
as
miss
pratt
had
ever
known
so
very
unconscious
of
her
unfortunate
person
the
ladies
had
scarcely
been
seated
at
their
work
another
hour
when
the
sun
was
sinking
and
the
clouds
that
flecked
the
sky
to
the
very
zenith
were
every
moment
taking
on
a
brighter
gold
the
gate
of
the
little
garden
opened
and
miss
linnet
seated
at
her
small
table
near
the
window
saw
tryan
enter
is
tryan
she
said
and
her
pale
cheek
was
lighted
up
with
a
little
blush
that
would
have
made
her
look
more
attractive
to
almost
any
one
except
miss
eliza
pratt
whose
fine
grey
eyes
allowed
few
things
to
escape
her
silent
observation
linnet
gets
more
and
more
in
love
with
tryan
thought
miss
eliza
is
really
pitiable
to
see
such
feelings
in
a
woman
of
her
age
with
those
little
ringlets
i
daresay
she
flatters
herself
tryan
may
fall
in
love
with
her
because
he
makes
her
useful
among
the
poor
at
the
same
time
miss
eliza
as
she
bent
her
handsome
head
and
large
cannon
curls
with
apparent
calmness
over
her
work
felt
a
considerable
internal
flutter
when
she
heard
the
knock
at
the
door
rebecca
had
less
she
felt
too
much
agitated
to
go
on
with
her
pasting
and
clutched
the
leg
of
the
table
to
counteract
the
trembling
in
her
hands
poor
women
hearts
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
laugh
at
you
and
make
cheap
jests
on
your
susceptibility
towards
the
clerical
sex
as
if
it
had
nothing
deeper
or
more
lovely
in
it
than
the
mere
vulgar
angling
for
a
husband
even
in
these
enlightened
days
many
a
curate
who
considered
abstractedly
is
nothing
more
than
a
sleek
bimanous
animal
in
a
white
with
views
more
or
less
anglican
and
furtively
addicted
to
the
flute
is
adored
by
a
girl
who
has
coarse
brothers
or
by
a
solitary
woman
who
would
like
to
be
a
helpmate
in
good
works
beyond
her
own
means
simply
because
he
seems
to
them
the
model
of
refinement
and
of
public
usefulness
what
wonder
then
that
in
milby
society
such
as
i
have
told
you
it
was
a
very
long
while
ago
a
zealous
evangelical
clergyman
aged
called
forth
all
the
little
agitations
that
belong
to
the
divine
necessity
of
loving
implanted
in
the
miss
linnets
with
their
seven
or
eight
lustrums
and
their
unfashionable
ringlets
no
less
than
in
miss
eliza
pratt
with
her
youthful
bloom
and
her
ample
cannon
curls
but
tryan
has
entered
the
room
and
the
strange
light
from
the
golden
sky
falling
on
his
hair
which
is
brushed
high
up
round
his
head
makes
it
look
almost
like
an
aureole
his
grey
eyes
too
shine
with
unwonted
brilliancy
this
evening
they
were
not
remarkable
eyes
but
they
accorded
completely
in
their
changing
light
with
the
changing
expression
of
his
person
which
indicated
the
paradoxical
character
often
observable
in
a
sanguine
blond
at
once
mild
and
irritable
gentle
and
overbearing
indolent
and
resolute
and
dreamy
except
that
the
lips
had
something
of
the
artificially
compressed
look
which
is
often
the
sign
of
a
struggle
to
keep
the
dragon
undermost
and
that
the
complexion
was
rather
pallid
giving
the
idea
of
imperfect
health
tryan
face
in
repose
was
that
of
an
ordinary
whiskerless
blond
and
it
seemed
difficult
to
refer
a
certain
air
of
distinction
about
him
to
anything
in
particular
unless
it
were
his
delicate
hands
and
feet
it
was
a
great
anomaly
to
the
milby
mind
that
a
canting
evangelical
parson
who
would
take
tea
with
tradespeople
and
make
friends
of
vulgar
women
like
the
linnets
should
have
so
much
the
air
of
a
gentleman
and
be
so
little
like
the
stickney
of
salem
to
whom
he
approximated
so
closely
in
doctrine
and
this
want
of
correspondence
between
the
physique
and
the
creed
had
excited
no
less
surprise
in
the
larger
town
of
laxeter
where
tryan
had
formerly
held
a
curacy
for
of
the
two
other
low
church
clergymen
in
the
neighbourhood
one
was
a
welshman
of
globose
figure
and
unctuous
complexion
and
the
other
a
man
of
atrabiliar
aspect
with
lank
black
hair
and
a
redundance
of
limp
cravat
in
fact
the
sort
of
thing
you
might
expect
in
men
who
distributed
the
publications
of
the
religious
tract
society
and
introduced
dissenting
hymns
into
the
church
tryan
shook
hands
with
linnet
bowed
with
rather
a
preoccupied
air
to
the
other
ladies
and
seated
himself
in
the
large
which
had
been
drawn
forward
for
him
while
the
ladies
ceased
from
their
work
and
fixed
their
eyes
on
him
awaiting
the
news
he
had
to
tell
them
seems
he
began
in
a
low
and
silvery
tone
need
a
lesson
of
patience
there
has
been
something
wrong
in
my
thought
or
action
about
this
evening
lecture
i
have
been
too
much
bent
on
doing
good
to
milby
after
my
own
plan
too
reliant
on
my
own
wisdom
tryan
paused
he
was
struggling
against
inward
irritation
delegates
are
come
back
then
prendergast
given
way
dempster
succeeded
were
the
eager
questions
of
three
ladies
at
once
the
town
is
in
an
uproar
as
we
were
sitting
in
we
heard
a
loud
cheering
and
presently
thrupp
the
clerk
at
the
bank
who
had
been
waiting
at
the
red
lion
to
hear
the
result
came
to
let
us
know
he
said
dempster
had
been
making
a
speech
to
the
mob
out
the
window
they
were
distributing
drink
to
the
people
and
hoisting
placards
in
great
letters
down
with
the
tryanites
down
with
cant
they
had
a
hideous
caricature
of
me
being
and
pitched
out
of
the
pulpit
good
old
landor
would
insist
on
sending
me
round
in
the
carriage
he
thought
i
should
not
be
safe
from
the
mob
but
i
got
down
at
the
crossways
the
row
was
evidently
preconcerted
by
dempster
before
he
set
out
he
made
sure
of
succeeding
tryan
utterance
had
been
getting
rather
louder
and
more
rapid
in
the
course
of
this
speech
and
he
now
added
in
the
energetic
which
both
in
and
out
of
the
pulpit
alternated
continually
with
his
more
silvery
notes
his
triumph
will
be
a
short
one
if
he
thinks
he
can
intimidate
me
by
obloquy
or
threats
he
has
mistaken
the
man
he
has
to
deal
with
dempster
and
his
colleagues
will
find
themselves
checkmated
after
all
prendergast
has
been
false
to
his
own
conscience
in
this
business
he
knows
as
well
as
i
do
that
he
is
throwing
away
the
souls
of
the
people
by
leaving
things
as
they
are
in
the
parish
but
i
shall
appeal
to
the
bishop
i
am
confident
of
his
sympathy
bishop
will
be
coming
shortly
i
suppose
said
miss
pratt
hold
a
confirmation
but
i
shall
write
to
him
at
once
and
lay
the
case
before
him
indeed
i
must
hurry
away
now
for
i
have
many
matters
to
attend
to
you
ladies
have
been
kindly
helping
me
with
your
labours
i
see
continued
tryan
politely
glancing
at
the
books
as
he
rose
from
his
seat
then
turning
to
mary
linnet
library
is
really
getting
on
i
think
you
and
your
sister
have
quite
a
heavy
task
of
distribution
now
poor
rebecca
felt
it
very
hard
to
bear
that
tryan
did
not
turn
towards
her
too
if
he
knew
how
much
she
entered
into
his
feelings
about
the
lecture
and
the
interest
she
took
in
the
library
well
perhaps
it
was
her
lot
to
be
overlooked
and
it
might
be
a
token
of
mercy
even
a
good
man
might
not
always
know
the
heart
that
was
most
with
him
but
the
next
moment
poor
mary
had
a
pang
when
tryan
turned
to
miss
eliza
pratt
and
the
preoccupied
expression
of
his
face
melted
into
that
beaming
timidity
with
which
a
man
almost
always
addresses
a
pretty
woman
have
to
thank
you
too
miss
eliza
for
seconding
me
so
well
in
your
visits
to
joseph
mercer
the
old
man
tells
me
how
precious
he
finds
your
reading
to
him
now
he
is
no
longer
able
to
go
to
church
miss
eliza
only
answered
by
a
blush
which
made
her
look
all
the
handsomer
but
her
aunt
said
tryan
i
have
ever
inculcated
on
my
dear
eliza
the
importance
of
spending
her
leisure
in
being
useful
to
her
your
example
and
instruction
have
been
quite
in
the
spirit
of
the
system
which
i
have
always
pursued
though
we
are
indebted
to
you
for
a
clearer
view
of
the
motives
that
should
actuate
us
in
our
pursuit
of
good
works
not
that
i
can
accuse
myself
of
having
ever
had
a
spirit
but
my
humility
was
rather
instinctive
than
based
on
a
firm
ground
of
doctrinal
knowledge
such
as
you
so
admirably
impart
to
us
linnet
usual
entreaty
that
tryan
would
something
some
wine
and
water
and
a
biscuit
was
just
here
a
welcome
relief
from
the
necessity
of
answering
miss
pratt
oration
anything
my
dear
linnet
thank
you
you
forget
what
a
rechabite
i
am
by
the
by
when
i
went
this
morning
to
see
a
poor
girl
in
butcher
lane
whom
i
had
heard
of
as
being
in
a
consumption
i
found
dempster
there
i
had
often
met
her
in
the
street
but
did
not
know
it
was
dempster
it
seems
she
goes
among
the
poor
a
good
deal
she
is
really
an
woman
i
was
quite
surprised
for
i
have
heard
the
worst
account
of
her
habits
that
she
is
almost
as
bad
as
her
husband
she
went
out
hastily
as
soon
as
i
entered
but
apologetically
am
keeping
you
all
standing
and
i
must
really
hurry
away
pettifer
i
have
not
had
the
pleasure
of
calling
on
you
for
some
time
i
shall
take
an
early
opportunity
of
going
your
way
good
evening
good
evening
chapter
tryan
was
right
in
saying
that
the
in
milby
had
been
preconcerted
by
dempster
the
placards
and
the
caricature
were
prepared
before
the
departure
of
the
delegates
and
it
had
been
settled
that
mat
paine
dempster
clerk
should
ride
out
on
thursday
morning
to
meet
them
at
whitlow
the
last
place
where
they
would
change
horses
that
he
might
gallop
back
and
prepare
an
ovation
for
the
triumvirate
in
case
of
their
success
dempster
had
determined
to
dine
at
whitlow
so
that
mat
paine
was
in
milby
again
two
hours
before
the
entrance
of
the
delegates
and
had
time
to
send
a
whisper
up
the
back
streets
that
there
was
promise
of
a
in
the
bridge
way
as
well
as
to
assemble
two
knots
of
picked
men
one
to
feed
the
flame
of
orthodox
zeal
with
at
the
green
man
near
high
street
the
other
to
solidify
their
church
principles
with
heady
beer
at
the
bear
and
ragged
staff
in
the
bridge
way
the
bridge
way
was
an
irregular
straggling
street
where
the
town
fringed
off
raggedly
into
the
whitlow
road
rows
of
new
houses
in
which
were
rattling
behind
long
lines
of
window
alternating
with
old
cottages
one
of
those
dismal
wide
streets
where
dirt
and
misery
have
no
long
shadows
thrown
on
them
to
soften
their
ugliness
here
about
five
silly
caleb
an
idiot
well
known
in
dog
lane
but
more
of
a
stranger
in
the
bridge
way
was
seen
slouching
along
with
a
string
of
boys
hooting
at
his
heels
presently
another
group
for
the
most
part
out
at
elbows
came
briskly
in
the
same
direction
looking
round
them
with
an
air
of
expectation
and
at
no
long
interval
deb
traunter
in
a
pink
flounced
gown
and
floating
ribbons
was
observed
talking
with
great
affability
to
two
men
in
caps
and
fustian
who
formed
her
cortege
the
bridge
way
began
to
have
a
presentiment
of
something
in
the
wind
phib
cook
left
her
evening
and
appeared
at
her
door
in
a
and
general
dampness
three
in
rusty
black
streaked
with
shreds
of
silk
sauntered
out
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
and
molly
beale
a
brawny
old
virago
descrying
wiry
dame
ricketts
peeping
out
from
her
entry
seized
the
opportunity
of
renewing
the
morning
skirmish
in
short
the
bridge
way
was
in
that
state
of
excitement
which
is
understood
to
announce
a
on
the
part
of
the
british
public
and
the
afflux
of
remote
townsmen
increasing
there
was
soon
so
large
a
crowd
that
it
was
time
for
bill
powers
a
plethoric
goliath
who
presided
over
the
knot
of
at
the
bear
and
ragged
staff
to
issue
forth
with
his
companions
and
like
the
enunciator
of
the
ancient
myth
make
the
assemblage
distinctly
conscious
of
the
common
sentiment
that
had
drawn
them
together
the
expectation
of
the
delegates
chaise
added
to
the
fight
between
molly
beale
and
dame
ricketts
and
the
appearance
of
a
lean
were
a
sufficient
to
the
popular
excitement
during
the
remaining
quarter
of
an
hour
at
the
end
of
which
the
chaise
was
seen
approaching
along
the
whitlow
road
with
oak
boughs
ornamenting
the
horses
heads
and
to
quote
the
account
of
this
interesting
scene
which
was
sent
to
the
cheers
immediately
testified
to
the
sympathy
of
the
honest
fellows
collected
there
with
the
exertions
of
their
bill
powers
whose
bloodshot
eyes
bent
hat
and
protuberant
altitude
marked
him
out
as
the
natural
leader
of
the
assemblage
undertook
to
interpret
the
common
sentiment
by
stopping
the
chaise
advancing
to
the
door
with
raised
hat
and
begging
to
know
of
dempster
whether
the
rector
had
forbidden
the
lecture
yes
said
dempster
up
a
jolly
good
hurray
no
public
duty
could
have
been
more
easy
and
agreeable
to
mr
powers
and
his
associates
and
the
chorus
swelled
all
the
way
to
the
high
street
where
by
a
mysterious
coincidence
often
observable
in
these
spontaneous
large
placards
on
long
poles
were
observed
to
shoot
upwards
from
among
the
crowd
principally
in
the
direction
of
lane
where
the
green
man
was
situated
one
bore
with
the
tryanites
another
cant
another
live
our
venerable
curate
and
one
in
still
larger
letters
church
principles
and
no
hypocrisy
but
a
still
more
remarkable
impromptu
was
a
huge
caricature
of
tryan
in
gown
and
band
with
an
enormous
aureole
of
yellow
hair
and
upturned
eyes
standing
on
the
pulpit
stairs
and
trying
to
pull
down
old
crewe
groans
yells
and
hisses
hisses
yells
and
groans
only
stemmed
by
the
appearance
of
another
caricature
representing
tryan
being
pitched
from
the
pulpit
stairs
by
a
hand
which
the
artist
either
from
subtilty
of
intention
or
want
of
space
had
left
unindicated
in
the
midst
of
the
tremendous
cheering
that
saluted
this
piece
of
symbolical
art
the
chaise
had
reached
the
door
of
the
red
lion
and
loud
cries
of
for
ever
with
a
feebler
cheer
now
and
then
for
tomlinson
and
budd
were
presently
responded
to
by
the
appearance
of
the
attorney
at
the
large
upper
window
where
also
were
visible
a
little
in
the
background
the
small
sleek
head
of
budd
and
the
blinking
countenance
of
tomlinson
dempster
held
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
poked
his
head
forward
with
a
butting
motion
by
way
of
bow
a
storm
of
cheers
subsided
at
last
into
dropping
sounds
of
him
it
dempster
and
the
lawyer
rasping
voice
became
distinctly
audible
it
gives
us
the
sincerest
pleasure
i
speak
for
my
respected
colleagues
as
well
as
myself
to
witness
these
strong
proofs
of
your
attachment
to
the
principles
of
our
excellent
church
and
your
zeal
for
the
honour
of
our
venerable
pastor
but
it
is
no
more
than
i
expected
of
you
i
know
you
well
i
known
you
for
the
last
twenty
years
to
be
as
honest
and
respectable
a
set
of
ratepayers
as
any
in
this
county
your
hearts
are
sound
to
the
core
no
man
had
better
try
to
thrust
his
cant
and
hypocrisy
down
throats
you
used
to
wash
them
with
liquor
of
a
better
flavour
this
is
the
proudest
moment
in
my
own
life
and
i
think
i
may
say
in
that
of
my
colleagues
in
which
i
have
to
tell
you
that
our
exertions
in
the
cause
of
sound
religion
and
manly
morality
have
been
crowned
with
success
yes
my
i
have
the
gratification
of
announcing
to
you
thus
formally
what
you
have
already
learned
indirectly
the
pulpit
from
which
our
venerable
pastor
has
fed
us
with
sound
doctrine
for
half
a
century
is
not
to
be
invaded
by
a
fanatical
sectarian
jesuitical
interloper
we
are
not
to
have
our
young
people
demoralized
and
corrupted
by
the
temptations
to
vice
notoriously
connected
with
sunday
evening
lectures
we
are
not
to
have
a
preacher
obtruding
himself
upon
us
who
decries
good
works
and
sneaks
into
our
homes
perverting
the
faith
of
our
wives
and
daughters
we
are
not
to
be
poisoned
with
doctrines
which
damp
every
innocent
enjoyment
and
pick
a
poor
man
pocket
of
the
sixpence
with
which
he
might
buy
himself
a
cheerful
glass
after
a
hard
day
work
under
pretence
of
paying
for
bibles
to
send
to
the
chicktaws
i
not
going
to
waste
your
valuable
time
with
unnecessary
words
i
am
a
man
of
deeds
damn
you
that
you
are
and
you
charge
well
for
too
said
a
voice
from
the
crowd
probably
that
of
a
gentleman
who
was
immediately
afterwards
observed
with
his
hat
crushed
over
his
head
shall
always
be
at
the
service
of
my
and
whoever
dares
to
hector
over
you
or
interfere
with
your
innocent
pleasures
shall
have
an
account
to
settle
with
robert
dempster
my
boys
you
ca
do
better
than
disperse
and
carry
the
good
news
to
all
your
whose
hearts
are
as
sound
as
your
own
let
some
of
you
go
one
way
and
some
another
that
every
man
woman
and
child
in
milby
may
know
what
you
know
yourselves
but
before
we
part
let
us
have
three
cheers
for
true
religion
and
down
with
cant
when
the
last
cheer
was
dying
dempster
closed
the
window
and
the
placards
and
caricatures
moved
off
in
divers
directions
followed
by
larger
or
smaller
divisions
of
the
crowd
the
greatest
attraction
apparently
lay
in
the
direction
of
dog
lane
the
outlet
towards
paddiford
common
whither
the
caricatures
were
moving
and
you
foresee
of
course
that
those
works
of
symbolical
art
were
consumed
with
a
liberal
expenditure
of
dry
and
vague
shouting
after
these
great
public
exertions
it
was
natural
that
dempster
and
his
colleagues
should
feel
more
in
need
than
usual
of
a
little
social
relaxation
and
a
party
of
their
friends
was
already
beginning
to
assemble
in
the
large
parlour
of
the
red
lion
convened
partly
by
their
own
curiosity
and
partly
by
the
invaluable
mat
paine
the
most
capacious
was
put
in
requisition
and
that
born
gentleman
lowme
seated
opposite
dempster
as
undertook
to
brew
the
punch
defying
the
criticisms
of
the
envious
men
out
of
office
who
with
the
readiness
of
irresponsibility
ignorantly
suggested
more
lemons
the
social
festivities
were
continued
till
long
past
midnight
when
several
friends
of
sound
religion
were
conveyed
home
with
some
difficulty
one
of
them
showing
a
dogged
determination
to
seat
himself
in
the
gutter
dempster
had
done
as
much
justice
to
the
punch
as
any
of
the
party
and
his
friend
boots
though
aware
that
the
lawyer
could
his
liquor
like
old
nick
with
whose
social
demeanour
boots
seemed
to
be
particularly
well
acquainted
nevertheless
thought
it
might
be
as
well
to
see
so
good
a
customer
in
safety
to
his
own
door
and
walked
quietly
behind
his
elbow
out
of
the
dempster
however
soon
became
aware
of
him
stopped
short
and
turning
slowly
round
upon
him
recognized
the
drab
waistcoat
sleeves
conspicuous
enough
in
the
starlight
twopenny
scoundrel
what
do
you
mean
by
dogging
a
professional
footsteps
in
this
way
i
break
every
bone
in
your
skin
if
you
attempt
to
track
me
like
a
beastly
cur
sniffing
at
one
pocket
do
you
think
a
gentleman
will
make
his
way
home
any
the
better
for
having
the
scent
of
your
thrust
up
his
nostrils
boots
slunk
back
in
more
amusement
than
thinking
the
lawyer
talk
was
doubtless
part
and
parcel
of
his
professional
ability
and
dempster
pursued
his
slow
way
alone
his
house
lay
in
orchard
street
which
opened
on
the
prettiest
outskirt
of
the
town
the
church
the
parsonage
and
a
long
stretch
of
green
fields
it
was
an
house
with
an
overhanging
upper
storey
outside
it
had
a
face
of
rough
stucco
and
casement
windows
with
green
frames
and
shutters
inside
it
was
full
of
long
passages
and
rooms
with
low
ceilings
there
was
a
large
heavy
knocker
on
the
green
door
and
though
dempster
carried
a
he
sometimes
chose
to
use
the
knocker
he
chose
to
do
so
now
the
thunder
resounded
through
orchard
street
and
after
a
single
minute
there
was
a
second
clap
louder
than
the
first
another
minute
and
still
the
door
was
not
opened
whereupon
dempster
muttering
took
out
his
and
with
less
difficulty
than
might
have
been
expected
thrust
it
into
the
door
when
he
opened
the
door
the
passage
was
dark
in
the
loudest
rasping
tone
was
the
next
sound
that
rang
through
the
house
again
before
a
slow
step
was
heard
on
the
stairs
and
a
distant
light
began
to
flicker
on
the
wall
of
the
passage
you
you
creeping
idiot
come
faster
ca
you
yet
a
few
seconds
and
the
figure
of
a
tall
woman
holding
aslant
a
candlestick
appeared
at
the
turning
of
the
passage
that
led
to
the
broader
entrance
she
had
on
a
light
dress
which
sat
loosely
about
her
figure
but
did
not
disguise
its
liberal
graceful
outline
a
heavy
mass
of
straight
hair
had
escaped
from
its
fastening
and
hung
over
her
shoulders
her
features
pale
with
the
natural
paleness
of
a
brunette
had
premature
lines
about
them
telling
that
the
years
had
been
lengthened
by
sorrow
and
the
nostril
which
seemed
made
to
quiver
with
the
proud
consciousness
of
power
and
beauty
must
have
quivered
to
the
griefs
which
had
given
that
worn
look
to
the
corners
of
the
mouth
her
wide
open
black
eyes
had
a
strangely
fixed
sightless
gaze
as
she
paused
at
the
turning
and
stood
silent
before
her
husband
teach
you
to
keep
me
waiting
in
the
dark
you
pale
staring
fool
he
said
advancing
with
his
slow
drunken
step
you
been
drinking
again
have
you
i
beat
you
into
your
senses
he
laid
his
hand
with
a
firm
grip
on
her
shoulder
turned
her
round
and
pushed
her
slowly
before
him
along
the
passage
and
through
the
door
which
stood
open
on
their
left
hand
there
was
a
portrait
of
janet
mother
a
old
woman
in
a
neatly
fluted
cap
hanging
over
the
mantelpiece
surely
the
aged
eyes
take
on
a
look
of
anguish
as
they
see
janet
not
trembling
no
it
would
be
better
if
she
trembled
standing
stupidly
unmoved
in
her
great
beauty
while
the
heavy
arm
is
lifted
to
strike
her
the
blow
falls
another
and
another
surely
the
mother
hears
that
cry
robert
pity
pity
poor
woman
was
it
for
this
you
suffered
a
mother
pangs
in
your
lone
widowhood
years
ago
was
it
for
this
you
kept
the
little
worn
morocco
shoes
janet
had
first
run
in
and
kissed
them
day
by
day
when
she
was
away
from
you
a
tall
girl
at
school
was
it
for
this
you
looked
proudly
at
her
when
she
came
back
to
you
in
her
rich
pale
beauty
like
a
tall
white
arum
that
has
just
unfolded
its
grand
pure
curves
to
the
sun
the
mother
lies
sleepless
and
praying
in
her
lonely
house
weeping
the
difficult
tears
of
age
because
she
dreads
this
may
be
a
cruel
night
for
her
child
she
too
has
a
picture
over
her
mantelpiece
drawn
in
chalk
by
janet
long
years
ago
she
looked
at
it
before
she
went
to
bed
it
is
a
head
bowed
beneath
a
cross
and
wearing
a
crown
of
thorns
chapter
it
was
nine
in
the
morning
the
midsummer
sun
was
already
warm
on
the
roofs
and
weathercocks
of
milby
the
were
ringing
and
many
families
were
conscious
of
sunday
sensations
chiefly
referable
to
the
fact
that
the
daughters
had
come
down
to
breakfast
in
their
best
frocks
and
with
their
hair
particularly
well
dressed
for
it
was
not
sunday
but
wednesday
and
though
the
bishop
was
going
to
hold
a
confirmation
and
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
sunday
evening
lecture
in
milby
the
sunbeams
had
the
usual
look
to
the
haymakers
already
long
out
in
the
fields
and
to
laggard
weavers
just
up
their
week
the
notion
of
its
being
sunday
was
the
strongest
in
young
ladies
like
miss
phipps
who
was
going
to
accompany
her
younger
sister
to
the
confirmation
and
to
wear
a
pretty
transparent
bonnet
with
marabout
feathers
on
the
interesting
occasion
thus
throwing
into
relief
the
suitable
simplicity
of
her
sister
attire
who
was
of
course
to
appear
in
a
new
white
frock
or
in
the
pupils
at
miss
townley
who
were
absolved
from
all
lessons
and
were
going
to
church
to
see
the
bishop
and
to
hear
the
honourable
and
reverend
prendergast
the
rector
read
prayers
a
high
intellectual
treat
as
miss
townley
assured
them
it
seemed
only
natural
that
a
rector
who
was
honourable
should
read
better
than
old
crewe
who
was
only
a
curate
and
not
honourable
and
when
little
clara
robins
wondered
why
some
clergymen
were
rectors
and
others
not
ellen
marriott
assured
her
with
great
confidence
that
it
was
only
the
clever
men
who
were
made
rectors
ellen
marriott
was
going
to
be
confirmed
she
was
a
short
fair
plump
girl
with
blue
eyes
and
sandy
hair
which
was
this
morning
arranged
in
taller
cannon
curls
than
usual
for
the
reception
of
the
episcopal
benediction
and
some
of
the
young
ladies
thought
her
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
school
but
others
gave
the
preference
to
her
rival
maria
gardner
who
was
much
taller
and
had
a
lovely
of
ringlets
and
who
being
also
about
to
take
upon
herself
the
vows
made
in
her
name
at
her
baptism
had
oiled
and
twisted
her
ringlets
with
especial
care
as
she
seated
herself
at
the
before
miss
townley
entrance
to
dispense
the
weak
coffee
her
crop
excited
so
strong
a
sensation
that
ellen
marriott
was
at
length
impelled
to
look
at
it
and
to
say
with
suppressed
but
bitter
sarcasm
that
miss
gardner
head
said
maria
amiable
and
stuttering
and
no
match
for
ellen
in
retort
th
this
is
my
head
i
do
admire
it
at
all
was
the
crushing
rejoinder
of
ellen
followed
by
a
murmur
of
approval
among
her
friends
young
ladies
i
suppose
exhaust
their
sac
of
venom
in
this
way
at
school
that
is
the
reason
why
they
have
such
a
harmless
tooth
for
each
other
in
after
life
the
only
other
candidate
for
confirmation
at
miss
townley
was
mary
dunn
a
draper
daughter
in
milby
and
a
distant
relation
of
the
miss
linnets
her
pale
lanky
hair
could
never
be
coaxed
into
permanent
curl
and
this
morning
the
heat
had
brought
it
down
to
its
natural
condition
of
lankiness
earlier
than
usual
but
that
was
not
what
made
her
sit
melancholy
and
apart
at
the
lower
end
of
the
form
her
parents
were
admirers
of
tryan
and
had
been
persuaded
by
the
miss
influence
to
insist
that
their
daughter
should
be
prepared
for
confirmation
by
him
over
and
above
the
preparation
given
to
miss
townley
pupils
by
crewe
poor
mary
dunn
i
am
afraid
she
thought
it
too
heavy
a
price
to
pay
for
these
spiritual
advantages
to
be
excluded
from
every
game
at
ball
to
be
obliged
to
walk
with
none
but
little
girls
in
fact
to
be
the
object
of
an
aversion
that
nothing
short
of
an
incessant
supply
of
plumcakes
would
have
neutralized
and
dunn
was
of
opinion
that
plumcake
was
unwholesome
the
spirit
you
perceive
was
very
strong
at
miss
townley
imported
probably
by
day
scholars
as
well
as
encouraged
by
the
fact
that
that
clever
woman
was
herself
strongly
opposed
to
innovation
and
remarked
every
sunday
that
crewe
had
preached
an
discourse
poor
mary
dunn
dreaded
the
moment
when
would
be
over
for
then
she
was
sure
to
be
the
butt
of
those
very
explicit
remarks
which
in
young
ladies
as
well
as
young
gentlemen
seminaries
constitute
the
most
subtle
and
delicate
form
of
the
innuendo
never
be
a
tryanite
would
you
here
comes
the
lady
that
knows
so
much
more
about
religion
than
we
do
people
think
themselves
so
very
pious
it
is
really
surprising
that
young
ladies
should
not
be
thought
competent
to
the
same
curriculum
as
young
gentlemen
i
observe
that
their
powers
of
sarcasm
are
quite
equal
and
if
there
had
been
a
genteel
academy
for
young
gentlemen
at
milby
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
notwithstanding
euclid
and
the
classics
the
party
spirit
there
would
not
have
exhibited
itself
in
more
pungent
irony
or
more
incisive
satire
than
was
heard
in
miss
townley
seminary
but
there
was
no
such
academy
the
existence
of
the
under
crewe
superintendence
probably
discouraging
speculations
of
that
kind
and
the
genteel
youths
of
milby
were
chiefly
come
home
for
the
midsummer
holidays
from
distant
schools
several
of
us
had
just
assumed
and
the
assumption
of
new
responsibilities
apparently
following
as
a
matter
of
course
we
were
among
the
candidates
for
confirmation
i
wish
i
could
say
that
the
solemnity
of
our
feelings
was
on
a
level
with
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
but
unimaginative
boys
find
it
difficult
to
recognize
apostolical
institutions
in
their
developed
form
and
i
fear
our
chief
emotion
concerning
the
ceremony
was
a
sense
of
sheepishness
and
our
chief
opinion
the
speculative
and
heretical
position
that
it
ought
to
be
confined
to
the
girls
it
was
a
pity
you
will
say
but
it
is
the
way
with
us
men
in
other
crises
that
come
a
long
while
after
confirmation
the
golden
moments
in
the
stream
of
life
rush
past
us
and
we
see
nothing
but
sand
the
angels
come
to
visit
us
and
we
only
know
them
when
they
are
gone
but
as
i
said
the
morning
was
sunny
the
bells
were
ringing
the
ladies
of
milby
were
dressed
in
their
sunday
garments
and
who
is
this
woman
walking
with
hasty
step
along
orchard
street
so
early
with
a
large
nosegay
in
her
hand
can
it
be
janet
dempster
on
whom
we
looked
with
such
deep
pity
one
sad
midnight
hardly
a
fortnight
ago
yes
no
other
woman
in
milby
has
those
searching
black
eyes
that
tall
graceful
unconstrained
figure
set
off
by
her
simple
muslin
dress
and
black
lace
shawl
that
massy
black
hair
now
so
neatly
braided
in
glossy
contrast
with
the
white
satin
ribbons
of
her
modest
cap
and
bonnet
no
other
woman
has
that
sweet
speaking
smile
with
which
she
nods
to
jonathan
lamb
the
old
parish
clerk
and
ah
now
she
comes
nearer
there
are
those
sad
lines
about
the
mouth
and
eyes
on
which
that
sweet
smile
plays
like
sunbeams
on
the
beauty
of
the
full
and
ripened
corn
she
is
turning
out
of
orchard
street
and
making
her
way
as
fast
as
she
can
to
her
mother
house
a
pleasant
cottage
facing
a
roadside
meadow
from
which
the
hay
is
being
carried
raynor
has
had
her
breakfast
and
is
seated
in
her
reading
when
janet
opens
the
door
saying
in
her
most
playful
voice
mother
i
come
to
show
myself
to
you
before
i
go
to
the
parsonage
have
i
put
on
my
pretty
cap
and
bonnet
to
satisfy
you
raynor
looked
over
her
spectacles
and
met
her
daughter
glance
with
eyes
as
dark
and
loving
as
her
own
she
was
a
much
smaller
woman
than
janet
both
in
figure
and
feature
the
chief
resemblance
lying
in
the
eyes
and
the
clear
brunette
complexion
the
mother
hair
had
long
been
grey
and
was
gathered
under
the
neatest
of
caps
made
by
her
own
clever
fingers
as
all
janet
caps
and
bonnets
were
too
they
were
fingers
for
raynor
had
supported
herself
in
her
widowhood
by
keeping
a
millinery
establishment
and
in
this
way
had
earned
money
enough
to
give
her
daughter
what
was
then
thought
a
education
as
well
as
to
save
a
sum
which
eked
out
by
her
sufficed
to
support
her
in
her
solitary
old
age
always
the
same
clean
neat
old
lady
dressed
in
black
silk
was
raynor
a
patient
brave
woman
who
bowed
with
resignation
under
the
burden
of
remembered
sorrow
and
bore
with
meek
fortitude
the
new
load
that
the
new
days
brought
with
them
bonnet
wants
pulling
a
trifle
forwarder
my
child
she
said
smiling
and
taking
off
her
spectacles
while
janet
at
once
knelt
down
before
her
and
waited
to
be
to
rights
as
she
would
have
done
when
she
was
a
child
going
straight
to
crewe
i
suppose
are
those
flowers
to
garnish
the
dishes
indeed
mother
this
is
a
nosegay
for
the
middle
of
the
table
sent
up
the
and
the
ham
we
had
cooked
at
our
house
yesterday
and
betty
is
coming
directly
with
the
garnish
and
the
plate
we
shall
get
our
good
crewe
through
her
troubles
famously
dear
tiny
woman
you
should
have
seen
her
lift
up
her
hands
yesterday
and
pray
heaven
to
take
her
before
ever
she
should
have
another
collation
to
get
ready
for
the
bishop
she
said
it
bad
enough
to
have
the
archdeacon
though
he
does
want
half
so
many
i
would
mind
janet
if
it
was
to
feed
all
the
old
hungry
cripples
in
milby
but
so
much
trouble
and
expense
for
people
who
eat
too
much
every
day
of
their
lives
we
had
such
a
cleaning
and
of
the
yesterday
nothing
will
ever
do
away
with
the
smell
of
crewe
pipes
you
know
but
we
have
thrown
it
into
the
background
with
yellow
soap
and
dry
lavender
and
now
i
must
run
away
you
will
come
to
church
mother
my
dear
i
would
lose
such
a
pretty
sight
it
does
my
old
eyes
good
to
see
so
many
fresh
young
faces
is
your
husband
going
robert
will
be
there
i
made
him
as
neat
as
a
new
pin
this
morning
and
he
says
the
bishop
will
think
him
too
buckish
by
half
i
took
him
into
mammy
dempster
room
to
show
himself
we
hear
tryan
is
making
sure
of
the
bishop
support
but
we
shall
see
i
would
give
my
crooked
guinea
and
all
the
luck
it
will
ever
bring
me
to
have
him
beaten
for
i
ca
endure
the
sight
of
the
man
coming
to
harass
dear
old
and
crewe
in
their
last
days
preaching
the
gospel
indeed
that
is
the
best
gospel
that
makes
everybody
happy
and
comfortable
is
it
mother
child
i
afraid
there
no
gospel
will
do
that
here
below
i
can
do
something
to
comfort
crewe
at
least
so
give
me
a
kiss
and
till
the
mother
leaned
back
in
her
chair
when
janet
was
gone
and
sank
into
a
painful
reverie
when
our
life
is
a
continuous
trial
the
moments
of
respite
seem
only
to
substitute
the
heaviness
of
dread
for
the
heaviness
of
actual
suffering
the
curtain
of
cloud
seems
parted
an
instant
only
that
we
may
measure
all
its
horror
as
it
hangs
low
black
and
imminent
in
contrast
with
the
transient
brightness
the
water
drops
that
visit
the
parched
lips
in
the
desert
bear
with
them
only
the
keen
imagination
of
thirst
janet
looked
glad
and
tender
now
but
what
scene
of
misery
was
coming
next
she
was
too
like
the
cistus
flowers
in
the
little
garden
before
the
window
that
with
the
shades
of
evening
might
lie
with
the
delicate
white
and
glossy
dark
of
their
petals
trampled
in
the
roadside
dust
when
the
sun
had
sunk
and
the
twilight
was
deepening
janet
might
be
sitting
there
heated
maddened
sobbing
out
her
griefs
with
selfish
passion
and
wildly
wishing
herself
dead
raynor
had
been
reading
about
the
lost
sheep
and
the
joy
there
is
in
heaven
over
the
sinner
that
repenteth
surely
the
eternal
love
she
believed
in
through
all
the
sadness
of
her
lot
would
not
leave
her
child
to
wander
farther
and
farther
into
the
wilderness
till
here
was
no
turning
the
child
so
lovely
so
pitiful
to
others
so
good
till
she
was
goaded
into
sin
by
woman
bitterest
sorrows
raynor
had
her
faith
and
her
spiritual
comforts
though
she
was
not
in
the
least
evangelical
and
knew
nothing
of
doctrinal
zeal
i
fear
most
of
tryan
hearers
would
have
considered
her
destitute
of
saving
knowledge
and
i
am
quite
sure
she
had
no
views
on
justification
nevertheless
she
read
her
bible
a
great
deal
and
thought
she
found
divine
lessons
there
how
to
bear
the
cross
meekly
and
be
merciful
let
us
hope
that
there
is
a
saving
ignorance
and
that
raynor
was
justified
without
knowing
exactly
how
she
tried
to
have
hope
and
trust
though
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
the
future
would
be
anything
else
than
the
harvest
of
the
seed
that
was
being
sown
before
her
eyes
but
always
there
is
seed
being
sown
silently
and
unseen
and
everywhere
there
come
sweet
flowers
without
our
foresight
or
labour
we
reap
what
we
sow
but
nature
has
love
over
and
above
that
justice
and
gives
us
shadow
and
blossom
and
fruit
that
spring
from
no
planting
of
ours
chapter
most
people
must
have
agreed
with
raynor
that
the
confirmation
that
day
was
a
pretty
sight
at
least
when
those
slight
girlish
forms
and
fair
young
faces
moved
in
a
white
rivulet
along
the
aisles
and
flowed
into
kneeling
semicircles
under
the
light
of
the
great
chancel
window
softened
by
patches
of
dark
old
painted
glass
and
one
would
think
that
to
look
on
while
a
pair
of
venerable
hands
pressed
such
young
heads
and
a
venerable
face
looked
upward
for
a
blessing
on
them
would
be
very
likely
to
make
the
heart
swell
gently
and
to
moisten
the
eyes
yet
i
remember
the
eyes
seemed
very
dry
in
milby
church
that
day
notwithstanding
that
the
bishop
was
an
old
man
and
probably
venerable
for
though
he
was
not
an
eminent
grecian
he
was
the
brother
of
a
whig
lord
and
i
think
the
eyes
must
have
remained
dry
because
he
had
small
delicate
womanish
hands
adorned
with
ruffles
and
instead
of
laying
them
on
the
girls
heads
just
let
them
hover
over
each
in
quick
succession
as
if
it
were
not
etiquette
to
touch
them
and
as
if
the
laying
on
of
hands
were
like
the
theatrical
embrace
part
of
the
play
and
not
to
be
really
believed
in
to
be
sure
there
were
a
great
many
heads
and
the
bishop
time
was
limited
moreover
a
wig
can
under
no
circumstances
be
affecting
except
in
rare
cases
of
illusion
and
copious
can
not
be
expected
to
go
directly
to
any
heart
except
a
washerwoman
i
know
ned
phipps
who
knelt
against
me
and
i
am
sure
made
me
behave
much
worse
than
i
should
have
done
without
him
whispered
that
he
thought
the
bishop
was
a
and
i
certainly
remember
thinking
that
prendergast
looked
much
more
dignified
with
his
plain
white
surplice
and
black
hair
he
was
a
tall
commanding
man
and
read
the
liturgy
in
a
strikingly
sonorous
and
uniform
voice
which
i
tried
to
imitate
the
next
sunday
at
home
until
my
little
sister
began
to
cry
and
said
i
was
at
her
tryan
sat
in
a
pew
near
the
pulpit
with
several
other
clergymen
he
looked
pale
and
rubbed
his
hand
over
his
face
and
pushed
back
his
hair
oftener
than
usual
standing
in
the
aisle
close
to
him
and
repeating
the
responses
with
edifying
loudness
was
budd
churchwarden
and
delegate
with
a
white
staff
in
his
hand
and
a
backward
bend
of
his
small
head
and
person
such
as
i
suppose
he
considered
suitable
to
a
friend
of
sound
religion
conspicuous
in
the
gallery
too
was
the
tall
figure
of
dempster
whose
professional
avocations
rarely
allowed
him
to
occupy
his
place
at
church
dempster
said
linnet
to
her
daughter
mary
more
respectable
than
usual
i
declare
he
got
a
fine
speech
by
heart
to
make
to
the
bishop
i
answer
for
it
but
he
be
pretty
well
sprinkled
with
snuff
before
service
is
over
and
the
bishop
wo
be
able
to
listen
to
him
for
sneezing
that
one
comfort
at
length
the
last
stage
in
the
long
ceremony
was
over
the
large
assembly
streamed
warm
and
weary
into
the
open
afternoon
sunshine
and
the
bishop
retired
to
the
parsonage
where
after
honouring
collation
he
was
to
give
audience
to
the
delegates
and
tryan
on
the
great
question
of
the
evening
lecture
between
five
and
six
the
parsonage
was
once
more
as
quiet
as
usual
under
the
shadow
of
its
tall
elms
and
the
only
traces
of
the
bishop
recent
presence
there
were
the
wheel
marks
on
the
gravel
and
the
long
table
with
its
garnished
dishes
awry
its
damask
sprinkled
with
crumbs
and
its
decanters
without
their
stoppers
crewe
was
already
calmly
smoking
his
pipe
in
the
opposite
and
janet
was
agreeing
with
crewe
that
some
of
the
would
be
a
nice
thing
to
take
to
sally
martin
while
the
little
old
lady
herself
had
a
spoon
in
her
hand
ready
to
gather
the
crumbs
into
a
plate
that
she
might
scatter
them
on
the
gravel
for
the
little
birds
before
that
time
the
bishop
carriage
had
been
seen
driving
through
the
high
street
on
its
way
to
lord
trufford
where
he
was
to
dine
the
question
of
the
lecture
was
decided
then
the
nature
of
the
decision
may
be
gathered
from
the
following
conversation
which
took
place
in
the
bar
of
the
red
lion
that
evening
you
done
eh
dempster
was
pilgrim
observation
uttered
with
some
gusto
he
was
not
glad
tryan
had
gained
his
point
but
he
was
not
sorry
dempster
was
disappointed
sir
not
at
all
it
is
what
i
anticipated
i
knew
we
had
nothing
else
to
expect
in
these
days
when
the
church
is
infested
by
a
set
of
men
who
are
only
fit
to
give
out
hymns
from
an
empty
cask
to
tunes
set
by
a
journeyman
cobbler
but
i
was
not
the
less
to
exert
myself
in
the
cause
of
sound
churchmanship
for
the
good
of
the
town
any
coward
can
fight
a
battle
when
he
sure
of
winning
but
give
me
the
man
who
has
pluck
to
fight
when
he
sure
of
losing
that
my
way
sir
and
there
are
many
victories
worse
than
a
defeat
as
tryan
shall
learn
to
his
cost
must
be
a
poor
shuperannyated
sort
of
a
bishop
that
my
opinion
said
tomlinson
go
along
with
a
sneaking
methodist
like
tryan
and
for
my
part
i
think
we
should
be
as
well
bishops
if
no
wiser
than
that
where
the
use
o
havin
thousands
an
in
a
pallis
if
they
do
stick
to
the
church
there
you
going
out
of
your
depth
tomlinson
said
dempster
one
shall
hear
me
say
a
word
against
episcopacy
it
is
a
safeguard
of
the
church
we
must
have
ranks
and
dignities
there
as
well
as
everywhere
else
no
sir
episcopacy
is
a
good
thing
but
it
may
happen
that
a
bishop
is
not
a
good
thing
just
as
brandy
is
a
good
thing
though
this
particular
brandy
is
british
and
tastes
like
sugared
caught
down
the
chimney
here
ratcliffe
let
me
have
something
to
drink
a
little
less
like
a
decoction
of
sugar
and
soot
said
nothing
again
episcopacy
returned
tomlinson
only
said
i
thought
we
should
do
as
well
bishops
an
i
say
it
again
for
the
matter
o
that
bishops
never
brought
any
grist
to
my
mill
you
know
when
the
lectures
are
to
begin
said
pilgrim
are
to
on
sunday
next
said
dempster
in
a
significant
tone
i
think
it
will
not
take
a
prophet
to
foresee
the
end
of
them
it
strikes
me
tryan
will
be
looking
out
for
another
curacy
shortly
not
get
many
milby
people
to
go
and
hear
his
lectures
after
a
while
i
bet
a
guinea
observed
budd
know
i
not
keep
a
single
workman
on
my
ground
who
either
goes
to
the
lecture
himself
or
lets
anybody
belonging
to
him
go
me
nayther
said
tomlinson
tryanite
shall
touch
a
sack
or
drive
a
waggon
o
mine
that
you
may
depend
on
an
i
know
more
besides
me
as
are
o
the
same
mind
has
a
good
many
friends
in
the
town
though
and
friends
that
are
likely
to
stand
by
him
too
said
pilgrim
should
say
it
would
be
as
well
to
let
him
and
his
lectures
alone
if
he
goes
on
preaching
as
he
does
with
such
a
constitution
as
his
he
get
a
relaxed
throat
and
you
be
rid
of
him
without
any
trouble
not
allow
him
to
do
himself
that
injury
said
dempster
his
health
is
not
good
we
persuade
him
to
try
change
of
air
depend
upon
it
he
find
the
climate
of
milby
too
hot
for
him
chapter
dempster
did
not
stay
long
at
the
red
lion
that
evening
he
was
summoned
home
to
meet
armstrong
a
wealthy
client
and
as
he
was
kept
in
consultation
till
a
late
hour
it
happened
that
this
was
one
of
the
nights
on
which
dempster
went
to
bed
tolerably
sober
thus
the
day
which
had
been
one
of
janets
happiest
because
it
had
been
spent
by
her
in
helping
her
dear
old
friend
crewe
ended
for
her
with
unusual
quietude
and
as
a
bright
sunset
promises
a
fair
morning
so
a
calm
lying
down
is
a
good
augury
for
a
calm
waking
dempster
on
the
thursday
morning
was
in
one
of
his
best
humours
and
though
perhaps
some
of
the
might
result
from
the
prospect
of
a
lucrative
and
exciting
bit
of
business
in
armstrong
probable
lawsuit
the
greater
part
of
it
was
doubtless
due
to
those
stirrings
of
the
more
kindly
healthy
sap
of
human
feeling
by
which
goodness
tries
to
get
the
upper
hand
in
us
whenever
it
seems
to
have
the
slightest
chance
on
sunday
mornings
perhaps
when
we
are
set
free
from
the
grinding
hurry
of
the
week
and
take
the
little
old
on
our
knee
at
breakfast
to
share
our
egg
and
muffin
in
moments
of
trouble
when
death
visits
our
roof
or
illness
makes
us
dependent
on
the
tending
hand
of
a
slighted
wife
in
quiet
talks
with
an
aged
mother
of
the
days
when
we
stood
at
her
knee
with
our
first
or
wrote
her
loving
letters
from
school
in
the
man
whose
childhood
has
known
caresses
there
is
always
a
fibre
of
memory
that
can
be
touched
to
gentle
issues
and
dempster
whom
you
have
hitherto
seen
only
as
the
orator
of
the
red
lion
and
the
drunken
tyrant
of
a
dreary
midnight
home
was
the
darling
son
of
a
fair
little
mother
that
mother
was
living
still
and
her
own
large
black
where
she
sat
knitting
through
the
livelong
day
was
now
set
ready
for
her
at
the
by
her
son
side
a
sleek
cat
acting
as
provisional
incumbent
morning
mamsey
why
you
looking
as
fresh
as
a
daisy
this
morning
you
getting
young
again
said
dempster
looking
up
from
his
newspaper
when
the
little
old
lady
entered
a
very
little
old
lady
she
was
with
a
pale
scarcely
wrinkled
face
hair
of
that
peculiar
white
which
tells
that
the
locks
have
once
been
blond
a
natty
pure
white
cap
on
her
head
and
a
white
shawl
pinned
over
her
shoulders
you
saw
at
a
glance
that
she
had
been
a
mignonne
blonde
strangely
unlike
her
tall
ugly
son
unlike
her
too
whose
brunette
beauty
seemed
always
thrown
into
higher
relief
by
the
white
presence
of
little
mamsey
the
unlikeness
between
janet
and
her
went
deeper
than
outline
and
complexion
and
indeed
there
was
little
sympathy
between
them
for
old
dempster
had
not
yet
learned
to
believe
that
her
son
robert
would
have
gone
wrong
if
he
had
married
the
right
woman
a
meek
woman
like
herself
who
would
have
borne
him
children
and
been
a
deft
orderly
housekeeper
in
spite
of
tenderness
and
attention
to
her
she
had
had
little
love
for
her
from
the
first
and
had
witnessed
the
sad
growth
of
through
long
years
always
with
a
disposition
to
lay
the
blame
on
the
wife
rather
than
on
the
husband
and
to
reproach
raynor
for
encouraging
her
daughter
faults
by
a
too
exclusive
sympathy
but
old
dempster
had
that
rare
gift
of
silence
and
passivity
which
often
supplies
the
absence
of
mental
strength
and
whatever
were
her
thoughts
she
said
no
word
to
aggravate
the
domestic
discord
patient
and
mute
she
sat
at
her
knitting
through
many
a
scene
of
quarrel
and
anguish
resolutely
she
appeared
unconscious
of
the
sounds
that
reached
her
ears
and
the
facts
she
divined
after
she
had
retired
to
her
bed
mutely
she
witnessed
poor
janet
faults
only
registering
them
as
a
balance
of
excuse
on
the
side
of
her
son
the
hard
astute
domineering
attorney
was
still
that
little
old
woman
pet
as
he
had
been
when
she
watched
with
triumphant
pride
his
first
tumbling
effort
to
march
alone
across
the
nursery
floor
what
a
good
son
he
is
to
me
she
often
thought
gave
me
a
harsh
word
and
so
he
might
have
been
a
good
husband
o
it
is
piteous
that
sorrow
of
aged
women
in
early
youth
perhaps
they
said
to
themselves
shall
be
happy
when
i
have
a
husband
to
love
me
best
of
all
then
when
the
husband
was
too
careless
child
will
comfort
me
then
through
the
mother
watching
and
toil
child
will
repay
me
all
when
it
grows
up
and
at
last
after
the
long
journey
of
years
has
been
wearily
travelled
through
the
mother
heart
is
weighed
down
by
a
heavier
burthen
and
no
hope
remains
but
the
grave
but
this
morning
old
dempster
sat
down
in
her
without
any
painful
suppressed
remembrance
of
the
night
declare
mammy
looks
younger
than
crewe
who
is
only
said
janet
crewe
will
come
to
see
you
today
mammy
and
tell
you
all
about
her
troubles
with
the
bishop
and
the
collation
she
bring
her
knitting
and
you
have
a
regular
gossip
together
gossip
will
be
all
on
one
side
then
for
crewe
gets
so
very
deaf
i
ca
make
her
hear
a
word
and
if
i
motion
to
her
she
always
understands
me
wrong
she
will
have
so
much
to
tell
you
today
you
will
not
want
to
speak
yourself
you
who
have
patience
to
knit
those
wonderful
counterpanes
mammy
must
not
be
impatient
with
dear
crewe
good
old
lady
i
bear
her
to
think
she
ever
tiresome
to
people
and
you
know
she
very
ready
to
fancy
herself
in
the
way
i
think
she
would
like
to
shrink
up
to
the
size
of
a
mouse
that
she
might
run
about
and
do
people
good
without
their
noticing
her
is
patience
i
want
god
knows
it
lungs
to
speak
loud
enough
but
you
be
at
home
yourself
i
suppose
this
morning
and
you
can
talk
to
her
for
me
mammy
i
promised
poor
lowme
to
go
and
sit
with
her
confined
to
her
room
and
both
the
miss
lowmes
are
out
so
i
going
to
read
the
newspaper
to
her
and
amuse
her
you
go
another
morning
as
armstrong
and
that
other
gentleman
are
coming
to
dinner
i
should
think
it
would
be
better
to
stay
at
home
can
you
trust
betty
to
see
to
everything
she
new
to
the
place
i
could
disappoint
lowme
i
promised
her
betty
will
do
very
well
no
fear
old
dempster
was
silent
after
this
and
began
to
sip
her
tea
the
breakfast
went
on
without
further
conversation
for
some
time
dempster
being
absorbed
in
the
papers
at
length
when
he
was
running
over
the
advertisements
his
eye
seemed
to
be
caught
by
something
that
suggested
a
new
thought
to
him
he
presently
thumped
the
table
with
an
air
of
exultation
and
said
turning
to
janet
a
capital
idea
gypsy
that
was
his
name
for
his
wife
when
he
was
in
an
extraordinarily
good
humour
you
shall
help
me
it
just
what
you
up
to
is
it
said
janet
her
face
beaming
at
the
sound
of
the
pet
name
now
heard
so
seldom
to
do
with
conveyancing
a
bit
of
fun
worth
a
dozen
fees
a
plan
for
raising
a
laugh
against
tryan
and
his
gang
of
hypocrites
is
it
nothing
that
wants
a
needle
and
thread
hope
else
i
must
go
and
tease
mother
nothing
sharper
than
your
wit
except
mine
i
tell
you
what
it
is
we
get
up
a
programme
of
the
sunday
evening
lecture
like
a
you
know
grand
performance
of
the
celebrated
mountebank
and
so
on
we
bring
in
the
tryanites
old
landor
and
the
rest
in
appropriate
characters
proctor
shall
print
it
and
we
circulate
it
in
the
town
it
will
be
a
capital
hit
said
janet
clapping
her
hands
she
would
just
then
have
pretended
to
like
almost
anything
in
her
pleasure
at
being
appealed
to
by
her
husband
and
she
really
did
like
to
laugh
at
the
tryanites
set
about
it
directly
and
sketch
it
out
before
you
go
to
the
office
i
got
tryan
sermons
but
i
do
think
there
anything
in
them
we
can
use
i
only
just
looked
into
them
they
not
at
all
what
i
expected
dull
stupid
things
nothing
of
the
roaring
sort
that
i
expected
no
tryan
as
soft
as
a
sucking
dove
one
of
your
hypocrites
plenty
of
devil
and
malice
in
him
though
i
could
see
that
while
he
was
talking
to
the
bishop
but
as
smooth
as
a
snake
outside
he
beginning
a
fight
with
me
i
can
see
persuading
my
clients
away
from
me
we
shall
see
who
will
be
the
first
to
cry
milby
will
do
better
without
tryan
than
without
robert
dempster
i
fancy
and
milby
shall
never
be
flooded
with
cant
as
long
as
i
can
raise
a
breakwater
against
it
but
now
get
the
breakfast
things
cleared
away
and
let
us
set
about
the
come
mamsey
come
and
have
a
walk
with
me
round
the
garden
and
let
us
see
how
the
cucumbers
are
getting
on
i
never
taken
you
round
the
garden
for
an
age
come
you
do
want
a
bonnet
it
like
walking
in
a
greenhouse
this
morning
she
will
want
a
parasol
said
janet
one
on
the
stand
against
the
robert
the
little
old
lady
took
her
son
arm
with
placid
pleasure
she
could
barely
reach
it
so
as
to
rest
upon
it
but
he
inclined
a
little
towards
her
and
accommodated
his
heavy
steps
to
her
feeble
pace
the
cat
chose
to
sun
herself
too
and
walked
close
beside
them
with
tail
erect
rubbing
her
sleek
sides
against
their
legs
too
well
fed
to
be
excited
by
the
twittering
birds
the
garden
was
of
the
grassy
shady
kind
often
seen
attached
to
old
houses
in
provincial
towns
the
had
had
time
to
spread
their
branches
very
wide
the
shrubs
and
hardy
perennial
plants
had
grown
into
a
luxuriance
that
required
constant
trimming
to
prevent
them
from
intruding
on
the
space
for
walking
but
the
farther
end
which
united
with
green
fields
was
open
and
sunny
it
was
rather
sad
and
yet
pretty
to
see
that
little
group
passing
out
of
the
shadow
into
the
sunshine
and
out
of
the
sunshine
into
the
shadow
again
sad
because
this
tenderness
of
the
son
for
the
mother
was
hardly
more
than
a
nucleus
of
healthy
life
in
an
organ
hardening
by
disease
because
the
man
who
was
linked
in
this
way
with
an
innocent
past
had
become
callous
in
worldliness
fevered
by
sensuality
enslaved
by
chance
impulses
pretty
because
it
showed
how
hard
it
is
to
kill
the
fibrous
roots
of
human
love
and
goodness
how
the
man
from
whom
we
make
it
our
pride
to
shrink
has
yet
a
close
brotherhood
with
us
through
some
of
our
most
sacred
feelings
as
they
were
returning
to
the
house
janet
met
them
and
said
robert
the
writing
things
are
ready
i
shall
be
clerk
and
mat
paine
can
copy
it
out
after
mammy
once
more
deposited
in
her
with
her
knitting
in
her
hand
and
the
cat
purring
at
her
elbow
janet
seated
herself
at
the
table
while
dempster
placed
himself
near
her
took
out
his
and
plentifully
suffusing
himself
with
the
inspiring
powder
began
to
dictate
what
he
dictated
we
shall
see
chapter
the
next
day
friday
at
five
by
the
the
large
of
jerome
parlour
was
open
and
that
lady
herself
was
seated
within
its
ample
semicircle
having
a
table
before
her
on
which
her
best
her
best
china
and
her
best
had
already
been
standing
in
readiness
for
half
an
hour
jerome
best
was
of
delicate
white
fluted
china
with
gold
sprigs
upon
it
as
pretty
a
as
you
need
wish
to
see
and
quite
good
enough
for
chimney
ornaments
indeed
as
the
cups
were
without
handles
most
visitors
who
had
the
distinction
of
taking
tea
out
of
them
wished
that
such
charming
china
had
already
been
promoted
to
that
honorary
position
jerome
was
like
her
china
handsome
and
she
was
a
buxom
lady
of
sixty
in
an
elaborate
lace
cap
fastened
by
a
frill
under
her
chin
a
dark
front
concealing
her
forehead
a
snowy
neckerchief
exhibiting
its
ample
folds
as
far
as
her
waist
and
a
stiff
grey
silk
gown
she
had
a
clean
damask
napkin
pinned
before
her
to
guard
her
dress
during
the
process
of
her
favourite
geraniums
in
the
were
looking
as
healthy
as
she
could
desire
her
own
handsome
portrait
painted
when
she
was
twenty
years
younger
was
smiling
down
on
her
with
agreeable
flattery
and
altogether
she
seemed
to
be
in
as
peaceful
and
pleasant
a
position
as
a
buxom
elderly
lady
need
desire
but
as
in
so
many
other
cases
appearances
were
deceptive
her
mind
was
greatly
perturbed
and
her
temper
ruffled
by
the
fact
that
it
was
more
than
a
quarter
past
five
even
by
the
losing
timepiece
that
it
was
by
her
large
gold
watch
which
she
held
in
her
hand
as
if
she
were
counting
the
pulse
of
the
afternoon
and
that
by
the
kitchen
clock
which
she
felt
sure
was
not
an
hour
too
fast
it
had
already
struck
six
the
lapse
of
time
was
rendered
the
more
unendurable
to
jerome
by
her
wonder
that
jerome
could
stay
out
in
the
garden
with
lizzie
in
that
thoughtless
way
taking
it
so
easily
that
was
long
past
and
that
after
all
the
trouble
of
getting
down
the
best
tryan
would
not
come
this
honour
had
been
shown
to
tryan
not
at
all
because
jerome
had
any
high
appreciation
of
his
doctrine
or
of
his
exemplary
activity
as
a
pastor
but
simply
because
he
was
a
clergyman
and
as
such
was
regarded
by
her
with
the
same
sort
of
exceptional
respect
that
a
white
woman
who
had
married
a
native
of
the
society
islands
might
be
supposed
to
feel
towards
a
visitor
from
the
land
of
her
youth
for
jerome
had
been
reared
a
churchwoman
and
having
attained
the
age
of
thirty
before
she
was
married
had
felt
the
greatest
repugnance
in
the
first
instance
to
renouncing
the
religious
forms
in
which
she
had
been
brought
up
know
she
said
in
confidence
to
her
church
acquaintances
would
give
no
ear
at
all
to
jerome
at
fust
but
after
all
i
begun
to
think
as
there
was
a
maeny
things
worse
nor
to
chapel
an
you
better
do
that
nor
not
pay
your
way
jerome
had
a
very
pleasant
manner
with
him
an
there
was
niver
another
as
kept
a
gig
an
make
a
settlement
on
me
like
him
chapel
or
no
chapel
it
seemed
very
odd
to
me
for
a
long
while
the
preachin
without
book
the
stannin
up
to
one
long
prayer
istid
o
changin
your
postur
but
la
there
nothin
as
you
may
get
used
to
i
time
you
can
sit
down
you
know
before
the
prayer
done
the
ministers
say
pretty
nigh
the
same
things
as
the
church
parsons
by
what
i
could
iver
make
out
we
out
o
chapel
i
the
mornin
a
deal
sooner
nor
they
out
church
an
as
for
pews
ourn
is
a
deal
comfortabler
nor
aeny
i
milby
church
jerome
you
perceive
had
not
a
keen
susceptibility
to
shades
of
doctrine
and
it
is
probable
that
after
listening
to
dissenting
eloquence
for
thirty
years
she
might
safely
have
the
establishment
without
performing
any
spiritual
quarantine
her
mind
apparently
was
of
that
flinty
character
which
is
not
in
the
least
danger
from
surrounding
damp
but
on
the
question
of
getting
start
of
the
sun
on
the
day
business
and
clearing
her
conscience
of
the
necessary
sum
of
meals
and
the
consequent
up
as
soon
as
possible
so
that
the
family
might
be
well
in
bed
at
nine
jerome
susceptible
and
the
present
lingering
pace
of
things
united
with
jerome
unaccountable
obliviousness
was
not
to
be
borne
any
longer
so
she
rang
the
bell
for
sally
me
sally
go
into
the
garden
an
see
after
your
master
tell
him
it
goin
on
for
six
an
tryan
niver
think
o
comin
now
an
it
time
we
got
tea
over
an
he
lettin
lizzie
stain
her
frock
i
expect
among
them
strawberry
beds
mek
her
come
in
this
minute
no
wonder
jerome
was
tempted
to
linger
in
the
garden
for
though
the
house
was
pretty
and
well
deserved
its
name
white
house
the
tall
damask
roses
that
clustered
over
the
porch
being
thrown
into
relief
by
rough
stucco
of
the
most
brilliant
white
yet
the
garden
and
orchards
were
jerome
glory
as
well
they
might
be
and
there
was
nothing
in
which
he
had
a
more
innocent
pride
peace
to
a
good
man
memory
all
his
pride
was
innocent
than
in
conducting
a
hitherto
uninitiated
visitor
over
his
grounds
and
making
him
in
some
degree
aware
of
the
incomparable
advantages
possessed
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
white
house
in
the
matter
of
apples
russets
northern
greens
excellent
for
baking
pears
and
early
vegetables
to
say
nothing
of
flowering
pink
hawthorns
lavender
bushes
more
than
ever
jerome
could
use
and
in
short
a
superabundance
of
everything
that
a
person
retired
from
business
could
desire
to
possess
himself
or
to
share
with
his
friends
the
garden
was
one
of
those
paradises
which
hardly
exist
any
longer
except
as
memories
of
our
childhood
no
finical
separation
between
flower
and
kitchen
garden
there
no
monotony
of
enjoyment
for
one
sense
to
the
exclusion
of
another
but
a
charming
paradisiacal
mingling
of
all
that
was
pleasant
to
the
eyes
and
good
for
food
the
rich
running
along
every
walk
with
its
endless
succession
of
spring
flowers
anemones
auriculas
campanulas
snapdragons
and
had
its
taller
beauties
such
as
moss
and
provence
roses
varied
with
espalier
the
crimson
of
a
carnation
was
carried
out
in
the
lurking
crimson
of
the
neighbouring
you
gathered
a
one
moment
and
a
bunch
of
currants
the
next
you
were
in
a
delicious
fluctuation
between
the
scent
of
jasmine
and
the
juice
of
gooseberries
then
what
a
high
wall
at
one
end
flanked
by
a
so
lofty
that
after
ascending
its
long
flight
of
steps
you
could
see
perfectly
well
there
was
no
view
worth
looking
at
what
alcoves
and
in
all
directions
and
along
one
side
what
a
hedge
tall
and
firm
and
unbroken
like
a
green
wall
it
was
near
this
hedge
that
jerome
was
standing
when
sally
found
him
he
had
set
down
the
basket
of
strawberries
on
the
gravel
and
had
lifted
up
little
lizzie
in
his
arms
to
look
at
a
bird
nest
lizzie
peeped
and
then
looked
at
her
grandpa
with
round
blue
eyes
and
then
peeped
again
d
see
it
lizzie
he
whispered
she
whispered
in
return
putting
her
lips
very
near
face
at
this
moment
sally
appeared
eh
sally
what
the
matter
is
tryan

sir

missis

make
all
right
again
sally
regarding
the
from
a
different
point
of
view
looked
sourly
serious
and
hurried
away
with
lizzie
who
trotted
submissively
along
her
little
head
in
eclipse
under
a
large
nankin
bonnet
while
jerome
followed
leisurely
with
his
full
broad
shoulders
in
rather
a
stooping
posture
and
his
large
features
and
white
locks
shaded
by
a
hat
jerome
i
wonder
at
you
said
jerome
in
a
tone
of
indignant
remonstrance
evidently
sustained
by
a
deep
sense
of
injury
as
her
husband
opened
the
parlour
door
will

leave
off
invitin
people

but
let
me
tell
you
i
knowed
how
to
choose
chany
if
i
did
know
how
to
choose
a
husband
an
where
lizzie
you
niver

her
i
the
garden
by
herself
with
her
white
frock
on
an
clean
stockins
easy
my
dear
susan
be
easy
lizzie
come
in
wi
sally
hevin
her
pinafore
took
off
i
be
bound
ah
there
tryan
through
the
gate
jerome
began
hastily
to
adjust
her
damask
napkin
and
the
expression
of
her
countenance
for
the
reception
of
the
clergyman
and
jerome
went
out
to
meet
his
guest
whom
he
greeted
outside
the
door
tryan
how
do
you
do
tryan
welcome
to
the
white
house
glad
to
see
you
sir
i
glad
to
see
you
if
you
had
heard
the
tone
of
mingled
veneration
and
condolence
in
which
this
greeting
was
uttered
even
without
seeing
the
face
that
completely
harmonized
with
it
you
would
have
no
difficulty
in
inferring
the
of
jerome
character
to
a
fine
ear
that
tone
said
as
plainly
as
possible
recommends
itself
to
me
thomas
jerome
as
piety
and
goodness
shall
have
my
love
and
honour
ah
friends
this
pleasant
world
is
a
sad
one
too
is
it
let
us
help
one
another
let
us
help
one
another
and
it
was
entirely
owing
to
this
basis
of
character
not
at
all
from
any
clear
and
precise
doctrinal
discrimination
that
jerome
had
very
early
in
life
become
a
dissenter
in
his
boyish
days
he
had
been
thrown
where
dissent
seemed
to
have
the
balance
of
piety
purity
and
good
works
on
its
side
and
to
become
a
dissenter
seemed
to
him
identical
with
choosing
god
instead
of
mammon
that
race
of
dissenters
is
extinct
in
these
days
when
opinion
has
got
far
ahead
of
feeling
and
every
youth
can
fill
our
ears
with
the
advantages
of
the
voluntary
system
the
corruptions
of
a
state
church
and
the
scriptural
evidence
that
the
first
christians
were
congregationalists
jerome
knew
nothing
of
this
theoretic
basis
for
dissent
and
in
the
utmost
extent
of
his
polemical
discussion
he
had
not
gone
further
than
to
question
whether
a
christian
man
was
bound
in
conscience
to
distinguish
christmas
and
easter
by
any
peculiar
observance
beyond
the
eating
of
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
seasons
were
alike
good
for
thanking
god
departing
from
evil
and
doing
well
whereas
it
might
be
desirable
to
restrict
the
period
for
indulging
in
unwholesome
forms
of
pastry
jerome
dissent
being
of
this
simple
kind
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
the
report
he
heard
of
tryan
as
a
good
man
and
a
powerful
preacher
who
was
stirring
the
hearts
of
the
people
had
been
enough
to
attract
him
to
the
paddiford
church
and
that
having
felt
himself
more
edified
there
than
he
had
of
late
been
under
stickney
discourses
at
salem
he
had
driven
thither
repeatedly
in
the
sunday
afternoons
and
had
sought
an
opportunity
of
making
tryan
acquaintance
the
evening
lecture
was
a
subject
of
warm
interest
with
him
and
the
opposition
tryan
met
with
gave
that
interest
a
strong
tinge
of
partisanship
for
there
was
a
store
of
irascibility
in
jerome
nature
which
must
find
a
vent
somewhere
and
in
so
kindly
and
upright
a
man
could
only
find
it
in
indignation
against
those
whom
he
held
to
be
enemies
of
truth
and
goodness
tryan
had
not
hitherto
been
to
the
white
house
but
yesterday
meeting
jerome
in
the
street
he
had
at
once
accepted
the
invitation
to
tea
saying
there
was
something
he
wished
to
talk
about
he
appeared
worn
and
fatigued
now
and
after
shaking
hands
with
jerome
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
looked
out
on
the
pretty
garden
with
an
air
of
relief
a
nice
place
you
have
here
jerome
i
not
seen
anything
so
quiet
and
pretty
since
i
came
to
milby
on
paddiford
common
where
i
live
you
know
the
bushes
are
all
sprinkled
with
soot
and
there
never
any
quiet
except
in
the
dead
of
night
heart
dear
heart
that
very
bad
and
for
you
too
as
hev
to
study
would
it
be
better
for
you
to
be
somewhere
more
out
i
the
country
like
no
i
should
lose
so
much
time
in
going
to
and
fro
and
besides
i
like
to
be
the
people
i
no
face
to
go
and
preach
resignation
to
those
poor
things
in
their
smoky
air
and
comfortless
homes
when
i
come
straight
from
every
luxury
myself
there
are
many
things
quite
lawful
for
other
men
which
a
clergyman
must
forego
if
he
would
do
any
good
in
a
manufacturing
population
like
this
here
the
preparations
for
tea
were
crowned
by
the
simultaneous
appearance
of
lizzie
and
the
crumpet
it
is
a
pretty
surprise
when
one
visits
an
elderly
couple
to
see
a
little
figure
enter
in
a
white
frock
with
a
blond
head
as
smooth
as
satin
round
blue
eyes
and
a
cheek
like
an
apple
blossom
a
toddling
little
girl
is
a
centre
of
common
feeling
which
makes
the
most
dissimilar
people
understand
each
other
and
tryan
looked
at
lizzie
with
that
quiet
pleasure
which
is
always
genuine
we
are
here
we
are
said
proud
grandpapa
did
think
got
such
a
little
gell
as
this
did
you
tryan
why
it
seems
but
other
day
since
her
mother
was
just
such
another
this
is
our
little
lizzie
this
is
come
an
shake
hands
wi
tryan
lizzie
come
lizzie
advanced
without
hesitation
and
put
out
one
hand
while
she
fingered
her
coral
necklace
with
the
other
and
looked
up
into
tryan
face
with
a
reconnoitring
gaze
he
stroked
the
satin
head
and
said
in
his
gentlest
voice
do
you
do
lizzie
will
you
give
me
a
kiss
she
put
up
her
little
bud
of
a
mouth
and
then
retreating
a
little
and
glancing
down
at
her
frock
said
id
my
noo
fock
i
put
it
on
you
wad
toming
tally
taid
you
would
at
it
hush
lizzie
little
gells
must
be
seen
and
not
heard
said
jerome
while
grandpapa
winking
significantly
and
looking
radiant
with
delight
at
lizzie
extraordinary
promise
of
cleverness
set
her
up
on
her
high
by
the
side
of
grandma
who
lost
no
time
in
shielding
the
beauties
of
the
new
frock
with
a
napkin
now
tryan
said
jerome
in
a
very
serious
tone
when
tea
had
been
distributed
me
hear
how
you
on
about
the
lectur
when
i
was
i
the
town
yisterday
i
heared
as
there
was
pessecutin
schemes
laid
again
you
i
fear
me
those
raskills
mek
things
very
onpleasant
to
you
no
doubt
they
will
attempt
it
indeed
i
quite
expect
there
will
be
a
regular
mob
got
up
on
sunday
evening
as
there
was
when
the
delegates
returned
on
purpose
to
annoy
me
and
the
congregation
on
our
way
to
church
they
capible
o
anything
such
men
as
dempster
an
budd
tomlinson
backs
wi
money
though
he
ca
wi
brains
howiver
dempster
lost
one
client
by
his
wicked
doins
an
i
deceived
if
he
wo
lose
more
nor
one
i
little
thought
tryan
when
i
put
my
affairs
into
his
hands
twenty
ago
this
michaelmas
as
he
was
to
turn
out
a
pessecutor
o
religion
i
niver
lighted
on
a
cliverer
promisiner
young
man
nor
he
was
then
they
talked
of
his
bein
fond
of
a
extry
glass
now
an
then
but
niver
nothin
like
what
he
come
to
since
an
you
must
look
for
in
a
lawyer
tryan
it
his
wife
too
was
an
uncommon
favourite
o
mine
poor
thing
i
hear
sad
stories
about
her
now
but
she
druv
to
it
she
druv
to
it
tryan
a
woman
to
the
poor
she
is
as
iver
lived
an
as
a
woman
as
you
need
wish
to
talk
to
yes
i
a
likin
for
dempster
an
his
wife
spite
o
iverything
but
as
soon
as
iver
i
heared
o
that
dilegate
business
i
says
says
i
that
man
shall
hev
no
more
to
do
wi
my
affairs
it
may
put
me
t
inconvenience
but
i
encourage
no
man
as
pessecutes
religion
is
evidently
the
brain
and
hand
of
the
persecution
said
tryan
may
be
a
strong
feeling
against
me
in
a
large
number
of
the
inhabitants
it
must
be
so
from
the
great
ignorance
of
spiritual
things
in
this
place
but
i
fancy
there
would
have
been
no
formal
opposition
to
the
lecture
if
dempster
had
not
planned
it
i
am
not
myself
the
least
alarmed
at
anything
he
can
do
he
will
find
i
am
not
to
be
cowed
or
driven
away
by
insult
or
personal
danger
god
has
sent
me
to
this
place
and
by
his
blessing
i
not
shrink
from
anything
i
may
have
to
encounter
in
doing
his
work
among
the
people
but
i
feel
it
right
to
call
on
all
those
who
know
the
value
of
the
gospel
to
stand
by
me
publicly
i
think
and
landor
agrees
with
me
that
it
will
be
well
for
my
friends
to
proceed
with
me
in
a
body
to
the
church
on
sunday
evening
dempster
you
know
has
pretended
that
almost
all
the
respectable
inhabitants
are
opposed
to
the
lecture
now
i
wish
that
falsehood
to
be
visibly
contradicted
what
do
you
think
of
the
plan
i
have
today
been
to
see
several
of
my
friends

make
a

good

interferin

be
he
come
back
as
ill
as
ill
an
niver
let
me
hev
a
wink
o
sleep
all
night
jerome
had
been
frightened
at
the
mention
of
a
mob
and
her
retrospective
regard
for
the
religious
communion
of
her
youth
by
no
means
inspired
her
with
the
temper
of
a
martyr
her
husband
looked
at
her
with
an
expression
of
tender
and
grieved
remonstrance
which
might
have
been
that
of
the
patient
patriarch
on
the
memorable
occasion
when
he
rebuked
his
wife
susan
let
me
beg
on
you
not
to
oppose
me
and
put
i
the
way
o
doing
what
right
i
ca
give
up
my
conscience
let
me
give
up
what
else
i
may
said
tryan
feeling
slightly
uncomfortable
you
are
not
very
strong
my
dear
sir
it
will
be
well
as
jerome
suggests
that
you
should
not
run
the
risk
of
any
excitement
no
more
tryan
i
stan
by
you
sir
it
my
duty
it
the
cause
o
god
sir
it
the
cause
o
god
tryan
obeyed
his
impulse
of
admiration
and
gratitude
and
put
out
his
hand
to
the
old
man
saying
you
jerome
thank
you
jerome
grasped
the
proffered
hand
in
silence
and
then
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
casting
a
regretful
look
at
his
wife
which
seemed
to
say
do
you
feel
with
me
susan
the
sympathy
of
this
old
man
was
more
precious
to
tryan
than
any
mere
onlooker
could
have
imagined
to
persons
possessing
a
great
deal
of
that
facile
psychology
which
prejudges
individuals
by
means
of
formulae
and
casts
them
without
further
trouble
into
duly
lettered
the
evangelical
curate
might
seem
to
be
doing
simply
what
all
other
men
like
to
do
carrying
out
objects
which
were
identified
not
only
with
his
theory
which
is
but
a
kind
of
secondary
egoism
but
also
with
the
primary
egoism
of
his
feelings
opposition
may
become
sweet
to
a
man
when
he
has
christened
it
persecution
a
reformer
complacently
disclaiming
all
merit
while
his
friends
call
him
a
martyr
has
not
in
reality
a
career
the
most
arduous
to
the
fleshly
mind
but
tryan
was
not
cast
in
the
mould
of
the
gratuitous
martyr
with
a
power
of
persistence
which
had
been
often
blamed
as
obstinacy
he
had
an
acute
sensibility
to
the
very
hatred
or
ridicule
he
did
not
flinch
from
provoking
every
form
of
disapproval
jarred
him
painfully
and
though
he
fronted
his
opponents
manfully
and
often
with
considerable
warmth
of
temper
he
had
no
pugnacious
pleasure
in
the
contest
it
was
one
of
the
weaknesses
of
his
nature
to
be
too
keenly
alive
to
every
harsh
wind
of
opinion
to
wince
under
the
frowns
of
the
foolish
to
be
irritated
by
the
injustice
of
those
who
could
not
possibly
have
the
elements
indispensable
for
judging
him
rightly
and
with
all
this
acute
sensibility
to
blame
this
dependence
on
sympathy
he
had
for
years
been
constrained
into
a
position
of
antagonism
no
wonder
then
that
good
old
cordial
words
were
balm
to
him
he
had
often
been
thankful
to
an
old
woman
for
saying
bless
you
to
a
little
child
for
smiling
at
him
to
a
dog
for
submitting
to
be
patted
by
him
tea
being
over
by
this
time
tryan
proposed
a
walk
in
the
garden
as
a
means
of
dissipating
all
recollection
of
the
recent
conjugal
dissidence
little
lizzie
appeal
go
gandpa
could
not
be
rejected
so
she
was
duly
bonneted
and
pinafored
and
then
they
turned
out
into
the
evening
sunshine
not
jerome
however
she
had
a
plan
of
retiring
to
the
kitchen
and
washing
up
the
best
teathings
as
a
mode
of
getting
forward
with
the
business
of
the
day
way
tryan
this
way
said
the
old
gentleman

take

but
there
a
many
hours
atween

move
about
wi

good
many

here
the
pastur
a
very
pretty
pasture
it
was
where
the
cow
quietly
chewed
the
cud
as
she
lay
and
looked
sleepily
at
her
admirers
a
hedge
all
round
dotted
here
and
there
with
a
or
a
a
good
bit
more
land

worth

jerome
winked
and
smiled
significantly
that
puts
me
i
mind
tryan
o
summat
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
clergymen
like
you
i
know
see
a
deal
more
poverty
an
that
than
other
folks
an
hev
a
many
claims
on
more
nor
they
can
well
meet
an
if
you
mek
use
o
my
purse
any
time
or
let
me
know
where
i
can
be
o
any
help
i
tek
it
very
kind
on
you
you
jerome
i
will
do
so
i
promise
you
i
saw
a
sad
case
yesterday
a
collier
a
fine
fellow
about
thirty
was
killed
by
the
falling
of
a
wall
in
the
paddiford
colliery
i
was
in
one
of
the
cottages
near
when
they
brought
him
home
on
a
door
and
the
shriek
of
the
wife
has
been
ringing
in
my
ears
ever
since
there
are
three
little
children
happily
the
woman
has
her
loom
so
she
will
be
able
to
keep
out
of
the
workhouse
but
she
looks
very
delicate
me
her
name
tryan
said
jerome
drawing
out
his
call
an
see
her
deep
was
the
fountain
of
pity
in
the
good
old
man
heart
he
often
ate
his
dinner
stintingly
oppressed
by
the
thought
that
there
were
men
women
and
children
with
no
dinner
to
sit
down
to
and
would
relieve
his
mind
by
going
out
in
the
afternoon
to
look
for
some
need
that
he
could
supply
some
honest
struggle
in
which
he
could
lend
a
helping
hand
that
any
living
being
should
want
was
his
chief
sorrow
that
any
rational
being
should
waste
was
the
next
sally
indeed
having
been
scolded
by
master
for
a
too
lavish
use
of
sticks
in
lighting
the
kitchen
fire
and
various
instances
of
recklessness
with
regard
to
candle
ends
considered
him
mean
as
aenythink
but
he
had
as
kindly
a
warmth
as
the
morning
sunlight
and
like
the
sunlight
his
goodness
shone
on
all
that
came
in
his
way
from
the
saucy
lad
whom
he
delighted
to
make
happy
with
a
christmas
box
to
the
pallid
sufferers
up
dim
entries
languishing
under
the
tardy
death
of
want
and
misery
it
was
very
pleasant
to
tryan
to
listen
to
the
simple
chat
of
the
old
man
to
walk
in
the
shade
of
the
incomparable
orchard
and
hear
the
story
of
the
crops
yielded
by
the
and
the
quite
embarrassing
plentifulness
of
the
to
the
sweet
evening
breath
of
the
garden
as
they
sat
in
the
alcove
and
so
for
a
short
interval
to
feel
the
strain
of
his
pastoral
task
relaxed
perhaps
he
felt
the
return
to
that
task
through
the
dusty
roads
all
the
more
painfully
perhaps
something
in
that
quiet
shady
home
had
reminded
him
of
the
time
before
he
had
taken
on
him
the
yoke
of
the
strongest
heart
will
faint
sometimes
under
the
feeling
that
enemies
are
bitter
and
that
friends
only
know
half
its
sorrows
the
most
resolute
soul
will
now
and
then
cast
back
a
yearning
look
in
treading
the
rough
away
from
the
greensward
and
laughing
voices
of
the
valley
however
it
was
in
the
nine
twilight
that
evening
when
tryan
had
entered
his
small
study
and
turned
the
key
in
the
door
he
threw
himself
into
the
chair
before
his
and
heedless
of
the
papers
there
leaned
his
face
low
on
his
hand
and
moaned
heavily
it
is
apt
to
be
so
in
this
life
i
think
while
we
are
coldly
discussing
a
man
career
sneering
at
his
mistakes
blaming
his
rashness
and
labelling
his
opinions
is
evangelical
and
narrow
or
and
pantheistic
or
and
supercilious
that
man
in
his
solitude
is
perhaps
shedding
hot
tears
because
his
sacrifice
is
a
hard
one
because
strength
and
patience
are
failing
him
to
speak
the

chapter
tryan
showed
no
such
symptoms
of
weakness
on
the
critical
sunday
he
unhesitatingly
rejected
the
suggestion
that
he
should
be
taken
to
church
in
landor
carriage
a
proposition
which
that
gentleman
made
as
an
amendment
on
the
original
plan
when
the
rumours
of
meditated
insult
became
alarming
tryan
declared
he
would
have
no
precautions
taken
but
would
simply
trust
in
god
and
his
good
cause
some
of
his
more
timid
friends
thought
this
conduct
rather
defiant
than
wise
and
reflecting
that
a
mob
has
great
talents
for
impromptu
and
that
legal
redress
is
imperfect
satisfaction
for
having
one
head
broken
with
a
brickbat
were
beginning
to
question
their
consciences
very
closely
as
to
whether
it
was
not
a
duty
they
owed
to
their
families
to
stay
at
home
on
sunday
evening
these
timorous
persons
however
were
in
a
small
minority
and
the
generality
of
tryan
friends
and
hearers
rather
exulted
in
an
opportunity
of
braving
insult
for
the
sake
of
a
preacher
to
whom
they
were
attached
on
personal
as
well
as
doctrinal
grounds
miss
pratt
spoke
of
cranmer
ridley
and
latimer
and
observed
that
the
present
crisis
afforded
an
occasion
for
emulating
their
heroism
even
in
these
degenerate
times
while
less
highly
instructed
persons
whose
memories
were
not
well
stored
with
precedents
simply
expressed
their
determination
as
jerome
had
done
to
by
the
preacher
and
his
cause
believing
it
to
be
the
of
god
on
sunday
evening
then
at
a
quarter
past
six
tryan
setting
out
from
landor
with
a
party
of
his
friends
who
had
assembled
there
was
soon
joined
by
two
other
groups
from
pratt
and
dunn
and
stray
persons
on
their
way
to
church
naturally
falling
into
rank
behind
this
leading
file
by
the
time
they
reached
the
entrance
of
orchard
street
tryan
friends
formed
a
considerable
procession
walking
three
or
four
abreast
it
was
in
orchard
street
and
towards
the
church
gates
that
the
chief
crowd
was
collected
and
at
window
on
the
upper
floor
a
more
select
assembly
of
were
gathered
to
witness
the
entertaining
spectacle
of
the
tryanites
walking
to
church
amidst
the
jeers
and
hootings
of
the
crowd
to
prompt
the
popular
wit
with
appropriate
sobriquets
numerous
copies
of
dempster
were
posted
on
the
walls
in
suitably
large
and
emphatic
type
as
it
is
possible
that
the
most
industrious
collector
of
mural
literature
may
not
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
possess
himself
of
this
production
which
ought
by
all
means
to
be
preserved
amongst
the

this
satire
though
it
presents
the
keenest
edge
of
milby
wit
does
not
strike
you
as
lacerating
i
imagine
but
hatred
is
like
fire
it
makes
even
light
rubbish
deadly
and
dempster
sarcasms
were
not
merely
visible
on
the
walls
they
were
reflected
in
the
derisive
glances
and
audible
in
the
jeering
voices
of
the
crowd
through
this
pelting
shower
of
nicknames
and
bad
puns
with
an
accompaniment
of
groans
howls
hisses
and
but
of
no
heavier
missiles
tryan
walked
pale
and
composed
giving
his
arm
to
old
landor
whose
step
was
feeble
on
the
other
side
of
him
was
jerome
who
still
walked
firmly
though
his
shoulders
were
slightly
bowed
outwardly
tryan
was
composed
but
inwardly
he
was
suffering
acutely
from
these
tones
of
hatred
and
scorn
however
strong
his
consciousness
of
right
he
found
it
no
stronger
armour
against
such
weapons
as
derisive
glances
and
virulent
words
than
against
stones
and
clubs
his
conscience
was
in
repose
but
his
sensibility
was
bruised
once
more
only
did
the
evangelical
curate
pass
up
orchard
street
followed
by
a
train
of
friends
once
more
only
was
there
a
crowd
assembled
to
witness
his
entrance
through
the
church
gates
but
that
second
time
no
voice
was
heard
above
a
whisper
and
the
whispers
were
words
of
sorrow
and
blessing
that
second
time
janet
dempster
was
not
looking
on
in
scorn
and
merriment
her
eyes
were
worn
with
grief
and
watching
and
she
was
following
her
beloved
friend
and
pastor
to
the
grave
chapter
history
we
know
is
apt
to
repeat
herself
and
to
foist
very
old
incidents
upon
us
with
only
a
slight
change
of
costume
from
the
time
of
xerxes
downwards
we
have
seen
generals
playing
the
braggadocio
at
the
outset
of
their
campaigns
and
conquering
the
enemy
with
the
greatest
ease
in
speeches
but
events
are
apt
to
be
in
disgusting
discrepancy
with
the
anticipations
of
the
most
ingenious
tacticians
the
difficulties
of
the
expedition
are
ridiculously
at
variance
with
able
calculations
the
enemy
has
the
impudence
not
to
fall
into
confusion
as
had
been
reasonably
expected
of
him
the
mind
of
the
gallant
general
begins
to
be
distracted
by
news
of
intrigues
against
him
at
home
and
notwithstanding
the
handsome
compliments
he
paid
to
providence
as
his
undoubted
patron
before
setting
out
there
seems
every
probability
that
the
will
be
all
on
the
other
side
so
it
fell
out
with
dempster
in
his
memorable
campaign
against
the
tryanites
after
all
the
premature
triumph
of
the
return
from
elmstoke
the
battle
of
the
evening
lecture
had
been
lost
the
enemy
was
in
possession
of
the
field
and
the
utmost
hope
remaining
was
that
by
a
harassing
guerilla
warfare
he
might
be
driven
to
evacuate
the
country
for
some
time
this
sort
of
warfare
was
kept
up
with
considerable
spirit
the
shafts
of
milby
ridicule
were
made
more
formidable
by
being
poisoned
with
calumny
and
very
ugly
stories
narrated
with
circumstantial
minuteness
were
soon
in
circulation
concerning
tryan
and
his
hearers
from
which
stories
it
was
plainly
deducible
that
evangelicalism
led
by
a
necessary
consequence
to
hypocritical
indulgence
in
vice
some
old
friendships
were
broken
asunder
and
there
were
near
relations
who
felt
that
religious
differences
unmitigated
by
any
prospect
of
a
legacy
were
a
sufficient
ground
for
exhibiting
their
family
antipathy
budd
harangued
his
workmen
and
threatened
them
with
dismissal
if
they
or
their
families
were
known
to
attend
the
evening
lecture
and
tomlinson
on
discovering
that
his
foreman
was
a
rank
tryanite
blustered
to
a
great
extent
and
would
have
cashiered
that
valuable
functionary
on
the
spot
if
such
a
retributive
procedure
had
not
been
inconvenient
on
the
whole
however
at
the
end
of
a
few
months
the
balance
of
substantial
loss
was
on
the
side
of
the
pratt
indeed
had
lost
a
patient
or
two
besides
dempster
family
but
as
it
was
evident
that
evangelicalism
had
not
dried
up
the
stream
of
his
anecdote
or
in
the
least
altered
his
view
of
any
lady
constitution
it
is
probable
that
a
change
accompanied
by
so
few
outward
and
visible
signs
was
rather
the
pretext
than
the
ground
of
his
dismissal
in
those
additional
cases
dunn
was
threatened
with
the
loss
of
several
good
customers
phipps
and
lowme
having
set
the
example
of
ordering
him
to
send
in
his
bill
and
the
draper
began
to
look
forward
to
his
next
with
an
anxiety
which
was
but
slightly
mitigated
by
the
parallel
his
wife
suggested
between
his
own
case
and
that
of
shadrach
meshech
and
abednego
who
were
thrust
into
a
burning
fiery
furnace
for
as
he
observed
to
her
the
next
morning
with
that
perspicacity
which
belongs
to
the
period
of
shaving
whereas
their
deliverance
consisted
in
the
fact
that
their
linen
and
woollen
goods
were
not
consumed
his
own
deliverance
lay
in
precisely
the
opposite
result
but
convenience
that
admirable
branch
system
from
the
main
line
of
makes
us
all
in
spite
of
adverse
resolutions
it
is
probable
that
no
speculative
or
theological
hatred
would
be
ultimately
strong
enough
to
resist
the
persuasive
power
of
convenience
that
a
latitudinarian
baker
whose
bread
was
honourably
free
from
alum
would
command
the
custom
of
any
dyspeptic
puseyite
that
an
arminian
with
the
toothache
would
prefer
a
skilful
calvinistic
dentist
to
a
bungler
stanch
against
the
doctrines
of
election
and
final
perseverance
who
would
be
likely
to
break
the
tooth
in
his
head
and
that
a
plymouth
brother
who
had
a
well
furnished
grocery
shop
in
a
favourable
vicinage
would
occasionally
have
the
pleasure
of
furnishing
sugar
or
vinegar
to
orthodox
families
that
found
themselves
unexpectedly
of
those
indispensable
commodities
in
this
persuasive
power
of
convenience
lay
dunn
ultimate
security
from
martyrdom
his
drapery
was
the
best
in
milby
the
comfortable
use
and
wont
of
procuring
satisfactory
articles
at
a
moment
notice
proved
too
strong
for
zeal
and
the
draper
could
soon
look
forward
to
his
next
without
the
support
of
a
scriptural
parallel
on
the
other
hand
dempster
had
lost
his
excellent
client
jerome
a
loss
which
galled
him
out
of
proportion
to
the
mere
monetary
deficit
it
represented
the
attorney
loved
money
but
he
loved
power
still
better
he
had
always
been
proud
of
having
early
won
the
confidence
of
a
and
of
being
able
to
the
prop
of
salem
round
his
thumb
like
most
other
men
too
he
had
a
certain
kindness
towards
those
who
had
employed
him
when
he
was
only
starting
in
life
and
just
as
we
do
not
like
to
part
with
an
old
from
our
study
or
a
ruler
that
we
have
carried
in
our
pocket
ever
since
we
began
business
so
dempster
did
not
like
having
to
erase
his
old
name
from
the
accustomed
drawer
in
the
bureau
our
habitual
life
is
like
a
wall
hung
with
pictures
which
has
been
shone
on
by
the
suns
of
many
years
take
one
of
the
pictures
away
and
it
leaves
a
definite
blank
space
to
which
our
eyes
can
never
turn
without
a
sensation
of
discomfort
nay
the
involuntary
loss
of
any
familiar
object
almost
always
brings
a
chill
as
from
an
evil
omen
it
seems
to
be
the
first
of
advancing
death
from
all
these
causes
combined
dempster
could
never
think
of
his
lost
client
without
strong
irritation
and
the
very
sight
of
jerome
passing
in
the
street
was
wormwood
to
him
one
day
when
the
old
gentleman
was
coming
up
orchard
street
on
his
roan
mare
shaking
the
bridle
and
tickling
her
flank
with
the
whip
as
usual
though
there
was
a
perfect
mutual
understanding
that
she
was
not
to
quicken
her
pace
janet
happened
to
be
on
her
own
and
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
stopping
to
speak
to
that
little
woman
as
he
always
called
her
though
she
was
taller
than
all
the
rest
of
his
feminine
acquaintances
janet
in
spite
of
her
disposition
to
take
her
husband
part
in
all
public
matters
could
bear
no
malice
against
her
old
friend
so
they
shook
hands
dempster
i
sorry
to
my
heart
not
to
see
you
sometimes
that
i
am
said
jerome
in
a
plaintive
tone
if
you
got
any
poor
people
as
wants
help
and
you
know
deservin
send
to
me
send
to
me
just
the
same
you
jerome
that
i
will
janet
made
the
interview
as
short
as
she
could
but
it
was
not
short
enough
to
escape
the
observation
of
her
husband
who
as
she
feared
was
on
his
return
from
his
office
at
the
other
end
of
the
street
and
this
offence
of
hers
in
speaking
to
jerome
was
the
frequently
recurring
theme
of
dempster
objurgatory
domestic
eloquence
associating
the
loss
of
his
old
client
with
tryan
influence
dempster
began
to
know
more
distinctly
why
he
hated
the
obnoxious
curate
but
a
passionate
hate
as
well
as
a
passionate
love
demands
some
leisure
and
mental
freedom
persecution
and
revenge
like
courtship
and
toadyism
will
not
prosper
without
a
considerable
expenditure
of
time
and
ingenuity
and
these
are
not
to
spare
with
a
man
whose
and
liver
are
both
beginning
to
show
unpleasant
symptoms
such
was
the
disagreeable
turn
affairs
were
taking
with
dempster
and
like
the
general
distracted
by
home
intrigues
he
was
too
much
harassed
himself
to
lay
ingenious
plans
for
harassing
the
enemy
meanwhile
the
evening
lecture
drew
larger
and
larger
congregations
not
perhaps
attracting
many
from
that
select
aristocratic
circle
in
which
the
lowmes
and
pittmans
were
predominant
but
winning
the
larger
proportion
of
crewe
morning
and
afternoon
hearers
and
thinning
evening
audiences
at
salem
evangelicalism
was
making
its
way
in
milby
and
gradually
diffusing
its
subtle
odour
into
chambers
that
were
bolted
and
barred
against
it
the
movement
like
all
other
religious
had
a
mixed
effect
religious
ideas
have
the
fate
of
melodies
which
once
set
afloat
in
the
world
are
taken
up
by
all
sorts
of
instruments
some
of
them
woefully
coarse
feeble
or
out
of
tune
until
people
are
in
danger
of
crying
out
that
the
melody
itself
is
detestable
it
may
be
that
some
of
tryan
hearers
had
gained
a
religious
vocabulary
rather
than
religious
experience
that
here
and
there
a
weaver
wife
who
a
few
months
before
had
been
simply
a
silly
slattern
was
converted
into
that
more
complex
nuisance
a
silly
and
sanctimonious
slattern
that
the
old
adam
with
the
pertinacity
of
middle
age
continued
to
tell
fibs
behind
the
counter
notwithstanding
the
new
adam
addiction
to
and
family
prayer
that
the
children
in
the
paddiford
sunday
school
had
their
memories
crammed
with
phrases
about
the
blood
of
cleansing
imputed
righteousness
and
justification
by
faith
alone
which
an
experience
lying
principally
in
parental
slappings
and
longings
after
unattainable
lollypop
served
rather
to
darken
than
to
illustrate
and
that
at
milby
in
those
distant
days
as
in
all
other
times
and
places
where
the
mental
atmosphere
is
changing
and
men
are
inhaling
the
stimulus
of
new
ideas
folly
often
mistook
itself
for
wisdom
ignorance
gave
itself
airs
of
knowledge
and
selfishness
turning
its
eyes
upward
called
itself
religion
nevertheless
evangelicalism
had
brought
into
palpable
existence
and
operation
in
milby
society
that
idea
of
duty
that
recognition
of
something
to
be
lived
for
beyond
the
mere
satisfaction
of
self
which
is
to
the
moral
life
what
the
addition
of
a
great
central
ganglion
is
to
animal
life
no
man
can
begin
to
mould
himself
on
a
faith
or
an
idea
without
rising
to
a
higher
order
of
experience
a
principle
of
subordination
of
has
been
introduced
into
his
nature
he
is
no
longer
a
mere
bundle
of
impressions
desires
and
impulses
whatever
might
be
the
weaknesses
of
the
ladies
who
pruned
the
luxuriance
of
their
lace
and
ribbons
cut
out
garments
for
the

scripture
and
defined
the
true
gospel
they
had
learned
this
that
there
was
a
divine
work
to
be
done
in
life
a
rule
of
goodness
higher
than
the
opinion
of
their
neighbours
and
if
the
notion
of
a
heaven
in
reserve
for
themselves
was
a
little
too
prominent
yet
the
theory
of
fitness
for
that
heaven
consisted
in
purity
of
heart
in
compassion
in
the
subduing
of
selfish
desires
they
might
give
the
name
of
piety
to
much
that
was
only
puritanic
egoism
they
might
call
many
things
sin
that
were
not
sin
but
they
had
at
least
the
feeling
that
sin
was
to
be
avoided
and
resisted
and
which
may
mistake
drab
for
scarlet
is
better
than
total
blindness

linnet
in
quiet
attire
with
a
somewhat
excessive
solemnity
of
countenance
teaching
at
the
sunday
school
visiting
the
poor
and
striving
after
a
standard
of
purity
and
goodness
had
surely
more
moral
loveliness
than
in
those
flaunting
when
she
had
no
other
model
than
the
costumes
of
the
heroines
in
the
circulating
library
miss
eliza
pratt
listening
in
rapt
attention
to
tryan
evening
lecture
no
doubt
found
evangelical
channels
for
vanity
and
egoism
but
she
was
clearly
in
moral
advance
of
miss
phipps
giggling
under
her
feathers
at
old
crewe
peculiarities
of
enunciation
and
even
elderly
fathers
and
mothers
with
minds
like
linnet
too
tough
to
imbibe
much
doctrine
were
the
better
for
having
their
hearts
inclined
towards
the
new
preacher
as
a
messenger
from
god
they
became
ashamed
perhaps
of
their
evil
tempers
ashamed
of
their
worldliness
ashamed
of
their
trivial
futile
past
the
first
condition
of
human
goodness
is
something
to
love
the
second
something
to
reverence
and
this
latter
precious
gift
was
brought
to
milby
by
tryan
and
evangelicalism
yes
the
movement
was
good
though
it
had
that
mixture
of
folly
and
evil
which
often
makes
what
is
good
an
offence
to
feeble
and
fastidious
minds
who
want
human
actions
and
characters
riddled
through
the
sieve
of
their
own
ideas
before
they
can
accord
their
sympathy
or
admiration
such
minds
i
daresay
would
have
found
tryan
character
very
much
in
need
of
that
riddling
process
the
blessed
work
of
helping
the
world
forward
happily
does
not
wait
to
be
done
by
perfect
men
and
i
should
imagine
that
neither
luther
nor
john
bunyan
for
example
would
have
satisfied
the
modern
demand
for
an
ideal
hero
who
believes
nothing
but
what
is
true
feels
nothing
but
what
is
exalted
and
does
nothing
but
what
is
graceful
the
real
heroes
of
god
making
are
quite
different
they
have
their
natural
heritage
of
love
and
conscience
which
they
drew
in
with
their
mother
milk
they
know
one
or
two
of
those
deep
spiritual
truths
which
are
only
to
be
won
by
long
wrestling
with
their
own
sins
and
their
own
sorrows
they
have
earned
faith
and
strength
so
far
as
they
have
done
genuine
work
but
the
rest
is
dry
barren
theory
blank
prejudice
vague
hearsay
their
insight
is
blended
with
mere
opinion
their
sympathy
is
perhaps
confined
in
narrow
conduits
of
doctrine
instead
of
flowing
forth
with
the
freedom
of
a
stream
that
blesses
every
weed
in
its
course
obstinacy
or
will
often
interfuse
itself
with
their
grandest
impulses
and
their
very
deeds
of
are
sometimes
only
the
rebound
of
a
passionate
egoism
so
it
was
with
tryan
and
any
one
looking
at
him
with
the
glance
of
a
critic
might
perhaps
say
that
he
made
the
mistake
of
identifying
christianity
with
a
too
narrow
doctrinal
system
that
he
saw
god
work
too
exclusively
in
antagonism
to
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
that
his
intellectual
culture
was
too
limited
and
so
on
making
tryan
the
text
for
a
wise
discourse
on
the
characteristics
of
the
evangelical
school
in
his
day
but
i
am
not
poised
at
that
lofty
height
i
am
on
the
level
and
in
the
press
with
him
as
he
struggles
his
way
along
the
stony
road
through
the
crowd
of
unloving
he
is
stumbling
perhaps
his
heart
now
beats
fast
with
dread
now
heavily
with
anguish
his
eyes
are
sometimes
dim
with
tears
which
he
makes
haste
to
dash
away
he
pushes
manfully
on
with
fluctuating
faith
and
courage
with
a
sensitive
failing
body
at
last
he
falls
the
struggle
is
ended
and
the
crowd
closes
over
the
space
he
has
left
of
the
evangelical
clergy
a
disciple
of
venn
says
the
critic
from
his
station
a
remarkable
specimen
the
anatomy
and
habits
of
his
species
have
been
determined
long
ago
yet
surely
surely
the
only
true
knowledge
of
our
is
that
which
enables
us
to
feel
with
him
which
gives
us
a
fine
ear
for
the
that
are
beating
under
the
mere
clothes
of
circumstance
and
opinion
our
subtlest
analysis
of
schools
and
sects
must
miss
the
essential
truth
unless
it
be
lit
up
by
the
love
that
sees
in
all
forms
of
human
thought
and
work
the
life
and
death
struggles
of
separate

beings

with

on

imprudence

could
not
prevail
on
him
so
far
to
economize

or
other
which
his
friends
found
difficult

tryan
seemed
bent
on
wearing
himself
out
his
enemies
were
at
no
loss
to
account
for
such
a
course
the
evangelical
selfishness
was
clearly
of
too
bad
a
kind
to
exhibit
itself
after
the
ordinary
manner

a
severe
condemnation
on
this
and
expressed
his
fear
that
tryan
was
still
far
from
having
attained
true
christian
liberty
good
jerome
eagerly
seized
this
doctrinal
view
of
the
subject
as
a
means
of
enforcing
the
suggestions
of
his
own
benevolence
and
one
cloudy
afternoon
in
the
end
of
november
he
mounted
his
roan
mare
with
the
determination
of
riding
to
paddiford
and
the
point
with
tryan
the
old
gentleman
face
looked
very
mournful
as
he
rode
along
the
dismal
paddiford
lanes
between
rows
of
grimy
houses
darkened
with
while
the
black
dust
was
whirled
about
him
by
the
cold
november
wind
he
was
thinking
of
the
object
which
had
brought
him
on
this
afternoon
ride
and
his
thoughts
according
to
his
habit
when
alone
found
vent
every
now
and
then
in
audible
speech
it
seemed
to
him
as
his
eyes
rested
on
this
scene
of
tryan
labours
that
he
could
understand
the
without
resorting
to
stickney
theory
of
defective
spiritual
enlightenment
do
not
philosophic
doctors
tell
us
that
we
are
unable
to
discern
so
much
as
a
tree
except
by
an
unconscious
cunning
which
combines
many
past
and
separate
sensations
that
no
one
sense
is
independent
of
another
so
that
in
the
dark
we
can
hardly
taste
a
fricassee
or
tell
whether
our
pipe
is
alight
or
not
and
the
most
intelligent
boy
if
accommodated
with
claws
or
hoofs
instead
of
fingers
would
be
likely
to
remain
on
the
lowest
form
if
so
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
our
discernment
of
men
motives
must
depend
on
the
completeness
of
the
elements
we
can
bring
from
our
own
susceptibility
and
our
own
experience
see
to
it
friend
before
you
pronounce
a
too
hasty
judgement
that
your
own
moral
sensibilities
are
not
of
a
hoofed
or
clawed
character
the
keenest
eye
will
not
serve
unless
you
have
the
delicate
fingers
with
their
subtle
nerve
filaments
which
elude
scientific
lenses
and
lose
themselves
in
the
invisible
world
of
human
sensations
as
for
jerome
he
drew
the
elements
of
his
moral
vision
from
the
depths
of
his
veneration
and
pity
if
he
himself
felt
so
much
for
these
poor
things
to
whom
life
was
so
dim
and
meagre
what
must
the
clergyman
feel
who
had
undertaken
before
god
to
be
their
shepherd
he
whispered
interruptedly
too
big
a
load
for
his
conscience
poor
man
he
wants
to
mek
himself
their
brother

jerome
shook
his
bridle
violently
and
looked
up
with
an
air
of
moral
courage
as
if
stickney
had
been
present
and
liable
to
take
offence
at
this
conclusion
a
few
minutes
more
brought
him
in
front
of
wagstaff
where
tryan
lodged
he
had
often
been
here
before
so
that
the
contrast
between
this
ugly
square
brick
house
with
its
shabby
bit
of
stared
at
all
round
by
cottage
windows
and
his
own
pretty
white
home
set
in
a
paradise
of
orchard
and
garden
and
pasture
was
not
new
to
him
but
he
felt
it
with
fresh
force
today
as
he
slowly
fastened
his
roan
by
the
bridle
to
the
wooden
paling
and
knocked
at
the
door
tryan
was
at
home
and
sent
to
request
that
jerome
would
walk
up
into
his
study
as
the
fire
was
out
in
the
parlour
below
at
the
mention
of
a
clergyman
study
perhaps
your
too
active
imagination
conjures
up
a
perfect
snuggery
where
the
general
air
of
comfort
is
rescued
from
a
secular
character
by
strong
ecclesiastical
suggestions
in
the
shape
of
the
furniture
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
and
the
prints
on
the
wall
where
if
a
nap
is
taken
it
is
an
with
a
gothic
back
and
the
very
feet
rest
on
a
warm
and
velvety
simulation
of
church
windows
where
the
pure
art
of
rigorous
english
protestantism
smiles
above
the
mantelpiece
in
the
portrait
of
an
eminent
bishop
or
a
refined
anglican
taste
is
indicated
by
a
german
print
from
overbeck
where
the
walls
are
lined
with
choice
divinity
in
sombre
binding
and
the
light
is
softened
by
a
screen
of
boughs
with
a
grey
church
in
the
background
but
i
must
beg
you
to
dismiss
all
such
scenic
prettiness
suitable
as
they
may
be
to
a
clergyman
character
and
complexion
for
i
have
to
confess
that
tryan
study
was
a
very
ugly
little
room
indeed
with
an
ugly
slapdash
pattern
on
the
walls
an
ugly
carpet
on
the
floor
and
an
ugly
view
of
cottage
roofs
and
from
the
window
his
own
person
his
and
his
were
the
only
objects
in
the
room
that
had
the
slightest
air
of
refinement
and
the
sole
provision
for
comfort
was
a
clumsy
covered
with
faded
chintz
the
man
who
could
live
in
such
a
room
unconstrained
by
poverty
must
either
have
his
vision
fed
from
within
by
an
intense
passion
or
he
must
have
chosen
that
least
attractive
form
of
which
wears
no
haircloth
and
has
no
meagre
days
but
accepts
the
vulgar
the
commonplace
and
the
ugly
whenever
the
highest
duty
seems
to
lie
among
them
tryan
i
hope
you
excuse
me
disturbin
on
you
said
jerome
i
summat
partickler
to
say
do
disturb
me
at
all
jerome
i
very
glad
to
have
a
visit
from
you
said
tryan
shaking
him
heartily
by
the
hand
and
offering
him
the
chair
is
some
time
since
i
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
you
except
on
a
sunday
sir
your
time
so
taken
up
i
well
aware
o
that
it
not
only
what
you
hev
to
do
but
it
goin
about
from
place
to
place
an
you
do
keep
a
hoss
tryan
you
do
take
care
enough
o
yourself
you
do
indeed
an
that
what
i
come
to
talk
to
y
about
very
good
of
you
jerome
but
i
assure
you
i
think
walking
does
me
no
harm
it
is
rather
a
relief
to
me
after
speaking
or
writing
you
know
i
have
no
great
circuit
to
make
the
farthest
distance
i
have
to
walk
is
to
milby
church
and
if
ever
i
want
a
horse
on
a
sunday
i
hire
radley
who
lives
not
many
hundred
yards
from
me
but
now
the
winter
comin
on
an
you
get
wet
i
your
feet
an
pratt
tells
me
as
your
constitution
dillicate
as
anybody
may
see
for
the
matter
o
that
bein
a
doctor
an
this
is
the
light
i
look
at
it
in
tryan
who
to
fill
up
your
place
if
you
was
to
be
disabled
as
i
may
say
consider
what
a
valyable
life
yours
is
begun
a
great
work
i
milby
and
so
you
might
carry
it
on
if
you
your
health
and
strength
the
more
care
you
take
o
yourself
the
longer
you
live
belike
god
willing
to
do
good
to
your
my
dear
jerome
i
think
i
should
not
be
a
man
in
any
case
and
if
i
were
to
take
care
of
myself
under
the
pretext
of
doing
more
good
i
should
very
likely
die
and
leave
nothing
done
after
all
but
keepin
a
hoss
would
hinder
you
from
workin
it
help
you
to
do
more
though
pratt
says
as
it
usin
your
voice
so
constant
as
does
you
the
most
harm
now
is
it
i
no
scholard
tryan
i
not
to
dictate
to
you
but
is
it
yourself
to
go
on
a
that
way
beyond
your
strength
we
must
fling
ower
lives
away
not
fling
them
away
lightly
but
we
are
permitted
to
lay
down
our
lives
in
a
right
cause
there
are
many
duties
as
you
know
jerome
which
stand
before
taking
care
of
our
own
lives
i
ca
arguy
wi
you
tryan
but
what
i
wanted
to
this
there
my
little
chacenut
hoss
i
should
take
it
quite
a
kindness
if
you
hev
him
through
the
winter
an
ride
him
i
thought
o
him
a
many
times
for
jerome
ca
abide
him
and
what
do
i
want
two
nags
but
i
fond
o
the
little
chacenut
an
i
should
like
to
sell
him
so
if
you
only
ride
him
for
me
you
do
me
a
kindness
you
will
indeed
mr
tryan
you
jerome
i
promise
you
to
ask
for
him
when
i
feel
that
i
want
a
nag
there
is
no
man
i
would
more
gladly
be
indebted
to
than
you
but
at
present
i
would
rather
not
have
a
horse
i
should
ride
him
very
little
and
it
would
be
an
inconvenience
to
me
to
keep
him
rather
than
otherwise
jerome
looked
troubled
and
hesitating
as
if
he
had
something
on
his
mind
that
would
not
readily
shape
itself
into
words
at
last
he
said
excuse
me
tryan
i
would
be
takin
a
liberty
but
i
know
what
great
claims
you
hev
on
you
as
a
clergyman
is
it
th
expense
tryan
is
it
the
money
my
dear
sir
i
have
much
more
than
a
single
man
needs
my
way
of
living
is
quite
of
my
own
choosing
and
i
am
doing
nothing
but
what
i
feel
bound
to
do
quite
apart
from
money
considerations
we
can
not
judge
for
one
another
you
know
we
have
each
our
peculiar
weaknesses
and
temptations
i
quite
admit
that
it
might
be
right
for
another
man
to
allow
himself
more
luxuries
and
i
assure
you
i
think
it
no
superiority
in
myself
to
do
without
them
on
the
contrary
if
my
heart
were
less
rebellious
and
if
i
were
less
liable
to
temptation
i
should
not
need
that
sort
of
but
added
tryan
holding
out
his
hand
to
jerome
understand
your
kindness
and
bless
you
for
it
if
i
want
a
horse
i
shall
ask
for
the
chesnut
jerome
was
obliged
to
rest
contented
with
this
promise
and
rode
home
sorrowfully
reproaching
himself
with
not
having
said
one
thing
he
meant
to
say
when
setting
out
and
with
having
forgot
the
arguments
he
had
intended
to
quote
from
stickney
jerome
was
not
the
only
mind
that
was
seriously
disturbed
by
the
idea
that
the
curate
was
himself
there
were
tender
hearts
in
which
anxiety
about
the
state
of
his
affections
was
beginning
to
be
merged
in
anxiety
about
the
state
of
his
health
miss
eliza
pratt
had
at
one
time
passed
through
much
sleepless
cogitation
on
the
possibility
of
tryan
being
attached
to
some
lady
at
a
distance
at
laxeter
perhaps
where
he
had
formerly
held
a
curacy
and
her
fine
eyes
kept
close
watch
lest
any
symptom
of
engaged
affections
on
his
part
should
escape
her
it
seemed
an
alarming
fact
that
his
handkerchiefs
were
beautifully
marked
with
hair
until
she
reflected
that
he
had
an
unmarried
sister
of
whom
he
spoke
with
much
affection
as
his
companion
and
comforter
besides
tryan
had
never
paid
any
distant
visit
except
one
for
a
few
days
to
his
father
and
no
hint
escaped
him
of
his
intending
to
take
a
house
or
change
his
mode
of
living
no
he
could
not
be
engaged
though
he
might
have
been
disappointed
but
this
latter
misfortune
is
one
from
which
a
devoted
clergyman
has
been
known
to
recover
by
the
aid
of
a
fine
pair
of
grey
eyes
that
beam
on
him
with
affectionate
reverence
before
christmas
however
her
cogitations
began
to
take
another
turn
she
heard
her
father
say
very
confidently
that
was
consumptive
and
if
he
did
take
more
care
of
himself
his
life
would
not
be
worth
a
year
purchase
and
shame
at
having
speculated
on
suppositions
that
were
likely
to
prove
so
false
sent
poor
miss
eliza
feelings
with
all
the
stronger
impetus
into
the
one
channel
of
sorrowful
alarm
at
the
prospect
of
losing
the
pastor
who
had
opened
to
her
a
new
life
of
piety
and
it
is
a
sad
weakness
in
us
after
all
that
the
thought
of
a
man
death
hallows
him
anew
to
us
as
if
life
were
not
sacred
too
as
if
it
were
comparatively
a
light
thing
to
fail
in
love
and
reverence
to
the
brother
who
has
to
climb
the
whole
toilsome
steep
with
us
and
all
our
tears
and
tenderness
were
due
to
the
one
who
is
spared
that
hard
journey
the
miss
linnets
too
were
beginning
to
take
a
new
view
of
the
future
entirely
uncoloured
by
jealousy
of
miss
eliza
pratt
you
notice
said
mary
one
afternoon
when
pettifer
was
taking
tea
with
them
you
notice
that
short
dry
cough
of
yesterday
i
think
he
looks
worse
and
worse
every
week
and
i
only
wish
i
knew
his
sister
i
would
write
to
her
about
him
i
sure
something
should
be
done
to
make
him
give
up
part
of
his
work
and
he
will
listen
to
no
one
here
said
pettifer
a
thousand
pities
his
father
and
sister
ca
come
and
live
with
him
if
he
is
to
marry
but
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
he
could
have
taken
to
some
nice
woman
as
would
have
made
a
comfortable
home
for
him
i
used
to
think
he
might
take
to
eliza
pratt
she
a
good
girl
and
very
pretty
but
i
see
no
likelihood
of
it
now
indeed
said
rebecca
with
some
emphasis
tryan
heart
is
not
for
any
woman
to
win
it
is
all
given
to
his
work
and
i
could
never
wish
to
see
him
with
a
young
inexperienced
wife
who
would
be
a
drag
on
him
instead
of
a
need
have
somebody
young
or
old
observed
linnet
see
as
he
wears
a
flannel
wescoat
an
changes
his
stockins
when
he
comes
in
it
my
opinion
he
got
that
cough
wi
sittin
i
wet
shoes
and
stockins
an
that
wagstaff
a
poor
thing
she
does
half
tek
care
on
him
mother
said
rebecca
a
very
pious
woman
and
i
sure
she
thinks
it
too
great
a
privilege
to
have
tryan
with
her
not
to
do
the
best
she
can
to
make
him
comfortable
she
ca
help
her
rooms
being
shabby
nothing
to
say
again
her
piety
my
dear
but
i
know
very
well
i
should
like
her
to
cook
my
victual
when
a
man
comes
in
hungry
tired
piety
wo
feed
him
i
reckon
hard
carrots
lie
heavy
on
his
stomach
piety
or
no
piety
i
called
in
one
day
when
she
was
dishin
up
tryan
dinner
an
i
could
see
the
potatoes
was
as
watery
as
watery
it
right
enough
to
be
speritial
i
no
enemy
to
that
but
i
like
my
potatoes
mealy
i
do
see
as
anybody
go
to
heaven
the
sooner
for
not
digestin
their
dinner
providin
they
do
die
sooner
as
mayhap
tryan
will
poor
dear
man
will
be
a
heavy
day
for
us
all
when
that
comes
to
pass
said
pettifer
shall
never
get
anybody
to
fill
up
gap
there
the
new
clergyman
that
just
come
to
shepperton
parry
i
saw
him
the
other
day
at
mrs
bond
he
may
be
a
very
good
man
and
a
fine
preacher
they
say
he
is
but
i
thought
to
myself
what
a
difference
between
him
and
tryan
he
a
man
and
has
that
feeling
way
with
him
that
tryan
has
what
is
so
wonderful
to
me
in
tryan
is
the
way
he
puts
himself
on
a
level
with
one
and
talks
to
one
like
a
brother
i
never
afraid
of
telling
him
anything
he
never
seems
to
look
down
on
anybody
he
knows
how
to
lift
up
those
that
are
cast
down
if
ever
man
did
said
mary
when
i
see
all
the
faces
turned
up
to
him
in
paddiford
church
i
often
think
how
hard
it
would
be
for
any
clergyman
who
had
to
come
after
him
he
has
made
the
people
love
him
so
chapter
in
her
occasional
visits
to
her
near
neighbour
pettifer
too
old
a
friend
to
be
shunned
because
she
was
a
tryanite
janet
was
obliged
sometimes
to
hear
allusions
to
tryan
and
even
to
listen
to
his
praises
which
she
usually
met
with
playful
incredulity
well
she
answered
one
day
like
dear
old
crewe
and
his
pipes
a
great
deal
better
than
your
tryan
and
his
gospel
when
i
was
a
little
toddle
and
crewe
used
to
let
me
play
about
in
their
garden
and
have
a
swing
between
the
great
because
mother
had
no
garden
i
like
people
who
are
kind
kindness
is
my
religion
and
that
the
reason
i
like
you
dear
pettifer
though
you
are
a
tryanite
that
tryan
religion
too
at
least
partly
there
nobody
can
give
himself
up
more
to
doing
good
amongst
the
poor
and
he
thinks
of
their
bodies
too
as
well
as
their
souls
yes
yes
but
then
he
talks
about
faith
and
grace
and
all
that
making
people
believe
they
are
better
than
others
and
that
god
loves
them
more
than
he
does
the
rest
of
the
world
i
know
he
has
put
a
great
deal
of
that
into
sally
martin
head
and
it
has
done
her
no
good
at
all
she
was
as
nice
honest
patient
a
girl
as
need
be
before
and
now
she
fancies
she
has
new
light
and
new
wisdom
i
do
like
those
notions
mistake
him
indeed
you
do
my
dear
dempster
i
wish
you
go
and
hear
him
preach
him
preach
why
you
wicked
woman
you
would
persuade
me
to
disobey
my
husband
would
you
o
shocking
i
shall
run
away
from
you
a
few
days
after
this
conversation
however
janet
went
to
sally
about
three
in
the
afternoon
the
pudding
that
had
been
sent
in
for
herself
and
struck
her
as
just
the
sort
of
delicate
morsel
the
poor
consumptive
girl
would
be
likely
to
fancy
and
in
her
usual
impulsive
way
she
had
started
up
from
the
dinner
table
at
once
put
on
her
bonnet
and
set
off
with
a
covered
plateful
to
the
neighbouring
street
when
she
entered
the
house
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
but
in
the
little
sideroom
where
sally
lay
janet
heard
a
voice
it
was
one
she
had
not
heard
before
but
she
immediately
guessed
it
to
be
tryan
her
first
impulse
was
to
set
down
her
plate
and
go
away
but
martin
might
not
be
in
and
then
there
would
be
no
one
to
give
sally
that
delicious
bit
of
pudding
so
she
stood
still
and
was
obliged
to
hear
what
tryan
was
saying
he
was
interrupted
by
one
of
the
violent
fits
of
coughing
is
very
hard
to
bear
is
it
not
he
said
when
she
was
still
again
god
seems
to
support
you
under
it
wonderfully
pray
for
me
sally
that
i
may
have
strength
too
when
the
hour
of
great
suffering
comes
it
is
one
of
my
worst
weaknesses
to
shrink
from
bodily
pain
and
i
think
the
time
is
perhaps
not
far
off
when
i
shall
have
to
bear
what
you
are
bearing
but
now
i
have
tired
you
we
have
talked
enough
janet
was
surprised
and
forgot
her
wish
not
to
encounter
tryan
the
tone
and
the
words
were
so
unlike
what
she
had
expected
to
hear
there
was
none
of
the
unction
of
the
teacher
quoting
or
exhorting
or
expounding
for
the
benefit
of
the
hearer
but
a
simple
appeal
for
help
a
confession
of
weakness
tryan
had
his
troubles
then
tryan
too
like
herself
knew
what
it
was
to
tremble
at
a
foreseen
trial
to
shudder
at
an
impending
burthen
heavier
than
he
felt
able
to
bear
the
most
brilliant
deed
of
virtue
could
not
have
inclined
towards
tryan
so
much
as
this
fellowship
in
suffering
and
the
softening
thought
was
in
her
eyes
when
he
appeared
in
the
doorway
pale
weary
and
depressed
the
sight
of
janet
standing
there
with
the
entire
absence
of
which
belongs
to
a
new
and
vivid
impression
made
him
start
and
pause
a
little
their
eyes
met
and
they
looked
at
each
other
gravely
for
a
few
moments
then
they
bowed
and
tryan
passed
out
there
is
a
power
in
the
direct
glance
of
a
sincere
and
loving
human
soul
which
will
do
more
to
dissipate
prejudice
and
kindle
charity
than
the
most
elaborate
arguments
the
fullest
exposition
of
tryan
doctrine
might
not
have
sufficed
to
convince
janet
that
he
had
not
an
odious
in
believing
himself
a
peculiar
child
of
god
but
one
direct
pathetic
look
of
his
had
dissociated
him
with
that
conception
for
ever
this
happened
late
in
the
autumn
not
long
before
sally
martin
died
janet
mentioned
her
new
impression
to
no
one
for
she
was
afraid
of
arriving
at
a
still
more
complete
contradiction
of
her
former
ideas
we
have
all
of
us
considerable
regard
for
our
past
self
and
are
not
fond
of
casting
reflections
on
that
respected
individual
by
a
total
negation
of
his
opinions
janet
could
no
longer
think
of
tryan
without
sympathy
but
she
still
shrank
from
the
idea
of
becoming
his
hearer
and
admirer
that
was
a
reversal
of
the
past
which
was
as
little
accordant
with
her
inclination
as
her
circumstances
and
indeed
this
interview
with
tryan
was
soon
thrust
into
the
background
of
poor
janet
memory
by
the
daily
thickening
miseries
of
her
life
chapter
the
loss
of
jerome
as
a
client
proved
only
the
beginning
of
annoyances
to
dempster
that
old
gentleman
had
in
him
the
vigorous
remnant
of
an
energy
and
perseverance
which
had
created
his
own
fortune
and
being
as
i
have
hinted
given
to
chewing
the
cud
of
a
righteous
indignation
with
considerable
relish
he
was
determined
to
carry
on
his
retributive
war
against
the
persecuting
attorney
having
some
influence
with
pryme
who
was
one
of
the
most
substantial
in
the
neighbouring
parish
of
dingley
and
who
had
himself
a
complex
and
private
account
with
dempster
jerome
stirred
up
this
gentleman
to
an
investigation
of
some
suspicious
points
in
the
conduct
of
the
parish
affairs
the
natural
consequence
was
a
personal
quarrel
between
dempster
and
pryme
the
client
demanded
his
account
and
then
followed
the
old
story
of
an
exorbitant
lawyer
bill
with
the
unpleasant
of
taxing
these
disagreeables
extending
over
many
months
ran
along
side
by
side
with
the
pressing
business
of
armstrong
lawsuit
which
was
threatening
to
take
a
turn
rather
depreciatory
of
dempster
professional
prevision
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
being
thus
kept
in
a
constant
state
of
irritated
excitement
about
his
own
affairs
he
had
little
time
for
the
further
exhibition
of
his
public
spirit
or
for
rallying
the
forlorn
hope
of
sound
churchmanship
against
cant
and
hypocrisy
not
a
few
persons
who
had
a
grudge
against
him
began
to
remark
with
satisfaction
that
luck
was
forsaking
him
particularly
linnet
who
thought
she
saw
distinctly
the
gradual
ripening
of
a
providential
scheme
whereby
a
just
retribution
would
be
wrought
on
the
man
who
had
deprived
her
of
pye
croft
on
the
other
hand
dempster
clients
who
were
of
opinion
that
the
punishment
of
his
wickedness
might
conveniently
be
deferred
to
another
world
noticed
with
some
concern
that
he
was
drinking
more
than
ever
and
that
both
his
temper
and
his
driving
were
becoming
more
furious
unhappily
those
additional
glasses
of
brandy
that
exasperation
of
abuse
had
other
effects
than
any
that
entered
into
the
contemplation
of
anxious
clients
they
were
the
little
symbols
that
were
perpetually
raising
the
sum
of
home
misery
poor
janet
how
heavily
the
months
rolled
on
for
her
laden
with
fresh
sorrows
as
the
summer
passed
into
autumn
the
autumn
into
winter
and
the
winter
into
spring
again
every
feverish
morning
with
its
blank
listlessness
and
despair
seemed
more
hateful
than
the
last
every
coming
night
more
impossible
to
brave
without
arming
herself
in
leaden
stupor
the
morning
light
brought
no
gladness
to
her
it
seemed
only
to
throw
its
glare
on
what
had
happened
in
the
dim
on
the
cruel
man
seated
immovable
in
drunken
obstinacy
by
the
dead
fire
and
dying
lights
in
the
rating
her
in
harsh
tones
reiterating
old
reproaches
or
on
a
hideous
blank
of
something
unremembered
something
that
must
have
made
that
dark
bruise
on
her
shoulder
which
aches
as
she
dressed
herself
do
you
wonder
how
it
was
that
things
had
come
to
this
pass
what
offence
janet
had
committed
in
the
early
years
of
marriage
to
rouse
the
brutal
hatred
of
this
man
the
seeds
of
things
are
very
small
the
hours
that
lie
between
sunrise
and
the
gloom
of
midnight
are
travelled
through
by
tiniest
markings
of
the
clock
and
janet
looking
back
along
the
fifteen
years
of
her
married
life
hardly
knew
how
or
where
this
total
misery
began
hardly
knew
when
the
sweet
wedded
love
and
hope
that
had
set
for
ever
had
ceased
to
make
a
twilight
of
memory
and
relenting
before
the
of
the
utter
dark
old
dempster
thought
she
saw
the
true
beginning
of
it
all
in
want
of
housekeeping
skill
and
exactness
she
said
to
herself
always
running
about
doing
things
for
other
people
and
neglecting
her
own
house
that
provokes
a
man
what
use
is
it
for
a
woman
to
be
loving
and
making
a
fuss
with
her
husband
if
she
does
take
care
and
keep
his
home
just
as
he
likes
it
if
she
is
at
hand
when
he
wants
anything
done
if
she
does
attend
to
all
his
wishes
let
them
be
as
small
as
they
may
that
was
what
i
did
when
i
was
a
wife
though
i
make
half
so
much
fuss
about
loving
my
husband
then
janet
had
no
children
ah
there
mammy
dempster
had
touched
a
true
spring
not
perhaps
of
her
son
cruelty
but
of
half
janet
misery
if
she
had
had
babes
to
rock
to
sleep
little
ones
to
kneel
in
their
and
say
their
prayers
at
her
knees
sweet
boys
and
girls
to
put
their
young
arms
round
her
neck
and
kiss
away
her
tears
her
poor
hungry
heart
would
have
been
fed
with

never

that
fiery
poison

still
its
cravings
mighty
is
the
force
of
motherhood
says
the
great
tragic
poet
to
us
across
the
ages
finding
as
usual
the
simplest
words
for
the
sublimest
fact
greek
deinon
to
tiktein
estin
it
transforms
all
things
by
its
vital
heat
it
turns
timidity
into
fierce
courage
and
dreadless
defiance
into
tremulous
submission
it
turns
thoughtlessness
into
foresight
and
yet
stills
all
anxiety
into
calm
content
it
makes
selfishness
become

gives
even
to
hard
vanity
the
glance
of
admiring
love
yes
if
janet
had
been
a
mother
she
might
have
been
saved
from
much
sin
and
therefore
from
much
of
her
sorrow
but
do
not
believe
that
it
was
anything
either
present
or
wanting
in
poor
janet
that
formed
the
motive
of
her
husband
cruelty
cruelty
like
every
other
vice
requires
no
motive
outside
itself
it
only
requires
opportunity
you
do
not
suppose
dempster
had
any
motive
for
drinking
beyond
the
craving
for
drink
the
presence
of
brandy
was
the
only
necessary
condition
and
an
unloving
tyrannous
brutal
man
needs
no
motive
to
prompt
his
cruelty
he
needs
only
the
perpetual
presence
of
a
woman
he
can
call
his
own
a
whole
park
full
of
tame
or
animals
to
torment
at
his
will
would
not
serve
him
so
well
to
glut
his
lust
of
torture
they
could
not
feel
as
one
woman
does
they
could
not
throw
out
the
keen
retort
which
whets
the
edge
of
hatred
janet
bitterness
would
overflow
in
ready
words
she
was
not
to
be
made
meek
by
cruelty
she
would
repent
of
nothing
in
the
face
of
injustice
though
she
was
subdued
in
a
moment
by
a
word
or
a
look
that
recalled
the
old
days
of
fondness
and
in
times
of
comparative
calm
would
often
recover
her
sweet
woman
habit
of
caressing
playful
affection
but
such
days
were
become
rare
and
poor
janet
soul
was
kept
like
a
vexed
sea
tossed
by
a
new
storm
before
the
old
waves
have
fallen
proud
angry
resistance
and
sullen
endurance
were
now
almost
the
only
alternations
she
knew
she
would
bear
it
all
proudly
to
the
world
but
proudly
towards
him
too
her
woman
weakness
might
shriek
a
cry
for
pity
under
a
heavy
blow
but
voluntarily
she
would
do
nothing
to
mollify
him
unless
he
first
relented
what
had
she
ever
done
to
him
but
love
him
too
well
but
believe
in
him
too
foolishly
he
had
no
pity
on
her
tender
flesh
he
could
strike
the
soft
neck
he
had
once
asked
to
kiss
yet
she
would
not
admit
her
wretchedness
she
had
married
him
blindly
and
she
would
bear
it
out
to
the
terrible
end
whatever
that
might
be
better
this
misery
than
the
blank
that
lay
for
her
outside
her
married
home
but
there
was
one
person
who
heard
all
the
plaints
and
all
the
outbursts
of
bitterness
and
despair
which
janet
was
never
tempted
to
pour
into
any
other
ear
and
alas
in
her
worst
moments
janet
would
throw
out
wild
reproaches
against
that
patient
listener
for
the
wrong
that
rouses
our
angry
passions
finds
only
a
medium
in
us
it
passes
through
us
like
a
vibration
and
we
inflict
what
we
have
suffered
raynor
saw
too
clearly
all
through
the
winter
that
things
were
getting
worse
in
orchard
street
she
had
evidence
enough
of
it
in
visits
to
her
and
though
her
own
visits
to
her
daughter
were
so
timed
that
she
saw
little
of
dempster
personally
she
noticed
many
indications
not
only
that
he
was
drinking
to
greater
excess
but
that
he
was
beginning
to
lose
that
physical
power
of
supporting
excess
which
had
long
been
the
admiration
of
such
fine
spirits
as
tomlinson
it
seemed
as
if
dempster
had
some
consciousness
of
this
some
new
distrust
of
himself
for
before
winter
was
over
it
was
observed
that
he
had
renounced
his
habit
of
driving
out
alone
and
was
never
seen
in
his
gig
without
a
servant
by
his
side
nemesis
is
lame
but
she
is
of
colossal
stature
like
the
gods
and
sometimes
while
her
sword
is
not
yet
unsheathed
she
stretches
out
her
huge
left
arm
and
grasps
her
victim
the
mighty
hand
is
invisible
but
the
victim
totters
under
the
dire
clutch
the
various
symptoms
that
things
were
getting
worse
with
the
dempsters
afforded
milby
gossip
something
new
to
say
on
an
old
subject
dempster
every
one
remarked
looked
more
miserable
than
ever
though
she
kept
up
the
old
pretence
of
being
happy
and
satisfied
she
was
scarcely
ever
seen
as
she
used
to
be
going
about
on
her
errands
and
even
old
crewe
who
had
always
been
wilfully
blind
to
anything
wrong
in
her
favourite
janet
was
obliged
to
admit
that
she
had
not
seemed
like
herself
lately
poor
thing
out
of
health
said
the
kind
little
old
lady
in
answer
to
all
gossip
about
janet
headaches
always
were
bad
and
i
know
what
headaches
are
why
they
make
one
quite
delirious
sometimes
phipps
for
her
part
declared
she
would
never
accept
an
invitation
to
dempster
again
it
was
getting
so
very
disagreeable
to
go
there
dempster
was
often
strange
to
be
sure
there
were
dreadful
stories
about
the
way
dempster
used
his
wife
but
in
phipps
opinion
it
was
six
of
one
and
of
the
other
dempster
had
never
been
like
other
women
she
had
always
a
flighty
way
with
her
carrying
parcels
of
snuff
to
old
tooke
and
going
to
drink
tea
with
brinley
the
carpenter
wife
and
then
never
taking
care
of
her
clothes
always
wearing
the
same
things
or
sunday
a
man
has
a
poor
with
a
wife
of
that
sort
phipps
amiable
and
laconic
wondered
how
it
was
women
were
so
fond
of
running
each
other
down
pratt
having
been
called
in
provisionally
to
a
patient
of
pilgrim
in
a
case
of
compound
fracture
observed
in
a
friendly
colloquy
with
his
brother
surgeon
the
next
day
dempster
has
left
off
driving
himself
i
see
he
wo
end
with
a
broken
neck
after
all
you
have
a
case
of
meningitis
and
delirium
tremens
instead
said
pilgrim
can
hardly
stand
it
much
longer
at
the
rate
he
going
on
one
would
think
he
been
confoundedly
cut
up
about
that
business
of
armstrong
i
fancy
it
may
do
him
some
harm
perhaps
but
dempster
must
have
feathered
his
nest
pretty
well
he
can
afford
to
lose
a
little
business
business
will
outlast
him
that
pretty
clear

down
like
a
watch
with
a
broken
spring
one
of
these
days
another
prognostic
of
evil
to
dempster
came
at
the
beginning
of
march
for
then
little
died
died
suddenly
the
housemaid
found
her
seated
motionless
in
her
her
knitting
fallen
down
and
the
cat
reposing
on
it
unreproved
the
little
white
old
woman
had
ended
her
wintry
age
of
patient
sorrow
believing
to
the
last
that
might
have
been
a
good
husband
as
he
had
been
a
good
son
when
the
earth
was
thrown
on
mamsey
coffin
and
the
son
in
crape
scarf
and
hatband
turned
away
homeward
his
good
angel
lingering
with
outstretched
wing
on
the
edge
of
the
grave
cast
one
despairing
look
after
him
and
took
flight
for
ever
chapter
the
last
week
in
march
three
weeks
after
old
dempster
died
occurred
the
unpleasant
of
affairs
between
dempster
and
pryme
and
under
this
additional
source
of
irritation
the
diurnal
drunkenness
had
taken
on
its
most
and
brutal
phase
on
the
friday
morning
before
setting
out
for
rotherby
he
told
his
wife
that
he
had
invited
men
to
dinner
at
six
that
evening
the
previous
night
had
been
a
terrible
one
for
janet
and
when
her
husband
broke
his
grim
morning
silence
to
say
these
few
words
she
was
looking
so
blank
and
listless
that
he
added
in
a
loud
sharp
key
you
hear
what
i
say
or
must
i
tell
the
cook
she
started
and
said
i
hear
mind
and
have
a
dinner
provided
and
do
go
mooning
about
like
crazy
jane
half
an
hour
afterwards
raynor
quietly
busy
in
her
kitchen
with
her
household
labours
for
she
had
only
a
little
girl
as
a
servant
heard
with
trembling
the
rattling
of
the
garden
gate
and
the
opening
of
the
outer
door
she
knew
the
step
and
in
one
short
moment
she
lived
beforehand
through
the
coming
scene
she
hurried
out
of
the
kitchen
and
there
in
the
passage
as
she
had
felt
stood
janet
her
eyes
worn
as
if
by
watching
her
dress
careless
her
step
languid
no
cheerful
morning
greeting
to
her
mother
no
kiss
she
turned
into
the
parlour
and
seating
herself
on
the
sofa
opposite
her
mother
chair
looked
vacantly
at
the
walls
and
furniture
until
the
corners
of
her
mouth
began
to
tremble
and
her
dark
eyes
filled
with
tears
that
fell
unwiped
down
her
cheeks
the
mother
sat
silently
opposite
to
her
afraid
to
speak
she
felt
sure
there
was
nothing
new
the
matter
sure
that
the
torrent
of
words
would
come
sooner
or
later
why
do
you
speak
to
me
janet
burst
out
at
last
care
about
my
suffering
you
are
blaming
me
because
i
feel
because
i
am
miserable
child
i
am
not
blaming
you
my
heart
is
bleeding
for
you
your
head
is
bad
this
morning
you
have
had
a
bad
night
let
me
make
you
a
cup
of
tea
now
perhaps
you
did
like
your
breakfast
that
is
what
you
always
think
mother
it
is
the
old
story
you
think
you
do
ask
me
what
it
is
i
have
had
to
bear
you
are
tired
of
hearing
me
you
are
cruel
like
the
rest
every
one
is
cruel
in
this
world
nothing
but
blame
blame
blame
never
any
pity
god
is
cruel
to
have
sent
me
into
the
world
to
bear
all
this
misery
janet
do
say
so
it
is
not
for
us
to
judge
we
must
submit
we
must
be
thankful
for
the
gift
of
life
for
life
why
should
i
be
thankful
god
has
made
me
with
a
heart
to
feel
and
he
has
sent
me
nothing
but
misery
how
could
i
help
it
how
could
i
know
what
would
come
why
did
you
tell
me
mother
why
did
you
let
me
marry
you
knew
what
brutes
men
could
be
and
there
no
help
for
me
no
hope
i
ca
kill
myself
i
tried
but
i
ca
leave
this
world
and
go
to
another
there
may
be
no
pity
for
me
there
as
there
is
none
here
my
child
there
pity
have
i
ever
done
anything
but
love
you
and
there
is
pity
in
god
has
he
put
pity
into
your
heart
for
many
a
poor
sufferer
where
did
it
come
from
if
not
from
him
janet
nervous
irritation
now
broke
out
into
sobs
instead
of
complainings
and
her
mother
was
thankful
for
after
that
crisis
there
would
very
likely
come
relenting
and
tenderness
and
comparative
calm
she
went
out
to
make
some
tea
and
when
she
returned
with
the
tray
in
her
hands
janet
had
dried
her
eyes
and
now
turned
them
towards
her
mother
with
a
faint
attempt
to
smile
but
the
poor
face
in
its
sad
blurred
beauty
looked
all
the
more
piteous
will
insist
upon
her
tea
she
said
i
really
think
i
can
drink
a
cup
but
i
must
go
home
directly
for
there
are
people
coming
to
dinner
could
you
go
with
me
and
help
me
mother
raynor
was
always
ready
to
do
that
she
went
to
orchard
street
with
janet
and
remained
with
her
through
the
day
comforted
as
evening
approached
to
see
her
become
more
cheerful
and
willing
to
attend
to
her
toilette
at
five
everything
was
in
order
janet
was
dressed
and
when
the
mother
had
kissed
her
and
said
she
could
not
help
pausing
a
moment
in
sorrowful
admiration
at
the
tall
rich
figure
looking
all
the
grander
for
the
plainness
of
the
deep
mourning
dress
and
the
noble
face
with
its
massy
folds
of
black
hair
made
matronly
by
a
simple
white
cap
janet
had
that
enduring
beauty
which
belongs
to
pure
majestic
outline
and
depth
of
tint
sorrow
and
neglect
leave
their
traces
on
such
beauty
but
it
thrills
us
to
the
last
like
a
glorious
greek
temple
which
for
all
the
loss
it
has
suffered
from
time
and
barbarous
hands
has
gained
a
solemn
history
and
fills
our
imagination
the
more
because
it
is
incomplete
to
the
sense
it
was
six
before
dempster
returned
from
rotherby
he
had
evidently
drunk
a
great
deal
and
was
in
an
angry
humour
but
janet
who
had
gathered
some
little
courage
and
forbearance
from
the
consciousness
that
she
had
done
her
best
was
determined
to
speak
pleasantly
to
him
she
said
gently
as
she
saw
him
seat
himself
in
the
in
his
dusty
snuffy
clothes
and
take
some
documents
out
of
his
pocket
you
not
wash
and
change
your
dress
it
will
refresh
you
me
alone
will
you
said
dempster
in
his
most
brutal
tone
change
your
coat
and
waistcoat
they
are
so
dusty
i
laid
all
your
things
out
ready
you
have
have
you
after
a
few
minutes
he
rose
very
deliberately
and
walked
upstairs
into
his
bedroom
janet
had
often
been
scolded
before
for
not
laying
out
his
clothes
and
she
thought
now
not
without
some
wonder
that
this
attention
of
hers
had
brought
him
to
compliance
presently
he
called
out
and
she
went
upstairs
take
that
he
said
as
soon
as
she
reached
the
door
flinging
at
her
the
coat
she
had
laid
out
time
leave
me
to
do
as
i
please
will
you
the
coat
flung
with
great
force
only
brushed
her
shoulder
and
fell
some
distance
within
the
the
door
of
which
stood
open
just
opposite
she
hastily
retreated
as
she
saw
the
waistcoat
coming
and
one
by
one
the
clothes
she
had
laid
out
were
all
flung
into
the
janet
face
flushed
with
anger
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
her
resentment
overcame
the
long
cherished
pride
that
made
her
hide
her
griefs
from
the
world
there
are
moments
when
by
some
strange
impulse
we
contradict
our
past
selves
fatal
moments
when
a
fit
of
passion
like
a
lava
stream
lays
low
the
work
of
half
our
lives
janet
thought
will
not
pick
up
the
clothes
they
shall
lie
there
until
the
visitors
come
and
he
shall
be
ashamed
of
himself
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
she
made
haste
to
seat
herself
in
the
lest
the
servant
should
enter
and
remove
the
clothes
which
were
lying
half
on
the
table
and
half
on
the
ground
lowme
entered
with
a
less
familiar
visitor
a
client
of
dempster
and
the
next
moment
dempster
himself
came
in
his
eye
fell
at
once
on
the
clothes
and
then
turned
for
an
instant
with
a
devilish
glance
of
concentrated
hatred
on
janet
who
still
flushed
and
excited
affected
unconsciousness
after
shaking
hands
with
his
visitors
he
immediately
rang
the
bell
those
clothes
away
he
said
to
the
servant
not
looking
at
janet
again
during
dinner
she
kept
up
her
assumed
air
of
indifference
and
tried
to
seem
in
high
spirits
laughing
and
talking
more
than
usual
in
reality
she
felt
as
if
she
had
defied
a
wild
beast
within
the
four
walls
of
his
den
and
he
was
crouching
backward
in
preparation
for
his
deadly
spring
dempster
affected
to
take
no
notice
of
her
talked
obstreperously
and
drank
steadily
about
eleven
the
party
dispersed
with
the
exception
of
budd
who
had
joined
them
after
dinner
and
appeared
disposed
to
stay
drinking
a
little
longer
janet
began
to
hope
that
he
would
stay
long
enough
for
dempster
to
become
heavy
and
stupid
and
so
to
fall
asleep
which
was
a
rare
but
occasional
ending
of
his
nights
she
told
the
servants
to
sit
up
no
longer
and
she
herself
undressed
and
went
to
bed
trying
to
cheat
her
imagination
into
the
belief
that
the
day
was
ended
for
her
but
when
she
lay
down
she
became
more
intensely
awake
than
ever
everything
she
had
taken
this
evening
seemed
only
to
stimulate
her
senses
and
her
apprehensions
to
new
vividness
her
heart
beat
violently
and
she
heard
every
sound
in
the
house
at
last
when
it
was
twelve
she
heard
budd
go
out
she
heard
the
door
slam
dempster
had
not
moved
was
he
asleep
would
he
forget
the
minute
seemed
long
while
with
a
quickening
pulse
she
was
on
the
stretch
to
catch
every
sound
the
loud
jarring
voice
seemed
to
strike
her
like
a
hurled
weapon
he
called
again
moving
out
of
the
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
there
was
a
pause
of
a
minute
you
do
come
i
kill
you
another
pause
and
she
heard
him
turn
back
into
the
he
was
gone
for
a
light
perhaps
for
a
weapon
perhaps
he
kill
her
let
him
life
was
as
hideous
as
death
for
years
she
had
been
rushing
on
to
some
unknown
but
certain
horror
and
now
she
was
close
upon
it
she
was
almost
glad
she
was
in
a
state
of
flushed
feverish
defiance
that
neutralized
her
woman
terrors
she
heard
his
heavy
step
on
the
stairs
she
saw
the
slowly
advancing
light
then
she
saw
the
tall
massive
figure
and
the
heavy
face
now
fierce
with
drunken
rage
he
had
nothing
but
the
candle
in
his
hand
he
set
it
down
on
the
table
and
advanced
close
to
the
bed
you
think
you
defy
me
do
you
we
see
how
long
that
will
last
get
up
madam
out
of
bed
this
instant
in
the
close
presence
of
the
dreadful
man
of
this
huge
crushing
force
armed
with
savage
will
poor
janet
desperate
defiance
all
forsook
her
and
her
terrors
came
back
trembling
she
got
up
and
stood
helpless
in
her
before
her
husband
he
seized
her
with
his
heavy
grasp
by
the
shoulder
and
pushed
her
before
him
cool
your
hot
spirit
for
you
i
teach
you
to
brave
me
slowly
he
pushed
her
along
before
him
down
stairs
and
through
the
passage
where
a
small
was
still
flickering
what
was
he
going
to
do
to
her
she
thought
every
moment
he
was
going
to
dash
her
before
him
on
the
ground
but
she
gave
no
scream
she
only
trembled
he
pushed
her
on
to
the
entrance
and
held
her
firmly
in
his
grasp
while
he
lifted
the
latch
of
the
door
then
he
opened
the
door
a
little
way
thrust
her
out
and
slammed
it
behind
her
for
a
short
space
it
seemed
like
a
deliverance
to
janet
the
harsh
wind
that
blew
through
her
thin
and
sent
her
long
heavy
black
hair
streaming
seemed
like
the
breath
of
pity
after
the
grasp
of
that
threatening
monster
but
soon
the
sense
of
release
from
an
overpowering
terror
gave
way
before
the
sense
of
the
fate
that
had
really
come
upon
her
this
then
was
what
she
had
been
travelling
towards
through
her
long
years
of
misery
not
yet
death
o
if
she
had
been
brave
enough
for
it
death
would
have
been
better
the
servants
slept
at
the
back
of
the
house
it
was
impossible
to
make
them
hear
so
that
they
might
let
her
in
again
quietly
without
her
husband
knowledge
and
she
would
not
have
tried
he
had
thrust
her
out
and
it
should
be
for
ever
there
would
have
been
dead
silence
in
orchard
street
but
for
the
whistling
of
the
wind
and
the
swirling
of
the
march
dust
on
the
pavement
thick
clouds
covered
the
sky
every
door
was
closed
every
window
was
dark
no
ray
of
light
fell
on
the
tall
white
figure
that
stood
in
lonely
misery
on
the
doorstep
no
eye
rested
on
janet
as
she
sank
down
on
the
cold
stone
and
looked
into
the
dismal
night
she
seemed
to
be
looking
into
her
own
blank
future
chapter
the
stony
street
the
bitter
wind
and
darkness
and
in
the
midst
of
them
a
tender
woman
thrust
out
from
her
husband
home
in
her
thin
the
harsh
wind
cutting
her
naked
feet
and
driving
her
long
hair
away
from
her
bosom
where
the
poor
heart
is
crushed
with
anguish
and
despair
the
drowning
man
urged
by
the
supreme
agony
lives
in
an
instant
through
all
his
happy
and
unhappy
past
when
the
dark
flood
has
fallen
like
a
curtain
memory
in
a
single
moment
sees
the
drama
acted
over
again
and
even
in
those
earlier
crises
which
are
but
types
of
death
when
we
are
cut
off
abruptly
from
the
life
we
have
known
when
we
can
no
longer
expect
tomorrow
to
resemble
yesterday
and
find
ourselves
by
some
sudden
shock
on
the
confines
of
the
unknown
there
is
often
the
same
sort
of
through
the
dark
and
unfrequented
chambers
of
memory
when
janet
sat
down
shivering
on
the
with
the
door
shut
upon
her
past
life
and
the
future
black
and
unshapen
before
her
as
the
night
the
scenes
of
her
childhood
her
youth
and
her
painful
womanhood
rushed
back
upon
her
consciousness
and
made
one
picture
with
her
present
desolation
the
petted
child
taking
her
newest
toy
to
bed
with
her
the
young
girl
proud
in
strength
and
beauty
dreaming
that
life
was
an
easy
thing
and
that
it
was
pitiful
weakness
to
be
unhappy
the
bride
passing
with
trembling
joy
from
the
outer
court
to
the
inner
sanctuary
of
life
the
wife
beginning
her
initiation
into
sorrow
wounded
resenting
yet
still
hoping
and
forgiving
the
poor
bruised
woman
seeking
through
weary
years
the
one
refuge
of
despair
oblivion
janet
seemed
to
herself
all
these
in
the
same
moment
that
she
was
conscious
of
being
seated
on
the
cold
stone
under
the
shock
of
a
new
misery
all
her
early
gladness
all
her
bright
hopes
and
illusions
all
her
gifts
of
beauty
and
affection
served
only
to
darken
the
riddle
of
her
life
they
were
the
betraying
promises
of
a
cruel
destiny
which
had
brought
out
those
sweet
blossoms
only
that
the
winds
and
storms
might
have
a
greater
work
of
desolation
which
had
nursed
her
like
a
pet
fawn
into
tenderness
and
fond
expectation
only
that
she
might
feel
a
keener
terror
in
the
clutch
of
the
panther
her
mother
had
sometimes
said
that
troubles
were
sent
to
make
us
better
and
draw
us
nearer
to
god
what
mockery
that
seemed
to
janet
troubles
had
been
sinking
her
lower
from
year
to
year
pressing
upon
her
like
heavy
vapours
and
perverting
the
very
plenitude
of
her
nature
into
a
deeper
source
of
disease
her
wretchedness
had
been
a
perpetually
tightening
instrument
of
torture
which
had
gradually
absorbed
all
the
other
sensibilities
of
her
nature
into
the
sense
of
pain
and
the
maddened
craving
for
relief
oh
if
some
ray
of
hope
of
pity
of
consolation
would
pierce
through
the
horrible
gloom
she
might
believe
in
a
divine
love
in
a
heavenly
father
who
cared
for
his
children
but
now
she
had
no
faith
no
trust
there
was
nothing
she
could
lean
on
in
the
wide
world
for
her
mother
was
only
a
in
her
own
lot
the
poor
patient
woman
could
do
little
more
than
mourn
with
her
daughter
she
had
humble
resignation
enough
to
sustain
her
own
soul
but
she
could
no
more
give
comfort
and
fortitude
to
janet
than
the
withered
trunk
can
bear
up
its
strong
offspring
crashing
down
under
an
alpine
storm
janet
felt
she
was
alone
no
human
soul
had
measured
her
anguish
had
understood
her
had
entered
into
her
sorrows
and
her
sins
with
that
sympathy
which
is
wiser
than
all
blame
more
potent
than
all
reproof
such
sympathy
as
had
swelled
her
own
heart
for
many
a
sufferer
and
if
there
was
any
divine
pity
she
could
not
feel
it
it
kept
aloof
from
her
it
poured
no
balm
into
her
wounds
it
stretched
out
no
hand
to
bear
up
her
weak
resolve
to
fortify
her
fainting
courage
now
in
her
utmost
loneliness
she
shed
no
tear
she
sat
staring
fixedly
into
the
darkness
while
inwardly
she
gazed
at
her
own
past
almost
losing
the
sense
that
it
was
her
own
or
that
she
was
anything
more
than
a
spectator
at
a
strange
and
dreadful
play
the
loud
sound
of
the
church
clock
striking
one
startled
her
she
had
not
been
there
more
than
half
an
hour
then
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
had
been
there
half
the
night
she
was
getting
benumbed
with
cold
with
that
strong
instinctive
dread
of
pain
and
death
which
had
made
her
recoil
from
suicide
she
started
up
and
the
disagreeable
sensation
of
resting
on
her
benumbed
feet
helped
to
recall
her
completely
to
the
sense
of
the
present
the
wind
was
beginning
to
make
rents
in
the
clouds
and
there
came
every
now
and
then
a
dim
light
of
stars
that
frightened
her
more
than
the
darkness
it
was
like
a
cruel
finger
pointing
her
out
in
her
wretchedness
and
humiliation
it
made
her
shudder
at
the
thought
of
the
morning
twilight
what
could
she
do
not
go
to
her
mother
not
rouse
her
in
the
dead
of
night
to
tell
her
this
her
mother
would
think
she
was
a
spectre
it
would
be
enough
to
kill
her
with
horror
and
the
way
there
was
so
long
if
she
should
meet
some
one
yet
she
must
seek
some
shelter
somewhere
to
hide
herself
five
doors
off
there
was
pettifer
that
kind
woman
would
take
her
in
it
was
of
no
use
now
to
be
proud
and
mind
about
the
world
knowing
she
had
nothing
to
wish
for
nothing
to
care
about
only
she
could
not
help
shuddering
at
the
thought
of
braving
the
morning
light
there
in
the
street
she
was
frightened
at
the
thought
of
spending
long
hours
in
the
cold
life
might
mean
anguish
might
mean
despair
but
oh
she
must
clutch
it
though
with
bleeding
fingers
her
feet
must
cling
to
the
firm
earth
that
the
sunlight
would
revisit
not
slip
into
the
untried
abyss
where
she
might
long
even
for
familiar
pains
janet
trod
slowly
with
her
naked
feet
on
the
rough
pavement
trembling
at
the
fitful
gleams
of
starlight
and
supporting
herself
by
the
wall
as
the
gusts
of
wind
drove
right
against
her
the
very
wind
was
cruel
it
tried
to
push
her
back
from
the
door
where
she
wanted
to
go
and
knock
and
ask
for
pity
pettifer
house
did
not
look
into
orchard
street
it
stood
a
little
way
up
a
wide
passage
which
opened
into
the
street
through
an
archway
janet
turned
up
the
archway
and
saw
a
faint
light
coming
from
pettifer
bedroom
window
the
glimmer
of
a
rushlight
from
a
room
where
a
friend
was
lying
was
like
a
ray
of
mercy
to
janet
after
that
long
long
time
of
darkness
and
loneliness
it
would
not
be
so
dreadful
to
awake
pettifer
as
she
had
thought
yet
she
lingered
some
minutes
at
the
door
before
she
gathered
courage
to
knock
she
felt
as
if
the
sound
must
betray
her
to
others
besides
pettifer
though
there
was
no
other
dwelling
that
opened
into
the
passage
only
warehouses
and
outbuildings
there
was
no
gravel
for
her
to
throw
up
at
the
window
nothing
but
heavy
pavement
there
was
no
she
must
knock
her
first
rap
was
very
timid
one
feeble
fall
of
the
knocker
and
then
she
stood
still
again
for
many
minutes
but
presently
she
rallied
her
courage
and
knocked
several
times
together
not
loudly
but
rapidly
so
that
pettifer
if
she
only
heard
the
sound
could
not
mistake
it
and
she
heard
it
for
by
and
by
the
casement
of
her
window
was
opened
and
janet
perceived
that
she
was
bending
out
to
try
and
discern
who
it
was
at
the
door
is
i
pettifer
it
is
janet
dempster
take
me
in
for
sake
god
what
has
happened
has
turned
me
out
i
have
been
in
the
cold
a
long
while
pettifer
said
no
more
but
hurried
away
from
the
window
and
was
soon
at
the
door
with
a
light
in
her
hand
in
my
poor
dear
come
in
said
the
good
woman
in
a
tremulous
voice
drawing
janet
within
the
door
into
my
warm
bed
and
may
god
in
heaven
save
and
comfort
you
the
pitying
eyes
the
tender
voice
the
warm
touch
caused
a
rush
of
new
feeling
in
janet
her
heart
swelled
and
she
burst
out
suddenly
like
a
child
into
loud
passionate
sobs
pettifer
could
not
help
crying
with
her
but
she
said
upstairs
my
dear
come
do
linger
in
the
cold
she
drew
the
poor
sobbing
thing
gently
and
persuaded
her
to
get
into
the
warm
bed
but
it
was
long
before
janet
could
lie
down
she
sat
leaning
her
head
on
her
knees
convulsed
by
sobs
while
the
motherly
woman
covered
her
with
clothes
and
held
her
arms
round
her
to
comfort
her
with
warmth
at
last
the
hysterical
passion
had
exhausted
itself
and
she
fell
back
on
the
pillow
but
her
throat
was
still
agitated
by
piteous
such
as
shake
a
little
child
even
when
it
has
found
a
refuge
from
its
alarms
on
its
mother
lap
now
janet
was
getting
quieter
pettifer
determined
to
go
down
and
make
a
cup
of
tea
the
first
thing
a
kind
old
woman
thinks
of
as
a
solace
and
restorative
under
all
calamities
happily
there
was
no
danger
of
awaking
her
servant
a
heavy
girl
of
sixteen
who
was
snoring
blissfully
in
the
attic
and
might
be
kept
ignorant
of
the
way
in
which
dempster
had
come
in
so
pettifer
busied
herself
with
rousing
the
kitchen
fire
which
was
kept
in
under
a
huge
a
possibility
by
which
the
coal
of
the
midland
counties
atones
for
all
its
slowness
and
white
ashes
when
she
carried
up
the
tea
janet
was
lying
quite
still
the
spasmodic
agitation
had
ceased
and
she
seemed
lost
in
thought
her
eyes
were
fixed
vacantly
on
the
rushlight
shade
and
all
the
lines
of
sorrow
were
deepened
in
her
face
my
dear
said
pettifer
me
persuade
you
to
drink
a
cup
of
tea
you
find
it
warm
you
and
soothe
you
very
much
why
dear
heart
your
feet
are
like
ice
still
now
do
drink
this
tea
and
wrap
up
in
flannel
and
then
they
get
warm
janet
turned
her
dark
eyes
on
her
old
friend
and
stretched
out
her
arms
she
was
too
much
oppressed
to
say
anything
her
suffering
lay
like
a
heavy
weight
on
her
power
of
speech
but
she
wanted
to
kiss
the
good
kind
woman
pettifer
setting
down
the
cup
bent
towards
the
sad
beautiful
face
and
janet
kissed
her
with
earnest
sacramental
kisses
such
kisses
as
seal
a
new
and
closer
bond
between
the
helper
and
the
helped
she
drank
the
tea
obediently
warm
me
she
said
now
you
will
get
into
bed
i
shall
lie
still
now
pettifer
felt
it
was
the
best
thing
she
could
do
to
lie
down
quietly
and
say
no
more
she
hoped
janet
might
go
to
sleep
as
for
herself
with
that
tendency
to
wakefulness
common
to
advanced
years
she
found
it
impossible
to
compose
herself
to
sleep
again
after
this
agitating
surprise
she
lay
listening
to
the
clock
wondering
what
had
led
to
this
new
outrage
of
dempster
praying
for
the
poor
thing
at
her
side
and
pitying
the
mother
who
would
have
to
hear
it
all
tomorrow
chapter
janet
lay
still
as
she
had
promised
but
the
tea
which
had
warmed
her
and
given
her
a
sense
of
greater
bodily
ease
had
only
heightened
the
previous
excitement
of
her
brain
her
ideas
had
a
new
vividness
which
made
her
feel
as
if
she
had
only
seen
life
through
a
dim
haze
before
her
thoughts
instead
of
springing
from
the
action
of
her
own
mind
were
external
existences
that
thrust
themselves
imperiously
upon
her
like
haunting
visions
the
future
took
shape
after
shape
of
misery
before
her
always
ending
in
her
being
dragged
back
again
to
her
old
life
of
terror
and
stupor
and
fevered
despair
her
husband
had
so
long
overshadowed
her
life
that
her
imagination
could
not
keep
hold
of
a
condition
in
which
that
great
dread
was
absent
and
even
his
absence
what
was
it
only
a
dreary
vacant
flat
where
there
was
nothing
to
strive
after
nothing
to
long
for
at
last
the
light
of
morning
quenched
the
rushlight
and
thoughts
became
more
and
more
fragmentary
and
confused
she
was
every
moment
slipping
off
the
level
on
which
she
lay
thinking
down
down
into
some
depth
from
which
she
tried
to
rise
again
with
a
start
slumber
was
stealing
over
her
weary
brain
that
uneasy
slumber
which
is
only
better
than
wretched
waking
because
the
life
we
seemed
to
live
in
it
determines
no
wretched
future
because
the
things
we
do
and
suffer
in
it
are
but
hateful
shadows
and
leave
no
impress
that
petrifies
into
an
irrevocable
past
she
had
scarcely
been
asleep
an
hour
when
her
movements
became
more
violent
her
mutterings
more
frequent
and
agitated
till
at
last
she
started
up
with
a
smothered
cry
and
looked
wildly
round
her
shaking
with
terror
be
frightened
dear
dempster
said
pettifer
who
was
up
and
dressing
are
with
me
your
old
friend
pettifer
nothing
will
harm
you
janet
sank
back
again
on
her
pillow
still
trembling
after
lying
silent
a
little
while
she
said
was
a
horrible
dream
dear
pettifer
do
let
any
one
know
i
am
here
keep
it
a
secret
if
he
finds
out
he
will
come
and
drag
me
back
again
my
dear
depend
on
me
i
just
thought
i
shall
send
the
servant
home
on
a
holiday
i
promised
her
a
good
while
i
send
her
away
as
soon
as
she
had
her
breakfast
and
she
have
no
occasion
to
know
you
here
there
no
holding
servants
tongues
if
you
let
know
anything
what
they
do
know
they
wo
tell
you
may
trust
so
far
but
should
you
like
me
to
go
and
fetch
your
mother
not
yet
not
yet
i
ca
bear
to
see
her
yet
it
shall
be
just
as
you
like
now
try
and
get
to
sleep
again
i
shall
leave
you
for
an
hour
or
two
and
send
off
phoebe
and
then
bring
you
some
breakfast
i
lock
the
door
behind
me
so
that
the
girl
come
in
by
chance
the
daylight
changes
the
aspect
of
misery
to
us
as
of
everything
else
in
the
night
it
presses
on
our
imagination
the
forms
it
takes
are
false
fitful
exaggerated
in
broad
day
it
sickens
our
sense
with
the
dreary
persistence
of
definite
measurable
reality
the
man
who
looks
with
ghastly
horror
on
all
his
property
aflame
in
the
dead
of
night
has
not
half
the
sense
of
destitution
he
will
have
in
the
morning
when
he
walks
over
the
ruins
lying
blackened
in
the
pitiless
sunshine
that
moment
of
intensest
depression
was
come
to
janet
when
the
daylight
which
showed
her
the
walls
and
chairs
and
tables
and
all
the
commonplace
reality
that
surrounded
her
seemed
to
lay
bare
the
future
too
and
bring
out
into
oppressive
distinctness
all
the
details
of
a
weary
life
to
be
lived
from
day
to
day
with
no
hope
to
strengthen
her
against
that
evil
habit
which
she
loathed
in
retrospect
and
yet
was
powerless
to
resist
her
husband
would
never
consent
to
her
living
away
from
him
she
was
become
necessary
to
his
tyranny
he
would
never
willingly
loosen
his
grasp
on
her
she
had
a
vague
notion
of
some
protection
the
law
might
give
her
if
she
could
prove
her
life
in
danger
from
him
but
she
shrank
utterly
as
she
had
always
done
from
any
active
public
resistance
or
vengeance
she
felt
too
crushed
too
faulty
too
liable
to
reproach
to
have
the
courage
even
if
she
had
had
the
wish
to
put
herself
openly
in
the
position
of
a
wronged
woman
seeking
redress
she
had
no
strength
to
sustain
her
in
a
course
of
and
independence
there
was
a
darker
shadow
over
her
life
than
the
dread
of
her
husband
it
was
the
shadow
of
the
easiest
thing
would
be
to
go
away
and
hide
herself
from
him
but
then
there
was
her
mother
robert
had
all
her
little
property
in
his
hands
and
that
little
was
scarcely
enough
to
keep
her
in
comfort
without
his
aid
if
janet
went
away
alone
he
would
be
sure
to
persecute
her
mother
and
if
she
go
away
what
then
she
must
work
to
maintain
herself
she
must
exert
herself
weary
and
hopeless
as
she
was
to
begin
life
afresh
how
hard
that
seemed
to
her
nature
did
not
belie
her
grand
face
and
form
there
was
energy
there
was
strength
in
it
but
it
was
the
strength
of
the
vine
which
must
have
its
broad
leaves
and
rich
clusters
borne
up
by
a
firm
stay
and
now
she
had
nothing
to
rest
on
no
faith
no
love
if
her
mother
had
been
very
feeble
aged
or
sickly
janet
deep
pity
and
tenderness
might
have
made
a
daughter
duties
an
interest
and
a
solace
but
raynor
had
never
needed
tendance
she
had
always
been
giving
help
to
her
daughter
she
had
always
been
a
sort
of
humble
ministering
spirit
and
it
was
one
of
janet
pangs
of
memory
that
instead
of
being
her
mother
comfort
she
had
been
her
mother
trial
everywhere
the
same
sadness
her
life
was
a
barren
tract
where
there
was
no
shadow
and
where
all
the
waters
were
bitter
no
she
suddenly
thought
and
the
thought
was
like
an
electric
shock
there
was
one
spot
in
her
memory
which
seemed
to
promise
her
an
untried
spring
where
the
waters
might
be
sweet
that
short
interview
with
tryan
had
come
back
upon
her
his
voice
his
words
his
look
which
told
her
that
he
knew
sorrow
his
words
have
implied
that
he
thought
his
death
was
near
yet
he
had
a
faith
which
enabled
him
to
labour
enabled
him
to
give
comfort
to
others
that
look
of
his
came
back
on
her
with
a
vividness
greater
than
it
had
had
for
her
in
reality
surely
he
knew
more
of
the
secrets
of
sorrow
than
other
men
perhaps
he
had
some
message
of
comfort
different
from
the
feeble
words
she
had
been
used
to
hear
from
others
she
was
tired
she
was
sick
of
that
barren
exhortation
do
right
and
keep
a
clear
conscience
and
god
will
reward
you
and
your
troubles
will
be
easier
to
bear
she
wanted
to
do
right
she
wanted
something
to
rely
on
besides
her
own
resolutions
for
was
not
the
path
behind
her
all
strewn
with
resolutions
how
could
she
trust
in
new
ones
she
had
often
heard
tryan
laughed
at
for
being
fond
of
great
sinners
she
began
to
see
a
new
meaning
in
those
words
he
would
perhaps
understand
her
helplessness
her
wants
if
she
could
pour
out
her
heart
to
him
if
she
could
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
unlock
all
the
chambers
of
her
soul
the
impulse
to
confession
almost
always
requires
the
presence
of
a
fresh
ear
and
a
fresh
heart
and
in
our
moments
of
spiritual
need
the
man
to
whom
we
have
no
tie
but
our
common
nature
seems
nearer
to
us
than
mother
brother
or
friend
our
daily
familiar
life
is
but
a
hiding
of
ourselves
from
each
other
behind
a
screen
of
trivial
words
and
deeds
and
those
who
sit
with
us
at
the
same
hearth
are
often
the
farthest
off
from
the
deep
human
soul
within
us
full
of
unspoken
evil
and
unacted
good
when
pettifer
came
back
to
her
turning
the
key
and
opening
the
door
very
gently
janet
instead
of
being
asleep
as
her
good
friend
had
hoped
was
intensely
occupied
with
her
new
thought
she
longed
to
ask
pettifer
if
she
could
see
tryan
but
she
was
arrested
by
doubts
and
timidity
he
might
not
feel
for
her
he
might
be
shocked
at
her
confession
he
might
talk
to
her
of
doctrines
she
could
not
understand
or
believe
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
yet
but
she
was
too
restless
under
this
mental
struggle
to
remain
in
bed
pettifer
she
said
ca
lie
here
any
longer
i
must
get
up
will
you
lend
me
some
clothes
wrapt
in
such
drapery
as
pettifer
could
find
for
her
tall
figure
janet
went
down
into
the
little
parlour
and
tried
to
take
some
of
the
breakfast
her
friend
had
prepared
for
her
but
her
effort
was
not
a
successful
one
her
cup
of
tea
and
bit
of
toast
were
only
half
finished
the
leaden
weight
of
discouragement
pressed
upon
her
more
and
more
heavily
the
wind
had
fallen
and
a
drizzling
rain
had
come
on
there
was
no
prospect
from
pettifer
parlour
but
a
blank
wall
and
as
janet
looked
out
at
the
window
the
rain
and
the
bricks
seemed
to
blend
themselves
in
sickening
identity
with
her
desolation
of
spirit
and
the
headachy
weariness
of
her
body
pettifer
got
through
her
household
work
as
soon
as
she
could
and
sat
down
with
her
sewing
hoping
that
janet
would
perhaps
be
able
to
talk
a
little
of
what
had
passed
and
find
some
relief
by
unbosoming
herself
in
that
way
but
janet
could
not
speak
to
her
she
was
importuned
with
the
longing
to
see
tryan
and
yet
hesitating
to
express
it
two
hours
passed
in
this
way
the
rain
went
on
drizzling
and
janet
sat
still
leaning
her
aching
head
on
her
hand
and
looking
alternately
at
the
fire
and
out
of
the
window
she
felt
this
could
not
last
this
motionless
vacant
misery
she
must
determine
on
something
she
must
take
some
step
and
yet
everything
was
so
difficult
it
was
one
and
pettifer
rose
from
her
seat
saying
must
go
and
see
about
dinner
the
movement
and
the
sound
startled
janet
from
her
reverie
it
seemed
as
if
an
opportunity
were
escaping
her
and
she
said
hastily
tryan
in
the
town
today
do
you
think
i
should
think
not
being
saturday
you
know
said
pettifer
her
face
lighting
up
with
pleasure
he
come
if
he
was
sent
for
i
can
send
jesson
boy
with
a
note
to
him
any
time
should
you
like
to
see
him
i
think
i
should
i
send
for
him
this
instant
chapter
when
dempster
awoke
in
the
morning
he
was
at
no
loss
to
account
to
himself
for
the
fact
that
janet
was
not
by
his
side
his
hours
of
drunkenness
were
not
cut
off
from
his
other
hours
by
any
blank
wall
of
oblivion
he
remembered
what
janet
had
done
to
offend
him
the
evening
before
he
remembered
what
he
had
done
to
her
at
midnight
just
as
he
would
have
remembered
if
he
had
been
consulted
about
a
right
of
road
the
remembrance
gave
him
a
definite
ground
for
the
extra
which
had
attended
his
waking
every
morning
this
week
but
he
would
not
admit
to
himself
that
it
cost
him
any
anxiety
he
said
inwardly
would
go
straight
to
her
mother
she
as
timid
as
a
hare
and
never
let
anybody
know
about
it
she
be
back
again
before
night
but
it
would
be
as
well
for
the
servants
not
to
know
anything
of
the
affair
so
he
collected
the
clothes
she
had
taken
off
the
night
before
and
threw
them
into
a
closet
of
which
he
always
kept
the
key
in
his
pocket
when
he
went
down
stairs
he
said
to
the
housemaid
dempster
is
gone
to
her
mother
bring
in
the
breakfast
the
servants
accustomed
to
hear
domestic
broils
and
to
see
their
mistress
put
on
her
bonnet
hastily
and
go
to
her
mother
thought
it
only
something
a
little
worse
than
usual
that
she
should
have
gone
thither
in
consequence
of
a
violent
quarrel
either
at
midnight
or
in
the
early
morning
before
they
were
up
the
housemaid
told
the
cook
what
she
supposed
had
happened
the
cook
shook
her
head
and
said
dear
dear
but
they
both
expected
to
see
their
mistress
back
again
in
an
hour
or
two
dempster
on
his
return
home
the
evening
before
had
ordered
his
man
who
lived
away
from
the
house
to
bring
up
his
horse
and
gig
from
the
stables
at
ten
after
breakfast
he
said
to
the
housemaid
one
need
sit
up
for
me
i
shall
not
be
at
home
till
tomorrow
evening
and
then
he
walked
to
the
office
to
give
some
orders
expecting
as
he
returned
to
see
the
man
waiting
with
his
gig
but
though
the
church
clock
had
struck
ten
no
gig
was
there
in
dempster
mood
this
was
more
than
enough
to
exasperate
him
he
went
in
to
take
his
accustomed
glass
of
brandy
before
setting
out
promising
himself
the
satisfaction
of
presently
thundering
at
dawes
for
being
a
few
minutes
behind
his
time
an
outbreak
of
temper
towards
his
man
was
not
common
with
him
for
dempster
like
most
tyrannous
people
had
that
dastardly
kind
of
which
enabled
him
to
control
his
temper
where
it
suited
his
own
convenience
to
do
so
and
feeling
the
value
of
dawes
a
steady
punctual
fellow
he
not
only
gave
him
high
wages
but
usually
treated
him
with
exceptional
civility
this
morning
however
got
the
better
of
prudence
and
dempster
was
determined
to
rate
him
soundly
a
resolution
for
which
dawes
gave
him
much
better
ground
than
he
expected
five
minutes
ten
minutes
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
passed
and
dempster
was
setting
off
to
the
stables
in
a
back
street
to
see
what
was
the
cause
of
the
delay
when
dawes
appeared
with
the
gig
the
devil
do
you
keep
me
here
for
thundered
dempster
my
heels
like
a
beggarly
tailor
waiting
for
a
carrier

of
an
hour
after

time

dempster

into
the
gig

beastly
idiot
like
you

dempster
furious
snatched
the
whip
from
the
socket
and
gave
dawes
a
cut
which
he
meant
to
fall
across
his
shoulders
saying
that
sir
and
go
to
hell
with
you
dawes
was
in
the
act
of
turning
with
the
reins
in
his
hand
when
the
lash
fell
and
the
cut
went
across
his
face
with
white
lips
he
said
have
the
law
on
yer
for
that
lawyer
as
and
threw
the
reins
on
the
horse
back
dempster
leaned
forward
seized
the
reins
and
drove
off
there
your
friend
dempster
driving
out
without
his
man
again
said
luke
byles
who
was
chatting
with
budd
in
the
bridge
way
a
fool
he
is
to
drive
that
thing
he
get
pitched
on
his
head
one
of
these
days
he
said
budd
nodding
to
dempster
as
he
passed
got
nine
lives
dempster
has
chapter
it
was
dusk
and
the
candles
were
lighted
before
tryan
knocked
at
pettifer
door
her
messenger
had
brought
back
word
that
he
was
not
at
home
and
all
afternoon
janet
had
been
agitated
by
the
fear
that
he
would
not
come
but
as
soon
as
that
anxiety
was
removed
by
the
knock
at
the
door
she
felt
a
sudden
rush
of
doubt
and
timidity
she
trembled
and
turned
cold
pettifer
went
to
open
the
door
and
told
tryan
in
as
few
words
as
possible
what
had
happened
in
the
night
as
he
laid
down
his
hat
and
prepared
to
enter
the
parlour
she
said
wo
go
in
with
you
for
i
think
perhaps
she
would
rather
see
you
go
in
alone
janet
wrapped
up
in
a
large
white
shawl
which
threw
her
dark
face
into
startling
relief
was
seated
with
her
eyes
turned
anxiously
towards
the
door
when
tryan
entered
he
had
not
seen
her
since
their
interview
at
sally
martin
long
months
ago
and
he
felt
a
strong
movement
of
compassion
at
the
sight
of
the
face
which
seemed
to
bear
written
on
it
the
signs
of
all
janet
intervening
misery
her
heart
gave
a
great
leap
as
her
eyes
met
his
once
more
no
she
had
not
deceived
herself
there
was
all
the
sincerity
all
the
sadness
all
the
deep
pity
in
them
her
memory
had
told
her
of
more
than
it
had
told
her
for
in
proportion
as
his
face
had
become
thinner
and
more
worn
his
eyes
appeared
to
have
gathered
intensity
he
came
forward
and
putting
out
his
hand
said
am
so
glad
you
sent
for
me
i
am
so
thankful
you
thought
i
could
be
any
comfort
to
you
janet
took
his
hand
in
silence
she
was
unable
to
utter
any
words
of
mere
politeness
or
even
of
gratitude
her
heart
was
too
full
of
other
words
that
had
welled
up
the
moment
she
met
his
pitying
glance
and
felt
her
doubts
fall
away
they
sat
down
opposite
each
other
and
she
said
in
a
low
voice
while
slow
difficult
tears
gathered
in
her
aching
eyes
want
to
tell
you
how
unhappy
i
am
how
weak
and
wicked
i
feel
no
strength
to
live
or
die
i
thought
you
could
tell
me
something
that
would
help
me
she
paused
i
can
tryan
said
in
speaking
to
me
you
are
speaking
to
a
who
has
needed
just
the
comfort
and
help
you
are
needing
you
did
find
it
and
i
trust
you
will
find
it
i
should
like
to
be
good
and
to
do
right
janet
burst
forth
indeed
indeed
my
lot
has
been
a
very
hard
one
i
loved
my
husband
very
dearly
when
we
were
married
and
i
meant
to
make
him
happy
i
wanted
nothing
else
but
he
began
to
be
angry
with
me
for
little
things
and
i
do
want
to
accuse
him
but
he
drank
and
got
more
and
more
unkind
to
me
and
then
very
cruel
and
he
beat
me
and
that
cut
me
to
the
heart
it
made
me
almost
mad
sometimes
to
think
all
our
love
had
come
to
that
i
could
bear
up
against
it
i
had
never
been
used
to
drink
anything
but
water
i
hated
wine
and
spirits
because
robert
drank
them
so
but
one
day
when
i
was
very
wretched
and
the
wine
was
standing
on
the
table
i
suddenly
i
can
hardly
remember
how
i
came
to
do
it
i
poured
some
wine
into
a
large
glass
and
drank
it
it
blunted
my
feelings
and
made
me
more
indifferent
after
that
the
temptation
was
always
coming
and
it
got
stronger
and
stronger
i
was
ashamed
and
i
hated
what
i
did
but
almost
while
the
thought
was
passing
through
my
mind
that
i
would
never
do
it
again
i
did
it
it
seemed
as
if
there
was
a
demon
in
me
always
making
me
rush
to
do
what
i
longed
not
to
do
and
i
thought
all
the
more
that
god
was
cruel
for
if
he
had
not
sent
me
that
dreadful
trial
so
much
worse
than
other
women
have
to
bear
i
should
not
have
done
wrong
in
that
way
i
suppose
it
is
wicked
to
think
so
i
feel
as
if
there
must
be
goodness
and
right
above
us
but
i
ca
see
it
i
trust
in
it
and
i
have
gone
on
in
that
way
for
years
and
years
at
one
time
it
used
to
be
better
now
and
then
but
everything
has
got
worse
lately
i
felt
sure
it
must
soon
end
somehow
and
last
night
he
turned
me
out
of
doors
i
do
know
what
to
do
i
will
never
go
back
to
that
life
again
if
i
can
help
it
and
yet
everything
else
seems
so
miserable
i
feel
sure
that
demon
will
always
be
urging
me
to
satisfy
the
craving
that
comes
upon
me
and
the
days
will
go
on
as
they
have
done
through
all
those
miserable
years
i
shall
always
be
doing
wrong
and
hating
myself
after
sinking
lower
and
lower
and
knowing
that
i
am
sinking
o
can
you
tell
me
any
way
of
getting
strength
have
you
ever
known
any
one
like
me
that
got
peace
of
mind
and
power
to
do
right
can
you
give
me
any
comfort
any
hope
while
janet
was
speaking
she
had
forgotten
everything
but
her
misery
and
her
yearning
for
comfort
her
voice
had
risen
from
the
low
tone
of
timid
distress
to
an
intense
pitch
of
imploring
anguish
she
clasped
her
hands
tightly
and
looked
at
tryon
with
eager
questioning
eyes
with
parted
trembling
lips
with
the
deep
horizontal
lines
of
overmastering
pain
on
her
brow
in
this
artificial
life
of
ours
it
is
not
often
we
see
a
human
face
with
all
a
heart
agony
in
it
uncontrolled
by
when
we
do
see
it
it
startles
us
as
if
we
had
suddenly
waked
into
the
real
world
of
which
this
everyday
one
is
but
a
copy
for
some
moments
tryan
was
too
deeply
moved
to
speak
dear
dempster
he
said
at
last
comfort
there
hope
for
you
believe
me
there
is
for
i
speak
from
my
own
deep
and
hard
experience
he
paused
as
if
he
had
not
made
up
his
mind
to
utter
the
words
that
were
urging
themselves
to
his
lips
presently
he
continued
years
ago
i
felt
as
wretched
as
you
do
i
think
my
wretchedness
was
even
worse
than
yours
for
i
had
a
heavier
sin
on
my
conscience
i
had
suffered
no
wrong
from
others
as
you
have
and
i
had
injured
another
irreparably
in
body
and
soul
the
image
of
the
wrong
i
had
done
pursued
me
everywhere
and
i
seemed
on
the
brink
of
madness
i
hated
my
life
for
i
thought
just
as
you
do
that
i
should
go
on
falling
into
temptation
and
doing
more
harm
in
the
world
and
i
dreaded
death
for
with
that
sense
of
guilt
on
my
soul
i
felt
that
whatever
state
i
entered
on
must
be
one
of
misery
but
a
dear
friend
to
whom
i
opened
my
mind
showed
me
it
was
just
such
as
i
the
helpless
who
feel
themselves
helpless
that
god
specially
invites
to
come
to
him
and
offers
all
the
riches
of
his
salvation
not
forgiveness
only
forgiveness
would
be
worth
little
if
it
left
us
under
the
powers
of
our
evil
passions
but
strength
that
strength
which
enables
us
to
conquer
sin
said
janet
can
feel
no
trust
in
god
he
seems
always
to
have
left
me
to
myself
i
have
sometimes
prayed
to
him
to
help
me
and
yet
everything
has
been
just
the
same
as
before
if
you
felt
like
me
how
did
you
come
to
have
hope
and
trust
not
believe
that
god
has
left
you
to
yourself
how
can
you
tell
but
that
the
hardest
trials
you
have
known
have
been
only
the
road
by
which
he
was
leading
you
to
that
complete
sense
of
your
own
sin
and
helplessness
without
which
you
would
never
have
renounced
all
other
hopes
and
trusted
in
his
love
alone
i
know
dear
dempster
i
know
it
is
hard
to
bear
i
would
not
speak
lightly
of
your
sorrows
i
feel
that
the
mystery
of
our
life
is
great
and
at
one
time
it
seemed
as
dark
to
me
as
it
does
to
you
tryan
hesitated
again
he
saw
that
the
first
thing
janet
needed
was
to
be
assured
of
sympathy
she
must
be
made
to
feel
that
her
anguish
was
not
strange
to
him
that
he
entered
into
the
only
secrets
of
her
spiritual
weakness
before
any
other
message
of
consolation
could
find
its
way
to
her
heart
the
tale
of
the
divine
pity
was
never
yet
believed
from
lips
that
were
not
felt
to
be
moved
by
human
pity
and
janet
anguish
was
not
strange
to
tryan
he
had
never
been
in
the
presence
of
a
sorrow
and
a
that
had
sent
so
strong
a
thrill
through
all
the
recesses
of
his
saddest
experience
and
it
is
because
sympathy
is
but
a
living
again
through
our
own
past
in
a
new
form
that
confession
often
prompts
a
response
of
confession
tryan
felt
this
prompting
and
his
judgement
too
told
him
that
in
obeying
it
he
would
be
taking
the
best
means
of
administering
comfort
to
janet
yet
he
hesitated
as
we
tremble
to
let
in
the
daylight
on
a
chamber
of
relics
which
we
have
never
visited
except
in
curtained
silence
but
the
first
impulse
triumphed
and
he
went
on
had
lived
all
my
life
at
a
distance
from
god
my
youth
was
spent
in
thoughtless
and
all
my
hopes
were
of
a
vain
worldly
kind
i
had
no
thought
of
entering
the
church
i
looked
forward
to
a
political
career
for
my
father
was
private
secretary
to
a
man
high
in
the
whig
ministry
and
had
been
promised
strong
interest
in
my
behalf
at
college
i
lived
in
intimacy
with
the
gayest
men
even
adopting
follies
and
vices
for
which
i
had
no
taste
out
of
mere
pliancy
and
the
love
of
standing
well
with
my
companions
you
see
i
was
more
guilty
even
then
than
you
have
been
for
i
threw
away
all
the
rich
blessings
of
untroubled
youth
and
health
i
had
no
excuse
in
my
outward
lot
but
while
i
was
at
college
that
event
in
my
life
occurred
which
in
the
end
brought
on
the
state
of
mind
i
have
mentioned
to
you
the
state
of
and
despair
which
enables
me
to
understand
to
the
full
what
you
are
suffering
and
i
tell
you
the
facts
because
i
want
you
to
be
assured
that
i
am
not
uttering
mere
vague
words
when
i
say
that
i
have
been
raised
from
as
low
a
depth
of
sin
and
sorrow
as
that
in
which
you
feel
yourself
to
be
at
college
i
had
an
attachment
to
a
lovely
girl
of
seventeen
she
was
very
much
below
my
own
station
in
life
and
i
never
contemplated
marrying
her
but
i
induced
her
to
leave
her
father
house
i
did
not
mean
to
forsake
her
when
i
left
college
and
i
quieted
all
scruples
of
conscience
by
promising
myself
that
i
would
always
take
care
of
poor
lucy
but
on
my
return
from
a
vacation
spent
in
travelling
i
found
that
lucy
was
gone
gone
away
with
a
gentleman
her
neighbours
said
i
was
a
good
deal
distressed
but
i
tried
to
persuade
myself
that
no
harm
would
come
to
her
soon
afterwards
i
had
an
illness
which
left
my
health
delicate
and
made
all
dissipation
distasteful
to
me
life
seemed
very
wearisome
and
empty
and
i
looked
with
envy
on
every
one
who
had
some
great
and
absorbing
object
even
on
my
cousin
who
was
preparing
to
go
out
as
a
missionary
and
whom
i
had
been
used
to
think
a
dismal
tedious
person
because
he
was
constantly
urging
religious
subjects
upon
me
we
were
living
in
london
then
it
was
three
years
since
i
had
lost
sight
of
lucy
and
one
summer
evening
about
nine
as
i
was
walking
along
gower
street
i
saw
a
knot
of
people
on
the
causeway
before
me
as
i
came
up
to
them
i
heard
one
woman
say
i
tell
you
she
is
dead
this
awakened
my
interest
and
i
pushed
my
way
within
the
circle
the
body
of
a
woman
dressed
in
fine
clothes
was
lying
against
a
her
head
was
bent
on
one
side
and
the
long
curls
had
fallen
over
her
cheek
a
tremor
seized
me
when
i
saw
the
hair
it
was
light
chestnut
the
colour
of
lucy
i
knelt
down
and
turned
aside
the
hair
it
was
lucy
dead
with
paint
on
her
cheeks
i
found
out
afterwards
that
she
had
taken
poison
that
she
was
in
the
power
of
a
wicked
woman
that
the
very
clothes
on
her
back
were
not
her
own
it
was
then
that
my
past
life
burst
upon
me
in
all
its
hideousness
i
wished
i
had
never
been
born
i
could
look
into
the
future
lucy
dead
painted
face
would
follow
me
there
as
it
did
when
i
looked
back
into
the
past
as
it
did
when
i
sat
down
to
table
with
my
friends
when
i
lay
down
in
my
bed
and
when
i
rose
up
there
was
only
one
thing
that
could
make
life
tolerable
to
me
that
was
to
spend
all
the
rest
of
it
in
trying
to
save
others
from
the
ruin
i
had
brought
on
one
but
how
was
that
possible
for
me
i
had
no
comfort
no
strength
no
wisdom
in
my
own
soul
how
could
i
give
them
to
others
my
mind
was
dark
rebellious
at
war
with
itself
and
with
god
tryan
had
been
looking
away
from
janet
his
face
was
towards
the
fire
and
he
was
absorbed
in
the
images
his
memory
was
recalling
but
now
he
turned
his
eyes
on
her
and
they
met
hers
fixed
on
him
with
the
look
of
rapt
expectation
with
which
one
clinging
to
a
slippery
summit
of
a
rock
while
the
waves
are
rising
higher
and
higher
watches
the
boat
that
has
put
from
shore
to
his
rescue
see
dempster
how
deep
my
need
was
i
went
on
in
this
way
for
months
i
was
convinced
that
if
i
ever
got
health
and
comfort
it
must
be
from
religion
i
went
to
hear
celebrated
preachers
and
i
read
religious
books
but
i
found
nothing
that
fitted
my
own
need
the
faith
which
puts
the
sinner
in
possession
of
salvation
seemed
as
i
understood
it
to
be
quite
out
of
my
reach
i
had
no
faith
i
only
felt
utterly
wretched
under
the
power
of
habits
and
dispositions
which
had
wrought
hideous
evil
at
last
as
i
told
you
i
found
a
friend
to
whom
i
opened
all
my
feelings
to
whom
i
confessed
everything
he
was
a
man
who
had
gone
through
very
deep
experience
and
could
understand
the
different
wants
of
different
minds
he
made
it
clear
to
me
that
the
only
preparation
for
coming
to
christ
and
partaking
of
his
salvation
was
that
very
sense
of
guilt
and
helplessness
which
was
weighing
me
down
he
said
you
are
weary
and
well
it
is
you
christ
invites
to
come
to
him
and
find
rest
he
asks
you
to
cling
to
him
to
lean
on
him
he
does
not
command
you
to
walk
alone
without
stumbling
he
does
not
tell
you
as
your
do
that
you
must
first
merit
his
love
he
neither
condemns
nor
reproaches
you
for
the
past
he
only
bids
you
come
to
him
that
you
may
have
life
he
bids
you
stretch
out
your
hands
and
take
of
the
fulness
of
his
love
you
have
only
to
rest
on
him
as
a
child
rests
on
its
mother
arms
and
you
will
be
upborne
by
his
divine
strength
that
is
what
is
meant
by
faith
your
evil
habits
you
feel
are
too
strong
for
you
you
are
unable
to
wrestle
with
them
you
know
beforehand
you
shall
fall
but
when
once
we
feel
our
helplessness
in
that
way
and
go
to
the
saviour
desiring
to
be
freed
from
the
power
as
well
as
the
punishment
of
sin
we
are
no
longer
left
to
our
own
strength
as
long
as
we
live
in
rebellion
against
god
desiring
to
have
our
own
will
seeking
happiness
in
the
things
of
this
world
it
is
as
if
we
shut
ourselves
up
in
a
crowded
stifling
room
where
we
breathe
only
poisoned
air
but
we
have
only
to
walk
out
under
the
infinite
heavens
and
we
breathe
the
pure
free
air
that
gives
us
health
and
strength
and
gladness
it
is
just
so
with
god
spirit
as
soon
as
we
submit
ourselves
to
his
will
as
soon
as
we
desire
to
be
united
to
him
and
made
pure
and
holy
it
is
as
if
the
walls
had
fallen
down
that
shut
us
out
from
god
and
we
are
fed
with
his
spirit
which
gives
us
new
strength
is
what
i
want
said
janet
have
left
off
minding
about
pleasure
i
think
i
could
be
contented
in
the
midst
of
hardship
if
i
felt
that
god
cared
for
me
and
would
give
me
strength
to
lead
a
pure
life
but
tell
me
did
you
soon
find
peace
and
strength
perfect
peace
for
a
long
while
but
hope
and
trust
which
is
strength
no
sense
of
pardon
for
myself
could
do
away
with
the
pain
i
had
in
thinking
what
i
had
helped
to
bring
on
another
my
friend
used
to
urge
upon
me
that
my
sin
against
god
was
greater
than
my
sin
against
her
but
it
may
be
from
want
of
deeper
spiritual
feeling
that
has
remained
to
this
hour
the
sin
which
causes
me
the
bitterest
pang
i
could
never
rescue
lucy
but
by
god
blessing
i
might
rescue
other
weak
and
falling
souls
and
that
was
why
i
entered
the
church
i
asked
for
nothing
through
the
rest
of
my
life
but
that
i
might
be
devoted
to
god
work
without
swerving
in
search
of
pleasure
either
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
it
has
been
often
a
hard
struggle
but
god
has
been
with
me
and
perhaps
it
may
not
last
much
longer
tryan
paused
for
a
moment
he
had
forgotten
janet
and
for
a
moment
she
had
forgotten
her
own
sorrows
when
she
recurred
to
herself
it
was
with
a
new
feeling
what
a
difference
between
our
lives
you
have
been
choosing
pain
and
working
and
denying
yourself
and
i
have
been
thinking
only
of
myself
i
was
only
angry
and
discontented
because
i
had
pain
to
bear
you
never
had
that
wicked
feeling
that
i
have
had
so
often
did
you
that
god
was
cruel
to
send
me
trials
and
temptations
worse
than
others
have
i
had
i
had
very
blasphemous
thoughts
and
i
know
that
spirit
of
rebellion
must
have
made
the
worst
part
of
your
lot
you
did
not
feel
how
impossible
it
is
for
us
to
judge
rightly
of
god
dealings
and
you
opposed
yourself
to
his
will
but
what
do
we
know
we
can
not
foretell
the
working
of
the
smallest
event
in
our
own
lot
how
can
we
presume
to
judge
of
things
that
are
so
much
too
high
for
us
there
is
nothing
that
becomes
us
but
entire
submission
perfect
resignation
as
long
as
we
set
up
our
own
will
and
our
own
wisdom
against
god
we
make
that
wall
between
us
and
his
love
which
i
have
spoken
of
just
now
but
as
soon
as
we
lay
ourselves
entirely
at
his
feet
we
have
enough
light
given
us
to
guide
our
own
steps
as
the
who
hears
nothing
of
the
councils
that
determine
the
course
of
the
great
battle
he
is
in
hears
plainly
enough
the
word
of
command
which
he
must
himself
obey
i
know
dear
dempster
i
know
it
is
hard
the
hardest
thing
of
all
perhaps
to
flesh
and
blood
but
carry
that
difficulty
to
the
saviour
along
with
all
your
other
sins
and
weaknesses
and
ask
him
to
pour
into
you
a
spirit
of
submission
he
enters
into
your
struggles
he
has
drunk
the
cup
of
our
suffering
to
the
dregs
he
knows
the
hard
wrestling
it
costs
us
to
say
not
my
will
but
thine
be
done
with
me
said
janet
now
that
i
may
have
light
and
strength
chapter
before
leaving
janet
tryan
urged
her
strongly
to
send
for
her
mother
not
wound
her
he
said
shutting
her
out
any
longer
from
your
troubles
it
is
right
that
you
should
be
with
her
i
will
send
for
her
said
janet
i
would
rather
not
go
to
my
mother
yet
because
my
husband
is
sure
to
think
i
am
there
and
he
might
come
and
fetch
me
i
ca
go
back
to
him
at
least
not
yet
ought
i
to
go
back
to
him
certainly
not
at
present
something
should
be
done
to
secure
you
from
violence
your
mother
i
think
should
consult
some
confidential
friend
some
man
of
character
and
experience
who
might
mediate
between
you
and
your
husband
i
will
send
for
my
mother
directly
but
i
will
stay
here
with
pettifer
till
something
has
been
done
i
want
no
one
to
know
where
i
am
except
you
you
will
come
again
will
you
not
you
will
not
leave
me
to
myself
will
not
be
left
to
yourself
god
is
with
you
if
i
have
been
able
to
give
you
any
comfort
it
is
because
his
power
and
love
have
been
present
with
us
but
i
am
very
thankful
that
he
has
chosen
to
work
through
me
i
shall
see
you
again
tomorrow
not
before
evening
for
it
will
be
sunday
you
know
but
after
the
evening
lecture
i
shall
be
at
liberty
you
will
be
in
my
prayers
till
then
in
the
meantime
dear
dempster
open
your
heart
as
much
as
you
can
to
your
mother
and
pettifer
cast
away
from
you
the
pride
that
makes
us
shrink
from
acknowledging
our
weakness
to
our
friends
ask
them
to
help
you
in
guarding
yourself
from
the
least
approach
of
the
sin
you
most
dread
deprive
yourself
as
far
as
possible
of
the
very
means
and
opportunity
of
committing
it
every
effort
of
that
kind
made
in
humility
and
dependence
is
a
prayer
promise
me
you
will
do
this
i
promise
you
i
know
i
have
always
been
too
proud
i
could
never
bear
to
speak
to
any
one
about
myself
i
have
been
proud
towards
my
mother
even
it
has
always
made
me
angry
when
she
has
seemed
to
take
notice
of
my
faults
dear
dempster
you
will
never
say
again
that
life
is
blank
and
that
there
is
nothing
to
live
for
will
you
see
what
work
there
is
to
be
done
in
life
both
in
our
own
souls
and
for
others
surely
it
matters
little
whether
we
have
more
or
less
of
this
world
comfort
in
these
short
years
when
god
is
training
us
for
the
eternal
enjoyment
of
his
love
keep
that
great
end
of
life
before
you
and
your
troubles
here
will
seem
only
the
small
hardships
of
a
journey
now
i
must
go
tryan
rose
and
held
out
his
hand
janet
took
it
and
said
has
been
very
good
to
me
in
sending
you
to
me
i
will
trust
in
him
i
will
try
to
do
everything
you
tell
me
blessed
influence
of
one
true
loving
human
soul
on
another
not
calculable
by
algebra
not
deducible
by
logic
but
mysterious
effectual
mighty
as
the
hidden
process
by
which
the
tiny
seed
is
quickened
and
bursts
forth
into
tall
stem
and
broad
leaf
and
glowing
tasseled
flower
ideas
are
often
poor
ghosts
our
eyes
can
not
discern
them
they
pass
athwart
us
in
thin
vapour
and
can
not
make
themselves
felt
but
sometimes
they
are
made
flesh
they
breathe
upon
us
with
warm
breath
they
touch
us
with
soft
responsive
hands
they
look
at
us
with
sad
sincere
eyes
and
speak
to
us
in
appealing
tones
they
are
clothed
in
a
living
human
soul
with
all
its
conflicts
its
faith
and
its
love
then
their
presence
is
a
power
then
they
shake
us
like
a
passion
and
we
are
drawn
after
them
with
gentle
compulsion
as
flame
is
drawn
to
flame
janet
dark
grand
face
still
fatigued
had
become
quite
calm
and
looked
up
as
she
sat
with
a
humble
childlike
expression
at
the
thin
blond
face
and
slightly
sunken
grey
eyes
which
now
shone
with
hectic
brightness
she
might
have
been
taken
for
an
image
of
passionate
strength
beaten
and
worn
with
conflict
and
he
for
an
image
of
the
faith
which
has
soothed
that
conflict
into
rest
as
he
looked
at
the
sweet
submissive
face
he
remembered
its
look
of
despairing
anguish
and
his
heart
was
very
full
as
he
turned
away
from
her
me
only
live
to
see
this
work
confirmed
and
then
it
was
nearly
ten
when
tryan
left
but
janet
was
bent
on
sending
for
her
mother
so
pettifer
as
the
readiest
plan
put
on
her
bonnet
and
went
herself
to
fetch
raynor
the
mother
had
been
too
long
used
to
expect
that
every
fresh
week
would
be
more
painful
than
the
last
for
pettifer
news
to
come
upon
her
with
the
shock
of
a
surprise
quietly
without
any
show
of
distress
she
made
up
a
bundle
of
clothes
and
telling
her
little
maid
that
she
should
not
return
home
that
night
accompanied
pettifer
back
in
silence
when
they
entered
the
parlour
janet
wearied
out
had
sunk
to
sleep
in
the
large
chair
which
stood
with
its
back
to
the
door
the
noise
of
the
opening
door
disturbed
her
and
she
was
looking
round
wonderingly
when
raynor
came
up
to
her
chair
and
said
your
mother
janet
dear
mother
janet
cried
clasping
her
closely
have
not
been
a
good
tender
child
to
you
but
i
will
be
i
will
not
grieve
you
any
more
the
calmness
which
had
withstood
a
new
sorrow
was
overcome
by
a
new
joy
and
the
mother
burst
into
tears
chapter
on
sunday
morning
the
rain
had
ceased
and
janet
looking
out
of
the
bedroom
window
saw
above
the
a
shining
mass
of
white
cloud
rolling
under
the
blue
sky
it
was
going
to
be
a
lovely
april
day
the
fresh
sky
left
clear
and
calm
after
the
long
vexation
of
wind
and
rain
mingled
its
mild
influence
with
janet
new
thoughts
and
prospects
she
felt
a
buoyant
courage
that
surprised
herself
after
the
cold
crushing
weight
of
despondency
which
had
oppressed
her
the
day
before
she
could
think
even
of
her
husband
rage
without
the
old
overpowering
dread
for
a
delicious
hope
the
hope
of
purification
and
inward
peace
had
entered
into
janet
soul
and
made
it
there
as
well
as
in
the
outer
world
while
her
mother
was
brushing
and
coiling
up
her
thick
black
hair
a
favourite
task
because
it
seemed
to
renew
the
days
of
her
girlhood
janet
told
how
she
came
to
send
for
tryan
how
she
had
remembered
their
meeting
at
sally
martin
in
the
autumn
and
had
felt
an
irresistible
desire
to
see
him
and
tell
him
her
sins
and
her
troubles
see
god
goodness
now
mother
in
ordering
it
so
that
we
should
meet
in
that
way
to
overcome
my
prejudice
against
him
and
make
me
feel
that
he
was
good
and
then
bringing
it
back
to
my
mind
in
the
depth
of
my
trouble
you
know
what
foolish
things
i
used
to
say
about
him
knowing
nothing
of
him
all
the
while
and
yet
he
was
the
man
who
was
to
give
me
comfort
and
help
when
everything
else
failed
me
it
is
wonderful
how
i
feel
able
to
speak
to
him
as
i
never
have
done
to
any
one
before
and
how
every
word
he
says
to
me
enters
my
heart
and
has
a
new
meaning
for
me
i
think
it
must
be
because
he
has
felt
life
more
deeply
than
others
and
has
a
deeper
faith
i
believe
everything
he
says
at
once
his
words
come
to
me
like
rain
on
the
parched
ground
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
before
as
if
i
could
see
behind
people
words
as
one
sees
behind
a
screen
but
in
tryan
it
is
his
very
soul
that
speaks
my
dear
child
i
love
and
bless
him
for
your
sake
if
he
has
given
you
any
comfort
i
never
believed
the
harm
people
said
of
him
though
i
had
no
desire
to
go
and
hear
him
for
i
am
contented
with
ways
i
find
more
good
teaching
than
i
can
practise
in
reading
my
bible
at
home
and
hearing
crewe
at
church
but
your
wants
are
different
my
dear
and
we
are
not
all
led
by
the
same
road
that
was
certainly
good
advice
of
tryan
you
told
me
of
last
night
that
we
should
consult
some
one
that
may
interfere
for
you
with
your
husband
and
i
have
been
turning
it
over
in
my
mind
while
i
been
lying
awake
in
the
night
i
think
nobody
will
do
so
well
as
benjamin
landor
for
we
must
have
a
man
that
knows
the
law
and
that
robert
is
rather
afraid
of
and
perhaps
he
could
bring
about
an
agreement
for
you
to
live
apart
your
bound
to
maintain
you
you
know
and
if
you
liked
we
could
move
away
from
milby
and
live
somewhere
else
mother
we
must
do
nothing
yet
i
must
think
about
it
a
little
longer
i
have
a
different
feeling
this
morning
from
what
i
had
yesterday
something
seems
to
tell
me
that
i
must
go
back
to
robert
some
time
after
a
little
while
i
loved
him
once
better
than
all
the
world
and
i
have
never
had
any
children
to
love
there
were
things
in
me
that
were
wrong
and
i
should
like
to
make
up
for
them
if
i
can
my
dear
i
wo
persuade
you
think
of
it
a
little
longer
but
something
must
be
done
soon
i
wish
i
had
my
bonnet
and
shawl
and
black
gown
here
said
janet
after
a
few
minutes
silence
should
like
to
go
to
paddiford
church
and
hear
tryan
there
would
be
no
fear
of
my
meeting
robert
for
he
never
goes
out
on
a
sunday
morning
afraid
it
would
not
do
for
me
to
go
to
the
house
and
fetch
your
clothes
said
raynor
no
no
i
must
stay
quietly
here
while
you
two
go
to
church
i
will
be
pettifer
maid
and
get
the
dinner
ready
for
her
by
the
time
she
comes
back
dear
good
woman
she
was
so
tender
to
me
when
she
took
me
in
in
the
night
mother
and
all
the
next
day
when
i
could
speak
a
word
to
her
to
thank
her
chapter
the
servants
at
dempster
felt
some
surprise
when
the
morning
noon
and
evening
of
saturday
had
passed
and
still
their
mistress
did
not
reappear
very
odd
said
kitty
the
housemaid
as
she
trimmed
her
next
week
cap
while
betty
the
cook
looked
on
with
folded
arms
you
think
as
raynor
was
ill
and
sent
for
the
missis
afore
we
was
up
said
betty

had
been
that

kitty

i
the
yesterday
when
the

wonder
if

a
fresh
row
about

made
up
her
mind
not
to
come
back

i
the
right

said
betty

overrun
him
long
afore
now
if
it
had
been
me
i
would
stan
bein
mauled
as
she
is
by
no
husband
not
if
he
was
the
biggest
lord
i
the
land
it

at
that
price
i
sooner
be
a
cook
perkises
an
hev

an
bake
all
to
mind
at
once
she

as
she

a
drop
o

if
he

the

a
sperrit
like
me
he
mek
her
come
back
you
see
he
come
round
her
somehow
there
no
likelihood
of
her
coming
hack
though
so
i
should
think
we
might
fasten
the
doors
and
go
to
bed
when
we
like
on
sunday
morning
however
kitty
mind
became
disturbed
by
more
definite
and
alarming
conjectures
about
her
mistress
while
betty
encouraged
by
the
prospect
of
unwonted
leisure
was
sitting
down
to
continue
a
letter
which
had
long
lain
unfinished
between
the
leaves
of
her
bible
kitty
came
running
into
the
kitchen
and
said
betty
i
all
of
a
tremble
you
might
knock
me
down
wi
a
feather
i
just
looked
into
the
missis
wardrobe
an
there
both
her
bonnets
she
must
ha
gone
her
bonnet
an
then
i
remember
as
her
was
on
the
bed
yisterday
mornin
i
thought
she
put
away
to
be
washed
but
she
hed
for
i
been
lookin
it
my
belief
murdered
her
and
shut
her
up
i
that
closet
as
he
keeps
locked
he
capible
o
why
you
better
run
to
raynor
an
see
if
there
arter
all
it
was
all
a
lie
raynor
had
returned
home
to
give
directions
to
her
little
maiden
when
kitty
with
the
elaborate
manifestation
of
alarm
which
servants
delight
in
rushed
in
without
knocking
and
holding
her
hands
on
her
heart
as
if
the
consequences
to
that
organ
were
likely
to
be
very
serious
said
you
please
is
the
missis
here
kitty
why
are
you
come
to
ask
she
niver
been
at
home
since
yesterday
mornin
since
afore
we
was
up
an
we
thought
somethin
must
ha
happened
to
her
do
be
frightened
kitty
your
mistress
is
quite
safe
i
know
where
she
is
is
your

mornin
an
said
he

your
mistress

say
anything
to
any
one
about
her
being
away
from
home
i
shall
call
presently
and
fetch
her
gown
and
bonnet
she
wants
them
to
put
on
kitty
perceiving
there
was
a
mystery
she
was
not
to
inquire
into
returned
to
orchard
street
really
glad
to
know
that
her
mistress
was
safe
but
disappointed
nevertheless
at
being
told
that
she
was
not
to
be
frightened
she
was
soon
followed
by
raynor
in
quest
of
the
gown
and
bonnet
the
good
mother
on
learning
that
dempster
was
not
at
home
had
at
once
thought
that
she
could
gratify
janet
wish
to
go
to
paddiford
church
my
dear
she
said
as
she
entered
pettifer
parlour
brought
you
your
black
clothes
robert
not
at
home
and
is
not
coming
till
this
evening
i
could
find
your
best
black
gown
but
this
will
do
i
would
bring
anything
else
you
know
but
there
ca
be
any
objection
to
my
fetching
clothes
to
cover
you
you
can
go
to
paddiford
church
now
if
you
like
and
i
will
go
with
you
a
dear
mother
then
we
all
three
go
together
come
and
help
me
to
get
ready
good
little
crewe
it
will
vex
her
sadly
that
i
should
go
to
hear
tryan
but
i
must
kiss
her
and
make
it
up
with
her
many
eyes
were
turned
on
janet
with
a
look
of
surprise
as
she
walked
up
the
aisle
of
paddiford
church
she
felt
a
little
tremor
at
the
notice
she
knew
she
was
exciting
but
it
was
a
strong
satisfaction
to
her
that
she
had
been
able
at
once
to
take
a
step
that
would
let
her
neighbours
know
her
change
of
feeling
towards
tryan
she
had
left
herself
now
no
room
for
proud
reluctance
or
weak
hesitation
the
walk
through
the
sweet
spring
air
had
stimulated
all
her
fresh
hopes
all
her
yearning
desires
after
purity
strength
and
peace
she
thought
she
should
find
a
new
meaning
in
the
prayers
this
morning
her
full
heart
like
an
overflowing
river
wanted
those
channels
to
pour
itself
into
and
then
she
should
hear
tryan
again
and
his
words
would
fall
on
her
like
precious
balm
as
they
had
done
last
night
there
was
a
liquid
brightness
in
her
eyes
as
they
rested
on
the
mere
walls
the
pews
the
weavers
and
colliers
in
their
sunday
clothes
the
commonest
things
seemed
to
touch
the
spring
of
love
within
her
just
as
when
we
are
suddenly
released
from
an
acute
absorbing
bodily
pain
our
heart
and
senses
leap
out
in
new
freedom
we
think
even
the
noise
of
streets
harmonious
and
are
ready
to
hug
the
tradesman
who
is
wrapping
up
our
change
a
door
had
been
opened
in
janet
cold
dark
prison
of
and
the
golden
light
of
morning
was
pouring
in
its
slanting
beams
through
the
blessed
opening
there
was
sunlight
in
the
world
there
was
a
divine
love
caring
for
her
it
had
given
her
an
earnest
of
good
things
it
had
been
preparing
comfort
for
her
in
the
very
moment
when
she
had
thought
herself
most
forsaken
tryan
might
well
rejoice
when
his
eye
rested
on
her
as
he
entered
his
desk
but
he
rejoiced
with
trembling
he
could
not
look
at
the
sweet
hopeful
face
without
remembering
its
yesterday
look
of
agony
and
there
was
the
possibility
that
that
look
might
return
janet
appearance
at
church
was
greeted
not
only
by
wondering
eyes
but
by
kind
hearts
and
after
the
service
several
of
tryan
hearers
with
whom
she
had
been
on
cold
terms
of
late
contrived
to
come
up
to
her
and
take
her
by
the
hand
said
miss
linnet
let
us
go
and
speak
to
dempster
sure
there
a
great
change
in
her
mind
towards
tryan
i
noticed
how
eagerly
she
listened
to
the
sermon
and
she
come
with
pettifer
you
see
we
ought
to
go
and
give
her
a
welcome
among
us
my
dear
we
never
spoke
friendly
these
five
year
you
know
been
as
haughty
as
anything
since
i
quarrelled
with
her
husband
however
let
bygones
be
bygones
i
no
grudge
again
the
poor
thing
more
particular
as
she
must
ha
flew
in
her
husband
face
to
come
an
hear
tryan
yes
let
us
go
an
speak
to
her
the
friendly
words
and
looks
touched
janet
a
little
too
keenly
and
pettifer
wisely
hurried
her
home
by
the
road
when
they
reached
home
a
violent
fit
of
weeping
followed
by
continuous
lassitude
showed
that
the
emotions
of
the
morning
had
overstrained
her
nerves
she
was
suffering
too
from
the
absence
of
the
stimulus
which
she
had
promised
tryan
not
to
touch
again
the
poor
thing
was
conscious
of
this
and
dreaded
her
own
weakness
as
the
victim
of
intermittent
insanity
dreads
the
oncoming
of
the
old
illusion
she
whispered
when
raynor
urged
her
to
lie
down
and
rest
all
the
afternoon
that
she
might
be
the
better
prepared
to
see
tryan
in
the
evening
do
let
me
have
anything
if
i
ask
for
it
in
the
mother
mind
there
was
the
same
anxiety
and
in
her
it
was
mingled
with
another
fear
the
fear
lest
janet
in
her
present
excited
state
of
mind
should
take
some
premature
step
in
relation
to
her
husband
which
might
lead
back
to
all
the
former
troubles
the
hint
she
had
thrown
out
in
the
morning
of
her
wish
to
return
to
him
after
a
time
showed
a
new
eagerness
for
difficult
duties
that
only
made
the
sober
mother
tremble
but
as
evening
approached
morning
heroism
all
forsook
her
her
imagination
influenced
by
physical
depression
as
well
as
by
mental
habits
was
haunted
by
the
vision
of
her
husband
return
home
and
she
began
to
shudder
with
the
dread
she
heard
him
calling
her
she
saw
him
going
to
her
mother
to
look
for
her
she
felt
sure
he
would
find
her
out
and
burst
in
upon
her
pray
do
leave
me
do
go
to
church
she
said
to
pettifer
and
mother
both
stay
with
me
till
tryan
comes
at
twenty
minutes
past
six
the
church
bells
were
ringing
for
the
evening
service
and
soon
the
congregation
was
streaming
along
orchard
street
in
the
mellow
sunset
the
street
opened
toward
the
west
the
red
sun
shed
a
solemn
splendour
on
the
everyday
houses
and
crimsoned
the
windows
of
dempster
projecting
upper
storey
suddenly
a
loud
murmur
arose
and
spread
along
the
stream
of
and
one
group
after
another
paused
and
looked
backward
at
the
far
end
of
the
street
men
accompanied
by
a
miscellaneous
group
of
onlookers
were
slowly
carrying
something
a
body
stretched
on
a
door
slowly
they
passed
along
the
middle
of
the
street
lined
all
the
way
with
faces
till
they
turned
aside
and
paused
in
the
red
sunlight
before
door
it
was
dempster
body
no
one
knew
whether
he
was
alive
or
dead
chapter
it
was
probably
a
hard
saying
to
the
pharisees
that
is
more
joy
in
heaven
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
than
over
ninety
and
nine
just
persons
that
need
no
repentance
and
certain
ingenious
philosophers
of
our
own
day
must
surely
take
offence
at
a
joy
so
entirely
out
of
correspondence
with
arithmetical
proportion
but
a
heart
that
has
been
taught
by
its
own
sore
struggles
to
bleed
for
the
woes
of
another
that
has
pity
through
suffering
is
likely
to
find
very
imperfect
satisfaction
in
the
of
happiness
of
compensations
and
other
short
and
easy
methods
of
obtaining
thorough
complacency
in
the
presence
of
pain
and
for
such
a
heart
that
saying
will
not
be
altogether
dark
the
emotions
i
have
observed
are
but
slightly
influenced
by
arithmetical
considerations
the
mother
when
her
sweet
lisping
little
ones
have
all
been
taken
from
her
one
after
another
and
she
is
hanging
over
her
last
dead
babe
finds
small
consolation
in
the
fact
that
the
tiny
dimpled
corpse
is
but
one
of
a
necessary
average
and
that
a
thousand
other
babes
brought
into
the
world
at
the
same
time
are
doing
well
and
are
likely
to
live
and
if
you
stood
beside
that
mother
if
you
knew
her
pang
and
shared
it
it
is
probable
you
would
be
equally
unable
to
see
a
ground
of
complacency
in
statistics
doubtless
a
complacency
resting
on
that
basis
is
highly
rational
but
emotion
i
fear
is
obstinately
irrational
it
insists
on
caring
for
individuals
it
absolutely
refuses
to
adopt
the
quantitative
view
of
human
anguish
and
to
admit
that
thirteen
happy
lives
are
a
against
twelve
miserable
lives
which
leaves
a
clear
balance
on
the
side
of
satisfaction
this
is
the
inherent
imbecility
of
feeling
and
one
must
be
a
great
philosopher
to
have
got
quite
clear
of
all
that
and
to
have
emerged
into
the
serene
air
of
pure
intellect
in
which
it
is
evident
that
individuals
really
exist
for
no
other
purpose
than
that
abstractions
may
be
drawn
from
them
abstractions
that
may
rise
from
heaps
of
ruined
lives
like
the
sweet
savour
of
a
sacrifice
in
the
nostrils
of
philosophers
and
of
a
philosophic
deity
and
so
it
comes
to
pass
that
for
the
man
who
knows
sympathy
because
he
has
known
sorrow
that
old
old
saying
about
the
joy
of
angels
over
the
repentant
sinner
outweighing
their
joy
over
the
just
has
a
meaning
which
does
not
jar
with
the
language
of
his
own
heart
it
only
tells
him
that
for
angels
too
there
is
a
transcendent
value
in
human
pain
which
refuses
to
be
settled
by
equations
that
the
eyes
of
angels
too
are
turned
away
from
the
serene
happiness
of
the
righteous
to
bend
with
yearning
pity
on
the
poor
erring
soul
wandering
in
the
desert
where
no
water
is
that
for
angels
too
the
misery
of
one
casts
so
tremendous
a
shadow
as
to
eclipse
the
bliss
of
tryan
had
gone
through
the
initiation
of
suffering
it
is
no
wonder
then
that
janet
restoration
was
the
work
that
lay
nearest
his
heart
and
that
weary
as
he
was
in
body
when
he
entered
the
vestry
after
the
evening
service
he
was
impatient
to
fulfil
the
promise
of
seeing
her
his
experience
enabled
him
to
divine
what
was
the
fact
that
the
hopefulness
of
the
morning
would
be
followed
by
a
return
of
depression
and
discouragement
and
his
sense
of
the
inward
and
outward
difficulties
in
the
way
of
her
restoration
was
so
keen
that
he
could
only
find
relief
from
the
foreboding
it
excited
by
lifting
up
his
heart
in
prayer
there
are
unseen
elements
which
often
frustrate
our
wisest
calculations
which
raise
up
the
sufferer
from
the
edge
of
the
grave
contradicting
the
prophecies
of
the
physician
and
fulfilling
the
blind
clinging
hopes
of
affection
such
unseen
elements
tryan
called
the
divine
will
and
filled
up
the
margin
of
ignorance
which
surrounds
all
our
knowledge
with
the
feelings
of
trust
and
resignation
perhaps
the
profoundest
philosophy
could
hardly
fill
it
up
better
his
mind
was
occupied
in
this
way
as
he
was
absently
taking
off
his
gown
when
landor
startled
him
by
entering
the
vestry
and
asking
abruptly
you
heard
the
news
about
dempster
said
tryan
anxiously
is
it
has
been
thrown
out
of
his
gig
in
the
bridge
way
and
he
was
taken
up
for
dead
they
were
carrying
him
home
as
we
were
coming
to
church
and
i
stayed
behind
to
see
what
i
could
do
i
went
in
to
speak
to
dempster
and
prepare
her
a
little
but
she
was
not
at
home
dempster
is
not
dead
however
he
was
stunned
with
the
fall
pilgrim
came
in
a
few
minutes
and
he
says
the
right
leg
is
broken
in
two
places
it
likely
to
be
a
terrible
case
with
his
state
of
body
it
seems
he
was
more
drunk
than
usual
and
they
say
he
came
along
the
bridge
way
flogging
his
horse
like
a
madman
till
at
last
it
gave
a
sudden
wheel
and
he
was
pitched
out
the
servants
said
they
did
know
where
dempster
was
she
had
been
away
from
home
since
yesterday
morning
but
raynor
knew
know
where
she
is
said
tryan
i
think
it
will
be
better
for
her
not
to
be
told
of
this
just
yet
that
was
what
pilgrim
said
and
so
i
did
go
round
to
raynor
he
said
it
would
be
all
the
better
if
dempster
could
be
kept
out
of
the
house
for
the
present
do
you
know
if
anything
new
has
happened
between
dempster
and
his
wife
lately
i
was
surprised
to
hear
of
her
being
at
paddiford
church
this
morning
something
has
happened
but
i
believe
she
is
anxious
that
the
particulars
of
his
behaviour
towards
her
should
not
be
known
she
is
at
pettifer
there
is
no
reason
for
concealing
that
since
what
has
happened
to
her
husband
and
yesterday
when
she
was
in
very
deep
trouble
she
sent
for
me
i
was
very
thankful
she
did
so
i
believe
a
great
change
of
feeling
has
begun
in
her
but
she
is
at
present
in
that
excitable
state
of
mind
she
has
been
shaken
by
so
many
painful
emotions
during
the
last
two
days
that
i
think
it
would
be
better
for
this
evening
at
least
to
guard
her
from
a
new
shock
if
possible
but
i
am
going
now
to
call
upon
her
and
i
shall
see
how
she
is
tryan
said
jerome
who
had
entered
during
the
dialogue
and
had
been
standing
by
listening
with
a
distressed
face
shall
take
it
as
a
favour
if
you
let
me
know
if
iver
there
anything
i
can
do
for
dempster
eh
dear
what
a
world
this
is
i
think
i
see
fifteen
year
ago
as
happy
a
young
couple
as
iver
was
and
now
what
it
all
come
to
i
was
in
a
hurry
like
to
punish
dempster
for
pessecutin
but
there
was
a
stronger
hand
at
work
nor
mine
jerome
but
do
let
us
rejoice
in
punishment
even
when
the
hand
of
god
alone
inflicts
it
the
best
of
us
are
but
poor
wretches
just
saved
from
shipwreck
can
we
feel
anything
but
awe
and
pity
when
we
see
a
swallowed
by
the
waves
right
tryan
i
over
hot
and
hasty
that
i
am
but
i
beg
on
you
to
tell
dempster
i
mean
in
course
when
you
an
opportunity
tell
her
she
a
friend
at
the
white
house
as
she
may
send
for
any
hour
o
the
day
i
shall
have
an
opportunity
i
dare
say
and
i
will
remember
your
wish
i
think
continued
tryan
turning
to
landor
had
better
see
pilgrim
on
my
way
and
learn
what
is
exactly
the
state
of
things
by
this
time
what
do
you
think
all
means
if
dempster
is
to
know
there
no
one
can
break
the
news
to
her
so
well
as
you
i
walk
with
you
to
dempster
door
i
dare
say
pilgrim
is
there
still
come
jerome
you
got
to
go
our
way
too
to
fetch
your
horse
pilgrim
was
in
the
passage
giving
some
directions
to
his
assistant
when
to
his
surprise
he
saw
tryan
enter
they
shook
hands
for
pilgrim
never
having
joined
the
party
of
the
had
no
ground
for
resisting
the
growing
conviction
that
the
evangelical
curate
was
really
a
good
fellow
though
he
was
a
fool
for
not
taking
better
care
of
himself
i
did
expect
to
see
you
in
your
old
enemy
quarters
he
said
to
tryan
it
will
be
a
good
while
before
poor
dempster
shows
any
fight
again
came
on
dempster
account
said
tryan
is
staying
at
pettifer
she
has
had
a
great
shock
from
some
severe
domestic
trouble
lately
and
i
think
it
will
be
wiser
to
defer
telling
her
of
this
dreadful
event
for
a
short
time
what
has
been
up
eh
said
pilgrim
whose
curiosity
was
at
once
awakened
used
to
be
no
friend
of
yours
has
there
been
some
split
between
them
it
a
new
thing
for
her
to
turn
round
on
him
merely
an
exaggeration
of
scenes
that
must
often
have
happened
before
but
the
question
now
is
whether
you
think
there
is
any
immediate
danger
of
her
husband
death
for
in
that
case
i
think
from
what
i
have
observed
of
her
feelings
she
would
be
pained
afterwards
to
have
been
kept
in
ignorance
there
no
telling
in
these
cases
you
know
i
do
apprehend
speedy
death
and
it
is
not
absolutely
impossible
that
we
may
bring
him
round
again
at
present
he
in
a
state
of
apoplectic
stupor
but
if
that
subsides
delirium
is
almost
sure
to
supervene
and
we
shall
have
some
painful
scenes
it
one
of
those
complicated
cases
in
which
the
delirium
is
likely
to
be
of
the
worst
kind
meningitis
and
delirium
tremens
together
and
we
may
have
a
good
deal
of
trouble
with
him
if
dempster
were
told
i
should
say
it
would
be
desirable
to
persuade
her
to
remain
out
of
the
house
at
present
she
could
do
no
good
you
know
got
nurses
you
said
tryan
is
what
i
wanted
to
know
when
pettifer
opened
the
door
for
tryan
he
told
her
in
a
few
words
what
had
happened
and
begged
her
to
take
an
opportunity
of
letting
raynor
know
that
they
might
if
possible
concur
in
preventing
a
premature
or
sudden
disclosure
of
the
event
to
janet
thing
said
pettifer
not
fit
to
hear
any
bad
news
she
very
low
this
evening
worn
out
with
feeling
and
she
not
had
anything
to
keep
her
up
as
she
been
used
to
she
seems
frightened
at
the
thought
of
being
tempted
to
take
it
god
for
it
that
fear
is
her
greatest
security
when
tryan
entered
the
parlour
this
time
janet
was
again
awaiting
him
eagerly
and
her
pale
sad
face
was
lighted
up
with
a
smile
as
she
rose
to
meet
him
but
the
next
moment
she
said
with
a
look
of
anxiety
very
ill
and
tired
you
look
you
have
been
working
so
hard
all
day
and
yet
you
are
come
to
talk
to
me
o
you
are
wearing
yourself
out
i
must
go
and
ask
pettifer
to
come
and
make
you
have
some
supper
but
this
is
my
mother
you
have
not
seen
her
before
i
think
while
tryan
was
speaking
to
raynor
janet
hurried
out
and
he
seeing
that
this
thoughtfulness
on
his
behalf
would
help
to
counteract
her
depression
was
not
inclined
to
oppose
her
wish
but
accepted
the
supper
pettifer
offered
him
quietly
talking
the
while
about
a
clothing
club
he
was
going
to
establish
in
paddiford
and
the
want
of
provident
habits
among
the
poor
presently
however
raynor
said
she
must
go
home
for
an
hour
to
see
how
her
little
maiden
was
going
on
and
pettifer
left
the
room
with
her
to
take
the
opportunity
of
telling
her
what
had
happened
to
dempster
when
janet
was
left
alone
with
tryan
she
said
feel
so
uncertain
what
to
do
about
my
husband
i
am
so
weak
my
feelings
change
so
from
hour
to
hour
this
morning
when
i
felt
so
hopeful
and
happy
i
thought
i
should
like
to
go
back
to
him
and
try
to
make
up
for
what
has
been
wrong
in
me
i
thought
now
god
would
help
me
and
i
should
have
you
to
teach
and
advise
me
and
i
could
bear
the
troubles
that
would
come
but
since
then
all
this
afternoon
and
evening
i
have
had
the
same
feelings
i
used
to
have
the
same
dread
of
his
anger
and
cruelty
and
it
seems
to
me
as
if
i
should
never
be
able
to
bear
it
without
falling
into
the
same
sins
and
doing
just
what
i
did
before
yet
if
it
were
settled
that
i
should
live
apart
from
him
i
know
it
would
always
be
a
load
on
my
mind
that
i
had
shut
myself
out
from
going
back
to
him
it
seems
a
dreadful
thing
in
life
when
any
one
has
been
so
near
to
one
as
a
husband
for
fifteen
years
to
part
and
be
nothing
to
each
other
any
more
surely
that
is
a
very
strong
tie
and
i
feel
as
if
my
duty
can
never
lie
quite
away
from
it
it
is
very
difficult
to
know
what
to
do
what
ought
i
to
do
think
it
will
be
well
not
to
take
any
decisive
step
yet
wait
until
your
mind
is
calmer
you
might
remain
with
your
mother
for
a
little
while
i
think
you
have
no
real
ground
for
fearing
any
annoyance
from
your
husband
at
present
he
has
put
himself
too
much
in
the
wrong
he
will
very
likely
leave
you
unmolested
for
some
time
dismiss
this
difficult
question
from
your
mind
just
now
if
you
can
every
new
day
may
bring
you
new
grounds
for
decision
and
what
is
most
needful
for
your
health
of
mind
is
repose
from
that
haunting
anxiety
about
the
future
which
has
been
preying
on
you
cast
yourself
on
god
and
trust
that
he
will
direct
you
he
will
make
your
duty
clear
to
you
if
you
wait
submissively
on
him
i
will
wait
a
little
as
you
tell
me
i
will
go
to
my
tomorrow
and
pray
to
be
guided
rightly
you
will
pray
for
me
too
chapter
the
next
morning
janet
was
so
much
calmer
and
at
breakfast
spoke
so
decidedly
of
going
to
her
mother
that
pettifer
and
raynor
agreed
it
would
be
wise
to
let
her
know
by
degrees
what
had
befallen
her
husband
since
as
soon
as
she
went
out
there
would
be
danger
of
her
meeting
some
one
who
would
betray
the
fact
but
raynor
thought
it
would
be
well
first
to
call
at
dempster
and
ascertain
how
he
was
so
she
said
to
janet
dear
i
go
home
first
and
see
to
things
and
get
your
room
ready
you
need
come
yet
you
know
i
shall
be
back
again
in
an
hour
or
so
and
we
can
go
together
no
said
pettifer
with
me
till
evening
i
shall
be
lost
without
you
you
need
go
till
quite
evening
janet
had
dipped
into
the
of
henry
martyn
which
pettifer
had
from
the
paddiford
lending
library
and
her
interest
was
so
arrested
by
that
pathetic
missionary
story
that
she
readily
acquiesced
in
both
propositions
and
raynor
set
out
she
had
been
gone
more
than
an
hour
and
it
was
nearly
twelve
when
janet
put
down
her
book
and
after
sitting
meditatively
for
some
minutes
with
her
eyes
unconsciously
fixed
on
the
opposite
wall
she
rose
went
to
her
bedroom
and
hastily
putting
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
came
down
to
pettifer
who
was
busy
in
the
kitchen
pettifer
she
said
mother
when
she
comes
back
i
gone
to
see
what
has
become
of
those
poor
lakins
in
butchers
lane
i
know
half
starving
and
i
neglected
them
so
lately
and
then
i
think
i
go
on
to
crewe
i
want
to
see
the
dear
little
woman
and
tell
her
myself
about
my
going
to
hear
tryan
she
wo
feel
it
half
so
much
if
i
tell
her
myself
you
wait
till
your
mother
comes
or
put
it
off
till
tomorrow
said
pettifer
alarmed
hardly
be
back
in
time
for
dinner
if
you
get
talking
to
crewe
and
you
have
to
pass
by
your
husband
you
know
and
yesterday
you
were
so
afraid
of
seeing
him
robert
will
be
shut
up
at
the
office
now
if
he
not
gone
out
of
the
town
i
must
go
i
feel
i
must
be
doing
something
for
some
one
not
be
a
mere
useless
log
any
longer
i
been
reading
about
that
wonderful
henry
martyn
he
just
like
tryan
wearing
himself
out
for
other
people
and
i
sit
thinking
of
nothing
but
myself
i
go
i
shall
be
back
soon
she
ran
off
before
pettifer
could
utter
another
word
of
dissuasion
leaving
the
good
woman
in
considerable
anxiety
lest
this
new
impulse
of
janet
should
frustrate
all
precautions
to
save
her
from
a
sudden
shock
janet
having
paid
her
visit
in
butcher
lane
turned
again
into
orchard
street
on
her
way
to
crewe
and
was
thinking
rather
sadly
that
her
mother
economical
housekeeping
would
leave
no
abundant
surplus
to
be
sent
to
the
hungry
lakins
when
she
saw
pilgrim
in
advance
of
her
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
he
was
walking
at
a
rapid
pace
and
when
he
reached
dempster
door
he
turned
and
entered
without
knocking
janet
was
startled
pilgrim
would
never
enter
in
that
way
unless
there
were
some
one
very
ill
in
the
house
it
was
her
husband
she
felt
certain
of
it
at
once
something
had
happened
to
him
without
a
pause
she
ran
across
the
street
opened
the
door
and
entered
there
was
no
one
in
the
passage
the
door
was
wide
open
no
one
was
there
pilgrim
then
was
already
she
rushed
up
at
once
to
dempster
room
her
own
room
the
door
was
open
and
she
paused
in
pale
horror
at
the
sight
before
her
which
seemed
to
stand
out
only
with
the
more
appalling
distinctness
because
the
noonday
light
was
darkened
to
twilight
in
the
chamber
two
strong
nurses
were
using
their
utmost
force
to
hold
dempster
in
bed
while
the
medical
assistant
was
applying
a
sponge
to
his
head
and
pilgrim
was
busy
adjusting
some
apparatus
in
the
background
face
was
purple
and
swollen
his
eyes
dilated
and
fixed
with
a
look
of
dire
terror
on
something
he
seemed
to
see
approaching
him
from
the
iron
closet
he
trembled
violently
and
struggled
as
if
to
jump
out
of
bed
me
go
let
me
go
he
said
in
a
loud
hoarse
whisper
coming
she
cold
she
dead
she
strangle
me
with
her
black
hair
ah
he
shrieked
aloud
hair
is
all
serpents
they
black
serpents
they
hiss
they
hiss
let
me
go
let
me
go
she
wants
to
drag
me
with
her
cold
arms
her
arms
are
serpents
they
are
great
white
serpents
they
twine
round
me
she
wants
to
drag
me
into
the
cold
water
her
bosom
is
cold
it
is
black
it
is
all
serpents
robert
janet
cried
in
tones
of
yearning
pity
rushing
to
the
side
of
the
bed
and
stretching
out
her
arms
towards
him
here
is
janet
she
is
not
dead
she
forgives
you
dempster
maddened
senses
seemed
to
receive
some
new
impression
from
her
appearance
the
terror
gave
way
to
rage
you
sneaking
hypocrite
he
burst
out
in
a
grating
voice
threaten
me
you
mean
to
have
your
revenge
on
me
do
you
do
your
worst
i
got
the
law
on
my
side

the
law

hare

fire
under
you
and
smoke
off
the
whole
pack
of
you
i
sweep
you
up
i
grind

to
powder
small
powder
here
his
voice
dropt
to
a
low
tone
of
shuddering
disgust
powder
on
the
running
about
black
lice
they
are
coming
in
swarms
janet
come
and
take
them
away
curse
you
why
do
you
come
janet
poor
janet
was
kneeling
by
the
bed
with
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
she
almost
wished
her
worst
moment
back
again
rather
than
this
it
seemed
as
if
her
husband
was
already
imprisoned
in
misery
and
she
could
not
reach
him
his
ear
deaf
for
ever
to
the
sounds
of
love
and
forgiveness
his
sins
had
made
a
hard
crust
round
his
soul
her
pitying
voice
could
not
pierce
it
there
is
she
he
went
on
in
a
defiant
tone
do
you
ask
me
where
she
is
i
have
every
drop
of
yellow
blood
out
of
your
veins
if
you
come
questioning
me
your
blood
is
yellow
in
your
purse
running
out
of
your
purse
what

it
into
toads

about
my
head

tongues

the
toads
away
janet
this
last
time
he
uttered
her
name
with
such
a
shriek
of
terror
that
janet
involuntarily
started
up
from
her
knees
and
stood
as
if
petrified
by
the
horrible
vibration
dempster
stared
wildly
in
silence
for
some
months
then
he
spoke
again
in
a
hoarse
whisper
is
she
dead
she
did
it
then
she
buried
herself
in
the
iron
chest
she
left
her
clothes
out
though
she
is
dead
why
do
you
pretend
she
dead
she
coming
she
coming
out
of
the
iron
closet
there
are
the
black
serpents
stop
her
let
me
go
stop
her
she
wants
to
drag
me
away
into
the
cold
black
water
her
bosom
is
black
it
is
all
serpents
they
are
getting
longer
the
great
white
serpents
are
getting
longer
here
pilgrim
came
forward
with
the
apparatus
to
bind
him
but
dempster
struggles
became
more
and
more
violent
ostler
he
shouted
out
the
gig
give
me
the
whip
and
bursting
loose
from
the
strong
hands
that
held
him
he
began
to
flog
the
furiously
with
his
right
arm
along
you
lame
brute
sc
sc
sc
that
it
there
you
go
they
think
they
outwitted
me
do
they
the
sneaking
idiots
i
be
up
with
them
i
make
them
say
the
lord
prayer
backwards
pepper
them
so
that
the
devil
shall
eat
them
raw
sc
sc
sc
we
shall
see
who
be
the
winner
yet
get
along
you
damned
limping
beast
i
lay
your
back
open
i
he
raised
himself
with
a
stronger
effort
than
ever
to
flog
the
and
fell
back
in
convulsions
janet
gave
a
scream
and
sank
on
her
knees
again
she
thought
he
was
dead
as
soon
as
pilgrim
was
able
to
give
her
a
moment
attention
he
came
to
her
and
taking
her
by
the
arm
attempted
to
draw
her
gently
out
of
the
room
my
dear
dempster
let
me
persuade
you
not
to
remain
in
the
room
at
present
we
shall
soon
relieve
these
symptoms
i
hope
it
is
nothing
but
the
delirium
that
ordinarily
attends
such
cases
what
is
the
matter
what
brought
it
on
fell
out
of
the
gig
the
right
leg
is
broken
it
is
a
terrible
accident
and
i
do
disguise
that
there
is
considerable
danger
attending
it
owing
to
the
state
of
the
brain
but
dempster
has
a
strong
constitution
you
know
in
a
few
days
these
symptoms
may
be
allayed
and
he
may
do
well
let
me
beg
of
you
to
keep
out
of
the
room
at
present
you
can
do
no
good
until
dempster
is
better
and
able
to
know
you
but
you
ought
not
to
be
alone
let
me
advise
you
to
have
raynor
with
you
i
will
send
for
mother
but
you
must
not
object
to
my
being
in
the
room
i
shall
be
very
quiet
now
only
just
at
first
the
shock
was
so
great
i
knew
nothing
about
it
i
can
help
the
nurses
a
great
deal
i
can
put
the
cold
things
to
his
head
he
may
be
sensible
for
a
moment
and
know
me
pray
do
not
say
any
more
against
it
my
heart
is
set
on
being
with
him
pilgrim
gave
way
and
janet
having
sent
for
her
mother
and
put
off
her
bonnet
and
shawl
returned
to
take
her
place
by
the
side
of
her
husband
bed
chapter
day
after
day
with
only
short
intervals
of
rest
janet
kept
her
place
in
that
sad
chamber
no
wonder
the
and
the
lazaretto
have
so
often
been
a
refuge
from
the
tossings
of
intellectual
doubt
a
place
of
repose
for
the
worn
and
wounded
spirit
here
is
a
duty
about
which
all
creeds
and
all
philosophies
are
at
one
here
at
least
the
conscience
will
not
be
dogged
by
doubt
the
benign
impulse
will
not
be
checked
by
adverse
theory
here
you
may
begin
to
act
without
settling
one
preliminary
question
to
moisten
the
sufferer
parched
lips
through
the
long
to
bear
up
the
drooping
head
to
lift
the
helpless
limbs
to
divine
the
want
that
can
find
no
utterance
beyond
the
feeble
motion
of
the
hand
or
beseeching
glance
of
the
eye
these
are
offices
that
demand
no
no
casuistry
no
assent
to
propositions
no
weighing
of
consequences
within
the
four
walls
where
the
stir
and
glare
of
the
world
are
shut
out
and
every
voice
is
subdued
where
a
human
being
lies
prostrate
thrown
on
the
tender
mercies
of
his
fellow
the
moral
relation
of
man
to
man
is
reduced
to
its
utmost
clearness
and
simplicity
bigotry
can
not
confuse
it
theory
can
not
pervert
it
passion
awed
into
quiescence
can
neither
pollute
nor
perturb
it
as
we
bend
over
the
all
the
forces
of
our
nature
rush
towards
the
channels
of
pity
of
patience
and
of
love
and
sweep
down
the
miserable
choking
drift
of
our
quarrels
our
debates
our
wisdom
and
our
clamorous
selfish
desires
this
blessing
of
serene
freedom
from
the
importunities
of
opinion
lies
in
all
simple
direct
acts
of
mercy
and
is
one
source
of
that
sweet
calm
which
is
often
felt
by
the
watcher
in
the
even
when
the
duties
there
are
of
a
hard
and
terrible
kind
something
of
that
benign
result
was
felt
by
janet
during
her
tendance
in
her
husband
chamber
when
the
first
hours
were
over
when
her
horror
at
his
delirium
was
no
longer
fresh
she
began
to
be
conscious
of
her
relief
from
the
burden
of
decision
as
to
her
future
course
the
question
that
agitated
her
about
returning
to
her
husband
had
been
solved
in
a
moment
and
this
illness
after
all
might
be
the
herald
of
another
blessing
just
as
that
dreadful
midnight
when
she
stood
an
outcast
in
cold
and
darkness
had
been
followed
by
the
dawn
of
a
new
hope
robert
would
get
better
this
illness
might
alter
him
he
would
be
a
long
time
feeble
needing
help
walking
with
a
crutch
perhaps
she
would
wait
on
him
with
such
tenderness
such
love
that
the
old
harshness
and
cruelty
must
melt
away
for
ever
under
the
she
would
pour
around
him
her
bosom
heaved
at
the
thought
and
delicious
tears
fell
janet
was
a
nature
in
which
hatred
and
revenge
could
find
no
place
the
long
bitter
years
drew
half
their
bitterness
from
her
remembrance
of
the
too
short
years
of
love
that
went
before
and
the
thought
that
her
husband
would
ever
put
her
hand
to
his
lips
again
and
recall
the
days
when
they
sat
on
the
grass
together
and
he
laid
scarlet
poppies
on
her
black
hair
and
called
her
his
gypsy
queen
seemed
to
send
a
tide
of
loving
oblivion
over
all
the
harsh
and
stony
space
they
had
traversed
since
the
divine
love
that
had
already
shone
upon
her
would
be
with
her
she
would
lift
up
her
soul
continually
for
help
tryan
she
knew
would
pray
for
her
if
she
felt
herself
failing
she
would
confess
it
to
him
at
once
if
her
feet
began
to
slip
there
was
that
stay
for
her
to
cling
to
o
she
could
never
be
drawn
back
into
that
cold
damp
vault
of
sin
and
despair
again
she
had
felt
the
morning
sun
she
had
tasted
the
sweet
pure
air
of
trust
and
penitence
and
submission
these
were
the
thoughts
passing
through
janet
mind
as
she
hovered
about
her
husband
bed
and
these
were
the
hopes
she
poured
out
to
tryan
when
he
called
to
see
her
it
was
so
evident
that
they
were
strengthening
her
in
her
new
struggle
they
shed
such
a
glow
of
calm
enthusiasm
over
her
face
as
she
spoke
of
them
that
tryan
could
not
bear
to
throw
on
them
the
chill
of
premonitory
doubts
though
a
previous
conversation
he
had
had
with
pilgrim
had
convinced
him
that
there
was
not
the
faintest
probability
of
dempster
recovery
poor
janet
did
not
know
the
significance
of
the
changing
symptoms
and
when
after
the
lapse
of
a
week
the
delirium
began
to
lose
some
of
its
violence
and
to
be
interrupted
by
longer
and
longer
intervals
of
stupor
she
tried
to
think
that
these
might
be
steps
on
the
way
to
recovery
and
she
shrank
from
questioning
pilgrim
lest
he
should
confirm
the
fears
that
began
to
get
predominance
in
her
mind
but
before
many
days
were
past
he
thought
it
right
not
to
allow
her
to
blind
herself
any
longer
one
day
it
was
just
about
noon
when
bad
news
always
seems
most
sickening
he
led
her
from
her
husband
chamber
into
the
opposite
where
raynor
was
sitting
and
said
to
her
in
that
low
tone
of
sympathetic
feeling
which
sometimes
gave
a
sudden
air
of
gentleness
to
this
rough
man
dear
dempster
it
is
right
in
these
cases
you
know
to
be
prepared
for
the
worst
i
think
i
shall
be
saving
you
pain
by
preventing
you
from
entertaining
any
false
hopes
and
dempster
state
is
now
such
that
i
fear
we
must
consider
recovery
impossible
the
affection
of
the
brain
might
not
have
been
hopeless
but
you
see
there
is
a
terrible
complication
and
i
am
grieved
to
say
the
broken
limb
is
mortifying
janet
listened
with
a
sinking
heart
that
future
of
love
and
forgiveness
would
never
come
then
he
was
going
out
of
her
sight
for
ever
where
her
pity
could
never
reach
him
she
turned
cold
and
trembled
do
you
think
he
will
die
she
said
ever
coming
to
himself
without
ever
knowing
me
can
not
say
that
with
certainty
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
cerebral
oppression
may
subside
and
that
he
may
become
conscious
if
there
is
anything
you
would
wish
to
be
said
or
done
in
that
case
it
would
be
well
to
be
prepared
i
should
think
pilgrim
continued
turning
to
raynor
dempster
affairs
are
likely
to
be
in
order
his
will
is
i
would
have
him
troubled
about
those
things
interrupted
janet
has
no
relations
but
quite
distant
ones
no
one
but
me
i
take
up
the
time
with
that
i
only
want
to
she
was
unable
to
finish
she
felt
her
sobs
rising
and
left
the
room
god
she
said
inwardly
not
thy
love
greater
than
mine
have
mercy
on
him
have
mercy
on
him
this
happened
on
wednesday
ten
days
after
the
fatal
accident
by
the
following
sunday
dempster
was
in
a
state
of
rapidly
increasing
prostration
and
when
pilgrim
who
in
turn
with
his
assistant
had
slept
in
the
house
from
the
beginning
came
in
about
ten
as
usual
he
scarcely
believed
that
the
feebly
struggling
life
would
last
out
till
morning
for
the
last
few
days
he
had
been
administering
stimulants
to
relieve
the
exhaustion
which
had
succeeded
the
alternations
of
delirium
and
stupor
this
slight
office
was
all
that
now
remained
to
be
done
for
the
patient
so
at
eleven
pilgrim
went
to
bed
having
given
directions
to
the
nurse
and
desired
her
to
call
him
if
any
change
took
place
or
if
dempster
desired
his
presence
janet
could
not
be
persuaded
to
leave
the
room
she
was
yearning
and
watching
for
a
moment
in
which
her
husband
eyes
would
rest
consciously
upon
her
and
he
would
know
that
she
had
forgiven
him
how
changed
he
was
since
that
terrible
monday
nearly
a
fortnight
ago
he
lay
motionless
but
for
the
irregular
breathing
that
stirred
his
broad
chest
and
thick
muscular
neck
his
features
were
no
longer
purple
and
swollen
they
were
pale
sunken
and
haggard
a
cold
perspiration
stood
in
beads
on
the
protuberant
forehead
and
on
the
wasted
hands
stretched
motionless
on
the
it
was
better
to
see
the
hands
so
than
convulsively
picking
the
air
as
they
had
been
a
week
ago
janet
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
through
the
long
hours
of
watching
the
unconscious
eyes
wiping
the
perspiration
from
the
brow
and
cheeks
and
keeping
her
left
hand
on
the
cold
unanswering
right
hand
that
lay
beside
her
on
the
she
was
almost
as
pale
as
her
dying
husband
and
there
were
dark
lines
under
her
eyes
for
this
was
the
third
night
since
she
had
taken
off
her
clothes
but
the
eager
straining
gaze
of
her
dark
eyes
and
the
acute
sensibility
that
lay
in
every
line
about
her
mouth
made
a
strange
contrast
with
the
blank
unconsciousness
and
emaciated
animalism
of
the
face
she
was
watching
there
was
profound
stillness
in
the
house
she
heard
no
sound
but
her
husband
breathing
and
the
ticking
of
the
watch
on
the
mantelpiece
the
candle
placed
high
up
shed
a
soft
light
down
on
the
one
object
she
cared
to
see
there
was
a
smell
of
brandy
in
the
room
it
was
given
to
her
husband
from
time
to
time
but
this
smell
which
at
first
had
produced
in
her
a
faint
shuddering
sensation
was
now
becoming
indifferent
to
her
she
did
not
even
perceive
it
she
was
too
unconscious
of
herself
to
feel
either
temptations
or
accusations
she
only
felt
that
the
husband
of
her
youth
was
dying
far
far
out
of
her
reach
as
if
she
were
standing
helpless
on
the
shore
while
he
was
sinking
in
the
black
she
only
yearned
for
one
moment
in
which
she
might
satisfy
the
deep
forgiving
pity
of
her
soul
by
one
look
of
love
one
word
of
tenderness
her
sensations
and
thoughts
were
so
persistent
that
she
could
not
measure
the
hours
and
it
was
a
surprise
to
her
when
the
nurse
put
out
the
candle
and
let
in
the
faint
morning
light
raynor
anxious
about
janet
was
already
up
and
now
brought
in
some
fresh
coffee
for
her
and
pilgrim
having
awaked
had
hurried
on
his
clothes
and
was
coming
in
to
see
how
dempster
was
this
change
from
to
morning
this
recommencement
of
the
same
round
of
things
that
had
happened
yesterday
was
a
discouragement
rather
than
a
relief
to
janet
she
was
more
conscious
of
her
chill
weariness
the
new
light
thrown
on
her
husband
face
seemed
to
reveal
the
still
work
that
death
had
been
doing
through
the
night
she
felt
her
last
lingering
hope
that
he
would
ever
know
her
again
forsake
her
but
now
pilgrim
having
felt
the
pulse
was
putting
some
brandy
in
a
between
dempster
lips
the
brandy
went
down
and
his
breathing
became
freer
janet
noticed
the
change
and
her
heart
beat
faster
as
she
leaned
forward
to
watch
him
suddenly
a
slight
movement
like
the
passing
away
of
a
shadow
was
visible
in
his
face
and
he
opened
his
eyes
full
on
janet
it
was
almost
like
meeting
him
again
on
the
resurrection
morning
after
the
night
of
the
grave
do
you
know
me
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
and
there
was
a
faintly
perceptible
motion
of
the
lips
as
if
he
wanted
to
speak
but
the
moment
of
speech
was
for
ever
gone
the
moment
for
asking
pardon
of
her
if
he
wanted
to
ask
it
could
he
read
the
full
forgiveness
that
was
written
in
her
eyes
she
never
knew
for
as
she
was
bending
to
kiss
him
the
thick
veil
of
death
fell
between
them
and
her
lips
touched
a
corpse
chapter
the
faces
looked
very
hard
and
unmoved
that
surrounded
dempster
grave
while
old
crewe
read
the
in
his
low
broken
voice
the
were
such
men
as
pittman
lowme
and
budd
men
whom
dempster
had
called
his
friends
while
he
was
in
life
and
worldly
faces
never
look
so
worldly
as
at
a
funeral
they
have
the
same
effect
of
grating
incongruity
as
the
sound
of
a
coarse
voice
breaking
the
solemn
silence
of
night
the
one
face
that
had
sorrow
in
it
was
covered
by
a
thick
and
the
sorrow
was
suppressed
and
silent
no
one
knew
how
deep
it
was
for
the
thought
in
most
of
her
neighbours
minds
was
that
dempster
could
hardly
have
had
better
fortune
than
to
lose
a
bad
husband
who
had
left
her
the
compensation
of
a
good
income
they
found
it
difficult
to
conceive
that
her
husband
death
could
be
felt
by
her
otherwise
than
as
a
deliverance
the
person
who
was
most
thoroughly
convinced
that
grief
was
deep
and
real
was
pilgrim
who
in
general
was
not
at
all
weakly
given
to
a
belief
in
disinterested
feeling
woman
has
a
tender
heart
he
was
frequently
heard
to
observe
in
his
morning
rounds
about
this
time
used
to
think
there
was
a
great
deal
of
palaver
in
her
but
you
may
depend
upon
it
there
no
pretence
about
her
if
he
been
the
kindest
husband
in
the
world
she
have
felt
more
there
a
great
deal
of
good
in
dempster
a
great
deal
of
good
always
said
so
was
lowme
reply
when
he
made
the
observation
to
her
was
always
so
very
full
of
pretty
attentions
to
me
when
i
was
ill
but
they
tell
me
now
she
turned
tryanite
if
it
we
sha
agree
again
it
very
inconsistent
in
her
i
think
turning
round
in
that
way
after
being
the
foremost
to
laugh
at
the
tryanite
cant
and
especially
in
a
woman
of
her
habits
she
should
cure
herself
of
them
before
she
pretends
to
be
i
think
she
means
to
cure
herself
do
you
know
said
pilgrim
whose
goodwill
towards
janet
was
just
now
quite
above
that
temperate
point
at
which
he
could
indulge
his
feminine
patients
with
a
little
judicious
detraction
feel
sure
she
has
not
taken
any
stimulants
all
through
her
husband
illness
and
she
has
been
constantly
in
the
way
of
them
i
can
see
she
sometimes
suffers
a
good
deal
of
depression
for
want
of
them
it
shows
all
the
more
resolution
in
her
those
cures
are
rare
but
i
known
them
happen
sometimes
with
people
of
strong
will
lowme
took
an
opportunity
of
retailing
pilgrim
conversation
to
phipps
who
as
a
victim
of
pratt
and
plethora
could
rarely
enjoy
that
pleasure
at
phipps
was
a
woman
of
decided
opinions
though
of
wheezy
utterance
my
part
she
remarked
glad
to
hear
there
any
likelihood
of
improvement
in
dempster
but
i
think
the
way
things
have
turned
out
seems
to
show
that
she
was
more
to
blame
than
people
thought
she
was
else
why
should
she
feel
so
much
about
her
husband
and
dempster
i
understand
has
left
his
wife
pretty
nearly
all
his
property
to
do
as
she
likes
with
is
behaving
like
such
a
very
bad
husband
i
believe
dempster
can
have
had
so
much
provocation
as
they
pretended
i
known
husbands
who
laid
plans
for
tormenting
their
wives
when
they
underground
tying
up
their
money
and
hindering
them
from
marrying
again
not
that
should
ever
wish
to
marry
again
i
think
one
husband
in
one
life
is
enough
in
all
conscience
here
she
threw
a
fierce
glance
at
the
amiable
phipps
who
was
innocently
delighting
himself
with
the
in
the
guardian
and
thinking
the
editor
must
be
a
droll
fellow
it
aggravating
to
be
tied
up
in
that
way
why
they
say
dempster
will
have
as
good
as
six
hundred
at
least
a
fine
thing
for
her
that
was
a
poor
girl
without
a
farthing
to
her
fortune
it
well
if
she
does
make
ducks
and
drakes
of
it
somehow
phipps
view
of
janet
however
was
far
from
being
the
prevalent
one
in
milby
even
neighbours
who
had
no
strong
personal
interest
in
her
could
hardly
see
the
woman
in
her
widow
dress
with
a
sad
sweet
gravity
in
her
face
and
not
be
touched
with
fresh
admiration
for
her
and
not
feel
at
least
vaguely
that
she
had
entered
on
a
new
life
in
which
it
was
a
sort
of
desecration
to
allude
to
the
painful
past
and
the
old
friends
who
had
a
real
regard
for
her
but
whose
cordiality
had
been
repelled
or
chilled
of
late
years
now
came
round
her
with
hearty
demonstrations
of
affection
jerome
felt
that
his
happiness
had
a
substantial
addition
now
he
could
once
more
call
on
that
little
woman
dempster
and
think
of
her
with
rejoicing
instead
of
sorrow
the
pratts
lost
no
time
in
returning
to
the
footing
of
friendship
with
janet
and
her
mother
and
miss
pratt
felt
it
incumbent
on
her
on
all
suitable
occasions
to
deliver
a
very
emphatic
approval
of
the
remarkable
strength
of
mind
she
understood
dempster
to
be
exhibiting
the
miss
linnets
were
eager
to
meet
tryan
wishes
by
greeting
janet
as
one
who
was
likely
to
be
a
sister
in
religious
feeling
and
good
works
and
linnet
was
so
agreeably
surprised
by
the
fact
that
dempster
had
left
his
wife
the
money
that
handsome
way
to
do
what
she
liked
with
it
that
she
even
included
dempster
himself
and
his
villanous
discovery
of
the
flaw
in
her
title
to
pye
croft
in
her
magnanimous
oblivion
of
past
offences
she
and
jerome
agreed
over
a
friendly
cup
of
tea
that
there
were
many
husbands
as
was
very
fine
spoken
an
all
that
an
yet
all
the
while
kep
a
will
locked
up
from
you
as
tied
you
up
as
tight
as
anything
i
assure
jerome
continued
dropping
her
voice
in
a
confidential
manner
know
no
more
to
this
day
about
jerome
will
nor
the
child
as
is
unborn
i
no
fears
about
a
income
i
well
aware
jerome
niver
leave
me
stret
for
that
but
i
should
like
to
hev
a
thousand
or
two
at
my
own
disposial
it
makes
a
widow
a
deal
more
looked
on
perhaps
this
ground
of
respect
to
widows
might
not
be
entirely
without
its
influence
on
the
milby
mind
and
might
do
something
towards
conciliating
those
more
aristocratic
acquaintances
of
janet
who
would
otherwise
have
been
inclined
to
take
the
severest
view
of
her
apostasy
towards
evangelicalism
errors
look
so
very
ugly
in
persons
of
small
means
one
feels
they
are
taking
quite
a
liberty
in
going
astray
whereas
people
of
fortune
may
naturally
indulge
in
a
few
delinquencies
got
the
money
for
it
as
the
girl
said
of
her
mistress
who
had
made
herself
ill
with
pickled
salmon
however
it
may
have
been
there
was
not
an
acquaintance
of
janet
in
milby
that
did
not
offer
her
civilities
in
the
early
days
of
her
widowhood
even
the
severe
phipps
was
not
an
exception
for
heaven
knows
what
would
become
of
our
sociality
if
we
never
visited
people
we
speak
ill
of
we
should
live
like
egyptian
hermits
in
crowded
solitude
perhaps
the
attentions
most
grateful
to
janet
were
those
of
her
old
friend
crewe
whose
attachment
to
her
favourite
proved
quite
too
strong
for
any
resentment
she
might
be
supposed
to
feel
on
the
score
of
tryan
the
little
deaf
old
lady
could
do
without
her
accustomed
visitor
whom
she
had
seen
grow
up
from
child
to
woman
always
so
willing
to
chat
with
her
and
tell
her
all
the
news
though
she
deaf
while
other
people
thought
it
tiresome
to
shout
in
her
ear
and
irritated
her
by
recommending
of
various
construction
all
this
friendliness
was
very
precious
to
janet
she
was
conscious
of
the
aid
it
gave
her
in
the
which
was
the
blessing
she
prayed
for
with
every
fresh
morning
the
chief
strength
of
her
nature
lay
in
her
affection
which
coloured
all
the
rest
of
her
mind
it
gave
a
personal
sisterly
tenderness
to
her
acts
of
benevolence
it
made
her
cling
with
tenacity
to
every
object
that
had
once
stirred
her
kindly
emotions
alas
it
was
unsatisfied
wounded
affection
that
had
made
her
trouble
greater
than
she
could
bear
and
now
there
was
no
check
to
the
full
flow
of
that
plenteous
current
in
her
nature
no
gnawing
secret
anguish
no
overhanging
terror
no
inward
shame
friendly
faces
beamed
on
her
she
felt
that
friendly
hearts
were
approving
her
and
wishing
her
well
and
that
mild
sunshine
of
goodwill
fell
beneficently
on
her
new
hopes
and
efforts
as
the
clear
shining
after
rain
falls
on
the
tender
of
spring
and
wins
them
from
promise
to
fulfilment
and
she
needed
these
secondary
helps
for
her
wrestling
with
her
past
self
was
not
always
easy
the
strong
emotions
from
which
the
life
of
a
human
being
receives
a
new
bias
win
their
victory
as
the
sea
wins
his
though
their
advance
may
be
sure
they
will
often
after
a
mightier
wave
than
usual
seem
to
roll
back
so
far
as
to
lose
all
the
ground
they
had
made
janet
showed
the
strong
bent
of
her
will
by
taking
every
outward
precaution
against
the
occurrence
of
a
temptation
her
mother
was
now
her
constant
companion
having
shut
up
her
little
dwelling
and
come
to
reside
in
orchard
street
and
janet
gave
all
dangerous
keys
into
her
keeping
entreating
her
to
lock
them
away
in
some
secret
place
whenever
the
too
depression
and
craving
threatened
her
she
would
seek
a
refuge
in
what
had
always
been
her
purest
enjoyment
in
visiting
one
of
her
poor
neighbours
in
carrying
some
food
or
comfort
to
a
in
cheering
with
her
smile
some
of
the
familiar
dwellings
up
the
dingy
but
the
great
source
of
courage
the
great
help
to
perseverance
was
the
sense
that
she
had
a
friend
and
teacher
in
tryan
she
could
confess
her
difficulties
to
him
she
knew
he
prayed
for
her
she
had
always
before
her
the
prospect
of
soon
seeing
him
and
hearing
words
of
admonition
and
comfort
that
came
to
her
charged
with
a
divine
power
such
as
she
had
never
found
in
human
words
before
so
the
time
passed
till
it
was
far
on
in
may
nearly
a
month
after
her
husband
death
when
as
she
and
her
mother
were
seated
peacefully
at
breakfast
in
the
looking
through
the
open
window
at
the
garden
where
the
was
now
whitened
with
a
letter
was
brought
in
for
raynor
there
the
thurston
on
it
she
said
must
be
about
your
aunt
anna
ah
so
it
is
poor
thing
she
been
taken
worse
this
last
day
or
two
and
has
asked
them
to
send
for
me
that
dropsy
is
carrying
her
off
at
last
i
daresay
poor
thing
it
will
be
a
happy
release
i
must
go
my
dear
she
your
father
last
sister
though
i
am
sorry
to
leave
you
however
perhaps
i
shall
not
have
to
stay
more
than
a
night
or
two
janet
looked
distressed
as
she
said
you
must
go
mother
but
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
without
you
i
think
i
shall
run
in
to
pettifer
and
ask
her
to
come
and
stay
with
me
while
you
away
sure
she
will
at
twelve
janet
having
seen
her
mother
in
the
coach
that
was
to
carry
her
to
thurston
called
on
her
way
back
at
pettifer
but
found
to
her
great
disappointment
that
her
old
friend
was
gone
out
for
the
day
so
she
wrote
on
a
leaf
of
her
an
urgent
request
that
pettifer
would
come
and
stay
with
her
while
her
mother
was
away
and
desiring
the
to
give
it
to
her
mistress
as
soon
as
she
came
home
walked
on
to
the
vicarage
to
sit
with
crewe
thinking
to
relieve
in
this
way
the
feeling
of
desolateness
and
undefined
fear
that
was
taking
possession
of
her
on
being
left
alone
for
the
first
time
since
that
great
crisis
in
her
life
and
crewe
too
was
not
at
home
janet
with
a
sense
of
discouragement
for
which
she
rebuked
herself
as
childish
walked
sadly
home
again
and
when
she
entered
the
vacant
she
could
not
help
bursting
into
tears
it
is
such
vague
undefinable
states
of
susceptibility
as
this
states
of
excitement
or
depression
half
mental
half
physical
that
determine
many
a
tragedy
in
women
lives
janet
could
scarcely
eat
anything
at
her
solitary
dinner
she
tried
to
fix
her
attention
on
a
book
in
vain
she
walked
about
the
garden
and
felt
the
very
sunshine
melancholy
between
four
and
five
old
pittman
called
and
joined
her
in
the
garden
where
she
had
been
sitting
for
some
time
under
one
of
the
great
thinking
how
robert
in
his
best
moods
used
to
take
little
mamsey
to
look
at
the
cucumbers
or
to
see
the
alderney
cow
with
its
calf
in
the
paddock
the
tears
and
sobs
had
come
again
at
these
thoughts
and
when
pittman
approached
her
she
was
feeling
languid
and
exhausted
but
the
old
gentleman
sight
and
sensibility
were
obtuse
and
to
janet
satisfaction
he
showed
no
consciousness
that
she
was
in
grief
have
a
task
to
impose
upon
you
dempster
he
said
with
a
certain
toothless
pomposity
habitual
to
him
want
you
to
look
over
those
letters
again
in
dempster
bureau
and
see
if
you
can
find
one
from
poole
about
the
mortgage
on
those
houses
at
dingley
it
will
be
worth
twenty
pounds
if
you
can
find
it
and
i
do
know
where
it
can
be
if
it
is
among
those
letters
in
the
bureau
i
looked
everywhere
at
the
office
for
it
i
going
home
now
but
i
call
again
tomorrow
if
you
be
good
enough
to
look
in
the
meantime
janet
said
she
would
look
directly
and
turned
with
pittman
into
the
house
but
the
search
would
take
her
some
time
so
he
bade
her
and
she
went
at
once
to
a
bureau
which
stood
in
a
small
where
dempster
used
sometimes
to
write
letters
and
receive
people
who
came
on
business
out
of
office
hours
she
had
looked
through
the
contents
of
the
bureau
more
than
once
but
today
on
removing
the
last
bundle
of
letters
from
one
of
the
compartments
she
saw
what
she
had
never
seen
before
a
small
nick
in
the
wood
made
in
the
shape
of
a
evidently
intended
as
a
means
of
pushing
aside
the
movable
back
of
the
compartment
in
her
examination
hitherto
she
had
not
found
such
a
letter
as
pittman
had
described
perhaps
there
might
be
more
letters
behind
this
slide
she
pushed
it
back
at
once
and
saw
no
letters
but
a
small
half
full
of
pale
brandy
dempster
habitual
drink
an
impetuous
desire
shook
janet
through
all
her
members
it
seemed
to
master
her
with
the
inevitable
force
of
strong
fumes
that
flood
our
senses
before
we
are
aware
her
hand
was
on
the
decanter
pale
and
excited
she
was
lifting
it
out
of
its
niche
when
with
a
start
and
a
shudder
she
dashed
it
to
the
ground
and
the
room
was
filled
with
the
odour
of
the
spirit
without
staying
to
shut
up
the
bureau
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
snatched
up
her
bonnet
and
mantle
which
lay
in
the
and
hurried
out
of
the
house
where
should
she
go
in
what
place
would
this
demon
that
had
her
be
scared
back
again
she
walks
rapidly
along
the
street
in
the
direction
of
the
church
she
is
soon
at
the
gate
of
the
churchyard
she
passes
through
it
and
makes
her
way
across
the
graves
to
a
spot
she
knows
a
spot
where
the
turf
was
stirred
not
long
ago
where
a
tomb
is
to
be
erected
soon
it
is
very
near
the
church
wall
on
the
side
which
now
lies
in
deep
shadow
quite
shut
out
from
the
rays
of
the
westering
sun
by
a
projecting
buttress
janet
sat
down
on
the
ground
it
was
a
sombre
spot
a
thick
hedge
surmounted
by
was
in
front
of
her
a
projecting
buttress
on
each
side
but
she
wanted
to
shut
out
even
these
objects
her
thick
crape
veil
was
down
but
she
closed
her
eyes
behind
it
and
pressed
her
hands
upon
them
she
wanted
to
summon
up
the
vision
of
the
past
she
wanted
to
lash
the
demon
out
of
her
soul
with
the
stinging
memories
of
the
bygone
misery
she
wanted
to
renew
the
old
horror
and
the
old
anguish
that
she
might
throw
herself
with
the
more
desperate
clinging
energy
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
where
the
divine
sufferer
would
impart
divine
strength
she
tried
to
recall
those
first
bitter
moments
of
shame
which
were
like
the
shuddering
discovery
of
the
leper
that
the
dire
taint
is
upon
him
the
deeper
and
deeper
lapse
the
of
settled
despair
the
awful
moments
by
the
bedside
of
her
husband
and
then
she
tried
to
live
through
with
a
remembrance
made
more
vivid
by
that
contrast
the
blessed
hours
of
hope
and
joy
and
peace
that
had
come
to
her
of
late
since
her
whole
soul
had
been
bent
towards
the
attainment
of
purity
and
holiness
but
now
when
the
paroxysm
of
temptation
was
past
dread
and
despondency
began
to
thrust
themselves
like
cold
heavy
mists
between
her
and
the
heaven
to
which
she
wanted
to
look
for
light
and
guidance
the
temptation
would
come
again
that
rush
of
desire
might
overmaster
her
the
next
time
she
would
slip
back
again
into
that
deep
slimy
pit
from
which
she
had
been
once
rescued
and
there
might
be
no
deliverance
for
her
more
her
prayers
did
not
help
her
for
fear
predominated
over
trust
she
had
no
confidence
that
the
aid
she
sought
would
be
given
the
idea
of
her
future
fall
had
grasped
her
mind
too
strongly
alone
in
this
way
she
was
powerless
if
she
could
see
tryan
if
she
could
confess
all
to
him
she
might
gather
hope
again
she
see
him
she
must
go
to
him
janet
rose
from
the
ground
and
walked
away
with
a
quick
resolved
step
she
had
been
seated
there
a
long
while
and
the
sun
had
already
sunk
it
was
late
for
her
to
walk
to
paddiford
and
go
to
tryan
where
she
had
never
called
before
but
there
was
no
other
way
of
seeing
him
that
evening
and
she
could
not
hesitate
about
it
she
walked
towards
a
footpath
through
the
fields
which
would
take
her
to
paddiford
without
obliging
her
to
go
through
the
town
the
way
was
rather
long
but
she
preferred
it
because
it
left
less
probability
of
her
meeting
acquaintances
and
she
shrank
from
having
to
speak
to
any
one
the
evening
red
had
nearly
faded
by
the
time
janet
knocked
at
wagstaff
door
the
good
woman
looked
surprised
to
see
her
at
that
hour
but
janet
mourning
weeds
and
the
painful
agitation
of
her
face
quickly
brought
the
second
thought
that
some
urgent
trouble
had
sent
her
there
tryan
just
come
in
she
said
you
step
into
the
parlour
i
go
up
and
tell
him
you
here
he
seemed
very
tired
and
poorly
at
another
time
janet
would
have
felt
distress
at
the
idea
that
she
was
disturbing
tryan
when
he
required
rest
but
now
her
need
was
too
great
for
that
she
could
feel
nothing
but
a
sense
of
coming
relief
when
she
heard
his
step
on
the
stair
and
saw
him
enter
the
room
he
went
towards
her
with
a
look
of
anxiety
and
said
fear
something
is
the
matter
i
fear
you
are
in
trouble
then
poor
janet
poured
forth
her
sad
tale
of
temptation
and
despondency
and
even
while
she
was
confessing
she
felt
half
her
burden
removed
the
act
of
confiding
in
human
sympathy
the
consciousness
that
a
was
listening
to
her
with
patient
pity
prepared
her
soul
for
that
stronger
leap
by
which
faith
grasps
the
idea
of
the
divine
sympathy
when
tryan
spoke
words
of
consolation
and
encouragement
she
could
now
believe
the
message
of
mercy
the
that
had
threatened
to
overwhelm
her
rolled
back
again
and
life
once
more
spread
its
space
before
her
she
had
been
unable
to
pray
alone
but
now
his
prayer
bore
her
own
soul
along
with
it
as
the
broad
tongue
of
flame
carries
upwards
in
its
vigorous
leap
the
little
flickering
fire
that
could
hardly
keep
alight
by
itself
but
tryan
was
anxious
that
janet
should
not
linger
out
at
this
late
hour
when
he
saw
that
she
was
calmed
he
said
will
walk
home
with
you
now
we
can
talk
on
the
way
but
janet
mind
was
now
sufficiently
at
liberty
for
her
to
notice
the
signs
of
feverish
weariness
in
his
appearance
and
she
would
not
hear
of
causing
him
any
further
fatigue
no
she
said
earnestly
will
pain
me
very
much
indeed
you
will
by
going
out
again
on
my
account
there
is
no
real
reason
why
i
should
not
go
alone
and
when
he
persisted
fearing
that
for
her
to
be
seen
out
so
late
alone
might
excite
remark
she
said
imploringly
with
a
half
sob
in
her
voice
should
i
what
would
others
like
me
do
if
you
went
from
us
will
you
not
think
more
of
that
and
take
care
of
yourself
he
had
often
had
that
appeal
made
to
him
before
but
tonight
from
janet
lips
it
seemed
to
have
a
new
force
for
him
and
he
gave
way
at
first
indeed
he
only
did
so
on
condition
that
she
would
let
wagstaff
go
with
her
but
janet
had
determined
to
walk
home
alone
she
preferred
solitude
she
wished
not
to
have
her
present
feelings
distracted
by
any
conversation
so
she
went
out
into
the
dewy
starlight
and
as
tryan
turned
away
from
her
he
felt
a
stronger
wish
than
ever
that
his
fragile
life
might
last
out
for
him
to
see
janet
restoration
thoroughly
established
to
see
her
no
longer
fleeing
struggling
clinging
up
the
steep
sides
of
a
precipice
whence
she
might
be
any
moment
hurled
back
into
the
depths
of
despair
but
walking
firmly
on
the
level
ground
of
habit
he
inwardly
resolved
that
nothing
but
a
peremptory
duty
should
ever
take
him
from
milby
that
he
would
not
cease
to
watch
over
her
until
life
forsook
him
janet
walked
on
quickly
till
she
turned
into
the
fields
then
she
slackened
her
pace
a
little
enjoying
the
sense
of
solitude
which
a
few
hours
before
had
been
intolerable
to
her
the
divine
presence
did
not
now
seem
far
off
where
she
had
not
wings
to
reach
it
prayer
itself
seemed
superfluous
in
those
moments
of
calm
trust
the
temptation
which
had
so
lately
made
her
shudder
before
the
possibilities
of
the
future
was
now
a
source
of
confidence
for
had
she
not
been
delivered
from
it
had
not
rescue
come
in
the
extremity
of
danger
yes
infinite
love
was
caring
for
her
she
felt
like
a
little
child
whose
hand
is
firmly
grasped
by
its
father
as
its
frail
limbs
make
their
way
over
the
rough
ground
if
it
should
stumble
the
father
will
not
let
it
go
that
walk
in
the
dewy
starlight
remained
for
ever
in
janet
memory
as
one
of
those
baptismal
epochs
when
the
soul
dipped
in
the
sacred
waters
of
joy
and
peace
rises
from
them
with
new
energies
with
more
unalterable
longings
when
she
reached
home
she
found
pettifer
there
anxious
for
her
return
after
thanking
her
for
coming
janet
only
said
have
been
to
tryan
i
wanted
to
speak
to
him
and
then
remembering
how
she
had
left
the
bureau
and
papers
she
went
into
the
where
apparently
no
one
had
been
since
she
quitted
it
for
there
lay
the
fragments
of
glass
and
the
room
was
still
full
of
the
hateful
odour
how
feeble
and
miserable
the
temptation
seemed
to
her
at
this
moment
she
rang
for
kitty
to
come
and
pick
up
the
fragments
and
rub
the
floor
while
she
herself
replaced
the
papers
and
locked
up
the
bureau
the
next
morning
when
seated
at
breakfast
with
pettifer
janet
said
a
dreary
place
that
is
where
tryan
lives
i
sure
it
must
be
very
bad
for
him
to
live
there
do
you
know
all
this
morning
since
i
been
awake
i
been
turning
over
a
little
plan
in
my
mind
i
think
it
a
charming
one
all
the
more
because
you
are
concerned
in
it
what
can
that
be
know
that
house
on
the
redhill
road
they
call
holly
mount
it
is
shut
up
now
that
is
robert
house
at
least
it
is
mine
now
and
it
stands
on
one
of
the
healthiest
spots
about
here
now
i
been
settling
in
my
own
mind
that
if
a
dear
good
woman
of
my
acquaintance
who
knows
how
to
make
a
home
as
comfortable
and
cosy
as
a
bird
nest
were
to
take
up
her
abode
there
and
have
tryan
as
a
lodger
she
would
be
doing
one
of
the
most
useful
deeds
in
all
her
useful
life
such
a
way
of
wrapping
up
things
in
pretty
words
you
must
speak
plainer
plain
words
then
i
should
like
to
settle
you
at
holly
mount
you
would
not
have
to
pay
any
more
rent
than
where
you
are
and
it
would
be
twenty
times
pleasanter
for
you
than
living
up
that
passage
where
you
see
nothing
but
a
brick
wall
and
then
as
it
is
not
far
from
paddiford
i
think
tryan
might
be
persuaded
to
lodge
with
you
instead
of
in
that
musty
house
among
dead
cabbages
and
smoky
cottages
i
know
you
would
like
to
have
him
live
with
you
and
you
would
be
such
a
mother
to
him
be
sure
i
should
like
it
it
would
be
the
finest
thing
in
the
world
for
me
but
there
be
furniture
wanted
my
little
bit
of
furniture
wo
fill
that
house
i
can
put
some
in
out
of
this
house
it
is
too
full
and
we
can
buy
the
rest
they
tell
me
i
to
have
more
money
than
i
shall
know
what
to
do
with
almost
afraid
said
pettifer
doubtfully
tryan
will
hardly
be
persuaded
he
been
talked
to
so
much
about
leaving
that
place
and
he
always
said
he
must
stay
there
he
must
be
among
the
people
and
there
was
no
other
place
for
him
in
paddiford
it
cuts
me
to
the
heart
to
see
him
getting
thinner
and
thinner
and
i
noticed
him
quite
short
o
breath
sometimes
linnet
will
have
it
wagstaff
half
poisons
him
with
bad
cooking
i
do
know
about
that
but
he
have
many
comforts
i
expect
he
break
down
all
of
a
sudden
some
day
and
never
be
able
to
preach
any
more
i
shall
try
my
skill
with
him
by
and
by
i
shall
be
very
cunning
and
say
nothing
to
him
till
all
is
ready
you
and
i
and
mother
when
she
comes
home
will
set
to
work
directly
and
get
the
house
in
order
and
then
we
get
you
snugly
settled
in
it
i
shall
see
pittman
today
and
i
will
tell
him
what
i
mean
to
do
i
shall
say
i
wish
to
have
you
for
a
tenant
everybody
knows
i
very
fond
of
that
naughty
person
pettifer
so
it
will
seem
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
and
then
i
shall
by
and
by
point
out
to
tryan
that
he
will
be
doing
you
a
service
as
well
as
himself
by
taking
up
his
abode
with
you
i
think
i
can
prevail
upon
him
for
last
night
when
he
was
quite
bent
on
coming
out
into
the
night
air
i
persuaded
him
to
give
it
up
i
only
hope
you
may
my
dear
i
do
desire
anything
better
than
to
do
something
towards
prolonging
tryan
life
for
i
sad
fears
about
him
speak
of
them
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
them
we
will
only
think
about
getting
the
house
ready
we
shall
be
as
busy
as
bees
how
we
shall
want
mother
clever
fingers
i
know
the
room
upstairs
that
will
just
do
for
tryan
study
there
shall
be
no
seats
in
it
except
a
very
easy
chair
and
a
very
easy
sofa
so
that
he
shall
be
obliged
to
rest
himself
when
he
comes
home
chapter
that
was
the
last
terrible
crisis
of
temptation
janet
had
to
pass
through
the
goodwill
of
her
neighbours
the
helpful
sympathy
of
the
friends
who
shared
her
religious
feelings
the
occupations
suggested
to
her
by
tryan
concurred
with
her
strong
spontaneous
impulses
towards
works
of
love
and
mercy
to
fill
up
her
days
with
quiet
social
intercourse
and
charitable
exertion
besides
her
constitution
naturally
healthy
and
strong
was
every
week
tending
with
the
gathering
force
of
habit
to
recover
its
equipoise
and
set
her
free
from
those
physical
solicitations
which
the
smallest
habitual
vice
always
leaves
behind
it
the
prisoner
feels
where
the
iron
has
galled
him
long
after
his
fetters
have
been
loosed
there
were
always
neighbourly
visits
to
be
paid
and
received
and
as
the
months
wore
on
increasing
familiarity
with
janet
present
self
began
to
efface
even
from
minds
as
rigid
as
phipps
the
unpleasant
impressions
that
had
been
left
by
recent
years
janet
was
recovering
the
popularity
which
her
beauty
and
sweetness
of
nature
had
won
for
her
when
she
was
a
girl
and
popularity
as
every
one
knows
is
the
most
complex
and
of
echoes
even
prejudice
could
not
resist
the
fact
that
janet
dempster
was
a
changed
woman
changed
as
the
dusty
bruised
and
plant
is
changed
when
the
soft
rains
of
heaven
have
fallen
on
it
and
that
this
change
was
due
to
influence
the
last
lingering
sneers
against
the
evangelical
curate
began
to
die
out
and
though
much
of
the
feeling
that
had
prompted
them
remained
behind
there
was
an
intimidating
consciousness
that
the
expression
of
such
feeling
would
not
be
effective
jokes
of
that
sort
had
ceased
to
tickle
the
milby
mind
even
budd
and
tomlinson
when
they
saw
tryan
passing
pale
and
worn
along
the
street
had
a
secret
sense
that
this
man
was
somehow
not
that
very
natural
and
comprehensible
thing
a
humbug
that
in
fact
it
was
impossible
to
explain
him
from
the
stomach
and
pocket
point
of
view
twist
and
stretch
their
theory
as
they
might
it
would
not
fit
tryan
and
so
with
that
remarkable
resemblance
as
to
mental
processes
which
may
frequently
be
observed
to
exist
between
plain
men
and
philosophers
they
concluded
that
the
less
they
said
about
him
the
better
among
all
janet
neighbourly
pleasures
there
was
nothing
she
liked
better
than
to
take
an
early
tea
at
the
white
house
and
to
stroll
with
jerome
round
the
garden
and
orchard
there
was
endless
matter
for
talk
between
her
and
the
good
old
man
for
janet
had
that
genuine
delight
in
human
fellowship
which
gives
an
interest
to
all
personal
details
that
come
warm
from
truthful
lips
and
besides
they
had
a
common
interest
in
plans
for
helping
their
poorer
neighbours
one
great
object
of
jerome
charities
was
as
he
often
said
keep
industrious
men
an
women
off
the
parish
i
rether
given
ten
shillin
an
help
a
man
to
stand
on
his
own
legs
nor
pay
to
buy
him
a
parish
crutch
it
the
ruination
on
him
if
he
once
goes
to
the
parish
i
see
many
a
time
if
you
help
a
man
wi
a
present
in
a
neeborly
way
it
sweetens
his
blood
he
thinks
it
kind
on
you
but
the
parish
shillins
turn
it
sour
he
niver
thinks
enough
in
illustration
of
this
opinion
jerome
had
a
large
store
of
details
about
such
persons
as
jim
hardy
the
lost
his
hoss
and
sally
butts
hed
to
sell
her
mangle
though
she
was
as
decent
a
woman
as
need
to
be
to
the
hearing
of
which
details
janet
seriously
inclined
and
you
would
hardly
desire
to
see
a
prettier
picture
than
the
old
man
telling
these
fragments
of
his
simple
experience
as
he
walked
with
shoulders
slightly
bent
among
the
and
espalier
while
janet
in
her
widow
cap
her
dark
eyes
bright
with
interest
went
listening
by
his
side
and
little
lizzie
with
her
nankeen
bonnet
hanging
down
her
back
toddled
on
before
them
jerome
usually
declined
these
lingering
strolls
and
often
observed
niver
see
the
like
to
jerome
when
he
got
dempster
to
talk
to
it
sinnifies
nothin
to
him
whether
we
tea
at
four
or
at
five
he
go
on
till
six
if
you
let
him
alone
he
like
off
his
head
however
jerome
herself
could
not
deny
that
janet
was
a
very
woman
aly
says
she
niver
gets
sich
as
mine
nowhere
i
know
that
very
well
other
folks
buy
at
shops
thick
unwholesome
things
you
might
as
well
eat
a
sponge
the
sight
of
little
lizzie
often
stirred
in
janet
mind
a
sense
of
the
childlessness
which
had
made
a
fatal
blank
in
her
life
she
had
fleeting
thoughts
that
perhaps
among
her
husband
distant
relatives
there
might
be
some
children
whom
she
could
help
to
bring
up
some
little
girl
whom
she
might
adopt
and
she
promised
herself
one
day
or
other
to
hunt
out
a
second
cousin
of
his
a
married
woman
of
whom
he
had
lost
sight
for
many
years
but
at
present
her
hands
and
heart
were
too
full
for
her
to
carry
out
that
scheme
to
her
great
disappointment
her
project
of
settling
pettifer
at
holly
mount
had
been
delayed
by
the
discovery
that
some
repairs
were
necessary
in
order
to
make
the
house
habitable
and
it
was
not
till
september
had
set
in
that
she
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
old
friend
comfortably
installed
and
the
rooms
destined
for
tryan
looking
pretty
and
cosy
to
her
heart
content
she
had
taken
several
of
his
chief
friends
into
her
confidence
and
they
were
warmly
wishing
success
to
her
plan
for
inducing
him
to
quit
poor
wagstaff
dingy
house
and
dubious
cookery
that
he
should
consent
to
some
such
change
was
becoming
more
and
more
a
matter
of
anxiety
to
his
hearers
for
though
no
more
decided
symptoms
were
yet
observable
in
him
than
increasing
emaciation
a
dry
hacking
cough
and
an
occasional
shortness
of
breath
it
was
felt
that
the
fulfilment
of
pratt
prediction
could
not
long
be
deferred
and
that
this
obstinate
persistence
in
labour
and
must
soon
be
peremptorily
cut
short
by
a
total
failure
of
strength
any
hopes
that
the
influence
of
tryan
father
and
sister
would
prevail
on
him
to
change
his
mode
of
life
that
they
would
perhaps
come
to
live
with
him
or
that
his
sister
at
least
might
come
to
see
him
and
that
the
arguments
which
had
failed
from
other
lips
might
be
more
persuasive
from
hers
were
now
quite
dissipated
his
father
had
lately
had
an
attack
of
paralysis
and
could
not
spare
his
only
tendance
on
tryan
return
from
a
visit
to
his
father
miss
linnet
was
very
anxious
to
know
whether
his
sister
had
not
urged
him
to
try
change
of
air
from
his
answers
she
gathered
that
miss
tryan
wished
him
to
give
up
his
curacy
and
travel
or
at
least
go
to
the
south
devonshire
coast
why
will
you
not
do
so
miss
linnet
said
might
come
back
to
us
well
and
strong
and
have
many
years
of
usefulness
before
you
he
answered
quietly
think
people
attach
more
importance
to
such
measures
than
is
warranted
i
do
see
any
good
end
that
is
to
be
served
by
going
to
die
at
nice
instead
of
dying
amongst
one
friends
and
work
i
can
not
leave
milby
at
least
i
will
not
leave
it
voluntarily
but
though
he
remained
immovable
on
this
point
he
had
been
compelled
to
give
up
his
afternoon
service
on
the
sunday
and
to
accept
offer
of
aid
in
the
evening
service
as
well
as
to
curtail
his
weekday
labours
and
he
had
even
written
to
prendergast
to
request
that
he
would
appoint
another
curate
to
the
paddiford
district
on
the
understanding
that
the
new
curate
should
receive
the
salary
but
that
tryan
should
with
him
as
long
as
he
was
able
the
hopefulness
which
is
an
almost
constant
attendant
on
consumption
had
not
the
effect
of
deceiving
him
as
to
the
nature
of
his
malady
or
of
making
him
look
forward
to
ultimate
recovery
he
believed
himself
to
be
consumptive
and
he
had
not
yet
felt
any
desire
to
escape
the
early
death
which
he
had
for
some
time
contemplated
as
probable
even
diseased
hopes
will
take
their
direction
from
the
strong
habitual
bias
of
the
mind
and
to
tryan
death
had
for
years
seemed
nothing
else
than
the
laying
down
of
a
burden
under
which
he
sometimes
felt
himself
fainting
he
was
only
sanguine
about
his
powers
of
work
he
flattered
himself
that
what
he
was
unable
to
do
one
week
he
should
be
equal
to
the
next
and
he
would
not
admit
that
in
desisting
from
any
part
of
his
labour
he
was
renouncing
it
permanently
he
had
lately
delighted
jerome
by
accepting
his
loan
of
the
chacenut
hoss
and
he
found
so
much
benefit
from
substituting
constant
riding
exercise
for
walking
that
he
began
to
think
he
should
soon
be
able
to
resume
some
of
the
work
he
had
dropped
that
was
a
happy
afternoon
for
janet
when
after
exerting
herself
busily
for
a
week
with
her
mother
and
pettifer
she
saw
holly
mount
looking
orderly
and
comfortable
from
attic
to
cellar
it
was
an
old
house
with
two
gables
in
front
and
two
clipped
flanking
the
a
simple
place
that
quiet
people
might
easily
get
fond
of
and
now
it
was
scoured
and
polished
and
carpeted
and
furnished
so
as
to
look
really
snug
within
when
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
janet
delighted
herself
with
contemplating
tryan
study
first
sitting
down
in
the
and
then
lying
for
a
moment
on
the
sofa
that
she
might
have
a
keener
sense
of
the
repose
he
would
get
from
those
articles
of
furniture
which
she
had
gone
to
rotherby
on
purpose
to
choose
mother
she
said
when
she
had
finished
her
survey
have
done
your
work
as
well
as
any
or
that
ever
turned
a
pumpkin
into
a
coach
and
horses
you
stay
and
have
tea
cosily
with
pettifer
while
i
go
to
linnet
i
want
to
tell
mary
and
rebecca
the
good
news
that
i
got
the
exciseman
to
promise
that
he
will
take
wagstaff
lodgings
when
tryan
leaves
they
be
so
pleased
to
hear
it
because
they
thought
he
would
make
her
poverty
an
objection
to
his
leaving
her
my
dear
child
said
raynor
whose
face
always
calm
was
now
a
happy
one
a
cup
of
tea
with
us
first
you
perhaps
miss
linnet
i
feel
too
excited
to
take
tea
yet
i
like
a
child
with
a
new
walking
in
the
air
will
do
me
good
so
she
set
out
holly
mount
was
about
a
mile
from
that
outskirt
of
paddiford
common
where
linnet
house
stood
nestled
among
its
laburnums
lilacs
and
syringas
janet
way
thither
lay
for
a
little
while
along
the
and
then
led
her
into
a
lane
which
wound
through
a
flat
tract
of
meadow
and
pasture
while
in
front
lay
smoky
paddiford
and
away
to
the
left
the
of
milby
there
was
no
line
of
silvery
willows
marking
the
course
of
a
stream
no
group
of
scotch
firs
with
their
trunks
reddening
in
the
level
sunbeams
nothing
to
break
the
flowerless
monotony
of
grass
and
hedgerow
but
an
occasional
oak
or
elm
and
a
few
cows
sprinkled
here
and
there
a
very
commonplace
scene
indeed
but
what
scene
was
ever
commonplace
in
the
descending
sunlight
when
colour
has
awakened
from
its
noonday
sleep
and
the
long
shadows
awe
us
like
a
disclosed
presence
above
all
what
scene
is
commonplace
to
the
eye
that
is
filled
with
serene
gladness
and
brightens
all
things
with
its
own
joy
and
janet
just
now
was
very
happy
as
she
walked
along
the
rough
lane
with
a
buoyant
step
a
half
smile
of
innocent
kindly
triumph
played
about
her
mouth
she
was
delighting
beforehand
in
the
anticipated
success
of
her
persuasive
power
and
for
the
time
her
painful
anxiety
about
tryan
health
was
thrown
into
abeyance
but
she
had
not
gone
far
along
the
lane
before
she
heard
the
sound
of
a
horse
advancing
at
a
walking
pace
behind
her
without
looking
back
she
turned
aside
to
make
way
for
it
between
the
ruts
and
did
not
notice
that
for
a
moment
it
had
stopped
and
had
then
come
on
with
a
slightly
quickened
pace
in
less
than
a
minute
she
heard
a
voice
say
dempster
and
turning
saw
tryan
close
to
her
holding
his
horse
by
the
bridle
it
seemed
very
natural
to
her
that
he
should
be
there
her
mind
was
so
full
of
his
presence
at
that
moment
that
the
actual
sight
of
him
was
only
like
a
more
vivid
thought
and
she
behaved
as
we
are
apt
to
do
when
feeling
obliges
us
to
be
genuine
with
a
total
forgetfulness
of
polite
forms
she
only
looked
at
him
with
a
slight
deepening
of
the
smile
that
was
already
on
her
face
he
said
gently
my
arm
and
they
walked
on
a
little
way
in
silence
it
was
he
who
broke
it
are
going
to
paddiford
i
suppose
the
question
recalled
janet
to
the
consciousness
that
this
was
an
unexpected
opportunity
for
beginning
her
work
of
persuasion
and
that
she
was
stupidly
neglecting
it
she
said
was
going
to
linnet
i
knew
miss
linnet
would
like
to
hear
that
our
friend
pettifer
is
quite
settled
now
in
her
new
house
she
is
as
fond
of
pettifer
as
i
am
almost
i
wo
admit
that
any
one
loves
her
as
well
for
no
one
else
has
such
good
reason
as
i
have
but
now
the
dear
woman
wants
a
lodger
for
you
know
she
ca
afford
to
live
in
so
large
a
house
by
herself
but
i
knew
when
i
persuaded
her
to
go
there
that
she
would
be
sure
to
get
one
she
such
a
comfortable
creature
to
live
with
and
i
did
like
her
to
spend
all
the
rest
of
her
days
up
that
dull
passage
being
at
every
one
beck
and
call
who
wanted
to
make
use
of
her
said
tryan
quite
understand
your
feeling
i
do
wonder
at
your
strong
regard
for
her
but
now
i
want
her
other
friends
to
second
me
there
she
is
with
three
rooms
to
let
ready
furnished
everything
in
order
and
i
know
some
one
who
thinks
as
well
of
her
as
i
do
and
who
would
be
doing
good
all
round
to
every
one
that
knows
him
as
well
as
to
pettifer
if
he
would
go
to
live
with
her
he
would
leave
some
uncomfortable
lodgings
which
another
person
is
already
coveting
and
would
take
immediately
and
he
would
go
to
breathe
pure
air
at
holly
mount
and
gladden
pettifer
heart
by
letting
her
wait
on
him
and
comfort
all
his
friends
who
are
quite
miserable
about
him
tryan
saw
it
all
in
a
moment
he
saw
that
it
had
all
been
done
for
his
sake
he
could
not
be
sorry
he
could
not
say
no
he
could
not
resist
the
sense
that
life
had
a
new
sweetness
for
him
and
that
he
should
like
it
to
be
prolonged
a
little
only
a
little
for
the
sake
of
feeling
a
stronger
security
about
janet
when
she
had
finished
speaking
she
looked
at
him
with
a
doubtful
inquiring
glance
he
was
not
looking
at
her
his
eyes
were
cast
downwards
but
the
expression
of
his
face
encouraged
her
and
she
said
in
a
tone
of
entreaty
go
and
live
with
her
i
know
you
will
you
will
come
back
with
me
now
and
see
the
house
he
looked
at
her
then
and
smiled
there
is
an
unspeakable
blending
of
sadness
and
sweetness
in
the
smile
of
a
face
sharpened
and
paled
by
slow
consumption
that
smile
of
tryan
pierced
poor
janet
heart
she
felt
in
it
at
once
the
assurance
of
grateful
affection
and
the
prophecy
of
coming
death
her
tears
rose
they
turned
round
without
speaking
and
went
back
again
along
the
lane
chapter
in
less
than
a
week
tryan
was
settled
at
holly
mount
and
there
was
not
one
of
his
many
attached
hearers
who
did
not
sincerely
rejoice
at
the
event
the
autumn
that
year
was
bright
and
warm
and
at
the
beginning
of
october
walsh
the
new
curate
came
the
mild
weather
the
relaxation
from
excessive
work
and
perhaps
another
benignant
influence
had
for
a
few
weeks
a
visibly
favourable
effect
on
tryan
at
least
he
began
to
feel
new
hopes
which
sometimes
took
the
guise
of
new
strength
he
thought
of
the
cases
in
which
consumption
patients
remain
nearly
stationary
for
years
without
suffering
so
as
to
make
their
life
burdensome
to
themselves
or
to
others
and
he
began
to
struggle
with
a
longing
that
it
might
be
so
with
him
he
struggled
with
it
because
he
felt
it
to
be
an
indication
that
earthly
affection
was
beginning
to
have
too
strong
a
hold
on
him
and
he
prayed
earnestly
for
more
perfect
submission
and
for
a
more
absorbing
delight
in
the
divine
presence
as
the
chief
good
he
was
conscious
that
he
did
not
wish
for
prolonged
life
solely
that
he
might
reclaim
the
wanderers
and
sustain
the
feeble
he
was
conscious
of
a
new
yearning
for
those
pure
human
joys
which
he
had
voluntarily
and
determinedly
banished
from
his
life
for
a
draught
of
that
deep
affection
from
which
he
had
been
cut
off
by
a
dark
chasm
of
remorse
for
now
that
affection
was
within
his
reach
he
saw
it
there
like
a
well
in
the
desert
he
not
desire
to
die
in
sight
of
it
and
so
the
autumn
rolled
gently
by
in
its
decay
until
november
tryan
continued
to
preach
occasionally
to
ride
about
visiting
his
flock
and
to
look
in
at
his
schools
but
his
growing
satisfaction
in
walsh
as
his
successor
saved
him
from
too
eager
exertion
and
from
worrying
anxieties
janet
was
with
him
a
great
deal
now
for
she
saw
that
he
liked
her
to
read
to
him
in
the
lengthening
evenings
and
it
became
the
rule
for
her
and
her
mother
to
have
tea
at
holly
mount
where
with
pettifer
and
sometimes
another
friend
or
two
they
brought
tryan
the
unaccustomed
enjoyment
of
companionship
by
his
own
fireside
janet
did
not
share
his
new
hopes
for
she
was
not
only
in
the
habit
of
hearing
pratt
opinion
that
tryan
could
hardly
stand
out
through
the
winter
but
she
also
knew
that
it
was
shared
by
dr
madely
of
rotherby
whom
at
her
request
he
had
consented
to
call
in
it
was
not
necessary
or
desirable
to
tell
tryan
what
was
revealed
by
the
stethoscope
but
janet
knew
the
worst
she
felt
no
rebellion
under
this
prospect
of
bereavement
but
rather
a
quiet
submissive
sorrow
gratitude
that
his
influence
and
guidance
had
been
given
her
even
if
only
for
a
little
while
gratitude
that
she
was
permitted
to
be
with
him
to
take
a
deeper
and
deeper
impress
from
daily
communion
with
him
to
be
something
to
him
in
these
last
months
of
his
life
was
so
strong
in
her
that
it
almost
silenced
regret
janet
had
lived
through
the
great
tragedy
of
woman
life
her
keenest
personal
emotions
had
been
poured
forth
in
her
early
love
her
wounded
affection
with
its
years
of
anguish
her
agony
of
unavailing
pity
over
that
deathbed
seven
months
ago
the
thought
of
tryan
was
associated
for
her
with
repose
from
that
conflict
of
emotion
with
trust
in
the
unchangeable
with
the
influx
of
a
power
to
subdue
self
to
have
been
assured
of
his
sympathy
his
teaching
his
help
all
through
her
life
would
have
been
to
her
like
a
heaven
already
begun
a
deliverance
from
fear
and
danger
but
the
time
was
not
yet
come
for
her
to
be
conscious
that
the
hold
he
had
on
her
heart
was
any
other
than
that
of
the
friend
who
had
come
to
her
like
the
angel
in
the
prison
and
loosed
her
bonds
and
led
her
by
the
hand
till
she
could
look
back
on
the
dreadful
doors
that
had
once
closed
her
in
before
november
was
over
tryan
had
ceased
to
go
out
a
new
crisis
had
come
on
the
cough
had
changed
its
character
and
the
worst
symptoms
developed
themselves
so
rapidly
that
pratt
began
to
think
the
end
would
arrive
sooner
than
he
had
expected
janet
became
a
constant
attendant
on
him
now
and
no
one
could
feel
that
she
was
performing
anything
but
a
sacred
office
she
made
holly
mount
her
home
and
with
her
mother
and
pettifer
to
help
her
she
filled
the
painful
days
and
nights
with
every
soothing
influence
that
care
and
tenderness
could
devise
there
were
many
visitors
to
the
led
thither
by
venerating
affection
and
there
could
hardly
be
one
who
did
not
retain
in
after
years
a
vivid
remembrance
of
the
scene
there
of
the
pale
wasted
form
in
the
for
he
sat
up
to
the
last
of
the
grey
eyes
so
full
even
yet
of
inquiring
kindness
as
the
thin
almost
transparent
hand
was
held
out
to
give
the
pressure
of
welcome
and
of
the
sweet
woman
too
whose
dark
watchful
eyes
detected
every
want
and
who
supplied
the
want
with
a
ready
hand
there
were
others
who
would
have
had
the
heart
and
the
skill
to
fill
this
place
by
tryan
side
and
who
would
have
accepted
it
as
an
honour
but
they
could
not
help
feeling
that
god
had
given
it
to
janet
by
a
train
of
events
which
were
too
impressive
not
to
shame
all
jealousies
into
silence
that
sad
history
which
most
of
us
know
too
well
lasted
more
than
three
months
he
was
too
feeble
and
suffering
for
the
last
few
weeks
to
see
any
visitors
but
he
still
sat
up
through
the
day
the
strange
hallucinations
of
the
disease
which
had
seemed
to
take
a
more
decided
hold
on
him
just
at
the
fatal
crisis
and
had
made
him
think
he
was
perhaps
getting
better
at
the
very
time
when
death
had
begun
to
hurry
on
with
more
rapid
movement
had
now
given
way
and
left
him
calmly
conscious
of
the
reality
one
afternoon
near
the
end
of
february
janet
was
moving
gently
about
the
room
in
the
dusk
arranging
some
things
that
would
be
wanted
in
the
night
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
and
his
eyes
followed
her
as
she
moved
with
the
firm
grace
natural
to
her
while
the
bright
fire
every
now
and
then
lit
up
her
face
and
gave
an
unusual
glow
to
its
dark
beauty
even
to
follow
her
in
this
way
with
his
eyes
was
an
exertion
that
gave
a
painful
tension
to
his
face
while
she
looked
like
an
image
of
life
and
strength
he
said
presently
in
his
faint
voice
he
always
called
her
janet
now
in
a
moment
she
was
close
to
him
bending
over
him
he
opened
his
hand
as
he
looked
up
at
her
and
she
placed
hers
within
it
he
said
again
will
have
a
long
while
to
live
after
i
am
gone
a
sudden
pang
of
fear
shot
through
her
she
thought
he
felt
himself
dying
and
she
sank
on
her
knees
at
his
feet
holding
his
hand
while
she
looked
up
at
him
almost
breathless
you
will
not
feel
the
need
of
me
as
you
have
done
you
have
a
sure
trust
in
god
i
shall
not
look
for
you
in
vain
at
the
last
no
i
shall
be
there
god
will
not
forsake
me
she
could
hardly
utter
the
words
though
she
was
not
weeping
she
was
waiting
with
trembling
eagerness
for
anything
else
he
might
have
to
say
us
kiss
each
other
before
we
part
she
lifted
up
her
face
to
his
and
the
full
lips
met
the
wasted
dying
ones
in
a
sacred
kiss
of
promise
chapter
it
soon
came
the
blessed
day
of
deliverance
the
sad
day
of
bereavement
and
in
the
second
week
of
march
they
carried
him
to
the
grave
he
was
buried
as
he
had
desired
there
was
no
hearse
no
his
coffin
was
borne
by
twelve
of
his
humbler
hearers
who
relieved
each
other
by
turns
but
he
was
followed
by
a
long
procession
of
mourning
friends
women
as
well
as
men
slowly
amid
deep
silence
the
dark
stream
passed
along
orchard
street
where
eighteen
months
before
the
evangelical
curate
had
been
saluted
with
hooting
and
hisses
jerome
and
landor
were
the
eldest
and
behind
the
coffin
led
by
tryan
cousin
walked
janet
in
quiet
submissive
sorrow
she
could
not
feel
that
he
was
quite
gone
from
her
the
unseen
world
lay
so
very
near
her
it
held
all
that
had
ever
stirred
the
depths
of
anguish
and
joy
within
her
it
was
a
cloudy
morning
and
had
been
raining
when
they
left
holly
mount
but
as
they
walked
the
sun
broke
out
and
the
clouds
were
rolling
off
in
large
masses
when
they
entered
the
churchyard
and
walsh
voice
was
heard
saying
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
the
faces
were
not
hard
at
this
funeral
the
was
not
a
hollow
form
every
heart
there
was
filled
with
the
memory
of
a
man
who
through
a
life
and
in
a
painful
death
had
been
sustained
by
the
faith
which
fills
that
form
with
breath
and
substance
when
janet
left
the
grave
she
did
not
return
to
holly
mount
she
went
to
her
home
in
orchard
street
where
her
mother
was
waiting
to
receive
her
she
said
quite
calmly
us
walk
round
the
garden
mother
and
they
walked
round
in
silence
with
their
hands
clasped
together
looking
at
the
golden
crocuses
bright
in
the
spring
sunshine
janet
felt
a
deep
stillness
within
she
thirsted
for
no
pleasure
she
craved
no
worldly
good
she
saw
the
years
to
come
stretch
before
her
like
an
autumn
afternoon
filled
with
resigned
memory
life
to
her
could
never
more
have
any
eagerness
it
was
a
solemn
service
of
gratitude
and
patient
effort
she
walked
in
the
presence
of
unseen
witnesses
of
the
divine
love
that
had
rescued
her
of
the
human
love
that
waited
for
its
eternal
repose
until
it
had
seen
her
endure
to
the
end
janet
is
living
still
her
black
hair
is
grey
and
her
step
is
no
longer
buoyant
but
the
sweetness
of
her
smile
remains
the
love
is
not
gone
from
her
eyes
and
strangers
sometimes
ask
who
is
that
elderly
woman
that
walks
about
holding
a
little
boy
by
the
hand
the
little
boy
is
the
son
of
janet
adopted
daughter
and
janet
in
her
old
age
has
children
about
her
knees
and
loving
young
arms
round
her
neck
there
is
a
simple
gravestone
in
milby
churchyard
telling
that
in
this
spot
lie
the
remains
of
edgar
tryan
for
two
years
officiating
curate
at
the
paddiford
in
this
parish
it
is
a
meagre
memorial
and
tells
you
simply
that
the
man
who
lies
there
took
upon
him
faithfully
or
unfaithfully
the
office
of
guide
and
instructor
to
his
fellowmen
but
there
is
another
memorial
of
edgar
tryan
which
bears
a
fuller
record
it
is
janet
dempster
rescued
from
strengthened
with
divine
hopes
and
now
looking
back
on
years
of
purity
and
helpful
labour
the
man
who
has
left
such
a
memorial
behind
him
must
have
been
one
whose
heart
beat
with
true
compassion
and
whose
lips
were
moved
by
fervent
faith
the
end
