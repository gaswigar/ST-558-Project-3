introduction
while
engaged
in
writing
the
story
of
evelin
delorme
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
herbert
flint
the
hypnotist
briefly
referred
to
in
chapter
three
the
science
of
hypnotism
being
a
theme
of
absorbing
interest
to
me
i
eagerly
availed
myself
of
the
opportunity
thus
offered
for
exhaustive
investigation
of
the
subject
and
was
accorded
frequent
and
prolonged
interviews
with
flint
during
one
of
these
i
reviewed
to
him
briefly
the
outline
of
my
story
and
the
strange
mystery
of
evelin
delorme
which
had
given
rise
to
the
plot
i
saw
at
once
that
he
was
unusually
moved
and
interested
at
my
conclusion
he
arose
hastily
and
left
the
room
returning
a
moment
later
with
a
quantity
of
papers
which
proved
to
be
an
unpublished
memoir
which
he
was
then
preparing
from
this
he
hurriedly
separated
several
sheets
and
placed
them
in
my
hand
remarking
with
suppressed
feeling
here
is
the
missing
link
in
your
narrative
he
has
allowed
me
to
publish
it
here
in
his
own
words
extract
from
the
unpublished
memoirs
of
flint
the
following
is
a
brief
account
of
a
very
curious
case
of
hypnotic
suggestion
and
one
which
because
of
the
mystery
surrounding
its
final
outcome
has
caused
me
no
little
anxiety
on
the
of
july
there
came
to
my
office
in
louis
a
strikingly
beautiful
young
woman
of
evident
wealth
and
aristocratic
breeding
who
gave
her
name
as
eva
delorme
her
dress
indicated
recent
bereavement
and
her
face
impressed
me
as
being
that
of
one
whom
death
had
deprived
of
all
those
near
and
beloved
she
stated
her
errand
at
once
and
briefly
she
had
been
pursuing
the
study
of
mesmeric
sciences
and
believing
herself
a
good
hypnotic
subject
desired
that
i
make
a
trial
with
that
end
in
view
a
simple
test
convinced
me
that
she
was
susceptible
to
hypnotic
suggestion
and
further
experiment
revealed
to
me
that
she
was
one
of
the
most
perfect
subjects
i
have
ever
known
she
called
again
the
day
following
and
asked
me
if
it
were
possible
through
the
aid
of
hypnotism
to
give
to
her
a
double
personality
adding
that
she
desired
to
become
for
a
few
hours
a
heartless
haughty
gay
woman
of
the
world
precisely
opposite
in
fact
to
what
she
really
appeared
believing
that
she
wished
to
forget
her
sorrow
for
a
time
i
assured
her
that
i
thought
this
might
be
accomplished
and
that
it
would
probably
obliterate
all
knowledge
of
a
previous
existence
for
the
time
being
to
this
she
eagerly
consented
and
after
some
further
conversation
concerning
the
details
i
asked
her
what
name
she
desired
to
assume
in
her
new
character
she
replied
that
her
full
name
was
evelin
march
delorme
of
which
in
her
assumed
personality
she
would
retain
the
first
two
she
likewise
gave
me
a
memorandum
of
a
street
and
number
to
which
she
was
to
be
directed
this
being
doubtless
one
of
several
of
her
dwelling
properties
for
she
impressed
me
always
as
a
person
of
abundant
wealth
with
a
few
passes
i
then
placed
her
under
the
hypnotic
influence
and
while
in
this
state
i
impressed
upon
her
earnestly
the
fact
that
she
would
awaken
a
haughty
and
heartless
woman
of
the
world
dashing
and
gay
free
from
past
regrets
and
future
misgivings
as
she
had
told
me
to
do
that
her
name
would
be
evelin
march
and
i
repeated
to
her
the
street
and
number
and
some
minor
details
which
she
had
given
to
me
that
she
would
retain
this
personality
for
twelve
hours
this
i
repeated
to
her
several
times
then
bade
her
awaken
the
change
in
her
was
complete
and
startling
her
whole
expression
even
her
very
features
appeared
altered
accustomed
as
i
am
to
such
things
i
could
not
avoid
feeling
somewhat
nervous
at
this
wonderful
transformation
in
her
new
character
she
was
as
beautiful
and
imperious
as
a
queen
with
a
supercilious
almost
coarse
expression
of
countenance
she
seemed
much
mortified
at
the
somber
simpleness
of
her
dress
and
i
judge
went
immediately
to
make
changes
i
did
not
see
her
again
until
a
week
later
when
she
came
to
my
office
apparently
restored
to
her
true
character
she
had
a
vague
of
what
had
been
her
experience
in
the
other
state
and
desired
a
second
trial
to
which
i
somewhat
reluctantly
consented
though
i
must
confess
i
was
by
this
time
deeply
interested
in
the
case
these
transformations
were
frequently
repeated
during
the
next
few
months
then
her
visits
ceased
and
i
did
not
see
her
until
a
year
later
when
i
was
astounded
one
day
to
meet
her
riding
in
forest
park
her
assumed
evidently
having
taken
on
the
condition
unaided
either
unconsciously
or
of
her
own
volition
i
never
saw
her
again
and
as
i
had
mislaid
the
memorandum
of
her
address
and
the
number
had
slipped
my
memory
i
lost
trace
of
her
entirely
i
have
always
felt
a
great
and
somewhat
guilty
curiosity
as
to
the
final
result
of
this
strange
experiment
the
mystery
of
evelin
delorme
prologue
julian
paul
goetze
died
december
this
event
removed
the
final
reason
for
concealment
of
that
strange
story
whose
dark
reality
flung
a
shadow
about
his
later
years
at
his
death
goetze
was
in
his
year
and
for
more
than
a
decade
previous
had
been
considered
one
of
the
foremost
portrait
painters
of
the
younger
school
i
knew
him
intimately
was
a
frequent
visitor
at
his
studio
and
i
believe
the
only
confidant
he
was
ever
known
to
have
as
i
recall
those
years
there
is
an
unreality
about
them
that
i
am
unable
to
dispel
the
problems
discussed
the
theories
maintained
of
life
death
art
poetry
and
any
number
of
other
unfathomed
subjects
appear
to
me
now
so
preternatural
the
conceptions
of
his
wonderful
brain
so
startling
that
i
can
hardly
realize
having
ever
been
a
part
even
though
but
a
faint
reflex
of
that
dazzling
and
unsated
life
in
appearance
he
was
no
less
remarkable
his
figure
was
rather
slight
than
otherwise
and
of
medium
height
his
features
though
greatly
modified
were
distinctly
those
of
the
american
indian
high
cheek
bones
slightly
aquiline
nose
dark
olive
skin
his
eyes
and
hair
were
a
blue
black
you
would
hardly
have
called
him
handsome
but
there
was
something
in
that
fiercely
intense
face
in
the
lithe
grace
of
movement
in
the
small
and
exquisitely
shaped
hands
and
feet
that
made
him
a
fascinating
if
not
a
dangerous
companion
for
the
other
sex
all
of
these
had
been
bequeathed
him
by
his
mother
in
whose
veins
ran
the
french
and
indian
blood
in
equal
parts
from
his
father
a
german
he
had
inherited
only
his
name
his
nature
was
a
strange
blending
of
opposing
forces
forever
at
civil
war
and
each
swaying
him
in
turn
he
had
few
friends
but
those
few
adored
him
for
his
splendid
genius
and
prodigal
generosity
pitying
his
darker
side
when
as
not
unfrequently
happened
he
locked
his
studio
and
plunged
for
days
into
abject
depravity
they
sought
him
out
and
led
him
back
to
his
better
self
after
the
culmination
of
that
singular
affair
narrated
in
these
papers
and
for
which
he
doubtless
felt
himself
greatly
to
blame
these
lapses
became
more
and
more
frequent
and
protracted
the
facts
which
i
have
collected
relating
to
this
period
of
his
life
were
many
of
them
gathered
bit
by
bit
as
the
events
occurred
and
later
from
brief
interviews
during
temporary
periods
of
consciousness
just
prior
to
his
death
it
was
in
one
of
these
that
he
apprised
me
of
the
existence
of
certain
private
papers
the
contents
of
which
would
make
the
chain
of
circumstances
complete
then
the
fires
that
had
blazed
forever
within
him
burned
out
his
life
louis
note
by
the
the
above
accompanied
by
a
manuscript
roll
of
considerable
size
a
crumpled
and
yellow
letter
torn
in
halves
and
a
number
of
loose
pages
covered
with
peculiar
writing
unsigned
though
evidently
the
work
of
the
unhappy
artist
lie
before
me
it
is
with
hesitating
and
unsteady
hands
that
i
separate
these
silent
voices
of
the
past
and
gather
them
at
last
together
into
a
living
though
unworthy
echo
of
my
own
i
a
little
more
to
the
light
please
so
that
is
better
the
artist
worked
rapidly
now
and
then
letting
his
eyes
rest
for
a
moment
on
his
sitter
then
returning
to
the
face
on
the
canvas
that
was
rapidly
growing
under
his
hands
the
studio
a
small
swiss
cottage
some
distance
from
the
business
center
of
louis
was
rather
richly
though
plainly
furnished
the
walls
were
tinted
a
neutral
gray
an
occasional
piece
of
drapery
hung
here
and
there
while
a
heavily
curtained
arch
at
the
back
connected
with
the
artist
private
apartments
beyond
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
a
door
opened
to
the
little
entrance
hall
and
near
to
this
doorway
was
a
carved
oaken
mantel
above
which
were
grouped
together
a
number
of
curious
weapons
evidently
gathered
here
and
there
as
and
used
perhaps
now
and
then
as
properties
in
the
arrangement
of
some
picture
there
was
the
and
elaborately
ornamented
gun
of
the
arab
the
scimitar
of
the
turk
the
of
the
south
american
indian
the
bow
and
arrow
of
his
northern
brother
at
the
bottom
of
this
array
was
a
pair
of
french
rapiers
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
blades
were
crossed
and
rested
upon
a
nail
and
upon
this
nail
there
hung
point
downward
a
italian
stiletto
or
dagger
suspended
by
a
silken
cord
the
room
was
lighted
by
a
and
one
window
only
the
light
of
the
former
falling
upon
the
sitter
a
large
japanese
screen
diverting
all
other
direct
rays
through
the
casement
a
light
breath
of
summer
crept
in
from
the
little
garden
outside
freighted
with
the
mingled
odors
of
and
white
flowering
locust
a
yellow
butterfly
flitted
in
and
out
now
and
then
making
a
circuit
of
the
room
resting
here
and
there
for
a
moment
to
fan
noiselessly
with
its
bloomy
wings
a
stray
bee
buzzed
drowsily
in
but
finding
nothing
so
attractive
as
the
sweets
without
hastily
retreated
striking
heavily
against
the
where
it
sputtered
and
fumed
for
a
time
and
gladly
escaped
then
all
was
silent
in
the
room
save
for
the
light
chafing
sound
made
by
the
artist
brush
against
the
hitherto
untouched
canvas
he
at
the
easel
was
a
man
of
about
thirty
years
julian
paul
goetze
a
name
already
ranked
high
among
his
profession
his
sitter
was
a
woman
of
perhaps
her
figure
was
somewhat
above
medium
height
and
perfectly
developed
she
was
clad
in
a
plain
trimly
fitting
dress
of
silver
gray
with
a
neat
white
collar
at
the
throat
her
face
was
a
perfect
oval
in
its
contour
her
complexion
almost
childish
in
its
delicacy
her
hair
a
silky
brown
in
color
was
fastened
in
a
knot
at
the
back
of
her
shapely
head
while
in
front
it
was
a
fluffy
mass
that
partially
concealed
the
forehead
and
softly
shadowed
what
seemed
to
the
artist
to
be
the
sweetest
face
in
all
the
world
the
features
were
as
delicately
chiseled
as
one
would
expect
to
find
them
in
a
statue
of
purity
the
eyes
were
a
deep
gray
inclining
to
hazel
and
the
coloring
of
the
cheek
and
lips
so
tender
that
the
artist
looked
a
little
despairingly
at
the
tints
upon
his
palette
while
through
all
there
pervaded
such
an
expression
of
absolute
innocence
and
freedom
from
the
world
taint
as
to
find
expression
in
but
the
one
word
saintliness
and
yet
there
was
something
about
the
face
of
his
sitter
that
brought
a
troubled
expression
to
that
of
the
artist
as
with
bold
rapid
strokes
he
laid
in
the
for
the
hair
he
looked
puzzled
as
he
traced
the
exquisite
outline
of
the
ear
his
look
was
almost
one
of
vexation
once
he
left
his
easel
and
going
to
another
canvas
that
rested
on
the
floor
face
to
the
wall
he
turned
it
partly
about
and
looked
at
it
intently
for
a
few
moments
then
he
resumed
his
work
evidently
in
deep
thought
for
awhile
he
painted
on
in
silence
he
was
inclined
by
nature
to
be
diffident
at
first
with
his
sitters
and
with
this
fair
being
the
beginning
of
a
conversation
seemed
to
him
a
thing
as
difficult
as
it
was
desirable
there
was
a
suggestion
of
weariness
in
her
face
too
which
he
felt
would
disappear
with
awakened
interest
i
i
beg
pardon
he
said
somewhat
abruptly
at
length
have
you
ever
had
a
portrait
before
his
voice
was
rich
and
musical
and
the
face
before
him
brightened
oh
no
and
it
is
only
by
accident
that
i
am
having
one
now
i
was
passing
and
saw
your
name
i
knew
it
by
reputation
and
it
occurred
to
me
all
at
once
that
i
would
sit
for
my
picture
perhaps
i
should
have
waited
and
worn
a
different
dress
it
was
only
a
passing
impulse
it
never
occurred
to
me
before
i
can
not
tell
why
it
did
now
the
animation
and
the
faint
blush
that
had
crept
over
her
face
while
she
spoke
were
enchanting
the
artist
was
delighted
your
dress
could
not
have
been
better
chosen
and
the
impulse
was
surely
an
inspiration
he
said
smiling
and
perhaps
he
added
you
may
have
a
friend
or
a
a
relative
who
has
had
or
is
having
a
portrait
which
suggested
the
idea
as
he
paused
he
looked
at
her
inquiringly
the
look
of
weariness
had
returned
to
her
face
no
i
have
no
relatives
and
she
blushed
deeply
and
was
silent
forgive
me
he
said
earnestly
i
did
not
intend
to
be
inquisitive
she
did
not
reply
in
words
but
as
she
lifted
her
eyes
there
was
a
tenderness
there
that
awakened
within
him
all
the
sympathy
the
nobleness
and
the
affection
of
his
purer
and
better
nature
their
eyes
met
and
in
a
single
moment
there
was
formed
between
them
an
invisible
bond
which
both
felt
and
neither
sought
to
conceal
no
word
was
spoken
the
artist
painted
on
in
silence
but
a
new
light
had
come
into
his
sitter
face
and
a
new
source
of
inspiration
into
his
own
heart
for
a
long
time
neither
spoke
a
dreamy
hush
seemed
to
creep
in
with
the
sweet
odors
from
the
garden
and
with
them
a
summer
restfulness
and
peace
the
yellow
butterfly
that
had
been
hovering
about
them
flitting
this
way
and
that
came
closer
and
closer
and
at
last
settled
fearlessly
upon
one
of
the
gloved
hands
that
lay
folded
in
the
lap
she
watched
it
for
a
moment
then
looked
up
at
the
painter
with
a
smile
the
insect
has
a
true
instinct
he
said
gently
it
has
no
fear
of
capture
no
i
should
only
hurt
it
and
destroy
its
beauty
butterflies
said
the
artist
are
like
beautiful
thoughts
they
hover
mistily
about
us
flitting
away
whenever
we
attempt
to
capture
them
and
if
at
last
we
are
successful
we
find
only
too
often
that
their
wings
have
lost
the
delicacy
of
their
bloom
yes
i
have
felt
that
many
times
while
she
spoke
the
insect
rose
hastily
in
the
air
as
if
frightened
and
circling
about
for
a
moment
above
them
darted
out
through
the
open
window
i
have
heard
they
are
emblems
of
inconstancy
too
she
said
thoughtfully
as
it
disappeared
a
faint
glow
of
crimson
suffused
for
an
instant
the
olive
face
before
her
but
he
forced
a
smile
and
did
not
reply
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
slipped
away
with
but
little
interchange
of
words
between
artist
and
sitter
when
either
spoke
the
words
were
few
and
simple
but
there
was
a
tenderness
in
their
voices
that
uttered
more
than
the
spoken
syllables
the
face
on
the
canvas
was
growing
rapidly
he
had
already
worked
longer
than
he
usually
did
at
the
first
sitting
and
yet
he
could
not
bear
to
let
her
go
he
had
seen
her
for
the
first
time
less
than
two
hours
before
he
did
not
even
know
her
name
the
little
white
card
which
she
had
given
him
he
had
glanced
at
without
reading
he
had
only
seen
her
features
and
heard
only
the
gentle
voice
that
had
made
known
her
errand
and
now
he
wondered
if
it
were
possible
that
only
a
few
hours
before
she
had
had
no
part
in
his
life
a
life
wherein
there
had
been
many
lights
and
shadows
and
the
shadows
had
been
ever
as
broad
and
somber
as
the
lights
had
been
bold
and
brilliant
ii
an
hour
later
julian
goetze
was
standing
alone
in
his
studio
the
sketch
fresh
from
his
brush
was
before
him
and
beneath
it
resting
upon
the
floor
was
another
somewhat
farther
advanced
he
had
painted
until
the
light
had
begun
to
grow
yellow
and
dim
then
he
had
reluctantly
told
his
sitter
that
he
could
do
no
more
for
that
day
and
when
shall
i
come
again
she
had
asked
he
would
have
said
come
had
he
dared
but
remembering
other
engagements
and
knowing
that
the
work
could
not
be
continued
so
soon
he
had
hesitated
before
replying
i
can
go
on
with
the
picture
in
two
or
three
days
come
as
soon
after
that
as
as
you
wish
he
said
softly
their
eyes
met
for
a
moment
the
delicate
color
deepened
in
her
cheeks
her
lips
murmured
a
half
inaudible
word
of
adieu
and
she
was
gone
julian
left
alone
had
flung
himself
into
a
large
chair
that
stood
near
the
window
and
looked
out
upon
the
little
garden
beyond
it
was
june
the
days
were
long
and
the
sun
was
still
touching
the
tops
of
the
locust
trees
he
was
away
from
the
bustle
of
the
city
and
an
atmosphere
of
peace
almost
like
that
of
the
country
was
about
him
all
at
once
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
pressing
his
fingers
hard
into
his
eyes
i
love
her
i
love
her
he
groaned
she
is
an
angel
from
heaven
and
i
oh
my
god
if
she
knew
she
would
hate
me
he
rose
and
stood
before
the
face
on
the
easel
then
as
if
suddenly
recollecting
he
approached
the
canvas
that
was
turned
face
to
the
wall
and
which
once
before
that
day
had
claimed
his
attention
and
facing
it
nervously
about
placed
it
beneath
the
other
it
was
the
portrait
of
a
woman
like
the
one
above
her
she
was
fair
and
beautiful
but
here
all
resemblance
apparently
ceased
nothing
could
be
more
widely
different
than
the
characters
that
had
stamped
themselves
upon
the
faces
of
these
two
the
picture
on
the
floor
was
that
of
a
woman
whose
age
might
be
anywhere
from
to
a
woman
of
the
great
world
of
fashion
of
folly
of
intrigue
perhaps
of
vice
her
dress
was
a
rich
ball
costume
exposing
the
white
flesh
of
her
beautiful
arms
her
perfect
shoulders
and
her
pearly
tinted
throat
and
bosom
like
the
other
her
face
was
oval
in
shape
but
seemed
less
perfect
in
its
contour
there
was
a
certain
lack
of
delicacy
and
softness
about
the
outline
that
suggested
the
fierce
chase
after
the
sham
pleasures
of
the
great
social
world
the
rest
of
the
features
were
in
harmony
with
this
idea
the
beautiful
mouth
was
hard
and
cruel
the
lips
and
cheeks
were
bright
as
if
artificially
tinted
or
flushed
with
wine
the
eyes
were
bold
and
the
pupils
seemed
expanded
as
with
belladonna
the
nostrils
of
the
finely
shaped
nose
were
full
and
sensual
her
luxuriant
brown
hair
singularly
like
that
of
the
portrait
above
her
in
color
she
wore
in
the
late
french
mode
combed
back
from
her
high
broad
forehead
and
twisted
into
a
massive
device
at
the
top
her
eyebrows
were
unnaturally
dark
an
artificial
air
pervaded
the
entire
picture
one
felt
that
she
had
an
artificial
soul
a
perfect
prototype
of
folly
feverish
and
heartless
world
as
the
artist
stood
gazing
from
one
to
the
other
the
curious
vexed
and
puzzled
expression
that
had
come
into
his
face
once
before
that
day
returned
he
approached
closely
to
the
work
as
if
to
examine
it
more
minutely
as
he
bent
low
over
the
face
on
the
easel
he
heard
the
street
door
open
he
started
guiltily
and
hastily
turned
both
pictures
to
the
wall
a
moment
later
a
tall
man
of
about
his
own
age
entered
without
knocking
it
was
harry
lawton
the
artist
most
intimate
friend
julian
old
boy
how
goes
it
he
said
cheerily
pretty
well
harry
come
in
yes
i
should
do
that
any
way
i
do
seem
to
be
any
too
welcome
however
nonsense
harry
of
course
you
are
welcome
i
am
very
glad
in
fact
to
see
you
just
now
well
that
better
although
i
must
say
your
face
does
indicate
excessive
joy
sit
down
not
there
here
by
the
door
i
want
to
show
you
something
oh
some
new
and
wonderful
work
of
your
transcendent
genius
i
suppose
by
the
way
how
is
the
picture
for
the
salon
getting
along
tediously
harry
i
seem
to
have
lost
the
spirit
of
the
thing
found
too
much
spirit
of
another
kind
perhaps
no
not
that
i
have
been
a
model
of
abstinence
of
late
and
the
heavens
do
not
fall
no
yes
that
is
let
your
tongue
rest
for
a
moment
please
and
use
your
eyes
while
the
artist
had
been
speaking
he
had
taken
the
large
screen
from
before
the
window
and
moved
his
easel
into
a
stronger
light
upon
it
he
now
placed
the
two
portraits
in
their
former
position
the
effect
upon
the
other
was
vigorous
and
immediate
heavens
julian
where
did
you
get
that
angel
and
that
dev
i
beg
pardon
that
extraordinary
pair
of
beauties
oh
i
see
why
of
course
a
new
idea
for
the
salon
a
modern
guinevere
and
elaine
siren
and
saint
sense
and
innocence
i
congratulate
you
old
boy
they
are
wonderful
please
be
quiet
for
a
moment
harry
they
are
not
for
the
salon
they
are
two
sitters
of
mine
the
one
beneath
has
been
here
twice
the
first
time
about
a
week
ago
the
second
time
day
before
yesterday
the
other
came
for
the
first
time
and
they
are
real
live
women
then
yes
i
was
in
hopes
you
might
recognize
one
or
both
of
them
the
other
shook
his
head
and
gazed
from
one
to
the
other
in
silence
do
you
see
any
any
resemblance
between
them
asked
the
artist
after
a
pause
resemblance
good
lord
no
why
are
they
related
in
any
way
not
that
i
am
aware
of
in
fact
i
am
quite
sure
they
are
not
she
told
me
she
had
no
relatives
um
and
which
do
you
refer
to
as
she
oh
the
upper
one
of
course
well
i
do
see
any
course
about
it
she
was
here
for
the
first
time
i
do
see
why
she
should
begin
by
exchanging
family
confidences
all
things
considered
i
should
have
thought
it
more
than
likely
you
referred
to
the
other
however
i
suppose
you
are
familiar
with
her
family
history
too
do
be
sarcastic
harry
i
know
nothing
of
either
of
them
at
least
not
in
that
way
the
one
who
came
first
gave
her
name
as
evelin
march
she
came
in
suddenly
one
morning
last
week
and
asked
for
a
sitting
she
had
on
a
light
wrap
which
she
laid
off
and
stood
before
me
as
you
see
her
during
the
sitting
she
was
inclined
to
be
lively
and
talkative
her
voice
is
just
a
trifle
harsh
but
she
is
a
remarkably
brilliant
talker
and
a
very
fascinating
woman
i
had
not
met
the
other
then
and
foolishly
allowed
myself
to
say
some
rather
silly
things
to
her
when
she
came
again
i
did
more
you
know
what
a
rash
fool
i
am
harry
well
i
made
love
to
her
she
stirred
me
up
terribly
for
some
reason
of
course
there
was
nothing
of
real
love
in
what
i
felt
for
her
it
was
a
brief
madness
of
the
head
you
know
about
what
i
would
say
under
the
circumstances
oh
perfectly
you
swore
that
her
eyes
were
as
are
lights
in
a
midnight
desert
that
her
tints
would
rival
the
roseate
pearl
of
a
june
sunset
that
her
smiles
would
be
your
only
diet
henceforth
and
forever
that
her
frown
would
be
as
terrible
as
the
day
of
judgment
and
now
what
has
the
other
one
to
do
with
it
lawton
you
will
think
i
am
crazy
and
i
am
perhaps
but
i
love
her
and
more
than
that
i
believe
she
loves
me
no
word
of
it
has
passed
between
us
but
we
understand
oh
we
do
eh
we
we
understand
imitated
lawton
well
this
is
exceedingly
interesting
i
must
say
although
quite
the
thing
to
be
expected
from
one
of
your
temperament
how
very
fortunate
you
are
in
the
choice
of
subjects
too
what
do
you
mean
harry
well
i
should
judge
you
might
divide
up
your
affections
on
those
two
without
any
serious
confliction
of
sentiments
you
are
mistaken
though
i
do
not
care
for
evelin
march
at
all
now
i
am
sorry
i
ever
met
her
i
shall
stop
this
foolish
flirtation
with
her
at
once
quite
likely
and
when
does
evelin
come
again
perhaps
so
well
i
just
drop
in
evening
for
the
latest
evelin
seems
to
be
a
trifle
outclassed
just
at
present
harry
you
are
unkind
i
tell
you
i
love
that
innocent
girl
on
the
easel
there
and
mean
to
marry
her
oh
of
course
i
have
the
least
doubt
of
it
and
now
what
about
the
resemblance
why
look
do
you
see
their
hair
the
shade
of
each
is
exactly
the
same
the
same
silkiness
and
glow
through
it
it
is
very
peculiar
and
notice
the
ear
the
outline
and
formation
of
each
is
identical
you
may
not
have
noticed
these
things
as
i
have
but
it
is
very
rare
that
the
ear
is
anatomically
the
same
in
two
people
there
is
a
similarity
too
about
the
oval
of
the
face
although
less
marked
and
not
unusual
and
there
is
a
faint
suggestion
of
something
else
which
i
feel
but
can
not
locate
i
noticed
these
things
and
they
struck
me
at
once
as
being
a
tie
of
kinship
i
hinted
in
a
miserably
awkward
manner
as
to
relatives
who
might
be
having
their
portraits
painted
it
was
then
she
told
me
that
she
had
no
relatives
and
i
believe
started
to
tell
me
she
had
no
friends
but
she
hesitated
and
was
near
bursting
into
tears
from
that
moment
i
loved
her
i
shall
love
her
always
charming
julian
and
yet
i
fancy
she
is
not
wholly
alone
in
the
world
a
beautiful
and
affluent
maiden
is
not
calculated
to
be
friendless
and
you
will
admit
that
one
who
is
able
to
gratify
a
passing
impulse
for
one
of
julian
paul
goetze
justly
celebrated
portraits
is
not
likely
to
be
destitute
still
i
will
allow
that
there
are
cases
even
among
the
wealthy
that
are
not
entirely
undeserving
of
sympathy
and
if
i
may
judge
from
this
incipient
work
of
your
magic
brush
i
think
i
should
be
willing
to
lavish
any
amount
of
that
article
on
its
original
however
you
have
told
me
her
name
as
yet
i
trust
it
is
not
disappointing
i
do
not
even
know
it
myself
she
gave
me
her
card
i
laid
it
down
and
have
thought
of
it
since
well
really
if
your
love
is
no
greater
than
your
curiosity
your
case
does
not
present
any
very
alarming
features
as
yet
the
artist
had
approached
a
small
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
from
which
he
now
picked
up
a
slip
of
white
pasteboard
and
held
it
to
the
light
then
he
started
a
little
and
was
silent
well
said
his
friend
inquiringly
is
it
mary
mullally
or
nancy
muggins
the
artist
turned
to
the
table
again
and
selected
another
card
somewhat
larger
from
a
little
silver
tray
then
he
returned
to
lawton
and
held
them
before
him
one
above
the
other
like
the
pictures
on
the
lower
one
written
in
a
bold
dashing
hand
were
the
words
evelin
march
and
on
the
other
in
a
neat
and
beautiful
penmanship
eva
delorme
capital
old
fellow
exclaimed
lawton
there
is
an
air
of
harmony
about
the
name
the
handwriting
and
the
face
of
your
charmer
that
is
delightful
what
a
blessing
she
has
no
relatives
but
do
you
notice
nothing
strange
about
these
names
harry
nothing
except
that
both
are
strangely
bewitching
what
more
is
there
why
the
similarity
of
the
first
names
eva
evelin
one
is
frequently
a
contraction
of
the
other
i
do
like
this
harry
it
troubles
me
now
julian
you
are
positively
absurd
here
are
two
women
of
natures
manifestly
as
different
as
light
and
darkness
by
a
coincidence
or
a
distant
family
tie
or
both
their
hair
happens
to
be
the
same
color
not
a
very
unusual
one
either
by
the
way
a
similarity
in
their
names
also
perhaps
one
or
two
other
trifling
resemblances
more
or
less
marked
i
will
admit
myself
that
there
is
something
in
the
face
of
that
siren
that
had
she
kept
herself
unspotted
from
the
world
might
have
suggested
the
other
that
rare
being
there
on
the
easel
who
told
you
she
had
no
relatives
or
friends
and
for
which
reason
you
are
deeply
troubled
it
is
probable
she
told
you
the
exact
truth
i
have
seen
people
who
were
almost
counterparts
of
each
other
between
whom
there
existed
no
known
tie
of
kinship
there
was
once
a
man
in
new
york
who
resembled
jay
gould
so
strikingly
as
to
deceive
their
best
friends
and
besides
the
girl
may
have
relatives
of
whom
she
knows
nothing
most
of
us
have
cousins
whom
we
have
never
seen
or
even
heard
of
should
guinevere
prove
to
be
the
unknown
cousin
of
elaine
i
can
not
see
that
the
purity
and
charm
of
elaine
is
in
any
manner
affected
thereby
yes
harry
that
is
so
besides
besides
the
resemblance
is
positively
trivial
no
one
but
an
artist
would
think
of
it
i
should
never
have
suspected
it
without
your
assistance
in
the
one
face
there
is
written
all
that
is
good
and
pure
and
holy
in
the
other
all
that
is
reckless
unscrupulous
soulless
and
if
not
vicious
might
easily
become
so
it
does
not
take
a
physiognomist
to
see
that
i
beg
pardon
for
saying
so
julian
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
more
similarity
between
the
two
than
there
is
between
the
opposing
elements
of
your
own
strange
nature
the
one
all
that
is
good
and
the
other
well
not
all
that
is
bad
but
very
different
you
know
old
boy
and
it
is
probably
these
forces
within
you
that
answer
to
the
charms
of
these
two
beings
who
are
so
manifestly
opposites
the
one
inspiring
only
the
nobleness
of
a
blameless
love
the
other
suggesting
the
abandonment
of
a
reckless
passion
iii
the
light
in
the
studio
was
growing
dim
goetze
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
was
walking
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
portraits
when
he
spoke
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
them
except
as
the
representation
of
an
abstract
principle
or
perhaps
he
was
thinking
of
his
own
nature
and
what
his
friend
had
said
of
it
good
and
bad
are
relative
terms
only
he
said
as
one
pronouncing
a
text
every
man
fulfills
his
purpose
i
can
put
a
stroke
of
paint
on
my
canvas
and
you
will
call
it
white
i
put
another
beside
it
and
by
contrast
the
first
appears
gray
still
another
and
the
second
has
become
gray
and
the
first
still
darker
and
so
on
until
i
have
reached
the
purest
white
we
know
it
is
the
same
with
humanity
men
are
only
dark
or
light
as
they
are
contrasted
with
others
nor
can
they
avoid
the
place
they
occupy
on
god
canvas
any
more
than
my
colors
can
choose
their
places
on
mine
the
world
is
a
great
picture
god
is
the
greatest
of
all
artists
his
is
the
master
hand
the
unerring
touch
that
lays
on
the
lights
the
and
the
shadows
each
fulfills
its
purpose
without
the
shadows
there
would
be
no
lights
what
is
true
of
masses
is
likewise
true
of
individuals
he
continued
after
a
moment
pause
in
a
landscape
every
blade
of
grass
every
pebble
has
its
light
and
its
dark
side
if
you
see
only
the
light
side
of
an
object
it
is
only
because
the
shadow
is
turned
from
you
it
is
so
with
men
one
side
is
sun
the
other
shadow
sometimes
the
light
only
is
presented
to
view
but
the
darker
side
is
none
the
less
there
because
unseen
nature
is
never
unbalanced
whatever
of
brightness
there
is
toward
the
sun
there
must
be
an
equal
amount
of
shadow
opposing
with
all
the
intergradations
between
if
the
light
is
dim
the
shadow
is
soft
if
the
light
is
brilliant
the
shadow
is
black
some
of
us
are
turned
white
side
to
the
world
some
the
reverse
some
show
the
white
and
the
black
alternately
the
man
in
the
chair
settled
himself
comfortably
to
listen
he
liked
nothing
better
than
to
see
the
artist
in
his
present
mood
offering
a
word
now
and
then
that
was
likely
to
draw
out
his
peculiar
ideas
you
believe
in
fate
then
and
the
absence
of
moral
freedom
he
said
reflectively
i
believe
nothing
belief
is
not
the
word
what
is
is
right
to
assert
otherwise
is
an
insult
to
the
supreme
he
is
all
powerful
hence
wrong
can
not
exist
i
should
be
glad
to
hear
your
argument
in
support
of
that
position
argument
it
is
a
truth
argument
is
not
necessary
argument
is
never
necessary
if
an
assertion
is
not
true
no
amount
of
discussion
will
make
it
so
while
the
truth
requires
no
support
the
other
had
lighted
a
pipe
and
was
smoking
lazily
well
he
said
as
the
artist
paused
at
least
those
who
have
crossed
over
have
solved
the
mystery
oh
they
have
and
how
do
you
know
that
anyone
has
crossed
over
you
do
not
believe
in
the
mortality
nor
the
slumber
of
the
soul
no
more
do
i
but
time
exists
only
with
life
a
man
dies
and
in
the
same
instant
opens
his
eyes
upon
eternity
and
yet
a
million
of
years
may
have
been
swept
away
in
that
instant
as
a
tired
child
you
have
fallen
asleep
a
moment
later
you
have
been
called
by
your
mother
to
breakfast
and
yet
in
that
moment
of
dreamless
sleep
the
long
winter
night
had
passed
adam
the
first
man
closing
his
eyes
in
death
you
and
i
who
will
do
the
same
ten
twenty
forty
years
hence
and
the
generations
who
will
follow
us
for
a
million
years
perhaps
will
waken
to
eternity
if
there
be
a
waking
in
one
and
the
same
instant
of
time
without
a
knowledge
of
the
intervening
years
there
were
no
years
eternity
has
no
beginning
no
end
no
measurement
he
paused
a
moment
then
suddenly
burst
out
again
nothing
in
life
is
real
it
is
all
a
dream
you
think
your
being
is
reality
and
that
you
hear
my
voice
speaking
i
tell
you
it
is
but
fancy
we
are
the
figures
the
mimes
in
some
vast
hypnotic
exhibition
the
shadows
in
some
gigantic
spirit
disordered
dream
hypnotism
he
continued
pursuing
a
line
of
thought
which
his
impulsive
words
had
suggested
has
in
fact
proven
that
no
one
can
distinguish
the
real
from
the
unreal
you
remember
when
we
went
to
see
flint
the
great
hypnotist
how
his
subjects
passed
from
one
condition
to
another
and
took
on
any
personality
at
the
operator
will
capering
and
grimacing
about
the
stage
with
all
the
characteristics
and
even
the
facial
expression
of
monkeys
one
minute
and
simpering
as
silly
the
next
and
to
them
it
was
all
real
as
real
as
this
room
these
bodies
these
pictures
are
to
us
i
read
some
lines
once
that
seemed
to
express
the
idea
i
sometimes
think
life
but
a
dream
of
some
great
soul
in
some
great
sphere
and
what
appear
as
truths
but
seem
and
what
seem
truths
do
but
appear
he
repeated
these
words
with
slow
earnestness
adding
solemnly
who
knows
who
knows
the
man
who
sat
listening
drew
a
long
breath
he
was
a
rich
idler
with
a
good
deal
of
worldly
wisdom
but
he
loved
and
admired
his
erratic
friend
he
felt
that
much
of
what
he
said
was
sophistry
wholly
or
in
part
but
there
was
a
charm
about
the
earnest
manner
the
musical
voice
and
the
flashing
brevity
of
statement
more
pleasing
to
his
ear
than
sounder
logic
from
a
surer
reasoner
it
was
nearly
dark
now
in
the
studio
the
artist
halted
in
his
march
and
offered
to
light
the
gas
not
for
the
world
julian
i
am
far
too
happy
in
the
dark
i
was
just
thinking
what
a
glorious
agitator
you
would
make
you
would
carry
all
before
you
i
wonder
you
have
never
dabbled
in
politics
or
socialism
now
i
think
of
it
i
have
never
heard
you
mention
these
things
i
suppose
you
belong
to
one
or
the
other
of
the
great
parties
however
politics
party
good
heavens
no
i
never
meddle
with
such
things
it
is
one
step
lower
than
i
have
ever
gone
but
a
man
must
stand
somewhere
he
that
stands
nowhere
stands
upon
nothing
the
artist
paused
before
the
open
window
and
stood
looking
out
upon
the
dusk
of
the
little
scented
garden
a
faint
reflected
glimmer
from
some
lamp
dimly
illuminated
one
side
of
his
face
silhouetting
his
striking
profile
sharply
against
a
ground
of
blackness
if
you
mean
he
began
slowly
that
i
should
have
some
opinions
then
i
will
tell
you
what
they
are
i
believe
neither
in
tariff
nor
trade
currency
nor
coin
traffic
nor
toil
i
believe
in
but
the
absolute
freedom
of
every
living
being
freedom
freedom
from
the
curse
of
creeds
the
blight
of
bigotry
and
the
leprosy
of
the
law
freedom
to
go
and
to
come
to
live
and
to
die
life
without
loathing
love
without
bondage
to
live
in
some
sunlit
valley
where
the
bud
is
ever
bursting
into
flower
the
flower
fading
to
fruit
and
the
fruit
ripening
to
sustenance
the
untouched
bosom
of
nature
would
yield
enough
for
her
children
had
not
the
curse
of
greed
been
implanted
in
their
bosoms
goetze
had
turned
away
from
the
window
and
was
again
striding
up
and
down
the
floor
in
the
dark
a
beautiful
poem
julian
said
the
other
dreamily
but
a
sort
of
delightful
barbarism
i
afraid
barbarism
no
a
higher
purer
intellectuality
than
we
have
ever
yet
known
a
civilization
that
knows
not
the
curse
of
avarice
nor
the
miseries
of
crime
the
weariness
of
wealth
nor
the
pangs
of
poverty
the
garden
of
eden
is
still
about
us
but
we
have
torn
up
the
flowers
and
desecrated
it
with
the
lust
of
gain
man
was
never
driven
out
of
that
garden
greed
was
planted
in
his
heart
and
he
destroyed
it
come
he
continued
suddenly
changing
the
subject
i
have
made
you
tired
and
hungry
let
us
go
out
somewhere
to
supper
thanks
said
the
other
laughing
i
supposed
a
man
in
your
condition
had
no
need
of
bodily
sustenance
you
are
comfortably
situated
here
julian
he
added
as
they
passed
out
into
the
street
yes
it
is
quiet
here
no
bother
with
servants
nor
landladies
once
a
week
my
washerwoman
comes
and
stays
to
put
my
establishment
in
order
the
rest
of
the
time
i
am
disturbed
only
by
my
sitters
you
forget
yes
harry
said
the
artist
taking
his
arm
affectionately
and
by
you
of
course
iv
when
julian
goetze
arose
the
next
morning
he
felt
strong
within
himself
to
withstand
and
conquer
those
fierce
impulses
of
his
savage
heritage
that
had
answered
to
the
blandishments
of
evelin
march
and
yet
he
was
greatly
troubled
he
felt
that
in
a
large
measure
he
had
been
to
blame
he
blushed
hotly
as
he
recalled
some
of
the
things
he
had
said
to
this
woman
whom
harry
had
called
a
siren
men
are
all
scoundrels
he
said
savagely
i
wonder
if
there
are
really
any
who
are
not
so
at
heart
he
rapidly
formulated
his
plan
of
action
and
even
the
sentences
with
which
he
was
to
meet
and
conquer
this
modern
circe
i
will
keep
eva
face
before
me
he
thought
and
i
will
treat
her
coldly
she
is
and
keen
she
will
notice
the
change
at
once
and
resent
it
she
is
too
proud
to
demand
an
explanation
he
felt
himself
equal
to
the
ordeal
he
was
anxious
now
for
her
to
come
that
it
might
be
safely
passed
as
the
hours
went
by
he
grew
impatient
he
placed
her
portrait
on
the
easel
and
fancied
the
original
was
before
him
he
went
through
an
imaginary
dialogue
with
it
in
which
he
was
wholly
victorious
he
no
longer
felt
any
emotion
for
this
woman
i
will
begin
a
new
life
he
said
as
he
strode
rapidly
up
and
down
the
room
a
new
life
but
there
was
a
feverishness
in
his
voice
that
did
not
bode
well
for
his
resolution
i
wish
she
would
come
he
muttered
fretfully
his
cheeks
were
hot
and
flushed
and
his
hands
were
like
ice
and
trembling
and
the
result
was
that
he
failed
failed
miserably
and
completely
when
an
hour
later
evelin
march
entered
the
studio
and
throwing
off
her
wrap
stood
before
him
imperious
soulless
and
beautiful
a
delicate
odor
as
of
pansies
from
her
white
flesh
stealing
into
his
brain
his
pledges
of
faith
and
his
fair
resolves
melted
away
like
walls
of
mist
and
the
face
of
eva
delorme
shrank
back
into
the
silent
recesses
of
his
heart
and
only
a
small
voice
within
him
whispered
coward
traitor
she
glanced
at
him
sharply
something
troubles
you
you
are
not
overjoyed
at
my
coming
i
have
been
fancying
to
myself
how
impatiently
you
were
waiting
his
hands
were
no
longer
trembling
he
was
calm
enough
now
but
it
was
the
calmness
of
defeat
of
having
yielded
to
the
inevitable
i
have
indeed
been
waiting
impatiently
he
said
smiling
you
see
that
i
have
been
even
consoling
myself
with
your
picture
and
he
pointed
to
the
easel
from
an
artistic
point
of
view
only
i
fancy
that
is
unkind
i
have
been
holding
a
conversation
with
it
that
i
fear
i
should
hesitate
to
repeat
with
the
original
how
interesting
a
rehearsal
perhaps
perhaps
and
i
was
testing
the
powers
of
my
work
as
compared
to
those
of
the
original
and
with
the
result
that
my
work
is
a
failure
how
humiliating
may
i
ask
in
what
way
i
could
withstand
the
charms
of
the
picture
but
with
the
original
well
and
with
the
original
i
failed
the
face
before
him
was
radiant
but
down
in
his
heart
the
small
voice
growing
very
faint
still
whispered
coward
traitor
fool
that
evening
harry
lawton
found
him
sitting
gloomily
before
the
window
looking
out
upon
the
shadows
that
were
gathering
in
the
little
garden
beneath
as
the
door
opened
he
glanced
up
and
nodded
without
speaking
circe
came
again
the
artist
nodded
and
conquered
another
nod
did
you
suppose
for
a
moment
that
she
would
no
answer
lawton
assumed
a
dignified
attitude
and
began
with
mock
earnestness
oh
wise
man
thou
who
knowest
so
well
the
heart
and
the
face
of
nature
how
little
thou
knowest
of
thine
own
soul
a
shade
of
anguish
swept
over
the
artist
face
but
he
made
no
reply
most
gentle
and
gifted
man
last
night
i
listened
long
and
patiently
to
the
scintillating
wisdom
of
your
wonderful
brain
let
me
now
speak
while
you
in
turn
give
ear
when
last
night
you
showed
me
the
portraits
and
told
me
their
history
i
foresaw
this
moment
you
are
plunged
into
despair
at
the
contemplation
of
your
own
weakness
you
have
been
abusing
your
soul
with
hard
names
now
i
would
whisper
to
you
with
great
gentleness
that
what
you
observed
to
me
last
night
about
the
sunlight
and
shadow
of
every
life
is
true
and
that
the
brightness
of
the
sun
can
not
illuminate
but
only
intensifies
the
blackness
of
the
shade
pursuing
the
same
line
of
reasoning
i
add
that
flowers
bloom
in
the
sunlight
while
mushrooms
thrive
in
the
darkness
that
because
man
is
fond
of
mushrooms
is
no
reason
why
he
should
be
deprived
of
flowers
that
because
your
purer
and
spiritual
self
reaches
out
for
the
stainless
lily
is
no
reason
why
your
material
and
grosser
nature
should
be
left
starving
because
you
are
for
a
time
intoxicated
with
evelin
march
is
no
reason
why
in
your
calmer
and
nobler
existence
you
should
not
love
truly
and
sinlessly
eva
delorme
i
am
aware
that
my
logic
is
not
wholly
in
accord
with
generally
accepted
theory
it
accords
much
more
nearly
perhaps
with
universal
practice
of
course
i
refer
only
to
men
in
the
single
walks
of
life
it
is
well
known
that
all
men
after
marriage
are
irreproachable
and
when
you
have
plucked
your
stainless
lily
you
like
the
rest
will
subsist
only
upon
its
fragrance
but
really
for
the
present
i
can
not
see
that
your
affair
with
miss
march
in
any
way
conflicts
with
your
sentiments
for
miss
delorme
and
especially
as
you
have
known
the
latter
but
a
few
hours
in
all
hardly
sufficient
i
should
think
to
inspire
a
lifelong
devotion
truly
julian
i
would
advise
you
not
to
take
matters
quite
so
seriously
and
let
the
tide
drift
as
it
will
for
the
present
throughout
this
long
harangue
julian
goetze
had
listened
in
silence
oh
harry
he
groaned
as
the
other
paused
you
do
know
what
a
traitor
i
am
well
possibly
my
sensibilities
are
not
over
fine
but
i
think
you
will
be
more
comfortable
for
taking
my
advice
without
replying
the
artist
rose
and
going
into
the
adjoining
room
returned
a
moment
later
with
a
decanter
and
glasses
i
am
tired
he
said
apologetically
as
he
caught
the
look
of
disapproval
in
his
friend
eye
it
will
do
me
good
none
for
me
julian
before
supper
and
i
do
think
if
if
i
were
you
i
would
take
any
either
i
am
exhausted
harry
i
am
not
going
to
supper
and
i
need
it
he
said
fretfully
the
other
sighed
and
did
not
reply
goetze
filled
one
of
the
glasses
and
drank
it
off
then
he
resumed
his
seat
by
the
window
a
little
later
his
friend
took
leave
of
him
reaching
the
street
door
he
hesitated
as
if
about
to
turn
back
then
he
lifted
the
latch
and
passed
slowly
out
into
the
lighted
street
closing
the
door
gently
behind
him
the
next
morning
the
studio
of
julian
goetze
was
locked
it
remained
locked
all
day
and
within
stretched
upon
the
floor
unconscious
lay
the
gifted
man
and
by
his
side
was
an
empty
flask
perhaps
julian
goetze
did
not
willingly
abide
by
the
somewhat
fallacious
reasoning
of
his
friend
it
is
more
than
probable
that
each
time
he
succumbed
to
the
savage
elements
of
his
nature
he
did
so
with
reluctance
and
shame
with
subsequent
remorse
and
good
resolutions
formed
a
score
of
times
perhaps
to
be
as
often
broken
as
the
weeks
went
by
he
became
more
and
more
involved
in
this
singular
affair
in
a
way
he
had
found
it
possible
as
his
friend
had
once
suggested
to
be
in
love
with
two
women
at
one
time
when
he
was
with
eva
delorme
his
love
for
the
pure
beautiful
girl
seemed
to
take
entire
possession
of
his
life
evelin
march
for
the
time
was
as
hateful
to
him
as
his
own
weakness
or
was
wholly
forgotten
when
in
the
presence
of
evelin
march
his
better
self
shrank
away
before
the
fierce
heredity
within
him
and
the
face
of
eva
delorme
became
only
a
dim
haunting
ghost
that
taunted
him
with
his
treachery
of
the
lives
of
these
two
he
knew
absolutely
nothing
the
evident
distress
which
his
reference
to
relatives
and
friends
had
occasioned
eva
during
their
first
meeting
had
caused
him
carefully
to
avoid
the
subject
afterward
and
the
other
who
had
never
referred
to
her
family
he
had
not
cared
to
know
he
had
never
even
considered
whether
she
was
wife
maid
or
widow
until
he
suddenly
became
aware
that
the
sentiment
he
had
awakened
within
her
was
not
as
he
had
at
first
supposed
a
passing
fancy
but
a
fierce
passion
of
jealous
and
tyrannical
love
she
no
longer
rallied
him
and
parried
his
compliments
with
her
light
pointed
sarcasm
as
she
had
done
at
first
but
assumed
an
unmistakable
bearing
of
ownership
and
possession
questioning
him
closely
regarding
other
sitters
and
female
acquaintances
while
he
writhed
helplessly
in
the
exquisite
misery
of
a
spell
which
he
felt
himself
powerless
to
break
thus
far
he
had
never
surrendered
himself
entirely
to
this
passion
more
than
once
he
had
hesitated
on
the
very
brink
of
the
precipice
whether
it
was
the
haunting
face
of
eva
delorme
that
stayed
him
or
something
in
the
manner
of
the
other
he
could
not
tell
one
day
he
suddenly
caught
her
in
his
arms
she
suffered
his
embrace
for
a
moment
then
drew
away
from
him
when
we
are
married
paul
she
said
tenderly
i
will
take
you
to
italy
where
in
some
beautiful
villa
we
will
give
ourselves
up
wholly
to
our
love
i
am
rich
paul
rich
and
it
is
all
yours
but
we
must
wait
he
turned
white
and
was
silent
the
thought
of
marriage
with
this
woman
had
never
entered
his
head
he
had
already
asked
eva
delorme
to
be
his
wife
she
had
long
since
confessed
her
love
for
him
but
had
deferred
her
answer
from
week
to
week
and
with
such
evident
distress
of
mind
that
the
young
artist
felt
that
a
secret
sorrow
lay
heavily
upon
her
life
he
longed
to
fly
with
her
to
some
far
country
away
from
it
all
and
from
the
dark
shadows
that
encompassed
his
own
the
similarity
of
features
which
he
had
at
first
noticed
in
his
two
sitters
was
at
times
almost
forgotten
at
others
it
had
recurred
to
him
and
haunted
him
like
a
nightmare
more
than
once
he
had
imagined
he
saw
the
fleeting
something
in
one
woman
that
reminded
him
of
the
other
he
had
dallied
over
the
portraits
making
them
photographically
minute
for
comparison
he
had
hesitated
guiltily
about
showing
either
of
these
to
the
other
woman
he
had
sometimes
longed
and
always
dreaded
to
see
them
side
by
side
in
person
they
did
not
always
come
at
their
appointed
time
and
he
was
in
constant
terror
lest
they
should
meet
in
the
studio
and
yet
the
thought
had
in
it
a
fascination
for
him
that
made
him
feverish
for
its
realization
it
was
strange
that
they
had
never
met
in
his
rooms
he
did
not
realize
perhaps
how
strange
as
the
months
slipped
away
and
he
had
become
more
and
more
distracted
by
the
contending
forces
that
were
eating
deeply
into
his
life
he
had
grown
almost
indifferent
to
his
curiosity
and
only
dreaded
their
meeting
it
was
now
october
the
portraits
had
been
practically
finished
long
since
day
after
day
he
had
resolved
to
send
that
of
evelin
march
to
the
dealer
for
framing
he
felt
that
he
could
then
break
away
from
her
but
still
he
had
hesitated
and
lingered
and
now
when
in
a
moment
of
recklessness
he
had
taken
a
step
nearer
the
brink
of
the
precipice
she
had
spoken
to
him
of
their
marriage
the
idea
stunned
him
he
could
not
reply
she
believed
his
emotion
had
been
caused
by
her
rebuff
and
laid
her
hand
gently
on
his
arm
do
be
angry
paul
she
whispered
he
had
never
seen
her
so
subdued
and
beautiful
as
she
was
at
that
moment
he
was
nearer
to
loving
her
than
he
had
ever
been
yes
he
said
with
some
agitation
we
must
wait
that
night
after
supper
he
sought
harry
lawton
and
unburdened
himself
what
shall
i
do
harry
he
said
piteously
what
i
do
marry
eva
delorme
and
take
a
year
trip
to
europe
but
eva
hesitates
she
has
never
yet
given
me
a
decided
answer
insist
upon
it
then
take
her
to
the
preacher
at
once
and
fly
oh
harry
what
a
villain
i
am
evelin
is
really
in
love
with
me
and
i
have
given
her
just
cause
i
never
saw
her
look
as
she
did
nonsense
she
is
a
schemer
and
an
actress
i
did
not
suppose
she
wanted
to
marry
you
but
since
that
is
her
idea
i
can
see
right
through
her
this
being
the
case
and
your
determination
to
marry
the
other
fixed
the
sooner
you
do
it
and
get
away
the
better
i
am
afraid
you
are
right
harry
there
seems
to
be
no
other
course
i
have
the
moral
courage
to
tell
her
the
truth
no
need
of
it
whatever
it
would
help
matters
in
the
least
just
marry
and
go
away
quietly
and
do
return
until
you
get
ready
if
you
need
money
draw
on
me
at
sight
thank
you
harry
i
expect
eva
soon
i
am
going
to
put
the
final
touches
on
her
picture
and
i
will
urge
my
suit
if
she
accepts
me
i
will
take
her
away
at
once
evelin
picture
is
ready
for
framing
i
will
send
it
to
the
dealer
i
wish
to
god
i
could
get
away
before
she
comes
again
why
not
you
have
nothing
to
keep
you
if
the
girl
really
loves
you
she
will
marry
you
out
of
hand
and
be
only
too
glad
to
cut
loose
from
all
unpleasant
associations
and
now
let
take
a
last
look
at
the
pictures
he
said
they
had
been
walking
slowly
in
the
direction
of
goetze
cottage
they
entered
now
and
the
artist
lighted
the
gas
then
he
arranged
the
portraits
of
the
two
women
as
he
had
done
for
his
friend
inspection
nearly
a
previous
both
were
thinking
of
that
evening
now
how
long
ago
it
seemed
harry
sat
silent
before
them
for
a
long
time
they
are
wonderful
portraits
goetze
he
said
at
length
but
do
you
know
it
does
seem
to
me
that
they
have
quite
the
artistic
value
of
the
first
sketches
you
are
right
harry
they
are
too
minute
i
shall
destroy
some
of
that
the
other
was
silent
after
a
long
pause
he
said
thoughtfully
there
something
i
ca
tell
where
it
is
either
but
it
is
certainly
there
you
refer
to
the
resemblance
yes
it
is
hardly
that
however
i
have
thought
very
little
about
it
lately
it
troubled
me
terribly
for
a
while
well
julian
said
lawton
rising
if
there
are
to
be
any
i
suppose
i
am
best
man
yes
harry
two
days
later
when
eva
delorme
came
to
the
studio
the
artist
thought
he
had
never
seen
her
so
beautiful
and
now
the
whiteness
of
his
own
soul
was
turned
to
view
he
resembled
as
little
the
man
who
had
trembled
before
evelin
march
as
evelin
march
was
like
this
beautiful
being
before
him
with
all
the
ardor
and
fervid
eloquence
of
his
nature
he
urged
his
suit
and
she
tearful
and
trembling
before
him
half
consented
he
caught
her
to
his
breast
and
covered
her
face
with
kisses
my
darling
my
darling
he
murmured
we
will
leave
this
smoky
dingy
city
i
will
take
you
to
a
beautiful
land
where
the
flowers
never
fade
and
the
air
is
forever
filled
with
their
fragrance
where
the
blue
skies
of
an
eternal
summer
are
above
us
and
the
blue
waves
of
a
whispering
sea
shall
lull
us
to
peace
there
is
a
tiny
island
in
the
mediterranean
on
the
coast
of
france
i
was
there
once
it
is
like
heaven
i
will
take
you
there
say
that
you
will
go
sweetheart
we
will
start
the
girl
lifted
her
face
to
his
and
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
it
would
be
heaven
indeed
julian
but
we
must
wait
the
artist
started
and
grew
pale
her
final
words
had
been
the
same
as
those
used
by
evelin
march
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
his
emotion
or
mistook
its
cause
you
know
that
i
love
you
julian
she
continued
and
i
will
do
anything
for
your
happiness
but
oh
julian
she
burst
into
tears
and
hid
her
face
on
his
shoulder
he
felt
that
some
mystery
of
grief
weighed
upon
her
and
he
longed
to
urge
her
confidence
but
refrained
he
soothed
her
gently
with
tender
words
and
caresses
by
and
by
she
grew
calm
julian
she
said
i
am
in
no
condition
to
give
you
a
sitting
i
will
come
and
then
i
will
give
you
a
final
answer
and
oh
my
love
do
not
urge
me
further
i
i
can
not
endure
it
then
suddenly
throwing
her
arms
about
his
neck
she
pressed
one
fierce
kiss
upon
his
lips
and
hurried
from
the
room
after
she
was
gone
the
artist
walked
up
and
down
the
studio
for
a
long
time
in
deep
thought
he
was
wildly
happy
in
her
love
and
yet
he
was
troubled
it
was
strange
that
her
words
should
have
been
the
same
as
those
of
evelin
march
her
manner
too
during
the
last
moment
had
been
unusual
something
about
it
had
jarred
him
almost
reminded
him
of
the
other
woman
what
was
it
between
these
two
by
and
by
he
noticed
something
white
lying
on
the
floor
it
was
a
woman
handkerchief
a
bit
of
cambric
and
lace
exhaling
the
delicate
odor
of
violets
he
pressed
it
to
his
lips
repeatedly
and
whispered
her
name
over
and
over
then
hid
it
away
in
his
bosom
he
had
not
noticed
in
the
dim
light
that
in
one
corner
in
small
delicate
letters
were
the
initials
vi
the
next
morning
was
bright
and
crisp
and
the
artist
felt
better
than
he
had
for
many
weeks
he
arose
happy
in
the
thought
that
he
should
again
see
eva
delorme
so
soon
and
in
the
confidence
that
she
would
accept
his
offer
of
marriage
he
was
happier
still
in
the
prospect
of
cutting
free
from
all
the
feverish
torture
of
the
past
few
months
of
leaving
behind
all
the
unpleasant
associations
that
clouded
both
their
lives
along
with
the
soot
and
fumes
and
temptations
of
this
grimy
city
and
of
dreaming
away
the
winter
with
eva
on
the
coast
of
france
he
rose
early
and
set
out
for
a
morning
walk
his
favorite
restaurant
was
near
the
heart
of
the
city
he
would
go
there
for
breakfast
the
distance
was
considerable
but
the
brisk
exercise
was
in
harmony
with
his
thoughts
the
blood
was
circulating
rhythmically
through
his
veins
he
threw
back
his
shoulders
and
breathed
in
the
fresh
frosty
air
he
wanted
to
sing
in
another
week
he
would
be
away
from
all
that
was
disagreeable
and
disgraceful
perhaps
they
would
spend
a
whole
year
in
europe
may
be
they
would
not
come
back
at
all
after
breakfast
he
met
two
or
three
acquaintances
they
remarked
his
unusual
spirits
you
must
have
made
a
big
strike
goetze
ca
you
tell
us
yes
by
and
by
not
now
later
congratulations
are
in
order
of
course
hardly
yet
pretty
soon
he
returned
to
his
studio
eva
had
named
no
hour
but
he
hoped
she
would
come
early
as
he
opened
the
street
door
he
saw
a
long
thin
delicately
tinted
envelope
that
had
been
pushed
beneath
it
in
his
absence
he
knew
instinctively
that
it
was
from
eva
and
hastened
into
the
studio
to
read
it
it
was
not
sealed
and
there
was
no
address
trembling
with
agitation
he
tore
off
the
covering
and
read
dearest
julian
i
am
feeling
badly
this
morning
so
will
not
come
for
my
sitting
and
since
my
portrait
is
so
nearly
finished
i
suppose
there
is
really
no
need
of
my
coming
again
for
that
purpose
i
should
have
come
however
as
i
promised
had
it
been
possible
and
now
my
dear
friend
as
regards
the
decision
which
so
concerns
us
both
i
will
ask
your
kind
patience
until
eve
on
west
l
street
between
and
near
the
park
there
is
a
large
brick
mansion
it
is
no
east
side
you
can
not
miss
it
there
is
an
arc
electric
light
directly
in
front
of
it
go
to
this
place
night
exactly
at
six
if
the
door
is
fastened
ring
and
the
servant
will
admit
you
there
wait
in
the
until
i
come
if
the
door
is
unlocked
enter
and
wait
likewise
unless
i
am
already
within
to
meet
you
then
i
will
give
you
my
answer
and
oh
my
friend
if
it
be
possible
i
will
unfold
to
you
the
history
and
sad
mystery
of
my
poor
life
which
you
have
so
kindly
never
sought
to
know
eva
julian
read
this
note
again
and
again
now
with
pleasure
again
with
anxiety
surely
she
meant
to
accept
him
or
she
would
not
have
written
thus
she
would
not
have
appointed
a
meeting
with
him
at
this
old
mansion
and
why
at
this
old
mansion
was
it
her
home
no
that
was
not
likely
or
why
was
he
to
wait
until
she
came
if
her
home
she
would
be
waiting
there
for
him
probably
the
home
of
some
friend
of
whom
she
had
made
a
confidant
and
who
was
in
sympathy
with
her
love
affair
yes
it
must
be
this
and
the
mystery
of
her
life
what
could
that
be
but
some
pledge
of
marriage
with
one
whom
she
despised
or
tyrannical
guardians
or
both
she
would
probably
be
disinherited
if
she
disobeyed
what
did
he
care
money
was
not
the
end
of
god
judgment
he
would
take
her
away
from
it
all
his
precious
darling
and
she
was
ill
too
she
was
in
pain
and
he
could
not
go
to
her
he
longed
to
sit
by
her
side
and
hold
her
hand
and
pour
out
his
love
he
was
bitterly
disappointed
at
not
seeing
her
but
he
almost
forgot
that
now
as
he
thought
of
her
ill
and
suffering
he
read
and
the
lines
of
her
letter
and
tried
to
comfort
himself
with
the
thought
that
it
was
no
more
than
a
headache
brought
on
by
her
mental
strain
by
and
by
something
else
about
this
letter
began
to
puzzle
him
he
had
not
thought
of
it
at
first
but
gradually
it
dawned
upon
him
that
the
handwriting
was
not
exactly
like
that
upon
the
card
of
eva
delorme
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
less
delicate
and
more
irregular
he
took
her
card
from
the
little
tray
on
the
table
and
compared
them
he
decided
that
they
were
the
same
after
all
the
letter
was
written
hurriedly
and
she
was
ill
but
the
formation
of
the
characters
was
much
the
same
as
he
replaced
the
card
his
eye
fell
upon
that
of
evelin
march
there
was
no
similarity
between
the
writing
on
the
two
cards
but
as
he
glanced
now
from
that
of
evelin
march
to
the
letter
he
fancied
one
suggested
faintly
the
nervous
dashing
style
of
the
other
the
haunting
curiosity
that
had
once
possessed
him
returned
for
a
moment
there
was
a
strange
fear
in
his
heart
which
he
could
not
name
he
compared
the
two
more
closely
and
as
he
did
so
the
fancy
disappeared
it
was
like
certain
faint
odors
that
are
only
perceptible
at
a
distance
he
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
i
am
a
consummate
ass
among
other
things
he
muttered
his
mind
reverted
to
eva
how
would
he
get
through
the
time
until
there
would
be
a
sitting
with
evelin
as
he
thought
of
her
his
face
flushed
with
shame
and
a
feeling
of
dread
came
upon
him
he
would
send
her
portrait
to
the
dealer
it
was
finished
then
there
would
be
no
excuse
for
her
staying
no
he
would
go
away
and
lock
the
studio
all
day
what
a
fool
he
had
been
to
allow
himself
to
be
fascinated
by
her
dashing
beauty
what
a
traitor
he
had
been
to
make
even
a
semblance
of
love
to
this
bold
flashy
woman
of
the
world
a
woman
who
until
recently
had
not
even
commanded
his
respect
i
have
been
a
villain
he
muttered
to
himself
a
villain
and
a
traitor
but
i
will
be
so
no
more
i
will
curb
this
savage
nature
within
me
i
will
abstain
from
drink
i
will
be
a
new
man
he
sealed
his
resolution
with
a
kiss
pressed
upon
the
little
tinted
letter
then
placing
it
in
an
inner
pocket
he
arranged
the
canvas
of
eva
delorme
on
the
easel
before
him
and
walked
backward
and
forward
in
front
of
it
thinking
pausing
now
and
then
to
gaze
long
upon
the
beautiful
saintly
features
it
does
not
do
her
justice
he
said
at
last
there
is
something
about
the
lips
and
the
expression
that
i
have
not
caught
it
is
too
minute
i
must
darken
the
ground
there
is
not
enough
relief
not
enough
depth
hastily
removing
his
coat
and
the
wide
felt
hat
which
he
always
wore
on
the
street
he
hung
them
on
a
rack
in
the
adjoining
room
and
donning
his
velvet
studio
jacket
returned
to
the
easel
seizing
his
palette
and
brushes
he
fell
to
work
rapidly
and
with
the
enthusiasm
of
one
who
is
in
love
with
his
task
as
he
dashed
on
the
broad
sweeps
of
color
from
his
palette
the
background
gradually
assumed
the
effect
of
having
faded
away
and
the
rare
face
before
it
to
have
become
a
thing
of
flesh
and
blood
it
was
a
marvel
of
skill
he
had
never
done
anything
like
this
before
he
became
so
absorbed
in
his
work
that
he
forgot
the
passing
hours
the
background
of
the
portrait
complete
he
began
adding
touches
of
light
and
shadow
and
color
to
the
drapery
to
the
hair
to
the
perfect
features
he
felt
that
he
had
never
painted
half
so
well
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
inspired
he
remembered
the
story
of
the
artist
who
had
painted
the
portrait
of
his
beloved
drawing
the
tints
so
truly
from
her
life
that
when
he
had
finished
and
turned
to
look
at
her
with
an
exclamation
of
triumph
on
his
lips
she
was
dead
it
seemed
to
him
at
this
moment
that
he
was
drawing
his
tints
from
her
very
life
that
the
intense
workings
of
his
brain
must
in
some
manner
affect
her
own
he
paused
and
his
hand
trembled
she
was
ill
what
if
she
were
to
die
pshaw
it
was
but
a
fable
he
would
paint
the
picture
as
truly
but
only
that
the
world
might
bow
before
the
beauty
of
his
mistress
he
would
exhibit
it
in
paris
and
the
multitude
would
worship
the
beautiful
face
that
should
win
him
a
fame
then
he
would
take
it
away
from
the
gaping
throng
and
lay
it
with
the
fame
it
brought
him
at
her
feet
the
little
clock
on
the
mantel
had
long
since
chimed
noon
and
the
hour
hand
had
crept
around
the
circle
nearly
to
five
before
he
finally
laid
aside
his
brushes
and
palette
and
stepped
back
to
view
his
finished
work
it
is
wonderful
wonderful
he
said
aloud
oh
my
precious
darling
there
was
a
sound
behind
him
as
of
some
one
choking
he
turned
and
stood
face
to
face
with
evelin
march
she
was
very
pale
and
her
eyes
burned
like
two
stars
who
is
that
woman
she
said
fiercely
he
knew
that
she
had
overheard
him
but
he
endeavored
to
address
her
calmly
he
felt
the
cowardliness
of
his
nature
rising
and
he
cursed
himself
inwardly
i
i
was
not
expecting
you
evelin
he
stammered
you
know
is
the
day
for
your
sitting
she
did
not
take
her
eyes
from
the
portrait
she
had
gone
very
close
to
it
and
as
she
turned
upon
him
to
reply
there
was
a
mingled
look
of
terror
and
ferocity
in
her
face
no
it
is
quite
evident
that
you
did
not
expect
me
and
that
you
were
too
much
absorbed
to
remember
or
care
when
my
sitting
was
due
and
now
you
will
please
to
answer
my
question
is
that
woman
what
would
he
not
have
given
at
that
moment
to
have
had
courage
to
say
she
is
to
be
my
wife
but
the
magnificent
fury
of
the
woman
before
him
and
the
recollection
of
the
shameful
words
of
love
he
had
spoken
to
her
overwhelmed
him
she
is
a
a
miss
delorme
i
believe
a
sitter
of
mine
he
managed
to
say
at
last
you
believe
you
lie
you
know
who
she
is
and
you
love
her
you
love
that
baby
i
heard
your
words
you
believe
you
evelin
stop
do
speak
to
me
you
traitor
precious
darling
oh
i
could
kill
her
i
kill
her
he
could
not
understand
this
wild
fury
that
seemed
to
be
half
inspired
by
a
sort
of
terror
she
had
turned
to
the
portrait
again
and
was
examining
it
oblivious
for
the
moment
to
all
else
then
suddenly
she
turned
upon
him
again
with
blazing
eyes
i
will
kill
her
she
hissed
i
could
kill
her
with
and
she
pointed
to
the
jeweled
stiletto
on
the
wall
she
was
so
magnificent
in
her
rage
that
he
could
not
help
admiring
her
through
it
all
the
love
for
him
which
had
aroused
this
tempest
was
so
fierce
that
he
felt
his
savage
blood
beginning
to
throb
with
an
answering
glow
he
felt
that
once
more
he
was
about
to
be
a
traitor
to
all
that
was
good
within
him
the
ground
was
slipping
from
under
his
feet
the
glamour
of
her
voluptuous
beauty
was
ruling
his
brain
like
the
fumes
of
liquor
his
eyes
too
were
beginning
to
shine
fiercely
but
not
with
anger
evelin
he
said
listen
you
know
i
love
you
and
have
from
the
first
she
is
nothing
to
me
the
words
that
you
overheard
were
addressed
only
to
the
picture
it
is
my
masterpiece
i
was
not
thinking
of
the
original
and
down
in
his
heart
the
small
voice
was
whispering
coward
traitor
fool
but
the
hot
blood
of
passion
was
sweeping
through
his
veins
and
he
heeded
it
not
he
put
out
his
hand
and
laid
it
upon
her
arm
do
touch
me
she
said
angrily
but
the
expression
in
her
eyes
softened
he
saw
his
advantage
and
followed
it
up
evelin
he
said
huskily
i
love
you
i
love
you
again
he
laid
his
hand
upon
her
and
this
time
she
allowed
it
to
remain
they
were
standing
near
the
curtained
arch
of
the
adjoining
room
he
parted
back
the
heavy
draperies
and
gently
drew
her
within
the
savage
blood
was
rioting
fiercely
within
him
he
caught
both
her
hands
in
his
and
drew
her
to
his
embrace
she
hid
her
face
upon
his
shoulder
and
would
not
let
him
touch
her
lips
other
than
this
she
made
no
further
resistance
half
dragging
and
half
carrying
her
he
approached
a
large
divan
that
stood
in
a
little
alcove
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
suddenly
he
took
her
bodily
in
his
arms
and
they
sank
down
upon
it
together
for
a
second
only
then
with
a
quick
powerful
effort
she
threw
him
backward
and
sprang
to
her
feet
staring
about
her
with
a
wild
startled
look
in
her
eyes
goetze
wholly
at
a
loss
to
account
for
the
suddenness
and
fierceness
of
the
resistance
was
for
a
moment
stunned
as
he
recovered
himself
and
made
a
movement
toward
her
she
gave
him
one
quick
piteous
look
a
look
that
recalled
to
him
suddenly
and
strangely
the
beautiful
innocent
girl
whom
he
had
wronged
and
forgotten
the
of
eva
then
as
if
seized
with
sudden
panic
she
sped
from
the
room
out
through
the
dim
studio
and
into
the
dusky
beyond
he
heard
the
opening
and
closing
of
the
outside
door
and
knew
that
she
was
gone
then
the
tide
of
reaction
swept
over
him
the
glamour
of
conquest
had
passed
and
there
remained
only
the
shame
the
treachery
and
the
remorse
with
a
curse
of
anguish
he
flung
himself
down
upon
the
floor
and
lay
groveling
with
his
face
in
the
dust
the
moments
flew
by
unheeded
an
hour
passed
the
electric
lamps
were
turned
on
and
a
white
ray
of
light
shot
in
through
the
window
the
little
clock
on
the
mantel
chimed
the
hour
the
sound
roused
him
starting
to
his
feet
he
gazed
stupidly
about
him
for
a
moment
as
if
undecided
what
to
do
then
seizing
his
hat
from
the
wall
rack
he
hurried
out
through
the
studio
and
the
dark
without
pausing
to
remove
his
working
jacket
or
to
lock
the
door
out
into
the
street
where
people
were
hurrying
home
chattering
and
laughing
and
glancing
only
for
a
second
at
the
figure
in
the
velvet
studio
coat
and
broad
hat
wondering
a
little
at
the
dark
intense
face
that
flashed
so
swiftly
past
them
toward
the
glare
and
confusion
of
the
business
center
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
going
he
did
not
care
he
was
trying
to
get
away
from
himself
he
walked
faster
and
faster
twice
he
started
to
run
he
was
drawing
nearer
to
the
bustle
of
the
city
small
shops
were
scattered
along
between
the
rows
of
brick
dwellings
and
at
one
corner
the
light
of
a
saloon
flared
out
upon
the
pavement
entering
he
called
for
brandy
the
stared
at
him
and
set
out
a
bottle
and
a
glass
twice
he
filled
it
to
the
brim
and
drank
it
off
with
hardly
a
pause
between
then
throwing
down
a
silver
dollar
he
hastened
out
without
waiting
for
change
the
shops
were
getting
thicker
and
larger
were
fewer
and
more
old
fashioned
here
and
there
newsboys
were
crying
the
evening
papers
filled
with
lights
and
faces
rolled
swiftly
by
him
and
in
front
of
him
jangling
their
bells
the
buzz
and
whirl
of
the
city
was
around
him
he
was
drawing
near
to
its
great
throbbing
heart
splendid
shop
windows
threw
a
flood
of
light
upon
the
pavement
making
it
like
day
the
shouts
of
the
newsboys
and
street
venders
the
jangling
of
the
the
rushing
cabs
and
carriages
the
hurrying
crowds
the
brilliant
lights
the
liquor
in
his
brain
all
whirled
together
and
sent
the
blood
racing
through
his
arteries
tingling
to
the
surface
now
and
again
in
burning
waves
of
misery
and
shame
people
paused
for
a
moment
to
look
at
the
strange
figure
and
hurried
on
everybody
was
hurrying
hurrying
somewhere
he
too
was
hurrying
as
one
pursued
by
furies
but
where
suddenly
in
front
of
an
illuminated
window
he
paused
why
he
did
not
know
there
was
nothing
there
to
attract
him
it
was
a
place
where
they
sold
shoes
numberless
shoes
were
arranged
for
display
and
in
the
midst
of
them
a
little
white
revolving
by
with
two
words
painted
on
it
in
black
letters
gentlemen
shoes
he
read
the
words
over
and
over
as
the
little
globe
came
round
and
round
and
round
gentlemen
shoes
gentlemen
shoes
shoes
the
thing
fascinated
him
it
was
such
a
funny
little
globe
it
reminded
him
of
a
he
had
once
ridden
on
as
a
child
he
wondered
how
many
times
a
day
it
spelled
out
the
words
and
if
it
kept
on
going
there
in
the
dark
after
the
place
was
closed
then
he
hurried
on
but
the
little
white
globe
and
its
black
flying
letters
were
still
before
him
they
had
impressed
their
image
upon
his
brain
more
than
once
he
repeated
the
words
aloud
they
seemed
to
have
blended
themselves
into
his
whirling
senses
and
become
a
monotonous
undertone
gentlemen
shoes
gentlemen
shoes
gentlemen
shoes
here
and
there
he
stopped
at
a
saloon
and
drank
he
drank
deeply
and
the
liquor
was
strong
the
lights
were
beginning
to
grow
fewer
he
had
turned
in
his
walk
and
was
leaving
the
whirl
and
glare
behind
him
he
did
not
know
what
direction
he
had
taken
he
only
knew
that
he
was
going
going
going
in
a
mad
effort
to
get
away
from
himself
the
people
that
passed
him
he
did
not
see
he
saw
only
the
white
face
of
eva
delorme
and
that
piteous
look
in
the
eyes
of
the
other
that
had
in
one
instant
revived
within
him
and
with
vigor
all
the
strange
torturing
suspicions
he
had
once
felt
regarding
these
two
mysterious
lives
the
faces
that
turned
to
look
at
him
he
did
not
notice
he
saw
only
these
two
and
mingled
with
them
and
whirling
round
and
round
and
round
the
little
white
globe
with
its
black
letters
gentlemen
shoes
gentlemen
shoes
gentlemen
shoes
after
a
long
time
he
noticed
that
he
was
passing
a
small
suburban
railway
station
there
was
a
bustle
of
preparation
as
though
a
train
was
expected
to
arrive
he
crossed
the
shining
steel
tracks
and
entered
a
number
of
people
were
inside
chattering
laughing
and
waiting
waiting
to
go
somewhere
everybody
was
going
somewhere
everybody
but
him
suddenly
a
group
in
one
corner
attracted
him
as
had
the
lighted
window
and
the
revolving
globe
a
woman
wearing
a
faded
straw
hat
of
antique
pattern
a
cloak
to
match
and
a
soiled
and
largely
plaided
dress
was
vainly
endeavoring
to
still
the
cries
of
a
miserable
babe
swaddled
in
an
assortment
of
dirty
garments
two
children
of
ages
evidently
beginning
at
prompt
and
regular
intervals
from
the
one
in
her
arms
extended
from
her
at
on
the
bench
their
legs
straddled
about
with
a
childish
disregard
of
modesty
they
were
asleep
at
least
one
of
them
was
and
the
other
was
equally
silent
by
and
by
the
woman
arose
and
walked
the
floor
with
the
babe
at
this
the
child
who
was
not
asleep
arose
also
and
stared
at
its
mother
with
wide
round
eyes
then
as
she
approached
it
and
turned
in
her
march
it
began
to
follow
her
keeping
close
behind
and
in
step
the
other
slept
on
unconsciously
the
lamps
flared
and
flickered
the
babe
partially
soothed
sobbed
and
moaned
and
the
squalid
pair
marched
on
begotten
in
bliss
brought
forth
in
suffering
retired
in
privation
suddenly
there
is
a
prolonged
shrill
shriek
in
the
night
a
trampling
of
many
feet
a
shouting
of
discordant
voices
and
the
midnight
train
is
snorting
at
the
platform
hastily
the
mother
gathers
up
the
sleeping
child
and
bidding
the
other
cling
close
to
her
skirts
hurries
out
into
the
night
past
the
polyphemus
on
toward
the
coaches
behind
the
people
that
are
going
somewhere
jostle
against
her
in
their
haste
to
get
into
the
coaches
and
secure
seats
mechanically
the
artist
follows
everybody
is
going
somewhere
he
will
go
too
the
monster
ahead
begins
to
puff
and
grunt
and
the
bell
that
is
fastened
to
its
back
to
ring
wildly
the
men
who
are
loading
baggage
shout
and
swear
and
hurl
coarse
jokes
at
each
other
and
the
midnight
train
begins
to
move
the
bell
still
clangs
frantically
the
demon
puffs
and
grunts
faster
and
faster
and
the
light
from
its
one
fearful
eye
penetrates
farther
and
farther
into
the
darkness
ahead
faster
and
faster
and
faster
the
sound
of
the
wheels
falling
into
a
regular
measure
until
it
has
become
a
weird
rhythmical
monotone
gentlemen
shoes
gentlemen
shoes
gentlemen
shoes
then
there
is
a
momentary
flare
of
light
a
final
scream
and
the
demon
the
faded
and
soiled
woman
the
sobbing
baby
the
sleeping
child
the
marching
child
with
the
big
round
eyes
the
people
who
are
going
somewhere
and
the
artist
who
is
going
nowhere
are
on
their
way
he
has
taken
a
seat
facing
the
faded
woman
and
is
unconsciously
studying
her
face
she
is
still
hushing
the
babe
to
rest
on
one
side
the
sleeper
is
huddled
up
against
her
on
the
other
next
to
the
window
and
resting
upon
its
knees
the
child
with
the
big
round
eyes
stares
out
into
the
darkness
the
coach
is
warm
the
heat
and
the
strong
liquor
are
beginning
to
tell
on
him
the
face
before
him
begins
to
mingle
with
all
sorts
of
impossible
fancies
the
roar
of
the
flying
train
is
in
his
ears
but
it
seems
the
roar
of
some
mighty
sea
that
is
about
to
overwhelm
him
the
conductor
coming
through
shakes
his
arm
to
rouse
him
tickets
oh
yes
he
forgot
he
thrusts
a
bill
into
the
conductor
hand
keep
the
change
i
will
ride
it
out
the
drowsiness
is
again
stealing
upon
him
he
still
sees
the
wretched
face
before
him
and
is
studying
it
but
always
between
them
are
those
other
faces
the
face
of
eva
delorme
and
of
evelin
march
and
the
piteous
frightened
look
that
rests
now
upon
one
now
upon
the
other
and
now
the
two
are
melting
melting
into
one
like
the
blending
outlines
of
a
dissolving
view
and
both
fade
out
into
the
little
white
globe
with
its
whirling
black
words
that
the
hum
of
the
train
flying
through
the
night
keeps
repeating
over
and
over
and
over
gentlemen
shoes
gentlemen
shoes
gentlemen
shoes
vii
the
sky
was
beginning
to
get
gray
with
morning
when
the
night
express
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
its
starting
point
rushed
into
a
little
station
and
halted
a
moment
for
water
panting
and
fretting
to
be
on
its
way
a
figure
stepped
from
it
to
the
platform
staggering
a
little
as
from
the
motion
of
the
train
it
was
a
young
man
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
his
face
stained
with
the
grime
of
travel
his
soft
felt
hat
and
his
short
velvet
coat
were
covered
with
cinders
and
dust
one
would
hardly
have
recognized
the
artist
julian
goetze
the
station
agent
stood
a
few
feet
away
with
a
lantern
he
looked
up
somewhat
astonished
as
this
odd
figure
approached
him
some
drunken
showman
he
thought
the
man
came
closer
as
if
to
speak
to
him
how
far
back
to
saint
louis
he
asked
anxiously
one
hundred
and
miles
when
can
i
get
a
train
at
if
it
on
time
is
it
usually
on
time
hardly
ever
four
hours
late
yesterday
good
god
is
there
no
other
train
there
a
cattle
train
lying
up
there
on
the
switch
now
pulls
out
soon
as
this
one
leaves
and
what
time
will
that
reach
saint
louis
no
telling
depends
upon
what
luck
it
has
possibly
by
four
or
five
the
artist
did
not
wait
to
hear
more
anything
was
better
than
remaining
here
on
an
uncertainty
he
sped
away
up
the
track
to
where
lay
the
long
line
of
waiting
cars
he
had
been
awakened
by
the
stopping
of
the
train
and
a
realization
of
affairs
had
flashed
over
him
like
lightning
he
was
far
away
from
saint
louis
and
at
six
that
night
he
had
an
appointment
with
eva
delorme
the
effects
of
his
and
the
strong
liquor
had
worn
away
the
fever
and
the
delirium
of
last
night
were
as
a
bad
dream
he
would
hasten
back
to
eva
he
had
sinned
fallen
almost
to
the
lowest
depth
but
it
was
over
now
he
would
see
evelin
march
no
more
if
eva
accepted
him
they
would
go
away
at
once
oh
if
kind
providence
would
but
help
him
to
reach
the
appointment
in
time
the
conductor
whom
he
asked
noting
his
anxiety
assured
him
that
it
was
quite
probable
they
would
reach
the
city
by
five
it
was
growing
light
rather
slowly
the
sky
was
overcast
with
clouds
and
the
air
had
the
feeling
of
a
storm
it
seemed
to
julian
that
the
train
crept
along
like
a
farm
wagon
for
a
long
time
he
looked
out
at
the
gray
monotonous
landscape
then
he
lay
down
on
the
cushioned
benches
of
the
caboose
and
tried
to
sleep
now
and
then
he
would
doze
a
little
but
his
mind
was
too
full
of
anxiety
and
impatience
to
obtain
rest
terrifying
dreams
forced
themselves
upon
him
and
he
awoke
often
sick
and
frightened
and
so
through
that
dreary
autumn
day
the
heavy
train
rumbled
along
across
the
wide
stretch
of
country
that
divided
him
from
that
which
fate
was
at
that
moment
busily
preparing
an
experience
as
strange
as
weird
as
terribly
fantastic
as
was
ever
accorded
to
human
being
before
the
little
swiss
cottage
of
julian
goetze
was
very
silent
that
day
all
through
the
forenoon
no
one
entered
although
the
street
door
was
unlocked
and
the
studio
door
was
open
as
the
afternoon
wore
away
the
clouds
and
smoke
that
hung
heavily
over
the
city
seemed
to
settle
lower
and
lower
until
within
the
narrow
it
was
almost
dark
just
after
the
clock
on
the
mantel
of
the
inner
room
had
chimed
three
a
cloaked
figure
passed
through
the
hall
and
entered
the
studio
it
was
evelin
march
her
eye
fell
upon
the
portrait
of
eva
delorme
still
resting
upon
the
easel
and
she
glanced
about
hastily
for
the
artist
he
was
not
there
for
some
reason
she
did
not
remove
her
wrap
but
stood
still
listening
a
wagon
rattled
by
outside
but
within
all
was
silent
paul
she
called
softly
there
was
no
reply
he
has
stepped
out
for
a
moment
she
thought
he
will
be
back
presently
she
approached
the
face
on
the
easel
cautiously
as
though
it
were
alive
i
wonder
who
she
is
she
muttered
i
have
seen
her
somewhere
before
or
i
have
dreamed
it
he
said
it
was
his
masterpiece
i
hate
her
she
seated
herself
before
the
picture
studying
it
silently
little
by
little
a
fear
invaded
her
bosom
a
strange
fear
such
as
she
had
never
known
before
a
fear
of
this
portrait
of
the
lonely
room
of
the
weapons
upon
the
wall
it
seemed
to
her
that
something
horrible
was
about
to
happen
she
started
up
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
to
drive
away
this
feeling
why
did
the
artist
not
come
she
parted
back
the
draperies
and
looked
into
the
room
beyond
he
could
not
have
gone
far
his
coat
was
hanging
upon
the
rack
and
his
velvet
studio
jacket
was
gone
entering
she
approached
the
coat
and
put
her
hand
against
it
in
a
sort
of
caress
how
she
loved
him
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
or
forgiven
the
offered
insult
of
yesterday
turning
back
the
garment
she
touched
her
lips
to
the
silk
lining
where
it
had
covered
his
heart
as
she
did
so
she
noticed
the
tinted
edge
of
a
narrow
envelope
in
the
inner
pocket
in
an
instant
she
was
seized
with
a
passion
of
curiosity
all
her
jealousy
and
suspicions
of
the
girl
in
gray
came
rushing
back
she
listened
at
the
curtained
arch
for
a
moment
but
there
was
no
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
then
her
eyes
flashing
and
her
cheeks
flaming
guiltily
she
snatched
the
delicate
missive
from
its
concealment
and
with
trembling
hands
tore
it
from
its
covering
in
another
instant
her
suspicions
were
verified
the
woman
reading
seemed
suddenly
to
have
become
deranged
coward
liar
cur
she
screamed
she
tore
the
letter
in
halves
crumpled
it
in
her
hands
and
flung
it
upon
the
floor
then
suddenly
becoming
calm
she
gathered
up
the
pieces
hastily
and
concealed
them
in
her
bosom
a
look
of
peculiar
cunning
had
come
into
her
eyes
so
he
is
going
to
meet
her
she
muttered
savagely
but
they
will
not
meet
alone
i
too
will
go
to
no
west
l
street
east
side
then
she
hesitated
perhaps
i
would
not
be
admitted
she
thought
plans
for
overcoming
this
obstacle
flashed
through
her
brain
like
lightning
she
seized
upon
what
appeared
to
her
the
most
feasible
if
i
will
counterfeit
her
she
said
feverishly
i
will
disguise
myself
she
hurried
back
into
the
studio
and
stood
for
a
moment
before
the
easel
yes
yes
she
could
do
it
her
figure
was
much
the
same
dress
gray
and
plain
hair
low
upon
the
forehead
a
veil
would
make
it
complete
oh
she
muttered
how
i
hate
your
baby
face
look
i
will
kill
you
you
fool
you
fool
again
that
sickening
fascinating
terror
of
this
unknown
woman
came
upon
her
hastily
turning
from
the
portrait
she
listened
a
second
for
the
artist
step
as
she
did
so
her
eye
caught
the
weapons
on
the
wall
without
a
moment
hesitation
she
plucked
the
stiletto
from
its
place
and
concealing
it
beneath
her
cloak
hurried
from
the
house
an
hour
later
the
artist
burst
into
the
studio
his
bloodshot
eyes
and
face
blackened
with
travel
made
him
almost
unrecognizable
hurrying
through
to
his
room
beyond
he
glanced
eagerly
at
the
clock
it
was
on
the
stroke
of
five
just
time
to
make
myself
presentable
and
reach
the
place
by
six
he
thought
then
turning
he
surveyed
himself
in
a
mirror
good
heavens
what
a
spectacle
i
am
people
must
have
thought
i
was
a
maniac
and
they
were
not
far
from
wrong
but
i
am
all
right
now
i
am
going
to
eva
and
confess
my
villainy
and
ask
her
forgiveness
i
will
swear
my
faith
to
her
she
will
forgive
me
she
must
forgive
me
and
as
for
evelin
all
is
over
with
her
after
what
passed
last
night
last
night
was
it
only
last
night
it
seemed
an
age
he
made
a
quick
motion
as
if
to
drive
away
an
unpleasant
memory
then
throwing
off
his
outer
garments
he
opened
the
door
of
a
little
i
will
bathe
and
confess
and
be
born
again
he
said
with
a
little
laugh
twenty
minutes
afterward
he
emerged
a
new
man
in
reality
as
far
as
outward
appearances
were
concerned
cleanly
shaven
and
scrupulously
attired
no
one
would
have
recognized
in
him
the
dusty
figure
of
an
hour
before
he
glanced
at
the
clock
yes
i
have
plenty
of
time
he
thought
no
west
l
street
east
side
i
will
look
at
her
letter
again
to
make
sure
bless
her
sweet
face
i
can
hardly
wait
until
i
see
it
again
if
she
only
is
not
ill
but
good
god
it
is
gone
he
had
looked
in
the
breast
pocket
of
his
street
coat
that
still
hung
on
the
rack
it
was
empty
he
stood
holding
the
coat
with
a
puzzled
expression
on
his
face
trying
to
think
i
know
i
put
it
in
that
pocket
i
recollect
it
distinctly
he
said
aloud
perhaps
it
fell
out
when
i
took
off
my
coat
he
looked
hastily
about
the
floor
then
hurried
out
into
the
studio
searching
rapidly
and
carefully
his
face
grew
more
and
more
troubled
could
anyone
have
come
in
during
his
absence
and
picked
it
up
perhaps
harry
had
been
here
if
so
it
was
safe
as
he
stood
there
reflecting
trying
to
solve
the
mystery
he
was
looking
directly
at
the
weapons
upon
the
wall
all
at
once
he
noticed
that
there
was
something
different
about
their
arrangement
something
was
missing
it
was
the
dagger
then
it
all
came
to
him
evelin
he
shouted
good
god
he
had
wasted
valuable
time
searching
for
the
letter
he
could
hardly
reach
the
place
of
appointment
by
six
unless
he
could
catch
some
kind
of
a
vehicle
my
god
my
god
she
will
kill
her
she
will
kill
her
and
all
through
my
treachery
he
had
fled
from
the
house
and
was
now
speeding
wildly
westward
no
cab
was
in
sight
and
he
could
not
wait
to
find
one
she
will
kill
her
she
will
kill
her
he
groaned
over
and
over
oh
my
god
my
god
viii
at
a
quarter
before
six
a
woman
ascended
the
marble
steps
of
the
old
mansion
at
no
west
l
street
east
side
she
wore
a
plain
dress
of
material
a
rich
persian
shawl
a
neat
walking
hat
her
face
thickly
veiled
reaching
the
door
she
laid
her
gloved
hand
on
the
knob
then
hesitated
as
if
undecided
whether
to
enter
at
once
or
ring
the
heavy
clouds
hung
oppressively
low
and
it
was
already
dusk
a
few
flakes
of
snow
were
falling
but
it
was
not
cold
all
at
once
the
woman
removed
her
hand
from
the
door
slipped
off
her
shawl
and
threw
it
across
her
arm
as
she
did
so
some
thing
glittered
bright
which
she
hastily
concealed
beneath
the
shawl
as
she
stood
now
she
was
the
exact
counterpart
of
eva
delorme
then
without
further
hesitation
she
laid
hold
of
and
turned
the
heavy
knob
of
the
massive
black
door
it
yielded
noiselessly
and
she
entered
closing
it
as
noiselessly
behind
her
within
all
was
dark
a
faint
ray
of
light
crept
in
through
the
transom
penetrating
a
few
feet
into
the
blackness
she
stood
almost
against
the
door
listening
and
hardly
breathing
all
was
silent
she
had
expected
the
other
to
be
there
before
her
waiting
for
his
coming
she
put
out
her
hand
and
felt
about
her
she
touched
a
chair
at
her
left
and
softly
laid
her
shawl
upon
it
keeping
firm
hold
upon
the
keen
weapon
she
had
carried
beneath
it
she
listened
again
still
no
sound
she
was
growing
impatient
she
took
a
few
steps
forward
keeping
one
hand
extended
in
front
of
her
to
avoid
collision
then
she
turned
and
retraced
her
steps
she
had
been
very
cool
thus
far
but
she
was
losing
control
of
herself
why
did
she
not
come
she
had
said
in
her
letter
that
she
was
ill
pshaw
it
was
but
a
trick
to
arouse
his
sympathy
she
must
come
must
she
paced
back
and
forth
in
the
small
space
which
she
had
explored
and
found
free
from
obstruction
three
steps
forward
and
turn
three
steps
back
and
turn
pausing
each
time
to
hold
her
breath
and
listen
while
the
fingers
of
her
left
hand
involuntarily
crept
down
and
pressed
against
the
keen
point
of
the
dagger
until
it
pierced
through
her
glove
and
entered
the
tender
flesh
suddenly
a
white
ray
of
light
shot
through
the
transom
above
her
falling
at
an
angle
against
a
projection
in
the
wall
at
her
left
and
dimly
illuminating
the
entire
place
it
was
six
and
the
large
arc
light
just
outside
was
turned
on
then
as
she
reached
the
door
and
whirled
quickly
in
her
march
she
saw
her
for
whom
she
waited
standing
at
the
extreme
farther
end
of
the
long
hall
between
them
was
what
appeared
to
be
a
narrow
and
ornamented
archway
she
could
dimly
distinguish
the
figure
clad
in
gray
the
face
like
her
own
was
veiled
she
noticed
with
quick
satisfaction
that
her
disguise
was
perfect
the
counterpart
was
exact
even
to
the
smallest
detail
without
hesitation
and
concealing
the
dagger
in
the
folds
of
her
dress
she
advanced
quickly
and
silently
toward
her
rival
who
somewhat
to
her
surprise
instead
of
fleeing
or
crying
out
also
advanced
she
was
going
to
try
strength
with
her
i
will
kill
her
with
a
blow
she
muttered
they
were
now
within
a
few
feet
of
each
other
the
ornamented
arch
exactly
between
them
suddenly
evelin
march
snatched
the
dagger
from
its
concealment
and
raised
it
aloft
to
strike
as
she
did
so
her
rival
made
precisely
the
same
movement
and
something
glittered
in
her
hand
also
both
took
a
quick
forward
step
and
each
at
the
same
instant
struck
fiercely
with
a
swinging
downward
blow
a
hissing
metallic
report
a
low
moan
and
the
sound
of
a
falling
body
then
silence
a
moment
later
the
hall
door
burst
open
for
a
second
time
and
in
the
flood
of
electric
light
that
poured
in
julian
paul
goetze
saw
a
gray
veiled
figure
stretched
upon
the
floor
the
gloved
hand
clasping
a
jeweled
hilt
the
blade
of
which
was
buried
in
her
bosom
a
stream
of
crimson
was
discoloring
the
fabric
of
her
dress
and
spreading
in
a
dark
pool
on
the
rich
carpet
rushing
forward
he
caught
up
the
prostrate
form
and
tore
away
the
veil
then
as
if
by
magic
a
revelation
swept
over
him
in
one
mighty
wave
of
horror
strange
piteous
look
he
had
once
seen
on
the
face
of
evelin
march
was
again
before
him
and
while
he
gazed
he
saw
it
melting
melting
almost
insensibly
like
the
blending
outlines
of
a
dissolving
view
into
the
saintly
loveliness
of
eva
the
mists
of
doubt
the
shadows
of
suspicion
and
the
fever
of
curiosity
that
had
troubled
him
during
those
feverish
months
were
suddenly
swept
away
eva
delorme
evelin
march
one
and
the
same
one
body
one
soul
one
heart
by
some
strange
freak
of
nature
some
wild
mental
vagary
or
devilish
witchery
of
which
he
could
not
know
made
two
in
life
but
only
one
in
death
above
her
was
a
heavy
mirror
in
an
ornamented
frame
cracked
entirely
across
from
its
polished
surface
the
glancing
dagger
had
found
its
way
to
the
one
troubled
heart
of
those
two
strange
lives
and
brought
to
it
silence
and
restfulness
forever
