notes
in
addition
to
the
notes
below
and
so
you
will
think
all
the
spelling
errors
introduced
by
the
printers
of
the
time
have
been
corrected
here
are
the
first
few
lines
of
hamlet
as
they
are
presented
herein
barnardo
who
there
fran
nay
answer
me
stand
vnfold
your
selfe
bar
long
liue
the
king
as
i
understand
it
the
printers
often
ran
out
of
certain
words
or
letters
they
had
often
packed
into
a
cliche
is
the
original
meaning
of
the
term
cliche
thus
being
unwilling
to
unpack
the
cliches
and
thus
you
will
see
some
substitutions
that
look
very
odd
as
the
exchanges
of
u
for
v
v
for
u
above
you
may
wonder
why
they
did
it
this
way
presuming
shakespeare
did
not
actually
write
the
play
in
this
manner
the
answer
is
that
they
may
have
packed
liue
into
a
cliche
at
a
time
when
they
were
out
of
v
having
used
vv
in
place
of
some
w
etc
this
was
a
common
practice
of
the
day
as
print
was
still
quite
expensive
and
they
did
want
to
spend
more
on
a
wider
selection
of
characters
than
they
had
to
you
will
find
a
lot
of
these
kinds
of
errors
in
this
text
as
i
have
mentioned
in
other
times
and
places
many
scholars
have
an
extreme
attachment
to
these
errors
and
many
have
accorded
them
a
very
high
place
in
the
canon
of
shakespeare
my
father
read
an
assortment
of
these
made
available
to
him
by
cambridge
university
in
england
for
several
months
in
a
glass
room
constructed
for
the
purpose
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
he
read
all
those
available
great
detail
determined
from
the
various
changes
that
shakespeare
most
likely
did
not
write
in
nearly
as
many
of
a
variety
of
errors
we
credit
him
for
even
though
he
was
for
signing
his
name
with
several
different
spellings
so
please
take
this
into
account
when
reading
the
comments
below
made
by
our
volunteer
who
prepared
this
file
you
may
see
errors
that
are
not
errors
so
this
caveat
have
not
changed
the
canon
errors
here

scanner
notes
what
this
is
and
is
this
was
taken
from
a
copy
of
shakespeare
first
folio
and
it
is
as
close
as
i
can
come
in
ascii
to
the
printed
text
the
elongated
s
have
been
changed
to
small
s
and
the
conjoined
ae
have
been
changed
to
ae
i
have
left
the
spelling
punctuation
capitalization
as
close
as
possible
to
the
printed
text
i
have
corrected
some
spelling
mistakes
i
have
put
together
a
spelling
dictionary
devised
from
the
spellings
of
the
geneva
bible
and
shakespeare
first
folio
and
have
unified
spellings
according
to
this
template
typo
and
expanded
abbreviations
as
i
have
come
across
them
everything
within
brackets
is
what
i
have
added
so
if
you
do
like
that
you
can
delete
everything
within
the
brackets
if
you
want
a
purer
shakespeare
another
thing
that
you
should
be
aware
of
is
that
there
are
textual
differences
between
various
copies
of
the
first
folio
so
there
may
be
differences
other
than
what
i
have
mentioned
above
between
this
and
other
first
folio
editions
this
is
due
to
the
habit
of
setting
the
type
and
running
off
a
number
of
copies
and
then
proofing
the
printed
copy
and
correcting
the
type
and
then
continuing
the
printing
run
the
proof
run
was
thrown
away
but
incorporated
into
the
printed
copies
this
is
just
the
way
it
is
the
text
i
have
used
was
a
composite
of
more
than
different
first
folio
editions
best
pages
if
you

any

my

please
feel

hath
receiu
eight
thousand
nobles
in

for
your

soldiers
the
which
he
hath
detain
for
lewd
employments
like
a
false
traitor
and
iniurious
villaine
besides
i

and
will
in
battaile
proue
or
heere
or
elsewhere
to
the
furthest
verge
that
euer
was
suruey
by

eye
that
all
the
treasons
for
these
eighteene
yeeres
complotted
and
contriued
in
this
land
fetch
from
false
mowbray
their
first
head
and
spring
further
i
say
and
further
will
maintaine
vpon
his
bad
life
to
make
all
this
good
that
he
did
plot
the
duke
of
glousters
death
suggest
his
soone
beleeuing
aduersaries
and
consequently
like
a
traitor
coward
sluc
out
his
innocent
soule
through
streames
of

which
blood
like
sacrificing
abels
cries
euen
from

quarta
enter
richard
rich
i
haue
bin
studying
how
to
compare
this
prison
where
i
liue
vnto
the
world
and
for
because
the
world
is
populous
and
heere

not

my

i
can
not
do
it
yet
ile
out
my

ile
proue
the
female
to
my
soule
my
soule
the
father
and
these
two
beget
a
generation
of
still
breeding
thoughts
and
these
same
thoughts
people
this
little
world
in
humors
like
the
people
of
this
world
for
no
thought
is
contented
the
better
sort
as
thoughts
of
things
diuine
are
intermixt
with
scruples
and
do
set
the
faith
it
selfe
against
the
faith
as
thus
come
litle
ones
then
again
it
is
as
hard
to
come
as
for
a
camell
to
thred
the
posterne
of
a
needles
eye
thoughts
tending
to
ambition
they
do
plot
vnlikely
wonders
how
these
vaine
weake
nailes
may
teare
a
passage
through
the
flinty
ribbes
of
this
hard
world
my
ragged
prison
walles
and
for
they
can
not
dye
in
their
owne
pride
thoughts
tending
to
content
flatter
themselues
that
they
are
not
the
first
of
fortunes
slaues
nor
shall
not
be
the
last
like
silly
beggars
who
sitting
in
the
stockes
refuge
their
shame
that
many
haue
and
others
must
sit
there
and
in
this
thought
they
finde
a
kind
of
ease
bearing
their
owne
misfortune
on
the
backe
of
such
as
haue
before
indur

like
thus
